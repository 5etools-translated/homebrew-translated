Though they often control the trade through sheer numbers and economic coordination, it was not uncommon for the guild to be granted official authority by the local ruler, making it illegal to practice without membership."

					"Craft Guild: This is a typical medieval guild. The craft guild comprises skilled artisans who all create items of the same type. Depending on the size of the city and economy it could be as broad as a 'metalworkers' guild, or as specific as a silversmith or coopers' guild."
				],
				[
					"31-45",
					"Merchant Guild: Merchant guilds may be organized by type of product, region or trade routes. They're primarily an organization for those who sell physical products, though some regulate skilled labourers such as physicians or tinkers."
				],
				[
					"46-50",
					"Cartel: A cartel is an organization of craftsmen and/or merchants with the specific intent to fix prices, production and/or public image. Many other guilds are also cartels or a cartel may include members of various other guilds."
				],
				[
					"51-53",
					"Trade/Labour Union: A far less  common type of guild. These unions comprised the lower skilled, or at least the less stationed, members of a craft or labour to protect their common interests and help combat the power of other guilds. These may be more common in societies with large Adventurers Guilds to help organize the many hirelings employed in such endeavours."
				],
				[
					"54-60",
					"Religious Guild: Priests, clerics and the like have their own orders and churches. They have much of the same traits of a guild but their focus usually puts economics second to piety. Religious guilds are still common amongst laypeople, such as when all craftspeople among multiple fields come together under the banner of a common god. Like cartels, often another type of guild will also be a religious guild."
				],
				[
					"61-62",
					"Frith Guild: A group of upstanding citizens who pass judgement on the law. These individuals are often nobles or appointed by the ruling lord. Some frith guilds are actually secret societies, with their own laws that carry out vigilante justice against those who wrong their members and escape normal justice."
				],
				[
					"63-66",
					"Scholars'/Masters' Guild: A predecessor to universities, these are associations of masters, or their students, throughout a city. They are often from completely different fields but united by status and their love of academic study. They are centres of learning."
				],
				[
					"67-72",
					"Adventurers' Guild: Job postings, cheap beds, good beer and the rights to legally loot abandoned structures; an adventurer's guild is a PC's second home in the city. Particularly popular in areas surrounded by ruins or towns with a weak military presence."
				],
				[
					"73-76",
					"Arcanist Guild: Much like a masters' guild, the arcanists' guild is the foundation schools spring from. Arcanists guilds are often supported by governments as a matter of public safety, providing oversight as young mages learn the proper ways of spells and incantations. "
				],
				[
					"77-80",
					"Bardic Guild: Loremasters, jesters, storytellers, dancers, actors, playwrights and even the classic adventuring bard all belong to the bardic guild. It's the best place to find work, obtain public performance permits and swap stories. "
				],
				[
					"81-83",
					"Companion Guild: Formal organization of prostitutes, courtiers and courtesans. As a profession that needs very little to get started, practitioners organize into guilds more often in large societies with minimal laws, as a means of protection, or in heavily affluent societies were formal training is needed as a matter of course. "
				],
				[
					"84-86",
					"Thieves' Guild: A breeding ground for those who act outside of society and ignore property laws. It's the best place to find a fence, pick up speciality tools or grab a job. "
				],

					"Assassins' Guild: Much like the thieves' guild the assassins' guild generally operates outside the law, though some may be government sponsored. "
				],
				[
					"88-92",
					"Fraternity/Sorority: An organization dedicated to the development and prosperity of its members. These organizations often cross-occupational boundaries but are bound by a deep devotion to each member. While not technically economic in nature, wealth and prosperity go hand in hand. "
				],
				[
					"93-96",
					"Racial Guild: Much like a fraternity or sorority but bound by a common blood. These organizations focus on a single minority race in a society, but may also be applied to another type of guild, such as the Guild of Halfling Weavers. "
				],
				[
					"97-100",
					"Secret Society: Not all organizations flourish in the public eye. When popular culture or the law frowns upon how you wish to get things done secret societies form to provide like-minded individuals a place to do business. Cartels, thieves' guilds and assassins' guilds are often secret but any kind of guild can be secret. Some secret societies even have a public face, but keep their rites and dealings known only to members. "
