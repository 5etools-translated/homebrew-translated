						"{@i The Crypts of Kelemvor} is a one-shot Dungeons & Dragons adventure for characters of levels 3 to 5, adapted from a quest in Neverwinter online. This scenario sees the adventuring party given an important quest to collect a number of broken magical seals and to light a number of magical braziers, all of which once protected the crypts of Kelemvor. In so doing, they can help to quell a devastating uprising of undead-- organized by a powerful lich named Idris bent on destroying the city of Neverwinter.",

The characters are tasked with finding and collecting items, but must also \"click\" parts of the environment as they explore--the braziers whose magical light is anathema to undead. In addition to the normal tricks the adventurers can use as they face off against the undead of the crypts, the light of the sacred braziers can be used as a weapon. Additionally, the end of the scenario gives the characters a chance to interact with another adventuring party--a band known as the Grave Robbers.",
								"{@b Sacred Braziers of Balance.} When one of these magical braziers is lit, its fire bursts forth in a bright blue flame that fills a 25-foot-radius area with bright blue-white light. For the first 3 rounds after a brazier is lit, any undead creature that starts its turn within the brazier's light takes 16 ({@dice 3d10}}) radiant damage--presenting a significant threat to such creatures. The length of time it takes to light the braziers is the wild card. A character adjacent to a brazier must use an action to light it, but doing so requires a special striking rod and stone, as.  well as a successful DC 12 Dexterity check.",
								"{@b The Grave Robbers.} Before the main boss fight at the end of the scenario, the characters come across an adventuring party known as the Grave Robbers. Three of that party's original four members face off against the characters (with their cleric having been found eaten in an earlier part of the dungeon). You can play the Grave Robbers as greedy and spoiling for a fight, or you can portray them as pragmatic and willing to work with the characters to complete their exploration of the dungeon.",
