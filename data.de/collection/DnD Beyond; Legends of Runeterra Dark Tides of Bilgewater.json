						"Dies ist eine Welt von Champions und Monstern, von Nationen, die in Eroberungskriegen und Magie aufsteigen und fallen. Die vielen Länder von Runeterra sind voll von Abenteuern aller Art, von düsteren Straßenkämpfen bis hin zu epischen Schlachten zwischen übernatürlichen Mächten, und Bilgewater ist da keine Ausnahme. Vollgepackt mit Schmugglern, Gaunern und Schurken ist Bilgewater mehr als ein gewöhnlicher Piratenhafen, obwohl es auch hier mehr als genug Piraten gibt!",
						"Auch wenn diese Version von Bilgewater sehr detailliert beschrieben ist und sich so oft wie möglich an den Kanon von Runeterra hält, sind die Abenteuer und Handlungsstränge in dieser Quelle nicht kanonisch. Das befreit dich von der Notwendigkeit, Geschichten zu erfinden, die sich an kanonische Details halten. Erfindet so viele neue Geschichten, Gefahren und Charaktere, wie ihr wollt! Deine Version von Bilgewater ist die einzige, die wichtig ist, solange du und deine Freunde Spaß daran haben.",
						"Einige der mächtigsten Champions von Runeterra nennen Bilgewater ihre Heimat. Die schießwütigen Piratenlegenden Miss Sarah Fortune und Gangplank haben berühmt um die Kontrolle über Bilgewater gekämpft, und zahllose Schurken haben sich mit diesen kriegführenden Mächten verbündet, um an der Spitze zu stehen, wenn sich der Pulverdampf lichtet. Meister der Meerestiefen wie die gepanzerte Nautilus und okkulte Mächte wie die Krakenpriesterin Illaoi und der unheimliche Flusskönig Tahm Kench statten den schmutzigen Ufern von Bilgewater häufig einen Besuch ab.",
						"Diese Champions sind jedoch bei weitem nicht die einzigen, die in Bilgewater Wellen schlagen. Ihr habt jetzt die Möglichkeit, eure eigenen Charaktere zu erstellen und Runeterras bemerkenswertesten Hafen zu erkunden, große nautische Abenteuer auf Galeonen zu erleben, die unbarmherzigen Tiefen des Meeres zu erforschen oder in die unbekannten Geheimnisse der dunklen Magie einzutauchen, die in Bilgewaters Schatten lauert. Wenn Sie ein Spieler sind, lesen Sie zunächst die Einleitung von {@book chapter 2: Heroes and Scoundrels of Bilgewater|LoRDToB|2} und erstellen Sie Ihren Charakter.",
						"Sobald ihr eure Charaktere habt, kann euer Dungeon Master (DM) {@book chapter 3: Herald of the Harrowing|LoRDToB|3} benutzen, um die Abenteuer eurer Helden in Runeterra zu beginnen. Dieses Abenteuer ist eine vorgefertigte Geschichte, die im Bilgewasser spielt, um die Geschichten eurer Gruppe zu beginnen. Dieses Abenteuer geht davon aus, dass deine Charaktere Söldner sind, die auf der Suche nach Profit und Aufregung in den Wellen sind.",
						"Nachdem du dieses Abenteuer abgeschlossen hast, kann dein Spielleiter den Rest dieser Quelle verwenden, um brandneue Abenteuer für deine Gruppe zu erstellen. Wenn euer erstes Abenteuer vorbei ist, überlegt euch eine Hintergrundgeschichte und Eigenschaften für euren Charakter und zeigt sie eurem Spielleiter. Diese werden deinem Spielleiter helfen, eine Geschichte zu erschaffen, die dich und deine Freunde als Helden der Geschichte positioniert und nicht nur als glorifizierte Botengänger für hochstufige NSCs.",

Diese Flüchtlinge wollten der unterdrückerischen Herrschaft der Festlandfraktionen entkommen und einen Neuanfang wagen. Mit Glück und Hartnäckigkeit bauten sie sich ein Leben auf, und die Nachricht von ihrer neuen Siedlung verbreitete sich schnell. Die Bucht, die heute Bilgewater bildet, war gut versteckt, mit Anlegestellen für Schiffe übersät und, was noch besser war, mit verlassenen Ruinen als Unterschlupf versehen. Diese Eigenschaften machten sie zu einem idealen Versteck für Schiffe, und die Abneigung der Siedler gegen die Gesetze des Festlandes machte sie zu einem attraktiven Hafen für Piraten. Während die Piraterie in Runeterra mit dem Aufkommen und Niedergang von Fraktionen schwankte, blieb die Bucht ein sicherer Stützpunkt für diejenigen, die sich der eisernen Faust der Seestreitkräfte entzogen.",
								"Als immer mehr Besatzungen die Bucht zu nutzen begannen, wuchs die Siedlung unweigerlich. Händler, die mit gestohlenem Reichtum handeln wollten, und Unternehmer, die bereit waren, diese Besatzungen zu versorgen, ließen sich inmitten der Ruinen der Bucht nieder. Die abgehärteten Siedler begannen, dauerhaftere Gebäude zu errichten, wobei sie gefundene Materialien verwendeten, um auf den Fundamenten der Ruinen zu bauen.",

Sie wandten sich an die Bewohner von Bilgewater und hielten Rat mit den einflussreichsten Personen der Siedlung.

Da Bilgewater außerhalb des Gesetzes operiert, ist es einer der einzigen Orte, an dem Piratencrews gestohlene Waren sicher und gewinnbringend verkaufen können. Viele der Geschäfte in der Stadt richten sich speziell an diese Besatzungen, die nach mühsamen Einsätzen auf See mit vollen Taschen zurückkehren, um sich zu amüsieren. Da die Schlangeninseln von natürlichen Gefahren umgeben sind, können die Piratencrews ohne wirkliche Angst vor Verfolgung in die Bucht zurückkehren. Die besten Seefahrer hüten eifersüchtig das Wissen um die sicheren Routen zu den Inseln, was größere Marineschiffe dazu zwingt, die Hoffnung auf eine Landung an den Ufern aufzugeben. Die einzige wirkliche Bedrohung für die Piraten in Bilgewater geht von anderen, stärkeren Crews und gelegentlichen Kopfgeldjägern aus.",
