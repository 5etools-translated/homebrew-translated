The wall is up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute or until the pit fiend loses its concentration. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. One side of the wall, selected by the pit fiend when creating the wall, deals 36 ({@damage 8d8}) fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side deals no damage."
