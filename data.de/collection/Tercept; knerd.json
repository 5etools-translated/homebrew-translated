				"Also known as \"reveler's bane\", this disease is common among prostitutes, sailors, and amorous adventures. Despite rumours to the contrary, elves are not immune to this disease. Elves and half-elves do not display symptoms of great pox or suffer negative effects, but can readily spread the disease to other races. When a creature has sexual contact with an infected creature they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. If the infected creature is symptomatic then this saving throw has disadvantage. While there are many proposed methods of preventing infection, none of these have any actual effect.",
				"The disease lies dormant for a variable length of time, and creatures can be asymptomatic for many weeks. Symptoms of the reveler's bane appear after {@dice 2d6} weeks but the infected creature is contagious after {@dice 2d4} days. Symptoms include a rash across the hands and groin that eventually becomes painless ulcers. After each long rest, the infected creature takes 5 {@dice 2d4} poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the poison damage increases by 2 {@dice 1d4}. On a successful saving throw the damage decreases by 2 {@dice 1d4}. When a successful saving throw reduces the damage below 1 the creature symptoms go away, but the creature remain infected and must continue to make saving throws at the end of each long rest. After three consecutive failures, symptoms return, and after three consecutive successes the creature is cured."

Jungle fly fever is typically limited to tropical areas, but there are occasional outbreaks in temperate areas during warm years. After spending 12-hours in an area with insects carrying the disease, a humanoid creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Alchemical repellents, spells, and other effects that ward against insects can confer either advantage on the saving throw or outright immunity depending on the nature and potency of the effect.",

The infected creature gains 1 level of exhaustion. At the end of each long rest, the affected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure they gain @{dice 1d3} levels of exhaustion. On a success the creature's level of exhaustion is reduced by {@dice 1d3} levels. When a successful saving throw reduces the creature's level of exhaustion below 1 the disease goes into remission, but the creature remain infected and continues to make saving throws. After two consecutive failures symptoms return, and after four consecutive successes the creature is cured."

When the infected creature's level of exhaustion is reduced below 1 their fever breaks, but the secondary symptoms of the disease appear.

Additionally, the infected creature develops a strong phobia, typically towards something they already consider frightening.",

They can repeat this saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the desire to flee or the stunned condition on a success. There is no cure for the phobic malady, and sufferers remain infected until the disease is cured by spells such as lesser restoration or heal.

After each long rest the infected creature can cast the spell an additional time between rests.

A character who has proficiency with the Medicine skill can extract this fluid, which takes an hour from a living creature or half that time from a dead creature. The brain of a medium creature provides one dose and a large creature provided four doses. Taking a dose of medication allows an infected creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, curing the disease on a success."

Held items remain solid. The infection typically begins with the arms before moving onto the legs, with one limb becoming insubstantial each night.",

Prior to the infected creature's shadow being consumed the disease can be treated with minor magic. If a {@spell light|phb} or similar spell is cast on a diamond worth at least 30 gp and the infected creature swallows the gem they can make a new saving throw against the disease.
