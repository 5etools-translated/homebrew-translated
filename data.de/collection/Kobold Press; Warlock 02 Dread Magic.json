Their Red Hand ogres make excellent shock troops\u2014and their tactical sense and arcane power are quite sharp, directed by the Scarlet Heirophant Galusid and the members of the alliance of blood mages of Kaa'nesh called the Hunter's Chosen.",

It may have been a colony of Beldestani merchants, providing a port to the west connected to Reth-Sal and to the elf city of Sephaya and its surrounding fragrant gardens. It was long an independent city on the Ruby Sea, home to ogres, gnolls, and human slaves and devoted to the praise of the Hunter, the blood goddess Marena, V'ashra the Tormentor, and similar dark gods.",
								"While many cults use blood magic, the city makes a public display of its allegiance to these powers with daily offerings of fine oxen and cattle and monthly displays of human, goblin, and gnoll sacrifices, overseen by one or another of the blood mages. The hunt and the kill are present in most of the sacrifices in abbreviated form with the animal briefly \"chased\" by a priest and a humanoid victim freed from their bonds for a moment, the better to please the Hunter and fulfill his mission of winnowing out the weakest and strengthening the strong."

The night flowers cast a dim light when they bloom, illuminating the trees in blue and violet hues. Insects with sparking wings flit audibly through the undergrowth and rare beetles capable of telekinesis weave living branches into nests high in the canopy. Fey creatures are drawn to the Winewood, a fact that the keepers of Arshin's estate use to their advantage as their master did before them.",

						"Necrotic ticks are normal ticks that have gorged themselves on blood rich with negative energy. They grow unnaturally large as they feed, weighing in excess of 4 pounds when fully engorged. Most begin their voracious lives attached to the backs of animal zombies, and it is not uncommon to find a cluster of them on a single animal.",
						"When the blood of a necrotic tick's undead host runs dry, the parasite rides its victim to a new host\u2014usually an unfortunate living creature. As it sucks the living creature's blood, it leaks negative energy into the bite wound and starts a process that slowly turns the hapless victim into a zombie one pound of flesh at a time. If no potential hosts are available, ridden hosts hide in dark crevices or in trees, where they wait to pounce on the next passerby and deliver their crawling passengers.",
						"The disgusting Lord Rodyan of Hengksburg in the Blood Kingdom breeds necrotic ticks in the laboratory beneath his mansion. He is using the foul creatures to create zombies to fight for him in the city's gladiatorial arena.",
