								"Kossuth made the volcani for a purpose. They were designed as his servants, driven to build to his specifications, fight for his causes, and exist as an extension of his will. And to this end they served him well, for a time. Kossuth's dealings on the material plane were short lived, however, and he eventually found himself without need of his volcani servants. So he left them to their own devices, abandoned upon the material plane while he returned to the Plane of Fire.",
								"Though their god had left them, the volcani lived on without him, transforming their drive to work for his purposes into a desire to better themselves. While their physical appearance has mellowed over the centuries, the same cannot be said about their determination. All volcani believe they were born for a reason, and they are always searching for the purpose they believe they must fulfill. When a volcanus finds their purpose, they either complete it or die trying. For a volcanus, there is no such thing as procrastination or giving up."

								"A volcanus' soul is like a flickering flame\u2014bright and full of life, up until the moment it's snuffed out. Moreso than any other race, a volcanus' lifespan is uncertain. After reaching adulthood, a volcanus shows no more signs of aging, and can die a natural death at any point thereafter. Some might die as early as 20 years old, while others might live to the age of 80. The volcani believe that their lifespan is tied to their innate purpose\u2014when they complete that purpose, death is surely just around the corner.",
								"But for a volcanus, death isn't truly the end. Death merely signals the beginning of the next generation. When a volcanus dies, their body burns to ash\u2014colored a deep black for males and a vibrant red for females. It is from this ash that a volcanus' children are born. By taking some of the ash of an adult male volcanus, combining it with some of the ash of an adult female volcanus, and using fresh lava to set that mixture ablaze, a new volcanus is born after the flames subside. A pair of two volcani has enough ash to sire four children, but most couples only sire two or three. The memories of a volcanus are in part passed down to their children, who often see the memories of their parents in vivid dreams. These memories can also give a volcanus a natural aptitude in the skills their parents knew.",
								"The unique reproductive system of volcani, combined with their uncertain lifespans, makes it common for a volcanus to plan for their death early in life. It is almost considered a coming of age ceremony for a young adult volcanus to write their first will. A volcanus' will generally specifies what is to be done with their material possessions, like the wills of other races, but more importantly it specifies what should be done with their ashes. Married volcani will typically create joint wills, stating potential names for their future children, and how many children they wish to have. Unmarried volcani are expected to donate their ashes their community, so that they might be used for adoption purposes. Another oddity of volcanus culture is the creation of a personal urn, which a volcanus either commissions or forges themself. These urns are heavily decorated with symbols telling the life story the volcanus they were made for, and are used to hold and transport a volcanus' ashes upon their death."

But their most unique feature is the shape of their head, which is characterized by a set of three tentacle-like protrusions from the back of their skull, as well as pairs of smaller protrusions set into their slender face.",

While other astrans can easily tell their kind apart, most others need to study their features for at least a few moments before coming to a conclusion. If in doubt, all astrans can be set apart by their uniquely colored eyes, which can take on nearly any color and often contain complex patterns that are as unique as fingerprints.",

They grow quickly, reaching their full size in approximately 1-2 years.",

Some older astrans watch the night sky for shooting stars, and trek great distances to find where meteorites have landed.

These changes happen so slowly that they are nearly unnoticeable, however, and only similarly long lived races, like elves, would have a chance of noticing an astran's aging.",

This fear often fades over time, and they might make friends with other long-lived races, particularly elves, once they have a few centuries behind them. While they tend to make their homes in places untraveled by other folk, they don't actively avoid other races when those folk happen upon their humble abodes, and in fact they often welcome their visitors inside and are eager to share their wisdom with individuals that would appreciate it.
