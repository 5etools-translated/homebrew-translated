						"Though many of the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons are filled with strife, from dragon attacks, to bandit attacks, to evil liches luring the living into their lairs to join their undead armies, it's important to remember that there are still times of joy and revelry. Calendars are dotted with holidays to honor deities or celebrate important historic events. Carnivals travel between cities and towns across the land, bringing performers, games, and attractions for all manner of folk to enjoy.",
						"Festivals, Feasts & Fairs is intended to help you turn your \"pleasant downtime\" into a fully interactive experience for your adventuring party. Instead of rolling a dice on a simple chart to see if they got sick from eating fair food or won a pet goldfish in a game, you can create a colorful environment full of activities, NPCs, and plot hooks.",
						"A festival or holiday can help introduce your players to a new town or culture. You can learn a lot about people by observing what, why, and how they celebrate. Instead of waiting for the party to poke and prod at NPCs to learn about their surroundings, much of it is proudly on display, or even shoved directly in front of them.",
						"Holidays mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. In a modern age, it can become easy to be soured by ideas of commercialism, unpleasant social obligation, and working through the holiday. It's important to remember that in \"simpler times\", holidays carried a very different meaning for most folk who celebrated them. Though you can include a grumpy \"bah, humbug\" misanthrope or two in your setting, holidays and festivals are celebrated because they are loved by the masses, and they should be described with as much positive language as you can muster. Even if you have a scrooge or two at your table, you can still draw them into the spirit of the event.",

Feel free to mix-and-match the materials in this book. A local agricultural fair could still host a fun house, set up by the local craftsmen. A circus might still host a strongman contest, to entertain their audience outside of the tent before the show lets in. A holiday celebration might hold a drinking contest or a pie eating contest as part of the practice of communal feasting.

While this guide is primarily written with the Dungeon Master in mind, there are useful player resources to be had within. Chapter 9 focuses on backgrounds, allowing DMs and players alike to construct characters who have lived their lives embedded in the culture of carnivals, circuses, and performing.",
								"There are a million methods of merry-making to be made, and while they can't all be covered in a single book, the hope is that this document will give you enough inspiration to create holidays, festivals, and events that seem to overflow with culture and excitement. Festivals, Feasts & Fairs is not an adventure or a package of pre-made NPCs and dungeons. Instead, it is a collection of resources designed to inspire you. No one knows your players and their needs better than you do, so think about what they would most enjoy out of this book. Have fun!"

Often, this included people who were exceptionally tall or exceptionally short, fat people, people of different ethnicities, or people who suffered some sort of physical deformity. As modern sensitivities have developed, we've accepted that this can be a very harmful mistreatment of people who suffer from disability or deformity, and the practice of paying to view a \"freak\" contributed to their dehumanization.",
								"If you want to keep your carnival setting tasteful, try to avoid classic characters like \"the fat lady\", \"the giant\", \"conjoined twins\" or \"the bearded lady\" (who may not even be out of the ordinary depending on how your setting handles dwarven physiology). Instead focus on performers who actively do things, or capitalize on an appearance that they chose for themselves, such as extreme body modification.

Furthermore, while a Dragonborn may utilize breath weapons, even a fire-breathing sort is not immune to fire, making the supposed \"eating\" of flame still impressive. In reality, what they do requires very little special equipment, but instead a great deal of practice and a slightly more advanced knowledge of the sciences than most people (IE \"heat rises\", \"fire requires oxygen\", and so on)."

Sometimes, the audience member is a \"plant\" (a carnie pretending to be an ordinary commoner) who is in on the gimmick, and knows how to fail spectacularly enough in front of an audience that even a rigged \"feat of strength\" could appear convincing."

The most classic examples may consist of dogs playing leapfrog, lions jumping through hoops, or elephants lifting humanoid gymnastic performers on their trunks. However, in a magical world, these marvelous feats of training might take on entirely different connotations. Druids using Speak With Animals can simply ask a bear to stand up and hold still while they balance a stack of spinning plates on his head. Animal training now becomes more of a matter of making friends and building trust, without having to worry about communicating what you want to a creature that can't understand.",
										"On the other hand, a polymorph spell could simply allow a humanoid who's learned their choreography to appear to be an especially well-trained animal. Keep in mind that, depending on how \"low magic\" or \"high magic\" your setting is, commoners may be considerably more impressed with animal tricks than an adventurer who's aware of such spells might be. If magic is commonplace in your setting, your circus performers may have to pull off considerably more impressive feats of animal training in order to wow their crowds."

When the menagerie comes into town, they'll be able to see all manner of wild creatures that they've only ever heard of in stories.",
										"There's a significant difference between a travelling menagerie and one that is stationary. A single location (sometimes called an animal park or zoological garden) will often make efforts to display animals in environments similar to their native homes. Various feats of magic, technology, or simply importing flora from the animal's place of origin, may be used to accomplish this. Travelling menageries, however, are often limited to placing animals in cages small enough to be transported on wagons.",
										"Whatever form a menagerie takes, it generally is not as ideal as letting animals roam comfortably in their wild homes. For this reason, some people (especially those of the druidic persuasion) may be opposed to the practice of keeping animals captive for the amusement of humanoids. On the other hand, some menageries may fake their exotic display by utilizing magic, ranging from illusions to polymorphed entertainers."

										"Though seeing an exotic animal from afar can be an amazing experience for many common folk, nothing quite beats being able to touch, feed, and pet an animal. However, putting wild animals and untrained people in close proximity to one another can be a dangerous gamble. For this reason, petting zoos often have to strike a balance between wild animals and safe animals. Interestingly enough, petting zoos can be more interesting to noble children than they would be to commoner children. Nobles will have more opportunities to travel and see exotic animals that a commoner would never see, but most commoners will deal with livestock on a relatively regular basis. Thus, a noble child may be enamoured with the opportunity to pet a pig or feed a goat, whereas a child raised on a farm would find nothing special about it."

Originally, mounted soldiers would gallop in circles while tossing balls to one another, forcing them to sharpen their riding skills. The sight of armored knights on horseback was so enthralling to children, that the concept of the carousel was born. At a carousel, horses are tethered to a center post, so that they can only walk in a circular track. The horses may be covered in ornate finery, displaying colorful bridles and barding, and some horses may be ridden by costumed performers to carry on the illusion that children are riding among nobles or knights. Always seeking to stand out from the crowd, some carousel proprietors experiment with other creatures, such as camels, elephants, or riding mastiffs. The creativity of their mounts is limited only by the safety of the wild creatures they're dealing with. Some have also been known to affix fake horns to a horse's ornate head tack, in order to market themselves as having a carousel of unicorns. "

The last competitor to pass out is the winner.",

By the same coin, it will take Gronkna eight drinks before she has to begin making Constitution saves, and take five drinks for Lunalee.

It stands to reason that someone's competitive nature meant an eating contest would be born. Typically, eating contests select a single food item as their focus. Pies are common, as they are made to a uniform size and density. However, any food could be used, ranging from apples, to ears of corn, to giant turkey legs. Judges are always on hand to ensure that the food is fully consumed, and an excess of food is not left behind (pie crust still in the pan, meat left on a bone, etc). Competitors are disqualified if they stand from the table, pass out at the table, or if they throw up. The last competitor still eating, wins. Competitors in a pie eating contest make Constitution saves for each pie they eat, with the DC steadily raising for each pie eaten. If a competitor fails their Constitution save, they are given the \"full\" status. They may continue to compete if they wish, but additional saves will be made with disadvantage. Failing another Constitution save after becoming full, will cause the competitor to vomit (or pass out, if you feel players at your table may be squeamish).",

Extra farm hands may be hired for shearing, and they're paid per-fleece. Thus, competition grew to shear more sheep faster.",

Even people who have never owned pets or been close to animals themselves, tend to feel a distaste for the idea of causing needless harm to an animal, especially if that animal isn't aggressive. Though it would be reasonable to apply a penalty for injuring a sheep in the course of the shearing race, instead, we work off of the assumption that a struggling sheep simply {@i wastes more time}, in the shearer's effort not to cause injury.

Obtaining one's freedom is usually a bloody affair, and requires not only the defeat of slavers, but the overturning of laws and social perceptions that make such oppression possible at its core. An economy built on slave-labor is generally not willing to just give slaves their freedom peacefully, and very often, they've built the mindset that their slaves are \"lesser beings\" that are either undeserving of their freedom, or might be dangerous if freed.",
										"Even a bloodless rebellion will often involve great hardships, such as fleeing over great distances, hiding in dangerous wilderness or climates, and long periods of uncertainty before being able to settle again. Thus, these celebrations can be vitally important for embracing the freedom and peace of mind that one's ancestors were denied.",
										"Celebrating freedom from slavery and oppression is often a mixture of both solemn memorial, and jubilant celebration. Leaders and resistors who fought for their freedom are remembered, as well as mourning for those who died before seeing their people achieve freedom. It is also a time to revel in one's freedom, and showcase cultural practices that were denied to them while in captivity. Many enslaved peoples are stripped of their cultural practices and rights in an effort to demoralize them. This can mean the outlawing of their dances, songs, arts, and even important ceremonies for marriage or child-naming. Thus, celebrations of freedom from slavery may place importance on these nearly-lost parts of one's culture. Some ceremonies may even take on new facets from the ways that they were practiced in secret, such as \"walking around a large tree and greeting one another on the other side\" becoming an important wedding tradition.",
										"When designing a holiday to celebrate freedom from slavery or oppression, remember to think of it from various viewpoints. Why were the formerly-enslaved people singled out (racial or religious differences, defeated in a previous war, etc)? How are the formerly-enslaved peoples treated by their former oppressors? Are formerly-enslaved people still oppressed from an economic standpoint? Do they have true equality, or are they still looked down upon by other groups? Do the former oppressors feel as though they are now the injured or unfairly-treated party in this situation? Also keep in mind that no large group holds all of the same opinions as one another; some descendants of slave-owners may feel remorseful for the actions of their ancestors, while others may prefer to carry on a tradition of hatred.",

In the same light, technological and magical inventions may be celebrated, as well as discovery of new lands or peoples. Though most inventors or discoverers are only known widely in scholarly circles, someone who's inventions benefit common folk may receive public praise. While they may enjoy wealth and attention in their lifetime, or fade into relative obscurity, it's more likely that they will be celebrated with a holiday posthumously.",

								"This holiday is a mixture of Easter celebrations, the idiom of the Golden Goose, and a particular Japanese fairytale! It also utilizes the Swanmay, a classic AD&D race of humanoid women who can transform into birds. Though at the time of this publication the Swanmay have not appeared in D&D since 3.5e, some intrepid writers on the DM's Guild have brought the race into the light of 5th edition. Legend has it that a poor and lonely hunter once found an injured swan at the side of a frozen lake, surrounded by wolves. Running off the wolves, the hunter saved the swan, and brought her to his home where he mended her broken wing and took care of her throughout the winter. Once the swan healed, she flew away in the spring. At the start of the next winter, the hunter was visited by a beautiful woman travelling through the woods near his home. The two fell in love and married. Though the hunter and his bride were happy together, they were very poor. Feeling guilty that he could not provide for his lovely wife, the hunter became depressed. One day, the hunter's wife came out of their chicken coop and handed him a golden egg she'd found, encouraging him to hurry to the nearby town and sell it. The hunter did, and he brought back a sack of money and enough food for them to feast on for days. Time passed, and when the money ran out, the hunter's wife found another golden egg for him to sell. When spring came, the hunter asked his wife which of their chickens was providing golden eggs, but she merely told him not to worry about it, and not to go into the chicken coop when she was tending to the birds. Though the hunter begrudgingly agreed, his curiosity got the better of him one day. When his wife went into the chicken coop, he peered through a crack in the wooden wall. To his shock, he watched his wife transform into a swan, and lay a golden egg. The hunter cried out in surprise, and startled the swan.",
								"The hunter's wife emerged from the chicken coop, sobbing. She admitted to him that she was the swan he had saved the previous winter, and was Princess of the Swanmay. But, now that he knew her secret, she could no longer stay with him. Though her husband tearfully begged for forgiveness, the heartbroken princess turned back into a swan and flew away. Though the tale of love lost and trust broken is an important fable, many folk latch onto more superficial aspects of the story. Every spring, celebrants of the Day Of The Golden Swan go into woods to search for golden (or jeweled) eggs left by theoretical Swanmay royalty. As the story (and possibility of finding treasure) is so enthralling to young children, the holiday is built around entertaining them. Fresh eggs are carefully emptied by poking a small hole in both ends and blowing out the contents. The emptied shells are then decorated in any number of ways. Many households dye them by boiling them with vegetables or berries, and some paint designs on them, or paste pieces of paper to the outside. Adults will hide decorated eggs in the woods near their homes, and then send children out (under watchful supervision) to try to find the hidden eggs. Because the empty egg shells are quite fragile, children are encouraged not to be rambunctious in their hunt. Small prizes or treats are often awarded to the children who find the most (intact) eggs, or who find eggs that were especially cleverly hidden.",

This is often a major undertaking, and in order to protect their herd from illness and misfortune, they will reach out to nearby druid circles to ask for blessings. Understanding the destructive, but also renewing properties of fire, a druid circle pioneered this night-time festival to cleanse a farm house of ill omens and start the summer season fresh. Over time, the festival grew beyond just farmers and their cattle, and now entire towns take part in the celebration.",

One such superstition is that fairies are especially active around the start of summer. Thus, locals will also make visits to locations where fairies are known or suspected to inhabit, to make offerings like milk, berries, flowers, and naturebased treasures like sea shells, uncut jewels, and wooden beads. Because fairies are known for their mischievousness, townsfolk and farmers hope to appease (or at least distract) the fairies during their bonfire rituals.",

Meanwhile, druids or other local spiritual figures construct two large bonfires out in an open field. Under the guidance of the druids and spiritual leaders, cattle are driven between the two flames, believing that the fires will chase away any ills attached to them.",
								"While every town practices it differently, common celebrations include drinking, dancing, sacrificing animals, and/or cooking communal meals on smaller bonfires lit from the two large fires. Jumping over fire pits is also a common activity, practiced by young men or women to show their bravery, or by lovers to show their devotion to one another (\"leaping through fire to be together\"). Once the festivities have ended, every member of the town takes a torch and lights it at one of the two giant bonfires of the festival.

One of the men died when he was thrown from his injured horse and broke his neck, and the winner went on to marry the lady they had both adored. Many years later, the now retired jouster was walking home late at night when he saw a rider on horseback on a hill. The rider was silhouetted before the moon, but he could see that the rider's own head was but the skull of a horse, and his eyes glowed like candles.",
								"Terrified, the man realized he was being haunted by the opponent he had jousted with many years earlier, and he ran home to his wife. Finding his wife at her dressing table, the husband tried to explain in a panic that she needed to hide him. Not knowing what else to do, the woman took one of her dresses and threw it on her husband, before hiding his head with one of her veils. Moments later, the doors burst open with a terrifying screech of a nightmare horse. Husband and wife alike both screamed and cowered. However, not recognizing his rival in disguise, the undead rider left to continue his search elsewhere. They say that every year, even centuries after his rival has died, the undead rider returns to the world of the living in search of revenge. Each time the undead rider crosses over into the world of the living, he brings with him many souls who long to see loved ones they miss, or who crave resolution to unfinished business. Even if these ghosts mean no ill will, their mere presence is a danger to mortals, so living mortals have started a tradition of disguising themselves on the night of Soultide so that those seeking them can't find them.",
								"As the sun goes down on Soultide, anyone brave enough to go outside does so wearing a costume. Originally, crossdressing was the norm, but more creative costumes have come into popularity, such as mummers, adventurers, a variety of masks, or even dressing as ghosts themselves. Nobles began to throw costume parties where they'd gather with friends to eat, have drinks, and tell horror stories; this tradition would eventually make its way to common households as well.",
								"The safety of costumes and the likelihood for many houses to be empty at night, gave way to the tradition of children playing tricks on adults, ranging from minor vandalism to boobytrapped doors and gates. Children began knocking on doors to make certain a home owner was not present before pulling their prank, and if any adult were to answer, the disguised children would demand a small ransom, otherwise they'd pull a trick on the household. Feigning a great fright, many adults acquiesced to the demand, and would give children small pastries, treats, or a few copper coins. This tradition became known as \"trick or treat\".",
								"At midnight, celebrants travel to the nearest body of water (a river, lake, pond, etc), bringing candles and small wooden boats with paper coverings. Removing their masks and disguises by the edge of the water, they light the candles and set the paper lanterns afloat on the water. This act is intended to provide the wandering ghosts of their loved ones with a light to lead them home to the realm of the dead, lest they be trapped in the mortal world for the rest of the year.",

A number of decorative traditions have spawned surrounding Soultide, but they may vary between locales. Recalling the tale of the undead rider who's head was a horse's skull, some houses decorate their doorways or their fireplace mantles with fake humanoid skulls, believing the undead rider will be driven away in jealousy. These skulls, often made of clay or wood, are sometimes painted or decorated with ribbons and flowers to lighten the macabre aesthetic. In households that cannot afford such frivolous decor, it is common for pumpkins or other gourds to be carved with faces, and used in place of skulls."

								"{@i Many origin stories of half-orcs are mired in violence or shrouded in mysticism, but this Thanksgiving-inspired holiday attempts to write a more peaceful and humble beginning to the life of a common half-orc. Though the locale is described as a mountainous region, it could easily be transformed into any other inhospitable terrain that humans and orcs might make an attempt to settle in, such as swamps or deserts}.",
								"A village of half-orcs live in a mountainous region. They tell tales that long ago, a village of humans had settled at the base of their mountain, but they were being preyed upon by bandits and thieves. As the harvest season was coming to an end, the human village feared that they would not have enough supplies to make it through the winter. Little did they know, a tribe of orcs in the mountains above were suffering an equally lean hunting season.",
								"One day, the orcs mounted a raid on the human village, not knowing that they were already besieged by a band of thieves. The orcs frightened the thieves, allowing the villagers to fight back and run the band out of town. The orcs were impressed by the uncharacteristic bravery of the human farmers, and when the humans offered what was left of their harvest to the orcs out of gratitude (or perhaps begging them not to slaughter them too), the orcs were surprised to see how many crops the humans had cultivated in the rocky terrain. Though orcs generally believed other races to be beneath them, the tribe also knew that they were unlikely to survive the coming winter in their current state.",
								"The orcish tribal leader, and the mayor of the small farming town, struck a temporary agreement to share in their resources for the winter. In addition, humans taught orcs their methods of raising livestock and growing crops in the rocky terrain, and orcs in turn taught humans new hunting techniques. By the time spring came, the two groups had formed a tightly knit joint-community.The modern half-orc village still has a few venerable old human men and women who remember what it was like to have orcish neighbors when they were small children, but since orcs seldom live past the age of 45, the orcish traditions are upheld entirely by their half-orc descendants. Every year at the end of the harvest season, they hold a communal feast in the town hall, celebrating the gathering of people together what the locals call, somewhat unimaginatively, Gathering Day.",
								"The day is celebrated with farming contests to see who's cultivated the largest produce or raised the best livestock, as well as archery contests and hunting competitions. Shortly before dinner a customary \"bandit attack\" is carried out by some of the village's teenagers and young adults, who are run off by \"the bravest\" children of the village. In their community, the transition from a child who runs off the bandits, to playing one of the bandits, is considered a marker of when a boy or girl becomes a young man or woman, and coincides with additional privileges and responsibilities they'll take on in the coming seasons.",

								"At first glance, many westerners will recognize this holiday as being analogous to Christmas, but in truth, it's actually patterned after Yuletide. Though the Feast Of The Wild Hunt not associated with any specific religious figures in this iteration, you're welcome to make modifications to bring it closer to the base of Christmas or Yuletide if you prefer. If you're using a calendar that is analogous to the western calendar, the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will begin on the 20th day of the 12th month, and end on the 31st, meaning it will coincide with any potential New Year's Eve celebrations. An \"either-or\" approach is recommended, as stacking holidays or placing a New Year's Day holiday immediately after this 12day feast will be excessive and/or exhausting.",
								"This twelve-day festival begins on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and celebrates the tradition that a party of ghostly (or perhaps divine) hunters rides through the woods in search of great prey during this season. It is believed that this \"wild hunt\" also sweeps up all of the remnants of dead souls of the year and brings them along as servants on the hunt, ending times of mourning. The wild hunt serves an important purpose, bringing a close to the end of the year and starting anew.",
								"It is customary that no work is done during the twelve day festival; while this does not mean that every business closes (healers, inns, and general stores often stay open in at least a limited capacity), people hurry to get many jobs finished before the festival, such as cutting wood, works of crafting, sewing, etc. Some believe that disaster awaits those who have not completed their work before the festival, and they may even be swept up along with the dead souls and taken by the wild hunt. The Feast Of The Wild Hunt makes for a busy travelling season, as celebrants will often try to return to their family home to celebrate. Though arriving by sunset on the first day of the festival is ideal, work obligations and heavily snowed-in roads make this a difficult proposition for many. As such, visitors tend to trickle in during all twelve days of the feast. Some households who don't have extended family or aren't expecting guests will open their doors to travellers during the season, providing shelter for those who haven't yet completed their journeys. Though all twelve days are considered part of the holiday, four days in particular have noteworthy customs.",

On this day, it is customary for households to gift their friends and loved ones with logs for their hearths, to keep them burning for all twelve days of the festival. Very large and dry logs are prized gifts, and may be kept and prepared for months before the Feast Of The Wild Hunt. Many people will also keep bundles of small dry sticks and twigs tied with cord (often gathered by the household's children) to give as gifts to acquaintances. Roadside vendors will sell bundles of split firewood decorated with ribbons, holly, mistletoe, and pine needles to be purchased for gifting when travellers return home as guests. This is considered a time for welcoming guests, and households will often bake fresh bread or keep pots of spiced cider over their fires, letting the welcoming scents of the season waft out to draw their travellers home."

Any oaths made on this night are considered of the utmost importance, and for this reason, many people will propose marriage during this last night of celebration.
