The discovery that she could shapeshift came in her early teens when she fell in love with a human girl named Julia.",

One day a drunk visitor followed the two girls as they explored, hoping to rob them. Alyssa somehow knew his intentions and told Julia to run.",
					"Alyssa stood fast as the man demanded her necklace. It was precious to her\u2014it had once belonged to her mother. She was furious that he would demand something that wasn't his. Her mind was a storm of anger and fear; she feared for hers and Julia's safety.",

He stumbled, hitting his head on a rock. He didn't move and Alyssa ran home. As she ran, she realized her body had changed. On arriving home, a mirror in her room shared the truth. She fell asleep cowering in a corner, trying desperately to stay in control.",
					"Later that night she awoke to loud banging. A glance in the mirror revealed her normal appearance. Her father, Vanovar, opened the front door to a visitor, who claimed Lorimar was dead at the hands of bandits. The bandits had attacked Lorimar, claiming he had killed one of their own. Though Lorimar denied he had done this, they refused to listen and killed him.",

The visitor said he was from Thay and had lost someone dear to him as well to these thugs. He promised Vanovar and Alyssa that he would hunt the bandits down and make them pay for what they had done.",

					"When Myth Drannor was first constructed, Lossarwyn was a powerful elf druid who viewed the spread of humanity as an evil taint upon Faerûn. He traveled the Realms seeking out places afflicted with the plague, where his vast knowledge and medical expertise helped save many lives. Secretly, his true aim was not to cure the sick, but to find a virulent plague that would cleanse the land of humanity.",
					"After years of research he appeared to be nearing a breakthrough that would create a deadly disease, finally eradicating humankind. However, a jealous rival discovered his secret and Lossarwyn was forced to flee from a trio of powerful druids who sought to end his madness. His pursuers finally trapped Lossarwyn within the icy caverns of a glacier. After a terrible battle, they killed Lossarwyn trapping him beneath impenetrable ice. Before Lossarwyn died, he whispered a dread pact with fiendish forces and was transformed into an undead creature.",
					"Centuries later, Lossarwyn was freed from his icy prison within the glacier. He continued his quest to find the plague. After joining with an evil cabal of wizards, they too discovered his secret, and though they could not defeat the elvish lich, they trapped him within the confines of the Dire Wood, free to travel within, but never to escape to the rest of Faerûn.",
					"Recently, members of Eldreth Veluuthra discovered the lich's location. After much effort, they succeeded in circumventing the arcane protections trapping the lich by having him travel through the Abyss to arrive within one of the many demoncysts buried beneath the Great Dale. Though Lossarwyn still cannot set foot within Faerûn outside of the Dire Wood, he is free to travel to any of the demoncysts under the ancient lands of Narfell. Lossarwyn is now invigorated and working feverishly with the Eldreth Veluuthra to create the disease that has eluded him for so long."

The First Ring is growing concerned with the increased frequency of these meditations and the Nentyarch's refusal to discuss any insights gained from them.",

When the priesthood refused to take a forceful stand against outlaws pillaging farming villages along the Great Road, Veshlova took the matter into her own hands: using her familiarity with poisonous fungi from the Forest of Lethyr, she concocted a lethal poison. Concealing the poison inside richly flavored almond cookies, she offered them to the leader of the bandits, and in doing so assassinated the entire clan. While this act brought peace to her people, the priesthood of Mielikki swiftly disowned her for the vile act; she lost her divine gifts. However, her decisive and ruthless actions attracted the attention of Talona, the Goddess of Poison and Disease, who offered her divine power and, more importantly, the free will to make her own choices, without fear of being abandoned by her goddess. Veshlova happily accepted the offer, becoming a Chosen of Talona.",

Despite Veshlova's good intentions, the seductive power of the Lady of Poison pulls her slowly towards darkness. Through the years, her actions have grown increasingly bold, and she has begun to form alliances with powerful figures outside of the Great Dale, who seek to influence the future of the region. While some have noble goals, others would just as happily see the region fall into chaos."

					"Vosthor was a hagspawn, a rare and unfortunate male progeny of a hag. He was an imperious wizard lord who ruled over Mettledale. The hagspawn was an oppressive ruler for many years until the Year of the Sceptered One (1404 DR) when the hero of Spearsmouth Dale, Lord Abraer Thellblade, arrived with his companions to dispose of the tyrant. Unfortunately for Lord Abraer, he woefully underestimated Vosthor and his collection of ruffians. In the course of a tenday, the hagspawn had killed Lord Abraer and gained control of Spearsmouth Dale as well.",
					"Vosthor was careful to avoid offending the Circle of Leth and thus ruled both dales with an iron fist for decades until his fear of mortality changed his focus. Seeking ways to extend his existence, he became a follower of Orcus, hoping to learn the secret to surviving as an undead being. The demon lord was happy to gain a new powerful thrall and transformed Vosthor into an undead creature under his control.",
					"Once transformed, Vosthor retreated from public view, handing control of Spearsmouth Dale and Mettledale to one of his bugbear lieutenants. Seeking long-term stability, Vosthor directed his lieutenants to ally themselves with the Shadowmasters of Telflamm. The criminal organization was happy to oblige, and have helped the hagspawn control the region in the years since.",
					"Behind the scenes, Vosthor now follows the directions of Orcus and seeks to set up new cults to the Lord of Undeath across Thesk and the Great Dale. Orcus would like nothing more than to utterly eliminate the Demon Lord Eltab, who is currently trapped in Eastern Faerûn. He may direct Vosthor to seek out powerful heroes, warn them of the dangers Eltab presents to the region, and guide them in their task in destroying one of Orcus's rivals."

				"Ndulu, a balor in the service of Orcus, spent a half century hunting down each of the crown-wraiths that had escaped from the broken crown. Ndulu channeled the Prince of Undeath's fiendish power to forge the Moaning Crown of Ndulu from these wraiths.",
				"The crown appears as a roiling cloud of black smoke resting atop its wearer. Close inspection reveals occasional glimpses of the tortured faces of those bound within.",
				"{@b Ethereal Form.} The crown is ethereal and can only be affected or handled by effects or creatures that extend to the Ethereal Plane.",
				"{@b Deathly Taint.} Anyone touching the ethereal form of the Moaning Crown of Ndulu is embraced by the wraiths bound within. For each turn that you touch the crown, you take 21 ({@damage 4d8 + 3}) necrotic damage. Every time you take damage, you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have your hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You die if this effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0 and your spirit is absorbed into the crown.",
				"{@b Evil Moan.} The wraiths bound within the crown emit a continuous evil moan. While your are attuned to the crown, any non-evil creature within a 15-foot radius of you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the frightened creature has line of sight to the crown, then it has disadvantage on saving throws to end this effect. If the creature succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, they are immune to the crown's Evil Moan feature for the next 24 hours.",
				"{@b Terrifying Scream.} You may use an action to invoke a soul-rending scream from the crown. Constructs and undead are immune to this feature. All other creatures within 30 feet who can hear this scream must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage. Once used, you cannot again use this feature again until you finish a long rest.",
				"{@b Sentience.} The Moaning Crown of Ndulu possesses a communal intelligence forged from the wraiths that make up the ethereal crown. It is chaotic evil and has an Intelligence of 16, Wisdom of 14, and Charisma of 15.",
				"While attuned to this item, you can hear these wraiths speak to you, while all other creatures only hear the susurrus of their moaning.",
				"{@b Personality.} The wraiths trapped in the crown yearn to break free of their imprisonment. They despise all people of faith, particularly followers of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater. They have a special hatred for paladins devoted to these deities."

Also, because of the sword's massive size, it deals {@damage 2d8} points of damage on a hit, instead of a greatsword's normal damage. On a successful hit, the target and up to two other creatures of your choice within 15 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier, or take 5 ({@damage 1d10}) points of lightning damage. Attacks with Stormsplitter score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20."

They are typically small wooden boats that can hold three to four people (as per a rowboat), though larger warboats (equivalent to longships) are known to exist as well. These boats are crafted by Rashemani spellcasters who call upon the spirits of the land to enchant the watercraft. No working versions of these vessels have been seen outside of Rashemen.",
