Sie sind in der Lage, selbst die obskursten Informationsquellen aufzuspüren, und dienen den Archivaren als unschätzbare Verbündete. Wenn sie sich bedroht fühlen, falten sie sich zu phantastischen Bestien zusammen und fliegen hoch in die Luft.

Der Schallplattenjäger wird sich selbst entfalten und die unzähligen Schichten und Seiten in seinem Körper offenbaren, die alle mit den Geheimnissen bedeckt sind, die er enthüllt hat. Dann fängt er an, sich selbst zu zerreißen, und windet sich lautlos im Todeskampf, während er sich zu einem Buch oder einer Schriftrolle zusammenfügt.",

Auf diese Weise wächst und breitet sich das Verfluchte Archiv aus und sucht ständig nach neuen Archivaren, die seine Aufzeichnungsjäger weiterführen. Der Stumme handelt trotz dieser seltsamen Konstrukte, indem er das Wissen des Archivs bewahrt und gleichzeitig so handelt, dass künftige Ergänzungen der Sammlung verhindert werden. Sobald sich ein schriftliches Werk im Archiv befindet, kann es nicht mehr zerstört werden.",

Das Feuer brennt schnell, und wenn es nur noch aus Kohlen besteht, nimmt das Glutgeborene Gestalt an. Er wird aus dem Feuer auftauchen und nach Nahrung verlangen. Wenn der Beschwörer der neugeborenen Bestie ohne zu zögern einen Tropfen seines Blutes gibt, wird das Glutgeborene lächeln und seinem neuen Herrn Treue schwören. Wenn der Beschwörer dies nicht tut, wird sich das Glutgeborene in Rauch auflösen und einen Wald suchen, den es anzünden kann."

Sie werden als Diener und Spione von Hexenmeistern des Grauen Porträts und anderen geschickten Handwerkern und Kunsthandwerkern geschaffen, die im Namen ihrer Kunst Blut vergießen. Diese Bilder sind boshaft und grausam, sie verhöhnen ehemalige Freunde, damit sie sich gegenseitig verletzen, und machen unhöfliche Gesten, um zu amüsieren und zu beleidigen. Die meisten sind menschenähnlich, aber einige zeigen fantastische Tiere, imaginäre Bestien und sogar Landschaften oder Szenerien.

					"Die Schaffung eines lebenden Bildes ist eine ungewöhnliche Sache, die direkt mit der Kunst des Schattenspiels verbunden ist. Die Bilder können zwar jede Farbe und Form haben, sind aber bei ihrer ersten Entstehung sehr einfach. Der Künstler muss sich vor ein brennendes Feuer stellen und eine eldritische Verbindung mit der Flamme herstellen, um sie aufzufordern, mehr Licht zu spenden. Danach legt er seine Hände auf die andere Seite des Feuers und wirft einen Schatten an die Wand oder auf den Boden. Während sie die für diesen mystischen Ritus erforderlichen schaurigen Worte und Sätze singen, formen sie mit ihren Händen eine Schattenpuppe. Die Gesänge sind mit einer Geschichte verbunden, die zu der Persönlichkeit des lebendigen Bildes passt, das sie beschwören wollen.",
					"Eine Geschichte von Verlust und Verrat wird ein Bild hervorrufen, das die Gestalt von Monstern und Mördern annimmt, während eine angenehme Geschichte mit glücklichem Ausgang ein Bild hervorbringen wird, das eher schelmisch als hasserfüllt ist. Im Laufe des Rituals verfestigt sich die Schattenpuppe und bewegt sich nicht mehr mit den Händen des Künstlers. Am Ende des Rituals schneidet der Hexenmeister eine Fingerspitze ab und gibt einen einzigen Tropfen Blut auf den Schatten, um ihn mit Leben, Seele und Gehorsam gegenüber seinem Schöpfer zu erfüllen."

Hexenmeister, die sich auf die Schattenkatze eingeschworen haben, nehmen sie oft als Vertraute an und behandeln die Dimcat in der Regel als eine Erweiterung ihres Gönners. In gewissem Sinne sind sie das auch: Jede Dimcat ist ein Abbild der Schattenkatze, die entstand, als dieses rätselhafte Wesen einen geringeren Albtraum verzehrte und umwandelte und den alten Schrecken in eine neue Form mit einem neuen Zweck verwandelte.",

Sie haben eine interessante Rivalität mit den Archivjägern und versuchen, ihre Geheimnisse davor zu bewahren, auf so profane Weise wie in der Literatur katalogisiert zu werden. Stattdessen halten sie mündliche Überlieferungen für die höchste Form des Wissens und versuchen, sie in ihren Träumen, die sie in Vollmondnächten besuchen, weiterzugeben.",

Mit diesen rief er die Meere auf, sich über das Land zu erheben und den gesamten Planeten zu verschlingen, wobei die Artefakte jedoch zerstört wurden. Unzählige Tausende starben an diesem Tag, und die Übriggebliebenen lebten zwischen den Leichen und der Brandung inmitten der höchsten Berggipfel. Mit der Zeit wurde der unerschütterliche Einfluss der Hüter auf die Welt immer größer und verwandelte die einst edlen Menschen in Imitationen ihrer selbst. Sie führten Rituale an den Toten durch, nahmen das Fleisch ihrer Gefallenen und verzehrten es selbst. Sie opferten dem Hüter ihre gebrochenen Körper und Seelen, und er wurde immer mächtiger.",
					"Schließlich entdeckte er, dass es ihm gefiel, das Geflüster derer zu hören, die ihn verehrten, und so wandte er sich den verlorenen und uralten Künsten zu, die es erlaubten, aus Fleisch Leben und aus Träumen Gefühl zu formen. So wurden die augenlosen Wächter geboren, die zur Unterhaltung ihres unmenschlichen Meisters für immer die Geheimnisse derer flüstern, die gekommen und gegangen sind."

Wenn sie sich im Sturzflug auf ihre Beute stürzen, frieren sie die Ränder ihrer Flügel ein und schlagen mit den eisbeschichteten Federn zu, wobei der Frost in der Wunde zurückbleibt und ihr Opfer verlangsamt.

Bevor die Beute reagieren kann, stürzt sich der zweite mit der Wucht eines Blitzes auf das Tier und tötet es auf der Stelle. Dann hocken die beiden auf dem Körper, bis der Schnee ihm die Wärme entzogen hat, und beginnen ihr Festmahl, wenn das Blut zu gefrieren beginnt.",

Sie haben eine starke Bindung zu den anderen Tieren im Stall des Jägers, sind jedoch hochmütig und betrachten sich selbst als die bevorzugten Tiere. Die Rösser mögen die Zuneigung ihres Herrn genießen, aber die Falken waren die Ersten, und die Falken werden die Letzten sein. Ihr Stolz verleitet sie zu scheinbar unmöglichen Heldentaten, bei denen sie Zauberern die Augen ausreißen und sich in den Rachen von Drachen stürzen, um sie mit ihren rasiermesserscharfen Flügeln zu spalten."

Diese Kobras entstammen einem langen Stammbaum, der sie zu Spionen, Attentätern und Assistenten der Höflinge gezüchtet hat, und sind bösartig und hinterhältig. Ihr Gift ist stark und mit mächtiger Magie durchdrungen, so dass es selbst diejenigen verletzen kann, die gegen solche Gifte geschützt sind. Wenn sie ruhen, suchen sie sich kleine Tiere wie Ratten oder Vögel und quälen sie zur Unterhaltung, wobei sie nach und nach kleine Mengen Gift injizieren, bis die Kreatur unter schrecklichen Qualen stirbt. Diese Kobras erfreuen sich an Schmeicheleien sowie Witz- und Glücksspielen und nehmen gerne Geschenke in Form von kostbaren Edelsteinen, Schmuck, Spiegeln, exotischem Fleisch und Eiern von Reptilien und Vögeln gleichermaßen an. Die richtigen Beschwörungsformeln und Sprüche sind ohne gespaltene Zunge nur schwer auszusprechen, und so wird es nur selten von jemandem durchgeführt, der nicht Diener der Kaiserin ist. Im Verlauf des Rituals muss der Beschwörer ein kleines, zahnförmiges Zeichen in seine Hand einritzen, bevor er sie über das Feuer eines Kohlenbeckens hält und sie der Kobra opfert. Die Bestie wird aus dem Feuer hervorkommen, zunächst als Schlange mit grünen Flammen, die sich in böser Absicht windet und zischt. Die flammende Schlange schlägt nach der dargebotenen Hand und brennt eine dünne Linie durch den eingravierten Reißzahn. Wenn der Beschwörer während dieses Vorgangs ruhig und gelassen bleibt, wird er den Ritus erfolgreich vollziehen und der Schlange Leben einhauchen, so dass sie körperlich wird. Zeigt der Beschwörer Emotionen oder Schmerz, fließt ein quälendes Gift durch seine Adern und das Ritual wird abgebrochen.",
					"Die meisten Diener der Kaiserin schenken der kaiserlichen Kobra eine Art Erkennungsschmuck, damit sie ihre Überlegenheit gegenüber allen niederen Kreaturen deutlicher zum Ausdruck bringen kann. Sie dient ihrem Herrn als Ebenbürtige, die sich nur aufgrund der Magie, die sie bindet, ihren Wünschen unterwirft, und nicht aus echter Loyalität. Der Schwur einer Schlange bedeutet wenig, es sei denn, er wird gegenüber dem Herrscher des Endlosen Reiches geleistet."

Diese Scherben erscheinen als kleine gesichtslose Statuen, die der Geliebten vage ähneln, und werden als Erinnerung an das grimmige Ziel gegeben, das die Diener dieses gefallenen Sterns antreibt. Sie leuchten mit strahlender Macht in der Dunkelheit der Nacht und vertreiben die Schatten, die die verlorenen Artefakte und Rituale verbergen würden, die sie zur Erfüllung ihrer Aufgabe benötigen. Diese Scherben sind zielstrebig in ihrer Suche und lassen sich von keiner Gefahr abbringen. Wenn ihr Schützling bedroht ist, opfern sie sich bereitwillig, wie es der Verbannte getan hat, und versuchen, ihren gefallenen Kameraden zu retten, selbst wenn es sie das eigene Leben kostet. Sie tragen jedoch immer noch den Funken der Verachtung für die Sterblichkeit in sich, den ihr Vorgänger einst besaß, und schlagen mit bösartigem Licht zu, wenn sie den Fall eines sterblichen Feindes miterleben. Die Beschwörung eines Leuchtsplitters ist im Vergleich zu einigen anderen Vertrauten recht einfach. Man muss sich einfach vor das Feuer stellen, es entzünden und leidenschaftlich über etwas sprechen, das man sich wünscht oder das man verloren hat. Die Flammenzungen beginnen in einem warmen Blau und Gold zu brennen, während sie sich zu einer humanoiden Gestalt zusammenfügen. Der Beschwörer muss dem winzigen Wesen dann sanft die Hand reichen und ihm aus dem Kohlenbecken helfen. Beim Austritt wird es zu einem leuchtenden Splitter erstarren. Der Beschwörer muss dann seine Lebensaufgabe erklären, so wie er sie in diesem Moment sieht. Ist er wahrheitsgemäß, schwört der Splitter in einer Reihe von Gesten Loyalität und dient fortan als Vertrauter. Wenn sie trügerisch sind, wird der Splitter eine Träne aus geschmolzenem Kristall vergießen, in Fragmente zerspringen und sich dem Verbannten in den Himmeln wieder anschließen."

					"Der symphonische Singvogel ist ein farbenfrohes Vogelwesen, das die Stimmen anderer nachahmt und eine wunderschöne Melodie für jede Gelegenheit erzeugen kann. Sie scheinen von Vögeln abstammen, die der Anziehungskraft des Perfekten Akkords erlegen sind und von den magischen Emanationen, die ständig von ihm ausgehen, berührt wurden. Durchdrungen von chorischer Kraft, sprechen und singen sie mit den Stimmen aller Klänge, die sie gehört haben. Seltsamerweise scheinen sie es vorzuziehen, im Ruhezustand einem ständigen Geräuschansturm ausgesetzt zu sein, und suchen sich den lautesten Ort in der Umgebung, um ihre Nester zu bauen.",
					"Kolonien von Singvögeln bilden ganze Orchestersymphonien, zur Freude der wenigen, denen eine Audienz gewährt wird. Wenn sie sich bedroht fühlen, schlagen sie mit ihren bösen Schnäbeln zu und spornen sich gegenseitig an, mit Inbrunst und Wut gegen alle Angreifer zu kämpfen. Sie freuen sich über Geschenke in Form von Früchten und glänzenden Gegenständen, die sie zum Bau kunstvoller Nester verwenden. Ihre Gesänge sind jedoch dafür bekannt, dass sie Reisende in die Irre führen, und sie werden von den Menschen in weniger zivilisierten Ländern oft mit Misstrauen und Argwohn betrachtet. Um einen symphonischen Singvogel zu beschwören, muss man, wie zu erwarten, singen. Das Feuer wird angezündet, der Weihrauch verbrannt, und der Beschwörer muss eine von ihm selbst kreierte Melodie anstimmen. Das muss sorgfältig geschehen, damit ein anderer ohne Unterbrechung oder Störung harmonieren kann, und ist für Neulinge oft schwierig. Sobald das Lied den richtigen Moment erreicht hat, verwandelt sich das Feuer in der Feuerschale in das Bild eines Singvogels, der dann mit seinem neuen Meister zu singen beginnt. Der Beschwörer muss seinen Gesang bis zu einem angemessenen Ende fortsetzen und gleichzeitig den Vogel aus dem Feuerbecken herausführen. Sobald der Vogel vollständig aufgetaucht ist und seine Körperlichkeit angenommen hat, muss der Hexenmeister das Lied beenden und seinen Namen aussprechen. Der symphonische Singvogel wird den Namen perfekt wiederholen und dann seinen eigenen aussprechen. Wenn der Hexenmeister das Gleiche tut und den Namen des Singvogels in exakter Nachahmung ausspricht, wird das Band zwischen Vertrautem und Meister geknüpft."

					"Geld ist eine tödliche Sache, die in den Taschen zahlloser Heiliger und Schurken gleichermaßen lauert, ein Werkzeug, das sowohl Heil als auch Elend bringt. Doch nicht allen Geldern kann man trauen. Die Währungs-Verschwörung hat die ursprünglichen Währungen der Welt allmählich durch Karensee ersetzt, die umgangssprachlich als Wohlstandsimitatoren bezeichnet werden. Sie können unendlich viele Formen annehmen, aber im Gegensatz zu ihren größeren Verwandten sind sie eingeschränkt. Diese Nachahmer können sich nur in Gegenstände verwandeln, die einen Wert zu haben scheinen. Eine Goldmünze, ein Geldschein, ein Edelstein, eine Perlenkette: All diese Dinge sind potenzielle Reichtumsmimiken. Die meisten von ihnen schlafen und sind in einer einzigen Form gefangen. Während sie schlafen, täuschen sie Schäden oder andere Krankheiten vor und verhalten sich genau wie natürliche Materialien. Wenn sie jedoch durch eldritische Magie geweckt werden, erwachen sie zum Leben und greifen diejenigen an, die sie besitzen wollten. Mitglieder der Währungsverschwörung rufen und erwecken die Reichtumsmimiker oft mit einem rituellen Ritus, aber jeder Hexenmeister mit ausreichender Macht und Wissen kann sie beschwören.",
					"Die ersten Schritte sind relativ einfach. Der Beschwörer muss das Feuer entfachen, sich daneben stellen und die richtigen Beschwörungsformeln sprechen. Sobald das Feuer bis auf die Glut heruntergebrannt ist, muss der Beschwörer einen einzelnen Wertgegenstand einlegen, den ein Reichtumsnachahmer nachahmen könnte, z. B. eine Münze oder einen Geldschein.",
					"Als nächstes muss der Hexenmeister Blut opfern. Wenn er ein paar Tropfen auf den Gegenstand in der Feuerschale gibt, werden die Flammen erneut auflodern, den Gegenstand verzehren und dann verschwinden. Die Asche beginnt sich zu einer Form zusammenzufügen, die mit der des Objekts identisch ist, und ein neues Reichtumsimitat wird geboren. Sie spricht ein einziges Wort und gibt sich selbst einen Namen. Solange dieser Name seinem Meister bekannt ist, wird es perfekt gehorchen, seine Form verändern und auf Befehl töten.",
					"Wohlstandsmimiker lassen sich gerne mit anderen Währungen füttern. Einige Gelehrte flüstern, dass dies dazu dient, ihnen Macht zu verleihen, andere vermuten, dass sie einfach von Natur aus kannibalistisch sind. Es wird angenommen, dass die Mitglieder der Verschwörung die Vermögensnachahmer mit einer eingebauten Sicherheitsmaßnahme geschaffen haben, für den Fall, dass bei dem endgültigen Plan etwas schief geht. In diesem Fall würden sie sich gegenseitig in einem Rausch verzehren, nachdem ihnen anderes Fleisch vorenthalten wurde, so dass sie für diejenigen, die sie nicht erreichen konnten, unschädlich wären."
