						"In vielerlei Hinsicht ist ein auf diese Weise erstellter tierischer Begleiter ein Mittelding zwischen einem normalen tierischen Begleiter des Waldl√§ufers, einem Vertrauten und einem Spielercharakter.",
						"Die Erstellung eines tierischen Begleiters besteht aus vier einfachen Schritten. Der erste Schritt besteht darin, die Art der Kreatur zu bestimmen, der der Begleiter nachgebildet werden soll. Als N√§chstes w√§hlt der Charakter, der den Begleiter erschafft, seine Herkunft aus. Die Herkunft bestimmt, um welche Art von Kreatur es sich handelt und umfasst fast alle im Monsterhandbuch vorgestellten Typen. Dies ist vergleichbar mit der Auswahl einer Rasse f√ºr einen Spielercharakter. Der dritte Schritt besteht darin, den Archetyp des Begleiters aus den angebotenen Optionen auszuw√§hlen. Archetypen sind wie die gleichnamige F√§higkeit einer Klasse, bestimmen aber den Gro√üteil der F√§higkeitspunkte des Begleiters, seine R√ºstungsklasse, seinen Trefferw√ºrfel und alle besonderen F√§higkeiten, die er besitzen k√∂nnte. Schlie√ülich bestimmt der Dungeon Master das Temperament des Begleiters.",
						"Die Einzelheiten der Erstellung eines Tierbegleiters werden sp√§ter in diesem Abschnitt ausf√ºhrlich erkl√§rt. Sie erhalten Stufen wie ein Spielercharakter, k√∂nnen aber keine Mehrfachklassen bilden, haben einen niedrigeren Fertigkeitsbonus und sind schw√§cher als ein echter Spielercharakter, aber nicht so schwach wie ein normaler Tiergef√§hrte.",
						"Mechanisch gesehen gehorcht der Begleiter den Befehlen seines Meisters so gut er kann. Er w√ºrfelt f√ºr die Initiative wie jede andere Kreatur, aber der Dungeon Master bestimmt seine Handlungen, Entscheidungen, Haltungen und so weiter. Wenn der Gef√§hrte seinem Meister vertraut und ihn respektiert, werden seine Handlungen im Kampf vom Spielercharakter oder der Gruppe als Ganzes kontrolliert.",

Es ist vielleicht noch nicht ganz ausgereift, aber selbst ein junger Hund ist in der Lage, sich in kurzer Zeit zu verteidigen.",
								"Solange sich ein tierischer Begleiter in der Entwicklungsphase befindet, zieht er die Flucht dem Kampf vor und bleibt in der N√§he seines Herrn. Es erwartet, dass es besch√ºtzt und aufgezogen wird, w√§hrend es heranw√§chst, und auch wenn es noch seinem Temperament entsprechend handelt, ist es doch dem normalen √úberlebensinstinkt verpflichtet. Diese Kreaturen wissen, dass sie nicht stark genug sind, um es mit einem gew√∂hnlichen Goblin oder Kobold aufzunehmen, solange sie noch nicht erwachsen sind."

If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master.

With these, it called the seas to rise above the land and swallow the entire planet, though the artifacts were destroyed in the process. Countless thousands died that day, and those that remained lived among the corpses and the surf amidst the highest mountaintops. Over time, the Keeper's unshakable influence over the world grew ever greater, twisting once noble folk into imitations of themselves. They performed rituals over the dead, taking the flesh of their fallen and consuming it themselves. They offered their broken bodies and minds to the Keeper, and it grew ever more powerful.",

Then the two will perch upon the body until the snow has taken the heat from it, beginning their feast when the blood begins to freeze.",

The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master's affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings."

					"The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang. If the summoner remains calm and still through this process, they will succeed in the rite, gifting the serpent with life and causing it to become corporeal. If they express emotion or pain, then an agonizing toxin will flood their veins and the ritual will be disrupted.",
					"Most servants of the Empress will offer the imperial cobra some form of identifying jewelry, so that it may more clearly express its superiority over all lesser creatures. It serves its master as an equal, subservient only to their wishes by the fact of the magic binding them rather than any true loyalty. The oath of a snake means little, except when it is made to the ruler of the Endless Empire."

They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe. Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment. If they are truthful, then the shard will swear loyalty in a series of gestures and serve faithfully as a familiar from then on. If they are deceptive, then the shard will shed a tear of molten crystal, shatter into fragments, and rejoin the Exile in the skies above."

Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. Summoning a symphonic songbird involves singing, as one might expect. The brazier is lit, the incense is burned, and the summoner must begin a melody of their own creation. It must be carefully done, so that there is room for another to harmonize without interruption or disruption, and is often difficult for novices. Once the song reaches the correct moment, the fire within the brazier will coalesce into the image of a songbird, and it will begin to sing along with its new master. The summoner must continue their song to an appropriate closing, guiding the bird out from the brazier at the same time. Once it has emerged fully and is corporeal, the warlock must end the song and speak their name. The symphonic songbird will repeat the name perfectly, and then speak its own. When the warlock does the same and speaks the songbird's name in exact mimicry, the bond between familiar and master will be formed."

					"A deadly thing that lurks in the pockets of countless saints and villains alike, money is a tool that brings both salvation and misery. Not all funds can be trusted, however. The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.",
					"The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.",
					"Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.",
					"Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach."

						"In vielerlei Hinsicht ist ein auf diese Weise erstellter tierischer Begleiter ein Mittelding zwischen einem normalen tierischen Begleiter des Waldl√§ufers, einem Vertrauten und einem Spielercharakter.",

Als N√§chstes w√§hlt der Charakter, der den Begleiter erschafft, seine Herkunft aus. Die Herkunft bestimmt, um welche Art von Kreatur es sich handelt und umfasst fast alle im Monsterhandbuch vorgestellten Typen. Dies ist vergleichbar mit der Auswahl einer Rasse f√ºr einen Spielercharakter. Der dritte Schritt besteht darin, den Archetyp des Begleiters aus den angebotenen Optionen auszuw√§hlen. Archetypen sind wie die gleichnamige F√§higkeit einer Klasse, bestimmen aber den Gro√üteil der F√§higkeitspunkte des Begleiters, seine R√ºstungsklasse, seinen Trefferw√ºrfel und alle besonderen F√§higkeiten, die er besitzen k√∂nnte. Schlie√ülich bestimmt der Dungeon Master das Temperament des Begleiters.",
						"Die Einzelheiten der Erstellung eines Tierbegleiters werden sp√§ter in diesem Abschnitt ausf√ºhrlich erkl√§rt. Sie erhalten Stufen wie ein Spielercharakter, k√∂nnen aber keine Mehrfachklassen bilden, haben einen niedrigeren Fertigkeitsbonus und sind schw√§cher als ein echter Spielercharakter, aber nicht so schwach wie ein normaler Tiergef√§hrte.",
						"Mechanisch gesehen gehorcht der Begleiter den Befehlen seines Meisters so gut er kann. Er w√ºrfelt f√ºr die Initiative wie jede andere Kreatur, aber der Dungeon Master bestimmt seine Handlungen, Entscheidungen, Haltungen und so weiter. Wenn der Gef√§hrte seinem Meister vertraut und ihn respektiert, werden seine Handlungen im Kampf vom Spielercharakter oder der Gruppe als Ganzes kontrolliert.",

Es erwartet, dass es besch√ºtzt und aufgezogen wird, w√§hrend es heranw√§chst, und auch wenn es noch seinem Temperament entsprechend handelt, ist es doch dem normalen √úberlebensinstinkt verpflichtet.
