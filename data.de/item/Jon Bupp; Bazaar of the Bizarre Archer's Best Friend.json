This bonus is also gained when attempting a trick shot, as long as that shot is not intended to directly harm another character or creature. In other words, the +5 bonus applies to an attempt to shoot an apple off another character's head, hitting an opponent's weapon, or any similar shot.",

The arrows vanish with no effect if they miss their intended target. The phantom bow fires 1d20 + 40 of these arrows, after which point the bow vanishes. Normal and magical arrows can also be fired from this weapon, but magical arrows gain no additional attack bonus. Each normal arrow fired from the bow gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, these arrows can be fired without detracting from the bow's longevity (i.e., the bow's magic is not decreased by firing normal arrows).",
