Solange du auf den Anhänger eingestimmt bist, hast du Resistenz gegen Kälteschaden. Außerdem verströmt der Anhänger eine Aura der Fröhlichkeit und ermöglicht es dir, den Zaubertrick {@spell friends} nach Belieben zu wirken. Die Schneeflocke enthält 8 Ladungen und erhält jeden Tag bei Sonnenaufgang {@dice 1d6 + 2} verbrauchte Ladungen zurück. Während du die Schneeflocke trägst, kannst du einen Teil ihrer Ladungen aufbrauchen, um entweder {@spell hypnotic pattern|PHB} (3 Ladungen) oder {@spell Snilloc's snowball swarm|XGE} (2 Ladungen) zu wirken, wobei du entweder deinen Zauberschutz-DC oder den DC des Gegenstands von 15 verwendest, je nachdem, welcher Wert höher ist.",

Er hatte die letzten fünf Tage daran gearbeitet, sich zurückgezogen und sein feuriges Tieflingsblut den kalten, tosenden Winden der winterlichen Natur ausgesetzt.

Vorsichtig hob sie das kristalline Amulett aus der Schatulle, seine Form schimmerte und formte sich langsam zu einem fraktalen Kaleidoskop von Mustern. Ein Prisma aus himmlischen Farben tanzte auf dem Tisch, während der glitzernde Schneeflocken-Anhänger tanzte, während sie ihn hielt.",

							"Asher stayed quiet for a moment longer before raising his hand to explain himself. Before he could, though, the candle relit itself: this time a normal orange color. Asher's mouth stopped mid-syllable and returned to its previously puzzled expression.",
							"\"Well, now it's ruined. We'll never figure this out. It's just a stupid candle now.\" Sven angrily gathered his notes in his hands.",
							"\"Smells nice, though,\" said Asher.",
							"Unceremoniously, Sven began to hold his notes over the fire. He looked pointedly at the genasi. \"See? These notes are worthless now. all this talk of a blue flame and we're reduced to a simple scented candle. Now I'm tired and hungry.\"",
							"The dramatic effect he was looking for was lost, however, as the paper refused to catch. Sven held one sheet of notes after another over the candle, each one refusing to light. He sunk back down into his chair by the table. He rubbed his eyes and sighed.",
							"\"I'm sorry, Asher. I let it get the better of me. You did the right thing, and I over-reacted.\" He reached into his bag and pulled out a scone. He held it out to his friend. Asher took it.",
							"\"I knew you'd come around. You always do.\" Asher's mouth was full, but still kept a focus on the candle.",
							"As if to continue what Sven had started, Asher held a blank piece of parchment over the candle. The fire danced along the surface of the sheet, and on its surface darkened characters began to emerge. Asher nearly choked on the scone to get Sven's attention.",
							"\"Sven! I got it! Look!\"",
							"The two of them peered with baited breath over the paper, gradually forming letters as the paper was heated by the orange flame. They pulled back the sheet when the message was finished and the candle went out: its purpose now complete.",
							"\"...Sven and Asher are goblin-faced nu-nu-brains. Go soak your heads,\" read Asher. They both looked at the other, not knowing how to respond to the paper's childish insult.",
							"From beyond the door a great, raucous laugh was heard. Bry'Li-Anss burst in, clutching his sides from the laughter. In his hand was a candle, its flame a chilling blue. The Eladrin's pale skin reflected the blue light naturally.",
							"Still wheezing, he continued, \"Oh man, that was the best one yet. You should have heard Pyrivol and Gideon shouting about this thing, too. Too funny.\" Sven and Asher still held the paper, mouths agape and looking blankly at the elf.",
							"Bry caught his breath, \"So? Wanna leave this with the Tabaxi downstairs? See if ol' Snowflake pulls his fur out?\"",
							"Sven was the first to nod, after a moment, immediately followed by Asher grabbing the candle and his coat from the hanger nearby",
							"\"Definitely,\" the genasi said, \"but I want to write the message this time!\""

Hcor'uk slung boulders as if they were pebbles with the aid of a magical rope he'd stolen from a great wizard. One after another, he hurled the great rocks into the city's stone walls, tearing it down further and further with each passing moment. He used the fallen pieces of wall as more ammunition, adding insult to injury, and continued the assault to breach the city's limits. He was a siege crew all in one creature, and the city lay powerless before him....",

					"Countless were slaughtered, and only a few lucky souls were able to escape the ogre's unending onslaught. It was left to a passing band of adventurers, ones not unlike yourselves, to save the city from Hcor'uk's grasp. Two days after entering the city, when almost all hope was lost, the band of adventurers climbed back over the fallen wall's remains, victorious. Behind them they carried the same rope once used to lay ruin to the city, but wrapped within it lay the severed head of Hcor'uk, the Colossal.",

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 14) or become constricted by the tentacle, dealing 1d4+2 bludgeoning damage immediately after failing the saving throw and again at the end of each of its subsequent turns while gripped by the tentacle. The creature may reattempt the saving throw as an action each turn to try and escape the tentacle again. While holding a creature in this way, you cannot make attacks with the whip. You may end this affect at any time (no action required).",

If you drop the whip while a creature is gripped by the tentacle, both your and the creature's movement returns to normal, although the tentacle will continue to hold and damage the creature until it breaks free."
