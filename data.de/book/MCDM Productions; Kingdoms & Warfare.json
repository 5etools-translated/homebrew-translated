						"I have always viewed the worlds of fantasy RPGs in terms of domains. The idea that the world is divided into spheres of influence and power, with specific people in charge of those things. Even as a teenager, I played in lots of different fantasy worlds, and I judged them all based on one thing: the map. I used maps as the keys that unlocked the different domains in a world.",
						"Maps are one of the GM's most powerful tools. The map of the local area, the map of the region, the map of the city, the map of the world. Because maps invite exploration. A map explicitly asks the players to pore over it, point to something evocative or mysterious, and ask: \"What's this?\"",
						"In the '80s and early '90s, there was an explosion of new, official campaign settings. New fantasy worlds for RPGs. And my friends and I were excited to try them. But whenever I saw the mapIn the '80s and early '90s, there was an explosion of new, official campaign settings. New fantasy worlds for RPGs. And my friends and I were excited to try them. But whenever I saw the map of a new world, I always wondered the same thing: \"Who's in charge here?\" I don't know why that was important to me. Probably, I was just looking for some kind of organizing principle. Some kind of lens to view all this new information through.",
						"I didn't literally think, \"Whose domain is this?\" I wouldn't have used that language. And I never thought exclusively about barons and dukes and queens. If I pointed to a great forest, I wouldn't expect it to belong to a feudal noble. I know how fantasy works: it's a big forest, so it probably belongs to the elves!",
						"But which elves? Surely a forest this big is an important asset, and some elven court considers it their realm. Their domain. And if not, that's probably because it's contested! A hot or cold war over ancient elven boundaries! Drama!",
						"Or maybe the forest belongs to an order of powerful druids. Maybe they keep it deliberately wild and pool their resources to ensure no single civilization takes it over! Well, those druids would be just another domain.",
						"That's how my mind worked then, and how it still works. It's okay if some places aren't controlled by anyone. But then, as now, when I see a map of a fantasy world and there are no political boundaries, no answers, no information to tell me, \"Who's in charge?\" anywhere, I get disappointed. I feel like...there's a layer of information missing.",
						"To date, there's never been an edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game whose core rules took the idea of different domains\u2014whether those are counts and dukes and queens, or druid enclaves, wizard circles, or knightly orders\u2014and gave them mechanical features. Not just, \"Oh, you get this one feature if you join this organization,\" but rules for letting different organizations engage in planning, conspiracy, and conflict the way people do.",
						"That's what this book tries to do. I wanted to give you the tools to add organizations and warfare to your games and make doing so fun. When players think about their own party of heroes, even without changing anything about their characters, I hope they'll recognize at least one of the organizations or specializations in here as fitting their group.2 When GMs see all the different NPC realms in the book, I hope they'll want to run new adventures with a hag coven as the villain, building a secret army in the swamp. Or an evil empire run by an immortal dragon. A draconic tyranny!",
						"When players choose an organization and a specialization, their characters gain new mechanical features\u2014but they'll also feel more like a formal group. They'll have to communicate more to use their new domain powers, and will argue about how best to use domain features during a new phase of the game, called intrigue. Everyone will communicate, argue, and compromise\u2014just like the members of a real organization.",
						"This book will give the heroes and villains in your games more influence, more impact. Their reach will extend beyond the end of their swords or the range of their spells. The party's agents can go out and spy, research, build, and negotiate, all while the heroes are dungeon delving. And of course, when those heroes discover that another domain is building an army to march against the people who look to them for leadership, they can build their own army and prepare for war!",

						"There's a lot in this book, but what's here ultimately boils down to two systems: intrigue and warfare.",
						"{@b Intrigue} is conflict between two domains. A holy church versus a mystic circle. The Knights Templar against a dragon tyrant. A bunch of disorganized misfit adventurers against a nation of undead!",
						"A {@b domain} is a pretty simple thing as a game concept. It's got four skills. It uses actions and reactions and bonus actions, just like characters and monsters. It has three defenses, but no hit points. The only way to \"kill\" a domain is to neutralize its officers\u2014although some might escape and start a new domain for the sequel campaign! A domain could be a kingdom, thieves' guild, or druid circle!",
						"An intrigue only ever takes place between two domains. That makes the system simple and easy to keep track of. Other domains might get involved, but purely as allies, lending aid. Of course, depending on the adventure, it's possible that a particular intrigue is just a prelude to another larger intrigue as the characters discover the villainous realm they just defeated was only a pawn in an even larger game....",
						"Alongside the intrigue system, the book presents eight different heroic organizations (each of which can be customized with three specializations) and sixteen different NPC realms to use as allies, neutral observers, or enemies.",
						"{@b Warfare} is conflict between units of soldiers and monsters. Along with rules for warfare, you'll find seventy-eight special units in this book and another sixty-four in the special unit deck available on our store (at {@i mcdmproductions.com/warfare-deck}).",
						"So while it might look like an enormous amount of stuff in here at first glance, it's really just two systems, each relatively straightforward, and then a ton of options for those systems.",
						"The book also contains a handful of new items that can affect intrigue or warfare. And because they were popular in {@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}, you get some new legendary artifacts called the codices. (Warning! They will unravel the fabric of reality!)",
						"Strongholds & Followers presented six courts of extraplanar creatures that the gods might send to aid characters in battle if their faith is strong enough. Those were so popular that we expanded them with three additional courts\u2014devils, demons, and undead. New monsters! Some of these creatures use the action-oriented design philosophy mentioned in \"Running the Game #83,\" designed to make it easier for a GM to use a single monster to challenge an entire party.",
						"Finally, there's an adventure designed to help you use and understand these rules. It's basically a big, detailed example of how the intrigue and warfare systems can work.",
						{
							"type": "entries",
							"name": "How to Use This Book",
							"page": 1,
							"entries": [
								"First, you should check out the {@b Glossary of Terms} section, which covers all the new terms the book uses. Don't worry about reading the whole thing, but just skimming it to familiarize yourself with the concepts will help a lot. And you can always refer back to the glossary if you're looking for a quick definition.",
								"One of the design goals of this book was to make as few assumptions as possible about your game. You can start using these rules right now, with your existing characters in the middle of your current campaign\u2014or even right in the middle of an adventure. In fact, we hope these rules take your group and your adventures and elevate them, granting everything a broader scope and a feeling of raising the stakes. In a world where the forces of powerful domains vie for control of ancient artifacts and forgotten lore, every adventuring party and their enemies can now be listed among those domains.",
								"The easiest way to adopt these rules is to imagine that the heroes in your game are already an organization, with the players picking the specific type of organization from the eight in this book. Then set up the villains of the adventure as a villainous realm, which the GM picks from among the sixteen in the book.",
								"You can stop there if you like. Domains have options that give their officers\u2014both characters and NPCs\u2014more things to do during an adventure or between adventures. But an organization is more than just its officers. There are followers, agents, and employees all ready to carry out the characters' and NPCs' orders. As such, leading a domain means players can have their organization conduct research or espionage while the characters continue exploring dungeons or fighting dragons.",
								"Domains grant their officers access to domain features that become usable during intrigue. The GM will use the rules for intrigue to make the campaign more memorable as it moves toward one or more warfare battles that mark the intrigue's conclusion, with the heroes plotting and scheming against a villain as their organization uses its domain features and domain skills to prepare for battle\u2014even as the villain does the same!",
								"Domains also grant their officers access to domain powers. These are new special features that allow characters to work together during any combat that takes place during intrigue against the officers of an opposed domain\u2014just as the villain and their lieutenants will be working together on that opposing side. This includes the combat that runs alongside the potential climactic final battle at the end of intrigue. (Though not all adventures need to have a final battle, it's great fun!)",
								"The warfare rules in this book are robust enough to be used as their own game. This can be a fun way to play out small skirmishes or major battles, and it works fine without using the rules for intrigue.",
								"But finally\u2014and most ambitiously\u2014all these rules work together as a whole. The heroes become an organization as they plot and scheme against the villain's realm, making allies and raising an army. Time and again, they confront enemy leaders in combat using their new domain powers while their loyal forces clash around them! And though they might not be something that ends up a part of every session, battles between the armies of domains can lend an epic feel to any adventure. It's a little more work, certainly, but that work pays off in the kind of conflict that pushes players and GMs toward the biggest possible adventure finale.",
								"There might be other things you wish this system did. If we've done a good job, it'll be easy for you to design your own optional rules that expand on this framework. We look forward to seeing what you do with the content that follows!",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"name": "Combat and Battle",
									"entries": [
										"To keep clear the differences between warfare and characters engaging in combat, this book uses \"combat\" to refer to characters and monsters skirmishing using the game's normal rules. \"Battle\" is used to refer to armies clashing using the warfare rules."
									]
								}
							]
						},
						{
							"type": "entries",
							"name": "Scale",
							"page": 2,
							"entries": [
								"Another thing this book makes no assumptions about is the scale of your game\u2014specifically, the units of distance you use on your campaign map. How much territory a domain controls is something left to the GM\u2014if it ever comes up at all. Domains can come into conflict all on their own as villains try to blow up the world or some small part of it, and the heroes trying to stop them likely don't need to know, \"Exactly how many square miles do they control?\"",
								"In addition to helping keep these rules flexible and easy to adopt, worrying about the literal area of a territory likely isn't something most people will find exciting in a game about pretending to be an elf who fights dragons. So in the end, the rules simply assume it takes about a week (however this is defined in your world) for a domain to carry out a single domain action. And even that can be easily tweaked to any length of time, as it's deliberately abstract. For a particular game, it might work to have a domain turn be a week at the beginning of an intrigue, but then only a single day at the end as the pace quickens and the stakes rise."

								"\"We sell it back to them,\" Narco said. \"Hang on... then what are you gonna put on your bolts?\"",
								"Aurex nodded her head in agreement. \"Need I remind you,\" the half-devil assassin said, \"before your mind of chemicals and formulae overheats from its own cleverness, it took our people three weeks to steal those vials of {@i dreamtime}. And they managed to get in, get it, and get out without anyone noticing. Those resources could have been put to better use if that drug doesn't end up on a bolt in Castagan.\"",
								"Loroyan Thel, the drow brains of the Operation, peered at Narco from across the corner table of the quiet tavern. \"We can handle the paladin with or without magic poison, demidevil,\" he said, almost under his breath.",
								"\"And get him to talk?\" Aurex said. \"Under {@i dreamtime}, he'll talk while he sleeps\u2014and we'll know it's the truth.\"",
								"Thel sighed. \"I'm aware of that.\"",
								"\"I thought the sleep juice was for your bolts,\" Zarek said. Not unusually, the half-orc enforcer felt two steps behind the conversation.",
								"\"Forget the bolts, Zarek,\" Aurex said. \"I want to hear what our alchemist director of narcotics has in mind.\"",
								"Narco turned to the half-devil. \"Aurex, don't you see?\" He smiled riotously, tossed a small vial into the air, then snatched it back again. \"It's exactly as you said. Our agents got into the Tower of the Lens, got the drug, got out with no alarms. No searching, no deaths, no guards alerted. No trace.\"",
								"No one spoke.",
								"\"No trace... of us. So we take this back to the Lens, and we tell them we lifted it off someone who tried to sell it to us.\"",
								"\"Ah...\" Zarek said.",
								"\"No good.\" Thel shook his head. \"They'll rumble that. Wizards are reliably clueless, but they're not stupid.\"",
								"\"Hey, what if we kill someone?\" Zarek said. Everyone frowned at him, as this was his solution to everything. It would be on his family crest if fate ever conspired to make a noble of him.",
								"Still, the half-orc had a point, so they let him continue. \"Okay, check this out, yeah? If it's just us, sure, they'll rumble that like Thel says. But if we give them a body? And we say, yeah this piece of piss tried to sell us this juice, but we didn't even know what it was! We asked him where he got it, he got defensive. Says he stole it from you wizards, right? And we said, 'Oh, you trying to offload your scrab on us so you can go back to the Lens and frame us? Pull the other one.' Then he got pissy and tried something, and we sorta had to kill him or whatever!\"",
								"Everyone was looking at Zarek.",
								"\"Right? So they see this body and they start wondering, 'Who's this, right?' And if they're wondering that, they're not wondering... about us.\"",
								"Thel slowly smiled and looked at Narco, who smiled back and waggled his eyebrows.",
								"Then they turned to look at Aurex, whose visage was inscrutable. Slowly, she spoke.",
								"\"It might work.\"",
								"\"Good enough for me,\" Thel said. \"Let's give it a shot. Well done, Zarek.\"",
								"\"Oh, thanks, boss,\" the enforcer said, beaming with pride.",
								"\"You people done scheming?\" A small, snarling voice piped up as Garrote, the Operation's chief negotiator and resident goblin officer, hopped up onto a chair.",
								"Thel explained the plan.",
								"The goblin was impressed. \"Hey, you came up with that all on your own?\" he asked Narco.",
								"\"Well, I...\"",
								"\"Not bad for a drug addict.\"",
								"\"Garrote,\" Thel warned. Narco looked hurt. Unlike the rest of the officers of the Operation, he wasn't a killer by trade.",
								"The goblin looked around the table. \"That it?\" he said. \"That all you got?\"",
								"Aurex took out her sin-metal blade and began polishing it again, looking meaningfully at the goblin.",
								"\"Oh yes, you're all very clever,\" Garrote said. \"But unless you've forgotten...\" He stabbed a dagger into the map of the temple the group intended to infiltrate, there to confront and combat the order of paladins who were, of late, bent on the destruction of the Operation. \"We still got this shit to deal with.\"",
								"\"With all the intel Aurex ferreted out?\" Thel said. \"Their wizard's true name? The guards you blackmailed?\"",
								"\"Thel, they have an army. They know we're coming for 'em. They're gonna surround this place so tight a mouse couldn't get in.\" Garrote pointed to Narco. \"And don't get any ideas. I'm not gonna be a mouse again, so put those filthy potions away.\"",
								"\"Yeah, that is a pisser,\" Zarek said. \"We gonna fight our way in, boss?\"",
								"\"Well, it's been a month. I was hoping a solution to that would have presented itself.\" Thel frowned. \"It's not too late to seek special assistance. We could call up the Crew.\"",
								"\"Don't you get it?\" The goblin smiled, chuckling. \"Narco here got halfway there, but it's up to the charming goblin to seal the deal.\"",
								"\"Get it over with,\" Aurex said. She held out her blade to see the dim light of the tavern glint off the shining gray metal before being absorbed.",
								"Garrote's face fell. Aurex and her blade. \"Yeah. Anyway. We take the {@i dreamtime} back to the Tower of the Lens, we give 'em some corpse they can pin all their suspicion on, just like Narco and Zarek say. Then we say 'Goodness, would you like this back? Seems expensive.' But then we say, 'We don't want paying.' Maybe Aurex's people dig up some dirt on the Lens? Should they even have this stuff? It's illegal as shit. So, you know, we embarrass 'em, lie to 'em, give 'em someone else to be suspicious of, a little blackmail thrown in for good measure. Then we just offer to give it back to 'em. Free.\"",
								"\"To what end, Garrote?\"",
								"The goblin grinned. \"So they volunteer to take care of our little military problem for us.\"",
								"No one spoke. The officers of the Operation were all uniformly stunned. Thel looked at Aurex and Narco. \"They could do it,\" he said.",
								"Narco nodded. \"Lend us a unit of elementals, show how grateful they are.\"",
								"Aurex frowned, hating to admit the goblin was right. \"You got it in you to brace a quaesitor of the Lens?\"",
								"Garrote made a \"psh\" noise. \"Wizards are easy. You just gotta flatter 'em before you threaten 'em.\" He smiled. \"By the time I'm done with 'em, they'll think it was their idea.\"",
								"\"I can try and dig up something on their quaesitor,\" Aurex said. \"Give Garrote some ammo.\"",
								"Thel put his hands flat on the table. \"Intel says we got a week before the Order of the Black Pegasus comes after us, and I intend to go after them first. So...work your magics, and let's see if we can't convince the Lens they owe us a favor.\"",
								"\"Blackmail, intel, drugs.\" Garrote nodded at the three vials of {@i dreamtime}. \"Just a day's work for us, boss.\"",
								"Zarek finally caught up. \"Heh. This is good, you guys. Oh yeah, this is gonna be fun. This is real thieves' guild shit.\""

						"Every fantasy RPG campaign contains domains. The local church is one. The baron, their court, and the people of the barony are another. The thieves' guild. The secret society of rangers and druids. Whatever your choice of fantasy subgenre, your campaign contains many different domains feeding a network of alliances, allegiances, suspicions, and grudges.",
						"The rules in this book give you a straightforward way to represent those domains with game mechanics, and to allow the player characters to step up onto a larger stage and translate their influence from adventuring into political power. Player-run domains are called {@b organizations}. NPC-run domains are called {@b realms}. This book presents eight different player organizations, each with three specialties, and another sixteen NPC realms.",
						"When two domains come into direct conflict, this is called an {@b intrigue}. The purpose of intrigue is to move toward a climactic confrontation involving combat between the officers of opposed domains and battles between their armies. Some adventures might end with just a final warfare battle at the end of intrigue, while others will feature numerous smaller battles leading up to a final battle alongside a final combat between the characters and the officers of an opposed domain. A domain can be destroyed only by neutralizing its officers. As such, once an intrigue starts, it continues until initiative is called for the final showdown between the domains' officers.",

								"Running nations and guilds and churches and spy networks can be incredibly complex. It's easy to imagine a highly detailed game system that can model a world at this level. Tracking a barony's food supply, determining how much iron is available to a duchy, mapping out a spy network's elaborate web of agents, or even maintaining a list of a local religion's temples and shrines\u2014it's all a complicated process. Games like that already exist, and are typically complex grand-strategy simulations that might even require a computer to run them.",
								"This book takes a different approach.",
								"First off, these rules understand that you're already playing a complex fantasy RPG. We all know that just managing a single character or a world of NPCs can be a lot of work. So ideally, any domain management system has to be something that sits lightly on top of the game that players and GMs are already enjoying.",
								"Furthermore, the game almost always has a heavy focus on fighting monsters. Most monsters are defined by their combat prowess, and many of a character's best class features revolve around making them a better monster fighter. By assuming that training followers makes characters better at the stuff they're already good at\u2014whether that means research, study, or fighting\u2014running a domain provides another way to improve the effectiveness of player characters and NPCs in combat.",
								"Finally, almost every adventure involves some villain plotting and scheming while the heroes try to stop them. This system assumes that the villain runs their own villainous realm, that the player characters' organization is actively trying to stop them, and that this conflict will eventually come to a head in an all-out battle\u2014or perhaps more than one. This is the same way things would pan out if you weren't using the new rules in this book. But with these rules, every officer in a domain has new special features called domain powers. These powers require communication and cooperation to use, even as armies clash in warfare to all sides.",
								"In simplest terms, the rules in this book assume that characters continue adventuring as they normally do. While the characters are adventuring, slowly working their way toward a final confrontation with the villain, their domain is looking for allies to lend aid, investigating the villain and their lieutenants to learn their secrets, and disrupting the workings of the villain's realm to weaken that realm's forces in a final showdown. Even for a campaign that's in the middle of an adventure right now, players and GMs can adopt the new rules in this book to provide a framework for the campaign's existing plots and intrigue\u2014then raise the stakes for both heroes and enemies in a warfare battle!",
								"The adventure included with this book\u2014\"The Regent of Bedegar\"\u2014serves as an example of how a straightforward adventure can include rewards such as military units or resistance to an opposing realm's features based on a domain's actions during the adventure."

For example, if the party's organization is an underworld syndicate, that organization includes all the members of the syndicate down to the lowest-level agents keeping their ears to the ground and feeding the characters information. Likewise, an organization set up as a noble court might include large numbers of farmers and laborers who rely on the heroes for protection, and who are ready to serve to show their thanks.",

										"Players can make choices for spending development points as a group, or each player can do what they like individually. The GM can also weigh in if necessary, depending on the circumstances of the campaign. For example, in a campaign where one character has inherited a barony from their parent and the other characters are the new baron's lieutenants, it might make sense for the new baron's player to spend most of the organization's initial development points.

When a box with a value in it is marked off, the organization's skills or defenses become that number. For example, if an organization has +2 marked off in Diplomacy and the players mark off the next two boxes to reach +3, the organization's Diplomacy modifier increases to +3. If Resolve starts at 10 and the players mark off the next six boxes, the organization's Resolve increases to 15.",

At the same time, though, the lack of a tank and a healer makes such a group more fragile and less versatile than a typical group of adventurers. But in a thieves' guild organization whose officers are all rogues, titles help shore up these deficiencies.",

Each unit gains benefits in battle based on a player character's class (see {@book Martial Advantages|KaW|3|Martial Advantages} on page 111), but a character's features, traits, spells, and feats mostly help make them better at fighting monsters.

The easiest and most fun way to do this is to run and resolve the battle first, then the combat, even though both are actually happening simultaneously. This works much the same way that players in combat resolve their characters' actions in distinct turns, even though in reality the characters are all moving and attacking at the same time.",

This is not wholly realistic, but it is dramatic\u2014and it allows the game to continue to focus on the heroes and their actions. Their army will win or lose before the end of the combat, and the victors gain a sudden and dramatic bonus reflecting the rush of adrenaline.",

So they know who's going to win\u2014and on what turn\u2014 going into their own final fight.

Six of the most common ancestries are discussed below\u2014humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblinoids (including hobgoblins and bugbears), and undead. These ancestries cover many of the peoples and forces that players and GMs might commonly recruit from, with other ancestries available through the special unit deck (see below).",
								"Organizing units by ancestry is completely arbitrary, but still useful. If it makes sense for a specific campaign, any of these ancestries can be easily reskinned and referred to as specific nations, tribes, or domains. In an all-human campaign, dwarf units could represent a line of human mountain folk, while elf units stand in for the soldiers of a steadfast forest realm. In the same way, not all elf units need the same traits. A GM might develop three or four additional traits for different courts of elves in their world, so that only one court gets the Eternal trait.",
								"Each of the standard ancestries features nine units, including a variety of infantry, cavalry, and artillery units covering Tiers I, II, and III.

In other words, the stats a member of an ancestry has in combat are not related to the ancestry's stats in warfare. The things that make a good adventurer don't necessarily make a good soldier. Instead, these rules focus on how members of a particular ancestry might organize in large companies, how good they are at taking orders, how seamlessly they coordinate with dozens of other soldiers, and how they maintain their cool while taking casualties.",
										"As such, the typical stats for an elf, dwarf, or zombie in the core rules don't translate mathematically into a unit's stats. Rather, a unit focuses on culture, training, and behavior as those things apply to the requirements of a large battle. By the same token, the soldiers represented by units are not adventurers. Though they have solid combat skill, their training is mostly focused on fighting together and not breaking under pressure. A battle in a dungeon or a dragon's lair is not a place for a hundred soldiers trained with pike and shield, accustomed to deploying in formation and to count on the soldiers in front of, behind, and beside them. Army battles take place in wide-open spaces to allow this sort of unit to make best use of its soldiers' training. Cram them all into a series of 10-foot-wide corridors without light, and it drastically reduces their effectiveness.",

Human units are thus less likely to break and run when the battle gets tough or things get weird. And they're better at executing complex commands, which means their infantry are more likely to succeed on maneuvers such as Follow Up and Set for Charge. Taken in combination with the Adaptable trait that all human units have\u2014granting advantage on Morale and Command tests\u2014and humans are an ancestry optimized for warfare.",

If a unit breaks or uses the Retreat maneuver, elf infantry will very likely move into position to take advantage of that gap.",

Elf units pay undead no mind, but the units of other ancestries don't like the prospect of fighting against their own forebears risen from the grave. A sense of dread and foreboding fills the field when undead march, and especially at the beginning of a battle, undead units can have a major advantage!",

Ghoul Infantry regain lost casualties thanks to the Feast trait, allowing them to feed on the corpses of fallen enemies or allies. And the ghoul artillery unit known as the Fireborn can inflict ongoing damage with fire tokens from their special maneuver.",

Along with the Dead and Harrowing traits, this unit gains bonus movement and can move through other units thanks to its Ethereal trait. This also means units that the Black Wind attacks gain no benefit from fortifications.

So while the GM can use the same rules for building the villain's army as the players use to build the characters' army, it is perhaps more important that the army the heroes face is sufficiently challenging.
