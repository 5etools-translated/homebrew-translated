								"A weaveknight's life is almost synonymous with adventure. There is always some piece of lore or knowledge long forgotten in the world, waiting to be unveiled by a weaveknight.",
								"Furthermore, a weaveknight's character background should incorporate the reasons they decided to pursue the art, as well as their various personal goals that drove them to endure the harsh training. How did you first realize your potential for the arcane arts? Were you a soldier with untapped magical potential, discovered by another weaveknight? Perhaps one of your ancestors was a member of a weaveknight order and you found their bonded weapon and books.",
								"What weaveknight order did you train under and what relationships did you form? Were you groomed to be in the frontlines against abusers of magic, to become a teacher yourself and enlighten the future generations, or perhaps to undergo secret missions to recover lost artifacts? What secret arts and techniques did you decide to dedicate yourself to, as you polished your own unique way of fighting?",
