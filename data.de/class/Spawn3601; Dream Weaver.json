These spells he taught to a small group of mages in Netheril before fleeing to the Feywild where it is believed he had taken his final rest. The mages who used Dream Weaving attempted to uphold Ugin's traditions by honing their skills, however fear that the power they could wield would be claimed by evil forces they instead chose to claim the spells they used were simply illusions given form by the mythallars of The Netherese Empire, however, this was an obvious ruse. The manifestations were much more than simple illusions they were machinations of the mind given substance through the source of all magic. After the fall of the Netherese Empire it was believed many if not all of the Dream Weavers had been killed or died during the times of troubles following the fall of Mystra. In actuality what remained of the Dream Weavers took advantage of the confusion and instead chose to fashion a portal to the feywild in hopes that they could be reunited with their ancient master wherever he calls home.
