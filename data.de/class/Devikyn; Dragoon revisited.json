						"The Dragoon is an elite class of knight, trained specifically to fight the dragon threat. They are polearm-wielding knights that developed an aerial style of combat, so that they might better pierce the scaled hides of their mortal foes. Taking to the firmament as though it were an extension of the land, they descend upon the enemy with every ounce of their bodies behind the blow. A select few dragoons bind their souls to a dragon wyrmling egg, creating an unbreakable bond between each other. Others infuse their own blood with a dragon's, granting them ancient magic and abilities."
