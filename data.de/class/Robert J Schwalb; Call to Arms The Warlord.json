						"With murderous goblins pouring in from all sides, threatening to overrun the flanks, the battle-hardened warlord, clad in dented and scratched armor, raises her voice to shout commands that rally her allies. Although blood streaks their faces and their bodies bristle with arrows, the warlord's companions rally, regaining their mettle to push back against the brutal onslaught. What once seemed certain defeat became a victory achieved against all odds.",
						"In another battle, an elf clad in leather armor darts in the forest to lead his companions to where the hated trolls are encamped. From out of the underbrush the company emerges, taking their enemies by surprise, peppering them mightily with arrows, bolts, stones, and spears. After the hail of missile fire the trolls recover, only to find their attackers have melted away into the woods. Enraged, the trolls ferociously charge, straight into a waiting ambush prepared by the brilliant elf commander.",
						"Standing atop a sarcophagus, a dwarf armored in gleaming mail grips his axe and shakes it at the ceiling as he recites the saga of the wrongs done to his people by the orcs. With each bitter defeat and every wrong recounted, he ignites the coals of anger in the hearts of the dwarven troops assembled before him. The more the dwarf speaks, the hotter the flames burn to chase away the chill of fear and doubt, such that by the time he has finished, the gathered warriors let loose a mighty battle cry, sounding their readiness to fight.",
						"Warlords all, these characters represent just a few of the different forms these battle leaders might take. Warlords might be charismatic peasant heroes who rallied their people to overthrow tyrants, seasoned battlefield commanders who bring their experience with them when directing their allies in combat, famous warriors, figures of inspiration and more. Warlords understand battle at all levels, from small unit tactics to the grand scale of the battlefield. Capable warriors in their own right, they possess sharp minds and strong personalities, which aid them in leading their companions to success in overcoming their foes.",

When diplomacy fails and lives hang in the balance, war might be the only recourse to right wrongs, protect the innocent, and restore order in a world gone mad. Warlords understand warfare in a way few others do. They see the patterns in strikes and counterstrikes, understand the benefits of superior positioning, and learn battle-tested techniques to keep their enemies on their heels. While warlords might regret the loss of life, they see every fight as a contest they must win, using every trick at their disposal to gain the upper hand.",
								"Warlords take charge in fights. They help their allies by directing them where they can do the most good, sometimes urging them to strike at vulnerable areas or maneuvering them into position where they can gain a tactical edge. Although warlords differ in the methods they use, their presence always aids everyone who fights at their sides."

All warlords learn how to fight with a wide variety of weapons, to wear the heaviest armors, and deflect their enemies' attacks with shields. Many warlords, however, eschew the heavier gear so they can stay light on their feet to move swiftly to where their companions need them the most. Rather than specialize in certain weapons, warlords favor versatility so they can fight in whatever way they need to win the day."

First, and perhaps the most important, is to decide what happened to point you toward the way of the warlord. You might have been just an ordinary warrior, but some quality or capability set you apart from the rest. Are you a tactical genius, possessed of a mind that can see several steps ahead in any contest? Or are you a natural leader, able to inspire others through your words and actions?",
								"In addition to determining the impetus for your development, it's also worthwhile to consider how you learned your leadership abilities. Such talents might have arisen from your natural gifts and, through trial and error, you refined them until you became the leader you are today. Then again, you might have studied at one of the great war colleges, where battle-scarred veterans instruct you in the study of history's greatest battles in order to teach you tactics, strategy, and logistics.",
								"Along with your training, you had to come by your arms and armor somewhere. Did you inherit your gear from a famous ancestor? Maybe you gained your equipment upon completing your training, a gift from one of your instructors. It could be that your arms and armor are parts of a uniform, or you might have cobbled them together from pieces you found on old battlefields. Whatever you decide, your training, your weapons, and your armor help you become the battlefield leader you were born to become."
