Denkt darüber nach, Handlungsbögen zu entwickeln, die euch aus eurem Land oder eurer Burg heraus zu Abenteuern und Intrigen zwingen, damit ihr in einer Gruppe funktionieren könnt. Diese Klasse erfordert, vielleicht mehr als andere, eine besondere Berücksichtigung durch den DM. Das Weltsetting muss in gewisser Weise und in einigen Bereichen das Konzept einer föderalen oder aristokratischen Gesellschaft wertschätzen, denn wen würde es sonst interessieren, dass sich jemand einen Adligen nennt?"

Es ist jedoch kein magischer Zwang, der die Kreatur auf die Knie zwingt, sondern die Präsenz des Adeligen und die furchteinflößende Macht eines starken Charismas.",

Generell gilt, dass einige chaotische Kreaturen, die der Inbegriff des Chaos sind, wie z.B. Orks, Goblins usw., sich nicht um die Erhabenheit eines Adligen scheren. Der Spielleiter kann entscheiden, dass einige Kreaturen einen Vorteil gegen nicht-magische Effekte haben, wie z.B. die Fähigkeit aller Adligen, Suggestion mit ihrem Majestätswert zu benutzen. Der Spielleiter sollte sorgfältig abwägen, ob eine Kreatur chaotischen Philosophien anhängt und keine Form der Hierarchie innerhalb ihres eigenen kulturellen oder ethnischen Hintergrunds hat, um ihr diese Resistenz gegen adlige Fähigkeiten zu gewähren oder nicht. Dieser Vorteil gilt nur für Effekte, die direkt von Zaubern abgeleitet sind."

You cannot cast a spell or increase the spell level of a spell that's level is beyond what you would have access to in spell slots of your spellcasting level. Thus, even if you selected lightning bolt at 3rd level as a a noble, you could not gain access to casting the spell until you have 5 levels of a full spellcasting class (i.e. level 5 noble, or level 3 noble and level 2 bard, etc.)."
