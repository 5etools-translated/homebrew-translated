After a few days of the disease running its course, the victim will be fully afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy.",

Rejection of the bestial gift is a powerful statement that weakens its hold upon the body, but even more powerful is the restitution one takes to clean the soul of the taint which has infected it.",

Precautions must be made to securely chain the lycanthrope so as to prevent the healer's savage murder. The first spell to be cast is {@spell ceremony|xge} (Atonement). Provided it is successful, it will restore the sentience and intelligence of the cursed victim even whilst transformed.",

The healer must then cast {@spell lesser restoration} in order to cleanse the disease from the victim's blood, and then cast {@spell remove curse} in order to finally dispel the curse. Provided that the victim stood perfectly still during that whole process and the atonement spell took hold, then the lycanthropic curse will have finally been removed."
