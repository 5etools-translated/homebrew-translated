						"Die Halb-Orkin bewegte sich lautlos durch den Wald, ihre Tätowierungen schimmerten im Mondlicht. Sie ergriff die uralte Kriegskeule ihres Stammes und rief die Geister früherer Champions an, um ihre Schläge zu verstärken. Ein kalter Wind kam über das Lager der Hobgoblins, als die Halb-Ork in ihre Mitte trat. Diese Räuber, die es gewagt hatten, Holz aus dem Urwald ihres Volkes zu stehlen, würden die Morgendämmerung nicht mehr erleben.",
						"Der gebeugte, ältere Halbling klammerte sich an seinen Wanderstock, als der riesige Oger auf ihn zustürmte. Kurz bevor das Ungeheuer über ihn herfiel, nahm der Ältere den Geist der Großen Bestie in sich auf und verwandelte sich in einen übernatürlich massiven Bären. Die beiden stießen mit donnernder Wucht zusammen, aber nur einer würde überleben. Die Augen des großen Bären blitzten kurz in grünem Licht auf, und so plötzlich, wie er aufgetaucht war, stand an seiner Stelle ein älterer Halbling, dessen Augen in grünem Licht leuchteten.",
						"Der dünne Elf stand auf einer Klippe und überblickte die große Schlacht unter ihm. Der große Drache hatte das Bataillon der Wachen, die gekommen waren, um ihre Heimat zu verteidigen, fast vollständig dezimiert. Ein einzelner Mann stand auf und stieß seinen Speer in Richtung des furchterregenden Wyrms, doch bevor der Drache den Schlag abwehren konnte, entfesselte die Elfe einen mächtigen Geist aus einem ihrer Totems. In einem Augenblick hatte der Geist den Drachen umhüllt und ihm vorübergehend die Kraft genommen. In seinem geschwächten Zustand durchbohrte der Speer das Herz des großen Tieres und beendete seinen Feldzug des Schreckens. Die Elfe machte sich auf den Weg zurück in ihre einsame Höhle, zufrieden mit dem Wissen, dass die Stadt, die sie im Verborgenen bewachte, für eine weitere Saison sicher sein würde.",
