Using her spear to deflect as many tentacles as possible, the centaur draws the kraken's ire so that her allies can position themselves behind the kraken's weak spot. Only a moment after the centaur's signal, the kraken keels over in pain, its heart pierced with a perfectly timed barrage of arrows and steel.",

Hearing cries of pain, the shifter approaches to find an injured man leaned against a tree. Noticing the arrow lodged in his shoulder, the shifter steadies their breath and draws their shortsword. Amidst the man's wincing and the rushing water of the nearby stream, the shifter hears the subtle twang of a shortbow being knocked. They let out a high pitched whistle, and the party immediately knows to take cover. When the party wizard stands up from their prone position, they find an arrow lodged in the tree next to where their head would have been.",

In this time, the leonin delivers a few short sentences that inspire hope and resolve in the hearts of her comrades. By the time the hydra shakes off the effect, it finds that the soldiers that stand before it have become even stronger than they were before the battle began.",
