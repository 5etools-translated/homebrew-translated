						"Verletzt, aber entschlossen und mit schweißnassem Gesicht fährt der Halb-Ork mit einem Finger über seine Wunden und zeichnet eine leuchtende, rubinrote Glyphe in die Luft. Er ergreift das schwerelose, vollendete Siegel und dreht es, um dunkle magische Energien freizusetzen, die nach vorne schießen und das Ungetüm aus seinen eigenen Adern heraus verfluchen, um die Chancen zu verbessern.",
						"Eine geheimnisvolle Halbelfin in einem abgewetzten Umhang und einer robusten Lederrüstung untersucht vorsichtig eine grausige Szene am Straßenrand, ihre Augen blitzen vor Erkennen, als sie die Überreste des Massakers betrachtet. Der Überlebende, der sie vorsichtig angeheuert hat, zuckt zusammen, als die Halbelfin plötzlich auf die Füße schießt, sicher in dem Wissen, wer der Täter ist, wo er zu Hause ist und wie wenig Zeit bleibt, ihn zu finden.",
						"Die Nase des Halblings nimmt den stechenden Geruch der drohenden Gefahr auf, als sie das Schaben von Knochen und Klauen auf dem nahen Stein hört, als sie in die lichtlosen Kammern aus altem Staub und leisem Geflüster tritt. Sie zuckt zusammen, als sie ihre Klinge über ihre Handfläche gleiten lässt. Der Stahl verwandelt ihr Blut in glühende Runen mächtiger Magie, und ihr Schwert wird plötzlich von arkanen Flammen umhüllt, die das Fleisch ihrer Feinde brennen und verzehren wollen.",
						"Die oft gefürchteten oder missverstandenen Blutjäger sind kluge, arkane Krieger, die ihre Essenz mit den dunklen Kreaturen, die sie jagen, verbunden haben, um sich besser an ihre Beute anzuschleichen und zu überleben. Bewaffnet mit den Riten der verbotenen Blutmagie und der Bereitschaft, ihre eigene Vitalität und Menschlichkeit für die Sache zu opfern, schützen sie die Reiche aus den Schatten heraus, stets wachsam, um nicht zu den gleichen Monstern zu werden, die sie jagen.",

								"Während die meisten klassischen Schulen des magischen Studiums bekannt und weithin respektiert sind, sind die weniger raffinierten und makabren Beschwörungen der Blutmagie für den Großteil der zivilisierten Welt seit langem verboten und verloren. Die Blutjäger haben sich diese Techniken abseits der urteilenden Augen der Gesellschaft zurückerobert, da sie die esoterische Natur der Blutmagie als wirksam gegen das Böse erachten, das sich oft den göttlichen Mächten widersetzt, die seit jeher die Grenze halten.",
								"Durch sorgfältiges Studium und Übung haben die Blutjäger die Riten des Bluthandwerks in ihre Kampffähigkeiten integriert, indem sie einen Teil ihrer Gesundheit einbüßen, um ihre Waffen mit mächtiger Blutmagie zu erfüllen und die Elemente zu beschwören, die ihre Schläge einhüllen.",
								"Sie können ein arkanes Brandzeichen in den Körper ihrer Beute einbrennen, das die Fähigkeiten ihres Gegners behindert und seine Aggression bestraft, oder sie können ihre Feinde mit einem Blutfluch belegen und ihren Körper von innen heraus manipulieren. Diese geschickten Krieger sind bereit, alles zu erleiden, was nötig ist, um den Sieg zu erringen, und haben sich zu einer mächtigen Kraft im Kampf gegen die Schrecken geschmiedet, die die Unschuldigen bedrohen."

								"Ob es nun der Wunsch ist, in einer gefährlichen Welt etwas zu verändern, das Bedürfnis, sich für ein erlittenes Unrecht zu rächen, die Inspiration, die man durch die seltsamen und mächtigen Techniken eines anderen Blutjägers erhält, oder einfach die Suche nach einem Platz, an den man in einer gefühllosen Welt gehört - die Gründe, warum man den Fluch des Jägers auf sich nimmt und sich für dieses Leben entscheidet, sind vielfältig. Wenn man sich einem Orden von Blutjägern anschließt, schließt man sich auch einer engen Familie an, die durch den Dienst aneinander und an der gemeinsamen Sache verbunden ist. Für viele ist dies die einzige Familie, die sie kennen oder die sie verlassen haben, so dass die Verwandtschaft zwischen den Mitgliedern eines Ordens ein fast unzerstörbares Band ist.",
								"Außerhalb der Grenzen des Ordens ist das Leben eines Blutjägers jedoch oft nicht einfach. Die Rituale des Fluch des Jägers führen regelmäßig zu sichtbaren Veränderungen, die das gemeine Volk verunsichern, und das Miterleben von Hämokunst kann selbst bei den gelehrtesten Gelehrten abergläubische Angst hervorrufen. Während einige Gesellschaften die guten Taten der Orden akzeptieren, verbergen viele Blutjäger ihre Natur öffentlich, es sei denn, es ist absolut notwendig, denn sie fühlen sich in der Wildnis und den Einöden der Welt, wo die Orden üblicherweise trainieren, wohler. Dennoch ist die beste Arbeit, die ein Blutjäger leisten kann, in der Regel die Arbeit an den Armen und Wehrlosen am Rande der Gesellschaft, an denen, die anfällig für die verderbliche Wirkung von Unholden und dunklen Absichten sind. Der Gefahr der Verunglimpfung trotzend, waten diese dunklen Beschützer durch die Zivilisation und verdienen ihr Geld als Söldner oder Kopfgeldjäger, immer auf der Suche nach Anzeichen für etwas Ruchloseres unter der Oberfläche.",
								"Wenn ein Blutjäger diesen Weg wählt, hat er unwiderruflich einen Teil von sich selbst für seine Sache gegeben, physisch, emotional und manchmal auch moralisch. Die Orden der Blutjäger praktizieren ihre eigenen, einzigartigen Ideale und Methoden, wobei sie oft Techniken mit dunklen Ursprüngen anwenden, die die Stärke und den Willen dieser Wächter auf die Probe stellen. Viele ringen mit der Angst, diesen Kampf zu verlieren, so dass ein Leben der Disziplin und Wachsamkeit ihre Reisen bestimmt, wenn sie auf der Suche nach gleichgesinnten Abenteurern und dem Geflüster über dunkle Taten durch die Lande ziehen."

								"Wenn du einen Blutjäger erschaffst, sind die wichtigsten Aspekte deines Charakters die Frage, warum du zu diesem Lebensstil getrieben wurdest und warum du alles aufgeben willst, um dich in der Dunkelheit mit den Übeln, die du jagst, zu suhlen? Hast du einen geliebten Menschen an eine teuflische Bestie verloren und möchtest nun verhindern, dass andere das gleiche Schicksal erleiden? Suchst du nach einem Sinn und Geborgenheit und hast dies in dem Orden gefunden, der dich aufgenommen hat? Hast du schon immer eine Saat der Dunkelheit in dir getragen und suchst nach Verwandten, die über dich wachen und verhindern, dass du ihr erliegst? Warst du einst ein heiliger Krieger, der von seinem Glauben abfiel und verstoßen wurde, aber immer noch danach trachtest, dich der Sache des Schutzes der Unschuldigen zu widmen? Oder bist du ein Verbrecher mit einer dunklen Vergangenheit, der Wiedergutmachung leisten will und dieses Leben als Weg der Buße wählt?",
								"Welche Beziehung haben Sie zu den Kräften der Hämokunst und den Fähigkeiten, die sie Ihnen zu verleihen verspricht, wenn Sie ihrer Beherrschung näher kommen? Respektieren und fürchten Sie die uralte Kraft, die durch Ihre Adern fließt, und nutzen Sie sie nur, wenn es nötig ist? Erfreuen Sie sich an der Kraft, die sie Ihnen bietet, und nutzen Sie Ihre Gaben frei? Sind Sie besorgt, dass der Aberglaube recht hat und diese Kraft Sie schließlich in eines der Monster verwandelt, die Sie jagen? Oder haben Sie durch Ihr Studium die Gewissheit erlangt, den Geist über die Materie zu beherrschen, und sind sich sicher, dass Sie diese Gaben nutzen können, um eine hellere Morgenröte heraufzubeschwören?",
								"Bedenken Sie auch, dass ein Blutjäger zwar einem Orden angehört, viele aber auf eigene Faust losziehen, um ihre beste Arbeit zu leisten. Was hat Sie dazu gebracht, den Komfort Ihres Ordens zu verlassen? Haben Sie die Absicht, zurückzukehren, oder haben Sie beschlossen, dass Sie in der jenseitigen Welt mehr zu lernen haben? Was suchst du bei anderen Abenteurern, die dir helfen können, deine Ziele zu erreichen?",
								"Während die meisten Blutjäger einem guten oder neutralen Weg folgen, sind einige der dunklen, verführerischen Seite des Bluthandwerks verfallen und nutzen ihre Fähigkeiten für egoistische und böse Zwecke. Diese Abweichler werden immer aus dem Orden geworfen und oft zusammen mit den Kreaturen gejagt, die sie einst zu töten ausgebildet wurden."
