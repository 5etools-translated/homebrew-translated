Instead of appearing as a separate creature next to the summoner, the eidolon appears around you, so that you appear to be inside or a part of your eidolon. You direct all of the eidolon's actions while fused, perceive through its senses, and speak through its voice, as you are now one creature. You act on your initiative, and you and the eidolon cannot take separate actions. While fused with your eidolon, you can use all of your own abilities and gear. An eidolon must be your size or larger for this to happen.",
				"While fused with your eidolon, you use the eidolon's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), but retains your own mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). You gain the eidolon's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is sent back to its home plane. A spell or effect that targets you instead targets your eidolon. You also possess all your Eidolon's evolutions and features (such as Armor Class and Movement speed) while fused.",
				"Banishing effects go against your ability scores, and if your eidolon is banished, it is sent back to its plane, and you take 4d6 force damage.",
				"When you gain the Lifelink feature, you may use your reaction to sacrifice your HP to regain your temporary HP, and vice versa, with the regular restrictions."
