						"An elf nocks an arrow made of spectral blue energy into her bow. She takes careful aim, mutters a short incantation, and lets the arrow fly toward the group of orcs rushing towards her. The arrow slams into the lead orc, then shatters as it explodes into flames and engulfs their ranks.",

						"Swordmages are practitioners of both martial combat and arcane magic. To a swordmage, fighters are uncivilized brutes whose only answer to conflict is to hit things harder, while wizards are overly delicate and more at home in a library than the battlefield. Swordmages seek to combine the best of both worlds, seamlessly merging their knowledge of the arcane into battle disciplines which no pure knight or mage could hope to achieve.",

								"The term \"swordmage\" is in many respects a misnomer; the weapon employed can range from a blade to a hammer to a crossbow. What most defines a swordmage is the unshakable bond that is formed with that particular weapon. Other individuals are able to form similar arcane bonds, but the one between a swordmage and her chosen weapon goes even further.",
								"A bonded weapon is like an extension of a swordmage's own body. It is nearly impossible to rob a swordmage of it, and they are able to sense its location no matter how distant, and call it to their hand from any similar range. Some believe that each weapon contains its own minute soul, one equally capable of communicating with the Weave that surrounds everything. By forging this bond, a swordmage's capability to affect the Weave is increased."

								"Without their martial training, a swordmage would still be a formidable (though much less enigmatic) wizard. The meditations and trainings they undertake allow them to comprehend the workings of the Weave, plucking at it to create varied magical effects. Many utilize their spells to augment their own martial ability, while others instead rely on them as their primary methods of combat. Regardless of the specifics, all swordmages channel magic through their weapons, needing no other focus to cast spells.",
								"Without their magic, a swordmage would still be a practiced fighter. Some spend years practicing combat styles and martial arts, learning to intimately understand the swing of a sword or the drawing of a bow. While many wizards sharpen only their minds, swordmages ensure that their bodies become as powerful a weapon as any spell."
