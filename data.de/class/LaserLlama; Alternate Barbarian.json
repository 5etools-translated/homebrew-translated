						"Der massige Halb-Ork stieß einen blutigen Kampfschrei aus, als er vom Dach auf den Rücken des gigantischen blauen Drachen sprang. Als der große Feind in den Himmel flog, packte er die Stacheln des Drachens mit einer fast übernatürlichen Kraft. Egal wie sehr er sich drehte und wendete, der Drache konnte den Krieger nicht von seinem Rücken schütteln. Als das Ungeheuer müde wurde, zog der Halb-Ork sein Großschwert und stieß es in den Hals des Ungeheuers. Nachdem sich der Staub gelegt hatte, stieg der Krieger siegreich aus dem zerknitterten Haufen blauer Schuppen, der einst das Königreich terrorisiert hatte.",
						"Als die Goblins über die Wälle zu kommen begannen, leerte die junge Kriegerin ihren Geist und gab sich dem Blutrausch des Kampfes hin. Ihre massive Axt trennte dem ersten Goblin, der die Mauer erklomm, den Kopf ab, und bevor sein Kopf auf dem Boden aufschlug, hatte sie einen weiteren Goblin an der Kehle. Als ihr Gegner um sein mickriges Leben bettelte, stieß sie ein gutturales Gebrüll aus und warf ihn von der Spitze der Mauer. Minuten später kam sie wieder zu sich, umgeben von den gefallenen Körpern derer, die es gewagt hatten, die Zitadelle ihrer Vorfahren anzugreifen.",
						"Eine bunt zusammengewürfelte Gruppe von Abenteurern floh aus der einstürzenden Gruft, allen voran ein massiger weißer Drachengeborener. Er konnte den Ausgang vor sich sehen, aber sein Instinkt sagte ihm, dass er der Einzige war, der schnell genug war, um es hinaus zu schaffen, bevor das Dach einstürzte. Mit der uralten drakonischen Wut in seinem Blut schulterte er den steinernen Mantel der Türöffnung. Als sein letzter Gefährte es sicher hindurch geschafft hatte, stieß er ein Triumphgebrüll aus und das Gewicht der gesamten Vorderwand des Tempels fiel hinter ihm her.",

Für einige Barbaren ist es eine unwiderstehliche Gier nach Blut, die erst nachlässt, wenn jeder ihrer Feinde erschlagen zu ihren Füßen liegt. Für andere ist ihre Wut eine emotionslose Trance, die es ihnen erlaubt, alle Emotionen, Loyalitäten oder Verletzungen zu ignorieren, die ihren Kampf beeinträchtigen könnten.",

Die wilde Raserei der Wut treibt einen Barbaren dazu, seinen Feind als Erster anzugreifen, egal wie tödlich er ist. Viele Barbaren verbringen ihr Leben damit, immer größere Gegner zu suchen, um die Grenzen ihrer Wut auszutesten, und sind erst zufrieden, wenn sie einem Gegner gegenüberstehen, der es mit ihrer Stärke aufnehmen kann."
