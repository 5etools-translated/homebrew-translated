The second opponent swings his sword, and the elf's quick reflexes allow him to jump out of the way. Drawing two cards at once, the elvish man cuts both of his opponents at once.

The next time the marked creature is targeted with an attack, the attack roll against the creature has advantage, and the mark burns away on hit, dealing radiant damage to the creature equal to the gambit die roll plus your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1)."
