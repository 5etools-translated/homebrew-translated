				"Archeillus stand einst im Pantheon der alten Königreiche von Foere nur {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} unter sich selbst. Obwohl der erste Oberkönig, Macobert, behauptete, er stamme familiär vom Meeresgott Quell ab, beanspruchte er aufgrund der Gesetze und Bräuche von Archeillus die rechtmäßige Herrschaft über alle Königreiche und ihre Klientelstaaten. Trotz dieser einst berauschenden Höhepunkte des Einflusses in ganz Akados ist mit dem Niedergang von Foere auch die Verehrung von Archeillus im Niedergang begriffen. Dies wurde wohl durch die langsame Zunahme der Unterstützung für die fremde Gottheit {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} als göttliche Schutzherrin der Foerdewaith-Herrschaft gefördert, ein Trend, dessen Anfänge sich bis in die Zeit des großen, großen Enkels von Macobert, Osbert II, vor etwa sieben Jahrhunderten zurückverfolgen lassen.",
				"Er ist zwar immer noch ein wichtiger Gott der Foerdewaith, aber seine Religion wird heute oft als altmodisch oder überholt angesehen, obwohl er nach wie vor von vielen der alten Adelsfamilien verehrt wird, vor allem in den hinteren Gebieten. Diese Verehrung schließt oft sogar Adelsfamilien ein, die nicht von den Foerdewaith abstammen, oder Herrscher von Ländern außerhalb des Einflussbereichs von Foere. Dies liegt zum großen Teil daran, dass die Verehrung von Archeillus traditionell als Unterstützung der gegenwärtig herrschenden Klasse angesehen wird und dazu dient, die Aufrechterhaltung des Status quo der Macht unter den Anhängern zu rechtfertigen. Infolge dieses allgemeinen Verständnisses wird seine Religion trotz der Tatsache, dass Archeillus von Natur aus ein Gott des Rechts und des Guten ist, von so manchem weniger gütigen Tyrannen als Mittel zur Konsolidierung und zum Erhalt der Macht mit einem Anstrich von Legitimität benutzt. Die etablierte Kirche des Archeillus findet diese Praxis offiziell abstoßend, hält es aber auch für klug, nicht zu versuchen, diejenigen zu identifizieren, die regieren sollten und diejenigen, die nicht regieren sollten.",
				"Mit dem Verlust an Einfluss in den letzten Jahrhunderten und der unvermeidlichen Verringerung der Zahl der Anhänger hat der Klerus von Archeillus gelernt, vorsichtig zu sein und einen schmalen Grat zu beschreiten zwischen der klaren Aufrechterhaltung der Moral und der Herrschaft des gerechten Gesetzes, die von Archeillus repräsentiert werden, und einem vorsichtigen Vorgehen, um zu vermeiden, dass sie den Karren der lokalen Politik aus dem Dreck ziehen, was dazu führen könnte, dass sie gänzlich aus den Hallen der Macht und den Einflussbereichen entfernt werden. Viele Priester des Archeillus trösten sich mit dem oft zitierten Axiom: \"Wer regiert, tut dies nur nach dem Willen des Archeillus\", so dass die Verantwortung für die Frage der rechtmäßigen Herrschaft direkt auf die Schultern des Gottes selbst fällt. Sie vertrauen darauf, dass Archeillus' Weisheit die Details regeln wird, anstatt das Wasser durch die Intrigen und unvermeidlichen Katastrophen der unvollkommenen Sterblichen zu trüben, was der Gott vielleicht von Anfang an beabsichtigt hat."

				"Belon erscheint seinen Verehrern als älterer Mann, der wallende weiße Gewänder trägt und einen Wanderstab bei sich hat. Belon ist die Verkörperung der Dinge, die man auf der Straße lernt, sei es magisches oder weltliches Wissen. Priester des Belon dienen oft als Reiseführer und bilden sich in den örtlichen Bräuchen weiter, um denjenigen, die ihnen anvertraut sind, bessere Reisebedingungen zu bieten. Als solcher ist Belon sowohl der Schutzherr der Reisen als auch des Wissens, was sich in der Weisheit ausdrückt, die man erlangen kann, wenn man viel gereist ist. Die Betonung des gesunden Menschenverstandes sorgt dafür, dass er nicht nur unter den Gelehrten und Gebildeten, sondern auch unter dem einfachen Volk der Welt Anhänger findet.",
				"Belon der Weise war ursprünglich kein Gott des hyperboreischen oder foerdewaitischen Pantheons. Er scheint ein östlicher Gott eines noch nicht identifizierten Libynosi-Pantheons gewesen zu sein. Einige Gelehrte vermuten, dass er ein kleinerer Gott der Gohtra von Far Jaati war. Andere Hinweise deuten darauf hin, dass er vielleicht einst ein Lehrling von Thasizier war, dem libynosischen Meister der guten Magie und alten Feind der Hexengöttin Hekate. Unabhängig von seiner Herkunft scheint es wahrscheinlich, dass Belon dem Volk von Akados vorgestellt wurde, nachdem er von Foerdewaith-Kreuzfahrern, die sich in östlichen Gefilden aufhielten, nach Hause gebracht wurde.",
				"Belons frühester Einfluss in Akados scheint in und um die Stadt Bard's Gate gewesen zu sein, wo er sich als Gott des Reisens in einer aufblühenden Stadt von Händlern und Reisenden einiger Beliebtheit erfreute. Im Laufe der Zeit nahm seine Verehrung jedoch zugunsten anderer Götter ab, die den Merkantilismus und den Handel zu ihren Interessengebieten zählen, wie etwa Sefagreth und Tykee. In jüngster Zeit ist die Kirche von Belon jedoch wieder im Aufwind, da das Interesse an ihm als Gott des arkanen Wissens, der vielleicht Geheimnisse der alten Magie des Ostens vermitteln kann, wieder zunimmt. Weniger als Gott der Reisenden, sondern vielmehr als Gott der Zauberer, die sich selbst als kultiviert und weit gereist betrachten, ist es jetzt in Mode, den Weißen Wanderer zu verehren. Dieser Aufschwung wurde vom Klerus des traditionellen Magiegottes Jamboor bemerkt, und seit Jahren wird unter den Gelehrten dieses Gottes darüber diskutiert, was zu tun sei, da sich immer mehr Anhänger der arkanen Künste Belon als ihrem Schutzpatron zuwenden."

				"Ceres ist eine alte Göttin des hyperboreischen Pantheons, die seit den frühesten Überlieferungen Heim und Herd beschützt hat. Sie wird als mütterliche Figur angesehen, die ihre Anhänger und deren Gemeinschaften durch sanfte Führung und Pflege beschützt. Sie ist es auch, an die sich das einfache Volk im Gebet wendet, um eine Hungersnot aufgrund einer schlechten Ernte oder Naturkatastrophen zu vermeiden. Obwohl sie nicht wirklich eine Göttin der Ernte und des Wetters wie der Gott {@deity Telophus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Telophus} ist, sprechen ihre heiligen Schriften und ihre Liturgie allgemein von einer reichen Ernte, um die Bäuche der Gemeinschaft und der Bedürftigen zu füllen.",
				"Ceres, die eher mit der wohltätigen Verwendung der Ernte unter dem Gesichtspunkt des Wohlergehens und der Stabilität der Gemeinschaft befasst ist, als dass sie als Matrone des Pflanzenwachstums im Allgemeinen angesehen wird, ist eine der wenigen Gottheiten, deren Verehrung aktive Wohltätigkeit in Form von Ernährung und Beherbergung der Bedürftigen beinhaltet. Sie wird von vielen verehrt, die nicht wirklich ihre Verehrer sind (daher ihr Titel \"Verehrte Mutter\"), weil sie als göttliche Hüterin und Aufseherin gesunder Geburten angesehen wird, obwohl sie diese Rolle mit der Göttin {@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya} teilt. Selbst diejenigen, die andere Götter verehren oder ihr sogar aufgrund ihrer Ausrichtung oder ihres Glaubens diametral gegenüberstehen, sind nicht abgeneigt, bei der Geburt ihres eigenen Nachwuchses ein kurzes Gebet in ihrem Namen zu sprechen. In ihren Händen liegt das Wohl der nächsten Generation, was alle Menschen anerkennen und im Allgemeinen respektieren. Dass ihre Anhänger keine Kreuzritter oder gewalttätige Radikale sind, die in ihrem Namen Gericht halten wollen, macht diese Verehrung durch andere erträglicher.",

Trotz ihrer anerkannten Wohltätigkeit wird Ceres als etwas rustikal angesehen und ist in einigen städtischen Zentren im Niedergang begriffen. Die Halblings-Muttergöttin Hester dient als ihre Dienerin, und viele Halblinge auf dem Lande verehren Ceres daher ebenfalls."

Obwohl seine Religion sehr alt und von vielschichtigen Traditionen und Ritualen durchdrungen ist, ist er den meisten Nicht-Elfen vor allem durch seine legendäre Suche nach seiner Frau Rialae-Aibaru (bekannt als die Verlorene Königin der Elfen) bekannt, die ihn und ihre Pflichten im elfischen Pantheon verlassen hat, um ihre verschwundene Tochter Karelis zu suchen, die irgendwann in den Nebeln der Zeit verschwand. Es gibt ganze Sekten von Elfen, die die Verlorene Königin und ihre Suche durch die seltenen Erscheinungen des blauen Kometen Rialae verehren, obwohl Darach-Albith seinerseits angesichts seiner unendlichen Trauer stoisch zu bleiben scheint."

				"Dre'uain erscheint als keulenfüßiger Gnom mit kräftigen, aber feinfingrigen Händen. Sein feuerrotes Haar und sein Bart scheinen von seiner Arbeit an der Schmiede immer angesengt zu sein. Er hat eine lange Nase und stechend neugierige Augen und trägt eine rußbedeckte Schürze. Hammer Mittelschmerz behauptet, alles, was er über Handwerk und Erfindungen weiß, von Dre'uain gelernt zu haben.",
				"Dre'uain wird von vielen als eine der ältesten Gottheiten angesehen und verkörpert den kreativen Geist und dessen Fähigkeit, Objekte und Geräte zu erschaffen. Dre'uain wird von Schöpfern, Erfindern, Schmieden, Architekten und anderen Kunsthandwerkern aller Völker verehrt. Seine Verbindung zu Erdbeben, Vulkanen und anderen seismischen Ereignissen scheint ein Überbleibsel aus seinen frühesten Tagen als mächtiger Riese und Arth-Gottheit zu sein. In dieser Eigenschaft kämpfte er den frühen Mythen zufolge mit dem urzeitlichen Erdgeist Demogorgon um die Vorherrschaft. Das Ergebnis dieses Kampfes war die Verkrüppelung von Dre'uain und die Reduzierung auf seine heutige Größe sowie der Verlust seiner Herrschaft über die Erde, so dass er sich stattdessen der Beherrschung ihrer Ressourcen in Form von Erfindungen und Handwerk widmete. Demogorgon erging es vielleicht noch schlimmer: Er verlor seine Herrschaft über die Erde im Tausch gegen das Wissen um ihre tiefsten Geheimnisse, allerdings um den Preis, dass seine Psyche in zwei konkurrierende Hälften gespalten und in den Ginnungagap geworfen wurde.",
				"Seitdem hat Dre'uain eine der schwierigsten Aufgaben im ganzen Multiversum gemeistert: Er war ein Gnomengott, der zu einer Position des Respekts und der großen Verehrung unter den Menschen aufstieg und auch unter Zwergen und Halblingen viele Anhänger hat. Obwohl zwergische Handwerker und Erfinder eher Dwerfater oder Crugas verehren und Dre'uain deshalb nicht in das zwergische Pantheon aufgenommen wurde, gibt es immer noch eine ganze Reihe zwergischer Handwerker und Schmiede, die seinem Glauben lieber folgen als den eher magisch orientierten Anhängern von Crugas oder dem eindeutig rassischen Patronat von Dwerfater, vor allem unter den Hügelzwergen, die enger mit anderen Rassen zusammenarbeiten.",
				"Unter den Menschen wird Dre'uain nicht nur von Erfindern, Handwerkern und Schmieden verehrt, sondern seine Vorliebe für harte Arbeit und die Tugend der ehrlichen Arbeit hat ihn bei allen Arten von Arbeitern beliebt gemacht. Viele dieser Arbeiter folgen Stryme, da sie in ihrer Arbeit das Werk des Gottes der Stärke sehen, aber für diejenigen, deren Arbeit weniger von körperlichen Fähigkeiten abhängt, sondern eher von verbissener Entschlossenheit oder der Hingabe an langweilige oder sich wiederholende Aufgaben, trifft Dre'uain den Nagel auf den Kopf. Die Arbeiter vieler Manufakturen wenden sich aufgrund ihres gemeinsamen Glaubens an Dre'uain, was in einigen Orten zur Gründung von Gewerkschaften geführt hat.",
				"Die Anwesenheit von Dre'uains eigenem verletzten Fuß als Modell und die Tendenz einiger seiner Anhänger, sich gewerkschaftlich zu organisieren, hat unter seinen Anhängern eine Anhängerschaft von verkrüppelten Arbeitern geschaffen. Dies hat auch dazu beigetragen, dass sich unter seinen Anhängern immer mehr verwundete Soldatenveteranen befinden, die sich aufgrund ihrer Behinderung von ihren früheren Soldatengöttern abwenden und stattdessen Dre'uain um Unterstützung bitten. Ein unerwarteter Nebeneffekt dieser Entwicklung ist, dass immer mehr Bettler - verkrüppelte wie gesunde - zum Glauben finden. Diese jüngste Entwicklung hat zu großem Unbehagen und wachsendem Unmut unter den Klerikern geführt, da viele dieser Bettler als Individuen angesehen werden, die harte Arbeit zugunsten der Wohltätigkeit anderer meiden, was den eigentlichen Grundsätzen von Dre'uain zuwiderläuft. Obwohl viele Tempel offen gegen die Sünde der Faulheit predigen, um diese oder jede Verbindung mit denen, die sie als Taugenichtse ansehen, zu unterbinden, tauchen immer wieder Almosenhäuser und Suppenküchen im Namen Dre'uains auf, auch wenn sie nicht offiziell mit tatsächlichen Mitgliedern des Klerus verbunden sind. Die Kirchenhierarchie hat noch keine gute Lösung für diese Situation gefunden und ist sich uneins darüber, ob eine Lösung überhaupt notwendig ist.",
				"Dre'uain wird häufig mit der elfischen Gottheit Wayland der Schmied (Weland der Schmied im Tuatha De Pantheon) in Verbindung gebracht. Viele nehmen an, dass es sich um ein und denselben Gott unter verschiedenen Namen und in verschiedenen Aspekten handelt, doch die Zwerge bestreiten dies vehement, und die Kirchen von Dre'uain und Wayland halten sich für völlig getrennte Einheiten. Wenn es eine Verbindung zwischen Dre'uain und Wayland gibt, hat sich keine der beiden Gottheiten zu einer Stellungnahme herabgelassen.",
				"Dre'uains Tempel enthalten immer einen Altar, der aus großen Metallzahnrädern besteht, die die ewigen Mechanismen des Kosmos darstellen sollen, die Dre'uain verstehen und über die er vielleicht sogar wacht.Wahre Mitglieder von Dre'uains Klerus erkennt man an ihrer Fähigkeit, die ineinander greifenden Zahnräder von Dre'uains heiligen Symbolen zu zerlegen oder sie wieder zusammenzufügen. Dieses Geheimnis, bekannt als der \"Segen von Dre'uain\", wird ihnen direkt vom Gott verliehen. Andere, die dies versuchen, müssen eine erfolgreiche DC 45-Überprüfung auf \"Gerät deaktivieren\" ablegen."

				"The Father has existed as long as there has been life on the world now known as Lloegyr and has often been associated as an embodiment of the world itself or its primordial oceans. He has been known by many names through the ages, The Father simply being the most universal and enduring. To the ancient Phoromyceans who knew of him only through their own ancient legends, he was known as the Demiurge. To the Hyperboreans, who came along an age later, he was known as Boros and represented the planet upon which they lived as well as their home continent to the north. To the ancient peoples of the North before the coming of the Northlanders he was Buri, the grandfather of Wotan. To the Khemitite priest-kings of old he was Nun. The even more ancient Ashurians called him Engur or Abzu. The most ancient writings of Far Jaati refer to him as Dyaus Pitra, and to the Ancient Folk of Akados he was Lir.",
				"Worship of The Father predated the formation of pantheons and culturally defined religions; in fact, the existence of The Father seems to predate the concept of worship or even the existence of humanoid life on Lloegyr.To these early cultures, The Father was known as patron of tribal warfare,competition for scarce resources, survival, dominance, and rulership by might, and he was seen as a primal creator of the world, life, and the gods themselves. The Father was typically not so much revered as feared, for the savage world was harsh and unforgiving with an equally harsh and unforgiving god for the strong to cling to and the weak to perish before. Ritual bloodshed marked the holy times and sites of The Father, and human sacrifice became a standard practice under his stern gaze.",
				"Despite this near hegemony of devotion in the earliest ages of the world, worship for and even memory of The Father eventually died out, supplanted by belief in younger, gentler gods, many of whom are believed to be his children or even their offspring. Only in the most ancient records and esoteric circles is mention of The Father even found and usually then only disjointed and incomplete references. To those few with the depth of scholarship or requisite age (a few of the oldest elves and assorted dragons and undead beings) to even know of The Father, it is believed his eventual decline and erasure from the consciousness of humanity was in large part to the heroic and selfless actions of an equally primeval creator deity known only as The Goddess, mother of many of the oldest gods and both mate and mortal enemy of The Father. Thanks to her efforts, knowledge of The Father was forgotten from the world to the point that he is now considered a \"lost\" deity. None in this day and age revere The Father, nor is there liturgy available to revive his worship, except among a very few small and scattered tribal societies that exist as holdovers from those most ancient of times. Even in these cultures worship of The Father is corrupted and inexact due to lack of any written record, and such peoples themselves are in decline is well so that it is only a matter of time until The Father ceases to exist as a deific entity upon Lloegyr."

				"Kamien is one of the earliest Hyperborean deities, even predating that civilization, representing the springs and streams that provided plentiful water sources that allowed early humanoid settlements to be established and thrive. As such she became a community deity and was seen as protector of the town well, spring, or other water source required for their continued survival. As societies advanced and maintenance of water sources and the ability to find them became more sophisticated and reliable, her role as the protector of the community transformed somewhat into that of protector of travel and trade upon the waters of her streams and rivers. It is this aspect that is most frequently seen in her worship today, though settlements that greatly rely upon yearly flooding or preservation from such floods still revere her in the older incarnations through semi-annual flood festivals and the yearly Rising ceremony at midsummer to beseech her to keep the waters flowing throughout the dry season.",
				"Already considered an ancient deity among humans, Kamien's reach extends even farther back into the mists of time beyond even human civilization. In her earliest incarnation she is considered to be the mother of the nymphs and {@creature sprite|mm|sprites} and is a member of the Court of the Fey as a protector of fertility. Knowledge of this aspect is largely lost among human cultures today, though some prostitutes (usually in riverside communities) venerate the Sparkling Maiden for her seductive qualities, probably related to her relation to fey such as nymphs and {@creature nereid|tftyp|nereids} that are known for their beauty and allure. Her ancient background is further recalled vaguely in old wives' tales about the dangers of visiting the local spring or well at night because the Water Lady might come and steal the foolish visitor. That this could be a reference to Kamien and the sometimes predatory fey among her followers is a possibility, though it could just as easily be nothing more than a parental admonition to children to avoid drownings and other water accidents while unsupervised."

				"The plucky and puckish God of Halflings, Mick O'Delving is the consummate prankster and ne'er-do-well. However, whereas the gnomish god Hammer Mittelschmerz represents the gnomes' propensity for elaborate jokes and tricks, Mick is much more about finding the advantage in any situation by hook or crook and making his way with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his eye, and always one eye on the authorities. His ability to get into trouble is surpassed only by his ability to get out again. He exemplifies the halflings' ability to survive under almost any circumstances while maintaining a certain humorous and affable outlook on life.",
				"According to fables, Mick's first appearance occurred when some of the dwarven miners serving in the mines of the god Vergrimm Earthsblood complained to him about one miner who refused to wear his boots. Vergrimm descended into the depths to investigate where he found the unusually short, barefoot miner hammering away at a workface with his pickaxe while humming a jaunty tune, much to the annoyance of the dwarves laboring around him. When Vergrimm lifted the brim of his too-large helmet he met the eyes of the grimy-faced halfling good smiling merrily. Why Mick was laboring away in the dwarven mines is a question that the fables fail to answer beyond the fact that he thought it would be a grand joke upon the dwarves. Regardless, his propensity for delving and interminable sense of humor served as a perfect counterpoint to the dour dwarven god such that the two became fast friends and known drinking companions. The fact that Pekko often attends their late-night drinking bouts only adds to the legendarium of Mick and is probably the source of his nickname in many a drunken toast as Mickey Two-Cups, for the ale jack that he holds in each hand. His peculiar origins cause many dwarves to refer to him as the Little Miner, an appellation to which halflings usually take umbrage, though if it bothers Mick himself he has never said so.",
				"Despite his merry, even happy-go-lucky reputation, all of the mythology of Mick is not so jolly. The god's first wife was the goddess Sotheryn, known as Lady Suzanne among the halflings. A goddess of community, fertility, and the life-death cycle, there's was a marriage of balance and happiness with her calming, quiet demeanor serving to offset and soothe his over-enthusiastic, almost manic nature. Yet eternal happiness was not to be even among the gods, for one of Mick O'Delving's many pranks mortally offended the Queen of Spiders, vindictive goddess of the drow, and she plotted to murder him. Lady Suzanne managed to learn of the plot at the last second and drank the poison intended for him, saving him but at the cost of her own life. Perhaps the most famous composition by any halfling bard is the Lay of Sotheryn, penned in honor of the Lady Suzanne.",
				"This incident is also what has spawned own of the most peculiar organizations in the history of halflings, a secret society of halfling assassins known as the Barefeet. These folk lead seemingly normal halfling lives as farmers, brewers, bakers, or any other mundane and otherwise humble trade typically found among halflings, but all the way they wage a clandestine war against the drow and the clergy of the Queen of Spiders in particular. Spying, gathering information, and training in secret, these seemingly ordinary folk carefully plan and orchestrate deadly attacks against their hated foes at opportune moments. The local tailor might close up his shop one day to \"go visit his cousin in the next town over.\" Meanwhile in the next town over a halfling barber closes up shop to \"attend his aunt's funeral in the city,\" with the pattern repeating itself again and again across multiple communities. Then a week or so later, they return to reopen shops and resume business and life as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, while in some other location not far away a drow caravan or delegation of drow clerics is found completely slaughtered by unknown assailants.",
				"After the death of his first wife, Mick O'Delving later married the halfling goddess Hester, Handmaiden of {@deity Ceres|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Ceres} and Mother of the Hearthfire.Theirs is a relationship less ideal than that of his first marriage, with the calm and dignified Hester providing counterpoint to Mick's often wild ways, but lacking the serenity enjoyed by her predecessor. Legends speak of the arguments that have occurred in the household of Mick O'Delving, and halfling children say that the thunder is another pot or pan flung by Hester at her wayward husband. Despite these high-spirited bouts their love is genuine, though some quiet whispers speak of Hester finding love with a mortal halfling causing clerics of both faiths to offer up prayers seeking shelter from any coming turmoil."

				"Mitra has become one of the most commonly worshipped gods in Akados, despite being a transplant from eastern lands. Part of Mitra's appeal is his emphasis on humility among his worshippers while at the same time championing justice and rule of law. Thus while the powers-that-be worship Mitra to uphold their rightful rule and the laws of the land, he is appealing to the common folk for his insistence on the principles of mercy and fairness among the high and low alike. Another god that probably found its way into Akados through the crusading knights of the Foerdewaith, Mitra's true rise to prominence in the West undoubtedly stems from a single incident some 700 years ago when he allegedly appeared to the Foerdewaith overking, Osbert II, before the pivotal battle of Oescreheit Downs promising victory for the beleaguered Foerdewaith against the vastly superior numbers of the Heldring horde. When the Heldring were defeated and their threat finally broken once and for all, many took Mitra's appearance to mean that he favored the rightful rule of the Foerdewaith overkings and adopted him as the patron of Macobert's dynasty.",
				"The shift as a result of this changing attitude was gradual and took place only in small incremental steps, but its progress has been inexorable.The adoption of Mitra as a specifically Macobertian sponsor largely pushed the traditional recognition of Quell in that role to the side until recent centuries when the most devout loyalty to the Sea King has largely shifted to the maritime Empire of Oceanus. Other gods that have felt the greatest decline as a result of Mitra's rise are the sun goddess {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus} (to such an extent that many folk of Akados have begun to refer to the sun as Mitra in the Eastern fashion rather than as Sol or {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus} as has been traditionally done in the West), {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir} as a Lawful war goddess,and {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} in his role of Lawgiver and god of justice. At point in time, virtually every judge and court in Akados looked to {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} as its patron, but now Mitra predominates in that role by a narrow margin, and his influence in the areas of the sun and healing ensures that his adherents' growth continues even as {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr's} declines."

				"Solanus is the benevolent goddess of the sun, Sol as it has traditionally been named in Akados. She is a goddess of ancient Hyperborea who, as a founding deity of that culture, has known great popularity in Akados across the breadth of the empire. Her priests have often served as field medics in armies and once comprised an entire Legion of ancient Hyperborea. They have also commonly been the local healers in villages and small towns. Some hospitals were established in Solanus's name in certain imperial centers (namely Remenos and Curgantium), but the practice never caught on in more remote settings where sufficient funds from the imperial coffers were frequently unavailable. As a result, her rural clergyremained principally scattered as individual practitioners while her central high church maintained a rigid hierarchy that often looked with disdain upon the rural church as disorganized or even bumpkins. Perhaps the church's greatest claim to notoriety over the centuries, however, has been the propensity for members of her rural clergy to join adventuring bands. At one time in the empire's history, it is likely that as many as 8 out of 10 adventuring parties, mercenary companies, or freelance knights was accompanied by a cleric of Solanus, bringing great acceptance and goodwill among the common folk far beyond what could have been managed by the central offices of the church tucked away in the great cities of the empire. Many of the older bardic hero tales composed in the classical style of those times include a warrior of {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}, a wizard of {@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor}, a paladin of {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir}, and a cleric of Solanus as heroic archetypes. (They also typically include a scoundrel character devoted to Moccavallo, though this is less likely to be acknowledged in polite company.) ",
				"In recent centuries the church of Solanus has seen a steady, and in some cases precipitous, decline. This can be directly attributed to the equally steady rise in the encroaching faith of {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} from the far reaches of the East after being embraced by the Foerdewaith overkings several centuries ago. In general her worship becomes more common the farther west one travels across Akados, as the faith of {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} has not yet spread that far. Solanus is one of the three matron/patron deities of the great city of Reme (alongside Dame Torren and Mithras) and still enjoys a great degree of popularity and worship there. Her High Altar remains in that city at the venerable Hospital of St. Jethra the Martyred which still maintains 1,220 beds and accepts the sick and infirm from all over Akados who make their way to its doors."

The lawful aspect of his nature reflects this adherence to the strict natural cycles of day and night, sun and storm, and the endless revolution of the seasons. One result of this detached view of the process is that some strange druidic cults of Telophus have emerged over the centuries that take a distinctly anti-civilization view. Whether this more-malicious interpretation of his faith is bothersome to the deity is unclear, as he has never commented to his priesthood on it in one way or the other."

				"Despite his millennia of success and the establishment of no less than two current monarchies largely based on his faith, Thyr has seen a near-continuous decline across the breadth of old Hyperborean lands, especially since the rise of the Eastern god {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra}. However, his high priest notes that this decline cannot be fully laid at the feet of the upstart Mitra, because it actually precedes his dramatic appearance to Overking Osbert II seven centuries ago. Rather, High Priest Bofred of Bard's Gate points out that the first hints of the decline had occurred even before the end of the Hyperborean Empire, much less the current decline of the Foerdewaith in recent centuries, pointing to a subtle but pervasive omnipresent diminishment in civilization over this time period. A diminishment that Bofred and others fear may be a harbinger of worse things to come."

				"Yenomesh is the aged sage of the gods. He is said to have been the first to gain knowledge of the sacred runes of the Language Eternal which he taught to the gods and elevated them from the Original Chaos. Likewise it was he who created the written characters of the language known as Foundation, allowing the concepts of the Language Eternal to be grasped by mortal minds and brought the light of knowledge to the world. He is likewise credited with being the inventor of all written language since it is derived from the characters of Foundation, and his priests are often fluent in writing and speaking many different tongues. For his role in imparting knowledge upon the mortal races, libraries and archives are often dedicated to Yenomesh, and many have at least one small shrine in his honor.",
				"Despite the universality of Yenomesh's contributions to the world in the form of writing, he was not always considered to be a part of the Hyperborean pantheon. Originally Yenomesh was found only in the ancient religions of the East. It was during the Hyperborean expansion into Libynos some three-and-a-half thousand years ago that the West encountered the monastics of Yenomesh. They later recognized the value and contributions of the Yenomeshi faith when Hyperborean scholarship realized that all known languages were derived from a script that the monastics used to write their own scrolls. As scholars practiced in the arcane arts discovered that this Foundation language also served as the basis for magical writings, western wizards began to show interest in the faith as well. Yenomesh has never had sufficient popularity among magical practitioners that it threatened the faith of {@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor} or later {@deity Belon the Wise|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Belon the Wise}, but he has also had a small and devoted following of these spellcasters who delve deeply into the mysteries of alternate forms of magical writing."

				"This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with slow, oozing sickness and decay. He is the vicious dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Making his home on the plane of Tarterus at the mouth of the vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows out of the Abyss, Tsathogga's main form is a colossally bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs andfingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul humors and fluids that leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He never moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking. Tsathogga commands a host of evil creatures\u2014notably evil aberrations and his own vile frog race, the tsathar. Thousands of fawning tsathar servants continuously bathe his body in fetid slime from the evil swamp, awaiting the divine bliss of being randomly devoured by him. His hatred of light and lack of human worshippers (though there are a few notable exceptions) mean that he is little known to surface races. He has had few organized centers of worship and no standardized holy symbol\u2014each worshipper choosing its own way to best depict his deific vileness. Occasionally, tsathar priests of Tsathogga on Tarterus sculpt a small likeness of him out of foul chunks of solid waste from the Styx that harden into a vile green substance similar to soapstone when taken from that plane. Such items are prized as holy relics."
