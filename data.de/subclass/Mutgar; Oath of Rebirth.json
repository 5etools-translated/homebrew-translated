				"The Oath or Rebirth calls to paladins that believe that the forces of Good can never truly be defeated, and that hope can be given up, but cannot be killed. Sometimes called phoenix warriors, eternal lights or ash knights, these paladins wield the power of the immortal flame of faith into battle, inspiring the righteous as shining beacons of hope and consuming their enemies with cleansing fire. They serve the forces of Good with burning fury, and do not hesitate to destroy anything that opposes them, in hopes of purifying the unjust to start afresh once again. Those who swear this oath often adorn their armors and clothing with symbols of hope and immortality, like red feathers or sunrises, to reflect their unshakable faith in the providence.",
