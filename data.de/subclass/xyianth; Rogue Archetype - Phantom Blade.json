This manifested blade must appear adjacent to the creature you hit. If your attack hit multiple creatures, you choose which square adjacent of one of those creatures your manifested blade appears. The manifest blade counts an ally using the help action and so grants advantage to attacks against its chosen creature. They only last until the end of your next turn.",

If an enemy would provoke an opportunity attack from your manifested blade, you can use your reaction to direct it to attack that enemy. Using this ability does not require any additional action, but it does occupy your concentration while active. If you attempt to use this ability while it is already active, all currently manifested blades vanish before any new manifested blades appear."
