				"In a home the hearth is the center of the household, holding the fire which is used for heat, food, and light. It is symbolic of the power to hold the wilds and darkness at bay and the family within. The gods of hearth are concerned with protection of family and the sanctity of home. These gods such as Hestia, Bes, Mishakal, Boldrei, Yondalla, and Hathor are seldom well-known in their pantheons. But while there are few stories about them, they hold a small shrine in most every household. Clerics are rarely called to conflict by gods of hearth, but when they are there is usually something greater at stake than soldiers, heroes, and kings.",
