				"The Circle of the Sands connects druid to the most primal powers within the deserts and dunes. These druids serve as guardians to old ruins and temples, as well as escorts to travelers who find themselves lost in the vast desert sands. In these tasks, members of this circle gain control over the earth itself, and the power that hides within. Many druids of this circle also find themselves with a unique relationship with the dead, and the undead. Desert tombs are home to many corpses, but all deserve respect and protection from raiders and thieves. Others use their physical power to defend temples to long lost gods.",
