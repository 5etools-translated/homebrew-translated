				"Rimeblades are an obscure breed of rogue, adventurers who are imbued with the icy touch of winter. Some may have narrowly survived a frozen fate, while others may have been touched by snow-spirits or cursed while robbing a glacial tomb. They still practice their rogueish arts, but are able to summon blades of ice or conjure waves of frost to prepare their foes for a deadly strike.",
				"Rimeblades may be of any alignment or background, though something in their history will tie them to wintry powers. Once they walk the path of the Rimeblade however, they may lean towards evil, or at least selfishness - picks and knives that melt at a touch are an easy way to avoid leaving evidence, after all. Good-aligned Rimeblades may be investigators or treasure hunters, while evil Rimeblades make excellent assassins.",
