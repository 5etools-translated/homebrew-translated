Although these people can seem ordinary, a wisp of light seems to follow them wherever they go. The bond between your body and your separated soul is a crack, through which magic can seep into you from between the planes. .",

				"At 1st level, your soul is unbound from your body. It takes the form of a small, ethereal, floating light which normally orbits or flits around you. It is not a creature or object. It naturally stays in the same position as you, though you can move your soul to any point within 15 feet of you or call it back to you as a bonus action. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, your soul follows you so that it remains within 15 feet of you. You can cast your spells as though you were in the soul's position, though you must use your own senses to do so. You can also use the soul as your spellcasting focus. You are immune to being posessed. The soul sheds dim light in a 10 foot radius, and you can activate or deactivate this light as an action.",
				"In addition, the energy of the bond connecting you to your soul helps to protect you from harm. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your Sorcerer level, rounded up."

For the duration, your soul can move up to 120 feet from you. You can end the effect at any time, causing your soul to immediately return to you. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished a short or long rest."

Your soul remains in that creature's space for the duration, regardless of distance.

You can end this effect as a bonus action.",

Your soul enters its body for up to 1 hour. For the duration, your soul can be any distance from you, and you are blind and deaf to your surroundings. You instead share the senses of whichever host creature you are co-posessing, and the host maintains control of its body. However, for the duration, you can take an action on each of your turns to control the creature, but cannot move or take bonus actions, and your own body cannot take actions. When you control a host creature in this way, you can cast your Sorcerer spells from its position using your statistics, but otherwise you must use the host's statistics for actions you take. If you cast a spell with a range of self, it affects the host creature. If the host creature takes any damage, you take psychic damage equal to the damage they take. This effect ends early if the creature becomes incapacitated or if you or the creature ends it as a bonus action. When this effect ends, your soul immediately moves back to your body."
