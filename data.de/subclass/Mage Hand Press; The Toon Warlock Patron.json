				"Out on the edge of the multiverse is a demiplane called Toontown, a wacky place inhabited by toons, creatures of ink and magic that defy logic. In Toontown, the laws of space and time take a wrong turn and dive straight off a cliff; it's an eternity of loony hijinks, a torrent of silliness, a plane that despises seriousness. Toons take many forms -- often little critters or animate objects with exaggerated eyes drawn on them -- but the Barons of Toontown are known far and wide. These powerful (and copywritten) toons can let you bend the laws of space and time, provided that you leave a trail of slapstick jokes and utter silliness in your wake.",

The container's opening stretches to accommodate items of any size which can fit within the space, and items within the space are weightless until removed. When you reach into this space, any item you intend to take is magically on top. A container loses this property when you are no longer touching it."

As an action, choose a 5-foot square that you can see within 30 feet of you. A heavy, oversized anvil materializes up to 100 feet above the square and falls to the ground, crashing through any obstacle it meets on its way. A creature hit by the anvil must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and stunned until the beginning of your next turn, while literal stars orbit its head. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not stunned. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest."
