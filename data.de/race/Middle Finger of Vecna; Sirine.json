And a sirine's commitment to spontaneity is deep: they do not hesitate to act on these impulses. This can make them seem wild, but to a sirine, it is the natural state of things."

Some sirines even share their homes with other aquatic creatures such as undines and merfolk, leading to great confusion among humanoid sailors."

Furthermore, all are born with a fabulous singing voice, though some may be too shy to use it."
