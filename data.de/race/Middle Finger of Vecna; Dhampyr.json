Turns ‘em inna some kin'a macabre museum. ‘Is victims weren' people to ‘im, they were trophies waitin' to be collected. Truly sick ‘e was. Was a glorious day it was, the day ‘e was killed."

Still more testify that the dhampyr were formed by the experiments of a vampire mage. Whatever the truth, the dhampyr exist, breed with the truly living, and walk among us.",
							"Even more complex is the dhampyr's relationship to undeath. They are not truly undead, but interact unpredictably with the blood of actual vampires. Sometimes a dhampyr can become a true vampire, but other times dhampyr perish as though poisoned by the blood. Either the effects are truly random, or speak volumes about the purity and variety of different vampire bloodlines."

Perhaps their most prominent features are their pronounced canines and blood-red eyes, which shine in the moonlight like those of a predator. Dhampyr are exceedingly quick and tough, a result of the supernatural speed and fortitude of their unliving kin. Because of their nature as the spawn of the living dead, they are shunned by most living creatures. However, being partly alive, they are also spurned by their undead ancestors.",
							"With some effort, dhampyr can conceal their identities and walk among the living. Artificially coloring the skin and being careful never to smile in public is normally enough, but a dhampyr that is discovered is likely to simply be captured and executed for being a vampire, as inaccurate as this is."

The thirst of a Dhampyr is lesser than that of a true child of night, but still persistently felt. As a dhampyr can draw sustenance from normal food and drink, most dhampyr do not drink blood. Nonetheless, the dhampyr have fangs with which to drink and can partake when the cause arises."
