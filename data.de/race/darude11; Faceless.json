Usually, faceless tend to have a slender build with height a little shorter than that of an average human.

Their hair tends to be white or silver, often with a hue of another color like pink or gold. It's common for the faceless to also keep some characteristics of their ancestors from Material Plane, such as pointed ears of elven parents, stout figure of a dwarf, or tusks of an orc.",

Others take full advantage of their powers, becoming infiltrators, thieves, blackmailers and spies. Yet, some faceless live in their true form, to show others that their kind could be trusted.",
