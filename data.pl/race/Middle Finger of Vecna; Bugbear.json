He responded to each with a nod, gulp, or burp, and at last asked his only question: \"How much 'ya payin'?\""

Disarming a foe, or simply sundering a foe's weapon, are also popular bugbear tactics.",
							"Bugbear tribes are well known for ambushes, laying traps for superior forces, and fleeing when they have spilled enough blood. They are fiendishly hard to combat on even ground, even with superior numbers, due to their underhanded tactics and brute savagery. Often, bugbear raiding parties strike under cover of night, or use the level of terrain to their advantage, attacking unseen, and quickly departing."
