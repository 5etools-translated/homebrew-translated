Do you still have your original body, if not, how do you feel about your new one? Work closely with your DM to determine how much your task will factor into the campaign. Perhaps it will form a key focus or perhaps it will even fit into the down time between adventures. Maybe you have even finished your work and are living out the remaining years before you expire once again.",
