								"{@b Nezznar the Black Spider.} The infant is the reincarnation of Nezznar the Black Spider, a drow mage killed by a group of adventures in Wave Echo Cave. (The Black Spider is the main villain in Lost Mine of Phandelver.) Nezznar was a devoted follower of Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. When he died, Lolth claimed his soul and reincarnated him on the Material Plane. Her reasons are unknown, but the Spider Queen is known to weave long, complicated webs incapable of comprehension.",
								"The infant is truly an innocent being; even if he is the reincarnation of Nezznar, there is no guarantee that he will grow up to be evil or good. Whatever he becomes, fate has decided he must live and the character must keep him safe.",
								"{@b Selvetarm, the Spider that Waits.} The infant is infused with the essence of Selvetarm, the enslaved champion of Lolth known as the Spider that Waits. Selvetarm is the god of warriors and patron of male drow. Prior to Selvetarm's enslavement to Lolth, he became attracted to the goodness of Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden. Selvetarm went on to confront and defeat Zanassu, a demon lord, but at great cost.  In his weakened state after the great battle, Lolth corrupted Selvetarm and captured him.  She now keeps him trapped in her unbreakable webs for eternity. His hatred for Lolth grew so great, a piece of his essence manifested into the drow infant.",
								"{@b Halaster's Clone.} For over a thousand years, the Mad Mage Halaster Blackcloak has ruled Undermountain, the labyrinthine dungeon beneath Waterdeep. During that time he has created untold numbers of clones of himself.  Unable to resist experimentation, he often tinkered with new versions of spells, creating clones in areas of wild magic. As a result, his clones took many forms, differing from Halaster in appearance, race, gender, and personality.  These clones were kept in stasis, hidden in places throughout Undermountain and the lower reaches of Waterdeep. But on occasion, intruders have found their way into some of these secret workshops. One group of adventur- ers found an infant drow in a magical workshop and decided to rescue it. They used one of Undermountain's many portals to stow the child somewhere they believed to be safer, but were destroyed before they could return for it. The in- fant drow is and is not Halaster, containing both his powerful potential for magic and a fraction of his disturbed personality.",
								"{@b Child of an Evil Avatar.} While incarnated in the mortal world in the body of an avatar, an evil deity sowed a child with a mortal. The infant is that child. Such half-divine children can become important to a god's long-term plans. Although the dark gods Bane and Bhaal were destroyed during the crisis known as the Time of Troubles, both returned from death by using their own progeny as vessels. In fact, that seems to have been their plan all along. This drow child could be the scion of any evil deity you choose.",
								"{@b Potential Enemies.} As alluded to in the adventure, two evil factions are also seeking out the infant. The first is Gromph Baenre, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan and the second is the Szass Tam, leader of the Red Wizards of Thay. Each faction seeks to use the child for their own nefarious purposes."
