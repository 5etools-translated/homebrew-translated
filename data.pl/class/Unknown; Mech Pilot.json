						"The battle seems lost. The body of your party´s fighter dangles from a spear held by a hatefully laughing orc, meanwhile your sorcerer, that ran out of spells a while ago, screams in panic while being chased by three blood-hungry mercenaries, stabbing him with their daggers and cackling hysterically. And you? You lay in the puddle of whats left from your party. You are bleeding profusely while slowly losing conciousness. The only thing you can see now, is an army, walking towards you in perfect synchronisation, eagerly awaiting to finally fulfill their duty and collect their toll...",
						"Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you see a four-legged beast, completely made of metal appear from thin air, firing five extremely fast objects, leaving a huge cloud of smoke. A fraction of a second later, hundreds of soldiers are sent flying into the air, carried by an enormous shockwave that shakes you to the bone.",
						"As you look towards the rest of you party, you see the three mercenaries getting skewered by an enormous humanoid made of steel. It tackles them over the battlefield with abnormal speed while a tiny goblin, sitting where this thing should have its chest and neck, cackles even more insanely and happily than his victims did before. With a crunch the mercenaries are smashed against a nearby wall.",
						"You turn around to see the battlefield engulfed in flames while the first metal beast unleashes a nova of deafeningly loud shots, mowing down dozens of soldiers. The metal humanoid charges into the flames and disappeares, just to erupt again in the middle of that army, flinging around soldiers like leaves in the wind. Seconds later, it becomes silent. The battlefield has turned into an enormous bloodbath and some leftover stragglers run away in horror while one after another is taken out by a precise shot to their heads.",
						"You look over to your sorcerer, that still stares at the smashed remains of these mercenaries. You whisper: 'Are we the ones being saved?'",
						"The humanoid walks between you, blocking your sight at the sorcerer, while the first metal construct bows down to you, loading the next shot with a snarring sound....",

								"While most of the classic schools of magical study are well known and widely respected, the less refined and macabre incantations of Hemocraft have long been forbidden and lost to most of the civilized world. Blood Hunters have reclaimed these techniques away from the judging eyes of society, finding blood magic's esoteric nature effective against the evils that often defy the divine powers that historically hold the line.",
								"Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes.",
								"They can sear an arcane brand into the body of their quarry that hinders their foe's abilities and punishes their aggression, or call blood curses upon their enemies, manipulating their bodies from the inside. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent."

								"Whether driven by the wish to make a difference in a dangerous world, the need to take vengeance for a great wrong they have suffered, being inspired by witnessing the strange and powerful techniques of another blood hunter in person, or just seeking a place to belong in an uncaring world, the reasons one may take up the Hunter's Bane and choose this life are many and varied. In joining an order of blood hunters, one is also joining a tight family bound by service to each other and the common cause. For many, this is the only family they have known or have left, so the kinship felt between members of an order is a bond neigh unbreakable.",
								"Beyond the boundaries of the order, however, the life of a blood hunter is often not an easy one. The rituals of the Hunter's Bane regularly leave one visibly changed and prone to unsettle common folk, and the witnessing of hemocraft can invoke a superstitious fear from even the most learned scholar. While some societies have come to accept the good deeds of the orders, many blood hunters publicly hide their nature unless absolutely necessary, feeling more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world where the Orders commonly train. Even so, the best work a blood hunter can do usually involves the poor and defenseless on the outskirts of society, those prone to the corrupting touch of fiends and dark intension. Braving the threat of vilification, these dark protectors wade through civilization, earning coin as mercenaries or bounty hunters, ever watching for the signs of something more nefarious beneath the surface.",
								"In choosing this path, a blood hunter has irrevocably given a part of themselves to their cause, physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. The orders of blood hunters practice their own unique ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of these guardians. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle, so a life of discipline and vigilance drives their travels as they wander the country side in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot."

								"As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?",

Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?",
								"Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?",
								"While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemo craft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell."
