The exceptionally large troll he had been stalking through the night had finally stopped to rest. As the great brute laid down to sleep, a silent green shape emerged from the trees to snuff out the life of the hideous monster.",
						"As the massive blue dragon descended upon the small town, a small half-elven man rolled out of the path of a blast of lightning. With the small hairs on the back of their neck still standing up from the residual electricity, the practiced hunter knocked an arrow and let it fly in the direction of the terrible beast. As the biting dart struck true, the azure dragon let out a horrible roar and plummeted to the ground where it lay in a broken heap.",
						"As the massive owlbear slowly lumbered toward the tiny hamlet that she called home, a small halfling girl whistled to her companion in the brush. At her signal, a giant hound that seemed to be more fur then anything else, leaped out from hiding and stood defiantly in front of the owlbear. Distracted by her partner, the owlbear was caught completely unawares by the diminutive ranger. Once their foe was unconscious, the halfling and her dog released the great owlbear miles away where it could live without menacing the town they protected."
