								"All armigers share a distinct ability to bond with their weapons, connecting to weapons in an extraordinary way that allows them to manipulate them in a variety of manners. Unlike mage hand users or simple telekinetics, armigers can deftly control many weapons and utilize them in ways that exceed simple strikes. In addition to their bonded weaponry, all armigers can access an extra dimensional storage space called the armiger's armory. Herein, armigers can store their weapon collections. These armories often evolve in size and appearance, growing with their armiger. At the highest level, some armigers can even manifest their armory like a demiplane. Because of how much an armiger relies on their arsenal, many armigers tend to be weapon collectors, blacksmiths, or otherwise interested in weapons beyond the norm; for each new weapon is a new part of the armiger.",
								"An armiger's power is more than just their combat prowess. Armigers are memorable figures whose personalities are as strong as their arsenals. The armiger's charisma comes from the fact that their powers are based on their ability to connect. Whether with weapons or with people, armigers are people who are especially apt at bonding with things outside of themselves - for better and for worse. This doesn't mean that all armigers are automatically likable. Many nefarious armigers exist who use their natural presence to manipulate and control those around them. Still, more benevolent armigers also exist, who wield their influence to empower people and lead them to great acts. Regardless, all armigers are a force to be reckoned with, whether due to their force of personality or the force of their arsenals."

								"To an armiger, bonds are everything. Their bonded weaponry, for example, aren't just tools but extensions of themselves. In fact, an armiger's arsenal often reflects the personality of the armiger, evolving new features that reflect who the armiger is. And, the bonds that armigers make with people, creatures, places, ideas, and experiences are just as important to them. In the same way a {@item Armiger's Bonded Weapon|TheArmigerClass|bonded weapon} is influenced by the armiger bonded with them, the connections that armigers make can influence armigers in powerful ways. Without their bonds, not only do the armiger's abilities suffer, but perhaps most pitiful of all, so does the armiger's sense of self suffer, too.",
								"As such, armigers - though rare overall - are almost always adventurers. Whether for king and country or home and hearth, armigers undertake all manner of quests and do all manner of deeds in an effort to strengthen the connections they have and to grow new ones along the way. Even solitary armigers tend to frequent common places when resting in towns or keep a pet with them while on the road, and even malevolent armigers keep a retinue of underlings. Regardless of their background, armigers share much with each other, but perhaps the most terrifying thing they share is the unspoken fear that without their bonds (to their arsenal and to others), they are nothing. Worst of all, because many of their abilities stem from their connections, the tragic reality is that their fear might be true."

What about these connections might affect how your armiger abilities appear or are used? Do these connections serve as a source of power for your armiger's abilities?",

Were they the child of a humble weaponsmith and always felt an invisible thread to their parent's heirloom that awoke their power on the day that it was gifted to them? Perhaps they learned of their abilities later in life, when they crossed paths with a sentient weapon that unlocked something inside the armiger that was always there?",
								"Finally, take some time to ponder your armiger's arsenal (their bonded weaponry and armory), since it is a reflection of your armiger. Does your armiger prefer a certain type of weapon? Do their weapons take on a specific appearance when bonded - even if its a simple sigil of ownership? What does their armory look like and why does it look that way?
