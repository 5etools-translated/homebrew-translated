The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.",

Each creature within 30 feet of the breach as it opens must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it comes within 30 feet of the breach or starts its turn there.",

The presence of such a breach is anathema to natural life, killing and withering all plants within a mile radius. The breach remains until a month passes, you die, you create another stabilized breach, or it is forcibly closed by the will of a demon lord, dispel magic cast at 9th level, or similarly powerful effects."
