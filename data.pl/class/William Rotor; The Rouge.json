										"You can apply make-up during short or long rests.",
										"If necessary, yo ucan use the same hand to apply make-up and to perform somatic components unless your DM decides otherwise.",
										"While you are perfectly capable of applying makeup to others (and many of your spells involve doing so), your favoured face effects apply only to you. Only you can benefit from your face.",
										"Applying new makeup as part of a spell or class feature does not remove your favoured face. Only painting a new favoured face or explicitly removing your makeup cancels these abilities.",
										"Spells like {@spell vampiric touch} and your poison ivy favoured face option provide you with a reliable (if low) source of damage, but expecting to match a sorcerer twinning {@spell disintegrate} is misconstructing the intention of the rouge class, which is meant to be a social/utility controller. It is okay to rely on your teammates for damage when you excel in other areas.",
										"Many of your class features only function while you are wearing makeup. Your DM may rule that certain situations, like taking a long rest, taking a bath, or being whelmed by a {@creature water weird} remove your makeup. Don't argue with your DM; simply take the next opportunity to spend a minute reapplying it. If you feel your DM is being too punishing, explain out of character that you are assumed to have these options always available to you, and removing your makeup is like taking away a fighter's weapons and armor. It's not that it can't be done, it's that overdoing it is potentially against the spirit of the game.",
										"Most importantly, just like with bards and enchanters, your offensive abilities are best used against NPCs (and with full cooperation from your DM). Always obey the social contract of your table and consider your friends from the perspective of flesh and blood players before characters. If someone is uncomfortable with you casting {@spell charm person} on their character, for example, the correct course of action is to stop and reestablish boundaries. You are winning the game when the whole table has fun, not just you."
