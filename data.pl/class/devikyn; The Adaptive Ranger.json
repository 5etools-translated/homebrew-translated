						"Seeing the unique identity that ranger has, many have come up with great ideas that flesh out that identity even further, adding unique new abilities which make the ranger even more fun to play. I love these brews, but I have sought out to create a ranger that envelopes the ideas of the original ranger and simply allows them to be more verstaile. The ranger is cunning, adaptable, and provides useful insight to the rest of the party - and I think these changes go a long way towards allowing you to live that fantasy.",
						"These changes do make this ranger somewhat more powerful  than its base - the PHB ranger. The most impactful and flavor- neutral changes here are the ones to hunter's mark and the ranger  spells. If you find this ranger to be too powerful for your campaign, I would first revert the spell changes before trying anything else.",

								{
									"type": "list",
									"items": [
										"The ranger should be a skilled tracker and hunter. Their profession, and sometimes passion, lies in keeping the outskirts of civilization safe. It is also mentioned that they can often travel between civilizations, experiencing vastly different enemies and terrains. Why, then, do rangers turn a blind eye to all but one type of enemy and terrain? Shouldn't they adapt to each situation presented faster than anyone else?",
										"Rangers' offense is often relegated to debuff-attack, without much variety. This is because their spellcasting ability and many of their spells are heavily limited, and I believe this is intended to offset their combined ranged and tracking capabilities. However, in play, this leaves them a set of dull options that are almost entirely prevented from interacting with each other. Adding new ways to use their spells, and lifting some of the constraints, helps alleviate the issues.",
										"Their abilities are all passive. This makes them completely forgettable - as such, I've never met a ranger who remembers every passive benefit they get at all times, or a DM who can accurately account for a ranger. It also gives little incentive to role-play your class. Many people can compensate for this with clever character background, but a ranger's class is far less ingrained into the character's persona than, say, a druid or a paladin would be. You should feel like nobody can hide from you because of your skills, not simply be granted said skills without the satisfaction of earning them."

You can also use the changes to Ranger's spells known with many different kinds of homebrew rangers, as well as the PHB and Revised rangers. The overhaul to the Beast Master archetype should work with any version of the Ranger out there. There may be other changes like these in the document, but these are the easiest to adapt to almost any game."
