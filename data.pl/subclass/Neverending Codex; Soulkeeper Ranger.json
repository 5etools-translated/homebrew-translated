				"Soulkeepers are responsible for the supervision of the wilderness and all life that dwells within, often wandering over a particular area or domain and offering their portection from the unnatural and the aberrant. Unlike druids, however, upon finding a poached animal or murdered innocent, they are not above restoring the balance their own way: namely, calling the soul back to the Material Plane. They have been known to speak to spirits and\u2014\u2014in some extreme cases\u2014\u2014raise the dead back to life, but always with the utmost respect and with the soul's willing permission.",
				"Soulkeepers often have a companion of spiritual energy or of reanimated bone and tissue, which can be unsettling at times to more conventional societies, being seen as ghosts and zombies. But such companions are not beholden by dark magics, but often through a deep sacred bond that trascends life itself. Animals of the domain a Soulkeeper watches over all know the ranger in some regard, and consider them a friend, worthy of their service.",
