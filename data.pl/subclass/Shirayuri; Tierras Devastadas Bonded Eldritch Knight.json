They use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards, focusing their study on two of the eight schools of magic - abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant a Bonded Eldritch Knight additional protection in combat, while evocation spells damage many enemies at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committting them to memory rather than keeping them in a spellbook.",
