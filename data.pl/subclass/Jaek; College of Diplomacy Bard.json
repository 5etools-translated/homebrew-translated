Formally trained as couriers, aides, stewards, geishas, and ambassadors, these performers use civility and social protocol to open doors where others cannot. In mastering their craft, these individuals also learn to see the connections between magical and social networks, and recognize how each can influence the other.",

A target automatically succeeds if it can't understand your language, but if it shares more than one language with you, it makes this save with disadvantage.",

This effect lasts until the end of your next turn if you are fighting the target or if you begin to fight it, or for 1 hour otherwise. This effect ends on a target if it notices you or your allies harm it or a creature it is friendly towards.",
				"While charmed in this way, each affected target is convinced you are representing an individual, group, or power offering them fealty, an alliance, or a trade deal in its best interests. They will treat you hospitably, rationalize any of your hostile behaviors as unusual quirks, and try to persuade their allies to welcome you and your 'entourage.'",
