It can, however, be used to only grow a small portion of a creature, such as stimulating hair growth, knitting a broken bone, or scarring over a wound, without controversy. This spell even stimulates cells such as dormant hair follicles to multiply, allowing, for example, a child or female to grow a fine moustache and beard.",
