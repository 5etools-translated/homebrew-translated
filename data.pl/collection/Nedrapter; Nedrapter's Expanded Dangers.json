				"The Emerald Fragment, Laia, conceived the Druvan people as an integral part of her grand plan. These unique beings, unlike the hasty emergence of other races, patiently slumbered beneath the earth's surface as seeds for countless millennia. When the dawn of the 2nd age arrived, and mortals successfully pushed Dragons away from their burgeoning civilizations, the Druvan began their remarkable transformation. Slowly, they sprouted from the ground, adopting a humanoid form. Their divine purpose was clear: to safeguard the lush forests from the unchecked expansion of mortal cities and towns, ensuring the harmony between civilization and nature.",
				"The origins of the Druvan are shrouded in mystique. Most Druvan individuals are not acquainted with their biological parents unless a parent decides to reveal themselves. Typically, it's a benevolent Dryad who conducts a sacred ritual, planting a cluster of seeds that will eventually blossom into Druvan individuals. These Dryads plant multiple seeds, fostering a deep bond among the Druvan, often referred to as 'seedlings.' The Druvan population remains relatively scarce compared to other races, as their reproduction occurs through an intricate, time-consuming process. This rarity makes each Druvan's existence all the more precious.",
				"While Druvan prefer to remain within the sanctuary of their forest homes, there are instances where some of them grow up in close proximity to mortal settlements nestled within the woods. These Druvan may occasionally visit nearby towns or venture beyond the borders of their birthplace. These rare interactions with the outside world can lead to diverse experiences and perspectives among the Druvan. The Druvan who interact with mortals from a young age, usually have changed coloration on their skin hue.",
				"Curiously, Druvan harbor an unexpected distrust of druids, often claiming that these magic-wielders draw upon the land's magic without giving back in return. Many Druvan perceive druids as takers, extracting the earth's life force without replenishing it adequately. This distrust has led to complex relationships between the two groups, with occasional tensions simmering beneath the surface.",

Their unique physiology allows them to channel the life force of the forest directly, sustaining them without the need for traditional nourishment.
