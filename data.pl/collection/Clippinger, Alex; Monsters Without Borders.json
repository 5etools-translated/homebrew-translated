Not only this, the oozes can slide through cracks in walls and floors, patrolling corridors and stairwells that other creatures would be incapable of.",

This was achieved by feeding black puddings dozens of rings of spell turning. Eventually, the oozes absorbed the effect from these magic rings. Now, should a spell be cast against these oozes, there is a chance that the curse will be reflected straight back against the caster. ",

Although the ooze itself resists the damage, they can catch alight from the smallest spark, turning a corridor decorated with tapestries and rugs to a smoldering waste in a matter of moments. This feature has been exploited by canny adventurers, who set them alight from afar to cause distractions."

Nicknamed \"Maximilian\" by the unlikeable master, the colossus served him as it did the gods; as a weapon.

Though it seems unlikely, the legends state that the hand that bursts forth as a result of the casting of this spell is actually the hand of Maximilian, still in search of that gemstone. As the creator of Maximilian's Earthen Grasp, that was the wizard's legacy, the eternal taunting of a planar weapon. How foolish..."

The inverse is true of the Ooze Dragon; a being so strange that not even the ever-changing layers of Limbo could spit it out. Only one ooze dragon is known to exist, born as an experiment of a crazed alchemist who sought to create a weapon so powerful none could oppose them. Over years of work and arcane horrors, a wyrmlings flesh and blood was warped to become translucent and gelatinous. The dragon was driven mad by this process, however, eventually killing its creator and escaping into the wild. ",

Due to its amorphous body, the ooze dragon can absorb creatures and eat away at their flesh with its caustic ichor, melting those who cannot escape within minutes. Trails of half-digested flora and fauna can be found in the wake of the dragon and entire skeletons are commonly found here too. ",
					"{@b Terrible Reminder}. The body of the ooze dragon is entirely molded out of a translucent blue gel that loosely grips the last remaining elements of a vestigial skeleton. An entire skull is present but missing its bottom jaw, its spine and ribcage float aimlessly in its malformed torso and the claws in its feet remain. Empty eye sockets peer out of the skull but it is clear the creature can still see. In the center of the beast, a large heart has ceased beating and crystallized into a deep red gem that glistens in the light. ",
					"{@b Without Purpose}. None are sure what the ooze dragon wants, but most agree that neither does the dragon itself. It takes no permanent lair, does not attempt to communicate with other dragons and seems to have no interest in collecting treasure or relics of importance. It ignores humanoids when it can and swiftly deals with any threats without attempting diplomacy. Most regard it as a force of nature now and simply try to stay out of its way, but others have noticed from its pattern of movement that it seems to be searching for something; no one knows quite what."
