						"My first spell-slinger was a cleric of Thor who was more about crushing the enemy than healing the wounded. Choosing which spells he would be able to cast was a thrill from the very beginning.

When you add in the subclasses, domains, and appendices, you'll see that this collection broadens the scope of what spells can accomplish. If you enjoy magic in its endless variety, this book is a treasure trove of possibilities.",

Topped off by the best spells submitted by Kickstarter backers, this volume offers you a rich collection of particular styles of magic as well as everyday, highly useful spells for any caster. In its wide-ranging approach, it also includes spells designed expressly for villains and variations on three traditional spells dating from the earliest days of the game.",

Alkemancy practitioners combine their understanding of alchemical reagents and elixirs with their knowledge of spellcraft to create new and formidable magical effects.",

						"Dwarves are renowned as shapers of the physical world. Earth, stone, and metal bend to the will of dwarven hammers. It's easy to assume that because dwarves have such great skill at shaping material, they must lack the time and energy to become masters of the arcane, too\u2014but that assumption is wrong. Taking unformed matter and shaping it to conform to one's will is an effective way of blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves' greatest magic has come from this effort, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain strongholds. Few dwarves pursue the study of magic aside from devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.",
						"Ring magic is the dwarven art of forging metal into rings, often with runes inscribed on their surface, and using those rings to produce or bring about magical effects. Dedicated practitioners known as {@class wizard||ring wardens|Ring Warden|KPDM} channel their magic through specially prepared rings, increasing the devastation wreaked upon their foes, and they can even imbue spells into rings that they or someone else can unleash later.",
						"Rings created for the purpose of invoking ring magic are more than decorative hand jewelry. They often take the form of circlets of precious metal large enough to adorn a weapon, a staff, or a suit of armor. Wizards who devote themselves to ring magic are rare outside the dwarves' lands, but they're instantly recognizable by the ring-adorned stafffs they carry.",
						"Although ring magic spells often require a ring of some form as a material component, the effects they produce are quite distinct and variable, from illusions to transmutations and evocations. What they have in common is that dwarves have uncovered a way to bind the effects into rings; the deeper arcane connection between the rings and the spells is sometimes elusive.",

												"The youngest of seven siblings, Xelasora lived a happy childhood, until the disastrous day when a red dragon attacked her community and killed the rest of her family. Mentally and emotionally scarred by the experience, Xelasora withdrew into herself after she was placed in an orphanage. She was ostracized by the other children in the orphanage, who were mostly human and considered her little more than a monster. Eventually, her pent-up emotions boiled over and she unleashed some of her latent magic, setting fire to the clothing of one of her tormentors. This act led to her being expelled from the orphanage and forced to live on the streets, where she barely managed to stay alive by using her powers. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, Xelasora was taken in by the mage Dramothir, a dwarf who was intrigued by her intelligence and wit, and who was a natural sucker for a damsel in distress. Since then, Xelasora has done her best to be a dutiful apprentice and astutely handles Dramothir's busy schedule."

She constantly doubts herself and is worried that she could lose control of her sorcerous abilities if she becomes flustered or upset. The deaths of her family and the trouble she faced at the orphanage also still weigh on her heavily, and lately she has been plagued with dreams of fire and shadowy flying shapes, causing her to suddenly awaken in terror."

The dragon still exists in the form of a terrible undead monstrosity, and it shares a strange link with the young dragonborn that allows the two of them to share dreams and images of their lives. By the time the characters enter the picture, the dragon is close to discovering Xelasora's location\u2014and when it does so, it plans to slay her and recover its scrolls. Before this event comes to pass, the characters have a chance to stop it, either by destroying the dragon or somehow trapping it. Of course, defeating an undead dragon is no easy feat; depending on the characters' level, the GM might want to lead them up to the event with battles against the dragon's servants in the form of ghouls, trolls, vampires, and lesser evil dragons."

One may not choose the manner of one's death, but one can choose how to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An insect might be caught in a spider's web. Whether it lives or dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety, and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle affects all things, however remotely connected they might be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves not even a ripple behind. To confront fate, to embrace the wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake the world and make it take notice."

As an action, any creature who contributed to the pool of hit points can heal another creature by touching it and drawing hit points from the pool into the injured creature. The injured creature heals a number of hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and the hit points in the pool decrease by the same amount. This process can be repeated until the pool is exhausted or the spell's duration expires."
