						"This work is a combination of several dragon themed homebrew that I have created over the years, as well as a few collaborations. It also features art that I have commissioned from several artists, as mentioned in the Credit chapter.",
						"Dragons have always been a centerpiece for Dungeons & Dragons, and I felt that the transition of 3.5 Edition to 5th Edition left several great dragon themed works behind. As such I created this homebrew for those that want to have more dragon related content in their campaigns. It also includes several revisions of existing races and subclasses, due to how unthematic or underwhelming they have felt to many players, including myself. Particularly, the Dragonborn have felt rather underwhelming and are widely accepted to be underpowered compared to the other race options. This homebrew is meant to make them more on equal footing with the other races by giving them subraces of their own.",
						"I have also created a half dragon player race, who are less bestial than the Monster Manual version, because I based them on their more human appearance in the 2006 book Races of the Dragon, which just made more sense to me.",
						"Additionally, I've added a revised Draconic Bloodline for the sorcerer class. It is largely the same as the original, but allows for more playstyle options. This version grants additional benefits when you're within melee range of your enemies, which is traditionally dangerous for a sorcerer, and allows melee sorcerers to become more viable.",
						"I have given some subclasses mechanics that let you gain different benefits if you already have resistance, so that half dragons and dragonborn can choose thematic dragon types without being punished for having the same resistance.",
						"This work contains several subclasses, including a revised Purple Dragon Knight subclass for the fighter class, also known as the Banneret subclass. It also contains a dragon themed spell list, items, and unique items that can be gifted by dragons themselves to players. The Religion section covers draconic lore that is less known, seeing as many books already refer Tiamat and Bahamut. Which is why the kobold god Kurtulmak has the biggest section, as outside the 2006 book Races of the Dragon, little of his other side is mentioned. I have added additional dinosaurs for the Circle of Savagery (or as foes), and although the dilophosaurus and spinosaurus aren't truly accurate I felt it would be fine for a fantasy setting.",
						"The Dragon Student is a bit unusual, due to their pact choice restriction; but I wanted to shift their customization options to the dragon types to make it more interesting, and also to balance the subclass out while keeping them thematic. It is similar to the Battle Smith, yet also quite different, and so far the playtests have been promising.",
						"The content in this work has been playtested, and based on all the feedback I believe it should be fairly balanced in practice. Of course, whether you can use the content in this work is still up to the DM's discretion. I hope that you will enjoy this finalized work, as well as the artworks that I have commissioned for it, and that you may have many fun and interesting adventures with it.",

								"Half dragons, dragonborn, and kobolds are often collectively referred to as the draconic races. The one thing that all draconic races have in common is that the blood of dragons flows through their veins. Because of this, or in some cases despite this, they are naturally drawn to each other.",

									"page": 48,
									"entries": [
										"Dragonborn, as their name indicates, are born from dragons. They were created with the essence of dragons and look the most draconic out of all the humanoid draconic races. Like half dragons, the blood of a particular type of dragon runs strong through each dragonborn, granting additional traits.",
										"Despite this, most don't have a tail like the half dragons have, and those that do are often shunned due to it being considered a bad omen for dragonborn to have a tail. They are divided into subgroups based on the draconic fragments that they possess. Most are blessed with a powerful soul piercing roar, while others have developing wings. Regardless of their gifts, they have a reputation for being reliable and honorable.",
										"Their origins vary, but often they were created by dragons as shock troops and servants. Because of this dragonborn have mixed feelings towards dragons in general. A few take pride in their origin, but most hold a grudge against dragons as they were little more than slaves. Regardless of their stance on this, dragonborn pride themselves on their own skill and ability to take care of themselves, showing their worth through their own actions. As such, a continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the dragonborn race. They value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. And they make mastery of a particular skill their lifetime goal. Those half dragons that are raised by dragonborn communities usually have a similar mindset and will often strive even harder to prove their worth. To most dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position. Unlike half dragons, dragonborn live relative short lives, only around 80 years, but no less fulfilling ones.",

												"Dragonborn as a whole share a strong bond with half dragons, despite the origins of the latter. Even those dragonborn that hold the greatest grudge against dragons will often not extend this grudge to half dragons. This is likely due to the similarities that both races share, most of all how they similarly have draconic blood, and don't feel that this defines them similar to how it does not define themselves.",
												"They also tolerate the presence of kobolds, and even come to their defense when they are in trouble. Unless they deserve it, which is usually the case. Nonetheless, they respect the race it's devotion to their families and the group as a whole, and have grown to appreciate their skill at sewage management.",
												"They often get annoyed at the borderline worship that kobolds have for them, but generally tolerate it while simultaneously relying heavily upon their unorthodox skills and high numbers.",
												"Their opinion on the other races varies, as they tend to value people's skill and merit the most. Usually, they tend to get along with dwarves due to their strong senses of honor and duty. Humans are seen as both fascinating as well as dangerous, but overall they have a friendly relationship. They respect the skill of the Elves and the strong sense towards communities that halflings have. Gnomes are seen with a slightly less positive view due to their rivalry with the kobolds, to whom they have grown somewhat attached. But if a gnome proves its merit, it will often find a devoted ally and friend."

												"The dragonborn are the most organized of all the draconic races. This is because they were originally created as foot soldiers for true dragons, to fight in their many wars. Eventually many broke free, but they kept their military ways. Although dragonborn are divided within clans, all clans come together and form legions together, working under a council that was elected by the numerous clans. These are named the Ironscale Legions, and are a force to be reckoned with.",
												"These legions comprise mostly out of dragonborn, but also contain a large number of kobolds, who function as scouts and support, as well as half dragons who fill more specialized roles. True dragons however, due to the stigma that the dragonborn have against them, are generally not accepted within the ranks of a legion. Other humanoid races who are part of draconic communities, provided they prove their worth, may also become part of an Ironscale Legion. Usually these are mortal partners of half dragons, or simply races that have been absorbed within the draconic nation.",
												"Divine spellcasters are a touchy subject, because they believe that the gods created them to be slaves of the dragons. Because of this many dragonborn consider it taboo for dragonborn to worship the gods. Especially since they feel that one must prove themselves through their own skill and show their worth instead of worshiping gods. Nonetheless, within the Ironscale Legion the results are ultimately what matters.",
												"The Legion understands the use of healing and supportive magic, and as such dragonborn clerics are tolerated and even appreciated if they prove their worth. Though most divine spellcasters tend to be half dragons. Bards on the other hand are greatly appreciated within the ranks, both for their skill at healing as well as boosting the morale of the troops. Wizards and Sorcerers are also a fundamental part of a legion, as they suffer no taboo for their magic. After all, they learned how to wield magic themselves after either hard work, or because they were naturally talented, which are both traits that the dragonborn value."

												"The relationship that dragonborn have with the gods is a complicated one. Depending on your setting, this may also vary. In the forgotten realms setting, the dragonborn originate from Abeir, where they were servants and slaves of the dragons. Religion never took place on Abeir because the gods only existed on Toril, which is the main setting of the forgotten realms. Abeir was the planet of the primordials, where they ruled instead. On Abeir, no god would answer your prayers, so divine magic was largely useless there. The dragons eventually rose up against their former primordial masters, and eventually conquered most of the planet.",
												"Through this war they artificially created the dragonborn, as the perfect soldiers. They lived short lives compared to dragons, but they reproduced a lot faster, and were created in mass numbers. Some tried to fight off the tyranny of dragons, but most failed. During the spell plague, a large city of dragonborn was transported to Toril, and from here dragonborn were able to walk among humans and the many other races. This could be different for your setting, but they are generally former slaves of the dragons, and believe that the gods abandoned them to dragon kind. Nevertheless, they respect talented clerics for their support magic, and once they have proven their worth will generally always accept them. Among the newly accepted gods, Bahamut the platinum dragon has become the most popular."

										"Dragonforged are modified warforged, and considered the pinacle of dragonborn crafting. The creation of these dragonforged was commissioned by several legions, who sought to create loyal and stalwart sentries against enemies that relied heavily on ambush tactics and assassinations. These modifications include darkvision, a \"breath weapon\" which launches several metal shards, and a restoration system that allows them to be more easily revived after battle. However, this came at the cost of their specialized design, and their new restoration system had a significant flaw; it conflicted with their integrated protection, and limited restoration magic from sources other than itself, as the system saw those as an outside threat while the dragonforged was in combat. Nevertheless, this flaw was accepted as many saw it at as a way of self reliance, which is considered a great virtue among dragonborn. The legions considered the project a great success, as they became known as efficient sentries, guards, and vanguard. Once they gained sentience, the dragonborn openly welcomed them in their societies, due to the merit they had shown in their shared battles. Now these dragonforged must find their own place in this world, or they can remain in the service of their creators, which many do.",

										"Half dragons are the most \"human\" among the draconic races. They appear like humans, with scales and hair colors that match their most dominant draconic ancestor. They have a long scaly tail, scaled legs, and a few scales on their torso, arms, and face.",
										"In addition they have draconic horns sprouting from their heads, as well as draconic looking eyes. Half dragons are divided in subraces based on which draconic ancestor is the most dominant for them. Based on their ancestry, they are blessed with various benefits. But a powerful breath weapon is what they all have in common, even compared to that of the dragonborn.",
										"Half dragons are different from dragonborn in that they were not artificially created, but instead are born or are descended from unions between dragons and mortal partners. Metallic dragons are known for their ability to take on humanoid forms, especially silver dragons, whose love for humanity has caused them to create an entire human subrace; the silverbrow humans. However, dragons are magical creatures, and many are able to wield powerful magic (see the Dragons as Innate Spellcasters variant rule in the Monster Manual on page 86). As such many chromatic dragons have been able to create half dragon bloodlines of their own. Blue dragon particularly are known for creating many half dragon offspring, as a way of creating weaker soldiers that will be less likely to betray them. Interesting enough, despite being chromatic dragons, blue dragons are known for being loving parents to any of their children, dragon or half dragon. Half dragons possess less bestial traits than dragonborn, but possess undeniable potential and the possibility to \"ascend to dragonhood\". This grants the half dragon the ability to assume their true dragon form, and become a full-fledged dragon.",
										"In addition, half dragons live a lot longer than dragonborn, being able to live almost a millennium, and surpassing the age of elves. Despite this, they often have more children than elves do, and as such are a fast expending race, almost as fast as dragonborn. The only thing keeping this race in check from overwhelming areas are the many conflicts they tend to have. Not because they are necessarily violent (though in the case of some half dragon subraces this is indeed the case), but because they are a prideful race that doesn't shy away from a challenge and often meets it head on. Combined with the half dragon race its desire to become stronger and seek out challenges, they tend to live dangerous lives. In order to expand and increase their survival changes, half dragons usually spend the early parts of their long lives rearing and raising children, and will only adventure once they feel they have experienced this kind of life long enough, potentially leaving their current children into the care of their spouse or families. Their long lives allow them to experience both lifestyles, and it isn't uncommon for a half dragon adventurer to have children waiting at home, or to return to a life of family once their adventuring lives are behind them. However, despite their claims, their adventuring lives are never truly left behind, as their racial drive to become stronger often pushes them back into it once more. Despite this, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, and some start their lives as adventurers instead. The pull towards worthwhile challenges taking priority for them.",
										"Alongside half silver dragons and half blue dragons, half red dragons are among the most numerous of half dragons. This has baffled many scholars, as red dragons do not have the love for humanity that, silver dragons have, nor the organization and family bonds of blue dragons. On top of that red dragons are infamous for their pride and desire to make achievements without the help of others. And ironically, while the half red dragons have the strongest desire out of all the half dragons to become stronger, they do work very well together. They are known as sea coast raiders, who pillage while sailing their longboats. While this is partially true, there are also more peaceful half red dragon villages. The half red dragons generally believe that they were formerly human tribes, who sought to create more half red dragon tribesmen to give them an edge in their many wars. They did this through temporary forged alliances with red dragons, whom they bought with gold and treasure. Over time their dominant genes spread, creating entire tribes of half red dragons.",
										"There are also groups of half dragons that work together with their full-blooded kin. The most notable of those are the half silver dragons, who are often raised in human settlements by their silver dragon family. These children are often the result of the silver dragon's fascination with humans, resulting in unions that create half silver dragons. Another group are the half blue dragons, who were intentionally created by blue dragon families, as they sought to create plentiful and loyal troops to serve them. Despite this ulterior motive, blue dragons are surprisingly good parents, treating their half and full-blooded offspring with equal affection. This generally results in half blue dragons being loyal servants and agents of their families. Despite being chromatic dragons, blue dragons are more likely to be mocking and manipulative than outright cruel or murderous to \"lesser\" creatures, which is why they love using hallucinations on travelers. The family always goes first, even if it means defying Tiamat. Because the dragons themselves already provide the brute strength to their forces, half blue dragons often become Stormscales; specialized warriors who perform key tasks. These include taking out spellcasters, who often pose the biggest threat to their full-blooded kin, assassinating key leaders, or using their incredible speed to surprise foes and take them headon. These Stormscales are fiercely loyal to their fullblooded dragon kin, to the point that blue dragons even trust them enough to allow them to be hired by those with sufficient gold. They are greatly feared by even the most powerful of wizards, as more than one spell caster has met a grizzly demize at the hands of a Stormscale. Stormscale are also known as honorable in many cases, rewarding those that have provided a service to their cause. This seems strange to many due to their blue dragon heritage, as they generally worship Tiamat. Many speculate that they have this code of honor due to pragmatism, as it allows them the best results to persuade others, as they often have enough riches. However, if those that have gained freely gifted scales from a dragon (blue or otherwise), and requests that these scales are interweaved into light armor, most Stormscale will ensure that they find someone who can do that for them. Despite being honorable, Stormscale will pragmatically eliminate anyone who might pose a threat to their family.",

Dragonborn see half dragons as fundamentally different, despite the similarities, and that would explain their tolerance for their tails.",
												"Kobolds are often seen in an endearing way, thinking of them as comedic but still being respectful enough to them due to their usefulness. They will usually come to the defense of one because of this endearing feeling, unless the kobold deserves its misfortune which it often does. Half dragons can be annoyed with them from time to time. However, the kobold's valuable skills and devout worship makes these annoyances easier to overlook in the eyes of a half dragon.",
												"They tend to get along well with most other races, though the drive and ambition that humans often possess makes half dragons gravitate towards humans more often than not.

The subsequent turn of events differs on whether the myth's teller is a kobold or a gnome, but either way Garl Glittergold stumbled across Kurtulmak's cavern and pulled the trigger, burying the God of the kobolds in his own trap. The kobold version insists that Garl Glittergold did so because he was jealous of Kurtulmak's creation, whilst the gnomish version claims that Garl admired Kurtulmak's work and pulled the keystone out simply to see if it worked.",
										"The second story, as told by those kobolds that are more civilized, tells an entirely different tale: When Io gave the secret of creation to the first true dragons, the first dragon to use that secret was Caesinsjach, a green dragon. The first kobold was Kurtulmak. Caesinsjach chose to command her new creations through Kurtulmak; and he ascended to a position of leadership. When Caesinsjach told the kobolds to mine for precious metal, Kurtulmak invented the pickaxe When she ordered them to tile her lair with gold Kurtulmak Kurtulmak minted the first draconic coin. And when she told them to mine precious stones, Kurtulmak taught himself sorcery to divine where minerals were located. When Caesinsjach's lair was finished and she had become the wealthiest dragon in creation she let the kobolds go free. In emulation of his former mistress, Kurtulmak immediately began mining a lair for him-self. Although he never asked for help, every kobold he ever worked with came to his aid. Kurtulmak found a spot with a near limitless supply of metal ore and precious stones. With Kurtulmak commanding the operation, it quickly became the most structurally sound and resourcefully designed mine the world had ever seen. Kurtulmak called it Darastrixhurthi, a fortress fit for dragons. Nothing rivaled it. Garl Glittergold was not pleased. While his gnomes were playing useless games, the kobolds were busy working and were ready to emerge as a dominant race. And so with a wave of his hand, Garl collapsed Kurtulmak's mine, crushing all the kobolds inside. The other gods demanded an explanation but no deity came forward to reverse the damage done. Io, realizing that no god would help, found Kurtulmak still clinging to life. Even buried under the mountain he would not give up on his people. Io gave Kurtulmak a choice. He would empower Kurtulmak with the strength to rebuild the mine, or he would make the mighty kobold a champion of his people for all eternity. In this latter case, the loss of Darastrixhurthi would remain, but the memory of what happened would never be forgotten.",
										"All kobolds are far less fearful when fighting alongside their tribe, as they believe that when they die serving their tribe they will be reincarnated as the next egg laid in a hatchery. If a kobold dies serving its own need instead of those of the tribe, it gets reincarnated as the next pup born in the dire weasel stables. And if it betrays the tribe, it will reincarnate as a giant stag beetle. Those who die while sacrificing them-selves for the tribe are instead send to Kurtulmak's mine in heaven, and the most productive and loyal kobolds there will be reincarnated as dragons on the material plane. Those faithfully serving a dragon, without betraying their tribe, also gain these divine rewards. They live, they die, they live again.",

These dragonborn-raised half dragons hold mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal, alongside the desire to ascend to dragonhood. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn their respect.",

By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful. Such half dragons have \"ascended to dragonhood,\" and become true dragons with all their terrifying might.

Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families.
