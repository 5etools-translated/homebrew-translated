Familiar staples of the fantasy genre such as elves, dwarves, and orcs have been reimagined through the lens of Greek mythology and given a new place in this ancient, bronze age world.

Then they emerge from the forest, bringing revels to a returning army or farming village exhausted from long labor, rivers of wine to the thirsty, bounteous feasts to the hungry, and, when required, punishment to the rigid and oppressive, those rulers whose love of order and deprivation become too strong. Such druids are feared by tyrants across Arkadia, for there are tales of such wanderers\u2014Phaedrus themself in disguise\u2014who tear them down from their thrones and remind them what they are, often by turning them into whatever beast they seem most like, humiliating them and stripping them of power for their own good and the good of Arkadia.",

Many make a living as monster hunters, hired by kings and generals to take down fierce beasts when all others have failed. Oreyan elves have a proud ranger tradition, and some of the fiercest amazons are among their number.

								"Arkadian rogues are enterprising explorers, cunning leaders, and clever tacticians, endlessly seeking wealth and power no matter the odds. Invariably well-spoken, charming, and ingenious, tricksters hatch brilliant, daring schemes, turning from rags to riches and back again. Such rogues thrive in Illyria, a chaotic city of wealth and political intrigue, where they rule the noble houses, each seeking to outmaneuver the others. Many rogues hail from the Illyrian nobility themselves, or eventually find themselves caught up in their games, gravitating toward the status and coin they offer. Others are spread far and wide, earning the favor of kings and queens and directing events in their favor. Less politically inclined rogues become smugglers and tomb raiders, bandits and treasure hunters, sailing as far as distant Nys and Psysseria to bring back exotic, forbidden wares in defiance of the Ithean fleet.",
								"Rogues notoriously defy not only Arkadian law, to the consternation of Hyperium and its consuls, but the gods themselves, trusting their wit and cunning to see them through against any obstacle. Some devout rogues honor Lyria, sharing her love of gold, while even more honor Phaedrus, god of trickery and cunning, who delights in all their exploits whether they praise him or no.",

Thessa next, grey eyed, and wiser than her father still. Then Crixys dark; and Lyria, more beautiful than all the rest. Two children she had already, born of sky and stone, eldest of their kin. Oreya, fierce and cunning and Erebos, of stunted form, though undiminished in his skill.}",

At once they came, those creatures of unspoken names, and each a god befell. They did battle with the gods so great the earth trembled and the sky wheeled above... Each in turn was repelled. Wounded, bound, or killed, they were driven back to the corners of the world, to in darkness writhe.}",

Few mortals still hold the power in their veins, that power of the gods. With those gifts, Arkadia is ours to hold; an age of heroes and bronze.}",

High in the marble temple atop mount Hyperius, in days of old the Oracle gave prophecy: that ere the end there would come a day when the titans rise again, when the dead stir from silent sleep, when ancient wounds heal and chains break. The titans will rise again, and so it falls to us to drive them back\u2014we mortals, we children of the gods, we Arkadians.}"

From this stone and the teachings of the Scyllaean elves, those few who survived its cataclysmic end, Arkadians learned the arcane arts, those secrets of the gods. Some say the Scyllaean elves brought the stone as a gift when they fled their lost home. Philosophers have added to the stone over the centuries, carving onto it new spells they have learned. As such it represents the values of Ithea, knowledge, exploration, and magic.",

Some look upon their magic with disdain, such as the Krytans, though many welcome their schools.

With irresistible craft and beauty she beguiled mighty Krytos, fiercest of the gods, and by him gave birth to the gorgon, monstrous daughters twisted and cursed by the hubris of their mother. Enraged at her deception, Krytos drove her from Arkadia and sought to slay his accursed daughters.
