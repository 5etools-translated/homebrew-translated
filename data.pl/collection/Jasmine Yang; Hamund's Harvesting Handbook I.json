Jednakże, niektóre śmierci są bardziej gwałtowne niż inne i mogą sprawić, że zbieranie użytecznych materiałów będzie bardzo trudne lub wręcz niemożliwe. Takimi przykładami są spalenie przez ogień, rozpuszczenie przez kwas lub całkowite zmiażdżenie pod słupem kamiennym. W takich przypadkach podnieś DC dla zebrania jakichkolwiek materiałów tej istoty o 5. Alternatywnie, DM może zdecydować, że dobrze zaaranżowane polowanie skutkuje tuszą, która jest idealna do zebrania, jak np. stworzenia zabite głównie przez obrażenia psychiczne, lub te zabite w jednym czystym ataku. W takich przypadkach DM powinien obniżyć DC dla zebrania jakichkolwiek materiałów tego stworzenia o 5.",

Te ceny są przeznaczone tylko jako punkt odniesienia, a DM ma prawo dostosować te wartości według własnego uznania do kampanii.

Na przykład, nos może stać się haczykowaty, a ręce przypominać szpony. Co 24 godziny ofiara może ponownie spróbować rzutu ratunkowego. W przypadku sukcesu, choroba się kończy, a następnie co 24 godziny jedna przekształcona cecha wraca do normy. W przypadku porażki, inna cecha twarzy lub część ciała zmienia się na bardziej podobną do hagów, a choroba trwa nadal. Co 7 dni każda aktualnie przekształcona cecha staje się trwała, nawet po wyleczeniu choroby.
