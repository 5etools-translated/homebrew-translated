Marble golems can be disguised as normal statues, but they come alive under certain conditions. For example, it might attack trespassers who enter a room without speaking the proper password. They can also activate on a command word from their designated master.",
					"Narcissistic Spirits. Marble golems are animated by spirits plucked from the elemental planes and forcibly bound into artificial bodies. The spirits unwittingly attracted to these particular constructs are always vain, and golem builders take advantage of their conceited natures when weaving the necessary binding spells. As long as the spirit finds its new form and surroundings suitably beautiful, it is much less likely to break free from its master's control. Great care is therefore given to ensuring that marble golems are displayed in such a way that their beauty is emphasized and respected.",
					"Relentless Pursuit. A marble golem usually stop its attacks once an enemy has fled. However, if the marble golem has had its beauty marred, the spirit inside will become enraged. The golem will become relentless in its desire to track down and kill whoever damaged it. While the golem doesn't have any magical ability to track the object of its hatred, it can follow footprints, and it will interrogate (or destroy) anyone who stands in its way."

					"Infatuation. Cyclopes often become infatuated with members of the fey races. This infatuation is doomed to end in tragedy, for the fey look upon cyclopes as ugly brutes. The best that a cyclops can hope for is to become a servant, to be used and manipulated.",
					"Arms and Armor. Most cyclopes wear ill-fitted clothing and barbaric weapons, but others are more lucky. These cyclopes wear finely-crafted weapons and armor that have been provided by a powerful patron.",
					"Cyclopes with Superior Equipment",
					"A cyclops with a powerful patron wears splint mail, a shield, and a warhammer. These cyclopes have AC 19. Especially powerful cyclopes might wield mauls that inflict 29 (6d6 +8) bludgeoning damage with every attack.",
					"Blemys",
					"Blemys are cyclopes that have no heads. Instead, they have a single great cyclopean eye, along with a nose and a mouth, in the center of their chests. The blemys are cursed cyclops who live alone, filled with anger and bitterness. Their simmering anger often boils over during battle, making them an even more fearsome foe.",
					"Something to Prove. Despite their almost comical appearance, blemys are formidable foes. Underestimating their capabilities can lead to an untimely death. A blemys that does not receive due and proper deference from weaker creatures will demonstrate its giant strength by tearing such disrespectful foes apart. Blemys are frequently assumed to be unintelligent due to their lack of a cranium, and many non-blemys believe, incorrectly, that they are literally brainless. In fact, blemys are the most intelligent type of cyclops. They can outwit the average mortal settler, just as they outwitted their civilized cousins, the gygans, in ages past. The best strategy to avoid conflict with a blemys is to challenge it to a battle of wits. Letting the blemys win and then begging for mercy may be flattering enough for it to spare the loser's life. If a blemys is beaten by an obviously superior intellect, its humiliation will likely drive it to attack in a fit of rage. In such situations, opponents can take advantage of the blemys' limited field of view. If a dexterous and observant individual avoids the blemys' extreme tunnel vision for long enough, then it may be convinced that its quarry has escaped and give up its search in tearful frustration.",
					"Nomadic Lifestyle. Blemys' prickly personalities and antisocial tendencies prevent these creatures from forming communities. They live by raiding poorly-defended settlements for food and other goods, and given the opportunity, they may even steal from their own kindred. As a result, blemys often find themselves wandering alone, as they are quickly driven from an area once survivors of their raids recover and organize.",
					"Uncertain Origins. The origin of these outlandish cyclopes is unknown. Some scholars believe that their condition is a divine curse. Blemys progenitors may have comprised a civilization of particularly intelligent, charismatic, and social cyclopes that were uncharacteristically prone to vanity. This, possibly combined with the nonreligious nature of most cyclopes, attracted the attention of cruel gods who decided to punish them for their pride and narcissism. Robbed of their good looks and affluence, the blemys' civilization quickly collapsed, driving their descendants into lonely lives of perpetual dissatisfaction."

					"Gygans are six-armed giants with a single eye. It is rumored that they are descended from an ancient cyclopean race that was spawned by the gods and thrived millennia ago. Their civilization of city-states competed in great gaming competitions with an emphasis on boxing and wrestling. Sometimes these games could devolve into outright warfare. With the decline of their once great civilization, gygans now live together in small family groups or sometimes alone.",
					"Civilized. Unlike typical cyclopes, gygans echo their once-great civilization in their current lives. Instead of a city-state comprised of a single grand metropolis and the surrounding area, the gygans of today form groups based around a powerful family. A gygan community begins with a grand founder family estate that is built up over time, that attracts solitary gygans and mates from other family groups. These newcomers construct their own homes nearby, creating patches of relatively secure farmland between estates. Gygans within these family groups cooperate to produce food, wine, clothing, art, and entertainment. These self-sustaining communities rarely interact with non-gygans. Consequently, each insular family group develops a distinct culture that may be lost completely if disaster strikes the community. Some gygan family groups have become so isolated that their members speak dialects not intelligible to other speakers of giant or common, including other gygans in the same area.",
					"Superb Athletes. The six arms of a gygan gives it unparalleled athletic prowess. They combine strength with agility and are fearsome warriors due to their ability to use multiple weapons and shields. They can also grapple opponents with their extra arms in order to pin them down before finishing them off."

Like many monstrous magical creatures, medusae become more formidable with age, as they gain in both raw power and the wisdom to master that power.

Its previous, weak humanoid body has been replaced with a massive snake-like torso, and its muscular, scaly arms possess strength rivaling a hill giant. The euryale's serpentine body can encircle and crush smaller creatures with ease. Barbed, venomous quills line the bodies of some euryales, and these quills can be detached and used as arrows to strike at foes that stand out of reach. Despite this grotesque bodily transformation, the euryale's face continues to be eternally young and beautiful, if somewhat unsettling.

In other cases, capricious beings may transform the medusa for no better reason than their own amusement, hoping to unleash chaos upon the Material Plane. The rare euryale that does not consent to this change often goes mad, leaving its lair to seek vengeance upon whichever unfortunate souls it happens to encounter."

Architects of wild beauty, nymphs are bound to, and protect, the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains, and seas they shape and call home. Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.",
					"Enigmatic Values. All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.",
					"Secluded Surroundings. Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.",
					"Ephemeral Lovers. Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.",
					"Types of Nymphs",
					"Nymphs are divided into six subraces: dryads of the forests, naiads of lakes and rivers, nereids of the oceans, oreads of the mountains, oceanids of the islands, and aurae of the night sky.",
					"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.",
					"Nymph Lairs",
					"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.",
					"Lair Actions",
					"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nymph can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:",
					"• The nymph glimpses the future, so that it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.",
					"• The nymph merges with her surroundings and reappears anywhere in her lair. This ability functions exactly like dimension door except that it requires no components and the range is limited to within the nymph's lair.",
					"Regional Effects",
					"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.",
					"• Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.",
					"• Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.",
					"Aurae",
					"Aurea are nymphs associated with the sea and the night sky, currents, breezes, and the constellations. Each aurae claims an island for her home, and she guards it with fearsome devotion. The most territorial of the nymphs, aurae have taken it upon themselves to stem the tide of civilization and do not tolerate mortals on their islands. They are not malicious or cruel, and they always give trespassers fair warning to leave. But if their words go unheeded, they will not hesitate to smite interlopers with all their power.",
					"Aurae sometimes become muses for mortals. These nymphs have an innate fascination with words and language, and thrill in the abilities of poets, storytellers, and lyricists. Some of history's greatest songs, poems, and tales are thought to have been inspired by aurae.",
					"Like other nymphs, aurae can charm others to fight for them, but they also wield great strength, both physical and magical. In battle, aurae weave fey magic into beautiful songs to lull their opponents to sleep and to inflict psychic harm through vivid nightmares."

Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.",
					"Enigmatic Values. All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.",
					"Secluded Surroundings. Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.",
					"Ephemeral Lovers. Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.",
					"Types of Nymphs",
					"Nymphs are divided into six subraces: dryads of the forests, naiads of lakes and rivers, nereids of the oceans, oreads of the mountains, oceanids of the islands, and aurae of the night sky.",
					"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.",
					"Nymph Lairs",
					"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.",
					"Lair Actions",
					"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nymph can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:",
					"• The nymph glimpses the future, so that it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.",
					"• The nymph merges with her surroundings and reappears anywhere in her lair. This ability functions exactly like dimension door except that it requires no components and the range is limited to within the nymph's lair.",
					"Regional Effects",
					"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.",
					"• Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.",
					"• Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.",
					"Naiad",
					"Nymphs of fresh water, naiads make their homes in lakes, streams, brooks, and wetlands. Naiads are the nymphs that are most likely to come into contact with mortals.",
					"Humans need to be close to reliable sources of fresh water, and this frequently creates an overlap between the domains of mortals and naiads. Some naiads even choose to live in man-made structures, such as fountains and wells, if they deem them beautiful enough to call home. Although naiads are often very curious about the mortal world, their patience for the ugly noise and bustle of cities remains short.",
					"Naiads are coveted by mortals for both their great beauty and their talents. They often have the ability to divine the fate of mortals. They have been known to use this power to shape history, as mysterious oracles and advisors. Naiads also serve as muses to great artists and musicians, taking them to a level of creativity that only supernatural assistance can inspire. Thanks to these abilities, powerful mortals frequently fall in love with naiads, and they are the most likely of all nymphs to give birth to mortal children with grand destinies."

					"Nereids are beautiful female fey that dwell beneath the ocean waves. There, they fiercely defend coral reefs and all natural life that dwell within it. Although quick swimmers in their own right, nereids often seek the aid of dolphin or seahorse mounts to bolster their effectiveness in battle. Nereids are as attached to such creatures as paladins are to their steeds; should the animal fall in battle, its rider may be overcome by grief. Each nereid wields her own personal trident, which is grown from the same coral they protect. Although they are dangerous when threatened, nereid sightings are considered to be a portent of good luck for sailors. Wise captains know to steer clear of their reefs, so as to avoid damaging them with the ship's anchor. In addition to their skill as warriors, nereids are also well known for their exquisite voices, which can travel through water undistorted. Unlike the songs of many other aquatic fey, nereids do not weave enchantments into their music; they sing for beauty's sake.",
					"Benthic Beauties. Nereids are sometimes mistaken for merfolk at first glance. They possess streamlined, slightly alien features that are as striking as they are beautiful. Diaphanous webbing connects the fingers and toes of a nereid, and their slick skin resembles that of a dolphin, albeit in various shades of blue and green. Some nereids have additional fish-like traits, such as visible gills and fins that run along their limbs and back, though this aspect of their anatomy is highly variable, depending on their tribe.",
					"Guiding the Lost. Many nereids display a level of benevolence towards humanoids that is rare among fey. Nereids have been known to shepherd lost sailors safely back to civilization, provided that they show adequate respect for nature. Some nereids even establish long-term relationships with the sailors who frequent their waters, steering their ships away from the sea's many hidden dangers.",
					"Defenders of Reefs. Nereids are bound to protect a specific coral reef, just as dryads are bound to their forests. Overtly hostile nereids are rare, and they usually do not discourage the intrusion of mortals into their domains. However, visitors should be wary to not mistake their relatively kind natures for softness; should their homes be at all harmed or threatened, nereids retaliate en-masse with a piranha-like tenacity, giving no quarter to their prey."

They are most well known for their fascination with humanoids and largely take on forms that mimic handsome male members of these races. Oceanids adore beauty of all kinds but personally lack subtlety. They are invariably flashy, dressing in brightly-colored clothing and heavily adorning themselves in jewelry.",
					"Mutable Shapes. Oceanids are shapeshifters who typically take forms that are almost physically indistinguishable from male humanoids. An oceanid rarely assumes a single guise for more than a month or two at a time, but he may revisit an identity later on. Many bear minor tells that go largely unnoticed, such as too-green eyes or sweat that smells too closely of ocean brine. Though they may lack \"true forms,\" oceanids sometimes also appear as creatures akin to water elementals, albeit in a closer approximation of human shape.",
					"Tricksters of the Shore. Oceanids spend much of their time tricking and playing pranks upon mortals. These tricks are usually harmless, but they can be infuriating. A common example of an oceanid prank is to exchange jewelry for other valuable trinkets\u2014items that soon crumble into sand once the oceanid takes his leave. However, some oceanid pranks can turn fatal, often in the form of drownings. In another favorite oceanid prank, the oceanid lures his target into dangerous currents with illusory calm waters. Although some oceanids are indeed malicious, any deaths resulting from their pranks are usually unintentional. Oceanids can be poor judges of mortal swimming ability and lead victims to their dooms in their ignorance. When such a fate befalls an object of an oceanid's affections, he may become so overcome with grief that he dissolves into seafoam.",
					"Consummate Musicians. Like many fey creatures, oceanids have a fondness for music and are skilled players of lutes, lyres, and other stringed instruments. Many oceanids delight in sharing their expertise with humanoids, and their pupils often go on to become famous bards. Although not always a means of enchantment, some oceanids use their songs to magically attract mortals to the shore. Such lures are often necessary, as oceanids begin to lose their mental faculties if they stray too far inland. However, their intentions for doing so vary: one oceanid may simply want an audience, while another may seek to draw in new victims for his pranks."

This monster is the result of a cruel curse bestowed by the gods upon merfolk and other aquatic humanoids, usually as punishment for severe transgressions. As a result of their loathsome origins, most merfolk look upon ichthyses with utter disgust, and the creatures become outcast from merfolk societies. Doomed to aimlessly wander the seafloor, the ichthys becomes consumed by the desire to search for victims as outlets for its unrelenting pain and anger The only joys it knows are those of torture and senseless bloodshed. Most ichthyses continue to wield the same weapons they did before their transformation. Hence, the creatures tend to favor tridents and other implements used by merfolk.",
					"Tortured Forms. An ichthys's body is racked with perpetual pain, and any attempts at quick movement are especially agonizing. This state is a product of the strain put upon crustacean anatomy that is not designed to support heavy humanoid torsos. Despite its incompatible physiologies, the body of an ichthys continues to function by way of the curse's magic. Pain and poor balance create a plodding, awkward gait paired with a relatively slow swimming speed.",
					"Macabre Artists. Although largely nomadic, ichthyses set up temporary camps on the seafloor. There, an ichthys uses the bodies of its victims as bait to draw the attentions of both food and other humanoids. An ichthys arranges these corpses to create grotesque sculpture gardens. It often begins to \"sculpt\" its subjects when they are still alive, tying them in place before further carving into their flesh. An ichthys will sometimes leave a victim half dead, as their feeble attempts at escape make for an excellent lure."

					"Birthplace of Monsters. Scylla originates from Typhon, an island whose magical energies birth countless other hybrid abominations, including chimeras and manticores. However, Scylla is Typhon's worst \"child\" by far, both in form and the amount of damage she wreaks. Some legends claim that Scylla was once a beautiful nymph who was imprisoned on Typhon for countless years. Over time, its corruption slowly twisted her body and mind into the monstrosity she is today. By the time she was strong enough to break free of her bonds, any semblance of the nymph she was had long been replaced by hunger and madness."

Many who face the creature never come close to seeing the end of its tail, as the sea serpent's body reaches hundreds of feet in length. The sea serpent is so large that its back creates the illusion of a chain of islands as it slithers through the waves. Often mistaken as a dragon due to its massive size, the sea serpent is actually descended from gargantuan, primordial snakes.",

Assuming it has found a feast, the sea serpent wraps its coils around the vessel and squeezes until it becomes a splintered wreck. From there, it proceeds to attempt to swallow the structure whole\u2014unless it is distracted by attacks from the ship's occupants.",
					"Surviving the Serpent. Anyone wishing to fight a sea serpent should make killing the beast one's sole priority. Wounding the monster only makes it redouble its efforts in a fit of rage, and it always fights to the death. In the unlikely event that a creature survives the sea serpent's bite, the creature is nonetheless doomed, as the serpent will inevitably swallow any prey that it catches in its jaws. If swallowed whole, a victim is likely to only live a few minutes before being dissolved by the serpent's powerful stomach acid.",
					"Monster of the Depths. The sea serpent prefers to stay in deep waters. Its massive size makes maneuvering in the shallows difficult and across any appreciable amount of land impossible. Additionally, the creature bears a deep hatred of the sound of thunder and will dive deep to avoid electrical storms."

Very few creatures can successfully sneak past a cerebus hound that guards a doorway or treasure. Tortured by Hags. Hags train these creatures through abuse designed to instill fear and rage. No hound in their charge is ever shown affection, and they are kept either in total isolation or attached to chains too short to allow the pups to comfort each other. Large groups of cerberus hounds are sometimes given very little food, in order to identify weaker dogs for culling. The hags then sew shut the mouths of the runts and encourage their former packmates to devour them. The hags also present the hounds with captive humanoids, bound and mutilated, in order to give them a taste for blood.",

The death dogs acknowledge the cerebus as the pack alpha. Whenever a cerebus dies, the death dogs fight for primacy. The victor devours the losers, and over the course of a month, it grows a new head, becoming a new cerebus to replace the original.",

Once they have been set to guard something, they never tire of their charge, even should hundreds of years pass without incident. Most hounds keep piles of their victims' bones as beloved trophies to gnaw on. Although the hound does require sleep, it rarely succumbs to the urge, and only one of its heads sleeps at any given time.",

					"Dread beasts are hulking undead animals raised by Lutheria, Mistress of Death and Lady of Dreams. These creatures typify both of her domains, as these twisted mockeries of life are nightmarish indeed. Dread beasts engage in few\u2014if any\u2014of the behaviors they did in life and are almost universally driven to slaughter any humanoid they encounter. While most of these creatures lurk in the hidden, barely-trod corners of the world, others conduct nocturnal raids against villages and other civilized communities. After it has been raised, a dread beast continues to rot, creating a nauseating odor that is sometimes pungent enough to poison living creatures unlucky enough to be in its vicinity. Although the creature's flesh festers and falls away, this process does nothing to diminish its considerable strength. When a dread beast survives long enough, it eventually becomes little more than a skeleton, held together only by the will of powerful dark magic.",
					"Monstrous Forms. Dread beasts are typically many times larger than their living counterparts. This gigantism is often due to the fact that dread beasts are frequently created from the remains of legendary mythic beasts. However, others are an amalgamation of multiple mundane animals. For example, many dread wolves have been stitched together from the flesh of entire packs.",
					"Tenacious Hunters. Some dread beasts are bound directly as servants of Lutheria and stand as guardians of things that the Titan holds dear. Others behave like revenants, hunting down and slaughtering their killers. Those created from mythic beasts are more likely to exhibit the latter behavior, frequently harassing heroes and adventuring parties.",
					"Withering Maws. A dread beast can lash out at its enemies using the necrotic energy that sustains it. A bite from one of these monster drains the life force from its victim, and the resulting wound is highly susceptible to infection\u2014assuming the victim survives the encounter.",
					"Dread Boar",
					"Usually created from the remains of great boar of legends, dread boar lumber across the plains of the underworld and on the peripheries of civilization. Although still more intelligent than the average mundane boar, great boar are largely stripped of their cunning when they become dread beasts, leaving them husks of their former selves. Dread boar often haunt cemeteries where they desecrate the tombs and grave markers of mortals who have displeased their mistress.",
					"Traveling Miasma. The stench that cloaks a dread boar is even stronger than of other dread beasts. This is partly due to the creature's filthy, gore-caked tusks. Rather than being relegated solely to the creature's mouth, the necrotic black discharge that makes a dread beast's bite so deadly oozes continuously over the dread boar's deadly tusks.",
					"Voracious Appetites. Dread boar are driven by an insatiable hunger that is a far greater threat to the civilized world than their murderous tempers. A single dread boar can devour entire fields of crops and herds of livestock in a matter of hours. If left unchecked and allowed to encroach upon humanoid settlements, a dread boar makes short work of all available food stores, leaving the residents to starve. Lutheria sometimes personally sends these creatures to plague prosperous cities she believes have not offered her adequate sacrifices."

					"Dread beasts are hulking undead animals raised by Lutheria, Mistress of Death and Lady of Dreams. These creatures typify both of her domains, as these twisted mockeries of life are nightmarish indeed. Dread beasts engage in few\u2014if any\u2014of the behaviors they did in life and are almost universally driven to slaughter any humanoid they encounter. While most of these creatures lurk in the hidden, barely-trod corners of the world, others conduct nocturnal raids against villages and other civilized communities. After it has been raised, a dread beast continues to rot, creating a nauseating odor that is sometimes pungent enough to poison living creatures unlucky enough to be in its vicinity. Although the creature's flesh festers and falls away, this process does nothing to diminish its considerable strength. When a dread beast survives long enough, it eventually becomes little more than a skeleton, held together only by the will of powerful dark magic.",
					"Monstrous Forms. Dread beasts are typically many times larger than their living counterparts. This gigantism is often due to the fact that dread beasts are frequently created from the remains of legendary mythic beasts. However, others are an amalgamation of multiple mundane animals. For example, many dread wolves have been stitched together from the flesh of entire packs.",
					"Tenacious Hunters. Some dread beasts are bound directly as servants of Lutheria and stand as guardians of things that the Titan holds dear. Others behave like revenants, hunting down and slaughtering their killers. Those created from mythic beasts are more likely to exhibit the latter behavior, frequently harassing heroes and adventuring parties.",
					"Withering Maws. A dread beast can lash out at its enemies using the necrotic energy that sustains it. A bite from one of these monster drains the life force from its victim, and the resulting wound is highly susceptible to infection\u2014assuming the victim survives the encounter.",
					"Dread Wolf",
					"The relentless dread wolves track their prey with unerring precision. Once a dread wolf has smelled the blood of a living creature, it tirelessly pursues its quarry. Occasionally, dread wolves are used as hunting \"dogs\" by more intelligent monsters on the trail of particularly elusive human champions.",
					"Glare of the Grave. The baleful glow of a dread wolf's eyes has the power to shake the nerves of even the most valiant warrior. This is not merely a reaction to the creature's repulsive appearance but rather a manifestation of the dread wolf's inner malevolence. The dread wolf is therefore able to use this ability at the most opportune time, focusing its enmity to invoke great fear in only its chosen targets.",
					"Strange Origins. Although most dread wolves have been fashioned from the corpses of ordinary wolves, humanoids are occasionally selected to transform into these creatures upon death. Those so chosen are invariably evil and were often werewolves or prolific murderers\u2014or both\u2014in life. Ever a cruel goddess, Lutheria has been known to bestow this \"gift\" to her worshippers."

The typical cetus memorizes every topographical detail in its territory, allowing it to easily herd opponents into dead ends while also avoiding areas that are unable to accommodate its massive bulk.",

This make cetea frequently mistaken for undead monsters, though they are actually believed to be fiendish in nature."

					"The nuckle is one of the most horrific undead abominations to terrorize the mortal realm. From a distance, the nuckle resembles a human rider upon a horse. Closer inspection, however, reveals a creature that could not possibly be mistaken as such. The nuckle resembles a rotting corpse with its humanoid lower torso fused to the back of an equine form that makes up the majority of the creature's body. A single oversized eye stares out from the center of the nuckle's bulbous head, and it grasps at its victims with clawed hands attached to spindly, too-long arms. However, the most noteworthy aspect of the nuckle may be its raw pink flesh, which evokes the appearance of person who has been severely burned or flayed alive.",
					"A Titan's Scourge. The nuckle is said to be created by Lutheria, the Goddess of Death, with the singular purpose of haunting the civilized world and tormenting those who dwell within it. Although the sea is the creature's true home, the nuckle regularly rises from the depths to plague coastal cities and towns, bringing death and misfortune in its wake. A nuckle's preferred manner of attack is to grab a victim and drag them into the sea on its back in a manner that makes the victim appear to be riding into the water on horseback. The nuckle may disappear beneath the waves for years at a time, only to rise and wreak havoc during a months-long rampage.",
					"Bringer of Decay. Black poison pumps through a nuckle's veins, which pours out of its slit-like nostrils in the form of noxious fumes. This toxic cloud threatens all forms of life, wilting crops and sickening livestock. Animals that survive the nuckle's poisonous breath are often driven mad and compelled to dash themselves upon rocky cliffs or drown themselves in the sea.",
					"Cleansing Water. As formidable as the nuckle is, the monster does have its weaknesses. Chief among these is large amounts of pure fresh water. If the nuckle is drenched with enough fresh water, its body swells up and bursts, destroying the creature. To protect itself, the nuckle uses its magic to cause devastating droughts. However, this ability weakens the farther it strays from the sea. Brave heroes wishing to vanquish a nuckle often lure it as far inland as possible by burning seaweed. The stench of the resulting smoke has the power to enrage the nuckle to the point where it abandons all sense of self-preservation, as it is driven to find the source. Strong caution should be taken when using this strategy, however, as it is prone to backfiring; the nuckle destroys any settlements unfortunate enough to exist between it and the target of its fury."

					"NYMPHS",
					"Nymphs are powerful fey who embody the splendor of the natural world. Architects of wild beauty, nymphs are bound to, and protect, the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains, and seas they shape and call home. Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.",
					"Enigmatic Values. All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.",
					"Secluded Surroundings. Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.",
					"Ephemeral Lovers. Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.",
					"Types of Nymphs",
					"Nymphs are divided into six subraces: dryads of the forests, naiads of lakes and rivers, nereids of the oceans, oreads of the mountains, oceanids of the islands, and aurae of the night sky.",
					"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.",
					"Nymph Lairs",
					"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.",
					"Lair Actions",
					"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nymph can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:",
					"• The nymph glimpses the future, so that it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.",
					"• The nymph merges with her surroundings and reappears anywhere in her lair. This ability functions exactly like dimension door except that it requires no components and the range is limited to within the nymph's lair.",
					"Regional Effects",
					"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.",
					"• Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.",
					"• Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.",
					"Oread",
					"As the most airy of the nymphs, in demeanor and their chosen domains, oreads are reclusive creatures associated with mountains, skies, and clouds. They are mischievous and selfish, even by fey standards, and one of their favorite pastimes is to take a mortal lover to \"paradise.\" The lover is only returned to the mortal realm a century or more later, once their families and friends are all dead and gone. This is not always deliberate on the part of the oread\u2014they simply don't give very much thought to the consequences of their actions on the lives of the mortals they beguile.",
					"Fey Hunters. Strangely, unlike dryads and most other fey creatures, oreads are consummate hunters. Mortals with exceptional hunting skills are not punished for killing animals on an oread's land, and may even be rewarded with a boon to improve their prowess. However, oreads take offense at mortal hunters who lack finesse. They are known to transform poor or needlessly cruel hunters into game animals as retribution for sullying their territory.",
					"Territorial and Possessive. Oreads are by far the most territorial of all nymphs. They may suffer mortal trespassers in their lands for a time, but always with the understanding that their sovereignty over that land must be honored and reaffirmed. They expect visiting mortals to make offerings of food and wine at shrines along the roads\u2014failing to do so many provoke the oread into hunting trespassers as game. Additionally, if an oread takes a romantic interest in a mortal who passes through his territory, he may claim that mortal as his \"pet.\""

They are sustained only by an appetite for destruction so vast that even if they were to destroy the world itself, they would still be unsatisfied. In such an event, the victorious behemoth would simply seek new worlds to destroy, drifting through space for aeons until it discovers a new focus for its unquenchable rage."
