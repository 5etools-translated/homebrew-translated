						"Jak wielu graczy, od najmłodszych lat jesteśmy przepełnieni kreatywnością. Kreatywne pisanie, poezja, sztuka i muzyka zawsze odgrywały dużą rolę w naszym życiu, ale to właśnie podczas naszych nastoletnich lat wszystkie te talenty i pasje zostały rozpalone do ognistej burzy emocji, kiedy usiedliśmy do naszej pierwszej sesji Dungeons & Dragons. Choć wtedy nie wiedzieliśmy, że ta pierwsza gra będzie doświadczeniem zmieniającym życie. Od prawie dwóch dekad tworzymy postaci i przeżywamy fantastyczne przygody, z których każda jest bardziej ekscytująca od poprzedniej!",
						"Kiedy najnowsza wersja D&D trafiła na półki sklepowe, z chęcią ją wypróbowaliśmy. Byliśmy częścią procesu beta testów i widzieliśmy wiele nowych i ciekawych zasad, które pojawiły się na scenie. Podobał nam się Starter Set, a każdy z podręczników z zasadami podstawowymi wzięliśmy do ręki jak tylko były dostępne. Przez rok spotykaliśmy się co tydzień, a czasem codziennie, na sesjach gry, podczas których eksplorowaliśmy niebezpieczne lochy, stawialiśmy czoła niepokonanym hordom, walczyliśmy ze śmiertelnymi wrogami i pokonywaliśmy monstrualne bestie. Po drodze straciliśmy kilku członków, ale ich imiona zostaną zapamiętane, gdy będziemy wspominać przez lata epickie przygody, które razem przeżyliśmy.",
						"Ten właśnie temat skłonił nas wszystkich do przemyśleń. Jak możemy pomóc społeczności graczy, zarówno Mistrzom Gry jak i Graczom, aby czerpać jak najwięcej z ich doświadczenia w grze? Odpowiedź na to pytanie nie była łatwa. Jest już tak wiele doskonałych materiałów, czego gracze potrzebują, a co jeszcze nie istnieje?",
						"Odpowiedź przyszła całkiem naturalnie pewnej nocy podczas sesji gry, kiedy nasz Mistrz Gry odchodził nieco od scenariusza i potrzebował nieplanowanego NPC do interakcji z graczami. Stworzenie NPC z tego co miał do dyspozycji zajęło mu więcej czasu niż zwykle, a po kilku rolkach miał wystarczająco dużo, ale niewiele więcej. Nie było żadnej historii, żadnej prawdziwej osobowości poza stereotypem opartym na rasie i płci.",
						"Natychmiast dostrzegliśmy potrzebę stworzenia księgi zasobów, która jeszcze nie istniała: księgi wypełnionej postaciami niezależnymi, które miałyby coś więcej niż tylko imię, rasę i klasę. Księga, która mogłaby zostać użyta przez Mistrza Gry do zapełnienia tawerny, punktu handlowego lub sali bankietowej. Alternatywnie, księga ta mogłaby być użyta przez Graczy do stworzenia początkowych postaci, lub do obserwacji progresji postaci, lub do stworzenia postaci na późniejszych poziomach, jeśli przyjdą późno do przygody, a reszta postaci Graczy ma już kilka poziomów.",
						"Robiliśmy burze mózgów i współpracowaliśmy, widząc jak nasze zadanie rozwija się przed nami. Nie będzie to łatwe zadanie, ale nic, co warto zrobić, nigdy nie jest. Wszyscy to wiemy; nasze lata gier fabularnych udowodniły to wielokrotnie. Nie możesz po prostu wejść i zabić smoka, potrzeba planowania, przygotowania, talentu i pracy zespołowej, aby wykonać najtrudniejsze zadania. Więc to właśnie zrobiliśmy."

Czy to podczas przygotowań do gry, czy też w trakcie gry, będziesz mógł wyciągnąć z niej postacie niezależne, które pomogą, przeszkodzą lub rzucą wyzwanie Twoim graczom. Książka jest podzielona na trzy duże sekcje - Postacie o dobrym nastawieniu, Postacie o neutralnym nastawieniu i Postacie o złym nastawieniu. Każda z tych części jest zrozumiała i zawiera dziesięć unikalnych postaci, które zostały szczegółowo opisane z historią, cechami, wskazówkami dotyczącymi gry, działaniami i przedmiotami. Dbałość o szczegóły podczas tworzenia postaci i procesu pisania pozwala zaoszczędzić czas podczas procesu przygotowania i sesji gry.",
								"Masz dostęp do 30 całkowicie unikalnych postaci niezależnych na sześciu różnych poziomach, co w efekcie daje 180 różnych postaci niezależnych do wykorzystania podczas kampanii lub sesji gry.

Ta książka rozwiązuje oba dylematy, dostarczając Graczom punkt wyjścia, punkty środkowe i punkt końcowy dla każdej postaci.",
								"Dzięki temu możliwe jest nie tylko zduplikowanie NPC dla postaci 1 poziomu, ale także użycie NPC wyższego poziomu jako własnej postaci w przypadku, gdy potrzebujesz postaci wyższego poziomu. Wszystkie ich atrybuty, umiejętności, cechy, przedmioty, broń i inne mechaniki zostały już obliczone i zoptymalizowane.

								"Czy istnieje jakieś zwierzę bardziej lojalne niż kruk? Nie, jeśli zapytasz któregoś z członków tej gildii. To, co zaczęło się w starożytności jako organizacja posłańców na osobisty użytek króla, z biegiem pokoleń stało się czymś więcej. Wkrótce Kruki stały się stowarzyszeniem skrybów, trenerów ptaków i posłańców, których jedynym celem było szerzenie wiedzy.",
								"Ich celem było szybkie rozprzestrzenianie wiadomości w całym królestwie z korzyścią dla wszystkich, ale jak to często bywa, ich moc została wkrótce wykorzystana do ciemnych celów. Król używał Kruków jako platformy do szerzenia propagandy i potępiania tych grup, które się mu sprzeciwiały lub źle o nim mówiły.",
								"Przywódcy Kruków, którzy nie zgodzili się na rozpowszechnianie królewskich wiadomości, zostali uwięzieni, a pozostali uczeni w Piśmie, zmuszeni do pisania falsyfikatów, spiskowali razem. Pozostała wśród nich starszyzna postanowiła opuścić służbę królowi i zamiast tego prowadzić życie w odosobnieniu i tajemnicy. Nie będą już żyć w luksusie w pałacu. Ich oddanie szerzeniu prawdy i wiedzy doprowadziło do wspólnego porozumienia o porzuceniu luksusu w środku nocy.",
								"Król był wściekły, gdy dotarła do niego wiadomość, że jego uczeni w piśmie zniknęli. Przeklął ich imiona i zażądał książęcego okupu za ich schwytanie, ale poszukiwania okazały się bezowocne. Wszyscy skrybowie przyjęli nowe imiona i historie i osiedlili się w nowych miastach, tak daleko jak tylko mogli.",
								"Teraz, po kilkudziesięciu latach, szepty i plotki o Krukach zaczęły pojawiać się przy stołach w lokalnych karczmach. Wiadomości przekazywane są za pomocą małych notatek, często przenoszonych na kostce wytrenowanego kruka. Ci, którzy potrafią pisać, rozpowszechniają je wśród tych, którzy mówią tylko w języku potocznym.",

								"Czerwone Rękawice mają długą i nikczemną historię. Pierwotnie była to arystokratyczna grupa, której przewodził niejaki Hammonder Strattenbury, bogaty właściciel ziemski w królestwie. On i jego wyborcy byli często zapraszani na wytworne spotkania zarezerwowane dla szlachty i ziemiaństwa. Powód był prosty: kontrolował ogromne połacie ziemi doskonałe do uprawy, a choć nie każdy potrzebuje wytwornego pałacu z widokiem na dolinę, każdy musi jeść. To sprawiało, że Hammonder był bardzo potężny w czasach obfitości, a jeszcze bardziej w czasach potrzeby.",
								"Czerwone Rękawiczki były mile widzianym dodatkiem do każdego spotkania towarzyskiego klasy wyższej przez wiele dekad, ale mało kto wiedział, że wśród nich jest włóczęga.",
								"Tatan z domu Freely, jak sam siebie nazwał, gdy po raz pierwszy przedstawiono go Hammonderowi, był oszustem. Nie pochodził ze szlachetnego rodu, za jaki się podawał, nie miał też żadnego majątku, o którym można by mówić. W rzeczywistości był złodziejem. Podróżował po królestwie, nigdy nie zatrzymując się w żadnej wiosce, mieście czy miasteczku na tyle długo, by się w nim zadomowić. Tym razem jednak dostrzegł szansę, by przechylić szalę na korzyść tych, którzy mieli mniej szczęścia.",
								"Szybko zyskał przychylność Hammondera, przedstawiając się jako człowiek o długiej historii związanej z handlem. Po wielu latach poprawiania interesów na farmach, zaproponował Hammonderowi, aby ten zajął się bardziej interesami. W tym czasie staruszek żył już wygodnie na emeryturze i czuł, że nie ma nikogo bardziej odpowiedniego do tego zadania. Szybko się zgodził i spędził resztę życia, ciesząc się swoim bogactwem i uczestnicząc w wystawnych spotkaniach z elitą królestwa, aż do śmierci w zasłużonym, lecz przedwczesnym wieku sześćdziesięciu trzech lat. Ponieważ Hammonder nie miał spadkobierców, którzy mogliby rościć sobie prawa do ziemi i zgromadzonego przez niego bogactwa, Tatan znalazł się w trudnej sytuacji. Prawo krajowe stanowiło, że majątek bezpotomnego pana, w przypadku braku testamentu, stawał się własnością korony. Tatan i inni przyjaciele starca przeszukali jego rzeczy w poszukiwaniu takiego dokumentu, ale bezskutecznie.",
								"Przekopując się przez swoje powiązania z podziemnymi sieciami złodziei i przestępców, Tatan szukał pomocy u The Quills (s.68), ściśle tajnej gildii fałszerzy, którzy zręcznie wytwarzają każdy dokument, jakiego wymaga potrzeba, jeśli żądający jest gotów zapłacić cenę... Dwa dni przed tym, jak król miał odebrać majątek Hammonderowi, w jego najbardziej osobistych aktach znaleziono testament, w którym Tatan i czterej inni członkowie Czerwonych Rękawic zostali beneficjentami jego ogromnego majątku. Majątek został podzielony równo pomiędzy pięciu, a ponieważ tak wielka rekompensata była tylko jedną piątą jego majątku, pozostała czwórka zachowała dla siebie wszelkie pretensje, że Tatanowi przypadła cała ziemia Hammondera. Tatan szybko został mianowany Panem i zajął miejsce w Domu Pana, w którym mieszkał Hammonder.",
								"Nawet dziś członkowie Czerwonych Rękawic składają się z byłych przestępców, takich czy innych. Wykorzystują swoją władzę, aby subtelnie przechylić wahadło polityki na swoją korzyść, kierując się filozofią, że życie jest tylko sztuką, a my wszyscy jesteśmy w niej aktorami. Każdy z nas może wiele zyskać, jeśli odegra właściwą rolę."

Kiedy Elenor zignorowała ją i spotkała się w tajemnicy ze swoim nowym ukochanym, podjęto szybkie i bezlitosne działania.",
								"Aby ukarać Elenor, matka domu poszła za jej zakazaną miłością. W krótkim czasie został oskarżony o spisek przez członka własnego domu szlacheckiego i wygnany w ciągu miesiąca. Elenor płakała samotnie w swojej kwaterze. Kiedy jej łzy wyschły, a ból na wspomnienie o nim był już tylko raną, postanowiła opuścić siostrzaną wspólnotę, marząc o dniu, w którym jej ukochany znów obejmie ją ramionami. Często myśli o tym, jak mogłaby się zemścić na osobach odpowiedzialnych za jego wygnanie."

W dniu swoich pięćdziesiątych urodzin został zdradzony przez swoją kochankę, odurzony i sprzedany brutalnemu i bezlitosnemu królowi, który kazał go spalić żywcem na szczycie wysokiej wydmy, tak by wszyscy widzieli. Wiele dni minęło, gdy do jego synów dotarła wiadomość o jego śmierci. Jechali oni wiele dni i nocy na wysoką wydmę, a gdy już tam dotarli, zebrali co się dało z prochów ojca. Poprzysięgli zemstę na wszystkich królestwach królestwa i zabrali prochy, zbierając je do miedzianej urny. Vabrum, najstarszy syn Vasima, zlecił wykucie nowego miecza, którym miał pozbawić głowy każdego króla, który spiskował przeciwko jego ojcu. Polecił kowalowi, by wymieszał prochy jego ojca z węglem, którego użył do wytopu rudy, nasycając w ten sposób ostrze duszą samego Vasima. Ostrze pozostało pamiątką po braciach Tell'ani i ich potomkach aż do czasu, gdy wypełniło klątwę Vabruma na królach. Po tym wydarzeniu ostrze w tajemniczy sposób zaginęło, ale twierdzi się, że wisi na ścianie niezliczonych zbrojowni w całym królestwie."

					"Aelar spent his youth tracking and hunting wild animals in a forested valley near his tribe's village, selling the pelts to traveling merchants. It was a simple life, but when he reached maturity he wanted more. He sought fortune in the settlements he had learned about from passing traders and weary travelers. He joined a caravan and journeyed far from home over several weeks. It wasn't long after reaching the fi rst city that he realized civilization isn't very civilized. ",
					"His entire stock of pelts which he brought with him was stolen on the first night they arrived, along with many other things from the other traders' wagons. Th e whole trade quarter of the city was in an uproar over the theft s. A reward was off ered to the fi rst person to bring the thief or thieves to justice. Aelar, having a vested interest in the matter, tracked the thieves who had fl ed with the stolen merchandise through a small forest and to a nearby river. Th ere was no negotiation; instead, his arrows found their mark and all three thieves were slain on the bank of the river as they loaded their boat. Th e stolen goods were returned to their rightful owners and Aelar was given a handsome reward.",
					"In the decades since, he has spent his days collecting on contracts for outlaws, murderers and violent criminals. All the while, he has gained much fame, and enough gold to get by. Now he finds himself the target of other hunters in his trade looking to collect a bounty on him.",
					"It would seem that he has unwittingly accepted and delivered on contracts for important members of criminal organizations. Whenever he spends time in and around civilization, he has to hide his face, and is habitually looking over his shoulder. ",

					"\"It's everyone's responsibility to be the best they can be.\" Aelar believes in the greater good, and that each individual should make the best future for the whole tribe. ",
					"Bonds ",
					"\"Hunting rabbits to hunting thieves. What will they think of me?\" Aelar's family is the most important thing in his life, even when they are far away. He desires to go back some day, but fears how his family will react when he does. ",
					"Flaws ",
					"\"Carry your own weight and we'll get along just fine.\" Don't count on Aelar to save those who can't save themselves. It's nature's way to let the strong survive and the weak perish. He may help his party members out of a deadly situation if they lack the wits or strength themselves, but only the fi rst time. ",

					"Thief Slayer It had been nearly two months of hard work: freezing nights on rooft ops and up to his knees in fi lth in the sewers, but it had all been worth it. Th e information he had gathered\u2014watch schedules, rivalries, fears\u2014meant his plan went off  without a hitch. Aft er tonight, Th e Vipers would never take out another bounty on him. Last night was hard, but by sunrise twelve of the highest ranking members of the group lay dead. Aelar had used their own techniques against them, making it look like old rivalries had fl ared, or treacherous deals had been made. Come the morning the bodies were discovered, and the entire gang dissolved into infi ghting factions. Th ose that weren't killed were now in chains and would doubtless face the hangman. Now there were just a few loose ends to clear up. Th ree loose ends to be precise, limping their way through the woods a few miles out from the city: the chief and his last two remaining loyal men.",
					"Aelar had been close on their trail throughout the evening and, now that they had stopped to make camp, he had his opportunity. Th e chief had taken the fi rst watch, staring slumped into the campfi re. Aelar nocked an arrow and drew back the string but, just as he leveled his aim, the chief's face hardened with a sudden resolve. Slowly, he got to his feet, a fl ash of fi re at his belt as his knife left  its sheath. Aelar held his breath, but he was seemingly not the chief's target. Instead, he moved towards his sleeping men, clearly meaning to put to rest any suspicion in his mind that they would turn on him as the others had.",
					"Aelar loosed the arrow; the chief grunted as it pierced his chest, and he sank to his knees. Th e two men awoke, startled, and reached for their weapons but two arrows piercing their wrists put a stop to such thoughts. Th e chief toppled forwards snapping a smoldering log and sending embers fl ying, and the men surrendered.",
					"Aelar left  them tied to a tree by the city's main gate, and ordered them to call for help, \"and when it comes,\" he told them, \"you shall confess your crimes and lead the guard to your camp.",

					"Overview ",
					"Aticus was born and raised in a beautiful green country, in a small village of lightfoot halflings. He and his parents, along with four brothers and one sister, lived quite comfortably in their vast burrow and Aticus had little care for the world of the big folk. That was, until one day when a traveling merchant came to town to trade with the little folk. Promising that Aticus would have astounding tales to relate on his return, the merchant convinced the eager halfling to accompany him during his travels.",
					"Aticus' parents were against his leaving, forbidding it, which only made Aticus want to leave even more. He left  one night through his bedroom window, taking with him only a few items, most importantly, his grandfather's flute. Ever since, he's been finding work as an entertainer in various taverns and inns across the land, longing to one day return home with a fortune beyond imagination to prove his parents wrong. ",
					"Personality Traits ",
					"\"That reminds me of when...\" Aticus knows a story for almost every situation, even if he embellishes the details a bit. He's not opposed to lying if it makes for a good story. Not easily insulted, he uses his small stature to his advantage from time to time. ",
					"Ideals ",
					"\"Come! Sit! Drink! Let me play you a tune!\" Aticus is a people person. He likes seeing the smiles on peoples' faces when he performs. He longs for bigger and better things, but doesn't want to let down his current employers. ",
					"Bonds ",
					"\"This? Oh, it's just my little piece of home.\" His fl ute is his most treasured possession; it reminds him of his grandfather, who was also an entertainer. Sometimes, he regrets ever leaving his family behind. ",
					"Flaws ",
					"\"I suppose one more little ditty won't hurt...\" Despite his best eff orts he is unreliable, oft en choosing a gig and a chance at riches over his friends. This has left  him with very few of them to speak of. He has a hard time saying no when it comes to performing, not only because of the money, but for the attention as well. His outlandish claims have caused people to question his stories more than once. ",
					"Roleplaying Aticus ",
					"Although barely twenty years old, his life has been filled with countless interesting people, who all had their own tales to tell. Of course he doesn't always know or remember every detail when he comes to retell them, so he often shifts the topic of the conversation to himself, or an experience that he had, or merges them with other stories that he heard second hand. Th is is not out of selfishness, but rather a desire to entertain people. He would never go out of his way to steal from someone, but if he happened to find a lost coin purse, he would be very confl icted on whether to seek out its owner or consider it an extra tip. ",
					"Most folk pay him little mind, considering him more of an oddity than anyone of worth.

					"Overview ",
					"Aticus was born and raised in a beautiful green country, in a small village of lightfoot halflings. He and his parents, along with four brothers and one sister, lived quite comfortably in their vast burrow and Aticus had little care for the world of the big folk. That was, until one day when a traveling merchant came to town to trade with the little folk. Promising that Aticus would have astounding tales to relate on his return, the merchant convinced the eager halfling to accompany him during his travels.",
					"Aticus' parents were against his leaving, forbidding it, which only made Aticus want to leave even more. He left  one night through his bedroom window, taking with him only a few items, most importantly, his grandfather's flute. Ever since, he's been finding work as an entertainer in various taverns and inns across the land, longing to one day return home with a fortune beyond imagination to prove his parents wrong. ",
					"Personality Traits ",
					"\"That reminds me of when...\" Aticus knows a story for almost every situation, even if he embellishes the details a bit. He's not opposed to lying if it makes for a good story. Not easily insulted, he uses his small stature to his advantage from time to time. ",
					"Ideals ",
					"\"Come! Sit! Drink! Let me play you a tune!\" Aticus is a people person. He likes seeing the smiles on peoples' faces when he performs. He longs for bigger and better things, but doesn't want to let down his current employers. ",
					"Bonds ",
					"\"This? Oh, it's just my little piece of home.\" His fl ute is his most treasured possession; it reminds him of his grandfather, who was also an entertainer. Sometimes, he regrets ever leaving his family behind. ",
					"Flaws ",
					"\"I suppose one more little ditty won't hurt...\" Despite his best eff orts he is unreliable, oft en choosing a gig and a chance at riches over his friends. This has left  him with very few of them to speak of. He has a hard time saying no when it comes to performing, not only because of the money, but for the attention as well. His outlandish claims have caused people to question his stories more than once. ",
					"Roleplaying Aticus ",
					"Although barely twenty years old, his life has been filled with countless interesting people, who all had their own tales to tell. Of course he doesn't always know or remember every detail when he comes to retell them, so he often shifts the topic of the conversation to himself, or an experience that he had, or merges them with other stories that he heard second hand. Th is is not out of selfishness, but rather a desire to entertain people. He would never go out of his way to steal from someone, but if he happened to find a lost coin purse, he would be very confl icted on whether to seek out its owner or consider it an extra tip. ",
					"Most folk pay him little mind, considering him more of an oddity than anyone of worth. He uses this to his advantage so as to avoid too much attention from the less than reputable folk that he often performs for. After all, when a thief thinks him penniless, they're not likely to make him their mark. ",

					"Cogrin's father taught him the art of swordplay from an early age, imparting all of his own knowledge to his son. On his sixteenth birthday, he was given a masterfully craft ed greatsword which his father had spent weeks forging, balancing, sharpening, and polishing. It was a thing to behold, and he was grateful. Cogrin's people were natural warriors, but only ever meant to defend what was theirs; their land and their families.",
					"The village lived in relative peace for many years until one day, when Cogrin and his uncle were hunting in the forest for deer and small game, they spied a troop of half a dozen vagabonds, scurrying through the forest with a common purpose: a scouting party, his uncle thought. Th ey were headed toward Cogrin's village, each of them heavily armed and ready for battle.",
					"Cogrin and his uncle intercepted the group and slew every one of them, by bow and by sword. It was the first time his blade had tasted human blood. When they returned to their village they found it ablaze. Their families were either slain or taken, along with anything valuable. Cogrin found his father's body near his forge, pierced with many arrows and laying in a circle of slain foes. His sword was missing, as was Cogrin's mother. ",
					"Personality Traits ",

					"Flaws",
					"\"I'll tell you when I've had enough!\" He has a weakness for vices of the city, especially hard drink and easy women. He's been the instigator in more than a few tavern brawls. He uses his great size to intimidate people more oft en than he should, and oft en regrets his actions in retrospect.",
					"Roleplaying Cogrin",
					"Cogrin has two very diff erent personalities. Around men, he is gruff  and quick to accept, or issue, a challenge. He will speak his mind, even going so far as to put another man's reputation and honor into question publicly. Around women, he is respectful and chivalrous. A gentle hulk, whose reputation among the fairer sex may actually be more wide spread than it is among men who either fear or admire him.",
					"He is not above stealing what he needs to survive and rarely has any money to pay for goods and services. He has been known to sneak into a hayloft  for a good night's rest if he can't fi nd a free room in the local inn.",
					"In combat, Cogrin will not back down to insurmountable odds, believing that he will be victorious over evil no matter what. He prefers to meet his enemies head on, but his experience in battle prevents him from passing up an attack of opportunity.",

She sees any attack on her employer's interests as a personal slight, and any long term plans are put on hold to systematically and brutally tear apart the lives of those responsible.  ",

While awaiting his turn at the gallows, he shared a jail cell with two members of a local thieves guild. Although they spoke the common tongue to him, they spoke to one another in a strange language. The night before they were to be executed, Mal was suddenly roused from sleep. His cell mates were conspiring. When they noticed he was awake they motioned for him to stay silent. They spoke in whispers, \"How much do you want to live?\" ",

Th ey explained that their guild brothers would be unlocking their cell shortly, and, if he so desired, he could go free as well. He was skeptical but desperate. Sure enough, minutes later, the light from a guard's oil lamp came through the small barred window in the cell door. A hushed voice echoed in the chamber just outside and one of the thieves in Mal's cell answered. Th e key in the lock chattered. It was now or never and Mal's cell mates didn't waste time.",
					"On the floor just outside his cell door there sat an oil lamp and a key ring. Mal knelt down to take them, but when he looked up again, the thieves were gone. He was on his own. ",
					"He crept slowly, but not very quietly, through the network of hallways and passages for several tense minutes, trying to recall the exact route that he was brought days earlier. It was hard to remember as he had been badly beaten by the city guard during his arrest, then again as he was brought to the prison and questioned.

					"Always fascinated, always reading, always learning; Nimh was forever asking questions, fi nding out how and why things worked, even as a child. Th e arthritic dog of a neighbor mysteriously disappeared one day and was found cut into neat pieces in the temple grounds next to Nimh's house. She had just wanted to know why it was broken and if it could be fi xed. Th e fi nal straw came as a teenager, when she ‘fi xed' the pneumonia of the farmer's prize sheep by transplanting into it the lungs of his carthorse. Th e townsfolk hid their children and animals as she made her way to the road. ",
					"She moved to a town where nobody knew of her peculiarities and trained as an apothecary, keeping her unusual ‘hobbies' to herself. Her intensive study turned her into an accomplished alchemist; observing the eff ects of elixirs on living things mesmerized her. Not satisfi ed with simply viewing their external eff ects, waifs and strays both human and animal oft en found themselves invited in out of the cold, then strapped to a table in her tiny backroom, fl esh and muscle neatly clipped back to reveal their inner workings. If they were lucky, Nimh would let them die fi rst.",
					"Completely ruthless and clinical, she had no reservations whatsoever when mortal representatives of the Demon Lord of the Affl  icted appeared to her and off ered her knowledge beyond measure in exchange for what's left  of those who perish on her table. To increase her body count, she now moonlights as a backstreet surgeon, mostly for the less savory characters of the town, and can easily be persuaded to facilitate a ‘tragic complication' if her patron would prefer the patient not make a full recovery. Aft er all, the necromancers get what they want and Nimh can start a new ‘side-project'... ",

It didn't take long for the cruel reality of life to take advantage of a young and naive Stanus. Discovering that bards just starting out are not unquestioningly invited to play at court to those of quality, he resorted to playing for coppers in disgusting taverns and outside inns. He didn't even make enough to rent a room, and oft en slept in dirty allyways and under eaves. Despite his poor lodgings, he maintained his dignity with fi ne clothes and a fantastic hat. ",
					"Late one night, he was playing his lute outside of a tavern in the dim lamp light. His hat, with a handful of coppers and a few silvers, was upturned on a stool in front of him. Unbeknownst to him, he had attracted the attention of a few ruffi  ans who falsely assumed that such a well-dressed fellow would have more than a his fair share of coins and other valuables. They waited until the streets were fairly clear before making their move. ",
					"One of the three ruffi  ans approached casually, bobbing his head to the music before dropping a copper into the hat. Stanus bowed his head to him as he continued to play. That's when the other two ruffians snuck up from either side. He was grabbed and pushed up against the tavern wall. One ruffian quickly grabbed the hat and ran. The other two began to turn out his pockets. He struggled until a swift  punch to the stomach doubled him over. One of them ripped the lute from his hands, breaking the shoulder strap. The other one found his coin purse, \"Where is the rest?!\" He demanded. Another punch to the stomach. ",
					"At that moment, a tall figure opened the tavern door and staggered out. He looked over at the three of them and said, \"Let him go.\" The ruffians chuckled. The figure stepped closer, Stanus looked up to see a dapper sailor with tanned skin and long dark hair. \"He may not be the best musician, but what he lacks in talent he makes up for in determination.\" ",
					"The ruffian who had taken the lute approached, intending to use it as a club. Without a second thought, the man drew a pistol concealed under his jacket and fi red, killing him. The other thief began to run, so the man drew another pistol, took aim, and fired. He fell with a grunt. The stranger looked down at Stanus, \"Care to join me for an ale?\" ",
