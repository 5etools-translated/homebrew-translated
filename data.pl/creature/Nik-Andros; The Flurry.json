					"The Flurry, as it is referred to in the common tongue, is a large terrifying swarm of tentacles and ferocity found primarily in dense forests and jungles of the Known World. Flurry can lie dormant for months waiting for prey to walk near their hide. While motionless the Flurry is indistinguishable from the surrounding vines or roots of its environment using a limited chameleon like ability to change their color to blend in. The Flurry can also burrow into the ground and wait for unsuspecting prey to walk over their trap. Once the Flurry detects movement it bursts from its hide with lightening like quickness, ambushing its prey with a nightmarish whirlwind of multiple tentacle attacks.",
					"These tentacles wrap around the target before the target even has a chance to react, causing panic and confusion. As targets try to flee, the Flurry hones in on their vibrations and takes chase. Once a target is grappled the Flurry begins draining its life force or slamming any creature trying to resist into unconsciousness. Targets can attempt to hide from the Flurry by remaining motionless (effectively making it \"Blinded\") but the tentacles will continue whipping around at everything within 10 feet as it tries to locate the intruder."
