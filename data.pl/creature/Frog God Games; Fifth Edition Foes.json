On the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; on the second round, to its waist; on the third round, to its neck; and on the fourth round, the stalker and any creature it has cocooned disappear completely underground. Melding into the ground does not provoke an opportunity attack. If the cerebral stalker is {@condition grappled} while sinking into the ground, it must win a Str contest against its grapplers to sink farther that round.
