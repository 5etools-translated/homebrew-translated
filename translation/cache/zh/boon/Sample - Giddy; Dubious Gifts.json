	"Up to a +4 bonus to Strength": "力量值最高+4的奖励",
	"{@spell burning hands} (1st level), {@spell scorching ray} (2nd level), {@spell fireball} (3rd level)": "{@spell burning hands}(第一层), {@spell scorching ray}(第二层), {@spell fireball}(第三层)",
	"Followers of the the True Flame are typically the downtrodden and desperate; men who want to watch the world burn. Those who stare too long into the flames of madness gain the Ever-Burning Embers trait.": "真火的追随者通常都是受压迫和绝望的人；他们想看着世界燃烧。那些在疯狂的火焰中凝视太久的人，会获得永远燃烧的余烬的特质。",
	"When this creature dies, its body turns to faintly-smoldering black ash. Over the next week, provided the ash is not intentionally scattered (it magically resists natural weather effects), it reforms into a hollow husk reminiscent of the creature's living body. Once this process completes, the creature returns to life in its new form, and its type becomes undead if it was not already. In addition, the creature gains immunity to fire damage.": "当这种生物死亡时，它的身体会变成微微发烫的黑灰。在接下来的一周里，只要灰烬没有被故意散落（它能神奇地抵抗自然天气的影响），它就会改革成一个空壳，让人联想到该生物的活体。一旦这个过程完成，该生物就会以其新的形式恢复生命，如果它的类型还没有变成亡灵，则会变成亡灵。此外，该生物获得了对火灾伤害的免疫力。",

	"As an action, this creature drains the moisture from a creature within its reach. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (the DC for which is based on this creature's Intelligence score). Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "作为一个动作，这个生物在它的范围内吸干一个生物的水分。该生物必须做一个 \"宪法救赎\"（DC是基于该生物的智力得分）。构造物和亡灵不受影响，植物和水元素在做这个蓄力动作时处于不利地位。拯救失败时，生物会受到{@damage 4d8}坏死的伤害，拯救成功时，会受到一半的伤害。"
