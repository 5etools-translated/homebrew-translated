It becomes very difficult to notice, appearing only as a slightly raised bump on the skin (this bump can be between 2-4 inches wide). At this point, especially if it has chosen an area on its host's back, the zonathid may remain undetected for weeks.": "如果它成功地粘住了它的受害者，深海藏羚羊就会进入它的进食阶段。首先，它将其口腔触角插入伤口暴露的血管中。这些触手从宿主身上吸取血液，提供养料和信息。一旦它开始从受害者身上吸收血液，Zonathid将改变外观，采用受害者皮肤的颜色和纹理。它变得非常难以察觉，只在皮肤上出现一个略微凸起的凸点（这个凸点可以在2-4英寸宽之间）。在这一点上，特别是如果它选择了宿主背部的一个区域，那么这只虫子可能在数周内都不会被发现。",
	"Once it has fully connected to the host's bloodstream and camouflaged itself, the abyssal zonathid begins its secondary feeding behavior. Though it is unkown exactly why, the creature will use its large central tongue to lap at the open wound, keeping it just irritated enough to prevent healing. While the numbing effects of the mucus last, this licking is undetectable. Even after the mucus has worn off, the host will be unable to pinpoint the sensation, feeling only a general discomfort and uneasiness. Explicitly focusing on this sensation and succeeding a DC 15 Perception check will allow a victim to localize this feeling to a specific part of the body, though it will not specifically reveal the zonathid.": "一旦它与宿主的血液完全连接，并将自己伪装起来，深渊鼢鼠就会开始它的二次进食行为。虽然不知道具体原因，但这种生物会用它中央的大舌头舔舐开放的伤口，使其受到足够的刺激而无法愈合。当粘液的麻痹作用持续时，这种舔舐是无法察觉的。即使在粘液消退后，宿主也无法确定这种感觉，只感到普遍的不适和不安。明确地关注这种感觉，并成功地进行DC15感知检查，可以让受害者将这种感觉定位到身体的某个特定部位，不过这并不能具体地揭示出佐纳希德。",
	"If the zonathid remains attached to a host for more than 2 weeks, the host's maximum hit points are reduced by {@dice 1d4}, and this effect increases by {@dice 1d4} for every 2 successive weeks. Additionally, each month the abyssal zonathid remains attached, the victim gains a level of exhaustion, which does not fade until the zonathid is removed.": "如果Zonathid在宿主身上停留超过2周，宿主的最大命中率会降低（%0%），而且每连续2周，这个效果会增加（%1%）。此外，每个月深渊鼢鼠都会附着在宿主身上，宿主会获得一定程度的疲惫感，这种疲惫感直到鼢鼠被移除才会消退。",
	"Removing an abyssal zonathid from its host is non-trivial. Attempting to pull or scrape it off, or remove it by some other means, is ill advised; when disrupted or injured, the zonathid releases chemicals that powerfully stimulate the host's nervous system, causing intense pain and convulsions. If it is killed while attached to a host (if the host has not already died from shock and muscle spasms), it releases potent toxins into the host's bloodstream, dealing {@dice 3d4} poison damage and poisoning the victim. A creature that has been poisoned in this way remains poisoned until healed by the effects of {@spell Lesser Restoration} or another spell or effect that cures diseases and conditions. The dead zonathid must also be removed from the wound and its oral tentacles extracted, which usually involves cutting off some of the host's skin, unless a method of dissolving the adhesive mucus can be found.": "从宿主身上移走深海区系动物是一件不容易的事。试图把它拉下来或刮下来，或用其他方法把它移走，都是不明智的；当被破坏或受伤时，深海虫会释放化学物质，有力地刺激宿主的神经系统，引起强烈的疼痛和抽搐。如果它在附着在宿主身上时被杀死（如果宿主还没有死于休克和肌肉痉挛），它就会向宿主的血液中释放强烈的毒素，造成（%0%）的中毒伤害并使受害者中毒。以这种方式中毒的生物会一直中毒，直到被{@spell Lesser Restoration}或其他治愈疾病和状况的法术或效果治愈。死去的zonathid也必须从伤口中取出，并抽出它的口腔触须，这通常需要割掉宿主的一些皮肤，除非能找到溶解粘液的方法。",
	"An abyssal zonathid may be successfully removed without poisoning its host if it is dealt twice its maximum HP in radiant damage in one round, or if the spell {@spell Lesser Restoration} or a similar spell is cast on it.": "如果深渊佐纳希德在一回合内受到两倍于其最大HP的辐射伤害，或者如果对它施放了{@spell Lesser Restoration}的法术或类似的法术，它可能被成功移除而不会使其宿主中毒。",

This pattern continues for every 5 additional activations (e.g. at 15 additional activations, DC is 20 and a roll of 1-4 triggers a heart attack), even if the maximum DC has already been reached.": "如果一个生物同时多次受到毒刺的影响，每增加一次激活，宪法拯救的DC就会增加1，最高DC为30。在第5次额外激活（（%0%））时，心脏病攻击范围增加1。这一模式在每5次额外激活时继续进行（例如，在15次额外激活时，DC为20，1-4的滚动触发心脏病攻击），即使已经达到最大DC。",

	"The acanthar urchin is a creature full of irregular, contradictory properties. Their venom is usually no more dangerous than a bee sting, but about 5% of victims suffer sudden cardiac arrest.

Finally, as a seeming rebellion against their toxic nature, the innards of acanthar urchins can be used to produce a soothing salve, useful for treating skin irritation and contact poisons.": "尖头海胆是一种充满了不规则、矛盾特性的生物。它们的毒液通常不会比蜜蜂蜇人更危险，但大约5%的受害者会出现心脏骤停。虽然就其体型而言相当坚固，但如果离开水太久，它们会以壮观的方式破坏稳定，突然爆炸并释放出大量的毒刺。最后，作为对其有毒性质的反叛，刺山海胆的内脏可以用来生产一种舒缓的药膏，对治疗皮肤刺激和接触性毒药很有用。",
	"Their odd idiosyncrasies don't stop with their physical features; while they can be found in shallow ocean waters like many other urchins, acanthar urchins are more common in sulfurous springs. It is still unknown how these creatures survive in such extreme conditions, or how they even reach such springs in the first place. Some theories suggest that the urchins release spores when they explode, hoping that at least a few reach a new body of water. Conversely, it is the belief of certain druidic circles that most acanthar urchins live in massive populations deep under the earth, and that the specimens found in sulfur springs are those few individuals that have floated to the surface. These druids also hold that acanthar urchins play a vital role in natural energy cycles.": "他们奇怪的特异性并不局限于他们的身体特征；虽然他们可以像许多其他海胆一样在浅海水域被发现，但棘齿海胆在硫磺泉中更为常见。目前还不知道这些生物是如何在如此极端的条件下生存的，或者说它们首先是如何到达这种泉水的。一些理论认为，海胆在爆炸时释放出孢子，希望至少有几个到达新的水体。相反，某些德鲁伊教派认为，大多数棘齿海胆都生活在地底深处的大量种群中，而在硫磺泉中发现的标本是那些漂浮到地表的少数个体。这些德鲁伊还认为，棘齿海胆在自然界的能量循环中发挥着重要作用。",
	"For adventurers, however, the usefulness of the acanthar urchin in setting traps is much more interesting than its ecology. The urchins may be used as fire-activated grenades or mines. The cumulative effects of their venom mean that even a small pile of urchins can be turned into a dangerous explosive trap with little more than a torch or some lamp oil.": "然而，对于冒险者来说，棘齿海胆在设置陷阱方面的用处比它的生态环境要有趣得多。海胆可以作为火力启动的手榴弹或地雷使用。它们的毒液的累积效应意味着，即使是一小堆海胆也可以变成一个危险的爆炸性陷阱，只需要一个火把或一些灯油。",

	"Understandably, these druids are in high demand by the elite botanists and noblemen who desire a carrion flower as a sign of prestige; however, they are exceedingly difficult to contact and extremely selective in their clientele. They also tend to ask for non-traditional forms of payment, such as the cleanup of a city park or the purging of some unnatural beast. Several groups of gnomes and elves are currently attempting to develop a similar technique in order to undercut the druids and reap substantial profit, but they have made little progress. Reports of falling asleep on the job are common.": "可以理解的是，这些德鲁伊受到精英植物学家和贵族们的追捧，他们渴望得到一朵腐尸花作为声望的象征；然而，他们极难接触到，而且对客户的选择极为挑剔。他们也倾向于要求非传统形式的报酬，如清理城市公园或清除一些非自然的野兽。一些地精和精灵团体目前正试图开发一种类似的技术，以削弱德鲁伊的地位并获得可观的利润，但他们没有取得什么进展。在工作中睡着的报告很常见。",

	"Because of their unique abilities, jewel wasps are both highly sought after by jewelers, and considered pests by those who store large quantities of treasure. Perhaps as a result of this twofold motivation to kill or capture them, jewel wasps are more aggressive than normal wasps, and their natural instinct is to flee from or attack any humanoid that enters their territory. For this reason, some dragons intentionally keep a nest of jewel wasps with their hoards, apparently deciding that the consumption of a few gems is worth the constant protection. Indeed, these dragons often consider the jewel wasps a part of their collection, seeing their behavior not as destructive, but as the transformation of one treasure into another.": "由于其独特的能力，珠宝蜂既受到珠宝商的热烈追捧，又被那些储存大量财宝的人视为害虫。也许是由于这种杀戮或捕获它们的双重动机，珠宝蜂比普通黄蜂更具攻击性，它们的自然本能是逃离或攻击任何进入其领地的人形生物。出于这个原因，一些龙故意将一窝珠宝蜂和它们的囤积物放在一起，显然它们认为消耗一些宝石值得持续保护。事实上，这些龙常常把珠宝蜂视为其收藏品的一部分，认为它们的行为不是破坏性的，而是将一种宝物转化为另一种宝物。",

	"Pelican flowers are uncommon, tending to grow in places not frequented by people. Gardeners occasionally seek them out for use as natural pest control, but this is a tricky endeavor. Since the flowers are not intelligent enough to be trained, they often end up eating a pet or two before the gardener in question realizes the problem and gets rid of them. Druids and tribal shamans sometimes maintain a population of pelican flowers for medicinal use; their digestive acids, when diluted, are very effective at reducing itching, irritation, and pain associated with bug bites and stings, poisonous plants, and other minor inconveniences. In more concentrated solutions, the acids can be used to dissolve organic matter. One flower provides one vial of digestive acid, which functions in combat like a regular vial of acid, except that it deals 2 ({@dice 1d4}) acid damage on hit and at the start of the target's turns, until a creature uses an action to wipe off the acid. Out of combat, one vial takes 1 minute to dissolve an area of animal or plant matter no larger than 6 inches on a side. 15 vials will dissolve 1 cubic foot of flesh or plant matter in about 10 minutes, while dissolving the same amount of bone takes roughly an hour.

	"While it behaves almost identically to bestial snakes, the bush viper is some form of awakened plant, its body composed similarly to an {@creature awakened shrub}. Like true snakes, bush vipers are hesitant to bite anything that isn't prey unless they feel unavoidably threatened.

	"The process of bush viper reproduction is both beautiful and intricate. As plants, bush vipers seem capable of surviving on 3-5 hours of sunlight per day, along with an adequate supply of water, but they are incapable of reproducing without a couple meals of living prey. In springtime, if a bush viper is adequately fed with small reptiles and rodents, or particularly large insects, it will begin to produce small flowers along its body. Males produce a plethora of flowers, turning them almost entirely pink, while females will only grow a few slightly larger flowers. When properly pollinated, the female's flowers swell into bulbs. Fully grown, the bulbs are about the size and shape of a regular snake egg, but they retain the bright pink coloration of the mother's flowers. Once they are \"ripe,\" the bulbs fall off the mother, at which point she collects them into a small pile and spends about one week coiled around them, protecting them while ensuring they receive adequate sunlight. During this time, the bright pink bulbs slowly change to a verdant green color. When all traces of pink are gone, a baby bush viper emerges from the bulb. This is a crucial time for those wishing to tame a bush viper. In order to form the proper bond, a trainer must ensure that they are the first creature the baby sees when it hatches. They must then care for the viper as it grows, developing both its trust and its understanding of commands.": "丛林毒蛇的繁殖过程既美丽又错综复杂。作为植物，丛林毒蛇似乎能够靠每天3-5小时的阳光以及充足的水供应而生存，但如果没有几顿活的猎物，它们就没有能力繁殖。在春天，如果丛林毒蛇被充分喂养了小型爬行动物和啮齿动物，或特别大的昆虫，它将开始沿着身体开出小花。雄性会开出大量的花，几乎完全变成粉红色，而雌性只会长出一些稍大的花。当适当授粉时，雌性的花会膨胀成球茎。完全长大后，球茎的大小和形状与普通的蛇蛋差不多，但它们保留了母花的亮粉色。一旦它们 \"成熟\"，鳞茎就会从母体上脱落，这时，母体会把它们收集到一个小堆里，花大约一周的时间盘绕在它们周围，保护它们，同时确保它们得到充足的阳光。在这段时间里，明亮的粉红色球茎慢慢地变成了翠绿的颜色。当所有粉红色的痕迹都消失时，一条小的灌木蝰蛇就会从球茎中出现。对于那些希望驯服丛林毒蛇的人来说，这是一个关键时期。为了形成适当的联系，训练者必须确保他们是婴儿孵化时看到的第一个生物。然后，他们必须在毒蛇的成长过程中照顾它，培养它的信任和对命令的理解。",
	"Given their nature, bush vipers are valued as familiars for druids, hedge wizards, and other practitioners of magic who operate far from civilization. Bush vipers do not function well in industrial or urban settings, or anywhere they do not have easy access to trees, fresh water, and sunlight. A bush viper deprived of these things for even a day begins to brown and wilt, slowly losing mobility until it becomes as stiff and brittle as dead twigs and leaves.": "鉴于它们的性质，丛林毒蛇被视为德鲁伊、篱笆巫师和其他远离文明的魔法从业者的宠物。丛林毒蛇在工业或城市环境中不能很好地发挥作用，或者在任何不容易接触到树木、淡水和阳光的地方。被剥夺了这些东西的丛林毒蛇，哪怕是一天，都会开始变色和枯萎，慢慢失去行动能力，直到变得像死树枝和树叶一样僵硬和脆弱。",

Only male's flowers are used; picking a female's flowers is extremely taboo in most druidic circles.

In addition to a boar's normal lower-jaw tusks, babirusa have two tusks that emerge through the top of their snout. Both sets of tusks curve backward, and if not continually ground down through regular use, can grow to penetrate the animal's own skull.

	"Because of their inherent instability, banffia are always seeking sources of magic to siphon from, strengthening the field that gives them form. Killing a banffia causes the full untangling of this magical field. When this happens, the remaining energy in the banffia erupts outward in a violent flash. Since they're not terribly aggressive unless provoked, this means that killing banffia is often more dangerous than leaving them alone. Unless, of course, they've formed a swarm.": "由于其固有的不稳定性，Banffia总是在寻找魔力源泉，以加强赋予它们形态的领域。杀死一个Banffia会导致这个魔法场的完全解开。当这种情况发生时，Banffia中剩余的能量会在一个猛烈的闪光中向外喷发。由于它们除非受到挑衅，否则不会有很大的攻击性，这意味着杀死Banffia往往比让它们独处更危险。当然，除非它们已经形成了一个群落。",
	"Swarms of banffia don't form naturally, and banffia on their own aren't even intelligent enough to work together in such a fashion. Instead, a swarm of banffia is formed when magical energy coalesces into a physical form. Often taking the appearance of a swirling ball of energy, this nexus of magic attracts nearby banffia. It's unclear exactly what happens after that, but the banffia seem to feed off the nexus at the same time as it draws energy from them. The end product is a swirling mass of banffia, with the magical nexus at the center, tearing accross the landscape and causing magical mayhem wherever it goes.": "Banffia群不是自然形成的，Banffia本身甚至没有足够的智慧以这种方式一起工作。相反，Banffia群是在魔法能量凝聚成一个物理形式时形成的。通常以一个旋转的能量球的形式出现，这个魔法中心吸引着附近的班菲亚。目前还不清楚之后到底发生了什么，但班菲亚似乎在从它们身上吸取能量的同时，也从这个结点上获取能量。最终的产物是一团旋转的班芙拉，以魔法结点为中心，撕裂整个景观，所到之处造成魔法混乱。",
	"Dispersing a swarm of banffia is nontrivial. Killing an individual banffia causes it to explode, and this release of magical energy strengthens the other members of the swarm, while also increasing the destructive potential of the nexus. Destroying the nexus itself, either by dispelling the magic or simply damaging it until it can't hold itself together, is the easiest way to get rid of a banffia swarm without dealing with tens or hundreds of magical explosions.": "驱散成群的Banffia是一件不容易的事。杀死一个班芙拉会导致它爆炸，而这种魔法能量的释放会加强虫群的其他成员，同时也会增加结界的破坏力。摧毁节点本身，无论是通过驱散魔法，还是简单地破坏它，直到它无法维持自身，都是摆脱班菲亚群的最简单的方法，而无需处理数十或数百个魔法爆炸的问题。",
	"The swarm has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "蜂群对法术和其他魔法效果的救赎有优势。",
	"The nexus is the core of the swarm. Destroying it immediately dispels the swarm. {@spell Dispel Magic} treats the nexus as a 4th-level spell; a success instantly destroys the nexus.": "纽带是虫群的核心。摧毁它可以立即驱散虫群。{@spell Dispel Magic}将结界视为四级法术；成功后立即摧毁结界。",
	"The nexus has 30 hit points; attack rolls of 20 or higher hit the nexus instead of the swarm. Damage to the nexus from spells is reduced by 7 ({@dice 2d6}) per spell level, or by 3 ({@dice 1d6}) for cantrips. Reducing the swarm to 0 hit points without killing the nexus destabilizes the nexus, causing a 20-foot radius spherical explosion that deals {@damage 8d6} force damage to creatures that fail a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, or half as much to creatures that succeed.": "巢穴有30个命中点；攻击卷轴20或更高时，会击中巢穴而不是蜂群。每一级法术的伤害会减少7({@dice 2d6})，或3({@dice 1d6})的咒语伤害。在不杀死节点的情况下，将蜂群降低到0点，会破坏节点的稳定，造成一个20英尺半径的球形爆炸，对未能通过{@dc 15}灵巧救赎的生物造成{@damage 8d6}武力伤害，或对成功的生物造成一半的伤害。",
	"When the swarm takes more than 10 damage from a single attack, a couple banffia die and explode. Creatures within 10 feet of the swarm must make {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throws, taking 10 ({@damage 4d4}) elemental damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The nexus also absorbs some of the explosion, restoring 10 ({@dice 4d4}) hit points to both the swarm and the nexus.": "当虫群在一次攻击中受到超过10次伤害时，有几个班菲亚会死亡并爆炸。蜂群10英尺范围内的生物必须进行{@dc 15}的灵巧救赎，失败时受到10({@damage 4d4})元素伤害，成功时受到一半的伤害。纽带也会吸收部分爆炸，恢复蜂群和纽带的10({@dice 4d4})点伤害。",
	"When the swarm deals damage with its attacks or traits, the damage type (\"elemental damage\") is determined by a {@dice 1d6}.

On a roll of 6, the damage is overcharged by the nexus; roll again, and add 4 ({@damage 1d8}) to the damage.": "当虫群用它的攻击或特性造成伤害时，伤害类型（\"元素伤害\"）由（%0%）决定。掷出1-5意味着酸（1）、冷（2）、火（3）、闪电（4）和毒（5）伤害。当掷出6个骰子时，伤害会被结界过度充能；再次掷出，并在伤害上加上4（（%1%））。",
	"A creature that touches the swarm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 ({@damage 2d4}) elemental damage.": "在5英尺范围内，触及蜂群或用近战攻击击中它的生物会受到5（（%0%））的元素伤害。",
