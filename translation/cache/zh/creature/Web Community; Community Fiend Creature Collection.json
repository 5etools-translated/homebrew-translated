But they do still have the ability to talk and state their wishes that a smart creator is better off satisfying not only to gain its favor but to avoid being shredded to bits. While on the prowl the goredrinker's smell is its best weapon, they can pick up the scent of the deceased even to the afterlife. They will go on abandoned battlefields and search for their prey.

The ritual must then be perfomed in the abyss on contaminated earth. All the components shall be set afire and 3 creatures will be impaled by spikes protruding from the ground. The demon will then be born from the will of the abyss. As its life was given by fire, its only fear is that it will take it away again.": "恶魔的怀抱。第一个食人魔据说是在一个试图为他的深渊军队没收任何丢失的灵魂的恶魔领主的服务下创造的。关于如何创造它们的知识已经被学者们禁止了。一些人仍然设法发现，你需要一只狗的尸体、一只刺尾狮的鬃毛、一只仍然活着的奇美拉的翅膀和一些更多未知的成分。仪式必须在被污染的地球上的深渊中进行。所有组件都要被点燃，3个生物将被地面上突出的尖刺刺死。然后恶魔将从深渊的意志中诞生。由于它的生命是由火赋予的，它唯一的恐惧是火会再次夺走它。",
