	"An aswang is an accursed humanoid that transforms into a fiend. In its natural form, an aswang resembles a typical humanoid. At night, it can change its shape into a cunning, demonic predator. It hunts other humanoids and feasts on their blood, organs, or life force.": "阿斯旺是一种被诅咒的人形生物，可以转化为恶魔。在其自然形态下，阿斯旺类似于一个典型的人形生物。到了晚上，它可以改变形状，变成一个狡猾的、恶魔般的捕食者。它猎杀其他人形生物，并以他们的血液、器官或生命力为食。",
	"A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting {@spell remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a {@spell wish}. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "一个人形生物在自愿与魔王签订或被骗与魔王签订黑暗契约后，可以受到阿斯旺诅咒的折磨，有时是通过巫婆的行为。如果父母一方或双方都是阿斯旺人，也可以生来就受到这种影响。施放{@spell remove curse}、{@spell greater restoration}或类似的法术可以使人摆脱诅咒，但天生的阿斯旺只能通过{@spell wish}来摆脱诅咒。一个阿斯旺可以抵抗它的诅咒，也可以欢迎它。通过抵抗诅咒，阿斯旺在自然形态下可以保持其正常的行为和个性。它可以尝试按照自己的意愿生活，但必须不断避免进食的冲动。然而，在月圆之夜，饥饿感变得过于强烈，诅咒战胜了个体，迫使它转变为恶魔的形态。被驱使到这种状态的阿斯旺会变得饥肠辘辘，在吃饱之前不会停止猎杀。每当它在恶魔形态下未能进食的夜晚，它就会获得1级的（%3%）。",
	"A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form.": "一个真正堕落的人，或者被它腐蚀的人，把阿旺的诅咒看作是一种礼物，随着时间的推移，掌握了变身为恶魔的能力。然而，阿斯旺只能在晚上变身，并保持其恶魔的形态直到黎明，这时它会自动变回人形。",
	"Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew.": "阿斯旺人隐藏在众目睽睽之下，生活在普通人中间，经常从事诸如屠夫、猎人、掘墓人、标本剥制人和捕兽人等职业，以帮助转移人们对他们的家为什么有时会有腐肉和死亡的味道的怀疑。他们把自己插入类人社区，通过魅力、友好和慷慨赢得邻居的信任。但他们避免在身体上接近一个人，因为如果有人直接看他们的眼睛，他们会发现自己的倒影是颠倒的。阿斯旺斯人倾向于捕食那些如果突然消失就不会有人惦记的社会成员。如果没有这样的目标，它们会前往另一个社区、定居点或远离它们家园的地方。他们不会在自己居住的地方附近冒险进食。任何对他们产生怀疑的人，或看到他们的魔鬼形态，都会被立即处理，因为害怕激起有组织的暴徒。一个成功的阿斯旺斯家族可以住在城郊，多年来捕食市民而不被发现。如果事情开始出现问题，阿斯旺格人就不会冒险留下来。他们会尽快离开，在另一个社区建立自己的地位，重新开始。",
	"Aswangs are careful, patient, and stealthy hunters, often choosing targets that are defenseless or weak. Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up.": "阿斯旺斯是谨慎、耐心和隐蔽的猎手，经常选择无防备或弱小的目标。通常在白天，阿斯旺斯会挑选和标记它们的目标，并确定它们的居住地。晚上，它们变身后，跟踪猎物并等待时机，直到它们能在目标最脆弱的时候发动攻击。这意味着它们的大部分攻击都发生在目标单独或睡着的时候。它们经常把受害者的尸体留在原地，以避免被抓的风险。因为他们杀死的人身上有通常归咎于食尸鬼、狼人或吸血鬼的特定类型的伤口，所以他们并不担心他们的存在会被怀疑。",
	"Aswangs, much like vampires, have several weaknesses. They find the pungent smell of garlic repulsive, and the chemical properties of pure salt sicken it. While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a {@spell Dispel Evil and Good} spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute.": "阿斯旺人和吸血鬼一样，有几个弱点。他们发现大蒜的刺激性气味令人厌恶，而纯盐的化学特性使其感到恶心。虽然阿斯旺可以抵御大多数打击，但用黄貂鱼的带刺尾巴制成的武器，即使是简单的武器，也能正常伤害他们。因为他们在变身时成为恶魔，所以他们容易受到专门伤害恶魔的攻击，比如圣水。如果阿斯旺对{@spell Dispel Evil and Good}法术的救赎失败，它就会恢复到它的人形，并在1分钟内不能变身。",
	"The mighty archons are exalted celestial champions who maintain peace, uphold justice, and serve the angels and deities of Arcadia, Bytopia, and the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia.": "强大的弓箭手是高高在上的天体冠军，他们维持和平，维护正义，为阿卡迪亚、拜托比亚和天体山七重天的天使和神灵服务。",
	"Whereas angels act more as agents, commanders, and generals, archons fill the role of soldiers, scouts, and support specialists. They protect the innocent and defenseless and aid the wounded and sick. They despise and stand against malevolent supernatural creatures such as demons, devils, yugoloths, and evil undead. They capture and bring to justice powerful creatures who have performed depraved and despicable acts. Unfortunately, their unwavering sense of righteousness often leaves them vulnerable to manipulation and conflict.": "天使更多的是扮演代理人、指挥官和将军的角色，而大天使则扮演士兵、侦察员和支持专家的角色。他们保护无辜和无助的人，帮助受伤和生病的人。他们鄙视并反对邪恶的超自然生物，如恶魔、魔鬼、尤戈洛人和邪恶的亡灵。他们捕捉并将那些做出堕落和卑鄙行为的强大生物绳之以法。不幸的是，他们坚定不移的正义感常常使他们容易受到操纵和冲突。",
	"Archons never willingly use violence unless it is necessary. However, if combat is unavoidable, archons can be a terrifying thing to behold as they become justice and vengeance personified. They radiate an aura of menace that can sap the will of their foes. Archons are expert battle tacticians, able to teleport at will and cast powerful divine spells that can aid allies and banish foes. In addition to their impressive powers, they are also fearless, tireless, resistant to most attacks, and can't be {@condition charmed}.": "除非有必要，否则大主教从不愿意使用暴力。然而，如果战斗是不可避免的，大弓箭手可以是一个可怕的东西，因为他们成为正义和复仇的化身。他们散发出一种威胁的光环，可以消磨敌人的意志。大天使是战斗战术专家，能够随意传送并施展强大的神术，帮助盟友并驱逐敌人。除了他们令人印象深刻的力量之外，他们还无所畏惧，不知疲倦，对大多数攻击都有抵抗力，而且不能被（%0%）。",
	"While they rarely leave Mount Celestia, archons can be encountered anywhere, even in the Lower Planes. They frequently travel to the Material Plane on a variety of missions, acting as couriers, messengers, spies, or marshals. Archons have been known to assist adventurers, especially if they are favored by their deities.": "虽然他们很少离开Celestia山，但在任何地方都能遇到大天使，甚至在下层世界。他们经常到物质界执行各种任务，充当信使、信使、间谍或元帅。众所周知，大天使会帮助冒险者，尤其是当他们受到神灵的青睐时。",
	"There are eight major types of archons, each with different characteristics and abilities. The {@creature hound archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}, {@creature justice archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}, and {@creature lantern archon|MonsterManualExpanded3|lantern archons} are the most numerous ones, and make up the bulk of the archon army, serving as foot soldiers, guards, and scouts. The {@creature owl archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}, {@creature trumpet archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}, and {@creature warden archon|MonsterManualExpanded3} are specialists, while the {@creature sword archon|MonsterManualExpanded3} and the {@creature throne archon|MonsterManualExpanded3} act as military officer.": "弓箭手有八种主要类型，每一种都有不同的特点和能力。{@creature hound archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}、{@creature justice archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}和{@creature lantern archon|MonsterManualExpanded3|lantern archons}是最多的，构成了弓箭手军队的主体，充当步兵、卫兵和侦察兵。{@creature owl archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}、{@creature trumpet archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}和{@creature warden archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}是专家，而{@creature sword archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}和{@creature throne archon|MonsterManualExpanded3}则充当军事官员。",
	"An archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "弓箭手不需要吃、喝、睡。",
	"Often referred to by desert nomads as the great desert dragon or sand dragon, the brown dragon is a cunning creature, but it is also haughty, irritable, paranoid, and slothful. It provides for itself in whatever way requires the least inconvenience and steers clear of unnecessary trouble. It makes its home in underground caverns and the ruins of ancient cities buried beneath the wastelands.": "棕龙通常被沙漠游牧民称为大沙漠龙或沙龙，它是一种狡猾的生物，但它也是傲慢的、易怒的、偏执的和懒惰的。它以任何需要最少麻烦的方式为自己提供服务，并避开不必要的麻烦。它把家安在地下洞穴和埋在荒地下的古城废墟里。",
	"The brown dragon is a flightless creature that swims under vast desert sands like a bloodthirsty shark at sea. Its scales are leathery and softer than the typical dragon's metallic-like ones and have the color that matches its natural hunting grounds, ranging from dark brown at birth to dull light brown in their old age. The brown dragon has four short, muscular limbs that end with webbed claws suitable for digging through the sand and a pair of leathery wing vestiges at the back of its shoulders. A few lucky survivors who survived a brown dragon's attack recall seeing twin dorsal-like fins, which were the dragon's wings, cutting through the sand during its approach.": "棕龙是一种不会飞的生物，在广阔的沙漠沙地下游动，就像海上的嗜血鲨鱼。它的鳞片是革质的，比一般龙的金属般的鳞片更柔软，而且颜色与它的天然猎场相匹配，从出生时的深褐色到年老时的暗淡浅褐色。棕龙有四条短小的、肌肉发达的四肢，末端有适合挖沙的蹼爪，肩部后面有一对皮质的翅膀残骸。一些从棕龙的攻击中幸存下来的幸运者回忆说，他们在棕龙接近的过程中看到了两个类似背鳍的东西，那是棕龙的翅膀，在沙地上划过。",
	"The brown dragon consumes minerals but prefers meat. It particularly relishes the taste of livestock, especially camels and horses. It will go to great lengths to attack caravans and herders but is careful enough to do so only in isolated areas and to not leave any survivors to avoid attracting unwanted attention, such as a party of adventurers. The brown dragon hunts by burying itself in the sand, waiting patiently until it senses vibrations caused by a prey's movement, after which it explodes from its hiding place, showering sand everywhere as it leaps toward its target. The brown dragon's breath is a line of highly corrosive sand that can also blind those that are hit by it.": "棕龙消耗矿物质，但更喜欢吃肉。它特别喜欢牲畜的味道，尤其是骆驼和马。它将不遗余力地攻击商队和牧民，但它很小心，只在偏僻的地方这样做，而且不留下任何幸存者，以免引起不必要的注意，如冒险者队伍。棕龙的狩猎方式是把自己埋在沙子里，耐心等待，直到它感觉到猎物的运动所引起的震动，然后它从藏身之处爆发出来，在跃向目标的时候，沙子四处飞溅。棕龙的呼吸是一条具有高度腐蚀性的沙线，也能使被它击中的人失明。",
	"The brown dragon is fiercely territorial and will slay and consume other burrowing predatory creatures such as ankhegs, bulettes, kruthiks, and umber hulks. It tolerates the presence of oozes and ooze elementals, as well as desert-dwelling vermin like giant antlions and scorpions, only because the brown dragon doesn't see them as competition or threat to its well-being and treasure hoard. The brown dragon dislikes other dragons, though, and especially hates and fears blue dragons, which often shares its territory with them. If an older blue dragon threatens it, the brown dragon will establish a new lair, move its treasure, and abandon its old home.": "棕龙有很强的领地意识，会杀死并吞噬其他穴居掠夺性生物，如安克希斯（ankhegs）、布勒特（bulettes）、克鲁斯克（kruthiks）和乌尔姆（umber hulks）。它能容忍渗水者和渗水元素的存在，以及沙漠中的害虫，如巨蚁和蝎子，只是因为棕龙不认为它们是竞争者，也不认为它们对它的福祉和宝藏有威胁。不过，棕龙不喜欢其他龙，尤其讨厌和害怕蓝龙，因为它经常与蓝龙分享它的领地。如果一只年长的蓝龙威胁到它，棕龙会建立一个新的巢穴，转移它的财宝，并放弃它的老家。",
	"The brown dragon sees anything weaker than itself as nothing more than prey. It does not care much for speaking with other intelligent creatures, especially adventurers, as it finds it odd and beneath itself to talk to its food. If it does participate in a conversation, the brown dragon will feign boredom and disinterest and even toy with whoever it is talking to, subtly steering topics to potential prey, treasure, and threats.": "棕龙认为任何比自己弱的东西都不过是猎物。它不太关心与其他智慧生物的交谈，尤其是冒险者，因为它觉得与自己的食物交谈是很奇怪的，而且是在自己之下。如果它确实参与了谈话，棕龙会假装无聊和不感兴趣，甚至玩弄与它谈话的人，巧妙地将话题转向潜在的猎物、宝藏和威胁。",
	"When ambitious mages become obsessed with power and knowledge, they push themselves beyond their limits and dabble with dark magic they don't fully understand. They often take shortcuts and ignore the risks. It only takes a potent spell to malfunction or an experiment to go terribly awry, and they inadvertently unleash powerful negative energy that consumes their bodies and souls. If these mages also lived a depraved life, they may not pass to the afterlife. Instead, their spirit reforms as a malevolent wraith, but with their memories and knowledge intact. Insane and filled with hate for the living, they now use their magic to destroy all life.": "当雄心勃勃的法师沉迷于权力和知识时，他们会超越自己的极限，涉足他们并不完全了解的黑魔法。他们经常走捷径，忽略了风险。只需要一个强大的法术出现故障或一个实验出现可怕的错误，他们就会无意中释放出强大的负能量，吞噬他们的身体和灵魂。如果这些法师也过着堕落的生活，他们可能无法进入来世。相反，他们的灵魂会被改造成一个邪恶的包裹，但他们的记忆和知识是完整的。疯了，对活人充满了仇恨，他们现在用他们的魔法来摧毁所有的生命。",
	"Wortlings look like short, pudgy humanoids with wrinkled, purple bark-like skin and limbs that end in sharp, venomous claws. They appear to have gleaming red eyes, but these are nothing more than an organ that gives off light. These 'offspring' are born mute and without the sense of sight, smell, and hearing. They can sense their surroundings through {@sense blindsight}. Wortlings use their numbers to their advantage when attacking prey.": "Wortlings看起来像矮胖的人形动物，皮肤上有皱纹，像紫色的树皮，四肢末端有锋利的毒爪。他们看起来有一双闪闪发光的红眼睛，但这只不过是一个能发出光的器官而已。这些 \"后代 \"出生时是哑巴，没有视觉、嗅觉和听觉。他们可以通过（%0%）感知周围的环境。Wortling在攻击猎物时利用它们的数量优势。",
	"Wortlings have a lifespan of 40-45 days. If a wortling is still alive when the orcwort decides to sleep, it will plant itself into the ground and if it survives, will eventually grow into another orcwort. Fortunately, an orcwort rarely allows this to happen as it does not want to compete with another of its kind. It often makes sure it has killed all of its wortlings before it begins its dormant state.": "小虫子的寿命为40-45天。如果在兽皮草决定睡觉的时候，小兽皮草还活着，它就会把自己种到地里，如果它能活下来，最终会成长为另一种兽皮草。幸运的是，兽皮草很少允许这种情况发生，因为它不希望与另一个同类竞争。在开始休眠状态之前，它通常会确保自己已经杀死了所有的虫子。",
	"Long ago, when elven lands were experiencing frequent raids from drow spellcasters, an order of artificers and druids that worshipped Corellon Larethian developed a means that could help defend against them. The first wood golems were created then, born from reconstituted dead trees, powered by arcane and divine magic, and bound with an elemental spirit from the Plane of Earth. Because of their hardiness and resistance to magic, the wood golems became instrumental in easily repelling the drow attacks. Soon, knowledge of crafting such golems was shared with other elven communities. As time passed, other races somehow learned how to create them as well.": "很久以前，当精灵族的土地频繁遭遇鸦人法术师的袭击时，一个崇拜科瑞隆-拉雷西安的工匠和德鲁伊团体开发了一种可以帮助抵御他们的方法。第一批木甲虫就是在那时被创造出来的，它们诞生于重组的枯树，由奥术和神力驱动，并与来自地球世界的元素精神结合。由于它们的坚韧和对魔法的抵抗力，木制地鼠在轻松击退乌鸦的攻击方面发挥了作用。很快，制作这种巨兽的知识就与其他精灵社区分享。随着时间的推移，其他种族也以某种方式学会了如何制造它们。",
	"Sometimes mistaken for a treant, a wood golem resembles a 10-foot tall humanoid-shaped tree that is often designed to look like a knight. Elven runes etched on various surfaces of its body glow and pulse bluish-green. The wood golem moves with a stiff and lumbering gait, with every step accompanied by the sound of straining wood. Thick roots grow and extend from the golem's feet, constantly digging into the ground when the golem stands still.": "有时会被误认为是树人，木头人类似于一棵10英尺高的人形树，通常被设计成骑士的模样。刻在其身体不同表面上的精灵符文会发光，并发出蓝绿色的脉冲。木头傀儡以僵硬的步态移动，每一步都伴随着紧张的木材声。粗大的树根从木头人的脚上生长并延伸，当木头人站立不动时，不断地钻入地面。",
	"In combat, the wood golem bludgeons enemies with its massive fists. Against quick foes, the golem can cause thorny shrubs, weeds, and vines to sprout underneath its targets, entangling them. The prickly vegetation persists for a minute, painfully cutting and rooting those caught within it, allowing the golem to reach the targets.": "在战斗中，木头人用它巨大的拳头击打敌人。对付速度快的敌人，木头人可以使目标下面长出带刺的灌木、杂草和藤蔓，将他们缠住。带刺的植被会持续一分钟，痛苦地切割和扎根那些被卷入其中的人，使木偶能够到达目标。",
	"Wood golems are often encountered as guards in elven cities or druid homes. A few, now overgrown with vegetation, still endlessly guard forgotten elven crypts, tombs, and ruins.": "在精灵族的城市或德鲁伊的家中，经常会遇到木头怪兽作为守卫。有一些现在已经长满了植物，仍然无休止地守护着被遗忘的精灵墓穴、坟墓和废墟。",
	"At first glance, the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing appears nothing more than an old tree stump with a deep gash, with several exposed roots extending from its base. Often resting on top of its stump is a small creature, such as a furry mammal or bird. This appearance is all a ruse, however, as the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is a vicious hunter. If inspected closely, one will notice that the deep gash, which is filled with rows of sharp poisonous thorns, is the creature's mouth. The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses its roots like tentacles to move and snatch prey.": "乍一看，披着羊皮的狼只不过是一个老树桩，上面有一个很深的伤口，有几个暴露的根系从它的底部延伸出来。在它的树桩顶上，往往休息着一个小动物，比如说一只毛茸茸的哺乳动物或鸟。然而，这种外表都是一种诡计，因为披着羊皮的狼是一个邪恶的猎手。如果仔细观察，就会发现那条布满了一排排锋利的毒刺的深沟，就是这个生物的嘴巴。绵羊的衣服上的狼用它的根像触角一样来移动和抢夺猎物。",
	"The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing has a unique trait that makes it a very successful ambush predator. It has a strange organ inside its body that it can push out on top of its 'head.' This organ can then transform and mimic a small creature that the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing has eaten. This mimic is then used as a lure, manipulated to move and twitch, in conjunction with the creature's Mimicry ability, to make it look alive in order to draw the attention of would-be prey. A few have become crafty enough to create small sleeping humanoids and place enticing items beside them to would-be robbers.": "披着羊皮的狼有一个独特的特征，使它成为非常成功的伏击捕食者。它的身体里有一个奇怪的器官，可以在它的'头'顶上推出来。这个器官可以转化并模仿绵羊衣狼吃过的小动物。然后，这个模仿物被用作诱饵，被操纵着移动和抽动，结合生物的模仿能力，使它看起来像活的，以吸引可能的猎物的注意。少数人已经变得足够狡猾，可以创造出小型的沉睡人形生物，并在其旁边放置诱人的物品，以吸引可能的强盗。",
	"The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing lives where it can blend in naturally with its surroundings and where prey is plentiful. Thus, it is often encountered in forests, swamps, and other areas where there is dense foliage and undergrowth. It is normally a solitary creature, but a few have been known to tolerate the presence of black duwendes, harpies, and tikbalangs. These creatures lure victims to the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing, which does the dirty work. Once the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing has fed, they carefully scoop up any valuable spoils that the wolf-in- sheep's-clothing discards. As long as they keep the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing fed, it leaves them alone.": "披着羊皮的狼生活在能够自然融入周围环境和猎物丰富的地方。因此，它经常在森林、沼泽和其他有茂密树叶和灌木丛的地方遇到。它通常是一种孤独的生物，但也有少数人知道可以容忍黑杜温德、哈皮斯和提克巴朗斯的存在。这些生物将受害者引诱到披着羊皮的狼的身边，由它来完成肮脏的工作。一旦穿羊皮的狼吃饱了，它们就会小心翼翼地把穿羊皮的狼丢弃的任何有价值的战利品挖出来。只要他们让羊群中的狼吃饱了，狼就会放过他们。",

Not long after, they became very ill. Experiencing excruciating pain and at the edge of death, they reached out to their false gods, imploring them to end their suffering.

	"At first glance, a shocker lizard looks like an ordinary wild lizard. It earns its monicker for being able to unleash powerful electrical energies from its body. Its head is bullet-shaped, framed by two large horns that curve to its back. The shocker lizard's scales range from blue to teal in color, with the hue becoming paler to the point of being gray on its underside.

	"The shocker lizard generates large electric currents through a highly specialized nervous system that works in tandem with its unique electric organ. This act is often triggered when it feels highly stressed, such as being threatened or in pain. It can also be triggered if it detects a nearby shocker lizard discharging electricity. Even though the electrical shock does not harm it, it has evolved to learn how to chain the electrical shocks to maximize its coverage. The most common shocker lizard encountered can generate 15-foot radius waves of electricity. Larger ones can generate even bigger and more powerful waves of electrical currents.

	"Shocker lizards live in warm and temperate caves, coastlines, forests, and swamps where their prey is plentiful. They usually hunt bugs, fish, reptiles, and rodents but they have been known to bring down even larger prey.

The wortlings, acting like a raiding party, descend on the settlement, incapacitating and capturing as many creatures as possible and carry them back alive to be devoured by the orcwort. The process is repeated until the orcwort has fed enough or it is time for it to hibernate. The orcwort then uproots itself and wanders for days until it finds a suitable spot to hibernate.

	"The obliviax, also known as the memory moss, is an evil, sentient plant that resembles a thick patch of dark green moss with endlessly undulating leaves. The obliviax does not require sunlight to grow, though it needs it to trigger its spore reproduction. It is found in temperate climates where it has enough sunshine to grow and reproduce, sprouting on tree trunks, logs, damp cavern floors, or rotting leaves. It may form colonies with others of its kind.": "遗忘者，又称记忆苔藓，是一种邪恶的、有知觉的植物，类似于一片厚厚的深绿色苔藓，有着无尽的起伏的叶子。遗忘者不需要阳光来生长，尽管它需要阳光来触发其孢子繁殖。它被发现在温带气候中，那里有足够的阳光来生长和繁殖，在树干、原木、潮湿的洞穴地面或腐烂的树叶上发芽。它可能与其他同类形成殖民地。",
	"Like moss, the obliviax absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves. However, it also feeds on psychic energy. It does this by stealing magical memories, or spells, from spellcasting creatures. It converts these magical memories into psychic energy, which it then absorbs. When a spellcaster comes within 60 feet of it, the obliviax can attempt to steal one memorized spell from the target by using its Steal Magical Memory. If successful, the spellcaster loses memory of the spell, as if it had already cast it. Once it has a spell stolen, the obliviax can change its shape, imitating the form (up to Medium size) of the spellcasting creature from whom it stole the spell. The new form appears as a clone of the spellcaster, except made completely of moss. Once in this form, the obliviax can cast the spells it has stolen. When it detects a creature that can cast spells, the obliviax will eerily quiver in anticipation and slowly crawl toward it.": "像苔藓一样，遗忘者通过其叶子吸收水和营养。然而，它也以精神能量为食。它通过窃取施法生物的魔法记忆或法术来实现这一目的。它将这些魔法记忆转化为精神能量，然后将其吸收。当一个施法者靠近它60英尺以内时，遗忘者可以通过使用它的偷取魔法记忆来试图从目标身上偷取一个记忆中的咒语。如果成功，施法者就会失去对该咒语的记忆，就像它已经施展过一样。一旦盗取了一个法术，遗忘者可以改变自己的形状，模仿它盗取法术的施法者的形状（最大尺寸为中等）。新的形态看起来就像施法者的复制体，只不过完全由苔藓构成。一旦进入这个形态，遗忘者就可以施展它所窃取的法术。当它探测到一个可以施法的生物时，obliviax会阴森森地颤抖着期待着，并慢慢地爬向它。",
	"Creatures such as bullywugs, grimlocks, kobolds, nothics, troglodytes, and trolls that don't have spellcasting members in their tribes sometimes cultivate obliviaxes. These creatures grow the obliviaxes in the periphery of their encampment or lairs as a defense against magic-users, even occasionally feeding them a captured spellcaster. Some myconid communities have been known to cohabitate with obliviaxes, using them against drow raiders. Certain evil druids and hags have also learned to control and bend obliviaxes to their will and use them as sentries and traps.": "诸如恶霸、巫师、哥布林、野人、巨魔等部落中没有法术成员的生物，有时也会种植遗忘者。这些生物在其营地或巢穴的外围种植遗忘者，作为对魔法使用者的一种防御，甚至偶尔会给被俘的施法者喂食。据了解，一些菌类社区与遗忘者同居，用它们来对付鸦人的突袭者。某些邪恶的德鲁伊和女巫也学会了控制和屈服于他们的意志，把他们当作哨兵和陷阱。",
	"The master rules over all nosferatu in a given region. It is an ancient, malevolent, and powerful undead being. It is the oldest of all nosferatu, often the blood parent or origin of the alphas that serve it, and is revered by its kind. Unlike other nosferatu, the master is fully lucid, can control its feral instincts, and has bat-like wings, making it very dangerous.": "主人统治着某一地区的所有诺斯费拉图。它是一种古老的、邪恶的、强大的不死生物。它是所有诺斯费拉图中最古老的，通常是为它服务的字母的血亲或起源，并受到同类的尊敬。与其他诺斯费拉图不同，主人是完全清醒的，可以控制其野性的本能，并且拥有蝙蝠般的翅膀，使其非常危险。",
	"An alpha is the leader of a nosferatu pack and is often the progenitor of its members. The alpha exhibits greater cunning, strength, and resilience. The alpha, unlike its kind, is capable of prolonged lucid thinking and can keep its bloodthirsty urges in check long enough to have a decent conversation.": "首领是诺斯费拉图族群的领导者，通常是其成员的祖先。首领表现出更大的狡猾、力量和适应力。与它的同类不同，首领能够进行长时间的清醒思考，并能控制其嗜血的冲动，足以进行一次体面的谈话。",
	"At first glance, the noran appears as an ordinary petrified tree full of knots and holes. What gives it away is its face growing out of the trunk, with two eyelids and a mouth filled with teeth that look like crudely-sharpened wooden stakes. Above the noran's face is a hollow but sturdy 4-foot long, 2-foot diameter branch. The noran also possesses three prehensile branches, each ending in long sharp claws. The noran can move, albeit slowly, by crawling on the ground with its thick stubby roots. It is normally found at the edges of bogs, gloomy forests, and swamps, where it can blend easily. A few have also been discovered living deep within the Underdark.": "乍一看，诺兰似乎是一棵普通的石化树，上面布满了节和洞。它的脸是从树干中长出来的，有两片眼皮，嘴里长满了牙齿，看起来像粗糙的削尖的木桩。诺兰的脸部上方是一根空心但坚固的4英尺长、2英尺直径的树枝。诺兰人还拥有三根无柄的树枝，每根树枝的末端都有长长的锋利的爪子。诺兰可以移动，尽管速度很慢，但它可以用粗壮的根茎在地上爬行。它通常被发现在沼泽、阴暗的森林和沼泽的边缘，在那里它可以很容易地融入。也有一些被发现生活在暗黑世界的深处。",
	"The noran is an aggressive carnivorous creature. While it still needs water and soil nutrients, it is nourished mainly by meat. The noran is usually an ambush hunter, waiting for prey to wander close to it. Once its target is within range, the noran explodes into action, attacking with its powerful claws at blinding speed. Most victims are torn to pieces by the initial assault. Those that manage to survive are grappled by the noran and bitten until it is dead.": "诺兰是一种积极的肉食性生物。虽然它仍然需要水和土壤养分，但它主要靠肉来滋养。诺兰通常是一个埋伏的猎手，等待猎物游荡到它身边。一旦目标进入射程，诺兰就会爆发行动，用它强大的爪子以惊人的速度进行攻击。大多数受害者在最初的攻击中被撕成了碎片。那些侥幸存活下来的人被诺兰抓住，并被咬伤，直到死亡。",
	"What makes the noran deadly is its ability to shoot rocks from its hollow cannon-like branch located above its face. The noran has a body organ that can trap and heat air, allowing it to build pressure within its trunk cavity until it decides to release it. If the noran has a rock loaded within its cannon's aperture, it can release the built-up pressure and shoot the rock with tremendous power. The noran can aim the rock accurately at distances of 120 feet. Most prey are instantly killed by the rock's blow which is strong enough to shatter bone and break spinal columns. Those that survive are either stunned or knocked {@condition unconscious}, giving the noran ample time to reach it.": "诺兰的致命之处在于它能从位于脸部上方的空心大炮般的树枝上射出石块。诺兰有一个身体器官，可以捕获和加热空气，让它在树干腔内建立压力，直到它决定释放压力。如果诺兰在它的大炮孔中装了一块石头，它就可以释放积聚的压力，以巨大的力量射出石头。诺兰可以在120英尺的距离内准确瞄准岩石。大多数猎物会被岩石的打击瞬间杀死，它的力量足以击碎骨头和打断脊柱。那些幸存下来的猎物要么被击晕，要么被击倒（%0%），给了诺兰人足够的时间去接近它。",
	"The noran, said to be distantly related to treants, is an intelligent tree that understands the value of coin and treasure. The noran usually collect them, keeping them within its cavity. It may be a voracious predator, but it is intelligent enough to recognize mutually beneficial arrangements. As long as it is paid and fed well, it can be hired to serve as a sentry. While the noran itself isn't an evil creature, it has been known to associate with green dragons, hags, harpies, malignos, quicklings, redcaps, and tikbalangs.": "诺兰，据说与树人有远亲关系，是一种聪明的树，懂得钱币和财宝的价值。诺兰通常收集它们，把它们放在它的洞穴里。它可能是一个贪婪的掠食者，但它有足够的智慧来识别互利的安排。只要它的报酬和食物充足，它就可以被雇来充当哨兵。虽然诺兰本身并不是一种邪恶的生物，但它已经知道与绿龙、女巫、哈比人、马利诺人、快活人、红帽和提克巴兰人交往。",
	"Mustevals resemble 2-foot tall humanoids with mustelid-like features. They have a slim body covered in soft white fur, with tufted ears, and piercing black eyes.

While most golems tend to be lumbering and ponderous, the mithral golem is deceptively agile and graceful.": "在最强大的巨魔中，米塔尔巨魔有18英尺高，类似于一个巨大的人形。它是由米特拉锻造而成的，米特拉是一种稀有的贵重金属，只在地下世界和法鲁恩的特定山脉中才能找到。大多数巨魔都是笨重的，而米塔尔巨魔却非常灵活，而且很有风度。",
	"The mithral golems were first crafted long ago by dwarven artificers to solve one of their main problems - vulnerability to dragon attack. The dwarves needed a powerful guardian that can withstand and repel an assault of an adult dragon. Thus, the wealthiest and most powerful dwarven kingdoms always have a few mithral golems serving as sentries. The plans for creating mithral golems were a carefully guarded secret kept by the dwarves. However, an enterprising master thief was able to steal and make copies of it, selling them to the highest bidders. Despite the availability of the knowledge to craft them, mithral golems are very rare as they are costly and difficult to build. A few are rumored to still stand guard over ancient and forgotten dwarven royal crypts and treasure vaults.": "米塔尔石膏护身符是很久以前由矮人工匠首次制作的，以解决他们的一个主要问题--易受龙的攻击。矮人需要一个强大的守护者，能够抵御和击退成年龙的攻击。因此，最富有和最强大的矮人王国总是有几只米塔尔巨兽作为哨兵。制造米特拉尔巨兽的计划是矮人精心保守的秘密。然而，一个有进取心的盗贼大师能够偷取并复制它，并将它们卖给出价最高的人。尽管有制作它们的知识，但由于成本高且难以制造，米塔尔石膏手杖非常罕见。有几个传言说仍然在守卫着古老而被遗忘的矮人皇家墓穴和宝库。",

Those unfortunate enough to be gripped by the golem are bludgeoned or smashed against each other.": "初次遇到米塔尔巨魔的冒险者往往会对它的敏捷性感到惊讶，因为米塔尔巨魔每回合都可以进行一次额外的行动。那些不幸被巨魔抓住的人，会被打得遍体鳞伤，或者互相撞击。",
	"Despite their plant-like appearance, engkantos are actually mighty fey spirits that dwell in the Material Plane. They were once humanoids who died in ancient enchanted forests and, through Feywild magic or by a nature deity's intervention, were reincarnated into engkantos. They may not fully recall their mortal life, but engkantos will occasionally see glimpses of their past. This sometimes leaves engkantos confused and even frustrated. Thankfully, the forest where it now lives gives enkantos a sense of peace. In return, the engkantos become its mighty guardian.": "尽管他们的外表像植物，但engkantos实际上是居住在物质世界的强大的精灵。他们曾经是死在古代魔法森林中的人类，通过精灵世界的魔法或自然神的干预，转世为engkantos。他们可能不会完全回忆起他们的凡人生活，但engkantos偶尔会看到他们过去的一瞥。这有时会让engkantos感到困惑，甚至感到沮丧。值得庆幸的是，它现在居住的森林给了engkantos一种和平的感觉。作为回报，engkantos成为它强大的守护者。",
	"Engkantos tend to be reclusive and very rarely show themselves to nonwoodland dwellers. However, they are fascinated with the humanoids who live near their territories, perhaps because it reminds them of their past.

	"Engkantos see themselves as protectors and wardens of the forests and its inhabitants and often work with druids. Because of this, they often come into conflict with those who enter, encroach, and defile their territories, which can span miles of wooded areas, though how they react and pursue a course of action dramatically differs from one another. There are three types of engkantos: anitos, diwatas, and malignos.": "Engkantos认为自己是森林及其居民的保护者和守护者，并经常与德鲁伊合作。正因为如此，他们经常与那些进入、侵犯和玷污他们领地的人发生冲突，他们的领地可以跨越数英里的林区，尽管他们的反应和追求的行动方案彼此之间有很大的不同。有三种类型的engkantos：anitos、diwatas和malignos。",
	"Engkantos are bound to a special grove or group of trees, just like a dryad is bound to a tree. An engkanto can emerge from any of the trees within its grove and travel the lands around it, but the grove remains its home and roots the enkanto to the Material Plane. As long as one tree from the grove remains alive and unharmed, the engkanto stays healthy. If any of the trees are harmed, the engkanto suffers. If the grove is ever destroyed, the engkanto descends into madness and will seek vengeance against those responsible.": "Engkantos被束缚在一个特殊的树林或树群中，就像干尸被束缚在一棵树上一样。一个engkanto可以从它的小树林里的任何一棵树里出来，并在它周围的土地上旅行，但小树林仍然是它的家，并使engkanto扎根于物质世界。只要小树林中的一棵树还活着并且没有受到伤害，engkanto就能保持健康。如果任何一棵树受到伤害，engkanto就会受到影响。如果丛林被毁，engkanto就会陷入疯狂，并寻求对责任人的报复。",
	"If a depraved and misanthropic humanoid who has done countless atrocities against its own kind dies in an accursed forest, a deity like Auril, Malar, or the Queen of Air and Darkness may reincarnate it as a maligno, an insidious and malevolent engkanto.

	"Sometimes mistaken for a verbeeg or ogre, the kapre is a large fey that resembles a muscular 8-foot tall humanoid with long, wild black hair and yellow eyes that glow in the dark.

	"Similar to a dryad, the kapre is bound to its tree. It can emerge from the tree at night and explore the lands around it, but the tree remains as its home. Such a tree grows healthier and more prominent than the other trees around it.

	"At night, one would see fireflies from the kapre's tree. These fireflies are actually embers from the kapre's pipe, accompanied by smoke and the sweet smell of dried tobacco leaves. The kapre does this to possibly lure individuals to its tree. While remaining invisible, it will observe, eavesdrop, or play pranks on them. Those who have fallen victim to the kapre's pranks describe the experience of becoming confused, forgetful, and unable to get away from the tree. From time to time, due to its curiosity or a simple desire for intelligent conversation, the kapre will leave its tree and venture out at night, always in the form of a small beast, such as a cat or dog, hoping that it would attract the attention of someone that would pet it.": "到了晚上，人们会从卡普雷的树上看到萤火虫。这些萤火虫实际上是卡普雷烟斗的余烬，伴随着烟雾和干烟叶的甜味。卡普雷这样做可能是为了引诱人们到它的树上。在保持隐形的情况下，它将观察、偷听，或对他们进行恶作剧。那些成为卡普雷恶作剧受害者的人描述了他们的经历：变得困惑、健忘、无法离开这棵树。不时地，由于它的好奇心或对智慧对话的简单渴望，卡普雷会离开它的树，在晚上冒险出去，总是以小动物的形式，如猫或狗，希望它能吸引某人的注意，并抚摸它。",
	"The kapre is fascinated with humans, particularly of the opposite sex. Sometimes, if the kapre finds a person it is observing attractive or interesting, it would reveal its true self. Those that manage to overcome their fears of meeting a kapre and become friends with it describe the kapre as a great storyteller who regales them with funny and wondrous anecdotes from the Feywild. Unfortunately, a kapre also tends to be obsessive. A smitten kapre, if spurned, may resort to stalking the person it desires. The kapre becomes very possessive and protective that any potential suitors of its target are dealt with immediately. These hapless victims soon find themselves suddenly lost, unable to find their way home, and cursed to wander the woods until they starve to death. Eventually, the kapre may become desperate and resort to abducting the object of its affection and bringing it to its Feywild home. There the kapre keeps the kidnapped victim as its slave and prisoner, never letting it go until it dies or it gets tired of it.": "卡普雷对人类很着迷，特别是对异性。有时，如果卡普雷发现它所观察的人很有吸引力或很有趣，它就会暴露出自己的真实身份。那些设法克服遇到卡普雷的恐惧并与之成为朋友的人，会把卡普雷描述成一个伟大的说书人，向他们讲述精灵世界的有趣和奇妙的轶事。不幸的是，卡普雷也倾向于迷恋。一个被迷住的卡普雷，如果被拒绝，可能会诉诸于跟踪它所渴望的人。卡普雷变得非常有占有欲，并保护其目标的任何潜在求婚者立即被解决。这些无助的受害者很快就会发现自己突然迷失了方向，找不到回家的路，并被诅咒在森林里游荡，直到饿死。最后，卡普雷可能会变得绝望，并采取绑架其爱慕的对象并将其带到其Feywild的家中。在那里，卡普雷将被绑架的受害者作为它的奴隶和囚犯，永远不会让它离开，直到它死或它厌倦了它。",
	"A kapre can be a dangerous adversary in combat. Aside from it being as strong as an ogre, it is a cunning trickster that can curse and distract its foes with its spells. Worse still, the smoke the kapre can exhale can magically distort creatures' perceptions. Anyone caught within it can suffer from a number of different debilitating effects, leaving them vulnerable to the kapre.": "卡普雷在战斗中可以成为一个危险的对手。除了像食人魔一样强壮之外，它还是一个狡猾的骗子，可以用它的法术诅咒和分散敌人的注意力。更糟糕的是，卡普雷所吐出的烟雾可以神奇地扭曲生物的感知力。任何被卷入其中的人都会受到一些不同的衰弱影响，使他们容易受到卡普雷的伤害。",

	"The purple dragon, also called deep dragon by some, is native to the Underdark. It has a slender, serpentine neck and an armored, elongated head with a crest of swept-back sharp spikes. Its scales range from iridescent amethyst and deep purple to dark eggplant violet as it ages. Its sinewy, flexible body possesses powerful limbs and talon-tipped wings and moves like a hunting cat, which helps it navigate, squeeze through, and traverse the Underdark's endless narrow crevices and stalactite-filled caverns undetected with ease.": "紫色的龙，也有人称之为深龙，原产于暗黑世界。它有一个细长的蛇形颈部，一个装甲的、修长的头部，上面有一个后掠的尖锐尖刺的徽章。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片从五彩的紫水晶和深紫色到深茄子紫。它蜿蜒灵活的身体拥有强大的四肢和带爪子的翅膀，行动起来就像一只狩猎的猫，这有助于它在暗黑世界无尽的狭窄缝隙和充满钟乳石的洞穴中轻松导航、挤压和穿越而不被发现。",
	"The purple dragon enjoys the thrill of the hunt, just like gray dragons. Whereas gray dragons take down prey with fierce brutality, the purple dragon attacks with calculated efficiency, stalking its prey patiently for hours and striking before its target becomes aware of its presence. The purple dragon is so deathly quiet that it can pick off members of a dwarven patrol one by one without alerting the others. Its breath attack is a billowing cloud of psychotropic vapor that disrupts and impairs a creature's acuity and cognitive abilities.": "紫龙享受狩猎的快感，就像灰龙一样。灰龙以凶残的方式击倒猎物，而紫龙则以精打细算的效率进行攻击，它耐心地跟踪猎物数小时，在目标意识到它的存在之前进行攻击。紫龙是如此的死寂，以至于它可以在不惊动其他人的情况下将矮人巡逻队的成员一个个地干掉。它的呼吸攻击是一团波涛汹涌的精神蒸汽，可以扰乱和损害生物的敏锐度和认知能力。",
	"A purple dragon tolerates drow and sees them as allies with many resources it can exploit. It hates dwarves, including duergar, because they craft armor out of its scales. It despises {@creature balhannoth|MPMM|balhannoths}, {@creature cloaker|MM|cloakers}, {@creature deepspawn|MonsterManualExpanded3|deepspawns}, and mind flayers because it sees them as competition for dominance in the Underdark. It is always fascinated with surface dwellers and will stalk and study them for days before deciding whether to kill, parley with, steal from, or leave alone. While the purple dragon can eat almost anything edible, it is very fond of giant specimens of cavefishes, crabs, crayfishes, as well as {@creature kuo-toa|MM|kuo-toans}, {@creature chuul|MM|chuuls}, and {@creature aboleth|MM|aboleths}.": "紫龙容忍乌鸦，并将其视为拥有许多可以利用的资源的盟友。它憎恨矮人，包括杜尔加，因为他们用它的鳞片制作盔甲。它鄙视{@creature balhannoth|MPMM|balhannoths}、{@creature cloaker|MM|cloakers}、{@creature deepspawn|MonsterManualExpanded3|deepspawns}和心灵感应者，因为它认为他们是在暗黑世界中争夺统治权的竞争对手。它对地表居民总是很着迷，会跟踪研究他们好几天，然后再决定是杀死他们、与他们谈判、从他们那里偷东西，还是放过他们。虽然紫龙几乎可以吃任何可食用的东西，但它非常喜欢巨大的洞穴鱼、螃蟹、小龙虾，以及（3%）、（4%）和（5%）的标本。",
	"When an illithid colony captures a live dragon wyrmling, it is brought to the elder brain. If the colony is thriving, the wyrmling is destroyed. If, however, the colony is in dire straits, the elder brain may decide the unthinkable and have the wyrmling undergo ceremorphosis, the process of transforming a creature into an illithid. In this case, the wyrmling transforms into an illithidragon. To ensure the illithidragon does not become a threat to the colony, the elder brain stunts the growth of the illithidragon at the very start of the process, preventing the illithidragon from reaching the age and size of an ancient dragon.": "当一个Illithid殖民地捕获了一个活的龙威姆林时，它被带到长老会。如果这个族群正在蓬勃发展，那么这只龙王就会被销毁。然而，如果龙群处于困境，长老会可能会做出不可思议的决定，让这只暴龙接受蜕变，也就是把一个生物转化为一个illithid的过程。在这种情况下，暴龙就会转变为illithidragon。为了确保illithidragon不会成为殖民地的威胁，长老的大脑在这个过程一开始就阻止了illithidragon的生长，防止illithidragon达到古龙的年龄和大小。",
	"The illithidragon tends to be loyal and subservient to the elder brain, serving the colony as its primary guardian. As it ages, however, its draconic nature of being selfish, egotistical, and superior rears up, and the elder brain starts to lose control over the illithidragon. As soon as this happens, the colony is ordered to destroy the illithidragon. However, the illithidragon is often already aware that it has become a threat to the elder brain and either escapes into the Underdark to begins its life anew, or destroys the elder brain, subjugates the colony, and installs itself as the new master.": "幻影龙倾向于对长老的大脑忠诚和服从，作为其主要监护人为殖民地服务。然而，随着年龄的增长，它自私、自负、高高在上的龙族本性开始抬头，长老的大脑开始失去对illithidragon的控制。一旦发生这种情况，殖民地就会被命令摧毁illithidragon。然而，illithidragon往往已经意识到自己已经成为长老会的威胁，它要么逃到地下世界，重新开始自己的生活，要么摧毁长老会，征服族群，自己成为新主人。",
	"Just like mind flayers, an illithidragon is a depraved schemer and manipulator, enslaving weaker Underdark races to further its goals of amassing wealth, domination, and survival.

It hates and avoids other dragons, as they see its kind as an abomination that must be destroyed.": "就像心智分裂者一样，幻影龙是一个堕落的阴谋家和操纵者，它奴役弱小的暗黑世界种族，以促进其积累财富、统治和生存的目标。就像噬心者一样，它以其他生物的大脑为生。然而，它可以吃任何智能生物的大脑，不仅仅是人类。它憎恨并躲避其他龙，因为它们认为它的同类是必须被摧毁的可恶之物。",
	"In combat, an illithidragon attacks its foes with its grasping tentacles and raking claws. If it manages to incapacitate a creature, it will try to extract its brain. Unlike dragons, an illithidragon has lost its breath attack ability. However, it can emit psychic energy waves just like a mind flayer.": "在战斗中，幻影龙会用它那抓人的触手和耙子的爪子攻击它的敌人。如果它成功地使一个生物失去能力，它将试图提取其大脑。与龙不同，幻影龙失去了呼吸攻击的能力。然而，它可以像噬心者一样发出精神能量波。",
	"As part of her agreement of being a subservient champion of Asmodeus, Tiamat the Dragon Queen provided the Supreme Master of the Nine Hells some of her eggs. The eggs were brought to Mephistopheles and infused with Asmodeus's blood. The dragons born from these eggs were raised to become draconic agents loyal to Asmodeus and the ruling archdevils of the Nine Hells. These dragons became known as hellfire wyrms. To ensure the hellfire wyrms would not pose a threat to her, Tiamat deliberately cursed each egg. The cursed hellfire wyrm, no matter how old it was, would not grow to the size of an ancient dragon. Still, every hellfire wyrm, while subservient to the archdevils, recognize Tiamat as their mother and remain reverent to her.": "作为她成为阿斯莫德征服者的协议的一部分，龙后提亚马特向九层地狱的最高主人提供了一些她的蛋。这些蛋被带到了梅菲斯特，并注入了阿斯莫德的血液。从这些龙蛋中诞生的龙被培养成忠于阿斯莫德和九幽地狱统治者的龙族特工。这些龙被称为地狱火巫妖。为了确保地狱火龙不会对她构成威胁，提亚马特故意诅咒了每一颗龙蛋。被诅咒的地狱火龙，无论它有多大，都不会长到古龙的大小。尽管如此，每个地狱火巫妖在服从大恶魔的同时，都承认提亚马特是它们的母亲，并对她保持敬畏之心。",
	"From afar, the hellfire wyrm is often mistaken for a red dragon. As one gets close to it, however, its supernatural aura and diabolical characteristics become more noticeable. It features osteodermic spikes protruding from its head and shoulders and a row of sharp bony spines run from the back of its head to the tip of its tail. Its scales continuously shift in the colors of flowing molten lava and its eyes burn with infernal intensity. The hellfire wyrm can also change its form to that of a tiefling or any Medium-sized devil. It prefers its tiefling form, though, where the once fearsome hellfire wyrm effortlessly becomes a charming, endearing, polite, and eloquent creature. It is probably these traits, and its ability to magically disguise itself, that make the hellfire wyrm even more dangerous.": "从远处看，地狱火巫妖经常被误认为是一条红龙。然而，当人们靠近它时，它的超自然的光环和邪恶的特征就会变得更加明显。它的特点是头部和肩部都有骨刺突出，一排尖锐的骨刺从头顶一直延伸到尾巴的顶端。它的鳞片不断变换着流动的熔岩的颜色，它的眼睛燃烧着地狱般的强度。地狱之火巫妖也可以改变其形态，变成铁弗林或任何中等大小的魔鬼。不过它更喜欢铁弗林的形态，曾经可怕的地狱火巫妖毫不费力地变成了一个迷人的、可爱的、有礼貌的和能言善辩的生物。可能正是这些特征，以及它神奇地伪装自己的能力，使地狱火狼人变得更加危险。",
	"The hellfire wyrm is sent to the Material Plane to insert itself into numerous powerful kingdoms and live among the humanoid races for an indefinite time, assuming different identities until it establishes itself successfully and secures a position of power, such as a chancellor, magistrate, or treasurer. In these roles, a hellfire wyrm can secretly influence and corrupt monarchs, people of high stations, and those in key, strategic positions to pursue actions and make decisions that align with the goals of its archdevil master or send as many souls possible to the Nine Hells, such as commit despotic acts and start unnecessary wars. The hellfire wyrm always makes these moves very carefully and takes utmost care to hide its diabolical nature. Anyone who becomes even remotely suspicious of the hellfire wyrm's true identity or actions is quickly and quietly eliminated by the dragon. The hellfire wyrm will only reveal its true draconic form if its life is in peril and it can't escape.": "地狱火暴君被派往物质世界，插入众多强大的王国，并无限期地生活在类人种族中，扮演不同的身份，直到它成功地建立自己的地位，并确保一个权力的位置，如宰相、行政官或财务官。在这些角色中，地狱火魔可以秘密地影响和腐蚀君主、高位者和那些处于关键、战略地位的人，使他们采取符合其大恶魔主人目标的行动和决策，或尽可能多地将灵魂送入九层地狱，如实施专制行为和发动不必要的战争。地狱火暴君总是非常小心地做出这些举动，并极其小心地隐藏其邪恶的本质。任何对地狱火龙的真实身份或行动产生怀疑的人，都会被地狱火龙迅速、悄悄地消灭掉。地狱火龙只有在生命处于危险之中并且无法逃脱的情况下，才会暴露出它真正的龙族形态。",
	"In combat, the hellfire wyrm quickly searches for advantages and disadvantages it can exploit, such as the environment or its enemies' weaknesses. It keeps to the air against grounded targets, using only its spells and breath attack until it is confident enough to close in and finish them off. Its breath attack is a powerful cone of hellfire that can turn bone and flesh to ash in an instant. Those few who survive such an onslaught are still left vulnerable to fire and must contend with the hellfire wyrm's next attacks.": "在战斗中，地狱火暴君迅速寻找它可以利用的优势和劣势，如环境或敌人的弱点。它一直在空中对付地面上的目标，只使用它的法术和呼吸攻击，直到它有足够的信心接近并干掉他们。它的呼吸攻击是一个强大的地狱之火锥体，可以在瞬间将骨头和肉体变成灰烬。那些在这样的攻击中幸存下来的少数人仍然容易受到火的伤害，必须与地狱火暴君的下一次攻击抗衡。",
	"The gray dragon is likely the most avaricious, ill-tempered, and feral of all dragons. It lives to hunt for sport, more obsessed with the act of stalking and bringing down powerful prey than accumulating wealth. It is prone to fits of rage such that the gray dragon would rain death and destruction to every random habitat and settlement within miles of its lair. It dwells in temperate regions that have high rocky outcroppings surrounded by low flatlands.": "灰龙可能是所有龙中最贪婪、脾气最坏、最野性的。它以狩猎为生，更痴迷于跟踪和打倒强大的猎物的行为，而不是积累财富。它很容易发怒，以至于灰龙会对其巢穴周围数英里内的每一个随机的栖息地和定居点进行死亡和破坏。它居住在温带地区，那里有高大的岩石，周围是低矮的平地。",
	"The gray dragon is covered in armor-like, bony plates called osteoderms, with spikes protruding from its forearms and limb joints. Its head features a crest of long, sharp spikes, with smaller ones jutting below its oversized jaw like a garish beard. A jagged line of barbs runs from the back of its head and along its spine, and its forked tail ends with two wicked scythe-like bony plates which it uses to impale prey. A fang-filled mouth and a pair of long ears give the gray dragon a bat-like visage.": "灰龙浑身覆盖着类似盔甲的骨质板，称为骨质板，前臂和四肢关节处都有尖刺。它的头部有一个由长而锋利的尖刺组成的峰顶，较小的尖刺在它超大的下巴下面突起，就像一个华丽的胡须。一条锯齿状的倒钩从它的后脑勺沿着脊柱延伸出来，它分叉的尾巴末端有两块邪恶的镰刀状骨板，它用来刺杀猎物。一张充满獠牙的嘴和一对长长的耳朵给了灰龙一个蝙蝠般的面孔。",
	"It is said that gray dragons evolved from fang dragons, an extinct type of bestial dragon that had no breath weapon. Legend has it that Tiamat, the Queen of Dragons, weaved her dark magic and infused all unhatched fang dragon eggs in the world with basilisk blood. Since then, only gray dragon hatchlings have been born, and each has shown a natural affinity with the Elemental nature of Earth, including immunity to petrification.": "据说灰龙是从獠牙龙进化而来的，獠牙龙是一种已经灭绝的兽性龙，没有呼吸武器。传说中，龙后提亚马特编织了她的黑暗魔法，给世界上所有未孵化的獠牙龙蛋注入了玄色的血液。从那时起，只有灰龙的幼崽出生了，而且每个人都表现出与地球元素性质的天然亲和力，包括对石化的免疫力。",
	"Driven by its predatory nature, the gray dragon prefers to fight by just using its teeth, claws, and tail, often delivering the killing blow before its target can react. At times the gray dragon will toy with its prey, tormenting it by telling how futile it is to escape, and even mimicking voices it has heard to distract or lure the target. It sees it as a testament to its hunting prowess to bring down formidable creatures with just its cunning, hunting skill, and physical attacks. Thus, it rarely uses its breath attack unless it believes its life might be in danger. The gray dragon's elemental breath is a cone of caustic, viscous slime. The slime is so sticky that it continues to dissolve the flesh of its victims for a time after the initial contact.": "在捕食本性的驱使下，灰龙更喜欢用它的牙齿、爪子和尾巴来战斗，往往在目标做出反应之前就给它致命一击。有时，灰龙会玩弄它的猎物，通过告诉它逃跑是多么的徒劳来折磨它，甚至模仿它听到的声音来转移或引诱目标。它认为仅凭自己的狡猾、狩猎技巧和物理攻击就能打倒强大的生物，是对其狩猎能力的一种证明。因此，它很少使用它的呼吸攻击，除非它认为自己的生命可能有危险。灰龙的元素气息是一种锥形的腐蚀性粘液。这种粘液非常粘稠，在初次接触后的一段时间内，它还会继续溶解受害者的肉体。",
	"A gray dragon often leaves its lair for extended periods to hunt. Before doing so, it seals its den, where it keeps its vast treasure piles, with boulders and slabs of granite and limestone. The lair's outlying chambers are usually patrolled by the gray dragon's minions, which are often basilisks, cockatrices, earth elementals, galeb duhr, medusae, ooze paraelementals, and stone giants. These creatures are not necessarily subservient to the gray dragon and see it more as a mutual arrangement of protection. However, they do fear the gray dragon's wrath and take extraordinary steps not to incur it.": "灰龙经常长时间离开它的巢穴去狩猎。在这样做之前，它用巨石和花岗岩及石灰石板封住它的巢穴，在那里存放大量的财宝。巢穴的外围房间通常由灰龙的爪牙巡逻，这些爪牙通常是玄武岩、鸡冠石、土元素、加勒布杜尔、梅杜莎、渗水准元素和石巨人。这些生物不一定服从于灰龙，更多的是将其视为一种相互保护的安排。然而，他们确实害怕灰龙的愤怒，并采取特别的措施来避免引起灰龙的愤怒。",
