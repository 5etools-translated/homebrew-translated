Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.": "这些热血动物像猫一样挑逗着它们的受害者，将世界和其中的一切视为它们的合法猎物。年轻的火焰龙比它们的长辈更不含糊。火焰龙可能会强迫一个女人看着她的家人死去，或者毁掉一张漂亮的脸蛋来取乐--直接而邪恶。随着龙的成熟，这种天生的虐待狂发展为对更复杂的运动的渴望。衰老的火龙利用政治、谋杀和魔法进行精心策划，只有他们这类人能够欣赏。许多人创造的阴谋是如此复杂和有层次，以至于他们缺乏真正的解决方案，只创造了无尽的操纵。一个英雄可能会挫败一次暗杀，但却看到因此被拯救的国王成为一个暴君。她可能打败了在统治者耳边吹牛的大臣，却发现他是一个巨大阴谋中的棋子。黑暗的野心、有毒的匕首和旧日的仇怨形成了这样的势头，每当另一个计划结束时，就会有一个计划开始。通常情况下，即使杀死龙族的主谋也无法扑灭其引发的大火。",
	"The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon's land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.": "这些计划的结果是次要的，他们从追求一个模糊的、不断变化的目标中获得了乐趣。有些人花了几个世纪的时间来折磨一个家族，而这只不过是侵入了龙的土地。另一些人在将拙劣的言语扭曲成最可怕的侮辱之后，策划了永恒的诅咒。复仇本身并不重要，重要的是有一个仇恨、阴谋和毁灭的借口。火焰龙喜欢这样的复仇机会，把每一次都看作是一种令人愉快的爱好。游戏的中断点燃了真正可怕的怒火，在这些罕见的失败时刻，他们的愤怒可能是灾难性的。整个城市被烧毁。",
	"Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.": "火焰龙和其他真正的龙一样，都是物质主义者和领土主义者。每条龙都在疯狂地追求自己的执念，以填补自己的囤积物。有些人腐蚀无辜，有些人把国家推向战争，但他们总是为每一次胜利收集纪念品，无论是小事还是大事。一个人可能会收集烧焦的头骨，而另一个人则保存着被推翻的帝国的融化的财物。当不在外面挑拨离间的时候，古老的火焰龙喜欢沉思他们的囤积物。每件东西都会让他们想起自己的威严和天才。",
	"Nothing is safe from a flame dragon's endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon's undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon's death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.": "在火焰龙无休止的阴谋诡计和自恋面前，没有什么是安全的。他们渴望得到绝对的关注和持续的保证。任何羞辱火焰龙的人都会更明智地杀死它。它的生存确保了火焰龙几代人都能得到无微不至的关注。更明智的做法是，确保火焰龙的死亡没有一丝牵连。所有燃烧的巨蛇都把谋杀它们的一个亲属视为最严重的侮辱。",
	"Flame dragons descend from the passionate daughter of the great World Serpent.

She manufactures an outrage when bored, working wildly complex plots against arbitrary enemies until it all ends in death.

Her false affections culminate in a fiery death for the unfortunate object of her attentions. She always leaves some cherished possession untouched by the cremation and builds her hoards with the memories of a thousand murdered champions.": "Glaurvistus，吸烟的祸害，插入许多凡人的事件中，在历史上留下她的印记。她在无聊时制造愤怒，对任意的敌人实施疯狂的复杂阴谋，直到一切以死亡结束。她最喜欢的游戏是承诺崇拜一个坚强的英雄，并给这个人周围的任何力量带来缓慢但具有破坏性的毁灭。她虚假的感情最终会让她关注的不幸对象火速死亡。她总是在火化时留下一些珍贵的财产，并以一千名被谋杀的冠军的记忆来建立她的囤积物。",
	"Glaurvistus has many lairs, most within active volcanoes or deep below the ground. Each boasts unique treasures to lure would-be heroes. She grants many fortresses to her most beloved offspring, who oversee their mother's domain. There is no surer way for a hero to gain her attention than by slaying one of her favored children. Legends claim she lairs in a true sanctuary, accessing the outside world only through magic or caves of molten adamantine.": "格洛维斯特斯有许多巢穴，大多数位于活火山内或地底深处。每个巢穴都拥有独特的宝藏，以引诱未来的英雄们。她将许多堡垒授予她最心爱的后代，由他们监督母亲的领域。对英雄来说，没有比杀死她最宠爱的孩子之一更容易引起她的注意的方法了。传说中，她躲在一个真正的避难所里，只有通过魔法或熔化的金刚砂洞穴才能进入外部世界。",
	"The Smoking Scourge recognizes few rivals. She views most dragons as children and offers grudging esteem only to the oldest and most powerful. She greets her immediate siblings with familial respect but considers them all beneath her. From her spawn she demands obedience, and her regard is only earned with constant success. She expects immediate discarding of centuries-long plots at her merest whim, and the price for disloyalty is a terrible vengeance.": "吸烟的祸害几乎不认得对手。她视大多数龙为孩子，只对最年长和最强大的龙给予勉强的尊重。她对她的直系兄弟姐妹表示尊重，但认为他们都在她之下。她要求她的孩子们服从，只有不断的成功才能赢得她的尊重。她期待着在她最短的时间内立即抛弃长达几个世纪的阴谋，而不忠的代价就是可怕的报复。",
	"The oldest of her children see patterns over centuries, and they wonder whether Glaurvistus pursues some greater goal they cannot fathom. All creation is her plaything.": "她最年长的孩子们看到了几个世纪以来的模式，他们想知道格洛维斯特是否在追求一些他们无法理解的更大目标。所有的创造都是她的玩物。",

It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.": "虚空龙是知识渊博的生物，但它们已经看到了太多，在虚空本身的边缘徘徊。凝视着外面打着哈欠的虚无，已经付出了代价。虚空龙带着那虚无的一部分，它慢慢地吞噬了它们的存在。他们都是不正常的，他们的疯狂是可以传染的。当虚空龙陷入愤怒并大发雷霆的时候，它就会从它们身上流淌出来，打破较小生命的思想。",
	"Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures.

	"Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.": "风龙将任何被空气触及的地方都视为自己的财产，而凡人则将其视为傲慢的缩影。他们的自恋不是没有原因的，因为令人敬畏的力量支持他们对合法控制权的主张。对变幻莫测的大风之龙来说，力量是最终的仲裁者。虽然风龙小龙是新生龙中最弱的，但它们的力量增长很快，很少有完全长大的龙被视为更强。",
	"Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it's unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.": "风龙是凡间生物中最大的欺凌者和最坏的暴君之一。这些有时很愚蠢的生物对任何感知到的挑战都会采取人身攻击，并对羞辱对手感到非常高兴。他们声称拥有大片的领土，但对其管理却不屑一顾，他们把领土上的凡人视为财产。臣子们只得到可疑的保护，以换取坚定不移的忠诚。风龙可能会因为追随者被杀而寻求血腥的报复，但它不可能不顾一切地首先阻止生命的丧失。",
	"Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.": "有些人认为，风之龙的要求远远超过了他们所能控制或巡逻的范围。因为他们非常喜欢高空，所以他们更喜欢在现有的最高点进行统治并与地上的祈求者会面：大山的山顶或由可怕的奴隶建立的高耸的纪念碑上。但这些龙也被游荡的欲望所驱使，经常远离他们的王位。他们最终总会回来，准备征服新的一代，并将暴虐的爪子按在任何质疑其统治权的人的脖子上。",
	"These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death.

	"Wind dragons much prefer to fight from the air, and can be effective with spells and breath weapons there. However, this can be quite frustrating for parties without ranged attacks, and even then, ancient dragons are immune to non-magical ranged attacks and adult wind dragons impose disadvantage.

Wind dragons are designed to soften up foes at range, and then swoop in for the kill in melee, carrying off one or more victims.": "风龙更喜欢从空中作战，在那里可以有效地使用法术和呼吸武器。然而，对于没有远程攻击的一方来说，这可能是相当令人沮丧的，即使如此，古龙对非魔法的远程攻击是免疫的，而成年风龙则会施加不利因素。同样重要的是，风龙自身的传奇行动和它的多重攻击都需要更接近和处于近战。风龙被设计成在范围内软化敌人，然后在近战中俯冲杀敌，带走一个或多个受害者。",
	"Wind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can't pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.": "风龙把它们的巢穴建在可以俯瞰和支配它们声称是自己的土地的地方，但又足够偏远，这样居民就不能用保护或正义的请求来纠缠它们。它们几乎不惧怕外界环境，所以在暴露的山面高处的浅洞是最理想的。风龙喜欢点缀着岩石尖顶和高大陡峭的悬崖的高处，在那里，风龙可以栖息在呼啸的风中，捕捉掠过峡谷和撕裂峭壁的交错的上升和下降气流。非飞行的生物发现这些地方不那么好客。",

	"As the eons passed, Arbeyach's interests and ambitions deviated further from those of the Hellish lords around him. He grows ever more unyielding, ever more alien. Eventually, those below and those above him expelled the Prince of Swarms from power; none can say whether Arbeyach allowed himself to be deposed.

	"Quick and canny, a chort devil uses varied, pleasing forms to entice mortals to make terrible bargains, but it revels in its obvious devilishness. A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive those whom it bargains with. After all, the chort affirms, if the victim weren't so desperate, he wouldn't be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the creature is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, since that voids any potential contract.": "Chort魔鬼敏捷而狡猾，它用各种悦目的形式来引诱凡人进行可怕的交易，但它却陶醉于自己明显的魔鬼气质。Chort希望它的受害者知道它在和一个魔鬼打交道。这种相对直截了当的方式使该生物能够更好地欺骗那些与它讨价还价的人。毕竟，chort肯定地说，如果受害者不是如此绝望，他就不会和魔鬼讨价还价。如果有必要，隐含的死亡威胁会给它带来更大的讨价还价能力，但这个生物很小心，不会折磨或以其他方式伤害它的替身，因为那会使任何潜在的合同失效。",

	"A zealous opponent of the chort often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin's sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it.": "一个热心的反对者经常发现自己是他自己傲慢的受害者，因为魔鬼挖掘或创造了关于它的敌人的卑鄙故事，并使他的愚蠢行为曝光。恶魔喜欢玷污善良工具的声誉。例如，它可能偷了一个圣骑士的剑，用它来谋杀一个特别虔诚的人，把剑留在受害者身上。这样，一个乔特人就打发了一个对它的操纵有强烈抵抗力的敌人，给另一个潜在的敌人带来怀疑，并玷污了一个可能被用来对付它的武器--至少在声誉上。",

	"Jaculi are among the least intelligent of the dragons—but they're still smarter than most humans, and they're known to pursue cunning and complicated plots to build their hoards. Many traditional tales tell of jaculi in the southern forests working as teams to separate merchants and other travelers from their wealth, figuring out ways to abscond with gems and jewelry before the owners even know they've been robbed. Some jaculi may feign docility or even pretend to be friendly and helpful, but wise travelers know that the creatures drop such ruses as soon as they can steal what they're really after.": "雅库利是龙类中智力最低的一种，但它们仍然比大多数人类聪明，而且众所周知，它们追求狡猾和复杂的阴谋来建立自己的囤积物。许多传统的故事告诉我们，南部森林中的贾库里以团队的形式将商人和其他旅行者从他们的财富中分离出来，在他们的主人还没有意识到他们被抢劫之前就想出了携带宝石和珠宝潜逃的方法。有些贾库里可能会假装温顺，甚至假装友好和乐于助人，但聪明的旅行者知道，一旦他们能偷到他们真正想要的东西，这些生物就会放弃这种诡计。",

	"Fiendish pests that infest derelict wizards' towers and laboratories, the kalkes are either the by-product of botched gates into the lower realms or the personification of an evil deity's contempt for wizards. All kalkes act with the arrogance of magi while having the social characteristics of baboons. Being of fiendish blood, kalkes do not age and require neither food nor drink.

	"The drive to produce ever more fanciful rituals gives a kalke the compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia. Although these objects serve no purpose, the kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. Because they have no ability to distinguish what's magically useful from what isn't, they grab any jewelry, pouches, sticks, or ornate objects they uncover. Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away.": "制作更多奇特仪式的动力使卡尔克有了积累法术组件、魔法焦点和其他神秘物品的强迫性。虽然这些东西没有任何作用，但卡尔克会寻找他们附近的施法者，并偷取他们能找到的任何用具。因为他们没有能力区分什么是有用的，什么是没用的，所以他们会抓住任何他们发现的珠宝、小包、棍子或华丽的物品。有时，如果儿童、动物或其他小的人形生物能够被轻易带走，他们就会被带走作为祭品。",
	"Troops of kalkes inhabit trees, caverns, and ruins around sites of significant magical activity. Twice a month, or more during major astrological and seasonal events, the kalkes gather to perform—by way of dance, chant, and sacrifice—an imagined rite of great magic.

	"An additional side effect of these rituals is that the troop may gain or lose members magically. If the troop numbers less than 13, a new kalke appears as if from nowhere; if it contains 13 or more members, then 3d4 of them find themselves mysteriously gated to the nearest location of magical activity—often hundreds of miles away. Those teleported arrive in a state of hysteria, with individuals extinguishing flames, grabbing frippery, and running in all directions. Because kalkes have no control over their displacement, it's not surprising to find them in abandoned dungeons or keeps, clutching the property of some long-lost wizard.": "这些仪式的另一个副作用是，部队可能会神奇地获得或失去成员。如果部队人数少于13人，一个新的卡尔克就会出现，就像从哪里来的一样；如果它包含13个或更多的成员，那么他们中的3d4人就会发现自己被神秘地传送到最近的魔法活动地点--通常是数百英里之外。被传送的人到达时处于一种歇斯底里的状态，有人熄灭了火焰，抓住了装饰品，并向各个方向跑去。因为卡尔基人无法控制他们的位移，所以在废弃的地牢或堡垒中发现他们，攥着某个失散多年的巫师的财产也就不奇怪了。",

After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to plane shift into the space.": "当Kikimora选择一个房子居住时，她会在墙壁、底板、橱柜或半永久性物体（如炉子）上涂抹一个符号，作为她的小领域。这种能力创造了一个隐藏的超维度住所。在创造了一个藏身处之后，Kikimora可以将自己和最多50磅的物体传送到指定的地点，而不是进行正常的移动。这个超维空间只能由Kikimora或使用平面转移法术或能力的生物进入。位置可以通过在符文区域施展侦测魔法来确定，但需要成功地进行{@dc 15}智力({@skill Arcana})检查才能平面转移到这个空间。",

	"Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful shadow roads.

	"If the skein witch fails a saving throw, she may choose to succeed instead and reflect the effect of the failed saving throw onto one enemy within 30 feet.

The new target is entitled to a saving throw as if it were the original target of the attack, but with disadvantage.": "如果骷髅女巫的蓄力动作失败，她可以选择成功，并将蓄力动作失败的效果反射到30英尺内的一个敌人。如果有的话，骷髅女巫仍然会受到蓄力成功的影响。新的目标有资格进行蓄力，就像它是攻击的原始目标一样，但是有劣势。",

	"The skein witch attunes herself to the threads of the PCs' fates. Ask each player to write down their prediction of how the PC to their left will die, and at what level. Collect the notes without revealing the answers. When one of those PCs dies, reveal the prediction. If the character died in the manner predicted, they fulfill their destiny and are immediately resurrected by the gods as a reward. If they died at or within one level of the prediction, they return to life with some useful insight into the destiny of someone important.": "绳索女巫将自己调整到PC的命运线上。要求每个玩家写下他们对自己左边的PC将如何死亡的预测，以及在什么级别。在不透露答案的情况下收集这些笔记。当其中一个人死亡时，揭晓预测结果。如果该人物以预测的方式死亡，他们就完成了自己的命运，并立即被众神复活作为奖励。如果他们的死亡方式与预言一致或在一个等级之内，他们就会带着对某个重要人物的命运的一些有用的洞察力回到人世。",

	"{@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 5d8 + 5}) radiant damage, and the target is \"one step closer to death.\" If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it's treated as if it's already failed one death saving throw. This effect is cumulative; each inexorable threads hit adds one unsuccessful death saving throw. If a character who's been hit three or more times by inexorable threads is reduced to 0 hit points, he or she dies immediately. This effect lasts until the character completes a long rest.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 9}击中，到达30英尺，一个目标。{@h}27 ({@damage 5d8 + 5})辐射伤害，并且目标 \"离死亡更近一步\"。如果目标被降低到0命中率，它将被视为已经失败了一次死亡拯救。这个效果是累积性的；每一次不可抗拒的线程命中都会增加一次不成功的死亡挽救动作。如果一个角色被不可抗拒的丝线击中三次或更多次，他或她的命中率降至0，他或她会立即死亡。这个效果会一直持续到该角色完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"One target within 60 feet of the skein witch must make a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target's fate is bound to one random ally of the target.
