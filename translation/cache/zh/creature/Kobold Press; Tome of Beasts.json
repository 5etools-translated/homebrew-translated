Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.": "这些热血动物像猫一样挑逗着它们的受害者，将世界和其中的一切视为它们的合法猎物。年轻的火焰龙比它们的长辈更不含糊。火焰龙可能会强迫一个女人看着她的家人死去，或者毁掉一张漂亮的脸蛋来取乐--直接而邪恶。随着龙的成熟，这种天生的虐待狂发展为对更复杂的运动的渴望。衰老的火龙利用政治、谋杀和魔法进行精心策划，只有他们这类人能够欣赏。许多人创造的阴谋是如此复杂和有层次，以至于他们缺乏真正的解决方案，只创造了无尽的操纵。一个英雄可能会挫败一次暗杀，但却看到因此被拯救的国王成为一个暴君。她可能打败了在统治者耳边吹牛的大臣，却发现他是一个巨大阴谋中的棋子。黑暗的野心、有毒的匕首和旧日的仇怨形成了这样的势头，每当另一个计划结束时，就会有一个计划开始。通常情况下，即使杀死龙族的主谋也无法扑灭其引发的大火。",
	"The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon's land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.": "这些计划的结果是次要的，他们从追求一个模糊的、不断变化的目标中获得了乐趣。有些人花了几个世纪的时间来折磨一个家族，而这只不过是侵入了龙的土地。另一些人在将拙劣的言语扭曲成最可怕的侮辱之后，策划了永恒的诅咒。复仇本身并不重要，重要的是有一个仇恨、阴谋和毁灭的借口。火焰龙喜欢这样的复仇机会，把每一次都看作是一种令人愉快的爱好。游戏的中断点燃了真正可怕的怒火，在这些罕见的失败时刻，他们的愤怒可能是灾难性的。整个城市被烧毁。",
	"Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.": "火焰龙和其他真正的龙一样，都是物质主义者和领土主义者。每条龙都在疯狂地追求自己的执念，以填补自己的囤积物。有些人腐蚀无辜，有些人把国家推向战争，但他们总是为每一次胜利收集纪念品，无论是小事还是大事。一个人可能会收集烧焦的头骨，而另一个人则保存着被推翻的帝国的融化的财物。当不在外面挑拨离间的时候，古老的火焰龙喜欢沉思他们的囤积物。每件东西都会让他们想起自己的威严和天才。",
	"Nothing is safe from a flame dragon's endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon's undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon's death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.": "在火焰龙无休止的阴谋诡计和自恋面前，没有什么是安全的。他们渴望得到绝对的关注和持续的保证。任何羞辱火焰龙的人都会更明智地杀死它。它的生存确保了火焰龙几代人都能得到无微不至的关注。更明智的做法是，确保火焰龙的死亡没有一丝牵连。所有燃烧的巨蛇都把谋杀它们的一个亲属视为最严重的侮辱。",
	"Flame dragons descend from the passionate daughter of the great World Serpent.

She manufactures an outrage when bored, working wildly complex plots against arbitrary enemies until it all ends in death.

Her false affections culminate in a fiery death for the unfortunate object of her attentions. She always leaves some cherished possession untouched by the cremation and builds her hoards with the memories of a thousand murdered champions.": "Glaurvistus，吸烟的祸害，插入许多凡人的事件中，在历史上留下她的印记。她在无聊时制造愤怒，对任意的敌人实施疯狂的复杂阴谋，直到一切以死亡结束。她最喜欢的游戏是承诺崇拜一个坚强的英雄，并给这个人周围的任何力量带来缓慢但具有破坏性的毁灭。她虚假的感情最终会让她关注的不幸对象火速死亡。她总是在火化时留下一些珍贵的财产，并以一千名被谋杀的冠军的记忆来建立她的囤积物。",
	"Glaurvistus has many lairs, most within active volcanoes or deep below the ground. Each boasts unique treasures to lure would-be heroes. She grants many fortresses to her most beloved offspring, who oversee their mother's domain. There is no surer way for a hero to gain her attention than by slaying one of her favored children. Legends claim she lairs in a true sanctuary, accessing the outside world only through magic or caves of molten adamantine.": "格洛维斯特斯有许多巢穴，大多数位于活火山内或地底深处。每个巢穴都拥有独特的宝藏，以引诱未来的英雄们。她将许多堡垒授予她最心爱的后代，由他们监督母亲的领域。对英雄来说，没有比杀死她最宠爱的孩子之一更容易引起她的注意的方法了。传说中，她躲在一个真正的避难所里，只有通过魔法或熔化的金刚砂洞穴才能进入外部世界。",
	"The Smoking Scourge recognizes few rivals. She views most dragons as children and offers grudging esteem only to the oldest and most powerful. She greets her immediate siblings with familial respect but considers them all beneath her. From her spawn she demands obedience, and her regard is only earned with constant success. She expects immediate discarding of centuries-long plots at her merest whim, and the price for disloyalty is a terrible vengeance.": "吸烟的祸害几乎不认得对手。她视大多数龙为孩子，只对最年长和最强大的龙给予勉强的尊重。她对她的直系兄弟姐妹表示尊重，但认为他们都在她之下。她要求她的孩子们服从，只有不断的成功才能赢得她的尊重。她期待着在她最短的时间内立即抛弃长达几个世纪的阴谋，而不忠的代价就是可怕的报复。",
	"The oldest of her children see patterns over centuries, and they wonder whether Glaurvistus pursues some greater goal they cannot fathom. All creation is her plaything.": "她最年长的孩子们看到了几个世纪以来的模式，他们想知道格洛维斯特是否在追求一些他们无法理解的更大目标。所有的创造都是她的玩物。",

It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.": "虚空龙是知识渊博的生物，但它们已经看到了太多，在虚空本身的边缘徘徊。凝视着外面打着哈欠的虚无，已经付出了代价。虚空龙带着那虚无的一部分，它慢慢地吞噬了它们的存在。他们都是不正常的，他们的疯狂是可以传染的。当虚空龙陷入愤怒并大发雷霆的时候，它就会从它们身上流淌出来，打破较小生命的思想。",
	"Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures.

	"Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.": "风龙将任何被空气触及的地方都视为自己的财产，而凡人则将其视为傲慢的缩影。他们的自恋不是没有原因的，因为令人敬畏的力量支持他们对合法控制权的主张。对变幻莫测的大风之龙来说，力量是最终的仲裁者。虽然风龙小龙是新生龙中最弱的，但它们的力量增长很快，很少有完全长大的龙被视为更强。",
	"Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it's unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.": "风龙是凡间生物中最大的欺凌者和最坏的暴君之一。这些有时很愚蠢的生物对任何感知到的挑战都会采取人身攻击，并对羞辱对手感到非常高兴。他们声称拥有大片的领土，但对其管理却不屑一顾，他们把领土上的凡人视为财产。臣子们只得到可疑的保护，以换取坚定不移的忠诚。风龙可能会因为追随者被杀而寻求血腥的报复，但它不可能不顾一切地首先阻止生命的丧失。",
	"Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.": "有些人认为，风之龙的要求远远超过了他们所能控制或巡逻的范围。因为他们非常喜欢高空，所以他们更喜欢在现有的最高点进行统治并与地上的祈求者会面：大山的山顶或由可怕的奴隶建立的高耸的纪念碑上。但这些龙也被游荡的欲望所驱使，经常远离他们的王位。他们最终总会回来，准备征服新的一代，并将暴虐的爪子按在任何质疑其统治权的人的脖子上。",
	"These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death.

	"Wind dragons much prefer to fight from the air, and can be effective with spells and breath weapons there. However, this can be quite frustrating for parties without ranged attacks, and even then, ancient dragons are immune to non-magical ranged attacks and adult wind dragons impose disadvantage.

Wind dragons are designed to soften up foes at range, and then swoop in for the kill in melee, carrying off one or more victims.": "风龙更喜欢从空中作战，在那里可以有效地使用法术和呼吸武器。然而，对于没有远程攻击的一方来说，这可能是相当令人沮丧的，即使如此，古龙对非魔法的远程攻击是免疫的，而成年风龙则会施加不利因素。同样重要的是，风龙自身的传奇行动和它的多重攻击都需要更接近和处于近战。风龙被设计成在范围内软化敌人，然后在近战中俯冲杀敌，带走一个或多个受害者。",
	"Wind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can't pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.": "风龙把它们的巢穴建在可以俯瞰和支配它们声称是自己的土地的地方，但又足够偏远，这样居民就不能用保护或正义的请求来纠缠它们。它们几乎不惧怕外界环境，所以在暴露的山面高处的浅洞是最理想的。风龙喜欢点缀着岩石尖顶和高大陡峭的悬崖的高处，在那里，风龙可以栖息在呼啸的风中，捕捉掠过峡谷和撕裂峭壁的交错的上升和下降气流。非飞行的生物发现这些地方不那么好客。",

	"As the eons passed, Arbeyach's interests and ambitions deviated further from those of the Hellish lords around him. He grows ever more unyielding, ever more alien. Eventually, those below and those above him expelled the Prince of Swarms from power; none can say whether Arbeyach allowed himself to be deposed.

Due to its size, the beast must find deep ponds or lakes to hide in, but it can flatten itself comfortably to rest in two feet of water. It leads with its wicked horns before grabbing hold of its target or another nearby foe and hanging on as it claws its victim to death. The creature relishes the feel of its victim's struggles to escape its embrace and reserves its roar, which sounds like a cross between a toad's croak and lion's roar emanating from a creature the size of a dragon, for organized foes or against overwhelming numbers.

Villages ten miles away from the lair often hear these howls for a week and pray that the creatures don't attack. Once mating has been completed (and groves of trees have been destroyed), the female finds a secluded, shallow lake in which to bury eggs.
