	"When a number of sharks gather around a bleeding victim, the scent of the blood and the thrill of the kill send all sharks into a feeding frenzy. Nothing escapes from such an attack, not even some sharks. Sharks eat anything living, even each other, during a feeding frenzy. Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat very quickly, up to four large-sized sharks can attack a man-sized opponent in the water every round.": "当一些鲨鱼聚集在一个流血的受害者周围时，血的气味和杀戮的快感使所有的鲨鱼都陷入捕食的狂潮。没有什么能从这样的攻击中逃脱，甚至一些鲨鱼也不能。鲨鱼在捕食狂潮中吃任何活物，甚至是相互之间。由于鲨鱼移动起来，咬一口肉，然后迅速撤退，所以每一轮最多可以有四条大鲨鱼在水中攻击一个人大小的对手。",
	"Sharks are pure eating and killing machines, evolving quite naturally into superior predators, and then remaining unchanged for millions of years. They are primarily scavengers, preying on the sick and wounded, but attack fresh meat if tempted to do so. They are very territorial and solitary.": "鲨鱼是纯粹的进食和杀戮机器，很自然地进化成高级掠食者，然后在数百万年里保持不变。它们主要是清道夫，捕食病人和伤员，但如果受到诱惑，也会攻击鲜肉。它们具有很强的领地性和独居性。",
	"The only friends the sharks have are the sahuagin, who appreciate the predators for their bloody, ruthless, and efficient natures. They often use sharks as guardians, mounts, sacrifices, and personal pets. The king of all sahuagin is rumored to possess a megalodon shark of largest size, which he apparently feeds quite often. Sahuagin priestesses offer all of their sacrifices to pure white great white sharks of largest size, that are often decorated in collars of gold and silver.": "鲨鱼唯一的朋友是萨瓦金人，他们欣赏捕食者的血腥、无情和高效的天性。他们经常使用鲨鱼作为守护者、坐骑、祭品和私人宠物。据传，所有萨瓦金人的国王拥有一条最大尺寸的巨齿鲨，他显然经常喂食这条鲨鱼。萨瓦金女祭司把所有的祭品都献给了最大尺寸的纯白大白鲨，这些鲨鱼通常被装饰在金银项圈里。",
	"Sahuagin are the only known race to have successfully trained sharks as mounts and the process is secret. What is known is that a shark and its rider can both attack the same enemy with startling agility, making the combination one of the most fearsome in the deeps. The harness used to mount a sahuagin warrior on the back of a shark is apparently made of a special kind of seaweed, unknown to those of the surface world.": "萨瓦金人是唯一已知的成功训练鲨鱼作为坐骑的种族，其过程是秘密的。众所周知的是，鲨鱼和它的骑手都能以惊人的敏捷性攻击同一个敌人，使这种组合成为深海中最可怕的东西之一。用来将萨瓦金战士骑在鲨鱼背上的马具显然是由一种特殊的海藻制成的，这一点不为地面世界的人所知。",
	"Sharks have only two natural weaknesses. The first one is that their internal organs are only poorly protected by a thick, flexible layer of gristle instead of a hard skeleton. Some creatures, such as dolphins, take advantage of this by ramming sharks from the side. Because of their highly intelligent nature, dolphins are the only true enemies of sharks. They are the only known species that actively hunts down and kills these otherwise greatly feared and respected monsters.": "鲨鱼只有两个天然的弱点。第一个是它们的内部器官只有厚厚的、有弹性的肉质层，而不是坚硬的骨架，保护得很差。一些生物，如海豚，利用这一点，从侧面冲撞鲨鱼。由于海豚的高智商，它们是鲨鱼的唯一真正的敌人。它们是唯一已知的物种，主动猎杀这些本来非常令人恐惧和尊敬的怪物。",
	"Sharks are also forced to continuously move through the water in order to force sufficient volumes of oxygen-rich water past their primitive gills. Therefore, a shark that is held immobile for {@dice 1d4+1} hours will die of suffocation.": "鲨鱼也被迫在水中不断移动，以迫使足够数量的富氧水通过它们原始的鳃。因此，一条鲨鱼如果被关押了{@dice 1d4+1}小时不动，就会死于窒息。",

Young savants born elsewhere leave their broods virtually as soon as they are capable of independence, believing themselves to be guided by the Blood Queen to the great cities of the aboleth deep in the Underdark.

	"The second, more dubious theory, is that slithering trackers were created, not born. Their high intelligence seems to lead many knowledgeable sages to believe that the creation of a slithering tracker is a hideous process, involving the transformation of a living human being. Certain legends seem to support this assertion, as there are many accounts of dark wizards removing the bones of their enemies, turning them into hulking masses of jelly-like flesh. While it is certain that no respectable wizard (good or neutrally aligned) would resort to creating such horrors, it is just as certain that there are many practitioners of the darker arts who have performed much worse experiments.": "第二种更令人怀疑的理论是，滑行追踪者是被创造出来的，而不是天生的。他们的高智商似乎使许多有见识的圣人相信，创造一个滑行追踪者是一个可怕的过程，涉及到对一个活人的改造。某些传说似乎支持这一论断，因为有许多关于黑暗巫师去除敌人的骨头，把他们变成巨大的果冻状肉块的叙述。虽然可以肯定的是，没有一个受人尊敬的巫师（善良的或中立的）会诉诸于创造这样的恐怖，但同样可以肯定的是，有许多黑暗艺术的从业者进行过更糟糕的实验。",
