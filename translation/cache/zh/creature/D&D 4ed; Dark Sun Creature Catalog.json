	"Aarakocras are hunters and scavengers that eat just about any meat they find. They loot whatever they can from victims claimed by the wastes. Most residents of Athas try to avoid aarakocras, considering them to be sordid opportunists, but the vulture-folk have few sworn enemies. The aarakocras keep to the skies, and their homes are built high on cliffs or mesa tops. From there, scouts search the nearby desert for food and intruders. Their sharp eyes miss little in the barren wilds, and a tribe brooks no intrusion on its territory without receiving tribute in compensation. Lost travelers who pay the requested amount might receive guidance to a landmark or a safer part of the wilderness. If rebuffed, the aarakocras won't hesitate to kidnap members of a trespassing party and hold them for ransom. To avoid harassment, merchant houses sometimes make deals with powerful aarakocra tribes; weaker tribes, reluctant to draw the ire of their stronger kin, leave those merchants alone. Despite their reputation as distasteful scavengers, aarakocras are deeply spiritual. They revere the sky and the sun as primal entities. Those members of a tribe that wield primal power use spirits and elementals to aid their kin in mundane tasks as well as in battle. Aarakocras are rarely found in the company of other humanoids, although they sometimes work with kenku tribes. They also follow raiders or dangerous monsters from the air, picking off survivors of the predators' attacks. Aarakocras train flying beasts as pets, and they use rituals to bring air elementals and spirits into the world. Slavers steal aarakocra young and eggs, selling the creatures to nobles and merchant houses as slaves. These nobles and merchants, in turn, put the vulture folk to work as soldiers and scouts.": "Aarakocras是猎人和拾荒者，几乎吃任何他们找到的肉。他们从荒原上的受害者身上掠夺任何他们能得到的东西。Athas的大多数居民都尽量避免Aarakocras，认为他们是肮脏的机会主义者，但秃鹫民族很少有死敌。aarakocras一直在天空中，他们的家都建在悬崖或山顶的高处。在那里，侦察员在附近的沙漠中搜寻食物和入侵者。他们锐利的目光在荒芜的荒野中几乎没有错过，一个部落在没有收到贡品作为补偿的情况下，不会容忍对其领土的入侵。付出所需费用的迷路者可能会得到指引，前往一个地标或荒野中更安全的地方。如果遭到拒绝，阿拉库拉人会毫不犹豫地绑架闯入者的成员并勒索赎金。为了避免骚扰，商行有时会与强大的阿拉科拉部落进行交易；较弱的部落不愿意招致其强大亲属的愤怒，会放过这些商人。尽管他们被誉为令人讨厌的清道夫，但阿拉科拉人有很深的灵性。他们崇尚天空和太阳，视其为最原始的实体。那些拥有原始力量的部落成员利用精神和元素来帮助他们的亲属完成世俗的任务和战斗。Aarakocras很少与其他人类为伍，尽管他们有时与Kenku部落合作。他们还从空中跟踪突袭者或危险的怪物，在掠夺者的攻击中挑选幸存者。Aarakocras把飞行兽当作宠物来训练，他们用仪式把空气元素和精神带入世界。奴隶主偷取阿拉科克拉的幼崽和蛋，将这些生物作为奴隶卖给贵族和商行。这些贵族和商人反过来又把秃鹰人当作士兵和侦察兵来使用。",

	"who curse the blazing sun overhead might breathe a sigh of relief when the crimson orb sets, but their solace proves short lived as the shapes sliding beneath the dunes reveal themselves. When the sun dies away, the primitive, simple-minded anakores burst from the sands, eager to seize the prey they have stealthily tracked during the daylight hours.": "当深红色的球体落下时，那些诅咒头顶上的烈日的人可能会松一口气，但他们的安慰被证明是短暂的，因为沙丘下滑动的形状暴露了自己。当太阳消失时，原始的、头脑简单的Anakores从沙地上冲了出来，渴望抓住他们在白天隐秘地追踪的猎物。",
	"Anakores live beneath loose dunes of dust or sand. They can sense vibrations of prey passing on the surface, and some anakores can smell blood spilled on the earth above. Only ravenous anakores attack prey during the day. Instead, they lurk beneath the sands and track promising game until sunset.": "Anakores生活在松散的尘埃或沙丘下面。它们能感觉到猎物在地面上经过时的振动，有些Anakores能闻到洒在地面上的血迹。只有贪婪的Anakores会在白天攻击猎物。相反，它们潜伏在沙子下面，追踪有希望的猎物，直到日落。",
	"These nomadic creatures follow prey from place to place, seldom lairing in one location for long. They travel and hunt in small packs, and the most successful stalker among them is their leader. Anakores usually bring down as many kills as they can before retreating to feast. Each member of the pack has a role in the attack. Dune kings burst from the sand with great force, leading the attack and unsettling the terrain to provide the anakores with an advantage. Renders tear into the quarry savagely, weakening them before the kill. Hunters separate individual victims from the group, dragging them below the sand one by one.": "这些游牧生物跟随猎物从一个地方到另一个地方，很少在一个地方停留很长时间。它们成群结队地旅行和狩猎，其中最成功的跟踪者是它们的领袖。阿纳科里人通常在撤退前尽可能多地击倒一些猎物，然后再去大吃一顿。群体中的每个成员在攻击中都有一个角色。沙丘之王以巨大的力量从沙地上迸发出来，领导进攻，使地形动荡不安，为阿纳科尔人提供优势。撕裂者野蛮地撕咬猎物，在杀戮前削弱他们的力量。猎手们将个别受害者从群体中分离出来，将他们一个个拖到沙地下面。",
	"While on the move, anakores subsist on roots, including poisonous specimens that aid in the production of the anakore paralytic. A telltale sign of recent anakore movement is an area filled with fallen, rootless plants. Occasionally, a particularly cunning dune king disposes of the foliage so as not to give away the pack's presence but this level of craftiness is rare. Little is known about the origins of the anakores. According to an ancient tale, terrors from beyond the sky touched the humanoids that were forebears of the creatures. Afterward, these ancestors recoiled from the burning sun and burrowed below the wastes to find cool, embracing darkness. Beneath the sands, the creatures dreamed dark reveries and became nightmares of the desert. No discernible characteristics distinguish anakores as male or female. It is whispered that the creatures produce no young, instead dragging selected victims to weird hollows under the sands. Inside these wombs, the captives become new anakores rather than meals. How and why the anakores choose particular individuals as their new kin is unknown.": "在移动过程中，阿纳科人以根为生，包括帮助生产阿纳科麻痹剂的有毒标本。最近Anakore移动的一个明显标志是一个充满了倒下的无根植物的区域。偶尔，一个特别狡猾的沙丘之王会把这些叶子处理掉，以免泄露族群的存在，但这种程度的狡猾是罕见的。关于Anakores的起源，人们知之甚少。根据一个古老的传说，来自天外的恐怖触动了作为这些生物祖先的人形动物。之后，这些祖先从灼热的太阳中退缩，钻入荒野之下，寻找凉爽、包容的黑暗。在沙子下面，这些生物做着黑暗的梦，成为沙漠的噩梦。没有明显的特征来区分Anakores是男是女。据传，这些生物不生孩子，而是把选定的受害者拖到沙子下面的奇怪空地上。在这些子宫里，被俘虏的人成为新的Anakores而不是食物。Anakores如何以及为什么选择特定的人作为他们的新亲属，尚不清楚。",
	"Anakores avoid battle on terrain in which they cannot burrow. They appear with others of their kind or with other burrowing creatures such as bulettes, hejkins, galeb duhrs and kruthiks. Wasteland raiders convince groups of anakores to work for them by paying the creatures with food and shiny baubles. Dreams and visions also entice anakores to explore ancient ruins where other aberrant creatures dwell, some of which are stronger and cleverer than even the dune kings. In such places, anakores serve these creatures and join in their incomprehensible rites. Anakores burrow under prey before rising to attack. Hunters emerge, grab targets, and use drag under to reduce the number of enemies they must face. Renders burst from the sands, stay among the prey topside, and lay targets low to make them more vulnerable to allied attacks. A dune king launches into battle with sand eruption and uses its toxic claws to prevent the quarry from escaping. When caught in poor tactical situations, anakores flee or deal peacefully (but grudgingly) with enemies.": "Anakores避免在它们无法钻入的地形上作战。它们与其他同类或其他穴居生物一起出现，如bulettes、hejkins、galeb duhrs和kruthiks。荒原突袭者通过向这些生物支付食物和闪亮的饰物来说服一群Anakores为他们工作。梦境和幻觉也诱使阿纳科里人去探索其他反常生物居住的古代遗迹，其中一些甚至比沙丘之王更强大和更聪明。在这些地方，Anakores为这些生物服务，并加入他们难以理解的仪式。Anakores在上升到攻击之前，先在猎物下面钻洞。猎人出现，抓住目标，并使用拖拽来减少他们必须面对的敌人的数量。撕裂者从沙地上冲出来，留在猎物的上方，将目标压低，使其更容易受到联盟的攻击。沙丘之王以沙子喷发的方式投入战斗，用它的毒爪来阻止猎物逃跑。当陷入糟糕的战术局面时，沙丘王会逃跑或与敌人和平相处（但很勉强）。",

	"Over the centuries, life-warping magic in the remote wilderness has spawned many perverse creatures, including braxats. They arose from four-legged reptilian beasts similar to mekillots, gaining sentience and a malicious nature under a grim magical influence. A braxat is a hulking, bipedal, lizardlike humanoid that towers over many giants at its full adult height of 15 feet. Its features are a combination of those of a rhinoceros and a spiny beetle. The top of its head and its back are lined with thick, horncovered plates, and a single, massive horn juts up from between its nostrils. Creatures smaller and weaker than a braxat can expect contempt from it at best and death at worst. Anything as big and powerful as a braxat - including other braxats - is a target of its hate and competitiveness. When facing stronger foes, braxats sometimes overlook their rivalries to band together. They particularly detest giants and ally to raid giants' tribes. Braxats also come together in mated pairs or in service to more powerful overlords. They mate only when food is plentiful and shelter, such as a cavern or a buried ruin, is available for the eggs and hatchlings. Even so, one braxat that has a desire to mate must subjugate another to this purpose. Similarly, anyone who wishes to employ a braxat must first prove stronger than the creature or help it gain more food and wealth than it could amass on its own. Adult braxats fight to the death rather than submit to an untested foe.": "几个世纪以来，偏远荒野中的生命扭曲魔法催生了许多反常的生物，包括Braxats。他们产生于类似于Mekillots的四脚爬行动物，在严峻的魔法影响下获得了知觉和恶意的本质。布拉克萨特是一个巨大的、双足的、类似蜥蜴的人形生物，成年后的身高达到15英尺，比许多巨人还高。它的特征是犀牛和带刺甲虫的结合。它的头顶和背部都有厚厚的、覆盖着角的板块，一只巨大的角从它的鼻孔之间伸出来。比貔貅更小、更弱的生物，最好的情况是被它蔑视，最坏的情况是被它杀死。任何像牙签一样大和强大的东西--包括其他牙签--都是它仇恨和竞争的目标。当面对更强大的敌人时，Braxats有时会忽略他们的竞争而联合起来。他们特别厌恶巨人，并结盟突袭巨人的部落。貔貅也会以交配的方式走到一起，或为更强大的霸主服务。它们只有在食物充足，且有洞穴或被掩埋的废墟等庇护所可供产卵和孵化的情况下才交配。即便如此，一个有交配欲望的Braxat必须为此目的而征服另一个。同样，任何想雇佣貔貅的人都必须首先证明自己比貔貅更强壮，或者帮助它获得比它自己能积累的更多食物和财富。成年貔貅会拼死抵抗，而不是屈服于一个未经考验的敌人。",
	"Few creatures have enough power to earn the respect of an adult braxat. Strong leaders who promise success in hunting and pillaging might win over a braxat by appealing to its mercenary streak. Sometimes a braxat agrees to serve as muscle for a potent evil being. Only the foulest humanoids can tolerate a braxat's cruelty and violence. Braxats respect neither law nor authority, and they fear no one. Their awesome strength, psionic abilities, and damage reduction make them nearly unstoppable, and it is not uncommon for a single band of them to wipe out several humanoid settlements in the course of a year. Occasionally a few survivors from braxat raids band together and try to hunt the creatures down, but rarely do they succeed in exacting vengeance. Experienced adventurers have been known to hunt braxats for sport, pitting their experience and cleverness against the creatures' raw cunning and psionic abilities. As such hunters have discovered to their dismay, braxats are quite proficient at protecting themselves with deadly traps and ambushes. Most such hunts end in victory for the braxats, but now and then one is successful, yielding a few braxat-horn trophies to the hunters. These horns have no value in themselves, but artists sometimes carve intricate sculptures on them and sell them as art objects.": "很少有生物有足够的力量来赢得成年布拉萨的尊重。承诺在狩猎和掠夺中获得成功的强大领导者可能会通过吸引貔貅的雇佣精神而赢得貔貅的青睐。有时，貔貅会同意为一个强大的邪恶生物充当肌肉。只有最肮脏的人类才能容忍布拉萨的残忍和暴力。布拉萨特既不尊重法律，也不尊重权威，他们不惧怕任何人。他们令人敬畏的力量、幻觉能力和伤害减免使他们几乎不可阻挡，在一年的时间里，他们中的一队人马消灭几个人形定居点是很常见的。偶尔会有一些布拉萨特袭击的幸存者联合起来，试图猎杀这些生物，但他们很少能成功地进行报复。经验丰富的冒险家们已经知道将猎杀Braxats作为一项运动，用他们的经验和聪明才智来对抗这种生物的原始狡猾和幻觉能力。正如这些猎人所发现的那样，布拉萨特非常善于用致命的陷阱和伏击来保护自己。大多数这样的狩猎都是以貔貅的胜利而告终，但偶尔也会有一次成功，给猎人带来一些貔貅角的战利品。这些角本身没有价值，但艺术家有时会在上面雕刻复杂的雕塑，并作为艺术品出售。",
	"An enterprising or lucky braxat might become the chieftain of a raiding tribe of savage and callous humanoids. Such a band boldly claims a wide swath of territory and turns the choicest morsels and treasures over to its brutal chief. Braxats have no loyalty, however, and if food grows scarce, they will turn on weaker allies, other braxats, and even members of their own families. Braxats live in a tribal society in which males and females have equal social status and access to leadership positions. Each tribal leader must prove his or her worthiness annually in a ritual combat with a single challenger who has earned the right of contest through successful raiding over the past year. Young braxats are trained to fight from the time they can stand. Deadly combat between young braxats over potential mates, lairs, or treasure is encouraged to ensure that only the strongest and cleverest survive to reproduce.": "一个有进取心的或幸运的Braxat可能会成为一个由野蛮和冷酷的人类组成的袭击部落的首领。这样的部落大胆地宣称拥有广阔的领土，并将最美味的食物和财物交给其残暴的首领。然而，Braxats没有忠诚度，如果食物越来越少，他们会转向较弱的盟友、其他Braxats，甚至是他们自己的家庭成员。布拉哈特人生活在一个部落社会中，男性和女性拥有平等的社会地位和获得领导职位的机会。每个部落领袖必须在每年的仪式上与一个挑战者进行战斗，以证明他或她的价值，这个挑战者在过去一年里通过成功的突袭赢得了竞争的权利。年轻的Braxats从他们能够站立的时候就开始训练战斗。为了确保只有最强壮和最聪明的人能够存活下来繁衍后代，年轻的Braxats之间为争夺潜在的配偶、巢穴或财宝而进行的致命战斗受到鼓励。",

	"These territorial predators came into existence through defiling magic. Dune reapers consume everything they find: They devour humanoids and beasts, graze on plants, and even chew through wagons and buildings. They sometimes eat stones to aid digestion of tougher materials. Reapers that go too long without food resort to cannibalism. Familial groups called prides break into packs to hunt the wastes. A pride makes its home near a water source, forming a hive that becomes the center of the pride's territory. Hives are mounds of sand, earth, and rock sealed together with secretions from the drones. Within the mounds are tunnels and chambers, which might be connected to existing underground spaces or structures, especially those containing sources of water. Humanoids can exist close to a hive only if the reapers have another plentiful source of food.": "这些领地掠夺者是通过玷污魔法而存在的。沙丘收割者吞噬它们发现的一切。它们吞噬人类和野兽，吃植物，甚至咀嚼马车和建筑物。它们有时会吃石头来帮助消化更坚硬的材料。长时间没有食物的死神会采用食人的方式。被称为 \"骄傲 \"的家族式群体会分成几群，在荒原上捕猎。一个王族在水源附近安家，形成一个蜂巢，成为王族领土的中心。蜂巢是由沙子、泥土和岩石组成的土堆，用无人机的分泌物密封起来。巢穴内有隧道和密室，可能与现有的地下空间或结构相连，特别是那些含有水源的地方。只有当收割者有另一个丰富的食物来源时，人类才能在靠近蜂巢的地方生存。",
	"Dune reaper warriors are always female and rule over the smaller drones and shrieks, all of which are male. Each warrior forms a hunting pack with multiple drones and shrieks as mates; the other reapers can become erratic if she is slain. A warrior's mates closely match her in power, ensuring that only the strongest reapers reproduce. The dominant female in the pride, known as the matron, makes all decisions, guides the pride to new territory, and directs followers in creating the hive. A matron can be unseated only by another female that defeats her in a duel to the death.": "沙丘收割者战士总是雌性的，统治着较小的无人机和嘶吼者，这些人都是雄性。每个战士与多个无人机和嘶吼者组成一个狩猎群，作为伴侣；如果她被杀，其他收割者会变得不稳定。一个战士的配偶在力量上与她密切相关，以确保只有最强壮的收割者才会繁殖。蜂群中占主导地位的雌性，被称为母皇，做出所有决定，引导蜂群进入新的领域，并指导追随者创建蜂巢。只有在生死决斗中打败她的另一只雌性，才能解除母皇的地位。",
	"Dune reapers are extremely dangerous during their annual mating season, when they hunt for prey to feed growing young. The pack's matron lays eggs in the bodies of living creatures. When the eggs hatch, the young reapers devour the helpless captives. The stronger hatchlings then set upon their brood mates, killing and eating the weak ones. Young reapers that survive are driven from the hive after about two months and must either join another pride or form a new one. These juveniles are as deadly as adults.": "沙丘收割者在每年的交配季节是非常危险的，他们会猎取猎物来喂养成长中的孩子。群体的母体将卵产在生物的体内。当蛋孵化时，年轻的收割者会吞噬无助的俘虏。更强壮的幼崽会向它们的兄弟姐妹下手，杀死并吃掉弱小者。活下来的年轻收割者在大约两个月后被赶出蜂巢，必须加入另一个蜂群或组建一个新的蜂群。这些幼虫和成年虫一样致命。",

Its head is triangular, and the neck attaches near the top of the head, causing its leering, toothy face and pointed chin to hang below its shoulders. The dune stalker's gangly body is hairless, and its red, dusty, abrasive skin has no pores. The combination of short legs, long arms, and stooped posture causes its hands to drag on the ground. Its fingers and toes (four on each limb) are long and bony. The creature has massive shoulders and an enormous chest, which tapers to a narrow waist and hips. A dune stalker that has been assigned a mission by its summoner pursues the literal fulfillment of its instructions to the exclusion of all else. It resents its time on the Material Plane and wants to make its stay there as short as possible. Occasionally, a summoner's instructions are phrased in such a way that the dune stalker cannot actually carry them out.

	"A dune stalker's preferred tactic is to hide in a rocky area and attack from ambush. When possible, it tries to gain higher ground on its opponents by climbing up on a rock or a structure to conceal itself. It often begins an assault by using its shout ability to disorient a group of opponents, then leaping into combat to deliver its kiss of death. Against foes within its reach, a dune stalker usually prefers to deliver a kiss of death against just one target rather than a shout against the whole group. The preferred target is the one it seeks to slay, or the one that presents the greatest danger, or the one that appears to have the strongest good alignment.

	"A weird can divine information that could change the very course of history. It has its finger on the pulse of fate and knows exactly where possible courses of action might lead. Like most seers, an elemental weird never provides a clear, concise prophecy.

	"All weirds, regardless of their elemental subtypes, are connected to each other in fundamental ways. They share a unique, secret bond that is evidenced in their level of cooperation. A weird that cannot provide the desired knowledge to a supplicant usually guides him or her to another weird for better counsel. Weirds of different elements often place their pools close to one another to broaden the range of divination services available to supplicants in an area.

	"Elemental Pool": "元素池",
	"Each weird dwells within a large pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird must provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Air Pool. An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).": "每个怪人都住在一个大池子里（至少20英尺宽，40英尺深），里面充满了最纯粹的元素。池子总是被固定在一个平面上（地板、墙壁或天花板；可能的方向见个别条目），这样它的深度在该表面上形成一个空洞。该表面必须有足够的深度来容纳水池。一个元素池也可以作为同一元素的更大体积内的一个独立区域存在；例如，一个水怪的池子可能位于海洋或湖泊的底部。池子的底部有一个通往该怪人的本位面的入口。被怪人准许进入池子的生物必须提供自己的保护，使其不受元素物质的影响，并提供在该环境中呼吸和移动的方法。否则，他们就会受到个别条目中给出的影响。一个怪人在身体上被束缚在它的池子里，除了通过传送门回到它的本位面外，不能离开。怪人可以上升到离水池表面10英尺的高度，但其身体的下半部分必须始终与元素物质保持接触。一旦怪人离开池子回到它的本位面，传送门就会关闭，池子就会失去它的特殊效果。空气池。一个空气怪兽的池子里充满了波涛汹涌的、可呼吸的空气和雾气的蒸汽。没有飞行能力的生物无法在其中移动，除非是坠落。空气怪人的池子可以贴在任何垂直或水平的表面上，它可以朝上或朝下（例如，如果贴在天花板上）。火池。这个池子里有一股跳舞的火焰，不断地燃烧和冒烟。在火池中没有保护的易燃物会立即着火，在火池中的任何生物每回合都会受到3d10的火焰伤害。没有飞行能力的生物不能在这个池子里移动，除非是坠落。一个火怪的池子可以贴在任何垂直或水平的表面上，而且它只能以右面朝上的姿势出现（比如在洞穴的地板上）。土池。这个池子里充满了搅动的泥浆、岩石和土。每个在其中的生物（除了土怪和土元素）每回合都会从不断碾压的泥土中受到4d8的打击伤害。此外，进入池子的生物如果没有办法呼吸就会窒息，如果不能钻洞就会被禁锢（限制）。土怪的池子只能贴在水平面上，而且只能出现在右侧的位置（例如在洞穴的地板上）。水池。这个水池充满了冒泡的、旋转的水。任何在其中不能呼吸水的生物都会立即开始淹死。任何没有游泳能力的生物都无法在水潭中移动，除非是掉下去。一个水怪的池子只能贴在一个水平的表面上，而且它只能出现在一个右侧的位置上（比如在洞穴的地板上）。",

	"A grisgol is a horrifying construct composed of broken and worn-out magic items, animated by a powerful spellcaster who has harnessed the spirit of a lich. Its skeleton is fabricated from old staffs and wands and its skin from expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummy's burial cloth. Woven into this are rings, bracers, fragments of leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils, vaguely resembling sets of internal organs. It typically wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light glare from underneath a hood or old helmet. Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk, is the original lich's phylactery. Unless one knows what animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the insides of the construct. From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can hear the tinkling of glass touching glass, the sloshing of half-filled vials and bottles, the squeaking of leather, the rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most prominently, the shuffl ing of paper as if pages of a tome were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily residue upon whatever it touches. A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich that powers it.

	"Some halflings roam the desert, although they are a rare sight in the Seven Cities.

Individual halflings indulge their wanderlust by exploring unfamiliar areas of the world. On occasion, bloodthirsty renegade tribes aggressively raid villages or waylay caravans in the vast wastes.": "一些半身人在沙漠中游荡，尽管他们在七城中是罕见的风景。一小群人从森林山脊冒险下来，作为向导、追踪者、猎人，偶尔也作为奴隶主找到工作。个别半身人通过探索世界上不熟悉的地区来放纵他们的流浪欲望。偶尔，嗜血的叛逆部落会在广阔的荒原上袭击村庄或劫掠商队。",
	"Halflings are among the oldest of the speaking peoples of Athas, and they have a rich oral tradition, a deep understanding of nature, and a complex culture. Halfling tribes on Athas openly practice cannibalism, though usually as a ritualistic matter. Though they rarely deal with outsiders, halflings have been known to work with others for mutual gain. However, anyone who breaks an oath to a halfling tribe will find himself or herself quickly pursued by a band of head hunters. These marauders pose a threat to any traveler who wanders into their hunting grounds.": "半身人是阿萨斯最古老的语言民族之一，他们有丰富的口述传统，对自然有深刻的理解，并有复杂的文化。阿萨斯的半身人部落公开实行食人制，不过通常是作为一种仪式性的事项。虽然他们很少与外人打交道，但半身人也曾为了共同的利益与他人合作。然而，任何违背对半身人部落的誓言的人都会发现自己很快就会被一队猎头人追捕。这些掠夺者对任何闯入他们猎场的旅行者都构成了威胁。",

	"As masters of ambush, forest runners embody the halfling reputation for stealth and cunning. Whether patrolling halfling lands or wandering the wastes, they harry enemies rather than engaging them in pitched battles.

They favor moving up to their enemies and then using strike and slip away to vanish back into the surrounding terrain.": "作为伏击的高手，森林猎手体现了半身人的隐蔽和狡猾的声誉。无论是在半身人的土地上巡逻，还是在荒原上游荡，他们都会骚扰敌人，而不是与他们展开激烈的战斗。凶猛的战士，即使是两三倍于他们体型的敌人，森林飞贼也不害怕。他们依靠隐蔽性、毒药、团队合作和纯粹的野蛮来击败他们的敌人。他们喜欢走到敌人面前，然后使用攻击和溜走，消失在周围的地形中。",

	"As harsh and unyielding as their desert homes, harssafs don't typically deal congenially with others. Harssafs live in and wander the great deserts and barren places of Athas. Seemingly composed of the fire and sand of their home terrain, they live in nomadic bands and frequently raid settlements within or near their homes. Harssafs live mostly insular lives, traveling and raiding throughout a massive section of the Tableland, the Great Aluvial Sand Wastes and the Endless Sand Dunes. Harssafs have no compunctions about killing when necessary, but they take no particular pride in it. Killing to the harssafs is a necessary skill to survive the coming sandstorms that will carry the great desert to the far reaches of the world. Both male and female harssafs stand about 6 feet tall and weigh about 190 pounds. Harssaf communities dot the great deserts of Sarlona. When humans migrated from Sarlona to Khorvaire millennia ago, they brought harssaf slaves with them. Their descendants gather in small tribes in the heart of the Talenta Plains, where the harssafs maintain a tenuous truce with roaming halfling plainsfolk. The halflings of the Talenta Plains refer to these harssaf \"interlopers\" as the Flameborn.": "就像他们的沙漠家园一样严酷和不屈不挠，哈萨夫人通常不与他人友好相处。哈萨夫人生活在阿萨斯的大沙漠和不毛之地，并在那里游荡。他们似乎是由家乡地形的火焰和沙子组成的，他们以游牧为生，经常袭击家乡内部或附近的定居点。哈萨夫人主要过着与世隔绝的生活，在台地的大片区域、大河沙荒和无尽沙丘中旅行和掠夺。哈萨夫人在必要时对杀戮毫无顾忌，但他们对此并不感到特别自豪。对哈萨夫人来说，杀戮是在即将到来的沙暴中生存的必要技能，沙暴会把大沙漠带到世界的远方。男性和女性Harssafs的身高都在6英尺左右，体重约为190磅。哈萨夫社区点缀在萨洛纳的大沙漠中。几千年前，当人类从萨洛纳迁移到霍尔韦尔时，他们带来了哈萨夫奴隶。他们的后代聚集在塔伦塔平原中心的小部落里，在那里，哈萨夫人与游荡的半身人平原人保持着脆弱的休战关系。塔伦塔平原的半身人将这些哈萨夫的 \"闯入者 \"称为火焰人。",
	"Harssaf clans are incredibly structured, composed of a strict caste system of scouts and tenders. Tenders comprise less than one-third of a band's total population, and even they are capable warriors. Consisting mostly of scouts incapable of fighting due to age or infirmity, pregnant females, young children, and the few craftsfolk of the clan, tenders are regarded as second-class citizens. Leaders of the clans always emerge from the scout caste, which consists of any male or female of fighting age. Males and females have an equal opportunity to prove themselves worthy of the scout caste. But females who have children are relegated to be tenders until their children are old enough to be left with others of the caste. Only then can these females return to the scout clan. As a result, children are raised by the clan as a whole, being alternately schooled by different members of the scout caste. These scouts have taken it upon themselves to educate the youngsters in various martial and religious mysteries to ensure they are prepared to choose their career when they come of age.": "哈萨夫部族的结构令人难以置信，由严格的侦察员和补给员的种姓制度组成。补给员只占一个部落总人口的不到三分之一，即使他们也是有能力的战士。补给员主要由因年老或体弱而无法战斗的侦察员、怀孕的女性、年幼的儿童和部落中为数不多的手工艺人组成，他们被视为二等公民。部落的领导人总是从侦察兵种姓中产生，由任何达到战斗年龄的男性或女性组成。男性和女性有平等的机会证明自己有资格成为侦察兵种姓。但是，有孩子的女性被降格为补给员，直到她们的孩子长大到可以和其他种姓的人在一起。只有到那时，这些女性才能回到童子军部族中。因此，孩子们由整个部族抚养，由侦察员种姓的不同成员交替进行教育。这些童子军以各种武术和宗教奥秘教育青少年为己任，以确保他们在成年后为选择职业做好准备。",
	"Harssaf clans sometimes skirmish over resources or territory, but they prefer to avoid fighting other chosen desert dwellers and focus their raids on the soft outlanders. A harssaf camp is usually composed of several small tents shared by tenders, and a few large pavilions where the scouts stay. Due to their natural affinity for hot and sandy environments, harssafs have no problem sleeping in the open desert. Rumors exist of ancient harssaf structures in the deepest deserts, strongholds that all clans visit from time to time. These strongholds are said to hold the history of the mysterious harssaf people, as well as monasteries that devote themselves to schooling the many monks of the harssaf clans.": "哈萨夫部族有时会因为资源或领土而发生小规模冲突，但他们更愿意避免与其他被选中的沙漠居民作战，而把突袭的重点放在软弱的外乡人身上。一个哈萨夫营地通常由几个小帐篷和几个大亭子组成，小兵们住在那里。由于他们天生喜欢炎热和沙质的环境，哈萨夫人睡在空旷的沙漠中没有问题。有传言说，在最深的沙漠中存在着古老的哈萨夫建筑，是所有部族不时访问的据点。这些据点据说保存着神秘的哈萨夫人的历史，以及致力于为哈萨夫部族的众多僧侣提供教育的修道院。",

	"are vestiges of an age when war consumed the world and blood flowed in rivers. Other scholars speculate that the responsibility for these terrors rests at the feet of the sorcerer-kings. Whatever their true origins, no creature on Athas, other than the sorcerer-kings and the Dragon, elicits more fear than a nightmare beast.": "这是一个战争吞噬世界、血流成河的时代的遗迹。其他学者推测，这些恐怖的责任在于巫师国王的脚下。不管它们的真正起源是什么，除了巫师国王和龙之外，阿塔斯的任何生物都不会比噩梦般的野兽更令人恐惧。",
	"Sages believe the nightmare beasts were called from the Gray and bound to Athas through powerful defiling magic. These horrors are a cancer on the world, their noxious presence poisoning land and contaminating water. Creatures indigenous to the haunts of a nightmare beast sicken and die, if they aren't devoured first. Killing one of these monsters does little to remove its stain. The hulking corpse rapidly rots into bubbling bile that renders the area uninhabitable.": "贤者们相信，噩梦般的野兽被从灰色中召唤出来，并通过强大的污秽魔法与阿塔斯结合在一起。这些恐怖的东西是世界上的毒瘤，它们有害的存在毒害了土地并污染了水。梦魇兽出没的地方的生物会生病和死亡，如果它们没有被首先吞噬的话。杀死这些怪物中的一个，并不能消除其污点。巨大的尸体迅速腐烂成冒泡的胆汁，使该地区无法居住。",
	"With a disposition as bad as its reputation, it's no wonder that a nightmare beast spreads terror wherever it goes. This monster has no interest in treasure, nor does it often bring any prey back to its lair, unless the kill is so large that it cannot be consumed all at once. A nightmare beast often inadvertently eats treasures along with their owners, so occasionally items of value turn up in the creature's lair at a later time. Nightmare beasts speak Abyssal.": "噩梦兽的性情和它的名声一样坏，难怪它走到哪里都会散布恐怖。这种怪物对财宝没有兴趣，也不经常把猎物带回它的巢穴，除非猎物太大，无法一次吃完。梦魇兽经常无意中把宝物和它们的主人一起吃掉，所以偶尔会有一些有价值的东西在以后的时间里出现在怪物的巢穴里。梦魇兽说深渊语。",
	"Although little is known of the nightmare beast's life cycle, it is assumed that spawn are adolescent forms. How the beasts put aside their innate hatred long enough to mate is an open and disturbing question.": "虽然人们对噩梦兽的生命周期知之甚少，但据推测，卵子是青春期的形态。这些野兽是如何将它们与生俱来的仇恨搁置足够长的时间来进行交配的，这是一个开放而令人不安的问题。",
	"A nightmare beast does little to conceal its cavernous lair, for its mere presence is enough to cow the land and its inhabitants. Just as a defiler robs the soil of its nourishing properties, so does a nightmare beast despoil its habitat. A nightmare beast's lair lies at the center of a wasted real m, twisted by dark magic and poisoned by its malevolent presence. No other creature is willing or able to cooperate for any period of time with a fully manifested nightmare beast.": "梦魇兽很少掩饰它的洞穴，因为它的存在就足以让土地和居民感到恐惧。就像破坏者剥夺了土壤的滋养特性一样，噩梦兽也会掠夺其栖息地。梦魇兽的巢穴位于荒废的真实世界的中心，被黑暗魔法扭曲，被其邪恶的存在所毒害。没有其他生物愿意或能够与完全显现的梦魇兽进行任何时间的合作。",

	"Secrets of the nightmare beast": "梦魇兽的秘密",
	"Few if any people currently living on Athas know the truth about nightmare beasts. The commonly held theories of the beasts, their origins, and their life cycle are wrong. Each nightmare beast was once another, more mundane predator of the wastelands. In rare instances, as an animal consumes prey within areas connected to the Gray or imbued with substantial defiling magic, the creature slowly begins to change. Energy courses through it, causing it to grow and to develop a limitless hatred for all living things. Once the tainted creature begins to seek and consume sentient beings, it mutates into a nightmare beast.": "目前生活在Athas的人很少知道关于噩梦兽的真相。关于这些野兽、它们的起源和它们的生命周期，普遍持有的理论是错误的。每只梦魇兽都曾经是荒原上另一种更平凡的捕食者。在极少数情况下，当动物在与灰色相连的区域内吞食猎物，或被注入大量的污秽魔法，该生物就会慢慢开始改变。能量穿过它，使它成长，并对所有生物产生无限的憎恨。一旦被玷污的生物开始寻找并吞噬有生命的生物，它就会变异成一只噩梦般的野兽。",
	"Nightmare beast spawn aren't progeny - they are a stage of mutation that some creatures reach before full metamorphosis is achieved.": "噩梦兽卵不是后代--它们是一些生物在实现完全蜕变之前所达到的一个变异阶段。",
	"This, of course, leads to other questions: Why do these creatures all mutate into the same form? Do other, related mutations haunt the farthest reaches of the wastes?": "当然，这也导致了其他问题。为什么这些生物都会变异成同样的形式？其他相关的突变体是否在荒野的最远处出没？",
	"A maw of gladius-sized teeth splits a hulking form covered in armored scales. Tusks as sharp and numerous as the spears of a phalanx sprout from this opening. A nightmare beast stands at least 20 feet tall on its four legs. Each of its digits is tipped with a 3-foot-long claw. Its jaws are filled with 1-foot-long teeth and flanked by curved tusks the size of cavalry lances. A nightmare beast's thick, tough hide is typically dark gray with dark blue, purple, or brown splotches in between patches of bony material. Its red eyes, each the size of a man's head, glow in the dark. The nightmare beast prefers to lair in a remote cave. It spends most of its time in search of food, and it tends to hunt in one area until the food supply is exhausted. At that point, it usually hibernates for up to one year, then awakens again in a ravenous state. Surely nothing so nightmarish could be a living being-and yet it is. The nightmare beast is always ravenous, a mobile source of carnage. The more the beast's hunger is frustrated, the greater the frenzy of its attacks.": "一张大嘴里长满了大刀阔斧的牙齿，劈开了一个覆盖着装甲鳞片的庞大身躯。獠牙像方阵的长矛一样锋利，数量众多，从这个开口处冒出来。一个噩梦般的野兽用它的四条腿站起来至少有20英尺高。它的每个指头上都有一个3英尺长的爪子。它的下颚长着1英尺长的牙齿，两侧是骑兵长矛般大小的弯曲獠牙。梦魇兽厚而坚韧的皮毛通常是深灰色的，在骨质材料的斑块之间有深蓝色、紫色或棕色的斑点。它的红色眼睛，每只都有一个人的头那么大，在黑暗中会发光。梦魇兽喜欢在一个偏远的山洞里藏身。它的大部分时间都在寻找食物，而且往往在一个地区狩猎，直到食物供应耗尽。在这一点上，它通常会冬眠长达一年，然后在饥渴的状态下再次醒来。当然，没有什么东西能像噩梦般的存在，但它确实存在。梦魇兽总是贪婪的，是一个流动的屠杀源。野兽的饥饿感越是受挫，它的攻击就越是疯狂。",
	"Hatred consumes a nightmare beast - only through supreme willpower does it resist its brutish impulses. When possessed of its full faculties, the beast torments its enemies, sending them into nightmare-filled slumber. While its victim thrashes, the beast appears at its side where it can sample the horror firsthand. If a nightmare beast becomes injured, all thought of toying with its enemies vanishes. Its barely contained monstrous nature surges to the fore. Roaring with rage, it rises up on its hind legs, savagely slashing, impaling, and destroying its enemies. The putrid essence of a nightmare beast taints everything around it when the beast dies. At the Dungeon Master's option, the area within 30ft of a slain nightmare beast becomes defiled terrain.": "仇恨吞噬了一只噩梦般的野兽--只有通过最高的意志力才能抵制其野蛮的冲动。当它拥有全部能力时，野兽会折磨它的敌人，使他们进入充满恶梦的沉睡状态。当受害者挣扎时，野兽会出现在其身边，在那里它可以亲身体验恐怖。如果梦魇兽受伤，所有玩弄敌人的想法都会消失。它勉强控制的畸形本性涌上心头。它愤怒地咆哮着，用后腿站起来，野蛮地砍伐、刺穿和摧毁它的敌人。恶梦之兽死亡时，其腐烂的本质会玷污周围的一切。根据地下城管理员的选择，被杀死的恶梦之兽周围30英尺内的区域会变成被玷污的地形。",

Ak'chazar rakshasas typically work behind the scenes, manipulating events to suit their dark whims and relying on their web of spies, assassins, and intelligent undead to carry out their nefarious plots. Ak'chazar rakshasas do associate with other rakshasas, often as leaders or manipulators. Other types of rakshasas value an ak'chazar's intelligence even as they fear its abilities. It is not uncommon for weaker rakshasas to follow the complex plans of an ak'chazar even as they go about their own missions. All rakshasas tend toward solitary existences, but communication and coordination between the various kinds is not unheard of.": "Ak'chazar rakshas在各个星球上游荡，寻找可以征服的新土地和可以奴役的新的亡灵爪牙。这些rakshas是死灵魔法的大师，尽管他们在其他的魔法流派中也很强大。Ak'chazar rakshas通常在幕后工作，操纵事件以适应他们黑暗的想法，并依靠他们的间谍、刺客和聪明的亡灵网络来执行他们邪恶的计划。Ak'chazar rakshasas确实与其他rakshasas有联系，通常是作为领导者或操纵者。其他类型的rakshas重视ak'chazar的智慧，即使他们害怕其能力。弱小的rakshas遵循ak'chazar的复杂计划，甚至在执行自己的任务时也是很常见的。所有的rakshas都倾向于单独存在，但各种类型的rakshas之间的沟通和协调也不是没有过。",
	"An ak'chazar rakshasa typically establishes a power base at the site of a great battle, a city of the dead, or some other place where a large number of corpses might be interred. It uses its power over undead to create several intelligent undead minions. Thereafter, it might make contact with a local underworld organization (almost always through intermediaries) or even a corrupt or power-hungry political official.": "阿卡扎尔罗刹通常会在一场大战役的现场、一座亡灵之城或其他一些可能埋有大量尸体的地方建立一个权力基地。它利用其对亡灵的力量，创造出几个智能的亡灵奴仆。此后，它可能会与当地的黑社会组织（几乎总是通过中间人），甚至是腐败的或渴望权力的政治官员取得联系。",
	"It will play with these leaders, offering them advice, power, or riches as it learns their habits and defining characteristics. Then the ak'chazar uses its magic jar spell-like ability to replace one of these leaders for a time, using the borrowed body to solidify its hold on the region.": "它将与这些领导人玩耍，在了解他们的习惯和决定性特征后，向他们提供建议、权力或财富。然后，阿卡扎尔用它的魔罐法术般的能力，在一段时间内取代这些领导人中的一个，用借来的身体来巩固它在该地区的地位。",
	"Several of the House Tsalaxa high officials are actually ak'chazar rakshasas. They sequester themselves in foreboding strongholds or warehouses hidden in the waste, although some have made lairs closer to the heart of civilization in the city states.

	"While some theorize that rakshasas are the very embodiment of evil, those rare few who have survived an encounter with the deadly naztharune know it as fact. Like other rakshasas, the palms of a naztharune rakshasa's hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a human. While this physical feature doesn't detract from the creature's manual dexterity, it makes a rakshasa look very disturbing to those unfamiliar with the creature. Naztharune rakshasas, like most rakshasas, tend to be solitary creatures but will work with other rakshasas when necessary and even team up with other naztharunes on a continuing basis.": "虽然有些人理论上认为罗刹是邪恶的化身，但那些与致命的naztharune相遇后幸存下来的极少数人知道这是事实。与其他罗刹一样，纳札罗刹的手掌位于人类手背的位置。虽然这一身体特征并不影响该生物的手动灵活性，但它使罗刹在那些不熟悉该生物的人看来非常令人不安。像大多数罗刹一样，Naztharune罗刹往往是孤独的生物，但在必要时也会与其他罗刹合作，甚至与其他naztharunes持续合作。",
	"They sometimes work as infiltrators and spies for ak'chazar rakshasas, and they sometimes hire themselves out to other creatures as mercenaries or assassins. Naztharune rakshasas have a hearty contempt for all creatures except other rakshasas, but they can suppress this feeling when it profits them to do so. Unlike most of their rakshasa brethren, naztharune rakshasas feel less of a need to be \"the boss\" in every operation. They are much more mercenary in their desires and needs.": "他们有时为ak'chazar rakshasas充当渗透者和间谍，他们有时将自己出租给其他生物作为雇佣兵或刺客。Naztharune rakshasas对所有的生物都有一种强烈的蔑视，除了其他rakshasas，但当他们这样做对他们有利时，他们可以抑制这种感觉。与他们的大多数罗刹兄弟不同，纳兹塔鲁恩罗刹觉得没有必要在每次行动中当 \"老大\"。他们在欲望和需求方面更加唯利是图。",
	"Most naztharune rakshasas serve the ak'chazar and rajah rakshasas as spies and assassins. A pair of ak'chazar rakshasas operating in Raam has sent naztharune agents to stir up unrest in neighboring cities-states, most notably in Urik, Raj, and Tyr. These naztharune rakshasas have already compromised several local guilds and eliminated key politicians and merchants in an attempt to turn the cities' hatred of one another into open war. Naztharune rakshasas have also been encountered in cities as far south as Balic, in some cases pursuing their own agendas.": "大多数naztharune rakshasas为ak'chazar和rajah rakshasas服务，作为间谍和刺客。一对在Raam活动的ak'chazar rakshas已经派出naztharune特工在邻近的城邦挑起动乱，最明显的是在Urik、Raj和Tyr。这些naztharune rakshasas已经破坏了几个当地的行会，并消灭了关键的政治家和商人，试图将城市之间的仇恨变成公开的战争。Naztharune rakshas在最南端的巴利克（Balic）等城市也遇到过，在某些情况下，他们追求自己的议程。",

During the day the sunlight refracts through it, reflecting a myriad of colors which change as it moves. At night it reflects any ambient light, retaining its colors but not as radiant as during the day. When the spider has fed, it takes on a reddish tinge but this fades over a few days. A crystal spider is incapable of making sounds, but can communicate with others of its kind by means of controlled light. Crystal spiders get most of their nutrients from sunlight but do require liquids to survive, preferring human blood. They are hunted for their webs, which make excellent weapons, and for the gems which they instinctively weave into these webs (although the spiders are themselves unaware of their value).": "水晶蜘蛛类似于巨大的狼蛛，它们的身体由多面水晶组成，能创造出令人眼花缭乱的折射光线的图案。它们编织的玻璃网非常锋利，可以将具有破坏性的光束集中到潜在受害者身上。水晶蜘蛛是一种美丽的生物。白天，阳光通过它折射，反射出无数的颜色，随着它的移动而变化。在晚上，它反射任何环境光线，保留其颜色，但不像白天那样光彩夺目。当蜘蛛进食后，它会呈现出红色，但几天后就会褪去。水晶蜘蛛不能发声，但可以通过控制光线的方式与其他同类沟通。水晶蜘蛛的大部分营养来自阳光，但也需要液体来生存，更喜欢人血。人们猎杀它们是因为它们的网，它是极好的武器，也因为它们本能地将宝石织进这些网中（尽管蜘蛛自己并不知道它们的价值）。",

For the ssurrans, the ideal battle is one where you and a large amount of your fellows strike from ambush, surprise the foe and over-run him with sheer numbers.

Tareks have a distinct musky odor that can be detected from as far away as 15 feet.": "塔里克是身材高大、肌肉发达、无毛的双足动物，居住在阿萨斯的丘陵和山区。他们有方形的、大骨架的头，有倾斜的额头和巨大的眉脊。他们平坦的鼻子有张开的鼻孔，圆顶的嘴里长满了锋利的牙齿。他们强有力的手臂非常长，以至于他们的指关节在地面上拖动。塔里克人有一种明显的麝香气味，在15英尺远的地方就能闻到。",
	"Tareks gather in tribes, building small communities in the hills and mountains of the Tyr region. These communities often sustain themselves by raiding, and visitors are not welcome. Unless a group of visitors include an obvious elemental cleric, tarek warriors rush out to kill or drive the intruders away In rare instances, members of a community will be sent out to trade with merchant caravans, but few traders will blindly conduct business with these representatives. More often than not, such representatives are decoys for an unseen raiding party. More than one caravan has been taken by surprise while negotiating a deal with tarek traders.": "塔里克人以部落形式聚集，在蒂尔地区的丘陵和山区建立小型社区。这些社区通常靠掠夺来维持，不欢迎访客。除非一群访客中包括一个明显的元素牧师，否则塔里克战士会冲出去杀死或赶走入侵者。在极少数情况下，社区成员会被派去与商队交易，但很少有商人会盲目地与这些代表进行交易。更多时候，这些代表是看不见的突击队的诱饵。不止一个商队在与塔雷克商人谈判时被打了个措手不及。",
	"The Tarek has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least on eof the Tarek's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't {@condition incapacitated}.": "如果塔里克的盟友中至少有一人在该生物的5英尺范围内，而该盟友不在该生物的5英尺范围内，则塔里克在对该生物的攻击卷中具有优势（%0%）。",
	"If damage reduces the tarek to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, the tarek drops to 1 hit point instead.": "如果伤害使塔雷克的命中率降至0，它必须做一个宪法救赎动作，DC为5+所受伤害，除非伤害是来自关键打击。如果成功，塔雷克会下降到1点生命值。",
	"The Tarek makes 2 attacks.": "塔雷克人进行了2次攻击。",
	"Aggressive savages": "好斗的野蛮人",
	"of Athas's hilly and mountainous regions, tareks are the bane of borderland communities. Xenophobic, hateful and hostile, tareks frequently find themselves in conflict with the other races of the Tablelands. A tarek is so fierce in its love of life that it can continue to fight when lesser races would have succumbed to their wounds.": "在阿塔斯的丘陵和山区，塔里克是边境地区社区的祸根。仇外、憎恨和敌对，塔里克经常发现自己与台地的其他种族发生冲突。塔里克对生命的热爱是如此的强烈，以至于当较小的种族已经屈服于他们的伤口时，他们还能继续战斗。",
	"According to legend, an entity of mad destruction created the tareks. These fierce warriors served as its instruments of murder and destruction. The earth shamans eventually led the tareks in revolt against their maker.": "根据传说，一个疯狂破坏的实体创造了塔雷克。这些凶猛的战士是其谋杀和破坏的工具。大地巫师最终领导塔里克人反抗他们的制造者。",
	"Tareks are muscle-bound brutes that are known for their great constitution and will to live. They look dull-witted, with their squared heads with sloping foreheads, and are about as smart as the average half giant. Their features lend them a fearsome presence that has earned them a well-deserved reputation as dangerous foes. Tareks have a distinct musky odor that can be detected from as far away as 30 ft.": "塔里克是肌肉发达的野蛮人，以其强大的体魄和生存意志而闻名。他们看起来头脑迟钝，头是方形的，额头是倾斜的，和一般半巨人一样聪明。他们的特征给他们带来了可怕的存在感，使他们当之无愧地成为危险的敌人。塔里克有一种明显的麝香味，从30英尺远的地方就能闻到。",
	"Tareks are children of the earth and have been known to wage great wars against the gith, with whom they compete for territory and whom they see as defiling the earth by their very presence. They also hate elves because of their association with magic and its effect upon the earth they hold so sacred. Tareks place great value in honor and physical prowess. For a tarek, Strength is a fundamental issue. The raw, competitive nature of their lives means that a tarek must be aware of his position in the tribe at any given time and this position is determined through physical contest. When joining a group, it is quite normal to expect the uneducated tarek to use physical force to determine his place in things. The more cosmopolitan among the species have learned that other races sometimes take offence at this behavior.": "塔里克是大地之子，众所周知，他们与地精争夺领土，并认为地精的存在玷污了大地，因此对地精发动了巨大的战争。他们还憎恨精灵，因为他们与魔法有关，而且魔法对他们认为非常神圣的大地有影响。塔里克非常重视荣誉和体能。对于塔里克来说，力量是一个基本问题。他们生活的原始性和竞争性意味着塔里克在任何时候都必须意识到自己在部落中的地位，而这种地位是通过体能竞赛决定的。当加入一个团体时，没有受过教育的塔雷克用身体力量来决定自己的地位是很正常的。该物种中更具有世界性的人已经知道，其他种族有时会对这种行为感到不满。",
	"The tarek language is much like that of the dwarves harsh and guttural, and very fearsome in tone. Non-tarek speakers have been known to suffer from throat pains after half an hour of speaking the tongue. Tareks are fiercely protective of their language and proud of the strength needed to speak it. Tareks will teach their language to other races, but the pupil normally has to undergo the regular tarek method of assessment first in order to determine his worth (i.e.: a beating).": "塔里克的语言很像矮人的语言，刺耳而粗犷，语气非常可怕。据了解，不讲塔里克语的人在讲了半小时后会出现喉咙疼痛的情况。塔里克人对自己的语言有强烈的保护意识，并为说这种语言所需的力量感到自豪。塔里克会把他们的语言教给其他种族，但学生通常要先接受常规的塔里克评估方法，以确定其价值（即：殴打）。",
	"Tarek communities often support themselves by raiding, and visitors are not welcome. Unless a group of visitors includes an obvious elemental earth cleric, the tareks will attempt to drive them away. In rare instances, members of a community will be sent out to trade with a merchant caravan, but few traders will blindly conduct business with these representatives. More often than not, such representatives are a decoy for an unseen raiding party.": "塔里克社区经常通过掠夺来维持自己的生活，不欢迎访客。除非一群访客中包括一个明显的土元素牧师，否则塔里克人会试图把他们赶走。在极少数情况下，一个社区的成员会被派去与商队进行贸易，但很少有商人会盲目地与这些代表进行交易。更多时候，这些代表是看不见的突击队的诱饵。",
	"Tareks move with jerky, awkward strides, except when engaged in combat. Then they exhibit a style and grace usually uncommon in creatures of their size and build. To watch them engage in combat is to watch fluid motions that are as artistic as dance unless the viewer happens to be on the receiving end of the deadly spectacle. While tareks will use weapons, they shun armor of any sort, instead relying on their tough hides and natural combat agility to protect them.": "塔里克的行动笨拙，步履蹒跚，除非是在战斗中。然后他们表现出一种通常在他们这种体型和身材的生物中不常见的风格和优雅。观看他们的战斗就像观看流畅的动作，就像观看舞蹈一样艺术，除非观众恰好处于这种致命场面的接受端。虽然塔里克会使用武器，但他们回避任何形式的盔甲，而是依靠他们坚韧的皮毛和天然的战斗敏捷性来保护自己。",
	"Tareks revere earth shamans for being both sages and warriors. Earth shamans sometimes give an enchanted weapon to the most virile of the tribe's leaders, signaling a new chief among the people.": "塔里克人崇尚大地巫师，因为他们既是圣人又是战士。大地巫师有时会给部落中最有活力的领导人一件施了魔法的武器，这预示着人民中的新酋长。",
	"The Tarek is a 6th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell {@dc 12}, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The tarek has the following cleric spells prepared:": "塔雷克是一个6级的施法者。它的法术能力是智慧（法术（%0%），用法术攻击+4命中）。塔雷克准备了以下牧师法术。",
	"The Tarek summons a gargoyle. The summoned gargoyle appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other elementals. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.": "塔雷克召唤一只夜行神龙。被召唤的夜行神龙出现在其召唤者60英尺范围内的一个无人空间，作为其召唤者的盟友，并且不能召唤其他元素。它将持续10分钟，直到它或它的召唤者死亡，或直到它的召唤者以行动方式将其解除。",

	"The other denizens of the Tyr region commonly refer to the tari as ratmen. They are small, furry humanoid scavengers, capable of thriving on food and water too polluted for humans to ingest. Bunted freely as pests, the tari are the barbaric descendants of a once thriving culture who inhabited lands to the south of the Tyr region.": "蒂尔地区的其他居民通常把塔里人称为鼠人。他们是小型的、毛茸茸的人形食腐动物，能够以人类无法摄入的污染严重的食物和水为生。作为害虫，塔里人是曾经繁荣的文化的野蛮后裔，他们居住在泰尔地区南部的土地上。",
	"The lives of the urban and wilderness tari are quite different, though their tactics for the kill are universal. Both travel in packs, but their approaches to survival are quite different.": "城市和野外的塔里人的生活是相当不同的，尽管他们的杀戮策略是通用的。两者都是成群结队地旅行，但他们的生存方式却截然不同。",
	"The urban tari are denizens of the sewers and garbage heaps. The small, furry thieves scour the buildings, scurrying up walls and through windows, stealing everything they can. They are not particularly good thieves, making a lot of noise, upsetting tables and toppling chairs in their clumsy approach. However, not work for children, a warrior can earn a good living hunting tari, earning about eight ceramic pieces a head.": "城市中的塔里是下水道和垃圾堆的居民。这些小的、毛茸茸的小偷在建筑物里到处乱窜，爬上墙，穿过窗户，偷他们能偷的东西。它们并不是特别好的小偷，它们发出很大的噪音，在笨拙的做法中弄翻了桌子和椅子。然而，这不是孩子们的工作，一个战士可以靠猎取塔里赚取丰厚的收入，一个人大约可以赚取8个陶瓷片。",
	"The wilderness, however, is not so kind. Wasteland tari are nomadic scavengers, scouting miles in all directions to find the richest grounds, contending with the desert's other creatures for the little food to be had.": "然而，荒原并不那么友好。荒地塔里是游牧的清道夫，他们在各个方向寻找最富饶的地方，与沙漠中的其他生物争夺可以得到的少量食物。",

	"The tari race once boasted a thriving culture far to the south of the Tyr region. Ythri, the legendary capital city, is now a ruin lost among the crags. Their education and knowledge was much greater than today and their technology allowed them to build stone and concrete structures. What happened to their civilization is a mystery. The tari of the Tyr region have no written history. What remains is a collection of exaggerated myths and legends describing wondrous works.": "塔里族曾经在提尔地区南部拥有繁荣的文化。传说中的首都Ythri，现在已经成为一片废墟，消失在峭壁之中。他们的教育和知识比今天要丰富得多，他们的技术使他们能够建造石头和混凝土结构。他们的文明发生了什么，是一个谜。泰尔地区的塔里人没有书面历史。留下的是一些夸张的神话和传说的集合，描述了一些奇妙的作品。",
	"Two glands set deep in the jaw produce their disease-causing venom. Each bite produces a flow of venom that sprays from two openings to either side of the main canines. Retrieving the glands from fallen tari is a difficult and dangerous task, but the deadly properties of their contents makes them valuable to the alchemists and bards of the cities. A pair of tari disease glands can bring as much as 12 ceramic bits in the larger cities.": "颚部深处的两个腺体产生其致病的毒液。每咬一口都会产生一股毒液，从主犬齿两侧的两个开口喷出。从倒下的塔里身上取回腺体是一项困难而危险的任务，但其内容物的致命特性使它们对城市的炼金术士和吟游诗人来说很有价值。在较大的城市中，一对塔里病腺体可以带来多达12个陶瓷位。",

Not surprisingly, templars tend to abuse the powers they have for their own personal gain which, so long as the city is administered and kept in order, does not bother the sorcerer-king. Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks. Every templar NPC can be counted on to accept underhanded schemes that will help him rise to power among his fellows.": "圣殿骑士是城邦中最令人恐惧的人。他们有权力以任何理由指控和监禁几乎所有的人，使城市居民处于恐怖之中。毫不奇怪，圣殿骑士倾向于为自己的个人利益滥用权力，只要城市得到管理并保持秩序，就不会让巫师国王感到困扰。圣殿骑士在一个特定的城市国家中执行三项重要职能。首先，他们包括城市卫队和巫师国王军队的官员。其次，他们负责管理城市，维持其商业运作，并为其奴隶提供食物。最后，圣殿骑士负责维持巫师国王是神的假象，他们有绝对的权力强制人们对巫师国王的崇拜和敬意。每个圣殿骑士团的NPC都会积极追求其中的一个职能。圣殿骑士的最后一项不成文的职能是尽可能快地在他们的队伍中晋升。圣殿骑士获得权力和地位的手段是开放的，包括贿赂、盗窃，甚至暗杀他们队伍中的其他人。每一个圣殿骑士的NPC都可以被指望接受暗中的计划，以帮助他在他的伙伴们中获得权力。",
