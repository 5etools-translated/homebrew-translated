	"Aarakocras are hunters and scavengers that eat just about any meat they find. They loot whatever they can from victims claimed by the wastes. Most residents of Athas try to avoid aarakocras, considering them to be sordid opportunists, but the vulture-folk have few sworn enemies. The aarakocras keep to the skies, and their homes are built high on cliffs or mesa tops. From there, scouts search the nearby desert for food and intruders. Their sharp eyes miss little in the barren wilds, and a tribe brooks no intrusion on its territory without receiving tribute in compensation. Lost travelers who pay the requested amount might receive guidance to a landmark or a safer part of the wilderness. If rebuffed, the aarakocras won't hesitate to kidnap members of a trespassing party and hold them for ransom. To avoid harassment, merchant houses sometimes make deals with powerful aarakocra tribes; weaker tribes, reluctant to draw the ire of their stronger kin, leave those merchants alone. Despite their reputation as distasteful scavengers, aarakocras are deeply spiritual. They revere the sky and the sun as primal entities. Those members of a tribe that wield primal power use spirits and elementals to aid their kin in mundane tasks as well as in battle. Aarakocras are rarely found in the company of other humanoids, although they sometimes work with kenku tribes. They also follow raiders or dangerous monsters from the air, picking off survivors of the predators' attacks. Aarakocras train flying beasts as pets, and they use rituals to bring air elementals and spirits into the world. Slavers steal aarakocra young and eggs, selling the creatures to nobles and merchant houses as slaves. These nobles and merchants, in turn, put the vulture folk to work as soldiers and scouts.": "Aarakocras是猎人和拾荒者，几乎吃任何他们找到的肉。他们从荒原上的受害者身上掠夺任何他们能得到的东西。Athas的大多数居民都尽量避免Aarakocras，认为他们是肮脏的机会主义者，但秃鹫民族很少有死敌。aarakocras一直在天空中，他们的家都建在悬崖或山顶的高处。在那里，侦察员在附近的沙漠中搜寻食物和入侵者。他们锐利的目光在荒芜的荒野中几乎没有错过，一个部落在没有收到贡品作为补偿的情况下，不会容忍对其领土的入侵。付出所需费用的迷路者可能会得到指引，前往一个地标或荒野中更安全的地方。如果遭到拒绝，阿拉库拉人会毫不犹豫地绑架闯入者的成员并勒索赎金。为了避免骚扰，商行有时会与强大的阿拉科拉部落进行交易；较弱的部落不愿意招致其强大亲属的愤怒，会放过这些商人。尽管他们被誉为令人讨厌的清道夫，但阿拉科拉人有很深的灵性。他们崇尚天空和太阳，视其为最原始的实体。那些拥有原始力量的部落成员利用精神和元素来帮助他们的亲属完成世俗的任务和战斗。Aarakocras很少与其他人类为伍，尽管他们有时与Kenku部落合作。他们还从空中跟踪突袭者或危险的怪物，在掠夺者的攻击中挑选幸存者。Aarakocras把飞行兽当作宠物来训练，他们用仪式把空气元素和精神带入世界。奴隶主偷取阿拉科克拉的幼崽和蛋，将这些生物作为奴隶卖给贵族和商行。这些贵族和商人反过来又把秃鹰人当作士兵和侦察兵来使用。",

	"who curse the blazing sun overhead might breathe a sigh of relief when the crimson orb sets, but their solace proves short lived as the shapes sliding beneath the dunes reveal themselves. When the sun dies away, the primitive, simple-minded anakores burst from the sands, eager to seize the prey they have stealthily tracked during the daylight hours.": "当深红色的球体落下时，那些诅咒头顶上的烈日的人可能会松一口气，但他们的安慰被证明是短暂的，因为沙丘下滑动的形状暴露了自己。当太阳消失时，原始的、头脑简单的Anakores从沙地上冲了出来，渴望抓住他们在白天隐秘地追踪的猎物。",
	"Anakores live beneath loose dunes of dust or sand. They can sense vibrations of prey passing on the surface, and some anakores can smell blood spilled on the earth above. Only ravenous anakores attack prey during the day. Instead, they lurk beneath the sands and track promising game until sunset.": "Anakores生活在松散的尘埃或沙丘下面。它们能感觉到猎物在地面上经过时的振动，有些Anakores能闻到洒在地面上的血迹。只有贪婪的Anakores会在白天攻击猎物。相反，它们潜伏在沙子下面，追踪有希望的猎物，直到日落。",
	"These nomadic creatures follow prey from place to place, seldom lairing in one location for long. They travel and hunt in small packs, and the most successful stalker among them is their leader. Anakores usually bring down as many kills as they can before retreating to feast. Each member of the pack has a role in the attack. Dune kings burst from the sand with great force, leading the attack and unsettling the terrain to provide the anakores with an advantage. Renders tear into the quarry savagely, weakening them before the kill. Hunters separate individual victims from the group, dragging them below the sand one by one.": "这些游牧生物跟随猎物从一个地方到另一个地方，很少在一个地方停留很长时间。它们成群结队地旅行和狩猎，其中最成功的跟踪者是它们的领袖。阿纳科里人通常在撤退前尽可能多地击倒一些猎物，然后再去大吃一顿。群体中的每个成员在攻击中都有一个角色。沙丘之王以巨大的力量从沙地上迸发出来，领导进攻，使地形动荡不安，为阿纳科尔人提供优势。撕裂者野蛮地撕咬猎物，在杀戮前削弱他们的力量。猎手们将个别受害者从群体中分离出来，将他们一个个拖到沙地下面。",
	"While on the move, anakores subsist on roots, including poisonous specimens that aid in the production of the anakore paralytic. A telltale sign of recent anakore movement is an area filled with fallen, rootless plants. Occasionally, a particularly cunning dune king disposes of the foliage so as not to give away the pack's presence but this level of craftiness is rare. Little is known about the origins of the anakores. According to an ancient tale, terrors from beyond the sky touched the humanoids that were forebears of the creatures. Afterward, these ancestors recoiled from the burning sun and burrowed below the wastes to find cool, embracing darkness. Beneath the sands, the creatures dreamed dark reveries and became nightmares of the desert. No discernible characteristics distinguish anakores as male or female. It is whispered that the creatures produce no young, instead dragging selected victims to weird hollows under the sands. Inside these wombs, the captives become new anakores rather than meals. How and why the anakores choose particular individuals as their new kin is unknown.": "在移动过程中，阿纳科人以根为生，包括帮助生产阿纳科麻痹剂的有毒标本。最近Anakore移动的一个明显标志是一个充满了倒下的无根植物的区域。偶尔，一个特别狡猾的沙丘之王会把这些叶子处理掉，以免泄露族群的存在，但这种程度的狡猾是罕见的。关于Anakores的起源，人们知之甚少。根据一个古老的传说，来自天外的恐怖触动了作为这些生物祖先的人形动物。之后，这些祖先从灼热的太阳中退缩，钻入荒野之下，寻找凉爽、包容的黑暗。在沙子下面，这些生物做着黑暗的梦，成为沙漠的噩梦。没有明显的特征来区分Anakores是男是女。据传，这些生物不生孩子，而是把选定的受害者拖到沙子下面的奇怪空地上。在这些子宫里，被俘虏的人成为新的Anakores而不是食物。Anakores如何以及为什么选择特定的人作为他们的新亲属，尚不清楚。",
	"Anakores avoid battle on terrain in which they cannot burrow. They appear with others of their kind or with other burrowing creatures such as bulettes, hejkins, galeb duhrs and kruthiks. Wasteland raiders convince groups of anakores to work for them by paying the creatures with food and shiny baubles. Dreams and visions also entice anakores to explore ancient ruins where other aberrant creatures dwell, some of which are stronger and cleverer than even the dune kings. In such places, anakores serve these creatures and join in their incomprehensible rites. Anakores burrow under prey before rising to attack. Hunters emerge, grab targets, and use drag under to reduce the number of enemies they must face. Renders burst from the sands, stay among the prey topside, and lay targets low to make them more vulnerable to allied attacks. A dune king launches into battle with sand eruption and uses its toxic claws to prevent the quarry from escaping. When caught in poor tactical situations, anakores flee or deal peacefully (but grudgingly) with enemies.": "Anakores避免在它们无法钻入的地形上作战。它们与其他同类或其他穴居生物一起出现，如bulettes、hejkins、galeb duhrs和kruthiks。荒原突袭者通过向这些生物支付食物和闪亮的饰物来说服一群Anakores为他们工作。梦境和幻觉也诱使阿纳科里人去探索其他反常生物居住的古代遗迹，其中一些甚至比沙丘之王更强大和更聪明。在这些地方，Anakores为这些生物服务，并加入他们难以理解的仪式。Anakores在上升到攻击之前，先在猎物下面钻洞。猎人出现，抓住目标，并使用拖拽来减少他们必须面对的敌人的数量。撕裂者从沙地上冲出来，留在猎物的上方，将目标压低，使其更容易受到联盟的攻击。沙丘之王以沙子喷发的方式投入战斗，用它的毒爪来阻止猎物逃跑。当陷入糟糕的战术局面时，沙丘王会逃跑或与敌人和平相处（但很勉强）。",

	"Over the centuries, life-warping magic in the remote wilderness has spawned many perverse creatures, including braxats. They arose from four-legged reptilian beasts similar to mekillots, gaining sentience and a malicious nature under a grim magical influence. A braxat is a hulking, bipedal, lizardlike humanoid that towers over many giants at its full adult height of 15 feet. Its features are a combination of those of a rhinoceros and a spiny beetle. The top of its head and its back are lined with thick, horncovered plates, and a single, massive horn juts up from between its nostrils. Creatures smaller and weaker than a braxat can expect contempt from it at best and death at worst. Anything as big and powerful as a braxat - including other braxats - is a target of its hate and competitiveness. When facing stronger foes, braxats sometimes overlook their rivalries to band together. They particularly detest giants and ally to raid giants' tribes. Braxats also come together in mated pairs or in service to more powerful overlords. They mate only when food is plentiful and shelter, such as a cavern or a buried ruin, is available for the eggs and hatchlings. Even so, one braxat that has a desire to mate must subjugate another to this purpose. Similarly, anyone who wishes to employ a braxat must first prove stronger than the creature or help it gain more food and wealth than it could amass on its own. Adult braxats fight to the death rather than submit to an untested foe.": "几个世纪以来，偏远荒野中的生命扭曲魔法催生了许多反常的生物，包括Braxats。他们产生于类似于Mekillots的四脚爬行动物，在严峻的魔法影响下获得了知觉和恶意的本质。布拉克萨特是一个巨大的、双足的、类似蜥蜴的人形生物，成年后的身高达到15英尺，比许多巨人还高。它的特征是犀牛和带刺甲虫的结合。它的头顶和背部都有厚厚的、覆盖着角的板块，一只巨大的角从它的鼻孔之间伸出来。比貔貅更小、更弱的生物，最好的情况是被它蔑视，最坏的情况是被它杀死。任何像牙签一样大和强大的东西--包括其他牙签--都是它仇恨和竞争的目标。当面对更强大的敌人时，Braxats有时会忽略他们的竞争而联合起来。他们特别厌恶巨人，并结盟突袭巨人的部落。貔貅也会以交配的方式走到一起，或为更强大的霸主服务。它们只有在食物充足，且有洞穴或被掩埋的废墟等庇护所可供产卵和孵化的情况下才交配。即便如此，一个有交配欲望的Braxat必须为此目的而征服另一个。同样，任何想雇佣貔貅的人都必须首先证明自己比貔貅更强壮，或者帮助它获得比它自己能积累的更多食物和财富。成年貔貅会拼死抵抗，而不是屈服于一个未经考验的敌人。",
	"Few creatures have enough power to earn the respect of an adult braxat. Strong leaders who promise success in hunting and pillaging might win over a braxat by appealing to its mercenary streak. Sometimes a braxat agrees to serve as muscle for a potent evil being. Only the foulest humanoids can tolerate a braxat's cruelty and violence. Braxats respect neither law nor authority, and they fear no one. Their awesome strength, psionic abilities, and damage reduction make them nearly unstoppable, and it is not uncommon for a single band of them to wipe out several humanoid settlements in the course of a year. Occasionally a few survivors from braxat raids band together and try to hunt the creatures down, but rarely do they succeed in exacting vengeance. Experienced adventurers have been known to hunt braxats for sport, pitting their experience and cleverness against the creatures' raw cunning and psionic abilities. As such hunters have discovered to their dismay, braxats are quite proficient at protecting themselves with deadly traps and ambushes. Most such hunts end in victory for the braxats, but now and then one is successful, yielding a few braxat-horn trophies to the hunters. These horns have no value in themselves, but artists sometimes carve intricate sculptures on them and sell them as art objects.": "很少有生物有足够的力量来赢得成年布拉萨的尊重。承诺在狩猎和掠夺中获得成功的强大领导者可能会通过吸引貔貅的雇佣精神而赢得貔貅的青睐。有时，貔貅会同意为一个强大的邪恶生物充当肌肉。只有最肮脏的人类才能容忍布拉萨的残忍和暴力。布拉萨特既不尊重法律，也不尊重权威，他们不惧怕任何人。他们令人敬畏的力量、幻觉能力和伤害减免使他们几乎不可阻挡，在一年的时间里，他们中的一队人马消灭几个人形定居点是很常见的。偶尔会有一些布拉萨特袭击的幸存者联合起来，试图猎杀这些生物，但他们很少能成功地进行报复。经验丰富的冒险家们已经知道将猎杀Braxats作为一项运动，用他们的经验和聪明才智来对抗这种生物的原始狡猾和幻觉能力。正如这些猎人所发现的那样，布拉萨特非常善于用致命的陷阱和伏击来保护自己。大多数这样的狩猎都是以貔貅的胜利而告终，但偶尔也会有一次成功，给猎人带来一些貔貅角的战利品。这些角本身没有价值，但艺术家有时会在上面雕刻复杂的雕塑，并作为艺术品出售。",
	"An enterprising or lucky braxat might become the chieftain of a raiding tribe of savage and callous humanoids. Such a band boldly claims a wide swath of territory and turns the choicest morsels and treasures over to its brutal chief. Braxats have no loyalty, however, and if food grows scarce, they will turn on weaker allies, other braxats, and even members of their own families. Braxats live in a tribal society in which males and females have equal social status and access to leadership positions. Each tribal leader must prove his or her worthiness annually in a ritual combat with a single challenger who has earned the right of contest through successful raiding over the past year. Young braxats are trained to fight from the time they can stand. Deadly combat between young braxats over potential mates, lairs, or treasure is encouraged to ensure that only the strongest and cleverest survive to reproduce.": "一个有进取心的或幸运的Braxat可能会成为一个由野蛮和冷酷的人类组成的袭击部落的首领。这样的部落大胆地宣称拥有广阔的领土，并将最美味的食物和财物交给其残暴的首领。然而，Braxats没有忠诚度，如果食物越来越少，他们会转向较弱的盟友、其他Braxats，甚至是他们自己的家庭成员。布拉哈特人生活在一个部落社会中，男性和女性拥有平等的社会地位和获得领导职位的机会。每个部落领袖必须在每年的仪式上与一个挑战者进行战斗，以证明他或她的价值，这个挑战者在过去一年里通过成功的突袭赢得了竞争的权利。年轻的Braxats从他们能够站立的时候就开始训练战斗。为了确保只有最强壮和最聪明的人能够存活下来繁衍后代，年轻的Braxats之间为争夺潜在的配偶、巢穴或财宝而进行的致命战斗受到鼓励。",

	"These territorial predators came into existence through defiling magic. Dune reapers consume everything they find: They devour humanoids and beasts, graze on plants, and even chew through wagons and buildings. They sometimes eat stones to aid digestion of tougher materials. Reapers that go too long without food resort to cannibalism. Familial groups called prides break into packs to hunt the wastes. A pride makes its home near a water source, forming a hive that becomes the center of the pride's territory. Hives are mounds of sand, earth, and rock sealed together with secretions from the drones. Within the mounds are tunnels and chambers, which might be connected to existing underground spaces or structures, especially those containing sources of water. Humanoids can exist close to a hive only if the reapers have another plentiful source of food.": "这些领地掠夺者是通过玷污魔法而存在的。沙丘收割者吞噬它们发现的一切。它们吞噬人类和野兽，吃植物，甚至咀嚼马车和建筑物。它们有时会吃石头来帮助消化更坚硬的材料。长时间没有食物的死神会采用食人的方式。被称为 \"骄傲 \"的家族式群体会分成几群，在荒原上捕猎。一个王族在水源附近安家，形成一个蜂巢，成为王族领土的中心。蜂巢是由沙子、泥土和岩石组成的土堆，用无人机的分泌物密封起来。巢穴内有隧道和密室，可能与现有的地下空间或结构相连，特别是那些含有水源的地方。只有当收割者有另一个丰富的食物来源时，人类才能在靠近蜂巢的地方生存。",
	"Dune reaper warriors are always female and rule over the smaller drones and shrieks, all of which are male. Each warrior forms a hunting pack with multiple drones and shrieks as mates; the other reapers can become erratic if she is slain. A warrior's mates closely match her in power, ensuring that only the strongest reapers reproduce. The dominant female in the pride, known as the matron, makes all decisions, guides the pride to new territory, and directs followers in creating the hive. A matron can be unseated only by another female that defeats her in a duel to the death.": "沙丘收割者战士总是雌性的，统治着较小的无人机和嘶吼者，这些人都是雄性。每个战士与多个无人机和嘶吼者组成一个狩猎群，作为伴侣；如果她被杀，其他收割者会变得不稳定。一个战士的配偶在力量上与她密切相关，以确保只有最强壮的收割者才会繁殖。蜂群中占主导地位的雌性，被称为母皇，做出所有决定，引导蜂群进入新的领域，并指导追随者创建蜂巢。只有在生死决斗中打败她的另一只雌性，才能解除母皇的地位。",
	"Dune reapers are extremely dangerous during their annual mating season, when they hunt for prey to feed growing young. The pack's matron lays eggs in the bodies of living creatures. When the eggs hatch, the young reapers devour the helpless captives. The stronger hatchlings then set upon their brood mates, killing and eating the weak ones. Young reapers that survive are driven from the hive after about two months and must either join another pride or form a new one. These juveniles are as deadly as adults.": "沙丘收割者在每年的交配季节是非常危险的，他们会猎取猎物来喂养成长中的孩子。群体的母体将卵产在生物的体内。当蛋孵化时，年轻的收割者会吞噬无助的俘虏。更强壮的幼崽会向它们的兄弟姐妹下手，杀死并吃掉弱小者。活下来的年轻收割者在大约两个月后被赶出蜂巢，必须加入另一个蜂群或组建一个新的蜂群。这些幼虫和成年虫一样致命。",

Its head is triangular, and the neck attaches near the top of the head, causing its leering, toothy face and pointed chin to hang below its shoulders. The dune stalker's gangly body is hairless, and its red, dusty, abrasive skin has no pores. The combination of short legs, long arms, and stooped posture causes its hands to drag on the ground. Its fingers and toes (four on each limb) are long and bony. The creature has massive shoulders and an enormous chest, which tapers to a narrow waist and hips. A dune stalker that has been assigned a mission by its summoner pursues the literal fulfillment of its instructions to the exclusion of all else. It resents its time on the Material Plane and wants to make its stay there as short as possible. Occasionally, a summoner's instructions are phrased in such a way that the dune stalker cannot actually carry them out.

	"A dune stalker's preferred tactic is to hide in a rocky area and attack from ambush. When possible, it tries to gain higher ground on its opponents by climbing up on a rock or a structure to conceal itself. It often begins an assault by using its shout ability to disorient a group of opponents, then leaping into combat to deliver its kiss of death. Against foes within its reach, a dune stalker usually prefers to deliver a kiss of death against just one target rather than a shout against the whole group. The preferred target is the one it seeks to slay, or the one that presents the greatest danger, or the one that appears to have the strongest good alignment.

	"A weird can divine information that could change the very course of history. It has its finger on the pulse of fate and knows exactly where possible courses of action might lead. Like most seers, an elemental weird never provides a clear, concise prophecy.

	"All weirds, regardless of their elemental subtypes, are connected to each other in fundamental ways. They share a unique, secret bond that is evidenced in their level of cooperation. A weird that cannot provide the desired knowledge to a supplicant usually guides him or her to another weird for better counsel. Weirds of different elements often place their pools close to one another to broaden the range of divination services available to supplicants in an area.

	"Elemental Pool": "元素池",
	"Each weird dwells within a large pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird must provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Air Pool. An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).": "每个怪人都住在一个大池子里（至少20英尺宽，40英尺深），里面充满了最纯粹的元素。池子总是被固定在一个平面上（地板、墙壁或天花板；可能的方向见个别条目），这样它的深度在该表面上形成一个空洞。该表面必须有足够的深度来容纳水池。一个元素池也可以作为同一元素的更大体积内的一个独立区域存在；例如，一个水怪的池子可能位于海洋或湖泊的底部。池子的底部有一个通往该怪人的本位面的入口。被怪人准许进入池子的生物必须提供自己的保护，使其不受元素物质的影响，并提供在该环境中呼吸和移动的方法。否则，他们就会受到个别条目中给出的影响。一个怪人在身体上被束缚在它的池子里，除了通过传送门回到它的本位面外，不能离开。怪人可以上升到离水池表面10英尺的高度，但其身体的下半部分必须始终与元素物质保持接触。一旦怪人离开池子回到它的本位面，传送门就会关闭，池子就会失去它的特殊效果。空气池。一个空气怪兽的池子里充满了波涛汹涌的、可呼吸的空气和雾气的蒸汽。没有飞行能力的生物无法在其中移动，除非是坠落。空气怪人的池子可以贴在任何垂直或水平的表面上，它可以朝上或朝下（例如，如果贴在天花板上）。火池。这个池子里有一股跳舞的火焰，不断地燃烧和冒烟。在火池中没有保护的易燃物会立即着火，在火池中的任何生物每回合都会受到3d10的火焰伤害。没有飞行能力的生物不能在这个池子里移动，除非是坠落。一个火怪的池子可以贴在任何垂直或水平的表面上，而且它只能以右面朝上的姿势出现（比如在洞穴的地板上）。土池。这个池子里充满了搅动的泥浆、岩石和土。每个在其中的生物（除了土怪和土元素）每回合都会从不断碾压的泥土中受到4d8的打击伤害。此外，进入池子的生物如果没有办法呼吸就会窒息，如果不能钻洞就会被禁锢（限制）。土怪的池子只能贴在水平面上，而且只能出现在右侧的位置（例如在洞穴的地板上）。水池。这个水池充满了冒泡的、旋转的水。任何在其中不能呼吸水的生物都会立即开始淹死。任何没有游泳能力的生物都无法在水潭中移动，除非是掉下去。一个水怪的池子只能贴在一个水平的表面上，而且它只能出现在一个右侧的位置上（比如在洞穴的地板上）。",
