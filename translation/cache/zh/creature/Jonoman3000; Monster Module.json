	"The poison of a greater basilisk can be delivered through its bite, as well as through the two prongs at the end of its tail. It can also spit its poison a considerable distance, covering a creature and splashing the surrounding area. As deadly as these creatures are, this venom is often sought after by hunters and adventurers for its use in poisons and alchemical compounds.": "大玄武岩的毒药可以通过它的咬合，以及通过它尾巴末端的两根刺来传递。它还可以将毒液吐出相当远的距离，覆盖一个生物并溅到周围的区域。尽管这些生物是致命的，但这种毒液经常被猎人和冒险家追捧，因为它可以用于制作毒药和炼金化合物。",
	"Greater basilisks usually make their lairs in coastal caves, from which they patrol the surrounding area for potential meals. Far more intelligent than its cousins, greater basilisks often \"tame\" lesser basilisks, using them as guards for their lairs in exchange for protection and food.": "大罗汉通常在沿海的洞穴中筑巢，并在周围地区巡逻，寻找潜在的食物。大罗汉比它的亲戚聪明得多，它们经常 \"驯服 \"小罗汉，用它们作为巢穴的守卫，以换取保护和食物。",
	"A greater basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained, but doing so is a far harder task than training a regular basilisk. However, a properly trained greater basilisk is one of the most effective guardians around, so their eggs go for exorbitant prices.": "人工饲养的大玄武岩可以被驯化和训练，但这样做比训练普通玄武岩要难得多。然而，训练有素的大玄武岩是周围最有效的守护者之一，所以它们的蛋价格不菲。",
	"A greater basilisk's supernatural gaze is able to turn creatures to stone instantaneously. Then they consume their meals in much the same way a regular basilisk does, except they are able to hunt much larger prey. It is not uncommon to find a stone statue of a huge beast near the lair of a greater basilisk.": "大玄武岩的超自然目光能够瞬间将生物变成石头。然后它们以与普通玄武岩相同的方式进食，只是它们能够猎取更大的猎物。在大玄武岩的巢穴附近发现一个巨大的野兽石像是很常见的事。",

	"Bright blue in color and monstrous in its demeanor, a marine basilisk is a rare variation of the ground-dwelling basilisk. Adapted to the environment of the great oceans and lakes of the world, these creatures are skilled swimmers and are surprisingly quiet in the water. Their bodies are large and streamlined, like the body of a crocodile.": "海洋玄武岩的颜色鲜蓝，举止怪异，是地面居住的玄武岩的罕见变种。为了适应世界大海洋和湖泊的环境，这些生物是熟练的游泳者，在水中出奇的安静。它们的身体很大，呈流线型，就像鳄鱼的身体一样。",
	"A marine basilisk has petrifying enzymes within its stomach that it can release after inhaling a large amount of water.

This is especially useful for marine basilisks that hunt in the deep sea, as many creatures there are naturally blind.": "海洋玄武岩在其胃内有石化酶，在吸入大量的水后可以释放。这种致命的混合物能够使它所接触到的任何生物石化，使海洋玄武岩能够猎取不看它的猎物。这对在深海中捕猎的海洋玄武岩特别有用，因为那里的许多生物是天生的盲人。",
	"As marine basilisks almost exclusively hunt underwater, they don't have the same warning signs that terrestrial basilisks have. Most of their prey is small enough to be eaten whole after the petrification process, and the creatures that aren't just sink to the bottom of whatever body of water the basilisk hunts in, making it hard to see the typical warning signs of a basilisk.": "由于海洋玄武岩几乎只在水下捕猎，它们没有陆生玄武岩那样的警告标志。它们的大部分猎物都足够小，在石化过程后可以被整个吃掉，而那些没有被吃掉的生物则会沉入巴斯里斯克捕猎的水体底部，因此很难看到巴斯里斯克的典型警告标志。",
	"Behirs are powerful cavern predators, known for their long, snake-like bodies and their deadly lightning breath. Some behirs have gained certain mutations, making them stronger, or weaker, than their kin.": "贝赫人是强大的洞穴掠夺者，以其长长的蛇形身体和致命的闪电气息而闻名。一些贝赫人获得了某些变异，使他们比其亲属更强或更弱。",
	"A plated behir is a genetic mutation that is results in larger, thicker scales across its body, like a personalized coat of pale blue plating. These creatures are more slender than their kin, and their hard plating makes their gullet less flexible than that of a normal behir. These variations mean that they are incapable of safely swallowing large prey whole, forcing them to use other methods of taking down their foes.": "电镀贝希尔是一种基因突变，其结果是全身的鳞片更大、更厚，就像一件个性化的淡蓝色镀层。这些生物比它们的亲属更苗条，而它们坚硬的镀层使它们的咽喉比正常的behir更不灵活。这些变化意味着它们无法安全地将大型猎物整个吞下，迫使它们使用其他方法来击倒敌人。",
	"Plated behirs are more proficient in their lightning-based abilities, which they can manipulate to create alternate effects to the basic lightning breath that behirs are known for. These creatures can also charge their metallic plating with electricity, making themselves momentarily stronger and faster after they attack with their lightning.": "镀金的behirs更精通他们基于闪电的能力，他们可以操纵这些能力来创造behirs所熟知的基本闪电呼吸之外的其他效果。这些生物还可以给自己的金属镀层充电，使自己在用闪电攻击后瞬间变得更加强大和快速。",
	"Plated behirs are often shunned by other behir, and they often never find a mate unless they are lucky enough to come across another of their kind. Their dragon-like appearance makes other behir wary of their presence, and some may even go as far as hunting them down.": "镀金的贝里尔经常被其他贝里尔回避，除非他们足够幸运地遇到另一个同类，否则他们往往找不到伴侣。他们像龙一样的外表使其他behir对他们的存在保持警惕，有些人甚至会去追杀他们。",
	"The plates of a plated behir are a valued commodity, due their their applications in armor making. Adventurers that think they're powerful enough to take one down will often go to great lengths to secure its hide, which can be sold for high prices or forged into lightning-resistant plate armor.": "电镀贝希尔的板块是一种有价值的商品，因为它们可以用于制造盔甲。那些认为自己足够强大到可以打倒它的冒险者往往会不遗余力地保护它的皮毛，这些皮毛可以卖出高价或被锻造成抗雷的板甲。",
	"An eye of the deep is a lesser beholder that might come into being when a beholder has a nightmare of drowning in the depths of the ocean.

	"An eye of the deep terrorizes whatever body of water it ends up in, destroying and consuming the natural wildlife and harassing any seaside settlements that are unfortunate enough to be near it. While it mostly remains underwater, terrorizing ships and other vessels, an eye of the deep often ventures onto the shore for short periods of time in order to find new victims.": "深海之眼恐吓它所处的任何水域，破坏和吞噬自然界的野生动物，骚扰任何不幸靠近它的海边居民。虽然它大部分时间都呆在水下，恐吓船只和其他船舶，但深海之眼经常在短时间内冒险上岸，以寻找新的受害者。",
	"The central eye of the eye of the deep emits a glaringly bright magical light that can light up even magical darkness. This light can be used to attract the prey that instinctively swim towards it, to their own demise. A creature that comes too close to this light becomes temporarily blinded by its brightness. It is at this point that the eye of the deep attacks unleashing its claws and eye rays upon its unfortunate victim.": "深海之眼的中心眼发出刺眼的魔光，甚至可以照亮魔法黑暗。这种光可以用来吸引那些本能地游向它的猎物，使它们自取灭亡。太靠近这种光的生物会因其亮度而暂时失明。就在这时，深海之眼发动攻击，将它的爪子和眼睛的光线释放到不幸的受害者身上。",
	"Appearing as a mass of dead branches and thorny brambles, a bramble blight is a particularly potent version of the blight. Capable of speech, these blights act as warriors and pseudo-leaders to the other blights. Unlike others of their kind, a bramble blight creates weapons that it imbues with the deadly poison that courses throughout its body.": "荆棘枯萎病是一种特别强大的枯萎病，表现为大量的枯枝和多刺的荆棘。这些枯萎病患者能够说话，是其他枯萎病患者的战士和伪领袖。与其他同类不同的是，荆条菌创造的武器被它注入了致命的毒药，这些毒药流遍了整个身体。",

The creatures that get this close are soon met with the blind rage of the wood blight.": "高大的两足动物，在昏暗的光线下，木枯病人可能会被误认为是一个人类旅行者。仔细观察，它们覆盖着树皮的木质外形就会变得很明显。如此接近的生物很快就会遇到木枯病人的盲目愤怒。",
	"Highly trained and extremely capable, a bugbear assassin is a force to be reckoned with. While all bugbears are naturally stealthy, these individuals have honed that ability to become some of the most sought after assassins, especially among the other goblinoid races. Often found under the employment of a troop of hobgoblins, a bugbear assassin is able to dispatch even some of the most powerful foes they might encounter.": "训练有素、能力超强的虫族刺客是一股不可小觑的力量。虽然所有的虫族都是天生的隐身者，但这些人已经磨练了这种能力，成为一些最受欢迎的刺客，特别是在其他的地精种族中。虫族刺客通常受雇于一支地精部队，他们甚至能够消灭他们可能遇到的最强大的敌人。",

A bugbear assassin often asks for large payments to be made up front for it to even consider taking a job, and they are quick to betray their allies if a better offer presents itself.": "然而，这种有效性是有代价的。虫族刺客经常要求预先支付大笔款项，以便考虑接受一项工作，而且如果有更好的条件出现，他们会很快背叛他们的盟友。",
	"A bugbear champion of Hruggek has been blessed by that feared god of war, gifted with great strength and the ability to cast divine magic. These champions act as war priests, marching into the front lines to both wreak havoc and protect their allies from harm. They often take on more of a supportive role than their allies, using spells like hold person and spiritual weapon to control the battle.": "Hruggek的虫族冠军得到了那位令人敬畏的战神的祝福，被赋予了强大的力量和施展神圣魔法的能力。这些冠军扮演着战争祭司的角色，进入前线进行破坏并保护他们的盟友免受伤害。他们往往比他们的盟友承担更多的支持性角色，使用像牵制人和精神武器这样的法术来控制战局。",
	"The highest member in the aristocracy, a bullywug chief has fought hard and long to rise to its position of relative splendor.

	"When a succubus and a male human procreate, the result of this pairing is occasionally an alu-fiend, an always female cambion that takes more after its non-fiendish parent than most cambions. Outside of their large, leathery wings, these creatures look almost entirely human. They lack the discolored skin, tails, and horns that identify most cambions, allowing them to pass themselves off as normal humans if they find a way to hide their wings.": "当一个魅魔和一个男性人类生育时，这种配对的结果偶尔会出现一个Alu-fiend，一种总是女性的cambion，比大多数cambion更像它的非亲生父母。除了他们巨大的皮革翅膀之外，这些生物看起来几乎完全是人类。他们没有变色的皮肤、尾巴和角，而这些都是大多数cambions的特征，如果他们找到一种方法来隐藏他们的翅膀，就可以把自己当作正常人。",
	"Alu-fiends are usually raised by their mothers, and end up just as evil as their fiendish parent.

	"Cambions, as the general term for a half-fiend, encompass a variety of possible pairings. These pairings, dependent mostly on the fiendish parent, can produce offspring that end up quite different from the more general cambion. Cambions sired from greater beings, like arch-devils and arch-demons, might end up overwhelmingly powerful once they come of age. Those sired by weaker fiends, however, could end up relatively weak, and in rare cases, might be able to resist the evil nature of their fiendish parents.": "坎贝尔，作为半成品的总称，包含了各种可能的配对。这些配对，主要取决于恶魔的父母，可以产生出与更一般的坎贝尔完全不同的后代。由更大的生命，如大恶魔和大恶魔所生的坎贝尔，一旦成年，可能最终会有压倒性的力量。然而，那些由较弱的恶魔所生的孩子，最终可能会变得相对较弱，在极少数情况下，可能会抵制他们恶魔般的父母的邪恶本质。",

	"Tangle crawlers use their improved camouflage and other adaptations to their forested habitat to better ambush their victims, paralyzing them and pulling them to their death. Despite their great size, a tangle crawler can easily conceal itself within the piles of leaves and loose dirt that cover the forest floor.

	"Once its mission is complete, a cerynitis lives out the rest of its fairly short lifespan, usually less than a decade, still seeking to help the good hearted and destroy the evils of the world.": "一旦它的任务完成，cerynitis就会度过它剩下的相当短的寿命，通常不到十年，仍然寻求帮助心地善良的人并摧毁世界的邪恶。",
	"To onlookers, the passage of a cerynitis looks like nothing more than a blur of golden light. Near uncatchable, a cerynitis is at its best in open plains and sparse forests, where it can travel across vast distances to reach the things it needs to protect or the enemies it must vanquish. It is this unparalleled speed that makes a cerynitis a powerful mount, though they are only willing to carry noble humanoids.": "在旁观者看来，Cerynitis的通道看起来不过是一道模糊的金光。cerynitis在开阔的平原和稀疏的森林中几乎是无法捕捉的，在那里它可以穿越遥远的距离，到达它需要保护的东西或它必须战胜的敌人。正是这种无与伦比的速度，使cerynitis成为强大的坐骑，尽管它们只愿意携带高贵的人类。",
	"A cerynitis' antlers are made from both bone and gold, making them highly prized and sought after. A set of antlers can often sell for 2,500 gp or more.": "犀牛的鹿角是由骨头和黄金制成的，因此它们非常珍贵，受到追捧。一套鹿角通常可以卖到2500金币或更多。",
	"Astral chimeras are the antithesis of Demogorgon's creations, brought into existence through the powers of ancient, goodaligned deities. An ordinary specimen resembles a large silver-furred beast, with blue skin, the forelimbs of a bird, and the hindquarters of a goat. Upon its shoulders sit two necks and two heads, one more feline and the other more canine.": "星际嵌合体是德摩根的对立面，通过古代善神的力量而产生的。一个普通的标本类似于一个巨大的银色毛发的野兽，有蓝色的皮肤，有鸟的前肢，有山羊的后肢。它的肩膀上有两个脖子和两个头，一个更像猫科动物，另一个更像犬科动物。",
	"Within the great, silvery seas of the astral plane float the petrified remains of dead gods, set adrift for millennia after their passing. While these beings are long deceased, some small remnants of their power still seep into the world. Occasionally, these remnants of power can combine with magic inherent to the astral plane, forming the creatures known as astral chimeras.": "在星界巨大的、银色的海洋中，漂浮着死去的神灵的石化遗体，在他们去世后漂浮了数千年。虽然这些生命早已逝去，但他们的力量的一些小残余仍然渗入世界。偶尔，这些残余的力量可以与星界固有的魔法结合，形成被称为星界嵌合体的生物。",
	"While these creatures are born in isolation, they do not stay in reclusion for long. Driven by their innate good nature, astral chimeras seek to travel through all planes of existence, vanquishing evil where they find it and assisting other creatures in their time of need.": "虽然这些生物生来就与世隔绝，但它们不会在封闭状态下呆很久。在与生俱来的善良本性的驱使下，星际嵌合体寻求穿越所有的存在平面，在他们发现的地方消灭邪恶，并在其他生物需要的时候帮助他们。",
	"Astral chimeras are constantly moving from place to place, using their innate ability to planeshift and jaunt to and from the astral plane to make their way across the multiverse. In their travels, astral chimeras can gain a breadth of knowledge that few creatures can match.": "星际嵌合体不断地从一个地方移动到另一个地方，利用他们与生俱来的平面移动能力和往返于星界的能力，在多元宇宙中前进。在他们的旅行中，星际嵌合体可以获得很少有生物可以比拟的广泛的知识。",
	"When Demogorgon birthed chimeras into the material plane, demimaeras, also referred to as lesser chimeras, were also created. Lacking the draconic head and leathery wings of true chimeras, demimaeras instead have an alternate third head - a snake head on the end of their tail.": "当Demogorgon将嵌合体孕育到物质界时，demimaeras，也被称为小嵌合体，也被创造出来。由于缺乏真正的奇美拉的头部和皮革翅膀，奇美拉有一个备用的第三个头--尾巴末端的蛇头。",
	"A demimaera's personality, like the typical chimera, is shaped by the worst aspects of its three parts. It has the same leonine territoriality and goat-like stubbornness, but it lacks the draconic greediness of typical chimeras that lead them to seek out hoards of gold and jewels. Instead, its snake head gives it a vengeful, vindictive streak that causes it to go to great lengths to kill those that it believes have wronged it. Creatures that steal a demimaera's food or manage to wound it and escape are tracked down and brought to a grisly end.": "像典型的奇美拉一样，迪米拉的个性是由其三个部分中最糟糕的方面形成的。它有同样的利安人的领地意识和山羊般的固执，但它缺乏典型的奇美拉的贪婪，导致它们寻找大量的黄金和珠宝。相反，它的蛇头给了它一种复仇的、报复性的倾向，使它不惜一切代价去杀死那些它认为对它不利的人。那些偷吃Demimaera的食物或设法打伤它并逃跑的生物都会被追踪并遭到可怕的结局。",
	"A maeragorgon is a chimera that Demogorgon has personally corrupted with abyssal magic, transforming it into a fiendish creature far crueler than any normal chimera. Stronger and more cunning than their lesser counterparts, maeragorgons serve directly under the Prince of Demons, and their power is comparable to that of type 5 or type 6 demons. Maeragorgons unquestioningly exercise the demon prince's will, serving as powerful guards or war beasts whenever the need arises.": "马勒戈壁是德摩根亲自用深渊魔法改造的奇美拉，将其改造成比普通奇美拉更残酷的恶魔生物。马勒戈壁比它们较小的同类更强大、更狡猾，它们直接在恶魔王子手下服务，其力量可与5型或6型恶魔相媲美。麦拉格龙毫不犹豫地行使恶魔王子的意志，在需要时充当强大的护卫或战争野兽。",
	"Through their transformation maeragorgons are gifted with fiendish abilities. They can cause their claws to leave trails of flame, their horns to coat with ice, and their fanged maw to secrete a deadly poison. A maeragorgon uses these gifts to become an unpredictable opponent that can change up its tactics on a whim. In combat, maeragorgons stay constantly mobile, landing to quickly take out a foe and then lifting back into the sky with a burst of flame. More intelligent than lesser chimeras, a maeragorgon will use its speed and powerful breath attack to keep itself out of harm's way, and knows when retreat is necessary.": "通过他们的转变，巨魔被赋予了魔鬼般的能力。他们可以让自己的爪子留下火焰的痕迹，让自己的角披上冰的外衣，让自己的獠牙大嘴分泌出致命的毒药。蛇妖利用这些天赋成为一个不可预测的对手，可以随心所欲地改变其战术。在战斗中，麦拉格龙保持着持续的机动性，落地后迅速干掉一个敌人，然后带着一阵火焰升回天空。比起较小的奇美拉，麦拉格龙更聪明，它会利用它的速度和强大的呼吸攻击来保持自己不受伤害，并知道什么时候撤退是必要的。",
	"A maeragorgon can serve as an exceptionally powerful mount, carrying upon its back high-ranking demons, death knights, and other vile creatures.": "麦拉格龙可以作为一个特别强大的坐骑，在它的背上驮着高级恶魔、死亡骑士和其他邪恶的生物。",
	"Although this blood-sucking carnivore is most well-known for its hunting of goats, sheep, and other farm animals, it preys on any creature that it is capable of killing. The victims of a chupacabra are sucked dry of their blood, all with three puncture wounds centered around a point on their chest or neck. When such victims are found on the edges of civilization, there is little that untrained, unprotected villagers can do to protect themselves or their livestock from such vicious monsters.": "虽然这种吸血的食肉动物因猎杀山羊、绵羊和其他农场动物而最为出名，但它也会捕食任何它有能力杀死的生物。楚帕卡布拉的受害者被吸干了血，都是以胸口或脖子上的一个点为中心的三个穿刺伤。当这种受害者在文明的边缘被发现时，没有受过训练、没有保护的村民几乎无法保护自己或他们的牲畜不受这种凶恶怪物的伤害。",
	"A chupacabra spends the daylight hours asleep, hidden in its swampy lair. Small prey—drained of blood—may be found in these lairs as evidence of their inhabitants, but its lair is otherwise indistinguishable from the hidey hole of a common beast. It is only at nightfall that these monstrous creatures awaken, ready to hunt for their next meal. Quiet on its feet, a chupacabra stalks the outskirts of a village, waiting for a suitable meal to show itself. Once the opportunity arises, a chupacabra darts out from its hiding place, ambushing its prey before they can react. When it completes its kill, it vanishes into the night as quickly as it came.": "楚帕卡布拉在白天的时候都在睡觉，藏在它的沼泽地里。在这些巢穴中可能会发现一些被吸干血的小猎物，作为其居民的证据，但它的巢穴在其他方面与普通野兽的藏身处没有区别。只有在夜幕降临时，这些可怕的生物才会醒来，准备猎取它们的下一餐。卓柏卡布拉在村子的外围徘徊，等待着合适的食物出现。一旦有机会，秋刀鱼就会从藏身处飞奔出来，在猎物反应过来之前埋伏在他们身边。当它完成杀戮后，就像它来时一样迅速消失在黑夜中。",
	"While a chupacabra's taste for blood is commonly known among adventurers, lesser known are the magical effects fresh blood has on a chupacabra's body. As long as a chupacabra is able to suck the blood of a creature, it can close its wounds and greatly increase its stamina. Those that fight a chupacabra are often surprised by its increased speed and durability in combat.": "虽然秋刀鱼对血的口味在冒险家中是众所周知的，但鲜血对秋刀鱼身体的神奇影响却鲜为人知。只要楚柏卡布拉能够吸食生物的血液，它就能封闭伤口并大大增加其体力。那些与楚柏卡布拉战斗的人往往对它在战斗中增加的速度和耐久性感到惊讶。",
	"The brass spider is one of the larger gnomish creations, built for its offensive power and mobility. Although commonly called a spider, the contraption only has six legs, rather than eight. However, its brass body and head resembles that of a large spider, with decorative \"fangs\" and a protruding abdomen. Each of its six legs are made from sharpened, iron blades. These blades serve as effective weapons, and also allow the construct to climb near-vertical surfaces, forcibly stabbing its legs into a wall for grip.": "铜蜘蛛是较大的地精创造物之一，因其攻击力和机动性而建造。虽然通常被称为蜘蛛，但这个装置只有六条腿，而不是八条。然而，它的铜制身体和头部与大蜘蛛很相似，有装饰性的 \"獠牙 \"和突出的腹部。它的六条腿都是由削尖的铁片制成。这些刀片可以作为有效的武器，也可以让这个构造物爬上近乎垂直的表面，强行将它的腿刺入墙壁以获得抓力。",
	"In combat, a brass spider is well suited to taking on multiple opponents, making it especially useful in a large-scale conflict. The raw power within its legs allows its to jump into the fray, knocking down and skewering multiple opponents at once. A brass spider that manages to knock down an opponent can keep that creature in place, stabbing a leg through the creature's body or clothes straight into the ground beneath them.": "在战斗中，黄铜蜘蛛很适合对付多个对手，使它在大规模冲突中特别有用。它腿上的原始力量使它能够跳入战场，一次击倒并串联多个对手。成功击倒对手的黄铜蜘蛛可以将该生物留在原地，将腿穿过该生物的身体或衣服直接刺入他们脚下的地面。",
	"Gnomish advances in mechanical and magical design have led to the creation of many unique clockwork contraptions. Some of these designs have become staples among Gnomish crafters, while others have faded into obscurity.": "地精在机械和魔法设计方面的进步，导致了许多独特的钟表装置的诞生。其中一些设计已经成为地精工匠们的主打产品，而另一些则已经淡出了人们的视线。",

	"The man-eating greater cockatrice is a creature of unnatural origin. Produced from the egg of a common cockatrice that is subsequently incubated in the belly of a giant toad, a greater cockatrice can grow to sizes far larger than a man. Ferocious and untamable, greater cockatrices are only rarely born. As the strange circumstances that lead to their hatching are hardly natural, these creatures are only born through the will of other creatures.

	"Some superstitions claim that a cockatrice can kill with its gaze alone. A seasoned adventurer knows this to be a myth, but myths often hold grains of truth.

	"The curious, scuttling crysmal resembles a scorpion built from colorful gemstones. Native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, crysmals search the winding caverns of that plane for gems and valuable stones.

Over time, this species has been twisted so far from normal cyclopes as to be completely unrecognizable, save for their singular, bright red eye.": "地狱独眼巨人是阿斯莫德的爪牙，被创造出来以促进大恶魔在物质世界的目标。这些生物被赋予了恶魔般的残忍和地狱般的能力，它们最初是在几千年前被创造出来的，从普通的独眼巨人被扭曲成可怕的、畸形的形状。虽然大多数经历了这种转变的剑水蚤在这个过程中死亡，但少数幸存下来的剑水蚤被赋予了力量，甚至可以与世界上最强大的巨人相媲美。随着时间的推移，这个物种已经从正常的独眼巨人扭曲到完全无法辨认，只剩下他们唯一的、鲜红的眼睛。",
	"In battle, an infernal cyclops wields both a giant-sized club as well as a long whip imbued with hellfire, which it uses to great effect. With a shrill, uncharacteristic shriek, the creature can stop foes in their tracks. But its most dangerous weapon is its eye—with a look, an infernal cyclops can unleash a ray of hellfire that annihilates whatever it strikes.": "在战斗中，地狱独眼巨人同时挥舞着一根巨大的棍子和一条浸透了地狱之火的长鞭，它使用这些棍子的效果非常好。随着一声尖锐的、非同寻常的尖叫，这种生物可以让敌人停下脚步。但它最危险的武器是它的眼睛，只要看一眼，地狱独眼巨人就能释放出一束地狱之火，消灭它所攻击的东西。",
	"The infernal cyclops is meant to be used in an environment with ample amounts of cover. The cyclops' eye ray deals a considerable amount of damage, but its delay means that players have the opportunity to duck behind cover before the ray fires. As the ray always fires at the start of the cyclops' turn, before the cyclops has a chance to move to a better firing position, mobile players can avoid ever taking a hit. The only time a highly mobile player, like a rogue, should be at risk of being hit by the eye ray is after being stunned by the cyclops' shriek, or after being immobilized in some other way.": "地狱独眼巨人是为了在有大量掩体的环境中使用。剑水蚤的眼睛射线会造成相当大的伤害，但它的延迟意味着玩家有机会在射线发射前躲到掩体后面。由于射线总是在独眼巨人的回合开始时发射，在独眼巨人有机会移动到一个更好的射击位置之前，移动玩家可以避免被击中。唯一一个高度机动的玩家，比如流氓，应该有被眼睛射线击中的风险，那就是在被剑水蚤的尖叫声震晕之后，或者在以其他方式被固定住之后。",
	"Also consider making much of the available cover destructible, so that the eye ray becomes harder to avoid as the fight progresses and cover becomes more scarce.": "还可以考虑让大部分可用的掩护物变得可破坏，这样随着战斗的进行和掩护物变得越来越少，眼射线就更难避免了。",
	"Lastly, keep in mind that the players can choose to intentionally fail the save, allowing them to protect allies that can't make it into cover in time (such as players stunned by the cyclops' shriek).": "最后，请记住，玩家可以选择故意不救人，让他们保护那些不能及时进入掩体的盟友（比如被独眼巨人的尖叫声震晕的玩家）。",
	"A so-called primal cyclops is actually a completely unrelated species of giant to the normal cyclops, but their shared characteristic of a single eye makes these two creatures often confused. A primal cyclops is part giant, part elemental, as rock-like armored plates sprout from its arms and backside. Its hands are overly large, even considering its colossal stature, and its fingers are ended by sharp, stone-like claws.": "所谓的原始剑水蚤实际上是一种与普通剑水蚤完全无关的巨人物种，但它们共同的特征是有一只眼睛，这使得这两种生物经常被混淆。原始剑水蚤部分是巨人，部分是元素，因为岩石般的装甲板从它的手臂和背上长出来。即使考虑到它巨大的身材，它的手也是过大的，而且它的手指末端有锋利的、像石头一样的爪子。",
	"A primal cyclops lives alone, far from other members of it kind and even farther from anything that could be called civilization. For most of their lives, a primal cyclops lives only with the animals that it keeps, which include both farm animals like sheep and cows, as well as hunting animals like dire wolves. Primal cyclopes are known to get quite attached to some of the animals they hunt with, and won't hesitate to kill any creature that harms or kills one of its hunting companions.": "原始剑水蚤独自生活，远离其他同类，甚至远离任何可以被称为文明的东西。在他们生活的大部分时间里，原始剑水蚤只和它所饲养的动物生活在一起，其中包括像绵羊和奶牛这样的农场动物，也包括像可怕的狼这样的狩猎动物。众所周知，原始剑水蚤对一些与它们一起狩猎的动物很有感情，并且会毫不犹豫地杀死任何伤害或杀死其狩猎同伴的生物。",
	"The only time a primal cyclops seeks out another one of its kind is when it wishes to mate. When the time is right, a primal cyclops sets out across the wilderness to find a mate. Mating between these creatures is a loveless affair, and they raise their young only the minimum amount necessary before releasing them to fend for their own.": "原始独眼巨人只有在希望交配时才会寻找另一个同类。当时机成熟时，原始剑水蚤就会穿越荒野去寻找配偶。这些生物之间的交配是一种无爱的事情，它们只养育最小的孩子，然后再把它们释放出来，让它们自己照顾自己。",
	"Primal cyclopes have a keen sense of smell, especially when it comes to the scent of blood. While their eyesight is poor, like other cyclops, their sense of smell makes up for it. Primal cyclopes can track down wounded creatures for miles, and can pinpoint the exact location of nearby bleeding creatures, even if they have no way to see them.": "原始独眼巨人有敏锐的嗅觉，特别是当涉及到血的气味时。虽然他们的视力很差，就像其他独眼巨人一样，但他们的嗅觉却能弥补这一缺陷。原始独眼巨人可以追踪数英里外的受伤生物，并能确定附近出血生物的确切位置，即使他们没有办法看到它们。",
	"After spending the casting time writing magical runes and symbols along the inanimate form of the construct, you create an animated construct with a challenge rating of 1 or less that cannot cast spells. This spell can target any non-animated object that can be animated, such as a weapon, armor, or the base of a homunculus (the DM has the creature's statistics). When you cast the spell, you give the construct a basic command that it follows for the duration of its existence, such as \"guard this area\" or \"protect me.\"": "在花费施法时间沿着构筑物的无生命形态书写魔法符文和符号后，你会创造出一个挑战等级为1或更低的不能施法的动画构筑物。这个法术可以针对任何可以被动画化的非动画物体，例如武器、盔甲或同形体的底座（DM有该生物的统计数据）。当你施法时，你会给这个构造物一个基本的命令，它在存在的期间内都会遵循这个命令，比如说 \"守护这个区域 \"或 \"保护我\"。",
	"If the construct is ever reduced to 0 hit points, you must spend half of its material cost to repair it. Otherwise, it can be repaired with {@spell mending} over the duration of a long rest.": "如果该建筑被降低到 0 点，你必须花费其材料成本的一半来修复它。否则，它可以在长期休息的时间内以（%0%）的代价修复。",
	"When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you can animate an object with a higher challenge rating: 2 with a 5th-level slot, 3 with a 7th-level slot, and 4 with a 9th-level slot.": "当你使用某些更高级别的法术槽施展这个法术时，你可以使一个具有更高的挑战等级的物体成为活物：使用第五级法术槽时为2，使用第七级法术槽时为3，使用第九级法术槽时为4。"
