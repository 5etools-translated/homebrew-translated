	"{@b {@i Beware the Bagman.}} Some say \"The Bagman\" is merely an urban legend. One version of the story tells of an adventurer who sought to escape certain death by abandoning his companions and hiding inside a bag of holding. Later, when he tried to leave the bag, he became lost amid a constantly increasing number of extra dimensional storage spaces. Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, The Bagman slips out from a random bag of holding. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk. Some say that if you speak too loudly over an open bag of holding or whisper \"follow my voice\" into a magical storage space, space three times, The Bagman will come for you. Whether this is the true genesis of the bagman or not, the fact remains that a bagman is a very real threat, and a fate worse than death awaits those dragged into the realm from which they hail.": "{@b {@i Beware the Bagman.}}有人说 \"袋子人 \"只是一个城市传说。这个故事的一个版本讲述了一个冒险家为了逃避死亡，抛弃了他的同伴，躲进了一个储物袋。后来，当他试图离开这个袋子时，他在不断增加的超维存储空间中迷失了方向。随着时间的推移，这个神奇的中间地带的奇怪力量把这个冒险家变成了一个畸形的生物。现在，每天晚上，袋人都会从一个随机的储物袋中溜出来。如果他没有找到自己的家，他就会把某个人拖回袋子里，并从他隐藏的失落的垃圾王国中留下一些小玩意。有人说，如果你在一个打开的储物袋上说话太大声，或者对着一个神奇的储物空间小声说 \"跟着我的声音走\"，空间三次，袋人就会来找你。无论这是否是袋子人的真正起源，事实是袋子人是一个非常真实的威胁，比死亡更糟糕的命运在等待着那些被拖入他们所来自的领域。",
	"{@b {@i \"Men\", Not \"Man\".}} The myth of The Bagman would suggest that there is only one \"Bagman\", however, the reality is much more sinister. When a bagman comes through a bag of holding into the material world, it does so in an attempt to find its way back to wherever it originally came from. When it is unsuccessful in finding its home, the creature always attempts to drag another sentient creature back with it into the bizarre realm it calls home, the \"Space Between Spaces\". If its kidnapping attempt is successful, it will typically abandon the creature before long as it continues its quest to find a way back home. Creatures who don't make it back to the material world will find themselves slowly twisted into a new bagman, destined to the same nightly ritual of obsessively trying to find their way back to where they came from. Why bagmen kidnap creatures is a mystery. Some scholars posit that it is a twisted reflex. That maybe they recognize their own perverse nature and a part of them hopes to be delivered from their predicament by somebody with their mind still intact. Others believe they do so at the behest of a dark entity, an unknown evil that is responsible for the creation of the first bagman who uses them as a means to gather twisted subordinates for some scheme that is yet to be revealed.": "{@b {@i \"Men\", Not \"Man\".}}\"袋子人 \"的神话表明，只有一个 \"袋子人\"，然而，现实却要险恶得多。当 \"袋人 \"通过一个袋子进入物质世界时，它试图找到回到它最初来的地方的方法。当它不能成功地找到自己的家时，这种生物总是试图把另一个有生命的生物拖回它所谓的家--\"空间之间的空间 \"的怪异境界。如果它的绑架尝试成功了，它通常会在很久之前放弃这个生物，因为它要继续寻找回家的路。没能回到物质世界的生物会发现自己慢慢地被扭曲成一个新的袋子人，注定每晚都要进行同样的仪式，执着地试图找到回到他们来时的路。袋子人为什么绑架生物是一个谜。一些学者认为，这是一种扭曲的反射作用。也许他们认识到了自己的反常本性，他们的一部分希望能被某个头脑仍然完整的人从困境中解救出来。其他人认为他们这样做是受一个黑暗实体的指使，一个未知的邪恶，负责创造第一个包袱人，利用他们作为收集扭曲的下属的手段，进行一些尚未揭示的计划。",
	"{@b {@i The Space Between Spaces.}} For ages it was thought that the space inside a bag of holding was a self contained one, completely separate from the rest of the multiverse, but this is not so. All of these spaces are mere fragments of a much larger plane which scholars refer to as the \"Space Between Spaces\". Every extra-dimensional space such as that found within a bag of holding or portable hole connects to an isolated fragment of this bizarre demi-plane, but for the bagmen and other creatures native to the \"Space Between Spaces\", a bag of holding is not an isolated area, but a gateway to and from the material world. It is unclear if the first magic user to create a bag of holding truly knew what they were doing. Did they know they were linking our world with a nearly empty one governed by monsters? Or perhaps they never stopped to think that there might be something lurking on the other side. ": "{@b {@i The Space Between Spaces.}} 长久以来，人们都认为一个手提袋内的空间是自成一体的，与多元宇宙的其他部分完全分开，但事实并非如此。所有这些空间都只是一个更大的平面的碎片，学者们将其称为 \"空间之间的空间\"。每一个超维空间，比如在袋子里发现的空间或便携洞，都连接到这个奇异的半平面的一个孤立的片段，但对于袋子人和其他 \"空间之间 \"的原生生物来说，袋子不是一个孤立的区域，而是一个进出物质世界的通道。目前还不清楚，第一个创造储物袋的魔法使用者是否真的知道他们在做什么。他们是否知道他们正在将我们的世界与一个由怪物统治的几乎空无一人的世界联系起来？或者，他们从来没有停下来想一想，另一边可能潜伏着什么。"
