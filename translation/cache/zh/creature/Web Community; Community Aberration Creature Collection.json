	"The screamer regenerates 10 hit points at the start of its turn as long as it dealt psychic damage since the start of its last turn. The screamer dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.": "鬼鼠在它的回合开始时再生10个打击点，只要它在上一回合开始时受到精神伤害。鬼鼠只有在它的回合开始时命中率为0并且没有再生时才会死亡。",
	"The first time the screamer passes within 10 feet of a creature during its movement, that creature must make a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition deafened}.": "当鬼鼠在其移动过程中第一次经过一个生物的10英尺范围内时，那个生物必须做一个{@dc 13}的智慧救赎。在拯救失败时，生物受到13({@damage 3d8})的精神伤害并被{@condition deafened}，持续1分钟。拯救成功时，该生物会受到一半的伤害，并且不在{@condition deafened}。",

	"Each of the screamer's many mouths are filled with miniature fangs to snag and catch the unwary. The creature's ears are hidden discreetly inside its body, and its unsettling, alien eyes cluster in groups of three across its forearms and back. Though vaguely humanoid in shape, the screamer is utterly alien, a bizarre mockery of humanity. ": "尖叫者的每张嘴都充满了微型獠牙，以攫取和捕捉不警惕的人。这个生物的耳朵谨慎地隐藏在它的身体里，而它那令人不安的、外来的眼睛在它的前臂和背部聚集成三组。虽然在形状上依稀是人形，但鬼鼠是完全陌生的，是对人类的一种奇怪的嘲弄。",
	"{@b Whistling Wind.} While the screamer has far more mouths than single creature could ever possibly need, it possesses even more voices than it has mouths.

	"The star spawn screamer is an addition to the official star spawn from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. These truly alien foes react with the very air we breathe to create screams, shrieks and squeals that bend and twist the minds of those who hear it. When summoned into our realms the screamers take on a form they believe our minds will be familiar enough with to understand, but the result is a disturbing mass of familiar features in an unfamiliar arrangement.": "星体产卵尖叫者是对莫登凯宁的《敌人之书》中官方星体产卵的补充。这些真正的外星敌人与我们所呼吸的空气发生反应，创造出尖叫声、嘶吼声和尖叫声，使听到它的人的心灵受到弯曲和扭曲。当被召唤到我们的领域时，尖叫者采取了他们认为我们的思想足够熟悉的形式来理解，但结果是在一个陌生的安排中出现了令人不安的大量熟悉的特征。",

On a 4, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 5, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack. On a 6, the creature makes a melee attack against itself.": "喃喃自语者在能看到任何生物时语无伦次，而且不是（%0%）。每个在它的10英尺范围内的生物，如果能听到它的喃喃自语，就必须成功地进行一个{@dc 10}的智慧救赎动作。如果失败，该生物在下一回合开始前不能做出反应，并掷出{@dice d6}来决定它在回合中做什么。在1到3的情况下，该生物不做任何事情。在4时，该生物不采取任何行动或额外行动，并使用它所有的移动力向一个随机决定的方向移动。5时，该生物对其范围内随机确定的生物进行近战攻击，如果它不能进行这样的攻击，则什么也不做。在6的时候，该生物对自己进行一次近战攻击。",

	"{@b Maddening Muttering.} Much like the gibbering mouther, when a mumbling mouther senses life nearby it beings to chatter, blather, prattle and burble.
