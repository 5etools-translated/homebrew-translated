Snow giants offer themselves up as servants to frost giants, most likely as a survival mechanism. The larger giants often employ snow giants as menial domestic servants, forcing them to clean lairs or craft armor and weapons. Frost giants view snow giants as incompetent at waging war, but they send the lesser giants as a vanguard against foes they suspect will prove tougher than their own numbers can handle. The bigger giants also use snow giants as proxies to settle clan disputes or questions of leadership.": "雪地巨人居住在与{@creature frost giant|mm|frost giants}相同的地区，但他们比他们更具攻击性的亲属小得多。雪地巨人向冰霜巨人提供自己的仆人，很可能是一种生存机制。较大的巨人经常雇用雪地巨人作为琐碎的家庭仆人，强迫他们打扫巢穴或制作盔甲和武器。冰霜巨人认为雪地巨人无力发动战争，但他们会派较小的巨人作为先锋，对付他们怀疑会比他们自己的人数更难对付的敌人。大巨人还利用雪巨人作为代理人来解决部族争端或领导问题。",

When not driven by frost giants or by the need to acquire food, snow giants are mirthful and enjoy getting into snowball fights with those they encounter. Among themselves, these snowball fights are akin to children playing in the snow. They are unaware of their own strength when engaging in such activity with smaller beings. The giants quickly realize the harm they inflict, and, provided they don't receive armed retaliation for the accidental injuries they cause, they apologize and revert to using considerably smaller and less impactful snowballs.": "如果雪地巨人有自己的意愿，并设法避免与冰霜巨人共享空间，他们会更关心如何享受他们居住的风雪景观。当不被冰霜巨人或获取食物的需要所驱使时，雪地巨人很爱笑，喜欢和他们遇到的人打雪仗。在他们之间，这些雪球大战就像孩子们在雪地上玩耍一样。他们在与较小的生命进行这种活动时，不知道自己的力量。巨人很快意识到他们造成的伤害，只要他们没有因为意外受伤而受到武装报复，他们就会道歉，并恢复使用小得多、影响较小的雪球。",
	"As most giants are at least touched by primal elements, so too are snow giants partially composed of the element of water, at least in its frozen form. While this offers them considerably less protection than a stone giant's granite flesh, their connection to snow allows them to heal themselves merely by applying a patch of snow to an injury. Packing on snow also allows the snow giants to hide themselves more effectively, which becomes useful when they attempt to avoid the notice of brutal frost giants.": "就像大多数巨人至少被原始元素所触及一样，雪地巨人也是部分由水元素组成的，至少是以冰冻的形式。虽然这为他们提供的保护比石巨人的花岗岩肉体要少得多，但他们与雪的联系使他们只需在伤处涂上一块雪就能治愈自己。积雪也使雪巨人能够更有效地隐藏自己，当他们试图避开残酷的冰霜巨人的注意时，这就变得非常有用。",

	"A shimmer seal allows other seals to see it, and it can allow allied creatures to locate it. The presence of a shimmer seal emboldens the seals under its protection, transforming a pod of seals that might scatter in the face of armed opposition into an army of teeth and flippers, with the shimmer seal leading the counterattack. No one knows if the shimmer seal is aware of its ability to reincarnate shortly after it dies, but its fearlessness points to it possessing a certainty of survival.": "一只闪闪发光的海豹允许其他海豹看到它，而且它可以让盟友的生物找到它。波光粼粼的海豹的存在使受其保护的海豹更有胆量，将一群在面对武装反对时可能四散奔逃的海豹转变为一支由牙齿和脚蹼组成的军队，而波光粼粼的海豹则领导反击。没有人知道粼粼海豹是否知道它死后不久就会转世，但它的无畏精神表明它拥有生存的确定性。",

Shriekbat echolocation uses subsonic frequencies, allowing the bats to fly in relative silence.": "史莱克蝙蝠在地下世界的洞穴中茁壮成长，在那里它们几乎没有面临来自龙、大鹏和其他大型飞行生物的竞争，就像它们在地面上一样。尽管它们体型庞大，但在挤满地下洞穴的钟乳石和石笋中，蝙蝠却能巧妙地穿梭。当它们攻击猎物时，或者在非常罕见的情况下，它们必须逃离捕食者，它们会发出可怕的尖叫声，使敌人不知所措，并使它们能够轻易地抓住猎物或逃跑。尖叫蝠的回声定位使用亚音速频率，使蝙蝠能够在相对安静的环境中飞行。",
	"Kobold bat keepers know the secret to raising young shriekbats. The bat keepers often risk their lives to procure young, using the bats for protection and as companions. A bat keeper returns its shriekbat to the wild before the bat reaches adulthood, when it would become too large for the cramped kobold tunnels. A bat keeper tracks the shriekbats it releases, and often returns to visit its former companions. Shriekbats prove surprisingly keen at remembering former kobold handlers (whether such handlers treated them well or poorly), and they often allow fondly remembered handlers to take a single pup from their litters, ensuring the pup survives to adulthood and renewing the cycle.": "哥布林蝙蝠饲养员知道养育幼年尖叫蝙蝠的秘密。蝙蝠饲养员经常冒着生命危险来获取幼小的蝙蝠，用蝙蝠来保护自己并作为同伴。蝙蝠饲养员会在蝙蝠成年前将其送回野外，因为那时它对狭窄的哥布林隧道来说已经变得太大。蝙蝠饲养员会跟踪它所释放的尖叫蝙蝠，并经常回来看望它以前的同伴。事实证明，史莱克蝙蝠对以前的哥布林饲养员（无论这些饲养员对它们是好是坏）记忆深刻，它们经常允许记忆深刻的饲养员从它们的窝里带走一只幼崽，确保幼崽能存活到成年，并重新开始循环。",
	"Shriekbats live for nearly 50 years. They are social and promiscuous creatures that live in small groups in large caverns. They are omnivorous but prefer fresh meat to other food with lizards taking up the majority of their diet. Shriekbats can survive on rotten flesh, which allows them to eat ghouls and other undead populating the Underworld, but they find it less palatable. In overcrowded situations where multiple groups of shriekbats roost in the same cavern, a group of shriekbats might break away to find another hunting location if food becomes scarce.": "尖叫猫的寿命将近50年。它们是社会性的滥交动物，在大型洞穴中以小群方式生活。它们是杂食性动物，但比起其他食物，它们更喜欢新鲜的肉，蜥蜴占了它们食物的大部分。尖叫蝠可以靠腐肉生存，这使它们可以吃食尸鬼和其他在地下世界居住的亡灵，但它们觉得这不太可口。在过度拥挤的情况下，多群石斑猫在同一个洞穴里栖息，如果食物变得稀少，一群石斑猫可能会脱离出来，寻找另一个狩猎地点。",

Deep trolls are likely to agree to mutually beneficial terms, such as helping them deal with a common enemy or providing them with something they value.": "深海巨魔生活在由七到十五个成员组成的小部落中。他们成群结队地突袭，不过在打猎或拾荒时也能发现他们单独行动。他们有足够的智慧进行交流，但他们很贪婪，当食物出现时，很少能与他们讲道理。它们更喜欢攻击任何可能食用的、不属于本部落的东西，并在以后处理好反作用。在极少数情况下，当面对明显更强大的对手时，它们可以被说服讲道理和讨论条件。深海巨魔很可能会同意互惠互利的条件，比如帮助他们对付共同的敌人，或者向他们提供他们所看重的东西。",
