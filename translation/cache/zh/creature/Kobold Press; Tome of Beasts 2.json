Snow giants offer themselves up as servants to frost giants, most likely as a survival mechanism. The larger giants often employ snow giants as menial domestic servants, forcing them to clean lairs or craft armor and weapons. Frost giants view snow giants as incompetent at waging war, but they send the lesser giants as a vanguard against foes they suspect will prove tougher than their own numbers can handle. The bigger giants also use snow giants as proxies to settle clan disputes or questions of leadership.": "雪地巨人居住在与{@creature frost giant|mm|frost giants}相同的地区，但他们比他们更具攻击性的亲属小得多。雪地巨人向冰霜巨人提供自己的仆人，很可能是一种生存机制。较大的巨人经常雇用雪地巨人作为琐碎的家庭仆人，强迫他们打扫巢穴或制作盔甲和武器。冰霜巨人认为雪地巨人无力发动战争，但他们会派较小的巨人作为先锋，对付他们怀疑会比他们自己的人数更难对付的敌人。大巨人还利用雪巨人作为代理人来解决部族争端或领导问题。",

When not driven by frost giants or by the need to acquire food, snow giants are mirthful and enjoy getting into snowball fights with those they encounter. Among themselves, these snowball fights are akin to children playing in the snow. They are unaware of their own strength when engaging in such activity with smaller beings. The giants quickly realize the harm they inflict, and, provided they don't receive armed retaliation for the accidental injuries they cause, they apologize and revert to using considerably smaller and less impactful snowballs.": "如果雪地巨人有自己的意愿，并设法避免与冰霜巨人共享空间，他们会更关心如何享受他们居住的风雪景观。当不被冰霜巨人或获取食物的需要所驱使时，雪地巨人很爱笑，喜欢和他们遇到的人打雪仗。在他们之间，这些雪球大战就像孩子们在雪地上玩耍一样。他们在与较小的生命进行这种活动时，不知道自己的力量。巨人很快意识到他们造成的伤害，只要他们没有因为意外受伤而受到武装报复，他们就会道歉，并恢复使用小得多、影响较小的雪球。",
	"As most giants are at least touched by primal elements, so too are snow giants partially composed of the element of water, at least in its frozen form. While this offers them considerably less protection than a stone giant's granite flesh, their connection to snow allows them to heal themselves merely by applying a patch of snow to an injury. Packing on snow also allows the snow giants to hide themselves more effectively, which becomes useful when they attempt to avoid the notice of brutal frost giants.": "就像大多数巨人至少被原始元素所触及一样，雪地巨人也是部分由水元素组成的，至少是以冰冻的形式。虽然这为他们提供的保护比石巨人的花岗岩肉体要少得多，但他们与雪的联系使他们只需在伤处涂上一块雪就能治愈自己。积雪也使雪巨人能够更有效地隐藏自己，当他们试图避开残酷的冰霜巨人的注意时，这就变得非常有用。",
