	"A shield dwarf as tough as an ox and as stalwart as a stone wall, Jarhild straps on armor and shield to fight for the ones she considers friends. As a member of the Order of the Burning Dawn, she has the opportunity to protect the innocent and bring justice to the evil... and make a little coin doing it. She's wise, powerful, and experienced in battle tactics, and when the people she loves are threatened, there is little in this world that can withstand her fury.": "作为一个像牛一样坚韧、像石墙一样顽强的盾牌矮人，贾希尔德穿上盔甲和盾牌，为她认为的朋友而战。作为燃烧的黎明骑士团的成员，她有机会保护无辜的人，为邪恶的人伸张正义......并从中赚取一些钱财。她有智慧，有力量，有丰富的战斗策略，当她所爱的人受到威胁时，这个世界上没有什么东西能抵挡她的愤怒。",
	"As a trained soldier, Jarhild is always prepared to do battle, be it on the front lines of a skirmish or the back room of a tavern. When not on the ready for imminent combat, however, she's ready to kick back and blow off steam with the rest of the hard-bitten warriors. She fights hard, and she plays hard, and woe be unto the poor soul who comments on the way she holds herself, the way she dresses, or the way she hefts her sword. As a dwarf who has faced down orc hordes, repelled incursions of giants, and even held fast against a dragon ambush, Jarhild doesn't feel a need to explain herself to anyone. She is who she is: a force to be reckoned with.": "作为一名训练有素的士兵，贾希德总是准备好进行战斗，无论是在小规模战斗的前线还是在酒馆的密室。然而，在没有准备好即将开始的战斗时，她会准备好与其他坚韧不拔的战士一起踢球和吹气。她战斗力强，玩得也很卖力，谁要是对她的举止、穿着或拔剑的方式有意见，那可就惨了。作为一个面对过兽人群、击退过巨人的入侵、甚至坚守过龙的伏击的矮人，贾希德不觉得有必要向任何人解释自己。她就是她：一股不可忽视的力量。",

	"It takes a lot for a young wizard to be exiled from Longsaddle, the home of the famously eccentric Harpell wizards, but Hommet Shaw managed to pull it off. He's a very talented wizard, but his attention to detail leaves something to be desired... to say the least. He's young, and eager, and desperate to prove himself, but, well, necromancy isn't the most widely accepted magical specialty, and it's hard to find a mentor who won't go all \"Dine upon the fearsome hatred of the DEAD!\" on you. When he sees a chance to accompany the heroes into battle, he takes it as a chance to prove himself... and make some friends in the bargain.": "一个年轻的巫师要想被流放出龙鞍，即著名的古怪的哈佩尔巫师的家，需要很多东西，但霍梅特-肖成功地做到了。他是一个非常有天赋的巫师，但他对细节的关注还有待提高......至少可以这么说。他很年轻，也很热心，渴望证明自己，但是，好吧，死灵法术并不是最广泛接受的魔法专业，而且很难找到一个不会对你说 \"在可怕的死亡之恨中进餐 \"的导师。当他看到有机会与英雄们一起战斗时，他把它当作一个证明自己的机会......并在交易中结交一些朋友。",

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from Illydia as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of her. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

With her ever-loyal friend and bodyguard Larethar by her side, she uses her talents with a bow and her goddess' blessings to make up for her own past mistakes.": "作为Sehanine Moonbow的月精灵牧师，Illydia在她140年的时间里所看到的痛苦和损失甚至比大多数精灵一生所看到的还要多，但她对Sehanine Moonbow（月亮和梦想的女神）的信仰使她的头脑保持清醒，内心充满希望。在她永远忠诚的朋友和保镖拉雷萨的帮助下，她利用自己的弓箭天赋和女神的祝福来弥补自己过去的错误。",
