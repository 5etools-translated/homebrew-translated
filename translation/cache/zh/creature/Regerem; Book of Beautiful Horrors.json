Most believe that curses only strike the wrongdoers and sinners, but the truth is that our words and actions can have more power and consequences that we often realize. The story of a botchling is always a sad and gripping tale, as it was cursed from the very moment it entered this world. A botchling hideous outer appearance, a partially-decayed fetus twisted with hatred and malice, can almost be seen as a metaphor for the ugliness of its predicament, it rises from pure sadness and devastation: the corpse of an unwanted infant abandoned in the wild or from a stillborn baby unnamed and discarded without funeral rites.": "诅咒作为我们世界的一部分而存在，有时就像一个受了委屈的仙女的无害诡计一样良性，使牛奶变酸。大多数人认为，诅咒只打击犯错的人和罪人，但事实是，我们的言行可能具有更多的力量和后果，而我们往往意识不到。一条狗的故事总是一个悲伤而扣人心弦的故事，因为它从进入这个世界的那一刻起就被诅咒了。胎儿狰狞的外貌，一个被仇恨和恶意扭曲的部分腐烂的胎儿，几乎可以被看作是其困境的丑陋的隐喻，它从纯粹的悲伤和破坏中升起：一个被遗弃在野外的不受欢迎的婴儿的尸体，或者来自一个没有名字的死产婴儿，没有葬礼仪式而被丢弃。",
	"At times of famine, one more mouth to feed can spell the end for an entire family. Giving birth to an illegitimate child, or gods forbid, a tiefling, could bring shame and accusation of witchcraft to the parents. Sadly, there are many reasons for a child to be abandoned, each more heartbreaking than the last. The feeling of utter abandonment and the complete absence of love that defines the botchling make it glow like a dark beacon for wraiths that are born from powerful negative emotions. As a result, many elements of folklore give to botchling the power to rise or control the undead in some manner, but in truth it is merely a side effect of the botchling's emotions flaring when it becomes agitated.": "在饥荒时期，多养活一张嘴，就意味着整个家庭的结束。生下一个私生子，或者上帝保佑，生下一个盗贼，会给父母带来耻辱和巫术的指控。可悲的是，孩子被遗弃的原因有很多，每一个都比上一个更令人心碎。彻底被遗弃的感觉和完全没有爱的定义，使其像黑暗的灯塔一样照亮了从强大的负面情绪中诞生的裹尸人。因此，许多民间传说中的元素赋予了僵尸以某种方式崛起或控制亡灵的力量，但事实上，这只是僵尸情绪激动时的一种副作用。",
	"The botchling has a feverish hunger for maternal love, a fact that reflects in its feeding habits. A botchling will emerge from its lair at night to lurk by the bedside of an expectant mother, draining her strength and that of her unborn progeny as she sleeps. A woman thus beleaguered first suffers from troubling dreams, then fever, delirium and a general weakening of the flesh. After a few such nights she is enfeebled and unable to defend herself it is then the botchling attacks directly, sinking its long, sharp fangs into her body and drinking her blood until mother and fetus perish together.": "蛇蝎美人对母爱有一种狂热的渴望，这一事实反映在它的进食习惯上。夜晚，僵尸会从它的巢穴中出来，潜伏在孕妇的床边，在她睡觉时耗尽她和她未出生的孩子的力量。这样被困扰的妇女首先会出现令人不安的梦境，然后是发烧、精神错乱和肉体的普遍衰弱。经过几个这样的夜晚，她就会变得虚弱，无法保护自己，这时，僵尸就会直接攻击，把长而锋利的獠牙插入她的身体，喝她的血，直到母亲和胎儿一起灭亡。",

This rite will put the spirit to rest so it can emanate as a lubberkin, a guardian spirit that watches over the family it never knew and the household it never could call its home. However, attempting this rite isn't without risks. Firstly, subduing the botchling itself can prove difficult, and secondly its cries during the rite will attract all sorts of hostile specters and undead. Finally, there is always a chance that a greater wraith called a night maiden will claim the botchling as her own, turning the botchling into a myling.": "拯救僵尸灵魂的唯一方法是，它的父母之一将其作为自己的孩子，以仪式上的方式为其命名，并将其埋在家族庄园的壁炉下。这个仪式将使灵魂得到安息，这样它就可以作为Lubberkin散发出来，一个守护的灵魂，守护着它从未认识的家庭和它从未能称之为家的家庭。然而，尝试这种仪式并不是没有风险。首先，制服僵尸本身可能很困难，其次，它在仪式中的哭声会吸引各种敌对的幽灵和亡灵。最后，总有一种可能性，被称为 \"夜行少女 \"的大巫师会将僵尸视为己有，从而将僵尸变成一个麦林。",
	"A lubberkin looks very similar to a botchling, the main difference being its ghost-like, glowing, white aura and relatively passive behavior. As a benevolent spirit, it comes from a botchling that has been appeased and found its place in the world beyond death. They are attached to their family and will act as a guide, watching over the children and protecting them from harm. Even after their parents have passed, they will care for their brother and sisters, their children, and the following generations. Some lubberkins have been part of the household for as long as anyone can remember and very much become the symbol of the house.": "腽肭兽看起来和僵尸非常相似，主要区别在于它像鬼魂一样的、发光的、白色的光环和相对消极的行为。作为一个仁慈的精神，它来自一个已经被安抚并在死后的世界中找到自己位置的僵尸。他们依恋自己的家庭，会充当向导，看护孩子，保护他们免受伤害。即使在父母去世后，他们也会照顾他们的兄弟姐妹、他们的孩子，以及随后的几代人。从人们有记忆以来，一些长毛狮就一直是家庭的一部分，并在很大程度上成为家庭的象征。",
	"A lubberkin doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "橡皮人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"If a botchling still seeks maternal love in a somewhat twisted way, a myling is a vile wraith that seeks insatiable revenge against parents, incapable of finding closure. A myling was once a botchling that was \"adopted\" and named by a wraith called a night maiden. Myling are {@condition invisible} for anyone but children and revealing their presence will usually require the use of magic. If seen, it takes the ethereal form of the child it would have grown into, with pure evil and hatred in its eyes. Myling are usually active during times of family celebration, especially if it commemorates birth or symbolizes the love uniting a family.": "如果说僵尸还在以某种扭曲的方式寻求母爱的话，那么麦林则是一种卑鄙的巫师，它对父母进行贪得无厌的报复，没有能力找到结束。Myling曾经是一个被 \"收养 \"的僵尸，并被一个叫做 \"夜行少女 \"的巫师命名。Myling对任何人都是（%0%），除了孩子，揭示他们的存在通常需要使用魔法。如果被看到，它就会变成它本来要长成的孩子的虚无形态，眼中充满了纯粹的邪恶和仇恨。麦林通常在家庭庆典时活跃，尤其是在纪念出生或象征着团结家庭的爱情时。",
	"The work of a myling is insidious and clues of its presence are very hard to pick on. It will slowly turn a child against its parents, influencing it and filling its head with lies. As time goes by the child can be found talking to a new imaginary friend and grows resentful of its parents, until it ultimately snaps and commits parricide. Mylings rarely possess a child, however if they are pressed for time or threatened they will not hesitate to be more direct.": "梅林的工作是隐蔽的，其存在的线索很难被发现。它将慢慢地使孩子反对其父母，影响他们，并在他们的头脑中灌输谎言。随着时间的推移，孩子会被发现与一个新的想象中的朋友交谈，并对其父母越来越反感，直到最终崩溃并犯下弑父罪行。麦林斯很少占有孩子，然而如果他们时间紧迫或受到威胁，他们会毫不犹豫地采取更直接的方式。",
	"A myling doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "麦林不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

	"The isolated corners of our world harbor creatures older than humans, older than academies and mages, older even than elves and dwarves. The crones are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they, in fact, are. Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and, since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made daughters out of dirt and water.": "我们世界的偏僻角落里藏着比人类更古老的生物，比学院和法师更古老，甚至比精灵和矮人更古老。女巫就是这样的生物。没有人知道他们的真实姓名，也没有人知道他们实际上是什么品种的怪兽。民间说他们起初有四个。母亲，她--谁--知道，森林之女，从遥远的地方来到这里，由于她深受孤独之苦，她用泥土和水制造了女儿。",
	"A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of land. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals, and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, the land was drowning in blood.": "很久很久以前，母亲是所有土地的唯一统治者。她的女儿们给她带来了人们的要求，并作为她的代言人。每年春天，人们都会在林中夫人的特殊之夜向她献上谷物、动物和人的祭品。然而，随着岁月的流逝，林中夫人在疯狂中越陷越深。她的疯狂最终蔓延到了这片土地上，人们放弃了自己的家园，进入沼泽地，成为野兽的食物。不久之后，这片土地就淹没在血泊之中。",
	"The daughters saw their home nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her into a bog. Her blood watered a mystical oak, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land, and so the daughters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the earth, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.": "女儿们看到她们的家接近毁灭，于是主动承担起拯救家园的责任。当春天再次来临，并伴随着夜间的祭祀，她们杀死了母亲，并将她埋入沼泽。她的血浇灌了一棵神秘的橡树，从那时起，这棵树就为人们长出了健康而丰硕的果实。至于夫人不朽的灵魂，它拒绝离开它心爱的土地，所以女儿们把它囚禁起来。时至今日，它仍被困在地底下，在那里无力地怒吼着。",
	"Common folk refer to the crones as \"The Ladies of the Wood\", \"Norns\", or simply \"The Good Ladies.\" The crones act as the true sovereigns of their land, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. In foul times, when plague or famine steals the harvest, when the gods have abandoned them, when the mighty do not care for their fate, the folks turn to the Ladies for help.": "普通人将老妪称为 \"森林里的女人\"、\"诺恩\"，或者干脆称为 \"好女人\"。女巫们充当着土地的真正统治者，她们帮助土地上的居民度过严酷的时期，以换取他们无条件的顺从。在恶劣的环境下，当瘟疫或饥荒夺走庄稼时，当神灵抛弃他们时，当强大的人不关心他们的命运时，人们会向女士们求助。",

	"A creature that makes a pact with a crone gains a mystical brand somewhere on its body, the brand is unique to each crone. The crone can communicate through the person over any distance, even from another plane of existence, speaking through its mouth.

	"In the more ghastly legends, crones are said to know over a dozen recipes for human soup. During their sabbath, crones truly feed on human flesh, cooking men and children in infernal pots spiced with root from the cursed trees growing in their lair.

The ears hung from trees, allowing the crones, through the use of primeval magic, to hear all that happened in their land.": "在更可怕的传说中，据说女巫知道一打以上的人肉汤食谱。在他们的安息日，女巫们真正以人肉为食，在地狱般的锅里用生长在他们巢穴里的受诅咒的树根调味来烹调男人和孩子。在低声的故事中，如果他们说得太大声，女巫就会听到，村民们会说到以人类耳朵的形式要求的贡品。这些耳朵挂在树上，允许女巫通过使用原始魔法，听到他们土地上发生的所有事情。",
	"Simple curses are easily dealt with by clerics, druids and wizards, becoming nothing more than a temporary annoyance for the wielders of the faith and arcane. However, in ancient times, magic was expressing itself differently, demanding sacrifices to be tamed, powering itself on blood, life essence, and grievous trials. Elder curses tap into these ancient powers: a form of magic that is primal and raw, brutal and cruel. Such curses are not so easily dispelled and will resist most forms of magic. Nothing short of a {@spell wish} spell can remove an elder curse but each elder curse also must have a single means of removing the curse with some deed that the DM designates:": "简单的诅咒很容易被牧师、德鲁伊和巫师处理，对于信仰和奥术的挥舞者来说，这只不过是暂时的烦恼。然而，在古代，魔法以不同的方式表达自己，要求以牺牲来驯服，以血液、生命精华和痛苦的考验为动力。长老诅咒利用了这些古老的力量：一种原始的、粗暴的、残酷的魔法形式。这种诅咒不那么容易被驱散，而且会抵制大多数形式的魔法。除了{@spell wish}的法术外，没有任何东西可以消除长老的诅咒，但每个长老的诅咒也必须有一个由DM指定的某种契约来消除诅咒的方法。",
	"The elder curse must be casted by the crone as a ritual, taking an hour to perform. The effects can target one creature, without limit of distance or planar location, as long as the crone add a part of the target (strand of hair, nail clipping, blood, etc.) as a spell component, consumed during casting.": "长者诅咒必须由老妪作为一种仪式来施展，需要一个小时来完成。效果可以针对一个生物，没有距离或平面位置的限制，只要老妪加入目标的一部分（一缕头发、指甲剪、血液等）作为法术成分，在施法过程中消耗掉。",
	"The elder curse can duplicate the effects of a {@spell bestow curse}, {@spell contagion}, {@spell symbol}, {@spell true polymorph}, or even, if several crones partake in the ritual, a wish spell (Spell DC 18, +2 per crone performing the ritual after the first). Every crone involved in the ritual cannot use their innate spellcasting ability until they completed a short rest.": "长者诅咒可以复制一个（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）、（%3%）的效果，甚至，如果有几个老妪参与仪式的话，还可以复制一个愿望法术（法术DC为18，在第一个仪式之后，每个老妪进行的仪式+2）。每个参与仪式的老妪在完成短暂的休息之前都不能使用他们与生俱来的法术能力。",
	"The deed to lift the curse must be something that the target can accomplish within one year, assuming the task is undertaken immediately (burning all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, climbing the tallest mountain of the world, slaughter an entire bloodline...). Killing the crone doesn't end the curse.": "解除诅咒的行为必须是目标在一年内可以完成的，假设任务是立即进行的（烧掉王国里所有的纺车，爬上世界上最高的山，屠杀整个血统......）。杀死老妪并不能结束诅咒。",
	"The target of the elder curse can have help accomplishing the deed. In fact, someone else can accomplish the deed as long as removing the curse is the expressed purpose of the deed. If someone who doesn't know about the curse accomplishes the deed, the curse remains.": "长者诅咒的目标可以得到帮助来完成这个契约。事实上，只要消除诅咒是该行为的明确目的，其他人也可以完成该行为。如果不知道诅咒的人完成了这个契约，那么诅咒仍然存在。",
	"Crones wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from the elements and destiny and are bound to the land in which they live. The crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses. The crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the land in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.": "女巫拥有强大的魔法，但与法师的魔法不同。她们从元素和命运中汲取力量，并与她们生活的土地联系在一起。女巫可以听到发生在她们森林里的一切，预测未来，扭曲人类生活的线索，带来祝福和诅咒。就所有的意图和目的而言，女巫们似乎是不朽的。神奇的灵药使她们不会衰老，并允许她们拥有年轻女性的外表。这些灵药和她们与所居住的土地的神秘联系也给了她们超自然的力量和活力。",
	"Although theoretically born from the same mother, crones do not necessarily like or even work with each other. Truly enough, some form covens, gather for great sabbath and maintain correspondence with distant sisters, but it is equally true that some hate each other viscerally and wage war against their brethren over feuds so ancient that none but them can remember why. The simple truth is that crones are very unique individuals, and that no simple rule can define their complex relationships.": "虽然理论上是由同一个母亲所生，但女巫们不一定喜欢对方，甚至不一定与对方共事。诚然，有些人组成了教会，聚集在一起过安息日，并与远方的姐妹们保持通信联系，但同样真实的是，有些人在内心深处憎恨对方，并因古老的恩怨而对他们的兄弟们发动战争，除了他们自己，没有人记得原因。一个简单的事实是，女巫是非常独特的个体，没有简单的规则可以定义她们复杂的关系。",
	"A crone's lair isn't usually where she lives, but a mystical center of energy, usually tied to the death of its mother. It holds great significance and importance in the performing of her magic. Sabbaths, seasonal rites and other ceremonial sacrifices are held at the lair or in close vicinity.": "老妪的巢穴通常不是她居住的地方，而是一个神秘的能量中心，通常与它母亲的死亡有关。在施展她的魔法时，它拥有巨大的意义和重要性。安息日、季节性仪式和其他仪式性祭祀都在巢穴或附近举行。",
	"Death Crones have power over death and the undead, especially the ones dying in their land. They have the ability to raise the fallen to serve them and can command necrotic energies. Some believe that death crones gained their abilities by dealing the killing blow to their mother, binding themselves forever to murderous magic in the process. The presence of a death crones is usually felt first by the unusual number of undead roaming the area, especially drowners and foglets. Of all the crones, they are the ones that cast the nastiest curses, usually resulting in slow agonizing death.": "死亡女巫拥有对死亡和亡灵的力量，特别是那些在他们的土地上死去的亡灵。她们有能力让堕落的人复活为她们服务，并能指挥坏死的能量。有些人认为，死亡女巫通过对其母亲的致命一击获得了她们的能力，并在此过程中将自己永远绑定在杀人的魔法上。死亡女巫的存在通常首先被游荡在该地区的不寻常数量的亡灵所感觉到，尤其是溺水者和福尔格特。在所有的女巫中，她们是施放最难听的诅咒的人，通常会导致缓慢的痛苦的死亡。",
	"Flesh crones are gluttonous creatures, feasting constantly on the sacrifices made in their name. They brew stews of human flesh and bake pies filled with children meat. They are physically larger and stronger than their sisters and can regenerate wounds quickly, while dealing terrible blows, dismembering their victims with a single strike. They are the ones that know the secrets of the elixir allowing them to prolong their life indefinitely. Their curses usually turn their victims into wretched beings, especially unfaithful ordesperate women, twisting them into vile hags.": "肉体女巫是一种贪吃的生物，不断地在以他们的名义做出的牺牲上大快朵颐。她们用人肉酿制炖品，烤制充满儿童肉的馅饼。她们在身体上比她们的姐妹们更大更强壮，可以迅速再生伤口，同时给予可怕的打击，一击就能肢解受害者。她们知道灵药的秘密，允许她们无限期地延长自己的生命。她们的诅咒通常会把受害者变成可悲的人，特别是不忠的绝望的女人，把她们扭曲成卑鄙的女巫。",
	"The enigmatic norns, also called Fates, are crones that rule and prophecy the destinies of men. They are often blamed for tragic fates, as they weave destinies to reach a dramatic ending, causing all the malevolent and tragic events in the land. Not all aspects of the norns are negative though, for they are known for visiting newborn children in order to determine his or her future. Sometimes, when a child has an exceptional destiny, they will bestow freely their blessing to assure it will fulfill its fate. The curses cast by norns manipulate events in unforeseeable and tragic ways.": "神秘的诺恩人，也叫命运女神，是统治和预言人类命运的女巫。她们经常被指责为悲剧性的命运，因为她们编织的命运达到了一个戏剧性的结局，造成了这片土地上所有恶性和悲剧性的事件。不过，诺恩人并非所有方面都是负面的，因为他们以访问新生儿以决定他或她的未来而闻名。有时，当一个孩子有一个特殊的命运时，他们会免费赐予他们的祝福，以确保他能完成其命运。诺恩施放的诅咒会以不可预见和悲惨的方式操纵事件。",
	"Primeval crones have an unparalleled connection with their land: They are aware of anything that happens in it thanks to their many crow spies and the ears they hang in trees. They can control the weather and command to beasts throughout their demesne. They can tame the wildest of monstrosities and make them do their bidding. They have a strong affinity with Fiends and Chorts and use them to destroy their enemy or seek the ones that attempt to escape their pact. When they curse a creature, they usually turn it into mindless beast, afflicting it with lycanthropy or driving it insane.": "原始鸦片人与他们的土地有着无与伦比的联系。由于他们有许多乌鸦间谍和挂在树上的耳朵，他们对土地上发生的任何事情都了如指掌。他们可以控制天气，指挥整个领地内的野兽。他们可以驯服最野蛮的怪物，让它们听从他们的命令。他们与恶魔和乔特有很强的亲和力，并利用它们来摧毁他们的敌人或寻找那些试图逃脱他们契约的人。当他们诅咒一个生物时，他们通常会把它变成无意识的野兽，使它受到狼人症的折磨或使它发疯。",

	"Sometimes a drowned man returns as a monster, to haunt the living. Such creature is called a drowner and resembles a corpse dredged from the bottom of a pond. Skinny and humped, with its huge head, slightly protruding belly and concave chest, the drowner became a creature that is half-scary, half grotesque. Its eyes are round and fishlike, granting it a rather dumb expression. It also has wide palms and membranes between its fingers as well as a fin. A Drowner lives underwater and is awkward when on dry land... It is sickly blue or green in color, with slime and sludge oozing out of every pore and the acrid stench of rot wafting off of it. That is why drowners along with their more dangerous cousins: vodniks, mucknixers and drowned dead arise from the bodies of those who drown in shallow water: lost travelers falling into bogs, children who swim too far from the shore or, in the case of vodniks, inebriated peasants who stumble off narrow swamp trails.": "有时，溺水者会作为一个怪物回来，困扰着活人。这样的生物被称为溺水者，类似于从池塘底部挖出的一具尸体。溺水者身材瘦小，驼背，头部巨大，腹部略微突出，胸部凹陷，成为一种半恐怖、半怪异的生物。它的眼睛是圆的，像鱼一样，赋予它一种相当呆滞的表情。它还有宽大的手掌和手指间的薄膜，以及一个鳍。溺水者生活在水下，在干地上时很笨拙...。它的颜色是病态的蓝色或绿色，每个毛孔都渗出粘液和淤泥，身上飘散着刺鼻的腐臭味。这就是为什么溺水者和他们更危险的表亲：Vodniks、Mucknixers和淹死者都来自那些在浅水中淹死的人的尸体：迷路的旅行者掉进沼泽，游得离岸边太远的孩子，或者在Vodniks的情况下，醉醺醺的农民从狭窄的沼泽小路跌倒。",
	"Drowners are predominantly pack creatures by nature, usually hunting in groups of three or greater. Once they have spotted a prey, they will burrow into the ground. This is a sure warning sign that they're preparing an ambush and will try to leap at a prey from beneath the ground. One should always watch for disturbances at its feet when in a swamp. Individually drowners are not much of a threat, but they can become quite dangerous when attacking in pack. Aside from their numbers, their attacks are quite fast and can have surprising range as they usually do leaping jump-strikes; above all else, one should never let itself get surrounded by them. Drowners react to the deaths of their fellows by screaming in pain. This show of mourning leaves them defenseless for several seconds. As they are already dead, drowners do not fear poisons, and even a large loss of blood makes no impression on them.": "溺水者在本质上主要是群居动物，通常以三个或更大的群体进行狩猎。一旦它们发现了猎物，就会钻进地里。这是一个肯定的警告信号，表明它们正在准备伏击，并会试图从地面下跃向猎物。在沼泽地时，人们应始终注意它脚下的干扰。单独的溺水者没有什么威胁，但当它们成群结队地攻击时，就会变得相当危险。除了它们的数量之外，它们的攻击速度相当快，而且范围惊人，因为它们通常是跳跃式的攻击；最重要的是，人们不应该让自己被它们包围。溺水者对其同伴的死亡的反应是痛苦地尖叫。这种哀悼的表现使他们在几秒钟内毫无防备。由于已经死亡，溺水者并不惧怕毒药，即使大量失血也不会对他们产生影响。",
	"Drowners are quite often found at the banks of huge river with regular shipping and riverside villages provides them with ample sustenance. Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators. If not particularly hungry at the moment, they will keep their prey under the water for a few days, aging it until it grows deliciously tender and rotten. Drowners are particularly active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling, at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland.": "溺水者经常出现在巨大的河岸边，定期的航运和河边的村庄为他们提供了充足的食物。它们天生胆小，通常只吃从垃圾堆和动物尸体上挖出来的残渣。然而，如果一个孤独的旅行者或粗心的渔民误入它们的领地，它们就会从拾荒者变成可怕的捕食者。如果此刻不是特别饿，它们会把猎物放在水底几天，使其变老，直到长出美味的嫩肉和腐烂。溺水者在黄昏和夜间特别活跃，尤其是在下雨的时候，在这种时候它们甚至会离开水里的家，到内陆去冒险。",
	"A drowner doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "溺水者不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Particularly strong and dangerous drowners are known as drowned dead, vodniks and mucknixers. Simple people see no difference between the drowner and the drowned dead encountering either of them is equally deadly. We might suppose, though, that the most gloomy legends pretending they can make you drown in the middle of a desert concern the drowned dead rather than drowners.": "特别强壮和危险的溺水者被称为溺水者、vodniks和mucknixers。简单的人认为溺水者和溺水者之间没有区别，遇到他们中的任何一个都是同样致命的。不过，我们可以推测，那些假装能让你在沙漠中溺水的最阴暗的传说涉及的是溺水者而不是淹死者。",
	"Drowned dead arise from the corpse of an executed criminal tossed into the water, while vodniks are the corpses of drowned drunkards. Mucknixers are far rarer, for they come from a necromantic ritual where the victim is purposely drowned to rise as an undead.": "淹死者来自于被处决的罪犯的尸体被扔进水里，而沃德尼克斯是被淹死的醉汉的尸体。Mucknixers则更为罕见，因为他们来自一种亡灵仪式，受害者被故意淹死，然后作为亡灵复活。",
	"The Sisters of the Vale are dryads' member of a mystical sisterhood tied to the Feywild and the Material Plane. The Sisters' nature and origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that they are serving a hidden archfey and that their tendrils of influence reach into many druidic circles, wood elves cultures and tribal societies throughout the world. Although for all their connections, they have never pledged allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court.": "谷地姐妹是干尸的成员，是与仙界和物质世界联系在一起的神秘姐妹会。姐妹会的性质和起源被蒙上了一层神秘的面纱，但人们相信她们是在为一个隐秘的大帝服务，她们的影响力延伸到了世界各地的许多德鲁伊教派、木精灵文化和部落社会。虽然他们与外界的联系很密切，但他们从未向塞里家族或非塞里家族效忠。",
	"The Sisters of the Vale are both loved and feared. Loved, because they respond readily to requests for aid; feared, because the price they exact for assistance is often more than the supplicant is willing to pay. They may imbue young warriors with peerless battleskill, but in exchange steal all kindness from their soul. They might answer the pleas of an elf-maid forlorn in love, then years later steal away her first-born child. It is even within their leaders' power, the green enchantresses, to stave off death's hand, but they will only do so if a life is offered in exchange, and the petitioner is seldom permitted to choose the victim.": "谷地的姐妹们既受人爱戴又令人畏惧。人们爱戴她们，因为她们对援助的请求乐于回应；人们畏惧她们，因为她们为援助付出的代价往往超过了请求者愿意支付的数额。他们可能会给年轻的战士灌输无以伦比的战斗力，但作为交换，他们会从灵魂中偷走所有的仁慈。他们可能会回应一个在爱情中失落的精灵女仆的请求，然后在多年后偷走她的长子。甚至在他们的领袖--绿色女巫--的能力范围内，也可以避免死亡之手，但他们只有在提供生命作为交换的情况下才会这样做，而且请求者很少被允许选择受害者。",
	"The Sisters have sworn an oath to defend the world from the madness of their siblings. When a dryad loses her tree, and begins her descent into a spriggan, the sisterhood will find and confine her in a hidden place, called vale of tears, enspelled into an eternal slumber. In many ways, they have become similar to their charge, exposed constantly to the overwhelming sadness of the spriggans, many lose their playful nature and their fey charm ability in their first years of service hiding their viciousness beneath a graceful aspect. The Sister's secondary goal is to protect the worldroots, the heart of spriggans, from the predation of hags and ill-intentioned mages. Under the guise of the green enchantresses, they fulfil their sacred duty, watching over the vales of tears, protecting natural magical sites, fey crossings and overhaul maintain harmony between worlds.": "姐妹们已经发誓要保卫世界不受他们兄弟姐妹的疯狂影响。当一个干尸失去了她的树，并开始堕落成一个精灵，姐妹会找到她并把她禁锢在一个隐蔽的地方，叫做泪谷，被施以永恒的沉睡。在许多方面，她们已经变得与她们的负责人相似，不断暴露在精灵族压倒性的悲伤中，许多人在服役的第一年就失去了玩耍的天性和精灵的魅力能力，将她们的凶恶隐藏在优雅的外表下。修女的次要目标是保护世界之根，也就是精灵的心脏，免受女巫和心怀叵测的法师的掠夺。在绿色女巫的伪装下，她们履行着神圣的职责，看守着泪谷，保护自然的魔法场所、精灵的交叉点，并维护世界之间的和谐。",
	"The sorority favors subtlety over brute strength, and so when fighting, the Sisters prefer to set ambushes and harassment maneuvers to overcome their foe. It is exceedingly difficult to surprise them and, in most confrontation, they will engage the enemy from a safe distance and cover with a volley of poisonous arrows and spells before retreating into the forest. Depending on the success of the first engagement, they will repeat this technique until the enemy gives up or lies dead. If muscle is necessary they will call upon other fey and primal beasts' allies to honor the ancient pacts of protection.": "联谊会偏重于精巧而非蛮力，因此在战斗时，修女们更喜欢设置伏击和骚扰的手法来战胜敌人。要出其不意是极其困难的，在大多数对抗中，她们会在安全距离内与敌人交战，用一排毒箭和咒语进行掩护，然后退入森林。根据第一次交战的成功与否，他们会重复这种技巧，直到敌人放弃或躺下死亡。如果肌肉是必要的，他们会召唤其他精灵和原始兽的盟友来履行古老的保护契约。",
	"A spriggan is a forest-dwelling fey creature that was long ago a shy and reclusive dryad. Persecuted by humans, the destruction of her tree drove her into madness. Incapable of coping with the loss, the hatred and spite within her soul transformed her, remaking her outer appearance into a thing of horror. Her hair becomes a twisted mass of thorns, briars and twigs, her face distorts into a terrifying and savage visage, her limbs turn long and wood-like, and her fingers become vicious talons capable of rending and impaling her prey. In the soul of a spriggan, there is neither room nor regard for compassion or mercy, merely an uncompromising dedication to nature and vengeance that makes even the most heartfelt vows of elves or men seem trivial by comparison.": "一个精灵是一个居住在森林里的精灵生物，很久以前是一个害羞和隐居的干尸。由于受到人类的迫害，她的树被毁，使她陷入疯狂。由于无法应对损失，她灵魂中的仇恨和怨恨改变了她，使她的外貌变成了一个恐怖的东西。她的头发变成了一团扭曲的荆棘、石楠和树枝，她的脸扭曲成一个可怕而野蛮的面孔，她的四肢变得长而像木头，她的手指变成了能够撕裂和刺穿猎物的凶恶爪子。在精灵族人的灵魂中，既没有同情心，也没有怜悯之心，只有对自然和复仇的毫不妥协的奉献，即使是精灵或人类最真挚的誓言，相比之下也显得微不足道。",
	"When common folks talk about to the \"spirits of the woods\", they very often refer to spriggans. Spriggan are fey made almost entirely of wood and magical energy with a pulsing magical and vegetal heart, the source of their power and known as a worldroot. As the incorruptible keepers of nature, spriggans have an irrational hatred for the undead, constructs and creatures practicing necromancy magic. Their burning hatred is focused on anything that disturb or alter the natural order. Each spriggan has mastery over plants and is inextricably tied to them. Thus, if someone destroys greenery in its domain, it immediately comes to punish the disturber, making them the sworn enemies of those that exploit the forest.": "当普通人谈到 \"森林之灵 \"时，他们通常指的是精灵。雪人是几乎完全由木头和魔法能量构成的精灵，拥有一颗跳动的魔法和植物心脏，是他们力量的源泉，被称为世界根。作为自然界不可侵犯的守护者，斯里根人对亡灵、构造物和修炼死灵魔法的生物有着非理性的憎恨。他们对任何扰乱或改变自然秩序的东西都抱有强烈的仇恨。每个精灵都掌握着植物，并与它们有着千丝万缕的联系。因此，如果有人在它的领域内破坏了绿色植物，它就会立即来惩罚扰乱者，使他们成为那些开发森林的人的死敌。",
	"Spriggans are hellbent on destroying any trace of civilization, regardless of their past friendship or allegiance. No druid or archfey as ever convinced a spriggan to stay its hand, for they no longer simply wait for men to come and take their forest, they take the fight directly to civilization, destroying town and villages, ambushing caravans and turning the very land against them. The most vicious of them will cut food supplies, poison wells and kill the young. The more extreme will even purposely destroy nature so that its resources will not be used, all that matter is the total annihilation of the civilized world. When no trace of man's touch is left, the spriggan removes its worldroot heart from its chest, and buries it in the ground, dying a few moments later, satisfied with the certainty that its vengeance is complete and that nature will retake its right.": "雪人一心想要摧毁任何文明的痕迹，不管他们过去的友谊或忠诚度如何。没有任何德鲁伊或大法官能说服斯里根人留手，因为他们不再简单地等待人类来夺取他们的森林，他们直接向文明开战，摧毁城镇和村庄，伏击商队，让这片土地与他们为敌。他们中最邪恶的人将切断食物供应，在井里下毒，并杀死年轻人。更极端的人甚至会故意破坏自然，使其资源不被利用，所有的事情就是彻底消灭文明世界。当人类的触角没有留下任何痕迹时，精灵族会从胸口取出它的世界之心，并将其埋入地下，片刻后死去，满意地确信它的复仇已经完成，大自然将夺回它的权利。",
	"A worldroot is a sad and beautiful thing, a greenglowing vegetal heart formed of life and fey magic. Growing from the despair and lifeforce of a spriggan, its magical properties are particularly soughtafter by hags, druids and dryads:": "世界之根是一个悲伤而美丽的东西，一个由生命和精灵魔法形成的绿色植物心脏。它从一个精灵的绝望和生命力中生长出来，它的魔法特性尤其受到女巫、德鲁伊和干尸的追捧。",
	"If buried in the ground, the worldroot creates the same regional effects as a spriggan's lair.": "如果埋在地下，世界之根会产生与精灵之巢相同的区域效应。",
	"A fey hag, druid or dryad can cast the spell {@spell resurrection} as a ritual on a humanoid creature, replacing its heart with the worldroot. In the case of a hag or a dryad, the creature is magically {@condition charmed} by the fey until the fey dies. The {@condition charmed} target is under the fey's control, unless she releases it, and the fey and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.": "女巫、德鲁伊或干尸可以对一个人形生物施以{@spell resurrection}的法术作为仪式，用世界之根替换它的心脏。在女巫或干尸的情况下，该生物在魔法上被妖怪{@condition charmed}，直到妖怪死亡。除非她释放目标，否则目标会被妖精控制，妖精和目标可以在任何距离上进行心灵感应。",
	"A spriggan's lair almost always encompasses the past location of her fallen tree, when she was still a dryad. The lair's ground is littered with the bones of the humanoids she killed and includes abundant vegetation and magic, such as moss-covered dolmens, raised stone circles or other elements associated with druidism. As spriggans have the power to turn nearby trees into allies, trees inside the lair should be especially watched for.": "一个精灵的巢穴几乎总是包含了她过去倒下的树的位置，那时她还是一个干尸。巢穴的地面上到处都是她杀死的人类的骨头，包括丰富的植被和魔法，如覆盖着苔藓的石墓、凸起的石圈或其他与德鲁伊教有关的元素。由于精灵族有能力将附近的树木变成盟友，因此巢穴内的树木应特别注意。",
	"The green enchantresses are eternal dryads that guide the Sisters of the Vale; they are the keepers of the old ways; holding the knowledge of the rites and terms of pacts made in past eras. They uphold fey and men to their words, even if those where uttered thousands of years ago. Above all else, they commemorate the memory of their fallen sisters and watch over the worldroots, knowing the story of each. So too are they versed in ancient curses, of words that can sap strength or cause their victim to fly into a rage so consuming that it slaughters its own kin without compunction. Over their eternal life they learn the magical secrets of the worldroots, gaining powerful abilities.": "绿色女巫是引导谷地姐妹的永恒干尸；她们是古老方式的守护者；掌握着过去时代的仪式和契约条款的知识。她们维护精灵和人类的话语，即使这些话是几千年前说的。最重要的是，他们纪念他们死去的姐妹，并看守着世界的根，知道每个人的故事。他们也精通古老的诅咒，了解那些可以削弱力量或使受害者陷入愤怒的话语，以至于毫无顾忌地屠杀自己的亲属。在他们永恒的生命中，他们学习世界的魔法秘密，获得强大的能力。",
	"A green enchantress never ages and succumbs to injury only briefly. Should one be slain, her siblings place her body upon a bier of root and ivy, and bear it away to the hallowed halls beneath a vale of tears. There, she slumbers away the weeks and months until the arrival of a new spring, where the roots of magic and life-energy restores her to existence. Only if her tree is destroyed or her body irretrievable or mutilated beyond all recognition does her spirit flee the mortal world, leaving her bereaved sisters to exact vengeance on her slayer.": "一个绿色的女魔法师永远不会衰老，只会短暂地屈服于伤害。如果她被杀了，她的兄弟姐妹会把她的尸体放在一个由树根和常春藤组成的棺材上，并把它抬到泪水谷下的神圣大厅里。在那里，她沉睡了数周和数月，直到新的春天到来，在那里，魔法和生命能量的根使她恢复了存在。只有当她的树被毁，或她的身体无法复原，或被肢解得面目全非时，她的灵魂才会逃离凡间，让她失去亲人的姐妹们对她的杀手进行报复。",
	"The mystical senses of a Green Enchantress see far and wide, her gaze reaching beyond the borders of her vale. Sometimes, when a mortal catches her sight or she is in need of an inconspicuous agent, she will wait for it to fall in battle or orchestrate his death and then offer to save him, replacing his heart by a worldroot. Those so blessed receive magic and power, becoming warlocks. A Green Enchantress' motivations are at times inscrutable, but will often involve keeping the mortal and fey world separated, forcing a party to uphold their end in a mystical bargain or keeping an ancient evil contained.": "绿袍女巫的神秘感官看得很远很广，她的目光超越了她谷地的边界。有时，当一个凡人引起她的注意，或者她需要一个不显眼的代理人时，她会等待他在战斗中倒下，或者策划他的死亡，然后提出拯救他，用一个世界之根取代他的心脏。受此恩惠的人得到魔法和力量，成为术士。绿女巫的动机有时是难以捉摸的，但通常会涉及到保持凡人和精灵世界的分离，迫使一方在神秘的交易中坚持自己的立场，或保持一个古老的邪恶。",
	"If night ever catches you in the swamps, stay put and wait for dawn, even if it means standing waist-deep in water with leeches crawling down your trousers. Most important of all, if you see a light in the fog, never, and I mean never, go towards it.": "如果夜晚在沼泽地里抓到了你，请留在原地等待黎明，即使这意味着站在齐腰深的水里，水蛭在你的裤子上爬行。最重要的是，如果你在雾中看到一束光，千万不要，我是说千万不要，走向它。",
	"Fog is the traveler's foe. In the forest, it can make one lose one's way, at sea, it can send one sailing into the rocks. Yet such dangers are nothing compared to the monsters known as foglets which sometimes lurk within it. These creatures have powerful arms and claws, yet what makes them truly dangerous is their mastery of deception, beguilement and disorientation. Many times they need not attack at all, instead simply driving their prey to madness or into boggy marshlands, after which they wait patiently for it to drown in the muddy waters.": "雾是旅行者的敌人。在森林里，它能使人迷失方向；在海上，它能使人驶向岩石。然而，这些危险与有时潜伏在雾中的被称为 \"foglets \"的怪物相比不算什么。这些生物有强大的手臂和爪子，然而使它们真正危险的是它们对欺骗、引诱和迷惑的掌握。很多时候，它们根本不需要攻击，而只是把猎物逼到疯狂的境地，或者进入沼泽地，然后耐心地等待猎物淹死在泥泞的水中。",
	"Like ghastly glowworms, their bodies emit a pale light they use to lure those lost in the fog towards the ravines, swamps or caves in which they make their lairs. Legends say that foglets are will-o'-wisps coming from the soul of truly despicable killers. After a time, once they consumed enough life force, they inhabit a corpse and twist it into a monstrous foglet, becoming material and free to kill once more. In parts of the world where the evil lights are common occurrences, cultures tend to practice cremation as a funeral rites, to prevent corpse to be inhabited by these spirits.": "就像可怕的萤火虫一样，它们的身体发出淡淡的光，用来引诱那些在雾中迷路的人走向峡谷、沼泽或洞穴，在那里它们有自己的巢穴。传说中，foglets是来自真正卑鄙的杀手的灵魂的意愿。一段时间后，一旦他们消耗了足够的生命力，他们就会居住在一具尸体上，并将其扭曲成一个可怕的雾状物，成为物质并再次自由地杀人。在世界一些地方，邪光是普遍存在的，文化上倾向于采用火化作为葬礼仪式，以防止尸体被这些精神所占据。",
	"Foglets can appear wherever thick fog arises: swamplands, mountain passes or the shores of rivers and lakes. If no fog is forthcoming, they can create or summon it hemselves. By manipulating fog they can separate travelers from each other, hide trails and deafen noise. While foglets can disappear at will, watching for moving patches of fog or grass swaying in a path leading directly to their victims is one way to identify their location.": "浓雾出现的地方都可以出现Foglets：沼泽地、山口或河流和湖泊的岸边。如果没有雾出现，他们可以自己创造或召唤雾。通过操纵雾气，他们可以将旅行者彼此分开，隐藏踪迹，使噪音消失。虽然雾人可以随意消失，但观察移动的雾块或在直接通往受害者的道路上摇摆的草是识别他们位置的一种方法。",
	"Rapidly thickening fog tends to be a sign that foglets are close. When fighting foglets, an adventurer must remain calm and keep his wits about him no matter what. Since foglets can take on immaterial form, a slight shimmer of air or a rustle in the grass might be the only clues an adventurer has to their location. Foglets create illusions of themselves that can cause physical harm, while the real foglet stalks the area.": "迅速变浓的雾气往往是一个迹象，表明oglets正在接近。在与雾虫战斗时，冒险者必须保持冷静，并在任何情况下都要保持他的智慧。由于雾霾可以变成非物质形态，空气的轻微闪光或草丛中的沙沙声可能是冒险者了解其位置的唯一线索。雾灵会制造自己的幻觉，可以造成身体上的伤害，而真正的雾灵则会在该地区徘徊。",
	"A foglet doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "雾状物不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Particularly old and vicious foglets are called ignis fatuus. Over their long existence they have mastered the art of trickery and can dissimulate their lair through intricate illusions. They will often attract other wicked souls, will-o'-wisp, and have the ability to summon a deadly lingering fog.": "特别是古老而凶恶的foglets被称为ignis fatuus。在他们长期的存在中，他们已经掌握了诡计的艺术，可以通过复杂的幻觉来掩盖他们的巢穴。他们经常会吸引其他邪恶的灵魂，will-o'-wisp，并有能力召唤出致命的缠绵之雾。",
	"Ignis Fatuus make their lair is deep cave networks or abandoned keeps. They usually pick places with strong magical connection, like places of power or wild magic, somehow feeding on its energy.": "伊格尼丝-法图斯把他们的巢穴建在深邃的洞穴网络或废弃的城堡里。他们通常选择有强烈魔法联系的地方，如有力量或野生魔法的地方，以某种方式吸收其能量。",
	"Bone ghasts differ from normal ghasts by the protruding bone armor and spikes they can retract or extend out of their body. Elevated by the demon lord Orcus to dominate lesser ghouls, bone ghasts are far more aggressive and are capable of forethought, and thus much more dangerous. Ghouls seem to possess enough wits to at least know a brighter mind when they see it, and so let a bone ghast lead their packs. A pack so led will terrorize all in its path, attacking not only lone travelers but also caravans, farmsteads and even hamlets. A bone ghast cunning shows when facing a stronger prey, for it will maneuver lesser ghouls to harass and soften it, so it can finish the job by tearing it to shreds. Once its prey is down the bone ghast is the first of the pack to feed, cracking bones with ease to suck the marrow out of it.": "骨兽与普通的食尸鬼不同，它们有突出的骨甲和尖刺，可以缩回或伸出身体。由恶魔领主奥库斯（Orcus）提升到支配较小的食尸鬼的地位，骨质食尸鬼更具攻击性，并且能够预先思考，因此更加危险。食尸鬼似乎拥有足够的智慧，至少在看到它的时候知道它是一个更聪明的头脑，所以让骨兽领导它们的族群。这样带领的队伍会让所有的人感到恐惧，不仅攻击孤独的旅行者，也攻击商队、农庄，甚至是小村庄。在面对更强大的猎物时，骨魔的狡猾表现得淋漓尽致，因为它将操纵较小的食尸鬼来骚扰和软化它，这样它就可以通过把它撕成碎片来完成工作。一旦它的猎物倒下了，食骨兽就会首先进食，轻松地敲碎骨头以吸食骨髓。",
	"Bone ghasts are active around dusk and at night, when they go out to find a prey. Once they did, they rush in recklessly, protected by their natural armor and dangerous bone spikes, they hope to impale their opponent and count on their regenerative capacity to survive. When fighting, they emit loud shrieks that can destabilize anybody near them. However, behind this bold demeanor hides the weakness of the bone ghast, for if it is {@condition frightened} it will uncontrollably retract its bony protection, leaving it much more vulnerable.": "白骨巨兽在黄昏前后和夜间活跃，这时它们会出去寻找一个猎物。一旦找到了，它们就不顾一切地冲进去，在它们的天然盔甲和危险的骨刺的保护下，它们希望能刺死对手，并指望它们的再生能力来生存。战斗时，它们发出响亮的尖叫声，可以破坏附近任何人的稳定。然而，在这种大胆的举止背后，隐藏着骨魔的弱点，因为如果它（%0%）会不受控制地缩回它的骨质保护，使它更加脆弱。",
	"These demonic ghouls wreak havoc over entire regions in the name of their demon master. In battle, crypt horrors use their formidable strength to smash aside those brave enough to stand before them, but it is their meat-encrusted fangs and talons that are to be avoided at all costs. Even a shallow wound from a crypt horror bears enough poisonous rot to kill a horse. One daunting fact about crypt horrors is their ability to resist most form of conventional protection against the undead. They can pass the sacred seals protecting unviolated burial crypts without as much as a shudder, or step into hallowed ground without any difficulty. The combination of demonic and necromatic energies animating them even make them immune to the turning ability of the most powerful clerics.": "这些恶魔般的食尸鬼以其恶魔主人的名义对整个地区造成了破坏。在战斗中，地穴恐怖用它们强大的力量将那些敢于站在它们面前的人打倒在地，但要不惜一切代价避开它们那长满肉的獠牙和爪子才行。即使是来自地穴恐怖的浅浅的伤口，也会有足够的毒物腐烂，可以杀死一匹马。关于地穴恐怖的一个令人生畏的事实是，它们能够抵御大多数针对亡灵的常规保护形式。它们可以通过保护未被侵犯的地下墓穴的神圣封印，而不会有丝毫的颤抖，或者毫无困难地踏入神圣的土地。赋予他们生命的恶魔和死灵能量的结合甚至使他们对最强大的牧师的转化能力产生免疫。",
	"The pallid creatures known as ghoul regents are in fact once-proud elven lords and ladies forced into a troglodytic existence. They once followed and worshipped Doresain, the first ghoul, and serve as its clergy. As undead, they have devolved to become something far fouler and more hate-filled than their brethren, their physical appearance soon came to reflect their miserable condition, turning them into hunched and grotesque monstrosities. However, ever since the downfall of their demigod, these ghouls have been shunned and hunted down by gnolls and demons of Yeenoghu and forced into exile.": "被称为食尸鬼摄政者的脸色苍白的生物实际上是曾经高傲的精灵领主和女士，他们被迫进入了食尸鬼的生活。他们曾经追随并崇拜第一个食尸鬼Doresain，并作为其神职人员。作为不死之身，他们已经演变为比他们的兄弟们更肮脏、更充满仇恨的东西，他们的身体外观很快就反映了他们的悲惨状况，变成了驼背和怪异的畸形。然而，自从他们的半神倒台后，这些食尸鬼就被地精和耶诺古的恶魔们回避和追杀，并被迫流亡。",
	"Ghoul lore hearkens back to a land sacred to ghouls called the White Kingdom. Though ghouls bound to the mortal plane sometimes create lesser versions of what they believe the White Kingdom to be, it is accepted that the true incarnation of the White Kingdom can be found on the layer of the Abyss where the ghoul regents once ruled. Since their demise, the ghoul regents await the return of the King of the Ghouls, Doresain, and the coming of the night where they would enact a dire vengeance and retake the White Kingdom at the head of shambling undead armies.": "食尸鬼的传说可以追溯到一个对食尸鬼来说很神圣的地方，叫做白色王国。尽管被束缚在凡间的食尸鬼有时会创造出他们认为是白色王国的较小版本，但人们认为白色王国的真正化身可以在食尸鬼摄政者曾经统治过的深渊层找到。自从他们灭亡后，食尸鬼摄政者们等待着食尸鬼之王多雷因的回归，以及黑夜的到来，在那里他们将实施可怕的复仇，并在晃动的亡灵军队的带领下重新夺回白之国。",
	"Packs of flesh-eating ghouls are attracted to these dismals and often form grotesque courts around them. Grave robbers, and those who steal from the bodies of the fallen, have learned well that they must practice their depraved crafts in the twilight and be home before nightfall. Under cover of darkness, different breeds of scavengers fall on these places of death. From their catacomb, haunted wood, moss-covered ruin and forgotten places of the world, ghoul regents spy on their enemies, the servants of Yeenoghu, and on their lost past, the elven courts, reminded of what they lost, bitterness and envy gnawing at their minds. In their desolation, many of them lost their sanity completely and became pathetic parasites, wary of attracting attention.": "一群吃肉的食尸鬼被吸引到这些残骸上，并经常在它们周围形成怪异的法庭。盗墓者和那些从死者尸体上偷窃的人已经很清楚地知道，他们必须在黄昏时分从事他们堕落的手艺，并在夜幕降临前回家。在黑暗的掩护下，不同品种的清道夫落在这些死亡的地方。从他们的地下墓穴、闹鬼的树林、长满苔藓的废墟和被遗忘的地方，食尸鬼摄政者监视着他们的敌人--耶诺古的仆人，以及他们失去的过去--精灵法庭，提醒着他们失去的东西，苦涩和嫉妒啃噬着他们的心灵。在他们的荒凉中，他们中的许多人完全失去了理智，成为可怜的寄生虫，小心翼翼地吸引人们的注意。",
	"Even if most of them have to some degree lost their minds during their exile, the ghoul regents still possess many powerful abilities. They can tear to shreads a victim in the blink of an eye, and their authority over the ghouls is strong. Their immortal body become as hard as iron and regenerates at heighten speed, coursing with the sustaining power of necromancy. Such dark magic must to be dispelled to destroy the creature. They can innately use necromancy, but they do so in their own instinctual way. Their magic is less subtle than the forms of necromancy practiced by other elevated undead, but in the cut and thrust of combat, their savagery gives them a definite edge.": "即使他们中的大多数人在流放期间在某种程度上失去了理智，食尸鬼摄政者仍然拥有许多强大的能力。他们可以在眨眼间将受害者撕成碎片，而且他们对食尸鬼的权威是强大的。他们不朽的身体变得像铁一样坚硬，并以极快的速度再生，其中流淌着死灵法术的持续力量。这样的黑暗魔法必须被驱散才能摧毁这种生物。他们可以天生使用死灵法术，但他们以自己的本能方式这样做。他们的魔法没有其他高阶亡灵所练习的死灵法术那么微妙，但在战斗的切磋中，他们的野蛮给了他们绝对的优势。",
	"Those infected by the diseased bite of a ghoul may contract Doresain's Plague, more commonly known as ghoul fever. Those who perish from this rotting illness rise at the next midnight as ghouls themselves. In this way, some undead recruit the formerly living into their shuffling ranks:": "那些被食尸鬼的病态咬伤的人可能会感染多雷因的瘟疫，更常见的是食尸鬼热。那些死于这种腐烂的疾病的人在下一个午夜复活，成为食尸鬼本身。通过这种方式，一些不死族将以前的活人招募到他们混乱的队伍中。",
	"When the ghoul hits a creature with a bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 13 (3d8) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured. A humanoid killed by this disease rises at the next midnight as a ghoul, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.": "当食尸鬼用咬人攻击击中一个生物时，它必须在DC15宪法救赎中成功，否则就会感染疾病。在疾病被治愈之前，除非通过魔法手段，否则目标无法恢复命中率，而且目标的最大命中率每24小时减少13（3d8）。如果目标的最大命中率由于这种疾病而下降到0，则目标死亡。这种对目标最大命中率的降低会持续到疾病被治愈。被这种疾病杀死的人形生物会在下一个午夜作为食尸鬼复活，除非该人形生物被恢复生命或其身体被摧毁。",
	"A ghoul regent always establishes a place of worship to the King of the Ghouls and only underground. Small shrines can sometimes be found in underground mausoleums or at the catacomb's center, but fully functioning temples are erected only in the deepest subterranean realms, surrounded by a community of ghouls the size of a small city.": "食尸鬼摄政者总是建立一个崇拜食尸鬼之王的地方，而且只在地下。有时可以在地下陵墓或地下墓穴的中心找到小型神殿，但功能齐全的神殿只竖立在最深的地下领域，周围有一个相当于一个小城市大小的食尸鬼社区。",
	"Many consider ghouls to be scavengers, feeding on old corpses in forgotten catacombs that no one cares about anymore. Some would even argue that they can be usefully during epidemics, preventing the disease to spread by getting rid of the infected bodies. Many are fools. This misconception becomes clear when facing a ghoul skulker, a ghoul that has developed an appetite for fresh and bloody meat. These undead predators have evolved to suit their craving, becoming deadly and silent hunters that slip unnoticed into settlements to devour their {@condition paralyzed} victim alive, leaving behind nothing but a skeleton in a back alley.": "许多人认为食尸鬼是清道夫，以被遗忘的地下墓穴中无人问津的旧尸体为食。有些人甚至认为，他们在流行病期间可以发挥作用，通过处理受感染的尸体来防止疾病传播。许多人都是傻瓜。这种误解在面对食尸鬼skulker时变得很明显，这种食尸鬼已经形成了对新鲜和血腥的肉的胃口。这些不死的掠食者已经进化到适合他们的渴望，成为致命的、无声的猎手，在不知不觉中溜进定居点，活生生地吞噬他们（%0%）的受害者，只留下后巷里的一具骷髅。",
	"Far more independent than their regular kind, ghoul skulkers rival ghasts in their viciousness. They hunt ahead of a ghoul pack and try to pick off lone wanderers or stragglers for an easy kill. If able, they will creep on an unsuspecting prey, falling from the ceiling or performing surprising jumps to incredible heights and distances. Although naturally quiet and a master of ambushes, the presence of a ghoul skulker can often be hinted at by the sound of their claws scraping against whatever surface they happen to be crawling along, as well as a sibilant hissing sound. In combat, they rely on their lashing tongue to paralyze as many enemies as possible, focusing their attack on weaker targets and avoiding threatening foes.": "比起普通的同类，食尸鬼潜行者更加独立，他们的凶狠程度可以与食尸鬼相媲美。他们在食尸鬼群体的前面狩猎，并试图挑出孤独的流浪者或落单者，以便轻松地杀死他们。如果可以的话，他们会匍匐在毫无防备的猎物身上，从天花板上掉下来，或者进行令人惊讶的跳跃，达到难以置信的高度和距离。虽然它们天生安静，是伏击的高手，但食尸鬼的存在往往可以通过它们的爪子刮擦它们碰巧爬行的任何表面的声音，以及咝咝的嘶嘶声来暗示出来。在战斗中，他们依靠自己的舌头来麻痹尽可能多的敌人，把攻击重点放在较弱的目标上，避免威胁敌人。",
	"Not too long ago the areas around peasant hamlets were chock full of guardian spirits. Today it's nigh unto impossible to spot a brownie, bucka or lutin. And godlings, they are always the first to go. Such is the price we pay for civilization's forward march.": "不久前，农民村落周围的地区还充满了守护神。今天，要想发现一个布朗尼、巴卡或鲁丁几乎是不可能的。而神灵，他们总是第一个离开。这就是我们为文明的前进所付出的代价。",
	"In remote villages, when food is scarce and winter is harsh, a desperate couple sometimes resort to the old ways to give their newborn a better chance at life. The legend says that when a babe is sick and weak, its parents should bring it deep into the woods, on a fairy hillock or in a glade were sprites and pixies can be spotted sometimes. They should return on the next day, for their child will have been taken by the fairfolks, to live eternally amongst them, lacking for nothing. In exchange, a new babe will be waiting for the parents, wearing somewhat the appearance of their child, a godling. If cared for and nursed with love, the godling will grow benevolent, aside from an inborn aptitude for trickery. If mistreated or abandoned, it will shrivel and grow bitter, becoming a vile entity, a bucka, causing death with deadly pranks.": "在偏远的村庄，当食物匮乏、冬季严寒的时候，一对绝望的夫妇有时会采用古老的方法，给他们的新生儿一个更好的生活机会。传说中，当一个婴儿生病和虚弱时，他的父母应该把他带到森林深处，在一个仙女山岗上或在一个有时可以看到精灵和小精灵的小树林里。他们应该在第二天回来，因为他们的孩子会被仙女们带走，永远生活在他们中间，什么都不缺。作为交换，一个新的婴儿将等待着父母的到来，他在某种程度上穿着他们孩子的外表，一个神灵。如果用爱来照顾和哺育，除了天生的诡计能力外，神灵将成长为仁慈的人。如果被虐待或遗弃，它将萎缩并变得痛苦，成为一个卑鄙的实体，一个Bucka，用致命的恶作剧造成死亡。",
	"Godlings are woodland fey dwelling in burrows and moss-covered hollow stumps on the outskirts of settlements, but a few accounts exist of some living in abandoned buildings in small towns or even cities. Godlings are similar to children in behavior and appearance, with big bright eyes differing in color (often blue and yellow, but lilac and grey have been reported as well), and pale blue, deep green or even violet skin. Like children, they delight in mischief, especially targeting vain and selfish individuals, which unfortunately leads to many seeing them as a nuisance. Buckas and godlings can be hurt by an herb called Burdock, which they despise the smell of, and is often used to drive them away. Most are unaware that the true blessing of a godling resides in its role of mediator between the fey world and civilization. Many villages would have been raised by scorned dryads or a wrathful leshen if it wasn't for the opportune intervention of a godling.": "神雏是林地里的精灵，住在居民区外围的洞穴和长满苔藓的空心树桩里，但也有少数人住在小城镇甚至城市的废弃建筑里。小神童的行为和外表与儿童相似，有一双明亮的大眼睛，颜色各异（通常是蓝色和黄色，但也有报告说是淡紫色和灰色），皮肤呈淡蓝色、深绿色甚至紫色。像孩子一样，他们喜欢恶作剧，特别是针对虚荣和自私的人，不幸的是，这导致许多人把他们视为讨厌的人。巴卡斯和神灵会被一种叫牛蒡的草药所伤害，它们鄙视这种草药的气味，经常被用来驱赶它们。大多数人都不知道，神灵的真正祝福在于它在精灵世界和文明之间的调解人角色。如果不是因为神灵的适时干预，许多村庄会被被蔑视的干尸或愤怒的莱辛抚养长大。",
	"Godlings are deeply rooted in their home territory and perform acts of care and guardianship to those dwelling near it. They watch over people as well as animals, but, shy creatures by nature, they try to do so while remaining unseen. Godlings are drawn to joy and innocence, and so delight in the company of children and usually only show themselves to the young. These mischievous fey gladly perform small services for those in their care, asking only for respect and payment in the form of food or cast-off items in return. They are easily offended by churlish, ungrateful or simply rude behavior. Godlings also treasure their peace and quiet, but will go out of their way to help lost travelers, especially in dangerous regions of the Feywild. When the village a godling watches over becomes too populous or its inhabitants forget the old ways, it will abandon its burrow for good and wander into the Feywild.": "神灵深深地扎根于他们的家园领地，对居住在领地附近的人进行照顾和监护。他们照看人和动物，但由于天性害羞，他们试图在不被发现的情况下这样做。神灵被快乐和纯真所吸引，因此乐于与儿童为伴，通常只向年轻人展示自己。这些调皮的精灵很乐意为他们所照顾的人提供小的服务，只要求得到尊重和以食物或废弃物品的形式作为回报。他们很容易被无礼、忘恩负义或简单粗暴的行为所冒犯。神灵也珍惜他们的和平与安静，但会不遗余力地帮助迷路的旅行者，特别是在精灵世界的危险地区。当神灵守护的村庄变得人口太多，或者其居民忘记了旧有的方式，它就会永远地放弃它的洞穴，流浪到仙境中。",

But if, gods forbid, a grave hag takes to feeding at your cemetery, you'll have no end of trouble.": "火葬，这是人类可以向侏儒学习的一件事。把尸体埋在田野里，为什么，这就像为怪物铺设了一张欢迎垫！最好的情况是，一些食尸鬼会闻到他们的气味，吃掉他们的东西，然后走上他们的食尸路。最好的情况是，一些食尸鬼会闻到他们的气味，吃饱后就走他们的食尸路。但是，如果上帝保佑，一个墓婆在你的墓地进食，你就会有无穷的麻烦。",
	"Few monsters' names fit as well as the grave hags'. As one might guess, these creatures resemble aged, deformed women and loiter near graveyards and battlefields. Grave hags feed on human corpses and in particular on the rotten marrow which they slurp from human bones using their long, prehensile tongues. Most grave hags rarely attack humans, preferring instead to feed on the rotten remains they dig out of graves. Yet some individuals grow bold over the years and begin sneaking into huts to steal children and kill the elderly. Once a hag has devoured all corpses within reach, she turns to killing men and burying them in the cemetery as she waits for them to decompose or raise them as servants.": "很少有怪物的名字能像墓婆那样合适。正如人们所猜测的那样，这些生物类似于年老的、畸形的妇女，在墓地和战场附近游荡。墓婆以人的尸体为食，特别是以腐烂的骨髓为食，它们用长长的、无柄的舌头从人的骨头上啜饮。大多数墓妖很少攻击人类，而是喜欢以它们从坟墓中挖出的腐烂遗体为食。然而，有些人多年来胆子越来越大，开始潜入小屋偷窃儿童和杀害老人。一旦墓婆吞噬了所有触手可及的尸体，她就会转而杀死男人，并将他们埋在墓地里，等待他们腐烂，或将他们作为仆人抚养。",
	"Grave Hags are notorious child killers, making them one of the most despised monster there is. They typically kidnap wandering children or sneak in their home at night, attracted by their innocence, glowing like a beacon in the dark for them. After they ate a child, they then use its remains as magical focus, building altars of little bones to practice their magic. The skull of a child is of special importance to them, as they craft powerful talismans with it, enslaving its soul. Some hags are even known to strap the entire skeleton of the child on their back, wearing it as a protection charm.": "墓婆婆是臭名昭著的儿童杀手，使他们成为最令人鄙视的怪物之一。他们通常绑架流浪儿童或在夜间潜入他们的家中，被他们的纯真所吸引，像黑暗中的灯塔一样为他们发光。他们吃了一个孩子后，就把孩子的遗体作为魔法的焦点，用小骨头搭建祭坛来练习魔法。孩子的头骨对他们来说特别重要，因为他们用它制作强大的护身符，奴役其灵魂。有些女巫甚至把孩子的整个骨架绑在背上，作为保护符来佩戴。",
	"Grave hags are territorial and aggressive when provoked, they will put up a fierce fight, using their great speed to rapidly close on prey. The tongue of a grave hag can surprise even veteran fighter with the speed and range it can lash out. Being struck by it can cause temporary blindness, or even paralysis, leaving the victim unable to properly defend themselves. The claws of a grave hag are sharp, but not enough that skilled swordplay cannot defend against them.": "墓婆的领地性很强，一旦被挑衅，它们就会展开激烈的战斗，利用它们强大的速度迅速接近猎物。墓婆的舌头可以让老手都感到惊讶，因为它的速度和范围都很广。被它击中会导致暂时性失明，甚至瘫痪，使受害者无法正确地保护自己。墓婆的爪子很锋利，但还不至于让熟练的剑术无法抵御它们。",
	"Grave hags rarely join covens, as the magic they practice is more akin to necromancy. When they do, they often try to lead the rituals, bickering with Night Hags about every details, which they have an especially hard time to get along with.

Supposedly, they are born of eggs laid by roosters consorting with other roosters, the eggs must then be incubated for forty-four days by a toad. Asserting such claims proves difficult at best. Scholars cannot help but notice the similarity with their smaller cousins and instead theorize that the great cockatrice is the true form of the species, while the more common variation a diminished, flawed, subspecies. Great cockatrices do lay eggs of their own, but for some puzzling reason, only small cockatrices ever hatch from them. Regardless, the eggs hold great value as alchemical components, for they are the prime ingredient of an ointment that can cure petrification.": "大鸡冠花是一种大型生物，有野兽的身体，有公鸡的头和腿。据称，它们是由公鸡与其他公鸡交配所产的蛋所生，然后蛋必须由一只蟾蜍孵化44天。事实证明，这种说法充其量是困难的。学者们不能不注意到与它们较小的表亲的相似性，而是理论上认为大鸡冠花是该物种的真正形式，而更常见的变种是一个缩小的、有缺陷的亚种。大凤头鹦鹉确实自己产蛋，但由于一些令人费解的原因，只有小凤头鹦鹉才会从蛋中孵化出来。不管怎么说，这些蛋作为炼金成分具有很大的价值，因为它们是一种可以治疗石化的软膏的主要成分。",
	"Great cockatrices are extremely aggressive, attacking anything that comes in their sight with furious cackles, even without any provocation. These omnivores have a diet that consists of large quantities of berries, corns, fruits, and animals such as cattle, deer and the occasional lost shepherd. If left unchecked, they also greatly appreciate feasting in orchards, corn fields or any place where food is abundant. Cockatrices thrive in dark caves, abandoned ruins, cobwebbed dungeons and old basements. Though small compared to griffins and manticores, they are more than capable of killing anyone who stumbles across them in a dark corridor.": "大鸡冠花的攻击性极强，即使没有任何挑衅，也会用愤怒的叫声攻击任何进入它们视线的东西。这些杂食动物的食物包括大量的浆果、玉米、水果和动物，如牛、鹿和偶尔丢失的牧羊人。如果不加控制，它们也非常喜欢在果园、玉米地或任何食物丰富的地方大吃特吃。凤头鹦鹉在黑暗的洞穴、废弃的废墟、有蜘蛛网的地牢和旧地下室中茁壮成长。虽然与狮鹫和尾兽相比，它们的体型较小，但它们更有能力杀死任何在黑暗的走廊里偶然发现它们的人。",
	"Folktales claim that cockatrices hate everything that lives so fiercely that its glance turns the living to stone. This is not actually true, but the eyes of the beast can paralyze anyone that look at it, which might be where the confusion in the myth is coming from. However, one should watch out for its sharp beak which carries the murderous effect, turning a man into stone with a simple scratch. It is also thought that a cockatrice will die instantly upon hearing a rooster crow, which is pure nonsense, but the cockatrice seems to hate the sound nonetheless.": "民间故事称，鸡冠花对一切有生命的东西都恨之入骨，以至于它的目光把活人变成了石头。这实际上不是真的，但这种野兽的眼睛可以使任何看到它的人瘫痪，这可能是神话中的混乱之处。然而，人们应该注意它那锋利的喙，它有杀人的效果，只要轻轻一抓就能把人变成石头。还有人认为，鸡冠花听到公鸡打鸣就会立即死亡，这纯属无稽之谈，但鸡冠花似乎还是讨厌这种声音。",
	"Cockatrices do not shun direct fights, in which they strike furiously with wings and tail in an attempt to exhaust their foes. However, the cockatrice isn't a stupid adversary, it is quite aware of the chaos its gaze and its beak can cause in a fight.

	"The cockatrice has an irrational hatred for the rooster's crow. The song of the bird will make it mad with anger and the creature will charge in the direction of the noise, furiously cackling its discontentment and ravaging anything that stands in its path. For this reason, villages around a cockatrice hunting ground tend to have no chicken, for fear of angering the monster. Clever adventurers can use this hatred to their advantage, forcing the monster to show on a battlefield of their choice or distracting it during a fight.": "鸡冠花对公鸡的鸣叫有一种非理性的憎恨。公鸡的歌声会让它愤怒得发狂，这种生物会向声音的方向冲去，愤怒地叫着它的不满，蹂躏任何挡在它面前的东西。由于这个原因，鸡冠花狩猎地周围的村庄往往没有鸡，因为害怕激怒这个怪物。聪明的冒险家们可以利用这种仇恨的优势，迫使怪物出现在他们选择的战场上，或者在战斗中分散它的注意力。",

	"Griffins were once only found high in the mountains, where they would hunt marmots and wild goats. When humans encroached on their lands, however, griffins soon discovered a new source of much more plentiful and easier-caught prey: cows, sheep and shepherds, though they are still wary of main roads and towns (where fold with the means to hire a party of adventurers are likely to dwell). Griffins prefer their meat raw and screaming, though they'll scavenge if no other prey presents itself. This is fairly rare, though, as their hunting grounds tend to range for hundreds of miles around their chosen mountain aerie. Their eyesight is a sharp as raptors and they can see motion from miles away.": "狮鹫曾经只在高山上被发现，它们会在那里猎杀旱獭和野山羊。然而，当人类侵占它们的土地时，狮鹫很快就发现了一个新的来源，那就是牛、羊和牧羊人，尽管它们仍然对主要道路和城镇（有能力雇佣冒险者队伍的人可能会居住在那里）保持警惕。狮鹫喜欢吃生的和尖叫的肉，不过如果没有其他猎物出现，它们也会去搜刮。但这是相当罕见的，因为他们的狩猎场往往在他们选择的山地小窝周围数百英里的范围内。它们的视力和猛禽一样敏锐，可以看到几英里外的运动。",
	"Griffins are often mistaken for the smaller griffon, which whom they share general features with. They are also significantly larger and stronger than the classic griffon, their lesser cousin. Their bone structure differ as well, with a morphology more akin to that of a wyvern, having long feathery wings ending with deadly claws. It is impossible to tame a griffin in the way griffons can be, for they are far more cunning and rebellious, with a strong sense of vengeance and grief. Skilled and efficient fighters, griffins do not kill indiscriminately, although they show no reluctance when hunting or protecting their territory. They are fierce and merciless, but rarely cruel.": "狮鹫经常被误认为是较小的狮鹫，它们与狮鹫有着共同的特征。它们也明显比传统的狮鹫更大更强壮，是它们较小的表亲。它们的骨骼结构也不同，其形态更类似于狼獾，有长长的羽毛翅膀，末端是致命的爪子。要像狮鹫那样驯服狮鹫是不可能的，因为它们更加狡猾和叛逆，有强烈的复仇和悲痛意识。熟练而高效的战士，狮鹫不会胡乱杀戮，尽管它们在狩猎或保护自己的领地时表现出毫不勉强的态度。它们凶猛而无情，但很少残忍。",
	"Griffins, to the contrary of griffons, are solitary creatures. Until they reach full maturity they live in isolated territories and do not interact with other members of their species. Once they are ready they find a mate to found a nest, and stay loyal for life to their partner, raising their young together. There is nothing worse than a griffin that lost its partner, for they will slaughter everything they encounter, mad with grief. The eggs, claws and feathers of griffins are frequently use as spell components for they carry strong healing abilities. It is said that the feather, or claw in some tales, of a griffin will turn black if exposed to poison, a property that most king would find appealing for their safety.": "狮鹫，与狮鹫相反，是一种独居动物。在它们达到完全成熟之前，它们生活在孤立的领土上，不与其他物种的成员交往。一旦它们准备好了，它们就会找到一个伴侣，建立一个巢穴，并终生忠于它们的伴侣，共同抚养它们的孩子。没有什么比失去伴侣的狮鹫更糟糕的了，因为它们会屠杀它们遇到的一切，悲痛得发狂。狮鹫的蛋、爪子和羽毛经常被用作法术组件，因为它们具有强大的治疗能力。据说狮鹫的羽毛，或在一些故事中的爪子，如果接触到毒药，就会变成黑色，大多数国王会发现这种特性对他们的安全有吸引力。",
	"Survivors of griffin attacks often have dreams of being hunted down and rent limb from limb for years afterward. Despite being large and monstrous creatures, griffins have reputations as noble beasts. This is in part due to their proud and regal bearing griffins are not ravenous and frenetic like manticores. Instead a griffin strikes with swift and precise grace, its motion poised and controlled. Yet this elegance in no way undermines its deadliness, for a griffin is more than capable of using its talons and razor beak to rip a foe apart. The cry of a griffin is often enough to send enemies running. For the griffin, this is an ideal situation as it prefers its meals on the run, and alive. They can roar at such a high pitch that even a grown man can be put off balance. From the sky, griffins try to repeatedly claw their targets as they sweep past, or attempt to dive and grab their prey, leading it to a deadly fall.": "被狮鹫袭击的幸存者经常会梦见自己被追杀，并在之后的几年里四肢被撕裂。尽管狮鹫是大型的畸形生物，但它却被誉为高贵的野兽。这部分是由于它们的骄傲和威严，狮鹫不像尾兽那样贪婪和狂热。相反，狮鹫以迅速而精确的优雅姿态出击，它的动作有条不紊，控制得很好。然而，这种优雅丝毫不影响它的致命性，因为狮鹫更有能力用它的爪子和剃刀嘴将敌人撕碎。狮鹫的叫声往往足以让敌人逃跑。对于狮鹫来说，这是一个理想的情况，因为它更喜欢在奔跑中的食物，而且是活的。它们能以如此高的音调咆哮，甚至能让一个成年男子失去平衡。在天空中，狮鹫试图在掠过目标时反复抓取，或者试图俯冲并抓住猎物，导致猎物致命地坠落。",
	"Especially feared are the subspecies known as royal griffins or archgriffins. Royal griffins owe their name to the broad and thick mane that surrounds their head.

	"Archgriffins represent a real threat for civilization, for they are not afraid to hunt in small towns and trade routes, where preys, people mostly, are abundant. Royal griffins have few natural predators and are not afraid to attack preys bigger than them, sometimes even hunting gigantic roc birds, small dragons or giants for sustenance. Surprisingly the feathers of a royal griffin makes it immune to extreme temperatures, allowing it to live under the searing sun of the desert or in arctic climate.": "大狮鹫对文明来说是一个真正的威胁，因为它们并不害怕在小城镇和贸易路线上捕猎，那里的猎物，主要是人，非常丰富。皇家狮鹫的天敌很少，而且不怕攻击比它们大的猎物，有时甚至猎杀巨大的大鹏鸟、小龙或巨人来维持生计。令人惊讶的是，皇家狮鹫的羽毛使其对极端温度具有免疫力，使其能够生活在沙漠的灼热阳光下或北极气候中。",
	"Very few people know that griffin are nicknamed \"noble beast\" for a reason. Most think it refers to their natural grace or the king-mane of a royal griffin, but in truth griffins are susceptible to overt demonstration of respect. If one is unlucky enough to stumble on a griffin, one should not draw its sword but instead bow very low, pointing its eyes at the ground. If the beast isn't hungry and the gesture is properly executed the creature will answer with a singular bow of its wings, leaving the area peacefully. This of course bears a significant risk, for there is usually no sure way to tell if the beast fed recently or is in the right mood.": "很少有人知道，狮鹫被昵称为 \"高贵的野兽 \"是有原因的。大多数人认为这指的是它们天生的优雅或皇家狮鹫的王者风范，但事实上狮鹫很容易受到公开的尊敬。如果一个人不幸被狮鹫绊倒，就不应该拔出它的剑，而应该非常低地鞠躬，把眼睛对准地面。如果这只野兽不饿，而且这个手势执行得很好，那么它就会用它的翅膀做一个单一的鞠躬来回答，然后和平地离开这个地方。这当然有很大的风险，因为通常没有确定的方法来判断这只野兽最近是否吃过东西，或者是否有合适的心情。",

Workers will usually not attack a creature keeping its distance, unless they are on the hunt for the colony, in which case they will swarm mercilessly any prey they can detect.": "在Kikimores殖民地，工人是使蜂群的其他部分能够运作和繁荣的命脉。一个单独的工人甚至可以被一个弱者轻易杀死。然而，遇到一个孤立的个体确实很罕见，因为Kikimore工蚁通常以几人到十几人的团体形式活动。对于一个正常人来说，面对成群结队的Kikimores，唯一的防御手段就是逃跑。工蚁通常不会攻击保持距离的生物，除非它们是在为蚁群狩猎，在这种情况下，它们会毫不留情地蜂拥而上，攻击任何它们能发现的猎物。",
	"A kikimore warrior is a massive insectoid recovered by a protective chitinous exoskeleton. Kikimore warriors defend the workers and the kikimore queen from intruders. They are very dutiful in this, killing anything that comes near the colony. Their hardy build and venomous bite allows them to stand against any foe, and should the enemy attack from afar, they can dig underground, protected until they reach it. Kikimore workers react to pheromones emitted by kikimore warriors. On command, a swarm of workers might begin burrowing tunnels near potential prey to allow for a surprise mass attack. However, if the warrior guiding a swarm is eliminated, the swarm will disperse and the workers cease digging. Other creatures exposed to kikimore warrior pheromones will react aggressively, attacking allies and foes at random.": "Kikimore战士是一个巨大的昆虫体，由保护性的几丁质外骨骼复原。Kikimore战士保护工人和Kikimore女王免受入侵者的伤害。它们在这方面非常尽责，杀死任何接近蚁群的东西。它们坚韧的身材和毒液的咬合使它们能够抵御任何敌人，如果敌人从远处进攻，它们可以在地下挖掘，在到达之前受到保护。Kikimore工人对Kikimore战士发出的信息素作出反应。根据命令，一群工人可能开始在潜在的猎物附近挖掘隧道，以便进行突然的大规模攻击。然而，如果指导虫群的战士被消灭了，虫群就会散开，工人就会停止挖掘。其他接触到基姆尔战士信息素的生物会做出积极的反应，随机攻击盟友和敌人。",
	"Kikimore Queens are amongst the largest and most formidable insectoid breeds to ever plague the world, so large and terrifying that she can beat a giant prey into submission and dig entire networks of spacious tunnels in a region. Growing larger than a townhouse, these kikimores are an ancient species that had lived below the ground long before the arrival of mankind, where she was said to stalk and entrap whole herds of deep rothé and umber hulk into its ravenous mouth, or fight and kill larger prey such as fomorians in single combat. With civilization flourishing over time, the echoes of life reached to the kikimore's deep burrows, intriguing the queens as to what might cause such promising ruckus.": "Kikimore女王是有史以来困扰世界的最大和最可怕的昆虫品种之一，她是如此巨大和可怕，以至于她可以把一个巨大的猎物打得服服帖帖，并在一个地区挖掘整个宽敞的隧道网络。这些kikimores长得比一栋联排别墅还大，是一个古老的物种，早在人类到来之前就已经生活在地下了，据说她在那里跟踪并将整群的深红和黄褐色的大块头困在它贪婪的嘴里，或者在单打独斗中对抗并杀死更大的猎物，如fomorians。随着文明的蓬勃发展，生命的回声传到了Kikimore的深洞里，让女王们好奇，是什么引起了如此有希望的骚动。",
	"Life in a kikimore colony is centered around a great, unceasingly procreating female. The queen bears more resemblance to the soldiers, mainly because of her bulky body. She is a mass of insect abominations with no eyes, which would be useless at the bottom of her dark lair. The pieces of flesh that resemble ribs and hang from her abdomen can either be ovipositors or atrophied limbs that have no use in her function as a constant reproducer.

Immune to human steel, it is believed the leshen is nature's way of protecting the forest and the animals that live within it from the threat humans started to pose upon their ravaging expansion deeper into the lands. Sometimes called leshii or leszi, leshens are ancient and powerful forest spirits. Possessing a deer skull as a head and tree-like limbs, the sight of a leshen is a terrifying one.

	"A leshen will turn nature itself against those that trespass on his lands. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within their territory and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Animals, even timid and harmless ones, will be taken by a frenzy that will only stop with the death of the intruders, attacking on sight anyone they cross path with. Roots will sprout from the ground, trying to grapple, crush and strangle the unwary, burying them into deep earthy tombs, never to be seen again.": "雷神会将大自然本身用来对付那些闯入他的土地的人。他们用与生俱来的魔力来控制其领地内的植物和动物，因此在跟踪他们时，一半的战斗只是为了接近他们，以进行攻击。动物，即使是胆小和无害的动物，也会被一种狂热所吸引，只有在入侵者死亡后才会停止，它们会对任何与之相交的人进行攻击。根系会从地面长出，试图抓住、压碎和勒死不小心的人，将他们埋入深土中，再也看不到了。",
	"Thankfully, it's difficult to unknowingly stumble into the territory of a leshen. The borders of its charge are warded with totems made of roots, stones, plants and animal bones, hanging from trees or stacked on mounds. One may also have to destroy a leshen's warding totems to rid a forest of its presence. The totems are the eyes and ears of the leshen throughout the forest and crossing or destroying one is a sure way to declare war on the creature. leshens are also known to be able to appear and disappear unexpectedly near their totems.": "值得庆幸的是，你很难在不知情的情况下闯入莱森的领地。它所管辖的边界用树根、石头、植物和动物骨头制成的图腾来守护，这些图腾挂在树上或堆在土丘上。人们也可能不得不摧毁莱森的守护图腾，以摆脱它在森林中的存在。图腾是Leshen在整个森林中的眼睛和耳朵，越过或破坏一个图腾肯定会向该生物宣战。Leshens也被称为能够在其图腾附近意外出现和消失。",

Some call them the Old Gods, and believe they were here before the divinities even existed. In some small and rural communities, especially the ones far from major trade routes and industrious cities, the leshen is the only god recognized by the villagers and the glade under his protection is considered sacred ground.

A black root was created by a night hag or a crone. By kidnapping a child from a village, trapping him into a tree trunk inside the leshen's lair and letting him starve to death there, a crone can corrupt a leshen with her magic.

The inhabitants of forest villages fear them, and animals give their nests a wide berth.

When nekkers venture out as a war or hunting party, they are led by thornhearts, their prophets and leaders. Thornhearts give orders, turning a wild band into an organized unit, thus they should be eliminated first. As malicious as they are, nekkers are cowardly creatures by nature and will not hesitate to flee if too many of them are slaughtered or an opponent seems too dangerous.

Nobody knows who the Lady really was and what happened to her. None have heard of her in centuries, still, the nekkers remain, doing her biding.": "传说中，NEKKERS曾经是温柔俏皮的精灵，安静地生活在阿卡迪亚王国。一个强大的大精灵，只被称为 \"荆棘女士\"，扭曲了他们的整个种族，把他们变成了今天这样凶恶和讨厌的生物。夫人利用nekker来寻找和欺骗有魔法火花的孩子，让他们游荡到精灵世界，再也没有人看到。有些人说夫人是个老妪或巫婆，以儿童为食来维持自己的生命，其他传说则假装她是干尸女王。没有人知道这位女士到底是谁，她发生了什么。几个世纪以来，没有人听说过她的消息，但是，纽克尔人仍然存在，为她效劳。",
	"A lone nekker is harmless. Five are dangerous. Ten can kill even a veteran monster slayer. Individual nekkers are weak, easy marks compared to other monsters; Nekkers do not tend to fight as individuals. One must be ready to repel many foes at once. If you see one, expect anywhere from 2-10 more. They burrow from beneath the ground or fall from trees and swarm upon their prey. Though primitive, the tactic is surprisingly effective. Nekkers overwhelm their targets through sheer numbers, surrounding them, then pummeling and clawing victims to death. Even veteran adventurers can fall prey to this. When facing large groups of nekkers, it is best to take advantage of tactics that can harm several opponents at once, such as spells and explosives that can help thin out the swarm with ease. As with other agile creatures, running from nekkers is not the best idea, for the monsters will catch up to their prey and swiftly kill it with multiple hits of their claws.": "一个孤独的nekker是无害的。五个是危险的。十个甚至可以杀死一个资深的怪物杀手。与其他怪物相比，单个的nekkers是脆弱的，容易被击中；nekkers不倾向于作为个体进行战斗。人们必须准备好同时击退许多敌人。如果你看到一个，预计会有2-10个。它们从地底下钻出来，或者从树上掉下来，一窝蜂地扑向它们的猎物。虽然很原始，但这种战术却出奇地有效。蛇人通过纯粹的数量压倒它们的目标，包围它们，然后用爪子拍打受害者，使之死亡。即使是老练的冒险家也会成为这种情况的牺牲品。当面对大群的霓虹灯时，最好利用可以同时伤害几个对手的战术，比如法术和爆炸物，它们可以帮助轻松地疏散蜂群。与其他敏捷的生物一样，逃避霓虹灯并不是最好的办法，因为这些怪物会追上它们的猎物，用它们的爪子多次击打，迅速将其杀死。",
	"Particularly troublesome are the larger, stronger individuals known as warriors, a rarer breed of nekkers. Nekker warriors are a larger version of the nekker and typically distinguished by their red-painted faces. Nekker warriors support their smaller companions when they prepare an attack or ambush.": "特别麻烦的是那些被称为勇士的更大、更强壮的个体，他们是Nekkers中比较罕见的品种。霓虹灯战士是霓虹灯的一个较大版本，通常以其涂有红色的脸来区分。当他们准备进攻或伏击时，Nekker战士会支持他们较小的同伴。",
	"Phoocas are a strange breed of nekker that seem to have an irrational hatred for every creature with a spark of magic, to the exception of thornhearts that they revere like prophets. They are fierce hunters and have the ability to drain the energy from spells, leaving spellcasters vulnerable to their vicious claws. Phoocas paint their body in dark green or brown colors, while practicing some sort of ritual scarification, piercing their skin with razorvine thorns.": "Phoocas是一个奇怪的nekker品种，他们似乎对每一个有魔法火花的生物都有一种非理性的憎恨，除了他们像先知一样崇敬的刺猬之外。他们是凶猛的猎手，并有能力耗尽法术的能量，使施法者在他们凶恶的爪子面前变得脆弱。菲奥卡人将自己的身体涂成深绿色或棕色，同时进行某种仪式性的结疤，用剃刀刺刺穿自己的皮肤。",
	"Phoocas are somewhat the magpies of the nekkers; they steal any magic item they can get their hands on, going to great length and danger to acquire them. They always bring their prize deep inside the nekker's burrow, offering it reverently to thornhearts. Mages learn to protect their studies against these intruders, for hiring parties of adventurers to recover prized possessions becomes quickly more than an annoyance.": "Phoocas在某种程度上是nekkers中的喜鹊；他们偷窃任何他们能搞到的魔法物品，不惜一切代价和危险来获取它们。他们总是把他们的战利品带到nekkker的洞穴深处，把它恭敬地献给刺客。法师们要学会保护他们的研究免受这些入侵者的影响，因为雇佣冒险者的队伍来找回珍贵的财产很快就会成为一种烦恼。",
	"During rare astrological events, when the barrier between the Feywild and the Material world is thinning, the nekkers will venture into settlements, led by phoocas, looking for children with the spark of magic in them. Tragedies usually follow, as the nekkers swarm slaughters the entire village and every mage, priest or druid they can find. The children found are taken to the Thorn Garden, a fey crossing at the deepest point of the nekker's burrow, filled with deadly razorvines. During a strange ceremony, the heart of the children are pierced with a Thornshard, one of the many magical thorns that used to be part of the Lady of Thorn's dress, a sacred item for the nekkers. The ones that survive turn into nekkers known as thornhearts, wielding a fraction of the Lady's power.": "在罕见的星象事件中，当仙界和物质世界之间的屏障变薄时，nekkers会在phoocas的带领下冒险进入定居点，寻找身上有魔法火花的孩子。悲剧通常接踵而至，因为蛇人蜂拥而至，屠杀了整个村庄和他们能找到的所有法师、牧师或德鲁伊。被发现的孩子们被带到荆棘花园，这是一个位于霓虹灯洞穴最深处的精灵通道，充满了致命的剃刀藤。在一个奇怪的仪式中，孩子们的心脏被荆棘刺穿，荆棘刺是许多神奇的荆棘之一，曾经是荆棘女士衣服的一部分，是尼科尔人的神圣物品。活下来的人变成了被称为 \"刺心 \"的蛇人，挥舞着夫人的一小部分力量。",
	"Thornhearts are seen as prophets and heralds by the nekkers, revered as priests of the Lady. They are thought to one day find again the Lady of Thorn. Thornhearts are larger and have more expressive faces than regular nekkers, akin to the innocent face of a child. The thorn in their heart is clearly visible, pulsating with magic. They have some basic understanding of fate magic, wielding a form of raw primitive power. These abilities makes them natural leaders of their race, channeling their inner strength to inspire their cowardly kin to daring feats. Thornhearts often wear jewelry made of bones & razorvines, and mark their faces with blue and green pigments.": "Thornhearts被nekkers视为先知和使者，被尊称为夫人的祭司。他们被认为有一天会再次找到荆棘夫人。荆棘之心比普通的尼亚克人更大，脸部表情更丰富，类似于孩子的天真面孔。他们心中的刺是清晰可见的，带着魔力跳动。他们对命运魔法有一些基本了解，挥舞着一种原始的力量。这些能力使他们成为他们种族的天然领袖，引导他们内在的力量来激励他们胆小的亲属进行大胆的壮举。荆棘之心经常佩戴由骨头和剃刀藤制成的首饰，并在他们的脸上涂上蓝色和绿色的颜料。",
	"A thornheart lair is located deep underground, after a maze of tunnels and caves leading to a place called the Thorn Garden, a crossing to the Feywild surrounded by deadly razorvine and beautiful eerie lights.": "荆棘之心的巢穴位于地下深处，经过迷宫般的隧道和洞穴，通向一个叫荆棘花园的地方，这是一个通往费城的路口，周围有致命的剃刀藤和美丽的阴森灯光。",
	"Lost in the wilderness, in the most secluded places of the world, one can meet creatures that have never felt the touch of civilisation. Primal and savage, these beasts are empowered by the ancient magic of the leshens, landvaettirs and other powerful spiritual entities. When nature needs to defend its land, the primal beasts are its champions, fighting restlessly with tooth, claws and talons.": "在世界最隐蔽的地方，迷失在荒野中，人们可以见到从未感受过文明的生物。这些野兽原始而野蛮，它们被Leshens、Landvaettirs和其他强大的精神实体的古老魔法赋予了力量。当大自然需要保卫它的土地时，原始的野兽是它的冠军，用牙齿、爪子和利爪不安地战斗。",
	"The primal beasts embody the perfection of their species. They are flawless predators, perfect hunters of the wild, honed over millenias of evolution in places untouched by the pestilence of men. Only the strongest of their kind survived to nowadays. They come from an era where wild beast were ruling the land or from planes were they run in endless hunts, such as the Feywild or the Outer Plane of the Beastlands.": "原始的野兽体现了其物种的完美性。它们是完美的捕食者，完美的野外猎手，在未受人类瘟疫影响的地方经过几千年的进化而磨练。只有最强壮的同类才能存活到今天。他们来自野兽统治土地的时代，或者来自他们在无尽的狩猎中奔跑的星球，如Feywild或Beastlands的外部星球。",
	"Pacts were sealed long ago between the beasts and the protectors of the lands. When druids, fey or rangers are about to give their lives to protect the land, the beasts will head their call and assist them into battle. When called through magic the beasts will serve for a time, understanding the necessity to put their hunt aside to partake in the greater good.": "野兽和土地的保护者之间很久以前就签订了契约。当德鲁伊、费伊或游侠要为保护土地而献出生命时，野兽会听从他们的召唤并协助他们战斗。当通过魔法召唤时，魔兽会服务一段时间，理解把他们的狩猎放在一边以参与更大的利益的必要性。",
	"The creatures introduced in this section can all be summoned by the {@spell conjure fey} spell. As long as the caster can expand a spell slot of a level high enough to match the challenge rating of the primal beast.": "本节介绍的生物都能被{@spell conjure fey}法术召唤出来。只要施法者能展开一个级别足够高的法术槽，以匹配原始兽的挑战等级。",
	"Course it reeks. Think they're called rotfiends because they smell like roses?": "当然，它很臭。你认为他们被称为腐臭动物是因为他们闻起来像玫瑰吗？",
	"What rotfiends are, everyone can see. Even seeing them is not necessary, as hearing their name should be enough to tell anyone what creatures might bear this unpleasant title. Rotfiends resemble decomposing human bodies that have been mostly stripped of their skin. Their presence is given away by the overwhelming stench of rot which gives them their name.": "腐尸是什么，每个人都能看到。即使看到它们也没有必要，因为听到它们的名字就足以告诉任何人什么生物可能拥有这个令人不快的称号。腐尸类似于腐烂的人体，大部分已经被剥去了皮肤。它们的存在是由铺天盖地的腐烂臭味引起的，这就是它们的名字。",
	"Similar to ghouls, rotfiends roam in packs. Rotfiends are undead, so usual tactics against this kind of creature might apply. Common poisons, on the other hand, are useless - the beasts have gained immunity to these by devouring carcasses. Killing a rotfiend is not difficult, yet one must remember to survive the moment of the beast's death, for the monster's corpse releases explosive fumes a mere spark could ignite. The resulting explosion can easily kill an adventurer, but it might also kill nearby rotfiends, creating something of a chain reaction. Thus, a dying monster should be drawn away from its kin.": "与食尸鬼相似，腐尸也是成群结队地游荡。腐尸是不死之身，所以对付这种生物的常规战术可能适用。另一方面，普通的毒药是没有用的--这些野兽通过吞噬尸体获得了免疫力。杀死腐尸并不困难，但必须记住要在野兽死亡的那一刻活下来，因为怪物的尸体会释放出爆炸性的烟雾，只要有火花就能点燃。由此产生的爆炸可以轻易杀死一个冒险者，但它也可能杀死附近的腐尸，产生一些连锁反应。因此，一个垂死的怪物应该远离它的亲属。",
	"Backed against a wall, a rotfiend flies into a fury, attacking madly. This attack should be evaded, for the beast's chaotic blows carry a strength that can only be called hysterical. Running is never a good idea when fighting rotfiends, as the creatures will pursue its foe, jump on its back, knock it down and overwhelm it. Stopping rotfiends from escaping can be difficult as they try to burrow into the ground.": "背靠着墙，一只腐尸飞快地发起了怒火，疯狂地攻击。这种攻击应该被回避，因为这只野兽的混乱打击带有一种只能被称为歇斯底里的力量。在与腐尸搏斗时，奔跑绝不是一个好主意，因为这种生物会追赶它的敌人，跳到它的背上，把它打倒并压倒它。阻止腐尸逃跑可能很困难，因为它们试图钻入地下。",
	"Many academies throughout the world have studied the remains of rotfiends, hoping to explain their sudden and recurrent return. They have yet to find the answer to their question but one troubling fact might lead them on the right path: the corrupted tissues of the undead always reveal the presence of the flesh rot disease. Most concluded that the two phenomena are inherently connected: a flesh rot outburst is followed by a resurgence of rotfiends and rotfiend infestations are always followed by numerous cases of the disease.": "世界各地的许多学院都研究过腐尸的遗体，希望能解释它们突然和反复出现的回归。他们还没有找到问题的答案，但一个令人不安的事实可能会引导他们走上正确的道路：亡灵的腐烂组织总是显示出肉腐病的存在。大多数人得出结论，这两种现象有内在的联系：肉腐病爆发后，腐尸就会重新出现，而腐尸侵袭后，总是会出现大量的疾病病例。",
	"Alternatively, a creature that takes damage from a rotfiend must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, contracting the flesh rot disease on failure, as per the contagion spell.": "另外，受到腐尸伤害的生物必须做一个DC13的宪法救赎，如果失败就会感染肉体腐烂症，就像传染法术一样。",
	"Rotfiends and devourers were once rarities, but in age of constant warfare and violence they can become a veritable plague, as they feed on carrion and human corpses, particularly around battlefields, near cities afflicted by plague, or around villages touched by famine. They appear of a sudden, and disappear even more quickly if threatened, so exterminating them is difficult. They are best dealt with by cutting off their food supply, which is, burning all corpses in the area. Corpses must be incinerated rather than buried, for rotfiends are avid and skillful diggers. Without sustenance, the beasts will leave in search of new feeding ground. See a rotfiend and you can be sure there are many more in the area. They usually feed in large groups and thus present a danger to lone travelers especially considering their speed, which can be more than a match for a horse at full gallop. Rotfiends and devourers feed in the twilight hours and at night, when they become much more dangerous than during the day.": "腐尸和吞噬者曾经是罕见的，但在战争和暴力不断的时代，它们可以成为名副其实的瘟疫，因为它们以腐肉和人类尸体为食，特别是在战场周围、受瘟疫影响的城市附近或受饥荒影响的村庄周围。它们突然出现，如果受到威胁，会更快地消失，所以消灭它们很困难。对付它们最好的办法是切断它们的食物供应，也就是焚烧该地区的所有尸体。尸体必须被焚烧而不是埋葬，因为腐尸是狂热而熟练的挖掘者。没有食物，这些野兽就会离开，去寻找新的觅食地。看到一个腐尸，你可以肯定在这个地区还有很多。它们通常成群结队地进食，因此对孤独的旅行者来说是一种危险，特别是考虑到它们的速度，可以比全速奔跑的马更快。腐尸和吞噬者在黄昏时分和夜间进食，这时它们变得比白天更加危险。",
	"A rotfiend doesn't require air, drink or sleep.": "腐尸不需要空气、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Devourers are a particularly dangerous kind of rotfiend marked by an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Most folktales on rotfied suggest that once a rotfiend tasted the flesh of a living humanoid it will turn into a devourer, craving the flesh of the living rather that of the dead.": "吞噬者是一种特别危险的腐尸，它的特点是对人肉贪得无厌的胃口。大多数关于腐尸的民间故事表明，一旦腐尸尝到了活人的肉，它就会变成吞噬者，渴望吃活人的肉而不是死人的肉。",
	"There is no distinguishable hierarchy in the rotfiend pack, but devourers are without question the best at finding and digging corpses, and so the rest of the pack follows them wherever they go.": "腐尸群中没有明显的等级制度，但吞噬者毫无疑问是最善于寻找和挖掘尸体的人，因此其他的人无论走到哪里都会跟着他们。",
	"Scurvers are rotfiends' larger cousins. The bodies of these hideous, vaguely humanoid creatures are covered in rotten scraps of flesh, under which lurk even more rotten muscles stretched around a strong, flexible skeleton. Scurvers, which feed on old, rotting corpses, prefer to make their hunting grounds in abandoned torture sites, forgotten graveyards, and old battlefields. They are very aggressive and, though they feed on corpses, if they come across a living person they are likely to attack.": "Scurvers是腐尸的大型表亲。这些狰狞的、模糊的人形生物的身体上覆盖着腐烂的肉屑，肉屑下潜藏着更多腐烂的肌肉，伸展在强壮而灵活的骨架周围。以陈旧腐烂的尸体为食的Scurvers喜欢在废弃的酷刑场所、被遗忘的墓地和旧战场上进行狩猎。它们非常具有攻击性，尽管它们以尸体为食，但如果遇到活人，它们很可能会进行攻击。",
	"Scurvers usually feed underground, but sometimes, when they catch the scent of a human, they crawl to the surface in a matter of seconds and attack their potential prey. While fighting them one cannot afford to forget about their special boney spines, razor sharp protuberances sticking out from their skeletons. When a scurver is near death, the gasses and enzymes gathered within its body cause it to explode, flinging these spines out at great speed, turning them into one last deadly weapon in their arsenal.": "Scurvers通常在地下觅食，但有时，当它们捕捉到人类的气味时，它们会在几秒钟内爬到地面上，攻击它们潜在的猎物。在与它们战斗时，人们不能忘记它们特殊的骨刺，即从它们的骨骼中伸出的锐利突起。当斯库弗濒临死亡时，聚集在其体内的气体和酶会使其爆炸，并以极快的速度将这些刺甩出去，将它们变成它们武器库中最后的致命武器。",
	"After several lifetimes dedicated to the pursuit of pleasure and having visited the four corners of the world, some ancient satyrs grow tired of the life of a wayfarer and retreat deep into the Feywild. Wiser from their numerous experiences and travels, they take to a life of quiet and contemplation, appreciating the simple beauty of life after the unceasing chaos of their younger years. Almost instinctively, some undertake a spiritual journey through the remote parts of the plane. Their path leads them to a place of secret wonders the amber spring. There, they commune with the spirits of eternal treants, drinking from the spring of liquid amber and falling into a decades long slumber, sheltered in a cocoon of amber. Some never wake up, sleeping forever amidst the treants, others awake from their cocoon with renewed purpose, size and strength.": "一些古老的萨提尔在为追求快乐奉献了几辈子并走遍了世界的各个角落之后，厌倦了流浪者的生活，退缩到仙境深处。在无数次的经历和旅行中，他们变得更加聪明，开始了安静和沉思的生活，在经历了年轻时不断的混乱之后，欣赏生活的简单之美。几乎是本能地，一些人在飞机的偏远地区进行了一次精神旅行。他们的道路将他们引向一个充满秘密奇迹的地方--琥珀泉。在那里，他们与永恒的树人的灵魂交流，喝下琥珀液的泉水，然后在琥珀的茧中陷入几十年的沉睡。有些人永远不会醒来，永远沉睡在树人之中，有些人从茧中醒来，有了新的目标、体型和力量。",
	"Touched by the primeval spirits of the Feywild, amber fathers take on the role of revered elders in satyr gatherings and encourage them to protect natural places. As they only ever reach few satyrs, they often take personally a more active role in the safekeeping of magical places, assuring they stay pure and outside of the reach of malevolent forces. To fulfil their calling, they rely on the verses of rebirth, an ancient invigorating litany taught by the spirits and magical amber beads. With this song of hope and life they tend the wounds of the land, traveling to places ravaged by war, magic calamities and curses. As they heal the land in their travel, so do they gift it with protectors, mighty treants, awoken by their song and given form by the amber.": "琥珀之父被精灵世界的原始精神所感动，在萨提尔集会中扮演着受人尊敬的长者的角色，鼓励他们保护自然场所。由于他们只接触到少数萨提尔，所以他们经常亲自在魔法场所的安全保护方面发挥更积极的作用，确保它们保持纯净，不受邪恶力量的影响。为了完成他们的使命，他们依靠重生的诗句，这是一种古老的、由神灵和神奇的琥珀珠教导的振奋人心的诗句。带着这首希望和生命之歌，他们照顾着土地的伤口，前往被战争、魔法灾难和诅咒蹂躏的地方。当他们在旅行中治愈土地时，他们也给土地带来了保护者，强大的树人，被他们的歌声唤醒，被琥珀赋予形式。",
	"Amber fathers can usually be found traveling the world, just like younger satyrs do. They listen for stories of war or disasters, questioning travelers to learn where their gift might be needed. Many entertain friendly relationships with druidic organizations and temples dedicated to the protection of nature, including farming communities. In the Feywild, they occasionally frequent the Summer Court, sometimes tending to the wonderful gardens and palaces, growing their magical amber into the intricate architectural designs and sculptures, but have no interest in the intrigues that constantly unfold within the Court itself.": "琥珀之父通常可以在世界范围内找到，就像年轻的萨提尔一样。他们倾听战争或灾难的故事，询问旅行者以了解哪里可能需要他们的天赋。许多人与德鲁伊组织和致力于保护自然的寺庙保持友好关系，包括农业社区。在翡冷翠，他们偶尔会去夏日宫廷，有时会去打理那些美妙的花园和宫殿，把他们神奇的琥珀植入复杂的建筑设计和雕塑中，但对宫廷内不断展开的阴谋没有兴趣。",
	"The lair of an amber father consists of a forested area that has benefited from its Verses of Rebirth in the past year. In such forest, golden spirits often appear out of the corner of the eye, vanishing a second later. An amber father encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 11 (7,200 XP).": "琥珀之父的巢穴由一片森林组成，在过去的一年中受益于其重生之诗。在这样的森林里，金色的灵魂经常从眼角出现，一秒钟后就消失了。在琥珀之父的巢穴中遇到的挑战等级为11（7,200XP）。",
	"Faun are coarse and selfish creatures, driven by self-interest. Nothing is sacred to them, they obscenely mock the gods and their temples. However, when their debauchery reaches epic proportions, one of them might step up, having an epiphany and gaining ambitions to become more than a simple faun, perhaps someday reaching the archfey status. These creatures are called bonfire kings or reveling lords, corpulent and lazy satyrs. Since these satyrs enjoy partaking of the fruits of others' labors without asking permission, men do not take to them kindly and at times, fooled by their awkward appearance, will try to solve this problem using force. This often ends in tragedy, for these satyr, despite their obesity, hide almost absurd amounts of physical strength and can call on dangerous magic.": "法恩人是粗俗而自私的生物，受自身利益的驱使。对他们来说，没有什么是神圣的，他们猥琐地嘲笑神和他们的神庙。然而，当他们的放荡达到史诗般的程度时，他们中的一个人可能会站出来，顿悟并获得野心，成为不只是一个简单的法恩，也许有一天会达到大帝的地位。这些生物被称为篝火之王或狂欢之主，肥胖而懒惰的萨提尔。由于这些萨提尔喜欢不经允许就分食他人的劳动成果，所以人们对他们并不友好，有时会被他们笨拙的外表所迷惑，试图用武力来解决这个问题。这往往以悲剧收场，因为这些萨提尔尽管肥胖，但却隐藏着近乎荒谬的体力，并能召唤出危险的魔法。",
	"Bonfire kings are egocentric above all else, nasty schemers seeing themselves as divine beings, entitled to rule over all fey and men. They cannot stand to be snubbed and demand worship from all they encounter. In such regard, they should be shown deference by all and will only speak with outsiders if a worthy offering is made. Lazy by nature, they would gladly spend every day in idleness, puffing on pipes, surrounded by concubines, gorging on rich foods and downing strong drinks. To honor a bonfire king, its faun devotees will erect large stones carvings, with somewhat grotesque and obscene features. At times, they can be found in barbarian tribes or small towns and villages, pushing them to embrace their savagery and cravings in grand orgies around totemic stones.": "篝火国王以自我为中心，把自己看作是神圣的存在，有权统治所有的精灵和人类。他们不能忍受被冷落，并要求所有他们遇到的人对他们进行崇拜。在这方面，他们应该得到所有人的尊重，并且只有在提供了有价值的礼物后才会与外人交谈。懒惰的天性使他们乐于每天无所事事，抽着烟斗，在妻妾的簇拥下，大吃特吃，喝着烈酒。为了纪念篝火之王，其动物信徒会竖起大石头雕刻，其特征有些怪异和淫秽。有时，他们可以在野蛮人部落或小城镇和村庄找到，推动他们在图腾石周围的盛大狂欢中拥抱野蛮和渴望。",
	"A bonfire king establishes his lair close to a settlement of intelligent creatures and place of magical significance, ideally a fey crossing. At the center of his lair stands a revelstone, a massive monolith surrounded by blazing bonfires.

	"Fauns resemble stout satyrs, displaying harsher bestial features and demeanors, with large and powerful antlers or horns. If satyrs crave luxury and refinery in their hedonism, fauns are viewed as their debased cousins, gluttons gorging on meat and wine, regardless of quality or taste. Depicted as lustful and wild, fauns love to play on the conflict between the lower appetites and civilized behavior in humankind. They can summon the basest urges in people, be it temper, sex or addiction. When meeting humanoids, they often require them to join in their revelry and orgies. Partaking can be quite dangerous, especially for creatures lacking the faun's stunning constitution, as they love to measure their personal strength and endurance in violent games, that often result in death. The Summer Court have banned any faun from entering its land, damning them too destructive and unrefined to step into their haughty kingdom. The Unseely court, for their part, only barely tolerates faun on the outskirt of society.": "兽人类似于粗壮的萨提尔，表现出更严酷的兽性特征和举止，拥有大而有力的鹿角或角。如果说萨提尔在享乐主义中渴望奢华和精炼，那么法恩则被看作是他们堕落的表亲，是大吃大喝的食客，不顾质量和口味。兽人被描述为好色和野性，喜欢玩弄人类的低级食欲和文明行为之间的冲突。他们能唤起人们最基本的冲动，无论是脾气、性还是瘾。当遇到人类时，他们经常要求他们加入他们的狂欢和狂欢。参加狂欢可能相当危险，特别是对于缺乏动物的惊人体质的生物，因为他们喜欢在暴力游戏中衡量他们的个人力量和耐力，这往往导致死亡。夏宫禁止任何动物进入它的土地，认为它们太有破坏性，不讲究，不能踏入他们高傲的王国。隐秘宫廷则只勉强容忍社会边缘的小动物。",
	"Fauns live in roving herds of various sizes, gathered around a chieftain. They love to barge in uninvited in banquets, weddings and any kind of celebration; wreaking havoc as they go. In lands with strong ties to the Feywild, it is common practice to leave food outside the village in hope to appease them or to ward off the place of celebration against fey interlopers. Fauns are always males but can and do breed with anything. In that regard they often prey on dryads and nymphs, but are also known to carry off brides and other women at weddings. The male offspring are always fauns. Fauns are believed to be originating from the curse of an archfey, cast onto a satyr as punishment for seducing its true love: \"May you look as beastly outside as you are inside, and may all that you sire suffer the same fate.\"": "妖怪们生活在大小不一的游牧群中，聚集在一个首领周围。他们喜欢不请自来地闯入宴会、婚礼和任何形式的庆祝活动；一边走一边搞破坏。在与精灵世界关系密切的地方，通常的做法是把食物留在村子外面，希望能安抚它们，或抵御精灵入侵庆祝活动的地方。妖怪总是雄性的，但可以而且确实与任何东西繁殖。在这方面，他们经常捕食干尸和仙女，但也被称为在婚礼上带走新娘和其他妇女。雄性后代总是法云。人们认为，法恩是源于一个大帝的诅咒，作为对勾引萨提尔真爱的惩罚而投向萨提尔。\"愿你的外表和你的内心一样野兽化，愿你所生的所有孩子都遭受同样的命运\"。",
	"A leanan is a female satyr, often mistaken for a succubus, looking like a highly attractive woman with horns, a tail and hooves. Many adventurers have tried to gain their exotic favors, but most of them despise violence, and particularly those that live mercenary lives, fighting for nothing but glory and gold. Leanans are known for seducing humanoids, regardless of race or gender, and are interested only in men and women that have already come of age. They usually do not kill without reason, if they attack, it is to protect their life, though they do draw energy from their lover to sustain themselves, often until the point of exhaustion. One notable exception concerns fauns, that they hate with passion and will always fight. A leanan will consider helping adventurers if they go against fauns or some truly vile creature, often offering a lock of her magical hair as a token.": "利安人是一种女性萨提尔，经常被误认为是魅魔，看起来像一个长着角、尾巴和蹄子的极具吸引力的女人。许多冒险家试图获得她们异国情调的青睐，但她们中的大多数人都鄙视暴力，尤其是那些过着雇佣兵生活的人，他们只为荣誉和黄金而战。利安人以勾引人类而闻名，不分种族和性别，只对已经成年的男人和女人感兴趣。他们通常不会无缘无故地杀人，如果他们攻击，也是为了保护自己的生命，尽管他们确实从爱人那里吸取能量来维持自己的生命，往往直到精疲力竭。一个明显的例外是关于小精灵的，他们对小精灵恨之入骨，并会一直战斗。如果冒险者与小精灵或一些真正卑鄙的生物作对，利安人会考虑帮助他们，常常提供一绺她的魔法头发作为信物。",
	"Leanans are true muses, they give inspiration to those they favor in exchange for their love and devotion. Many masterpieces have been created under their patronage and uninspired artist go to great lengths to catch their fickle affection. Through their inspiration, they can attune the lower and higher self, the instinct and the reason. This artistic journey involves meeting your animistic self in a trance state, a totemic beast that represents the instinct. One can lose himself in this revelation, potentially turning into a beast forever. It is unclear if this occurs by a lack of control from the leanan, or from a building exposure to the fey's magic.": "利安人是真正的缪斯女神，他们给他们喜欢的人提供灵感，以换取他们的爱和奉献。许多杰作都是在他们的赞助下创造的，而没有灵感的艺术家则不遗余力地捕捉他们善变的感情。通过他们的灵感，他们可以调整低级和高级自我，本能和理性。这个艺术之旅涉及到在恍惚状态下与你的万物之灵相遇，一个代表本能的图腾兽。一个人可以在这种启示中失去自我，有可能永远变成一只野兽。目前还不清楚这种情况的发生是由于缺乏来自利安人的控制，还是由于暴露在费伊人的魔法中。",
	"Unlike most fey creatures, leanans tend to live close to civilization, near towns and villages where they can easily meet young men and women eager to know love.

	"Ekimmara are patient hunters, they hide in the shadows and demonstrate exceptionally acute hearing and can turn {@condition invisible}, waiting unseen while dread of their unpreventable attack overwhelms their victim. Ekimmara show a true sense of cruelty, for they like to display their kill in public, leaving them in visible places for the mutilated corpse to be found.": "Ekimmara是个有耐心的猎人，他们躲在阴影中，表现出异常敏锐的听觉，可以转身（%0%），在受害者对他们无法预防的攻击的恐惧中等待着，不为人知。Ekimmara表现出真正的残忍，因为他们喜欢在公众面前展示他们的杀戮，把他们留在明显的地方，让人们发现残缺的尸体。",
	"Nobody really knows how an ekimmara is made. Many legends claim to know how they came to be, but none could be verified. Some say an ekimmara is born when a vampire bat feeds on the blood of a newborn illegitimately conceived during the full moon, which of the child or the bat is turning is unclear. Another popular legend pretend they are the damphyr children of mula and katakan vampires, conceived with a mortal, or that a giant bat drinking the blood of a katakan will raise as an ekimmara, depending on who you ear it from. Regardless of what scholars might think, it's probably for the best that nobody really knows the truth, for a deranged mind with the knowledge to create them could unleash a terrifying plague of bloodsuckers on the realms.": "没有人真正知道Ekimmara是如何制成的。许多传说都声称知道它们是如何形成的，但没有一个能得到证实。有些人说，当一只吸血蝙蝠吸食一个在满月期间非法受孕的新生儿的血液时，Ekimmara就诞生了，至于是孩子还是蝙蝠变的，则不清楚。另一个流行的传说假装他们是穆拉和卡塔坎吸血鬼的孩子，与凡人一起受孕，或者说一只巨大的蝙蝠喝了卡塔坎的血，就会成长为埃基玛拉，这取决于你从谁那里听到的。不管学者们怎么想，没有人真正知道真相可能是最好的，因为一个拥有创造它们的知识的疯狂的头脑可能会在这个世界上释放出可怕的吸血虫的瘟疫。",
	"Like most lesser vampires, ekimmaras usually hunt in urban areas at night, choosing a secluded place to hide during daylight hours. If its blood source becomes scarce and no other hunting ground is available, or the ekimmara becomes trapped somewhere, the monster can become dormant. Ekimmara can slumber for an extended period of time, potentially centuries. Adventurers entering a ruin with a past of unexplained bloody killings should make sure they come prepared. Vampire kills never miraculously stop and they might well be the next meal of a very hungry ekimmara.": "像大多数较小的吸血鬼一样，ekimmaras通常在夜间在城市地区狩猎，在白天选择一个僻静的地方躲藏起来。如果它的血源变得稀少，没有其他的狩猎场所，或者埃基玛拉被困在某个地方，这个怪物就会变得休眠。Ekimmara可以沉睡很长一段时间，可能是几个世纪。冒险者在进入一个过去有不明血腥杀戮的遗迹时，应该确保他们有备而来。吸血鬼的杀戮从未奇迹般地停止，他们很可能成为非常饥饿的埃基玛拉的下一顿饭。",
	"Ekimmaras base their perception on sound, literally \"seeing\" the sounds they project. Some rare subspecies have perfected this ability to the point of being able to project their voice, making it originate from a distant point. They use this ability to lure, terrify and isolate preys, cunningly waiting for a group to split up before striking.": "Ekimmaras将他们的感知建立在声音的基础上，实际上是 \"看到 \"他们投射的声音。一些罕见的亚种已经完善了这种能力，能够投射出他们的声音，使之从遥远的地方发出。它们利用这种能力来引诱、恐吓和隔离猎物，狡猾地等待一群人分开后再进行攻击。",
	"The ekimmara can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices, and choose a point of origin for the sound within 120 feet of it. They can imitate perfectly the sound of someone in distress, cries of a baby or screams of pain, usually replicating the last sounds of its victims. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check.": "ekimmara可以模仿它所听到的任何声音，包括声音，并在它周围120英尺内选择一个声音的起源点。它们可以完美地模仿某人陷入困境的声音、婴儿的哭声或痛苦的尖叫声，通常会复制其受害者最后的声音。听到这些声音的生物可以通过成功的DC 16智慧（洞察力）检查看出它们是模仿的。",
	"Common people believe that fleders are dead heathens who turned into vampires and rose from their graves. Being vampires, they attack sleeping people and drink their blood. According to peasants, a man bitten by a fleder becomes a fleder himself. This is nonsense, obviously, for towns would be completely infested by them after only a few weeks due to the creature's ravenous appetite.": "普通人认为，逃亡者是死去的异教徒，他们变成了吸血鬼，从坟墓里爬出来。作为吸血鬼，他们攻击睡着的人，喝他们的血。据农民说，被逃亡者咬过的人自己也会变成逃亡者。这显然是无稽之谈，因为由于这种生物贪婪的胃口，城镇在几周后就会被它们完全侵占。",
	"The fleder is a lesser vampire. Its appetite for blood is the only thing it shares with the noble princes of the night. A creature with animal instincts, deprived of any humanity, it can mutilate its victims terribly. Its head triangular, with a flat face and horn-like protrusions with certain bat-like features, including the creature's face and ears renders it similar to other animalistic vampires, such as garkain or ekimmara. With its glowing red eyes the fleder also resembles a demon and inspires terror in the heart of peasants and city folks alike.": "逃亡者是一种较低级的吸血鬼。它对血的渴望是它与高贵的夜之王子们唯一相同的地方。它是一种具有动物本能的生物，被剥夺了任何人性，它可以可怕地残害它的受害者。它的头是三角形的，有一个扁平的脸和像角一样的突起，有某些像蝙蝠一样的特征，包括生物的脸和耳朵，使它类似于其他动物性的吸血鬼，如garkain或ekimmara。逃亡者的红色眼睛闪闪发光，也很像恶魔，在农民和城市人的心中激发出恐怖。",
	"The fleder is not a good flier, the membranes under its arms allowing only short jumps and attacks from above. Though not particularly smart, it knows that it gains an advantage and increases its chance of victory by suddenly attacking unsuspecting victims. The long, prehensile toes on the beast's feet allow it to hang head down from the ceiling, one of its favorite method to ambush a prey. Fleders are terrified of sunlight and will avoid it at all cost. While it is true that they don't turn to ash while exposed to it like other vampires do, they are still significantly weaker when expose to direct sunlight, be it natural or magical. They are otherwise unaffected by the current time of the day but tend to slumber during daylight hours.": "逃亡者不是一个好的飞行者，它手臂下的膜只允许短距离跳跃和从上面攻击。虽然不是特别聪明，但它知道通过突然袭击毫无防备的受害者，它可以获得优势并增加胜利的机会。野兽脚上长长的无柄脚趾使它能从天花板上垂下头来，这是它最喜欢的伏击猎物的方法之一。逃亡者惧怕阳光，会不惜一切代价避免阳光照射。虽然它们确实不会像其他吸血鬼那样在阳光下变成灰烬，但当它们暴露在直接的阳光下时，无论是自然的还是魔法的，它们仍然会明显变弱。除此之外，他们不受当前时间的影响，但倾向于在白天沉睡。",
	"Fleder usually hunt in rundown city districts, especially where buildings are high and cramped, allowing the creature to use its agility to escape after a bloody meal. They are clever enough to recognize an inebriated prey, hunting near taverns to feed on unwary town drunks. Fleder are usually lone, nocturnal hunters, but in large cities, where they can cover a huge hunting ground, it can happen that a brood of this creatures band together. They then pick a common nest to rest during the day, often an abandoned church tower or an old windmill. They are also found in the wilderness, usually near cliffs and rugged, hilly lands where they can easily hide.": "弗雷德通常在破旧的城市地区捕猎，尤其是建筑物高大而狭窄的地方，使这种生物能够利用其敏捷性在血腥的食物后逃跑。它们很聪明，能够识别醉酒的猎物，在酒馆附近狩猎，以不知情的城里醉汉为食。苍蝇通常是孤独的夜间猎手，但在大城市，它们可以覆盖一个巨大的狩猎场，可能会发生一窝这种生物联合起来的情况。然后它们会选择一个共同的巢穴在白天休息，通常是一个废弃的教堂塔楼或一个旧风车。它们也可以在野外被发现，通常是在悬崖和崎岖的丘陵地带附近，在那里它们可以很容易地藏身。",
	"Few can muster enough powers to raise a fleder, only masters of the dark art have learned to create such horrors. When you cast the {@spell create undead} spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over one fleder vampire.": "很少有人能聚集起足够的力量来养活一个fleder，只有黑暗艺术的大师们才学会创造这样的恐怖。当你使用九级法术槽施展（%0%）法术时，你可以使一个逃亡的吸血鬼复活或重新获得控制权。",
	"When a giant bat feeds of the blood of the dead on desecrated ground, or directly from the veins of a higher vampire it can turn into a fleder. It is believed that the transformation can be adverted by nailing the bat to a wooden surface and stuffing it with garlic cloves. Some masters of the dark art, necromancy, can also raise fleder from corpses directly.": "当一只巨大的蝙蝠在被亵渎的地面上吸食死者的血液，或直接从高级吸血鬼的血管中吸食血液时，它就会变成一只逃亡者。据信，将蝙蝠钉在木头表面并塞入大蒜瓣，就可以宣传这种转变。一些黑暗艺术大师，即死灵法术，也能直接从尸体上养出飞毛腿。",
	"If you take a fleder and magnify all its most primitive traits, feeding it abundantly with higher vampire blood, you will eventually get a protofleder. This beast, the fleder's primal cousin, is the purest expression of its breed. In our time protofleders are rare, only appearing in the domain of a higher vampire or hibernating in secluded places, deep in the Underdark.": "如果你把一个飞毛腿放大它所有最原始的特征，用高级吸血鬼的血液大量喂养它，你最终会得到一个原飞毛腿。这种野兽，逃亡者的原始表亲，是其品种的最纯粹的表达。在我们的时代，原逃亡者是罕见的，只出现在高级吸血鬼的领域里，或者蛰伏在幽暗的地方，深入地下世界。",
	"Similarly to their lesser cousins, protofleders rely on their instincts rather than intelligence and are quite sensitive to the scent of blood. The members of this species are characterized by their considerable strength and resilience as well as the strange glow they emit, a trait most likely tied to their otherworldly nature. While in the presence of the vampire even a shallow cut can feel like bleeding to death. Agonizing pain is caused by the vampire's presence, as blood answers its voracious call.": "与它们较小的表亲相似，原生动物依靠它们的本能而不是智力，对血腥味相当敏感。这个物种的成员的特点是他们有相当大的力量和韧性，以及他们所发出的奇怪的光芒，这个特征很可能与他们的异世界的性质有关。在吸血鬼面前，即使是一个浅浅的伤口也会感觉到流血过多而死亡。吸血鬼的存在会造成痛苦，因为血液会响应它贪婪的召唤。",
	"No one in their right mind would qualify any of the bestial lesser vampires as beautiful, or pleasant to look at. They all are mockery of an overgrown bat, twisted monsters that defy the laws of nature. Still, none other reaches the grotesque ugliness of the garkain. Similarly to fleder and ekimmara the garkain looks like a giant, somewhat humanoid-looking bat. Their face is always a nightmare to look at, the simple vision of a garkain inspires dread. Regardless of their powers, it is the garkain nasty feeding habits that makes them truly loathsome adversary. The bite and claws of a garkain can transmit deadly diseases, poisoning the blood at alarming speed after a single scratch.": "正常人都不会把任何一个兽性较弱的吸血鬼说成是美丽的，或令人愉快的外观。他们都是对过度生长的蝙蝠的嘲弄，是违背自然规律的扭曲怪物。不过，没有一个能达到加尔卡恩的怪异丑陋。与Fleder和Ekimmara类似，garkain看起来像一只巨大的、有点像人的蝙蝠。他们的脸总是让人看了生不如死，简单地看一眼garkain就能让人感到恐惧。不管他们的能力如何，正是树妖讨厌的进食习惯使他们成为真正令人厌恶的对手。犬牙交错的咬痕和爪子可以传播致命的疾病，在一次抓挠之后就会以惊人的速度使血液中毒。",
	"Garkain infestations are often mistaken for a ghoul problem. The two creatures do share a similar taste for the rotten flesh of corpses and favor cemeteries and catacombs for their hunting ground. Garkains do not seem to mind sharing their territory with other undeads, especially ghouls, wraiths and other garkains. The nature of this phenomena is unknown but some comparisons have been made with the ability of higher vampires to call other undeads to serve them. It's rare, but not unheard of, to find garkains outside of cities. In most stories they were found in battlefields, feeding on the wounded and devouring the fallen.": "Garkain的侵扰常常被误认为是食尸鬼问题。这两种生物确实对尸体的腐肉有着相似的口味，并且喜欢在墓地和地下墓穴中狩猎。猎犬似乎并不介意与其他亡灵分享它们的领地，尤其是食尸鬼、裹尸人和其他猎犬。这种现象的性质不明，但有人将其与高级吸血鬼召唤其他亡灵为其服务的能力进行了比较。在城市以外的地方发现树袋熊是很罕见的，但并非闻所未闻。在大多数故事中，他们在战场上被发现，以受伤的人为食，吞噬死去的人。",
	"The revolting garkain are difficult subject to study. Most are immediately burned once destroyed, by fear of the diseases their body could spread, making it excessively difficult for scholars to learn anything about them. Some have said that people bitten by the vampire and succumbing to its disease can raise the following night as a garkain. This is a frightful thought, and an even better reason to burn the bodies.": "叛逆的加尔卡恩是难以研究的对象。由于担心他们的身体会传播疾病，大多数人一旦被消灭就会立即被烧死，这使得学者们极难了解他们的情况。有些人说，被吸血鬼咬了并屈服于它的疾病的人可以在第二天晚上复活，成为一个garkain。这是一个可怕的想法，也是焚烧尸体的一个更好的理由。",
	"The undead body of the garkain is like a walking incubator, brewing terrible afflictions, empowered by the entropic nature of the monster.": "加尔卡恩的不死之身就像一个行走的孵化器，酝酿着可怕的苦难，由怪物的熵性所赋予。",
	"A creature affected by the garkain's stain quickly start to develop open wounds that never stop bleeding and festering boils. Any humanoid creature that spend more than 1 minute within 10 feet of an infected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the garkain's stain of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.": "受树皮色斑影响的生物很快就会开始出现流血不止的开放式伤口和溃烂的疖子。任何在受感染生物10英尺范围内停留超过1分钟的人形生物都必须在DC12宪法救赎中获得成功，否则也会被感染上这种疾病。一旦一个生物成功地完成了这一救赎，它就会在24小时内免疫于那个被感染的生物的加尔肯人的污点。",
	"A character that has proficiency with Alchemist's Tools or Herbalism Kit, and access to the proper equipment, can prepare a serum from the fangs on the initial garkain. The serum has a value of 40gp when its comes to crafting (see crafting rules p.187 of the Player's Handbook). One batch of serum is enough to cure 10 patients.": "熟练掌握炼金术士工具或草药学套件的角色，并能获得适当的设备，可以从最初的鲨鱼身上的獠牙制备血清。血清在制作时的价值为40gp（见《玩家手册》第187页的制作规则）。一批血清足以治愈10个病人。",
	"An encounter with an alpha garkain almost always ends in death, which is why there are not many eyewitness accounts of them. From a few written reports, it seems these horrible monsters do not content themselves with drinking the blood of their victims. The investigators concluded from the blood and guts strewn around the crime scenes that alpha garkains tear their victims to shreds with great delight and muck about in their bloody entrails.": "与阿尔法-加尔卡恩的相遇几乎总是以死亡告终，这就是为什么关于他们的目击者不多。从一些书面报告来看，这些可怕的怪物似乎并不满足于饮用受害者的血液。调查人员从散落在犯罪现场的血液和内脏中得出结论，阿尔法树精非常高兴地把受害者撕成碎片，并在他们血淋淋的内脏中捣乱。",
	"Alpha garkain often gather around themselves members of other subspecies of lesser vampires, other garkains and fleders mainly, but also ghouls at times, acting in such situations as leaders of the pack. Their surprising psychic abilities instinctively draw other undead to them, making them especially good \"accomplices\" for higher vampires that can control or bribe them.": "阿尔法树精经常在自己周围聚集其他亚种的低等吸血鬼成员，主要是其他树精和逃亡者，但有时也有食尸鬼，在这种情况下充当群体的领袖。他们惊人的通灵能力本能地将其他亡灵吸引到他们身边，使他们成为能够控制或贿赂他们的高级吸血鬼的特别好的 \"帮凶\"。",
	"During combat, alpha garkains usually keep their distance from their foes, trying to incapacitate them using a blast of mental energy provoking visions that beguile and disorient. Despite their bestial demeanor, alpha garkains are quite clever and will wait in ambush or maneuver lesser members of their pack into a semblance of strategy.": "在战斗中，首领犬通常会与敌人保持距离，试图用爆炸性的精神能量使他们丧失能力，从而引起幻觉，让他们迷失方向。尽管它们有兽性，但首领犬还是相当聪明的，它们会埋伏起来，或操纵它们族群中较小的成员，使之形成一种战略。",
	"Unlike most vampires, higher vampires, also called \"pure-blood\" or \"true vampire\", are incredibly rare and often mistaken with other vampires, especially katakans and bruxae. Specialists in supernatural species of various academies gave the name \"Vampires Superiores\" to such beings, and while many tomes and books were written about their existence, their true nature changes greatly between varied individuals. However, most of the higher vampires do share some traits that make them truly higher vampires: incredible intelligence, immortality, immunity to steel and most mainstream ways of extermination, as well as astounding regeneration.": "与大多数吸血鬼不同，高级吸血鬼，也被称为 \"纯血 \"或 \"真正的吸血鬼\"，非常罕见，经常被误认为是其他吸血鬼，特别是卡塔肯人和布鲁克斯人。各个学院的超自然物种专家给这种生物命名为 \"超级吸血鬼\"，虽然有许多关于他们的存在的书籍，但他们的真实性质在不同的人之间变化很大。然而，大多数高级吸血鬼确实有一些共同的特征，使他们成为真正的高级吸血鬼：难以置信的智慧、不死之身、对钢铁和大多数主流灭绝方式的免疫力，以及令人震惊的再生能力。",
	"Only a mutual thirst for blood links higher vampires to their distant and much more primitive cousins. They long for their kind, as they are the only ones that can truly relate with their unique view of the world and understand them. They not only resemble humanoids in appearance, but also share their behavioral patterns. This means they do not hide in distant forest or lurk in the shadows. On the contrary, they are particularly fond of cities, where they live out deceivingly public life. Only the fact that they have no reflections in mirrors or reflective surfaces can reveal their true nature, for divination and common means to detect the undead have no sway on them.": "只有对血液的相互渴求将高等吸血鬼与他们遥远的、更原始的表亲联系起来。他们渴望自己的同类，因为他们是唯一能够真正与他们对世界的独特看法相联系并理解他们的人。他们不仅在外观上与人类相似，而且还与人类的行为模式相同。这意味着他们不会躲在遥远的森林里或潜伏在阴影中。相反，他们特别喜欢城市，在那里他们过着欺骗性的公共生活。只有他们在镜子或反射面中没有反射的事实可以揭示他们的真实性质，因为占卜和探测亡灵的普通手段对他们没有影响。",
	"While they are feared and shunned in most cultures, not all higher vampires are dangerous to humans, as some live life that may help humanoids, or evade them in general. As intelligent beings their morality depends entirely of their personality and beliefs, although many higher vampires do drink blood. While not forced to drink blood to survive, many look down on humans as an alcoholic looks at a good bottle. The infamous treaty {@i \"Human Husbandry and Care\"}, a volume describing the herding of humans, shaped the vision of the public against higher vampires. It is unfortunately true that some higher vampires cultivate herds of enslaved human to feed their blood addiction, refining the taste of their blood through selective breeding and diet.": "虽然他们在大多数文化中都被惧怕和回避，但并不是所有的高级吸血鬼都对人类有危险，因为有些人的生活可能会帮助人类，或者在一般情况下逃避人类。作为智能生物，他们的道德完全取决于他们的个性和信仰，尽管许多高级吸血鬼确实喝血。虽然不是为了生存而被迫喝血，但许多人看不起人类，就像一个酒鬼看一个好瓶子一样。臭名昭著的条约（%0%），一卷描述人类的牧民，塑造了公众对高等吸血鬼的看法。不幸的是，一些高级吸血鬼培养成群的被奴役的人类来满足他们的血瘾，通过选择性的繁殖和饮食来提炼他们的血的味道，这是事实。",
	"The {@i Night of the Long Fangs}, a solar eclipse of unprecedented scale, is believed by scholars to be the event that brought the higher vampires from an unknown plane (many believe it to be a Domain of Dread or the Deep Ethereal, but no definite proof was ever found), into the Prime Material Plane. The transpiring events have taken root in many cultures as a fearful night, when evil comes out to feed on humanity and needs to be repelled with loud and boastful celebrations. Mankind might not remember the day of the higher vampire's arrival, for it happened long ago and mortals are so quick to forget. However, the carnivals, masquerades and ceremonies that are held on that night most likely find their roots in this dreadful and bloody event.": "{@i Night of the Long Fangs}，一场规模空前的日食，被学者们认为是将高级吸血鬼从一个未知的位面（许多人认为是恐惧之域或深层虚空，但没有找到确切的证据）带到主物质位面的事件。即将发生的事件在许多文化中扎下了根，成为一个可怕的夜晚，当邪恶出来吸食人类时，需要用响亮而夸张的庆祝活动来驱除。人类可能不记得高级吸血鬼到来的日子，因为它发生在很久以前，而凡人是如此迅速地忘记。然而，那晚举行的狂欢节、化妆舞会和仪式很可能在这个可怕而血腥的事件中找到根源。",
	"Few know that higher vampires gather in tribes, united by a mystical blood bound between members. Tribes are mostly scattered, with a few unseen elders at the top that call for gatherings when needed. Three of them are commonly known as the founding tribes, {@i Garasham}, {@i Ammurun} and {@i Tdet} and date back from when the higher vampire race first became stranded on the Prime Material Plane. It is believed that the tribes first emerged long ago from tunnels of the Underdark during an event recalled as the {@i \"Night of the Long Fangs\"}. The exact location of their arrival remains hidden, locked behind secret markings, powerful wards, that can only be opened by higher vampire blood. Still, every hundred years anniversary of the {@i Night of the Long Fangs}, pilgrimages are made by higher vampires wishing to remember where they hail from.": "很少有人知道，高级吸血鬼聚集在部落中，通过成员之间的神秘血液联系在一起。部落大多是分散的，顶端有几个看不见的长老，在需要的时候召集大家聚会。其中三个部落通常被称为创始部落，分别是{@i Garasham}、{@i Ammurun}和{@i Tdet}，可以追溯到高等吸血鬼种族第一次滞留在主物质世界的时候。人们相信这些部落是在很久以前，在一个被称为 \"3%\"的事件中从地下世界的隧道中首次出现的。他们到达的确切位置仍然是隐藏的，被锁在秘密的标记和强大的防护罩后面，只有高级吸血鬼的血液才能打开。尽管如此，每到(4%)的百年纪念日，希望记住他们来自何处的高等吸血鬼都会来朝圣。",
	"Higher vampires are certainly among the fiercest creatures recorded in history, furthermore one which is impossible to kill through normal means. They are master shapechangers, capable of turning into mist or a monstrous war form effortlessly. Their strength and speed cannot be matched by mortals, and most attacks will only graze them. Their regenerative abilities significantly outpace those of anything else encountered or that can be possibly imagined. Adding to the grim picture, all have unique abilities that make it impossible to predict their behavior or exact capacities in a fight. In other words, even an experienced monster slayer should think twice before accepting a contract on one of these creatures, even if half a kingdom and a princess' hand is in the balance.": "高级吸血鬼当然是历史上记录的最凶猛的生物之一，而且是不可能通过正常手段杀死的。他们是变身大师，能够毫不费力地变成雾状或畸形的战争形态。他们的力量和速度是凡人无法比拟的，大多数攻击只能擦伤他们。他们的再生能力大大超过了其他遇到的或可能想象到的东西。更为严峻的是，它们都有独特的能力，使人无法预测它们在战斗中的行为或确切能力。换句话说，即使是有经验的怪物杀手，在接受这些生物的合同之前也应该三思而行，即使半个王国和公主的手处于平衡之中。",
	"Higher Vampire cannot be permanently killed, unless very specific circumstances are met, which makes it quite rare for one to meet its true final death. This immortality in no way means that death is pleasant for them. In fact, it is one of the most traumatic event they can experience, destroying their mind and memories and driving them to insanity. This phenomenon is named the {@i Fog of Ages}:": "高级吸血鬼不能被永久地杀死，除非满足非常特殊的情况，这使得一个人相当罕见地遇到真正的最终死亡。这种不朽性绝不意味着死亡对他们来说是愉快的。事实上，这是他们能经历的最痛苦的事件之一，破坏了他们的思想和记忆，使他们陷入疯狂。这种现象被命名为（%0%）。",
	"When a higher vampire is killed and its body is destroyed, its Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma ability score are permanently reduced by 2. Additionally, it loses 1d10 decades of memory, replaced by incoherent and terrifying visions or alternatively a false, twisted, version of past events.": "当一个高级吸血鬼被杀，其身体被摧毁时，其智力、智慧和魅力的能力得分会永久地减少2分。此外，它还会失去10年的记忆，取而代之的是不连贯的、可怕的幻觉，或者是一个虚假的、扭曲的、过去事件的版本。",

	"Defeating a higher vampire in combat does not guarantee it will stay dead. Higher vampires cannot be truly killed by just anyone. Most suffered several deaths over the ages, each time regenerating over a period of decades. Only a higher vampire can truly kill another of its kind, without the risk of regeneration, although some rare volume hint that they might be vulnerable during a total solar eclipse. This weakness built the most important law of their society: killing another higher vampire is punished by permanent exile, and eternity is a long time to spend alone. This law holds special significance, for the number of higher vampire is finite, with no means known to create another.": "在战斗中击败高等吸血鬼并不保证它能保持死亡。高级吸血鬼不可能被任何人真正杀死。大多数人在过去的岁月中遭受过几次死亡，每次都会在几十年的时间里重生。只有高等吸血鬼才能真正杀死另一个同类，而没有再生的风险，尽管一些罕见的数量暗示他们在日全食期间可能会很脆弱。这个弱点建立了他们社会最重要的法律：杀死另一个高级吸血鬼会被永久流放，而永恒是一个漫长的时间，可以独自度过。这条法律具有特殊的意义，因为高等吸血鬼的数量是有限的，没有办法创造另一个。",
	"Higher Vampires are incredibly intelligent, but for all their intellect they cannot grasp the concept of mortality, a thought utterly alien to them. They see existence as a cycle, with no beginning or end, as they do not need a physical body to exist. Their experience and viewpoint on life and death is hard to envision for anyone else. \"Death\" for them means lingering in a state of nothingness, best described by few as \"drowning in an infinite sea of perpetual icy terror\", unable to differentiate reality from dream, time from space. This maddening state lasts until they can return to their physical form, weakened, and recovering for months.": "高等吸血鬼是非常聪明的，但他们的智力却无法掌握死亡的概念，这种想法对他们来说完全是陌生的。他们认为存在是一个循环，没有开始或结束，因为他们不需要有形的身体来存在。他们对生命和死亡的经验和观点是其他任何人都难以想象的。\"死亡 \"对他们来说意味着在虚无状态中徘徊，少数人将其描述为 \"淹没在无限的永久冰冷恐怖的海洋中\"，无法区分现实与梦想，时间与空间。这种令人抓狂的状态一直持续到他们能够回到他们的身体形态，被削弱，并恢复了几个月。",
	"The almighty higher vampires remain a mystery for most, their enigmatic nature, erratic memory of the past and resistance to divination makes any information gathering on their origins almost impossible. A few pointers remain, scattered in the distant past and deep in strange Underdark caves. They are certainly of a planar origin, entering the Prime Material Plane during a solar eclipse eon ago, but beyond that, only their elders might remember the truth. One thing is for certain though, no new higher vampire has ever been seen, and it is safe to assume that whatever dreadful conditions was necessary to create these beings will probably never be met again, or may the gods preserve us all.": "全能的高等吸血鬼对大多数人来说仍然是个谜，他们神秘的本质、对过去不稳定的记忆和对占卜的抵抗力使得任何关于他们起源的信息收集几乎是不可能的。少数的指针仍然存在，散落在遥远的过去和奇怪的地下城洞穴深处。他们肯定是来自一个平面，在很久以前的一次日食中进入主物质界，但除此之外，只有他们的长辈可能记得真相。但有一点是肯定的，从来没有看到过新的高等吸血鬼，可以安全地假设，无论创造这些生命的可怕条件是什么，可能永远不会再遇到了，或者愿诸神保护我们所有人。",
	"All higher vampires have a special connection to blood, regardless of what might be their stand on drinking it. However, none understands the mystical bind that unites all life like the Blood Callers. Higher vampires that demonstrate such powers are rarely restraining their dark appetites and often bath in literal fountain of blood. That said, there are enough counterexamples of Blood Callers interested in modern medicine, especially when it comes to cure blood diseases, to redeem the image of such higher vampires.": "所有高级吸血鬼都与血液有着特殊的联系，无论他们对饮用血液的立场是什么。然而，没有人像唤血者那样理解将所有生命结合起来的神秘束缚。表现出这种能力的高级吸血鬼很少克制自己的黑暗欲望，而且经常沐浴在血的喷泉中。也就是说，有足够的反例表明，唤血者对现代医学感兴趣，特别是在治疗血液疾病时，可以挽回这种高级吸血鬼的形象。",
	"If one type of higher vampire had to be blamed for the awful reputation of their entire race, fingers would certainly point at the Death Weavers.

	"Higher vampires differentiate from their lower cousins by their might and intellect. Some however show a greater understanding of their feral instinct and are able to project the inner beast that sleeps in them, exerting control on creatures of the night.

	"Katakans on the hunt hide in the shadows, using their power of invisibility until they are ready to strike. Of all the vampire breeds katakans are the most selective when it comes to their prey. Katakans almost exclusively feed on one specific type of victim, depending on the vampire's own taste. Young and fair noblewomen, drunkards loaded on vodka, leprose's blood, all are very plausible delicacies for the vampire. A katakan will go to great lengths to fulfill its addiction, infiltrating mortal society and assuming a common identity or securing a haven close to its blood source.": "狩猎中的卡塔肯人隐藏在阴影中，利用他们的隐形能力，直到他们准备好攻击。在所有的吸血鬼品种中，当涉及到他们的猎物时，Katakans是最有选择性的。卡塔肯人几乎只以一种特定类型的受害者为食，这取决于吸血鬼自己的口味。年轻漂亮的贵族妇女、喝了伏特加的醉汉、麻风病人的血，对吸血鬼来说都是非常合理的美味佳肴。卡塔坎会不遗余力地满足自己的嗜好，渗透到凡人社会中，冒充普通人的身份，或者在靠近血源的地方获得一个避难所。",
	"Katakans are notably smarter and more powerful than ekimmaras. Their power only increases at night, and so an adventurer should take additional precautions if they hunt one at those late hours. Alternatively, the hunter should wait for daylight, so the katakan's natural regeneration is impaired. When hunting a katakan it is imperative to remember one simple fact: you will not get the drop on him and it is very likely that you are already being stalked. Katakans are invulnerable to steel, regenerate quickly, and demonstrate acute hearing. They also demonstrate an exceptionnal sense of smelling, for they are able of identifying the blood of their favorite prey over great distances, much like sharks. However, for all their strengths, katakan have one very common weakness, garlic. They find its smell simply revolting and even feel sick in its close vicinity.

	"To paint an average picture of a katakan's lair is a futile task, for there is as many types of lairs as there is of katakans. Few monsters show such a sense of individuality.

Most katakans will not even entertain the idea, and such unlikely alliances are always short-lived.": "对卡塔坎的巢穴进行平均描绘是一项徒劳的任务，因为有多少种巢穴就有多少种卡塔坎。很少有怪物表现出这样的个人意识。他们本质上是独行侠，很少与其他吸血鬼交往，除非他们可以用持续的血源来贿赂他们，或者感到被一个他们无法战胜的敌人威胁到。大多数卡塔肯人甚至不会考虑这个想法，这种不可能的联盟总是短暂的。",
	"Oddly enough katakans myths have a lot in common with tales of lycanthropy, rumored to be the stillborn offsprings of men and beasts. Most of this folklore probably contains a grain of truth, but it is difficult to separate the legends told by illeterate peasants from the actual facts. One of the reoccuring myth states that a powerful lycanthrope that is turned into a vampire will become a katakan, or that eating a lamb killed by a lycanthrope will turn you into one. One point were most legends seem to coincide is that stuffing the mouth of the dead with garlic will prevent its transformation.": "奇怪的是，卡塔肯人的神话与狼人的故事有很多共同之处，传言他们是人和野兽的死胎后代。这些民间传说大多可能含有一定的真实性，但很难将贫苦农民讲述的传说与实际情况分开。其中一个反复出现的神话说，一个强大的狼人被变成吸血鬼后会变成卡塔坎，或者吃了被狼人杀死的羊肉会让你变成狼人。大多数传说似乎都不谋而合的一点是，用大蒜塞住死者的嘴会阻止其转变。",

	"Mulae are humanoid vampires that can somewhat pass for humans or elves if watched from a distance. From close vicinity though, nobody would mistake them for anything else than a terrifying creature of the night. They are completely hairless, with hellish facial features: a mouth filled with nightmarish fangs and bloodshot frenzied eyes. Despite their feral appearance, mulae are highly intelligent vampires, capable of elaborate planning and preparation but their ravening appetite will force them into isolation.

Most people believe that mulae are invincible, abandoning their home to find shelter in temples when one is spotted. They are not that far from the truth. Mulae are invulnerable to common steel and can regenerate most wounds quickly, or almost instantly if they can feed.

Even such measures might not suffice, for they can rejuvenate if not destroyed properly.": "穆拉吸血鬼对所有神圣的东西都有一种深深的恐惧。如果可以，他们会避开圣地，如果可以避免，他们绝不会心甘情愿地进入礼拜场所。大多数人认为穆拉是不可战胜的，一旦发现有穆拉，就会弃家到寺庙中寻找庇护。他们离事实并不遥远。穆拉对普通的钢铁是无敌的，并能迅速再生大多数伤口，如果它们能进食，几乎是瞬间就能再生。放倒它们需要辐射攻击或真正地把它们切成碎片。即使是这样的措施也可能不够，因为如果不适当地摧毁它们，它们可以重新焕发活力。",
	"Like the ekimmara, the mula can enter a state of dormancy, waiting for better times to come. Some, usually once they were destroyed, will rejuvenate in the cold respite of a grave. Depending how badly their body was damaged, it can take up to a decade for the creature to reappear. Unusually thick fog over a graveyard is often the sign that a mula is resting there. Other mulae simply enter torpor once their bloody work is accomplished, waiting to pick up the scent of wicked blood once more.": "像埃基玛拉一样，穆拉可以进入休眠状态，等待更好的时机到来。有些人，通常一旦被摧毁，就会在坟墓的寒冷喘息中恢复活力。根据他们的身体被破坏的严重程度，这种生物可能需要十年的时间才能重新出现。墓地上空不寻常的浓雾往往是一个木拉在那里休息的标志。其他的穆拉一旦完成了血腥的工作，就会进入休眠状态，等待再次采集邪恶的血腥气味。",
	"Mulae cull the wicked, slay the irreverent and slaughter the tormented with no discrimination, remorse or mercy.

They are left at the mercy of their own relentless thirsts, for there can be no greater suffering for a vampire than to not die for aeons from the great thirst that wracks their body and destroy their former personality.

	"A warp spawn is a term to describe a whole spectrum of mutated creatures warped into being by the corrupting influence of warpstone. Some manage to stave off this doom for a time, but, for most, the fate of becoming a warp spawn lies at the end of their dark and horrible road. Warp spawn lose what little remained of their original forms, becoming a shifting mass of tentacles and eyes. A rare few retain just enough of their original forms to become truly horrific. Upon the moment of devolution, the subject is wracked with agonizing pangs as his body ripples and undulates. The pain is so great it destroys the mind, erasing nearly every memory, all emotion, and the capability of forming a coherent thought.": "经脉之卵是一个术语，用来描述被经脉之石的腐蚀影响而扭曲成的一系列变异生物。有些人能够暂时避免这种厄运，但对大多数人来说，成为经脉之卵的命运就在他们黑暗而可怕的道路尽头。经脉产卵人失去了他们原来的形态，变成了由触手和眼睛组成的变化多端的群体。少数人保留了足够的原始形态，成为真正可怕的人。在泯灭的那一刻，受试者被痛苦的煎熬所折磨，因为他的身体出现了波纹和波动。这种痛苦是如此之大，它破坏了思想，几乎抹去了所有的记忆，所有的情感，以及形成一个连贯的思想的能力。",
	"When a warp spawn comes shambling from its lair, it will behave in a largely unpredictable manner. The spawn will move towards the enemy and crashes flailing into them; teeth, claws, and tentacles tearing men limb from limb in a shower of blood and ruination. A warp spawn is a formidable opponent on its own, capable of slaughtering an entire group of adventurer, but the threat is poses does not resides solely on the brutal strength and flurry of attack of the creature, but in the corrupting touch that it spreads. The fate of a spawn is to die, either on the field of battle by axe or sword, torn apart in the wilds by even more savage creatures, or literally ripped asunder by the energies that continues to course through its twisted body. Mindless and utterly beyond reason, warp spawn relentlessly attack anything in their way, the blows of their enemies merely a strange relief to the endless insanity that is their miserable existence.": "当一个经脉产卵器从它的巢穴中摇摇晃晃地走出来时，它的行为在很大程度上是不可预知的。它将向敌人移动并猛烈撞击他们；牙齿、爪子和触手在血雨中把人的肢体撕裂。经脉之卵本身就是一个可怕的对手，能够屠杀一整队冒险者，但它所构成的威胁并不仅仅在于生物的残暴力量和一连串的攻击，而是在于它所传播的腐蚀之力。卵子的命运是死亡，要么是在战场上被斧头或刀剑砍死，要么是在荒野中被更多野蛮的生物撕碎，要么是被继续在其扭曲的身体中流动的能量撕碎。无意识的、完全超越理性的，经脉产卵者无情地攻击任何阻碍他们的东西，他们的敌人的打击只是对他们悲惨存在的无尽疯狂的一种奇怪的缓解。",

It is said that the sight of them is so horrifying that hardened warriors are rendered incapable of any action while they gagged and retched in disgust. Many spawns die within minutes or hours of their transformation, being killed by their former companions or expiring as their impossibly mutated bodies give out under the strain. Such is not the fate of balewings, however. By some strange quirk of fate, they grow and prosper by ingesting and absorbing the fleshy tissues and fluids of living creatures. They achieve this by grabbing their victims with their tentacles, dissolving them with melting acid and slurping the fleshy goo that is left.": "Balewings是所有经脉产卵中最病态、最恶心的一些。据说它们的景象是如此可怕，以至于坚韧不拔的战士们在厌恶地堵住嘴和呕吐时无法采取任何行动。许多产卵人在变身后的几分钟或几小时内就死了，被他们以前的同伴杀死，或者因为他们不可能变异的身体在压力下衰竭而死。然而，这并不是巴洛温的命运。由于某种奇怪的命运怪癖，它们通过摄取和吸收生物的肉体组织和液体而成长和壮大。它们通过用触手抓住受害者，用融化的酸液溶解它们，然后啜饮剩下的肉质黏液来实现这一目标。",
	"Balewings are thankfully rare and can only be found near important warpstone deposit or deep underground, where meteor struck the world eons ago.

They are often hiding under the surface to ambush their preys. The fleshy bioluminescent growth atop its head (called illicium) acts as a camouflage for the predator, effectively disguising it as the surrounding lure weed to fool its prey.": "Dluurs很可能是变异的鮟鱇鱼，因水生沃普石沉积物的存在而被污染。它们通常被发现生活在沼泽地、河流或地下湖泊中，那里有诱饵草，这是唯一已知的对抗经络病的自然疗法。它们经常躲在地表下伏击猎物。它头顶上长出的肉质生物发光体（称为illicium）作为捕食者的伪装，有效地将其伪装成周围的诱饵草，骗过猎物。",
	"Cautious travelers can spot these creatures hiding among lure weed and avoid a surprise attack. Otherwise, the dluur's illicium can be distinguished from the plant by the lack of leaves of a single appendage resting on the water's surface. Sometimes, the dluur's head can be visible under the surface and mistaken for these leaves from afar, but will remain submerged until the prey is close enough. The dluur is an aggressive creature with the ability to spit corrosive acid and lure its prey with minor psychic abilities. In combat, they often rely on these long ranged attacks, but have been observed to charge at their prey and use their claws, though often they will halt mid charge to use their preferred method.": "谨慎的旅行者可以发现这些躲在诱饵草中的生物，避免遭到突然袭击。否则，可以通过没有叶子的单一附属物停在水面上的方式，将dluur的illicium与植物区分开来。有时，在水面下可以看到dluur的头部，从远处看会被误认为是这些叶子，但在猎物足够接近之前，它会一直沉在水中。德鲁尔是一种好斗的生物，能够吐出腐蚀性的酸液，并以轻微的精神能力引诱其猎物。在战斗中，它们经常依靠这些远程攻击，但也有人观察到它们会向猎物冲锋并使用它们的爪子，不过它们经常会在冲锋过程中停下来，使用它们喜欢的方法。",

The dolgotha emits a characteristic sound, akin to a low and deep moan, that often leads people to believe its hunting territory is haunted. It is therefore advised to always keep an ear out, to avoid running into one by accident. The dolgothas are nicknamed \"Fog Crawlers\", for they always come with the fog. The truth is that the creature is the source of the supernatural fog, using it instinctively to dissimulate its approach.

Only a few daring warriors in history have managed to defeat an ulfhedinn, and each of them is commemorated in ballads as a hero to this day.": "Ulfhedinn是狼人的一个品种，主要存在于世界的北极或寒冷地区。这些土地的严酷和贫瘠条件可能解释了为什么他们主要猎杀人类，而且比南方的兄弟们更强壮。他们与冬天的力量有着密切的联系，并在冰冷的温度下茁壮成长，利用暴风雪来掩盖他们的接近。历史上只有少数大胆的战士成功地击败了ulfhedinn，而他们中的每一个人至今都被作为英雄在民谣中纪念着。",

No stories exist of ulfhedinns being freed from their curse, and most experts agree that the curse is simply impossible to break once it reaches that point.

	"Ulfhedinn are often called \"Wolf King\" in ballads and legends, and indeed packs of predator seem to instinctively defer to them, particularly dire wolves and winter wolves. The pack show signs of respect to the werewolf, leaving fresh kill at the entrance of its cave or directing preys toward its lair, cutting all possible retreat and watching their supreme alpha take the kill. Those affected by lycanthropy can feel their inner beast stir within them as the werewolf approaches, for these predator kings have the power to awake the beast inside any cursed shapeshifter, forcing them to change and serve him as the king of hunters.": "乌尔菲丁在民谣和传说中常被称为 \"狼王\"，事实上，成群的捕食者似乎本能地服从于他们，特别是可怕的狼和冬狼。狼群对狼人表现出尊重的迹象，将新鲜的猎物留在洞口，或将猎物引向它的巢穴，切断所有可能的退路，看着他们至高无上的首领夺取猎物。当狼人接近时，那些受狼人影响的人可以感觉到他们内心的野兽在蠢蠢欲动，因为这些捕食者之王有能力唤醒任何受诅咒的变形者体内的野兽，迫使他们改变并作为猎人之王为他服务。",

The voref can be called upon by the witch that cursed it, playing the role of unknowing assassin or enforcer. A man who transforms back to his human form can't usually remember the atrocious acts committed as a werewolf otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life, to no end since the curse won't even allow him this relief.": "狼人既不是动物，也不是人，他从两个物种中吸取了最坏的东西：狼的嗜血和原始本性，以及人类的无情和残酷。一个人成为voref狼人是由施法者抛出的诅咒造成的--这种变化本身是无法控制的，也是不情愿的。voref可以被诅咒它的女巫召唤，扮演不知情的刺客或执行者的角色。变回人形的人通常不会记得作为狼人时的残暴行为，否则他肯定会发疯，并夺走自己的生命，但这是没有结果的，因为诅咒甚至不允许他有这种解脱。",
	"Killing a voref for good can prove difficult, for the magic of the curse binds it in death as well, bringing it back to life if slayed. The only known way to prevent this is to pierce its heart with a silver weapon during the full moon, or to force the spellcaster that cursed it to lift the spell. The voref's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire method for doing this. A group of adventurers seeking to undertake such a task must equip themselfves with a great deal of patience and sturdy armors.": "杀死一个voref是很困难的，因为诅咒的魔力也将它束缚在死亡中，如果被杀死，它又会复活。唯一已知的方法是在满月时用银质武器刺穿它的心脏，或者迫使诅咒它的施法者解除咒语。voref的诅咒有时可以被解除，但没有通用的、万无一失的方法来做到这一点。一群冒险者要完成这样的任务，必须为自己配备大量的耐心和结实的盔甲。",
	"Hunting a voref is extremely hard and dangerous due to the hidden nature of the werewolf. The werewolf seems perfectly normal and do not manifest the classic symptoms of lycanthropy while the curse lies dormant, until its master decides to trigger it. Still, werewolves are creatures of the night and they are especially active during the full moon, as such, vorefs must transform during the full moon, just as other werewolves. Vorefs are also very allergic to aconitum, also known as \"wolfsbane\", making them avoid areas where the plant grows.": "由于狼人的隐蔽性，猎杀Voref是非常困难和危险的。狼人看起来非常正常，在诅咒休眠时不会表现出狼人的典型症状，直到其主人决定触发它。然而，狼人是夜间的生物，他们在满月时特别活跃，因此，狼人必须在满月时变身，就像其他狼人一样。狼人对乌头碱也非常过敏，也被称为 \"狼毒\"，这使他们避开了有这种植物生长的地区。",
	"A Voref usually goes hunting alone, carrying the order of its master, as there rarely is an opponent that can match its strength, agility and fast health regeneration. It strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors and regenerate any damage received in mere moments.

	"The curse of a voref werewolf operates quite differently from common lycanthropy on a mystical level. As such, the bite of a voref does not spread the curse, for the magic is contained inside the unfortunate vessel. During the full moon, a spellcaster that knows the bestow curse spell can use a 9th level slot to cast the curse. A wish spell can inflict the curse as well. Until the next full moon, the curse can be dispelled as any spell would, but once it reaches that point only the creature that casted it can revoke it. Alternatively, a wish spell casted specifically to break the curse will also work if the werewolf lies dead.": "沃雷夫狼人的诅咒在神秘的层面上与普通狼人的运作方式截然不同。因此，狼人的咬伤并不会传播诅咒，因为魔力包含在这个不幸的容器中。在满月期间，知道赐予诅咒法术的施法者可以使用9级的槽来施放诅咒。愿望法术也可以施加诅咒。在下一个满月之前，这个诅咒可以像其他法术一样被驱散，但是一旦达到这个程度，只有施放诅咒的生物可以撤销它。另外，如果狼人已经死亡，专门为打破诅咒而施放的愿望咒语也会起作用。",

This seems to confirm the hypothesis that the spectral riders come from another world and are susceptible to magic, especially of the ritual kind, and cosmic events.

As it seems, the dwarves ignore everything on mutual terms, while the elves are mysteriously skittish on that subject, but refer to it as \"Dearg Ruadhri\", the Red Riders, and mutter hushed words about the Ithlinne's prophecy.": "天文观测可以用来计算狂猎的出现频率。这似乎证实了这样的假设：幽灵骑士来自另一个世界，容易受到魔法的影响，尤其是仪式类的魔法，以及宇宙事件。狂猎的故事并没有出现在矮人和精灵文化中。这相当有趣，因为这样古老的种族一定比人类早早就面临着狩猎。看起来，矮人在相互条件下忽略了一切，而精灵在这个问题上则神秘地避而不谈，但将其称为 \"Dearg Ruadhri\"，即红色骑士，并对Ithlinne的预言低声说了几句。",

They are known to have a profound hatred for their eladrin cousins, their elven descendants, and celestials, especially unicorns.": "很少有人知道，最古老的艾拉德林传说中提到了另一个由异种和天人组成的部落--艾尔族。两者很久以前就分道扬镳了，确切的原因已经被历史所遗忘，但涉及到Aen Elle国王日益增长的野心和腐败，其对权力的渴望威胁到了多元宇宙的平衡。Aen Seidhe，Eladrins，在他们的独角兽盟友的帮助下，将腐败的Aen Elle赶出了Feywild和外部星球。狂猎是由这些异种生物组成的，Aen Elle，或者用他们的语言说是 \"Alders的人\"。他们把艾拉德林和他们的精灵后代称为Aen Seidhe，以区别于他们的文化传统。众所周知，他们对他们的艾拉德林表亲、他们的精灵后裔和天人，尤其是独角兽有着深深的憎恨。",
	"Many renowned scholar's studies have shown that our world is not the center of the multiverse, but one of a thousand globes in the endless darkness of space. This space is usually described as a vacuum - in which, {@condition invisible} to the naked eye, lies the White Frost. Thanks to the observations of astronomers, we know the White Frost has already destroyed a great many worlds. The star systems in which it appears perish into lifeless hunks of ice over the course of a few decades. Furthermore, each scholar is agreed that the White Frost will one day come to our world. Ithlinne's Prophecy, though based on magic intuition and not scientific observation, thus appears to foretell the truth.": "许多知名学者的研究表明，我们的世界不是多元宇宙的中心，而是无尽黑暗空间中的一千颗球之一。这个空间通常被描述为真空--其中，肉眼可见的（%0%）是白霜。由于天文学家的观察，我们知道白霜已经摧毁了大量的世界。它所出现的恒星系统在几十年的时间里就会变成无生命的冰块。此外，每个学者都同意，白霜有一天会来到我们的世界。Ithlinne的预言，虽然是基于魔法的直觉而不是科学的观察，但似乎预示着事实。",

	"With unprecedented magic, the Aen Elle were casted away, cursed out of the celestial planes, the Feywild and the multiverse on its own. An entire race left to fade away outside the bounds of reality, into the void. But this was not meant to be the end of the Aen Elle. The fey resurfaced after untold times, drained of their magical souls, only the frozen void filling the empty space. Embracing the darkness, they became the herald of one of the most destructive force in the known multiverse, the void lurking between the stars, the end of all things, the White Frost. Channeling the power of the void, their navigators could revert the curse and bring them back into the multiverse.": "以前所未有的魔法，Aen Elle被赶走了，被诅咒出了天界、Feywild和多元宇宙本身。整个种族被留在现实的界限之外，消逝在虚空中。但这并不意味着Aen Elle的结束。费伊人在无数次之后重新出现，他们的魔法灵魂被吸干，只有冰冷的空洞填补了空旷的空间。拥抱黑暗，他们成为已知多元宇宙中最具破坏性的力量之一的预言家，潜伏在星星之间的虚空，万物的终结者，白霜。通过引导虚空的力量，他们的领航员可以逆转诅咒，将他们带回多元宇宙。",
	"Upon learning of their true nature many ponder how the warrior of the Wild Hunt became such juggernauts, straying so far from their delicate cousins. The answer might lie in their profane consumption of souls, fueling their might. When they returned from the void, the Aen Elle came back as hollow shells, craving the feelings and emotions the White Frost stripped away. They can only briefly feel alive though the souls of others, feeding it to the devouring void inside them, allowing them to exist a while longer until the emptiness finally consumes them all.": "在了解到他们的真实本性后，许多人都在思考，狂猎的战士是如何成为这样的巨无霸的，与他们娇弱的表亲相差如此之远。答案可能在于他们对灵魂的亵渎性消耗，为他们的力量提供了动力。当他们从虚空中回来时，Aen Elle就像一个空壳，渴望着被白霜剥离的感觉和情感。他们只能通过他人的灵魂短暂地感受到生命的存在，把它喂给他们体内的吞噬性虚空，让他们多存在一段时间，直到空虚最终把他们全部吞噬。",
	"Those enslaved by the Wild Hunt are brought to their stronghold of Tir na Lia, rumored to be located somewhere in the Astral Sea or the Frostfell. The frozen Tir na Lia was founded on the corpse of a dead god, its spires constantly battered by psychic winds, echoing the sound of the tortured. There, their captives are slowly drained of their souls through excruciating tortures, carnal sins or soul-crushing toiling, building their fleet of naglfar ships. Once souless, most turn into a statue of ice, but some survive the process and are released, useless and demented, babbling constantly about the coming of the White Frost.": "那些被狂猎奴役的人被带到他们的据点Tir na Lia，据传位于星海或冰霜地带的某处。冰冻的蒂尔纳利亚建立在一具死去的神的尸体上，它的尖顶不断受到灵力风的冲击，回荡着受折磨者的声音。在那里，他们的俘虏通过痛苦的折磨、肉体上的罪恶或灵魂上的折磨，慢慢地被抽走灵魂，建造他们的纳格法尔船队。一旦失去灵魂，大多数人就会变成一尊冰雕，但有些人在这一过程中幸存下来并被释放，他们毫无用处，精神错乱，不断地唠叨着白霜的到来。",
	"Most folks believe the Wild Hunt to be a horde of specters, but the truth is far more bizarre than one could imagine, they are in fact a sort of psychic projection, powered by the will of dozens of fey warriors joining in a chorus of minds that reaches through planes and dimensions. Through the guidance of a navigator, the warriors of the Hunt shape their will into a spectral looking horde. The Hunt can travel vast distances in this fashion, and even abduct creatures from other planes. However, this show of will is not without risk for the warriors, for the psychic feedback can be deadly, plunging them into {@condition unconscious}ness for days or killing them outright.": "大多数人认为狂猎是一群幽灵，但事实远比人们想象的要离奇，他们实际上是一种精神投射，由几十名费伊族战士的意志驱动，加入到穿越平面和维度的心灵合唱中。通过领航员的指导，猎魔团的战士们将他们的意志塑造成一个幽灵般的部落。猎杀团可以用这种方式旅行很远的距离，甚至可以从其他位面绑架生物。然而，这种意志的展示对战士们来说并非没有风险，因为精神反馈可能是致命的，会使他们陷入几天的无知状态或直接死亡。",
	"The beginning of a Hunt is not something undertaken lightly, the warriors gather ritually on the deck of the Naglfar ship and, under the supervision of their navigator, enter a deep trance state.

In the largest Hunts, when the king partakes, the crew of several ships merge mind, their psychic might bolstered by the presence of the king of the Wild Hunt. To reach through other planes the naglfar needs to be in the Astral Sea, near a color pool leading to the desired plane.": "狩猎的开始不是轻而易举的，勇士们在纳格法尔船的甲板上隆重集会，在导航员的监督下，进入深度恍惚状态。当战士们敞开心扉的时候，领航员则引导星海的精神之风的躁动能量。在最大的狩猎活动中，当国王参与其中时，几艘船的船员会合并思想，他们的精神力量因狂猎国王的存在而得到加强。要通过其他位面到达，纳格法尔需要在星海中，靠近通往所需位面的色池。",

Any damage or other effects that apply to the spectral hunt have no effect on the warriors's physical body, nor do they persist when they return to it. The spectral hunt can remain for 1 hour, until it or all its participants die, or until the navigator dismisses it as a bonus action.

	"During their travels through the planes, the Wild Hunt learned the secret allowing them to build their naglfar astral vessels, ships that protect them from the raging psychic winds of the Astral Plane. The naglfar are built by their many slaves out of the fingers and toe-nails of the dead, its hull is encased in supernatural ice and its sails made of flayed humanoid skin. A naglfar has no helm, for it is only guided by a navigator that \"speaks\" to the many souls trapped into the ship. These vessels and their crew of warriors often cross steel with other denizens of the Astral Plane, especially the githyanki, who they battle constantly with for supremacy over the Astral Sea.": "在穿越各个星球的过程中，狂猎学会了一个秘密，使他们能够建造他们的纳格法尔星际船，这艘船可以保护他们免受星界汹涌的精神之风的影响。纳格法是由他们的许多奴隶用死者的手指和脚趾甲建造的，它的船体被超自然的冰包裹着，船帆由剥落的人形皮肤制成。纳戈尔法没有舵手，因为它只由一个导航员引导，导航员会与被困在船上的许多灵魂 \"对话\"。这些船只和它们的战士船员经常与星界的其他居民交手，特别是与吉提安基人交手，他们为争夺星界之海的霸权而不断战斗。",
	"The naglfars are more than mere astral vessels, it is said that every slave that built it was slowly drained of its soul by the diabolical vessel, granting it a primitive consciousness and a thirst for souls. Simply standing near the ship can tear apart the mind of a creature, driving it into a magical coma. Imbued with the magic of the White Frost, the naglfar can summon supernatural cold, but it reveals its true potential as a magical catalyst for the powers wielded by navigators, allowing them to breach through dimensions or to tap into its almost limitless well of souls to fuel their spells.": "naglfars不仅仅是单纯的星体容器，据说每一个建造它的奴隶都被这个邪恶的容器慢慢吸干了灵魂，赋予了它原始的意识和对灵魂的渴求。只要站在船的附近，就能撕裂一个生物的心灵，使其陷入魔法昏迷。被白霜的魔力所感染，纳格法尔可以召唤超自然的寒冷，但它作为导航员所挥舞的力量的魔法催化剂，揭示了其真正的潜力，允许他们突破维度或利用其几乎无限的灵魂之井来推动他们的法术。",
	"A spectral hunt of this size represents usually half the crew of a Naglfar ship, or a smaller vessel. The Hunt will typically target a small settlement or an isolated town, raiding and killing swiftly, barely stopping, and vanishing as suddenly as they appeared, taking a few prisoners with them. Such raid leaves no chances of reaction from the defenders, striking with speed and fury.": "这种规模的幽灵猎手通常代表着Naglfar船的一半船员，或者更小的船只。猎魔团通常会以小型定居点或孤立的城镇为目标，迅速突袭和杀戮，几乎不做任何停留，然后像他们出现时一样突然消失，并带走一些囚犯。这种突袭不给防御者留下任何反应的机会，以速度和愤怒进行打击。",
	"A war host gather the combined efforts of several ships, requiring a great deal of concentration and collaboration from several navigators on their respective naglfar. A war host manifests as an unstoppable wave of wraith riders, stretching to the horizon in the night sky. Typically, such demonstration of strength is leaded by the spectral king itself, charging at the front of its spectral army. Gathering of this significance are rare, only happening in times of great war or disaster as the Wild Hunt can hear the call of a great many souls, ready for the harvest.": "一艘战舰集合了几艘战舰的力量，需要几位航海家在各自的纳格法上进行大量的集中和协作。战船表现为一波不可阻挡的幽灵骑士，在夜空中延伸到地平线。通常情况下，这种力量的展示是由幽灵王自己领导的，在其幽灵军队的前面冲锋陷阵。如此重要的集会是罕见的，只发生在巨大的战争或灾难时期，因为狂猎可以听到大量灵魂的呼唤，准备收获。",
	"No enemy is more terrifying than the spectral king, who leads a horde of ghastly riders across the sky. Doom incarnate, he fears no opponent, for he can always decide that his adversary is doomed, which usually determines the outcome of any clash. Many suggest he is either an archfey or an archwraith. Beneath his ragged robes, he wears elements of an ancient suit of armor. The ornaments on his clothing and crown evoke associations with bones and death.

	"The ancestral hatred that exists between the Wild Hunt and the unicorns dates back to events that occurred in time immemorial. Somewhere in the weave of the multiverse lies Ard Gaeth the Gate of Worlds. The gods tasked the pure unicorns to keep the gate shut, keeping realities and worlds separated. Through trickery and conquest, the king of the Alders once forced the unicorns to open Ard Gaeth, seeking to use its power. Realizing their foolish plan that might have endangered the entire multiverse, the unicorns called on the magic of the eladrins to banish the Aen Elle through Ard Gaeth into the void.": "狂猎和独角兽之间存在的祖先的仇恨可以追溯到远古时期发生的事件。在多元宇宙的某处，坐落着世界之门Ard Gaeth。诸神责成纯正的独角兽守住大门，保持现实和世界的分离。通过诡计和征服，阿尔德人的国王曾经强迫独角兽们打开阿德盖斯，试图使用它的力量。独角兽们意识到他们愚蠢的计划可能会危及整个多元宇宙，于是召唤了艾拉德林的魔法，将艾恩-艾尔通过阿德-盖斯驱逐到虚空中。",

The king of the Wild Hunt took upon himself to rebuild the city, and to claim a new home for the Aen Elle to endure the destruction and rebirth of the world. The Dearg Ruadhri's distorted memory and frigid hearts prevents them from remembering the delicate and sophisticated beauty of Tyr na Lia. To compensate for their lack of creative beauty, the Hunt deals with creatures that can spark emotions through magic. In their dealings, they favor trade with succubi, devils, crones, and hags. For the same purpose, the Hunt kidnaps elven artists, especially architects, nymphs, satyrs, dryads, or even angels. Tragically, the constant torment they inflict on their captives' souls saps the very inspiration they need to create, making the task nigh impossible.": "Tyr na Lia，曾经宏伟的Aen Elle的家园已经不复存在，在时间和空间中消失。荒野狩猎的国王自告奋勇地重建了这座城市，并为Aen Elle要求一个新的家园，以忍受世界的毁灭和重生。Dearg Ruadhri人扭曲的记忆和冰冷的心使他们无法记住Tyr na Lia的精致和复杂之美。为了弥补他们缺乏创造性的美感，猎魔团与那些能通过魔法激发情感的生物打交道。在他们的交易中，他们偏向于与 succubi、魔鬼、老妪和女巫进行交易。出于同样的目的，猎杀团绑架了精灵艺术家，特别是建筑师、仙女、萨提尔、干尸，甚至是天使。可悲的是，他们对俘虏的灵魂所施加的持续折磨，削弱了他们创作所需的灵感，使任务几乎不可能完成。",

Tormentors are completely unconcerned with the ideals of the Wild Hunt, for naught is left of their personality, and they care nothing for the fate of the Aen Elle or their past. Many turn \"traitors\", disassociated with the Wild Hunt and taking on their own, only interested in hasting the coming of the White Frost and feeding their insatiable hunger. Navigators especially despise them, for the weakness they showed and the wasted potential they represent.

Tormentors use their insidious powers to fashion partially real substitute of a creature, formed from ice or snow, and infused with a fragment of the creature's soul. These fetches, as they are called, take the place of a creature, living its life as the creature would have until its master requires its service. Fetches are often released after raids, pretending to be returning survivors, spreading fear and misinformation on the Wild Hunt.

Elementals of the White Frost are rarely found outside of frozen regions, for they thrive in cold climates, still, some talented conjurer might bend one to its will and summon it in unusual places. Outside of tundra and glaciers they can alternatively be found in the Wild Hunt's wake, reveling in its path of destruction.": "人们对称为白霜的元素力量知之甚少。它无形无质，在已知多元宇宙的边界徘徊，或在霜冻之城的永恒冰层中显现。很少有生物能在它的触摸下存活下来，只有少数元素物种是由它的有害力量创造的。白霜元素很少在冰冻地区以外的地方被发现，因为它们在寒冷的气候中茁壮成长，不过，一些有天赋的魔法师可能会让它们屈服于自己的意志，在不寻常的地方召唤它们。在苔原和冰川之外，它们也可以在狂猎之后被发现，在它的毁灭之路上狂欢。",

	"During an ambush, an ice wraith usually waits for a prey to pass by, blending perfectly with its environment. When it attacks, it inflicts as much damage as it can before retreating as quickly as it appeared. It is an extremely agile creature; moving through the air with slithering motions that makes it very difficult to hit at range, and once it enters melee it is incredibly evasive. It slithers in and out of reach with fearsome unpredictability, striking fast and then withdrawing out of reach again. If it meets some resistance it will disappear in the wilderness for a time, letting its bite weaken the wounded before returning.": "在伏击过程中，冰封女巫通常会等待猎物经过，与环境完美融合。当它攻击时，它尽可能地造成伤害，然后像出现时一样迅速撤退。它是一种极其敏捷的生物；在空气中以滑行的方式移动，这使得它很难在范围内被击中，而一旦进入近战，它的躲避能力就非常强。它以可怕的不可预测性滑进滑出，快速出击，然后再次退回到无法触及的地方。如果它遇到一些抵抗，它会在荒野中消失一段时间，让它的咬伤削弱伤者，然后再回来。",
	"Unless compelled to, ice wraiths do not serve the Wild Hunt, but can often be seen at the site of an ongoing raid, feeding on the stragglers and the survivors.

If the legends are to be believed, Jörmungandr was a serpent so large that it wrapped itself around the world, plunging it into an ice age. When it was defeated by the gods, it shattered into thousands of ice shards.

Their serpentine body is barely visible under any circumstances, as if they were only slightly peering through reality. Their disincarnated nature allows them to shift from plane to plane in an instant, making them extremely difficult to fight by conventional means. Perhaps even more frightening is their ability to form the ouroboros, the ring of frost. When a jörmungandr bites its own tail, it opens a rift of freezing elemental energy, swallowing any unfortunate soul close to the monster. Few have ever escaped from the rift, but their testimony is always terrifying. Some believe this is how the world will end one day, when all the jörmungandr will gather in the sky, reforming the World Serpent and consume everything in a ring of frost.": "Jörmungandrs明显比普通的冰雪精灵大，有些传言说有鲸鱼或小龙那么大。他们的蛇形身体在任何情况下都几乎看不出来，就像他们只是稍微窥视了一下现实。他们的脱胎换骨的特性使他们能够在瞬间从一个平面转移到另一个平面，这使得他们极难用常规手段来对抗。也许更可怕的是，他们有能力形成乌罗波洛斯，即冰霜之环。当Jörmungandr咬住自己的尾巴时，它就会打开一个冰冻元素能量的裂缝，吞噬任何靠近怪物的不幸的灵魂。很少有人能从裂缝中逃出来，但他们的证词总是令人恐惧。有些人认为这就是世界末日的样子，当所有的jörmungandr将聚集在天空中，重组世界之蛇，并在一个冰霜的环中吞噬一切。",

When fighting an arch-wraith one should always remember what failures means: the enslavement of one's soul for eternity.": "许多人认为，大巫师的巨大力量来自于其拒绝灵魂进入来世的能力，将其困在不死不休的状态中，为人所奴役。一些最强大的大巫师困住了成百上千的灵魂，甚至成千上万，无休止地重复着导致大巫师出现的悲惨事件。在与大巫师战斗时，人们应该永远记住失败意味着什么：一个人的灵魂被永恒地奴役。",

A crumbling keep in a forest of tombstones, a flesh cathedral surrounded by hundreds of worshiping souls, a bone-made spire topping a jagged cliff, all are possible lairs.": "一个拱形巫师站在它的恐惧之域的中心。巫师的堡垒可以有很多形状，这取决于它生前是谁。墓碑林中摇摇欲坠的堡垒、被数百个崇拜的灵魂包围的肉体大教堂、在锯齿状悬崖上的骨制尖顶，都是可能的巢穴。",
	"The land under an arch-wraith's influence contains a supernatural mist, hanging between the world men see and the one they cannot. By stepping into the mist, a shadow crossing really, one can break through the veil between worlds and enter the arch-wraith's Domain of Dread in the Shadowfell. The domain is entirely under the arch-wraith control, making it a god-like entity in its kingdom, a god trapped in its own tragic story. As for the rest of the Shadowfell, the domain is a twisted and warped-distorted reflections of the region haunted by the wraith. The domain is an infinite expanse, expanding far beyond the geographical limits of its Material Plane equivalent.": "在大巫师的影响下，土地上有一种超自然的迷雾，悬挂在人们看到的世界和他们看不到的世界之间。通过踏入迷雾，一个真正的影子穿越，人们可以突破世界之间的面纱，进入大巫师在影域的恐惧之域。这个领域完全在大巫师的控制之下，使其成为其王国中类似于神的实体，一个被困在自己悲剧故事中的神。至于暗影城的其他地方，该领域是被大巫师困扰的地区的扭曲和变形的反映。该领域是一个无边无际的广袤地带，远远超出了物质世界的地理限制。",
	"Undead creatures can cross in and out the mist at will, but when doing so they are not driven by reason and logic, but by a thoughtless, irrational need, carrying the will of the arch-wraith.": "亡灵生物可以随意进出迷雾，但在这样做的时候，它们不是被理性和逻辑所驱使，而是被一种不假思索的、非理性的需求所驱使，承载着大巫师的意志。",
	"A living creature entering the mist must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, incapable of leaving the domain of dread by simply walking out of the mist. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mist's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically. Creatures trapped in the mist don't age. A creature trapped within the domain can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the domain until freed.": "进入迷雾的生物必须在DC 15的魅力投掷中取得成功，否则就会被困住，无法通过简单地走出迷雾而离开恐惧之域。如果该生物知道迷雾的性质，则该救赎动作是有优势的，而结构体的救赎动作自动成功。被困在迷雾中的生物不会衰老。被困在该领域内的生物可以使用允许平面旅行的魔法逃脱。否则，该生物将被限制在该领域内，直到被释放。",
	"The gloomy atmosphere and almost tangible despair that seeps through the domain affects all living creatures stepping through it. Creature must resist the Shadowfell Despair (see p. 51 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) after only an hour passed in the domain of dread.": "阴暗的气氛和几乎是有形的绝望渗入这个领域，影响到所有踏过它的生物。生物在恐惧之域中只过了一个小时，就必须抵御阴影之域的绝望（见《地下城主指南》第51页）。",
	"The soul of a creature dying in the domain of dread becomes trapped here, joining the ranks of the enslaved wraith and specters serving the arch-wraith. Until the arch-wraith is destroyed permanently the creature cannot be resurrected or brought back to life by any mean, unless the arch-wraith is willing to bargain for it (see the Bargain).": "在恐惧之域死亡的生物的灵魂会被困在这里，加入被奴役的巫师和为大巫师服务的幽灵的行列。在大巫师被永久摧毁之前，该生物无法复活或以任何方式复活，除非大巫师愿意为其讨价还价（见讨价还价）。",
	"Tales of heroes braving countless dangers to rescue their true love from the clutch of an archwraith abode for a reason. The only known way to free the souls captured by the monster is to slay it, an impossible task for most mortals, or to bargain with it. These tails always end up tragically, the hero striking an impossible deal with the creature in hope to save their beloved. In theory though, it is possible, after overcoming many challenges, to bargain for a specific soul with the arch-wraith. The wraith will always put nearly impossible conditions to fulfill if it agrees (see Terms of the Bargain for examples). Once the bargain is made, the archwraith can use its magic to cast a true resurrection spell. If the bargain's terms are broken the resurrected creatures crumbles to dust and the arch-wraith is free to raise the soul into one of its most powerful servant, a remnant.": "英雄们冒着无数危险从大巫师的魔掌中拯救他们的真爱的故事是有原因的。唯一已知的释放被怪物捕获的灵魂的方法是杀死它，这对大多数凡人来说是不可能完成的任务，或者与它讨价还价。这些交易总是以悲剧收场，英雄与怪物达成了不可能的交易，希望能拯救他们的爱人。不过从理论上讲，在克服了许多挑战之后，有可能与大巫师讨价还价，获得一个特定的灵魂。如果同意的话，大巫师总是会提出一些几乎不可能实现的条件（例子见 \"交易条款\"）。一旦达成交易，大巫师就可以用它的魔法施展真正的复活咒语。如果交易条件被破坏，复活的生物就会化为尘土，大巫师就可以自由地将灵魂提升为它最强大的仆人之一，即残余者。",
	"A remnant is a powerful undead reanimated by an archwraith with the power of a broken bargain. Sometimes called draugir, remnants are usually death knights, revenants, wights or even, in rare cases, mummies. Remnants are keeping their personality and memories but are twisted by the arch-wraith's power, always turning evil. These creatures live to torment the ones that made a bargain to free their soul from the clutch of an arch-wraith but failed ultimately, breaking the terms. The remnant is identical to its usual type of undead and gains the following features:": "残余者是由大巫师用破碎交易的力量复活的强大亡灵。残余者有时也被称为 \"draugir\"，通常是死亡骑士、复仇者、巫师，甚至在少数情况下是木乃伊。残余者保持着他们的个性和记忆，但被大巫师的力量所扭曲，总是变得邪恶。这些生物活着就是为了折磨那些为了将自己的灵魂从大巫师的魔掌中解放出来而做了交易，但最终失败了，破坏了条款。残余物与它通常的亡灵类型相同，并获得以下特征。",
	"The remnant has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws against the creature that made the bargain to save it. The creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls and saving throws made against the remnant.": "残余物在攻击卷轴和对做出拯救它的生物的蓄力投掷上具有优势。该生物对残余物的所有攻击卷和蓄力攻击都处于劣势。",
	"The remnant knows the distance to and direction of any creature that made the bargain to save it, even if the creature and the remnant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the remnant dies, the remnant knows.": "残存者知道任何为拯救它而进行交易的生物的距离和方向，即使该生物和残存者是在不同的存在平面。如果被残存者追踪的生物死亡，残存者也知道。",
	"A remnant can arise anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when its soul has been freed from the arch-wraith can it be truly destroyed.": "即使在被摧毁之后，一个残余的东西也能重新出现。只有当它的灵魂从大巫师那里得到解脱时，它才能真正被摧毁。",
	"The creature must leave the Domain without sleeping or sustaining itself. If it sleeps, eats or drinks it will suffer from amnesia, forgetting his entire past with the person it came to save. The domain of dread will expand almost indefinitely, tempting it along the way as the climate and the journey become increasingly harsher.": "该生物必须在不睡觉或不维持自己的情况下离开该领域。如果它睡觉、吃东西或喝水，它就会患上失忆症，忘记他和它来拯救的人的整个过去。恐惧之域几乎会无限扩大，随着气候和旅程变得越来越严酷，沿途诱惑着它。",
	"The creature must take a cursed artefact, connected to the arch-wraith story, outside the domain. Doing so allows the wraith to expand its influence over a new region.": "该生物必须将一件与大巫师的故事有关的被诅咒的艺术品带到域外。这样做可以让大巫师在一个新的地区扩大其影响力。",
	"The creature must leave the domain of dread in a limited time, with only just enough time to do so if it hurries. Dangerous obstacles will appear along the way, with a safer but longer alternative offered to avoid them.": "该生物必须在有限的时间内离开可怕的领域，如果它匆匆忙忙，只有足够的时间这样做。沿途会出现危险的障碍物，并提供更安全但更长的选择来避免它们。",
	"Every morning the creature will die, while its loved one is resurrected. Every evening the loved one will die, as the creature is resurrected. The two will only cross path briefly for a minute while they trade places in life or death.": "每天早上，生物会死亡，而它所爱的人却复活了。每天晚上，所爱的人都会死亡，而生物则会复活。当他们在生死中交换位置时，这两个人只会有一分钟的短暂交集。",
	"The character can never name or look at the dead person, otherwise she will disappear as dust taken by a supernatural wind.": "角色永远不能叫出死者的名字或看着她，否则她会像被超自然的风带走的灰尘一样消失。",
	"Cenokian wraiths, or simply cenokians, are spectral horrors of former necromancers and sorcerers that used the corrupting influence of necromancy to extend their lives beyond the mortal limit. In their hubris they have defied the god of death's authority by preventing the inevitability of their passing and continued to do so even in the afterlife. Others made a deal with the beings of the Shadowfell known as the Dark Powers and were tricked into an impossible bargain, some were unworthy servants of the Demon Prince Orcus and are forever guarding his realm of Thanatos. As a punishment, decay took their mortal forms, rotting it away even as they sought desperately to sustain it. With no corporeal form to speak of, these men and women became wandering spirits, clad only in their death shrouds. As their grip on the world of mortals weakened, these vagrant souls were bound to be the eternal keepers of the cycle of life and death, reaping those that would attempt to escape their fate.": "Cenokian wraiths，或简称为cenokians，是前死灵法师和巫师的幽灵般的恐怖，他们利用死灵法术的腐蚀影响，将自己的生命延长到凡人的极限之外。在他们的傲慢中，他们藐视死亡之神的权威，阻止他们不可避免的死亡，甚至在来世也继续这样做。另一些人与被称为黑暗势力的阴影地带的众生做了交易，并被骗入一个不可能的交易中，有些人是恶魔王子奥卡斯的不值得的仆人，永远守护着他的塔纳托斯领域。作为一种惩罚，腐烂夺走了他们的凡人形态，甚至在他们拼命寻求维持的时候，腐烂了它。由于没有肉体的形式可言，这些男人和女人变成了游魂，只穿着他们的死亡罩子。随着他们对凡人世界的控制力减弱，这些游荡的灵魂注定要成为生死轮回的永恒守护者，收割那些试图逃避命运的人。",
	"Until they are called to collect a specific soul, cenokian wraiths are bound to a cenote, a soul-trapping portal that was build long ago by unknown entities. Theories abound as to the exact nature of these gates and the symbiosis that connects them to the wraiths. Divination attempts bears no result and even the lips of the gods are sealed when it comes to the topic. Some view these wraith as psychopomps, severing the last ties between the soul and the body. What is certain is that attempting to resurrect a person is a sure way to gain the wraith's ire and to be marked by the culling curse. Those that inhabit the lands tainted by a cenote have learned to fear the consequences of resurrection magic and have strictly forbidden its use and teaching, going as far as to outlaw any material components that might be used to cast such spells.": "在被召唤去收集一个特定的灵魂之前，塞诺克裹尸人被束缚在一个塞诺特，一个很久以前由未知实体建造的灵魂陷阱入口。关于这些门的确切性质以及连接它们和裹尸人的共生关系的理论比比皆是。占卜的尝试没有结果，甚至连诸神的嘴唇在谈到这个话题时也是密封的。有些人认为这些裹尸人是精神炸弹，切断了灵魂和身体之间的最后联系。可以肯定的是，试图复活一个人肯定会引起裹尸人的愤怒，并被剔除的诅咒所标记。那些居住在被沼泽地污染的土地上的人已经学会了害怕复活魔法的后果，并严格禁止使用和教授复活魔法，甚至将任何可能用于施放此类法术的物质成分列为非法。"
