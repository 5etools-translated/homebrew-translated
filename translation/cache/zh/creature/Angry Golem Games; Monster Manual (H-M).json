	"When adventuring companies journey into the wilderness they often run into {@creature ogre|AGGMM3}s; big, ugly humanoids. Occasionally, an ogre party will include one or two individuals that are a little shorter, but significantly smarter, wielding a weapon with more skill than might have been expected. They have a better understanding of their opponents, and they grunt commands that anticipate the adventurers' moves. In this way half-breeds, the issue of ogres and humans, earn the respect of their kind.": "当冒险公司在野外旅行时，他们经常会遇到{@creature ogre|AGGMM3}的人；大而丑陋的人形生物。偶尔，食人魔队伍中会有一两个人，他们稍微矮一点，但明显更聪明，挥舞武器的技巧超过预期。他们对自己的对手有更好的了解，他们咕哝着命令，预测冒险者的动作。通过这种方式，混血儿，食人魔和人类的问题，赢得了同类的尊重。",
	"Half-ogres range from 7 to 8 feet in height and weigh from 315 to 425 pounds. Skin and hair color are variable, but tend toward brown, gray, black, dull yellow (skin only), or any of the above with a slight gray-green tint. Teeth and nails are always orange. Most half-ogres have human-like eyes, though about one in five have the white pupils common to ogres. Their odor is noticeable, but it is not as overpowering as that of a full-blooded ogre.": "半兽人的身高从7到8英尺不等，体重从315磅到425磅。皮肤和头发的颜色是可变的，但倾向于棕色、灰色、黑色、暗黄色（仅皮肤），或上述任何一种都带有轻微的灰绿色调。牙齿和指甲总是橙色的。大多数半食人魔都有一双类似人类的眼睛，不过大约五分之一的人有食人魔常见的白色瞳孔。他们的气味很明显，但不像全血食人魔的气味那么强烈。",
	"HABITAT / SOCIETY": "人居环境/社会",
	"Half-ogres have no society of their own. If they live with ogres, they are the quick-thinking members of the tribe, ever on their toes to prove themselves worthy.

	"Occasionally, half-ogres join with half-orcs, orogs, ogrillons, and other humanoids. These communities are small (5-200 residents) and usually isolated, but can appear in virtually any terrain. Half-ogres fill a middle niche — more powerful than half-orcs or orogs, but smarter than ogrillons, trolls, and other humanoids. As a whole, these communities are chaotic evil, with neutral tendencies stemming from the level of cooperation necessary in a \"half-caste\" situation. They prefer others of their own kind, and are tolerant of orcs and ogres. Enough of them have human blood that they regard humans with neutrality.": "偶尔，半兽人也会与半兽人、兽人、奥格瑞隆和其他人形生物结合。这些社区很小（5-200名居民），通常是孤立的，但几乎可以出现在任何地形上。半兽人填补了一个中间位置--比半兽人或兽人更强大，但比奥格瑞隆、巨魔和其他人形生物更聪明。作为一个整体，这些族群是混乱的邪恶，中立的倾向源于 \"半种姓 \"情况下必要的合作水平。他们更喜欢自己的同类，而对兽人和食人魔则持宽容态度。他们中足够多的人有人类血统，所以他们对人类持中立态度。",
	"Indeed, chaotic evil humans often find their most enthusiastic followers in such a hybrid tribe. They also tolerate monstrous humanoids such as trolls and giants, but all other races are treated with undisguised hostility.": "事实上，混沌邪恶的人类经常在这样的混合部落中找到他们最热心的追随者。他们也容忍巨魔和巨人等畸形的人形生物，但对所有其他种族都抱有毫不掩饰的敌意。",
	"Hybrid settlements raid civilized territories for prisoners and loot. A settlement may be found holding prisoners. It is also likely for treasure to be found in a hybrid camp. Half-ogres are usually cheated out of most of their rightful treasure shares by the more cunning orogs and half-orcs.": "混合定居点突袭文明地区，以获取囚犯和战利品。一个定居点可能会被发现关押囚犯。在混血儿的营地里也有可能发现宝藏。半兽人通常会被更狡猾的兽人和半兽人骗走大部分他们应得的财宝。",
	"ECOLOGY": "生态学",
	"Sages have expressed much concern over the years, wondering why ogres can interbreed with humans but not with elves or halflings. When the actual answer was discovered, the sages' concerns proved unfounded. The explanation had nothing to do with any supposed common origin of humans and ogres, but rather in a unusual characteristic that ogres share with orcs: rapidly adaptive biology. Just as orcs and ogres can adapt quickly to any terrain, from forests to the highest mountains, their genetic construction allows them breed with any humanoid race.": "多年来，圣人表达了许多担忧，他们想知道为什么食人魔能与人类杂交，却不能与精灵或半身人杂交。当真正的答案被发现时，圣贤们的担忧被证明是没有根据的。这个解释与任何所谓的人类和食人魔的共同起源无关，而是食人魔与兽人共有的一个不寻常的特征：快速适应性生物学。正如兽人和食人魔可以迅速适应任何地形，从森林到最高的山峰，他们的基因结构允许他们与任何类人种族繁殖。",
	"This ability to breed easily is frequently passed on to their progeny. Half-ogres can also breed successfully with most other humanoid races. If this process continues for many generations, the result is a horrible hybrid known as a mongrelman. Many mongrelmen have strong strains of orc and ogre in their bloodlines, which may account for their chaotic evil attitudes.": "这种容易繁殖的能力经常会传给他们的后代。半食人魔也能与大多数其他人形种族成功繁殖。如果这个过程持续了很多代，结果就是一个可怕的混血儿，被称为杂种人。许多杂种人的血统中都有强烈的兽人和食人魔的血统，这可能是他们混乱的邪恶态度的原因。",
	"The half-ogre shares the ogre's place in the ecosystem: that of a plague upon demihumans and humans, lusting for treasure and making neither crafts nor good labor. The beginnings of half-ogre poetry have been around for many years, but it is exceptionally ugly and disturbing.": "半食人魔在生态系统中的地位与食人魔相同：它是半人和人类的瘟疫，贪图财宝，既不做手艺，也不做好的劳动。半食人魔诗歌的雏形已经存在了很多年，但它异常丑陋，令人不安。",
	"A hangman tree can release a hallucinatory perfume at will, and it does so when prey is within range of tremorsens.

	"When the Hangman Tree hit a victim with a vine, the the vine tightens and lifts its prey to the opening in the upper trunk. The target can make only one strenght check {@dc 20} to break free; victims who fail the roll cannot escape. The victim is dropped into the hangman tree's stomach and suffers {@dice 3d4 + 12} points of acid damage per round until dead, and is then digested. Escape from the stomach is impossible. Many sharp growths surround the top of the opening, they point inward and down. About three man-sized victims can fit in the tree's stomach at one time.": "当刽子手树用藤蔓击中受害者时，藤蔓会收紧并将猎物举到树干上部的开口处。目标只能做一次强度检查（%0%）来挣脱；未能通过检查的受害者无法逃脱。受害者被扔进吊死鬼树的胃里，每回合受到1%的酸液伤害，直到死亡，然后被消化掉。从胃中逃脱是不可能的。许多尖锐的生长物围绕着开口的顶部，它们指向内侧和下方。在树的胃里一次可以容纳大约三个人大小的受害者。",
	"This tree is named for its noose-like vines. Hangman trees are deciduous, resembling thick oaks with few branches and sparse foliage. Knot-like sensory organs are usually located high on the trunk.": "这种树因其绞索状的藤蔓而得名。刽子手树是落叶树，类似于粗大的橡树，树枝少，叶子稀疏。绳结状的感觉器官通常位于树干的高处。",
	"In the area where the tree's main branches split off, there is an opening which leads to the creature's acid-filled \"stomach.\" The lower trunk has a slash-like opening for the expulsion of indigestibles. Saplings can move at 6 feet an hour, while older trees can move only 2 feet an hour.": "在树的主枝分叉的地方，有一个开口，通向生物充满酸的 \"胃\"。树干下部有一个类似于斜线的开口，用于排出不消化的食物。小树苗可以以每小时6英尺的速度移动，而老树每小时只能移动2英尺。",
	"Their shallow root systems and small number of leaves require them to supplement their diet by direct ingestion of protein, so each tree traps prey. During freezing weather, a taproot is put down and the tree is dormant.": "它们的根系较浅，叶子数量少，需要通过直接摄取蛋白质来补充食物，所以每棵树都会诱捕猎物。在冰冷的天气里，直根被放下来，树就会休眠。",
	"Those who inhale the perfume believe the hangman tree to be a normal tree, or even a treant, depending on the mood of the tree. Mature and older hangman trees can speak halting Common.": "吸入这种香水的人认为刽子手树是一种正常的树，甚至是一种树人，这取决于树的情绪。成熟和年长的刽子手树可以说停顿的普通话。",

In that eternally night-lit plane the howlers are drawn to shriek their madness to the moonless heavens": "嚎叫者是咆哮的猎犬或潘德蒙，是聚集在巨大的岩石尖顶上的痴呆歌手，在那些急剧下降的山洞里。在那永恒的夜空中，嚎叫者被吸引着向没有月亮的天空呼喊他们的疯狂。",
	"The howlers are gigantic beasts, four-legged, with the burly backs of oxen and scales glinting through their matted red fur. This fur spreads into a thick ruff of trembling quills that frame their simian faces. Their front claws are the clotted knots of coarse fingers too long crnshed under the beastly weight, their back feet are hooved. When they cry, they rock back until they almost stand and throw their muzzled faces toward the missing sky. Lips pursed into a perfect O, they howl the voices of madness.": "咆哮者是巨大的野兽，四条腿，有着牛一样粗壮的脊背，鳞片在它们的红色毛发中闪闪发光。这种毛发蔓延成厚厚的围脖，颤抖的毛发衬托着它们的类人脸。它们的前爪是粗大的手指在野兽般的重量下缩成的结节，它们的后脚有蹄。当它们哭泣时，它们会向后摇晃，直到它们几乎站立起来，并将它们戴着口罩的脸朝向失踪的天空。嘴唇抿成一个完美的O型，它们发出疯狂的嚎叫声。",
	"Howlers are beasts native to the tunnels of Pandemonium and are not naturally found on any other plane. Even within Pandemonium they aren't found everywhere. They stay far from the settled regions and the small tunnels, preferring the larger curved passages that pass for plains and grassland. On these plains they hunt in packs; for they are carnivorous scavengers.": "咆哮者是原产于潘德蒙隧道的野兽，在其他任何平面上都无法自然发现。即使在潘德蒙，它们也不是随处可见的。它们远离定居地区和小型隧道，更喜欢较大的弧形通道，即平原和草场。在这些平原上，它们成群结队地狩猎；因为它们是食肉的清道夫。",
	"There is no hard and fast size for a howler pack, as is the way of the animal kingdom. Packs range from 2 to as many as 20 members. This number includes bulls, females, and kits. (Of a pack, it is the bulls who defend the others, hence the small number met in a normal encounter) The packs scour the land. searching for anything edible. As news of their migrations travels through the tunnels, other dwellers in Pandemonium brace themselves for the agony that is sure to come.": "吼叫兽群没有硬性规定的大小，这也是动物界的惯例。狼群的规模从2只到多达20只不等。这个数字包括公狼、母狼和小狼。(在一个族群中，公牛负责保护其他成员，因此在正常情况下遇到的数量不多。)这些族群在陆地上搜寻任何可食用的东西。当它们迁徙的消息在隧道中传播时，潘德蒙的其他居民为肯定会发生的痛苦做好准备。",
	"Howlers are aptly named, for their howls cut through the whistling wind with the pitch of madness. Their cries have the same effects as the winds of Pandemonium, gradually driving those who hear them to insanity. Whenever a howler lets loose its cry, all within hearing distance, whether indoor or out, must make a check as if they were exposed to Pandemonium's winds. A howler's cry lacks the full strength of the winds their keening pitch can never push a chancier beyond Stage 3 (Hysteria). Characters who have already reached Resignation exhibit all their tics and twitches when the howlers sing. Even on other planes, a howler's effect travels with it.": "嚎叫者的名字很恰当，因为他们的嚎叫声以疯狂的音调划破呼啸的风。它们的叫声和大闹天宫的风有同样的效果，会逐渐把听到它们的人逼到精神错乱。每当嚎叫者放出它的叫声，所有在听觉范围内的人，不管是在室内还是室外，都必须做一个检查，就像他们被暴露在潘德蒙的风中一样。嚎叫者的哭声缺乏风的全部力量，他们的咆哮音调永远不会把一个陈腐者推到第三阶段（歇斯底里）之外。当嚎叫者唱歌时，已经达到辞世的角色会表现出他们所有的抽搐和颤抖。即使在其他星球上，嚎叫者的效果也会随着它而传播。",
	"It is fortunate that howlers don't bay all the time. In that regard they are more like common dogs. They howl and keen occasionally, when the circumstances are right. As pack animals, they howl when they are lonely kept in the stable apart from their masters, for example. They howl during the rutting season and when their territory is challenged. They howl when cornered. The DM has final say over when the beasts bay to the blackness.": "幸运的是，嚎叫者并不是一直在海湾。在这一点上，它们更像普通的狗。当情况合适时，它们会偶尔嚎叫和热衷于此。作为群居动物，当它们与主人分开关在马厩里感到孤独时，它们会发出嚎叫。在发情期和领地受到挑战时，它们会发出嚎叫。它们在被逼无奈时也会嚎叫。DM有最终决定权，可以决定这些野兽何时向黑夜发起冲击。",
	"Howlers would be just another bane of Pandemonium were it not for those in the tunnels who can capture and tame the beasts to be good riding and pack mounts. A howler has the carrying capacity of a draft horse, and is far better adapted to traveling the twisted tunnels than a simple horse.": "如果不是隧道里的人能够捕捉并驯服这些野兽，使之成为良好的骑乘和驮运坐骑，嚎叫者将只是潘德蒙的另一个祸害。嚎叫者的运载能力相当于一匹草泥马，而且比普通的马更适合在扭曲的隧道中行走。",
	"Some wizards claim the howlers sing secrets of the planes, a code concealed in their pitch and their keening. Others think the wizards have been howled mad by their studies.": "一些巫师声称嚎叫者唱出了星球的秘密，他们的音调和吼叫中隐藏着一种密码。其他人则认为巫师们被他们的研究弄疯了。",

	"COMBAT": "战斗",
	"Sharks sense pressure changes underwater, most often caused by noises from other creatures. Thrashing about in the water always attracts sharks, since usually only wounded fish behave like that. Sharks can sense these motions from up to a mile away and once one shark discovers prey, more are soon to follow. Sharks also attack mercilessly at the scent of blood, which they can likewise detect at distances of a mile or more.": "鲨鱼能感觉到水下的压力变化，最常见的是由其他生物发出的声音引起的。在水中乱动总是会吸引鲨鱼，因为通常只有受伤的鱼会有这样的行为。鲨鱼可以在一英里外感觉到这些动作，一旦一只鲨鱼发现了猎物，更多的鲨鱼很快就会跟上。鲨鱼在闻到血腥味时也会毫不留情地攻击，它们同样可以在一英里或更远的距离察觉到。",
	"When a number of sharks gather around a bleeding victim, the scent of the blood and the thrill of the kill send all sharks into a feeding frenzy. Nothing escapes from such an attack, not even some sharks. Sharks eat anything living, even each other, during a feeding frenzy. Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat very quickly, up to four large-sized sharks can attack a man-sized opponent in the water every round.": "当一些鲨鱼聚集在一个流血的受害者周围时，血的气味和杀戮的快感使所有的鲨鱼都陷入捕食的狂潮。没有什么能从这样的攻击中逃脱，甚至一些鲨鱼也不能。鲨鱼在捕食狂潮中吃任何活物，甚至是相互之间。由于鲨鱼移动起来，咬一口肉，然后迅速撤退，所以每一轮最多可以有四条大鲨鱼在水中攻击一个人大小的对手。",
	"Sharks are pure eating and killing machines, evolving quite naturally into superior predators, and then remaining unchanged for millions of years. They are primarily scavengers, preying on the sick and wounded, but attack fresh meat if tempted to do so. They are very territorial and solitary.": "鲨鱼是纯粹的进食和杀戮机器，很自然地进化成高级掠食者，然后在数百万年里保持不变。它们主要是清道夫，捕食病人和伤员，但如果受到诱惑，也会攻击鲜肉。它们具有很强的领地性和独居性。",
	"The only friends the sharks have are the {@creature sahuagin|AGGMM3}, who appreciate the predators for their bloody, ruthless, and efficient natures. They often use sharks as guardians, mounts, sacrifices, and personal pets. The king of all sahuagin is rumored to possess a megalodon shark of largest size, which he apparently feeds quite often. Sahuagin priestesses offer all of their sacrifices to pure white great white sharks of largest size, that are often decorated in collars of gold and silver.": "鲨鱼唯一的朋友是{@creature sahuagin|AGGMM3}，他们欣赏捕食者的血腥、无情和高效的天性。他们经常使用鲨鱼作为守护者、坐骑、祭品和个人宠物。据传，所有萨瓦金人的国王拥有一条最大尺寸的巨齿鲨，他显然经常喂食这条鲨鱼。萨瓦金女祭司把所有的祭品都献给了最大尺寸的纯白大白鲨，这些鲨鱼常常被装饰在金银项圈里。",
	"Sahuagin are the only known race to have successfully trained sharks as mounts and the process is secret. What is known is that a shark and its rider can both attack the same enemy with startling agility, making the combination one of the most fearsome in the deeps. The harness used to mount a sahuagin warrior on the back of a shark is apparently made of a special kind of seaweed, unknown to those of the surface world.": "萨瓦金人是唯一已知的成功训练鲨鱼作为坐骑的种族，其过程是秘密的。众所周知的是，鲨鱼和它的骑手都能以惊人的敏捷性攻击同一个敌人，使这种组合成为深海中最可怕的东西之一。用来将萨瓦金战士骑在鲨鱼背上的马具显然是由一种特殊的海藻制成的，表面世界的人对此一无所知。",
	"Sharks have only two natural weaknesses. The first one is that their internal organs are only poorly protected by a thick, flexible layer of gristle instead of a hard skeleton. Some creatures, such as dolphins, take advantage of this by ramming sharks from the side. Because of their highly intelligent nature, dolphins are the only true enemies of sharks. They are the only known species that actively hunts down and kills these otherwise greatly feared and respected monsters.": "鲨鱼只有两个天然的弱点。第一个是它们的内部器官只有厚厚的、有弹性的肉质层，而不是坚硬的骨架，保护得很差。一些生物，如海豚，利用这一点，从侧面冲撞鲨鱼。由于海豚的高智商，它们是鲨鱼的唯一真正的敌人。它们是唯一的已知物种，主动猎杀这些本来非常令人恐惧和尊敬的怪物。",
	"Sharks are also forced to continuously move through the water in order to force sufficient volumes of oxygen-rich water past their primitive gills. Therefore, a shark that is held immobile for {@dice 1d4+1} hours will die of suffocation.": "鲨鱼也被迫在水中不断移动，以迫使足够数量的富氧水通过它们原始的鳃。因此，一条鲨鱼如果被关押了{@dice 1d4+1}小时不动，就会死于窒息。",

	"Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.": "每当九头蛇在一个回合中受到25或更多的伤害，它的一个头就会死亡。如果它所有的头都死了，九头蛇就会死亡。",
	"At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.": "在它的回合结束时，它每长出一个头就长出两个头，除非它在上一回合后受到了火焰伤害。九头蛇每重新长出一个头，就会恢复10点生命值。",
	"For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.": "九头蛇每超过一个头，就会得到一个额外的反应，只能用于机会攻击。",
