Its body is blue-green with gray splotches, and its pink-tan underbelly conceals a toothless, rubbery mouth. Three slit-like eyes, purple-red in color and protected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its head.

	"The aboleth spends most of its time searching for slaves, preferably human ones. It is rumored that the aboleth use their slaves to construct huge underwater cities, though none have ever been found. The aboleth are rumored to know ancient, horrible secrets that predate the existence of man, but these rumors are also unsubstantiated. There is no doubt that aboleth retain a staggering amount of knowledge. An offspring acquires all of its parent's knowledge at birth, and a mature aboleth acquires the knowledge of any intelligent being it consumes.": "aboleth大部分时间都在寻找奴隶，最好是人类的奴隶。有传言说，boleth用他们的奴隶来建造巨大的水下城市，尽管还没有发现。有传言说，阿波利特知道比人类存在更早的古老、可怕的秘密，但这些传言也是未经证实的。毫无疑问，Aboleth保留了数量惊人的知识。一个后代在出生时就获得了其父母的所有知识，而一个成熟的aboleth会获得它所消费的任何智能生物的知识。",

Aboleth slime is sometime used as a component for potions of water breathing.": "杂食性的Aboleth会吃任何有机物，通常是藻类和微生物，但它们也喜欢智能猎物，这样它们可以同时吸收营养和信息。Aboleth没有天敌，因为即使是最强大的海洋生物也会给它们一个宽阔的空间。Aboleth粘液有时被用作水呼吸药剂的成分。",

While fiends such as the glabrezu and succubi bring mortals to the Abyss, the alkiliths work to bring the Abyss itself to any world unfortunate enough to be within reach.

By spreading chaos and evil throughout the multiverse, they'll increase the power of the Abyss.": "在真正的Tanar'ri中，Alkiliths有一个不同寻常的目的：他们的存在是为了腐蚀他们所接触的一切，通过掠夺任何与之接触的东西来扩大深渊的范围。阿基里斯试图从身体和道德上污染深渊之外的世界。当格拉布瑞祖（glabrezu）和琥珀（succubi）等恶魔将凡人带到深渊时，白化石则致力于将深渊本身带到任何不幸的世界。炼金术士破坏美丽的事物，亵渎神圣的事物，并将恐惧或怨恨的余烬煽动成愤怒的仇恨。通过在整个多元宇宙中散布混乱和邪恶，他们会增加深渊的力量。",

	"These beings are native to Gehenna and tend to live in isolation on that plane. There, each barghest has its own stronghold and force of servitors, over which it rules despotically. Goblins readily recognize and worship barghests (even in their goblinoid form), but other races find them to be virtually indistinguishable from these common prime-material monsters. The goblin hosts fear and serve the barghests, often going to great lengths to bring them suitable gifts and sacrifices, and the barghests respond by slaying powerful enemies of the goblins as well as generally enriching the goblins' treasure hoards.": "这些生物原产于Gehenna，并倾向于在该平面上孤立地生活。在那里，每个barghest都有自己的据点和仆从部队，对其进行专制统治。地精很容易认出并崇拜巴格斯塔（即使是地精的形态），但其他种族发现它们与这些普通的原始物质怪物几乎没有什么区别。妖精的主人惧怕并服务于驳壳怪，经常不遗余力地给它们带来合适的礼物和祭品，而驳壳怪则通过杀死妖精的强大敌人以及普遍丰富妖精的宝藏来回应。",
	"Occasionally, a barghest on Gehenna will spawn a litter of six young, which are immediately sent to the Prime Material Plane to feed and grow.

	"When barghest whelps first come to the Prime Material, they are relatively weak, having only 6 Hit Dice. However, for every energy (experience) level of human (or demihuman) life that they slay or devour, 1 hit point is added to their overall total. Once they absorb eight levels, they gain another Hit Die. Note that 0-level characters are worth only one-half of an experience level to the barghest, so they are considerably less attractive targets than high-level heroes.

It may be that the bulette is hatched from very small eggs, with few young surviving to maturity. Still other sages theorize that the bulette bears live young. There is also evidence that the bulette, like carp and sharks, grow larger as they get older, for unusually large landsharks of 11 feet tall and taller have been seen. Certainly no one has ever come upon the carcass of a bulette that died of old age.": "对布莱特的生命周期知之甚少。它们可能是从蛋中孵化出来的，但从来没有发现过小鱼，尽管6个命中率的小陆鲨被杀死过。可能布莱特是从非常小的蛋中孵化出来的，很少有幼鱼能活到成熟期。还有一些圣人推测，布莱特会生下活的幼崽。也有证据表明，像鲤鱼和鲨鱼一样，布列特鱼随着年龄的增长而变大，因为人们已经看到了11英尺高或更高的异常大的陆鲨。当然，从来没有人遇到过因年老而死亡的布列特熊的尸体。",
	"The bulette has a devastating effect on the ecosystem of any area it inhabits. Literally nothing that moves is safe from it man, animal, or monster. In the process of hunting and roaming, the landshark will uproot trees of considerable size. In hilly and rocky regions, the underground movements of the bulette can start small landslides. Ogres, trolls, and even some giants all move off in search of greener and safer pastures when a bulette appears.": "布莱特对它所居住的任何地区的生态系统都有破坏性的影响。从字面上看，任何移动的东西都不会受到它的影响，无论是人、动物，还是怪物。在狩猎和漫游的过程中，陆鲨会将相当大的树木连根拔起。在丘陵和岩石地区，布莱特的地下运动可以引发小型山体滑坡。食人魔、巨魔，甚至一些巨人，在布莱特出现时都会离开，去寻找更绿、更安全的牧场。",
	"A bulette can turn a peaceful farming community into a wasteland in a few short weeks, for no sane human or demihuman will remain in a region where a bulette has been sighted.": "一个布莱特可以在短短几周内把一个和平的农业社区变成一片荒地，因为没有一个正常的人类或半人类会留在发现布莱特的地区。",
	"There is only one known benefit to the existence of the bulette: The large plates behind its head make superb shields, and dwarven smiths can fashion them into shields of +1 to +3 in value. Some also claim that the soil through which a bulette has passed becomes imbued with magical, rock-dissolving properties. Many would argue, however, that these benefits are scarcely worth the price.": "布莱特的存在只有一个已知的好处。它头部后面的大板块是极好的盾牌，矮人铁匠可以把它们做成价值+1至+3的盾牌。有些人还声称，布莱特经过的土壤会被赋予神奇的岩石溶解特性。然而，许多人认为，这些好处几乎不值得花钱。",

	"Bulezau tanar'ri are born and bred to fight in the Blood War. With the exception of the vrocks, bulezau are the toughest front-line troops of the tanar'ri hordes.

	"Bulezau can speak the common trade-jargon of the planes with difficulty or communicate with a weak form of telepathy at will. It's a good idea for a cutter to make out like he understands the bulezau perfectly no matter how animallike its speech is, since it's not a patient basher. If a bulezau decides it's easier to tear the arms off a sod than talk to him it won't wait long to act on its impulses.": "Bulezau可以艰难地说出各星球的通用贸易术语，或者随意地用一种弱的心灵感应形式进行交流。对于一个切割者来说，不管它的语言有多像动物，都要表现出他完全理解bulezau的样子，这是一个好主意，因为它不是一个有耐心的bossher。如果bulezau决定从一个草皮上撕下手臂比和他说话更容易，它不会等很久才采取行动的冲动。",
	"Bulezau are quarrelsome, bullying creature that often fall into lethal disagreements with each other. Only the authority of a powerful greater or true tanar'ri can keep them from each other's throats, and even then only if the promise of battle is near. Bulezau live for combat, and regard all other activities as a waste of time. They make poor pickets, sentries, or scouts since they've got no patience for waiting around or attempts at stealth if a bulezau sees an enemy, it charges, and if it doesn't see an enemy, it goes looking for one.": "Bulezau是一种争吵不休、恃强凌弱的生物，经常陷入彼此间的致命分歧。只有强大的大人物或真正的塔纳瑞人的权威才能使他们不互相残杀，即便如此，也只有在战斗的承诺临近时才会如此。Bulezau为战斗而活，认为所有其他活动都是浪费时间。他们是糟糕的纠察队、哨兵或侦察兵，因为他们没有耐心等待或尝试隐身，如果Bulezau看到敌人，它就会冲锋，如果它没有看到敌人，它就会去寻找。",
	"Bulezau may be difficult troops to keep control of, but they're very good at what they do. Once committed to a battle, they hold nothing back and plunge into the thick of the fight with reckless abandon.

	"It's rumored that the tanar'ri lord Baphomet, the patron demipower of minotaurs, was responsible for the creation of the bulezau.

It's also said that Baphomet maintains a bodyguard of fierce bulezau of unusual loyalty and discipline.": "有传言说，塔纳瑞人的领主巴弗灭，即牛头人的守护神，是创造布勒索的罪魁祸首。谣传说巴弗灭与他的牛头人仆人和一些为他服务的tanar'ri交配，但没有办法知道这是否是一种皮毛。还有人说，巴弗灭保持着一支由凶猛的bulezau组成的保镖，他们具有不同寻常的忠诚度和纪律性。",
	"Bulezau are generally well-regarded by tanar'ri of higher station, since bulezau pursue the Blood War with so much enthusiasm that a more subtle tanar'ri can drop out of sight when they're around. Tanar'ri commanders place a high value on bulezau formations and go out of their way to gather such units when possible. On the other hand, less powerful tanar'ri rarely want to be anywhere near a bulezau since the creature's likely to fly off into a murderous rage at the least provocation, regardless of the consequence. There've been engagements where more dretches and rutterkin were lost to bulezau impatience than to baatezu action.": "Bulezau通常受到地位较高的塔纳瑞人的重视，因为Bulezau以极大的热情追求血战，以至于当他们在附近时，一个更微妙的塔纳瑞人就会失去踪影。塔纳瑞人的指挥官高度重视布勒索人的编队，并在可能的情况下不遗余力地召集这些部队。另一方面，实力较弱的塔纳瑞人很少愿意靠近布勒索，因为这种生物很可能在受到最小的挑衅时就飞走，变成杀人狂魔，不计后果。在一些交战中，由于bulezau的急躁而失去的dretches和rutterkin比baatezu的行动更多。",

	"On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and powerlust seen in the individuals of other chaotic races, such as orcs. Fighting among members of the same group, for example, is almost nonexistent. Some would say that this is because they lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite.

Their faces are human-looking, although they have multi-faceted eyes and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Long stringy black hair falls in a tangle from their skulls and grows down their backs, like the mane of a horse.": "Chitines是拥有四条手臂的小型人形生物，用网状物建造，就像人类用石头或木头建造一样。这种矮小的人形生物种族最值得注意的是它的四条手臂，这些手臂是连接在一起的，可以以人类肢体无法移动的方式进行额外的运动。他们的脸看起来像人类，尽管他们有多面的眼睛和从嘴里伸出的下颚。长长的黑色绒毛从它们的头骨上纠结着落下，并顺着它们的背脊生长，就像马的鬃毛。",
	"The skin of the chitines is gray and mottled. A special oil is secreted that negates the adhesive effects of spider webbing. The palms of their hands and the soles of their feet are covered in dozens of tiny hooks, which allow them to climb textured surfaces with no loss of speed.": "甲壳虫的皮肤是灰色的，有斑点。分泌出一种特殊的油，可以否定蜘蛛网的粘合作用。它们的手掌和脚底覆盖着几十个小钩子，这使它们能够在不损失速度的情况下爬上有纹理的表面。",
	"Chitines wear clothing made from dried and processed silk. Bits of colored rocks, carved bones, and such are frequently woven throughout. They always keep their hands and feet uncovered. They carry their tools in pouches woven into their clothing. Chitines speak the language of the drow, and sometimes know a bit of other subterranean languages.": "Chitines穿的衣服是由干燥和加工过的丝绸制成的。彩色岩石、雕刻的骨头等碎片经常交织在一起。他们的手和脚总是露在外面。他们把工具放在编织在衣服上的袋子里。奇廷人讲乌鸦的语言，有时也懂一点其他地下语言。",
	"Chitines are only found underground. Their cavern villages are located in the center of a maze of trap-laden webbing. The hardened webbing dwellings resemble domed houses, complete with windows and decorative shapes adorning them. These homes can be located on any surface, including the ceiling. Bridges of webbing cross the town, providing easy pathways. Suspended in the center of the cavern is usually a heartshaped temple devoted to the evil goddess Lolth.": "Chitines只存在于地下。它们的洞穴村庄位于充满陷阱的网状物的迷宫中心。坚硬的网状物住宅类似于圆顶房屋，有完整的窗户和装饰性的形状装饰。这些房屋可以位于任何表面，包括天花板。网状物的桥梁横跨整个城镇，提供了方便的通道。悬挂在洞穴中心的通常是一个心形的庙宇，专门供奉邪恶的女神洛尔思。",

Stretched to its full length, an adult choker would stand nearly 6 feet tall.": "窒息者是一种在山洞和洞穴中发现的凶恶的小怪物。它有斑驳的灰色或石褐色肉体，看起来或多或少有点像人--有两只胳膊、两条腿、一个躯干和一个头。躯干和头就像人类婴儿一样小而紧凑，但手臂和腿（还有手指！）却令人难以置信地骨感和长。伸展到全长，一个成年人的吊环将站在近6英尺高的地方。",
	"This creature's limbs are like tentacles, having cartilage but no actual bones, with numerous knobby joints. The cartilage in its fingers juts out through the skin, and is stiff and razor-sharp. Because it lacks bones for support, the choker appears bowlegged and lopes with a strange, fluid gait. The creature is not completely boneless, however; it does have a bony skull, spine, and rib cage.": "这种生物的四肢就像触角，有软骨，但没有真正的骨头，有许多节状的关节。它手指上的软骨从皮肤里伸出来，坚硬而锋利。由于缺乏骨骼的支撑，吊颈鹿看起来像罗圈腿，并以一种奇怪的、流畅的步态奔跑着。然而，这种生物并非完全无骨；它确实有一个骨质的头骨、脊柱和肋骨。",
	"Chokers are vaguely intelligent and speak a primitive language.": "窒息者有隐约的智慧，讲一种原始的语言。",

	"Because chokers are inherently shy, they would have difficulty locating mates were it not for their special call. To attract a partner, both males and females keen. This whine (which humans and others find extremely irritating) echoes through the deep caverns the chokers call home. When a choker hears the keen of a potential mate, it answers. Then each creature keens in turn to draw the other near, until at last they meet. A few months later, the female gives birth to two to six young. The family stays together for three years, until the offspring have fully matured. Once the offspring have moved on, the parents separate and seek new mates.": "由于窒息鸟天生害羞，如果不是它们的特殊叫声，它们将很难找到配偶。为了吸引伴侣，雄性和雌性都会发出尖锐的声音。这种呜叫声（人类和其他人都觉得非常刺激）在窒息者称之为家的深洞中回荡。当窒息者听到潜在伴侣的尖声时，它就会回答。然后每个生物轮流鸣叫，以吸引对方靠近，直到最后它们相遇。几个月后，雌鸟生下两到六只小鸟。这个家庭在一起呆了三年，直到后代完全成熟。一旦孩子们长大了，父母就会分开，寻找新的伴侣。",
	"The choker has a high metabolism. It burns an enormous number of calories, especially for a creature of its light weight. Consequently it is always on the lookout for victims on which to feed, and it consumes them rapidly. (A goblin provides about two days' food, for example.)": "小丑有很高的新陈代谢率。它燃烧了大量的卡路里，特别是对于它这种轻量级的生物来说。因此，它总是在寻找可以进食的受害者，并迅速消耗他们。(例如，一个地精可以提供大约两天的食物）。",

	"A legend among goblins says that chokers descended from a goblin band which, beset by hardship, turned to cannibalism. Youngsters in this tribe devoured their elders. Over time, the band degenerated. With the twisting of their minds came a reshaping of their bodies; their arms grew long and their fingers steely, enabling them to better grab and strangle prey. They no longer fed upon each other, but continued to crave the flesh of normal goblins.": "妖精中的一个传说说，窒息者是一个妖精部落的后裔，他们受困于困难，转而吃人。这个部落的年轻人吞噬了他们的长辈。随着时间的推移，这支队伍堕落了。随着他们思想的扭曲，他们的身体也被重塑；他们的手臂变长，手指变得坚硬，使他们能够更好地抓住和扼杀猎物。他们不再以彼此为食，而是继续渴望正常地精的肉体。",
	"As mentioned earlier, chokers can be driven off if their would-be victims prove an able match in combat. In areas infested with chokers, goblins and dwarves also take advantage of the chokers' caution by making a lot of noise, pounding weapons on shields and the like, to scare the chokers away. This tactic sometimes backfires, however, as the noise tends to attract other, more dangerous monsters.": "如前所述，如果他们的潜在受害者在战斗中被证明是一个能干的对手，那么窒息者可以被赶走。在窒息者出没的地区，地精和矮人也会利用窒息者的谨慎，制造大量的噪音，用武器敲击盾牌等等，来吓走窒息者。然而，这种策略有时会适得其反，因为这种噪音往往会吸引其他更危险的怪物。",

Once the demilich has acquired 50 energy points, it will assume a manifestation which looks much like the lich's earlier undead form and has the powers and abilities of a ghost, but which cannot be turned.": "如果进入Demilich遗体的最终安息地，曾经是其身体的灰尘会升起，并呈现出类似人的形状。如果是最年长的demiliches（25%），这个形状会前进和威胁，但除非受到攻击，否则会在3个回合内消散而不进行攻击。然而，较年轻的demiliches（75%）仍然保留着与他们的遗体的联系，并将形成一个包裹的力量。这种尘埃形态不能被转化。此外，它可以从攻击中储存能量，并使用这种力量来对付它的敌人。如果尘埃形态受到攻击，它受到的每一点伤害都会转化为一个能量点。由于demilich会后退，并似乎在每次攻击中受到伤害（虽然实际上没有造成伤害），它的攻击者可能会继续试图摧毁它。一旦demilich获得了50个能量点，它就会呈现出一种表现形式，看起来很像Lich早期的不死形态，具有幽灵的力量和能力，但不能被转化。",
	"If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to face the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen over a non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as a death ray, affecting all creatures within a 20' radius of the skull. Those who fail to save vs. death are permanently dead.": "如果有人触碰头骨，它就会升到空中，转身面对最强大的入侵者（会选择施法者而不是非施法者）。瞬间，它发出一声嚎叫，作为死亡射线，影响骷髅头周围20英尺范围内的所有生物。那些无法对死亡进行拯救的人将永久死亡。",
	"On the next round, the demilich will employ another manner of attack. In order to attain the status of a demilich, a lich must have replaced 5-8 (1d4+4) of its teeth with gems. Each of these gems now serves as a powerful magical device which can trap the soul of its adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the demilich's spell collapses and rots away in a single round. Once it has drained the life essence from the most powerful member of the party, the skull sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be challenged, the demilich can repeat this attack until all of its gems are filled. An amulet of life protection will prevail over the gem, but the character's body will perish regardless.": "在下一回合，恶魔将采用另一种方式进行攻击。为了达到半身人的地位，半身人必须将其5-8颗（1d4+4）牙齿换成宝石。每颗宝石现在都是一个强大的魔法装置，可以困住对手的灵魂。被demilich的法术击中的人的身体会在一个回合内崩溃并腐烂。一旦它吸干了党内最强大成员的生命精华，头骨就会沉入地面。如果它继续受到挑战，demilich可以重复这种攻击，直到它所有的宝石被填满。生命保护的护身符将胜过宝石，但无论如何，角色的身体都会灭亡。",
	"In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be so mighty as to include: always being hit by one's enemies, never making a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience points. Demilich curses can be overcome with a remove curse, but the victim loses one point of charisma permanently when the curse is removed.": "除了上面提到的攻击，demilich还可以对那些打扰它的人宣布一个强大的诅咒。这些诅咒可以非常强大，包括：总是被敌人击中，永远无法进行救赎，或者无法获得新的经验值。妖怪的诅咒可以通过移除诅咒来克服，但是当诅咒被移除时，受害者会永久地失去一点魅力值。",
	"The skull of a demilich can be affected by spells in only a few ways: a forget spell will cause it to sink down without attacking (either by howling or draining a soul), a dispel evil will do 5-8 (1d4+4) points of damage to it, a shatter spell will inflict 3-18 (3d6) points of damage to it, a holy word pronounced against it will deliver 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and a power word kill spell cast by an ethereal or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it).": "恶魔的头骨只有几种方式可以受到法术的影响。一个遗忘咒语会使它在没有攻击的情况下沉下去（通过嚎叫或抽走灵魂），一个驱散邪恶的咒语会对它造成5-8（1d4+4）点伤害，一个粉碎咒语会对它造成3-18（3d6）点伤害，一个对它宣读的圣言会带来5-30（5d6）点伤害，而一个由空灵或星空巫师施展的力量词杀咒会使头骨粉碎（摧毁它）。",
	"Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich, but there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a vorpal sword, sword of sharpness, sword +5, or vorpal weapon can inflict normal damage on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4 weapon. Further, any character with a +4 or better weapon or a mace of disruption can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each time he strikes it.": "大多数武器都无法伤害恶魔的头骨，但也有例外。拥有斩首剑、锋利之剑、+5剑或斩首武器的战士或游侠可以对头骨造成正常的伤害，拥有斩首武器或+4武器的圣骑士也是如此。此外，任何拥有+4或更好的武器或破坏之矛的角色，每次攻击头骨时都可以对其造成1点伤害。",
	"Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped inside the gems must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich to power its magical nature. If the character survives, the gem glows with a faint inner light, and true seeing will reveal a tiny figure trapped within. If the throw is made the soul can be freed by simply crushing the gem. A new body must be within 10 yards for the soul to enter or it will be lost. Such a body might be a clone or simulacrum. (See spells of those names.)": "骷髅头被摧毁后，那些被困在宝石里的人必须对咒语做一个拯救动作。那些失败的人将永远消失，因为他们已经被demilich所吞噬，以增强其魔法性质。如果角色幸存下来，宝石就会发出微弱的内在光芒，真正的观察会发现一个被困在里面的小人物。如果投掷成功，灵魂可以通过简单地粉碎宝石而被释放出来。一个新的身体必须在10码之内，以便灵魂进入，否则它就会丢失。这样的身体可能是一个克隆体或模拟体。(参见这些名字的咒语）。",
	"If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by immersion in holy water and the casting of a dispel magic the demilich will reform in 1-10 days.": "如果被毁坏的头骨碎片没有被浸泡在圣水中并施放驱散魔法，那么恶魔将在1-10天内重新形成。",
	"The derro has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "德罗人对法术和其他魔法效果的救赎有优势。",
	"While in sunlight, the derro has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.": "在阳光下时，德鲁在攻击卷轴以及依靠视觉的智慧（感知）检查上都处于劣势。",
	"{@atk mw} {@hit 2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage, or 4 ({@damage 1d8}) piercing damage if used with both hands. If the target is Medium or smaller, the derro can choose to deal no damage and knock it {@condition prone}.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 2}击中，到达5英尺，一个目标。{@h}3 ({@damage 1d6})穿刺伤害，如果双手使用，则为4 ({@damage 1d8})穿刺伤害。如果目标是中等或更小，德鲁可以选择不造成伤害并将其击倒（%5%）。",

	"Derro are a degenerate race of dwarven stature. They have dwelled in the Underdark for ages, but they were discovered by the mind flayers only five centuries ago, and by the drow but shortly before that. The derro have made a name for themselves by their marked cruelty. It is said that a derro lives for two things: the slow and humiliating death of surface demihumans and especially humans, and the perversion of knowledge for their own dark ends.": "德罗是一个矮人身材的退化种族。他们在暗黑世界居住了很久，但他们是在五个世纪前才被思想传播者发现的，而在那之前不久被乌鸦发现。德罗人因其明显的残忍而声名鹊起。据说，德鲁人只为两件事而活：缓慢而屈辱地杀死地表半人，尤其是人类，以及为自己的黑暗目的颠覆知识。",
	"Derro are short, with skin the color of an ice-covered lake (white, with bluish undertones), sickly pale yellow or tan hair (always straight), and staring, pupil-less eyes. Their features remind dwarves of humans, and vice versa. Derro have rough skin, spotted with short coarse tufts of hair. Most derro wear a loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and dyed in deep reds and browns. Even in full armor, exploring new territory or patrolling their own, derro are easily recognizable. Their armor is leather, studded in copper and brass. Leaders, though, wear tougher leather armors, made from the hides of creatures far tougher than cattle. Derro prefer weapons designed to cripple opponents, rather than those built for a quick kill: derro don't see any sport in spears and axes.": "德罗人身材矮小，皮肤的颜色如同冰封的湖面（白色，带有蓝色的底色），病态的淡黄色或棕褐色的头发（总是直的），以及瞪着的、没有瞳孔的眼睛。他们的特征让矮人想起了人类，反之亦然。德鲁人的皮肤粗糙，有短而粗的毛发斑点。大多数德鲁人穿着由地下生物的毛发织成的宽松服装，并染成深红色和棕色。即使穿着全副武装，在探索新的领土或巡逻自己的领土时，德鲁人也很容易被识别。他们的盔甲是皮革的，上面镶有铜和黄铜。不过，领袖们穿的是更坚硬的皮甲，由远比牛更坚硬的生物的皮制成。德鲁人更喜欢旨在削弱对手的武器，而不是那些为快速杀戮而制造的武器：德鲁人不认为长矛和斧头有任何运动。",
	"Derro dwell in large underground complexes, nearer the surface than the kuo-toa and drow, but deeper than goblins and trolls. They never expose themselves to direct sunlight, as it nauseates them. Sunlight would kill a derro were he to be exposed to it for a few days. Yet derro occasionally visit the surface world at night, raiding for humans or carrying out a savant's plans.": "德罗居住在大型地下建筑群中，比国土和乌鸦更接近地表，但比地精和巨魔更深。他们从不将自己暴露在阳光下，因为阳光让他们感到恶心。阳光会杀死一个德鲁人，如果他暴露在阳光下数天。然而，德鲁人偶尔会在夜间造访地表世界，袭击人类或执行救世主的计划。",
	"Derro are never encountered singly. From their combat tactics to their choice of spells, derro demonstrate a mob mentality. A lone demo (the last survivor of an ill-fated patrol, perhaps) is a desperate derro, seeking at all costs to return to his home lair.": "德鲁人从来不是单独遇到的。从他们的战斗策略到他们对法术的选择，德鲁表现出一种暴民心态。一个孤独的演示者（也许是一支命运多舛的巡逻队的最后幸存者）是一个绝望的德鲁，不惜一切代价寻求回到他的老巢。",
	"A derro lair always has 3d4 + 30 normal derro, plus leaders. The members of the lair are led by the resident savants (1d3 in number) and their apprentices (1d4+1 student savants). Derro unquestioningly obey the puzzling, even suicidal, dictates from their savant leaders.": "一个德鲁的巢穴总是有3d4+30个正常的德鲁，加上领导者。巢穴中的成员由驻扎在巢穴中的救世主（数量为1d3）和他们的学徒（1d4+1名救世主学生）领导。德罗毫无疑义地服从他们的救世主领导的令人费解的，甚至是自杀性的指令。",
	"Should a lair grow very much over 40 inhabitants, half the group (with half the savants and half the leaders) will split off and form an independent community. Such a splinter group will travel quite a distance before settling down, as no two derro lairs have been spotted within several miles of each other. The two groups may communicate for a short time, in order to ensure the new lair's safety, but they soon sever all contacts and act utterly independently of one another. Although it is possible for two lairs to be at war with one another, or to join in combat against a common enemy, no examples of these behaviors have ever been recorded, with the exception of the regular Uniting War, described below.": "如果一个巢穴的居民人数远远超过40人，那么一半的群体（包括一半的知识分子和一半的领导者）将分裂出来，形成一个独立的社区。这样一个分裂的群体在定居之前会走一段距离，因为在几英里范围内没有发现两个德鲁人的巢穴。为了确保新巢穴的安全，这两个群体可能会进行短暂的沟通，但他们很快就会切断所有的联系，完全独立于对方。虽然两个巢穴之间有可能发生战争，或者联合起来对付一个共同的敌人，但除了下面描述的定期联合战争外，还没有记录过这些行为的例子。",
	"Also to be found in a derro lair are 5d6+10 human slaves. If any of the lair's savants or students know the {@spell charm person} spell, each slave has a 90% chance of being charmed. Derro hate humans more than any other race; they use humans for the most demeaning manual labor and for breeding.": "在德鲁的巢穴中还可以找到5d6+10个人类奴隶。如果巢穴中的任何一个专家或学生知道{@spell charm person}的咒语，每个奴隶都有90%的机会被魅惑。德罗人比其他任何种族都更讨厌人类；他们利用人类从事最卑微的体力劳动和繁衍后代。",
	"The derro are said to have a major stronghold somewhere in the Underdark, and there the savants plot and scheme to devastate the surface world and enslave all humanity.": "据说德鲁人在暗黑世界的某个地方有一个主要的据点，在那里，野蛮人阴谋诡计，要破坏地面世界，奴役所有人类。",
	"Derro do not appear to worship any powers, but the savants treasure knowledge and the rest of the race pretty much worships the savants. The worst criminals in the derro community, subject to the Polite Execution (which takes a good two weeks, and which roams over miles of subterranean territory), are those who do not follow the laws of the savants.": "德罗人似乎并不崇拜任何力量，但救世主们珍惜知识，其他种族的人几乎都崇拜救世主。德罗人社区中最严重的罪犯是那些不遵守救世主法律的人，他们要接受礼貌处决（需要两个星期的时间，而且会在数英里的地下领土上游荡）。",
	"Most of those laws have to do with the derros' goals: the destruction of humanity and the acquisition of arcane and obscure information. Derro usually scour their territory for magical items, stealing them or, if necessary, purchasing them from more powerful creatures. Derro do not share the love of gold common to their dwarfish relatives, and they have been known to pay exorbitant prices for a few potions or for a magical item with a missing command word.": "这些法律大多与德鲁人的目标有关：毁灭人类和获取神秘和晦涩的信息。德罗人通常会在自己的领地内搜寻魔法物品，偷窃它们，或者在必要时从更强大的生物那里购买。德罗人并不像他们的矮人亲戚那样喜欢黄金，他们也曾为一些药水或缺少指令词的魔法物品支付过高昂的价格。",
	"This serves as one of the bases of trade between derro and other races of the Underdark. Drow find derro to be dangerous opponents (due to the latter's magic resistance) and a race of barbarians with too much interest in the surface world. The mind flayers think the derro taste bad. Duergar disapprove of the derro's love of cruelty. And derro really don't much care about the other races deep beneath the surface. But derro often raid the surface and acquire technology or items that other deep races desire, and so limited trade between a lair and some surrounding creatures is possible.": "这也是德鲁人与暗黑世界其他种族之间的贸易基地之一。鸦人认为德鲁是危险的对手（由于后者的魔法抗性），也是对表面世界有太多兴趣的野蛮人种族。噬心者认为德罗的味道不好。杜尔加人不赞成德鲁人对残忍的热爱。而且德鲁人真的不怎么关心地表下的其他种族。但德鲁经常突袭地表，获得其他深层种族渴望的技术或物品，因此巢穴与周围一些生物之间的有限贸易是可能的。",
	"Every 20 years or so, the derro race mounts an all-out war against other creatures of the Underdark. This is known as the Uniting War, and no savant really expects to win it. The War is a means of winnowing out the weakest of the derro lairs, a focal point for racial identity, and a chance to really start some terror throughout the Underdark. It also serves the purpose of starting rumors. That is, humans will certainly hear that a war is being fought in the Underdark, and will send hundreds of scouting and adventuring parties into the deep underground to investigate. The derro welcome this new source of slaves.": "每隔20年左右，德鲁族就会对暗黑世界的其他生物发动一场全面的战争。这场战争被称为 \"联合战争\"，没有人真正期望赢得这场战争。这场战争是筛选出最弱小的德鲁人巢穴的一种手段，是种族认同的一个焦点，也是一个在整个暗黑世界真正掀起一些恐怖的机会。它还能起到制造谣言的目的。也就是说，人类肯定会听说地下城正在进行一场战争，并会派出数以百计的侦察队和冒险队进入地下深处进行调查。德罗人欢迎这种新的奴隶来源。",
	"Derro can live on a diet of underground fungi, but they find the stuff to be foul-tasting if used as anything other than spices. Thus they seek out other sustenance whenever possible. A derro hunting party usually pursues large, dangerous prey that can feed the entire lair, rather than smaller, simpler food. The derro tendency to torment prey holds true with hunting for food.": "德罗可以以地下真菌为食，但他们发现这种东西如果作为香料以外的东西，味道很难闻。因此，只要有可能，他们就会寻找其他的养料。德鲁的狩猎队通常追捕可以养活整个巢穴的大型、危险的猎物，而不是小型、简单的食物。德鲁人折磨猎物的倾向在猎取食物时也是如此。",
	"The derro also raid other races for food. Sometimes, they merely rob the dwarves or the orcs, hoping to provoke an amusing conflict. But such excursions are tame compared to Open Hunting, the derro term for midnight raids into human settlements. When Open Hunting, a derro party steals cattle and swine, to let loose and hunt at a later time, but it primarily kidnaps humans. As mentioned before, derro treasure humans for slaves and for breeding.": "德鲁人也会袭击其他种族以获取食物。有时，他们只是抢劫矮人或兽人，希望能挑起一场有趣的冲突。但与 \"公开狩猎 \"相比，这样的远行是温顺的，\"公开狩猎 \"是德鲁人对午夜突袭人类居住区的称呼。在公开狩猎时，德鲁人的队伍会偷牛和猪，以便在以后的时间里放出来狩猎，但它主要是绑架人类。如前所述，德鲁人珍视人类，将其作为奴隶和繁衍后代之用。",
	"Derro have few other roles in the underground ecosystem. In the last few Uniting Wars, the drow noticed that derro blood (a milky substance that turns brown and rotten upon the slightest exposure to bright light) was a useful ingredient in drow potions.": "德罗在地下生态系统中几乎没有其他作用。在过去的几次联合战争中，鸦人注意到德鲁人的血（一种乳白色的物质，稍微暴露在强光下就会变成棕色并腐烂）是鸦人药水的有用成分。",

	"When a dragon turtle surfaces, it is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the water. The turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell are patterned like light dancing on open water.": "当龙龟浮出水面时，有时会被误认为是太阳或月亮在水中的反射。龙龟粗糙的深绿色外壳的颜色与龙龟喜欢的深水区的颜色相同，外壳上的银色亮点的图案就像在开放的水面上跳舞的光。",

	"Dragon turtles are carnivorous and will eat almost any creature, including humans or other dragon turtles, to satisfy their voracious appetite. Large fish seem to be the prefered food for dragon turtles, and the turtles can often be found lurking in the weeds and muck at the bottom of a lake or sea waiting for fish to pass. In particularly poor years for fish, dragon turtles have been known to use their breath weapon to kill large groups of sea birds that stray too close to the water for food.": "龙龟是肉食性动物，几乎会吃任何生物，包括人类或其他龙龟，以满足它们贪婪的胃口。大鱼似乎是龙龟的首选食物，经常可以发现龙龟潜伏在湖底或海底的杂草和淤泥中，等待鱼群经过。在鱼类特别少的年份，龙龟曾用它们的呼吸武器杀死大群离水面太近的海鸟，以获取食物。",

Like many of their land-based relatives, dragon turtles are considered treacherous and selfish by all creatures that share their domain.": "由于对理想巢穴的竞争，龙龟和许多聪明的水生种族之间经常会发生冲突，比如locathah或mermen。就像它们在陆地上的许多亲戚一样，龙龟被所有分享它们领域的生物认为是奸诈和自私的。",

	"Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep cave bears in the area of their lairs.

Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs for valuables will find the task disgusting, if not dangerous.": "据了解，埃廷斯也偶尔会在其巢穴的区域内饲养洞熊。埃廷人的松散洞穴是寄生虫和害虫的天堂，埃廷人自己感染各种寄生虫疾病也是很正常的。冒险者在埃廷人的巢穴中翻找贵重物品时，会发现这项任务很恶心，甚至很危险。",
	"Because ettin society is so primitive, they produce little of any value to civilized creatures.

Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently isolationist, crushing trespassers without question.": "由于Ettin社会是如此的原始，他们对文明的生物几乎没有任何价值。埃廷人容忍其他生物的存在，比如兽人，在他们的巢穴区域，如果他们能以某种方式发挥作用。否则，埃廷人倾向于采取暴力隔离主义，不问青红皂白地粉碎闯入者。",

Gargoyles do not need to eat or drink, so they can stand motionless for as long as they wish almost anywhere.": "后来，一些不知名的法师用一种强大的魔法使这些可怕的雕塑活了过来。石像鬼这个种族蓬勃发展，在全世界范围内传播。石像鬼不需要吃喝，所以它们几乎可以在任何地方一动不动地站着，只要它们愿意。",
	"The damage they do to other creatures is not for sustenance, but only for their distorted sense of pleasure. Because they are fairly intelligent and evil, they will sometimes serve an evil master of some sort. In this case, the gargoyles usually act as guards or messengers; besides some gold or a few gems. their unsavory payment is the enjoyment they get from attacking unwanted visitors.": "他们对其他生物的伤害不是为了维持生计，而只是为了他们扭曲的快乐感。由于它们相当聪明和邪恶，它们有时会为某种邪恶的主人服务。在这种情况下，石像鬼通常充当守卫或信使；除了一些黄金或几颗宝石外，他们不光彩的报酬是他们从攻击不受欢迎的访客中得到的乐趣。",

Permanent objects, such as magical swords, are rendered powerless for one round by this ability. Artifacts are not affected by the dweomer drain.

	"History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).": "历史提供了一些关于Githyanki的信息，他们的种族既古老又隐秘。圣人认为他们曾经是人类，被心灵传播者抓去当奴隶和牲畜。思想传播者残酷地对待他们的人类奴隶，人们对他们怀有深深的怨恨。几个世纪以来，这些人类增加了他们的仇恨，但却无法召唤出必要的力量来挣脱。所以他们等待了很多年，秘密地发展他们的力量，等待一个机会来打击他们的主人。最后，在他们中间出现了一个有能力的女人，一个名叫吉斯的救世主。她说服人们起来反对他们残忍的主人。斗争是漫长而恶毒的，但最终人民解放了自己。他们赢得了自由，并成为吉特扬基人（在他们的语言中，意思是吉思的儿子）。",
	"These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.": "这些星体的发展水平与人类完全一样。然而，从来没有一个githyanki的经验水平超过11级，很少有超过9级的。当一个githyanki晋级到第9级时，他要接受lich-queen的测试。这个艰苦的测试包括在一个较低的平面中生存数周。失败的结果很明显是死亡。经验达到12级的Githyanki会立即被拉出星界，并被拉到Lich-queen的面前，他们的生命力会被拉到那里，以满足这个残酷的半女神的饥渴感。",

	"Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane.

	"An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond between military leaders and their subordinates. This bond allows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands (to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly.": "githyanki社会的一个有趣方面是军事领导人和他们的下属之间的明显联系。这种纽带使领导者能够给他的部下下达简短的、几乎毫无意义的命令（以人类的标准），并实际转达复杂而严格的信息。虽然这在近战回合中没有实际影响，但它往往会导致更有效的伏击和攻击，并使复杂的军事决策得以迅速转达。",
	"Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different.

This large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai living in great power. Shra'kt'lor serves as both a capital and as a headquarters for all githzerai military matters.

	"One of the prime motivations among the githzerai is their war with the githyanki. These offshoots of Gith's original race are obsessed with this war of extermination. They often employ mercenaries on the Prime Material plane to aid them in battling the githyanki. The evil, destructive nature of the githyanki makes the hiring of mercenaries to fight them a relatively simple task.": "吉斯泽拉人的主要动机之一是他们与吉特汉克人的战争。这些吉斯原始种族的分支沉迷于这场灭绝性的战争。他们经常雇用主物质位面的雇佣兵来帮助他们与吉特汉克作战。Githyanki的邪恶和破坏性使得雇佣雇佣兵与他们作战成为一项相对简单的任务。",
	"Legend of the Zerthimon: In githzerai lore there is a central figure that is revered above all others Zerthimon. The githyanki believe him to be a great god that was once a man.

It might be said that the zerths are the center of githzerai religion. Unfortunately, they are not free from religious persecution.": "Zerths在githzerai中很特别，它是Zerthimon关注的焦点。githzerai相信，当Zerthimon为他们返回时，他将首先召集所有的Zerths，并带领他们到他们的新天堂。可以说，Zerths是githzerai宗教的中心。不幸的是，他们并没有摆脱宗教迫害。",
	"The wizard-king (whose name is not known) that rules over the highly superstitious githzerai would like very much to stamp out the legend of Zerthimon. The wizard-king believes that this legend challenges his authority, and very likely it does. However, he has never been able to rid the githzerai of this legend and he is now forced to tolerate it.": "统治高度迷信的githzerai的巫师国王（名字不详）非常希望能消除Zerthimon的传说。巫师王认为这个传说挑战了他的权威，而且很可能是这样。然而，他始终无法使githzerai摆脱这个传说，他现在不得不容忍它。",
	"Rrakkma bands: Although the githzerai are not a bitter or overly violent race, they still tend to hold a strong enmity and hatred for the race of illithids that originally enslaved the gith race so many thousands of years ago. By human terms, that may be a very long time to hold a grudge, but the githzerai see the mind flayers as the cause of the split of the Gith race and much of the hardships the githzerai are forced to endure. Thus large rrakkma (in the githzerai tongue) bands are often formed to hunt mind flayers. These bands typically consist of 1d4+2 x 10 githzerai warriors led by the githzerai equivalent of a sergeant. For roughly three months, these bands will roam the outer and inner planes, searching for groups of illithids and destroying them utterly. The rrakkma bands are very popular in githzerai society and it is considered to be an honor to serve in one.": "拉克马乐队。虽然吉斯泽拉人不是一个痛苦或过度暴力的种族，但他们仍然倾向于对几千年前奴役吉斯族的伊利斯人种族持有强烈的敌意和仇恨。从人类的角度来看，这可能是一段非常长的记恨时间，但吉斯泽拉人认为，心灵传播者是吉斯族分裂的原因，也是吉斯泽拉人被迫忍受的大部分苦难。因此，大型的rrakkma（吉斯泽拉语）队伍经常被组建起来，以猎杀心灵传播者。这些队伍通常由1d4+2 x 10名吉塞莱战士组成，由相当于吉塞莱中士的人领导。在大约三个月的时间里，这些队伍会在外部和内部星球上漫游，寻找幻术师群体并彻底摧毁他们。rrakkma乐队在吉塞拉社会中非常受欢迎，能在其中服务被认为是一种荣誉。",
	"The githzerai fortresses on the Prime Material plane tend to be very large affairs with great, impenetrable walls. Wherever these fortresses stand, they destroy the landscape for miles. No plants or animals live within many miles of the fortresses and the land is reduced to wasteland around them.

	"The most likely purpose of these fortresses on the Prime Material plane is to keep tabs on the githyanki. The githzerai, not being a particularly war-mongering or violent race, have no desire to conquer the Prime Material plane like the githyanki do. However, the githzerai realize that if their enemies have a strong hold on the Prime Material plane, they will become more powerful and thus will hold power over them. The githzerai carefully monitor the progress on the githyanki and lead coordinated, focused strikes against strongpoints of the githyanki, thus hampering their ability to expand and grow in the Prime Material plane.": "在主物质位面的这些堡垒最可能的目的是为了监视githyanki的情况。githzerai并不是一个特别好战或暴力的种族，他们并不像githyanki那样想要征服主物质界。然而，githzerai意识到，如果他们的敌人在主物质界有强大的控制力，他们就会变得更加强大，从而对他们拥有权力。githzerai仔细监测githyanki的进展，并领导协调、集中的打击githyanki的强点，从而阻碍他们在主物质界扩张和发展的能力。",

	"Like the githyanki, the githzerai really have no part in the Blood War of the fiends. They seldom venture to the lower planes, and only then for matters of absolute importance. The githzerai find the bloodthirsty, destructive nature of the fiends to be distasteful, so they will typically not deal with those creatures for any reason. They coexist with the slaadi, and githzerai are rumored to have mental powers beyond those described here.": "就像吉蒂亚克人一样，吉斯泽拉人真的没有参与魔族的血战。他们很少冒险去低层世界，只有在绝对重要的情况下才去。githzerai认为魔族的嗜血和破坏性是令人讨厌的，所以他们通常不会以任何理由与这些生物打交道。他们与slaadi共存，据传githzerai有超出这里描述的精神力量。",
	"For as long as men have known of the ability to travel the planes, they have wondered at the natural power of the githzerai to wander from plane to plane at will. Although man and githzerai are not natural enemies, battles are frequently fought between the two races, due in part to some humans' desire to capture a live githzerai for study. To date, no such creature has been secured.": "自从人类知道有能力在各个星球上旅行以来，他们就对githzerai随心所欲地在各个星球间游荡的自然能力感到好奇。虽然人类和githzerai不是天生的敌人，但这两个种族之间经常发生战斗，部分原因是由于一些人类希望捕获一个活的githzerai来研究。到目前为止，还没有获得这样的生物。",

	"Goristroi ruled by an Abyssal lord or power always wear some symbol of servitude, such as a collar, an arm or wrist band, or an implanted symbol.

	"They are exclusively carnivorous, unable to eat vegetable matter even if no other food is available. If forced to go without living or recently slain meat, goristroi wither and die within two weeks, so tanar'ri commanders usually sacrifice lesser troops for the sake of keeping their citadels going.": "它们完全是肉食性的，即使没有其他食物，也不能吃蔬菜。如果被迫不吃活肉或最近被杀的肉，戈里斯特罗伊会在两周内枯萎和死亡，所以塔纳瑞人的指挥官通常会牺牲较小的部队来维持他们的城堡。",
