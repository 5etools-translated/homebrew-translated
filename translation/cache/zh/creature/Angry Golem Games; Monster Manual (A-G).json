Its body is blue-green with gray splotches, and its pink-tan underbelly conceals a toothless, rubbery mouth. Three slit-like eyes, purple-red in color and protected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its head.

	"The aboleth spends most of its time searching for slaves, preferably human ones. It is rumored that the aboleth use their slaves to construct huge underwater cities, though none have ever been found. The aboleth are rumored to know ancient, horrible secrets that predate the existence of man, but these rumors are also unsubstantiated. There is no doubt that aboleth retain a staggering amount of knowledge. An offspring acquires all of its parent's knowledge at birth, and a mature aboleth acquires the knowledge of any intelligent being it consumes.": "aboleth大部分时间都在寻找奴隶，最好是人类的奴隶。有传言说，boleth用他们的奴隶来建造巨大的水下城市，尽管还没有发现。有传言说，阿波利特知道比人类存在更早的古老、可怕的秘密，但这些传言也是未经证实的。毫无疑问，Aboleth保留了数量惊人的知识。一个后代在出生时就获得了其父母的所有知识，而一个成熟的aboleth会获得它所消费的任何智能生物的知识。",

Aboleth slime is sometime used as a component for potions of water breathing.": "杂食性的Aboleth会吃任何有机物，通常是藻类和微生物，但它们也喜欢智能猎物，这样它们可以同时吸收营养和信息。Aboleth没有天敌，因为即使是最强大的海洋生物也会给它们一个宽阔的空间。Aboleth粘液有时被用作水呼吸药剂的成分。",

While fiends such as the glabrezu and succubi bring mortals to the Abyss, the alkiliths work to bring the Abyss itself to any world unfortunate enough to be within reach.

By spreading chaos and evil throughout the multiverse, they'll increase the power of the Abyss.": "在真正的Tanar'ri中，Alkiliths有一个不同寻常的目的：他们的存在是为了腐蚀他们所接触的一切，通过掠夺任何与之接触的东西来扩大深渊的范围。阿基里斯试图从身体和道德上污染深渊之外的世界。当格拉布瑞祖（glabrezu）和琥珀（succubi）等恶魔将凡人带到深渊时，白化石则致力于将深渊本身带到任何不幸的世界。炼金术士破坏美丽的事物，亵渎神圣的事物，并将恐惧或怨恨的余烬煽动成愤怒的仇恨。通过在整个多元宇宙中散布混乱和邪恶，他们会增加深渊的力量。",

	"These beings are native to Gehenna and tend to live in isolation on that plane. There, each barghest has its own stronghold and force of servitors, over which it rules despotically. Goblins readily recognize and worship barghests (even in their goblinoid form), but other races find them to be virtually indistinguishable from these common prime-material monsters. The goblin hosts fear and serve the barghests, often going to great lengths to bring them suitable gifts and sacrifices, and the barghests respond by slaying powerful enemies of the goblins as well as generally enriching the goblins' treasure hoards.": "这些生物原产于Gehenna，并倾向于在该平面上孤立地生活。在那里，每个barghest都有自己的据点和仆从部队，对其进行专制统治。地精很容易认出并崇拜巴格斯塔（即使是地精的形态），但其他种族发现它们与这些普通的原始物质怪物几乎没有什么区别。妖精的主人惧怕并服务于驳壳怪，经常不遗余力地给它们带来合适的礼物和祭品，而驳壳怪则通过杀死妖精的强大敌人以及普遍丰富妖精的宝藏来回应。",
	"Occasionally, a barghest on Gehenna will spawn a litter of six young, which are immediately sent to the Prime Material Plane to feed and grow.

	"When barghest whelps first come to the Prime Material, they are relatively weak, having only 6 Hit Dice. However, for every energy (experience) level of human (or demihuman) life that they slay or devour, 1 hit point is added to their overall total. Once they absorb eight levels, they gain another Hit Die. Note that 0-level characters are worth only one-half of an experience level to the barghest, so they are considerably less attractive targets than high-level heroes.

It may be that the bulette is hatched from very small eggs, with few young surviving to maturity. Still other sages theorize that the bulette bears live young. There is also evidence that the bulette, like carp and sharks, grow larger as they get older, for unusually large landsharks of 11 feet tall and taller have been seen. Certainly no one has ever come upon the carcass of a bulette that died of old age.": "对布莱特的生命周期知之甚少。它们可能是从蛋中孵化出来的，但从来没有发现过小鱼，尽管6个命中率的小陆鲨被杀死过。可能布莱特是从非常小的蛋中孵化出来的，很少有幼鱼能活到成熟期。还有一些圣人推测，布莱特会生下活的幼崽。也有证据表明，像鲤鱼和鲨鱼一样，布列特鱼随着年龄的增长而变大，因为人们已经看到了11英尺高或更高的异常大的陆鲨。当然，从来没有人遇到过因年老而死亡的布列特熊的尸体。",
	"The bulette has a devastating effect on the ecosystem of any area it inhabits. Literally nothing that moves is safe from it man, animal, or monster. In the process of hunting and roaming, the landshark will uproot trees of considerable size. In hilly and rocky regions, the underground movements of the bulette can start small landslides. Ogres, trolls, and even some giants all move off in search of greener and safer pastures when a bulette appears.": "布莱特对它所居住的任何地区的生态系统都有破坏性的影响。从字面上看，任何移动的东西都不会受到它的影响，无论是人、动物，还是怪物。在狩猎和漫游的过程中，陆鲨会将相当大的树木连根拔起。在丘陵和岩石地区，布莱特的地下运动可以引发小型山体滑坡。食人魔、巨魔，甚至一些巨人，在布莱特出现时都会离开，去寻找更绿、更安全的牧场。",
	"A bulette can turn a peaceful farming community into a wasteland in a few short weeks, for no sane human or demihuman will remain in a region where a bulette has been sighted.": "一个布莱特可以在短短几周内把一个和平的农业社区变成一片荒地，因为没有一个正常的人类或半人类会留在发现布莱特的地区。",
	"There is only one known benefit to the existence of the bulette: The large plates behind its head make superb shields, and dwarven smiths can fashion them into shields of +1 to +3 in value. Some also claim that the soil through which a bulette has passed becomes imbued with magical, rock-dissolving properties. Many would argue, however, that these benefits are scarcely worth the price.": "布莱特的存在只有一个已知的好处。它头部后面的大板块是极好的盾牌，矮人铁匠可以把它们做成价值+1至+3的盾牌。有些人还声称，布莱特经过的土壤会被赋予神奇的岩石溶解特性。然而，许多人认为，这些好处几乎不值得花钱。",

	"Bulezau tanar'ri are born and bred to fight in the Blood War. With the exception of the vrocks, bulezau are the toughest front-line troops of the tanar'ri hordes.

	"Bulezau can speak the common trade-jargon of the planes with difficulty or communicate with a weak form of telepathy at will. It's a good idea for a cutter to make out like he understands the bulezau perfectly no matter how animallike its speech is, since it's not a patient basher. If a bulezau decides it's easier to tear the arms off a sod than talk to him it won't wait long to act on its impulses.": "Bulezau可以艰难地说出各星球的通用贸易术语，或者随意地用一种弱的心灵感应形式进行交流。对于一个切割者来说，不管它的语言有多像动物，都要表现出他完全理解bulezau的样子，这是一个好主意，因为它不是一个有耐心的bossher。如果bulezau决定从一个草皮上撕下手臂比和他说话更容易，它不会等很久才采取行动的冲动。",
	"Bulezau are quarrelsome, bullying creature that often fall into lethal disagreements with each other. Only the authority of a powerful greater or true tanar'ri can keep them from each other's throats, and even then only if the promise of battle is near. Bulezau live for combat, and regard all other activities as a waste of time. They make poor pickets, sentries, or scouts since they've got no patience for waiting around or attempts at stealth if a bulezau sees an enemy, it charges, and if it doesn't see an enemy, it goes looking for one.": "Bulezau是一种争吵不休、恃强凌弱的生物，经常陷入彼此间的致命分歧。只有强大的大人物或真正的塔纳瑞人的权威才能使他们不互相残杀，即便如此，也只有在战斗的承诺临近时才会如此。Bulezau为战斗而活，认为所有其他活动都是浪费时间。他们是糟糕的纠察队、哨兵或侦察兵，因为他们没有耐心等待或尝试隐身，如果Bulezau看到敌人，它就会冲锋，如果它没有看到敌人，它就会去寻找。",
	"Bulezau may be difficult troops to keep control of, but they're very good at what they do. Once committed to a battle, they hold nothing back and plunge into the thick of the fight with reckless abandon.

	"It's rumored that the tanar'ri lord Baphomet, the patron demipower of minotaurs, was responsible for the creation of the bulezau.

It's also said that Baphomet maintains a bodyguard of fierce bulezau of unusual loyalty and discipline.": "有传言说，塔纳瑞人的领主巴弗灭，即牛头人的守护神，是创造布勒索的罪魁祸首。谣传说巴弗灭与他的牛头人仆人和一些为他服务的tanar'ri交配，但没有办法知道这是否是一种皮毛。还有人说，巴弗灭保持着一支由凶猛的bulezau组成的保镖，他们具有不同寻常的忠诚度和纪律性。",
	"Bulezau are generally well-regarded by tanar'ri of higher station, since bulezau pursue the Blood War with so much enthusiasm that a more subtle tanar'ri can drop out of sight when they're around. Tanar'ri commanders place a high value on bulezau formations and go out of their way to gather such units when possible. On the other hand, less powerful tanar'ri rarely want to be anywhere near a bulezau since the creature's likely to fly off into a murderous rage at the least provocation, regardless of the consequence. There've been engagements where more dretches and rutterkin were lost to bulezau impatience than to baatezu action.": "Bulezau通常受到地位较高的塔纳瑞人的重视，因为Bulezau以极大的热情追求血战，以至于当他们在附近时，一个更微妙的塔纳瑞人就会失去踪影。塔纳瑞人的指挥官高度重视布勒索人的编队，并在可能的情况下不遗余力地召集这些部队。另一方面，实力较弱的塔纳瑞人很少愿意靠近布勒索，因为这种生物很可能在受到最小的挑衅时就飞走，变成杀人狂魔，不计后果。在一些交战中，由于bulezau的急躁而失去的dretches和rutterkin比baatezu的行动更多。",

	"On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and powerlust seen in the individuals of other chaotic races, such as orcs. Fighting among members of the same group, for example, is almost nonexistent. Some would say that this is because they lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite.

The elves are paid from the group treasury, which comes from the booty of slain monsters.": "每个部落都会有一个被视为领袖的牧师，但拥有3级德鲁伊的法术能力。半人马通过狩猎、觅食、捕鱼、农业和贸易的混合方式生存。虽然他们回避与人类打交道，但半人马已经知道与精灵交易，特别是食物和酒。精灵们的报酬来自于团体的财库，而财库则来自于被杀死的怪物的战利品。"
