Flight to other lands proved to be impossible, for the Mists had cut off the land from its neighbours. The patriarch of the Dilisnyas hid himself away in the Monastery of Silver Threads and prepared himself for the night when Strahd would come. In 398 BC, the Devil came finally to hunt and serve his revenge. Leo's preparations proved to be insufficient. Strahd ended Leo's life, but not his existence.

	"Lady Fiona Wachter comes from a family that has been loyal to Strahd for many years. Fiona's beloved husband died of disease some years ago but she has preserved his body and sleeps with his corpse every night since. Rumor has it, that the corpse is not only used for sleeping. At one point, Fiona attempted to gain power by insinuating her daughter, Stella Wachter, into the Vallakovich Family by hitching her up with Victor Vallakovich. The incident ended disastrously, for Victor's cruel words ending up driving Stella mad, and now she thinks she's a cat. For her part, Fiona locked Stella away in Wachterhaus after the incident. If Stella should ever regain her sanity, she will blame the demeaning abuse and exploitation of her mother. In an effort to overthrow Vargas, Lady Wachter started a fiendish cult and masquerades it as a \"book club\". Lady Fiona also employs an assassin named Ernst Larnak a highly skilled man. The one relationship she does not keep secret at all is her (and the Wachter Family's) loyalty to the master of their dread land, Count Strahd von Zarovich.

	"Adran Nalty has been living in the wild for as long as he remembers, taken in at the age of five by a circle of druids after he lost his parents to a wolf attack. The circle of druids in question were not ones of life and blossom but of natural decay. There was something beautiful to him about how both flesh and fauna would disintegrate under the effects, struggling to stay alive until it all disperses in a single last breath or twitch. One may question that fire would be more effective, but that is the one thing above anything that Adran hates, seeing the flames stop the creeping degradation of a blight and overall consuming it. As he became an adult Adran was more proactive at using his druidic abilities to inflict blight amongst living beings - be it beast or man he did not care, as long as he could observe the deteriorating stages of their flesh. It was on such occasion that he had a run in with Lady Fiona Wachter, out on an errand with her alabaster skinned bodyguard. He was in the pursuit of a fleeing commoner, decay already eating through their limbs till they fell at the noblewoman's feet, begging for her aid. Adran pauses for a moment from afar, not wanting to get in over his head, but when the woman instead looked towards the druid, smiles and beckoned him to continue, he grinned widely, baring his rotten teeth before sucking the life out of the hapless victim. Fiona was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth and immediately took to finding out more of the death riddled man before her, learning of the circle of druids he was bonded with at Yester Hill and his desire to see everything crumble to dust. Fiona in turn urged Adran to join forces with her. She could provide him numerous individuals, enemies to her but for him, life to slowly disintegrate. Adran was quick to agree and while the nobleman left with growing thoughts of how achieving her goals will happen so swiftly, the druid himself had other thoughts. The fact of the matter was while Fiona was speaking and working her magic to earn the foul man as an ally, Adran was merely focused on how beautiful Fiona would look while he used his blight magic on her, plus the bonus of a full city for his to decompose... it was so exhilarating. For now he will play the role of an ally until the moment arises that he will launch his own plan of attack.": "从他记事起，阿德兰-纳蒂就一直生活在野外，在他五岁时被一圈德鲁伊收留，因为他在一次狼群袭击中失去了父母。那一圈德鲁伊不是生命和花朵，而是自然的衰败。对他来说，肉体和动物都会在影响下解体，挣扎着保持生命，直到在最后一次呼吸或抽搐中全部消散，这对他来说是一种美丽。有人可能会质疑火会更有效，但这是阿德兰最讨厌的一件事，看到火焰阻止枯萎病的爬行退化，并将其整体吞噬。当他成年后，阿德兰更积极地利用他的德鲁伊能力在生物中制造瘟疫--不管是野兽还是人，他都不在乎，只要他能观察到他们肉体的恶化阶段。正是在这种情况下，他与菲奥娜-瓦赫特女士发生了冲突，她和她的白玉色皮肤的保镖一起外出办事。他正在追捕一个逃跑的平民，腐烂已经侵蚀了他们的四肢，直到他们倒在贵族夫人的脚下，乞求她的帮助。阿德兰在远处停顿了一会儿，不想让自己陷入困境，但当那个女人反而看向德鲁伊，微笑着招手让他继续时，他咧开大嘴，露出腐烂的牙齿，然后从这个无助的受害者身上吸出生命。菲奥娜从来不是一个喜欢看礼物的人，她立即着手了解眼前这个满身是伤的男人的情况，了解他在耶斯特山与德鲁伊结成的圈子，以及他想看到一切崩塌成灰的愿望。菲奥娜反过来敦促阿德兰与她联合起来。她可以为他提供无数的人，对她来说是敌人，但对他来说，是生活在慢慢瓦解之中。阿德兰很快就同意了，虽然这位贵族离开时越来越想知道如何迅速实现她的目标，但德鲁伊本人却有其他想法。事实是，当菲奥娜在说话并施展她的魔法来赢得这个肮脏的人作为盟友时，阿德兰只是专注于菲奥娜会看起来有多美，而他在她身上使用他的枯萎魔法，再加上一个完整的城市供他分解的奖励......这是如此令人振奋。现在，他将扮演一个盟友的角色，直到出现他将发起自己的攻击计划的时刻。",

	"Filnen Gustanov used to be of noble standing in Vallaki, his family name commanding a fair amount of respect amongst the merchants and common folk. When he took over the family mantle after his parents' passing, instead of maintaining ties and putting money into the neighbouring businesses his ancestry has long paid into, his wealth turned into funding his growing library of books on the occult. Filnen had always taken great interest in the arcane arts and was captivated by the notion of engaging in a pact with an Other-Worldly being and having access to unlimited power. While a gifted man in magic, try as he might he was unsuccessful in making contact with a patron - unsurprising, truly, given where he lived. He then, begrudgingly, used the books he obtained to become an aptly skilled wizard. By the time he reached his late sixties, nearly all of his family's coffers emptied from his obsession with joining with the occult, he made a journey across town, ready to visit the neighbouring Vistani encampment when his gaze locked upon a mischievous red little fiend like being that was causing some disarray amongst a couple. Their eyes met before the creature scampered away, to which Filnen soon came to an epiphany of what that being was - a beast formed from that of a pact with a patron! Moving as quickly as his weary form could take him, he followed the creature and soon found it meeting with Lady Fiona Wachter. Not one for tact, Filnen immediately bombarded the noble with questions about the creature and what pact she had succeeded to obtain in the world they lived in. While a bit taken aback by the old man's forwardness, Fiona was never one to turn the opportunity away. Taking Filnen under her wing, she explained she was indeed in a pact with a patron and with her help, she could assist with him reaching his goal. She then went on with her plight of how she had grand changes for Vallaki, and those that followed her yet needed firm guidance which Filnen was all too eager to jump on proclaim fealty in exchange for her knowledge. From that day forth he became her general over the other cultists in their faction and despite how old and frail the once noble was, he had an aura about him that both commanded respect and delivered fear to his subordinates. Filnen had no care for those under his foot, seeing them as mere fodder for the fires. No one dared go against him after he made an example out of the first set of fools who tried - he left them in a heaping pile of charred bones and hard plasma. Fiona has no worries of Filnen betraying her and will offer tidbits of information about how to be a warlock - albeit they are only well-thought lies. The old man is known to be wily and tries to garner secrets from the red creature addressed as Majesto, the imp itself more than happy to put the occult obsessed general through pointless task after another.": "菲尔南-古斯塔诺夫曾经是瓦拉基的贵族，他的姓氏在商人和平民中享有相当高的尊重。当他在父母过世后接过家族的衣钵时，他没有保持联系，也没有把钱投入到他的祖先长期资助的邻近企业中，而是把财富用于资助他不断增长的神秘学书籍的图书馆。菲尔南一直对神秘的艺术感兴趣，并被与另一个世界的存在签订契约并获得无限权力的概念所吸引。虽然他在魔法方面很有天赋，但他还是没能成功地与赞助人取得联系--考虑到他所居住的地方，这一点并不令人惊讶。然后，他勉为其难地利用他获得的书籍，成为一个有能力的巫师。当他到了60多岁的时候，由于他对加入神秘学的痴迷，他家的库房几乎都被掏空了，他穿过小镇，准备去拜访邻近的维斯坦人的营地，这时他的目光锁定了一个调皮的红色小恶魔，它在一对夫妇之间造成了一些混乱。他们的目光相遇了，然后那个生物就跑开了，Filnen很快就顿悟了那个生物是什么--一个由与赞助人的契约形成的野兽！他迅速地移动了他疲惫的身躯。他以最快的速度跟上了那只怪物，并很快发现它与菲奥娜-瓦赫特女士会面。Filnen不是一个讲究策略的人，他立即向这位贵族提出了关于这个生物的问题，以及她在他们生活的世界中成功获得了什么契约。虽然对这名老人的直率有点吃惊，但菲奥娜从来不是一个会拒绝机会的人。她把Filnen带到她的翅膀下，解释说她确实与一位赞助人达成了协议，在她的帮助下，她可以帮助他实现他的目标。她接着说，她对瓦拉基和那些追随她的人有很大的改变，但需要坚定的指导，而费尔南非常渴望以她的知识作为交换，宣布效忠。从那天起，他就成了她的将军，统领他们派系中的其他邪教徒。尽管这位曾经的贵族已经很老很虚弱，但他身上的气质既让人尊敬，又让下属恐惧。菲尔南对他手下的人不闻不问，视他们为火中取栗的炮灰。在他杀鸡儆猴之后，没有人敢跟他作对--他把他们丢在一堆烧焦的骨头和坚硬的血浆中。菲奥娜并不担心费尔南会背叛她，并会提供一些关于如何成为术士的小道消息--尽管它们只是经过深思熟虑的谎言。这名老人以狡猾著称，并试图从被称为 \"马耶斯托 \"的红色生物那里获得秘密，这个小恶魔本身也非常乐意让这位痴迷于神秘学的将军完成一个又一个无意义的任务。",

	"Jebediah Zonovan has been in service to Strahd since the second to last incarnation of the ever eluding Tatyana. Originally from Krezk, Jebediah had grown weary of the people around him, finding them weak and simpering fools who believed hiding behind their walls would protect them from anything. Having no ties to any living family, nor any friends or loved ones he cared for, he set off to Castle Ravenloft one night and swore his allegiance to the ruling vampire. Why the human was turned not many of Strahd's minions could understand, except for perhaps his chamberlain, Rahadin, who believed his master saw a spark of his youth in the young man. Since his turning, Jebediah acquired a taste for beauty... albeit a bit skewered. Ravens plucked of their feathers and pinned by their wings to stained glass, to horses sliced open from the belly up and turned inside out with broken bones and to finally his human prey with blood sputtering from their slashed open and skinned necks he keeps as trophies. That which he fabricates he sees as a work of art when deep down it is simply a degraded monstrous game of cat and mouse, a game that he excels rather well in both a battle of weapons or words. The vampire has recently been assigned to be a bodyguard to Lady Fiona Wachter as well as be an informant to his Lord of what the devious woman was conspiring. Jebediah himself finds it a fool's errand, feeling he is far worthier than such simple babysitting duty, yet he keeps to it, hoping to prove to Strahd that he is not only trustworthy and reliable but worth so much more... perhaps even to obtain the title of Chamberlain and Strahd's right-hand man. Until then he maintains his duty over Fiona Wachter however he rather tends to enjoy lording over the Lady's head of how her decisions may not be favourable to Strahd. Fiona herself is not fond of the vampire assigned to her but keeps her opinions to herself as she does enjoy having the added protection for any who try to rise against her.": "Jebediah Zonovan从一直捉摸不透的Tatyana的第二至最后一个化身开始，就一直为Strahd服务。杰比戴亚来自克雷兹克，他对周围的人感到厌烦，发现他们都是软弱无能的傻瓜，认为躲在墙后就能保护他们不受任何伤害。他与任何活着的家庭没有关系，也没有他关心的任何朋友或亲人，他在一个晚上出发到雷文洛夫特城堡，发誓效忠于统治者的吸血鬼。为什么这个人类会被转化，没有多少人能够理解，也许除了他的内侍拉哈丁，他相信他的主人在这个年轻人身上看到了他的青春火花。自从变身后，杰比戴亚对美有了兴趣......尽管有点儿不合群。乌鸦的羽毛被拔掉，翅膀被钉在彩色玻璃上，马的腹部被切开，里面的骨头被翻出来，最后是他的人类猎物，血液从他们被切开的、被剥去皮的脖子上喷涌而出，他把它们作为战利品。他制造的东西被他看作是一件艺术品，而在内心深处，这只是一场堕落的畸形的猫捉老鼠的游戏，在武器或语言的战斗中，他都相当擅长这个游戏。这个吸血鬼最近被派去做菲奥娜-瓦赫特女士的保镖，并向他的主人告发这个狡猾的女人在密谋什么。杰比戴亚自己也觉得这是一个愚蠢的任务，他觉得自己比这种简单的保姆职责更有价值，但他还是坚持这样做，希望向斯特拉赫特证明他不仅值得信赖和可靠，而且价值更大......也许甚至可以获得张伯伦和斯特拉赫特的得力助手的称号。在那之前，他对菲奥娜-瓦赫特保持着自己的职责，不过他倒是很喜欢霸占夫人的头脑，认为她的决定可能对斯特拉赫特不利。菲奥娜本人并不喜欢分配给她的吸血鬼，但她对自己的意见保持沉默，因为她确实喜欢对任何试图反对她的人提供额外保护。",

	"Born in the Vistani encampment south of Vallaki, Heskel was a free-spirited lad, not seeming to have a care in the world. With such a disposition he had a fairly happy childhood growing up. Unfortunately for his parents, he had a penchant of getting into trouble with his people. Heskel never fully grasped the idea of property, or ownership, believing that everything that the world provided was up for grabs and nothing, not even the clothes on one's back belonged to a sole individual. This definitely got him into trouble with the other Vistani when he took their much-desired wine though he often would make them forget of such anger when he would pilfer the pockets of potential customers. One day his lack of belief in ownership got him in trouble when he took a roasting chicken from an encampment of hunters who, unfortunately for Heskel, had no love for the Vistani as they saw them as lesser beings. He was chased down through the woods. Finally he got cornered and beaten on when suddenly the pain stopped. He could hear the agonizing screams of pain coming through the souls of his attackers. Looking up, his breath was caught in his throat, seeing a beautiful woman dressed in red with a grinning imp on her shoulder. She leaned over him and magically treated his wounds. He soon learned that the woman was Lady Fiona Wachter, a noble from Vallaki who was on her way back from a meeting with the Devil when she happened upon him. Heskel at once became very attached to the woman and asked her as many questions as he could, desperate to know everything about her. Fiona felt her heart soften for such a child, wishing her own children had such an eagerness to learn, not only about their mother but the world she lived in. She then decided to take it upon herself to dote upon the child, teach him everything she could. Multiple times during the week she would visit him at the Vistani encampment, and even bring him back with her through Vallaki's walls. Heskel's own people had no qualms with this, seeing the young Vistana as a way to get access to the town they've long since been banned from. As Heskel grew older so did his fondness for Fiona that as she revealed more of her plans for conquest, he became increasingly worried of those that would usurp, or even worse, take her life. This desperation of wanting to protect who he viewed as his pseudo-mother became so strong that he went to seek out none other than Jenny Greenteeth, the hag who lived outside Lake Zarovich. Pleading his desperation for protecting Fiona, the old woman offered an ornate magical mask, said not to only provide healing to those that are wounded but even bring one back from the cusp of death. Heskel immediately jumped at the mask, not even balking when the cost of ten years of his own life was required for its exchange. No price was too great to protect the woman he adored. Since then, Heskel has been training and honing both his body and mind to be a stalwart defender of Fiona. He often would fool opponents in combat with appearing as if he was a fumbling fool fighting left-handed with his scimitar before delivering the decisive blow. His outlook of no one owning anything has not changed and would still leisurely take things from others, even Fiona's other allies. He especially enjoyed stealing from Jebediah, loving when he elicited specific reactions of annoyance or anger that made the undead man oh so attractive in Heskel's eyes. Despite the trouble he caused to the others, he was steadfastly loyal to Fiona and would do anything for her, even laying down his life like a good son would do for his beloved mother.": "海斯克尔出生在瓦拉基南部的维斯坦人营地，是个自由奔放的小伙子，似乎对世界没有任何关心。在这样的性格下，他有一个相当快乐的童年成长。对他的父母来说，不幸的是，他喜欢和他的族人一起闯祸。赫斯克从来没有完全理解财产或所有权的概念，认为世界上的一切都要靠自己去争取，没有任何东西，甚至一个人背上的衣服都不属于一个人。这无疑给他带来了麻烦，因为他拿走了其他维斯坦人渴望得到的酒，尽管他在偷窃潜在顾客的口袋时经常会让他们忘记这种愤怒。有一天，他对所有权的缺乏信仰给他带来了麻烦，他从一个猎人的营地里拿了一只烤鸡，不幸的是，赫斯克尔对维斯坦人没有爱，因为他们把他们视为较低的生命。他在树林里被追赶。最后，他被逼到了墙角，被殴打的时候，疼痛突然停止了。他能听到攻击他的人的灵魂中传来痛苦的尖叫声。抬头一看，他的呼吸被卡在喉咙里，看到一个穿着红衣服的漂亮女人，肩膀上有一个咧嘴笑的小恶魔。她俯身在他身上，用魔法治疗他的伤口。他很快就知道，这个女人是菲奥娜-瓦赫特女士，一个来自瓦拉基的贵族，她在与魔鬼会面后回来的路上偶然遇到了他。赫斯克尔一下子就对这个女人产生了浓厚的兴趣，他尽可能多地问她问题，急切地想知道她的一切。菲奥娜为这样一个孩子感到心软，希望她自己的孩子也能有这样的学习欲望，不仅是对他们的母亲，还有她所生活的世界。于是，她决定自己来宠爱这个孩子，教他一切她能教的东西。每周她都会多次到维斯坦尼营地看望他，甚至把他从瓦拉基的城墙上带回来。海斯克尔的族人对此毫无异议，他们认为年轻的维斯塔纳是进入他们早已被禁止进入的城镇的一种方式。随着海斯克尔年龄的增长，他对菲奥娜的喜爱也越来越深，随着她透露出更多的征服计划，他越来越担心那些会篡夺，甚至更糟的是，夺走她的生命。这种想要保护被他视为假母亲的人的绝望情绪变得如此强烈，以至于他去找住在扎罗维奇湖外的巫婆珍妮-格林提思。老妇人恳求他保护菲奥娜的绝望，提供了一个华丽的魔法面具，据说不仅可以为那些受伤的人提供治疗，甚至可以把人从死亡的边缘带回来。海斯克尔立即跳上了面具，当需要用自己十年的生命来交换时，他甚至没有犹豫。为了保护他所爱的女人，任何代价都不算太大。从那时起，赫斯克尔一直在训练和磨练自己的身体和头脑，以成为菲奥娜的坚强卫士。在战斗中，他经常会愚弄对手，在发出决定性的一击之前，显得自己好像是一个摸不着头脑的傻瓜，用弯刀左手作战。他认为没有人拥有任何东西的观念没有改变，仍然会悠闲地从别人那里拿东西，甚至是菲奥娜的其他盟友。他特别喜欢从杰比戴亚那里偷东西，喜欢他引起恼怒或愤怒的特定反应，这让这个不死人在赫斯克尔眼中变得如此有吸引力。尽管他给其他人带来了麻烦，但他对菲奥娜坚定不移地忠诚，愿意为她做任何事，甚至像一个好儿子一样为他心爱的母亲献出生命。",
