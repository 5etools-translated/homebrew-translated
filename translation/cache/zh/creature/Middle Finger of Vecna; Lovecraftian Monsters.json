	"Neogi can psychically dominate other creatures, enslaving them to their will. On raids, neogi always take new slaves to add to their empire. With the constant replenishing of workers, the neogi have the means to fashion large fleets and dangerous weapons. Lands near neogi territory are always at risk of raids or even outright invasion.": "Neogi可以在精神上支配其他生物，使它们服从自己的意志。在突袭中，Neogi总是会带走新的奴隶，以增加他们的帝国。随着工人的不断补充，Neogi有能力制造大型舰队和危险武器。靠近Neogi领地的土地总是面临着被袭击甚至被彻底入侵的风险。",

	"Neogi undergo three distinct stages in their lives: spawn, adult, and great old master. Spawn are small, hungry hunters, barely sentient.

Great old masters are huge, bloated neogi approaching the end of their life spans, serving as living incubators for the next generation of neogi spawn.": "Neogi在其生命中经历了三个不同的阶段：产卵期、成年期和伟大的老主人。卵子是小型、饥饿的猎人，几乎没有知觉。成体是最常遇到的Neogi--贪婪、残忍、聪明的怪物，对黄金和权力的欲望让它们欲罢不能。伟大的老主人是巨大的、臃肿的neogi，它们的寿命即将结束，作为下一代neogi卵的活体孵化器。",
	"As the neogi were originally from the Spelljammer campaign setting, their culture makes heavy reference to the flying ships that traverse between worlds in this setting, the spelljammer helms. With the help of these flying ships, the neogi spread their influence to every world, and across every world. Thus, trade and piracy are of chief importance to the neogi.": "由于neogi人最初来自于Spelljammer战役设定，他们的文化在很大程度上参考了这个设定中穿越世界的飞行船--Spelljammer舵。在这些飞行船的帮助下，Neogi将他们的影响力传播到每个世界，并跨越每个世界。因此，贸易和海盗行为对Neogi来说是最重要的。",
	"If your setting does not have spelljammer helms or similar airships, you can still incorporate the neogi in your settings in a number of other ways. Perhaps the neogi are a strictly subterranean race, like the drow, and control a similar, or even rival, empire. Or perhaps the neogi launch their raids from the mountains and forests, establishing vast trade networks over land and sea. Whatever the implementation, the neogi are a powerful and formidable addition to any campaign world.": "如果你的设定中没有咒语头盔或类似的飞艇，你仍然可以通过其他一些方式将neogi纳入你的设定中。也许Neogi是一个严格意义上的地下种族，就像乌鸦一样，并且控制着一个类似的，甚至是竞争对手的帝国。或者Neogi从山区和森林中发动袭击，在陆地和海上建立庞大的贸易网络。不管是哪种实施方式，Neogi都是任何战役世界中的一个强大而可怕的补充。",
