	"A red mushroom with white spots. Once consumed, your Intelligence score is lowered by 2 for a day.": "一种带有白色斑点的红色蘑菇。一旦食用，你的智力评分会降低2分，持续一天。",
	"Hidden underneath the everyday world is a dark, mysterious realm. There are some areas lit by phosphorescent plants, but most are cloaked in inky darkness. Narrow tunnels branch off into massive hidden caverns filled with stalactites and stalagmites. The colors of the rock range from gray to brown to tan. Fast flowing rivers lead into huge black lakes that never seem to end. Immense ravines are bridged by flimsy, rotten rope bridges. Streams of lava boil and ooze through solid rock. Elegantly carved dwarf and dark elf cities rise out of nowhere. This dim world is inhabited by many creatures, in fact there are entire societies thriving away from the sun.": "隐藏在日常世界之下的是一个黑暗、神秘的领域。有一些区域被磷光植物照亮，但大多数区域都笼罩在墨色的黑暗中。狭窄的隧道分支进入巨大的隐藏洞穴，里面充满了钟乳石和石笋。岩石的颜色从灰色、棕色到棕褐色不等。快速流动的河流通向巨大的黑色湖泊，似乎永远没有尽头。巨大的峡谷被脆弱的、腐烂的绳索桥所连接。熔岩流在坚实的岩石中沸腾和渗出。雕刻精美的矮人和黑暗精灵城市凭空而起。这个昏暗的世界上居住着许多生物，事实上，有整个社会在远离阳光的地方蓬勃发展。",
	"The dwarf and drow kingdoms stretch for miles and miles. The orcs, duergar, deep gnomes, and minotaurs also have a strong presence. Patrols of humanoids sent out as scouts and spies are everywhere. All the Underworld races have many long running conflicts that will affect any visitors to this land. Hideous monsters lurk in the dark and make this an extremely dangerous place to visit. The unimaginable is ordinary in this bizarre world.": "矮人和乌鸦王国绵延数英里。兽人、duergar、深海地精和牛头人也有很强的存在感。作为侦察兵和间谍派出的人族巡逻队随处可见。所有的冥界种族都有许多长期的冲突，会影响到这片土地上的任何访客。可怕的怪物潜伏在黑暗中，使这里成为一个极其危险的访问场所。在这个诡异的世界里，难以想象的事情是普通的。",
	"Bearing in mind the lack of light and chaotic nature of the Underworld is very important. Many adventuring parties will have to rely on torches, lanterns, {@sense darkvision}, or magical sources of light. However, these sources have their limits. Even with {@sense darkvision}, creatures can only see so far and only shades of gray. Light sources will alert monsters of any visitors. Many of the denizens of this land can see in the dark and will have an advantage. Much of the travel will be in difficult terrain with the slippery ground and rubble littered everywhere. Getting lost in this underground territory is not uncommon. The terrain is unforgiving and unpredictable. Some groups of adventurers might have to rope themselves together. It's difficult to navigate for an hour, let alone days or weeks. Having mounts to carry equipment, food supplies, and other gear will help some groups immensely. Of course, these caravans will have to be protected.": "牢记地下世界缺乏光线和混乱的性质是非常重要的。许多冒险队伍将不得不依靠火把、灯笼、（%0%）或魔法光源。然而，这些光源都有其局限性。即使有（1%），生物也只能看到这么远，而且只能看到灰色的阴影。光源会提醒怪物们注意任何访客。这片土地上的许多居民都能在黑暗中看到东西，并且会有一个优势。大部分的旅行将在困难的地形中进行，地面湿滑，碎石遍地。在这片地下领土上迷路是很常见的。地形是无情的和不可预测的。一些冒险者团体可能不得不把自己绑在一起。一小时都很难走完，更不用说几天或几周了。有坐骑来携带装备、食物补给和其他装备将对一些团体有极大的帮助。当然，这些商队将必须得到保护。",
	"Eventually a party will need to strike a camp. When they do, they'll make themselves known. Food and clean water are also scarce. Adventurers might have to search long and hard for food and even then, they might not be sure what they're eating. Sound also travels in unusual ways in this world. Echoes could confuse the party or sounds from far away could warn of dangers. This is not an easy place to survive. It is a harsh and extremely dangerous land.": "最终，一个政党将需要袭击一个营地。当他们这样做时，他们会让自己出名。食物和干净的水也很稀缺。冒险家们可能不得不长时间努力寻找食物，即使如此，他们也可能不确定自己吃的是什么。声音在这个世界上也以不寻常的方式传播。回声可能会迷惑队伍，或者来自远方的声音可能会警告危险的存在。这不是一个容易生存的地方。这是一片严酷和极其危险的土地。",
	"For the Game Master, it's an easy place to keep the party on their toes. Many areas have narrow tunnels or have the possibility of cave-ins or other kinds of rockfall. Ambushes are easy to set up and put the adventurers at a disadvantage. A group of heroes might have to find their way across an area that has no solid ground. Any enclosed areas could also put the party in a very precarious position. There are also dangerous cliffs to negotiate. A character might simply lose their footing and fall into a chasm.": "对于游戏管理员来说，这是个容易让玩家保持警惕的地方。许多地方都有狭窄的隧道，或者有可能出现洞穴或其他类型的落石。埋伏很容易设置，使冒险者处于不利地位。一群英雄可能不得不在一个没有坚实地面的地区找到他们的路。任何封闭的区域也可能使队伍处于非常危险的境地。还有一些危险的悬崖需要谈判。一个角色可能会简单地失去他们的脚，然后掉进一个鸿沟。",
	"Another element that could add more challenges is changing the way magic works. A Game Master could create an Underworld where magic doesn't work all the time, or in the same way. Spells that help the players travel around might not work in such an alien realm. Magical light might also not work in the same fashion as on the surface world.": "另一个可以增加挑战的元素是改变魔法的运作方式。游戏大师可以创造一个地下世界，在那里，魔法并不是一直在发挥作用，或者以同样的方式发挥作用。帮助玩家四处旅行的法术可能在这样一个异域中不起作用。魔法之光可能也不像在表面世界那样工作。",
	"Overall, the Underworld is a setting that will challenge any adventuring party and the heroes should be prepared for anything.": "总的来说，地下世界是一个可以挑战任何冒险队伍的环境，英雄们应该做好一切准备。",

They put their hearts into their work and guard their possessions day and night. Dwarves are perfectionists who push themselves to the limit. This lawful race doesn't always get along with the more chaotic humans and elves. The main threat to the dwarf kingdom is the orc race! These two rivals have fought wars for many years.

	"One of the most hated of all races is the orcs. Their brutal, chaotic nature disturbs any sense of balance in the Underworld. Many tribes live on the surface world, but a number are also active underground. These scavengers raid settlements and attack those traveling through the strange realm.

Dark elves are closely allied with many kinds of spiders and worship the Spider Queen. The society is matriarchal, but there is a new all-male rebellion that threatens the traditional power structure. This traditional structure is organized into noble houses, clans of relatives and servants. Even within the matriarchy, there are bitter rivalries. Raids, both for gathering slaves and to cause terror, are commonplace. The drow scheme endlessly, and boldly threaten those on the surface world. These spiteful elves hate other elves more than anything. Drow use nightmares and giant spiders as mounts.": "崇拜一个神秘的蜘蛛女王的是一个强大的黑暗精灵种族，被称为乌鸦。这些掠夺性的精灵生活在宽敞的洞穴中的庞大城市。乌鸦是残酷的，聪明的，并且有很高的技能。在他们的定居点里，随处可见放荡和颓废的景象。黑暗精灵与许多种类的蜘蛛紧密结盟，崇拜蜘蛛女王。这个社会是母系社会，但有一个新的全男性的叛乱，威胁到了传统的权力结构。这个传统结构被组织成贵族的房子、亲属的宗族和仆人。即使在母权制内部，也存在着激烈的竞争。袭击，无论是为了收集奴隶还是为了制造恐怖，都是司空见惯的。鸦人无休止地策划，并大胆地威胁着地面世界的人。这些充满怨恨的精灵对其他精灵的仇恨超过了一切。鸦人使用噩梦和巨型蜘蛛作为坐骑。",
	"The evil cousins of the dwarves are the gray dwarves. They are known as cruel subterranean slavers. Duergar are tough, physically and mentally. These dwarves have very negative attitudes and dismal outlooks on the world. Underworld magic has given them some unique powers.
