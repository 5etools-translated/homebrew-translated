On a failure, the creature is {@condition paralyzed} for 1 hour.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 7}击中，到达5英尺，一个目标。{@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4})的穿刺伤害，目标必须在{@dc 14}宪法救赎中成功，以防止被麻痹。如果救赎失败，该生物的身体开始麻木，并且是{@condition restrained}。它必须在下一回合结束时重复这个蓄力动作。成功时，效果结束。失败时，该生物在1小时内会有{@condition paralyzed}。",
	"The abomination unleashes a spray of foul water in a 30-foot line. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic damage and 16 ({@damage 3d10}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	"Standing at nearly six feet tall, the abomination has a head that resembles that of a frog but a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth. Its build is that of a humanoid, but it has skin that is dark, slick, and smooth. It typically walks on two legs, but when it charges after a victim it will go down on all fours, digging into the ground and launching itself forward with its powerful legs. Its webbed hands and feet both end in vicious claws that can tear through flesh and even metal. These combined with the guiding fin on its back allow the abomination to swim at incredible speeds. Being in the water with one of these entities is certain death.": "憎恶站在近六英尺高的地方，有一个类似于青蛙的头，但嘴里长满了剃刀般的尖牙。它的身材是人形的，但它的皮肤是深色的，光滑的，而且很平滑。它通常用两条腿走，但当它冲向受害者时，它会四肢着地，挖地三尺，用它强有力的腿向前发射。它有蹼的手和脚的末端都是恶毒的爪子，可以撕开肉体甚至金属。这些与它背上的导引鳍结合在一起，使这种可憎的东西能够以难以置信的速度游泳。与这些实体一起在水中是必死无疑的。",
	"The abomination produces a potent neurotoxin that it delivers via its bite, paralyzing victims so that it can drag them back to its lair far beneath the surface of the water. The lucky ones drown helplessly as the abomination pulls them down into the depths. The unlucky ones are feasted upon while still alive, unable to move their vocal chords enough to call out for help or even cry out in pain. When especially hungry, the abomination has been known to bury victims up to their neck in mud and allow them to call for help. The abomination will then devour those that come to the rescue.": "憎恶会产生一种强烈的神经毒素，通过咬人来传递，使受害者瘫痪，这样它就能把他们拖回远在水面下的巢穴。幸运的人在憎恶将他们拉入深渊时无助地淹死。不幸运的人在活着的时候就被吃掉了，他们的声带无法移动，无法呼救，甚至无法喊出痛苦的声音。当特别饥饿时，憎恶已经知道将受害者埋在泥土里，让他们呼救。然后，憎恶会吞噬那些前来救援的人。",
	"Many believe these abominations are the result of nature retaliating against the misuse of its resources. A human corpse left to decay in the lake is claimed by a wrathful nature spirit, infused with the sinful waste of the villagers, and unleashed back upon them. There is only ever one abomination living in a single body of water at a time and it is always in fresh water that has been heavily polluted. Some villagers will attempt to make things right by cleaning up these bodies of water and imploring others to do the same.": "许多人认为，这些可憎的现象是大自然对滥用其资源的报复结果。被丢在湖里腐烂的人的尸体被愤怒的自然之灵认领，注入村民的罪恶废物，并释放回他们身上。在同一时间，只有一个憎恶生活在一个水体中，而且它总是在被严重污染的淡水中。一些村民将试图通过清理这些水体来纠正错误，并暗示其他人也这样做。",

	"These alchemists work amongst heavily acidic potions or in areas of ingredient disposal. When corruption occurs, the acid combines with their physicality and causes their blood to turn to become caustic. Most of their body adapts to this acid, but other parts are melted and drip corrosive liquids from open wounds. Every moment of life is agony for these creatures and they seek to inflict this same pain on others. They will tear at enemies with hands that have melted away to bone and will lob balls of acidic bile to melt away their flesh as their own has been melted.": "这些炼金术士在酸性很强的药水中工作，或在成分处理领域工作。当腐败发生时，酸与他们的身体结合，导致他们的血液变成腐蚀性的。他们的大部分身体都能适应这种酸，但其他部分会被融化，并从开放的伤口滴下腐蚀性液体。对这些生物来说，生命的每一刻都是痛苦的，他们试图将这种痛苦施加在其他人身上。它们会用已经融化成骨头的手撕咬敌人，并抛出酸性胆汁球来融化他们的肉体，就像他们自己被融化一样。",
	"Alchemists are often considered to be some of the smartest individuals around, requiring years and sometimes decades of study and practice to create magical potions far beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. An alchemy lab is a dangerous place, however. There are accidents, and the worst amongst these accidents cause the alchemists themselves to become bound to their own ingredients and tools. When this happens, the formerly advanced mind is reduced to that of a feral beast with physical manifestations not ever meant to occur in the eyes of the gods.": "炼金术士通常被认为是周围最聪明的人，他们需要数年，有时是数十年的学习和实践，才能创造出远超普通公民的神奇药水。然而，炼金术实验室是一个危险的地方。会有意外发生，而这些意外中最糟糕的是导致炼金术士自己被自己的原料和工具束缚。当这种情况发生时，以前先进的思想就会沦为野蛮的野兽，身体上的表现在神的眼中是不可能出现的。",

	"The alchemist launches a canister filled with deadly poisonous gas at a point within 30 feet. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, taking 38 ({@damage 7d10}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that failed the save become {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. A {@condition poisoned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition poisoned} condition on itself on a success.": "炼金术士向30英尺内的一个点发射一个装满致命毒气的罐子。以该点为中心的10英尺半径范围内的每个生物都必须做一个{@dc 15}宪法救赎，救赎失败会受到38({@damage 7d10})的毒气伤害，救赎成功会受到一半的伤害。拯救失败的生物会变成（%2%），持续1分钟。一个{@condition poisoned}的生物可以在它的每个回合结束时重复这个救赎动作，如果成功则结束自己的{@condition poisoned}状态。",

	"The alchemist performs a swift operation on its damaged component and regains 30 hit points.": "炼金术士对其损坏的部件进行快速操作，并恢复30点生命值。",
	"The construct alchemist is the most powerful of all transformed former laboratory workers. When the accident occurred, these alchemists were in proximity to a golem or similar creation which fused with their body to create a halfman, half-machine monstrosity that maintains some small scrap of sanity. They are given the strength of a machine, with tubes twisting and writhing between flesh and metal and pumping both blood, oil, and other fluids to somehow keep the creature alive.": "构造炼金术士是所有被改造的前实验室工作人员中最强大的。当事故发生时，这些炼金术士与一个格木或类似的创造物接近，后者与他们的身体融合，创造出一个半人半机器的怪胎，保持着一些小的理智碎片。他们被赋予了机器的力量，管道在肉体和金属之间扭曲和蠕动，同时泵送血液、油和其他液体，以某种方式保持生物的生命。",
	"This alchemist alone maintains a portion of its conscious mind, but these instances of clarity come in incredibly painful waves of occurrence. Because of this, the alchemist's mind is susceptible to mind altering magics. It may seem like this alchemist could be saved and redeemed, but any attempts to remove the metals latched onto its brain would result in certain death.": "这个炼金术士独自保持着一部分意识，但这些清晰的实例是在令人难以置信的痛苦的波浪中发生的。正因为如此，炼金术士的头脑很容易受到改变思想的魔法的影响。看起来这个炼金术士可以被拯救和救赎，但任何试图去除潜伏在其大脑上的金属的尝试都会导致其死亡。",
	"Most of the right half of the body has been replaced by metal and wiring - from foot to skull. The left half remains relatively untouched except for a few wires that dig into its skin. Blood flows through a clear plastic tube that juts out just below the lungs and curves up to connect to its brain. Most of its jaw is still human, but some of its teeth have been replaced by jagged metal shards and screws. One of its eyes is a glowing red sensor while the other remains ordinary, though horribly bloodshot. It is the portions where the metal and flesh combine that is truly unsettling though. Metal burrows into flesh with sharpened hooks that pulls and stretches the flesh but doesn't tear it. In other parts, the skin grows over the metal, turning it a deep purple color similar to a bruise. In some portions, the job was not done perfectly and bits of organs are exposed. Bone ribs jut out through the metal panel on the right side of its chest.": "右半边身体的大部分已经被金属和电线所取代--从脚到头骨。左半身除了几根电线钻进它的皮肤外，相对来说没有受到任何影响。血液流经一个透明的塑料管，该管在肺部下方伸出，弯曲向上，连接到它的大脑。它的大部分下巴仍然是人类的，但它的一些牙齿已经被锯齿状的金属碎片和螺丝所取代。它的一只眼睛是一个发光的红色传感器，而另一只眼睛仍然是普通的，虽然可怕的充血。不过，真正令人不安的是金属和肉体结合的部分。金属钻进肉里，用尖锐的钩子拉扯和拉伸肉体，但不会撕裂它。在其他部分，皮肤在金属上生长，变成类似于瘀伤的深紫色。在某些部分，工作做得并不完美，器官的碎片被暴露出来。骨头肋骨从其胸部右侧的金属板中伸出来。",
	"It is nightmarish to behold.": "这是个噩梦般的景象。",
	"A creature that touches the alchemist or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 ({@damage 1d8}) cold damage.": "在炼金术士5英尺范围内，触及炼金术士或用近战攻击击中它的生物会受到4（（%0%））的寒冷伤害。",
