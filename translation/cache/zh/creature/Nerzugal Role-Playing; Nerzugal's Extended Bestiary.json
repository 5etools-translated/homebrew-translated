Its build is that of a humanoid, but it has skin that is dark, slick, and smooth. It typically walks on two legs, but when it charges after a victim it will go down on all fours, digging into the ground and launching itself forward with its powerful legs.

Blood flows through a clear plastic tube that juts out just below the lungs and curves up to connect to its brain. Most of its jaw is still human, but some of its teeth have been replaced by jagged metal shards and screws. One of its eyes is a glowing red sensor while the other remains ordinary, though horribly bloodshot. It is the portions where the metal and flesh combine that is truly unsettling though. Metal burrows into flesh with sharpened hooks that pulls and stretches the flesh but doesn't tear it.

	"The eagle gives a powerful flap of its wings that conjures up a 10-foot-radius, 100-foot-high tornado at a point within 120 feet. This tornado travels along a straight line, moving 30 feet a turn, for 1 minute. The area within the tornado is heavily obscured. The tornado sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.": "老鹰有力地扇动翅膀，在120英尺范围内的一个点上产生一个半径为10英尺、高度为100英尺的龙卷风。这个龙卷风沿直线行进，每圈移动30英尺，持续1分钟。龙卷风范围内的区域被严重遮蔽。龙卷风会吸走任何没有固定在任何东西上的、没有被任何人穿戴或携带的中型或小型物体。",

	"Atop the highest peaks, all creatures fear the powerful giants which can hurl massive boulders with relative ease.

	"While giants have been known to train and use eagles as tools for hunting and scouting, the alpha is known for hunting giants and other large creatures of the mountain. In order for a giant eagle to be considered an alpha, it is required that it kill a giant as a proof of its strength. Most eagles do not survive an attempt, which is why there are no alphas or only one alpha in an entire mountain range.": "虽然巨人已经知道训练和使用鹰作为狩猎和侦察的工具，但首领是以猎杀巨人和山中其他大型生物而闻名。为了让巨鹰被认为是首领，要求它杀死一个巨人作为其实力的证明。大多数鹰不能在尝试中存活下来，这就是为什么没有阿尔法或整个山脉中只有一个阿尔法的原因。",
	"The eagle and its massive wings have full control of the dangerous winds that shriek through the mountain tops and can bend them to its will with a single flap. The eagle uses this primarily to assert its dominance over other eagles, preventing them from flying too close by creating a sphere of chaotic gusts. It also uses these winds for combat, especially against giants. These winds are strong enough to toss aside even the largest of hurled boulders, allowing the eagle to move in close and begin its assault. The eldest of these eagles have even been known to conjure up destructive tornadoes capable of tearing through an entire army, but eagles this powerful are quite rare.": "鹰和它巨大的翅膀可以完全控制在山顶上呼啸而过的危险的风，只需轻轻一扇，就能使它们屈服于自己的意志。鹰主要利用这一点来宣示它对其他鹰的统治地位，通过创造一个混乱的阵风球来防止它们飞得太近。它还利用这些风进行战斗，特别是对巨人。这些风足以将最大的石块抛到一边，使鹰能够靠近并开始攻击。这些鹰中最年长的鹰甚至被认为可以变出破坏性的龙卷风，能够撕裂整个军队，但如此强大的鹰是相当罕见的。",
	"Being around these innate magics for so long gives the eagle's feathers magical properties. The eagles can use them to disable foes, sending off a single feather that will attach to a target and rattle their mind with a psychic assault. This attack also causes the victim to become immobile, allowing for the eagle to easily pick them up and drop them off a tall cliff if necessary. These feathers are sought after by rare collectors and can be used to make arrows of incredible strength. A single alpha has enough feathers to make a hundred arrows and is worth upwards of ten thousand gold to the right buyer.": "在这些与生俱来的魔力周围这么久，使鹰的羽毛具有神奇的特性。鹰可以用它们来使敌人丧失能力，发出一根羽毛，附着在目标身上，用精神攻击来扰乱他们的思想。这种攻击也会使受害者变得无法动弹，如果有必要，老鹰可以轻易地把他们抓起来，从高高的悬崖上扔下去。这些羽毛被稀有的收藏家所追捧，可以用来制作强度惊人的箭矢。一只阿尔法鹰有足够的羽毛来制作一百支箭，对合适的买家来说价值超过一万金。",

	"Sometimes a man spends so much time at sea that stepping on land is a foreign and unnatural endeavor. Often this is by choice - a sailor who spends months at a time out at sea to provide for their family. Other times it is by misfortune. Ships are not safe from destruction and when the strongest of storms roll through entire crews may end up on the bottom of the ocean. On rare occasions, a small group or even a lone survivor will make it through such an incident, doomed to drift at sea until they die from malnutrition or until they happen upon another ship, but typically the former.": "有时，一个人在海上呆的时间太长，以至于踏上陆地是一种陌生和不自然的努力。这往往是出于自愿--一个水手为了养家糊口，每次都要在海上呆上几个月。其他时候则是由于不幸。船只不可能不被摧毁，当最强的风暴席卷而来时，整个船员可能最终会葬身于海洋底部。在极少数情况下，一小群人甚至一个单独的幸存者会在这样的事件中幸存下来，他们注定要在海上漂流，直到他们死于营养不良，或者直到他们碰巧遇到另一艘船，但通常是前者。",
	"On even rarer occasions, one of these survivors forms a bond with the ocean itself and embraces its power, viewing it in the same way a cleric does their deity. The sailor and the sea come to an understanding - the sea shall provide if the sailor shows it the greatest of respect - the respect such a powerful entity deserves. These sailors become masters of swimming, of fishing, and even receive the power of spellcasting to help them through their endeavors.": "在更罕见的情况下，这些幸存者之一与海洋本身形成了一种联系，并拥抱它的力量，以牧师看待他们的神灵的方式看待它。水手和大海达成了一个共识--如果水手对它表示最大的尊重，大海就会提供--这样一个强大的实体应该得到尊重。这些水手成为游泳和捕鱼的大师，甚至获得了法术的力量来帮助他们完成他们的努力。",
	"Even when given the option to return to civilization - their debt to the sea repaid - most choose to stay on tropical islands, far from the rest of the world. Those who do return are never the same. They are often considered mad men as they will spend hours at a time simply staring out at the water, speaking to the waves as one would a lover. If the fisherman is ever taken away from the ocean permanently, they go mad and will either kill the ones who try to keep them from their love or die themselves from the anguish.": "即使被赋予了返回文明的选择--他们对海洋的债务得到了偿还--大多数人还是选择留在热带岛屿上，远离世界的其他地方。那些返回的人再也不一样了。他们通常被认为是疯子，因为他们每次都会花几个小时盯着水面，像情人一样对着海浪说话。如果渔民被永久带离海洋，他们就会发疯，要么杀死那些试图让他们远离爱情的人，要么自己在痛苦中死去。",
	"The fishermen that choose to stay out away from civilization are the most dangerous. Upon meeting them, they seem almost druidic in their respect for nature, constantly speaking of the sea's grace and power. They thank the sea for each and every thing they are given and if anyone questions their convictions. . . the wrath of the fisherman will be upon them swiftly. For those that support the fisherman, they may be rewarded with the locations of long forgotten shipwrecks or buried treasure, but often these treasures are guarded by creatures of the deep even more dangerous than the fisherman.": "那些选择远离文明的渔民是最危险的。见到他们时，他们对自然的尊重似乎近乎德鲁伊，不断地谈论着大海的恩惠和力量。他们感谢大海给予他们的每一样东西，如果有人质疑他们的信念. ......渔夫的愤怒将迅速降临到他们身上。对于那些支持渔夫的人来说，他们可能会得到回报，得到被遗忘已久的沉船或被埋藏的宝藏的位置，但这些宝藏往往是由比渔夫更危险的深海生物守护的。",

	"One of the leading issues with constructs is their permanence of form... well at least for most constructs. The aquatic strider is crafted from several lightweight metal components that are bound together by enchanted waters. These waters are constantly flowing and give the strider not only its form but also the ability to shift this form when needed. These are typically created as part of a team effort of tinkerer and wizard, though sometimes a particularly bright and skilled gnome will be able to craft such a mechanical wonder alone. Like any other construct, they serve their master's will the best they can and are not afraid to be destroyed upholding these orders.": "构造物的主要问题之一是它们的形态的持久性......好吧，至少对大多数构造物而言。水生黾是由几个轻量级的金属部件制作而成的，它们被施了魔法的水捆绑在一起。这些水不断地流淌，不仅赋予了黾勉的形态，而且在需要时还能改变这种形态。这通常是作为工匠和巫师团队努力的一部分，尽管有时一个特别聪明和熟练的地精能够单独制作这样一个机械奇迹。就像其他构造物一样，它们尽其所能地服务于主人的意志，并且不惧怕为了维护这些命令而被摧毁。",
	"The strider's typical form is small and quite quick. It has four incredibly thin metal legs that are nearly four feet long and allow the strider to move through the roughest of terrains with ease. These legs hold up a large cylindrical body with a central glowing core that provides the construct its power. While in this form, it will charge at enemies and impale them with a massive spike attached to the front of its body, but normally this form is only used to catch foes escaping the strider's other form - that of a tank. When the strider changes into its tank form, the slender legs come together to form a long cannon that can fire burst of ice cold water at short range. Its maneuverability is reduced drastically as it no longer has its flexible legs, but the strider's stopping power is increased immensely.": "黾勉的典型形态是小而相当快。它有四条细得惊人的金属腿，将近四英尺长，使黾勉者能够轻松地在最崎岖的地形上移动。这些腿支撑着一个巨大的圆柱形身体，中间有一个发光的核心，为该建筑提供能量。在这种形态下，它可以冲向敌人，用连接在身体前面的巨大尖刺刺死他们，但通常这种形态只用来捕捉逃避黾勉的另一种形态--坦克形态的敌人。当黾勉变身为坦克形态时，细长的腿会合在一起形成一门长炮，可以在短距离内发射冰冷的水。由于不再有灵活的腿，它的机动性大大降低，但黾勉的停止力却大大增加。",
	"While the strider's two primary forms are strider and tank, it is capable of transforming to many other tasks. It can bring its legs together to form a scoop instead of a barrel to scoop debris, it can combine legs to allow it to reach across large gaps, or even take the form of a small boat and pursue enemies in the water at high speeds while firing a cannon. The adaptability of the strider is restricted only by the mind of its creator.": "虽然黾勉的两种主要形式是黾勉和坦克，但它能够转变为许多其他任务。它可以把腿并在一起形成一个铲子，而不是一个桶，以舀起碎片，它可以把腿合在一起，使它能够跨越大的间隙，甚至可以采取小船的形式，在水中高速追击敌人，同时发射大炮。黾勉的适应性只受制于它的创造者的思想。",

	"When one attempts to tap into the seemingly limitless pool of arcane magics the world has to offer and does not exercise appropriate precautions, the result may end with death in a simultaneously beautiful and horrifying manner.

	"Once an entity has found a location it deems suitable, often beneath the streets of an elven city or a local wizard's tower, it will go into a trance as it slowly saps magics away from everything in a three hundred foot radius. Arcane casters within this area take no notice at first, but as time goes on they will develop headaches, lethargy, and sometimes have their attempts to use magic fail entirely. Magically lit torches will cease to burn, magical locks crumble away, and protective runes become useless. This often leads to much larger problems than the entity itself, for this failing magic can cause powerful creatures to break free from their prisons, will cause unrest amongst spellcasters as they make accusations as to the cause of these anomalies, or allow enemies to assault the area uninhibited.": "一旦一个实体找到了它认为合适的地点，通常是在精灵城市的街道下或当地巫师的塔楼上，它就会进入恍惚状态，慢慢地从方圆三百英尺内的一切事物中抽走魔力。在这个区域内的施法者一开始并没有注意到，但随着时间的推移，他们会出现头痛、昏昏欲睡的情况，有时他们使用魔法的尝试会完全失败。用魔法点燃的火把会停止燃烧，魔法锁会崩溃，保护性的符文也变得毫无用处。这往往会导致比实体本身更大的问题，因为这种失败的魔法会导致强大的生物从它们的监狱中挣脱出来，会在施法者中引起动荡，因为他们会指责这些异常现象的原因，或者允许敌人不受限制地攻击这个地区。",
	"As an entity grows stronger, its influence begins to pierce into other planes, draining from them as well. Sometimes this will draw over enemies from those planes, but more often it calls over creatures similar in nature to the entity, such as arcane wyrms.

If these breaches dig too far into other planes, a Mysterious Starcaller may be dispatched to deal with the problem first hand.": "随着一个实体越来越强大，它的影响开始刺入其他位面，也从这些位面流失。有时，这将吸引这些位面的敌人，但更经常的是，它召唤出与实体性质相似的生物，如奥术巫妖。这些微小的奥术元素会围绕着实体，提供额外的保护，以换取实体所吸纳的一些能量。如果这些突破口对其他星球的影响太大，神秘的星际召唤者可能会被派去亲手处理这个问题。",

	"These little creatures resemble tiny wingless dragons. They glide along effortlessly atop of a bed of invisible magic that follows them constantly. Their bodies are mostly translucent, allowing them to hide in just about any environment as only those with the sharpest of eyes take notice of their presence. They are composed of pure arcane energy and can also travel by instantaneous reallocation of this energy to another location rather than standard flight. They can call forth blasts of arcane energy to track down and strike enemies, despite any attempts their target may make to hide.

	"Arcane wyrms travel in clusters of 4 to 6 and will always reside near areas of magical significance. This might be an ancient weapon filled with magic from a long-dead wizard, an area scorched from an ancient magical war, or perhaps an arcane entity that leeches on the magics of an entire city. The entities are their favorite place to reside, but not all are willing to accept wyrms as followers and will sometimes slaughter the entire cluster.": "奥术巫师以4到6人一组的方式旅行，并且总是居住在具有魔法意义的区域附近。这可能是一件古老的武器，里面充满了已故巫师的魔法，也可能是一个被古代魔法战争烧焦的地区，或者是一个吸食整个城市魔法的奥术实体。这些实体是他们最喜欢居住的地方，但并不是所有的实体都愿意接受巫妖作为追随者，有时会屠杀整个集群。",
	"Sometimes a cluster of wyrms grows particularly large and become brave enough as a collective to explore the elemental planes. The wyrms will travel and feed, slowly changing their arcane makeup to incorporate these new elements. As they do, the cluster grows stronger and form powerful bonds - eventually developing a hivemind.

	"Typically when one hears of a creature that worships dragons, their mind turns to kobolds or to cultists who tease the line between sanity and insanity. Dragon knights are humanoids that worship dragons out of respect for their immense strength. They admire the power of dragons and hope to achieve that same strength and wisdom, studying them for years on end as they hone their skills to resemble that of a dragon itself.": "通常情况下，当人们听到崇拜龙的生物时，他们会想到哥布林或那些在理智和疯狂之间挑逗的邪教徒。龙骑士是出于对龙的巨大力量的尊重而崇拜龙的类人。他们钦佩龙的力量，并希望获得同样的力量和智慧，多年来一直研究龙，磨练自己的技能，使之与龙本身相似。",

They are draped in colored cloaks, have dragonscales incorporated into their armor, and speak draconic as fluently as their native tongue. They often wield shields in the shape of a dragon wing and wear a helmet with large metal horns attached, the shape of these horns unique to each knight. After many years of dedication the knight's eyes will change color to match that of the dragons they worship and they gain the ability to unleash powerful bursts of elemental magic out of their shields.": "龙骑士的盔甲闪耀着它所崇拜的龙的颜色，总是擦得很干净，象征着他们的奉献精神和地位。他们披着彩色的斗篷，将龙鳞融入到他们的盔甲中，并像他们的母语一样流利地讲龙语。他们经常挥舞着龙翼形状的盾牌，戴着附有大型金属角的头盔，这些角的形状对每个骑士都是独一无二的。经过多年的奉献，骑士的眼睛会改变颜色，以配合他们所崇拜的龙，他们获得了从盾牌中释放强大的元素魔法的能力。",
	"Dragon knights represent both metallic and chromatic dragons, the good dragon knights almost exclusively emulating the traits of metallic dragons and evil knights following the ideals of chromatic dragons. Even an evil dragon knight is rarely found accompanying cultists or other such organizations. They are primarily greedy individuals who value power and wealth over the happiness of others - incredibly selfish and lacking of vision beyond their own goals. They would gladly sacrifice the life of another to save their own life, but do not go out on the hunt for blood unless absolutely necessary.": "龙骑士同时代表着金属龙和彩色龙，善良的龙骑士几乎完全模仿金属龙的特征，邪恶的骑士则遵循彩色龙的理想。即使是邪恶的龙骑士也很少与邪教徒或其他此类组织为伍。他们主要是贪婪的人，重视权力和财富而不是他人的幸福--难以置信的自私，缺乏超越自己目标的视野。他们会很乐意牺牲他人的生命来拯救自己的生命，但不到万不得已，他们不会出去猎取鲜血。",

	"While the dragoon cannot fly, they often give this illusion to their enemies. Their training gives them the uncanny ability to leap high in the air and traverse great distances with ease, performing powerful strikes as they come crashing back to the ground with the full weight of their armor behind them. The dragoons are limited to light or medium armor or heavy armor made of mithril because of this. All dragoons use polearms as their weapons of choice, allowing them to strike an enemy without fear of retaliation from an ordinary melee weapon.": "虽然龙人不能飞，但他们经常给敌人这种错觉。他们的训练使他们具有不可思议的能力，可以在空中高高跃起，轻松地穿越很远的距离，在他们身后的盔甲的全部重量下坠落到地面时进行有力的打击。因为这个原因，龙骑兵只能穿轻甲、中甲或由密铁矿制成的重甲。所有的龙骑兵都使用杆状武器作为他们的首选武器，使他们能够打击敌人而不用担心普通近战武器的报复。",
	"The sheer amount of discipline and training required to become a dragoon leads them to typically them down a path of good and of honor. They are often members of a kingsguard or of a specialized task force thanks to their unique capabilities.

Most criminals know to simply turn themselves in when staring down the duo of paladin and dragoon.": "成为龙骑兵所需的大量纪律和训练使他们典型地走上了一条善良和荣誉的道路。由于他们独特的能力，他们通常是国王卫队或专门的特遣部队的成员。他们遵守法律，维护法律，就像圣骑士一样，因此这两者通常被搭配在一起。大多数罪犯在面对圣骑士和龙骑兵这对组合时，都知道直接自首。",
	"Dragoons are far more rare than knights, as it takes three times as long to master both a weapon and the art of leaping with pinpoint accuracy. Few are willing to dedicate such a significant portion of their life to a discipline with the risk of failing and never becoming a fully initiated dragoon. On rare occasions, a student who failed their training and was sent away to become an ordinary knight will turn to a life of crime. These false dragoons still possess great skill, but cannot match the skills of one that has been recognized as ready for combat and to serve their kingdoms.": "龙骑兵比骑士要稀少得多，因为要掌握武器和准确跳跃的艺术需要三倍的时间。很少有人愿意把他们生命中如此重要的部分奉献给一门学科，并冒着失败和永远无法成为完全入门的龙骑兵的风险。在极少数情况下，一个训练失败并被送走成为普通骑士的学生会转向犯罪的生活。这些假龙骑兵仍然拥有很好的技能，但无法与已经被确认为准备好进行战斗并为王国服务的龙骑兵的技能相提并论。",

	"While this entity is called a terror beast, its physical appearance is similar to that of a large rabbit. It has comically large, floppy ears, big green eyes, and is covered in light brown fur.

Even though this is the true form of the terror beast, very few will ever get a chance to see it.": "虽然这个实体被称为恐怖兽，但它的身体外观类似于一只大兔子。它有滑稽的大耳朵，绿色的大眼睛，浑身长着浅棕色的毛。与兔子不同的是，它确实有一套爪子和一些锋利的牙齿，但它的体型很小，一口只能咬下小块的肉。尽管这是恐怖兽的真实形态，但很少有人能有机会看到它。",
	"The terror beast longs to inflict fear in other creatures, but unfortunately its ordinary form doesn't help the cause. To compensate for this fact, the terror beast is capable of creating incredibly realistic illusions.

This often is what causes its opponent's to cower in fear and brings tremendous joy to the terror beast.": "恐怖兽渴望给其他生物带来恐惧，但不幸的是，它的普通形态并不能帮助这一事业。为了弥补这一事实，恐怖兽能够创造出令人难以置信的逼真的幻觉。它还能非自然地洞察他人的思想，只需看一眼就能发现他们内心深处的恐怖，并将其转化为自己的样子。这往往是导致其对手畏缩的原因，并给恐怖兽带来巨大的快乐。",

The terror beast relishes in whatever decision the town makes - either send these people away as insane or turn to panic against this unknown monster.": "这种野兽不断地在移动，寻找新的受害者，简直可以把他们吓死。它们经常会徘徊在中等规模的城镇，潜伏在后面的小巷里，等待毫无戒心的受害者在夜间靠近。有时，恐怖兽会让这些人逃走，并散布消息说有某种噩梦般的生物困扰着他们的城市。恐怖兽乐于看到小镇做出的任何决定--要么把这些人当作疯子送走，要么转而恐慌地对付这个未知的怪物。",
	"The terror beast uses a powerful set of psychic abilities to attack its opponents rather than its tiny claws and teeth. It can make a victim think that they are being ripped limb from limb, unable to recognize that their body is still in tact and responding to the pain as if it were real. The beast can even cause a creature to live out its own death, unleashing all of their fears one after another and causing them to die from each of them until their mind collapses under the mental strain.": "恐怖兽使用一套强大的精神能力来攻击它的对手，而不是它的小爪子和牙齿。它可以让受害者认为他们被人从肢体上撕扯下来，无法认识到他们的身体还在，对疼痛的反应就像真的一样。野兽甚至可以使一个生物活出自己的死亡，一个接一个地释放出他们所有的恐惧，使他们从每一个恐惧中死去，直到他们的头脑在精神压力下崩溃。",

	"While imprisoned, there is another unintentional negative outcome - the spirit learns how to turn others to wood and trap them in prisons of their own. It does not have the power to cause this permanently, but it finds great joy seeing the ones that trapped it suffer a similar fate.

	"Zoblins are simply zombified goblins. These shambling entities can be a menace when a necromancer operates over the site of an old goblin village or battleground. The zoblins are comparable in strength to ordinary zombies but some with some unique abilities. Decaying zoblins are actively falling apart and will cause disease, an ordinary zoblin will latch on to targets and continue gnawing until their victim is dead, and a zoblin boss is strong enough to retain some of its fighting prowess. The most fearsome encounter one can have with these small undead creatures is in the form of the horde of zoblins which run down their enemies and tear them to pieces with their sheer numbers.": "妖精是简单的僵尸化的哥布林。当死灵法师在古老的地精村落或战场上操作时，这些摇摇晃晃的实体会成为一种威胁。妖精的力量与普通僵尸相当，但有些却具有一些独特的能力。腐烂的哥布林会主动分崩离析，并会引起疾病，普通的哥布林会抓住目标并继续啃食，直到受害者死亡，而哥布林老大则足够强大，可以保留一些战斗力。人们与这些小型不死生物最可怕的遭遇是以妖精群的形式出现的，它们会冲向敌人，以其纯粹的数量将他们撕成碎片。",
