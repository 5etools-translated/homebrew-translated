	"Of all sapient forms of plant life, the vegepygmy is the smallest and most numerous. As with most species of plants,vegepygmies come in numerous varieties and temperaments.However, their intelligence is not to be underestimated as they more than make up for their diminutive stature by making use of their superior regeneration capable of fully healing them from the brink of death, their expert knowledge of the forest as well as their superior numbers.": "在所有有智慧的植物生命形式中，vegepygmy是最小和最多的。与大多数植物物种一样，vegepygmies有许多种类和气质。然而，他们的智慧不容小觑，因为他们利用能够将他们从死亡边缘完全治愈的超强再生能力、对森林的专业知识以及优越的数量，弥补了他们矮小的身躯。",
	"Regardless of their temperament, vegepygmies make full use of their small size. Despite their diminutive stature, they are able to cover a lot of ground thanks to their ability to merge and reappear into nearby foliage. This allows them to be the perfect ambush hunters as they can continually harry their foes using grass-like darts to launch at their foes before fleeing deeper into the undergrowth. Thanks to their heightened regeneration, they can prove to be problematic to kill, as they can fully heal from all but the deadliest of wounds in a matter of seconds.": "不管他们的性情如何，素食者充分利用了他们的小尺寸。尽管他们身材矮小，但由于他们有能力融合并重新出现在附近的树叶中，所以他们能够覆盖很多地方。这使他们成为完美的伏击猎手，因为他们可以不断地用草状飞镖骚扰他们的敌人，然后再逃到更深的树丛中。由于它们的再生能力很强，它们被证明是很难杀死的，因为除了最致命的伤口，它们可以在几秒钟内完全愈合。",
	"Although vegepygmies have varying degrees of relations with one another, they all do share a common hatred for sentient fungi that seeming has existed for all of recorded history. Vegepygmies, as well as most other forms of sapient plants,thrive on the expansion of the forest and floral assimilation.However, myconids and other fungi are also driven by a similar motive, which often places them at odds with one another. Under most circumstances, this conflict serves as a check and balance to keep each force in check; however, it is often the responsibility of many druidic tribes to ensure this balance is not swayed lest one force gets out of control.": "虽然vegepygmies之间有不同程度的关系，但他们都对有生命的真菌有共同的仇恨，这种仇恨似乎一直存在于所有的历史记录中。Vegepygmies，以及大多数其他形式的有生命的植物，都因森林的扩张和花卉的同化而繁荣。然而，菌类和其他真菌也被类似的动机所驱使，这使它们经常相互冲突。在大多数情况下，这种冲突起到了制衡作用，使每种力量都受到控制；然而，许多德鲁伊部落往往有责任确保这种平衡不被动摇，以免一种力量失去控制。",
	"An unfortunate side effect of this conflict is the emergence of the blighted. The blighted can be best as a mutation that affects many sentient plants as a resistance against parasitic fungal swarms. Although the host managed to resist its effects, it warps the body and mind of the individual. As a resulted, the blighted are driven by a desire to consume both plant and fungal life.": "这种冲突的一个不幸的副作用是枯萎病的出现。枯萎病可以说是影响许多有生命的植物的突变，是对寄生真菌群的一种抵抗。虽然宿主设法抵抗它的影响，但它扭曲了个人的身体和思想。作为一种结果，枯萎者被一种吞噬植物和真菌生命的欲望所驱动。",
	"Kelp vegepygmy's are one of the more dangerous breeds of vegepygmy. Unlike their other kin, they tend to reside primarily in the water, only staging terrestrial expeditions if food is scarce. They primarily reside in the tangled underwater forests of kelp, using these colossal plants as a means of camouflage and entangling their prey.": "海带素食者是素食者中比较危险的品种之一。与它们的其他亲属不同，它们倾向于主要居住在水中，只有在食物匮乏的情况下才进行陆上探险。它们主要居住在纠缠在一起的海带水下森林中，利用这些巨大的植物作为伪装和缠住猎物的手段。",
	"Their favored tactic is to form groups of 10 (4d4) to engage their enemy from a far, flinging grass-like darts laced with a suffocating poison before merging into the kelp to reappear at another location.": "他们最喜欢的战术是组成10人一组（4d4），从远处与他们的敌人交战，投掷带有窒息性毒药的草状飞镖，然后融入海藻中，重新出现在另一个地方。",
	"The flytrap vegepygmy is notorious for its oversized maw and equally oversized appetites. These little monsters rampage through the forest in small mobs of about 10 (4d4) individual sin search of their prey. Such mobs are often led by a single chieftain, which drives them into a feeding frenzy.": "捕蝇草因其超大的嘴和同样超大的胃口而臭名昭著。这些小怪物在森林中横冲直撞，大约有10个（4d4）个体的小暴徒，寻找他们的猎物。这样的暴民通常由一个首领领导，这使他们陷入进食的狂热之中。",
	"Thankfully the vegepygmies never appear in groups any larger than these since they tend to be quite territorials towards other vegepygmies and often enter turf wars with their own kind and other breeds of vegepygmies.": "值得庆幸的是，维格米人从来不会出现在比这更大的群体中，因为他们对其他维格米人有很强的领地意识，经常与自己的同类和其他品种的维格米人发生地盘争夺战。",
	"Sunblooms are some of the friendliest of all vegepygmies,especially towards other plants. They have the unique ability to absorb sunlight and emit it, to throw glowing spores. They tend to be very outgoing, wanting to spread their inner sunlight to other plants.": "太阳花是所有植物中最友好的一些植物，尤其是对其他植物。它们具有吸收阳光和发射阳光的独特能力，可以抛出发光的孢子。它们往往非常外向，希望将自己内心的阳光传播给其他植物。",
	"As a result, they are typically seen in a large community consisting of other types of vegepygmies as well other sentient plants. Sometimes these vegepygmies have taken this friendliness a bit too far, often spurring crusades of vegepygmies into the Underdark to spread their light to its myconid denizens, resulting in a long-lasting hatred between vegepygmies and myconids.": "因此，他们通常会出现在一个由其他类型的vegepygmies以及其他有生命的植物组成的大型社区。有时，这些vegepygmies把这种友好关系看得太远了，经常刺激vegepygmies进入暗黑世界，把他们的光芒传播给暗黑世界的菌类居民，导致vegepygmies和菌类之间产生了长期的仇恨。",
	"The mandroga is the rarest and most elusive of all vegepygmies. One of the primary reasons for this, mandrogas are extremely shy and spend most of their time hiding underground with the only sign of their presence is a small tuft of foliage that absorbs sunlight. Despite their reclusive nature, they enjoy the company of other mandrogas often hiding together in hidden grottoes.": "曼陀罗加是所有素食者中最稀有和最难以捉摸的。其中一个主要原因是，曼陀罗加非常害羞，大部分时间都躲在地下，唯一的标志是一小簇吸收阳光的树叶。尽管他们性格孤僻，但他们喜欢与其他曼陀罗伽为伴，经常一起躲在隐蔽的洞穴里。",
	"However, when disturbed they enter into a wild frenzy as they burst from the ground to scream. This \"screaming\" seems actually only audible to creatures poisoned by darts generated on their body. Once one is disturbed, all the nearby mandrogas burst from the ground and enter into a violent fury, viciously attacking the source of their disturbance. If angered, it's best to leave the mandroga's territory as they will not follow, preferring not to leave their home.": "然而，当受到干扰时，它们会进入一种疯狂的状态，因为它们会从地面上迸发出尖叫。这种 \"尖叫 \"实际上似乎只有被产生在他们身上的飞镖所毒害的生物才能听到。一旦有一只被打扰，附近的所有曼陀罗都会从地上迸发出来，进入狂暴的状态，恶狠狠地攻击打扰它们的来源。如果被激怒，最好是离开曼陀罗加的领地，因为它们不会跟随，宁愿不离开自己的家。",
	"Dandelions are notorious for their mischievous antics. They are easily recognizable by their fluffy bodies and their airborne mobility. These plants always gravitate to anything that sparks their interest. As a result, they typically play numerous pranks on unsuspecting humanoids, such as stealing their stuff and particularly trying to make them sneezing by blowing pollen in their face. Now that I think about it, they have a weird, a fascination with sneezes.": "蒲公英因其顽皮的滑稽行为而臭名昭著。它们很容易通过蓬松的身体和在空中的移动性而被识别出来。这些植物总是倾向于任何引起它们兴趣的东西。因此，它们通常会对毫无戒心的人类进行许多恶作剧，例如偷窃他们的东西，特别是试图通过向他们的脸吹花粉来使他们打喷嚏。现在想想，他们对喷嚏有一种奇怪的、迷恋的感觉。",
	"Despite their friendly attitude, they are rarely found amongst other vegepygmies. It turns out that most other vegepygmies do not like them because the dandelions seem to possess a superiority complex over their other kin thanks to their ability to fly. Based on numerous vegepygmy sources,this superiority complex seems to involve taunting and practical pranks, all revolving around the inability of their kin to fly.": "尽管它们态度友好，但在其他vegepygmies中很少见到它们。事实证明，大多数其他vegepygmies不喜欢它们，因为蒲公英似乎拥有比其他亲属更高的优越感，因为它们有飞行能力。根据许多素食主义者的资料，这种优越感似乎包括嘲弄和实际的恶作剧，都是围绕着他们的亲属不能飞的问题。",
	"Twig vegepygmies are the most common and widespread of all their kin. They are much hardier than their relatives and are capable of enduring most conventional forms of weaponry. They are also distinguished artisans amongst their kin, making incredible structures, contraptions, and weapons forged of sticks and leaves.": "树枝素人是他们所有亲属中最常见和最广泛的。他们比他们的亲戚要顽强得多，能够承受大多数常规形式的武器。他们也是同类中杰出的工匠，能用树枝和树叶制造出不可思议的结构、装置和武器。",
	"Lotus vegepymies are the most beautiful of all their relatives.Their flower-like appearance is quite interesting as each individual seems to have its own unique design with varying number, shapes, and colors of their pebbles. They are often accompanied by an entourage of other vegepygmies who seem to revere them as some sort of royalty.": "在所有的亲戚中，荷花素人是最漂亮的。他们像花一样的外观相当有趣，因为每个人似乎都有自己独特的设计，其卵石的数量、形状和颜色各不相同。他们经常有一个由其他维格米人组成的随行人员陪同，他们似乎把他们当作某种皇室成员来敬重。",
	"When threatened, they prefer not to fight themselves,instead they command their allies to fight in their stand. But if pressured enough, they will use their hypnotic pollen to incapacitate their enemy long enough for help to arrive or for them to make an escape.": "当受到威胁时，他们宁愿不自己战斗，而是指挥他们的盟友在他们的立场上战斗。但如果压力足够大，它们会用它们的催眠花粉使敌人丧失能力，以便有足够长的时间让救援人员到来或让他们逃跑。",
	"Blighted vegepygmies are despised by all of their kin. It is believed that blighted vegepygmies are the result of deviant mutations from those infected by blights and other fungal creatures. However, these mutations seemed to warp the mind of these creatures as well as their bodies, resulting in an insatiable hunger for plants and fungi alike.": "枯萎的vegepygmies被他们所有的亲属所鄙视。人们相信，枯萎的植物人是那些被枯萎病和其他真菌生物感染的人发生的异常变异的结果。然而，这些变异似乎扭曲了这些生物的思想以及他们的身体，导致他们对植物和真菌都有永不满足的饥饿感。",
	"However, this ravenous hunger did not warp their intelligence, as they are still just a cunning as their other kin.Under most circumstances, blighted vegepygmies will not attack humanoids unless threatened or if their territory is encroached. In fact, blighted vegepygmies tend to be more prone to work with humanoids, since often times they share a common enemy. Such deals usually enables the humanoids to deal with any problems associated with sentient plants,while the blighted can satisfy their ravenous hunger for sentient plants.": "然而，这种贪婪的饥饿感并没有扭曲他们的智力，因为他们仍然像其他亲属一样狡猾。在大多数情况下，枯萎的vegepygmies不会攻击人类，除非受到威胁或他们的领土被侵占。事实上，枯萎的vegepygmies往往更容易与人族合作，因为很多时候他们有一个共同的敌人。这样的交易通常能使人形生物处理与有生命的植物有关的任何问题，而枯萎的植物人可以满足他们对有生命的植物的饥渴。",
	"Whenever the vegepygmy takes fire damage, it catches aflame. While a flame, it takes 5({@dice 1d8}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns for one minute. It can use its action to put out the flames.
