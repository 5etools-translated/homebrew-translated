	"When a warlock or dark priest seeks a fiendish patron, devils usually answer. And while devils always keep their word -- even if it's with a twist -- many mortals are unreliable servants unless trained properly. So, devils often require that acolytes first serve as blackthraws (sometimes known a 'wyrd-agops' or 'badh-thraws') to learn strict obedience and to squeeze some of that annoying individuality from their bones.": "当一个术士或黑暗牧师寻求恶魔的赞助时，魔鬼通常会回应。虽然魔鬼总是遵守他们的诺言--即使它是扭曲的--但许多凡人都是不可靠的仆人，除非得到适当的训练。因此，魔鬼通常要求信徒先当黑袍人（有时被称为 \"wyrd-agops \"或 \"badh-thraws\"），学习严格的服从，并从骨子里挤出一些恼人的个性。",
	"In a dark and fiery ritual, the patron fuses the petitioner with a minor, but particularly obedient minion. The result is a sizable two-headed bird resembling a raven or large crow with three legs. It is half black, the rest near-white. The more unruly or rebellious the supplicant, the whiter its half is. But as the acolyte learns to follow the example of its conjoined companions, it fades to black. Eventually, the patron dissolves the union, releasing the petitioner to serve as a warlock or priest. The impermanent nature of the union is why blackthraws are so susceptible to banishment.": "在一个黑暗和火热的仪式中，赞助人将请愿者与一个未成年但特别听话的奴仆融合在一起。其结果是一只巨大的双头鸟，类似于乌鸦或有三条腿的大乌鸦。它一半是黑色的，其余部分接近白色。祈求者越不守规矩或越叛逆，其一半就越白。但随着信徒学会效仿它的连体同伴，它就会逐渐变成黑色。最终，赞助人解除了联盟，释放了请求者，让他作为术士或牧师服务。联盟的无常性是黑袍人如此容易被放逐的原因。",
	"A blackthraw is charged with ensuring obedience and success. Even chance doesn't excuse failure and mustn't spoil its patron's plans.

Its relatively weak form means that its life often depends on it.": "黑草的职责是确保服从和成功。即使是机会，也不能成为失败的借口，不能破坏其赞助人的计划。因此，当它的主人的仆人被派去执行重要任务时，它被派去陪伴（和监视）他们，并将运气转变成成功。它相对较弱的形态意味着它的生命经常取决于它。",
	"Change is inevitable, and sometimes it's hard to tell whether it's good or bad. The cankerbeast, however, leaves no doubt:the change it brings is truly horrific. Despite this certainty, little else is known about it. Sages debate whether it is an exiled devil or a refugee of an inner plane. Others point to the dead god Moander or Sigil and a creature named Slugosith.": "变化是不可避免的，有时很难说它是好是坏。然而，口疮兽毫无疑问：它带来的变化是真正可怕的。尽管有这种确定性，但人们对它的其他情况知之甚少。贤者们争论它是否是一个被放逐的魔鬼或一个内界的难民。还有人指出，死神莫安德或西格尔以及一个名为Slugosith的生物。",
	"A cankerbeast begins as a larva that appears similar to an olive-colored ooze with faint purple patches. In this form, it stealthily seeks out a potential humanoid host and incapacitates it with its slime. It quickly and surreptitiously inserts a long tendril into an orifice, which then detaches from the slimy green mass, infesting the humanoid's body and mind. The rest of the larva is abandoned, instantly a husk that soon dissolves.": "腐臭兽开始时是一个幼虫，看起来类似于一个带有微弱紫色斑点的橄榄色渗出物。在这种形态下，它悄悄地寻找潜在的人形宿主，用它的粘液使其丧失能力。它迅速地、偷偷地将一根长长的卷须插入一个孔洞，然后从粘稠的绿色块状物中分离出来，侵占人形生物的身体和思想。幼虫的其余部分被抛弃了，瞬间变成了一个很快就会溶解的空壳。",
	"For the next three months the larva grows inside, while its increasingly weak-willed host unconciously avoids anything that could harm it. During this time, a host can be cured and the larva destroyed by magic that cures diseases. But if left untreated, the host is gradually disfigured, developing in the last month a slight hunchback, goiters or what may look like a serious bruise on its back. With just 24 hours left, the host grows weary (gains three levels of exhaustion), begins vomiting blood and its skin becomes slimy and shifts to a vile purple-green hue. When the host's swollen skin finally shreds, a viscid mucus flows out and hardens into a mature cankerbeast with complete control.": "在接下来的三个月里，幼虫在里面生长，而其意志越来越薄弱的宿主则不自觉地避开任何可能伤害它的东西。在这段时间里，宿主可以被治愈，幼虫可以被治愈疾病的魔法消灭。但如果不加以治疗，宿主就会逐渐毁容，在最后一个月发展成轻微的驼背、甲状腺肿或看起来像背上的严重瘀伤。只剩下24小时时，宿主变得疲惫不堪（获得三级疲惫），开始吐血，其皮肤变得粘稠，转变为可恶的紫绿色。当宿主肿胀的皮肤最终被撕碎时，一种粘稠的粘液流出，并硬化成一个具有完全控制力的成熟的腐烂兽。",
	"Once mature, the cankerbeast has access to its former host's mind. Memories and the humanoid's voice are eagerly used to lure potential meals. Unfortunately, the mind is also clouded by the humanoid's insanity-inducing condition.": "一旦成熟，腐齿兽就可以进入其前主人的大脑。记忆和人形的声音被热切地用来引诱潜在的食物。不幸的是，它的头脑也被人形的精神错乱状况所蒙蔽。",
	"Each cankerbeast incubates larvae in the belly of its host. It has the option of vomiting them out to fend for themselves or ejecting them directly onto their own host. The latter covers the victim with a dark, poisonous slime containing the larva.": "每只腐臭兽在其宿主的肚子里孵化幼虫。它可以选择把它们吐出来自生自灭，或者直接把它们喷射到自己的宿主身上。后者会用含有幼虫的黑色有毒粘液覆盖受害者。",
	"When a host dies (from wounds, wear and tear or age), a cankerbeast consumes the remnants and reverts to larval form. It then slinks off to seek its next host.": "当宿主死亡时（由于伤口、磨损或老化），腐尸会吞噬残余物并恢复到幼虫形态。然后它溜走，寻找它的下一个宿主。",
	"If the cankerbeast is slaughtered, a merciful death is usually better than freeing the host. Not only is a heal spell or similarly powerful magic required to prevent immediate death, but restoring sanity may be impossible.": "如果口腔溃疡兽被宰杀，仁慈的死亡通常比释放宿主更好。不仅需要治疗法术或类似的强大魔法来防止立即死亡，而且恢复理智可能是不可能的。",
	"Embrace. The transformation into a cankerbeast seems to be a hellish pit providing enduring torment. Yet, some accept it willingly and others even worship cankerbeasts. This most frequently occurs among communities that have abandoned or outright mock the idea of serving gods in this and the next life. Instead, they seek immediate, more tangible power. Among these people, a cankerbeast can find fertile ground for its larva.": "拥抱。变成腐齿兽似乎是一个地狱般的坑，提供持久的折磨。然而，有些人心甘情愿地接受它，有些人甚至崇拜腐齿兽。这种情况最常发生在那些已经放弃或彻底嘲笑在今生和来世为神灵服务的想法的群体中。相反，他们寻求直接的、更具体的权力。在这些人中，腐尸可以为其幼虫找到肥沃的土壤。",

	"Somewhat counterintuitively, devils encourage communities to develop hierarchies to restrict the blessings of 'rebirth'. This way long-lived cankerbeasts (thought to be immortal) enslave entire communities that produce generations of hosts, and devils reap the resulting corrupted souls. Cultists believe that the host becomes one with the cankerbeast, being absorbed during each mature manifestation. They will claim to notice changes in behavior as the abomination acquires memories and preferences from a host. As a result, cultists will use both the cankerbeast's name and the name of its current host. Cultist may even take a cankerbeast's name before becoming a host, signifying their status as the next in line.": "有点反直觉的是，魔鬼鼓励社区发展等级制度以限制 \"重生 \"的祝福。这样，长寿的腐尸（被认为是不朽的）奴役了整个社区，产生了一代又一代的宿主，而魔鬼则收获了由此产生的腐败的灵魂。崇拜者认为，宿主与腐尸融为一体，在每次成熟的表现中被吸收。他们会声称注意到行为的变化，因为憎恶从宿主那里获得了记忆和偏好。因此，崇拜者会同时使用腐齿兽的名字和它当前宿主的名字。崇拜者甚至可以在成为宿主之前就使用腐烂兽的名字，以表示他们作为下一任的地位。",
	"Most who become a cankerbeast's host are truly victims of misfortune, but a few are mad enough to do so deliberately. These delusionals use aberrant rituals to bind the cankerbeast.

Their talent at quickly altering their appearance becomes so potent that they can redirect some spells, instead of merely blocking them.": "偷取吟游诗人的秘密或消耗足够多的奥术师的大脑的Dooplegangers会变成fleaflesh。他们融入的知识，无论是精神上的还是有机的，使他们能够获得一些魔法，特别是幻觉、魔法和反咒语。他们迅速改变自己外表的天赋变得如此强大，以至于他们可以重定向一些法术，而不是仅仅阻挡它们。",
	"The fleetflesh's swift shapeshifting also allows them to confuse foes by briefly appearing as an attacker's ally or an innocent. The fleetflesh usually leverages this by working with other doppelgangers, giving them an edge in combat and, if things go poorly, a chance to blend in and escape.": "舰队肉体的迅速变身也使他们能够通过短暂地出现在攻击者的盟友或无辜者面前来迷惑敌人。舰队肉体通常通过与其他二重身合作来利用这一点，使他们在战斗中获得优势，如果情况不妙，也有机会混入并逃脱。",

	"Iron Devils are often deployed against spellcasters, but not because of their magic resistance. They are impossibly loud and wreak havoc with anyone's ability to concentrate—on spells or anything else. Surprise attack is impossible as any movement produces a harsh cacophony of metal grating on metal.": "铁魔经常被用来对付施法者，但不是因为他们的魔法抵抗力。它们的声音大得惊人，对任何人集中精力施展法术或其他东西的能力都造成了破坏。突袭是不可能的，因为任何运动都会产生金属摩擦的刺耳声响。",
	"When a shadow rises from a corpse (see the Shadow entry in the Monster Manual) and the corpse is reanimated, dark magics can reattach the shadow and infuse the resulting anathema with the essence of the Shadowfell. These dreadful, towering horrors are macroscians and are usually created by powerful necromancers or hags seeking a potent guardian that will create additional minions as it slays.": "当阴影从尸体中升起时（见《怪物手册》中的阴影条目），尸体被重新激活，黑暗魔法可以将阴影重新连接起来，并为所产生的恶灵注入阴影之城的精华。这些可怕的、高耸入云的恐怖之物是宏伟的，通常是由强大的死灵法师或女巫创造的，他们寻求一个强大的守护者，并在杀戮时创造更多的爪牙。",

	"A necromantic ritual is needed before the link between shadow and body can be reestablished. It works best when performed at a shadow crossing, forlorn places where the veil between the Material and the Shadowfell are especially porous. At the very least, a corpse must be animated on a moonless night and 'offerings' must be used to draw out and snare the shadow. Once present, the shadow must be bound to the animated corpse—called a 'shadow tether'—for it to submit to its creator. Botching this step may result in the presumptive master being dragged into the Shadowfell.": "在重新建立影子和身体之间的联系之前，需要一个亡灵仪式。仪式在影子交叉点进行时效果最好，这些地方的物质和影子间的面纱特别松散。至少，必须在无月的夜晚让一具尸体活过来，并且必须用 \"祭品 \"来引出和诱捕影子。一旦出现，影子必须被束缚在被激活的尸体上，即所谓的 \"影子拴\"，这样它才会服从于它的创造者。如果这个步骤失败，可能会导致假定的主人被拖入阴影地带。",
	"Held fast by the snare, the shadow grows and expands as negative energy pours into it from the Shadowfell. Rapidly, the bedimmed atrocity fully envelopes its shadow tether. Completely swallowed by the murky shadow-stuff, the reanimated corpse is shielded, existing in a 'gloom shroud'—akin to a perpetual shadow crossing.": "被圈套紧紧抓住的影子，随着负面能量从阴影之城涌入，不断成长和扩大。迅速地，这个暴行完全笼罩了它的影子系绳。完全被阴暗的阴影物质所吞噬，复活的尸体被保护起来，存在于一个 \"阴暗笼罩 \"中--类似于一个永久的阴影穿越。",
	"With so much dark energy inside the macroscian, the tug of the Shadowfell is strong. Only the shadow tether, usually a skeleton or zombie, keeps it on the Material Plane. If the shadow tether is destroyed, the shadow half is instantly shunted back to the Shadowfell where it dissolves into nothingness. The macroscian does all it can to prevent this.": "由于巨蟹座人体内有如此多的黑暗能量，影界的牵引力是很强的。只有影子系绳，通常是一个骷髅或僵尸，使它保持在物质界。如果影子系绳被破坏，影子的一半就会立刻被分流回影子城，在那里它就会溶化成虚无。巨人会尽其所能来防止这种情况。",
	"Despite this relatively straight forward weakness, destroying the shadow tether is perilous. To harm it, one must force their way into the macroscian itself. Anyone that gets past the macroscian's claws and plunges into the complete darkness will find that they has only moments before the lethal domain quickly drains away their strength.": "尽管有这个相对直接的弱点，破坏影子系绳是危险的。要伤害它，人们必须强行进入巨蜥本身。任何越过巨蜥的爪子并进入完全黑暗的人都会发现，在致命的领域迅速耗尽他们的力量之前，他们只有片刻时间。",
	"Like other shadows, the macroscian is motivated by a bestial hunger for violence and murder. As long as its creator provides victims to satisfy this craving, he or she enjoys absolute obedience. Each victim yields up its shadow, which falls under the macroscian's sway. If the macroscian goes wanting, it and its offspring become enraged. This traps the creator in a frightful dilemma: do you keep feeding the macroscian and increase its power or stop feeding it and prepare to face a dark, frenzied maelstrom.": "像其他影子一样，大影子的动机是对暴力和谋杀的兽性饥渴。只要它的创造者提供受害者来满足这种渴望，他或她就会享受绝对的服从。每个受害者都会交出自己的影子，而影子则会落入巨神的掌控之中。如果巨蟹座的人不想要，它和它的后代就会被激怒。这使创造者陷入了一个可怕的两难境地：是继续喂养巨蟹座并增加它的力量，还是停止喂养它并准备面对一个黑暗、狂热的漩涡。",
	"A macroscian doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "巨大的人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"A shadow tether is the corporeal half of the macroscian and stands inside the Large shadow, inside its Gloom Shroud. The Gloom Shroud is a 10-foot by 10-foot area of magical darkness. The shadow tether cannot interact with anything outside the Gloom Shroud and nothing outside can interact with it. When another creature forces its way in, the shadow tether is pushed into an unoccupied square in the 10-foot by 10-foot space.": "影子拴是大影子的肉体的一半，站在大影子里面，在它的Gloom Shroud里面。Gloom Shroud是一个10英尺乘10英尺的魔法黑暗区域。影子系带不能与阴暗笼罩外的任何东西互动，而外面的东西也不能与它互动。当另一个生物强行进入时，影子系带会被推到10英尺乘10英尺的空间中一个未被占用的方块中。",

	"Their penchant for subtlety means that they rely on control of others to further their goals. To obtain this, they carefully observe a lawful society, then charm or blackmail the leadership. Eventually, they either become the power behind the throne or the former elites ceremoniously hand rulership over to their new master.": "他们对微妙的嗜好意味着他们依靠对他人的控制来推进他们的目标。为了达到这个目的，他们仔细观察一个合法的社会，然后对领导层施以魅力或敲诈。最终，他们要么成为王位背后的力量，要么前精英们隆重地将统治权移交给他们的新主人。",
	"The nagas' enchanting words, probing gaze and intoxicating venom make any encounter treacherous. Though they prefer to subdue aggressors before violence erupts, they can still bend enemies into allies during battle. Captured foes have been known to become devoted thralls after hours of torment under the naga's gaze.": "纳迦人迷人的言语、探究的目光和令人陶醉的毒液使任何遭遇都变得诡异。虽然他们更喜欢在暴力爆发之前制服侵略者，但他们仍然可以在战斗中把敌人变成盟友。众所周知，被俘虏的敌人在娜迦的注视下经过数小时的折磨后，会成为忠实的仆人。",
	"Mindsnare naga lairs always include pits, high daises or other impediments to delay attackers long enough for enchantments to take effect.": "Mindsnare naga的巢穴总是包括坑洞、高台或其他障碍物，以拖延攻击者足够长的时间，使魔法生效。",
	"Failure to achieve lichdom is catastrophic—worse than death. But a wrong turn isn't always a dead-end. Of the arcanists that become nothics, a rare few—whether by a fortunate discovery or accumulated knowledge—gain an awareness of their former selves. This confers significant power—power they may not be ready for—and pushes them one step closer to escaping their twisted form. This invigorates and empowers the nothics' dark hope of a second chance at eldritch undeath; even if it may be just another sadistic twist designed by dark powers to cultivate ever greater forms of madness.": "未能实现立国是灾难性的，比死亡还可怕。但转错弯并不总是死路一条。在成为无名氏的奥术师中，极少数人--无论是通过幸运的发现还是积累的知识--获得了对他们以前的自我的认识。这赋予了他们重要的力量--他们可能还没有准备好--并推动他们离摆脱扭曲的形式更近一步。这使nothics对长生不死的第二次机会的黑暗希望得到了振奋和增强；即使这可能只是黑暗势力为培养更大的疯狂形式而设计的另一种虐待性扭曲。",
	"As with their distorted bodies, nothic minds are twisted with compulsive behaviors and ticks. With the addition of many years and an awareness of former power, these problems amplify. The resulting suspicions and ritualistic observances come to firmly rule their tortuous minds, and visitors can run afoul of either, resulting in curious questioning, torment or almost instant disintegration.": "与他们扭曲的身体一样，Nothic的思想也被强迫性的行为和纠结所扭曲。随着时间的推移和对以前力量的认识，这些问题会被放大。由此产生的怀疑和仪式性的遵守牢牢地统治着他们扭曲的头脑，来访者可能会触犯其中的任何一个，导致好奇的询问、折磨或几乎瞬间解体。",
	"The attention of a nothic savant may be worse than the ire of a revenant. If they believe there is even just a mere scrap of useful knowledge inside a victim's mind, they will ruthlessly scour it clean.": "一个无名氏的关注可能比一个复仇者的愤怒更可怕。如果他们相信受害者的头脑里有哪怕只是一点有用的知识，他们就会无情地把它搜刮干净。",
	"Anything nonthreatening or irrelevant to the nothic's goal is ignored. This means that they may continue searching a tome during an earthquake or take only one artifact from a slain dragon's hoard. While obsessed, they will still flee if necessary; death is the ultimate obstacle.": "任何不具威胁性或与nothic的目标无关的东西都会被忽略。这意味着他们可以在地震中继续搜索一本巨著，或者从被杀的龙的囤积物中只拿一件神器。在被迷惑的时候，如果有必要，他们仍然会逃跑；死亡是最终的障碍。",
	"Nothic savants often lair in repositories of information, such as schools or abandoned libraries. As a result of this and their desperate hunger for knowledge, they are tempting targets for the powerful and curious. They aren't ignorant of this. So, nothic savants aggressively barter or leverage their position to pry secrets from others. Some even use blackmail. However, their solitary, uncooperative nature and crushing paranoia make creating and controlling a network of spies and agents almost unthinkable.": "诺特知识分子经常躲在信息库中，如学校或废弃的图书馆。由于这一点以及他们对知识的迫切渴望，他们是有权势和好奇心的人的诱人目标。他们并不是不知道这一点。因此，无知的人积极地以物易物，或利用他们的地位从别人那里撬出秘密。有些人甚至使用敲诈手段。然而，他们独来独往、不合作的天性和严重的偏执狂使得创建和控制一个间谍和特工网络几乎是不可想象的。",
	"Nothic savants would no sooner burn a book they hadn't read than kill someone on sight. Their monomania demands that they determine whether or not any intelligent creature they encounter has some clue that will help them achieve their ultimate goal. They'll first observe, usually using their truesight while obscured by magical darkness or fog. If they determine that a creature doesn't have or know anything useful, it is considered a potential meal and attacked (from concealment). Only other nothics exceed this rule; their ability to gather lore makes them more useful alive.": "诺特式知识分子不会很快烧掉一本他们没有读过的书，而是当场杀人。他们的自恋要求他们确定他们遇到的任何智能生物是否有一些线索，可以帮助他们实现最终目标。他们首先会观察，通常在被魔法黑暗或雾气遮蔽的情况下使用他们的真视力。如果他们确定一个生物没有或不知道任何有用的东西，那么它就会被视为潜在的食物，并被攻击（从隐蔽处）。只有其他nothics超过了这一规则；他们收集传说的能力使他们活着更有用。",
	"Since the nothic savant is convinced that it still has a chance to become a lich, it collects knowledge at a frenetic pace. Over decades—almost as a physical manifestation of obsession—its lair becomes piled with the detritus of failed experiments, eldritch cul-de-sacs and projects 'in progress' or abandoned. The debris may even become so deep that an odd apparatus of Kwalish or lair guardian will lie beneath. All of this makes walking a bit tricky.": "由于Nothic savant确信自己仍有机会成为一个巫师，所以它以一种疯狂的速度收集知识。几十年来--几乎是痴迷的物理表现--它的巢穴堆满了失败的实验、长生不老的死胡同和 \"正在进行 \"或被放弃的项目的残渣。这些碎片甚至可能变得如此之深，以至于下面会躺着一个古怪的Kwalish或巢穴守护者的仪器。所有这些都使行走变得有点棘手。",
	"In addition to creating a treacherous network riddled with hidden passages and intentional or accidental traps, the mounds of books (whole or shredded in fits of frustration), shattered staves, snapped wands, magical beast bones, torn cloaks, broken weapons and decaying spell components spill arcane energy, infusing the lair with latent power. The nothic savant draws on this to ward the area against potentially devastating fires (flames are extinguished and fire spells fail instantly) and protect it from intruders.": "除了创造一个充满隐秘通道和有意或无意陷阱的险恶网络外，那些堆积如山的书籍（完整的或在沮丧时被撕碎的）、破碎的木板、折断的魔杖、魔兽的骨头、撕裂的斗篷、破碎的武器和腐烂的法术组件都会散发出奥术能量，为巢穴注入潜在的力量。Nothic savant利用这一点来抵御潜在的破坏性火灾（火焰被扑灭，火系法术立即失效），并保护它不受入侵者的影响。",
	"At the heart of the rubbish is the nothic savant's 'nest', where it keeps its greatest treasures. Even if the nothic savant is defeated, the nest is so deep into the warren that finding its treasures and anything else of value may prove impossible and deadly.": "在这些垃圾的中心是nothic savant的 \"巢穴\"，它把最重要的宝藏放在那里。即使被打败了，巢穴是如此的深入丛林，要找到它的宝藏和其他有价值的东西可能是不可能的，也是致命的。",

	"To simulate the danger and confusion of the nothic savant's labyrinth, treat the lair as if it is protected by a permanent guards and wards spell and make the terrain difficult for everyone but the nothic savant and minions it controls. The lair may also be dotted with mundane traps (strategically or accidentally balanced piles, collapsing floors, volatile chemicals, sharp or heavy objects, etc.) and—since nothics distrust the living—animated objects, defective constructs and/or undead servants.": "为了模拟nothic savant的迷宫的危险和混乱，将巢穴视为受到永久的守卫和防护法术的保护，并使地形对除了nothic savant和其控制的爪牙之外的所有人都很困难。巢穴中也可能会有一些普通的陷阱（战略性的或意外的平衡堆积物、倒塌的地板、挥发性的化学物质、尖锐或沉重的物体等等），以及--由于非人不信任活人--有生命的物体、有缺陷的构造物和/或亡灵仆人。",
	"There is a lengthy transition from the instinctive, near-bestial nothic to the nothic savant. A common nothic only starts the journey if it discovers a significant arcane secret (perhaps a tome of clear thought). Then, as its awareness grows, it begins to retrace the steps of its arcane past and tediously renews its art. This liminal state is the nothic ascendant.": "从本能的、接近兽性的nothic到nothic savant有一个漫长的过渡。一个普通的Nothic只有在发现了一个重要的奥秘（也许是一部清晰的思想巨著）时才会开始这个旅程。然后，随着意识的增长，它开始回溯其奥秘的过去，乏味地更新其艺术。这种边缘状态就是Nothic ascendant。",
	"The genesis of these foul abominations was likely an ancient ritual carelessly conducted by Varpak worshipping ogres. A vengeful, dark deity—most likely Ggorulluzg, but perhaps Tharizdun or the demon lord Juiblex—was offended and cursed the ogres. Strangely, hundreds of years later this hideous curse continues to strike, albeit rarely. Either the slighted deity still holds a grudge or ogres, slow to learn, continue to make the same mistake—generation after generation.": "这些肮脏的憎恶的起源可能是一个古老的仪式，由崇拜瓦尔帕克的食人魔不小心进行的。一个复仇的、黑暗的神灵--很可能是Ggorulluzg，但也可能是Tharizdun或恶魔领主Juiblex--被冒犯并诅咒了食人魔。奇怪的是，几百年后，这个可怕的诅咒仍在发作，尽管很少。要么是被轻视的神灵仍然怀恨在心，要么是食人魔学得慢，继续犯同样的错误--一代又一代。",
	"Uglier and even fouler smelling than their full bodied cousins, ogre slugs are unmistakable: the somewhat-limacine upper body of an ogre and the lower half of a giant slug. A mature adult weighs more than a thousand pounds, stands 8 feet tall and grows nearly 15 feet long. Every inch is covered with a slimy, rubbery hide, making bludgeoning weapons particular ineffective. Coloring is usually pale and swampy gray-green on the upper half, becoming darker along the tail. Alarmingly, ogre slugs are even more thoughtlessly violent and ceaselessly hungry than either their ogre or slug components.": "食人魔蛞蝓比它们完整的表亲更丑陋，甚至更难闻，食人魔蛞蝓是明确无误的：有点像食人魔的上半身，下半身是巨大的蛞蝓。一个成熟的成年人体重超过一千磅，身高8英尺，身长近15英尺。每一英寸都覆盖着一层粘稠的橡胶皮，使打击性武器特别无效。颜色通常是上半部的苍白和沼泽的灰绿色，沿着尾部变得更深。令人震惊的是，食人魔蛞蝓甚至比它们的食人魔或蛞蝓部分更不经意地暴力和无休止地饥饿。",
	"The loathsome hybrids lair in dank, dingy caverns. They consume almost anything, including their own eggs and young if sufficiently hungry, but humanoid flesh is relished and few victims are ever kept as slaves. Ogre slugs have an unusual and disturbing affection for giant slugs and often train them to guard their lairs.": "这些令人厌恶的混血儿躲在阴暗潮湿的洞穴里。它们几乎吞食任何东西，包括自己的卵和幼崽，如果足够饥饿的话，但人形的肉体却很喜欢，很少有受害者被当作奴隶饲养。食人魔蛞蝓对巨型蛞蝓有一种不寻常的、令人不安的感情，并经常训练它们来守护自己的巢穴。",
	"In many ways, ogre slugs are to ogres what driders are to drow—disfigured outcasts, cursed by a god. Yet, unlike driders, the transformation process is not instant and usually isn't isolated to one individual in a tribe. The process may take months and may even go unnoticed by other ogres, until an ogre slug inevitably begins eating other tribe members. At that point, whatever ogre slugs exist either eat the remaining ogres or are driven off.": "在许多方面，食人魔蛞蝓对食人魔来说，就像龙骑士对乌鸦一样--被毁容的弃儿，被一个神所诅咒。然而，与龙人不同的是，转变的过程并不是即时的，而且通常也不是孤立于一个部落中的某个人。这个过程可能需要几个月，甚至可能不被其他食人魔注意到，直到一个食人魔蛞蝓不可避免地开始吃其他部落成员。在这一点上，不管存在什么样的食人魔蛞蝓，要么吃掉剩下的食人魔，要么被赶走。",
	"Ogre slugs are only found in groups if an especially large warrior or shaman (a gifted individual beholden to any being willing to grant power through prayer or pact to such repugnant things) establishes dominance. These 'charismatic' figures grow the size of their tribe to include many slugs and make alliances with less tasty cave dwellers, like troglodytes. Areas around any such group—above and below ground—are quickly stripped of resources. If some outside force does not put a stop to the raids, the tribe usually implodes once food becomes scarce.": "食人魔蛞蝓只有在一个特别大的战士或萨满（一个有天赋的人，受制于任何愿意通过祈祷或契约给予这种令人厌恶的东西力量的人）建立起统治地位时，才会成群出现。这些 \"有魅力 \"的人物使他们的部落规模扩大到包括许多蛞蝓，并与不那么可口的洞穴居民（如troglodytes）结成联盟。任何这样的群体周围的地区--地上和地下--很快就会被剥夺资源。如果一些外部力量不制止袭击，一旦食物变得稀少，部落通常就会内讧。",
	"When the Yugola, the original rulers of Gehenna, created the Yugoloths, they crafted each with a purpose. Among their needs, the Yugola coven had a great many treasures and locations that they jealously wished to protect. So, guardians were scattered across the Lower Planes and beyond. The fiends protecting coins or baubles were no more powerful than goblins, but those that stood sentinel over dark secrets and strongholds were the peers of solars and balors.": "当地狱的原始统治者尤古拉人创造尤古拉人的时候，他们制作每一个尤古拉人都有一个目的。在他们的需求中，尤古拉巫师团有大量的财宝和地点，他们嫉妒地希望保护它们。因此，守护者们散布在下层世界和其他地方。保护硬币或小饰品的恶魔并不比地精更强大，但那些为黑暗的秘密和据点放哨的恶魔则是索拉尔和巴洛尔的同行。",
	"One especially minor guardian was assigned to watch over an icy island outpost between the Plane of Water and the Plane of Air. For centuries, it grudgingly performed its duty in solitude, without word from the coven or any overseer. To pass the time, it traded with (and stole from) locals, collecting lore on obscure locations, arcane runes and ancient secrets. Much of what it learned, it then carved into its own pallid green hide.": "有一个特别小的守护者被指派去看守水界和气界之间的一个冰岛前哨。几个世纪以来，它勉强地在孤独中履行职责，没有得到女巫团或任何监督者的消息。为了打发时间，它与当地人进行交易（或偷窃），收集关于晦涩地点、奥术符文和古代秘密的传说。它所学到的大部分东西，都被它刻在了自己苍白的绿皮上。",
	"At one point during the centuries, the Yugola coven dissolved into violent arguments when pages in a Book of Keeping were destroyed. The resulting chaos made the lonely guardian and its outpost even more forgettable. But, the least of the hags remembered, absconding to the redoubt with a fragmented Book of Keeping.": "在几个世纪的时间里，尤格拉巫师团一度因为一本《守望之书》中的书页被毁而陷入激烈的争论。由此产生的混乱使这个孤独的守护者和它的前哨站更容易被遗忘。但是，最小的女巫还记得，她带着一本破碎的《守护之书》潜逃到了红堡。",
	"When she arrived, the night hag was about to destroy the guardian to cover her trail, but realized the potential of its accumulated knowledge. She offered to use the secrets inscribed on the yugoloth's hide to imbue it with fierce power drawn from the surrounding planes. All it had to do was guard her 'little' book until she came back to claim it. Hungry for importance, the fiend agreed. Her ritual wrapped the creature with hurricane-like winds and encased it in a thick layer of ice. Beneath it all, fused to its body, was the Book of Keeping. She named it Selktas-Veld.": "当她到达时，夜魔女正准备摧毁守护者以掩盖她的踪迹，但她意识到它所积累的知识的潜力。她提出用刻在尤戈洛人皮上的秘密来给它注入从周围世界汲取的猛烈力量。它所要做的就是守护她的 \"小 \"书，直到她回来认领它。对重要性的饥渴，恶魔同意了。她的仪式用飓风般的力量包裹着这个生物，并把它包裹在一层厚厚的冰里。在这一切之下，与它的身体融为一体的是《守望之书》。她把它命名为塞尔克塔斯-菲尔德。",
	"The pact transformed the fiend into a mighty altraloth. As part of the deal with the hag, it wouldn't stay in a single place for long. It would travel to the places it had learned of long ago, be they in the Lower, Astral or Prime Material Planes. In the eons since, the night hag disappeared—still in hiding or perhaps destroyed. But Selktas-Veld continues to wander with its prized hide (and the true names of many fiends) still intact. And to its delight, those with precious knowledge—whether foolish or brave—pursue.": "契约将恶魔变成了一个强大的altraloth。作为与巫婆交易的一部分，它不会在一个地方停留太久。它将前往它很久以前就知道的地方，无论是在下层、星界还是主物质界。在此后的岁月里，夜魔女消失了--仍在躲藏，或者可能被摧毁。但塞尔克塔斯-维尔德仍然带着它珍贵的皮毛（以及许多恶魔的真实名字）继续游荡。让它感到高兴的是，那些拥有宝贵知识的人--不管是愚蠢的还是勇敢的--都在追寻。",
	"Selktas-Veld is a towering monolith of biting ice and frost, veiled by shadow and whipping winds. Its gelid wings seems to dissolve in the gloom and gusts. Wherever Selktas-Veld is present, the landscape quickly transforms into a windswept tundra. So savage is the magical winter pouring from the fiend that water within hundreds of yards quickly freezes and nonmagical fires, even bonfires, extinguish within a minute. The only trace of warmth found anywhere is Selktas-Veld's dim, red eyes, flickering like dying candles.": "塞尔克塔斯-韦尔德是一块由刺骨的冰和霜组成的高耸的巨石，被阴影和呼啸的风掩盖。它那凝胶状的翅膀似乎在阴暗和狂风中溶解了。只要Selktas-Veld出现的地方，景观很快就会变成一个被风吹动的苔原。来自恶魔的冬季魔法是如此野蛮，数百码内的水迅速冻结，非魔法的火，甚至篝火也在一分钟内熄灭。在任何地方发现的唯一温暖的痕迹是塞尔克塔斯-维尔德昏暗的红色眼睛，像垂死的蜡烛一样闪烁着。",
	"Above all else, Selktas-Veld cherishes its uniqueness as the only keeper of the hag's much sought after book. A close second is that it enjoys freezing solid anyone that comes looking for it, taking one treasure—the more distinctive, the better—from each. These trophies, magical or mundane, feed its immense ego. It will scour the planes for anyone that has stolen even just one.": "最重要的是，Selktas-Veld珍视自己的独特性，因为它是巫婆那本备受追捧的书的唯一保管者。紧随其后的是，它喜欢冻结任何来找它的人，从每个人身上拿走一件宝物--越有特色越好。这些战利品，无论是魔法的还是世俗的，都能满足它巨大的自负。它将在各个星球上搜寻任何偷了哪怕只是一个的人。",
	"Each of these spider stat-blocks represent adaptations of real-world spider genera or subfamilies: Mastophora genus (American bolas spiders); Satlicinae subfamily of the Salticidae (jumping spiders); Deinopis genus (gladiator spiders); and Scytodes genus (spitting spiders). None of these spiders weave a typical radiant web and wait for prey to accidentally fly into it. Each is either an ambusher or proactive hunter and only the jumping spider hunts during the day.": "这些蜘蛛状态块都代表了现实世界中蜘蛛属或亚家族的适应性。Mastophora属(美洲的bolas蜘蛛)；Salticidae的Satlicinae亚家族(跳蛛)；Deinopis属(角斗士蜘蛛)；以及Scytodes属(吐丝蜘蛛)。这些蜘蛛都没有编织典型的辐射网，等待猎物意外地飞入其中。每一种都是伏击者或主动的猎手，只有跳蛛是在白天狩猎。",
	"Bolas spiders hang above, camouflaged (often disguised as bird droppings) and rely on an unusual, adhesive droplet of silk on the end of a line. They draw prey close using pheromones to trick specific prey into believing a mate is near. (In game terms, the charmed creature believes that its favorite, enticing thing is very near—food, beer, a specific woman's perfume, etc.) Then they swing their sticky 'bolas' and snare the distracted prey. This feat isn't accomplished using poor eyesight, but their precise 'hearing'. Snared prey is quickly pulled upward and given a debilitating bite.": "博拉斯蜘蛛悬挂在上面，进行伪装（经常伪装成鸟粪），并依靠线末端的一种不寻常的粘性丝滴。它们利用信息素吸引猎物靠近，欺骗特定的猎物，使其相信配偶就在附近。(用游戏术语来说，被迷惑的生物相信它最喜欢的、诱人的东西就在附近--食物、啤酒、特定女人的香水，等等）然后它们摆动它们的粘性'bolas'，诱捕分心的猎物。这一壮举并不是用糟糕的视力完成的，而是用它们精确的 \"听觉\"。被抓住的猎物会被迅速拉起，并被咬得筋疲力尽。",
	"Jumping spiders are active day-time hunters that jump several times the length of their bodies. They use their silk to stabilize jumps or prevent a fall when prey shake them off. Rather intelligent for spiders, they often spend time assessing prey. Then they creep forward, attach their silk safety-line and leap onto their victim to deliver a paralyzing bite.": "跳蛛是活跃的日间猎手，它们的跳跃长度是其身体的数倍。它们用自己的丝来稳定跳跃，或在猎物把它们甩开时防止坠落。对蜘蛛来说，它们相当聪明，经常花时间评估猎物。然后它们匍匐前进，系上它们的丝质安全线，跳到受害者身上，发出麻痹性的撕咬。",
	"Also known as ogre-faced net-casting spiders, these crafty hunters catch their prey using a rectangular, woolly web net. While hanging above, they hold the net downward, parallel to the ground using their long front legs. They wait and ensnare passing prey, then wrap the woolly fibers around them to make escape nearly impossible. For an extra advantage, gladiator spiders have very large eyes that give them a wide field of vision and better night vision than cats or owls.": "这些狡猾的猎手也被称为食人魔脸的网投蜘蛛，它们用一个长方形的毛茸茸的网来捕捉猎物。当悬挂在上面时，它们用长长的前腿将网向下拉，与地面平行。它们等待并诱捕路过的猎物，然后将毛质纤维缠绕在它们身上，使其几乎无法逃脱。为了获得额外的优势，角斗士蜘蛛有非常大的眼睛，使它们有广阔的视野，比猫或猫头鹰的夜视效果更好。",
	"Spitting spiders spew venom-soaked webs that paralyze their prey. Yet, with unusually poor eye-sight (even for a spider) and only six eyes instead of the usual eight, they need other ways to locate prey. So, they hunt at night, use their powerful sense of 'hearing' and often use their long front legs as feelers. As a result, they are slow, but stealthy hunters. This usually gives them the chance to spit several times if their prey is larger or difficult to subdue.": "吐丝蜘蛛喷出浸透毒液的网，使其猎物瘫痪。然而，它们的视力异常差（即使对蜘蛛来说），只有六只眼睛，而不是通常的八只，它们需要其他方法来定位猎物。因此，它们在夜间捕猎，使用它们强大的 \"听觉\"，并经常使用它们的长前腿作为感觉器。因此，它们是缓慢但隐蔽的猎手。如果猎物较大或难以制服，这通常使它们有机会吐出几次。",
	"The six-eyed sand spider (Sicarius hahni) buries itself beneath desert sand and waits. When it senses prey, it springs out and delivers a bite with potent necrotic venom.": "六眼沙蛛（Sicarius hahni）将自己埋在沙漠沙子下面等待。当它感觉到猎物时，它就会跳出来，用强烈的坏死毒液咬人。",
	"The nothic savant quickly assess the defenses of one enemy it can see within 90 feet and determines its strongest or weakest saving throw.": "Nothic savant可以快速评估它在90英尺范围内看到的一个敌人的防御能力，并确定其最强或最弱的救赎方式。",
	"The nothic savant targets one creature it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be shrouded in darkness. The darkness travels with it and covers whatever square(s) the target occupies. The effect lasts until initiative count 20 comes on the next round or until the nothic savant or the target leaves the lair. Otherwise, the darkness has the same properties as the {@spell darkness} spell.": "Nothic savant的目标是它能看到的90英尺内的一个生物。目标必须在DC13智力测验中成功，否则将被笼罩在黑暗中。黑暗会随它而去，并覆盖目标所处的任何方格。该效果一直持续到下一回合的主动性计数20，或者直到nothic savant或目标离开巢穴。否则，黑暗具有与{@spell darkness}法术相同的属性。",
	"The nothic savant triggers a collapse of debris that targets a 10-foot by 10-foot area it can see within 30 feet. Anyone within the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 ({@damage 4d6}) nonmagical damage of the nothic savant's choice and is {@condition restrained} until it or someone else pulls it free. A creature {@condition restrained} by the debris or someone adjacent to the creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check to free the creature.": "Nothic savant 触发了一个碎片坍塌，目标是它能看到的30英尺×10英尺的区域。在该区域内的任何人都必须做一个DC13的灵巧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物将受到nothic savant所选择的14（（%0%））非魔法伤害，并被（%1%），直到它或其他人将其拉出。碎片边上的生物（2%）或与该生物相邻的人可以用自己的行动进行DC13力量检查来释放该生物。"
