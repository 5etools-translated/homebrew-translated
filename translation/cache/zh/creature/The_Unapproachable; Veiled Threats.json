	"When a warlock or dark priest seeks a fiendish patron, devils usually answer. And while devils always keep their word -- even if it's with a twist -- many mortals are unreliable servants unless trained properly. So, devils often require that acolytes first serve as blackthraws (sometimes known a 'wyrd-agops' or 'badh-thraws') to learn strict obedience and to squeeze some of that annoying individuality from their bones.": "当一个术士或黑暗牧师寻求恶魔的赞助时，魔鬼通常会回应。虽然魔鬼总是遵守他们的诺言--即使它是扭曲的--但许多凡人都是不可靠的仆人，除非得到适当的训练。因此，魔鬼通常要求信徒先当黑袍人（有时被称为 \"wyrd-agops \"或 \"badh-thraws\"），学习严格的服从，并从骨子里挤出一些恼人的个性。",
	"In a dark and fiery ritual, the patron fuses the petitioner with a minor, but particularly obedient minion. The result is a sizable two-headed bird resembling a raven or large crow with three legs. It is half black, the rest near-white. The more unruly or rebellious the supplicant, the whiter its half is. But as the acolyte learns to follow the example of its conjoined companions, it fades to black. Eventually, the patron dissolves the union, releasing the petitioner to serve as a warlock or priest. The impermanent nature of the union is why blackthraws are so susceptible to banishment.": "在一个黑暗和火热的仪式中，赞助人将请愿者与一个未成年但特别听话的奴仆融合在一起。其结果是一只巨大的双头鸟，类似于乌鸦或有三条腿的大乌鸦。它一半是黑色的，其余部分接近白色。祈求者越不守规矩或越叛逆，其一半就越白。但随着信徒学会效仿它的连体同伴，它就会逐渐变成黑色。最终，赞助人解除了联盟，释放了请求者，让他作为术士或牧师服务。联盟的无常性是黑袍人如此容易被放逐的原因。",
	"A blackthraw is charged with ensuring obedience and success. Even chance doesn't excuse failure and mustn't spoil its patron's plans. So, it is assigned to accompany (and spy on) its patron's minions when they are sent on important missions and twist luck into success. Its relatively weak form means that its life often depends on it.": "黑草的职责是确保服从和成功。即使是机会，也不能成为失败的借口，不能破坏其赞助人的计划。因此，当它的主人的仆人被派去执行重要任务时，它被派去陪伴（和监视）他们，并将运气转变成成功。它相对较弱的形态意味着它的生命经常取决于它。",
	"Change is inevitable, and sometimes it's hard to tell whether it's good or bad. The cankerbeast, however, leaves no doubt:the change it brings is truly horrific. Despite this certainty, little else is known about it. Sages debate whether it is an exiled devil or a refugee of an inner plane. Others point to the dead god Moander or Sigil and a creature named Slugosith.": "变化是不可避免的，有时很难说它是好是坏。然而，口疮兽毫无疑问：它带来的变化是真正可怕的。尽管有这种确定性，但人们对它的其他情况知之甚少。贤者们争论它是否是一个被放逐的魔鬼或一个内界的难民。还有人指出，死神莫安德或西格尔以及一个名为Slugosith的生物。",
	"A cankerbeast begins as a larva that appears similar to an olive-colored ooze with faint purple patches. In this form, it stealthily seeks out a potential humanoid host and incapacitates it with its slime. It quickly and surreptitiously inserts a long tendril into an orifice, which then detaches from the slimy green mass, infesting the humanoid's body and mind. The rest of the larva is abandoned, instantly a husk that soon dissolves.": "腐臭兽开始时是一个幼虫，看起来类似于一个带有微弱紫色斑点的橄榄色渗出物。在这种形态下，它悄悄地寻找潜在的人形宿主，用它的粘液使其丧失能力。它迅速地、偷偷地将一根长长的卷须插入一个孔洞，然后从粘稠的绿色块状物中分离出来，侵占人形生物的身体和思想。幼虫的其余部分被抛弃了，瞬间变成了一个很快就会溶解的空壳。",
	"For the next three months the larva grows inside, while its increasingly weak-willed host unconciously avoids anything that could harm it. During this time, a host can be cured and the larva destroyed by magic that cures diseases. But if left untreated, the host is gradually disfigured, developing in the last month a slight hunchback, goiters or what may look like a serious bruise on its back. With just 24 hours left, the host grows weary (gains three levels of exhaustion), begins vomiting blood and its skin becomes slimy and shifts to a vile purple-green hue. When the host's swollen skin finally shreds, a viscid mucus flows out and hardens into a mature cankerbeast with complete control.": "在接下来的三个月里，幼虫在里面生长，而其意志越来越薄弱的宿主则不自觉地避开任何可能伤害它的东西。在这段时间里，宿主可以被治愈，幼虫可以被治愈疾病的魔法消灭。但如果不加以治疗，宿主就会逐渐毁容，在最后一个月发展成轻微的驼背、甲状腺肿或看起来像背上的严重瘀伤。只剩下24小时时，宿主变得疲惫不堪（获得三级疲惫），开始吐血，其皮肤变得粘稠，转变为可恶的紫绿色。当宿主肿胀的皮肤最终被撕碎时，一种粘稠的粘液流出，并硬化成一个具有完全控制力的成熟的腐烂兽。",
	"Once mature, the cankerbeast has access to its former host's mind. Memories and the humanoid's voice are eagerly used to lure potential meals. Unfortunately, the mind is also clouded by the humanoid's insanity-inducing condition.": "一旦成熟，腐齿兽就可以进入其前主人的大脑。记忆和人形的声音被热切地用来引诱潜在的食物。不幸的是，它的头脑也被人形的精神错乱状况所蒙蔽。",
	"Each cankerbeast incubates larvae in the belly of its host. It has the option of vomiting them out to fend for themselves or ejecting them directly onto their own host. The latter covers the victim with a dark, poisonous slime containing the larva.": "每只腐臭兽在其宿主的肚子里孵化幼虫。它可以选择把它们吐出来自生自灭，或者直接把它们喷射到自己的宿主身上。后者会用含有幼虫的黑色有毒粘液覆盖受害者。",
	"When a host dies (from wounds, wear and tear or age), a cankerbeast consumes the remnants and reverts to larval form. It then slinks off to seek its next host.": "当宿主死亡时（由于伤口、磨损或老化），腐尸会吞噬残余物并恢复到幼虫形态。然后它溜走，寻找它的下一个宿主。",
	"If the cankerbeast is slaughtered, a merciful death is usually better than freeing the host. Not only is a heal spell or similarly powerful magic required to prevent immediate death, but restoring sanity may be impossible.": "如果口腔溃疡兽被宰杀，仁慈的死亡通常比释放宿主更好。不仅需要治疗法术或类似的强大魔法来防止立即死亡，而且恢复理智可能是不可能的。",
	"Embrace. The transformation into a cankerbeast seems to be a hellish pit providing enduring torment. Yet, some accept it willingly and others even worship cankerbeasts. This most frequently occurs among communities that have abandoned or outright mock the idea of serving gods in this and the next life. Instead, they seek immediate, more tangible power. Among these people, a cankerbeast can find fertile ground for its larva.": "拥抱。变成腐齿兽似乎是一个地狱般的坑，提供持久的折磨。然而，有些人心甘情愿地接受它，有些人甚至崇拜腐齿兽。这种情况最常发生在那些已经放弃或彻底嘲笑在今生和来世为神灵服务的想法的群体中。相反，他们寻求直接的、更具体的权力。在这些人中，腐尸可以为其幼虫找到肥沃的土壤。",
	"Cankerbeast cults are often established by crafty devils seeking a long-term and steady supply of corrupted souls. They teach rituals and ceremonies that celebrate the death of weakness and rebirth as a new, powerful being.": "腐烂兽邪教通常由狡猾的魔鬼建立，寻求长期稳定的腐败灵魂供应。他们教授仪式和典礼，庆祝弱点的死亡和重生为一个新的、强大的生命。",
	"Somewhat counterintuitively, devils encourage communities to develop hierarchies to restrict the blessings of 'rebirth'. This way long-lived cankerbeasts (thought to be immortal) enslave entire communities that produce generations of hosts, and devils reap the resulting corrupted souls. Cultists believe that the host becomes one with the cankerbeast, being absorbed during each mature manifestation. They will claim to notice changes in behavior as the abomination acquires memories and preferences from a host. As a result, cultists will use both the cankerbeast's name and the name of its current host. Cultist may even take a cankerbeast's name before becoming a host, signifying their status as the next in line.": "有点反直觉的是，魔鬼鼓励社区发展等级制度以限制 \"重生 \"的祝福。这样，长寿的腐尸（被认为是不朽的）奴役了整个社区，产生了一代又一代的宿主，而魔鬼则收获了由此产生的腐败的灵魂。崇拜者认为，宿主与腐尸融为一体，在每次成熟的表现中被吸收。他们会声称注意到行为的变化，因为憎恶从宿主那里获得了记忆和偏好。因此，崇拜者会同时使用腐齿兽的名字和它当前宿主的名字。崇拜者甚至可以在成为宿主之前就使用腐烂兽的名字，以表示他们作为下一任的地位。",
	"Most who become a cankerbeast's host are truly victims of misfortune, but a few are mad enough to do so deliberately. These delusionals use aberrant rituals to bind the cankerbeast. They're convinced that this will give them complete control. They're almost always wrong.": "大多数成为口疮兽宿主的人确实是不幸的受害者，但也有少数人疯狂到故意这样做。这些妄想者使用反常的仪式来束缚口疮兽。他们确信这将给他们带来完全的控制。他们几乎总是错的。",

With a tenuous hold on Avernus, Zariel needed all the allies she could find and made a careful gamble by appointing the former marshal, now bearing the sobriquet 'Captain Hogsblood', as commander of her greatest legion. He has served her successfully and—it would seem—loyally since.": "Khal'belok曾经是九层地狱的一名伟大的将军（大恶魔Beherit的元帅--现在已经被摧毁了），但他太害怕了，被其他大恶魔所厌恶，无法为自己赢得新的赞助。因此，他以军阀和雇佣兵的身份在Avernus游荡。直到贝尔背叛扎里尔并随后重新掌权所带来的混乱。由于对Avernus的控制很脆弱，Zariel需要她能找到的所有盟友，于是她进行了一场谨慎的赌博，任命这位前元帅，现在拥有 \"猪血队长 \"的称号，作为她最大军团的指挥官。他成功地为她服务，而且--似乎--从那时起就很忠诚。",

With so many enemies, it is fortunate for him that he is feared.": "猪血的灵感战术、铁血的领导力和个人的膂力使他在许多战场上成为胜利者，无论是在阿弗纳斯还是其他地方。虽然他喜欢战略，但他真正喜欢的是被打败的对手的 \"美\"。在九层地狱中，没有多少人欣赏这种执着，他们怀有强烈的怨恨。由于有这么多的敌人，他很幸运地被人敬畏。",
	"If Hogsblood is impressed by a particular defeated foe or merely wishes to punish one, he chains it to his iron belt. The infernal belt transfers wounds that Hogsblood receives to the victim.
