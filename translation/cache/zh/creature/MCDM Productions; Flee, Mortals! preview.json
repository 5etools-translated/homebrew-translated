	"Good news! if you've run fifth edition, then you already understand how to use most of the creatures in this book. You may see a few unfamiliar details, but fear not; the tweaks we made to creature stat blocks don't take much time at all to grok. This book is organized into three sections:": "好消息！如果你运行过第五版，那么你已经明白如何使用本书中的大多数生物。你可能会看到一些不熟悉的细节，但不要害怕；我们对生物状态块的调整根本不需要花太多时间来摸索。本书分为三个部分。",
	"{@b Bands} contain creatures grouped by theme (like skeletal undead) or ancestry (like goblin, previewed in this document). Creatures in the same band work together and make it easy to build encounters.": "{@b Bands}包含按主题（如骷髅亡灵）或祖先（如地精，在本文件中预览）分组的生物。同一带内的生物可以一起工作，并使之易于建立遭遇战。",
	"{@b Unique creatures} don't belong to a band, though they might ally themselves with one, and aren't restricted to a single environment. Many of these creatures are the MCDM take on classic foes, while others are original. The lightbender and the overmind are in this preview.": "{@b Unique creatures}不属于一个乐队，尽管它们可能与一个乐队结盟，而且不限于一个单一的环境。这些生物中有许多是MCDM对经典敌人的改造，而另一些则是原创。在这个预览中，有 \"光人 \"和 \"超脑\"。",
	"{@b Encounter environments} present themed creatures for places where combat encounters typically occur. This doesn't usually mean broad environments like mountain or jungle, but more specific locations like an evil temple, enchanted wood, or graveyard, the latter of which is partially previewed in this document.": "{@b Encounter environments} 为通常发生战斗遭遇的地方提供主题生物。这通常不是指像山地或丛林这样宽泛的环境，而是指像邪恶的寺庙、被施了魔法的树林或墓地这样更具体的地点，后者在本文件中已部分预览。",
	"Each creature's stat block lists their challenge rating and role in the top right corner. {@note (NOTE: For the purposes of 5eTools, these roles will be part of the creature's type tag.)} The more obvious placement of the challenge rating makes it easier to find stat blocks and build encounters to challenge your players.": "每个生物的状态块都在右上角列出了它们的挑战等级和角色。{@note (NOTE: For the purposes of 5eTools, these roles will be part of the creature's type tag.)}挑战等级的位置更加明显，使得寻找状态块和建立遭遇战来挑战你的玩家更加容易。",
	"Each creature has a role listed next to their challenge rating. Roles are descriptive and typically don't include rules. Most simply help you build encounters and utilize the creature effectively in combat. This book includes the following creature roles.": "每个生物都有一个角色，列在他们的挑战等级旁边。角色是描述性的，通常不包括规则。大多数角色只是帮助你建立遭遇战，并在战斗中有效利用该生物。本书包括以下生物角色。",

	"Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of hit points and deal lots of damage. They might not be the most disciplined warriors, but they make up for it in sheer toughness and aggression. Examples of brutes include the {@creature goblin spinecleaver|FMprev} and {@creature war spider|FMprev}.": "野蛮人是一种坚韧的生物，他们有大量的命中率和造成大量的伤害。他们可能不是最有纪律的战士，但他们在纯粹的坚韧和侵略性方面弥补了这一点。野蛮人的例子包括（%0%）和（%1%）。",

	"Controllers debuff, move, and obstruct their enemies. They often have crowd control actions that target multiple creatures at once or apply a debilitating effect to a target. The {@creature goblin cursespitter|FMprev} is an example of a controller.": "控制者对他们的敌人进行减伤、移动和阻挠。他们通常有人群控制行动，一次针对多个生物，或对一个目标施加衰弱的效果。{@creature goblin cursespitter|FMprev}就是一个控制者的例子。",

	"Skirmishers are mobile warriors that use hit-and-run tactics in combat. Their traits allow them to make the most of their position. Examples of skirmishers include the {@creature goblin warrior|FMprev} and {@creature skitterling|FMprev}.": "小兵是流动的战士，在战斗中使用打了就跑的战术。他们的特性使他们能够最大限度地利用自己的位置。小兵的例子包括（%0%）和（%1%）。",

The swarm of skitterlings is an example of a soldier creature.": "士兵是装甲良好的生物，可以吸引敌人的攻击，使盟友能够在战场上自由行动。这些训练有素的战士通常有较高的攻击加成和攻击力。成群结队的小精灵就是一个士兵生物的例子。",

While not all the information is common in-character knowledge, you can share these early pages with your players if you don't mind them having a little meta-knowledge.": "在本书中，生物部分的开头是对该部分中所有生物的广泛描述。虽然不是所有的信息都是常见的角色知识，但如果你不介意他们有一点元知识的话，你可以与你的玩家分享这些早期页面。",
	"The creature stat blocks aren't presented until the end of each section, allowing you to share flavorful information with your players while keeping stat block spoilers to yourself. In addition, keeping stat blocks together means flipping fewer pages when you run a band of similar creatures.": "生物的状态块在每一节的末尾才呈现，允许你与你的玩家分享有风味的信息，同时将状态块的破坏者留给自己。此外，将状态块放在一起意味着当你运行一队类似的生物时，翻阅的页数更少。",
	"{@b {@i New Rules.}} Action-oriented creatures, companions, retainers, and minions use new rules that can be found starting on {@book page 18 of this preview|FMprev|5}.": "{@b {@i New Rules.}} 面向行动的生物、同伴、家臣和奴仆使用新的规则，可以在{@book page 18 of this preview|FMprev|5}开始找到。",
	"Like all humanoid ancestries, there are many different goblins and goblin cultures, each with their own ideals. Known to themselves as rogabrin, meaning \"more of us\" in Goblin, they are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and places many others avoid, like deep cave systems.": "像所有的类人祖先一样，有许多不同的哥布林和哥布林文化，每个都有自己的理想。他们自己被称为rogabrin，在哥布林语中意为 \"更多的我们\"，是世界上最多的人形生物之一。他们可以在人类占据的每一个环境中找到，也可以在其他许多人避开的地方找到，比如深山洞穴系统。",
	"Their proportionally long arms and prehensile toes make them equally well-adapted to arboreal environments. Goblins live comfortably in treetop cities and subterranean environments with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. Others prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods of diverse cities.": "他们长长的手臂和伸出的脚趾使他们同样能适应树栖环境。妖精在树顶城市和有钟乳石、壁架和鸿沟的地下环境中生活得很舒服。其他人则喜欢居住在不同城市的紧密邻里关系中。",
	"Those goblins that cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of the bunch, thieves and murderers shunned by their own people and driven to live on society's outskirts.": "那些与冒险英雄交手的地精是最坏的一群，他们是被自己人躲避的小偷和杀人犯，被驱赶到社会的边缘生活。",
	"{@b {@i Encountered in Groups.}} In society and in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely (and perhaps overly) confident. Such groups often become bandits that ambush travelers in their territories, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands may become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and flee when foes outnumber friends.": "{@b {@i Encountered in Groups.}}在社会上和流亡中，妖精们因为合作而生存和发展。一个被迫进入野外的妖精会感到恐惧。一打亡命之徒的妖精则极度（也许是过度）自信。这样的群体往往成为土匪，在他们的领地上伏击旅行者，无论是沙漠、森林还是地下。更大的团伙可能成为不择手段的雇佣兵，为强大的恶棍服务。无论他们是如何遇到的，地精都喜欢以压倒性的力量作战，当敌人的数量超过朋友的数量时就会逃跑。",
	"{@b {@i Mobile and Sneaky.}} Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins that survive life in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies' knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.": "{@b {@i Mobile and Sneaky.}}矮小、轻盈、长臂，地精是为移动、隐蔽和攀爬而生的。在桀骜不驯的荒野和曲折的洞穴中生存的妖精利用他们天生的敏捷性来躲避威胁，并在被发现时逃跑。这些狡猾的小兵可能会在战斗中狂奔，砍断敌人的膝盖，或者在树与树之间飞奔时释放箭矢。",
	"{@b {@i Goblin Magic.}} Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities—archfey, deities, fiends—for magic power. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.": "{@b {@i Goblin Magic.}}一些被流放的地精与邪恶的实体--archfey、神灵、恶魔--订立契约，以获得魔法力量。妖精刺客用受害者的灵魂幻化出黑暗，而妖精诅咒者则抛出魔法咒语，让敌人望而却步。",
	"{@b {@i Goblin Retainers.}} Heroic goblins sometimes join adventuring parties as retainers. Their lithe forms allow them to support their allies as stealthy, mobile rogues.": "{@b {@i Goblin Retainers.}}英雄的地精有时会作为家臣加入冒险队伍。他们轻巧的身形使他们能够作为隐秘的、移动的流氓来支持他们的盟友。",
	"A six-legged, winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, appearing to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary blindness.": "一种六条腿、有翅膀的啮齿动物，体型和家猫一样大，在飞行时移动它们的爪子，看起来就像在空中窜动。地精训练这些宠物用爪子抓敌人的脸，因为它们的脚会分泌一种毒素，导致暂时性失明。",
	"Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. The war spider's bladed legs skitter over enemy forces, while archers fire from atop a platform on the beast's back. During raids, the spider flicks their abdomen to launch warriors off their back into the fray.": "哥布林在战斗中骑着巨大的蛛形纲动物作为坐骑。战蛛的刀腿在敌军身上滑过，而弓箭手则从兽背的平台上射击。在突袭过程中，蜘蛛会弹动腹部，将战士从背上发射到战场上。",
	"Queen Bargnot, Scourge of the High Road, leads the Jagged Edge Goblins in pillaging caravans. Before her rise, the goblins struggled, attacking only the weakest travelers in unorganized strikes. When she killed her boss and became the band's self-proclaimed queen, everything changed.": "巴格诺特女王，公路上的祸害，带领锯齿边缘的妖精们掠夺商队。在她崛起之前，妖精们一直在挣扎，只在无组织的罢工中攻击最弱的旅行者。当她杀死她的老板并成为乐队自称的女王时，一切都改变了。",
	"The Jagged Edges dug a sprawling network of tunnels in the soft earth beneath the High Road. Secret entrances allow the goblins to make coordinated strikes and disappear before their victims can organize against them. When not planning a raid, Queen Bargnot's warriors train, rewarding the best and punishing the lazy.": "锯齿状边缘人在高路下面的软土中挖了一个庞大的隧道网络。秘密的入口使地精们能够进行协调的打击，并在受害者组织起来反对他们之前消失。在不计划突袭的时候，巴格诺特女王的战士们会进行训练，奖励优秀者，惩罚懒惰者。",
	"Queen Bargnot surrounds herself with warriors. She initially wades into battle with them, then moves back when half her hit points remain to command from safety.": "巴格诺特女王身边有很多战士。她最初与他们一起涉足战斗，然后在她的命中率还剩一半的时候，就退到安全的地方指挥。",
	"This section contains stat blocks for various goblins, along with their skitterlings and war spiders.": "本节包含了各种地精的状态块，以及他们的Skitterlings和战争蜘蛛。",
	"Prowling deserts, plains, forests, and any other sun-soaked wilderness, lightbenders are ferocious predators that have adapted to skillfully stalk prey in daylight. This monstrous creature's fur bends and refracts light from the surrounding environment, producing mirages that distract and confuse their prey—hence their name.": "在沙漠、平原、森林和任何其他被阳光浸透的荒野中游荡，lightbenders是凶猛的捕食者，它们已经适应了在白天巧妙地跟踪猎物。这种可怕的生物的皮毛会弯曲并折射周围环境的光线，产生海市蜃楼，分散和迷惑它们的猎物--这就是它们的名字。",
	"{@b {@i Hidden Hunters.}} At a distance, a lightbender looks akin to a regular lion, but closer inspection reveals their glowing eyes, iridescent mane, and pair of lashing tails spiked with refractive crystals. The lightbender's pelt magically warps light around them to disguise their movement, allowing them to teleport while leaving behind a past visual imprint. Unsuspecting prey rarely realize they're staring at an afterimage of the lightbender until the fearsome creature pounces.": "{@b {@i Hidden Hunters.}}在远处，光复者看起来就像一只普通的狮子，但仔细观察就会发现它们有一双会发光的眼睛，五彩斑斓的鬃毛，以及一对带着折射水晶的尾巴。光复者的皮毛能神奇地扭曲他们周围的光线，以掩盖他们的行动，使他们能够在留下过去的视觉印记的同时进行远程传送。毫无戒心的猎物很少意识到他们正盯着光人的残影，直到这个可怕的生物扑过来。",
	"{@b {@i Prized Manes.}} Both male and female lightbenders have the distinctive mane, which is highly prized for its light-displacing qualities and can be fashioned into a {@item mantle of the lightbender|FMprev}, though only a few mages possess the knowledge to do so.": "{@b {@i Prized Manes.}}男性和女性光复者都有独特的鬃毛，它因其遮蔽光线的特性而备受推崇，可以被塑造成一个{@item mantle of the lightbender|FMprev}，尽管只有少数法师拥有这样的知识。",
	"{@b {@i Protective Companions.}} Though lightbenders are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes cross into another lightbender's territory to help protect a newborn litter of kittens. A few people have succeeded in taming lightbenders as guards or hunting animals, and if treated well, they can make for loyal protectors, often viewing their smaller humanoid companions as surrogate kittens.": "{@b {@i Protective Companions.}}虽然光复者通常是独居动物，但它们有时会进入另一个光复者的领地，帮助保护一窝新生的小猫。有几个人成功地将光复者驯服为守卫或狩猎动物，如果对待得好，它们可以成为忠诚的保护者，经常将它们较小的人形伙伴视为代理小猫。",
	"A lightbender can become enraged in the presence of a creature wearing the {@item mantle of the lightbender|FMprev} and attack mercilessly. Lightbender companions often refuse to adventure with characters who wear such a magic item. At the GM's discretion, the mane of a lightbender companion can't be used to create a mantle, because the companion's experience living among other creatures leaves them with a smaller mane (and also to prevent adventurers from hacking their friend to pieces).": "光复者在佩戴（%0%）的生物面前会被激怒，并无情地攻击。光复者的同伴常常拒绝与佩戴这种魔法物品的角色一起冒险。根据GM的决定，光复者同伴的鬃毛不能用来制作斗篷，因为同伴在其他生物中生活的经验让他们的鬃毛比较小（也是为了防止冒险者把他们的朋友砍成碎片）。",
	"This section contains lightbender stat blocks.": "本节包含轻体人的状态块。",
	"If you're playing a beastheart and have a lightbender companion, you gain the following benefit at 9th level when you gain the beastheart's Mystic Connection feature:": "如果你扮演的是一个兽心人，并且有一个光人同伴，你在9级的时候获得兽心人的神秘连接功能，就会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b {@i Unleash Sunlight.}} As a bonus action, you cause your skin to flare with brilliant light. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your exploit save DC or become blinded for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). You can't use this benefit again until you finish a long rest.": "{@b {@i Unleash Sunlight.}} 作为一个额外动作，你使你的皮肤发出耀眼的光芒。在你10英尺范围内，你选择的每个能看到你的生物都必须在宪法规定的救赎动作上成功，否则就会失明1分钟（救赎动作在回合结束时终止）。在你完成长时间的休息之前，你不能再次使用这个技能。",
	"\"Careful, Xorannox,\" the queen's consort cautioned. \"You tread heavily.\"": "\"小心点，Xorannox，\"女王的妃子提醒道。\"你踩得很重。\"",
	"\"Tread heavily? My dear consort,\" the Tyract's grin twisted, \"I never touch the ground.\"": "\"踩得很重？我亲爱的妃子，\"Tyract的笑容扭曲了，\"我从不碰地。\"",
	"Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural Vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the aboleths, for control of the World Below.": "他们的正式名称是Vaurath（复数Vaurathi），Overminds为了控制地下世界，对他们的主要对手Synlirii和Aboleths进行阴谋和策划。",
	"{@b {@i Psionic Eyes.}} An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.": "{@b {@i Psionic Eyes.}}超感者是一个巨大的浮动大脑，有一个中央大眼睛，周围有许多较小的嵌入式眼睛。更为奇特的是，在他们的头部几英寸范围内漂浮着几只幻视眼，每只幻视眼都连接着一个小脑，可以表现出独特的幻视效果。",
	"{@b {@i Intelligent Loremasters.}} Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren't usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest.": "{@b {@i Intelligent Loremasters.}}和他们的对手一样，overminds也是智力超群的理论家。他们通常不是巫师，但他们都把收集知识和神秘科学视为最终征服的最佳工具。",
	"Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their own unshakable belief in their intellectual superiority over all others.": "过敏症患者残忍而反复无常，但却喜欢智力的测试。他们唯一的虚荣心是他们自己对自己的智力优于其他人的不可动摇的信念。",
	"{@b {@i Rivalries and Negotiations.}} Unlike their rivals, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.": "{@b {@i Rivalries and Negotiations.}}与他们的对手不同，超敏族对自己的同类有着强烈的憎恨，从不合作。然而，超敏族经常喜欢与其他物种进行外交活动，寻求形成联盟，并在整个地下世界建立秘密的特工网络。",
	"{@b {@i Smelly Eggs.}} Overmind procreation involves one aberration laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can't ignore.": "{@b {@i Smelly Eggs.}}超能力者的繁殖包括一个反常者在一个粘液池中产下一个蛋，然后把它留下来。当另一个超能力者后来检测到蛋的独特气味时，他们就向池子里喷洒他们的授精液。这些行为是由生物的必要性所迫使的，即使是超限者也不能忽视这种强迫性。",
	"Unwitting explorers sometimes accidently abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If fertilized, the explorer could find themselves as a newly hatched overmind's first victim.": "不知情的探险者有时会意外地潜入一个蛋。如果没有受精，它的携带者很可能会引起其他超限者和Synlirii的注意，他们在基因实验中使用这些蛋来创造幻觉生物。如果受精，探险者可能会发现自己成为新孵化的超能者的第一个受害者。",
	"Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.": "由于他们与生俱来的飞行能力，overminds喜欢建造（或者说，让他们的王族建造）底部附近没有任何门或入口的塔。",
	"When fighting inside their lair, an overmind can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the overmind can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the overmind can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:": "当在他们的巢穴内战斗时，一个霸主可以采取巢穴行动。在主动权计数为20时（失去主动权的平局），超能者可以采取一个巢穴行动，以造成以下效果之一；超能者不能连续两轮使用同一个巢穴行动。",
	"Viscous slime falls from the ceiling toward one creature of the overmind's choice within 120 feet of them. The creature must succeed on a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw or become vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. The effect ends when they take fire or lightning damage, or at the start of initiative count 20 of the following round.": "粘稠的粘液从天花板上落下，落向120英尺范围内的一个超能者选择的生物。该生物必须在一个{@dc 15}的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会受到火灾和雷电的伤害。当他们受到火焰或闪电伤害时，或在下一轮的主动权数20开始时，效果结束。",
	"An invisible force attempts to grab three creatures of the overmind's choice within 60 feet of them. Each creature must make a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw.

	"A hole opens in the ceiling, floor, or wall at a point the overmind chooses within 60 feet of them and belches a 20-foot-sphere of smelly gas that lasts until initiative count 20 of the following round. When a creature enters the area for the first time or starts their turn there, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the start of their next turn.": "天花板、地板或墙壁上开了一个洞，在他们60英尺范围内，由超能力者选择，并喷出一个20英尺的臭气球，持续到下一回合的行动次数20。当一个生物第一次进入这个区域或在那里开始他们的回合时，他们必须在一个{@dc 15}的宪法救赎上取得成功，否则就会被{@condition poisoned}，直到他们下一个回合开始。",

	"The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Adventurers from the Mundane World may be surprised to discover their deep allies are members of the Grasp.

They have the same enemies, after all.": "Tyract是一个战略大师，总是比他的敌人领先一步。来自世俗世界的冒险者可能会惊讶地发现他们的深度盟友是掌握者的成员。当他们遇到Xorannox时，他很高兴! 他喜欢和人形生物打交道! 毕竟，他们有相同的敌人。",
	"Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most Vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. It's just a matter of who stabs who first.": "不幸的是，无论一队英雄多么有用或可靠，肖兰诺克斯几乎无法抵制背叛盟友的冲动。他和大多数沃拉提人一样，认为所有联盟的自然结局就是背叛。这只是一个谁先刺伤谁的问题。",
	"{@b {@i Eyes Always Shielded.}} Xorannox's psionic might is so great that unlike other overminds, his floating eyes are never without their psionic shield.

	"Some creatures have a trait or action that, on a failed saving throw, imposes a debilitating effect for an extended duration. But sometimes a lucky foe can retry their saving throw and potentially end the effect early—in such situations, the stat block specifies \"save ends at start of turn\" or \"save ends at end of turn.\"": "有些生物有一种特性或行动，如果救赎失败，就会在一个较长的时间内产生衰弱的效果。但有时一个幸运的敌人可以重试他们的蓄力，并有可能提前结束效果--在这种情况下，状态块会指定 \"蓄力在回合开始时结束 \"或 \"蓄力在回合结束时结束\"。",
	"When you see this phrase, it means any creature affected by a {@b save ends effect} like this can repeat the saving throw on each of their turns, ending the effect on themself early on a success. They can only make that saving throw either at the start or end of their turn, as specified in the stat block.": "当你看到这句话时，它意味着任何受到类似（%0%）影响的生物都可以在他们的每个回合中重复投掷救生圈，一旦成功就可以提前结束对自己的影响。他们只能在他们的回合开始或结束时做这个蓄力动作，如状态块中所规定的。",
	"Here is an example of an attack with a save ends effect from the {@creature goblin cursespitter|FMprev} stat block:": "下面是一个带有拯救结束效果的攻击的例子，来自{@creature goblin cursespitter|FMprev}状态块。",
	"{@b {@i Toxic Touch.}} {@i Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:} +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. {@i Hit:} 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).": "{@b {@i Toxic Touch.}} {@i Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:} +4次命中，到达5英尺或范围30英尺，一个目标。{@i Hit:} 7 ({@damage 2d6})的毒药伤害，目标必须在{@dc 12}宪法救赎中成功，否则会被{@condition poisoned}1分钟（救赎在回合结束时终止）。",
	"Save ends effects are one way of saving space in stat blocks and making them less complex for GMs to run at the table. Much like how stat blocks just reference the poisoned condition instead of spelling its rules out each time, we didn't want to fill up the pages by repeating long sentences similar to this one: \"A target poisoned this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.\"": "拯救结束的效果是节省状态块空间的一种方式，并使其对GM来说在桌面上运行时不那么复杂。就像状态块只是参考中毒条件而不是每次都拼出它的规则一样，我们不想通过重复类似这样的长句子来填充页面。\"以这种方式中毒的目标可以在他们每个回合结束时重复投掷救命符，成功后结束对自己的影响。\"",
	"Some creatures in this book list {@b flanked} as a condition immunity. If your game uses the optional flanking rules in the core rules, then a creature with this immunity can't be flanked.": "本书中有些生物将（%0%）列为条件豁免。如果你的游戏使用核心规则中的可选包抄规则，那么具有这种免疫力的生物就不能被包抄。",
	"The core rules often use the singular pronoun \"it\" to refer to a single creature. This book instead uses \"they\" to clearly delineate between creatures and objects. Objects still use \"it\" as a singular pronoun.": "核心规则经常使用单数代词 \"它 \"来指代单个生物。本书则使用 \"它们 \"来明确划分生物和物体的界限。物体仍然使用 \"它 \"作为单数代词。",
	"The solo and leader creatures presented in this book are designed to be bosses: enemies that can take on an entire party by themselves or with a handful of underlings. Rather than simply increasing CR (an approach that often leads to underwhelming encounters), this book introduces {@b action-oriented creatures.}": "本书所介绍的独行者和首领生物被设计为老板：可以独自或与少数下属一起对付整个队伍的敌人。本书没有简单地增加CR（这种方法往往会导致令人难以接受的遭遇），而是引入了{@b action-oriented creatures.}",
	"A powerful villain needs plenty of opportunities to act and move when it's not their turn. Thus, each action-oriented creature has at least one special bonus action and reaction, as well as a special section with villain actions that let them dominate the battlefield.": "一个强大的反派需要大量的机会，在没有轮到他们的时候采取行动和移动。因此，每个以行动为导向的生物都至少有一个特殊的奖励行动和反应，还有一个特殊的部分，里面有让他们主宰战场的反派行动。",
	"These actions make the boss creatures dynamic and formidable. Whether fought as an exciting solo challenge or alongside a few easy-to-run underlings, action-oriented creatures challenge the characters with dramatic and powerful actions in combat.": "这些行动使老板生物充满活力和威力。无论是作为一个令人兴奋的单独挑战，还是与几个容易操作的下属一起战斗，以行动为导向的生物在战斗中以戏剧性和强大的行动挑战人物。",
	"Every action-oriented creature has three villain actions they can use after an enemy creature's turn. Villain actions are similar to legendary actions with the following exceptions:": "每个以行动为导向的生物都有三个反派行动，它们可以在敌方生物的回合后使用。小人行动与传奇行动类似，但有以下例外。",
	"A creature can only use one villain action per round (as such, villain actions tend to be more powerful than legendary actions).": "一个生物每回合只能使用一个反派行动（因此，反派行动往往比传奇行动更强大）。",
	"Each villain action can only be used once during a combat encounter.": "每个反派行动在一次战斗遭遇中只能使用一次。",
	"Each set of villain actions has a recommended round order. These abilities give the battle a logical flow and a cinematic arc.": "每套反派行动都有一个推荐的回合顺序。这些能力给了战斗一个逻辑的流程和一个电影般的弧线。",
	"The first villain action is an {@b opener}, which shows the characters they're not battling a typical creature. Openers generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the boss, debuff the characters, or move the creature into an advantageous position. They're just a taste of what's to come.": "第一个反派行动是一个{@b opener}，这表明角色们不是在与一个典型的生物作战。开场白通常会造成一些伤害，召唤一两个奴仆，给老板加持，给角色加持，或者把生物移到一个有利的位置。它们只是对即将到来的事情的一个尝试。",
	"The second villain action provides {@b crowd control}. It typically fires after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice, get into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it's even more powerful than an opener.": "第二个反派行动提供（%0%）。它通常是在英雄们有机会回应一次或两次，进入状态，并包围了反派之后发射的。这个第二次行动有助于反派重新获得优势。就像开局一样，这个行动也有很多种类，但它甚至比开局更强大。",
	"The third and final villain action is an {@b ultimate move or \"ult\"}—a showstopper the villain can use to deal a devastating blow to the characters before the end of the battle.": "第三个也是最后一个反派行动是一个{@b ultimate move or \"ult\"}--反派可以在战斗结束前用它来给人物以毁灭性的打击。",
	"While every creature has a recommended order of actions, you can take villain actions in any order if it makes your fight more dramatic. You could push back a villain action if a creature is stunned or might stay alive for more than three rounds, or you could perform the recommended third action in round two after several surprise critical hits!": "虽然每种生物都有一个推荐的行动顺序，但你可以按任何顺序采取反派行动，如果这能使你的战斗更有戏剧性。如果一个生物被击晕或可能活超过三回合，你可以推后一个反派行动，或者你可以在第二回合中，在几次意外的关键打击后执行推荐的第三个行动",
	"The action-oriented creatures in this book are unique. They typically have a specific name and backstory, though you can ignore these if you wish to use the creature's stat block in another way in your campaign. For instance, Queen Bargnot's stat block could be used for any action-oriented goblin in your game.": "本书中的行动型生物是独一无二的。它们通常有一个特定的名字和背景故事，不过如果你想在你的活动中以其他方式使用该生物的状态块，你可以忽略这些。例如，巴格诺特女王的状态块可以用于你游戏中的任何行动型地精。",
	"Companions are wild allies that adventure with characters. Each companion has unique traits and actions that make them a great ally. But beware! These creatures can be difficult to control in the heat of battle and just might bite the hand that feeds. Don't fret too much, though! A companion gelatinous cube or owlbear is worth the risk of an occasional wild rampage.": "同伴是与角色一起冒险的野生盟友。每个同伴都有独特的特征和行动，使他们成为一个伟大的盟友。但请注意! 这些生物在激烈的战斗中可能难以控制，而且可能会咬住喂养它们的手。不过，不要太担心! 一个伴生的胶质方块或猫头鹰熊是值得冒着偶尔狂暴的风险的。",
	"Companions are a lot of fun, but having more than one companion to manage can slow things down at the table. A companion is another member of the party, with statistics and actions to track, and additional companions can easily make combat slow to a crawl. If every player wants to get in on the companion action, it's simpler for the characters to take turns being one creature's caregiver, rather than running around adventuring with a menagerie.": "同伴是很有趣的，但如果有一个以上的同伴需要管理，就会拖慢桌面上的事情。同伴是党的另一个成员，有统计数据和行动需要跟踪，额外的同伴很容易使战斗变得缓慢。如果每个玩家都想参与同伴的行动，那么让角色们轮流做一个生物的看护人就更简单了，而不是带着一个动物群到处冒险。",
	"For characters wishing to share a companion, the companion accepts a new caregiver at the end of a short or long rest. Because a companion's proficiency bonus and hit points depend on their caregiver's level, those statistics might fluctuate if the characters in a party are different levels, reflecting that a more experienced caregiver is more adept at directing a companion.": "对于希望分享同伴的角色来说，同伴在短期或长期休息结束后会接受一个新的看护者。因为同伴的熟练度加成和命中率取决于他们的看护者的等级，如果聚会中的人物等级不同，这些数据可能会有波动，这反映出一个更有经验的看护者更善于指导同伴的情况。",
	"Every companion has a player character {@b caregiver} who commands the creature. The caregiver's player controls the companion most of the time during the game, though the GM can step in to take control if the companion and caregiver are separated, or if the caregiver mistreats the companion in some way.": "每个同伴都有一个指挥该生物的玩家角色（%0%）。在游戏中，照顾者的玩家大部分时间都控制着同伴，不过如果同伴和照顾者分开，或者照顾者以某种方式虐待同伴，GM可以介入控制。",
	"In combat, a companion shares a turn with their caregiver and acts during the caregiver's turn. A companion can move and use their own reaction and bonus action independently. But they can take only the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions unless their caregiver uses a bonus action to command the companion to take a different action, including any of the actions noted in the companion's stat block. A companion must be able to see or hear their caregiver to receive a command. A companion can also take other actions if their caregiver is incapacitated or if the companion enters a rampage (as discussed below).": "在战斗中，同伴与他们的照料者共享一个回合，并在照料者的回合中采取行动。伙伴可以独立移动并使用自己的反应和奖励动作。但他们只能采取冲刺、脱离或躲避的行动，除非他们的看护人使用奖励行动来命令同伴采取不同的行动，包括同伴状态块中提到的任何行动。伴侣必须能够看到或听到他们的看护者才能接受命令。如果看护人失去能力，或者同伴进入狂暴状态（如下文所述），同伴也可以采取其他行动。",
	"A caregiver who is {@condition charmed} can still command their companion, but they can't command the companion to attack a creature that charmed them.": "处于{@condition charmed}的看护者仍然可以指挥他们的同伴，但他们不能指挥同伴攻击迷住他们的生物。",
	"If a companion's caregiver is incapacitated or dies, the GM determines who controls the companion—typically, the caregiver's player can maintain control of their companion as they take a heroic stand against the enemy.": "如果同伴的看护者丧失能力或死亡，则由GM决定由谁来控制同伴--通常情况下，看护者的玩家可以保持对同伴的控制，因为他们对敌人采取了英勇的立场。",
	"However, in cases where a caregiver and their companion are physically separated, such as when a companion is captured, the GM might wish to take control of the companion to keep the player in suspense about the creature's fate.": "然而，在照顾者和他们的同伴实际分离的情况下，比如同伴被抓时，GM可能希望控制同伴，使玩家对生物的命运保持悬念。",
	"At the GM's discretion, a companion can abandon a caregiver character and choose a different willing creature as a caregiver.": "根据GM的决定，同伴可以放弃一个照顾者角色，选择一个不同的愿意的生物作为照顾者。",
	"Companions are dangerous creatures. Though often more docile than their wild counterparts, they aren't fully domesticated. Each companion's {@b ferocity} is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new actions, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.": "同伴是一种危险的生物。虽然通常比它们的野生伙伴更温顺，但它们并没有被完全驯化。每个同伴的{@b ferocity}是它们的韧性和愤怒的衡量标准，也是这些东西在战斗中的表现。随着同伴的凶猛程度增加，他们可以获得强大的新动作，但他们也变得更难被照顾者控制。",
	"If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by {@dice 1d4} + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the companion that they can see or hear. For the purpose of increasing ferocity, a group of creatures that share a single stat block (such as a swarm of rats) count as one creature. Ferocity increases round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain. ": "如果同伴在他们和照顾者的回合开始时没有丧失能力，他们的凶猛程度会增加（%0%）+他们能看到或听到的同伴周围5英尺内的敌对生物的数量。为了增加凶猛程度，一群共享一个属性块的生物（比如一群老鼠）算作一个生物。凶猛程度在战斗中逐轮增加，同伴可以获得的凶猛程度没有上限。",
	"After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and isn't incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a {@b rampage}. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.": "在他们的回合开始时滚动增加凶猛程度后，如果同伴的凶猛程度达到或超过10并且没有丧失能力，他们就有进入（%0%）的风险。伴侣的照顾者可以进行智慧（动物处理）检查（不需要行动），试图阻止伴侣进入狂暴状态。要进行检定，看护者必须没有丧失能力，而且伴侣必须能够看到或听到看护者的声音。检查的DC等于5+同伴的凶猛程度。成功时，同伴在他们的回合中正常行动。如果失败，或者如果看护者没有进行检查，同伴就会进入狂暴状态。",
	"When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature they can sense and attack that creature with their signature attack (see below), dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific equidistant ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).": "当同伴进入狂暴状态时，他们会立即以自己的速度向他们能感觉到的最近的生物移动，并用他们的招牌攻击（见下文）攻击该生物，如果攻击命中，会造成相当于其凶猛程度一半的额外伤害。如果至少有一个盟友和一个敌人离同伴最近且距离相等，看护者的玩家就会掷出任何骰子。如果是奇数，同伴就攻击一个盟友。如果是偶数，同伴就攻击敌人。看护者的玩家决定同伴与哪个特定的等距离盟友或敌人交战（如果他们愿意，也可以选择自己的角色）。",
	"A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature they can sense. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.": "处于狂暴状态的同伴如果无法接触到生物进行攻击，可以使用 \"冲刺 \"动作，尽可能地朝他们能感觉到的最近的生物移动。如果同伴无法感觉到任何潜在的目标，他们就会向GM决定的一个随机方向尽可能地移动，以避免危险。",
	"When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they're no longer in a rampage.": "当进入狂暴状态的同伴解决他们的行动或结束他们的回合时，他们的凶猛程度会下降到0，而且他们不再处于狂暴状态。",
	"We can already tell that some crafty players are scheming to stuff a bag full of slightly groggy rats, then open that bag up in front of your companion to build up their ferocity during a fight. However, a too-easy target doesn't rile up a companion the way being threatened by an enemy combatant in a battle for survival does. As such, the GM makes the final determination as to what constitutes a hostile creature for the purpose of increasing a companion's ferocity. Likewise, in the same way a swarm of creatures is counted as a single creature for the purpose of increasing ferocity, the GM is free to determine that two or three weak creatures might count as only one creature for that purpose.": "我们已经可以看出，一些狡猾的玩家正在谋划塞满一袋略显昏昏沉沉的老鼠，然后在你的同伴面前打开这个袋子，在战斗中培养他们的凶猛。然而，一个太容易的目标并不能像在生存之战中被敌方战斗人员威胁那样激怒同伴。因此，为了提高同伴的凶猛程度，由GM来最终决定什么是敌对的生物。同样，就提高凶猛程度而言，一群生物被算作一个生物，同样地，GM可以自由决定，两三个弱小的生物可能只算作一个生物。",
	"To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.": "为了防止伴侣进入危险的狂暴状态，照料者有几种选择可以用来减少生物的凶猛程度。",
	"Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, a companion must have a caregiver with a character level equal to or greater than the ferocity action's level, and they must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.": "每个同伴在他们的状态块中都有三个行动，使用时需要花费凶猛的力量。要使用这些凶猛行动之一，同伴必须有一个角色等级等于或高于凶猛行动等级的看护者，而且他们必须在使用行动之前花费必要的凶猛。如果同伴没有足够的猛力可以花费，他们就不能使用这个动作。",
	"Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack. Ferocity actions can't be used while a companion is in a rampage.": "凶猛行动总是使用同伴的行动，这意味着它们不能作为机会攻击的一部分来使用。当同伴处于狂暴状态时，不能使用凶猛行动。",
	"When a combat encounter involving a companion ends and the companion isn't dying, the companion regains hit points equal to their ferocity, and their ferocity drops to 0. The GM determines when a combat encounter ends, typically at the point when creatures stop acting in initiative order.": "当涉及同伴的战斗遭遇结束并且同伴没有死亡时，同伴会重新获得与他们的凶猛程度相等的命中率，并且他们的凶猛程度会降至0。GM决定战斗遭遇何时结束，通常是在生物停止主动行动的时候。",
	"When a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they're dying and make death saving throws just as characters do. Characters thus always have a chance to save their furry (or scaly, or slimy, or exoskeletony) friends' lives! If combat ends while a companion is dying, their ferocity drops to 0 but they don't regain hit points (see {@book End of Combat|FMprev|5|End of Combat} above).": "当同伴的命中率降至0时，他们就会死亡，并像角色一样进行死亡拯救。因此，角色总是有机会拯救他们的毛茸茸的（或有鳞的，或粘糊糊的，或有外骨骼的）朋友的生命 如果战斗结束时同伴正在死亡，它们的凶猛程度会下降到0，但它们不会恢复命中率（见上文（%0%））。",
	"In addition to their ferocity actions, a companion's statistics vary from the statistics of their wild counterparts. This makes a companion easier to run and keeps their power in line with other companions, even as it helps ensure companions never outshine the characters. As somewhat more social versions of wild creatures, companions are often cleverer and more versatile than their untamed counterparts.": "除了他们的凶猛行动外，同伴的统计数字也与他们的野生同行的统计数字不同。这使得同伴更容易管理，并使他们的力量与其他同伴保持一致，即使它有助于确保同伴永远不会超过角色的地位。作为野生动物的社会化版本，同伴通常比他们未被驯服的同伴更聪明、更多才多艺。",
	"Most creatures without character classes have their Hit Die type determined by their size (d4 for Tiny creatures, d6 for Small creatures, and so forth). Companions are special and use a d8 for Hit Dice regardless of size.": "大多数没有角色等级的生物的命中率类型由它们的大小决定（微小生物为d4，小型生物为d6，以此类推）。同伴是特殊的，无论大小都使用d8作为命中率。",
	"A companion shares a unique bond with their caregiver and can understand basic commands in one language chosen by the caregiver. The companion can't read, speak, or write any language, even if similar creatures normally can.": "伴侣与照料者有着独特的联系，并能理解照料者选择的一种语言的基本命令。伴侣不能读、说、写任何语言，即使类似的生物通常可以。",
	"Because a companion's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their caregiver, a companion's proficiency bonus is equal to their caregiver's proficiency bonus. Additionally, some of a companion's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a companion's proficiency bonus and are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a companion has a +2 proficiency bonus, PBd6 means 2d6.": "由于同伴的有效性和生存能力取决于其照料者的训练和专业知识，因此同伴的熟练度奖励等于其照料者的熟练度奖励。此外，同伴的一些统计数字是指他们的熟练度奖励，缩写为PB。其他统计数字使用的骰子数等于同伴的熟练度加分，并以PB代替骰子数表示。例如，如果一个同伴有+2的熟练度加成，PBd6意味着2d6。",
	"Each companion has an action designated as their {@b signature attack}. A signature attack is always a melee attack, and typically the creature's best natural attack. A companion uses their signature attack when they enter a rampage.": "每个同伴都有一个动作被指定为他们的（%0%）。标志性攻击总是一种近战攻击，通常是生物的最佳自然攻击。当同伴进入狂暴状态时，他们会使用他们的招牌攻击。",
	"Each companion also has special actions that they can use only by spending ferocity during their turn, with some of those actions making use of the companion's signature attack. See {@book Reducing Ferocity|FMprev|5|Reducing Ferocity} above for more information on ferocity actions.": "每个同伴都有特殊的行动，只有在他们的回合中花费凶猛的力量才能使用，其中一些行动使用了同伴的标志性攻击。关于凶猛行动的更多信息，见上文（%0%）。",
	"Many companions are large enough to ride, especially by caregivers who are Small, when outfitted with an exotic saddle similar to those worn by aquatic or flying mounts. When a caregiver rides a companion into combat, not much actually changes. The caregiver and companion still each act on the same turn, and the caregiver must use their bonus action to direct the companion to take any action other than the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Under some circumstances, a companion might allow themself to be ridden by a creature other than their caregiver, though that other creature can't give the companion commands.": "许多同伴都足够大，特别是由身材矮小的护理员骑着，如果装备上类似于水生或飞行坐骑所穿的异国情调的马鞍。当照顾者骑着同伴进入战斗时，实际上没有什么变化。看护者和同伴仍然在同一回合内各自行动，而且看护者必须使用他们的额外行动来指挥同伴采取除冲刺、脱离或躲避行动之外的任何行动。在某些情况下，同伴可能会允许自己被照顾者以外的生物骑乘，不过其他生物不能对同伴发出指令。",
	"If a companion bearing a rider rampages, that rider counts as being within 5 feet of the companion when determining which creature the companion attacks. If a companion attacks their rider, they have disadvantage on the attack roll.": "如果同伴带着骑手横冲直撞，在决定同伴攻击哪种生物时，骑手算作在同伴的5英尺范围内。如果同伴攻击他们的骑手，他们在攻击卷上有劣势。",
	"At the GM's discretion, characters can purchase barding for a companion, as discussed in the core rules, with the following adjustments:": "根据GM的决定，角色可以为同伴购买护身符，如核心规则中所讨论的那样，但有以下调整。",
	"Barding for Small companions weighs half as much as the equivalent armor for Humanoids. Barding for Medium companions weighs the same as Humanoid armor, while barding for Large companions weighs four times as much.": "小型同伴的护具重量是人形盔甲的一半。中型同伴的护甲与人形护甲的重量相同，而大型同伴的护甲则是其重量的四倍。",
	"Companions are proficient in any barding they wear": "伙伴们精通他们所穿的任何护具",
	"When a companion wears barding, they don't add their caregiver's proficiency bonus to their AC.": "当同伴穿上护具时，他们不会将照顾者的熟练度加成加入他们的AC。",
	"Companions who are shapechangers (such as the {@creature mimic companion|BST}) can't use that ability while wearing barding.": "身为变身者的同伴（如（%0%））在穿戴护具时不能使用该能力。",
	"Companions who have corrosive bodies or are amorphous (such as the {@creature gelatinous cube companion|BST}) can't wear nonmagical barding.": "拥有腐蚀性身体或无定形的同伴（如{@creature gelatinous cube companion|BST}）不能穿戴非魔法的护具。",
	"Unless a caregiver has the {@class beastheart|BST} class, the GM should consider a companion as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item when building encounters. A companion gives a party a significant power boost, not just by dishing out more damage and providing more hit points for enemies to target, but also by creating complications that can make a fight more challenging for the party's foes. GMs can adjust encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a companion, particularly if the characters' average level is 7th or lower.": "除非照顾者具有（%0%）等级，否则在构建遭遇战时，GM应该将同伴视为类似于一个强大的以战斗为重点的魔法物品。一个同伴能给一方带来巨大的力量提升，不仅仅是通过造成更多的伤害和为敌人提供更多的命中率，而且还通过创造复杂的情况，使一方的敌人在战斗中更具挑战性。GM可以将遭遇战的难度调整一步（从简单到中等，从困难到致命，等等），以适当地挑战一群有同伴的角色，特别是如果角色的平均等级是7级或更低。",
	"Companion creatures are designed to accompany player characters on adventures. If an NPC has a pet or creature servant, it's recommended you use the creature's normal stat block. For instance, if an NPC ranger has an owlbear they work with, that creature would use the normal {@creature owlbear} stat block and be played by the GM as normal. But if the characters are charged with rescuing a fallen druid NPC's owlbear pet from the clutches of a villain, the GM can choose to instead make that an {@creature owlbear companion|BST}, allowing the creature to join their rescuers and become part of subsequent adventures.": "陪伴生物是为了陪伴玩家角色冒险而设计的。如果一个NPC有一个宠物或生物仆人，我们建议你使用该生物的正常状态块。例如，如果一个NPC游侠有一只猫头鹰，那么这个生物将使用正常的（%0%）状态块，并由GM正常发挥。但是，如果角色们负责将一个堕落的德鲁伊NPC的猫头鹰宠物从一个恶棍的魔掌中解救出来，那么GM可以选择将其改为（%1%），让该生物加入他们的救援者，并成为后续冒险的一部分。",

	"You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature's hit points to determine effectiveness—like color spray and sleep—would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective against minions, just not devastating!": "你可能会问，为什么不直接给小兵1点命中率，并且在他们保存一半时不受伤害，就像第四版那样？首先，使用生物的命中率来决定效果的法术--如喷色和睡眠--会破坏所有的小兵，甚至那些旨在挑战高级角色的小兵。这些法术对小兵仍然有效，只是不具有破坏性而已",
	"Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save—like magic missile and spike growth—would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies. But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.": "其次，那些无需任何攻击卷或救赎就能造成伤害的法术和效果--如魔法飞弹和尖峰生长--会让只有1点命中率的小兵感到浪费。这符合挑战等级低的小兵的虚构，如地精和僵尸。但在更高的级别上，当同样的法术轻易地击倒强大的恶魔小兵时，战斗和小说的平衡就会被打破，变得近乎愚蠢。",
	"Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage—like fireball or meteor swarm—would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a \"stronger\" standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book's minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.": "最后，高级法术的救赎为一半的伤害--如火球术或流星群--在对付只有1点命中率的小兵时，会觉得是浪费。既然低级法术也可以，为什么还要使用高级法术呢？同样地，第四版的设计可能会导致一个哥布林小兵不合逻辑地从火球术中幸存下来，而他们旁边的一个 \"更强壮 \"的标准哥布林却死了，尽管这两个生物的救赎都成功了。相比之下，根据本书的小兵规则，施法者仍有充分的理由对小兵使用高级法术。",
	"Powerful weapon attacks can kill more than one minion in a single maneuver called an {@b overkill attack.}": "强大的武器攻击可以在一次操作中杀死一个以上的小兵，称为{@b overkill attack.}。",
	"As already discussed, a weapon attack requires only 1 point of damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, regardless of their hit point maximum. However, when a weapon attack's damage does exceed the target minion's hit point maximum, the attack becomes an {@b overkill attack} and the damage dealt beyond the minion's hit point maximum becomes {@b overkill damage}.": "正如已经讨论过的那样，武器攻击只需要1点伤害就可以将一个小兵的命中率降到0，不管他们的命中率上限是多少。然而，当武器攻击的伤害确实超过了目标小兵的最大命中率时，攻击会变成{@b overkill attack}，超过小兵最大命中率的伤害会变成{@b overkill damage}。",
	"Overkill damage can be applied to a second minion that has the same stat block as the target and is in overkill range (see below). Damage against the second minion is counted as if you made a weapon attack against them; since it only takes 1 point of weapon damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, any amount of overkill damage immediately knocks them out. But wait, it gets better—if the initial attack's overkill damage exceeds the second minion's hit point maximum, the leftover overkill damage can roll over to a third minion, and so on! In other words, for each time the overkill damage exceeds the new target's hit point maximum, the attacker can choose an additional minion to reduce to 0 hit points.": "过度杀伤可以应用于第二个小兵，该小兵与目标有相同的属性块，并且在过度杀伤范围内（见下文）。对第二个小兵的伤害就像你对他们进行的武器攻击一样；因为只需要1点武器伤害就可以将小兵的命中率降到0，所以任何数量的超杀伤害都会立即将他们击倒。但等等，还有更精彩的--如果初始攻击的超杀伤害超过了第二个小兵的最大命中率，剩下的超杀伤害可以滚到第三个小兵身上，以此类推 换句话说，每当超杀伤害超过新目标的最大命中率时，攻击者可以选择一个额外的小兵将其降低到0命中率。",
	"For example, when a weapon attack deals 18 damage to a minion with a hit point maximum of 5, the overkill damage is 13. If there are three additional minions of the same stat block in overkill range, they can all three be immediately reduced to 0 hit points, since the overkill damage exceeded the target's hit point maximum more than twice over.": "例如，当武器攻击对一个最大命中率为5的小兵造成18的伤害时，超杀伤害为13。如果在超杀范围内还有三个相同属性的小兵，他们都可以立即被降低到0点，因为超杀伤害超过了目标的最大命中率两倍以上。",
	"Overkill attacks can't be made as part of an opportunity attack.": "过度杀伤的攻击不能作为机会攻击的一部分来进行。",
	"Minions must be within a certain range to qualify for an overkill attack, determined by whether the attack is a melee or ranged attack.": "小兵必须在一定范围内才有资格进行超杀攻击，由攻击是近战还是远程攻击决定。",
	"When a creature hits a minion with a melee weapon attack, other minions within reach of the attack are in {@b overkill range} and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the weapon attack's reach.": "当一个生物用近战武器攻击击中一个小兵时，在攻击范围内的其他小兵会处于（%0%），并可以被选择为额外的目标，进行超杀攻击。过度杀伤的攻击不能针对武器攻击范围之外的小兵。",
	"When a creature hits a minion with a ranged weapon attack, other minions in a line originating from the creature in the direction of the target, to a distance equal to the weapon's short range, are in {@b overkill range} and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack.

	"Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.": "为群体攻击做一次攻击卷。这算作一次攻击。",
	"A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for every minion in the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll gains a +4 bonus.)": "群体攻击卷为攻击中的每个小兵获得+1的攻击卷奖励。(例如，如果四个小妖精一起进行群体攻击，攻击卷就会获得+4的奖励）。",
	"If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions that made the group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals 1 damage, their group attack deals 4 damage.)": "如果群攻命中，伤害乘以进行群攻的小兵数量。(例如，如果四个小妖精的群攻打出了1的伤害，他们的群攻就会造成4的伤害）。",
	"The GM decides how many minions participate in a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups in order to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own—they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don't benefit from any group bonuses.": "GM决定有多少个小兵参与集体攻击。例如，如果五个爪牙围着一个目标，GM可以决定让所有五个爪牙同时攻击，以加快战斗速度，也可以将攻击分成小群，以增加一些爪牙击中而其他爪牙失手的几率。单个爪牙甚至可以单独使用他们的群体攻击动作--他们像普通生物一样进行攻击，只是不受益于任何群体奖励。",
	"A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions making the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.": "只有当所有进行群攻的小兵在攻击卷上都有优势或劣势时，才会以优势或劣势进行群攻。否则，该攻击是在没有优势或劣势的情况下进行的。",
	"If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the {@spell fire shield} or {@spell hellish rebuke} spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion that was part of the attack to be affected by the effect.": "如果群体攻击触发了通常会影响单个攻击者的反应或类似效果，例如{@spell fire shield}或{@spell hellish rebuke}法术，那么群体攻击的目标会挑选一个参与攻击的小兵来受该效果的影响。",
	"If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to make a group attack as an opportunity attack.": "如果一个生物同时挑起一个以上相同属性块的小兵的机会攻击，并且这些小兵有一个近战群攻动作，那么这些小兵可以各自使用他们的反应来进行群攻，作为一个机会攻击。",
	"Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saves for each minion could slow down the action, like when a {@class cleric} surrounded by eighteen specter minions uses Turn Undead.": "虽然爪牙经常单独进行救赎，但有些时候，为每个爪牙进行单独的救赎可能会拖慢行动，比如当一个被十八个幽灵爪牙包围的（%0%）使用不死转身时。",
	"When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.": "当许多具有相同状态块的小兵需要同时对同一效果进行蓄力投掷时，你可以为一组最多五个小兵同时进行一次蓄力投掷。一组中的所有小兵都使用蓄力投掷的结果。",
	"For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a {@spell hypnotic pattern} spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.": "例如，如果三十四个地精小兵需要对一个{@spell hypnotic pattern}的法术进行蓄力，小兵们将对该法术进行总共七次蓄力：三十个小兵分成六组，每组五个人，共六次，其余四组小兵再进行一次蓄力。",
	"Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game's verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.": "具有较高挑战等级的小兵，如深渊食尸鬼或火巨人，是强大的敌人。因此，如果一个NPC平民用一次攻击就能杀死这样的小兵，就会破坏游戏的真实性。为了保持小兵的可信度，你可以使用以下规则。",
	"When a minion's challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC's challenge rating, that NPC's actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn't have the Minion trait, reducing the minion's hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.": "当一个奴才的挑战等级比一个NPC的挑战等级至少高6级时，该NPC的行动和特质会影响一个奴才，就像他们没有奴才特质一样，像普通生物一样减少奴才的命中率，而不是自动降到0。",
	"This rule shouldn't be applied to player characters—they're heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.": "这条规则不应该适用于玩家角色--他们是英雄，总是可以一击必杀的小兵。",

For example, an enemy that starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin minions must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from Tiny Stabs.": "许多小兵的特性使他们在数量上有优势，但当他们的盟友被击败时，他们的力量就会降低。例如，如果一个敌人在三个或更多的地精小兵的5英尺范围内开始他们的回合，他必须成功地进行蓄力，否则就会受到 \"小刺 \"的伤害。",
	"Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value is one-fifth that of a standard creature of the same challenge rating.

	"When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the {@spell polymorph} spell or the {@class cleric}'s Destroy Undead feature, use the minion's listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature—so this feature can affect zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not specter minions (CR 1).": "当规则提到挑战等级时，比如（%0%）的法术或（%1%）的消灭亡灵特性，就像正常情况下一样使用爪牙列出的挑战等级。例如，五级牧师可以用他们的消灭亡灵特性影响挑战等级为1/2或更低的亡灵生物，所以这个特性可以影响僵尸爪牙（CR 1/4），但不能影响幽灵爪牙（CR 1）。",

	"Unlike standard creatures, it's difficult for a group of minions to challenge characters if their challenge rating is at least 2 lower than the average party level.

	"While it's tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter.
