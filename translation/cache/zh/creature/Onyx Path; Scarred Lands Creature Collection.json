	"This encounter is designed for four characters of 1st level. You can increase the challenge for higher level characters or more party members by having more than one {@creature swarm of flesh strippers|SLCC|swarm} attack.": "这个遭遇战是为四个1级的角色设计的。你可以通过多于一次的{@creature swarm of flesh strippers|SLCC|swarm}攻击来增加对高等级角色或更多党员的挑战。",
	"The party is somewhere in the wilderness, at a campsite of their choosing. It is either late at night or early in the morning when the swarm of flesh strippers sees the resting characters and decides to attack.": "队伍在野外的某个地方，在他们选择的营地。要么是深夜，要么是清晨，这群脱衣舞娘看到了正在休息的角色并决定进行攻击。",
	"This group of {@creature swarm of flesh strippers|SLCC|flesh strippers} has been terrorizing the local area for some time now. They usually feed on smaller animals but they are bold and careful, always sending out a single rat first.": "这群{@creature swarm of flesh strippers|SLCC|flesh strippers}已经在当地恐吓了一段时间了。它们通常以小型动物为食，但它们胆大心细，总是先派出一只老鼠。",
	"It's quite likely that the encounter begins with only a single character awake (assuming that the party has set a watch). You can either have the scout attack the awake character directly (hoping to poison them) or have it sneak up—a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the watch's passive Perception score and attack a sleeping character.": "遭遇战开始时很可能只有一个角色是醒着的（假设党派已经设置了一个守卫）。你可以让侦查员直接攻击醒着的角色（希望能毒死他们），或者让它偷偷摸摸地走过来--对手表的被动感知得分进行灵巧（隐身）检查，然后攻击一个睡着的角色。",
	"If successful, the entire swarm will attack soon. The watch character will certainly notice this and then might be able to get everyone other than the victim to wake up and join the fight.": "如果成功，整个蜂群很快就会发动攻击。观察者的角色肯定会注意到这一点，然后可能会让受害者以外的所有人都醒过来，加入战斗。",
	"The flesh strippers are hungry and will continue to attack until reduced to 0 hit points, at which time any remaining rats flee, hopping away into the darkness.": "剥肉者很饿，会继续攻击，直到降低到0命中率为止，这时任何剩余的老鼠都会逃走，跳进黑暗中。",
	"Defeating a flesh stripper swarm is worth 200 XP. Characters that bother to track the rats back to their small underground lair (just a small tunnel under tree roots or a rock) can recover minor treasure equal to a total of {@dice 4d6} gp by carefully sorting through the detris of the lair.": "打败一个剥皮鼠群，价值200XP。费力追踪老鼠回到它们的地下小巢穴（只是树根或岩石下的一个小通道）的角色，可以通过仔细整理巢穴的残骸，找到相当于总价值（%0%）gp的小财宝。",
	"Four characters of 3rd level is ideal for this scenario. Increase the challenge by adding a {@creature scar twin|SLCC} that attacks another of the characters.": "四个三级的角色是这个场景的理想选择。通过增加一个攻击另一个角色的（%0%）来增加挑战。",
	"The action takes place in a restored manor house in a mostly ruined village, which could be anywhere, with any name. The NPCs will have names of the local style.": "行动发生在一个大部分被毁坏的村庄的一个修复的庄园里，这个村庄可能是任何地方，有任何名字。NPC将有当地风格的名字。",
	"Many villages were destroyed in the Titanswar and left abandoned. The Miller set up shop in such a village, restoring both the mill and a manor house for his home. Customers soon returned and he restored the rooms of his house, so that farmers could stay while he milled their grain. He prospered, hiring a Butler and Maid. But rumours remain that the village is haunted. Fortunately, the Brother of the Butler arrived a few days ago and is settling into a small house at the edge of the village. Perhaps more will come. But with good news comes bad: the Miller's Child is sick, with mysterious bruises on their body. (The Brother is a {@creature scar twin|SLCC}, but only the Butler knows this—his love for his brother clouds his judgement.)": "许多村庄在泰坦斯战争中被摧毁并被遗弃。米勒在这样的村子里开了店，修复了磨坊和一个庄园作为他的家。顾客很快就回来了，他修复了自己房子的房间，这样农民就可以在他碾磨谷物的时候留下来。他生意兴隆，雇佣了一个管家和女仆。但仍有传言说村子里闹鬼。幸运的是，管家的兄弟几天前来到这里，正在村边的小房子里安顿下来。也许会有更多的人到来。但好消息也伴随着坏消息：米勒的孩子生病了，身上有神秘的瘀伤。(弟弟是个{@creature scar twin|SLCC}，但只有管家知道这一点--他对弟弟的爱蒙蔽了他的判断。)",
	"The day is ending and the party is thinking about a campsite. Surely staying at a friendly Miller's house is more inviting than roughing it, even if the village might be haunted, right? The Miller welcomes the travellers and charges half of the normal rate (4 sp/night). After the PCs arrive, the Butler disappears for a little while—passive Perception 15 to notice this. If questioned, he will say that he took his Brother some food (which is true, but not the entire story, as the Butler begged him to target one of the PCs and stop attacking the Child).": "这一天即将结束，党员们正在考虑露营的问题。当然，住在友好的米勒家比露宿更诱人，即使村子里可能有鬼，对吗？米勒欢迎旅行者的到来，并收取正常价格的一半（4 sp/night）。在NPC到达后，管家消失了一段时间--被动感知15来注意这一点。如果被询问，他会说他给他的兄弟带了一些食物（这是事实，但不是整个故事，因为管家恳求他把目标放在一个NPC身上，并停止攻击孩子）。",
	"You can run this as an investigation or as an attack. If the characters are cautious, then an attack is simplest—the scar twin returns tonight, attempting to steal a possession from one of them. If the scar twin can steal an item from a character undetected or a compassionate healer becomes intrigued by the hurt Child, then the investigation might lead to the small single-room cottage that the Brother occupies. If the party stays at the house, they will be served a meal (included in the above cost). The Child remains in their room, sick. The Butler and Maid will retreat to a nearby cottage afterwards, returning at first light to resume their work.": "你可以以调查或攻击的方式进行。如果角色们都很谨慎，那么攻击是最简单的--疤痕双胞胎今晚回来，试图从他们中的一个人身上偷走财物。如果疤痕双胞胎能在不被发现的情况下从某个角色那里偷取物品，或者一个富有同情心的治疗师对受伤的孩子产生了兴趣，那么调查可能会导致兄弟所居住的小单间小屋的出现。如果一行人住在这所房子里，他们将得到一顿饭（包括在上述费用中）。孩子留在他们的房间里，生病了。管家和女仆事后会退到附近的小屋里，天一亮就回来继续他们的工作。",
	"This room holds foodstuffs and other household provisions.": "这个房间存放食品和其他家庭用品。",
	"This has food preparation space and leads outside to a firepit.": "这里有食物准备空间，并通向外面的火盆。",
	"Narrow stairs descend to a small cellar for excess ale and other supplies.": "狭窄的楼梯下到一个小地窖，用来存放多余的麦酒和其他用品。",
	"This has brewing equipment and fresh batches of light ale for everyone, plus a few casks of wine reserved for special guests.": "这里有酿酒设备和供大家使用的新鲜批次的淡啤酒，另外还有几桶为特殊客人保留的酒。",
	"These two open but screened doorways are the primary ventilation for the household.": "这两个开放但有屏风的门洞是家庭的主要通风口。",
	"These wide stone steps go up to the upper floors.": "这些宽大的石阶可以上到高层。",
	"The primary room of the manor house, where meals and public business are conducted. It has no upper floor and you can see the smoke-stained rafters and stone roof above.": "庄园的主要房间，是进行餐饮和公共事务的地方。它没有上层，你可以看到上面被烟熏过的椽子和石头屋顶。",
	"A low and open stone-lined trench for a fire in the colder months.": "一个低矮而开放的石槽，在寒冷的季节里可以生火。",
	"This used to be part of the manor house. Despite the name, visitors are welcome. Everyone sits on stools or benches.": "这里曾经是庄园的一部分。尽管有这个名字，但还是欢迎访客。大家都坐在凳子或长椅上。",
	"These are the private rooms of the Miller and his Wife.": "这些是米勒和他妻子的私人房间。",
	"Once a meeting room, now a lumber room.": "曾经是一个会议室，现在是一个木材室。",
	"Each of these rooms is sparsely finished with a couple of small beds, a desk and a chamber pot.": "每个房间的装修都很简陋，只有几张小床、一张书桌和一个夜壶。",
	"Few children have a separate room but there's plenty of room in this house. There is a bed, a small desk, a rug with a few wooden toys on it and a tapestry recovered from the original owners. The Child's favorite toy (a windup soldier made to resemble a Hollow Knight) is missing. The Child rests under linens, hiding bruises and welts.": "很少有孩子有独立的房间，但这所房子里有足够的空间。这里有一张床，一张小书桌，一张地毯，上面有一些木制玩具，还有一张从原主人那里收回的挂毯。孩子最喜欢的玩具（一个做得很像空心骑士的发条士兵）不见了。孩子躺在床单下，隐藏着瘀伤和伤痕。",
	"The scar twin is worth 700 XP and the GM might wish to award up to 500 XP depending on the investigation process. The Miller will pay up to 50 gp for the Child's recovery.": "疤痕双胞胎的价值是700XP，GM可能希望根据调查过程授予最多500XP。米勒将为孩子的康复支付最多50GP的费用。",
	"A group of four 5th level characters should be able to take on the {@creature charfiend|SLCC|charfiends}, though you can adjust the difficulty lower by reducing the number of monsters or up by either increasing the hit points or the total number of charfiends.": "一组4个5级的角色应该可以对付（%0%），不过你可以通过减少怪物的数量来降低难度，或者通过增加命中率或怪物的总数来提高难度。",
	"An idyllic hillock that serves as pastureland for a group of sheep, which could be in the foothills of any mountain range, especially the Kelder Mountains.": "一个田园诗般的山岗，作为一群羊的牧场，它可能在任何山脉的山脚下，尤其是凯尔德山。",
	"Loryana is a young manticora who belongs to a tribe experimenting with keeping livestock. It is just her and her sheepdog (use the mastiff entry in the core rules if needed), moving through the foothills in search of greener pastures as the winter snows retreat and expose new grass. The last two nights she has seen fires burning nearby and they seem to be getting closer. She asks the heroes for aid, hoping that they will stop long enough to help her withstand an actual attack.": "Loryana是一只年轻的尾兽，属于一个正在尝试饲养牲畜的部落。只有她和她的牧羊犬（如果需要的话，可以使用核心规则中的藏獒条目），在山脚下移动，寻找更绿的牧场，因为冬雪退去，露出了新草。在过去的两个晚上，她看到附近有火在燃烧，而且似乎越来越近。她向英雄们请求援助，希望他们能停下来，帮助她抵御真正的攻击。",
	"You can foreshadow this encounter by having the party find one or more burnt glades as they travel along whatever path is carrying them to their destination. As it gets close to evening and the players are thinking about a campsite, then you can have them see the hill, the flock of sheep and their unusual shepherdess.": "你可以预示这个遭遇，在他们沿着任何路径前往目的地的过程中，让他们找到一个或多个烧焦的小树林。在接近傍晚时分，玩家们开始考虑露营地，这时你可以让他们看到那座山，那群羊和他们不寻常的牧羊女。",
	"She will hail the group, expecting a friendly greeting unless the party is clearly composed of those who would not take kindly to a manticora. But even if they are not friendly, she will still tell them of the fires that she has seen at night and her fears for herself and her flock. She has nothing to offer (except perhaps for some mutton on the hoof, if the characters are interested) but hopefully the characters are heroes. (Or you can have the charfiends attack while negotiations are still in progress and the characters might willingly fight and argue about rewards later.)": "她会向这群人打招呼，期望得到友好的问候，除非这群人显然是由那些对尾兽不怀好意的人组成。但即使他们不友好，她也会告诉他们她在夜间看到的火光，以及她对自己和羊群的担忧。她没有什么可提供的（如果人物感兴趣，也许可以提供一些羊蹄子），但希望人物是英雄。(或者你可以在谈判还在进行的时候让charfiends发动攻击，人物可能会心甘情愿地战斗，并在以后为奖励而争论）。",
	"The fires have been set by charfiends for their own amusement and destroying the flock would entertain them greatly. There are two {@creature charfiend|SLCC|charfiends} for each hero—if you want to increase the group's tactical options then you can allow them to control the shepherdess and her dog and add another charfiend or two. They attack until at least half of them have been slain, or if they have set fire to at least a dozen creatures.": "火灾是charfiends为了自娱自乐而放的，毁掉羊群会让他们大为高兴。每个英雄有两个（%0%）--如果你想增加团体的战术选择，那么你可以让他们控制牧羊女和她的狗，再增加一两个charfiend。他们一直攻击，直到至少有一半的人被杀，或者他们至少放火烧了十几个生物。",
	"See Preparations on page 214 if you wish to allow the party enough time to do a series of montage actions to defend the hill.": "如果你希望让党有足够的时间做一系列蒙太奇行动来保卫山头，请参见第214页的准备工作。",
	"These are some tumbledown ruins that shepherds or other travellers sometimes use as shelter. There's nothing of value here, other than having a sturdy wall at your back.": "这些是一些坍塌的废墟，牧羊人或其他旅行者有时会将其作为庇护所。除了在你的背后有一堵结实的墙之外，这里没有任何有价值的东西。",
	"This is where the flock beds down for the night. The area is considered difficult terrain, as the characters must maneuver through the sheep.": "这里是羊群过夜的地方。这个区域被认为是困难的地形，因为角色必须在羊群中穿梭。",
	"This is the location where the {@creature charfiend|SLCC|charfiends} will emerge. The tangled trees and roots mean difficult terrain and the tree trunks themselves provide half cover for anyone inside the treeline.": "这是{@creature charfiend|SLCC|charfiends}将出现的位置。纠结的树木和树根意味着困难的地形，树干本身为树线内的人提供了一半的掩护。",
	"This is the least steep way up the hill, and was used by the sheep and will likely be used by the charfiends as well.": "这是最不陡峭的上山方式，是羊群使用的，很可能也会被炭火人使用。",
	"All of the charfiends are worth 1,600 XP total. Loryana cannot offer any money as payment, but is willing to give the party one or more sheep (up to one sheep per hero at maximum), each of which is worth 1-2 gold pieces at market.": "所有的charfiends总共价值1,600 XP。洛里亚纳不能提供任何金钱作为报酬，但愿意给党派一只或多只羊（每个英雄最多一只羊），每只羊在市场上价值1-2金币。",
	"A group of four 7th level characters will find dealing with the {@creature coal goblin|SLCC|coal goblins} and the {@creature forge wight|SLCC} a reasonable challenge. You can increase the difficulty of the scenario by increasing the number of {@creature coal goblin|SLCC|goblins} or their tenacity, and you can reduce it by making them flee earlier or by having fewer.": "一组4个7级的角色会发现对付（%0%）和（%1%）是一个合理的挑战。你可以通过增加{@creature coal goblin|SLCC|goblins}的数量或他们的韧性来增加该场景的难度，你也可以通过让他们提前逃离或减少数量来降低难度。",
	"This is an underground location, probably originally built by dwarves. It could fit into a larger complex by being substituted in for a dead end somewhere, or it might be possible that the area A hallway leads to the entrance and the H area leads to a natural chimney or other tunnel.": "这是一个地下场所，可能最初由矮人建造。它可以通过替代某处的死胡同而融入一个更大的建筑群，也有可能A区的走廊通向入口，H区通向一个天然烟囱或其他隧道。",
	"Long ago, this was a natural cave, with a chasm separating the two areas. For whatever reason (perhaps due to presence of natural chimney passages or because of the ore exposed by the chasm) someone built the forge complex and contrived the column and platform to allow them to safely cross the gap without making it easy for attackers to do so.": "很久以前，这里是一个天然洞穴，有一条鸿沟将两个区域分开。不管出于什么原因（也许是由于存在天然的烟囱通道，或者是由于鸿沟暴露出的矿石），有人建造了锻造综合体，并设计了柱子和平台，使他们能够安全地跨越鸿沟，而又不至于让攻击者轻易得逞。",
	"Each square on the map is 5 feet, and the ceilings are 10 feet tall and made of stone.": "地图上的每个方块都是5英尺，天花板是10英尺高，由石头制成。",
	"This 10-foot wide tunnel leads either to an unremarkable entrance or another part of a larger complex. It is how the party reaches this area.": "这条10英尺宽的隧道要么通向一个不起眼的入口，要么通向一个更大建筑群的另一部分。这是党到达这个区域的方式。",
	"The opening is, on average, around 25 or 30 feet wide. The edge is treacherous, but there are some iron hooks (and possibly even some lengths of rope) set in the stone that were once used to quarry the walls.": "洞口平均约为25或30英尺宽。边缘很危险，但有一些铁钩（甚至可能有一些绳子的长度）镶嵌在石头上，曾经用来开采墙壁。",
	"This is a smooth column of stone that extends from the top of the ceiling 20 feet above and down to the bottom of the chasm, about 150 feet below. At the level where the forge is built there are deep grooves in which the platform travels. It is counter-balanced so that there is a thick center area and thinner platform. In order to reach the other edge of the chasm, the party will need to somehow cause the platform to swing to their side and then swing it back to the other side. Moving the platform initially will probably require ropes and grappling hooks. Once standing on the platform, one or more characters can grab the stone column and use it to pull themselves so that the platform swings to the other side. Doing this alerts the goblins in area E.": "这是一根光滑的石柱，从20英尺高的天花板顶部一直延伸到鸿沟底部，大约150英尺以下。在建造锻造厂的那一层，有深槽，平台在其中行走。它是反平衡的，因此有一个厚的中心区域和较薄的平台。为了到达鸿沟的另一边缘，当事人需要以某种方式使平台向他们这边摆动，然后再把它摆回另一边。最初移动平台可能需要绳索和抓钩。一旦站在平台上，一个或多个角色可以抓住石柱，用它来拉自己，使平台荡到另一边。这样做会惊动E区的地精。",
	"This is another tunnel that is very similar to the one on the other side of the chasm. However, after about 15 feet it ends in rubble, where the tunnel has been collapsed (the coal goblins intentionally did this to prevent other creatures in the larger complex from using this passage).": "这是另一条隧道，与鸿沟另一侧的隧道非常相似。然而，在大约15英尺之后，它在瓦砾中结束，那里的隧道已经坍塌（煤妖精故意这样做，以防止更大的建筑群中的其他生物使用这个通道）。",
	"There are three {@creature coal goblin|SLCC|Coal Goblins} here, supposedly on watch, but mostly amusing themselves in this room that is full of junk that they've scavenged from elsewhere. They automatically hear any movement of the stone platform in Area C but other attempts to sneak up on them use their passive Perception of 14. If the party is using the platform, they will take potshots at them with their shortbows and then retreat to Area F and wait to ambush the characters there.": "这里有三个（%0%），据说是在放哨，但大多是在这个房间里自娱自乐，这个房间里到处都是他们从其他地方搜刮来的废品。他们会自动听到C区石台的任何动静，但其他试图偷袭他们的行为会使用他们被动的14级感知力。如果一行人在使用石台，他们会用短弓向他们射击，然后撤退到F区，等待在那里伏击人物。",
	"This is where the Coal Goblins reside, only venturing to the forge itself to collect water and crossing the chasm to go raiding. If the goblins from Area E have warned of the party's approach, all surviving goblins will hide at the entrance to Area G, hoping to surprise the characters with their nets and gain the upper hand.": "这里是煤精们居住的地方，他们只在锻造厂本身取水和越过鸿沟去突袭时才会冒险。如果E区的哥布林警告过队伍的接近，所有幸存的哥布林都会躲在G区的入口处，希望能用他们的网给角色们一个惊喜，并占得先机。",
	"This tunnel leads from the room that the Coal Goblins use as a living area and wraps around to the forge area. It is interrupted by the rubble from the collapsed tunnel in Area H, but the goblins have dug out enough that any Medium character can squeeze through the gap to reach the forge.": "这条隧道从煤精们用作生活区的房间开始，一直延伸到锻造区。它被H区倒塌的隧道中的碎石打断，但地精们已经挖出了足够的空间，任何一个中型角色都可以挤过这个缺口到达锻造区。",
	"The stone here is from the ceiling that the goblins intentionally collapsed. There's enough of a gap to reach the forge. If the goblins were forced to flee the characters, they might have also squeezed through smaller gaps and headed into the tunnel heading north, the contents of which are up to you to work out.": "这里的石头是来自地精们故意弄塌的天花板。这里有足够的缝隙可以到达锻造台。如果地精们被迫逃离这些人物，他们可能也会挤过更小的缝隙，进入向北的隧道，其中的内容就看你怎么去解决了。",
	"This large room is dominated by three things—a large but well-rusted anvil, a pool of water that is fed from a constant drip from above (the water is fresh, but with a somewhat unpleasant taste of stone and chemicals) and a forge that at first appears entirely dead. However, if the characters investigate either the anvil or the forge then the {@creature Forge Wight|SLCC} will appear and attack. A GM may decide to place a magical item or other treasure here, but the goblins have been here many times and it is not likely that much useful stuff remains.": "这个大房间里有三样东西--一个巨大但锈迹斑斑的铁砧、一池从上面不断滴下的水（水很新鲜，但有一点令人不快的石头和化学品的味道）和一个起初看起来完全死气沉沉的锻造厂。然而，如果人物调查铁砧或锻造厂，那么（%0%）会出现并攻击。GM可以决定在这里放置一件魔法物品或其他宝物，但地精已经来过这里很多次了，不可能有太多有用的东西留下来。",
	"Defeating all of the Coal Goblins is worth 2,250 XP and the Forge Wight offers 200 more XP. Rummaging through the goblins' belongings can scrounge up 2d20 silver pieces for each character. As discussed above, a generous GM could allow a magical item to be discovered, especially if the Forge Wight is slain outright.": "打败所有的煤炭妖精可以获得2250XP，而锻造之翼可以再提供200XP。翻找地精的物品可以为每个角色搜罗到2D20个银币。如上所述，一个慷慨的GM可以允许发现一件神奇的物品，特别是在锻造之神被直接杀死的情况下。",
	"A group of four characters of about 9th level should be able to investigate the temple. For lower level groups, do not have the obelisk fire {@spell lightning bolt||lightning bolts}, reduce the Thunder Orbs to one, and/or remove the Dunefish. For higher-level groups, add another {@creature Dunefish Swarm|SLCC} to the sandpit, and/or allow the obelisk to cast {@spell chain lightning} instead.": "一组4个大约9级的人物应该可以调查这个寺庙。对于低级别的团体，不要让方尖碑发射（%0%），将雷霆球减少到一个，和/或移除Dunefish。对于高等级的团体，在沙坑上再加一个{@creature Dunefish Swarm|SLCC}，和/或让方尖碑施放{@spell chain lightning}。",
	"The Temple of the Stars was built by the Asaatthi long, long ago, in a climate hospitable to the serpent-folk. But the Titanswar ravaged the entire world and now the Temple can be found in a desert-like environment, perhaps the Ukrudan Desert or the Bleak Savannah or the Desert of Onn.": "星辰神殿是由阿萨提人在很久很久以前建造的，当时的气候对蛇人很友好。但泰坦斯战争蹂躏了整个世界，现在可以在类似沙漠的环境中找到神庙，也许是乌克鲁丹沙漠或荒凉的大草原或奥恩的沙漠。",
	"Long ago, the Asaatthi built a complex of temples that tracked the movements of the stars and moons in order to keep track of the complex calendar that is now known as Serpentreckoning. The temples were to be visited on specific days: defences kept away thieves from the temple the rest of the year. Now, with the world changed, the Visiting Day for this Temple will never come again. Due to the temple's defenses, a swarm of dunefish have taken up residence in the soft sand that fills what used to be the sacred pool of the temple. They feed on anything foolish enough to get too close to the temple.": "很久以前，Asaatthi人建立了一个寺庙群，追踪星星和月亮的运动，以记录复杂的日历，也就是现在的蛇形图。寺庙要在特定的日子里被访问：防御措施使盗贼在一年的其他时间里无法进入寺庙。现在，随着世界的改变，这个寺庙的拜访日将永远不会再来了。由于寺庙的防御措施，成群结队的土鱼已经在柔软的沙地上住了下来，这些沙地填满了曾经是寺庙的圣池。它们以任何愚蠢到离寺庙太近的东西为食。",
	"From a distance, the party can see the broken columns and some of the stone lintels that lay half-buried in the sand-dunes around the ruins. The desert heat makes the scene hazy, and the central obelisk looks just like another broken column at this distance.": "从远处看，一行人可以看到断裂的柱子和一些半埋在废墟周围沙丘中的石质门楣。沙漠的热度使场景变得朦胧，中央的方尖碑在这个距离上看起来就像另一根断裂的柱子。",
	"When the PCs get closer, use the map to describe the various areas:": "当NPC走近时，用地图来描述各个区域。",
	"These columns once supported the temple structure. Some of them are still standing, at least partially. Other pieces of rubble are buried in the sand nearby. A character that spends some time examining the architecture and succeeds at a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check will recognize the temple as Asaatthi.": "这些柱子曾经支撑着寺庙的结构。它们中的一些仍然矗立着，至少是部分。其他瓦砾则被埋在附近的沙子里。花一些时间检查建筑并成功通过DC10智力（历史）检查的人物会认出这个寺庙是阿萨提。",
	"Once these wide, shallow steps led visitors to the temple to the sacred pool, where they could engage in rituals on a Visiting Day. Sand now covers many of the steps.": "曾经，这些宽而浅的台阶将游客引向寺庙的圣池，在探访日可以在那里进行祭祀活动。现在沙子覆盖了许多台阶。",
	"This used to be filled with clear water, but it is now filled with loose sand. A character looking at the space can make a DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check to notice the ripples typical of a {@creature Dunefish Swarm|SLCC}. Otherwise, a PC that spends a minute or more observing the pool can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, spying a Dunefish on a success. If a character enters the sacred pool, the soft sand is difficult terrain and the Dunefish Swarm attacks the next round.": "这里曾经充满了清澈的水，但现在却充满了松散的沙子。观察这个空间的人物可以进行DC18智慧（生存）检查，以注意到（%0%）的典型涟漪。否则，一个花了一分钟或更多时间观察水池的人物可以进行DC13智慧（感知）检查，在成功后窥探到一条Dunefish。如果一个角色进入圣池，柔软的沙地就是困难的地形，Dunefish群在下一轮攻击。",
	"Positioned in the center of the sacred pool, the four-sided obelisk seems to be the only part of the temple that has survived intact. On two sides of the obelisk, about half-way up, are black bulges several feet in diameter. These are the Thunder Orbs, which stay in their recesses until someone enters the sacred pool.": "四面方尖碑位于圣池的中央，似乎是神庙中唯一完整保存下来的部分。在方尖碑的两边，大约一半的位置，有直径数英尺的黑色凸起。这些是雷球，在有人进入圣池之前，它们一直呆在凹陷处。",
	"At the top of the obelisk is a pyramid shaped capstone covered with carvings. The capstone is a series of smaller assemblies, and their configuration determines the temple's Visiting Day. A character within 5 feet of the capstone can spend an action to study it, making a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check. Asaatthi have advantage on this check. On a success, a character can spend four rounds to reconfigure it to make today the Visiting Day. On a failure, the PC must try random combinations and it takes eight rounds. Otherwise, if a creature is within 30 feet of the obelisk, its defense system activates and the Thunder Orbs are released. On initiative count 20, losing all ties, roll 1d20 for the obelisk's lair action. On a 20, the obelisk casts {@spell lightning bolt}, targeting the nearest creature. On a 1, the obelisk casts {@spell lightning bolt}, targeting the farthest creature within range of the spell.": "方尖碑的顶端是一个金字塔形的顶石，上面布满了雕刻。顶石是一系列较小的集合体，它们的配置决定了神庙的探视日。一个在顶石5英尺范围内的人物可以花一个行动来研究它，做一个DC15智力（奥术或历史）检查。Asaatthi在这个检查中具有优势。如果成功，角色可以花四轮时间来重新配置它，使今天成为探访日。失败时，角色必须尝试随机组合，并且需要八轮时间。否则，如果有生物在方尖碑的30英尺范围内，它的防御系统就会启动，雷霆球就会释放。在主动权计数20时，失去所有的平局，为方尖碑的巢穴行动掷1d20。20时，方尖碑施放（%0%），目标是最近的生物。1时，方尖碑施放{@spell lightning bolt}，目标是咒语范围内最远的生物。",
	"The entire encounter is worth 4,500 XP. At the base of the obelisk characters might find a hidden compartment with offerings to the temple, such as a book of knowledge, a fangstooth weapon, moltleather armor, or a serpent fang.": "整个遭遇战的价值是4500XP。在方尖碑的底部，人物可能会发现一个隐藏的隔间，里面有给神庙的供品，比如一本知识书、一把獠牙武器、摩尔塔瑟盔甲或一把蛇形獠牙。",
	"This encounter works for a group of four characters of 13th level, though a well-prepared lower level group could complete the challenge. Adding {@creature mill slug|SLCC|mill slugs} increases the challenge.": "这个奇遇适用于4个13级的角色组，不过准备充分的低级组也可以完成挑战。加入{@creature mill slug|SLCC|mill slugs}会增加挑战的难度。",
	"The setting for this encounter is the little village of Turner's Ferry, which can fit alongside any river or stream.": "这次相遇的背景是特纳渡口的小村庄，它可以适合在任何河流或小溪旁。",

	"The trolls will attempt to charge the characters on the bridge, in order to constrain their abilities and hopefully break through to the road beyond.

	"Once the enemy is identified, the party might join the trolls on their hunt or simply allow them to pass. If the PCs join them then you will want to prepare some sort of stronghold and a place where the warhorses are being kept.

	"Acid shamblers lash out, without hesitation or desire for survival, at all living creatures they encounter. Driven by pain and hatred of what they have become, these creatures are mindless killers, and the fact that they often travel in packs makes them exceedingly dangerous to unprepared or ill-equipped opponents.

An Amalthean buck guards every doe, and both, having been raised on a diet of Amalthean milk, are stronger and more resilient than mundane animals.": "这些不寻常的生物被追捧的原因只有一个：Amalthean nan的乳汁具有难以置信的治疗能力，因其能够治疗疾病、否定毒药和治愈伤口而闻名。许多人都觊觎这种牛奶，尤其是那些无法获得神职人员的神力的人--但困难在于如何获得这种牛奶。一只Amalthean公鹿守护着每一只母鹿，而这两只母鹿都是以Amalthean牛奶为食，比普通的动物更强壮，更有韧性。",
	"Amalthean goats goats typically live with just their mate, and any young they might have. Their remarkable resilience means they don't need a herd to protect them from predators.": "Amalthean山羊通常只和它们的配偶以及它们可能拥有的任何幼崽一起生活。它们非凡的复原力意味着它们不需要一个群体来保护它们免受捕食者的伤害。",
	"Although Amalthean bucks are too aggressive to domesticate, the nans are (very) occasionally tamed by a village or tribe. For fear of theft, these prized animals are usually well-kept secrets. However, solitary goats seem to have greatly reduced lifespans, and of course cannot reproduce, so eventually the village will need to acquire a new kid.

	"Although of low intelligence, Amalthean goats are canny in their use of the cliffs and other precipices of their preferred habitat. In combat they will use their powerful charge to push enemies off ledges or into ravines, buying themselves time to escape, and will willingly provoke opportunity attacks in order to do so. The Amalthean doe fights only to defend herself and her kids from aggression, but the buck is quite belligerent and will generally charge anyone within range. However he is protective, not malicious, and if intruders retreat he is usually content to let them go.": "虽然智力低下，但阿玛尔山羊在利用它们喜欢的栖息地的悬崖和其他悬崖方面很狡猾。在战斗中，它们会利用强大的冲力将敌人推下壁架或推入峡谷，为自己争取逃跑的时间，并会心甘情愿地挑起机会攻击，以便做到这一点。Amalthean母鹿的战斗只是为了保护自己和她的孩子不受侵犯，但公鹿相当好战，一般会向范围内的任何人冲锋。然而，它是保护性的，不是恶意的，如果入侵者撤退，它通常会满足于让他们离开。",

	"A scourge to all, these undead are blamed by the divine on Chern, whereas titanspawn tend to point their fingers at Belsameth or Vangal. They roam deserts and blighted wastelands, sometimes carried along by sandstorms, hunting all living creatures regardless of race or allegiance.

It attacks either by enveloping a victim, burning and suffocating it to death, or by lashing out with hot tendrils of fiery ash.": "作为所有人的祸害，这些亡灵被神灵指责为彻恩，而泰坦精灵则倾向于将矛头指向贝尔萨梅斯或范加尔。他们在沙漠和枯萎的荒地上游荡，有时被沙尘暴带走，猎杀所有生物，不分种族或效忠。灰云的物理形态似乎是由热的、燃烧的灰烬组成的，因此它几乎是无坚不摧的伤害。它的攻击方式是将受害者包裹起来，使其燃烧并窒息而死，或者用火热的灰烬卷轴进行攻击。",
	"The most frightening aspect of the ashcloud is its horrifying ability to incinerate and feed upon the souls of its victims, leaving behind nothing but wisps of ash. A creature killed this way can not be brought back to life with anything but the most powerful of magic.": "灰云最可怕的地方在于它有焚烧和吸食受害者灵魂的可怕能力，只留下一缕灰。以这种方式杀死的生物，除了最强大的魔法外，是无法复活的。",
	"The ashcloud exists to consume the living, and will relentlessly pursue quarry, trying to engulf the slowest of them, however it is intelligent enough to use its flyby to harass more powerful foes, or to flee through narrow gaps if its own existence is threatened. It will often inhabit ruins where it can trap creatures in enclosed spaces. Once it renders a target unconscious it will often remain in place to kill and consume the victim.": "灰云的存在是为了吞噬活人，它会无情地追捕猎物，试图吞噬最慢的猎物，然而它足够聪明，可以利用它的飞翔来骚扰更强大的敌人，或者在自己的生存受到威胁时通过狭窄的缝隙逃离。它经常会居住在废墟中，在那里它可以把生物困在封闭的空间里。一旦它使目标失去意识，它往往会留在原地杀死并吞噬受害者。",

It can sting four times before needing to be refilled.": "看门人的毒药库可以装入任何一种它的主人愿意使用的、有能力获得的毒药，但默认情况下，它的毒刺攻击中描述的是丧失能力的毒药（见下文）。在需要重新填充之前，它可以刺痛四次。",
	"When the miniscule lockwatcher occupies another creature's space it will try to climb onto that \"host\". Attack rolls made against such a lockwatcher must also be compared to the host creature, possibly hitting both, although attackers can choose to roll with disadvantage in order to target only the lockwatcher.

	"One of the more unsettling aspects of the Asuran lockwatcher is its tendency to run up the arm or leg of a creature it is attacking, and sometimes even into sleeves or pant legs or inside armor, where it lurks, stinging and re-stinging its host at any sign of activity while it waits for its master to capture the thief.": "阿苏拉守望者的一个更令人不安的方面是它倾向于沿着它正在攻击的生物的手臂或腿跑，有时甚至跑进袖子或裤腿或盔甲里面，在那里它潜伏着，在任何活动的迹象下刺痛和重新刺痛它的主人，同时它等待它的主人来捕获小偷。",
	"Usually found in the locks in which they are placed, the lockwatcher will remain dormant indefinitely, waking up at the first indication that the lock is being manipulated with an object other than the proper key.

	"The bat devils are rather inaccurately named; this sentient race of bat-people suffers from a bad, yet unearned reputation. One of the few humanoid races naturally capable of flight, bat devils stand around six feet tall when fully upright.

	"Bat devils typically eat monstrous insects and birds, which they catch on the wing, but they have been known to augment their diet by carrying off young herd animals. As they see little difference between a rancher's herd and wild prey, their occasional predations only add to their reputation among men. Worse, due to the actions of a few rogue (and likely insane) individuals, bat devils are rumored to snatch away and eat unattended children, even though the average bat devil is no more likely to steal a child than is the average man.": "蝙蝠魔通常吃畸形的昆虫和鸟类，它们在翅膀上捕捉这些东西，但它们也知道通过携带年轻的畜群来增加它们的食物。由于它们认为牧场主的畜群和野生猎物之间没有什么区别，它们偶尔的捕食行为只会增加它们在人类中的声誉。更糟的是，由于一些无赖（很可能是疯子）的行为，蝙蝠魔鬼被传言会抢走并吃掉无人看管的孩子，尽管一般的蝙蝠魔鬼并不比一般人更有可能偷窃孩子。",
	"Bat devils have a relatively simple society, due to their lack of reliance on material goods. They tend to gather in roosts, led by the wisest female.

The wasps are dormant in the winter, emerging from burrows in the earth early in the spring to travel through the forests and grasslands, looking for creatures in which to lay their eggs.": "狂蜂不筑巢，而是利用大型动物作为其卵的活体宿主。黄蜂在冬季处于休眠状态，在春季早期从地洞中出来，在森林和草原上旅行，寻找可以产卵的生物。",
	"Berserker wasps are drawn to the scent of blood, and their sensitive olfactory bulbs can sense a wounded person or animal at surprising distances.

After the eggs hatch the young feed on the host body, then fly off, leaving nothing but a skeleton.": "狂蜂被血腥味所吸引，它们敏感的嗅球可以在令人惊讶的距离内感知受伤的人或动物。当发现一个受害者时，蜂群将其包围，反复叮咬以保持其麻痹状态。然后蜂后钻进仍然温暖的身体里产卵。卵孵化后，幼虫以宿主的身体为食，然后飞走，只留下一副骨架。",

	"Berserker wasps are drawn to the smell of blood, so the first scouts will often arrive during or at the end of combats, and if food is found they quickly summon the swarms.

As long as berserker wasps have a target, uninjured creatures that do not attack berserker wasps will generally be ignored.": "狂蜂被血腥味所吸引，因此第一批侦察兵往往会在战斗中或战斗结束时到达，如果发现食物，它们会迅速召唤蜂群。蜂群会攻击受伤的目标，会不断攻击被它麻痹的目标，一旦目标死亡就会进食，但会立即转向任何攻击它的生物。只要狂暴黄蜂有一个目标，没有攻击狂暴黄蜂的未受伤的生物一般会被忽略。",

Despite their own foul odor, charfiends can seemingly smell burning flesh for miles. These creatures tend to lair in old ruins and burnt-out structures, emerging often to feed.

Once its Lightning Burst ability is exhausted, a cloudsting normally soars up out of range and flies off, perhaps returning later if it thinks it might still win some golden prize.": "云雀倾向于完全避免战斗，更喜欢从高空监视猎物；它们在远处跟随，等待合适的机会带着任何金币或物品潜逃。云雀只有在被逼无奈的情况下才会参与近战，用它的触手和风爆来对付较小或不太危险的敌人，或者用闪电爆来对付它认为是严重威胁的生物。一旦它的 \"闪电爆发 \"能力耗尽，云雀通常会飞出范围，然后飞走，如果它认为它可能还会赢得一些金色的奖品，也许会在晚些时候回来。",

	"Created as living siege weapons, wrack dragons were created to serve their masters, the titans, as officers and warriors in the Divine War. Few wrack dragons survived the war or the concerted cleansing operations the gods staged afterward. However, those that did survive are generally the craftiest, if not the mightiest, of their kind, and some still lead the remnants of the forces they once commanded (or their descendants).": "作为活生生的攻城武器，缠绕龙被创造出来为它们的主人泰坦服务，作为神战中的军官和战士。很少有蛇龙能在战争中或诸神之后的联合清洗行动中幸存下来。然而，那些幸存下来的人即使不是最强大的，也通常是最聪明的，而且有些人仍然领导着他们曾经指挥的残余部队（或他们的后代）。",
	"Wrack dragons are clever and malicious, and some also have a natural aptitude for magic. All are formed from elemental wrack—natural elements exposed to harmful energies and imbued with a destructive spiritual resonance. The titans amplified and shaped this energy into great, lithe beasts of war. Thus wrack dragons are more than mere elementals; they are actually dragons, yet they share many elemental traits.": "裂缝龙聪明而恶毒，有些还具有天然的魔法天赋。所有这些龙都是由元素缠绕形成的--自然元素暴露在有害的能量中，并被赋予了破坏性的精神共鸣。泰坦们将这种能量放大并塑造成伟大的、轻盈的战争野兽。因此，缠绕龙不仅仅是单纯的元素，它们实际上是龙，但它们拥有许多元素的特征。",
	"Each wrack dragon is unique. Some weaker and some more powerful specimens exist, and certain individuals may have spellcasting or other unique abilities to set them apart from others of their kind. Wrack dragons do not age like true dragons, nor are they mortal creatures at all. They do not need to eat, drink, or sleep. They seek only to unleash devastation into the world around them, fueling their existences with the very wrack with which they were created.": "每条蛇龙都是独一无二的。一些较弱和一些较强的标本存在，某些个体可能具有法术或其他独特的能力，使他们与其他同类不同。裂缝龙不像真正的龙那样衰老，它们也根本不是凡人的生物。它们不需要吃、喝或睡觉。它们只寻求向周围的世界释放破坏力，用它们被创造出来的裂缝为它们的存在提供动力。",
	"Wrack dragons are as much forces of nature as they are living creatures; they do not mate and cannot reproduce. Wrack dragons are thus an ever-diminishing breed, for they were never truly born, and barring the return of their creators, there will likely be no more of them. In a sense, then, wrack dragons are already dead.": "裂缝龙是自然界的力量，就像它们是生物一样；它们不交配，不能繁殖。因此，裂缝龙是一个不断减少的品种，因为它们从未真正出生过，除非它们的创造者回来，否则可能不会再有。因此，从某种意义上说，裂腹龙已经死了。",
	"Those wrack dragons that survived the Titanswar tend to live a quiet, isolated existence, keeping their heads down as it were, and instead working discreetly through servants and intermediaries. Those wrack dragons that remain are individuals of many minds. Some, particularly those created near the end of the Titanswar, are bitter, solitary, brooding things, angry at having been left to the mercy of hostile gods. They live a furtive existence in the dark places of the world. Still, most surviving wrack dragons remain loyal to their creators even now, working diligently with other loyal titanspawn to rescue and restore their titanic lords.": "那些在泰坦斯战争中幸存下来的蛇龙往往过着安静、孤立的生活，低调行事，而是通过仆人和中间人谨慎地工作。那些留下来的蛇龙是具有多种思想的个体。有些人，特别是那些在泰坦斯战争末期创造出来的，是痛苦、孤独、忧郁的东西，对自己被敌对的神灵抛弃而感到愤怒。他们在世界的黑暗处过着偷偷摸摸的生活。不过，大多数幸存的缠绕龙直到现在仍然忠于它们的创造者，与其他忠诚的泰坦精灵一起努力工作，拯救和恢复它们的泰坦之主。",
	"There are numerous sorts of wrack dragons. The four best-known varieties are listed here.": "有许多种类的缠绕龙。这里列出了四个最著名的品种。",
	"The first wrack dragons made by the titans were formed from sea wrack, the debris of the ever-churning ocean imbued with a terrible primal hate. Caustic, hateful beasts, these creatures served as the aquatic scouts of the titans.": "泰坦巨人制造的第一批缠绕龙是由海中的缠绕物形成的，这些不断翻滚的海洋的碎片被灌注了可怕的原始仇恨。这些生物是腐蚀性的、可憎的野兽，它们是泰坦的水生侦察兵。",
	"Next, dragons were formed from fire wrack: embers, ash, burnt bones, and the essence of flame and the destructive power of the unchecked forest fire. These mighty creatures were made the officers and elite champions of the titan armies.": "接下来，龙是由火包形成的：余烬、灰烬、烧焦的骨头、火焰的精华和不受控制的森林火灾的破坏力。这些强大的生物被制成泰坦军队的军官和精英冠军。",
	"Following the firewracks, the titans made wrack dragons from the bitter cold winds of the northern and southern regions, the crushing ice of ancient glaciers and icebergs. These dragons are monstrous conglomerations of ice, snow, biting winds, frozen blood, and the despair brought on by the relentless cold of the deepest winters. While they are not as magically gifted as the stormwracks, icewrack dragons have some skill with illusions and cold magic.": "继火龙之后，泰坦们用北方和南方地区的严寒之风、古代冰川和冰山的碎冰制造了缠绕龙。这些龙是冰、雪、刺骨的风、冰冻的血以及最深的冬天的无情寒冷所带来的绝望的畸形集合体。虽然它们没有风暴龙那样的魔法天赋，但冰裂龙对幻术和冷魔法有一定的技巧。",
	"The titans finally settled on the most potent wrack yet, storm wrack, the stuff of tempests and typhoons, the captured and polluted essence of tornadoes and thunder-storms breaking over the land. These dragons are made of bleached and storm-cracked tree limbs, of animals drowned in flash-floods and wind-bent trees split by lightning. These powerful creatures—often misleadingly called \"woodwrack dragons\" because of the cracked and splintered wood that makes up much of their physical form—were the magicians, assassins, and advisors to the commanders of the titans.": "巨头们最终选择了最有力的包装，即风暴包装，暴风雨和台风的东西，龙卷风和雷暴的捕获和污染的精华在土地上破裂。这些龙是由漂白的和暴风雨中裂开的树枝、被山洪淹没的动物和被闪电劈开的风弯曲的树木组成。这些强大的生物--通常被误称为 \"木纹龙\"，因为它们的身体形态大部分是由裂开和分裂的木材构成的--是泰坦指挥官的魔法师、刺客和顾问。",
	"Firewrack dragons were the commanders and champions of the titan armies. While not as magically adept as their stormwrack cousins, they are slightly larger and just as capable in melee combat. Fighters to the last, firewracks combine aggressive instincts with a keen intellect focused on finding the most direct way to the soft underbelly of a problem.": "火裂龙是泰坦军队的指挥官和冠军。虽然在魔法方面不如它们的暴风龙表亲，但它们的体型略大，而且在近战中也同样有能力。作为最后的战士，火龙将攻击性的本能与敏锐的智力结合起来，专注于寻找最直接的方式来解决问题的软肋。",
	"This massive dragon is made not of flesh and scales, but a great assemblage of red-hot coals, glowing embers, and charred, smoldering bones such as those of scorched animals killed in forest blazes, but others as well that do not seem like they came from simple beasts. Its entire form shimmers with heat and glows with a dull radiance, and it is wreathed in foul smoke. It has wings that shimmer and smoke as well, but it seems unlikely that a creature this enormous could ever fly.": "这条巨大的龙不是由肉和鳞片构成的，而是由烧红的煤炭、发光的余烬和烧焦的、冒烟的骨头组成的，比如那些在森林大火中被烧死的动物的骨头，但也有一些看起来不像是来自简单野兽的骨头。它的整个外形闪烁着热量，发出暗淡的光芒，它被污浊的烟雾所包围。它的翅膀也闪烁着烟雾，但如此巨大的生物似乎不太可能飞行。",
	"Firewrack dragons are the largest and physically strongest of the wrack dragons, so they have good cause to be quite fearless in combat. They almost always use their breath weapon before closing into melee combat if opponents are within range. They tend to smash into or roll over most enemies, searing them with their great heat. They typically single out and seek to neutralize the most dangerous combatant as quickly as possible, seeing enemy magicians as the greatest threat, even to the exclusion of similarly dangerous warriors.": "火龙是最大的，也是身体最强壮的，所以它们有充分的理由在战斗中表现得相当无畏。如果对手在范围内，它们几乎总是在进入近战前使用它们的呼吸武器。它们倾向于砸向或滚过大多数敌人，用它们巨大的热量灼伤他们。他们通常单挑并寻求尽快解决最危险的战斗人员，将敌人的魔法师视为最大的威胁，甚至将类似的危险战士排除在外。",
	"Most firewrack dragons perished in the Divine War, and those that did not were hunted down shortly thereafter. Those that did survive usually hide deep underground or in blasted volcanic wastelands where their smoldering hides do not betray them. (In how many places might a huge, animate mass of smoldering timbers, superheated rock, and scorched flesh hide?)": "大多数火龙在神战中丧生，而那些没有丧生的火龙则在不久之后被猎杀。那些幸存下来的龙通常躲在地下深处或被炸毁的火山荒地里，在那里它们燃烧的皮毛不会出卖它们。(一个巨大的、由燃烧的木材、过热的岩石和烧焦的肉体组成的有生命的群体可能藏在多少地方？）",
	"The icewrack dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.": "冰轨龙可以在冰面上移动和攀爬，而不需要进行能力检查。此外，由冰或雪组成的困难地形也不需要花费它额外的时间。",
	"The icewrack dragon's weapon attacks are magical. When the icewrack hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an additional 4 ({@damage 1d8}) cold damage (included in the attack).

	"Like winter in the mountains, ice-wrack dragons are cold and cruel. They are more likely to lure interlopers into a snowcovered crevasse or icy deadfall than to confront them directly.

	"Legends say that the human King of Darakeene presented a dozen prize mastiffs to King Thorvann as a gesture of gratitude for the dwarves' aid during the goblin invasions. The gift was largely symbolic, as dwarves are not known to be keepers of hounds, but Thorvann was greatly impressed with the dogs, and set about trying to improve the breed.

	"Created to be a weapon of war, the flailing dreadnought is a fierce, but not very bright opponent. It almost always rushes into combat, roaring and biting, and if it has several opponents near it unleashes its flailing burst as often as possible. Against fewer enemies, or those who try to maintain their distance, the dreadnought drags foes about the battlefield to place them wherever is most advantageous for itself.": "作为一种战争武器，无畏舰是一个凶猛的，但不是很聪明的对手。它几乎总是冲进战斗，咆哮着咬人，如果它附近有几个对手，它就会尽可能频繁地释放它的甩动式爆发力。面对较少的敌人，或者那些试图保持距离的敌人，无畏舰会把敌人拖到战场上，把他们放在对自己最有利的地方。",

	"Flay beasts are the spawn of Hrinruuk, conceived by the evil titan to attack and devour indiscriminately as he sometimes did. They provide no benefit to nature, other than to cull the weak, but their tenacity is such that they will kill an entire pack of animals, leaving no survivors and therefore no food for later. They readily turn on one another, attacking a wounded flay beast as soon as they deal with any other prey.": "剥皮兽是赫林鲁克的后代，由邪恶的泰坦设想，像他有时那样不分青红皂白地攻击和吞噬。它们对自然界没有任何好处，除了清除弱者之外，但它们的韧性使它们会杀死一整群动物，不留下任何幸存者，因此没有食物可供以后食用。它们很容易彼此反目，一处理其他猎物就会攻击受伤的剥皮兽。",
	"Flay beasts almost always hunt alone and remain alone for most of their lives. They are hermaphroditic and lay clutches of eggs beneath the ground. The eggs hatch within 2d4 weeks—a flay beast's first meal is often their slightly slower sibling. Those that survive are fully grown after a year. Grown flay beasts will sometimes organize into flights of 4 to 8 creatures in order to hunt something that they could not individually take down. They are found in wild areas of Termana and Asherak. There have never been any confirmed sightings on Ghelspad, despite occasional tales of of corpses bearing the marks of their attacks.": "剥皮兽几乎总是单独捕猎，并在其生命的大部分时间里保持孤独。它们是雌雄同体的，在地面下产卵。卵在24周内孵化--剥皮兽的第一餐往往是它们稍慢的兄弟姐妹。那些存活下来的剥皮兽在一年后就完全长大了。长大后的剥皮兽有时会组织成4到8只的飞行队伍，以猎取它们无法单独拿下的东西。它们被发现在Termana和Asherak的野生地区。Ghelspad上从来没有任何确认的目击事件，尽管偶尔有关于尸体上有它们攻击的痕迹的传说。",
	"The flay beast is usually a solitary hunter and ambushes its prey, either from the sky above or by hiding in foliage until the creature is close enough for an effective pounce attack. Once it reveals itself, it is relentless in its attacks and will use its pounce attack indiscriminately, even if provokes other attacks. They fight to the death, because a wounded flay beast is simply another meal to a healthy one.": "剥皮兽通常是一个单独的猎手，它埋伏在猎物的上方，或者躲在树叶中，直到该生物接近到足以进行有效的扑杀攻击。一旦露面，它的攻击是无情的，会不分青红皂白地使用它的扑击攻击，即使激起其他攻击。它们会殊死搏斗，因为受伤的剥皮兽对健康的剥皮兽来说只是另一顿饭。",
	"A creature slain by the Flesh Corruption feature decomposes at an unnaturally accelerated rate, reduced to a pool of putrefied muck after {@dice 2d6} minutes.

	"A flesh corruptor is a pitiful creature, a vaguely humanoid walking mass of decay. Oozing sores and seeping wounds run rampant across its exposed flesh, and great, yellowish blisters cover its hands and feet. Its hunched posture and cowl hide its face, and much of its body is concealed by a leper's rags and tattered robes.": "肉体腐化者是一种可怜的生物，是一种隐约可见的人形腐化物的行走物。渗出的疮和渗出的伤口在它裸露的肉体上横冲直撞，巨大的、淡黄色的水泡覆盖着它的手和脚。驼背的姿势和罩子遮住了它的脸，它的身体大部分被麻风病人的破布和破烂的长袍所掩盖。",
	"Flesh corruptors were created by Chern, and they are referred to in some old texts as \"Chern's children.\" The titan crafted his children to destroy whatever they touched by putrefying it. He also made sure that none of those killed would be raised to plague him again by giving the flesh corruptors an appetite for putrefied remains.": "肉体腐蚀者是由切尔恩创造的，他们在一些古老的文本中被称为 \"切尔恩的孩子\"。泰坦制作了他的孩子，通过腐烂来摧毁他们所接触的任何东西。他还通过赋予肉体腐蚀者对腐烂遗体的胃口，确保那些被杀的人不会再被唤醒来祸害他。",
	"Some flesh corruptors can still be found wandering the Mourning Marshes, especially along the borders of Vesh, although they have been discovered in many other regions as well. Cunning, the flesh corruptors hide by joining roving leper bands or other groups of poor, sick, and disenfranchised folk, following them from city to city. If any of the unfortunate wanderers ever notice their numbers shrinking, most assume they have simply lost another fellow to their ailments (or perhaps to predators, or simply to the elements).": "一些肉体腐化者仍然可以在哀伤沼泽地游荡，特别是在维希的边界，尽管他们在许多其他地区也被发现。狡猾的肉体腐化者通过加入流浪的麻风病人队伍或其他由贫穷、疾病和被剥夺权利的人组成的团体，跟随他们从一个城市到另一个城市来隐藏。如果任何一个不幸的流浪者注意到他们的数量在减少，大多数人都认为他们只是因为疾病而失去了另一个同伴（或者也许是被掠夺者，或者仅仅是被大自然吞噬）。",

There are actually two varieties of gorgons in the Scarred Lands: the bestial {@creature low gorgon|SLCC}, and the humanoid {@creature high gorgon|SLCC}. Although they seem as different as humans are from lions, both varieties of gorgon are actually aberrations, and repulsively, they are also completely interfertile—the males of either species can fertilize females of either kind.

	"A high gorgon looks like a hairless human with faintly elfin features, yet there is something indeterminably cold about its behavior. Within the smooth flesh of its abdomen lies a twisting mass of proboscises or tentacles shaped like fanged serpents. The gorgon can reveal these appendages via a bizarre muscled orifice, a barely discernible vertical slash like a tight-lipped mouth. When revealed, these serpentine appendages lash out through the wet crimson gap, their fangs dripping with venom. High gorgons have their own unique tongue, derived from Titan Speech, which they keep secret from all others except their low gorgon brethren.": "高脚龙看起来就像一个没有头发的人类，有着微弱的精灵特征，但它的行为却有一种难以确定的冷酷。在它腹部光滑的肉里，有一团扭曲的探针或触角，形状像长满獠牙的蛇。芡实可以通过一个怪异的肌肉孔洞露出这些附属物，一个几乎看不出来的垂直切口，就像一张紧闭的嘴。一旦露出来，这些蛇形的附属物就会从湿润的深红色缝隙中伸出来，它们的獠牙会滴下毒液。高脚龙有自己独特的舌头，源自泰坦语，它们对所有其他人都保密，除了低脚龙的兄弟们。",
