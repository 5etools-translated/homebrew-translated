On a success, it takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) necrotic damage.": "阿牛哥对一个生物进行一次徒手攻击，在目标的本质中产生一种不稳定，持续时间为（%0%）天。这种不稳定是无害的，除非牛哥用他的行动提前结束它。要做到这一点，牛哥和目标必须在同一个存在平面上。牛兄可以再次使用这个动作，迫使目标做出一个{@dc 19}的体质测试。如果失败，目标会被削弱到0马力。成功时，目标会受到55（%2%）的坏死伤害。",

If Brother Ox catches a missile in this way, he can throw the missile as a ranged weapon attack as part of the same reaction.

On a hit, it deals 18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) damage of a type appropriate to the missile.": "当牛哥被远程武器攻击击中时，他可以将自己受到的伤害减少25（（%0%））。如果这将伤害降低到0，如果导弹适合于一只手，并且他有一只手是空闲的，那么牛哥可以抓住导弹。如果牛兄以这种方式接住导弹，他可以将导弹作为远程武器攻击的一部分扔出去，作为同一反应的一部分。导弹的命中率为1%，短距离为30英尺，长距离为60英尺。一旦命中，就会造成18{@damage 3d8 + 5}的伤害，其类型与导弹相适应。",
	"Of all the animal lords, Brother Ox is the most contemplative, and the least likely to act despite his great power. He stands over fifteen feet tall, is strong enough to crush boulders, and moves like grass in the wind. He smells faintly of musk and incense and wears simple, homespun clothing without embellishments or adornments. His only possession is a string of wooden prayer beads. If he ever had a name other than Brother Ox, no one living remembers it and Brother Ox himself isn't telling.": "在所有的动物领主中，牛兄是最善于沉思的，尽管他的力量很大，但最不可能采取行动。他身高超过15英尺，力大无穷，足以压碎巨石，行动起来就像风中的草。他身上有淡淡的麝香和熏香的味道，穿着简单的家纺服装，没有任何装饰品或装饰品。他唯一的财产是一串木制的祈祷珠。如果他曾有过牛哥以外的名字，没有活人记得，牛哥自己也不说。",
	"Brother Ox lives atop the tallest mountain where the air is thin and bitter cold, filling his days with training, study, and contemplation to hone his physical and spiritual being.

	"Despite his vast, potentially endless, well of knowledge, Brother Ox isn't motivated to hand these pearls of wisdom out to anyone who asks. However, he has accepted the presence of the occasional pilgrim, and rarely, takes a yakirian (see page 390) or other supplicant as a long‑term student. Brother Ox is difficult to read and hasn't lost his composure in centuries. If a would-be knowledge‑seeker can survive the mountain journey and successfully locate the monastery, it might have to wait weeks or even years for Brother Ox to acknowledge its presence. Then he moves only to set the supplicant on a series of strange, menial, dangerous, or perplexing tasks before granting a request.": "尽管奥克斯弟兄拥有巨大的、可能是无穷无尽的知识井，但他并不愿意将这些智慧的珍珠传给任何要求的人。然而，他接受了偶尔出现的朝圣者，而且很少接受亚基里安（见第390页）或其他祈求者作为长期学生。牛兄很难读懂，几个世纪以来，他都没有失去冷静。如果一个想寻求知识的人能够熬过山路，并成功找到寺院，可能要等上几周甚至几年，牛大哥才会承认自己的存在。然后，在批准请求之前，他只会让请求者完成一系列奇怪、琐碎、危险或令人困惑的任务。",
	"Brother Ox doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "牛弟兄不需要吃、喝、睡。",
	"Brother Ox's lair is a sprawling, stone monastery atop one of the tallest mountains in the world.

	"While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils.

Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the {@creature Mouse King|CCodex|Mouse King's} ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the {@creature Lord of Vultures|CCodex}.": "虽然人类有庞大的万神殿和各种类型的神灵，但世界上的动物却有更简单的信仰形式。在每个物种中，总有一个以人形形式体现动物精神的典范，以便更好地与他人交谈，并在天体会议上代表动物。％0％）与沙漠中的神灵对话，而（％1％）则拥有广阔的领土，眼睛随着上升气流轻轻地飘向世界各地。每个动物领主都以某种神秘的、不可知的方式看到并与它的物种成员交流。来自粮仓和厨房的消息总是能传到（%2%）的耳朵里，而来自战场或麦田的消息则不可避免地落在（%3%）的遥远巢穴里。",
	"What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency.

In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.": "动物领主用他们的军团和大量的信息做什么？一些圣人认为，他们把这些信息交易给其他人物，包括恶魔和天使，以换取被理解为最好的天体货币的好处。还有人说，他们只是告诉他们的追随者要避免的危险，要猎取的丰富猎物，或类似的问题。在许多情况下，动物领主发现他们既有时间也有意愿偶尔插手人类的事务，特别是那些对其追随者特别仁慈或异常残忍的人。",
	"As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the {@creature Queen of Cats|CCodex} and, to some degree, the {@creature Mouse King|CCodex} have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).": "作为一个团体，动物领主照顾他们自己，他们捍卫他们的领地和他们的力量源泉，反对人形生物的侵占。动物领主之间最大的争论是，是与类人世界结盟（就像（%0%）和（%1%）在某种程度上所做的那样），还是保持在它之外（就像其他人那样）。",

Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 ({@damage 12d10}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	"Ankou are made from the spirits of dragons, and their natural form is that of a shadowy wyrm. However, ankou rarely manifest before mortals in their natural form for fear of sowing chaos throughout the mortal world. Many humanoid cultures tell legends of the ankou's baleful visage, claiming that the sight of an ankou in its true form is enough to drive a sane human mad and a dead human's spirit to becoming a howling specter. An ankou can adopt the form of any creature it has seen in its life or unlife, but tell‑tale signs of its true nature always leak through to the new form, such as a hollow voice that does not echo or wispy hair, fur, or feathers that move by an unfelt wind. The most popular forms for ankou to assume are humanoid skeletons, ravens, kindly elders, or young children.": "Ankou是由龙的精神组成的，他们的自然形态是一个朦胧的巫妖。然而，安库很少以其自然形态出现在凡人面前，因为他们害怕在整个凡人世界中播下混乱的种子。许多人形文化讲述了关于阿库的可怕面孔的传说，声称看到阿库的真实形态就足以让一个正常的人发疯，而一个死去的人的灵魂也会变成一个嚎叫的幽灵。ankou可以采用它在生前或死后见过的任何生物的形态，但其真实本性的蛛丝马迹总是会渗入到新的形态中，例如没有回声的空洞的声音，或在无感的风中移动的飘渺的头发、毛发或羽毛。最受欢迎的形态是人形骷髅、乌鸦、慈祥的长者或幼童。",
	"The role of the ankou is a necessary one, but one which few dragons would willingly accept. Some dragons go to extreme lengths to avoid being the first to die in a new century with some even going so far as to accept lichdom before accepting the duty of the ankou. The gods of death are loathe to share such deep secrets with mortals, but it is known that the dragons that become ankou serve for eternity. All ankou obey the gods of death unquestioningly, greeting the souls of the deceased at the moment of their death and escorting them across the planes to their final resting place. A single soul herald ankou serves directly beneath the gods of death, commanding the ranks of ankou soul seekers. Typically, a single seeker claims and transports a soul to the herald residing in an extraplanar retreat, who then offers it personally to the gods of death.": "Ankou的角色是一个必要的角色，但很少有龙愿意接受这个角色。有些龙为了避免成为新世纪第一个死去的人，不惜采取极端的手段，有些龙甚至在接受安库的职责之前就已经接受了贵族身份。死亡之神不愿意与凡人分享如此深奥的秘密，但众所周知，成为ankou的龙会永远服务。所有ankou都毫无疑问地服从死亡之神，在死者死亡的那一刻迎接他们的灵魂，并护送他们穿越各个星球到他们最后的安息之地。一个灵魂预言家安库直接在死神之下服务，指挥安库寻魂者的队伍。通常情况下，一个寻魂者声称并将一个灵魂运送给居住在星外隐居地的传令官，然后由他亲自将其提供给死神。",
	"Though they can live until the end of time, ankou can be killed. Likewise, though ankou have grown wise through eons of life and unlife, they can still be fooled by canny mortals. While creatures that cheat death through cunning and their own wit are often treated with grudging respect by the ushers of souls, the ankou are still duty-bound to send the creatures to the realms of death. Mortals who cheat death by killing ankou gain no such admiration. While a skilled warrior or a powerful dragon can best a single ankou, the slaughter of one of their own sends the ankou into a rage. The ankou soul herald hunts down the transgressor personally in order to cast the creature's soul into the Hells to suffer for its transgression.": "虽然他们可以活到时间的尽头，但ankou可以被杀死。同样地，尽管安库在漫长的生命和非生命中变得聪明，但它们仍然可以被聪明的凡人所愚弄。虽然通过狡猾和自己的智慧来欺骗死亡的生物通常会受到灵魂领主的勉强尊重，但安库仍然有责任将这些生物送入死亡的境界。通过杀死ankou来欺骗死亡的凡人不会得到这样的敬佩。虽然一个熟练的战士或强大的龙可以胜过一个安库，但屠杀自己人的行为会让安库陷入愤怒。灵魂预言家会亲自追捕犯罪者，以便将该生物的灵魂投入地狱，为其犯罪行为受罪。",
	"The ankou doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "安口不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Ankou are rarely granted a chance to rest, constantly traveling the planes to usher spirits to their final resting places. When an ankou has a moment of respite, it often returns to the lair it kept in life. This sometimes creates awkward situations for the dragon's family if they still reside in this lair; even dragons have some apprehensions about sharing a home with a relativeturned-reaper. When residing alone, an ankou often decorates its lair with mementos that recall its slowly fading memories of its former life, such as portraits of mortal friends long dead, electrum coins minted by a friend from a now-destroyed kingdom, or the spellbooks of a fallen comrade.": "Ankou很少有机会得到休息，它不断地在各个星球上旅行，把灵魂带到它们最后的安息之地。当阿库有喘息的机会时，它往往会回到它生前的巢穴。如果龙的家人仍然居住在这个巢穴中，这有时会造成尴尬的局面；即使是龙也会对与一个变成死神的亲戚共享一个家而感到忧虑。当独自居住时，龙经常用纪念品来装饰它的巢穴，以唤起它对以前生活的慢慢消逝的记忆，例如早已死去的凡人朋友的肖像，由一个现在被摧毁的王国的朋友铸造的电子币，或一个死去的同志的法术书。",
	"All ankou lairs have a pile of bleached bones somewhere within. These death spirits find that they sleep best when nestled on a bed of bones.": "所有安库的巢穴里都有一堆漂白的骨头。这些死神发现，当他们依偎在骨头床上时，睡得最好。",

Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.": "{@atk mw}{@hit 5}击中，达到0英尺，蜂群空间中的一个生物。{@h}14 ({@damage 4d6})的穿刺伤害，或7 ({@damage 2d6})的穿刺伤害，如果蜂群有一半的命中率或更少。目标必须做一个{@dc 13}体质救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到7({@damage 2d6}的毒药伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。如果目标穿着非魔法盔甲，该盔甲会对其提供的AC值进行永久和累积的1次惩罚。降到AC值10的盔甲会被摧毁。",

	"Plaresh demons arise from the slime and offal left behind in the wake of Qorgeth, Demon Lord of the Devouring Worm (Tome of Beasts, p. 90). Individually, these tiny worm demons are little more than a disgusting nuisance. When they band together into writhing masses hundreds or even thousands strong, the story changes drastically. The plaresh is an amalgamation of these demonic slivers, each linked into a cruel hive mind driven to common purpose in the service of the Writhing Prince.": "狰狞的恶魔来自于吞噬之虫的恶魔领主Qorgeth留下的粘液和内脏（《魔兽世界》第90页）。单独来看，这些微小的蠕虫魔只是一个令人厌恶的讨厌鬼。当它们聚集在一起，形成数百甚至数千人的蠕动群体时，故事就发生了巨大的变化。plaresh是这些恶魔碎片的混合体，每一个都连接成一个残酷的蜂巢，被驱使着为蠕动王子服务的共同目标。",
	"Plaresh demons are more intelligent than any mortal vermin, but their lord's insatiable hunger overwhelms complex thought. Sometimes they act with a disturbing purpose which hints at a greater intelligence or plan, but mostly they exist to eat. When they devour a humanoid corpse, they send the unfortunate creature's soul to Qorgeth's tunnel‑realm, and a new plaresh slips through in the wake of the soul's passing.": "Plaresh恶魔比任何凡人的害虫都要聪明，但他们的主人贪得无厌的饥饿感压倒了复杂的思维。有时它们的行为带有令人不安的目的，暗示着更大的智慧或计划，但大多数情况下它们的存在是为了吃。当它们吞噬了一具人形的尸体时，它们会将这个不幸的生物的灵魂送入Qorgeth的隧道领域，而在灵魂逝去之后，一个新的斑纹会滑过。",
	"As a bonus action, the rattok demon consumes one of the bottled souls in its possession, regaining 7 ({@dice 2d4 + 2}) hp and gaining advantage on all attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round. Any non-fiend who consumes a bottled soul regains 7 ({@dice 2d4 + 2}) hit points and must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is {@condition stunned} for 1 round and {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. On a success, the creature is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour.": "作为一个额外的行动，拉托克恶魔消耗它所拥有的一个瓶装灵魂，恢复7（（%0%））的生命值，并在1个回合内获得所有攻击卷和能力检查的优势。任何吞噬了瓶装灵魂的非火系生物都会恢复7（（%1%））的生命值，并且必须做一个（%2%）宪法规定的蓄力动作。如果失败，该生物将在1个回合内受到{@condition stunned}的伤害，并在1小时内受到{@condition poisoned}的伤害。成功时，该生物会被{@condition poisoned}，持续1小时。",
	"Whenever the rattok demon is subjected to fire or necrotic damage, it takes no damage and instead is unaffected by spells and other magical effects that would impede its movement. This trait works like the freedom of movement spell, except it only lasts for 1 minute.": "每当拉托克恶魔受到火或坏死的伤害时，它就不会受到伤害，而是不受法术和其他会阻碍其行动的魔法效果的影响。这个特性的作用类似于行动自由法术，只是它只持续1分钟。",

	"The rattok unleashes a wave of shadowy versions of itself that fan out and rake dark claws across all creatures within 15 feet. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "拉托克释放出一波阴暗的自身，它们呈扇形展开，将黑暗的爪子划过15英尺内的所有生物。该区域内的每个生物都必须做一个{@dc 13}灵巧的蓄力动作，如果蓄力失败，将受到14({@damage 4d6})的坏死伤害，如果蓄力成功，将受到一半的伤害。",
	"Thoroughly gross and decadent, rattok demons sport patchy fur, sharp whiskers, notched ears, dangling charms and amulets, and long claws. They delight in manipulating souls and are fond of both necrotic energy and pure flames.": "彻底的恶心和颓废，拉托克恶魔拥有斑驳的皮毛、尖锐的胡须、有凹槽的耳朵、悬挂的符咒和护身符，以及长长的爪子。他们乐于操纵灵魂，喜欢坏死的能量和纯粹的火焰。",
	"Often called rat demons, the rattok do serve {@creature Chittr'k'k, Demon Lord of Rats|CCodex|Chittr'k'k, Demon Lord of Rats}, though many also serve other demons. They are greasy, sneering, smug and horrible bullies to lesser demons and enjoy tormenting those they catch. At the same time, they are complete toadies to larger and more powerful demons—though bold enough to sometimes play tricks on their masters. They spend most of their time in narrow tunnels, sewers, and caverns of the Abyss.": "通常被称为鼠魔，鼠魔确实为（%0%）服务，尽管许多人也为其他恶魔服务。对较小的恶魔来说，他们是油腻的、冷笑的、自鸣得意的和可怕的恶霸，并喜欢折磨那些被他们抓住的人。同时，他们对更大、更强大的恶魔来说完全是个奴才--尽管有时大胆到会对他们的主人耍花招。他们大部分时间都呆在狭窄的隧道、下水道和深渊的洞穴里。",
	"Rattok demons collect, bottle, and often distill and flavor souls, trading them and generating abhorrent bottled spirits from them. These bottled souls resemble potions. Consuming a bottled soul destroys a portion of a living soul and floods the drinker's mind with some of the soul's memories.": "拉托克恶魔收集、装瓶，并经常对灵魂进行蒸馏和调味，交易它们并从中产生可憎的瓶装烈酒。这些瓶装灵魂类似于药水。饮用瓶装灵魂会毁掉一部分活着的灵魂，并使饮用者的头脑中充斥着灵魂的一些记忆。",
	"A rattok demon's peculiar claws are a visible sign of its foulness, but its true evil lies within. Rattoks are famous as torturers, cannibals, slavers, and connivers—they constantly strive to outdo one another in vileness, and, among demonkind, they are known for their especially inventive evil deeds.": "拉托克恶魔奇特的爪子是其肮脏的明显标志，但其真正的邪恶在于内在。拉托克人是著名的施虐者、食人者、奴隶主和纵容者--他们不断努力在邪恶方面超越对方，而且在恶魔族中，他们因其特别有创意的邪恶行为而闻名。",

	"If a creature confused by the spree demon's claw attack reduces a target to 0 hp, the confused creature must make a successful {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness (see the System Reference Document 5.1). If a creature fails this saving throw again while already suffering from a madness, it gains a long-term madness instead.": "如果一个被恶魔之爪的攻击所迷惑的生物将一个目标减少到0HP，这个迷惑的生物必须成功地进行一个{@dc 14}智慧救赎，或者获得一个短期的疯狂（见系统参考文件5.1）。如果一个生物在已经遭受疯狂状态的情况下再次失败，它将获得长期疯狂状态。",
	"The spree demon makes two claw attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. While {@condition frightened} this way, the creature believes it has shrunk to half its normal size. All attacks against the creature do an extra 7 ({@damage 2d6}) psychic damage, and the creature's attacks do half damage. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "恶魔会进行两次爪子攻击。如果这两次攻击都击中了同一个目标，目标必须成功进行{@dc 14}智慧救赎，否则会变成{@condition frightened}，持续1分钟。当{@condition frightened}这样时，该生物认为它已经缩减到正常大小的一半。所有对该生物的攻击都会造成额外的7({@damage 2d6})精神伤害，而该生物的攻击会造成一半伤害。一个{@condition frightened}的生物可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对它的影响。",
	"{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage, and the creature must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target can't take reactions and must roll a {@dice d10} at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn for 1 minute. This works like the confusion spell. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 6}击中，到达5英尺，一个目标。{@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3})的砍击伤害加上10 ({@damage 3d6})的毒药伤害，并且该生物必须做一个{@dc 14}的宪法救赎动作。如果失败，目标不能做出反应，必须在每个回合开始时掷出{@dice d10}来决定它在该回合的行为，持续1分钟。这和迷惑咒语的作用一样。目标可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对它的影响。如果一个生物的救赎成功或效果结束，该生物在接下来的24小时内对该效果免疫。",
