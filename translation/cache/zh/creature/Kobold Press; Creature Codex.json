On a success, it takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) necrotic damage.": "阿牛哥对一个生物进行一次徒手攻击，在目标的本质中产生一种不稳定，持续时间为（%0%）天。这种不稳定是无害的，除非牛哥用他的行动提前结束它。要做到这一点，牛哥和目标必须在同一个存在平面上。牛兄可以再次使用这个动作，迫使目标做出一个{@dc 19}的体质测试。如果失败，目标会被削弱到0马力。成功时，目标会受到55（%2%）的坏死伤害。",

If Brother Ox catches a missile in this way, he can throw the missile as a ranged weapon attack as part of the same reaction.

On a hit, it deals 18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) damage of a type appropriate to the missile.": "当牛哥被远程武器攻击击中时，他可以将自己受到的伤害减少25（（%0%））。如果这将伤害降低到0，如果导弹适合于一只手，并且他有一只手是空闲的，那么牛哥可以抓住导弹。如果牛兄以这种方式接住导弹，他可以将导弹作为远程武器攻击的一部分扔出去，作为同一反应的一部分。导弹的命中率为1%，短距离为30英尺，长距离为60英尺。一旦命中，就会造成18{@damage 3d8 + 5}的伤害，其类型与导弹相适应。",
	"Of all the animal lords, Brother Ox is the most contemplative, and the least likely to act despite his great power. He stands over fifteen feet tall, is strong enough to crush boulders, and moves like grass in the wind. He smells faintly of musk and incense and wears simple, homespun clothing without embellishments or adornments. His only possession is a string of wooden prayer beads. If he ever had a name other than Brother Ox, no one living remembers it and Brother Ox himself isn't telling.": "在所有的动物领主中，牛兄是最善于沉思的，尽管他的力量很大，但最不可能采取行动。他身高超过15英尺，力大无穷，足以压碎巨石，行动起来就像风中的草。他身上有淡淡的麝香和熏香的味道，穿着简单的家纺服装，没有任何装饰品或装饰品。他唯一的财产是一串木制的祈祷珠。如果他曾有过牛哥以外的名字，没有活人记得，牛哥自己也不说。",
	"Brother Ox lives atop the tallest mountain where the air is thin and bitter cold, filling his days with training, study, and contemplation to hone his physical and spiritual being.

	"Despite his vast, potentially endless, well of knowledge, Brother Ox isn't motivated to hand these pearls of wisdom out to anyone who asks. However, he has accepted the presence of the occasional pilgrim, and rarely, takes a yakirian (see page 390) or other supplicant as a long‑term student. Brother Ox is difficult to read and hasn't lost his composure in centuries. If a would-be knowledge‑seeker can survive the mountain journey and successfully locate the monastery, it might have to wait weeks or even years for Brother Ox to acknowledge its presence. Then he moves only to set the supplicant on a series of strange, menial, dangerous, or perplexing tasks before granting a request.": "尽管奥克斯弟兄拥有巨大的、可能是无穷无尽的知识井，但他并不愿意将这些智慧的珍珠传给任何要求的人。然而，他接受了偶尔出现的朝圣者，而且很少接受亚基里安（见第390页）或其他祈求者作为长期学生。牛兄很难读懂，几个世纪以来，他都没有失去冷静。如果一个想寻求知识的人能够熬过山路，并成功找到寺院，可能要等上几周甚至几年，牛大哥才会承认自己的存在。然后，在批准请求之前，他只会让请求者完成一系列奇怪、琐碎、危险或令人困惑的任务。",
	"Brother Ox doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "牛弟兄不需要吃、喝、睡。",
	"Brother Ox's lair is a sprawling, stone monastery atop one of the tallest mountains in the world.

	"While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils.

Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the {@creature Mouse King|CCodex|Mouse King's} ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the {@creature Lord of Vultures|CCodex}.": "虽然人类有庞大的万神殿和各种类型的神灵，但世界上的动物却有更简单的信仰形式。在每个物种中，总有一个以人形形式体现动物精神的典范，以便更好地与他人交谈，并在天体会议上代表动物。％0％）与沙漠中的神灵对话，而（％1％）则拥有广阔的领土，眼睛随着上升气流轻轻地飘向世界各地。每个动物领主都以某种神秘的、不可知的方式看到并与它的物种成员交流。来自粮仓和厨房的消息总是能传到（%2%）的耳朵里，而来自战场或麦田的消息则不可避免地落在（%3%）的遥远巢穴里。",
	"What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency.

In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.": "动物领主用他们的军团和大量的信息做什么？一些圣人认为，他们把这些信息交易给其他人物，包括恶魔和天使，以换取被理解为最好的天体货币的好处。还有人说，他们只是告诉他们的追随者要避免的危险，要猎取的丰富猎物，或类似的问题。在许多情况下，动物领主发现他们既有时间也有意愿偶尔插手人类的事务，特别是那些对其追随者特别仁慈或异常残忍的人。",
	"As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the {@creature Queen of Cats|CCodex} and, to some degree, the {@creature Mouse King|CCodex} have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).": "作为一个团体，动物领主照顾他们自己，他们捍卫他们的领地和他们的力量源泉，反对人形生物的侵占。动物领主之间最大的争论是，是与类人世界结盟（就像（%0%）和（%1%）在某种程度上所做的那样），还是保持在它之外（就像其他人那样）。",

Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 ({@damage 12d10}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	"Ankou are made from the spirits of dragons, and their natural form is that of a shadowy wyrm. However, ankou rarely manifest before mortals in their natural form for fear of sowing chaos throughout the mortal world. Many humanoid cultures tell legends of the ankou's baleful visage, claiming that the sight of an ankou in its true form is enough to drive a sane human mad and a dead human's spirit to becoming a howling specter. An ankou can adopt the form of any creature it has seen in its life or unlife, but tell‑tale signs of its true nature always leak through to the new form, such as a hollow voice that does not echo or wispy hair, fur, or feathers that move by an unfelt wind. The most popular forms for ankou to assume are humanoid skeletons, ravens, kindly elders, or young children.": "Ankou是由龙的精神组成的，他们的自然形态是一个朦胧的巫妖。然而，安库很少以其自然形态出现在凡人面前，因为他们害怕在整个凡人世界中播下混乱的种子。许多人形文化讲述了关于阿库的可怕面孔的传说，声称看到阿库的真实形态就足以让一个正常的人发疯，而一个死去的人的灵魂也会变成一个嚎叫的幽灵。ankou可以采用它在生前或死后见过的任何生物的形态，但其真实本性的蛛丝马迹总是会渗入到新的形态中，例如没有回声的空洞的声音，或在无感的风中移动的飘渺的头发、毛发或羽毛。最受欢迎的形态是人形骷髅、乌鸦、慈祥的长者或幼童。",
	"The role of the ankou is a necessary one, but one which few dragons would willingly accept. Some dragons go to extreme lengths to avoid being the first to die in a new century with some even going so far as to accept lichdom before accepting the duty of the ankou. The gods of death are loathe to share such deep secrets with mortals, but it is known that the dragons that become ankou serve for eternity. All ankou obey the gods of death unquestioningly, greeting the souls of the deceased at the moment of their death and escorting them across the planes to their final resting place. A single soul herald ankou serves directly beneath the gods of death, commanding the ranks of ankou soul seekers. Typically, a single seeker claims and transports a soul to the herald residing in an extraplanar retreat, who then offers it personally to the gods of death.": "Ankou的角色是一个必要的角色，但很少有龙愿意接受这个角色。有些龙为了避免成为新世纪第一个死去的人，不惜采取极端的手段，有些龙甚至在接受安库的职责之前就已经接受了贵族身份。死亡之神不愿意与凡人分享如此深奥的秘密，但众所周知，成为ankou的龙会永远服务。所有ankou都毫无疑问地服从死亡之神，在死者死亡的那一刻迎接他们的灵魂，并护送他们穿越各个星球到他们最后的安息之地。一个灵魂预言家安库直接在死神之下服务，指挥安库寻魂者的队伍。通常情况下，一个寻魂者声称并将一个灵魂运送给居住在星外隐居地的传令官，然后由他亲自将其提供给死神。",
	"Though they can live until the end of time, ankou can be killed. Likewise, though ankou have grown wise through eons of life and unlife, they can still be fooled by canny mortals. While creatures that cheat death through cunning and their own wit are often treated with grudging respect by the ushers of souls, the ankou are still duty-bound to send the creatures to the realms of death. Mortals who cheat death by killing ankou gain no such admiration. While a skilled warrior or a powerful dragon can best a single ankou, the slaughter of one of their own sends the ankou into a rage. The ankou soul herald hunts down the transgressor personally in order to cast the creature's soul into the Hells to suffer for its transgression.": "虽然他们可以活到时间的尽头，但ankou可以被杀死。同样地，尽管安库在漫长的生命和非生命中变得聪明，但它们仍然可以被聪明的凡人所愚弄。虽然通过狡猾和自己的智慧来欺骗死亡的生物通常会受到灵魂领主的勉强尊重，但安库仍然有责任将这些生物送入死亡的境界。通过杀死ankou来欺骗死亡的凡人不会得到这样的敬佩。虽然一个熟练的战士或强大的龙可以胜过一个安库，但屠杀自己人的行为会让安库陷入愤怒。灵魂预言家会亲自追捕犯罪者，以便将该生物的灵魂投入地狱，为其犯罪行为受罪。",
	"The ankou doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "安口不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Ankou are rarely granted a chance to rest, constantly traveling the planes to usher spirits to their final resting places. When an ankou has a moment of respite, it often returns to the lair it kept in life. This sometimes creates awkward situations for the dragon's family if they still reside in this lair; even dragons have some apprehensions about sharing a home with a relativeturned-reaper. When residing alone, an ankou often decorates its lair with mementos that recall its slowly fading memories of its former life, such as portraits of mortal friends long dead, electrum coins minted by a friend from a now-destroyed kingdom, or the spellbooks of a fallen comrade.": "Ankou很少有机会得到休息，它不断地在各个星球上旅行，把灵魂带到它们最后的安息之地。当阿库有喘息的机会时，它往往会回到它生前的巢穴。如果龙的家人仍然居住在这个巢穴中，这有时会造成尴尬的局面；即使是龙也会对与一个变成死神的亲戚共享一个家而感到忧虑。当独自居住时，龙经常用纪念品来装饰它的巢穴，以唤起它对以前生活的慢慢消逝的记忆，例如早已死去的凡人朋友的肖像，由一个现在被摧毁的王国的朋友铸造的电子币，或一个死去的同志的法术书。",
	"All ankou lairs have a pile of bleached bones somewhere within. These death spirits find that they sleep best when nestled on a bed of bones.": "所有安库的巢穴里都有一堆漂白的骨头。这些死神发现，当他们依偎在骨头床上时，睡得最好。",

	"Plaresh demons arise from the slime and offal left behind in the wake of Qorgeth, Demon Lord of the Devouring Worm (Tome of Beasts, p. 90). Individually, these tiny worm demons are little more than a disgusting nuisance. When they band together into writhing masses hundreds or even thousands strong, the story changes drastically.

	"Legends say that the first jinmenju tree sprouted from the severed head of a traveling jester. The tree that grew from the jester's head bore white fruit with a human face that laughed incessantly.

	"A jinmenju grows wherever its seeds take root. Since animals are unaffected by its fruit's magic, they can spread its seeds by eating the fruit and excreting the seeds, just like any other plant. Sometimes travelers pick jinmenju fruit and take it along to keep them company until it rots and they discard it. A jinmenju prefers to grow in shady groves and temperate rainforests, and jinmenju saplings will sometimes ask travelers to uproot them and relocate them to more favorable terrain.": "金门酒在其种子扎根的地方生长。由于动物不受其果实魔法的影响，它们可以通过吃果实和排泄种子来传播其种子，就像其他植物一样。有时，旅行者会采摘金门菊果实，并将其带在身边陪伴他们，直到果实腐烂，他们才将其丢弃。金门菊喜欢生长在阴凉的小树林和温带雨林中，金门菊树苗有时会要求旅行者把它们连根拔起，重新安置到更有利的地形上。",
