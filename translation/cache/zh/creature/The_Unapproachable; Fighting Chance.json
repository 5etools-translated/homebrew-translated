	"When the legendary Gith made a pact with Tiamat and Ephelomon, Tiamat's red dragon consort, the githyanki were given the Scepter of Ephelomon and red dragon allies. The proud dragons would serve the githyanki as mounts in exchange for the githyanki aiding Tiamat whenever she called upon them.

	"Over the eons since the githyanki formed their pact with the Queen of Evil Dragons, their knowledge of their allies have only increased. Several githyanki queens have experimented with ways to leverage this for additional power. Based on these experiments and centuries of study, the Lich-Queen, Vlaakith the CLVII, leveraged the power of the scepter and created the duthka'gith, powerful githyanki warriors infused with the blood of red dragons. More powerful than a simple hybrid or hlaf-dragon, they were crafted with the power of the Nine Hells. These soldiers, though limited in number, pleased Vlaakith so much that they now serve her as her personal guard or as shock troops for particularly important missions.": "自从githyanki与恶龙女王订立契约以来，在漫长的岁月里，他们对盟友的了解也在不断增加。几位吉蒂亚克女王已经试验了利用这一点获得额外权力的方法。基于这些实验和几个世纪的研究，Lich-Queen，Vlaakith the CLVII，利用权杖的力量，创造了duthka'gith，强大的githyanki战士注入了红龙的血液。他们比简单的混血儿或赫拉夫-龙更强大，他们是用九层地狱的力量制作的。这些士兵虽然数量有限，但却让弗拉基斯非常满意，现在他们作为她的私人卫队，或作为特别重要任务的突击队为她服务。",
	"Whether it is simply a gift from Tiamat or the result of a red dragon bloodline, githyanki flameweavers are pyrokenetic masters. The flames that they conjure don't just scorch the body, but the mind as well. The pain and fear from their attacks can last long after the flames have been extinguished. This power and the simple ability to reduce their enemies to ashes means that flameweavers are often arrogant. It's usually justified.": "不管是来自提亚马特的礼物，还是红龙血统的结果，吉蒂亚克的喷火者都是热能大师。他们所召唤的火焰不仅能灼烧身体，还能灼烧心灵。他们的攻击所带来的痛苦和恐惧会在火焰熄灭后持续很久。这种力量和将敌人化为灰烬的简单能力意味着火焰使者常常是傲慢的。这通常是合理的。",
	"Githyuanki lichblades have made a soul-pact with the Lich-Queen to help her obtain her goal of becoming a god.

	"However, their powers aren't limited to simple spells and social standing. The soul-pact allows them to feed the Lich-Queen's hunger for power. Lichblades are wreathed in a frightful void that consumes the souls of the fallen (friend and foe alike) and shattered divine magic. This is why they hunger for slaughter and will go out of their way to target those that use divine magic. Disrupting divine spells and slaying religious devotees are the greatest sacrifices they can offer their queen.": "然而，他们的力量并不局限于简单的法术和社会地位。灵魂冲击使他们能够满足巫妖女王对力量的饥渴。巫妖刀被包裹在一个可怕的虚空中，它吞噬着堕落者（朋友和敌人）的灵魂和破碎的神术。这就是为什么他们渴望屠杀，并会不遗余力地针对那些使用神圣魔法的人。破坏神性法术和杀死宗教信徒是他们能够为女王提供的最大牺牲。",
	"Their role and powers make them universally feared amongst their kin. Standing next to a lichblade is almost universally avoided. All know that dying next to one is a terrible fate.

	"While not as martially potent as githyanki knights, githyanki mindraiders are versatile servants for the the Lich-Queen. They invest little time in learning the ways of a warrior and focus primarily on sharpening their psionic powers to access the minds of foes. As a result, they're just as likely to act as spies and courtroom manipulators as lead ruthless incursions to steal resources.": "虽然不像吉蒂亚克骑士那样具有强大的战斗力，但吉蒂亚克的心灵猎手是利希女王的全能仆人。他们在学习战士的方式上投入的时间很少，而主要集中在磨练他们的幻象能力以进入敌人的思想。因此，他们既可能充当间谍和法庭操纵者，也可能领导无情的入侵行动来窃取资源。",
	"Mindraiders are especially adept at making quick strikes into the Prime Material to gather slaves. Small warbands have been known to depopulate towns or, given enough time, entire regions. However, before starting a fullfledged raid, they scout out their target by dominating a local to examine the defenses and probe for weaknesses.": "Mindraiders特别善于快速袭击主物质以收集奴隶。据了解，小规模的战队可以使城镇人口减少，如果有足够的时间，也可以使整个地区人口减少。然而，在开始全面突袭之前，他们会通过控制一个地方来侦察他们的目标，以检查防御和探测弱点。",
	"Githyanki mindraiders gain significant advantages when paired with a dominated humanoid. The second set of eyes makes them harder to surprise, and the risk of harming an innocent is a powerful defense against would be heroes. This is why whenever they enter combat they have a dominated slave by their side -- or they quickly acquire one!": "当Githyanki智障者与一个被支配的人形生物配对时，他们会获得显著的优势。第二双眼睛使他们更难出其不意，而伤害无辜者的风险是对英雄的一种强有力的防御。这就是为什么每当他们进入战斗状态时，他们身边都会有一个被支配的奴隶--或者他们很快就会获得一个！这就是为什么他们会有一个被支配的奴隶。",
	"Some assume that leadership of gnoll war bands is gained by sacrificing victims on an altar. However, champions of slaughter don't gain stature by dispatching helpless victims tied to an altar. Methodical preparation and somber violence would shame the Lord of Savagery. Proper sacrifices are made during the brutal, blood-soaked orgies that the ignorant simply call 'gnoll raids'.": "有些人认为，地精战队的领导权是通过在祭坛上牺牲受害者而获得的。然而，屠杀的拥护者并不是通过将无助的受害者绑在祭坛上来获得地位的。有条不紊的准备和严肃的暴力会让野蛮人之主感到羞愧。适当的祭品是在残酷的、浸泡在血液中的狂欢中进行的，无知的人简单地称之为 \"地精突袭\"。",
	"The gnoll huntmaster is second only to the pack lord. It leads the hunters and scouts and is responsible for finding the pack's next target. Since this is the essential desire of the pack and ensures its survival, it's not uncommon for the most clever and skilled--if not the strongest and most martially adept--gnoll in the entire war band to fill this role. All huntmasters are skilled with their bow, picking off wounded prey, and rarely entering melee. As a result, these cunning gnolls usually live twice as long as most pack lords.": "地精猎手的地位仅次于族群首领。它领导猎人和侦察兵，负责寻找族群的下一个目标。由于这是族群的基本愿望，并确保其生存，所以整个战队中最聪明和最熟练的--如果不是最强壮和最擅长武术的--地精来担任这个角色是很常见的。所有的狩猎者都能熟练地使用他们的弓箭，摘下受伤的猎物，并且很少进入近战。因此，这些狡猾的地精通常比大多数族群领主的寿命长一倍。",
	"Before departing on an expedition, the huntmaster will consult with a fang of Yeenoghu or whichever shaman is in charge of interpreting the omens. That way, if an undefended village or caravan is not found, the huntmaster can deflect blame, which could bring death, and point its finger at those that gave it poor guidance.": "在出发远征之前，狩猎者会向Yeenoghu的一个方阵或负责解释预兆的任何一个萨满咨询。这样一来，如果没有找到一个不设防的村庄或商队，狩猎者可以转移责任，这可能会带来死亡，并将矛头指向那些给它提供不良指导的人。",
	"Gnolls that are esepcially eager to prove themselves to Yeenoghu and their pack take an oath of slaughter, pledging to cause a worthy amount of bloodshed in the name of their lord. Each gnoll deathpledge (sometimes simply called a 'slayer') is then endowed with an unholy aura and attacks that sunder bone and flesh. Whether a gnoll fulfills its pledge or not determines whether it rises in status or is reviled and punished by the pack.": "那些特别渴望向耶诺古和他们的族群证明自己的地精，会发下屠杀的誓言，保证以他们的主人的名义造成一定数量的流血。每个地精的死亡誓言（有时简单地称为 \"杀手\"）都被赋予了一种不神圣的光环，其攻击会将骨头和肉体撕裂。地精是否履行誓言，决定了它的地位是上升还是被群体谩骂和惩罚。",
	"This mobility in the pack's hierarchy can cause swift changes to the pecking order, even at the top. For, if a pack lord fails to deliver enough butchery to please Yeenoghu, the most successful deathpledge steps forward as a challenger. No matter the outcome, the Lord of Slaughter is pleased.": "狼群等级制度中的这种流动性可以导致啄食顺序的迅速变化，甚至在顶部。因为，如果一个狼群的领主未能提供足够的屠戮来取悦耶诺古，那么最成功的死亡誓言者就会站出来作为挑战者。无论结果如何，屠宰之主都会感到高兴。",
	"To become a gnoll goreface, a veteran of several raids must be chosen by a fang of Yeenoghu or shaman and painted with crude runes or granted a grizzly talisman. This ritual changes the hunger that drives all gnolls into a literal madness.": "要想成为地精的戈尔面，必须由耶诺古或萨满的獠牙选择，并涂上粗糙的符文或授予一个灰熊护身符。这个仪式改变了驱使所有地精的饥饿感，使其成为一种字面上的疯狂。",
	"Gorefaces are so overcome with bloodlust that they'll often gorge on fallen foes in the middle of combat. Contrary to what one would expect, this actually prolongs their ability to butcher. Yeenoghu rewards them--somehow making them implacable, propelling them along a ceaseless pilgrimage of carnage. If someone repeatedly deprives them of this, even another gnoll, they'll make it their next victim.": "嗜血者被嗜血的欲望所征服，以至于他们经常在战斗中吞食倒下的敌人。与人们所期望的相反，这实际上延长了他们屠杀的能力。 如果有人一再剥夺他们的这种能力，即使是另一个地精，他们也会把它作为下一个受害者。",
	"No gnoll chooses to become a gnoll mangeheart, often just referred to as shaman. Instead, Yeenoghu chooses mangehearts from the wounded and maimed. Promising gnolls are mended just enough that they aren't ripped apart by their pack mates. Then Yeenoghu gifts them with the ability to take the form of a hyena so that they're able to keep up with the war band and serve as furtive spies. Yet, no matter their form, they retain some outward sign of their injuries, a limp, missing ear or severe scarring. They're almost always accompanied by one or more hyenas, which are their only companions and assist with scouting.": "没有地精会选择成为地精的心腹，通常只是被称为萨满。相反，Yeenoghu从受伤和致残的人中挑选心腹。有希望的地精被修补得足够好，以至于他们不会被他们的族群伙伴撕碎。然后，耶诺古给他们提供了化身为鬣狗的能力，这样他们就能跟上战队的步伐，充当秘密的间谍。然而，无论他们的形态如何，他们都会保留一些受伤的外在迹象，如跛行、缺耳或严重的伤疤。它们几乎总是与一只或多只鬣狗为伴，这些鬣狗是它们唯一的伙伴，协助它们进行侦察。",
	"Regardless, gone are their days of wanton butchery, hewing victims in two with mighty axes. Instead, mangehearts must be content with conducting rituals that invest warriors with the Slaughter Lord's power, raise up rot-walkers and witherlings, and weaken foes for others to cut down. If gnolls were any other creature, they might look upon mangehearts with pity. Instead, they see a weakling that's one wrong step away from becoming a meal.": "不管怎么说，他们肆意屠戮的日子已经一去不复返了，用强大的斧头把受害者砍成两截。取而代之的是，人妖必须满足于举行仪式，为战士们注入屠杀之王的力量，培养出腐烂的行尸走肉和凋零者，并削弱敌人的力量，让他们去砍杀。如果地精是任何其他生物，他们可能会以怜悯的眼光看待地精。相反，他们看到的是一个离成为食物只有一步之遥的弱者。",
	"It's a rule that maimed or dead gnolls don't last long. Surviving pack members devour their flesh and preserve the bones to use in rituals to create witherlings.": "受伤或死亡的地精不会持续太久，这是一条规则。幸存的族群成员会吞噬他们的肉，并将骨头保存起来，用于创造凋零者的祭祀活动。",
	"Similarly, it's also true that gnolls warbands don't attack fortified positions, opting for softer targets. Yet, sometimes Yeenoghu needs to shatter strongholds to open up an entire region to his rampaging reavers. And sometimes, he's just bored. At these times, the Ruler of Ruin and Rot sends omens and signs.": "同样，地精战队也确实不会攻击坚固的阵地，而是选择较软的目标。然而，有时耶诺古需要打碎据点，为他横冲直撞的食人魔打开整个区域。而有时，他只是觉得无聊。在这些时候，废墟和腐烂的统治者会发出预兆和迹象。",
	"The fangs of Yeenoghu and the mangehearts watch for portents when their warband is near a castle or walled town. If enemy shields shatter or slain gnolls putrify before eaten, they set aside the corpses. That night, they conduct a dark ritual, animating the dead which Yeenoghu blesses with a different weapon: disease. These blighted zombies are called 'rot-walkers' and carry cackle fever. The disease is so potent that even a small incursion at the outskirts of a town can seal the fate of its castle's garrison. Inevitably, a few wounded outrun the rot-walkers, fleeing to saftey. But once inside the walls, they begin to cough... cough and cackle. Soon, a third or more of the defenders are ill or dying. That's when the pack lord lets loose the war band. What was once impenetrable, now becomes an open feast with the weak and dead serving as garnish.": "当他们的战队靠近城堡或有围墙的城镇时，叶诺古的獠牙和芒格赫特会注意预兆。如果敌人的盾牌碎了，或者被杀的地精在被吃掉之前就腐烂了，他们就把尸体放在一边。那天晚上，他们举行了一个黑暗的仪式，让死人复活，耶诺古用不同的武器来保佑他们：疾病。这些病态的僵尸被称为 \"腐尸\"，并携带咯咯热。这种疾病是如此强大，以至于即使在一个城镇的郊区发生小规模的入侵，也能决定其城堡驻军的命运。不可避免的是，一些伤员逃过了腐尸，逃到了安全的地方。但一旦进入城墙，他们就开始咳嗽......咳嗽和咯咯笑。很快，三分之一或更多的保卫者生病或死亡。这时，狼群领主释放了战队。曾经坚不可摧的地方，现在变成了一场公开的盛宴，弱者和死者都成了装饰品。",
	"Even though gnolls aren't known for cooperation, gnoll scouts are very good at picking up on cues and signals from other pack members. As a result, gnolls always scout in pairs and are much more skilled as a result.": "尽管地精并不以合作著称，但地精侦察员非常善于捕捉其他族群成员的线索和信号。因此，地精总是成双成对地进行侦察，并因此而更加熟练。",
	"Pack lords and huntmasters send scouts out far and wide to track elusive prey, spot caravans or find poorly defended populations. When they find a promising target, one of the pair rushes back to alert the war band. The other might actually be patient enough to wait. During the resulting bloodletting, a gnoll scout will usually hang back a little to get a better view of the battlefield and pick off those that flee.": "狼群领主和狩猎大师派出侦察员远赴各地，追踪难以捉摸的猎物，发现商队或寻找防守薄弱的人口。当他们发现一个有希望的目标时，其中一个就会赶回来提醒战队。另一个可能真的有足够的耐心去等待。在由此产生的流血冲突中，地精侦察员通常会稍稍后退，以获得更好的战场视野，并摘掉那些逃跑的人。",
	"Hellseekers are crafted using foul sorcery known only to Yugoloth lords--some point to Bubonix--and the remains of slain fiends. Hired out as servants to the powerful and foolish, they specialize in retrieving objects and enemies.": "地狱猎手是用只有尤戈洛斯领主才知道的肮脏的巫术--有些人指向布博尼克斯--和被杀的恶魔的残骸制作的。他们被雇为有权有势和愚蠢的人的仆人，专门负责取回物品和敌人。",
	"Their unwavering determination makes hellseekers valuable (and expensive) fiends to summon. The requisite ritual temporarily binds a hellseeker to the summoner. During this time, it relentlessly pursues commands until it completes them or is destroyed.": "他们坚定不移的决心使得地狱追寻者成为有价值的（也是昂贵的）召唤魔物。必要的仪式会暂时将地狱追寻者与召唤者绑定。在这段时间里，它无情地追求命令，直到完成它们或被摧毁。",
	"It's thought that the hellseeker was modeled after the belberith; there are similarities: a surprisingly quick, elephant-sized spider, with a thick carapace and multiple gem-like eyes. (Four eyes are smaller and capable of producing devastating magical rays.) The hellseeker's four rearmost limbs carry all its weight. The front four end in cleaver-like blades, which aren't for walking. The hellseeker's mandibles and fangs look terrifying, but usually just collect what it was sent to fetch.": "人们认为地狱猎手是以belberith为原型的；有一些相似之处：一个令人惊讶的快速、大象大小的蜘蛛，有厚厚的甲壳和多个宝石般的眼睛。(四只眼睛较小，能够产生毁灭性的魔法射线。) 地狱猎手最后面的四只肢体承担了它所有的重量。前面的四条肢体末端是像菜刀一样的刀片，这不是用来走路的。地狱猎手的下颚和獠牙看起来很可怕，但通常只是收集它被派去取的东西。",
	"Oozes are porous, absorbing nearly everything they come into contact with. This also seems to apply to psionic emanations, which can result in bizarre mutations. Because of this, there are a variety oozes that have gained psionic abilities. Broadly known as psionic oozes, those that develop talents complimenting their protean form--most notably, metamorphosis into creatures similar to those with potent psionic powers--are known as mutable oozes.": "渗出物是多孔的，几乎能吸收它们接触到的所有东西。这似乎也适用于幻觉的散发，这可能会导致奇怪的变异。正因为如此，有多种ozes获得了幻觉能力。广义上讲，那些被称为 \"幻觉 \"的渗虫，发展出与它们的蛋白质形态相称的天赋--最明显的是，蜕变成与那些具有强大幻觉能力的生物相似的生物--被称为可变异渗虫。",
	"Whatever the source of their mutation, mutable oozes usually wait for prey, hidden on rocky ledges, on dark cavern ceilings, in thickets or underwater in weed beds. Their limited intelligence makes them smart enough to supplement hunting by tending available food like mosses or oysters by clearing away predators. Sometimes, psionically powerful beings will capture and employ them as guardians.": "不管它们的变异来源是什么，可变异乌贼通常都在等待猎物，隐藏在岩石壁架上、黑暗的洞穴天花板上、灌木丛中或水下的杂草床中。它们有限的智力使它们足够聪明，可以通过清理掠食者来照顾可用的食物，如苔藓或牡蛎，从而补充狩猎。有时，具有强大幻觉能力的生物会捕获并雇用它们作为守护者。",
	"An ooze doesn't require air or sleep, even if its additional form would seem to need both.": "渗出物不需要空气或睡眠，即使它的附加形式似乎需要这两者。",
	"Penanggalans result from dark sacrifices meant to stave off the torments of the next life. The right ritual rewards the suppliant with undeath. In this way, a servant has time to collect more souls to pay off a debt or gain status with its fiendish master.": "Penanggalans来自黑暗的祭祀，旨在避免来世的折磨。正确的仪式会给供奉者以不死的回报。这样一来，仆人就有时间收集更多的灵魂来偿还债务或在恶魔般的主人那里获得地位。",
	"A blood-drinking undead creature of great power and horrifying appearance, the penanggalan masquerades as a one of the living during the day, typically resembling and acting as it once was. In this form, it may act cordial, but it is soulless and incapable of genuine warmth. Any display of affection will likely infurate this horror and encourage it to target the offender the next night.": "饮血的不死生物具有强大的力量和可怕的外表，白天伪装成活人，通常与它曾经的样子相似，并表现得很像。在这种形式下，它可能会表现得很亲切，但它没有灵魂，也不可能有真正的热情。任何感情的展示都可能会激怒这种恐怖的东西，并促使它在第二天晚上把犯罪者当作目标。",
	"As soon as night falls, the masquerading undead assumes its true form. Its body goes limp, its head detaches and then rises into the air. It's eyes glow faintly as it flies off in search of a victim to feast upon. Adding to the horror, the creature's entrails hang from the head's base, slick with acidic poison. As it flies, it sometimes whispers the vile secrets, hellish curses and debasing torments that only this abomination would know.": "一旦夜幕降临，伪装的亡灵就会显现出它的真实形态。它的身体瘫痪了，它的头脱离了，然后升到空中。它的眼睛发出微弱的光芒，飞去寻找可以大吃的受害者。更加恐怖的是，这个生物的内脏挂在头的底部，沾满了酸性的毒液。当它飞翔时，它有时会低声诉说卑鄙的秘密、地狱般的诅咒和贬低的折磨，只有这种憎恶才会知道。",
	"When a suitable victim is found, the penanggalan will fly through open windows or melt into a disgusting ooze to crawl in through small gaps. It then charms sleeping prey, and uses its fang-filled mouth to make several, small punctures in a hard to notice spot. It quietly feasts on the victim's blood. (The penanggalan rarely attacks someone that's awake, only if its body or lair are threatened.) If the victim survives a feeding, he or she will remember nothing, only disturbingly ominous dreams.": "当找到一个合适的受害者时，penanggalan会从打开的窗户飞进去，或者融化成恶心的泥浆，从小缝隙中爬进去。然后，它对睡着的猎物施展魅力，用它充满獠牙的嘴在难以察觉的地方刺出几个小洞。它静静地享用着受害者的血液。(penanggalan很少攻击清醒的人，只有当它的身体或巢穴受到威胁时才会攻击。) 如果受害者在进食后幸存下来，他或她将什么都不记得，只记得令人不安的不祥之梦。",
	"To prevent such attacks, some have found that the penanggalan is warded off by thick vegetation, especially thorny plants. Vibrant vegetation is abhorant to the abomination, but it also slashes and snags it.": "为了防止这种攻击，有些人发现penanggalan被厚厚的植被挡住了，特别是有刺的植物。生机勃勃的植被让可恶的人感到厌恶，但也会砍伤和卡住它。",
	"Many of a penanggalan's victims rise as simple ghouls -- bound to protect its lair and body as it hunts. But if the penanggalan is slain, remaining ghouls are released. The first to drink the blood of an innocent is given the chance to become a penanggalan with the other ghouls as servants. As a result, adventurers that fail to do their research and take precautions could face the same foe all over again.": "许多penanggalan的受害者变成了简单的食尸鬼--在它捕猎的时候被束缚着保护它的巢穴和身体。但如果penanggalan被杀，剩下的食尸鬼就会被释放。第一个喝了无辜者的血的人有机会成为penanggalan，其他食尸鬼则成为仆人。因此，冒险者如果不做研究并采取预防措施，可能会再次面临同样的敌人。",
	"Penanggalans are understandably secretive creatures who make their lairs in mines, ruins, crypts, underground dungeons, or other abandoned buildings or structures. Their lairs are always protected by traps and ghoul servitors to kill or frighten off intruders. Inside a lair, its headless body appears to be merely a well-preserved, decapitated corpse. However, any that have the nerve to examine the neck will see that the body cavity is hollow and dessicated. If not already alerted by traps, the penanggalan will \"know\" when intruders reach its body. This is the only occasion when it'll attempt to destroy a conscious enemy.": "佩南加兰人是一种可以理解的神秘生物，他们在矿井、废墟、地窖、地下城或其他废弃的建筑或结构中建立自己的巢穴。他们的巢穴总是由陷阱和食尸鬼仆人保护，以杀死或吓跑入侵者。在巢穴内，它的无头尸体看起来只是一具保存完好的被砍掉头的尸体。然而，任何有胆量检查颈部的人都会看到，体腔是空洞的，而且是干枯的。如果没有被陷阱惊动，当入侵者到达它的身体时，penanggalan会 \"知道\"。这是唯一的机会，它将试图摧毁一个有意识的敌人。",
	"Near the body, there is always a basin filled with an herbinfused vinegar. When the head returns, it must soak its entrails in the bath to shrink them enough to fit back inside its body and restore its dissimulating appearance. If sunlight strikes a penanggalan's head when it is separated from the body, the head will be paralyzed and fall helplessly to the ground. If not reunited within a few hours after sunrise, head and body will rapidly rot away. Therefore, a penanggalan will always rush to return to its lair well before dawn.": "在身体附近，总是有一个装满草药醋的盆子。当头颅回来时，它必须把它的内脏浸泡在浴盆里，使它们缩小到足以装回身体里，并恢复其异样的外观。当penanggalan与身体分离时，如果阳光照射到它的头部，头部就会麻痹，无力地倒在地上。如果不在日出后的几个小时内重聚，头部和身体会迅速腐烂。因此，penanggalan总是会在黎明前赶回它的巢穴。",
	"When the head and body are joined, detect evil and good, divine sense and similar magics will not reveal its undead nature. Similarly, the 'living form' is immune and does not react to holy symbols and undead turning. The body is as it was in life, with none of the penangugalan's undead traits. However, despite the versimilitude of life, the head maintains all of its damage resistance, damage immunities and condition immunities and is unaffected by damage to the body.": "当头部和身体结合在一起时，侦测邪恶和善良、神识和类似的魔法将不会显示其不死的本质。同样地，\"活体 \"对神圣的符号和亡灵的转变也是免疫的，没有反应。身体就像生前一样，没有任何penangugalan的亡灵特征。然而，尽管有生命的多面性，头部仍然保持着所有的抗伤害能力、伤害免疫和条件免疫，并且不受身体受损的影响。",
	"A penanggalan doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "一个penanggalan不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The thirsting death is a malevolent, vaporous creature that feeds on the blood of the living. Its pale gray or white form and the indistinct humanoid shape at its center are difficult to distinguish from fog or clouds.": "饥渴的死神是一种邪恶的，以活人的血为食的蒸气生物。它苍白的灰色或白色的外形，以及其中心模糊不清的人形，很难从雾或云中分辨出来。",
	"The secretive thirsting death dwells wherever fog and pockets of darkness prevail, but prefers bogs and marshes. Lairs are usually in caves, crevaces or areas with thick underbrush blocking the sun.": "隐秘的渴死鬼居住在任何有雾和有黑暗的地方，但更喜欢沼泽和沼泽。巢穴通常在山洞、裂缝或有浓密灌木遮挡阳光的地方。",
	"Extemely reticent, it is, however, still capable of speech. Its voice is a series of barely audible whispers, no louder than a soft breeze. Its words are reserved for making alliances, preferably ones that provide a steady supply of victims.": "它极其沉默寡言，但仍有能力说话。它的声音是一连串几乎听不到的耳语，不比一阵轻风大。它的话语是用来结盟的，最好是那些能提供稳定的受害者的联盟。",
	"It typically consumes one victim per week. Intelligent and cautious, it uses treasure it collects to lure victims, preferably solitary. If several are present, the thirsting death tries to pick off the guard while the rest sleep.": "它通常每周吞噬一名受害者。它聪明而谨慎，利用它收集的财宝来引诱受害者，最好是单独行动。如果有几个人在场，饥渴的死神会试图在其他人睡觉时挑掉守卫。",
	"The thirsting death is capable of lifting any object it surrounds, including dead victims. This allows it to conceal its presence by disposing of corpses in its lair or a deep bog.": "饥渴的死神能够提升它周围的任何物体，包括死去的受害者。这使得它可以通过在巢穴或深沼泽中处理尸体来掩盖其存在。",
	"When it feeds, the vapor takes on an easily noticed wine-colored hue. At the same time, the center of the cloud darkens and takes on a much more solid, skeleton-like form. If a thirsting death dies, it immediately dissipates while any undigested blood rains down in a grotesque shower.": "当它进食时，水汽呈现出容易注意到的葡萄酒色泽。同时，云的中心会变暗，并呈现出更坚实的、类似骨架的形式。如果渴死了，它就会立即消散，而任何未消化的血液都会以怪异的雨滴形式落下。",
	"The thirsting death's traits have led sages to theorize that it is actually the result of the death or partial destruction of a vampire. Others believer that, when a vampire is created, its soul is reborn elsewhere as a crimson death. Some legends says that the vampire may be restored to normal life if it is rejoined with its thirsting death counterpart.": "渴死的特征使圣人理论上认为它实际上是吸血鬼死亡或部分毁灭的结果。还有人相信，当一个吸血鬼被创造出来时，它的灵魂会在其他地方重生，成为深红色的死亡。一些传说说，如果吸血鬼与它的渴死对应物重新结合，就可以恢复正常生活。",
	"A thirsting death doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "渴死的人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"An undying heresy is the undead spirit of an evil priest or sage who died with at least one important, and usually contentious, doctrinal question unresolved. Its spectral form is frozen by its evil contemplations, devoting all of its energy to solving the mystery. It takes no interest in its surroundings. Nothing moves or rouses it, only destruction.": "不死的异端是一个邪恶的牧师或圣人的不死之魂，他死后至少有一个重要的、通常是有争议的教义问题没有解决。它的幽灵形态被其邪恶的沉思所冻结，将其所有的能量都用于解开这个谜团。它对周围的环境毫无兴趣。没有任何东西能打动它或唤醒它，只有毁灭。",
	"The undying heresy is only found in isolated locations, especially the ruins of temples, libraries, monasteries or other places of learning. It appears as a seated, insubstantial figure swathed in slate-colored robes. Orbiting it are tiny, wispy creatures known as anticreeds. They look similar, but sport spindly, wicked claws. These acrimonious creatures eagerly attack the living and are actually the heresy's evil thoughts. They dwell within the heresy's aura, which grows, spreading outward every century.": "不死的异端只在孤立的地方被发现，特别是寺庙、图书馆、修道院或其他学习场所的废墟。它出现时是一个坐着的、没有实体的身影，披着石板色的长袍。围绕着它运行的是微小的、飘忽不定的生物，被称为anticreeds。它们看起来很相似，但却长着细长而邪恶的爪子。这些尖锐的生物热切地攻击活人，实际上是异端的邪恶思想。它们居住在异端的光环中，光环不断增长，每个世纪都向外扩散。",
	"Certain theologians speculate that powerful evil clerics who, at death, become undying heresies may have been attempting to become demigods. It is feared that after at least 1,000 years, a few manage to resolve their philosophical dilemmas, leading them to transcend the material world and become profoundly evil, immortal beings. Sages urge those who discover a heresy to destroy it immediately, in case the frightening theory has merit.": "某些神学家推测，强大的邪恶教士在死亡时成为不朽的异端，可能是试图成为半神。人们担心在至少1000年后，少数人设法解决了他们的哲学困境，导致他们超越物质世界，成为深刻的邪恶、不朽的生命。圣人敦促那些发现异端的人立即摧毁它，以防这个可怕的理论有可取之处。",
	"A undying heresy and its anticreeds don't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "一个不死的异端和它的反叛者不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。"
