	"If an enemy is within 45 feet of the gronk, the gronk can increase its speed to 45 feet and use its movement to hop toward that enemy, moving normally through other creatures' spaces or difficult terrain. If it finishes this movement next to the original enemy and makes a spiked headplate atack against it, the gronk has advantage on the attack roll.": "如果一个敌人在地龙的45英尺范围内，地龙可以将它的速度提高到45英尺，并使用它的移动来跳向那个敌人，在其他生物的空间或困难地形中正常移动。如果它在原来的敌人旁边完成这个移动，并对其进行尖头盔攻击，那么地龙在攻击卷上有优势。",
	"A gronk has disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that involve hearing, but has advantage on saving throws that require it to hear another creature.": "土拨鼠在涉及听觉的智慧检查中处于劣势，但是在需要它听到另一个生物的声音时，它的拯救动作具有优势。",
	"{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 5}击中，到达5英尺，一个目标。{@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3})穿刺伤害。如果目标是一个生物，它必须在一个{@dc 13}的力量反射中成功，或者被击倒{@condition prone}。",
	"Huge, squat beasts with powerful legs and a thundering croak, the gronk are also known as \"hopping rocks\" or \"stone frogs.\" The ill-tempered beasts pose a threat to the nomadic bariaur tribes that roam the Outlands, and those tribes occasionally mount hunting parties solely to thin the gronk's numbers. According to the bariaur nomads, gronk have existed on the Outlands for as far back as five bariaur generations. Their numbers have not increased substantially during that time, mostly due to bariaur thinning gronk herds with their rites of passage. A number of planewalkers have sighted the gronk on several Prime worlds as well.": "巨大的、蹲着的野兽，有着强有力的腿和雷鸣般的呱呱声，格隆克也被称为 \"跳岩 \"或 \"石蛙\"。这些脾气不好的野兽对游荡在外域的巴里亚尔游牧部落构成了威胁，这些部落偶尔会组建狩猎队，只为减少格隆克的数量。根据巴里亚尔游牧民族的说法，格朗克在外域已经存在了五代巴里亚尔人。在那段时间里，他们的数量并没有大幅增加，主要是由于巴里亚尔人通过他们的成年仪式稀释了格朗克的数量。一些行尸走肉者在几个主世界也看到了格隆克。",
	"When a creature comes within its line of sight, a gronk emits a thundering croak and hops toward the target to smash it to death with its spiked headplate. All gronk are nearly deaf, and bright visual displays irritate them. Tales tell of wizards who cast {@spell dancing lights} into gronk herds to drive them into a frenzy. This results in the gronk turning on themselves until nearly every member of the herd is dead.": "当一个生物进入它的视线范围时，地龙会发出雷鸣般的呱呱声，然后跳向目标，用它的带刺头盔将其砸死。所有的高隆克人几乎都是聋子，明亮的视觉显示会刺激他们。传说中，巫师会向高隆克群施放{@spell dancing lights}，使其陷入狂热状态。这样做的结果是高隆克自相残杀，直到几乎所有的成员都死了。",
	"The gronk are so ill tempered that they can't even tolerate their own species. Despite their herd mentality, the strength of the herd depends on the gronk's emotional cycle, and members of a new herd can survive for a week at most before becoming irritated with one another. Soon after, their natural hatred gives way to furious bouts of head smashing. The herd then dissolves and reforms into new herds several months later.": "格朗克人的脾气很差，甚至不能容忍自己的同类。尽管它们有群居的心态，但群居的力量取决于高隆克的情绪周期，一个新群居的成员最多可以生存一周，然后就会互相激怒。不久之后，他们的自然仇恨就会让位于愤怒的打头阵。兽群随后解散，并在几个月后重组为新的兽群。",
	"Ironically, the gronk's hatred of each other propagates their species. A gronk's reproductive organs are located near its brain, in the spiked carapace over its forehead. The ridged spikes that cover the gronk's headplate are actually buds that exchange reproductive material when two gronk smash their heads into each other, then subsequently fall off. If a fallen bud touches dirt, sand, earth, or rock, it submerges a few inches beneath the ground, only to burrow forth a few months later as a tiny gronk.": "具有讽刺意味的是，格朗克人相互间的憎恨繁殖了它们的物种。地龙的生殖器官位于它的大脑附近，在它额头上的尖头壳里。覆盖在地龙头盔上的脊状尖刺实际上是花蕾，当两只地龙的头互相碰撞时，它们会交换生殖物质，然后随后掉落。如果掉落的花蕾接触到泥土、沙子、土壤或岩石，它就会淹没在地面下几英寸，几个月后才会钻出来，成为一个小高隆。",
	"The gronk have never been seen to eat; it is a mystery how they sustain themselves. A gronk's lifespan ranges from three to five years. As a gronk ages, its headplate cracks and flakes off until the creature suffers brain failure and dies.": "从来没有人见过竹节虫吃东西；它们如何维持自己的生命是一个谜。高脚龙的寿命为三至五年。随着地龙的衰老，它的头盔会裂开并剥落，直到该生物遭受大脑衰竭而死亡。",
	"Gronk headplates are often sought after for use in creating shields and armor plating, including for siege towers and shield walls. One bariaur myth talks of gronk headplates being placed upon an enchanted battering ram that could act as a {@item horn of blasting} upon any structure, but which needed a huge number of people to carry it.": "高隆克头板经常被用来制作盾牌和装甲，包括用于攻城塔和盾墙。一个巴里亚尔人的神话说，高隆克人的头板被放在一个被施了魔法的撞锤上，这个撞锤可以作为一个{@item horn of blasting}的结构，但需要大量的人去搬运它。",
	"The gronk also have bladder-like glands along their necks and upper backs that can be removed with care after a gronk is slain. When treated with the right resins and filled with acid, the gland sacs can be used as grenades, and are known to be extremely effective against fiends.": "格朗克人的脖子和上背部也有类似膀胱的腺体，在格朗克人被杀后，可以小心翼翼地取出来。当用合适的树脂处理并灌入酸液时，腺囊可以作为手榴弹使用，而且据说对恶魔非常有效。",
	"The grillig makes four talons attacks.": "格里格做了四个爪子的攻击。",

	"Grilligs are small, scaled beasts with long arms and hunched legs. Their movement resembles that of gorillas, as they use their arms to propel themselves along. Grilligs are vicious pests and can be lethal if they encounter an expedition unprepared for them.": "灰猪是小型的、有鳞的野兽，有长长的手臂和驼背的腿。它们的动作类似于大猩猩，因为它们用手臂来推动自己前进。Grilligs是邪恶的害虫，如果它们遇到没有准备好的探险队，可能是致命的。",
	"Legend has it that grilligs were born from twodimensional angles. But whatever their origin, they are strangely resistant to arrows, spears, swords, and other edged weapons. They can be found in almost any rugged, angular terrain. Chasms, caves, and mountainous areas have been known to run thick with them.": "传说中，烤猪是从二维角度诞生的。但无论其起源如何，它们对箭、矛、剑和其他有棱角的武器都有奇怪的抵抗力。它们几乎可以在任何崎岖、有棱角的地形中找到。峡谷、山洞和山区都有它们的身影。",
	"Grilligs have a pack mentality, and their society revolves around finding something larger and meaner than themselves, killing it, and then moving onto a larger, meaner creature. They prefer to weaken a target with ambushes or crude traps (pushing boulders off ledges, causing avalanches, stampeding other creatures over the victim, and so on). They then attack in groups, raising themselves on their forelimbs to lash out with their foot talons, and shredding targets with lightning speed.": "Grilligs有一种群体心态，他们的社会围绕着寻找比自己更大、更卑鄙的东西，杀死它，然后转移到一个更大、更卑鄙的生物身上。它们更喜欢用伏击或粗糙的陷阱来削弱目标（将巨石推下壁架，造成雪崩，让其他生物踩在受害者身上，等等）。然后它们成群结队地进攻，用前肢抬起自己，用脚爪猛击，以闪电般的速度撕碎目标。",
	"If all except one member of a grillig pack is killed, the remaining grillig either flees combat or joins another group of grilligs. If cornered before it can flee, a lone grillig hisses and gnashes its teeth, but it does not defend itself from attackers.": "如果一个格力犬群中除了一个成员被杀，剩下的格力犬要么逃离战斗，要么加入另一个格力犬群。如果在逃跑之前被逼到了墙角，孤独的格瑞格会发出嘶嘶声并咬牙切齿，但它不会保护自己免受攻击。",
	"It is not known how grilligs breed—more of them simply seem to appear whenever their numbers become too thin. The bariaur root out these pests whenever they find them, but no matter how many they kill, more appear in the later seasons. If actively hunted, the grilligs lie low for a while, then emerge when the hunters relax their guard. Members of bariaur tribes on the Outlands always carry bludgeoning weapons against the threat of a grillig attack.": "不知道烤猪是如何繁殖的--只要它们的数量变得太少，就会出现更多的烤猪。只要发现这些害虫，Bariaur就会把它们连根拔起，但不管他们杀了多少，在以后的季节里会出现更多。如果被积极猎杀，烤猪就会低调一阵子，然后在猎人放松警惕时出现。外围地区的巴里亚尔部落成员总是携带打击性武器，以应对格力格攻击的威胁。",
	"A grillig's teeth and talons can be used in the creation of magic armor as well as magic arrowheads and spearheads. It is said that secret rituals can give certain weapons the \"speed of a grillig,\" allowing the wielder of the weapon to make a frenzy of multiple attacks.": "格里格的牙齿和爪子可以用来制造魔法盔甲，以及魔法箭头和矛头。据说，秘密仪式可以赋予某些武器以 \"格力格的速度\"，使武器持有者能够进行疯狂的多重攻击。",
	"When six or more sohmien enter combat together in an environment of dim light or darkness, each creature that can see the stampede must succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature that is riding a mount has advantage on this saving throw.": "当六个或更多的索米恩在昏暗的光线或黑暗的环境中一起进入战斗时，每个能看到踩踏的生物必须在一个{@dc 11}的智慧救赎中成功，否则会被{@condition frightened}，持续1分钟。骑马的生物在这个蓄力动作上有优势。",
	"The sohmien makes one gore attack and one bite attack. If either attack hits, it can also make a hooves attack. Alternatively, the sohmien can make three spines attacks.": "Sohmien可以进行一次血肉攻击和一次咬人攻击。如果任何一次攻击命中，它还可以进行一次蹄子攻击。或者，苏米恩可以进行三次刺杀攻击。",

	"A sohmien resembles a huge horse with a leathery, ashen hide and dead white eyes. Its shoulder blades extend beyond its head and neck, and bone spikes (extensions of its spinal column) sprout from each shoulder.": "Sohmien类似于一匹巨大的马，有着皮革般灰暗的皮肤和死白的眼睛。它的肩胛骨延伸到头部和颈部之外，骨刺（脊柱的延伸）从每个肩膀上长出来。",
	"Sohmiens leave a trail of mist in their wake, resembling that which shrouds the Hinterlands. The touch of their hooves kills vegetation and can taint the lands they stampede across for years. No one has ever successfully used a sohmien as a mount.": "Sohmiens在它们的身后留下了一连串的迷雾，就像笼罩在腹地的迷雾一样。它们的蹄子会杀死植被，并会在它们踩过的土地上留下多年的污点。从来没有人成功地将苏米恩作为坐骑。",
	"Sohmien do not eat, sleep, or mate, and their rides are governed by some cycle that eludes scholars. Herds of them emerge from the Hinterlands randomly before returning, and many suspect that they appear only in response to a creature craving vengeance.": "Sohmien不吃饭、不睡觉、不交配，他们的骑行是由一些学者无法理解的周期所支配的。它们成群结队地从腹地随机出现，然后再返回，许多人怀疑它们的出现只是为了回应一种渴望复仇的生物。",
	"According to legend, the last of the nightmare lords was lured to the Gloom Meet by his subjects, then attacked by fiends who had tired of bartering for permission to use his nightmares. The nightmare lord was driven into the Hinterlands, his body riddled by cold iron spears and arrows. It is believed that where his blood struck the earth, sohmien sprang forth.": "根据传说，最后一位噩梦领主被他的臣民引诱到阴霾之城，然后被那些厌倦了为使用他的噩梦而进行交易的恶魔袭击。恶梦领主被赶到腹地，他的身体被冰冷的铁矛和箭矢刺穿。人们相信，在他的血液撞击大地的地方，就会出现苏米恩。",
	"Sohmien hate nightmares and attack them over all other targets. It is said that the ride of the sohmien will not end until they kill every nightmare in existence.": "Sohmien憎恨恶梦，攻击恶梦胜过所有其他目标。据说，索米恩的旅程不会结束，直到他们杀死存在的每一个噩梦。",
	"Sohmien prefer to start combat at range with their shoulder spines, each of which makes a horrible whistling noise when fired and shrieks when it tastes blood. In close-up combat, a sohmien gores and bites its foes in non-vital areas, allowing a creature to experience as much pain as possible before its eventual death.": "Sohmien喜欢用他们的肩刺开始战斗，每根肩刺在发射时都会发出可怕的呼啸声，当它尝到血腥味时就会发出尖叫。在近距离战斗中，Sohmien会在非重要部位对敌人进行撕咬，让生物在最终死亡前尽可能多地体验痛苦。",
	"According to myth, sohmien are creatures of vengeance. They can be summoned by any vengeful mage or priest of sufficient power through a long-lost ritual called the sohmien pact. When summoned, sohmien must be ordered to ride, destroying all in the path leading to the creature that has wronged the summoner.": "根据神话，苏米恩是复仇的生物。任何具有足够力量的复仇法师或牧师都可以通过一种失传已久的仪式召唤它们，这种仪式被称为 \"索米恩契约\"。当被召唤时，索米恩必须被命令骑马，摧毁所有通向对召唤者不利的生物的道路。",
	"The ride ends only when all the sohmien are slain or when they have reduced the offending creature to near death. At that point, the sohmien wait, pawing the ground in the hope that their victim will seek its own revenge by sending them stampeding back to the first summoner. What happens when the sohmien return is unknown, but chronicles talk of the original summoner vanishing, its voice joining the frightful wails that follow the sohmien as they ride from the Hinterlands.": "只有当所有的sohmien都被杀死，或者当他们把违规的生物减少到接近死亡的时候，骑行才会结束。这时，sohmien会等待，用爪子拍打地面，希望他们的受害者会通过让他们返回第一个召唤者那里来寻求自己的报复。索米恩回来后会发生什么不得而知，但编年史中提到最初的召唤者消失了，它的声音加入了索米恩离开腹地时的可怕哀嚎。",
	"To any creature more than 30 feet away from the trelon, the trelon is {@condition invisible} and makes no sound. This invisibility cannot be overcome by any mundane or magical means.": "对于任何距离trelon超过30英尺的生物来说，trelon是{@condition invisible}并且不发出任何声音。这种隐身性不能被任何世俗或魔法手段所克服。",
	"The trelon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "特雷隆在对抗法术和其他魔法效果时有优势。",

	"Trelons have been described as a \"mixture of orange and shadow.\" They have two long arms that end in curved spikes, two mandibles near the mouth for feeding, and two spindly legs. According to legend, trelons were created to exterminate mages on some long-dead Prime world. True or not, the trelons seem to hate mages and magic in general.": "特雷隆被描述为 \"橙色和阴影的混合物\"。它们有两条长长的手臂，末端是弯曲的尖刺，嘴巴附近有两个用于进食的下颚，还有两条细长的腿。根据传说，trelons是为了消灭某个早已消亡的主世界的法师而创造的。无论真假，trelons似乎讨厌法师和一般的魔法。",
	"A trelon swarm is terrible to behold. When they appear, they mob any nearby creature, tearing through their victims like scythes. Trelons attack with their two arm spikes, bisecting a target like a pair of cutting shears. They do not stop until they have killed every non-trelon in sight, but when the fight is done, the mandibles around their mouths scoop up the remains of their victims.": "特雷龙群是可怕的。当它们出现时，它们会围攻附近的任何生物，像镰刀一样撕碎它们的受害者。特雷隆人用他们的两根手臂上的尖刺进行攻击，像一把剪子一样将目标一分为二。直到它们杀死了眼前的每一个非特莱龙，它们才会停下来，但当战斗结束后，它们嘴边的下颚会把受害者的残骸挖出来。",
	"Trelons do not like natural light, and torches or strong lanterns can prevent them from attacking. However, magical light drives them into a frenzy, and they attack any opponent using it without hesitation.": "特雷隆人不喜欢自然光，火把或强光灯可以阻止他们的攻击。然而，魔法光会使它们陷入狂热，它们会毫不犹豫地攻击任何使用魔法的对手。",
	"A trelon never appears at a distance of greater than 30 feet from other creatures. Targets might thus never know that they are in the middle of a swarm of trelons until the creatures suddenly begin to materialize. How this ability works remains a mystery, but trelons are known to appear primarily in shadowy conditions where there is no natural light. It is likewise not known where they retreat to once they have finished their attacks.": "特雷隆永远不会出现在距离其他生物超过30英尺的地方。因此，目标可能永远不知道他们正处于trelon群中，直到这些生物突然开始出现。这种能力是如何运作的仍然是个谜，但已知trelons主要出现在没有自然光的阴暗环境中。同样，也不知道它们在完成攻击后会撤退到哪里。",
	"Some believe that the trelons track creatures by their shadows, their emotions, or the sounds they make. But it is also known that trelons have the ability to track a victim through the use of spells or magic items designed to conceal the user. They are drawn to those protected by {@spell invisibility}, a {@item cloak of displacement}, and similar magic, and can sense targets no matter how well they are hidden. Magical cloaking seems to drive trelons into a rage, and they often attack {@condition invisible} or cloaked targets before other foes.": "有些人认为，trelons通过他们的影子、他们的情绪或他们发出的声音来追踪生物。但人们也知道，trelons有能力通过使用旨在隐藏使用者的法术或魔法物品来追踪受害者。它们被那些受（%0%）、（%1%）和类似魔法保护的人所吸引，无论目标藏得多好，它们都能感觉到。魔法隐身似乎会使特雷隆人陷入愤怒，他们经常在其他敌人之前攻击（%2%）或隐身的目标。",
	"Trelons speak a unique language that consists of soft clicks and chittering noises, which rise to a near-deafening screeching when they strike. Their insect-like nature makes several sages suspect that they may have a hive mentality, but like much that is known about trelons, this is only speculation.": "特雷隆人讲一种独特的语言，由轻柔的咔嚓声和抖动的声音组成，当他们攻击时，会发出近乎震耳欲聋的尖叫声。它们像昆虫一样的性质使一些圣人怀疑它们可能有一种蜂巢心态，但就像对特雷隆的许多了解一样，这只是猜测。",
	"Trelons are valued for their talons, which are long enough to be used as sword blades and make fearsome mage-slaying weapons when properly enchanted. Likewise, trelon blood is said to be usable in the crafting of unique {@item arrow of slaying (generic)|dmg|arrows of slaying} meant to kill mages. But incidents have been recorded in which attempts to use trelon blood in magical rituals have instead summoned a swarm of trelons to the scene.": "特雷隆的价值在于它们的爪子，它们的爪子足够长，可以作为剑刃使用，如果被适当施以魔法，可以成为可怕的杀戮法师的武器。同样地，据说特雷隆的血也可以用来制作独特的（%0%）旨在杀死法师的武器。但也有记录显示，试图在魔法仪式中使用特雷隆的血，反而会召唤出成群的特雷隆来。"
