His face is so beautiful it has made grown men weep, even when it is crossed by lines of fear or worry. His lithe body is heavily muscled, belying the speed and grace with which he moves. His eyes, always blue, are sky blue when he is at peace and the deep blue of a storm tossed sea when he is angry.": "白天，迪亚玛贝尔是一个天使般的美景。他苍白的皮肤和带羽毛的翅膀散发着神圣的光芒。他的头发是银色的，反射着日出或日落的光芒。他的脸庞是如此美丽，以至于让成年男子流泪，即使它被恐惧或担忧的线条划过。他轻巧的身体上有大量的肌肉，掩盖了他行动的速度和优雅。他的眼睛总是蓝色的，当他平静的时候是天蓝色的，当他愤怒的时候则是风暴翻滚的大海的深蓝色。",
	"At night, Diamabel undergoes a horrific transformation. He loses his radiance and deep gashes crisscross his skin, weeping thick drops of black blood, with the bone underneath showing through. His eyes explode, leaving him with empty eye sockets. The feathers in his wings fall out, and the skin rots, leaving only thin bones. Despite the loss of his feathers, Diamabel can still fly.": "到了晚上，迪亚玛尔经历了一次可怕的转变。他失去了光芒，皮肤上纵横交错着深深的伤痕，流淌着浓浓的黑血，下面的骨头都露出来了。他的眼睛爆炸了，留下了空洞的眼窝。他翅膀上的羽毛脱落，皮肤腐烂，只剩下薄薄的骨头。尽管失去了羽毛，迪亚玛贝尔仍然可以飞行。",
	"Diamabel was born to rule. He was the son of a sheikh of a powerful tribe of nomads. The nomads controlled important trade routes through the desert and served as guides and protectors for the giant merchant caravans that crossed the desert from the sea to the wealthy cities. When Diamabel was a child, his nursemaid would tell him stories of her far away homeland. In her land, people chosen by the gods were turned into pillars of pure light and taken away to live with their deities for all eternity. At the young age of five, Diamabel knew the path he would tread in life.": "迪马贝尔生来就是为了统治。他是一个强大的游牧民族部落的酋长的儿子。游牧民族控制着穿越沙漠的重要贸易路线，为从海上穿越沙漠到富裕城市的巨大商队充当向导和保护者。当迪亚玛贝尔还是个孩子时，他的奶妈会给他讲她遥远的家乡的故事。在她的土地上，被众神选中的人被变成纯洁的光柱，并被带去与他们的神灵一起生活，直到永远。在五岁的时候，迪亚玛贝尔就知道他将踏上人生的道路。",
	"As Diamabel grew into manhood he became an accomplished warrior and tactician. He was famed for his devastating night raids on enemy nomad tribes and the caravans they protected. Diamabel always looked beyond the desert, to the seats of the gods and swore one day he would be with them. Diamabel's father had no time for this nonsense. Protecting his people and letting them prosper was his only concern. Time and again Diamabel tried to convince his father that he should follow a heavenly path, but Diamabel's entreaties failed. Diamabel had more success with the rest of his tribe, most of whom began to worship Diamabel. As Diamabel grew older, his relationship with his father became more and more laboured.": "随着迪亚玛贝尔长大成人，他成为一名出色的战士和战术家。他以对敌方游牧部落和他们保护的商队进行毁灭性的夜袭而闻名。迪马贝尔总是把目光投向沙漠之外，投向众神的席位，并发誓有一天他将与众神在一起。迪亚马贝尔的父亲没有时间听这些废话。保护他的人民，让他们繁荣昌盛是他唯一关心的问题。迪亚马贝尔一次又一次地试图说服他的父亲，他应该走天路，但迪亚马贝尔的恳求失败了。迪亚马贝尔在他的部落其他成员那里取得了更大的成功，他们中的大多数人开始崇拜迪亚马贝尔。随着迪亚玛贝尔年龄的增长，他与父亲的关系变得越来越紧张。",
	"When Diamabel was 16 his father suddenly died. Those in the tribe that whispered of poison or murder soon joined their sheikh in death. The tribe of nomads changed with Diamabel's leadership. They no longer protected caravans or raided enemy tribes for supplies and honor, now they were conquerors. Diamabel began to subjugate the nearby tribes. Any that didn't convert to his faith were put to the sword. The few members of Diamabel's tribe that didn't share his belief were slain as well. As Diamabel's power grew, he began to attack the coastal trading towns and wealthy cities that surrounded the desert, putting thousands to the sword, but it wasn't enough. At night, Diamabel would dream of becoming an angel in the service of his god, strong, with a fiery sword in one hand, and carried aloft on feathered wings. In the mornings, Diamabel would wake, still just a man. His frustration and anger drove him to even greater heights of savagery.": "在迪亚玛贝尔16岁时，他的父亲突然去世。部落里那些低声说毒药或谋杀的人很快就和他们的酋长一起死了。在迪亚玛贝尔的领导下，游牧民族的部落发生了变化。他们不再保护商队或突袭敌方部落以获取物资和荣誉，现在他们是征服者。迪马贝尔开始征服附近的部落。任何不皈依他的信仰的人都被处以刀刑。迪亚马贝尔部落中少数不认同他的信仰的成员也被杀了。随着迪亚玛贝尔力量的增长，他开始攻击沙漠周围的沿海贸易城镇和富裕城市，将成千上万的人置于刀下，但这还不够。晚上，迪亚玛贝尔会梦见自己成为一个为他的神服务的天使，身体强壮，一手握着一把火红的剑，用羽毛的翅膀高高举起。早晨，迪亚玛贝尔醒来，仍然只是一个人。他的挫折感和愤怒驱使他达到更高的野蛮境界。",
	"At the height of his power, Diamabel moved to raze a village on the edge of the desert, one of the few left that didn't worship his god. The village didn't have the numbers to openly resist, but archers hid in the houses, and took a terrible toll on men and horses. As Diamabel ordered his men to burn the village, an arrow was loosed, and tore its way into his torso.": "在他权力的巅峰时期，迪亚玛贝尔采取行动，夷平了沙漠边缘的一个村庄，那是仅存的几个不崇拜他的神的村庄之一。该村没有足够的人数进行公开抵抗，但弓箭手躲在房子里，对人和马造成了可怕的损失。当迪亚玛贝尔命令他的手下烧毁村庄时，一支箭被放了出来，并撕开了他的躯干。",
	"Diamabel fell from his horse and his most faithful servants surrounded him. Healers were summoned but Diamabel knew it was too late. The arrow had entered too deeply and the wound couldn't be staunched. Diamabel's blood seeped into the hot desert sands and he died. When Diamabel opened his eyes again, he had changed. The arrow was gone and Diamabel had become a perfect being too beautiful and tall to be a man.": "迪亚马贝尔从马背上摔下来，他最忠实的仆人围着他。医护人员被召来，但迪亚玛贝尔知道已经太晚了。箭插得太深，伤口无法止住。迪亚马贝尔的血渗入了炎热的沙漠沙地，他死了。当迪亚玛贝尔再次睁开眼睛时，他已经变了。箭头消失了，迪亚玛贝尔变成了一个完美的生命，他太漂亮了，太高大了，不可能是一个人。",
	"At first Diamabel was convinced his god had given him part of heaven to rule, but that belief only lasted until his first transformation. Now Diamabel believes his god is testing him, and with each passing day he grows less patient and forgiving.": "起初，迪亚玛贝尔相信他的神把天堂的一部分交给他统治，但这种信念只持续到他的第一次转变。现在，迪亚玛贝尔相信他的神在考验他，随着时间的推移，他越来越没有耐心和宽容。",
	"Diamabel is deeply conflicted. During the day he is a vision of angelic perfection, but his transformation at night troubles him. Diamabel has convinced himself that the heretics living in his lands keep him from becoming one with his god. Diamabel believes he has been too lenient with heretics in the past, and now takes advantage of his terrifying night form to hunt them down.": "迪亚玛贝尔深感矛盾。白天，他是一个完美的天使形象，但他在晚上的转变却让他烦恼。迪亚马贝尔使自己相信，生活在他的土地上的异教徒使他无法与他的神融为一体。迪马贝尔认为他过去对异教徒太宽容了，现在利用他可怕的夜间形态来追捕他们。",
	"In daylight Diamabel lounges in his palace or walks amongst the faithful. Anyone he sees that violates his holy law, or looks like they may violate his holy law, are immediately seized by his Law Givers. The lucky are scourged by the Law Givers, Diamabel's holy enforcers and either let go or slain on the spot. The unlucky are marked by Diamabel himself.": "白天，迪亚玛贝尔在他的宫殿里闲逛，或在信徒中行走。他看到的任何违反他的神圣法律的人，或看起来可能违反他的神圣法律的人，都会立即被他的执法者抓住。幸运的人被法律实施者--迪亚玛勒的神圣执法者鞭打，要么被放走，要么当场被杀。不走运的人则被迪亚玛贝尔亲自标记。",
	"As the sun sets, Diamabel is forced to transform into his monstrous form. His painful transformation complete, Diamabel takes to the skies and hunts down those who angered him. Diamabel slaughters them and their families, and burns their homes. Diamabel decapitates the dead bodies and scatters the heads in the street as a warning to their friends and neighbors.": "当太阳落山时，迪亚玛贝尔被迫转变为他的怪兽形态。痛苦的变身完成后，迪亚玛贝尔飞上天空，追杀那些惹怒他的人。迪亚马贝尔屠杀他们和他们的家人，并烧毁他们的家园。迪马贝尔将尸体斩首，并将头颅散落在街上，以警告他们的朋友和邻居。",
	"Diamabel is straightforward in his tactics. When Diamabel enters combat he glows with a fierce radiance, causing most enemies to flee from his godlike anger.": "迪亚马贝尔的战术是直截了当的。当迪亚玛贝尔进入战斗时，他就会发出凶猛的光芒，使大多数敌人从他神一样的愤怒中逃离。",
	"Diamabel cannot die as long as Pharazia exists, so with this knowledge, he charges into the midst of his foes, and sets about him with Spiritburner, his flaming sword, and smashing foes with his wings. Diamabel heals at an incredible rate, and if he is slain his body immolates, and the ashes are spread by the desert winds to the far ends of Pharazia. After a month Diamabel revives and starts to plot his revenge.": "只要法拉西亚存在，迪亚玛贝尔就不会死，所以他带着这些知识冲进敌人中间，用他的火焰之剑Spiritburner来对付他们，用他的翅膀来粉碎敌人。迪亚玛贝尔以惊人的速度痊愈，如果他被杀，他的身体就会被烧毁，灰烬被沙漠中的风吹到法拉西亚的远方。一个月后，迪亚玛贝尔苏醒过来，开始策划他的复仇。",
	"When Diamabel closes the borders of Pharazia, the land is surrounded by a blistering sandstorm. Any creature foolish enough to enter the storm is flayed to the bone almost instantly. The storm cannot be subdued by magical or mundane means and any attempt to teleport past it delivers the caster and any willing allies into the middle of its biting winds.": "当迪亚玛贝尔关闭法拉西亚的边界时，这片土地就会被刺眼的沙暴包围。任何愚蠢到进入风暴的生物几乎都会立刻被剥得皮开肉绽。这场风暴无法被魔法或世俗的手段所制服，任何试图传送过去的尝试都会将施法者和任何愿意加入的盟友送入凛冽的风中。",

The transformation takes 10 rounds and if the Lady is slain during this transformation she is permanently killed. During that week, the border will remain open and the Lady's summoned minions and the transformed humanoids will be under no authority; they may flee, attack, and protect the Lady depending on circumstances. Turning back into their original form however is impossible, except if they leave the domain, if the Lady dies or with a wish spell.": "如果在战斗中被杀，乌鸦夫人会在一团迷雾和黑色羽毛的爆炸中消失；一周后的日出，绕着塔的一只乌鸦会俯冲到塔内最高的房间地板上，变成一个有着黑发黑眼和白色皮肤的娇小女子。变身需要10个回合，如果女士在这个变身过程中被杀，她将被永久杀死。在那一周内，边界将保持开放，夫人召唤的爪牙和变身后的人形生物将不受任何约束；他们可以根据情况逃离、攻击和保护夫人。然而，变回他们的原形是不可能的，除非他们离开这个领域，如果夫人死了，或者用一个愿望咒语。",

	"No one knows the Lady of Raven's true name, including the Lady herself. She is a petite woman with long dark hair styled around elaborate combs. Her eyes are the same color as her hair and both are a perfect complement to her pale skin. Her demeanor is cold and haughty. The Lady of Ravens looks at people the same way she might look at something she just stepped in. The Lady rarely allows her icy demeanor to crack, and when she does, she can stun people with the force of her personality. Her emotional highs and lows are captivating, to behold. She can dominate a group of people through sheer force of personality alone. The Lady is more likely to relax around the isle of ravens.": "没有人知道乌鸦夫人的真实姓名，包括夫人本人。她是一个身材娇小的女人，长长的黑发围绕着精致的梳子造型。她的眼睛与头发同色，与她苍白的皮肤相得益彰。她的举止冷漠而傲慢。乌鸦夫人看人的方式就像她看她刚踩到的东西一样。夫人很少允许她的冰冷举止出现裂痕，而当她出现裂痕时，她可以用她的个性力量使人们惊呆。她的情绪高低起伏都很迷人，令人目不转睛。她可以单凭个性的力量来支配一群人。夫人在乌鸦岛周围更容易放松。",
	"The Lady of Ravens was born into a world of silence and isolation. She was the last in a long line of nobility that had long fallen into inbreeding and insanity. Her mother died when the Lady was a toddler and the Lady of Ravens neither remembers her nor cares. The Lady's father spent his days in a drugged haze and wandered the halls of the castle, talking to unseen spirits and friends long dead. The Lady never talked to the servants that raised her or took care of her day to day needs,not considering them important enough to matter in any way. The Lady despised the other children that lived in the castle, and they soon learned to avoid her altogether. The Lady of Raven's only joy was the Tower of Flint. A 400 foot tall edifice of gray stone that sat in the middle of her castle, hundreds of ravens roosted in the tower. The Lady of Ravens had inherited the ability to talk to ravens, passed down by her mother. The Lady spent hours in the tower, telling the ravens stories, and listening to the tales they told her in return. After her father's death the Lady rarely left the tower, spending days in conversation with her ravens. This was the way of things until the Lady reached her late teens. Looking out the windows of her tower, she spotted a handsome young man. The Lady became obsessed with the man, the son of a servant, and set her ravens to follow his every move. When he departed to fight in some nameless war, she was devastated, barely sleeping or eating for a year. She was overjoyed to hear the news from one of her ravens—the man had returned. Her joy turned to rage when the young man immediately fell into the arms of another woman.. Devastated and enraged, the Lady sent her ravens to tear the young lovers apart. Grief stricken, the Lady spent several days in her tower mourning the death of her obsession. When she left she found the Tower of Flint was standing alone on a isle in the middle of a vast sea. To make matters worse, the Lady found she could not remember her own name. Even more devastating, although she could command the ravens of her isle with an act of will, she could no longer talk to her friends.": "乌鸦夫人出生在一个沉默和孤立的世界。她是一长串贵族中的最后一个，这些贵族早已陷入近亲繁殖和精神错乱。她的母亲在她蹒跚学步时就去世了，乌鸦夫人既不记得她，也不在乎。夫人的父亲整日沉浸在药物的迷雾中，在城堡的大厅里徘徊，与看不见的灵魂和早已死去的朋友交谈。夫人从不与抚养她的仆人交谈，也不照顾她的日常需要，不认为他们有任何重要的意义。夫人鄙视住在城堡里的其他孩子，他们很快就学会了完全避开她。乌鸦夫人唯一的乐趣是弗林特塔。一座400英尺高的灰色石头建筑，坐落在她的城堡中央，数百只乌鸦在塔中栖息。乌鸦夫人继承了她母亲传下来的与乌鸦对话的能力。夫人在塔里呆了好几个小时，给乌鸦讲故事，并听它们讲故事作为回报。在她父亲去世后，夫人很少离开塔楼，整天与她的乌鸦交谈。这就是事情的经过，直到夫人到了十几岁的时候。她从塔楼的窗户望出去，发现了一个英俊的年轻人。夫人开始迷恋这个男人，他是一个仆人的儿子，并让她的乌鸦跟踪他的一举一动。当他离开去参加一些无名的战争时，她很受打击，一年来几乎没有睡觉或吃饭。当她从她的一只乌鸦那里听到这个消息时，她欣喜若狂--男人回来了。当这个年轻人立即投入另一个女人的怀抱时，她的喜悦变成了愤怒。夫人感到震惊和愤怒，派她的乌鸦把这对年轻恋人分开。悲痛欲绝的夫人在她的塔里呆了好几天，哀悼她所迷恋的人的死亡。当她离开时，她发现弗林特塔正孤独地矗立在茫茫大海中的一个小岛上。更糟糕的是，夫人发现她不记得自己的名字了。更具破坏性的是，尽管她可以用意志力指挥岛上的乌鸦，但她再也无法与她的朋友们交谈。",
	"The Lady of Ravens is obsessed with talking to her beloved raven friends again. She believes finding her lost name is the key to this, as the ability was passed down from her ancestors, and her name represents her ancestry. If a group of humans lands on the Lady's isle and appears to be well learned or intelligent enough to aid the Lady in her quest, she may offer them treasure or hospitality if they agree to aid her. If they don't agree to help the Lady then she will force them to serve with her magic. The Lady has magical means to track and communicate with her minions.": "乌鸦夫人痴迷于再次与她心爱的乌鸦朋友交谈。她相信找到自己丢失的名字是关键，因为这种能力是她的祖先传下来的，而她的名字代表她的祖先。如果一群人类在女士的岛屿上登陆，并且看起来学识渊博或足够聪明，可以帮助女士完成她的探索，如果他们同意帮助她，她可能会向他们提供财宝或款待。如果他们不同意帮助夫人，那么她会强迫他们用她的魔法服务。夫人有神奇的手段来追踪并与她的奴仆沟通。",
	"Occasionally, the Lady of Ravens becomes enamoured with a handsome sailor or adventurer. That individual is gifted a raven as a mark of the Lady's favor. While the raven is alive, that individual will have great fortune in the seas around the Isle of Ravens. The individual will amass great wealth and avoid the worst storms, so long as that raven survives. If the raven dies, the individual loses the Lady's favor instantly, and all his good luck turns to ash—their treasure will be stolen, food will rot in their mouth, and their friends will abandon them or die. Eventually the Lady of Ravens will appear, and change her paramour into a raven to replace her lost friend that she entrusted to that sailor. No raven gifted in this way has lived longer than two months.": "偶尔，乌鸦夫人会迷恋上一个英俊的水手或冒险家。这个人被赠予一只乌鸦作为夫人青睐的标志。当乌鸦活着的时候，这个人将在乌鸦岛周围的海域拥有巨大的财富。只要那只乌鸦还活着，这个人就会积累大量的财富并避开最严重的风暴。如果乌鸦死了，这个人就会立刻失去夫人的青睐，他所有的好运都会化为灰烬--他们的财宝会被偷走，食物会烂在嘴里，他们的朋友会抛弃他们或死去。最终，乌鸦夫人会出现，把她的姘头变成一只乌鸦，取代她托付给那个水手的失落的朋友。以这种方式赠予的乌鸦没有活过两个月的。",
	"Combat revolts the Lady. If she believes her opponents have nothing to offer her, she will use her Flight anew ability to change them into ravens as a warning to others. If pressed into actual combat, the Lady will use her powerful spells to crush her enemies from afar. If hard pressed, she will command her ravens to attack her foes, but is loath to put her precious birds in danger. Borders: When the Lady of Ravens closes her borders, storms encircle her isle. Any attempt to move through the storm is hopeless. The winds and lashing waves will blind and disorient anyone attempting to cross and push them back to the Isle of Ravens.": "战斗使夫人感到反感。如果她认为她的对手对她无能为力，她会使用她的 \"重新飞行 \"能力，将他们变成乌鸦，以警告其他人。如果被逼到真正的战斗中，夫人会用她强大的法术从远处击溃她的敌人。如果被逼急了，她会命令她的乌鸦去攻击她的敌人，但她不愿意让她的宝贝鸟儿处于危险之中。边界。当乌鸦夫人关闭她的边界时，风暴会包围她的岛屿。任何试图穿过风暴的行动都是无望的。狂风和巨浪会使任何试图穿越的人失明和迷失方向，并将他们推回乌鸦岛。"
