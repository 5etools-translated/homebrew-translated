They are at a constant low intensity war with the big people around their home for reasons only their fey minds can fully understand.

	"{@bold Foul Rituals.} Bane bogies can cast powerful spells when a circle of them gathers in a place of power. The best known of these is the ritual to create an utburd, a morbid and horrifying beast formed out of a newborn baby. They can also cast other spells, but only when there are exactly seven bane bogies casting the spells.": "{@bold Foul Rituals.} Bane bogies可以施展强大的法术，当他们一圈人聚集在一个有力量的地方。其中最著名的是创造乌特伯德的仪式，一种由新生婴儿形成的病态和恐怖的野兽。他们还可以施展其他法术，但只有在正好有七个贝恩博格施法的时候。",
	"{@bold Thieves and Tormentors.} Bane bogies get their name from the persistent harassment they inflict upon the villages near their home. They steal things, break things and even kill livestock if they get the chance. Because of this, nearby villagers often send raiding parties to destroy the nests of bane bogies, which are usually located in old trees. Such forays often end badly, as the bogies know the swamps better than the backs of their hands and often create traps around their homes to ward of anyone trying to attack them. Also, whenever they are threatened, they will certainly use their biggest weapon: the {@creature utburd|TTT} (see this booklet).": "{@bold Thieves and Tormentors.} Bane bogies的名字来自于他们对自己家附近村庄的持续骚扰。它们偷东西、砸东西，如果有机会甚至会杀死牲畜。正因为如此，附近的村民经常派遣突击队去摧毁bane bogies的巢穴，这些巢穴通常位于老树上。这样的袭击往往以失败告终，因为bogies对沼泽地的了解比他们的手背还要深，他们经常在自己的家园周围制造陷阱，以抵御任何试图攻击他们的人。此外，只要它们受到威胁，就一定会使用它们最大的武器：（1%）（见本手册）。",

Bezzans construct large, sprawling nests suspended on trees and sewer ceilings. They hunt small game and forage plants to use in construction of their nests.": "Bezzans是人形黄蜂，起源于温暖的南部湿地，但已向北蔓延，特别是进入大城市的下水道。Bezzans在树上和下水道的天花板上建造大型的、蔓延的巢穴。它们捕食小型猎物并觅食植物，用于建造它们的巢穴。",
	"{@bold Nest Builders and Weapon Crafters.} Bezzans use their saliva combined with the digested and regurgitated pulp of plant matter to create their nests. This material, once dry, is extremely resilient and can be made into light- weight armor and even weapons. Although the material can be sharpened, bezzans prefer metal weapons when they are able to trade them in exchange for their own creations. Although some humans scoff the rugged and often quite ugly equipment bezzans craft, many do find the light weight of the equipment very useful. Bezzans living in sewers are often found trading with the people living above. Since others are not usually keen on buying their crafts, bezzans will often sell foraged goods that they don't need but know humans are willing to pay for. ": "{@bold Nest Builders and Weapon Crafters.} Bezzans使用他们的唾液与植物物质的消化和反刍的果肉相结合，创造他们的巢穴。这种材料一旦干燥，就具有极强的弹性，可以制成轻质的盔甲，甚至武器。虽然这种材料可以被削尖，但当他们能够用金属武器换取自己的创作时，贝赞人更喜欢金属武器。虽然有些人类嘲笑贝赞人制作的坚固且通常相当丑陋的装备，但许多人确实发现这些装备的重量很轻，非常有用。住在下水道的贝赞人经常被发现与住在上面的人交易。由于其他人通常并不热衷于购买他们的手工艺品，贝赞人经常会出售他们不需要但知道人类愿意支付的觅食物品。",
	"{@bold Hierarchical Society of Females.} A bezzan nest is similar to a wasp's nest in construction and social structure. There are one or more queens, which produce all the bezzans living in the nest. The other bezzans are either male drones that form a harem for the queens, or infertile female workers. The workers have different duties at different stages of their life. They begin their life as larval caretakers, after which they work in nest construction and maintenance, equipment crafting, food foraging, hunting and finally warrior duty. At each stage the bezzan grows larger and stronger and its armor grows thicker.": "{@bold Hierarchical Society of Females.} 蜂巢在结构和社会结构上与黄蜂的巢相似。有一个或多个蜂王，它们生产生活在巢中的所有蜂类。其他蜂类要么是雄性无人机，为蜂王组成后宫，要么是不孕不育的雌性工人。工人们在其生命的不同阶段有不同的职责。它们开始时是作为幼虫的看护者，之后它们从事巢穴的建造和维护、设备的制作、食物的觅食、狩猎，最后是战士的职责。在每个阶段，贝赞都会变得更大更强壮，其盔甲也会变得更厚。",
	"{@bold Bezzan Worker.} Most members of the nest are workers. They are not equipped to fight but will do so when the nest is threatened. Workers are usually the ones other humanoids will come across. They forage in groups and are sometimes willing to trade with outsiders. In combat situations, workers usually support warriors and try to fight together as a group, using their wings to create a low, droning sound that confuses their opponents.": "{@bold Bezzan Worker.} 巢中大多数成员是工人。他们不具备战斗能力，但当巢穴受到威胁时，他们会这样做。工人通常是其他人类会遇到的。他们成群结队地觅食，有时愿意与外来者进行交易。在战斗情况下，工人通常支持战士，并试图作为一个团体一起战斗，用他们的翅膀创造出低沉的，让对手困惑的声音。",

	"{@bold Bezzan Warrior.} The oldest, largest and strongest bezzans are warriors. They form troops that patrol the surroundings of the nest and often go hunting with foraging workers. Warriors are often hostile on sight if there are no pre-existing relations between the bezzan and the intruders or if the strangers come unaccompanied by bezzans. They are not usually interested in negotiating and prefer to leave that to the workers.": "{@bold Bezzan Warrior.} 最年长、最大和最强壮的蜂群是战士。他们组成部队，在巢穴周围巡逻，并经常与觅食的工人一起去打猎。如果蜂群和入侵者之间没有预先存在的关系，或者如果陌生人没有蜂群的陪伴，战士们往往一见到就会产生敌意。他们通常对谈判不感兴趣，喜欢把这个问题留给工人。",

	"{@bold Bezzan Wasp Herder.} Some bezzans like to go their own way. They stray from the normal duty cycle of the bezzan and build a small nest in the outskirts of the bezzan's domain. They begin studying the nature around them and especially focus on their smaller insect cousins. These bezzan are known as wasp herders. They live on the outskirts of the nest and provide valuable semi-religious services to the nest, which is why they are tolerated by the others. Bezzan wasp herders feel that their tiny relatives are more in tune with nature than the bezzans themselves, so they seek guidance from them. They perform auguries with these insects, studying their flight patterns and behavior. Over time, they start to learn how to guide them and are eventually capable of controlling them using their voices and other signals.": "{@bold Bezzan Wasp Herder.} 有些bezzan喜欢走自己的路。他们偏离了bezzan的正常工作周期，在bezzan领域的郊区建造一个小巢。他们开始研究周围的自然环境，特别是关注他们的小型昆虫表亲。这些bezzan被称为黄蜂牧民。他们住在巢穴的外围，为巢穴提供宝贵的半宗教服务，这就是为什么他们被其他人所容忍。胡蜂牧民认为他们的小亲戚比胡蜂本身更符合自然规律，所以他们向他们寻求指导。他们用这些昆虫进行占卜，研究它们的飞行模式和行为。随着时间的推移，他们开始学习如何引导它们，并最终能够使用它们的声音和其他信号控制它们。",

	"Sometimes a half-rotten corpse hidden in a bog or a swamp near magical places of power can transform into a bogmangler. These ravenous undead resemble ghouls that have fused with the roots and plants of the bog. The vines coil around their skeleton like muscles, their teeth are thick thorns and it is impossible to tell where the bogmangler ends and the flora around it begin. They can control the vines and roots around them and even use them to catch prey that is trying to escape it. A bogmangler makes the bog its hunting ground and pulls more victims into the depths of the swamp, and these victims in turn may slowly transform into more bogmanglers. ": "有时，隐藏在沼泽或靠近魔法场所的沼泽中的半腐烂的尸体可以转化为bogmangler。这些贪婪的亡灵类似于与沼泽地的根和植物融合的食尸鬼。藤蔓像肌肉一样缠绕着他们的骨架，他们的牙齿是厚厚的刺，不可能分辨出沼泽人的终点和周围植物的起点。它们可以控制周围的藤蔓和根系，甚至用它们来捕捉试图逃离它的猎物。沼泽人将沼泽作为自己的狩猎场，并将更多的受害者拉入沼泽深处，而这些受害者又可能慢慢转化为更多的沼泽人。",
	"{@bold Endless hunger.} Like many undead, bogmanglers have an insatiable hunger for mortal flesh. Eating does nothing, however, as there is no stomach to hold the flesh it gorges down its hungry maw. Bogmanglers are stuck in an eternal cycle of feeding and hunger which only ends when the monster is finally killed.": "{@bold Endless hunger.}和许多不死生物一样，沼泽人对凡人的肉体有着永不满足的饥饿感。然而，吃东西并没有什么用，因为没有胃来容纳它饥肠辘辘的肉。沼泽人被困在一个永恒的进食和饥饿的循环中，只有当怪物最终被杀死时才会结束。",
	"{@bold Patient hunters.} Bogmanglers are ambush hunters: they prefer to catch their prey alone, if possible, but may attack against several creatures if its hunger has grown strong enough. They seldom work together with other undead, but it isn't unheard of to have several bogmanglers preying on a particularly abundant hunting spot. A bogmangler usually stays underwater when preying for its victims and uses the vines growing from its body to sense the presence of its potential victims.": "{@bold Patient hunters.} 沼泽人是伏击猎手：如果可能的话，他们更喜欢单独抓捕猎物，但如果猎物的饥饿感足够强烈，他们也会对几个生物进行攻击。它们很少与其他亡灵一起工作，但在一个特别丰富的狩猎点上有几个沼泽猎手也不是没有发生过。猎杀受害者时，沼泽人通常呆在水下，并利用从其身体上长出的藤蔓来感知潜在受害者的存在。",

	"{@bold Endless Hunger.} From time to time a single gorgemaw starts to eat even more hungrily than usual. It starts to eat constantly, devouring everything it can catch, and begin to grow. Within days it's bigger than a horse, within a fortnight the size of an elephant and continues to grow even after that. At this point, the swamp will be completely void of other animal life. Creatures that can escape have done so and the gorgemaw moves beyond the swamp–and usually into humanoid settlements.

It lays thousands of eggs in one go and then dies. The newborn gorgemaws eat their mother and leave the nest to populate the surrounding countryside.
