	"No one truly knows when or how the false hydra came to be. It is an abomination, seen by few, and survived by fewer. Some say that is similar to a plant, that it grows from the ground like a sprout with no seed, that it germinates on lies and dishonesty. Others say that it is almost like a vicious fungus, a mindless life form that knows nothing beyond devouring and surviving. Some say they are the last vestiges of a curse from a fallen goddess, who sent them as punishment to the mortals who so conveniently turn their backs on inconvenient truths. In truth, scholars have no better idea. The few who believe in and attempt to study this creature have found little information about it, only aware of three things for certain: the false hydra sings, the false hydra grows, and the false hydra eats.": "没有人真正知道假九头蛇是何时或如何出现的。它是一种可憎的东西，很少有人看到，存活下来的人更少。有人说这类似于植物，它像一个没有种子的芽一样从地里长出来，它在谎言和不诚实上发芽。还有人说，它几乎就像一种恶毒的真菌，是一种无意识的生命形式，除了吞噬和生存之外什么都不知道。有人说它们是一位堕落女神的诅咒的最后残余，女神派它们来惩罚那些对不方便的事实轻易置之不理的凡人。事实上，学者们并没有更好的想法。少数相信并试图研究这种生物的人几乎找不到关于它的信息，只知道三件事是肯定的：假九头蛇会唱歌，假九头蛇会生长，假九头蛇会吃东西。",
	"The false hydra begins its life cycle as a head, with roughly the same proportions as an average humanoid's. This head, however, is pale, and hairless, with wet, eyeless sockets and a large mouth filled with broad, flat teeth. It finds itself buried deep beneath the earth near a settlement, and it grows. As it grows, it develops a fleshy, flabby torso, which serves as a \"root\". It is from this root that all further heads grow. The first head slowly pushes its way up through the dirt, breaking through the soil in the basement, beneath the stairs. Or beneath the brush around the house. Or through a broken cobblestone in the street. And then, when it has reached the surface, it sings.": "假九头蛇开始其生命周期时是一个头，其比例与普通人的比例大致相同。然而，这个头是苍白的，没有头发，有湿润的、没有眼睛的眼窝和一张大嘴，里面长满了宽大的、扁平的牙齿。它发现自己被埋在一个定居点附近的地底深处，它在成长。随着它的成长，它形成了一个肉质的、松弛的躯干，作为一个 \"根\"。所有其他的头都是从这个根上长出来的。第一个头慢慢地从泥土中挤上来，突破地下室的土壤，在楼梯下面。或者在房子周围的灌木下面。或者穿过街道上破碎的鹅卵石。然后，当它到达表面时，它就会唱歌。",
	"While the false hydra sings, it is ignored. It is not invisible: it simply sits in our blind spot, its song creating gaps in our memory while it watches its prey go about its day, waiting until a safe moment to strike. The false hydra must bide its time to find the right moment, as when it eats, it cannot sing. When it isn't singing, it can be seen.": "当假九头蛇唱歌的时候，它被忽略了。它不是隐形的：它只是坐在我们的盲点上，它的歌声在我们的记忆中造成了空白，而它却看着它的猎物过着自己的日子，等待着一个安全的时刻来攻击。假水螅必须等待时机，因为当它吃东西时，它不能唱歌。当它不唱歌的时候，它可以被看到。",
	"The false hydra eats flesh, of course, and its favorite prey is humanoids. In the beginning of its life, while it only has one head, though, eating presents a challenge. To eat, it must stop singing. Thus, the first stage of a false hydra infestation is often the longest, as it waits for a lone victim to drag away into a basement, sewer, or small cave it has excavated for this purpose.": "假九头蛇当然是吃肉的，它最喜欢的猎物是人类。在它生命的开始阶段，虽然它只有一个头，但吃东西是个挑战。为了吃东西，它必须停止唱歌。因此，假九头蛇出没的第一阶段往往是最漫长的，因为它在等待一个孤独的受害者，将其拖入地下室、下水道或它为此而开凿的小洞穴。",
	"In any normal circumstances, the victims of the false hydra would have family, or friends who would notice their absence, but the false hydra's song massages their mind, smoothing the wrinkles in their thoughts. The false hydra's victims become a part of the creature, and thus the creature's song erases all memories of him. Their absence will not be noticed. They are forgotten. And as more and more join the false hydra, the more it grows, the more it's neck stretches, and the more its influence grows.": "在任何正常情况下，假九头蛇的受害者都会有家人或朋友注意到他们的缺席，但假九头蛇的歌声按摩着他们的心灵，抚平他们思想中的皱纹。假九头蛇的受害者成为该生物的一部分，因此该生物的歌声消除了所有关于他的记忆。他们的缺席将不会被注意到。他们被遗忘了。随着越来越多的人加入假九头蛇，它越发壮大，它的脖子越发伸长，它的影响力也越发增强。",
	"The false hydra's song soothes the minds of their victims, coaxing out the memories of their prey in the same way it hides the false hydra, but it is not a perfect defense. Parents will ask why they have boy's clothes but only one daughter. A shopkeep will forget why there are two names above the store's door.": "假九头蛇的歌声抚慰着受害者的心灵，以隐藏假九头蛇的方式哄骗出猎物的记忆，但这并不是一种完美的防御。父母会问为什么他们有男孩的衣服却只有一个女儿。店主会忘记为什么店门上方有两个名字。",
	"Farmhands will wonder why someone hasn't harvested their section of field. Churches will find themselves without a pastor.": "农场主会想，为什么有人没有收割他们那块田。教会将发现自己没有牧师。",
	"More often than not, these gaps will close on their own. The parents will remember they took care of their neighbor's child when they went out of town. The shopkeep will remember the last winter took their partner. The farmhands will remember they recently expanded the field, and forgot to assign someone to harvest it. The churchgoers will remember their pastor's faith was needed in the big city to the north.": "更多的时候，这些差距会自己缩小。父母会记得他们出城时照顾了邻居的孩子。店主会记得去年冬天带着他们的伙伴。农场主会记得他们最近扩大了田地，却忘了派人去收割它。教徒们会记得他们的牧师的信仰在北方的大城市中被需要。",
	"But still, some small, confused part of their mind will recognize the wrongness of it. That part of their mind is locked away, ignored, deemed the dark part of their mind that lurks in everyone, a part that good folk know is nothing more than wrongful temptation.": "但是，他们头脑中的一些小的、混乱的部分仍然会认识到它的错误性。他们心灵的那一部分被锁起来，被忽视，被认为是潜伏在每个人心中的黑暗部分，这部分好心人知道，这不过是错误的诱惑。",
	"This strains the mind. At first, it feels like paranoia, like they are being watched (and they are being watched) but they will never be able to see who by, until it's too late. As time passes, more symptoms develop. Reminiscing becomes stressful and unpleasant, and thus is avoided. Memories become distorted and confusing, and faces blur together and identities become distorted.": "这使人感到紧张。起初，这感觉就像偏执狂，就像他们被监视（他们也被监视），但他们永远无法看到是谁通过，直到太晚。随着时间的推移，更多的症状发展。回忆变得紧张和不愉快，因此被避免了。记忆变得扭曲和混乱，面孔模糊不清，身份变得扭曲。",
	"Mortal brains were not meant to take this weight. Mental disorders develop like a mold. Nervous ticks, psychotic breaks, and hallucinations abound.": "凡人的大脑本不应该承受这种重量。精神障碍就像一个模子一样发展。神经衰弱、精神错乱和幻觉比比皆是。",
	"The older the false hydra gets, the more heads it grows. The more heads it has, the more careless it becomes, as it can afford to have one head stop singing to eat. As the number of heads grows, so to do the number of missing townsfolk, the number of inconsistent memories floating around the survivors.": "假水螅的年龄越大，它的头就越多。它的头越多，它就越不小心，因为它可以承受一个头停止唱歌来吃东西。随着头颅数量的增加，失踪的镇民数量也在增加，漂浮在幸存者周围的不一致的记忆数量也在增加。",
	"The more mature the false hydra, the more necks stretch up above the rooftops. Thick, pale tree trunks topped with bulging, bony heads with unhinging jaws filled with daggerlike teeth.": "假九头蛇越是成熟，脖子就越是伸到屋顶之上。粗大、苍白的树干上顶着隆起的、瘦骨嶙峋的头，下巴上长满了匕首般的牙齿。",
	"When the false hydra is fully grown - usually once it is approaching ten heads - the next stage of its life cycle begins. The false hydra ensures there is at least one survivor for each head it has grown. Then, it begins to sing a new song. This new song dominates the weak-minded and psychotic, while still subjecting others to the mind-numbing forgetfulness of the first song.": "当假水螅完全长大时--通常是接近10个头时--其生命周期的下一个阶段开始。假水螅确保它长出的每个头至少有一个幸存者。然后，它开始唱一首新歌。这首新歌主宰着心智脆弱和精神错乱的人，同时仍然让其他人受到第一首歌曲中令人头疼的遗忘。",
	"Each survivor is given a head, which continues to sing, and they all go their separate ways. Each victim is sent to a nearby town. Along the way, the singing continues. Any who pass them on the road are only temporarily taken under the false hydra's song, just long enough to forget they saw the lone traveler. When the carriers arrive in a new town, they find a spot to bury themselves and their head. When they do, the larva uses the carrier as it's first victim until it has grown enough to resurface. Then, the cycle begins anew, in a new town.": "每个幸存者都有一个头，继续唱歌，他们都各奔东西。每个受害者都被送到附近的一个城镇。一路上，歌声不断。任何在路上经过他们的人都只是暂时被假九头蛇的歌声所吸引，时间长到足以让他们忘记看到这个孤独的旅行者。当携带者到达一个新的城镇时，他们找到一个地方埋葬自己和自己的头。当他们这样做的时候，幼虫就把携带者作为它的第一个受害者，直到它长大到足以重新出现。然后，这个循环在一个新的城镇重新开始。",
	"The first stage of the false hydra life cycle is simply a head. This pale, vaguely human head has little to no mobility on it's own, instead relying on the broken mind of its host to carry it to a new town to begin its growth. It is capable of maintaining a hum, which serves to continue the domination of it's host, as well as disguising itself from any who might encounter it on the road. Instead of seeing a shaken, broken person carrying a nightmarish, decapitated head, they would perhaps see a haggard old beggar, moving from one town to the next, carrying their only possesions in their arms. The larva's song is weak, and easily broken, and intense scrutiny of the traveler will often reveal the true nature of what is happening.": "假九头蛇生命周期的第一个阶段只是一个头。这个苍白的、模糊的人类头颅几乎没有自己的行动力，而是依靠其宿主破碎的心灵将它带到一个新的城镇开始成长。它能够保持嗡嗡声，这有助于继续支配它的主人，同时也能向任何可能在路上遇到的人伪装自己。他们看到的不是一个摇摇欲坠、残缺不全的人抱着一个噩梦般的、被砍掉的头颅，而是一个憔悴的老乞丐，从一个城镇到另一个城镇，怀里抱着他们唯一的财产。幼虫的歌声很弱，很容易被打断，对旅行者的强烈审视往往会揭示出事情的真实面目。",
	"The second stage of the false hydra is the pupal stage. This stage begins after the creature has been carried to a new town, buried, and feasted on the host that brought it. This stage has only one head, and is the longest stage in the cycle as they must wait for the best moment to be able to capture their prey so that the lack of their song does not give them away to the townsfolk. When the false hydra has devoured enough townsfolk to grow more heads, it enters the next stage.": "假九头蛇的第二个阶段是蛹的阶段。这个阶段是在生物被带到一个新的城镇后开始的，被埋葬，并以带来它的主人为食。这个阶段只有一个头，是周期中最长的阶段，因为它们必须等待最佳时机，以便能够捕获它们的猎物，这样它们的歌声就不会被城镇居民发现。当假九头蛇吞噬了足够多的镇民，长出更多的头时，它就进入了下一个阶段。",
	"The third stage of the false hydra has developed multiple heads, usually two to four, and is beginning to be less cautious when it eats, as it can often have one head continue its song while the other devours the victim. It is still young, however, and tends to keep stores of flesh in its subterranean body so that it might regrow heads in case of emergency.": "第三阶段的假水螅已经长出了多个头，通常是2到4个，并且在吃东西时开始不那么谨慎，因为它经常可以在一个头继续唱歌，而另一个头则吞噬受害者。然而，它仍然年轻，并倾向于在其地下身体中保留肉的储存，以便在紧急情况下重新长出头。",
	"The fourth stage of the false hydra is when it becomes a true menace to adventurers, having grown enough heads (anywhere from five to eight) and stored enough beneath the ground to be able to grow back its heads a number of times. The false hydra's head have grown into thick, almost tree-trunk like appendages that can survey the settlement from above the rooftops. At this stage, it is merely waiting to further thin down the numbers in the town before advancing to its final stage.": "假九头蛇的第四个阶段是它成为冒险者的真正威胁的时候，它已经长出了足够多的头（从5个到8个不等），并在地面下储存了足够多的头，能够多次长出头来。假九头蛇的头已经长成了粗大的，几乎像树干一样的附属物，可以从屋顶上方观察定居点。在这个阶段，它只是在等待进一步减少镇上的人数，然后再推进到最后阶段。",
	"The fifth and final stage of the false hydra has grown nine or more heads, and begun singing the Song of Domination. At this point, the few surviving townsfolk are under it's control and making preparations to scatter the heads to other towns. The elder false hydra is nearly omnipotent in its town, as the collected memories of its victims have given it knowledge of most threats it could face, especially if it has eaten adventurers or other worldly people.": "第五阶段也是最后阶段的假九头蛇已经长出了九个或更多的头，并开始唱起了统治之歌。此时，少数幸存的镇民在它的控制下，正准备将头颅散落到其他城镇。年长的假九头蛇在镇上几乎是无所不能的，因为收集到的受害者的记忆已经让它知道了它可能面临的大多数威胁，特别是如果它吃过冒险者或其他世俗的人。",
	"Due to the nature of the false hydra as a creature, it's rather hard to give the song a DC as a baseline to ignore it's effects.
