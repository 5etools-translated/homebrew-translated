	"Sword Dancers are elite priests of Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden, blessed with the ability to channel Eilistraee's power in an unique way - through the so-called Spellsong. They are mostly female drow, elves and half-elves, although males are allowed to become Darksong Knights too. While there is no official hierarchy amongst the followers of Eilistraee, Sword Dancers often are considered to be the most powerful ones, especially when it comes to combat.": "剑舞者是黑暗少女艾利斯特莱的精英祭司，被赋予了以独特方式引导艾利斯特莱的力量的能力--通过所谓的咒语。他们大多是女性鸦人、精灵和半精灵，尽管男性也被允许成为达克松骑士。虽然艾利斯特雷的追随者中没有正式的等级制度，但剑舞者通常被认为是最强大的，尤其是在战斗时。",
	"Becoming a Sword Dancer is a difficult endeavour, as it requires both rigid following of rules such as having been on the surface for long enough, regularly performing rituals, singing and dancing each night in the moon's light to receive Eilistraee's blessings, and a great amount of training, far more than what is required for other orders of followers of Eilistraee.  A Sword Dancer is not just a master of combat, they are masters of the arts of song and dance too, they are fit acrobats and skilled diplomats.": "成为一名剑舞者是一项艰巨的工作，因为它既需要严格遵守规则，如在地面上待了足够长的时间，定期举行仪式，每晚在月光下唱歌跳舞以获得Eilistraee的祝福，也需要大量的训练，远远超过Eilistraee的其他追随者命令的要求。 剑舞者不仅是战斗的大师，他们也是歌舞艺术的大师，他们是合适的杂技演员和熟练的外交家。",
	"Unlike the fairly narrowly specialiced orders of Silverhair Knights and Darksong Knights, Sword Dancers perform a broad spectrum of activities. They fight as warriors for Eilistraee on missions both on the surface and in the underdark, they use their diplomatic skills to promote harmony between drow and other races and to generally improve the acceptance of surface drow, and they aid the local population by supplying them with food, water and by curing curses and diseases to establish friendships and a place where drow can live on the surface world.": "与银发骑士和达克松骑士这些专业性相当强的骑士团不同，剑舞者的活动范围很广。他们作为埃利斯特雷的战士在地表和地下世界执行任务，他们利用自己的外交技巧促进乌鸦和其他种族之间的和谐，并普遍提高地表乌鸦的接受度，他们通过向当地居民提供食物、水和治愈诅咒和疾病来帮助他们建立友谊和一个乌鸦可以在地表世界生活的地方。",
	"{@b Eilistraee's Front.} Sword Dancers usually lead and fight at the frontline of missions to to free other drow from Lolth's web, to bring them out of the underdark, to the surface world. Sword Dancers usually fight in groups to make full use of their Spellsong, lone Sword Dancers usually avoid fighting until they can gather some allies - although even a lone Sword Dancer is a force to be reckoned with. On missions in the underdark, Sword Dancers usually are accompanied by Silverhair Knights and Darksong Knights, who are specialiced on redeeming drow and hunting down Lolth's demonic servants respectively.": "{@b Eilistraee's Front.} 剑舞者通常领导并战斗在任务的最前线，将其他乌鸦从洛尔思的网中解救出来，将他们从地下世界带到地面世界。剑舞者通常以小组形式作战，以充分利用他们的法术之歌，孤独的剑舞者通常会避免战斗，直到他们能够聚集一些盟友--尽管即使是孤独的剑舞者也是一股不可忽视的力量。在暗黑世界的任务中，剑舞者通常由银发骑士和达克松骑士陪同，他们分别专门负责救赎鸦人和追捕洛尔思的恶魔仆人。",
	"{@b Wielders of the Singing Swords.} Each Sword Dancer wields a sword, which by itself gives off a faint singing while drawn, echoing the Sword Dancer's own song. These swords, known as singing swords, are blessed by Eilistraee and bear powerful magic within them. However, only a skilled Sword Dancer capable of properly combining swordplay, song and dance on the battlefield, which by itself requires countless of hours of training, can awaken the sword's magic: the Sword Dancer's mind becomes shielded from any spells and other effects that would negatively affect it and the accuracy of the Sword Dancer's strikes reaches levels beyond imagination, even the toughest armor is sliced through like butter and even the most elusive enemy is caught by the sword's blade.": "{@b Wielders of the Singing Swords.} 每个剑舞者都挥舞着一把剑，这把剑在拔出时本身就会发出微弱的歌声，与剑舞者自己的歌声相呼应。这些被称为 \"歌唱之剑 \"的剑受到Eilistraee的祝福，其中蕴含着强大的魔法。然而，只有熟练的剑舞者能够在战场上正确地结合剑术、歌曲和舞蹈，这本身就需要无数个小时的训练，才能唤醒剑的魔力：剑舞者的思想会被屏蔽掉任何法术和其他会对其产生负面影响的影响，剑舞者打击的准确性达到超出想象的水平，即使是最坚硬的盔甲也会像黄油一样被切开，即使是最难以捉摸的敌人也被剑刃抓住。",
	"{@b Moonlight Missiles.} The {@spell magic missile|PHB} spell, bestowed upon them by Eilistraee in a version that creates missiles of pure, silvery moonlight, has a special value for Sword Dancers, as they have learned to incorporate it into their performances in various ways, making it a highly efficient tool in combat. When cast on their own sword, it causes white and blue flames to erupt from the blade empowering the strike, when cast in the sky, the missiles combine into a ray of moonlight, and when the missiles wave and twirl around a dancing Sword Dancer like little lights of moonfire, they protect the Sword Dancer from attacks.": "{@b Moonlight Missiles.}由Eilistraee赋予他们的{@spell magic missile|PHB}法术，其版本能创造出纯银色月光的导弹，对剑舞者有特殊的价值，因为他们已经学会以各种方式将其融入表演，使其成为战斗中的高效工具。当施放在他们自己的剑上时，会使白色和蓝色的火焰从剑刃上喷发出来，赋予攻击力，当施放在天空中时，导弹结合成一束月光，当导弹像月火的小灯一样在跳舞的剑舞者周围挥舞和旋转时，它们保护剑舞者免受攻击。",
	"{@b Spellsong.} Sword Dancers are capable of using a special kind of magic known as the Spellsong.  By singing, they can focus on their magic even in the midst of combat, being able to cast spells of up to 4th level and incorporate them seamlessly into their dance-like fighting style.": "{@b Spellsong.} 剑舞者能够使用一种特殊的魔法，称为咒语歌。 通过唱歌，他们甚至可以在战斗中专注于自己的魔法，能够施展高达4级的法术，并将它们完美地融入到他们舞蹈般的战斗风格中。",
	"However, what truly makes the Spellsong unique is the fact that multiple Sword Dancers can sing together as a choir to cast spells of much greater power. Combining their voices does not only result in a beautiful piece of music, it also results in great feats of healing and resurrection - or in devastation on the battlefield.": "然而，真正使咒语歌独特的是，多个剑舞者可以作为一个合唱团一起唱歌，以施展更强大的法术。他们的声音结合在一起不仅能产生优美的音乐，还能产生伟大的治疗和复活的效果--或者在战场上造成破坏。",
	"If at least three Sword Dancers are within 60 feet of each other, they all have access to the following additional spells and spell slots. These spells do not require material components, but they always require verbal components when cast by Sword Dancers, even if they usually don't. The Sword Dancers share these spell slots amongst themselves and can also use them to upcast their own spells:": "如果至少有三个舞剑者在60英尺范围内，他们都可以使用以下额外的法术和法术槽。这些法术不需要物质成分，但当剑舞者施放时，它们总是需要语言成分，即使它们通常不需要。剑舞者之间共享这些法术槽，也可以用它们来提升自己的法术。",

	"The spell save DC for spells cast by a choir of spellsinging Sword Dancers increases by 1 for every three Sword Dancers that are part of the choir.": "由会施法的剑舞者组成的合唱团所施展的法术救赎DC，每三个剑舞者组成的合唱团增加1。"
