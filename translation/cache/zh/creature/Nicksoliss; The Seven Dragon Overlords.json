	"Coming from the Icy Pillars at the south of the continent, the Crystal Nightmare Coldryum is the quietest and most tranquil of all the DragonOverlords. Be it his serious and observant demeanor or his natural connection to the ancient element of ice, Coldryum never acts before assessing the situation at hand, knowing best when to take advantage of a situation.": "来自大陆南部的冰柱，水晶梦魇Coldryum是所有龙之霸主中最安静、最沉稳的。无论是他严肃和善于观察的举止，还是他与古老的冰元素的天然联系，科德莱姆在评估手头的情况之前从不采取行动，他知道什么时候能最好地利用一种情况。",
	"However, beneath his calmly presence hides great ambition. The most greedy Overlord, Coldryum exploited the chaos provoked by the attack to steal all he could find in the ruins of the crumbling city. With mountains of gold and piles of magical items in his claws, the Crystal Nightmare knew that the Hunting Games would be the perfect opportunity to increase his riches. It was him who convinced the otherDragon Overlords that the Hunting Games should be repeated every 100 years, giving the Imperians enough time to recover, to once again gather treasure for his grasp.": "然而，在他平静的外表下隐藏着巨大的野心。作为最贪婪的霸主，科德莱姆利用攻击所引发的混乱，在破败的城市废墟中偷窃他能找到的一切。爪子里有堆积如山的黄金和成堆的魔法物品，水晶梦魇知道狩猎游戏将是增加他财富的最佳机会。正是他说服了其他龙族霸主，狩猎游戏应该每100年重复一次，给小恶魔们足够的时间来恢复，以便再次收集宝藏供他掌握。",
	"When it comes to dealing with the rest of the Overlords,however, Coldryum usually opts for a low profile approach.While sharing his amusement with the champions with theUndying Shadow, Umbrazar, with whom he has an uneasy alliance, the Crystal Nightmare avoids treating with the rest of the Overlords, especially when it comes to the Terror of the Depths Slithrae and Athrazor, Lord of Cinder, whom he considers nothing more than savages.": "虽然与不死之影的冠军分享他的乐趣，但水晶梦魇避免与其他霸主打交道，特别是当涉及到深渊的恐怖者斯里斯拉和灰烬之主阿瑟拉索时，他认为这些人不过是野蛮人。",
	"Thus, while most of the Overlords enjoy themselves wreaking havoc throughout the city and battling against the champions of other planes, Coldryum employs his time assaulting any structure that may contain loot worth taking.However, when battle comes to him, none can withstand his power over ice and cold. Knowing that any adventurers brought to Imperia would surely bring with them relics of other lands, the Crystal Nightmare eagerly awaits any opportunity to face the mortal champions in combat and claim their possessions for himself.": "因此，当大多数霸主享受他们自己在整个城市的破坏和与其他星球的冠军战斗时，冷酷无情地利用他的时间攻击任何可能包含值得采取的战利品的结构。然而，当战斗来到他面前时，没有人能够抵挡他对冰和冷的力量。水晶梦魇知道任何被带到因佩里亚的冒险者肯定会带来其他地方的遗物，他急切地等待着任何机会，在战斗中面对凡人的冠军，并为自己索取他们的财产。",

	"No matter his origins, one thing is for certain: all the Overlords acknowledge Magnamanus as the strongest and pseudo-leader of the group. He was the first to attack Imperia after the mortals' invasion of his lands, as punishment for their hubris. In his eyes, only he was worthy of expanding his domain across the land; the fact that he'd allowed the rest of his brethren to take territories of their own was merely due to them belonging to his kin. As the Dragon Tyrant, those he considered worthy deserved such recognition, and the Overlords represented the pinnacle of dragonkin, inferior only to himself.": "无论他的出身如何，有一点是肯定的：所有的霸主都承认麦格纳努斯是最强的，也是伪领袖。在凡人入侵他的土地后，他是第一个攻击英佩里亚的人，作为对他们傲慢的惩罚。在他眼里，只有他才配在这片土地上扩张他的领地；他允许他的其他兄弟们占领自己的领土，只是因为他们属于他的亲属。作为龙暴君，他认为有价值的人应该得到这样的认可，而霸主们代表了龙族的巅峰，只比他自己差。",
	"Thus, when such measly creatures dared tread into his lands, Magnamanus took it upon himself to show those insolent mortals their place in this world. The few survivors of the first Hunting Games tell of a thunderous roar heard across all the continent, heralding the doom of their civilization. Not long after, the Overlords appeared in the city of Imperia, as if rallying under the will of the Dragon Tyrant.Even with all their knowledge, grand armies, powerful weapons and mighty Champions, the kingdom fell under the might of the Overlords.": "因此，当这些卑微的生物敢于踏入他的土地时，马格纳姆努斯主动向这些无礼的凡人展示他们在这个世界上的地位。第一届狩猎游戏的少数幸存者讲述了整个大陆听到的雷鸣般的吼声，预示着他们文明的末日。不久之后，霸主们出现在因佩利亚城，仿佛在龙族暴君的意志下集结。即使有他们所有的知识、庞大的军队、强大的武器和强大的冠军，这个王国还是倒在了霸主们的威力之下。",
	"However, Magnamanus knew that the mortals' nature would eventually lead them back to him, thirsty for revenge.The Crystal Nightmare's proposal of creating the HuntingGames served the purpose of not only entertaining his fellowOverlords, but most importantly, remember the citizens ofImperia their place: beneath them, beneath him.": "然而，马格纳努斯知道，凡人的本性最终会使他们回到他身边，渴求复仇。水晶梦魇提出的创建狩猎游戏的目的不仅是为了娱乐他的同僚，最重要的是，让英普尔的公民记住他们的位置：在他们之下，在他之下。",
