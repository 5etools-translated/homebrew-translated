	"Once fierce human warriors, these barbarians were cursed with vampirism by the mists of Ravenloft for turning to cannibalism as a ritual demonstration of might. Now they roam the dark wilderness in search of prey to satisfy their thirst for blood.": "这些野蛮人曾经是凶猛的人类战士，因为转而以食人作为仪式上的力量展示，而被拉文洛夫特的迷雾诅咒了吸血鬼症。现在他们在黑暗的荒野中游荡，寻找猎物来满足他们对血的渴望。",

	"These vampires have a ferocious appetite for blood during combat. Each time a living creature is hit by one of the bloodrager's claw attacks the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or start bleeding from the wound. The character suffers no ill effect, but the bloodrager who caused damage enters a blood frenzy, gaining advantage on attacks against the bleeding target until either the target or the bloodrager is slain. Due to its recklessness however attacks against a frenzied bloodrager have advantage. A bloodrager can only gain advantage against a single target, who it will try to slay at any cost, even ignoring other foes altogether.": "这些吸血鬼在战斗中对血有一种凶猛的胃口。每当一个生物被吸血者的爪子攻击击中时，目标必须在一个{@dc 14}的宪法救赎中成功，否则就会从伤口开始流血。该角色不会受到任何影响，但是造成伤害的吸血者会进入血腥的狂热状态，在对流血目标的攻击中获得优势，直到目标或吸血者被杀死。然而由于它的鲁莽，对狂热的吸血者的攻击具有优势。嗜血者只能对一个目标获得优势，它将不惜一切代价杀死这个目标，甚至完全无视其他敌人。",
	"As a bonus action a bloodrager can shapeshift into a huge and blood-soaked wolf to attack its foes. Use the game statistics of a giant hyena with the added vampire resistances and weaknesses and the extra 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage on a bite and the accompanying hit point reducing and regenerating effects. Once transformed the bloodrager assumes the creature's total hit points and reverts to its humanoid form if its hit points drop to 0, any excess damage carrying over to the bloodrager's regular hit points. The transformation can also be dismissed as a bonus action. Bloodragers often turn into wolf form when they enter a blood frenzy.": "作为一个额外的动作，吸血者可以变身为一只巨大的、充满血腥味的狼来攻击它的敌人。使用巨型土狼的游戏统计数据，并增加吸血鬼的抵抗力和弱点，以及咬人时额外的9({@damage 2d8})坏死伤害和伴随的降低命中率和再生的效果。一旦变身，吸血者就会拥有该生物的总命中率，如果它的命中率下降到0，就会恢复到它的人形形态，任何多余的伤害都会转移到吸血者的常规命中率上。这种转变也可以作为一个额外的动作被解除。嗜血者在进入血液狂热状态时通常会变成狼的形态。",
