	"In a long-lost language, the word oruk—\"blood fire\"—described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one other as kanin in their own tongue, they also use \"orc\" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk. Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.": "在一种早已失传的语言中，oruk这个词--\"血火\"--描述了兽人在将自己推向极限时的炽热外观。虽然兽人在自己的语言中知道对方是卡宁，但他们也非常自豪地使用 \"兽人\"，特别是在与其他民族打交道时。兽人的历史跨越了世界和所有的时代。他们定居在村庄和城市，炎热和寒冷的气候，高山和地下深处。大多数兽人生活在多样化的人形社会中，尽管有少数人隐居在热带地区。",

	"Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which can range from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.": "兽人长到令人印象深刻的高度。当他们兴奋或被驱赶时，通常在他们坚韧的皮肤上纹上的血管会显得更加鲜艳。他们的头发，从粗到细，从头上延伸，像皇室的衣冠一样垂在肩上。强壮的獠牙从他们的嘴唇上延伸过去，保护着他们的其他牙齿。",
	"Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with \"blood fire,\" glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white respectively.": "很少有其他人类能与兽人的耐力相提并论，为狩猎和战斗而训练的兽人可以使自己的行动更快，胜利更久。如果兽人发现自己处于死亡的边缘，他们的血管会本能地涌出 \"血火\"，发出耀眼的光芒，使他们振作起来进行最后一次攻击。血火通常呈红色，尽管来自山区和地下的兽人分别发出蓝色和白色的光芒。",
	"The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc conduits hone their magic into singular affinities that are easy to manipulate. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.": "兽人精神的强烈力量偶尔会表现为原始的魔法。兽人导管将他们的魔法磨练成易于操纵的单一亲和力。兽人族的地球人通过他们的双脚移动他们的魔法，涌入大地。兽人唤神者用歌声来激发每个生物精神中固有的魔法。",

	"Orcs rely on giant flightless birds called scyzas to carry them over great distances. Orcs adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses of interconnected gondolas that freely swing along their thick plumage. The birds are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts.": "兽人依靠被称为 \"镰刀 \"的巨大的不会飞的鸟类来携带他们走很远的路。半兽人为这些起源于热带地区的坐骑配备了由相互连接的吊船组成的巨大马具，可以沿着它们厚厚的羽翼自由摆动。这些鸟在面对危险时无所畏惧，使它们成为完美的战斗坐骑。",

	"Dohma Raskovar is the latest in a long line of leaders—known as dohmas—of the Ivory Throne, a band of mercenaries. Under Raskovar's leadership, the throne has grown to over a hundred strong, and now they handle multiple contracts simultaneously, occasionally banding together to fight as a single unit in battle.": "Dohma Raskovar是象牙王座（Ivory Throne）一长串领导人中最新的一位，他们被称为dohmas，是一队雇佣兵。在拉斯科瓦尔的领导下，王座已经发展到一百多人，现在他们同时处理多个合同，偶尔会联合起来作为一个单位作战。",
	"Raskovar runs the throne from the Hanging Tree, his tavern where he plays the role of barkeep. Here, clients in the know can discreetly indicate their desire to hire bounty hunters, cutthroats, or thieves by ordering a boiling oil, a mundane blend of whiskey and rum that appears on no menu.": "拉斯科瓦在他的酒馆 \"悬铃木 \"里掌管着王位，他在那里扮演着酒吧老板的角色。在这里，知情的客户可以通过点一份沸腾的油，一种没有出现在菜单上的威士忌和朗姆酒的普通混合物，谨慎地表明他们想要雇佣赏金猎人、割喉者或小偷。",
	"Once the drink is ordered, Raskovar himself appears at the table, ready to do business. He prides himself on remaining politically neutral and treating all potential customers as equals, something that chafes a few of his clients. Many local nobles have stormed out of the Hanging Tree in a rage after Raskovar refused to use the proper forms of address—only to return later when their situation is more desperate, and pride too costly.": "一旦点了酒，拉斯科瓦本人就出现在桌前，准备做生意。他以保持政治中立和平等对待所有潜在客户为荣，这一点让他的一些客户感到不快。许多当地的贵族在拉斯科瓦尔拒绝使用适当的称呼方式后，怒气冲冲地冲出了悬铃木--后来当他们的处境更加绝望，而骄傲的代价又太高时，他们又回来了。",
