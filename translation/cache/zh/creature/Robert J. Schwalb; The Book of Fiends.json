In just a few days, it can deplete the food reserves of the average village. Some bulugons don't stop even after the food stock is gone. These malefic gluttons turn on the locals and start to feed on them. There are many tales of the heinous lotteries enacted by small communities as the locals tried to choose the next victim of the bulugon's insatiable appetite.

Upon successfully completing an assignment, the killer returns to its employer wearing the proof of its success—the face of its target.": "在地狱的种姓系统中升级是一项艰巨的任务。它可能需要数千年的忠诚服务，一种牺牲行为，或者抓住一个独特的机会--可能永远不会到来。虽然有许多魔鬼愿意遵守社会规则，但也有一些魔鬼更喜欢沉默的刀子的准则。正是这些渴望权力的魔鬼在召唤无面者。无面者是一个由杀手组成的社会，他们向任何愿意付出代价的人提供服务。这个代价就是灵魂。在成功完成任务后，杀手会带着成功的证明--目标人物的脸，回到雇主身边。",

If an assassination is unsuccessful, the fee is returned. In addition, the former target has the right to hire one of the faceless to kill the original employer—free of charge.": "一些严格的准则约束着无面者的每个成员。除非有明确的目标，否则他们决不能杀人。除了上级给他们的任务外，他们永远不能接受其他任务。一个目标被分配给一个无面者，他们必须成功完成任务，否则就得死。如果暗杀不成功，费用会被退回。此外，前目标人物有权雇佣一名无面者免费杀死原雇主。",

When mortals bargain with Hell to eliminate a hated rival or dispense with a troublesome spouse, the felugons are the ones who make the deal and carry out the killing with practiced ease. If double-crossed, however, felugons descend on their erstwhile employers and exact their price in blood and souls. They take the \"unseen\" moniker from the fact that few ever see them.

Whisper quiet and vanishing in darkness, felugons have few rivals when it comes to the art of murder.": "有时被称为 \"看不见的人\"，Felugons擅长潜规则和暗杀。当凡人与地狱讨价还价，以消除一个讨厌的对手或免除一个麻烦的配偶时，重刑犯是进行交易的人，并以熟练的方式实施杀戮。然而，如果被出卖，重刑犯就会降临到他们以前的雇主身上，用鲜血和灵魂索取代价。他们被称为 \"看不见的\"，是因为很少有人看到他们。即使被从地狱召唤出来，他们也是以朦胧、模糊的身影出现，明亮的眼睛在头型的阴暗中闪闪发光。窃窃私语，在黑暗中消失，当涉及到谋杀的艺术时，重刑犯几乎没有对手。",

Baal made the Hellwardens to take advantage of this ter rain, giving himself an easily camouflaged spy network. Hellwardens look like horribly crucified devils, often with missing limbs and gaping wounds. Although they appear quite dead, powerful magic keeps them alive. Baal and his commanders plant these spies throughout the First Circle to collect intelligence on their enemies.

Because they aren't much of a threat singly, spinders band together in groups of six or more to better accomplish this goal. The other denizens of Hell react poorly to spinders and attempt to exterminate any packs they find in their vicinity. This prejudice has made the spinders nomadic out of necessity.

They run forward on all fours with their heads down, relying on their spines to deflect any potential ranged attacks. Once they have their prey surrounded (or as close to this as they can get), they leap simultaneously, trying to knock the target down. If the spinders do not have the advantage of numbers, they leave one or more enemies free so that they can gang up on others. Spinders press their attack until they have killed or subdued their foes, unless there is danger of the entire pack being wiped out, in which case they beat a hasty retreat.

Two hands were judged insufficient to accomplish this task, so the vierhaander has four. For all their worth to their masters, vierhaanders are generally not summoned forth except to impress other nobles. They serve in the infernal courts as jesters and whipping boys, a ready form of entertainment for the jaded aristocracy of Hell. Over the centuries, the vierhaanders have lost most of their ability to speak, but they have gained something else: the desire for freedom. There are numerous barriers to this recently discovered need, not the least of which is the fact that their numbers are scattered throughout Hell. Since their tasks only take up a small fraction of their day, however, the vierhaanders have been slowly building up an underground network through which they can communicate. They know that they cannot hope to escape from their servitude by force, so a subtler way of attaining their goal is currently in discussion. Adventurers who are foolish enough to believe they can gain allies by advancing this cause, though, are likely to live only long enough to regret their error. Vierhaanders are seldom seen on the Material Plane. They are a valued commodity and are only given (or, more often the case, loaned) to mortals who have committed truly nefarious deeds in service to Hell. A vierhaander uses such an opportunity to its advantage, trying either to escape or to kill its mortal master.

Just as fiends represent all that is evil and profane, the celestial inhabitants of the Upper Planes embody all that is righteous and benevolent. For the most part, fiends and celestials meet only as combatants, as champions of their mutually exclusive ideologies. Malignancies have a way of spreading, however, and even paragons of purity are susceptible to the beckoning song of sin. Fallen celestials are a paradox. According to the laws of planar philosophy, they should not exist: celestials are made of the essence of goodness. Yet a very, very few do become corrupted by evil. This quandary is perhaps best personified by the solar Iblis, who is thought to have been the first celestial being to fall from grace. In refusing to serve the first mortals, Iblis fell victim to the deadly sin of pride.

There it is permanently trapped, as though with the minimus containment effect of the imprisonment spell. The terms of the compact must be absolutely clear, and the mortal cannot be under any form of magical compulsion, lest the agreement be considered null and void. Acceptance need be no more than a verbal statement that is a free action. Some fallen celestials prefer to draw up a physical contract, but this is an affectation. As soon as the agreement is in place, the Fallen must spend its next action casting the wish spell, which it can only do when a compact is made. Freeing oneself from an unholy compact is nearly impossible. Even a wish spell cannot release the promised soul. A still-living mortal is released only if the Fallen is destroyed or the mortal can somehow convince it to give up its claim without magical compulsion. A fallen angel automatically knows if a given mortal has entered into a compact with another and has little patience with those it knows it cannot corrupt.": "一些强大的堕落天使可以让一个生灵参与到一个亵渎性的协议中。堕落者提供一个巨大诱惑的实现，以换取凡人死亡时的灵魂。当同意这个不神圣的协议的凡人死亡时，他们的灵魂会被带到堕落者在下层世界的领域。在那里，它被永久地困住了，就像监禁咒语的最低限度遏制效果一样。契约的条款必须绝对明确，凡人不能受到任何形式的魔法强迫，否则协议将被视为无效。接受不需要是一个口头声明，是一个自由行动。一些堕落的天人喜欢起草一份实体合同，但这是一种影响。一旦达成协议，堕落者就必须用它的下一个行动来施展愿望咒语，而这只有在契约达成后才能做到。将自己从一个不神圣的契约中解放出来几乎是不可能的。即使是一个愿望咒语也不能释放所承诺的灵魂。只有当堕落者被摧毁或凡人能以某种方式说服它放弃它的要求而不用魔法强迫时，一个仍然活着的凡人才会被释放。堕落天使会自动知道某个凡人是否与另一个凡人签订了契约，并且对那些它知道自己无法腐化的人没有什么耐心。",

	"The stretch of the River Styx that winds its way through the Abyss used to positively teem with hydraggons, the dominant form of aquatic qlippoth. When the celestial host began to ravage the Howling Threshold, legions of hydraggons rose up to fight them and died in a holocaust of holy fire. The remaining hydraggons fled into the depths of the river. Since the Styx is incalculably long, the hydraggons split up and hid in stretches of the river throughout the Lower Planes. The celestial armies dared not follow them to Hell and Hades, lest they touch off a war even they could not win. Thousands of hydraggons were killed by devils, daemons, and other horrors of the Styx, but a core survived and even came to thrive in their adversity. Now hydraggons can be found throughout the River Styx. Although they are clearly of fiendish origin, few know they are from the Abyss. It is rumored that a colony of hydraggons also escaped to the Material Plane, but if this is so, their lair remains well hidden. Hydraggons do not usually congregate in large numbers, since they've found it easier to pass unnoticed in small groups. In dire situations, though, it can be critical for all hydraggons in the area to coalesce quickly. The hydraggons developed their natural telepathic abilities, so now each can create a psychic homing beacon to make the most of their limited numbers.": "冥河蜿蜒穿过深渊的那段河道，曾经充斥着水龙，即水生qlippoth的主要形式。当天人开始蹂躏嚎叫之门时，水龙军团奋起反抗，在圣火的大屠杀中死去。剩余的水鬼则逃进了河的深处。由于冥河的长度不可估量，水母们分裂开来，躲藏在整个下层世界的河段中。天体军队不敢跟随他们到地狱和冥府，以免他们引发一场连他们自己都无法赢得的战争。成千上万的hydraggons被魔鬼、守护神和冥河中的其他恐怖事物所杀害，但有一部分人幸存下来，甚至在逆境中茁壮成长。现在，整个冥河都能找到水龙。虽然它们显然是恶魔的起源，但很少有人知道它们来自深渊。有传言说，有一个水龙的殖民地也逃到了物质界，但如果是这样，它们的巢穴仍然隐藏得很好。水龙人通常不会大量聚集，因为它们发现在小群中更容易不被注意。不过，在危急情况下，迅速凝聚该地区的所有Hydraggons是至关重要的。水母发展了它们天然的心灵感应能力，所以现在每只水母都能创造出一个通灵的归航信标，以充分利用它们有限的数量。",

The noted paladin Flavius was caught in one such hunt, and he and his followers were slain to a man. Belial also periodically releases Balan and his Infernal Hunt onto the Material Plane. This is a real treat for the old devil. He gathers together a pack of fiendish beasts, hell hounds, and devils. They appear at night, howling through the sky and landing to reap souls and cause untold destruction. Each hunt has a special target chosen by Belial (such as a troublesome crusading church), but the Master of the Infernal Hunt has free rein to continue his merry ride until he's had his fill of bloodletting.

Once in charge, he decided to secure his position by increasing the undead forces under his command. There were plenty of corpses to make troops from, and he found their obedience pleasing. Moreover, his fiendish skeletons cannot be turned while in Hell. Now known as the Duke of Unlife, Malgrin has a huge undead horde under his command.

	"Before the angelic rebellion in heaven—before the fall of those angels and their subsequent descent to the Abyss and Hell—there was Ahrimanes. An angel, like so many of his brethren that fell from grace, he never exhibited the purity of his fellow celestials. Despite dwelling in the presence of the gods, he could never accept that these beings could have created him. He watched their bickering and childish behavior in shock, horrified by the power they controlled and disgusted by their capriciousness and infighting. He grew to hate them, and, in his hate, he fomented discord in his kind, forming the first rebellion against the gods. His arrogance allowed him to believe he could walk unchallenged in Heaven, talking freely of the pettiness of the immortal masters and their misguided use of power. He gathered a motley host of sycophants to his side, composed of those who saw things as he did, or perhaps they joined because they saw power in him. When their meetings turned violent, the gods would brook no more offense and demanded that Ahrimanes and his followers be cast out of the Heavens. Those angels who enforced the gods' will were Iblis, Sariel, and Beelzebub, who would eventually rise up against their divine masters when the gods created mortals, inspired by the words of Ahrimanes. Ahrimanes's ejection from the Heavens occurred before Hell was formed and while the qlippoth still ruled unchallenged in the dark, away from the gods. No mortal world yet existed, so Ahrimanes wandered the shadows of the cosmos, too afraid to find shelter with the soulless in the yawning depths of the Abyss. Filled with hatred for all of his kind, he nursed his grief and loneliness for a thousand years, until mortal man first drew his breath on a world created just for him. Soon after, Ahrimanes watched his fellow angels—those that ignored his warnings and cast him from the light of the Heavens—struggle futilely against the combined might of the Heavens. He watched as Asmodeus, his heir, fell from the Heavens to land in a new place, a place of torment and woe, where the gods would give over mortals of similar disposition to the hateful devils. He laughed gleefully when the others fell to the Abyss and struggled for survival against the qlippoth. In the end, with these fiendish realms created and with demons and devils established in their new realms, Ahrimanes returned from his exile and settled in Gehenna, doing his part to corrupt the mortals and send them to their dark masters. He has an uneasy truce with the exarchs, though each suspects he plots to seize the entire plane for his own. Given his charismatic nature and bottomless corruption, it is a threat that all would do well not to ignore.": "在天堂的天使叛乱之前--在那些天使堕落和他们随后下到深渊和地狱之前--有一个阿利曼斯。他是一个天使，就像他的许多堕落的兄弟一样，他从未表现出他的天人伙伴的纯洁。尽管居住在众神面前，他永远无法接受这些生命会创造他。他震惊地看着他们的争吵和幼稚的行为，对他们控制的权力感到恐惧，对他们的反复无常和内讧感到厌恶。他逐渐憎恨他们，在憎恨中，他在自己的同类中煽动不和，形成了对众神的第一次叛乱。他的傲慢让他相信自己可以在天堂里不受挑战，随意谈论不朽的主人的琐事和他们对权力的错误使用。他聚集了一群杂牌军，由那些和他一样看待事物的人组成，或者说他们加入是因为他们在他身上看到了力量。当他们的聚会变成暴力时，诸神不再容忍任何冒犯行为，要求将阿利曼斯和他的追随者赶出天庭。那些执行众神意愿的天使是伊比利斯、萨里尔和别西卜，当众神受阿利曼斯的话启发而创造了凡人时，他们最终会起来反对他们的神灵主人。阿利曼斯被驱逐出天堂是在地狱形成之前，而且当qlippoth仍然在黑暗中不受挑战地统治，远离诸神的时候。当时还没有凡人的世界，所以阿利曼斯在宇宙的阴影中徘徊，不敢在深渊的大渊中与无魂之人一起寻找庇护所。他对所有的同类充满了仇恨，在一千年的时间里，他忍受着悲伤和孤独，直到凡人第一次在一个专为他创造的世界上吸气。不久之后，阿利曼斯看着他的天使伙伴们--那些无视他的警告并将他从天堂之光中驱逐出去的天使--徒劳地与天堂的联合力量斗争。他看着他的继承人阿斯莫德从天庭坠落到一个新的地方，一个充满折磨和悲哀的地方，在那里，众神将把性格相似的凡人交给可憎的魔鬼。当其他人落入深渊，为生存而与qlippoth挣扎时，他幸灾乐祸地笑了起来。最后，随着这些魔界的建立，随着恶魔和魔鬼在他们的新领域建立起来，阿利曼斯从他的流放地回来，在地府定居，尽他的职责腐蚀凡人，把他们送到他们黑暗的主人那里。他与前辈们达成了不安的休战协议，尽管每个人都怀疑他谋划为自己夺取整个平面。鉴于他的魅力和无底线的腐败，这是一个所有人都不应该忽视的威胁。",
