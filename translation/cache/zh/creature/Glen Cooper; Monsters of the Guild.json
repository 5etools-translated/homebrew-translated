In return for this, the necromancer was to help Ras Nasi in his quest for immortality by assisting the infamous lich, Acererak. Acererak was in the process of producing a device that would collect the souls of the fallen of Faerun and feed an entity that could destroy all Toril.

	"Normal folk often mistake an abyssal giant lizard with a normal beast of that variety. However, the abyssal variety is a demon rather than a natural beast, meaning their coloring and odor are often nastier and more revolting. Their scales are tinted purplish-black and their red eyes glow with malice. They reek of brimstone and rot, which spreads with every drop of their poisonous saliva.": "普通人常常会把深渊巨蜥与该品种的普通野兽误认为是一个。然而，深渊巨蜥是一种恶魔，而不是天然的野兽，这意味着它们的颜色和气味往往更恶心，更令人反感。它们的鳞片被染成紫黑色，红色的眼睛闪烁着恶意的光芒。它们散发着硫磺和腐烂的气味，随着它们每一滴有毒的唾液而扩散。",

	"A dokufu is covered with a heavy exoskeleton resembling the rocks of its mountain habitat, allowing it to blend in perfectly with its surroundings. It also has the ability to change the color of its exoskeleton to shades of white to blend in with snowy environments. Its exoskeleton provides the dokufu with ample protection against physical harm, as well as magical harm as the chitin thickens with age.": "独脚兽覆盖着厚重的外骨骼，类似于其山地栖息地的岩石，使其能够与周围环境完美融合。它还有能力将其外骨骼的颜色改变为白色，以便与雪地环境相融合。它的外骨骼为独角兽提供了充分的保护，使其免受物理伤害，以及随着年龄的增长，甲壳素的增厚而受到魔法伤害。",
	"It is unknown how long dokufu live but they can most certainly become several thousand years old. They mature and grow very slowly, becoming immensely large in old age. While a dokufu spiderling is no bigger than a small dog, they are about the size of a panther by the time they become younglings. Once they reach adulthood, they're about as large as a horse and truly ancient dokufu will grow to be the size of a mammoth.": "不知道独角兽的寿命有多长，但它们肯定可以变成几千岁。它们的成熟和成长非常缓慢，到了老年就变得非常大。虽然小独角兽并不比一只小狗大，但当它们成为幼兽时，就有豹子那么大了。一旦它们达到成年，它们就和马一样大，而真正古老的独角兽会长到猛犸象那么大。",
	"If it is discovered that an area is home to a young dokufu, a hunting party is quickly gathered to kill the creature before it matures.

They are greatly feared throughout the world and even speaking their name inspires terror in children and adults alike.": "如果发现一个地区有一个年轻的Dokufu，就会迅速召集一个狩猎队，在它成熟之前杀死这种生物。含有成熟独角兽的地区通常是完全避免的，因为许多伟大的战士曾与独角兽对峙，结果成为其幼崽的炮灰。它们在全世界都非常令人恐惧，甚至说出它们的名字都会让儿童和成年人感到恐惧。",
	"While they might resemble brutish creatures, dokufu are cunning and wise. They have the innate ability to create powerful illusions which they utilize to lure prey closer.

	"Dokufu eyes act as lenses, greatly increasing the potential of their illusory magics. This odd mutation is caused by the massive amount of taint within the creature, which has rendered their eyes useless for seeing but granted it an otherworldly sense for perceiving its surroundings. This fact isn't widely known, however, and more than one warrior has attempted to blind a dokufu adversary only to discover that it wasn't hindered by it in the least.": "Dokufu的眼睛就像镜片一样，大大增加了他们的幻觉魔法的潜力。这种奇怪的变异是由生物体内大量的污点造成的，这使得他们的眼睛无法看到东西，但却赋予了它感知周围环境的超凡感觉。然而，这一事实并不广为人知，不止一个战士曾试图弄瞎独夫的对手，却发现它丝毫不受阻碍。",
	"Dokufu are androgynous. They reproduce by implanting eggs into humanoid bodies to provide food for their young. Deep within caves, they hang the hosts from the ceiling, often while still alive. Shortly before the egg hatches inside the host, the adult dokufu will swallow the host, so the egg can hatch inside its digestive tract.": "Dokufu是雌雄同体的。它们通过将卵植入人的身体来繁殖，为它们的孩子提供食物。在洞穴深处，它们将宿主吊在天花板上，通常是在活着的时候。在卵在宿主体内孵化前不久，成年的Dokufu会吞下宿主，这样卵就可以在其消化道内孵化。",
	"Unless traveling to another region which might provide better hunting grounds, a dokufu usually creates its lair within a cave. While in its lair, a dokufu has access to Lair Actions. An adult dokufu encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 15 (13,000 XP).": "除非前往另一个可能提供更好猎物的地区，否则独狐通常会在山洞中建立自己的巢穴。在巢穴中，独狐可以使用巢穴行动。在巢穴中遇到的成年独狐的挑战等级为15（13,000XP）。",
	"The region containing the dokufu's lair is warped by its powerful illusionary magic, though all of the effects feel real. Creatures with truesight can see through the illusions, however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion. The dokufu itself is unaffected by all detrimental effects. The region contains the following effects:": "包含独夫巢穴的区域被其强大的幻术扭曲了，尽管所有的效果都感觉是真实的。拥有真实视力的生物可以看穿幻象，然而，幻象的所有其他元素仍然存在，所以当生物意识到幻象的存在时，该生物仍然可以与幻象进行物理互动。虚空本身不受所有不利影响。该区域包含以下效果。",
