The rest of the characters can act the roles of bodyguards, assistants, porters, etc. The merchant can be male or female at your discretion.": "其中一个角色（随机选择）与被抓的商人有足够的相似性，以至于卖家（从未见过该商人）很容易被骗。其余的人物可以扮演保镖、助手、搬运工等角色。商人可以是男性或女性，由你决定。",
	"The Harper provides a small sack of fake diamonds that the characters should use to buy the egg. The \"diamonds\" are basically worthless, but good enough to pass a cursory inspection.": "哈珀提供了一小袋假钻石，人物应该用它来买蛋。这些 \"钻石 \"基本上不值钱，但足以通过粗略的检查。",
	"At some point during the exchange, one of the characters must place a small silver pin infused with magic on the seller or one of the crew. Once that is done, the Harpers can more easily scry on the sellers and learn more about their operation.": "在交换过程中的某个时刻，其中一个角色必须在卖家或其中一个工作人员身上插上一枚注入了魔法的小银针。一旦这样做了，哈珀斯人就可以更容易地探查卖主，了解他们的行动。",
	"No real names are used in these transactions, so the two parties will refer to each other as \"the buyer\" and \"the seller.\"": "在这些交易中不使用真实姓名，所以双方会互相称呼对方为 \"买方 \"和 \"卖方\"。",
	"Once the transaction is complete, the characters are to bring the egg back to the stables behind the Tea Kettle, where the Harper will meet them and take possession of it.": "交易完成后，这些人物要把鸡蛋带回茶壶后面的马厩，哈珀将在那里与他们会面并占有它。",
	"Under no circumstances should the characters fight the sellers or harm the egg. The point is to track the sellers, so killing or capturing them is counterproductive.": "在任何情况下，角色都不应该与卖家作战或伤害鸡蛋。重点是追踪卖家，所以杀死或抓住他们会适得其反。",
	"For completing the task successfully and as instructed, the Harper offers the group 200 gp. The sum will be paid upon delivery of the egg.": "对于成功完成任务并按照指示，哈珀为这群人提供了200吉普。这笔钱将在交付鸡蛋后支付。",
	"The Harper agent gives the characters the small pouch of fake diamonds, the magical silver pin, and directions to an abandoned barn on the northern outskirts of Phlan. Answer other questions as best you can. Remember the time pressure, and use that as an in-game excuse to keep the players moving forward. The meeting is scheduled for right now, so there is no time to plan further. The characters must hurry!": "哈珀特工将一小袋假钻石、神奇的银针和前往普兰市北郊的一个废弃谷仓的路线交给了这些人物。尽可能地回答其他问题。记住时间的压力，把它作为游戏中的借口，让玩家们继续前进。会议就安排在现在，所以没有时间进一步计划。角色们必须抓紧时间!",
	"It is a 20-minute walk to the meeting place. When the characters arrive, the sellers are already waiting at the abandoned barn.": "步行到会面地点需要20分钟的时间。当人物到达时，卖家已经在废弃的谷仓里等待。",
	"The barn itself is a simple, open structure, 30 feet wide and 80 feet long. A ladder at the end of the barn opposite the open doorway leads to a hay loft 10 feet above the barn floor. The loft is 40 feet long and the entire width of the barn, directly above the end of the barn opposite the door. Rusted farm implements lean against the barn walls. A {@b secret exit} (known by the sellers) is obscured by burlap sacks on the wall near the ladder opposite the main entrance.": "谷仓本身是一个简单、开放的结构，宽30英尺，长80英尺。在敞开的门口对面的谷仓尽头有一个梯子，通往高于谷仓地面10英尺的干草阁楼。阁楼有40英尺长，与谷仓的整个宽度相同，直接位于谷仓门对面的一端。生锈的农具靠在谷仓的墙上。在正门对面的梯子附近的墙上，一个（%0%）（卖家知道）被麻布袋遮挡住了。",

	"The seller is an elf {@creature spy} who waits with three human {@creature guard|mm|guards}. They have no reason to expect trouble during the sale, but they are wary nonetheless.": "卖家是一个精灵（%0%），和三个人类（%1%）一起等待。他们没有理由认为在销售过程中会有麻烦，但他们还是很警惕。",
	"When the characters enter the barn, the seller calls for the characters to halt when they get within 20 feet of her.": "当人物进入谷仓时，卖家在人物进入她的20英尺范围内时，就叫他们停下来。",
	"A sinewy elf in gray clothes smiles at three humans behind her. \"I told you they would come. A dragon egg is much too valuable to pass up.\"": "一个身穿灰色衣服的筋肉精灵对她身后的三个人类微笑着。\"我告诉你他们会来的。一个龙蛋太有价值了，不能错过。\"",
	"The elf turns back to you. \"Now, let's do this quickly. Here is what you asked for.\" She holds a very large hide backpack toward you.": "精灵回头看你。\"现在，让我们赶快做这件事。这是你要的东西。\" 她拿着一个非常大的兽皮背包走向你。",
	"\"You throw the payment over to me, and we will leave the egg here. We will exit the barn, and then you can leave after five minutes have passed. No fuss, no muss.\" She pauses and looks at you more closely. \"Hold on. Something is not right here.\"": "\"你把钱扔给我，我们就把蛋留在这里。我们将离开谷仓，然后你可以在五分钟后离开。不费吹灰之力，不费吹灰之力。\" 她停了一下，更仔细地看了看你。\"等一下。这里有些不对劲。\"",
	"Inevitably, the elf seller notices something is amiss, namely a single aspect of the character posing as the merchant that looks wrong. It might be the seller expected someone shorter or taller. She might have expected the merchant to have a mole or birthmark-or perhaps she expected the merchant to have a facial tic or strange speech pattern. Whatever you choose, make it something fun or interesting for the characters to have to roleplay or think of an excuse for.": "不可避免的是，精灵卖家会注意到一些不对劲的地方，即冒充商人的人物的某一方面看起来不对。这可能是卖家期望有人更矮或更高。她可能期望商人有一颗痣或胎记，或者她期望商人有面部抽搐或奇怪的说话方式。无论你选择什么，都要让角色不得不进行角色扮演或想出一个借口，让它变得有趣或有意义。",
	"At this point, two skill checks are going to be most relevant during the exchange: a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check and a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.": "在这一点上，在交换过程中，有两个技能检查将是最相关的：DC 10的魅力（欺骗）检查和DC 10的灵巧（灵巧）检查。",
	"One successful Deception check is enough to convince the sellers that the characters are the legitimate buyers. Feel free to give a bonus to the check, or even automatic success, based on outstanding roleplaying.": "一次成功的欺骗检查就足以让卖家相信这些角色是合法的买家。根据出色的角色扮演，可以随意给检查加分，甚至是自动成功。",
	"One successful Sleight of Hand check indicates that a character has planted the silver pin, assuming the characters can come up with a reasonable excuse to get close to the sellers.": "一次成功的神机妙算检查表明，一个角色已经植入了银针，前提是这些角色能想出一个合理的借口来接近卖家。",
	"If at any point the elf believes she is in danger, she simply drops the egg and flees with her guards. She tries to get the diamonds if possible, but not at the risk of her life. The elf and the guards only defend themselves if pressed to do so.": "如果在任何时候，精灵认为她处于危险之中，她会简单地扔下蛋，带着她的卫兵逃走。如果可能的话，她会试图拿到钻石，但不会冒着生命危险。小精灵和卫兵们只有在被逼无奈的情况下才会自卫。",
	"The egg is a fake. Only after the characters take possession of the hide backpack and investigate closely can they even attempt to verify the authenticity of the egg, and even then it is a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. If the egg is thrown to the ground, it gives off a flash of light accompanied by a loud noise which {@condition blinded|phb|blinds} all creatures within 50 feet who do not succeed at a DC 13 Constitution saving throw until the end of their next turn. The elf and her guards are immune to this because they know what it does and can close their eyes in time.": "这个蛋是个假的。只有在人物拿到兽皮背包并仔细调查后，他们才能尝试验证蛋的真实性，即使如此，也要进行DC20智力（自然）检查。如果蛋被扔到地上，它就会发出一道闪光，并伴随着一声巨响，50英尺范围内的所有生物如果没有在DC13宪法约束的情况下取得成功，就会在下一回合结束前受到影响，影响率为%0。精灵和她的卫兵对此免疫，因为他们知道它的作用并能及时闭上眼睛。",
	"Regardless of whether or not the sale goes smoothly, members of the Welcomers-Phlan's thieves guild-come out of hiding to attempt to steal the egg. (They don't bother with the diamonds or any other valuables. They are only interested in the egg.)": "无论销售是否顺利，\"欢迎者\"（Welcomers）--Phlan的盗贼公会的成员都会从藏身处出来，试图偷走这颗蛋（他们并不关心钻石或其他贵重物品。他们只对这颗蛋感兴趣）。",
	"For the mission to run smoothly and in a timely manner, the best time for the Welcomers to interrupt is just after the exchange has taken place, right after the characters likely attempt the Nature check to recognize that the egg is a fake. This lets the sellers leave (or flee) and remain uninvolved in the combat, letting it run more quickly. This also gives the characters the option of simply handing over the egg, thereby avoiding the battle altogether.": "为了使任务顺利和及时地进行，欢迎者的最佳时间是在交换发生后，在人物可能尝试自然检查以认识到鸡蛋是假的之后打断。这可以让卖家离开（或逃离）并保持不参与战斗，让战斗更快进行。这也给了角色们一个选择，那就是简单地交出鸡蛋，从而完全避免了战斗。",
	"The other time to introduce the Welcomers' interruption is if the characters are caught in their deception and are unable to talk their way out of it. The interruption of the Welcomers provides the characters with an opportunity to plant the pin on the seller as she drops the egg and flees with her bodyguards.": "另一个引入 \"欢迎者 \"的时机是，如果人物陷入欺骗之中，而又无法说出口，那么就可以引入 \"欢迎者 \"的打断。欢迎者的打断为人物提供了一个机会，在卖家扔下鸡蛋和她的保镖一起逃跑的时候，把钉子钉在她身上。",
	"The following read-aloud text assumes the Welcomers arrive after the seller and her bodyguards have already left. Adjust as necessary.": "下面的朗读文本假设欢迎者在卖家和她的保镖已经离开后到达。根据需要进行调整。",
	"A voice interrupts you, and a tough-looking half-orc male brandishing a mace appears in the doorway of the barn. \"The toll for passage out of this barn is that egg.

	"The man in the entrance is a half-orc {@creature thug}, who nominally leads the bandit gang. Four {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} are present: the aforementioned two hidden in the loft and two additional bandits waiting outside the barn on either side of the entrance.": "入口处的人是一个半兽人（%0%），他名义上是强盗团伙的领导。有四个人（1%）：前面提到的藏在阁楼里的两个人和另外两个等在谷仓外的入口两侧的强盗。",
	"The two bandits in the hay loft are armed with nets in addition to their normal equipment. They can drop the nets through holes in the loft as an action; each attempting to entangle one character. A character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the net. On a failed save, the targeted creature becomes {@condition restrained}. To remove the condition, the character must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or deal 5 points of slashing damage to the net.": "干草棚里的两个强盗除了正常的装备外，还配备了网子。他们可以将网从阁楼上的洞中投下，作为一个动作；每个人都试图缠住一个角色。一个角色必须做一个DC10的灵巧救赎来避开网。拯救失败时，目标生物会变成（%0%）。为了消除这种状况，角色必须做出DC10力量（运动）的动作，或者对网造成5点切割伤害。",
	"The characters might realize that the egg is a fake, and therefore there is no harm in simply giving the egg to the Welcomers. If this happens, the bandits are initially suspicious, but eventually accept their good fortune at avoiding a fight. The bandits question the characters about why they wanted the egg and intimidate them in an attempt to deter the characters from following them, but otherwise leave peacefully.": "人物可能会意识到鸡蛋是假的，因此干脆把鸡蛋送给欢迎者也无妨。如果发生这种情况，强盗们最初会怀疑，但最终会接受他们避免战斗的好运气。匪徒们质问人物为什么想要这个蛋，并恐吓他们，试图阻止人物跟踪他们，但除此之外，他们会和平地离开。",
	"If the characters give up the egg without a fight, they might finish the event in half the allotted time--or maybe even less. This is probably not a problem.": "如果角色们不战而降，他们可能会在一半的时间内完成活动，甚至可能更少。这可能不是一个问题。",
	"However, if you think the players will be upset about not getting a chance to fight during the session, have the four bandits (but not their leader) follow the characters back to Phlan and attempt to waylay them before reaching the city. Perhaps the bandits realized the egg was a fake and think the characters are hiding the real one somewhere.": "但是，如果你认为玩家会因为在会议期间没有机会战斗而感到不安，可以让这四个强盗（但不是他们的首领）跟随人物回到弗兰，并试图在到达城市之前劫持他们。也许强盗们意识到蛋是假的，认为角色们把真蛋藏在某个地方。",
	"Here are recommendations for adjusting this combat encounter. These are not cumulative. In addition, you can add  one or two of the {@race half-orc}'s racial traits to the thug statistics, although this is not necessary.": "以下是调整这次战斗遭遇的建议。这些并不是累积的。此外，你可以在暴徒的统计数据中加入一到两个（%0%）的种族特征，尽管这不是必须的。",
