Stellarin is a bad neighbor, and his taming of the valley's wild fey nature is spreading.": "如果被问及这个冲突，Stellarin可以假设，也许是因为他是人类，或者是奥术的实践者。这些都不是观察者愤怒的原因。Stellarin是个坏邻居，他对山谷中野性的精灵的驯服正在蔓延。",
	"As the player reveals the reason for their visit, the self-assured Stellarin will exclaim and declare that of course, as a powerful wizard, he can certainly cure Garren of anything that is ailing him, but he will need some components to aid in his diagnosis.

If challenged, he will bashfully confess his fears of leaving the tower for his own safety in an effort to change the subject.

	"The spell to cure Garren calls for a vial of Troll's blood. Stellarin is reasonably sure that there is one of those vile beasts lurking in a cave to the Northeast from the tower. Note, the troll blood needs to be as fresh as possible, so the party should try to bring a part of it back intact. A limb or a head or something...": "治疗加伦的咒语需要一小瓶巨魔的血。斯特拉林有理由相信，从塔楼往东北方向的山洞里潜伏着一只那些可恶的野兽。注意，巨魔的血需要尽可能的新鲜，所以党应该尽量把它的一部分完整的带回来。一个肢体或头颅什么的...",

They do not want to see such an item fall back into the possession of the unscrupulous wizard.": "守护者一直在观察前两个迷你冒险，避免直接干预，但如果玩家找回弯膝，他们肯定会让自己知道。他们会要求角色们交出这个邪恶的物品。他们不希望看到这样的物品重新落入无耻的巫师手中。",

	"In return for the blade, they will offer to help Garren with his condition. His Crystalline Curse is getting worse and Stellarin doesn't seem as capable of helping as he claims, adding urgency to the negotiations. If they agree to give up the knife, the Keepers will offer to escort the party to the Nymph's Grove.": "作为对刀片的回报，他们将提出帮助加伦解决他的病情。他的水晶诅咒越来越严重，而斯特拉林似乎并不像他所说的那样有能力帮助他，这给谈判增加了紧迫性。如果他们同意放弃这把刀，守护者们会提议护送他们去仙女丛林。",

	"Should the player refuse to sacrifice the amulet, Garren will look sad and take the nymph's outstretched hand, moving towards her into the pool with increasing difficulty, his fate uncertain.

	"Should the player sacrifice the amulet, the nymph gestures Garren forward. He looks back at the player with a sad smile, touched by their generosity towards him, and descends into the pool with her. A long silence hangs in the air, when suddenly a darkskinned human male surfaces, gasping for air and pulling himself onto the shore. He is clutching the player's amulet. Garren can explain that it was the idea of the sacrifice, the player's willingness to part with their prized possession, that was sufficient payment for the nymph.": "如果玩家献出护身符，仙女会示意加伦向前走。他回头看了看玩家，露出一个悲伤的微笑，被他们对他的慷慨所感动，然后和她一起下到池子里。空气中弥漫着长久的沉默，突然一个黑皮肤的男性浮出水面，喘着粗气，把自己拉到岸上。他手里拿着玩家的护身符。加伦可以解释说，正是这种牺牲的想法，玩家愿意放弃他们的珍贵财产，才是对仙女的充分回报。",

	"Garren Bronson is a devoted paladin of {@deity Torm}, god of duty, loyalty, and righteousness. He is naturally protective, and his years of military service make him instinctively guard the PC from the dangers they face in the outside world. He is compassionate and insightful, and desires to inspire courage and confidence in those around him. If the PC is nervous or frightened, he will try to comfort them and assure them of their safety, even in the face of danger. Garren will not hesitate to risk his life to protect the PC. He must remain near the PC's Amulet of Binding or be returned to a crystalline state.": "加伦-布朗森是一位虔诚的{@deity Torm}的圣骑士，责任、忠诚和正义之神。他是天生的保护者，多年的军旅生涯使他本能地守护着PC，避免他们在外部世界面临的危险。他富有同情心和洞察力，希望能激发周围人的勇气和信心。如果PC紧张或害怕，他会努力安慰他们，保证他们的安全，即使面对危险。加伦会毫不犹豫地冒着生命危险来保护PC。他必须留在PC的束缚护身符附近，否则就会被恢复成晶体状态。",
	"Note to DM: Garren himself is unaware of this history, but we thought it would be helpful to have something to work from as your campaign and storyline move forward. Though he doesn't remember many of these events, he has still been shaped by them, and they are part of his character. Ideally, Garren will slowly regain his memories and be able to share them with the PC.": "DM注意：Garren本人并不知道这段历史，但我们认为，在你的活动和故事情节向前推进时，有一些东西可以参考，会有帮助。虽然他不记得许多这些事件，但他仍然被这些事件所塑造，而且这些事件是他性格的一部分。理想情况下，加伦会慢慢恢复他的记忆，并能够与个人分享这些记忆。",
	"One of the advantages of Garren not having very many memories is that it creates lots of opportunities for the player, through the PC, to fill in details about the shared world. All of it is new to Garren, and so the player can speak customs and personal or national histories into being during their conversations with the paladin.": "加伦没有太多记忆的好处之一是，它为玩家创造了很多机会，通过PC来填补关于这个共享世界的细节。所有这些对加伦来说都是新的，所以玩家可以在与圣骑士的对话中说出习俗和个人或国家的历史。",
	"As his memories return, Garren may choose different paths for himself, especially because he feels a responsibility to protect the PC. Though in some ways his division between good and evil or conception of justice is rather black and while, he is also wise, thoughtful, and intelligent, and will make a great companion for helping the PC adapt to a life of adventuring.": "随着记忆的恢复，加伦可能会为自己选择不同的道路，特别是因为他觉得有责任保护PC。虽然在某些方面，他对善恶的划分或对正义的概念是相当黑色的，但他也是明智的、有思想的、聪明的，会成为帮助PC适应冒险生活的一个好伙伴。",
	"Back in the years preceding the Spellplague, when the deities sensed a shift among themselves and in the balance of power, select warriors joined the gods' Chosen to further the causes of goodness and justice, the highest callings of their loyalty. These positions of honor exempted the soldiers from a responsibility to a city or nation-state, calling them far from home to engage in epic deeds, risking their lives for the fate of the world.": "早在咒语瘟疫之前的几年里，当神灵们感觉到他们之间和权力平衡的变化时，经过挑选的战士们加入了神选者的行列，以促进善良和正义的事业，这是他们忠诚的最高召唤。这些荣誉职位免除了士兵对城市或民族国家的责任，召唤他们远离家乡，从事史诗般的工作，为世界的命运冒着生命危险。",
	"One such soldier grew up on a farm located in the distant outskirts of a prosperous city. The owners, Erdin and Bratis, took in orphan children who would otherwise fall victim to the more unsavory parts of the city and taught them to till the land and provide for themselves and their neighbors. No one knew the history of the young boy who was brought to their door one chilly night; he seemed as though he had experienced some sort of trauma, and all he could communicate was his name, Garren.": "一个这样的士兵在一个位于繁华城市远郊的农场里长大。农场主埃丁和布拉提斯收留了一些孤儿，否则他们会成为城市中更不光彩的部分的受害者，并教他们耕种土地，养活自己和邻居们。没有人知道这个在一个寒冷的夜晚被带到他们家门口的小男孩的来历；他似乎经历了某种创伤，他所能表达的是他的名字，加伦。",
	"In his later years as a hero, when given the chance to address cheering populaces, he would return to that initial kindness he had been shown by the two men and encourage others to follow their example. Their lack of selfishness saved his life, allowing him to save many others; this was the foundation of his understanding of law and justice.": "在他作为英雄的晚年，当有机会向欢呼的民众讲话时，他会回到这两个人对他最初的善意，并鼓励其他人以他们为榜样。他们的不自私拯救了他的生命，使他能够拯救许多人；这是他对法律和正义的理解的基础。",
	"In Garren's early adolescence, the struggles between the gods and among mortals intensified. Erdin and Bratis, in service to their city, turned their barn into a hospital for wounded soldiers. Garren was enchanted by the battle-hardened men he met, though later he would look back and realize they had only been a few years older than he was at the time. As the battlefields grew ever larger, the recruitment ages decreased, leading to Garren being drafted into a regiment when he was fifteen. He assured his adopted parents that he would be careful, and they watched him striding off to his training camp, unable to shake the feeling that he would never return.": "在加伦的早期青春期，诸神之间和凡人之间的斗争加剧了。埃丁和布拉提斯为了服务他们的城市，把他们的谷仓变成了伤兵的医院。加伦被他遇到的那些身经百战的人迷住了，尽管后来他回过头来才发现他们当时只比他大几岁。随着战场越来越大，征兵的年龄也越来越小，导致加伦在15岁时被征入一个军团。他向他的养父母保证，他会小心的，他们看着他大步流星地去训练营，无法摆脱他将永远不会回来的感觉。",
	"Being naturally tall and strong and hardier still from the labor on the farm, Garren quickly made an impression on his commanders. There was a knowing depth behind the boy's eyes; he had seen and understood much more of the world than his sheltered peers. One promotion followed another, and after a few short years, Garren was made the captain of his own unit. Even better, his first mission would be to return to the city of his birth to protect it from ever-looming threats from the outside.": "加伦天生高大强壮，而且在农场的劳动中更加坚韧，很快就给他的指挥官留下了印象。这个男孩的眼睛后面有一种知性的深度；他比他那些受庇护的同龄人看到和了解的世界要多得多。一个又一个的晋升，短短几年后，加伦被任命为自己部队的队长。更妙的是，他的第一个任务是回到他出生的城市，保护它免受来自外部的不断涌现的威胁。",
	"But the leaders and strategists had once again misunderstood Cyric and his trickery, believing that the city would face its greatest challenge from afar rather than within. Politicians turned against one another, priests betrayed their congregations, neighbors falsely accused one another of crime and absconded with all the family's valuables in the night.": "但领导人和战略家们再次误解了赛里奇和他的诡计，认为城市将从远方而不是内部面临最大的挑战。政客们彼此反目，牧师们背叛了他们的会众，邻居们互相诬陷犯罪，在夜里带着所有家庭的贵重物品潜逃。",
	"In Garren's home, among Erdin, Bratis, and all the children he had regarded as friends and siblings, who looked up to him as their mentor, the deceit took a particularly unfortunate turn. Whether the warriors were bewitched, secret agents, or traumatized beyond discernment, Garren's parents had been right about him not being able to return home; they had just misguessed the reason.": "在加伦的家里，在厄尔丁、布拉提斯和所有被他视为朋友和兄弟姐妹的孩子中，他们把他当作自己的导师，这种欺骗行为发生了特别不幸的变化。不管战士们是被迷惑了，还是被密探，或者是受到了无法辨别的创伤，加伦的父母关于他不能回家的说法是对的；他们只是误解了原因。",
	"One night, as tempers flared throughout the city, several of the wounded soldiers turned on their fellows, creating in-fighting and panic that spread across the farm. The braziers burning in the barn to provide comfort to the weary and wounded in the hours of darkness overturned in the fray, igniting the hay and wood and quickly engulfing the structure. The flames spread across the late summer grasses, dried by the sunny days leading into harvest, and lit the main house and outbuildings as well. Bratis was killed ushering children out of one of the structures when a beam fell and crushed him from above. Erdin, in his dismay searching for his partner, failed to discern that the soldier running at him was not fleeing in terror but sprinting in anger. He turned to show the panicked man the way to safety but was cut down instead. Judging by the footprints, many of the children survived, but the trails to them were lost in the unrest and riots of the city.": "一天晚上，由于整个城市的脾气暴躁，几个受伤的士兵背叛了他们的同伴，造成了内斗和恐慌，并蔓延到整个农场。谷仓里燃烧着的火炉在黑暗中为疲惫不堪的伤员提供安慰，在争斗中翻倒，点燃了干草和木材，迅速吞噬了整个结构。火焰在夏末的草地上蔓延，这些草地被进入收获期的晴天晒干了，并点燃了主屋和外围建筑。布拉提斯在带领孩子们离开其中一座建筑时被砸死，一根横梁从上面砸了下来。埃丁在寻找他的伙伴的过程中，没有注意到向他跑来的士兵不是在惊恐中逃跑，而是在愤怒中冲刺。他转身想给这个惊慌失措的人指明安全的道路，但却被砍倒了。从脚印来看，许多孩子都活了下来，但通往他们的路径在城市的动荡和骚乱中消失了。",
	"Garren returned a few days after the worst of the turmoil subsided. He had pushed his regiment to travel ever faster the last few days on the road, concerned, like his soldiers, that their messages were going unanswered. Even if they had known, they would have been too far away to make it back in time, but such facts proved little comfort.": "加伦在最严重的动乱平息后的几天回来了。在过去的几天里，他促使他的军团在路上走得越来越快，和他的士兵一样，他担心他们的信息没有得到回应。即使他们知道，他们也会因为距离太远而无法及时赶回来，但这样的事实证明并不令人欣慰。",
	"In his anguish at the destruction of his home and all those he held dear, those he had sworn to protect, Garren threw his helmet to the side, crying out as he fell to his knees in frustration. That day, his sword clutched between his hands, his only remaining support, he swore to the gods that if they would allow him, he would enact vengeance on his foes.": "在对他的家园和所有他所珍视的人，那些他曾发誓要保护的人的毁灭的痛苦中，加伦把他的头盔扔到了一边，在沮丧中跪在地上哭喊。那天，他双手紧握着剑，这是他唯一剩下的支撑，他向诸神发誓，如果他们允许他，他将向他的敌人复仇。",
	"The men surrounding him saw a beam of light engulf their leader, so bright they had to shield their eyes and could only just make out his silhouette. Garren, however, witnessed his sword burst into flames and felt himself swell with power. The symbol of a white gauntlet for the right hand emblazoned itself on his shield, covering over the flag of his region - Torm had accepted the warrior's oath and would aid him on his quest.": "他周围的人看到一束光吞噬了他们的领袖，如此之亮，他们不得不遮住眼睛，只能看清他的轮廓。然而，加伦目睹了他的剑爆裂成火焰，并感到自己的力量在膨胀。他的盾牌上印有右手的白色铠甲的标志，盖住了他所在地区的旗帜--托尔姆已经接受了战士的誓言，将在他的探索中帮助他。",
	"The young paladin grew in power, so much so that he surpassed his mentors in record time. His intuition was keen for discerning the greatest threats to the forces of the light, but no amount of success was enough for the raging spirit within the warrior. No amount of good could absolve him of the debts he laid against himself.": "年轻的圣骑士的力量在增长，以至于他在创纪录的时间内超过了他的导师。他的直觉很敏锐，能够辨别出对光明力量的最大威胁，但对于战士内心汹涌的精神来说，再多的成功也是不够的。再好的东西也不能免除他对自己所欠下的债务。",
	"At the height of his own ability, when he was a legendary fighter almost on par with the gods themselves, a clever series of traps were laid before Garren, one of several victims of such schemes. To the dark deities and their allies, Cyric and Shar in particular, the greatest weakness of their foes lay in their dependence on and affection for mortal creatures. But this would prove the moment of their great triumph. They would not kill the warriors outright—no, that would only serve to make them martyrs or invite a show of mercy through resurrection. Instead, Cyric proposed, they would separate the heroes from their souls, making it impossible for them to be resurrected, especially following the sundering of much of Faerun itself.": "在他自己能力的巅峰时期，当他是一个几乎与诸神本身并驾齐驱的传奇战士时，一系列巧妙的陷阱摆在了加伦面前，他是这种计划的几个受害者之一。对于黑暗神灵和他们的盟友，特别是西里克和沙尔，他们的敌人最大的弱点在于他们对凡人生物的依赖和喜爱。但这将证明是他们伟大胜利的时刻。他们不会直接杀死这些战士--不，那只会让他们成为殉道者，或通过复活来显示仁慈。相反，赛里克提议，他们将把英雄与他们的灵魂分开，使他们不可能复活，特别是在法隆的大部分地区被分割后。",
	"Garren was led through a series of dangers, all the while believing he was growing closer to one of the head lieutenants of his enemies. The men and women serving beside him died off one by one to the forces surrounding them until only Garren himself was left. His might weakened and energy spent over the days tracking his prey through the mountains, he fought powerfully and bravely, but it was not enough. However many he struck down, more would take their place. In the final moments of the battle, they taunted him to call down his god, to cry out for aid that he might be avenged or saved. His oath called him to protect and defend the greatest good, and his faith placed Torm above himself. And so Garren stopped, giving himself over to his enemies that his deity might continue on and not be caught up in the Spellplague's destruction.": "加伦被带着经历了一系列的危险，同时相信他越来越接近他的敌人的一个首席副官。在他身边服役的男人和女人一个接一个地死于周围的力量，直到只剩下加伦自己。他的力量被削弱了，在山区追踪猎物的日子里，他耗费了大量的精力，他强大而勇敢地战斗着，但这是不够的。无论他击倒了多少人，都会有更多的人取代他们的位置。在战斗的最后时刻，他们嘲弄他，让他召唤他的神，呼喊援助，使他可能得到报复或拯救。他的誓言要求他保护和捍卫最大的利益，而他的信仰将托尔姆置于自己之上。因此，加伦停下了脚步，把自己交给了他的敌人，以便他的神灵可以继续下去，不被卷入法术瘟疫的毁灭之中。",
	"But all magic comes at a cost. When Cyric and Shar murdered the goddess of magic herself, their own actions spiraled out to Garren and those like him. The bonds holding the souls of the heroes weakened, and the fracturing magic entered a few ancient items. The fleeing gods had heard their heroes' silent cries; they would live on to fight again, one day when the world most needed them.": "但所有的魔法都是有代价的。当Cyric和Shar谋杀了魔法女神本人的时候，他们自己的行为也波及到了Garren和像他一样的人。维系英雄们灵魂的纽带被削弱了，断裂的魔法进入了一些古老的物品。逃亡的诸神听到了他们的英雄们无声的呐喊；他们将继续活着，在世界最需要他们的某一天再次战斗。",
