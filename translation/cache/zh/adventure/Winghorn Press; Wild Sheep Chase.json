	"The party's attempt to grab a rare afternoon of downtime is interrupted by a frantic sheep equipped with a scroll of speak with animals and a fierce determination to get their attention. This is no mere beast, however, but a wizard fallen victim to an embittered apprentice wielding a wand of true polymorph.": "队伍试图抓住难得的下午休息时间，却被一只疯狂的绵羊打断了，它带着一张与动物对话的卷轴，一心想引起他们的注意。然而，这不是一只普通的野兽，而是一个巫师，是一个挥舞着真正的多面体魔杖的愤世嫉俗的学徒的受害者。",
	"Transformed assassins are looking to grab themselves a mutton dinner, while the only object capable of restoring his opposable thumbs lies in the hands of his former pupil and current nemesis. Fortunately, the woolly wizard has found new allies he can rely on, right?": "变形的刺客正在寻找抓住自己的羊肉大餐，而唯一能够恢复他的对立拇指的物体却在他以前的学生和现在的克星手中。幸运的是，这个毛茸茸的巫师已经找到了他可以依赖的新盟友，对吗？",

	"The main text is divided into several distinct scenes, each covering a location, encounter or major plot point. Other information, enemy stat blocks and notes are highlighted in grey boxes.": "正文分为几个不同的场景，每个场景涵盖一个地点、遭遇或主要情节点。其他信息、敌人的状态块和注解用灰色方框突出。",
	"While it is possible to run the game on the fly, it is recommended that you read the adventure in its entirety before starting to play.": "虽然可以即时运行游戏，但建议你在开始游戏前完整地阅读冒险故事。",
	"Getting the players into this adventure is pretty straightforward. All that is requires is that they be spending a few days in a town or city large enough to host a wizard.": "让玩家进入这个冒险是非常简单的。所需要的是他们在一个足以容纳巫师的城镇或城市呆上几天。",
	"If you want to plant seeds in advance, you may wish to introduce the character of Noke through rumours or idle conversation with shopkeepers and innkeepers, who view him with fear and awe.": "如果你想提前埋下种子，你不妨通过传言或与店主和旅店老板的闲谈来介绍诺克这个人物，他们以恐惧和敬畏的眼光看待他。",
	"The adventure begins as the party idle away an afternoon. They might be enjoying a drink at a tavern, resting at their base or simply walking down the street without a care in the world. No matter where they are, however, it soon becomes clear that something quite odd is happening.": "冒险开始了，因为党员们闲置了一个下午。他们可能在酒馆里喝酒，在基地里休息，或者只是无忧无虑地走在街上。然而，无论他们身在何处，很快就会发现发生了一件非常奇怪的事情。",
	"There is a sound of clattering hooves, surprised yelps and a frantic bleating, Before the party can react, a sheep bounds towards them. The beast appears to be a regular sheep in every way - fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns - but it is carrying and elaborate scroll in its mouth.": "一阵哗啦啦的马蹄声、惊讶的叫声和疯狂的咩咩声，还没等一行人反应过来，一只羊就向他们奔来。这只羊从各方面看都是一只普通的羊--蓬松的白毛，黑色的脸，卷曲的角--但它的嘴里却叼着一个精致的卷轴。",
	"The sheep tries to get close to the most magically-gifted member of the party and waves the scroll at them, letting them take it should they reach for it.": "绵羊试图接近党内最有魔法天赋的成员，并向他们挥舞卷轴，如果他们伸手去拿，就让他们拿走。",
	"A wax seal purports that it is a {@item spell scroll|dmg|scroll of} {@spell speak with animals|phb|speak with animals (modified)}. If a character says this out loud - to explain to other party members, for example - the sheep appears to nod and bleat enthusiastically.": "蜡封宣称它是一只（%0%）（%1%）。如果一个角色大声说出这句话--例如向其他党员解释--羊就会出现热情地点头和咩叫。",
	"Should they use the scroll (simply reading it aloud is enough to activate the spell within), all of them hear the sheep's baaing instantly morphs into cultured, elven-accented Common, albeit with a slight hint of a bleat.": "如果他们使用这个卷轴（只需大声朗读就足以激活其中的咒语），所有的人都会听到羊的咩咩叫声立即变成有教养的、带有精灵腔调的普通话，尽管有一丝丝的咩咩声。",
	"After establishing that the player can understand what it's saying, the sheep introduces itself as {@b Finethir Shinebright}, a wizard in dire need of aid. If the players are willing to listen, he explains that he recognises them as adventurers and that he is in dire need of their aid.": "在确定玩家能听懂它在说什么之后，这只羊介绍自己是（%0%），一个急需援助的巫师。如果玩家愿意听，他就解释说他认出了他们是冒险家，而且他急需他们的帮助。",

He will attempt to tell his story, but shortly after he starts the sound of howling fills the air...": "具体来说，他想让他们帮助从一个危险的、可能是疯狂的巫师手中夺回一件极其强大的魔法器物。他将试图讲述他的故事，但在他开始后不久，嚎叫声就充满了空气......",
	"A loud howling fills the air, accompanied by the sound of angry yells and the occaional scream that seem to be drawing closer and closer.": "空气中充满了巨大的嚎叫声，伴随着愤怒的叫声和偶尔的尖叫声，似乎越来越近了。",
	"The cause quickly become apparent as a huge Half-Orc swaggers towards you, pushing his way through the crowd without a care for anybody standing in his way. In front of him walk appear to be large wolves wearing iron collars, while a hulking figure in a dirty brown cloak travels in his wake with footfalls loud enough to be heard over the ruckus.": "当一个巨大的半兽人大摇大摆地朝你走来时，原因很快就显现出来了，他在人群中挤来挤去，对挡在他面前的任何人都不屑一顾。在他前面走着的似乎是戴着铁项圈的大狼，而一个穿着肮脏的棕色斗篷的巨大身影在他后面走着，脚步声响亮，足以在喧闹声中听到。",
	"The Half-Orc sets his small eyes on you and strides forward with one hand resting on the hilt of a greatsword. \"That sheep is Master Noke's... he desires to have it back.": "半兽人将他的小眼睛盯着你，一手搭在大剑的剑柄上，大步向前。\"那只羊是诺克主人的......他想把它要回来。",
	"The Half-Orc, {@creature guz|wsc|Guz}, is accompanied by trio of collared {@creature wolf|mm|wolves} with strangely intelligent eyes, while the huge figure behind him is actually a polymorphed {@creature brown bear|mm}.": "半兽人，{@creature guz|wsc|Guz}，身边有三个长着奇怪的智慧眼睛的领子{@creature wolf|mm|wolves}，而他身后的巨大身影实际上是一个多面体{@creature brown bear|mm}。",
	"He demands that he be given \"Master Noke's sheep,\" which he claimed has escaped, and is of great sent-ee-ment-all value to his master. Any mention of Shinebright's true nature is met with hollow, mirthless laughter.": "他要求把 \"诺克主人的羊 \"交给他，他声称这只羊已经逃走了，对他的主人来说具有极大的送彩金的娱乐平台大全价值。任何关于Shinebright的真实本性的提法都会得到空洞的、无趣的笑声。",
	"Guz is not a bright fellow, but he is very loyal and determined to complete his task. His trackers know that Shinebright is there, no matter how well the party tries to hide him, and will not take no for an answer.": "古兹不是一个聪明的家伙，但他非常忠诚，决心完成他的任务。他的追踪者知道辛布赖特就在那里，无论党派如何努力隐藏他，都不会接受拒绝的答案。",
	"While he prefers violence and intimidation, he is also willing to offer bribes and promises of magical favours if that looks like the best option.": "虽然他更喜欢暴力和恐吓，但如果看起来是最好的选择，他也愿意提供贿赂和魔法优惠的承诺。",
	"If he feels like he's not making progress, Guz will simply attack without warning. The wolves will follow him up, while the cloaked figure will let its hood fall and run into combat with a terrible roar.": "如果他觉得自己没有进展，古兹就会直接攻击，没有任何警告。狼群会跟上来，而斗篷的身影会让它的头巾掉下来，带着可怕的吼声冲进战斗。",
	"The exact details of any battle that breaks out will depend on the location. If it takes place in an inn, tables and overturned chairs litter the floor. In a street, you may wish to have frightened passers-by form zones of difficult terrain.": "任何战斗爆发的确切细节将取决于地点。如果是在客栈里发生的，桌子和翻倒的椅子就会散落在地上。在街道上，你可能希望让受惊的路人形成困难地形的区域。",
	"All of the beasts still have an intelligent human mind contained within them, and act intelligently. Guz is happy to charge into the front line and take on any heavy hitters alongside the Brown Bear.": "所有的野兽体内仍然包含着人类的智能思维，并采取智能行动。古兹很乐意冲进前线，与棕熊一起对付任何重灾区。",
	"Meanwhile the Wolves will aim to cut round behind the party in a bid to grab Shinebright - he uses the statistics of a {@creature pony|mm} but with INT and WIS scores of 18 and 14 respectively.": "同时，狼群将旨在绕到党的后面，试图抓住Shinebright--他使用（%0%）的统计数据，但INT和WIS的分数分别为18和14。",
	"They intend to capture Shinebright, not kill him. If Guz captures him, he and his allies will set off for Noke's home. The party will have to decide if they follow, potentially launching a chase scene.": "他们打算抓捕辛布赖特，而不是杀了他。如果古兹抓住了他，他和他的盟友将向诺克的家出发。党员们将不得不决定是否跟随，这可能会引发一场追逐战。",
	"Arrogant, self-obsessed and filled with an inflated sense of his own ego, Finethir Shinebright is one of the people worst suited to be transformed into a sheep. Still, no matter his form the former elven wizard manages to exude an air of fussy, bookish intellectualism.": "傲慢、自恋，对自己的自我充满了膨胀感，菲奈瑟-辛布莱特是最不适合被改造成羊的人之一。不过，无论他的形态如何，这位前精灵巫师都能散发出一种挑剔、书生气十足的知识分子气息。",
	"Despite his flaws, however, he is generally good-hearted. Assuming he notices them and it doesn't inconvenience him too much he will try to help others where possible, though he will loudly complain of their inability to grasp concepts as simple as poly-planal transweave theory.": "尽管他有缺陷，然而，他一般都是心地善良的。假设他注意到了这些缺点，而且不会给他带来太多不便，他就会尽可能地帮助别人，尽管他会大声地抱怨别人无法掌握像多平面交叉编织理论这样简单的概念。",
	"Once upon a time the local nobles, merchants and arcanists spoke the name of Finethir Shinebright with respect, awe and grudging admiration. A master of transmutation, he would regularly be called upon to carry out grand tasks such as clearing blocked roads by turning massive boulders into rabbits.Two years as a sheep have taught him very little about humility, but a lot about grass. If he returns to his natural form, Shinebright is a willow-thin high elf with straw-coloured hair and an extremely long nose.": "很久以前，当地的贵族、商人和奥术师在谈到菲奈瑟-辛布赖特的名字时，都带着尊敬、敬畏和勉强的钦佩。他是一位变身大师，经常被要求执行宏伟的任务，比如把巨大的石块变成兔子来清理堵塞的道路。两年的绵羊生涯让他学会了很少的谦卑，但却学会了很多的草。如果他恢复到自然形态，Shinebright是一个柳树般纤细的高级精灵，有着稻草色的头发和一个极长的鼻子。",
	"Once Noke's goons have been defeated, distracted or otherwise dealt with, Shinebright pleads with the party. Without their help, he is doomed. Noke still has many guards still working for him and eventually they will find him. If they're feeling mercenary, he reminds the party that in his true form he is a powerful and wealthy wizard and promises great rewards. He is more than willing to commit to deals that he knows he can't actually fulfill. In any case, Shinebright will explain:": "一旦诺克的手下被击败、引开或以其他方式解决，辛布赖特就向党组织恳求。没有他们的帮助，他是注定要失败的。诺克仍有许多卫兵在为他工作，最终他们会找到他。如果他们觉得自己是雇佣兵，他就会提醒队伍，在他的真实形态下，他是一个强大而富有的巫师，并承诺给予巨大的回报。他更愿意承诺那些他知道自己无法实际履行的交易。在任何情况下，辛布赖特都会解释。",
	"Until two years ago he owned and worked out of a tower on the outskirts of town. He was a wizard of no small talent, specialising in transmutation magic. His most prized possession - and probably the key to his success - was an incredibly rare {@item wand of true polymorph|wsc}.": "直到两年前，他还拥有并在城郊的一座塔中工作。他是一个不折不扣的魔法师，专攻转化魔法。他最珍贵的财产--可能也是他成功的关键--是一个极其罕见的（%0%）。",
	"One fateful night he ended from his meditative trance to find his apprentice, Ahmed Noke, standing over him, clutching the wand. Shinebright demanded to know what the boy was doing, but the only noise he could produce was an angry ‘baaaaah'.": "一个决定性的夜晚，他从冥想的恍惚中结束，发现他的徒弟艾哈迈德-诺克站在他身边，紧握着魔杖。Shinebright要求知道这个男孩在做什么，但他唯一能发出的声音是愤怒的'baaaaah'。",
	"The wizard became a virtual prisoner in his own garden. He was forced to graze on nothing but grass and buttercups while hungry wolves and other beasts - actually polymorphed guards - looked on.": "巫师在他自己的花园里几乎成了一个囚犯。他被迫只吃草和毛茛，而饥饿的狼和其他野兽--实际上是多面体的卫兵--在一旁看着。",
	"Last night he felt hope for the first time in many months when Noke left his home without closing the door. Shinebright snuck in, made his way to an old bookshelf and stole the Scroll of Speak to Animals. He then rushed into town with the scroll clenched between his teeth, and was searching desperately for the aura of magic that would indicate someone able to activate the spell when he found the party.": "昨天晚上，当诺克没有关门就离开他的家时，他几个月来第一次感到了希望。欣布赖特溜了进来，来到一个旧书架前，偷走了《对动物说话的卷轴》。然后他夹着卷轴冲进了镇子，当他发现这一行人的时候，他正在拼命地寻找能够表明有人能够激活这个咒语的魔法光环。",
	"In order to turn back into his original form he needs another dose of {@spell true polymorph}. Which means he needs access to his old wand.": "为了变回他的原形，他需要另一种剂量的（%0%）。这意味着他需要获得他的旧魔杖。",
	"His former apprentice still dwells in Shinebright's old home, located just to the south-east of town. He keeps the wand on him at all times and only leaves if he absolutely has to.": "他以前的学徒仍然住在辛布赖特的老家，就在镇子的东南方。他一直把魔杖带在身上，只有在万不得已时才会离开。",
	"He knows his old home's layout intimately, and is more than happy to describe it in endless detail.": "他对自己老家的布局非常了解，而且非常乐意用无尽的细节来描述。",
	"A hulking brute of a half-orc, Guz views violence and intimidation as the only sensible methods for achieving his goals. He also assumes that most people feel the same way, and prefers to get his own violence in first.": "古兹是一个粗壮的半兽人，他认为暴力和恐吓是实现其目标的唯一合理的方法。他还认为大多数人都有同样的感觉，所以他更喜欢先用自己的暴力。",
	"Though to most outside observers he may appear evil, he is incredibly loyal to Noke - who genuinely doesn't care what a creature looks like on the outside - and owes him unswerving devotion.": "虽然对大多数外部观察者来说，他可能看起来很邪恶，但他对诺克非常忠诚--诺克真的不在乎一个生物的外表是什么--并且欠他坚定不移的奉献。",
	"Guz isn't particularly intelligent and can be easily confused by quick-talking foes, though this usually just makes him angrier.": "古兹并不特别聪明，很容易被说话快的敌人所迷惑，不过这通常只会让他更加愤怒。",
	"However, he is also fond of trying to use long, complicated words he has picked up from Noke - though the extent to which he actually understands what they mean is probably up for debate.": "然而，他也喜欢尝试使用他从诺克那里学来的冗长、复杂的词汇--尽管他在多大程度上真正理解这些词汇的含义，可能还有待商榷。",
	"Rather than stone or glass, the house before you seems to have been formed from the living branches of four sturdy oak trees. These have been shaped and woven to create three thick platforms.": "你面前的房子不是石头或玻璃，而是由四棵结实的橡树的活枝形成。这些树枝经过整形和编织，形成了三个厚实的平台。",
	"The lowest of these platforms is roughly 40ft across and sits about 10ft from the ground. The only obvious route up is a gentle slope formed of roots and branches that connects roughly with the main path.": "这些平台中最低的一个大约有40英尺宽，离地面约10英尺。唯一明显的上行路线是一个由树根和树枝组成的缓坡，与主路大致相连。",
	"Branches curl around its base, creating a rough bowl shape around it. From where you stand it's possible to see flowers and small trees growing around its edge.": "树枝围绕着它的底部卷曲，在它周围形成一个粗糙的碗状。从你站立的地方，有可能看到花和小树在它的边缘生长。",
	"By far the largest of the three platforms is the middle one, which looks to be around 60ft across. It is about 20ft above the ground and is fully enclosed with a wall formed from twisting branches. You can see evenly spaced, window-sized gaps, as well as what appears to be a door at the point closest to the garden platform.": "到目前为止，三个平台中最大的是中间的那个，看起来大约有60英尺宽。它离地面约20英尺，用扭曲的树枝形成的墙完全封闭起来。你可以看到均匀分布的、窗户大小的缝隙，以及在最靠近花园平台的地方似乎有一个门。",
	"The final, tallest platform is roughly 30ft above the ground, and is much smaller than the others. It looks to be linked to the central platform by another small slope. Scattered beneath the platforms are two small wooden huts and a large outhouse.": "最后一个最高的平台离地面大约30英尺，比其他平台小得多。它看起来是由另一个小斜坡与中央平台相连。平台下面散落着两座小木屋和一个大外屋。",
	"The path to Noke's Tower cuts off from a main road a few miles out of town, darting off between a gap in the bushes. It is a well-trodden route that soon begins to weave its way between tall oak trees.": "通往诺克塔的道路从镇外几英里处的一条主干道上切断，在灌木丛的缝隙间飞奔。这是一条被人熟知的路线，很快就开始在高大的橡树之间蜿蜒前行。",
	"Anyone who cares to examine the path for tracks will easily see the impression of many feet and paws, with the most fresh sets appearing to match up with the group led by Guz.": "任何有心人都会在这条路上检查足迹，很容易看到许多脚和爪子的印记，最新鲜的一组似乎与古兹带领的队伍相吻合。",
	"The track continues through sparse woodland for perhaps a mile without any sign of habitation. Unless they know what to look for, the party may be somewhat surprised by the view that awaits them when Shinebright's old house appears through the treetops.": "这条小路继续穿过稀疏的林地，可能有一英里，没有任何居住的迹象。除非他们知道要找什么，否则当辛布赖特的老房子从树梢上出现时，等待他们的景象可能会让他们感到有些惊讶。",
	"Noke once hero-worshipped Shinebright and served as his apprentice for many years. However, as time dragged on and on there was never any change in their relationship.": "诺克曾经崇拜辛布赖特的英雄，并作为他的学徒服役多年。然而，随着时间的推移，他们的关系始终没有任何改变。",
	"Decades passed and still the master transmuter treated him like a child, expected to cook, clean and recite answers by rote. When Noke pressed him on it, Shinebright would explain that his was how he had been taught, and didn't seem to register Noke's claims that, as a human, he couldn't spare a century to serve out an apprenticeship.": "几十年过去了，转基因大师仍然把他当作一个孩子，期望他做饭、打扫卫生和背诵答案。当诺克逼问他时，辛布赖特会解释说他是这样被教导的，并且似乎没有注意到诺克的说法，即作为一个人类，他不能抽出一个世纪来完成学徒的工作。",
	"At the same time, Noke began to realise that much of Shinebright's acclaim came not from his own abilities - extensive as they were - but from the Wand of True Polymorph he wielded.": "同时，诺克开始意识到，辛布赖特的大部分赞誉不是来自他自己的能力--尽管它们很广泛--而是来自他挥舞的真多态魔杖。",
	"Eventually he cracked, and turned on his former master before setting himself up as a master wizard. However, a combination of guilt and suddenly unstoppered ambition spelled bad news for his mental state.": "最终，他崩溃了，在把自己打造成一个巫师大师之前，他背叛了他的前主人。然而，负罪感和突然失控的野心相结合，给他的精神状态带来了坏消息。",
	"He is paranoid that someone will attack him as he attacked Shinebright and rarely sleeps. This paranoia has led him to invest in a troop of guards, many of whom he has transmuted into stronger, more bestial forms.": "他偏执地认为有人会像攻击辛布赖特那样攻击他，因此很少睡觉。这种妄想症导致他投资了一支护卫队，其中许多人被他改造成更强大、更兽性的形式。",
	"When the party arrives at the compound, there is a trio of {@creature ape|mm|apes} either sleeping or playing with an oversized pair of dice on the lawn, with iron greatswords stuck into the ground next to them. A {@creature brown bear|mm} is in the outhouse, taking care of business.": "当一行人到达院子时，有三个{@creature ape|mm|apes}要么在睡觉，要么在草坪上玩超大的骰子，旁边有铁制的大剑插在地上。一个（1%）在外屋，正在处理事务。",
	"The door to the central platform is almost always locked, requiring a DC14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) to break down or a DC12 {@item thieves' tools|phb} check to pick. Inside, the area is divided up in to three sections. One contains a combination library and lab, one a sitting room and one dining room/kitchen. Untidy bookshelves line much of the outer walls, and worktables are covered with stacks of ink-spattered notes and complicated anatomical diagrams of various beasts and monsters.": "通往中央平台的门几乎都是锁着的，需要用DC14力量({@skill Athletics})来打破，或者用DC12{@item thieves' tools|phb}检查来撬开。在里面，这个区域被分成三个部分。一个是图书馆和实验室的组合，一个是起居室，一个是餐厅/厨房。外墙的大部分地方都有不整齐的书架，工作台上堆满了墨迹斑斑的笔记和各种野兽和怪物的复杂解剖图。",
	"The tallest platform functions as a bedroom for {@creature Ahmed Noke|wsc|Noke}, containing little beyond a wardrobe, a large wooden bed and a cluttered dressing table.": "最高的平台作为{@creature Ahmed Noke|wsc|Noke}的卧室，除了一个衣柜、一张大木床和一张杂乱的梳妆台外，几乎没有其他东西。",
	"The huts contain one or two beds each, a few of which are oversized, as well as the general detritus of the common men who occupy them.": "这些小屋每间都有一到两张床，其中有几张是超大的，还有住在里面的普通人的一般杂物。",
	"Noke is in the central platform, working furiously on new spells. If he notices the party as they approach he will order them to \"Return the sheep - in return I will not destroy you all.\" If they talk, he will reveal his reasons for hating Shinebright and boast disjointedly of his own achievements. He will also ask if they killed 'my man, Guz' and be visibly upset if they have. Should they refuse to return Shinebright he will order his men to attack.": "诺克在中央平台上，正在疯狂地研究新的法术。如果他注意到聚会的接近，他会命令他们 \"把羊还回去--作为回报，我不会把你们全部摧毁\"。如果他们交谈，他就会透露他憎恨辛布赖特的原因，并不连贯地吹嘘自己的成就。他还会问他们是否杀了 \"我的人，古兹\"，如果他们杀了，他会明显感到不安。如果他们拒绝归还Shinebright，他将命令他的手下进行攻击。",
	"The most important part of any fight that breaks out is Noke, who is offensively weak but can buff his allies dramatically. Once the brown bear emerges from the outhouse he will cast {@spell enlarge/reduce} on it to increase its damage. He will supplement his minions' attacks with {@spell ray of frost} but will focus on keeping up concentration.": "在任何爆发的战斗中，最重要的部分是诺克，他的攻击力很弱，但可以给他的盟友大幅加血。一旦棕熊从外屋出来，他就会对它施放{@spell enlarge/reduce}以增加其伤害。他将用{@spell ray of frost}来补充他的小弟的攻击，但会专注于保持注意力。",
	"The apes will act intelligently, and as they are wielding greatswords, their Fist attack is replaced by a Slash that deals 10 ({@damage 2d6+3}) slashing damage. They aren't likely to fight to the death and will flee once they fall below half health.": "猿猴会聪明地行动，由于它们挥舞着大剑，它们的拳头攻击被砍击所取代，造成10（（%0%））的砍击伤害。它们不可能拼死抵抗，一旦生命值降到一半以下就会逃跑。",
	"Once it is clear that the fight is lost, or a player simply gets too close to him, Noke will cast {@spell expeditious retreat} and flee into the central platform, locking the door behind him. He will move to his bedroom as fast as he can, and casts {@spell true polymorph} on the largest thing he can find - his bed.": "一旦战斗明显失败，或有玩家简单地离他太近，诺克就会施放{@spell expeditious retreat}并逃进中央平台，锁上身后的门。他将以最快的速度移动到他的卧室，并对他能找到的最大的东西--他的床施放（%1%）。",
	"Three rounds after he runs away he bursts from the roof of his bedroom riding the {@creature bed dragon wyrmling|wsc}, a beast that looks like a dragon carved from wood, with billowing bedsheets for wings and a tail that ends in a soft pillow. If the party are in the main living area he will crash through the ceiling and attack.": "在他逃跑后的三个回合，他骑着（%0%）从卧室的屋顶冲了出来，这只野兽看起来像一条用木头雕刻的龙，翅膀是波浪形的床单，尾巴的末端是一个软枕。如果当事人在主生活区，他就会撞开天花板并进行攻击。",
	"The Wyrmling is not that smart and will use its Splinter Breath as often as possible, simply trying to attack the closest target when it is not available. It will, however, prioritise enemies that use fire against it. While riding the wyrmling, Noke will simply use ray of frost to slow down any party members trying to retreat.": "巫妖并不那么聪明，它会尽可能多地使用它的分裂之息，在没有分裂之息的情况下，只是试图攻击最近的目标。然而，它将优先考虑对它使用火焰的敌人。在骑着暴龙的时候，诺克会简单地使用冰霜之光来减缓任何试图撤退的党员。",
	"Should the Wyrmling be lost–either to damage or because Noke loses concentration–it will turn back into a thoroughly beaten-up old bed. Desperate and unwilling to let his old master win, a babbling Noke will then attempt to use the wand on himself, intending to transmute his form into that of some monstrous creature.": "如果Wyrmling失去了--要么是被损坏，要么是因为Noke失去了注意力--它将变回一张被彻底击败的老床。绝望而又不愿意让他的老主人获胜，胡言乱语的诺克会试图在自己身上使用魔杖，打算将他的形态转化为某种畸形的生物。",
	"However, the over-used wand will crackle, fizz and malfunction with a loud bang, turning Noke into a {@creature gibbering mouther} - a misshapen pile of flesh that bellows incoherently from dozens of mouths. The sad creature will attack mindlessly until completely destroyed.": "然而，过度使用的魔杖会发出噼里啪啦的响声，并发生故障，把诺克变成一个（%0%）--一堆畸形的肉，从几十张嘴里不连贯地发出喇叭声。这个可悲的生物会无意识地攻击，直到完全摧毁。",
	"Noke is naturally paranoid and Shinebright's recent escape hasn't exactly improved his outlook. This makes luring him away from the safety of his tower an extremely difficult task, though not an impossible one.": "诺克是天生的偏执狂，而辛布赖特最近的逃跑并没有完全改善他的前景。这使得引诱他离开他的塔的安全是一项极其困难的任务，尽管不是不可能的。",
	"Noke's lust for fame and power slightly outweighs his fear of being unseated, for the time being at least. This means that a very, very skilled set of liars with a sufficiently devious plan and a good helping of luck may be able to tempt him with the offer of a particularly prestigious, lucrative contract.": "诺克对名声和权力的渴望，至少在目前来说，略微超过了他对被推翻的恐惧。这意味着，一个非常、非常熟练的骗子，如果有足够狡猾的计划和良好的运气，可能会用一份特别有声望、有利可图的合同来诱惑他。",
	"Even so, when Noke leaves he will take all of his remaining bodyguards with him and will be extremely quick to suspect the party of betrayal if there is any hint of a double-cross. He will, of course, have his wand to hand at all times. Should he be given enough time to cast it, Noke will use a charge of true polymorph to transmute some nearby item into a wyrmling that uses roughly the same stats as the {@creature bed dragon wyrmling|wsc}.": "即便如此，当诺克离开时，他将带着他剩下的所有保镖，如果有任何背叛的暗示，他将极快地怀疑当事人的背叛。当然，他的魔杖会一直在手边。如果他有足够的时间施展，诺克会用一个真正的多态性的电荷将附近的一些物品转化成一个巫妖，这个巫妖的属性与（%0%）大致相同。",
	"Depending on what it was made from, it may not have the same flavour and might need to have its resistances/vulnerabilities tweaked slightly.": "取决于它是由什么制成的，它可能没有同样的味道，可能需要对其抵抗力/脆弱性稍作调整。",
	"Should the players recover the {@item wand of true polymorph|wsc|wand} it becomes immediately obvious that it is damaged. Anyone proficient in {@skill Arcana} can tell that it has been modified so it can be used more often, but overuse has rendered it extremely unreliable.": "如果玩家恢复了{@item wand of true polymorph|wsc|wand}，就会立即发现它已经损坏。任何精通（%%）的人都能看出它被修改过，所以可以更频繁地使用，但过度使用已经使它变得非常不可靠。",
	"If they wish to speak to Shinebright, a quick search of the central platform will allow them to find another scroll of speak with animals. At the sight of his former apprentice's ruined corpse, Shinebright may even undergo some realisation of how poorly he treated his former apprentice and turn somber despite his triumph.": "如果他们想和Shinebright说话，在中央平台上快速搜索一下就能找到另一个与动物对话的卷轴。在看到他的前徒弟被毁坏的尸体时，Shinebright甚至会意识到他对他的前徒弟是多么的差劲，尽管他取得了胜利，但还是变得阴郁。",
	"Even if he is made aware of the dangers associated with his old wand, Shinebright will still be willing to risk his life in order to be turned back into an elf. However, he is also open to persuasion if the party try to talk him out of it. A compelling argument and a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) will be enough to make the former wizard reconsider his options.": "即使他被告知与他的旧魔杖有关的危险，辛布赖特仍然愿意冒着生命危险来变回精灵。然而，如果当事人试图说服他，他也愿意接受劝说。一个令人信服的论据和DC15魅力（（%0%））足以让这个前巫师重新考虑他的选择。",
	"Before undergoing the risk of having the spell performed on him, Shinebright will ask that if he does die, the party send word to his old college.": "在接受对他施法的风险之前，辛布赖特会要求如果他真的死了，党会给他的老学院发消息。",
	"{@b If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it succeeds}, Shinebright congratulates the party heartily. He will have to be reminded of anything he actually promised them while he was still a sheep, and cannot actually pay any financial reward, as Noke was virtually bankrupt and had sold most items to pay for research materials and guards.": "{@b If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it succeeds}，辛布赖特衷心地祝贺了党。他要提醒的是，当他还是一只羊的时候，他实际上已经答应了他们的任何事情，而且不能实际支付任何经济奖励，因为诺克几乎破产了，已经卖掉了大部分物品来支付研究材料和卫兵。",
	"He will, however, be willing to perform transmutations of up to 5th level for them, charging just enough to cover thecomponents. He will also take in any polymorphed guards who fled, promising to work towards returning them to their natural shapes.": "然而，他愿意为他们进行五级以下的转化，收费只够支付部件的费用。他还会收留任何逃亡的多面体卫兵，并承诺努力使他们恢复自然形态。",
	"{@b If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it fails}, Shinebright dies permanently. The party is free to honour his final wish and leave the tower more-or-less intact, or loot to their hearts' content. The tower is surprisingly empty of anything of benefit to non-transmuters, however, with valuables restricted to expensive lab equipment and arcane paraphernalia estimated to be worth around 1,000gp. If the players wish they can also take the entire tower complex as their own, though this may cause trouble when the local nobles try to pay Noke a visit and find him missing...": "{@b If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it fails}，Shinebright将永久死亡。当事人可以自由地尊重他的遗愿，或多或少地离开塔，或随心所欲地掠夺。然而，令人惊讶的是，塔里没有任何对非传送者有益的东西，有价值的东西仅限于昂贵的实验室设备和奥术用具，估计价值在1,000gp左右。如果玩家愿意，他们也可以将整个塔楼作为自己的财产，不过当当地贵族试图拜访诺克并发现他失踪时，这可能会引起麻烦......",
	"{@b If the party refuse to perform the spell}, Shinebright accepts but will not give up his hopes entirely. He will take back his old home and work towards a way to remove his curse. In any case, he heads to the bedroom and slips on one of his old robes, which he wears until he is transformed back to his natural shape. Though he will be upset with them, Shinebright will acknowledge that he owes the party a large debt.": "{@b If the party refuse to perform the spell}，Shinebright接受了，但不会完全放弃他的希望。他将夺回他的老家，并努力寻找消除诅咒的方法。在任何情况下，他都会走向卧室，穿上他的一件旧长袍，直到他变回他的自然形状。虽然他会对他们感到不满，但辛布赖特会承认他欠了党的一大笔债。",
	"In any case, any adventurers that help Shinebright to deal with Noke each recieve 500xp.": "在任何情况下，任何帮助Shinebright对付Noke的冒险者都可以获得500个经验。",
	"A stealthy party may be able to steal the wand while Noke sleeps or a combination of lucky roles and inventive tactics may allow a player to disarm the wizard.": "隐蔽的一方可能会在诺克睡觉的时候偷走魔杖，或者幸运的角色和创造性的战术相结合，可能会让玩家解除巫师的武装。",
	"Should this happen, don't force the story back towards the 'ideal path', but allow it to develop naturally.": "如果发生这种情况，不要强迫故事回到 \"理想的道路 \"上，而是让它自然发展。",
	"One thing that you must do, however, is try to provide at least a hint of the dangers associated with the modified wand before the players try and use it. Possibly it sparks unnaturally when a character touches it, or Noke himself may feel honourbound to warn them.": "然而，你必须做的一件事是，在玩家尝试使用改造过的魔杖之前，至少要提供一丝与之相关的危险性的提示。可能当角色接触到它时，它会产生不自然的火花，或者诺克本人可能觉得有责任警告他们。",

	"Formed of a long, thin twig taken from an oak tree, this wand holds {@dice 1d4-1} charges of {@spell true polymorph}, with a minimum of 1. These can be cast by anybody with a spellcasting ability who has spent at least one hour attuning to the wand. The amount of charges resets at dawn each day.": "这根魔杖由橡树上的一根细长的树枝组成，它可以容纳{@dice 1d4-1}%1%的能量，最小为1。充电量在每天黎明时分重新设定。",
	"In order to increase the amount of times the spell has been cast, the wand appears to have been fitted with a bulbous, rune-inscribed iron band and has cracks running along its length.": "为了增加施法的次数，这根魔杖似乎被装上了一个球状的、刻有符文的铁带，并有裂缝沿其长度方向延伸。",
	"If inspected with a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, reveal that the modifications have left the wand extremely unreliable. Each time a charge is used the user must pass a DC 17 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.": "如果用DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查，会发现修改后的魔杖非常不可靠。每次使用电荷时，使用者必须通过DC17智力（{@skill Arcana}）的检查。",
	"If they succeed, the spell casts normally and the DC needed to use it permanently increases by 1.": "如果他们成功了，法术就会正常施展，并且永久使用它所需的DC增加1。",
	"If they fail by five or less, the spell will transmute the target into a {@creature gibbering mouther} - a hideous lump of seemingly random limbs, organs and facial features. The creature will attack the nearest target mindlessly, babbling in dozens of broken voices.": "如果他们失败了5次或更少，该咒语将把目标转化为一个（%0%）--一个由看似随机的肢体、器官和面部特征组成的狰狞肿块。这个生物会无意识地攻击最近的目标，用几十个破碎的声音喋喋不休。",
	"This transformation cannot be undone by any spell lower than 9th level and cannot be cancelled by ending concentration. The target can make a saving throw against this effect in the same way they would against a regular casting of true polymorph. If they fail by more than five, in addition to the above consequences the wand explodes violently, dealing {@dice 1d12} force damage to all creatures within 10 ft for each charge remaining in the wand. This destroys the wand.": "这种转变不能被任何低于9级的法术所撤销，也不能通过结束注意力来取消。目标可以对这个效果进行蓄力，就像他们对真正的多态性的普通施法一样。如果他们失败超过5次，除了上述后果外，魔杖会发生剧烈的爆炸，对10英尺内的所有生物造成{@dice 1d12}的力量伤害，而魔杖中的每一个电荷都是如此。这将破坏魔杖。",
	"Guz can choose to gain advantage on all melee weapon attacks during his turn, but in return all attack rolls against him also have advantage until the start of his next turn.": "古兹可以选择在他的回合中的所有近战武器攻击中获得优势，但作为回报，所有针对他的攻击卷也有优势，直到他的下一个回合开始。",
