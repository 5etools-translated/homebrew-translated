	"The ancient red dragon Tostrasz the Enormous' youngest wyrm, Defroksanz, was gifted the dungeon Quabus on his 100th hatching day. For Great Chromatics, a dungeon is a rite of passage. And Defroksanz made sure to make Quabus one of the most formidable dungeons in all of Omeria. The first level of Quabus was its prison. Defroksanz's minions would capture commoners across The Summer Land and inter them there. Next, came the death trap second level, Violent Delights. Defroksanz and his associates would watch their prisoners try to escape the deadly obstacle course, watching them on viewing screens. Finally, the third level acted as Defroksanz's research and development center.  There, the dragon expended its sorcerous energies to unlock the mysteries of the Cosmos.": "古老的红龙托斯特拉兹（Tostrasz the Enormous）最年轻的巫妖Defroksanz，在他孵化的第100天被赠予地牢Quabus。对于大色狼来说，地牢是一种成年仪式。而Defroksanz确保使Quabus成为整个Omeria最可怕的地牢之一。Quabus的第一层是它的监狱。德夫罗克桑兹的爪牙会在整个夏日之地捕获平民，并把他们关在那里。接下来，是死亡陷阱的第二层，暴力的乐趣。Defroksanz和他的同伙会看着他们的囚犯试图逃离这个致命的障碍物，在屏幕上观察他们。最后，第三层作为Defroksanz的研究和开发中心。 在那里，巨龙耗费其巫术能量来解开宇宙的奥秘。",
	"Following Defroksanz's defeat during the War of the Burning Plains, Quabus sat unmanaged for decades. The dungeon was rediscovered by one of Defroksanz's descendants, Skuvan the Firesoul Skuvan cleared a path to the old scrying temple on Violent Delights. However, neither he nor any of his minions dared go below the second layer.": "在燃烧平原的战争中，德弗罗桑兹被打败后，夸布斯在数十年间无人管理。地牢被德弗罗桑兹的一个后裔重新发现，火魂斯库凡（Skuvan the Firesoul Skuvan）清理出一条通往暴力喜悦（Violent Delights）上的古老窥探神庙的道路。然而，他和他的任何部下都不敢进入第二层以下。",
	"The research labs are overrun with all sorts of dangers.  Within its dark halls live bizarre aberrations, berserk constructs, conjured fiends, and creatures from The Low who've staked a claim in Quabus.": "研究室里充斥着各种各样的危险。 在黑暗的大厅里，住着奇异的反常者、狂暴的构造物、被施了魔法的恶魔，以及来自低地的生物，他们在Quabus建立了自己的主张。",
	"Of course, the real danger of this layer of Quabus is the rumored presence of Defroksanz's phylactery, a large diamond named The Necrostone. The spirit of the dungeon's former owner now searches the ruins of his old laboratories for a way to return to life through lichdom. If successful, Defroksanz will certainly bring doom on The Summer Land and potentially all of Omeria.": "当然，这层Quabus的真正危险在于传闻中Defroksanz的法器的存在，一颗名为Necrostone的大钻石。地牢前主人的灵魂现在在他的旧实验室的废墟上寻找一种通过巫术恢复生命的方法。如果成功的话，Defroksanz肯定会给夏日之地，甚至是整个奥美利亚带来厄运。",

	"One of the characters experiences a dream. In the dream, a two-headed mantis warns the character that the dragon, Defroksanz, will soon revive itself.

	"A scholar, Keshud Bosteid wants a detailed map of the third level of the dragon dungeon Quabus. He offers a 3,000 gp reward to anyone that can fulfill this request.

	"Beyond the prison and Violent Delights lie Defroksanz's laboratories and research rooms.  The Great Chromatics, unhindered by the arcane laws of The Summer Land, applied the dark arts of conjuration, transmutation, and black necromancy to create new, fantastic horrors with which they could torment humanoidkind.": "在监狱和 \"暴力的乐趣 \"之外，是Defroksanz的实验室和研究室。 大色魔不受 \"夏日之地 \"的神秘法律的阻碍，运用魔法、转化和黑色死灵的黑暗艺术来创造新的、奇妙的恐怖，以折磨人类。",
	"The research level was managed by an Aspaethan Transmuter named Dambudzo. Dambudzo was obsessed with Loikiel, the Archtransmuter Conquerer who nearly destroyed all of Omeria in the 7th century. Having fled her homeland after being chased away by the witchhunters, she was kidnapped by Defroksanz and his minions. Proving her worth, she convinced the dragon to give her a position as a researcher. After a year of impressive service, Defroksanz promoted Dambudzo to the director of arcane research and expanded Quabus so she could expand her studies.": "研究层是由一个叫丹布佐的阿斯帕桑转生者管理的。丹布佐对洛伊基尔非常着迷，这位大传教士征服者在7世纪几乎摧毁了整个奥美利亚。在被猎巫者赶走后，她逃离了自己的家园，被德夫罗桑兹和他的爪牙绑架。为了证明自己的价值，她说服了龙给她一个研究员的职位。经过一年令人印象深刻的服务，Defroksanz将Dambudzo提升为奥术研究主任，并扩大了Quabus，以便她能够扩大她的研究。",
	"When Quabus fell into disarray following the death of Defroksanz, Dambudzo sealed herself in her chambers and drank a potion of her own design to turn her into an immortal creature. The potion gave her eternal life, but it also changed her into a frightful monster. Plus, the transformation drove her insane. Years later, she continues to thrive in the dark, developing aberrations worthy of Loikiel himself. She employs a host of grimlocks who worship her like a god.": "当奎布斯在德弗罗桑兹死后陷入混乱时，丹布佐把自己封在寝室里，喝下了她自己设计的药水，把她变成了一个不朽的生物。这种药水给了她永恒的生命，但也使她变成了一个可怕的怪物。此外，这种转变还使她陷入疯狂。多年以后，她继续在黑暗中茁壮成长，发展出不逊于洛伊基尔本人的畸形。她雇佣了一大批像神一样崇拜她的狰狞的人。",
	"If the characters played through the first two chapters of Into Quabus, likely they discovered the staircase that leads down to the research level via area 31 in Violent Delights. However, if this is the characters' first experience with the Into Quabus adventure path, you can have them circumvent the first two layers and explain that the stairs below Old Blire Manor lead directly into the research level.": "如果角色们玩过《进入夸布斯》的前两章，他们很可能发现了通过《暴力的乐趣》中的31号区域通往研究层的楼梯。但是，如果这是角色们第一次经历 \"进入夸布斯 \"的冒险之路，你可以让他们绕过前两层，解释老布利尔庄园下面的楼梯直接通向研究层。",
	"Unless stated otherwise, the research level of Quabus has the following features.": "除非另有说明，Quabus的研究水平具有以下特点。",
	"Quabus' chambers were hewn from the stone and loose earth below the region where Old Blire Manor now stands. The walls, floors, and ceilings were then dressed with limestone bricks. The ceilings are 10 feet high in passages and 15-feet high in chambers and braced with timbers. Doorways are 7-feet high and 4-feet wide to allow for the dungeon's larger patrons to pass through unhindered Thanks to frequent earthquakes in the region, cracks in the ceilings, floors, and walls are common.": "夸布斯的房间是从老布利尔庄园现在所在的地区下面的石头和松土中凿出来的。然后用石灰石砖对墙壁、地板和天花板进行了修整。通道的天花板有10英尺高，房间的天花板有15英尺高，并且用木材支撑。门口有7英尺高，4英尺宽，以使地牢的大型顾客能够畅通无阻地通过。由于该地区经常发生地震，天花板、地板和墙壁的裂缝很常见。",
	"All of the dungeon's doors are made from solid oak and hung on iron hinges (AC 15, 25 hp, immunity to poison and psychic damage) At the center of each door is a small window that allows creatures to view whatever is on the other side of the door. Most of the doors can be locked A locked door can be broken open by a character who uses their action to make a successful DC 17 Strength check. Or a character can use his or her action to make a DC 15 Dexterity check using proficiency in thieves' tools to pick the lock.": "地牢的所有门都是由坚固的橡木制成的，挂在铁铰链上（AC15，25HP，对毒药和精神伤害免疫）在每扇门的中心有一个小窗口，允许生物查看门另一边的东西。大多数门都可以被锁住。一个被锁住的门可以被一个角色用他们的行动来成功地进行DC17力量检查来打开。或者一个角色可以用他或她的行动做一个DC15的灵巧检定，使用熟练的盗贼工具来撬锁。",
	"Like many of the Great Chromatic's secret lairs, all of the dungeon's manmade chambers and passageways are protected from magic that would allow intruders to enter. Any spell that would allow a creature to enter or leave the dungeon or transport itself from one level to another such as {@spell astral projection}, {@spell plane shift}, {@spell teleport}, or {@spell word of recall} fail.  Similarly, effects that banish creatures to another plane of existence do not work. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts as well However, spells that allow movement between The Ethereal such as the {@spell etherealness} spell still work. Conjuration spells and other magical effects that summon creatures into the dungeon still function, as does magic that utilizes extradimensional space such as {@spell mordenkainen's magnificent mansion||magnificent mansion} or {@item bag of holding||bags of holding}. However, spells cast within those spaces are subjected to the same restrictions as the rest of the dungeon. Finally, the dungeon, its contents, and any creature currently inside the dungeon cannot be detected by divination spells or magical effects used outside the dungeon. Spells such as {@spell locate object} or {@spell scrying} simply fail. The same goes for magic items that duplicate those effects or innate tracking features such as an invisible stalker's Faultless Tracker feature. However, all of these effects work so long as both the caster/user and target are inside the dungeon.": "像许多大色狼的秘密巢穴一样，地牢的所有人造房间和通道都受到保护，不允许入侵者进入的魔法。任何能让生物进入或离开地牢或将自己从一层传送到另一层的法术，如（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）或（%3%）都会失败。 同样地，将生物放逐到另一个存在平面的效果也不起作用。这些限制也适用于魔法物品和人工制品。然而，允许在虚空之间移动的法术，如{@spell etherealness}法术仍然有效。召唤生物进入地牢的法术和其他魔法效果仍然有效，利用超维空间的魔法也是如此，如（%5%）或（%6%）。然而，在这些空间内施展的法术受到与地牢其他地方相同的限制。最后，地牢、地牢里的东西以及目前在地牢里的任何生物都不能被地牢外使用的占卜法术或魔法效果所发现。诸如{@spell locate object}或{@spell scrying}之类的法术会直接失效。复制这些效果的魔法物品或天生的追踪功能也是如此，例如隐形跟踪者的无误追踪功能。然而，只要施法者/使用者和目标都在地牢内，所有这些效果都是有效的。",
	"The research level has torches hung throughout, but very few are lit. The boxed text descriptions assume that the characters have darkvision or their own sources of light.": "研究层到处都挂有火把，但很少有火把被点燃。框内的文字描述假定人物有暗视能力或自己的光源。",
	"Random sounds and peculiar smells are common occurrences on this level of Quabus. Screeches from strange things hiding in the dark might happen at any time, regardless of the presence of a creature. Smells range from sweet and enticing to horrible and vomit-inducing.": "随机的声音和奇特的气味在这个层次的Quabus上是常见的。躲在黑暗中的奇怪东西发出的尖叫声可能会在任何时候发生，不管是否有生物存在。气味的范围从甜美诱人到可怕的呕吐物。",
	"Like wild yeast, rogue transmutation energy permeates this level of Quabus. Each character must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour they spend on this level or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour--this includes resting. If the characters use magical protection while resting, such as that offered by the {@spell leomund's tiny hut||tiny hut} or {@spell mordenkainen's magnificent mansion||magnificent mansion} spells, they do not have to make the saving throw. Resting in this way or leaving the level for at least 1 hour or more resets the DC to 5.": "像野生酵母一样，流氓转化的能量渗透到Quabus的这一层。每个角色在这一层所花的每一小时结束时，都必须成功地进行宪法救赎，否则会获得一级的疲惫。第一小时的DC是5，每增加一小时增加1--这包括休息。如果人物在休息时使用了魔法保护，例如{@spell leomund's tiny hut||tiny hut}或{@spell mordenkainen's magnificent mansion||magnificent mansion}法术提供的保护，他们就不必进行蓄力投掷。以这种方式休息或离开该等级至少1小时或更长时间，则DC会重置为5。",
	"If a character reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a gibbering mouther. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.": "如果一个角色达到6级的疲惫程度，它就会死亡，并立即转变为一个胡言乱语的人。身体的转变只有通过愿望法术才能解除。",
	"The third level is filled with all sorts of horrors lurking in the dark waiting for unsuspecting creatures to stumble into their paths.": "第三层充满了各种潜伏在黑暗中的恐怖，等待着毫无戒心的生物跌入它们的轨道。",
	"Every 10 minutes that the characters spend roaming through this layer, roll a {@dice d20}. On a result of 19-20, a random encounter happens. Choose a random encounter or roll randomly using the Research Level Random Encounter table below to determine the nature of the encounter.": "角色每在这一层漫游10分钟，就掷一次（%0%）。当结果为19-20时，会发生一个随机遭遇。选择一个随机遭遇，或者使用下面的研究水平随机遭遇表随机滚动，以确定遭遇的性质。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of the Research Level of Quabus{@homebrew |as shown on page [x]}.": "以下地点的关键是夸父的研究水平的地图{@homebrew |as shown on page [x]}。",
	"When the characters first enter this area from the staircase leading back to the second level, read or paraphrase the following:": "当人物第一次从通往第二层的楼梯进入这个区域时，请阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"The stairs deposit you into a colossal, diamond-shaped room measuring 60-feet on each of its sides. Four columns hold the 80-foot high ceilings aloft. At the center of each wall, four passages break away from the room, each one headed toward one of the cardinal directions. At the diamond's three corners that don't bear the staircase upon which you just descended stand four tall statues. The southernmost statue is carved to look like a red dragon, its fangs bared. The westernmost statue looks like a beautiful woman wearing long, flowing robes, her arms cross in front of her chest. And the easternmost statue looks like a dragonborn man reading from a scroll.": "楼梯让你进入一个巨大的钻石形房间，每边都有60英尺高。四根柱子将80英尺高的天花板高高举起。在每面墙的中心，有四条通道从房间中分离出来，每条通道都朝向一个红心方向。在钻石的三个角落里，没有楼梯的地方，站着四座高大的雕像，你刚从楼梯上下来。最南边的雕像被雕刻成一条红龙，呲牙咧嘴的样子。最西边的雕像看起来像一个美丽的女人，穿着长长的、流动的长袍，她的手臂在胸前交叉。而最东边的雕像看起来像一个龙裔男子在阅读卷轴。",
	"The three statues depict Defroksanz (south), Dambudzo (west), and The Master (east).": "这三座雕像分别描绘了德夫罗桑兹（南）、丹布佐（西）和大师（东）。",
	"A single {@creature black pudding} hides behind the statue of the man reading from the open scroll When a character comes within 5 feet of the statue, the ooze attacks.": "一个{@creature black pudding}的人躲在雕像后面读着打开的卷轴，当一个角色进入雕像的5英尺范围内时，渗出物会攻击。",
	"If a character searches the statue of Dambudzo and succeeds ona DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, they discover a hidden compartment in the pedestal upon which she stands.  The compartment contains a key that opens the secret trapdoors in areas {@area 13|13 - Instructors Lounge|x} and {@area 14|14 - Summoning room|x}.": "如果一个角色搜索丹布佐的雕像，并在DC15智慧（感知）检查中成功，他们会在她所站的基座上发现一个隐藏的隔间。 这个隔间里有一把钥匙，可以打开{@area 13|13 - Instructors Lounge|x}和{@area 14|14 - Summoning room|x}区域的秘密陷阱门。",
	"This large square room is 40-feet on a side with two doors to the west and south. There are 14 beds in the room, each with a locker at its foot.": "这个大的正方形房间边长40英尺，有两个门通往西边和南边。房间里有14张床，每张床的脚下都有一个柜子。",
	"The moment the characters enter the room, they are subjected to the babbling of three {@creature gibbering mouther||gibbering mouthers}.
