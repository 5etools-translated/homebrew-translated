	"In eons past, the mind flayers enslaved entire races including the forerunners of the githyanki and githzerai. Centuries of captivity bred hatred, nurtured resolve, and finally instilled psionic powers into these slaves. With mental armaments of their own and a powerful leader to rally behind (the legendary Gith), the slaves instigated a cross-planar struggle that, in the end, threw down the mind flayer empire, bringing freedom to the surviving slaves.": "在过去的岁月里，心灵传播者奴役了整个种族，包括Githyanki和Githzerai的先驱。几个世纪的囚禁孕育了仇恨，培养了决心，并最终向这些奴隶灌输了幻觉能力。有了自己的精神武器和一个强大的领袖（传说中的吉斯），奴隶们发起了一场跨星球的斗争，最终推翻了心灵杀手帝国，为幸存的奴隶们带来了自由。",
	"Due to philosophical differences the gith split into two racially distinct groups. Both peoples' hatred of the mind flayers knows no bounds, though, and they break off hostilities with one another to slay mind flayers if the opportunity presents itself.": "由于哲学上的分歧，吉斯人分裂成两个种族上的不同群体。不过，这两个民族对噬心者的憎恨是无止境的，如果有机会的话，他们会彼此中断敌对行动，杀死噬心者。",
	"A group of mind flayers have been working feverishly to resolve the problem the gith collectively present and have finally constructed a powerful psionic artifact that when powered up, will allow them to resume control over the race of gith. It is designed to neutralize them psionically. So much so, that once lost, they will never regain their formidable abilities.": "一群心灵传播者一直在疯狂地工作，以解决吉斯人集体出现的问题，并最终建造了一个强大的幻象神器，当它启动时，将允许他们恢复对吉斯人种族的控制。它被设计成可以从灵性上中和他们。如此一来，一旦失去，他们将永远无法恢复其强大的能力。",
	"The artifact is a flawless diamond, the size of a gith's head, and inscribed with runes upon every facet. Referred to by the illithid as the {@i Gith Capacitor},to power it up, they must expose it to the energy and insanity of the Far Realm. However, gates to the Far Realm are virtually all but unknown... until recently.": "这件神器是一颗无暇的钻石，有巨石的头那么大，每个面都刻有符文。伊利特人称它为{@i Gith Capacitor}，为了给它提供能量，他们必须把它暴露在远界的能量和疯狂中。然而，通往远界的大门几乎无人知晓...直到最近。",
	"The mind flayers have recently discovered a gate to the Far Realm within the howling tunnels of Pandemonium, and they've gathered together to power the artifact up. Fortunately, the Sha'sal Khou discovered this plot, and in adopting the tradition of their githzerai constituents, brought together a powerful rrakkma comprised of both githyanki and githzerai to quell the illithid threat once again.": "最近，在潘德蒙的咆哮隧道中，思想絮乱者发现了一扇通往远界的大门，他们聚集在一起，为这个神器提供能量。幸运的是，Sha'sal Khou发现了这个阴谋，并采用了他们的githzerai成员的传统，召集了一个由githyanki和githzerai组成的强大的rrakkma，再次平息了illithid的威胁。",
	"The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate their armor and weapons—the legendary silver swords with which they cut through their foes. Since winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become ruthless conquerors under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith.": "Githyanki从他们的星际飞船的甲板上和红龙的背上掠夺了无数的世界。羽毛、珠子、宝石和贵重金属装饰着他们的盔甲和武器--传说中的银剑，他们用银剑斩断敌人的身体。自从从思想絮乱者手中赢得自由后，吉蒂扬基人在他们可怕的虱子女王弗拉基斯的统治下，成为无情的征服者。",
	"Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Lean and muscular, they wear unadorned clothing free of ornamentation, keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs on their warlike githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a strict monastic lifestyle, dwelling on islands of order in the vast sea of chaos that is the plane of Limbo.": "专注的哲学家和严格的禁欲主义者，吉斯泽拉人追求严格的秩序生活。他们身材瘦削，肌肉发达，穿着没有任何装饰的衣服，保持自己的意见，几乎不信任同类之外的生物。在背弃了他们好战的吉提安基族人后，吉斯泽拉人保持着严格的僧侣生活方式，居住在林波平面这个巨大的混乱之海中的秩序之岛。",
	"The Sha'sal Khou are githyanki and githzerai radicals working toward the reunification of their respective peoples. They labor to create a unified nation of gith. Members of the Sha'sal Khou work secretly within their respective societies, subtly discouraging attacks on the other gith race while carefully recruiting like-minded individuals. They maintain a secret redoubt on the Sword Coast as well.": "沙沙尔-库是吉提亚基和吉提泽拉的激进分子，致力于实现各自民族的统一。他们努力创造一个统一的吉斯国家。沙尔-库的成员在他们各自的社会中秘密工作，巧妙地阻止对其他吉斯族的攻击，同时谨慎地招募志同道合的人。他们在剑海岸也有一个秘密的堡垒。",
	"The characters participating in this adventure are members of this fortification, and work with the other races of the Realms to further their goals. While in the pursuit of their objectives or even simply as training to pursue them, they find themselves participating in all sorts of expeditions and adventures alongside the factions.": "参加这次冒险的人物是这个防御工事的成员，他们与王国的其他种族合作以推进他们的目标。在追求他们的目标时，甚至只是作为追求目标的训练，他们发现自己与各派别一起参加了各种探险和冒险。",
	"As a general note, the Sha'sal Khou aren't a faction in the same sense as the Harpers or Zhentarim. They are a background element only and meant to be a unifying element for gith characters in this campaign.": "一般来说，Sha'sal Khou并不是一个与Harpers或Zhentarim相同意义上的派系。他们只是一个背景元素，旨在成为本活动中吉斯人角色的一个统一元素。",
	"The characters begin the adventure standing about one-hundred feet from a gate to Pandemonium.": "冒险开始时，角色们站在离潘德蒙的大门约一百英尺的地方。",
	"They're underground, two days travel and far beneath the Sha'sal Khou redoubt on the Sword Coast.": "他们在地下，两天的路程，远在剑海岸的Sha'sal Khou红堡之下。",
	"Brought together as a rrakkma by Belthomias, lieutenant to Zetch'r'r, leader of the Sha'sal Khou, the characters know the following.": "作为Rrakkma的一员，他们被Sha'sal Khou领导人Zetch'r'r的副官Belthomias带到一起，知道以下情况。",
	"Among the Sha'sal Khou a rrakkma is a gith hunting party brought together for the explicit purpose of hunting mind flayers.": "在Sha'sal Khou中，Rrakkma是一个吉斯人狩猎队，其明确的目的是猎杀思想传播者。",
	"A group of mind flayers have created a weapon of immense power called the {@i Gith Capacitor}. They intend to use this artifact to wipe psionics from the collective minds of the gith peoples and enslave them once more.": "一群精神分裂者创造了一种具有巨大威力的武器，叫做{@i Gith Capacitor}。他们打算用这件神器将幻术从吉斯族人的集体头脑中抹去，并再次奴役他们。",
	"To activate the {@i Gith Capacitor}, the mind flayers must expose it to the unfathomable energies of the Far Realm, a place beyond space and time.": "为了激活{@i Gith Capacitor}，掠夺者必须把它暴露在深不可测的远界能量中，一个超越空间和时间的地方。",
	"The mind flayers have traveled through a nearby portal to the plane of Pandemonium, where they are rumored to have located a direct path to the Far Realm.": "噬心者已经通过附近的一个传送门来到了潘德蒙位面，据传他们在那里找到了一条通往远界的直接路径。",
	"Belthomias gave the adventurers a tuning fork, tuned to the plane of Pandemonium to lead them directly to the portal.": "贝尔索米亚斯给了冒险者一个音叉，调到了潘德蒙的平面上，可以直接把他们引到入口处。",
	"The {@i Gith Capacitor} appears to be a diamond the size of a gith head, with runes engraved into every facet.": "这个{@i Gith Capacitor}似乎是一颗钻石，有一个吉斯人的头那么大，每个切面都刻有符文。",
	"Belthomias ambushed an ulitharid in an attempt to take possession of the {@i Gith Capacitor}, and barely escaped with his life.": "贝尔托米亚斯伏击了一个试图占有{@i Gith Capacitor}的乌利塔里德，并勉强逃过一劫。",
	"Belthomias did manage to psionically conjoin with the artifact and transferred that connection to a reliquary containing a shard of bone from Zerthimon, the original githzerai anarch.": "贝尔托米亚斯确实设法与神器产生了幻觉，并将这种联系转移到一个装有泽尔西蒙（Zerthimon）的骨头碎片的遗物箱中，泽尔西蒙是最初的吉塞拉人。",
	"As the {@i Gith Capacitor} grows in power, the light from the reliquary grows as well, serving as a rough indicator of how much time the rrakkma has before the artifact is fully charged.": "随着{@i Gith Capacitor}能量的增长，灵位的光亮也在增长，作为一个粗略的指标，显示在神器完全充电之前，Rrakkma还有多少时间。",
	"Additional information regarding the reliquary can be found in {@adventure Appendix 3. DM Tips|AL-RKM|4|Appendix 3. Dungeon Master Tips}.": "有关灵位的其他信息可以在（%0%）中找到。",
	"The initial purpose here is to set the scene and put the adventurers directly into the action. There is no point to creating an extra decision point at the beginning of the adventure when we know they're going.": "这里最初的目的是为了设置场景，让冒险者直接进入行动。当我们知道他们要去的时候，在冒险的开始创造一个额外的决定点是没有意义的。",
	"After the tuning fork was struck, the rrakkma followed it for a day along many winding stone tunnels deep into the Underdark. After a long rest, they resumed their journey until they arrived here, at the opening to a massive cavern housing a great fungal forest.": "音叉被敲响后，Rrakkma沿着许多蜿蜒的石头隧道深入地下世界，走了一天。经过长时间的休息，他们继续旅行，直到他们到达这里，在一个巨大的洞穴的开口处，里面有一个巨大的真菌森林。",
	"The cavern is roughly circular and a half-mile in diameter, with a dozen tunnels (including the one used by the adventurers) leading out of it. About 100 feet ahead, amidst a tall stand of zurkhwood mushrooms, is an elaborate, glowing portal, 50-foot tall, and half as wide at its base.": "这个洞穴大致是圆形的，直径有半英里，有十几条隧道（包括冒险家们使用的那条）从里面出来。前方约100英尺处，在一片高大的紫檀木蘑菇中，有一个精致的发光门户，高50英尺，底部有一半的宽度。",
	"Some of the fungus in the forest is phosphorescent in nature, casting a dim light throughout.": "森林中的一些真菌具有磷光性质，在整个森林中投下昏暗的光线。",
	"A {@creature mind flayer} and its {@creature duergar warlord|MTF} thrall guard the gate from intrusion with the assistance of four {@creature duergar stone guard|MTF} that serve the warlord.": "一个{@creature mind flayer}和它的{@creature duergar warlord|MTF}傀儡在四个为军阀服务的{@creature duergar stone guard|MTF}的协助下守卫着大门不被入侵。",
	"The mind flayer hides nearby, having full cover from where the rrakkma enters the cavern, while the duergar stand in front of the gate; {@condition invisible}.": "读心者躲在附近，从拉克马进入洞穴的地方有充分的掩护，而杜尔加站在门前；（%0%）。",
	"The mind flayer fights to the death to prevent the adventurers' passage through the gate, as its thrall, the duergar warlord. The duergar stone guard are only following the orders of their warlord however, and don't like mind flayers any more than the adventurers do. Nor are they aware that a mind flayer is nearby. If they discover the mind flayer, they're likely to turn on their warlord, knowing full well the madness that can take those under an illithid's influence.": "噬心者拼死阻止冒险者通过大门，因为它的傀儡--杜尔加战神。然而，杜尔加人的石头守卫只是听从他们战神的命令，他们比冒险者更不喜欢噬心者。他们也不知道附近有一个读心者。如果他们发现了读心者，他们很可能会背叛他们的战神，因为他们清楚地知道，在幻术师的影响下，人们会变得很疯狂。",
	"The mind flayer knows this however and does what it can to remain unseen up to the point where all four stone guards have fallen.": "然而，思想絮乱者知道这一点，并尽其所能保持不被发现，直到四个石头守卫全部倒下。",
	"If the adventurers find a way to interrogate either the mind flayer or the warlord, they can confirm that a group of mind flayers passed through the portal.": "如果冒险家们找到了审问那名心灵传播者或军阀的方法，他们就可以确认有一群心灵传播者通过了传送门。",
	"The stone guards know only that they've been commanded by the warlord to keep anyone from using it.": "石头守卫们只知道他们被军阀命令不让任何人使用它。",
	"The mind flayer also knows that the illithid who passed the portal were in possession of a massive rune-carved diamond.": "弑心者还知道，通过传送门的伊里特人拥有一颗巨大的符文雕刻的钻石。",
	"If the adventurers bypass the warlord and mind flayer without killing them, the creatures pursue them through the portal, resulting in an extra challenging fight involving the elder oblex in Area 3 on the other side.": "如果冒险家们绕过军阀和噬心者而没有杀死他们，这些生物就会通过传送门追赶他们，从而导致另一边的第3区有一场涉及长老奥布拉克斯的额外挑战性战斗。",
	"While most of the mushrooms in the forest are inedible, it is possible to harvest spores from the zurkhwood as food, and several stands of barrelstalks may be tapped for water. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check is required to recognize either.": "虽然森林里的大多数蘑菇都不能食用，但可以从祖尔卡木中收获孢子作为食物，也可以从几座桶状树上取水。要认识这两种东西，需要成功地进行DC15智慧（生存）检查。",
	"It's possible to turn this into a perfectly amicable encounter if the adventurers find a way to destroy or reveal the mind flayer, or if they free the warlord from its influence.": "如果冒险家们找到了摧毁或揭开心灵杀手的方法，或者把军阀从它的影响中解救出来，就有可能把这变成一场完全友好的遭遇战。",
	"Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then, only to a maximum distance of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on hearing.": "潘德蒙是一个疯狂的平面，是一个巨大的岩石群，上面布满了由呼啸的风雕刻的隧道。这里寒冷、嘈杂、黑暗，没有自然光。风会迅速熄灭非魔法性的明火，如火把和营火。它还使对话只能通过大喊大叫来实现，即使如此，也只能达到10英尺的距离。生物在任何依赖听觉的能力检查中都处于劣势。",
	"Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment. The information above is available to the adventurers if they succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Two or more of them may confer to grant one of them Advantage on this check.": "这个星球上的大多数居民都是被放逐到这个星球上的生物，他们中的许多人都被无休止的风逼疯了，或者被迫躲在风势减弱的地方，直到听起来像遥远的折磨人的哭声。如果冒险者成功通过DC20智力({@skill Arcana})检查，就可以获得上述信息。两个或更多的人可以商议，赋予其中一个人在这个检查中的优势。",
	"A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds*. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of {@condition exhaustion}. A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described here. Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's exhaustion level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.": "在呼啸的风中每过一小时，来访者必须做一个DC10的智慧救赎动作。拯救失败时，该生物会获得一级的（%0%）。在这个平面上达到六级疲惫的生物并不会死亡。相反，该生物会获得一种随机形式的无限期疯狂，如这里所述。完成长时间的休息并不会降低生物的疲惫等级，除非该生物能够以某种方式逃离疯狂的风。",

	"\"I keep whatever I find.\"": "\"我发现什么就保留什么\"。",
	"I try to become more like someone else I know–adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.": "我试图变得更像我认识的其他人--采用他或她的衣着风格、举止和名字。",
	"\"I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.": "\"我必须歪曲事实，夸大其词，或者直接撒谎，才能让别人觉得有趣。",
	"\"Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I'll ignore everything else to pursue it.\"": "\"实现我的目标是我唯一感兴趣的事情，为了追求这个目标，我可以不顾其他一切。\"",

	"\"I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go.\"": "\"我相信强大的敌人正在追杀我，我所到之处都有他们的代理人。\"",
	"\"There's only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.": "\"只有一个人我可以信任。而且只有我可以看到这位特殊的朋友。",
	"\"I can't take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.\"": "\"我不能认真对待任何事情。情况越严重，我就越觉得好笑\"。",
	"\"I've discovered that I really like killing people.\"": "\"我发现，我真的很喜欢杀人。\"",
	"While this is left to the Dungeon Master's discretion, a good guidepost is to have the characters make a saving throw after reasonably thorough exploration or encounters in every two to three rooms, and definitely at the end of each short rest taken. Of course a long rest can be very trying on the characters that end up attempting eight saving throws over that time.": "虽然这要由地下城管理员来决定，但一个好的指导原则是让角色在每两到三个房间进行合理的探索或遭遇后进行一次蓄力，而且一定要在每次短暂休息结束后进行。当然，长时间的休息对那些在这段时间内尝试八次蓄力的角色来说是非常困难的。",
	"There are no lights here, magical or otherwise. Due to the porous nature of the stone here, a stiff and ever-changing wind blows throughout the temple preventing any nonmagical open flames from being lit.": "这里没有灯光，无论是魔法还是其他。由于这里的石头具有多孔性，僵硬而不断变化的风吹遍了整个寺庙，使任何非魔法的明火无法点燃。",
	"Roughly thirty-five feet by thirty-five feet, this chamber, like all of those throughout the temple, appears to have been rough-cut from the porous rock that makes up this place. The stone walls allow the wind free reign here in the temple, and have littered the floor with sand, pebbles, and stones that kick up as the adventurers walk across them.": "这个密室大约有35英尺×35英尺，就像整个神庙中的所有密室一样，似乎是由构成这里的多孔岩石粗略切割而成。石墙允许风在寺庙中自由支配，并且在地板上堆满了沙子、卵石和石头，当冒险者走过这些石头时，它们会被踢起来。",
	"There was a high-level {@spell glyph of warding} in this chamber. However, when the mind flayers attempted to pass from this chamber, they triggered the trap which summoned an invisible stalker. They managed to slay the creature, but not before it took one of them down.": "在这个房间里有一个高级的（%0%）。然而，当心灵传播者试图从这个房间通过时，他们触发了陷阱，召唤出了一个无形的跟踪者。他们成功地杀死了这个生物，但在它把他们中的一个人放倒之前。",
	"On the floor of this chamber is a dead mind flayer. Its insides are filled with sand and pebbles. {@spell Detect magic} reveals residual magic using both abjuration and conjuration schools. If the characters possess this knowledge, a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Investigation}) check allows them to ascertain that either \"the wind\" rose up and killed the illithid, or an air elemental or something similar was responsible.": "在这个密室的地板上，有一个死掉的思想者。它的内部充满了沙子和卵石。{@spell Detect magic}揭示了使用咒语和魔法学校的残余魔法。如果人物拥有这些知识，成功通过DC20智力（（%1%）或（%2%））检查，可以确定要么是 \"风 \"起来杀死了illithid，要么是空气元素或类似的东西在作怪。",
	"Fifty feet on a side, the walls of this rough-cut room have been scoured clean and smell strongly of chlorine. Stone benches have been carved directly from the stone by the chaos priests that once lived here, though constant exposure to the winds of the plane have left them structurally brittle.": "这间粗制滥造的房间边长50英尺，墙壁被洗得干干净净，有强烈的氯气味。石椅是曾经住在这里的混沌祭司直接从石头上雕刻出来的，尽管经常暴露在飞机的风中，使它们的结构变得很脆。",
	"Several aged and rotted garments lay scattered across the floor, discarded by chaos clergy in favor of more ecclesiastical clothing before moving further into the temple complex. The walls here were washed with a chlorine solution daily when the temple was in use, thus giving the entire chamber its unusual odor.": "几件陈旧腐烂的衣服散落在地板上，是混乱的神职人员在进一步进入神庙建筑群之前丢弃的，以换取更多的教会服装。当神庙在使用时，这里的墙壁每天都会用氯气溶液清洗，从而使整个房间有了不寻常的气味。",
	"There is nothing else of apparent interest here, though if the adventurers make a successful DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, they find a mithral brooch adorned with gold tracery, embedded in the wall in one corner of the room. This was overlooked by the mind flayers.": "这里没有其他明显值得关注的东西，不过如果冒险者成功地进行了DC25智力({@skill Investigation})检查，他们会发现在房间一角的墙壁上嵌有一枚装饰有金色纹路的米塔尔胸针。这是被思想絮乱者忽略了的。",
	"The characters may find the following treasure.": "人物可以找到以下宝物。",
	"A {@item brooch of shielding}; a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check reveals that it was crafted by a celestial artisan.": "一个{@item brooch of shielding}；成功的DC20智力({@skill Arcana})检查显示它是由一个天体工匠制作的。",
	"This elongated chamber (fifty-five feet by eighty-five feet) has a twenty-foot high ceiling. The room may have once served as a guard station as hooks and racks for weapons are arrayed throughout the room. The few weapons that remain resemble the glaive, though the blades are pitted, scored, and brittle. The wood that makes up their hafts is all but rotted away. About a dozen of the aged polearms hang from the walls haphazardly about the room.": "这个长长的房间（五十五英尺乘八十五英尺）有一个二十英尺高的天花板。这个房间可能曾经是一个守卫站，因为整个房间里都摆放着武器的挂钩和架子。留存下来的少数武器类似于青铜器，尽管刀片上有凹痕、刻痕，而且很脆。组成武器的木头已经全部腐烂了。房间里大约有一打陈旧的杆状武器胡乱地挂在墙上。",
	"There is an {@creature elder oblex|MTF} in this chamber, though the bulk of the creature resides as a strange pool of red goo on the far side of the chamber from where the adventures must enter.": "在这个房间里有一个{@creature elder oblex|MTF}，虽然这个生物的大部分是以奇怪的红色粘液池的形式存在于冒险者必须进入的房间的远侧。",
	"As the gith approach the chamber, the oblex sends a sulfurous impersonation of a human woman dressed in plate mail and bearing a longsword, to the entrance to beckon the adventurers forward into the chamber.": "当吉斯人走近密室时，奥布拉克斯派出一个身穿板甲、手持长剑的人类女子的硫磺假象，来到入口处，召唤冒险家们前进，进入密室。",
	"As the adventurers approach the chamber, the human woman backs away from them as it continues to beckon them into the room. Being quite intelligent, the oblex can absolutely hold a conversation with the gith using this form.": "当冒险者们走近密室时，这个人类女人从他们身边退开，因为它继续召唤他们进入房间。由于相当聪明，奥布拉克斯绝对可以用这种形式与吉斯人进行对话。",
	"The elder oblex is a creation of the mind flayers and brought here to guard the way in. Its primary goal is to keep the adventurers from proceeding any further into the temple.": "长老奥布拉克斯是心灵传播者的杰作，被带到这里是为了守住入口。它的主要目标是阻止冒险者进一步进入神庙。",
	"As the oblex is incredibly intelligent, it completely understands and supports the mind flayers' objectives in their mission to subjugate the gith.": "由于奥布拉克斯具有难以置信的智慧，它完全理解并支持掠夺者在征服吉斯人的任务中的目标。",
	"If the duergar from the other side of the portal are pursuing the adventurers, the elder oblex uses Sulfurous Impersonation to try and lure them in quickly with promises of aid. Since the characters won't be able to hear the creature due to the winds, its communication consists of gestures only.": "如果传送门另一边的杜尔加人在追捕冒险者，长老奥布拉克斯就会使用 \"硫化物冒充术\"，试图用援助的承诺来引诱他们迅速进入。由于风的缘故，人物无法听到怪物的声音，它的交流只包括手势。",
	"The first thing the adventurers notice about the chamber this creature inhabits is that it smells strongly of sulphur. Also, the floor of this chamber is strangely clear of sand and debris.": "冒险家们注意到这个生物所居住的密室的第一件事是，它有强烈的硫磺味。而且，这个密室的地板上很奇怪地没有沙子和碎屑。",
	"If the gith wish to speak with the elder oblex, it is happy to waste their time with idle conversation. It tells them all manner of seemingly useful things that aren't true.": "如果吉斯人希望与长老奥布拉克斯交谈，它很乐意用闲聊来浪费他们的时间。它告诉他们各种看似有用的东西，但其实并不真实。",
	"Directly conjoined to the hallway, this chamber is twenty-five feet wide by forty-feet long. Sand mixed with crumbly pumice dances in the wind upon the floor here.": "这个房间与走廊直接相连，宽二十五英尺，长四十英尺。混合着碎石的沙子在这里的地板上随风舞动。",
	"A large vat of bubbling wax that is kept constantly hot by a magic flame beneath it, is on the far side of the chamber from the hallway. The vat is constructed of porcelain and inlaid with silver tracery around the edges.": "在密室与走廊之间的远处，有一个大桶，里面装着冒泡的蜡，通过下面的魔法火焰持续保持高温。大桶是由瓷器制成的，边缘镶嵌着银色的描边。",
	"Long strips of ragged and aged cloth hang from a pair of steel bars over the vat, where they are tied on to keep them from blowing away in the wind.": "长长的破旧布条挂在大桶上方的一对钢筋上，它们被绑在那里，以防止被风吹走。",

	"This was a purification chamber. Priests would strip naked and use the wax and cloth strips to remove all hair from their bodies before scrubbing themselves vigorously (sometimes to the point of bleeding) with the pumice stones. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check confirms that the 'dry brown flecks' are blood.": "这是一个净化室。祭司们会脱光衣服，用蜡和布条去除身上所有的毛发，然后用浮石用力擦洗自己（有时会流血）。成功通过DC15智慧({@skill Medicine})检查，可以确认 \"干燥的棕色斑点 \"是血。",

Kalak, who is proficient with alchemy supplies, can readily tell the difference given 10 minutes and use of his supplies (no check required).": "酸和圣水是没有标签的，在未经训练的人看来是一样的。卡拉克精通炼金术用品，只要给他10分钟并使用他的用品，他就能轻易地分辨出其中的差别（不需要检查）。",
	"The high priest used to hang from the bar by leather straps. There he'd sleep as the winds of Pandemonium raged throughout his chamber. He was quite insane, as were all the clergy of this temple, before it collapsed into decay and ruin.": "大祭司曾经用皮绳吊在栏杆上。他在那里睡觉，因为潘德蒙的风在他的房间里肆虐。他和这座寺庙的所有神职人员一样，在它坍塌成腐朽和废墟之前，都是相当疯狂的。",
	"The characters find the following treasure.": "角色们找到了以下宝藏。",
	"Silver aspergillum (500 gp)": "银色天门冬 (500 gp)",
	"A wrought iron spiral staircase, rusted and crumbling from disrepair and neglect, leads up to the ceiling of this circular chamber, twenty-five feet in diameter.": "一个因年久失修而生锈、摇摇欲坠的锻铁螺旋楼梯，通向这个直径为25英尺的圆形房间的天花板。",
	"It appears that there may have once been a tower, or at the very least, another chamber above this room, but stone is all that remains where a doorway should be.": "似乎曾经有一座塔，或者至少在这个房间上面有另一个房间，但是在应该有门的地方只剩下石头。",
	"The ceiling of this chamber is solid stone and not porous like the walls and ceilings throughout the rest of the complex.": "这个房间的天花板是实心的石头，不像整个建筑群其他地方的墙壁和天花板那样是多孔的。",
	"This passage indeed leads to another chamber of approximately the same size as this one. The chamber above is completely sealed off from the winds of Pandemonium, though it has a small two-foot by two- foot window that has been fitted with an adamantine shutter. The shutter may be opened or closed from inside so that the high priest could look out upon Pandemonium and meditate.": "这条通道确实通向另一个和这个房间差不多大小的房间。上面的密室与潘德蒙的风完全隔绝，不过它有一个两英尺乘两英尺的小窗户，上面安装了一个金刚砂百叶窗。百叶窗可以从里面打开或关闭，这样大祭司就可以眺望潘德蒙，进行冥想。",
	"If the characters open the shutter, feel free to describe the most hellish, wind-blasted landscape you can. Closing and sealing the shutter requires either a Strength of 18 or a successful DC 15 Strength check.": "如果人物打开了百叶窗，请随意描述你能描述的最地狱般的、被风吹过的风景。关闭和封住百叶窗需要18的力量或成功的DC15力量检查。",
	"The high priest of the temple was the only one to come up here, and he entered the room using a stone shape spell. If the characters can enter the chamber, it makes an excellent place to rest or hide, whatever the case may be. While the staircase is in disrepair, it is sturdy enough for an individual gith to traverse at a time.": "神殿的大祭司是唯一一个上来的人，他使用石形法术进入房间。如果人物能够进入密室，那么无论情况如何，它都是一个绝佳的休息或藏身之地。虽然楼梯年久失修，但它的坚固程度足以让一个单独的吉斯人一次穿越。",
	"This chamber is thirty feet by fifty feet. A viscous fluid comprised of water mixed with grainy sand and earth, drips from the ceiling coating the floors and walls.": "这个房间有30英尺×50英尺。一种由水和颗粒状沙土混合而成的粘稠液体，从天花板上滴下，覆盖在地板和墙壁上。",
	"Though it is not marked on the map this room has a thick stone door (AC 17, hp 30), located at the far end of the hall just before entering the room itself. The door was accidentally shut when the star spawn manglers entered the chamber. It is locked and requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by someone proficient with thieves' tools to unlock it, or a successful DC 20 Strength check made by someone with a Strength score of 16 or greater, to break it down.": "虽然地图上没有标注，但这个房间有一扇厚厚的石门（AC 17, hp 30），位于大厅的远端，就在进入房间本身之前。这扇门在星星产卵者进入房间时被意外地关上了。它被锁住了，需要精通盗贼工具的人成功地进行DC20的灵巧检查来解锁，或者由力量值在16以上的人成功地进行DC20的力量检查来打破它。",
	"Opening the door to this chamber reveals a grisly sight. Three desiccated human corpses are strung up at even intervals on iron bars that cross the room in a grid, eight feet above the ground. The bodies hang lifelessly from leather straps that are tied down to the grid with elaborate knots.": "打开这个房间的门，就会看到一个可怕的景象。三具干枯的人的尸体被均匀地串在铁栏杆上，铁栏杆以网格的形式穿过房间，离地面8英尺高。这些尸体毫无生气地挂在皮绳上，皮绳用精致的绳结绑在网格上。",
	"The floors here are slick because of the water and walking on them is normally no trouble. However, once combat begins, anyone charging across the floor must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check or slip and fall prone. The viscous fluid coats their hands, imposing disadvantage on their next weapon attack roll. This fluid can be removed by using an action to scrape off the character's hands.": "这里的地板因为有水而很光滑，在上面行走通常没有问题。然而，一旦战斗开始，任何冲过地板的人都必须成功地进行DC 15灵巧({@skill Acrobatics})的检查，否则就会滑倒在地。粘稠的液体包裹着他们的双手，使他们在下一次武器攻击卷中处于不利地位。这种液体可以通过使用一个动作从人物的手上刮掉来清除。",
	"Three {@creature Star Spawn Mangler|MTF|star spawn manglers} were the first creatures to emerge from the portal to the Far Realm when the mind flayers opened it. These shadowy low-slung, creeping horrors each have six arms, and move quickly along the ground and walls.": "三人（%0%）是当心灵传播者打开通往远界的入口时，第一批出现的生物。这些阴暗的低矮的爬行恐怖物各有六只手臂，并沿着地面和墙壁快速移动。",
	"These creatures immediately fled the chamber with the illithids and started exploring the complex, until they became trapped here. Natural assassins, when the adventurers start fiddling with the door, they quickly find hiding places in the shadows and attempt to ambush the interlopers.": "这些生物立即和伊里特人一起逃离了密室，并开始探索这个建筑群，直到它们被困在这里。它们是天生的刺客，当冒险者开始摆弄这扇门时，它们很快就在阴影中找到了藏身之处，并试图伏击这些闯入者。",
	"These creatures were commanded by a star spawn seer to investigate the complex beyond the portal and make certain the ritual to charge the {@i Gith Capacitor}was not interrupted.": "这些生物是由一个星产预言家指挥的，去调查传送门外的建筑群，并确保为{@i Gith Capacitor}充电的仪式不被打断。",
	"The star spawn manglers take advantage of their shadowy surroundings to get the drop on the adventurers and continue to hide in the shadows throughout combat.": "星形产卵器的芒格利用其阴暗的环境对冒险者进行攻击，并在整个战斗中继续隐藏在阴暗处。",
	"The water is not drinkable and attempting to do so requires the unwise to succeed at a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer from the poisoned condition for the next 24 hours.": "水是不能喝的，试图这样做需要不明智的人在DC20宪法救赎中成功，否则在接下来的24小时内会受到中毒状态的影响。",
	"The star spawn manglers are certainly prone to taunting chatter during combat, and share a language in common with Ven'delen, the bard. If conversation transpires, it is certainly possible for the adventurers to learn that the illithid made a deal with a powerful star spawn seer in the Far Realm, and that they may want to get a move on, as the artifact has already begun charging.": "在战斗过程中，星际产卵者当然很容易嘲讽性地喋喋不休，并且与吟游诗人Ven'delen有共同的语言。如果交谈起来，冒险者当然有可能了解到，伊利希德人与远界的一个强大的星体预言家达成了交易，他们可能想赶快行动，因为神器已经开始充电了。",
	"This oddly circular chamber is forty feet in diameter one way and fifty feet in diameter the other.": "这个奇特的圆形密室一侧的直径为40英尺，另一侧的直径为50英尺。",
	"Statues, carved from a pure white marble, struck through with veins of a strange blood-red stone, stand at the perimeter of this chamber. A massive humanoid figure, also carved from the strange marble, stands the center of the chamber, its arms held high above its head to support the ceiling, forty feet above. A pair of fist-sized black crystals is fitted to the statue's eyes.": "雕像由纯白的大理石雕刻而成，上面有一种奇怪的血红色石头的纹路，矗立在这个房间的周边。一个巨大的人形雕像，也是由奇怪的大理石雕刻而成，矗立在密室的中心，它的双臂高举过头，支撑着40英尺高的天花板。雕像的眼睛上装有一对拳头大小的黑色晶体。",
	"The perimeter statues, six in all, appear to resemble naked humans in various states of torture. Feel free to make up descriptions of what this could be, or simply leave it to the imagination of your players. Either way, some degree of discretion and sensitivity to the age and experience of your audience should be liberally exercised.": "周边的雕像共有六座，看起来像处于各种折磨状态的裸体人类。你可以自由地描述这可能是什么，或者干脆把它留给你的玩家想象。无论哪种方式，都应该对观众的年龄和经验进行一定程度的谨慎和敏感。",
	"An {@creature eidolon|MTF} of the former high priest of this temple resides within the central {@creature sacred statue|MTF} of this chamber. The statue depicts some forgotten god dedicated to chaos and entropy, and as described below, holds up the ceiling overhead.": "这座寺庙的前大祭司的{@creature eidolon|MTF}雕像就住在这个房间的中央{@creature sacred statue|MTF}。这座雕像描绘了一些被遗忘的、致力于混沌和熵的神，正如下面所描述的，它撑起了头顶的天花板。",
	"Aware of the creature's existence, the mind flayers were able to make a pact with it and are bound to return with many sacrifices once they have completed their business in the Far Realm.": "意识到这种生物的存在，心灵传播者能够与它达成契约，一旦他们完成了在远界的业务，就一定会带着许多牺牲品回来。",
	"Interested in being worshipped once more, the insane eidolon protects this chamber from passage by creatures that aren't mind flayers or star spawn.": "对再次被崇拜很感兴趣，疯狂的伊多龙保护着这个密室，不让那些不是心灵传播者或星体产儿的生物通过。",
	"The eidolon is aware of the illithids' goal and is most ready and willing to do its part, as the result means blood on the altar to its dark and forgotten deity.": "伊德隆意识到了伊利特人的目标，并且最准备和最愿意做它的工作，因为结果意味着在祭坛上为它黑暗和被遗忘的神灵流血。",
	"When combat begins, the eidolon animates the sacred statue in the center of the chamber and attacks the adventurers. This allows the ceiling to slowly descend, clicking loudly.": "当战斗开始时，伊多龙将密室中央的神圣雕像变成动画，并攻击冒险者。这让天花板慢慢下降，发出响亮的咔嚓声。",
	"If the sacred statue is destroyed the two black crystals explode, releasing two {@creature Allip|MTF|allips}, as the eidolon is itself released from the statue.": "如果神圣的雕像被摧毁，两个黑色的水晶就会爆炸，释放出两个（%0%），因为Eidolon本身也会从雕像中释放出来。",
	"If the adventurers investigate they notice the tops of the statues are oddly flattened, as they were built to have a descending ceiling rest upon them.": "如果冒险家们进行调查，他们会注意到这些雕像的顶部被奇怪地压扁了，因为它们是为了让下降的天花板靠在它们上面而建造的。",
	"Once released from the statue, the eidolon begins a tirade of insults and threats. If the characters engage the creature in conversation while fighting the allips they can learn of the deal the creature made with the mind flayers, a subject that it gleefully engages in.": "一旦从雕像中被释放出来，伊多龙就开始大肆辱骂和威胁。如果角色们在与Allips战斗时与该生物进行对话，他们可以了解到该生物与噬心者的交易，它很高兴地参与了这个话题。",
	"As a note, after a minute, the ceiling rests upon the smaller statues, having descended 20 feet to do so.": "作为说明，一分钟后，天花板停在了较小的雕像上，为此下降了20英尺。",
	"Thirty feet by forty feet, there is an enclosure on one end of the chamber with a broken down, rusty gate.": "三十英尺乘四十英尺，在密室的一端有一个围墙，有一个破旧的、生锈的大门。",
	"The floor of this chamber is lined with small depressions at regular intervals. Water rapidly and continuously drips from the ceiling into the center of each depression. Manacled chains bound to the floor are mounted near many of the depressions.": "这个房间的地板上每隔一段距离就有一个小凹陷。水从天花板上迅速而持续地滴入每个凹陷的中心。许多凹陷处附近都安装了捆绑在地板上的手铐铁链。",
	"If any of the characters succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, they determine that victims were originally bound in chains in such a manner that the water dripping from the ceiling would strike them repeatedly and unavoidably in the head. At first, this may seem innocent, but left for days, or even just hours for some, this form of torture could break even the most steadfast soul or drive them completely insane.": "如果任何一个角色在DC10智慧（（%0%））检查中成功，他们就会确定受害者最初是被锁链绑住的，这样天花板上滴下的水就会反复地、不可避免地击中他们的头部。起初，这似乎是无辜的，但如果持续几天，甚至对某些人来说只是几个小时，这种形式的折磨甚至可以击垮最坚定的灵魂，或者使他们完全疯掉。",
	"A successful DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check turns up a rather sizeable black pearl ({@item pearl of power}) that seems to have found its way to the bottom of one of the depressions.": "通过DC25智力检查，发现一颗相当大的黑珍珠({@skill Investigation})，似乎已经找到了它在其中一个洼地的底部。",
	"Sixty-five feet at its furthest distance across, and about forty feet wide, this strangely shaped chamber is mostly rectangular.": "最远的距离是65英尺，宽约40英尺，这个形状奇怪的房间大部分是长方形。",
	"The walls of this odd chamber appear to have, at one time, been smoothed out and finished, allowing whoever inhabited this structure to record large amounts of information in some strange language upon the walls. However, time and the winds of Pandemonium have taken their toll upon this room as with the others, and the walls are now pockmarked and eroded to the point of incoherence.": "这个奇怪的房间的墙壁似乎曾经被磨平过，并且被加工过，使得居住在这里的人可以用一些奇怪的语言在墙壁上记录大量的信息。然而，时间和潘德蒙的风对这个房间造成了伤害，就像其他房间一样，现在墙壁上已经有了麻点，被侵蚀得不伦不类。",
	"Originally, the priests of this temple marked the tenants of their faith upon these walls, but the writing has been virtually scoured from the walls. Only vague markings in certain places here and there give testimony that the record even existed to begin with. Even a {@spell comprehend languages} spell turns up gibberish from what is left.": "最初，这座圣殿的祭司将他们信仰的房客标记在这些墙上，但这些文字几乎已从墙上被清除。只有这里和那里的某些地方有模糊的标记，证明这些记录开始时是存在的。即使是{@spell comprehend languages}的法术，也会从剩下的东西中发现胡言乱语。",
	"The adventurers can spend as much time as they like attempting to decipher the vague scrawl remaining, but it only wastes time. Feel free to make up bits of mad ramblings if you would like to encourage them further.": "冒险家们可以随心所欲地花时间试图破译剩下的模糊潦草的字迹，但这只会浪费时间。如果你想进一步鼓励他们，可以随意编造一些疯狂的呓语。",
	"Forty-five feet by one-hundred-ten feet, this is a massive cathedral.": "四十五英尺乘一百一十英尺，这是一个巨大的大教堂。",
	"Unlike the rest of this complex, there is a dim light throughout this chamber, originating from the active portal.": "与这个建筑群的其他部分不同，这个房间里有一种昏暗的光线，来自于活动的入口。",
	"This cathedral must have been something to behold at one point in time, but now the porous stone and winds of Pandemonium have brought it to its current decrepit state. At the far end of the cathedral is a shining adamantine archway alight with runes of power. The gate to the Far Realm is open. Due to some strange influence of the Far Realm, the winds of Pandemonium do not touch this place at the moment.": "这座大教堂在某一时期一定是值得一看的，但现在多孔的石头和潘德蒙的风把它带到了现在的破败状态。在大教堂的远端有一个闪亮的金刚拱门，上面有力量的符文。通往远界的大门已经打开。由于远界的一些奇怪的影响，潘德蒙的风目前还没有触及这个地方。",
	"Two {@creature Mind Flayer|MM|mind flayers} stand guard at the open portal to the Far Realm, though they are levitating twenty feet above the ground.": "两个{@creature Mind Flayer|MM|mind flayers}站在打开的通往远界的入口处守卫，虽然他们是悬浮在离地面20英尺的地方。",
	"These creatures will fight to the death to keep the gith from entering the Far Realm and attempting to spoil the plan.": "这些生物将为阻止吉斯人进入远界并试图破坏计划而战斗到死。",
	"The mind flayers know all the plans, but they're not really in a talking mood.": "掠心者知道所有的计划，但他们并没有真正的说话的心情。",

	"While the mind flayers aren't normally talkative, if one or both are charmed, they know of the creatures to be faced in the Far Realm and can inform the gith as to the resistances and immunities of star spawn seer and hulk.": "虽然心灵传播者通常不爱说话，但如果其中一个或两个都被迷住了，他们就会知道在远界要面对的生物，并能告知吉斯人关于星产预言家和绿巨人的抵抗力和免疫力。",
	"The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence.": "远界是在已知的多元宇宙之外。事实上，它可能是一个完全独立的宇宙，有自己的物理和魔法规律。当来自远界的游离能量泄漏到另一个位面时，物质就会被扭曲成异样的形状，违背了可理解的几何学和生物学原理。畸形人，如噬心者和持心者，要么来自这个位面，要么被其奇怪的影响所塑造。",
	"The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities there.": "居住在远界本身的实体太过陌生，正常人的心智无法毫无压力地接受。泰坦尼克号的生物在那里的虚无中游动，难以启齿的东西向那些敢于倾听的人低声诉说可怕的真相。对于凡人来说，对远方世界的了解是一场克服物质、空间和理智界限的思想斗争。一些术士通过与那里的实体结成契约来拥抱这种斗争。",
	"Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles, and horror.": "任何见过远界的人都会嘀咕眼睛、触角和恐怖。",
	"The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal's location - even its home world is long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by an alien magic that mutates the area around them.": "远界没有众所周知的传送门，或者至少没有仍然可行的传送门。古老的精灵曾经在一座名为火暴峰的山中打开了通往远界的巨大传送门，但他们的文明在血腥的恐怖中崩溃，传送门的位置--甚至它的母体世界也早已被遗忘。失落的传送门可能仍然存在，被一种外星魔法标记，使其周围的区域发生变异。",

If running this at an event, you might consider playing this over the course of two four- hour time slots, taking a break after the third combat encounter (most likely Area 7).": "由于这次冒险的战斗性很强，有可能需要六到八个小时的时间来进行。如果在活动中进行，你可以考虑在两个四小时的时间段内进行，在第三个战斗遭遇（很可能是第7区）后休息一下。",
	"If you're running this adventure outside of an event, it is of course up to the DM and players to decide how best to break up the action between game sessions.": "如果你在活动之外进行这个冒险，当然要由DM和玩家来决定如何在游戏环节之间最好地分解行动。",
	"Time is an important element of this adventure since, to succeed, the rrakkma must stop the {@i Gith Capacitor}from achieving a full charge.": "时间是这次冒险的一个重要因素，因为要想成功，雷克马必须阻止{@i Gith Capacitor}实现完全充电。",
	"At the same time, to show off as many new creatures from {@i Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes}, this adventure is extremely combat heavy as well. To keep the action going while remaining fair, this reliquary becomes the essential time keeping device for the adventurers.": "同时，为了尽可能多地展示{@i Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes}的新生物，这次冒险也是非常重的战斗。为了在保持公平的同时保持行动，这个灵位成为冒险者们必不可少的计时装置。",

	"If they take a long rest, it counts as three short rests. They could feasibly take a single long rest and a single short rest and still accomplish their mission. Any more rests however, and they fail.": "如果他们休息了很长时间，那就算作三次短暂的休息。他们可以可行地进行一次长休息和一次短休息，仍然可以完成他们的任务。然而再多的休息，他们就会失败。",
