	"There always have been stories of treasure on Thorn Island, the isle functioning as a natural breakwater for Phlan's harbor. The details differ with the teller of the tale.

Now most believe it has been found long ago or that it is just a myth; one of many that surrounds Phlan.": "荆棘岛上一直有关于宝藏的故事，该岛是弗兰港的一个天然防波堤。故事的细节因讲述者的不同而不同。许多人都在寻找传说中的索科尔堡的财富，但从来没有人声称拥有它，或者至少承认这样做。现在大多数人相信它早就被发现了，或者它只是一个神话；是围绕着弗兰的众多神话之一。",
	"In the decades that the keep was an abandoned ruin, there certainly has been ample of time for adventurers to scour the island. When House Sokol assumed control of the island, they never professed having found any treasure when they restored, and later extended, the keep. And they never looked very kindly on treasure seekers intruding upon their property and stead-fastedly blocked any thorough search of the keep in the century that they have been its custodian. Having been forced to mostly leave the island recently due to the troubles in the city, there would be little the House could do about any uninvited guests.": "在城堡成为废弃废墟的几十年里，冒险家们当然有足够的时间在岛上进行搜寻。当索科尔家族控制该岛时，他们从未声称在修复和后来扩建城堡时发现了任何宝藏。他们对闯入他们的财产的寻宝者从来没有好脸色，而且在他们担任保管人的一个世纪里，坚定不移地阻止了对该城堡的任何彻底搜查。最近，由于城市中的麻烦，他们被迫离开了这个岛，对于任何不请自来的客人，议院都无能为力。",
	"Still, Sokol Keep's lighthouse is a reliable source of income for the house and important to the city's maritime trade and defense. So the family left a token few retainers to maintain the fortress and ensure that the beacon was operational. Leading this small group was the young Igan Sokol, a junior member of the family. In addition, the Black Fist has a small squad of soldiers at the Keep to ostensibly help with defense.": "尽管如此，索科尔堡的灯塔仍是该家族可靠的收入来源，对该市的海上贸易和防御也很重要。因此，该家族象征性地留下了几名家臣来维护堡垒，确保灯塔的运行。领导这个小团体的是年轻的伊甘-索科尔，他是家族的初级成员。此外，黑拳组织在堡垒有一小队士兵，表面上是帮助防御。",
	"Well aware that his job was a kind of banishment, Igan thought that finding the fabled treasure would bring him back into good graces with his demanding parents. An opportunistic Black Fist soldier, Guard Sergeant Grim Thornbuck, befriended him and provided the young quartermaster with motivation to continue his search.": "意识到他的工作是一种放逐，伊甘认为找到传说中的宝藏会使他重新得到他苛刻的父母的好感。一个投机取巧的黑拳士兵，卫队中士格里姆-索恩巴克（Grim Thornbuck），与他结为好友，为这个年轻的军需官提供了继续寻找的动力。",
	"Unlike any previous treasure hunters, Igan had one huge advantage. Igan had been raised at the Keep, and at a young age he had found a well-hidden shrine of Tyr-long since forgotten. He restored it and maintained it ever since. Unbeknownst to others, the shrine was haunted by the spirit of a female cleric of Tyr, named Harae. The spirit knew of the treasure below the keep, and wanted to reward the young man for his dedication to the shrine. Hardly more than the sheerest presence, she was unable to truly interact with the world beyond moving small items around. Nevertheless, moving the right books and opening them to the correct pages was all that it took.": "与以往的寻宝者不同，伊甘有一个巨大的优势。伊甘是在堡垒长大的，在年轻的时候，他发现了一个隐藏得很好的泰尔龙的神龛，后来被遗忘了。他修复了它，并从那时起一直维护它。别人不知道的是，这座神殿被一个名叫Harae的泰尔女牧师的灵魂所困扰。灵魂知道守卫下面的宝藏，并想奖励这个年轻人对神殿的奉献。她只是一个最普通的存在，除了移动小物品外，她无法真正与这个世界互动。然而，移动正确的书籍并将它们打开到正确的页面就可以了。",
	"With the help of the spirit, Grim, and the other Black Fist guards, Igan found the hidden caverns beneath the keep and the expected treasure within. Upon seeing it, Igan thought the treasure to be evil, and wanted it destroyed. But greed overcame Grim and the other soldiers. Grim murdered Igan and had hoped to set sail in the night, but the murder awoke the long dormant guardians of the temple, trapping Grim and his co-conspirators in the dungeon below. In the spirit's anger and sadness, Harae disabled the lighthouse, hoping that she would catch the attention of adventurers who would come and recover Igan's body, arrest the murderers, and cleanse the island of undead for good.": "在精神、格力姆和其他黑拳卫士的帮助下，伊甘发现了守卫下的隐藏洞穴和里面预期的宝藏。看到它时，伊甘认为宝藏是邪恶的，并希望将其销毁。但贪婪战胜了格里姆和其他士兵。格里姆谋杀了伊根，并希望在夜里起航，但这次谋杀唤醒了沉睡已久的神庙守护者，将格里姆和他的同谋者困在下面的地牢里。在精神的愤怒和悲伤中，Harae弄坏了灯塔，希望她能引起冒险者的注意，他们会来找回伊甘的尸体，逮捕凶手，并永远清除岛上的亡灵。",
	"Lured by rumors of treasure and locals beseeching the characters to restore the beacon, the characters now have to explore the island to find out what happened and bring the murders to justice.": "在宝藏传言和当地人恳求人物恢复灯塔的诱惑下，人物现在必须探索这个岛屿，找出发生的事情，将谋杀案绳之以法。",
	"The adventure starts with the characters visiting the Laughing Goblin, one of the more famous taverns at the docks. The news about the extinguished beacon atop Sokol Keep is the topic de jour. Before the characters can investigate further, a group of dockworkers confronts two mercenaries; personal friends of some of the Black Fist guards assigned to the Keep. The confrontation is unlikely to go well and ends up in a tavern brawl if the characters don't intervene. After the fight, the characters learn a bit more about events and are asked by the locals to investigate, since the authorities care more about politics than solving the issue.": "冒险开始时，角色们访问了码头上比较有名的酒馆之一--\"笑妖精\"。关于索科尔堡顶上熄灭的灯塔的消息是今天的主题。在人物进一步调查之前，一群码头工人与两名雇佣兵发生了冲突；这两名雇佣兵是被派往堡垒的一些黑拳卫士的私人朋友。这场对峙不太可能顺利，如果人物不干预的话，最终会演变成一场酒馆斗殴。战斗结束后，人物对事件有了更多的了解，并被当地人要求进行调查，因为当局更关心的是政治而不是解决这个问题。",
	"At Sokol Keep the characters can interact with the servants, potentially a spirit and search through the possessions of Igan and the Black Fist guards to get an idea of what happened. The information leads them to the West Tower and the now obvious closed entrance of an until-recently hidden area below the keep. Assuming the characters have found the right clues, they can easily open it and go down. Otherwise it requires more work.": "在索科尔堡，角色们可以与仆人们互动，可能还有一个灵魂，并通过伊甘和黑拳卫士的物品来了解发生了什么。这些信息将他们引向西塔和现在明显封闭的入口，这个入口一直隐藏在城堡下面。假设这些人物找到了正确的线索，他们可以很容易地打开它并下去。否则就需要更多的工作。",
	"The hidden area is a long-forgotten, subterranean temple dedicated to some unknown entity that predates the existence of the Keep. It is wet and muddy. In the central area of worship the characters find Igan's body as well as a group of skeletal guardians that seem to have animated as a result of the guards's defilement of the temple. Within the hidden temple, they also find the Black Fist soldiers who are desperate to leave. Depending on how the characters react, the Black Fist might face them in combat or peacefully surrender.": "这个隐蔽的区域是一个被遗忘已久的地下寺庙，供奉着一些在堡垒存在之前的未知实体。这里潮湿而泥泞。在崇拜的中心区域，角色们发现了伊甘的尸体，以及一群骷髅守护者，他们似乎因为守卫者对神庙的玷污而活了过来。在隐藏的寺庙里，他们还发现了急于离开的黑拳士兵。根据人物的反应，黑拳组织可能会在战斗中面对他们，也可能会和平地投降。",
	"With the capture of the Black Fist and the discovery of Igan's body, the adventure ends. All the characters have to do now is think about what to tell the world.": "随着黑拳的捕获和伊甘尸体的发现，冒险结束。人物现在要做的就是思考如何向世界交代。",
	"The adventure begins as the characters are at the Laughing Goblin, a somewhat famous tavern at the docks of Phlan. It is a place that caters mostly to the rough crowd of sailors, mariners and mercenaries and one of the best places to start an investigation into Sokol Keep. The tavern presents a good opportunity to introduce new characters to one another.": "冒险开始时，角色们正在 \"大笑的妖精\"，一个在弗兰码头有点名气的小酒馆。这是一个主要为水手、航海家和雇佣兵等粗犷人群提供服务的地方，也是开始调查索科尔堡的最佳地点之一。酒馆提供了一个很好的机会，可以把新的角色介绍给彼此。",
	"The Laughing Goblin is a large dark old tavern that has had better times. The woodwork is worn, the plaster once white is now yellowish and crumbling and the chandeliers and lanterns rusted. The furniture shows the signs of heavy use and the scars of various brawls.": "大笑的妖精是一个大型的黑暗的老酒馆，已经有了更好的时代。木制品已经破旧，曾经的白色石膏现在已经泛黄，摇摇欲坠，吊灯和灯笼已经生锈。家具显示出大量使用的痕迹和各种争吵的伤痕。",
	"A thin human female with long, black hair is cleaning tankards behind the bar while chatting with an bald, overweight human male in the tavern's livery sitting on a bar stool. The sounds of cooking and the strong smell of cabbage soup comes from the kitchen. At this time of the day the there are few guests, but it is not completely empty with the customers sitting quietly in various corners.": "一个黑色长发的瘦弱人类女性正在吧台后面清洗酒罐，同时与坐在酒吧凳子上的一个穿着酒馆制服的秃头、超重的人类男性聊天。厨房里传来做饭的声音和浓烈的白菜汤的味道。在这个时候，客人很少，但也不是完全空无一人，客人们安静地坐在各个角落里。",
	"The Laughing Goblin is an old and famous tavern in Phlan. It is described as follows:": "大笑的妖精是弗兰的一个古老而著名的酒馆。它的描述如下。",
	"The common room has two floors with a large, open space in the middle containing the bar, a stage, and a large fireplace.": "公用室有两层，中间有一个巨大的开放空间，包含酒吧、舞台和一个大壁炉。",
	"A number of booths line the walls, and tables fill the rest of the room's open space.": "墙壁上有一些展位，而桌子则摆满了房间的其他开放空间。",
	"The only decoration in the common room is a large carved totem resembling a laughing goblin. The totem is clearly very old and is well-worn.": "公共房间里唯一的装饰是一个巨大的雕刻图腾，类似于一个笑的妖精。这个图腾显然非常古老，而且磨损严重。",
	"When the characters enter the tavern, the waiter shouts they can sit wherever they want-except for the second floor-and that he will get to them soon. It actually takes some probing from either the characters or the bartender to get him to take orders. Characters that look around see the other characters, giving a good opportunity for the players to describe their characters, as well as the other guests. See \"Starting a Conversation\" for more details.": "当人物进入酒馆时，服务员喊道，他们可以坐在任何他们想坐的地方--除了二楼，而且他很快就会去找他们。实际上，无论是人物还是酒保，都要经过一番试探才能让他接单。四处张望的角色会看到其他角色，这给了玩家一个很好的机会来描述他们的角色以及其他客人。更多细节请参见 \"开始对话\"。",
	"Characters sitting at the bar have the opportunity to meet {@b Imizael}. Though she is human, her name is clearly elven (her mother was obsessed with elves).": "坐在酒吧里的角色有机会见到（%0%）。虽然她是人类，但她的名字显然是精灵族的（她的母亲对精灵族很着迷）。",
	"Imizael is quite busy, but is attentive of her patrons' needs. She responds to questions curtly, nodding when it is polite and directing customers with a fondness for gossip to Fat Mar, whom she insists \"should keep his equally fat nose out of other peoples' business.\"": "伊米萨伊尔相当忙碌，但对顾客的需求却很关注。她礼貌地回答问题，礼貌地点头，并将喜欢八卦的顾客引向胖子马，她坚持认为胖子马 \"应该把他同样肥胖的鼻子放在别人的生意之外\"。",
	"Characters sitting in at the tables may speak with the waiter, who breathlessly introduces himself as Fat Mar.": "坐在桌边的人物可以与服务员交谈，服务员气喘吁吁地介绍自己是肥马。",
	"Fat Mar clearly dislikes his nickname, but it is well-earned. He is a rotund man who sweats profusely. He has a sharp tongue and a foul mouth but warms up instantly to anyone who asks what his actual name is-introducing himself happily as Markoth Hasselpond.": "胖马显然不喜欢他的绰号，但这是他应得的。他是一个肥胖的人，汗流浃背。他有一个尖锐的舌头和一张臭嘴，但对任何问及他的真实姓名的人都会立即热情起来--愉快地介绍自己是马科思-哈塞尔邦德。",
	"Both Markoth and Imizael happily recommend the tavern's famous cabbage soup. It is an old secret recipe that comes with freshly baked bread and a piece of cheese. Otherwise the tavern serves a salty fish stew or the catch of the day (pike; the Moonsea is a freshwater lake). The drink list is extensive, but the advice is to stick to light ale, stout or the really strong stuff. The wine is just not particularly appetizing.": "马科斯和伊米萨伊尔都高兴地推荐酒馆著名的卷心菜汤。这是一个古老的秘方，附带新鲜出炉的面包和一块奶酪。除此之外，酒馆还提供咸鱼炖菜或当天的渔获（梭鱼；月海是一个淡水湖）。饮料清单很丰富，但建议坚持喝淡啤酒、黑啤酒或真正浓烈的东西。酒就不是特别合胃口了。",
	"Markoth loves to gossip and to tell stories, the taller the better. He even knows a few about Sokol Keep. In the course of discussion with Markoth, he relates the following:": "马科斯喜欢八卦和讲故事，越高大上越好。他甚至知道一些关于Sokol Keep的情况。在与Markoth讨论的过程中，他讲述了以下内容。",
	"The beacon at Sokol Keep went out two days ago, and no one knows why.": "索科尔堡的灯塔两天前熄灭了，没有人知道原因。",

	"Legends say that it used to be a temple and the spirits of dead priests haunt a buried treasure beneath the keep.": "传说这里曾经是一座寺庙，死去的祭司的灵魂在守卫下的一个埋藏的宝藏里出没。",
	"House Sokol owns the Keep, but they are a relatively new house. They are a young noble house raised up by the first Lord Protector.": "索科尔家族拥有这个城堡，但他们是一个相对较新的家族。他们是一个年轻的贵族家族，由第一任保护者大人抚养长大。",
	"The only reason House Sokol still bothers with it is because it is still a small source of income; and with trade the way it is, they need all the help they can get.": "Sokol之家仍在为之烦恼的唯一原因是，它仍然是一个小的收入来源；而随着贸易的发展，他们需要所有他们能得到的帮助。",
	"There aren't many folks that still work in the Keep; mostly members of House Sokol and a handful of Black Fist guards.": "仍然在堡垒工作的人不多；大部分是索科尔家族的成员和少数黑拳卫士。",
	"Word is that a spirit ship full of monstrous pirates has been attacking villages on the Moonsea. If that's the case, Sokol Keep is Phlan's first line of defense.": "有消息称，一艘满载着畸形海盗的灵船一直在攻击月海的村庄。如果是这样的话，索科尔堡就是弗兰的第一道防线。",
	"Obviously, the fact that the lights of the beacon went out is the talk of the day in Phlan. Neither House Sokol nor the Black Fist appears to be doing anything about it both accusing the other of foul play. Others think that the authorities know something foul is now stalking the island and they are too afraid to send in soldiers to deal with the situation. But the fact is that something needs to be done soon or things will go wrong at the docks. Hopefully the characters are the right people to deal with it?": "显然，烽火台的灯光熄灭的事实是普兰市一天的话题。索科尔家族和黑拳组织似乎都没有采取任何措施，都指责对方犯规。还有人认为，当局知道现在有邪恶的东西在岛上徘徊，但他们太害怕了，不敢派士兵来处理这种情况。但事实是，需要尽快做些什么，否则码头上的事情就会出问题。希望这些人物是处理此事的合适人选？",
	"Besides the Markoth and Imizael, there are a few other guests. None of the customers are looking for a conversation with one or more random strangers, but nor are they actively hostile against the idea. Use the list of rumors to spice up the conversations.": "除了马科斯和伊米萨伊尔，还有其他一些客人。没有一个客人想和一个或多个随机的陌生人谈话，但他们也没有主动敌视这个想法。用谣言清单来调剂谈话的内容。",
	"{@b Ortal Gruk.} He is a half-orc, nursing his drink in a dark corner. Anyone buying him a drink gets a tale about a pack of vengeful spirits that live beneath Sokol Keep and speculates that it was these spirits that put out the beacon.": "{@b Ortal Gruk.} 他是一个半兽人，在一个黑暗的角落里喝着酒。任何请他喝酒的人都会得到一个关于住在索科尔堡下面的一群复仇的灵魂的故事，并猜测是这些灵魂放出了信标。",
	"{@b Welby and Grent.} Two halfling merchants that deal primarily in ropes, wood and dried food from the Dalelands. They are enjoying their lunch and share that they are stuck here until the situation at Sokol Keep is resolved and they are not happy about the money that the delay is costing them.": "{@b Welby and Grent.} 两个半身人商人，主要经营来自达利兰的绳索、木材和干粮。他们正在享受他们的午餐，并分享他们被困在这里，直到索科尔堡的情况得到解决，他们对延迟的金钱损失感到不高兴。",

They glare at any characters that interrupt them and go back to their discussion after issuing a few choice insults.": "{@b Tibeem, Spernik and Ellison.}三个手和衬衫都沾满墨水的人，在晚餐时一起喝酒，低声自言自语。他们瞪着任何打断他们的人物，并在发出一些有选择的侮辱后继续他们的讨论。",

	"Allow the characters some time to interact with the people at the bar before starting the following encounter. Let the dockworkers enter earlier if the players are unsure of what to do or when the characters start pushing Keria and Aravele for information.": "在开始下面的遭遇战之前，让角色有时间与酒吧里的人互动。如果玩家不确定该怎么做，或者当角色开始向Keria和Aravele逼问信息时，让码头工人提前进入。",
	"BANG! The door is violently thrown open as a half-dozen burly drunk dockworkers barge in. They seem quite angry. Without sparing anybody a glance, they march towards the two mercenaries moping over their drinks.": "砰! 门被猛地推开，半打粗壮的醉酒码头工人闯了进来。他们似乎很生气。他们没有看任何人一眼，就朝那两个闷头喝酒的雇佣兵走去。",
	"\"Your friends in the Keep are costing us work! Where are they hiding?\" bellows one to the woman at the table.": "\"你在堡垒的朋友让我们失去了工作! 他们躲在哪里？\"一个人对桌子上的女人吼道。",
	"\"Sod off, Thirus,\" one of the mercenaries growls; obviously in no mood for a chat, \"Crawl back into the hole you came from before you and your friends get hurt.\"": "\"滚开，蒂鲁斯，\"其中一个雇佣兵咆哮道；显然没有心情聊天。\"在你和你的朋友受伤之前，爬回你来的那个洞里去。\"",
	"The dockworkers are clearly looking for a fight and the mercenaries look perfectly happy giving it to them. Markoth and Imizael, however, would clearly prefer to avoid one.": "码头工人显然在寻找一场战斗，而雇佣兵们看起来非常乐意给他们战斗。然而，马科斯和伊米扎尔显然更愿意避免一场战斗。",
	"Any character who engages with both sides of the argument and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check, manages to defuse the situation before it devolves into violence.": "任何角色如果与争论双方接触，并在DC15魅力（劝说或恐吓）检查中成功，就能在局势演变成暴力之前设法化解。",
	"If the characters are unable to defuse the situation, Imizael gives it a try from the bar, but fails miserably when Keria grabs the most vocal of the six dockworkers and slams his face into the table, knocking him out cold, at which point Aravele jumps into the fight. As the fight starts, the other patrons quickly move out of the way and begin taunting and cheering the belligerents.": "如果这些人物无法化解局势，伊米扎尔就在酒吧里试一试，但却惨遭失败，克里亚抓住六个码头工人中最有发言权的一个，把他的脸撞到桌子上，把他撞晕了，这时阿拉维勒跳进了战斗。随着战斗的开始，其他顾客迅速避开，开始嘲弄和欢呼交战者。",
	"If the characters choose to support a particular side, the other side will attack them. If not, then a separate group of six {@creature commoner|mm|commoners} (dockworkers) attack the characters at the beginning of the next round as the brawl begins in earnest.": "如果人物选择支持某一方，另一方将攻击他们。如果不支持，那么在下一轮开始时，六人（%0%）（码头工人）会单独攻击人物，因为争吵开始了。",
	"During the brawl, all of the NPCs use unarmed attacks. Should a character's hit points be reduced to zero, none of them are in danger of dying, and need not attempt saving throws to avoid doing so, although Markoth will brave the sea of fists, chairs and tankards to drag them out of the fight to prevent them from getting injured further.": "在争吵中，所有的NPC都使用徒手攻击。如果一个角色的命中率降低到零，他们都不会有死亡的危险，也不需要尝试拯救动作来避免死亡，尽管马可斯会勇敢地在拳头、椅子和酒杯的海洋中把他们拖出战斗，防止他们进一步受伤。",
	"An unarmed strike is a simple melee weapon that deals 1 bludgeoning damage. Characters with the {@feat Tavern Brawler} feat deal 1d4 damage with an unarmed strike. {@class monk|phb|Monks} deal damage based on level and other class features.": "徒手攻击是一种简单的近战武器，可以造成1次重击伤害。拥有{@feat Tavern Brawler}特技的角色用徒手攻击造成1d4的伤害。{@class monk|phb|Monks}造成的伤害基于等级和其他等级特征。",
	"{@b If the characters are unable to stop the brawl}, the fight is over when all of the NPCs from whatever side the characters antagonize are unconscious, Imizael is obviously upset at everyone involved and shoos everyone out, then closes the tavern to clean up.": "{@b If the characters are unable to stop the brawl}，当所有与角色对立的一方的NPC都失去知觉时，战斗就结束了，伊米萨伊尔显然对所有参与的人都很不满，把所有人都赶了出去，然后关闭酒馆，进行清理。",
	"After the brawl, both the dockworkers and the mercenaries are outside the tavern licking their wounds. Whichever group the characters assisted in the fight boisterously thanks them for their help. The other scowls and mutters at them under their breath. Their attitude can be improved by succeeding at a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If this check is successful, they are able to get additional information from both groups, otherwise, only the group the characters helped in the fight (if any) will share with them.": "争吵过后，码头工人和雇佣兵都在酒馆外舔着自己的伤口。角色们在战斗中协助的那一组人沸沸扬扬地感谢他们的帮助。另一个则皱着眉头，暗自嘀咕。他们的态度可以通过成功进行DC10魅力（说服力）检查来改善。如果这个检定成功，他们就能从两组人那里得到额外的信息，否则，只有在战斗中帮助过他们的那组人（如果有的话）会和他们分享。",
	"{@b If the characters stop the brawl}, Izimael-glad that the characters were able to defuse the argument- happily buys a round of drinks for them. Both the mercenaries and dockworkers are happy to share what rumors they know about with the characters.": "{@b If the characters stop the brawl}，Izimael很高兴这些人物能够化解争论，高兴地给他们买了一轮饮料。雇佣兵和码头工人都很乐意与人物分享他们所知道的传闻。",
	"It should be made clear to the characters that none of the participants in the brawl are wielding weapons in the fight. Neither side uses weapons for good reason; the Black Fist ignores a brawl, but not assault and murder.": "应该让人物明白，参与斗殴的人都没有在战斗中挥舞武器。双方都没有使用武器的充分理由；黑拳无视斗殴，但无视殴打和谋杀。",
	"If the characters draw steel and don't kill anybody (choosing to knock somebody unconscious instead of making the killing blow), let it slide. Assume that their actions later in the adventure provide enough reasons to ignore the crime. Murder, however, is another issue, and could be punishable by death at the end of a rope if the characters are caught. Any character that kills a brawler earns the {@i Emnity of the Black Fist} (see \"Rewards\").": "如果角色们拔出了钢钎，但没有杀人（选择把人打晕而不是做出致命一击），那就让它过去。假设他们在冒险过程中的行动提供了足够的理由来忽略这一罪行。然而，谋杀是另一个问题，如果角色被抓到，可能会被处以绳索末端的死刑。任何杀死斗殴者的角色都会获得（%0%）的奖励（见 \"奖励\"）。",
	"Regardless of whether or not the characters stopped or participated in the fight, they can talk with the dockworkers and/or the mercenaries to get more information.": "无论人物是否停止或参与了战斗，他们都可以与码头工人和/或雇佣兵交谈，以获得更多信息。",

	"Grim has befriended Igan Sokol, the quartermaster in charge of the keep; a somewhat naive, enthusiastic young man eager to make a name for himself amongst his house.": "格里姆结识了负责守卫的军需官伊甘-索科尔；一个有些天真、热情的年轻人，渴望在他的家族中扬名立万。",
	"Grim mentioned a treasure below the keep and that he was close to finding it. They are pretty sure he was spinning tall tales, as usual.": "格里姆提到在堡垒下面有一个宝藏，而且他就快找到它了。他们非常肯定他像往常一样在编造高大的故事。",

	"As the characters are leaving, the Black Fist arrives, cudgels in hand. Unless a character intentionally does something intentionally to draw their attention, the guards merely rudely shove their way past them to get inside the tavern. Any character with a lick of sense knows that it's probably a good idea to make themselves scarce; something that the dockworkers make sure the characters understand before they, themselves, vanish into the crowd.": "当角色们离开时，黑拳头来到了这里，手里拿着棍子。除非有角色故意做一些事情来吸引他们的注意，否则卫兵们只是粗暴地推开他们，进入酒馆。任何有理智的人物都知道，让自己变得稀少可能是个好主意；码头工人在他们自己消失在人群中之前，确保了这些人物明白这一点。",

	"Guard Sergeant Hurn is old and just riding out the last few years he has left before he can retire. While not as corrupt as your average guardsman, Hurn would definitely not turn away a bribe. He is, for the most part, ineffective; the docks would be just as safe (or dangerous) without his presence.": "守卫军士长胡恩年事已高，只是在退休前度过了他所剩无几的几年。虽然不像一般警卫员那样腐败，但胡恩绝对不会拒绝贿赂。在大多数情况下，他是无效的；没有他的存在，码头也一样安全（或危险）。",

	"The island is three hundred feet from shore and will take a swimmer {@dice 2d4+2} hours to reach.

	"While it is easy to find a boat for sale or rent, they must pay its owner 5 gp for the rental and a 25 gp deposit in case they damage or lose it. Getting to the island is easy enough, but avoiding the rocks requires either successful a DC 10 Wisdom (Nature) by the navigator or a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check by the rower to avoid dashing the boat against the rocks. Failure results in the boat being damaged (not seaworthy unless repaired).": "虽然很容易找到出售或出租的船，但他们必须向船主支付5戈比的租金和25戈比的押金，以防他们损坏或丢失。到岛上去很容易，但要避开岩石，需要领航员成功地进行DC 10智慧（自然）检查，或者划船者成功地进行DC 10力量（运动）检查，以避免将船撞向岩石。失败的结果是船被损坏（除非修复否则不适合航海）。",
	"The easiest, cheapest and safest method of arriving on the island is by ferry. The ferryman, Karst, is a bitter, elderly fellow who has worked as a ferryman for nearly forty years. The events in Phlan have taken its toll on his livelihood and he has not seen much in the way of coin. Were it not for his old age he would have left long ago. He is willing to ferry the characters to the island for 1 gp and a flimsy excuse. If they have obtained permission from House Sokol or the Black Fist, he does it for free. Karst doesn't talk much, but if asked will provide the following nuggets of insight:": "抵达该岛的最简单、最便宜和最安全的方法是乘坐渡轮。摆渡人卡斯特是一个痛苦的老家伙，他做了近40年的摆渡人。普兰岛的事件使他的生计受到影响，他没有看到多少硬币。如果不是因为他年事已高，他早就离开了。他愿意用1个金币和一个站不住脚的借口把这些人物渡到岛上。如果他们获得了索科尔家族或黑拳组织的许可，他就会免费为他们提供服务。卡斯特话不多，但如果被问到，他会提供以下的见解要点。",
	"He knows Darvag, Shandra, and Rorin, and spoke to them the day prior. They appear to be in good health.": "他认识达尔瓦格、桑德拉和罗林，并在前一天与他们交谈过。他们看起来健康状况良好。",
	"The Black Fist have a detachment of six guards on the island at any given time.": "黑拳组织在任何时候都有一支由六名卫兵组成的分队在岛上。",
	"Being chosen for the detail is usually a punishment for some infraction of the rules.": "被选中参加这个细节，通常是对某些违反规则的行为的惩罚。",
	"He doesn't know about any dead clerics, but his \"gram\" (grandmother) used to tell him that the island was full of spirits, not that he has actually seen any before.": "他不知道有什么死去的神职人员，但他的 \"gram\"（祖母）曾经告诉他，岛上充满了灵魂，但他以前并没有真正见过任何灵魂。",
	"A sandy, wind-buffeted islet rests offshore in the Bay of Phlan, Thorn Island serves as a natural breakwater against the ravages of the Moonsea.": "荆棘岛是一个沙质的、被风吹动的小岛，位于普兰湾的近海，是抵御月海肆虐的天然防波堤。",
	"The isle's most prominent feature is Sokol Keep, fortress and former headquarters of the formidable Sokol merchant house. A beacon atop the highest tower of the Keep serves as a lighthouse for ships entering the Bay of Phlan. Strong currents and rocks make getting to the isle somewhat problematic for the inexperienced sailor especially in the dark.": "该岛最突出的特点是索科尔堡，它是强大的索科尔商行的堡垒和前总部。堡垒最高的塔顶上有一座灯塔，作为进入弗兰湾的船只的灯塔。强劲的水流和岩石使得没有经验的水手在前往该岛时有些困难，尤其是在黑暗中。",
	"There is a small quay on the eastern extend of the isle as well as a couple of large wooden warehouses. The dock and houses look like they have seen better times, but they are still sturdy. The warehouses are empty except for one that is filled with lumber and stones; building materials for the keep.": "在岛的东边有一个小码头，以及几个大的木制仓库。码头和房屋看起来像是经历过更好的时代，但它们仍然很坚固。仓库是空的，只有一个仓库装满了木材和石块；这些都是守卫的建筑材料。",
	"The Keep is mostly abandoned except for the spiders, mice, a cat or two and a few noteworthy individuals.": "除了蜘蛛、老鼠、一两只猫和几个值得注意的人之外，该堡垒大部分被遗弃。",
	"Harae was a priestess of Tyr who died in the Dragon Run, a draconic invasion, almost 200 years ago. In life, she was a patient and just follower of Tyr but in the time since her death, she has lost much of her ability to relate with the living. She is a particularly weak spirit, unable to do much beyond move small objects around.": "Harae是泰尔的女祭司，近200年前死于龙族的入侵，在龙族的入侵中。在生活中，她是一个耐心而公正的泰尔的追随者，但在她死后的这段时间里，她已经失去了很多与活人交往的能力。她是一个特别虚弱的灵魂，除了移动小物件外，不能做很多事情。",
	"She was grateful when Igan expressed an interest in restoring the shrine and became furious when Grim and his companions murdered the boy; angry at herself for not having seen it coming and mad at the Black Fist for the treachery and the injustice of it all. The anger led her to extinguish the beacon-an attempt to lure other to the island to exact vengeance.": "当伊甘表示有兴趣恢复神殿时，她很感激，而当格力姆和他的同伴们谋杀了那个男孩时，她变得很愤怒；她为自己没有看到这一切而愤怒，为黑拳的背叛和不公正而疯狂。愤怒使她熄灭了灯塔，试图引诱其他人到岛上来复仇。",
	"As a follower of the god of justice, she wants the Black Fist soldiers brought before a court of law more than anything. To that end, she does what she is able to do to help the characters get down below, such as showing the journal in the East Tower and by making sure they realize the importance of the Book of Moonsea Cults in Igan's Quarters.": "作为正义之神的追随者，她最希望黑拳士兵被送上法庭。为此，她尽其所能地帮助下面的人物，比如给他们看东塔里的日记，并确保他们认识到伊根宿舍里的《月海崇拜之书》的重要性。",
	"Harae (lawful good) has been dead a good while, and being dead is dull. She watched Igan grow up from a small child and when Igan found the shrine that she is bound to, she saw the spark of goodness. When he was killed, Harae was devastated. She is now consumed with the need for his killers to face justice. The groundskeepers have been no help, and she has grown desparate and her limited abilities in communication.": "Harae（合法的善）已经死了好一阵子了，而死了就会很沉闷。她看着伊甘从小到大的成长，当伊甘找到她所绑定的神龛时，她看到了善良的火花。当他被杀时，Harae受到了很大的打击。她现在一心想要让杀他的人面对正义。地面管理员没有任何帮助，她已经变得很绝望了，而且她的沟通能力有限。",
	"Harae is typically in the East Tower, and upon the characters entering it, she immediately takes an active interest in them, and will follow them for the remainder of the adventure, so long as they remain on Thorn Island. This begins as simply as a few items being knocked to the ground or an unseen and unfelt breeze mussing their hair. This is the extent of Harae's ability to influence her environment. She is unable to manifest herself, and thus is {@condition invisible}.": "Harae通常在东塔，当人物进入东塔时，她会立即对他们产生积极的兴趣，并会在冒险的剩余时间里跟踪他们，只要他们还在荆棘岛上。这开始时只是一些物品被撞到地上，或者是一阵看不见摸不着的微风吹乱了他们的头发。这就是Harae影响她的环境的能力的范围。她无法显化自己，因此是（%0%）。",
	"She is initially indifferent towards visitors. However, her attitude changes depending on the characters. Her attitude changes to friendly towards any character who:": "她最初对来访者无动于衷。然而，她的态度会根据人物的不同而改变。她对任何人物的态度都会转变为友好。",
	"Is an open-worshipper of a lawful good deity.": "是一个合法善神的公开崇拜者。",
	"Attempt to engage the spirit in conversation and succeeds at a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check.": "试图与灵魂对话，并在DC10魅力（说服力）检查中获得成功。",
	"Explores the Keep without stealing anything and treat the groundskeepers with respect.": "在不偷窃任何东西的情况下探索堡垒，并以尊重的态度对待地面管理员。",
	"Conversely, she becomes immediately unfriendly towards any character who:": "反之，她对任何角色都会立即变得不友好。",
	"Openly worships an evil deity.": "公然崇拜邪恶的神灵。",
	"Steals from the Keep or treats the groundskeepers cruelly.": "从城堡里偷东西或残忍地对待地面管理员。",
	"If she recognizes that the characters are trying to figure out what happened to Igan and she is friendly towards a majority of the characters, she helps in area 4 and answers any questions posed by characters that she is friendly to. Creative characters who are aware of her presence may devise a form of \"yes or no\" communication. She knows precise details about what transpired here, where the Black Fist are, and the entrance to and inhabitants of the temple. However, she has long since forgotten about hazards that pose no danger to her, such as sinkholes.": "如果她认识到角色们正试图弄清楚伊甘发生了什么，而且她对大多数角色都很友好，她就会在第4区提供帮助，并回答她所友好的角色提出的任何问题。意识到她存在的创造性人物可以设计一种 \"是或不是 \"的交流方式。她知道关于这里发生的事情的精确细节，黑拳头在哪里，以及神庙的入口和居民。然而，她早已忘记了那些对她不构成危险的危险，例如天坑。",
	"While Igan Sokol was the quartermaster of the keep, House Sokol assigned other retainers to the keep for the more menial tasks. A middle-aged groundskeeper Darvag (male human) is in charge of upkeep of the structure and grounds and his wife, Shandra (female human) was primarily responsible for ensuring the interior of the keep was clean and meals prepared. Their son, Rorin (male human), acts an aide to both of them as needed.": "虽然伊甘-索科尔是守卫的军需官，但索科尔家族向守卫指派了其他家臣，负责更多琐碎的工作。一个中年的地面管理员达尔瓦格（男性人类）负责结构和地面的维护，他的妻子珊德拉（女性人类）主要负责确保堡垒内部的清洁和膳食准备。他们的儿子罗林（男性人类）根据需要充当他们两人的助手。",
	"If the characters approach the island in any way other than swimming, the retainers of House Sokol know that they are coming and meet them at the shore.": "如果人物以游泳以外的任何方式接近该岛，索科尔家族的家臣就会知道他们要来，并在岸边迎接他们。",
	"Recent events have scared the remaining servants. Their supervisor and security have gone missing and a spirit is haunting the Keep. But they have a job to do. Despite their fear, it is business as usual. However, the servants refuse to enter the East Tower and Lighthouse. They are inherently distrustful of strangers, but relieved that the city has sent people to investigate.": "最近的事件让剩下的仆人们感到害怕。他们的主管和保安都失踪了，一个幽灵在城堡里出没。但他们还有工作要做。尽管他们很害怕，但还是照常工作。然而，仆人们拒绝进入东塔和灯塔。他们对陌生人本来就不信任，但对城市派人来调查感到欣慰。",
	"Despite distrusting strangers, they eagerly tell the characters what they know in the hopes that they will find Igan and the guards and purge the Keep of the haunting spirit.": "尽管不信任陌生人，但他们还是急切地告诉人物他们所知道的事情，希望他们能找到伊甘和卫兵，并将Keep的鬼魂清除掉。",
	"The guards change somewhat regularly, and the only one whose name they know is Grim.": "守卫有些定期更换，他们唯一知道的名字是格里姆。",
	"Guardsmen typically assigned to the Keep didn't seem to like the assignment to the lighthouse, and suspect that it was a form of punishment for troublesome members of the Black Fist.": "通常被分配到堡垒的守卫者似乎并不喜欢被分配到灯塔，并怀疑这是对黑拳组织麻烦成员的一种惩罚。",
	"Guard Sergeant Grim has been the ranking guardsman at the Keep for the last month.": "在过去的一个月里，守卫警长格里姆一直是堡垒的高级守卫者。",
	"Igan Sokol, their supervisor, and the sergeant were often together and would engage in long conversations out of earshot of others. Their friendship seemed odd.": "他们的主管伊甘-索科尔（Igan Sokol）和中士经常在一起，会在别人听不到的地方进行长谈。他们的友谊似乎很奇怪。",
	"Sergeant Grim seemed a nice enough fellow. He treated the servants with respect and genuinely seemed to like Igan.": "格里姆中士似乎是个不错的家伙。他对仆人们很尊重，而且似乎真的很喜欢伊根。",
	"Igan Sokol is a nice young man who read frequently and was obsessed with the rumor of treasure that was supposedly hidden somewhere in the keep. They wouldn't have been surprised if he had torn the place down brick by brick in order to find it.": "伊甘-索科尔是个不错的年轻人，他经常阅读，对据说藏在堡垒某处的宝藏的传闻很着迷。如果他为了找到它而把这个地方一砖一瓦地拆掉，他们也不会感到惊讶。",
	"The beacon of the lighthouse is magical in nature. They do not know how to activate it but suggest that Igan's quarters would be a good starting-point to finding out how.": "灯塔的灯塔具有神奇的性质。他们不知道如何激活它，但建议伊甘的住处将是寻找方法的一个好起点。",
	"Most of the doors in the keep are locked, but Shandra will provide the characters with a key.": "堡垒中的大部分门都是锁着的，但珊德拉会向人物提供一把钥匙。",
	"Naturally, the servants know a fair bit of gossip as well, though they only deal out the juicy information if a character succeeds at a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.": "当然，仆人们也知道不少八卦，不过他们只在人物成功通过DC15魅力（说服力）检查的情况下才会透露出多汁的信息。",
	"Igan would frequently disappear for long stretches of time, usually to the East and West towers.": "伊甘经常会消失很长一段时间，通常是去东塔和西塔。",
	"A few of days ago Igan had been really excited, bursting with energy, but frustrated about the fact that sergeant Grim was not present; having - returned to the city for official reasons.": "几天前，伊甘真的很兴奋，精力充沛，但对格里姆中士不在的事实感到沮丧；他因公务原因回到了城市。",
	"On the evening that the beacon went out, they heard an unearthly wailing sound.": "在灯塔熄灭的那天晚上，他们听到了一种不寻常的哀号声。",
	"The beacon was off and they did not know how to turn it back on.": "信标已关闭，他们不知道如何将其重新打开。",
	"Ever since that evening, all sorts of weird things are happening; things falling down without reason, strange knocking sounds, etc. It has happened everywhere in the keep, but seems to get worse around East Tower. Nothing gets permanently damaged, nor is anybody ever hurt.": "从那天晚上开始，各种奇怪的事情都在发生；东西无缘无故地掉下来，奇怪的敲击声，等等。这样的事情在整个监狱都有发生，但在东塔附近似乎更严重。没有任何东西被永久损坏，也没有任何人受伤。",
	"The Black Fist soldiers have been stationed on the Keep to overlook the lighthouse and to protect it against anyone, including House Sokol, who would extinguish the beacon. It is very important to the city, and as such, central in the political maneuvering of the city's power players.": "黑拳组织的士兵一直驻扎在堡垒上，俯瞰灯塔，保护它不被任何人，包括索科尔家族，熄灭灯塔。它对城市非常重要，因此在城市的权力人物的政治操纵中处于核心地位。",
	"Contrary to popular belief, the Black Fist select the more disciplined members for the duty, and try to rotate the soldiers regularly. The typical rotation is three days. Still, it is not a popular assignment. There are few opportunities for earning cash on the side and it is quite boring. Grim has been paying his supervisors to ensure that he has been repeatedly assigned to the Keep and to make sure that the guards he selected were assigned to the Keep.": "与流行的看法相反，黑拳组织选择更有纪律的成员来执行任务，并设法定期轮换士兵。典型的轮换是三天。不过，这并不是一项受欢迎的任务。赚取现金的机会很少，而且相当无聊。格里姆一直在付钱给他的主管，以确保他多次被分配到堡垒，并确保他挑选的卫兵被分配到堡垒。",
	"The guards were quartered in the lighthouse.": "卫兵们在灯塔里驻扎。",
	"Sokol Keep dominates Thorn Island, a large stone fortress clearly built for defense. The castle looks old and it has obviously been repaired extensively in some areas. Despite its excellent repair it has an abandoned look about it. There are no banners, no guards patrolling its walls, no smoke rising from its chimneys and its gates are closed.": "索科尔堡主宰着荆棘岛，这是一座大型的石头堡垒，显然是为防御而建。这座城堡看起来很古老，而且显然在一些地方进行了广泛的修复。尽管它修得很好，但它有一种被遗弃的感觉。没有旗帜，没有卫兵在城墙上巡逻，没有烟囱冒烟，城门关闭。",
	"Wings of the home are blocked off, likely because of the small number of people who reside within. Anyone venturing within finds furniture covered by sheets in dusty, cobweb covered rooms. However, the parts that are not blocked off are clean and well-maintained.": "住宅的两翼被封锁了，可能是因为住在里面的人不多。任何进入这里的人都会发现，在布满灰尘和蜘蛛网的房间里，家具被床单覆盖。然而，没有被封锁的部分是干净的，维护良好的。",
	"A large mansion has replaced almost half of the original structure and nearly all of the wooden outbuildings. The mansion appears to be quite comfortable though not very defensible; with large, glass windows instead of arrow-slits, etc.": "一座大宅子取代了几乎一半的原始结构和几乎所有的木制附属建筑。这座豪宅看起来相当舒适，虽然不是很好防守；有大的玻璃窗，而不是箭孔，等等。",
	"The grounds are well-maintained and in good repair.": "场地维护得很好，修理得很好。",
	"The open courtyard is empty save for a few practice dummies likely used by the Black Fist guards.": "空旷的院子里除了几个可能是黑拳卫士使用的练习用的假人之外，其他地方都是空的。",
	"The groundskeeper and his wife make sure that the main hallways and rooms are well lit by candles and oil-lamps, but the closed off sections of the mansion are dimly lit during the day and completely dark at night.": "地面管理员和他的妻子确保主要的走廊和房间都有充足的蜡烛和油灯照明，但大宅的封闭部分在白天光线昏暗，晚上则完全黑暗。",
	"The outside doors are made of thick oak wooden doors and are all locked. The door has 25 hit points, and the locks of high quality (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check).": "外面的门是由厚厚的橡木木门制成的，都是锁着的。门的命中率为25，锁的质量也很高（需要成功进行DC20的灵巧检查）。",
	"The inside doors are made of thin wood and unless specified otherwise are locked. Shandra will provide the characters with a key to the doors. Opening them without the key requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity check.": "里面的门是由薄木制成的，除非另有规定，否则都是锁着的。Shandra会给角色们提供一把门的钥匙。在没有钥匙的情况下打开门需要成功地进行DC10灵巧检查。",
	"The windows are closed with wooden shutters. They can be opened from the outside, although doing so is likely to cause a racket. The windows itself are made out of glass and bolted shut. Again, opening them is not hard, but it makes a lot of noise.": "窗户是用木质百叶窗关闭的。它们可以从外面打开，尽管这样做很可能会引起喧闹。窗户本身是用玻璃制成的，用螺栓固定。同样，打开它们并不难，但会产生很大的噪音。",
	"Igan's quarters are inside the modern mansion on the second floor overlooking the courtyard. The suite is not the master bedroom, but right next to it. The door into this area is locked with a simple lock (successful DC 10 Dexterity check to pick it), but the characters may open it with the key provided by Shandra.": "伊甘的宿舍在现代大宅内，位于二楼，可以俯瞰院子。这个套房不是主卧室，而是紧挨着它。进入这个区域的门是用一把简单的锁锁住的（成功通过DC 10的灵巧检查才能撬开），但人物可以用香德拉提供的钥匙打开。",
	"A quick glance shows that the three room suite-comprised of a bedroom, a sitting area and a small office-are in good repair and looks to have been cleaned recently. The wall and floors are richly decorated with carpets, paintings and tapestries depict various heroic scenes.": "一眼就能看出，这套三室一厅的房子--由一间卧室、一个起居室和一个小办公室组成--修缮得很好，看起来最近被打扫过。墙壁和地板上装饰着丰富的地毯、绘画和挂毯，描绘着各种英雄的场景。",
	"The room is untidy, but otherwise appears well-tended to; the bed is freshly made and a few piles of laundered clothes lay on the bench at its foot.": "房间很不整洁，但其他方面似乎被打理得很好；床是新铺的，床脚的长椅上放着几堆洗好的衣服。",
	"The quarters of Igan are a bit of a mess. For characters taking their time and investigating it, the room's description can be paraphrased as follows:": "伊甘的宿舍有点乱。对于慢慢调查的人物来说，房间的描述可以解读如下。",
	"It is a three-bedroom suite, with a sitting area, a sleeping chamber and a small office, each with a room that overlooks the courtyard below.": "这是一个三室一厅的套房，有一个起居室、一个睡房和一个小办公室，每个房间都可以俯瞰下面的庭院。",
	"The area looks lived in, and although it is definitively untidy, it is clean-everything has been dusted within the last couple days.": "这个区域看起来是住过的，尽管它肯定是不整洁的，但它是干净的--在过去几天里，所有东西都被打扫过。",
	"A bookcase full of books and scrolls stands beside a large, comfortable sofa with two large book laying on it; open to various pages.": "一个装满书籍和卷轴的书柜矗立在一个舒适的大沙发旁边，上面躺着两本大书；打开后是各种页面。",
	"The papers on desk have sketches, random musings and observations and rather shoddy attempts at poetry. The sketches depict mostly the keep and its people. The desk has three drawers, each secured with a simple lock (successful DC 10 Dexterity check to pick the lock). Inside the characters find more junk, but nothing special except for a sketch of what appears to be a shrine of sorts. Characters recognize it as dedicated to Tyr with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check.": "桌上的文件有素描、随机的思考和观察以及相当低劣的诗歌尝试。这些素描主要描绘的是城堡和它的人民。书桌有三个抽屉，每个抽屉都有一把简单的锁（成功通过DC10灵巧检查来开锁）。角色们在里面发现了更多的垃圾，但没有什么特别的东西，只有一张似乎是某种神龛的草图。角色通过DC15智力（宗教）检定成功后，可以认出它是献给泰尔的。",
	"The books and scrolls contain a wide array of subjects from heroic stories to dusty histories (mostly on the Moonsea region), from theological debate to dry lectures on law and from poetry to books on long dead languages, all sorted by subject.": "这些书籍和卷轴包含各种各样的主题，从英雄故事到尘封的历史（大多是关于月海地区的），从神学辩论到枯燥的法律讲座，从诗歌到早已死亡的语言书籍，都按主题进行分类。",
	"Characters succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check find a small pouch containing 5 platinum pieces (pp) and an old, tarnished silver holy symbol of Tyr hidden inside a hollow book.": "通过DC15智力（调查）检查成功的角色可以发现一个小袋子，里面有5个铂金碎片（pp）和一个古老的、被玷污的银制泰尔圣物标志，藏在一本空心书里。",
	"On the sofa is an ancient-looking book titled Moonsea Cults by Thalioss of Tyr. It is written completely in Thorass, an ancient derivate of Common. A {@spell comprehend languages} spell indicates that the book details various ancient cults and their religious practices complete with detailed sketches. The cults described within seem to be mostly those that worship demons, powerful spirits or simply cults of personality.": "沙发上有一本看起来很古老的书，名为《月海崇拜》，作者是泰尔的塔利斯。这本书完全是用索拉斯语写的，这是一种古老的普通话的衍生物。一个{@spell comprehend languages}的咒语表明，这本书详细介绍了各种古老的邪教和他们的宗教实践，并附有详细的草图。书中描述的邪教似乎主要是那些崇拜恶魔、强大的精神或简单的人格崇拜的邪教。",
	"Also on the sofa is a more modern book on potential curses and how to counteract them. The last appears to be based more on folk wisdom than actual fact as anyone with the Arcana skill can easily discern.": "沙发上还有一本更现代的关于潜在诅咒和如何抵制它们的书。最后一本似乎更多的是基于民间智慧，而不是实际的事实，因为任何拥有阿卡纳技能的人都可以轻易地分辨出来。",
	"The artwork depicts scenes of heroism and sacrifice; among them a female knight in shining armor facing a red dragon in a burning village and a priest bathed in light keeping a group of undead at bay while his congregation barricades itself within his church. The scenes are a bit idyllic in that the side of good always appears to be winning.": "艺术作品描绘了英雄主义和牺牲的场景；其中有一位身穿闪亮盔甲的女骑士在燃烧的村庄里面对一条红龙，还有一位沐浴在灯光下的牧师在他的会众在他的教堂里设置障碍时阻止了一群亡灵。这些场景有点像田园诗，因为善良的一方似乎总是获胜。",
	"Characters who succeed at a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check realize the scenes depicted are famous stories about followers of Tyr, the god of Justice.": "通过DC15智力（宗教）检查成功的角色会意识到所描述的场景是关于正义之神泰尔的信徒的著名故事。",
	"A small pouch containing 5 platinum pieces (pp) and a silver holy symbol worth 50 gp are found in the bookcase. These are the property of House Sokol; taking them would essentially be thievery, which reduces Harae's attitude towards the characters by one step.": "在书柜里发现了一个装有5个铂金块（pp）的小袋子和一个价值50gp的银质圣符。这些都是索科尔家族的财产；拿走它们实质上就是偷窃，这让原对人物的态度降低了一步。",
	"The tallest tower of the keep is located at the southern end right at the edge of the water. It is a slender round tower about 80 feet tall, consisting of three floors with the upper part being a large open space with a staircase running along the walls to the top. Originally it was a simple watchtower, but when House Sokol took over the place they refurnished it as a lighthouse.": "最高的塔楼位于南端，就在水的边缘。它是一个细长的圆塔，高约80英尺，由三层组成，上部是一个大的开放空间，有一个楼梯沿着墙壁延伸到顶部。最初它是一个简单的瞭望塔，但当索科尔家族接管这个地方时，他们把它重新装修成了一个灯塔。",
	"Since then, the lighthouse has housed the contingent of Black Fist guards assigned to the Keep. With the exception of the top level, the three floors of this lighthouse contain the guards' common area, barracks, and sergeant's quarters in that order.": "从那时起，这座灯塔就成了分配给堡垒的黑拳卫队的驻地。除了顶层之外，这座灯塔的三层楼依次是卫兵的公共区域、营房和军士的宿舍。",
	"The door to the floor that houses the beacon is locked and is opened with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check or smashed open with a successful DC 15 Strength check. It has a wrap-around balcony which gives an excellent view on the surrounding area including Thorn Island and the city of Phlan. The room above is accessed by a ladder and the crystal and brass beacon stands in the center. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) shows that nothing appears to be physically wrong with the device, but for some reason, it is not working. The device still radiates strong evocation magic.": "通往信标所在楼层的门是锁着的，如果成功地进行DC10灵巧检查，就可以打开，如果成功地进行DC15力量检查，就可以砸开。它有一个环绕式的阳台，可以看到周围的区域，包括荆棘岛和普兰市的美景。通过梯子可以进入上面的房间，水晶和黄铜的灯塔矗立在中心位置。成功通过DC10智力测试（阿卡纳）后，发现这个装置在物理上没有任何问题，但由于某种原因，它无法工作。这个装置仍然散发着强烈的召唤魔法。",
	"One of the bunks on the third floor holds 20 gp in a hidden compartment.": "三楼的一个床铺在一个暗格里放着20个金币。",
	"The East Tower lies directly behind the mansion and is part of the old keep. Before the destruction of the Keep in 1306 DR during the Dragon Run, the whole of the East Tower was filled by a vast library. It would be over one hundred and eighty years later that Igan would stumble upon the place. Fantasizing of hidden treasures, he kept the secret to himself instead of telling others within his house or the servants of the keep. As an older boy he would read some of the ancient books within, and worked in secret to restore the shrine.": "东塔位于大宅的正后方，是古堡的一部分。在1306年DR的龙行天下中，城堡被摧毁之前，整个东塔被一个巨大的图书馆填满。一百八十多年后，伊甘才偶然发现了这个地方。幻想着隐藏的宝藏，他把这个秘密留给自己，而不是告诉他家里的其他人或城堡里的仆人。作为一个大男孩，他将阅读其中的一些古书，并秘密工作以修复神殿。",
	"The tower is now used to store furniture, and thick layers of dust and cobwebs make it look like nobody has been in the tower for years.": "这座塔现在被用来存放家具，厚厚的灰尘和蜘蛛网使它看起来像多年来没有人在塔里。",
	"Anyone who is searching the first floor and succeeds at a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices that specific furniture against the far wall has been moved back and forth, as if block something from view. Should no character demonstrate an interest in searching the room, Harae will eventually knock over one of the chairs to draw the attention to a hidden door. Moving the furniture aside reveals a boarded over door, with a few loose planks at the bottom. With a bit of work, a medium-sized creature can squeeze through the opening.": "任何在一楼搜索并成功通过DC10智力（调查）检查的人都会注意到，靠着远处墙壁的特定家具被来回移动，似乎是在阻挡什么东西。如果没有人表现出对搜索房间的兴趣，Harae最终会推倒其中的一把椅子，以吸引人们对一扇隐藏的门的注意。把家具移到一边，就可以看到一扇用木板盖住的门，底部有几块松动的木板。经过一番努力，一个中等大小的生物可以从门缝中挤进去。",
	"Once through the door, the characters find themselves in a well-maintained shrine. A beautiful gray statue of a one-handed blind god stands at the end of the room, a small stone altar with an old looking brass scale at its feet. Two dusty cabinets on both sides of the altar are filled with books and scrolls, mostly on law, history and philosophy. Any character succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies the statue as one of Tyr. A beautiful reading desk of purple wood fills most of the remaining space. On the desk is the journal of Igan.": "一进门，人物就发现自己在一个维护良好的祠堂里。房间的尽头矗立着一尊美丽的灰色单手盲神雕像，脚下是一个小石坛，上面有一个看起来很旧的铜秤。祭坛两侧有两个布满灰尘的柜子，里面装满了书籍和卷轴，大部分是关于法律、历史和哲学的。任何人物只要通过DC15智力（宗教）检查成功，就能认出这个雕像是泰尔的。一张漂亮的紫木阅读桌占满了剩下的大部分空间。书桌上放着伊甘的日记。",
	"The journal lacks easy reference points. There are no dates, just random notes all over the page including sentences in the margins. It seems more like a collection of thoughts and notes than an actual journal. The handwriting is decent though.": "这本日记缺乏简单的参考点。没有日期，只有满页的随机笔记，包括空白处的句子。它看起来更像是思想和笔记的集合，而不是一本真正的日记。不过字迹还算端正。",
	"The journal is difficult to read. The entries ramble at length and consuming all of it takes at least two hours, but upon succeeding at a DC 10 Intelligence check, anyone reading the journal realizes the following:": "这本日记很难读。条目冗长，读完至少需要两个小时，但只要成功通过DC 10智力检查，任何读到这本日记的人都会意识到以下情况。",
