	"In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, several days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found \"something big,\" and that he'd pay you fifteen gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to \"take care of business.\"": "在永夜城，一个名叫冈德伦-洛克斯的矮人要求你把一马车的补给品带到城东南数日路程的范达林的粗犷定居点。冈德伦显然很兴奋，而且对他此行的原因有点保密，只说他和他的兄弟们发现了 \"大东西\"，而且他将支付你每人15个金币，以护送他的物资安全到达范达林的贸易站--巴特恩的物资。然后他骑着马在你前面出发了，还有一个叫西尔达-霍尔温特的战士护送，声称他需要提前到达 \"处理事务\"。",
