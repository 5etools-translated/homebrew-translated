	"In the Midgard setting, virtually any urban setting from a large town to a small city would work as a place to drop in this adventure—as long as the locale has a thriving economy where a bank would reasonably exist. The most applicable locations are Zobeck, Droisha in the Mharoti Empire, Per-Kush in Nuria Natal, or Valera in the Seven Cities.": "在米德加德的设定中，从大城镇到小城市，几乎所有的城市环境都可以作为这次冒险的落脚点--只要这个地方有繁荣的经济，银行可以合理地存在。最适用的地点是佐贝克、姆哈罗蒂帝国的Droisha、努里亚-纳塔尔的Per-Kush或七城的Valera。",

	"The PCs can use a number of tactics to try to locate the thieves. The most direct way would be to wander the city streets at night in areas where the robberies occurred, hoping to catch sight of their quarry. This can have varying degrees of success. Since the greed swarm isn't as concerned with stealth or with leaving its victims alive, the patrolling PCs could hear a victim's scream or stumble into the greed swarm overtaking a victim. The PCs' timely arrival could scare the greed swarm and valkruung into fleeing with the victim's valuables, giving the PCs a chance to follow the pair back to Kolchak's.": "PC可以使用一些策略来试图找到这些盗贼。最直接的方法是在晚上在发生抢劫的地区的城市街道上徘徊，希望能看到他们的猎物。这可能会有不同程度的成功。由于贪婪之群并不关心隐蔽性或让受害者活着，巡逻的NPC可能会听到受害者的尖叫声，或者偶然发现贪婪之群正在追赶受害者。PC们的及时到来可能会吓到贪婪之群和valkruung，使他们带着受害者的贵重物品逃走，从而使PC们有机会跟踪这两人回到Kolchak家。",

The crocotta believed the fort would make an ideal home, but the gates were still barred shut. Determined, it started digging beneath the palisade, encouraging the hyenas to assist. The digging undermined a section of wall on one of the buildings, causing a partial collapse and disturbing a pestilence swarm, the original bearers of the disease that killed the fort's inhabitants. The swarm, its cozy shelter now exposed to daylight, flew off. The pestilence swarm eventually attacked a nearby village (see {@area Pestilence Descends|tffpd|x}).

Fortunately for the PCs and the locals, the pestilence swarm no longer carries the disease it brought to the fort, the swarm's long period of dormancy leaving the disease without hosts.": "当NPC在附近的时候，突然的警报声提醒他们有危险。一个{@creature pestilence swarm|ToB2}({@loader Tome of Beasts 2|creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts 2.json})从天空中向东边降落。虫群落在附近的农作物上--不管是在田里还是在市场的摊位上--并开始吞噬它们。如果NPC希望这里的人有任何合作，他们就必须先对付这个虫群，因为附近地区的每个人的首要任务是在虫群破坏庄稼之前杀死或赶走它。对NPC和当地人来说，幸运的是，瘟疫蜂群不再携带它带到要塞的疾病，蜂群的长期休眠使疾病没有宿主。",
	"Once the swarm has been defeated, the area residents are quick to show their gratitude for any assistance the PCs provide, going so far as to offer free room and board and a round of drinks. From this point, any of the following can be used to prompt the PCs to investigate the fort.": "一旦打败了虫群，该地区的居民很快就会对NPC提供的任何援助表示感谢，甚至会提供免费的食宿和一轮饮料。从这一点出发，以下任何一项都可以用来促使NPC调查这个堡垒。",
	"A local authority figure (mayor, sheriff, alderman), concerned that the swarm came from the direction of the fort, approaches the PCs. The figure explains no one has heard from the fort in weeks. Usually they see a patrol or a rider coming in for supplies. The PCs are asked to investigate the fort and report back.": "一个地方当局的人物（市长、警长、市议员）担心蜂群来自要塞的方向，于是接近了NPC。他解释说，已经有好几个星期没有人从堡垒那里得到消息了。通常，他们会看到一支巡逻队或一个骑手来取物资。他们要求NPC调查堡垒并汇报情况。",
	"A local healer or cleric recognizes the swarm as a type of insect that spreads disease. Worried for the fort's safety, the healer asks the PCs to look in on the fort to see if any have fallen ill from insect bites.": "一个当地的治疗师或牧师认出了这个虫群是一种传播疾病的昆虫。由于担心堡垒的安全，治疗师要求NPC查看一下堡垒，看看是否有人因为昆虫叮咬而生病。",
	"A villager or farmer has a message that needs to be delivered to a relative, a soldier at the fort. The fort is in the direction in which the PCs are already headed.": "一个村民或农民有一个消息需要传递给一个亲戚，一个在堡垒的士兵。堡垒就在NPC已经前往的方向上。",

	"At some point between the locale of the pestilence swarm attack and the fort, the PCs are stalked by predators. Compsognathus are tiny creatures but can be dangerous to much larger prey when encountered in superior numbers. The patrols from the fort usually kill the creatures on sight. With the fort out of commission, the numbers of these little dinosaurs in the area have grown.": "在瘟疫群袭击的地点和要塞之间的某个时间点，NPC被掠食者盯上了。Compsognathus是一种微小的生物，但是当遇到数量众多的猎物时，它们会对更大的猎物产生危险。堡垒的巡逻队通常会当场杀死这些生物。随着要塞的停用，该地区的这些小恐龙的数量也在增加。",
	"The PCs are attacked by a {@creature swarm of compsognathus|ToB2} ({@loader Tome of Beasts 2|creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts 2.json}).

The swarm attacks from stealth if possible, coming at the PCs from the tall plains grass.": "NPC被一个{@creature swarm of compsognathus|ToB2}({@loader Tome of Beasts 2|creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts 2.json})攻击了。这些生物贪婪饥饿，愿意攻击一群人形生物，希望能拿下其中一个，或一个随行的生物，作为美餐。如果可能的话，虫群会从隐蔽处进攻，从高大的平原草丛中向NPC袭来。",
	"The fort is surrounded by a 12-foot-tall wooden palisade. The gate is barred from the inside. A successful DC 20 Strength check forces it open.

On a failed check, the creature is unable to make progress through the tangle. If the creature fails the check by 5 or more, it causes further collapse. The creature is {@condition restrained} until it or another creature succeeds on a DC 12 Strength check to shift some of the debris to release the trapped creature.": "鉴于资源的匮乏，除了一个建筑外，所有的底层建筑都是土质地板。大门东面的一段围墙已经倒塌，还有站在它附近的一部分建筑。北边的栅栏也有一段在下面挖了一个入口。成功通过DC10的灵巧检查，就可以穿过倒下的木头，穿过碎石进入马厩（（%1%））。如果检定失败，该生物就无法穿过纠结的地方。如果该生物的检查失败了5次或更多，它就会造成进一步的崩溃。该生物是{@condition restrained}，直到它或其他生物在DC12力量检查中成功转移一些残骸以释放被困的生物。",

	"The disease that swept through the fort was fatal to all who contracted it. As there were no living infected to transfer it, the PCs may move through the area without fear of contagion. However, extended contact with any humanoid remains in the fort might expose the PCs to a disease at your discretion. {@disease Cackle fever} and {@disease sewer plague} are appropriate choices for the disease.": "席卷整个要塞的疾病对所有感染者都是致命的。由于没有活的感染者来转移它，所以NPC可以在这个地区活动而不用担心被传染。然而，与堡垒中的任何人形残骸长时间接触，可能会使NPC接触到一种疾病，由你决定。{@disease Cackle fever}和{@disease sewer plague}是该疾病的合适选择。",
	"The interior of the palisade is mostly packed earth with occasional patches of grass. A covered stone well stands in the middle of the yard.

	"This wooden cabin stands against the eastern wall of the fort. A crest of polished brass is affixed over the front door. There are signs of attempted digging near the southeastern corner.

A decayed corpse lies in repose upon the bed.": "这座木屋靠着堡垒的东墙而立。前门上贴着一个抛光的铜制徽章。东南角附近有试图挖掘的痕迹。建筑内的恶臭掩盖了其整洁的外表。一张小桌子靠着南墙，一个书架靠着北墙。东墙有一张床和一个衣柜。一具腐烂的尸体静静地躺在床上。",
	"The wooden floor built into the cabin has kept the hyenas and the crocotta from digging into it, and thus it remains untouched by their depredations.

When the PCs enter Area 5, the crocotta uses its Mimicry trait to make faint cries for help to draw the PCs upstairs, where it lurks near the bunks.

Sylvia appears much the same as she did in life, but with a broken neck, which causes her head to sag slightly forward and her patchy hair to obscure her face.

	"The temple, built in a small vale off a remote mountain pass, was a sacred spot for pilgrims and a peaceful shelter for passing travelers. At the end of her days, one of the temple priestesses fell from the path and consorted with a demon, seeking prolonged life. The priestess eventually regretted her decision and attempted to rebuke the demon, reneging on her bargain. She paid a price for her rebellion. Her soul was damned as her body became a fiendish vessel. This loathsome monster began slowly killing the priests that tended the temple, as well as their servants and the temple's guests.

	"The temple's monster, a {@creature hantu penanggal|ToB2} ({@loader Tome of Beasts 2|creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts 2.json}), passes for human during the daylight hours. The creature uses the persona of Sister Sorakan, her former mortal name. She presents herself as a lay priest and the last remaining adherent of the Mountain Lotus Temple. She appears as an elderly human woman, short and slight of frame. Her white hair is coiled into a bun. She wears a priest's robe as she goes about her duties. The hantu penanggal has been challenged by heroes in the past but has always been victorious. However, it has had its body destroyed on several occasions, claiming new ones from victims when it can. Currently, while its head appears as an old woman, the body the hantu penanggal wears once belonged to a young man, a merchant's apprentice who met his fate staying overnight at the temple.

	"Sister Sorakan is meek, respectful, and helpful to a fault. She sees to the needs of visitors as best she can, showing them to the guest quarters ({@area 3|mlt3|u}) should they wish to stay. She serves tea and allows visitors entrance into the temple for prayer and meditation. She doesn't break her act if provoked; instead, she acts fearful and pitiful in the face of any hostility against her, fleeing to the safety of the temple if given the opportunity. If asked why she is here alone, she claims that the clergy who ran the temple passed away over a year ago. Being such a remote place, no other adherents to the faith have passed this way yet so that she can tell them of the need for new custodians. She says she has sent messages with other travelers but has yet to hear word. In the meantime, she does her best to continue her duties here and maintain the temple until help arrives.": "索拉坎修女温顺、恭敬、乐于助人，是个不折不扣的好人。她尽力满足来访者的需求，如果他们想留下来，就带他们去客房（{@area 3|mlt3|u}）。她提供茶水，允许游客进入寺庙进行祈祷和冥想。如果受到挑衅，她不会破坏自己的行为；相反，面对任何针对她的敌意，她表现得很害怕，很可怜，如果有机会，她会逃到寺庙的安全地带。如果问她为什么独自在这里，她声称管理寺庙的神职人员一年多前去世了。作为一个如此偏远的地方，还没有其他信仰的信徒经过这里，所以她可以告诉他们需要新的监护人。她说，她已经和其他旅行者发出了信息，但还没有听到消息。与此同时，她尽力继续履行她在这里的职责，维护寺庙，直到帮助到来。",
	"Her typical ploy is to lull visitors into a false sense of security then prey on them at her leisure at night.

	"The temple grounds were once tasteful gardens, now wild with neglect. An artificial pond filled with pink lotuses sits just off the mountain pass. Carved stone steps lead up the slope, past the pond, and to the temple, an intricate building with several tall spires carved from the same granite ridge protruding from the slope. The exterior is a breathtaking display of intricate carvings showing divine servants doing battle with fiends, aiding those in need, and acting as messengers of the gods. These were once painted and highly detailed, but neglect has left the paint faded and peeled and, in some places, gone altogether.": "寺庙的场地曾经是有品位的花园，现在因疏忽而荒废。一个种满粉红色莲花的人工池塘就在山口边。雕刻的石阶通向山坡，经过池塘，到达寺庙，这是一座复杂的建筑，有几个高大的尖顶，由山坡上突出的同一花岗岩山脊雕刻而成。庙宇的外观是一个令人惊叹的复杂雕刻，展示了神的仆人与魔鬼作战，帮助那些需要帮助的人，以及作为神的使者。这些雕像曾经上过漆，而且非常精细，但由于疏忽，漆已经褪色和剥落，在某些地方已经完全消失。",
	"This pond is edged with rounded river rocks. The water's surface is nearly covered in leaves and blossoms. A willow tree stands near the pond's edge, its branches long enough to dip into and trail in the waters of the pond.": "这个池塘边上有圆形的河石。水面几乎被树叶和花朵所覆盖。一棵柳树矗立在池塘边上，它的枝条长到足以浸入池塘的水里，并在池塘的水里留下痕迹。",
	"This picturesque area appears calm and peaceful. Pink blossoms cover the water's surface, and the willow's boughs sway gently in the breeze.

	"A {@creature ghost} resides here, the last remnant of Sister Sorakan as a mortal. She lurks beneath the boughs of the weeping willow tree at the pond's edge. The terrible fate that befell her has unhinged her mind, and the ghost can't communicate in any rational manner. If the PCs ask about her death or what brought her to this state, she attempts to pantomime the hantu penanggal by tearing her head from her shoulders, raising it high in the air, and pointing up the path to the temple. Unfortunately, this action acts as the ghost's Horrifying Visage and affects the PCs accordingly.": "这里住着一个{@creature ghost}，是索拉坎修女作为凡人的最后遗留物。她潜伏在池塘边的垂柳树的枝桠下。发生在她身上的可怕的命运使她的思想混乱，鬼魂不能以任何理性的方式交流。如果NPC问起她的死因或者是什么让她变成这样，她就会试图通过把头从肩膀上扯下来，高高举起，并指向通往寺庙的道路，来模仿汉图潘安格的动作。不幸的是，这个动作就像鬼魂的恐怖面孔一样，对NPC产生了相应的影响。",
	"The only way to lay Sister Sorakan's spirit to rest is to destroy the hantu penanggal and the walled horror (see {@area 9|mlt9|u}), thus freeing the temple from the evil her terrible decisions wrought.": "让索拉肯修女的灵魂安息的唯一方法是摧毁hantu penanggal和有墙的恐怖（见{@area 9|mlt9|u}），从而将寺庙从她可怕的决定中解放出来。",

If commanded to do so by her, a zombie spends its action to tear off its own head, allowing the fiend's head to replace it.": "前两个摊位是空的。其余四个摊位各有两个{@creature zombie|mm|zombies}，总共有八个。这些生物听从汉图penanggal的命令，她有时会在战斗中调用它们来增加肌肉。然而，它们的主要目的是在汉图潘安格被摧毁时为其提供新的身体。如果被她命令这样做，僵尸会用它的行动来撕下自己的头，让恶魔的头来代替它。",

	"Stairs in this room lead up to the next level. Another set leads downward, then ends, jutting out into the dizzying space under the floating remains of the tower. A quartet of mirrors set in elaborate ebony frames stand in the center of the room. The mirrors all face inward toward a spot in the middle of the room.": "这个房间里的楼梯通向下一层。另一组楼梯向下延伸，然后结束，突出到浮动的塔楼残骸下的令人眩晕的空间。房间的中央摆放着四面镶嵌在精致的乌木镜框中的镜子。这些镜子都朝向房间中间的一个地方。",
	"A creature that enters the space between the mirrors and that is reflected in all four mirrors must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be trapped within the mirrors, its being fragmented between them.

	"The trapped creature can't be targeted by attacks and other effects outside the mirrors, but it is able to perceive the surroundings of the reflections in which its essence is trapped. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check while perceiving these surroundings notes that all reflections are identical, except for one. That particular reflection shows an ornate key of black iron, chased in silver, lying on the floor between the mirrors. Though the trapped creature's reflections are visible to those outside the mirrors, the key isn't. A successful DC 15 Dexterity or Intelligence check discerns the correct way the trapped creature must move to make that particular reflection pick up the key.

Should any of the PCs be visibly carrying the key or make him aware they are in possession of it, he offers them an ultimatum: if they give him the key, they can leave the towers with their lives. The PCs only have one chance to accept Caliryl's offer. Beyond that, Caliryl is merciless. He and his fey revenants fight to the death to protect the queen's prize. One of the other three revenants has the body of a spider, while the other two are wasp-bodied and can fly.": "目前有四个人（%0%）住在这里，包括他们的领袖卡里尔。这个身穿蝎子皮的复仇者已经找到了他的女王委托他采购的物品，但他对自己无法找到打开它的方法感到沮丧。如果任何一个NPC明显地携带钥匙，或者让他知道他们拥有钥匙，他就会向他们发出最后通牒：如果他们把钥匙给他，他们就可以带着他们的生命离开塔楼。NPC只有一次机会来接受Caliryl的提议。除此之外，卡利里尔是无情的。他和他的精灵复仇者们为了保护女王的战利品而战斗到死。另外三个复仇者中的一个拥有蜘蛛的身体，而另外两个则是黄蜂的身体，可以飞行。",
