	"The Scattered Isles is a collection of small uninhabited islands between Lustra and Dennmarsh. Merchant ships often navigate the waters between the two ferrying goods to and from both cities. The journey is usually peaceful, although occasionally pirates do harass ships that stray too far from the normal shipping lanes. The weather in the isles can be a tad unpredictable at times, and it's not unheard of for a ship to go missing every now and then. This is part of what drives the cost of goods between the two port cities and makes the route such a profitable one. Many merchant ships also act as passenger vessels, turning excess storage and crew space into bunks for adventurers looking for quick and cheap transport across the sea. The characters find themselves onboard one such ship, the {@i Sea Mephit}. It's currently in the heart of the Scattered Isles making its way to Lustra first followed by Valhenge to the far south. No pirates have been seen, but there's a hint of a storm brewing on the wind and things can take a bad turn rather quickly out here on the sea.": "散乱群岛是位于路斯特拉和丹玛什之间的一组无人居住的小岛。商船经常在这两个城市之间的水域航行，运送货物往返于这两个城市。这段旅程通常是和平的，尽管偶尔海盗会骚扰那些离正常航道太远的船只。群岛上的天气有时会有点难以预测，偶尔会有船只失踪，这也不是没有可能的。这也是推动两个港口城市之间货物成本的部分原因，并使这一路线如此有利可图。许多商船还充当客船，将多余的储藏室和船员空间变成铺位，供寻找快速和廉价的跨海运输的冒险家使用。人物发现自己就在这样一艘船上，即{@i Sea Mephit}号。这艘船目前在散乱群岛的中心地带，先是前往卢斯特拉，然后是远在南方的瓦伦格。没有看到海盗，但有一丝风暴在风中酝酿，在海上，事情可能很快就会变得糟糕。",

She speaks Aquan and common. She inquires as to what the party is doing so far out to sea on such a small ship. If they tell her about the shipwreck, she empathizes with them. The mermaid advises them to make an offering to the god of the sea. She says if anyone can help get them home faster, it is she who watches over the oceans. If they ask what a good offering would be, she recommends something beautiful. She says there is a temple beneath the waves she could take their offering to if they would like. If they give her the pearl, she disappears beneath the waves. Sometime later, a large wave appears on the horizon behind them. As it gets closer and closer, it suddenly turns into the shape of a hand. It grabs hold of the raft and pushes it forward across the water faster than any wind could have done. After what seems like hours, it finally slows, and the raft once again begins to lazily drift on.

	"As they look up, they see a small trading vessel just off their starboard. There is a man, face roughened by years at sea, hanging from the rigging.": "当他们抬头时，他们看到一艘小型贸易船就在他们的右舷。船上有一个人，由于常年在海上航行，脸部已经变得粗糙，正挂在缆绳上。",
	"\"Come aboard! We'll get ye fixed up!\"": "\"上船吧! 我们会把你们弄好的！\"",
	"The man is Darius Cornwall, a trader out of Valhenge. He and his crew help the party and Bozek aboard their ship, The Lucky Gambit. They explain that they are headed back to Valhenge from Lustra and that they all are welcome to ride along, although they will have to pull their own weight. They have no room for freeloaders, even ones found drifting at sea. They are about a week out of Valhenge, if the weather holds. The party will have to take on various duties such as cleaning, cooking, and ship maintenance to earn their way.": "这个人就是达利斯-康沃尔，一个来自瓦伦格的商人。他和他的船员帮助党和波塞克登上了他们的船 \"幸运赌注\"。他们解释说，他们正从鲁斯特拉（Lustra）返回瓦伦格，欢迎他们所有人一起乘坐，不过他们必须自力更生。他们没有空间给自由人，即使是在海上漂流时发现的自由人。如果天气好的话，他们离瓦伦格大约还有一个星期的路程。他们将不得不承担各种职责，如清洁、烹饪和船舶维修，以赚取他们的生活费。",
	"Six days have passed from the time the characters were rescued. On their 11th day at sea, they hear a massive roar. If they investigate the sound and go up to the main deck, they see a Kraken rising out of the water in the distance.": "从这些人物被救起，已经过去了六天。在他们在海上的第11天，他们听到了巨大的轰鸣声。如果他们调查这个声音，并上到主甲板，就会看到远处有一只克拉肯从水中升起。",
	"The captain immediately turns the ship hard to port. As he does, the beast begins to swim towards the ship. \"Man the ballistae! Try to slow it down!\" He shouts back to you. \"I'll try to lose it in the shallows!\"": "船长立即将船转向左舷。当他这样做时，那只野兽开始向船上游去。\"拿起炮弹! 试着让它慢下来！\" 他回头对你喊道。\"我会试着在浅滩上甩掉它！\"",
	"There are two ballistae on the elevated rear portion of the deck. They each fire steel tipped bolts that deal {@damage 4d10} piercing damage. The Kraken is immune to their damage, but the tips are soaked in oil and can be set alight to convert their damage type to fire. Anyone can operate them. To fire one, a party member rolls {@dice 1d20} + Dexterity modifier + 5. To load one, it takes a combined 30 strength.": "在甲板后部的高架上有两个弹炮。它们各自发射钢质弹头，造成{@damage 4d10}穿刺伤害。克拉肯对它们的伤害是免疫的，但弹头被浸泡在油中，可以被点燃以将其伤害类型转换为火。任何人都可以操作它们。要发射一个，一个党员要掷出{@dice 1d20}+灵巧修饰+5。",
	"The {@creature Kraken} is too far out to use most of its attacks, so it uses its lighting storm attack. On its initiative count, it targets a random character. Have them make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw taking {@damage 4d6} lightning damage on a fail and half as much on a success. They get advantage on the save due to the captain's deft piloting skills.": "{@creature Kraken}太远了，无法使用它的大部分攻击，所以它使用它的照明风暴攻击。在它的主动权数上，它的目标是一个随机的角色。让他们做一个DC15的灵巧救赎，如果失败则受到{@damage 4d6}的雷电伤害，成功则受到一半的伤害。由于舰长的驾驶技术很好，他们在救赎上有优势。",
	"Combat with the Kraken lasts 5 rounds. After that, the captain manages to pilot the ship into a series of high rocky islands just off the coast. As he slips in between two large formations, the Kraken slams into them, roaring with anger, before slinking back into the depths from whence it came.": "与克拉肯的战斗持续了5个回合。之后，船长设法将船驶入海岸边的一系列高大的岩石岛屿。当他滑入两个大阵地之间时，克拉肯撞上了它们，愤怒地咆哮着，然后溜回了它来时的深处。",
	"Alternatively, if the party has the tentacle idol and throws it into the ocean, ethereal tentacles sprout from the it and drag the monster back beneath the waves. Anyone who witnesses this permanently gains {@b Feature: Touched by the Far Realm}. Those affected must roll {@dice 1d20} whenever they sleep. If they roll a 1, they have dreams of an alien world full of monstrous and unknowable horrors. When they awake, they recover only half the normal amount of hit points they would from a long rest. As a positive, they gain advantage on any saves to resist having their mind read or influenced. A {@spell Remove Curse} spell can remove this feature.": "另外，如果一方拥有触手神像并将其扔进海里，空灵的触手就会从神像上长出，将怪物拖回海浪之下。任何目睹此事的人都会永久获得（%0%）。受影响的人在睡觉时必须掷出（%1%）。如果他们掷出1，他们就会梦见一个充满畸形和不可知的恐怖的异世界。当他们醒来时，他们只恢复了正常情况下长时间休息后的一半命中率。作为一个优点，他们在任何抵制读心术或影响的救赎中都获得优势。一个（2%）的法术可以消除这个特征。",
	"The captain pilots the ship through the rocky archipelago, careful to avoid the deep water. When the ship emerges from the rocks hours later, Valhenge can be seen off in the distance.": "船长驾驶着船穿过多岩石的群岛，小心地避开深水。几个小时后，当船从岩石中出现时，可以看到远处的瓦伦格。",
	"The captain hands the wheel over to his crew member and comes down to speak with you. \"You did good back there, but please don't be offended when I say this: stay on dry land, for everyone's sake.\" He pats you on the shoulder and heads down below deck, more than likely to get extremely drunk and try to forget this day.": "船长把方向盘交给了他的船员，然后下来和你说话。\"你在后面做得很好，但当我这样说时，请不要生气：为了大家的利益，呆在干地上。\" 他拍拍你的肩膀，然后下到甲板下面，更有可能喝得酩酊大醉，试图忘记这一天。",
	"With the ship safely sailing into harbor the characters can plan their next move. If they needed to head to Lustra for work, they'll need to secure new passage. Although the {@i Sea Mephit} is no more and Bozek is without a crew, he'll never forget what the characters did for him. If the encounter him in the future, he'll have a friendly disposition towards them and may assist them with whatever their current course of action is.": "随着船安全驶入港口，人物可以计划他们的下一步行动。如果他们需要前往卢斯特拉工作，他们就需要确保新的通道。虽然{@i Sea Mephit}号已经不复存在，Bozek也没有了船员，但他永远不会忘记这些人物为他所做的一切。如果他们在未来遇到他，他会对他们表现出友好的态度，并可能协助他们完成他们目前的行动方案。"
