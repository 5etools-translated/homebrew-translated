	"The Sword Coast is where the continent of Faerûn meets the Sea of Swords in the west. This coastline is populated by a wealth of different folk from the Savage Frontier in the north down to the nation of Amn in the south. The settlements on the coast and the Island Kingdoms of the Sea of Swords and Trackless Sea are the primary settings of this campaign, but other inland locations may feature more prominently during your playthrough. For additional information on these locations, consult the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}.": "剑海岸是法鲁恩大陆与西边的剑海的交汇处。这条海岸线上居住着大量不同的居民，从北部的野蛮人边境到南部的安恩国。海岸上的定居点以及剑海和无轨海的岛屿王国是这次战役的主要背景，但其他内陆地区在你的游戏过程中可能会有更突出的特点。关于这些地点的更多信息，请查阅{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}。",
	"The coastline itself is perilous and changeable. In the north is the Sea of Moving Ice, filled with great bergs that shatter the hulls of unwary ships. Further south lies calmer waters and friendly ports and cities, such as Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and Baldur's Gate. Despite the existence of these havens, Red Rocks isn't the only thing that will sink your vessel. Pirates from Luskan and The Northlander Isles roam the coast, targeting merchant galleys and bullying fishing boats. The seas too are cruel, harbouring hideous monsters, tempestuous squalls and unseen horrors in their depths.": "海岸线本身是危险的，多变的。北部是移动的冰海，充满了巨大的贝雷格，可以击碎不小心的船只的船体。再往南是平静的水域和友好的港口和城市，如永夜城、水底城和博德之门。尽管有这些避风港的存在，但红岩并不是唯一会让你的船只沉没的东西。来自卢斯坎（Luskan）和北地群岛（The Northlander Isles）的海盗在海岸上游荡，瞄准商船和欺负渔船。大海也是残酷的，在它的深处隐藏着可怕的怪物、狂暴的风暴和看不见的恐怖。",
	"Many strange forces have threatened the Sword Coast in recent years, from {@adventure marauding giants|skt} to a {@adventure death curse|toa}, the {@adventure Cult of Elemental Evil|pota} and {@adventure Tiamat|hotdq} herself. Brave heroes have managed to restore peace to the region each time, but this new threat may be the breaking point. Something distinctly alien has crash-landed in Faerûn. Something which the Material Plane is not equipped to deal with.": "近年来，许多奇怪的力量威胁着剑海岸，从{@adventure marauding giants|skt}到{@adventure death curse|toa}、{@adventure Cult of Elemental Evil|pota}和{@adventure Tiamat|hotdq}自己。勇敢的英雄们每次都设法恢复该地区的和平，但这个新的威胁可能是突破点。某种明显的外来事物已经坠落在法鲁恩。物质世界没有能力处理的东西。",
	"Entirely alien to most of the common folk of the Realms, the illithid, or mind flayers, formed an empire of psionic hive mind slavers who brought devastation to populations of sentient creatures. Over many centuries, and across innumerate worlds, these tentacled nightmares subjected thousands of races to psychic torture, breaking their will and turning them into thralls. Telepathically united, these aberrations traversed the Outer Planes in nautiloids, ships attuned to their needs, in search of races to enslave.": "对于大多数王国的普通人来说，illithid（或称 \"掠心者\"）是完全陌生的，他们形成了一个幻觉蜂巢式的奴隶帝国，给有生命的生物带来了毁灭性的打击。在许多个世纪里，在无数个世界里，这些长着触角的恶梦让成千上万的种族遭受精神折磨，摧毁他们的意志，把他们变成傀儡。在心灵感应的作用下，这些反常者乘坐鹦鹉螺号穿越外星球，这些船只根据他们的需要进行调整，寻找可以奴役的种族。",
	"One of these races were the gith. Although they were dominated for centuries by the illithid, somehow the gith revolted against their oppressors, overthrowing their empire and scattering the remaining mind flayers far and wide. Although the details of the uprising are unknown, the illithid and gith (who became two separate races, the githyanki and githzerai), still hold utter contempt for each other. The gith actively seek out Illithid to destroy, and mind flayers seek githyanki crèches on the Material Plane to subjugate and torture. For more information about the gith and illithid conflict, known as the Endless War, see {@book chapter 4 of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|mtf|3}.": "这些种族之一是吉斯人。虽然他们被illithid统治了几个世纪，但不知何故，gith反抗了他们的压迫者，推翻了他们的帝国，并将剩余的心灵传播者分散到很远的地方。虽然起义的细节不为人知，但伊里特人和吉斯人（成为两个独立的种族，即吉特扬基人和吉斯泽拉人），仍然对彼此抱有完全的蔑视。吉斯人积极地寻找伊利特人进行破坏，而心灵传播者则在物质界寻找吉特扬基人的摇篮来征服和折磨。关于吉斯人和伊利特人的冲突，即所谓的无尽战争的更多信息，请参阅（%0%）。",
	"In recent times, most surviving Illithid are scattered across the Astral Plane. A few made it to other worlds, where they continue to harvest brains and create thralls. Numerous sects of illithid have taken up home in the Underdark, the vast network of caverns beneath Faerûn. Here, hidden in the shadows, they devour the brains of sentient creatures to sustain themselves.": "近来，大多数幸存的伊里特人都散落在星界。少数人来到了其他世界，在那里他们继续收割大脑，创造王族。众多的伊利希德教派在暗黑世界安家落户，暗黑世界是法鲁恩地下的巨大洞穴网络。在这里，他们隐藏在阴影中，吞噬有生命的生物的大脑来维持自己的生命。",
	"Illithid culture is founded on knowledge and understanding. As well as consuming brains for sustenance, mind flayers also receive memories and wisdom stored within their victims' brains, which is immediately transmitted throughout their colony telepathically. At the head of these colonies are Elder Brains. These beings of supreme intelligence manage the illithid communities, accessing the information they hold and using it to further the will of the race. Their goals are known as The Grand Design, which focusses on rebuilding their lost empire, and subjugating their remaining enemies.": "伊利特人的文化是建立在知识和理解之上的。除了消耗大脑来维持生计外，掠夺者还接收储存在受害者大脑中的记忆和智慧，这些记忆和智慧会立即通过心灵感应传送到整个族群。这些群体的首领是长老脑。这些具有最高智慧的生物管理着伊利希德人的社区，获取他们所掌握的信息，并利用这些信息来推进种族的意志。他们的目标被称为 \"大设计\"，其重点是重建他们失去的帝国，并征服他们剩余的敌人。",
	"Zellix'Phor is an ancient elder brain, who remembers the destruction of the illithid empire. Through the absorption of dead illithid brains, Zellix'Phor came to know the causes of the empire's fall and is obsessed with vengeance. Driven by bloodlust, the illithid colony that follows Zellix'Phor searches across the Planes of Existence for githyanki crèches, hoping to decimate their population through infanticide.": "Zellix'Phor是一个古老的长者大脑，他记得illithid帝国的毁灭。通过吸收死去的illithid大脑，Zellix'Phor知道了帝国灭亡的原因，并沉迷于复仇。在嗜血的驱使下，跟随Zellix'Phor的illithid殖民地在整个存在平面上寻找githyanki托儿所，希望通过杀婴来减少其人口。",
	"Zellix'Phor had become a name that elated mind flayers and brought dread into the hearts of the gith. His devastating effect upon the githyanki population was well known, and horrifying stories were told within that culture of the silent and deadly arrival of the illithid vessel which housed Zellix'Phor and his disciples.": "Zellix'Phor已经成为了一个让思想解放者欢欣鼓舞的名字，并给吉斯人的内心带来了恐惧。他对吉斯人的破坏性影响是众所周知的，在这种文化中，关于容纳Zellix'Phor和他的弟子的illithid船只无声而致命的到来的可怕故事被讲述。",
	"Over time, the colony of Zellix'Phor grew to a point where it could barely sustain itself. All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix'Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix'Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.": "随着时间的推移，Zellix'Phor的殖民地发展到了几乎无法维持的程度。所有可用的鹦鹉螺空间都被献给了illithid，他们的傀儡也被抛弃，以便为这个优越的种族腾出空间。对大脑的需求，以助长思想转换器，这意味着殖民地所处的鹦鹉螺体越来越频繁地访问物质世界。尽管Zellix'Phor同化了几代人的战术战争知识，但他的傲慢成为了他的败笔。吉斯人一直在各星球上追踪鹦鹉螺，等待合适的时机进行攻击。Zellix'Phor认为自己是不可战胜的，他命令这艘船停靠在物质位面以储备大脑，结果这艘船遭到了攻击。",
	"Githyanki knights, the fiercest and most formidable warriors of the martial race, struck the nautiloid with immeasurable force. They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix'Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid. As far as the githyanki are concerned, the suicide mission was a success.": "吉提亚基骑士，这个武术种族中最凶猛、最可怕的战士，以不可估量的力量打击了鹦鹉螺。他们以刺客的身份进入船内，并消灭了里面的幻兽。没有了他们的王座来承担攻击的重任，心灵传播者就站在了前线，尽管他们有强大的幻觉能力，但许多人还是被Githyanki的银剑击倒了。鹦鹉螺号在北地人的贡达伦岛上坠落，几乎杀死了船上的所有人。不幸的是，Zellix'Phor和他最亲密的随从设法活了下来，在鹦鹉螺的长老脑室中躲过了破坏。就Githyanki而言，这次自杀任务是成功的。",
	"With an unimaginable intellect and iron will, Zellix'Phor is an Elder Brain whose like has not been seen on the Material Plane for centuries, if ever. Zellix'Phor is determined to rebuild the illithid empire around themselves and their colony, and also to exterminate the remaining gith. The elder brain is arrogant and believes themselves to be invincible, unable to be outsmarted or outmatched.": "Zellix'Phor拥有难以想象的智力和钢铁般的意志，他是一个长老级的大脑，在物质界已经有几个世纪没有见过这样的人了，如果有的话。Zellix'Phor决心围绕他们自己和他们的殖民地重建illithid帝国，同时也要灭掉剩余的吉斯人。长老的大脑很傲慢，认为自己是无敌的，无法被超越或击败。",
	"After the crash, Zellix'Phor felt fear for the first time. The gith had destroyed their colony, save for a handful of minor disciples and their attendants. Thankfully, Zellix'Phor's loyal acolytes put their lives on the line to find them a suitable vessel to occupy; the head of Slarkrethel the Kraken.": "坠机后，Zellix'Phor第一次感到恐惧。吉斯人摧毁了他们的殖民地，只剩下少数几个小弟子和他们的随从。值得庆幸的是，Zellix'Phor忠诚的信徒们冒着生命危险为他们找到了一个合适的容器；克拉肯的头颅。",
	"The ongoing psionic battle between the elder brain and the kraken has renewed Zellix'Phor's lust for domination, and the elder brain has sent out its agents into the Sword Coast to bring back the brains of its inhabitants, and the delicious knowledge contained within.": "长老会和克拉肯之间正在进行的幻觉之战重新激发了Zellix'Phor的统治欲望，长老会派出其代理人进入剑海岸，带回其居民的大脑，以及其中包含的美味知识。",
	"Being a powerful spellcaster and aspect of {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|scag}, Slarkrethel had a large following on the Sword Coast and throughout the Island Kingdoms in both the Kraken Society, and informal followers such as those on Purple Rocks. Now that Zellix'Phor is in control of the kraken, the elder brain has the ability to telepathically and psionically manipulate these agents to their will, and to further the Grand Design.": "作为一个强大的施法者和{@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|scag}的方面，斯拉克雷特尔在剑海岸和整个岛屿王国都有大量的追随者，无论是克拉肯协会，还是非正式的追随者，如紫岩上的那些人。现在，泽里克斯-普尔控制了克拉肯，长老的大脑有能力用心灵感应和幻术操纵这些代理人，以达到他们的目的，并推进大设计。",

	"Zellix'Phor was initially attended to by nine illithids. These mind flayers were tasked with uncovering specific areas of knowledge to help prolong the life and fulfil The Grand Design of Zellix'Phor. After the crash occurred, these nine helped Zellix'Phor escape from the crash site in what remained of their destroyed nautiloid - the elder brain chambers and control room.": "Zellix'Phor最初是由九个illithids照顾的。这些思想传播者的任务是发掘特定领域的知识，以帮助延长Zellix'Phor的生命并实现其大设计。坠机发生后，这九个人帮助Zellix'Phor从坠机地点逃出，他们乘坐的是被摧毁的鹦鹉螺号的残骸--长老脑室和控制室。",
	"After fleeing the island in the shattered remnants, the attendants ended up in the Trackless Sea. They were immediately noticed by Slarkrethel, the ancient, spellcasting kraken who rules over those waters. In a devastating battle, which claimed the lives of five of Zellix'Phor's attendants, Slarkrethel was subdued with psionic energy long enough for the elder brain to be grafted onto the kraken, dominating the brain of Slarkrethel.": "在乘着破碎的残骸逃离岛屿后，随从们最终来到了无轨海。他们立即被斯拉克雷特尔注意到了，他是统治这些水域的古老的、会施法的海怪。在一场毁灭性的战斗中，Zellix'Phor的五名随从丧生，斯拉克雷特尔被幻象能量制服了很久，长老的大脑被移植到克拉肯身上，支配着斯拉克雷特尔的大脑。",

	"The staff of the Moonstone Mask wear just that; a glowing, moonstone-trimmed masked and sheer black gowns that leave little to the imagination. The Mask no longer hires just women, but a healthy contingent of races and genders that should suit the desires of any individual. As well as their 'professional skills' the staff are skilled gamers and trusted confidants (thanks to their anonymity). The Mask is filled with live music at all hours, most often provided by Morana Aranore (LG female shield dwarf {@creature bard|vgm}).

She plays the twostring, a Tarnian instrument.": "月光石面具的工作人员就穿着这样的衣服；发光的、有月光石装饰的面具和透明的黑色长袍，几乎没有留下任何想象的空间。面具馆不再只雇用女性，而是一支健康的种族和性别的队伍，应该适合任何个人的愿望。除了他们的 \"专业技能 \"之外，工作人员还是熟练的游戏玩家和值得信赖的知己（由于他们的匿名性）。面具馆在任何时候都充满了现场音乐，最常见的是由莫拉娜-阿拉诺尔（LG女盾牌矮人（%0%））提供。莫拉娜在她的岁月里走过很多地方，从冈特格莱姆到永夜，再到海岛王国，再到回来。她会演奏双弦琴，一种塔尼安的乐器。",
	"As well as rich patrons, the Moonstone hosts highranking members of the Neverwinter Watch, including their commander General Sabine (LG female Chondathan human {@creature veteran} with 90 hit points). Sabine is in her fifties, is covered in scars from her battles, and is tough as nails. Despite hailing from Mintarn, Sabine is fiercely loyal to Neverember, so Liset keeps her comfortable in the Mask to please the Lord Protector.": "除了有钱的主顾，月光石还接待了永夜守望的高级成员，包括他们的指挥官萨宾将军（LG女性崇德坦人（%0%），命中率90）。萨宾已经50多岁了，身上布满了战斗留下的伤痕，而且身体强壮。尽管来自明塔恩，但萨宾对永夜城非常忠诚，所以利塞特让她在面具中保持舒适，以取悦保护者大人。",

	"This three-storey tavern is the recovered wreck of a pirate ship called Leviathan. The tavern is much-loved by locals of the Bluelake District and sailors along the Sword Coast alike. The tavern is owned by Harrag and his wife Andrella (LN male and female Chondathan human {@creature commoner|mm|commoners}). Harrag is a fat ex-pirate who claims fierce independence but is widely known to be an informant for Neverember. Andrella is prim and proper, and keeps a tight ship.": "这座三层楼高的酒馆是一艘名为 \"利维坦 \"的海盗船打捞出来的残骸。这家酒馆深受蓝湖区的当地人和剑海岸的水手们的喜爱。酒馆的主人是哈拉格和他的妻子安德烈拉（LN男性和女性琼丹人（%0%））。哈拉格是个胖胖的前海盗，他声称自己非常独立，但众所周知，他是纽恩堡的线人。安德烈拉是个很正直的人，而且保持着严格的管理。",

	"Over the past few years, Castle Never has seen a miraculous reconstruction. The structure was one of the worst affected in the cataclysm but has been thoroughly repaired and cleared of monsters by the Neverwinter Watch and adventuring parties.

Galt is a puppet of the Abolethic Sovereignty, a malicious organisation of aboleths from the Underdark whose aim is to corrupt Neverwinter.

Additionally, he leans on Loremaster Aelarthea to give the characters access to the Lower Vaults, and to send a pair of {@deity Oghma|Faerûnian|SCAG|Oghmanite} {@creature priest|mm|priests} with the characters to deal with Loremaster Atlavast.": "如果人物回到永夜城后得到了关于海盗袭击的原因--Aboleth主权的消息，他就会为他们配备六名{@creature guard|mm|guards}和两名{@creature veteran|mm|veterans}来自永夜守望的随行人员，帮助他们对付海盗和Aboleth。此外，他还求助于Aelarthea法师，让他们进入下层金库，并派一对{@deity Oghma|Faerûnian|SCAG|Oghmanite}{@creature priest|mm|priests}与他们一起去对付Atlavast法师。",
	"Obviously, any acknowledgement of the existence of the Sovereignty in Neverwinter makes Mayor Galt extremely uncomfortable. He suddenly becomes animated, vehemently denying the existence of the society, claiming it was wiped out decades ago by their rivals. If the characters have information proving that Galt is a member of the Sovereignty, Neverember calls for his execution.": "很明显，任何承认主权国家在永夜存在的行为都会让市长高尔特感到非常不舒服。他突然变得活跃起来，坚决否认这个社会的存在，声称它在几十年前就被他们的对手消灭了。如果人物有信息证明高尔特是主权国家的成员，永无止境会要求处决他。",
	"This immense temple to {@deity Oghma|Faerûnian|SCAG} stands proud as a monument to the New Neverwinter.

Aelarthea is an incredibly calm individual whose actions are slow and measured, at times infuriatingly so. They respond to most situations by looking it up in the enormous library, which means even simple queries sometimes take days to resolve. Unfortunately, Aelarthea cannot aid characters in search of divination.

Poor Atlavast was corrupted in the years that passed by an {@creature Kzixxaro|CallfromtheDeep|aboleth} named Kzixxaro, a member of the Abolethic Sovereignty working in Neverwinter.

The graveyard is sealed by a sturdy stone wall which makes it almost impenetrable.": "Neverdeath是一个巨大的墓地，位于保护者飞地的南部地区。它被分成两个区域，一个是贫民区，一个是贵族和商人区。如今，该墓地很少用于安葬死者。墓地里有太多的黑暗势力在作祟，所以在永夜里，人们更喜欢火葬。墓地被一堵坚固的石墙封住了，这使得它几乎无法穿越。",

	"This small tavern, once a grand wizard tower owned by Llomnauvel 'Firehands' Oloadhin, fell decades before the Spellplague. The remnants of the tower were reconstructed into this establishment sometime after but was devastated again during the Ruining. When the Many-Arrows orcs invaded Neverwinter they happened upon the tower and made it their lair.

	"The main draw of the tavern are the gory phantoms that appear each night. These illusions replay the last few moments of folk who lost their lives in the tower including falling to death, incineration, and transmutation experiments gone wrong. The tavern is owned by Vagdru One-Ear (CN male Many-Arrows {@creature orc}), one of the original Many-Arrows raiders. Vagru was a renowned warrior, but age is getting the better of him.

	"Characters who spend time in the Fallen Tower notice a ragged old orc sitting close to the fire with claws as long as knives and white tattoos covering her body. Occasionally one of the patrons, typically an orc or half-orc, brings her some food or drink and communes with her.

	"Characters that can speak {@language orc|phb|Orcish} and purchase food or drink for Shonka White-Eyes gain her favour. She casts a spell for them in return, including {@spell divination} as a ritual.

Using her claws, she sketches an image in the dirt; a ship with a skull over it, a blank scroll, a moon, a sun and a second moon, and finally a dragon's head.": "能够为香卡-白眼说话（%0%）并购买食物或饮料的角色会获得她的青睐。她为他们施法作为回报，包括（%1%）的仪式。如果人物用{@spell divination}询问海盗袭击的情况，香卡的眼睛会变成闪闪发光的白色，并开始颤抖。她用她的爪子在泥土中勾画出一个图像；一艘盖着骷髅头的船，一个空白的卷轴，一个月亮，一个太阳和第二个月亮，最后是一个龙的头。",
	"White-Eyes doesn't know how to interpret the drawings and is exhausted when finished.
