	"The Sword Coast is where the continent of Faerûn meets the Sea of Swords in the west. This coastline is populated by a wealth of different folk from the Savage Frontier in the north down to the nation of Amn in the south. The settlements on the coast and the Island Kingdoms of the Sea of Swords and Trackless Sea are the primary settings of this campaign, but other inland locations may feature more prominently during your playthrough. For additional information on these locations, consult the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}.": "剑海岸是法鲁恩大陆与西边的剑海的交汇处。这条海岸线上居住着大量不同的居民，从北部的野蛮人边境到南部的安恩国。海岸上的定居点以及剑海和无轨海的岛屿王国是这次战役的主要背景，但其他内陆地区在你的游戏过程中可能会有更突出的特点。关于这些地点的更多信息，请查阅{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}。",
	"The coastline itself is perilous and changeable. In the north is the Sea of Moving Ice, filled with great bergs that shatter the hulls of unwary ships. Further south lies calmer waters and friendly ports and cities, such as Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and Baldur's Gate. Despite the existence of these havens, Red Rocks isn't the only thing that will sink your vessel. Pirates from Luskan and The Northlander Isles roam the coast, targeting merchant galleys and bullying fishing boats. The seas too are cruel, harbouring hideous monsters, tempestuous squalls and unseen horrors in their depths.": "海岸线本身是危险的，多变的。北部是移动的冰海，充满了巨大的贝雷格，可以击碎不小心的船只的船体。再往南是平静的水域和友好的港口和城市，如永夜城、水底城和博德之门。尽管有这些避风港的存在，但红岩并不是唯一会让你的船只沉没的东西。来自卢斯坎（Luskan）和北地群岛（The Northlander Isles）的海盗在海岸上游荡，瞄准商船和欺负渔船。大海也是残酷的，在它的深处隐藏着可怕的怪物、狂暴的风暴和看不见的恐怖。",
	"Many strange forces have threatened the Sword Coast in recent years, from {@adventure marauding giants|skt} to a {@adventure death curse|toa}, the {@adventure Cult of Elemental Evil|pota} and {@adventure Tiamat|hotdq} herself. Brave heroes have managed to restore peace to the region each time, but this new threat may be the breaking point. Something distinctly alien has crash-landed in Faerûn. Something which the Material Plane is not equipped to deal with.": "近年来，许多奇怪的力量威胁着剑海岸，从{@adventure marauding giants|skt}到{@adventure death curse|toa}、{@adventure Cult of Elemental Evil|pota}和{@adventure Tiamat|hotdq}自己。勇敢的英雄们每次都设法恢复该地区的和平，但这个新的威胁可能是突破点。某种明显的外来事物已经坠落在法鲁恩。物质世界没有能力处理的东西。",
	"Entirely alien to most of the common folk of the Realms, the illithid, or mind flayers, formed an empire of psionic hive mind slavers who brought devastation to populations of sentient creatures. Over many centuries, and across innumerate worlds, these tentacled nightmares subjected thousands of races to psychic torture, breaking their will and turning them into thralls. Telepathically united, these aberrations traversed the Outer Planes in nautiloids, ships attuned to their needs, in search of races to enslave.": "对于大多数王国的普通人来说，illithid（或称 \"掠心者\"）是完全陌生的，他们形成了一个幻觉蜂巢式的奴隶帝国，给有生命的生物带来了毁灭性的打击。在许多个世纪里，在无数个世界里，这些长着触角的恶梦让成千上万的种族遭受精神折磨，摧毁他们的意志，把他们变成傀儡。在心灵感应的作用下，这些反常者乘坐鹦鹉螺号穿越外星球，这些船只根据他们的需要进行调整，寻找可以奴役的种族。",
	"One of these races were the gith. Although they were dominated for centuries by the illithid, somehow the gith revolted against their oppressors, overthrowing their empire and scattering the remaining mind flayers far and wide. Although the details of the uprising are unknown, the illithid and gith (who became two separate races, the githyanki and githzerai), still hold utter contempt for each other. The gith actively seek out Illithid to destroy, and mind flayers seek githyanki crèches on the Material Plane to subjugate and torture. For more information about the gith and illithid conflict, known as the Endless War, see {@book chapter 4 of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|mtf|3}.": "这些种族之一是吉斯人。虽然他们被illithid统治了几个世纪，但不知何故，gith反抗了他们的压迫者，推翻了他们的帝国，并将剩余的心灵传播者分散到很远的地方。虽然起义的细节不为人知，但伊里特人和吉斯人（成为两个独立的种族，即吉特扬基人和吉斯泽拉人），仍然对彼此抱有完全的蔑视。吉斯人积极地寻找伊利特人进行破坏，而心灵传播者则在物质界寻找吉特扬基人的摇篮来征服和折磨。关于吉斯人和伊利特人的冲突，即所谓的无尽战争的更多信息，请参阅（%0%）。",
	"In recent times, most surviving Illithid are scattered across the Astral Plane. A few made it to other worlds, where they continue to harvest brains and create thralls. Numerous sects of illithid have taken up home in the Underdark, the vast network of caverns beneath Faerûn. Here, hidden in the shadows, they devour the brains of sentient creatures to sustain themselves.": "近来，大多数幸存的伊里特人都散落在星界。少数人来到了其他世界，在那里他们继续收割大脑，创造王族。众多的伊利希德教派在暗黑世界安家落户，暗黑世界是法鲁恩地下的巨大洞穴网络。在这里，他们隐藏在阴影中，吞噬有生命的生物的大脑来维持自己的生命。",
	"Illithid culture is founded on knowledge and understanding. As well as consuming brains for sustenance, mind flayers also receive memories and wisdom stored within their victims' brains, which is immediately transmitted throughout their colony telepathically. At the head of these colonies are Elder Brains. These beings of supreme intelligence manage the illithid communities, accessing the information they hold and using it to further the will of the race. Their goals are known as The Grand Design, which focusses on rebuilding their lost empire, and subjugating their remaining enemies.": "伊利特人的文化是建立在知识和理解之上的。除了消耗大脑来维持生计外，掠夺者还接收储存在受害者大脑中的记忆和智慧，这些记忆和智慧会立即通过心灵感应传送到整个族群。这些群体的首领是长老脑。这些具有最高智慧的生物管理着伊利希德人的社区，获取他们所掌握的信息，并利用这些信息来推进种族的意志。他们的目标被称为 \"大设计\"，其重点是重建他们失去的帝国，并征服他们剩余的敌人。",
	"Zellix'Phor is an ancient elder brain, who remembers the destruction of the illithid empire. Through the absorption of dead illithid brains, Zellix'Phor came to know the causes of the empire's fall and is obsessed with vengeance. Driven by bloodlust, the illithid colony that follows Zellix'Phor searches across the Planes of Existence for githyanki crèches, hoping to decimate their population through infanticide.": "Zellix'Phor是一个古老的长者大脑，他记得illithid帝国的毁灭。通过吸收死去的illithid大脑，Zellix'Phor知道了帝国灭亡的原因，并沉迷于复仇。在嗜血的驱使下，跟随Zellix'Phor的illithid殖民地在整个存在平面上寻找githyanki托儿所，希望通过杀婴来减少其人口。",
	"Zellix'Phor had become a name that elated mind flayers and brought dread into the hearts of the gith. His devastating effect upon the githyanki population was well known, and horrifying stories were told within that culture of the silent and deadly arrival of the illithid vessel which housed Zellix'Phor and his disciples.": "Zellix'Phor已经成为了一个让思想解放者欢欣鼓舞的名字，并给吉斯人的内心带来了恐惧。他对吉斯人的破坏性影响是众所周知的，在这种文化中，关于容纳Zellix'Phor和他的弟子的illithid船只无声而致命的到来的可怕故事被讲述。",
	"Over time, the colony of Zellix'Phor grew to a point where it could barely sustain itself. All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix'Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix'Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.": "随着时间的推移，Zellix'Phor的殖民地发展到了几乎无法维持的程度。所有可用的鹦鹉螺空间都被献给了illithid，他们的傀儡也被抛弃，以便为这个优越的种族腾出空间。对大脑的需求，以助长思想转换器，这意味着殖民地所处的鹦鹉螺体越来越频繁地访问物质世界。尽管Zellix'Phor同化了几代人的战术战争知识，但他的傲慢成为了他的败笔。吉斯人一直在各星球上追踪鹦鹉螺，等待合适的时机进行攻击。Zellix'Phor认为自己是不可战胜的，他命令这艘船停靠在物质位面以储备大脑，结果这艘船遭到了攻击。",
	"Githyanki knights, the fiercest and most formidable warriors of the martial race, struck the nautiloid with immeasurable force. They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix'Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid. As far as the githyanki are concerned, the suicide mission was a success.": "吉提亚基骑士，这个武术种族中最凶猛、最可怕的战士，以不可估量的力量打击了鹦鹉螺。他们以刺客的身份进入船内，并消灭了里面的幻兽。没有了他们的王座来承担攻击的重任，心灵传播者就站在了前线，尽管他们有强大的幻觉能力，但许多人还是被Githyanki的银剑击倒了。鹦鹉螺号在北地人的贡达伦岛上坠落，几乎杀死了船上的所有人。不幸的是，Zellix'Phor和他最亲密的随从设法活了下来，在鹦鹉螺的长老脑室中躲过了破坏。就Githyanki而言，这次自杀任务是成功的。",
	"With an unimaginable intellect and iron will, Zellix'Phor is an Elder Brain whose like has not been seen on the Material Plane for centuries, if ever. Zellix'Phor is determined to rebuild the illithid empire around themselves and their colony, and also to exterminate the remaining gith. The elder brain is arrogant and believes themselves to be invincible, unable to be outsmarted or outmatched.": "Zellix'Phor拥有难以想象的智力和钢铁般的意志，他是一个长老级的大脑，在物质界已经有几个世纪没有见过这样的人了，如果有的话。Zellix'Phor决心围绕他们自己和他们的殖民地重建illithid帝国，同时也要灭掉剩余的吉斯人。长老的大脑很傲慢，认为自己是无敌的，无法被超越或击败。",
	"After the crash, Zellix'Phor felt fear for the first time. The gith had destroyed their colony, save for a handful of minor disciples and their attendants. Thankfully, Zellix'Phor's loyal acolytes put their lives on the line to find them a suitable vessel to occupy; the head of Slarkrethel the Kraken.": "坠机后，Zellix'Phor第一次感到恐惧。吉斯人摧毁了他们的殖民地，只剩下少数几个小弟子和他们的随从。值得庆幸的是，Zellix'Phor忠诚的信徒们冒着生命危险为他们找到了一个合适的容器；克拉肯的头颅。",
	"The ongoing psionic battle between the elder brain and the kraken has renewed Zellix'Phor's lust for domination, and the elder brain has sent out its agents into the Sword Coast to bring back the brains of its inhabitants, and the delicious knowledge contained within.": "长老会和克拉肯之间正在进行的幻觉之战重新激发了Zellix'Phor的统治欲望，长老会派出其代理人进入剑海岸，带回其居民的大脑，以及其中包含的美味知识。",
	"Being a powerful spellcaster and aspect of {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|scag}, Slarkrethel had a large following on the Sword Coast and throughout the Island Kingdoms in both the Kraken Society, and informal followers such as those on Purple Rocks. Now that Zellix'Phor is in control of the kraken, the elder brain has the ability to telepathically and psionically manipulate these agents to their will, and to further the Grand Design.": "作为一个强大的施法者和{@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|scag}的方面，斯拉克雷特尔在剑海岸和整个岛屿王国都有大量的追随者，无论是克拉肯协会，还是非正式的追随者，如紫岩上的那些人。现在，泽里克斯-普尔控制了克拉肯，长老的大脑有能力用心灵感应和幻术操纵这些代理人，以达到他们的目的，并推进大设计。",

	"Zellix'Phor was initially attended to by nine illithids. These mind flayers were tasked with uncovering specific areas of knowledge to help prolong the life and fulfil The Grand Design of Zellix'Phor. After the crash occurred, these nine helped Zellix'Phor escape from the crash site in what remained of their destroyed nautiloid - the elder brain chambers and control room.": "Zellix'Phor最初是由九个illithids照顾的。这些思想传播者的任务是发掘特定领域的知识，以帮助延长Zellix'Phor的生命并实现其大设计。坠机发生后，这九个人帮助Zellix'Phor从坠机地点逃出，他们乘坐的是被摧毁的鹦鹉螺号的残骸--长老脑室和控制室。",
	"After fleeing the island in the shattered remnants, the attendants ended up in the Trackless Sea. They were immediately noticed by Slarkrethel, the ancient, spellcasting kraken who rules over those waters. In a devastating battle, which claimed the lives of five of Zellix'Phor's attendants, Slarkrethel was subdued with psionic energy long enough for the elder brain to be grafted onto the kraken, dominating the brain of Slarkrethel.": "在乘着破碎的残骸逃离岛屿后，随从们最终来到了无轨海。他们立即被斯拉克雷特尔注意到了，他是统治这些水域的古老的、会施法的海怪。在一场毁灭性的战斗中，Zellix'Phor的五名随从丧生，斯拉克雷特尔被幻象能量制服了很久，长老的大脑被移植到克拉肯身上，支配着斯拉克雷特尔的大脑。",

	"The staff of the Moonstone Mask wear just that; a glowing, moonstone-trimmed masked and sheer black gowns that leave little to the imagination. The Mask no longer hires just women, but a healthy contingent of races and genders that should suit the desires of any individual. As well as their 'professional skills' the staff are skilled gamers and trusted confidants (thanks to their anonymity). The Mask is filled with live music at all hours, most often provided by Morana Aranore (LG female shield dwarf {@creature bard|vgm}).

She plays the twostring, a Tarnian instrument.": "月光石面具的工作人员就穿着这样的衣服；发光的、有月光石装饰的面具和透明的黑色长袍，几乎没有留下任何想象的空间。面具馆不再只雇用女性，而是一支健康的种族和性别的队伍，应该适合任何个人的愿望。除了他们的 \"专业技能 \"之外，工作人员还是熟练的游戏玩家和值得信赖的知己（由于他们的匿名性）。面具馆在任何时候都充满了现场音乐，最常见的是由莫拉娜-阿拉诺尔（LG女盾牌矮人（%0%））提供。莫拉娜在她的岁月里走过很多地方，从冈特格莱姆到永夜，再到海岛王国，再到回来。她会演奏双弦琴，一种塔尼安的乐器。",
	"As well as rich patrons, the Moonstone hosts highranking members of the Neverwinter Watch, including their commander General Sabine (LG female Chondathan human {@creature veteran} with 90 hit points). Sabine is in her fifties, is covered in scars from her battles, and is tough as nails. Despite hailing from Mintarn, Sabine is fiercely loyal to Neverember, so Liset keeps her comfortable in the Mask to please the Lord Protector.": "除了有钱的主顾，月光石还接待了永夜守望的高级成员，包括他们的指挥官萨宾将军（LG女性崇德坦人（%0%），命中率90）。萨宾已经50多岁了，身上布满了战斗留下的伤痕，而且身体强壮。尽管来自明塔恩，但萨宾对永夜城非常忠诚，所以利塞特让她在面具中保持舒适，以取悦保护者大人。",

	"This three-storey tavern is the recovered wreck of a pirate ship called Leviathan. The tavern is much-loved by locals of the Bluelake District and sailors along the Sword Coast alike. The tavern is owned by Harrag and his wife Andrella (LN male and female Chondathan human {@creature commoner|mm|commoners}). Harrag is a fat ex-pirate who claims fierce independence but is widely known to be an informant for Neverember. Andrella is prim and proper, and keeps a tight ship.": "这座三层楼高的酒馆是一艘名为 \"利维坦 \"的海盗船打捞出来的残骸。这家酒馆深受蓝湖区的当地人和剑海岸的水手们的喜爱。酒馆的主人是哈拉格和他的妻子安德烈拉（LN男性和女性琼丹人（%0%））。哈拉格是个胖胖的前海盗，他声称自己非常独立，但众所周知，他是纽恩堡的线人。安德烈拉是个很正直的人，而且保持着严格的管理。",

	"Over the past few years, Castle Never has seen a miraculous reconstruction. The structure was one of the worst affected in the cataclysm but has been thoroughly repaired and cleared of monsters by the Neverwinter Watch and adventuring parties.

Galt is a puppet of the Abolethic Sovereignty, a malicious organisation of aboleths from the Underdark whose aim is to corrupt Neverwinter.

Additionally, he leans on Loremaster Aelarthea to give the characters access to the Lower Vaults, and to send a pair of {@deity Oghma|Faerûnian|SCAG|Oghmanite} {@creature priest|mm|priests} with the characters to deal with Loremaster Atlavast.": "如果人物回到永夜城后得到了关于海盗袭击的原因--Aboleth主权的消息，他就会为他们配备六名{@creature guard|mm|guards}和两名{@creature veteran|mm|veterans}来自永夜守望的随行人员，帮助他们对付海盗和Aboleth。此外，他还求助于Aelarthea法师，让他们进入下层金库，并派一对{@deity Oghma|Faerûnian|SCAG|Oghmanite}{@creature priest|mm|priests}与他们一起去对付Atlavast法师。",
	"Obviously, any acknowledgement of the existence of the Sovereignty in Neverwinter makes Mayor Galt extremely uncomfortable. He suddenly becomes animated, vehemently denying the existence of the society, claiming it was wiped out decades ago by their rivals. If the characters have information proving that Galt is a member of the Sovereignty, Neverember calls for his execution.": "很明显，任何承认主权国家在永夜存在的行为都会让市长高尔特感到非常不舒服。他突然变得活跃起来，坚决否认这个社会的存在，声称它在几十年前就被他们的对手消灭了。如果人物有信息证明高尔特是主权国家的成员，永无止境会要求处决他。",
	"This immense temple to {@deity Oghma|Faerûnian|SCAG} stands proud as a monument to the New Neverwinter.

Aelarthea is an incredibly calm individual whose actions are slow and measured, at times infuriatingly so. They respond to most situations by looking it up in the enormous library, which means even simple queries sometimes take days to resolve. Unfortunately, Aelarthea cannot aid characters in search of divination.

Poor Atlavast was corrupted in the years that passed by an {@creature Kzixxaro|CallfromtheDeep|aboleth} named Kzixxaro, a member of the Abolethic Sovereignty working in Neverwinter.

Laeral gives the characters a Lord's Alliance emblem, which they can present to the High Captains to gain an audience.": "在奖励了他们之后，拉伊尔要求这些人物去拜访卢斯坎。她认为风帆之城必须知道更多关于海盗活动增加的情况。Laeral给了人物一个主联盟的徽章，他们可以把这个徽章送给高级船长，以获得接见。",
	"After travelling to Luskan the characters can arrange a meeting with the five High Captains provided they show the Lord's Alliance emblem. Ship Suljack, under the command of Captain Dagmaer, is responsible for the control of piracy and claims to have no part in the attack on Waterdeep, spitting at the thought they'd associate with sea devils in such a lowly way. Luskan too has noticed increased piracy in the Sea of Swords that they are not a part of. They fear that the sahuagin and petty pirates are being manipulated by some greater force. Ship Suljack suggests that the characters head to the Nelanther Isles, a stronghold of piracy in the south. Here, they might be able to discover who, or what, is leading the attacks.": "在前往卢斯坎后，人物可以安排与五位高级船长会面，只要他们出示主联盟的徽章。由达格玛尔船长指挥的苏尔杰克号负责控制海盗行为，并声称没有参与对沃特德普的攻击，对他们以如此卑微的方式与海魔交往的想法表示唾弃。卢斯坎也注意到剑海的海盗活动增多，而他们并没有参与其中。他们担心萨瓦金人和小海盗们被某种更大的力量所操纵。苏杰克船建议这些人物前往南部的海盗据点--内兰瑟群岛。在这里，他们可能会发现是谁，或者是什么，在领导这些攻击。",
	"After the sahuagin attempt to retrieve the {@item marid conch|CallfromtheDeep} from {@area Umberlee's Cache|wd3|x}, Dread High Trident Abeline Nerovarco realises something must be manipulating her telepathic communications with Slarkrethel. The kraken has never associated with sea devils in the past, and Abeline doesn't understand why he would send a whole fleet to Waterdeep when she could have taken the conch to him herself. Abeline tries not to reveal the identity of the Kraken Society's leader but divulges the information if the characters won't help her otherwise.": "在萨瓦金人试图从{@area Umberlee's Cache|wd3|x}那里取回{@item marid conch|CallfromtheDeep}后，可怕的高阶三叉戟阿贝琳-内罗瓦科意识到一定有什么东西在操纵她与斯拉克雷特尔的心灵感应。海怪过去从未与海魔发生过联系，阿贝琳不明白为什么他要派整个舰队去水底世界，而她可以亲自把海螺送到他那里。艾伯林尽量不透露海妖协会领导人的身份，但如果人物不愿意帮助她的话，就会泄露信息。",
	"Abeline asks the characters to escort her to the Cloakwood, just south of Baldur's Gate. She knows of a cavern hideout where the wood meets the cliffs where important members of the Kraken Society meet. If she can attend a meeting with other members, she might be able to understand what's going on. She also asks if the characters wish to join the society. She cannot permit her secret to be spread throughout Waterdeep, and the cult promises great power and knowledge to its members. Characters who join are given a {@item breastplate|phb} embossed with a kraken design.": "艾伯林要求角色们护送她到斗篷森林，就在博德之门的南部。她知道在树林与悬崖相接的地方有一个洞穴藏身处，克拉肯协会的重要成员在那里聚会。如果她能和其他成员一起参加会议，她也许能了解发生了什么。她还询问人物是否愿意加入该协会。她不允许自己的秘密在整个沃特迪普（Waterdeep）传播，而且这个邪教组织承诺为其成员提供巨大的力量和知识。加入的角色会得到一个压印有海怪图案的（%0%）。",

The cliff is 150 feet tall and requires a successful DC 18 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A character who fails the check must determine at what height they begin to slip, roll a {@dice d10} and multiply the result by 10. The character must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, catching themselves on a success. On a failed save the character falls the remaining distance to the rocky cove, taking {@dice #$prompt_number:min=1,title=Enter a number of dice to roll,default=1$#d6|1d6} bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen. Abeline knows a secret stair which can be used to descend safely.": "当人物到达时，他们意识到为什么这个地方有它的名字。通过陆地进入这里需要从悬崖上爬下来，非常危险。悬崖有150英尺高，需要成功进行DC18力量（（%0%））检查。未能通过检定的角色必须确定他们在什么高度开始滑落，掷出{@dice d10}，然后将结果乘以10。该角色必须做一个DC18的灵巧救赎，如果成功就能抓住自己。如果救赎失败，角色将跌落到岩石海湾的剩余距离，每跌落10英尺受到{@dice #$prompt_number:min=1,title=Enter a number of dice to roll,default=1$#d6|1d6}重击伤害。艾伯林知道一个秘密的楼梯，可以用来安全下降。",
	"When characters arrive in the cavern at Breakhand Cove, they can meet with Kraken Society members if they joined the cult; those who refused must remain behind.

	"Any suggestion that anything is wrong is met with jeers from the other members and curiosity from the deep scions. Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom ({@skill Persuasion}) check can get the scions to reveal that Purple Rocks is undergoing a change. The fish stocks are running low, so more and more sacrifices are being made to Slarkrethel. His organisation of attacks on the Sword Coast must surely be signs of his pleasure. If the characters search the possessions of the scions (by stealing them or killing the scions first) they discover letters from Sea King Tentrix.": "任何认为有问题的建议都会遭到其他成员的嘲笑和深层子弟的好奇。通过DC18智慧（（%0%））检查成功的角色可以让子孙们透露紫岩城正在经历一场变革。鱼类资源越来越少，所以越来越多的人向斯拉克雷特尔做出牺牲。他组织对剑海岸的攻击肯定是他高兴的迹象。如果角色们搜查子孙的财产（通过偷窃或先杀死子孙），他们会发现海王坦特利克斯的信件。",
	"Uth'ivellios Cithrea, leader of the sea elves, approaches the characters. Uth'ivellios is certain that there must be a malenti within their ranks.

In the seas to the south, pirates of many races and predilections sail from the Nelanther Isles, preying on trade running north and south along the coast. Further to the north are the islands of Gundarlun, The Purple Rocks, and Tuern. Gundarlun is the only island member of the Lords' Alliance and boasts a powerful navy called the Kingsfleet which is busy defending the coast from pirates. Tuern is a violent place of tribal warfare and raiding, like many other Northlander isles. The Purple Rocks, a gathering of small islands ruled by native kings, pays homage to the kraken Slarkrethel. Their lives are defined by their worship of King of the Trackless Depths.": "靠近法鲁恩的地方有鲸骨（Whalebones）和鲁阿西姆（Ruathym），那是伊鲁斯坎人祖先的古老家园，还有月海（Moonshaes），现在许多同族人与弗福克人和一个被称为勒维尔（Llewyr）的精灵分支共享岛屿。明塔恩（Mintarn）的自由港就在附近，它是敌人之间会面的中立地点，也是为水手提供大量工作的招募点。尽管面积不大，小小的奥伦博尔岛却拥有险恶的港口和技术精湛、需求旺盛的船工，是一个独立而有影响力的国家。在南边的海域，许多种族和偏好的海盗从尼兰特群岛出发，掠夺沿海岸南北的贸易。再往北是贡达伦岛、紫岩岛和图恩岛。贡达伦是领主联盟的唯一岛屿成员，拥有一支名为 \"国王舰队 \"的强大海军，正忙于保卫海岸免受海盗侵扰。图恩是一个充满部落战争和掠夺的暴力之地，就像许多其他北地人岛屿一样。紫岩岛是一个由本地国王统治的小岛聚集地，向海怪斯拉克雷特尔致敬。他们的生活被他们对无轨深渊之王的崇拜所定义。",
	"Humans are the most widespread of the civilised races, but no unified human nation exists on the Sword Coast, only individual cities, towns, villages, fiefdoms, farmsteads, fortresses, and outposts connected to one another by long, mostly unprotected rivers and roads. Human settlements rely on various industries for survival including fishing, mining, and farming. Coastal cities are home to human traders, shipbuilders, and artisans.": "人类是最广泛的文明种族，但在剑海岸没有统一的人类国家，只有个别的城市、城镇、村庄、封地、农庄、堡垒和前哨，通过长长的、大多没有保护的河流和道路相互连接。人类定居点依靠各种行业生存，包括捕鱼、采矿和耕种。沿海城市是人类商人、造船者和工匠的家园。",
	"Although each city of the Sword Coast enjoys and maintains its independence, all these communities are at risk of being overrun by the monstrous threats that live outside their walls. Fear of the wilderness and its many terrors led to the formation of the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederacy of human-dominated settlements built on mutually beneficial trade agreements and a willingness to seek out and destroy threats to civilization. Members of the Lords' Alliance include the cities of Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, and the island of Gundbarg.": "虽然剑海岸的每个城市都享有并保持着自己的独立性，但所有这些社区都面临着被生活在墙外的可怕威胁所淹没的风险。对荒野及其众多恐怖的恐惧导致了领主联盟的形成，这是一个由人类主导的定居点组成的松散联盟，建立在互利的贸易协议上，并愿意寻找和摧毁对文明的威胁。领主联盟的成员包括水底城、永夜城、博德之门和冈德巴格岛等城市。",
	"Within the settlements of the Sword Coast one can find humans, dwarves, elves, and other civilised races commingling more or less peacefully. Waterdeep, in particular, is a melting pot of races from all over Faerûn. Outside of these communities, however, people have much less tolerance for other races, as folk tend to feel safer among their own kind. Small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few, if any, non-humans, with most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferring to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands. In generations past, most human settlers of the Island Kingdoms were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the islands have attracted folk from other regions, and several generations of cultural mingling has given the humans of Faerûn much greater diversity in their appearance (see \"{@footnote {@race human|phb|Human Names and Ethnicities}|See the {@i Info} tab of the {@race human} race.}\" in chapter 2 of the {@i Player's Handbook}).": "在剑海岸的定居点，人们可以发现人类、矮人、精灵和其他文明种族或多或少地和平共处。特别是水底城，是来自法鲁恩各地种族的大熔炉。然而，在这些社区之外，人们对其他种族的容忍度要低得多，因为人们倾向于在自己的同类中感到更安全。由人类主导的小城镇和村庄往往很少有非人类，如果有的话，大多数矮人、精灵和半身人喜欢住在自己的定居点，远离人类的土地。在过去的几代人中，岛屿王国的大多数人类定居者都是白发和浅色皮肤。从那时起，岛屿的财富和前景吸引了来自其他地区的人们，几代人的文化交融使法鲁恩的人类在外表上有了更大的多样性（见《{@footnote {@race human|phb|Human Names and Ethnicities}|见{@i Info}标签的{@race human}种族.}》第二章的{@i Player's Handbook}）。",
	"The terms Northlander, Norls, Northfolk, and Northmen are interchangeable. They refer to one of several tall, fairhaired, seagoing peoples that ply the cold northern waters and dwell on the islands of the west including Tuern, Gundarlun, Ruathym, the Purple Rocks, and the Korinn Archipelago. Northfolk ancestors built small villages along the Sword Coast that have since become cities, including fabled Illusk (now Luskan), Eigersstor (now Neverwinter), and Nimoar's Hold (now Waterdeep). These early Northlanders farmed the rocky coastlines, fished coastal waters, and hunted seals and whales on the open sea.": "北方人、Norls、Northfolk和Northmen这些词可以互换。他们指的是几个高大、白发的航海民族之一，他们在寒冷的北方水域航行，居住在西部的岛屿上，包括图恩、贡达伦、鲁亚西姆、紫岩和科林群岛。诺斯福克人的祖先在剑海岸建立了一些小村庄，这些村庄后来都变成了城市，包括传说中的伊鲁斯克（现在的卢斯坎）、艾格斯托尔（现在的永冬）和尼莫尔之城（现在的水底）。这些早期的北地人在岩石海岸线上耕种，在沿海水域捕鱼，并在公海上猎取海豹和鲸鱼。",
	"Although Northlanders are often called barbarians, not all of them fit this description. Along the Sword Coast, some tribes have become fairly civilised, primarily due to the growth of the coastal cities and the increasing influence of outsiders. These people farm, fish, and mine their rugged lands, then shrewdly trade their goods with foreign buyers. Many once-feared tribes have become merchants whose bartering skills are equal to or better than the warlike talents of their ancestors, such that many a Northlander merchant earns more booty than their raiding neighbours. In many cases, however, the Northlanders of the Island Kingdoms still uphold the raiding and reaving culture of their past. Longships filled with berserkers loyal to one king set out over the waves to find new islands to plunder. Those who return with the finest goods and the biggest scars tend to become the next kings.": "虽然北地人经常被称为野蛮人，但并非所有的人都符合这一描述。沿着剑海岸，一些部落已经变得相当文明，主要是由于沿海城市的发展和外来人的影响越来越大。这些人在他们崎岖的土地上耕种、捕鱼和采矿，然后精明地与外国买家交易他们的货物。许多曾经害怕的部落已经成为商人，他们的易货贸易技能与他们祖先的好战才能相当，甚至更好，因此许多北地人商人赚取的战利品比他们的突袭邻居更多。然而，在许多情况下，岛屿王国的北地人仍然坚持他们过去的袭击和掠夺文化。装满了忠于一个国王的狂热者的长船在海面上出发，寻找新的岛屿进行掠夺。那些带着最好的货物和最大的伤痕回来的人往往会成为下一个国王。",
	"The Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles are descended from Tethyrian settlers who came to the islands a thousand years ago. The Ffolk have a deep respect for nature and are primarily farmers, worshiping the goddess they call the Earthmother and keeping to old druidic ways. Ffolk shipwrights are well regarded, having proven their ability to build sturdy ships that are capable of weathering the tumultuous seas around their home. The leader of the Ffolk is High King Derid Kendrick, who rules from the fortress of Caer Callidyr on Alaron. Despite their official ruler, the Ffolk are not the kind to be bound by society, and the druids of the woods and mountains pay little heed to the High King's court.": "摩恩沙群岛的福尔克人是一千年前来到岛上的特提亚移民的后代。福尔克人对自然有着深深的敬意，他们主要是农民，崇拜他们称之为大地之母的女神，并保持着古老的德鲁伊教方式。福尔克人的造船师受到好评，他们证明了自己有能力建造坚固的船只，能够经受住家园周围动荡不安的海洋。福克族的领袖是大王德里德-肯德里克，他在阿拉龙的卡勒-卡利迪尔堡垒中统治。尽管他们是官方统治者，但弗福克人并不是那种受社会约束的人，森林和山脉中的德鲁伊们对大王的宫廷很少理会。",
	"The history of the North is replete with tales of orc hordes spilling out of the mountains to attack the mines, ranches, farmsteads, and settlements of other folk. When a particularly strong orc chieftain unites multiple tribes under one banner, the resulting horde typically rampages across the land, laying waste to strongholds and slaughtering other creatures in its path. Civilised communities form their own coalitions to combat rampaging orcs, with mixed results.": "北方的历史充斥着兽人群从山中涌出，袭击矿场、牧场、农庄和其他民族的定居点的故事。当一个特别强大的兽人首领将多个部落团结在一个旗帜下时，所产生的部落通常会在整个土地上横冲直撞，浪费据点，屠杀沿途的其他生物。文明社区组成自己的联盟来打击猖獗的兽人，但结果不一。",
	"Not all orc chieftains are bent on destruction: King Obould Many-Arrows forged a tenuous alliance with his dwarf neighbours and helped maintain peace in the Silver Marches during his tumultuous reign. Some of the Many-Arrows orcs invaded Neverwinter during its time of troubles and still reside in the Tower District today. Half-orcs in the North are often burdened with the evil reputation of their orc cousins. It takes a half-orc of great character to step out of the shadow of evil and live as an equal among the civilised races.": "并非所有的兽人首领都一心想要毁灭。奥布德-万箭鸟国王与他的矮人邻居建立了脆弱的联盟，并在他动荡的统治期间帮助维持了白银牧场的和平。一些多箭兽人在永夜的动乱时期入侵了永夜，如今仍居住在塔区。北方的半兽人常常背负着他们兽人表亲的邪恶名声。半兽人需要有伟大的品格才能走出邪恶的阴影，以平等的身份生活在文明的种族中。",
	"Shield dwarves (also known as mountain dwarves) have a number of strongholds along the Sword Coast including Ironmaster, Thornhold, and Gauntlgrym. Shield dwarves can also be found in smaller communities in the Island Kingdoms such as the Ironstar dwarves of Mintarn, and scattered clans in the Moonshae Isles. Few non-dwarves live in these bastions of dwarvenkind. Outside their walls, clans of shield dwarves are spread thinly throughout the Sword Coast, to the extent that it's hard to find a settlement that doesn't include at least a handful of dwarven residents.": "盾牌矮人（也被称为山地矮人）在剑海岸有许多据点，包括铁马斯特（Ironmaster）、索恩霍德（Thornhold）和冈特格雷姆（Gauntlgrym）。盾牌矮人也可以在岛屿王国的小型社区中找到，比如明塔恩的铁星矮人，以及月牙岛的零星部族。很少有非矮人居住在这些矮人的堡垒中。在他们的城墙之外，盾牌矮人的部族稀疏地分布在整个剑海岸，以至于很难找到一个不包括至少少数矮人居民的定居点。",
	"Sun elves and moon elves, like dwarves, live among humans in settlements throughout the Sword Coast. The elven kingdoms of old are distant memories even to elves, and only a few ancient ruins and relics of these kingdoms survive. Dangerous and xenophobic wood elves are known to haunt certain forests along the Sword Coast. Few elves live out in the Island Kingdoms, save for the Llewyrr elves of the Moonshaes. They hail from the kingdom of Synnoria on the isle of Gwynneth. The Llewyrr are a mix of wood and moon elves, descended perhaps from a fleet on their way to Evermeet. They are often vegetarian and act as wardens over the animals of Myrloch Vale. The elves here mix freely with dwarves and humans so long as they are respectful of the wildlife.": "太阳精灵和月亮精灵和矮人一样，生活在整个剑海岸的人类定居点中。古老的精灵王国甚至对精灵来说都是遥远的记忆，只有一些古老的遗迹和遗物存留着这些王国。众所周知，危险和排外的木精灵在剑海岸的某些森林中出没。很少有精灵生活在岛屿王国，除了月牙岛的勒维尔精灵。他们来自格温纳斯岛上的辛诺利亚王国。勒维尔人是木精灵和月精灵的混合体，也许是在前往Evermeet途中的舰队的后代。他们通常是素食者，并充当米尔洛赫谷地动物的看守人。这里的精灵与矮人和人类自由混杂，只要他们尊重野生动物。",
	"Small populations of lightfoot halflings can be found in most human-dominated settlements of the Sword Coast. Scattered throughout the fertile valleys of the North are small clusters of strongheart halfling homesteads, some of which spread into the lands of the Sword Coast. Halfling homesteads tend to be off the beaten path and well hidden, minimising the halflings' contact with bandits, barbarians, and marauding monsters. It's not unusual to see a quaint hamlet of halfling homesteads nestled in a grassy ravine or along the shore of a river. There are no large halfling communities in the Island Kingdoms, but families of more adventurous small-folk have emigrated overseas for a shot at a new life.": "在剑海岸大多数以人类为主的定居点，都能找到小部分轻足半身人的存在。在北方肥沃的山谷中，散布着小群强壮的半身人家园，其中一些已经扩散到剑海岸的土地上。半身人的家园往往不在人迹罕至的地方，而且很隐蔽，使半身人与强盗、野蛮人和掠夺性怪物的接触降到最低。在草丛中或河岸边看到一个由半身人家园组成的古朴的小村庄是很平常的。岛屿王国没有大型的半身人社区，但有一些更有冒险精神的小民的家庭已经移居海外，以获得新的生活。",
