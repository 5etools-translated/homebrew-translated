	"The Riverfront Rat Gang is a ratfolk lair, also featuring wharflings and a doppelrat, designed for five 1st-level characters.": "河滨鼠帮是一个鼠族的巢穴，也有鲸鱼和二头鼠，为5个一级角色设计。",
	"The old dockyards once served as the primary center of commerce in town. Years ago, political pressure from an influential merchant who wanted the docks to be closer to her business forced shipping concerns to move their docks upriver. The new facility accommodates larger ships, and the old docks fell into disuse. Talk of converting the property into a set of riverside shops died when a rat infestation proved to be an unsolvable problem. Thus, the old dockyards have been decaying for years.": "老码头曾经是镇上的主要商业中心。几年前，一位有影响力的商人希望码头离她的生意更近，他的政治压力迫使航运公司将码头迁往上游。新的设施可以容纳更大的船只，而旧的码头则被废弃了。当鼠患被证明是一个无法解决的问题时，关于将这块地产改造成一套河边商店的讨论就夭折了。因此，老码头多年来一直在腐烂。",
	"This situation suited a former thieves' guild member, a {@creature ratfolk rogue|tob 3pp} named Matimer Creel. A botched robbery (for which Matimer blamed his accomplice) turned the guild against Matimer, who fled from certain death at the hands of the guild master. He hid out in the old dockyards, confident that not even guild members bothered to go there.": "这种情况适合一个前盗贼公会成员，一个叫马蒂默-克里尔的（%0%）。一次失败的抢劫（马蒂默指责他的同伙）使公会对马蒂默产生了反感，他从公会会长的手中逃过了死亡的命运。他躲在旧船坞里，相信连公会成员都不屑于去那里。",
	"From there he began to exact revenge against the guild by ruining its plans or stealing directly from it. He also befriended the rat population, thanks to a golden rat's tooth he acquired, and the vermin help with his schemes. A trio of rat-like wharflings and a doppelrat, washed up on the riverbank near the docks, have joined Matimer's retinue.": "从那时起，他开始通过破坏公会的计划或直接从公会偷窃来对公会进行报复。他还结识了老鼠群体，这要归功于他获得的一颗金老鼠的牙齿，这些害虫帮助他实施计划。在码头附近的河岸上被冲上岸的三只鼠类和一只二头鼠加入了马蒂默的随从队伍。",
	"The party might visit this riverfront location to help someone retrieve an item stolen by Matimer or his wharfling pets—though so far, no townspeople or thieves know that Matimer is living at the wharf. Alternatively, the thieves' guild might send the characters after their former member. If the characters ask townspeople about the riverfront, with DC 10 Charisma checks they learn about the history of the place (but not about Matimer). They also hear rumors about the thieves' guild operating out of this area.": "队伍可能会去这个河边的地方，帮助别人取回被马蒂默或他的码头宠物偷走的物品--尽管到目前为止，没有镇民或盗贼知道马蒂默住在码头上。另外，盗贼公会可能会派人物去找他们的前成员。如果角色向镇民询问河边的情况，通过DC10魅力检查，他们可以了解到这个地方的历史（但不是关于马蒂默的）。他们还听到了关于盗贼公会在这个地区活动的传言。",
	"The old dockyards feature an upper and a lower walkway. Two main docks jut from the upper walkway, and larger craft used these during the dockyards' heyday. The lower walkway, 20 feet below the upper one, has an area where smaller fishing vessels could unload their cargoes. In the time since shipping moved upriver, the walkway and docks have fallen into disrepair.": "老船坞的特点是有一个上层和一个下层的走道。两个主要的码头从上层走道伸出来，在船坞的全盛时期，较大的船只使用这些码头。下层走道在上层走道的下方20英尺处，有一个小型渔船可以卸下货物的区域。自从航运业向上游发展以来，人行道和码头已经年久失修。",
	"A slow-moving river flanks this wooden walkway along the eastern and southern edges. The walkway's western edge has one intact building among several ruins. Massive holes provide a view of a lower walkway and the water below it. The stench of ancient mold and hints of urine lingers in the area. An intact wooden barrel stands at the northern end.": "一条缓慢流动的河流沿东边和南边的木制人行道两侧。走道的西边在几个废墟中有一个完整的建筑。从巨大的洞口可以看到下面的走道和下面的水。古老的霉菌和尿液的臭味萦绕在这个地区。一个完整的木桶矗立在北端。",
	"The northern end of the walkway provides the best access to it, but daring characters can climb over the rubble that marks the remains of warehouses and offices that once stood along the walkway. Each 10-foot section of walkway marked with a T collapses when anything heavier than 50 pounds rests on one of its squares. Characters who succeed on DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) checks can note the weakened sections and circumvent them. The creatures that inhabit the riverfront are too small to trigger a collapse. Heavier creatures that enter a weakened section must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall down to the lower walkway, falling prone and taking 7 or {@dice 2d6} bludgeoning damage. Those who succeed are able to leap to safety.": "人行道的北端提供了最好的通道，但胆大的人可以爬过瓦砾，这些瓦砾标志着曾经在人行道上的仓库和办公室的遗迹。每段标有T的10英尺长的人行道，当超过50磅的东西放在其中一个方格上时，就会坍塌。通过DC10智慧（感知）检查成功的人物可以注意到被削弱的部分并绕过它们。栖息在河边的生物太小，无法引发坍塌。进入被削弱的部分的较重的生物必须在DC12的灵巧判定中获得成功，否则就会跌落到较低的走道上，俯卧在地并受到7或（%0%）的重击伤害。那些成功的人能够跳到安全地带。",
	"The buildings along the upper walkway were falling apart even before the docks were abandoned. Warehouse and shop owners took the truly valuable items when they moved upriver, and overlooked items have become treasure for Matimer and the wharflings. The burgeoning rat population protects its territory. If the party is careful not to attack or otherwise act aggressively toward the rats, the creatures bristle at the incursion, but leave the characters alone. Aggression causes them to collect into a {@creature swarm of rats} and attack. They do not pursue foes who move at least 10 feet from the alley's entryway.": "甚至在码头被遗弃之前，沿着上层走道的建筑就已经破败不堪。仓库和商店的老板在搬到上游时带走了真正有价值的物品，而被忽视的物品则成为马蒂默和码头工人的宝藏。蓬勃发展的老鼠群体保护着自己的领地。如果一行人小心翼翼地不攻击或以其他方式对老鼠采取行动，这些生物会对入侵感到愤怒，但会放过这些角色。攻击行为会导致它们聚集成一个{@creature swarm of rats}并进行攻击。它们不会追击那些离开小巷入口至少10英尺的敌人。",
	"With an hour of work, the characters can find a few coins in the rubble. An abandoned wharfling nest sits at the end of the alley, but the wharflings removed everything of value. Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence {@skill Nature} check realize that rats did not create this nest.": "经过一个小时的努力，这些人物可以在废墟中找到一些硬币。巷子的尽头有一个废弃的鲸鱼窝，但是鲸鱼们把所有有价值的东西都搬走了。通过DC10智力检查（%0%）成功的角色意识到老鼠并没有创造这个巢穴。",
	"This dock leans downward to the northeast, but seems mostly intact. A crate is sliding slowly and inexorably toward the water.": "这个码头向东北方向倾斜，但似乎基本完好。一个板条箱正缓慢而无情地滑向水面。",
	"The wharflings and rats have gnawed on the beams holding up the docks, and one beam has snapped, causing the dock to twist toward the water. The other support beams still hold, but it will not take much to hasten their collapse.": "鲸鱼和老鼠咬断了支撑码头的横梁，一根横梁断裂了，导致码头向水中扭曲。其他的支撑梁仍然保持着，但不需要太多东西就能加速它们的倒塌。",
	"Once the crate moves into the middle of the dock, the dock falls into the water. Additionally, anything weighing over 100 pounds that moves beyond the western or southern 5 feet of the dock causes it to collapse. The crate weighs 75 pounds and contains rusted iron equipment and weapons. Two small gold bars (worth 25 gp each) rest in a hidden compartment at the bottom of the crate.": "一旦板条箱移动到码头的中间，码头就会落入水中。此外，任何重量超过100磅的东西，只要移动到码头的西部或南部5英尺以外，就会导致码头坍塌。箱子重75磅，里面有生锈的铁制设备和武器。两根小金条（每根价值25戈比）放在箱子底部的暗格里。",
	"Creatures on the dock when it collapses must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the water below. In addition, they must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be hit by the crate, taking 22 or {@dice 4d10} bludgeoning damage.": "当码头倒塌时，码头上的生物必须在DC11灵巧救赎上成功，否则就会掉入下面的水中。此外，他们必须在DC 13的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会被箱子击中，受到22或（%0%）的重击伤害。",
	"A ladder to the north leads down to the lower walkway.": "北面的梯子通往下层走道。",
	"Judging from its appearance, this building served as a warehouse. The remnants of shelves line the walls, and a broken desk covered with crude illustrations sits in the middle of the building, seemingly dragged from its original position. A pile of other debris serves as a makeshift barricade near the entrance. A campfire smolders near the southern wall, the smell of cooked animal wafting from it.": "从它的外观来看，这栋建筑曾是一个仓库。墙上挂着货架的残余物，一张布满粗糙插图的破旧办公桌摆在建筑物的中间，似乎是从原来的位置上拖下来的。一堆其他的碎片在入口附近作为临时路障。一堆篝火在南墙附近熊熊燃烧，里面飘出熟食的味道。",
	"A former adventurer named Donnar Alden, a {@creature druid}, has lived in this warehouse for six months. After witnessing the manifestation of Chittr'k'k, a rat demon, on his last adventure, he retired to these rat-infested docks. Matimer leaves the druid alone, since the man has empathy with the animals and seems harmless.": "一个名叫唐纳-奥尔登的前冒险家，{@creature druid}，已经在这个仓库里住了六个月了。在上一次冒险中目睹了鼠魔Chittr'k'k的显灵后，他退居到这些老鼠出没的码头。马蒂默让德鲁伊一个人呆着，因为这个人与动物有共鸣，而且看起来无害。",
	"If the characters interact with Donnar, he is friendly and shows them charcoal sketches of Chittr'k'k. He answers the characters' questions without betraying Matimer, as below:": "如果人物与唐纳互动，他是友好的，并向他们展示Chittr'k'k的木炭草图。他回答人物的问题时不会背叛马蒂默，如下图。",
	"Donnar retains some of the adventuring gear he used, and characters who defeat the druid—along with a {@creature swarm of rats} that come to his aid—find a magic quarterstaff made of dark walnut and carved with rats and moons that allows the wielder to speak with rats (as speak with animals) and summon one swarm of rats (as conjure animals) once per day. Donnar also carries a strange, small stone idol of Chittr'k'k, the rat-demon, that could be sold to the right collector for 50 gp.": "唐纳保留了一些他用过的冒险装备，击败德鲁伊的人物--以及来帮助他的（%0%）--会发现一根由黑胡桃木制成并刻有老鼠和月亮的魔法四分法杖，可以让持杖者与老鼠对话（如同与动物对话），并每天召唤一群老鼠（如同召唤动物）。唐纳还带着一个奇怪的小石像，即鼠妖奇特克的石像，可以以50金币的价格卖给合适的收藏家。",
	"If the party does not defeat or intimidate Donnar, he goes to warn Matimer as soon as they are gone. Matimer is on his guard and gains an extra swarm of rats as defenders. Donnar seeks other shelter and builds a small shrine to Chittr'k'k elsewhere.": "如果一行人没有打败或恐吓唐纳，他们一走，他就去警告马蒂默。马蒂默提高了警惕，并获得了一群额外的老鼠作为防御者。唐纳寻找其他的庇护所，并在其他地方为奇特克建造了一座小神殿。",
	"The longer wooden dock to the south has numerous missing slats and looks like it would collapse in a stiff breeze. Two shabby wooden ladders flank the dock, leading to the lower walkway. A single crate sits at the edge of the dock, abandoned.": "南面较长的木制码头有许多缺失的板条，看起来会在强风中倒塌。码头两侧有两架破旧的木梯，通向下面的走道。码头边上有一个箱子，被遗弃在那里。",
	"The dock creaks and moans when someone traverses it, but it holds together. The crate is very difficult to pry open (DC 20 Strength to open, AC 15, 10 hp), so Matimer left it in its current position to entice trespassers to investigate it and set off a death trap. The gaps between slats require a DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check to jump. Those that fail the check fall into the water below.": "当有人穿过码头时，码头会发出吱吱的呻吟声，但它还能保持下去。这个箱子很难被撬开（DC20力量打开，AC15，10HP），所以马蒂默把它留在现在的位置，以引诱闯入者去调查它并设置一个死亡陷阱。板条之间的缝隙需要通过DC 5力量（竞技）检查才能跳过。检查失败的人就会掉进下面的水里。",
	"The crate contains four ceramic flasks of oil and a vial of alchemist's fire. If the crate is damaged, the vials break and detonate, dealing 11 (2d10) fire damage to all within 10 feet. A successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. This dock otherwise holds nothing of interest.": "箱子里有四个装油的陶瓷瓶和一个炼金术士之火的小瓶。如果箱子被损坏，小瓶就会破裂并引爆，对10英尺内的所有人造成11（2d10）的火焰伤害。如果成功地进行DC15灵巧救赎，则伤害减半。除此之外，这个码头没有什么值得关注的地方。",
	"Although the dock is safe, neither ladder is. A creature that weighs more than 50 pounds and tries to use a ladder causes it to break away from its moorings and fall 25 feet into the water. With a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, a character can hop off the ladder in time to avoid the fall.": "虽然码头是安全的，但梯子都不是。一个体重超过50磅的生物如果试图使用梯子，就会导致梯子脱离其系泊点并掉入25英尺的水中。通过DC14的灵巧救赎，一个角色可以及时跳下梯子以避免坠落。",
	"A mound of trash blocks a short alleyway. A warehouse and rubble make up the alley's other borders.": "一堆垃圾挡住了一条短小的巷子。一个仓库和瓦砾构成了小巷的其他边界。",
	"The trash comprises the sum of the wharflings' gatherings, which they keep separate from Matimer's collection. Three {@creature wharfling|tob 3pp} are here, either admiring their treasure by night or sleeping by day. They defend their nest fiercely.": "这些垃圾包括码头工人收集的总和，他们把这些垃圾与马蒂默的收藏分开。三只（0%）在这里，要么在晚上欣赏他们的宝藏，要么在白天睡觉。他们激烈地保卫着自己的巢穴。",
	"The mound contains inexpensive items that Matimer allowed the wharflings to keep: 9 cp, a tin dog whistle, a copper hairpin topped with a silver-plated mermaid (worth 5 gp), a dented copper halfling teakettle (1 gp), polished brass buttons (5 sp), and a silver fork with missing middle tines (1 sp).": "这个土堆里有马蒂默允许码头工人保留的廉价物品。9便士，一个锡制狗哨，一个顶着镀银美人鱼的铜制发卡（价值5便士），一个凹陷的铜制半身人茶壶（1便士），抛光的黄铜纽扣（5便士），以及一把中间缺齿的银叉（1便士）。",
	"The end of the walkway is undamaged compared to the remainder. A ladder at the southern terminus leads down, and a large oaken barrel, gnawed at the top but otherwise whole, rests along the eastern edge.": "与其余部分相比，走道的末端没有受到破坏。南部终点处有一个梯子通往下方，东边的边缘放着一个大橡木桶，顶部被咬破，但其他部分是完整的。",
	"Other than the 10-foot-square section by the ladder (noted with a T), this area is free from the pitfalls present elsewhere. The barrel once contained cheap wine, but it is now empty and smells of vinegar.": "除了梯子旁边的10英尺见方的部分（用T表示），这个区域没有其他地方存在的陷阱。桶里曾经装过便宜的酒，但现在已经空了，而且有一股醋味。",
	"Debris covers the dirt and rocks along the river shore. Two corpses rest among the flotsam: a skeleton with gnawed bones, and an intact body resembling that of conjoined twins.": "碎片覆盖了河岸边的泥土和岩石。两具尸体躺在碎石中：一具骨头被咬碎的骨架，以及一具类似于连体婴儿的完整尸体。",
	"Matimer regularly scours this area for treasure, so there is nothing of significance on the beach. The skeleton belonged to a beggar who fell prey to the rats months ago, while the corpse was that of a thieves' guild member sent to investigate reports of thefts originating from the old dockyards. Mortally wounded by the doppelrat in area 9, she succumbed to its degenerate cloning disease and shed a duplicate as she died. Matimer left the body to rot, and the rats give it a wide berth, so a search turns up a +1 dagger and a set of {@item thieves' tools|phb}.": "马蒂默经常在这一地区寻找宝藏，所以海滩上没有什么重要的东西。这具骷髅属于几个月前被老鼠咬死的乞丐，而这具尸体是一个盗贼公会的成员，被派去调查来自旧船坞的盗窃报告。她在第9区被二重身所伤，屈服于二重身的退化性克隆病，死后留下了一个复制品。马蒂默让尸体腐烂，老鼠们对它敬而远之，所以在搜索中发现了一把+1匕首和一套（%0%）。",
	"Larger rats roam this area, crawling around an eight-foot-tall pile of trash. Beyond the enormous rats' nest, a hole cuts off access to the southern end of the walkway. Three ladders lead to the upper walkway.": "更大的老鼠在这个区域游荡，在一个八英尺高的垃圾堆周围爬行。在巨大的老鼠窝之外，一个洞切断了通往走道南端的通道。三个梯子通向上面的走道。",
	"If Matimer is aware of the party's arrival, he whips the {@creature doppelrat|tob 3pp} here into a frenzy, allowing it 2 rounds of duplication before characters arrive. He hides behind the nest in area 10 while the doppelrat attacks. Eight {@creature rat|mm|rats} stay out of combat unless something attacks them.": "如果马蒂默知道队伍的到来，他就会把这里的{@creature doppelrat|tob 3pp}鞭打得狂乱不堪，让它在人物到来之前进行2轮复制。他躲在10号区域的巢穴后面，而二重奏的攻击。除非有东西攻击他们，否则八只（%1%）不参加战斗。",
	"The nest contains only a few copper pieces, since Matimer and the wharflings have claimed everything else. However, searching through the nest exposes characters to a rat-borne disease.": "巢穴里只有几块铜片，因为马蒂默和鲸鱼人已经把其他东西都拿走了。然而，在巢穴中搜索时，人物暴露在一种由老鼠传播的疾病中。",
	"This end of the lower walkway holds a nest that is tidier than the others. Stacks of coins, waterlogged books, and other items are sorted into piles. A ladder connects this level to the above walkway.": "下层走道的这一端有一个比其他地方更整洁的巢穴。成堆的硬币、积水的书籍和其他物品被分类堆放。一个梯子将这一层与上面的走道连接起来。",
	"Matimer spends most of his time here when he is not stealing items from townspeople or taking revenge against the thieves' guild. The river and the walkway obstacles provide him a sense of security. If the party reaches his lair, he offers them expensive items to get them to leave. If the characters seem amenable, he attempts to enlist them in his vendetta against the thieves' guild.": "马蒂默在这里度过了大部分时间，当他不偷窃镇民的物品或对盗贼公会进行报复的时候。河流和走道上的障碍物为他提供了安全感。如果队伍到达他的巢穴，他就向他们提供昂贵的物品，让他们离开。如果这些人物看起来很顺从，他就试图让他们加入他对盗贼公会的报复。",
	"Matimer's amassed wealth includes 74 gp, 190 sp, a pair of sapphire-studded earrings (worth 275 gp), a silver dagger (50 gp), a gold ring with an emerald inset (310 gp), and a variety of keys to lost locks, distant chests, and mundane doors—and one to the town's postern gate that is very valuable for Matimer's sneaking around, and that the thieves' guild would very much like back. Also among Matimer's collection are lists of guild member targets—with a couple of names crossed off.": "马蒂默积累的财富包括74金币、190英镑、一对镶有蓝宝石的耳环（价值275金币）、一把银质匕首（50金币）、一枚镶嵌有绿宝石的金戒指（310金币），以及各种丢失的锁、遥远的箱子和普通的门的钥匙--还有一把镇上后门的钥匙，对马蒂默的潜行非常有价值，而盗贼公会非常希望能拿回来。在马蒂默的收藏中，还有公会成员的目标名单--其中有几个名字被划掉了。",
	"If the party defeats Matimer, the thieves' guild claims the old dockyards as a secondary headquarters after exterminating the rats. Characters who search the ratfolk's collection discover a beautifully engraved parade helmet that the captain of the town watch claims to have lost, and for which the captain would surely pay a 5 gp reward (if its return were made quietly). Cleaning out all the treasure here will provoke the guild's ire, potentially causing problems for the characters in areas influenced by the guild and their allies.": "如果队伍打败了马蒂默，盗贼公会在消灭了老鼠之后，会将旧码头作为第二总部。搜查鼠人收藏品的角色发现了一个雕刻精美的阅兵头盔，镇上的守夜人队长声称丢失了这个头盔，为了这个头盔，队长肯定会支付5GP的赏金（如果能悄悄地归还的话）。清理这里的所有宝藏会激起公会的愤怒，可能会给受公会及其盟友影响的地区的人物带来麻烦。",
	"Lost Halls of Everforge is a flame dragon wyrmling lair suitable for four or five 3rd-level characters.": "埃弗弗格的失落大厅是一个火焰龙巫妖的巢穴，适合四到五个三级角色使用。",
	"The Everforge clan of dwarves once held a place of honor and prestige, their weaponsmiths unrivaled in dwarven lands. The clan welcomed all visitors to its ancestral halls, but none were allowed into the Great Forge, which was magically linked to the Elemental Plane of Fire.": "矮人的Everforge部族曾经拥有荣誉和声望，他们的武器匠人在矮人的土地上无人能及。该部族欢迎所有来访者参观其祖先的大厅，但没有人被允许进入大锻造厂，它与火元素世界有着神奇的联系。",
	"Decades ago, efreet found the bridge between worlds. The fire creatures sprang from the Great Forge and slaughtered the Everforge clan, burning their bones to ashes. The only survivor was Polla Everforge, the matriarch of the family. Skilled in elemental magic, she severed the link to the Plane of Fire and dismissed the rampaging efreet. The damage, however, had been done.": "几十年前，埃弗里特发现了世界间的桥梁。火焰生物从大锻造厂涌出，屠杀了Everforge家族，将他们的骨头烧成灰烬。唯一的幸存者是Polla Everforge，这个家族的族长。她精通元素魔法，切断了与火界的联系，驱散了肆虐的埃弗里特。然而，伤害已经造成了。",
	"Recently a human sage named Spencius, who serves a flame dragon called Igbalneum, decided to rekindle the Great Forge. He believes a dragon that is bathed in elemental fire will become invincible. Thus, he sent bandits to abduct Polla and bring her to the Lost Halls so that he could force her to reopen the connection to the Plane of Fire. He brought Igbalneum and the dragon's servants to brush the dust off the Halls and make his theory a reality.": "最近，一位名叫斯宾塞斯的人类贤者，为一条名叫伊格巴伦的火焰龙服务，决定重新点燃大锻造炉。他相信沐浴在火元素中的龙会变得无敌。因此，他派强盗绑架了波拉，把她带到了失落大厅，这样他就可以强迫她重新打开与火界的联系。他带着伊格巴伦和龙的仆人来刷掉大厅的灰尘，使他的理论成为现实。",
	"Polla Everforge has gone missing from her forge-home in the characters' city. Signs of a struggle in her smithy hint at abduction. Some suspect she might have been taken to her long-abandoned ancestral home: the Halls of Everforge.

Beyond the gears to the north, a mechanical man and its hound stand motionless.": "一个小齿轮，由曲轴提供动力，曲轴的终点是一个闪闪发光的金色球体，在西边，它提供了转动大齿轮的动力。在北方的齿轮之外，一个机械人和它的猎犬一动不动地站着。",
	"The Clockworkers' Guild inspectors noted an oddity when they performed their initial investigations: the gears in this section seemed unnecessary.

	"The shafts lead through the ceiling and provide small gaps through which smaller creatures can squeeze. The gremlins' tiny size allows them to pass through the gaps without any problem, and they use the shafts to hide from the clockwork creatures. If a larger creature is caught in the gears by purposefully moving through the area or being shoved into the gears, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 22 {@dice 4d10} bludgeoning damage and be restrained.

	"A character who can speak Auran learns of the elemental's desire for freedom.

As a bonus action, the gremlin can use the lightning device to deal 9 {@dice 2d8} lightning damage to a character and force the character to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet.

	"Fortunately for the surviving ratatosk, a portal between their planar home and the village of Nargenstal allowed them to escape. The displaced ratatosk, doubting the adventurers are altruistic enough to help them without payment, attempt to trick them into ridding their former home of the beast and its servants so that the squirrel-folk might return.": "幸运的是，对于幸存的鼠人来说，他们的星球家园和纳根斯塔尔村之间的一个传送门使他们得以逃脱。流离失所的ratatosk怀疑冒险者是否有足够的利他主义，在没有报酬的情况下帮助他们，试图欺骗他们，把他们以前的家赶出野兽和它的仆人，这样松鼠民就可以返回。",
	"At the end of the adventure The Raven's Call (Kobold Press, 2015), the characters (hopefully) freed the village of Nargenstal from the clutches of the ogre Coalkell and his trollkin cohorts.

Grutilda does not reveal that her real goal in approaching the PCs is to encourage them to use the portal to travel to Yggdrasil's branches, where they might defeat the lindwurm and its servants. Grutilda hopes to secure their assistance by offering to make a potion for them.": "格鲁蒂尔达没有直截了当地撒谎，但她没有给出全部的真相。连接世界之树的鼠尾草分支和这个地区的传送门确实构成了威胁，尽管多年来没有人（除了鼠尾草）通过它。然而，现在林德沃姆已经控制了这个分支，它可以轻易地通过传送门，威胁到村庄。格鲁蒂尔达并没有透露她接近NPC的真正目的是鼓励他们使用传送门去Yggdrasil的分支，在那里他们可能会打败林沃姆和它的仆人。格鲁蒂尔达希望通过为他们制作一种药水来获得他们的帮助。",
	"To defeat the Dread Ice Wyrm, you must resist its icy breath. I can help with this by brewing a potion that will make cold a mere inconvenience.

I can show you a nearby portal that will take you there.": "要打败可怕的冰魔，你必须抵御它的冰冷气息。我可以通过酿造一种药水来帮助你，这种药水可以使寒冷成为一种不便。但要做到这一点，我必须要有四种材料：生命果实的汁液、银刺的尖端、血叶的茎和林德沃姆的冷冻粪便。这些东西都可以在世界树Yggdrasil的树枝上找到。我可以告诉你附近的一个传送门会带你到那里。",
	"This is all technically true, though the ratatosk is shading the truth—gathering those ingredients does permit the ratatosk to brew such a potion, but it also puts the heroes directly in the lindwurm's path. Grutilda hopes they don't question her rather convincing story—she has a +8 bonus on Charisma {@skill Deception} checks. If they do quiz her closely, she admits that she feared they would not help without proper motivation, and she needs the PCs to defeat the lindwurm so that she and her followers can return. She can make a potion of cold resistance with the ingredients, but the ratatosk have no other treasure to offer, since the lindwurm's forces pillaged everything.": "这在技术上都是真实的，尽管老鼠精在掩盖事实--收集这些材料确实允许老鼠精酿制这样的药水，但它也使英雄们直接陷入了林德沃姆的道路。格鲁蒂尔达希望他们不要质疑她那相当有说服力的故事--她有一个+8的魅力（%0%）检查奖励。如果他们仔细询问她，她会承认她担心他们在没有适当动机的情况下不会帮忙，而且她需要NPC打败林德沃姆，这样她和她的追随者就可以回去了。她可以用原料制作抗寒药水，但是鼠人没有其他的宝物可以提供，因为林德沃姆的军队掠夺了一切。",
	"The portal to the ratatosk's former home on the branches of Yggdrasil is a couple of hours away, hidden in a forest near the village. Grutilda takes the PCs there, urging them to hurry back after completing their mission.": "通往Yggdrasil树枝上的ratatosk故居的传送门有几个小时的路程，隐藏在村庄附近的森林中。格鲁蒂尔达带着NPC去那里，敦促他们在完成任务后赶紧回来。",
	"When the PCs enter the portal, they emerge into a brightly lit area high in the branches of Yggdrasil. Each of the three branches comprising this lair is separated from the one next to it by 10 feet: the topmost branch holds areas 1 and 2, the middle branch areas 3 and 4, and the lowest branch area 5. Characters who fall from one branch fall only 10 or 20 feet before hitting either branches or leaves. Vines allow them to climb back up if desired.": "当NPC进入传送门时，他们会出现在Yggdrasil树枝上的一个光线明亮的区域。构成这个巢穴的三根树枝与旁边的树枝各相隔10英尺：最上面的树枝有1和2区，中间的树枝有3和4区，而最下面的树枝有5区。从一个树枝上掉下来的人物，在碰到树枝或树叶之前，只掉了10或20英尺。如果需要的话，藤蔓可以让他们重新爬上去。",
	"As you emerge from the portal, the ever-present smell of pine is replaced by a sweeter, fruity scent. You stand on a colossal branch, its rough bark making your footing unsure. Many more branches, all extending in different directions, obscure your view. Plump red berries, each at least three feet in diameter, are attached to smaller branches off the one you travel.": "当你从传送门出来时，一直存在的松树气味被一种更甜美的果香所取代。你站在一根巨大的树枝上，它粗糙的树皮使你的脚步不稳。还有许多树枝，都向不同方向延伸，遮住了你的视线。丰满的红色浆果，每个直径至少有三英尺，附在你走过的那根树枝上的小树枝上。",
	"The red berries are lifecurrants, which hold the juice that Grutilda asked the PCs to secure. Getting the juice from a lifecurrant is a tricky proposition: if a berry is pierced or slashed without great care, it explodes, sending purplish-red juices geysering forth in all directions. Any creature within 10 feet of such an explosion must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1d3 rounds by the spraying juice. In order to get the juice safely, a DC 10 Dexterity {@skill Sleight of Hand} check is needed, along with a small piercing weapon and a suitable container.": "红色的浆果是救生果，里面有格鲁蒂尔达要求NPC确保的果汁。从生命果实中获取果汁是个棘手的问题：如果不小心刺穿或割破了浆果，它就会爆炸，使紫红色的汁液向四面八方喷涌而出。任何在这种爆炸10英尺范围内的生物都必须做一个DC 10的灵巧反射，否则就会被喷出的果汁弄瞎1d3轮。为了安全地获取汁液，需要进行DC10灵巧（%0%）的检查，同时需要一个小型的穿刺武器和一个合适的容器。",

On that lower branch, several large thorns glint silver in the sunlight, their tips pointing upward at you.": "随着你向北移动，树枝上的树皮变得更加不平整。在你下方10英尺处，另一根树枝与你所走的那根树枝垂直。在那根较低的树枝上，有几根大刺在阳光下闪着银光，它们的尖端朝上指向你。",

They beg the PCs to let them escape with their young.": "如果乌鸦人的侦察兵离开这个区域去和区域1的NPC交战，守卫会呼唤10个（%0%），他们会在第二轮开始时回应，骚扰NPC。鸦族人担心年轻人和他们被俘的首领的安全，毫不犹豫地发动了攻击。如果他们在被击败后被询问，乌鸦族会向NPC描述他们的困境，承认他们不能对林德沃姆或它的其他仆人做任何事情，因为害怕报复。他们恳求NPC让他们带着他们的孩子逃走。",

	"Very fine webbing, practically invisible unless observed carefully with a DC 15 Wisdom {@skill Perception} check, runs among the silverthorns. Creatures that land on the branch disturb the webbing, which alerts the seven {@creature giant spider|mm|giant spiders} here that a potential meal has arrived. The spiders hide on the underside of the branch. Two spiders attack in the first round, three more arrive at the start of round 3, and the final two join the battle at the start of round 5.": "非常细的网状物，几乎是看不见的，除非用DC15智慧（%0%）检查来仔细观察，在银刺之间流动。落在树枝上的生物会扰乱网状物，从而提醒这里的七只（1%）蜘蛛，一个潜在的食物已经到来。蜘蛛们躲在树枝的下面。第一轮有两只蜘蛛攻击，第三轮开始时又有三只蜘蛛到达，最后两只在第五轮开始时加入战斗。",
	"The silverthorns contain a potent sap that can counteract the effects of poison. A character can identify this quality with a successful DC 10 Intelligence {@skill Nature} check.

The poison-cleansing properties of the sap disappear 1 hour after it is extracted.": "银刺含有一种有效的汁液，可以抵消毒药的影响。一个角色可以通过成功的DC 10智力（%0%）检查来识别这种品质。刺入刺的一侧并提取树液需要一个动作。汁液的清毒特性在提取后1小时后消失。",
	"This part of the branch contains thicker, denser webbing than in the silverthorn area. Two small, vaguely humanoid-shaped mounds of webs stand out amid the other webbing. Six very large, blood-red leaves, attached to the branch by thick stems, twitch slightly in the light breeze.": "枝条的这一部分包含比银刺区更厚、更密集的网状物。在其他网状物中，有两个隐约呈人形的小网丘很突出。六片非常大的血红色的叶子，通过粗大的茎连接到树枝上，在轻风中微微抽动。",
	"The webbed forms are gnome siblings named Eddinna and Frillo Sweetsop, who accidentally came here through a different portal days ago and stumbled into the clutches of four {@creature ettercap|mm|ettercaps}, which serve as lieutenants for the lindwurm. The ettercaps conceal themselves in the webbing when they notice combat taking place in area 3, and a successful DC 15 Wisdom {@skill Perception} check is needed to see them in their hiding places.": "这些有蹼的形态是地精兄妹，名叫艾丁娜和弗里罗-斯威索普，他们几天前意外地从另一个传送门来到这里，并偶然落入四个（%0%）的魔掌，它们是林德沃姆的副手。当埃特卡普注意到3号区域发生的战斗时，他们会把自己藏在网状物中，需要成功通过DC15智慧（%1%）检查才能看到他们的藏身之处。",
	"The leaves attached to the branch are bloodleaves: semi- sentient, blood-drinking plants. They sense the proximity of warm-blooded creatures, and they swat with their broad, flat surfaces at any target that comes within reach. The 10-foot square directly in front of the stem of each leaf is the danger zone. When a warm-blooded creature starts its turn in one of those places, the bloodleaf attacks with a spiny swat (+4 to hit, 1 piercing damage, DC 11 Constitution save to avoid {@dice 1d6} damage as blood is drained).

	"The {@creature lindwurm|tob 3pp} begins the encounter squeezed into one of the holes at the southern end of the branch, where it has been keeping a close eye on its prisoner, the ravenfolk doom croaker. When a character arrives on its branch, the lindwurm emerges from its hiding place and attacks. The characters can use the passageways inside the branch, accessible through the holes, to take cover from the lindwurm and attack from hiding.

	"If the PCs return to the village, Grutilda the ratatosk is equally appreciative of their efforts. Although she has no treasure or arcane gifts, she can craft a potion as promised. Also, the ratatosk are expert guides around the branches and roots of Yggdrasil. If the characters ever have need of interplanar travel, the ratatosk eagerly volunteer to take them to their destination by way of one of the World Tree's portals.": "如果NPC回到村子里，鼠人Grutilda也会对他们的努力表示感谢。虽然她没有宝物或神秘的礼物，但她可以按照承诺制作一种药水。另外，鼠人是Yggdrasil的树枝和树根周围的专业向导。如果人物需要进行星际旅行，ratatosk会热心地自愿通过世界树的一个传送门将他们带到目的地。",
	"Due to the way the map was labeled and the sections were labeled the section titles were changed in order to match the map.": "由于地图的标示方式和章节的标示方式，章节的标题被改变，以便与地图相匹配。",
	"A welcoming desert oasis offers respite from the searing wasteland, but this paradise has perils. Castle of Sand is suitable for three to five 4th-level characters.": "热情洋溢的沙漠绿洲为人们提供了远离灼热荒原的喘息机会，但这个天堂也有危险。沙之城堡适合于三到五个四级人物。",
	"Imsim the dau lives a mostly solitary life in the remote desert. His home is inviting—splendid, beautiful, shaded, and cool—but it's all an illusion. The dau are tricksters, and Imsim's oasis is an illusion designed to lure in travelers--not because the dau means anyone harm, but because visitors break the monotony, and illusions are much easier to create and maintain than real structures. As it happens, the oasis is also a prison for the dau's enemy, a captive mirager.": "在偏远的沙漠中，多伊姆西姆基本上过着孤独的生活。他的家很诱人--华丽、美丽、阴凉，但这都是假象。达乌人是诡计多端的人，伊姆西姆的绿洲是一种幻觉，旨在引诱旅行者--不是因为达乌人对任何人都有恶意，而是因为游客打破了单调的生活，而幻觉比真实的结构更容易创造和维护。碰巧的是，这个绿洲也是Dau的敌人--一个被俘虏的海市蜃楼的监狱。",
	"Though the buildings and the date palms are illusory, the danger here is real enough for anyone who transgresses Imsim's rules of etiquette or tampers with his prisoner.": "虽然这些建筑和枣树都是虚幻的，但对于任何违反伊姆西姆的礼仪规则或捣乱的人来说，这里的危险是真实的。",
	"The best way for characters to encounter Imsim is a classic trope: desert travelers, suffering from heat and thirst, crest a sand dune or a stony hill and suddenly find themselves looking down on a lush, cool oasis. Characters might be drawn in this direction by the sight of birds circling in the distance; where there are birds, there's likely to be water. It's also possible that characters heard about this oasis from other travelers who never saw through the illusions and thus never encountered Imsim or Naydleh. In that case, the oasis might look significantly different from how it was described to the characters or represented on a desert map, because Imsim can change his illusions daily to suit his whims.": "角色遇到Imsim的最佳方式是一个经典的套路：沙漠旅行者饱受炎热和干渴之苦，爬上沙丘或石山，突然发现自己俯瞰着一片郁郁葱葱的凉爽绿洲。人物可能被远处盘旋的鸟儿吸引到这个方向；有鸟的地方就可能有水。也有可能人物从其他旅行者那里听说了这个绿洲，但他们没有看穿这些幻觉，因此没有遇到伊姆西姆或奈德勒赫。在这种情况下，绿洲的外观可能与人物所描述的或沙漠地图上显示的大不相同，因为伊姆西姆可以每天改变他的幻觉以适应他的想法。",
	"Most of the oasis is created by Imsim's mirage arcane spell. Mirage arcane is one of the most powerful of all illusions. Short of truesight, almost nothing can see through it or detect its false nature. The illusion looks, sounds, smells, and even feels completely real. In contrast, Naydleh's hallucinatory terrain effect looks, sounds, and smells real, but it can't alter the feel of the actual terrain, so characters who express doubt and make a successful DC 16 Intelligence {@skill Investigation} check recognize that they're seeing an illusion. Likewise, Imsim's programmed illusion can be recognized as an illusion by someone who interacts with it (hitting it with an attack, for example) and makes a successful DC 13 Intelligence {@skill Investigation} check.": "绿洲的大部分是由Imsim的海市蜃楼奥术法术创造的。幻术是所有幻术中最强大的一种。除了真视力之外，几乎没有任何东西能看穿它或发现它的虚假性质。这种幻觉看起来、听起来、闻起来，甚至感觉完全是真实的。相比之下，Naydleh的幻觉地形效果看起来、听起来和闻起来都很真实，但它不能改变实际地形的感觉，所以表示怀疑并成功进行DC16智力（%0%）检查的人物会认识到他们看到的是一个幻觉。同样地，Imsim的程序化幻象可以被与它互动（例如用攻击击中它）并成功进行DC13智力（%1%）检查的人识别为幻象。",
	"Each area of the oasis begins with read-aloud text that describes how Imsim's or Naydleh's illusion appears, followed by details of what lies beneath the illusions.": "绿洲的每个区域都以朗读文本开始，描述伊姆西姆或奈德勒的幻觉是如何出现的，然后是幻觉下面的细节。",
	"Your prayers are answered! Spreading before you is an oasis of palm trees, small plants, and clear water. Birds wheel overhead and wade along the reedy banks of the pond. A crumbling tomb stands at the edge of the greenery. A second small building is nestled among the palms. It could be a shelter erected by regular travelers along this route. As far as you can see, you have the oasis to yourselves.": "你的祈祷得到了回应! 在你面前展开的是一个由棕榈树、小植物和清澈的水组成的绿洲。鸟儿在头顶上飞翔，沿着池塘里长满芦苇的岸边涉水。一座破败的坟墓矗立在绿色植物的边缘。第二座小楼依偎在棕榈树之间。它可能是这条路线上的普通旅行者所搭建的庇护所。就你们所见，你们拥有自己的绿洲。",
	"This large pool of clear, cool water is shaded by date palms and ringed by reeds that sway gently in the breeze. You even see a few small fish darting among the reeds and stones, implying that this restful pool never dries out—a marvelous thing in this arid land.": "这一大池清澈凉爽的水被椰枣树遮蔽，周围是芦苇，在微风中轻轻摇曳。你甚至可以看到几条小鱼在芦苇和石头之间飞来飞去，这意味着这个宁静的水池永远不会干涸--这在这片干旱的土地上是一件了不起的事情。",

A character with a Constitution score of 9 or lower who drinks more than a swallow of this water gains one level of exhaustion within 15 minutes; the exhaustion lasts until after the character completes a long rest.": "这里真正的水是泥泞的，而且气味难闻，但它是真实的，所以动物和人可以解渴，水壶和水皮可以被填满。体质评分为9分或更低的角色如果喝了超过一口这种水，会在15分钟内获得一级疲惫；这种疲惫会持续到该角色完成长时间休息之后。",
	"The {@creature bulette} that lurks in the mud below the pool attacks if any creature (characters, horses, or camels) wades into the pool and stirs up the mud. The {@creature bulette} is aware of the quicksand (and unaffected by it, thanks to its burrowing ability), so it tries to lure enemies into that area. When the {@creature bulette} is reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, it burrows away to safety, if it can.": "如果有任何生物（人物、马或骆驼）涉足水池并搅动泥浆，潜伏在水池下方泥浆中的（%0%）就会攻击。{@creature bulette}知道流沙（并且不受流沙的影响，这要归功于它的钻地能力），所以它试图引诱敌人进入该区域。当（%2%）的命中率降至20或更低时，如果可以的话，它就会钻到安全地带。",
	"Imsim's illusion makes two areas next to the pool look like solid ground, but the terrain is actually quicksand.

	"Naydleh uses suggestion against whomever it deems to be the party's leader. The mirager uses charm person only if it believes it can slip away before the spell expires. Naydleh is very convincing and persuasive even without these spells. It wants to escape captivity and get revenge against Imsim for a century of imprisonment, so it uses all its wiles to persuade the party that it's a kidnapped human.": "Naydleh对它认为是聚会领袖的人使用暗示。镜中人只有在它认为可以在咒语失效前溜走时才会使用魅惑人。即使没有这些法术，奈德勒也非常具有说服力和说服力。它想逃脱囚禁，为一个世纪的监禁向伊姆西姆报仇，所以它用所有的诡计来说服队伍，说它是一个被绑架的人类。",
	"Exactly what the mirager presses for depends on the characters' reactions.

If a fight breaks out, it triggers Imsim's programmed illusion of a djinni materializing behind the dau. The djinni can't fight, but it looks incredibly menacing in the crowded room and adds weight to Imsim's commands for order.

If Price is with them, she'll lead the crew, but she expects to command the ship as her own and will fight to keep it.": "如果NPC爬上继承者号，他们可以掠夺800金币、一个能容纳12个（0%）的箱子和一个不常见的魔法物品。如果他们愿意的话，他们也可以带走这艘船，不过他们需要至少12名船员来驾驶它。如果普莱斯和他们在一起，她会带领船员，但她希望把这艘船当作自己的船来指挥，并会为保留它而战斗。",
	"If the PCs rescue Red Bertram, Captain Jenny is true to her word. She gives the PCs 150 gp apiece, and tells them that she owes them a favor. If the characters come back to Jenny without Bertram but the pirates have been slain, Jenny pays them 75 gp each, and she does not offer them a favor. Either way, within a few months, the PCs hear rumors of an island emerging from the waves not far from the island where the Inheritor was docked. Perhaps there's a connection—and the Temple of the Deep Ones lair provides a ready follow-up for a future mission.": "如果NPC救出Red Bertram，Jenny船长就会信守承诺。她给了NPC每人150戈比，并告诉他们她欠他们一个人情。如果角色们没有带着Bertram回到Jenny身边，但海盗已经被杀，Jenny会付给他们每人75gp，而且她不会给他们一个人情。无论怎样，在几个月内，NPC听到了关于一个岛屿的传言，这个岛屿从海浪中出现，离继承者号停靠的岛屿不远。也许这其中有什么联系--深海之神的巢穴为未来的任务提供了一个现成的后续。",

	"In the distant past, followers of Sanvi, a long-forgotten goddess of destiny, knowledge, and vision, built temples devoted to the goddess, who endowed the buildings with the ability to materialize in seemingly random places. At each location, her acolytes held a lottery and gave three winners access to the temple's inner sanctum, where they could divine their futures or receive an answer to a question concerning their fate. As word spread, these lotteries became popular among commoners, but hated by society's elite, who never won a lottery or gained admittance to the temples.": "在遥远的过去，桑维（Sanvi）的追随者，一位早已被遗忘的命运、知识和远见的女神，建造了专门供奉女神的寺庙，女神赋予了这些建筑在看似随机的地方实现的能力。在每一个地方，她的信徒都会举行抽奖活动，并让三名中奖者进入寺庙的内部圣殿，在那里他们可以预知自己的未来，或者得到关于他们命运的问题的答案。随着消息的传播，这些抽奖活动在平民中变得很受欢迎，但却被社会精英所憎恨，他们从来没有赢得过抽奖，也没有获得过进入寺庙的机会。",
	"Eventually, these enemies conspired to destroy the temples whenever they appeared. Only one of the temples has survived to this day, sequestered in a remote location in a state of stasis.

	"After speaking with the townsfolk about the building, the characters learn that a bright blue flash presaged the building's arrival. One of the two victims is missing his eyes, while the other is blinded from night scorpion poison, something a character can discern with a DC 12 Intelligence {@skill Nature} or Wisdom {@skill Medicine} check or a detect poison and disease spell. If the characters question the victims, they rant about huge insects and hundreds of eyes descending upon them.": "在与乡亲们谈论过这栋建筑后，角色们了解到一个明亮的蓝色闪光预示着这栋建筑的到来。两名受害者中的一人失去了眼睛，而另一人则是被夜蝎子的毒药弄瞎的，这一点角色可以通过DC12智力（%0%）或智慧（%1%）检查或检测毒药和疾病法术来辨别。如果角色询问受害者，他们会咆哮着说有巨大的昆虫和数百只眼睛降临在他们身上。",
	"The building is located 200 feet off the main road leading into town. The stone exterior is pitted and stained, but characters can see faded, stylized eyes covering the building's walls.

Two small doors lead to the south, and a large door leads east.": "掩盖了建筑外表的寒酸，这个房间是一尘不染的。入口处正对面摆着一张桌子，上面摆满了丰盛的食物和酒瓶的托盘。沿着南北墙矗立着两座古老风格的雕像，雕的是一个手握黑球的女人，她似乎把整个房间都看在眼里。两扇小门通向南方，一扇大门通向东方。",
	"This area was a mess hall and devotion chamber for Sanvi's followers.

The curtain conceals a fountain topped with a purple globe through which water flows. Beyond the fountain is a second curtain that encloses an apparently empty chamber. Although the water from the fountain is refreshing, its most important purpose is to reveal the secret door on the southern wall. Those who wash their eyes with the water can see the secret door. If no one does this, a character must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom {@skill Perception} check to find the door.": "当寺庙运作时，这个房间西部的厨房满足了桑维的信徒的需要。帘子上隐藏着一个喷泉，上面有一个紫色的圆球，水从那里流过。喷泉之外是第二道帘子，围着一个显然是空的房间。虽然喷泉的水让人神清气爽，但它最重要的作用是揭开南墙的秘密之门。用水洗过眼睛的人可以看到那扇秘密的门。如果没有人这样做，人物必须通过DC25智慧（%0%）的检查才能成功找到那扇门。",

	"To open the secret door to the south, discovered with a DC 10 Wisdom {@skill Perception} check, all beams must be broken at the 5-foot height.

Terror and chaos followed as the creatures brought swift and sudden death, killing most of the alseid tribe members with razor-sharp teeth and deadly, black breath.": "在其中一次仪式中，地面发出隆隆声，一股浓郁的黑色能量柱从墓冢中直射到夜空。浓重的黑暗笼罩着该地区，突然失明的阿尔塞人听到了可怕的吼叫声。一瞬间，黑暗消散了，露出了立石中环抱着骷髅的神秘水池。两个巨大的、像龙一样的生物，长着黑色的鳞片和燃烧的红色眼睛，瞪着困惑的阿尔塞德人。地上躺着瑞亚塔的尸体，死一般的寂静。恐怖和混乱接踵而至，这些生物带来了迅速而突然的死亡，用锋利的牙齿和致命的黑色气息杀死了大多数阿尔塞德部落成员。",
	"The alseids that survived the initial, bloody attack fled into the forest. They counterattacked a few hours later, desperate to reclaim their grove and recover the body of their beloved leader, but the attempt was a fiasco and they were quickly driven off. Now, the few remaining alseids hide in the forest, frightened and unsure what to do next.": "在最初的血腥攻击中幸存下来的阿尔塞人逃进了森林。几个小时后，他们发动了反击，不顾一切地想夺回他们的小树林，找回他们心爱的领袖的尸体，但这次尝试是一场惨败，他们很快被赶走了。现在，剩下的几个阿尔塞德人躲在森林里，惊慌失措，不知道下一步该怎么做。",
	"The adventurers are exploring the forest and meet the beleaguered alseids, who beg for help.": "冒险家们在森林中探险，遇到了被围困的阿尔塞德人，他们乞求帮助。",
	"A well-worn path meanders through the dark and foreboding forest. The screeches of birds and the low, plaintive howls of other forest creatures echo among the dense trees. The path is covered with dirt, twigs, wild grasses, and small rocks and stones. Gently running water can be heard up ahead.": "一条破旧的小路蜿蜒穿过黑暗和不祥的森林。鸟儿的尖叫声和其他森林生物的低沉嚎叫声在茂密的树林中回荡。这条路布满了泥土、树枝、野草和小石头。前面可以听到轻轻的流水声。",
	"The detritus on the ground makes it difficult to move silently, imposing disadvantage on the characters' Stealth checks.": "地面上的碎石使其难以悄悄地移动，对人物的隐身检查造成不利影响。",
	"The path opens into a small clearing with several jagged rock formations. The trunk of a fallen tree spans the width of the stream. On the far side of the stream, the path continues into the forest. A badly injured fawn lies panting at the water's edge, large claw marks evident on its side.": "这条路通向一个小空地，上面有几块参差不齐的岩石构造。一棵倒下的树的树干横跨了溪流的宽度。在溪流的远处，小路继续进入森林。一只受了重伤的小鹿躺在水边喘气，它的身上有明显的大爪子印。",
	"The fawn was recently attacked by one of the elder shadow drakes, but escaped before it was killed. It made it as far as this spot before collapsing.": "这只小鹿最近被一只年长的影子龙攻击，但在被杀之前逃脱了。它在倒下之前一直走到了这个地方。",
	"The tree trunk is roughly 3 feet in diameter and wet, making it slippery. Phosphorescent moss, which gives off an eerie green glow in the low light, covers portions of the tree trunk. A DC 10 {@skill Acrobatics} check is required to walk across the tree trunk without slipping and falling into the rock-filled water below. Those who fall take {@dice 2d6} bludgeoning damage.": "树干的直径大约为3英尺，湿漉漉的，使它很滑。磷光苔藓在微弱的光线下发出阴森的绿光，覆盖了树干的部分区域。要走过树干而不滑落到下面充满岩石的水中，需要进行DC10（%0%）的检查。掉下去的人会受到{@dice 2d6}重击伤害。",
	"The alseids in area 4 likely hear the adventurers' activity in this area and send Tuallia, a young alseid warrior, to silently observe their activities. A DC 15 {@skill Perception} check is necessary to discover him hiding among the trees. If the characters care for the injured animal or show it compassion, Tuallia reveals himself and asks the party to follow him to the alseid encampment (area 4).": "4号区域的阿尔塞德人很可能听到了冒险者在这个区域的活动，并派年轻的阿尔塞德战士图阿利娅悄悄观察他们的活动。要发现躲在树丛中的他，需要进行DC15（%0%）的检查。如果角色们照顾受伤的动物或对它表示同情，图阿利亚就会现身，并要求队伍跟随他到阿尔塞德人的营地（4号区域）。",
	"A swift-running stream winds its way through the forest. Large, jagged rocks and smooth boulders poke up out of the water at odd angles.": "一条湍急的溪流在森林中蜿蜒前行。嶙峋的大石头和光滑的巨石以奇特的角度从水中探出头来。",
	"The steep, 3-foot-tall banks of the stream are rocky, dropping down sharply to the water. The stream is 8 feet deep in most places.": "陡峭的、3英尺高的溪岸是岩石，急剧下降到水中。溪流在大多数地方都有8英尺深。",
	"The water's current is swift: PCs who try to cross to the far bank must succeed on a DC 14 Strength {@skill Athletics} check. Those who fail the check are yanked from their feet, hitting one or more of the rocks in the water and taking {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage.": "水流很湍急。试图渡到远岸的人必须在DC14力量（%0%）的检查中取得成功。检验失败的人将被从他们的脚下拽走，撞上水中的一块或多块岩石并受到{@dice 1d6}重击伤害。",
	"A narrow trail leads to a small, secluded clearing. A small ring of stones contains the remains of a cook fire, and a wooden spear lies on the ground nearby. Small, dried branches that have been hollowed out and tied together with thin cord hang down from a tree limb and clack softly in the breeze.": "一条狭窄的小路通向一个小而隐蔽的空地。一小圈石头上有一个炊火的遗迹，附近的地上躺着一根木制长矛。被挖空并用细绳绑在一起的小干树枝从树枝上垂下，在微风中轻轻地响着。",
	"The few surviving alseids are using this clearing as a temporary camp. The ground is fairly open, with a few large boulders and rock outcroppings. Tuallia leads the six remaining alseids, including one youngling and a critically wounded female.": "少数幸存的阿尔塞德人正在使用这片空地作为临时营地。地面相当开阔，有几块大石头和岩石露头。图阿利娅带领着剩下的六个阿尔塞德人，包括一个幼崽和一个受了重伤的女性。",
	"The alseids can be convinced that the adventurers mean no harm to them or the forest if a character succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma {@skill Persuasion} check, modified up or down based on Tuallia's earlier impression of the party. In such a case, Tuallia recounts the tribe's terrible ordeal and begs the party to destroy the two dragon-like creatures and recover Riatha's body for proper burial. What the alseids do not reveal, however, is that they are desperate to recover the Diadem of Moon and Stars, Riatha's magical crown.": "如果一个角色在DC12魅力（%0%）的检查中成功，那么阿尔塞德人可以相信冒险者对他们和森林没有恶意，并根据图阿利娅之前对队伍的印象进行上下修正。在这种情况下，图阿利娅会讲述部落的可怕遭遇，并恳求队伍消灭这两只龙形生物，收回瑞亚塔的尸体进行妥善安葬。然而，阿尔塞德人没有透露的是，他们急于找回瑞亚塔的魔法冠冕--月亮和星星的冠冕。",
	"The adventurers can take a short rest here. The alseids offer what amenities they can, although this amounts to little more than food and fresh water. Tuallia is proud and brave, but insists on remaining to protect his people—under no circumstances will he accompany the party to the burial mound clearing.": "冒险家们可以在这里进行短暂的休息。阿尔塞德人提供了他们所能提供的便利，尽管这只是食物和淡水而已。图阿利娅骄傲而勇敢，但坚持要留下来保护他的人民--在任何情况下，他都不会陪同队伍前往墓冢空地。",
	"The path through the forest opens into a natural clearing with large and strange rock formations.": "穿过森林的小路通向一个天然空地，那里有巨大而奇怪的岩石构造。",
	"The ground here is muddy; a tangle of fallen branches and deep piles of rotting leaves make it difficult to navigate (treat as difficult terrain).": "这里的地面是泥泞的；落下的树枝纠缠在一起，腐烂的树叶深深地堆积在一起，使人难以驾驭（按困难地形处理）。",
	"The far end of the clearing narrows to form a large, arched opening. Beyond this natural doorway, the adventurers can see a large, earthen mound rising up from the ground.": "空地的远端变窄，形成一个巨大的、拱形的开口。在这个天然的门洞之外，冒险者们可以看到一个巨大的、从地面升起的土丘。",
	"As soon as anyone approaches this arch of trees, a large, tree-like creature emerges from the forest and steps into the opening, blocking the way. Read the following:": "只要有人接近这个树拱，就会有一个像树一样的大型生物从森林中出现，并踏入开口处，挡住去路。阅读以下内容。",
	"A large, living tree with dark, cracked bark steps out of the shadows. Black eyes stare at you intently. Thick, dark, sap runs unchecked like tears down its gnarled face. The strange creature shows no other sign of emotion. It speaks to you in a deep, powerful, monotone voice:": "一棵活生生的大树，树皮漆黑开裂，从阴影中走出来。黑色的眼睛紧紧地盯着你。厚厚的、黑黑的树液像泪水一样顺着它那张长满树瘤的脸肆意流淌。这个奇怪的生物没有表现出其他情绪。它用一种深沉、有力、单调的声音对你说话。",
	"\"The Realms of Shadow have claimed this forest. Leave now or be forever destroyed.\"": "\"影子王国已经占领了这片森林。现在就离开，否则将永远被毁灭。\"",

	"A large, circular clearing lies before you. In its center, an earthen mound, some sixty feet across, rises fifteen feet above the forest floor. The mound is covered with wild flowers and grasses, recently trampled. Well-worn stone steps are cut into the front of the mound. The steps are cracked with age; in a few places they have crumbled away. A ring of standing stones encircles the top of the mound.": "在你面前有一个大的、圆形的空地。在其中心，有一个土堆，宽约60英尺，高出森林地面15英尺。土丘上长满了野花和野草，最近被踩踏过。在土丘的前面凿有磨损严重的石阶。这些台阶因年久而开裂；有几处已经崩塌了。丘顶上有一圈立石。",
	"The steps are precarious in spots, but still serviceable. The mound's slope is easily climbed. The trees are particularly tall and dense around this area, and deep shadows envelop much of the clearing.": "这些台阶有些地方很不稳定，但仍然可以使用。丘陵的斜坡很容易爬上去。这个地区的树木特别高大茂密，空地的大部分被深深的阴影所笼罩。",
	"The clearing is quiet—even the sounds of birds have abruptly ceased. Thick mist swirls and drifts throughout the clearing, filling the air with an ominous and foreboding chill. Characters within the clearing must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for as long as they remain in this area.": "这片空地很安静，甚至连鸟叫声都突然停止了。浓厚的雾气在整个空地上旋转和飘荡，使空气中充满了不祥和不祥的寒意。在这片空地上的人物必须在DC13智慧救赎中获得成功，否则只要他们停留在这个区域，就会被吓到。",
	"Tall standing stones jut out of the ground in the form of an irregularly shaped ring, resembling a misshapen stone claw bursting from the earth. A smaller ring of round rocks can be seen within.": "高大的立石以不规则形状的环状突出地面，类似于从地球上迸发出来的错误的石爪。里面可以看到一个较小的圆石环。",

	"Maalyreth and Shydrageth, two {@creature elder shadow drake|tob 3pp|elder shadow drakes}, lurk in the deep shadows, watching the characters. If the characters move past the stones and toward the pool (area 8), the drakes use Shadow Jump to come down among the PCs and attack!": "Maalyreth和Shydrageth，两个（%0%），潜伏在深深的阴影中，观察着人物。如果角色们越过石头，走向水池（8号区域），德拉克就会使用影子跳跃，从NPC中间下来并进行攻击",

	"The elder shadow drakes use their Speed Surge, Shadow Blend, and Shadow Jump traits to maneuver around the clearing, flanking their enemies and keeping the party off balance whenever possible. Maalyreth often flies above the battle to unleash his stygian breath against PCs in a group, while Shydrageth prefers getting close enough to bite.": "年长的影子龙利用它们的速度突进、影子混合和影子跳跃的特性在空地上机动，从侧面攻击敌人，并尽可能地使队伍失去平衡。马利亚斯（Maalyreth）经常在战斗中飞翔，以释放他的阴森气息来对付群体中的NPC，而塞德拉格思（Shydrageth）则更喜欢靠近，以咬人。",

	"The air around the pool smells fetid and sulfurous.": "游泳池周围的空气散发着腥臭和硫磺味。",
	"The mysterious, swirling cloud of darkness in the pool is a portal to the Plane of Shadow, where the two elder shadow drakes emerged from before they savaged the alseid tribe. Although what lies beyond the portal is beyond the scope of this adventure, it can be used in any way you see fit. The clouds are dense enough to be essentially solid, and a specific, magical command word or phrase is needed to part the blackness.": "水池中神秘的、旋转的黑暗之云是一个通往阴影界的传送门，两位长老的阴影龙在屠杀阿尔塞德部落之前就是从那里出现的。虽然传送门之外的东西超出了这次冒险的范围，但它可以用你认为合适的任何方式来使用。云层足够密集，基本上是实心的，需要一个特定的、神奇的命令词或短语来分开黑气。",

Jagged rocks take up much of the far side of the clearing.": "一条短而窄的小路通向一个小空地。靠近空地入口处的一棵大树的树干上雕刻着精美的藻类和林地动物图像。锯齿状的岩石占据了空地的大部分面积。",

	"Amid the jagged rocks lies the mutilated and partially eaten body of Riatha, the alseid shaman. A gnarled wooden staff with a crystal embedded in the top lies near her body. A delicate crown of woven silver and gold (the Diadem of Moon and Stars) still rests upon her brow.": "在参差不齐的岩石中，躺着阿尔塞德萨满的残缺和部分被吃掉的尸体。在她的尸体旁，躺着一根顶端嵌有水晶的虬曲的木杖。她的额头上还戴着一顶由银和金编织而成的精致王冠（月亮和星星的皇冠）。",

	"If the characters defeat the two elder shadow drakes, they can recover the body of Riatha. If they return Riatha's body to the alseids (including the diadem), they earn the alseids' undying gratitude. Failing to return Riatha's body, or keeping the Diadem, earns the alseids' undying hatred and likely an ambush the next time the party visits the forest.": "如果角色们击败了两只长老级影子龙，他们就能找回瑞亚塔的尸体。如果他们把瑞亚塔的尸体还给阿尔塞德（包括头饰），他们就会得到阿尔塞德不朽的感激。如果没有归还瑞亚塔的尸体，或者没有保管好冠冕，就会招致阿尔塞人不死不休的仇恨，并且很可能在下一次队伍访问森林的时候遭到伏击。",

	"The ruined Umbral Tower rests deep in the forest, in a marshy region avoided by all but songbirds. Long abandoned by its original occupant, the tower features a malfunctioning gate that connects this place and the Plane of Shadow. The site serves as a base for a group of shadow fey hunters and their entourage of hounds and guardians. The hunters used the gate to travel from their home plane, and they now attempt to bag as many trophies and as much loot as possible before returning home when the gate reactivates.": "毁坏的保护塔坐落在森林深处的沼泽地带，除了鸣禽之外，其他人都避之不及。这座塔被原来的居住者长期遗弃，它有一个失灵的门，连接着这个地方和阴影世界。这个地方是一群影子精灵猎人和他们的随行猎犬和守护者的基地。猎人们用这扇门从他们的母体世界出发，现在他们试图在大门重新启动时，在回家之前尽可能多地获得战利品和更多的战利品。",
	"The trade road that skirts the forest has been plagued by bandits and raiders. Unlike regular bandits, however, these bandits don't steal trade goods, instead taking ears and scalps, and none of their victims are left alive.

Next to her is a large hound, the size of a pony, its muzzle frothing and crusted with blood. Two other hulking creatures, looking like oversized goblins, notice your presence, their flat, broad nostrils flaring—both are wounded. With a grunt of warning, the beasts stand and face you, while the elven creature and the hound slip away into the swampy overgrowth.": "然而，这些传言被证明是错误的。当你绕过一个弯道时，商人和卫兵的尸体散落在路上，甚至连草泥马也躺在地上。躲在大屠杀中的是几个阴暗的人物。中间是一个身穿黑色皮衣的精灵。她旁边是一只大猎犬，有一匹小马那么大，它的嘴里流着血，结着痂。另外两个巨大的生物，看起来像超大的地精，注意到了你的存在，它们平坦宽阔的鼻孔翻腾着--都受了伤。随着一声警告的咕噜声，这些野兽站起来面对你，而精灵生物和猎犬则溜进了沼泽地的灌木丛中。",

Most of the writing consists of her plans for avenging various wrongs done to her; her madness is evident.": "{@b The Table}: 哈达的桌子上有许多死灵法术的组件。仔细研究({@skill Investigation}DC14)她的工作表明，她对爆炸的骨头很着迷。仔细检查({@skill Perception}DC14)桌子本身，可以发现一个隐藏的抽屉，里面有一个处理过的骨头{@item +2 weapon|dmg|+2 dagger}，一个{@item spell scroll (3rd level)|dmg}的{@spell animate dead}，两个{@item potion of supreme healing|dmg|potions of supreme healing}，和一本被水弄坏的日记。这本日记描述了哈达想用她的魔法给孤儿们带来比她自己更好的生活的愿望。大部分的文字都是关于她为自己所受的各种委屈复仇的计划；她的疯狂是显而易见的。",
	"When the characters return to the surface, Tallenya is there to pay their fee, assuming all went well. If the characters return with rescued children, payment is made. Given the evidence of ghouls and necromancy, the town authorities order the cistern and tunnel collapsed and Hada's furnishings and remaining items burned.": "当人物回到地面时，塔伦亚会在那里支付他们的费用，前提是一切顺利。如果人物带着获救的孩子回来，就会支付报酬。考虑到食尸鬼和亡灵的证据，镇当局下令关闭蓄水池和隧道，烧掉哈达的家具和剩余物品。",
	"How Hada came to possess the egg of such a terrifying beast remains unknown, but the city would appreciate a group willing to explore deeper into the underworld, perhaps leading to an encounter with the Imperial Ghoul Outpost from this volume or other creatures of the deep earth who knew Hada. If Officer Naragal or any of the imperial ghouls survived, they might also have set a watch on the passages leading here, in anticipation of visitors from the surface.": "哈达是如何拥有这样一个可怕的野兽的蛋的，仍然是个未知数，但城市会感谢一个愿意深入地下世界探索的小组，也许会导致与本卷中的帝国食尸鬼哨所或其他认识哈达的深地生物的相遇。如果纳拉格尔警官或任何一个帝国食尸鬼幸存下来，他们也可能在通往这里的通道上设置了监视，以期待来自地面的访客。",
	"Fane of Serpents is a titanoboa lair suitable for three to five 10th-level characters.": "蛇之巢是一个适合三到五个10级人物的泰坦博亚巢穴。",
	"A rocky butte covered with soaring ruins looms over the landscape. Legend describes it as a monument raised by an inhuman race that was wiped out centuries ago as retribution over foul practices. Locally, the spot is known as Titan's Height. It rises starkly above the surrounding area, with four terraced plateaus. Each level is covered with the ruins of many-columned halls in an architectural style unlike anything else in the area. Their age and strangeness alone are enough to generate fearful legends. The stories grow worse when travelers or livestock disappear near Titan's Height, which they sometimes do.": "一座布满高耸废墟的岩石山丘耸立在风景中。传说它是一个非人类种族建立的纪念碑，该种族在几个世纪前被消灭，作为对肮脏行为的报复。在当地，这个地方被称为泰坦之巅。它鲜明地耸立在周围地区之上，有四个阶梯状的高原。每一层都覆盖着多柱式大厅的废墟，其建筑风格与该地区其他任何地方都不同。仅仅是它们的年龄和怪异程度就足以产生可怕的传说。当旅行者或牲畜在泰坦之巅附近消失时，这些故事就会变得更加糟糕，而他们有时确实如此。",
	"Of course, travelers get lost or waylaid by bandits all the time, and livestock that isn't watched has a tendency to wander off, fall into ravines, and be poached by lions or wyverns. As natural philosophers and less superstitious merchants tell their neighbors in the inns and markets of the region, none of these occurrences prove that anything malevolent lurks around Titan's Height.": "当然，旅行者经常迷路或被强盗拦截，没有人看管的牲畜也有走失的趋势，掉进山谷，被狮子或狼獾偷猎。正如自然哲学家和不太迷信的商人在该地区的旅店和市场上告诉他们的邻居的那样，这些事件都不能证明泰坦之巅周围潜伏着任何邪恶的东西。",
	"But, in fact, something does. It's a titanoboa, a serpent of enormous size and age. Like a dragon, it spends most of its time asleep in a den beneath the ruins, emerging infrequently when hunger awakens it. Then it slithers down from the ruins and devours a few camels and goats, or a tent full of unwary travelers, before returning to its den to slumber for months.": "但是，事实上，有些东西确实如此。它是一条泰坦罗波亚，一条体型巨大、年龄巨大的蛇。像龙一样，它大部分时间都在废墟下的巢穴里睡觉，当饥饿唤醒它时，它才会经常出现。然后，它从废墟上滑下来，吃掉几只骆驼和山羊，或一顶帐篷，里面装满了不知情的旅行者，然后再回到它的洞穴里沉睡几个月。",
	"The gigantic snake is not alone. It has attracted a small number of secretive lizardfolk admirers that live furtively among the ruins and call the snake Thont‐Aisk, the monument crusher. A few months ago, a band of adventurers came to investigate the place, attracted by the same legends and rumors that now draw the PCs. Their leader, a mage named Karakin Aram, recognized a situation ripe for exploitation. The adventurers killed the lizardfolk leader and forced the others to obey them through intimidation and promises of power. Now Aram seeks a way to fully control the titanoboa.": "这条巨大的蛇并不孤单。它吸引了一小部分神秘的蜥蜴人崇拜者，他们鬼鬼祟祟地生活在废墟中，称这条蛇为Thont-Aisk，即纪念碑粉碎者。几个月前，一队冒险家来调查这个地方，他们被现在吸引NPC的同样的传说和传言所吸引。他们的领袖，一个名叫卡拉金-阿拉姆的法师，认识到了一个已经成熟的利用形势。冒险者们杀死了蜥蜴人首领，并通过恐吓和权力的承诺迫使其他人服从他们。现在，阿拉姆寻求一种完全控制泰坦博亚的方法。",
	"Titan's Height has the usual allure of abandoned places: mystery, adventure, and the potential to claim ancient weapons, gold, jewels, and magic. If that's not enough, any of the following enticements can be dangled in front of the characters.": "泰坦之巅具有被遗弃之地的惯有诱惑力：神秘、冒险，以及有可能获得古代武器、黄金、珠宝和魔法。如果这还不够，以下任何一种诱惑都可以在人物面前晃来晃去。",
	"This has always been a perilous region for travelers, but recent attacks have created a mystery. Small caravans of people and pack animals have been wiped out, while their goods were left behind untouched.": "对旅行者来说，这里一直是一个危险的地区，但最近的袭击造成了一个谜团。由人和牲畜组成的小型商队被消灭了，而他们的货物却没有受到任何影响。",
	"The glow of a campfire was seen on Titan's Height. Bandits have used the place as a hideout in the past, so the local ruler offers a small payment to anyone willing to investigate, with the promise of a more significant reward if bandits are found and destroyed.": "在泰坦之巅看到了篝火的光亮。土匪过去曾把这里作为藏身之处，所以当地统治者向任何愿意调查的人提供小额报酬，并承诺如果找到并消灭土匪，会有更多的奖励。",
	"A lone adventurer tells of encountering a strange force near Titan's Height. Something clouded the minds of his companions and turned them against each other. He alone escaped. (This incident was the work of the lizardfolk, occurring before Aram arrived.)": "一个孤独的冒险家讲述了他在泰坦之巅附近遇到了一股奇怪的力量。有什么东西蒙蔽了他的同伴们的头脑，使他们彼此对立。只有他一个人逃了出来。(这一事件是蜥蜴人的杰作，发生在阿拉姆到达之前）。",
	"Most titanoboas live in jungle areas, and Titan's Height is right at home in that environment. In a jungle setting, the ruins are heavily overgrown with creepers, vines, and trees. The plateau can just as easily rise above the desert, provided enough travelers pass through the area to keep the gigantic snake fed.": "大多数泰坦巨人生活在丛林地区，而泰坦之巅就在这种环境中。在丛林环境中，废墟上长满了爬山虎、藤蔓和树木。只要有足够多的旅行者经过该地区，让巨大的蛇吃饱，高原就可以轻易地升到沙漠之上。",
	"The lizardfolk watch the surrounding territory closely, on Aram's orders. Except for invisible creatures, nothing can approach Titan's Height without the lizardfolk noticing and alerting Aram.": "根据阿拉姆的命令，蜥蜴人密切监视着周围的领土。除了看不见的生物，没有任何东西可以在蜥蜴人没有注意到并提醒阿拉姆的情况下接近泰坦之巅。",
	"The sides of the prominence are sheer, but they can be climbed normally. The lizardfolk won't allow climbers to ascend unmolested. They attack with javelins and bows, and by rolling large stones down onto the climbers' heads.": "突出部的两侧是峭壁，但可以正常攀登。蜥蜴人不允许登山者不受干扰地攀登。他们用标枪和弓箭攻击，并将大石头滚落到攀登者的头上。",
	"{@b Ramps}: The ramps are less steep than stairs but steeper than most ramps. For every 10 feet of horizontal distance a ramp covers (one square on the map), it rises (or descends) 5 feet. Most ramps have landings at the halfway point. The four levels of the plateau are 20, 40, 60, and 80 feet above ground level. The sides of the ramps are crumbling, but the ramps are otherwise sound.": "{@b Ramps}: 坡道没有楼梯那么陡峭，但比大多数坡道更陡峭。坡道每覆盖10英尺的水平距离（地图上的一个方块），就会上升（或下降）5英尺。大多数坡道在半山腰处有落脚点。高地的四个层次分别是离地面20、40、60和80英尺。坡道的两侧摇摇欲坠，但坡道在其他方面是健全的。",
	"{@b Terraces}: The plateaus were artificially leveled and paved with flat stones when the structures were built. Most of the paving is intact, except where trees have taken root and forced the stones aside. The four terraces together cover one and a half acres.": "{@b Terraces}: 在建造这些建筑时，高原被人为地削平，并铺上了平坦的石头。除了树木扎根并将石头逼到一边的地方，大部分的铺设都是完好无损的。四个台地共占地1.5英亩。",
	"{@b Structures}: These massive, close-fitted stones are covered with carvings. The depictions are geometric, with no discernible writing or pictures to give them historical context. None of the structures have roofs, and it appears they never did.": "{@b Structures}: 这些巨大的、贴身的石头上布满了雕刻。描绘的是几何图形，没有明显的文字或图片来说明其历史背景。这些结构都没有屋顶，而且似乎从来没有过。",
	"The structures are still sound, although they might not look it. Many stones have toppled from the walls and columns, sometimes creating rubble piles that spill onto the level below.": "这些结构仍然是健全的，尽管它们可能看起来不是这样。许多石头从墙上和柱子上掉下来，有时会形成碎石堆，洒落在下面的楼层。",
	"The \"walls\" of the structures are riddled with openings and gaps. These barriers are more substantial than rows of columns, but they're pierced by many openings wide enough for a Medium creature to step through. Because of their age, it isn't obvious that these openings are design features and not the result of collapse. Dwarves recognize the difference immediately.": "这些结构的 \"墙 \"布满了开口和缝隙。这些障碍物比一排排的柱子更坚固，但它们被许多开口刺穿，宽度足以让一个中等生物跨过。由于年代久远，这些开口并不明显，是设计上的特点，而不是坍塌的结果。矮人立即意识到了其中的差别。",
	"If you've placed Titan's Height outside the jungle, modify the following description accordingly.": "如果你把泰坦的高度放在丛林之外，请相应地修改以下描述。",
	"The rocky prominence rises like a fortress above the jungle. Four flat levels are stacked atop each other like layers of a cake. The lowest level is twenty feet above the forest floor, and the highest rises at least eighty feet overhead. Titanic ruins stand on each level—roofless structures of columns and open walls. Ramps with occasional platforms connect the levels. Vines and creepers grow over everything, but not even the insistent forest could overpower this ancient bastion.": "岩石的突出部分像一座堡垒一样耸立在丛林之上。四个平坦的楼层相互叠加，就像蛋糕的一层。最低的一层离森林地面有20英尺高，而最高的一层至少有80英尺高。每一层都矗立着泰坦尼克号废墟--由柱子和开放的墙壁组成的无顶结构。偶尔有平台的坡道连接着各层。藤蔓和爬山虎长满了一切，但即使是顽固的森林也无法压倒这个古老的堡垒。",
	"No matter how characters ascend the mound (unless they're invisible), they'll be observed by lizardfolk, who immediately inform Aram that they have intruders.": "无论人物如何登上土丘（除非他们是隐形的），他们都会被蜥蜴人观察到，他们会立即通知阿拉姆他们有入侵者。",
	"A leather bucket is perched at the edge of what looks like a well inside this crumbling structure. A rope made from braided vines is tied to the bucket, with most of its length coiled on the floor.": "在这个摇摇欲坠的建筑内，一个皮桶栖息在看起来像井的边缘。一根用藤蔓编织而成的绳子绑在桶上，其大部分长度盘绕在地板上。",

	"The lizardfolk that remain on the plateau use this crumbling temple as their dwelling. The basket holds their next meal—five dead birds and a mostly dead rat. The twelve {@creature lizardfolk|mm} hide behind the temple (or wherever they can) and attack when most of the characters are inside the structure. They shoot their bows through gaps in the walls, gaining three-quarters cover from the stonework. When half are dead, the others flee.": "留在高原上的蜥蜴人将这座破败的寺庙作为他们的住所。篮子里装着他们的下一顿饭--五只死鸟和一只大部分死亡的老鼠。十二个蜥蜴人（%0%）躲在神庙后面（或任何可以躲避的地方），当大多数角色都在结构内时，他们就会发动攻击。他们从墙壁的缝隙中射出弓箭，从石缝中获得四分之三的掩护。当一半人死亡时，其他人就会逃跑。",
	"Aside from an immense heap of rubble where part of the cliff and stonework above has collapsed, this structure is largely intact. A few broken pots are scattered on the paving stones, but the feature that dominates the level is the great ramp that leads straight up to the higher landing. The surrounding walls enclose the ramp.": "除了上面的悬崖和石块部分坍塌的巨大碎石堆之外，这个结构基本上是完好无损的。铺路石上散落着一些破碎的盆子，但主导这一层的特征是直达较高楼层的巨大坡道。周围的墙壁将坡道围了起来。",

	"Two irregular passages that connect to Thont-Aisk's den are hidden behind heaps of rubble and foliage. The rubble is a mix of collapsed masonry and pieces of the cliff that have sheared off over the centuries. Rubble-filled squares on the map are extremely difficult terrain: every 1 foot of movement uses 4 feet of the moving creature's speed.": "两条连接通泰-艾斯克巢穴的不规则通道隐藏在成堆的瓦砾和树叶后面。这些瓦砾是由倒塌的砖石和几个世纪以来剪切下来的悬崖碎片组成的。地图上充满瓦砾的方块是极其困难的地形：每移动1英尺就会消耗移动生物的4英尺速度。",
	"The titanoboa doesn't use these exits often, so the areas show few signs of disturbance. The openings can be found with a physical search of the immediate area—climbing over the rubble and pushing aside thorn bushes—but not by scanning it from 10 or 15 feet away.": "泰坦罗伯亚不经常使用这些出口，所以这些地方很少有被打扰的痕迹。通过对附近区域的物理搜索，可以找到这些开口，爬过碎石，推开荆棘丛，但不能从10或15英尺外扫描。",
	"Three rows of columns run lengthwise through this hall. Those on the outside are as high as the walls, and those running down the center are only five feet high.": "三排柱子纵向贯穿这个大厅。外面的柱子和墙壁一样高，而中间的柱子只有五英尺高。",
	"At the height of this temple's glory, the setting sun on the spring and autumn equinoxes shone exactly along the row of low pillars, squarely illuminating the great head in area 6, and the shadows of the pillars created the illusion that the head was floating. Curious characters can figure this out with a successful DC 15 Intelligence {@skill Nature} or {@skill Religion} check.": "在这座寺庙最辉煌的时候，春分和秋分的夕阳正好沿着一排低矮的柱子照耀，正对着6号区域的大头，柱子的阴影造成了大头漂浮的错觉。好奇的人物可以通过成功的DC15智力（%0%）或（%1%）检查来弄清这一点。",
	"A massive, crumbling, stone head lies toppled on the paving stones of this structure. The features of the face suggest a humanoid creature, but they're elongated in a way that you've never seen on any humanoid. It might be nothing more than a surreal and unsettling artistic style, or this face could represent a race that died out long ago.": "一个巨大的、摇摇欲坠的石头倒在这个结构的铺路石上。这张脸的特征表明是一个人形生物，但它们被拉长的方式是你从未在任何人形生物上看到过的。这可能只不过是一种超现实的、令人不安的艺术风格，或者这张脸可能代表了一个很久以前就灭绝的种族。",

The head is one of the ramag (see Unlikely Heroes for 5th Edition), an obscure race of portal-building humanoids that rarely leave their magical cities and planar redoubts.": "除了那颗巨大的头颅之外，这座神庙没有任何特征。这个头颅是拉玛格人（见第五版《不可能的英雄》），这是一个不知名的建造传送门的人类种族，他们很少离开他们的魔法城市和平面堡垒。",

	"The walls of this enclosure are thick and solid, unlike those on the levels below. An immense, two-tiered dais fills the area. Columns covered with geometric designs stand symmetrically on the platforms, and a ramp leads from the entrance straight up to the top level.": "这个围墙很厚，很坚固，与下面几层不同。一个巨大的、两层的台子充满了整个区域。覆盖着几何图案的柱子对称地矗立在平台上，一条坡道从入口处直达顶层。",
	"The lower level of the platform is 10 feet above the floor, and the upper level is 20 feet above the floor. At the center of the upper platform, an open pit plunges 50 feet down into a dark cavern. A strong animal smell wafts up from the pit. The sides of the cavity are curiously rippled in a deep, wavelike pattern; the indentations allow the titanoboa to slither up the walls of the shaft. Thont-Aisk will climb up from its den in {@dice 2d4} rounds if the lip of the pit is struck hard with a metallic object at least three times. This is how Aram summons the serpent.": "平台的下层离地面有10英尺高，上层离地面有20英尺高。在上层平台的中心，一个敞开的坑落下50英尺，进入一个黑暗的洞穴。一股强烈的动物气味从坑里飘了上来。洞穴的两侧有奇怪的波纹，呈深邃的波浪状；这些压痕使泰坦布阿斯克可以在井壁上滑行。如果用金属物品用力敲击坑唇至少三次，通天蜥就会在{@dice 2d4}回合内从它的巢穴中爬上来。这就是阿拉姆召唤大蛇的方法。",

	"The cavern is featureless except for stalagmites, stalactites, and the bones of the titanoboa's victims, accumulated over the centuries of the snake's life span. The floor of the cavern is difficult terrain for characters but not for Thont-Aisk. A 1-hour search among the bones reveals a stiff, moldering rucksack containing 700 gp, 10 pp, and some rotted paper. A second hour of searching uncovers a small wooden box containing 800 sp plus an opal-studded bracelet worth 50 gp, and a third hour uncovers a potion of flying and an electrum necklace worth 150 gp. No more treasure will be found after three hours.": "除了石笋、钟乳石和泰坦罗波亚的受害者的骨头之外，这个洞穴毫无特色，这些骨头是在蛇的几百年的寿命中积累起来的。洞穴的地面对人物来说是困难的地形，但对Thont-Aisk来说不是。在骨头中搜索1小时后，发现了一个僵硬的、发霉的背包，里面有700戈比、10 pp和一些腐烂的纸张。第二个小时的搜索发现了一个小木箱，里面有800英镑和一个镶有蛋白石的手镯，价值50英镑，第三个小时发现了一个飞行药水和一条价值150英镑的电子琴项链。三小时后就再也找不到宝物了。",

	"These adventurers intend to ambush and kill the intruding PCs. They drink their potions just before entering combat. They attack as PCs explore the third level. Their most likely deployment puts Avetis nearest the enemy, Zhirayr poised to take to the air and attack enemy spellcasters, and Aram at the top of the ramp to level 4, where he can throw a few spells down into the intruders before racing back to the pit to summon Thont-Aisk. These NPCs are experienced pros, however, so they adapt their deployment and tactics to the situation. One might even engage the player characters in conversation to suss out their strengths or lure them into a trap (but the speaker won't be Aram).": "这些冒险者打算伏击并杀死入侵的NPC。他们在进入战斗前喝下他们的药水。他们在NPC探索第三层的时候发动攻击。他们最可能的部署是让阿维提斯离敌人最近，Zhirayr准备在空中攻击敌人的施法者，而Aram在通往第四层的斜坡顶端，在那里他可以向入侵者扔几个法术，然后再跑回坑里去召唤Thont-Aisk。不过，这些NPC都是经验丰富的专家，所以他们会根据情况调整自己的部署和战术。其中一个甚至可能与玩家角色进行对话，以了解他们的实力或引诱他们进入陷阱（但说话的人不会是阿拉姆）。",
	"Whether the NPCs are winning or losing the battle, eventually Aram strikes the edge of the pit to summon Thont-Aisk. The {@creature titanoboa|tob 3pp} arrives {@dice 2d4} rounds later, on its own initiative count. It won't attack Aram (because of his {@item potion of animal friendship|dmg}), but the other NPCs and player characters are equally appealing meals in its eyes. Typically, the giant snake attacks the closest target, but you can also select its victim randomly or choose the target that offers the most drama.": "无论NPC在战斗中是赢是输，最终阿拉姆都会冲击坑的边缘，召唤出通天塔-艾斯克。这只{@creature titanoboa|tob 3pp}在{@dice 2d4}回合后到达，是它自己主动数的。它不会攻击阿拉姆（因为他的（%2%）），但其他NPC和玩家角色在它眼里同样是吸引人的大餐。通常情况下，巨蛇会攻击离它最近的目标，但你也可以随机选择它的受害者，或者选择最能提供戏剧性的目标。",

	"For as long as any dragon can remember, the stairs of Beldestan have been a site of pilgrimage, a direct route from dusty earth up to the heavens, where enormous creatures soar and carry sacrifices up to the gods. Its base is well known for the efficacy of the invocations offered there, but very few other than the most faithful dare venture up the stairs themselves: enormous eagles, howling winds, and various inimical undead make the stairs a place that few find congenial for long.": "从任何龙的记忆中，贝尔德斯坦的楼梯一直是一个朝圣的地方，是一条从尘土飞扬的大地到天堂的直接通道，巨大的生物在那里翱翔，并把祭品送到神的面前。它的基地因其所提供的召唤物的功效而闻名，但除了最忠实的人之外，很少有人敢于冒险登上楼梯：巨大的鹰、呼啸的风和各种有害的不死生物使楼梯成为一个很少有人能长期发现的地方。",
	"Those who climb the full height and return, however, are favored in the eyes of the gods, and certainly accomplishing such a feat is a daring and worthy endeavor. Many have set off for the heights, and but a few have returned, somewhat scarred and sometimes wiser for the effort.": "然而，那些爬满高度并返回的人在神的眼里是受宠的，当然，完成这样的壮举是一种大胆和值得的努力。许多人向高处出发，但也有少数人回来了，他们有些伤痕累累，有时却因努力而变得更加聪明。",

In those same areas, cold spells are more potent: reroll any damage die that comes up a 1.": "攀登贝尔德斯坦的台阶是一种对抗地心引力的残酷攀登：从一个丘陵基地到五英里高的稀薄而冰冷的空气，超过31,000英尺高。由于缺乏空气，所有火系法术在7-11号遭遇区的伤害都会受到惩罚：丢弃所有本来可以造成最大伤害的骰子。在这些地区，寒冷法术的威力更大：重掷任何出现1的伤害骰子。",

	"{@b Flying Time}: Flying to the top of the stairs is entirely possible, and is an easier way to reach the top in heavy armor or with a load of supplies. Flying up must be done in stages of about 10 minutes flight time, due to the limitations of the {@spell fly} spell. This means flying to the top takes seven castings of the spell (if the caster can target all party members), and each casting moves the party up a little less than a mile.

Touching either door triggers a gust of wind spell, which pushes intruders who fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw off the bridge. The fall to earth results in {@dice 20d6} falling damage; the use of any flying or teleportation magic avoids the damage.

All intruders are met with a blast of stellar flare breath while climbing up to the ledge or flying to it—but the dragon doesn't stay there for long.

	"If the PCs kill Yrsinestra, her mate Astraxis is motivated to seek them out, ideally with a company of twenty noctiny minions, its monoliths and mi-go, and whatever other survivors it can muster from the citadel. If the characters decide to turn the citadel into a fortress of their own, one of the living stars of the Court of a Million Stars will visit within three months, inquiring about their right to hold the property and suggesting that they declare their fealty to the Court. But that is another adventure entirely.": "如果NPC杀死了Yrsinestra，她的伴侣Astraxis就会被激励着去寻找他们，最好是带着20个夜行者爪牙、它的巨石和mi-go，以及它能从城堡中召集的任何其他幸存者。如果这些角色决定将城堡变成他们自己的堡垒，那么百万星辰法庭的一位活星人将在三个月内来访，询问他们是否有权持有该财产，并建议他们向法庭宣誓效忠。但这完全是另一次冒险。",

	"The tower is a strange, windowless structure.

Lungs and intestines serve as pipes, teeth become keys, and bones become foot pedals. When the organ is played, the decaying heads mounted over the keyboard scream. The soul organ moves the tower swiftly through the planes and protects it from divinations and other locating spells. In this way Caragorn has stayed one step ahead of Zenobia. Caragorn, Philadon, and Marzel all know how to operate the device, but anyone else must make a successful DC 30 Intelligence (Arcana) check to operate it correctly. The organ is fairly fragile (AC 10, 30 hit points) but can be repaired using fresh corpses—again, an easy task for Marzel, Caragorn or Philadon, but nearly impossible (DC 30 {@skill Arcana}) for others.": "灵魂器官是菲拉登开发的一种魔法装置，由吸血鬼的力量耗尽的受害者的尸体制成。它看起来像一个由闪闪发光的鲜肉制成的大型教堂风琴。肺和肠子作为管道，牙齿成为钥匙，骨头成为脚踏板。当管风琴被演奏时，安装在键盘上的腐烂的头颅会发出尖叫。灵魂管风琴使塔在各个星球上迅速移动，并保护它不受占卜和其他定位法术的影响。通过这种方式，卡拉贡一直比泽诺比亚领先一步。Caragorn、Philadon和Marzel都知道如何操作这个装置，但其他人必须成功地进行DC 30智力（Arcana）检查才能正确操作它。这个器官相当脆弱（AC10，30点命中率），但可以用新鲜的尸体进行修复--同样，对马泽尔、卡拉贡或菲拉顿来说是个简单的任务，但对其他人来说几乎不可能（DC30（%0%））。",
	"If the heroes attempt to use the organ, the two umbral vampires in area 8 will be warned and prepared for invaders. If no attack comes within a half-hour, they come down into the ballroom, ready for a fight. If Marzel is still alive when the organ is used improperly, he comes immediately, bringing his hounds of the night.": "如果英雄们试图使用风琴，8号区域的两个骨灰级吸血鬼将被警告并准备迎接入侵者。如果半小时内没有攻击，他们就会下到舞厅里，准备战斗。如果风琴被不当使用时，马泽尔还活着，他就会立即带着他的夜行猎犬前来。",
	"The staircase twists up to another large room, dominated by a great wrought iron bed frame facing a glassed-in balcony to the south. Cushions litter the floor, and diaphanous dark curtains hang from the ceiling. A love seat is positioned along one wall, and a set of large, high-backed chairs frame a chess table on the other. A harp made of the bones is positioned next to an ornate hookah. Tattered books and scrolls are piled on and around the love seat and the cushions. Ancient swords hang on the walls, and suggestive sculptures writhe in the corner. Weapons hang from the walls, interspersed with bookcases straining under the weight of chained books.": "楼梯蜿蜒而上，通向另一个大房间，由一个巨大的锻铁床架主导，面向南方的玻璃阳台。地板上铺着坐垫，天花板上挂着薄薄的深色窗帘。一面墙上摆放着一张爱情座椅，另一面墙上摆放着一组高背大椅，上面摆放着一张象棋桌。一把由骨头制成的竖琴被放置在一个华丽的水烟机旁边。破旧的书籍和卷轴堆放在爱情座椅和坐垫上及周围。墙上挂着古代的剑，角落里有暗示性的雕塑在蠕动。墙上挂着武器，中间穿插着书柜，在铁链书籍的重压下，显得格外紧张。",
	"Beyond the balcony is the vista of a great city wrapped in dark fog. Huge, twisted towers loom out the murk, and a darker shape floats by the window. It has the size and dimensions of a whale, recognizable as a living thing only because of its multiple baleful red eyes.": "阳台外是一个被黑雾包裹着的巨大城市的景象。巨大的、扭曲的塔楼在黑暗中若隐若现，一个更黑暗的形状漂浮在窗边。它有鲸鱼的大小和尺寸，只有在它有多只可怕的红眼睛的情况下，才可以认出它是一个活物。",
	"Unless they are summoned elsewhere, Caragorn and Philadon are lounging here. They wear the tattered remains of the fine raiment seen in the portraits earlier. They are not receiving visitors at the moment": "除非他们被召唤到其他地方，否则卡拉贡和菲拉顿就在这里闲逛。他们穿着先前在画像中看到的精美衣服的破烂残骸。他们目前没有接待访客",
	"Both {@creature umbral vampire|tob 3pp|umbral vampires} cast mirror image at once, then black tentacles. Only after attempting to restrain their opponents do they use their umbral grasp. They will use shadow blend, then strike for maximum efficiency.": "两人（%0%）同时施展镜像，然后是黑色触手。只有在试图克制对手之后，他们才会使用嗯哼式的抓捕。他们会使用影子混合，然后进行攻击以获得最大效率。",
	"Three rounds after combat begins with the two male umbral vampires, Zenobia, the third side of this romantic triangle, arrives. If the heroes have not dealt with Marzel, she will be at half strength (42 hit points) from her battle with the attendant. She calls Caragorn all sorts of names (Incubus! Tempter! Seducer!) and Philadon as well (Philanderer! Faithless! Betrayer!), but will attack the heroes first, deciding to sort out her differences with Philadon and Caragorn later.": "在与两个男性嗯哼吸血鬼的战斗开始后的三个回合，泽诺比亚，这个浪漫三角的第三方，来到了。如果英雄们没有对付马泽尔，她将在与随从的战斗中处于半力（42点命中率）。她叫卡拉贡各种名字（Incubus！Tempter！Seducer！），也叫Philadon（Philanderer！Faithless！Betrayer！），但会先攻击英雄们，决定以后再解决她与Philadon和卡拉贡的分歧。",
	"The balcony over the City Fallen into Shadow might be an illusory projection, or a true portal into that realm (at the DM's option). If the former, dealing 20 damage to the illusion disrupts it. If the latter, breaking the window (again, by dealing 20 damage) moves the entire tower bodily into the tenebral plane of shadow. The huge creature is a peaceful native of shadow, and would have the statistics of a whale, but other natives are not as kindly.": "坠入阴影之城的阳台可能是一个虚幻的投影，也可能是进入那个领域的真正入口（由DM选择）。如果是前者，对幻象造成20点伤害就可以破坏它。如果是后者，打碎窗户（同样是造成20点伤害）就可以把整个塔身移到阴影的十倍区。这个巨大的生物是一个和平的影子原住民，会有鲸鱼的统计数据，但其他原住民就不那么友善了。",
	"The two small rooms off the bedroom (8a and 8b) are a bath and a closet. The bath is dominated by a large tub filled with shadows and blood. The closet is filled with ragged and archaic finery from all eras. It includes a cloak of displacement attuned to Philadon, and an arrow-catching shield attuned to Caragorn. They will equip these items if they suspect interlopers are in the tower. Also among the uniforms is a {@item bag of devouring|dmg}.": "卧室外的两个小房间（8a和8b）是一个浴室和一个壁橱。浴室以一个充满阴影和血迹的大浴缸为主。壁橱里摆满了各个时代的破旧的装饰品。其中包括一件与费拉顿相配的位移斗篷，以及与卡拉贡相配的接箭盾。如果他们怀疑塔内有入侵者，就会装备这些物品。在这些制服中还有一件（%0%）。",
	"Destroying the soul organ traps the tower in its present location, and the tower loses both its magical nature and its baleful influence.": "摧毁灵魂器官会将塔困在它现在的位置，而塔会失去它的魔法性质和它的邪恶影响。",
	"Breaking the balcony window on the top floor ends the illusion, or propels the tower into the Plane of Shadow itself, with consequences beyond the scope of this adventure.": "打破顶层的阳台窗户可以结束这个幻觉，或者将塔楼推入阴影界本身，其后果超出本冒险的范围。",
	"The harp, the hookah, and six of the writhing stone statues can be sold for 250 gp each. The weapons on the wall are of archaic design, but nonmagical. The books are all in Void Speech and other esoteric languages and deal with magical theory, and the eight most usable can be sold for 250 gp each.": "竖琴、水烟机和六个扭动的石像可以以每个250金币的价格出售。墙上的武器都是古老的设计，但不是魔法的。这些书都是用虚空之语和其他深奥的语言写成的，涉及魔法理论，其中最有用的八本可以以每本250金币的价格出售。",
	"Zenobia is outraged at both Caragorn and Philadon, but will take out the heroes first to clear the battlefield. If the characters choose to flee, only then will the jealous umbral vampires fall on each other.": "泽诺比亚对卡拉贡和菲拉顿都很愤怒，但会先干掉英雄们以清理战场。如果角色们选择逃离，那么嫉妒的嗯哼吸血鬼们才会互相倾轧。",
	"This wand of petrified wood has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1, 2, or 3 of its charges to deal {@dice 2d8} necrotic damage per charge to a plant or a plant creature within 30 feet. A successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw halves the damage.": "这根石化木的魔杖有7个电荷。拿着它的时候，你可以使用一个动作，消耗它的1、2或3个电荷，对30英尺内的植物或植物生物造成每次电荷量为0%的坏死伤害。成功的DC 15宪法救赎可以使伤害减半。",
	"The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand shatters and is destroyed.": "魔杖每天在黎明时分重新获得1d6+1个已消耗的电荷。如果你消耗了魔杖的最后一次充能，请掷一个D20。如果是1，魔杖就会碎裂并被摧毁。",
	"Carved from pearlescent stone, these knitting needles resemble two long, spindly fingers. Their tips are sharp.": "这些织针由珠光石雕刻而成，类似于两根长长的刺状手指。它们的尖端很锋利。",
	"These crimson red knitting needles are made from blood-infused coral. They can be used to cast {@spell grasping vine} in a particular location. If the effect is strengthened by the addition of blood to the casting as a material component, the vine lasts for 1 week per level of the user, and the vines regenerate within 1 hour if cut. All such vines in an area are linked to a single knotted reed; if that knot is cut, all the reeds created by the needles wither in a few minutes. A caster using the needles can choose to stitch together a reedling (treat as a NE {@creature child of the briar|tob 3pp}), which serves the caster willingly. In addition to the listed effects, targets affected by the needles' ability take 5 piercing damage. Once the needles have been used, they cannot be used again until midnight.": "这些深红色的织针是由注入血液的珊瑚制成。它们可以用来在一个特定的位置施放（%0%）。如果在施法过程中加入血液作为材料成分，效果会得到加强，藤蔓在使用者的每一级中持续1周，如果被切断，藤蔓会在1小时内再生。一个区域内的所有此类藤蔓都与一个打结的芦苇相连；如果这个结被切断，所有由针刺产生的芦苇都会在几分钟内枯萎。使用针的施法者可以选择缝合一根芦苇（视作NE（1%）），这根芦苇愿意为施法者服务。除了列出的效果外，受针刺能力影响的目标会受到5次穿刺伤害。一旦针被使用，在午夜之前不能再次使用。",
	"This trap hurls several javelins to a range of 50 feet.": "这个陷阱会投掷几个标枪，射程为50英尺。",
