	"People have been disappearing at night in the city of Silverymoon. Some vanish entirely, leaving behind whispered rumors of fiends or other evil creatures having spirited them away. Others return strangely altered, with their memories of having been kidnapped wiped clean and their minds strangely dulled—and always with remarkable haircuts.": "在银月城的夜晚，人们一直在消失。有些人完全消失了，留下了关于恶魔或其他邪恶生物将他们带走的低声传言。另一些人回来后则发生了奇怪的变化，他们被绑架的记忆被抹去了，他们的头脑也奇怪地变迟钝了，而且总是剪着引人注目的头发。",

	"Despite its title (a pun on the opera {@i The Barber of Seville}), this adventure can be set in any settlement of the DM's choice. But beware-this scenario might end with the player characters transformed in strange and permanent ways! Any such transformative effects (including the potent magic of the {@i Prismatic Coloring Machine}) are the purview of the DM, who is free to modify those effects or make them temporary as desired.": "尽管它的标题是（对歌剧的双关语{@i The Barber of Seville}），这个冒险可以设置在DM选择的任何定居点。但要注意--这个场景可能会以玩家角色以奇怪和永久的方式转变而告终！任何这样的转变效果（包括{@i Prismatic Coloring Machine}的强大魔法），都会使玩家的角色变得更加强大。任何这样的转变效果（包括{@i Prismatic Coloring Machine}的强大魔法）都是DM的权限，他可以根据需要自由地修改这些效果或使其成为暂时的。",
	"Jooge Nopsmoth, a talented barber, has long lived in Silverymoon with his daughter, Mops. The two have always been happy, even after the death of Jooge's wife, Giselle, a few years ago-except that Jooge has no head for money and an excessive desire to experiment with new barbering techniques. One day, Jooge gave a haircut to a wandering {@creature Korred|vgm} named Bezoar. That strange fey creature became his regular customer, always coming to Jooge for cuts.": "Jooge Nopsmoth，一个有天赋的理发师，和他的女儿Mops长期生活在Silverymoon。两人一直很幸福，即使在几年前Jooge的妻子Giselle去世后也是如此--只是Jooge对钱没有头绪，而且过度渴望尝试新的理发技术。有一天，Jooge给一个名叫Bezoar的流浪者（%0）理了发。那个奇怪的精灵生物成了他的常客，总是来找Jooge理发。",
	"Jooge was able to earn a bit of extra money by selling art objects made from Bezoar's hair cuttings, which the korred's magical nature transformed into the same high-quality steel as Jooge's scissors. Still, it wasn't nearly enough for him to be able to afford the {@creature flail snail|vgm} he saw offered for sale from a passing caravan. Jooge suspected correctly that the flail snail's colorful secretions could be used to make brilliant hair dyes, so he borrowed money from {@creature darkling|vgm} moneylenders to be able to afford the wondrous creature.": "Jooge能够通过出售用Bezoar的头发剪下来的艺术品来赚取一点额外的钱，Korred的神奇性质将其转化为与Jooge的剪刀一样的高质量钢铁。不过，这对他来说还远远不够，他看到一个路过的商队提供出售的（%0%）。Jooge正确地猜测到耀眼的蜗牛的彩色分泌物可以用来制作出色的染发剂，所以他向{@creature darkling|vgm}放债人借钱，以便能够买到这种奇妙的生物。",
	"In medieval Europe and the Forgotten Realms alike, barbers do not merely cut hair. They also perform a variety of medical procedures, including dentistry, bloodletting (using leeches), and simple surgeries and battlefield amputations. In real-world Britain, barbers and surgeons were not recognized as separate professions until 1745. The barbershop in this adventure is a \"traditional\" barbershop where haircuts, hairstyling, and a variety of surgical and dental operations are all performed.": "在中世纪的欧洲和被遗忘的国度，理发师不仅仅是理发。他们还执行各种医疗程序，包括牙科、放血（使用水蛭），以及简单的手术和战场截肢。在现实世界的英国，直到1745年才承认理发师和外科医生是独立的职业。这个冒险中的理发店是一个 \"传统 \"的理发店，理发、发型以及各种外科和牙科手术都在这里进行。",
	"In addition to the top-down maps at the end of this document, this unique adventure comes with an equally unique walk through map, courtesy of author and illustrator Jason Bradley Thompson. Having created walk-through maps for classic D&D adventures both old and new, Jason has this time turned his attention to Vo/o's Guide to Monsters, highlighting a number of the new creatures from that book in this chillingly humorous tale of evil barbering. DMs can download the walk through map {@link here|http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/BarberSilverymoon.jpg}—but players who might take part in the adventure are warned that the map contains major spoilers.": "除了本文末尾的自上而下的地图外，这个独特的冒险还配有一张同样独特的穿行地图，由作者兼插图画家Jason Bradley Thompson提供。杰森曾为经典的新旧D&D冒险制作过穿行地图，这次他把注意力转向了《沃/奥的怪物指南》，在这个令人不寒而栗的幽默的邪恶理发故事中突出了该书中的一些新生物。管理员可以下载穿越地图（%0%）--但可能参加冒险的玩家要注意，地图中含有重大的破坏性内容。",
	"Unfortunately, the profits from selling those dyes proved not as high as Jooge had hoped. The darklings were soon pestering him to collect his debt. When they couldn't, the moneylenders sold that debt to a strange woman-actually a dreadful {@creature annis hag|vgm} named Errevastica in disguise. The possessor of a malevolent magic item called the evil comb, the hag had long had her eye on Bezoar, and saw Jooge as a way to take control of the korred. The hag had become the leader of a group of xvarts by disguising herself as a beautiful female specimen that came to be known as \"Xvartette.\" Visiting Jooge, the hag quickly took control of him and used him to capture the korred.": "不幸的是，事实证明，出售这些染料的利润并不像Jooge希望的那样高。黑人很快就缠着他讨债。当他们无法收回时，放债人将这笔债务卖给了一个奇怪的女人--实际上是一个乔装打扮的名叫Errevastica的可怕{@creature annis hag|vgm}。这个巫婆拥有一种叫做邪恶梳子的邪恶魔法物品，她长期以来一直盯着贝索尔，并将乔格视为控制科瑞德的一种方式。巫婆把自己伪装成一个美丽的女性标本，成为一群Xvarts的领导者，这个标本被称为 \"Xvartette\"。在拜访乔吉时，巫婆迅速控制了他，并利用他来抓捕科瑞德。",
	"By brushing Bezoar's hair with the evil comb, Errevastica turned the korred's luxurious locks into evil, living, tentacle-like hair that now does her bidding. Furthermore, the hag knew that this particular korred had a secret magic beyond the natural magic of its kind. Not only does its cut hair transform into the material of the tool or implement that cut it, that hair transforms into a living creature when cut or torn by another living creature's teeth, claws, or hands! Since capturing Bezoar and imprisoning the korred under the watchful gaze of the xvarts, the hag has allowed the xvarts to tear apart clumps of his hair. Those clumps are transformed into new xvarts, rapidly increasing their numbers as fast as the korred's hair can grow.": "通过用邪恶的梳子梳理贝索尔的头发，Errevastica将这只科瑞德的豪华头发变成了邪恶的、活生生的、像触角一样的头发，现在为她效劳。此外，巫婆知道这个特殊的科瑞德有一种秘密的魔法，超越了它的同类的自然魔法。它不仅能将剪断的头发转化为剪断它的工具或器具的材料，当被另一个生物的牙齿、爪子或手剪断或撕裂时，那根头发也会转化为一个活生生的生物！\"。自从抓住贝索尔并将科瑞德囚禁在Xvarts的注视下，这个巫婆就允许Xvarts撕开他的头发块。这些块状物被转化为新的Xvarts，它们的数量迅速增加，就像Korred的头发可以生长的那样快。",
	"In a masterstroke of malevolence, the hag then forced Jooge to pull out two clumps of the korred's hair-one touched by the evil comb and one untouched. Those two clumps transformed into two new versions of Jooge: an evil version who is the hag's staunch ally, and a good version who was brainwashed to remove all memory of the hag.": "在一个恶毒的大手笔中，巫婆然后强迫Jooge拔出两团Korred的头发--一团被邪恶的梳子碰过，一团没有被碰过。这两团头发变成了两个新的乔格：一个是邪恶的版本，是女巫的坚定盟友，另一个是被洗脑的好版本，删除了所有关于女巫的记忆。",
	"Now, while the original Jooge rots in the hag's dungeons below the barbershop, good Jooge runs the shop by day, using it as a cover for the hag's nefarious activities. Evil Jooge runs the shop by night, using it to capture unsuspecting prey. Some of the shop's victims are eaten by the hag or sacrificed by the xvarts in their dungeon below the shop. Others are used by evil  Jooge in his diabolical barbering experiments, and then destroyed or brainwashed and set free.": "现在，当原来的Jooge在理发店下面的巫婆地牢里腐烂时，好的Jooge白天经营这家店，利用它作为巫婆邪恶活动的掩护。邪恶的Jooge在晚上经营这家店，利用它来捕捉毫无戒心的猎物。店里的一些受害者被巫婆吃掉，或者被商店下面的地牢里的Xvarts牺牲掉。其他人则被邪恶的Jooge用于他邪恶的理发实验，然后被摧毁或被洗脑后释放。",
	"Saddened by the mysterious changes in her father, yet thankfully unaware of all the evil goings-on below the shop, Jooge's daughter, Mops, spends most of the day alone in her room or playing in the garden. Her only friend is a {@creature boggle|vgm}, which is devoted to the young girl but lives in fear of Errevastica.": "Jooge的女儿Mops对她父亲的神秘变化感到悲伤，但幸好她不知道商店下面发生的所有邪恶事件，她每天大部分时间都独自呆在房间里或在花园里玩。她唯一的朋友是一只{@creature boggle|vgm}，它对这个小姑娘很忠诚，但却生活在对Errevastica的恐惧中。",
	"Now, only the adventurers can stop the evil barber and the annis hag before all of Silverymoon is overrun by xvarts and tormented by evil Jooge's hair-cutting schemes.": "现在，只有冒险家们能在整个银月城被Xvarts占领和被邪恶的Jooge的剪发计划折磨之前阻止邪恶的理发师和Annis hag。",
	"The {@i Barber of Silverymoon} begins with the characters arriving in the city and hearing rumors of the mysterious disappearances. The first time the characters hear how the returned victims all come back with their hair cropped, colored, and styled in the most exquisite ways, have one of the characters remember spotting Jooge's barbershop as the party entered the city. The rumors the characters hear and their subsequent inquiries eventually lead them toward the shop.": "{@i Barber of Silverymoon}从人物到达城市并听到神秘失踪的传闻开始。角色们第一次听到回来的受害者都是以最精致的方式剪发、染发、做造型的，让其中一个角色记得在队伍进入城市时发现了Jooge的理发店。角色们听到的传言和他们随后的询问最终将他们引向了这家店。",
	"(Though it has its darker moments, this is a whimsical adventure, so don't worry too much about matters such as why no one else in Silverymoon has discovered the connection between Jooge's barbershop and the disappearances.)": "(虽然它有黑暗的时刻，但这是一次异想天开的冒险，所以不要太担心诸如为什么银月镇的其他人没有发现乔格的理发店和失踪事件之间的联系等问题）。",
	"If any characters have the guild artisan or entertainer background, or if the players use roleplaying to have their characters engage any city NPCs of your choice in conversation, they learn that the barber-surgeon Jooge Nopsmoth is well regarded both as a good father and an expert barber. He is, however, known to be bad with money, always buying expensive new haircutting equipment and pricey gifts for his daughter, Mops.": "如果任何角色有公会工匠或艺人的背景，或者如果玩家使用角色扮演，让他们的角色与你选择的任何城市NPC进行对话，他们会了解到理发师-外科医生Jooge Nopsmoth作为一个好父亲和理发专家而受到好评。然而，众所周知，他不善于用钱，总是为他的女儿Mops购买昂贵的新理发设备和昂贵的礼物。",
	"More than once, Jooge has taken out small loans from his neighbors, though these are always repaid. His neighbors also know that Jooge has recently taken to carving and selling abstract metal sculptures shaped like locks of hair. (In truth, these are locks of korred hair, which turns to steel when Jooge cuts it with his scissors.)": "不止一次，Jooge从他的邻居那里借了小额贷款，尽管这些贷款总是被偿还的。他的邻居们还知道，Jooge最近开始雕刻和销售抽象的金属雕塑，形状像一绺一绺的头发（事实上，这些是一绺一绺的红色头发，当Jooge用剪刀剪开时，这些头发会变成钢铁）。",
	"Jooge's neighbors can also tell the characters that the barber purchased a flail snail from travelling wizards some six months ago, hoping to use it to create unique hair dyes and pigments. Flail snails are rare and valuable, and the people of Silverymoon were impressed. For a brief time after that, a number of mysterious, short, cl oaked figures were seen around the barbershop. Though many of his friends feared that these strangers might be planning a robbery, Jooge seemed unconcerned. In any case, the cloaked figures have not been seen in months.": "Jooge的邻居还可以告诉人物，理发师在大约六个月前从旅行巫师那里购买了一只扇形蜗牛，希望用它来制造独特的染发剂和颜料。扇形蜗牛很罕见，也很有价值，银月城的人们对此印象深刻。在那之后的短暂时间里，理发店周围出现了一些神秘的、矮小的、claked的身影。虽然他的许多朋友担心这些陌生人可能在策划抢劫，但乔格似乎并不担心。无论如何，这些隐身人影已经几个月没有出现了。",
	"If the adventurers ask specific questions about Jooge's work, one of his neighbors mentions how Jooge had one of his own teeth replaced with an iron tooth sometime within the last six months. Why Jooge didn't use a gold or porcelain replacement tooth, the neighbor doesn't know.": "如果冒险家们问起有关乔格工作的具体问题，他的一个邻居就会提到乔格是如何在过去六个月内的某个时候把自己的一颗牙齿换成铁牙的。为什么Jooge没有用金牙或瓷牙替换，这位邻居不知道。",
	"If any of the characters have the charlatan, criminal, or urchin backgrounds, or if the players use roleplaying to have their characters make further inquiries about Jooge's business, they learn that Jooge took out a loan of 10,000 gp from some criminals to buy the flail snail. Further research turns up that Jooge borrowed the money from {@creature darkling|vgm} moneylenders-the cloaked figures seen by his friends and neighbors.": "如果任何一个角色有江湖郎中、罪犯或顽童的背景，或者如果玩家使用角色扮演让他们的角色对Jooge的生意做进一步的调查，他们会了解到Jooge从一些罪犯那里借了10,000gp来购买耀眼的蜗牛。进一步的调查发现，Jooge是从{@creature darkling|vgm}放债人那里借的钱--他的朋友和邻居们看到的隐身人。",
	"With a few clandestine inquiries, the adventurers can set up a meeting with the darklings, who tell the characters that after several unsuccessful attempts to get their money back from Jooge, they sold his debt to a mysterious rich human woman. The woman never gave her name; the darklings know only that she was beautiful (by human standards) except for the false teeth she wore, all of which were crafted of iron. (This woman was the annis hag Errevastica under the effect of its {@spell disguise self} spell.)": "通过一些秘密的询问，冒险者们可以安排与黑衣人会面，他们告诉角色们，在几次试图从Jooge那里拿回他们的钱而未果后，他们把他的债务卖给了一个神秘的人类富婆。这个女人从来没有说过她的名字；黑衣人只知道她很美（以人类的标准），除了她戴的假牙，所有的假牙都是用铁做的。 这个女人是受其（%0%）咒语影响的女巫Errevastica）。",
	"If you feel as though the characters might need combat assistance in the adventure, one or two darklings can be hired as mercenaries at a rate of 100 gp each per day.": "如果你觉得角色在冒险中可能需要战斗协助，可以雇佣一到两个黑衣人作为雇佣兵，每人每天100戈比。",
	"From the outside, Jooge's shop and house make up a modest, well-kept building whose only remarkable feature is the flail snail he keeps in his garden. But in the subterranean levels beneath the barbershop, Errevastica the annis hag has created a place of horror.": "从外面看，Jooge的商店和房子构成了一栋普通的、保存完好的建筑，唯一引人注目的是他在花园里养的那只叭叽螺。但在理发店下面的地下一层，年老的巫婆Errevastica创造了一个恐怖的地方。",
	"The interior walls of this old stone well are damp and slippery. The water's surface is 20 feet below the ground. Climbing down to the water ({@area 2A|2A. Bottom of Well}) or back up again without the aid of a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.": "这口老石井的内壁潮湿而湿滑。水面低于地面20英尺。在没有绳子的帮助下，爬到水面上（（%0%））或者再爬上来，需要成功地进行DC15力量（竞技）检查。",
	"This small backyard garden contains geraniums in bloom, assorted plants and herbs, and Jooge's {@creature flail snail|vgm}. The snail is mostly tame, but it shies away from humanoids it doesn't know. It attacks if touched or cornered. Jooge and Mops are the only ones who know the soothing song that calms the snail down enough for its colorful secretions to be harvested.": "这个后院小花园里有盛开的天竺葵、各种植物和草药，还有乔格的（%0%）。蜗牛大部分是温顺的，但它对不认识的人类避之唯恐不及。如果被碰触或被逼到角落，它就会攻击。只有Jooge和Mops知道那首让蜗牛安静下来的舒缓歌曲，以便收获它的彩色分泌物。",
	"A statue of a gnome stands out front, holding a sign saying \"Open\" or \"Closed.\" A string of teeth hangs in the front window, advertising that as a barber surgeon, Jooge performs dentistry.": "一个地精的雕像站在门外，举着一个 \"开放 \"或 \"关闭 \"的牌子。前面的窗户上挂着一串牙齿，宣传作为一名理发师，乔格会进行牙科治疗。",
	"The talented but humble barber Jooge Nopsmoth works here. His prices are as follows:": "有才华但谦逊的理发师Jooge Nopsmoth在这里工作。他的价格如下。",
	"Shave: 5 cp": "刮痧。5cp",
	"Simple haircut: 2 sp": "简单理发：2元",
	"Fancy haircut: 3-5 sp": "花式理发。3-5秒",
	"Coloring: 5 sp (in addition to haircut cost)": "着色。5元（除理发费用外）。",
	"Extract tooth: 2 sp": "拔牙：2分",
	"Root canal: 1 gp": "根管治疗：1克普",
	"Leeching (blood extraction): 1 gp": "沥血（抽血）。1 gp",
	"Battlefield surgery: 5gp (restores ld8 hitpoints; can be performed only once per day per customer)": "战场手术。5GP（恢复ld8的命中率；每位顾客每天只能进行一次）。",
	"By day, the \"good\" false Jooge works here (neutral good {@creature commoner} with Wisdom 6 and Charisma 15; see the {@i Monster Manual}). Good Jooge is friendly, but he knows nothing about any evil goings-on in the city. Magic such as {@spell detect thoughts} reveals that he is telling the truth, and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check notes that he seems somewhat distracted and absent-minded. However, a {@spell detect magic} spell cast on this false Jooge notes a faint aura of transmutation magic around him. This aura cannot be dispelled or broken except by a {@spell wish} spell, which turns Jooge back into a pile of hair.": "白天，\"好 \"的假Jooge在这里工作（中性好（%0%），智慧6，魅力15；见（%1%））。善良的Jooge很友好，但他对城市里的任何邪恶行为一无所知。诸如{@spell detect thoughts}的魔法显示他说的是真话，而成功的DC10智慧（洞察力）检查指出他似乎有点心不在焉，心不在焉。然而，对这个假Jooge施展的{@spell detect magic}法术注意到他周围有一个微弱的转化魔法的光环。这个光环无法被驱散或打破，除非用一个{@spell wish}的咒语，把Jooge变回一堆头发。",
	"The shop contains a sink, mirrors, a fireplace, and normal barbering and surgery equipment. A secret trapdoor sits under the barber chair, and can be noticed by a character searching the room with a successful DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor is barred from below during the day, requiring a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) check to break open.": "店里有一个水槽、镜子、一个壁炉和普通的理发和手术设备。在理发椅下面有一个秘密的活板门，在房间里搜索的人物可以通过成功的DC21智慧（感知）检查注意到。活板门在白天的时候被挡在下面，需要成功通过DC23力量（运动）检查才能打开。",
	"{@i {@b Nothing but the Tooth}}. Good Jooge's one unusual physical trait is a magic iron tooth replacing his right top bicuspid. The tooth radiates evil under a {@spell detect evil and good} spell. If he is asked about the tooth, Jooge doesn't remember where he got it, but assumes that he must have done dentistry on himself and forgotten about it. The iron tooth allows the annis hag in {@area 4J|4J. Xvarts' Lair} to hear through good Jooge's ears. If the hag hears adventurers snooping around, it summons a {@create banderhobb|vgm} and orders the creature to deal with them that night. If any of the characters have Jooge cut their hair, the banderhobb uses that hair as a focus to find the characters and surprise them. If not, the characters might get some warning of the creature as it tracks them, at your discretion.": "{@i {@b Nothing but the Tooth}}. 好乔吉的一个不寻常的身体特征是有一颗神奇的铁牙取代了他的右上二尖牙。这颗牙齿在{@spell detect evil and good}的咒语下散发着邪恶的气息。如果有人问起这颗牙齿，乔吉不记得他是从哪里得到的，但他认为自己一定是给自己做了牙科手术而忘记了这一点。这颗铁牙可以让{@area 4J|4J. Xvarts' Lair}的安尼斯女巫通过好乔格的耳朵听到声音。如果女巫听到冒险者在附近窥探，它就会召唤出一个（%3%），并命令该生物在当晚对付他们。如果有哪个角色让Jooge剪了头发，班德霍布就会用那根头发作为焦点来寻找角色并给他们一个惊喜。如果没有，在怪物追踪他们时，人物可能会得到一些警告，由你决定。",
	"At dusk, good Jooge closes his shop, makes dinner for Mops, and goes to bed. Three hours after dusk, evil Jooge (a neutral evil {@creature warlock of the archfey|vgm}) ascends from {@area 3|3. Barbershop of Evil} in the cellars, reopens the shop, and runs it until dawn, accompanied by four {@creature xvart|vgm|xvarts} from {@area 4J|4J. Xvarts' Lair}. The xvarts hide in {@area 1E|1E. Storeroom}, emerging only if evil Jooge is under attack or if he calls for them.": "黄昏时分，善良的Jooge关闭了他的商店，为Mops做了晚餐，然后去睡觉。黄昏后三小时，邪恶的乔吉（一个中立的邪恶（%0%））从地窖的（%1%）中升起，重新开店，并经营到黎明，与他一起的还有来自（%3%）的四个（%2%）。xvarts躲在{@area 1E|1E. Storeroom}里，只有在邪恶的Jooge受到攻击或他呼唤他们时才会出现。",
	"Evil Jooge has adapted the barber chair so that pushing a secret button on its back causes the armrests of the chair to turn into manacles. Anyone sitting in the chair is restrained and cannot use his or her hands. The trapdoor then drops open and the chair automatically slides down a specially constructed groove to {@area 2C|2C. Stair} below, with evil Jooge following close behind, then barring the door shut again.": "邪恶的Jooge对理发椅进行了改造，使之按下椅背上的一个秘密按钮，使椅子的扶手变成手铐。任何坐在椅子上的人都被限制住了，不能使用他或她的手。然后，活板门被打开，椅子自动从一个特别建造的凹槽中滑落到下面的{@area 2C|2C. Stair}，邪恶的Jooge紧随其后，然后把门重新闩上。",
	"If the adventurers come by while evil Jooge is running the shop, he tries to get the most formidable combatant to sit in the chair, then activates the manacles and drops that character underground. A character restrained in the chair must succeed on a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check to break free. Jooge then calls in his xvart guards to deal with the other characters before heading downstairs.": "如果冒险者在邪恶的Jooge开店的时候过来，他就会试图让最强大的战斗人员坐在椅子上，然后启动手铐，把这个角色扔到地下。被束缚在椅子上的人物必须通过DC22力量（运动）检查才能挣脱。然后，乔吉叫来他的xvart卫兵，在下楼前处理其他角色。",
	"This cluttered backroom contains wine (used as antiseptic), mandrake root and laudanum (both used as anesthetic), hair oils, pomades, scissors, clamps, drills, and other mundane equipment. A hole in the floor leads down to a disused well turned into a leech pit ({@area 2B|2B. Leech Pit}), from which Jooge collects the leeches he uses for bloodletting. A Small or smaller creature can climb down the hole. While evil Jooge works at night, his four {@creature xvart} guards are found here, snacking on leeches.": "这个杂乱的密室里有酒（用作防腐剂）、曼德拉根和鸦片酊（都用作麻醉剂）、发油、润肤油、剪刀、夹子、钻头和其他世俗设备。地板上的一个洞通向一口废弃的井，变成了一个水蛭坑（{@area 2B|2B. Leech Pit}），乔吉从那里收集他用来放血的水蛭。一个小的或更小的生物可以爬下这个洞。当邪恶的乔吉在晚上工作时，他的四个{@creature xvart}守卫会在这里发现，他们在吃水蛭。",
	"This area holds pots, pans, and dry foodstuffs, as well as a second fireplace with a small stove.": "这个区域放着锅碗瓢盆和干粮，以及第二个带小炉子的壁炉。",
	"The house's front bedroom contains Jooge's clothes and his life savings of 13 gp and 35 sp. A small portrait from happier times depicts Jooge, Mops, and Giselle, who died a few years ago.": "房子前面的卧室里有乔格的衣服和他一生的积蓄13个金币和35个西班牙镑。一幅快乐时期的小画像描绘了乔格、拖把和几年前去世的吉赛尔。",
	"Jooge's eight-year-old daughter Mops has a beautifully furnished room full of toys, but she has been sad the last few months because she senses something different about her father. A friendly and nonthreatening adventurer can win Mops's confidence.": "Jooge八岁的女儿Mops有一个装潢精美的房间，里面摆满了玩具，但她在过去几个月里一直很伤心，因为她感觉到父亲有些不同。一个友好而不具威胁性的冒险家可以赢得Mops的信任。",
	"If the characters are successful in talking to Mops, she confides that her father sometimes has an iron tooth, and sometimes doesn't. When he has the tooth, her father is absentminded and forgetful. When he doesn't have it, he becomes cruel and temperamental. Also, Mops sometimes hears people downstairs late at night talking in a strange language (these are the xvarts speaking Abyssal).": "如果人物成功地与拖把交谈，她会告诉大家，她父亲有时有一颗铁牙，有时没有。当他有这颗牙的时候，她父亲就会心不在焉，忘乎所以。当他没有铁牙的时候，他就会变得很残忍，脾气很坏。此外，Mops有时会在深夜听到楼下有人用一种奇怪的语言交谈（这些人是讲深渊的Xvarts）。",
	"Mops is frequently visited by her new imaginary friend Wallace-a {@creature boggle|vgm} summoned from the Feywild by her loneliness. Errevastica sensed Wallace's presence in the house and quickly cowed him into compliance, and is using him now to distract Mops from her father's state. Wallace will not directly betray Errevastica, but he fears that one day the annis hag might eat his new friend. If anyone threatens Mops, the boggle uses his powers to help Mops escape, even if he dies in the process.": "莫普斯经常被她的新假想朋友华莱士拜访--一个被她的孤独感从精灵世界召唤出来的（%0%）。Errevastica感觉到了华莱士在房子里的存在，并很快让他屈服，现在正利用他来转移Mops对她父亲状态的注意力。华莱士不会直接背叛Errevastica，但他担心有一天这个女巫会吃掉他的新朋友。如果有人威胁到Mops，博格就会用他的力量帮助Mops逃跑，即使他在这个过程中死亡。",
	"The well shaft is 40 feet deep in total, with the bottom 20 feet filled with water that flows in from the River Raurin. A Small or smaller creature can squeeze down the narrow water-filled side channel leading to {@area 2B|2B. Leech Pit}. Removing the grill that blocks the side channel, or opening the hatch leading to {@area 3A|3A.

	"At the bottom of the well, the water is filled with long strands of thick, black hair, all leading down to a clogged circular drain. The hair is living korred hair.

A hair clone is identical to the original creature in every way, except that it takes on an evil alignment while maintaining the original creature's alignment component on the lawful-chaotic axis. Additionally, only creatures that are challenge rating 1/4 or less and have no class levels can be cloned.

Whether or not the creature is blinded, its hair becomes a gateway to another plane of existence (the DM determines which plane).
