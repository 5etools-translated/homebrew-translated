In that case, you'll want some basic, atmospheric information on the city.": "亡灵之约》的大部分行动都发生在瓦林根坟场下。然而，当角色第一次到达时，或者在冒险过程中向圣人咨询时，他们可能会在城市里呆上一小段时间。在这种情况下，你会需要一些关于这个城市的基本的、大气的信息。",
	"Phlan has a thousand-year history of ascendance and collapse. Currently, it's experiencing tough times. Less than a year ago, the city's Lord Protector Anivar Daoran was killed in an apparent construction accident while inspecting renovations at Valjevo Castle. Daoran wasn't much of a Lord Protector and he isn't widely mourned. Because he left no heir, the Knight Commander of the Black Fist, Ector Brahms, was declared the Lord Regent. Brahms is an honorable but hidebound man, and Phlan has declined tragically under his guidance. Soldiers of the Black Fist rule the city by martial law. They swiftly dispense punishment but seldom justice. Their increasingly harsh methods are failing to preserve law or order.": "Phlan有千年的上升和崩溃的历史。目前，它正经历着艰难的时期。不到一年前，该城市的保护神阿尼瓦尔-道朗（Anivar Daoran）在视察瓦尔耶沃城堡的翻新工程时死于一场明显的建筑事故。道朗并不是一个好的保护者，他并没有被广泛地哀悼。因为他没有留下继承人，黑拳骑士长埃克托-勃拉姆斯被宣布为摄政王。勃拉姆斯是一个可敬的人，但也是一个藏污纳垢的人，在他的指导下，弗兰已经悲惨地衰落了。黑拳组织的士兵们通过戒严法来统治这座城市。他们迅速地实施惩罚，但很少有正义感。他们越来越严厉的方法无法维护法律和秩序。",
	"Without the Black Fist to protect them, the people have turned to two other sources; the city's guilds (chiefly stonewrights, carpenters, ironhands, and merchants) and a criminal organization called the Welcomers. These six organizations are constantly at odds with one another over power in the city and, aside from limited exceptions among the guilds, are completely unable to cooperate for the betterment of Phlan. Lord Protector Daoran had begun many construction projects around the city, renovating ancient buildings and reconstructing those damaged in recent wars. All of that work is halted since the city has no money to pay the guilds for their labor; half-built structures are everywhere and heaps of unused construction material clog the streets.": "没有了黑拳的保护，人们转向了另外两个来源：城市的行会（主要是石匠、木匠、铁匠和商人）和一个叫做 \"欢迎者 \"的犯罪组织。这六个组织为了争夺城市的权力而不断发生冲突，除了行会中有限的例外，他们完全无法为改善普兰的状况而合作。护国公Daoran已经在城市周围开始了许多建设项目，翻新古老的建筑，重建那些在最近的战争中被破坏的建筑。所有这些工作都被停止了，因为城市没有钱来支付行会的劳动；半成品的建筑到处都是，一堆堆未使用的建筑材料堵塞了街道。",
	"Trade, too, has come to a standstill, leaving merchants with few legal ways to make a living. The Welcomers are openly criminal, and the once-honest guilds are only a few steps removed from being organized crime syndicates themselves.  The Black Fist's methods have made it the people's enemy instead of their guardian, so most honest folk have retreated into the ranks of the Welcomers and the guilds for survival.": "贸易也陷入了停滞状态，商人们几乎没有合法的谋生手段。欢迎者是公开的罪犯，而曾经诚实的行会离有组织的犯罪集团本身只有几步之遥。 黑拳的方法使它成为人们的敌人，而不是他们的守护者，所以大多数诚实的人为了生存而退回到欢迎者和公会的队伍中。",
	"The graveyard is the only notable feature of Phlan that sits north of the river. Most of the city is on what's presumed to be an artificial island; sometime in the dim past, Phlan's original builders dug a canal to split the Stojanow River into two channels at its mouth, with the two branches flowing around the city like a moat. A bridge near the city's North Gate crosses the river a short distance west of the graveyard, so mourners can walk to the cemetery easily.": "墓地是弗兰河以北唯一值得注意的特征。这座城市的大部分都在一个假定的人工岛上；在过去的某个时候，弗兰的最初建造者挖了一条运河，将斯托亚诺河在河口分成两条河道，两条支流像护城河一样流向城市周围。城市北门附近的一座桥在墓地西边不远处横跨河流，所以送葬者可以轻松地走到墓地。",
	"The cemetery itself is quite beautiful.": "墓地本身是相当美丽的。",
	"Valhingen Graveyard looks more like a park than a cemetery and stands in stark contrast to the ramshackle, half-built Phlan. Gravel walkways wend between tall trees, well-tended beds of shrubs and flowers, sturdy mausoleums, and rows of headstones, monuments, and commemorative statues.": "瓦林根墓地看起来更像一个公园，而不是一个墓地，与破旧的、半建成的普兰形成鲜明的对比。碎石人行道在高大的树木、精心照料的灌木和花坛、坚固的陵墓以及一排排的墓碑、纪念碑和纪念性雕像之间蜿蜒。",
	"You need only a few moments to spot a man and a woman dressed in simple, home-spun gray robes trimming shrubs and pulling weeds from between gravestones.": "你只需花点时间就能发现一男一女穿着简单的家纺灰色长袍修剪灌木，并从墓碑间拔出杂草。",
	"The man and woman are clerics of Kelemvor named {@b Drolo} and {@b Fedya}. They are happy to talk about their work in the cemetery, but they grow morose if asked about undead. Instead, they direct characters to a small chapel where Doomguide Yovir Glandon can be found.": "这一男一女是凯勒莫的神职人员，名叫（%0%）和（%1%）。他们很乐意谈论他们在墓地的工作，但如果被问及亡灵，他们会变得很沮丧。相反，他们把人物引向一个小教堂，在那里可以找到厄运之神尤维尔-格兰顿。",
	"Doomguide is the title adopted by heads of clerical chapters among the faithful of Kelemvor, Faeriin's deity of death and the dead. \"Doom\" refers not to a bleak destiny but simply to the fact that all mortals face an end to life. Kelemvor's servants ensure that the dead are properly interred and respected, and they see to the needs of the bereaved. To most of Kelemvor's.  faithful, raising a dead person as an undead creature is the most horrific sacrilege imaginable and an unforgivable violation of human sanctity.": "末日向导是凯勒莫（Kelemvor）信徒中的教士分会负责人采用的头衔，凯勒莫是法里安的死亡和亡灵之神。\"厄运 \"不是指黯淡的命运，而只是指所有凡人都面临着生命的终结。Kelemvor的仆人确保死者得到适当的安葬和尊重，并满足丧亲者的需求。对大多数Kelemvor的信徒来说，把死人变成不死生物是可以想象的最可怕的亵渎行为，是对人类神圣性的不可原谅的侵犯。",

	"Yovir prefers to let characters bring up the subject of the handbill or rumors of undead themselves, rather than asking them if they're mercenaries looking for work (that fact should be obvious to anyone who glances at the heavily armed and armored characters). Once asked, he relates the following tale. During the course of their conversation, Yovir provides the following information:": "尤维尔更喜欢让人物自己提出传单或亡灵传闻的话题，而不是问他们是否是找工作的雇佣兵（这个事实对任何瞥一眼全副武装和装甲的人物来说都应该很明显）。一旦被问到，他就讲述了下面的故事。在他们谈话的过程中，尤维尔提供了以下信息。",

	"If the adventurers accept Yovir's offer of a guide, Yovir calls out \"Cassyt!\", and a young woman named {@creature acolyte|mm|Cassyt} shuffles into the room. She is a plain-looking female half-elf who appears to be in her early twenties. She uses the acolyte stat block. Besides acting as guide, Cassyt also carries a lantern to help light the tunnels, unless characters prefer darkness.

	"Cassyt is a young Kelemvorite who has spent more time in her books than in the catacombs of the graveyard. Despite this, she has an unusually sunny disposition and is prone to chatter incessantly rattling off minutiae and trivia about the catacombs.

She also has a dry, albeit slightly warped, sense of humor.": "卡西特是一个年轻的凯勒莫里特人，她在书中度过的时间比在墓地的地下墓穴中度过的时间还要长。尽管如此，她的性格却异常阳光，容易喋喋不休地讲述墓穴中的细枝末节和琐事。 她对地下墓穴的第1至第3区（历史+4；仅地下墓穴）和急救（医学+3）有相当的了解。她也有一种干巴巴的幽默感，尽管有点扭曲。",

	"The entrance to the catacombs is through a stone structure that resembles the many mausoleums in the graveyard, except this building has no door, just an open archway. Inside is a small paved floor that opens into a wide stone staircase. The building is little more than a covering over the stairs. Dwarves can easily see that the stone building is much newer than the steps; the walls and roof have stood for no more than two centuries, but the steps are at least four times that old; possibly even older.": "通往地下墓穴的入口是通过一个石头结构，与墓地里的许多陵墓相似，只是这个建筑没有门，只有一个开放的拱门。里面是一个小的铺面，通向一个宽大的石阶。这座建筑只不过是楼梯上的一个覆盖物而已。矮人可以很容易地看到，这座石制建筑比台阶要新得多；墙壁和屋顶已经存在了不超过两个世纪，但台阶至少有四倍的历史；甚至可能更久。",

Unless otherwise specified, the ceilings of the catacombs are only 10 feet high.": "{@b Ceilings and Walls.}虽然地下墓穴都是由土和坚硬的石头挖掘而成，但这些隧道看起来一点也不像矿井。大多数墙壁和天花板都是用光滑的石头面对的，或者有一些装饰性的特征，如假柱子、窗台、几何图案和生活场景或宗教主题雕刻在石头上。 除非另有说明，地下墓穴的天花板只有10英尺高。",
	"{@b Crypts.} Most individual crypts are not described, because they're all basically the same. The walls are carved with loculi (niches) that contain either a single body or the stacked bones of many bodies. Most of these crypts aren't very interesting; they contain no treasure, no monsters, and no clues. Most of the bodies in a particular crypt are related somehow. Usually they're of the same family, but customs changed over the centuries: some crypts contain members of the same guild, or people of the same age, or people who died of the same causes or who served in the same military units. Characters should be less interested in what's inside individual crypts than by what's happening in the tunnels around them.": "{@b Crypts.} 大多数单独的墓穴都没有描述，因为它们基本上都是一样的。墙壁上雕刻着Loculi（壁龛），里面要么是一具尸体，要么是许多尸体的叠加骨骼。这些墓穴中的大多数都不是很有趣；它们没有宝藏，没有怪物，也没有线索。某一墓穴中的大多数尸体都有某种关联。通常他们是同一家族的人，但几个世纪以来，习俗发生了变化：一些墓穴里有同一公会的成员，或同一年龄的人，或死于同一原因的人，或在同一军事单位服务的人。角色们应该对单个墓穴内的情况不感兴趣，而对墓穴周围的隧道中发生的事情感兴趣。",
	"{@b Light.} The catacombs are completely dark except where noted. Niches are carved into the walls every 20 feet for placement of oil lamps, but lamps aren't left in the niches. The faithful of Kelemvor bring lamps with them when they come into the catacombs. In a few places, open shafts have been dug from the catacombs to the surface to let in air and light. These are noted in text and on the map.": "{@b Light.} 地下墓穴是完全黑暗的，除非有说明。墙壁上每隔20英尺就有一个壁龛，用于放置油灯，但灯并不放在壁龛里。凯勒莫的信徒们进入地下墓穴时都会带着灯。在一些地方，从地下墓穴到地面挖出了露天的竖井，以便让空气和光线进入。这些都在文本和地图上注明。",
	"{@b Sound.} The catacombs deaden sound effectively. For lack of a better phrase, the catacombs are, for the most part, as silent as the grave. Occasionally, dripping water can be heard. Open shafts for letting in air and light sometimes produce unsettling akin moaning or whistling on windy days. It is not unheard of to hear distant crying while in the catacombs, but it is attributed to those on in the graveyard, above, mourning their dead instead of any malevolence within the catacombs.": "{@b Sound.} 地下墓穴能有效地消除声音。由于缺乏更好的措辞，地下墓穴在大多数情况下都像坟墓一样寂静。偶尔，可以听到滴水声。在大风天里，用于通风和采光的开放式竖井有时会产生令人不安的类似呻吟或口哨的声音。在地下墓穴中听到远处的哭声也不是没有，但这是由于上面的墓地中的人在哀悼他们的死者，而不是地下墓穴中的任何恶意。",
	"{@b Undead.} The faithful of Kelemvor cleared all the undead out of these catacombs decades ago and kept the tunnels clear since then. However, due to the sheer size of the catacombs, the Red Wizard Rorreth Monforoth has had plenty of time to animate undead creatures from the crypts before their presence was prematurely discovered. Monforoth can't control all the undead he created, and some of them strayed into areas of the catacombs that allowed their discovery.": "{@b Undead.} 几十年前，凯勒莫的信徒们将所有的亡灵从这些地下墓穴中清理出来，并从那时起保持着隧道的畅通。然而，由于地下墓穴的巨大规模，红袍巫师罗瑞思-蒙福罗斯（Rorreth Monforoth）在他们的存在被过早发现之前，已经有足够的时间将地下墓穴中的不死生物活化。蒙福斯无法控制他创造的所有亡灵，其中一些亡灵误入了地下墓穴的区域，使他们被发现。",
	"{@b Water.} Most of the tunnels and crypts stay dry. There are puddles or even knee-deep water in some sections that stray beneath the Stojanow River.": "{@b Water.} 大部分的隧道和地下通道都保持干燥。在一些游离于斯托亚诺河下的路段，有水坑，甚至是齐膝深的水。",
	"{@b Gates.} The gates are of sturdy and relatively new construction.

Doing so makes an obscene amount of noise, however.": "{@b Gates.} 大门是坚固的，相对较新的建筑。除非另有说明，大门是锁着的，需要一套盗贼的工具和成功的DC15灵巧检查才能打开。如果成功地进行DC15力量检查，大门可以被强行打开。然而，这样做会产生令人厌恶的噪音。",

	"A sneaky adventurer can attack him while he is still asleep, provided that they are not seen by the zombies.  Because he is unconscious, he loses his Dexterity modifier to AC and attacks are made against him with advantage, but the barrels grants him three-quarters cover, which raises his AC to 15. The first missed attack wakes the kobold who immediately starts shouting, initiating combat.": "偷偷摸摸的冒险者可以在他还在睡觉的时候攻击他，只要他们不被僵尸看到。 因为他是昏迷的，所以他失去了他的灵巧修改器，对他的攻击是有优势的，但是木桶给予他四分之三的掩护，这使他的AC提高到了15。第一次失误的攻击唤醒了哥布林，他立即开始喊叫，开始了战斗。",

	"If characters are triumphant and explore the inner chambers of area 14a, they find a modest-sized room, appointed in the furnishings of living quarters--a few straw pallets, a couple chests (full of mundane personal belongings), and a table with a few chairs--all in complete disarray. Furniture has been turned over and upset, papers are strewn all about the room. Among them, only a set of maps of the catacombs are of any interest. The maps are labeled in Draconic. If the adventurers are unable to translate them, Doomguide Glandon offers to do so, even going so far as to say that they are the most accurate set of maps of the catacombs that he has ever seen and asks to keep them.": "如果角色们胜利地探索了14a区的内室，他们会发现一个大小适中的房间，里面摆放着生活区的家具--几张草垛，几个箱子（装满了普通的个人物品），以及一张有几把椅子的桌子--所有这些都完全混乱了。家具被翻得乱七八糟，文件散落在房间的各个角落。在这些文件中，只有一套地下墓穴的地图是有意义的。这些地图是用德拉贡语标注的。如果冒险者无法翻译它们，\"厄运向导 \"格兰登会提供翻译服务，甚至说这是他见过的最准确的一套地下墓穴地图，并要求保留它们。",

	"If the cultist is captured alive, he does not willingly divulge any of their secrets. Any punishment that the Cult might mete out for his betrayal would be far worse than anything the adventurers are likely willing to do.  Any question to that effect is met with an insult, a mouthful of spittle, or--more likely--both. If compelled to speak, by use of charm person or similar ability, he knows only that he was sent to Valhingen to assist Rorreth in creating an army of undead. Once done, they were to use the undead to dig towards Phlan and begin the search for the Pool of Radiance.": "如果这个邪教分子被活捉，他并不愿意泄露他们的任何秘密。邪教对他的背叛可能给予的任何惩罚都会比冒险者可能愿意做的任何事情都要糟糕。 任何与此相关的问题都会遭到侮辱、一口唾沫，或者--更有可能--两者都是。如果被强迫说话，通过使用魅惑者或类似的能力，他只知道他被派往Valhingen，协助Rorreth建立一支亡灵军队。一旦完成，他们将利用这些亡灵向弗兰挖掘，开始寻找光芒之池。",
	"While the adventurers were occupied in Area 14b, Monforoth was busy packing his haversack with any items that he felt might implicate the Red Wizards of Thay. If he escapes, he takes his haversack with him.

	"Additionally, there are a set of documents from Rath Modar that charge Rorreth with creating a host of undead in the catacombs beneath Valhingen Cemetery and to use them to dig their way south and east beneath Phlan in an attempt to locate the Pool of Radiance.
