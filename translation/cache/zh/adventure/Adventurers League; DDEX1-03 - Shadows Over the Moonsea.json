They also cross paths with some of the local wildlife.": "在第二部分中，队伍前往村庄，沿途有机会从路过的商人吉尔弗隆-米隆和他的儿子吉尔蒙那里收集更多信息。他们还与当地的一些野生动物发生了交集。",
	"In Part 3, the adventurers arrive in the fishing village and quickly discover that the poor and degenerate folk may have a secret to hide. The adventurers may choose to investigate deeper, possibly coming to blows with the villagers, or spend their time preparing for the attack they believe will soon occur.": "在第三部分中，冒险家们到达了渔村，并很快发现这些贫穷堕落的人们可能有一个秘密要隐藏。冒险家们可以选择深入调查，可能会与村民发生冲突，或者花时间为他们认为即将发生的攻击做准备。",
	"Part 4 details the penultimate portion of the adventure. The Cult of the Dragon attacks the village and the adventurers either succeed in disrupting that attack, or they are captured and taken to Ixas' ship by his kobold minions.": "第四部分详细介绍了冒险的倒数第二部分。神龙教袭击了村庄，冒险者要么成功地破坏了这次袭击，要么被伊克萨斯的爪牙抓到并带到了他的船上。",

	"The adventurers have answered a call to come to Valhingen Graveyard and speak with Doomguide Yovir Glandon, the high priest of {@deity Kelemvor|forgotten realms|PHB} (the lawful neutral god of death). Yovir has heard the rumors of the \"ghost ship\" attacking coastal communities and is worried that it will eventually come to Phlan. Between his Order's hatred for undead, and his civic concern, Yovir is looking for a group of able-bodied adventurers to tackle this challenge. The Order of Silent Shroud is neutral in city politics, and thus he has decided to sidestep any normal city bureaucracy and act directly before the threat finds its way to the city's doorstep.": "冒险家们响应号召，来到Valhingen墓地，与{@deity Kelemvor|forgotten realms|PHB}（合法中立的死亡之神）的大祭司Yovir Glandon交谈。尤维尔听说了 \"幽灵船 \"袭击沿海社区的传言，并担心它最终会来到普兰。在他的骑士团对亡灵的憎恨和他的公民关怀之间，尤维尔正在寻找一群身体健康的冒险者来应对这一挑战。沉默的裹尸布骑士团在城市政治中是中立的，因此他决定避开任何正常的城市官僚机构，在威胁到达城市的门口之前直接采取行动。",
	"Yovir Glandon has toiled in the gardens of Valhingen for nearly 40 years. But despite his dirty, calloused hands and his grass-stained robes, he is a learned man. Yovir is a reserved man, who lets others steer the course of a conversation; interjecting only where necessary. He has little interest in the politics of Phlan, but does wish the best for its people.": "Yovir Glandon已经在Valhingen的花园里工作了近40年。但是，尽管他的手很脏，长满了老茧，长袍上也沾满了草，但他是一个博学的人。尤维尔是个保守的人，他让别人引导谈话的进程；只有在必要时才插话。他对普兰岛的政治没有什么兴趣，但他希望普兰岛的人民得到最好的待遇。",
	"The sun shines brightly in the graveyard as you approach the grey robed man, working in the dirt. He turns the dirt with a small hand trowel; several pots of flowers next to him. Without looking up, he speaks with an even voice, \"I am so glad you answered my call for aid. If all is as I fear, time may be short. Let us talk quickly.\"": "当你走近那个在泥土中工作的灰袍人时，墓地里阳光明媚。他用一把小铲子翻动泥土；旁边放着几盆花。他没有抬头，用平和的声音说：\"我很高兴你回应了我的援助呼吁。如果一切如我所担心的那样，时间可能很短。让我们赶紧谈谈。\"",
	"Doomguide Yovir introduces himself, thanks the adventurers for coming and then quickly gets the reason for his call for help. There are rumors of a \"ghost ship\" attacking small villages and lone farms or inns on the northern coast of the Moonsea, moving up the Iron Route toward Phlan from Zhentil Keep. No one seems moved to act and the danger draws ever nearer to Phlan.": "厄运之神尤维尔介绍了自己，感谢冒险者们的到来，然后迅速了解了他的求助原因。有传言说，一艘 \"幽灵船 \"正在袭击月海北岸的小村庄和孤独的农场或旅店，沿着铁路线从真蒂尔堡向弗兰移动。似乎没有人愿意采取行动，而危险离弗兰越来越近了。",

	"Yesterday, a man from a small unnamed hamlet two days southwest of Phlan was picked up just outside of the city. Raving about a dracolich, and seemingly insane, the man was delivered into the care of the Kelemvorites. The man's mind is gone and it will take some time for him to recover if he ever does at all. The clerics have the man at their temple if they wish to examine him or attempt a conversation.": "昨天，一个来自普兰西南两天的无名小村庄的男子在城外被抓获。这名男子对着一只龙卷风大喊大叫，而且似乎精神错乱，被送到了凯勒莫尔人的照料下。这个人的脑子已经坏了，如果他能恢复的话，也需要一些时间。教士们把这个人放在他们的寺庙里，如果他们想对他进行检查或试图进行交谈的话。",
	"There have been reports that a ghost ship has been haunting the Stormy Bay coast, destroying small villages and homesteads.": "有报告称，一艘鬼船一直在暴风湾海岸出没，摧毁了小村庄和家园。",
	"Yovir knows that the Knights of the Black Fist are also concerned about the situation, given that the attacks appear to be moving in the direction of Phlan and it is possible that eventually it will attack the city.": "尤维尔知道，黑拳骑士团也在关注这一情况，因为攻击似乎正朝着普兰的方向发展，有可能最终会攻击城市。",
	"While keeping a nominal eye on the approaching danger, they are not preparing as much as Yovir believes they should. The Knights did task one of their number (Aleyd Burral) with gathering information about the attacks.": "虽然名义上保持着对即将到来的危险的关注，但他们并没有像约维尔认为的那样进行准备。骑士们确实给他们中的一个人（Aleyd Burral）布置了任务，收集有关袭击的信息。",
	"Since the Kelemvorites are specifically neutral in the intricate web of city politics, Doomguide Yovir was motivated to act; fearing the arguing disparare groups will not be able to agree and acr in time to prevent the danger from coming to Phlan. In addition, rumors of ghosts and liches have disturbed Yovir. These sorts of powerful undead are extremely rare, but unfortunately have not been all that uncommon in the Moonsea. The followers of Kelemvor are staunch enemies of the undead and if they do exist, Yovir, wants them stamped out.": "由于Kelemvorites在错综复杂的城市政治网络中是特别中立的，所以Doomguide Yovir有了采取行动的动机；担心争论不休的disparare团体无法及时达成一致和acr，以防止危险降临到Phlan。此外，关于鬼魂和地衣的传言也让Yovir感到不安。这类强大的亡灵极为罕见，但不幸的是，在月海也不是那么少见。Kelemvor的追随者是亡灵的坚定敌人，如果他们真的存在，Yovir希望他们被铲除。",
	"Doomguide Yovir suggests that the party begin by gathering information in Phlan about the attacks, specifically speaking with the recovering madman at the temple of Kelemvor or seeking out Aleyd Burral of the Knights of the Black Fist. From there they can follow up other leads, possibly taking them outside of the city. If the adventurers have any contacts in the cities (their factions), Yovir also encourages the adventurers to consult with them to determine if they knwo anything helpful. He also suggests they return to him if they have any further questions.": "厄运之神尤维尔建议他们首先在普兰收集有关袭击的信息，特别是与凯勒莫神庙中正在恢复的疯子交谈，或者寻找黑拳骑士团的阿莱德-伯拉尔。在那里，他们可以跟进其他的线索，可能会把他们带到城外。如果冒险者在城市里有任何联系人（他们的派别），尤维尔也鼓励冒险者向他们咨询，以确定他们是否知道任何有用的信息。他还建议，如果他们有任何进一步的问题，可以回来找他。",
	"If the adventurers inquire about payment, Yovir suggest that altough he has no coin to give as payment, adventurers often lead to wealth and glory that the adventurers might acquire through their own deeds. He will, however, give them two {@item potion of healing||potions of healing} that they might use in their efforts. They are welcome to keep the potions if they are not used during the adventure. Yovir has also arranged riding horses and rooms for the adventurers at the Laughing Goblin Inn where they may stay tonight. The horses are a loan and are not theirs to keep. If lost or stolen, they will have to repay their cost.": "如果冒险者询问报酬问题，尤维尔表示，虽然他没有硬币作为报酬，但冒险者往往能带来财富和荣耀，而冒险者可能通过自己的行为获得这些财富和荣耀。然而，他将给他们两个{@item potion of healing||potions of healing}，他们可以在他们的努力中使用。如果在冒险过程中没有使用这些药水，欢迎他们保留。尤维尔还为冒险者们安排了马匹，并在笑妖精旅馆为他们安排了房间，他们今晚可以住在那里。这些马是借来的，他们不能保留。如果丢失或被盗，他们将不得不偿还其费用。",
	"If there are any acolytes or clerics of Kelemvor in the party, the group receives one additional {@item potion of healing} to take on their journey. (Not one per member of the faith.)": "如果队伍中有任何凯勒莫的圣徒或牧师，队伍就会得到一个额外的（%0%），以在他们的旅程中使用。(不是每个信仰的成员都有一个。)",
	"During their investigation, it is possible that some parties will want to leave Phlan as soon as possible or might refuse to leave at all, thinking it better to wait and defend the city should the attacks come. Use visits from Doomguide Yovir Glandon to keep them on track or help guide them as necessary.": "在他们的调查过程中，有些人可能会想尽快离开弗兰，或者根本就拒绝离开，认为最好等待，并在攻击来临时保卫城市。利用末日守卫者尤维尔-格兰登的访问，让他们走上正轨，或在必要时帮助指导他们。",
	"Doomguide Yovir gives the adventurers two {@item potion of healing||potions of healing} (one additional if any acoyltes or clerics of Kelemvor are present) for agreeing to help out.": "末日守卫者尤维尔因为同意帮忙而给了冒险者两个{@item potion of healing||potions of healing}(如果有任何acoyltes或Kelemvor的神职人员在场，则额外给一个)。",
	"Following the directions given to them by Yovir, the adventurers can easily find themselves at the Temple of Kelemvor.": "按照尤维尔给他们的指示，冒险家们可以很容易地在凯勒莫尔神庙找到自己。",
	"A disheveled man with wild hair is tied to a chair in front of an open window. Deep, scabbed scratches cover his face and his hands are wrapped with bloody bandages. His eyes dart around the room almost without seeing, mumbling to himself.": "一个头发乱糟糟的男人被绑在一扇打开的窗户前的椅子上。他的脸上覆盖着深深的、结痂的抓痕，手上缠着血淋淋的绷带。他的眼睛在房间里转来转去，几乎看不见，喃喃自语。",
	"A young acolyte in grey robes changes linens on a nearby bed with restraints dangling from its sides.": "一个穿着灰色长袍的年轻圣徒在附近的床上更换床单，床的两侧挂着束缚带。",
	"The boy nods at your entrance, \"You may call me Elden, gentle masters. If you have any questions, I have seen to the man's care for since last night.\"": "男孩在你进来时点点头，\"你可以叫我艾尔登，温柔的主人。如果你们有任何问题，我从昨晚开始就一直在照顾这个人。\"",
	"Acolyte Elden Mymn is a young human male with a passive, patient demeanor. He is quiet and easily overlooked in the background. He is fervent in his beliefs, but as he is only just beginning his training, he thinks it better to defer to his elders.": "圣徒艾尔登-米姆是一个年轻的人类男性，举止被动、耐心。他很安静，很容易被人忽略在后台。他对自己的信仰很狂热，但由于他的训练才刚刚开始，他认为最好听从长辈的意见。",
	"Elden explains that the man is given to bouts of violence, though mostly towards himself and thus the restraints. He has clawed his face, and later began to chew off his own fingers when Elden tried to stop the man from hurting himself. Elden strongly discourages removing the restraints saying that it took several of the brothers to hold him down last time.": "埃尔登解释说，这个人有暴力倾向，虽然主要是对他自己，因此有束缚。他曾用爪子抓自己的脸，后来当艾尔登试图阻止这个人伤害自己时，他开始咬断自己的手指。埃尔登强烈反对解除束缚，说上次是好几个兄弟才按住他的。",
	"Elden has overheard the man speak of the \"eyes of the dracolich\" and his village being destroyed, but little beyond that. No one knows who the man is, or exactly what happened, only that his mind seems gone.": "艾尔登听到这个人说到 \"龙卷风的眼睛 \"和他的村庄被摧毁，但除此之外就没有什么了。没有人知道这个人是谁，也没有人知道到底发生了什么，只知道他的思想似乎消失了。",
	"The man simply arrived in the graveyard yesterday, having wandered in on the road from the west, bearing wounds that already appeared to be at least one day old.": "这个人是昨天才来到墓地的，他从西边的路上走过来，身上的伤口似乎已经至少有一天了。",
	"Shortly after the man arrived, a female Black Fist knight with closely cropped blonde hair streaked with gray came and attempted to interview the man. It did not go very well. The man began raving loudly shortly after the knight attempted to question him. Eventually he began barking like a dog and tried to bite the knight before she gave up and left.": "这名男子到达后不久，一名紧剪金发、满头灰发的黑拳女骑士前来，试图采访该男子。事情进行得并不顺利。骑士试图询问他后不久，该男子开始大声咆哮。最后，他开始像狗一样吠叫，并试图咬骑士，然后她放弃了，离开了。",
	"The clerics have taken to calling the man Yip, due to the yipping, barking noise he frequently makes.": "教士们已经习惯于称呼这个人为Yip，因为他经常发出睆睆的叫声。",
	"The madman, Yip, is quiet and uninterested when the adventurers first arrive, but speaking with him is a trying process. He punctuates most of what he says with a barking, yip noise and other nervous ticks while struggling against his bonds. He never answers a straight question, and becomes more and more frustrated and agitated the more he is interacted with.": "疯子阿叶在冒险家们刚到时很安静，也不感兴趣，但和他说话是一个很艰难的过程。他说的大部分话都是用吠叫声和其他紧张的抽动声来标点，同时挣扎着反抗他的束缚。他从不直接回答问题，而且越是与他互动，他就越是感到沮丧和焦躁。",
	"Yip does not respond to questions asking his name or who he is, but rather just repeats, \"The eyes, the eyes of the dracolich, it sees me... It is coming...\"": "叶没有回答问他的名字或他是谁的问题，而只是重复说：\"眼睛，龙卷风的眼睛，它看到我......。它要来了......\"",
	"If examined, it is clear that he is deeply tanned and has rough hands with dirt under his nails. He is likely a farmer or other outdoor laborer. He has several wounds that have been dressed as well. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) or Intelligence (Investigation) check can determine that one is a cut by a small bladed weapon, and two others are badly bruised contusions from some blunt object.": "如果进行检查，可以清楚地看到他被深深地晒黑了，双手粗糙，指甲里有污垢。他很可能是一个农民或其他户外劳动者。他身上有几处伤口，也被包扎过。成功通过DC15智慧（医学）或智力（调查）检查，可以确定其中一个是被小刃武器划伤的，另外两个是被钝器严重擦伤的挫伤。",
	"If asked how he came to be here Yip says \"the smalls shambled wet before the eyes, clack, clack, yip, the ghost ship, fog, yip. Blood, and flame, yip, village no more, yip, yip.\"": "如果问他是如何来到这里的，叶说：\"小家伙们在眼前晃来晃去，咔嚓，咔嚓，yip，鬼船，雾，yip。血，和火焰，yip，村庄不再，yip，yip。\"",
	"Yip speaks only Common.": "叶氏只说普通话。",
	"After being asked three questions, Yip devolves into yipping and struggling; biting anyone who comes too close to his mouth. This does no actual damage, but is a painful reminder that the man is not right in the head.": "在被问到三个问题后，叶某开始大叫和挣扎；咬住任何离他的嘴太近的人。这并没有造成实际伤害，但却痛苦地提醒人们，这个人的脑子不正常。",
	"Should the adventurers go looking for the Knight of the Black Fist investigating the attacks, they are quickly directed to a guard station where Knight Aleyd Burral awaits them.": "如果冒险者去寻找调查袭击事件的黑拳骑士，他们很快就会被引导到一个警卫站，阿莱德-伯拉尔骑士在那里等着他们。",
	"With only the slightest of effort, you are directed to a harried looking human woman wearing the uniform of a Black Fist Knight. Streaks of grey in her blonde hair frame a face with the hard-won lines of advancing age and a violent life. Turning a stern gaze upon you, she offers, \"I understand that you have been looking for me. How may I assist you, citizens?\"": "只需最轻微的努力，你就会被引导到一个身穿黑拳骑士制服的、看起来很苦恼的人类妇女面前。她的金发中夹杂着灰色的条纹，脸上有着因年龄增长和暴力生活而产生的来之不易的线条。她用严厉的目光看着你，说：\"我知道你一直在找我。有什么需要我帮助的吗，公民们？\"",
	"Knight Aleyd Burral is a formidable warrior with a keen mind, but the soft heart she hides under a stern frown has kept from advancing further in the Knights of the Black Fist. In her late 40s with grey-streaked blonde hair, she has decided that doing her job well and protecting Phlan is perhaps more important than advancement. She does not suffer fools and counts adventurers among the most foolish of all.": "骑士Aleyd Burral是一个强大的战士，有着敏锐的头脑，但她隐藏在严厉的眉头下的柔软的心，使她在黑拳骑士团中没有进一步的发展。40多岁的她有着一头灰白的金发，她认为做好自己的工作和保护普兰也许比升职更重要。她不受愚弄，并把冒险者算作最愚蠢的人之一。",
	"When adventurers first arrive, Aleyd is a little concerned about conversing with random adventurers and directly questions the adventurers about their motivations until they give a plausible story or simply tell her they work for Doomguide Yovir, at which point she relaxes. Aleyd respects the Kelemvorite for his civic concern while avoiding city politics.": "当冒险者刚到时，阿莱伊德有点担心与随机的冒险者交谈，并直接询问冒险者的动机，直到他们给出一个合理的故事或简单地告诉她他们为末日向导尤维尔工作，这时她就会放松。阿莱德尊重凯勒莫里特人的公民关怀，同时避免城市政治。",
	"Aleyd explains that she has been looking into the attacks and can list each occurrence (the madman's village two days ago, Vig's Dock six days ago, a collection of farm houses ten days ago, and the Aleston brewery fourteen days previous). She is worried that eventually the attacks will come to Phlan, but while she was able to convince her superiors to allow her to investigate, they are not concerned. Phlan is large, and all the attacks have occurred in small villages or lone homes. She has noticed a pattern in the attacks (every four nights), but hasn't put together any reason for that sequence. The travel time between each attack is approximately one or two days, so it must be something beyond just the time it takes to travel from one spot to the next.": "阿莱德解释说，她一直在调查这些袭击，并能列出每一次发生的事件（两天前的疯子村，六天前的维格码头，十天前的农舍集合，以及十四天前的艾利斯顿啤酒厂）。她担心最终这些袭击会降临到普兰，但虽然她能够说服她的上级允许她进行调查，但他们并不担心。普兰岛很大，所有的攻击都发生在小村庄或孤独的家庭。她注意到这些袭击有一个模式（每四个晚上一次），但还没有拼凑出这一序列的任何原因。每次袭击之间的旅行时间大约是一到两天，所以它一定是超越了从一个地方到另一个地方的旅行时间。",
	"She has the following specific details she can offer in response to the adventurer's questions:": "她在回答冒险家的问题时，可以提供以下具体细节。",
	"There are no witnesses beyond the madman, but it seems likely by when the ruined villages were found that all of the attacks occurred at night. If pressed, she admits this is purely supposition.": "除了这个疯子之外，没有其他证人，但从发现废墟村庄的时间来看，所有的攻击似乎都发生在晚上。如果被追问，她承认这纯粹是推测。",
	"She has investigated the last site personally, but only interviewed travelers in Phlan that passed through the first, second and third locations. In all cases, the village appears to have been ransacked and burned. Not much appeared to have been taken, if anything, but it was impossible to tell for certain due to the fire and lack of survivors.": "她曾亲自调查过最后一个地点，但只采访过经过第一、第二和第三地点的普兰市旅行者。在所有情况下，村庄似乎都被洗劫一空并被烧毁。如果有的话，似乎没有拿走多少东西，但由于火灾和缺乏幸存者，无法确定。",
	"For the nearby village that she visited personally, she found several old bones that she took to a local healer by the name of Fillistrom Wunderkundoodle. The aging gnome said they appeared to be human \"filla-something.\" Oddly, most of the tracks she found (both skeletal and booted) seemed to be small sized, like that of a human child.": "对于她亲自走访的附近村庄，她发现了几具老骨头，她把它们带到了当地一位名叫Fillistrom Wunderkundoodle的医者那里。这位年迈的地精说，它们似乎是人类的 \"filla-something\"。奇怪的是，她发现的大多数足迹（包括骨架和脚印）似乎都很小，就像人类的孩子。",
	"If the pattern holds, the next attack should occur in less than two days, and in six days whatever the threat is, it might reach Phlan.": "如果模式保持不变，下一次攻击应该在两天以内发生，而在六天内，无论威胁是什么，都可能到达弗兰。",
	"She has no idea where the next raid will occur, but it should be a day's ride from Phlan somewhere along the coast. There are no villages there, but maybe there is some cottage or farm she is unaware of. (This is enough information to search along the coast for the ferry landing, though the adventurers may not know it.)": "她不知道下一次突袭会在哪里发生，但应该是离弗兰一天的路程，沿着海岸的某个地方。那里没有村庄，但也许有一些她不知道的山寨或农场。(这些信息足以让我们沿着海岸线寻找渡口，尽管冒险家们可能不知道）。",
	"She asks to be kept informed of the party's progress, and sternly encourages them to be mindful of Phlan's laws while they continue their investigation. While she likes Yovir, there is nothing he can do to protect them should they break the law.": "她要求随时了解党的进展情况，并严厉地鼓励他们在继续调查时要注意普兰的法律。虽然她喜欢尤维尔，但如果他们违反了法律，他也无能为力保护他们。",
	"At some point it is likely that the players will want to research the regular timing of the attacks. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) notes that the attacks correspond roughly to changes in the phase of the moon. Worshippers of Selune, goddess of the moon, receive advantage on this roll.": "在某些时候，玩家很可能想要研究这些攻击的常规时间。一个成功的DC20智力（自然）测试表明，这些攻击与月相的变化大致相符。月亮女神塞卢娜的崇拜者在这个测试中获得优势。",
	"If the adventurers are unable to discern a pattern, they can employ a sage to look into it. For 2 sp, the sage Delacrae Gentleblossom (female half-elf) of the store All Questions Answered, will spend five hours looking into the pattern of the raids. After that time, she determines that all of the attacks are between the coast and the Iron Route, the old major trading road from Zhentil Keep to Phlan and beyond. The travel time on the road between the location of each attack is approximately one day and even the slowest traveler going only under cover of darkness would make it two days; even with the inclement weather of Stormy Bay lashing at them and muddying the roads. The only settlement between Phlan and the last attack that is also near the coast is a small fishing village on a tiny island just a short ferry ride into Stormy Bay.": "如果冒险者无法辨别模式，他们可以雇佣一位贤者来调查。所有问题都得到解答的商店的圣人德拉克雷-温柔花（女性半精灵）将花5个小时来研究袭击的模式，费用为2sp。在那之后，她确定所有的袭击都发生在海岸和铁路线之间，铁路线是从Zhentil Keep到Phlan和其他地方的古老主要贸易道路。每次袭击地点之间的路途时间大约是一天，即使是最慢的旅行者在黑暗的掩护下也能走两天；即使风暴湾的恶劣天气对他们造成了冲击，使道路变得泥泞不堪。在弗兰和最后一次袭击之间，唯一靠近海岸的定居点是一个小岛上的小渔村，只需乘坐短途渡轮就能进入暴风雨湾。",
	"As for the pattern of the attacks, the phase of the moon does change in a little less than every four days, and so far the strikes match the nights when there was a change in the phase of the moon.": "至于攻击的模式，月相确实在每四天不到的时间内发生变化，到目前为止，攻击与月相发生变化的夜晚相匹配。",
	"Should the adventurers have more questions they wish answered, perhaps because they are having trouble putting the disparate pieces together, Delacrae can do further research for another 2 sp and five hours. The price becomes 1 gp if they wish her to work through the night hours because the party is in a rush.": "如果冒险者有更多的问题希望得到解答，也许是因为他们难以将不同的碎片拼凑在一起，德拉克雷可以再做进一步的研究，费用为2sp和5小时。如果他们希望她在夜间工作，因为他们很匆忙，价格就变成了1戈比。",
	"Delacrae becomes another useful tool for the Dungeon Master to help the adventurers, particularly if the players are having trouble with their investigation.": "德拉克雷成为地下城管理员帮助冒险者的另一个有用的工具，特别是当玩家在调查中遇到困难时。",
	"If the adventurers wish to follow-up with the healer that Knight Aleyd Burral spoke with, they are directed to his shop.": "如果冒险者希望与阿列伊德-布拉尔骑士交谈的治疗师进行跟踪，他们会被引导到他的商店。",
	"A wooden board displaying a bandaged hand hangs in over a small storefront with window boxes full of flowers. A balding gnomish man with a crown of limp white hair is carefully pulling herbs from between the flowers and placing them into a small basket at his feet.": "一块木板上挂着一只缠着绷带的手，在一个小店面的窗台上摆满了鲜花。一个秃顶的地精，带着一顶软绵绵的白发，正小心翼翼地从花丛中拔出草药，放进他脚边的一个小篮子。",
	"Seeing the party's approach, Fillistrom sizes them up quickly as adventurers and offers to answer their questions for a consulting fee of 5 sp (though he is willing to negotiate down to 1 sp if the adventurers try). Once a fee is agreed upon, he invites them into his cramped shop. Books line the walls and various healing herbs hang from the ceiling as they dry.": "看到他们的到来，Fillistrom很快就把他们当成了冒险家，并愿意回答他们的问题，但要付给他们5仙的咨询费（不过如果冒险家们尝试的话，他愿意把价格降到1仙）。一旦谈妥费用，他就邀请他们进入他狭窄的店铺。墙上挂着书籍，天花板上挂着各种干燥的治疗草药。",
	"Fillistrom Wunderkundoodle is cranky male gnome with a penchant for taking his time. Fillistrom is a trained healer who studies the mysteries of the body and is a competent mundane healer for those without the means to afford magical remedies or with a distrust of the magic.": "菲利斯特罗姆-伍德昆杜尔是个脾气暴躁的男地精，喜欢慢慢来。菲利斯特罗姆是一名训练有素的治疗师，他研究身体的奥秘，是一名合格的世俗治疗师，为那些没有能力支付魔法疗法或对魔法不信任的人服务。",
	"Fillistrom readily admits that the bones that the knight brought him appeared to be phalanges (toe bones) from an adult human. They are quite old, and are stained from where muscle and skin rotted atop them. If the adventurers wish to see them he can produce them. Digging in a nearby trunk, he pulls out a jar with a few small bones.": "菲利斯特罗姆欣然承认，骑士带给他的骨头似乎是成年人类的趾骨（脚趾骨）。它们相当古老，上面的肌肉和皮肤腐烂后留下了污点。如果冒险者希望看到它们，他可以出示它们。他在附近的树干里挖出一个装有几块小骨头的罐子。",
	"The bones do not radiate magic.": "骨头不会放射出魔法。",
	"Looking closely at them and success in a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices a sticky residue on several of the bones. It appears to be some kind of natural adhesive, possibly a tree sap (This is left over from when the kobolds stuck the bones to their costumes.)": "仔细观察它们，并在DC10智慧（感知）检查中取得成功，一个角色注意到几块骨头上有一种粘性的残留物。这似乎是某种天然的粘合剂，可能是树的汁液（这是哥布林把骨头粘在衣服上时留下的）。",
	"The bones were ones that the kobolds gathered from random corpses they dug up. If magic is used to determine the owners of the bones or cause of death, they are three different corpses who died of natural causes.": "这些骨头是哥布林从他们挖出的随机尸体上收集的。如果用魔法来确定骨头的主人或死因，它们是三具不同的尸体，死于自然原因。",
	"Those adventurers who are members of the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, or the Lords' Alliance can take advantage of their organization's network of informants to gain additional information and assignments.": "那些身为高塔骑士团、翡翠飞地或领主联盟成员的冒险者可以利用他们组织的线人网络来获得更多的信息和任务。",

The Emerald Enclave have determined that something unnatural is going on with the weather and storms seem to spring up every four days, corresponding directly with changes in the phase of the moon. Whatever is doing it is disrupting both ships and some of the sea life.": "翡翠飞地的成员能够联系到隐居的Seranolla the Whisperer（女森林地精），她要求在城外的树林里见面。翡翠飞地已经确定，天气正在发生一些非自然的变化，风暴似乎每四天就会出现一次，与月相的变化直接对应。不管是什么原因，都会扰乱船只和一些海洋生物。",

	"Once the adventurers have enough information to proceed out of Phlan towards the suspected site of the next raid, they have three brief encounters on the road before making it yo the fishing village. This part assumes the adventurers spent the night in Phlan and left the morning of the sixteenth day. If that is not the case, the Dungeon Master may need to alter the descriptions of light and the gathering storm as appropriate.": "一旦冒险家们有了足够的信息，就可以离开普兰，前往下一次突袭的可疑地点，他们在路上有三次短暂的遭遇，然后就到了渔村。这一部分假设冒险者在弗兰过夜，并在第十六天早上离开。如果不是这样，地下城管理员可能需要适当地改变对光线和风暴的描述。",
	"The Iron Route, the main road along the north side of the Moonsea runs all the way from Zhentil Keep to Phlan and beyond.

	"Gilfron Milon is a friendly male human merchant who deals in lumber from the Quivering Forest and tools. While he is pleasant, he is no fool and knows the roads are dangerous, leaving him cautious at the outset of any meeting.

	"Gilfron is friendly, but both father and son are wary when a large group of armed travelers approach them. As soon as it becomes clear the adventurers are no threat, they happily invite them to share a midday meal. Should the adventurers instead choose to threaten him, Gilfron tells his son to run while he does his best to distract the brutes, though he is no threat.": "Gilfron很友好，但当一大群武装的旅行者接近他们时，父子俩都很警惕。一旦发现这些冒险者没有威胁，他们就高兴地邀请他们一起吃中午饭。如果冒险者选择威胁他，吉尔弗伦让他的儿子跑，而他则尽力引开这些野蛮人，尽管他没有威胁。",

	"Recently he has seen a lot of raided villages and homes. At the village just two days away he saw the ruins still smoldering like all the others. He avoided going into the ruined villages, not knowing if there are raiders about. All of the homes and villagers were there and occupied when he passed the other way three months ago, but he saw no living souls this time": "最近他看到了很多被袭击的村庄和房屋。在两天前的村庄，他看到废墟仍像其他村庄一样在冒烟。他避免进入废墟上的村庄，不知道是否有突击队员在附近。三个月前他经过另一条路时，所有的房屋和村民都在那里，并且有人居住，但这次他没有看到活的灵魂。",
	"The only sign of civilization the pair saw was the island ferry abbout a day back. The fisher folk have always been a strange and isolated kin who don't much mix with others, but he spoke with the boatman and loosened his tongue with a new hammer and some nails that the man needed to use to repair his ferry. The boatman said he was more worried about the storm coming in the next day or so, than he was about any rumors of a dracolich haunting they area. Gilfron notes that in Stormy Bay, storms coming in off the sea are all too common. Unded dragons are not.": "这对夫妇看到的唯一文明迹象是一天前的岛上渡船。渔民一直是一个奇怪的、与世隔绝的亲属，他们不怎么和别人混在一起，但他和船夫交谈，用一把新锤子和一些钉子松开了他的舌头，那人需要用这些钉子来修理他的渡船。船夫说他更担心第二天左右的风暴，而不是担心任何关于龙卷风在他们地区出没的传言。Gilfron指出，在暴风雨湾，从海上来的风暴太常见了。而龙则不然。",
	"Worried for his boy, Gilfron further enquired as to why the boatmen had mentioned a dracolich, the strange man gave him a long stare and said that there has been plague of those with fragile minds of late, spouting such tales. In fact his island village sheltered one such soul now who had wandered to the ferry stop two days ago. The man had seen something that has made him lose his mind and spout on about the 'eyes of the Dracolich' watching him wear ever he goes. The boatman felt that the vagrant was clearly weak and confused.": "吉尔弗伦为他的孩子担心，进一步询问船夫为什么会提到龙卷风，那个奇怪的人盯着他看了很久，说最近有很多头脑脆弱的人在说这种故事。事实上，他所在的岛村现在收容了一个这样的灵魂，他两天前曾徘徊在渡口。这个人看到了一些东西，使他失去了理智，并大谈 \"德拉科里奇的眼睛 \"看着他走过的地方。船夫觉得这个流浪者显然很虚弱，很困惑。",
	"At the age of 10, Gilmont is used to his father doing most of the talking and instead tends to watch from the background. Should an adventurer approach him for his side of a story, he confirms much of what his father says, but notes one additional detail. As they drove away, he noted that the boatman made a strange digging-lake gesture with his left hand, sort of like pointing towards the ground with his pinkies and forefinger. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows the adventurer to recognize the gesture as typically used in spells that protect against creatures from other planes. By itself, the gesture does nothing and possesses no magic": "在10岁的时候，吉尔蒙已经习惯了他的父亲做大部分的谈话，而是倾向于在后台观看。如果有冒险者向他询问他的故事，他就会证实他父亲所说的大部分内容，但会注意到一个额外的细节。当他们开车离开时，他注意到船夫用他的左手做了一个奇怪的挖湖的手势，有点像用小指和食指指着地面。如果成功通过DC15智力（阿卡纳）检查，冒险者就能认出这个手势通常用于保护来自其他星球的生物的法术。这个手势本身没有任何作用，也不具备任何魔力。",
	"If any of the adventurers are willing to help Gilfron repair his wagon, he is greatly appreciative. He does not have a spare, but there are ample trees and he does have woodworking tools. A successful DC 15 Strength check can rig a temporary repair that should see him to Phlan.": "如果有冒险者愿意帮助吉尔弗隆修理他的马车，他将非常感激。他没有备用车，但有充足的树木，他也有木工工具。如果成功地进行DC15力量检查，就可以进行临时性的修理，应该可以把他送到普兰。",
	"If helped in this way, he is only too happy to accept any business offers from members of the Lords'Alliance.": "如果以这种方式得到帮助，他非常乐意接受领主联盟成员的任何商业提议。",
	"Before night falls, a stiff wind that smells of rain whips up and the adventurers cross paths with a mother wolf and her cubs.": "在夜幕降临之前，一股带着雨腥味的劲风呼啸而来，冒险家们与一只母狼和它的幼崽擦肩而过。",
	"A high pitch yipping accompanied by a rustling in a roadside bushes is the only warning you get before a wolf pup runs into the road ahead of you. It is followed a heartbeat later by a second pup that tackles the first in the road.": "一声高亢的叫声伴随着路边灌木丛中的沙沙声，是你在一只狼崽子跑到你前面的路上之前得到的唯一警告。紧随其后的是第二只狼崽，它们将第一只狼崽扑倒在路上。",
	"The heartwarming roughhousing is broken by the sound of a deep and much louder growling from behind you.": "你身后传来的低沉而又响亮的咆哮声打破了这一温馨的粗暴对待。",
	"The wolf pups were playing, and one has chased the other out of the bushes where it finally caught its sibling. Wrestling in the road, they are unaware of the adventurers who stand only 15 feet away. Unfortunately for the adventurers, the mother {@creature dire wolf} has caught scent of the adventurers and moved quietly in their direction in the hedges 10 feet behind the party.": "狼崽子们正在玩耍，其中一只把另一只赶出了灌木丛，它终于抓住了它的兄弟姐妹。它们在路上摔跤，对站在15英尺外的冒险者毫无察觉。对冒险者来说，不幸的是，母狼{@creature dire wolf}已经闻到了冒险者的气味，并在他们身后10英尺的树篱里悄悄地向他们的方向移动。",
	"Any adventurer riding a mount that is not trained for war (such as the riding horses provided by Yovir) must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check as the animal catches the scent of the mother wolf. Failure on this check means that that adventurer's horse rears up in panic and throws its rider unless that adventurer also succeeds at a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. An adventurer who is thrown from their horse suffers 4 ({@dice 1d8}) bludgeoning damage.": "任何冒险者骑着没有经过战争训练的坐骑（例如尤维尔提供的骑马），在动物捕捉到母狼的气味时，必须成功地进行DC10智慧（动物处理）检查。如果检查失败，意味着该冒险者的马会惊慌失措地站起来，并把它的骑手扔出去，除非该冒险者也成功地进行了DC 10的灵巧救赎。被甩出马的冒险者会受到4({@dice 1d8})的重击伤害。",
	"The mother dire wolf has let out a warning growl, but given that the adventurers out number her and they are in between her pups and her, she has not yet attacked. Any attempt to move toward her or the pups causes the wolf to attack. Otherwise the adventurers can attempt to move away in a calm manner to avoid the combat. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) is needed to move away from the wolves without angering the wary mother further. If multiple adventurers try to calm her, she attacks if any of the adventurers fail.": "母狼发出了警告性的咆哮声，但鉴于冒险者的数量超过了它，而且它们处于幼狼和它之间，它还没有攻击。任何试图向她或幼狼移动的行为都会导致狼的攻击。否则，冒险者可以尝试以平静的方式离开，以避免战斗。要想远离狼群而不进一步激怒警惕的母狼，需要成功通过DC15智慧（动物处理）。如果多个冒险者试图安抚她，如果任何一个冒险者失败，她就会攻击。",
	"If a combat begins, the pups flee and the mother dire wolf attacks the nearest adventurer. One full round after the pups are clear, she also breaks and runs into the brush. If at any point someone attacks one of the pups or gives chase to them, the mother focuses solely on that individual to the detriment of her own safety and life.": "如果战斗开始，幼狼会逃跑，母狼会攻击最近的冒险者。在幼狼离开后的一整轮，它也会挣脱并跑进灌木丛中。如果在任何时候有人攻击幼狼或追赶它们，母狼就会只关注那个人，而不顾自己的安全和生命。",
	"The pups (AC 11) are noncombatants and are slain if they take 5 points or more of damage. They count as allies for the purpose of the mother dire wolf's pack tactics ability.": "幼狼（AC11）是非战斗人员，如果它们受到5点或更多的伤害就会被杀死。在母狼的群体战术能力中，它们算作盟友。",

	"The first morning since you left Phlan dawns very windy and drizzling. The sea churns with Umberlee's wrath and an elderly man with a wild beard, salt encrusted coat, and floppy hat struggles to bring a large flat bottomed raft to shore. He pulls arm-over-arm along a rope, which is strung between the shore and a small island an arrowshot into the bay.": "你离开弗兰后的第一个早晨，风很大，下着小雨。海水因翁贝里的愤怒而汹涌澎湃，一个留着野性胡须、身穿盐渍大衣、头戴软帽的老人奋力将一个大平底筏子带到岸上。他沿着一根绳子手拉手地拉着，绳子串在岸边和一个射入海湾的小岛之间。",
	"Warsh is a foul-tempered old man with one squinting eye and the other unnaturally bulging. He clenches a battered pipe between his teeth at all times, making it even harder to understand his already angry, mumbled speech. His family has lived on the island for five generations before him and he was there when the town made its pact with Tiamat. He is superstitious of outsiders, mean, and very greedy. It is also his job to deal with non-islanders. ": "沃什是一个脾气暴躁的老人，一只眼睛斜视，另一只眼睛不自然地鼓起来。他的牙齿间一直紧紧咬着一根破旧的烟斗，使人更难理解他已经愤怒的、喃喃自语的讲话。在他之前，他的家族已经在岛上生活了五代，当小镇与提亚马特达成协议时，他也在那里。他迷信外人，刻薄，而且非常贪婪。他的工作也是与非岛民打交道。",
	"Having seen the party approach, Warsh has brought the ferry from the island to see what they want. While he strongly recommends against anyone going to the island, he can always be bought for 1 gp a head and 1 sp for each mount, pet or livestock the adventurers may have with them.": "看到队伍走近，沃什从岛上带来了渡船，看看他们想要什么。虽然他强烈建议大家不要上岛，但他总能以1个金币一个人，以及冒险者可能带的每个坐骑、宠物或牲畜1个sp的价格买到。",

	"Warsh isn't especially interested in conversation, but if pressed he can offer a few dire words or mumbled insults before demanding the adventurers either pay him for passage or leave him to pull his way back to the island.": "沃什对谈话并不特别感兴趣，但如果被逼急了，他可以提供一些可怕的话语或喃喃自语的侮辱，然后要求冒险者要么支付他的旅费，要么让他自己想办法回到岛上去。",
	"An angry storm is coming. Someday the sea will claim its due and wash all of the ignorant shore folk into its depths.": "一场愤怒的风暴即将来临。总有一天，大海会索取它应得的东西，把所有无知的岸上人冲进它的深处。",
	"There is nothing to see on the island and no reason to visit the village. The adventurers should look elsewhere for their entertainment.": "岛上没有什么可看的，也没有理由去村里。冒险家们应该到其他地方去寻找他们的娱乐。",
	"If they insist on coming to the island, they will have to stay until after the storm passes to leave, as Warsh will not risk another trip until the seas calm.": "如果他们坚持要到岛上来，他们必须呆到风暴过后才能离开，因为在海面平静之前，沃什不会冒险再去。",
	"Warsh is suspicious of everyone including the madman they currently shelter, so if the adventurers ask about him, Warsh readily admits to having him on the island hoping the party means to take him away. Warsh describes the man as having the look of sailor about him, but raving about the \"eyes of the dracolich\" or other such nonsense. The man is otherwise healthy, so Warsh believes the man witnessed something his mind couldn't handle and snapped as opposed to someone who haswandered the wilderness in his insanity for a long time.": "沃什对每个人都很怀疑，包括他们目前庇护的那个疯子，所以如果冒险者问起他，沃什就欣然承认他在岛上，希望冒险者能把他带走。沃什描述说，这个人看起来像个水手，但却在大肆宣扬 \"德拉克人的眼睛 \"或其他类似的胡言乱语。这个人在其他方面都很健康，所以沃什认为这个人目睹了一些他的头脑无法处理的事情，于是就崩溃了，而不是一个长期在荒野上徘徊的疯子。",
	"Should the adventurers be unwilling or unable to pay Warsh, he leaves them stranded on the shore. He is willing to barter however, and he will take a good blade or some food or spirits in trade. If the adventurers still refuse his help, they can try to swim the distance, though it is clearly a fool's errand. It is 600 feet through stormy seas, requiring many successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to make it there.": "如果冒险者不愿意或无法支付沃什，他就会把他们搁浅在岸上。不过他愿意以物易物，他可以拿一把好刀或一些食物或烈酒作为交易。如果冒险者仍然拒绝他的帮助，他们可以尝试游过这段距离，尽管这显然是一件愚蠢的事情。这段距离有600英尺，需要多次成功的DC15力量（竞技）检查才能到达。",
	"The village has existed on the small island for generations, since before the times of the Spellplague, and all that time, the same families have lived there, intermingling such that it is hard to tell one line from another. The ever malignant degeneracy spread  through the populace, making them more and more debased until they could barely be called civilized. The villagers turned away from the worship of the gods, and instead offered their prayers to fiends from the Hells; fiends who would trade worship for very real power in the mortal realm. It was just unlucky that the pirate crew of the {@i Audacity} should choose this overlooked backwater for their redoubt, and they have paid for it for sixty years.": "这个村子已经在这个小岛上存在了好几代人，从咒语瘟疫时代之前就开始了，一直以来，同样的家族都生活在那里，相互交融，很难区分出一个家族和另一个家族。不断恶性退化的现象在民众中蔓延，使他们越来越堕落，直到他们几乎不能被称为文明人。村民们放弃了对神的崇拜，转而向来自地狱的恶魔祈祷；这些恶魔会用崇拜换取凡间的真正权力。％的海盗船员选择这个被忽视的落后地区作为他们的堡垒，这实在是太不走运了，他们已经为此付出了60年的代价。",
	"As the characters investigate or fortify the island, you do not need to refer to a map, or take too much time keeping track of how much time is spent at one location or another. After meeting with Elisande, who can serve as a guide and tool for you to assist the players, each adventurer or group of adventurers can investigate approximately one place in the late morning, one at midday and one in the afternoon. If an adventurer or group does something particularly brief and there is ample time, you may consider allowing them an additional encounter on the island. Once night falls, they may have plans, but Ixas' attack will preempt that. The characters may move as a group or split up to cover more ground, though danger may come more swiftly to those who are by themselves.": "在人物调查或加固岛屿的过程中，你不需要参考地图，也不需要花太多时间来记录在一个地方花费多少时间。在与埃利桑德见面后，他可以作为你协助玩家的向导和工具，每个冒险者或冒险者小组可以在上午晚些时候调查大约一个地方，在中午和下午各调查一个地方。如果一个冒险者或小组做的事情特别简短，而且时间充裕，你可以考虑让他们在岛上多遇到一次。一旦夜幕降临，他们可能会有计划，但伊克萨斯的攻击会抢先一步。角色们可以集体行动，也可以分头行动，以覆盖更多的地方，不过危险可能会更迅速地降临到那些独自行动的人身上。",
	"As the adventurers go to each area, they may choose to investigate the NPCs there, search the location, or even look for ways to prepare for the coming attack. Simply run each adventurer or group of adventurers once through a location-centered vignette and determine if the adventurers are meeting up, reapportioning groups, or proceeding on to the next round of investigations. This continues until each adventurer or group of adventurers have investigated three places. If the adventurers stay together, they are able to investigate a total of four places. If a player is concerned about being able to do enough with his or her adventurer, feel free to explain the time abstraction. It is very important to be aware of the amount of time spent in this part of the adventure; allowing the adventurers to investigate too much can cause the adventure to longer than neccessary.": "当冒险者去到每个区域时，他们可以选择调查那里的NPC，搜索该地点，甚至寻找方法为即将到来的攻击做准备。只需让每个冒险者或每组冒险者在以地点为中心的小插曲中运行一次，并确定冒险者是否会合，重新分配小组，或继续进行下一轮调查。这种情况一直持续到每个冒险者或每组冒险者都调查了三个地方。如果冒险家们呆在一起，他们总共可以调查四个地方。如果玩家担心他或她的冒险者能够做得足够多，可以随时解释时间的抽象性。注意在冒险的这一部分所花费的时间是非常重要的；允许冒险者调查太多，会使冒险的时间超过必要的时间。",
	"The villagers rarely interact with outsiders, and all of them speak an archaic dialect of Common, making them sometimes difficult to understand. All of them, even married couples, share a familial resemblance. They refer to themselves as Folk and non-islanders as Outsides.": "村民们很少与外人交流，他们都说一种古老的普通方言，使他们有时难以理解。所有的人，甚至是已婚夫妇，都有一种家族式的相似性。他们把自己称为民俗，把非岛民称为外人。",
	"When the characters first arrive on the island, read the following:": "当人物刚到岛上时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Trees block the view of the village from the landing, so your first sight of the village comes as you climb the wooded hill. It is underwhelming. It is little more than a collection of hovels, a barn, and a large centrally located fire pit. Dirty faces and wide eyes stare at you as you exit the rain soaked three line, before turning away. A grinning girl with wild dirty hair and a pock marked face runs up to you with obvious excitement. \"Who might ye be, Outsides?\"": "树木挡住了从登陆点看村子的视线，所以当你爬上树木茂盛的山头时，你就会看到村子的第一眼。它是令人沮丧的。它不过是一群小屋、一个谷仓和一个位于中央的大火坑。当你走出被雨淋湿的三条线时，脏兮兮的脸和大眼睛盯着你，然后转身离开。一个笑嘻嘻的女孩，头发乱糟糟的，脸上有麻子，明显兴奋地跑到你面前。\"你是谁，外人？\"",
	"Elisande has been waiting for a chance to escape the island for three years since her parents died in a sickness that tormented the village. At first she has hoped the madman would help her, but it was quickly clear that he would be no help-though he is fun to feed or throw stones at. Now that the adventurers have followed him here, there is another chance and she is not about to waste it.": "自从她的父母死于一场折磨村庄的疾病后，三年来，Elisande一直在等待一个机会逃离这个岛屿。起初她一直希望那个疯子能帮助她，但很快就发现他帮不上忙--虽然他喂食或扔石头都很有趣。现在，冒险家们跟随他来到这里，又有了一个机会，她不打算浪费这个机会。",
	"Use the {@creature commoner} statistics at the end of this Part if you should need stats for Elisande. She avoids combat, but will drag unconscious adventurers out of fights and attempt to stabilize them and makes Wisdom (Medicine) checks with a +2 bonus.": "如果你需要Elisande的数据，请使用本部分末尾的{@creature commoner}统计数据。她避免战斗，但会把昏迷的冒险者从战斗中拖出来，试图稳定他们的情绪，并以+2的奖励进行智慧（医学）检查。",
	"Elisande is a 12-year old orphan human girl, and village troublemaker. She is fascinated with outsiders, having heard tales that there is a land beyond the island that she yearns to visit now that she has no family left alive. She has no knowledge of the village's past beyond folklore, but is happy to show the adventurers around and answer questions hoping they will take her with them when they leave. She has few morals and due to her upbringing, no true concept of right or wrong.": "埃利桑德是一个12岁的人类孤儿，也是村里的麻烦制造者。她对外来者很着迷，听说岛外有一片土地，她现在已经没有活着的家人了，她渴望去那里。除了民间传说，她对村子的过去一无所知，但她很乐意带冒险家们参观，并回答他们的问题，希望他们离开时能带着她。她没有什么道德观，由于她的成长经历，她没有真正的是非观念。",
	"Initially none of the villagers are especially interested in speaking with the adventurers, regardless of what they have to say. They simply stare at them with a mixture of fear and anger. Only Elisande is friendly and eager to speak with them. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check confirms that her interest and friendhip is genuine, but she clearly wants something from them. She can relate the following about the island, at least as she knows them:": "起初，没有一个村民对与冒险家交谈特别感兴趣，不管他们说什么。他们只是怀着恐惧和愤怒的心情盯着他们。只有埃利桑德对他们很友好，渴望与他们交谈。成功通过DC10智慧（洞察力）检查，证实她的兴趣和友谊是真诚的，但她显然想从他们那里得到什么。她可以讲述以下关于这个岛的情况，至少她知道这些情况。",
	"The island has no name. The folk have lived here since the beginning of time. Outsiders sometimes come, but rarely stay, and the folk do not like them to.": "这个岛没有名字。民众自古以来就生活在这里。外来者有时会来，但很少停留，而且居民不喜欢他们来。",
	"The island survives primarily by fishing, growing beets, beans, cabbage and onions, husbanding a few goats and for a treat gathering wild raspberries and bitter walnuts. Sometimes, the sea provides thingsthat wash up on the shores of the island.": "该岛主要靠捕鱼，种植甜菜、豆子、卷心菜和洋葱，饲养几只山羊，并收集野生覆盆子和苦味核桃作为食物。有时，大海提供的东西会冲到岛上的海岸上。",
	"The fisher folk do not have an organized religion as the adventurers might understand it. Instead Elisande describes a collection of folk tales and superstitions, often concerning reptilian monsters from below the sea that both provide for the island folk when they are appeased and prey upon themwhen they are not. She does not believe that there is anything on the island beyond the landing, the village, and the woods. She has been told and believes the woods to be filled with monsters and does not venture far into it.": "渔民们没有冒险家们可能理解的有组织的宗教。相反，埃利桑德描述了一系列的民间故事和迷信，通常是关于来自海底的爬行动物，它们在被安抚时为岛上的居民提供食物，在不被安抚时则捕食他们。她不相信岛上除了登陆点、村庄和树林之外还有其他东西。她被告知并相信树林里充满了怪物，所以她没有冒险深入其中。",
	"She would like to be friends with the adventurers, playing up her lack of family on the island if the Outsiders seem softhearted. She can show them around or introduce them to others. As the day goes on, she asks more and more questions about the outside world and when the adventurers will be leaving, hinting that she might like to go with them when they leave.": "她愿意与冒险者成为朋友，如果外人看起来心软，她就会在岛上渲染自己没有家人。她可以带他们参观，或者把他们介绍给其他人。随着时间的推移，她会问越来越多关于外面世界的问题，以及冒险家们什么时候离开，暗示她可能想在他们离开时和他们一起走。",
	"If the adventurers rebuff Elisande, she begins shadowing them, following them from a few yards away. The villagers do not approve of the girl mixing with outsiders to begin with, so any threats or violence towards the girl will bring their wrath down upon them": "如果冒险者拒绝了埃利桑德，她就开始跟踪他们，从几码远的地方跟着他们。村民们一开始就不同意这个女孩和外人混在一起，所以任何对女孩的威胁或暴力都会让他们感到愤怒。",
	"The island is composed of a number of different locations to explore. With the exception of the Infernal Altar (which can only be found by exploring the woods), all of the locations are immediately obvious upon theadventurers arrival. Elisande points them out to the party as soon as they speak with her.": "该岛由许多不同的地点组成，供玩家探索。除了地狱祭坛（只有在森林中才能找到）外，所有的地点在冒险者到达后都是显而易见的。当冒险者与她交谈时，埃利桑德就会把它们指出来。",
	"After the general deception of each location, there is a subsection detailing what Elisande has to say about the location, what NPCs live there, and what might be found by searching the location.": "在每个地点的一般欺骗行为之后，有一个小节详细介绍了艾利桑德对该地点的看法，有哪些NPC住在那里，以及通过搜索该地点可能发现什么。",
	"There are thirty seven total villagers on the island, twelve of which are children. None of the fishermen are at sea today due to the fierce weather.": "岛上总共有37名村民，其中12名是儿童。由于恶劣的天气，今天没有一个渔民出海。",
	"It is in this slightly sheltered portion on the northwestern side of the island that the villagers land their boats, maintain their nets, and dock the ferry raft. The raft and several oar-powered or small single-masted fishing boats have been dragged several feet up shore and tied down. There is a shed here filled with mended nets, rope, and other gear for their trade.": "村民们就是在岛的西北侧这个稍有遮挡的部分将他们的船靠岸，维护他们的渔网，并将渡船筏子停靠。筏子和几艘以桨为动力的或小型的单桅渔船已经被拖到岸上几英尺，并被绑住。这里有一个棚子，里面装满了修补好的渔网、绳子和其他交易的工具。",

	"{@b Searching.} While there is nothing especially incriminating to be found at the landing, there is a wealth of supplies that might be useful in creating traps to defend the village: barrels of fish oil for lanterns, fish hooks, line, rope, and nets might be put to nefarious purposes if the players are so inclined.": "{@b Searching.}虽然在登陆点没有发现什么特别的罪证，但有大量的物资可能有助于制造陷阱来保卫村庄：如果玩家有这样的意愿，可以把用于照明的鱼油桶、鱼钩、线、绳子和网子用于邪恶的目的。",
	"{@b NPCs.} Until midday passes, Warsh is here with four other men, tying down the boats and preparing for the approaching storm. Warsh has nothing left to say to the adventurers unless directly approached, but the others point to the rising waves and say the monsters beneath the sea are angry.": "{@b NPCs.}直到中午过去，沃什和另外四个人在这里，把船绑起来，准备迎接即将到来的风暴。除非直接接触，否则沃什对冒险者没有什么可说的，但其他人指着上升的海浪说，海下的怪物正在发怒。",
	"To convince Warsh to aid the adventurers, see \"Rallying the Villagers\" below.": "要说服沃什帮助冒险者，请看下面的 \"召集村民\"。",
	"There are fourteen hovels that are or were home to small families of island fishermen scattered in a rough circle around the fire pit. The doors all face the fire pit and none have windows that face the sea. Four of the homes are no longer inhabited. Their roofs havecollapsed and they no longer have doors or shutters.": "有14间小屋是或曾经是岛上渔民小家庭的家，围绕着火坑散布在一个粗糙的圆圈里。门都是面向火坑的，没有一个窗户是面向大海的。其中四所房子不再有人居住了。它们的屋顶已经坍塌，不再有门或百叶窗。",

	"However, it is easy enough to pick through the three uninhabited hovels. Without any check it is clear that the hovels are made of logs and stone from the island along with a piecemeal of flotsam recovered from the sea: barrel staves, sail cloth, and broken oars. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) locates an odd fetish necklace in the remains of a rotted dresser. Five human teeth are braided into a long lock of brown human hair. Each tooth has symbol of five radial lines emanating from a central point. The fetish radiates both evil and fading magic from the conjuration school. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check suggests the fetish may have once protected the wearer from summoned creatures. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check reveals the markings on the fetish are related to the infernals of the Banehold, the Hells associated with a number of evil deities. Its power faded, the fetish no longer functions.": "然而，要在三座无人居住的小木屋中找到它是很容易的。不用检查就可以看出，这些小屋是由岛上的原木和石头以及从海里打捞上来的零星的浮土制成的：木桶杆、帆布和破船桨。在一个腐烂的梳妆台的残骸中，成功通过DC10情报（调查）找到了一条奇怪的恋物项链。五颗人类的牙齿被编入一绺长长的棕色人发。每颗牙齿都有从中心点发出的五条放射线的标志。这个癖好同时散发着邪恶和消逝的魔法，来自魔法学校。如果成功通过DC15智力（阿卡纳）检查，说明这个神物可能曾经保护过佩戴者免受召唤生物的伤害。如果成功通过DC20智力（宗教）检查，就会发现神物上的标记与Banehold的地狱有关，即与一些邪恶神灵有关的地狱。它的力量已经消退，这个神物不再起作用。",
	"{@b NPCs.} Each hovel has 1d4 adults within it and 1d6-1 children. They villagers do their best to ignore the adventurers unless specifically confronted or called forth by Warsh, Ulburto or one of the crones. In general none of them know of the villages past, but they keep the infernal faith alive, believing themselves to be worshiping the ancient creatures of the sea. The fisher folk will follow the will of their leaders, either siding with the adventurers or against them as appropriate.": "{@b NPCs.} 每间小屋有1d4个成年人和1d6-1个孩子。除非被沃什、乌尔布托或其中一个女巫特别面对或召唤，否则村民们会尽力无视冒险者的存在。一般来说，他们都不知道村庄的过去，但他们保持着地狱般的信仰，认为自己是在崇拜古老的海洋生物。渔民们会遵从他们领袖的意愿，要么站在冒险者一边，要么根据情况反对他们。",
	"This hovel has collapsed in upon itself, leaving only a small area where one wall leans against another that is protected from the rain. The villagers house the \"madman\" here. Empty food bowls and fish bones are scattered about, making it difficult to approach unheard. Any Dexterity (Stealth) check made to sneak up on Verik is made with disadvantage.": "这间小屋已经倒塌，只留下一小块地方，一面墙靠着另一面墙，可以避雨。村民们把 \"疯子 \"安置在这里。空的食物碗和鱼骨头散落一地，使人难以接近而不被发现。任何偷袭维利克的灵巧（隐身）检查都是不利的。",

	"If asked about the ship, he describes it as a great spectral galleon with the name \"Audacity\" painted on the bow. He added that last detail after seeing the name painted on flotsam in the barn, hoping it will bring the horror closer to home.": "如果被问及这艘船，他描述它是一艘巨大的幽灵大帆船，船头画着 \"Audacity \"的名字。他是在看到谷仓里的浮土上画着这个名字后才加上这最后一个细节的，希望这能让人更接近恐怖。",
	"Verik is a very good liar and spy, sent by Ixas to map out the village, search for likely stores of knowledge, spread fear, and disrupt the defense.

Another stick figure standing on the water is pouring a sack of what could be coins into the waves. Something about the place raises the hairs on the back of your neck. There is a wrongness here.": "在一个大房间的中央，有一块大致长方形的石块，石块中央滴着斑斑点点的锈色污渍。几根发黑的蜡烛被熔化在石头上，石块的中央摆放着一系列的仪式物品。墙壁上画着粗糙的艺术品，描绘着一条五头海蛇从海浪中升起，在岸边的棍子上大快朵颐。另一个站在水面上的棍子像正把一袋可能是硬币的东西倒入海浪中。这个地方的某些东西让你脖子上的汗毛都竖了起来。这里有一种错觉。",

It is rare for humanoids to worship her, but sometimes involves a sacrifice of wealth.": "在检查墙上的艺术品时，如果成功通过DC15智力（宗教）检查，就意味着这个生物实际上可能是提亚马特的变种，即邪恶的龙和贪婪的神。人类崇拜她是很罕见的，但有时会涉及到财富的牺牲。",

	"Also on the altar is a scroll sealed with a splotch of red wax. If opened, all the candles of the room flare to life. The scroll appears to be a contract between \"Servants of the Queene\" and the \"Folk.\" It details the deal struck sixty years ago in which the islanders traded their souls and a fortune in gold and gems in exchange for personal power and casting away the \"Outsides\"—unless the deal is broken. How the deal is broken is not specified, but it matters not, the adventurers have already broken it.": "祭坛上还有一个用红蜡斑点密封的卷轴。如果打开，房间里所有的蜡烛都会燃起来。该卷轴似乎是 \"女王的仆人 \"和 \"民间 \"之间的合同。它详细说明了六十年前达成的交易，其中岛民们用他们的灵魂和黄金、宝石等财富来换取个人权力和赶走 \"外来者\"--除非交易被破坏。如何打破交易并没有具体说明，但这并不重要，冒险家们已经打破了交易。",
	"A pile of books lie in the corner. Most are rotted with moisture and useless, but a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) finds a tome that is particularly old and appears to be written on some sort of leather.

	"{@b Palisade:} Wood is very valuable on the island, especially since many of the surviving trees produce nuts or fruit, so the villagers are very hesitant to build a walk, but the adventurers should be able to convince the villagers to use rubble from the abandoned or destroyed hovels to build a low wall in order to funnel most attackers. Building a stable wall requires a successful DC 15 Strength or Intelligence check to complete in one action (of the three each adventurer or group of adventurers have). Otherwise it takes two.": "{@b Palisade:}木材在岛上非常有价值，尤其是许多幸存的树木都能生产坚果或水果，所以村民们对建造步行街非常犹豫，但冒险家们应该能够说服村民用废弃或被摧毁的小屋的碎石建造一堵低矮的墙，以便将大多数攻击者漏掉。建造一堵稳定的墙需要成功地进行DC15力量或智力检查，在一个行动中完成（每个冒险者或冒险者小组有三个行动）。否则就需要两次。",
	"{@b Ditch:} Requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to detect. Digging ditches around the village is easy in the mud, and the rapidly fill with dirty water from the rain, making it easy to hide hooks, thorn bushes, or other dangerous debris inside them.

Hidden pits are difficult to make as they fill with water quickly, making it necessary to line them with spikes or other debris in order to do 3 ({@dice 1d6}) points of piercing damage. A successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw avoids the pit. Pits filled with oil can be set ablaze for 2 ({@dice 1d4}) points of fire damage each round.

Any adventurer that doesn't see a trip line must succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.": "{@b Trip Lines:}需要成功的DC 15智慧(感知)检查来检测。绊脚线可以被设置为绊倒敌人，使其俯卧。任何没有看到绊脚线的冒险者必须成功进行DC 10的灵巧救赎，否则就会倒地。",

Heavy objects that wing from a height at head or mid-level do 3 ({@dice 1d6}) points of bludgeoning damage and can be avoided by succeeding at DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Determine how high the weights are placed, small creatures (such as kobolds) will often be missed.": "{@b Swinging Weight Traps:}需要成功的DC 15智慧(感知)检查来检测。重物从头部或中层的高度飞来，会造成3({@dice 1d6})点的击打伤害，可以通过成功的DC15灵巧判定来避免。决定了重物放置的高度，小型生物（如哥布林）往往会被错过。",
	"It is quite possible that during their searches, the adventurers uncover mounting evidence that the villagers are not innocent victims that need protection.

	"If a conflict occurs out of sight of the rest of the village and the adventurers hide evidence of violence, they can avoid an all-out riot and they may proceed as normal. If not, several of the villagers rush to aid their fellows against the \"Outsides.\" This can quickly become a challenging fight if the adventurers are not prepared or working together.": "如果冲突发生在村子其他地方的视线之外，而且冒险者隐藏了暴力的证据，他们可以避免全面暴动，他们可以像正常人一样进行。如果不是这样，几个村民就会赶去帮助他们的同伴对付 \"外人\"。如果冒险者们没有准备好或者没有合作，这可能很快就会成为一场具有挑战性的战斗。",

All captives were to be brought in their longboats back to the ship for Ixas to interrogate with a magical statue that he has in quarters. The statue of the dracolich probes the mind of the victim, forcing them to answer all questions put to them, but it is a horrible process that damages the mind and steals one's sanity.": "如果被俘，哥布林和水手们很容易就会崩溃。他们欣然承认他们是听从神龙教崇拜者伊克萨斯的命令而来，后者就在岛的岸边等待他们的归来。他们要收集所有的书籍和潜在的魔法物品，并烧掉其余的。所有的俘虏都要用长船带回船上，让伊克萨斯用他在宿舍里的魔法雕像来审问。德拉科里奇的雕像会探测受害者的思想，迫使他们回答所有的问题，但这是一个可怕的过程，会损害人的思想，并偷走人的理智。",

The fog returns, billowing from the ship ahead. As you bring the longboat close in to the ship's ladder on the port side, screams of fear and pain emanate from the deck above.": "就在这时，你的长船呈现出红色，就像某种伟大的爬行动物的可怕的眼睛。一阵可怕的撕裂声传来，接着是一阵巨大的风和热的冲撞。愤怒的尖叫声爆发了。雾又回来了，从前面的船上飘来。当你把长船靠近左舷的船梯时，恐惧和痛苦的尖叫声从甲板上传来。",
	"The adventurers have just witnessed the arrival of the {@i Audacity} returning from the Nine Hells as the adventurers broke the pact between the Folk and Tiamat's followers (by either opening the scroll on the altar, taking wealth from the village, taking Elisande with them, killing the lemure or discovering the secret of the pact).

The ship, missing one of its two long boats, has the name {@i Audacity} lettered across the side. Both ships are on fire.": "当你登上梯子时，你看到一艘由骨头组成的发光的船，发出可怕的雾气，它的船头桅杆与你寻找的那艘船的前舱索具纠缠在一起。每艘船的船员都已经在互相战斗了。伪装成亡灵的哥布林和水手们与另一个船员作战--一群红皮肤的人类，打扮成海贼。这艘船的两只长船中少了一只，船舷上写着（%0%）的字样。两艘船都着火了。",

Using the dracolich statue in his quarters, an evil relic of the cult, he feasted on the memories and thoughts of all the captives from the coastal villages hoping to find some clue. The relic however drains itself every time it is used and does not function again until the next phase of the moon. When it is fully charged, a great storm gathers near it until it is used. Thus he used his resources and those of the old guard Cult to search for it, hoping to prevent the splinter faction from their goal.": "被俘的邪教徒，包括伊克萨斯，很容易崩溃，可以被迫说出他们的故事。神龙教中存在着分裂现象。伊克萨斯所属的一个团体试图忠于邪教的真正目的，即创建一个不死的龙族统治者阶层，而另一个团体则寻求受宠的（%0%），他们计划用它来篡夺邪教并将其引向一个新的方向。伊克萨斯一直在追寻谣言和占卜，说这个地区曾经有{@i Dragon Mask}，沿海小镇上有一本讲述它最后安息之地的巨著。他的主人给了他一艘可以发光和起雾的船，他编造了幽灵船的故事，希望能阻止当局和分裂派邪教徒的调查。他利用宿舍里的龙卷风雕像--邪教的邪恶遗物，大吃特吃沿海村庄所有被俘者的记忆和思想，希望能找到一些线索。然而，这个遗物每次使用时都会自我耗尽，直到下一个月相才会再次发挥作用。当它充满电时，它附近会聚集巨大的风暴，直到它被使用。因此，他利用自己的资源和守旧的邪教组织的资源来寻找它，希望能阻止分裂的派别达到他们的目的。",
