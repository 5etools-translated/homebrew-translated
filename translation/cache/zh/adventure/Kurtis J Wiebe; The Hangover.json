Not to be messed with they killed a few of the bandits and captured their chief before taking off in the wagon once more.

The horses have been devoured whole by the ogre about a mile away from the site of the opening scene.": "当马车被砸成碎片时，马匹就跑了。不幸的是，它们决定逃跑的方向是完全错误的。通过成功的DC12智慧（（%0%））检查，角色们发现了马的脚印，它通向食人魔最终攻击的方向（见下文场景1）。马匹已经被食人魔整个吞噬了，离开场的地方大约有一英里远。",
	"After being cut down as soon as Drake realizes that the characters don't recognize him he lies to tell them he is a simple family man.

Drake is a reasonably good liar requiring a successful DC 19 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to see through his story.": "德雷克被砍伤后，一旦发现人物不认识他，他就撒谎告诉他们他是一个普通的家庭主妇。他解释说，当角色们绑架他并把他扔进他们的马车时，他正沿着海岸路扎营。德雷克是个相当不错的骗子，需要成功地通过DC19智慧（（%0%））检查来看穿他的故事。",
	"If any of the characters challenge Drake's tale he simply makes up new stories about who he is: a travelling merchant who tried to rip the party off a farmer who tried to impress them with a story of family or fortune and so on.

	"The Halfmandinis insist on sticking with the characters until they have honored their agreement—except that he insists on now making changes to that agreement.

	"And while paying attention to the tiniest of details is often a wise choice on this day the morning of the Great Hangover you can't help but wonder if the ogre with two goblins in a backpack that suddenly crashes through the trees toward you is the punctuation at the end of the statement, \"I'm never drinking again.\"": "虽然关注最微小的细节往往是一个明智的选择，但在这一天，在大宿醉的早晨，你不禁要想，那个背着两个小妖精的食人魔，突然穿过树林向你撞来，是不是就是 \"我再也不喝酒了 \"这句话结尾的标点符号。",

They bob in and out with weapons flashing like it's some sort of stage play but they inflict no actual damage.": "{@creature ogre}认为自己是个战术天才，因为它为自己配备了火炮--站在它的背包里的两个{@creature goblin|mm|goblins}，用短弓进行攻击。拉里和其他半身人并没有参与战斗--尽管他们假装参与了战斗。他们晃晃悠悠地进进出出，武器闪闪发光，就像某种舞台剧一样，但他们没有造成实际的伤害。",
	"Drake attempts to flee if he is unbound.": "如果德雷克被解除束缚，他就会试图逃跑。",
	"If Drake is captured again after the ogre and the goblins are defeated he does what he can to convince the characters to return to the road. He promises a 10 gp reward if he is returned to his family.": "如果德雷克在打败食人魔和地精后再次被抓，他将尽力说服角色们回到路上。他承诺，如果他被送回他的家人身边，会有10GP的奖励。",
	"If Drake escapes during the fight he reappears in {@adventure Scene 2|TheHangover|0|Scene 2: Bandits on the Road!}.

	"Ahead through brush and bramble a group of rough-looking bandits appears along the forested road. They look determined. Possibly concerned. Definitely annoyed. In fact the variety of expressions on their faces suggests that someone has recently upset their lives with much a##holery. They talk among themselves and as you stalk quietly closer you can make out their frustrated conversation.": "穿过灌木丛和荆棘，前方的林间道路上出现了一群长相粗犷的匪徒。他们看起来很坚决。可能是担心。肯定是恼怒。事实上，他们脸上的各种表情表明，最近有人用大量的恶作剧扰乱了他们的生活。他们互相交谈，当你悄悄地走近时，你可以听出他们沮丧的谈话。",

If he escaped earlier he has rejoined his crew and enters the fray if this encounter becomes a battle fighting as a {@creature bandit captain} alongside his comrades.": "五个{@creature bandit|mm|bandits}的威胁几乎是微不足道的，即使有德雷克带领他们。如果他早些时候逃跑了，那么他已经重新加入了他的船员，如果这次遭遇战成为一场战斗，他将作为{@creature bandit captain}与他的战友们一起战斗。",
	"If Drake remains a captive of the characters the bandits offer 10 gp for the return of their leader when they see him revealing his true identity.

	"As you pass the road sign indicating that the outhouse of a town known as Frontier lies five miles ahead you spot a figure in the distance. Despite the vista of the sparkling ocean thrashing against the cliffs below you can't help but watch this stranger as you draw ever closer. In fact the closer you get the more familiar the figure becomes—in no small part due to the fact that you half-recognize the patchwork assemblage of women's clothing he's wearing.": "当你经过路标，指出前方5英里处有一个名为 \"前沿 \"的小镇的外屋时，你发现远处有一个人影。尽管有波光粼粼的大海在下面的悬崖上拍打，你还是忍不住看着这个陌生人，因为你越来越近了。事实上，你越走越近，这个身影变得越发熟悉--这在很大程度上是由于你半信半疑地认出了他身上那件拼凑起来的女式服装。",
	"The figure's arms are crossed, and he scowls as you draw close. \"Ah perfect. Couldn't leave well enough alone eh? Come back for a second round of good old Dick the Word Dirk eh? Let's just hope to the heavens that I don't repeat my mistakes from last night's word circle dirk. Double or nothing? And the question I have for you ladies is: Forward or backward?\"": "这个人物的双臂交叉着，当你靠近时，他皱着眉头。\"啊，太好了。你就不能不管闲事吗？回来参加第二轮好的老迪克的话德克，是吗？让我们对天发誓，希望我不会重蹈昨晚单词圈德克的覆辙。双倍还是没有？而我要问你们女士们的问题是。向前还是向后？\"",

	"Circle dirk is a word contest in which bets are laid on the ability of another person to correctly spell a challenge word forward or backward. If even a single letter is wrong the competitor loses. Despite having lost to the characters the previous night this time Dick is prepared having chosen words specifically for each of the girls.": "圈圈叉叉是一种文字竞赛，赌的是另一个人能否正确地向前或向后拼出一个挑战字。如果哪怕只有一个字母是错的，参赛者就会输。尽管前一天晚上输给了这些人物，但这次迪克已经做好了准备，专门为每个女孩选择了词语。",
	"Dick doesn't compete for the gold though. Rather his goal is to stump each of the girls with a word he associates with them—a prize worth more than any material gain especially after being thoroughly trounced the last go around. There is only one rule to the circle dirk (for both characters and players): No writing of any kind whether on paper or in the air. Success must come from the mind alone!": "不过，迪克并不争夺黄金。相反，他的目标是用一个他认为与她们有关的词来迷惑每个女孩--这比任何物质利益更有价值，尤其是在上次被彻底打败之后。圈子的规则只有一条（对人物和玩家）。无论是在纸上还是在空中，都不能有任何形式的书写。成功必须只来自于头脑！\"。",

	"Once the player has chosen forward or backward Dick reveals the appropriate word for that character. He pays 10 gp for each word spelled correctly.": "一旦玩家选择了向前或向后，迪克就会为该角色揭示相应的单词。每拼对一个词，他就支付10个金币。",

	"The magic item is worth its weight in gold but there's a problem. The knee-high statue of a person holding the {@i Gold Statue of Impossible Gravity} (which coincidentally is also a person holding a smaller version of the one holding him) can be moved only if one knows the command phrase. Larry knows that the command phrase is \"Good Luck Picking THAT Up\" (inflection on \"THAT\" is very important). But knowing how well the statue is protected, he plans to ensure that the girls are caught in the act while helping him and his team allowing the smidgens to extract the item while its guards are distracted.": "这个魔法物品价值连城，但有一个问题。只有在知道命令语的情况下，才能移动抱着{@i Gold Statue of Impossible Gravity}的人的膝盖高的雕像（巧合的是，这也是抱着他的人的缩小版）。拉里知道这个命令短语是 \"祝你好运，把那东西捡起来\"（\"那东西 \"的语气很重要）。但他知道雕像被保护得很好，他计划确保女孩们被抓个正着，同时帮助他和他的团队让smidgens在其守卫分心的情况下提取物品。",
	"No Strength check no matter how high can move the statue. If the surface it sits on is shattered the item simply falls down with full force to the next closest surface.": "无论多高的力量检查都不能移动这个雕像。如果它所在的表面被击碎，该物品就会以全部力量掉落到下一个最近的表面。",
