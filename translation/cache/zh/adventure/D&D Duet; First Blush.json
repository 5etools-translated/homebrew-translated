	"You wind your way down the familiar, but still slightly uncomfortable and close-walled, spiral staircase that opens onto a small hallway, the Teleportation Circle waiting at the far end. Between it and you stand two house guards and a locked iron door, the traditional security measures of the court. They nod at your approach and open the door. Beyond it you can see Master Elias fussing about the edge of a large circle of intricate lines and dimly glowing runes that pulsate in rhythm to his utterances.": "你沿着熟悉的、但仍有点不舒服的、封闭的螺旋式楼梯蜿蜒而下，通向一条小走廊，传送圈在远端等待着。在它和你之间，站着两个守卫和一扇上了锁的铁门，这是法院的传统安全措施。他们对你的到来点点头，然后打开了门。在门外，你可以看到埃利亚斯大师在一个大圆圈的边缘忙碌着，圆圈上有复杂的线条和暗淡发光的符文，随着他说话的节奏而跳动。",

	"Master Elias lifts his arms over his head, chanting in a throaty voice the final phrases of his incantation. A few arcane phrases into the spell, you watch as your amulet rises up in front of your face, slowly rotating in defiance of gravity. In the same moment that your teacher finishes the spell, a flash bursts from inside the amulet, followed by an unsettling scream before you feel the familiar full-body compression that comes with teleportation.": "伊莱亚斯大师将双臂举过头顶，用嘶哑的声音吟唱着他咒语的最后几句。咒语中的几个奥秘短语，你看着你的护身符在你面前升起，无视地心引力而慢慢旋转。在你的老师完成咒语的同一时刻，一道闪光从护身符内迸发出来，接着是一声令人不安的尖叫，然后你就感觉到了熟悉的全身压缩，这是由远程传输带来的。",

	"A howling wind greets your ears, and the shocking cold whips your eyes open, revealing the terrify ing reality that you are not at the Solstice Festival. Blinking through the bright snow as you turn around, you see an evergreen forest a half-mile plunge below. Squinting up, you find the imposing and unmistakable outline of Strahmin's Peak, the tallest mountain along the border. Lowering your eyes, the faint outline of fallen rocks beckons as a possible source of shelter from the icy mountain blasts. From the woods below, a haunting howl echoes against the rocky environs, urging you forward to temporary safety.": "一阵呼啸的风迎面扑来，令人震惊的寒冷让你睁开眼睛，揭示了一个可怕的现实：你不在至阴节上。当你转身时，透过明亮的雪地，你看到下面半英里处有一片常绿森林。眯着眼睛往上看，你发现了斯特拉明峰的气势和明确无误的轮廓，这是边境线上最高的山。垂下眼帘，倒下的岩石的微弱轮廓在向你招手，作为躲避冰冷的山峰的一个可能的来源。从下面的树林里传来了令人不安的嚎叫声，在岩石环境中回荡，催促你前进，以获得暂时的安全。",
	"The goal of this chapter is for the PC to put into practice everything they've learned thus far in a situation in which there are real stakes.": "这一章的目标是让PC在有真正利害关系的情况下将他们迄今为止学到的一切付诸实践。",
	"See the numbered dungeon map in Appendix B.": "见附录B中的编号地下城地图。",
	"As you approach the pile of rocks, you find, instead, the remains of an ancient edifice rising toward the mountaintop. Carved into the side of Strahmin's Peak, hidden from forest view by a craggy bluff, your eyes light upon a smooth stone entryway, ages of frost buildup integrating the construction into the mountain itself. As your eyes further adjust to the brightness, you perceive a sizeable stone column beneath the layers of snow to your right, the base of its fellow having caught your attention upon arrival. The bare, hand-carved planes of the fallen column, only lightly dusted with frost unlike the rest of your surroundings, indicate that it may have just recently fallen. The sudden sense that you have forgotten or missed something familiar, an intuition just out of reach, accompanies a subtle blush of warmth in the amulet against your chest. Intuitively, your arm reaches forward to brush the snow from the stone doorway.": "当你走近这堆岩石时，你发现的是一座古老建筑的遗迹，它正向山顶升起。雕刻在斯特拉明峰的一侧，被峭壁遮挡住，你的眼睛看到了一个光滑的石头入口，岁月的冰霜堆积将建筑融入山体本身。当你的眼睛进一步适应亮度时，你发现在你右边的雪层下有一个相当大的石柱，它的底座在你到达时引起了你的注意。这根倒下的石柱的光秃秃的手工雕刻的平面，与你周围的其他地方不同，只轻轻地沾上了霜，表明它可能是最近才倒下的。你突然感觉到你忘记了或错过了一些熟悉的东西，一种遥不可及的直觉，伴随着你胸前的护身符出现了微妙的暖意。凭直觉，你的手臂向前伸去拂去石门上的雪。",
	"{@b Runes.} The runes above the door are in an ancient language with roots in Elvish. A successful Intelligence ({@skill History}) check will allow the PC to understand that they essentially say, \"The Lonely Hold: Show the Sign and Enter.\"": "{@b Runes.}门上的符文是一种古老的语言，起源于精灵语。成功的智力检查将使个人了解到它们基本上是在说：\"孤独之地：出示标志并进入\"。",

The door will open and grant access to Area 1 if the PC shows their amulet.": "{@b Door.} 这扇门的表面有复杂的图案，并在中心处形成一个PC熟悉的形状。它与他们的护身符上的图案相匹配。如果玩家出示他们的护身符，这扇门就会打开并允许进入1区。",
	"{@b Columns.} If the PC investigates, they can tell that the left column crumbled and crashed into the ruins, smashing a hole through the roof. With a successful {@dc} 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) Check, they can climb over the icy boulders and hoist themselves up into a position where they could look inside to Area 1.": "{@b Columns.}如果PC调查，他们可以知道左边的柱子崩溃了，撞到了废墟上，在屋顶上砸出一个洞。如果成功通过{@dc}15的力量({@skill Athletics}) 检查，他们就可以爬过冰冷的巨石，把自己抬到一个可以看到里面1区的位置。",
	"The ceiling is about 20 ft high. Light penetrates the room via the opening in the ceiling.": "天花板大约有20英尺高。光线通过天花板上的开口渗透到房间里。",
	"You find yourself in a room ages old, abandoned long ago and protected by the foreboding peak. Tendrils of white from the piercing cold stretch across the smooth stone beneath your feet, and the wind gives a mournful howl as it whips into the room from the column's heavy cave-in from above. Intricate, faded frescoes adorn the walls of the room, providing a slight sense of warmth, tinged with melancholy, to the otherwise desolate chamber. A large marble desk sits further inside.": "你发现自己在一个古老的房间里，很久以前就被遗弃了，被不祥的山峰所保护。刺骨的寒风中，白色的卷轴在你脚下光滑的石头上延伸，风从柱子的重重洞穴中呼啸着进入房间，发出哀伤的嚎叫。复杂的、褪色的壁画装饰着房间的墙壁，给这个原本荒凉的房间带来了一丝温暖的感觉，并带有忧郁的色彩。一张大的大理石书桌就在里面。",
	"{@b Chasm.} In the center of the room, a large section of the floor has given way in line with the opening in the ceiling. It has created a gap of about 20ft. to the other side. A Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check will reveal the existence of Area 2, the floor of which is 60 ft. down.": "{@b Chasm.}在房间的中央，一大段地板与天花板上的开口一致，已经让位。它产生了一个大约20英尺的缺口，通往另一边。通过智慧（（1%））检查，可以发现2区的存在，其地板在60英尺以下。",
	"{@b Frescoes.} The frescoes around the room seem to depict an ancient and desperate battle between the forces of good and ill. Demons fight side-by-side with dragons against an increasingly dwindling and desperate group of celestials and heroes, struggling in vain against the overwhelming forces of their enemies.": "{@b Frescoes.} 房间周围的壁画似乎描绘了一场古老而绝望的善恶之争。恶魔与龙并肩作战，对抗越来越少、越来越绝望的天人和英雄，在敌人压倒性的力量面前徒劳地挣扎。",
	"{@b Desk.} Some ancient papers litter the desk. An Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals a hastily scribbled note reading in Elvish \"Burn, Give, and Receive.\" There is a small brazier on the desk that gives off a faint magical aura. There is a bit of ash and some dark brown in the brazier. If the PC burns a bit of blood in the brazier, the PC finds a hidden box containing a {@item Potion of Healing}, a {@item Potion of Cold Resistance}, and 1d10 {@item Gold (gp)|PHB|gp}.": "{@b Desk.}一些古老的文件散落在桌子上。通过智力检查（%1%），发现一张匆忙涂写的纸条，上面用精灵语写着 \"燃烧、给予和接受\"。桌子上有一个小火炉，散发着微弱的魔法气息。炉子里有一点灰和一些黑褐色的东西。如果PC在炉子里烧了一点血，就会发现一个隐藏的盒子，里面有一个（2%）、一个（3%）和1d10（4%）。",
	"{@b Trapped Stairwell.} A 5x5 ft. pressure plate trap will release poisoned darts in the narrow entry to the spiral stairs leading down to Area 2 unless the PC makes a successful {@dc} 13 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice the slight rise to the plate or the dart holes in the fresco. If triggered, the darts roll an attack {@hit +3}. On hit, the PC takes {@damage 1d4} poison damage and is {@condition Poisoned} for the next minute.": "{@b Trapped Stairwell.}一个5x5英尺的压板陷阱将在通往2区的螺旋楼梯的狭窄入口处释放有毒的飞镖，除非PC成功地进行{@dc}13智慧({@skill Perception})检查，注意到压板的轻微上升或壁画上的飞镖孔。如果被触发，飞镖会滚动攻击（%3%）。一旦命中，个人会受到{@damage 1d4}的毒药伤害，并且在接下来的一分钟内会有{@condition Poisoned}。",

	"You pause a moment or two as your senses adjust to the darkness of the lower room. Ahead, two imposing silhouettes from the fallen stone column distinguish themselves from the rubble created as they descended to their new resting place. Gazing beyond them to the far side of the long chamber, your gaze narrows to discern a door, carved in the likeness of a face. To the right, just beyond the former top of the column, a wide, deeply shadowed opening suggests a hallway.": "当你的感官适应了下层房间的黑暗时，你暂停了一两分钟。在前面，有两个从倒下的石柱中走出来的气势磅礴的人影，从他们下到新的安息之地时产生的瓦砾中脱颖而出。凝视着他们之外的长室的远处，你的目光缩小了，发现了一扇门，雕刻着一张脸的模样。在右边，就在以前的柱子顶上，一个宽大的、阴影很深的开口表明是一条走廊。",
	"{@b 1. Columns.} The massive pillars have brought down the ceiling but can be scrambled over without too much difficulty. On the other side in the corner is an {@creature Ice Mephit|FirstBlush} (MM. 215, stat block Appendix A) waiting in ambush. It will attack as soon as the PC clears the obstruction. A {@dc} 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check of the rubble around the columns reveals a skeletal hand upon which lies a {@item Ring of Protection}.": "{@b 1. Columns.}巨大的柱子把天花板压塌了，但可以不费吹灰之力就爬过去。另一边的角落里有一只{@creature Ice Mephit|FirstBlush}（MM.215，状态块附录A）在埋伏着。一旦PC清除了障碍物，它就会立即攻击。对柱子周围的碎石进行{@dc}10智力({@skill Investigation})检查，发现一只骷髅手，上面躺着一只{@item Ring of Protection}。",
	"{@b 2. Magical Door.} A magical talking door inhibits further ingress. The door is extremely gregarious and beside himself to have someone to talk to after all these years. Over the door are the words \"Open Says Me\" in Elvish. The PC must get the door to say the word \"Open\" to access Area 3. The door knows some things, but not how to open himself. Example responses to PC questions:": "{@b 2. Magical Door.} 一个神奇的会说话的门抑制了进一步的进入。这扇门非常好客，这么多年过去了，还能有人跟他说话，他很高兴。门上写着精灵语的 \"Open Says Me \"字样。PC必须让这扇门说出 \"打开 \"这个词，才能进入3区。这扇门知道一些事情，但不知道如何打开自己。对个人问题的答复示例。",

	"How do I get past you? \"My creators, given my friendly personality, decided it would be best if I wasn't too sure, seeing as how I'm a people pleaser and would be bound to reveal the secret.\"": "我怎样才能越过你？\"我的创造者，考虑到我友好的个性，决定最好让我不太确定，因为我是一个讨人喜欢的人，一定会泄露秘密。\"",

	"The forces of time have conspired to slay this innocent hallway. An Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check will net the PC a really cool-looking rock with some sparkles in it.": "时间的力量合谋杀死了这个无辜的走廊。通过智力检查（（%0%）），PC将得到一块看起来非常酷的石头，里面有一些闪光。",
	"This circular room is in complete darkness.": "这个圆形房间完全处于黑暗之中。",
	"Exclaiming in surprise,the door a slides to the side, revealing a short flight of stairs that lead down into utter darkness. The faint light reflecting off the collections of snow in the hallway behind you casts a faint shadow of the silhouettes of torches against the walls on either side of the stone passage leading deeper in.": "惊呼一声，门向旁边一滑，露出一小段楼梯，通向完全的黑暗。在你身后的走廊上，微弱的光线反射着雪的集合，在通往更深处的石头通道两侧的墙壁上投下了火把的轮廓的微弱阴影。",
	"After the PC acquires a light source, they can see the outline of a gigantic stone statue towering over a humanoid figure.": "在PC获得光源后，他们可以看到一个巨大的石像的轮廓，上面耸立着一个人形物体。",
	"The unsteady light cast by your torch struggles to force back and withstand the thick, physical darkness of this room. As your feet carry you further in, the fully-carved outline of a Frost Giant statue emerges from the far wall just behind it. The artisans carved it to loom menacingly over another icy statue, an equally detailed, though much smaller, human statue in the center of the room, its lower body obscured by ice or rock the sculptors had yet to carve away. As you approach, motes of light and fire from your torch break free, gliding quickly forward to the complex array of runes etched in the ground surrounding the statue of a trapped human male. The glyphs glow brighter as the circle becomes more complete, giving off a brief, low pulse as the last rune is lit. At this, the pillar of ice encapsulating the human statue from his waist down cracks, the sound resonating against the distant walls of the underground room. The echoes quieten, replaced by the lilt of running water as the ice melts away, the body slowly thawing, seeming almost to animate with the melting away of the icy prison. As you watch, the statue glances down at his diminishing bonds before moving his head slightly, turning toward you. Life gleams from confused but thoughtful eyes that fixate on your own.": "你的手电筒投下的不稳定的光，努力地逼退并抵御这个房间里厚重的物理黑暗。当你的脚步越走越远时，一尊完全雕刻好的冰霜巨人雕像的轮廓从它后面的远墙上浮现出来。工匠们把它雕刻得气势汹汹地笼罩在另一尊冰雕之上，这尊同样细致的人类雕像位于房间中央，虽然要小得多，但它的下半身却被雕塑家们尚未雕刻掉的冰块或岩石所遮挡。当你走近时，你的火把中的光和火的微尘挣脱出来，迅速向前滑行，来到被困的人类男性雕像周围的地面上刻着的复杂的符文阵列。随着圆圈越来越完整，石刻的光芒也越来越亮，当最后一个符文被点燃时，发出了短暂的低沉脉冲。这时，包裹着人类雕像的腰部以下的冰柱裂开了，声音在地下房间的远处墙壁上产生了共鸣。回声安静下来，取而代之的是冰块融化后的流水声，身体慢慢解冻，似乎随着冰牢的融化而几乎有了活力。在你的注视下，雕像低头看了看他不断减少的束缚，然后微微移动他的头，转向你。生命从困惑但深思熟虑的眼睛中闪现出来，凝视着你的眼睛。",
	"The statue is not a statue at all, but {@creature Garren Bronson (Paladin)|FirstBlush|Garren}, an imprisoned crystalline warrior from a past age. His stat block can be found in Appendix A.": "这个雕像根本就不是雕像，而是{@creature Garren Bronson (Paladin)|FirstBlush|Garren}，一个被囚禁的来自过去时代的晶体战士。他的状态块可以在附录A中找到。",
	"If Garren falls to 0 HP and is within 1000 ft of the PC's amulet, instead of falling unconscious, Garren is teleported into the amulet with 1 HP. The PC can release or contain Garren as an action. This is not immediately apparent to either party, but the connection can be hinted at, perhaps by mentioning that the amulet hums or feels warm.": "如果加伦的体力下降到0，并且在PC的护身符的1000英尺范围内，加伦不会昏迷，而是被传送到护身符中，有1体力。PC可以作为一个动作释放或控制加伦。这对双方来说都不是很明显，但可以暗示这种联系，也许可以提到护身符会发出嗡嗡声或感到温暖。",

	"{@b Flaw:} I overestimate my abilities from time to time.": "{@b Flaw:}我时常高估自己的能力。",
	"Garren was a mighty force for good in the ancient conflict,but was eventually captured, and imprisoned here for eternity.": "加伦在古代的冲突中是一股强大的正义力量，但最终被俘，并被永远囚禁在这里。",
	"Before the PC has time to ask too many questions of the deeply confused Garren, 2 {@creature Ice Mephit|FirstBlush|Ice Mephits} (MM. 215) attack. At the top of the next two rounds another {@creature Ice Mephit|FirstBlush} joins the fray. After 3 rounds, the Frost Giant statue animates and crushes any remaining Ice Mephits before pursuing the party. As it comes to life, Garren will prompt, bravely and clearly, \"Run!\" It is probable that the Frost Giant will squash Garren, sending him into the PC's amulet as they flee.": "在PC还没来得及向深感困惑的加伦问太多问题时，2个{@creature Ice Mephit|FirstBlush|Ice Mephits}(MM. 215)攻击。在接下来的两个回合中，又有一个{@creature Ice Mephit|FirstBlush}加入了战局。3轮过后，冰霜巨人雕像活了过来，在追击党派之前粉碎了任何剩余的冰雪梅菲特。当它活过来的时候，加伦会勇敢而清晰地提示：\"快跑！\" 冰霜巨人很可能会压死加伦，在他们逃跑时把他送进PC的护身符里。",
	"The Frost Giant is not given stats as it represents only a force to be escaped. Fighting is certain death. Run a skills challenge to have the PC make their way back through the dungeon. On 3 Successes they should be outside. For each failure, the Giant gets to try to hit the PC ({@hit +5} to hit, {@damage 1d4+1} Bludgeoning). Example rolls suggested on the table Check below.": "冰霜巨人没有被赋予属性，因为它只代表一种要被逃脱的力量。战斗是必死无疑的。进行一个技能挑战，让PC通过地牢的方式回来。在3次成功的情况下，他们应该在外面。每一次失败，巨人都会尝试攻击PC（（%0%）击中，（%1%）击打）。在下面的表格检查中建议了一些滚动的例子。",

	"With a mighty roar, the Frost Giant closes the distance between you with incredible speed, no longer encumbered by the confines of the ancient prison's ruins. In what could only be your last moments, you see the giant's massive axe sweep down as your amulet pulses against your chest. In the next instant, Garren is there before you, knocking you to the side, shield held high, incredibly deflecting the blow into the ground which rumbles with the ferocity of the attack. From beyond the giant's shoulder, you see a wide shelf of ice and snow fall from Strahmin's Peak. Avalanche!": "随着一声强大的咆哮，冰霜巨人以难以置信的速度拉近了你们之间的距离，不再受古代监狱废墟的束缚。在你最后的时刻，你看到巨人的巨斧扫下，你的护身符在你胸前跳动。在下一瞬间，加伦出现在你面前，把你打到一边，高举着盾牌，不可思议地把这一击打到地面上，地面上传来凶猛的攻击声。从巨人的肩膀之外，你看到一个宽大的冰雪架子从斯特拉明峰上落下。雪崩!",

Or perhaps they escape the giant, but now must survive to find their way back to civilization.": "随着冒险的结束，你作为DM有选择权。我在这里淡化为黑色，并理解为个人将被发现，并在山脚下的一个小村庄里醒来。也可能他们逃出了巨人的手掌心，但现在必须生存下去，找到回到文明社会的路。",
