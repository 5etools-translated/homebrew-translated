	"The purpose of this product is to make your life as DM easier. The following ten encounters, while linked by environment, are random. These encounters were purposefully not designed for a certain level range. Some encounters may require players to come up with solutions other than combat. The world is a scary place and sometimes you may have to run for your life.": "本产品的目的是使你作为DM的生活更轻松。下面的十个遭遇，虽然是由环境联系起来的，但却是随机的。这些遭遇是故意不为某一等级范围设计的。有些遭遇可能需要玩家想出战斗以外的解决办法。这个世界是一个可怕的地方，有时你可能不得不为自己的生命而奔跑。",
	"These modules can be used to craft a random encounter table for travel and exploration, to fill in the hexes of a sandbox, or whenever your players wander to a location for which you had not yet prepared.

	"Each Limitless Encounter will have a Further Adventure section to give the DM three ideas for additional quests that could spring from a seemingly random encounter. These hooks are merely suggestions for continuing a plot and should be used or ignored at your discretion. For example, if a hook suggests that the Duchess was the murderer, that is a just a possible twist you could build from and needn't be acted upon if it would disrupt your campaign.": "每个 \"无限制的遭遇 \"都会有一个 \"进一步的冒险 \"部分，为管理员提供三个关于额外任务的想法，这些任务可以从一个看似随机的遭遇中产生。这些钩子只是对延续情节的建议，使用或忽略都由你决定。例如，如果一个钩子建议公爵夫人是凶手，这只是一个可能的转折，你可以据此展开，如果会扰乱你的活动，就不需要采取行动。",
