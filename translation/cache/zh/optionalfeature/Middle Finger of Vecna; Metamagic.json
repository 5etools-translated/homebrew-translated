	"When you cast a spell, you can expend 2 sorcery points to delay its effect one to three turns. Before the spell is cast, you select the duration, the target, and roll any relevant attack rolls. Any effects on the spell's targets, including saving throws, are resolved when the spell triggers. If any conditions change between casting and effect of the spell that would make the spell impossible–such as the target leaving the spell's maximum range before the spell goes off–the spell fails.": "当你施展法术时，你可以消耗2点巫术点数来延迟其效果一至三回合。在施法之前，你要选择持续时间和目标，并滚动任何相关的攻击卷。任何对法术目标的影响，包括蓄力，都会在法术触发时解决。如果在施法和咒语生效之间有任何条件发生变化，导致咒语不可能完成--比如目标在咒语生效前离开了咒语的最大范围--那么咒语就会失败。",

Additionally, this spell ignores half cover and three-quarters cover.": "当你施展一个需要法术攻击卷的法术时，你可以消耗1个巫术点来瞄准一个自你上一回合以来已经离开你视线但仍在法术范围内的生物。此外，这个法术无视半遮蔽和四分之三遮蔽。",

	"When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend 3 sorcery points to cast a second, different spell at the same target. The second spell must also target only one creature and not have a range of self. You must expend the appropriate spell slot for both spells.": "当你施展一个只针对一个生物且没有自身范围的法术时，你可以花费3个巫术点数对同一目标施展第二个不同的法术。第二个法术也必须只针对一个生物，并且没有自身范围。你必须为这两个法术消耗相应的法术槽。",
	"When you cast a spell of 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th level, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to cast it using a spell slot one level lower than the spell's normal level, without changing the effects of the spell.": "当你施放一个2级、3级、4级或5级的法术时，你可以花费与该法术等级相等的巫术点数，使用比该法术正常等级低一级的法术槽施放该法术，而不改变该法术的效果。",

You must have an appropriate container in which to store it. The liquid is then considered a potion, which grants the drinker the benefits of your spell for the spell's normal duration. The spell is treated as if it was cast by you, but you do not need to concentrate on it if it would normally require concentration. The potion loses its potency when you take a long rest.": "当你施展范围为自身的非瞬时法术时，你可以花费与该法术等级相等的巫术点数（密咒为1个巫术点数），将该法术变成4盎司的可饮用液体。你必须有一个合适的容器来储存它。这些液体被认为是一种药水，它在咒语的正常持续时间内给予饮用者你的咒语的好处。该法术被视为由你施展的，但如果它通常需要集中注意力，你不需要集中注意力。当你长时间休息时，该药水会失去效力。",

	"When you are concentrating on a spell, you can use a bonus action on your turn and spend 2 sorcery point to change that spell to a different spell. The new spell must be of a lower level than the original, and is considered to be cast at the lowest possible level. If the original spell had a target, that target must still be valid for the new spell; for example, you cannot switch a spell you have cast on someone else to a spell with a range of Self. The new spell's duration is equal to whatever time remained of the old spell's duration or its standard duration, whichever is shorter. You cannot switch a spell more than once.": "当你专注于一个法术时，你可以在你的回合中使用一个额外的行动，并花费2个巫术点将该法术改为另一个法术。新的咒语必须比原咒语的等级低，并且被认为是在尽可能低的等级下施放的。如果原来的咒语有目标，该目标必须对新的咒语仍然有效；例如，你不能将你对别人施的咒语换成范围为自身的咒语。新咒语的持续时间等于旧咒语持续时间的剩余时间或其标准持续时间，以较短者为准。你不能多次转换一个法术。",
