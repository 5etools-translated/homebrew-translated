	"An individual wizard has the power to conjure an inferno with little more than the wave of a wand, but many know that the true path to shaping the universe is through cooperation with others.": "一个单独的巫师有能力在挥动魔杖的同时变出一个地狱，但许多人知道，塑造宇宙的真正途径是通过与他人合作。",
	"When a group of spellcasters works together to channel energy into a spell, they can bolster its power, or even gain additional effects. To qualify for group spellcasting, every spellcaster in the group must know the spell in question or have it prepared. Each member of the group expends a spell slot and begins casting the spell. The spell always gains two benefits:": "当一群施法者共同为一个法术输送能量时，他们可以增强其力量，甚至获得额外的效果。为了符合团体施法的条件，团体中的每个施法者都必须知道相关的法术或准备好它。团体中的每个成员都要消耗一个法术槽并开始施法。该法术总是获得两个好处。",
	"If the spell requires concentration, it continues as long as at least one member maintains that concentration, as long as no other members are concentrating on other spells, and all members remain within 60 feet of each other. Additionally, if a member loses concentration on the spell during its duration but the spell does not end, that member can regain concentration on the spell as a bonus action.": "如果该法术需要集中注意力，只要至少有一名成员保持该注意力，只要没有其他成员正在集中注意力于其他法术，并且所有成员保持在60英尺范围内，该法术就会持续。此外，如果一个成员在法术持续期间失去了对法术的注意力，但法术没有结束，该成员可以作为一个额外动作重新获得对法术的注意力。",
	"The spell's casting time divided evenly between each member of the group. In the above example with three clerics casting prayer of healing, the spell would take only 3 minutes 20 seconds, instead of 10 minutes.": "咒语的施法时间平均分配给团体中的每个成员。在上面的例子中，如果有三个牧师施展治疗祷文，那么这个法术只需要3分20秒，而不是10分钟。",
	"Additionally, the group can then decide to gain one of the following benefits:": "此外，该小组随后可以决定获得以下好处之一。",
	"The spell is cast one level higher than its base level for each member of the group beyond the first. For example, if three clerics each use a 2nd-level spell slot to cast prayer of healing, the spell is cast at 4th level (two levels higher) when the spell is completed.": "群体中每个成员的施法等级都比其基本等级高一级，超过第一个成员。例如，如果三个牧师各自使用一个2级法术槽来施放治疗祈祷，那么当法术完成时，该法术将以4级（高两级）施放。",
	"If the spell works over a certain range or creates an area of effect, one of these distances can be doubled for each member of the group beyond the first. For example, if seven wizards are casting locate object, the object can be sensed if it is within 64,000 feet (about 12 miles), instead of the normal 1,000-foot range.": "如果咒语在一定范围内起作用或形成一个效果区，那么这些距离中的一个可以为第一个以外的每个成员增加一倍。例如，如果有七个巫师在施展定位物体的魔法，那么如果物体在64000英尺（约12英里）范围内，而不是正常的1000英尺范围内，就可以被感应到。",
	"If the spell can be made permanent after being cast a certain number of times, as with the teleportation circle spell, each member of the group contributes one casting of the spell to the total. Thus, a group of five wizards could create a permanent teleportation circle is 73 days, instead of 365.": "如果咒语在被施放一定次数后可以变成永久性的，就像传送圈咒语一样，团体中的每个成员都为总数贡献一次施放咒语的机会。因此，一个由五个巫师组成的小组可以创造一个永久性的传送圈，时间是73天，而不是365天。",
	"The spell's duration is doubled for each member of the group beyond the first. For example, a group of four druids could increase the duration of a polymorph spell to 8 hours, instead of one.": "群体中每个成员的法术持续时间都会翻倍，超过第一个成员。例如，一个由四个德鲁伊组成的小组可以将一个多面体法术的持续时间增加到8小时，而不是1小时。",
	"Members of a group can also focus their energies on multiple of these benefits, allowing for even more versatility. For example, a group of 10 wizards who all know and have prepared the conjure minor elementals spell could have 5 members focus on increasing the spell's level (to 8th), while the other 5 focus on increasing its duration (to 16 hours). The spell would be cast in 6 seconds (1 round), and concentration would be maintained as long as at least one member always held concentration, and no members concentrated on other spells.": "一个小组的成员也可以将他们的能量集中在这些好处中的多个方面，从而允许更多的用途。例如，一个由10名知道并准备好召唤小元素法术的巫师组成的团体，可以让5名成员专注于提高法术的等级（到8级），而另外5名成员专注于提高法术的持续时间（到16小时）。该法术将在6秒内完成（1个回合），只要至少有一名成员始终保持注意力，并且没有成员专注于其他法术，就可以保持注意力。"
