	"An iconic item for Wizards, characteristic for Druids, and flavorful for many other spellcasters, characters are often excited and curious about having a personal staff. These rules serve as a baseline for custom staff creation, although it is entirely appropriate for any given world or narrative to have modifications.": "作为魔法师的标志性物品，德鲁伊的特征，以及许多其他施法者的风味，人物往往对拥有个人法杖感到兴奋和好奇。这些规则是自定义法杖创作的基线，尽管对于任何特定的世界或叙事来说，有修改是完全合适的。",
	"Creating a staff consists of three steps:": "创建一个工作人员包括三个步骤。",
	"1. Acquiring the physical staff": "1. 获得实体工作人员",
	"2. Enchanting the staff to be magical": "2. 给工作人员施展魔法的机会",
	"3. Imbuing the staff with spells": "3. 给法杖注入法术",
	"A magic-user's staff is typically a prized item, one with no small amount of personal connection to its owner. As such, crafting one's first staff is no small endeavor. The physical staff itself is typically acquired with a great deal of ardor, often by journeying to a significant location where the wood or other material can be carefully selected.": "一个魔法师的法杖通常是一件珍贵的物品，与它的主人有着不小的个人联系。因此，制作一个人的第一根法杖是不小的努力。物理法杖本身通常是以极大的热情获得的，通常是通过旅行到一个重要的地点，在那里可以精心挑选木材或其他材料。",
	"While there are no hard and fast requirements for what this process must entail, there is a typically a journey of some kind involved in the first step of staff creation. This quest should be of personal relevance to the spellcaster, and perhaps tied into other events in your campaign's story.": "虽然对这一过程必须包含的内容没有硬性要求，但在人员创建的第一步中，通常会涉及到某种旅程。这个任务应该与施法者个人有关，也许与你的活动故事中的其他事件有关。",
	"Once the physical staff has been acquired, the initial enchantment rite must be performed to transmute the staff into a vessel for containing spells. The Staff Creation Table shows information on creating staves of varying quality (rarity), including the maximum spell level able to be stored in them, and the number of charges they can hold. In order to craft a staff of a given quality, a character must have spell slots equal to the Maximum Spell Level for that staff.": "一旦获得实体法杖，就必须进行最初的附魔仪式，将法杖转化为容纳法术的容器。法杖制作表显示了制作不同品质（稀有度）的法杖的信息，包括其中能够储存的最大法术等级，以及它们能够容纳的费用数量。为了制作特定品质的法杖，角色必须拥有与该法杖的最大法术等级相同的法术槽。",
	"The enchantment rite must be performed in stages over several days, taking 1 hour each day to perform. It also requires the expenditure of a certain amount of diamond dust or, at the DM's discretion, another suitable catalyst of equal value. The value of the catalyst and the time to perform this rite are given in the Staff Creation Table. In addition, by expending an additional amount of the catalyst, the crafter can add a bonus to attack and damage rolls with the weapon (when used as a quarterstaff) or to spell attack rolls (or both, for double the expenditure) up to the number indicated in the Maximum Bonus column, which also indicates the necessary expenditure for such a bonus.": "施法仪式必须在几天内分阶段进行，每天需要1小时来完成。它还需要花费一定数量的钻石粉，或者由DM决定，花费另一种同等价值的合适催化剂。催化剂的价值和执行这个仪式的时间在法杖创造表中给出。此外，通过消耗额外数量的催化剂，制作者可以为武器的攻击和伤害卷（当作为四分法杖使用时）或法术攻击卷（或两者都是，消耗双倍）增加一个奖励，最高奖励栏中显示的数字，也显示了这种奖励的必要支出。",
	"When the rite is complete, the staff becomes magical, and can be used as a divine or arcane focus and wielded as a magic quarterstaff. A spellcaster attuned to the staff can also be imbue it with spells, and cast spells imbued within it.": "仪式完成后，法杖变得有魔力，可以作为神圣或奥术的焦点，并作为魔法四分法杖挥舞。与法杖相适应的施法者也可以给它注入法术，并在其中施放法术。",
	"To imbue a staff with a spell, a spellcaster must perform a ritual, spending 1 hour per spell level of the spell to be imbued. At the conclusion of each hour of the ritual, which typically occurs over several days, the spellcaster must touch the staff, cast the spell, and make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. With a successful check, the effects of the spell do not occur, but are rather stored within the staff. With a failed check, the spell is lost.": "为了给法杖灌输法术，施法者必须进行一个仪式，每一个要灌输的法术等级要花1小时。在仪式的每个小时结束时（通常会持续几天），施法者必须接触法杖，施放咒语，并进行智力（阿卡纳）检查，DC等于10+咒语的等级。如果检查成功，咒语的效果就不会发生，而是储存在法杖中。如果检查失败，咒语就会消失。",
	"At the conclusion of the ritual, the spell becomes imbued within the staff, and can be cast by any spellcaster attuned to the staff by expending charges equal to the spell level.": "仪式结束后，该法术会被灌输到法杖中，任何与法杖相适应的施法者都可以通过消耗与法术等级相当的费用来施展该法术。",
	"A staff may contain a total number of spell levels equal to three times the maximum spell level of the staff.": "一根法杖可包含的法术等级总数等于该法杖最大法术等级的三倍。",
	"At the DM's discretion, other rituals may be performed to imbue the staff with other properties appropriate to its quality, expending time and material components as needed.": "根据DM的决定，可以进行其他的仪式来赋予法杖与它的质量相适应的其他属性，根据需要花费时间和材料成分。",
	"Common": "普通",
	"Uncommon": "不常见",
	"Very Rare": "非常罕见",
	"Legendary": "传说中的"
