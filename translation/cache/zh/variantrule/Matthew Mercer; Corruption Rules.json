	"Certain landscapes house deeply evil places or artifacts that corrupt the very nature of people who spend time around them. Sites where the presence of such terrible wickedness can slowly twist and infect the physical forms of even the most holy of creatures. Unhallowed or cursed locations that erode the drive and will of those that linger. When sleep comes to those that stay, it's this period of vulnerability that invites the darkness in. This ruleset, heavily inspired by and condensing many elements of the {@link Heroes of Horror|https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes_of_Horror} Taint rules, allows you to have this dark influence slowly infect your adventuring party, helping build tension as they traverse the shadowed lands.": "某些风景区内有非常邪恶的地方或人工制品，它们会腐蚀在它们周围生活的人的本性。在这些地方，这种可怕的邪恶会慢慢地扭曲和感染即使是最神圣的生物的身体形态。不被允许的或被诅咒的地方会侵蚀那些逗留者的动力和意志。当睡眠降临到那些留下来的人身上时，正是这段脆弱的时期吸引了黑暗的到来。这套规则在很大程度上受到（%0%）污点规则的启发并浓缩了许多元素，允许你让这种黑暗的影响慢慢地感染你的冒险队伍，帮助他们在穿越阴影之地时建立紧张感。",
	"If a character completes a long rest near a source of strong, unholy evil or deeply corrupt magic, they must roll a Wisdom saving throw. The DC of the saving throw is outlined below, and is dependent on the character's current Corruption level and proximity to the source of evil. On a failure, the character suffers 1 point of Corruption.": "如果一个角色在强烈的、不神圣的邪恶之源或深度腐败的魔法附近完成了长时间的休息，他们必须掷出一个智慧储蓄。蓄力的DC在下面列出，它取决于角色当前的腐败程度和与邪恶之源的接近程度。如果失败，该角色将受到1点腐蚀之苦。",
	"When a new tier or corruption is achieved (Mild to Moderate, Moderate to Severe), roll a {@dice d8} on the Corruption Effects table below to determine the effect of that character's corruption. Corruption effects are cumulative with previous effects as higher tiers are achieved. Effects fade when enough corruption points have been cured to lower the character's tier of corruption (Moderate to Mild, Mild to None). If a character reaches 12 or more Corruption points, the DM decides whether or not the character dies instantly, or goes insane and becomes an NPC under their control. A character with 12 or more corruption points cannot be brought back to life or restored to player control until they are brought below 12 corruption points.": "当达到一个新的等级或腐败（轻度到中度，中度到重度）时，在下面的腐败效果表上掷一个（%0%）来决定该角色的腐败效果。腐败的影响与以前的影响是累积的，因为达到了更高的等级。当有足够的腐败点被治愈以降低该角色的腐败等级（中度到轻度，轻度到无）时，效果就会消失。如果一个角色的腐败点达到12点或更多，DM将决定该角色是立即死亡，还是发疯并成为他们控制下的一个NPC。腐败点数达到或超过12点的角色不能复活或恢复为玩家控制，直到他们的腐败点数低于12点。",
	"Corruption can only be cured naturally by resting away from any source of corruption, at a rate of 1 corruption point per week of rest. Otherwise, a {@spell Lesser Restoration} spell can cure 1 corruption point, and a {@spell Greater Restoration} spell can cure {@dice 1d4} corruption points.": "腐败只能通过远离任何腐败源头的休息来自然治愈，每休息一周可以治愈1个腐败点。否则，一个{@spell Lesser Restoration}的法术可以治愈1个腐败点，而一个{@spell Greater Restoration}的法术可以治愈{@dice 1d4}的腐败点。",
