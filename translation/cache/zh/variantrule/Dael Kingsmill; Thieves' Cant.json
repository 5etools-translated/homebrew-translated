	"STEPPING INTO A SMOKEY TAVERN AN ELF casts her eyes about to find the card game in the corner. Paying into the pot with the appropriate greeting, she waits to see what cards she's dealt by the man in the parallel brassard. They exchange amiable conversation for a time and when she's finished the elf stands, leaving the game and her winnings behind her.": "踏进一家烟熏火燎的酒馆，一个精灵四处张望，找到角落里的纸牌游戏。她向锅里付了钱，并打了适当的招呼，然后等着看那个戴着平行帽的人给她发什么牌。他们友好地交谈了一会儿，当她结束后，精灵站起来，把游戏和她的赢钱留在身后。",
	"A well-dressed dragonborn frowns, counting her funds for a third time. She has even less than she thought. She hadn't wanted to resort to this again so soon, but it seems she has little in the way of options. She stoops out of her rented room, calling to her companions that she'll be at the market all morning, clipping a double banded chocker around her neck as she does so.": "一个衣着光鲜的龙裔皱着眉头，第三次计算她的资金。她的钱比她想象的还要少。她本不想这么快就再次诉诸于此，但似乎她没有什么选择。她弯腰走出租来的房间，对她的同伴们说她整个上午都会在市场上，一边说一边在脖子上剪了一个双带锁子。",
	"A nimble halfling hand reaches out for an unattended purse only to feel a firm grasp landing on the matching halfling shoulder. A grinning half-orc with twin earrings greets them; \"it's been far too long!\" he laughs. Under the stranger's armpit, the halfling spies a patrol of city guards rounding the corner. \"Of course!\" their face lights up with recognition, \"How are the wife and kids?\"": "一只灵活的半身人的手伸向一个无人看管的钱包，却感觉到一只坚定的手落在相应的半身人肩上。一个戴着双耳环的半兽人咧嘴笑着迎接他们；\"真是太久没见了！\"他笑着说。在陌生人的腋下，半身人发现一队城市守卫的巡逻队正在转角处。\"当然！\"他们的脸因识别而亮了起来，\"妻子和孩子们怎么样了？\"",
	"Rather than form guilds, many rogues of varying trades have developed a common system of signifiers in order to make ease of their dealings in the public eye without drawing the attention of law enforcement. Some roguish operators will create syndicates, while others simply display their availability for hire for those aware of the cypher to make offers as they please.": "许多不同行业的流氓没有组成行会，而是开发了一个共同的符号系统，以便在公众面前轻松进行交易，而不引起执法部门的注意。一些流氓经营者会建立集团，而另一些则简单地显示他们可以被雇佣，让那些知道密码的人随意报价。",
	"A member of the Varied Trades may choose to identify themselves to others in the know by use of an accessory worn in two parallel bands, as plain or intricate as the rogue prefers. The location in which the accessory is worn also indicates the speciality of the individual displaying it.": "不同行业的成员可以选择通过使用一个佩戴在两条平行带子上的饰物来向其他知情者表明自己的身份，根据流氓的喜好，可以是普通的也可以是复杂的。饰物的佩戴位置也表明了佩戴者的特长。",

	"While it is common belief among the varied trades that spies operate in a similar manner to other rogues and understand the Cant, if one has ever been approached with the appropriate greeting, they have never revealed it by reciprocating confirmation of the craft.": "虽然在不同的行业中，人们普遍认为间谍的运作方式与其他流氓相似，并且了解坎特，但如果有人曾经以适当的问候方式接近过他们，他们从来没有通过对等的确认工艺来透露。",
	"A rogue seeking generally applicable knowledge upon arriving in a city should look for a deck of cards. Any signified individual actively using a deck of cards will respond to a greeting recognised as an appeal for information - so long as they're paid for their trouble.": "一个流氓在到达一个城市后寻求普遍适用的知识，应该寻找一副牌。任何积极使用纸牌的人都会对被认为是呼吁提供信息的问候作出回应--只要他们为自己的麻烦得到报酬。",
	"As a character with the Thieves' Cant feature pays into a playing card service, the varied trader dealing the cards will encode a message into each hand. Wherever or whomever they're discussing as the hand is dealt will be the topic to which the cards pertain. A rogue hunting down information can guide conversation to specific intel the dealer might be able to give, but should be subtle about it lest the dealer shut the game down. When the enquiring rogue has had their fill, they exit the game, leaving their contributions to the pot as compensation.": "当一个具有 \"盗贼之心 \"功能的角色向扑克牌服务付费时，发牌的商人会在每一手牌中编码一个信息。在发牌的时候，无论他们在哪里或者谁在讨论，都会成为牌的相关主题。猎取信息的流氓可以将谈话引向庄家可能提供的具体情报，但应该谨慎行事，以免庄家关闭游戏。当询问的流氓吃饱了，他们就会退出游戏，留下他们对彩池的贡献作为补偿。",
	"The key phrase greeting to win a rogue in the know a place at the information table is {@b {@i \"Nice to find a friendly face in an unfamiliar town\"}}, or statements to similar effect. Once welcomed to take part, the rogue will need to match the suits of the cards they are dealt in each hand with the seemingly innocuous topics of conversation floated by the dealer during that round. The meanings of the suits are as follows:": "赢得知情的流氓在信息桌上的位置的关键短语是{@b {@i \"Nice to find a friendly face in an unfamiliar town\"}}，或类似的声明。一旦被欢迎参加，流氓将需要把他们每手牌的花色与庄家在该轮中漂浮的看似无害的谈话话题相匹配。这些花色的含义如下。",
	"The location or individual mentioned provides a measure of safety for rogues practicing the varied trades.": "所提到的地点或个人为从事各种行业的流氓提供了一定的安全保障。",
	"The location or individual mentioned serves as a wealthy target for thievery one way or another.": "所提到的地点或个人以这样或那样的方式充当了盗窃的富裕目标。",
	"The location or individual mentioned is well protected or heavily guarded.": "所提到的地点或个人受到很好的保护或严密的防卫。",
	"The location or individual mentioned is a good bet for sourcing dishonest work.": "所提到的地点或个人是寻找不诚实工作的一个好赌注。",
	"These cards may be combined to form more detailed messages for the information seeker. For example a person may be described using three diamonds and two clubs to indicate that they're attended by personal guards but that things stolen from them fetch a good price.": "这些牌可以组合在一起，形成更详细的信息给信息搜寻者。例如，可以用三张方块和两张梅花来描述一个人，表示他们有专人看守，但从他们那里偷来的东西能卖个好价钱。",
	"While a tavern card game is a classic example of a context in which the party rogue might drum up information, it is worth considering other contexts in which a tradesmember could be utilising a deck of cards without drawing suspicion. When surrepticiously handing out intel through an interaction other than a card game, the DM should come up with appropriate equivalents to being dealt a hand of cards. For example, a charlatan fortune teller who is part of the trade might accept coin from a fellow rogue in the context of a tarot style reading, turning over appropriately suited cards at moments matching their wistful descriptions of decipherable landmarks and personalities of the city.": "虽然酒馆里的纸牌游戏是一个典型的例子，在这种情况下，党派流氓可能会收集信息，但值得考虑的是，在其他情况下，商人可以利用一副纸牌而不引起怀疑。当通过纸牌游戏以外的互动偷偷摸摸地发放情报时，DM应该想出适当的等同于发牌的方式。例如，作为交易的一部分，一个算命的骗子可以在塔罗牌式的解读中接受同伴的硬币，在符合他们对城市中可解读的地标和人物的俏皮描述的时候翻出适当的牌。",
	"Not every tavern or city will have a roguish individual willing to stand post and give up their time to others of the varied trades, but the bigger the city, the higher your chances of encountering someone looking to make some easy coin in this way.": "并非每个酒馆或城市都会有一个无赖的人愿意站在岗位上，把时间让给不同行业的人，但城市越大，你遇到想通过这种方式赚点钱的人的机会就越大。",
	"When a varied tradesman familiar with the cant is looking for work, they may display their availability for dishonest jobs by use of the parallel banded accessories. In this way, they advertise their capabilities to others who might have use for them, in the hopes of earning coin from such work during their down time.": "当熟悉坎特的各种商人在寻找工作时，他们可以通过使用平行带状配件来显示他们可以从事不诚实的工作。通过这种方式，他们向其他可能有用武之地的人宣传自己的能力，希望能在闲暇时间从这些工作中赚取钱财。",
	"Upon identifying a varied tradesperson who specialises in the desired field, an employer familiar with the cant will approach them with a coded greeting designed to feign friendship. The greeting serves two purposes.": "在确定了一个擅长所需领域的各种行业人员后，熟悉这些人的雇主会以编码问候的方式接近他们，以假装友好。这种问候有两个目的。",
	"The first is as confirmation of visual identification. If an employer's greeting is met with confusion by the stranger, they will know that the individual they've approached is not offering roguish work, simply making a fashion statement.": "首先是作为视觉识别的确认。如果雇主的问候遭到陌生人的疑惑，他们就会知道他们接触的人不是在提供无赖的工作，只是在发表时尚声明。",
	"Second is as a means of clarifying the type of exchange the approacher is initiating. The tone of the greeting phrase will differentiate between someone looking to hire and someone looking to blend in or for temporary protection in the form of hiding or a falsified alibi. On occasion, when a high alert for suspicious activity is in effect, a kind rogue will warn others of the varied trades to lay low by use of a similar greeting. For example:": "第二是作为一种手段，澄清接近者正在发起的交流类型。问候语的语气将区分寻找雇佣的人和寻找混入或以隐藏或伪造不在场证明的形式寻求临时保护的人。有时，当对可疑活动的高度警惕生效时，一个善良的流氓会用类似的问候语来警告其他不同行业的人低调行事。比如说。",
	"\"Look what the cat dragged in\"; \"Uh oh, here comes trouble\"; greetings suggesting a teasing closeness.": "\"看看这只猫拖来了什么\"；\"啊哦，麻烦来了\"；问候语暗示着一种挑逗性的亲近。",
	"\"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes\"; \"Boy, am I glad to see you\"; greetings expressing relief.": "\"你真让人眼前一亮\"；\"孩子，我很高兴见到你\"；表示宽慰的问候语。",
	"\"Long time no see\"; \"Feels like I haven't seen you in forever\"; greetings indicating a long period between meetings.": "\"好久不见\"；\"感觉好像很久没有见过你了\"；问候语表明相隔很长时间才见面。",
	"If a rogue requests and is provided sanctuary of any sort by use of the Strange Approach, it is generally regarded that repayment take the form of an owed favour. To demand coin in return for the service of protection is deemed poor taste, and work for such a tradesman would dry up in the city as word got around that they weren't good to work with. For the dishonest, reputation is everything.": "如果一个流氓要求并通过使用奇怪的方法获得任何形式的庇护，一般认为回报的形式是欠下的人情。要求用钱财来换取保护服务被认为是低级趣味，而且这样的商人的工作会在城市中枯竭，因为他们的消息传开了，他们不好合作。对于不诚实的人来说，声誉就是一切。",
	"Once a cant greeting has been accepted, an offer may be floated by the approaching employer, disguised as conversational catching up. This offer will provide the basic outline of the illegal work to be done, allowing those propositioned to decide whether or not they're interested in taking on the job. The type of task to be completed is already assumed based on the advertised speciality of the hiree, so ordinarily this conversation covers:": "一旦接受了一个亲切的问候，接近的雇主可能会提出一个提议，伪装成对话式的追问。这个提议将提供要做的非法工作的基本轮廓，让被提议者决定他们是否有兴趣接受这项工作。将要完成的任务类型已经根据招聘者的广告特长而被假定，所以通常这种谈话包括。",
	"Whether the contract is personal or on behalf of a syndicate;": "合同是个人的还是代表辛迪加的。",
	"The anticipated difficulty in carrying out the work;": "开展工作的预期难度。",
	"The amount of payment proposed; and": "拟议的付款金额；以及",
	"A location at which both parties may meet later for further details.": "双方稍后可能会面的地点，以进一步了解详情。",
	"When a greeting is accepted, it is customary for the hiree to enquire as to the employer's wellbeing. From there the employer is obliged to answer that they are either {@b {@i \"on my own these days\"}} if the job is for them personally, or {@b {@i \"starting a family\"}} or similar if the job is on behalf of a larger group. Some might wish to steer clear of crime family work, for example, or to remain unafiliated with a cause and this could be their only opportunity to turn down the offer of work without causing offense.": "在接受问候时，受雇者通常会询问雇主的健康状况。从此，雇主必须回答，如果工作是为他们个人，他们是{@b {@i \"on my own these days\"}}；如果工作是代表一个更大的团体，他们是{@b {@i \"starting a family\"}}或类似的。例如，有些人可能希望避免犯罪的家庭工作，或保持与某一事业的联系，这可能是他们拒绝工作邀请而不引起冒犯的唯一机会。",
	"The conversation will then move to the general foreseen difficulty of a contract. This will be measured by the health status of a fabricated loved one of the employer. The scale may range from a simple task when the loved one is {@b {@i \"well\"}} to a potentially deadly challenge if hey have {@b {@i \"passed away\"}}. If the obstacles are unknown, the health of the loved one will be similarly uncertain, {@b {@i \"a bit touch and go\"}}.": "然后谈话将转到合同的一般预见难度上。这将由雇主捏造的爱人的健康状况来衡量。规模可能从所爱的人是（%0%）}时的简单任务到如果他们有（%1%）}时的潜在致命挑战。如果障碍是未知的，所爱之人的健康状况也将同样不确定，（%2%）}。",
	"Payment is also usually discussed during this 'catch up', however the onus is on the hiree rogue to ensure such - if an inexperienced thief takes a job without negotiating remuneration and winds up with little reward to show for their efforts, the fault lies with them. Who are they gonna complain to, the guards?": "在这种 \"叙旧 \"过程中，通常也会讨论付款问题，但确保付款的责任在被雇用的流氓身上--如果一个没有经验的盗贼在没有商讨报酬的情况下接受了一项工作，最终没有得到什么回报，这就是他们的错。他们会向谁投诉呢，卫兵吗？",
	"A discussion of compensation may be brought to the conversation by the introduction of any topic enabling the inconspicuous use of numbers. By context a rogue should be able to glean whether the number indicates a multiplier of x100gp or x100pp, erring toward x100gp if in doubt. For example:": "关于补偿的讨论可以通过引入任何能够不显眼地使用数字的话题来进行。根据上下文，流氓应该能够知道这个数字是表示x100gp还是x100pp的乘数，如果有疑问的话，可以选择x100gp。比如说。",
	"x100gp/x100pp respectively.": "分别为x100gp/x100pp。",
	"Always x100gp.": "总是x100gp。",
	"Haggling for amounts is acceptable, but it is impolite to follow up with an uncertain attendance to the 'card game' for more details on the job; either accept the contract or turn it down.": "讨价还价是可以接受的，但后续不确定地出席 \"牌局 \"以了解工作的更多细节是不礼貌的；要么接受合同，要么拒绝合同。",
	"The location for further details will always be given as a card game at a particular address, commonly a safehouse, at a specified time.": "进一步细节的地点总是以牌局的形式给出，在特定的地址，通常是一个安全屋，在特定的时间。",
	"If the hiree is accepting the work offered, they should indicate their intent to attend the card game. If not, it is not uncommon practice to express uncertainty at one's ability to attend, reserving the option to pick up the job at the time of the card game, or formally accept or decline once more details have been learned. If taking this tactic, however, the hiree rogue should expect competitors to the contract to have been gathered in the mean time, likely lessening their potential earnings.": "如果受雇者接受所提供的工作，他们应该表明他们打算参加牌局。如果不是，表达对自己参加能力的不确定是很常见的做法，保留在牌局时接受工作的选择，或在了解更多细节后正式接受或拒绝。然而，如果采取这种策略，受雇的流氓应该期待合同的竞争者在这段时间内被聚集起来，可能会减少他们的潜在收入。",
	"As an optional extra, the informational card game may be described as a \"private game\" if the contract is being offered to this rogue alone, or a \"party\" if it is to be a team operation or a matter of first in best dressed.": "作为一个可选的额外内容，如果合同是单独提供给这个流氓的，那么信息牌游戏可以被描述为 \"私人游戏\"，如果是团队行动或最佳着装的第一件事，则是 \"聚会\"。",
	"Dorian is a rogue displaying his parallel bars while going about his business in the city. He wears two rings on the second and fourth fingers of his right hand, each of them a double band, one etched silver and the other plain.": "多里安是个流氓，在城市里做生意时展示他的平行杆。他在右手的第二和第四个手指上戴着两个戒指，每一个都是双环，一个是刻银的，另一个是普通的。",
	"Before too long he is approached by a bright-smiled elven woman with twinned bangles pushed up her wrist to make them hold their place": "没过多久，一个笑容灿烂的精灵女子走到他面前，她的手腕上戴着双环手镯，使它们保持在原位。",
	"\"Someone pinch me, I thought you'd never show your face in these parts again! It's so great to see you!\"": "\"谁来捏捏我，我以为你再也不会在这些地方露面了！\"。见到你真是太高兴了！\"",
	"Dorian has never met this woman before in his life. He beams and pulls her into a tight hug.": "多里安在他的生活中从未见过这个女人。他喜笑颜开，把她拉到一个紧紧的拥抱里。",
	"\"You too! I thought you'd moved out East, how are you?\"": "\"你也是! 我以为你已经搬到东部去了，你好吗？\"",
	"\"The family moved, I stayed here on my own. Doing pretty well for myself, actually.\" She shrugs in faux-faux-modesty.": "\"家人搬走了，我一个人留在这里。实际上，我自己做得很好。\" 她装模作样地耸耸肩。",
	"\"Glad to hear it.\" His smile tightens at her boastfulness even though it's all an act. Annoying is annoying. \"I should ask, how have things been with Theodora since I last saw you? Any improvement?\"": "\"很高兴听到这个消息。\" 他对她的夸夸其谈收紧了笑容，尽管那都是装出来的。恼人就是恼人。\"我应该问，自从我最后一次见到你，你和西奥多拉的事情怎么样了？有什么改善吗？\"",
	"She shifted, a notable loss of confidence. \"We lost Great Aunt Theo last year. But thankfully she got to spend a lot of time with all three kids and five grandkids before she passed.\"": "她摇了摇头，明显地失去了信心。\"我们去年失去了大姨妈西奥。但值得庆幸的是，她在去世前有很多时间与所有三个孩子和五个孙子相处。\"",
	"\"I'm so sorry. It's good she was surrounded by so many loved ones\"": "\"我很遗憾。好在她身边有这么多的亲人\"",
	"\"Hm. Yes. Well. C'est la vie!\" She perked up again and touched Dorian lightly on the arm. \"I've got to run, I'm meeting a friend, but we're planning a card game for a little after sundown - it's a cosy place on the corner of Market's Run and the West Alley; green door, planter box in the window, easy to spot. You should come!\"": "\"嗯，是的。好吧。C'est la vie！\" 她再次振作起来，轻轻碰了碰多里安的胳膊。\"我得走了，我要去见一个朋友，但我们计划在太阳下山后玩牌--那是一个舒适的地方，在市场之路和西巷的拐角处；绿色的门，窗户上的花盆，很容易发现。你应该来！\"",
	"Dorian winced thoughtfully. \"I'm really not sure if I can make it tonight, my companions will be expecting me...\"": "多里安若有所思地抽泣起来。\"我真的不确定今晚能不能来，我的同伴们都在等我......\"",
	"\"Oh come on! I could tell you about the fight Theodora's younger sisters got into at the funeral; it will be fun I promise.\"": "\"哦，来吧! 我可以告诉你西奥多拉的妹妹们在葬礼上打起来的事；我保证会很有趣。\"",
	"\"All five of them?\"": "\"他们五个人都是？\"",
	"The woman ground her teeth a little. Dorian smiled pleasantly.": "那个女人磨了一下牙。多里安愉快地笑了。",
	"\"Only three, but it's still a killer story. A nice, quiet, private game. For old time's sake?\" She looked him hard in the eye for a long moment.": "\"只有三个，但这仍然是一个杀手锏。一个漂亮的、安静的、私人的游戏。看在过去的份上？\" 她认真地看着他的眼睛，看了很久。",
	"\"Fine.\" Dorian nodded at the total stranger. \"For old time's sake.\"": "\"很好。\" 多里安对这个完全陌生的人点了点头。\"看在过去的份上。\"",
