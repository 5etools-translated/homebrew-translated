	"Occasionally, while on an adventure, one might find themselves a flying companion that they can ride into battle. Mighty dragon riders soar in the sky, battling their enemies on land and in the air. Majestic pegasus knights take their winged steeds into the air with them and battle evil that knows no bounds.": "偶尔，在冒险过程中，人们可能会发现自己有一个飞行伙伴，他们可以骑着它去战斗。强大的龙骑士在天空中翱翔，在陆地和空中与他们的敌人战斗。雄伟的飞马骑士带着他们有翅膀的骏马在空中与无边无际的邪恶战斗。",
	"There are many different ways in which someone might find themselves in aerial combat, and when they do there are certain rules that govern them.": "有许多不同的方式，有人可能会发现自己在空中作战，而当他们这样做时，有一定的规则来约束他们。",
	"When you are entering into an aerial battle, whether you are mounted or not, you rely on the single flying speed governing either yourself or your mount. When you are mounted, you likely cannot fly without your mount, therefore you have one movement between the two of you. However, this movement can be used on ither turn, or both turns if you have some movement speed left between turns.": "当你进入空战时，无论你是否有坐骑，你都要依靠自己或坐骑的单一飞行速度。当你骑马时，你很可能在没有坐骑的情况下无法飞行，因此你在你们两个人之间有一个动作。然而，这个动作可以在另一个回合使用，或者两个回合都使用，如果你在两个回合之间还有一些移动速度。",
	"Aerial combat is a dangerous game of strategy and timing. One cannot attack a creature that is not within their range, so often it is beneficial, if not absolutely required for your mount to grapple with a creature to land any attacks (different rules apply for pegasuses, located at the end of this ruleset). The only exception to this rule is bows and ranged weapons, though using a ranged weapon in aerial combat always takes disadvantage unless guided by magic. However, when you are in a mid-air grapple you are unable to make any movement and will then fall from the sky. You must choose carefully the timing in which you grapple and attack a creature.": "空中战斗是一个危险的策略和时机的游戏。人们无法攻击不在其范围内的生物，因此通常情况下，即使不是绝对需要，你的坐骑也要抓住一个生物来进行任何攻击（不同的规则适用于小马，位于本规则集的最后）。这条规则的唯一例外是弓和远程武器，尽管在空战中使用远程武器总是处于劣势，除非有魔法引导。然而，当你处于半空抓取状态时，你无法进行任何移动，然后将从空中坠落。你必须仔细选择你抓取和攻击生物的时机。",
	"Because of the restrictions of aerial combat and the need to grapple your target, altitude is almost always an advantage. When a creature is above another creature, they take advantage on grapple checks and saving throws against another creature. And a creature that is of a lower altitude takes disadvantage on all grapple checks and saving throws. Because of this, aerial combat is a dangerous game of strategy and precision. Because aerial combat often takes a long time, the two sides often attempt to ground their targets in any way possible, most often by atacking the opponent's wings.": "由于空战的限制和抓取目标的需要，高度几乎总是一种优势。当一个生物在另一个生物的上方时，他们在对另一个生物进行抓捕检查和蓄力投掷时具有优势。而处于较低高度的生物在所有抓捕检查和蓄力动作上都处于劣势。正因为如此，空战是一个危险的策略和精确的游戏。因为空战往往需要很长的时间，所以双方往往试图以任何可能的方式使他们的目标接地，最常见的是攻击对方的翅膀。",
	"While you are in the air, you are not only in a fight with your combatants, but also with the forces of nature themselves. Gravity pulls on you as you fight in the air, and if you aren't careful you may come a little too close to the ground.": "当你在空中时，你不仅是在与你的战斗人员战斗，而且是在与自然力量本身战斗。当你在空中战斗时，重力会拉扯你，如果你不小心，你可能会离地面太近。",
	"A creature such as a dragon or pegasus, those that are typically ridden in aerial combat, are accustomed to flying, and can hold themselves up by their wings and the magics that allow such creatures to fly. During combat, a creature can use its move action to climb higher into the sky, or to reposition itself on the battlefield. If you are grappled in mid-air, as is necessary for aerial combat, you fall at a rate of 60 feet per round.": "像龙或飞马这样的生物，那些通常在空战中被骑着的生物，习惯于飞行，并且可以通过它们的翅膀和让这种生物飞行的魔法来支撑自己。在战斗中，生物可以使用它的移动动作爬到更高的天空，或者在战场上重新定位。如果你在半空中被抓住，就像空战所需要的那样，你会以每回合60英尺的速度下降。",
	"Following are the rules of combat that I have designed for aerial mounts. Much of the rules of combat remain consistent in the air, however there are a few points that should be highlighted to help when engaging in aerial combat.": "以下是我为空中坐骑设计的战斗规则。大部分的战斗规则在空中保持一致，然而有几点应该强调，以帮助参与空中战斗时。",
	"When you are engaged in aerial combat, the rules of grappling apply the same way as they do on the ground.": "当你进行空战时，擒拿规则的适用方式与地面上的相同。",
	"When you are grappling with a target, you fall at a speed of 60 feet per round. (I am ignoring the science of free-fall for the sake of balance and storytelling, if you would like to add more realism to your games feel free to adjust accordingly).": "当你抓紧目标时，你以每回合60英尺的速度下落。(为了平衡和讲故事，我忽略了自由落体的科学性，如果你想在你的游戏中增加更多的真实性，请自由调整）。",
	"When you are riding a mount or flying, you can expend your movement to maneuver yourself on the battlefield, and oftentimes it is beneficial to take the dash action to gain an altitudinal advantage over your enemeis.": "当你骑着坐骑或飞行时，你可以消耗你的移动力在战场上操纵自己，很多时候，采取冲刺动作来获得对敌人的高度优势是有益的。",
	"When you are engaged in aerial combat, it is important for you to keep track of your altitude in addition to location on the battlefield. The easiest way to do this is to use tokens on a game mat with a meter measuring altitude, but this can be tailored by the DM to best fit your group.": "当你参与空战时，除了在战场上的位置外，跟踪你的海拔高度也很重要。最简单的方法是在游戏垫子上使用代币，用一个测量高度的仪表，但这可以由管理员定制，以最适合你的小组。",
	"Fall damage, as quoted from page 183 of the Player's Handbook.": "坠落伤害，引自《玩家手册》第183页。",
	"At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.": "在坠落结束时，生物每坠落10英尺就会受到1d6的重击伤害，最大为20d6。该生物俯卧着地，除非它能避免受到坠落的伤害。",
	"Typically, a creature will disengage from combat and return to the group long before it becomes incapacitated. Typically a creature will be considered beaten when it reaches 20% of its hit point maximum, and at this point the creature will attempt to return to the ground so that it doesn't fall to its death.": "通常情况下，一个生物会在它失去能力之前很长时间脱离战斗并回到群体中。通常情况下，当一个生物达到其最大命中率的20%时，就会被认为是被打败了，在这一点上，该生物会试图回到地面上，以便不至于摔死。",
	"Out of self-preservation, a mount will typically return to the ground when it reaches the 20% mark, unless its rider doesn't allow it to reach the ground, make it clear to the players what is happening and the ramifications if they do not attempt to land safely.": "出于自我保护，坐骑通常会在到达20%的标记时返回地面，除非它的骑手不允许它到达地面，让玩家清楚地知道发生了什么，以及如果他们不尝试安全降落的后果。",
	"If a creature is grappled, then it very likely could become killed outright without being able to make this attempt. However, when a creature is incapacitated, they do not fall any faster than the 60 feet per round, so their rider may make attempts to stabilize their mount so that they can safely reach the ground.": "如果一个生物被抓住了，那么它很有可能在无法进行这种尝试的情况下被直接杀死。然而，当一个生物失去能力时，它们的下落速度不会超过每回合60英尺，所以它们的骑手可以尝试稳定它们的坐骑，以便它们能够安全地到达地面。"
