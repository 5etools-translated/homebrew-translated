	"As you may have collected, not everyone is a fan of poison as it stands in Dungeons and Dragons right now. Some think it underwhelming and others may be unimpressed with the way it's handled in general. This guide should hopefully give you a new angle on poisons and a way to enjoy them once again!": "正如你可能已经收集到的，并不是每个人都喜欢龙与地下城中的毒药，因为它现在是这样。有些人认为它不太受欢迎，有些人可能对它的处理方式不以为然。本指南希望能给你一个关于毒药的新角度，并让你再次享受到毒药的乐趣。",
	"The purpose of these pages is to breath some new life into poison crafting by implementing a light-weight, customizable system for you to use. The best part about it is that the same rules can be applied to normal potions, but for the purposes of brevity, we're going to be focusing on the poison aspects of it for the time being.": "这些页面的目的是通过实施一个轻量级的、可定制的系统来为毒药制作注入一些新的活力，供你使用。它最好的部分是，同样的规则可以应用于普通药水，但为了简洁起见，我们将暂时把重点放在毒药方面。",
	"Poison crafting under this system has just 2 main steps. Acquiring the ingredients and putting them together, no different then the normal rules, right? Well, a majority of what makes this system unique is what falls under the putting them together part. Under this system there are 3 ingredients required to make a properly potent poison. A base, the poison itself, and the bolstering agent.": "在这个系统下制作毒药只有两个主要步骤。获得原料和把它们放在一起，与普通的规则没有区别，对吗？好吧，这个系统的独特之处大部分是属于把它们放在一起的部分。在这个系统下，有3种成分需要用来制作一个适当的强效毒药。一种基质，毒药本身，以及增强剂。",
	"Let's go into greater detail concerning the ingredients.": "让我们更详细地了解一下有关成分的情况。",
	"Simply put, a base can be anything that holds the other ingredients.": "简单地说，底座可以是容纳其他成分的任何东西。",
	"Each Base ingredient carries with it a {@b Detection DC}, this represents how difficult the poison is to detect when mixed in with other things, such as food or drink. Some poisons have a very low detection DC, as they're not meant to be delivered stealthily, others have a very high DC, making them perfect for subtle operations.": "每种基本成分都有一个{@b Detection DC}，这代表了这种毒药与其他东西混合时的检测难度，比如食物或饮料。有些毒药的侦测难度很低，因为它们不是为了隐蔽地投放，其他的毒药则有很高的侦测难度，使它们非常适合于微妙的行动。",
	"Like most of the ingredients that you'll read about later, some bases can only hold their form when mixed with the right ingredients. This means that for a powder base to hold it's \"powderiness\", it needs to be mixed with other powders, or else the poison becomes a paste, which while not inherently a bad thing, may not be what you're looking for. More on this later.": "就像你稍后要读到的大多数成分一样，一些基质只有在与正确的成分混合时才能保持其形态。这意味着，为了使粉末状基底保持其 \"粉性\"，它需要与其他粉末混合，否则毒药会变成糊状，虽然这本身不是一件坏事，但可能不是你正在寻找的东西。稍后会有更多这方面的内容。",
	"Furthermore, the cheaper the base, the larger the potency debuff it accrues on the final product. Conversely, the more expensive the base, the greater the potency buff.": "此外，基质越便宜，它在最终产品上累积的效力削弱就越大。反之，基质越贵，效力BUFF就越大。",
	"No poison is complete without the, well, poison.": "没有毒药就没有完整的，嗯，毒药。",
	"Like the base, poisons come in a variety of different forms, each needing to be matched with a similar form to maintain the original. This ingredient applies the Poisoned condition and decides the Save DC that must be passed in order to not only stave off the poisoned condition, but also the effects of the bolstering agent. It also dictates the duration that the creature will be poisoned for.": "和基础一样，毒药也有各种不同的形式，每一种都需要与类似的形式相匹配，以保持原有的效果。这种成分适用于中毒条件，并决定必须通过的救赎DC，以便不仅能避免中毒条件，而且能避免增强剂的效果。它还决定了生物将被毒害的持续时间。",
	"Some poisons grant a higher DC, but a shorter duration, others grant a lower DC, but a longer duration. There are poisons that grant higher numbers for both, but these are greatly expensive.": "有些毒药给予较高的DC，但持续时间较短；有些毒药给予较低的DC，但持续时间较长。也有一些毒药在这两方面都给予较高的数字，但这些都是非常昂贵的。",
	"The Bolstering Agent works to grant the poison it's secondary effects": "强化剂的作用是赋予毒药它的次要效果",
	"The effects granted by the bolster could be as simple as dealing damage over the duration or a large spike of damage at the beginning to opening cuts all over the subjects body or freezing extremities. Each bolster has 3 possible effects, each broken up into 3 roll ranges. The lower range produces a weaker effect, the middle range produce the standard effect and the high range goes above and beyond, elevating the poison to a much more powerful tier.": "长枕的效果可以简单到在持续时间内造成伤害，或在开始时造成巨大的伤害峰值，或在受试者全身开刀或冻结四肢。每个长枕有3种可能的效果，每一种都被分成3个滚动范围。较低的范围产生较弱的效果，中间的范围产生标准的效果，而高的范围则超越了这个范围，将毒药提升到一个更强大的层次。",
	"As stated before, all ingredients come as a pre-existing form. This can be either a powder or a liquid. In order for a poison to remain in one of these two states, one must make sure that the form of the base matches the form of the poison.": "如前所述，所有成分都以预先存在的形式出现。这可以是粉末或液体。为了使毒药保持这两种状态之一，必须确保基地的形式与毒药的形式相符。",
	"This can all be circumvented with the proper preparation, however. If one has {@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|Alchemists Tools}, they would be able to convert the ingredient's type, taking an amount of time correlating to it's gold value.": "然而，这一切都可以通过适当的准备来规避。如果一个人有{@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|Alchemists Tools}，他们将能够转换成分的类型，花费的时间与它的黄金价值相关。",

For all rolls, make a flat {@b intelligence check} to determine the result, adding proficiency if proficient with {@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|alchemists supplies}.": "现在你已经获得了所有3种成分，是时候把它们带到一个合适的炼金站了。这可以像{@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|alchemists supplies}那样轻，也可以像城堡里的炼金实验室那样重，你只是需要一个地方来把这些东西放在一起。对于所有的卷轴，做一个平坦的{@b intelligence check}来决定结果，如果精通{@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|alchemists supplies}，就加上熟练度。",

	"When you've lined up all your ingredients, you can choose to make one {@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|Alchemists Supplies} roll, using the same value for all 3 ingredients tables": "当你把所有的材料排好后，你可以选择做一个{@item Alchemist's Supplies|PHB|Alchemists Supplies}卷，用相同的值来做所有3个材料表",
	"Normally, poisons reveal their duration once used on a target, but during this crafting process, you can now choose to activate a poison, meaning that rather than rolling for duration when you use it, you'd roll it during the creation process. You'd then use whatever number you rolled during creation after you use the poison.": "通常情况下，毒药一旦用于目标就会显示其持续时间，但在这个制作过程中，你现在可以选择激活毒药，这意味着你不是在使用它时滚动持续时间，而是在创造过程中滚动它。在你使用毒药后，你将使用你在创造过程中掷出的任何数字。",

	"He's got all his ingredients together and has them laid out on his alchemist's table.": "他把所有的材料都放在一起，并把它们摆在他的炼金术士的桌子上。",
	"First, he'll have to roll on the base table. He rolls a 14 for his base of water. Nothing of note takes place, but he makes note of the -3 that the base gives later potency rolls.": "首先，他要在基础表上滚动。他为他的水基数掷出了14分。没有什么值得注意的事情发生，但他记下了这个基数给后来的药效卷带来的-3。",
	"Next, he'll roll on the poison table to produce the effects of the Wolf Spider Venom, his second ingredient. He rolls a 12, and then adds on the -3 debuff that water gave. This totals to a final roll of 9, which means that his poison will now suffer a 1d4 subtraction from it's total effective time (in minutes). So, when it's rolled to see how long the poison stays in effect for, 1d3 will be subtracted off the result.": "接下来，他将在毒药表上滚动，产生狼蛛毒液的效果，这是他的第二种成分。他掷出12分，然后再加上水给的-3减伤。这意味着他的毒药现在将从它的总有效时间（分钟）中减去1d4。因此，当它被掷出以查看毒药的有效时间时，1d3将被从结果中减去。",
	"Finally, he'll need to roll for the bolstering table. He shelled out the cash to get his hands on some Green Dragon's Breath and threw it in, rolling a 15. Not bad. This means that every round, on the victim's turn, they'll take {@damage 1d8} poison damage for the duration of the poison.": "最后，他需要为强化表滚动。他掏出钱来买了一些绿色的龙息，然后把它扔了进去，滚了一个15。还不错。这意味着每一轮，在受害者的回合中，他们将在毒药的持续时间内受到{@damage 1d8}的毒药伤害。",
	"At the very end of it, he's going to choose to activate the poison. He rolls a 2 minute duration, rolls and subtracts the 1d3 potency reduction for a final duration of 1 minute.": "在它的最后，他要选择激活毒药。他掷出2分钟的持续时间，掷出并减去1d3的效力减免，最后的持续时间为1分钟。",
