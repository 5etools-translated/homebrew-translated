	"Known only to Druids and their ancestors, the Druidic language serves as a way of communicating short but important messages about surrounding areas. Often marked onto various natural materials via druidcraft, Druidic functions as a language by using symbols to convey things like directions, warnings and advice to all who are able to decipher it.": "只有德鲁伊和他们的祖先知道，德鲁伊语言是一种传达有关周围地区简短但重要信息的方式。德鲁伊语言经常通过德鲁伊工艺标记在各种自然材料上，通过使用符号向所有能够破译它的人传达方向、警告和建议等信息。",
	"Within the language, there are 45 symbols representing different ideas or places that are relevant to all who wander through the wilds — and with them, short simple phrases are able to be crafted.": "在这种语言中，有45个符号代表不同的想法或地点，与所有在荒野中漫步的人有关--有了它们，就能编制出简单的短语。",
	"For example, marking the symbol for [Camp] would mean that there is a camp nearby. In addition, you can use one of the symbols to represent one of the 8 cardinal directions coupled with the symbol for [Far] or [Close] in order to give a more accurate location. Lastly, using modifiers, you can add to this message by including the symbols for [Orc] and [Danger] — which, when put together, will create a message that reads \"Danger, close by in [x] direction there is an orc cave\"": "例如，标记[营地]的符号就意味着附近有一个营地。此外，你可以用其中一个符号代表8个方向中的一个，再加上[远]或[近]的符号，以便提供一个更准确的位置。最后，使用修饰符，你可以通过包括[兽人]和[危险]的符号来增加这个信息--当它们组合在一起时，将创建一个信息：\"危险，在[x]方向附近有一个兽人洞穴\"",
	"Druidic has a very simple but crucial grammatical structure.": "德鲁伊德语有一个非常简单但关键的语法结构。",
	"(which in the previous example would be [Camp]) acts as the \"subject\" of the message, and is to be in the center position of the marking.": "(在前面的例子中是[Camp]）作为信息的 \"主题\"，并且要在标记的中心位置。",

	"act as ways to alter or inform the Primary Message, and are placed to the right. Important to note: Modifiers should be made smaller than the Primary Message to avoid confusion. Usually, three modifiers will suffice for a message but, on occasion, less-traditional druids have been known to use more. ": "作为改变或告知主要信息的方式，被放在右边。需要注意的是：修饰语应该比主要信息小，以避免混淆。通常情况下，一条信息有三个修饰语就足够了，但有时不那么传统的德鲁伊也会使用更多。",
	"It's important to note that, throughout tradition, messages in Druidic have always been written on the southern-most side of the chosen object (or, if written in the land, they will be marked Top-Down from North to South).": "值得注意的是，在整个传统中，德鲁伊德语的信息总是写在所选物品的最南面（或者，如果写在土地上，它们会从北到南自上而下地标示出来）。",
	"The function of this is so that whenever viewed, the reader will be facing North — this way, Directional symbols in Druidic markings will always remain true to the surrounding geography (I.E. [North] will always mean forward, etc.)": "这样做的作用是，无论何时观看，读者都会面向北方--这样一来，德鲁伊标记中的方向性符号将始终与周围的地理环境保持一致（即[北]将始终意味着向前，等等）。",
	"If no directional is given, the subject is assumed to be nearby.": "如果没有给出方向性，则假定被摄者就在附近。",
	"Choosing which symbol to use as a primary message will often come intuitively to most druids based on the message they are attempting to convey, but in reality there are multiple ways which one might convey the same thing.": "对大多数德鲁伊来说，选择哪种符号作为主要信息往往是基于他们试图传达的信息而凭直觉做出的，但实际上有多种方式可以传达同样的东西。",
	"Something to keep in mind, though, is relationship that exists between the Primary Message and the surrounding symbols. Whatever you choose as the primary message will be the subject of whatever message you are attempting to convey.": "但需要记住的是，主要信息和周围符号之间存在的关系。无论你选择什么作为主要信息，都将成为你试图传达的信息的主题。",
	"What this means is if you, for example, create a symbol like this: ": "这意味着，如果你，比如说，创建一个这样的符号。",
	"[North/Ahead]": "[北/前]",
	"[Grove]": "[格罗夫]",
	"[Squirrel], [Sacred], [Ancient]": "[松鼠]、[神圣]、[古老]。",
	"What you are saying is that there is a grove up ahead that is ancient and sacred, which happens to be enhabited by squirrels. Alternatively, if you were to write a message like this: ": "你的意思是说，前面有一片古老而神圣的小树林，恰好有松鼠在那里栖息。另外，如果你写一个这样的信息。",
	"[Squirrel]": "[松鼠]",
	"[Grove], [Sacred], [Ancient]": "[树林]、[神圣]、[古老]",
	"What you are saying is that there is an ancient and sacred squirrel that lives in a grove up ahead -- which, who knows, maybe that is what you meant, but it's important to keep that distinction in mind.": "你的意思是，有一只古老而神圣的松鼠住在前面的小树林里--谁知道呢，也许这就是你的意思，但重要的是要记住这种区别。",
	"In situations where the Primary Message of a marking is a Humanoid, Creature or Object, using a Location modifier will indicate where said subject might be found.": "在一个标记的主要信息是一个人形、生物或物体的情况下，使用一个位置修饰符将表明在哪里可以找到上述主体。",
	"With a limited number of characters and symbols within the Druidic language, modifiers act as a way to get creative -- because, while some symbols might not make as much sense when used as Primary Messages, any symbol can act as a modifier with a bit of craftiness.": "由于德鲁伊语言中的字符和符号数量有限，修饰符是一种发挥创造力的方式--因为，虽然有些符号在作为主要信息使用时可能意义不大，但任何符号都可以作为一种修饰符，只要有点技巧。",
	"Over the years, certain symbols have taken on multiple meanings. For example, the modifier [Wrong] in druidic has long stood for the concept of something \"Unnatural\" or \"Unholy.\" See a desecrated section of land? That is [Wrong] land. Notice a tree that appears to be under the influence of evil magic? That is a [Wrong] tree -- or, even more accurately, a [Wrong] [Magic] tree.": "多年来，某些符号已经有了多种含义。例如，德鲁伊德中的修饰词[Wrong]长期以来一直代表着 \"非自然 \"或 \"不神圣 \"的概念。看到一片被亵渎的土地？那就是[错误的]土地。注意到一棵似乎受到邪恶魔法影响的树？那是一棵[错误的]树--或者，更准确地说，是一棵[错误的][魔法]树。",
	"Similarly, certain Forest/Fey Creature symbols have unique interactions with Places of Interest when used as modifiers. These unique differences will be outlined individually in the Symbols section ahead.": "同样地，某些森林/精灵生物符号在作为修饰符使用时，与兴趣点有独特的互动。这些独特的差异将在前面的符号部分单独列出。",

	"This symbol, along with the symbols for [Safe Ahead], [Patrols Ahead] and [Go Around] function as Warnings and are often found in the Primary Message or Modifier position, preceded by one of the 8 cardinal directions in the Directional position to notate which direction is being talked about.": "这个符号以及[前方安全]、[前方巡逻]和[绕行]的符号作为警告，通常出现在主要信息或修饰语的位置，前面是8个方向中的一个方向，以说明谈论的是哪个方向。",

	"This symbol is unique in that, when applicable, the arrowhead will change from left to right depending on which path the scribing druid sees considers the safest -- meaning, if the arrow is on the right side, go around to the right, if it is on the left side, go around to the left.": "这个符号的独特之处在于，在适用时，箭头会根据划线德鲁伊认为最安全的路径而从左到右变化--也就是说，如果箭头在右边，就绕到右边，如果在左边，就绕到左边。",
	"Place of Interest symbols are those that identify natural or man-made structures/locations ": "兴趣点符号是指识别自然或人工结构/位置的符号。",
	"This symbol is used to represent a river. It is sometimes followed by the [Bear] symbol as a modifier. Be wary of rivers that are often visited by bears, unless you are confident in your ability to soothe and communicate with them.": "这个符号用于表示河流。它后面有时会有[熊]符号作为修饰语。对经常有熊光顾的河流要保持警惕，除非你对自己安抚和沟通熊的能力有信心。",
	"This symbol is used to represent a lake.": "这个符号用来代表一个湖泊。",
	"This symbol is used to represent a cave.": "这个符号用来代表一个山洞。",
	" This symbol is used to represent a secret path. Often, this symbol is not preceded by a directional, but is instead given a modifier of a Forest/Fey Creature that acts as a guide if located. This is done in an effort to hide such a path from non-druid readers.": " 这个符号是用来代表一条秘密的道路。通常情况下，这个符号前面没有方向标，而是被赋予了一个森林/精灵生物的修饰词，如果被找到的话，可以作为一个向导。这样做是为了向非德鲁伊的读者隐藏这样的路径。",
	"If you see a Forest/Fey Creature modifier next to a [Secret Path] symbol, try taking a look around to see if you can find them.": "如果你看到[秘道]符号旁边有一个森林/翡冷翠生物的修饰词，试着四处看看，看看是否能找到它们。",
	"This symbol is used to represent a Ruin. It is sometimes followed by a [Dwarf], [Elf] or [Human] modifier, which is meant to represent the creators of the ruin -- but as with all Druidic messages, things like this can be unclear. It is just as possible that it is simply a ruin that is currently filled with Dwarves, Elves, or Humans.": "这个符号是用来代表一个废墟的。它后面有时会有一个[矮人]、[精灵]或[人类]的修饰词，这意味着代表废墟的创造者--但就像所有德鲁伊的信息一样，这样的东西可能并不明确。它也有可能只是一个目前充满了矮人、精灵或人类的废墟。",
	"This symbol is used to represent a Sanctuary. Sanctuaries, in druidic tradition, are places where druids often congregate -- they are generally very hidden deep within the forests or feywild, and similarly to Secret Paths, they often are not preceded by a Directional symbol. Instead, in a similar fashion, Fey/Forest Creature modifiers are used to represent nearby guides.": "这个符号用来代表一个圣所。在德鲁伊传统中，圣所是德鲁伊经常聚集的地方--它们通常非常隐蔽地位于森林或仙境的深处，与秘道类似，它们前面通常没有一个方向性符号。相反，以类似的方式，费伊/森林生物修饰符被用来代表附近的向导。",

	"This symbol is used to represent a nearby crossing into the Feywild, often in the form of a portal, door or a rift. Similar to the symbols for [Secret Path] and [Sanctuary], the symbol for [Fey Crossing] is sometimes followed by a Guide modifier in place of a Directional -- although, out of the three symbols, [Fey Crossing] would be the most likely to be preceded by a directional marking. ": "这个符号用来代表附近的一个进入仙境的通道，通常以门户、门或裂缝的形式出现。与[秘道]和[避难所]的符号类似，[费伊十字路口]的符号有时会用一个指南修饰词来代替方向标记--尽管在这三个符号中，[费伊十字路口]最有可能在前面加一个方向标记。",

	"It is said that some Druids are able to coax a bear into aiding for small time in battle in exchange for food -- but that is not a goal worth chasing as it is very dangerous. Bears are known to be extremely territorial, especially when accompanied by offspring. Always approach bears with caution.": "据说有些德鲁伊能够哄骗熊在战斗中协助一小段时间以换取食物--但这不是一个值得追逐的目标，因为它非常危险。众所周知，熊的领地性极强，尤其是有后代陪伴的时候。始终要谨慎地接近熊。",

	"This symbol is used to represent a Rock.": "这个符号是用来代表岩石的。",
	"Druidic is a very sparse language by its design. Things such as specifcs, numbers, etc. have always been said by the ancients to be something best left up to nature. As such, there will be moments where you will be left wondering whether or not you are about to face 3 orcs or 30. Heed the warnings of danger, and always tread carefully.": "德鲁伊语在设计上是一种非常稀疏的语言。古人总是说，诸如规格、数字等东西最好留给自然界来决定。因此，在有些时候，你会想知道你是要面对3个还是30个兽人。请注意危险的警告，并始终小心翼翼地行事。"
