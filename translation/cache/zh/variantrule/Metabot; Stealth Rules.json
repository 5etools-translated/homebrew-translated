	"A good stealth mission starts with the players entering from a direction orthogonal to where enemies expect them to come in. Thus the first areas are less well patrolled and the likelyhood of success is high.": "一个好的隐蔽任务开始时，玩家要从一个与敌人期望他们进来的方向正交的方向进入。因此，第一个区域的巡逻情况较差，成功的可能性很高。",
	"Show players the map generously, but use line of sight to determine if players can see enemies. These stealth rules work best when the map has clusters of open-ish areas that are cut off from other areas. This prevents a botched attempt at stealth from spilling over into the rest of the battle map.": "慷慨地向玩家展示地图，但使用视线来确定玩家是否能看到敌人。当地图上有一簇簇与其他地区隔绝的开放区域时，这些隐身规则效果最好。这可以防止一次失败的隐身尝试蔓延到战斗地图的其他部分。",
	"A stealth check is equal to highest passive Perception in the NPC group. Your group succeeds if half or more succeed. These rules don't overly punish a party with one or two low stealth players, but stealth remains relevant.": "隐身检查等于NPC群体中最高的被动感知。如果有一半或更多的人成功，你的小组就会成功。这些规则不会过度惩罚有一两个低隐身能力的玩家的队伍，但隐身能力仍然是相关的。",
	"<b>Minor fail:</b> a fail of less than 5, that enemy hears a sound that could be misconstrued as innocuous, or sees a glimpse of movement from the PC with the lowest roll.": "<b>轻度失败：</b>低于5的失败，敌人听到了一个可能被误解为无害的声音，或看到了一丝来自卷数最低的PC的运动。",
	"<b>Major fail:</b> a fail of 5 or more, or a fail that includes a natural 1, one of them spots the PC with the lowest roll.": "<b>重大失败：</b>失败5次或以上，或包括自然1次的失败，其中一次是以最低的卷子点到PC。",
	"As an aside: some magics, most notably pass without a trace, can trivialize stealth-focused missions. How you deal with it is up to you, but try to find ways to notify your players of the fabricated drawbacks as well as to give them some bonus.": "顺便说一句：有些魔法，最明显的是无影无踪，可以使以隐身为重点的任务变得微不足道。如何处理这个问题取决于你，但要尽量想办法让你的玩家知道这些捏造的缺点，并给他们一些奖励。",
	"When an enemy sees a PC, roll 2d4 plus the NPC's wisdom modifier and choose from the table below. If on low alert, roll 3d4 drop highest, and on high alert, drop lowest.": "当敌人看到PC时，滚动2D4加上NPC的智慧修改器，并从下表中选择。如果处于低警戒状态，则滚动3d4掉落最高，处于高警戒状态，掉落最低。",
	"All attacks that aren't sneak attacks are audible within 30 feet unless the attacker chooses to attack with disadvantage. Creatures who don't have a condition that reduce their speed to zero (such as grappled, restrained, or stunned) make a sound on their turn:": "所有不是偷袭的攻击在30英尺范围内都能听到，除非攻击者选择以劣势攻击。没有条件使其速度降至零的生物（如被抓捕、被限制或被击晕）在他们的回合中会发出声音。",
	"<b>Combat call.</b> 100 feet. Enemies make this sound when suprised and when coordinating attacks.": "<b>战斗呼叫。</b>100英尺。敌人在受到惊吓和协调攻击时发出这种声音。",
	"<b>Action call.</b> 300 feet. An unambiguous cry for help, requiring a creature to take an action.": "<b>行动呼叫。</b> 300英尺。毫不含糊的呼救声，要求生物采取一个行动。",
	"Sound requires an additional 20 feet to cross a door, 30 feet to cross a thin wall, and 100 to cross a thick wooden wall. Stone or brick walls block all but magically produced sounds. The question isn't whether or not the sound can be heard, but if if can be heard well enough to be recognized as suspicious.": "声音需要额外的20英尺才能穿过一扇门，30英尺才能穿过一堵薄墙，100英尺才能穿过一堵厚木墙。石墙或砖墙会阻挡所有的声音，除了神奇地产生的声音。问题不在于是否能听到声音，而在于是否能很好地听到，从而被识别为可疑的声音。",
	"In general, weigh heavily on selecting enemies with low defensive CR and high offensive CR (see DMG for more info). If possible, hotdrop players with an encounter of one of the basic enemies to force them to fight it so they know the strength of the weakest guy. This empowers the players to take on enemies that they feel as if they can deal with.": "一般来说，要着重选择防御性CR低、攻击性CR高的敌人（更多信息见DMG）。如果可能的话，让玩家遭遇其中一个基本的敌人，强迫他们与之战斗，这样他们就知道最弱的家伙的实力。这使玩家有能力去对付他们觉得自己能够对付的敌人。",
	"<b>Grappling.</b> at advantage if the creature isn't aware of you": "<b>擒拿。</b>如果该生物没有注意到你，则处于有利地位。",
	"<b>Distractions.</b> Player can attempt to distract enemies by throwing rocks, etc. Treat as minor fail at location.": "<b>分散注意力。</b>玩家可以试图通过投掷石块等来分散敌人的注意力。视作位置上的轻微失败。",
