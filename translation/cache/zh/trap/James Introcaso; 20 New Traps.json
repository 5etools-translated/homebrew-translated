	"This trap requires a spellcaster to carve a specific sequence of Abyssal runes into a doorframe using demon blood and diamond dust. The person who carves the runes chooses a passphrase in Abyssal.

The runes can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, but a character can feel the runes if it runs its hand along the frame and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. A character who knows Abyssal can determine the passphrase with a DC 15 Intelligence check, though sometimes the passphrase is more difficult to discover and a clever carver may hide it in a riddle within the runes. Dealing 50 damage to the door's frame renders the trap inert until it is repaired. The AC for the doorframe depends on the material of which it is made (wood AC 15, stone AC 17, metal AC 19).": "当最后一个符文被刻好后，这个序列就会消失在门框里。用DC15智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查可以发现这些符文，但如果一个角色用手沿着门框摸索，并在DC10智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查中成功，就可以感觉到这些符文。了解深渊的人可以通过DC15智力检查来确定密码，尽管有时密码更难发现，聪明的雕刻家可能会把它藏在符文的谜语中。对门框造成50的伤害会使陷阱失去作用，直到它被修复。门框的AC取决于它的材质（木质AC15，石质AC17，金属AC19）。",

	"At the start of every round add 3 feet of stagnant, opaque water to the sealed room. Once the water is 6 feet high, creatures without a swim speed who attempt to pick the lock using {@item thieves' tools|phb} do so with disadvantage. Creatures in the room without a swim speed must make DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) to swim above the rising water once it is equal to or greater than their height. Because the water is opaque, any creature who is submerged in the water is {@condition blinded} while it remains underwater.": "在每个回合开始时，在密封的房间里增加3英尺的不透明的死水。一旦水达到6英尺高，没有游泳速度的生物试图用{@item thieves' tools|phb}撬锁时将处于不利地位。房间里没有游泳速度的生物必须使出DC10力量（（%1%）），才能在上升的水等于或大于他们的高度时游到上面。因为水是不透明的，任何被淹没在水里的生物在水下时都会被（%2%）。",

	"Sometimes the designer of this trap will put a hidden kill switch somewhere within the room in case the trap is triggered by accident. Such a kill switch is usually well hidden beneath a stone in the floor or wall and requires a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to find. Pressing the switch causes the water to stop filling the room and the doors to unlock.": "有时候，这种陷阱的设计者会在房间里的某个地方放置一个隐藏的死亡开关，以防陷阱被意外触发。这种开关通常隐藏在地板或墙壁上的石头下面，需要通过DC20智力检查才能找到。按下开关，水就会停止灌入房间，门也会解锁。",
	"This 20-foot-square area has been cursed with a ritual that forms tendrils of pure necrotic energy that hunger to feed on the living.

	"Once the trap is activated the saw moves 40 feet along its track at the start of a round. The saw makes an attack roll with a {@hit 6|+6 bonus} against any creature in its path.

	"When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor causing the intruder to spill into the pit below, which is usually 20 or 30 feet deep, but can be deeper. Once the pit is revealed, it begins to widen. At the start of a round the pit's area grows another 5 feet on all sides as the floor begins to slide open. Creatures adjacent to the pit before it grows must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or fall into the pit. The pit may have spikes at the bottom as described in {@trap pits|dmg|page 123 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}}.": "当一个生物踩到盖子时，它就会像活板门一样打开，导致入侵者溢出到下面的坑里，这个坑通常有20或30英尺深，但也可能更深。坑一旦被揭开，就开始变宽。在一个回合开始时，随着地板开始滑开，坑的面积在四面八方又增长了5英尺。在坑扩大之前，与之相邻的生物必须做一个DC15的灵巧蓄力动作，否则就会掉进坑里。坑的底部可能有钉子，如{@trap pits|dmg|page 123 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}}中所述。",
