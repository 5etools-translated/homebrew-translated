	"Jethro sneezed again. Tibbits' curiosity he could endure; their insufferable shedding, he could not. ": "杰特罗又打了个喷嚏。蒂比茨的好奇心他可以忍受；他们令人难以忍受的脱落，他无法忍受。",
	"Tibbits, which are often called catweres, are small humanoid creatures which possess ability to turn into a common house cat. Most people believe that their race originated from a deluded wild mage that attempted to polymorph into a cat, but if you ask a tibbit, you'll get a different story every time. Tibbits are few in number, and their tendency to spread across the world leaves them lacking in racial unity. Much like the felines they resemble, tibbits are independent, curious, and quick in both body and mind. Rarely does a tibbit settle down, driven by a wanderlust that kicks in shortly after reaching adulthood.": "Tibbits，通常被称为猫人，是一种小型的人形生物，拥有变成普通家猫的能力。大多数人认为他们的种族起源于一个妄想变成猫的野生法师，但如果你问Tibbit，你每次都会得到一个不同的故事。提比人的数量很少，而且他们倾向于在世界各地传播，这使他们缺乏种族统一性。就像他们类似的猫科动物一样，提比特人独立、好奇、身体和头脑都很敏捷。很少有提比人定居下来，他们在成年后不久就开始了流浪的生活。",
	"Tibbits, as befits their heritage, are moody, curious, and sometimes arrogant. Many tibbits prefer the comforts of a fine meal, stiff drink, and a soft couch. Even the most decadent tibbit, however, eventually succumbs to the steady pull of its curiosity. A tibbit might spend years living off the treasures it won in adventure, only to suddenly strike out into the unknown once again.": "蒂比特，与他们的遗产相称，喜怒无常，好奇心强，有时还很傲慢。许多提比特人更喜欢舒适的美食、烈酒和柔软的沙发。然而，即使是最颓废的提比人，最终也会屈服于其好奇心的稳定牵引。一个提比特人可能会花数年时间依靠它在冒险中赢得的财宝生活，只是突然间再次向未知的世界出发。",
	"When dealing with others, tibbits show a similar capability to change their attitudes and posture depending on their moods. A tibbit might act relaxed and languid one moment, alert and inquisitive the next. They tend to have a slightly distant, arrogant attitude toward others, as if tibbits, as a race, share a colossal, secret joke over other intelligent creatures. Still, once a tibbit marks someone as a friend, few other creatures match their devotion. A tibbit might complain about a friend's needs or tend toward laziness, but when trouble arises they are dauntless allies.": "在与他人打交道时，提比人表现出类似的能力，可以根据他们的情绪改变他们的态度和姿势。一个提比特人可能在这一刻表现得放松和慵懒，下一刻则表现得警觉和好奇。他们往往对别人有一种略微疏远、傲慢的态度，就好像提比人作为一个种族，对其他智能生物有一个巨大的秘密玩笑。不过，一旦提比特人将某人标记为朋友，很少有其他生物能与他们的奉献精神相媲美。tibbit人可能会抱怨朋友的需求，或倾向于懒惰，但当麻烦出现时，他们是无畏的盟友。",
	"In humanoid form, tibbits are small, stealthy, dark-skinned people with pointed ears and catlike eyes. Their hair tends to grow thick and long, and males tend to grow sideburns. Their skin tones range from a tawny brown to black, but occasionally a tibbit has pure white skin. Their hair color matches the wide range of colors found in house cats, from pure white to striped silver to deep black. In their cat form, tibbits look like fat but energetic house cats. They appear identical to—and indistinguishable from—any common, domesticated breed.": "在人形状态下，提比特是小型的、隐蔽的、深色皮肤的人，有尖耳朵和猫一样的眼睛。他们的头发往往长得又粗又长，男性往往长着鬓角。他们的肤色从黄褐色到黑色不等，但偶尔也有提比人拥有纯白的皮肤。它们的毛发颜色与家猫的各种颜色相匹配，从纯白到银色条纹再到深黑色。在猫的形态下，提比特看起来像肥胖但精力充沛的家猫。它们看起来与任何普通的、被驯化的品种相同，而且无法区分。",
	"Tibbits view everything through their guise as house cats. As such, they see how other races act when they think no one else is around. To a tibbit, every intelligent creature is a bundle of secrets waiting to unfurl.": "Tibbits通过他们作为家猫的伪装看待一切。因此，他们看到其他种族在认为周围没有人的时候是如何行动的。对Tibbit来说，每一个聪明的生物都是一束等待展开的秘密。",
	"Tibbits tend to adopt names based on their physical traits and deeds. A tibbit kitten is given a nickname by her parents that reflects her temperament and appearance. When a tibbit comes of age, she adopts a name of her choice. Tibbits tend to pick names from other folk, usually based solely on the sound.": "提比猫往往根据自己的身体特征和事迹来取名。tibbit小猫的父母会给它取一个反映其气质和外表的昵称。当提比猫成年后，她会采用自己选择的名字。Tibbits倾向于从其他民俗中挑选名字，通常只基于声音。",
	"Strangers and business partners use the name a tibbit picks for herself, while the tibbit's close friends and family use the original nickname chosen by her parents. A tibbit allows only her closest friends to learn and use her nickname. A nontibbit given such a privilege has received one of the highest honors a tibbit can grant to an outsider.": "陌生人和商业伙伴使用tibbit为自己取的名字，而tibbit的亲密朋友和家人则使用她父母最初选择的昵称。一个tibbit只允许她最亲密的朋友学习和使用她的昵称。享有这种特权的非提比人已经获得了提比人可以授予外人的最高荣誉之一。",
	"As a tibbit travels the world, she adopts a surname that reflects her experiences and important deeds. A tibbit usually changes her surname after such an event, but her true name uses all of her adopted surnames from childhood onward, and not just her latest one. When two tibbits meet, they share these long-form names to express their pasts with one another.": "当一个提比人在世界各地旅行时，她会采用一个反映她的经历和重要事迹的姓氏。tibbit通常在这样的事件之后会改变她的姓氏，但她的真名会使用她从小到大所采用的所有姓氏，而不仅仅是她最近的一个。当两个tibbit相遇时，他们分享这些长形的名字来表达他们彼此的过去。",
	"Blackpaw, Glittereye, Longear, Patchfur, Quickfang, Tumblepaw": "Blackpaw, Glittereye, Longear, Patchfur, Quickfang, Tumblepaw",
	"Anisa, Leo, Mischa, Nikko, Shalimar, Soey, Tipp": "Anisa, Leo, Mischa, Nikko, Shalimar, Soey, Tipp",
	"Barrelrider, Cavelooker, Dogjumper, Shadeslayer, Wirewalker": "骑马者, 洞穴观察者, 跳狗者, 遮阳者, 走线者"
