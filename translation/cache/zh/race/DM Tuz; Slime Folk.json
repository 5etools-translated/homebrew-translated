	"Subject to their basest instincts, feral slime folk forego the desire to socialize in favor of experiencing new, interesting things to ingest.

	"Leading theories about the slime folk's origins range from being Juiblex's errant creation, the result of an accident of magical refuse, or a simple aberrant mutation from the underdark. What can be agreed is that the slime folk have a lineage with the monstrous oozes around the world, with whom they share many properties. They live between the surface and the depths of the underdark in sprawling colonies that house hundreds of slime folk. The slime folk are always willing to lend a helping hand, their social reach and habitats remain as spread out and flexible as their amorphous bodies.": "关于粘液族的起源，主要的理论有：是朱布莱克斯的错误创造，是魔法垃圾的意外结果，或者是来自地下世界的简单的反常变异。可以同意的是，粘液族与世界各地的怪异渗出物有血缘关系，他们与这些渗出物有许多共同的特性。他们生活在地表和地下世界的深处，在广阔的殖民地中居住着数以百计的粘液民。粘液族总是愿意伸出援助之手，他们的社会影响力和栖息地仍然像他们无定形的身体一样分散和灵活。",
	"Excitable, curious, friendly, and affectionate are all common descriptions for the average flime folk. They are constantly starved for stimulation, which is found in abundance on the surface. They revel in the many things they find outside of their homes and find themselves very quickly attached to any passersby who keeps them company. Slime folk are straight forward and docile creatures, commonly preferring the path of least resistance in their decision making. Only dire circumstances will force them to forgo their friendlyness.": "兴奋的、好奇的、友好的、多情的，这些都是对普通弗莱姆人的共同描述。他们不断地渴求刺激，而这种刺激在表面上是大量存在的。他们陶醉于他们在外面发现的许多东西，并发现自己很快就会与任何陪伴他们的路人产生感情。粘液族是直接和温顺的生物，通常喜欢在决策中选择阻力最小的路径。只有可怕的情况才会迫使他们放弃他们的友好。",
	"However, the slime folk's amicable nature can be a blessing as well as a curse. For one their malleable form left them with a skewered or almost absent sense of physical space or boundaries, for another they are very trusting. Even slime folk who have been repeatedly wronged and hurt might withdraw temporarily, but will eventually heal.": "然而，粘液族的友善天性既是一种祝福，也是一种诅咒。对于一个人来说，他们可塑性强的形式使他们对物理空间或边界的感觉被串联起来或几乎没有，对于另一个人来说，他们非常信任。即使是屡次受到委屈和伤害的粘液族也可能暂时退缩，但最终会痊愈。",
	"The form of the slime folk body is gelatinous, flexible matter: similar to their ooze relatives, they are able to bend, squeeze, morph, and adjust far beyond the capabilities of other typical humanoids. This however, doesn't make their bodies immune to damage from blunt trauma or exhaustion. Enough damage to their physical form will lead their bodies to lose stability and consistency.": "粘液民的身体形式是胶状的、灵活的物质：与他们的渗水亲属相似，他们能够弯曲、挤压、变形和调整，远远超过其他典型人类的能力。然而，这并不能使他们的身体对钝器创伤或疲惫的损害免疫。对他们的身体形态造成足够的伤害会导致他们的身体失去稳定性和一致性。",
	"Slime solk vary wildly in size, in spirit with their flexible nature. Commonly they average around the size relative to a human, though outliers towards the either extreme are not uncommon. Their gelatinous bodies have a translucent sheen that can range from clear to murks and feature a variety of colors. Some rare specimens might feature several colors manifesting in patterns or gradients.": "史莱姆-索尔克的尺寸变化很大，这与他们灵活的天性有关。一般来说，他们的平均体型与人类差不多，不过走向两个极端的情况也不少见。它们的胶状身体具有半透明的光泽，可以从透明到浑浊，并具有各种颜色。一些罕见的标本可能具有几种颜色，表现为图案或梯度。",
	"Being an ooze, the slime folk can taste with the entirety of their body - their sense is selective to prevent overstimulation. Further, the slime folk are able to store large amounts of fluids and food in their body, which can drastically morph and expand their size.": "作为一种渗出物，粘液民可以用他们的整个身体来品尝--他们的感觉是有选择性的，以防止过度刺激。此外，粘液族能够在体内储存大量的液体和食物，这可以使他们的体型急剧变形和扩大。",
	"Slime folk commonly do not see the need for names for one another within their colonies. But as contact with the surface world was made and the concept of names got introduced to the slime folk it became a trend that quickly caught on. slime folk choose their own names and know little about the deeper meaning and importance of names which they see as surface level accessories. This has lead to many of the slime folk's chosen names to be whimsical, tongue-in-cheek, or nonesensical.": "粘液民通常不认为有必要在他们的殖民地内为彼此起名字。但随着与地面世界的接触，名字的概念被介绍给粘液民，这成为一种趋势，并迅速流行开来。粘液民选择他们自己的名字，对名字的深层含义和重要性知之甚少，他们将其视为表面的配件。这导致了许多粘液族选择的名字都是异想天开、口无遮拦或毫无意义的。",
