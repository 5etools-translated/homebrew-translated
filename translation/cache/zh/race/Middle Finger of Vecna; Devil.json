	"The infernal creatures of hell are ageless, and on their own plane will only know death through the carnage of the Blood War. However, if transported to the mortal plane through portals or summoning magic, the hellfire they carry inside themselves will eventually sputter out. A devil that does not return to the lower planes will die within 10 years.": "地狱的生物是不朽的，在他们自己的世界里，只有通过血战的屠杀才知道死亡。然而，如果通过传送门或召唤魔法被传送到凡间，它们在自己体内携带的地狱之火最终会喷发出来。不返回下层世界的恶魔将在10年内死亡。",
	"Devils are almost exclusively evil and lawful, if contemptuous of authority. Failure and disobedience are met with swift demotion to a lower form of devil, to the lowest level of a wretched lemure.": "魔鬼几乎都是邪恶和合法的，如果蔑视权威的话。失败和不服从会被迅速降级为较低形式的魔鬼，降到最低级的可恶的莱姆。",
	"You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.": "你在黑暗和昏暗的条件下有卓越的视觉。你能在60英尺内的昏暗光线下看清东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中也能看清东西，就像昏暗光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Magical darkness doesn't impede your darkvision.": "神奇的黑暗并不妨碍你的暗视。",
	"You have resistance to fire damage.": "你对火灾伤害有抵抗力。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.": "你能说、读、写普通话和地狱语。",
	"It tore at the air eagerly with its claws as it came, its poisonous tail curled up beneath it to stab if need be. Elminster looked into the devil's exulting eyes. He felt a rash of warmth and the vinegarlike tang of its hide as its jaws gaped wide. Its head turned on an angle to bite out his throat. He fed it fire, searing claws and head alike to nothingness in an instant and letting it tumble away into the rocky darkness below.": "它来的时候急切地用爪子撕扯着空气，它的毒尾巴蜷缩在身下，如果需要的话，可以刺伤。埃尔明斯特看着恶魔那双兴奋的眼睛。当它的下巴张开时，他感到一阵阵的温暖和它的皮肉的醋味儿。它的头转了一个角度，要咬断他的喉咙。他给它喂了火，在瞬间将爪子和头都烧成了虚无，并让它滚落到下面的黑暗岩石中。",
	"Masters of corruption and despoilers of purity, devils seek to destroy all things good and drag mortal souls back with them to the depths of Hell.": "魔鬼是腐败的主宰，是纯洁的掠夺者，他们试图摧毁一切美好的事物，并将凡人的灵魂拖回地狱深处。",
	"Incarnate of evil, devils delight in cruelty. Their tools of choice are deception and violence, preferring these always to a diplomatic option whenever possible. However, this sadism is tempered by the cool intelligence which makes a devil far more deadly than a mundane monster. Their cunning and treachery allow devils to plan clever traps, playing on mortal fears and striking dangerous bargains to solidify power.": "恶魔是邪恶的化身，以残忍为乐。他们选择的工具是欺骗和暴力，在可能的情况下，他们更愿意选择这些工具而不是外交手段。然而，这种虐待狂被冷静的智慧所调和，使魔鬼比普通的怪物更致命。他们的狡猾和背信弃义使魔鬼能够计划巧妙的陷阱，利用凡人的恐惧和达成危险的交易来巩固权力。",
	"A devil's ambition is always tyranny. On the mortal plane, devils seek to manipulate humanoid rulers with whispered words and evil thoughts into abusing their power and causing strife. Whether through conquering, enslaving, or oppressing, devils take a perverse delight in exercising power over the weak.": "魔鬼的野心始终是暴政。在凡间，魔鬼试图用低语和邪念操纵人形统治者，使其滥用权力，造成纷争。无论是通过征服、奴役还是压迫，魔鬼都对在弱者身上行使权力感到不正常的快乐。",
	"The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. All devils have a place in the hierarchy, from the lowliest dretch to the godlike Archdevils. Devils who are fail grossly or are found to be lacking are demoted to lesser forms of devils, and those who demonstrate exceptional cruelty are promoted to greater fiends.": "九层地狱有一个严格的等级制度，规定了其社会的各个方面。所有的魔鬼都在等级制度中占有一席之地，从最低级的侏儒到神一样的大魔鬼。那些严重失败或被发现有缺陷的魔鬼会被降级为较低级别的魔鬼，而那些表现出异常残忍的魔鬼则被提升为更大的魔鬼。",
	"Chief among the devils, and second to none in the Nine Hells is Asmodeous. With all the powers of a lesser god, Asmodeous can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes, an ability which he uses, along with treachery and guile to maintain power over his Archdevils and hold the Throne of Baator for himself.": "阿斯莫德是魔鬼中的佼佼者，在九层地狱中首屈一指。阿斯莫德拥有小神的所有权力，他可以随心所欲地剥夺地狱等级制度中任何成员的等级和地位，他利用这种能力，加上背叛和欺骗，维持对大恶魔的权力，并为自己保留巴托的王位。",
	"Since time immemorial, a ferocious conflict has roared in the lower planes. Down below, the chaotic demons of the Abyss wage war against the equally evil, but lawful devils of the Nine Hells. Neutral fiends act as mercenaries, changing alliances whenever one side gains the advantage. The conflict is massive, spanning entire planes of reality, and hosting an immeasurable number of fiends.": "自古以来，一场凶猛的冲突一直在下层世界咆哮。在下层，深渊的混乱恶魔与同样邪恶但合法的九层地狱的恶魔开战。中立的恶魔充当雇佣兵，每当一方获得优势时就改变联盟。冲突是巨大的，跨越了整个现实世界的平面，并容纳了不可估量的恶魔数量。",
	"No one in the outer planes seems to have any real notion of what started the Blood War. The yugoloths like to entertain the notion that the War is their own personal experiment into the nature of evil, one which they created and will ultimately end on their own terms. Other fiends have their own notions about the war, colored by their particular alignments and racial propaganda.": "外界似乎没有人对血战的开始有任何真正的概念。尤戈洛人喜欢这样的说法：战争是他们自己对邪恶本质的个人实验，是他们创造的，最终将以他们自己的方式结束。其他魔族对这场战争也有自己的看法，这是由他们特定的结盟和种族宣传造成的。",
	"Though devils are confined to the lower planes, they can be summoned to the mortal plane by bargainers wishing to make a deal. Devils love forming pacts with mortals who seek some benefit or prize, but those making those deals should be wary. Though a devil always honors the word of his contract, which is enforced by Asmodeous himself, they are ruthless negotiators and rarely miss a loophole in a contract. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.": "虽然魔鬼被限制在低等位面，但他们可以被希望进行交易的交易员召唤到凡人位面。魔鬼喜欢与寻求某种利益或奖赏的凡人订立契约，但做这些交易的人应该保持警惕。虽然魔鬼总是遵守他的契约，这是由阿斯莫德本人执行的，但他们是无情的谈判者，很少错过契约中的漏洞。任何破坏这种契约的凡人生物都会立即丧失其灵魂，并被送入九层地狱。",
	"To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.": "拥有一个生物的灵魂就是对该生物的绝对控制，大多数魔鬼不接受其他货币来换取他们所能提供的恶魔般的力量和恩惠。只有神的干预才能在恶魔占有灵魂后释放它。",
	"Though each devil has a common name in their language of Infernal, it also has a true name it keeps secret. A mortal who learns a devil's true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service.": "虽然每个魔鬼在他们的地狱语言中有一个共同的名字，但它也有一个保密的真实名字。一个凡人如果知道了一个魔鬼的真名，就可以使用强大的召唤魔法从九层地狱中召唤出这个魔鬼，并将其捆绑起来为其服务。",
	"Azazel, Barabas, Balthazar, Diorum, Dogreth, Gargoth, Meritos, Nodroc, Ylvirron, Zakthara, Zammasir": "Azazel, Barabas, Balthazar, Diorum, Dogreth, Gargoth, Meritos, Nodroc, Ylvirron, Zakthara, Zammasir",
	"Barbazu, called bearded devils by most, serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes.": "巴巴祖，被大多数人称为大胡子魔鬼，作为突击队为大魔鬼服务，肩并肩地战斗，陶醉于战斗的荣耀。他们用暴力来回应任何轻视，不管是真实的还是想象的，当他们的地狱锯齿玻璃刀在敌人身上开出一条路时，他们就会大吃大喝。",
	"Your beard ends is sharp barbs and you have move it like a bed of snakes. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you may attack with your beard as a bonus action, treating it as a light, finesse weapon that deals {@damage 1d6} piercing damage on a successful hit. You do not add your ability score modifier to this damage.": "你的胡须末端是锋利的倒刺，你有移动它就像一床蛇。当你在你的回合中采取攻击行动时，你可以用你的胡子作为一个额外的行动进行攻击，把它当作一个轻巧的武器，在成功击中时造成{@damage 1d6}穿刺伤害。你不需要将你的能力值修正值加到这个伤害上。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.": "你对被魅惑或被惊吓的拯救动作有优势。",
	"Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either running errands for their infernal masters, spying on rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals. They resemble diminutive red-skinned humanoids with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings.": "小恶魔在下层世界随处可见，他们或是为他们的地狱主人跑腿，或是监视对手，或是误导和诱骗凡人。他们类似于矮小的红皮肤人形生物，有一条带刺的尾巴、小角和皮质的翅膀。",
	"You have a pair of leathery wings which grant you a fly speed of 20 feet. However, your wings are weak, and you can only perform sustained flight for a number of rounds equal to your level before suffering a level of exhaustion. By 10th level, your wings are sturdier and grant the ability to fly at a base speed of 25 feet. At 15th level, your fly speed increases to 40 feet and you may fly for any duration without exhaustion.": "你有一对皮制的翅膀，赋予你20英尺的飞行速度。然而，你的翅膀很弱，你只能持续飞行与你的等级相当的回合数，然后才会遭受一定程度的疲惫。到了10级，你的翅膀更坚固了，并赋予你以25英尺的基本速度飞行的能力。在第15级时，你的飞行速度增加到40英尺，并且你可以在任何持续时间内飞行而不感到疲惫。",
	"You know the {@spell thaumaturgy} cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the spell {@spell expeditious retreat}. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the spell {@spell invisibility}. Charisma is the casting ability for these spells. After casting a spell with this trait, you must finish a long rest to cast the spell again.": "你知道（%0%）的咒语。当你达到3级时，你可以施展该咒语（%1%）。当你达到5级时，你可以施展该法术（%2%）。魅力是这些法术的施法能力。在施放具有此特性的法术后，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次施放该法术。"
