	"Bugbears are most often evil. They have little respect for agreements of any sort, least of all law, and hold their own interests over those of others, even members of their own tribe.": "虫族通常是邪恶的。他们不尊重任何形式的协议，尤其是法律，他们认为自己的利益高于他人的利益，甚至是自己部落的成员。",

	"Skartu sat opposite the table from me, viciously tearing into his undercooked leg of mutton and drowning it with big gulps of ale. I questioned him about experience, both in battle and in using equipment, about his ability to follow orders, and about tactics that a mercenary of his stature should be familiar with. He responded to each with a nod, gulp, or burp, and at last asked his only question: \"How much 'ya payin'?\"": "斯卡图坐在我对面的桌子上，恶狠狠地撕咬着他那未熟透的羊腿，大口大口地喝着麦酒。我询问他在战斗和使用装备方面的经验，询问他服从命令的能力，以及像他这样的雇佣兵应该熟悉的战术。他以点头、大口喝水或打嗝来回答每一个问题，最后问了他唯一的问题。\"你付多少钱？\"",

	"Because of their strength and savagery, bugbears are much sought-after mercenaries and thugs.

Disarming a foe, or simply sundering a foe's weapon, are also popular bugbear tactics.": "虫人喜欢不光彩地战斗，在他们的敌人面前取得任何优势。在近距离的战斗中，虫人被称为用爪子抓，吐口水，把泥土扔到敌人的脸上，为致命一击做准备。解除敌人的武装，或者干脆撕碎敌人的武器，也是流行的虫族战术。",
	"Bugbear tribes are well known for ambushes, laying traps for superior forces, and fleeing when they have spilled enough blood. They are fiendishly hard to combat on even ground, even with superior numbers, due to their underhanded tactics and brute savagery. Often, bugbear raiding parties strike under cover of night, or use the level of terrain to their advantage, attacking unseen, and quickly departing.": "虫族部落以伏击而闻名，为优势部队设下陷阱，并在流够了血后逃之夭夭。由于他们的暗中战术和野蛮行为，即使人数占优，他们也很难在平地上作战。通常情况下，虫族突击队会在夜色的掩护下出击，或者利用地形的优势，在看不见的情况下进行攻击，然后迅速离开。",
