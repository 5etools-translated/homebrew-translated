	"A sirine is a beautiful, amphibious fey creature often found on beaches and riverbanks. Humanoids regard them as unpredictable and dangerous, but the reality is more nuanced.": "沙林是一种美丽的、两栖的费伊生物，经常在海滩和河岸发现。人类将它们视为不可预测和危险的，但实际情况却更加微妙。",
	"Hivebodies are the result of a kind of awakening, where magically infused colonies of insects develop a unique type of sentience. This might be the result of generations of feeding on the nectar of mystical flowers, or the inhabitation of an old wizard's tower. Whatever the origins, the outcome is extraordinary. Seamless communication amongst the drones and the queen creates a hivemind; and when that mind wishes to expand its knowledge by adventuring through the world, it must go about building and operating a Hivebody.": "蜂巢体是一种觉醒的结果，在那里被魔法注入的昆虫群落发展出一种独特的智慧。这可能是几代人以神秘花朵的花蜜为食的结果，也可能是居住在一个老巫师的塔中。无论起源如何，结果都是不寻常的。无人机和蜂王之间的无缝交流创造了一个蜂巢思想；当这个思想希望通过在世界范围内的冒险来扩展其知识时，它必须去建造和操作一个蜂巢体。",
	"A Hivebody is little more than a crude humanoid husk: a nest or mound or colony with working limbs. Inside the networks of tunnels and chambers that form the arteries and capillaries, the united insect host animate their makeshift being with uncanny teamwork. It may not often look it, with its lumpen, faceless heads or misaligned limbs, but a Hivebody is truly a marvellous feat of engineering. With their new body a colony can begin to explore the world, interact with other civilisations, and even forge an epic story of their own, all from the comfort and protection of an animated hive. The queen of the colony always sits within a dedicated chamber, placed roughly where the brains of other humanoids are found, in the ‘head' of the body.": "蜂巢体只不过是一个粗糙的人形外壳：一个具有工作肢体的巢穴或土丘或群落。在形成动脉和毛细血管的隧道和腔室网络内，联合起来的昆虫宿主以不可思议的团队精神使他们的临时生命充满活力。它可能并不常见，它的头颅笨重，没有面孔，四肢错位，但一个蜂巢体确实是一个了不起的工程壮举。有了他们的新身体，蜂群可以开始探索世界，与其他文明互动，甚至创造他们自己的史诗故事，所有这些都来自于舒适和保护的蜂巢。蜂群的女王总是坐在一个专门的房间里，大致放在其他人类的大脑所在的位置，在身体的 \"头部\"。",
	"Hivebodies can range from shapes as simple as a large wasp nest with some limbs attached, to studiously crafted pulpy shells that move with only slightly stiffened grace. A husk may be as small as 3 feet or as tall as 6, although they are rarely larger. Depending on the type of insect colony within, the construction materials might be reconstituted clay, silk, wood or other plant matter. Some queens will take great pride in crafting facial features and other flourishes over time–others are content with simply being mobile. A Hivebody might appear terifyingly misshapen, intricately alien, or strangely beautiful. In this way, almost by accident, the Hivebodies emulate and even exceed the diversity displayed by other races.": "蜂巢体的形状可以很简单，如一个带有一些肢体的大黄蜂巢，也可以是精心制作的浆状外壳，移动时只有轻微的僵硬的优雅。一个壳子可能小到3英尺，也可能高到6英尺，不过它们很少更大。根据内部昆虫群落的类型，建筑材料可能是重组的粘土、丝绸、木材或其他植物物质。一些蜂王会以制作面部特征和其他装饰品为荣，随着时间的推移，其他蜂王会满足于简单的移动。蜂巢体可能出现可怕的畸形，复杂的异形，或奇怪的美丽。通过这种方式，几乎是偶然的，蜂巢体效仿甚至超越了其他种族所展示的多样性。",
	"A Hivebody is a collective of life working together. The intelligence of the colony is communal: each member down to the lowliest drone contributes sense data, thoughts, and snatches of emotion to the whole. The queen embodies the most cohesive chunk of the hivemind and is its primary director. In return, the workers and soldiers perform the physical animation of the body and, if necessary, will charge forth from their mobile fortress to protect their quiescent queen. While any one portion of the colony lives–the queen in particular–the hivemind as an entity lives on as well. The insects are to a Hivebody what blood, tendons, and willpower are to other races.": "蜂巢体是一个共同工作的生命集体。蜂群的智慧是共同的：每个成员，直到最低级的无人机，都为整体贡献感官数据、思想和情感的片段。蜂后体现了蜂巢思想中最具凝聚力的部分，是它的主要主管。作为回报，工人和士兵执行身体的动画，如果有必要，他们会从他们的移动堡垒中冲出来，保护他们安静的女王。当蜂群的任何一部分活着时--尤其是蜂后--蜂巢思想作为一个实体也在活着。昆虫对蜂巢体的作用就像血液、肌腱和意志力对其他种族的作用。",
	"It is worth giving some though to the beginnings of your colony-turned-adventurer. Ask yourself some questions: How long ago did your intelligence blossom into a hivemind? Did you start travelling immediately, or was there an inciting incident? Where are you orginally from, and how far have you travelled already? A colony fresh to their new life might be more naive, open-minded and curious, whereas a Hivebody headed by a more seasoned queen may display more active ambitions.": "值得考虑一下你的殖民地变成冒险家的开端。问自己一些问题。你们的智慧是在多久前形成的？你是立即开始旅行，还是有一个诱发事件？你最初来自哪里，你已经旅行了多远？一个刚刚开始新生活的蜂群可能更天真，思想开放，好奇心强，而一个由更老练的蜂后领导的蜂群可能表现出更积极的野心。",
	"Every queen is technically female, but since the connected minds of the colony become both an individual and an entire civilisation, the culture of a Hivebody is unique, self-made. They may, or may not, choose to present as female, either through speech or the appearance of their husk. They may do away with the concept of gender altogether. Values are debated and determined internally with the same force as the cultural shifts of generations that take place in other civilisations. What is art? What is the best thing to get out of life? What is our foreign policy? The answers to these big questions are influenced as much by an internally unique set of traditions as they are by additional information received through exploration. Asking what is important to a Hivebody is akin to asking what is important to a nation. There will always be different opinions and pressures represented and weighed in the personality of the hivemind. Hivebodies are not fickle or capricious, but they are nuanced, and no one is like any other. The only thing they have in common is the will to see the world that compelled them to strike out from their burrows and jungles in the first place.": "从技术上讲，每个女王都是女性，但由于蜂群中相互联系的思想既是一个个体，也是一个完整的文明，所以蜂巢体的文化是独特的、自制的。他们可以，也可以不，选择以女性的身份出现，无论是通过语言还是他们的外壳的外观。他们可以完全摒弃性别的概念。价值观在内部被辩论和确定，其力量与其他文明中发生的世代文化转变相同。什么是艺术？从生活中得到的最好东西是什么？我们的外交政策是什么？这些大问题的答案既受到内部独特的传统的影响，也受到通过探索获得的额外信息的影响。问什么对一个蜂巢体来说是重要的，就像问什么对一个国家是重要的一样。总是会有不同的意见和压力，并在蜂巢体的个性中得到权衡。蜂巢体并不善变，也不任性，但他们有细微的差别，没有一个人和其他任何人一样。他们唯一的共同点是看世界的意愿，这迫使他们一开始就从他们的洞穴和丛林中出击。",
	"A queen is the ultimate authority on conscious decision-making in the colony and as such they name themselves. They might take up the name of an object of importance from their early days when the body was still a localised nest, such as a tree, rock, or other natural landmark. Or they might take up the name of a story character, overheard in the conversation of passing foragers. They may make up utter nonsense. It is up to each hive queen to decide on the importance of their name.": "蜂后是蜂群中有意识决策的最终权威，因此它们为自己命名。它们可能会采用它们早期的一个重要物体的名字，当时身体还是一个局部的巢穴，如一棵树、岩石或其他自然地标。或者，它们可能采用一个故事人物的名字，是在路过的觅食者的谈话中听到的。它们可能会编造一些完全无稽之谈。这取决于每个蜂王决定他们名字的重要性。",
	"As a Hivebody wanders and the queen's knowledge of the world grows, they may well choose to change their name, seemingly on a whim. Royal entitlement does not fade: they will expect any companions to address them correctly without need of a reminder.": "随着蜂巢体的流浪和女王对世界知识的增长，他们很可能选择改变自己的名字，似乎是一时兴起。皇家权利不会消失：他们会期望任何同伴正确称呼他们，而不需要提醒。",
	"Your Hivebody character has a number of unique attributes as the result of its unusual being.": "你的蜂巢体角色由于其不寻常的存在而具有一些独特的属性。",
	"A Hivebody ‘comes of age' essentially the moment an awakened queen is born or made by other means. The lifespan of a queen is short by the reckoning of other sapient species, ranging anywhere from 5 to 15 years. But her successor may well choose to inhabit the same body, and the Hivebody will continue. Drones grow, work, and die over the span of around 150 days and are constantly reproduced.": "一个蜂巢体的 \"年龄 \"基本上是在一个被唤醒的蜂后出生或通过其他方式产生的那一刻。按照其他有智慧的物种的计算，蜂后的寿命很短，从5年到15年不等。但她的继任者很可能选择居住在同一个身体里，而蜂巢体将继续存在。无人机在150天左右的时间里成长、工作和死亡，并不断繁殖。",
	"Hivebodies typically start out neutral. Once they make the leap from survival to exploration, their curiosity and the need to protect the hive remain defining traits for a lifetime. Where these drives lead the hive–to acts of callous immorality or to acts of great community–is entirely up to the developing personality of the queen.": "蜂巢体通常一开始是中性的。一旦它们实现了从生存到探索的飞跃，它们的好奇心和保护蜂巢的需要在一生中都是决定性的特质。这些驱动力将蜂巢引向何处--引向冷酷无情的不道德行为或引向伟大的社区行为--完全取决于蜂后的发展个性。",
	"Sustainable animated hives can be built in two sizes, Small and Medium. Choose one of these sizes, as detailed at the end of this section.": "可持续发展的动画蜂巢可以有两种尺寸，小型和中型。选择其中一种尺寸，详见本节末尾。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. In addition, Insight checks against you are rolled with disadvantage.": "你对被魅惑或被惊吓的拯救动作有优势。此外，针对你的洞察力检查是以劣势进行的。",
	"When hit by an attack, you may use your reaction to release a swarm of angered drones that fill the air in a 5-foot radius around you for 1 minute. Hostile creatures that enter the area for the first time on a turn or end their turn in this space must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d6 piercing damage + poison damage equal to your Constitution modifier on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The piercing damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 6d6 at 16th level. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this ability again.": "当被攻击击中时，你可以用你的反应释放一群被激怒的无人机，在你周围5英尺的范围内充满空气，持续1分钟。第一次进入该区域的敌对生物或在该空间结束其回合的敌对生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。这个蓄力的DC等于8+你的宪法修改器+你的熟练度奖励。蓄力失败时，生物会受到1d6的穿刺伤害+相当于你宪法修改器的毒药伤害，蓄力成功时则受到一半的伤害。穿刺伤害在6级时增加到2d6，11级时增加到4d6，16级时增加到6d6。在你再次使用这个能力之前，你必须完成一个短暂或长时间的休息。",
	"Colonies are used to eating piecemeal, using workers to gather edible detritus or nectar over the course of the day. Determine with your DM a suitable food for your colony: some examples include fungi, leaves (fresh or composting), lesser insects, or flower nectar. Collecting nectar from flowers also assists with local pollination. If travelling over suitable terrain, you may sustain the colony for 1 day by collecting food in this manner over 4 hours.": "蜂群习惯于零散地进食，利用工蜂在一天中收集可食用的碎屑或花蜜。与你的DM确定适合你的蜂群的食物：一些例子包括真菌、树叶（新鲜或堆肥）、较少的昆虫或花蜜。从花中采集花蜜也有助于当地授粉。如果在合适的地形上旅行，你可以通过这种方式在4个小时内收集食物来维持蜂群1天。",
	"You may otherwise eat and drink as normal.": "除此之外，你可以像往常一样进食和饮水。",
	"Once per day if you are not suffering from starvation you can produce 1 lb of Royal Jelly from any convenient orifice. When consumed, this substance restores 1 hit point and provides enough nourishment to sustain acreature for one day. A creature that eats the Jelly willingly will regard you warmly for the following 10 minutes and is considered charmed for this duration. Royal Jelly spoils after 24 hours.": "每天一次，如果你没有受到饥饿的折磨，你可以从任何方便的口中产生1磅蜂王浆。食用后，这种物质可以恢复1点生命值，并提供足够的营养来维持一个生物一天的生命。愿意吃果冻的生物会在接下来的10分钟内热情地看待你，并在这段时间内被视为被迷惑。蜂王浆在24小时后会变质。",
	"You must complete a long rest before you can use this ability again.": "你必须完成一次长时间的休息才能再次使用这个能力。",
	"If your body is completely destroyed (for example, in an attack that would cause instant death), flip a coin. On a heads your queen survives. A queen outside of a hive retains your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, has a Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution score of 3, and hit points equivalent to your first level maximum. She has a movement speed of 0 feet.": "如果你的身体被完全摧毁（例如，在一个会导致即时死亡的攻击中），掷硬币。如果是人头，你的蜂后就能活下来。蜂巢外的蜂后保留你的智力、智慧和魅力分数，力量、灵巧和体质分数为3，命中率相当于你第一级的最大值。她的移动速度为0英尺。",
	"If a queen is hand-fed and protected for 2d4 days, she will spawn a fresh brood of drones and can begin the process of building a new body. You may choose a Small or a Medium husk, even if your first body was a different size. This process takes 2d20+20 days regardless of the size chosen.": "如果一个蜂王被手工喂养并保护了2d4天，它将产下一窝新鲜的无人机，并可以开始建造一个新的身体的过程。你可以选择一个小型或中型外壳，即使你的第一个身体是不同的尺寸。无论选择何种尺寸，这个过程都需要2d20+20天。",
	" a chittering insectoid dialect sprinkled liberally with popular words and phrases that the colony find amusing. There is no written form of Buzzword–non-verbal messages are conveyed through a mix of synchronised dance and chemical markers.": " 嗡嗡叫的昆虫类方言，其中洒满了蜂群认为有趣的流行词汇和短语。Buzzword没有书面形式，非语言信息是通过同步舞蹈和化学标记的组合来传达的。",
	"Your queen communicates through rudimentary telepathy with a radius of 30 feet. This connection can only be used to broadcast speech to others. You cannot hear thoughts of any kind.": "你的女王通过基本的心灵感应进行交流，半径为30英尺。这种连接只能用于向他人广播讲话。你不能听到任何形式的思想。",
	"Hives of this type are usually between 2 and a half to 4 feet tall and weigh around 30 pounds. Your size is Small.": "这种类型的荨麻疹通常在2.5至4英尺高，重量约为30磅。你的尺寸是小的。",
	"Your body is light enough that it can be transported through the air with a concerted effort from the colony. While not wearing heavy armour you can hover a maximum of 5 feet above the ground and use your movement speed as normal, ignoring any grounded difficult terrain lower than your hover height. You must concentrate on this movement as if concentrating on a spell. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.": "你的身体足够轻，可以通过殖民地的协同努力在空中运输。在不穿重甲的情况下，你最多可以在离地面5英尺的地方盘旋，并使用正常的移动速度，无视任何低于你盘旋高度的地面困难地形。你必须专注于这种运动，就像专注于一个法术一样。你可以使用一个盾牌，并仍然获得这个好处。",
	"These larger hives can reach up to 6 feet tall and weigh between 140 and 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "这些较大的蜂巢可以达到6英尺高，重量在140至160磅之间。你的尺寸是中等。",
	"Your expanded sprawl of tunnels allows you to host a larger colony. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level.": "你扩大的隧道范围使你可以容纳一个更大的殖民地。在1级时，你的最大命中率会额外增加1，并且每当你获得一个等级时又会增加1。",
