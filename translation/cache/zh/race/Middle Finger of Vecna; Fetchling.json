	"Fetchlings reach maturity in their early 20s and can live to be over a hundred.": "飞鹤在20岁出头时达到成熟，可以活到100多岁。",
	"Fetchlings come from a realm of darkness, and do not value morality and high-mindedness as much as other creatures might. As such, they tend to be Chaotic.": "撷取者来自黑暗的领域，不像其他生物那样重视道德和高尚的思想。因此，他们倾向于混沌状态。",
	"You have superior vision in dim light and darkness. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "你在昏暗的光线和黑暗中拥有卓越的视觉。你可以在你周围120英尺内的昏暗光线中看到，就像亮光一样，而在黑暗中就像昏暗光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.": "当你、你的攻击目标或你试图感知的东西处于阳光直射下时，你在攻击卷和依靠视觉的智慧（感知）检查上有劣势。",
	"You can cast a horrific gaze upon your enemies. As an action, you can select 1 target that you can see and that can see you within 30 feet. This target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC for this save is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see you, ending the effect early on a success. A target that succeeds a saving throw against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.": "你可以对你的敌人投以恐怖的目光。作为一个行动，你可以选择一个你能看见的目标，并且在30英尺内能看见你。这个目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。这个救赎的DC是8+你的熟练度加成+你的魅力修改器。如果救赎失败，目标会在1分钟内变成（%0%）。目标可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果它能看到你，则处于劣势，如果成功则提前结束效果。一个对该效果蓄力成功的目标将在24小时内对其免疫。",

	"When we arrived at the appointed time, our guide was apparently absent. Jethro pontificated on the complexities about traveling the planes, even to one as near as the Plane of Shadow, and it was several minutes before we felt the presence of reflective eyes watching us from the shadows. When I noticed, I groped for my dagger and found only an empty sheathe. Jethro was disarmed of his bombs and we stood helpless, paralyzed for a moment.": "当我们在指定时间到达时，我们的向导显然不在。杰特罗喋喋不休地讲述着关于旅行平面的复杂情况，甚至到了像阴影平面这样近的地方，过了几分钟，我们才感觉到有一双反光的眼睛从阴影中看着我们。当我注意到时，我摸索着寻找我的匕首，发现只有一个空鞘。杰特罗被解除了炸弹，我们无助地站在那里，瘫痪了一会儿。",
	"Our guide, a gaunt humanoid with grey skin and large, round eyes, stepped out of the shadows and presented us with our own weapons.": "我们的向导，一个有着灰色皮肤和大而圆的眼睛的憔悴人形，从阴影中走出来，向我们出示了自己的武器。",
	"\"Where we're going, there are more dangerous things than I lurking in the darkness. Stay vigilant, and let nothing see your back.\"": "\"我们要去的地方，有比我更危险的东西潜伏在黑暗中。保持警惕，不要让任何东西看到你的背影。\"",
	"Stained by the Plane of Shadow's endless night, fetchlings were once ordinary men, but are now so different as to be unwelcome anywhere. So, with great disdain for the light their ancestors once enjoyed, they wander from plane to plane, finding safety and opportunity wherever they can.": "被阴影位面的无尽黑夜所玷污，费奇林曾经是普通人，但现在却变得如此不同，以至于在任何地方都不受欢迎。因此，他们对他们的祖先曾经享受过的光明非常不屑，他们从一个平面游荡到另一个平面，在任何可能的地方寻找安全和机会。",
	"Appearing as men drained of color, the fetchlings are descended from humanoids trapped on the Plane of Shadow. Generation after generation in this insidiously dark place has infused the race with darkness and made them a bleak shadow of their kin. Gaunt features, pale skin, and eyes which reflect brightly at night, are all signature traits of fetchlings, and it is not uncommon for the unlearned to mistake them for undead.": "撷取者的外表是没有颜色的人，他们是被困在阴影界的人类的后代。在这个阴险黑暗的地方，一代又一代的人给这个种族注入了黑暗，使他们成为他们亲属的黯淡阴影。憔悴的五官，苍白的皮肤，以及在夜晚反射出明亮光芒的眼睛，都是撷取者的标志性特征，没有学识的人将他们误认为是不死之身是很常见的。",
	"Ultimately, they are closer in kinship to tieflings and other outcast races, for a heritage of the dark imparts no goodwill from other races.": "归根结底，他们与铁皮人和其他被遗弃的种族的亲属关系更为密切，因为黑暗的遗产不会给其他种族带来善意。",
	"Fetchlings are originally native to the Material Plane but have been sequestered on the Plane of Shadow for centuries, implying that the secrets of migrating between the planes has long been known to the fetchlings. To see a fetchling apart from the Plane of Shadow is to see an outsider to your plane, or a recent descendant of one.": "撷取者原产于物质界，但被封存在阴影界已有数个世纪之久，这意味着撷取者早就知道在不同位面之间迁移的秘密。在暗影位面以外的地方看到撷取者，就是看到了你的位面的外来者，或者是一个最近的后裔。",
	"Fetchlings can find lucrative business as merchants, middlemen, and guides for those seeking to cross the planar boundaries. They can comfortably exist in both planes, and are reasonably well acquainted with the hazards, however, they are accepted by the denizens of the planes almost nowhere.": "撷取者可以找到有利可图的生意，作为商人、中间人和寻求跨越星球边界的人的向导。他们可以舒适地存在于两个位面，并且相当熟悉这些危险，然而，他们几乎无处不被位面的居民所接受。",
	"Fetchlings will choose to be alone before they will form a group, even with their own kind. The relish the solidarity the shadows provide and the type of wordless isolation that comes with the falling night.": "撷取者在组成群体之前会选择孤独，即使是和自己的同类。他们喜欢阴影所提供的团结，以及随着夜幕降临而产生的那种无言的孤独感。",
	"By contrast, they hate being the center of attention, and quite literally hate spotlights (and bright lights of any kind, for that matter.) Only when pursued or outnumbered is a fetchling likely to seek concord with others for any length of time. After the danger has passed, they rarely stick around, and have a reputation for simply vanishing into the night.": "相比之下，他们不喜欢成为注意力的中心，而且非常讨厌聚光灯（以及任何形式的亮光，就这一点而言）。 只有在被追捕或寡不敌众的情况下，撷取者才可能在任何时间内寻求与他人的和谐。在危险过去之后，他们很少在周围逗留，并有一个简单地消失在黑夜中的声誉。",
