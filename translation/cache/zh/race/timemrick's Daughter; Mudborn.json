	"A squeak of bubbles left the green-brown salamander's mouth as it noticed the toothed jaws of a shark. It narrowly avoids the bite and zips off to the village, hoping it can get to the labyrinth in time with the predator not to close behind. Laughter erupted as a golden salamander dressed in red robes told a joke, it raising it's small mug of ale before downing it like it was water. \"Another round, my friends?\" Breathing heavily, a black salamander starts to grow it's hand back as it swings an axe at its opponent. The bird creature screeched in pain as the blade sunk into its wing, the salamander giving a grin. \"Go to hell, feathered fiend!\"": "当它注意到鲨鱼的齿状下颚时，一阵吱吱的气泡声离开了绿褐色的蝾螈的嘴。它险之又险地躲过了这一咬，并向村子飞奔而去，希望它能及时赶到迷宫，而捕食者不会紧随其后。当一只身穿红袍的金色蝾螈讲述一个笑话时，笑声爆发了，它举起小杯的麦酒，然后像喝水一样喝下去。\"再来一轮，我的朋友们？\" 大口大口地喘着气，一只黑色的蝾螈开始把它的手往后长，因为它向它的对手抡起了斧头。当刀刃插入它的翅膀时，鸟类生物痛苦地尖叫起来，蝾螈露出了笑容。\"去死吧，带羽毛的恶魔！\"",
	"Mudborn are humanoid axolotls, a salamander stuck in their nymph phase. They have stubby legs and hands, their tails making up half of their body length and providing support for when they need waddle their way onto land. Six feathery gills protrude from the back of their head, three on each side, and look similar to horns from a distance. Usually seen with an adorable face that makes them look a bit derpy, however, some claim that they are more adorable when mad for their habit to try to appear scary.": "泥人是人形斧头鱼，一种停留在蛹期的蝾螈。它们有粗壮的腿和手，它们的尾巴占了它们身体长度的一半，当它们需要蹒跚地走上陆地时，它们的尾巴会提供支持。六个羽毛状的鳃从它们的头后面伸出来，每边三个，从远处看类似于角。通常看到的是一张可爱的脸，使它们看起来有点嘚瑟，然而，有些人声称，当它们疯狂地试图表现出可怕的习惯时，它们会更加可爱。",
	"There are five different subtypes of Mudborn, the most common being Mossys. Their namesake comes from the shades of green, brown, and black pigments in their skin that makes it look like they're covered in moss, flecks of shiny gold making their way into the mix, their gills a dark purple-grey color. Dalmatians are the second most common Mudborn, incredibly pale in comparison to Mossys. They tend to be white to a very pale pink and their back and head are typically covered in black speckles and their gills are a bright blood red due to having no pigment between skin and the blood vessels. Roses are very similar to Dalmatians in appearance, their skin a bit more rosy and lacking the black speckles alone their spine. Their eyes are pink or red instead of the black of Mossys and Dalmatians. The rarest of the Mudborns, Imperials, are golden in color with clear eyes and peachy gills and are the most similar to Roses. The last Mudborn, ranking as the second rarest, are Nightmares. These are quite possibly the kindest Mudborns out their despite these appearance and name. They are usually black or dark blue-grey in color with black eyes and dark blue/dark red gills.": "泥人有五个不同的亚型，最常见的是苔藓人。他们的名字来自于他们皮肤中深浅不一的绿色、棕色和黑色色素，这使他们看起来像被苔藓覆盖，闪亮的金色斑点使他们的皮肤混合在一起，他们的鳃是深紫灰色的。大麦町犬是第二种最常见的Mudborn，与Mossys相比，它们的肤色难以置信地苍白。它们往往是白色到非常淡的粉红色，它们的背部和头部通常覆盖着黑色的斑点，由于皮肤和血管之间没有色素，它们的鳃是明亮的血红色。玫瑰犬在外观上与大麦町犬非常相似，它们的皮肤更红润一些，没有黑色斑点，仅在脊柱上就有黑色斑点。它们的眼睛是粉红色或红色的，而不是摩西犬和达尔马提亚犬的黑色。泥人中最稀有的是帝国人，它们的颜色是金色的，眼睛是透明的，鳃是桃红色的，与玫瑰花最相似。最后一种泥人，排在第二最稀有的位置，是 \"噩梦\"。尽管有这样的外表和名字，这些人很可能是最善良的泥人。它们通常是黑色或深蓝灰色，有黑色的眼睛和深蓝色/深红色的鳃。",
	"All Mudborn have slimy skin coated in mucus to protect them from the salty waters of their home as well as to grant them certain resistances, based on their subtype. Mudborn, unlike normal axolotls, can climb out of the water, as long as they keep their skin and gills wet.": "所有的泥人都有粘稠的皮肤，涂有粘液，以保护他们免受家乡咸水的影响，并根据他们的亚型赋予他们某些抵抗力。泥人，与普通斧头鱼不同，可以爬出水面，只要他们保持皮肤和鳃的湿润。",
	"A Mudborn's native languages is called Bubbles, similar to that of morse code. It's most effective underwater, for it requires bubbles, but they also know Aquan and Sylvan to speak on land. Bubbles has no written components.": "泥人的母语被称为 \"气泡\"，类似于摩斯密码。它在水下最有效，因为它需要气泡，但他们也知道阿奎恩语和希尔文语，可以在陆地上说话。泡泡语没有书面成分。",
	"If History must be honest, Mudborns started out as a fae's experiment gone wrong. A fairy noble was wanting to create some servants and intended to create humanoid fairy dragons. However, the dragons tricked the noble and the fairy got Mudborn instead. Upset that they were tricked, the fairy kicked the first Mudborns out of the First World and into a lake, where they grew in population and spread out, migrating towards oceans for safety. They now live in underwater caverns to hide from bird monsters and sea beasts, a labyrinth in front of the entrance to their village to confuse predators, the predators usually dying in the dead ends because they can't turn around. Because of being a experiment with fae magic, they have some magical abilities relating to water.": "如果历史必须是诚实的，泥人一开始是一个异族的实验出了问题。一位仙女贵族想要创造一些仆人，并打算创造人形仙女龙。然而，这些龙欺骗了贵族，仙女得到的却是泥人。仙女因为被骗而感到不安，她把第一批泥巴人赶出了第一世界，扔进了一个湖里，在那里他们的人口不断增加，并向外扩散，为了安全而向海洋迁移。他们现在住在水下洞穴里，以躲避鸟类怪物和海兽，在他们村子的入口前有一个迷宫，以迷惑捕食者，捕食者通常死在死胡同里，因为他们无法转身。因为是异种魔法的实验品，他们有一些与水有关的神奇能力。",
	"The first Mudborns were Mossys, but as their numbers began to rise, mutations started to occur. At first, the mutated Mudborns were not accepted into society and outcasted, but they have since learned how to be more open-minded towards their brethren.": "最早的泥巴人是摩西人，但随着他们的数量开始增加，变异开始发生。起初，变异的泥堡人不被社会所接受，并被抛弃，但他们后来学会了如何对他们的兄弟更加开明。",
	"Mudborns, despite many misconceptions, are a carnivorous race of fierce hunters, feasting on mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. Some are known to catch crabs, shrimp, lobster, and fish to sell in port markets, as well as treasures they discover and drag to the surface while scavenging ships. While their adorable faces make it hard for people to say no to their offers, Mudborn are too kind to swindle people out of their money. Except for the very few evil Mudborn.": "尽管有很多误解，但泥鳅是一个肉食性的种族，是激烈的猎手，以软体动物、甲壳动物和小鱼为食。据了解，有些人捕捉螃蟹、虾、龙虾和鱼，在港口市场上出售，还有他们在搜刮船只时发现并拖到水面上的宝物。虽然他们可爱的面孔让人很难拒绝他们的提议，但泥巴人太善良了，不会骗人的钱。除了极少数邪恶的泥人族。",
	"One of the lesser fears of Mudborn were other humanoids such as elves, humans, half-orcs, mainly for their sheer size compared to Mudborn, but they have decided to look past the size difference to see their true selves. They admire an elf's grace, a half-orcs ferocity, and the human diversity. They bond closely with gnomes and are good friends to halflings, finding it easier to be around these small folk. They are wary of dwarves, however, finding these mountin dwellers rather intimidating, especially with their booming voices.": "泥人的一个较小的恐惧是其他人形生物，如精灵、人类、半兽人，主要是因为他们的体型与泥人相比太过庞大，但他们已经决定超越体型的差异，看清真正的自我。他们欣赏精灵的优雅，半兽人的凶猛，以及人类的多样性。他们与地精关系密切，与半身人是好朋友，发现与这些小人物相处更容易。然而，他们对矮人很有戒心，觉得这些山地居民相当可怕，尤其是他们那洪亮的声音。",
	"Mudborns cannot wear metal armor, it suffocates them for they do breathe through their skin. They, however, can find armor made of more natural materials such as wood and clam shells which don't impede on bonuses or stealth disadvantages. Typical Mudborn armor looks like scale mail made of shells and clams, as well as two bucklers that look like fish eyes, usually used to make them look like large fish.": "泥人不能穿金属盔甲，那会使他们窒息，因为他们是通过皮肤呼吸的。然而，他们可以找到由更多的天然材料制成的盔甲，如木头和蛤蜊壳，这不会妨碍他们的奖励或隐身的缺点。典型的泥人盔甲看起来像由贝壳和蛤蜊制成的鳞片状邮件，以及两个看起来像鱼眼的扣环，通常用来使他们看起来像大鱼。",
	"Mudborn create villages in their underwater caverns and tend to have a very structured society. Villages are lead by a council, usually consisting of at least one of each subrace of Mudborn so each gets a say, and of varying classes. During the coming of age ceremony on the year of the Mudling's 15th birthday, all the mudlings who had birthdays that year are gathered up on the last day. They spend the day competing in games and sport (these depend on the village), then are sent out to spend the night outside the safety of the village and aren't allowed even into the labyrinth. Those who survive the night (which most do, villages tend to be near bronze dragon lairs to keep the sharks away from their homes, which are the main predators in the oceans) have a big feast of shrimp and fish to celebrate they're coming of age. Mudborn have different roles in society, mostly dependent on their racial strengths. Nightmares tend to hunt, Dalmations explore alongside Roses, who are intent on finding new things to research. Imperials are commonly diplomats and ambassadors, while Mossys tend to lead their villages through their wisdom.": "泥人在他们的水下洞穴中建立了村庄，并倾向于拥有一个非常有组织的社会。村庄由理事会领导，通常由泥人的每个亚种至少一人组成，因此每个人都有发言权，并且有不同的等级。在泥人15岁生日那年的成年仪式上，所有当年过生日的泥人在最后一天被召集起来。他们花一天时间参加游戏和运动（这些取决于村庄），然后被派到村外的安全地带过夜，甚至不允许进入迷宫。那些熬过夜晚的人（大多数人都熬过了，村庄往往靠近青铜龙的巢穴，以防止鲨鱼远离他们的家园，而鲨鱼是海洋中的主要捕食者）会有一场盛大的虾和鱼宴，以庆祝他们成年。泥人在社会上有不同的角色，主要取决于他们的种族优势。恶梦倾向于狩猎，达尔马特人与玫瑰人一起探索，玫瑰人致力于寻找新的研究对象。帝国人通常是外交官和大使，而摩西人则倾向于通过他们的智慧领导他们的村庄。",
	"They get birth names, like every other race, but during the feast day of the coming-of-age ceremony, each mudling gets a name based on their accomplishments or their personality. They claim that their birth names are based off fruits and vegetables, but sometimes it's hard to see why. Mudborns go by both names, but some prefer one name to the other.": "他们有出生时的名字，就像其他种族一样，但在成年仪式的盛宴上，每个泥人都会根据他们的成就或个性得到一个名字。他们声称，他们的出生名字是基于水果和蔬菜，但有时很难看出原因。泥人同时使用两个名字，但有些人更喜欢其中一个名字。",
