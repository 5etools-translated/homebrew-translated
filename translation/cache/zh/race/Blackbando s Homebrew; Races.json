	"You have an alternate humanoid form. This form is of any Medium or Small race, however, aside from size, your statistics do not change while in this alternate form. You cannot change what this form looks like after you have decided how it does.

	"Once, we were brothers. Those times have long since past, now, I am afraid. I still remember when we were but children, and we thought that your 'evil' red skin meant nothing.

	"Long ago, the realms of the dead and the realms of the living were close enough to clash day after day, corpses rising moments after they are killed, ghosts possessing the living, and wraiths ruling the land. Out of the shadows of death and decay, the oni rose, with three kinds of their kin; red, blue, and white. The red were fierce and fearsome, tearing the foul spirits into pieces like wild animals. The blue were cunning and deceptive, looking for the right moment to assassinate powerful leaders. Finally, the white were honorable and just, sparing those whom surrendered, killing only those they had to. When the dead had been driven back, the realms separated once more, the red and blue oni took advantage of the gifts of the living, becoming tyrants similarly to those they had stopped. Seeing this, the white oni drove their kin out of the land, with the reputation of all oni being destroyed by their selfish cousins.": "很久以前，死者的境界和生者的境界近到可以日复一日地发生冲突，尸体在被杀后不久就会复活，鬼魂附在生者身上，鬼魂统治着土地。从死亡和腐烂的阴影中，鬼神升起，他们有三种亲属：红色、蓝色和白色。红衣人凶猛而可怕，像野兽一样将污秽的灵魂撕成碎片。蓝衣人狡猾而具有欺骗性，寻找合适的时机暗杀强大的领导人。最后，白色的人是可敬和公正的，放过那些投降的人，只杀那些他们不得不杀的人。当死人被赶回去后，两界再次分离，红色和蓝色鬼兽利用活人的天赋，成为与他们所阻止的人相似的暴君。看到这一点，白色鬼兽将他们的亲属赶出了这片土地，所有鬼兽的声誉都被他们自私的表亲破坏了。",
	"In many cultures after the fall of the oni, oni have been depicted as creatures of malice and destruction, laying waste to the land and people who surround them. While some oni attempt to go against this stereotype, they are still hated the same as the rest of their kin, forcing many oni to live an existence of constant running and travel. Many times, an oni may believe their only companions to be similarly hated creatures, such as orcs, or other oni.": "在许多文化中，在鬼神堕落之后，鬼神被描绘成恶意和破坏的生物，对土地和周围的人造成浪费。虽然有些鬼兽试图反对这种刻板印象，但他们仍然像其他亲属一样被憎恨，迫使许多鬼兽过着不断奔跑和旅行的生活。很多时候，鬼兽可能认为他们唯一的同伴是类似的被憎恨的生物，如兽人或其他鬼兽。",
	"An oni's greatest symbol of pride are their horns, with each oni having their own unique pair. No two oni have horns that are exactly the same, even the closest of relatives will have tiny differences in their horns. However, the horns of oni are also one of their most distinct traits, making hiding in societies particularly difficult for most of them. To combat this, oni have a natural ability that allows them to shift into a specific alternate counterpart, letting them blend in with other creatures. They also can display traits of their true form, such as their horns or sharp teeth, in this alternate form.": "鬼兽最大的骄傲象征是它们的角，每个鬼兽都有自己独特的一对角。没有两个鬼兽的角是完全一样的，即使是最亲近的亲属，他们的角也会有微小的差异。然而，鬼兽的角也是它们最明显的特征之一，这使得它们中的大多数人很难隐藏在社会中。为了解决这个问题，鬼兽有一种天生的能力，可以让它们转变为一个特定的另类对应物，让它们与其他生物融为一体。他们还可以在这种交替形态下显示其真实形态的特征，如他们的角或尖牙。",
	"Oni are very close to their families, with many believing that all strangers only bring pain and suffering. They display their family's name before their own, to show their pride that their relatives bring them, as well as to intimidate those who have wronged their family before. The names that they take on all have meaning in their native tongue, Wuxian, usually relating to positive characteristics the parents wish for their child to take on.": "Oni与他们的家人非常亲近，许多人认为所有陌生人只会带来痛苦和折磨。他们在自己的名字前显示自己家族的名字，以显示他们的亲戚给他们带来的自豪感，同时也是为了恐吓那些曾经伤害过他们家族的人。他们所取的名字在他们的母语武仙语中都有意义，通常与父母希望他们的孩子所具有的积极特征有关。",
