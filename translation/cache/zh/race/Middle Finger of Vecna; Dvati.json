	"A 'single' dvati is a pair of creatures that share a single soul. They are inextricably linked, and can no more exist separately than a human can exist without his heart. In spite of having two bodies, dvati twins perform as a single character, with the following differences:": "一个 \"单一 \"的dvati是一对共享一个灵魂的生物。他们之间有着千丝万缕的联系，不能单独存在，就像人没有心脏也不能存在一样。尽管有两个身体，但德瓦提双胞胎作为一个单一的角色进行表演，有以下区别。",
	"Dvati twins have a single action, bonus action, and reaction, between them, each of which can be taken only once by one of the twins on your turn. If you take the {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, {@action Dodge}, {@action Help}, {@action Hide}, {@action Ready}, or {@action Search} actions, both twins perform the action and gain its benefits.": "Dvati双胞胎之间有一个行动、奖励行动和反应，每个行动在你的回合中只能由双胞胎中的一个采取一次。如果你采取{@action Dash}、{@action Disengage}、{@action Dodge}、{@action Help}、{@action Hide}、{@action Ready}或{@action Search}的行动，双胞胎都会执行该行动并获得其好处。",

You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.": "如果你采取{@action Attack}行动来攻击一个双胞胎，另一个双胞胎可以作为额外行动来攻击。你不会在额外攻击的伤害上加上你的能力修改器，除非该修改器是负的。",

	"Dvati twins have separate hit points, which are divided between them. At 1st level, each twin has the hit points of a human of the same class.

	"When a dvati twin is reduced to 0 hit points and begins to make death saving throws, its twin becomes incapacitated, and able to move at only half speed.

	"It was like looking at a reflection in a mirror, except both of them could swing a sword at me. Before I knew it, I was outflanked and trying to duel the same person twice. I was on my back foot, and then I was just on my back. When they sheathed their identical rapiers and helped me up, I couldn't even tell which one I had offended in the first place.": "这就像看镜子里的倒影一样，只不过他们两个人都能向我挥剑。在我意识到之前，我被包抄了，并试图与同一个人决斗两次。我先是后脚，然后就是背对着我。当他们把相同的剑出鞘并把我扶起来时，我甚至分不清我首先得罪的是哪一个。",
	"A perfect pair, entwined for life, dvati are at once two beings and a single creature, a single soul living in two separate bodies.": "一对完美的组合，终身纠缠在一起，dvati同时是两个生命和一个生物，一个灵魂生活在两个独立的身体里。",
	"Twins being born is by no means an uncommon occurrence, but sometimes they may have more in common than just appearances. Dvati are born as identical twins throughout the planes with a single identical soul shared between them. The twins act like a single paired organism, with two bodies and two minds acting with a single purpose. Ancient folklore claims that dvati are born with souls too large for one body, and therefore must house them in two.": "双胞胎的诞生绝非罕见，但有时他们的共同点可能不仅仅是外表。德瓦提在整个星球上以同卵双胞胎的形式出生，他们之间共享一个相同的灵魂。这对双胞胎的行为就像一个单一的成对的生物体，两个身体和两个头脑以一个目的行动。古老的民间传说称，德瓦提出生时的灵魂对一个身体来说太大，因此必须把它们放在两个身体里。",
	"Dvati twins are skilled combatants, capable of strategizing in unison, and versatile spellcasters, able to conduct spells through one another. The benefits of having two bodies, however, is certainly balanced by its risks. Dvati twins cannot exist separately, and if one is killed or injured, it endangers the lives of both.": "德瓦提双胞胎是熟练的战斗人员，能够统一制定战略，也是多才多艺的施法者，能够通过彼此进行施法。然而，拥有两个身体的好处当然也被其风险所平衡。德瓦提双胞胎不能单独存在，如果其中一个被杀或受伤，会危及两个人的生命。",
	"Dvati twins always travel together and tend to seek out other pairs of twins. When enough twins congregate, dvati are known to form towns and villages of their own. These are tightly-knit communities, for close cooperation is second nature to dvati, who view their settlements as a bastion of unity in an otherwise disconnected world.": "德瓦蒂双胞胎总是在一起旅行，并倾向于寻找其他的双胞胎组合。当有足够的双胞胎聚集在一起时，德瓦提人就会形成自己的城镇和村庄。这些都是紧密结合的社区，因为密切合作是德瓦提人的第二天性，他们把自己的定居点看作是在一个互不相干的世界中团结的堡垒。",
	"Working in perfect synchronicity is a dvati's usual state. As such, these twins find the relative discord of other creatures to be confusing, or at worst, distressing. They often spin parables about ants, wolves, and other cooperative creatures to illustrate how people should behave in harmony to better themselves. Such stories usually fall on deaf ears, for most creatures cannot relate to the close association that dvati share, but neither can dvati understand how it is to be alone.": "在完美的同步性中工作是德瓦提的通常状态。因此，这些双胞胎发现其他生物的相对不和谐是令人困惑的，或者在最坏的情况下，令人苦恼。他们经常编造关于蚂蚁、狼和其他合作性生物的寓言故事，以说明人们应该如何和谐地行事以改善自己。这样的故事通常会被当成耳边风，因为大多数生物无法与德瓦提分享的亲密关系联系起来，但德瓦提也无法理解孤独是怎么回事。",
	"Dvati twins are born into normal human families, and are therefore named as other humans. However, if a diviner foretells the birth of dvati twins, it is often customary to give them similar, rhyming names, so that the twins can feel more whole.": "德瓦提双胞胎出生在正常的人类家庭中，因此被命名为其他人类。然而，如果占卜者预言了德瓦提双胞胎的诞生，通常的习惯是给他们起类似的、押韵的名字，这样双胞胎可以感觉更完整。",
	"Amrod and Amras, Corin and Corvin, Giles and Files, Jovan and Joran, Landon and London, Zane and Zost.": "阿姆罗德和阿姆拉斯，科林和科文，吉尔斯和档案，约凡和约兰，兰顿和伦敦，赞恩和佐斯特。",
	"Bree and Ski, Cilia and Hilia, Dora and Kora, Kara and Mera, Mello and Yellow, Tellia and Talia.": "布里和斯基，西莉亚和希莉亚，多拉和科拉，卡拉和梅拉，梅洛和黄，特利亚和塔利亚。"
