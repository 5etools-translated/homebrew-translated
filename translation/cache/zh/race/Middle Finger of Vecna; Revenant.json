	"Regardless of their lot in life, all revanants share a similar fate in death, and have a number of abilities with which to exact vengeance.": "不管他们生前的命运如何，所有复仇者在死亡时都有相似的命运，并有一些能力来进行报复。",
	"Revenants will maintain their presence in the world for exactly 10 years from the moment they become undead, after that time they permanently lose their grip on the mortal coil, the soul is pulled (willing or not) back to the afterlife, and the inhabited body crumbles into dust.": "亡灵从成为亡灵的那一刻起，将在这个世界上维持整整10年的时间，在那之后，他们将永久地失去对凡间的控制，灵魂被拉回（不管是否愿意）来世，而居住在其中的身体则碎裂成尘。",
	"Revenants are almost single-minded in their want for vengeance, as such they will tend toward a Chaotic alignment. Beyond this, their exact methods can lean towards Good, Neutral, or Evil, depending on the philosophies they learned in life.": "亡灵在复仇方面几乎是一心一意的，因此他们会倾向于混乱的取向。除此之外，他们的具体方法可以倾向于善良、中立或邪恶，这取决于他们在生活中学到的哲学。",
	"Revenants may possess the same body they did in life, or they may possess the remains of a being from any other humanoid race. Regardless, a revenant's size will always be Medium.": "亡灵可能拥有他们生前的身体，或者他们可能拥有任何其他人形种族的遗体。无论怎样，复仇者的体型总是中等的。",
	"Due to the magic which drives you, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "由于驱动你的魔法，你在黑暗和昏暗的条件下有卓越的视觉。你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线中看到，就像亮光一样，而在黑暗中就像暗光一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Your type is Undead, though you may still be targeted by effects which target only humanoids, if such an effect does not specifically exclude undead. You cannot be raised from the dead, nor can you be banished from the Material Plane before your time is up.": "你的类型是亡灵，尽管你仍然可以被只针对人类的效果所针对，如果这种效果没有特别排除亡灵的话。你不能起死回生，也不能在你的时间结束前被驱逐出物质界。",
	"You do not eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. However, to maintain sanity, you must meditate for 4 continuous hours daily, after which you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. You can still be placed into a torpor by sleep-inducing magic.": "你不吃、不喝、不睡、不呼吸。然而，为了保持理智，你必须每天连续冥想4个小时，之后你会从8小时的睡眠中获得与人类相同的好处。你仍然可以被诱导睡眠的魔法安置在昏睡状态中。",
	"You are immune to effects that turn undead.": "你对变成亡灵的效果免疫。",
	"You know the distance to and direction of any creature against which you seek revenge, even if the creature and the revenant are on different planes of existence. No magic can shield a hunted creature from this effect; they may run, but they cannot hide. You are instantly aware if the creature you are tracking dies.": "你知道与你寻求复仇的任何生物的距离和方向，即使该生物和复仇者处于不同的存在平面。没有任何魔法可以保护被追杀的生物免受此影响；他们可以跑，但不能躲。如果你所追踪的生物死亡，你会立即意识到。",
	"Revenants are unaffected by most healing magic, fortunately revenants also possess extraordinary regenerative powers. You cannot regain hit points from spells.": "亡灵不受大多数治疗魔法的影响，幸运的是亡灵也拥有非凡的再生能力。你不能从法术中恢复击中点。",
	"You gain a regeneration point, which can be expended as a bonus action to regain hit points equal to {@dice 1d10} points + your Constitution modifier, up to your hit point maximum. You gain one additional regeneration point at 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th and 20th level. You regain all expended regeneration points when you take a long rest.": "你获得一个再生点，可以作为额外行动消耗，以恢复相当于{@dice 1d10}点+你的体质修改器的命中率，直至你的命中率上限。你在第4、7、10、13、16、19和20级时获得一个额外的再生点。当你长时间休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的再生点。",
	"Your appearance is terrifying to behold. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.": "你的外表让人感到恐惧。你获得恐吓技能的熟练度。",
	"You speak Common and one other language you knew in life.": "你会说普通话和一种你在生活中知道的其他语言。",
	"You are a revenant, a soul which met a cruel and unjust end in life, and has clawed its way back from death for the sole purpose of revenge. You have sworn to kill those responsible for your demise, and possess a recently deceased corpse to do so (which may not be the same body you possessed in life); as such your appearance is the same as that of a common zombie.": "你是一个复仇者，一个在生活中遇到残酷和不公正的结局的灵魂，为了复仇的唯一目的从死亡中爬了回来。你发誓要杀死那些对你的死亡负有责任的人，并拥有一具刚刚死去的尸体来做这件事（这可能不是你生前拥有的那具尸体）；因此你的外表与普通僵尸一样。",
	"An ordinary revenant has exactly one year to seek vengeance, and will return to death either when its revenge is complete, or when its time is up. However, you are blessed with an entire decade. Once your revenge is complete, you may then choose to return to the afterlife at any time, or wait for your remaining time to run out. The reason for this may be that you are favored by a divine power, or perhaps you have struck a deal with a great extra-planar being who acts much as a patron would to a warlock.": "一个普通的复仇者有整整一年的时间来寻求复仇，当它的复仇完成时，或者当它的时间结束时，它将返回死亡。然而，你被祝福有整整十年的时间。一旦你的复仇完成，你就可以选择在任何时候返回来世，或者等待你的剩余时间耗尽。这样做的原因可能是你被一种神圣的力量所眷顾，或者是你与一个伟大的星外生物达成了协议，他的行为就像一个术士的守护神一样。",
	"A standard revenant can withstand extreme punishment, with powerful regenerative abilities and the power to survive the destruction of its host body, being able to find and inhabit a new corpse after twenty-four hours. You are not so resilient, the same magic that allows your presence to remain for so much longer than normal also binds you to your first host body. It can still regenerate, but to a lesser extent than other revenants. If the host body is damaged beyond its limit, you will be cast back into true death forever.": "一个标准的复仇者可以承受极端的惩罚，具有强大的再生能力和在其宿主身体被摧毁后生存的能力，能够在二十四小时后找到并居住在一个新的尸体上。你就没有这么强的复原力了，让你的存在比正常情况下保持得更久的同样的魔法也把你和你的第一个宿主身体绑在一起。它仍然可以再生，但程度比其他复仇者要小。如果宿主身体的损坏超过了它的极限，你将被永远投回真正的死亡。",
	"When you create a revenant, consider what forced your rage to return you to the mortal world. How did you die? Who do you seek vengeance against? What was your life like before your undeath? Do you still have your original body, if not, how do you feel about your new one? Work closely with your DM to determine how much your task will factor into the campaign. Perhaps it will form a key focus or perhaps it will even fit into the down time between adventures. Maybe you have even finished your work and are living out the remaining years before you expire once again.": "当你创造一个复仇者时，考虑是什么迫使你的愤怒将你送回凡间。你是怎么死的？你要向谁复仇？在你未死之前，你的生活是什么样的？你是否还有原来的身体，如果没有，你对你的新身体有什么感觉？与你的DM密切合作，以确定你的任务将在活动中占多大比重。也许它将形成一个关键的焦点，也许它甚至会适合于冒险之间的休息时间。也许你甚至已经完成了你的工作，并在你再次过期前度过了剩余的岁月。",
	"Take time to consider your character's attitude to the world. A revenant exists for exacting revenge, but could still have favored downtime pursuits and tastes. A revenant could be bitter about its hand in fate but could also be overjoyed at its luck at being returned to exact just desserts; a sad origin doesn't have to mean a miserable character.": "花点时间考虑你的角色对世界的态度。一个复仇者是为了复仇而存在的，但他仍然可以在闲暇时有自己喜欢的追求和品味。复仇者可以对自己的命运感到痛苦，但也可以对自己被送回的运气感到欣喜，因为它可以得到应有的报应；悲惨的出身不一定意味着一个悲惨的角色。",
	"Revenants born of rage often have little care for those they must defeat on the way to their primary target. They are driven by the purest hatred.": "由愤怒而生的亡灵通常对他们在去往主要目标的路上必须击败的人不屑一顾。他们被最纯粹的仇恨所驱使。",
	"Your blood is completely still, you have advantage to all rolls made to resist being poisoned.": "你的血液完全静止，你在所有抵御中毒的卷轴上都有优势。",
	"You can gain advantage on an attack against an opponent who has dealt damage to you in the last round, or against a creature under the effect of your Vengeful Tracker trait. After using this trait, you must complete a long rest before you use it again.": "你可以在对上一回合对你造成伤害的对手，或对受到你的复仇追踪者特质影响的生物的攻击中获得优势。在使用此特质后，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",
	"Deep, heart-wrenching sorrow gives birth to revenants consumed with grief. Often, these revenants not only mourn their own demise, but the unjust demise of a loved one, which drives them to vengeance.": "深深的、令人心碎的悲伤催生了被悲伤吞噬的复仇者。通常，这些复仇者不仅哀悼自己的死亡，而且哀悼所爱之人的不公正死亡，这驱使他们去复仇。",
	"Reflection on your mortality has allowed you to better understand the difficulties of life. You can make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with advantage. After using this trait, you must complete a long rest before you use it again.": "对自己死亡的反思让你更好地理解生活的困难。你可以以优势进行魅力（劝说）或智慧（动物处理）检查。在使用这个特质后，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",
	"You force one opponent to share in the pain you feel in undeath. As a reaction when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on the roll. After using this trait, you must complete a long rest before you use it again.": "你强迫一个对手分享你在死亡中感受到的痛苦。当一个生物对你进行攻击时，作为反应，你可以强迫该生物进行智慧救赎，否则在攻击中处于劣势。在使用这个特质后，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次使用它。"
