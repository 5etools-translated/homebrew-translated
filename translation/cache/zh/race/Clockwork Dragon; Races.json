	"Your Wisdom and Intelligence scores both increase by 1.": "你的智慧和智力分数都增加1。",
	"Aeramanu live similar life-span to that of their human counterparts, but their cultural proclivity for taboos means few shy away from extending this lifespan using unwholesome magic or similarly unsavoury means.": "爱拉曼努人的寿命与人类相似，但他们的文化倾向于禁忌，这意味着很少有人敢于使用不健康的魔法或类似的不光彩手段来延长这种寿命。",
	"Though steeped in shadows of necromancy and other dark fascinations, Aeramanu are not definably good or evil, and often seek such things purely out of curiosity. As a whole, the deep traditions of Aeramnu culture push children towards more lawful alignments.": "虽然沉浸在亡灵巫术和其他黑暗迷恋的阴影中，但爱拉曼努人并没有明确的善恶之分，他们往往纯粹是出于好奇而寻找这种东西。整体而言，爱拉曼努文化的深厚传统将孩子们推向更合法的方向。",
	"Aeramanu average slightly taller than many other races, rarely falling below 6 ft in adult height. Your size category is medium.": "Aeramanu平均比许多其他种族略高，成年后的身高很少低于6英尺。你的体型类别是中等。",
	"​No faster than an average human, your speed is 30 feet.": "不比普通人快，你的速度是30英尺。",
	"While flightless, Aeramanu still retain the hollow bones of their avian heritage, making them exceptionally light for their size. You calculate fall damage as if the distance fallen were halved.": "虽然不会飞，但Aeramanu仍然保留了它们鸟类的空心骨骼，使它们的体型异常轻盈。你在计算坠落伤害时，就像坠落的距离减半一样。",
	"Aeramanu excel at all things arcane, and have been practicing magic since long before most races first dabbled in the arcane arts. You gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Choose wisdom or intelligence as your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "爱拉曼努人擅长所有的奥术，并且在大多数种族首次涉足奥术之前就已经开始练习魔法了。你可以从巫师的法术列表中选择两个咒语。选择智慧或智力作为你对这些法术的施法能力。",
	"Common, Aeramanu, and your choice of one other.": "普通，爱拉曼奴，以及你选择的另一个。",
	"Aeramanu Society is built around a strict caste system, ruled over by three Great Houses. These houses, like large families, govern every aspect of Aeramanu society, and the house an Aeramanu is born into, or under which their family serves defines the role they are expected to full fill within the world.": "爱拉曼努社会是围绕着严格的种姓制度建立起来的，由三个大院子统治着。这些家族就像大家庭一样，管理着爱拉曼努社会的方方面面，爱拉曼努人出生在哪个家族，或者他们的家族在哪个家族下服务，决定了他们在这个世界上所要充当的角色。",
	"Victor Stein's feathers ruffled with anticipation such that he had never felt. He had worked his entire life towards this moment. Twenty Feet in front of him sat the Seed of Darkness - the sole, irreparable source of all evil and madness in the world - and the answer to his single, burning, question.": "维克多-斯坦因因期待而皱起了眉头，这是他从未感受过的。他一生的努力都是为了这一刻。在他面前的20英尺处，坐着黑暗的种子--世界上所有邪恶和疯狂的唯一的、不可弥补的来源--以及他唯一的、燃烧的问题的答案。",

	"The Gods had failed to give him answers. The Devils cared not for the secrets they held right within their grasp.

An answer hidden away so deep that even the Gods Feared to ask.": "诸神没能给他答案。魔鬼们不关心他们掌握的秘密。但现在，随着阿斯莫德的离开，他终于可以揭开有史以来最重要的一个问题的答案。这个答案隐藏得如此之深，甚至连众神都不敢问。",
	"Carefully, He stepped forward, fingers outstretched, blood from the fallen bishop dripping from his claws. The rune circle glowed. He felt the strength flee from himself and his comrades. They knew not the importance of this moment - knew not the true purpose of this ritual, the true reason he had gathered them together. Reaching upwards, he spoke the words he had memorized a thousand times over, reciting them with untold precision. And then.... The Black Deamon stepped from her place. The circle broken, the ritual descended into chaos. The Darkness Was unbound The Seed Unleashed! And as it consumed his fool of a companion, he cursed aloud in such words as should never been uttered in this world or the next! She had Ruined it! Destroyed the one chance he would ever have at an answer! She had Broken the Circle, , and now, the entire world would suffer for her transgression.": "他小心翼翼地走上前去，伸出手指，倒下的主教的血从他的爪子上滴落下来。符文圈发亮了。他感到力量从他自己和他的战友们身上消失了。他们不知道这一刻的重要性--不知道这个仪式的真正目的，不知道他把他们聚在一起的真正原因。他向上伸手，说出了他已经背了一千遍的话语，以难以计数的精确度背诵着它们。然后.... 黑魔王从她的位置上走了下来。圆圈被打破，仪式陷入了混乱。黑暗被解除了束缚，种子被释放了出来。 她毁了它! 毁掉了他唯一能得到答案的机会! 她破坏了这个圈子，而现在，整个世界都将为她的违法行为而受苦。",
	"Aeramanu are an old people, and for most of their history, have been among the lost and forgotten of peoples. Before The Fall, Aeramanu caravans travelled back and forth across Aetheros, offering exotic wares and occult insights to those willing to trade, and never staying in one place for more than a few nights.": "Aeramanu是一个古老的民族，在他们大部分的历史中，都是属于迷失和被遗忘的民族。在堕落之前，Aeramanu商队在Aetheros来回旅行，向那些愿意交易的人提供异国的商品和神秘的见解，并且从不在一个地方停留超过几晚。",
	"Their strong cultural connection to death and the occult labelled them as unclean, And outside of a few exceptions, Aeramanu were treated as little more than thieves, murderers, and assassins - a sentiment that many found easier to embrace than argue.": "他们与死亡和神秘主义的强烈文化联系给他们贴上了不洁的标签，除了少数例外，Aeramanu被视为小偷、杀人犯和刺客而已--许多人发现这种看法更容易接受而不是争论。",
	"It was not until after the fall, when an Aeramanu by the name of Victor Stein rose to power over what had once been the nine hells, that the Aeramanu people began to acquire wealth and social standing. Today, the three great Aeramanu houses are some of the wealthiest families in the world, Patronizing the Arts, Sciences, and Occult, but never forgetting the ashes from which they climbed.": "直到堕落之后，一位名叫维克多-斯坦恩的爱拉曼努人在曾经的九层地狱中崛起，爱拉曼努人才开始获得财富和社会地位。今天，三大Aeramanu家族是世界上最富有的家族之一，他们赞助艺术、科学和神秘学，但从未忘记他们从那里爬出来的灰烬。",

	"A great honour for the occult and a particularly grim aesthetic permeate modern Aeramanu Culture, and to dishonour the spirits or the family is seen as a punishable sin. Aeramanu are slow to trust, and often hold secrets like currency, coveting arcane knowledge above all others. The occult is born into their very blood, and an Aeramanu without magic is like a bird without feathers - already dead and worth only the meat on it's bones.": "现代Aeramanu文化中弥漫着对神秘学的巨大荣誉和特别严峻的审美，对神灵或家族的不敬被视为应受惩罚的罪行。爱拉曼努人对信任很迟钝，经常像持有货币一样持有秘密，对奥术知识的觊觎高于一切。神秘学诞生于他们的血液中，没有魔法的爱拉曼努人就像一只没有羽毛的鸟--已经死了，只剩下骨头上的肉。",
	"Aeramanu are a Proud People, both of their ancient traditions, and of their recent rise to power, and no Aeramanu will pass up the chance to recount wealth and accomplishments of their House. Modern Aeramanu dress in fine clothes which mimic the traditional wrappings of their nomadic ancestors, and often decorate themselves with colourful dyes or bright feathers in homage to Lord Victor Stein, who earned them their place within noble society.": "爱拉曼努人是一个骄傲的民族，无论是他们古老的传统，还是他们最近崛起的力量，没有一个爱拉曼努人会放弃讲述他们家族财富和成就的机会。现代Aeramanu人穿着精美的衣服，模仿他们游牧民族祖先的传统包裹，并经常用五颜六色的染料或鲜艳的羽毛装饰自己，向Victor Stein勋爵致敬，是他为他们在贵族社会赢得了地位。",
	"Because of this Great Pride, other races often see Aeramanu as elitist or presumptuous, And indeed many Aeramanu hardly consider other races worth their time.": "由于这种巨大的自豪感，其他种族往往认为爱拉曼努人是精英或自以为是，事实上许多爱拉曼努人几乎不认为其他种族值得他们花时间。",
	"But this does not describe the race as a whole, and all things told, Aeramanu are a driven and dedicated people, eager to make a name within a world that has only just begun to recognize their potential as anything more than thieves and charlatans, and their preoccupation with titles and social standing is the result of centuries spent deprived of any sense of worth among other races.": "但这并不能说明整个种族的情况，总的来说，Aeramanu是一个充满动力和奉献精神的民族，他们渴望在这个世界上扬名立万，而这个世界才刚刚开始认识到他们作为盗贼和骗子之外的潜力，他们对头衔和社会地位的专注是几个世纪以来在其他种族中被剥夺任何价值感的结果。",

	"​Your Intelligence score increases by 3, and your strength score decreases by 2.": "你的智力得分增加3分，力量得分减少2分。",
	"Auroros have a different concept of age than most species, as their ever shifting vapours are never entirely the same from moment to moment. That said, an individual cloud can exist for as long as it's psionic bonds hold, and unless these bonds are destroyed, an Auroros may be said to \"live\" indefinitely, or until it's diffusion with another cloud gives it new identity.": "Auroros对年龄的概念与大多数物种不同，因为它们不断变化的蒸气在每一刻都不完全相同。也就是说，只要它的幻觉纽带还在，一个单独的云就可以存在，除非这些纽带被破坏，否则可以说Auroros是无限期地 \"活着\"，或者直到它与另一个云的扩散赋予它新的身份。",
	"Most Auroros are chaotic at heart, a reflection of their ever swirling forms, but good and evil have little meaning to the Auroros as a whole. All things tend toward entropy.": "大多数Auroros的内心是混乱的，这是他们不断旋转的形式的反映，但善与恶对Auroros整体来说没有什么意义。所有事物都倾向于熵。",

	"Your gaseous body struggles to maintain cohesion without the aid of a pressurized suit. Your hit point maximum is reduced by half.": "你的气态身体在没有加压服的帮助下，很难维持凝聚力。你的最大命中率降低了一半。",
	"To protect your vaporous body and allow you to physically interact with the world, you are contained within a pressurized suit called a Xexel, which offers you a protective layer of Xexel hit points equal to your hit point maximum. These hit points function temporary hit points but do not prevent you from gaining additional temporary hit points from other sources.": "为了保护你虚无的身体，使你能够与世界进行物理互动，你被装在一件叫做Xexel的加压服里，它为你提供了一层Xexel命中率的保护，相当于你的最大命中率。这些命中率具有临时命中率的功能，但并不妨碍你从其他来源获得额外的临时命中率。",
	"Your Xexel is a complex piece of alien technology, and must be repaired as it takes damage. Your Xexel can only be repaired by yourself or another member of the Auroros race, and recovers hit points equal to 1 hit dice + your intelligence modifier for each hour spent undergoing repair.": "你的Xexel是一件复杂的外星技术，当它受到损害时必须进行修复。你的Xexel只能由你自己或另一个Auroros种族的成员来修理，并且每花一小时的时间来修理，就能恢复相当于1个命中率+你的智力修饰的命中率。",
	"Your separation form the world of the arcane makes it difficult to comprehend arcane magics. You are incapable of attuning to magic items, and require twice as long to copy new spells into a spell book or ritual book.": "你与奥术世界的分离使你难以理解奥术魔法。你无法适应魔法物品，并且需要两倍的时间将新的法术复制到法术书或仪式书中。",
	"Auroros have evolved a level of innate psionic ability, which allows them to interact with more solid objects even in their gaseous state. You can use and interact with objects and creatures within 10 ft of yourself as if you were touching them. You can carry and manipulate objects in this way up to a total combined weight (in pounds) equal to your intelligence modifier times 15. Interactions such as attack rolls and grapple checks made using this ability use your intelligence score in place of your strength score. Maintaining this telekinetic force requires concentration. If an action or effect would cause you to lose concentration on this ability, all force exerted by this ability ends, and objects or creatures held in the air by this ability drop to the ground.": "Auroros已经进化出了一定程度的先天幻象能力，这使得他们即使在气态下也能与更多的固体物体互动。你可以使用并与你周围10英尺内的物体和生物互动，就像你触摸它们一样。你可以用这种方式携带和操纵物体，其总重量（以磅为单位）等于你的智力修正值乘以15。使用这种能力进行的互动，如攻击卷和抓取检查，会使用你的智力分数来代替你的力量分数。保持这种心灵感应的力量需要集中精力。如果一个动作或效果会导致你失去对这个能力的注意力，那么这个能力所施加的所有力量都会结束，而被这个能力托在空中的物体或生物会掉到地上。",
	"You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.": "你可以对你周围60英尺内任何你能看到的生物进行心灵感应。你不需要与该生物共享一种语言，它就能理解你的心灵感应信息，但该生物必须能够理解至少一种语言，或者本身具有心灵感应能力。",
	"Magical methods of repair such as the Mending cantrip can be used to help restore a Xexel to proper working order, but due to the complex, alien nature of a the suit's design, only Auroros themselves, or creatures similarly familliar with Auroros technology are capable of using magic to repair a Xexel. For each foot of material repaired through spellwork, a Xexel recovers hit points as if it had spent an hour undergoing repairs. A Xexel can be repaired this way a number of times equal to the caster's proficiency bonus before requiring manual repairs. Multiple casters do not increase this limit.": "神奇的修复方法，例如修补术，可以用来帮助Xexel恢复到正常的工作状态，但是由于衣服设计的复杂性和异形性，只有Auroros本身，或者类似于熟悉Auroros技术的生物能够使用魔法来修复Xexel。通过魔法工作每修复一英尺的材料，Xexel就会恢复命中率，就像它花了一个小时进行修理一样。在需要人工修理之前，Xexel可以通过这种方式修理的次数与施法者的熟练度加成相等。多个施法者不会增加这个限制。",
	"Common, and your choice of two others.": "普通的，还有你选择的另外两个。",
	"Young Pythia Stepped into the ancient temple chamber, Alone. The guards stood to either side, just outside the door, fearful even to look in upon her ministrations. She was glad.": "年轻的皮提亚独自走进古老的神庙大厅。卫兵们站在门外的两边，甚至不敢看她的服务。她很高兴。",
	"It was not often that an Oracle could find peace within the world of men. Every merchant wished to know the outcome of his fortune, every warrior the tide of their next battle, and every king the fate of their heir and kingdom. She was accosted everywhere she went.": "在人的世界里，神谕者很少能找到平静。每个商人都想知道他的财富结果，每个战士都想知道他们下一场战斗的潮水，每个国王都想知道他们的继承人和王国的命运。她走到哪里都会被人搭讪。",
	"Everywhere but this place.": "到处都是，除了这个地方。",
	"She sat astride the chasm from which the glowing vapours swirled, seated firmly, but comfortably upon the cushions as she began to inhale. Almost immediately the strange voices and symbols began to fill her mind.": "她坐在那条鸿沟上，发光的蒸汽从那里涌出，她稳稳地坐在垫子上，但很舒服，她开始吸气。几乎就在这时，奇怪的声音和符号开始充斥她的头脑。",
	"War, chaos, the fall of great kings and the rise of strange empires flooded her vision. The dead walked among the living and strange golden men served humbly before creatures who's wealth could only belong to gods. She was used to this, it was her part to play as the great oracle of Delphi. But amongst the visions there was something else today. Something beyond the answers to the never ending questions laid out before her. Today the visions seemed almost to be asking something of her.": "战争、混乱、伟大国王的陨落和奇怪帝国的崛起充斥着她的视野。死人在活人中行走，奇怪的金人在那些只属于神的财富面前谦卑地服侍。她已经习惯了这些，这是她作为德尔菲伟大神谕的角色。但在这些幻象中，今天还有别的东西。一些超越了摆在她面前的永无止境的问题的答案。今天，这些异象似乎在向她提出一些要求。",
	"She was tired, and the noxious fumes, for all their power, did little to ease her state. As she swayed forth over the iridescent vapours, she could almost here a voice, like a mother, or sister, calling out to her by name, offering it's care and concern. The visions softened, and the swirls of cloudlike color receded almost as if pulling away from her. There would be no more prophecy today, no matter what the men asked. And she was glad of it.": "她很疲惫，有毒的烟雾，尽管它们的力量很大，但对缓解她的状态作用不大。当她在五彩斑斓的蒸气上摇摆时，她几乎能听到一个声音，就像母亲或姐妹，在呼唤她的名字，提供它的关怀和照顾。幻象软化了，云状色彩的漩涡几乎退去，仿佛从她身边拉开。今天不会再有预言了，不管那些人要求什么。她为此感到高兴。",
	"As the young Teran slept quietly upon the altar plinth, an invisible wind brushed through her untamed locks.": "当年轻的泰兰静静地睡在祭坛基座上时，一股无形的风拂过她桀骜的发丝。",
	"The girl was overworking herself again: trying so hard to provide for those men outside. At least here, Asara admitted, the youngling could rest undisturbed, she only wished the primitive minds of her unwitting hosts were more open to understanding her psychic warnings. Even stranded here without her Xexel, it pained her to see these Teran creatures at such constant odds with their own kind.": "这个女孩又开始过度劳累了：如此努力的为外面的那些人提供服务。阿萨拉承认，至少在这里，小姑娘可以不受干扰地休息，她只希望她那些不知情的主人的原始思想能更开放地理解她的精神警告。即使在没有她的Xexel的情况下被困在这里，看到这些泰兰生物与自己的同类如此不断地发生冲突，她也感到痛苦。",
	"To the outside observer, an Auroros in it's natural state may not seem alive at all. Indeed, among those of other worlds, these glowing clouds of swirling gas are often mistaken for nothing more than mirage-like illusions or atmospheric phenomenon; a disguise that the Auroros as a whole are happy to take advantage of.": "对于外部观察者来说，自然状态下的极光体可能根本就没有生命。事实上，在其他世界的人中，这些发光的气体漩涡云常常被误认为是海市蜃楼般的幻觉或大气现象；极光体作为一个整体很乐意利用这种伪装。",
	"Auroros make use of their unique biology to act as passive observers and watchers of other races. Few would suspect the air itself to be listening in on a private conversation, and the gentle curiosity of their race lead more than a few individuals along the path to discover secrets most would prefer hidden.": "Auroros利用他们独特的生物学特性，充当其他种族的被动观察者和监视者。很少有人会怀疑空气本身在偷听私人谈话，而他们种族温和的好奇心导致了更多的人在发现大多数人希望隐藏的秘密的道路上。",
	"This secret and intimate knowledge, however, is rarely used to any effect beyond satiating curiosity. Most Auroros prefer to stay out of the affairs of other races, and beyond observing, few individuals have much interest in directly interacting with more terrestrial races. As such, Auroros adventurers are rare. But rare seldom means unheard of.": "然而，这种秘密和私密的知识，除了满足好奇心之外，很少被用于任何效果。大多数Auroros人喜欢不参与其他种族的事务，除了观察之外，很少有人有兴趣直接与更多的陆地种族互动。因此，Auroros的冒险家很罕见。但罕见并不意味着闻所未闻。",
	"While shapes and forms may vary, most sentient life in the universe shares at least one thing in common: a physical body made up of solid matter. Auroros, however prove an exception to this rule. At home on Gaseous worlds devoid of solid matter, Auroros are a strange people made up entirely of shifting gasses and vapours, coalesced by psionic force. Their vaporous bodies faintly glow with a myriad of colors, giving them an ephemeral apperance not dissimilar to the polar lights sometimes known to dance through the nighttime skies.": "虽然形状和形式可能有所不同，但宇宙中大多数有生命的生物至少有一个共同点：一个由固体物质组成的身体。然而，Auroros被证明是这一规则的例外。在没有固体物质的气态世界中，Auroros是一个奇怪的民族，完全由变化的气体和蒸汽组成，由幻觉力量凝聚而成。他们蒸腾的身体微弱地闪耀着无数的颜色，给他们一个短暂的外观，与有时已知的在夜间天空中跳舞的极地之光不相上下。",
	"To the untrained eye, Auroros can often appear to be nothing more than strangely glowing clouds, and their natural bodies are incapable of exerting enough pressure to interact with solid objects or creatures, which puts them at a heavy physical disadvantage to other races. But what Auroros lack in solid substance, they make up for with powerful minds.": "在未经训练的人眼里，Auroros常常看起来不过是奇怪的发光云，他们的自然身体无法施加足够的压力与固体物体或生物互动，这使他们在身体上比其他种族处于严重的劣势。但是，Auroros在固体物质方面的不足，他们用强大的思想来弥补。",
	"These Living clouds are known as highly intelligent creatures, and their centuries old wisdom is valued in any number of important circles. Far beyond that, evolution has also gifted the Auroros with potent psionic abilities, such as telepathy and telekineses, allowing members of the race to communicate with others and manipulate the world around them through thought alone.": "这些 \"活云 \"是众所周知的高智商生物，他们几个世纪以来的智慧在任何重要的圈子里都受到重视。不仅如此，进化还赋予了奥罗罗人强大的幻觉能力，如心灵感应和心灵感应，使该种族的成员能够与他人沟通，仅通过思想就能操纵他们周围的世界。",
	"That said, these ephemeral dancing lights are not without more traditional ways of interacting with the world, and their advanced technology is, for most races, indistinguishable from magic.": "也就是说，这些短暂的舞动之光并非没有与世界互动的更传统的方式，对大多数种族来说，他们的先进技术与魔法没有什么区别。",
	"Long ago stripped of their own world, Auroros are an advanced people who have been travelling amongst the stars for millions of years. In this time they have adapted to the solid worlds of others through the use of specialized pressure-vessels that mimic the humanoid forms of other races. Over the countless centuries, these suits, known as Xexels, have become as intrinsic a part of the Auroros as their own gaseous bodies.": "很久以前，Auroros被剥夺了自己的世界，他们是一个先进的民族，已经在星空中旅行了数百万年。在这段时间里，他们通过使用模仿其他种族的人形的特殊压力容器，适应了其他国家的固体世界。在无数个世纪中，这些被称为Xexels的衣服已经成为奥罗罗人的内在组成部分，就像他们自己的气态身体一样。",
	"While inhabiting a Xexel, an Auroros is said to be \"Ccontained\", and can interact with the physical world in a similar way to any other humanoid. Xexels, however, are sophisticated devices which do far more than simply contain an individual's gaseous body. Each Xexel bears a powerful psionic link to it's owner, allowing them to experience the physical sensations like touch, which other creatures take for granted.": "当居住在Xexel中时，Auroros被称为 \"Ccontained\"，并能以类似于其他类人的方式与物理世界互动。然而，Xexel是一种复杂的设备，其作用远远超过了简单地容纳一个人的气态身体。每个Xexel都与它的主人有着强大的灵媒联系，使他们能够体验到其他生物认为理所当然的物理感觉，如触摸。",
	"Xexels are an intrinsic part of Auroros culture, and an individual's suit is as much a part of their identity as their memories and personality. Xexels are often decorated with intricate designs and patterns which tell the story of an individual's centuries-long life. While it is possible to exit a Xexel and float free in gaseous form, an Auroros would sooner die than leave their Xexel behind to be stolen or (gods forbid) worn by another creature. Stealing another's Xexel, or inhabiting a Xexel other than one's own, is seen as the greatest taboo of Auroros culture.": "Xexels是Auroros文化的内在组成部分，一个人的西装和他们的记忆和个性一样，都是他们身份的一部分。Xexels通常装饰着复杂的设计和图案，讲述着一个人几个世纪以来的生活故事。虽然有可能离开Xexel并以气态形式自由漂浮，但Auroros宁愿死也不愿意让他们的Xexel被偷走或（上帝保佑）被其他生物穿走。偷窃他人的Xexel，或居住在自己的Xexel之外，被视为Auroros文化的最大禁忌。",
	"Auroros are long-lived and highly cerebral creatures, and an individual's sense of identity might change hundreds of times over the course of it's eons-long life-span, but these changes do not alter the fundamental makeup of an Auroros. By contrast, the process of Psionic fission represents the birth of an entirely new creature.": "极光兽是长寿的、高度大脑化的生物，一个人的身份感在其漫长的生命过程中可能会改变数百次，但这些改变并不改变极光兽的基本构成。相比之下，幻术裂变的过程代表了一种全新的生物的诞生。",
	"During Psionic Fission, a single Auroros makes the conscious decision to become two: separating the distinct elements of their personality and self, along with the physical compounds that make up their body into two unique clouds. These clouds are both chemically and psionically distinct from their parent, and while they each retain aspects of their predecessor, they are separate individuals who often take close to a century to form a complete identity of their own.": "在Psionic Fission过程中，一个Auroros有意识地决定变成两个：把他们的个性和自我的不同元素，以及构成他们身体的物理化合物分离成两个独特的云团。这些云在化学上和幻觉上都与他们的母体不同，虽然他们都保留了他们前任的某些方面，但他们是独立的个体，往往需要接近一个世纪才能形成他们自己的完整身份。",
	"Psionic fission represents the end of an Auroros' singular life, and because of this it is an act seldom undergone without deep and meaningful consideration.": "幻象裂变代表着一个Auroros的奇异生命的结束，正因为如此，它是一个很少在没有深刻和有意义的考虑下进行的行为。",
	"Additionally, it can take an Auroros tens of decades to gather the necessary matter and psionic energy to successfully split into two unique beings, making the process as a whole quote rare.": "此外，一个Auroros可能需要花上几十年的时间来收集必要的物质和幻觉能量，以成功地分裂成两个独特的生命，这使得整个过程非常罕见。",
	"Auroros are always in a unique state of flux, and may choose to take many names and titles over their vast life-spans. Generally though, an Auroros will hold a single name for as long as it continues to interact with the same creatures. Auroros have no concept of gender or sexuality.": "Auroros总是处于一种独特的变化状态，在其漫长的生命历程中可能会选择使用许多名字和头衔。但一般来说，只要它继续与相同的生物互动，Auroros就会持有一个名字。Auroros没有性别或性行为的概念。",
	"Athphae, Atmos, Faera, Delphai, Ephervell, Ghora, Heiro, Nahlra, Pheos, Sephonea, Zeirhas": "Athphae, Atmos, Faera, Delphai, Ephervell, Ghora, Heiro, Nahlra, Pheos, Sephonea, Zeirhas",
	"The safety of your pressurised suit protects your gaseous body from direct harm, but there are a number of conditions which can expose your vaporous form to the outside air.": "你的加压服的安全保护你的气态身体不受直接伤害，但有一些情况会使你的气态暴露在外界空气中。",
	"A mechanical construct with a mind made of whirring gears and cogs, as a Babbage, you gain the following traits": "作为巴贝奇的机械构造，你的思维是由旋转的齿轮和齿轮组成的，你获得以下特征",
	"​Your Constitution score increases by 2.": "你的体质得分增加2。",
	"Babbage have no organic components, and as such can remain functional indefinitely if properly maintained.": "巴贝奇没有有机成分，因此，如果维护得当，可以无限期地保持功能。",

	"Your base walking speed is 30 feet.": "你的基本行走速度是30英尺。",
	"Your body is made entirely of metal and other durable components, making you far less fragile than other creatures. You are immune to the poison, sleep, paralysis, charm, fear, disease, and exhaustion effects and conditions. You are also immune to poison, and necrotic damage and have resistance to psychic damage.

	"While your mechanical components are not subject to the same frailties that plague organic creatures, you also do not have the benefit of natural healing and cannot regain hit points except by undergoing repairs.

	"Babbage are not living creatures. At least not in the traditional sense. While many scholars - and some Babbage - debate the true nature of a Babbage's intelligence, their fundamental makeup is nothing more than a series of complex mechanical movements.

	"Babbage do not age in the same way as other races - in a certain sense, they do not age at all. If well maintained and cared for, a Babbage will never show any true signs of the progression of time - They are functionally immortal. However, at the same time, spells such as raise-dead and resurrection do not work on a Babbage. Their existence is entirely man-made, and while a Babbage's recorded memories can be transplanted from body to body, this does not always ensure that the new machine will behave in the same ways as the original. Thus a Babbage attains a sort of immortality, but the question remains if they were ever truly alive.": "巴贝奇的衰老方式与其他种族不同--从某种意义上说，他们根本就不衰老。如果维护和保养得好，巴贝奇永远不会显示出任何真正的时间进展的迹象--他们在功能上是不朽的。然而，与此同时，诸如 \"死而复生 \"和 \"复活 \"的法术对巴贝奇不起作用。他们的存在完全是人为的，虽然巴贝奇记录的记忆可以从一个身体移植到另一个身体，但这并不总是确保新机器的行为与原来的相同。因此，巴贝奇获得了某种不朽的地位，但问题是他们是否曾经真正活着。",
	"Charles Babbage's original designs are held in copyright by Babbage himself, who strictly controls the reproduction of his work. However that has not prevented other engineers from creating their own designs inspired by his work, and the term \"Babbage\" has quickly come to refer to any intelligent construct. The function and appearance of these constructs can vary wildly from manufacturer to manufacturer. The most exquisite and sought after models are produced by Charles Babbbage and assembled by hand to function as ornately decorated household servants, while more industrial models produced by companies such as Aethertech Inc. are more bare-bones and designed for functional efficiency over physical beauty. Some models sport specialized tools or equipment such as additional arms or spider-like sub-chassis to better support their weight, but those most likely to be found adventuring are almost exclusively humanoid and sport a modular design that allows them to take advantage of new advancements in parts and upgrade their existing bodies with aftermarket accessories.": "查尔斯-巴贝奇的原始设计由巴贝奇本人拥有版权，他严格控制对其作品的复制。然而，这并不妨碍其他工程师在他的作品的启发下创造自己的设计，\"巴贝奇 \"一词很快就被用来指代任何智能构造。这些构造物的功能和外观可能因制造商的不同而大相径庭。最精致和最受欢迎的模型是由查尔斯-巴贝奇生产的，并由手工组装，作为装饰华丽的家庭仆人，而由Aethertech公司等公司生产的更多的工业模型则更加赤裸裸，设计的功能效率高于物理美。一些模型采用专门的工具或设备，如额外的手臂或蜘蛛状的副底盘，以更好地支持他们的重量，但那些最有可能被发现的冒险者几乎都是人形，并采用模块化设计，使他们能够利用新的零部件的进步，用售后配件升级他们现有的身体。",
	"Babbage were originally introduced to the world as mechanical servants and workers, and to many, they still are. Despite their intelligence, there are many who find it difficult to see Babbage as anything more than expensive machines or tools. And there are plenty of Babbage who are perfectly happy with this arrangement. Those Babbage who have either emaciated themselves through their own efforts, or been otherwise abandoned or forgotten, often seek to expand their horizons by exploring jobs and tasks other than what they were designed for. In many cases this can lead them to the life of an adventurer.": "巴贝奇最初是作为机械仆人和工人被介绍给世界的，对许多人来说，它们仍然是。尽管它们很聪明，但有很多人觉得很难把巴贝奇看作是昂贵的机器或工具。而有很多巴贝奇对这种安排非常满意。那些因为自己的努力而变得憔悴的巴贝奇，或者被遗弃或遗忘的巴贝奇，常常通过探索他们设计以外的工作和任务来扩大他们的视野。在许多情况下，这可以使他们过上冒险家的生活。",

For each foot of material repaired through spellwork, a Babbage recovers hit points as if they had spent an hour undergoing repairs. A Babbage can be repaired this way a number of times equal to the caster's proficiency bonus before requiring manual repairs. Multiple casters do not increase this limit.": "神奇的修复方法，如修补术，可以用来帮助恢复巴贝奇的状态，而不需要使用工匠的工具或拆除他们的装甲，但由于巴贝奇设计的复杂性，大多数法师都无法完全修复巴贝奇。通过法术修复的每一英尺的材料，巴贝奇都会恢复命中率，就像他们花了一个小时的时间进行修理一样。在需要人工修理之前，一个巴贝奇可以通过这种方式修理的次数与施法者的熟练度加成相等。多个施法者不会增加这个限制。",

	"There is some debate over the original purpose for which Chakara were created - a secret that the Glowing People seem to have no interest in sharing, if they know at all. Many Scholars still the idea that Chakara were originally created as a type of unseen servant, in a similar way that many eastern cultures have crafted constructs such as golems or babbages, but new archeological discoveries suggest that this may not be the case. Ancient scrolls and writings discovered in what may be the ruins of the Chakara birthplace discuss a rite by which powerful mystics would expel the impure portions of their soul, binding them into physical form so that they could not return. Still beyond that, local legends in the area speak of a temple of enlightenment, where monks would transcend their mortal coils, only to return down the mountain as beings of pure light.": "对于创造Chakara的最初目的有一些争论--如果发光人知道的话，他们似乎对分享这个秘密没有兴趣。许多学者仍然认为，Chakara最初是作为一种看不见的仆人被创造出来的，就像许多东方文化中的构造物一样，如golems或babbages，但新的考古发现表明，情况可能并非如此。在可能是查卡拉出生地的废墟中发现的古代卷轴和文字讨论了一种仪式，强大的神秘主义者会通过这种仪式驱逐他们灵魂中不纯的部分，将它们束缚在物理形态中，使它们无法返回。除此之外，该地区的当地传说还提到了一座启蒙寺庙，在那里，僧侣们会超越凡人的束缚，只在下山时成为纯洁的光的存在。",
	"Whatever the reason for their creation may be, there seems to be some agreement on the method of their birth. The first Chakara were seemingly born through the deep meditations of ancient psions, and bound to this world only by their creator's will, lasted only so long as their master's meditation. With time, the ancient monks learned to extend this fleeting existence; Using seals empowered through forgotten eastern magics, they bound their astral constructs permanently to the material plane, giving them a solid, humanoid form. Every Chakara in existence today was born through this method, in times now forgotten, as the specific techniques of their creation seem to have been lost to even the Chakara themselves": "不管他们被创造的原因是什么，对于他们的诞生方法似乎有一些共识。第一批查卡拉似乎是通过古代幻术师的深层冥想而诞生的，并且只被他们的创造者的意志束缚在这个世界上，只持续到他们主人的冥想为止。随着时间的推移，古代僧侣们学会了延长这种短暂的存在；他们使用通过被遗忘的东方魔法赋予的封印，将他们的星体构造永久地束缚在物质界，给他们一个坚实的、人形的形式。今天存在的每一个查卡拉都是通过这种方法诞生的，在现在被遗忘的时代，因为他们创造的具体技术似乎连查卡拉自己都已经失去了。",
	"The Chakara are a strange People, even within the diverse and multiplicative races of Aetheros. Physical beings only in the strictest sense, Chakara are manifestations of pure psionic energy, held together in humanoid form by a collection of magical seals which bind their astral bodies. From a distance, one might mistake a Chakara for some sort of strange glowing mummy, if not for the almost ethereal grace in the way they move, or the way their shimmering forms never quite seem to touch the ground. This ephervescent light has earned the Chakara a name amongst other races: \"The Glowing People\", and it is a name that they live up to in more ways than one": "Chakara是一个奇怪的民族，即使是在Aetheros的多样化和多种族中。从最严格的意义上讲，Chakara是纯粹的幻觉能量的表现，通过一系列的魔法封印将他们的星体结合在一起，形成人形。从远处看，人们可能会误以为查卡拉是某种奇怪的发光木乃伊，如果不是因为他们移动的方式几乎是空灵的优雅，或者他们闪烁的形式似乎从未完全接触到地面。这种闪烁的光芒为查卡拉人在其他种族中赢得了一个名字。\"发光的人\"，他们在很多方面都不辜负这个名字。",

	"Some Chakara take these Lotus States to represent different versions of the same self, but others consider each state in which they may reside as a different person entirely, with it's own unique name.

	"Whatever mutation the disease causes within the brain and body, it seems that those afflicted do not require rest in the same way as normal humans. You do not require sleep, so long as you have received a transfusion of at least 1 pint of blood in the past 24 hours.": "无论这种疾病在大脑和身体内引起何种变异，似乎受影响的人不像正常人那样需要休息。你不需要睡眠，只要你在过去24小时内接受了至少1品脱血液的输注。",

	"Lady Rosaline Byron stood over her microscope frowning. Yet again, her attempts to isolate the Umbravirales-Sanguinem pathogen from her own infected blood had proved to be a failure. It was beginning to seem as if Adam Virus had specifically designed his shadow plague to make the host dependant on the infection. Any attempt to remove the virus had so far only resulted in rapid decay and cell death. Alas, the Cure for Vampirism eluded her another day.": "罗莎琳-拜伦夫人站在她的显微镜前，皱着眉头。然而，她试图从自己被感染的血液中分离出Umbravirales-Sanguinem病原体的努力再次被证明是失败的。开始看起来好像亚当病毒专门设计了他的影子瘟疫，使宿主依赖感染。到目前为止，任何清除病毒的尝试都只导致了快速的腐烂和细胞死亡。唉，吸血鬼的治疗方法又让她无从下手了。",
	"She packed up her microscope and other lab equipment, and stepped out the door into the rainforest. Behind her, the small lab quickly folded itself back up into a pocketsized cube, which she placed inside her pack. The others had already all but finished striking camp.": "她收拾好她的显微镜和其他实验室设备，走出门进入雨林。在她身后，小实验室迅速地把自己折叠起来，变成一个袖珍的立方体，她把它放在她的背包里。其他人已经全部完成了对营地的打击。",
	"From across the clearing, A blue Dragonborn in particularly maid-like attire smiled over at her. \"Any new progress today madame?\" The girl called out \"Not today, Aluna, but soon! It's only a matter of time before I crack this. And with a more direct sample of the blight, research should be far more fruitful!\" She wasn't sure if she believed it herself, but at the very least it helped to keep one's chin up.": "从空地对面，一个穿着特别像女仆的蓝色龙裔向她微笑。\"今天有什么新进展吗，夫人？\" 女孩叫道：\"今天没有，阿鲁纳，但很快就有了！\"。我破解这个问题只是时间问题。有了更直接的枯萎病样本，研究应该会有更多的成果！\" 她不确定她自己是否相信这一点，但至少这有助于保持人的下巴。",
	"Legends of vampiric demons and bloodsucking monsters have been passed down through the mortal realm since almost the beginning of time. Parents have told their children tales of horrifying beasts or charismatic devils with supernatural powers and a thirst for the pulsing red lifeblood of living creatures. And in dark whispers, townsfolk speak of the fearful and sanguine appetites of the waking dead.": "几乎自古以来，关于吸血鬼恶魔和吸血怪物的传说就一直在凡人领域流传着。父母向他们的孩子讲述可怕的野兽或有魅力的魔鬼的故事，他们拥有超自然的力量，并渴求活物的红色脉动血液。在黑暗的低语中，乡亲们谈论着醒着的死人的可怕和饥渴的胃口。",
	"In reality, true vampires , though they may share many traits with these legends and tales, bear little resemblance to the terrible monsters so commonly heard of in folklore. Simple men and women , set upon by a disastrous affliction, the modern Homo-Sanguinem is a more often a tragic figure, who's morbid reliance on the blood of others is no more a fault of their own than the colour of a man's skin, or the serendipity of his birth.": "在现实中，真正的吸血鬼，尽管他们可能与这些传说和故事有许多共同的特征，但与民间传说中经常听到的可怕怪物没有什么相似之处。现代吸血鬼是一个简单的男人和女人，被灾难性的折磨所困扰，他们往往是一个悲剧性的人物，他们对他人血液的病态依赖并不是他们自己的错，就像一个人的皮肤颜色或他出生的偶然性。",
	"It is unknown to what degree the Sanguinem variation of Umbravirales was originally designed to resemble the traditional tales of vampirism, or what end the Madman Adam Virus sought by releasing the Umbravirales plague upon the world, however the resulting mutations have by this point been well documented.": "目前还不知道Umbravirales的Sanguinem变体在多大程度上被设计为类似于传统的吸血鬼故事，也不知道疯子亚当病毒在世界范围内释放Umbravirales瘟疫是为了什么目的，然而由此产生的变异在这一点上已经有了充分的记录。",
	"The Sanguinem strain appears to exclusively afflict humans, with other strains of the Umbravirales causing separate mutations in other races. Early Symptoms most often manifest within the first 3 years of childhood, and include sunlight sensitivity, compounding anaemia, and rapid loss of natural pigmentation in the skin, eyes, and hair. As the disease progresses, syringelike fangs begin to develop within the subject's upper jaw, and hyperaggressive behaviour is common as severe anaemia gives way to reliance on regular blood transfusions.": "Sanguinem菌株似乎只影响人类，Umbravirales的其他菌株会在其他种族中引起单独的变异。早期症状最常在儿童期的前三年表现出来，包括对阳光敏感，复合性贫血，以及皮肤、眼睛和头发的天然色素迅速丧失。随着疾病的发展，受试者的上颚开始长出注射器般的獠牙，由于严重贫血而依赖定期输血，过度攻击行为很常见。",
	"Infected individuals who survive into adolescence often develop secondary traits, such as more increased muscle growth, cognitive hyperactivity, or other, less quantifiable symptoms. Of particular note, subjects who pass through adolescence, and are able to maintain a healthy and regular schedule of blood transfusion seem to show no signs of cell death or genetic atrophy. It is Theorized that perhaps this type of \"cellular immortally\" was the trait sought by Virus in his experiments.": "存活到青春期的感染者往往会发展出一些次要的特征，如更多的肌肉增长、认知上的过度活跃，或其他不太能量化的症状。特别值得注意的是，经过青春期的受试者，能够保持健康和定期输血的时间表，似乎没有显示出细胞死亡或基因萎缩的迹象。据推测，这种类型的 \"细胞不死 \"也许是维鲁斯在其实验中所追求的特征。",
	"Unlike vampires of legend, persons afflicted by HomoSanguinem are not inherently contagious, and while it is possible to artificially contract the disease through repeated transfusion of infected blood, cases of this are understandably rare, and most often result in violent and painful death due to system shock.": "与传说中的吸血鬼不同，受Homoanguinem影响的人本身并不具有传染性，虽然有可能通过反复输注受感染的血液而人为地感染这种疾病，但这种情况可以理解为很罕见，而且大多数情况下会因系统休克而导致暴力和痛苦的死亡。",
	"Those afflicted by the Sanguinem mutation are in most cases easy to recognize by the time they reach adulthood. A lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes results in marked albinism. In addition, the severe anaemia and reliance on regular blood transfusions often leaves subjects affected by the disease with a frail or gaunt appearance - an appearance that oddly enough is often deceptive in lieu of almost supernatural constitution.": "受桑吉纳姆突变影响的人，在大多数情况下，在他们成年时很容易被认出。皮肤、头发和眼睛缺乏色素，导致明显的白化病。此外，严重的贫血和对定期输血的依赖往往使受该病影响的人具有虚弱或憔悴的外表--奇怪的是，这种外表往往是骗人的，因为它几乎是超自然的体质。",
	"Most afflicted individuals continue the traditions of their human lineage, and bear no more outlandish names than any other human of their upbringing.": "大多数受折磨的人都延续了他们人类血统的传统，并且与他们成长过程中的其他人类相比，没有更多离奇的名字。",
	"Vampiric affliction manifests different in each victim, but always comes with an unnatural affinity for manipulating life-force through blood. While these feats are most prevalent in those affected by UmbraviralesSanguinem, they can also be gained by those unaffected by the vampire plague through extensive study of blood magic rites.": "吸血鬼的痛苦在每个受害者身上的表现都不同，但总是伴随着通过血液操纵生命力的非自然的亲和力。虽然这些能力在受UmbraviralesSanguinem影响的人身上最普遍，但未受吸血鬼瘟疫影响的人也可以通过广泛研究血魔法仪式获得这些能力。",

	"Myxapia large enough to present humanlike intelligence are medium creatures. While it is possible for a colony to grow larger, such colonies generally split into multiple smaller organisms.": "大到足以呈现人类智慧的无尾熊是中等生物。虽然一个群落有可能变大，但这种群落一般会分裂成多个较小的生物体。",
	"Myxapia do not have the benefit of bones or other skeletal structure to aid in their movement. Your base movement speed is 20ft.": "Myxapia没有骨头或其他骨骼结构的好处来帮助它们的运动。你的基本移动速度是20英尺。",

	"Your body is malleable, allowing you to squeeze through gaps too small for other living creatures. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and are immune to the grappled condition Equipment that would not fit though this gap is left behind.": "你的身体是可塑的，使你能够挤过对其他生物来说太小的缝隙。你可以在1英寸宽的狭窄空间中移动而不被挤压，并且对抓取的条件免疫 装备如果不能通过这个缝隙就会被留下。",
	"Every cell of your body has an intelligence of it's own, allowing you to survive damage that might kill other adventurers by splitting yourself into smaller slimes. As a reaction when you would be reduced to 0 hit points and still have at least one hit dice remaining, you may choose to split yourself into a number of tiny oozes equal to your remaining hit dice. Each of these oozes has a speed of 10ft, and hit points equal to one hit dice + your constitution modifier. These oozes cannot take any action other than a move action. At the end of a long rest, any remaining oozes merge together to reform your body.": "你身体的每一个细胞都有自己的智慧，使你能够通过将自己分裂成更小的粘液，在可能杀死其他冒险者的伤害中幸存下来。作为一种反应，当你的命中率降至0，但仍有至少一个命中率骰子剩余时，你可以选择将自己分裂成与你剩余的命中率骰子数量相等的微小黏液。每一个小虫子的速度为10英尺，命中率等于一个命中率+你的体质修正值。除了移动动作外，它们不能采取任何行动。在长时间的休息结束后，任何剩余的ozes都会融合在一起，重组你的身体。",
	"Your gelatinous body is far too soft to support most types of armor, but this plasmodic nature also makes you far more resilient against physical attacks. You cannot wear heavy or medium armor, but are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.": "你的胶状身体太过柔软，无法支撑大多数类型的盔甲，但这种塑化的性质也使你对物理攻击有更强的抵抗力。你不能穿戴重型或中型盔甲，但可以抵抗击打、穿刺和砍击伤害。",
	"Your slimelike body is prone to evaporation and freezing, and suffers under intense heat or cold. You are vulnerable to fire and cold damage as well as damage caused by spells or effects that drain moisture, and have disadvantage on Attack rolls and ability checks while in Arid or frozen environments.": "你纤细的身体很容易被蒸发和冻结，并在酷热或严寒下受到影响。你很容易受到火灾和寒冷的伤害，以及由消耗水分的法术或效果造成的伤害，并且在干旱或冰冻的环境中，在攻击卷和能力检查上有劣势。",

	"As they squeezed through the small crack beneath the stonework of the Library, Mim's gelatinous body frothed with nervous excitement. The Order had stockpiled more knowledge here than anywhere else across the empire, it was a shame it was door-locked away from the common folk of Languine.": "当他们挤过图书馆石板下的小缝隙时，米姆的胶状身体因紧张兴奋而发抖。骑士团在这里储存的知识比整个帝国的任何地方都要多，可惜它被门锁住了，不让朗格纳的普通人看到。",
	"Normally they weren't fond of using their abilities to get into places they weren't supposed to be, But somewhere among these vast halls and word-memories was the knowledge of how to defeat the Litch. If Mim was going to save the home-place, they had to be willing to break rules. And hiding word-memories seemed like a strange rule anyway. Humans seemed to have lots of those.": "通常他们不喜欢用他们的能力去进入他们不应该去的地方，但在这些巨大的大厅和文字记忆中的某个地方，有如何打败利奇的知识。如果米姆要拯救家园，他们必须愿意打破规则。无论如何，隐藏文字记忆似乎是一个奇怪的规则。人类似乎有很多这样的规则。",

	"Oozes were some of the earliest inhabitants of the material planes: little more than a mass of cells and digestive fluids, by some accounts they predate even the creations of the gods. However, not all slimes are as rudimentary as one might expect. Through untold millennia of evolution, or perhaps by exposure to some yet unknown magics, there are slimes who have become sentient, even sapient, and who's strange bodies are matched by intelligence stranger still.": "黏液是物质世界中最早的居民之一：根据一些说法，它们只不过是一团细胞和消化液，甚至比诸神的创造物还要早。然而，并不是所有的粘液都像人们想象的那样简陋。通过数千年的进化，或者说通过接触一些未知的魔法，有些史莱姆已经有了知觉，甚至有了智慧，他们奇怪的身体和奇怪的智慧相匹配。",
	"Myxapia are fundamentally unlike other sentient creatures. Where most living creatures might have bodies broken down into complex systems and specialized parts, Myxapia consist of an acellular mass of creeping jellylike protoplasm. Their bodies are unique in that any part of that protoplasm might perform any function at any time. Similar to the way a colony of ants might act as a single massive organism, An Individual Myxapia is more like a mass of amoeboid cells, each with a minute intelligence of it's own.": "Myxapia从根本上说不同于其他有生命的生物。大多数生物的身体可能被分解成复杂的系统和专门的部分，而Myxapia是由无细胞的蠕动果冻状原生质组成的。它们的身体是独特的，因为原生质体的任何部分都可以在任何时候执行任何功能。类似于一个蚂蚁群可能作为一个单一的大型生物体的方式，单个Myxapia更像是一团变形虫细胞，每一个都有它自己的微小智慧。",
	"The concept of individuality does not exist within Myxapia communities. While a single Myxapia may think and function independently, within the colony, knowledge and information are shared by way of a sort of tactile telepathy. Outside of the colony, Myxapia unerringly refer to themselves in the plural, even if they have adopted a unique name. Some researchers theorize that this is because each individual is itself a type of colony. Others posit that Myxapia still retain some minute connection to their colony, even at a distance.": "个人的概念在Myxapia社区内并不存在。虽然单个Myxapia可能会独立思考和运作，但在聚居地内，知识和信息是通过某种触觉心灵感应的方式共享的。在聚居地之外，Myxapia不约而同地用复数称呼自己，即使它们采用了一个独特的名字。一些研究人员推测，这是因为每个个体本身就是一种群落类型。另一些人认为，Myxapia仍然与它们的群体保持着某种细微的联系，即使在远处。",
	"Myxapia do not breed in the same way as other races.": "妙蛙鱼的繁殖方式与其他种族不一样。",
	"Instead when an \"adult\" has reached substantial size, they may choose to divide themselves into multiple smaller individuals. These smaller Myxapia share all the memories and experience of their former self, but lack the same humanoid intelligence, which will instead develop as they grow in size.

	"Immature Myxapia are more akin to animals in their intelligence, and primarily seek to feed on organic material so that they can grow. For this reason, Myxapia rarely reproduce outside of a colony, and if they do so, it is usually with the intention of forming a new colony in a carefully chosen location. When substantial nutrients are available, a Myxapia colony can expand from only a few members to upwards of a thousand in a very short time. This said, Myxapia are generally a peaceful folk, and have little interest in forming colonies in places that other sentient creatures call home.": "未成熟的Myxapia在智力上更类似于动物，主要寻求以有机物质为食，以便它们能够成长。出于这个原因，Myxapia很少在群落之外进行繁殖，如果它们这样做，通常是为了在一个精心选择的地点形成一个新的群落。当有大量的营养物质可用时，一个Myxapia群落可以在很短的时间内从只有几个成员扩大到超过一千人。这就是说，Myxapia通常是一个和平的民族，对在其他有生命的生物称之为家园的地方形成殖民地没有兴趣。",
	"Fully formed Myxapia generally resemble a humanoid made of semi-translucent slime. The color of this slime can vary anywhere between bright greens and blues, to dark greys and even blacks, although it seems to remain consistent among members of the same colony. Because their amorphous bodies have no defining internal structure, Myxapia can alter their physical shape on a whim. Some choose to resemble other humanoids they have met, such as elves or humans, while others prefer a less defined shape. It is not uncommon for Myxapia to Mimic the physical features of someone they are speaking to, leading to an eerie duplicity that many find unsettling. More often than not, Myxapia support themselves on a single flowing stalk, rather than two bipedal limbs, and move slowly across the ground in a similar motion to their more primal brethren.": "完全形成的Myxapia通常类似于一个由半透明粘液制成的人形。这种粘液的颜色可以在任何地方变化，从明亮的绿色和蓝色，到深灰色甚至黑色，尽管它在同一群体的成员中似乎保持一致。由于它们无定形的身体没有明确的内部结构，Myxapia可以随心所欲地改变它们的身体形状。有些人选择与他们遇到的其他人形生物相似，如精灵或人类，而其他人则喜欢不太明确的形状。Myxapia模仿与他们交谈的人的身体特征的情况并不少见，这导致了一种阴森的重复性，许多人觉得很不舒服。更常见的是，Myxapia用一根流动的茎来支撑自己，而不是用两个双足肢体，并以类似于它们更原始的兄弟的运动方式在地上缓慢移动。",

Rather, Qual'ath themselves are best described as worm or snake-like symbiotes - slithering squirming slugs that feed on the psionic energy of other creatures. If not for one particular evolution, in fact, the great Qual'ath empires could never have come to be.

	"As this mutualism grew, Qual'Ath tadpoles evolved the unique ability to mutate their host's body to better suit their combined needs. A mature pair, known as a Qual'Carrak, would become a force of reckoning, not just in terms of metal ability, but in terms of physical prowess as well. Never content as they were, however, the empires of the Qual'ath began to seek additional hosts, creatures more suited to the variety of strange worlds they came to inhabit. Today, Qual'Ath tadpoles are known to take host in any number of humanoid species. Connecting themselves through vast and expansive hive-minds, Qual'Ath colonies grow and adapt quickly, each individual benefitting from not only the knowledge and experience of their brethren, but also that of their hosts.": "随着这种相互关系的发展，Qual'Ath蝌蚪进化出了独特的能力，可以变异其宿主的身体，以更好地适应它们的综合需要。一对成熟的蝌蚪，被称为Qual'Carrak，将成为一股不可忽视的力量，不仅在金属能力方面，而且在体能方面也是如此。然而，Qual'ath帝国从未满足于此，他们开始寻求更多的宿主，即更适合于他们所居住的各种奇怪世界的生物。今天，Qual'Ath的蝌蚪被认为可以寄生在任何数量的类人物种中。通过巨大而广阔的蜂巢思维将自己连接起来，Qual'Ath殖民地迅速成长和适应，每个人不仅受益于他们兄弟的知识和经验，也受益于他们的主人。",
	"Qual'Ath colonies are generally overseen by what is known as an elder brain - a particularly powerful individual, who has grown beyond the constraints of it's host, and resides in a large spawning pool alongside immature tadpoles, the weakest of whom become meals for the elder brain. The spawning pool and elder brain are cared for by the entire colony as a whole, and after a year, mature tadpoles are implanted into their humanoid hosts in a ceremonial event known as \"the birthing\".": "Qual'Ath殖民地通常由所谓的 \"长者之脑 \"监管--一个特别强大的个体，它的成长已经超出了它的宿主的限制，并与未成熟的蝌蚪一起居住在一个大型产卵池中，其中最弱的蝌蚪成为长者之脑的食物。产卵池和长者之脑由整个族群整体照顾，一年后，成熟的蝌蚪被植入他们的人形宿主体内，这是一个被称为 \"分娩 \"的仪式事件。",
	"This ceremony lasts approximately a week, during which the host's body is permanently altered to better suit the need's of both creatures in a process known as ceremorphosis. When the ceremony is complete, host and tadpole have become inseperable, and it is only at this point that a Qual'Ath is considered truly \"born.\" Freshly \"born\" Qual'Ath are already mature adults by the standards of most other societies, having absorbed the appropriate knowledge of their world directly from the elder brain. They enter society immediately, taking roles however they are best suited. As dualistic organisms, Qual'ath grant a sort of immortality to their hosts: using their unique psionic abilities to correct the course of aging and stop normal cell death. Because of this, it is rare for a Qual'Ath to die except by extraordinary means, and when a death does occur, the entire colony mourns the loss together.": "这个仪式大约持续一周，在这个过程中，宿主的身体被永久地改变，以更好地适应两种生物的需要，这个过程被称为蜕变。当仪式完成时，宿主和蝌蚪已经变得密不可分，只有在这一点上，Qual'Ath才被认为是真正的 \"出生\"。按照大多数其他社会的标准，刚 \"出生 \"的Qual'Ath已经是成熟的成年人，他们直接从长者的大脑中吸收了有关他们世界的适当知识。他们立即进入社会，扮演他们最适合的角色。作为二元生物，Qual'ath赋予他们的宿主一种不朽的力量：用他们独特的幻觉能力来纠正衰老的过程，并阻止正常的细胞死亡。正因为如此，除非有特殊的手段，否则Qual'Ath很少会死亡，而当死亡发生时，整个群体会一起哀悼这一损失。",
	"After death, the brain of a Qual'Ath is placed within the spawning tank alongside the elder brain, where it's knowlege and personality may be absorbed by both the elder brain itself, and by the young maturing tadpoles.": "死后，Qual'Ath的大脑被放置在产卵池中，与长者的大脑放在一起，它的知识和个性可能被长者的大脑本身和正在成熟的小蝌蚪所吸收。",
	"This final act allows a Qua'Ath to continue it's existance in some meaningful way, even after death.": "这种最后的行为允许Qua'Ath以某种有意义的方式继续存在，甚至在死后。",
	"Contrary to most popular understanding, Not all Qual'Ath hosts are taken by force. In fact, for much of Qual'Ath society, the idea of taking an unwilling host was considered unthinkable. An unwilling host was sure to weaken and sabotage the Qual'Ath mind, sewing seeds of destruction and dissent within the entire colony.": "与大多数人的理解相反，并非所有的Qual'Ath宿主都是被强迫带走的。事实上，对于大部分Qual'Ath社会来说，带走一个不愿意的宿主的想法被认为是不可想象的。一个不情愿的宿主肯定会削弱和破坏Qual'Ath的思想，在整个殖民地内播下破坏和异议的种子。",
	"But at a point long forgotten, researchers on distant stars challenged this perception in every way. Starving their own tadpoles until the day of their \"birthing,\" this small group, known today as the Illithea, were able to coerce the infantile tadpoles into devouring the brains of unwilling hosts, supplanting the mind of the creature with their own. These Illithid proved to be incredibly powerful, with psionic abilities surpassing even some elder brains. The power came at a cost, of course: without a host brain to draw psionic nutrients from, the Illithid, or Mind Flayers as they have come to be known developed a violent dependance on consuming the brains of others.": "但在一个早已被遗忘的时刻，在遥远的星星上的研究人员从各个方面挑战了这种看法。饿着自己的蝌蚪，直到他们 \"出生 \"的那一天，这个小群体，今天被称为Illithea，能够胁迫幼年的蝌蚪吞噬不情愿的主人的大脑，用自己的大脑取代生物的大脑。这些Illithid被证明是令人难以置信的强大，其幻觉能力甚至超过了一些长者的大脑。当然，这种力量是有代价的：如果没有宿主的大脑来汲取幻觉的养分，Illithid，或者说Mind Flayers（他们已经被称为 \"心魔\"）就会对吞噬他人的大脑产生强烈的依赖性。",
	"Many Elders banded together against the spread of this practice, unnerved and disgusted by the abhorrent parasites it created, but finding willing new creatures to serve as hosts was difficult, and with the everexpanding number of tadpoles being spawned, the horrendous practice soon overtook more traditional values. Today, Illithid represent the largest faction of Qual'ath Societies, and the traditionalists who continue to refuse the practice - known as Thoc-Rah - have been forced into hiding within their own secretive colonies and enclaves. Here they attempt to preserve the ancient customs, under threat not only from their own Illithid brothers, but from outsiders who cannot tell difference between the cruel Illithid and their peacfull counterparts.": "许多长老联合起来反对这种做法的传播，他们对这种做法产生的可恶的寄生虫感到不安和厌恶，但要找到愿意作为宿主的新生物是很困难的，而且随着蝌蚪的数量不断扩大，这种可怕的做法很快就超越了更多的传统价值观。今天，Illithid代表了Qual'ath社会的最大派别，而那些继续拒绝这种做法的传统主义者--被称为Thoc-Rah--已经被迫躲进他们自己的秘密殖民地和飞地。在这里，他们试图保留古老的习俗，不仅受到自己的伊里特兄弟的威胁，也受到无法区分残酷的伊里特人和和平的同行的威胁。",
	"Qual'Ath appearance can vary vastly depending on the host, but their skin is smooth and completely hairless and ranges through a variety of cool colors. Qual'ath have a tall, sloping cranium, two roughly-humanoid eyes, and four long, coiling tendrils concealing an alien mouth evolved for feeding rather than communication.": "Qual'Ath的外观可以根据宿主的不同而有很大的不同，但他们的皮肤是光滑的，完全没有毛发，并有各种冷色。奎尔阿斯有一个高大、倾斜的头颅，两只粗糙的人形眼睛，以及四条长长的、盘绕的卷须，隐藏着一张为进食而非交流而进化的外星嘴。",
	"Qual'Ath have no concept of gender or sexuality, and their names are not so much a combination of sounds and syllables such as other creatures use, but rather a collection of thoughts and ideas that define them. And such names can change over time as an individual develops or explores new elements of themselves. Such names are called Thought names,and when spoken aloud, are accompanied by a sort of psychic static that attempts to approximate these sensations.": "Qual'Ath没有性别或性行为的概念，他们的名字不像其他生物那样是声音和音节的组合，而是定义他们的思想和观念的集合。这种名字可以随着时间的推移而改变，因为一个人在发展或探索自己的新元素。这样的名字被称为 \"思想的名字\"，当大声说出来时，伴随着一种精神上的静态，试图接近这些感觉。",

	"For the sake of interracting with other, lest psionically attuned races, Some Qual'Ath will take more traditional names, drawn from the cultures that surround them.

This is especially common in cases where both host and Qual'Ath share their body equally.": "为了与其他最不擅长灵媒的种族打交道，一些Qual'Ath会采用更传统的名字，来自他们周围的文化。在许多情况下，这些名字是对他们主人名字的微妙改动。这在宿主和Qual'Ath平等分享身体的情况下尤其常见。",

The blighted forces were already flooding the streets, and it would be only a matter of time before their eldrich hounds sniffed out the hiding places of the women and children seald away in the vault. Leskowel had won, and soon his armies would march upon the Atria and the entire kingdom would be lost.": "奥马向整个战场望去，看到的只是满目疮痍。卡森城成了一片废墟。他们的铁甲防线已经倒下，现在象牙塔只剩下灰烬和瓦砾。瘟疫势力已经充斥在街道上，他们的长老猎犬嗅出藏在地窖里的妇女和儿童的藏身之处只是时间问题。莱斯考威尔已经赢了，很快他的军队就会向阿特里亚进军，整个王国就会失去。",
	"With a solem light, and a final understanding of his purpose, Ohma pulled the blade form his friend's chest, and plunged it into his own. \"I am Sorry, old freind\" As the sacred seals that bound Ohma to this world began to unfurl, there was a strange inner peace that washed over him. This was where he was always mean to be. The entire reason for his existance was to culminate in this moment, and he was ready. The last of the psionic bindings fell from his etherial form, and a bright white glow flooded out from the core of his being, and he cast his wish.": "带着庄严的光芒和对自己目的的最终理解，奥马把刀从他朋友的胸口拔出来，插入自己的胸口。\"我很抱歉，老伙计。\"当将Ohma与这个世界联系在一起的神圣封印开始展开时，有一种奇怪的内在和平冲刷着他。这是他一直想去的地方。他存在的全部理由都将在这一刻达到顶峰，而他已经准备好了。最后的幻术束缚从他的乙醚形态中落下，一道明亮的白色光辉从他的核心中涌出，他施展了他的愿望。",
	"Seras Lionheart looked across the battlefeild with a mixture of pride and relief. The undead armies of Leskowel Von-Deirch had been stopped, and the mad King lay groveling at his feet, about to be beheaded. But as the multicolored light of dawn stretched out across the sky, he felt a pain in his chest, and a tear rolled down his eye. He could not help but feel that something was missing.": "塞拉斯-狮心带着自豪和欣慰的心情看向整个战场。莱斯考威尔-冯-迪尔希的不死军团已经被阻止，疯狂的国王躺在他脚下，即将被斩首。但是，当黎明的五彩光芒在天空中延伸开来时，他感到胸口一阵疼痛，一滴眼泪滚落下来。他不禁感到缺少了什么。",
