	"As a Dhampyr, your character has the following traits:": "作为一个Dhampyr，你的角色有以下特征。",
	"Dhampyr are exceptionally long-lived, but not immortal, typically reaching adulthood at the age of 50 and living to be almost 500 years old.": "达姆比尔人特别长寿，但不是不死之身，通常在50岁时达到成年，能活到近500岁。",
	"Dhampyr can be of any alignment, but their undead heritage and bloodthirst predisposes them to evil. Even if these impulses can be kept in check, they can never be extinguished completely; the smell of blood always makes a dhampyr's mouth water.": "丹皮尔可以有任何倾向，但他们的不死遗产和嗜血倾向使他们倾向于邪恶。即使这些冲动可以被控制住，它们也不可能被完全熄灭；血腥味总是让丹皮尔人口水直流。",
	"Dhampyr stand at the height of a normal human, but invariably have slim builds and gaunt features. Your size is Medium.": "拜尔族人的身高和正常人一样，但总是有苗条的身材和憔悴的特征。你的体型是中等。",
	"Your blood-red eyes pierce through the darkness. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "你血红色的眼睛可以穿透黑暗。你能在120英尺范围内看到昏暗的光线，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中也能看到昏暗的光线。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"You have a pair of extended incisors, a gift from your vampiric kin. As an action on your turn, you can bite a creature that is willing, grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, dealing {@damage 1d8} points of piercing damage and {@damage 1d4} points of necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt + your Constitution modifier. Additionally, you no longer need to eat for the next 24 hours.": "你有一对延长的门牙，这是来自你的吸血鬼亲属的礼物。在你的回合中，你可以咬住一个自愿的、被抓的、无能力的或被限制的生物，造成{@damage 1d8}点穿刺伤害和{@damage 1d4}点坏死伤害。你获得的临时命中率等于造成的坏死伤害+你的体质修饰因子。此外，你在接下来的24小时内不再需要进食。",
	"The necrotic damage increases to {@damage 2d4} at 6th level, {@damage 3d4} at 11th level, and {@damage 4d4} at 16th level.": "坏死的伤害在6级时增加到{@damage 2d4}，11级时增加到{@damage 3d4}，16级时增加到{@damage 4d4}。",
	"You know the cantrip {@spell minor illusion} and can cast it at will. At 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell charm person} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the {@spell spider climb} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "你知道{@spell minor illusion}的咒语，并能随心所欲地施放它。在3级时，你可以用这个特质施放一次（%1%）的咒语，并在完成长时间休息后重新获得施放的能力。当你达到5级时，你可以用这个特质施放一次{@spell spider climb}的法术，并在完成长时间休息后重新获得施放的能力。魅力是你对这些法术的施法能力。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Dhampyr. Dhampyr is a subtle language practiced in secret by vampires for centuries, and makes use of the elvish script. To the ear, it's smooth and sibilant; almost seductive, no matter the context.": "你可以说、读、写普通话和丹皮尔语。Dhampyr是一种微妙的语言，由吸血鬼秘密练习了几个世纪，并使用了精灵文字。对耳朵来说，它是平滑和咝咝作响的；无论在什么情况下，都几乎是诱人的。",
	"Aye, the dhampyr. I heard o' them. Nasty buggers - descended from vampires. If ye let yer guard down they'll suck ye dry. Me brother went to a village to save ‘em from a tribe of dhampyr. Bloodless corpses s'all they found, litt'ring the ground. Still haunts ‘im to this day.": "对，丹皮尔。我听说过他们。讨厌的家伙--吸血鬼的后代。如果你放松警惕，他们会把你吸干。我哥哥去了一个村庄，把他们从一个丹皮尔部落手里救出来。他们找到的都是无血的尸体，在地面上到处都是。直到今天，他仍然心有余悸。",
	"There's a really nasty dhampyr named Lord Bhragen, ‘e doesn' jus' kill people and drain ‘em dry. ‘E... ‘e stuffs ‘em. Turns ‘em inna some kin'a macabre museum. ‘Is victims weren' people to ‘im, they were trophies waitin' to be collected. Truly sick ‘e was. Was a glorious day it was, the day ‘e was killed.": "有一个非常讨厌的丹皮尔人，名叫布拉根勋爵，他不只杀人，还把他们榨干。'E... 他把他们塞进去。把他们变成某种可怕的博物馆。对他来说，受害者不是人，他们是等待被收集的战利品。他真的很变态。他被杀的那一天，是个光荣的日子。",
	"The dhampyr are a race descended from vampires, possessing many of the traits of their undead forebears, while lacking many of their weaknesses. The most prominent of these differences is that the dhampyr are unharmed by sunlight, earning them the common moniker, \"Daywalkers\".": "丹皮尔是吸血鬼的后裔，拥有他们不死祖先的许多特征，但却没有他们的许多弱点。这些差异中最突出的是，丹皮尔人不受阳光的伤害，因此他们被称为 \"日行者\"。",
	"The dhampyr are a mysterious race. Some scholars say they were created when a vampire bit a pregnant elf. Others profess they are the result of the unholy union of the living and the dead. Still more testify that the dhampyr were formed by the experiments of a vampire mage. Whatever the truth, the dhampyr exist, breed with the truly living, and walk among us.": "丹皮尔是一个神秘的种族。一些学者说他们是在一个吸血鬼咬了一个怀孕的精灵后产生的。其他人则声称他们是活人和死人的不洁结合的结果。还有人证明，丹皮尔是由一个吸血鬼法师的实验形成的。无论真相如何，丹皮尔存在，与真正的活人一起繁殖，并在我们中间行走。",
	"Even more complex is the dhampyr's relationship to undeath. They are not truly undead, but interact unpredictably with the blood of actual vampires. Sometimes a dhampyr can become a true vampire, but other times dhampyr perish as though poisoned by the blood. Either the effects are truly random, or speak volumes about the purity and variety of different vampire bloodlines.": "更为复杂的是丹皮尔与不死之身的关系。他们不是真正的不死之身，而是与真正的吸血鬼的血液发生不可预测的互动。有时丹皮尔可以成为真正的吸血鬼，但有时丹皮尔会像被血液毒死一样灭亡。这些影响要么是真正的随机的，要么说明了不同吸血鬼血统的纯度和多样性。",
	"Dhampyrs are usually pale of skin, with thin builds and slightly pointed ears. Perhaps their most prominent features are their pronounced canines and blood-red eyes, which shine in the moonlight like those of a predator. Dhampyr are exceedingly quick and tough, a result of the supernatural speed and fortitude of their unliving kin. Because of their nature as the spawn of the living dead, they are shunned by most living creatures. However, being partly alive, they are also spurned by their undead ancestors.": "拜尔族人通常皮肤苍白，身材瘦弱，耳朵稍尖。也许他们最突出的特征是他们明显的犬齿和血红色的眼睛，在月光下闪闪发光，就像捕食者的眼睛。拜尔族人非常敏捷和坚韧，这是他们的非活体亲属超自然的速度和毅力的结果。由于他们是活死人的后代，他们被大多数生物所回避。然而，由于部分是活人，他们也被他们的亡灵祖先所唾弃。",
	"With some effort, dhampyr can conceal their identities and walk among the living. Artificially coloring the skin and being careful never to smile in public is normally enough, but a dhampyr that is discovered is likely to simply be captured and executed for being a vampire, as inaccurate as this is.": "通过一些努力，丹皮尔人可以掩盖他们的身份，并在生活中行走。通常情况下，人为地给皮肤上色并小心翼翼地在公共场合不笑就足够了，但被发现的丹皮尔很可能会因为是吸血鬼而被抓住并被处决，尽管这很不准确。",
	"While the Dhampyr walk in the sun as they please, and are undeterred by doors and water, they are still subject to the curse of bloodthirst. The thirst of a Dhampyr is lesser than that of a true child of night, but still persistently felt. As a dhampyr can draw sustenance from normal food and drink, most dhampyr do not drink blood. Nonetheless, the dhampyr have fangs with which to drink and can partake when the cause arises.": "虽然拜尔族人在阳光下随心所欲地行走，并且不受门和水的影响，但他们仍然受到嗜血的诅咒。Dhampyr的渴求比真正的黑夜之子要小，但仍能持久地感受到。由于丹皮尔可以从正常的食物和饮料中获取养分，大多数丹皮尔不喝血。尽管如此，丹皮尔人有獠牙可以喝，并且在需要时可以喝。",
	"Dhampyr names often pay homage to powerful vampires and other undead, and serve to remind a young Dhampyr of their proud heritage and to give them strength in the lowliest of times.": "拜尔族人的名字通常向强大的吸血鬼和其他亡灵致敬，用来提醒年轻的拜尔族人他们骄傲的遗产，并在最卑微的时候给予他们力量。",
	"Acererak, Dracul, Nosferatu, Strahd, Vladimir": "Acererak, Dracul, Nosferatu, Strahd, Vladimir",
	"Drusilla, Lillith, Rayne, Salem, Vega": "Drusilla, Lillith, Rayne, Salem, Vega",
	"Aye, the dhampyr. I heard o' them. Nasty buggers - descended from vampires. If ye let yer guard down they'll suck ye dry. Me brother went to a village to save 'em from a tribe of dhampyr. Bloodless corpses s'all they found, litt'ring the ground.
