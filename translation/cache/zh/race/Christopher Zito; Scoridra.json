Contrary to having multiple heads on one body, this act does not tie a Scoridra to Her Majesty by blood or magical means, it was merely a rumor blown out of proportion.": "一个身体所能容纳的思想越多，就越被视为身体和精神力量的惊人壮举。在斯考瑞德社会中，多头斯考瑞德会自豪地认为自己是少数受祝福的人之一，他们的孩子与被称为女王陛下的八头斯考瑞德女王的传说联系在一起，女王陛下是一个古老的、据说是不朽的全姐妹头斯考瑞德，她的身体力量和综合火气可以创造火山，从她洗礼火焰的焦土上上升。与一个身体上有多个头相反，这种行为并没有通过血缘或魔法手段将一个斯科里德拉与女王陛下联系在一起，这只是一个被吹得不成样子的传言而已。",
	"Legends tell of great lizard like being born of fire, magma and brimstone, whose roots are close to that of Salamanders. While these tales are exaggerated for exuberant bard songs and pub stories, monster hunters and adventurers hear whispers that there is one such race akin to hydras that thrive in beds of lava, deep within volcanoes. Such creatures are said to follow the will of a eight headed she serpent of great and terrible power that could eradicate all life with a single flame. A savage race with multiple heads whipping around like serpents, molten fire tucked deep within their throats and anger as sharp and ferocious as their sets of gnashing razor like teeth. Yet even the most brave and battle hardened of these adventurers will not fear the might of these creatures that call themselves Scoridra, as the beasts often have to fight their greatest enemies to even accomplish any dastardly scheme the storytellers claim, themselves.": "传说中，伟大的蜥蜴就像从火、岩浆和硫磺中诞生的一样，其根源与蝾螈的根源相近。虽然这些故事被夸张地用在了热情洋溢的吟游诗人歌曲和酒吧故事中，但怪物猎人和冒险家们听到的悄悄话是，有一个类似于水蛇的种族在火山深处的熔岩床中生长。据说这种生物遵循一条八头母蛇的意志，具有巨大而可怕的力量，可以用一团火焰消灭所有生命。一个野蛮的种族，多个头颅像蛇一样甩来甩去，熔化的火焰深藏在他们的喉咙里，愤怒就像他们那对咬牙切齿的刀片一样锋利和凶猛。然而，即使是最勇敢、最善战的冒险者也不会惧怕这些自称为斯科里德拉的生物的威力，因为这些野兽往往要与它们最大的敌人作战，甚至要完成说书人所说的任何卑鄙的计划，自己。",
	"Long ago in the realms of fire, a great and terrible beast with eight leviathan-like heads emerged from an exploding volcano, this creature's booming voice summoned forth a meteor shower so grand that the craters left from the devastation molded more volcanoes to rise from the scorched earth. All creatures born of Draconic nature would call this monster \"Her Majesty\" as no force in the realms could stop her. Kingdoms banded together in counsel to devise a way to stop \"Her Majesty\", each attempt to forcefully stop \"Her Majesty\" has met with failure, but then a Dragonborn wizard instead posed an idea. To stop \"Her Majesty\"'s rage, they must instead redirect her rage, but where? Sending her to another realm would be seen as invasion. While that would stoke \"Her Majesty\"'s flames brighter upon others, the wizard shook their head. Would a sacrafice quell her then? While an offering large enough would perhapse have her advert her fire for a brief period, the wizard shook their head. \"Nay, we will direct her rage upon herself.\" Said the wizard and so they traveled to the volcanic birthplace of \"Her Majesty\", calling out to her asking which of \"Her Majesty\"'s heads was the true queen. \"Her Majesty\"'s siblings turned to each other with sneers, unable to decide who among them was the one true queen. Unable to come to terms with themselves, the sisters set their fire upon themselves. With great and powerful blows, \"Her Majesty\" had slayed herself by cutting off her own heads, the wizard acting quickly banished, the heads to dimensions unknown. With her heads servered and her powers scattered to the rift, \"Her Majesty\"'s body fell leaving the corpse as proof of the wizard's victory. The wizard returned home to tell their people of the news of \"Her Majesty\"'s demise, but her blood pouring from her body seeped into the volcano and was left unchecked. As eons pasted, a new race emerged from the lava with the memories of the former queen's rage and the spirit of competition burned deeply upon their souls.": "很久以前，在火的领域里，一个有着八个利维坦式头颅的伟大而可怕的野兽从一座爆炸的火山中走出来，这个生物轰鸣的声音召唤出了一场流星雨，如此宏大，破坏后留下的弹坑塑造了更多的火山，从焦土上升起。所有生来就具有龙人本性的生物都会称这个怪物为 \"女王陛下\"，因为在这个世界上没有任何力量可以阻止她。各个王国联合起来商议如何阻止 \"女王陛下\"，每次试图强行阻止 \"女王陛下 \"都以失败告终，但后来一位龙裔巫师反而提出了一个想法。为了阻止 \"女王陛下 \"的愤怒，他们必须改变她的愤怒的方向，但在哪里呢？把她送到另一个境界会被视为入侵。虽然这将激起 \"女王陛下 \"的火焰，使之在其他人身上更加明亮，但巫师摇了摇头。那么献祭能平息她吗？虽然一个足够大的祭品可能会让她短暂地宣传她的火焰，但巫师摇了摇头。\"不，我们要把她的怒火引向她自己。\" 巫师说，于是他们前往 \"女王陛下 \"的火山发源地，向她呼唤，询问 \"女王陛下 \"的哪个脑袋是真正的女王。\"女王陛下 \"的兄弟姐妹们互相讥笑着，无法决定他们中谁是真正的女王。由于无法接受自己的观点，姐妹们把火烧到了自己身上。在巨大而有力的打击下，\"女王陛下 \"通过砍下自己的头颅来杀死了自己，巫师的行为很快被放逐，头颅被送到了未知的空间。随着她的头颅被役使，她的力量被分散到裂缝中，\"女王陛下 \"的身体倒下了，留下的尸体是巫师胜利的证明。巫师回到家告诉他们的人民 \"女王陛下 \"死亡的消息，但她的血液从她的身体里涌出，渗入火山，没有被控制。随着时间的推移，一个新的种族从熔岩中出现，他们的灵魂中深深烙印着前女王的愤怒和竞争精神的记忆。",
	"While Scoridra are considered one creature, from the neck up they spit into two hydra-esk heads, which are treated as twin brothers or sisters depending on the gender of the Scoridra body. The heads normally are two brothers or two sisters, though while extremely rare, a Scoridra having duel gender heads is possible. However the main body may only take on the genetics of one gender. Both heads control the body in unison and feel the physical effects of the main body, such as feeling nourishment of food, feeling the effects of a curse and being under the influence of alcohol, illness and physical trauma. However the heads are their own personalities with different wants, needs and desires. When interacting with a Scoridra one must consider the brother's or sister's differences in personality and appearances as they will technically be in contact with two siblings in one body. Scoridra are prideful beings and crave validation for their feats in any skillset no matter how trivial or grand. Seeing one sibling act out a great deed will often send the other sibling into a fit of jealous or rage and the siblings will bicker or compete against each other to prove who is the superior sibling. It takes great concentration and will power for Scoridra to cooperate on a matter, but most adventurers who travel with or enlist the aid of the Scoridra find it easier to turning a job into a competition for the siblings to both compete in. That way the Scoridra not only benefits the task at hand but this trickery will also to curb their competitive natures.": "虽然Scoridra被认为是一种生物，但从脖子往上看，他们会吐出两个九头蛇的头，根据Scoridra身体的性别，它们被当作双胞胎兄弟或姐妹。头部通常是两兄弟或两姐妹，虽然极其罕见，但Scoridra拥有双性别的头部是可能的。然而，主体可能只具有一个性别的基因。两个头颅统一控制身体，并感受到主体的身体影响，如感受食物的滋养，感受诅咒的影响和受到酒精、疾病和身体创伤的影响。然而头部是他们自己的个性，有不同的愿望、需求和欲望。当与Scoridra互动时，必须考虑到兄弟或姐妹在个性和外表上的差异，因为从技术上讲，他们将在一个身体里与两个兄弟姐妹接触。斯科里德拉是个骄傲的人，他们渴望自己在任何技能方面的成就得到验证，不管是多么微不足道还是多么伟大。看到一个兄弟姐妹做了一件伟大的事，往往会让另一个兄弟姐妹陷入嫉妒或愤怒，兄弟姐妹会争吵或相互竞争，以证明谁是优越的兄弟姐妹。Scoridra需要极大的注意力和意志力才能在一件事上合作，但大多数与Scoridra一起旅行或寻求其帮助的冒险家发现，将一项工作变成兄弟姐妹双方的竞争会更容易。这样一来，斯考瑞德拉不仅对手头的任务有利，而且这种诡计也会抑制他们的竞争天性。",
	"Scoridra bodies house multiple personalities, as such the two or multiple heads of the body will have their own names, however the body that houses the personalities along with them will also have a name acting as a sort of surname.
