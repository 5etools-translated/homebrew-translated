	"Man-Ogres have thick skin, powerfully muscular builds and are of monstrous size, as they stand around 7 to 8 feet tall. Though their Ogre heritage has led them to increase in physical size and strength, the Man-Ogre's intelligence declined to below average human levels. Possessed of little more than only primitive survival instincts, part of their nonhuman heritage involved the loss of the ability for more complex intellectual thought since philosophical matters were unnecessary in an environment marked by starvation and a constant fight for life.": "人妖有厚厚的皮肤，强大的肌肉构造，体型巨大，因为他们大约有7到8英尺高。虽然他们的食人魔血统使他们的体型和力量增加，但人妖的智力却下降到低于人类的平均水平。他们拥有的只是原始的生存本能，他们的非人类遗产的一部分涉及到失去了更复杂的智力思维能力，因为在一个以饥饿和不断为生活而战为特征的环境中，哲学问题是不必要的。",
	"Man-Ogres are said to be even less intelligent than some Orcs. However, the truth is that their intellects are not in fact stunted, but much more focused on matters such as survival.

	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnoll.": "你能说、读、写普通话和格诺尔语。",
	"Gnoll legends trace the origin of their species back to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.": "地精的传说可以追溯到一个时期，当时恶魔领主Yeenoghu找到了他的方式，在物质世界中横冲直撞。一群普通的鬣狗跟在他的后面，捡拾恶魔领主的猎物。这些鬣狗变成了第一批地精，在耶诺古身后游行，直到他被驱逐回深渊。然后，这些地精散落在世界的各个角落，成为恶魔力量的可怕提醒。",
	"This is the tale gnoll mothers tell their pups and the story the scourge uses to exhort his troops. Whether it is truth or mere legend, it is easy to see the inspiration for the myth. A gnoll looks much like a humanoid hyena and shares many traits with the animal, including its haunting laughter, and the strength and savagery of these creatures is enough to suggest demonic blood; the typical gnoll band strikes without fear or mercy, tearing into enemies with the fury of fiends incarnate.": "这是地精母亲告诉他们的幼崽的故事，也是祸害用来劝说他的部队的故事。无论它是事实还是纯粹的传说，都很容易看出这个神话的灵感。侏儒看起来很像人形土狼，与动物有许多共同的特征，包括它那令人不安的笑声，而这些生物的力量和野蛮程度足以表明它们有恶魔的血统；典型的侏儒队伍毫无畏惧或怜悯地进行攻击，以恶魔化身的愤怒撕咬敌人。",
	"In spite of the savage nature of the gnolls, there are some aspects to their culture that are not inherently repulsive. Gnolls place a very strong value on family for instance, respecting blood ties perhaps more than any other aspect of a relationship. Though gnolls within a pack will commonly fight with each other for dominance, these battles are quickly forgotten after their resolution, and in most situations, gnolls of the same bloodline are loyal friends and allies to one another. These bloodlines are almost always traced maternally, through the female line.": "尽管地精具有野蛮的本性，但他们的文化中也有一些本质上并不令人厌恶的方面。例如，地精非常重视家庭，对血缘关系的尊重可能超过关系的任何其他方面。尽管地精在族群中通常会为了统治权而互相争斗，但这些争斗在解决后很快就会被遗忘，而且在大多数情况下，同一血统的地精是彼此忠诚的朋友和盟友。这些血统几乎总是通过母系，通过女性的血统来追溯。",
	"This loyalty to family is particularly obvious during combat, either with rival gnoll packs or other races. Gnolls who fight side by side regularly throw away personal glory in order to help their brethren. Perhaps most surprisingly, when a gnoll is separated from their clan and family their instinctive need for such blood ties leads them to form a surrogate \"pack\" from those whom they choose to befriend. To these unlikely allies the gnoll is as loyal and faithful as they would be to their own brothers or sisters, embracing the outsiders as if they were family.": "这种对家庭的忠诚在战斗中尤其明显，无论是与敌对的地精族群还是其他种族。并肩作战的地精经常放弃个人荣誉，以帮助他们的兄弟。也许最令人惊讶的是，当一个地精与他们的部族和家庭分离时，他们对这种血缘关系的本能需求导致他们从那些他们选择结交的人中形成一个代用的 \"族群\"。对于这些不可能的盟友，地精就像对自己的兄弟姐妹一样忠诚和忠实，把外来者当作家人一样拥抱。",
	"While all gnolls have an innate tendency for collecting souvenirs and trophies, nomadic packs, particularly the savage ones who have little contact with other races except during wartime, find few other ways to acquire technology, having crafted a handful of tools of their own. The result of this is that most gnolls rely on the other races as their source of wealth and technology; which extends to arms and weaponry, giving gnoll armour a unique aesthetic where each suit is typically kitbashed together from scavenged pieces found either on victims or abandoned.": "虽然所有的地精都有收集纪念品和战利品的先天倾向，但游牧族群，尤其是那些除了战时很少与其他种族接触的野蛮族群，几乎找不到其他获得技术的途径，他们自己制作的工具屈指可数。这样做的结果是，大多数地精依靠其他种族作为他们的财富和技术来源；这也延伸到了军火和武器装备上，使地精的盔甲具有独特的美感，每件盔甲通常都是由在受害者身上或被遗弃的碎片拼凑而成。",
	"Gnolls of all kinds have an affinity for hyenas, who many see as their brethren and whom they keep as pets or for hunting.": "各种类型的地精都对鬣狗情有独钟，许多人把鬣狗视为自己的兄弟，把它们当作宠物或用于狩猎。",
	"First names have a flow-y yet growl-like sound. Surnames are always the name of the pack they belong to. Pack names will be compounded words. They can describe either the members of the pack, or where that pack lives.": "名字有一种流动的但又像生长的声音。姓氏总是他们所属的包的名称。群体名称将是复合词。它们既可以描述族群的成员，也可以描述该族群的居住地。",
