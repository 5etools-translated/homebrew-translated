	"Fierce hunters and faultless trackers, the thri-kreen are a race of insect-folk sometimes known as \"mantis warriors.\" They are inscrutable, alien creatures; those who do not know them well believe them to be bloodthirsty monsters. Nomadic folk who spend their brief lives roaming vast distances of the deserts, scrublands, and savannas of the south, thri-kreen are near-perfect hunters.": "凶猛的猎人和无懈可击的追踪者，thri-kreen是一个昆虫民族，有时被称为 \"螳螂战士\"。他们是难以捉摸的外来生物；那些不熟悉他们的人认为他们是嗜血的怪物。游牧民族在南方的沙漠、灌木丛和大草原上漫游，度过他们短暂的一生，他们是近乎完美的猎手。",
	"A thri-kreen resembles a bipedal praying mantis. Its body's exoskeleton is sandy yellow in color. Of the body's six limbs, the lower two are used for walking, and the upper four end in four-fingered, clawlike hands. Thri-kreen have large, dangerous mandibles and compound eyes. Two small antennae sprout from the tops of their heads. They wear little clothing beyond simple harnesses for carrying weapons and equipment.": "Thri-Kreen类似于双足的螳螂。它身体的外骨骼是沙黄色的。在身体的六个肢体中，下面的两个肢体用于行走，上面的四个肢体末端是四指的爪状手。Thri-kreen有大而危险的下颚和复眼。两根小触角从他们的头顶长出。除了用于携带武器和设备的简单背带，他们几乎不穿衣服。",
	"Each thri-kreen forms deep attachments with a handful of other individuals, regarding them as clutch-mates, companions to be defended with one's own life if need be. All others outside this small group of companions are strangers and enemies, although thri-kreen are intelligent enough to recognize that one traveling alone in the lands of other folk would be wise to keep such observations to oneself.": "每个Thri-Green人都与少数几个人形成了深厚的感情，把他们视为伙伴，必要时用自己的生命来保护他们。在这一小群伙伴之外的所有其他人都是陌生人和敌人，尽管Thri-kreen有足够的智慧认识到，一个人在其他民族的土地上旅行，保持这种观察是明智的。",
	"Thri-kreen employ a language without words. To show emotion and reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. When forced to interact with creatures of other intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass. More civilized thri-kreen take to learning Common, but cannot speak it, due to their mandible structure.": "Thri-kreen使用一种没有语言的语言。为了表示情绪和反应，Thri-Kreen会敲打下颚，挥动触角，让其他Thri-Kreen感觉到它在想什么和感觉到什么。其他生物发现这种交流方式很难解释，也无法复制。当被迫与其他智能物种的生物互动时，thri-kreen会采用其他交流方式，如在沙子上画画，或用树枝或草叶做画。更加文明的thri-kreen开始学习普通话，但由于他们的下颚结构，他们不能说普通话。",
	"Thri-kreen experience the full range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions, particularly if they live near or interact with humans or other highly emotional creatures.": "Thri-kreen能体验到全部的情绪，但不像人类那样容易情绪失控。具有幻觉能力的Thri-kreen常常表现出更广泛的情绪，特别是当他们生活在人类或其他高度情绪化的生物附近或与之互动时。",
	"Thri-kreen view themselves as noble hunters and judge other folk on the simple relationship of predator to prey. They respect barbarians, rangers, and others who live off the land and treat the land with care. On the other hand, savage and evil races such as gnolls and orcs despoil the lands that should be hunted with respect, and thus earn the thri-kreen's enmity. The mantis warriors generally regard city folk and farmers of other races as not-hunters, and therefore not worth their attention (but also unworthy of their enmity).": "Thri-kreen认为自己是高贵的猎手，并以捕食者与猎物的简单关系来判断其他民俗。他们尊重野蛮人、游侠和其他以土地为生的人，并谨慎地对待土地。另一方面，野蛮和邪恶的种族，如地精和兽人，掠夺了应该被尊重的猎物的土地，从而赢得了Thri-Green的敌意。螳螂战士通常将其他种族的城市居民和农民视为非狩猎者，因此不值得他们关注（但也不值得他们敌视）。",

On average, thri-kreen live about 30 to 35 years, though there are Thri-kreen legends about one of their number who lived almost 4 times as long as normal.": "Thri-kreen的寿命相对较短，只在2年后达到成熟。平均而言，Thri-kreen的寿命约为30至35岁，不过有关于他们中的一个人寿命几乎是正常人的4倍的Thri-kreen传说。",
	"Thri-kreen have virtually no social structure other than the clutches they form with their closest allies. The notion of sophisticated rules for social behavior is foreign to them. They are almost always chaotic in alignment, and often neutral with respect to good and evil.": "除了与最亲密的盟友组成的团体外，Thri-kreen几乎没有社会结构。复杂的社会行为规则的概念对他们来说是陌生的。他们几乎总是混沌的，在善与恶的问题上往往是中立的。",
	"Thri-kreen tend to hunch when walking around, appearing to be as tall as a human. When fully upright, a thri-kreen stands between 6 and 7 feet tall. They weigh about 150 pounds on average. Your size is Medium.": "Thri-kreen走动时倾向于驼背，看起来和人类一样高。当完全直立时，特里格林人的身高在6到7英尺之间。他们平均体重约为150磅。你的体型是中等。",

Finally, you may interact with an additional object (like drawing or stowing something) each turn.": "你有四条手臂，可以用来拿东西。其中两只是较小的小臂，不能拿盾牌或用武器攻击。小臂可以操纵物体，并执行法术的体能部分。这些额外的手臂并不授予你通常所授予的额外攻击。最后，你可以在每一回合与一个额外的物体互动（比如画画或存放东西）。",
	"You don't require sleep to function. As such, magic can't put you to sleep. You still must take long rests and can perform nothing more than a light task during said rest.": "你不需要睡眠来运作。因此，魔法无法使你入睡。你仍然必须进行长时间的休息，并且在上述休息期间只能执行轻度任务。",
	"You can comprehend, read, and write Common, and can speak Thri-Kreen. Thri-Kreen is a language that is seemingly wordless, where thoughts and ideas are conveyed through specific clacking of mandibles, waving of antennae, and gesturing of hands. Only thri-kreen have the physical features necessary to speak the language properly.": "你能理解、阅读和书写普通话，并能说Thri-Kreen语。Thri-Kreen是一种看似无字的语言，思想和观点通过下颚的具体咔哒声、触角的挥舞和手势来传达。只有Thri-Kreen有必要的身体特征来正确地讲这种语言。",

	"We abandoned most of our carried items and donkeys to speed our flight toward the elevators, but we were cut off by kobold snipers who split-moved and fired, ducking back behind stones and corners after launching steel-tipped bolts and arrows, javelins, hand axes, and more flaming oil bottles. We ran into an unexplored section of Level One, taking damage all the time. It was then we discovered that these kobolds had honeycombed the first level with small tunnels to speed their movements. Kobold commandos were everywhere. All of our hirelings died. Most of our henchmen followed. We were next.": "我们放弃了大部分携带的物品和驴子，加速向电梯飞去，但我们被哥布林狙击手截住了，他们分头行动和射击，在发射了钢尖螺栓和箭矢、标枪、手斧和更多的火焰油瓶后，又躲到了石头和角落里。我们跑到第一层的一个未开发的部分，一直在承受伤害。这时我们才发现，这些哥布林在第一层用小隧道蜂拥而上，以加快他们的行动。哥布林突击队到处都是。我们所有的雇佣兵都死了。我们的大部分随从也跟着死了。我们是下一个。",
	"Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.": "哥布林是懦弱的爬行动物，他们把邪恶的龙当作半神来崇拜，并作为爪牙和奴仆为他们服务。哥布林在可能的情况下居住在龙的巢穴中，但更常见的是在地下城中出没，收集宝物和饰品，以增加他们自己的小囤积。",
	"Kobolds are egg-laying creatures which breed prodigiously, laying eggs quickly which rapidly mature. While some grow long enough to be \"great wyrms\" over a century old, most perish before their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.": "哥布林是一种产蛋的生物，繁殖力强，产蛋速度快，成熟快。虽然有些人长到足以成为超过一个世纪的 \"大巫妖\"，但大多数人在第一个十年前就已经死亡。他们身体虚弱，很容易成为掠食者的猎物。这种弱点迫使他们团结起来。他们的数量优势可以赢得与强大对手的战斗，但往往会造成哥布林人方面的大量伤亡。",
	"Kobolds venerate dragons, to which they believe they are kin. The origin of this connection is unclear, based heavily on folklore and myth, but the relationship is undeniable and shapes every aspect of kobold religion.": "哥布林崇敬龙，他们认为自己是龙的亲属。这种联系的起源并不清楚，主要是基于民间传说和神话，但这种关系是不可否认的，并影响着哥布林宗教的各个方面。",
	"In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind.": "除了他们所崇敬的龙之外，哥布林还崇拜一个名叫库图尔马克的较小的神。传说中，库图尔马克在九层地狱担任提亚马特的附庸，直到地精之神加尔-闪金（Garl Glittergold）从龙后的囤积物中偷走了一件饰品。提亚玛特派库图尔马克去取回饰品，但加尔-闪金耍了个花招，使大地塌陷，将哥布林神困在地下迷宫中，直到永远。由于这个原因，哥布林讨厌地精和任何形式的恶作剧。",
	"Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Kobolds take great pride in constructing their elaborate warrens and defending them with nefarious traps. Designed with low tunnels, kobolds can move easily through their lairs which hinder larger humanoids. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures, and are thoroughly ruthless against invaders. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesheating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.": "哥布林以其制造陷阱和挖掘隧道的聪明才智来弥补其身体上的无能。哥布林对建造他们精心设计的巢穴和用邪恶的陷阱来保卫它们感到非常自豪。设计成低矮的隧道，哥布林可以很容易地在他们的巢穴中移动，这阻碍了较大的人类。最阴险的哥布林陷阱利用了自然危害和其他生物，对入侵者彻底无情。一根绊马索可能会连接到一个装有弹簧的陷阱上，这个陷阱会向入侵者投掷粘土罐中的肉质绿色粘液，或将一箱箱有毒的巨型蜈蚣抛向入侵者。",

	"A meld is a form of communal meditation that allows myconids to transcend their dull subterranean existence. The myconids' rapport spores bind the participants into a group consciousness. Hallucination spores then induce a shared dream that provides entertainment and social interaction. Myconids consider melding to be the purpose of their existence.

Lizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive. Lizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.

	"Kenku conceal their sleek, dark feathers with ill-fitted cloaks, robes, and rags, which are a mark of their shame. Kenku are flightless, but legend holds that this was not always the case: they once hand magnificent wings and spoke the beautiful language of birds, but both of these were stripped away from them as punishment for their greed. Now kenku jealously hold all birds in contempt and shamefully hide their avian forms.": "Kenku用不合身的斗篷、长袍和破布来掩盖他们光滑、黑暗的羽毛，这是他们耻辱的标志。Kenku不会飞，但传说并不总是这样：他们曾经拥有华丽的翅膀，说着美丽的鸟语，但这两样东西都被剥夺了，作为对他们贪婪的惩罚。现在，肯库嫉妒地蔑视所有的鸟类，并可耻地隐藏他们的鸟类形态。",

	"Because kenku have no formal language, and borrow words and sounds to form the concepts they wish to communicate, naming conventions are extremely loose. A kenku's name is as likely to be a nonsense word from Dwarven as it is the exact sound of a dog barking, as it is to be the word 'Scarce' as spoken by a dragonborn with an exotic accent decades ago.

It was then we realized what a bad idea this had been.": "\"呀！\"山洞里传出了哭声。从门里冲出的是一群地精。我们大喊大叫，向他们砍来砍去。他们褐色的血液洒了我们一身，但即使是在部落倒在我们面前时，更多的人冲上前去取代他们。这时我们才意识到这是一个多么糟糕的主意。",
	"Goblins are a race of childlike creatures with a destructive and voracious nature that makes them almost universally despised. Weak and cowardly, goblins are frequently manipulated or enslaved by stronger creatures that need destructive, disposable foot soldiers.": "妖精是一个像孩子一样的生物种族，具有破坏性和贪婪的天性，这使他们几乎被普遍鄙视。弱小和懦弱的妖精经常被需要破坏性的、可有可无的步兵的强大生物所操纵或奴役。",
	"Given enough supplies, a goblin eats nearly a dozen meals a day. Most goblin tribes never have enough supplies to accommodate their ravenous appetites, which inevitably leads to raiding, one of the great goblin pastimes. Collectively, an entire goblin tribe could, like a vast plague, strip the countryside of all its livestock and wildlife, along with anything that even remotely looks edible, but due to fear of leaving home and possibly losing their own territory to neighboring tribes, raiding parties tend to be small and mobile.": "如果有足够的补给，一个地精一天要吃十几顿。大多数地精部落从来没有足够的补给来满足他们贪婪的胃口，这不可避免地导致了掠夺，这是地精的伟大消遣之一。整个地精部落可以像一场巨大的瘟疫一样，把乡下所有的牲畜和野生动物以及任何看起来可以吃的东西都剥光，但由于害怕离家出走，可能会把自己的领地丢给邻近的部落，突击队往往是小规模和流动的。",
	"Goblins have an immense, and well-founded, disdain for dogs and horses, the pets and steeds of man. Always the early-warning alarm of human settlements, dogs can always eek out the stench of goblins, even when they approach under cover of night. Of course, countless numbers of goblins have been torn to shreds by man's best friend; it's no wonder that the most common type of knife in the goblin language translates to 'dogslicer.' Horses are no better, able to stamp a goblin's skull in with an errant step, and always ridden by humans on the warpath. Therefore, dogs and horses are the first to be slain if a goblin raiding party can enter a village unannounced.": "妖精对狗和马这些人类的宠物和骏马有着巨大的、有根据的蔑视。狗总是人类定居点的预警警报，它总能嗅出妖精的臭味，即使它们在夜色的掩护下接近。当然，无数的妖精被人类最好的朋友撕成了碎片；难怪在妖精的语言中，最常见的刀子被翻译成 \"屠狗者\"。马也好不到哪里去，只要一不小心，就能把地精的头骨踩碎，而且总是被人类骑在马上作战。因此，如果一个地精突击队能在不经意间进入一个村庄，狗和马是第一个被杀的。",
	"In spite of this fact, goblins train wolves and occasionally worgs to ride as steeds, but they are quick to point out that these are not dogs. Certainly, this is a special brand of goblin animosity, and no amount of hair-splitting can convince them that dogs and wolves are remotely similar.": "尽管有这个事实，地精还是训练狼，偶尔也训练虫子作为骏马骑行，但他们很快就指出，这些不是狗。当然，这是地精的一种特殊的敌意，无论怎么解释都无法说服他们相信狗和狼有一点相似。",
	"Goblins are fundamentally impulsive, possessing little to no self-control.": "妖精从根本上说是冲动的，几乎不具备自控能力。",
	"Setting things on fire is another great goblin past time. Although fairly careful about lighting fires within their own tribe's lairs, a goblin with a torch is a sign of terrible things to come. For this reason, alchemist's fire and flasks of oil rarely last more than a few minutes in a goblin's possession. Typically, fires begin just as soon as the goblin can determine what object within eyesight would look the most interesting ablaze.": "放火是地精的另一个伟大的消遣方式。虽然在自己部落的巢穴里点火是相当小心的，但拿着火把的地精是可怕事情来临的标志。出于这个原因，炼金术士的火和油壶在地精手中很少能持续超过几分钟。通常情况下，只要地精能确定在视线范围内什么物体燃烧起来看起来最有趣，火就会开始燃烧。",
	"This impulsiveness is a good candidate for explaining other odd goblin behaviors. For example, the fact that goblins think of things like ovens as good hiding places reveals much about their inability to think plans through to the most likely outcome. Moreover, they tend to be easily distracted, particularly by shiny things and animals smaller than them that might make a good meal.": "这种冲动性是解释其他奇怪的妖精行为的一个很好的候选人。例如，妖精认为像烤箱这样的东西是很好的藏身之处，这一事实揭示了他们没有能力将计划考虑到最可能的结果。此外，他们往往很容易分心，特别是被闪亮的东西和比他们小的动物所吸引，而这些东西可能是一顿好饭。",
	"It's been widely rumored that goblins think writing and painting steals your soul, but the truth is, noone knows why goblins love to sing their songs. Around the campfire of a goblin lair, or in the midst of a raid on a human settlement, dozens of goblins chanting in unison can be a terrifying thing to hear. It's possible that this is how goblins best remember things; that they use songs to communicate what things to eat, and what things to avoid. It would go a long way to explain goblins' lack of common sense: some words are difficult to rhyme.": "人们普遍传言，妖精认为写作和绘画会偷走你的灵魂，但事实是，没有人知道为什么妖精喜欢唱他们的歌。在妖精巢穴的篝火旁，或者在突袭人类定居点的时候，几十个妖精齐声吟唱，听起来是一件很可怕的事情。这有可能是地精记忆事物的最佳方式；他们用歌曲来传达什么东西要吃，什么东西要避免。这将在很大程度上解释妖精们缺乏常识的原因：有些词很难押韵。",
	"Goblins have a single given name, but the most accomplished, nearly always including chieftains, also have a simplistic title reflecting their deeds.": "妖精有一个单一的名字，但最有成就的人，几乎总是包括首领，也有一个反映他们事迹的简单化的称号。",

	"You can use your powerful mandibles to inject your foes with a potent paralytic venom. Unarmed strikes made with your bite deal {@damage 1d4} piercing damage.

	"Thri-kreen of this subrace are stronger and tougher than other thri-kreen. They possess a potent venom used to subdue their prey, as well as a hardened exoskeleton.

At 15th level, the fly speed increases to 40 feet.": "你获得了每下降5英尺就能滑行20英尺的能力，从任何落下的距离中都会受到1/2的伤害。在第5级时，这些翅膀更加坚固，可以让你更柔和地着陆，并且不受任何坠落距离的伤害。在10级时，这些翅膀赋予了以25英尺的基本速度飞行的能力，尽管你需要飞行至少10英尺或者做一个DC16强度的救赎才不会坠落。15级时，飞行速度增加到40英尺。",

This damage does not stack with other sources of extra damage on this attack, such as a rogue's Sneak Attack.": "在树上攀爬和移动时，你的运动能力和杂技检查具有优势。此外，你可以从10英尺以上的高空坠落，从上面攻击一个生物，在攻击中获得优势，并且每下降10英尺就会造成额外的（%0%）伤害。这个伤害不会与其他攻击来源的额外伤害叠加，例如流氓的偷袭。",
	"You are proficient with {@item shortbow|PHB|shortbows}.": "你精通（%0%）。",
	"More powerfully built than their other lizardfolk kin, the blackscales are alarmingly violent.

This cycle of savage domination of weaker creatures has earned all lizardfolk a reputation for barbarity.": "比起其他蜥蜴人的亲戚，黑鳞人的身材更加强壮，他们的暴力程度令人震惊。沼泽地的黑鳞首领无疑是部落中最强壮的成员；如果不是这样，他很快就会被更强大的继任者废黜并杀死。这种对弱小生物的野蛮统治循环为所有蜥蜴人赢得了野蛮的声誉。",

	"While smaller than other lizardfolk, the poison dusk lizardfolk are just as dangerous when provoked. A poison dusk lizardfolk's scales shift color to match its surroundings, making it a naturally stealthy hunter. Combined with their affinity for making poisons, this makes poison dusk lizardfolk the most dangerous when you can't see them.": "虽然比其他蜥蜴人小，但毒黄昏蜥蜴人在被挑衅时也同样危险。毒黄昏蜥蜴人的鳞片会随着周围环境的变化而改变颜色，使它成为一个天生的隐秘的猎手。再加上它们制造毒药的能力，这使得毒黄昏蜥蜴人在你看不见它们的时候是最危险的。",

	"You can change the color of your scales to match the color and texture of your natural surroundings as a bonus action.

Moving out of the matched terrain, such as by moving indoors or by moving to an area with different vegetation or rocks (usually any area over 100 feet from where you first camouflaged), causes you to lose this advantage. Once changed, you must complete a short or long rest before you may use this feature again. When not camouflaged, your scales shift color based on your mood.": "你可以改变你鳞片的颜色，以配合你周围自然环境的颜色和质地，这是一个额外的动作。在伪装的时候，你的灵巧（（%0%））检查有优势，可以在匹配的地形中隐藏。移出匹配的地形，例如移到室内或移到有不同植被或岩石的区域（通常是离你第一次伪装的地方超过100英尺的任何区域），会使你失去这一优势。一旦改变，你必须完成一个短期或长期的休息，才能再次使用这一特性。在不进行伪装时，你的鳞片会根据你的情绪改变颜色。",

	"Most goblin tribes choose to make their home in sprawling underground complexes, riddled with tunnels and passageways large enough only for them, though it's not uncommon to find them inhabiting structures built for much larger creatures. The underground is an ideal goblin home, as it provides a defensible location from which to raid the surrounding settlements, and it limits the strength of larger creatures who intrude into their territory. For example, on normal ground, an ogre could crush dozens of goblins with ease, but it wouldn't last long surrounded by goblins in a tight corridor.": "大多数地精部落选择在庞大的地下建筑群中安家，其中布满了只够他们使用的隧道和通道，不过他们居住在为更大的生物建造的建筑中也并不罕见。地下是一个理想的地精家园，因为它提供了一个可防御的地点，可以突袭周围的定居点，并且限制了闯入它们领地的大型生物的力量。例如，在正常的地面上，食人魔可以轻而易举地粉碎几十个地精，但它不会在狭窄的走廊里被地精包围太久。",
	"You are exceptional at squeezing through narrow passages and other tight spaces. You suffer no movement penalty from crawling, and, if you were standing when you began your turn, standing back up costs no movement.": "你在挤过狭窄的通道和其他狭小的空间方面非常出色。你不会因为爬行而受到动作上的惩罚，而且，如果你在开始转身时是站着的，重新站起来也不需要动作。",

They display a type of mad ingenuity, daily constructing insane contraptions from junk they find to accomplish a task, often hunting or defending themselves from larger predators, in the meanwhile collecting useful garbage from the waste. On any other creature, this ability to see usefulness in junk would look like genius; on a goblin, it almost always means inventive types of havoc is sure to follow.": "有些妖精部落在没有巢穴的保护下生存。相反，这些地精存在于较小的群体中，不断地在其他生物的垃圾中进行突袭和搜刮，以找到生存所需的有用东西。他们表现出一种疯狂的聪明才智，每天用他们找到的垃圾构造出疯狂的装置来完成任务，经常猎杀或抵御较大的掠食者，同时从垃圾中收集有用的垃圾。在任何其他生物身上，这种从垃圾中看到有用的能力看起来像是天才；在地精身上，它几乎总是意味着创造性的破坏肯定会随之而来。",
