	"Thri-kreen have relatively short lifespans, reaching maturity after only 2 years. On average, thri-kreen live about 30 to 35 years, though there are Thri-kreen legends about one of their number who lived almost 4 times as long as normal.": "Thri-kreen的寿命相对较短，只在2年后达到成熟。平均而言，Thri-kreen的寿命约为30至35岁，不过有关于他们中的一个人寿命几乎是正常人的4倍的Thri-kreen传说。",
	"Thri-kreen have virtually no social structure other than the clutches they form with their closest allies. The notion of sophisticated rules for social behavior is foreign to them. They are almost always chaotic in alignment, and often neutral with respect to good and evil.": "除了与最亲密的盟友组成的团体外，Thri-kreen几乎没有社会结构。复杂的社会行为规则的概念对他们来说是陌生的。他们几乎总是混沌的，在善与恶的问题上往往是中立的。",
	"You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线下看东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中看东西就像昏暗光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Thri-Kreen have powerful legs, allowing for jumps that many other humanoids consider impossible. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made when jumping. You do not need a running start to perform a long jump or high jump.": "Thri-Kreen的腿很有力，可以进行许多其他人类认为不可能的跳跃。你在跳跃时对力量（竞技）的检查有优势。你不需要跑动就能完成跳远或跳高。",
	"You have four arms with which to hold things. Two of them are smaller minor arms, and cannot hold shields or attack with weapons. The minor arms may manipulate objects and perform the somatic components of spells. These extra arms do not grant extra attacks beyond those which you are normally granted. Finally, you may interact with an additional object (like drawing or stowing something) each turn.": "你有四条手臂，可以用来拿东西。其中两只是较小的小臂，不能拿盾牌或用武器攻击。小臂可以操纵物体，并执行法术的身体部分。这些额外的手臂并不授予你通常所授予的额外攻击。最后，你可以在每一回合与一个额外的物体互动（比如画画或存放东西）。",
	"You don't require sleep to function. As such, magic can't put you to sleep. You still must take long rests and can perform nothing more than a light task during said rest.": "你不需要睡眠来运作。因此，魔法无法使你入睡。你仍然必须进行长时间的休息，并且在上述休息期间只能执行轻微的任务。",
	"You can comprehend, read, and write Common, and can speak Thri-Kreen. Thri-Kreen is a language that is seemingly wordless, where thoughts and ideas are conveyed through specific clacking of mandibles, waving of antennae, and gesturing of hands. Only thri-kreen have the physical features necessary to speak the language properly.": "你能理解、阅读和书写普通话，并能说Thri-Kreen语。Thri-Kreen是一种看似无字的语言，思想和观点通过下颚的具体咔哒声、触角的挥舞和手势来传达。只有Thri-Kreen有必要的身体特征来正确地讲这种语言。",
	"You are proficient with both the Gythka and Chatkcha. They are Martial weapons, and you may take them as starting equipment if your class allows you to take a martial weapon normally.": "你可以熟练使用Gythka和Chatkcha。它们是武术武器，如果你的等级允许你正常携带武术武器，你可以把它们作为起始装备。",
	"Your carapace is thicker and more resilient than that of other thri-kreen. When you aren't wearing armor, your armor class equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You cannot wear heavy armor due to your unusual anatomy.": "你的甲壳比其他Thri-Green的甲壳更厚、更有弹性。当你不穿盔甲时，你的盔甲等级等于12+你的灵巧修正值。由于你不寻常的解剖结构，你不能穿重甲。",
	"You secrete a resin-like saliva called dasl. This saliva can be used to create a variety of slashing and piercing weapons. During a long rest, you may use your dasl to create one gythka, spear, or javelin from an existing quarterstaff, as well as maximum of 5 chatkchas or daggers. Dasl weapons are very fragile, and must be remade every 24 hours to maintain effectiveness. A non thri-kreen character is not proficient with dasl weapons. When you roll a 1 on an attack made with a dasl weapon, the weapon shatters and becomes unusable. dasl gythkas, spears, and javelins that shatter in this way become ordinary quarterstaves.": "你会分泌一种类似于树脂的唾液，叫做dasl。这种唾液可以用来制造各种切割和穿刺武器。在长时间的休息中，你可以用你的达斯尔从现有的四分法杖中制造出一把GYTHKA、长矛或标枪，以及最多5把CHATKCHA或匕首。达斯尔武器非常脆弱，必须每24小时重新制作一次以保持其有效性。非Thri-Kreen角色不精通Dasl武器。当你在使用达斯尔武器的攻击中掷出1时，该武器就会碎裂并无法使用。达斯尔匕首、长矛和标枪如果以这种方式碎裂，就会变成普通的四分仪。",
	"You can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your natural surroundings as a bonus action. Once changed, your camouflage lasts until your next short or long rest and grants you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in the matched terrain. Moving out of the matched terrain, such as by moving indoors or by moving to an area with different vegetation or rocks (usually any area over 100 feet from where you first camouflaged), you lose this advantage. You cannot wear heavy armor due to your unusual anatomy.": "你可以改变你甲壳的颜色，以配合你周围自然环境的颜色和纹理，作为一个额外的动作。一旦改变，你的伪装就会持续到你的下一次短期或长期休息，并使你在匹配地形中进行的灵巧（隐身）检查中获得优势。如果你离开了匹配的地形，例如在室内移动或者移动到一个有不同植被或岩石的区域（通常是距离你第一次伪装的地方超过100英尺的任何区域），你就会失去这个优势。由于你不寻常的解剖结构，你不能穿重甲。",
	"You know the mage hand cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast blur (targeting only yourself) once per day with this ability. When you reach 5th level, you may also cast magic weapon once per day.": "你知道法师之手的咒语。一旦你达到3级，你可以用这个能力每天施放一次模糊术（只针对你自己）。当你达到5级时，你也可以每天施放一次魔法武器。"
