The object becomes proportionate to you, and can be used by you as if you were a Medium sized creature interacting with the object at its regular scale. Other rules for being sized Tiny may still apply to using this object. Shrinking an object does not reduce its weight. Faeries can use this ability to don armor or use weapons or items made for other races. If an item affected by this ability leaves your person, it remains shrunken for 1 round before returning to full size. If there is not room enough for the object to grow, it is first shunted to the closest available space that will allow it to return to full size.": "当你与一个中型生物可以用一只手握住或举起的50磅或以下的无人看管的物体互动时，你可以神奇地将该物体缩小到适合你使用的大小。该物体变得与你相称，并且可以被你使用，就像你是一个中等体型的生物在与该物体的正常比例互动一样。其他关于体型小的规则仍然适用于使用这个物体。缩小一个物体并不减少它的重量。精灵可以使用这个能力来穿戴盔甲或使用为其他种族制造的武器或物品。如果受此能力影响的物品离开你的身体，它在恢复到全尺寸之前会保持收缩1轮。如果没有足够的空间让物品变大，它首先会被分流到最近的可用空间，使其恢复到全尺寸。",
