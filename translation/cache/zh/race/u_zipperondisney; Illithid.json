	"Illithids fully complete ceremorphosis by the age of 9, and have become fully mature by age 15. Illithids live longer than humans, but rarely past 150 years.": "伊利斯人在9岁时完全完成了蜕变，15岁时已经完全成熟。伊利特人的寿命比人类长，但很少超过150岁。",
	"Illithids normally have a natural tendency towards hierarchy, discipline, and cruelty, and most have an alignment of lawful evil.": "伊利特人通常有一种天然的等级制度、纪律和残忍的倾向，而且大多数人的取向是合法的邪恶。",
	"Most illithids are at least as tall as humans, most standing a few inches over six feet, but their bodies very slender and emaciated, weighing much less than an average being of their stature. Your size is Medium.": "大多数illithids至少和人类一样高，大多数人的身高超过六英尺，但他们的身体非常苗条和憔悴，体重比他们身材的平均水平低得多。你的体型是中等。",
	"Your base walking speed is 30 feet.": "你的基本行走速度是30英尺。",
	"You have {@sense darkvision} up to a range of 60 feet. You can see in dim light as if it were bright light, but can't see colors, only shades of gray.": "你有{@sense darkvision}至多60英尺的范围。你可以在昏暗的光线下看到如同亮光一样的东西，但看不到颜色，只能看到灰色的阴影。",

	"Though significantly weaker without the full power of the mind flayers' collective networked intelligence behind them, lone illithids' mental assaults are still dangerous. You can loose a wave of psionic energy against a creature you can see as an action. The target must make a Intelligence saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus or take {@damage 1d8} psychic damage. At 6th level this damage increases to {@damage 2d8} and at 11th level the target is {@condition stunned} for one round. Once you use this feature you must finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest} to use it again.": "虽然在没有掠夺者的集体网络智能的全部力量支持下，孤独的幻术师的精神攻击仍然很危险。你可以对你能看到的生物释放一波幻觉能量作为行动。目标必须做一个智力救赎，DC等于8+你的智力修饰+你的熟练度加成，否则就会受到（%0%）精神伤害。在6级时，这个伤害增加到{@damage 2d8}，在11级时，目标会受到{@condition stunned}，持续一回合。一旦你使用这个功能，你必须完成一个{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}才能再次使用它。",
	"You can use your powerful tentacles to pull a foe's head closer to your mouth. If a creature starts its turn {@condition grappled} by you, it takes {@damage 1d4} psychic damage. If a humanoid {@condition grappled} by you is reduced to 0 hit points, you may kill it by extracting and devouring its brain. When eating a creatures brain, you learn some of its memories or recent thoughts of the DM's choosing.": "你可以用你强大的触手将敌人的头拉近你的嘴。如果一个生物在你身边开始它的回合（%0%），它会受到（%1%）精神伤害。如果在你身边的一个人形生物（2%）的生命值降至0，你可以通过提取和吞噬其大脑来杀死它。当吃掉一个生物的大脑时，你会学到它的一些记忆或最近的想法，由DM选择。",
	"You can speak, read, and write {@language Common} and {@language Undercommon}, and can write {@language Qualith|VGM}. You can also communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 120 feet of you, and prefer to do so as speaking aloud is unnatural and difficult for you.": "你可以说、读、写（%0%）和（%1%），可以写（%2%）。你也可以与你周围120英尺内的任何生物进行心灵感应，而且更愿意这样做，因为大声说话对你来说是不自然的，而且很困难。",
	"On the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write something down, they do so in {@language Qualith|VGM}. This system of tactile writing (similar to braille) is read  by an illithid's tentacles. {@language Qualith|VGM} is written in four-line stanzas and is so alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic to discern its meaning. Though {@language Qualith|VGM} can be used to keep records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instructions.": "在极少的情况下，如果心灵传播者需要写下一些东西，他们会用（%0%）来写。这种触觉书写系统（类似于盲文）可以通过illithid的触手阅读。{@language Qualith|VGM}是用四行诗句写成的，其结构非常奇怪，以至于非illithid人必须借助魔法来辨别其含义。虽然{@language Qualith|VGM}可以用来保存记录，但伊里特人最常使用它来标记门户或其他表面的警告或指示。",
	"{@creature Mind Flayer|MM|Mind flayers, also called illithids}, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds. Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near. In eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the {@race githyanki|MPMM} and {@race githzerai|MPMM}, the {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}, and the {@creature kuo-toa|MM}. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.": "{@creature Mind Flayer|MM|Mind flayers, also called illithids}，是无数世界上有生命的生物的祸害。幻觉暴君、奴隶主和跨维航行者，他们是阴险的主谋，为了自己扭曲的目的收割整个种族。四条触手从它们章鱼般的头部蜿蜒而出，当有生命的生物靠近时，它们会饥渴地弯曲。在过去的岁月里，伊里特人控制着横跨许多世界的帝国。他们征服并因此扭曲了整个人形奴隶种族，包括（1%）和（2%）、（3%）和（4%）。在集体意识的驱使下，伊利希德人以其深不可测的头脑策划了影响深远的邪恶计划。",

	"Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as {@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes}, {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}, {@creature quaggoth|MM|quaggoths}, and {@creature ogre|MM|ogres}. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.": "心灵飞翔者拥有幻觉能力，使他们能够控制生物的心灵，如（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）和（%3%）。伊利特人喜欢通过心灵感应进行交流，并在向他们的王族发布命令时使用他们的心灵感应。",
	"When an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind fayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.": "当Illithid遇到强大的抵抗时，它就会避免最初的战斗，因为它命令它的王室成员去攻击。就像Illithid思想的物理延伸一样，这些王室成员穿插在弑心者和它的敌人之间，牺牲自己的生命，让他们的主人能够逃脱。",
	"Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an {@creature elder brain|VGM}—a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind fayer community. From its pool, an {@creature elder brain|VGM} telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind fayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.": "孤独的心智飞翔者很可能是流氓和弃儿。大多数Illithids属于一个由兄弟姐妹组成的心智飞扬者群落，他们献身于一个（%0%）--一个巨大的类似大脑的生物，居住在靠近心智飞扬者社区中心的一个盐水池中。从它的池子里，(1%)心灵感应地将它的愿望告诉周围5英里内的每一个心智飞扬者，因为它能够同时进行多个精神对话。",
	"Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.": "伊利特人以人类的大脑为生。大脑提供他们生存所需的酶、激素和精神能量。从富含大脑的饮食中获得健康的伊利希德人，会分泌一层薄薄的粘液，涂抹在其淡紫色的皮肤上。",
	"An illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an {@creature intellect devourer}.": "一个illithid在吞噬一个人形生物的大脑时，会体验到欣快感，同时还有它的记忆、个性和内心深处的恐惧。噬心者有时会收获一个大脑，而不是吞噬它，把它作为一些外星实验的一部分，或者把它转化为一个（%0%）。"
