	"Chiroptera (also known as bainligors) are small, flightless bat-people. Their primitive tribal culture is found in the upper reaches of the Underdark, natural caverns, and abandoned subterranean dwellings or mine-works. Primarily carnivorous, they eat insects, larger animals that they hunt on the surface, and edible fungi. Their ears are huge, pointed, and fantastically sensitive; their noses and elaborately sculpted facial features are those of bats. They have disproportionately long fingers lightly webbed with the remnants of their wings. They are not blind, though their eyes are quite weak, and must be protected by heavily-tinted glasses or goggles in daylight lest they be utterly blinded. Their primary sense is hearing, which is so sensitive they can hear a pin drop three hundred yards away. Though chiroptera can speak any language, their native tongue is too high-pitched for others to hear, consisting entirely of ultrasonic squeaks that other races can only produce via magical or artificial means. Even if one speaks in a voice low enough to be heard by other races, its voice remains a high-pitched squeak.": "Chiroptera（也被称为bainligors）是小型的、不会飞的蝙蝠人。他们的原始部落文化在暗黑世界的上游、天然洞穴和废弃的地下住宅或矿井工程中被发现。他们主要是肉食动物，吃昆虫、他们在地面上猎取的较大的动物，以及可食用的真菌。它们的耳朵巨大、尖锐，而且非常敏感；它们的鼻子和精心雕琢的面部特征是蝙蝠的特征。它们有不成比例的长手指，上面有翅膀的残余物。他们不是盲人，尽管他们的眼睛相当脆弱，在白天必须用厚厚的有色眼镜或护目镜保护，以免他们完全失明。它们的主要感官是听觉，它是如此敏感，以至于它们可以听到300码外的针落地声。虽然千手观音可以说任何语言，但他们的母语音调太高，别人听不到，完全是由其他种族只能通过魔法或人工手段产生的超声波尖叫声组成。即使一个人用足够低的声音说话，其他种族也能听到，其声音仍然是高调的尖叫声。",
	"Though often maligned by humans, who sometimes call them \"night terrors\" or bainligor, the chiroptera are actually a generally peaceful race. No one—not even the chiroptera themselves—know the origins of their race, but scholars who have delved into the subject believe them to be the descendants of several common bat species \"awakened\" to sapience via magic; though who did so, for what reason, and even when are unknown. The chiroptera are often associated with the Underdark and the dread creatures therein, but in reality, they live in fear and disgust of the Deep Dark because and are frequently preyed upon by monsters, drow, and other denizens of the underground.": "虽然经常被人类恶意诋毁，有时还称他们为 \"夜惊 \"或bainligor，但实际上千手观音是一个普遍和平的种族。没有人--甚至螭吻兽自己--知道他们种族的起源，但是研究过这个问题的学者认为他们是几个普通蝙蝠物种的后代，通过魔法 \"唤醒 \"了他们的智慧；尽管谁这么做了，出于什么原因，甚至什么时候都不知道。翼手党经常与暗黑世界和其中的可怕生物联系在一起，但实际上，他们生活在对暗黑深处的恐惧和厌恶之中，因为他们经常被怪物、乌鸦和其他地下居民所捕杀。",
	"Chiroptera society is tribal, with each tribe consisting of no more than twenty or thirty individuals led by a matriarch—almost always the oldest female in the tribe. Every night, the entire tribe—including children—venture forth from their hearth-caves to hunt game. Lacking any knowledge of metallurgy, chiroptera usually hunt using bows with a stone-tipped arrow and well-made stone hand-axes, though tribes living near communities of other races will often trade meat and hides for metal weapons–especially throwing daggers, with which they display a terrifying proficiency. Though their natural society is primitive, chiroptera are just as intelligent as other humanoid races. Perhaps because of their supposed sorcerous origin, they tend to view scholarly magic with great distrust and do not like to handle magical artifacts or associate with practitioners of magic unless they absolutely have to. Innate or \"natural\" magic comes easily to them, though, especially elemental magic. They utterly despise drow, who routinely prey upon their populations, and are not fond of elves either. Relationships with dwarves, svirfneblin, and other non-evil subterranean races vary widely, though they are usually peaceful and based on trade or hunting pacts. Most chiroptera adventures have left their native tribes behind at a young age, often exiled for unwise acts or orphaned by drow slaver attacks; though, like every other race, there are individuals who set forth from home just to experience the wide world beyond their hearth-caves. Because of their nocturnal nature, unparalleled hearing, and deftness with bows and daggers, many chiroptera adventurers become rogues or rangers. They make superb assassins, though their generally good natures mean that they only target evil-doers; as such, many belong to organizations like the Harpers that are dedicated to curbing evil by subtle means. Tribal chiroptera believe very strongly in self-reliance and do not natively worship–or even acknowledge %ndash; any gods. Those living among other races often find the concept of worshipping higher powers to be silly at best, and dangerous at worst, as doing so goes against their native culture's greatest tenet: depend only on yourself and those around you. Chiroptera are not swift to make friends with persons of other races, but once they do they are fiercely protective and dependable.": "蜥蜴人社会是部落式的，每个部落由不超过20或30个人组成，由一个族长领导--几乎总是部落中最年长的女性。每天晚上，整个部落--包括儿童--都要从他们的壁炉洞里出来打猎。由于缺乏任何冶金知识，千手观音通常使用带有石尖箭的弓和制作精良的石质手斧进行狩猎，尽管生活在其他种族社区附近的部落经常会用肉和皮来换取金属武器--特别是投掷匕首，他们对投掷匕首的熟练程度令人惊异。虽然他们的自然社会是原始的，但千手观音和其他类人种族一样聪明。也许是因为他们被认为是巫师的起源，他们倾向于以极大的不信任来看待学术性的魔法，并且不喜欢处理魔法文物或与魔法从业者交往，除非他们绝对必要。不过，天生或 \"自然 \"的魔法对他们来说很容易，尤其是元素魔法。他们完全鄙视鸦人，因为鸦人经常掠夺他们的人口，而且也不喜欢精灵。他们与矮人、斯维尔芬布林和其他非邪恶的地下种族的关系差异很大，尽管他们通常是和平的，基于贸易或狩猎协议。大多数千手观音冒险者在年轻的时候就离开了他们的本土部落，他们常常因为不理智的行为而被流放，或者因为鸦人奴隶的袭击而成为孤儿；不过，像其他种族一样，也有一些人从家里出发，只是为了体验他们炉灶之外的广阔世界。由于他们的夜行性，无与伦比的听力，以及对弓箭和匕首的熟练运用，许多千手观音冒险家成为了流氓或游侠。他们是极好的刺客，尽管他们普遍善良的天性意味着他们只针对邪恶的人；因此，许多人属于像哈珀斯这样的组织，致力于通过微妙的手段来遏制邪恶。部落的千手观音非常相信自力更生，不崇拜--甚至不承认任何神灵。那些生活在其他种族中的人经常发现崇拜更高的力量的概念，往好了说是愚蠢的，往坏了说是危险的，因为这样做违背了他们本土文化的最大信条：只依靠自己和周围的人。千手观音不会轻易与其他种族的人交朋友，但一旦他们交了朋友，就会有强烈的保护意识和依赖性。",
