Deinony serve their people as ambassadors and traveling merchants. Plesios are depended on as farmers and explorers of saurian society. Pteradas are known for their creativity and expertise as artisans. Sarchos are found almost exclusively in coastal cities and often make up whatever naval forces a saurian citystate has.

	"Saurians tower over other humanoid races. The size of the saurian race is proof, saurians say, of their mandate of rulership over the younger races and their connection to the primordial origins of the world. When their foot falls shake the earth and echo off the hills, even the skeptical are inclined to give their point consideration.": "萨乌尔人比其他人形种族高大。萨乌尔人说，萨乌尔人的体型证明了他们对年轻种族的统治权以及他们与世界原始起源的联系。当他们的脚步声震动大地，在山丘上回响时，即使是持怀疑态度的人也会倾向于考虑他们的观点。",

	"The reign of the saurians was long but so far in the distant past that none but their own scholars even recall the details of it. In the modern age, saurians remain in ancient, gilded cities deep in the forgotten places of the world.

Even as their numbers grow fewer with each passing decade, saurians still look to the past rather than embrace the future.": "萨乌尔人的统治是漫长的，但在遥远的过去，除了他们自己的学者，甚至没有人记得其中的细节。在现代，萨乌尔人仍然留在世界上被遗忘的地方深处的古老、镀金的城市里。隐藏在这些被时间遗忘的土地上，萨乌尔人仍然致力于他们祖先的文化和传统。即使他们的人数随着时间的推移越来越少，萨乌尔人仍然期待着过去而不是拥抱未来。",
	"In that bygone age, the saurian people ruled sprawling empires from capitols littered with gold and precious gems, enlightened by the doctrine of their religious philosophy, and pioneered a great number of the mundane and mystical arts practiced today. At least, that's what the saurians claim. With their numbers shrinking since before recorded time, some saurians embrace a fatalistic stance that their race was born dying.": "在那个逝去的时代，萨乌尔人从堆满黄金和宝石的国会大厦统治着庞大的帝国，在他们的宗教哲学教义的启迪下，开创了今天大量的世俗的和神秘的艺术。至少，这是萨乌尔人的说法。随着他们的数量在有记载的时间之前就开始萎缩，一些萨乌尔人接受了一种宿命论的立场，认为他们的种族生来就会死亡。",
	"Saurians are an isolationist and monocultural people and have been for the length of recorded history. When a saurian becomes an adventurer, they leave the highly structured society they come from and embrace a world of dizzying freedom. A saurian might take this dramatic leap because they reject the caste they've been born into, they've committed a great crime, or they're the last survivor of a once great city-state. Whatever the reason, saurians typically know little of the customs of other people and often struggle to adopt new ways of thinking.": "萨乌尔人是一个孤立主义和单一文化的民族，在有记载的历史长河中一直如此。当萨乌尔人成为一个冒险家时，他们离开了他们来自的高度结构化的社会，拥抱了一个令人眩晕的自由世界。一个萨乌尔人可能因为拒绝了他们出生的种姓，他们犯了大罪，或者他们是一个曾经伟大的城邦的最后幸存者而采取这种戏剧性的飞跃。不管是什么原因，萨乌尔人通常对其他民族的习俗知之甚少，而且往往难以采用新的思维方式。",
