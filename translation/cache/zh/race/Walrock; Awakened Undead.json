	"Death comes for all things in a near-infinite variety of ways. So, too, are there many reasons that the dead might return from the grave. Directly-applied necromancy, cursed lands, and unfinished business are but a few, and all leave the newly-undead soul with a mere semblance of the life it had before. All undead carry the physical or emotional scars of what ended their mortal lives, though some may be far more subtle than others.": "死亡以近乎无限的方式降临于万物。因此，也有许多原因使死者可能从坟墓中返回。直接应用死灵法术、被诅咒的土地和未完成的事业只是其中的几个，所有这些都让新的亡灵的灵魂只剩下它之前的生活的影子。所有的亡灵都带着结束其凡人生活的身体或情感上的伤痕，尽管有些伤痕可能比其他伤痕要细微得多。",
	"Typically having no lands to call their own, undead with an awakened sense of self are usually perpetual foreigners, wanders in a land and often a time they do not belong to. Compounding matters, most mortal cultures carry with them an instinctual fear of death and the dead, and many associate necromancy specifically with dark tidings. This forms a wall of (often well-earned) prejudice and hatred that sentient undead find themselves up against, and many undead choose to hide their necrotic natures behind clothes, masks, and pungent perfumes when journeying into civilization.": "通常情况下，由于没有自己的土地，自我意识觉醒的亡灵通常是永久的异乡人，在他们不属于的土地和时间里游荡。更为复杂的是，大多数凡人的文化都带有对死亡和死者的本能恐惧，许多人将死灵法术与黑暗的预言联系起来。这形成了一堵有生命的亡灵发现自己所面对的偏见和仇恨的墙（往往是得来不易的），许多亡灵在进入文明社会时选择将他们的亡灵本性隐藏在衣服、面具和刺鼻的香水后面。",
	"Depending on composition, humanoid undead typically range a wide gamut from 20 to 300 pounds, and may possess empty eyes, a colored flame-like magical animus in their sockets, or harrowed, surprisingly mortal eyes burning with an inner fire. Hair (if they have it at all) is usually lank, dark, and wrought with grime and gravedirt that no amount of cleaning will fully remove.": "根据组成的不同，人形亡灵的范围很广，从20磅到300磅不等，可能拥有空洞的眼睛，眼窝里有彩色的火焰状的魔力，或者有耙子，令人惊讶的凡人的眼睛燃烧着内在的火焰。头发（如果他们有的话）通常是松散的、深色的，并带有污垢和坟墓的痕迹，无论怎样清洗都无法完全去除。",
	"Undeath is effectively immortality, a strong reason why many mortal spellcasters of a certain moral bent consider it a viable alternative to actually dying. Still, it is not immortality without a price; senses and emotions dull, food and drink no longer have taste, and often an undead state comes alongside a subservience of will and unthinking toil beneath a merciless and malevolent master.": "不死之身实际上是不朽的，这也是许多具有某种道德倾向的凡人施法者认为它是比真正的死亡更可行的选择的有力理由。然而，这并不是没有代价的不死之身；感官和情感会变钝，食物和饮料不再有味道，而且不死状态往往伴随着意志的屈从和在一个无情和恶意的主人手下不假思索的劳作。",
	"Some undead are born into freedom, while others earn it or have it thrust upon them. Regardless, all undead that are not bound greatly cherish their liberday, as the reminders of what could easily happen were they not fortunate enough to possess free will abound throughout history. Many awakened undead consider it their sacred duty to free other mindless undead, or simply to dispatch them wherever they may be found. The reasoning is straightforward enough: a final rest awarded to all mortals is greatly preferential to eternal slavery to the likes of a short-sighted, megalomaniacal spellcaster.": "有些亡灵生来就有自由，而有些亡灵则是靠自己的努力获得自由，或者是被强加给他们。不管怎么说，所有没有被束缚的亡灵都非常珍惜他们的自由，因为在历史上，如果他们没有足够幸运地拥有自由意志，很容易就会发生这样的事情。许多觉醒的亡灵认为解放其他无意识的亡灵是他们的神圣职责，或者干脆把他们赶到任何可能发现的地方。道理很简单：让所有凡人得到最后的安息，比让一个目光短浅、自大狂的施法者永世为奴要好得多。",
	"For many awakened undead, the past is a distant homeland to which they may never return, holding names and faces now partially-forgotten, and loves and lives as dead as they are. The anguish of this loss is enough to drive many mad, but others use this rage and pain as a source of power and drive, carrying them further on the road to whatever dark destiny awaits.": "对于许多苏醒的亡灵来说，过去是他们可能永远无法返回的遥远家园，那里有现在部分被遗忘的名字和面孔，以及和他们一样死去的爱和生活。这种损失的痛苦足以使许多人发疯，但也有人将这种愤怒和痛苦作为力量和动力的来源，带着他们在通往任何黑暗命运的道路上走得更远。",
	"Frequently, entire countries, customs, and cultures an undead may be familiar with no longer exist, and the sentient dead behaves or speaks in an antiquated fashion because of this. These undead may find it more difficult than usual to relate to modern mortals, usually leveraging what companions they find to bridge this epoch-long communication gap.": "通常，亡灵可能熟悉的整个国家、习俗和文化都已不复存在，而有知觉的亡灵也因此以一种过时的方式行事或说话。这些亡灵可能会发现比平时更难与现代凡人相处，通常会利用他们找到的同伴来弥合这个时代的交流差距。",
	"Many undead that awaken into sentience prefer to keep the names they held in their mortal lives. For others, however, their mortal names are forgotten or have lost meaning. These undead often adopt nicknames given to them by their former masters or present companions, and hold them to be as true as any other creature's birth name.": "许多觉醒的亡灵喜欢保留他们在凡人生活中的名字。然而对其他人来说，他们凡人的名字已经被遗忘或失去了意义。这些亡灵经常采用他们以前的主人或现在的同伴给他们起的绰号，并认为它们和其他生物的出生名字一样真实。",
	"Examples of names given in this fashion can be seen, below:": "以下是以这种方式命名的例子。",
	"Bane, Carver, Clatter, Crumble, Drudge, Minion, Mort, Pale, Rattlebones, Raven, Rook, Rotface, Shade, Shiver, Spore, Wisp": "Bane, Carver, Clatter, Crumble, Drudge, Minion, Mort, Pale, Rattlebones, Raven, Rook, Rotface, Shade, Shiver, Spore, Wisp",
	"Death doesn't have to be the end for a player character. An interested DM may allow a dead character to rise from their grave as one of the awakened undead, replacing the character's race and subrace features with those listed here, and taking on the character's former race as the new undead's Past Life.": "死亡不一定是玩家角色的终点。有兴趣的DM可以让死去的角色从坟墓中复活，成为被唤醒的亡灵之一，用这里列出的特征取代该角色的种族和亚种特征，并将该角色以前的种族作为新亡灵的前世。",
	"Conversely, an awakened undead character can wish to regain their mortal life. This may only be achieved through the use of the true resurrection spell and, again, DM permission. A character returning to their mortal life replaces their awakened undead race and subrace with what they chose for their Past Life feature, loses all features and abilities associated with being an awakened undead and instead gains abilities typical for a member of their new race.": "相反，被唤醒的亡灵角色可以希望重获他们的凡人生命。这只能通过使用真正的复活咒语来实现，并且同样需要DM的许可。回到凡人生活的角色会用他们选择的前世特征取代他们的觉醒亡灵种族和亚种，失去所有与觉醒亡灵相关的特征和能力，而获得新种族成员的典型能力。",
	"Many awakened undead cling to the alignment they held in life. For others, death changes them significantly, and they adopt a new worldview in light ofwhat their death has taught them.": "许多苏醒的亡灵坚持他们生前的排列组合。对其他人来说，死亡使他们发生了很大的变化，他们根据死亡的教训采取了新的世界观。",
	"You do not age. Given time, the necromantic energies that sustain you will heal most wounds you take at approximately the same rate as a mortal, and your hit dice function as normal.": "你不会衰老。只要有时间，维持你的死灵能量会以与凡人大致相同的速度治愈你所受的大部分创伤，你的命中率也会如常运作。",
	"Choose another race besides this one, which must be humanoid and lack the Living Construct trait (or similar). Before your death, you were a member of this race and appear as an undead version of it.": "在这个种族之外选择另一个种族，这个种族必须是人形的，并且缺乏活体构造的特性（或类似的特性）。在你死亡之前，你是这个种族的成员，并以其不死版本的身份出现。",
	"Your size, height, and movement speed are the same as a typical member of that race. You do not retain special movement speeds from this race (such as swimming or flying) or any of the race's other racial traits. If your Past Life race has subraces, you can select one, but it confers no benefits.": "你的体型、身高和移动速度与该种族的典型成员相同。你不保留该种族的特殊移动速度（如游泳或飞行）或该种族的任何其他种族特征。如果你的前世种族有子种族，你可以选择一个，但它不会带来任何好处。",
	"You have been raised from death, but regaining your autonomy has returned to you some of the spark of life. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.": "你已经从死亡中复活，但重新获得自主权使你重新获得了一些生命的火花。你对疾病有免疫力。你不需要吃或呼吸，但如果你愿意，你可以摄取食物和饮料。",
	"Additionally, you have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types.": "此外，你有两种生物类型：人形和亡灵。如果一个法术或能力对你的任何一种生物类型有效，你就能受到它的影响。",
	"As an undead, you very rarely tire. You treat {@condition exhaustion} as if it was one level less. In addition, instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.": "作为一个亡灵，你很少会疲倦。你把{@condition exhaustion}当作是少了一个等级。此外，你不是在睡觉，而是每天进入4小时的不活动状态。在这种状态下你不会做梦；你完全意识到你周围的环境，并像平常一样注意到接近的敌人和其他事件。",
	"Unlike other undead, you can be restored through healing magic, but it has a significantly dampened effect on you. When you regain hit points from a source that specifies it does not function on undead, you only receive half as many hit points as the source would normally provide, rounded down.": "与其他亡灵不同，你可以通过治疗魔法进行恢复，但它对你的影响明显减弱。当你从一个指定不对亡灵起作用的来源恢复命中率时，你只能得到该来源通常提供的一半命中率，向下取整。",
	"Through the necromantic energy animating you, you are able to perceive with greater clarity that which lurks in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "通过赋予你活力的死灵能量，你能够更清晰地感知潜伏在黑暗中的东西。你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线中看到，就像亮光一样，而在黑暗中就像暗光一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"You are immune to poison damage and the {@condition poisoned} condition.": "你对毒药伤害和{@condition poisoned}条件免疫。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language, typically one available to the race you chose for your Past Life. If your Past Life race has a trait that precludes speech (such as a kenku's Mimicry), you are still not able to speak and instead gain access to the relevant trait of your Past Life race that substitutes speech.": "你可以说、读、写普通话和其他一种语言，通常是你为你的前世所选择的种族可以使用的一种语言。如果你的前世种族有排除语言的特质（如Kenku的Mimicry），你仍然不能说话，而是获得你前世种族的相关特质来替代语言。",
	"The undead presented in this option are intended to be easily accessible to players, and thus have features players would expect from other races. They can be magically healed (albeit at a reduced rate), and affected by spells such as {@spell charm person} or {@spell hold person}.": "本选项中介绍的亡灵是为了让玩家容易接触到，因此具有玩家对其他种族所期望的特征。他们可以被魔法治愈（尽管治愈率降低），并受到（%0%）或（%1%）等法术的影响。",
	"However, you or your DM can choose to make awakened undead into fully undead characters. If this is the case, your Living Dead trait does not grant the humanoid type, and you do not have the Unholy trait.": "然而，你或你的管理员可以选择将觉醒的亡灵变成完全的亡灵角色。如果是这种情况，你的 \"活死人 \"特质就不会被赋予人形类型，而且你也没有 \"邪恶 \"特质。",
	"This option increases the difficulty for an undead character, as well as that character's reliance on hit dice and spells such as {@spell goodberry} or {@spell regenerate} that do not exclude undead. Playing a fully undead character may be too much for novice players, but a veteran player could enjoy the challenge.": "这个选项增加了亡灵角色的难度，以及该角色对不排除亡灵的命中率和法术的依赖，如（%0%）或（%1%）。对于新手玩家来说，扮演一个完全不死的角色可能太难了，但老手玩家可以享受这种挑战。",
	"As an action on your turn, you can emit an unearthly wail that rattles the souls of your opponents. Each creature within 20 feet of you that is not an undead or construct must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma or Wisdom modifier (your choice). A creature that fails this saving throw takes psychic damage equal to {@dice 2d10} + your total character level, or half this amount on a success.": "在你的回合中，你可以发出一种不祥的哀号，使你的对手的灵魂受到震荡。每个在你20英尺范围内的非亡灵或构造物的生物都必须做一个 \"宪法救赎\"，DC为8+你的熟练度加成+你的魅力或智慧修改器（你选择）。失败的生物会受到相当于（%0%）+你总等级的精神伤害，如果成功，则会受到一半的伤害。",

	"Additionally, when a creature within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points and dies, you can feed upon the power of their death to gain your choice of one of the following benefits:": "此外，当一个在你30英尺范围内的生物被降低到0命中率并死亡时，你可以借助他们死亡的力量来获得你所选择的以下一种好处。",
	"You gain temporary hit points equal to your total character level + your Constitution modifier, which last for up to one minute": "你获得相当于你的总角色等级+你的宪法修改器的临时命中率，持续时间最长为1分钟。",

You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Choose Wisdom or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for all three spells.": "你也学会了{@spell blink}和{@spell invisibility}的法术，每个法术你都可以在其最低的法术等级下施放一次而不需要消耗一个法术槽。当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得以这种方式施放这两个法术的能力。选择智慧或魅力作为你对所有三个法术的施法能力。",

Once the ritual is completed and you have made an object your phylactery, you cannot perform this ritual again until 300 days have passed.

If you are resurrected by some other means before this time, you do not reform via your phylactery.

Embalmed and wrapped in layers of treated linens scrawled with profane sigils, a mummy is gaunt and withered, yet shockingly powerful.
