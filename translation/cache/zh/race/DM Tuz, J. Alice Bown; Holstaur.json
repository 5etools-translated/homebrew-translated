Often only found high in the mountain regions, urbos are head strong and instinctually territorial.

They can often be found guiding travelers through the mountains, and have been known to rescue people from storms and wild beasts. They are willing to trust, just as they are willing to harm if that trust is broken.": "原始的亲属，所有holstaur物种的发源地，是牛人中最大和最强壮的。通常只在山区的高处发现，乌尔博斯的头部很强壮，并具有本能的领地性。与它们年轻的表亲不同，它们更容易发怒，但对那些无法保护自己的人拥有强烈的保护本能。他们经常被发现引导旅行者穿过山脉，并被称为从风暴和野兽中拯救人们。他们愿意信任，就像他们愿意在信任被破坏时伤害一样。",

	"The bards have told tales of this race‘s tendency for good-deeds and acts of kindness.

Some have assumed an ancestral kinship with the hinotaur's, but no distinct connection has ever been determined.": "吟游诗人讲述了这个种族的善行和仁慈行为的倾向。据说，只要有霍斯塔尔的存在就是一种祝福，他们经常被社区张开双臂欢迎。霍斯塔尔人和他们的许多亚种起源于何处尚不清楚。有些人认为他们与希诺陶洛斯有祖先的亲属关系，但至今还没有确定明确的联系。",
	"Despite their friendly reputation holstaurs rarely live among their own kin in settlements. They occasionally wander in groups of their own kind for migration, but these herds shrink over time as each member finds a new place to settle. This has made tracking holstaur culture difficult, as by their very nature they assimilate into whatever home they choose before moving on.": "尽管他们有着友好的声誉，但霍斯塔尔人很少在自己的亲属中定居。他们偶尔会在自己的族群中游荡迁徙，但随着时间的推移，这些族群会逐渐缩小，因为每个成员都会找到一个新的地方定居。这使得追踪Holstaur的文化变得很困难，因为根据他们的本性，他们在继续前行之前会被同化到他们选择的任何家庭中。",
	"Holstaurs are more commonly known to have gentle and benign dispositions. Possessing immense patience and calm heads. Most have a nurturing instinct that manifests in many different ways among different holstaurs. Be it a struggling grove, an animal in need, or a community under attack by evil-doers. No kindness is too small for a holstaur to consider. And once that kindness is accepted, holstaurs will become loyal to these they devote themselves to.": "众所周知，霍尔施塔特犬具有温柔和良性的性格。拥有巨大的耐心和冷静的头脑。大多数人都有一种养育的本能，在不同的Holstaurs中表现出许多不同的方式。无论是挣扎中的小树林，还是需要帮助的动物，或者是被邪恶分子攻击的社区。对Holstaur来说，任何善意都不会太小。而一旦这种善意被接受，holstaurs就会对他们所奉献的这些人变得忠诚。",
	"This has led some unfortunates to assume they are pushovers. A holstaurs will never start a fight, but will finish them. And for this race, benevolence is not always passive, or soft. Returning a holstaur's kindness with cruelty can have dire consequences if they deem ridding the world of you as a kindness.": "这导致一些不幸的人认为他们是推手。霍斯塔尔人从来不会挑起战斗，但会结束他们。对这个种族来说，仁慈并不总是被动的，或者是软弱的。如果他们认为把你赶出这个世界也是一种仁慈，那么以残忍的方式回报holstaur的仁慈会带来可怕的后果。",
	"A bond with a Holstaur can last for a lifetime — but more often does not. Once they have helped something become the best it can be, and there are no more in need of help, these cowfolk will often grow restless and bored of their surroundings. So they will move on. Because of this, holstaurs will often take nomadic partners who are willing to travel with them to different communities. By nature it's hard for them to ‘settle down' for life however, finding a place that will always need help with something is often the best compromise. Because of this, arcadians often stay in one area the longest.": "与Holstaur的联系可以持续一生--但更多的时候不是这样。一旦他们帮助一些东西成为最好的，而且没有更多需要帮助的人，这些牛人往往会变得不安，对周围的环境感到厌烦。所以他们会继续前进。正因为如此，holstaurs经常会找一些愿意和他们一起到不同社区旅行的游牧伙伴。从本质上讲，他们很难 \"定居 \"下来过日子，然而，找到一个永远需要帮助的地方，往往是最好的折衷办法。正因为如此，阿卡德人往往在一个地区停留的时间最长。",
	"As holstaurs do not possess their own language or more importantly, naming conventions, they are named in the same manner typical for the locale they were born in. But in one of the very few traditions they possess, specific suffixes are sometimes used to show individuality from local names. This often has the additional benefit for the holstaur to create as a fantastic opportunity to tell others of their upbringing upon introduction.": "由于Holstaurs没有自己的语言，更重要的是没有命名规则，他们的命名方式与他们出生地的典型方式相同。但在他们拥有的为数不多的传统中，有时会使用特定的后缀来显示与当地名字的个性。这通常有一个额外的好处，那就是为holstaur创造了一个绝好的机会，在介绍时告诉别人他们的成长经历。",
