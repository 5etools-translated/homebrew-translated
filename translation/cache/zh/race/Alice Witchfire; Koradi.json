	"A hush lulls over the deepest parts of the woods as a party of hunters tracks their unfortunate prey. Unbeknown to them, a slender, olive-skinned humanoid crouches on a tree branch, completely unnoticed. She carefully plans her every move in order to remain undetected by the hunters. Ears twitch and eyes squint as the koradi huntress slowly tracks behind the party, the hunters becoming the hunted.": "当一队猎人追踪他们不幸的猎物时，树林深处一片寂静。他们不知道，一个苗条的、橄榄色皮肤的人形生物蹲在树枝上，完全没有注意到。她仔细地计划着自己的每一个动作，以便不被猎人发现。耳朵抽动着，眼睛眯着，科拉迪女猎人慢慢地跟踪在队伍后面，猎人变成了被猎物。",
	"A firm grip embraces the curves of the bow she carved in her youth. It is well worn, but she knows it is reliable. As her feet weightlessly skim across tree bark, a foot knocks a loose branch, sending it tumbling down onto the carpeted floor. The hunters take notice and turn around to face her but before they can react, she is long gone.": "坚定地握住她年轻时雕刻的弓的曲线。它已被磨损，但她知道它是可靠的。当她的双脚失重地滑过树皮时，一只脚磕到了一根松动的树枝，使它滚落到铺有地毯的地板上。猎人注意到了，并转过身来面对她，但在他们做出反应之前，她已经走远了。",
	"Though koradi aren't plants themselves, their attunement with nature has given them biological traits similar to those of the plants they deem sacred. Koradi skin often takes earthen tones that deepen as they age to help them blend into the local lands. Eye colors vary greatly but are generally hazel or green in tint with an almond-shaped iris. Their hair ranges from common human tones to vibrant greens and misty whites. Those who are born with less exotic skin tones generally find an easier time assimilating with human society, though even the fairest-skinned koradi will have a noticeable tint.": "虽然科拉迪本身不是植物，但他们与自然的契合使他们具有与他们认为神圣的植物相似的生物特征。科拉迪人的皮肤通常是土黄色的，随着年龄的增长而加深，以帮助他们融入当地的土地。眼睛的颜色变化很大，但一般是淡褐色或绿色，有杏仁状的虹膜。他们的头发从普通人的色调到充满活力的绿色和缥缈的白色不等。那些天生肤色不那么奇特的人通常更容易与人类社会同化，尽管即使是皮肤最白的科拉迪也会有明显的色调。",
	"However, the most distinguishable feature of koradi lies in their more naturalistic elements. Koradi from the deep woods will have bark-like skin that resembles trees, while those from the swamp have amphibian-like skin. All koradi have various plant-like markings or growths over their bodies — sometimes symmetrical and sometimes not. These markings help the koradi blend in with the local lands and are used by outsiders to further differentiate them from one another. Koradi with the largest and most visible markings are held with the highest esteem among their community.": "然而，科拉迪最显著的特征在于其更多的自然元素。来自深山老林的科拉迪会有类似树皮的皮肤，而来自沼泽的则有类似两栖动物的皮肤。所有的科拉迪都有各种类似植物的斑纹或生长在他们的身体上--有时是对称的，有时不是。这些标记帮助科拉迪人融入当地的土地，并被外人用来进一步区分他们彼此。拥有最大和最明显标记的科拉迪在其社区中受到最高的尊重。",
	"While bearkin have only been around for a few generations their origin is surround in mystery. Most believe that they are the result of malevolent druidic rituals; The bearkin, it is said, upon achieving true sentinence did not obey, killed their masters and escaped.": "虽然Bearkin只存在了几代人，但他们的起源却充满了神秘感。大多数人认为他们是邪恶的德鲁伊仪式的结果；据说Bearkin在获得真正的地位后不服从命令，杀死了他们的主人并逃跑了。",
	"In bearkin families gathered around campfires, they tell scary tales of evil druid pacts and monsters that will come to take children who do not perform simple chores or behave, though no bearkin truly knows where they came from.": "在Bearkin家庭中，他们围着篝火，讲述邪恶的德鲁伊契约和怪物的可怕故事，这些怪物会来带走不做简单家务或不听话的孩子，尽管没有Bearkin人真正知道它们来自何处。",
	"Other theories of bearkin origins are less credible, such as their role as native guardians in the Feywilds escaped to the Material Plane after a war, or that they owe their creation to a pact made by an army of great warriors, given the bodies and strength of bears to dominate their enemies. Intelligent or scholarly bearkin often wish to discover this detail.": "其他关于bearkin起源的理论不太可信，比如他们在战争后作为Feywilds的本土守护者逃到了物质世界，或者他们的创造归功于一支伟大的战士军队的契约，他们被赋予熊的身体和力量来支配他们的敌人。聪明的或有学问的bearkin常常希望发现这个细节。",
	"Koradi are an extremely resourceful folk that often create the tools they need from materials found in their homeland. As they will almost never purposely harm a plant or tree, they instead gather these materials from tree limbs that have fallen due to a storm, or animals that perished due to natural causes. However, the bulk of their resource gathering comes from trading among their own clan and with neighboring koradi clans.": "科拉迪是一个非常机智的民族，他们经常用家乡的材料创造他们需要的工具。由于他们几乎不会故意伤害植物或树木，而是从因风暴而倒下的树枝或因自然原因而死亡的动物身上收集这些材料。然而，他们大部分的资源收集来自于他们自己的部族之间以及与邻近的科拉迪部族的交易。",
	"These resourceful folk tend to organize themselves into clans that support and protect each individual member. Any materials or wealth they obtain are usually shared among their clan, though koradi will still keep personal belongings of high importance to themselves. Koradi clans often revolve around one or two resources native to their homeland and will freely trade with other clans and the few creatures they trust, exchanging materials found in one region for those found in another.": "这些足智多谋的民间人士倾向于将自己组织成支持和保护每个成员的氏族。他们获得的任何材料或财富通常会在他们的部族中分享，尽管科拉迪仍然会把非常重要的个人物品留给自己。科拉迪氏族通常围绕着他们家乡的一两种原生资源，并会与其他氏族和他们信任的少数生物自由交易，用在一个地区发现的材料交换在另一个地区发现的东西。",
	"As creatures who thrive and live off of the land, koradi have an obligation to protect their homes from anyone who seeks to cause harm to them. Hunters who (often unknowingly) stumble into a koradi clan's territory must be extremely careful to avoid harming the environment so as to avoid being confronted by them. Harming a single koradi or sometimes even a single tree they hold sacred can cause the whole clan to turn against someone. On the other hand, koradi will guarantee safe passage through hazardous terrain to people who prove their alliance.": "作为以土地为生的生物，科拉迪有义务保护他们的家园，不让任何人对他们造成伤害。偶然进入科拉迪族领地的猎人（往往是在不知情的情况下）必须非常小心，避免伤害环境，以避免被他们撞见。伤害一个科拉迪人，有时甚至是他们认为神圣的一棵树，都可能导致整个部族与人反目。另一方面，科拉迪会保证证明其联盟关系的人安全通过危险的地形。",
	"Koradi are not greedy beings and will rarely perform tasks in exchange for money. They instead prefer to barter using goods and services. Because they often have to share their lands with good-aligned fey, they tend to have an instinctual trust for fey and fey-like creatures— especially with dryads and other woodland protectors. Koradi will usually stay away from half-orcs and dwarves, and will keep a close eye on any humans they encounter. But a koradi will be quick to trust a gnome or an elf. Regardless of race however, a koradi holds a creature's respect towards nature (or lack thereof) above all else. It is for this reason that the only humans that have ever gained the trust of a koradi clan have been druids or hermits.": "科拉迪人并不贪婪，很少会为了换取金钱而执行任务。他们更喜欢用货物和服务进行交换。因为他们经常要与善良的费伊人分享他们的土地，他们往往对费伊人和类似费伊人的生物有一种本能的信任--特别是对干尸和其他林地保护者。科拉迪通常会远离半兽人和矮人，并且会密切关注他们遇到的任何人类。但科拉迪会很快信任地精或精灵。然而，无论种族如何，科拉迪人对生物的自然尊重（或缺乏尊重）高于一切。正是由于这个原因，只有德鲁伊或隐士才获得过科拉迪族人的信任。",
	"Koradi are magical beings with a deep love for art, lore, and above all nature. Their equipment is expertly crafted from natural materials and is often expertly decorated with engravings and adornments. While many take up roles within their clan as dedicated farmers or healers, some will go on to train as silent trackers and warriors, perfecting their hunting and magical abilities in the process. Becoming a protector within your clan is viewed as a sign of great honor.": "科拉迪是一种神奇的生物，对艺术、传说、以及最重要的自然界有着深深的热爱。他们的装备是用天然材料专业制作的，并经常用雕刻和装饰品进行专业装饰。虽然许多人在他们的部族中担任专门的农民或治疗师的角色，但有些人将继续训练成为沉默的追踪者和战士，在这个过程中完善他们的狩猎和魔法能力。在你的部族中成为保护者被认为是一个巨大的荣誉的标志。",
	"Though few ever leave their clan and the local lands, the ones who leave the comfort of the woods may do so as a result of their natural curiosity, a desire for a better life, or sometimes even exile. They tend to put their skills to use in the outside world as sages, rangers, soldiers, herbalists, witch doctors, and sometimes even adventurers.": "虽然很少有人离开他们的部族和当地的土地，但那些离开舒适的森林的人可能是由于他们天生的好奇心，对更好的生活的渴望，有时甚至是流放。他们倾向于将自己的技能用于外面的世界，成为圣人、游侠、士兵、草药师、巫医，有时甚至是冒险家。",
	"Koradi know each other primarily through their distinct markings and role within their clan. They usually only have a single name assigned to them by either their grandparents or the clan elder. Most koradi names are sylvan in nature and resemble those of elves, gnomes, and other fey. They lack a formal last name and instead use their clan name when required. Koradi clan names are more often than not based off of the materials and resources found within their territory.": "科拉迪主要通过他们独特的标记和在部族中的角色来认识彼此。他们通常只有一个名字，由他们的祖父母或氏族长老指定。大多数科拉迪人的名字都具有精灵的性质，与精灵、地精和其他精灵的名字相似。他们没有正式的姓氏，而是在需要时使用他们的氏族名称。科拉迪氏族的名字往往是基于他们领地内发现的材料和资源。",
