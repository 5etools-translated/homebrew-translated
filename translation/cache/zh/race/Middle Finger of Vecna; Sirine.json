	"Sirines have the following racial traits:": "西林人有以下种族特征。",

	"Sirines are generally fickle and impulsive, and favor chaotic alignments.": "天狼星人一般是善变和冲动的，喜欢混乱的排列组合。",
	"Sirines are slightly taller than humans. Your size is Medium.": "西林人比人类略高。你的体型是中等。",
	"You can breathe normally in either air or water.": "你可以在空气或水中正常呼吸。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. You are, however, affected by any ability that would normally affect fey creatures. Your plane of origin is the Material Plane.": "你对被魅惑的救赎有优势，而且魔法不能使你入睡。然而，你会受到任何通常会影响精灵生物的能力的影响。你的原生界是物质界。",
	"You have proficiency in the {@skill Performance} skill.": "你对{@skill Performance}的技能有熟练的掌握。",
	"You can cast the {@spell charm person} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells and you require no material components to cast them.": "你可以用这个特性施放一次（%0%）的法术，并在你完成长时间休息后重新获得施放的能力。一旦你达到5级，你可以用这个特质施放一次{@spell suggestion}的法术，并在你完成长时间休息后重新获得这个能力。魅力是你对这些法术的施法能力，你不需要任何物质成分来施展它们。",

	"To a sirine, nothing is more important than living in the moment. They act as they please, seeking joy and pleasure wherever it may be found - especially if that happens to be by the seaside! Sirines love the fresh breeze and the feel of warm sand between their toes as much as anyone else; staking out the best spots on beaches to make sure their frolics attract just the right amount of attention.": "对沙林人来说，没有什么比活在当下更重要。他们随心所欲，在任何可能的地方寻求快乐和愉悦--特别是如果那恰好是在海边！他们喜欢新鲜的微风和脚趾间温暖的沙子的感觉。西里安人和其他人一样喜欢清新的微风和脚趾间温暖的沙子的感觉；在海滩上盯着最好的位置，以确保他们的嬉戏能吸引足够的注意力。",
	"As with most fey folk, their emotions are strong and shift rapidly, such that they may want to kiss someone one minute, and kill them the next. And a sirine's commitment to spontaneity is deep: they do not hesitate to act on these impulses. This can make them seem wild, but to a sirine, it is the natural state of things.": "与大多数精灵族人一样，他们的情绪很强烈，而且变化很快，比如他们可能前一分钟还想亲吻某人，后一分钟就想杀死他们。塞林人对自发性的承诺很深：他们毫不犹豫地按照这些冲动行事。这可能使他们看起来很狂野，但对沙林人来说，这是事物的自然状态。",
	"Sirines may gather on the shore to dance and sing, but they always return to their sunken villages when night falls. There, they hunt pearls, catch fish and grow crops much like humanoids, if humanoids could breathe underwater. Some sirines even share their homes with other aquatic creatures such as undines and merfolk, leading to great confusion among humanoid sailors.": "西林人可能会聚集在岸边跳舞和唱歌，但他们总是在夜幕降临时回到他们的沉没的村庄。在那里，他们猎取珍珠，捕鱼，种植农作物，就像人类一样，如果人类能在水下呼吸的话。有些Sirines甚至与其他水生生物如undines和merfolk分享他们的家园，导致人形水手之间的巨大混乱。",
	"Any humanoid that sees a sirine is liable to be struck by their incredible beauty. With perfectly clear skin that ranges in tone from pinks through golds to greens and blues, delicate flowing hair (in equally vibrant color) and lithe, elegant bodies, there is no such thing as an ugly sirine. Furthermore, all are born with a fabulous singing voice, though some may be too shy to use it.": "任何看到赛琳的类人都会被她们惊人的美貌所震撼。他们拥有完美透明的皮肤，色调从粉色到金色，再到绿色和蓝色，精致飘逸的头发（同样鲜艳的颜色）和轻盈优雅的身体，没有丑陋的沙林。此外，所有的人都生来就有一个美妙的歌声，尽管有些人可能太害羞而不敢使用它。",
	"Sirines have short, beautiful names that flow off the tongue like water.": "西里安人的名字简短而优美，像水一样从舌头上流过。",
