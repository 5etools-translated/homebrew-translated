	"From distant lands to the untamed islands of the south, the connection of koalas to the bearkin lineage is often in dispute. They still carry the ferocity of the race however, despite their smaller size.

The rumors of their cannibalistic nature are unfounded (though not entirely dismissed).": "从遥远的国度到南方桀骜不驯的岛屿，考拉与bearkin血统的联系往往存在争议。然而，尽管它们的体型较小，但仍然带有该种族的凶猛特征。在它们臭名昭著的炎热和危险的家园，它们在树上形成了小型的游牧社区，从低垂的树枝上落下，惊吓和攻击它们的猎物，这些猎物往往是它们体型的数倍。关于它们食人的传言是没有根据的（尽管没有完全被否定）。",

Intelligent or scholarly bearkin often wish to discover this detail.": "其他关于bearkin起源的理论不太可信，比如他们在战争后作为Feywilds的本土守护者逃到了物质世界，或者他们的创造归功于一支伟大的战士军队的契约，他们被赋予熊的身体和力量来支配他们的敌人。聪明的或有学问的bearkin常常希望发现这个细节。",

	"Most often, a bearkin leaves as a result of disgracing their family in battle or breaking code, though many bearkin found in cities credit their abandonment to a family massacre, being lost, forest fires, or other causes that physically ejected them from their home.

They claim to have seen visions of their god in their sleep designating them a specific task, and it is not uncommon for a member of the tribe to leave in pursuit of this mission, which is a sign of honor.": "Bearkin相信Grizzus在游戏和战斗中观察和指导他们，他经常与部落内的长老或萨满以及特别正义或强大的战士联系。他们声称在睡梦中看到了他们的神指定给他们的特定任务的幻象，部落中的成员为了追求这个任务而离开是很常见的，这也是一种荣誉的象征。",
	"Bearkin, while wild, have a strict code of honor bestowed upon them by their god-protector, Grizzus, when dictating combat between tribes or individuals. The Code of Grizzus guarantees that a fair fight will be had between both parties, fighting unarmed and face-to-face. Bearkin who purposefully break this vow are often cast out from their clan to live in solitude.": "熊人，虽然是野生的，但他们有严格的荣誉准则，由他们的神的保护者Grizzus赋予他们，当支配部落或个人之间的战斗。格里祖斯法则保证双方会有一场公平的战斗，不携带武器，面对面地战斗。故意违背这一誓言的熊人通常会被赶出他们的部族，过着孤独的生活。",
	"Bearkin names are derived from their grizzly origin, and therefore have strong sounds and syllables.

Others who refer to them in this way are sure to raise a bearkin's ire.": "熊人的名字源于他们的灰熊血统，因此具有强烈的声音和音节。你的熊金通常也有一个宠物的名字，他们在整个部落中被称为宠物，甚至在他们成年后也经常被他们的长辈和配偶亲昵地称为宠物。其他以这种方式称呼他们的人肯定会引起bearkin的愤怒。",
