	"Sailors were running about, jumpin' overboard, and screamin' about folks underwater–not just folks: women.

But then I looked over the bow and saw them for a split second: a trio, a lad and two lasses.": "水手们跑来跑去，跳下船去，对水下的人大喊大叫--不仅仅是人：女人。我想这一定是坏血病，或者也许只是热；我们已经好几个星期没有靠岸了，这肯定会影响到男人。但后来我从船头看过去，一瞬间就看到了他们：三人组，一个小伙子和两个小姑娘。",

	"The sea is a dangerous place, filled with predators and hostile peoples such as merrow and sahuagin. Moreover, the technological developments that have helped humans to conquer the lands are not available underwater. All of this means that merfolk society has remained tribal and undeveloped, in small, scattered communities.": "海洋是一个危险的地方，充满了掠食者和敌对的民族，如梅罗和萨瓦金。此外，帮助人类征服陆地的技术发展在水下是不存在的。所有这些都意味着人鱼社会仍然是部落式的、不发达的、小而分散的社区。",
	"Although there are some merfolk cities, built into easily-defended mazes of rock and coral, there are relatively few locations in the world that are suitable for such development, and little incentive for merfolk to settle in one place.

	"Merfolk eat fish, both by hunting them in the wild and by herding domesticated ones.

Their bodies quickly change in response to changes in their environment, and isolated pockets of merfolk can end up looking completely different from others of their race after just a few generations.": "人鱼族最大的优势之一是他们的适应能力。他们的身体很快就会随着环境的变化而改变，孤立的小部分人鱼族在短短几代之后就会变得与其他种族完全不同。",
