	"Satyrs are fairly short, usually around five feet tall. Your size is medium.": "萨特人相当矮小，通常大约五英尺高。你的体型是中等。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. You are, however, affected by any ability that would normally affect fey creatures. Your plane of origin is the Material Plane, the Feywild or Ysgard.": "你对被魅惑的救赎有优势，而且魔法不能使你入睡。然而，你会受到任何通常会影响费伊生物的能力的影响。你的起源位面是物质位面、精灵世界或Ysgard。",
	"Any creature that has been drinking alcohol with you regards you as a trusted friend for as long as it remains drunk, unless you deliberately harm it. Additionally, you can never become sick or poisoned from drinking alcohol.": "任何与你一起饮酒的生物，只要它还醉着，就会把你视为可信赖的朋友，除非你故意伤害它。此外，你永远不会因为饮酒而生病或中毒。",

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell charm person} spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the {@spell suggestion} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "你知道（%0%）的咒语。当你达到3级时，你可以用此特质将（1%）法术作为2级法术施放一次，并在完成长时间休息后重新获得此能力。当你达到5级时，你可以用这个特质施放一次{@spell suggestion}的法术，并在你完成长时间休息后重新获得这个能力。魅力是你对这些法术的施法能力。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.": "你能说、读、写普通话和希尔文。",
	"When I awoke, a single beam of light shot past my eyelid and landed, screeching, into my brain. By degrees, I fought past the pain in my cranium to take in my surroundings: a grassy field, far from the tavern in which I last remembered myself. Every detail of the night blurred together in a collage of shapes and colors, devoid of meaning.": "当我醒来时，一束光射过我的眼皮，落在我的大脑里，发出刺耳的声音。渐渐地，我克服了颅内的疼痛，打量着周围的环境：一片草场，离我最后记得的那个酒馆很远。夜晚的每一个细节都在形状和颜色的拼贴中变得模糊不清，毫无意义。",
	"\"Rough night, huh?\" a voice behind me beckoned suddenly. A cheerful satyr lounged on a broad stone nearby, his fingers quietly drumming on an idle pan flute in his lap.": "\"今晚很辛苦吧？\"一个声音在我身后突然招手。一个欢快的萨提尔躺在附近的一块宽大的石头上，他的手指静静地敲打着膝上闲置的盘笛。",
	"As he began to raise the pipes to his lips, I sensed his intent far too late to intervene.": "当他开始把管子举到嘴边时，我察觉到他的意图，但已来不及干预。",

	"You happy people: don't forget my mistake. Don't try to out-drink a satyr.": "你们这些快乐的人：不要忘记我的错误。不要试图超越萨提尔的酒量。",
	"Squat, hairy, human-shaped fey with goat-like features and hoofed feet, satyrs love to dance, sing and frolic. They are wholly devoted to the pursuit of pleasure, and will celebrate any festival they hear of–the wilder the better! Satyrs will take any excuse to cut loose, often inventing flimsy pretexts to derail conversations and make themselves the center of attention.": "萨提尔喜欢跳舞、唱歌和嬉戏，他们是蹲着的、多毛的、人形的、有山羊般特征和蹄子的精灵。他们完全致力于追求快乐，并会庆祝他们听到的任何节日--越狂野越好！萨提尔会利用任何借口放纵自己。萨提尔会找任何借口放纵自己，经常编造一些站不住脚的借口来破坏谈话，使自己成为注意力的中心。",
	"Given their proclivity for living in the moment, it can be difficult to get satyrs to follow orders or even stay in one place for any length of time - though in an adventuring party they make up for such flakiness with the entertainment they provide, as well as their unsurpassed skill at gossip and rumor-mongering. Satyrs are very much at home in inns and taverns, sometimes venturing into humanoid settlements (usually in disguise) purely to sample the atmosphere of a particularly famous common room, gaze upon an extremely beautiful person, or taste an especially rich food.": "鉴于他们喜欢活在当下，很难让萨提尔听从命令，甚至很难在一个地方停留很长时间--不过在冒险队伍中，他们用自己提供的娱乐以及无与伦比的八卦和造谣技巧来弥补这种软弱。萨特在旅店和酒馆里非常自在，有时会冒险进入人形定居点（通常是伪装的），纯粹是为了品尝一个特别有名的公共房间的气氛，凝视一个极其美丽的人，或者品尝一种特别丰富的食物。",
	"Although they enjoy the pleasures of humanoid society, a satyr's true home is in the forest, and any visit to civilized lands will ultimately prove fleeting. Enchanted woodlands provide shelter and safety, as well as the companionship of other fey creatures, thus most satyrs make their homes in small, hidden villages. Others are more solitary, retreating to some secluded hermitage to perfect a piece of music or recover after a particularly intense festival.": "虽然他们享受人形社会的乐趣，但萨提尔真正的家是在森林里，任何对文明土地的访问最终都会被证明是短暂的。被施了魔法的林地提供了庇护所和安全，以及其他精灵生物的陪伴，因此大多数萨提尔把自己的家安在隐蔽的小村庄里。其他人则比较孤僻，退居到一些隐蔽的隐居地，以完善音乐作品或在特别紧张的节日后恢复。",
	"Satyrs have many goat-like aspects, including thick fur on their arms and legs, curling horns on their heads and hooves instead of feet. This makes them easy to identify, for they generally make no attempt to hide these features. A variety of different shades of fur are found among satyrs, with whites and browns being most common. The grooming habits of satyrs are unpredictable, as fey fashions can change rapidly, but the vast majority put at least some effort into looking good at all times.": "萨特人有许多类似山羊的地方，包括手臂和腿上的厚毛，头上的卷曲角和蹄子而不是脚。这使他们很容易被识别，因为他们一般不会试图隐藏这些特征。在萨提尔中发现了各种不同色调的毛皮，其中白色和棕色最为常见。萨提尔的修饰习惯是不可预测的，因为精灵的时尚可以迅速改变，但绝大多数人至少在任何时候都会努力使自己看起来不错。",
	"All Satyrs are male; female goat-legged fey are 'glaistigs', a completely different type of creature.": "所有萨提尔都是雄性；雌性山羊腿精灵是 \"glaistigs\"，是一种完全不同类型的生物。",
	"Though satyrs are given a name by their parents, they also take great pride on any nickname they can earn through their revelry and debauchery.": "虽然萨提尔的名字是由他们的父母给起的，但他们也对自己通过狂欢和放荡赢得的任何绰号感到非常自豪。",
	"Adronus, Avery, Barases, Canteon, Dantes, Gilderos, Grover, Jed, O'Connor, Pan, Phaegan, Puck, Romeus, Silenus, Tarteron, Tum-Tum, Willie": "Adronus, Avery, Barases, Canteon, Dantes, Gilderos, Grover, Jed, O'Connor, Pan, Phaegan, Puck, Romeus, Silenus, Tarteron, Tum-Tum, Willie",
	"Count Tipsy, Fairy-Dance, The Holy Drinker, Horny Devil, Mister Handsome, Ol' Three Sheets, The Roarin' Lord": "微醺伯爵、仙女之舞、神圣的饮者、好色的魔鬼、英俊的先生、老三张、咆哮的主人"
