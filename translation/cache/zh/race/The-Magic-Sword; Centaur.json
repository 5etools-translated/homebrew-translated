	"You may serve as a mount for a single creature your size or smaller, when you do so you always act independently of your rider. You also count as mounted at all times for the purposes of equipment, and any creature you carry in this way counts as half their normal weight for the purpose of determining whether or not you are encumbered.": "你可以作为一个与你体型相当或更小的生物的坐骑，当你这样做时，你总是独立于你的骑手行动。就装备而言，你在任何时候都算作骑乘，而且你以这种方式携带的任何生物在确定你是否有负担时都算作其正常重量的一半。",

	"As an equine centaur you are the strongest amongst the centaur and possess rippling muscles unmatched by any other type of centaur.

They tend to live in northern forests, where they pit their strength against the harsh conditions of the savage wilderness.": "作为一个马族半人马，你是半人马中最强壮的，拥有其他类型的半人马无法比拟的波纹状肌肉。马属半人马以其严厉而能干的战士而闻名，他们是完全有能力与最可怕的威胁作斗争的士兵，并以其惊人的力量压倒他们。他们倾向于生活在北方的森林里，在那里他们用自己的力量对抗野蛮荒野的恶劣条件。",
	"Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

	"— Mercedes Lackey, When Darkness Falls": "- 梅赛德斯-拉基，当黑暗降临时",
	"Centaur come in many different forms, and live in many different places- from secluded forests and great mountains, to the wide open grasslands, their connection with the natural world, and their bodies that so perfectly blend the mortal with the animal are probably their greatest single unifying traits. The centaur tribes hold respect for one's self, one's people, and for the natural world to be most the most important things in life.": "半人马有许多不同的形式，生活在许多不同的地方--从隐蔽的森林和大山，到宽阔的草原，他们与自然界的联系，以及他们完美地融合了凡人和动物的身体，可能是他们最大的一个统一的特征。半人马部落认为尊重自己、尊重人民、尊重自然是生活中最重要的事情。",
	"A centaur is physically defined by an almost perfect blend of beastly and humanoid traits. They have well-muscled bodies, and even the lithest among them having a certain supple strength. Mentally they are as intelligent as any other mortal race, with an intution and a sense for animals that far surpasses their more human counterparts.": "半人马在身体上的定义是野兽和人形特征的几乎完美结合。他们有健壮的身体，即使是最瘦小的人也有一定的柔韧力量。在智力方面，他们和其他凡人种族一样聪明，对动物的直觉和感觉远远超过了他们的人类同行。",
	"Regardless of type, centaur communities take two forms-- the first is traditionally known as the herd: roving tribes of centaur following their food sources and staying ahead of their enemies. The other is distinctly modern: mixed rural communities of centaur and others whom work hand in hand to protect and sustain their existences. In either case, centaur hold loyalty to the community as high in their esteem and will certainly fight to preserve the safety of their herd, whether that herd is the tribe, the village, or a company of adventurers.": "无论哪种类型，半人马社区都有两种形式--第一种是传统意义上的兽群：半人马的游牧部落跟随他们的食物来源，走在敌人的前面。另一种是明显的现代形式：半人马和其他人组成的混合农村社区，他们携手合作，保护和维持他们的生存。无论是哪种情况，半人马都把对社区的忠诚度看得很高，并且一定会为了保护他们族群的安全而战斗，无论这个族群是部落、村庄还是冒险家的公司。",
	"Centaur are usually serious and hardworking with a typically stern disposition, but that isn't to suggest that they are always morose, the typical centaur loves to celebrate the culmination of their labors with good food and drink, laughter amongst friends, and dancing. Festivals punctuating the Autumn and Spring are the typical causes for such celebration.": "半人马通常严肃勤奋，具有典型的严厉性格，但这并不意味着他们总是情绪低落，典型的半人马喜欢用美食和饮料、朋友间的欢笑和舞蹈来庆祝他们劳动的成果。秋季和春季的节日是这种庆祝活动的典型原因。",
	"Centaur respond to danger with courage and boldness, putting the safety of the herd before their own. Amidst the weapons used by centaur warriors, hafted weapons like spears and axes are particularly beloved. Other centaur choose to protect their communities with powerful druidic magicks and most centaur communities are led or advised by some variety of druidic shaman.": "半人马以勇气和胆量应对危险，将畜群的安全置于自己的安全之上。在半人马战士使用的武器中，长矛和斧头等有柄武器尤其受到喜爱。其他半人马选择用强大的德鲁伊魔法来保护他们的社区，大多数半人马社区由某种德鲁伊萨满领导或建议。",
	"Centaur communities, whether they be mixed race or purely centaur, are typically deeply suspicious of outsiders. Those from outside the herd are seen as potential dangers, and are unlikely to be trusted. For this reason, most such communities will be loath to ask for outside help, even as problems present themselves as being too large to handle on their own-- adventurers may have to prove themselves many times over before they are given the trust of the herd.": "半人马社区，无论是混血儿还是纯粹的半人马，通常都对外来者深表怀疑。那些来自兽群之外的人被视为潜在的危险，不太可能被信任。出于这个原因，大多数这样的社区都不愿意向外界寻求帮助，即使问题太大，自己无法处理--冒险者可能需要多次证明自己，才能得到族群的信任。",
	"Once the trust of the herd has been achieved however, there are few more loyal allies. centaur make loyal companions, and tend to make friends for life- viewing life as a series of hardships to be overcome by strong bonds of family and friendship.": "半人马是忠诚的伙伴，并倾向于结交终身的朋友--将生活视为一连串的艰难困苦，并通过强大的家庭和友谊纽带来克服。",
	"Centaur favor names that favor a hard consonant in every syllable. For surnames they tend to identify themselves as a member of a regional herd, more than individual families- as a result such a name can change over the course of their life as their herd itself might change.": "半人马喜欢每个音节都有一个硬辅音的名字。对于姓氏，他们倾向于将自己视为一个地区的畜群成员，而不是个别的家庭--因此，这样的名字可以在他们的生活过程中改变，因为他们的畜群本身可能会改变。",
	"Kardus, Tinskell, Sarm, Seltari, Burdock": "卡杜斯、丁斯凯尔、萨姆、塞尔塔里、牛蒡",
