	"Your skeleton is receptive to further grafting. You can spend 10 minutes to permanently graft purely decorative bones anywhere on your body. Additionally, if it has bones, you can graft the arm of a creature up to one size larger than you, and it becomes functional and can be removed at will. When you have three or more arms: ": "你的骨架是可以接受进一步嫁接的。你可以花10分钟在你身体的任何地方永久地嫁接纯装饰性的骨头。此外，如果它有骨头，你可以嫁接一个比你大一号的生物的手臂，而且它变得有功能，可以随意移除。当你有三只或更多的手臂时。",

	"A miserable pile of assorted bones. Graftlings are corpses who have had their skeletons transformed, grafted with those of other creatures, and infused with negative energy. They are given teeth with which to extract and pulverize bone, corrosive digestive fluids to break down and assimilate it, and the hunger to consume it. How closely a graftling resembles its original race is up to the whim of its creator, but because graftlings are the product of transplantation rather than total reconstruction, there is generally some resemblance. All graftlings end up a perversion of the skeleton.": "一堆悲惨的各种骨头。嫁接者是那些被改造过的尸体，他们的骨架与其他生物的骨架嫁接在一起，并被注入负能量。他们被赋予了提取和粉碎骨头的牙齿，分解和同化骨头的腐蚀性消化液，以及吞噬骨头的饥饿感。嫁接体与原始种族的相似程度取决于其创造者的意愿，但由于嫁接体是移植的产物，而不是完全重建，所以通常有一些相似性。所有的嫁接者最终都是骨架的变态。",
	"While a graftling's silhouette can oftentimes pass as humanoid, its anatomy errs. Beneath its bundle lies a twisted skeletal system, grafted in ways nature never intended. Here and there, bones are creased or gnarled from the strain of being shaped, like the roots of an ancient tree. An arm may contain the nose of a sawfish, the talons of a wyvern, and the ribs of howler—all of it mingled with the graftling's original skeleton. A typical graftling arrangement also includes portions that appear to be stock. Most commonly, the head and torso. However, this resemblance is only skin-deep. Blood is drained, organs become bone, cartilage masquerades as muscle and scar tissue. Within a suitable cavity, graftlings are then equipped with the system responsible for dissolving bone (a graftling is immune to its own acid). Because this remains active, it's common for graftlings to drool, especially in sight of a meal. A necromancer must provide either teeth and jaws capable of crushing bone, or a means to insert it directly into the cavity.": "虽然嫁接苗的轮廓往往可以作为人形，但它的解剖结构却有问题。在它的包袱下面是一个扭曲的骨骼系统，以自然界从未想过的方式嫁接。在这里和那里，骨骼因被塑造的压力而产生褶皱或虬结，就像古树的根部。一只手臂可能包含锯鱼的鼻子、狼牙棒的爪子和嚎叫的肋骨--所有这些都与嫁接动物的原始骨架混合在一起。一个典型的嫁接苗安排还包括看起来是股票的部分。最常见的是头部和躯干。然而，这种相似性只是皮毛而已。血液被抽干，器官变成骨头，软骨伪装成肌肉和疤痕组织。在一个合适的腔体中，移植物配备了负责溶解骨骼的系统（移植物对自身的酸有免疫力）。由于这个系统一直处于活跃状态，移植者流口水是很常见的，尤其是在看到食物的时候。死灵法师必须提供能够粉碎骨头的牙齿和下颚，或者提供直接插入腔内的方法。",
	"The magic by which a graftling's skeleton was manipulated becomes a permanent feature. This enables them to evolve beyond their creator's vision, attaching more bones as they see fit. Some add ribs sparingly; others favor  embellishment. More than mere form over function, graftlings can assimilate limbs in this manner, which allows them to act with greater efficiency.": "移植者的骨架被操纵的魔法成为一个永久的特征。这使他们能够超越创造者的设想，在他们认为合适的时候附加更多的骨头。有些人很少添加肋骨；有些人则喜欢装饰。不仅仅是形式大于功能，嫁接者可以通过这种方式同化四肢，这使他们能够以更高的效率行动。",
	"There are reasons beyond simple experimentation that might inspire a necromancer to create a graftling. Due to their intelligence and reserved disposition, graftlings make practical, less ambitious apprentices. What's more, what was once a miserable pile of assorted bones can now dispose of any unwanted miserable piles of assorted bones. While graftlings often emerge with their intelligence intact, the same cannot always be said for their identity. All find that some part of their past self is invariably corrupted in the process.": "除了简单的实验之外，还有一些原因可能会激发一个死灵法师创造一个嫁接者。由于他们的智慧和矜持的性格，嫁接者可以成为实用的、不那么有野心的学徒。更重要的是，曾经是一堆悲惨的杂碎骨头，现在可以处理任何不需要的悲惨的杂碎骨头堆了。虽然嫁接者往往在出现时智力完好，但他们的身份并不总是如此。所有的人都发现，在这个过程中，他们过去自我的某些部分无一例外地被腐蚀了。",
	"Not all bones are created equal. The bones of a kobold might be greasy; those of a cambion might be spicy. A graftling may prefer a certain type of bone, or outright ignore others.": "不是所有的骨头都是一样的。哥布林的骨头可能是油腻的；坎比恩的骨头可能是辛辣的。嫁接者可能更喜欢某种类型的骨头，或者直接忽略其他骨头。",
	"Unlike many undead, graftlings aren't made to be predators. They don't hunt the living. They are vultures of the battlefield; they haunt pillaged hamlets; they feast upon ossuaries. They scavenge. If a person needs to worry about a graftling, that person is already dead. Graftlings will avoid fighting for corpses, preferring caution to a meal for which they hunger but do not need.": "与许多亡灵不同，嫁衣女并不是为了成为掠食者。他们不猎杀活人。它们是战场上的秃鹰；它们出没于被掠夺的小村庄；它们在骨灰盒上大吃特吃。他们搜刮东西。如果一个人需要担心嫁接者，那么这个人已经死了。嫁衣匠会避免为尸体而战，宁可小心翼翼，也不愿意吃他们饥饿但不需要的食物。",
	"Graftlings who find themselves in the wild take refuge in the corners of the world dark enough to avoid others, but close enough to life to smell a corpse on the wind. They prefer to lead solitary lives. However, this predilection doesn't erase the personality they had in life—provided reanimation didn't do that much. Consider graftling character an issue of nature vs. nurture vs. nature.": "在野外发现自己的嫁衣人在世界的角落里避难，这些角落足够黑暗以避免他人，但又足够接近生命，可以闻到风中的尸体。他们喜欢过孤独的生活。然而，这种偏爱并不能抹去他们生前的个性--前提是复活术没有做那么多。考虑嫁接性格是一个自然与养育的问题。",
	"A graftling's disposition does not make them immune to wanderlust; it only dampens the desire. The call to travel might come from the memories of a life lost. Maybe they seek to exact revenge on their murderer. Maybe they want to confront their creator. Maybe they wish for more than mere survival. The reasons a graftling would set out are as numerous and varied as any character.": "嫁接者的性格并不使他们对流浪的欲望有免疫力；它只是抑制了这种欲望。旅行的呼唤可能来自对失去的生活的回忆。也许他们寻求对谋杀者进行报复。也许他们想面对他们的创造者。也许他们希望的不仅仅是生存。一个嫁衣人出发的原因就像任何角色一样多而杂。",
	"Those who grow restless enough to venture into civilization must tread lightly, and dress heavily. Undead are feared if not hated, so discovery could very well mean death. How well a graftling adjusts to civilization depends in part on the personality they had in life, in part on their willpower and discretion.": "那些不安分到要冒险进入文明的人必须轻装上阵，穿戴整齐。亡灵即使不被人憎恨，也会被人畏惧，所以发现亡灵很可能意味着死亡。嫁接者对文明的适应程度部分取决于他们在生活中的个性，部分取决于他们的意志力和谨慎。",
	"Graftlings would do well to keep their figure in mind when outfitting. Heavy, loose-fitting clothing goes a long way in concealing their odd bone structure. Illusions, masks, and disguise kits are tools with a place in any graftling's repertoire.": "嫁衣人在穿衣时最好记住他们的身材。厚重、宽松的衣服可以很好地掩盖他们奇怪的骨骼结构。幻觉、面具和伪装工具在任何嫁接者的剧目中都有一席之地。",
	"Graftlings will use the name they had in life, unless they've forgotten it or chosen to forsake a past to which they no longer belong. In either case, they'll assume the name given to them by their creator, if given one, or choose a name that appeals to them.": "嫁接者会使用他们生前的名字，除非他们已经忘记了，或者选择放弃他们不再属于的过去。在这两种情况下，他们会使用他们的创造者给他们的名字，如果有的话，或者选择一个吸引他们的名字。",
	"Graftling Names: Ahki, Callus, Caret, Chirr, Clak, Fyerk, Huam, Kashl, Kvetch, Mort, Nyargh, Odokuro, Pelops, Rote, Scroop, Sistrum, Skel, Skrim, Slummock, Smelch, Urk, Zailofon": "嫁接的名字。Ahki, Callus, Caret, Chirr, Clak, Fyerk, Huam, Kashl, Kvetch, Mort, Nyargh, Odokuro, Pelops, Rote, Scroop, Sistrum, Skel, Skrim, Slummock, Smelch, Urk, Zailofon",
	"If your DM allows the use of feats from chapter 6 of the {@italic Player's Handbook}, your graftling character has access to the following special feats.": "如果你的管理员允许使用{@italic Player's Handbook}第六章中的功法，你的嫁接角色可以使用下列特殊功法。",

	"You can use your action to expel a spray of acid in a 5 by 30 ft. line. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. Once you use your discharge, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "你可以用你的行动在5×30英尺的范围内喷出酸液。每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作（DC8+你的熟练度加成+你的体质修改器）。拯救失败时，生物会受到2D6的酸液伤害，拯救成功时，会受到一半的伤害。伤害在6级时增加到3d6，11级时增加到4d6，16级时增加到5d6。一旦你使用了你的放电，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
