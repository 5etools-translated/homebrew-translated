The derro hide within their insanity in the hope that the dark gods they fear will turn their attention to other, saner races first.": "在地底深处，德鲁人在他们疯狂的建筑师建造的扭曲的城市中等待。这些疯狂的人形生物在无光的深处生活、工作，并以某种方式茁壮成长。他们了解居住在星星之间的无情之神的真相，他们很久以前就放弃了理智来拯救自己。德罗人隐藏在他们的疯狂之中，希望他们所恐惧的黑暗之神会首先将注意力转向其他更理智的种族。",

	"The true history of the derro is an incomprehensible tangle. The entire race is insane, so even when derro keep records, their accounts conflict with each other and with observable reality. The various cults and clans of the derro embrace a wide variety of myths, mostly passed along by oral tradition and mind-bending artwork. Every new teller of a given tale twists or rewrites portions of the story to fit their own warped view of the world.": "德罗人的真实历史是一个难以理解的纠结。整个种族都是疯狂的，所以即使德鲁人有记录，他们的叙述也是相互冲突的，而且与可观察到的现实相冲突。德鲁人的各种邪教和部族拥护各种各样的神话，大部分是通过口述传统和令人费解的艺术作品流传下来。每个新的故事讲述者都会扭曲或改写故事的部分内容，以适应他们自己扭曲的世界观。",
	"The derro have existed for ages, perhaps thriving even before the spread of humans across the surface. The more reliable histories of other races agree that the derro have always served the drow as enforcers and slave masters. The drow regard them with a strange type of favor, almost like dim-witted children. The aboleths and duergar have likewise historically used and abused the derro. The derro know no actual friends, but they are overawed by power and dominance. They serve beings whose assumed superiority impresses them.": "德罗人已经存在了很久，也许在人类传播到地表之前就已经繁荣起来了。其他种族比较可靠的历史都认为，德鲁人总是作为执行者和奴隶主为乌鸦服务。德罗人对他们有一种奇怪的好感，几乎就像愚笨的孩子。Aboleths和duergar也同样在历史上利用和虐待过德鲁人。德罗人不认识真正的朋友，但他们被权力和统治力吓倒了。他们服务于那些假想的优越感让他们印象深刻的生物。",
	"Love as other races know it is unheard of in the bizarre core family unit of the derro. Derro children are born sane, but they are deliberately driven mad by their relatives, usually by age four. Parents feed, clothe, and protect their children not out of a sense of love or tenderness, but because they know that every derro awakened to the mind-bending truth of their race brings them glory. The horrific rituals that break a young derro's sanity vary by tribe and even year to year. Details are sparse, but known ritual names include Staring into the Void, Enduring the Heartless Fire, and the First Drink of True Knowledge.": "其他种族所知道的爱情在德鲁人怪异的核心家庭单元中是闻所未闻的。德罗人的孩子出生时是正常的，但他们被他们的亲属故意逼疯，通常在四岁时。父母给他们的孩子提供食物、衣服和保护，并不是出于爱或温柔，而是因为他们知道，每一个被唤醒的德鲁人都会为他们的种族带来荣耀。打破年轻德鲁人理智的可怕仪式因部落而异，甚至每年都不同。详情不详，但已知的仪式名称包括凝视虚空、忍受无情之火和第一杯真正的知识。",
	"Derro are paranoid, unstable, and jittery, and many suffer powerful delusions of grandeur as well. Madness compels them to commit acts of cruelty against their companions or pets, and these acts ignite constant infighting among them. A few, however, muster enough restraint and control to keep the entirety of derro society from crumbling. Savants are powerful sorcerers who hold their madness at bay long enough to cobble together coherent plans, though even they are dangerously unpredictable. The most powerful leaders are the derro antipaladins. These terrifying engines of crazed destruction have looked deep into the void between stars and survived, and even the savants respect them for that.": "德罗人偏执、不稳定、易激动，许多人还患有强烈的妄想症。疯狂迫使他们对自己的同伴或宠物实施残忍的行为，这些行为在他们之间引发了持续的内讧。然而，只有少数人能够保持足够的克制和控制，使整个德鲁社会不致崩溃。救世主是强大的巫师，他们将自己的疯狂控制在足够长的时间内，拼凑出连贯的计划，尽管即使他们也是危险的不可预测的。最强大的领导者是德鲁的反帕拉丁（antipaladins）。这些可怕的疯狂破坏的引擎已经深入到星星之间的虚空并存活了下来，甚至救世主也因此尊重他们。",
	"The derro worship a horde of bizarre and terrible beings. Derro ancestral gods such as Addrikah, the Mother of Madness, are common figures of veneration, as are demon lords. Perhaps the most disturbing of their deities are the Great Old Ones whose mere symbolic presence melts minds and corrupts the world. Derro worshipers venerate Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath the Black Goat of the Woods in particular. There is no pattern or reason that governs which dark being will catch a given derro's fancy, and devotees are violently hostile to worshipers of other entities.": "德罗人崇拜一大群怪异而可怕的生物。德罗人的祖先之神，如疯狂之母艾德里卡（Addrikah），是常见的崇拜对象，恶魔领主也是如此。也许他们最令人不安的神灵是伟大的老者，他们仅仅是象征性的存在就能融化人们的思想，腐蚀世界。德罗的崇拜者特别崇敬尼亚拉托特普（Nyarlathotep）和森林黑羊舒布-尼古拉斯（Shub-Niggurath）。没有任何模式或理由可以约束哪个黑暗生物会引起某个德鲁人的兴趣，而且信徒们对其他实体的崇拜者有强烈的敌意。",
	"Derro consider themselves the most exalted servants of the blasphemous figures they venerate, the only beings in the entire multiverse who can truly understand their glory. Specific rituals vary from cult to cult, but the unifying thread of derro faith asserts that their racial madness is a gift that makes communion with these deities possible. Further, the derro believe they are the harbingers of the end of time, and that they alone will inherit the shattered husk of creation.": "德罗人认为自己是他们所崇敬的亵渎神灵的最崇高的仆人，是整个多元宇宙中唯一能够真正理解他们的荣耀的存在。具体的仪式因教派而异，但德鲁人信仰的统一主线是，他们的种族疯狂是一种天赋，使得与这些神灵的交流成为可能。此外，德鲁人相信他们是时间终结的预言家，只有他们才能继承创世的破碎外壳。",
	"Names are thrust upon derro children haphazardly and with no clear general customs. Derro who worship an ancestor god might give their children a variation on the exalted figure's name or title, or a child might grow almost to maturity before any adult bothers to call them by the same jumble of sounds twice. Clan, tribe, and family names also lack any discernable pattern, though occasionally they form a coherent description.": "名字被胡乱地强加给德鲁人的孩子，没有明确的一般习俗。崇拜祖先之神的德鲁人可能会给他们的孩子起一个高高在上的名字或头衔的变体，或者一个孩子在长大成人之前，可能会被任何成年人打扰，用同样的杂音叫他们两次。氏族、部落和家族的名字也缺乏任何可识别的模式，尽管它们偶尔会形成一个连贯的描述。",

	"In truth, the derro are less violent and more peculiar in a quieter way than their common portrayal as rabid maniacs. Among themselves, they are as likely to be brooding, depressed, or sullen as crazed and violent. A derro PC could have a tendency to talk to himself, or might address an invisible friend before undertaking any major step, or might simply consider all the other members of the party as \"imaginary friends,\" and thus not subject to harassment.": "事实上，德鲁人没有那么暴力，比起他们通常被描绘成狂热的疯子，他们的方式更奇特。在他们中间，他们很可能是忧郁的、沮丧的或闷闷不乐的，而不是疯狂的和暴力的。一个德鲁人可能有自言自语的倾向，或者在采取任何重大措施之前，可能会向一个看不见的朋友讲话，或者干脆把党的所有其他成员视为 \"想象中的朋友\"，因此不会受到骚扰。",
	"Treat the derro's madness as an occasional bit of flavor for the character, rather than an excuse to cripple the party with chaotic and self-defeating actions. A derro PC won't be as predictable as a dwarf paladin or a half-elf bard, but if the other players can cope with a bonestupid half-orc barbarian picking bar fights and that elf rogue picking the ogre's pockets, they might accept the derro occasionally talking to rocks and interrogating mushrooms. Review the Minor Madnesses section for examples of playable and flavorful maladies.": "把德鲁的疯狂当作角色的一种偶然的风味，而不是用混乱和自毁的行动来削弱队伍的借口。一个德鲁人不会像矮人圣骑士或半精灵吟游诗人那样可以预测，但如果其他玩家可以应付一个愚蠢的半兽人野蛮人在酒吧打架和精灵流氓扒食人魔的口袋，他们可能会接受德鲁人偶尔与岩石交谈和审问蘑菇。回顾一下 \"次要的疯狂 \"部分，以了解可玩的、有风味的疾病的例子。",
	"To avoid derailing the party constantly, the character can have long lucid periods, and might even regret actions taken when \"turned to the dark void\" or \"ridden by the bat spirits\" or a similar in-game explanation. The derro in this lucid state could be a tragic character, always wondering when something will set off another bout of irrational raving.": "为了避免党派不断出轨，这个角色可以有很长的清醒期，甚至可能在 \"转向黑暗的虚空 \"或 \"被蝙蝠的灵魂骑着 \"或类似的游戏解释时对所采取的行动感到后悔。处于这种清醒状态的疯子可能是一个悲剧性的人物，总是想知道什么时候会引发另一场非理性的狂欢。",
	"Playing a derro PC involves making a fantasy form of otherworldly madness both playable and plausible. Find a way to make your character memorable without spoiling everyone else's game.": "扮演德鲁的人需要使一种幻想中的异世界的疯狂既可玩又合理。找到一种方法，使你的角色令人难忘，同时又不破坏其他人的游戏。",
	"Dhampirs reach maturity at the same age as humans, but their lifespans are much longer. They can live up to 750 years before death finally claims them.": "拜尔族人在与人类相同的年龄达到成熟期，但他们的寿命要长得多。在死亡最终到来之前，他们可以活到750岁。",
	"Most dhampirs are neutral, but some are driven toward evil by the bitterness and suspicion their parentage thrusts upon them. A few turn toward good in defiance of their nature.": "大多数丹皮尔人是中立的，但有些人被他们的父母所推崇的苦难和猜疑所驱使，走向了邪恶。少数人不顾自己的本性而向善。",

	"Your base walking speed is 30 feet.": "你的基本行走速度是30英尺。",
	"Thanks to your undead ancestry, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "由于你的亡灵血统，你在黑暗和昏暗的条件下有卓越的视力。你可以在60英尺范围内看到昏暗的光线，就像亮光一样，而在黑暗中就像昏暗的光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"You can bite as an unarmed strike against an incapacitated creature or one you have grappled. Your bite deals 1 point of piercing damage, and if the creature has blood and isn't a construct or undead, you can feed from it as part of the attack. Your feeding deals necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and if your target takes damage you regain one spent hit die. You can regain a number of spent hit dice with this trait equal to your Constitution modifier per long rest (minimum of 1).": "你可以将咬人作为对无能力的生物或被你抓住的生物的非武装攻击。你的撕咬造成1点穿刺伤害，如果该生物有血并且不是构筑物或不死生物，你可以在攻击中以它为食。你的进食造成的坏死伤害等于你的魅力修改器（最小值为1），如果你的目标受到伤害，你会恢复一个已用的命中模。你可以通过这个特性恢复相当于你的宪法修改器的已用命中数，每一个长期休息时间（最小为1）。",
	"As an action, you can magically beguile the mind of a creature that you can see within 30 feet. For 1 hour, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against the target. If you or any of your allies attack or damage the target, this effect ends. When the effect ends, the target feels repulsed by you and becomes hostile toward you until the next dawn, during which time it becomes immune to this effect. A hostile creature won't necessarily attack outright, but it won't deal with you in any way and might actively try to hinder you. You can use this trait once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.": "作为一个行动，你可以用魔法诱导30英尺内你能看到的生物的思想。在1小时内，你对目标的魅力检查有优势。如果你或你的任何盟友攻击或伤害目标，这个效果就会结束。当效果结束时，目标会对你感到厌恶，并对你产生敌意，直到下一个黎明，在此期间，它将对这个效果免疫。有敌意的生物不一定会直接攻击你，但它不会以任何方式对付你，而且可能会主动试图阻碍你。你可以使用这个特质一次，当你完成短期或长期的休息时，可以重新获得这样的能力。",

	"You can speak, read, and write Common.": "你能说、读、写普通话。",
	"The half-living children of vampires and human mothers, dhampirs are born into a world that rejects them. Stigma and suspicion follow them regardless of whether the truth of a dhampir child's nature is known. This mistrust either forces a dhampir to develop a disarming wit and charm, or to embrace bitterness and keep others at arm's length through guile or outright intimidation.": "吸血鬼和人类母亲的半生不熟的孩子，出生在一个拒绝他们的世界。无论吸血族孩子的本性是否为人所知，污名和猜疑都会跟随他们。这种不信任迫使吸血鬼发展出一种迷人的机智和魅力，或者拥抱苦涩，并通过欺骗或直接恐吓与他人保持距离。",
	"Few dhampirs find solace with their undead forebears. As living creatures, even tainted ones, the reality of living with an evil, blood-sucking monster seldom appeals even as they struggle with their own urges or hungers. Dhampirs struggle to find acceptance both within society and within themselves.": "很少有丹皮尔人从他们的亡灵祖先那里找到慰藉。作为生物，即使是被污染的生物，与邪恶的、吸血的怪物一起生活的现实很少有吸引力，即使他们在与自己的冲动或饥饿作斗争。拜尔族人努力寻找社会和自身的认同。",
	"Dhampirs appear much like humans at first glance. Adults stand between 5 and 6 feet tall but are more slender on average than humans; males weigh around 160 pounds. Female dhampirs are only slightly shorter but are a fair bit leaner, weighing around 120 pounds. Their skin and hair color runs the vast spectrum of tones available to humans, though they tend to be slightly pale.": "达姆比尔人第一眼看上去很像人类。成年人身高在5至6英尺之间，但平均比人类更苗条；男性体重约160磅。雌性丹皮尔人只是稍微矮一点，但更瘦一些，体重约为120磅。他们的皮肤和头发的颜色与人类可用的色调相差无几，但他们往往略显苍白。",
	"Their flawless features are tinged with some unnamable exotic quality. Despite the fear and uncertainty that follow them, the half-dead possess a seductive appearance. Listeners find themselves unconsciously giving weight to a dhampir's words and are drawn to his or her presence. Dhampirs glide through life with a seemingly effortless grace that belies their struggle.": "他们无暇的五官染上了一些难以名状的异国情调。尽管跟随他们的是恐惧和不确定性，但半死人拥有诱人的外表。听众会发现自己不自觉地重视拜尔人的话语，并被他或她的存在所吸引。吸血鬼以一种似乎毫不费力的优雅在生活中滑行，掩盖了他们的挣扎。",
	"For most dhampirs, family is all they have. Immediate kin might be the only source of solace for a dhampir raised by a mortal family. Driven away by the unconscious or superstitious derision of their peers, families containing a dhampir can easily become clannish and reclusive. They learn to keep the world at a distance to protect themselves and their loved ones. Dhampirs who grow up in this situation commonly strike out on their own after reaching maturity, both out of a need to find connection to the greater world and to spare their family the burden of their presence.": "对于大多数吸血族来说，家庭是他们的全部。直系亲属可能是被凡人家庭抚养长大的吸血鬼的唯一慰藉来源。由于被同龄人无意识的或迷信的嘲笑所驱赶，有吸血鬼的家庭很容易变得宗族化和隐居。他们学会与世界保持距离，以保护他们自己和他们所爱的人。在这种情况下长大的拜尔族人在成熟后通常会自立门户，这既是出于寻找与更大世界的联系的需要，也是为了让他们的家人免于承担他们的负担。",
	"Conversely, some dhampirs are born into bloodlines that deliberately cultivate their tainted nature. A true vampire patron, usually the one who originally began the line, oversees these bloodlines. Such a bloodline holds its lineage in the highest regard. There is no doubt among its members that theirs is a superior stock and upbringing, and that greatness is their due. The majority of outright evil dhampirs arise from cultivated bloodlines. They quickly become true monsters, seeing the fear of the living world as envy of their station.": "相反，有些丹皮尔人出生在故意培养其污点的血统中。一个真正的吸血鬼守护者，通常是最初开始这个血统的人，负责监督这些血统。这样的血统将其血统置于最高的地位。在其成员中，毫无疑问，他们的血统和教养都很优秀，而且伟大是他们应得的。大多数彻头彻尾的邪恶丹皮尔人来自于培养的血统。他们很快就成为真正的怪物，把对生命世界的恐惧看作是对他们地位的羡慕。",
	"Particularly close-knit or cosmopolitan communities can easily tolerate a dhampir in their midst, but that has more to do with adherence to tradition or relative anonymity than true acceptance. Larger cities include dhampirs sprinkled among the population as the half-dead blend in and find their niche, relying on their innate charm. Dhampir don't relate easily to humans but find a natural kinship with other half-breed races, particularly the fiendish tieflings. They, along with half-orcs and half-elves, know all too well what it's like to live between two worlds, never truly fitting in to either.": "特别是亲密的或世界性的社区可以很容易地在他们中间容忍一个吸血鬼，但这更多的是与坚持传统或相对的匿名性有关，而不是真正的接受。较大的城市包括散布在人口中的拜尔人，因为半死不活的拜尔人依靠其天生的魅力融入并找到自己的位置。拜尔人不容易与人类打交道，但却发现与其他混血种族有着天然的亲缘关系，特别是邪恶的铁弗林人。他们与半兽人和半精灵一样，非常了解生活在两个世界之间的感觉，永远无法真正融入其中。",
	"Some dhampirs choose to band together for safety, camaraderie, and understanding. These groups are nomadic, traveling from town to town and making their living off the land. Such a band adheres to a loose set of guidelines called the Walking Crow edicts. These rules dictate the dhampirs' responsibility to protect one another from outsiders, for each caravan group to self-govern and be self-sustaining, and for every Crow to work toward the prosperity of the caravan. These groups rarely find warm welcome with outsiders, but they are tolerated because the Crows develop diverse adventuring skills by necessity. Despite their trepidation, villagers can resolve threats to their homes by hiring a band of Crows to handle the problem for them.": "一些丹皮尔人为了安全、友情和理解而选择结伴而行。这些团体是游牧民族，从一个城镇到另一个城镇，靠土地谋生。这样的团体遵守一套松散的准则，称为 \"行走的乌鸦法令\"。这些规则规定，丹皮尔人有责任互相保护，不受外人影响，每个商队团体都要自我管理，自负盈亏，每个乌鸦都要为商队的繁荣而努力。这些团体很少受到外来者的热烈欢迎，但他们被容忍了，因为乌鸦们在必要时发展了多样化的冒险技能。尽管村民们战战兢兢，但他们可以通过雇佣乌鸦群来解决对他们家园的威胁，为他们处理问题。",

The truth of their heritage weighs on them. Many experience disturbing urges to consume blood or to control others. They shun the light and find safety and comfort in darkness. Enticed and repulsed by mortals at the same time, this constant struggle is at the core of a dhampir's existence.": "拜尔族人不断与他们的本性作斗争。他们遭受着麻烦的教养和内在的腐败，这种腐败啃噬着文明的思想和行为。他们遗产的真相让他们感到沉重。许多人经历了令人不安的冲动，想要吸食血液或控制他人。他们回避光明，在黑暗中寻找安全和舒适。同时被凡人所吸引和排斥，这种持续的斗争是吸血鬼存在的核心。",
	"Many dhampirs use this struggle as fuel to action. Good dhampirs are horrified by their own corrupted existence and dedicate themselves to living in opposition to it. They become priests who venerate gods of light, or they vow to destroy all undead who perpetuate their misery. Others are broken by their turmoil. They lash out at the world in a rage of bloodlust and hatred. Many evil dhampirs turn to worship of demons and other gods of darkness and pain, seeking to conquer and subjugate their mortal peers.": "许多丹皮尔人将这种斗争作为行动的动力。好的丹皮尔人对他们自己的堕落的存在感到恐惧，并献身于反对它的生活。他们成为敬仰光明之神的祭司，或者发誓要消灭所有使他们的苦难延续下去的亡灵。其他人则被他们的动荡所打破。他们在嗜血和仇恨的怒火中向世界发泄。许多邪恶的丹皮尔人转而崇拜恶魔和其他黑暗与痛苦之神，寻求征服和压服他们的凡人同胞。",

	"Tribes of dust goblins spread across the blasted badlands once the magical cataclysm passed. The vast majority of their kind congregates in the eastern reaches of the wastes, in such great numbers that the area is known as the Goblin Wastes. The various tribes are extremely insular and keep their secrets from outsiders—including the names of their tribes. Explorers from beyond the wastes label the tribes with various names for their convenience. Though the goblins find these pseudonyms insulting, they grudgingly use them with outsiders.

Outsiders are sometimes surprised to discover that dust goblins carry themselves with a proud, severe bearing, as opposed to their more common cousins.": "一旦魔法大灾变过去，尘土妖精部落就会在爆炸的坏境中蔓延。他们中的绝大多数聚集在荒原的东部，数量众多，以至于该地区被称为 \"妖精荒原\"。各个部落都非常封闭，对外人保守秘密，包括他们部落的名字。来自荒原之外的探险家们为了方便，给各部落贴上了各种名字。尽管地精们认为这些假名是一种侮辱，但他们还是勉强地对外人使用这些假名。他们认为，透露部落的真实名称会泄露其力量。外人有时会惊讶地发现，尘土妖精带着骄傲、严厉的态度，而不是他们更常见的表亲。",

Their survival skills are exceptional, as the most successful of the few sentient races that thrive in the wastelands.

	"The core philosophy that drives all jinnborn regardless of their station is siraati—a mystical path that jinnborn believe is their spiritual and cultural guide. Intrinsic to being sab siraat is the belief that the jinni who created the tribes set them on a path that would lead ultimately to the Hidden World, a place beyond the toil of normal existence. The Hidden World is a land of plenty and fulfilled desire, free of the harsh realities of the desert and unspoiled by the plots and greed of the pathless. Sab siraat are divided along elemental lines, like the jinn themselves, and tribes tend to adhere to a single elemental path.": "驱使所有金人的核心理念是Siraati--一条神秘的道路，金人相信这是他们的精神和文化指南。作为sab siraat的内在信念是，创造部落的精灵让他们走上了一条最终通往隐秘世界的道路，一个超越正常生存的劳累的地方。隐秘世界是一片富饶和满足欲望的土地，没有沙漠的严酷现实，没有被无路人的阴谋和贪婪所破坏。萨博-萨拉特沿着元素线划分，就像精灵本身一样，部落倾向于坚持一个单一的元素路径。",
	"Although every jinnborn tribe holds these paths sacred, no two agree on the specifics. Some common elements persist between siraati of different tribes, however, based on the elemental nature of the paths themselves. Air sab siraat are proud and aloof. Fire-based sab siraat are vicious and draconian. Water sab siraat are carefree but mercurial, and earth sab siraat are stoic and driven. Even with these tendencies, tribes exhibit great diversity in customs, laws, stories, and mannerisms. Some tribes boast multiple patron jinn and might therefore represent multiple forms of the siraati. Other tribes absorb members through conquest or marriage, and likewise have access to more than one elemental path. Once a jinnborn sets his or her mind upon a siraati, however, only the patron jinni's intervention can change it.": "尽管每个金人部落都认为这些道路是神圣的，但没有两个部落在具体细节上达成一致。然而，在不同部落的Siraati之间，基于这些道路本身的元素性质，一些共同的因素仍然存在。空气型的萨博-萨拉特是骄傲和冷漠的。以火为基础的sab siraat是恶毒的和苛刻的。水系沙巴人无忧无虑，但多变，而土系沙巴人坚毅而有魄力。即使有这些倾向，各部落在习俗、法律、故事和举止方面表现出极大的多样性。有些部落拥有多个守护神，因此可能代表了多种形式的saraati。其他部落通过征服或婚姻吸收成员，同样可以获得不止一个元素路径。然而，一旦一个新生的精灵将他或她的思想设定在一个saraati上，只有守护精灵的干预才能改变它。",
	"Tribes of jinnborn take the concept of mystical paths very seriously, and they follow a nomadic lifestyle in accordance with those paths. Whether a given tribe herds camels or other livestock and follows the supply of fresh water from oasis to river, or another tribe rides as a family caravan seeking wealth through trade, literal and philosophical paths govern all. The tribes follow the physical paths their elders set down, knowing that these safe routes will lead them around dangerous sands, past beguiling mirages, and to safety and sustenance. Other jinnborn tribes make their way as mercenaries, selling their spells and blades as guards, soldiers-for-hire, or even turning to banditry. This is their path to the Hidden World.": "金人部落非常重视神秘道路的概念，他们按照这些道路遵循游牧的生活方式。不管是某个部落放养骆驼或其他牲畜，并跟随淡水供应从绿洲到河流，还是另一个部落作为家庭商队通过贸易寻求财富，字面和哲学的道路支配着所有。部落遵循他们的长辈设定的物理路径，知道这些安全的路线将带领他们绕过危险的沙地，经过诱人的海市蜃楼，到达安全和生计。其他金生部族则以雇佣兵的身份闯荡江湖，出售他们的法术和兵刃，作为卫兵、雇佣兵，甚至转而从事强盗活动。这就是他们通往隐秘世界的道路。",
	"Few jinnborn turn their back on the paths that lead them through the desert, and with good reasons. Outsiders frequently misread the jinnborn, though that is not entirely their fault. The jinnborn keep their word meticulously between themselves, but when dealing with the pathless outsiders, the line between what is said and what is meant blurs like the desert horizon at noon. The jinnborn rarely lie outright, but they speak in terms that allow them to twist their meaning.": "很少有金生的人背对着引领他们穿越沙漠的道路，而且有充分的理由。外人经常误解金生，尽管这并不完全是他们的错。晋人在自己之间一丝不苟地守信，但在与无路可走的外人打交道时，所说的话和所要表达的意思之间的界限就像中午时分的沙漠地平线一样模糊不清。晋人很少直截了当地撒谎，但他们说话的方式允许他们扭曲自己的意思。",
	"Also, the jinnborn who leave the open sands of the desert lose part of themselves. The longer they dwell in cities, they more they take on strange quirks and mannerisms. Remain away from the desert long enough, and their oddities develop into full-blown madness.": "另外，离开沙漠的空旷沙地的金生者会失去一部分自己。他们在城市中居住的时间越长，就越会有奇怪的怪癖和举止。离开沙漠足够长的时间，他们的怪癖就会发展成全面的疯狂。",
	"Jinn share many traits with genies—the most well known of the powerful elementals—but they are vastly more powerful still. Immortal beings older than recorded history, the jinn could easily contend with the sultans and emirs of the genie courts. The patrons of the oldest jinnborn tribes even approach demigod status. Although the material plane tribes might worship the jinn, they are not gods or even godlings, and they grant no spells or true divine powers through belief alone. Jinnborn rarely worship any gods, for to do so marks a jinnborn as having strayed from the path.": "晋人与精灵有许多共同的特征--最知名的强大元素--但他们的力量还是大得多。不朽的生命比有记载的历史还要久远，精灵可以轻易地与苏丹和精灵法庭的埃米尔抗衡。最古老的晋人部落的赞助人甚至接近半神的地位。虽然物质世界的部落可能会崇拜精灵，但他们不是神，甚至不是神灵，而且他们不会仅仅通过信仰授予法术或真正的神力。晋人很少崇拜任何神，因为这样做标志着一个晋人已经偏离了道路。",
	"Jinn are tied to one of the four elements, and they dwell on the corresponding elemental plane. They eschew the material plane except in rare occasions, either to duel a rival on neutral ground or to visit their patron tribes. So ancient are the jinn that most no longer use their names. They do have formal names, and these names have been kept safe by the patron's tribes. Jinnborn keep the name of the patron a close secret, and it is a deadly insult for a jinnborn to speak the name of another tribe's patron.": "晋被捆绑到四个元素之一，他们居住在相应的元素平面。他们避开了物质层面，除了在罕见的情况下，无论是决斗的对手在中立地或访问他们的守护部落。如此古老的晋人，大多数人不再使用他们的名字。他们确实有正式的名字，而这些名字已经被守护者的部落保存起来了。晋国人对守护者的名字严守秘密，对于一个晋国人来说，说出另一个部落的守护者的名字是一种致命的羞辱。",

	"Outwardly serene, the kijani resemble slender humanoids with a great affinity for their jungle home. Despite their mostly humanoid appearance, the kijani are plant creatures. Much like their physical appearance, their air of calm contemplation is likewise a veneer that conceals the truth—the kijani harbor a deep furnace of fury. Nearly destroyed by a tragedy long ago, the entire race carries the embers of that brush with oblivion and must constantly struggle against letting that rage consume them.": "外表安详，基贾尼人类似于纤细的人形动物，对他们的丛林家园非常亲近。尽管他们大多是人形的外表，但基贾尼人是植物生物。就像他们的外表一样，他们的平静沉思的空气也同样是掩盖事实的表象--基贾尼人怀有深深的愤怒之火。很久以前，他们几乎被一场悲剧摧毁了，整个种族都带着那场与遗忘擦肩而过的余烬，必须不断挣扎，避免让愤怒吞噬他们。",

	"Kijani are slender creatures; males stand around 5 and a half feet tall and females just shy of 5 feet. In spite of their lithe build and thin, long limbs, kijani are solidly built. As plant creatures, their bodies are compact and heavier than their silhouette would suggest. Males easily weigh over 190 pounds and females around 160. Skin and hair immediately give away the truth of a kijani's nature, as both are rich green in color.": "Kijani是一种纤细的生物；雄性身高约为5.5英尺，雌性略低于5英尺。尽管他们身材轻盈，四肢细长，但Kijani的身体很结实。作为植物生物，它们的身体比它们的轮廓所显示的要紧凑和沉重。男性的体重很容易超过190磅，女性的体重约为160磅。皮肤和头发立即暴露了基贾尼人的本性，因为两者都是浓绿的颜色。",
	"They are beautiful creatures, with stunning features and smooth skin. Their eyes are large and dominated by solid green pupils. Kijani move with easy grace, like saplings swaying in a warm breeze. Though they are capable of great bursts of speed and agility when needed, the plantfolk normally move sinuously. Their motions are generally deliberate and seductive, as if slowly dancing their way through life.": "他们是美丽的生物，拥有迷人的特征和光滑的皮肤。他们的眼睛很大，以纯绿色瞳孔为主。基贾尼的行动轻松优雅，就像树苗在温暖的微风中摇曳。虽然他们在需要的时候能够爆发出巨大的速度和敏捷性，但植物人通常是蜿蜒地移动。他们的动作通常是深思熟虑的，具有诱惑力，就像在生活中慢慢跳舞一样。",
	"For eons the kijani plantfolk dwelled peacefully in the dense jungle, barely noted by the powerful beings whose empire covered the world in ancient times. Upheaval came with the arrival of a circle of human druids. The kijani embraced the newcomers and welcomed them, sharing their deep, intimate knowledge of the natural world and the magic that flows through nature's veins. Their kindness spelled disaster. Using kijani knowledge, the foolish druids summoned a mighty avatar of nature that ravaged and dominated the mighty jungles, using them like its personal playthings. The kijani fled the beast's mutating and controlling power, but fully half the race was lost. Those left behind or captured were twisted into the thing's mindless servants, and the rest sought sanctuary in jungles far to the south.": "长久以来，基贾尼植物人和平地居住在茂密的丛林中，几乎没有被强大的生命注意到，他们的帝国在古代覆盖了整个世界。随着一圈人类德鲁伊的到来，动荡不安。基贾尼人拥抱了新来的人，欢迎他们，分享他们对自然世界的深刻而亲密的知识，以及流淌在大自然血管中的魔法。他们的善意带来了灾难。愚蠢的德鲁伊们利用基贾尼人的知识，召唤出一个强大的自然化身，蹂躏和支配着强大的丛林，把它们当作个人玩物。基贾尼人逃离了野兽的变异和控制能力，但整整一半的种族都失去了。那些被留下或被俘的人被扭曲成那东西的无意识的仆人，剩下的人则在南方遥远的丛林中寻求庇护。",
	"This exodus left the kijani deeply scarred. They maintain their peaceful kinship with other living things to this day, but the breaking of their race ignited the cinders of the boiling fury that plagues them. Tormented by equal parts fear and rage toward the great beast, the kijani strive to mend themselves by changing their nature. They call this plan the Great Change: They intend to leave their plant nature behind completely and become mammals.": "这次出走给基贾尼人留下了深深的伤痕。他们至今保持着与其他生物的和平亲属关系，但他们种族的断裂点燃了困扰他们的沸腾的愤怒的焦炭。在对巨兽的恐惧和愤怒的双重折磨下，基贾尼人努力通过改变自己的本性来修补自己。他们把这个计划称为 \"大变革\"。他们打算完全抛弃自己的植物本性，成为哺乳动物。",
	"The kijani start life in a very different state from most humanoids. When the plantfolk create a child, a single parent produces a seedling—a vinelike plant that symbiotically bonds with a host. Traditionally the parent hosts the seedling, which draws nutrients and even a small amount of life force directly from its host. The process is essentially harmless, resulting in little more than occasional fatigue and increased appetite for the host. The seedling gestates in this way, growing slightly larger over the course of a decade or so, until one day it detaches and begins its transformation into the adult stage. This process is rapid, and a fully adult kijani emerges 24 hours later.": "kijani人在开始生活时的状态与大多数人类非常不同。当植物人创造一个孩子时，单亲产生一个幼苗--一种与宿主共生的葡萄状植物。传统上，亲本是幼苗的宿主，幼苗直接从宿主那里吸取营养，甚至少量的生命力。这个过程基本上是无害的，除了偶尔的疲劳和增加宿主的食欲外，没有什么其他的结果。幼苗以这种方式孕育，在十年左右的时间里略微长大，直到有一天它脱离并开始转变为成年阶段。这个过程很迅速，24小时后，一个完全成年的Kijani出现了。",
	"Now, the kijani seek out a new way to perpetuate their species. While many plantfolk parents still serve as hosts to their seedling children, some seek out willing mammalian humanoid surrogates to host their seedlings for them. This is a crucial part of their Great Change—drawing energy, nutrition, and life from humanoids to incorporate into their children. As a society the kijani never force or trick others to serve as seedling hosts, but they welcome any willing surrogates into their culture with open arms and boundless gratitude.": "现在，Kijani人寻求一种新的方式来延续他们的物种。虽然许多植物人的父母仍然充当他们孩子幼苗的宿主，但有些人则寻找愿意的哺乳动物人形代孕者，为他们提供幼苗。这是他们伟大变革的一个关键部分--从人形生物中汲取能量、营养和生命，以融入他们的孩子。作为一个社会，基贾尼人从不强迫或欺骗他人作为幼苗的宿主，但他们张开双臂，以无限的感激之情欢迎任何愿意的代孕者进入他们的文化。",
	"To keep their roiling base urges in check, the kijani strive to be as serene and controlled as possible. Kijani band together in organizations known as clusters—groups of individual plantfolk who work together for the common good. Each cluster is guided by a single kijani known as a speaker. Though individual kijani are warm, personable, welcoming, and even seductive, clusters project a different attitude. They can be close-minded and clannish, with a tendency to prioritize their collective interests above individual concerns.": "为了控制他们汹涌澎湃的基本冲动，基贾尼人努力做到尽可能的宁静和控制。基贾尼人在被称为 \"集群 \"的组织中聚集在一起--由个体植物人组成的团体，为共同利益而工作。每个集群由一个被称为演讲者的Kijani指导。尽管单个的基贾尼人是热情的、有个性的、受欢迎的，甚至是诱人的，但集群的态度却不同。他们可能是心胸狭窄和宗族主义的，倾向于将集体利益置于个人关切之上。",
	"Despite their generally amiable nature, all kijani have a breaking point. The contained fury within them will eventually have its due, and when pushed past endurance, the kijani lash out with terrible ferocity. Mammalian humanoids completely fascinate the plantfolk. They work hard to understand human and other races' customs when they make contact with outsiders, and they commonly adopt those customs into their culture. Despite their group tendency to band together, kijani have a great reverence for life and can always find a way to relate with other living beings. One universal exception exists—druids. Plantfolk have a difficult time trusting druids given their race's history and fear of repeating the past disaster. Given their respect for life, they also abhor the undead and stop at nothing to exterminate them.": "尽管他们通常是和蔼可亲的，但所有的基贾尼人都有一个突破点。他们体内蕴藏的怒火最终会得到应有的回报，当被逼到忍无可忍的地步时，基贾尼人就会爆发出可怕的凶猛。哺乳动物类人完全让植物人着迷。当他们与外来者接触时，他们努力理解人类和其他种族的习俗，并普遍将这些习俗纳入自己的文化。尽管他们有结伴而行的群体倾向，但基贾尼人对生命非常敬畏，总能找到与其他生物发生关系的方法。有一个普遍存在的例外--德鲁伊。鉴于他们种族的历史和对重复过去灾难的恐惧，植物人很难信任德鲁伊。鉴于他们对生命的尊重，他们也憎恨亡灵，并不惜一切代价来消灭它们。",
	"Kijani favor multisyllabic names with multiple vowels. Their names are very difficult for outsiders to pronounce correctly, so the plantfolk use a shortened version as a nickname when in non-kijani company.": "基贾尼人喜欢用多个元音的多音节名字。他们的名字对外人来说很难正确发音，所以植物人在与非基贾尼人在一起时，会使用一个简短的版本作为绰号。",

No matter what victories lamias achieve, they can't fill the gaping hole in their souls the curse left behind. This unquenchable longing drives lamias to embrace excess and overindulgence. They indulge in lust, luxury, gory feasts, and violent trysts in a vain attempt to salve their emptiness.": "蛇尾拉米亚人性感而诱人，他们出生在一个被苦难吞噬的生活中。该种族的起源是人类，但一个古老的诅咒将他们扭曲成半人半兽的形式。无论拉米亚人取得什么样的胜利，他们都无法填补诅咒在他们灵魂中留下的空洞。这种无法抑制的渴望驱使拉米亚人拥抱过度和放纵。他们沉溺于欲望、奢华、血腥的盛宴和暴力的试探，妄想以此来拯救他们的空虚。",

	"Skin and hair tones run the wide range seen among humans. Lamia eyes are large and liquid, presenting a full range of colors. Their snake tails are covered in glossy scales that whisper when they move. Beautiful hypnotic patterns of curves or diamond shapes are just as likely as tails of a uniform color. Common colors include bright green, dull red, glossy black, pale gold, and dusty tan. Tattoos are common, and many lamias ink mystic symbols into the flesh of their arms and chests.": "皮肤和毛发的色调与人类中看到的范围很广。拉米亚的眼睛大而有神，呈现出全方位的色彩。它们的蛇尾覆盖着光亮的鳞片，移动时发出低吟声。曲线或钻石形状的美丽催眠图案与统一颜色的尾巴一样可能。常见的颜色包括鲜绿色、暗红色、有光泽的黑色、淡金色和灰褐色。纹身是很常见的，许多拉米亚人在他们的手臂和胸部的肉上涂抹神秘的符号。",
	"The curse that brought the lamias into existence originated in the Abyss. The stain of that corrupt demonic power left its mark on the lamias, and they are prone to both evil and chaos. Even those who reject their nature and strive for the light struggle with their heritage, and all are prone to sudden mood shifts and outbursts. As a result of this otherworldly touch, their flesh remains unblighted by age. Once lamias reach maturity they show little physical sign of aging, even as they near the end of their lifespans. They aren't immortal, but lamias remain beautiful until the grave swallows them.": "导致拉米亚人存在的诅咒源于深渊。腐败的恶魔力量的污点在拉米亚人身上留下了印记，他们很容易出现邪恶和混乱。即使是那些拒绝他们的本性并努力追求光明的人，也会与他们的遗产作斗争，而且都容易出现突然的情绪变化和爆发。由于这种超凡脱俗的触觉，他们的肉体仍然不受年龄的影响。一旦拉米亚人达到成熟，他们的身体几乎没有衰老的迹象，即使他们接近寿命的终点。他们不是不死之身，但拉米亚人仍然美丽，直到坟墓吞噬他们。",
	"Reflecting this frozen beauty, the race suffers from a stunted capacity to create. True artists are almost unheard of, and those lamias who make the attempt often resort to stealing inspiration from others only to produce works that showcase the race's psychological scars. Anything created by a lamia shows a bent toward the grotesque, evoking cruelty or pain. To cover their creative lack, lamias become avid collectors of all kinds of art and patrons of artists. Good-aligned lamias strive to surround themselves with things they find truly beautiful, but even they fall prey to reflecting darker appetites in their collections. Lamias who embrace their dark nature create collections that glorify lust, violence, and power.": "反映了这种凝固的美，该种族遭受了创造能力的阻碍。真正的艺术家几乎闻所未闻，而那些试图创作的拉米亚人往往诉诸于从他人那里窃取灵感，只是为了创作出展示该种族心理伤痕的作品。拉米亚人创造的任何东西都显示出对怪诞的偏爱，唤起残忍或痛苦。为了掩盖他们创造力的不足，拉米亚人成为各种艺术的狂热收藏家和艺术家的赞助人。善良的拉米亚人努力用他们认为真正美丽的东西包围自己，但即使是他们也会在他们的收藏品中反映出黑暗的欲望。拥抱自己黑暗本性的拉米亚人创造了美化欲望、暴力和权力的收藏。",
	"Lamia culture is cutthroat at the best of times. Dominated by the powerful matriarchs, lamia society is characterized by self-interest, pleasure-seeking, and deadly oneupmanship. Concepts like remorse and compassion are alien to most lamias, forcing any who recognize the twisted nature of their existence to hide their qualms or flee. Concepts like monogamy and familial affection are likewise all but unknown. Although both male and female lamias exist, females outnumber males by three to one.": "拉米亚文化在最好的时候也是残酷的。在强大的女族长的支配下，拉米亚社会的特点是自我利益、追求快乐和致命的竞争。像悔恨和同情这样的概念对大多数拉米亚人来说是陌生的，迫使任何认识到他们存在的扭曲性质的人隐藏他们的疑虑或逃离。像一夫一妻制和家庭感情这样的概念也同样不为人知。虽然男性和女性拉米亚人都存在，但女性的数量要比男性多三倍。",
	"As a result of their gender ratios combined with their highly matriarchal nature, trysts between female lamias are as common as between male and female. Assignations between lamias occur for power and pleasure, never for love—a concept revolting to most of the race. Even pairings that produce offspring have no special significance to the parents. Young lamias are left to fend for themselves almost immediately after birth, since their culture emphasizes that survival engenders strength.": "由于他们的性别比例与他们高度的母系性质相结合，女性拉米亚人之间的尝试与男性和女性之间的尝试一样普遍。拉米亚人之间的分配是为了权力和快乐，而不是为了爱情--这是大多数种族所反感的概念。即使是产生后代的配对，对父母也没有特殊意义。年轻的拉米亚人几乎在出生后就被留在那里自生自灭，因为他们的文化强调，生存会产生力量。",
	"Lamias have abysmal relationships with other races, who rightly view them with fear and revulsion despite their intense beauty. The lamias see other creatures as little more than playthings yet to be broken. They might form temporary alliances to pursue a common agenda or even take a lover of another race they find attractive or interesting, but such dalliances never last. The so-called \"false lamias,\" those with lower bodies of great cats, drive lamias into a murderous frenzy. Serpentine lamias will go to any lengths to destroy these pretenders.": "拉米亚人与其他种族的关系糟糕透顶，尽管他们有着强烈的美貌，但他们理所当然地以恐惧和厌恶的眼光看待他们。在拉米亚人眼中，其他生物不过是有待打破的玩物而已。他们可能会结成临时联盟，以追求共同的目标，甚至是找一个他们认为有吸引力或有趣的另一个种族的情人，但这种关系永远不会持久。所谓的 \"假拉米亚人\"，即那些拥有大猫下半身的人，使拉米亚人陷入杀人的狂热。蛇形拉米亚人将不惜一切代价摧毁这些伪装者。",
	"Lamia society has little use for religion or gods, and clerics and other representatives of the divine are unheard of among them. Magic and mysticism, however, is deeply ingrained in lamia culture. Practitioners of arcane magic are as common as divine spellcasters are rare. Lamias show reverence to only one thing—the moon. Many of their rites center around the moon and take place under its light. Those lamias who reject their corrupt upbringing reject the racial hatred of the divine and seek comfort in devotion to deities, particularly those associated with the moon.": "拉米亚社会对宗教或神灵没有什么用处，神职人员和其他神灵的代表在他们中间闻所未闻。然而，魔法和神秘主义在拉米亚文化中根深蒂固。神秘魔法的练习者很常见，而神圣的施法者却很少。拉米亚人只对一种东西表示敬意--月亮。他们的许多仪式都是围绕着月亮进行的，并在月亮的光辉下进行。那些拒绝腐朽教养的拉米亚人拒绝对神灵的种族仇恨，并在对神灵的奉献中寻求安慰，特别是那些与月亮有关的神灵。",

Each remaining district holds a yearly memorial festival in the honor of those lost souls.": "曾经有更多的拉玛加尼区，但自帝国灭亡以来的悲剧让这个城市付出了代价。这些灾难中最突出的是一场被称为奥术消亡的魔法瘟疫，它撕裂了拉玛加尼的一个区附近的土地。自然魔法的拉玛格人非常容易受到这种疾病的影响，它迅速地蹂躏了当地的居民，以至于城市其他地区的唯一希望就是切断通往那里的过境门。倒塌为通往该区的门户提供动力的巨石很可能拯救了这个种族，但它注定了许多人的命运。剩下的每个区每年都会举行纪念节，以纪念那些失去的灵魂。",
	"Ramag culture revolves around the guardianship and maintenance of the magical monoliths that connect their precious city. The creation of a new monolith is a monumental two-step process. After the physical monolithis constructed, the first step is an incantation that all ramag learn as a rite of passage. It binds their souls to the new monolith, even after death. The second step occurs after a ramag's death, when his or her remains are interred within the appropriate monolith. Many years pass between these steps, so successfully empowering a new monolith is a cause for great celebration.": "拉玛格文化是围绕着守护和维护连接他们宝贵城市的神奇石碑而展开的。创建一个新的石碑是一个具有纪念意义的两步过程。在实体石碑建成后，第一步是所有拉玛格人都要学习的咒语，作为一种成年仪式。它将他们的灵魂与新石碑结合在一起，即使在死后也是如此。第二步发生在拉玛格人死后，当他或她的遗体被安葬在适当的石碑中时。在这两个步骤之间要经过许多年，所以成功地赋予一个新的石碑以权力是一个值得庆祝的理由。",
	"New monoliths provide additional stability for the magical flows of energy that crisscross the land, or replace a damaged or failing monolith that supports one of the many gates of Ramagani. All told, the monolith network powers two or three gateway arches in each district of the city, and the portals all link to Ramagani's primary site. Should the wrong monoliths fail, entire districts of the city could be cut off from the rest of their race for unknown stretches of time.": "新的石碑为纵横交错的神奇能量流提供了额外的稳定性，或者替换损坏或失效的石碑，以支持拉玛甘尼的众多大门之一。总的来说，石碑网络为城市每个区的两到三个门户拱门提供动力，而这些门户都与拉玛加尼的主要场所相连。如果错误的石碑发生故障，城市的整个地区可能会在未知的时间内被切断与其他种族的联系。",
	"Ramag rarely become adventurers, but they maintain several groups that cultivate similar skills. These groups come into contact with adventurers both within Ramagani and in the surrounding lands. The Wardens are specialists who travel the land following the flows of magic. The Wardens maintain the monoliths away from the city and are responsible for taming threads of the ancient magical web that become unstable. Many Wardens are wizards who dedicate their lives to the study of the web. Another group called the Scaled Keepers, comprised primarily of rangers, incubates pterodactyl eggs and rears the young. They train the creatures to serve as flying mounts for messengers and scouts.": "拉玛格人很少成为冒险家，但他们保持着几个培养类似技能的团体。这些团体在拉玛格内和周围的土地上都会与冒险者接触。守护者是跟随魔法的流动在这片土地上旅行的专家。守护者负责维护远离城市的巨石，并负责驯服变得不稳定的古老魔网的线。许多守护者都是致力于研究魔网的巫师，他们将自己的生命奉献给了魔网。另一个名为 \"鳞片守护者 \"的团体，主要由游侠组成，负责孵化翼龙蛋和抚养幼龙。他们训练这些生物作为信使和侦察员的飞行坐骑。",
	"The other specialized ramag orders remain mostly within the city. First among them is the Stormwatch—a garrison that watches the walls of each Ramagani node. Its members operate magical lightning ballistae that help secure the city. Powered by the monoliths and fed by the magical flows, these siege engines give the city's districts a deadly edge. Stormwatch members join the garrison for life, and each is considered vital from the lowest ranks to the highest echelons of command. The other major group centered within Ramagani is the Gatekeepers, overseers who keep watch over the Wall of Gates. The Wall bears a range of ancient portals that occasionally spark to life, reopening lost paths and exposing the city to both lost artifacts and knowledge and sudden peril. The Gatekeepers drive back threats that emerge from the gates and occasionally oversee expeditions through stable portals.": "其他专门的拉玛格命令大多留在城市里。首先是 \"风暴守卫\"--一支在每个拉玛格尼节点的城墙上监视的守卫部队。它的成员操作着神奇的闪电弹弓，帮助保护城市的安全。这些攻城引擎由巨石提供动力，并由魔法流提供能量，给城市的各个区带来了致命的优势。风暴监视的成员终身加入驻军，从最底层到最高层的指挥，每个人都被认为是至关重要的。另一个以拉玛加尼为中心的主要团体是守门员，他们是监视门墙的监督者。长城上有一系列古老的门户，它们偶尔会冒出生命的火花，重新打开失去的道路，使城市面临失去的文物和知识以及突然的危险。守门人驱赶着从门中出现的威胁，并偶尔监督通过稳定门户的探险活动。",
	"Ramag names borrow heavily from the history of the titan empire scattered throughout Ramagani and other ruins, and from tales passed down through the ages.": "拉玛格的名字很大程度上借用了散落在拉玛格尼和其他遗迹中的泰坦帝国的历史，以及流传于世的故事。",
	"Baarkhul, Dirjahat, Fakharizan, Irkuat, Jirindehkal, Suuldjarat, Uan, Zinchera": "Baarkhul, Dirjahat, Fakharizan, Irkuat, Jirindehkal, Suuldjarat, Uan, Zinchera",

The ancient empire described in the ramag history is the former homeland of Glorious Umbuso, the lost titan empire of the Southlands.": "拉玛格在{@i Midgard Campaign Setting}出现在南地的遗弃之地区域。拉玛格历史中描述的古老帝国是光荣的翁布索的故乡，是南地失落的泰坦帝国。",
	"In Midgard, the magical web in which the ramag race's history is ensnared is a great, crisscrossing net of ley lines. The ramag monoliths stabilize the ley lines and keep them from drifting and twisting, but many remain uncontrolled. The ley lines effects are unpredictable, and even skilled ley spellcasters tread carefully near the remnants of the web.": "在米德加德，拉玛格人的历史被卷入的魔网是一张巨大的、纵横交错的雷线网。拉玛格人的石碑稳定了雷线，使它们不至于漂移和扭曲，但许多雷线仍然不受控制。绳索的效果是不可预测的，即使是熟练的绳索施法者也要小心翼翼地靠近网络的残余部分。",
	"Sahuagin come of age in their late teens. Though age takes its toll, there is no known upper limit to sahuagin lifespan.": "萨瓦金人在十几岁的时候就成年了。虽然年龄会带来损失，但萨瓦金人的寿命没有已知的上限。",
	"Their regimented nature marks sahuagin as universally lawful, and nearly all are evil. Sea devils who buck these trends are either killed or exiled, accounting for the occasional sahuagin adventurer.": "他们的制度化性质标志着萨瓦金人普遍是合法的，而且几乎所有的人都是邪恶的。违背这些趋势的海魔不是被杀就是被流放，偶尔也有萨瓦金人的冒险者。",

	"Death rises from the depths to claim intruders with the mournful wail of conch shell horns, shadows beneath the waves, and fins slicing through the water. The cruel and ravenous sahuagin—also known as sea devils—thrive where other aquatic races founder. A wickedly perfect fusion of humanoid and shark, sahuagin glide through the ocean in search of prey and conquest.": "死亡从深处升起，伴随着海螺壳角的悲鸣，海浪下的阴影，以及划过水面的鱼鳍，向入侵者索取。残忍而贪婪的萨瓦金--也被称为海魔--在其他水生种族的地方繁衍。sahuagin是人形和鲨鱼的邪恶的完美融合，它在海洋中滑行，寻找猎物和征服。",
	"Great cities darken the ocean floors where the sea devils dwell, and coastal fortresses in shallower waters and reefs expand their influence to the boundary between sea and land. Bloodthirsty yet methodical, the sahuagin brutally defend their territory beneath the waves, primarily against the aquatic elves, their ancient foes. Sharks are drawn to the sea devils and easily fall beneath their sway, creating a tide of fins and fangs and blood to sweep over the world's oceans.": "伟大的城市使海魔居住的海底变得黑暗，在较浅的水域和珊瑚礁中的沿海堡垒将他们的影响扩大到海洋和陆地之间的边界。嗜血但有条不紊，萨瓦金人残酷地捍卫着他们在海面下的领地，主要是针对水生精灵，他们古老的敌人。鲨鱼被海魔所吸引，很容易就被它们所左右，形成了一股鱼鳍、獠牙和鲜血的潮流，席卷了全世界的海洋。",
	"About 7 feet tall and weighing over 250 pounds, sahuagin are built to hunt. Solidly muscular, the sea devils are humanoid in basic shape with horns and membranes that form frills down the spine and along a powerful, lashing tail. Similar structures form distinctive ear frills on the sides of their heads, and their hand and feet are webbed. Fingers end in hard claws, and a sahuagin's wide mouth is filled with multiple rows of sharklike teeth.": "萨瓦金人身高约7英尺，体重超过250磅，为狩猎而生。海魔的肌肉结实，基本形状与人相似，有角和膜，在脊柱上形成褶皱，并沿着强有力的甩尾。类似的结构在它们的头部两侧形成独特的耳垂，它们的手和脚都有蹼。手指末端是坚硬的爪子，萨瓦金人宽大的嘴里长满了多排鲨鱼般的牙齿。",
	"Their skin is incredibly thick, rivaling leather armor in terms of protection. Sahuagin skin tones range from dark green to dusty blue along the back of the body, fading to lighter shades on the creature's underbelly. Frills and fins can be yellow, red, orange, or pink, in contrast to the base skin color. Sometimes mutations occur, and the more powerful and feared sahuagin warlords sport four arms or sharklike tails instead of legs. Primarily aquatic, sahuagin can survive for several hours at a time on dry land, though they are extremely uncomfortable out of water.": "他们的皮肤非常厚，在保护方面可与皮甲媲美。萨瓦金人的肤色范围从深绿色到沿着身体背面的尘土蓝色，在生物的腹下渐渐变成浅色的色调。褶边和鳍可以是黄色、红色、橙色或粉红色，与基本的皮肤颜色形成对比。有时会发生变异，更强大和令人畏惧的萨瓦金军阀会有四只手臂或鲨鱼般的尾巴，而不是腿。萨瓦金人主要是水生动物，可以在干燥的陆地上一次生存几个小时，尽管他们离开水后会感到非常不舒服。",
	"Although they can survive in fresh water, sahuagin prefer warm bodies of salt water at depths of at least 100 feet. Temperature and pressure are no obstacle to them, and they build great settlements of stone and coral on the lightless ocean floor. Sahuagin cities are honeycombed with spherical chambers and cylindrical tunnels. Most structures in a sahuagin settlement sport doors and corridors wide enough to accommodate swimming sharks. If the city is close enough to the surface to catch light, sahuagin cultivate beds of seaweed to provide padding and comfort in their otherwise unfurnished living chambers.": "虽然他们可以在淡水中生存，但萨瓦金人更喜欢至少100英尺深的温暖的盐水体。温度和压力对它们来说都不是障碍，它们在无光的海底用石头和珊瑚建造巨大的定居点。萨瓦金人的城市是蜂窝状的球形房间和圆柱形隧道。萨瓦金人定居点中的大多数建筑都有足够宽的门和走廊，足以容纳游泳的鲨鱼。如果城市离海面足够近，可以捕捉到光线，萨瓦金人就会种植海草床，为他们没有家具的房间提供衬垫和舒适。",
	"Despite their monstrous appearance and bloodthirsty nature, sahuagin are highly civilized, and they prize intellect, order, and structure. The most powerful sahuagin in a city or settlement rules under the title of \"Lord of Blood and Battle,\" and the remainder of the society breaks into two main castes: nobles and commoners. Despite the social strata a given sahaugin is born into, all sea devils receive a mandatory education. Most of this training revolves around battle and tactics, but the sahuagin keep a meticulous oral history. Sahuagin life is cruel and brutal within this rigid structure, filled with the constant struggle of the weak brutalized by the strong.": "尽管萨瓦金人的外表很怪异，而且嗜血成性，但他们的文明程度很高，他们重视智力、秩序和结构。一个城市或定居点中最强大的萨瓦金人以 \"血与战之主 \"的头衔进行统治，而社会的其余部分则分为两个主要阶层：贵族和平民。尽管一个特定的萨哈金人出生在哪个社会阶层，所有的海魔都接受强制性教育。这种训练大多围绕着战斗和战术，但萨瓦金人保留着细致的口述历史。在这种僵化的结构中，萨瓦金人的生活是残酷的，充满了弱者被强者残害的不断斗争。",
	"The clergy represents a notable exception to the caste system that dominates sahuagin society. Only female sahuagin are seen as worth of channeling divine power, and male sahuagin clerics are unheard of. The chief concern of sahuagin clergy is the interpretation and maintenance of the tlalloc, an ancient and extremely accurate calendar. The tlalloc is a massive stone or coral disc covered in intricate carvings that also serves as the altar. The priestesses track significant events and preside over holy rites during momentous moments.": "神职人员是主导萨瓦金社会的种姓制度的一个明显的例外。只有女性萨瓦金人被视为有资格输送神力，而男性萨瓦金神职人员则闻所未闻。萨瓦金神职人员的主要关注点是解释和维护tlalloc，一种古老而极其精确的日历。tlalloc是一个巨大的石头或珊瑚圆盘，上面有复杂的雕刻，也是祭坛。女祭司追踪重大事件，并在重要时刻主持神圣的仪式。",
	"The sahuagin religion claims that the first shark people came from a strange place in the deepest trenches of the ocean. Supposedly, these ancient sahuagin carried the first tlalloc calendar stone with them when they emerged from the crushing black depths. Sharks are venerated as the perfect symbol of power, hunger, and dominion over the oceans. Temple structures serve as hatcheries for schools of sharks, and the creatures cluster around the temples awaiting the bidding of the sea devils.": "萨瓦金教声称，第一批鲨鱼人来自海洋最深的海沟中的一个奇怪地方。据推测，这些古老的萨瓦金人在从破碎的黑色深渊中出来时，携带了第一块特拉洛克日历石。鲨鱼被尊为权力、饥饿和对海洋统治的完美象征。寺庙建筑是鲨鱼群的孵化场，这些生物聚集在寺庙周围，等待海魔的命令。",
	"Sahuagin rule their territory ruthlessly and efficiently, demonstrating the most dangerous qualities of intelligent beings and sharks. The sea devils rarely form alliances with outsiders or even other aquatic races of similar temperament, viewing all other ocean-dwellers as competition for food and territory. Parties of sahuagin patrol up to 50 miles from their home settlements on hunting, scouting, and raiding excursions. Non‑sahuagin encountered can expect an inhospitable welcome.": "萨瓦金人无情而有效地统治着他们的领地，表现出智慧生物和鲨鱼最危险的品质。海魔人很少与外来者甚至是其他气质相似的水生种族结成联盟，他们将所有其他海洋居民视为食物和领土的竞争。萨瓦金人的队伍在离他们的家乡定居点长达50英里的地方巡逻，进行狩猎、侦察和突袭。遇到的非萨瓦金人可以期待一个不友好的欢迎。",
	"No other race that crosses currents with the sahuagin kindles such extreme and undying hatred in them as the aquatic elves. War between these two races is frequent, prolonged, and bloody. The reason for this mutual hatred is shrouded in mystery, but a connection between the races certainly exists, proved by the existence of the malenti. Malenti are rare sahuagin, sometimes born when a settlement of sea elves exists within close proximity to a sahuagin community. The malenti, though racially sahuagin, look exactly like aquatic elves. Most are killed at birth, but a few survive to serve as spies and assassins who can slip into the ranks of the sea devils' ancient foes.": "没有任何一个与萨瓦金人同流合污的种族能像水生精灵一样，在他们心中燃起如此极端和不朽的仇恨。这两个种族之间的战争是频繁的、长期的、血腥的。这种相互仇恨的原因被蒙上了一层神秘的面纱，但种族之间的联系肯定是存在的，马伦蒂的存在就证明了这一点。Malenti是罕见的萨瓦金人，有时当海精灵的定居点靠近萨瓦金人社区时就会诞生。Malenti，虽然在种族上是萨瓦金人，但看起来完全像水生精灵。大多数人在出生时就被杀死了，但也有少数人幸存下来，成为间谍和刺客，可以溜进海魔的古老敌人的行列。",
	"Sahuagin have a single name that starts with a single syllable at birth and grows more complex over the course of their lives. The core of the name is a short, personal one, occasionally with an addition due to a powerful lineage or ancestor. Deeds throughout a sahuagin's life add new syllables, culminating in a lengthy, complex title that conveys great glory and prestige.": "萨瓦金人有一个单一的名字，在出生时以一个音节开始，在他们的生活过程中越来越复杂。名字的核心是一个简短的、个人的名字，偶尔会因为强大的血统或祖先而增加一个。萨瓦金人一生中的所作所为会增加新的音节，最终形成一个冗长、复杂的头衔，传达出巨大的荣耀和威望。",
