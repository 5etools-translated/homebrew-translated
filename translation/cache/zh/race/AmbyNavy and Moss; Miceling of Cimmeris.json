	"Miceling are most aptly described as mice made humanoid. Completely black eyes, large furred ears and a long tail are amongst the most recognisable traits of a miceling. Such qualities are best put to use in speed and stealth, and listening to the natural instincts written in their souls.": "米林最恰当的描述是老鼠变成人形。完全黑色的眼睛、大毛的耳朵和长尾巴是miceling最容易识别的特征之一。这样的品质最好用在速度和隐蔽性上，并听从写在他们灵魂里的自然本能。",
	"Miceling have the following racial traits:": "米克林有以下种族特征。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against being {@condition deafened}. You gain {@sense blindsight} out to 30ft but are considered completely blind when {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened}.": "你对被（%0%）的拯救有优势。你在30英尺范围内获得（1%），但在（2%）和（3%）时被视为完全失明。",
	"Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.": "你的灵巧得分增加2，你的智慧得分增加1。",
	"Most miceling mature at around 10 years old and live about a decade longer than humans.": "大多数miceling在10岁左右成熟，比人类多活十年左右。",

	"You can speak, read and write Common, Miceri and Miceri-mou, a developing variant on Miceri designed to be easier for humans to speak compared to the squeaks and various other noises that make up standard Miceri.": "你可以说、读、写普通话、米凯里语和米凯里语，米凯里语是一种发展中的变体，与构成标准米凯里语的吱吱声和其他各种声音相比，旨在让人类更容易说话。",

	"Thanks to your soft, padded soles, you are proficient in {@skill Stealth}. ": "由于你的软垫鞋底，你精通（%0%）。",
	"The identifiable features are mouse-like ears hidden within the hair, covering where ears would sit on any other humanoid species. Ears of miceling are better built for listening and identifying sound, thanks to a vastly greater range of motion than standard human ears. Thanks to this, miceling can perceive their surroundings with their hearing only if necessary. Eyes of miceling are typically completely black, beady and reflective, often reflecting a specific colour. giving the eyes more depth — with these eyes comes much better eyesight in darkness.": "可识别的特征是隐藏在毛发中的老鼠般的耳朵，覆盖在任何其他类人物种的耳朵位置上。由于miceling的耳朵比标准人类的耳朵有更大的活动范围，因此它更适合于倾听和识别声音。正因为如此，miceling只有在必要时才能用他们的听觉来感知周围的环境。miceling的眼睛通常是完全黑色的，炯炯有神，反光，经常反射出一种特定的颜色，使眼睛更有深度--有了这种眼睛，在黑暗中的视力就会好很多。",
	"Miceling also bare tails, albeit more varied in form that their muroid counterparts. Some have more standard, mouse-like tails while the majority have a slight layer of fur. Tails vary depending on where a miceling was born and who from. Similarly, the soles of miceling feet are also covered in a fine layer of fur as well as having pawpads, allowing them to move quieter than most.": "鼠类也有裸露的尾巴，尽管在形式上比它们的喰种更加多样。有些人的尾巴更标准，像老鼠一样，而大多数人的尾巴有一层轻微的毛。尾巴的变化取决于miceling的出生地和来源。同样，miceling的脚底也覆盖着一层细小的皮毛，并有爪垫，使它们能够比大多数动物更安静地移动。",
	"Miceling have slimmer statures, and have a harder time packing on muscle than other species. Speed is something miceling essential, as they often have to evade bigger creatures and escape. Therefore, what muscle they can get is often in their legs and core, allowing them to run faster and with more confidence.": "Miceling的身材比较瘦小，比其他物种更难长出肌肉。速度是miceling必不可少的东西，因为它们经常要躲避更大的生物和逃跑。因此，他们能得到的肌肉往往是在他们的腿和核心部位，使他们能够跑得更快，更有信心。",
	"Miceling are vegetarian creatures, due to the inability for their digestive system to process meat. Therefore, many miceling live in forests and other areas where natural, plant-based food is plentiful.": "米林是素食动物，因为它们的消化系统无法处理肉类。因此，许多miceling生活在森林和其他地区，那里有丰富的天然植物性食物。",
	"Keeping to themselves even within their own community, miceling are a relatively uncommon people in most modern societies, with only a few deciding to integrate with the rest of the world and their towns and cities. Rural miceling live within spiral homes made of twine, wood and soft materials, constructed in fields or forests. When left without the luxury of a home, miceling dig small burrows into soil or find somewhere small and dry where they can curl up, usually with a second escape route.": "即使在自己的社区内也保持自我，miceling是大多数现代社会中比较少见的民族，只有少数人决定与世界其他地方和他们的城镇融合。农村的miceling住在用麻绳、木头和软材料制成的螺旋形房屋里，建在田野或森林里。当没有豪华的家时，miceling会在土壤中挖小洞，或找一个小而干燥的地方蜷缩起来，通常有第二条逃生路线。",
	"Miceling share a root language called Miceri that comes naturally to them thanks to bearing ears more suited to hearing the squeaks and higher pitched sounds of Miceri that others cannot. It contains a lot of clicking noises, high pitched squeaks outside of the range of some creatures' hearing, and has a soothing rhythm when spoken. As more miceling spend time with other humans, some have begun to develop a dialect that others without their hearing can learn and be proficient in, currently known as Miceri-Mou. Thanks to also being part-human, miceling are able to speak Common and other languages like it.": "Miceling有一种叫做Miceri的根基语言，由于他们的耳朵更适合听Miceri的吱吱声和更高音调的声音，而其他人则不能。它包含大量的点击声，以及一些生物听觉范围之外的高音调尖叫声，并且在说话时有一种舒缓的节奏。随着越来越多的miceling与其他人类相处，一些人已经开始发展出一种方言，没有听力的人可以学习并熟练掌握，目前被称为Miceri-Mou。由于也是人类的一部分，miceling能够说普通话和其他类似语言。"
