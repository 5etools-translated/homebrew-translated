	"{@i Butcher} is, without a doubt, a dark item. Not evil per se, but dark. When you introduce it into your game it is going to lead to conflict. With monsters, with NPCs.....with party members. Be aware of that. Butcher is the saying 'for the greater good', forged in steel and made physical. After all, why not kill those who deserve it if it means you can protect those you love? An easy choice for some, an impossible task for others. To really spark a story, consider giving the weapon to someone who sits in between those two extremes.

Oh, the weapon might get discarded at some point, but with a bit of luck, you'll get some damn fine roleplay out of it first.": "{@i Butcher}毫无疑问是一个黑暗的项目。本身并不邪恶，但却是黑暗的。当你把它引入你的游戏时，它将会导致冲突。与怪物，与NPCs.....，与党员。要意识到这一点。屠夫是 \"为了更大的利益 \"的说法，在钢铁中锻造，并被制成实物。毕竟，如果这意味着你可以保护你所爱的人，为什么不杀那些值得杀的人呢？对一些人来说，这是一个简单的选择，对另一些人来说，这是一个不可能完成的任务。要想真正引发一个故事，可以考虑把武器交给处于这两个极端之间的人。这个人拥有凶猛和忠诚，可以看到这个物品的用途，但又有心知道这是不对的。哦，这个武器可能会在某个时候被丢弃，但如果运气好的话，你会先从它身上得到一些该死的好的角色扮演。",
