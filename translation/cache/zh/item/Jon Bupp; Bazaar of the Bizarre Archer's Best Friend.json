The arrows vanish with no effect if they miss their intended target. The phantom bow fires 1d20 + 40 of these arrows, after which point the bow vanishes. Normal and magical arrows can also be fired from this weapon, but magical arrows gain no additional attack bonus. Each normal arrow fired from the bow gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, these arrows can be fired without detracting from the bow's longevity (i.e., the bow's magic is not decreased by firing normal arrows).": "这似乎是一张透明的弓，上面有一根闪光的弦。当弦被拉回时，会出现一支闪闪发光的箭。发光的箭在攻击和伤害卷上提供+2的奖励。如果箭没有射中预定的目标，则会消失，没有任何效果。幻影弓发射了1d20+40支这样的箭，之后弓就消失了。普通箭和魔法箭也可以用这种武器发射，但魔法箭没有额外的攻击加成。从弓上射出的每支普通箭都会获得攻击和伤害卷的+1奖励。此外，这些箭可以在不影响弓的寿命的情况下发射（也就是说，弓的魔力不会因为发射普通箭而减少）。",

Every day at dawn, if it only contains a single arrow it magically refills itself, with up to a dozen arrows.

	"This entire arrow is made of a special, magical metal. When fired at nonliving rock, this missile automatically hits its intended target, into which the arrow sinks, leaving around 6 inches of the rear of its shaft exposed. A small steel ring is set into the rear of this arrow, to which can be tied a thin line or cord. The  arrow of piercing  is reusable; in order to retrieve the arrow, the archer must simply grasp the arrow firmly with both hands and pull it from its target. This arrow actually bounces off any fleshy creature at which it is fired (doing no damage), but it acts as an  arrow of harm  against any live or animated target composed of stone (e.g., stone golem,etc.), doing double damage. Additionally, it will instantly slay any creature that has been petrified if it fails a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If the petrified target succeeds, it takes double normal damage.": "这整支箭是由一种特殊的、神奇的金属制成。当向非生物岩石发射时，这种导弹会自动击中预定的目标，箭头沉入其中，留下约6英寸的箭杆后部露出。在这种箭的后部有一个小钢环，可以在上面系上一条细线或绳子。穿心箭是可以重复使用的；为了取回箭，弓箭手必须用双手紧紧抓住箭，把它从目标中拉出来。这种箭实际上会被射向的任何肉体生物弹开（不造成伤害），但它对任何由石头组成的活体或动画目标（如石雕等）起到伤害箭的作用，造成双重伤害。此外，如果任何被石化的生物未能通过DC12宪法规定的投掷，它将立即杀死该生物。如果被石化的目标成功了，它将受到双倍的正常伤害。",
