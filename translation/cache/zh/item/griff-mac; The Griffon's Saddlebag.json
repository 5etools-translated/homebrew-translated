	"Tiroth held out the small box to her. She looked at him, puzzled: the flickering firelight of the tavern's hearth perfectly catching her graceful half-orc features.

He held his breath as she opened the lid.": "Tiroth向她伸出了小盒子。她不解地看着他：酒馆壁炉中闪烁的火光完美地捕捉到她优雅的半兽人特征。在过去的五天里，他一直在研究这个问题，自己一个人呆着，让他火热的铁皮人血液经受风雪中寒冷咆哮的风的考验。不过，如果是为了她，这一切都是值得的。当她打开盖子时，他屏住呼吸。",
	"The warm light of the room was suddenly met with a cooling blue, and a small cloud of fog hung in the air as she let out a slight gasp. She gently lifted the crystalline amulet from the box, its shape shimmering and slowly reforming in a fractal kaleidoscope of patterns. A prism of heavenly hues danced on the table as the glinting snowflake pendant danced as she held it.": "房间里温暖的光线突然遇到了冷却的蓝色，当她发出轻微的喘息声时，一小团雾气笼罩在空气中。她轻轻地从盒子里举起水晶护身符，它的形状闪闪发光，慢慢地重新形成了一个分形的万花筒图案。当她拿着闪闪发光的雪花吊坠时，天堂般的色调的棱镜在桌子上舞动。",

The arms stay attached to your torso at all times and cannot be moved to other parts of your body, but can be turned around to face the opposite direction.": "这些手镯可以在你现有的手臂下面召唤出另一对手臂。幽灵手臂可以用一个动作召唤出来，并在解散前持续一分钟。在活动期间，你可以用手臂来操纵一个物体，打开一个未上锁的门或容器，从一个打开的容器中存放或取回一个物品，或者从一个小瓶中倒出内容物。每只手臂可以携带多达10磅的物品。手臂在任何时候都与你的躯干相连，不能移动到你身体的其他部位，但可以转过来面向相反方向。",
	"In addition, the gems adorning the bracers can amplify the arms' strength for short bursts. The gems contain a total of 5 charges and recharge 1d4+1 each dawn. By uttering the bracers' command word using a bonus action and expending a charge, you can empower the arms to immediately make two unarmed weapon attacks against a target within five feet of you. The arms have a Strength modifier of +3 which is used when making the attack and use your proficiency bonus. Each strike does {@dice 1d4} magical bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. These attacks do not benefit from the Monk's Martial Arts ability.": "此外，装饰在手镯上的宝石可以在短时间内放大手臂的力量。宝石总共有5次充能，每次黎明充能1d4+1。通过使用额外行动说出手镯的命令词并消耗一次充能，你可以赋予手臂力量，使其立即对你5英尺内的目标进行两次徒手武器攻击。手臂的力量修正值为+3，在进行攻击时使用，并使用你的熟练度奖励。每次攻击在成功命中后都会造成{@dice 1d4}的魔法打击伤害。这些攻击并不受益于僧侣的武术能力。",

	"In addition, this trident acts as a conduit for the sky's ferocious power. Immediately after hitting a creature with the trident, you can call down a bolt of lightning upon it, forcing it and all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take {@dice 6d10} lightning damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw if they're submerged in water or wearing metal armor. You are immune to the lightning damage caused by this effect. This ability fails if the creatures are obstructed from the sky. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.": "此外，这个三叉戟可以作为天空凶猛力量的通道。在用三叉戟击中一个生物后，你可以立即向它召唤一道闪电，迫使它和5英尺范围内的所有生物做出DC16灵巧的救赎动作。拯救失败时，生物会受到{@dice 6d10}的闪电伤害，成功时则受到一半的伤害。如果生物被淹没在水中或穿着金属盔甲，则在救赎中处于劣势。你对这个效果造成的雷电伤害免疫。如果生物被天空阻挡，则该能力失效。一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再这样做，直到下一个黎明。",
	"You can use your action to try to impale and pull a creature toward you.

If you succeed, you can pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you.": "你可以用你的行动来尝试刺穿并拉动一个生物到你身边。如果你的目标是一个不比你大一号的生物，你可以用三叉戟对它进行一次远程武器攻击。如果你命中了，你可以尝试将被刺穿的生物拉向你，方法是用目标的力量（竞技）检定来争夺目标的力量（竞技）检定。如果你成功了，你可以将该生物拉向你，最多 20 英尺。",
	"With a final, thunderous cry, Corryn hurled the trident downward. It found its mark and buried itself in the great beast's shell: finding purchase within the gashes left by her fallen comrades.

	"The surrounding water hissed and crackled as it vaporized, and the fearsome creature let out a final, defiant cry.

	"The crossbow comes with a special needle-like bolt that is magically bound to it. When fired, this bolt leaves a faint thread of ethereal energy behind it as it flies. Creatures struck by the bolt take force damage instead of piercing, as it effortlessly passes through them. Immediately after making an attack, the bolt flies back to the crossbow and reloads itself neatly, making it immediately ready for another shot. When the needle-like bolt is used, this crossbow ignores the loading property.": "十字弓带有一个特殊的针状箭，被神奇地绑在上面。当发射时，这支弩箭在飞行过程中会在身后留下一道微弱的空灵能量线。被弩箭击中的生物会受到力的伤害，而不是穿透，因为它毫不费力地穿过它们。在进行攻击后，弩箭会立即飞回十字弓，并整齐地重新装填，使其立即准备好再次射击。当使用针状弓箭时，这种弩箭忽略了装填的特性。",
	"This weapon has 4 charges, recharging {@dice 1d4} each dawn.

Squasher functions as a normal magical greatclub if the wielder is not a Druid.": "这个巨大的、有魔力的壁球具有奇特的耐久性。持有Squasher的德鲁伊精通该武器，并且可以使用他们的智慧修正值来进行攻击和伤害卷，而不是使用力量。如果持有者不是德鲁伊，斯夸舍的功能与普通的魔法大棒一样。",

	"While constricted, a creature cannot move or be more than 10' away from you in any direction, and your speed is halved. If you drop the whip while a creature is gripped by the tentacle, both your and the creature's movement returns to normal, although the tentacle will continue to hold and damage the creature until it breaks free.": "在被束缚时，生物不能在任何方向上移动或离开你超过10英尺，而且你的速度减半。如果你在生物被触手抓住的时候放下鞭子，你和生物的行动都会恢复正常，尽管触手会继续抓住并伤害生物，直到它挣脱。",
	"This icy shield has three charges, recharging them all each dawn. When a creature you can see hits you with a melee weapon attack, you may use a charge as your reaction (after receiving the damage) to deal {@dice 2d4} cold damage back to the attacker, granting you that same amount of damage as temporary hit points for up to one minute.": "这个冰盾有三次充能，每次黎明时分都会充能。当你能看到的生物用近战武器攻击你时，你可以使用一个充能作为你的反应（在收到伤害后），对攻击者造成（%0%）的寒冷伤害，给予你相同数量的伤害作为临时命中率，时间长达1分钟。",
	"The flail has three charges and regains {@dice 1d3} each dawn. You can cast thunderwave at first level while attuned to this weapon by expending one of these charges as an action (save DC 14).

	"The ball of the flail is attached to the chain with a powerful electrical connection, but can be released at will. You can make a ranged weapon attack to fling the ball at a creature you can see within 20/60 feet, or a point you can see within range.

Once activated, these cantrips can be cast at-will by the wielder using their spellcasting modifier. If they do not have a spellcasting modifier, use their Intelligence modifier instead.
