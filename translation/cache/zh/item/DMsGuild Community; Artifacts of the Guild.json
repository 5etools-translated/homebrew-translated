Sometimes the finger still appears in the possession of a stray undead, or a rogue necromancer.": "这根丑陋的、令人非常不舒服的指骨曾经属于一位富有的老太太，她在一系列悲惨的事故中失去了她的丈夫。有传言说她变得非常痛苦，她的手指变成了长长的爪子，用它来抓她的眼睛，并在家具上刻下他的名字。当她最终死去时，有人从她的尸体上取下了手指，希望将其出售。有时，这根手指仍然出现在一个流浪的亡灵，或一个无赖的死灵法师手中。",

In exchange for protection and \"benevolent governance\" the vampire took tribute in villagers for sustenance. Everam assaulted the stronghold, more out of habit than anything else. He battle the undead, and quickly realized he was out matched. In a desperate attempt to revitalize the depleted shield, he accidentally drew life from an imprisoned villager, slaying the poor man. It was at this point his will broke and his dark adversary overwhelmed him. He was not slain.

	"Eventually a young maiden, Lillian, was brought to the castle as a sacrifice by the cowed villagers. She was tough and fiery, and it was these traits that caused the people to select her, fearing her outspoken defiance would reach the castle and cause the Count to punish them. Instead they sought to appease him with her offering. She would not go quietly, and fought through the Dark Count's subtle charms and crushing grip, managing to strike and wound the powerful undead. In that moment Everam's lost hope reignited.": "最终，一个年轻的少女莉莉安被胆小的村民带到了城堡作为祭品。她坚韧而火热，正是这些特点导致人们选择了她，担心她直言不讳的反抗会传到城堡里，导致伯爵惩罚他们。相反，他们试图用她的提议来安抚他。她不会安静地离开，在黑暗伯爵微妙的魅力和粉碎性的控制中战斗，设法打击和伤害这个强大的亡灵。在那一刻，埃弗拉姆失去的希望重新燃起。",
