	"These arrows are very front-heavy because of the onepound ceramic container mounted at the end of the shaft, replacing the head of the arrow. These arrows can hold any alchemical substance from the core rules, such as alchemist's fire or acid. These arrows only require a touch attack to hit, but deal no damage. Instead they deliver the alchemical weapon to the target struck. Alchemist's arrows are destroyed when used and they cannot be recovered whether they hit or miss. In addition, they are quite fragile, and have been known to break when dropped, when the bearer is grappled or falls from a height, etc.": "这些箭是非常前重的，因为在箭杆的末端安装了一磅的陶瓷容器，代替了箭头。这些箭可以容纳核心规则中的任何炼金物质，如炼金术士的火或酸。这些箭只需要触摸攻击就能击中，但不造成伤害。相反，它们会将炼金武器传递给被击中的目标。炼金术士的箭在使用后会被摧毁，无论是否命中都无法恢复。此外，它们相当脆弱，已知在掉落、携带者被抓住或从高处跌落等情况下会破裂。",

	"These arrows have very narrow metal tips instead of a standard broad head, they appear much as a target arrow, but painfully sharp and heavier. Because of the small point of impact, the armour-piercing arrow can penetrate better through most armours. Wielding an armour-piercing arrow provides a +3 attack bonus to attack rolls against any target that has an armour bonus (natural, armour or shield).": "这些箭有非常窄的金属尖，而不是标准的宽头，它们看起来很像靶子的箭，但痛苦的锋利和更重。由于撞击点小，穿甲箭可以更好地穿透大多数盔甲。挥舞穿甲箭可以在对任何有护甲奖励（自然、护甲或盾牌）的目标进行攻击时提供+3的攻击奖励。",

	"The shaft of this arrow appears slightly larger in diameter than normal, with a much heavier head. In addition, upon close inspection, one can see a very fine crack along the shaft, up and through the head. When fired, the shaft separates into two parts, connected by a thin metal wire. On a successful hit, the two halves pass by the target on either side, letting the target be hit by the wire.": "这支箭的箭杆直径似乎比正常的要大一些，箭头要重得多。此外，经过仔细检查，人们可以看到沿箭杆向上并穿过箭头的一条非常细的裂缝。发射时，箭杆分离成两部分，由一根细金属丝连接。在成功击中时，两半从目标的两侧经过，让目标被金属丝击中。",
	"The two pieces of arrow, aided by momentum, then continue to wrap around the target, trapping and immobilizing him. The target is then considered grappled unless the creature makes a Dexterity save DC 14.": "两片箭矢在动力的帮助下，继续缠绕目标，将其困住并固定住。然后目标被认为是被抓住了，除非该生物做一个灵巧的救赎DC14。",
	"The creature thereafter, as an action can make an attempt to break the grapple against DC 16.  The Craft check to create a bola arrow is DC 20.": "此后，作为一个动作，该生物可以尝试挣脱抓捕，对抗DC16。 制作波拉箭的工艺检查是DC20。",
	"These arrows have broader, heavier heads designed for dealing massive damage and not for range. Broadheaded arrows deal damage as a weapon one size larger than the arrow normally deals. For example, in a standard short bow, broad head arrows deal 1d8 damage, and in a standard long bow, broad head arrows deal 1d10 damage.": "这些箭有更宽、更重的箭头，旨在造成巨大的伤害，而不是为了射程。阔头箭的伤害是比通常的箭大一个尺寸的武器。例如，在标准短弓中，宽头箭造成1d8的伤害，而在标准长弓中，宽头箭造成1d10的伤害。",
	"Also known as ropecutters or frog-crotch arrows. They are used for decapitating small game birds and in warfare by some asian cultures as an arrow that deals massive damage against lightly armoured targets. The arrows themselves are quite heavy-headed and are inaccurate at longer ranges. The arrow has an increased critical range 18-20.": "也被称为ropecutters或frog-crotch箭。它们被用来斩断小鸟的头颅，在战争中被一些亚洲文化用作对轻度装甲目标造成巨大伤害的箭。箭头本身是相当重的，在较远的距离上是不准确的。该箭的关键射程增加到18-20。",
	"Using a wide variety of noxious herbs, toxins, and less savory substances, the gas arrow creates a nauseating cloud when it hits its target. Instead of a pointed head, the tip of the arrow consists of a tightly bound pouch. When it impacts, the pouch ruptures, releasing a roiling green cloud that envelops a 5 ft. radius around the point of contact.... All targets within the area of effect must make a Constitution save (DC 12), or become {@condition Poisoned}, once the creature exits the cloud, at the beginning of its round the creature gets a save  to remove the condition. The cloud itself remains suspended for only a single round.": "气箭使用各种有毒的草药、毒素和不太可口的物质，当它击中目标时，会产生令人作呕的云。箭尖不是一个尖头，而是由一个紧密结合的小袋组成。当它撞击时，箭袋破裂，释放出一团绿色云雾，笼罩在接触点周围5英尺的范围内....。效果范围内的所有目标必须进行宪法救赎（DC12），否则会变成（%0%），一旦生物离开云层，在其回合开始时，生物会得到一次救赎以消除该状况。云层本身只停留在一个回合。",
	"The shaft just behind the head on each vial arrow is significantly larger than a typical arrow of its type, and the heads are modified hunting heads designed to be easily pulled free from a wound, each with several holes cut into them to allow liquids into the hollow shaft of the arrow. The reality is that most of these arrows are broken when used, but some (20%) remain intact at the scene of a battle, each containing an ounce of blood or ichor from the targets struck.": "每支小瓶箭的箭杆就在箭头后面，比一般的同类箭支要大得多，箭头是经过改良的猎头，设计成容易从伤口中拔出，每支箭上都有几个孔，可以让液体进入空心箭杆。现实情况是，这些箭在使用时大部分都被折断了，但有些（20%）在战斗现场仍然完好无损，每支箭都含有一盎司来自被击中目标的血液或ichor。",
	"Used primarily for signalling during a battle or as a warning by a sentry, whistling arrows are occasionally used to deliver a warning or on arrows that carry a note, making the arrow easier to find once fired. Whistling arrows create a very high-pitched sound when fired that is easily heard by anyone within 50 feet of the flight path of the arrow. Anyone within 300 feet of the flight of the arrow will hear it with a DC 10 perception check. Whistling arrows deal damage two dice smaller than a typical arrow in the style of bow used to fire it, because they are much lighter, and the head of the arrow has the grooves that create the distinctive whistling sound.": "哨子箭主要用于战斗中的信号或作为哨兵的警告，偶尔也用于传递警告，或用于带有音符的箭上，使箭在发射后更容易被发现。哨子箭在发射时产生非常高的音调，在箭的飞行路线50英尺内的人都能轻易听到。任何在箭的飞行路线300英尺内的人，只要进行DC10的感知检查就能听到它。哨子箭的伤害比用于发射的弓的典型箭小两个骰子，因为它们更轻，而且箭头上有产生独特哨声的凹槽。",
	"These arrows are effectively identical to a whistling arrow, but can only be heard by those creatures that can hear ultrasonics (such as dogs). Dogs who hear these arrows will either bark ferociously at them and pursue them, or will go quiet (if trained to react to a dog whistle).": "这些箭实际上与哨子箭相同，但只能被那些能听到超声波的生物（如狗）听到。听到这些箭的狗要么对它们凶猛地吠叫并追赶它们，要么就会安静下来（如果经过训练对狗哨有反应）。",
	"Creatures with Keen senses (Hearing) must make a Wisdom Save (DC 12) if they are within 50 ft. of the arrow's flight path, or become {@condition deafened} until the next round.": "具有敏锐感觉（听觉）的生物如果在箭的飞行路线的50英尺范围内，必须进行智慧救赎（DC12），否则会变成（%0%），直到下一轮。",
	"These axes are the trademark of the tunnel fighting dwarves within those clans that have such trained shocktroops. Essentially a hefty double-headed axe, the Axebow also contains a heavy crossbow, built into the haft and head of the axe. By necessity, the limbs on the crossbow are shorter than those on a full heavy crossbow, and thus the weapon is for most intents treated as a light crossbow. The design of the axebow does not allow for easy reloading in combat, and generally it is fired immediately at the beginning of an encounter and only reloaded when the battle is over. Reloading an axebow takes two actions": "这些斧头是那些拥有这种训练有素的冲击部队的部族内的隧道战斗矮人的标志。从本质上说，斧头是一把沉重的双头斧，它还包含一个重型弩箭，内置在斧头的柄部和头部。由于需要，弩上的肢体比完整的重弩上的肢体要短，因此该武器在大多数情况下被视为轻弩。斧头弓的设计不允许在战斗中轻易装弹，一般来说，它在遭遇战开始时立即发射，只有在战斗结束后才重新装弹。为斧头弓重新装弹需要两个动作"
