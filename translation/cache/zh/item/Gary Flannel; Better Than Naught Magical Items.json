	"{@bold Features} (GM): The armor itself is nothing so much as a lightweight scarf wrapped around one's midsection. It offers no protection from the elements or natural hazards and is extremely fragile. However, any and all attack rolls against the wearer are made at against an AC representative of the illusion the wearer desires (and he can reset once per day). The more unbelievable and rare the armor imagined, the lower the DC Wis save to disbelieve it is real. Once per scene, a creature may have a Wis save to disbelieve the armor upon first seeing it. On a success, there is no armor, only a pale pink and green scarf (ugly at that) wrapped around the wearer's midsection. On a failure, the armor is \"real\" to that person for the scene. Simple common light armor is a DC23, medium armor DC18, heavy armor DC13. Every resistance added to the armor (represented by appropriate visual effects on the illusory armor like a bluish glow for cold or skulls for necrotic) decreases the DC by 5. So, \"wearing\" slashing resistance heavy plate (plate with \"great rounded and smoothly polished guards to deflect blades\") is a Wis save DC 8 for all creatures the first time they see it and every scene thereafter. \"Taking off\" the armor or putting other armor on gives all the observers a new save immediately with advantage.": "{@bold Features} (GM): 盔甲本身不过是包裹在人的中间的一条轻质围巾。它不提供对元素或自然危害的保护，而且非常脆弱。然而，对穿戴者的任何和所有攻击卷都是以穿戴者所希望的幻觉的AC值为基础进行的（他每天可以重设一次）。想象中的盔甲越是不可思议，越是罕见，相信它是真实的DC Wis救赎就越低。每个场景有一次，一个生物在第一次看到盔甲时可以用Wis救赎来否定它。如果成功，就没有盔甲，只有一条淡粉色和绿色的围巾（很丑）缠在穿戴者的腹部。失败时，该盔甲在该场景中对该人是 \"真实的\"。简单的普通轻型盔甲是DC23，中型盔甲DC18，重型盔甲DC13。盔甲上每增加一个抗性（用虚幻的盔甲上适当的视觉效果来表示，比如寒冷的蓝光或坏死的头骨），都会使DC减少5。 因此，\"穿着 \"抗砍的重板（带有 \"巨大的圆形和光滑的抛光护板以抵御刀片 \"的板），在所有生物第一次看到它和此后的每个场景中，都要进行Wis save DC 8。\"脱掉 \"盔甲或穿上其他盔甲后，所有的观察者都会立即得到一个新的救赎，并具有优势。",
	"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): Paulo laughed and laughed and laughed, wading through the attacks. Arrows splintering to pieces off of his magnificent breastplate. He cackled as the soldiers charged him, spears at the ready and almost shat himself in glee as he saw the great loping bugbear roar in frustration at how deftly the matching magnificent shield deflected his resounding blows.": "{@bold Description}（玩家面对面）。保罗笑了又笑，笑了又笑，涉险过关。箭矢在他华丽的胸甲上劈啪作响。当士兵们冲向他的时候，他咯咯地笑了起来，长矛已经准备好了，当他看到那只巨大的奔跑的虫子在挫折中咆哮，而与之匹配的华丽的盾牌却巧妙地挡住了他铿锵有力的打击时，他几乎高兴得大叫起来。",
	"Paulo had waded into their camp an hour ago and was beside himself with joy imagining the accolades he would get from the King... and the presents... the gifts... oh, the women! His was a smug satisfaction at the invulnerable splendor encasing his body... right up until his squire, an old cutpurse Paulo had pressed into service from the capitol took a moment and squinted at him. The look on the old, toothless man's face went from curiosity to disbelief to annoyance to determination as he walked up close and put a knife through Paulo's heavy steel gorget, mail, leather, and throat. As he bled out on the ground, the old thief spit... \"lying twat\".": "保罗在一小时前进入了他们的营地，想象着他将从国王那里得到的赞誉......还有礼物......礼物......哦，女人！他对包裹着他的身体的无坚不摧的辉煌感到自得。他对自己身上那无坚不摧的华丽外表感到得意洋洋......直到他的侍从，一个保罗从首都征召来的老裁缝，花了点时间，眯着眼睛看着他。当他走到近前，用刀穿过保罗沉重的钢盔、邮件、皮革和喉咙时，这个没牙的老人脸上的表情从好奇到不相信再到恼怒再到决心。当他在地上流血的时候，这个老贼吐出了......。\"撒谎的娘们\"。",

	"{@bold Features} (GM): The Paerma is small oval shield, barely large enough for a halfling to hide behind were it not for his feet.  Close inspection shows that its leathery surface is (morbidly) made from perfectly cut herring-bone patches of skin—each as small as a coin.  The skins patches were trophies kept by The Haxian, a zealous cleric three-hundred years ago responsible for cleansing the Ophea of the monsterous undead.  Each patch was cut from the forehead of an undead creature slain by his wrath.": "{@bold Features} (GM): 帕尔玛是一面椭圆形的小盾牌，如果不是因为他的脚，几乎不足以让一个半身人躲在后面。 仔细观察可以发现，它的皮革表面是由完美切割的鲱鱼骨皮片制成的（病态的），每块皮片都像硬币一样小。 这些皮片是哈希安保存的战利品，他是三百年前的一位狂热的教士，负责清洗奥菲亚的怪物亡灵。 每个补丁都是从被他的愤怒杀死的不死生物的额头上割下来的。",

	"Attunement to the shield requires the killing of a necromancer, his last moments of life leaving his body while on the shield.  For this reason combined with the oddly unearthly materials of the shield, most of the faith's champions—even the most righteous and intense—find themselves unequal to bearing it.": "适应这面盾牌需要杀死一个死灵法师，在盾牌上时他最后的生命时刻离开了他的身体。 由于这个原因，再加上盾牌奇特的非尘世材料，大多数信仰的拥护者--即使是最正义和最强烈的人--都发现自己没有能力承受它。",
	"Once attuned however, the shield provides two boons to the bearer.   First, on any surprise round, if the wielder gets to take a turn, they may use their reaction to smack the rim of the shield against any hard surface to cause a flash of pure, radiant, divine light to arc out around them. This light has the effect of causing any undead creature to lose their turn in the surprise round.": "然而，一旦适应了这个盾牌，它就会为持有者提供两个好处。  首先，在任何一个惊奇的回合中，如果持盾者得到了一个回合，他们可以用他们的反应将盾牌的边缘拍打在任何坚硬的表面上，使他们周围出现一道纯粹的、有光芒的、神圣的光弧。这道光的效果是使任何不死生物在突击回合中失去他们的回合。",
	"Second, the wielder may take an action to use the shield to bash (as an improvised weapon doing +0 magical 1d4 + Strength bludgeoning; any features, feats, or other rules allowing for shield bash with proficiency bonus may apply if applicable).  This bash forces the Diseased condition on any undead creatures, even if they are Immune.": "其次，持剑者可以采取行动使用盾牌进行撞击（作为一种简易武器，造成+0魔法1d4+力量的重击；如果适用的话，任何允许盾牌撞击的特征、特技或其他规则都可以适用于熟练度奖励）。 这种撞击会对任何不死生物造成疾病状态，即使它们是免疫的。",

Broadways was cinching his last gauntlet, breathing even and slow while sounds—inhuman and uneven—spat and hissed and shuffled around him.": "月亮是新的，森林是黑暗的，如果有火，它将无力抵抗从树丛中溢出的流动的夜。Broadways正在收紧他的最后一件铠甲，呼吸均匀而缓慢，而人类的声音和不均匀的声音在他周围喷溅，嘶嘶作响，摇摇欲坠。",
	"There were... twenty. Maybe more. His old campaigner's ears knew their business, and the things in the dark were waiting. If they were autonomous, they'd either chatter or rush all together; if they were only minions of some central evil he'd be chiming in right about now...": "有......二十个。也许更多。他的老竞选者的耳朵知道他们的业务，而黑暗中的东西正在等待。如果它们是自主的，它们要么喋喋不休，要么一哄而上；如果它们只是某个中心恶魔的爪牙，他现在就会插嘴了......",
	"\"Huuuuuman... yooooooo naaaawt weeeelcomb... naaaawt heer...\" a voice from over his left drawled out–the Night's Tongue.  He'd heard it often enough that he could place it easily.  And as he picked up his small oval shield and tapped the rim on his chestplate, the flash of light bought him two things:": "\"Huuuuman......yooooooo naaaawt weeeelcomb......naaaawt heer...... \"一个声音从他的左上方抽出--夜之语。 他经常听到这个声音，所以他可以很容易地找到它。 当他拿起他的小椭圆盾牌并敲击胸前的边缘时，闪光使他得到了两样东西。",

	"{@bold Features} (GM): When the cultists of the Child God came to the windswept tundra of the Southlands, they were escaping persecution in the Old Empire and seeking a place to call forth the horror that is the center of their worship. The Child had never touched this world directly, though its servants had murdered nations in the past to bring that about. Had it not been for the sacrifice of every last living member of the Intuer Clan in fighting back the first few steps of the infant demigod into the world, there would be no living thing left today. But, Lanaria of the Wild—the Clan's matriarch—fought it back through the tear in reality and fashioned a ceremonial trophy cray from the hide of the arm that had clawed its way through.": "{@bold Features} (GM): 当儿童之神的崇拜者来到南地的风雪冻土时，他们是为了逃避旧帝国的迫害，并寻找一个地方来召唤作为他们崇拜中心的恐怖。圣婴从未直接接触过这个世界，尽管它的仆人过去曾为实现这一目标而谋杀了一些国家。如果不是英图尔氏族的每一个活着的成员在击退婴儿半神进入世界的最初几步时做出了牺牲，今天就不会有任何活物留下。但是，野性的拉娜丽亚--该族的族长--通过现实中的裂缝将其打回原形，并从抓破它的手臂的皮上制作了一个仪式性的战利品。",
	"The Cray of the Dead God is a length of grey and irregularly blackened hide as wide as a man's two fingers at the narrowest points and up to a foot wide at the broadest. It's roughly fifteen feet long, ragged-edged and coarse. Attunement requires a careful, ritualistic wrapping of the leather around one's body in a ceremonial observance of one's own possible and welcomed (if the spirits demand it) death; Religion check DC20 to get it right, DC 10 for Barbarians. Failure on this check means one cannot properly work the garment/armor for a number of weeks equal to one's level.": "死神的克雷是一段灰色和不规则发黑的皮，最窄处有一个人的两个手指那么宽，最宽处有一英尺宽。它大约有15英尺长，边缘破损且粗糙。驯服需要小心翼翼地将皮革包裹在自己的身体上，这是对自己可能的和受欢迎的（如果神灵要求的话）死亡的一种仪式性观察；宗教检查DC20才能正确，野蛮人的DC10。该检查的失败意味着一个人在相当于其等级的数周内无法正常使用该服装/盔甲。",
	"One attuned, the armor grants the wearer an inconsistent, but powerful defense against damage. Give the player 9 cards from a conventional deck (2 through 10, each number once), then from the remaining deck, the DM draws one card and places it face down on the table. The PC has an armor class of 10 + their Dex modifier (as though unarmored), and with a Reaction (can be done in response to being hit), the Player may play any card from their hand to increase the AC of the character by that amount. That AC is the standing AC for the character until they are successful hit (even if no damage is done), then it returns to 10 + Dex modifier. When the player uses a card, it is discarded and they cannot use it again.": "一经调整，盔甲会赋予穿戴者一种不稳定但强大的防御伤害能力。从常规牌组中给玩家9张牌（2到10，每个数字一次），然后从剩下的牌组中，DM抽出一张牌并将其正面朝下放在桌上。该PC的护甲等级为10+他们的Dex修正值（就像没有护甲一样），通过反应（可以在被击中后进行），玩家可以从他们的手中打出任何一张牌来增加该角色的AC值。该AC值是该角色的常设AC值，直到他们被成功击中（即使没有造成伤害），然后恢复到10+Dex修改器。当玩家使用了一张牌，它就会被丢弃，他们不能再使用它。",
	"At any point, the player may ask that the DM's card be used (this is done blind, they do not know the value). It also goes away on a successful hit. Only when all the player's cards have been used can they be re-dealt 2-10 again (and the DM redraws a single card, as at the start; discarding whatever they had, if they still have one).": "在任何时候，玩家都可以要求使用DM的牌（这是盲目的，他们不知道其价值）。它也会在成功击中后消失。只有当所有玩家的牌都被用完后，他们才能再次被重新抽出2-10张牌（DM重新抽出一张牌，就像开始时一样；如果他们还有一张牌，就丢掉他们的牌）。",

	"The lower encampment was, if anything, larger than the last one—and that had nearly killed them all. Soldiers, pink-faced and ready, were lined up to storm the earthy mound and give them all a death long in the coming.

The Father is that axe, the fabled arms of one of the orcish peoples' greatest heroes who held off the invasion of human and elf alike with his words and piety and the Father.": "{@bold Features} (GM): 父亲是一把兽人大斧头，和南部山区兽人的最后一位高级国王萨格-索拉克-加特的血统一样古老。他统治了近一个世纪，几代人，他的标准是灰色领域上的一把黑色大斧。父亲就是那把斧头，传说中兽人族最伟大的英雄之一的武器，他用他的话语和虔诚以及父亲挡住了人类和精灵的入侵。",
	"The Father of Tribes is a magical +0 greataxe, the blade as large and wide as a wagon wheel.

Interposing the axe head in this way grants a +2 cover bonus for that attack only, possibly causing the successful hit to miss (much as Shield, the spell, but less broad).": "一旦调整好，大斧头会使持斧人在魅力检查中获得优势，旨在激发和增强他人的信心和勇气，并允许持斧人使用他们的反应在5英尺内的盟友和针对他们的成功攻击（必须是针对他们的攻击卷成功击中）之间穿插斧头的刀刃（宽而厚）。以这种方式穿插斧头，仅对该次攻击给予+2的掩护奖励，可能会导致成功命中的攻击失败（与法术中的盾牌一样，但没有那么广泛）。",

In reaction to either an attack roll attempt or a successful hit, the wearer of the gloves may use their already in-hand weapon to block and grapple the strike. One must choose to use this ability when an attack is declared, if not one may choose to use this ability when an attack successfully hits; if one does not use the ability on the declared attack and the attack misses, one cannot go back and choose to use it. Using their Reaction, the wearer may block the strike with their weapon—the wearer and the opponent now locked in a fierce weapon-to-weapon clash. This grapple has the added condition of preventing either party from moving the other (all movement is 0 for both) as well as requiring both hands of each to maintain (thus, no attacks while locked together). At the start of each participant's turn, they may attempt to overpower the other by attempting an Acrobatics or Athletics versus the other one's Athletics (only). The larger weapon (determined by damage dice) is considered to be advantaged in this check. On a successful overpower, the opponent is either knocked prone or shoved back 5 ft. (winner's choice). On a natural 20 on the overpower roll, the winner may choose to do both. After combat, the survivors gain 1 exhaustion for every such overpower they succeed at. This exhaustion may be removed with 1 hit dice for each point, without the need for a short rest, and via normal rules and spells.": "{@bold Features} (GM): Ynx的手套曾经是剑圣中的常见物品。修饰需要在黎明时分用自己喜欢的武器进行晨祷，并放弃在标准武术武器列表中选择三种武器的熟练度。一旦被选中，就可以像其他角色一样通过停工或特技重新获得熟练度，但在那之前对这些武器没有任何熟练度--放弃了较差的金属而专注于真正的战争武器。从这里开始，手套赋予佩戴者与攻击中的武装敌人进行专门抓捕的能力。在对攻击卷的尝试或成功命中的反应中，手套的佩戴者可以使用他们已经在手的武器来阻挡和抓取攻击。必须在宣布攻击时选择使用这个能力，如果没有，可以在攻击成功击中时选择使用这个能力；如果在宣布攻击时没有使用这个能力，而攻击没有击中，就不能回头选择使用这个能力。使用他们的反应，穿戴者可以用他们的武器挡住攻击--穿戴者和对手现在被锁定在一个激烈的武器对武器的冲突中。这种擒拿的附加条件是阻止任何一方移动对方（双方的所有移动都是0），以及需要双方的双手来维持（因此，在锁定时没有攻击）。在每个参与者的回合开始时，他们可以通过尝试用杂技或田径对抗对方的田径（仅）来试图制服对方。较大的武器（由伤害骰子决定）在这个检查中被认为是有优势的。如果制服成功，对方要么被打倒在地，要么被推后5英尺（胜者选择）。如果制服卷的自然值为20，获胜者可以选择同时进行。战斗结束后，幸存者每成功完成一次这样的制服，就会获得一次疲惫。这种疲惫可以用每点1个命中率骰子来消除，不需要短暂的休息，并通过正常的规则和法术。",
	"Love is war. That's what Grek-voke believed and in this moment, close enough to see every bead of sweat on his opponent's brow—each weary line of the old Captain's weathered face. He really felt close, emotionally significant, to the man. They were locked in the most honest moment of their lives.": "爱就是战争。这就是格雷克-沃克所相信的，在这一刻，近到足以看到他的对手眉毛上的每一颗汗珠--老船长饱经风霜的脸上的每一条疲惫的线条。他真的感到与这个人很亲近，在感情上很重要。他们被锁定在他们生命中最诚实的时刻。",
	"Raef would likely try and ruin it, the child-like sneak would be circling around to the soldier's flank and it boiled a small spite in Grek. It would only spoil this. The ache in his arms as he held his nicked and scratched falchion in two large hands, his shoulder forward and bracing was sweet and dangerous. The Captain's own axe kissing his sword and the old man leaning into it just as deliciously.": "雷夫很可能会试图破坏它，这个像孩子一样的偷袭者会绕到士兵的侧翼，这让格雷克心中沸腾起一股小小的怨气。它只会破坏这一切。当他用两只大手握住被划伤的法杖，肩膀向前撑起时，手臂上的疼痛是甜蜜而危险的。上尉自己的斧头亲吻着他的剑，而那个老人也同样美味地靠在上面。",
	"They were entwined in their rage and gamble. It was an honest moment. This was skill and vigor at work. This was true combat.

Not giving and inch, risking evisceration... this was love. And he wanted to savor it for as long as he could.": "他们在愤怒和赌博中纠缠在一起。这是一个诚实的时刻。这是技巧和活力在起作用。这是真正的战斗。咒语和魔法以及黑暗中的偷袭箭都是不道德的，也是廉价的......但这一刻，与一个真正的战士来回咆哮？寸步不让，冒着死亡的危险......这就是爱。他想尽可能长时间地品味它。",

The angel died and the decomposing worm-like creatures that gnawed their way out of its body were collected by some of his most loyal and kept in a glass jar, scribed in madness-inducing runes. The jar itself demands a DC15 CHA save every time one looks at it or touches it (within the same scene). Failure demands a roll for madness. If the person is a Warlock, it is short-term (from the short-term madness table). If they are an arcane caster (of any kind), it is from the medium-term table. All others, it is long-term. There are two handfuls of \"worms\" in the jar. Ingesting a handful of worms removes curses, poison, disease, fright, and the effects of being charmed. The ingestor makes a DC 20 Con save or spend the next round vomiting bad blood and pus, yielding 1 exhaustion afterward. The jar never permanently runs out. It replenishes 1 handful every 24 hours to a maximum of 2.": "{@bold Features} (GM): Ebliss，光明山脉的伟大老者（天空的黑暗之心，桥梁之主）在一个太阳能的心脏中孵化了他垂死的荣耀的卷轴。天使死后，那些从它身体里啃出来的腐烂的蠕虫状生物被他最忠诚的一些人收集起来，保存在一个玻璃罐子里，上面刻有诱发疯狂的符文。每当人们看着它或触摸它时（在同一场景内），玻璃罐子本身需要一个DC15的CHA救赎。如果失败，则需要进行一次疯狂测试。如果这个人是术士，则是短期的（来自短期疯狂表）。如果他们是奥术施法者（任何一种），则是中期表。所有其他人则是长期的。罐子里有两把 \"虫子\"。摄取一把虫子可以消除诅咒、毒药、疾病、惊吓和被魅惑的影响。摄取者需要做一个DC20的自救，否则下一回合就会吐出恶血和脓液，之后会产生1次疲惫。罐子里的东西永远不会用完。它每24小时补充1把，最多补充2把。",

	"All, however, lost to time. And what's left is one small, brass bladed knife. Attunement ot the knife requires the slow death of an enemy by using it. The knife counts as a +0 magic weapon (given its short blade and small handle, it's not particularly wieldy and counts as an improvised weapon dealing 1 piercing damage). A successful strike with the knife and one pokes a small hole shallowly into the target. Undead, constructs, and largely immaterial or ethereal creatures are unaffected. But, if it lives and it bleeds, the Bleeder reduces their HP maximum by 1 (in addition to the damage dealt). Every five successful hits imposes 1 exhaustion on the target that need be healed magically (any restoration at all will remove these exhaustion points).": "然而，所有这些都消失在时间中。剩下的是一把铜制的小刀。适应这把刀需要通过使用它来缓慢地杀死一个敌人。这把刀算作一个+0的魔法武器（鉴于它的短刀和小刀柄，它不是特别好用，算作一个简易的武器，造成1的穿刺伤害）。用这把刀成功地攻击，就能在目标身上浅浅地戳出一个小洞。亡灵、构筑物和大部分非物质或虚无的生物不受影响。但是，如果它活着并且流血，放血者会将其最大HP减少1（除了造成的伤害之外）。每成功击中5次，就会给目标施加1个需要用魔法治疗的疲惫值（任何恢复都会消除这些疲惫值）。",
