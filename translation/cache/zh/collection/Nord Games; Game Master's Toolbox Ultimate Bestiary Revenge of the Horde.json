	"Bugbears' individualistic spirit makes them well suited for adventuring life, provided they do not allow themselves to be ruled too fully by their superstitious nature.

	"Around the same height as a man, but typically broader, bugbears are covered in a pelt of shaggy hair ranging from black to reddishblonde, save for the palms of their hands, flats of their feet, and the very fronts of their square, brutish faces. In some Northern tribes, this hair is replaced in winter with a white coat. Their hands and feet are covered in a soft pad, making their tread almost silent. Males and females are nearly identical, and what few differences they do have are hidden to others under their hair.": "虫熊的身高和人差不多，但通常比较宽大，除了手掌、脚掌和方形、粗野的脸的正面外，都覆盖着从黑色到红金色的蓬松毛发。在一些北方部落，这种头发在冬季被白色的外套所取代。他们的手和脚都覆盖着柔软的垫子，使他们的脚步几乎无声。雄性和雌性几乎完全相同，他们的少数差异都隐藏在头发下。",
	"Bugbears are primarily carnivorous, but can scrape by on vegetable matter in lean times.

	"Clothing and armor is simple; their layer of fur means they have little need for clothing to keep warm, and when a bugbear meets an enemy in battle it is usually convinced it will triumph regardless of the odds, so armor is of limited importance. One adornment they will not hold back on is the variety of trinkets, talismans, and amulets they will weave into their hair for additional protection and good luck. Warriors may also sport a severed head or two hanging from their belt on their way back from battle.": "衣服和盔甲很简单；他们的皮毛层意味着他们几乎不需要衣服来保暖，而且当一只虫熊在战斗中遇到敌人时，它通常相信自己会不顾一切地取得胜利，所以盔甲的重要性有限。有一种装饰品他们不会保留，那就是各种饰品、护身符和护身符，他们会把这些东西编织在头发上，以获得额外的保护和好运气。战士们在从战场回来的路上也可能会在腰带上挂上一两颗断头。",
	"As the largest of the goblin races, bugbears dominate their smaller kin individually, though hobgoblin discipline and goblin numbers can turn the odds against them. Lone bugbears sometimes take control of a goblin troop, a task made easy by their cunning and brute strength. They do not fare so well against hobgoblins, who pose a more even match and bugbears view them with a grudging respect. On occasions when the two races do work together, most commonly with the bugbears working as a mercenary scouting force under the hobgoblins, the bugbears often resent the hobgoblins' superior attitude and seek to undermine their authority. In extreme cases, they will break their alliance with a few assassinations and disappear into the night.": "作为地精种族中最大的种族，虫族单独支配着他们较小的亲属，尽管霍布林的纪律和地精的数量可以扭转对他们的不利局面。孤独的虫族有时会控制一支地精部队，他们的狡猾和蛮力使这项任务变得容易。他们在对阵妖精时就不那么顺利了，妖精构成了一个更均衡的对手，而虫族则对他们怀有一种不情愿的尊敬。在两个种族合作的场合，最常见的是虫族作为雇佣兵的侦察部队在霍布林手下工作，虫族经常对霍布林的优越态度感到不满，并试图破坏他们的权威。在极端的情况下，他们会用一些暗杀行动来破坏他们的联盟，然后消失在黑夜中。",
	"As well as their predisposition for ambushes and raids rather than battle, bugbears' reliance on signs makes it rare for them to actually make war or engage in any sustained conflict; an ill-omened flight of birds or prophetic dream could easily put a halt on a military campaign. Despite this, those removed from traditional bugbear culture are commonly found as mercenaries in the civilized world, and often ply their trade as assassins.": "由于他们倾向于埋伏和突袭而不是战斗，虫族对征兆的依赖使得他们很少真正开战或参与任何持续的冲突；一个不吉利的鸟类飞行或预言性的梦境可以轻易地让军事行动停止。尽管如此，那些脱离了传统虫族文化的人在文明世界中通常被发现为雇佣兵，并经常作为刺客进行交易。",
	"Bugbears are ruled by ritual and superstition. They see auguries in all things, and will refuse action unless the signs are right.": "虫族被仪式和迷信所支配。他们在所有事情中都能看到预兆，除非征兆正确，否则会拒绝采取行动。",
	"When a bugbear is born, they are ascribed a totem animal by the tribe's elders, perhaps an eagle was seen flying over the birthing tent, or the hunt had just returned with a boar.The individual aspires to the attributes of their totem - the strength of the bear, the swiftness of the deer, the ferocity of the badger - and is forbidden from killing the creature. The one notable exception to this is when a bugbear dedicates their life to a cause, such as vengeance, retribution, or war. Here, they will make a declaration of their intent, and a sacrifice of their totem animal, symbolizing their death and rebirth as an instrument of the cause. One creature revered by all is the owl, as the embodiment of the silent hunter. Any who kill an owl may, indeed must, be killed without repercussion.": "当一个虫熊出生时，他们被部落的长老赋予了一种图腾动物，也许是看到一只鹰在分娩的帐篷上空飞翔，或者是猎人们刚刚带着一头野猪回来。个人渴望得到他们图腾的属性--熊的力量、鹿的敏捷、獾的凶猛--并且被禁止杀害这种生物。唯一值得注意的例外是，当一只虫熊将自己的生命奉献给某项事业时，如复仇、报应或战争。在这种情况下，他们会宣布自己的意图，并以自己的图腾动物为祭品，象征着他们作为事业的工具而死亡和重生。有一种生物受到所有人的敬重，那就是猫头鹰，它是沉默的猎人的化身。任何杀死猫头鹰的人都可以，事实上也必须被杀死而不会受到影响。",
	"A bugbear will carve small amulets of stone or wood representing its totem, along with other animals and more abstract designs. These it will weave into its longer strands of hair, along with mementos of significant hunts and trophies from worthy foes. It is believed that these will curry favor with whatever spirits determine fate and will protect them from harm and misfortune. Taking another's totem is a grave insult, made worse if the thief goes on to wear it openly, but being given another's is the sign of a lifelong, unbreakable bond and often goes hand in hand with swearing oaths in blood.": "一只虫熊会用石头或木头雕刻出代表其图腾的小护身符，以及其他动物和更抽象的设计。它将这些东西编织到它的长发中，还有重要的狩猎纪念品和有价值的敌人的战利品。人们相信，这些东西会讨好决定命运的任何神灵，并会保护他们免受伤害和不幸。夺取他人的图腾是一种严重的侮辱，如果盗贼继续公开佩戴它，情况就会变得更糟，但获得他人的图腾则是一种终生的、牢不可破的纽带的标志，而且往往与用鲜血起誓相伴而行。",
	"Bugbears also place great importance on collecting the heads of enemies they have slain. Some believe that the spirits of the dead remain in the heads, and will become the bugbear's slaves in the afterlife, others simply enjoy the respect and fear their collections inspire. Regardless of the intent, the sight of a bugbear warrior's hut with dozens of smoke-dried heads (each of which he will proudly tell you the story behind) nailed to the walls is enough to make an impression. Bugbears will engage in night raids against rival tribes and other monstrous races to add to their collections, and gain extra esteem if they can sneak in and return with a head without raising an alarm.": "虫人也非常重视收集他们所杀的敌人的头颅。有些人认为，死者的灵魂留在头颅中，并将在来世成为虫熊的奴隶，有些人只是喜欢他们的收藏品所激发的尊重和恐惧。不管是什么意图，看到一个虫族战士的小屋，墙上钉着几十个被烟熏干的头颅（每一个他都会自豪地告诉你背后的故事），就足以让人印象深刻。虫熊会参与对敌对部落和其他畸形种族的夜袭，以增加他们的收藏，如果他们能在不引起警报的情况下潜入并带着头颅回来，就会获得额外的尊重。",
	"Bugbears are most at home in forested areas or rocky grasslands, places they can easily find cover to aid a stealthy approach.": "虫熊最喜欢呆在森林地区或多石的草地上，这些地方他们很容易找到掩体来帮助他们隐秘地接近。",
	"Fairly advanced by the standards of monstrous races, bugbears construct simple dwellings from wood or stones and mud, covering the exteriors with natural materials so an unobservant traveler might mistake them for a feature of the landscape. Bugbears, as a rule uncomfortable in the gaze of others, prefer the option of privacy these dwellings give them, but won't snub the option of bedding down in a cave if needs be.": "以畸形种族的标准来看，虫族是相当先进的，他们用木头或石头和泥巴建造简单的住所，用天然材料覆盖外部，所以不留神的旅行者可能会误以为他们是风景的一部分。虫族通常不喜欢别人的注视，他们更喜欢这些住所给他们带来的隐私，但如果需要的话，他们也不会拒绝在山洞里睡觉的选择。",
	"With natural stealth and cunning, bugbears are able to make a living as parasites on other, more advanced races. Sometimes,the tribe lives within a settlement itself, secreting themselves in catacombs, cellars, and back alleys. Smaller settlements, where it would be more difficult for the bugbears to pass unnoticed, might have a hidden tribe of the creatures at the town limits without their knowing. While some tribes adapt to a more ‘civilized' way of life, keeping their thefts to food and supplies, others, particularly those inhabiting the so-called ‘shadow towns' on the outskirts, keep to their old, savage ways. It is not uncommon for these tribes to treat a settlement as nothing more than another forest, and the people within as game. Their habit of stealing folk away in the dead of night for food, sacrifice, or slavery has given them a dark, almost mythical, reputation.": "凭借天生的隐蔽性和狡猾，虫族能够以寄生在其他更先进的种族身上为生。有时，这个部落本身就生活在一个定居点内，把自己藏在地下墓穴、地窖和后巷里。较小的定居点，虫族更难在不被注意的情况下通过，可能会有一个隐藏的生物部落在城镇的边界，而他们并不知道。虽然有些部落适应了更 \"文明 \"的生活方式，将他们的偷窃行为保持在食物和用品上，但其他部落，特别是那些居住在郊区的所谓 \"影子镇 \"的部落，保持着他们古老、野蛮的方式。这些部落把一个定居点当作另一个森林，把里面的人当作游戏，这并不罕见。他们习惯于在夜深人静的时候把人偷走，作为食物、祭品或奴隶，这给了他们一个黑暗的、几乎是神话般的声誉。",
	"Bugbears often play the role of the dumb, hulking brute, but they usually take in far more than they let on; there is a shrewd cunning to their interactions with other races that can take the unwary by surprise, and they enjoy the power that fooling others in this way gives them. Where such subterfuge is not an option, such as when dealing with those well-versed in bugbear ways, their simple physical power is enough to keep them feeling superior, though in a less satisfying manner.": "虫族经常扮演着笨重的畜生的角色，但他们通常接受的东西远远多于他们所说的；他们与其他种族的互动有一种精明的狡猾，可以让不小心的人措手不及，而且他们享受以这种方式愚弄他人的力量。在没有这种潜规则的情况下，比如在与那些精通虫族方式的人打交道时，他们简单的身体力量就足以让他们保持优越感，尽管是以一种不太令人满意的方式。",
	"They like to keep to their own company and enjoy peace and quiet. It is rare to see them sharing a joke or a song outside of rare feast or festival days (and most will take a few days of grumpy silence afterwards to recover). Bugbears instinctively and fiercely dislike individual attention; to make eye contact while talking is considered rude at best, and a direct, aggressive challenge at worst.": "他们喜欢保持自己的公司，享受和平和安静。在罕见的盛宴或节日之外，很少看到他们分享笑话或歌曲（而且大多数人事后会花上几天的时间来恢复暴躁的沉默）。虫熊本能地不喜欢别人的关注；说话时进行眼神交流，充其量被认为是无礼的，最糟糕的是被认为是一种直接的、有攻击性的挑战。",
	"The bugbear dialect of Goblin is a softer one, with less clipped vowels and harsh consonants. It is viewed by other Goblin speakers as lazy and languid, and it is common for other goblinoids to use its words and phrases to denote a stupid individual, though they would never do so in the presence of a bugbear.": "哥布林的虫子方言是一种比较柔和的方言，元音不那么尖锐，辅音很刺耳。它被其他讲哥布林语的人视为懒惰和无精打采，其他哥布林人使用它的单词和短语来表示一个愚蠢的人是很常见的，尽管他们在虫族面前绝不会这样做。",
	"Bugbear names favor long, rolling vowels, easy to whisper, but equally easy to draw out into secretive cries resembling the calls of animals, allowing them to communicate over great distances without alerting nearby prey.": "虫熊的名字偏向于长的、滚动的元音，易于耳语，但同样易于引出类似于动物叫声的隐秘叫声，使它们能够在很远的距离上进行交流而不惊动附近的猎物。",
	"{@i Bugbear Names:} Aakaar, Bruukzag, Eefka, Hruduun, Hugut, Kaskaar, Kuuzga, Razag, Ruuzug, Taakra, Tuuzgo, Uukar, Yaarka": "{@i Bugbear Names:} Aakaar, Bruukzag, Eefka, Hruduun, Hugut, Kaskaar, Kuuzga, Razag, Ruuzug, Taakra, Tuuzgo, Uukar, Yaarka",
	"Bugbears have no fear of open combat, but see it as senseless if there is opportunity to take their enemy by surprise, making full use of their natural stealth to attack from ambush whenever they can. If possible, they will return to cover after their initial attack, drawing out combat into a series of hit-and-run strikes. If forced into prolonged combat, bugbears fight individually with an animal fury, trusting fate to keep them safe": "虫族并不惧怕公开的战斗，但如果有机会出其不意，他们会认为这是毫无意义的，只要有机会，他们就会充分利用自己天生的隐蔽性，从埋伏处发动攻击。如果可能的话，他们会在最初的攻击后返回掩体，将战斗引向一系列的打了就跑的攻击。如果被迫进入长时间的战斗，虫族会以一种动物的愤怒单独作战，相信命运会让他们安全。",
	"Their sense of camaraderie is somewhat lacking and, if their losses begin to mount up, it is every bugbear for itself. Their tendency to scatter to the four winds when defeated in battle means it is relatively easy to halt bugbear attacks for a short while as they regroup, but also makes it very difficult to permanently stop them; a group of bugbears is hard enough to find when they stick together, let alone when they separate.": "他们的友爱意识有些缺乏，如果他们的损失开始增加，那就是每个虫子自己的事了。当他们在战斗中被击败时，他们倾向于分散到四面八方，这意味着在他们重新组合时，相对容易阻止虫族的攻击，但也使得永久地阻止他们非常困难；一群虫族粘在一起时已经很难找到，更不用说他们分开时。",
	"Most bugbears prize troll meat highly, eating it whenever they have the opportunity in ceremonies which can last days or weeks. Along with the practical benefits of tough hide and plentiful meat, their flesh is thought to contain the very essence of their regenerative power, which can be transferred to those who eat it, and fortunes told from their organs can be repeated if the organs are allowed to regrow, giving such readings additional weight. However, with the risks involved in taking down a troll, even for experienced hunters, few actively seek them out as quarry on a regular basis. The Helweer (‘Hunters') are something of an exception, and their home range–a vast forest with plentiful wetlands, bordered by snowcapped mountains and rocky hills–attracts a good population of a variety of trolls.": "大多数虫人都非常珍视巨魔的肉，只要有机会，他们就会在可能持续数天或数周的仪式上吃掉它。除了坚韧的皮和丰富的肉的实际好处外，他们的肉被认为包含了他们再生能力的精髓，这可以转移到那些吃它的人身上，如果允许器官再生，从他们的器官上算出的财富可以重复，使这种读数具有额外的重量。然而，即使对有经验的猎人来说，打倒巨魔也有一定的风险，很少有人会主动把它们当做猎物定期寻找。海尔韦尔（\"猎人\"）是个例外，他们的家乡--一个有着丰富湿地的广阔森林，周围是白雪皑皑的山脉和岩石山丘--吸引着各种巨魔的良好群体。",
	"The secret to their success is a paste created from a rare acidic mineral known as hengelin (‘trollsbane') the only known location of which is a deposit in the center of their camp, mixed in the cured stomach of a gnoll (whose gastric juices enable them to digest bone). This alone is powerful enough to overcome troll's regeneration. Their frequent raiding on neighboring gnoll clans has earned them great enmity but so far, no gnoll has dared enter their forest for retribution, and they are loath to move away due to the many well-trafficked roads crisscrossing the hills that provide their own prey.": "他们成功的秘诀是用一种被称为hengelin（\"巨魔丸\"）的罕见的酸性矿物制成的糊状物，其唯一已知的位置是在他们营地中心的一个矿床，混合在一个地精（其胃液使他们能够消化骨头）的固化胃里。仅此一项就足以克服巨魔的再生能力。他们对邻近的地精氏族的频繁袭击为他们赢得了极大的敌意，但到目前为止，还没有地精敢于进入他们的森林进行报复，而且由于许多交通便利的道路纵横交错的山丘为他们提供了自己的猎物，他们不愿搬走。",
	"Where possible, trolls are weakened and brought back to the tribe alive, where they can provide a source of constantly replenishing fresh meat for several weeks before their regeneration gives out and another hunting expedition needs to be organized. The Helweer keep good relations with other bugbear tribes of the forest by providing them with trolls for feast days, as well as using them to barter for favorable pairings between youngsters.": "在可能的情况下，巨魔会被削弱，并被活着带回部落，在那里它们可以在再生能力耗尽和需要组织另一次狩猎远征之前的几个星期内提供不断补充的鲜肉来源。海尔韦尔人与森林中的其他虫族部落保持着良好的关系，在宴会上向他们提供巨魔，并利用它们来换取年轻人之间有利的配对关系。",
	"Their headman, Klaad, was the first to discover the properties of hengelin and remains the leader of the most successful hunts. His graying hair betrays his age, and it remains to be seen whether he shall join the elders of the tribe or whether the next troll will overcome his slowly fading strength.": "他们的首领克拉德是第一个发现亨格林特性的人，并且仍然是最成功的狩猎活动的领导者。他的白发暴露了他的年龄，他是否会加入部落长老的行列，或者下一个巨魔是否会战胜他慢慢消退的力量，还有待观察。",
	"Some bugbear tribes worship the goblin pantheon of gods, with their mysticism being their means of devotion. Others directly worship their totem animals, or more general aspects of nature,and some cults venerate darker forces. Shunned by most other bugbears, even if they are seen as a necessary evil to keep these forces occupied elsewhere, these cults often form small tribes of their own, like the Khuunkleff (‘Nightmare') fear-worshipers.": "一些虫族部落崇拜妖精万神殿，他们的神秘主义是他们的奉献方式。其他人则直接崇拜他们的图腾动物，或更普遍的自然方面，还有一些邪教崇尚黑暗的力量。这些邪教被大多数其他虫族所回避，即使他们被视为使这些力量在其他地方占据的必要之恶，这些邪教往往形成自己的小部落，如Khuunkleff（\"噩梦\"）恐惧崇拜者。",
	"This small group of mostly-blood-related transitory bugbears are part of an ancient tradition, the mere mention of which is frowned upon by most tribes. They are unquestionably masters of stealth, even amongst their kind, but rumors abound of more eldritch powers. They carry strange totems; many-limbed monstrosities out of half-remembered nightmares which, it is said, grant some of them the power to slip inside the minds of sleepers, or even bring death upon those in their own dreams.": "这一小群大部分与血缘有关的临时性虫族是一个古老传统的一部分，仅仅是提到它就会被大多数部落所反对。他们无疑是隐身术的大师，即使在他们的同类中也是如此，但关于更多长生不老的力量的传言比比皆是。他们带着奇怪的图腾；有许多肢体的怪兽来自于半生不熟的噩梦，据说它们中的一些人有能力溜进睡眠者的头脑，甚至在自己的梦中给他们带来死亡。",
	"When traveling through bugbear and other goblinoid controlled lands, the Khuunkleff act as a reminder that none of their kind should think themselves above fear, for it is fear which keeps goblins safe. With a short spell of terror, they are reminded that there is always something more powerful than themselves, and they must be ever vigilant. The bugbears may not ever be seen by those they visit, but enough campfire stories exist that every goblin knows what a period of vivid nightmares, mysterious visitations and unexplainable deaths means.": "在穿越虫族和其他地精控制的土地时，昆克雷夫会提醒他们的同类不应该认为自己高于恐惧，因为正是恐惧使地精保持安全。通过短暂的恐怖咒语，他们被提醒，总有一些东西比他们自己更强大，他们必须时刻保持警惕。虫熊可能永远不会被它们拜访的人看到，但有足够多的篝火故事存在，每个妖精都知道一段生动的噩梦、神秘的拜访和无法解释的死亡意味着什么。",
	"If their travels take them close to civilized lands, a few of the Khuunkleff sell their services as assassins. While this is frowned upon by the tribe's elders as a cheapening of their traditions, it is not expressly forbidden, given that they are still spreading fear in their own way. They excel at eliminating political rivals where an outright assassination would be obvious and fingers would be pointed; the Khuunkleff utilize more subtle methods, infiltrating houses, waking sleepers with eerie noises, displaying bloodstained mementoes of family members which are found clean and in their proper place if another investigates, convincing the dwellers of hauntings or madness. If this continues for a period of time, the victim's potency as a rival is removed; they are either too worn down to maintain any political support, descend into madness,or are even driven to suicide. The bugbears are rewarded, and the power of fear is demonstrated.": "如果他们的旅行接近文明的土地，少数昆克雷夫人就会出售他们作为刺客的服务。虽然这被部落的长老们认为是对其传统的贬低，但鉴于他们仍在以自己的方式散布恐惧，所以并没有明确禁止。他们擅长消灭政治对手，因为直接暗杀会很明显，而且会有人指指点点；昆克雷夫人利用更微妙的方法，潜入房屋，用阴森的声音唤醒睡觉的人，展示沾有血迹的家庭成员的纪念品，如果有人调查，就会发现这些纪念品是干净的，放在适当的地方，让居住者相信有鬼或疯了。如果这种情况持续一段时间，受害者作为对手的效力就会被消除；他们要么被折磨得无法维持任何政治支持，要么陷入疯狂，甚至被逼自杀。虫子们得到了回报，恐惧的力量得到了体现。",
	"Members of the tribe are awarded titles, so named for their particular specialities. Kuurdwur (‘Dreamwalker') is unrivalled in convincing unwary sleepers that they are being watched and followed, Sibwuurd (‘The Whisperer') is a master of mimicry, tormenting victims with voices and sounds deeply buried or considered long-forgotten, and Oonfuus (‘Unease') sows seeds of disquiet, breaking trust, suggesting untruths and forcing misremembrances that leave those who thought themselves safe in their beds wondering who they can trust upon waking.": "该部落的成员被授予头衔，因其特殊专长而得名。Kuurdwur（\"梦游者\"）在说服不知情的睡眠者他们被监视和跟踪方面是无与伦比的；Sibwuurd（\"耳语者\"）是一个模仿大师，用深埋在地下或被认为早已遗忘的声音折磨受害者；Oonfuus（\"不安\"）播下不安的种子，打破信任，暗示不实之词，强迫记忆错误，让那些认为自己在床上很安全的人在醒来后怀疑他们可以信任谁。",
	"Years of warring with a well-supplied, well-trained, and ruthless foe can really only go one way for a tribe of bugbears. Typically few in number, individualistic, and scornful of asking for aid from others, the bugbears will normally be forced into hiding or fleeing. In the Kruudruun (‘Rootless')' case, the choice was made for them when a local noble, weary after years of bugbear raids on his town and skirmishes on his roads, ordered the forest burned to the ground.Those who fought the invaders were killed in battle or forced back into the flames, but the lord gave the elders and the young a chance to make their escape. In the following days, the survivors hunted,trapped, and sacrificed their totems, vowing revenge.": "与一个装备精良、训练有素、冷酷无情的敌人进行多年的战争，对一个虫族部落来说，真的只有一种结果。通常情况下，虫族的数量很少，有个性，而且不屑于向他人寻求援助，通常会被迫躲藏或逃离。在Kruudruun（\"无根\"）的情况下，他们的选择是在一个当地的贵族，在多年的虫子袭击他的城镇和在他的道路上的小规模冲突后感到疲惫，下令将森林烧成平地。那些与入侵者作战的人在战斗中被杀或被迫回到火焰中，但领主给长者和年轻人一个逃跑的机会。在接下来的日子里，幸存者猎杀、诱捕，并牺牲了他们的图腾，发誓要报仇。",
	"With none among them of fighting age, the diminished tribe wandered through plain and mountain, habitats unfamiliar to their kind. Tiluan, second to the tribe's previous elder and already respected by his broken brethren, took up the position of leadership, guiding his foundlings and kin through the seasons.When they could, they took shelter in forests, even joining other bugbear tribes for a time, but always wary of testing the bounds of another tribe's terse hospitality. Occasionally, young and hotheaded bugbears would journey on with them after such a stop,and so their numbers began to regrow. The youngsters grew into warriors, honing their skills on any traveler unfortunate enough to cross their path. The most notable of these has become the defacto war chief of the original youth, named Keentaaf (‘First Blood', in the common tongue) who slaked his blade with the blood of an entire merchant caravan the day he came of age.": "由于他们中没有人达到战斗年龄，这个衰弱的部落在平原和山区流浪，这些地方对他们来说是陌生的。Tiluan，仅次于部落以前的长老，已经被他破碎的兄弟们所尊重，担任了领导的职位，指导他的孩子和亲属度过四季。当他们可以时，他们在森林中避难，甚至有一段时间加入其他的虫熊部落，但总是小心翼翼地测试另一个部落的简明的招待的界限。偶尔，年轻的、头脑发热的虫族会在这种停留后与他们一起旅行，于是他们的数量开始重新增长。这些年轻人成长为战士，在任何不幸与他们擦肩而过的旅行者身上磨练他们的技能。其中最值得注意的是，他已经成为最初的青年的实际战争首领，名为Keentaaf（\"第一滴血\"，用普通话说），在他成年的那天，他用整个商队的血浸泡了他的刀。",
	"Now, their numbers regrown, their warriors blooded, the Kruudruun march for home, burning farmsteads and raiding villages in their path, melting away before reinforcements arrive.No bugbear tribe has marched for war in living memory, yet the Kruudruun seem to have developed a taste and a talent for sustained open combat beyond their usual guerilla ambushes, and their size, strength, and determination certainly gives them an advantage over the small garrisons guarding these minor settlements.": "现在，他们的人数重新增加，他们的战士浴血奋战，Kruudruun向家园进发，烧毁农庄，袭击沿途的村庄，在援军到来之前融化。在人们的记忆中，没有一个虫族部落为战争而行军，然而Kruudruun似乎已经发展出一种味道和天赋，除了他们通常的游击伏击，他们的规模、力量和决心无疑使他们比守卫这些小定居点的小型守卫部队更具优势。",
	"Bugbears age slightly more rapidly than humans and reach adulthood by the age of 12. They can live to the age of 70.": "虫族的衰老速度比人类稍快，在12岁时达到成年。他们可以活到70岁。",
	"A sense of calm self-sufficiency lends bugbears towards neither law or chaos. It is rare for one to care enough about the welfare of others to be considered good.": "平静的自给自足感使虫族既不喜欢法律也不喜欢混乱。一个人对他人的福利关心到足以被认为是好的，这很罕见。",
	"Bugbears average around six-and-a-half to seven feet tall, and are bulkier than humans, weighing just over 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "虫熊平均身高约为六英尺半到七英尺，比人类更笨重，体重刚刚超过200磅。你的体型是中等。",
	"Accustomed to the shadows of dark forests, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "习惯于黑暗森林的阴影，你在黑暗和昏暗的条件下有卓越的视觉。你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线中看到，就像亮光一样，而在黑暗中就像暗光一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Once per turn, you can add your proficiency bonus to a damage roll with a melee weapon you are proficient with.": "每回合一次，你可以用你精通的近战武器在伤害卷上加上你的熟练度加成。",
	"You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill, and in your choice of the Medicine, Nature, or Religion skills.": "你获得对隐身技能的熟练度，以及你选择的医学、自然或宗教技能。",
	"You can throw your voice, making any vocal sound you can ordinarily produce appear to emanate from a space of your choosing within 30 feet.": "你可以抛出你的声音，使你平时能发出的任何声音看起来是从30英尺内你选择的空间发出的。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Goblin and one other language of your choice. The bugbear dialect of goblin is softer, emphasizing and drawing out the vowel sounds.": "你可以说、读、写哥布林语和你选择的一种其他语言。哥布林语的虫族方言比较柔和，强调并引出元音的发音。",
	"With their strong ties to the clan, gnolls are most likely to take to adventuring having been raised from a pup by a mercenary or someone of a similar life. Gnolls raised by a clan may find themselves alone if the clan is wiped out, or if they are banished for a betrayal, and might be forced to interact more peaceably with other races to keep their belly full. ": "由于与氏族的关系密切，地精最有可能从幼崽开始就由雇佣兵或类似生活的人抚养，从而走上冒险之路。如果氏族被消灭，或因背叛而被放逐，由氏族养大的地精可能会发现自己很孤独，可能会被迫与其他种族进行更和平的互动，以保持他们的肚子饱满。",
	"Gnolls retain a strong instinct to physically dominate others, even those they are allied with, to work out a hierarchy. Despite this, they are fiercely aggressive of their established ‘clan', even non-gnolls, and see an insult or an attack on any ‘clan mate' as a personal one. They tend to be impulsive, with a strong predatory drive which may lead to them to engage or pursue an enemy even when it may not be the best tactical choice. Most gnolls continue to collect trophies from their kills, although they tend to avoid body parts while in more civilized company if it is against the will of their ‘clan mates'": "地精保留了一种强烈的本能，要在身体上支配他人，甚至是那些与他们结盟的人，以形成一种等级制度。尽管如此，他们对自己建立的 \"氏族\"，甚至非地精都有强烈的攻击性，并将对任何 \"氏族伙伴 \"的侮辱或攻击视为个人行为。他们往往很冲动，有强烈的掠夺欲，这可能导致他们与敌人交战或追击敌人，即使这可能不是最好的战术选择。大多数地精继续收集他们杀死的战利品，尽管他们倾向于在更文明的公司中避免身体部位，如果这违背了他们 \"族友 \"的意愿。",
	"Every community that lacks walls to hide behind fears it; the cackling and whooping in the night which denotes a roving clan of gnolls. Settlements that have fallen to gnolls are easy to identify; they leave no bodies as evidence of their attack, even clumps of grass where blood has been spilled will be ripped up and devoured. ": "每一个缺乏围墙的社区都害怕它；夜里的咯咯声和吼叫声代表着游荡的地精氏族。落入地精手中的定居点很容易辨认；它们不会留下任何尸体作为攻击的证据，甚至连洒过血的草丛也会被撕碎吞噬。",
	"Gnolls craft nothing of their own; they subsist entirely on what they can take from others, and scavenging is the central pillar of gnoll culture. Gnolls have no currency, and don't place an inherent value on items beyond ownership; a tin cup a gnoll stole or took by force will have far more value to it than a whole chest of gold found by the wayside. Gnolls will typically keep a collection of items taken from their victims, sometimes coins or something similarly ubiquitous, but far more often body parts, with ears, hands, and scalps being the most common trophies. ": "地精没有自己的手艺；他们完全靠从别人那里得到的东西生存，拾荒是地精文化的核心支柱。地精没有货币，对物品也没有超越所有权的内在价值；一个地精偷来的或用武力夺来的锡杯，其价值远远超过在路边发现的一整箱黄金。地精通常会收藏从受害者身上夺取的物品，有时是硬币或类似的东西，但更多的是身体部位，耳朵、手和头皮是最常见的战利品。",
	"To a gnoll, the clan is everything. Individuals may disagree, fight, or even kill each other, but the good of the clan comes before all else. While outward aggression is encouraged, subterfuge and betrayal are great taboos in gnoll society and incur the harshest punishments: more often than not, execution by ritual cannibalism. Children of the clan are raised communally, with most adult clan members contributing to their education and growth. ": "对一个地精来说，部族就是一切。个人可能会有分歧、争斗，甚至互相残杀，但氏族的利益高于一切。虽然鼓励外在的侵略行为，但在地精社会中潜伏和背叛是极大的禁忌，会招致最严厉的惩罚：通常是通过吃人仪式来处决。氏族的孩子们被共同抚养，大多数成年氏族成员为他们的教育和成长做出贡献。",
	"This innate need to be part of a clan means that gnoll pups raised amongst civilized races can become fiercely loyal to the ‘parent' who raised them, though they will keep a vicious nature, and a desire to assert physical dominance. For this reason, gnoll clans are occasionally targeted by slavers, aiming to kill the adults and sell the pups to the highest bidder (generally for bodyguard or gladiatorial services), although this often ends badly for the slavers in question. ": "这种与生俱来的成为部族一员的需要意味着，在文明种族中长大的地精幼崽会对养育他们的 \"父母 \"产生强烈的忠诚，尽管他们会保持凶恶的本性，并渴望维护身体的主导地位。由于这个原因，地精氏族偶尔会成为奴隶主的目标，目的是杀死成年地精并将幼崽卖给出价最高的人（一般是为了保镖或角斗士服务），尽管这对有关的奴隶主来说往往结局很糟糕。",
	"Shamans form the spiritual center of gnoll culture. Usually the oldest female, and often the mother of senior clan members, the shaman imparts the will of the gnoll gods to the clan, as well as performing rudimentary rituals and rites, including healing and simple divination, generally fueled by a great deal of blood. Many shamans possess abilities similar to lycanthropy: they can change form to that of a large hyena at will, allowing them to hunt with the pack and travel at speed. These abilities are the result of grisly rituals centered around the desecration of graves, and consumption of disinterred corpses, preferably those of notable virtue in life. ": "萨满构成了地精文化的精神中心。萨满通常是最年长的女性，而且往往是高级部族成员的母亲，她将地精之神的意志传授给部族，并进行基本的仪式和典礼，包括治疗和简单的占卜，通常由大量的血液来推动。许多巫师拥有类似于狼人的能力：他们可以随心所欲地变换成大土狼的形态，使他们能够与狼群一起狩猎，并快速旅行。这些能力是以亵渎坟墓为中心的可怕仪式的结果，并食用被埋葬的尸体，最好是那些在生活中具有显著美德的尸体。",
	"There are three distinct species of gnoll; the powerful and aggressive {@race Plains Gnoll|RotH|plains gnoll}, the cowardly and opportunistic gutter gnoll, and the cunning and elusive {@race rock Gnoll|RotH|rock gnoll}. ": "有三种截然不同的地精；强大而好斗的地精（%0%），胆小而投机的地精，以及狡猾而捉摸不定的地精（%1%）。",
	"Gutter gnolls once inhabited the mountains, canyons and badlands of the world. However, over time, they have been driven out (from the former by the stealthier and more intelligent rock gnolls, and from the latter by the more powerful {@race Plains Gnoll|RotH|plains gnolls}), and now they exist almost solely as parasites on larger civilized communities. Although only slightly smaller than plains gnolls in height, gutter gnolls are much more lightly built. Their pelts are long and shaggy and, consequently, are generally matted with all manner of stinking filth; as the old dwarven saying goes, \"If you smell a sewer in the mountains, walk the other way.\"  ": "沟渠地精曾经居住在世界的山脉、峡谷和坏境中。然而，随着时间的推移，他们被赶走了（前者被更隐蔽、更聪明的岩石地精赶走，后者被更强大的（%0%）赶走），现在他们几乎只作为较大文明社区的寄生虫而存在。虽然在身高上只比平原地精略小，但水沟地精的身材要轻巧得多。他们的皮毛长而蓬松，因此，通常会沾上各种恶臭的污物；正如矮人的老话所说，\"如果你在山上闻到下水道的气味，就走另一条路。\"",
	"As a quirk of their urban habitat, it is not uncommon to see gutter gnolls dressed in the ruined remains of discarded finery; sporting moldering and filthy silk shirts, rotting doublets and, in one recorded instance, what was thought to have once been a ball gown, complete with crinoline, all haphazardly forced over whichever body parts will fit in them. ": "作为他们城市居住环境的一个怪癖，经常可以看到地沟鼠穿着被遗弃的装饰品；穿着发霉和肮脏的丝绸衬衫、腐烂的连衣裙，在一个记录的例子中，被认为是曾经的舞会长袍，配有衬裙，所有这些都被胡乱地强加在身体的任何部分上，以适应它们。",
	"Gutter gnolls travel in groups usually numbering in single digits, but occasionally up to fifteen or so, led by a dominant pair. At the age of five, young males will leave their clan and, unless they happen to inhabit a huge city capable of supporting multiple gnoll clans, undertake a dangerous journey to another settlement. These gnolls often trail or stow away on trade caravans for at least part of their journey, as they know that these typically only travel between places large enough to support a population of gutter gnolls to join. ": "沟渠地精成群结队地旅行，人数通常为个位数，但偶尔也会达到15人左右，由一对主导者领导。在五岁时，年轻的雄性会离开他们的部族，除非他们碰巧居住在一个能够支持多个地精部族的巨大城市里，否则会进行一次危险的旅行，前往另一个定居点。这些地精经常跟踪或偷渡到贸易商队，至少在他们的旅程中是这样，因为他们知道这些商队通常只在足够大的地方之间旅行，以支持地精人口的加入。",
	"Gutter gnolls are cowards and will only attack where they have a clear upper hand and little risk of suffering retribution. It is this, rather than any level of self-control, which allows them to exist amongst more civilized races. A {@race Plains Gnoll|RotH|plains gnoll}, finding itself surrounded by townspeople, would embark on a rampaging killing spree until it was finally brought down, but gutter gnolls' natural caution allows them to eke out a living on scraps, carrion, and those who fall through the cracks.": "沟渠地精是个胆小鬼，只有在他们明显占上风且几乎没有遭受报复的风险时才会发动攻击。正是这一点，而不是任何程度的自我控制，使得他们能够在更多的文明种族中存在。一个{@race Plains Gnoll|RotH|plains gnoll}，发现自己被城镇居民包围，就会开始疯狂杀戮，直到最后被打倒，但阴沟地精天生的谨慎让他们靠残羹剩饭、腐肉和那些掉进缝隙的人勉强维持生计。",
	"Gutter gnolls are most likely to be found on the fringes of civilization, with larger settlements often containing a handful of menacing sewers and communal middens which may be utilized by local thugs as a ‘waste disposal service'. A tell-tale sign that gutter gnolls have claimed an area is their habit of caching ‘food' (anything from rotting offal to discarded leather) for later consumption. It is common for folk of the settlement to have never seen a gutter gnoll, but they make their presence felt–they will usually keep their diet to rats and a few stray dogs where possible, but it is only a matter of time before a laborer needs to maintain the sewers, a vagrant chooses the wrong alley to bed down for the night, or a child slips into a grate, and is never seen again. ": "阴沟地精最有可能在文明的边缘被发现，较大的定居点往往包含一些威胁性的下水道和公共垃圾场，可能被当地暴徒用作 \"废物处理服务\"。沟渠地精称霸一个地区的一个明显标志是他们习惯于藏匿 \"食物\"（从腐烂的内脏到丢弃的皮革等任何东西），以便日后食用。对于居住区的居民来说，从未见过水沟鼠是很常见的，但是他们会感觉到自己的存在--他们通常会在可能的情况下把食物留给老鼠和几只流浪狗，但是在一个工人需要维护下水道、一个流浪者选择错误的巷子过夜、或者一个孩子滑进炉子里之前，这只是时间问题。",
	"Within their territory, the clan will have a main den; this is an area large enough to fit the entire clan (gutter gnolls have few personal boundaries), but small enough to be easily defended. This area is easily identified as it contains all of the clan's ‘treasures' strewn among bits and pieces of cloth, furnishings, and other piled detritus, horribly stained, damp, and covered in matted, loose hair. ": "在他们的领地内，氏族会有一个主要的巢穴；这是一个大到足以容纳整个氏族的区域（阴沟地精几乎没有个人界限），但又小到易于防守。这个区域很容易辨认，因为它包含了族人所有的 \"宝物\"，散落在零碎的布匹、家具和其他堆积的杂物中，沾满了可怕的污渍、潮湿，并布满了散乱的头发。",
	"Gutter gnolls are more driven by their animal nature than other types and, like animals, are easily bribed with food. Most will have a basic grasp of the dominant language of the settlement they inhabit, often corrupting it with elements of Gnoll to form a simple pidgin language, which they will mostly use to communicate with criminal elements. ": "与其他类型的地精相比，地精更受其动物性的驱使，而且像动物一样，很容易被食物收买。大多数人对他们居住地的主流语言有基本的掌握，通常会用地精的元素来腐蚀它，形成一种简单的混合语言，他们主要用来与犯罪分子交流。",
	"Most people, if they are aware of the gnoll population at all, see them as little more than feral animals, so tend to talk candidly in front of them. This, and their easily cowed nature, makes them a potentially valuable resource should any law enforcement be desperate for information about criminal doings. Should they underestimate the gnolls as well, they may pay for said information dearly. ": "大多数人，如果他们意识到了地精的存在，就会把他们看作是野蛮的动物，所以在他们面前往往会坦率地交谈。这一点，以及他们容易被吓倒的天性，使他们在任何执法部门急于寻找犯罪行为的信息时，成为潜在的宝贵资源。如果他们也低估了地精，他们可能会为这些信息付出沉重的代价。",
	"The gnoll language is a mixture of low, guttural chatters and trumpeting hoots and wails which can carry great distances. Hyenas can understand Gnoll on a very basic level, a benefit of their shared ancestry. Gnoll is almost impossible to transcribe accurately, and attempts to do so cannot fully capture the nuances in tone and pitch which differentiate one call from another.

	"Gutter gnolls avoid open combat where possible, preferring to scout lone victims from the shadows to gang up on, incapacitate one way or another, and drag back to their lairs to be devoured. When forced into a fight, they will typically fight only to clear a path for themselves to escape. Should they bring an opponent down in the attempt, they will try to take the body with them if it is feasible to do so (especially if they can work as a team to carry it more easily).": "沟渠地精在可能的情况下避免公开的战斗，他们更喜欢从暗处侦察孤独的受害者，然后群起而攻之，以某种方式使其丧失能力，再将其拖回巢穴吞噬。当被迫进入战斗时，它们通常只为了给自己清出一条逃跑的道路。如果他们在战斗中击倒了对手，在可行的情况下，他们会试图带走尸体（特别是如果他们可以作为一个团队更容易地搬运尸体）。",
	"In their own territory, gutter gnolls are a little bolder, as they know the chances of enemy reinforcements are lower. They will often stagger their attacks, not revealing their true numbers until their victims are lured into a trap and surrounded. ": "在自己的地盘上，阴沟地精会更大胆一些，因为他们知道敌人增援的机会更少。他们常常会错开攻击，直到受害者被诱入陷阱并被包围时才会暴露出他们的真实人数。",
	"Criminal enterprises often exploit the local gutter gnoll population, using them as cheap labor, spies, or for the disposal of evidence (a meal's a meal to the gnolls). Gutter gnolls are cheaper than other criminals, as they only require food and are easy to keep in line due to their cowardly nature. While most gutter gnolls are accepting of living, quite literally, under the feet of those who inhabit the settlements they scavenge, below even the worst criminal scum, some long for greater things. ": "犯罪集团经常利用当地的阴沟地精人口，把他们当作廉价劳动力、间谍，或者用来处理证据（对阴沟地精来说，一顿饭就是一顿饭）。地沟鼠比其他罪犯更便宜，因为它们只需要食物，而且由于它们的胆小性质，很容易保持一致。虽然大多数地沟鼠接受生活，从字面上看，就是生活在那些居住在他们拾荒的定居点的人的脚下，甚至低于最糟糕的犯罪人渣，但有些人渴望更伟大的东西。",
	"The Eetik'ti (‘Those Underneath')'s arrangement with the local branch of the Jackdaws criminal enterprise started off as a typical one; a gang member was looking for somewhere to hide a body, happened into the sewers, and noticed that corpses left there disappeared almost as soon as they turned their backs to leave. It was only a matter of time before the gang's leader, Mathius, ventured below the city and found himself surrounded by stinking fur and gnashing teeth, and a deal was struck–\"Work for me, and you'll be full for the rest of your lives.\"": "Eetik'ti（\"下面的人\"）与Jackdaws犯罪企业的当地分支的安排开始时是一个典型的安排；一个团伙成员正在寻找藏匿尸体的地方，偶然进入下水道，并注意到留在那里的尸体几乎在他们转身离开时就消失了。该团伙的头目马修斯冒险进入城市下面，发现自己被臭气熏天的毛皮和咬牙切齿的声音包围，达成交易只是时间问题--\"为我工作，你们的余生就会很充实。\"",
	"Both parties uphold their side of the bargain; the Eetik'ti hide and guard the Jackdaws' treasure (or at least, the more obvious pieces which are awaiting a buyer), observe the goings on of the city from their hidden lairs, even accompany gang members on larger, riskier jobs where extra hands are needed. The Jackdaws, for their part, reward the Eetik'ti with finer and more plentiful food than they have ever sampled before. However, like any wild animal grown accustomed to receiving food from humans, the gnolls are becoming more demanding and, unknown to the crooks, their numbers have grown in the darkness.": "双方都坚持自己的交易；Eetik'ti隐藏和看守Jackdaws的财宝（或者至少是等待买家的更明显的财宝），从他们隐藏的巢穴中观察城市的动向，甚至在需要额外人手的情况下陪同帮派成员进行更大、更冒险的工作。豺狼人，就其本身而言，用比以前更精细、更丰盛的食物来回报Eetik'ti。然而，像任何习惯于从人类那里获得食物的野生动物一样，地精的要求越来越高，而且，骗子们不知道，它们的数量在黑暗中不断增加。",
	"The alpha pair, Ootakar and Kraaoh, have grown accustomed to their rich lifestyle (for gutter gnolls at least) and, recently, their demands for their services have grown greater and greater; not only food, but luxuries. The pair swagger about in silks and think themselves the epitome of high-society, even as they brush sewage from their finery. Cracks have begun to form in their relationship with the Jackdaws, who grow ever more uneasy on each job the gnolls are involved with, not knowing if their references to being hungry are a general demand for more ‘payment', or a more immediate threat. Mathius has begun only sending his most expendable cronies into the sewers, knowing it is only a matter of time before one of them doesn't make it back out. ": "这对首领Ootakar和Kraaoh已经习惯了他们富有的生活方式（至少对阴沟地精来说），最近，他们对自己的服务要求越来越高；不仅是食物，还有奢侈品。这对夫妇穿着丝绸大摇大摆地走来走去，认为自己是上流社会的缩影，即使他们把污水从他们的装饰品上刷掉。他们与豺狼人的关系已经开始出现裂痕，豺狼人对他们参与的每项工作都越来越不安，不知道他们提到的饥饿是对更多 \"报酬 \"的一般要求，还是更直接的威胁。马修斯已经开始只把他最有价值的亲信送进下水道，因为他知道，他们中的一个人迟早会出不来的。",

	"Huge and powerfully built, even a subordinate male plains gnoll is larger than all but the most unusually massive humans, especially around the neck and hunched shoulders. They are covered in a coarse, short coat of blotchy ochre fur, with a scraggly, dark mane along the back of the neck.

	"As the largest variety, and therefore the most able to take on tough opponents, plains gnolls are often well-armed and armored, incorporating scraps of chainmail, even steel plate (generally rusted and not uncommonly stained with the blood of the previous owner) into their ragged hide clothing. ": "作为最大的品种，因此最能对付强硬的对手，平原地精通常装备精良，装甲齐全，在他们褴褛的皮衣中加入了链甲的碎片，甚至是钢板（一般都是生锈的，也不乏沾有前主人的血）。",
	"Forming huge clans numbering up to one hundred, plains gnolls can easily become the dominant monstrous species over a large area. Clan hierarchy is complex, strict and competitive, with those at the top being the most able to physically dominate those below. Females are larger, tougher and more aggressive, with the lowest female outranking the highest male. This lead some early, and perhaps somewhat misogynistic, scholars to suggest that plains gnolls were hermaphroditic, or could change sex at will (claims which have since been disproven, but remain prevalent in folklore). The clan seldom moves as a whole, unless defending territory from rivals or protecting the clan-mother, but small bands of three to ten will split off to range over the clan's territory. ": "平原地精形成庞大的氏族，数量可达一百，很容易成为一个大区域内的主导畸形物种。氏族的等级制度是复杂、严格和竞争性的，处于顶端的人最有能力在身体上支配下面的人。雌性的体型更大、更强壮、更有攻击性，最低的雌性比最高的雄性更有优势。这导致一些早期的，也许有点厌恶女性的学者认为平原地精是雌雄同体的，或者可以随意改变性别（这种说法后来被推翻了，但在民间传说中仍然很普遍）。氏族很少作为一个整体移动，除非是为了防御对手的领土或保护氏族母亲，但三到十人的小队会在氏族的领土上分头行动。",
	"Plains gnolls are infamous for their stamina and tenacity. Once they have selected their quarry, whether it be a merchant caravan or a military scouting party, they will pursue it relentlessly for days, weeks, even months, never dropping their considerable pace. This method of persistence hunting ensures that, unless the target turns and fights early on in proceedings, the gnolls will encounter a worn down, exhausted foe when combat is eventually forced. The only thing which will force a plains gnoll to abandon a chase is the taboo of passing into another clan's territory unannounced.": "平原地精因其耐力和韧性而臭名昭著。一旦他们选择了他们的猎物，无论是商队还是军事侦察队，他们都会不遗余力地追击几天、几周甚至几个月，从不放松他们的步伐。这种坚持不懈的狩猎方法确保了，除非目标在进程的早期就转身战斗，否则当战斗最终被迫进行时，地精会遇到一个疲惫不堪的敌人。唯一能迫使平原地精放弃追逐的，是未经通知就进入另一个部族的领地的禁忌。",
	"Plains gnolls favor open areas where they can see prey approaching from a distance, as well as build up good momentum for a chase. Due to their large size, they are not the stealthiest creatures, but will use the environment to their advantage. Long grass and gentle hills are the optimal conditions, allowing cover and elevation, without stopping the momentum of the charge.": "平原地精喜欢开阔的地方，在那里它们可以看到远处接近的猎物，以及为追逐建立良好的势头。由于它们的体型庞大，它们不是最隐蔽的生物，但会利用环境来发挥其优势。长草和平缓的山丘是最理想的条件，可以提供掩护和海拔高度，同时又不会阻止冲锋的势头。",
	"They are not great builders, and are tough enough to withstand the elements. Where they make camp, the grass will be flattened in a rough circle as a communal area with higher status females commanding the center and the males on the periphery. Occasionally gnolls will settle briefly in the ruins of a settlement they have sacked, especially if there is more than the usual amount of plunder or corpses to devour. This may attract the attentions of other clans and, if there is food to spare, old rivalries are set aside temporarily. These periods of coming together are a time of ritual and mating and, rarely, a strong clanmother can unite the clans into a true horde. ": "他们不是伟大的建筑家，而且足够坚韧，可以抵御外界的干扰。在他们扎营的地方，草地会被平整成一个粗糙的圆圈，作为一个公共区域，地位较高的雌性在中心指挥，雄性在外围。偶尔地，地精会在他们洗劫过的定居点的废墟上短暂定居，特别是在有超过通常数量的掠夺物或尸体可供吞食的情况下。这可能会吸引其他部族的注意，如果有足够的食物，旧的竞争就会暂时搁置。这些聚集的时期是一个仪式和交配的时期，很少有一个强大的族长能将各族团结成一个真正的部落。",
	"The borders of a clan's territory are marked with effigies, usually no more than a stick topped with the painted skull of a venerated gnoll or hyena of the clan, for continuing to watch the borders after death is a great honor. At the center of each territory is a circle cleared of vegetation around a prominent landmark, such as an ancient stone circle or unusual outcrop, the raugra. Here, it is a great taboo to spill gnoll blood, and here is where the clan's shaman spends most of her days. Should a gnoll find themselves deep in another clan's territory and unable to retreat, they will find their way to the raugra. If they stay within the circle, they are safe and may be able to plead for leniency. If their pleas fall on deaf ears, as is often the case, they will usually be eaten alive as they try to flee. ": "一个部族领地的边界都有雕像，通常不过是一根棍子，上面画着该部族中受人尊敬的地精或鬣狗的头骨，因为死后继续看守边界是一种巨大的荣誉。在每个领地的中心是一个被清除了植被的圆圈，围绕着一个突出的地标，如一个古老的石圈或不寻常的突起物，即raugra。在这里，洒下地精的血是一个很大的禁忌，这里也是部族的萨满度过她大部分时间的地方。如果一个地精发现自己深陷另一个部族的领地而无法撤退，他们就会找到去raugra的路。如果他们呆在圈子里，他们是安全的，并且可能能够恳求宽大处理。如果他们的恳求被置若罔闻，就像经常发生的那样，他们通常会在试图逃跑的时候被活活吃掉。",
	"It is rare for plains gnolls to speak Common, and the bits and pieces they may have picked up are limited in use, usually being desperate, pleading last words, and expletives. Even if they were fluent, however, plains gnolls have little interest in talking with other races. For one, they are, as a rule, distrustful of non-clanmembers, even among their own species. For another, plains gnolls are, not without reason, assured of their own physical abilities; as they see it, the only reason to talk to someone is to get things from them, and they are more than capable of getting those things from them without wasting time with talk. ": "平原地精很少会说普通话，他们可能捡到的零碎的东西使用起来也很有限，通常都是绝望的、恳求的遗言和咒骂的话语。然而，即使他们能说得很流利，平原地精也没有兴趣与其他种族交谈。首先，他们通常不信任非氏族成员，即使在他们自己的物种中也是如此。另外，平原地精对自己的身体能力很有信心，这不是没有原因的；在他们看来，与人交谈的唯一原因是要从他们那里得到东西，而他们更有能力从他们那里得到这些东西，而不需要在交谈上浪费时间。",
	"Plains gnolls attack recklessly and wildly, seeking to spill as much blood as possible. Like many predators, they will work as a pack to split up their enemies and separate the weakest to surround and overwhelm. If the fight goes against them, the gnolls will signal a retreat but, unless their losses are severe, they will continue to pursue their quarry at a distance, trusting that their innate toughness will allow them to recover from their injuries before the weakened target can. ": "平原地精不顾一切地疯狂攻击，寻求尽可能多的血。像许多食肉动物一样，它们会以群居的方式来分割敌人，并将最弱的分开来包围和压倒。如果战斗不利于他们，地精会发出撤退的信号，但除非损失严重，否则他们会继续在远处追击猎物，相信他们与生俱来的坚韧会让他们在被削弱的目标之前从伤害中恢复。",
	"After a battle, the gnolls will squabble over the bodies for the right to loot and feed, with the exception of those brought down solely by one individual (these are claimed without argument). Weaker gnolls know better than to get involved, circling at the peripheries and thankful for whatever scraps they can snatch after the strongest have had their fill. ": "战斗结束后，地精们会争夺尸体，以获得掠夺和食物的权利，只有那些被一个人打倒的尸体除外（这些尸体是不需要争论的）。弱小的地精知道最好不要卷入其中，他们在外围徘徊，感谢他们在最强壮的人吃饱后能抢到任何残羹剩饭。",
	"The Taza Hwu (‘three clans') is a huge plains clan, made up of several hundred gnolls of three separate groups united under the savage claw of Zausra'a, declared Hwu'uat, queen over all gnolls. Too large to be constrained to a single territory, The Taza Hwu roves the land, recognizing no borders and seeing all gnolls as Zausra'a's rightful subjects. Zausra'a's vision of a united gnoll race is a terrifying prospect, but all who have stood against her have been swept aside, with not a trace of them left for the crows. ": "Taza Hwu（\"三族\"）是一个巨大的平原部族，由三个独立群体的数百名地精组成，在Zausra'a的野蛮爪牙下联合起来，被宣布为Hwu'uat，所有地精的女王。由于规模太大，无法被限制在一个单一的领土上，塔扎-乌乌在这片土地上游荡，不承认边界，并将所有地精视为扎斯拉的合法臣民。Zausra'a对一个统一的地精种族的愿景是一个可怕的前景，但所有反对她的人都被扫地出门，没有为乌鸦留下一丝痕迹。",
	"Years ago, after a brutal battle with the Shield-Biter orc tribe, Zausra'a's pregnant mother, Vitizi found herself alone, and clanless.

	"Zausra'a killed and devoured all three of her siblings, one in the womb, one on the birthing mat, and on the day she took her first steps (chasing down her sister who learnt to walk the day before). Her mother took this as an auspicious sign of greatness in her future. On the eve of her third birthday, they journeyed to a gathering of clans feasting in the ruins of a city sacked by orcs. Her mother declared for all to hear that Zausra'a was Hwu'uat, and that all must fall in line or challenge her claim. She faced the leaders of the three clans present in single combat, Grazzar of the Aohkar, Kikizi of the Drra, and Tzoma of the Haumt'ki, beating them to the ground and biting off their noses to mark their defeat, but allowing them to live to serve as her personal retinue, a duty they perform with near-fanatical loyalty. ": "Zausra'a杀死并吞噬了她的三个兄弟姐妹，一个在子宫里，一个在产床上，以及在她迈出第一步的那天（追赶前一天学会走路的妹妹）。她的母亲认为这是一个吉祥的信号，预示着她未来的伟大。在她三岁生日的前夕，他们来到一个被兽人洗劫过的城市的废墟上，参加一个部族的聚会。她的母亲向所有人宣布，Zausra'a是Hwu'uat，所有的人都必须服从她的命令，否则就会挑战她的主张。她在单挑中面对在场的三个部族的首领，奥卡尔的格拉扎尔、德拉的基基兹和哈姆特基的卓玛，将他们打倒在地，咬掉他们的鼻子以示失败，但允许他们活着作为她的私人随从，他们以近乎狂热的忠诚履行这一职责。",
	"Zausra'a scorns the males of the clan, permitting none in her presence and threatening with death any who dare to speak when she might hear it. It is whispered by some that she prefers the company of hyenas at night, and they point to the large numbers of crocotta accompanying her as proof. Her mother is the only one she will allow to question her decisions but, even so, in recent years her influence is waning over her increasingly unpredictable daughter.": "Zausra'a蔑视部族中的男性，不允许任何人在她面前出现，并威胁要杀死任何敢于在她可能听到的时候说话的人。有些人悄悄地说，她在晚上更喜欢与鬣狗为伴，他们指着陪伴她的大量鳄鱼作为证据。她的母亲是她唯一允许质疑她的决定的人，但即使如此，近年来她对她越来越难以预测的女儿的影响也在减弱。",
	"Those who have observed Zausra'a's rise to prominence watch The Taza Hwu with caution; while she lives, the united clans are a nearunassailable threat and a death sentence to any village which falls in her path.

Of all gnolls, they have the most impressive manes, which can deceive observers into thinking them larger than they truly are. While rock gnolls are certainly the least threatening variety on their own merits, the creeping influence of the caves below means they are also the most likely to exhibit vampirism, demonic possession, or otherworldly corruption, so seasoned travelers know not to take their smaller stature at face value.": "小而粗壮（就地精而言），岩石地精的平均体型与一个肌肉发达的人类差不多。在所有的地精中，它们有最令人印象深刻的鬃毛，这可以欺骗观察者，使他们认为它们比真正的大。虽然岩石地精本身肯定是威胁最小的品种，但下面洞穴的蠕动影响意味着它们也最有可能表现出吸血鬼、恶魔附身或其他世界的腐败，所以经验丰富的旅行者知道不要把它们较小的身材当作表面价值。",
	"As the smallest species, rock gnolls rely on stealth and cunning more than brute strength. They rarely form groups of more than twenty, allowing them to conceal their movements more easily. They inhabit caves during the day and foray out only under the cover of night. When left to their own devices, rock gnolls congregate in loose bands, ofen consisting of a single extended family. Infghting is rarer than in other gnoll clans, so rock gnolls tend to live longer - sometimes up to forty years. Skirting the shallows of the deep below, however, ofen brings them into contact with far more powerful entities, and it is not uncommon to fnd large number of rock gnolls under the thrall of a subterranean warlord.": "作为最小的物种，岩石地精更多的是依靠隐蔽和狡猾，而不是蛮力。他们很少组成超过20人的团体，这使他们能够更容易地隐藏自己的行动。它们白天居住在山洞里，只有在夜晚的掩护下才会出来活动。当他们自行处理时，岩怪会聚集在松散的队伍中，通常由一个大家庭组成。战斗比其他地精氏族更少，所以岩石地精往往活得更久--有时长达四十年。然而，在地下深处的浅滩上游荡，使他们与更强大的实体接触，在地下军阀的控制下发现大量的岩怪并不罕见。",
	"Rock gnolls are the most likely to take victims alive for two reasons. Firstly, their environment is the least bountiful of all the gnolls, so many clans keep a \"larder\" of fresh meat when times are good to prepare for leaner times ahead. Secondly, their ties to the underground races make them an ideal link to the surface, and the demand for slaves below is constant. Rock gnolls are generally willing to trade their stock for supplies (assuming the interested party proves sufciently strong that the gnolls could not simply take them by force), and are particularly amenable to offers of alcohol, which they have neither the ingredients nor the skills to make themselves.": "岩石地精是最有可能活捉受害者的，原因有二。首先，他们的环境是所有地精中最不丰饶的，所以许多部族在形势好的时候会保留一个新鲜肉的 \"储藏室\"，为未来的贫瘠时期做准备。其次，他们与地下种族的联系使他们成为与地表的理想联系，而地表对奴隶的需求是持续的。岩石地精通常愿意用他们的存货换取物资（假设感兴趣的一方证明足够强大，地精不能简单地用武力夺取他们），并且特别愿意接受酒精的提议，因为他们既没有原料也没有技能自己制造。",
	"As the name suggests, rock gnolls are ofen encountered in mountainous areas, canyons and caves, anywhere where their greyish hides help them blend in, and there are plenty of crags and overhangs to provide cover from searching eyes.": "顾名思义，岩怪经常出现在山区、峡谷和洞穴中，在任何地方，他们灰色的皮囊都能帮助他们混入其中，而且有大量的峭壁和悬崖提供掩护，以避免被人发现。",
	"Industrious by gnoll standards, rock gnolls construct crude dwellings from piled stone, and some clans are able to scavenge enough wood for roofs or cages as temporary housing for slaves before they are traded on. The readiest source of wood for most clans comes in the form of passing caravans, so it is not uncommon for a merchant or caravan guard to fnd themselves imprisoned in the remains of their own wagon before being sold off to some denizen of the deep caves.": "以地精的标准来看，岩石地精很勤劳，他们用堆积的石头建造简陋的住所，有些部族能够搜刮到足够的木材来建造屋顶或笼子，作为奴隶在被交易之前的临时住所。对大多数部族来说，最便捷的木材来源是过往的商队，所以商人或商队守卫发现自己被囚禁在自己的马车残骸中，然后被卖给深山洞穴中的某个居民，这种情况并不罕见。",
	"Rock gnolls are the most likely to cooperate with other races, as trade makes up a good part of their means of survival. Common and Undercommon are fairly likely to be spoken, but some clans might also pick up scraps of Dwarven and Elvish dependent on who lives in the area to trade. Rock gnolls are also the least likely to fght to the death, possessing neither the brutish savagery of {@race Plains Gnoll|RotH|plains gnolls} or the feral nature of {@race Gutter Gnoll|RotH|Gutter gnolls}. Given their usual interactions, a surrendering rock gnoll expects to be taken into slavery, a fate it may later escape if it can utilize its cunning.": "岩石地精是最有可能与其他种族合作的，因为贸易构成了他们生存手段的重要部分。他们很可能会说普通话和暗语，但有些部族也可能会根据住在该地区的人进行交易，捡起矮人和精灵语的残渣。岩石地精也是最不可能战斗到死的，他们既没有（%0%）的野蛮，也没有（%1%）的野性。考虑到他们通常的互动，一个投降的岩石地精会被带去做奴隶，如果它能利用自己的狡猾，以后可能会逃脱这种命运。",
	"Rock gnolls plan their attacks more thoroughly than other types, hanging back until they can utilize the environment to their best advantage. They may even make use of crude traps, or set up hazards to drive their quarry into a more advantageous ambush site. Rock gnolls prefer to take live captives where possible, but won't hesitate to kill any who seem like they may be more trouble than they're worth. Tey also have no compunctions about selling damaged goods, so are happy to seriously wound their quarry before returning home.": "岩石地精比其他类型的地精更彻底地计划他们的攻击，在他们能够利用环境的最佳优势之前，他们一直在后方徘徊。它们甚至可以利用粗糙的陷阱，或者设置危险，把猎物赶到更有利的伏击地点。岩石地精喜欢在可能的情况下抓活的，但也会毫不犹豫地杀死那些看起来比他们的价值更麻烦的人。岩石地精对出售损坏的货物也没有任何顾虑，所以他们很乐意在回家之前重伤他们的猎物。",
	"Amongst gnolls, demonic possession is normally viewed as a favor from their gods. Afer all, a demon will make its host behave more aggressively, enhancing its animal savagery and, from a gnoll's perspective, what could be better?": "在地精中，恶魔附身通常被看作是他们的神灵的恩惠。毕竟，恶魔会让它的主人表现得更有攻击性，增强其动物的野蛮性，从地精的角度来看，还有什么比这更好呢？",
	"Any member of the Iwa Eeni (‘Rock Ghosts') could be possessed by the demon known as Bowda at any time, although it seems to favor the clan's shaman, Graon. The demon's presence weakens and tires its host over time, however, so Bowda flits between the shaman and other clan members to keep its collection of hosts in the best possible condition. Bowda rewards the gnolls' service with enhanced senses, and some basic divination, gifing them extra insight into the goings on in the area to more accurately locate passing traders and caravans, allowing them to plan the most effective attacks.": "Iwa Eeni（\"岩鬼\"）的任何成员都可能在任何时候被称为Bowda的恶魔附身，尽管它似乎更喜欢该部族的萨满Graon。然而，随着时间的推移，恶魔的存在会削弱并使其宿主疲惫，所以Bowda在萨满和其他氏族成员之间穿梭，以保持其收集的宿主处于最佳状态。鲍达用增强的感官和一些基本的占卜来回报地精的服务，给予他们对该地区情况的额外洞察力，以更准确地定位过往的商人和商队，使他们能够计划最有效的攻击。",
	"As with all things, however, Bowda does not do this out of the goodness of its heart (not that it has one), but is manipulating the Iwa Eeni towards its own purpose. The slaves caught by the gnolls are primarily traded with a group representing the Brabus family, a powerful family of dark elves who dwell in the unfathomable underground depths. In their excavations and expansions, the dark elves are, unknowingly, nearing a subterranean altar (of unknown but ancient origin) dedicated to Bowda, and a constant supply of fresh slaves ensures that, sooner or later, they will stumble across it. Should the dark elves, with their predilection for demon worship, discover and make the proper sacrifces at the altar, Bowda's full power shall be unleashed on the world": "然而，就像所有的事情一样，鲍达这样做并不是出于善意（并不是说它有善意），而是为了自己的目的操纵伊瓦-埃尼。地精抓到的奴隶主要是与代表布拉布斯家族的团体进行交易，布拉布斯家族是一个强大的黑暗精灵家族，居住在深不可测的地下深处。在他们的挖掘和扩张中，黑暗精灵不知不觉地接近了一个供奉鲍达的地下祭坛（起源不明但很古老），而新鲜奴隶的持续供应确保了他们迟早会偶然发现它。如果黑暗精灵，以他们对恶魔崇拜的偏爱，发现并在祭坛上做出适当的牺牲，鲍达的全部力量将被释放到世界上。",
	"Unaware that they are pieces in a much larger game, the Iwa Eeni simply view Bowda as a blessing, and a sign that theirs is the pinnacle of the gnoll way of life.": "由于不知道自己是一个更大的游戏中的棋子，伊瓦-埃尼人只是把鲍达看作是一种祝福，并表明他们的生活方式是地精的巅峰。",
