	"Welcome to Badooga's Exploration Guidelines! This document summarizes all of my thoughts on and homebrew for the exploration pillar of D&D 5e. Whether you are fine with the official exploration rules, are looking for your own replacement, or already have your own homebrew set up for it, this document is bound to have something beneficial for you to use or take inspiration from.": "欢迎来到Badooga的探索指南! 这份文件总结了我对D&D 5e的探索支柱的所有想法和自制内容。无论你对官方的探索规则是否满意，是否在寻找自己的替代物，或者已经有了自己的自制物，这份文件一定会有一些有益的东西供你使用或从中获得灵感。",
	"The first chapter, {@b Analyzing the Official Rules}, takes a dive into how exploration is handled in normal 5e and separates the good from the bad. The key takeaways from this chapter are then used to help guide the options presented in the rest of the document.": "第一章，{@b Analyzing the Official Rules}，深入探讨了探索在普通5e中的处理方式，并将好与坏分开。这一章的主要收获被用来帮助指导本文件其余部分的选项。",
	"Then we have the {@b Expanded Options} chapter, which provides small, modular options that a DM can pick and choose from. It includes various rewards to help incentivize your party to explore, extra hazards and effects to help spice up your wilderness regions, and a collection of variant and optional rules that help fix certain aspects of the game that you might not like.": "然后，我们有{@b Expanded Options}章节，它提供了小型的、模块化的选项，管理员可以从中挑选。它包括各种奖励，以帮助激励你的队伍进行探索；额外的危险和效果，以帮助调剂你的荒野地区；还有一系列变体和可选规则，以帮助修复游戏中你可能不喜欢的某些方面。",
	"Next is the {@b Exploration Revised} chapter, which presents a streamlined, easy-to-read ruleset for exploration that modifies the official rules scattered throughout the {@book Player's Handbook|phb} and {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}. It lists out the rules that govern interacting with and traveling through the wilderness, and it gives a step by step guide on how to run exploration and travel on a day by day basis.": "接下来是{@b Exploration Revised}一章，它提出了一个精简的、易于阅读的探索规则集，修改了散布在{@book Player's Handbook|phb}和{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中的官方规则。它列出了与荒野互动和在荒野中旅行的规则，并一步一步地指导如何逐日进行探索和旅行。",
	"The final chapter is {@b Running Exploration}, which provides advice and principles to help guide your exploration-based game sessions, as well as an expansion of the rules in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg} on how to make your own wilderness regions for brave adventurers to explore.": "最后一章是{@b Running Exploration}，它提供了建议和原则，以帮助指导你基于探索的游戏环节，以及{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中关于如何制作你自己的荒野地区供勇敢的冒险家探索的规则的扩展。",
	"The {@b Appendix} provides three sample regions that you can insert into your campaign with ease. Each one is built using the rules and guidelines presented in the Running Exploration chapter, as a demonstration of what it can be used for.": "{@b Appendix}提供了三个样本区域，你可以轻松地插入你的活动中。每一个都是使用 \"运行探索 \"一章中提出的规则和指南建立的，作为它的用途的示范。",
	"This document was written by me, badooga. My other homebrew, including a document akin to this one called \"Badooga's Monster Guidelines\", can be found on {@link GM Binder|https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/badooga}, {@link Google Drive|https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jr6F4BLbOAfKQ_EtUQyZ6aa_3jijp3gn?usp=sharing}, or 5eTools (go to the Homebrew Manager > Get Homebrew > type \"badooga\").

	"Those of you on Discord who gave feedback on this document, no matter how small or nitpicky, deserve a special shoutout for helping me edit and polish this document into what it is today. Several of you even playtested a variety of the rules found in this document and found that they worked well for you, which is pleasant to hear.": "那些在Discord上对这份文件提供反馈的人，无论多么细小或吹毛求疵，都值得特别鸣谢，因为他们帮助我编辑和打磨了这份文件，使其成为今天的样子。你们中的一些人甚至测试了本文档中的各种规则，发现它们对你们来说很有效，这让我很高兴。",
	"Finally, note that a lot of content from the {@i Unearthed Arcana: Into the Wilds} document was copied and edited/elaborated on/transformed within this document. Most notably, my Running Exploration chapter uses the Describing the Wilds section, and my Appendix includes the Moon Hills sample region.": "最后，请注意，{@i Unearthed Arcana: Into the Wilds}文件中的很多内容在本文件中被复制和编辑/阐述/转化了。最明显的是，我的《运行探索》一章使用了《描述荒野》一节，我的附录包括了《月亮山》样本区。",
	"It is necessary to examine the official rules for exploration and to identify their flaws before any homebrew alternatives can be made for it.": "在为其制定任何自制的替代方案之前，有必要检查官方的探索规则并找出其缺陷。",
	"The rules for exploration are mainly focused on traveling from one location to another.": "探索的规则主要集中在从一个地点到另一个地点的旅行。",
	"The PHB lists travel rules for moving at a slow pace, a normal pace, or a fast pace. Moving at a slow pace allows the party to use stealth, and traveling at a fast pace makes it harder for the party to notice incoming threats. By itself, this is pretty good.": "PHB列出了慢速、正常速度或快速移动的旅行规则。慢速行进允许队伍使用隐身术，而快速行进使队伍更难注意到即将到来的威胁。就其本身而言，这是很好的。",
	"One thing to note is that these travel paces assume there is nothing hindering the party's movement. If obstacles do get in their way, the PHB recommends using difficult terrain, which halves the party's movement. However, isn't this a bit drastic? What happens in an environment that is untamed and complex to navigate, but otherwise isn't difficult terrain?": "有一点需要注意的是，这些行进速度是假设没有任何障碍物阻碍队伍的移动。如果有障碍物挡住了他们的去路，PHB建议使用困难地形，这将使他们的行动减半。然而，这是不是有点过激了？在一个未被驯服的、复杂的环境中会发生什么，但在其他方面却不是困难地形？",
	"The PHB and DMG list out a few example activities the party can do while traveling. Here is a list of all of them:": "法典》和DMG列出了党派在旅行中可以做的一些活动实例。以下是所有这些活动的清单。",
	"{@b Drawing a Map:} drawing a map that can help to avoid becoming lost": "{@b Drawing a Map:}画一张地图，可以帮助避免迷路",
	"{@b Foraging:} finding food and water to avoid starvation or dehydration": "{@b Foraging:}寻找食物和水以避免饥饿或脱水",
	"{@b Navigating:} making checks to avoid becoming lost": "{@b Navigating:}进行检查以避免迷路",
	"{@b Noticing Threats:} staying alert and using your passive Perception to avoid a hidden threat": "{@b Noticing Threats:}保持警惕并使用你的被动感知力来避免隐藏的威胁",
	"{@b Tracking:} following the tracks of another creature": "{@b Tracking:}跟随另一生物的足迹",
	"Do you notice how all of these activities are about constantly avoiding stuff? Other than tracking, none of these activities really cause anything new to happen or for the party to succeed at anything. In other words, none of them actually involve active exploration - they are almost just a form of busywork.": "你是否注意到所有这些活动都是在不断地回避东西？除了追踪之外，这些活动都没有真正导致任何新的事情发生，或者让当事人在任何事情上取得成功。换句话说，它们都没有真正涉及积极的探索--它们几乎只是一种忙碌的形式。",
	"The rules for becoming lost deserve a special mention here. When in the wilderness and not following a marked path, the rules expect the party navigator to make repeated checks to avoid becoming lost. While lost, the party wanders in a random direction, and the navigator must repeat the check in order to get back on track.": "这里值得特别一提的是关于迷路的规则。在荒野中，如果不沿着有标记的道路前进，规则希望聚会的领航员能够反复检查以避免迷路。当迷路时，队伍会在一个随机的方向上徘徊，领航员必须重复检查，以便重新回到正轨。",
	"Does any of that scream \"competent adventurers\" to you? These rules for becoming lost are worse than busywork - if you fail to avoid becoming lost, you and your entire party will end up wandering around like headless chickens, and will waste a lot of your time on trying to get back on track.": "这是否让你感到 \"合格的冒险者\"？这些关于迷路的规则比忙乱更糟糕--如果你不能避免迷路，你和你的整个队伍最终会像无头鸡一样四处游荡，并且会在试图回到轨道上浪费大量时间。",
	"Travel is the medium through which exploration can take place. After all, you can't explore anything if you just sit still and don't go anywhere. With that in mind, it's necessary to have rules for how travelers can actually discover things while exploring, as well as rules for what specific things they might discover.": "旅行是可以进行探索的媒介。毕竟，如果你只是坐着不动，哪里都不去，你就无法探索任何东西。考虑到这一点，有必要为旅行者如何在探索中实际发现事物制定规则，以及为他们可能发现的具体事物制定规则。",
	"The DMG has a great section that describes how to fill a wilderness region that is 50 miles across. It discusses how many monster lairs and settlements such a region can support, as well as a few other location types that could be interesting to explore. This section is a great starting point for DMs that wish to build their own setting or to otherwise create a wilderness region for their party to explore.": "DMG有一个很好的章节，描述了如何填满一个50英里宽的荒野地区。它讨论了这样一个地区可以支持多少个怪物巢穴和定居点，以及其他一些可能有趣的探索地点类型。对于希望建立自己的环境或以其他方式为他们的队伍创造一个荒野地区来进行探索的管理员来说，这一部分是一个很好的起点。",
	"Building off of the random encounter rules in the DMG, chapter 2 of XGE has a section that lists multiple random encounter tables for each environment category: arctic, coastal, desert, forest, grassland, hill, mountain, swamp, Underdark, underwater, and urban. In tandem with the Mapping a Wilderness section discussed above, these random encounter tables can be used to make a region of wilderness region feel alive and dangerous.": "基于DMG中的随机遭遇规则，XGE的第2章有一节列出了每个环境类别的多个随机遭遇表：北极、沿海、沙漠、森林、草原、山地、沼泽、地下城、水下和城市。与上面讨论的 \"绘制荒野 \"一节相配合，这些随机遭遇表可以用来使荒野地区感觉到活力和危险。",
	"So, with these tools to help them, it is possible for a DM to handcraft their own unique and exciting game world. But do the official rules for exploration allow the players to interact with it in meaningful ways?": "因此，有了这些工具的帮助，DM就有可能手工制作他们自己的独特和令人兴奋的游戏世界。但官方的探索规则是否允许玩家以有意义的方式与之互动？",
	"The answer is: \"not really\". Other than drawing a map, following tracks, and looking out for creature encounters, the exploration pillar doesn't really interact with the setting the game is taking place in. It expects the DM to simply hand discoveries to them as they see fit (assuming that the party hasn't gotten lost on their way there), and to mainly use the exploration rules as a form of busywork.": "答案是：\"不是真的\"。除了绘制地图、追踪足迹和注意生物的遭遇之外，探索支柱并不真正与游戏发生的环境互动。它期望DM只是在他们认为合适的时候把发现交给他们（假设聚会在途中没有迷路），并且主要把探索规则作为一种忙碌的形式。",
	"If exploration in D&D was easy, then it probably wouldn't be that fun. After all, one of the main draws of exploration is the risk and danger involved in it.": "如果D&D中的探索很容易，那么它可能就不会那么有趣了。毕竟，探索的主要吸引力之一是其中的风险和危险。",
	"At the end of the day, D&D is built around combat. However, the default length of an adventuring day causes issues with encounter balancing and pacing. The DMG expects most adventuring days to involve enough combat encounters to require the party to take two short rests. However, keeping up with a rate of about three encounters per day slows travel down to a crawl, turning most journeys into a bit of a slog. The alternative is to only run about one encounter per day, which doesn't properly challenge the party and should be avoided at all times.": "说到底，D&D是围绕战斗而建立的。然而，一个冒险日的默认长度会导致遭遇战平衡和节奏方面的问题。DMG预计，大多数冒险日都会有足够的战斗遭遇，需要队伍进行两次短暂的休息。然而，保持每天大约三次遭遇的速度，会使旅行变得缓慢，使大多数旅程变得有点艰难。另一种方法是每天只遇到一次，这并不能适当地挑战队伍，任何时候都应该避免。",
	"Luckily, the {@variantrule Rest Variants|dmg|Gritty Realism} resting variant can be used to stretch the length of an adventuring day across multiple in-game days, allowing the DM to run one encounter per in-game day with no issues. However, if the party happens to discover a dungeon while exploring, gritty realism will not be adequate. You could switch between the two rulesets as needed, but that isn't a good option for all games. The best solution is a new rest variant that is similar to gritty realism, but can accomodate for changes in encounter pacing without too many issues.": "幸运的是，{@variantrule Rest Variants|dmg|Gritty Realism}休息变体可以用来将一个冒险日的长度延伸到多个游戏日中，让DM在每个游戏日中运行一个遭遇战而没有问题。但是，如果队伍在探索时碰巧发现了一个地牢，那么狡猾的现实主义就不充分了。你可以根据需要在两个规则集之间切换，但这并不是一个适合所有游戏的选择。最好的解决方案是一个新的休息变体，它类似于粗暴的现实主义，但可以在没有太多问题的情况下适应遭遇的节奏变化。",
	"Most humanoids need food, water, and sleep to survive. In the wilderness, all three of these necessities can't be guaranteed - a desolate wasteland might lack any game or plants to eat, a hot desert might lack regular sources of water, and a lack of shelter from stormy weather might drive the party to perform a forced march in search of a safe place to sleep.": "大多数人类需要食物、水和睡眠来生存。在荒野中，这三种必需品都无法保证--荒凉的荒地可能缺乏任何可供食用的野味或植物，炎热的沙漠可能缺乏固定的水源，而缺乏躲避暴风雨的庇护所可能会驱使队伍进行强行军，寻找一个安全的地方睡觉。",
	"However, many character features allow the party to trivialize survival with ease. With just a single 1st-level spell slot, the {@spell goodberry} spell can provide nourishment to the entire party for an entire day. By spending 11 minutes to cast the {@spell Leomund's tiny hut} spell, the party bard or wizard can provide the entire party with a safe place to sleep for the night. The Natural Explorer class feature allows a ranger that is in their favored terrain to find twice as much food while foraging, and also invalidates many of the other aspects of exploration discussed earlier.": "然而，许多角色特征允许党派轻松地将生存琐碎化。只需一个一级法术槽，{@spell goodberry}法术就能为整个队伍提供一整天的营养。花费11分钟施展{@spell Leomund's tiny hut}法术，聚会的吟游诗人或巫师可以为整个聚会提供一个安全的地方来过夜。自然探险家的等级特征可以让处于他们喜欢的地形的游侠在觅食时找到两倍的食物，同时也使前面讨论的许多其他方面的探索失效。",
	"Wilderness hazards, weather phenomena, and regional effects like harsh storms, slippery ice, and planar effects can all act as significant obstacles to the party's travels. They primarily contribute to creature encounters, but can also force the party's to make important decisions about where, when, and how to travel.": "荒野危险、天气现象和区域效应，如恶劣的风暴、湿滑的冰层和平面效应，都可以成为队伍旅行的重要障碍。它们主要有助于生物的遭遇，但也会迫使队伍对旅行的地点、时间和方式做出重要决定。",
	"While these weather phenomena and wilderness hazards presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg} are adequate enough in normal situations, they fail to acknowledge one simple fact: in a world of dragons, fiends, and magic, surviving in the wilderness requires adventurers to face off against fantastical effects and supernatural hazards. If this is the case, why are most of the natural hazards in the DMG mundane in nature? While some 5e books seek to address this (e.g. {@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce} includes a selection of supernatural environments), it is still a shame that almost all of the natural hazards in the DMG are things that could easily be found in real life.": "虽然在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中介绍的这些天气现象和荒野危险在正常情况下已经足够了，但它们没有承认一个简单的事实：在一个有龙、恶魔和魔法的世界中，在荒野中生存需要冒险者面对奇异的效果和超自然的危险。如果是这样的话，为什么DMG中的大多数自然危害都是世俗的呢？虽然一些5e书籍试图解决这个问题（例如{@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce}包括一个超自然环境的选择），但DMG中几乎所有的自然危害都是在现实生活中很容易找到的东西，这仍然是一个耻辱。",
	"We can summarize the flaws discussed above in a list of points that are easy to digest.": "我们可以把上面讨论的缺陷总结为一个易于消化的要点清单。",
	"The obstacles provided by the official books are mostly mundane, and can easily be trivialized by spells, class features, and other character options. In addition, the default rules for resting are at odds with most reasonable encounter pacings while exploring.": "官方书籍提供的障碍物大多是平凡的，而且很容易被法术、等级特征和其他角色选项所淡化。此外，默认的休息规则与探索过程中大多数合理的遭遇间隔不一致。",
	"Many of the rules for exploration are focused on constantly keeping track of resources and such. Many DMs that run exploration by the books will quickly find themselves and their players to be tired of the monotony and tedious bookkeeping.": "许多探索的规则都集中在不断地追踪资源等方面。许多按部就班进行探索的管理员会很快发现他们自己和他们的玩家对单调乏味的记账工作感到厌倦。",
	"While the official books do provide resources on how to make interesting game worlds, the rules for exploration do not interact with such worlds in an interesting and satisfying way.": "虽然官方书籍确实提供了如何制作有趣的游戏世界的资源，但探索的规则并没有以有趣和令人满意的方式与这种世界互动。",
	"In this case, \"rewards\" refers to tangible results caused by the players' successes. Instead of rolling to achieve something, the official rules have the players roll to not fail at something (e.g. to not get lost).": "在这种情况下，\"奖励 \"是指由玩家的成功引起的有形结果。官方规则不是让玩家通过掷骰子来实现某种目标，而是让玩家通过掷骰子来避免失败（例如不迷路）。",
	"At the time of this writing, I have invested 1,767 hours into the Legendary Edition of Skyrim, and plenty more time picking out mods and even making my own mods. While the game has many flaws, I can say with confidence that the game handles exploration itself very well. In this section, I will draw on this experience playing Skyrim to discuss how exploration can be improved in 5e.": "在写这篇文章的时候，我已经在《天际》的传奇版中投入了1767个小时，还有很多时间在挑选MOD，甚至是制作自己的MOD。虽然游戏有很多缺陷，但我可以自信地说，游戏对探索本身的处理非常好。在本节中，我将借鉴玩《天际》的这一经验来讨论如何在5e中改进探索。",
	"In Skyrim, the game is leveled to you, and is honestly a bit too easy without mods aimed to fix that. Most of the challenge comes from difficult encounters such as dragons and other bosses.": "在《天际》中，游戏是根据你的水平来确定的，如果没有旨在解决这个问题的MOD，说实话有点太容易了。大部分的挑战来自于困难的遭遇，如龙和其他老板。",
	"Additionally, vanilla Skyrim completely ignores the basic necessities of food, water, sleep, and so on. There are mods that add these to the game, such as the popular {@link Frostfall|https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?} mod that adds hypothermia and other temperature-based gameplay. These mods aren't for everyone, but can be very fun if configured correctly.": "此外，香草《天际》完全忽略了食物、水、睡眠等基本必需品。有一些MOD在游戏中加入了这些内容，比如流行的{@link Frostfall|https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?}MOD，增加了低温和其他基于温度的玩法。这些MOD并不适合每个人，但如果配置得当，也会非常有趣。",
	"For D&D, this shows that while optional rules for survival aspects of the game can and should be provided, the main way to make exploration more challenging is to address combat. To do this, we can make a resting variant that extends the length of the adventuring day to not require an unreasonable number of encounters per in-game day. Such a resting variant would also make spells and other features (e.g. {@spell goodberry}) less spammable and overbearing.": "对于D&D来说，这表明虽然可以而且应该提供游戏中生存方面的可选规则，但使探索更具挑战性的主要方法是解决战斗。为了做到这一点，我们可以制作一个休息变体，延长冒险日的长度，使其不需要在游戏中每一天都有不合理的遭遇。这样的休息变体也会使法术和其他功能（例如（%0%））变得不那么容易燃烧和霸道。",
	"Skyrim gives you an empty map of the setting and allows you to fill it up with markers as you discover them. And while fast travel might be a horrible feature, the other conveniences of being able to ignore food, water, sleep, and so on allow you to focus on what's truly important: gameplay.": "Skyrim给了你一张空的地图，并允许你在发现它们的时候用标记来填充它。虽然快速旅行可能是一个可怕的功能，但能够忽略食物、水、睡眠等其他便利条件使你能够专注于真正重要的东西：游戏。",
	"For D&D, the main way to address this is to rewrite the rules for becoming lost. Having to constantly roll to not be lost sucks. Instead, maybe we can allow the navigator to find shortcuts that get the party past obstacles and cut down on total travel time. To keep things realistic and fair, we can lower the party's normal travel pace while in the wilderness to offset that. With this, the players are rewarded for succeeding at navigating, rather than being punished for failing at it.": "对于D&D来说，解决这个问题的主要方法是重写迷路的规则。为了不迷路而不断地掷骰子，这很糟糕。相反，也许我们可以允许领航员找到捷径，让队伍越过障碍物，减少总的旅行时间。为了保持现实和公平，我们可以降低队伍在荒野中的正常旅行速度来抵消这一点。这样一来，玩家在导航方面取得成功就会得到奖励，而不是因为失败而受到惩罚。",
	"In Skyrim, the compass will reveal markers for locations that are nearby, even if you haven't discovered them yet. One of the best mods I've ever installed for Skyrim is {@link iCompass|https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56992}, which is a mod that removes these compass map markers, forcing you to find new and undiscovered locations for yourself... or to receive their location from NPCs that tell you about them.": "在《天际》中，罗盘会显示出附近地点的标记，即使你还没有发现它们。我为《天际》安装的最好的mod之一是{@link iCompass|https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56992}，这是一个删除这些罗盘地图标记的mod，迫使你自己去寻找新的和未发现的地点......或者从告诉你这些地点的NPC那里得到它们的位置。",
	"For D&D, we can emulate this by not simply allowing players to discover all locations automatically. Instead, there should be a scouting activity that allows a character to scout for nearby locations of interest. We can also add one that allows a character to gather information on the region that, in addition to being a worldbuilding tool, can help in finding nearby locations of interest. Such rules would give the players a real, tangible way to interact with the world around them.": "对于D&D，我们可以通过不简单地让玩家自动发现所有地点来模仿这一点。相反，应该有一个侦察活动，允许角色侦察附近感兴趣的地点。我们还可以增加一项活动，允许角色收集该地区的信息，除了作为世界建设的工具外，还可以帮助寻找附近感兴趣的地点。这样的规则会给玩家一个真实的、有形的方式来与周围的世界互动。",
	"Skyrim's loot system involves a vertical progression of gear that you are expected to follow as you level. Additionally, compared to D&D 5e, magic items in Skyrim are fairly commonplace and can be rewarded depending on the player's level.": "Skyrim的战利品系统涉及到装备的垂直递增，当你的等级达到一定程度时，你就会被要求遵守。此外，与D&D 5e相比，《天际》中的魔法物品是相当普遍的，并且可以根据玩家的等级来获得奖励。",
	"When it comes to rewards that aren't physical in nature, exploration in Skyrim can also yield opportunities for questing and unique NPC interactions, and it also provides opportunities for fun combat encounters, which are quicker and easier to experience in the medium of a video game compared to that of a TTRPG.": "说到非物理性质的奖励，《天际》中的探索也可以产生任务和独特的NPC互动的机会，它也提供了有趣的战斗遭遇的机会，与TTRPG相比，在视频游戏的媒介中更快、更容易体验。",
	"For D&D, the navigation changes discussed in the Engagement section can help with this. In addition, it would make sense to go over all the possible rewards for exploration that already exist in 5e, which includes consumable and common magic items, as well as supernatural gifts like charms and blessings.": "对于D&D来说，在参与部分讨论的导航变化可以帮助解决这个问题。此外，回顾一下5e中已经存在的所有可能的探索奖励也是有意义的，这包括消耗品和普通魔法物品，以及超自然的礼物，如符咒和祝福。",
	"We now know what is wrong with exploration in 5e, and we have a general sense of how we should change it. But before we create a definitive revision of the official exploration system, let's first create some modular options that DMs can pick and choose from as appropriate for their games.": "我们现在知道5e中的探索有什么问题，而且我们对应该如何改变它也有了大致的了解。但在我们对官方探索系统进行明确的修订之前，让我们先创建一些模块化的选项，让管理员可以根据自己的游戏情况进行选择。",
	"One reason why exploration is so fun (as a general concept) is that we are rewarded for doing it. What kinds of rewards can be given out for exploration in 5e?": "探索之所以如此有趣（作为一个一般的概念），原因之一是我们在做这件事时能得到奖励。在5e中，可以为探索提供什么样的奖励？",
	"By far the most common reward for exploration (and adventuring in general) is gold. Gold can be used to buy rations, armor, weapons, and other supplies whenever the party is in town. With this in mind, it is also possible to reward the party with certain items directly, instead of giving them raw gold. While the party can often sell these items for some gold, you can still use this method to control what types of items the party can access. For example, most merchants won't buy harvested ingredients, rations, or used armor the party acquired during their adventures, but the party can still use those items effectively as they explore.": "到目前为止，探索（和一般的冒险）最常见的奖励是黄金。金子可以用来购买口粮、盔甲、武器和其他用品，只要队伍在城里。考虑到这一点，也可以直接用某些物品来奖励党，而不是给他们原始的黄金。虽然党派通常可以卖掉这些物品换取一些黄金，但你仍然可以用这种方法来控制党派可以获得哪些类型的物品。例如，大多数商人不会购买党派在冒险过程中获得的收获的原料、口粮或用过的盔甲，但党派在探索过程中仍然可以有效地使用这些物品。",
	"Magic items make for the perfect exploration reward, but the way they are balanced in 5e requires some extra consideration when giving them out. Because they generally aren't an assumed part of the game, it is not recommended to give out powerful magic items nilly willy.": "魔法物品是完美的探索奖励，但在5e中它们的平衡方式需要在发放时进行一些额外考虑。因为它们通常不是游戏中假定的一部分，所以不建议随意发放强大的魔法物品。",
	"Even when a consumable item is powerful, its limited usage makes it harder to regret giving one out. Whether it's a potion, a poison, or an item with unreplenishable charges, once a consumable item is completely used, the party can no longer benefit from it. Thus, giving out consumable items is a great way to reward your party for exploration without permanently boosting their power level in a way that you might regret later on.": "即使一个消耗品很强大，其有限的使用量也让人更难后悔给了它。无论是药水、毒药，还是无法补充的物品，一旦消耗品被完全用完，玩家就无法再从它身上获益。因此，发放消耗品是奖励你的队伍进行探索的一个好方法，而不会永久地提高他们的力量水平，以至于你以后会后悔。",
	"Not all magic items have to be combat-oriented. Many items, especially those of a common or uncommon rarity, can be given to the players without fear of causing them to become overpowered or otherwise affecting the balance of the game.": "不是所有的魔法物品都必须以战斗为导向。许多物品，特别是那些常见或不常见的稀有物品，可以交给玩家而不必担心导致他们变得过于强大或影响游戏的平衡。",
	"In addition, check out this {@link Weak Magic Items|http://www.lordbyng.net/inspiration/} site for inspiration when creating your own exploration rewards from scratch.": "此外，在从头开始创建你自己的探索奖励时，请查看这个{@link Weak Magic Items|http://www.lordbyng.net/inspiration/}网站以获得灵感。",
	"In the official books, the Ritual Caster feat and similar features allow characters to learn ritual spells that they come across during their adventures. Wizards in particular can directly add spells that they find to their spellbook, making them very powerful given the right circumstances.": "在官方书籍中，仪式施法者特技和类似的功能允许角色学习他们在冒险中遇到的仪式法术。特别是魔法师可以直接将他们发现的法术添加到他们的法术书中，在适当的情况下使他们非常强大。",
	"In addition to those methods, you can also give out new spells to your other spellcasters as rewards for exploration. For example, the final chest in an underground crypt might have a magical book that gives the party warlock access to one of the dunamancy spells presented in {@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|egw}. A free spell added to their spell list or automatically learned generally won't impact a spellcaster's power levels, but is still a great reward through the opportunity for extra worldbuilding or extra flavor given to the spellcaster.": "除了这些方法之外，你还可以给你的其他法术师发放新的法术，作为探索的奖励。例如，地下墓穴的最后一个箱子可能有一本魔法书，可以让党派的术士获得{@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|egw}中提出的一个地下魔法的法术。一个免费的法术添加到他们的法术列表中或自动学习一般不会影响施法者的力量水平，但通过给施法者提供额外的世界建设机会或额外的味道，仍然是一个很好的奖励。",
	"Keep in mind that such rewards needn't be restricted to the wizard class, nor do they have to be restricted to homebrewed spells or the official dunamancy spells. For example, a primal spirit could grant the party sorcerer access to the {@spell speak with plants} spells as a reward for protecting their nature grove from undead. Be creative with how you give out such spells, and be sure to discern the power level of a specific spell before you give it out to the party.": "请记住，这种奖励不必局限于巫师等级，也不必局限于自创的法术或官方的杜纳曼斯法术。例如，一个原始的精神可以让党派的巫师获得{@spell speak with plants}的法术，作为保护他们的自然丛林不受亡灵侵害的奖励。在发放这类法术时要有创意，并确保在发放前分辨出特定法术的力量等级。",
	"Along these lines, you can also reward your spellcasters for exploring using costly material components for spells. While they may normally be equivalent to a regular gold reward, some material components might be difficult to find in your game world and may even be unavailable for purchase altogether. Thus, giving them out as a reward for exploration is a great way to gate access to specific spells while also making the players feel good about it.": "沿着这些思路，你也可以奖励你的施法者探索使用昂贵的材料组件来施法。虽然它们通常可能相当于普通的金币奖励，但有些材料组件在你的游戏世界中可能很难找到，甚至可能完全无法购买。因此，把它们作为探索的奖励发放出去是一个很好的方法，可以让玩家获得特定的法术，同时也让玩家感觉良好。",
	"Supernatural gifts, such as temporary charms or permanent blessings, can be granted as a reward instead of magic items. They work best when granted as part of a quest; for example, the party might receive a charm or blessing if they restore a hidden shrine in the mountains or successfully complete a task granted by the unicorn guardian of the forest.": "超自然的礼物，如临时符咒或永久祝福，可以作为奖励而不是魔法物品。它们在作为任务的一部分被授予时效果最好；例如，如果一行人恢复了山中隐藏的神龛或成功完成了森林独角兽守护者授予的任务，他们可能会收到一个符咒或祝福。",
	"This section details a variety of environmental features one might encounter while exploring the wilderness. They are designed to be used alongside those presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}, {@adventure Ghosts of Saltmarsh|gos}, {@adventure Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|IDRotF}, and {@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce}, and may also offer variants or expansions of options that already exist those books.": "本节详细介绍了人们在探索荒野时可能遇到的各种环境特征。它们旨在与{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}、{@adventure Ghosts of Saltmarsh|gos}、{@adventure Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|IDRotF}和{@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce}中介绍的内容一起使用，也可能提供这些书中已有的选项的变体或扩展。",
	"The entries below list examples of new weather phenomena, and may also provide variants for existing ones.": "下面的条目列出了新的天气现象的例子，也可能为现有的天气现象提供变体。",
	"The entries below list examples of supernatural effects that can influence an entire region.": "下面的条目列出了可以影响整个地区的超自然效应的例子。",
	"The entries below list examples of new wilderness hazards.": "下面的条目列出了新的荒野危险的例子。",
	"There are a variety of variant and optional rules, both official and homebrew, that you can pick and choose from in order to enhance the exploration pillar of your game.": "有各种各样的变体和可选规则，包括官方的和自制的，你可以从中挑选，以加强你游戏的探索支柱。",
	"The official options below all interact with the exploration pillar in some way.": "下面的官方选项都以某种方式与探索支柱互动。",
	"The ranger class is frequently criticized for invalidating various portions of the exploration pillar, rather than engaging with it in an interesting manner. To address this flaw, consider using the alternative ranger features presented in {@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce}. In particular, the {@classFeature Deft Explorer|Ranger||1|TCE} and {@classFeature Primal Awareness|Ranger||3|TCE} features works well at creating interesting exploration gameplay rather than skipping over it entirely.": "游侠类经常被批评为使探索支柱的各个部分失效，而不是以一种有趣的方式参与其中。为了解决这个缺陷，可以考虑使用{@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce}中提出的替代游侠特征。特别是，{@classFeature Deft Explorer|Ranger||1|TCE}和{@classFeature Primal Awareness|Ranger||3|TCE}的特征在创造有趣的探索游戏方面效果很好，而不是完全跳过它。",
	"No matter how much you change exploration, it is important to give your players regular breaks from it. One method of doing so is to give them some downtime whenever they enter safe civilization again. The {@variantrule Downtime Revisited|XGE} variant rule works best for this purpose.": "无论你如何改变探索，让你的玩家定期休息是很重要的。这样做的一个方法是，每当他们再次进入安全文明时，给他们一些休息时间。{@variantrule Downtime Revisited|XGE}的变体规则对这个目的最有效。",
	"The {@variantrule encumbrance|phb} variant heavily limits the amount of weight a single character can carry at once. When used in an exploration-based game, it can be used to impose a limit on the amount of supplies the characters can carry at a given time.": "{@variantrule encumbrance|phb}变体严重限制了单个角色一次可以携带的重量。在基于探索的游戏中使用时，它可以用来限制人物在特定时间内可以携带的物资数量。",
	"All three optional rules in the {@variantrule Healing|dmg} entry can be used to adjust the pacing of combat encounters in your game, which in turn influences the number of encounters the party can handle while exploring. In particular, the Healer's Kit Dependency optional rule is a great way to add an additional resource the party must manage during their travels that isn't overbearing to track nor unimportant to have.": "{@variantrule Healing|dmg}条目中的所有三条可选规则都可以用来调整游戏中战斗遭遇的节奏，这反过来又影响了队伍在探索过程中可以处理的遭遇的数量。特别是，\"治疗师工具包依赖性 \"是一种很好的方式，可以为队伍在旅行中增加一种必须管理的额外资源，这种资源既不需要跟踪，也不需要不重要的东西。",
	"The {@variantrule Tool Proficiencies|XGE} expanded rule works well when used during extended periods of downtime, but they can also help to make exploration more fun during the small amount of free time the party gets each day while traveling.": "{@variantrule Tool Proficiencies|XGE}扩展规则在长期停工期间使用时效果很好，但它们也可以帮助在旅行期间党派每天获得的少量空闲时间内使探索变得更加有趣。",
	"The options below are presented as independent fixes for various aspects of the exploration pillar that I find to be lacking. They can be added as a group or individually to your game.": "下面的选项是对我认为缺乏的探索支柱的各个方面的独立修正。它们可以作为一个整体或单独添加到你的游戏中。",
	"Below is a list of spells that are oriented towards or have interactions with exploration and survival based games, which you should keep in mind when designing a campaign and during character creation. You may also wish to restrict, nerf, or outright ban some of these spells in your game, although this is not a requirement by any means.": "下面是一份面向探索和生存游戏或与之有互动关系的法术清单，你在设计战役和创建角色时应该牢记这一点。你也可能希望在你的游戏中限制、削弱或直接禁止其中的一些法术，尽管这并不是什么要求。",
	"1st level: {@spell comprehend languages}, {@spell create or destroy water}, {@spell detect poison and disease}, {@spell goodberry}, {@spell purify food or drink}": "第一层：{@spell comprehend languages}, {@spell create or destroy water}, {@spell detect poison and disease}, {@spell goodberry}, {@spell purify food or drink}",

	"This chapter presents an alternative system for exploration that replaces the existing rules in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}.": "本章提出了一个替代性的探索系统，取代了{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中的现有规则。",
	"Before we dive into the mechanics, let's take a moment to review the context and goals of this exploration system.": "在我们深入了解这些机制之前，让我们花点时间回顾一下这个探索系统的背景和目标。",
	"Based on the discussion in the first chapter, there are three main goals of this system: to be as unintrusive to base 5e as possible, to allow the party to make informed choices, to allow those choices to have a significant impact on the game itself.": "基于第一章的讨论，这个系统有三个主要目标：尽可能不影响基础5e，允许当事人做出明智的选择，允许这些选择对游戏本身产生重大影响。",
	"While the official rules for exploration may be lackluster, it is still a good idea to not deviate too far from them as to minimize the amount of content that is invalidated. Most big rule deviations were put into the Expanded Options chapter, while much of the core system expands on official rules that already exist. In particular, this system refers to the rules for foraging, tracking, and random encounters found in the {@book Player's Handbook|phb} and {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}, rather than attempting to introduce new mechanics where they aren't needed.": "虽然官方的探索规则可能是乏善可陈的，但不要偏离太远，以尽量减少无效的内容，这仍然是一个好主意。大多数大的规则偏离都被放到了扩展选项章节中，而核心系统的大部分内容都是对已经存在的官方规则的扩展。特别是，这个系统参考了（%0%）和（%1%）中的觅食、追踪和随机遭遇的规则，而不是试图在不需要的地方引入新的机制。",
	"This exploration system is designed to be as freeform and flexible as possible. While some activities may provide tables for suggested check DCs, no check requires the use of a specific ability score, skill, or tool. Instead, each activity lists a few suggested skill or tool proficiencies that could apply, while leaving the door open for the players to come up with their own ideas that might warrant some unorthodox checks. This rewards players for their creativity while also allowing the DM to make rulings in even the weirdest of situations.": "这个探索系统被设计成尽可能的自由和灵活。虽然有些活动可能会提供建议的检查DC的表格，但没有检查要求使用特定的能力分数、技能或工具。相反，每项活动都列出了一些可能适用的建议技能或工具的熟练程度，同时为玩家留出大门，让他们提出自己的想法，可能需要一些非正统的检查。这既奖励了玩家的创造力，又允许管理员在最奇怪的情况下做出裁决。",
	"Instead of constant bookkeeping or busywork, this system is designed to create opportunities for informed decisions that the party must make while traveling. In order for such decisions to be informed, they have to receive relevant information beforehand; thus, this system includes multiple travel activities centered around gather information or discovering new things in the environment. The party can then use this information when making decisions on where to go and what paths to take.": "这个系统的设计不是不断地记账或忙碌，而是为当事人在旅行中必须做出的知情决定创造机会。为了使这种决定是知情的，他们必须事先得到相关的信息；因此，这个系统包括以收集信息或发现环境中的新事物为中心的多种旅行活动。然后，在做出去哪里和走什么路的决定时，当事人可以利用这些信息。",
	"Does the party take the shortcut that cuts through the dark forest, despite knowing the monsters that lurk within? Do they go hunting for abandoned ruins, knowing that the region still contains treasure that has been lost for centuries? Do they press onwards into the mountains, despite knowing that food and water are scarce there? Decisions like these are what drive exploration and make for a fun experience for everyone.": "尽管知道黑暗森林中潜伏着怪物，但他们是否会选择穿过黑暗森林的捷径？他们是否会去寻找被遗弃的废墟，尽管知道这个地区仍然有已经丢失了几个世纪的宝藏？尽管知道那里的食物和水都很稀缺，但他们还是要继续向山区前进吗？诸如此类的决定是探索的动力，并为每个人带来有趣的体验。",
	"If the party makes a decision, that decision should have consequences. If just walking around the dark forest took the same amount of time as it would to cut through it, then what's the point of going in? Instead of rolling to not suffer as much, this system rewards characters for their efforts in a variety of ways.": "如果党做出了决定，这个决定应该有后果。如果只是在黑暗的森林里走一圈，所花的时间和切开森林所花的时间一样多，那么进去的意义何在？这个系统不是通过打滚来不吃亏，而是通过各种方式来奖励人物的努力。",
	"To that end, the mechanics for navigating the wilderness and becoming lost have been completely overhauled. Instead of rolling to not get lost all the time, a navigator can instead roll to find shortcuts that cut down on travel time, or to overcome difficult terrain for the day. This rewards the navigator for their efforts while also creating new opportunities for exploration and adventuring.": "为此，荒野导航和迷路的机制已被彻底修改。领航员可以通过翻滚来寻找捷径，以减少旅行时间，或克服当天的困难地形，而不是一直翻滚着不迷路。这在奖励导航员的努力的同时，也为探索和冒险创造了新的机会。",
	"Chosen from among the content discussed earlier, this section lists a few variant and optional rules that have special interactions with the new exploration system presented later in this chapter. Note that most of the rules from the New Content section of the previous chapter are compatible with and are recommended to be used alongside this exploration system.": "本节从前面讨论的内容中选取，列出了一些与本章后面介绍的新探索系统有特殊互动关系的变体和可选规则。请注意，前一章新内容部分的大多数规则都与本探索系统兼容，并建议与本探索系统一起使用。",
	"This system assumes that the Flexible Resting variant presented in the previous section is being used for the purpose of combat and narrative pacing, although not using it won't necessarily break anything.": "这个系统假定上一节介绍的灵活休息变体是为了战斗和叙事节奏的目的而使用的，尽管不使用它也不一定会破坏什么。",
	"The features possessed by the default ranger will invalidate many portions of this system. Please use this variant to prevent that from happening.": "默认游侠所拥有的功能将使这个系统的许多部分失效。请使用这个变体来防止这种情况的发生。",
	"This system works best alongside the {@variantrule Skills with Different Abilities|phb} variant. When a character improvises an activity while exploring, an unorthodox combination of an ability score and skill proficiency created using this variant can be used to resolve it, which encourages the players to use more creativity and improvisation during their travels.": "这个系统与{@variantrule Skills with Different Abilities|phb}变体一起使用效果最好。当一个角色在探索过程中即兴活动时，使用这个变体创造的能力分数和技能熟练度的非正统组合可以用来解决这个问题，这可以鼓励玩家在旅行中使用更多的创造力和即兴活动。",
	"This system works best alongside the rules for {@variantrule Tool Proficiencies|xge} discussed in the previous chapter. While exploring, one of a character's tool proficiencies might apply to the activity they are participating in. This might allow them to make a check using that tool instead of using a normal skill, or it can combine with one of their skill proficiencies as described in the rule entry.": "这个系统与上一章讨论的{@variantrule Tool Proficiencies|xge}的规则一起使用效果最好。在探索过程中，一个角色的工具能力可能适用于他们正在参与的活动。这可能允许他们使用该工具进行检查，而不是使用正常的技能，或者可以与他们的一个技能熟练度结合起来，如规则条目中所述。",
	"This section lists a few essential rules that govern any wilderness environment being traveled through and how it can be interacted with.": "本节列出了一些基本的规则，这些规则制约着正在穿越的任何荒野环境以及如何与之互动。",
	"The party only gets lost while traveling with this system when the DM says so. This usually happens when the party enters a new, unfamiliar region without a map or some other guide, but it can also happen if the party escapes into the wilderness after being captured or otherwise finds themself in a new area without having willingly traveled there. Otherwise, it shouldn't happen too regularly.": "只有在DM说的情况下，队伍才会在使用这个系统旅行时迷路。这通常发生在党派进入一个新的、不熟悉的地区而没有地图或其他指南的情况下，但也可能发生在党派被俘后逃到荒野中，或以其他方式发现自己在一个新的地区而不是自愿前往那里。否则，它不应该经常发生。",
	"While the party is lost, they are unaware of their current location on any map of the region they have. After a day of travel, a lost party might find themselves up to {@dice 2d6} miles away in a random direction from their intended path or destination. To stop being lost, a navigating character can spend a day of travel attempting to regaining their bearings.": "当队伍迷路的时候，他们在他们所拥有的任何地区的地图上都不知道他们当前的位置。经过一天的旅行，迷路的队伍可能会发现自己在一个随机的方向上离他们预定的路径或目的地多达{@dice 2d6}英里远。为了不再迷路，一个导航的角色可以花一天的时间试图重新找回他们的方位。",
	"While traveling using these rules, use the normal guidelines for random encounters found in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}. As an optional rule for when the characters are lost, roll twice for each random encounter check to reflect that the characters might blunder into a monster lair or other unusual threat.": "在使用这些规则旅行时，请使用在（%0%）中发现的关于随机遭遇的正常准则。作为一条可选的规则，当角色迷路时，为每个随机遭遇检查掷两次，以反映角色可能误入怪物巢穴或其他不寻常的威胁。",
	"Additonally, consider rolling for random encounters ahead of time, rather than mid-session. You can also forgo random rolls and encounter tables altogether in favor of custom encounters that you create by hand.": "另外，考虑提前滚动随机遭遇，而不是在会话中。你也可以完全放弃随机卷和奇遇表，而采用你亲手创建的自定义奇遇。",
	"This exploration system is built to support hexcrawl games, as detailed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}.": "这个探索系统是为了支持hexcrawl游戏而建立的，详见（%0%）。",
	"The daily travel paces for this system are designed to work with a kingdom-scale map (1 hex = 6 miles). As the party travels through each of these hexes, describe the terrain obstacles and features they face, as well as the general ambiance and mood of the region. While not all hexes have to have interesting creatures, locations, or hazards (as discussed later in this chapter), ensure that each hex has at least one feature or descriptor that you can use to make it stand out from the rest.": "这个系统的日常旅行步调是为了配合王国规模的地图（1个六角星=6英里）。当党派在这些六边形地区旅行时，描述他们面临的地形障碍和特征，以及该地区的总体氛围和情绪。虽然不是所有的六角星都必须有有趣的生物、地点或危险（正如本章后面所讨论的），但要确保每个六角星至少有一个特征或描述词，你可以用它来使它在其他地方脱颖而出。",
	"To resolve travel over a \"half hex\", roll a {@dice d4}. On a roll of 3 or 4, the party advances 1 additional hex. On a roll of 1 or 2, the party stays in their current hex.": "为了解决在 \"半个六角 \"上的旅行问题，请掷出{@dice d4}。在掷出3或4的时候，队伍会额外前进一个六角。在掷出1或2的时候，队伍就会停留在他们当前的爻位。",
	"The hourly travel paces for this system are designed to work with a province-scale map (1 hex = 1 mile). Consider using this scale to \"zoom in\" whenever the party takes their time to explore a specific area of interest, such as an abandoned settlement or the immediate area surrounding a monster lair. If the area isn't large enough to span more than a few of these hexes, consider zooming in further and using a minute-based travel pace.": "本系统的每小时旅行步数是为配合全省范围的地图而设计的（1六角=1英里）。考虑使用这个比例尺来 \"放大\"，每当党派花时间探索一个感兴趣的特定区域时，例如一个被遗弃的定居点或一个怪物巢穴周围的直接区域。如果该地区不够大，不能跨越几个这样的六边形，可以考虑进一步放大并使用基于分钟的旅行速度。",
	"These rules break overland travel down into four different phases.": "这些规则将陆路旅行分为四个不同阶段。",
	"Establish Goals": "确立目标",
	"Choose activities": "选择活动",
	"Resolve activities and travel": "解决活动和旅行问题",
	"Before the party begins traveling for the day, the players must choose where they want to go. They might have a specific location in mind, or they could just be wandering in a particular direction. Either way, they should decide which direction they want to travel in before the day starts.": "在队伍开始一天的旅行之前，玩家必须选择他们想去的地方。他们可能有一个特定的地点，也可能只是在一个特定的方向徘徊。无论是哪种情况，他们都应该在一天开始前决定自己要去的方向。",
	"During this phase, you should also take the time to establish what general goals the party might have for the day. They might lean towards being very cautious, or perhaps they are rushing for time. They might be in a mood for some combat, or maybe they are instead looking to find some cool treasure. By establishing these general goals, you can ensure that the players remain engaged and focused, and you can also adjust your plans accordingly.": "在这个阶段，你还应该花时间确定当事人当天可能有哪些总体目标。他们可能倾向于非常谨慎，也可能在赶时间。他们可能有心情进行战斗，也可能是想寻找一些很酷的宝藏。通过建立这些一般目标，你可以确保玩家保持参与和专注，你也可以相应地调整你的计划。",
	"You can use the travel pace rules detailed in the {@book Player's Handbook|phb} to represent travel across established roads and other relatively civilized areas. However, travel through the wilderness is often inefficient and indirect, even if difficult terrain isn't widespread. To represent this, use the travel pace tables below while in a wilderness environmnet. The first one represents the rate of travel in a normal wilderness environment, while the second one represents the rate of travel in a wilderness environment that is particularly difficult to navigate.": "你可以使用{@book Player's Handbook|phb}中详述的旅行速度规则来表示穿越既定道路和其他相对文明地区的旅行。然而，在荒野中的旅行往往是低效和间接的，即使困难地形并不普遍。为了表示这一点，在荒野环境中，使用下面的旅行速度表。第一个代表正常荒野环境中的旅行速度，第二个代表在特别难走的荒野环境中的旅行速度。",
	"Note that the tables below, as well as the one presented in the {@book Player's Handbook|phb}, use distances that are rounded to nice numbers. While this may cause them to be slightly inaccurate, the rounding here makes these values much easier to use in play. To avoid these inaccuracies from bogging down your game, consider only focusing on the Distance Traveled per Day column of each table as much as possible.": "请注意，下面的表格，以及{@book Player's Handbook|phb}中提出的表格，使用的距离是四舍五入的好数字。虽然这可能导致它们略微不准确，但这里的四舍五入使这些数值更容易在游戏中使用。为了避免这些不准确的东西使你的游戏陷入困境，考虑尽可能只关注每个表格中的每天行驶的距离栏。",

	"Each character can perform one activity while traveling, chosen from the options below. Note that each activity lacks a specific check that is associated with it; rather, each activity lists example skills and tools that could be used for the check, as per the character's specific actions and your judgement as the DM. Additionally, note that two or more characters can only participate in the same activity if they all choose different sub-activities to partake in.": "每个角色在旅行时可以进行一项活动，从下面的选项中选择。请注意，每项活动都没有与之相关的具体检查；相反，每项活动都列出了可用于检查的技能和工具的例子，根据角色的具体行动和你作为DM的判断。此外，请注意，两个或更多的角色只有在选择不同的子活动时才能参加同一活动。",
	"This activity covers improving the party's morale, organizing the party's equipment and other items, tending to each party member's wounds, or otherwise bolstering its existing efforts.": "这项活动包括提高党的士气，组织党的装备和其他物品，照顾每个党员的伤口，或以其他方式支持党的现有努力。",
	"Whenever the party makes a saving throw against disease or {@condition exhaustion}, the bolstering character can make an appropriate check against the same DC as the effect. On a success, the party gains advantage on the saving throw.": "无论什么时候，当一方对疾病或{@condition exhaustion}进行救赎时，支持的角色可以对与该效果相同的DC进行适当的检查。如果成功，该方在救赎动作上获得优势。",
	"This activity covers gathering food and water from the surrounding wilderness. It uses the same foraging rules as those described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}, but expands it to allow for more than just Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks.": "这项活动包括从周围的荒野中收集食物和水。它使用与{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中描述的相同的觅食规则，但将其扩展到允许不仅仅是智慧({@skill Survival})检查。",
	"A foraging character makes an appropriate check as the party travels at a normal or slow pace, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region.": "当队伍以正常或缓慢的速度行进时，一个觅食的角色会进行适当的检查，检查值由该地区的食物和水的丰富程度决定。",
	"Abundant food and water sources": "丰富的食物和水源",
	"Limited food and water sources": "食物和水的来源有限",
	"Very little, if any, food and water sources": "很少，如果有的话，食物和水的来源",
	"If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, roll {@dice 1d6} + the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in gallons).": "如果有多个角色进行觅食，每个角色都要进行单独检查。如果检查失败，一个觅食的角色将一无所获。在检查成功时，掷出{@dice 1d6}+该角色的智慧修改器，以确定该角色找到多少食物（磅），然后重复掷出水（加仑）。",
	"This activity covers research and examination of the region the party is traveling in as a way to acquire detailed information about its inhabitants, its historical or religious importance, or any notable locations of interest within it.": "这项活动包括对旅行地区的研究和考察，以获得有关该地区居民、历史或宗教重要性，或其中任何值得注意的地点的详细信息。",
	"A character that is gathering information makes an appropriate check twice per day: once after four hours of travel, and again after eight hours of travel. You may gate certain information behind a set DC, or you can simply scale the amount of information gathered according to the result of the check.": "一个正在收集信息的角色每天要进行两次适当的检查：一次在旅行四小时后，另一次在旅行八小时后。你可以将某些信息关在一个设定的DC后面，或者你可以简单地根据检查的结果来调整收集的信息量。",
	"Information gathered from this activity might aid in the other characters' activities, perhaps even decreasing the DC of the ability checks made for them. For example, if a character that gathers information learns of a nearby religious monument, the scout of the party might have an easier time locating it. More information on the order activities are resolved in is provided in the next section.": "从这项活动中收集到的信息可能有助于其他角色的活动，甚至可能减少对他们进行能力检查的DC。例如，如果一个收集信息的角色了解到附近有一个宗教纪念碑，那么队伍中的侦察员可能会更容易找到它。更多关于活动解决顺序的信息将在下一节中提供。",
	"This activity covers various courses of action involving the party's travel time and the path they take to get to their destination. The navigator can choose from one of the sub-activities detailed below.": "这项活动涵盖了各种行动方案，涉及到当事人的旅行时间和他们到达目的地的路径。导航员可以从下面详述的子活动中选择一个。",
	"If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a fast pace imposes a -5 penalty. If the party has an accurate map of the region or can see the sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check.": "如果队伍以缓慢的速度前进，领航员在检查中获得+5的奖励，而快速的速度则会带来-5的惩罚。如果一行人有该地区的精确地图，或者能看到太阳或星星，领航员在检查中具有优势。",
	"In the wilderness, travel is rarely direct. Even when there isn't difficult terrain, travelers are bound to encounter natural barriers, winding and inefficient paths, and other obstacles that prevent them from getting to their destination as quickly as they'd like. To compensate, the navigator of the party can attempt to find shortcuts that cut down on their travel time. The navigator makes an appropriate check against a DC determined by the nature of the shortcut, as shown on the  Shortcut DCs table below. On a success, the party party finds one or more shortcuts that allow them to traverse an additional 6 miles over the course of the day. In environments where travel paces are even slower than that of difficult terrain, shortcuts instead amount to two hours worth of extra traveling.": "在荒野中，旅行很少是直接的。即使没有困难的地形，旅行者也一定会遇到自然障碍、曲折低效的道路和其他障碍，使他们无法如愿以偿地到达目的地。为了弥补这一点，队伍中的领航员可以尝试寻找捷径，减少他们的旅行时间。领航员根据捷径的性质进行适当的检定，如下面的捷径DCs表所示。如果成功，一行人就能找到一条或多条捷径，使他们在一天内多走6英里。在旅行速度比困难地形还要慢的环境中，捷径反而相当于两个小时的额外旅行。",
	"When the party finds one or more shortcuts, note that these alternative paths are a perfect opportunity for excitement and adventure. Perhaps a given shortcut might pass through territory controlled by hostile creatures, or maybe the shortcut is a dungeon of sorts that the party must fight their way out of. Note that if the party believes the risk to be too high, they can always opt to not take any shortcuts for the day.": "当党派发现一条或多条捷径时，注意这些替代路径是刺激和冒险的绝佳机会。也许某条捷径可能会通过被敌对生物控制的领土，或者捷径是一个地牢，党派必须从那里打出一条路。请注意，如果党派认为风险太高，他们总是可以选择在一天内不走任何捷径。",

	"Shortcut is hidden using powerful magic, such as a regional effect that causes a forest's trees to slowly shift and force characters onto the wrong path": "捷径是利用强大的魔法隐藏起来的，比如一个区域性的效果，使森林的树木慢慢转变，迫使人物走上错误的道路。",
	"While obstacles like mud, snow, and ice are usually a significant impedement for travelers, it's possible for a competent navigator to overcome them. The navigator makes an appropriate check against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as shown on the Overcoming Difficult Terrain DCs table below. On a success, difficult terrain doesn't slow the party's travel for the day.": "虽然像泥地、雪地和冰地这样的障碍物通常对旅行者来说是一个很大的阻碍，但是一个合格的领航员还是有可能克服它们。领航员根据当时的地形决定的DC进行适当的检查，如下面的克服困难地形DCs表所示。如果成功，困难的地形就不会拖累队伍当天的行程。",
	"In environments where travel paces are even slower than that of difficult terrain, the speed the party can travel at doubles on a success.": "在行进速度比困难地形还要慢的环境中，成功后队伍的行进速度会加倍。",
	"Difficult terrain is created by magic or some other supernatural force": "困难的地形是由魔法或其他超自然的力量造成的",
	"Difficult terrain consists of significant hazards such as dense trees, rocky mountains, or turbulent waters": "困难的地形包括重要的危险，如茂密的树木、岩石山或湍急的水域",
	"Difficult terrain consists of more forgiving hazards such as lighter forests and layers of snow": "困难的地形包括更宽容的危险，如较轻的森林和雪层",
	"If the party is lost, the navigator can attempt to regain their bearings. The navigator makes an appropriate check against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as shown on the Regaining Bearings DCs table below. On a success, the party is no longer lost.": "如果队伍迷路了，领航员可以尝试重新获得他们的方位。领航员根据当时的地形决定的DC进行适当的检查，如下面的重获方位DCs表所示。一旦成功，队伍就不再迷路。",
	"Forest, jungle, swamp, mountains, or open sea with overcast skies and no land in sight": "森林、丛林、沼泽、山脉，或天空阴沉、看不到陆地的开阔海域",

	"Grassland, meadow, farmland": "草地、草场、农田",
	"This activity covers keeping watch for threats, whether they are creatures or natural hazards, while traveling. A character that keeps watch makes an appropriate check whenever you call for it, with disadvantage if the party is traveling at a fast pace. Note that passive {@skill Perception} scores aren't used while traveling with these rules.": "这个活动涵盖了在旅行中保持对威胁的警惕，不管是生物还是自然危害。每当你要求时，保持警惕的角色就会进行适当的检查，如果队伍在快速旅行，则会有不利因素。请注意，在使用这些规则旅行时，不使用被动（%0%）得分。",
	"What the character notices with their check depends on the nature of the potential threat and how hard it is to spot. For example, the DC to notice a creature depends on how well it is hiding, while the DC to notice a wilderness hazard depends on how easy it is to see within the surrounding terrain. The sections below discuss possible threats that can be identified by a character that keeps watch.": "角色通过检查注意到什么，取决于潜在威胁的性质和发现它的难度。例如，注意一个生物的DC取决于它的隐藏程度，而注意一个荒野危险的DC则取决于在周围地形中看到它的容易程度。下面的章节讨论了守望的角色可以识别的可能的威胁。",
	"While noticing creatures that aren't moving stealthily requires no check, creatures that are moving stealthily are much harder to notice. Such creatures can be spotted by using various senses to notice their presence, or they can be noticed indirectly via signs of their influence on the surrounding ecosystem. Spotting a hidden creature ahead of time might prevent the party from being ambushed by it, which would cause them to be surprised when combat erupts.": "虽然注意到没有隐秘移动的生物不需要检查，但隐秘移动的生物则更难注意。这种生物可以通过使用各种感官来发现它们的存在，也可以通过它们对周围生态系统的影响的迹象来间接注意到它们。提前发现隐秘的生物可能会阻止党派被它伏击，这将导致他们在战斗爆发时感到惊讶。",
	"While hazards like {@hazard razorvine} and {@hazard slippery ice} can be spotted without a check, {@hazard quicksand}, {@hazard thin ice}, and other hazards might be harder to spot or to identify for what they are. Spotting a wilderness hazard ahead of time might prevent the party from accidentally falling victim to it.": "虽然像{@hazard razorvine}和{@hazard slippery ice}这样的危险不需要检查就能发现，但{@hazard quicksand}、{@hazard thin ice}和其他危险可能更难发现或识别它们是什么。提前发现荒野的危险，可以防止队伍意外地成为它的受害者。",
	"This activity covers scouting out the area near the party as it travels in order to find new locations and other interesting things.": "这项活动包括在队伍旅行时侦察附近的地区，以便找到新的地点和其他有趣的东西。",
	"For the purpose of keeping the game simple and fair, you can consider a scouting character to be alongside the rest of the party whenever a combat encounter occurs.": "为了保持游戏的简单和公平，你可以认为只要发生战斗遭遇，侦查角色就会和其他队员在一起。",
	"A location of interest could be an abandoned settlement, a dungeon entrance, or some other adventuring site, but it could also be an otherwise indistinct place where monsters are currently stationed in. To look for potential locations of interest, a scouting character makes an appropriate check whenever you call for it, with disadvantage if the party is traveling at a fast pace. The DC of the check is determined by the Discovery DCs table below (which is a repurposed version of the Finding Shortcut DCs table earlier in this chapter). On a success, the scout identifies the location of interest, and the party can choose to stop and explore it if they'd like.": "一个感兴趣的地点可以是一个被遗弃的定居点、一个地牢的入口或者其他的冒险地点，但它也可以是一个目前有怪物驻扎的、不明确的地方。为了寻找潜在的感兴趣的地点，只要你要求，侦察员就会进行适当的检查，如果队伍正在快速行进，则为不利。检查的DC由下面的发现DCs表决定（该表是本章前面的寻找捷径DCs表的再利用版本）。如果成功，侦察员就能确定感兴趣的地点，如果他们愿意的话，可以选择停下来探索它。",
	"Remember that withholding opportunities for adventuring isn't fun for the party. While active scouting should be rewarded on a success, the party should still be provided with interesting locations to explore even if they don't have a scout.": "请记住，扣留冒险的机会对队伍来说并不有趣。虽然积极的侦察工作应该在成功后得到奖励，但即使没有侦察员，也应该为党派提供有趣的探索地点。",
	"Location has a clear road, trail, or well-marked path leading to it": "地点有明确的道路、小径或有明确标志的小路通向它",

	"Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following the tracks of other creatures—or other creatures might track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures must succeed on an appropriate check. You might require trackers to make a new check in any of the following circumstances:": "冒险家们有时会通过追踪其他生物的足迹来选择自己的道路，或者其他生物可能会追踪冒险家！要想追踪，必须有一个或多个生物成功地进行适当的检查。为了追踪，一个或多个生物必须成功地进行适当的检查。你可以要求追踪者在以下任何一种情况下进行新的检查。",
	"They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short or long rest.": "他们停止跟踪，在完成短暂或长时间的休息后恢复。",
	"The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that shows no tracks.": "小路穿过一个障碍物，如河流，但没有显示任何足迹。",
	"The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes tracking harder.": "天气条件或地形的变化使追踪变得更加困难。",
	"The DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is impossible. The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check if there's more than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being followed passes through a well-trafficked area.": "检查的DC取决于地面上的生物通过的痕迹有多大。在足迹明显的情况下，不需要进行检定。例如，追踪一支在泥泞道路上前进的军队就不需要检查。在光秃秃的石头地面上发现足迹则更具挑战性，除非被追踪的生物留下明显的痕迹。此外，时间的流逝往往使足迹更难追踪。在没有痕迹可循的情况下，你可以判定追踪是不可能的。追踪DCs表提供了设置DC的指南，或者，如果你愿意，你可以根据你对难度的评估选择一个DC。如果有一组以上的足迹可供追踪，你也可以在检查中给予优势，如果被追踪的足迹经过了一个人迹罕至的地区，则给予劣势。",
	"On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.": "如果检查失败，角色就会失去踪迹，但可以通过对该地区进行仔细的搜索来试图再次找到它。在一个封闭的区域（如地牢）寻找线索需要10分钟，在户外则需要1小时。",
	"Soft surface such as snow": "软表面，如雪",

	"This section lists a few other miscellaenous activities that a character can choose from.": "本节列出了角色可以选择的其他一些混杂的活动。",
	"The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost (no ability check). This can be done alongside a second activity if the character is proficient in cartographer's tools and uses them to draw the map.": "角色可以画一张地图，记录小组的进展，并在他们迷路时帮助他们回到原路（无需检查能力）。如果该人物精通制图工具并使用它们来绘制地图，那么这可以与第二个活动同时进行。",
	"While many of these activities already allow tool proficiencies to be used alongside them, a character can also use their tools in other ways as described in the {@variantrule Tool Proficiencies|xge} entry. As most tool usage requires or is best done when stationary, treat a day travel as only being equivalent to a short rest for the purpose of resolving each tool's special uses.": "虽然这些活动中有许多已经允许工具的熟练度与之一起使用，但角色也可以用其他方式使用他们的工具，如{@variantrule Tool Proficiencies|xge}条目中所述。由于大多数工具的使用都需要或最好在静止状态下进行，因此在解决每个工具的特殊用途时，将一天的旅行视为只相当于一个短暂的休息。",
	"While the entries listed in this document already cover most possible activities while traveling, it is still possible for a character to perform some other activity that isn't listed here. To resolve such an activity, choose an appropriate check for the character to make, and come up with a contest or set DC to determine whether or not they succeed. Model the DCs and results of that activity off of the ones listed in this document when possible.": "虽然本文列出的条目已经涵盖了旅行中大多数可能的活动，但角色仍有可能进行一些其他未在此列出的活动。为了解决这样的活动，要为角色选择一个适当的检查，并想出一个竞赛或设定的DC来决定他们是否成功。在可能的情况下，该活动的DC和结果应以本文中所列的活动为模型。",
	"Once every character has chosen an activity, their travels for the day can be resolved.": "一旦每个角色选择了一项活动，他们一天的旅行就可以得到解决。",
	"Activities are resolved in chronological order as the day goes on. If an activity lets a character make multiple checks depending on the circumstances, they will generally be resolved over the course of the day as they come up. If an activity only has a character make one check, have them roll it earlier in the day, but try to have the results of that activity play out over the entire day.": "在一天中，活动是按时间顺序解决的。如果一项活动让一个角色根据情况进行多次检查，那么它们通常会在一天中出现时得到解决。如果一项活动只让一个角色做一次检查，让他们在一天的早些时候进行检查，但尽量让这项活动的结果在一整天内发挥出来。",
	"At your discretion, you can allow the results of an activity to influence the check DCs of any of the others. For example, if a character that Gathers Information learns about a historical monument in the region, it might be easier for another character that is Scouting to discover it. When adjusting the DC of a check in this manner, you should do so in increments of 2 in minor cases, and in increments of 5 in major ones.": "根据你的判断，你可以让一项活动的结果影响其他任何活动的检查DC。例如，如果一个收集信息的角色了解到该地区的一个历史遗迹，那么另一个正在侦察的角色可能会更容易发现它。当以这种方式调整检查DC时，在小的情况下，你应该以2为增量，在大的情况下以5为增量。",
	"As circumstances change, a character may wish to swap from one activity to another. For instance, a character that is foraging may wish to start tracking instead once they discover abnormally large footprints that could lead to a monster lair. How to handle this shift depends on what activities are being switched between and how often checks for them are called for.": "随着情况的变化，一个角色可能希望从一个活动换到另一个活动。例如，一个正在觅食的角色一旦发现有可能通往怪物巢穴的异常大的脚印，就可能希望转而开始追踪。如何处理这种转变取决于在各种活动之间的转换，以及需要对它们进行检查的频率。",
	"Activities like Noticing Threats and Tracking can be switched between seemlessly without any additional rulings, as checks for them are made throughout the day whenever the DM calls for them. However, switching to activities like Foraging and Gathering Information that only have checks once or twice requires more care, and should generally only be allowed halfway through the day.": "像注意威胁和追踪这样的活动，可以在没有任何额外规则的情况下随意切换，因为只要DM要求，就会在一天中对它们进行检查。然而，切换到像觅食和收集信息这样只有一两次检查的活动，则需要更多的小心，一般只允许在一天的中途进行。",
	"If a character switches to an activity like Foraging, consider imposing disadvantage or a -5 penalty on their check made to do so, or perhaps halve the benefits yielded from a success (e.g. for Foraging, halve the amount of food acquired). For an activity like Gathering Information that normally has you make two checks per day, allow only one check instead.": "如果一个角色转向像觅食这样的活动，可以考虑对他们的检查施加劣势或-5的惩罚，或者也许将成功后的收益减半（例如对于觅食，获得的食物数量减半）。对于像收集信息这样的活动，通常你每天要做两次检查，那么只允许做一次检查。",
	"In general, try to avoid allowing the players to change their activities during the day too often. While such switches make sense when circumstances change or new information is acquired, remember that unnecessary switching can be used in bad faith as a way to powergame the system and can drastically slow down the game in the process.": "一般来说，尽量避免让玩家在一天中过于频繁地改变他们的活动。虽然在情况发生变化或获得新信息时，这样的切换是有意义的，但请记住，不必要的切换可能被恶意利用，作为一种玩弄系统的方式，并在这个过程中大幅降低游戏的速度。",
	"After determining if a group becomes lost or has a random encounter, check your map to determine the party's route during the day. From their starting location, track how far they travel toward their destination. Narrate any changes in terrain or any special locations the characters find along the way, resolving encounters as needed.": "在确定一个团体是否迷路或有随机遭遇后，检查你的地图以确定该团体在白天的路线。从他们的出发地开始，追踪他们向目的地走了多远。叙述沿途的地形变化或人物发现的任何特殊地点，根据需要解决遭遇战。",
	"The party should have at least one creature encounter per day of travel. While not all encounters have to be resolved using combat, you can ensure the party remains properly challenged by aiming to have at least one combat encounter and a few other non-combat encounters each day.": "队伍在旅行的每一天都应该有至少一次生物遭遇战。虽然不是所有的遭遇都必须用战斗来解决，但你可以通过争取每天至少有一次战斗遭遇和其他一些非战斗遭遇来确保队伍保持适当的挑战。",
	"The party should have to face at least one wilderness hazard or obstacle per day of travel. This hazard can take the form of a mountain range that blocks direct passage, a snowstorm that causes heavy precipitation and extreme cold, or some other obstacle that could impede the party's travel or threaten their safety.": "队伍在每天的旅行中应该至少要面对一个野外的危险或障碍。这种危险的形式可以是阻挡直接通道的山脉，造成大量降水和极度寒冷的暴风雪，或者其他一些可能阻碍队伍旅行或威胁其安全的障碍。",
	"The party should discover at least one location of interest per day of travel. For each character in the party that is navigating or scouting, add more possible locations for them to discover on a successful check. Since not all locations will require a full day to fully explore, be sure to add enough locations of interest to maintain variety and engagement as the party travels.": "队伍在每一天的旅行中应该至少发现一个感兴趣的地点。对于队伍中每一个正在航行或侦查的角色，在成功检查后为他们增加更多可能的地点。由于并不是所有的地点都需要一整天的时间来完全探索，所以一定要增加足够多的感兴趣的地点，以保持队伍旅行时的多样性和参与性。",
	"Whenever an event occurs while traveling, consider tying that event to one of the characters' activities. For example, if a scouting character rolls high on their check, allow them to be the one to discover the monster lair or dungeon you already had planned. By delivering events through the characters' activities, you are rewarding them for using their agency to make certain choices and putting effort into succeeding at them.": "每当旅行中发生事件时，考虑将该事件与某个角色的活动联系起来。例如，如果侦察员的检查结果很高，就允许他们去发现你已经计划好的怪物巢穴或地牢。通过角色的活动来传递事件，你是在奖励他们利用自己的力量做出某些选择，并为成功做出努力。",
	"After traveling for the day, the characters must find or create an appropriate shelter to spend the night in. Such a shelter must be able to protect the characters from extreme temperatures, precipitation and other weather phenomena, and any other forces of nature so that a proper rest can be taken.": "在旅行了一天之后，人物必须找到或创造一个适当的庇护所来过夜。这样的庇护所必须能够保护人物免受极端温度、降水和其他天气现象以及任何其他自然力量的影响，以便能够适当休息。",
	"You can have them find pre-existing shelter through the activities they did during the day. For example, a foraging character could stumble upon a cave inhabited by wolves that can be used as shelter once cleared. Alternatively, the party could use the equipment they already have to create their own shelter. If finding or making shelter is particularly difficult in certain circumstances, you could require the characters to make an appropriate group check. On a failure, the party might have to endure a forced march as they search for a good place to camp.": "你可以让他们通过白天的活动找到预先存在的住所。例如，一个觅食的角色可以偶然发现一个狼群居住的洞穴，一旦被清理出来，就可以作为庇护所使用。另外，他们也可以用自己已有的设备来创造自己的庇护所。如果在某些情况下寻找或制造庇护所特别困难，你可以要求人物进行适当的团体检查。如果失败了，他们可能不得不在寻找一个好地方扎营的过程中忍受强迫行军。",
	"Once the party camps for the night, they generally have about 2 hours of free time, assuming they were able to find shelter without a hitch. Characters can spend this time socializing, discussing the events of the day and planning for the activities of the next day, using their tools and equipment, and so on.": "一旦队伍扎营过夜，他们通常有大约2个小时的自由时间，假设他们能够顺利找到住所。角色们可以利用这段时间进行社交活动，讨论当天的事件，计划第二天的活动，使用他们的工具和设备，等等。",
	"If a creature encounter or some other event occurs during the night, choose a random party member to be on watch as it happens. Use their passive {@skill Perception} score to determine whether or not they notice what is going on.": "如果在夜间发生生物遭遇战或其他事件，随机选择一名党员在事件发生时进行监视。用他们的被动得分（%0%）来决定他们是否注意到发生的事情。",
	"A fun exploration game needs two things: engaging rules for interacting with the exploration pillar, and interesting locations and discoveries to find while exploring. This chapter will present guidelines that allow you to expand upon the latter.": "一个有趣的探索游戏需要两样东西：与探索支柱互动的引人入胜的规则，以及在探索中发现的有趣地点和发现。本章将介绍允许你扩展后者的准则。",
	"In the same way that a map and an encounter key describe a dungeon, the wilderness can be summarized with a hex map and a collection of interesting features.": "就像地图和奇遇钥匙描述一个地下城一样，荒野也可以用一张六边形地图和一个有趣的特征集合来概括。",
	"The guidance given for wilderness mapping in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg} applies to these rules, with one potential exception. It's a good idea to map out an area that a party can cover in a day or two of travel, to allow your design to bring out the details that make each area unique. When creating a wilderness, take the time to think about the mood of an area. Is it a hot, oppressive desert? Is it a terrifying realm of craggy peaks and rivers of lava, with a massive fortress-spire built by a god of war looming over the landscape?": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中给出的荒野制图指导适用于这些规则，但有一个潜在的例外。绘制一个队伍在一两天内就能走完的区域是个好主意，这样可以让你的设计带出使每个区域独特的细节。在创造一个荒野时，花点时间考虑一个地区的气氛。它是一个炎热、压抑的沙漠吗？它是一个由陡峭的山峰和熔岩河组成的可怕的领域，一个由战神建造的巨大的堡垒--火焰笼罩着这片土地？",
	"Take time to also think about what creatures are active in the wilderness, and why. Are the characters moving through a war-torn land, with orc patrols harassing the characters? Do hobgoblin legions struggle to tame a wild frontier, building defensive points to help claim it? Are there legendary, deadly monsters that hunt in this region?": "花点时间想一想，哪些生物在荒野中活动，以及为什么。角色们是否正在穿越一片被战争蹂躏的土地，有兽人巡逻队在骚扰角色们？妖精军团是否在努力驯服一个荒芜的边疆，建立防御点来帮助夺取它？是否有传说中的、致命的怪物在这个地区狩猎？",
	"Pay special attention to friendly settlements and roads. The ease of movement roads provide and the promise of a safe haven make welltraveled and settled areas attractive to most characters—especially low-level characters.": "要特别注意友好的定居点和道路。道路提供的行动便利和安全避难所的承诺，使得交通便利和定居的地区对大多数角色--尤其是低级角色--具有吸引力。",
	"Consider each of the potential adventure locations on your map, and assign discovery DCs to them as appropriate. Take into account the creatures that dwell nearby, a site's notoriety, the presence of any paths or roads leading there, and so forth.": "考虑你地图上的每一个潜在的冒险地点，并根据情况给它们分配发现DC。考虑到附近居住的生物、一个地点的恶名、是否有任何路径或道路通往那里，等等。",
	"Review the monsters that lair in your wilderness, and determine if any exert regional effects that you need to account for. Regional effects (described in the {@i Monster Manual}) are a great tool for showing the players how the presence of a powerful creature can alter the environment. They also add an element of magic and strangeness to areas that might otherwise seem mundane.": "审视在你的荒野中筑巢的怪物，并确定是否有你需要考虑的区域效应。区域效应（在{@i Monster Manual}中描述）是向玩家展示强大生物的存在如何改变环境的一个重要工具。它们还可以为那些原本看起来平凡无奇的地区添加神奇和奇怪的元素。",
	"Take note of the typical DCs for the usual activities that take place while traveling. But also think about DCs for any other ability checks that you feel are relevant for the region. An ability check you call for might be part of an existing activity, it might require a special activity relevant to an area, or it might be a check you ask for only as appropriate. In any case, asking for special checks can help drive home a region's unique character and dangers.": "记下旅行中通常活动的典型DC。但也要考虑你认为与该地区相关的任何其他能力检查的DC。你要求的能力检查可能是现有活动的一部分，可能需要与某一地区相关的特殊活动，也可能是你只要求适当的检查。在任何情况下，要求进行特殊的检查都可以帮助宣传一个地区的独特特征和危险。",
	"As a final useful tool, consider creating a quick table to help you generate terrain for random encounters, or for other events that require a more detailed view as the characters explore. A random table filled with iconic terrain for an area can help inspire you in the moment, and ensures that the interesting key elements of a region remain part of the action.": "作为最后一个有用的工具，考虑创建一个快速表，以帮助你为随机遭遇生成地形，或为其他需要在角色探索时提供更详细视图的事件生成地形。一个随机表充满了一个地区的标志性地形，可以帮助你在当下激发灵感，并确保一个地区的有趣的关键元素仍然是行动的一部分。",
	"Start off with at least one or two noteworthy features that are always present. Then think of a few simple but distinctive features that you'd expect to find in specific areas. If flat grasslands are a dominant feature, you might also have low hills, ruins, watering holes, thorny bushes, and other less common features to break things up.": "首先，至少要有一到两个值得注意的特征，这些特征总是存在的。然后想一些简单但有特色的特征，你希望在特定区域找到这些特征。如果平坦的草地是一个主要特征，你可能还会有低矮的山丘、废墟、水坑、带刺的灌木和其他不太常见的特征来打破局面。",
	"Once you are done, create a list of all your terrain features and assign each one a percentage chance to be present in an area (including 100 percent for dominant features). Then when you need to create an encounter area quickly, you can roll for each feature to see if it is present—thinking of these key features as tactical features that can have an impact on the encounter.": "一旦你完成了这些工作，就把你所有的地形特征列出来，并给每个特征分配一个出现在某个区域的百分比机会（包括100%的主要特征）。然后，当你需要快速创建一个遭遇战区域时，你可以对每一个特征进行滚动，看看它是否存在--把这些关键特征看作是对遭遇战有影响的战术性特征。",
	"This section elaborates on the official guidelines for what can be found on a typical wilderness map (DMG 108).": "本节详细阐述了典型荒野地图上可以找到的内容的官方指南（DMG 108）。",
	"The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg} provides guidelines for creating 50-mile regions of wilderness. To create even larger regions, you can tile multiple 50-mile regions together. For example, a 200-mile region can be made using a 4×4 grid of 50-mile subregions, while a 500-mile region can be made using a 10×10 grid. Each sub-region can be made using the guidelines in the DMG, with a few exceptions noted in the sections below.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}提供了创建50英里荒野区域的指南。为了创建更大的区域，你可以把多个50英里的区域拼在一起。例如，一个200英里的区域可以用一个4×4的50英里子区域网格来制作，而一个500英里的区域可以用一个10×10的网格来制作。每个子区域都可以使用DMG中的指南来制作，但在下面的章节中指出了一些例外情况。",
	"One important factor that determines the inhabitants and ongoings of a region is its biome. A region's biome is a label that describes the general type of climate and ecosystem contained within it. Two types of biomes are discussed below.": "决定一个地区的居民和发展的一个重要因素是其生物群落。一个地区的生物群落是一个标签，描述了它所包含的气候和生态系统的一般类型。下面将讨论两种类型的生物群落。",

	"A {@b supernatural biome} is a biome that can't be found in the real world, such as a forest of giant mushrooms, a wasteland corrupted by necromancy magic, or an entire mountain that hovers above the clouds. As these biomes are more fantastical and awe-inspiring than normal biomes, you are encouraged to use them sparingly.": "{@b supernatural biome}是一种在现实世界中找不到的生物群落，比如巨大的蘑菇森林，被死灵魔法腐蚀的荒地，或者整座悬浮在云层之上的山。由于这些生物群落比普通的生物群落更具有幻想性和威慑力，因此鼓励你少用它们。",
