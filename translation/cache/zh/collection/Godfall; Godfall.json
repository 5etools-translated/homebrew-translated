Were you assigned to a batallion along the outer walls, defending the city from Maelstrom-born horrors alongside the Wardens? Or did you work as part of a clean-up crew duty in the Dead Ward, rebuild damaged city buildings, or some other type of duties? At this point, you�ve been reassigned to finish out the rest of your sentence in the frontier as a conscript adventurer.

What are your plans for when your life is your own again?": "在索拉斯被判定有罪，你被判处将你的生命中的一年时间用于改善这个城市和改善市民的生活。这个惩罚是通过geas咒语实施的，最初可能采取手工或武术劳动的形式，这取决于你的角色的天赋、技能和经验。你是否被分配到外墙的一个小队，与守护者一起保卫城市不受来自漩涡的恐怖影响？或者你是作为清洁队的一部分在死亡区工作，重建受损的城市建筑，或者其他类型的职责？在这一点上，你已经被重新分配到边疆作为一个应征的冒险者来完成你剩余的刑期。这是你必须争取的，还是城市官员强加的另一个不必要的负担？你的罪行是什么？你的地役期还剩多少时间？当你的生活重新属于你自己时，你有什么计划？",

	"You believe the clergy of the Earthheart to be inherently corrupt, since many of his clerics and paladins are drawn from among Solace�s elite: the wealthy and powerful farming families. The only way to root out this corruption, you and others of your thinking maintain, is for His clergy to be headed instead by the city�s druid circles.": "你认为大地之心的神职人员本质上是腐败的，因为他的许多神职人员和圣骑士都来自索拉斯的精英阶层：富裕而强大的农耕家庭。你和其他与你想法相同的人认为，根除这种腐败的唯一方法是让他的神职人员改由城市的德鲁伊圈子领导。",

	"In Solace, magic is a tool that's incorporated into many jobs. There are entirely magical careers, such as the medium or oracle. But much of the time, mundane skill and magic are combined together. A lamplighter can work with mundane lanterns, but also learns the vagaries of of maintaining the everbright lanterns that light the city's streets. Chefs often heat and flavor food with a cantrip. A locksmith may learn to cast arcane lock, and an actor may learn thaumaturgy to help project their voice or create stage effects. If you take this background, it is recommended that you play either some sort or caster and/or take Magic Initiate as your free feat, choosing a few spells that would have served you in your line of work.

In doing so, you provided a valuable service by providing your fellow citizens with much-needed resources, and did so at considerable danger to your own person. As such, members (whether current or former) of scavenging crews that explored the Broken Lands are looked on with favor and admiration by their fellow citizens.

Alternately, you may have never left the city at all and simply be a denizen of the lower levels who scrounges discarded tech that has fallen from the upper tiers of the city.
