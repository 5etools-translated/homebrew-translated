Are you from one of the wealthy families that owns terraced farmland sloping down from the city's walls, or greenhouses on the upper levels where plants can get sunlight? Or did you labor as a simple farmhand? In either case, you are accustomed to long days of hard work. If you were of one of the wealthy farming families, however, you also enjoyed the privileges of your station, including frequent meals made with real food rather than bland but filling conjured foodstuffs.": "你一生中大部分时间都在与绿地人合作，为城市生产食物，或者照料农作物，或者照料牲畜，或者两者都照料。你是来自那些拥有从城墙上倾斜下来的梯田的富裕家庭，还是在上层拥有植物可以得到阳光的温室？或者你是作为一个简单的农场工人而劳动？无论是哪种情况，你都习惯于长时间的艰苦工作。然而，如果你是一个富裕的农家，你也会享受到你的地位所带来的特权，包括经常用真正的食物而不是平淡但能填饱肚子的魔法食品做饭。",

	"Convicted of a crime in Solace, you have been sentenced to dedicate a year of your life to bettering the city and improving the lives of its citizens. This punishment was imposed through the geas spell, and may have initially taken the form of either manual or martial labor, depending on your character�s talents, skills, and experience. Were you assigned to a batallion along the outer walls, defending the city from Maelstrom-born horrors alongside the Wardens? Or did you work as part of a clean-up crew duty in the Dead Ward, rebuild damaged city buildings, or some other type of duties? At this point, you�ve been reassigned to finish out the rest of your sentence in the frontier as a conscript adventurer.

What are your plans for when your life is your own again?": "在索拉斯被判定有罪，你被判处将你的生命中的一年时间用于改善这个城市和改善市民的生活。这个惩罚是通过geas咒语实施的，最初可能采取手工或武术劳动的形式，这取决于你的角色的天赋、技能和经验。你是否被分配到外墙的一个小队，与守护者一起保卫城市不受来自漩涡的恐怖影响？或者你是作为清洁队的一部分在死亡区工作，重建受损的城市建筑，或者其他类型的职责？在这一点上，你已经被重新分配到边疆作为一个应征的冒险者来完成你剩余的刑期。这是你必须争取的，还是城市官员强加的另一个不必要的负担？你的罪行是什么？你的地役期还剩多少时间？当你的生活重新属于你自己时，你有什么计划？",
	"You are familiar with how the dirty parts of Solace's city infrastructure works, and as soon as people notice the bracelet on your arm, that's all they really see. As a result, you can easily gain access to the city's low- to mid-level-security military fortifications, as well as sites where city work crews are common, such as the Dead Ward and various government facilities. What's more, other geas'd conscripts are inclined to commiserate. If you spend at least 10 minutes in friendly conversation with a geas'd conscript NPC, they tend to be inclined to help you out, though not necessarily to stick their own neck out for you.": "你熟悉索拉斯的城市基础设施的肮脏部分是如何运作的，只要人们注意到你手臂上的手镯，他们真正看到的就是这个。因此，你可以很容易地进入城市的中低级安全的军事工事，以及城市工作团队常见的场所，如死亡区和各种政府设施。更重要的是，其他被geas'd征兵的人都倾向于同情。如果你花了至少10分钟的时间与一个被加持过的应征者NPC进行友好的交谈，他们往往会倾向于帮助你，尽管不一定会为你伸出自己的脖子。",
