	"A starforged's life is dedicated to understanding its first thought, normally to answering its question or unveiling the meaning behind that thought. Starforged are innately curious about the world, learning by testing and observing how things work. They tend to be empathetic to other humanoids wanting to achieve humanity.

This makes them violent and quick to anger when humanoids are hostile towards them.": "一个星际锻造者的生命致力于理解它的第一个想法，通常是为了回答它的问题或揭开这个想法背后的意义。星际锻造者天生对世界充满好奇，通过测试和观察事物的运作来学习。他们倾向于对其他想要实现人性的人类有同情心。然而，如果他们的主人在他们觉醒之前对他们足够糟糕的话，他们会对人类产生怨恨。这使得他们在人类对他们有敌意时，会变得很暴力，而且很快就会发怒。",
