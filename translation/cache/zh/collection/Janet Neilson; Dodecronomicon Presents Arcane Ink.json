	"A well-appointed-shop in a major city; a shaman's tent in a tiny village; a witch's hut on a deserted coastline. In all these places and more, a fortunate and well-traveled adventurer might find a convenient and permanent - if costly alternative to spell scrolls, potions or magical artefacts in the art of magical tattoos.": "大城市里设备齐全的商店；小村庄里萨满的帐篷；荒废的海岸线上的巫师小屋。在所有这些地方以及更多地方，一个幸运的、善于旅行的冒险家可能会发现一个方便的、永久的--即使是昂贵的替代法术卷轴、药水或魔法文物的魔法纹身艺术。",
	"Simple in concept, tricky in execution, a magical tattoo largely resembles a spell scroll or magical item. It allows a character who has one to c ast one spell as shorthanded by the symbol inked into their skin when the tattoo is activated. The use of a magical tattoo does not require the use of a spell slot, nor is any given magical tattoo restricted to a specific class; a wealthy bard, for instance, might obtain a Glyph of Life Aura, or a paladin who has failed one too many saving throws against the Frightened condition might save her coin for a Glyph of Countercharm.": "魔法纹身的概念很简单，执行起来却很棘手，它在很大程度上类似于一个咒语卷轴或魔法物品。它允许拥有这种纹身的角色在纹身激活时，通过在皮肤上涂抹符号来速成一种法术。使用魔法纹身不需要使用法术槽，任何特定的魔法纹身也不限于特定的等级；例如，一个富有的吟游诗人可能会得到一个生命光环的字样，或者一个对受惊状态多次挽救失败的圣骑士可能会把她的硬币存起来买一个反咒的字样。",
	"Arcane tattoos require a combination of skills. The glyphs must be done perfectly and on ver y specific areas of the body dependent on the spell. The enchanted inks must be mixed to the exactly correct proportions. Generally, only the eldest and wisest arc anists can perform this art alone, and most at least have an apprentice to help with the more mundane elements. A magical tattoo shop will generally have one arc anist to mix the inks, another to design the glyphs, and a third to actually wield the needle. This makes the process costly, but worthwhile when performed by experts.": "奥术纹身需要多种技能的结合。字形必须完美地完成，并根据咒语在身体的特定部位完成。被施了魔法的墨水必须以完全正确的比例混合。一般来说，只有最年长和最聪明的弓箭手才能单独完成这项艺术，而且大多数人至少有一个学徒来帮助处理更多的世俗元素。一家魔法纹身店一般会有一名弧形使者来混合墨水，另一名弧形使者来设计石刻，还有一名弧形使者来实际挥动针头。这使得这个过程成本很高，但如果由专家来完成，则是值得的。",
	"There is more to a magical tattoo than simply magical ink and the correct design. A magical tattoo can only be effective if loc ated in the right spot on the wearer's body. Two tattoos cannot share space on one spot on the wearer's body, as the interaction between the two glyphs nullifies the magic and can have unforeseen and devastating effects. Thus a character considering a permanent Glyph of Blade Ward might consider whether that is the tattoo that would serve them best long-term, or whether they should wait and save up for better things.": "魔法纹身不只是简单的魔法墨水和正确的设计。魔法纹身只有在佩戴者身上的正确位置才会有效。两个纹身不能在佩戴者身体的一个位置上共用空间，因为两个字形之间的相互作用会使魔法失效，并可能产生不可预知的破坏性影响。因此，一个考虑永久的 \"刀锋护卫 \"字样的角色可能会考虑这是否是对他们最有利的长期的纹身，或者他们是否应该等待并为更好的东西积蓄资金。",
	"For most people, tattoos are seen as a permanent piece of body art. However, in a world redolent of magic, true permanence is rare at best. magical tattooists provide the option of temporary versions of the permanent glyphs, allowing an adventuring party of means to experiment with what might serve them best in the long term, while filling the tattooist's coffers.": "对于大多数人来说，纹身被看作是一种永久性的人体艺术。然而，在一个充满魔力的世界里，真正的永久性充其量也不过如此。魔法纹身师提供了永久性石刻的临时版本的选择，允许有能力的冒险者尝试什么可能在长期内最适合他们，同时填补纹身师的财库。",
	"Likewise, an adventurer could pay a tattooist to remove a tattoo that is not as useful as they might like to replace it with something better. Of course, the ability to remove a magical tattoo does not only lie with benign tattooists looking to make some gold, and an unwar y adventurer might find their previously inked skin suddenly bare if they face the wrong foe.": "同样地，冒险家可以付钱给纹身师，让他去掉一个不那么有用的纹身，用更好的东西来代替它。当然，去除魔法纹身的能力并不只存在于想赚取金币的良性纹身师身上，如果面对错误的敌人，不善于作战的冒险者可能会发现他们之前涂抹的皮肤突然裸露出来。",
	"While most races have no issues with being tattooed, an arcane inker may encounter some difficulties with the scales of a dragonborn, or a kenku's feathers. However, these unconventional races can still benefit from magical tattoos:": "虽然大多数种族在纹身方面没有问题，但奥术师在处理龙族的鳞片或肯库的羽毛时可能会遇到一些困难。然而，这些非常规的种族仍然可以从魔法纹身中获益。",
	"Magical tattoos on dragonborn involve painting the glyph onto the dragonborn's scales first, then applying the needle.": "龙族的魔法纹身是先将字形画在龙族的鳞片上，然后再施针。",
	"Feathered races such as the kenku tend to result in dyed feathers in the approximate shape of the glyph as the ink seeps into the feathers themselves. Magical tattooists need to be very careful of ink bleed, as if not handled carefully, the redistribution of the ink will affect the spell.": "有羽毛的种族，如肯库人，往往会因为墨水渗入羽毛本身而导致羽毛染成石刻的大致形状。魔法纹身师需要非常小心墨水的渗入，因为如果不小心处理，墨水的重新分布会影响到法术。",
	"A similar situation occurs with furred races like the charr or tabaxi; the fur tends to absorb the ink at the root, changing the colours of their fur in the approximate tattoo design.": "类似的情况也发生在像查尔或塔巴克斯这样的毛皮种族身上；毛皮往往会在根部吸收墨水，在近似的纹身设计中改变其毛皮的颜色。",
	"For these races, the process of magical tattooing takes longer, and is more costly, but is still just as worth it as it is in any other race.": "对于这些种族来说，魔法纹身的过程需要更长的时间，而且成本更高，但仍然和其他种族一样值得。",
	"Some spells require more than ink on skin to perform correctly, and require a combination of magical jewelery and correctly applied piercings to fully engage with the wearer. A few suggestions for these will be available at the end of this book.": "有些法术需要比皮肤上的墨水更多的东西才能正确执行，需要结合神奇的珠宝和正确应用的穿孔来与佩戴者充分接触。本书末尾将提供一些关于这些的建议。",
	"Magical tattoos are a double-edged sword. On one hand, a well-chosen ability could pry an epic last-minute win from the jaws of defeat. However, used incorrectly, these could break an entire game. A dungeon master who wants to use these may want to consider the following when making magical tattoos available in-game.": "神奇的纹身是一把双刃剑。一方面，一个精心选择的能力可以从失败中撬出一个史诗般的最后一分钟的胜利。然而，如果使用不当，这些可能会破坏整个游戏。想使用这些能力的地下城主在游戏中提供魔法纹身时，可能要考虑以下几点。",
	"Placing limits on how a magical tattoo can be used, and how many times, is probably the best way of dealing with the inherent balance issues. After all, magical tattooing is a costly business, requiring specialised knowledge, tools and components to implement. Keeping the cost high encourages players to consider exactly what they want to get out of their magical tattoo, and how to fit their desires into their existing budget. This has the added advantage of being able to offer your players a new encounter as they tr y to raise money for that highly useful permanent tattoo... or even hunt for the raw ingredients requested by the tattooist, depending on setting.": "对魔法纹身的使用方式和次数进行限制，可能是处理内在平衡问题的最佳方式。毕竟，魔法纹身是一项昂贵的业务，需要专门的知识、工具和组件来实现。保持高成本鼓励玩家考虑他们想从魔法纹身中得到什么，以及如何将他们的愿望融入现有的预算。这有一个额外的好处，那就是当你的玩家为那个非常有用的永久纹身筹集资金时，他们可以为他们提供一个新的遭遇......甚至可以根据设定，寻找纹身师要求的原料。",
	"In a magical setting such as this, there is no reason that a tattoo of this type needs to be permanent. When offering this option to players, consider a tiered price list: a signific ant but moderately affordable price for a single-use glyph that will fade after its first use, a barely affordable price for multiple but limited uses (three or five, depending on the effect) and a prohibitive price on a permanent mark.": "在这样一个神奇的环境中，没有理由让这种类型的纹身成为永久性的。在向玩家提供这种选择时，考虑一个分层的价格表：对于第一次使用后就会褪色的一次性石刻，有一个明显的蚂蚁但适中的价格；对于多次但有限的使用（三或五次，取决于效果），有一个勉强可以承受的价格；对于永久性标记，有一个令人望而却步的价格。",
	"Additionally, c are should be taken to ensure that a tattoo's abilities not be overused. Smaller tattoos should only be used after a short or long rest, or a certain number of times per day, as any other magical item.": "此外，应确保纹身的能力不会被过度使用。较小的纹身只能在短期或长期休息后使用，或者像其他魔法物品一样，每天使用一定的次数。",
	"One way of making magical tattoos less of a game-breaker is to subject them to the same rules and restrictions as any other spell. While still c arr ying the advantages of not spending a spell slot and not being restricted by class, a tattoo that c asts a Concentration effect would still require concentration on the part of the wearer, so they could not have another Concentration spell in effect while the tattoo is active. This prevents the game-breaking 'dual Concentration spell' effect that 5e was designed to prevent.": "让魔法纹身不至于破坏游戏的一个方法是让它们受到与其他法术一样的规则和限制。虽然仍有不花法术槽和不受等级限制的优势，但一个能产生专注效果的纹身仍需要佩戴者集中注意力，因此在纹身激活时，他们不能有另一个专注法术生效。这就防止了5e所设计的破坏游戏的 \"双重专注咒语 \"效果。",
	"Another method of ensuring that players don't overstack themselves with magical tattoos is to restrict the number of tattoos they can wear. While not requiring attunement in the manner of most magical items, various types of tattoo must be inked onto certain spots on the body to be effective, which restricts the number and type. For instance, protective glyphs such as Glyph of Blade Ward and Glyph of Ice Armor are worn on the same spot over the breastbone, restricting a character to having only one of these at any given time.": "另一种确保玩家不会用魔法纹身过度堆积的方法是限制他们可以佩戴的纹身数量。虽然不需要像大多数魔法物品那样进行调整，但各种类型的纹身必须在身体的某些位置上涂上墨水才能生效，这就限制了纹身的数量和类型。例如，保护性的字形，如 \"护刃字形 \"和 \"冰甲字形\"，必须佩戴在胸骨上的同一位置，限制一个角色在任何时候只能拥有一个。",
	"Spells granted to the wearer of a magical tattoo can only be at their lowest level, unless specific ally established to be at a higher level. For instance, a character might request a Fire Bolt with more oomph, and gain it at a higher level, at increased cost.": "授予魔法纹身佩戴者的法术只能是最低级别的，除非特定的盟友确定为更高的级别。例如，一个角色可能会要求一个更有威力的火弹，并以更高的等级获得它，但代价也会增加。",
	"Additionally, magical tattoos should be restricted to spells that directly affect the target. While there could be some leeway in terms of spells that generate auras, or small-scale offensive spells such as Eldritch Blast or Fire Bolt, the spell contained in the tattoo should affect only the wearer or, at a pinch, require direct physical contact with a single enemy (for instance, Glyph of Contagion).": "此外，魔法纹身应该被限制在直接影响目标的法术上。虽然在产生光环的法术方面可以有一些回旋余地，或者小规模的攻击性法术，比如 \"长生爆 \"或 \"火弹\"，但纹身中包含的法术应该只影响佩戴者，或者在紧要关头，需要与单个敌人有直接的身体接触（比如 \"传染之术\"）。",
	"Another way to reduce a tattoo's usage is to make it firmly part of the game world on a stor y level, rather than just another magical item. When world-building, consider that some countries might have laws against magical tattoos of that nature. Alternatively, perhaps the practice of magical tattooing is so well-known in the game world that enterprising arc anists and spellc asters have found ways to nullify or even steal magical tattoos. This adds an element of challenge and danger to simply having such tattoos, and creates a chance of the wearer being unable to use them.": "另一个减少纹身使用的方法是在故事层面上让它成为游戏世界的坚实组成部分，而不是另一个魔法物品。在构建世界时，考虑到一些国家可能有法律禁止这种性质的魔法纹身。另外，也许魔法纹身的做法在游戏世界中非常有名，以至于有进取心的弓箭手和法术师已经找到了使魔法纹身失效甚至偷窃的方法。这给单纯拥有这种纹身增加了挑战和危险的因素，并创造了佩戴者无法使用它们的机会。",
	"Finally, one of the better ways of ensuring nothing too game breaking finds its way onto a character's skin is to restrict the availability of certain spells beyond the simple cost. While the option exists to allow your players to ask in character if a particular spell is available on a tattoo, thus letting the DM decide whether it should exist and how much it would cost if it did, it's better to have at least a general idea what would or would not be available in that particular location based on what you as the DM think would be reasonable for your campaign.": "最后，要确保没有什么太过破坏游戏的东西会出现在角色的皮肤上，最好的办法之一是限制某些法术的可用性，而不是简单的成本。虽然可以让玩家在角色中询问某个特定的法术是否可以在纹身上使用，从而让管理员决定它是否应该存在，以及如果它存在的话需要多少钱，但最好是根据你作为管理员认为对你的活动来说是合理的，至少有一个在那个特定地点可用或不可用的大致概念。",
	"What follows is a list of basic tattoos that might be available in any loc ation that designs and inks magical tattoos. Obviously DMs should feel free to create their own if they feel so inspired, and only make available those they feel would be relevant or reasonable for their own campaign. Pricing is up to the DM, and should be adjusted dependent on location, local rules and regulations, and how hard the players are willing to work for the advantages conferred by a magical tattoo.": "下面是一个基本的纹身清单，在任何设计和涂抹魔法纹身的地方都可能有。显然，如果DM感到有灵感的话，应该自由地创造他们自己的，而且只提供他们认为与自己的活动有关或合理的。价格由DM决定，并应根据地点、当地的规则和条例以及玩家愿意为魔法纹身带来的好处付出多少努力来调整。",
	"The more common magical tattoos are of the protective variety, designed to augment an adventurer's armour. Some of the designs are gifts from the gods, as clerics provide help with the glyphs in exchange for donations to their respective shrines. Others are created entirely by abjuration specialists of the various magical schools. Whatever the origin of the design, these tattoos tend to be small, discreet and imbued with protective magics.": "更常见的魔法纹身是保护性的，旨在增强冒险者的护甲。有些设计是来自神灵的礼物，因为神职人员提供字形的帮助以换取对各自神殿的捐赠。还有一些完全是由各魔法学校的咒语专家创造的。无论设计的来源是什么，这些纹身往往是小的、谨慎的，并被赋予了保护性的魔法。",
	"This small glyph is worn on the breastbone, and is activated when slapped once with an open palm. On activation, the wearer gains the effect of {@spell Blade Ward}.": "这个小石刻戴在胸骨上，用张开的手掌拍打一次就能激活。激活后，佩戴者会获得（%0%）的效果。",
	"Worn on the breastbone and activated when slapped once with an open palm, this tattoo grants the wearer the effect of {@spell Blur}.": "佩戴在胸骨上，当张开手掌拍打一次后激活，这个纹身会赋予佩戴者（%0%）的效果。",
	"Worn behind the left ear and activated by tapping it three times in quick succession, this tattoo provides the wearer with the effect of Bardic Countercharm.": "佩戴在左耳后，通过快速连续敲击三次来激活，这个纹身为佩戴者提供吟游诗人反击术的效果。",
	"A stylised red mask with a silver-grey face emerging from it Worn on the breastbone and activated when slapped once with an open palm, this tattoo provides the wearer with the effect of Mislead.": "一个有银灰色面孔的红色面具，佩戴在胸骨上，用手掌拍打一次就能激活，这个纹身为佩戴者提供误导的效果。",
	"Worn on the breastbone and activated with a slap with an open palm, this tattoo grants the wearer the effect of {@spell Absorb Elements}.": "佩戴在胸骨上，用张开的手掌拍打激活，这个纹身赋予佩戴者（%0%）的效果。",
	"Worn around both wrists and activated by crossing the wrists together in front of the face, this tattoo grants the wearer the effect of {@spell Flame Shield}.": "佩戴在两只手腕上，通过在脸前交叉手腕来激活，这个纹身赋予佩戴者（%0%）的效果。",
	"Worn around the left wrist and activated with a slap with an open palm, this tattoo grants the wearer the effect of {@spell Freedom of Movement}. This affects the wearer ONLY.": "佩戴在左手手腕上，用手掌拍打激活，这个纹身会给佩戴者带来（%0%）的效果。这只影响到佩戴者。",
	"Worn on the breastbone and activated when slapped once with an open palm, this tattoo grants the effect of {@spell Armor of Agathys}.": "佩戴在胸骨上，用手掌拍打一次就能激活，这个纹身能获得（%0%）的效果。",
	"Worn across both shoulder blades to the fronts of the shoulders and down the upper arms, and activated by placing both hands on the shoulders, this tattoo grants the wearer the effects of either {@spell Investiture of Fire}, {@spell Investiture of Fire}, {@spell Investiture of Stone} or {@spell Investiture of Wind}. The tattoo can only grant one investiture, chosen on initial application.": "穿过两个肩胛骨到肩膀前面，再到上臂，将双手放在肩膀上激活，这个纹身会赋予佩戴者{@spell Investiture of Fire}、{@spell Investiture of Fire}、{@spell Investiture of Stone}或{@spell Investiture of Wind}的效果。纹身只能赋予一个投资，在最初应用时选择。",
	"Worn around the right wrist and up the back of the hand, and activated when the hand is flexed three times in quick succession, this tattoo casts {@spell Aura of Life} on the wearer.": "佩戴在右手腕和手背上，当手快速连续弯曲三次时被激活，这个纹身会在佩戴者身上投下（%0%）。",
	"Worn on the right ankle and activated by stomping the right foot twice, this tattoo grants the effect of {@spell Expeditious Retreat}.": "佩戴在右脚踝上，通过两次踩踏右脚来激活，这个纹身给予（%0%）的效果。",
	"Work around the right wrist and up the back of the hand and activated when the hand is flexed three times in quick succession, this tattoo grants the wearer the effect of {@spell Aura of Purity}.": "这个纹身在右手腕和手背上，当手快速连续弯曲三次时被激活，这个纹身给予佩戴者的效果是（%0%）。",
	"Worn directly over the heart and activated by slapping the mark with an open palm, this tattoo grants the effect of {@spell Misty Step}.": "直接穿在心脏上，用张开的手掌拍打印记来激活，这个纹身会给予（%0%）的效果。",
	"Worn directly over the heart and activated by slapping the mark with an open palm, this tattoo grants the effect of {@spell Stoneskin}.": "直接穿在心脏上，用张开的手掌拍打印记来激活，这个纹身会给予（%0%）的效果。"
