	"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): This 'white' meat is actually pinkish-brown even when cooked due to the high iron content born from its home plane of Acheron. It's rather tough meat, and smells faintly of its smoky breath. It's difficult to obtain achaierai meat as in some places the fiends bodies vanish on death to their respective lower planes, but in places where the corpse survives the meat can be harvested. The meat is tough enough to dull typical iron knives, and so many pre-cook the meat in a slow cooker to tenderize it, then grill it afterword. This is also done because the temperatures needed to properly cook the meat is higher than most, near the melting point of iron, and as such it is often cooked in blacksmith's furnaces. However once properly prepared it is a delicious and rich smoky flavor which 'tastes like chicken'. Care is needed in cooking. If undercooked the eater suffers as if they had been exposed to the achaierai black cloud ability. However when properly cooked the eater gains the ability to use the achaierai's black cloud ability once. Multiple meals do not stack, so a creature can only have one black cloud at a time.": "{@bold Description}（面向玩家）。这种 \"白色 \"的肉即使在烹调时也是粉红色的，这是因为它的母体阿克伦星球上的铁含量很高。这是一种相当坚韧的肉，闻起来有淡淡的烟熏味。要获得Achaierai的肉是很困难的，因为在一些地方，恶魔的尸体在死亡后会消失在各自的低层世界，但在尸体存活的地方，肉是可以收获的。这种肉很坚硬，足以使典型的铁刀变钝，因此许多人在慢炖锅中预先将肉煮软，然后再进行烧烤。这样做的原因还在于，适当烹调肉所需的温度高于大多数，接近铁的熔点，因此它经常在铁匠的炉子里烹调。然而，一旦准备得当，它就会有一种美味和丰富的烟熏味，\"吃起来像鸡肉\"。烹饪时需要注意。如果煮得不熟，吃的人就会受到影响，就像他们被暴露在achaierai黑云的能力之下一样。然而，如果烹调得当，食用者将获得一次使用Achaierai的黑云能力的能力。多次进食不能叠加，所以一个生物一次只能有一个黑云。",
	"{@bold Features} (GM Facing): The type of cloud depends upon the preparation - DC 14 (Fog Cloud); DC 18 (Stinking Cloud); DC 22 - Cloudkill. It lasts until discharged without concentration.
