	"Tattoo magic is an incredibly old form of magic, and is a form of art utilized by many different cultures across the multiverse. The designs and function of these tattoos varies wildly between peoples, races, species, countries, continents, and planes, from a lucky charm for sailors, to a mark for slaves.": "纹身魔法是一种非常古老的魔法形式，也是整个多元宇宙中许多不同文化所使用的艺术形式。这些纹身的设计和功能在不同的民族、种族、物种、国家、大陆和星球之间有很大的差异，从水手的幸运符到奴隶的标记。",
	"In order to create a tattoo, either mundane or magical, the artist must have proficiency with {@item tattooist's tools|MagicalTattoos}, which are a type of artisan's tools. In order to ink a magical tattoo onto a wearer, the artist must have proficiency with tattooist's tools and must be able to cast at least one spell.": "为了创造一个纹身，无论是世俗的还是魔法的，艺术家必须熟练掌握（%0%），这是一种工匠的工具。为了在穿戴者身上纹上魔法纹身，艺术家必须熟练掌握纹身师的工具，并且必须能够施展至少一种法术。",
	"Whenever you would gain proficiency with a type of artisan's tools from a background, you may substitute that proficiency for proficiency with tattooist's tools instead. Your DM may allow you to gain proficiency with tattooist's tools over the course of play.": "每当你从背景中获得一种工匠工具的熟练度时，你可以用纹身师工具的熟练度来代替该熟练度。你的管理员可以允许你在游戏过程中获得对纹身师工具的熟练度。",
	"This kit is a sturdy briefcase which can hold a variety of hammers, needles, medical supplies needed for sterilization, and differently colored inks, all of which are necessary in the creation of magical and mundane tattoos. The kit may also include a sketchbook filled with original designs, and has space for any magical templates the owner finds during their journeys.": "这个工具包是一个坚固的公文包，可以容纳各种锤子、针头、消毒所需的医疗用品，以及不同颜色的墨水，所有这些都是创造魔法和世俗纹身所必需的。这套工具还可能包括一本写满原创设计的素描本，并有空间容纳主人在旅途中发现的任何魔法模板。",
	"When an artist first gains proficiency with tattooist's tools, their teacher gives them a sketchbook containing designs for a number of Simple or Average tattoos equal to 5 + their Intelligence modifier.": "当艺术家第一次获得熟练掌握纹身工具时，他们的老师会给他们一本素描本，其中包含简单或普通纹身的设计，数量等于5+他们的智力修正值。",
	"The sketchbook is a unique compilation of designs, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that they received as a gift from their teacher, a finely bound gilt-edged tome they found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after they lost their previous sketchbook in a mishap.": "素描本是一个独特的设计汇编，有自己的装饰性花纹和边注。它可能是他们从老师那里收到的一本普通的、实用的皮革书，也可能是他们在古老的图书馆里发现的一本装订精美的金边小册子，甚至是他们在一次意外中丢失了以前的素描本后搜罗到的一本散装笔记。",
	"Most examples of tattoo templates are exceedingly rare and either well-hidden or carefully guarded, as existing tattoos are either culturally significant or highly prized by their current owners. In rare cases, ancient tattoo templates may be found in such areas as ancient temple walls or found carved into totems. The most common way to learn a new template is to copy it from a tattooed person. Copying the design of a tattoo from another body requires the tattooist make an Intelligence check. The DC is determined by the condition of the body:": "大多数纹身模板的例子都是极其罕见的，要么被很好地隐藏起来，要么被小心翼翼地保护起来，因为现有的纹身要么具有文化意义，要么被其当前的主人高度珍视。在罕见的情况下，古老的纹身模板可能会在古代寺庙墙壁等地方被发现，或者被发现刻在图腾上。学习新模板最常见的方法是从纹身的人身上复制。从另一个人身上复制纹身的设计需要纹身师进行智力测验。智力值由身体的状况决定。",

	"Dead, tatto design is not intact": "死亡，纹身设计不完整",
	"The size and intricacy of tattoos will determine the amount of resources needed to copy the tattoo. An artist will need to spend 2 hours and 50 gp to copy a design into their sketchbook. This amount increases by 2 hours and gp for each size and intricacy level, to a maximum of 10 hours and 250 gp for a Large Ornate tattoo. Once a tattoo is copied into a sketchbook, a template may then be created. Creating a template costs the same amount, in time and materials, as copying the design in the first place, and each template may be used only once.": "纹身的大小和复杂程度将决定复制纹身所需的资源数量。一个艺术家需要花费2小时和50GP来复制一个设计到他们的素描本中。每种尺寸和复杂程度的纹身都会增加2小时和金币，大型装饰性纹身最多为10小时和250金币。一旦纹身被复制到素描本中，就可以创建一个模板。创建一个模板所花费的时间和材料与最初复制设计的费用相同，并且每个模板只能使用一次。",
	"Artists can copy a design from their own sketchbook into another book–for example, if they want to make a backup copy of their sketchbook. This is just like copying a new template, but faster and easier, since they understand their own notation and already know how to apply the tattoo. They need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each size and intricacy level of the tattoo. If the sketchbook is lost, they can use the same procedure to transcribe the designs that they can remember (an amount equal to their Intelligence (History) modifier, minimum of 0) into a new sketchbook. Filling out the remainder of the sketchbook requires them to find new templates to copy, as normal. For this reason, many artists keep backup sketchbooks in a safe place.": "艺术家可以从自己的素描本上复制一个设计到另一个本子上--例如，如果他们想做一个素描本的备份。这就像复制一个新的模板一样，但是更快、更容易，因为他们了解自己的记号，并且已经知道如何应用纹身。他们只需要花1个小时和10个金币来完成每个大小和复杂程度的纹身。如果素描本丢失了，他们可以用同样的程序将他们能记住的设计（相当于他们的智力（历史）修正值，最低为0）转录到一个新的素描本中。填满草图本的剩余部分需要他们找到新的模板来复制，和平常一样。出于这个原因，许多艺术家把备份的素描本放在一个安全的地方。",
	"In order to apply a tattoo, there must first be room to draw it into the skin. Every tattoo has a size and location. The size of the tattoo scales with the size of the creature. Because of this, a Large chest tattoo would take up the same space on a human, a halfling, or a giant, as the size of the tattoo stays proportional to the size of the creature it is applied to.": "为了应用纹身，首先必须有空间将其画进皮肤。每个纹身都有一个尺寸和位置。纹身的大小与生物的大小成正比。正因为如此，在人类、半身人或巨人身上，一个大胸脯的纹身会占用同样的空间，因为纹身的大小与所适用的生物的大小成正比。",

You can gain additional uses of a tattoo by increasing its size or intricacy by one step, up to a max of Large size and Ornate intricacy. Tattoos that provide a constant effect are unable to be modified in this manner.": "纹身可以是小的、中的或大的，也可以是简单的、一般的或华丽的。你可以通过增加纹身的大小或复杂程度来获得额外的使用权，最多可达到大尺寸和华丽的复杂程度。提供持续效果的纹身不能以这种方式修改。",
	"Increasing the size or intricacy of the tattoo doubles the price for each increase.": "增加纹身的大小或复杂程度，每增加一次，价格就增加一倍。",
	"A modified tattoo counts as a different tattoo for purposes of placing it in a sketchbook, but a tattoo can be modified at the time of application by increasing the tattooist's tools DC by 5.": "修改后的纹身算作是一个不同的纹身，以便将其放入素描本中，但在应用时可以通过增加纹身师的工具DC 5来修改纹身。",
	"You really enjoy the look and feeling of having tattoos. You may have more tattoos than your body would normally allow. You may either have 1 additional Large tattoo, 2 additional Medium tattoos, or 4 additional Small tattoos.": "你非常喜欢有纹身的外观和感觉。你可能有比你的身体通常允许的更多的纹身。你可能会有一个额外的大型纹身，两个额外的中型纹身，或四个额外的小型纹身。",
	"The requirements for each tattoo are different, but the general rule is that larger and more intricate tattoos require more time and ink to apply.": "每个纹身的要求是不同的，但一般来说，更大和更复杂的纹身需要更多的时间和墨水来应用。",

	"Tattoos take time to apply based on their size and intricacy. A large but simple tattoo may take the same amount of time to ink as it would to create a small but detailed one. Sessions may be broken into chunks of time over the course of several days, however if the tattoo is not finished within 30 days the magics of the tattoo dissipate and must be started again from the beginning. Some tattoo mages will demand full payment upfront, while others will charge a part of the price across each individual session. After the tattoo is finished, you gain the effects of it after a long rest. Use the following table to determine how long the procedure will take.": "纹身需要根据其大小和复杂程度来应用时间。一个大而简单的纹身可能需要同样多的时间来上墨，就像创造一个小而详细的纹身一样。疗程可以分成几天的时间，但是如果在30天内没有完成纹身，纹身的魔力就会消散，必须从头再来。一些纹身法师会要求预先全额付款，而另一些则会在每个时段收取部分费用。纹身完成后，经过长时间的休息，你会获得它的效果。用下面的表格来确定这个过程需要多长时间。",

	"The properties of magical tattoos permeate deep within the muscles and sinew of the body, and are in most senses permanent. Very few have ever been reported as having lost their magical properties, even if the tattoo is no longer visible on the skin. Incredibly deep burns or loss of limb removes the magically enchanted parts of the body, removing the effects of any tattoos on that body part, and possibly allowing for another tattoo to be acquired. Limbs regrown with regenerate do not grow back their tattoos. Spells such as raise dead generally keep the tattoos intact, given that the limb is still present. Reincarnation will not bring back the subject with their tattoos intact. Clones made with the clone spell do not have tattoos.": "魔法纹身的特性渗透到身体的肌肉和筋骨深处，在大多数意义上是永久性的。很少有报告说它们失去了魔法特性，即使纹身在皮肤上不再可见。难以置信的深度烧伤或失去肢体会移除身体上被施了魔法的部分，消除该身体部位的任何纹身的效果，并可能允许获得另一个纹身。用再生术重生的肢体不会再长出纹身。诸如 \"起死回生 \"之类的法术通常会保持纹身的完整，因为肢体仍然存在。轮回术不会让受术者带着他们的纹身完整地回来。用克隆法术制造的克隆人没有纹身。",
	"Both magical and non-magical tattoos should be recorded to check whether a character has room for a new tattoo. Unless specifically noted under the tattoo description, any additional applications of the same tattoo will not confer additional magical effects.": "魔法的和非魔法的纹身都应该被记录下来，以检查一个角色是否有空间进行新的纹身。除非在纹身描述中特别指出，任何同一纹身的额外应用都不会赋予额外的魔法效果。",
