	"{@creature Fuji|GaGR} is the almighty goddess of Mount Fuji, fire, and all volcanoes. Her followers depend on her favor to endure the cold winters. Though destructive and powerful, Fuji is beautiful and soft. And like a volcano, she is calm until angered, destroying all that stand in her way. In this regard, her power is unmatched. Those who worship her draw upon her strength to carry them through difficult times when calm is needed or to find the inner strength to strike down those who would hurt them.": "{@creature Fuji|GaGR}是全能的富士山、火和所有火山的女神。她的追随者依靠她的宠爱来忍受寒冷的冬天。虽然富士山具有破坏性和强大的力量，但它是美丽而柔和的。就像一座火山，她在被激怒之前一直很平静，摧毁所有挡在她面前的东西。在这方面，她的力量是无可匹敌的。那些崇拜她的人借助她的力量，在需要平静的时候带着他们度过困难时期，或者找到内在的力量来打击那些会伤害他们的人。",
	"Fire rituals to honor Fuji can be as simple as a candle or as destructive as a forest fire, though the latter is rare. A bonfire or brazier fire is the most common way to honor Fuji. These fire rituals are utilized to bless harvests, promote general wellness in the body, and help protect from evil spirits.": "纪念富士山的火仪式可以像蜡烛一样简单，也可以像森林大火一样具有破坏性，不过后者很少见。篝火或火盆是纪念富士山最常见的方式。这些火的仪式被用来祝福收成，促进身体的普遍健康，并帮助保护免受恶灵的侵害。",
	"Fuji demands little from her followers. The faith promotes inner strength, independence, and a calm spirit. Rules would detract from her objective. That said, Fuji does ask her followers to stretch their limits and remove themselves from comfort zones. Each cycle is designed to bring renewal, but also new strengths. Fall and winter are times of rest and contemplation, while spring and summer are times of devotion and learning. Even into old age, a follower of Fuji is expected to ever grow.": "富士对其追随者的要求不高。这种信仰提倡内在的力量、独立和平静的精神。规则会减损她的目标。尽管如此，富士确实要求她的追随者伸展他们的极限，把自己从舒适区移开。每个周期都旨在带来更新，但也有新的力量。秋天和冬天是休息和沉思的时候，而春天和夏天是奉献和学习的时候。即使到了晚年，富士的追随者也被期望不断成长。",
	"It is the duty of every follower of Fuji to conduct an annual pilgrimage to an honorable mountain during the spring or summer.": "每个富士山的追随者都有义务在春季或夏季对一座尊贵的山进行年度朝圣。",
	"Priests and priestesses of Fuji are contemplative and solitary, focusing their mental energies on meditation and the mountain. In this way, they are more like monks, focusing inward on their own progression. However, when driven to extremes, the leaders of the faith can assemble a force of soldiers quickly, bringing Fuji's wrath upon any foe of the faith. This quiet nature that can turn so quickly to violence is one of the faith's strongest tools, teaching others to leave the faithful alone. Fuji's warriors are skilled in numerous weapons and unarmed fighting techniques.": "富士山的祭司和女祭司是沉思和孤独的，将他们的精神能量集中在冥想和山上。以这种方式，他们更像僧侣，专注于自己的进步。然而，当被驱使到极端的时候，信仰的领导者可以迅速地召集一支士兵队伍，将富士的愤怒带给任何信仰的敌人。这种可以迅速转变为暴力的安静天性是该信仰最强大的工具之一，它教导其他人不要打扰信仰者。富士的战士们精通许多武器和徒手格斗技巧。",
	"Fuji's clergy are tasked with producing \"pure fire,\" the only type allowed in sacred ceremonies and rituals. Pure fire is produced by striking stone and steel together or by igniting a certain type of wood. The lighting of pure fire on new year's day is key to the survival of Fuji's followers. This fire is given to each follower and taken home to light their hearths, protecting them for one year.": "富士的神职人员的任务是生产 \"纯火\"，这是神圣仪式和典礼中唯一允许的类型。纯火是通过将石头和钢铁撞击在一起，或通过点燃某种类型的木材产生的。在新年当天点燃纯火是富士山追随者生存的关键。这种火被送给每个追随者并带回家点燃他们的壁炉，保护他们一年。",
	"The goddess's temples are built in hot places and at the bases of volcanic mountains. Each temple is a simple affair, with views toward the mountain and/or nature. A central hearth is key to the temple's design, providing a place to conduct rituals, cook, and provide warmth in winter.": "女神的寺庙建在炎热的地方和火山的底部。每座庙宇都很简单，可以看到山和/或大自然的景色。中央炉灶是庙宇设计的关键，它提供了一个进行仪式、做饭和在冬季提供温暖的地方。",

	"her majesty cannot be held!": "皇帝陛下不能被拘留!",
	"She is a spirit-mysterious!": "她是一种精神--神秘的!",
	"Followers of the great fire goddess seek meditation and patience, inner strength and power over themselves. But this power also manifests in physical ways. Most of Fuji's worshippers learn to practice some kind of martial art, especially with their hands. Clerics and paladins learn to use Fuji's preferred weapons, but a large number of monks worship the goddess as well. In fact, fighting monks who worship the goddess learn a special technique unavailable to other monks.": "大火女神的追随者寻求冥想和耐心、内在的力量和对自己的权力。但这种力量也体现在身体上。大多数富士的崇拜者都学习练习某种武术，尤其是用手。教士和圣骑士学会使用富士的首选武器，但大量的僧侣也崇拜这位女神。事实上，崇拜女神的战斗僧侣学会了一种其他僧侣无法使用的特殊技巧。",

	"The divine {@creature Freyja|GaGR} is a powerful deity, resembling something between a fair maiden and a lustful giant. Her arms are long and white, capable of lighting up the underworld. Freyja is the goddess of love, fertility, sorcery, and war. She rules over many aspects of the living world and the afterlife. In fact, Freyja rules over more domains than many other gods, being a source of inspiration for thousands. She is even the muse of sacred poetry. Those seeking meditative insight into their ills visit the churches of Freyja on a regular basis.": "神性（%0%）是一个强大的神灵，类似于一个美丽的少女和一个好色的巨人之间的东西。她的手臂又长又白，能够照亮冥界。弗雷娅是爱情、生育、巫术和战争的女神。她统治着生活世界和来世的许多方面。事实上，芙蕾雅统治的领域比其他许多神都多，是成千上万人的灵感来源。她甚至是神圣诗歌的缪斯。那些寻求冥想洞察力的人经常去弗里亚的教堂，了解他们的疾苦。",
	"She also serves those who have fought in war, especially conscripts and farmers who've been forced into battle. As such, those who die honorably in battle go to Fólkvangr (in Vanaheimr) with her {@creature valkyrie|GaGR|valkyries} instead of Valhalla. Once in Fólkvangr, the dead enjoy a peaceful rest of meadows and fields.": "她也为那些参加过战争的人服务，特别是那些被迫参加战斗的应征者和农民。因此，那些在战斗中光荣牺牲的人将和她一起去Fólkvangr（在Vanaheimr）而不是Valhalla（%0%）。一旦到了福尔克万格，死者就会在草地和田野上享受平静的休息。",
	"As a ruler of fertility and childbirth, she is praised for and is a protector of pregnant women. Of all her values, her followers most honor her power over births. Maidens (the names of her followers) often sing and chant around another follower who is giving birth to ease the child into the world. At the time of one's birth, a female child is given an animal totem as a guide through life, while a male child is given a small weapon as a trinket.": "作为生育和分娩的统治者，她被赞誉为孕妇的保护者。在她所有的价值中，她的追随者最尊重她对生育的权力。少女们（她的追随者的名字）经常在另一个正在分娩的追随者身边唱歌和诵经，以使孩子顺利进入世界。在一个人出生的时候，女婴会得到一个动物图腾作为生活的指南，而男婴则会得到一个小武器作为饰品。",
	"The goddess rides a chariot pulled by two huge forest cats—{@creature Bygul|GaGR} and {@creature Trigul|GaGR|Trjegul}. She is also associated with the boar or swine because of the animal's fertile nature. However, the boar is often depicted charging into battle.": "女神骑着一辆战车，由两只巨大的森林猫拉着--（%0%）和（%1%）。她还与野猪或猪联系在一起，因为这种动物具有肥沃的特性。然而，野猪经常被描绘成冲锋陷阵的样子。",
	"Freyja is a truth seeker. She bestows insight and teaches her followers to look inward and explore their inner emotions, especially the parts they don't wish to acknowledge. Freyja's magical nature is dualistic, examining positive and dark magics. For some of her followers, this is a difficult balancing act. For others, they take one path over the other.": "芙蕾雅是一个真理探索者。她赐予洞察力，教导她的追随者向内看，探索他们的内在情感，尤其是他们不愿意承认的部分。弗雷娅的魔法性质是二元的，考察积极和黑暗的魔法。对她的一些追随者来说，这是一个困难的平衡行为。对其他人来说，他们会选择一条道路而不是另一条。",
	"She harshly punishes those who abandon her teachings. Her followers are the first to exact vengeance based on the number of secrets a follower attempting to abandon the faith knows, going as far as to kill a follower who \"knows too much.\" If the followers are unable to exact justice, Freyja sends a massive wild boar to kill the heretic in the most heinous way possible.": "她严厉地惩罚那些放弃她的教义的人。她的追随者首先根据试图放弃信仰的追随者所知道的秘密数量进行报复，甚至可以杀死 \"知道太多 \"的追随者。如果追随者无法伸张正义，芙蕾雅会派出一头巨大的野猪，以最令人发指的方式杀死异教徒。",
	"The clergy of Freyja are mostly women, priestesses who gather the flock into nature to experience the world and pay homage to Freyja. Her churches are simple and adhere to their natural surroundings: leaning trees, fallen rocks, waterfalls, and so on. A cleric of Freyja spends her morning praying in nature, near a brook or stream, trying to connect with her natural surroundings while being keenly aware of her inner self.": "弗雷娅的神职人员大多是女性，是将羊群聚集到大自然中体验世界并向弗雷娅致敬的女祭司。她的教堂很简单，并依附于其自然环境：倾斜的树木、倒下的岩石、瀑布等等。弗雷娅的教士在大自然中，在小溪或小河边度过她的早晨，试图与她的自然环境相联系，同时敏锐地意识到她的内在。",
	"The highest-ranking priestess of Freyja is known as the \"Mare,\" and there is only ever one at a time. The lead cleric of any temple bears no title. She is known simply as \"mother\" or \"sister.\"": "弗雷亚最高级别的女祭司被称为 \"母神\"，而且每次只有一个。任何寺庙的首席教士都没有头衔。她只被称为 \"母亲 \"或 \"姐妹\"。",

	"Freyja's followers come from all walks of northern life, though most are peaceful and commonly. There are, however, warriors and mages who turn to Freyja for guidance and a better afterlife. But it is Freyja's clerics and paladins who form her dogmatic bulwark. Elves and humans are the only races allowed to worship Freyja, though rumor has it a few dwarves have slipped into some progressive temples. The majority of her followers are female as well, meaning that males rarely enter into the highest ranks of the faith.": "弗雷娅的追随者来自北方生活的各行各业，尽管大多数人都是和平的、普通的。然而，也有战士和法师向弗雷亚寻求指导和更好的来世。但正是弗雷亚的神职人员和圣骑士构成了她教条式的堡垒。精灵和人类是唯一被允许崇拜弗雷亚的种族，尽管有传言说一些矮人已经溜进了一些进步的寺庙。她的大多数追随者也是女性，这意味着男性很少进入信仰的最高级别。",
	"Sacrifices made in Freyja's name are simple. They can be the blood of her enemies, falcon eggs, flowers from the Fehu tree, secret words learned in study, a song, sweet honey, or even tears. There is little ceremony to it. Instead, Freyja rejoices in the gifts and time spent with her followers. So long as the gifts are given from the heart, she does not care. Ritual is for more ostentatious gods.": "以芙蕾雅的名义所做的祭品很简单。它们可以是她敌人的血、猎鹰蛋、费胡树上的花、学习中的密语、一首歌、甜蜜的蜂蜜，甚至是眼泪。这没有什么仪式可言。相反，芙蕾雅对礼物和与她的追随者共度的时光感到高兴。只要这些礼物是发自内心的，她就不会在意。仪式是为更多浮夸的神灵准备的。",
	"Just before winter, an old cow is sacrificed to Freyja. The animal is slaughtered then smoked and eaten as part of a massive feast.": "就在冬天来临之前，一头老牛被献给弗雷亚。动物被宰杀，然后被熏制，作为大规模宴会的一部分被吃掉。",

	"The Underworld": "冥界",
	"{@creature Batara Kala|GaGR}—the Lord of the Eight Hot Hells—is a god of the underworld, where he rules from a cave with his wife. He is also the god of destruction, earth, light, and time—the name Kala literally means time. He is a frightening, hideous, loathsome-looking, rude ogre. He is immensely tall, his hair is made of fire, his body is covered in fur, and his fingertips are knives.": "{@creature Batara Kala|GaGR}--八大地狱之主--是冥界之神，他和他的妻子在一个山洞里统治。他也是毁灭之神、大地之神、光明之神和时间之神，卡拉这个名字的字面意思是时间。他是一个可怕的、狰狞的、令人厌恶的、粗鲁的食人魔。他非常高大，他的头发是火做的，他的身体覆盖着毛皮，他的指尖是刀子。",
	"More demon than god, he is always hungry. Batara Kala chases the moon and sun each day in an attempt to eat both, but he only succeeds during an eclipse. In order to help the moon and sun escape Batara Kala's massive maw, the people bang pots and create noise during the eclipse. And each time, the moon and sun escape.": "他与其说是神，不如说是恶魔，他总是很饿。巴塔拉-卡拉每天追着月亮和太阳，试图吃掉它们，但他只在日食期间成功。为了帮助月亮和太阳逃离巴塔拉-卡拉的巨口，人们在日食期间敲打锅子，制造噪音。而每一次，月亮和太阳都能逃脱。",
	"Batara Kala also enjoys eating children, especially those who stray from home or who are born into bad families. Some people believe Batara Kala is the son of Shiva, conceived by a fish that swallowed Shiva's essence. Others believe he is an ogre who was mortal until he drank the waters of paradise so he could live forever. For doing so, he was punished, and his head was removed. But the immortal water allowed his head to live on without his body.": "巴塔拉-卡拉还喜欢吃孩子，特别是那些离家出走或出生在不良家庭的孩子。有些人相信巴塔拉-卡拉是湿婆的儿子，由一条吞下湿婆精华的鱼所孕育。其他人则认为他是一个食人魔，在喝下天堂之水之前一直是凡人，这样他就可以永生。因为这样做，他受到了惩罚，他的头被砍掉了。但不朽之水允许他的头在没有身体的情况下继续生存。",
	"Batara Kala is not directly worshipped but is recognized by most people. He lives in the lower world, while humanity lives in the middle world, and the gods live in the numerous heavens and planes. Batara Kala is a dark and powerful force, either punished for his transgressions or sent here to punish humanity.": "巴塔拉-卡拉不被直接崇拜，但被大多数人认可。他生活在下层世界，而人类生活在中层世界，诸神则生活在无数的天堂和平面。巴塔拉-卡拉是一种黑暗而强大的力量，要么因为他的过错而受到惩罚，要么被派到这里来惩罚人类。",
	"This latter condition of the god is most important. Batara Kala serves two functions. First, he teaches people to fear the forces of the heavens. Batara Kala's rage is unmeasured, and it is unknown what will set him off. Second, he teaches against having children out of wedlock or through incest. This second lesson is a darker principle that keeps the peasantry in line. Those who fear the wrath of Batara Kala fall in line with the rest of the prevailing cultural mores.": "后面这个神的条件是最重要的。巴塔拉-卡拉有两个功能。首先，他教导人们要敬畏上天的力量。巴塔拉-卡拉的愤怒是无法估量的，不知道什么会让他发怒。第二，他教导人们反对非婚生子女或通过乱伦生孩子。这第二课是一个让农民保持一致的黑暗原则。那些害怕巴塔拉-卡拉的愤怒的人，与其他流行的文化习俗保持一致。",
	"There are few devoted followers of Batara Kala. Most are afraid of his wrath and give lip service through ritual and music. Those zealous enough to serve the god are angry and bitter people themselves. Clerics who worship Batara Kala are not fascinated with death but with darker emotions, and paladins are more likely to lash out in rage rather than religious devotion.": "巴塔拉-卡拉的忠实追随者很少。大多数人害怕他的愤怒，通过仪式和音乐进行口头服务。那些热心为神服务的人本身就是愤怒和痛苦的人。崇拜巴塔拉-卡拉的教士们并不迷恋死亡，而是迷恋黑暗的情绪，而圣骑士们更有可能在愤怒中发泄，而不是在宗教奉献中发泄。",
	"Batara Kala is worshipped openly during specific festivals. There are few churches erected in his honor. However, some clerics gather their small flocks into dark caves.": "巴塔拉-卡拉在特定的节日里被公开供奉。为纪念他而建立的教堂很少。然而，一些神职人员将他们的小羊群聚集到黑暗的洞穴中。",

	"{@creature Baba Yaga|GaGR|Baba Yaga's} story starts at the beginning of time—perhaps even before. She was born of stone, or turned to stone by her own magic—this remains a mystery. She comes from a time when mankind was rough but wise and honored their elders, a time when the word \"witch\" meant \"wise\" and when grandmothers taught their tribes the art of giving birth. Baba Yaga is the first such woman who understood the mystery of birth and death. Baba Yaga (literally woman of stone) is as much an earth elemental as she is a goddess. Her wisdom endures now through nature, and her original form is still rumored to reside in a craggy mountainside in the cold northern lands.": "{@creature Baba Yaga|GaGR|Baba Yaga's}的故事开始于时间的开始，也许甚至更早。她从石头中诞生，或者被她自己的魔法变成了石头--这仍然是一个谜。她来自一个人类粗糙但明智并尊重长者的时代，一个 \"女巫 \"一词意味着 \"智慧 \"的时代，祖母们教他们部落的生育艺术。巴巴-亚加是第一个了解出生和死亡之谜的这样的女人。巴巴亚加（字面意思是石头女人）既是地球元素，又是女神。她的智慧现在通过自然界得以延续，而且据传她的原形仍然居住在寒冷的北方土地上的一个峭壁山坡上。",

Koschei can shapeshift into a whirlwind, summoning thunder and lightning at will.": "巴巴-雅加的力量是巨大和无尽的。她统治着空气、地球、火和水这四个元素。她还豢养了许多忠实的仆人，周围有看不见的哀号的灵魂。在她的仆人中，有（%0%），她把它们分别称为她的 \"明亮的黎明、红色的太阳和黑暗的午夜\"（）。还有一个牧民，（%%1%），不能被杀死。他是一个高大、骨瘦如柴的邪恶巫师，骑着他的黑色骏马在山中穿行。科斯奇可以变身为旋风，随意召唤雷霆和闪电。",
	"Baba Yaga is depicted as the deformed-looking crone with a large nose and teeth of iron. Sometimes she haunts stories of children being taken into the forest and baked into bread. But sometimes she is depicted as the helpful old woman who guides lost travelers home. She is enigmatic, complicated, and inconsistent. Like nature itself, Baba Yaga is a force beyond measure. She is the perennial witch and mother of winter. She is the birds, clouds, death, matriarch, mermaids (rusalka), moon, pelicans, and snakes. She is the watcher of wicked thoughts. Baba Yaga guards over what she considers her people. Unlike most gods, she has no temples nor proselytizers who spread the word of her faith. Rather, she is the shepherd of the weak, teaching them to grow strong and punishing those who grow arrogant or wicked.": "巴巴亚加被描绘成长相畸形的老妪，有一个大鼻子和铁齿。有时她会萦绕在儿童被带入森林并被烤成面包的故事中。但有时她又被描绘成一个乐于助人的老妇人，引导迷路的旅行者回家。她是神秘的，复杂的，不一致的。就像大自然本身一样，巴巴-雅加是一种无法衡量的力量。她是常年的女巫和冬天的母亲。她是鸟、云、死亡、母体、美人鱼（Rusalka）、月亮、鹈鹕和蛇。她是邪恶思想的监视者。巴巴亚加守护着她认为是她的人民。与大多数神不同，她没有寺庙，也没有传播她的信仰的传教士。相反，她是弱者的牧羊人，教导他们变得强大，并惩罚那些变得傲慢或邪恶的人。",
	"Unlike other deities, she lives among the people in a tiny hut in the woods. She is everywhere at once, and her presence is always felt. Even if she is not seen, people entering the forest know she sees them. The old crone is a feared and respected watcher, only revealing herself when necessary.": "与其他神灵不同的是，她住在人们中间，在树林里的一个小屋里。她随时随地都在，人们总能感觉到她的存在。即使她没有被看到，进入森林的人也知道她看到他们。老妪是一个令人敬畏和尊重的观察者，只有在必要时才会暴露自己。",
	"Whether or not a peasant knows the name Baba Yaga, they all know the stories of the wicked old witch, the enduring spirit of the forest who punishes the foolhardy and arrogant while vexing the innocent and lost. Baba Yaga is an eternal force of nature, not too far removed from {@deity Hekate|GaGR}, but less primordial and less self-interested. Those who obey Baba Yaga are rewarded, often with wisdom, but sometimes with a more tangible gift. But those who defy her are eaten. This parable reflects the old crone's duality. Those who honor nature benefit from it; those who fight it surely perish.": "无论农民是否知道巴巴-亚加这个名字，他们都知道这个邪恶的老巫婆的故事，这个持久的森林之灵惩罚了愚蠢和傲慢的人，同时使无辜和迷失的人烦恼。巴巴-亚加是一种永恒的自然力量，与{@deity Hekate|GaGR}相差不大，但没有那么原始，也没有那么自作主张。那些服从巴巴-雅加的人得到奖励，通常是智慧，但有时是更具体的礼物。但那些违抗她的人被吃掉了。这个寓言反映了老妪的双重性。尊敬自然的人从自然中受益；与自然对抗的人肯定会灭亡。",
	"Baba Yaga has no temples and demands no worship. She commands respect and fear, and this is enough. Clerics and paladins honor her through wisdom and teaching, imparting lost knowledge to others who pay homage to the old crone.": "Baba Yaga没有寺庙，也不要求崇拜。她让人尊敬和恐惧，这就足够了。教士和圣骑士通过智慧和教导来尊重她，将失去的知识传授给向老妪致敬的人。",
	"Wisdom is the most important tool of Baba Yaga's followers, who have taken it upon themselves to serve her. Because she demands nothing, her followers serve her of their own accord out of a sense of their own duty.": "智慧是巴巴-雅加的追随者最重要的工具，他们以服务她为己任。因为她不要求什么，她的追随者出于自己的责任感而主动为她服务。",

	"Baba Yaga's faith is strongest among rural people struggling against the forces of nature. They know the value of the wise witch's teachings and apply her lessons—or suffer the consequences. Arrogance is not tolerated by Baba Yaga, nor do her followers brook offenses against the community. Those who think themselves better than others (and especially nature) are punished accordingly.": "Baba Yaga的信仰在与自然力量斗争的农村人中最为强烈。他们知道聪明的女巫的教诲的价值，并应用她的教训，或承担后果。巴巴亚加不容忍傲慢，她的追随者也不容忍对社区的冒犯。那些认为自己比别人（尤其是自然）强的人将受到相应的惩罚。",

	"{@creature Athena|GaGR} sprang forth from the mind of Zeus, cracking open his head as she emerged regal, composed, and gleaming in full armor. Born fully formed from the king of gods, Athena stood stoic and tall as the goddess of war. Athena presented humanity with a gift—the olive tree—from which they reaped wood, oil, food, and prosperity. Thus, Athena became the goddess of civilization and a beacon of all that lends a city its strength: law, justice, craft, courage, war, and wisdom.": "{@creature Athena|GaGR}从宙斯的脑海中涌现出来，当她身着全副盔甲，威风凛凛，镇定自若，熠熠生辉时，他的头颅也随之裂开了。雅典娜从众神之王那里完全诞生，作为战争女神，她坚毅而高大。雅典娜向人类赠送了一份礼物--橄榄树--他们从中收获了木材、石油、食物和繁荣。因此，雅典娜成为文明的女神，也是所有赋予城市力量的灯塔：法律、正义、工艺、勇气、战争和智慧。",
	"Although some gods of war rely on savagery, bloodlust, and destruction, Athena is shrewd and disciplined. She teaches instead calm and cunning tactics, strategic warfare, and keenly honed battle skills. As such, she's recognized as a guardian and ally of warriors, rulers, and heroes. Athena is known to send adventurers with valiant aspirations on quests that test their brilliance and bravery. When heroes thrust themselves into dire straits in the name of justice, Athena might intervene to turn the tides in their favor. At the very least, her presence is believed to bestow or bolster courage among honorable hearts.": "虽然有些战神依靠野蛮、嗜血和破坏，但雅典娜是精明和有纪律的。她教导的是冷静和狡猾的战术、战略战争和敏锐的战斗技巧。因此，她被认为是战士、统治者和英雄的守护者和盟友。众所周知，雅典娜会派有雄心壮志的冒险家去执行任务，考验他们的智慧和勇气。当英雄们以正义的名义将自己推入困境时，雅典娜可能会出面干预，使局势向他们倾斜。至少，她的存在被认为能赋予或增强可敬之心的勇气。",
	"Athena appears as a gray-eyed female human warrior cloaked and armed with a spear, feathered helmet, and a shield adorned with the image of a gorgon's head. She is often accompanied by a snowy-white owl whose ability to see through darkness mirrors the insight of Athena's godly wisdom.": "雅典娜以一个灰眼睛的人类女战士的形象出现，她身披斗篷，手持长矛、羽毛头盔和装饰有戈尔贡头像的盾牌。她经常由一只雪白的猫头鹰陪伴，猫头鹰看穿黑暗的能力反映了雅典娜的神性智慧的洞察力。",
	"Beyond warfare, Athena is a goddess of the arts and crafts. She herself invented the first ship, the flute, the chariot, the plow, the potter's wheel, and other useful tools. She's also patron to metalworkers who forge armor and weapons.": "除了战争，雅典娜还是一位艺术和手工艺的女神。她自己发明了第一艘船、笛子、战车、犁、陶器轮和其他有用的工具。她也是锻造盔甲和武器的金属工人的守护神。",
	"Athena's demeanor is characterized by calm, compassion, and mercy, but the goddess does not tolerate disrespect. Legends say a weaver named Arachne insulted Athena by boasting of her skill and creating a tapestry that displayed the Olympian gods' failings. Athena lauded Arachne's craftsmanship—she is a lawful goddess, after all—and then turned Arachne into a spider.": "雅典娜的举止以平静、怜悯和仁慈为特点，但这位女神并不容忍不敬。传说中，一位名叫阿拉克尼的织工侮辱了雅典娜，她吹嘘自己的技艺，并制作了一幅挂毯，展示了奥林匹斯众神的失败。雅典娜称赞了阿拉克尼的手艺--毕竟她是一位合法的女神，然后把阿拉克尼变成了一只蜘蛛。",
	"Followers of Athena know this goddess of war prefers peace whenever possible. War is a tool, and often a last resort, to resolve conflict. Rather than brute strength, Athena teaches the values of ingenuity, invention, and intelligence. Calm, rational thought not only strengthens warriors in battle but furthers civilization.": "雅典娜的追随者知道这位战争女神在可能的情况下更倾向于和平。战争是一种工具，而且往往是解决冲突的最后手段。雅典娜教给人们的不是粗暴的力量，而是机智、发明和智慧的价值。冷静、理性的思考不仅能增强战士的战斗力，还能促进文明的发展。",
	"Athena also taught her followers mathematics and household arts like spinning and weaving fabric. She empowers her followers that through hard work and action they can acquire knowledge and skill.": "雅典娜还教她的追随者数学和家庭艺术，如纺纱和织布。她赋予她的追随者权力，通过努力工作和行动，他们可以获得知识和技能。",
	"The cults of Athena are led by priestesses who maintain her temples and tend her statues, which are thought to be hallowed artifacts of protection. To honor the goddess of craft, the priestesses weave fabric for sacred robes, which are processed through the city and draped protectively over Athena's statue.": "对雅典娜的崇拜由女祭司领导，她们维护她的庙宇，照料她的雕像，这些雕像被认为是神圣的保护文物。为了向工艺女神致敬，女祭司们为神圣的长袍织布，这些长袍在城市里被加工，并被保护性地披在雅典娜的雕像上。",
	"Powerful clerics of Athena are known as \"Athena Polias.\" They are Athena's right hand on the Material Plane and are held in the highest esteem among her followers, akin to incarnations of the goddess herself.": "强大的雅典娜神职人员被称为 \"雅典娜波利亚\"。他们是雅典娜在物质世界的右手，在她的追随者中受到最高的尊敬，就像女神本人的化身。",
	"Athena's worshippers are many and varied. Leaders of military ask for battle strategy and help in war. Artisans pray for guidance in their craft and study. Heroic adventurers request her vigilant guardianship and bolstered courage. Farmers thank her for her wisdom and invention. As goddess of civilization, her domains touch all aspects of life, especially urban life, and she is revered as a primary goddess in regions that worship her.": "雅典娜的崇拜者有很多，而且种类繁多。军队的领导人要求在战争中制定作战策略和提供帮助。工匠们祈求在他们的工艺和研究中得到指导。英雄的冒险家们请求她给予警惕的守护和强大的勇气。农民们感谢她的智慧和发明。作为文明女神，她的领域涉及生活的各个方面，特别是城市生活，她在崇拜她的地区被尊为主要女神。",

	"{@creature Anansi|GaGR} is a trickster and the keeper of all knowledge and stories. He takes the form of a spider and spins giant webs in the forest. There, he catches all of the stories from people's dreams and gossip. Anansi sometimes keeps the stories for himself, but other times he shares the knowledge with the world so they might become wise.": "{@creature Anansi|GaGR}是个捣蛋鬼，是所有知识和故事的守护者。他以蜘蛛的形式出现，在森林里织出巨大的网。在那里，他从人们的梦境和闲谈中捕捉到所有的故事。阿南斯有时为自己保留这些故事，但其他时候他与世人分享这些知识，使他们成为聪明人。",
	"He acts as a go-between for humans and other gods, and he is the one responsible for tricking the divine into creating night, rain, and other natural phenomena. However, his aims are never noble. Anansi entertains himself by tricking humans (and the gods) through complicated pranks. Sometimes he gains nothing from the pranks other than the joy of having made people work harder. He's even gone so far as to trick followers into believing he created the world.": "他充当人类和其他神灵的中间人，是他负责欺骗神灵创造黑夜、雨水和其他自然现象。然而，他的目的从来都是崇高的。阿南西通过复杂的恶作剧来欺骗人类（和神灵），以此自娱自乐。有时他从这些恶作剧中一无所获，除了让人们更加努力工作的喜悦。他甚至还欺骗追随者，让他们相信是他创造了这个世界。",
	"Anansi can also change into a fox, rabbit, or human at will. Unlike other gods whose deeds and prowess reside in a few stories about the creation of the world, Anansi's history rests in thousands of stories of trickery. Everything we know about the spider-god—parables that teach humanity how to be humble and learn their place in the world, or stories expanding humanity's realm of knowledge—stem from the word-of-mouth stories that are told in his name.": "阿南斯还能随意变成狐狸、兔子或人类。与其他神灵不同的是，他们的事迹和能力只存在于几个关于创造世界的故事中，而阿南斯的历史则存在于成千上万的诡计故事中。我们所知道的关于蜘蛛神的一切--教导人类如何谦虚和了解自己在世界中的地位的寓言，或者扩大人类知识领域的故事--都来自于以他的名义所讲的口口相传的故事。",
	"Anansi cares only for himself and expects nothing less from his subjects. However, there is a deeper lesson in Anansi's work that he expects his followers to understand. His lessons are a form of tough love stemming from the cultural climate of those who follow him. Life is unforgiving. Those who do not learn from their failings will surely die. Anansi is there to teach people these lessons without causing anyone harm. And if that leads to people being filled with fear of the gods, so be it. Better afraid than dead.": "阿南斯只关心自己，对他的臣民没有任何期望。然而，在阿南斯的作品中，有一个更深的教训，他希望他的追随者能够理解。他的教训是一种严厉的爱，源于追随他的人的文化氛围。生活是无情的。那些不从失败中学习的人肯定会死。阿南西在那里给人们上这些课，但不会对任何人造成伤害。如果这导致人们对神灵充满了恐惧，那就这样吧。恐惧总比死亡好。",
	"Anansi has no temples. Those who serve him do so to travel the world in search of knowledge, secrets, and stories. They have no other higher calling, are not concerned with saving innocent lives (unless it fits their purposes), and do not make oaths, except to their god and knowledge. Whatever the lesson, clerics and paladins of Anansi always recite a parable in which mortals (or the gods) were tricked by Anansi's cunning.": "阿南西没有寺庙。那些为他服务的人为了寻找知识、秘密和故事而周游世界。他们没有其他更高的使命，不关心拯救无辜的生命（除非符合他们的目的），除了对他们的神和知识之外，不发誓言。不管是什么课程，阿南西的教士和圣骑士总是背诵一个凡人（或神）被阿南西的狡猾所欺骗的寓言。",
	"The trickster Spider fooled others in order to gather knowledge from the gods.": "诡计多端的斯派德愚弄他人，以便从神灵那里收集知识。",
	"Greedy Anansi hoarded this wisdom and stories at the top of a very tall tree, until the knowledge grew so heavy, it came crashing to the ground, releasing all the wisdom within.": "贪婪的阿南西把这些智慧和故事囤积在一棵很高的树顶上，直到这些知识变得如此沉重，坠落到地上，释放出里面所有的智慧。",
	"It scattered to the corners of all the lands, and it was by this that man learned to fish, hunt, and farm.": "它散布在所有土地的角落里，而人类正是通过它学会了捕鱼、打猎和耕种。",
	"True and dedicated followers of Anansi honor the god for one of two reasons. The first is simple fear that the god will bring them harm. The second is a deep desire to trick others. This latter follower is one to be feared. Any person who would gladly worship the most cunning spirit of them all is one who does not understand Anansi's true meaning. Those who learn to beguile and trick others have no place among the community that raised them.": "阿南西的真正和忠实的追随者出于以下两个原因之一而尊敬该神。第一个是简单的恐惧，担心神会给他们带来伤害。第二种是对欺骗他人的深切渴望。这后一种追随者是值得敬畏的。任何乐意崇拜最狡猾的神灵的人都是不理解阿南西的真正含义的人。那些学会诱骗和欺骗他人的人在养育他们的社区中是没有地位的。",
	"Sages, elders, and parents all understand the value of Anansi's stories. They grow up fearing the spider-god but eventually learn the value of his teachings. If one lives long enough, one clearly knows the value of Anansi's stories. But the \"ruse\" is in using these stories to help children grow up in a hostile world. By extension, the strongest and smartest followers in the world worship Anansi and eventually learn the importance of his word.": "圣人、长者和父母都明白阿南西的故事的价值。他们在成长过程中惧怕蜘蛛神，但最终了解到他的教诲的价值。如果一个人活得足够长，就会清楚地知道阿南西的故事的价值。但 \"诡计 \"在于利用这些故事来帮助孩子们在一个充满敌意的世界中成长。推而广之，世界上最强壮、最聪明的追随者都崇拜阿南斯，并最终了解到他的话的重要性。",
	"Mankind is hardwired for faith. Before the invention of pottery and agriculture, humans had already invented the gods some 25,000 years before. The first deities were aspects of nature: animals spirits, tree spirits, the sea and sky, and so on. All of nature was to be revered.": "人类是有信仰的，这是硬性规定。在发明陶器和农业之前，人类已经在大约25000年前发明了神灵。第一批神灵是自然界的各个方面：动物的精神、树木的精神、海洋和天空，等等。所有的自然界都应受到敬重。",
	"Stories were handed down by word of mouth, and nature started to take on anthropomorphic form. A spider spirit morphed into a human god with spider legs. The trees and lakes became a goddess who could transform from human into water or water nymph.": "故事被口口相传，自然界开始以拟人化的形式出现。一个蜘蛛精蜕变成一个有蜘蛛腿的人神。树木和湖泊变成了一个可以从人变成水或水仙的女神。",
	"The original stories were lost to time, but as mankind developed written languages, the gods took the forms we now understand. For centuries cultures collided, borrowing from one another's stories so that gods like Ishtar, Isis, Mithra, and Aphrodite all started to look alike. North Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and India all flourished with tales of thousands of gods and goddesses. As people migrated and cultures came in contact with one another, Europe and Asia added their tales to the growing tapestry of world religions.": "最初的故事被时间湮没了，但随着人类书面语言的发展，众神呈现出我们现在理解的形式。几个世纪以来，各种文化相互碰撞，互相借用对方的故事，以至于像伊什塔尔、伊希斯、米特拉和阿佛洛狄忒这样的神灵都开始变得相像。北非、中东、地中海和印度都兴起了数以千计的神明和女神的故事。随着人们的迁徙和文化的相互接触，欧洲和亚洲将他们的故事加入到不断增长的世界宗教的织锦中。",
	"With the advent of monotheism, these religions became mythologies, and a single creator began to replace the scores of pantheons dotting the globe. Missionaries brought word of a single god to every society, and many cultures lost their spiritual heritage.": "随着一神论的出现，这些宗教变成了神话，一个单一的创造者开始取代遍布全球的几十个万神殿。传教士把单一的神带到每个社会，许多文化失去了他们的精神遗产。",
	"It would not be until the 18th century and the German advent of Religionsgeschichtliche that other faiths would be taken seriously as \"cultural phenomenon\" again. It is from this school of thought that so many stories were rescued and our modern snapshot of mythologies starts to take shape.": "直到18世纪，德国出现了Religionsgeschichtliche，其他信仰才再次作为 \"文化现象 \"被认真对待。正是从这一学派中，许多故事被抢救出来，我们现代的神话快照开始形成。",
	"But this book is not about Western, arm-chair philosophers trying to make sense of the ancient world from their ivory watchtowers. This book is about the celebration of faiths from all corners of the globe, reimagined in a gaming context.": "但这本书不是关于西方的、坐在扶手椅上的哲学家试图从他们的象牙瞭望台上理解古代世界。这本书是关于庆祝来自全球各个角落的信仰，在游戏背景下进行重新想象。",
	"These gods and goddesses are our nineteen favorites from a host of pantheons, spanning thousands of years of written and oral histories. Time has been spent not only examining them in their historical context, but also keeping as much of their genuine histories alive while still making them playable in a fantasy campaign world.": "这些神灵是我们从众多万神殿中选出的19位最受欢迎的神灵，跨越了数千年的书面和口头历史。我们不仅在历史背景下对他们进行了研究，而且还尽可能多地保留了他们的真实历史，同时还使他们在奇幻的战役世界中可以发挥作用。",
	"We've gone the extra mile of making them all part of the same cultural gestalt, putting African, meso-American, and even a Mongolian god right next to each other in a fantasy world. The dynamic environment here should be obvious. What happens when the followers of Shiva and Tengri meet each other, arguing over who invented the world?": "我们已经做了额外的努力，使他们都成为同一个文化格式塔的一部分，把非洲、中美洲、甚至是蒙古的神放在一个幻想的世界里，彼此相邻。这里的动态环境应该是很明显的。当湿婆和腾格里的追随者遇到对方，为谁发明了这个世界而争论时，会发生什么？",
	"Fantasy gaming has introduced many gods from the Western World time and again. But we think the material here, written in this manner, reveals the most important element of faith: respect for heritage. Where a god or goddess comes from is just as important as the ideas that are spawned from their philosophies.": "幻想游戏一次又一次地引入了许多来自西方世界的神灵。但我们认为，这里的材料以这种方式写出来，揭示了信仰的最重要因素：尊重遗产。一个神或女神来自哪里，与他们的哲学所产生的思想同样重要。",
	"We hope these introductions to some amazing gods inspire you to dig deeper into the faiths of the ancient (and, in some cases, modern) world. And at the very least, may they lead to some great stories.": "我们希望这些对一些令人惊奇的神的介绍能激发你深入挖掘古代（以及在某些情况下，现代）世界的信仰。最起码，希望它们能带来一些伟大的故事。",

	"What motivates your clerics and paladins? What new abilities and spells will your players use? If you are a GM, have new encounters for your players with an upstart religious group. Perhaps all these new gods and goddesses have recently appeared in the last dozen years or slowly built a following over the centuries. The possibilities are virtually endless.": "是什么激励了你的牧师和圣骑士？你的玩家会使用什么新的能力和法术？如果你是GM，为你的玩家准备新的遭遇，与新起的宗教团体相遇。也许所有这些新的神明和女神都是最近十几年才出现的，或者是在几个世纪里慢慢建立起来的。这种可能性几乎是无穷无尽的。",
	"Has there ever been a time when a character could encounter such a divine being? While it would never be recommended to have a conflict with a deity's avatar, the gods' stats and other mechanicals info are provided. These are super-powered entities with which players should take extreme caution, even at levels 20 and beyond. Some deities are so powerful that they can wipe out an army or city in moments. Proceed with extreme caution when encountering any avatar.": "是否曾有过一个角色能遇到这样的神灵？虽然绝不建议与神灵的化身发生冲突，但提供了神灵的状态和其他机械信息。这些都是超级强大的实体，玩家应该特别小心，即使是在20级以上。有些神灵非常强大，他们可以在瞬间消灭一支军队或城市。在遇到任何化身时都要非常小心。",
	"Additionally, the gods and goddesses within have at their disposal many companions who will assist them when called upon. These companion encounters are more likely for mortals. However, make no mistake—these are the most supreme powers in all of creation, and they will use all the tools at their disposal if their plans are disrupted. These deities can literally change the course of history overnight.": "此外，里面的诸神和女神有许多同伴，他们在被召唤时将协助他们。这些同伴的遭遇对凡人来说更有可能。然而，不要搞错了--这些是所有造物中最至高无上的力量，如果他们的计划被打乱，他们会使用他们所掌握的所有工具。这些神灵简直可以在一夜之间改变历史的进程。",
	"The actions of the gods generally do not happen often at the cosmic level (thankfully), but more through the mortals who worship them. Conflicts like this are nothing new and have been around for eons. No one truly knows the motivations of the gods at any given time, but this is how characters can be conduits for their deities of choice and carry out their plans in your world.": "诸神的行动一般不经常发生在宇宙层面（感谢），而更多地是通过崇拜他们的凡人来进行。像这样的冲突并不新鲜，已经存在了好几个世纪。没有人真正知道诸神在任何时候的动机，但这就是角色如何成为他们所选择的神灵的渠道，并在你的世界中实施他们的计划。",
	"Fight for your god. Defend the name of your goddess. Dispatch all known enemies in the name of your chosen deity. Your characters have a higher purpose which will inevitably clash with others in the world. What better way to seek adventure and spread the word of your god or goddess? You now have many more options, so have fun on the journey.": "为你的神而战。捍卫你的女神之名。以你选择的神的名义派遣所有已知的敌人。你的角色有一个更高的目标，这将不可避免地与世界上的其他人发生冲突。还有什么更好的方法来寻求冒险和传播你的神或女神的话语？你现在有了更多的选择，请在旅途中享受乐趣。",

Anansi can specify a simple and general course of action such as \"attack that creature,\" \"run over there,\" or \"fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from Anansi, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.": "任何在阿南希视线范围内的单一生物都必须尝试一个{@dc 24}智慧救赎动作。拯救失败后，目标会对阿南西友好，并被强迫听从他的指令。当目标是如此（%1%）时，阿南西与它有心灵感应的联系，只要两者在同一平面上。阿南西可以在他有意识的时候利用这种心灵感应的联系向生物发出命令（不需要任何行动），它也会尽力服从。阿南斯可以指定一个简单而笼统的行动方案，如 \"攻击那个生物\"、\"跑过去 \"或 \"取回那个物体\"。如果该生物完成了命令，并且没有收到阿南西的进一步指示，它就会尽其所能地防御和保护自己。",
	"The affected creature is {@condition charmed} for up to 1 minute. Anansi can charm one evil creature per round, up to a maximum of eight creatures.": "受影响的生物会被（%0%），最多1分钟。阿南西每回合可以魅惑一个邪恶的生物，最多可以魅惑八个生物。",
	"On a successful save, the creature takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) radiant damage, but it is immune to the charm effect for 24 hours.": "拯救成功后，该生物会受到10({@damage 3d6})的辐射伤害，但它在24小时内对魅惑效果免疫。",
	"Anansi can magically teleport himself or any willing target that he can see, along with any equipment being worn or carried, to any unoccupied space within five miles.": "阿南斯可以用魔法将自己或他能看到的任何自愿的目标，连同所穿戴或携带的任何设备，传送到五英里内任何无人的空间。",
	"spider, spider web": "蜘蛛，蜘蛛网",
	"chaotic neutral": "混乱的中性",
	"Anansi is a trickster and the keeper of all knowledge and stories. He takes the form of a spider and spins giant webs in the forest. There, he catches all of the stories from people's dreams and gossip. Anansi sometimes keeps the stories for himself, but other times he shares the knowledge with the world so they might become wise.": "阿南斯是个捣蛋鬼，是所有知识和故事的守护者。他以蜘蛛的形式出现，在森林中织出巨大的网。在那里，他从人们的梦中和闲谈中捕捉到所有的故事。阿南斯有时为自己保留这些故事，但有时却与世人分享这些知识，使他们成为聪明人。"
