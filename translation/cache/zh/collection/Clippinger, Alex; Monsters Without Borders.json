": "{@b Spell Turning}. 经过多次实验，矮人终于成功地给黑布丁注入了法术反射效果。这是通过给黑布丁喂食几十个法术转动的环来实现的。最终，黑布丁吸收了这些魔法环的效果。现在，如果有人对这些乌兹施法，诅咒就有可能直接反射到施法者身上。",
	"{@b Highly Flammable}. One of the oozes biggest flaws, which remained unnoticed by its dwarven creators, is that it is incredibly likely to catch fire. Although the ooze itself resists the damage, they can catch alight from the smallest spark, turning a corridor decorated with tapestries and rugs to a smoldering waste in a matter of moments. This feature has been exploited by canny adventurers, who set them alight from afar to cause distractions.": "{@b Highly Flammable}. 渗出物最大的缺陷之一是它非常容易着火，而矮人的创造者却没有注意到这一点。虽然渗出物本身可以抵御破坏，但它们可以被最小的火星点燃，使装饰着挂毯和地毯的走廊在瞬间变成一片燃烧的废墟。狡猾的冒险家们利用了这一特性，从远处点燃它们以分散注意力。",

It appears as a spherical crustacean, roughly eight feet across, with thick chitinous plates covering its bulk.
