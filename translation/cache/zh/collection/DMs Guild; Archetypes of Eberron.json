Your Wild Surge cannot increase the effective level of a spell beyond 9th level.": "从一阶开始，你学会了激发狂暴的情感，这可以增强你的力量--或者压倒它们。在你的回合中，你可以在施放1级或以上的巫师法术时，掷出一个{@dice d6}，即你的狂野涌动骰子。在掷出2或更高的分数时，你可以像从比你所消耗的法术槽大一级的法术槽中施放该法术。如果你掷出1，你就失败了，并被不断上升的情绪潮水所征服；你的法术没有被施放，法术槽没有被使用，而且你的状态是（%1%），直到你下一个回合开始。你的狂暴突进不能使一个法术的有效等级超过9级。",
	"Your Wild Surge die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a {@dice d8} at 11th level, and a {@dice d10} at 17th level.": "当你在这个等级中达到一定的等级时，你的狂野突进模子会发生变化。在11级时模子会变成（%0%），在17级时变成（%1%）。",
	"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能的次数等于你的魅力修改器（最少一次）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得任何已消耗的使用次数。",
	"Beginning when you reach 6th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Wild Surges when you finish a short or long rest.": "从你达到6级开始，当你完成短期或长期休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的野性冲动的使用。",
	"Additionally, you learn to push yourself beyond your limits. You can Wild Surge even after you have expended all uses, but every time your Wild Surge die roll fails, you must step down to the next smaller Wild Surge die size (reducing the maximum number you can roll by 2) until you have completed a long rest, to a minimum die of a {@dice d2}. For example, if you are 6th level and have failed two or more Wild Surges after expending your uses, your Wild Surge die is a {@dice d2}.": "此外，你要学会超越自己的极限。即使你已经用完了所有的用法，你仍然可以进行狂暴突进，但是每次你的狂暴突进模子滚动失败，你必须降到下一个更小的狂暴突进模子大小（将你可以滚动的最大数量减少2），直到你完成一个长时间的休息，最低模子为（%0%）。例如，如果你是第6级，并且在消耗了你的使用次数后，有两次或更多的狂暴突击失败，你的狂暴突击模子是（%1%）。",
	"Starting at 6th level, chaotic psionic energies protect your mind from the telepathic probing of others. Unless you allow it, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means and creatures can't telepathically communicate with you. If a creature attempts to read your thoughts, it must make a Wisdom save against your sorcerer spell save DC or take a number of points of psychic damage equal to your sorcerer level.": "从6级开始，混乱的幻术能量可以保护你的思想不受他人的心灵感应的探究。除非你允许，否则你的思想不能被心灵感应或其他方式所读取，生物也不能与你进行心灵感应交流。如果一个生物试图读取你的思想，它必须对你的巫师法术救赎DC进行智慧救赎，否则就会受到与你的巫师等级相等的精神伤害点数。",

As a bonus action you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.": "在14级时，你获得了踏入世界间空间的能力，可以瞬间从一个点转移到另一个点。作为一个额外的动作，你可以神奇地传送到你能看到的无人的空间，最远可达60英尺。",

	"Unlike most warlocks, you didn't make a deal with a powerful mysterious patron. Rather, you found an elemental; perhaps it was already bound, perhaps you bound it yourself, or perhaps found the spark deep within your own spirit. Regardless of your methodology, you are the master of this relationship, and you take what you need from it without being at its beck and call.": "与大多数术士不同，你并没有与一个强大的神秘赞助人达成协议。相反，你找到了一个元素；也许它已经被束缚了，也许你自己束缚了它，或者也许在你自己的精神深处发现了火花。无论你采用何种方法，你都是这种关系的主人，你从它那里获取你所需要的东西，而不必听从它的召唤。",
	"The Sulatar drow of the Xen'drik jungles are true masters of the art of elemental binding, able to control bound fire elementals without need for a dragonmark. Binding a fire elemental to their soul is merely an extension of that ability.": "Xen'drik丛林中的Sulatar乌鸦是真正的元素束缚艺术大师，能够控制被束缚的火元素而不需要龙印。将火元素与他们的灵魂结合只是这种能力的一种延伸。",
	"Gnomes of Zilargo are also known to follow this path as a result of their own elemental binding skills, and though they lack the same fundamental connection as the Sulatar, they are far more varied in their elemental types.": "众所周知，齐拉尔戈的地精也因自己的元素绑定技能而走这条路，虽然他们缺乏与苏拉塔相同的基本联系，但他们的元素类型要多得多。",
	"Far more rarely, planetouched folks might have a deep, intrinsic connection to an outer plane that exemplifies an elemental as part of their very nature. Such creatures as genasi or tieflings of Fernia have a connection to the elements that's deeper even than the Sulatar, and their bond can reach depths that the drow of Xen'drik can only dream of.": "更少见的是，被行星包围的人可能与一个外太空有深层次的内在联系，将元素作为他们本性的一部分。像费尔尼亚的玄武者或铁弗林这样的生物，与元素的联系甚至比苏拉塔更深，他们的联系可以达到Xen'drik的乌鸦所能梦想的深度。",

	"At 1st level, your soul is bound to the powers of an element. Choose an elemental damage type: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. This type is your elemental affinity, and once selected, it cannot be changed. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, or lighting damage, you can choose for it to deal your elemental affinity type instead.": "一级时，你的灵魂与一种元素的力量结合。选择一种元素伤害类型：酸、冷、火或闪电。这种类型是你的元素亲和力，一旦选定就不能改变。当你施放一个造成酸、冷、火或照明伤害的法术时，你可以选择让它代替你的元素亲和力类型。",
	"Additionally, the elemental affinity you choose grants you benefits as listed on the Elemental Affinity table. You learn a cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you but does not count against your number of warlock cantrips known. In addition, you gain proficiency in a skill, and you have advantage on all ability checks you make with that skill.": "此外，你选择的元素亲和力会赋予你元素亲和力表上所列的好处。你学会了一个咒语，对你来说这算作一个术士咒语，但不计入你已知的术士咒语数量。此外，你获得了一项技能的熟练度，你在使用该技能进行的所有能力检查中都有优势。",
	"Lightning": "閃電",
	"Starting at 6th level, you can attune yourself and flow through the elements that permeate the planes. As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 30 feet. Immediately before and after you teleport, every creature in a 5-foot radius of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes a number of points of damage of your elemental affinity type equal to half of your warlock level.": "从第6级开始，你可以调整自己，并在渗透到各个星球的元素中流动。作为一个额外的动作，你可以传送到30英尺。在你传送之前和之后，你周围5英尺范围内的每一个生物都必须对你的术士法术救赎做出灵巧的判断。如果救赎失败，生物会受到相当于你术士等级一半的元素亲和力类型的伤害点数。",
	"At 6th level, you can channel more power from the elemental you have mastered. Warlock spells that you cast ignore resistance to damage of your elemental affinity type.": "在6级时，你可以从你掌握的元素中引导更多的力量。你所施展的术士法术会忽略对你元素亲和力类型的伤害的抵抗。",
	"At 14th level, warlock spells you cast treat immunity to your elemental affinity type as resistance.": "在14级时，你施展的术士法术将对你的元素亲和力类型的免疫视为抵抗。",
	"Starting at 10th level, your long exposure has gifted you with traits normally associated with elementals. You gain resistance to poison damage and to your elemental affinity type. If you were already resistant to your affinity type as a racial feature, you instead gain immunity to your elemental affinity type.": "从10级开始，你的长期接触使你具有通常与元素相关的特质。你获得对毒药伤害和你的元素亲和力类型的抗性。如果你已经对你的亲和力类型有抵抗力作为种族特征，你将获得对你的元素亲和力类型的免疫力。",

	"Beginning at 14th level, your elemental power overflows from your very being. When you cast a spell that deals damage of your elemental affinity type, you create a number of elemental motes equal to your Charisma modifier that circle your body for 1 minute or until you cause them to explode. You can use a bonus action to move a mote up 40 feet and cause it to explode, dealing 4d6 points of damage of your elemental affinity type to all creatures within 5 feet of the mote.": "从14级开始，你的元素力量从你的本体中溢出。当你施展一个造成你元素亲和力类型伤害的法术时，你会创造出与你的魅力修饰值相等的元素微尘，这些微尘在你的身体上环绕1分钟，或者直到你使它们爆炸。你可以使用一个额外的动作，将一个摩特移动到40英尺外，并使其爆炸，对摩特周围5英尺内的所有生物造成4d6点你的元素亲和力类型的伤害。",

	"Anyone could be an agent of one of the Hidden Ones—the baker down the street, the savvy Cannith tinker who comes to your village every month or two, or the noble lord's daughter, eyes burning with curiosity.

However, the innocuous figure of a servant or simple guard is easily ignored, and their ranks might include a warlock of the Hidden One, with eyes ever-open.": "任何人都有可能成为隐者之一的代理人--街边的面包师、每隔一两个月就来你村子的精明的坎尼斯工匠，或者贵族老爷的女儿，眼睛里燃烧着好奇心。隐者的术士可能因为他们的重要地位而被选中，他们的影响力可以通过看似微不足道的行动改变国家。然而，仆人或简单卫兵的无害形象很容易被忽视，他们的队伍中可能包括隐者术士，眼睛永远是睁着的。",

	"Starting at 1st level, you acknowledge that your patron chose you for your cunning mind, not your social skills. Intelligence becomes your warlock spellcasting ability, instead of Charisma. Any warlock class feature that usually uses your Charisma modifier now uses your Intelligence modifier instead. Additionally, instead of gaining proficiency in Charisma saving throws as a warlock class feature, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws.": "从1级开始，你承认你的资助人选择你是因为你的狡猾的头脑，而不是你的社交能力。智力成为你的术士法术能力，而不是魅力。任何通常使用你的魅力修改器的术士类特征现在都使用你的智力修改器。此外，你不再像术士类特征那样获得熟练的魅力投掷，而是获得熟练的智力投掷。",
	"At 1st level, you have keen insight into the targets of your spells. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against a warlock spell you cast of 1st level or higher, you learn your choice of the creature's highest or lowest saving throw and its value. As a reaction, you can more closely read the threads of Prophecy woven into it, choosing to either learn all of the creature's condition immunities, or to learn all of its damage resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities.": "1级时，你对你的法术目标有敏锐的洞察力。每当一个生物对你施放的1级或以上的术士法术的蓄力失败时，你就会了解你所选择的该生物的最高或最低蓄力及其数值。作为反应，你可以更仔细地阅读编织在其中的预言之线，选择学习该生物的所有条件免疫，或者学习它的所有伤害抵抗、免疫和脆弱性。",

On a failed save, it is {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.": "从10级开始，你的守护者向你展示了恐惧的真正含义，但你已经学会了如何接受它，然后把它反过来对付它的制造者。你对被{@condition frightened}免疫。此外，作为对试图吓唬你的生物的反应，你可以把恐惧转嫁到它身上，使该生物对你的术士法术救赎DC做出智慧救赎。如果救赎失败，它将在1分钟内对你产生1%的恐惧，或者直到它受到任何伤害。",
	"Starting at 14th level, you can unleash a magical wave of pure knowledge to overwhelm the minds of lesser beings. As an action, you can cause up to five creatures within 30 feet of you to make an Intelligence saving throw.

	"You share a far closer bond with your patron that most warlocks dream of. You have either bound yourself to a single mighty spirit of a long-dead warrior, or to a gestalt force of mighty warriors. You are guided by your patron and instructed in the ways of war and combat, especially single combat. The Tairnadal of Aerenal and Valenar are by far the most common source of Soulborn warlocks, their patron ancestor guiding and acting through them.

You can use your choice of Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll, and on a hit, you deal slashing damage equal to {@damage 1d4} + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + psychic damage equal to twice the level of the spell you cast that turn.": "你在反常的第三条肢体上长出了一个甲壳质的脊柱，让人联想到螳螂的样子。这个肢体可以像你自己的肢体一样被轻易控制，有效地给了你第三只手。此外，如果你施法时，你的镰刀状肢体没有握住任何东西，你可以使用一个额外动作，用它的脊柱进行一次近战武器攻击。你可以使用你选择的力量或灵巧来进行攻击，一旦命中，你会造成相当于（%0%）+你的力量或灵巧修饰值的砍伤+相当于你那一回合所施法术等级两倍的精神伤害。",
	"Starting at 6th level, your body begins to excrete a thin, nearly transparent layer of mucus. You have advantage on checks and saving throws against being {@condition grappled} or {@condition restrained}. In addition, this slime is psionically active, and any creature who attempts to grapple or restrain you must make a Wisdom save or be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened} of you (your choice) for 1 minute, or until it takes damage.": "从6级开始，你的身体开始排出一层薄薄的、几乎透明的粘液。你对被{@condition grappled}或{@condition restrained}的检查和蓄力攻击有优势。此外，这种粘液是有灵性的，任何试图抓取或束缚你的生物都必须进行智慧救赎，否则会被你（%2%）或（%3%）（你选择）1分钟，或直到它受到伤害。",

	"At 14th level, you can summon a creature from beyond common understanding. You add the {@spell conjure aberrations|ArchEb} spell to your spellbook. This is a wizard spell for you.

Numerous studies have been attempted in the short years since the Mourning in hopes of studying its effects, discovering its cause, and determining if it's reversible... or possible to tame.": "哀悼让霍尔韦尔的人们感到恐惧和着迷。在哀伤发生后的短短几年里，人们尝试了许多研究，希望能研究它的影响，发现它的原因，并确定它是否可逆......或是否可能被驯服。",
	"The School of Living Spells makes a special study of how magic has gone awry in the Mournland. These wizards' expertise is on how the Day of Mourning affected magic cast on that day, turning spells into constructs of trapped magical energy. These wizards have discovered how to create a living spell of their own, small enough to tame, yet holding enormous potential within.": "活体法术学校对魔法在哀伤之地如何出错进行了专门研究。这些巫师的专长是研究哀悼日如何影响当天施放的魔法，将法术变成被困的魔法能量的构造。这些巫师发现了如何创造一个属于他们自己的活生生的法术，小到可以驯服，但内部却蕴藏着巨大的潜力。",
	"Lucia ir'Brenith, a Cyran refugee living in New Cyre, is the mother of this movement, and her lab has become a haven for anyone wishing to study the Mournland and living spells in particular.

	"When you dedicate yourself to this school at 2nd level, you add the {@spell find familiar} spell to your spellbook and have the option to create a living cantrip as a variant familiar. This familiar is a semi-sentient spell formed from your own arcane power. When you cast the {@spell find familiar} spell to create a living cantrip, you can do so without material components.": "当你在2级时献身于这一学派时，你将{@spell find familiar}的法术添加到你的法术书中，并可以选择创建一个活的咒语作为变异的熟悉。这个熟悉者是一个由你自己的奥术力量形成的半有生命的咒语。当你施展{@spell find familiar}的法术来创造一个活的咒语时，你可以不使用物质成分。",
	"When you cast any spell, regardless of its range, your {@creature living cantrip familiar|ArchEb} can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, you must be able to see it, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

	"When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn to imbue more powerful spells into your {@creature living cantrip familiar|ArchEb}. Starting at 5th level, when you finish a short or long rest, you can expend a spell slot of a level indicated on the Imbued Living Spell Familiar table to imbue your {@creature living cantrip familiar|ArchEb} with a damage dealing spell of that level that has a casting time of 1 action and requires no costly material component. When you do so, your familiar transforms into a more powerful living spell with full hit points, as indicated on the Imbued Living Spell Familiar table. While in this form, it gains the ability to take the Attack action on its turn, unlike other familiars. You can use your reaction on the familiar's turn to command it to cast the spell you imbued in it at its lowest level, using your wizard spell save DC and attack bonus instead of its own. (Instructions for customizing stat blocks for each type of familiar are provided in the section on \"Customizing Living Spell Familiars\".

	"When imbued with a spell, your familiar keeps this form until it casts the spell imbued in it, takes a long rest, or drops to 0 hit points, then it reverts to its normal living cantrip form, returning to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. However, if it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. If the spell it cast with Unleash Spell requires concentration, your familiar must maintain concentration on the spell once in living cantrip form.": "当被施以法术时，你的熟人会一直保持这种形态，直到它施以法术、长时间休息或下降到0命中率为止，然后它就会恢复到正常的活体咒语形态，恢复到它变身前的命中率数字。然而，如果它是因为下降到0命中率而恢复的，任何多余的伤害都会延续到它的正常形态。如果它用 \"释放法术 \"施放的法术需要集中注意力，那么你的熟悉者一旦进入活体咒语形态，就必须保持对该法术的注意力。",

	"Replace the effect of Unleash Spell with the effect of the chosen spell.

After the living spell familiar uses its Unleash Spell ability, it ceases to be a living spell familiar and reverts to its living cantrip familiar form, as described in your Living Spell Familiar feature.": "用所选法术的效果取代释放法术的效果。如果该法术需要蓄力或攻击卷，则使用你的巫师法术蓄力DC和攻击加成，而不是熟悉的人自己的。在活体法术熟悉者使用其释放法术的能力之后，它就不再是活体法术熟悉者，而是恢复到活体咒语熟悉者的形态，正如你的活体法术熟悉者特征中所描述的那样。",
	"For example, if you turn {@spell fireball} (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell familiar, you are creating a lesser living spell and should customize the {@creature living lightning bolt familiar|ArchEb}.

	"Also at 2nd level, your living cantrip familiar develops a taste for your spells. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot while you are within 30 feet of your living cantrip familiar to restore a number of hit points to it equal to {@dice 1d10} per level of the spell slot expended + your Intelligence modifier.

	"When you are holding the dragonshard, you can use an action to expend a charge from it and cast the spell at its lowest level, requiring no verbal or material components.

These charges last until expended or until you finish a long rest, after which time the magic of the living spell dissipates.": "当你持有龙石时，你可以使用一个行动从它身上消耗一个电荷，并以其最低的等级施展法术，不需要口头或物质成分。你所捕获的活体法术的法术等级决定了龙石所拥有的充能数量，如捕获的活体法术表中所示。这些电荷一直持续到耗尽或你完成长时间的休息，之后活体法术的魔法就会消散。",
	"Additionally, if you encounter a living spell in the wild that is within 30 feet of you, and you have a Khyber dragonshard worth at least 250 gp that does not already have another creature bound inside it, you can use an action to cause the wild living spell to make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the wild living spell is imprisoned within the dragonshard, and the dragonshard gains a number of charges as shown on the Captured Living Spell table. Once you have imprisoned a wild living spell, you can expend charges to cast the spell that it is made of, following the same rules for a living spell you captured in a dragonshard using this feature.": "此外，如果你在野外遇到一个在你30英尺范围内的活体法术，而你有一个价值至少250金币的开伯尔龙石，并且它里面还没有其他生物被束缚，你可以使用一个行动来使这个野生活体法术对你的巫师法术保全DC进行一个魅力救赎。如果救赎失败，野生生物咒语就会被囚禁在龙石中，而龙石会获得一定数量的收费，如捕获的生物咒语表所示。一旦你禁锢了一个野生的活体法术，你就可以花费费用来施放它所构成的法术，这与你用此特性在龙石中捕获的活体法术的规则相同。"
