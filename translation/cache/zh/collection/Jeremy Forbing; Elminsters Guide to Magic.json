	"You can convert levels of spell energy stored in your ward to cast spells you have prepared or know, creating new spell slots from the stored energy rather than using slots of your own. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own highest-level spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels of spell energy in place of your own spell slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal.

Servants can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and so forth. They have an effective Strength score of 2 (so they can carry 30 pounds, and push, drag, or lift 60 pounds). They can trigger traps and such, but they can exert only 60 pounds of force, and that is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. A servant's speed is 15 feet.": "仆人可以在宴会上提供食物或酒，帮助挖土方，划船，充当搬运工，叠衣服，或在农民的田地里帮忙。每个仆人一次只能进行一项活动，但如果被要求这样做，它就会不断重复同一活动。这使你可以命令一个仆人执行一项重复性的任务，然后如果你仍在范围内，就把注意力转移到其他地方。仆人只能打开普通的门、抽屉、盖子，等等。他们的有效力量得分是2（所以他们可以搬运30磅，推、拖、举60磅）。他们可以触发陷阱之类的东西，但他们只能施加60磅的力量，而这不足以激活某些压力板和其他装置。仆人的速度是15英尺。",
	"The servants cannot attack in any way, and are never allowed to make an attack roll. The servants have an Armor Class of 10 and 6 hit points.
