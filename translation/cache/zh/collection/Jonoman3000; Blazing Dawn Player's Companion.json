	"Volcani mature quickly, often reaching adulthood by the age of 10. After reaching adulthood, their remaining lifespan is highly variable, and completely unpredictable, as they show no more signs of aging.

On average, they live less than 50 years.": "沃尔卡尼成熟得很快，通常在10岁时就达到成年。成年后，它们的剩余寿命变化很大，而且完全不可预测，因为它们不再有衰老的迹象。火山人可以在20岁时自然死亡，尽管有些可以活到80岁。平均而言，它们的寿命不到50年。",

They are reliable allies, and ease into both leader and follower roles.": "沃尔卡尼人通常是善良的，尽管许多人是中立的。他们寻求做善事，并且一般都能很好地合作。他们的社会有些规范，对传统的坚持使他们具有合法的倾向。他们是可靠的盟友，可以轻松扮演领导者和追随者的角色。",

	"Volcani are a rare, ancient people, first born of primordial fire in an age long past. They live in places seldom traveled to by other races—volcanic mountain ranges and island chains, too hot for most other creatures to stand. But within these lands volcanus society thrives, as they build impressive structures and fortresses from igneous rock, with streams of lava flowing between and around their settlements like rivers. Volcani are highly driven, and many can accomplish great feats during their short lives that many of the longer lived races wouldn't even consider.": "沃尔卡尼是一个罕见的古老民族，在很久以前的一个时代，他们最初由原始的火诞生。他们生活在其他种族很少去的地方--火山山脉和岛链，太热了，大多数其他生物无法忍受。但在这些土地上，火山社会蓬勃发展，因为他们用火成岩建造了令人印象深刻的结构和堡垒，熔岩流像河流一样在他们的定居点之间和周围流淌。火山人有很强的驱动力，许多人可以在他们短暂的生命中完成伟大的壮举，而许多寿命较长的种族甚至不会考虑。",
	"The primordial god of fire, Kossuth, forged the first volcani from the white-hot magma that flows within the outer edges of the Plane of Fire, which he molded and cooled into a humanoid shape that resembled his own divine image. Over many generations, the physical appearance of volcani has mellowed somewhat, and they have become less elemental and more humanoid. They typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, though they are heavier than humans of equivalent height. Their skin color ranges from a deep black to a lighter red, but the most common shades are lighter browns and greys, occasionally accented by streaks of red. Their eyes are often brown or grey, though shades of red, orange, and yellow are also common. Their hair, usually kept of medium length, tends to be of a similar shade to their skin color.": "原始火神科苏斯用流淌在火界外围的白热岩浆铸造了第一批火山人，他将其塑造成与自己的神圣形象相仿的人形，并将其冷却。经过许多代人的努力，伏尔加尼的体貌已经变得有些成熟，他们已经变得不那么像元素，而更像人。他们通常站在5到6英尺高的地方，尽管他们比同等身高的人类更重。他们的皮肤颜色从深黑色到浅红色不等，但最常见的色调是浅棕色和灰色，偶尔会有红色条纹点缀。他们的眼睛通常是棕色或灰色，但红色、橙色和黄色也很常见。他们的头发，通常保持中等长度，倾向于与他们的皮肤颜色相似的色调。",
	"A volcanus has a more elemental form that they can temporarily manifest, however. For short periods of time, a volcanus can unleash their inner elemental power, causing their eyes to become motes of elemental fire, as their skin darkens and takes on a metallic sheen. According to legend, this form was the natural form of the first volcani, and it only became temporary after many generations.": "然而，一个火山人有一个更多的元素形式，他们可以暂时表现出来。在很短的时间内，火山人可以释放他们内在的元素力量，使他们的眼睛成为元素之火的微粒，他们的皮肤变黑并呈现出金属光泽。根据传说，这种形态是第一批火山人的自然形态，经过许多代人的努力才成为暂时的。",
	"Kossuth made the volcani for a purpose. They were designed as his servants, driven to build to his specifications, fight for his causes, and exist as an extension of his will. And to this end they served him well, for a time. Kossuth's dealings on the material plane were short lived, however, and he eventually found himself without need of his volcani servants. So he left them to their own devices, abandoned upon the material plane while he returned to the Plane of Fire.": "科索斯制造沃尔卡尼是有目的的。他们被设计为他的仆人，被驱使按照他的规格建造，为他的事业而战，作为他意志的延伸而存在。为了这个目的，他们在一段时间内为他服务得很好。然而，科苏斯在物质层面的交易是短暂的，他最终发现自己不需要他的沃尔卡尼仆人。于是他把他们留给了自己的设备，在他回到火界的时候，他们被遗弃在物质界。",
	"Though their god had left them, the volcani lived on without him, transforming their drive to work for his purposes into a desire to better themselves. While their physical appearance has mellowed over the centuries, the same cannot be said about their determination. All volcani believe they were born for a reason, and they are always searching for the purpose they believe they must fulfill. When a volcanus finds their purpose, they either complete it or die trying. For a volcanus, there is no such thing as procrastination or giving up.": "虽然他们的神已经离开了他们，但沃尔卡尼人在没有神的情况下继续生活，将他们为神的目的工作的动力转化为改善自己的愿望。虽然几个世纪以来，他们的身体外表已经变得成熟，但他们的决心却不能这么说。所有火山人都相信他们出生是有原因的，他们一直在寻找他们认为必须实现的目的。当一个火山人找到他们的目的时，他们要么完成它，要么死而后已。对于一个火山人来说，没有拖延或放弃这回事。",
	"A volcanus' soul is like a flickering flame—bright and full of life, up until the moment it's snuffed out. Moreso than any other race, a volcanus' lifespan is uncertain. After reaching adulthood, a volcanus shows no more signs of aging, and can die a natural death at any point thereafter. Some might die as early as 20 years old, while others might live to the age of 80. The volcani believe that their lifespan is tied to their innate purpose—when they complete that purpose, death is surely just around the corner.": "火山人的灵魂就像一团闪烁的火焰--明亮而充满生机，直到它被扼杀的那一刻。比起任何其他种族，火山人的寿命是不确定的。成年后，火山人不再显示出衰老的迹象，并可能在此后的任何时间自然死亡。有些人可能早在20岁就死了，而其他人可能活到80岁。火山人相信，他们的寿命与他们与生俱来的目的有关--当他们完成这一目的时，死亡肯定就在不远处。",
	"But for a volcanus, death isn't truly the end. Death merely signals the beginning of the next generation. When a volcanus dies, their body burns to ash—colored a deep black for males and a vibrant red for females. It is from this ash that a volcanus' children are born. By taking some of the ash of an adult male volcanus, combining it with some of the ash of an adult female volcanus, and using fresh lava to set that mixture ablaze, a new volcanus is born after the flames subside. A pair of two volcani has enough ash to sire four children, but most couples only sire two or three. The memories of a volcanus are in part passed down to their children, who often see the memories of their parents in vivid dreams. These memories can also give a volcanus a natural aptitude in the skills their parents knew.": "但是对火山来说，死亡并不是真正的结束。死亡只是预示着下一代的开始。当火山人死亡时，他们的身体会燃烧成灰烬，雄性的颜色为深黑色，雌性的颜色为鲜艳的红色。火山人的孩子正是从这些灰烬中诞生的。通过提取成年男性火山人的一些灰烬，与成年女性火山人的一些灰烬相结合，并使用新鲜的熔岩来点燃这种混合物，在火焰消退后，一个新的火山人就诞生了。一对两个火山人有足够的火山灰来孕育四个孩子，但大多数夫妇只孕育两个或三个。火山人的记忆部分地传给了他们的孩子，他们经常在生动的梦中看到他们父母的记忆。这些记忆也可以使火山人在他们父母所知道的技能方面有一种自然的能力。",
	"The unique reproductive system of volcani, combined with their uncertain lifespans, makes it common for a volcanus to plan for their death early in life. It is almost considered a coming of age ceremony for a young adult volcanus to write their first will. A volcanus' will generally specifies what is to be done with their material possessions, like the wills of other races, but more importantly it specifies what should be done with their ashes. Married volcani will typically create joint wills, stating potential names for their future children, and how many children they wish to have. Unmarried volcani are expected to donate their ashes their community, so that they might be used for adoption purposes. Another oddity of volcanus culture is the creation of a personal urn, which a volcanus either commissions or forges themself. These urns are heavily decorated with symbols telling the life story the volcanus they were made for, and are used to hold and transport a volcanus' ashes upon their death.": "火山人独特的生殖系统，加上他们不确定的寿命，使得火山人通常在生命的早期就为自己的死亡做计划。对于年轻的成年火山人来说，写下他们的第一份遗嘱几乎被认为是一种成年仪式。火山人的遗嘱通常指定如何处理他们的物质财产，就像其他种族的遗嘱一样，但更重要的是它指定了应该如何处理他们的骨灰。已婚的伏尔加尼人通常会订立联合遗嘱，说明他们未来孩子的潜在名字，以及他们希望有多少个孩子。未婚的伏尔加尼人要把他们的骨灰捐给他们的社区，这样他们就可以用于收养。火山人文化的另一个奇特之处在于创造个人骨灰盒，火山人要么委托他人，要么自己锻造。这些骨灰盒上装饰着大量的符号，讲述着为其制作的火山人的生活故事，并在火山人死后用来盛放和运送其灰烬。",
	"Volcani live in small communities on the outskirts of active volcanoes, where they construct impressive stone buildings and complex roadways. The members of a volcanus community are expected to help the other members of their community, particularly in fulfilling their wills. Many volcani have jobs as caretakers, where they are tasked with raising the children of past community members. Some volcani are \"seekers,\" a job where they are tasked with finding and recovering the ashes of those that died in the field, so that those ashes can be brought back to the community and used as that volcanus' will specified. There are also many adventurers among the volcani, as the desire to find their purpose leads many volcani to travel and perform great deeds, such as hunting down a deadly monster, fighting against oppressive regimes, or otherwise helping those in need.": "沃尔卡尼人生活在活火山外围的小社区，他们在那里建造令人印象深刻的石头建筑和复杂的道路。火山人社区的成员被期望帮助他们社区的其他成员，特别是在完成他们的遗愿方面。许多火山人的工作是看护人，他们的任务是抚养过去社区成员的孩子。有些火山人是 \"寻找者\"，他们的任务是寻找和恢复那些在野外死亡的人的骨灰，以便将这些骨灰带回社区，并按照该火山人的意愿使用。火山人中也有许多冒险家，因为寻找自己目的的愿望导致许多火山人去旅行和执行伟大的事迹，如追捕致命的怪物，与压迫性政权斗争，或以其他方式帮助有需要的人。",
	"As volcani couples are forced to choose their child's names before they can know their gender, volcani names are typically gender-neutral. They also lack true family names—a volcanus' last name is traditionally their father's first name, followed by their mother's first name, separated by a dash.": "由于伏尔加尼夫妇被迫在知道孩子的性别之前选择他们的名字，伏尔加尼的名字通常是中性的。他们也缺乏真正的姓氏--火山人的姓氏传统上是他们父亲的名字，后面是他们母亲的名字，中间用破折号分开。",
	"Aldebrand, Azar, Cinaed, Fiamett, Fintan, Flann, Hurik, Ignati, Phoenix, Pyrrhus, Shula, Uriah, Uriel": "Aldebrand, Azar, Cinaed, Fiamett, Fintan, Flann, Hurik, Ignati, Phoenix, Pyrrhus, Shula, Uriah, Uriel",
	"Strong and proud, guardrins are the descendants of guardinal and human parents. They are touched by the divine power of elysium, a beautiful plane of rolling hills and flowering meadows that the mighty guardinals call home. Guardrins are not often born in this plane, however. They are usually born on the material plane, as the result of a guardinal traveling there during their missions to ward off evil. Once they come of age, guardrins are expected to take up the mantle of their celestial parent, and do their part in smiting evil and protecting those weaker than them. They are a noble race, as strong and graceful as the animals they resemble.": "强壮而骄傲，卫兵是卫兵和人类父母的后代。他们被elysium的神圣力量所触动，这是一个由起伏的山丘和开花的草地组成的美丽平面，强大的guardinals称之为家园。然而，卫兵并不经常出生在这个平面。他们通常出生在物质位面，是守护者在执行任务时前往那里抵御邪恶的结果。一旦他们成年，守卫者被期望接过他们天人父母的衣钵，在打击邪恶和保护比他们弱小的人方面尽自己的职责。他们是一个高贵的种族，像他们所喜欢的动物一样强壮和优雅。",
	"A guardrin's appearance takes after its guardinal parent, granting it an animalistic form similar to that of a true guardinal. Like their celestial parents, the degree of animalism in their appearance varies greatly. Some guardrins look like humans, but with a light covering of fur over parts of their bodies, and a few distinguishing features like horns, claws, or fangs. Other guardrins more closely resemble animals, and look just like beasts that have learned to walk on two legs and wear clothing.": "守护神的外表是以其守护神的父母为原型，赋予其与真正的守护神相似的动物性形态。就像他们的天人父母一样，他们外表的动物化程度差异很大。有些守卫者看起来像人类，但在他们身体的某些部位覆盖了一层轻薄的皮毛，还有一些明显的特征，如角、爪子或獠牙。其他护卫者更像动物，看起来就像已经学会用两条腿走路和穿衣服的野兽。",
	"Guardrins are typically tall and muscular, though their exact height varies among their different varieties. More human-like guardrins are usually beautiful to behold, and even the more animalistic ones resemble only the most magnificent members their corresponding species. Even the most beastial members typically hold some resemblance to their human parent, such as a shared eye color, hair color, or other identifying feature.": "守卫者通常是高大的，肌肉发达，尽管他们的确切高度在不同的品种中有所不同。更像人类的卫兵通常是美丽的，甚至更像动物的卫兵也只像他们相应物种中最壮丽的成员。即使是最兽化的成员通常也与他们的人类父母有一些相似之处，如共同的眼睛颜色、头发颜色，或其他识别特征。",
	"Though guardrins are compassionate and gentle to their friends, they are merciless to all that commit evil. Their disposition can change quickly as the situation commands it, with calm tranquility quickly transitioning to blind anger when evil rears its ugly head. They have no qualms with killing those that have commited evil, especially those that have killed innocents.": "虽然护卫者对他们的朋友充满了同情和温柔，但他们对所有犯了罪的人都是无情的。他们的性格可以随着情况的变化而迅速改变，当邪恶出现的时候，平静的安宁会迅速过渡到盲目的愤怒。他们毫无顾忌地杀死那些犯了罪的人，特别是那些杀害无辜的人。",
	"When it comes to close friends and family, guardrins are fierce protectors and loving companions. They value these close connections above all else, and will fight to protect them even when they are clearly outmatched. When it comes to their friends, guardrins are selfless and willing to sacrifice their lives for them.": "当涉及到亲密的朋友和家人时，护卫者是凶猛的保护者和爱的伴侣。他们把这些亲密关系看得比什么都重要，即使他们明显处于劣势，也会奋力保护他们。当涉及到他们的朋友时，护卫者是无私的，愿意为他们牺牲自己的生命。",
	"When they come of age, guardrins typically leave home and wander the world, searching for those that would need their help and companionship, and rooting out evil wherever they find it. Guardrins have a natural inclination towards adventuring, and are usually quite good at it. Their strong sense of justice oftens leads them to become heroes, celebrated far and wide for their great deeds. They fight against oppression, dethrone tyrants, and become champions of moral causes.": "当他们成年后，守卫者通常会离开家，在世界范围内流浪，寻找那些需要他们帮助和陪伴的人，并在他们发现的地方铲除邪恶。守护者对冒险有一种天然的倾向，而且通常都很擅长冒险。他们强烈的正义感常常使他们成为英雄，因其伟大的事迹而广为人知。他们与压迫作斗争，推翻暴君，并成为道德事业的拥护者。",
	"Guardrins typically grow up with their non-celestial parent, and therefore use human naming conventions. They often have more atypical names, however, and might be given names themed around the beast they share features with.": "守护者通常与他们的非天人父母一起长大，因此使用人类的命名惯例。然而，他们往往有更多非典型的名字，并可能被赋予以他们共同特征的野兽为主题的名字。",
	"Hailing from the stars, as their name suggests, astrans are reclusive beings seldom seen by other races. They live on remote mountaintops or deserted islands, eking out a meager existence far from civilization. Few folk can claim to have met an astran, but those that do seldom forget the encounter. Their strange, mystifying appearance causes most other races to initially fear them, but their peaceful nature and penchant for wisdom makes them good friends of those that can get past the first impression.": "正如他们的名字一样，来自星星的天体人是隐居的生命，很少被其他种族看到。他们生活在偏远的山顶或荒芜的岛屿上，在远离文明的地方勉强维持生计。很少有人能说自己遇到过阿斯特拉人，但那些遇到过的人很少会忘记这次遭遇。他们奇怪而神秘的外表使大多数其他种族最初对他们感到恐惧，但他们和平的天性和对智慧的偏爱使他们成为那些能够克服第一印象的好朋友。",
	"Those that look upon an astran's peculiar features can tell that these creatures are not of this world. Although humanoid in form, an astran's appearance is off-putting. Their bodies are long and wiry, and their skin is the color of ash, accented by deep crimson hues. But their most unique feature is the shape of their head, which is characterized by a set of three tentacle-like protrusions from the back of their skull, as well as pairs of smaller protrusions set into their slender face.": "那些看到哮天犬奇特特征的人可以看出，这些生物不属于这个世界。虽然是人形，但阿斯特兰人的外表却让人不舒服。他们的身体细长，皮肤是灰的颜色，并带有深红色的色调。但他们最独特的特征是他们的头部形状，其特点是头骨后面有一组三个触手状的突起，以及一对较小的突起，镶嵌在他们细长的脸上。",
	"They are approximately 7 feet tall on average, though some can stand up to 8 and half feet tall. Despite their staggering height, astrans usually only weigh between 130 and 170 pounds. They have no hair on any part of their bodies. To the other races all astrans look quite similar. While other astrans can easily tell their kind apart, most others need to study their features for at least a few moments before coming to a conclusion. If in doubt, all astrans can be set apart by their uniquely colored eyes, which can take on nearly any color and often contain complex patterns that are as unique as fingerprints.": "他们平均身高约为7英尺，尽管有些人可以站到8.5英尺高。尽管他们的身高惊人，但哮天犬通常只有130至170磅重。他们身体的任何部位都没有毛发。对其他种族来说，所有的斯特兰人看起来都很相似。虽然其他天体人可以很容易地分辨出他们的种类，但大多数其他人需要研究他们的特征至少一会儿才能得出结论。如果有疑问，所有的天体人都可以通过他们颜色独特的眼睛来区分，他们的眼睛几乎可以呈现出任何颜色，而且经常包含复杂的图案，就像指纹一样独特。",
	"Astrans are also completely genderless, and therefore have no concept of ‘male' or ‘female.' Their bodies look male to most other races, however, and they are usually fine with being referred to as ‘he.'": "阿斯特拉人也是完全没有性别的，因此没有 \"男性 \"或 \"女性 \"的概念。然而，在大多数其他种族看来，他们的身体是男性的，他们通常可以接受被称为 \"他\"。",
	"Astrans are not born like other races. The rare, tiny embryos that eventually grow up into astrans can be found encased within meteorites. The origins of these meteorites is unknown—some believe that they are created by some celestial deity that casts down shooting stars from the heavens. Others believe that these meteorites are the destroyed remains of an ancient planet, still harboring sparks of life within its countless fragments.": "阿斯特拉人不像其他种族那样出生。最终成长为阿斯特兰人的罕见的、微小的胚胎可以在陨石中被发现。这些陨石的来源不明--有些人认为它们是由一些天神创造的，这些天神从天上投下流星。其他人则认为这些陨石是一个古老星球被摧毁的残骸，在其无数的碎片中仍然蕴含着生命的火花。",
	"After an astran meteorite lands, it behaves much like an egg. The astran embryo grows inside the meteorite, until it emerges a few weeks later as a tiny creature, only 1-2 feet tall. Astrans are capable of fending for themselves as soon as they emerge. They can protect themselves with their innate magical capabilities, and they know the astran language and basic survival skills from their inception. They grow quickly, reaching their full size in approximately 1-2 years.": "阿斯特兰人的陨石落地后，它的表现很像一个鸡蛋。阿斯特拉人的胚胎在陨石内生长，直到几周后作为一个小生物出现，只有1-2英尺高。阿斯特兰人一出现就有能力自食其力。他们可以用与生俱来的魔法能力保护自己，他们从一开始就懂得阿斯特兰语和基本的生存技能。他们长得很快，大约1-2年就能长到全尺寸。",
	"Even if young astrans are better equipped to survive alone than most humanoid young, the world is still an exceptionally dangerous place for a young astran. Some older astrans watch the night sky for shooting stars, and trek great distances to find where meteorites have landed. Through these treks they seek to find a meteorite that holds an astran embryo, so that the young astran might have a better chance of surviving to adulthood, and so that they might have a companion to ease their loneliness.": "即使年轻的天体人比大多数人形年轻人更有能力独自生存，但对于年轻的天体人来说，这个世界仍然是一个异常危险的地方。一些年长的天体人观察夜空中的流星，并长途跋涉去寻找陨石的落点。通过这些跋涉，他们试图找到一块承载着阿斯特兰人胚胎的陨石，这样年轻的阿斯特兰人可能有更好的机会存活到成年，这样他们可能有一个伙伴来缓解他们的孤独。",
	"Astrans often live for close to a millenia, and during their long lives little changes about them from a physical standpoint. The changes made by aging are subtle—typically their skin changes color, becoming darker and losing some of its luster, and the light of their eyes becomes slightly dimmer. These changes happen so slowly that they are nearly unnoticeable, however, and only similarly long lived races, like elves, would have a chance of noticing an astran's aging.": "阿斯特拉人的寿命通常接近一千年，在他们漫长的生命中，从身体的角度来看，他们的变化不大。衰老带来的变化是微妙的--通常他们的皮肤会改变颜色，变得更黑，失去一些光泽，眼睛的光线也会变得稍微暗淡一些。然而，这些变化发生得如此缓慢，以至于他们几乎无法察觉，而且只有类似的长寿种族，如精灵，才有机会注意到阿斯特兰人的衰老。",
	"The vast majority of astrans spend their long lives carefully avoiding long-lasting friendships, fearing the sadness that comes with watching their friends grow old as they, in turn, remain unchanged by the years. This fear often fades over time, and they might make friends with other long-lived races, particularly elves, once they have a few centuries behind them. While they tend to make their homes in places untraveled by other folk, they don't actively avoid other races when those folk happen upon their humble abodes, and in fact they often welcome their visitors inside and are eager to share their wisdom with individuals that would appreciate it. Born with innate knowledge, an astran's wisdom can sometimes be prophetic. Those that know of this trait may search far and wide for an astran that could act as an oracle.": "绝大多数天体人在漫长的生命中都会小心翼翼地避开长久的友谊，因为他们害怕看着朋友变老而产生的悲伤，因为他们反过来也会因为岁月的流逝而保持不变。这种恐惧往往随着时间的推移而消失，一旦他们有了几个世纪的时间，他们可能会与其他长寿的种族交朋友，特别是精灵。虽然他们倾向于将自己的家安在其他民族未曾涉足的地方，但当其他民族碰上他们简陋的住所时，他们也不会主动回避，事实上，他们经常欢迎他们的访客进入，并渴望与那些欣赏他们智慧的人分享他们的智慧。天生的知识，阿斯特兰人的智慧有时可以成为预言。那些知道这种特性的人可能会到处寻找可以充当神谕的阿斯特兰人。",
	"One of the few relationships that an astran is willing to take on with another race is that of a mentor-student relationship, where the astran imparts its knowledge and skill upon a worthy student. Even these associations are often short-lived, however, as they seek to not become too attached to their pupils.": "天体人愿意与其他种族建立的少数关系之一是师生关系，即天体人将其知识和技能传授给有价值的学生。然而，即使是这样的关系也往往是短暂的，因为他们力图不对他们的学生产生过多的依赖。",
	"While most astrans tend to stay put when they can help it, there are many points in their lives where they might take up adventuring. Some astrans are compelled to adventure when they take up students, as they seek to train them in real-life situations. Others might become unintentionally involved in worldly conflicts, if those conflicts reach their homesteads. Their typical kindness might make them protectors of refugees or escorts of travelers, where their involvement can easily rope them into greater adventures. Adventuring astrans tend to be the exception, rather than the rule, and may learn to make lasting friendships with their comrades.": "虽然大多数天体人在他们可以帮助的时候倾向于留在原地，但在他们的生活中，有很多时候他们可能会去冒险。有些天体人在带学生的时候就不得不去冒险，因为他们想在现实生活中训练他们。其他人可能无意中卷入世俗的冲突，如果这些冲突到达他们的家园。他们典型的善良可能使他们成为难民的保护者或旅行者的护卫者，他们的参与很容易使他们陷入更大的冒险。冒险的天体人往往是例外，而不是常规，他们可能学会与他们的同志建立持久的友谊。",
	"An astran chooses their own name shortly after they emerge from their meteorite. Since astrans are genderless, there are no ‘male' or ‘female' names for them. Their lack of true parents also means they lack a family name. An astran's real name, taken from the astran language, is often difficult for other races to pronounce. Therefore, astrans tend to translate these names into common when dealing with other races. A few of the common translations are listed below.": "一个天体人在从陨石中出来后不久就选择了自己的名字。由于天体人是无性别的，所以他们没有 \"男性 \"或 \"女性 \"的名字。他们没有真正的父母，这也意味着他们缺乏一个姓氏。天体人的真名取自天体人的语言，其他种族往往难以读出。因此，在与其他种族打交道时，星际人倾向于将这些名字翻译成普通话。下面列出了一些常见的翻译。",
	"Antlia, Aquila, Aries, Caelum, Cepheus, Circinus, Crux, Dorado, Equuleus, Fornax, Horologium, Hydrus, Leo, Libra, Monoceros, Orion, Pavo, Sculptor, Serpens, Tucana, Virgo, Volans.": "Antlia, Aquila, Aries, Caelum, Cepheus, Circinus, Crux, Dorado, Equuleus, Fornax, Horologium, Hydrus, Leo, Libra, Monoceros, Orion, Pavo, Sculptor, Serpens, Tucana, Virgo, Volans.",
	"The Courage domain focuses on personal heroics, and acts of valor and self-sacrifice. While the Courage domain bears many similarities to the War domain, it is more individualistic and isn't directly connected to war. Clerics of this domain often take part in smaller conflicts, and focus on personal battles over grandois wars. Many war-like deities can claim influence over this domain, however, including Torm, Heironeous, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah. Gods of endurance and loss, such as Ilmater and Shar, can claim some influence over this domain as well, as they promote courage in the face of hardship. Regardless of their patron deity, clerics of this domain make for heroic warriors, eager to face their fears and fight against the odds to achieve their goals.": "勇气领域的重点是个人英雄主义，以及英勇和自我牺牲的行为。虽然勇气领域与战争领域有许多相似之处，但它更加个人化，与战争没有直接联系。这个领域的神职人员经常参与较小的冲突，并专注于个人战斗而不是大的战争。然而，许多类似战争的神灵都可以宣称对这一领域有影响力，包括托尔姆、希罗尼斯、基里-乔利斯和多尔-阿拉。耐力和损失之神，如伊尔马特和沙尔，也可以要求对这一领域产生一些影响，因为他们提倡面对困难的勇气。无论他们的守护神是谁，这个领域的神职人员都是英勇的战士，渴望面对他们的恐惧，为实现他们的目标而与困难斗争。",

A charred creature receives half as many hit points from any healing, and if a charred creature within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to form the burning embers rising from its body into the fiery image of a phoenix. This phoenix rushes towards another creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target using your warlock spell attack modifier.

	"Starting at 6th level, you can momentarily don fiery wings in response to harm, allowing you to quickly escape your assailant while returning a blast of fire at them. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain these wings and then fly up to 60 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. The wings vanish at the end of the turn, causing you to fall if you end the turn in the air. Also, if the creature that damaged you was within 10 feet of you, it takes fire damage equal to half your warlock level.": "从6级开始，你可以在受到伤害时瞬间穿上火热的翅膀，让你迅速逃离攻击者，同时向他们回敬一束火焰。当你受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应来获得这些翅膀，然后在不引起机会攻击的情况下飞到60英尺。翅膀在回合结束时消失，如果你在空中结束回合，则会导致你坠落。另外，如果伤害你的生物在你10英尺范围内，它将受到相当于你术士等级一半的火焰伤害。",

	"While pyromancers are most well-known for their offensive capabilities, they are also capable of defending themselves. The flames they conjure can also come to their defense, rebuking attackers and thereby dissuading enemies from approaching them. Pyromancers are highly versatile, and not to be underestimated.": "虽然火法师最出名的是他们的进攻能力，但他们也有自卫的能力。他们召唤出的火焰也能为自己辩护，斥责攻击者，从而劝阻敌人不要接近他们。火法师的能力非常全面，不容小觑。",

Instead, you can have a number of lights equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1) at once. If you cast {@spell light} when you already have the maximum number of lights active, you choose one of the lights to dismiss. You can also dismiss a light using your bonus action. Lastly, you can choose to target a creature directly when you cast light.

	"At 6th level, whenever you cast {@spell light} and directly target a hostile creature, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to make the light more potent. You make this choice before the save is rolled, and if the creature fails its save, it is {@condition blinded} until the end of your next turn if you expended a slot of 1st level or higher.

They are quite unlike wizardly pyromancers, however, as they use this magic to become powerful front-line fighters rather than back-line mages.

Creating a pair of these magical gauntlets takes an hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest, and requires the use of {@item smith's tools|phb} and 30 gp of materials. Creating your first pair of gauntlets is free. The gauntlets are specially designed for your body, and are ineffective when used by other creatures. They are considered martial melee weapons with which you are proficient. They deal {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage on a hit, have the light property, and you use your Intelligence modifier for their attack and damage rolls.

This causes the target to take {@dice 3d6} additional fire or lightning damage, rather than {@dice 1d6}, and each creature in a 15-foot cone behind the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your artificer spell save DC, as heat is expelled from your gauntlets in a blast of energy.

	"There are many cultures, particularly in the harsh outlands that many barbarians call home, that revere the power of the sun. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Blazing Sun take this reverence a step further, and learn to how to transform and harness this power.

	"Some barbarians revere the celestial spirits that roam the lands and skies, and seek them out to be their guides and personal connection to the divine.
