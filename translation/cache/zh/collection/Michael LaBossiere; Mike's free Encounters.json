Upon expending this magic, the dagger turns to bone ash.": "如果你用这把匕首杀死一个小型或中型的人形物体，它就会变成一个{@creature skeleton|MM}由你控制的{@spell animate dead|PHB}的法术。耗尽这个魔法后，匕首会变成骨灰。",
	"While some versions of this weapon are simple daggers, others are elaborate works crafted as an act of devotion to a deity of the undead. While composed of bone, the ritual of creation makes a bone dagger as hard as forged steel.": "这种武器的某些版本是简单的匕首，而另一些则是精心制作的作品，作为对亡灵之神的一种奉献行为。虽然由骨头组成，但创造的仪式使骨质匕首像锻造的钢铁一样坚硬。",

	"If you examine the wine carefully, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the faint hint of decayed flesh tainting the wine. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the wine has signs of necromantic magic.

An {@spell identify|PHB} spell will reveal its true nature.": "如果你仔细检查这瓶酒，成功通过DC15智慧（感知）检查，就会发现酒里有一丝微弱的腐肉味。通过DC15智力（阿卡纳）检查，可以发现酒有亡灵魔法的迹象。在分析酒的过程中，成功通过DC10智力（炼金术士用品）检查，会发现它含有毒药和其他一些元素。一个{@spell identify|PHB}的法术将揭示它的真实性质。",
