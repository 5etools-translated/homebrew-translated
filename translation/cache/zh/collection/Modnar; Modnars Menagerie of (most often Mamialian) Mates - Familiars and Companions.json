	"In this supplement, we explore a new type of warlock: the caretaker archetype. Unlike the individuals who gain their powers by making a pact or exchange with a powerful entity, the caretaker warlock receives their powers by protecting their patron, which happens to be still an egg or a newborn legendary creature.": "在本补充资料中，我们将探索一种新的术士类型：看护者原型。与那些通过与强大的实体签订契约或交换来获得力量的人不同，看护者术士通过保护他们的守护者来获得力量，而他们的守护者恰好还是一个蛋或一个新生的传奇生物。",
	"This protection evolves into an intimate bond between the caretaker and their patron, allowing the player to explore a caring and nurturing relationship with its patron as the two grow in power together.": "这种保护会演变成看守人和他们的赞助人之间的亲密关系，让玩家在两者共同成长的过程中探索与赞助人之间的关怀和培养关系。",
	"In line with this supplement, we defined a number of creatures capable of being a patron;  they include the couatl, phoenix, and dragon turtle amid others. To some, this may run contrary with what is canon in the D&D universe and books like the Monster Manual. We argue that given the role and power these creatures held throughout various mythologies, these creatures could easily be viewed as creatures powerful enough to be patrons in their own right. This may require you to slightly alter their stats or even the mythology of your setting.": "根据这个补充文件，我们定义了一些能够成为守护者的生物；它们包括库拉特尔、凤凰和龙龟等等。对某些人来说，这可能与D&D宇宙和《怪物手册》等书籍中的正统内容相悖。我们认为，鉴于这些生物在各种神话中的作用和力量，这些生物可以很容易地被视为强大到足以成为赞助人的生物。这可能需要你略微改变它们的属性，甚至是你设定的神话。",
	"Caretakers love their companions and are devoted to their protection. The dream of a caretaker is to one day see their patron grow into the magnificent beast they are destined to be. Aside from that, the caretaker could have come from any walk of life, for it has now been changed forever.": "看守人热爱他们的同伴，并致力于保护他们。看护者的梦想是有一天看到他们的守护者成长为他们注定要成为的雄伟野兽。除此以外，看守人可以来自任何行业，因为现在已经被永远改变了。",
	"For the subclass version of the caretaker warlock, we don't specify whether you are protecting the egg or if the egg has already hatched. Mechanically they work the same, the patron is intended to work as a more narrative and personal role for the player, if the patron is attacked, it will share the same pool of hitpoints with their caretaker.": "对于子类版本的看守术士，我们没有说明你是在保护蛋还是蛋已经孵化了。从机制上讲，它们的工作原理是一样的，守护者的目的是作为玩家的一个更有叙事性的个人角色，如果守护者被攻击，它将与他们的看守者共享相同的命中率。",
	"When you want to create a character that is outside the normal character generation rules, it's always important to remember that you're engaging in a collaborative story told by you, the GM, and the rest of the party, and we encourage adaptability and flexibility. What is said here may apply to any homebrew or third-party class/variant that you may want to play. For Everyone: It is your game, your world, your character, your story. Everyone contributes to this story; don't hesitate to make changes, tweaks, and adjustments as you see fit. My words (as the creator) are not law, just ideas, interpretations and inspiration for you to use.": "当你想创建一个超出正常角色生成规则的角色时，重要的是要记住你是在参与一个由你、GM和其他成员共同讲述的合作故事，我们鼓励适应性和灵活性。这里所说的可能适用于任何你想玩的自制或第三方的等级/变体。对于每个人：这是你的游戏，你的世界，你的角色，你的故事。每个人都为这个故事做出了贡献；不要犹豫，在你认为合适的时候做出改变、调整。我的话（作为创作者）不是法律，只是供你使用的想法、解释和灵感。",
	"For Everyone:": "为大家服务。",
	"It is your game, your world, your character, your story. Everyone to this story; don't hesitate to make changes, tweaks, and adjustments as you see fit. My words (as the creator) are not law, just ideas, interpretations and inspiration for you to use.": "这是你的游戏，你的世界，你的角色，你的故事。每个人都对这个故事；不要犹豫，在你认为合适的时候进行修改、调整。我的话（作为创作者）不是法律，只是供你们使用的想法、解释和灵感。",
	"As the player:": "作为球员。",
	"Provide the GM with the class/variant you want to play, pitch the character concept and be flexible in building and exploring the character options with your GM.": "向GM提供你想玩的类别/变体，提出角色概念，并灵活地与GM一起建立和探索角色选项。",
	"As the GM:": "作为总经理。",
	"Try to work with your player's pitch and how can it work with the setting and story you think you'll be telling?": "试着与你的球员的投篮配合，如何能与你认为你要讲述的环境和故事配合？",
	"It's important to remember that despite the patron being the caretaker's companion, they do not work mechanically like an animal companion. A few things to emphasize:": "重要的是要记住，尽管赞助人是看守人的伙伴，但他们并不像动物伙伴那样机械地工作。有几件事要强调一下。",
	"{@b The GM controls the patron}. It makes the patron feel more independent from the player, providing a wider range of roleplay opportunities, as well as caretaking challenges.": "{@b The GM controls the patron}. 它使赞助人感觉更独立于玩家，提供更广泛的角色扮演机会，以及看管方面的挑战。",
	"{@b The patron is not intended to engage in combat}. Sure, times will emerge when the patron will attack or defend itself, but this companion is not considered to be a combat companion. This is also why we simplified its health mechanic.": "{@b The patron is not intended to engage in combat}. 当然，有时会出现守护者会攻击或自卫的情况，但这个同伴不被认为是战斗同伴。这也是我们简化其健康机制的原因。",
	"{@b Be careful when endangering the patron}. Doing this can obviously set up some great emotional and roleplay moments but, as all things, it can be overdone. It should never feel like the warlock is fighting constantly just to keep their patron alive. Rather, the majority of the focus should not be directly on the patron, unless you are doing so for story purposes.": "{@b Be careful when endangering the patron}. 这样做显然可以建立一些伟大的情感和角色扮演的时刻，但是，就像所有的事情一样，它可以被过度使用。它不应该让人觉得术士在不断战斗，只是为了让他们的守护者活着。相反，大部分的焦点不应该直接放在守护者身上，除非你是为了故事的目的而这么做。",
	"You found your patron for sale at a black market. When you became aware of one another the connection was instant. Did you purchase your patron or did you obtain them in another way?": "你发现你的赞助人在黑市上出售。当你们意识到彼此时，这种联系是瞬间的。你是购买了你的赞助人还是以其他方式获得了他们？",
	"While seeking shelter from a storm, you and the patron ended up in the same safe spot. You agreed to share the space while you waited out the storm. During the night, you two struck up a conversation and learned of one another's needs. You agreed to become warlock and patron, and the pair of you have worked together ever since.": "在寻求躲避暴风雨的时候，你和那位顾客最终在同一个安全的地方。你们同意在等待暴风雨来临的时候分享这个空间。在夜里，你们俩进行了交谈，了解了彼此的需求。你们同意成为术士和赞助人，从那时起，你们两人就一直在一起工作。",
	"The patron's parents became aggressive and had to be put down. You chose to adopt the creature instead of leaving it. Your relationship started off rocky. Has it smoothed out since then, or are things still tense at times?": "资助人的父母变得具有攻击性，不得不将其放下。你选择收养这个生物，而不是离开它。你们的关系开始时很不稳定。从那时起，你们的关系是否有所缓和，还是有时仍然很紧张？",
	"You found the patron's egg (or its infant form) in the lair of a spellcaster. It appeared as though the spellcaster was going to attempt a ritual on the egg before you defeated them. You cared for the egg and the creature imprinted on you.": "你在一个施法者的巢穴中发现了守护神的蛋（或其婴儿形态）。在你击败他们之前，施法者似乎要在蛋上尝试一种仪式。你照顾了这个蛋，这个生物在你身上留下了印记。",
	"On a starlit night in the wilds, you heard a lonesome song across the night air. When you found the source of this harrowing melody, you discovered the patron. What was your patron so forlorn about? Why did you decide to help it?": "在荒野中的一个星光灿烂的夜晚，你听到一首孤独的歌声穿过夜空。当你找到这首令人痛苦的旋律的来源时，你发现了守护者。你的守护者为何如此惆怅？为什么你决定帮助它？",
	"Your patron was being chased by other, larger creatures that wished to eat it. You intervened and saved them. Over the course of this battle you learned your own abilities were not enough. Your patron offered you a deal and you accepted, becoming their warlock.": "你的主顾被其他更大的生物追赶，希望吃掉它。你介入并救了他们。在这场战斗的过程中，你了解到自己的能力是不够的。你的守护者向你提出了一个交易，你接受了，成为他们的术士。",
	"An adult version of your patron appeared before you, juvenile patron by their side. They forced your patron upon you, insisting that you help raise it and become its servant. You survived because you agreed to their terms unconditionally.": "你的守护者的一个成人版本出现在你面前，少年守护者在他们身边。他们把你的守护者强加给你，坚持要你帮助养育它并成为它的仆人。你幸存下来是因为你无条件地同意了他们的条件。",
	"A friend of yours was the original warlock for your patron. Unfortunately, they died. Why did you become the patron's new warlock? Does the patron attempt to hide how desperately they miss your friend? How has this affected your relationship?": "你的一个朋友是你的赞助人的原始术士。不幸的是，他们死了。为什么你会成为赞助人的新术士？赞助人是否试图掩饰他们对你朋友的思念之情？这对你们的关系有什么影响？",
	"While traveling, you awoke one night to find the patron in your rucksack, devouring your rations and other supplies. The famished creature was initially hostile if you attempted to get your food back. How did you make them trust you? Did you offer more food? Perhaps some water? What about this interaction endeared you enough to become a warlock?": "在旅行中，有一天晚上你醒来时发现守护神在你的背包里，吞噬了你的口粮和其他用品。如果你试图拿回你的食物，这个饥肠辘辘的生物最初是有敌意的。你是如何让他们信任你的呢？你提供更多的食物吗？也许是一些水？这次互动中，有哪些地方让你对成为一名术士有足够的好感？",
	"Your patron sought out you in particular. Perhaps they arrived on your doorstep or at your campsite one morning and demanded you swear a pact with them. Why were you chosen? Do you even know? Work out the reason with your Dungeon Master and determine if your warlock is aware of it.": "你的赞助人特别找上了你。也许他们在某天早上来到你的家门口或你的营地，要求你与他们签订契约。为什么你会被选中？你知道吗？和你的地下城主一起找出原因，并确定你的术士是否意识到了这一点。",
	"You and your patron died at the exact same time. Both of your deaths were unplanned accidents and the deity of death apologized to you both personally. Unfortunately, they could not revive you both without intermingling your souls. Now you and the patron are forever connected. How do the both of you feel about this arrangement?": "你和你的赞助人正好在同一时间死亡。你们俩的死亡都是计划外的意外，死亡之神亲自向你们俩道歉。不幸的是，如果不把你们的灵魂混在一起，他们就无法使你们俩复活。现在你和守护神永远联系在一起了。你们两个人对这种安排有什么感觉？",
	"While sleeping one night, you had a strange dream. In the dream, the patron reached out to you, asking for your help. Did you try to ignore the dream or readily embrace it? Regardless, you sought out the patron through these mysterious portents and eventually found one another.": "一天晚上睡觉时，你做了一个奇怪的梦。在梦中，守护神向你伸出手来，请求你的帮助。你是试图忽略这个梦，还是欣然接受它？无论如何，你通过这些神秘的预兆寻找守护神，最终找到了彼此。",
	"In many ways, an animal companion created using this is a halfway between a standard Ranger animal companion, a familiar, and a player character.": "在许多方面，使用这种方法创建的动物伙伴是介于标准游侠动物伙伴、熟人和玩家角色之间的半成品。",
	"Creating an animal companion consists of four simple steps. The first step is to determine what type of creature you are building your companion to emulate. Next, the character raising the companion selects its origin. Origin determines what sort of creature it is and include almost all types presented in the Monster Manual. It's similar to selecting a Race for a player character. The third step is to choose the companion's archetype from the presented options. Archetypes are like a class' ability of the same name but determines the bulk of the companion's Ability Scores, its Armor Class, Hit Die, and any special abilities it might possess. Finally, the Dungeon Master determines the companion's Temperament.": "创建一个动物伴侣包括四个简单的步骤。第一步是确定你要建造的伴侣是模仿哪种类型的生物。接下来，养育伴侣的角色选择其起源。起源决定了它是什么类型的生物，包括《怪物手册》中介绍的几乎所有类型。这类似于为玩家角色选择种族。第三步是在所提供的选项中选择同伴的原型。原型就像类的同名能力，但它决定了同伴的大部分能力值、护甲等级、命中率以及它可能拥有的任何特殊能力。最后，地下城主决定了同伴的气质。",
	"The specifics of creating an animal companion are explained in depth later in this section. They gain levels the same way as a player character does but cannot multiclass, have a lower Proficiency Bonus, and are designed to be weaker than a true player character but not as weak as a normal animal companion.": "创建动物伙伴的具体细节将在本节后面深入解释。它们与玩家角色一样获得等级，但不能多类，有较低的熟练度奖励，并且被设计为比真正的玩家角色弱，但不像普通的动物伙伴那样弱。",
	"Mechanically, the companion obeys its master's commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but the Dungeon Master determines its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. Alternatively, if the companion trusts and respects its master, its actions in combat are controlled by the player character or the group  as a whole.": "在机制上，同伴尽可能地服从其主人的命令。它和其他生物一样，会进行主动性滚动，但地下城管理员决定它的行动、决定、态度等等。或者，如果同伴信任并尊重它的主人，那么它在战斗中的行动就由玩家角色或整个团体来控制。",
	"It's important to understand that the animal companion class is only taken by a baby creature when it reaches a point in its physical development where it is combat capable. It might not be at its fully maturity, but even a young dog is capable of defending itself before long.": "重要的是要明白，动物伴侣类只有在身体发育到一定程度，具备战斗能力的时候，才会被幼小的生物所接受。它可能还没有完全成熟，但即使是一只年轻的狗，在不久之后也有能力保护自己。",
	"While an animal companion is in its developmental stage, it favors flight over fight and sticks close to its master. It expects to be protected and nurtured while it grows and while it might still act within its temperament it is still beholden to standard survival instincts. These creatures know they are not powerful enough to face down even the common goblin or imp until they have grown into a juvenile stage.": "当一个动物伴侣处于发育阶段时，它更倾向于逃跑而不是战斗，并紧紧地跟随着主人。它期望在成长过程中得到保护和培养，虽然它可能仍在其气质范围内行事，但仍受制于标准的生存本能。这些生物知道，在它们成长为少年阶段之前，它们还没有强大到足以面对甚至是普通的地精或小恶魔。",
	"A youthful dragon unleashes an attempted bellow before peppering its tiny quarry with a weak electrical breath.": "一条年轻的龙在向它的小猎物发出微弱的电光呼吸之前，发出了一声尝试性的吼叫。",
	"The hiccups of a phase kitten cause it to uncontrollably blink between dimensions.": "阶段性小猫的打嗝会导致它不受控制地在维度之间眨眼。",
	"An owlbear chick chases down a rabbit while swiping wildly with its still unwieldy claws.": "一只猫头鹰小熊追赶一只兔子，同时用它那仍旧笨重的爪子疯狂地挥舞着。",
	"Animal companions come in all shapes and sizes. Unlike other classes, an animal companion is beholden only to its training and its species. An owlbear will almost always be easily identifiable as an owlbear, whereas a sorcerer might be confused for a warlock to the uninitiated. If left to their own devices, these creatures will follow their instincts to survive but, with the proper guidance, even the most dangerous creature can be trained and raised into something truly special.": "动物伴侣有各种形状和大小。与其他类别不同的是，动物伙伴只受制于它的训练和它的物种。一只猫头鹰熊几乎总是很容易被识别为猫头鹰熊，而一个巫师在不熟悉的情况下可能会被混淆为一个术士。如果任其自生自灭，这些生物将遵循其生存的本能，但在适当的指导下，即使是最危险的生物也能被训练和培养成真正特别的东西。",
	"When creating an animal companion, it is important to have a clear vision of the base creature in mind. Its base abilities should be reflective of the average member of its species with future abilities representing growth, training, and even magical augmentation.": "在创造一个动物伙伴时，重要的是在头脑中对基本生物有一个清晰的认识。它的基本能力应该反映其物种的一般成员，未来的能力代表成长、训练，甚至是魔法的增强。",
	"An animal companion will have more options at lower levels, but will be better at a great fewer things than a true player character. However, they are more flexible in their ability selections. This class seeks to cover the creation of potentially any creature that ever has or ever will be created.": "动物伙伴在低级别的时候会有更多的选择，但比真正的玩家角色更擅长的事情会少很多。然而，他们在能力选择上更加灵活。这个等级试图涵盖曾经或将要创造的任何生物的创造。",
	"Dungeon Masters, feel free to permit your players to change certain origin granted Wild Features to other, more appropriate ones that better capture the feel of a creature. Ethereal Jaunt is vital for capturing the feel of a Phase Spider but is a powerful ability. In such instances, consider replacing all or most of a companion's origin features. Perhaps you'd rather simply decrease the rank of such a feature for that one, specific creature so that they can obtain it at a lower level. All of these are perfectly valid solutions that help make this system more flexible. Remember, you always have the final say but should try to be accommodating and reasonable.": "地下城主，请允许你的玩家将某些起源赋予的野性特征改为其他更合适的特征，以更好地捕捉生物的感觉。虚无飘渺对于捕捉相位蜘蛛的感觉至关重要，但这是一个强大的能力。在这种情况下，可以考虑替换同伴的全部或大部分起源特征。也许你宁愿简单地降低那一个特定生物的这种特性的等级，以便它们能在较低的等级上获得它。所有这些都是完全有效的解决方案，有助于使这个系统更加灵活。记住，你总是有最终的决定权，但应该努力做到包容和合理。",
	"It's important to understand and develop a training regimen specific to an animal companion. Origin, Temperament, and Archetype are all good indicators for what it will respond positively or negatively to. Animal rearing is not as easily boiled down to a single skill such as Animal Handling. Instead, various skills can be used to help foster the growth of an animal companion.": "了解并制定一个针对动物伴侣的训练方案是很重要的。起源、气质和原型都是很好的指标，表明它将对什么作出积极或消极的反应。饲养动物并不容易归结为一种单一的技能，如动物处理。相反，可以使用各种技能来帮助促进动物伙伴的成长。",
	"A master typically makes one training check every week to determine the success of their current approach. It takes a total of five successful or failed training checks to change the disposition of an animal companion, for better or worse. A list of example skills that can be used to train an animal companion are presented below, but Dungeon Masters or encouraged to allow creative solutions and regimens that encompass other skills or proficiencies.": "主人通常每周进行一次训练检查，以确定他们当前方法的成功。总共需要五次成功或失败的训练检查才能改变一个动物伙伴的性格，无论好坏。下面列出了可用于训练动物伴侣的技能范例，但鼓励地下城主允许创造性的解决方案和包含其他技能或熟练程度的制度。",
	"Lifestyle, supplies, and other factors all contribute to the difficulty of raising an animal companion. The below modifiers are used to change the DC of training checks based on the animal companion's disposition.": "生活方式、物资和其他因素都会导致饲养动物伴侣的难度。下面的修饰语用于改变基于动物伙伴的性格的训练检查的DC。",

	"Raising another creature is no small task. Even the humble dog is a massive responsibility for its master. Whether it's simply the Dungeon Master's decision to use a mishap or the direct result of a failed training check, accidents and other mistakes are a part of rearing a creature.": "养育另一种生物不是一项小任务。即使是不起眼的狗，对它的主人来说也是一个巨大的责任。无论是简单的地下城主的决定，还是训练检查失败的直接结果，意外和其他错误都是养育生物的一部分。",
	"Mishaps do not need to occur directly after the failed roll. Instead, they should take place at inopportune times such as in the field, when the party is trying to sleep, or when the companion's master is otherwise occupied or in a rush.": "意外不需要直接发生在失败的卷轴之后。相反，它们应该发生在不恰当的时候，比如在野外，在当事人试图睡觉的时候，或者在同伴的主人有其他事情或匆忙的时候。",

The failure counts as two failures and the animal companion acts in a way the conveys their new belief of superiority until the master succeeds on a training check.": "动物伙伴失去了对主人的尊重，认为自己才是真正的首领。这次失败算作两次失败，动物伙伴的行为会传达他们新的优越感，直到主人的训练检查成功。",

	"What do you do when a player decides they want their character to own a pet? The simple solution is to have them play a Beastmaster ranger or an arcane spellcaster who can cast find familiar, but what if a character of a different class finds an animal they wish to keep as a pet? Perhaps they don't want the hassle of dipping into a class with a built-in pet, but still want some mechanical benefit to having an animal around. Maybe your player hasn't found such an animal, but they've expressed interest in their character having some sort of animal companion. These rules allow player characters of all classes to adopt pets of their very own, while ensuring that rangers' animal companions and spellcasters' familiars remain more potent options.": "当玩家决定让他们的角色拥有一只宠物时，你该怎么办？简单的解决办法是让他们扮演一个兽人游侠或一个可以施展寻找熟悉动物的奥术师，但如果一个不同等级的角色发现了一个他们想养的动物作为宠物怎么办？也许他们不希望陷入一个有内置宠物的等级的麻烦中，但仍然希望有一个动物在身边有一些机械性的好处。也许你的玩家还没有找到这样的动物，但他们已经表达了对他们的角色拥有某种动物伙伴的兴趣。这些规则允许所有等级的玩家角色收养他们自己的宠物，同时确保游侠的动物伙伴和法术师的宠物仍然是更有力的选择。",
	"Pets must be beasts of 1/4 challenge rating or lower and an intelligence of 3 or lower, with the exception of the {@creature warhorse}. A creature must be trained before it can be effective in combat. A wild creature must be domesticated before it is trained. Finding the right place and person to purchase an animal from can be difficult; while the average human or elven city will have horses, cats, and dogs for sale, finding a pre-trained {@creature giant lizard} or flying snake may be difficult in some campaign settings. That said, a town in a deep jungle or swamp may well have such creatures for sale, while an underground city may sell {@creature giant fire} beetles to dungeon delvers. Similarly, in some far northern climates, there might be domesticated {@creature elk} for sale, but this is rare.": "宠物必须是挑战等级为1/4或更低，智力为3或更低的野兽，但（%0%）除外。一个生物必须经过训练才能在战斗中发挥效力。野生生物必须在训练前被驯化。找到合适的地方和人购买动物可能会很困难；虽然一般的人类或精灵城市会有马、猫和狗出售，但在一些战役环境中，找到一条预先训练好的（%1%）或飞蛇可能很困难。也就是说，在丛林或沼泽深处的城镇很可能有这种生物出售，而地下城市可能会向地牢探险者出售（%2%）甲虫。同样，在一些遥远的北方气候中，可能会有驯养的（%3%）出售，但这是很罕见的。",
	"Each pet adds 1 sp/day per size category to lifestyle expenses. For example, a Tiny {@creature rat} only costs 1 sp/day, while a Large {@creature warhorse} requires 4 sp/day. An owner can hunt food for their animal, or the animal can be trained to hunt for itself, halving the cost. The remaining cost represents other types of care, such as medicine, shelter, and toys. When training a domesticated animal to perform actions on command, the base lifestyle cost doubles. Thus, if you were teaching your Tiny rat to take the Perform action (described below in the Non-Combat Actions section), it would cost and additional 1 sp/ day as long as you were teaching your rat. This cost represents things like extra treats and supplies. Domesticating a wild animal increases the cost to 1 gp/day per size category. A Medium wolf, for instance, costs a full 3 gp/day to domesticate. This cost reflects the increased price of keeping the animal safely contained, and the comparatively larger amounts and more exotic types of food a wild animal requires.": "每只宠物在生活方式的支出上，每一个尺寸类别都会增加1个sp/day。例如，一只小号（%0%）只需要1西班牙镑/天，而一只大号（%1%）需要4西班牙镑/天。主人可以为他们的动物猎取食物，也可以训练动物为自己猎取食物，将费用减半。剩余的费用代表其他类型的护理，如药品、住所和玩具。当训练一个被驯化的动物按照指令执行动作时，基本的生活方式成本会增加一倍。因此，如果你在教你的小老鼠做表演动作（在下面的非战斗动作部分有描述），只要你在教你的老鼠，它就会花费额外的1石/天。这笔费用是指额外的食物和用品等。驯化一只野生动物的费用会增加到每个体型类别的1戈比/天。例如，一只中狼的驯化费用为3戈比/天。这笔费用反映了保持动物安全的代价，以及野生动物需要的相对较多和较奇特的食物类型。",
	"A wild animal must be reared from infancy to become domesticated. Sometimes, wild animals can be found semi-domesticated by monsters, such as {@creature wolves|wolf|MM} with {@creature goblins}, or hyenas with {@creature gnolls}. These animals can be re-trained as adults to be loyal to a party member.": "野生动物必须从婴儿期开始饲养才能成为驯化的动物。有时，野生动物可以被怪物发现半驯化，比如（%0%）与（%1%），或者鬣狗与（%2%）。这些动物在成年后可以被重新训练，使其对党员忠诚。",
	"Domesticating a wild animal uses a variant of the optional loyalty rules for NPCs. An animal's loyalty score is on a scale from 0 to 20. An animal's maximum loyalty is equal to the Wisdom score of its owner. Wild animals start at loyalty 0. Animals trained by monsters start at loyalty 5.": "驯养野生动物使用的是NPC的可选忠诚度规则的变体。动物的忠诚度得分是在0到20的范围内。动物的最大忠诚度等于其主人的智慧值。野生动物从忠诚度0开始，由怪物训练的动物从忠诚度5开始。",
	"To domesticate an animal, a player must make one Animal Handling check. The Animal Handling check has a DC of 10 + the animal's HD. Success means that the animal's loyalty increases by one point. Failure means that loyalty does not increase; failure by more than five means that the animal's loyalty decreases by one point. Dealing damage to an animal, pushing an animal beyond its limits, frightening an animal, or failing to feed or care for an animal lowers an animal's loyalty by 1 point per day. ": "要驯化一只动物，玩家必须进行一次动物处理检查。驯养动物检查的DC为10+该动物的HD。成功意味着该动物的忠诚度增加一分。失败意味着忠诚度不增加；失败超过5次意味着动物的忠诚度减少1点。对动物造成伤害，把动物逼到极限之外，吓唬动物，或者没有喂养或照顾动物，都会使动物的忠诚度每天降低1点。",
	"An animal that reaches loyalty 10  is domesticated and loyal to its trainer. The animal will now follow its owner to the best of its ability. It will not obey commands more complex than \"follow,\" nor will it enter a dangerous situation of its own volition.

If the owner was the one who deliberately led the animal into the situation in question, the pet's loyalty score decreases by 1 point.": "忠诚度达到10的动物是被驯化的，对其训练者忠诚。该动物现在会尽其所能地跟随主人。它不会服从比 \"跟随 \"更复杂的命令，也不会主动进入危险的环境。如果动物被迫进入一个危险的环境，它就会畏缩，直到危险过去。如果主人是故意将动物带入危险境地的人，那么宠物的忠诚度会减少1分。",
	"A pet owner can continue to build loyalty with an animal after it has been domesticated; this allows the animal to be trained. A trained animal can take actions when commanded. Most commands must be verbal, though hand signals can be used if the animal has line of sight to its owner.": "宠物主人可以在动物被驯化后继续与它建立忠诚关系；这使动物可以被训练。受过训练的动物在接到命令时可以采取行动。大多数命令必须是口头的，但如果动物能看到主人，也可以使用手势。",
	"Every point of loyalty beyond 10 allows you to teach an animal one additional action that it is physically capable of performing. If an animal becomes owned by someone with a Wisdom score lower than 10 + the number of skills the animal knows, the animal does not forget any of its known actions.": "忠诚度每超过10分，你就可以多教给动物一个它在身体上能够完成的动作。如果一只动物被一个智慧分低于10+该动物知道的技能数量的人所拥有，该动物不会忘记它的任何已知动作。",
	"These are some examples of actions and tricks a pet can learn. A pet cannot be commanded to act in combat unless it has been trained in combat actions.": "这些是宠物可以学习的一些行动和技巧的例子。除非宠物接受过战斗行动的训练，否则不能命令它在战斗中行动。",

	"An emberborn is a small, canine-like creature created from ash and burning embers built around a core of molten metal. They are birthed from the pyres of creatures sacrificed to the Ashen Wolf, yet they are often friendly and pleasant to mortals. When provoked, they unleash a blast of ash and smoke before closing in with teeth like red-hot pokers. When at rest, they often sleep within fireplaces and other areas where fires are commonly stoked. They feast on raw meat whenever the opportunity presents itself, and enjoy being presented with gifts of metal and rare wood, as they enjoy devouring both in large quantities.": "微光兽是一种小型犬科动物，由灰烬和燃烧的余烬围绕熔化的金属核心创造而成。它们从被献给灰狼的生物的火堆中诞生，但它们通常对凡人很友好，很讨人喜欢。当受到挑衅时，它们会释放出灰烬和烟雾，然后用烧红的火钳般的牙齿逼近。休息时，它们经常睡在壁炉和其他经常生火的地方。只要有机会，他们就会大吃生肉，并喜欢被赠送金属和稀有木材的礼物，因为他们喜欢大量吞噬这两种东西。",

	"When summoning an emberborn deliberately, a brazier filled with wood and rare metal is presented and the blood of a sacrificed beast is poured over the open flame as the summoner performs the eldritch incantation. The fire will burn quickly, and when it is reduced to coals, the emberborn will begin to take shape. It will emerge from the fire and demand to be fed. If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master. If the summoner does not, then the emberborn will vanish into smoke and seek a forest to ignite instead.": "当故意召唤琥珀之神时，一个装满木头和稀有金属的钎子会被呈上，当召唤者执行长生咒时，牺牲的野兽的血会被浇在明火上。火焰会迅速燃烧，当它被烧成焦炭时，微光兽会开始成形。它将从火中出现并要求被喂食。如果召唤者毫不犹豫地将自己的一滴血提供给新出生的野兽，那么微光兽就会微笑着向新主人宣誓效忠。如果召唤者不这样做，那么微光兽就会消失在烟雾中，转而寻找森林来点燃。",

The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master's affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings.": "当它们为与狩猎者结盟的术士服务时，它们作为侦察员和预示者，为追捕猎物的猎犬服务，试图将它们赶入主人的魔掌。它们与狩猎者的其他野兽有很强的联系，尽管它们很傲慢，通常将自己视为最受欢迎的野兽。骏马可能携带，猎犬可能享受主人的感情，但鹰是第一个，鹰将是最后一个。它们的骄傲会让它们做出看似不可能的近乎自杀式的勇敢壮举，比如撕下巫师的眼睛，潜入龙的喉咙，用它们锋利的翅膀劈砍。",

	"The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang. If the summoner remains calm and still through this process, they will succeed in the rite, gifting the serpent with life and causing it to become corporeal. If they express emotion or pain, then an agonizing toxin will flood their veins and the ritual will be disrupted.": "帝国眼镜蛇是最致命的毒蛇之一，它们的血统被注入了蛇皇后的魔力，赋予了它们语言和狡猾。这些眼镜蛇从一个漫长的血统中孵化出来，被培育成间谍、刺客和朝臣的助手，它们是恶意的、狡猾的。它们的毒液很强，并注入了强大的魔法，甚至可以伤害那些受保护的人，使其免受这种毒素的伤害。在休息时，它们会寻找小动物，如老鼠或鸟类，并折磨它们作为娱乐，逐渐注入少量的毒液，直到生物在可怕的痛苦中死去。这些眼镜蛇喜欢拍马屁，也喜欢玩机智的游戏，并欣然接受爬行动物和鸟类赠送的珍贵宝石、珠宝、镜子、异国肉类和鸡蛋等。适当的咒语和话语在没有分叉的舌头的情况下很难念出来，因此，不是皇后的仆人很少做这种事。随着仪式的进行，召唤者必须在他们的手上刻下一个小的、獠牙状的标记，然后把它放在火炉的火上，献给眼镜蛇。这条野兽将从火中出现，最初是一条绿色火焰的大蛇，盘旋着，发出恶毒的嘶嘶声。火焰蛇会袭击献上的手，在铭刻的獠牙上烧出一条细线。如果召唤者在这个过程中保持冷静和静止，他们将成功完成仪式，赋予大蛇生命并使其成为有形之物。如果他们表现出情绪或痛苦，那么一种痛苦的毒素就会充斥他们的血管，仪式就会被打乱。",

These shards appear as small faceless statues that vaguely resemble the paramour, and are given as a reminder of the grim purpose that drives the servants of this fallen star. They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe. Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment. If they are truthful, then the shard will swear loyalty in a series of gestures and serve faithfully as a familiar from then on. If they are deceptive, then the shard will shed a tear of molten crystal, shatter into fragments, and rejoin the Exile in the skies above.": "发光的碎片是一个小型的人形建筑，由堕落的流亡者的眼泪结晶而成，当它目睹了它的凡人之爱被处决时，它流下了眼泪。这些碎片以小型无脸雕像的形式出现，依稀像极了那个姘头，并被用来提醒驱使这颗堕落之星的仆人的严峻目的。它们在黑夜中闪耀着璀璨的力量，并驱赶着那些隐藏着完成任务所需的失落神器和仪式的阴影。这些碎片一心一意地追求，不会因为危险而退缩。当他们的冲锋陷阵时，他们心甘情愿地牺牲自己，就像放逐者所愿意的那样，以自己的生命为代价寻求拯救倒下的战友。然而，他们仍然带着他们的始祖曾经持有的对凡人的蔑视的火花，每当他们目睹一个凡人的敌人倒下时，就会发出恶毒的光芒。与其他家族成员相比，召唤发光的碎片相当简单。人们只需站在火炉前，点燃它，并热烈地谈论他们渴望的东西或他们失去的东西。火舌会开始燃烧成温暖的蓝色和金色，同时一起移动成一个人形。然后召唤者必须轻轻地伸出一只手，帮助这个小实体离开火炉。当它离开时，它将凝固成一块发光的碎片。然后召唤者必须声明他们的生活目的，就像他们在那一刻看到的那样。如果他们是真实的，那么这块碎片将以一系列的手势宣誓忠诚，并从那时起作为一个熟悉的人忠实地服务。如果他们是欺骗性的，那么这个碎片将流下一滴熔化的水晶之泪，破碎成碎片，并在天空中重新加入流亡者的行列。",

	"The symphonic songbird is a colorful avian creature that mimics the voices of others, and can produce a beautiful melody fit for any occasion. They seem to originate from birds that have fallen for the allure of the Perfect Chord and have been touched by the magical emanations that constantly flow from it.

Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. Summoning a symphonic songbird involves singing, as one might expect. The brazier is lit, the incense is burned, and the summoner must begin a melody of their own creation. It must be carefully done, so that there is room for another to harmonize without interruption or disruption, and is often difficult for novices. Once the song reaches the correct moment, the fire within the brazier will coalesce into the image of a songbird, and it will begin to sing along with its new master. The summoner must continue their song to an appropriate closing, guiding the bird out from the brazier at the same time. Once it has emerged fully and is corporeal, the warlock must end the song and speak their name. The symphonic songbird will repeat the name perfectly, and then speak its own.

The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials.

In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach.": "财富模仿者喜欢被喂食其他货币。一些学者低声说这是为了给他们权力，但其他人怀疑他们只是天生吃人。阴谋中的人被认为在创造财富模仿者时有一个内置的安全措施，以防最终计划出错。在这种情况下，他们会在被剥夺了其他肉体后疯狂地吞噬彼此，使他们对那些他们无法接触到的人无害。",

Instead, the Dungeon Master is encouraged to roll a d20 and consult the following table to randomly determine the temperament of the animal companion. Alternatively, the Dungeon Master can also select a temperament for a creature that they feel would be interesting for both the player and group to interact with and for the Dungeon Master to roleplay.": "气质对于动物伴侣来说，就像背景对于游戏角色一样。它们是生物创造中一个较小的、更注重角色扮演的部分。然而，它们确实会改变能力分数和涉及该生物的训练检查的DC。地牢管理员不应允许玩家选择他们的生物的气质。相反，我们鼓励地下城管理员掷出一个D20，并参考下表来随机决定动物伙伴的气质。另外，地下城管理人也可以为他们认为对玩家和团体来说都很有趣的生物选择一种气质，并让地下城管理人进行角色扮演。",

As a Dungeon Master, do your best to include the ideas presented in this section at every stage of the animal companion's development.": "气质应该在动物伙伴的角色扮演中发挥很大作用，尤其是新生儿。即使在生物变得有战斗力之前，它也应该有一个基于其起源和气质的个性。任何物种的年轻生物通常都是好奇的麻烦制造者，他们寻求了解他们周围的世界。作为地下城管理员，请尽力在动物伙伴发展的每个阶段纳入本节中提出的想法。",

They only add their proficiency modifier. Certain Wild Features can increases the DC of an animal companion's effects.": "一些野性特征要求生物进行蓄力以抵抗其效果。你的动物伙伴的特性的DC与普通生物的DC处理方式不同。由于你的动物伙伴的能力分数的限制性更强，他们有一个稍高的基本修饰，并且不在DC上添加任何能力修饰。他们只增加他们的熟练度修饰值。某些野性特征可以增加动物伙伴的效果的DC。",

They lose one use of that spell, and you gain the ability to cast that spell once for the next 24 hours without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.": "在10级的时候，你的熟人可以偷取敌人施法者的魔法。当你的熟人用攻击击中一个敌人时，那个敌人必须做一个智力救赎，其DC等于你的巫师法术救赎DC。如果救赎失败，你会选择一个目标知道并且目前可以施展的法术。他们将失去一次使用该法术的机会，而你将获得在接下来的24小时内施放一次该法术的能力，而不需要消耗一个法术槽或需要材料成分。",
	"Once used, you cannot use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.": "一旦使用，你就不能再使用这个功能，直到你完成一个短期或长期的休息。",
	"At 14th level, as a reaction, you can redirect any damage you take to your familiar. This damage cannot exceed the familiar's maximum hit points + your Intelligence modifier": "在14级时，作为一种反应，你可以将你受到的任何伤害转给你的熟人。这个伤害不能超过熟悉的人的最大命中率+你的智力修正值。"
