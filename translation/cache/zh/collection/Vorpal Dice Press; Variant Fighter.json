The DC for these effects is {@b 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier}.": "你有能力引导神圣的能量并产生神奇的效果。你开始时有一个这样的效果。礼物。当你使用你的通道神性时，你可以选择产生哪种效果。然后你必须完成一个短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用你的神力通道。一些神性通道的效果需要蓄力。这些效果的DC是（%0%）。",

	"As an action, you present a symbol of your faith and speak a prayer calling for assistance from your charge.

	"If a creature you can see or hear within 60 feet casts a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to stall its effect and potentially end it. If that spell is 3rd level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action or less, that creature must make a contested Charisma check to resist your delaying effect. If you succeed, the creature is forced to concentrate on the spell until it's next turn, and the creature must cast the spell immediately at the start of it's next turn (no action required). If the target can't concentrate on this spell, or can't cast it at the start of its next turn, the spell is wasted.": "如果你在60英尺范围内看到或听到一个生物施展法术，你可以用你的反应来试图拖延它的效果并有可能结束它。如果该法术是第三级或更低，并且施法时间为1个动作或更短，该生物必须进行有争议的魅力检查以抵抗你的延迟效果。如果你成功了，该生物将被迫在下一回合前集中精力施法，并且该生物必须在下一回合开始时立即施法（不需要行动）。如果目标不能专注于这个法术，或者不能在下一回合开始时施放这个法术，那么这个法术就浪费了。",
