	"A noble race that roams the great plains of the world, centaurs are both feared and respected by other intelligent creatures. Centaur legends claim that they are the offspring of a powerful god of war that came down to the mortal plane in the form of a stallion. They are proud of this divine heritage and demand that the proper respect be shown to them.": "半人马是一个在世界大平原上游荡的高贵种族，它既被其他智慧生物所惧怕，又受到尊重。半人马的传说中，他们是一个强大的战神的后代，以骏马的形式降临到凡间。他们为这一神圣的遗产感到自豪，并要求对他们给予适当的尊重。",
	"I once saw a stampede of centaurs going to battle against the cyclopes, west of Xanderia. There is no more marvelous sight in Thylea than their spears gleaming in the sun of the steppes, wild manes flowing, hooves thundering. That night, they feasted and sang under the stars, calling out to me from afar, but I confess that I was too afraid to draw near.": "我曾看到半人马在Xanderia西部与独眼巨人作战。在Thylea，没有比他们的长矛在大草原的阳光下闪闪发光、野性的鬃毛飘扬、马蹄声如雷更令人惊叹的景象了。那天晚上，他们在星空下大吃大喝，从远处向我呼唤，但我承认，我不敢靠近。",
	"Centaurs possess a humanoid torso with a horse's lower body. They are as varied in coloration and physical build as humans and horses. Their horse body can be chestnut brown, black as a nightmare, pure white as a unicorn, grey, and other colors between. They can be a single color, spotted, have white \"socks,\" or have hooves of different coloration. Their human bodies can be of any skin color from dark skinned to pale. Their human hair can be black, brown, blonde, or red—but it most often complements that of their horse body.": "半人马拥有人形的躯干和马的下半身。他们的肤色和身体构造与人类和马匹一样多变。他们的马身可以是栗棕色，像噩梦一样的黑色，像独角兽一样的纯白色，灰色，以及介于两者之间的其他颜色。它们可以是单一颜色，有斑点，有白色 \"袜子\"，或有不同颜色的蹄子。它们的人类身体可以是任何皮肤颜色，从深色皮肤到苍白。它们的人类毛发可以是黑色、棕色、金黄色或红色，但最常见的是与它们的马身相得益彰。",
	"Centaurs are a proud people. They view themselves as superior to all other races and demand respect and adulation. They can be vain about their appearance and are careful to be dignified and aloof in the presence of others. However, most centaurs are also fond of drink and once inebriated they can become loud, boorish, and dangerous.": "半人马是一个骄傲的民族。他们认为自己优于所有其他种族，要求得到尊重和崇拜。他们对自己的外表很虚荣，在别人面前会小心翼翼地保持尊严和冷漠。然而，大多数半人马也喜欢喝酒，一旦喝醉了，他们就会变得吵闹、粗野和危险。",
	"Centaurs are a tribal people. Centaurs are fiercely loyal to members of their tribe and will never leave one of their own behind. When they mate, they mate for life. If they join an adventuring group, they will often consider that group to be their current tribe and will be intensely loyal to their fellow heroes.": "半人马是一个部落性的民族。半人马对自己的部落成员非常忠诚，绝不会抛弃自己的成员。当他们交配时，他们会终生交配。如果他们加入了一个冒险团体，他们往往会把这个团体看作是他们现在的部落，并且会对他们的同伴英雄们表示强烈的忠诚。",
	"They normally roam huge expanses of steppe land that they consider their domain. They don't build settlements in these lands, but they are protective of them. While centaurs can be herbivores, they prefer meat and enjoy hunting, but they will resort to gathering fruit, nuts, and other plants if an area has been overhunted. Travelers who are respectful of the plants and animals in tribal territory are left alone, but those who disrespect nature or try to build permanent settlements of any kind will become a target of the tribe's wrath.": "他们通常在巨大的草原土地上漫游，认为这是他们的领地。他们不在这些土地上建造定居点，但他们会保护这些土地。虽然半人马可以是食草动物，但他们更喜欢肉食，喜欢打猎，但如果一个地区被过度捕猎，他们会采取收集水果、坚果和其他植物的方式。尊重部落领土上的植物和动物的旅行者可以不受影响，但那些不尊重自然或试图建立任何形式的永久定居点的人将成为部落愤怒的目标。",
	"Centaurs are distrustful of the civilized races. In the First War that raged five centuries ago, thousands of centaurs were killed by the invading Dragonlords, and the centaurs have never forgotten or forgiven. The distrust is mutual, especially as centaur tribes are now flocking to the banner of Sydon and raiding outlying farms. Centaurs that enter a Thylean town or city will find that they are tolerated but kept under constant watch.": "半人马对文明种族是不信任的。在五个世纪前的第一次战争中，成千上万的半人马被入侵的龙王杀害，半人马从未忘记或原谅过。这种不信任是相互的，尤其是半人马部落现在正涌向西顿的旗帜，袭击外围的农场。进入蒂尔城镇的半人马会发现，他们被容忍，但被持续监视。",
	"The centaurs tend to worship the mother goddess, but they will sometimes offer prayers to one of the titans, Sydon or Lutheria. They never worship the Five.": "半人马倾向于崇拜母神，但他们有时也会向泰坦之一、西顿或卢瑟亚提供祈祷。他们从不崇拜五神。",
	"Centaurs have names that are specific to their race. These names can often be difficult for members of other races to pronounce, so they can adopt nicknames when traveling with a band of non-centaurs.": "半人马的名字是他们种族特有的。这些名字对其他种族的成员来说往往难以发音，所以他们在与非半人马的队伍一起旅行时可以采用昵称。",
	"{@b Male Names:} Agrius (Agri), Amycus (Amy), Asbolus (Az), Bienor, Chiron, Cyllarus (Cyl), Dictys, Eurytus (Tus), Elatus, Eurytion (Yuri), Hylaeus (Hyla), Nessus, Perimedes (Peri), Pholus, Rhoetus (Rote), and Thaumas (Tom).": "{@b Male Names:} Agrius (Agri), Amycus (Amy), Asbolus (Az), Bienor, Chiron, Cyllarus (Cyl), Dictys, Eurytus (Tus), Elatus, Eurytion (Yuri), Hylaeus (Hyla), Nessus, Perimedes (Peri), Pholus, Rhoetus (Rote) 和 Thaumas (Tom) 。",

	"Centaurs mature at the same rate as humans.": "半人马以与人类相同的速度成熟。",
	"Centaurs have a tendency toward good. As a tribal people, they don't lean toward the freedom of a chaotic alignment, but they don't obey laws that they feel are unjust or ineffective. They lean toward neutral.": "半人马有一种向善的倾向。作为一个部落民族，他们不倾向于混乱的自由，但他们不遵守他们认为不公正或无效的法律。他们倾向于中立。",
	"Centaurs range from 6'6\" to 7 feet in height and weigh between 700 and 900 pounds. Your size is Medium, but you tower over most other races.": "半人马的身高在6英尺6英寸到7英尺之间，体重在700磅到900磅之间。你的体型是中等的，但你比其他大多数种族都要高。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.": "你能说、读、写普通话和希尔文。",
	"If you move 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit them with a melee attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage from the first attack.": "如果你向一个目标直线移动30英尺，然后在同一回合用近战攻击击中他们，目标会从第一次攻击中获得额外的1d6伤害。",
	"As a bonus action on your turn, you may allow a single willing ally within 5 feet of you to hitch a brief ride on your back. They are carried on your back until the end of your turn, at which point they must disembark within 5 feet of you. While being carried, your rider is not considered to be mounted and they are not vulnerable to attacks of opportunity. Your rider must be a bipedal creature of your size or smaller.": "在你的回合中，作为一个额外的行动，你可以让你身边5英尺内的一个自愿的盟友在你的背上搭个便车。他们会被背在你的背上，直到你的回合结束，这时他们必须在你的5英尺内下船。在被携带时，你的骑手不被认为是在骑马，他们不容易受到机会攻击。你的骑手必须是与你体型相当或更小的双足生物。",
	"Climbing or maneuvering in tight spaces is considered difficult terrain for you.": "攀爬或在狭小的空间内操纵被认为是你的困难地形。",
	"Medusa are humanoids that have made a bargain with dark powers to achieve beauty, eternal youth, great wealth, or some other mortal desire. As a consequence, their hair has been replaced with snakes, and their eyes have the power to petrify the unwary. They are despised and shunned by all other mortal races, and they must be careful to hide their identity when traveling in the civilized places of the world.": "美杜莎是与黑暗势力达成交易的人类，以实现美丽、永恒的青春、巨大的财富或其他一些凡人的欲望。因此，他们的头发已经被蛇所取代，他们的眼睛有能力使不小心的人石化。他们被所有其他凡人种族所鄙视和回避，在世界的文明地方旅行时，他们必须小心翼翼地隐藏自己的身份。",
	"\"Truly, I have never considered myself to be cursed. I wished for gold, and gold I now have—in great quantities. Those who displease me are added to my lovely collection of statues. And I prefer the company of my snakes to that of lesser mortals.\"": "\"真的，我从未认为自己是被诅咒的。我希望得到金子，而我现在有了金子--大量的。那些让我不高兴的人被添加到我可爱的雕像收藏中。而且我更喜欢与我的蛇为伴，而不是与较小的凡人为伴。\"",
	"Thousands of years ago, a woman came to Thylea seeking her fortune. When the creatures of that land asked her from whence she came, she would only say, \"I am from the land of the Gorgons.\" In those days, Thylea was rich in natural beauty but poor in wealth. But the woman would not be deterred.": "几千年前，一个女人来到蒂雷亚，寻求她的财富。当那片土地上的生物问她从哪里来时，她只说：\"我来自戈尔贡人的土地。\" 在那些日子里，蒂雷亚拥有丰富的自然美景，但却没有财富。但这个女人并没有被吓倒。",
	"Dwarves have strong, prominent features. Field dwarves have skin tanned and weathered by many years of sun and soil in the fields. Volcano dwarves have a slightly lighter complexion due to their lives spend toiling under the mountains. While field dwarves tend to dress simply, volcano dwarves take deep pride in their appearance. Their hair and beards, black or reddish brown, is worn in matted locks. They cap these coils in heavy beads of gold, bronze, or mountain glass. They trade with humans for royal colors of cloth and adorn themselves with thick rings and armbands, set with wide stones.": "矮人有强壮、突出的特征。田野矮人的皮肤被晒得黝黑，并在田间多年的阳光和土壤中风化。火山矮人的肤色略浅，因为他们的生活是在山下劳作。田野上的矮人往往穿着简单，而火山矮人则对自己的外表深感自豪。他们的头发和胡须是黑色或红棕色的，被打成一绺一绺的。他们用金、铜或山地玻璃制成的沉重的珠子为这些线圈戴上帽子。他们与人类交换皇家颜色的布匹，用厚厚的戒指和臂章装饰自己，上面镶嵌着宽大的宝石。",
	"First, the woman searched the steppes and mountains, and she came to the centaurs, asking, \"Where may I find gems and jewels to rival the stars?\" The centaurs offered her a shank of lamb and said, \"Why seek gems and jewels when the stars are free to everyone?\" Disappointed, she cast away the food and left the centaurs to their star-gazing.": "首先，这个女人搜索了大草原和山脉，她来到半人马的面前，问道：\"我在哪里可以找到可以与星星媲美的宝石和珠宝？\" 半人马给了她一块羊腿，并说：\"既然星星对每个人都是免费的，为什么还要寻找宝石和珠宝？\" 她很失望，扔掉了食物，让半人马去看星星。",
	"Then the woman searched the forests, and she came to the satyrs, asking, \"Where may I find rivers of gold and silver that flow like fountains?\" The satyrs offered her a goblet of wine and said, \"Gold and silver make a very poor feast. Wouldn't you rather join us for a song and a drink?\" Disappointed again, the woman cast away the goblet and left the satyrs to their revelry.": "然后这个女人搜索了森林，她来到萨提尔面前，问道：\"我在哪里可以找到像喷泉一样流动的金银河？\" 萨提尔给了她一杯酒，说：\"金子和银子是很差的宴席。你不愿意和我们一起唱歌和喝酒吗？\" 女人再次感到失望，她扔掉了酒杯，让萨提尔们继续狂欢。",
	"Now, the woman wandered high and low, seeking her fortune to no avail, and finally she came upon three women weaving at a loom. She said, \"I wish for riches beyond the imagination of all the creatures that haunt this accursed land.\" The three women, who were the Fates, warned her. \"Is this truly what you desire? You may have it, but the price will be high.\" And the woman answered, \"When I am rich, I shall have no trouble paying any price.\" And the Fates said, \"So be it.\"": "现在，这个女人在高处和低处徘徊，寻找她的财富，但没有结果，最后她来到三个女人的织布机前。她说：\"我希望得到的财富是所有在这块被诅咒的土地上出没的生物所无法想象的。\" 这三个女人是命运之神，她们警告她。\"这真是你的愿望吗？你可以拥有它，但代价会很高。\" 那女人回答说：\"当我富有时，我将不难支付任何价格。\" 命运之神说：\"那就这样吧。\"",
	"The woman's eyes suddenly gleamed like golden coins, and wherever she turned her gaze, creatures were turned to stone. \"So that none may rob you of your treasure,\" said the Fates. The woman's hair grew long and sinuous, slithering and scaled like snakes. \"So that always you will have the company of hearts as cold as your own.\" And finally, the woman's hands were filled with gems and coins that were beautiful beyond the reckoning of stars or songs. Her name was Medusa, and she was the namesake of her curse, which afflicts many such mortals with more ambition than sense.": "这个女人的眼睛突然像金币一样闪闪发光，她的目光所到之处，生物都变成了石头。\"命运之神说：\"这样就没有人可以抢夺你的财宝了。女人的头发长而蜿蜒，像蛇一样滑溜溜地长着鳞片。\"这样，你将永远有和你自己一样冷漠的心陪伴着你。\" 最后，这个女人的手上挂满了宝石和硬币，其美丽程度超出了星星和歌曲的计算范围。她的名字叫美杜莎，她是她的诅咒的名字，它折磨着许多这样的凡人，野心大于理智。",
	"Medusae have typically made bargains with some sort of fiend or fiendish power, but in some cases, they are oathbreakers who have displeased the gods or the Fates. Either way, they have been afflicted with the curse of the medusa as punishment, and recovery from the curse is not possible without the use of powerful magic. In some cases, even the {@spell greater restoration} spell may not be enough to break the curse. But in many other cases, the medusa simply embraces the curse as part of her identity. Children born to medusae are also affected by the curse.": "Medusae通常与某种恶魔或恶魔般的力量进行交易，但在某些情况下，他们是使诸神或命运之神不悦的违背誓言者。无论是哪种情况，他们都受到了美杜莎的诅咒作为惩罚，如果不使用强大的魔法，就不可能从诅咒中恢复。在某些情况下，即使是（%0%）的咒语也可能不足以打破诅咒。但在其他许多情况下，梅杜莎只是将诅咒作为她身份的一部分来接受。medusae所生的孩子也会受到诅咒的影响。",
	"Medusae are known to spend much of their time plotting against those who rival them in wealth, power, or beauty. Some medusae name their snakes and speak to them as if they were speaking to cherished pets or loved ones. Others are ashamed of their curse and seek to break it. Medusae must train themselves to never gaze into a mirror or stare at their reflection, for in an ironic twist of fate, they are vulnerable to their own petrifying gaze.": "众所周知，Medusae把大部分时间花在谋划反对那些在财富、权力或美貌上与他们匹敌的人。一些Medusae为他们的蛇命名，并对它们说话，就像对珍爱的宠物或亲人说话一样。其他人则对他们的诅咒感到羞耻，并试图打破它。Medusae必须训练自己永远不要注视镜子或盯着自己的倒影，因为在一个具有讽刺意味的命运转折中，他们很容易受到自己的石化目光的影响。",
	"Medusae are not born—they are made. When a humanoid is afflicted by the curse of the medusa, they gradually transform into a snake-haired monstrosity. Once transformed, they may live for a thousand years, but most are hunted down and killed long before then.": "Medusae不是天生的，它们是后天造就的。当一个人形生物受到美杜莎诅咒的折磨时，他们会逐渐变成一个蛇发的怪物。一旦变身，他们可能会活上一千年，但大多数人在那之前早就被猎杀了。",
	"Civilized medusae tend toward neutral or lawful evil alignments, because they must find ways to survive on the fringes of society. They must be careful to cooperate with others who will suffer the company of one who is cursed by the gods. Medusae who give into their anger eventually lose control of themselves and become true monsters.": "文明的梅杜莎人倾向于中立或合法的邪恶取向，因为他们必须在社会的边缘找到生存的方法。他们必须小心翼翼地与其他人合作，这些人将遭受被神明诅咒的人的陪伴。屈服于愤怒的梅杜莎人最终会失去对自己的控制，成为真正的怪物。",

	"Your eyes are adapted to dark places, giving you darkvision out to 60 ft.": "你的眼睛能适应黑暗的地方，使你的暗视能力达到60英尺。",
	"You are afflicted by the curse of the medusa, but your transformation is already complete. Your curse can only be ended with the {@spell wish} spell. If your curse ends, then your race changes to whichever race you were before you became cursed (usually a human).": "你被美杜莎的诅咒所困扰，但你的转变已经完成。你的诅咒只能通过{@spell wish}的咒语来结束。如果你的诅咒结束，那么你的种族就会变成你被诅咒前的那个种族（通常是人类）。",
	"You can attack with your snake hair. This is a melee weapon attack with an attack bonus equal to your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier.

	"Minotaurs are the descendants of an ancient tribe of humans who were cursed by the gods, transforming them into half-human, half-bull monstrosities.

	"Over a thousand years ago, a tribe of humans washed ashore in Thylea and came to live in the southern hills of the Aresian peninsula. Here, they laid foundations for a city and called it Minos. But not one man or woman among them had the strength to till the hard, rocky soil. As fate would have it, they discovered a magnificent bull that could pull a plow through any terrain for days without resting. Using the bull's great strength, they were able to produce bountiful crops with which to survive the first winter.": "一千多年前，一个人类部落被冲到蒂雷亚上岸，来到阿雷西亚半岛南部的山丘上生活。在这里，他们为一座城市打下了地基，并将其称为米诺斯。但他们中没有一个男人或女人有力量耕种坚硬的岩石土壤。在命运的安排下，他们发现了一头雄壮的公牛，它可以拉着犁在任何地形上连续几天不休息。利用公牛的巨大力量，他们能够生产出丰盛的作物，以度过第一个冬天。",
	"Over time, the people of the tribe began to venerate the bull, crowning him as the god of the harvest. When Sydon learned of this, he was furious. He threw curses down upon the settlers and transformed them into bulls, in mockery of their insolence. Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again—but their faces had been forever changed by the curse.": "随着时间的推移，部落里的人们开始崇敬这头公牛，把他封为丰收之神。当西顿得知此事后，大为恼火。他向定居者扔下诅咒，并把他们变成了公牛，以嘲笑他们的无礼。他们每个人都被绑在犁上，被迫踏上同样的蜿蜒的几何路径，直到这条路径成为一个深邃的迷宫式的峡谷。最终，犁破了，米诺斯的人民又慢慢开始直立起来--但他们的脸已经被诅咒永远改变了。",
	"The people of the tribe came to be called minotaurs—the bulls of Minos—and they have never fully shed their bull-like demeanors. Some of them merely have horns and a snout-like nose, while others have the entire upper torso of a bull.

Over the centuries, they have come to view their own cursed existence as the will of the Fates.": "该部落的人后来被称为米诺陶尔人--米诺斯的公牛--他们从未完全摆脱过公牛的神态。他们中的一些人仅仅有角和一个像鼻子一样的鼻子，而另一些人则拥有公牛的整个上半身躯干。一些人继续居住在迷宫里，而另一些人则离开了，去探索蒂雷亚的远方。几个世纪以来，他们已经把自己被诅咒的存在视为命运的意志。",
	"Minotaurs possess uncommon strength, making them excellent warriors. The curse infuses their bodies with the power of a bull at all times, and their muscles seldom relax, even when they are drunk or asleep. In battle, minotaurs sometimes lose control of their emotions and fly into a rage. When this happens, the curse takes over, transforming them back into a full-fledged bull for a short period of time.": "牛头人拥有不寻常的力量，使他们成为优秀的战士。诅咒使他们的身体随时都充满了公牛的力量，他们的肌肉很少放松，即使是在喝醉或睡着的时候。在战斗中，牛头人有时会失去对自己情绪的控制，陷入愤怒。当这种情况发生时，诅咒就会接管，在短时间内将他们重新变成一头成熟的公牛。",
	"Minotaurs are widely shunned, because they are believed to be unthinking brutes who have been cursed by the gods. Most minotaurs gather together to form small farming or fishing communities, far from civilization.

None can say which river or which mountains, for this was so long ago that the land has rolled and shifted so as to become unrecognizable in the time since. The mountains were blanketed in a soft powder of white snow, and as the snow melted, it crept along the ground and joined together into streams of water, which trickled along the rocks and formed a river. And the river coursed down through a forest, emptying into the ocean. So it went for eons.": "曾经有一条河流穿过山脉。没有人能说清是哪条河或哪座山，因为那是很久以前的事了，土地在此后的时间里不断滚动和移动，以至于变得难以辨认。山上覆盖着柔软的白雪粉末，当雪融化时，它沿着地面爬行，汇成水流，沿着岩石淌下，形成一条河流。这条河穿过森林，流入大海。就这样持续了好几个世纪。",
	"But then one day, the snow on the mountains had a thought. \"Am I alike to the water in the streams?\" And so also did the water in the river begin to wonder, \"Am I alike to the roots of the trees?\" They were curious, but it seemed that they would never know the answer, for just as the snow went to inspect the streams, it became the water, and just as the water went to inspect the trees, it became the roots. And so it went for eons.": "但有一天，山上的雪有了一个想法。\"我和小河里的水一样吗？\" 河里的水也开始想，\"我和树的根一样吗？\" 他们很好奇，但似乎他们永远不会知道答案，因为就像雪去检查溪流一样，它变成了水，就像水去检查树木一样，它变成了根。就这样持续了好几个世纪。",
	"Eventually, the Great Mother herself became aware of these questions. Holding the world in her embrace, she felt the curiosity of the elements rippling and vibrating across its surface, anxious for answers. And so, she loosened her grip—just slightly. The rippling thoughts of the snow and the waters and the rocks and the trees took shape, and their shapes were beautiful, for they were curiosity made manifest. These were the first nymphs.": "最终，伟大的母亲自己意识到了这些问题。她把世界抱在怀里，感觉到元素的好奇心在其表面荡漾和振动，急于寻找答案。于是，她松开了她的手--只是稍稍松开。雪、水、岩石和树木的涟漪思想形成了，它们的形状很美，因为它们是好奇心的体现。这些是第一批仙女。",
	"Nymphs are famed for their feminine charms, but they are not exclusively female. Some are awakened from the elements with a mix of masculine and feminine features, and others are quintessential specimens of male splendor. As fey creatures, nymphs like little less than to be nailed down by the crude shackles of mortal language. They come in as many shapes and forms as the earth itself. The only physical trait that all of them have in common is an awe-inspiring beauty.": "仙女以其女性的魅力而闻名，但她们并不完全是女性。有些人从元素中被唤醒，具有男性和女性的混合特征，有些人则是男性辉煌的典型标本。作为精灵生物，仙女不喜欢被凡人语言的粗俗桎梏所束缚。他们的形状和形式与地球本身一样多。她们唯一共同的身体特征是具有令人敬畏的美貌。",
	"Nymphs have an insatiable desire to learn as much as possible about both the natural and the civilized world. Because most have had eons to discover the splendor of nature, it is the civilized world that interests them the most. However, they are not usually very accustomed to mortal culture, and so they may think of men and women as interesting baubles to be collected and admired. Even civilized nymphs tend to cherish their friends and acquaintances as ‘pets' to be manicured and proudly exhibited. They are not above bragging about their collection—or fighting with one another over their favorites.": "仙女们有一种永不满足的欲望，要尽可能多地了解自然和文明世界。因为大多数人有好几个世纪的时间来发现自然的辉煌，所以他们最感兴趣的是文明世界。然而，他们通常不大习惯于凡人的文化，因此他们可能认为男人和女人是有趣的玩具，可以收集和欣赏。即使是文明的仙女，也倾向于把他们的朋友和熟人当作 \"宠物 \"来珍视，加以修剪并自豪地展示。她们不惜吹嘘自己的收藏，或为自己的最爱而相互争吵。",
	"Nymphs have names that sound beautiful and elemental.": "仙女们的名字听起来很美，也很有元素。",

	"Nymphs are born cocooned within some feature of their associated element. For example, dryads are usually born within trees, and nereids may be born within giant clamshells. Young nymphs sleep in their cocoon for up to one hundred years before emerging, fully mature. They can live for as long as one thousand years, although many choose to return to the elements once their curiosity about the world has been satisfied.": "仙女们出生时被包裹在其相关元素的某些特征中。例如，Dryads通常出生在树上，而Nereids可能出生在巨大的蚌壳里。年轻的仙女在茧里睡上一百年才会出现，完全成熟。他们可以活到一千年之久，尽管许多人在对世界的好奇心得到满足后会选择回到元素中。",
	"Nymphs tend toward chaotic alignments. They understand the concepts of good and evil, but they tend to select one or the other based on impulse rather than any deep-seated conviction. Nymphs tend to make a game out of performing acts that characterize their chosen alignment, rather than pausing for serious introspection.": "仙女们倾向于混乱的结盟。他们理解善与恶的概念，但他们倾向于根据冲动而不是任何根深蒂固的信念来选择其中一个或另一个。仙女们倾向于把表现他们所选择的结盟的行为作为一种游戏，而不是停下来进行认真的反省。",

	"Satyrs are a race of fey creatures with a strong link to the Feywild and all of the creatures and races that come from that place. They prefer forested wilderness but are not afraid to enter towns and cities to enjoy the company and other benefits of civilization.": "萨提尔是一个与仙界以及来自仙界的所有生物和种族有着密切联系的精灵生物种族。他们喜欢森林中的荒野，但并不害怕进入城镇，享受文明的陪伴和其他好处。",
	"Trust these horn-headed fiends to get the better end of any deal you make with them. They'll ask to be paid in wine, and then drink you into poverty. I caught one of them tupping my sister behind the stables, and rather than having the good sense to be ashamed, he wrote a song about it. Sod them all, but the damned goats play music that could make the Muse herself weep.": "相信这些角头魔鬼会在你与他们的任何交易中得到更好的结果。他们会要求用酒来支付，然后把你喝得一贫如洗。我抓到他们中的一个人在马厩后面拖拽我的妹妹，他非但没有感到羞愧，还为此写了一首歌。他们都是该死的，但这些该死的山羊演奏的音乐可以让缪斯本人流泪。",
	"Satyrs have the lower body of a goat and the upper body of an elf. A pair of goat-like horns sprout from their foreheads. These horns can range from small spikes to huge horns worthy of a mountain goat. In addition to a full head of hair, satyrs grow fur on their arms, legs, and torsos. Some satyrs grow less fur, and many choose to carefully shave the hair from their arms and body. They can have brown, black, blonde, red, grey, or white hair. Their skin color ranges from dark to pale.": "萨提尔的下半身是山羊的，上半身是精灵的。他们的额头上长出一对山羊般的犄角。这些角的范围可以从小的尖刺到巨大的角，配得上山羊的角。除了满头的头发外，萨提尔人的手臂、腿和躯干上还长有毛皮。有些萨提亚人的毛发长得较少，许多人选择仔细剃掉手臂和身上的毛发。他们可以有棕色、黑色、金黄色、红色、灰色或白色的头发。他们的皮肤颜色从深色到浅色不等。",

	"Satyrs don't have the same strained relationship with the civilized races of Thylea that the centaurs do. Satyrs can be found in many towns and villages throughout Thylea, as well as the great city of Mytros. They are attracted to the abundance of experiences that civilization provides: the food, the wine, and most especially the music.": "萨提尔人与蒂雷亚的文明种族之间的关系不像半人马那样紧张。在整个蒂雷亚的许多城镇和村庄，以及伟大的城市迈特罗斯，都可以找到萨提尔人。他们被文明提供的丰富经验所吸引：食物、酒，尤其是音乐。",

	"There is no denying the beauty of the songs of the sirens. They can be heard miles from shore, joining with the din of the ocean waves to create haunting melodies. Sailors are always blaming them for shipwrecks, of course, but I imagine that's a convenient excuse when you crash your own ship on the shoals.": "不可否认，海妖的歌声是美丽的。它们可以在离海岸几英里远的地方听到，与海浪的喧嚣一起，创造出令人神往的旋律。当然，水手们总是把沉船事故归咎于它们，但我想，当你把自己的船撞到浅滩上时，这也是一个方便的借口。",
	"Sirens are a race of winged, aquatic humanoids that typically dwell near rocky sea cliffs. They are famed for their beautiful voices, which they use to sing haunting lamentations, captivating listeners and transporting them to a bygone age. Sirens are rarely found very far inland. They prefer to remain near the coasts, as the gentle roar of the ocean waves calms their roiling emotions.": "海妖是一个有翅膀的水生人类种族，通常居住在多岩石的海崖附近。他们以美丽的声音而闻名，他们用这种声音唱出令人神伤的哀歌，吸引听众并将他们带入一个过去的时代。海妖很少在内陆地区被发现。他们更喜欢呆在海岸附近，因为海浪的轻柔轰鸣声可以平息他们汹涌的情绪。",
	"Sirens typically experience fluctuating moods from one day to the next, ranging from extreme joy and hope for the future, to extreme sorrow and pessimism. No matter how a siren feels, she expresses her emotion through song. On good days, she may annoy her companions with chirpy melodies and vocal warm-ups as she glides around on outstretched wings. Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet.": "海妖通常在一天中经历波动的情绪，从极端的喜悦和对未来的希望，到极端的悲伤和悲观。无论海妖的感觉如何，她都会通过歌曲来表达自己的情绪。在好的日子里，她可能会在伸出的翅膀上滑行时，用叽叽喳喳的旋律和声乐暖场来烦扰她的同伴。另一方面，在糟糕的日子里，她可能会看到她的呻吟和哀号，并拖着她的脚。",
	"The sirens once lived on a great expanse of shoals in the Cerulean Gulf, where they built a city of brilliant white limestone. Its towering spires and pillars thrust out from the rocky waters, allowing the sirens to fly or swim as they pleased. They lived here in joy, singing praises to Sydon, who governed the oceans. Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. \"Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine.\"": "海妖曾经生活在塞鲁利亚海湾的一片广阔的滩涂上，他们在那里用明亮的白色石灰岩建造了一座城市。它高耸的尖顶和柱子从岩石的水中伸出来，让海妖们可以随心所欲地飞行或游泳。他们在这里快乐地生活着，向管理海洋的西顿歌颂。西顿从他在普拉西斯的宝座上听到这些，不禁皱起眉头。\"如果他们真的感激，他们就不会建造他们的塔来与我的相媲美。",
	"When the sirens learned that Sydon was displeased, they were heartbroken. They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies—songs of repentance—which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. \"Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs.\"": "当海妖们得知西顿不高兴时，她们伤心欲绝。她们拆除了自己的塔楼，谱写了新的旋律--忏悔之歌--这些旋律再次随风传到泰坦的耳朵里。他无动于衷。\"如果他们真的忏悔，他们就不会如此厚颜无耻地唱歌，而是温顺地去献上适当的祭品来代替歌曲。\"",
	"This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten.": "这一次，海妖们被彻底打击了。他们曾相信他们的歌声受到了诸神的珍视。她们的声音静止了，在随后的寂静中，城市的光辉逐渐消失在阴影中。石头地基开裂，壁炉变得沉重。柱子倒塌了，海妖之城沉入大海深处，被汹涌的海水吞没。甚至它的名字也被遗忘了。",
	"Centuries passed in silence. Eventually, a new song began—an endless lamentation for the city that now sleeps on the ocean floor. When Lutheria learned that the city of the sirens had been destroyed, she laughed. She captured an entire flock of the pitiful creatures and gleefully cursed them, twisting them into something monstrous. These were the first harpies.": "几个世纪在沉默中过去了。最终，一首新的歌曲开始了--对现在沉睡在海底的城市的无尽哀叹。当卢瑟亚得知海妖之城被摧毁时，她大笑起来。她捕捉了一整群可怜的生物，并高兴地诅咒它们，把它们扭曲成一些可怕的东西。这就是第一批哈比人。",
	"Sirens are not amphibious, but they are well-adapted for living in and around water. They are thought to descend from an ancient Nereid who fell in love with an avian celestial. Iridescent scales cover many parts of their body, and their taloned hands and feet are excellent for fishing. They live in small flocks along the shores of the ocean. Siren artwork, poetry, and architecture emphasize their special relationship with both the clouds above and the sea below.": "海妖不是两栖动物，但它们很适合在水中和周围生活。他们被认为是古代尼瑞德的后代，尼瑞德爱上了一个禽类天体。五彩的鳞片覆盖了它们身体的许多部分，它们有爪子的手和脚是捕鱼的最佳选择。他们在海洋的海岸边小群生活。海妖的艺术作品、诗歌和建筑都强调了它们与上面的云和下面的海的特殊关系。",
	"Every siren is born with an abiding sense of sorrow that never fades—a soul-crushing grief caused by the loss of her ancestral home. From an early age, sirens learn to sing the ancient songs of their lost city, which evoke heart-wrenching memories of a time that will never come again. Anyone who hears a siren's song is immediately mesmerized by the overwhelming emotion conveyed by her beautiful voice. Some are moved to tears—others collapse into catatonia. The siren herself is not exempt from this—the moment she hears her own lamentations, she experiences an intense pang of loss.": "每个海妖出生时都有一种持久的悲伤感，这种悲伤感永远不会消退--由于失去祖先的家园而造成的灵魂上的悲伤。从很小的时候起，海妖就学会了唱他们失去的城市的古老歌曲，这些歌曲唤起了人们对那个永远不会再出现的时代的痛心回忆。任何听到海妖之歌的人都会立即被她美丽的声音所传达的压倒性的情感所迷住。有些人被感动得流泪，有些人则陷入紧张症。海妖自己也不能免俗--当她听到自己的悲鸣时，她会经历一种强烈的失落感。",
	"Sirens have broad, feathered wings growing out of their backs, which allow them to fly like birds. For this reason, sirens are often employed as messengers, tasked with conveying satchels of written letters from one city to another. However, a siren can only fly when her heart is filled with light. On such days, her songs are bright and joyful, no matter what manner of message she carries. Thus the saying, \"A siren in good spirits may yet carry ill news.\"": "海妖背上长着宽大的羽翼，可以像鸟一样飞行。由于这个原因，海妖经常被雇用为信使，负责将一袋袋书面信件从一个城市送到另一个城市。然而，海妖只有在她的内心充满光明时才能飞行。在这样的日子里，她的歌声是明亮而欢快的，无论她携带的是什么方式的信息。因此，有句话说：\"精神好的海妖可能还带着坏消息\"。",
	"Sirens have names that sound lyrical and sad. They are ancient names, carried down from generation to generation, and each is associated with an ancestral song. Sirens choose their own names when they come of age, selecting one from the song that moves them most deeply.": "海妖的名字听起来抒情而悲伤。它们是古老的名字，代代相传，每一个都与祖先的歌曲有关。海妖在成年后选择自己的名字，从最能打动她们的歌曲中选择一个。",

Some wish to prevent another such tragedy from befalling other races, which draws them toward good alignments. Others become bitter and pessimistic, tending toward neutral alignments.": "从出生开始，海妖就对失去祖先的家园感到深深的悲哀。一些人希望防止其他种族再次发生这样的悲剧，这使他们倾向于良好的取向。其他人则变得痛苦和悲观，趋向于中立的方向。",

Your mood may change before the next time you rest, but it won't affect which ability you have access to until after your next rest is completed.": "你的心情会影响你唱歌和飞行的能力。在任何短暂或长时间的休息后，你必须选择你的心情是快乐还是悲伤。当你感到悲伤时，你会失去你的飞行速度，但会获得悲伤的歌曲。当你感到快乐时，你会获得你的飞行速度，但会失去悲伤的歌曲。在你下次休息之前，你的心情可能会发生变化，但在你下次休息结束之前，它不会影响你可以使用的能力。",

She takes the form of a gargantuan tree on an island at the heart of the Cerulean Gulf, and her followers believe that her roots reach deep into the earth, binding the world together in an eternal embrace.
