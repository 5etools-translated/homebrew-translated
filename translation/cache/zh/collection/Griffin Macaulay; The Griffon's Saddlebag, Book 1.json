	"This golden badge is usually given to wizards who either excel at or who have mastered abjuration magic as a symbol of their accomplishments. While wearing this badge, you always have the {@spell shield} spell prepared if you know it, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared. In addition, whenever you cast the {@i shield} spell, you can take another reaction before the start of your next turn. This second reaction can't be used to cast the {@i shield} spell again.": "这个金色的徽章通常是给那些擅长或已经掌握了堕落魔法的巫师，作为他们成就的象征。在佩戴这个徽章的时候，如果你知道这个{@spell shield}的法术，你总是有准备，而且它不计入你可以准备的法术数量。此外，每当你施放（1%）法术时，你可以在下一回合开始前做出另一个反应。这第二个反应不能被用来再次施放（%2%）法术。",
	"This shield emits a faint, holy glow when wielded and recognizes your devotion to a higher power. When you attune to this shield, the emblem adorning its face changes to one that represents your chosen deity, allowing you to use the shield as a holy symbol. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.": "这面盾牌在挥舞时发出微弱的圣洁光芒，承认你对更高力量的奉献。当你对这面盾牌进行调适时，其表面装饰的徽记会变成代表你所选择的神灵的徽记，使你可以将这面盾牌作为一个神圣的象征。在挥舞此盾牌时，除了盾牌的正常攻击力加成外，你还能获得+1的攻击力加成。",
	"While wielding the shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to shatter into countless fragments of pure light. The pieces of light protect you as if you were wielding the shield, leaving your hands free. The light surrounds you for 1 minute, until you dismiss the effect as a bonus action, or until you fall unconscious or die, at which point the shield rematerializes on the ground at your feet or into your hand if you have one free. If your holy symbol is emblazoned or attached to the shield, it floats prominently amidst the shards of light and continues to function as a spellcasting focus. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you while you're surrounded by the light in this way. The surrounding shards of light cast bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.": "在挥舞盾牌的时候，你可以把它的命令语作为一个额外的动作，使它破碎成无数的纯光的碎片。这些光的碎片会保护你，就像你挥舞着盾牌一样，让你的双手自由。光线围绕着你，持续1分钟，直到你以额外行动解除该效果，或者直到你昏迷或死亡，这时盾牌会在你脚下的地面上重新显现，或者如果你有一个空闲的手，则会变成你的手。如果你的神圣符号被刻在盾牌上或附着在盾牌上，它就会突出地漂浮在光的碎片中，并继续作为施法的焦点发挥作用。当你以这种方式被光包围时，不死生物在对你的攻击卷中处于劣势。周围的光之碎片在20英尺范围内投射亮光，在另外20英尺范围内投射暗光。一旦这个属性被使用，在下一个黎明前都不能再次使用。",

As part of your reaction, you can expend a number of the shield's charges equal to the level of the spell (up to 6th level) to reflect that spell back at its source. You can't reflect a spell of 7th level or higher. When you reflect a spell in this way, the caster of the spell must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 1d8} radiant damage for each expended charge as a bolt of reflected arcane energy hits them. On a successful save, the damage is halved. If you reflect a spell in this way that would cause you to take half damage on a successful save, you take no damage instead.": "盾牌有10次充能，每天黎明时分恢复已消耗的充能次数（%0%）。当你抵御只针对你的法术效果的蓄力动作成功时，或者被法术攻击击中时，你可以用你的反应来学习该法术的等级。作为反应的一部分，你可以消耗与咒语等级相当的盾牌费用（最多6级），将该咒语反射回其来源。你不能反射7级或更高等级的法术。当你以这种方式反射法术时，施法者必须做一个{@dc 16}灵巧的蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，目标在反射的奥术能量击中他们时，每消耗一次电荷就会受到（%2%）辐射伤害。如果救赎成功，伤害会减半。如果你用这种方式反射法术，会使你在救赎成功时受到一半的伤害，那么你就不会受到伤害。",

You must use the same modifier for both rolls.": "当你与这根四分法杖调和时，它在你的手中保持稳固，但在你的脑海中却感觉很柔韧。你可以选择在使用此武器进行攻击和伤害卷时使用你的智力修正值，而不是力量。你必须在两个回合中使用相同的修正值。",
	"When you make an attack with this magic weapon, you can choose to make the attack at range. When you do, you use your mind to telekinetically curve the quarterstaff into the form of a {@item longbow|phb}. The bow is magically strung with an arcane energy that arcs between the rings on either end of the weapon. A glowing, magical arrow is formed whenever the arcing energy is drawn back. The arrow disappears after it hits a target. When you make a ranged attack with the quarterstaff in this way, the weapon is treated as if it were a magical longbow. This longbow can only use the ammunition that it generates and does not have the heavy property. While holding this weapon, you're proficient with this longbow when using it in this way.": "当你用这个魔法武器进行攻击时，你可以选择在范围内进行攻击。当你这样做时，你会用你的意念将四分法杖弯成一个（%0%）的形状。弓被神奇地串起了一种奥术能量，在武器两端的环之间划出弧线。每当弧形能量被拉回，就会形成一支发光的魔法箭。箭在射中目标后就会消失。当你以这种方式用四分法杖进行远程攻击时，该武器被视为魔法长弓。这种长弓只能使用它所产生的弹药，不具有重型属性。在持有这把武器时，以这种方式使用这把长弓时，你会精通这把长弓。",

When you do, the missiles are fired from either the bow or the quarterstaff's embossed faces.": "此外，这根四分法杖有8次充能，每天在黎明时分恢复{@dice 1d6 + 2}已消耗的充能。当你用这把武器采取{@action Attack}的行动时，你可以消耗它的1个充能，作为额外行动从四分法杖施放{@spell magic missile}的法术，而不是它的正常施放时间。当你这样做时，导弹会从弓箭或四叉戟的浮雕面发射。",
	"This adamantine war pick is specially designed to tear down walls. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever the war pick hits an object or structure, the hit is a critical hit. In addition, if you hit a magically created object or structure, such as a {@spell wall of ice}, with the war pick, you can choose to dispel the wall or object as if by the {@spell dispel magic} spell (6th-level version). The effect fails if the spell or magical effect that created the object or structure was cast using a 7th-level spell slot or higher.

	"An astral bracelet is a powerful magical bangle that allows its wearer to see, commune, or otherwise manifest things using powers beyond the Material Plane. The metal and glyphs of each bracelet are related to the kind of power that it holds. You can pull the bracelet off and hold it in the palm of your hand as an action. When you do, the bracelet unfurls to reveal the four inner rings collapsed within it, transforming the bracelet into an astronomical sphere. While the bracelet is transformed into the astronomical sphere, its inner rings slowly spin on their own.": "星际手镯是一种强大的魔法手镯，它可以让佩戴者看到、沟通或以其他方式使用超越物质世界的力量来表现事物。每个手镯的金属和字形都与它拥有的力量有关。你可以把手镯拉下来，作为一个动作把它放在你的手掌上。当你这样做时，手镯就会展开，露出折叠在其中的四个内环，将手镯转化为一个天文球。当手镯转化为天文球时，它的内环会慢慢地自行旋转。",

In addition, while you're in the Astral Plane, you always know the direction of the nearest portal to another plane of existence.": "这把金色的战镐是在星界深处锻造的，挥动时在它身后留下淡淡的星外能量痕迹。你使用这把魔法武器的攻击和伤害卷获得+3的奖励，被它击中的目标会受到额外的{@damage 1d4}攻击力伤害。此外，当你在星界的时候，你总是知道通往另一个存在面的最近的传送门的方向。",
	"This weapon has 4 charges and regains {@dice 1d3 + 1} expended charges each day at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of its charges to slam the war pick into any flat, solid surface at least 5 feet across in any direction. When you do, you create a small planar rift.

When a portal opens between two rifts and at least one of the rifts is attached to a creature, the attached creature or creatures must succeed on a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw or be immediately shunted through the portal to the other rift's location. Large and larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.": "此外，当你用它击中一个小型或大型的生物时，你可以消耗战斧的1次充电。当你这样做时，该生物会受到额外的（%0%）武力伤害，因为它的身体上会出现一个裂缝。以这种方式出现在生物身上的裂缝会附着在该生物身上，并随其移动，直到传送门被打开。当一个传送门在两个裂缝之间打开，并且至少有一个裂缝附着在一个生物身上时，被附着的生物必须在一个{@dc 17}魅力救赎中成功，否则会立即被传送门分流到另一个裂缝的位置。大的和更大的生物会自动成功地完成这个拯救动作。",

	"While holding this segmented, 1-foot-long rod, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to extend in either direction. The rod can extend up to 50 feet or as far as the surrounding space allows. If the rod touches another creature or surface before reaching its full length, the rod stops moving in that direction.

When you drop a coin in the piglet and stopper it, the figurine springs to life. When it does, it imprints on you and considers you its owner. The owner can hold and gently shake the piglet, causing it to oink happily, and magically know how much money is inside of it.": "这个陶瓷小猪塑像上了一层友好的粉红色涂层，触感柔软，顶部有一个孔，用软木塞塞住。当你在小猪身上投下一枚硬币并盖上塞子时，小猪就会活过来。当它这样做时，它会在你身上留下印记，并认为你是它的主人。主人可以拿着并轻轻摇晃小猪，使它高兴地叫起来，并神奇地知道它里面有多少钱。",

The piglet will spit out exact change when you or an ally asks for it, even converting them into larger or smaller denominations. The figurine can only hold coins and will spit or sneeze out anything else you place inside of it. The piglet squeals with glee and prances about excitedly when you deposit or feed it coins. The pig can eat up to 1000 coins of any denomination every hour it spends eating them. It will eat electrum pieces with less enthusiasm. It remains the same size regardless of how many coins are inside of it. The piglet is exceptionally loyal and will listen to commands given by its owner and other allied creatures of the owner's choosing. It walks beside you or its nearest ally as best it can, but vanishes into a pocket dimension if it is ever more than 30 feet away from one of you. The figurine can be summoned to you or another allied creature's location as a bonus action by saying the command phrase \"Come home, little piggy\".

	"When asking for 10% or more of its total stockpile, the piglet looks disappointed before carrying out the request.

All of the Remnants' effects and curses that were affecting the creature end.": "如果Dendallen的精神被击败，宿主生物会获得四级疲惫。此外，所有在当前存在平面上的丹达伦的残余物，即使是那些没有被宿主调和的残余物，都会变成泥浆，并随着固定丹达伦精神的魔法被驱散而被摧毁。所有影响该生物的残余物的效果和诅咒都会结束。",
	"If the spirit is victorious in combat and maintains its control over the host, it can spend 1 minute solidifying its ownership and possess the host. Once the creature is fully possessed in this way, the spirit of Dendallen can stay within the creature's body and command it indefinitely. The host creature shows no outward signs of the possessing spirit. While possessed in this way, the host automatically fails all saving throws against the spirit's thrall.": "如果精神在战斗中取得胜利并保持对宿主的控制，它可以花1分钟巩固其所有权并占有宿主。一旦生物以这种方式被完全占有，丹达伦的精神就可以留在生物的身体里，并无限期地指挥它。宿主生物不会显示出被附身的精神的外在迹象。在以这种方式附身的时候，宿主对精神的束缚的所有救赎都自动失败。",
	"While Dendallen is proud of his necromantic achievements, his step into undeath is a shameful setback. He will do whatever it takes to remain within the possessed creature and maintain his sense of life unless absolutely necessary. The spirit can reemerge from the possessed creature as an action. When this happens, the possessed creature can resume attempting saving throws to maintain its free will, but they suffer disadvantage on each of these attempts. Use the spirit of Dendallen's stat block and the possessed creature's statistics for these saving throws.": "虽然邓达伦为他的死灵法术成就感到自豪，但他踏入不死之身是一个可耻的挫折。除非万不得已，他将不惜一切代价留在被附身的生物体内，保持他的生命意识。灵魂可以作为一个动作从被附身的生物中重新出现。当这种情况发生时，被附身的生物可以继续尝试拯救术以保持其自由意志，但他们在每次尝试时都会受到不利影响。使用Dendallen精神的状态块和被附身的生物的统计数据来进行这些蓄力攻击。",

They are more often good than not, although some allow their vanity to turn to greed and evil.": "Feathren可以是水银泻地式的，并欣赏多样性和表达方式，因此倾向于倾向于混沌的温和方面。他们通常是善良的，尽管有些人允许他们的虚荣心转变成贪婪和邪恶。",

	"Reil's talons moved quickly across the surface, tearing through concepts with her charcoal on the paper as easily as flesh. Her piercing eyes darted about the page in search of ideas to explore. Finding none, she moved to a new sheet and put the old one atop the stack to the side.": "雷尔的爪子在纸面上快速移动，用她的炭笔在纸上撕开概念，就像肉一样容易。她那双刺眼的眼睛在纸上逡巡，寻找可以探索的想法。没有找到，她换了一张新的纸，把旧的放在一边。",
	"She stared at the now empty parchment in front of her and twirled the stick of charcoal in her hand. Her feathers were ruffled and the rings on her swinging tail clinked softly as they moved back and forth in concentration.": "她盯着她面前现在空空如也的羊皮纸，旋转着手中的木炭棒。她的羽毛被弄得乱七八糟，她摆动的尾巴上的环在集中精力的情况下来回移动，发出轻轻的叮当声。",
	"The sound of hammers against metal could be heard from workshop below, resonating with a familiar rhythm and ring that matched the pace of her thought, charcoal, and tail. She was a pendulum in motion: a clock that counted down to the stroke of brilliance, and when it rang out, the satisfied trills of victory would echo throughout the chamber.": "从下面的车间可以听到锤子敲打金属的声音，与熟悉的节奏和铃声相呼应，与她的思想、木炭和尾巴的节奏相匹配。她是一个运动中的钟摆：一个倒计时的时钟，当它响起时，胜利的颤音将回荡在整个室内。",
	"Feathren are the representation of something new from something old. A step beyond their ancestral griffon heritage, these bipedal creatures celebrate their individuality amidst the cries and jeers from common folk. Originally born from the Astral Plane, where all things can be lost, found, and remade, feathren now walk the Material Plane in search of new ideas, materials, and direction. Filled with endless curiosity, many make their way through the world as adventurers and artisans, taking care to learn what they can from their experiences before moving on to the next one.": "Feathren是旧事物中新事物的代表。这些双足生物超越了他们祖先的狮鹫遗产，在普通人的呼喊和嘲笑声中庆祝他们的个性。羽毛人最初诞生于星界，在那里所有的东西都可以丢失、找到和重新制作，现在他们在物质界行走，寻找新的想法、材料和方向。充满了无尽的好奇心，许多人以冒险家和工匠的身份在这个世界上闯荡，在进入下一个世界之前小心翼翼地从他们的经历中学习他们能够学到的东西。",
	"Feathren unite remarkable aspects of two otherwise disparate species. Their strong legs are feline, while their chest, arms, and head are avian. Despite their distant relation to griffons, feathren stand upright as and can use their sharp talons to manipulate objects as deftly as any other humanoid. Their voices often bear some bird-like resemblance to their ancestry and contain the occasional trill, coo, or caw.": "Feathren结合了两个原本不同的物种的显著方面。他们强壮的腿是猫科动物，而他们的胸部、手臂和头部是鸟类。尽管他们与狮鹫有着遥远的关系，但feathren直立起来，并能像其他人形生物一样，用他们锋利的爪子巧妙地操纵物体。他们的声音通常与他们的祖先有一些鸟类的相似之处，并含有偶尔的颤音、咕咕声或叫声。",
	"Few feathren look the same. Their fur, plumage, and build can vary widely, forming unique combinations of origin and aptitude. While some feathren are born with the body of an eagle and lion, others combine the likes of owls and crows with tigers and leopards. Feathren find particular pleasure in jewelry and decoration: an inescapable personality trait from their heritage. Without wings to embellish, most turn to adorning themselves with baubles and rings on their talons, feathered ears, and tail. Others enjoy body art, such as tattoos, paints, and other unique means of self-expression. Most feathren struggle to resist the urge to preen or adjust their worn finery whenever they catch a glimpse of their reflection.": "很少有feathren看起来是一样的。他们的皮毛、羽翼和身材可以有很大的不同，形成独特的起源和能力组合。有些feathren生来就有鹰和狮子的身体，而另一些则结合了猫头鹰和乌鸦与老虎和豹子的喜好。Feathren在珠宝和装饰方面找到了特别的乐趣：这是他们遗产中不可避免的个性特征。由于没有翅膀可以装饰，大多数人转而用爪子、羽毛耳朵和尾巴上的小饰品和戒指来装饰自己。其他人则喜欢身体艺术，如纹身、颜料和其他独特的自我表达方式。每当他们瞥见自己的倒影时，大多数羽人都会努力克制自己的冲动，去打扮或调整自己穿戴的装饰品。",
	"Born with the innate gifts of two naturally skilled creatures, feathren have a shared sense of confidence in their abilities. Feathren spend their lives learning and mastering new trades to sate their curiosity, preferring to answer a puzzle or question on their own rather than ask for help. Many feathren find camaraderie among those that share a common passion, and while they're remiss to turn to peers for help, they enjoy the sharing of stories and conversation about their interests.": "生来就有两种自然技能的天赋，feathren对自己的能力有一种共同的自信感。Feathren一生都在学习和掌握新的行业，以满足他们的好奇心，他们更愿意自己回答一个谜题或问题，而不是向别人寻求帮助。许多feathren在那些有共同爱好的人中找到了友谊，虽然他们不愿意向同伴寻求帮助，但他们喜欢分享故事和谈论他们的兴趣。",
	"As is their nature, feathren enjoy experimenting with names and playing with the combinations they can make with them. Feathren are given a name at birth that's used as a first name, but give themselves new surnames as they grow.": "就像他们的天性一样，feathren喜欢试验名字，并玩弄他们可以做出的组合。Feathren在出生时就会有一个作为名字使用的名字，但随着他们的成长，会给自己起新的姓氏。",
	"Throughout a feathren's lifespan, they may go through as many as twenty surnames: some may last for years, while others are kept for mere weeks.

	"Despite their intelligence, many people see feathren as little more than walking, talking griffons. As a result, they're often treated with the same caution their large ancestors receive, but unless given a reason to be afraid, most people will simply steal glances at them from across the way or avoid them all together. Someone familiar with griffons can be as likely to belittle a feathren as they are to befriend them, depending on that person's history.": "尽管他们很聪明，但在许多人看来，feathren不过是会走路、会说话的狮鹫。因此，他们经常受到与他们的大型祖先一样的谨慎对待，但除非有理由害怕，否则大多数人只会从对面偷看他们，或者完全避开他们。熟悉狮鹫的人可能会轻视狮鹫，也可能会与它们交好，这取决于这个人的历史。",
	"Those that see past a feathren's ancestry find themselves with a lasting companion. Dragonborn, dwarves, gnomes, and half-elves in particular are likely to be befriended by feathren, who see them as either natural creative peers or kindred spirits caught between worlds. Half-orcs and tieflings can spark this same sense of camaraderie, but often lack the creative drive that can cement a lifelong friendship.": "那些看透了feathren的祖先的人发现他们有一个持久的伙伴。龙裔、矮人、地精和半精灵特别容易与feathren结为朋友，他们把他们看作是天生的创造性伙伴或夹在世界之间的同类。半兽人和铁皮人也能激发这种友情，但往往缺乏能够巩固终身友谊的创造性动力。",
	"Born from the frigid and daunting Everglacier, barbarians who follow Path of the Glacier have learned to harbor the resolute stillness, patience, and unwavering determination and destruction of the icy landscape.
