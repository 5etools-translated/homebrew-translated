	"I remember the first time I saw a tabletop role-playing game book, more than twenty years ago. It was an exotic strange thing and after flicking a few pages... it hit me, I could finally re-live the adventures of the Lord of the Rings and of Final Fantasy VII with my friends, around a table, no limitations whatsoever, just us and pure imagination. I was hooked, and I have been ever since.": "我记得我第一次看到桌面角色扮演游戏书，是在20多年前。这是一个异国情调的奇怪东西，在翻了几页之后......我突然意识到，我终于可以和我的朋友们围着桌子重新体验《指环王》和《最终幻想7》的冒险，没有任何限制，只有我们和纯粹的想象力。我被迷住了，而且一直到现在。",
	"Table-top RPGs have influenced me to the point that my very career as a video-game designer is built on that moment–that young black kid did not know it, but magic had entered his life, never to leave again.": "桌面RPG游戏影响了我，以至于我作为视频游戏设计师的职业生涯建立在那个时刻--那个年轻的黑人孩子并不知道，但魔法已经进入他的生活，再也不会离开。",
	"But that was not the end of the story, something was missing. For many years, every character I created and almost every NPC and culture in my stories did not look like me. For a long time I did not question this, I just accepted it as a fact: people who looked like me simply did not belong to Fantasy.": "但这并不是故事的结束，还缺少一些东西。许多年来，我创造的每个角色和我故事中的几乎每个NPC和文化都不像我。在很长一段时间里，我没有质疑这一点，我只是接受了这个事实：长得像我的人根本不属于幻想。",
	"As I grew older, I saw how this happened in basically every facet of our society, certain voices are systematically left unheard, or worse.": "随着我年龄的增长，我看到这种情况基本上发生在我们社会的每一个方面，某些声音被系统地忽略了，或者更糟。",
	"So eventually, I had a second awakening. I have been blessed with being the son of a single African woman that, in spite of all adversities, always made sure her children proudly knew where they came from. It is time for me to take this blessing and bring it to games.": "所以最终，我有了第二次觉醒。我有幸成为一位单身非洲妇女的儿子，尽管面临各种逆境，但她总是确保她的孩子自豪地知道他们来自哪里。现在是我带着这份祝福，把它带到游戏中的时候了。",
	"Wagadu does not come from a place of anger but rather from one of love. When you love something you want more of it, and you want to make it better. This book is just a first step, a first little step that I wish my awkward 14 years old me had been able to witness; I wish that, as he was planning the next adventure with his friends, those wonderful books had whispered to him \"Black and queer is beautiful, be the hero you truly want to be!\". Well now I am screaming it at the top of my lungs, enjoy.": "Wagadu不是来自愤怒的地方，而是来自爱的地方。当你爱某样东西时，你会想要更多的东西，你想让它变得更好。这本书只是第一步，我希望我14岁的尴尬的我能够见证的第一小步；我希望在他和他的朋友们计划下一次冒险时，那些美妙的书对他说：\"黑人和同性恋者是美丽的，成为你真正想成为的英雄！\"。好了，现在我正大声地喊着，请欣赏。",
	"Great that you asked! I can tell you that if you wondered, it's very likely not. Are you here to understand, celebrate and support the cultures behind this book? Or are you here to mock them and belittle them?": "很好，你问了! 我可以告诉你，如果你想知道，很可能不是。你在这里是为了理解、庆祝和支持这本书背后的文化吗？还是在这里嘲笑他们，贬低他们？",
	"After centuries of cultural annihilation, of cities and temples burned to the ground, of languages and scripts banned and of people chained and humiliated, we believe it's time for Black cultures to shine. This can happen through all types of media; through movies such as Black Panther, through music such as Black is King and even through games, such as this book and its upcoming videogame counterpart.": "在经历了几个世纪的文化湮灭，城市和寺庙被烧毁，语言和文字被禁止，人们被锁住并受到羞辱之后，我们相信现在是黑人文化大放异彩的时候。这可以通过所有类型的媒体发生；通过电影，如《黑豹》，通过音乐，如《黑人为王》，甚至通过游戏，如这本书和即将推出的电子游戏对应物。",
	"We want Black cultures and fantasies to gain a foothold in mainstream society. Japan has benefited from the wide adoption of its cultural \"tropes\" such as the Samurai or Ninja. Japanese creators are better off, have wider audiences and more respect & recognition of their culture.": "我们希望黑人文化和幻想能在主流社会中获得立足点。日本已经从广泛采用其文化 \"套路\"（如武士或忍者）中受益。日本的创作者处境更好，有更多的观众，他们的文化得到更多的尊重和认可。",
	"If you wish us well, please play and spread the word, it's a little act of rebellion to all the oppression that we have endured. Colonial masters and slave traders wanted our cultures and history to disappear and they would definitely not be pleased to see you celebrate them with us—so do it.": "如果你希望我们好，请播放并传播这个消息，这是对我们所承受的所有压迫的一个小小的反叛行为。殖民时期的主人和奴隶贩子希望我们的文化和历史消失，他们肯定不会高兴看到你和我们一起庆祝，所以要做。",
	"Let's normalise Afrofantasy, help us make it mainstream—if you come with respect and an open mind, we embrace you and look forward to sharing the wonders of Wagadu with you.": "让我们把非洲幻想正常化，帮助我们把它变成主流--如果你带着尊重和开放的心态来，我们会拥抱你，并期待着与你分享瓦加杜的奇迹。",
	"I hope you enjoy this. But in this book you will probably find some typos or other issues—we did the best we could, but being bootstrapped and creating this content for free did not allow us to spend even more time to make this even more awesome.": "我希望你喜欢这个。但在这本书中，你可能会发现一些错别字或其他问题--我们已经尽了最大努力，但由于是自筹资金和免费创建这些内容，我们不允许花更多的时间来使这本书更棒。",
	"Why is this free you will ask then? Couldn't you just have sold it?": "那么你会问为什么这是免费的？你就不能把它卖掉吗？",
	"The company Twin Drums is not just a game-development company, we want to change the perception of fantasy and role-playing, give visibility to black aesthetics and African ancient mythology as it has never been done before within our collective imagination.": "双鼓公司不仅仅是一家游戏开发公司，我们想改变人们对幻想和角色扮演的看法，让黑人美学和非洲古代神话在我们的集体想象中得到彰显，这是前所未有的。",
	"Releasing this for free is the best way to ensure this can go wide and far and that even those who cannot afford it (and sadly it's often people who look like the characters in this book) can put their hands on it and dive into Wagadu with friends!": "免费发布这本书是确保这本书能够广而告之的最好方式，即使那些买不起的人（可悲的是，往往是那些看起来像书中人物的人）也能把它放在手上，和朋友们一起潜入瓦加杜!",
	"If you do have some spare cash and want to do something we do have two recommendations:": "如果你确实有一些闲钱，想做一些事情，我们确实有两个建议。",
	"People like us who wrote this and like the Wagadu's characters are still struggling for equality and dignity. Pick an African or diasporic charity and feel free to tag us on social media. This would bring us joy. Some suggestions {@link here|https://www.aidforafrica.org/member-charities/all-members/} and {@link here|https://nymag.com/strategist/article/where-to-donate-for-black-lives-matter.html}.": "像我们这样写这篇文章的人，也像瓦加杜的人物一样，仍在为平等和尊严而奋斗。挑选一个非洲或散居的慈善机构，并随时在社交媒体上标记我们。这将给我们带来欢乐。一些建议（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"If, additionally, you still have any spare cash, consider supporting us on Kickstarter, we'll be there in a few weeks, looking for backers and funding for a bigger, much more in depth 5E setting book of Wagadu and for its companion online videogame.": "如果你还有闲钱，可以考虑在Kickstarter上支持我们，我们将在几周后在那里为一本更大、更深入的5E设定的《瓦加杜》及其配套的在线视频游戏寻找支持者和资金。",
	"We are creating an online safe space where people can roleplay and stay in character just as around a pen&paper table and we are very excited about that!": "我们正在创建一个在线的安全空间，人们可以在这里进行角色扮演，并保持角色，就像在纸笔桌旁一样，我们对此感到非常兴奋！\"。",

	"Thank you, Allan.": "谢谢你，阿兰。",
	"Wagadu can be described as some sort of purgatory, a strange and wild place where people from the Upper Realms, the prosperous and more peaceful place where everyone hails from, \"fall\" and are stuck for good.": "瓦加杜可以被描述为某种炼狱，一个奇怪而狂野的地方，在那里，来自上层世界的人，即每个人都来自的繁荣和更和平的地方，会 \"堕落 \"并永远被困。",
	"No one knows exactly why people fall into Wagadu but what is clear is that it's an irreversible process and that the only thing that the Fallen can do is band together to survive the beautiful and harsh world of Wagadu.": "没有人确切地知道人们为什么会堕入瓦加杜，但清楚的是，这是一个不可逆转的过程，堕落者唯一能做的就是团结起来，在瓦加杜这个美丽而严酷的世界中生存下去。",
	"Powerful spirits, fickle ancestors, angry beasts and magical weathers are only some of the challenges that the Fallen face but on the other hand, fertile soils, powerful magic and powerful traditions to be revived are there to reward the hardiest survivors.": "强大的精神、善变的祖先、愤怒的野兽和神奇的天气只是堕落者面临的部分挑战，但另一方面，肥沃的土壤、强大的魔法和有待恢复的强大传统都是为了奖励最顽强的幸存者。",
	"Most of this book does not make clear lore distinctions between the Upper Realms (Sometimes called \"The Upper Worlds\") and Wagadu: most cultures, creatures and even historical facts, such as Empires, are shared between the two. That is because the Fallen constantly bring ideas and cultures with them when they get thrown into Wagadu.": "本书的大部分内容都没有对上层世界（有时称为 \"上层世界\"）和瓦加杜进行明确的传说区分：大多数文化、生物，甚至历史事实，如帝国，都是两者之间共享。这是因为堕落者在被扔进瓦加杜的时候，会不断带来一些想法和文化。",
	"On average though, one can expect Wagadu's versions of things to \"wilder\" more fragmented and adventurous. For instance where as an Asiman Empire might stand for 2000 years in the Upper Worlds, its Wagadu reincarnation would span a few cycles, falling into ruins in between and maybe even being overrun by Spirit overlords for a couple of centuries–additionally it might be much more diverse that its \"original\" counterpart, with people of all lineages flocking to its safety.": "不过平均而言，人们可以预期瓦加杜的事物版本会更加 \"狂野\"，更加支离破碎和冒险。例如，阿西曼帝国可能会在上层世界屹立2000年，而瓦加杜的转世则会跨越几个周期，在这期间陷入废墟，甚至可能被精神霸主占领几个世纪--此外，它可能比它的 \"原始 \"对应物更加多样化，各种血统的人都会涌向它的安全地带。",
	"Wagadu is inhabited by all sorts of people, members of every lineage from all walks of life, but every single wagadian you'll meet in your adventures was not born there: they all \"fell\" from the Upper World.": "瓦加杜居住着各种各样的人，各行各业的成员，但你在冒险中遇到的每一个瓦加杜人都不是在那里出生的：他们都是从上层世界 \"坠落 \"的。",
	"To those who remember it, the Fall felt like losing their senses while being about their activities in the Upper World, to others it felt like entering a vivid dream while asleep.": "对那些记得它的人来说，堕落的感觉就像失去了他们的感官，而他们在上层世界的活动，对其他人来说，感觉就像在睡觉时进入一个生动的梦。",
	"To people in Wagadu, new Fallen appear like bright stars, burning through the sky before plummeting to the ground. The Fallen are usually protected by an egg-shell which cracks after impact, allowing the naked, slimy and confused person to make their way out. Unfortunately not all Fallen survive the impact either dying in the egg or crawling out to be greeted by one of the dangers of Wagadu before any help can make it on time.": "对于瓦加杜的人来说，新的堕落者就像明亮的星星，在天空中燃烧，然后坠落到地面。堕落者通常被一个蛋壳保护着，蛋壳在撞击后会裂开，让赤裸的、粘稠的和困惑的人走出来。不幸的是，并不是所有的堕落者都能在撞击中存活下来，要么死在蛋里，要么在任何帮助及时到达之前，爬出来迎接他们的是瓦加杜的危险之一。",
	"One thing that all people in Wagadu share is the memory loss that follows the Fall. For some people it is just big gaps in their life and for others it is as bad as not even knowing their name. Additionally recollections from the Upper World cannot be 100% trusted: they could be \"egg memories\"; the Fall is known to scramble people's minds and there is more than one story of old friends from the Upper World finding each other in Wagadu only to discover that they have very different versions of their shared experiences.": "所有在瓦加杜的人都有一个共同点，那就是秋天后的失忆。对一些人来说，这只是他们生活中的巨大空白，而对另一些人来说，这甚至是不知道自己的名字。此外，来自上层世界的回忆不能被100%信任：它们可能是 \"鸡蛋记忆\"；众所周知，堕落会扰乱人们的思维，不止一个故事，上层世界的老朋友们在瓦加杜找到彼此，却发现他们对共同经历有非常不同的说法。",
	"It's an ancient and unbroken tradition for people of all cultures to offer help to the freshly Fallen and when falling stars brighten the sky someone is usually dispatched to find and help the new arrivals.": "所有文化背景的人都会向刚刚坠落的人提供帮助，这是一个古老而未被打破的传统，当坠落的星星照亮天空时，通常会派人去寻找和帮助新来的人。",
	"If such parties don't find the Fallen and help them with food and equipment, very often ancestors and more rarely spirits, offer help. Yellow simple robes are typically given to the newly fallen.": "如果这样的队伍没有找到堕落者并以食物和设备帮助他们，往往是祖先和更少的精神，提供帮助。黄色的简单长袍通常会被送给新的堕落者。",
	"Falling patterns are mysterious but do not seem to be entirely random. Sometimes a disproportionate number of Asiman might fall in the vicinity of an ancient oasis city for instance, other times the patterns are indiscernible and some are even known to have fallen in the middle of the ocean (without being water-breathing Ikakis or Ndyams).": "坠落模式是神秘的，但似乎并不完全是随机的。例如，有时在一个古老的绿洲城市附近可能会有不成比例的阿西曼坠落，其他时候的模式是无法辨认的，有些甚至被认为是坠落在海洋中央（不属于会水的伊卡基斯或恩迪亚姆）。",
	"Children born in Wagadu invariably grow up to join the spirit world which means that the only way to replenish cities and villages is through new Fallen; when people stop falling a slow decline sets in which leads inexorably to the extinction of every living person in Wagadu.": "在瓦加杜出生的孩子长大后都会加入精神世界，这意味着补充城市和村庄的唯一途径是通过新的堕落者；当人们停止堕落时，就会出现缓慢的衰退，这将不可避免地导致瓦加杜的每个活人的灭绝。",
	"After an extinction, whenever someone falls, a new Cycle begins. A cycle can last one generation or in some rare cases even centuries, as long as people keep falling and replenishing Wagadu. People typically fall in \"showers\" which means irregular waves of people at different times and places.": "灭绝之后，只要有人倒下，新的周期就开始了。一个周期可以持续一代人，或者在一些罕见的情况下，甚至几个世纪，只要人们不断坠落，补充瓦加杜。人们通常以 \"阵雨 \"的方式坠落，这意味着在不同的时间和地点出现不规则的人潮。",
	"The only reason why some cities and civilisations in Wagadu sometimes spans through Cycles is because they either reflect some ongoing state of things in the Upper World or because ancestors in Wagadu bestow the new Fallen with knowledge to carry on specific legacies and traditions.": "为什么瓦加杜的一些城市和文明有时会跨越周期，唯一的原因是它们反映了上层世界的一些持续状态，或者是因为瓦加杜的祖先赋予新的堕落者以知识，使其继承特定的遗产和传统。",
	"Especially for level 1 characters, the recommended start is having players fall into Wagadu at the beginning of the campaign and have either ancestors or a search party provide them with equipment. Of course you can play an already fallen character too but it's important you flesh out how long ago they fell and how much they know about Wagadu in that Cycle.": "特别是对于1级的角色，推荐的开始是让玩家在战役开始时堕入瓦加杜，并由祖先或搜索队为他们提供装备。当然，你也可以扮演一个已经堕落的角色，但重要的是你要充实他们堕落的时间以及他们在那个周期内对瓦加杜的了解程度。",
	"Wagadu is formed by several archipelagos and a few larger lands that often have widely differing climates even within one island. Typically Wagadu's biomes are the savanna, the desert, the rainforest, the swamps and the mountains. On average they all tend to be quite hot, with mountains being the coolest (sometimes even snowcapped). Wagadu has two big seasons, the dry and the rainy seasons. During the dry season, many waterways shrink or dry up, grass withers and some trees shed their leaves while in the rainy season, lakes and rivers swell and nature grows lush and verdant.": "瓦加杜由几个群岛和一些较大的土地组成，即使在一个岛上，气候也有很大差异。典型的瓦加杜生物群落是草原、沙漠、雨林、沼泽和山脉。平均而言，它们都相当炎热，山区最凉爽（有时甚至是白雪皑皑）。瓦加杜有两个大的季节，旱季和雨季。在旱季，许多水道萎缩或干涸，草地枯萎，一些树木落叶，而在雨季，湖泊和河流膨胀，大自然变得郁郁葱葱。",
	"A peculiar aspect of Wagadu is that between Cycles, when bereft of people, the land seems to shift and warp in outlandish ways, with entire cities moving to other parts of Wagadu and climate and lands changing. Interestingly sometimes two very distant Cycles end up having more or less the same layout but this is not the norm.": "瓦加杜的一个奇特之处在于，在两个周期之间，当没有人的时候，土地似乎会以奇怪的方式转变和扭曲，整个城市会搬到瓦加杜的其他地方，气候和土地也会改变。有趣的是，有时两个相距甚远的轮回最终会有或多或少的相同布局，但这并不是常态。",
	"Some landmarks seem to be recurrent in most if not all versions of Wagadu's lands and some of the most famous are:": "一些地标似乎在大多数甚至所有版本的瓦加杜的土地上反复出现，其中最著名的一些是。",
	"a long scenic waterfall which has massive stone masks carved behind the water sheet. Powerful spirits reside in and around it.": "这是一个长长的风景瀑布，水面后有巨大的石雕面具。强大的神灵居住在它的内部和周围。",
	"an ancient ruined city which is said to have hosted a civilisation that embraced all lineages, now teeming with aggressive Red Ancestors.": "一座古老的废墟城市，据说曾承载过一个包容所有血统的文明，现在充斥着咄咄逼人的红色祖先。",
	"An exceedingly vast and ancient Iroko tree that always appears surrounded by mist, strange fireflies and fetish statues. It houses a \"grandma\" spirit said to be as old as Wagadu.": "一棵极其巨大而古老的伊罗科树，总是出现在雾气、奇怪的萤火虫和拜物教雕像的包围之中。它容纳了一个 \"祖母 \"的灵魂，据说和瓦加杜一样古老。",
	"so called for their snow covered peaks, these are two very high dormant Volcanoes that are known to have awakened in some Cycles.": "这两座非常高的休眠火山因其被雪覆盖的山峰而得名，据说在某些周期中会被唤醒。",
	"a racing river always flows through this majestic Canyon which hosts more wildlife and spirits than it might appear at a first look at its barren rocks.": "一条奔腾不息的河流始终流经这个雄伟的峡谷，它所承载的野生动物和精神比乍一看其荒芜的岩石可能更多。",
	"two large wagadian rivers always invariably flow to a depression in some large landmass. This swampy terrain becomes a true water labyrinth during the rain season and is known to host some mysterious rock totems.": "两条瓦格达大河总是不约而同地流向某个大地块的洼地。这片沼泽地在雨季会变成真正的水迷宫，而且众所周知，这里有一些神秘的岩石图腾。",
	"A large, naturally lit, cave that contains an ancient Ironmaster city and forges set to enhance blacksmithing skills. Angry spirits invariably roam its grounds and only in rare Cycles have people wrestled control of the place.": "一个巨大的、自然光照的洞穴，里面有一个古老的铁匠城和用于提高铁匠技能的锻炉。愤怒的灵魂总是在这里游荡，只有在罕见的循环中，人们才会争夺对这个地方的控制权。",
	"this large volcanic crater was cursed eons ago and even its nature appears strange and warped. Red Ancestors live inside and are said to attack any person who gets too close. In some Cycles these ancestors have mysteriously decided to bring the reign of terror beyond their lands.": "这个大火山口在很久以前就被诅咒了，甚至它的性质也显得奇怪和扭曲。红色的祖先住在里面，据说会攻击任何太接近的人。在一些周期中，这些祖先神秘地决定将恐怖统治带到他们的土地之外。",
	"this is said to be a beautiful verdant island inhabited exclusively by Black Ancestors that bless anyone who makes it through its mysty wards. It never stays in one place, magically moving all the time.": "据说这是一个美丽的绿色岛屿，只居住着黑祖宗，他们祝福任何通过其神秘的病房的人。它从不停留在一个地方，一直在神奇地移动。",
	"this group of massive Baobab trees host a number of ancient spirits said to collectively know everything about Wagadu. The challenge is to get them to speak and then to interpret their arcane utterings.": "这群巨大的猴面包树上有许多古老的神灵，据说他们共同了解瓦加杜的一切。挑战在于如何让他们开口说话，然后解释他们神秘的话语。",
	"this impenetrable, drizzle coated rainforest is known for how easy it is to walk into the Spirit worlds. It is a dangerous place with dormant guardians, wild spirits and what seem to be exceedingly ancient Emere ruins.": "这片密不透风、布满细雨的雨林因很容易走入灵界而闻名。这是一个危险的地方，有休眠的守护者、野性的精神和似乎是极其古老的埃米尔遗迹。",
	"a place in the middle of the seas which houses several vortexes and strange currents. Ikakis consider it most sacred. Many adventurers attempting its waves never came back.": "在海洋中间的一个地方，有几个漩涡和奇怪的水流。伊卡基斯人认为它是最神圣的。许多冒险家尝试了它的波浪，却再也没有回来。",
	"this walled Asiman city sits in the middle of a depression dotted by outlandish salt lakes, small volcanoes and mighty geysers. It gets inhabited in most Cycles.": "这座有墙的阿西曼城坐落在一个洼地的中间，上面点缀着奇特的盐湖、小火山和强大的间歇喷泉。它在大多数周期都有人居住。",
	"numbering between 3 and 7, depending on the Cycle, these giant Mangroves appear to be connected to each other in mystical ways, sometimes even providing magic travel.": "根据周期的不同，这些巨型红树林的数量在3到7之间，它们似乎以神秘的方式相互连接，有时甚至提供神奇的旅行。",
	"an impossibly jutting outcrop, surrounded by elephant bones, that is known to bless the flight capabilities of Daa'ima and is holy to worshippers of the Moon Goddess.": "一个不可能的突起，周围是大象的骨头，据说可以保佑达伊玛的飞行能力，是月亮女神崇拜者的圣地。",
	"this large Savanna village is home is always placed in some strategic crossings and it is a double city governed conjointly by Swalas and Lionbloods. In Cycles in which it does not get inhabited it still houses benevolent Black Spirits.": "这个大的萨凡纳村的家总是位于一些战略性的交叉点，它是一个由斯瓦拉人和狮血人共同管理的双重城市。在没有人居住的循环中，它仍然居住着仁慈的黑灵。",
	"(or \"Scorpion's sea\") Wagadu's biggest desert consists of endless dunes, rocky plateaus and lush oases. Dangerous ruins and entire spirit villages can be found as well.": "(或 \"蝎子的海\"）瓦加杜最大的沙漠由无尽的沙丘、岩石高原和茂盛的绿洲组成。还可以发现危险的遗迹和整个精神村落。",
	"A vast plateau known to house the ruins and in some cycles the remnants of one of the only Daa'ima kingdoms which ever existed.": "一片广袤的高原，已知的废墟，在某些周期里，是唯一存在过的达伊玛王国之一的遗迹。",
	"(the Water Rock) this city in the middle of the ocean was first funded by Ikakis and Ndyams who convinced a powerful water spirit to become their totem. Now it floats in the middle of the boat-houses, protecting them from the worst storms. It's size varies across Cycles.": "(水岩）这座位于海洋中央的城市最初是由伊卡基斯和恩迪亚姆资助的，他们说服了一个强大的水精灵成为他们的图腾。现在它漂浮在船屋的中间，保护他们免受最严重的风暴。它的大小在不同的周期里是不同的。",
	"this large and picturesque gathering of trading spirits happens on magical clearing that can be found only when it wants to be found.": "这种大型的、风景如画的贸易精神集会发生在神奇的空地上，只有当它想被发现时才能被发现。",
	"always placed on a misty plateau, this city is capital of the kingdom of the Dama spirits from which they ruled other spirits and sometimes (especially in the sixt era) people as well.": "这座城市总是坐落在一个迷雾重重的高原上，是达摩神灵王国的首都，他们从这里统治其他神灵，有时（特别是在第六世纪）也统治人类。",
	"The focus of this setting is on what happens when people fall into Wagadu but the Upper Realms are important background info. Most likely crucial details such as what lineage a player belongs too and what training they underwent, happened in the Upper Realms.": "这个设定的重点是人们落入瓦加杜后会发生什么，但上层世界是重要的背景信息。最有可能的关键细节，如玩家属于什么血统，他们接受了什么训练，都发生在上层世界。",
	"Nevertheless, the memory loss that accompanies the Fall, implies that the Upper Realms do not need to be described in too much detail for a player to describe what happened in their \"previous life\". The Upper Realms are such a distant memory that a minority of Wagadians even claim that they actually do not exist and are just a strange hallucination that people have when they are born with the Fall.": "然而，伴随着堕落的记忆丧失，意味着上层世界不需要被描述得太详细，玩家就可以描述他们的 \"前世 \"发生了什么。上层世界是如此遥远的记忆，以至于少数瓦加迪人甚至声称它们实际上并不存在，只是人们在出生时因堕落而产生的一种奇怪的幻觉。",
	"No two maps of Wagadu during a Cycle are exactly the same, though many might resemble each other. Sometimes changes might appear even during a Cycle, often after some cataclysm or world-changing event.": "在一个周期内，没有两张瓦加杜的地图是完全相同的，尽管许多地图可能彼此相似。有时甚至在一个周期内也会出现变化，通常是在一些大灾变或改变世界的事件之后。",
	"Another important factor is that the very spiritual rules that govern \"natural laws\" might change depending on which Families of spirits have the upper hands. These are some example of fluctuations betweens Cycles:": "另一个重要因素是，支配 \"自然法则 \"的精神规则可能会改变，这取决于哪个家族的精神占据上风。这些是两个周期之间波动的一些例子。",
	"In most Cycles when a creature, including a player, dies of anything that is not old age they usually are \"reborn\" in some specific spot. Often it's by the totem of their village but in some Cycles it's some other specific or random location. In rare Cycles, when the spirits of Death have more influence, passing away is permanent though even in such instances there are some spells that can bring you back from afterlife.": "在大多数循环中，当一个生物，包括一个玩家，死于任何非老年性的疾病时，他们通常会在某个特定的地方 \"重生\"。通常是在他们村子的图腾边上，但在一些循环中，则是其他特定或随机的地点。在罕见的循环中，当死神的灵魂有更大的影响力时，死亡是永久性的，尽管即使在这种情况下，也有一些法术可以使你从来世复活。",
	"When peace spirits are very powerful, Fallen can't physically harm each other. Any attempt to intentionally injure another does not succeed. In such Cycles people sometimes still find other ways to harm each other (such as coaxing Red Ancestors or monsters against each other) but in many happy instances, this allows all Fallen to more easily band together to deal with the dangers of Wagadu.": "当和平的精神非常强大时，堕落者不能在身体上伤害对方。任何试图故意伤害他人的行为都不会成功。在这样的循环中，人们有时仍会找到其他方式来伤害对方（如哄骗红衣祖先或怪物来对付对方），但在许多快乐的例子中，这让所有堕落者更容易团结起来，应对瓦加杜的危险。",
	"Many Cycles have hybrids of the above with areas where mutual harm is possible or not and areas where rebirth is guaranteed or where death is irreversible.": "许多周期有上述的混合体，有可能或没有相互伤害的区域，也有保证重生或死亡不可逆转的区域。",
	"Many sorts of other variations have been described by Wagadu's Ancestors, including Cycles where everyone could breathe underwater, magic was almost absent, anyone could travel magically long distance or telepathy was ubiquitous. These Cycles appear to be much rarer.": "瓦加杜的祖先们还描述了许多其他变化，包括每个人都可以在水下呼吸、魔法几乎不存在、任何人都可以用魔法进行长途旅行或心灵感应无处不在的循环。这些循环似乎要稀少得多。",
	"Most of Wagadu's history is kept by Black Ancestor griots(bards) that appear during each Cycle, especially at its beginning, to recite the stories of past generations and places. To a lesser extent Spirits too contribute to the Fallen's knowledge though their focus tends to be narrower and their tellings more cryptic. The result is that every new Cycle of Fallen has knowledge of Wagadu but people can never be 100% sure about the accuracy of the information they get.": "瓦加杜的大部分历史是由黑祖先吟游诗人保存的，他们在每个周期中出现，特别是在周期开始时，背诵过去几代人和地方的故事。在较小的程度上，精灵们也为堕落者的知识做出了贡献，尽管他们的关注点往往比较狭窄，他们的讲述也比较隐晦。其结果是，每一个新的堕落者周期都有关于瓦加杜的知识，但人们永远无法100%确定他们得到的信息是否准确。",
	"Some facts seems to appear coherently in most stories and are quickly considered \"common knowledge\" by the Fallen:": "一些事实似乎连贯地出现在大多数故事中，并很快被堕落者视为 \"常识\"。",

	"a mythical time of which little is known. The lineage composition was very different and even the gods of those days were not as we know them now. Ancestors from these Eras are seen rarely and are very difficult to comprehend.": "一个鲜为人知的神话时代。世系的构成非常不同，甚至当时的神也不是我们现在所知的那样。这些时代的祖先很少见到，而且非常难以理解。",
	"a period of very challenging and dangerous Cycles in which distrust between different cultures and communities was high. Patriarchies or Matriarchies hardened and ancestors from this Cycles are still recognisable by their severe and sometimes outlandish views on social mores.": "这是一个非常具有挑战性和危险性的阶段，不同文化和社区之间的不信任程度很高。父权制或母权制变得很强硬，这个周期的祖先仍然可以通过他们对社会风俗的严厉和有时离经叛道的看法来识别。",
	"considered to be a golden time by many griots, many magnificent ruins across the islands are from this time. Its last Cycles saw violent disruptions by Red Ancestors which led to the inability to rebuild and continue those ancient kingdoms. Black Ancestors from this Era are nostalgic and try to help people rebuild lost glories.": "被许多格里特人认为是一个黄金时代，整个岛屿的许多宏伟的遗迹都来自这个时代。它的最后一个周期出现了红色祖先的暴力破坏，导致无法重建和继续那些古老的王国。这个时代的黑祖先是怀旧的，试图帮助人们重建失去的辉煌。",
	"Many of its Cycles saw Spirit Families create vast kingdoms and rule people directly, sometimes benevolently but more often in harsh and alien ways. Ancestors of this Era tend to be more shy and humble, often providing invaluable tips to survive wilderness and hostile Spirits.": "在许多周期中，精神家族创造了巨大的王国，并直接统治人们，有时是仁慈的，但更多的时候是以严酷和陌生的方式。这个时代的祖先往往比较害羞和谦逊，经常提供宝贵的技巧，让人们在荒野和敌对的灵体中生存。",
	"these current new cycles have seen a weakening of Spirit rule and a resurgence in the strength of the Fallen: will this be another Golden Era? Or will things get worse? According to some oracles, these Cycles will bring some novelties that have never been witnessed before. 7th Era Ancestors died relatively recently and can often provide fresh and helpful information.": "目前的这些新周期已经看到了精神统治的削弱和堕落者力量的回升：这将是另一个黄金时代吗？还是事情会变得更糟？根据一些神谕，这些周期将带来一些从未见过的新奇事物。第七纪元的祖先死得比较晚，往往能提供新鲜和有用的信息。",

	"I recommend discussing with the team if they are on board with having such themes in the game. If so, I still recommend using them sparingly–it can be cathartic to free an isolated village of slaves but it can get depressing to play a campaign in which most of Wagadu is in chains. Lore-wise slavery is currently rare in Wagadu, and was mostly practiced by Spirits in the 6th era (and, according to some legends, in the first two eras as well), Wagadu's Spirits' slavery is closer to pre-colonial African serfdom/ slavery than to American chattel-slavery: most of Wagadu's slaves have some rights and some can even become rispected and wealthy community leaders (though always under the ownership of some Spirit). The spirits that enslave people justify this an \"orderly way\" to manage the \"intrusion\" of the Fallen in Wagadu and \"offer protection\" to the enslaved against some (often manufactured) threat.": "我建议与团队讨论他们是否同意在游戏中使用这些主题。如果是这样的话，我还是建议少用这些主题--解放一个孤立的奴隶村可能是一种宣泄，但如果玩一个大部分瓦加杜人都被锁住的游戏，就会变得很压抑。从传说上看，奴隶制目前在瓦加杜很少见，在第六纪元主要是由神灵实行的（根据一些传说，在前两个纪元也是如此），瓦加杜的神灵的奴隶制更接近于殖民前的非洲农奴制/奴隶制，而不是美国的动产奴隶制：瓦加杜的大多数奴隶都有一些权利，有些甚至可以成为受人尊敬和富有的社区领袖（尽管总是在某个神灵的掌控之下）。奴役人们的神灵认为这是一种 \"有序的方式\"，以管理堕落者对瓦加杜的 \"入侵\"，并为被奴役者提供 \"保护\"，使其免受某种（通常是制造的）威胁。",
	"If you decide with the party to run a game in the 4th era instead then you might encounter many cycles that have \"conservative\" views on gender roles and sexuality: drums can be beaten only by men, only women carry things on their head, non-procreative sex might be frowned upon. Such type of close-mindedness might not be only patriarcal but could be matriarcal or even queer, such as in a society where heterosexual couples are entirely banned and the majority cannot express their affections freely.": "如果你决定在第四纪元运行一个游戏，那么你可能会遇到许多对性别角色和性行为有 \"保守 \"看法的周期：鼓只能由男人来敲，只有女人才能把东西放在头上，非创造性的性行为可能会被反对。这种封闭的观点可能不仅仅是父权制的，也可能是母权制的，甚至是同性恋的，比如在一个社会中，异性恋夫妇被完全禁止，大多数人不能自由表达他们的感情。",
	"In most cycles of the following eras, such rules are largely forgotten and communities who uphold them would usually do that because of the influence of some very old but active ancestors from the 4th era (who could turn into an interesting villain for the players). Wagadu is an open-minded and diverse place and with forethought, these exceptions can enhance and highlight it, rather than undermine it.": "在接下来的大多数时代循环中，这样的规则基本上被遗忘了，而坚持这些规则的社区通常会因为第四时代的一些非常古老但活跃的祖先的影响而这样做（他们可以变成玩家的一个有趣的反派）。瓦加杜是一个思想开放和多样化的地方，如果有先见之明，这些例外情况可以增强和突出它，而不是破坏它。",
	"In Wagadu you can play as a character from all traditional classes but a bit of context is needed to adapt them to this setting. Keep in mind that many people (and therefore PCs) identify more with their societal \"role\" (view some examples in each Lineage's chapter) than with their class.": "在瓦加杜，你可以扮演所有传统阶级的角色，但要使他们适应这个环境，还需要一点背景。请记住，许多人（因此也包括NPC）更认同他们的社会 \"角色\"（在每个世系的章节中查看一些例子）而不是他们的阶级。",
	"Barbarians in Wagadu are fighters who channel their connection with Spirits in order to be stronger in battle. When they \"rage\" a possession by some strong Spirit-Animal is what powers their strength. Some Spiritual Warriors have a specific spirit they worship and that possesses them while others \"open themselves\" to any spirits in the surroundings which want to help. In societies where spirits are strongly worshipped, barbarians can end up having important ceremonial and governmental roles. More god-focused societies tend to marginalise them, especially if Spirit worship is seen as secondary and folkish.": "瓦加杜的野蛮人是战士，他们通过引导与精神的联系，以便在战斗中变得更加强大。当他们 \"暴怒 \"时，一些强大的灵兽附体是他们力量的源泉。一些精神战士有自己崇拜的特定精神，并附身于他们，而另一些人则对周围想要帮助的任何精神 \"敞开自己\"。在强烈崇拜神灵的社会里，野蛮人最终会在仪式和政府中扮演重要角色。而更多以神为中心的社会则倾向于将他们边缘化，尤其是当神灵崇拜被视为次要和民间的时候。",
	"Spiritual Warriors can be often recognised by the many fetishes and charms they carry on themselves.": "精神战士通常可以通过他们身上的许多癖好和魅力来识别。",
	"Griots in Wagadu are very important figures. Bards don't just play music for the powerful and the crowds alike but they are repository of the knowledge. Thanks to their ancestral magic they can speak with Black (and sometimes Red) Ancestors and learn the histories and secrets of Wagadu. Griot tend to be respected throughout societies though sometimes their vast knowledge can make them feared as well (some legends tell about 4th Era Cycles where Griots got banished from most of the Islands by fearful rulers). Griots can be recognised by their musical instruments–they usually have an iconic one they carry everywhere.": "瓦加杜的格里特人是非常重要的人物。吟游诗人不只是为有权势的人和群众演奏音乐，他们还是知识的储存者。由于他们的祖先魔法，他们可以与黑人（有时是红人）祖先对话，并了解瓦加杜的历史和秘密。格里特人在整个社会中受到尊重，尽管有时他们丰富的知识也会使他们感到害怕（有些传说中，第四纪元的周期中，格里特人被恐惧的统治者从大部分岛屿上放逐）。格里奥特人可以通过他们的乐器来识别--他们通常有一个标志性的乐器，到处携带。",
	"Wagadu has plenty of Gods and they require worshippers to be appeased. In return they offer blessing to mortals, especially those who officiate their rituals. Within very pious cultures such as typically Asiman or Emere ones, priesthoods are very important and sometimes even govern communities. Cultures more focused on Spirit or Ancestor worship such as Swala or Ironmaster ones attach less importance to their role.": "瓦加杜有很多神灵，他们需要崇拜者的安抚。作为回报，他们向凡人提供祝福，特别是那些主持他们仪式的人。在非常虔诚的文化中，如典型的阿西曼或埃米尔文化，祭司是非常重要的，有时甚至可以管理社区。更注重精神或祖先崇拜的文化，如斯瓦拉或铁匠的文化，对他们的作用不太重视。",
	"Wagadu's priests can be often recognised by a staff related to their deity.": "瓦加杜的祭司通常可以通过与他们的神灵有关的杖来识别。",
	"Witch-doctors are to Spirits what clerics are to Gods, they worship them, officiate Spirit appeasing rights and in exchange obtain powers. Witch-Doctors' relationship with Spirits can be very varied, transactional, friendly or even conflictual, depending on the type of entity. Their magic relies more on nature and their surroundings rather than distant powers. In godly societies such as the Asiman's they are at the fringes of society whereas in more Spirit friendly societies such as the Lionblood they are very much at the center.": "巫医对神灵的作用就像教士对神灵的作用一样，他们崇拜神灵，主持神灵的安抚仪式，并以此为交换获得力量。巫医与神灵的关系可以是非常多样的，交易性的、友好的甚至是冲突性的，这取决于实体的类型。他们的魔法更多依赖于自然和周围环境，而不是遥远的力量。在阿西曼人这样的神性社会中，他们处于社会的边缘，而在狮血人这样对神灵更友好的社会中，他们则处于中心地位。",

	"Usually a fighter can be recognised by their practical equipment and their protective fetish-charms.": "通常情况下，战士可以通过他们的实用设备和保护性癖好的武器来识别。",
	"It is said that an ancient Ironmaster became the first Ancestral Wrestler by discovering their \"Nyama\", a source of energy that resides in everyone and that originates from one's connection with their ancestors. According to monks even Lineage traits are just manifestations of Nyama.": "据说，一位古老的铁师通过发现自己的 \"Nyama \"而成为第一位祖传摔跤手，这种能量的源泉存在于每个人的体内，它源于一个人与祖先的联系。根据僧侣们的说法，即使是血统特征也只是Nyama的表现形式。",
	"From this first monk, several orders of Ancestral Wrestlers were born, some long-lost, others thriving. Different orders can vary a lot but they all agree on strengthening their Nyama in order to better connect with their ancestors. Both mental and physical training feature prominently.": "从这第一个和尚开始，诞生了好几个祖先摔跤手的团体，有的早已失传，有的正蓬勃发展。不同的僧团可能有很大的不同，但他们都同意加强他们的Nyama，以便更好地与他们的祖先联系。精神和身体的训练都是很重要的。",

	"While priests are the official representatives of deities in Wagadu, Shrine Warriors are the guardians that make sure that nothing disrupts this. They typically devote themselves to a specific deity or cult and protect it no matter what. When they leave their temple or shrine is to go on some divine mission. They strive to keep up the ideals and philosophies of that specific belief in order to be a shining example of faith. The gods bless them with some powers similar to those of priests.": "祭司是瓦加杜神祗的官方代表，而神殿武士则是确保没有任何东西会破坏这一点的守护者。他们通常将自己奉献给一个特定的神灵或邪教，无论如何都要保护它。当他们离开他们的寺庙或神殿时，就是去执行一些神圣的任务。他们努力保持该特定信仰的理想和哲学，以成为信仰的光辉榜样。神明保佑他们拥有一些类似于祭司的权力。",

	"Rogues in Wagadu might specialise in many different things to thrive. Some are expert thieves within communities though this is a very risky path due to the many protective spells and curses that can be found in these lands. More frequently Wagadu's rogues focus on infiltrating and robbing the supernatural creatures that threaten or coexist with people. Some wonder the seas becoming renown pirates.": "瓦加杜的流氓可能会专门从事许多不同的事情来发展。有些人是社区内的盗贼专家，但由于这些土地上有许多保护性的咒语和诅咒，所以这是一条非常危险的道路。更多时候，瓦加杜的流氓专注于潜入和抢劫威胁或与人共存的超自然生物。有些人在海上航行，成为著名的海盗。",
	"Wagadian rogues can come in all forms and shapes but they tend to wear comfortable clothes, easy to carry weapons and sometimes conceal their face with masks or cloths.": "瓦加德流氓可以有各种形式和形状，但他们往往穿着舒适的衣服，易于携带的武器，有时用面具或布条来掩盖他们的脸。",

	"Often they wear disheveled clothes and carry scary looking charms.": "他们往往穿着凌乱的衣服，带着看起来很可怕的符咒。",
	"Just like priests, warlocks obtain their powers from powerful supernatural entities but rather than these being gods and having to follow their tenets, warlocks pick other entities, such as powerful Spirits or Ancestors and keep the exchange at a pure transactional level: the entity provides magic and the warlock provides something material or spiritual in exchange.": "就像牧师一样，术士从强大的超自然实体那里获得他们的力量，但这些实体不是神，也不需要遵循他们的信条，术士会选择其他实体，比如强大的神灵或祖先，并将交换保持在纯粹的交易层面：实体提供魔法，术士提供一些物质或精神的交换。",
	"They always carry some mark that symbolises their pact with their supernatural patron such as a large tribal mark, an eye turned white or a visible scar.": "他们总是带着一些标志，象征着他们与超自然守护者的契约，如一个大的部落标志、一只变白的眼睛或一个明显的疤痕。",
	"Wizards of Wagadu trace their magic to two main traditions, the Asiman \"Sukunya\" alchemists and the Emere \"Alawo\" magicians. Whereas the Sukunya always had to share knowledge and power with their priests co-rulers, the Emere wizards unhinged power made them so powerful that Alawo is now a byword for wizard.": "瓦加杜的魔法师可以追溯到两个主要的传统，阿西曼的 \"苏昆亚 \"炼金术士和埃米尔的 \"阿拉沃 \"魔法师。苏昆亚人总是不得不与他们的牧师共同统治者分享知识和权力，而埃米尔巫师不正常的力量使他们如此强大，以至于Alawo现在是一个巫师的代名词。",
	"Wagadian wizards tend to record their spells with little inscriptions on their Opon Ifa boards, which they use to cast spells by tossing and shaking cowries upon. Sukunya tradition wizards typically record their spells in thick books. An increasing number of Alawo uses both.": "瓦加迪的巫师们倾向于在他们的Opon Ifa板上用小铭文记录他们的咒语，他们用这些铭文在上面抛掷和摇动牛肝菌来施法。苏昆亚传统巫师通常在厚厚的书中记录他们的咒语。越来越多的Alawo人同时使用这两种方法。",

	"Experience points in Wagadu are tangible things and are called \"memories\". Doing actions of all sorts, and especially those high stakes ones such as fighting for your life, trigger people to regain lost memories. Character progression in Wagadu is a mix of traditional advancement and recovery of Upper World memories. At its bare minimum memories can be left as a background element but for the more enterprising DM and players they can become a way to build the characters backstory and forward the plot (e.g. a character levelling up suddenly remembers that their benefactor and commissioner was the evil warlock that exterminated her village in the Upper Worlds... Are these missions a trap? Does the warlock even remember their past? What should the players do?": "瓦加杜的经验值是有形的东西，被称为 \"记忆\"。做各种各样的行动，尤其是那些高风险的行动，比如为自己的生命而战，会触发人们恢复失去的记忆。在Wagadu中，角色的发展是一个传统的进步和恢复上层世界记忆的组合。在最低限度上，记忆可以作为一个背景元素，但对于更有魄力的DM和玩家来说，它们可以成为建立角色背景故事和推进情节的一种方式（例如，一个角色在升级时突然想起他们的恩人和专员是在上层世界灭绝她的村庄的邪恶术士。这些任务是一个陷阱吗？术士甚至记得他们的过去吗？玩家应该怎么做？",

Fetish-Armors do not count as attuned items but they are deactivated by anti-magic effects.": "由于符咒需要一些时间来适应你的身体，所以它的激活时间与穿戴相关盔甲的时间相同。无论符咒盔甲的威力有多大，脱下都是一个动作。魅惑盔甲不算作调和物品，但它们会被反魔法效果所停用。",
	"Metal armors, especially chainmails, do exist but are very rare and tend to be magical (with magic to decrease their temperature).": "金属盔甲，尤其是链甲，确实存在，但非常罕见，而且往往是魔法的（用魔法降低其温度）。",
	"The people of Wagadu have had to master a wide range of weapons to defend themselves from the countless dangers of their land. Most of Wagadu's weapon designs are very ancient and tend to be tightly connected to the old Star cultures of a specific Lineage.": "瓦加杜人不得不掌握各种各样的武器，以抵御他们土地上的无数危险。瓦加杜的大多数武器设计都非常古老，并倾向于与特定血统的古老星际文化紧密相连。",
	"Below is a very small selection of weapons and their corresponding rule-set reference.": "下面是一个非常小的武器选择和它们相应的规则集参考。",
	"Weapons in Wagadu are more than tools, and not just for Lionbloods steeped in Mweya spirituality or Ironmaster Smiths but even defenseless farmers carry them sometimes as they are often charms and symbols and can even influence supernatural entities, especially Ancestors. As a DM you are encouraged to build some lore and interactions around Wagadu's weapons, such as using it for rituals or having it provide advantage for a specific Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check with an Ancestor.": "在瓦加杜，武器不仅仅是工具，而且不仅仅是沉浸在Mweya精神信仰中的狮人或铁匠，即使是毫无防备的农民有时也会携带武器，因为它们往往是符咒和象征，甚至可以影响超自然的实体，尤其是祖先们。作为DM，我们鼓励你围绕瓦加杜的武器建立一些传说和互动，比如把它用于仪式，或者让它为与祖先的特定魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查提供优势。",
	"The standard currencies of Wagadu are:": "瓦加杜的标准货币是。",
	"As in every society, there are some tensions in Wagadian societies and these are some of the most typical ones:": "和每个社会一样，瓦加迪社会也有一些紧张关系，这些是最典型的一些。",
	"Most Ancestors in Wagadu tend to draw people towards ancient traditions that they were part of but this might not always sit well with the people they try to influence–additionally spirits of different cultural traditions might be tugging into different directions, adding to the tension. This is most visible when Ancestors from the 4th era get involved since their mores can be very strict and divergent.": "大多数瓦加杜的祖先倾向于把人们引向他们曾经参与的古老传统，但这可能并不总是与他们试图影响的人相处融洽--此外，不同文化传统的精神可能被扯向不同的方向，增加了紧张。当第四纪元的祖先参与进来时，这种情况最为明显，因为他们的风俗习惯可能非常严格和不同。",
	"Most people in Wagadu are very religious, the gods' influences and power are tangible. All cultures have different views on which the main gods are and how they affect the world. Typically most Wagadu societies are good at blending different creeds by creatic new syncretic pantheons but sometimes a \"crusade\" of one specific brand of religiosity might appear in a specific era, especially if that is happening in the Upper Realms as well and some Fallen have been indoctrinated. Powerful spirits too have been known to use their worshippers to fight each other.": "瓦加杜的大多数人都非常虔诚，神灵的影响和力量是实实在在的。所有的文化都对主要的神灵有不同的看法，以及他们如何影响世界。通常情况下，大多数瓦加杜社会善于通过创造新的同步神殿来融合不同的信条，但有时一个特定的宗教品牌的 \"十字军 \"可能会出现在一个特定的时代，特别是如果这也发生在上层世界和一些堕落者被灌输了。强大的神灵也曾被称为利用他们的崇拜者来对抗对方。",
	"The concept of \"civilised\" and \"uncivilised\" people can sometimes come up in cultural differences but it's actually very rare. Most people are aware that a seemingly detached and simple culture deep in the rainforest, might have ancestral secrets and a powerful Totem Spirit that would put a metropolis to shame. Such term and hierarchy is usually referred to people who break taboos such as killing many animals and disrespecting Ancestors and Spirits. Such people live on the fringes of societies but sometimes created their own (usually fragile) structures.": "在文化差异中有时会出现 \"文明 \"和 \"不文明 \"的概念，但实际上这非常罕见。大多数人都知道，在雨林深处的一个看似超脱和简单的文化，可能有祖先的秘密和强大的图腾精神，会让一个大都市感到羞愧。这种说法和等级制度通常是指那些打破禁忌的人，如杀死许多动物和不尊重祖先和神灵。这种人生活在社会的边缘，但有时也创造了自己的（通常是脆弱的）结构。",
	"D&D's typical alignment rules help role-playing but can often hinder nuance too. For Wagadu I recommend being very flexible with alignments. NPCs like Spirits and Ancestors can shift wildly between different alignment based on context and how they are treated. Be prepared to change a LG Ancestor into a CE if the village commits a grave disrespect and she goes from Black to Red Ancestor.": "D&D的典型排列规则有助于角色扮演，但往往也会阻碍细微差别。对于Wagadu来说，我建议在排列组合上要非常灵活。像神灵和祖先这样的NPC可以根据环境和对待他们的方式，在不同的排列组合之间发生巨大的变化。如果村子里的人犯了严重的不敬行为，而她从黑祖宗变成了红祖宗，那么就要准备把LG祖宗变成CE。",
	"The concept of family changes a lot when people fall. Apart from rare occasions, Fallen lose their biological families and this forces them to strongly rely on their newfound fellow Fallen. This means that often people create new families and it's not uncommon for many Wagadians to change or add a surname to symbolise the new bond. Wagadians often speak about \"Fall Siblings\"–these are people who fell at the same time and location and with whom they have an almost mystical affinity. Such bonds are set to last sometimes for the rest of the Fallen's life.": "当人们堕落时，家庭的概念发生了很大的变化。除了极少数情况外，堕落者会失去他们的亲生家庭，这迫使他们强烈地依赖他们新发现的堕落者同伴。这意味着人们经常会建立新的家庭，许多瓦加迪人改变或增加一个姓氏以象征新的联系，这并不罕见。瓦加迪人经常谈论 \"堕落兄弟姐妹\"--这些人在同一时间和地点堕落，他们与这些人有一种近乎神秘的亲和力。这种联系有时会持续到堕落者的余生。",
	"The main reason why Wagadu's history is divided in Cycles of Falls and extinction is because Wagadians cannot continue their bloodlines by having children. People can have children but the results are different from what they would be in the Upper Realms (where children are normal). Wagadu's children are called Spirit Children because they immediately show signs of not belonging to the mortal world:": "瓦加杜的历史之所以被划分为瀑布和灭绝的周期，主要是因为瓦加杜人不能通过生孩子来延续他们的血统。人们可以生孩子，但结果与在上层世界的情况不同（在那里孩子是正常的）。瓦加杜的孩子被称为精神之子，因为他们立即表现出不属于凡人世界的迹象。",
	"They grow at extraordinary speed": "它们以非凡的速度生长",
	"They tend to behave in somewhat alien ways such as spending hours staring at the forest, or whispering in languages that no one around them speaks": "他们的行为往往有些异类，如花时间盯着森林，或用周围人不懂的语言低声说话。",
	"They usually appear physically different, sometimes it's subtle such as a lighter skin tone, others it's very clear, such as glowing eyes or four arms.": "他们通常会出现身体上的不同，有时是微妙的，如较浅的肤色，其他则是非常明显的，如发光的眼睛或四条手臂。",
	"Most Spirit Children quickly grow into teenagers and then disappear into the wilderness, breaking their parents heart (though stories abound of Spirit Children mysteriously visiting once a while or leaving bizarre gifts for their parents, many years after their departure).": "大多数灵童迅速成长为青少年，然后消失在荒野中，使他们的父母伤心欲绝（尽管灵童在离开多年后还会神秘地拜访一次，或给他们的父母留下离奇的礼物，这种故事比比皆是）。",
	"Additionally there is an even darker side to the story. Some children, rather than simply walking away from their village, turn into Dwens. Dwens are faceless children with immense destructive powers that seem to be animated by a desire to torment their parents and their community. Wagadu's Ancestors tell uncountable tales of villages ravaged by Dwens.": "此外，这个故事还有一个更黑暗的一面。一些孩子不是简单地离开他们的村庄，而是变成了Dwens。Dwens是不露面的孩子，具有巨大的破坏力，似乎被折磨他们的父母和社区的愿望所驱使。瓦加杜的祖先讲述了数不清的村庄被德文斯蹂躏的故事。",
	"For these reasons, many communities are weary of Spirit Children although few outright ban them.": "由于这些原因，许多社区对 \"灵童 \"感到厌倦，尽管很少有社区直接禁止他们。",
	"Wagadian cultures used to have a dizzying amount of calendars but in the latest Eras the most used one are a 12 months calendar and 7 day week.": "瓦加迪文化曾经有大量的日历，但在最近的时代，最常用的是12个月的日历和7天的星期。",
	"Many priests still use an ancient 4 day \"Ogero\" calendar for religious purposes that is said to have been initiated in an ancient Upper Realm city of Ogero which was ruled by conjoined Elementalist (Asiman Gods) and Emere clergies.": "许多牧师仍然使用古老的4天 \"Ogero \"日历进行宗教活动，据说是在一个古老的上界城市Ogero启动的，该城市由连在一起的元素主义者（Asiman神）和Emere神职人员统治。",
	"Most of Wagadu follows the flow of two seasons, a rain season which is usually in the middle of the year, and a dry season which bridges to the following year.": "瓦加杜的大部分地区遵循两个季节的流动，雨季通常在年中，而旱季则衔接到第二年。",
	"The many cultures of Wagadu have several festivities that may or may not overlap, as an old saying goes \"The festive drum is always beating in some hut.\"": "瓦加杜的许多文化都有几个节日，这些节日可能重叠，也可能不重叠，正如一句老话所说：\"节日的鼓声总是在某个小屋里敲响\"。",
	"Compared to most real-world societies, attitudes to nudity are much more relaxed in Wagadu.": "与大多数现实世界的社会相比，瓦加杜对裸体的态度要宽松得多。",
	"With their weather being under-dressed is often comfortable (though not under the scorching sun of the desert). Men and women's chests are not considered any different and uncovering breasts is not seen as shameful. On a daily basis people usually cover their genitals with full nudity usually being related to specific rituals.": "在他们的天气下，穿得少往往很舒服（虽然在沙漠的烈日下不舒服）。男人和女人的胸部不被认为有什么不同，揭开乳房也不被认为是可耻的。在日常工作中，人们通常会遮盖自己的生殖器，全裸通常与特定的仪式有关。",
	"Most people in Wagadu identify with three genders, {@b Female}, {@b Male} and {@b Ancestral}.": "瓦加杜的大多数人都认同三种性别，即（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。",
	"{@b Ancestral Gender} is named after the Ancestors' appearance: many of them present combined traits from the other two genders (such as breast, beard and penis) since Ancestors (and some Spirits and Gods) are seen as above such distinctions. Depending on cultures and personal identifications, there are many terms for third genders in Wagadu—Ancestral Gender is just the most common umbrella one.": "{@b Ancestral Gender}是根据祖先的外表命名的：他们中的许多人都呈现出其他两种性别的综合特征（如乳房、胡须和阴茎），因为祖先（以及一些精神和神灵）被视为高于这种区别。根据文化和个人认同的不同，在瓦加杜有许多关于第三性别的术语--祖先的性别只是最常见的总括性术语。",
	"Throughout Wagadu's history, there haven't been specific predominant sexual mores (such as heteronormativity) but some specific subcultures, especially during the 4th Era, did impose stricter rules. Such mores are seen as regressive and bizarre by most people (view  {@book Slavery & Patriarchy box|WagaduChronicles|1|Slavery and Patriarchy in Wagadu}). A well known Wagadu saying goes {@note (sic)}.": "纵观瓦加杜的历史，并没有特定的主导性道德规范（如异性恋），但一些特定的亚文化，特别是在第四纪元期间，确实施加了更严格的规则。这种风俗被大多数人看作是倒退和怪异的（查看（%0%））。一句广为人知的瓦格多谚语说（%1%）。",
	"The sexuality of Wagadu is not just influenced by modern human rights views, as for most fantasy settings, but also by pre-colonial African mores as well. Even if patriarchy was present throughout the Continent, a lot of other sexualities existed, often celebrated, integrated and very visible. European colonisation mostly put an end to this. There is a good amount of information out there, one good source I recommend is {@i \"Boy-Wives and Female Husbands–Studies in African Homosexualities\"} by {@b Stephen O. Murray} and {@b Will Roscoe}.": "瓦加杜的性行为不仅受到现代人权观点的影响，就像大多数幻想背景一样，而且也受到殖民前非洲风俗的影响。即使父权制存在于整个非洲大陆，也有很多其他的性行为存在，往往是被赞美的、融合的、非常明显的。欧洲的殖民化大多结束了这一点。外面有大量的信息，我推荐的一个好资料是{@b Stephen O. Murray}和{@b Will Roscoe}的{@i \"Boy-Wives and Female Husbands–Studies in African Homosexualities\"}。",
	"A peculiar and unexplained thing that happens in Wagadu is that when people with disabilities fall, they gain some special powers, related to whichever disability they had in the Upper Realms.": "在瓦加杜发生的一件奇特的、无法解释的事情是，当残疾人堕落时，他们会获得一些特殊的力量，与他们在上层世界的哪种残疾有关。",
	"Blind people gain 60ft {@sense tremorsense|MM}.": "盲人获得60英尺（%0%）。",
	"Deaf people gain advantage on all Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that involve sight.": "聋人在所有涉及视觉的智慧（（%0%））检查中获得优势。",
	"Mute people gain telepathy up to 60ft (affected by language comprehension).": "哑巴获得心灵感应，最远可达60英尺（受语言理解力影响）。",
	"People with walking disabilities are able to hover a few feet off the ground (moving at speed similar to other players–falling great heights affects them as everyone else).": "有行走障碍的人能够在离地几英尺的地方盘旋（移动速度与其他玩家相似--从高处跌落对他们的影响与其他人一样）。",
	"Players and DMs are encouraged to come up and discuss interesting solutions, keeping in mind that in Wagadu, disabled people might be rule-wise more powerful than other characters.": "我们鼓励玩家和管理员提出并讨论有趣的解决方案，同时牢记在Wagadu中，残疾人可能在规则上比其他角色更强大。",
	"Wagadu's lineages are not races: all Fallen are humans. In the Upper Realms and Wagadu ancestral and spiritual influences are so powerful that they end up affecting people's appearances and supernatural powers. This is what a lineage is, a physical manifestation of an ancestral and spiritual influence on you.": "瓦加杜的血统不是种族：所有堕落者都是人类。在上层世界和瓦加杜，祖先和精神的影响是如此强大，以至于最终影响了人们的外表和超自然的力量。这就是血统，是祖先和精神对你影响的物理表现。",
	"For most individuals, lineages are typically \"inherited\" from one parent but that is not always the case, some children spontaneously manifest a lineage from a grandparents or from seemingly \"nowhere\" (Wagadu's scholars argue that if you dig deep, everyone is ultimately related to everyone, so every Fallen has ancestry in all lineages). Most babies are born with a visible lineage but a few are born \"latent\" with no discernable traits till they grow older (these late bloomers usually manifest a lineage by when they are teenagers). Some people switch between lineages during their life as well, realising they identify more with a different lineage than their family's. Most of the time such change is influenced by other members of that lineage but it can sometimes happen even without any contact with their new lineage. In such rare cases it's the attunement with a specific aspect of their existence that helps transform them (e.g. an isolated seafaring Ironblood that eventually turns Ikaki).": "对于大多数人来说，血统通常是从父母一方 \"继承 \"的，但这并不总是如此，有些孩子会自发地表现出来自祖父母的血统，或者似乎 \"不知从何而来\"（瓦加杜的学者认为，如果你深入挖掘，每个人最终都与每个人有关，所以每个堕落者都有所有血统的祖先）。大多数婴儿出生时都有明显的血统，但也有少数人出生时是 \"潜伏 \"的，直到他们长大后才有明显的特征（这些晚熟的人通常在十几岁时就表现出血统）。有些人在一生中也会在不同的血统之间转换，意识到他们更认同不同的血统，而不是他们的家族。大多数情况下，这种变化是受到该血统其他成员的影响，但有时甚至在没有与新血统接触的情况下也会发生。在这种罕见的情况下，是与他们生存的特定方面相适应，帮助他们转变（例如，一个孤立的航海铁血人最终变成了伊卡基）。",
	"Belonging to a lineage does not simply affect your looks; the new ways Ancestors and spirits behave with you and the changes to your body have such an impact that two members of the same lineage, even if from very different cultures, will always have something in common. The lonely Emere that was born out of an entirely Swala village will still have the same basic understanding of magic (\"Juju Knowledge\") that a magic trained Emere from the distant rainforest city has, thanks to mystical dreams and visits from Emere Ancestors–even if she still identify as culturally part of the Rain Clouds, the dominant Swala culture of those grasslands, and loves taking out her cattle for pasture in between her magical studies.": "属于一个血统并不简单地影响你的长相；祖先和精神与你相处的新方式以及你身体的变化有这样的影响，同一血统的两个成员，即使来自非常不同的文化，也总是有一些共同点。出生在一个完全由斯瓦拉人组成的村庄的孤独的埃米尔，仍然会有与来自遥远的雨林城市的受过魔法训练的埃米尔一样的对魔法的基本理解（\"Juju Knowledge\"），这要感谢神秘的梦和埃米尔祖先的拜访--即使她在文化上仍然认同雨云的一部分，即那些草原的主流斯瓦拉文化，并喜欢在她的魔法学习之间把她的牛群赶出去放牧。",
	"Cultures are the behaviours and customs that are shared between a particular society and there is a complex and nuanced relationship between cultures and lineages–to some extent in the Upper Realms where people are born and even more in Wagadu.": "文化是一个特定社会之间共享的行为和习俗，文化和血统之间存在着复杂而微妙的关系--在一定程度上，在人们出生的上层世界，甚至在瓦加杜更多。",
	"Throughout the history of the Upper Realms, people have had a tendency to gather with members of their own lineage and this has created some cultural elements that are associated with a lineage.": "纵观上层世界的历史，人们倾向于与自己的血统成员聚集在一起，这也创造了一些与血统相关的文化元素。",
	"Ancestors of all lineages play a fundamental role in the maintenance of distinct cultures (and sometimes the creation of new ones) with their competing influences on people. Whereas in the Upper Realms, the community of birth is often the primary factor that leads to someone identifying with a culture, the massive social disruption and partial memory loss that comes with the Fall into Wagadu, leads to a more fluid and unpredictable cultural landscape where Ancestors play an even more important role.": "所有血统的祖先在维持独特的文化（有时也创造新的文化）方面发挥着基本作用，他们对人们的影响是相互竞争的。在上层世界，出生的社区往往是导致人们认同一种文化的主要因素，而堕入瓦加杜后，大规模的社会混乱和部分记忆的丧失，导致了一个更加流动和不可预测的文化景观，祖先在其中发挥了更重要的作用。",
	"Though not entirely irrelevant, lineage is a somewhat unreliable indicator of a person's culture in Wagadu compared to other elements such as clothing, specific vocabulary (e.g. ritual greetings) and overall spirituality.": "虽然并非完全不相关，但与服装、特定词汇（如仪式上的问候语）和整体精神面貌等其他要素相比，世系在瓦加杜是一个有点不可靠的指标。",
	"Cultures are not related to a specific geographical place. Thanks to the Ancestors' influence throughout Wagadu's eras and the political upheavals of the Upper Realms, cultures can spread and shrink in all sorts of ways, just as religions. Cultures can sometimes come into conflict as well as they have different views of how to deal with people, nature and spirituality.": "文化与特定的地理位置没有关系。由于祖先在整个瓦加杜时代的影响和上层世界的政治动荡，文化可以以各种方式传播和萎缩，就像宗教一样。文化有时也会发生冲突，因为它们对如何处理人、自然和精神的关系有不同的看法。",
	"Upper Realms scholars have come up with categories to describe different cultures in relation to lineages and nowadays most members of such cultures idefinity with such terms.": "上层世界的学者们提出了一些分类，以描述与世系有关的不同文化，如今，这些文化的大多数成员都认同这些术语。",
	"A lineage is a very deep and entrenched part of a person's identity and changing it is not something one does lightly. Several rituals exist for such transition and they are known to be disorienting and even painful. They typically consist in a form of communion with Ancestors of the new lineage and have been sometimes described like \"shedding a snake skin\". Very few individuals go through the process more than once in their lives.": "血统是一个人身份中非常深刻和根深蒂固的部分，改变血统并不是一件轻而易举的事情。对于这种转变，存在一些仪式，而且众所周知，这些仪式会使人迷失方向，甚至是痛苦的。它们通常包括与新血统的祖先进行交流的形式，有时被描述为 \"脱掉蛇皮\"。很少有人一生中会经历一次以上的过程。",
	"So called because they are the result of the gathering of many people of the same lineage, just like the many stars of a cloudless and moonless night. Consequently these cultures are strongly associated with one specific lineage.": "之所以这样说，是因为它们是同一血统的许多人聚集在一起的结果，就像无云无月的夜晚的许多星星。因此，这些文化与一个特定的血统密切相关。",
	"Feenan is a young Daa'ima that grew up in a New Moon Daa'ima only village in a hidden valley. She fervently worships Addeessa and devoutly follows the death-related traditions of her village. Ayaanas (Daa'ima Ancestors) from very old eras often appear in the village and teach ancient rituals and lore to the villages.": "费南是一个年轻的达伊玛人，在一个隐藏的山谷中只有新月达伊玛人的村庄里长大。她狂热地崇拜阿德萨，并虔诚地遵循她村子里与死亡有关的传统。来自非常古老时代的Ayaanas（Daa'ima祖先）经常出现在村子里，向村子里的人传授古老的仪式和传说。",
	"Star cultures are cultures where the knowledge and traditions of the ancestral members of one specific lineage dominate and usually such communities have a clear majority of people who belong, either by birth or by choice, to that dominant lineage. Nevertheless being born in or even transitioning into another lineage, does not usually affect inclusion in that culture (least the person actively wanting that).": "星形文化是指某一特定血统的祖先成员的知识和传统占主导地位的文化，通常这种社区有明显的大多数人，无论是出生还是选择，都属于该主导血统。然而，出生在另一个世系，甚至过渡到另一个世系，通常不影响融入该文化（至少是主动想融入的人）。",
	"Feenan's twin brother Labuu, who had been mesmerised with fire throughout his childhood, has surprised the village by turning into a Fire Asiman in his teens: as long as he sticks to the traditions, such as Moon worship and monthly \"Death Dances\" he'll still be part of that Daa'ima \"Shrouded\" culture of the village.": "费南的孪生兄弟拉布（Labuu）在整个童年时期都被火迷住了，他在十几岁时变成了火阿西曼人，这让村子里的人感到惊讶：只要他坚持传统，比如月亮崇拜和每月的 \"死亡之舞\"，他就仍然是村子里那种Daa'ima \"裹尸布 \"文化的一部分。",
	"However if Feenan were to start listening more carefully to the whisper of the Asiman Ancestors that have been visiting his dreams lately, he might join an Asiman Star or Sun & Moon (view next section) culture—that would is his choice to make.": "然而，如果费南开始更仔细地倾听阿西曼祖先的低语，最近一直在访问他的梦境，他可能会加入阿西曼星或日月（查看下一节）文化--那将是他的选择。",

	"The languages people speak in Wagadu are based on where in the Upper Realms they come from. There are several \"common\" languages there and they do not correlate to lineages or cultures but just to geographic areas.

The other one is the Waning moon, those who, although born and bred in cities, decided to return to a more isolated life in mountain villages. These branches were crucial to Daa'ima society as they allowed New and Full moon cultures and economies to stay connected.

	"There is some reticence towards making Alawos Obas due to the perceived conflict between their magical and political power. Exceptions are made for extraordinary individuals but when the Oba is a Alawo they are not bestowed with primacy over the churches. An Ogboni Priest is elected as \"Divine Oba\" to cover that role. Divine Obas have at times become extremely influential leading to some Emere kingdoms having effectively two souverains: the Alawo Oba and the Divine Oba–or \"Twin Obas\".": "由于人们认为阿拉沃人与政治权力之间存在冲突，因此对任命阿拉沃人为奥巴有些犹豫不决。对于特殊的人来说，会有例外，但当奥巴是阿拉沃时，他们不会被赋予对教会的首要地位。一个奥格博尼牧师被选为 \"神圣的奥巴 \"来扮演这一角色。神圣的奥巴有时会变得非常有影响力，导致一些埃米尔王国实际上有两个统治者：阿拉沃-奥巴和神圣的奥巴--或 \"双奥巴\"。",

	"It is said that in very ancient times Ancestors were rarely seen and the Kra-Tete \"Ancient Gods\" (literally \"Ancient Souls\") looked over the early families of the Ironmasters. The Ancient Gods taught many things to the first Hyerenn, including goldsmithing, but then mysteriously disappeared, according to legend, deep into the earth. This is the reason why Ironmasters are so mindful when digging the soil and have ceremonies to accompany such activities.": "据说在非常古老的时代，人们很少见到祖先，Kra-Tete \"古神\"（字面意思是 \"古老的灵魂\"）看护着铁匠的早期家族。古老的神灵教给了第一批Hyerenn人许多东西，包括金匠，但后来却神秘地消失了，据说是在地球深处。这就是为什么铁匠们在挖土的时候非常注意，并且有仪式来配合这种活动的原因。",

	"When an Iron Soul dies, their soul usually becomes a weak, minor Ancestor that is very close to mortals and helps, often even getting into charms in order to make them more powerful.": "当铁魂死后，他们的灵魂通常会变成一个弱小的祖先，与凡人非常亲近，并提供帮助，甚至经常进入符咒，以使他们更加强大。",
	"After a while, according to some theologians, time and worship increases the chances, a minor Ancestor will either join the First Ones in their spiritual home or become part of the spiritual retinue of one of the Great Ancestors (view below).": "一段时间后，根据一些神学家的说法，时间和崇拜会增加机会，一个小祖先要么加入第一人的精神家园，要么成为某个大祖先的精神随从的一部分（见下文）。",
	"For people of other lineages, the Kesye Nsamanfo or Great Ancestors, are just the gods of the Ironmasters. Any Hyerenn that would hear this would quickly disagree. The Kesye Nsamanfo earned their status. They do indeed look and act very much like gods but they started as mortals. Their deeds were so great that when they died, they did not become minor Ancestors but something else and much more powerful.

The shrine dedicated to it will show that its wooden statue is plated with gold and occasionally even the river will have gold nuggets to be found. Additionally it will never do any harm to the village (lest being grossly angered).": "例如，如果一个Hyerenn社区想让居住在村子旁边的河神绿水平静下来，他们可以与她交谈，并试图说服她成为一位伟大祖先的仆人，如黄金之母。如果它不同意，他们可能要用打斗来制服它，但假设它接受了供品，那么这个精灵就会成为绿水，西卡-马梅的仆人。献给它的神龛会显示它的木制雕像镀上了金子，偶尔甚至在河里也会发现金块。此外，它不会对村庄造成任何伤害（以免被严重激怒）。",

	"Nalangu, touched by the vision and confident she had been blessed by this Eland spirit, left her beadcrown to her brother and went into the Savanna.": "纳兰古被这一景象所触动，相信自己得到了这个埃兰人精神的祝福，于是将珠冠留给了她的哥哥，并走进了萨瓦纳。",
	"Inspired by the dream, she tried to speak with as many grassland spirits as she could:": "在梦境的激励下，她试图与尽可能多的草原精灵对话。",
	"The spirits of grass themselves were so many and tiny that speaking with them was fruitless.": "草的精神本身是如此之多，如此之小，以至于与它们说话都没有结果。",
	"The big cats tried to hunt her down and she met lionbloods that did not help her.": "大猫们试图追捕她，她遇到的狮族人也没有帮助她。",
	"The acacia and baobab trees listened to her but were too slow to deliberate.": "金合欢树和猴面包树听着她的话，但却迟迟没有做出决定。",
	"Many of the other spirits asked too much and offered too little.": "其他许多精神要求太多，提供的太少。",
	"Just as Nalangu began to despair, a cow spirit offered to help and the queen realised that the most receptive spirits were cow, goat and other docile animals, who needed mortals to thrive and were happy to see her come to the grasslands.": "就在纳兰古开始绝望的时候，一个牛的灵魂提出了帮助，女王意识到最容易接受的灵魂是牛、山羊和其他温顺的动物，它们需要凡人来茁壮成长，并且很高兴看到她来到草原上。",
	"She did uncountable deals with these spirits, sealing bonds that would last for eras to come.": "她与这些神灵做了数不清的交易，封存了将持续数个时代的纽带。",
	"Followed by cattle, the queen returned to gather her people and to leave the forest for good.": "在牛群的跟随下，女王回来召集她的人民，并永远地离开了森林。",
	"Well provisioned, Nalangu's people marched into the middle of the savanna. They walked for days until they found a beautiful blue lake surrounded by giant Ironwood trees.": "纳兰古的族人得到了充足的供给，他们向大草原中部进军。他们走了好几天，直到发现一个美丽的蓝色湖泊，周围是巨大的铁树。",
	"There they all rested and quenched their thirst and even considered to make that peaceful corner a home for themselves. Unbeknownst to them, the Spirit of that lake had a rotten heart: it took the people's offerings but told them in an unintelligible spiritual language that it was not offering protection, deceiving them.": "他们都在那里休息，解渴，甚至考虑把那个宁静的角落作为自己的家。他们不知道，那湖的灵有一颗腐朽的心：它接受了人们的供品，却用一种无法理解的精神语言告诉他们，它并没有提供保护，欺骗了他们。",
	"During the night, it hovered like a mist over all the people and when they woke up, everybody was bound in iron chains.": "在夜里，它像雾一样盘旋在所有的人身上，当他们醒来时，每个人都被铁链捆绑着。",
	"Neither Nalagu nor her fighters and sorcerers could do anything to stop the cruel water Spirit, since it never slept and constantly gazed upon his possessions with cold eyes.": "纳拉古和她的战士和巫师们都无法阻止这个残酷的水神，因为它从不睡觉，并不断用冷漠的目光注视着他的财产。",

	"It was as if time had stopped, the two spoke all night, not just about how to break free, but they connected in a way that most mortals and spirits don't connect. A special love blossomed in that windy and starry night.": "时间仿佛停止了，两人谈了一整夜，不仅仅是关于如何挣脱的问题，而是他们以一种大多数凡人和灵魂无法联系的方式联系起来。一种特殊的爱在那个多风多星的夜晚开花结果。",
	"The following day, when Nalagu woke up, the woman was gone and in her heart she knew that that was the same being which had appeared earlier in her dream as an Eland.": "第二天，当娜拉古醒来时，那个女人已经走了，她心里明白，那就是早先在她梦中出现的埃兰的那个生命。",
	"Suddenly everyone had gained horns and a newfound strength: they knew they were finally true children of the savanna. They all rose against the cruel Spirit and banished it deep into the lake.": "突然间，每个人都获得了角和新发现的力量：他们知道自己终于成为草原上真正的孩子。他们都起来反对残酷的精神，把它驱逐到湖的深处。",
	"Victorious, Nalangu and her people reclaimed their cattle and possessions and broke free from their last chains, never to look back again.": "纳兰古和她的人民取得了胜利，夺回了他们的牛和财产，挣脱了最后的枷锁，再也没有回头。",
	"Traditionally Swala communities are organised around the concept of Ol-aramatani \"shepherd\". Legendary queen Nalagu is often considered the first Ol-aramatani. An Ol-aramatani is not a queen or king though, but rather someone that is an expert at something in the community and therefore considered a natural leader. Some Ol-aramatani are chosen from the whole village, some by the previous one, some even randomly–there are no specific rules and it depends on the local customs. Swala like to say \"no two Ol-aramatani are the same\"": "传统上，斯瓦拉社区是围绕着Ol-aramatani \"牧羊人 \"的概念组织的。传说中的娜拉古女王通常被认为是第一位Ol-aramatani。不过，Ol-aramatani不是女王或国王，而是社区中某方面的专家，因此被认为是天然的领导者。有些Ol-aramatani是从全村选出来的，有些是由上一任选出来的，有些甚至是随机选出来的--没有具体的规则，这取决于当地的习俗。斯瓦拉喜欢说 \"没有两个Ol-aramatani是相同的\"。",
	"Many Swalas towns, especially larger ones, have a council of Ol-aramatani that convenes to manage the communal affairs. Often a \"Speaker\" is chosen to represent all the Ol-aramatani, in some cases the Speaker is awarded with some additional executive powers.": "许多斯瓦拉斯城镇，特别是较大的城镇，都有一个由Ol-aramatani组成的理事会，负责管理社区事务。通常会选择一个 \"议长 \"来代表所有的Ol-aramatani，在某些情况下，议长被授予一些额外的行政权力。",
	"An Ol-aramatani can be recognised by their large bladed spear. In ancient times, men Ol-aramatani keprt long braided hair, women Ol-aramatani shaved and other genders mixed and matched (e.g half head shaved). Such customs are less and less frequent.": "奥拉马塔尼人可以通过他们的大刀矛来识别。在古代，男性Ol-aramatani人留长辫子，女性Ol-aramatani人剃光头，其他性别混合搭配（如半边头剃光）。这样的习俗越来越少了。",
	"An important village entity is the \"Laibon\", who is typically a seer and therefore often automatically considered an Ol-aramatani. When several Laibons are in the community, often one is chosen to be the Ol-aramatani Laibon, the head and representative of the oracles.": "一个重要的村庄实体是 \"来本\"，他通常是一个预言家，因此常常被自动视为Ol-aramatani。当社区里有几个来宾时，往往会选择一个来宾作为Ol-aramatani来宾，即神谕的负责人和代表。",
	"Swalas prize their freedom and deeply love their environment. Their main philosophical precept is the \"Umbumwe\" which can be explained as the balance between wilderness and domestication and harmony among things in general. Swalas don't see themselves above nature and spirits but as equal parts of it.": "斯瓦拉人崇尚自由，深爱自己的环境。他们的主要哲学戒律是 \"Umbumwe\"，可以解释为野性与驯化之间的平衡，以及一般事物之间的和谐。斯瓦拉人不认为自己凌驾于自然和精神之上，而是认为自己是自然和精神的平等组成部分。",
	"Umbumwe is often represented as a cow and an eland (sometimes a buffalo) facing each other, two horned creatures, one domesticated and the other wild–both very strong and useful to the Swala.": "Umbumwe通常表现为一头牛和一头麋鹿（有时是水牛）面对面，这两种有角的动物，一种是被驯化的，另一种是野生的--都非常强壮，对斯瓦拉人非常有用。",
	"This concept is sometimes translated as \"harmony\" but it means much more, It means that in order to thrive, people have to actively work to keep things in balance.": "这个概念有时被翻译成 \"和谐\"，但它的含义要多得多，它意味着为了繁荣，人们必须积极努力，保持事物的平衡。",
	"Swala culture is about constant rebalancing and this often leads to lively debates within community councils.": "斯瓦拉文化就是要不断地进行再平衡，这常常导致社区委员会内部的热烈辩论。",
	"Taking care of domesticated animals is Umbumwe as it allows them to thrive and Spiritual hunts are Umbuwe too as they do not exhaust Wagadu's nature.": "照顾被驯养的动物是Umbumwe，因为这样可以让它们茁壮成长，而精神狩猎也是Umbuwe，因为它们不会耗尽Wagadu的自然。",
	"Spirituality contributes to Umbumwe as well. Religious worship is held in \"Hallowed Grasses\", typically grassy areas on hills or around very ancient trees–in such places the Swala worship the spirits of that area and only pay lip service to gods and Ancestors. Spirits are considered to be more important than gods to maintain Umbumwe. Due to the strong focus on Spirit worship, every community's rituals can vary wildly.": "精神信仰对Umbumwe也有贡献。宗教崇拜在 \"神圣的草地 \"举行，通常是山上的草丛或非常古老的树木周围，在这些地方，斯瓦拉人崇拜该地区的神灵，而对神和祖先只是口头上说说。在维持Umbumwe方面，神灵被认为比神灵更重要。由于对神灵崇拜的强烈关注，每个社区的仪式都会有很大的不同。",
	"The relationship with spirits is seen as a harmonic balance, spirits must be worshiped but kept in check as well when they misbehave.": "与神灵的关系被看作是一种和谐的平衡，神灵必须被崇拜，但当它们行为不端时也要加以控制。",
	"Sometimes considered part of Umbumwe, other times as its own philosophy, Guterekera focused on gods and Ancestor worship and on maintaining Swala history.": "Guterekera有时被认为是Umbumwe的一部分，有时则是它自己的哲学，它注重神灵和祖先崇拜，注重维护Swala的历史。",
	"Basically Gutereka is how Swala call all religious practices that do not involve spirits (as those are considered simple Umbumwe), gods and Ancestors are described as somewhat distanced and removed but Guterekera is a reminder that it's detrimental to forget them completely.": "基本上，Gutereka是Swala对所有不涉及神灵的宗教活动的称呼（因为那些被认为是简单的Umbumwe），神和祖先被描述为有些遥远和遥远，但Guterekera是一种提醒，完全忘记他们是有害的。",
	"Due to their ancestral origins, the Swala usually acknowledge the Emere gods, but such worship is left to be fulfilled by \"Banyankole\" wandering priests that tend to the Gods' shrines that dot Swala areas. Large temples are very rare and mostly taken care of by Emere.": "由于他们的祖先起源，斯瓦拉人通常承认埃米尔神，但这种崇拜是由 \"Banyankole \"流浪祭司来完成的，他们照看着遍布斯瓦拉地区的神龛。大型寺庙非常罕见，大多由埃米尔人负责。",
	"Enk-Akui, the Ancestors are addressed by community leaders when making important decisions and in rare other occasions (such as in crossroads).": "Enk-Akui，社区领导人在做出重要决定时和其他罕见的场合（如十字路口）会向祖先致辞。",
	"Whereas Umbumwe is a responsibility of every Swala, Guterekera can be \"delegated\" to specific individuals in the community, such as a Banyankole.": "Umbumwe是每个Swala的责任，而Guterekera可以 \"委托 \"给社区的特定个人，如Banyankole。",
	"A good Swala respects the Umbumwe, by treating well their cattle and all nature and by worshipping Spirits and maintaining fresh offerings for them. Guterekera is typically maintained by supporting and respecting the Banyankole that now and then visits the village.": "一个好的斯瓦拉人尊重Umbumwe，善待他们的牛和所有的自然，崇拜神灵并为他们保持新鲜的祭品。Guterekera通常是通过支持和尊重不时访问村庄的Banyankole来维持。",
	"In Swala cultures, name is considered something that you pick up when you grow up. The \"Embolet\" is a temporary child name and as a teeanger, around 13 years old, a Swala picks their \"adult name\". Surnames are often not picked up from the family but are chosen from a community pool which can be confusing to outsiders. Some Swala have Emere Destiny names but this practice is rare and considered sophisticated and archaic. Name Example: Sironka Adupa.": "在斯瓦拉文化中，名字被认为是长大后取的东西。Embolet \"是一个临时性的儿童名字，而在13岁左右的时候，斯瓦拉人就会选择自己的 \"成人名字\"。姓氏通常不是从家庭中取的，而是从社区中选择的，这可能会让外人感到困惑。有些斯瓦拉人有埃米尔命运的名字，但这种做法很罕见，被认为是复杂和古老的。名字的例子。西隆卡-阿杜帕。",
	"The spiritual and ancestral influences that definite the Swala lineage can manifest in different ways. It is said that Eland's Blessing's Swala are direct descendants of Queen Nalangu's people. The other manifestations were started by people who joined the Lineage later, though this does not make them any less Swala in the eyes of their fellow lineage people.": "确定斯瓦拉血统的精神和祖先的影响可以以不同方式表现出来。据说Eland's Blessing的Swala是Nalangu女王的人的直系后裔。其他的表现形式是由后来加入世系的人开始的，虽然这并不意味着他们在世系同胞的眼中就不是斯瓦拉。",
	"Another symbol of the Ol-aramatin is Rungu mace made from a very rare root-wood that might glow magically.": "奥拉马汀的另一个象征是用一种非常罕见的根木制成的Rungu锏，可能会发出神奇的光芒。",
	"Laibon are the diviners and witch doctors of the Swala, typically respected members of the community. They can be recognised:": "莱邦是斯瓦拉人的占卜师和巫医，通常是社区中受人尊敬的成员。他们可以被认出。",
	"By fly-whisker, sometimes ornately decorated. Herbs, calabashes and pouches with magical ingredient": "由飞须，有时装饰华丽。草药、香囊和装有魔法成分的小袋子",
	"The priests of the Swala are entrusted with keeping the worship of the ancient Emere gods alive within their communities. Compared to Emere temples, which are at the heart of Emere villages, the Banyajokole's shrines are usually small and their ceremonies are often a private thing–within the Swala, ceremonies for local spirits usually outshine those for the Old Gods.": "斯瓦拉的祭司们受托在他们的社区内保持对古代埃米尔神的崇拜。与位于埃米尔村庄中心的埃米尔神庙相比，班亚约科勒的神庙通常很小，他们的仪式通常是私人的事情--在斯瓦拉内部，为当地神灵举行的仪式通常比为古神举行的仪式更重要。",
	"The Banyakole tend to be humble and wear barkcloth or goatskin clothes.": "班亚科勒人往往很谦虚，穿着树皮布或山羊皮的衣服。",
	"Sometimes they follow some additional conventions of Emere priests such as carrying a priestly staff or covering their face with cowries.": "有时他们会遵循埃米尔祭司的一些额外惯例，如携带祭司杖或用牛肝菌遮盖面部。",
	"Swala musicians are Inspired by Spirits and Ancestors and are known for having a special tradition that appears to draw magical energy and inspiration from both entities.": "斯瓦拉音乐家受到神灵和祖先的启发，以拥有特殊的传统而闻名，似乎从这两个实体中汲取神奇的能量和灵感。",
	"The result is a style that recalls both their ancient Emere roots and the sounds of the savanna.": "其结果是一种既让人想起他们古老的埃米尔根源，又让人想起草原的声音的风格。",
	"Swala hunters are famous for their skills. Although they are awesome at handling spears,rungu maces and shortbows, they are most famous for their tracking and survival skills. Swala hunters don't believe in facing risks head-on but like to outwit obstacles as much as they can. Their ritual hunts often involve the submission of a Predator Spirit by beating a lion, leopard or hyena.": "斯瓦拉猎人以其技能而闻名。虽然他们在处理长矛、流星锤和短弓方面很厉害，但他们最出名的是他们的追踪和生存技能。斯瓦拉猎人不相信正面面对风险，而是喜欢尽可能地智取障碍。他们的狩猎仪式经常涉及到通过殴打狮子、豹子或鬣狗来服从捕食者的精神。",
	"This Swala trader tradition is said to have started in large savanna rivers and then developed to the whole of the Upper Realms and Wagadu. These traders are ubiquitous among most Swala communities and have created some sort of subculture which even has its own ancestral language and local travel spirits to worship. Mfanya Biashara are famous for having the most flashy and sophisticated horn jewelry and decorations Wagadu can find.": "这种斯瓦拉商人的传统据说是从大草原的河流开始的，然后发展到整个上界和瓦加杜。这些商人在大多数斯瓦拉社区中无处不在，他们创造了某种亚文化，甚至有自己的祖先语言和当地的旅游精神崇拜。Mfanya Biashara以拥有瓦加杜所能找到的最华丽、最精致的牛角首饰和装饰品而闻名。",
	"These Swalas are said to descend from a Ninki Nanka (the dragons of Wagadu) who made several mortals fall in love. The Mundu-mugo are not just powerful magicians but have the innate ability to recognise their bond when they meet each other, sometimes forming formidable groups with the power to bless or curse who comes across them.": "这些斯瓦拉人据说是Ninki Nanka（瓦加杜的龙）的后代，他让几个凡人坠入爱河。蒙杜-穆戈人不仅是强大的魔法师，而且具有与生俱来的能力，当他们遇到对方时，能够识别他们之间的联系，有时会形成强大的团体，有能力祝福或诅咒遇到他们的人。",

	"Yiite are thought since childhood to be ambitious and to aim higher. This is one reason why they tend to cluster in cities and are rarely seen in rural areas, as farming is considered an unambitious task (the occasional wealthy Yiite farmer might disagree with this, but they are a minority).": "彝族人从小就被认为有野心，目标更高。这也是为什么他们往往聚集在城市，而很少在农村地区出现的原因之一，因为耕作被认为是一项没有野心的任务（偶尔有富裕的彝族农民可能不同意这一点，但他们是少数）。",

The embrace of the Sihiri over Lammu philosophy has reduced but not completely quelled such disputes.": "彝族人之间的政治辩论往往围绕着两种政治结构的优劣展开：一个有议会的君主与一个纯粹的神权。拥护西希里而不拥护拉穆哲学，减少了这种争论，但并没有完全平息。",

	"Most Fire Asiman respect all other tribes and perceive their roles as important within society but a minority considers themselves inherently superior to the other three;There is this perception among Fire Asiman thinkers that just as fire burn things and it's both vital and dangerous, so politics require tradeoffs and balances that a Fire Asiman is better suited to handle.Nonetheless all Yiite agree that it's not a good idea to completely exclude other tribes from power.": "大多数火系阿西曼人尊重所有其他部落，并认为他们在社会中的作用很重要，但也有少数人认为自己天生就比其他三个部落优越；在火系阿西曼人的思想家中，有这样一种看法：就像火烧东西一样，它既重要又危险，所以政治需要权衡和平衡，而火系阿西曼人更适合处理。尽管如此，所有Yiite都认为将其他部落完全排除在权力之外不是一个好主意。",

	"Wind Asimans grow up being taught the value of freedom, for them roaming deserts does not equate only to physical freedom but also to mental one. Wind Asimans quickly learn about the different cities and people they meet in their constant travelling and typically view them as \"constricted\" into their sedentary lifestyles and preconceived ideas. This said, they are relatively open to other folk, especially if the goal is travelling together.": "风族阿西曼人在成长过程中被灌输了自由的价值观，对他们来说，在沙漠中漫游并不仅仅等同于身体上的自由，也等同于精神上的自由。风族阿西曼人很快就了解了他们在不断旅行中遇到的不同城市和人们，并通常认为他们被 \"限制 \"在他们定居的生活方式和先入为主的想法中。这就是说，他们对其他民间人士相对开放，特别是如果目标是一起旅行。",
	"For these reasons Henndu are the least ritualistic of all Asimans, their temples often not even having a mallam (priest). Henndu like to keep things simple.": "由于这些原因，亨杜是所有阿西曼人中最没有仪式感的，他们的寺庙往往甚至没有mallam（祭司）。亨杜人喜欢保持简单的东西。",
	"This tribe's members are also the most open to worshiping spirits. The religious fervor that swept Asiman communities in ancient times and led to quick discarding of spirit worship in favour of the elemental gods seemed never to have fully taken root within the Henndu.": "这个部落的成员也是最愿意崇拜神灵的。在古代，宗教狂热席卷了阿西曼社区，导致人们迅速抛弃了对神灵的崇拜，转而崇拜元素之神，这种狂热似乎从未在亨杜人中完全扎根。",
	"Of course they worship the Twelve Gods, like all Asiman, but it's not uncommon to find a \"caravan temple\" which transports effigies of the Gods together with those of local spirits, and, shockingly for other Asimans, the travellers might spend the same amount of time worshipping both types.": "当然，他们像所有阿西曼人一样崇拜十二神，但也不乏有 \"商队神庙\"，将神像和当地神灵的神像放在一起，而且，令其他阿西曼人震惊的是，旅行者可能花同样多的时间来崇拜这两种神像。",
	"For this reason witch-doctors are more common among the Henndu than other Asiman.": "由于这个原因，巫医在亨杜人中比其他阿西曼人更常见。",

	"Just like Fire Asimans, Ndyam love magic, but whereas the former tend to focus on the power that derives from its use, the latter relish in the process of discovering more of it and in the secrets its use unlocks.": "就像火阿西曼人一样，恩迪亚姆也喜欢魔法，但前者倾向于专注于使用魔法所带来的力量，后者则乐于发现更多的魔法和使用魔法所带来的秘密。",
	"For such reasons, Ndyam tend to prefer the magician profession over priesthood and even when choosing the latter, they tend to focus on theoretical concepts and religious lore.": "由于这样的原因，恩迪亚姆倾向于选择魔法师职业而不是神职，即使选择后者，他们也倾向于专注于理论概念和宗教传说。",
	"Ndyam are very likely to travel, though whereas Wind Asimans enjoy vast expanses and the wilderness, Water Asimans tend to go from city to city, collecting new and interesting relics and stories.": "Ndyam非常喜欢旅行，不过风系阿西曼人喜欢广袤的土地和荒野，而水系阿西曼人则倾向于从一个城市到另一个城市，收集新的、有趣的遗物和故事。",
	"Water Asimans are adaptable and are often able to cover different roles in a community. Ndyam Sarkis (chiefs) have a reputation of being very wise though slow to act, Ndyam merchants of knowing a great deal about their product but not money driven enough, and Ndyam farmers of coming up with great irrigation systems but spending too little time on growing their fields.": "水阿西曼人适应性强，通常能够在社区中担任不同的角色。Ndyam Sarkis（酋长）的名声是非常聪明，但行动缓慢；Ndyam商人对他们的产品了解很多，但对金钱的追求不够；Ndyam农民想出了很好的灌溉系统，但花在种田上的时间太少。",
	"Taken with a pinch of salt, these descriptions do not stray too much from reality.": "带着一撮盐，这些描述并没有太过偏离现实。",
	"Ndyams have a unique way of describing themselves and their leanings. This is by no means a strict separation, one can describe themselves with all of these adjectives throughout a day, but Ndyams tend to identify more with one or the other.": "Ndyams有一种独特的方式来描述自己和他们的倾向。这绝不是严格的区分，一个人可以在一天中用所有这些形容词来描述自己，但Ndyams倾向于更多地认同一个或另一个。",
