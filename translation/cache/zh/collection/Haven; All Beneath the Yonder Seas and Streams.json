	"Kuo-toa are degenerate fishlike humanoids that once inhabited the shores and islands of the surface world. Long ago, humans and their ilk drove the kuo-toa underground, where they currently dwell in madness and everlasting night, surrounded by gods of their own creation.": "Kuo-toa是退化的鱼形人，曾经居住在地面世界的海岸和岛屿上。很久以前，人类和他们的同类把Kuo-toa赶到了地下，目前他们住在疯狂和永恒的黑夜中，被他们自己创造的神所包围。",
	"Short, pale, and covered in slimy scales, kuo-toa are monstrous humanoids whose physiology has been shaped by their time in the underdark. These creatures are generally shorter than humans, standing approximately 5 feet tall on average. They have webbed hands and feet, ideal for wading through the swampy habitats that they dwell in. A kuo-toa's body is topped with a fishlike head, complete with a mouthful of sharp teeth and a pair of bulging, silvery eyes with tiny, black pupils. Their eyes are capable of swiveling independently, which improves their peripheral vision but tends to be unsettling to observe.": "矮小、苍白、覆盖着粘稠的鳞片，Kuo-toa是畸形的人形生物，他们的生理结构是在黑暗中形成的。这些生物通常比人类矮，平均身高约5英尺。他们的手和脚都有蹼，非常适合在他们居住的沼泽地中涉水。kuo-toa的身体顶部有一个鱼一样的头，有一口锋利的牙齿和一对隆起的、银色的眼睛，有小小的黑色瞳孔。它们的眼睛能够独立旋转，这改善了它们的周边视野，但观察起来往往会让人不安。",
	"A kuo-toa's scales can come in a range of colors, including shades of grey, muted greens, and pale yellows. In some of these creatures, their scale's pigmentation could change with their emotional state, becoming reddish when angered or pale white when terrified, for example. Their scaly skin is covered in a layer of slippery slime, giving them a glistening sheen. They often wear simple clothing, consisting of dirty rags and leather straps, alongside accessories made from bones, shells, or gems.": "kuo-toa的鳞片可以有一系列的颜色，包括灰色的阴影、柔和的绿色和淡淡的黄色。在某些生物中，它们的鳞片的色素会随着它们的情绪状态而改变，例如，在被激怒时变成红色，在被吓坏时变成淡白色。它们的鳞片皮肤上覆盖着一层滑溜溜的粘液，使它们具有闪亮的光泽。他们经常穿着简单的衣服，由肮脏的破布和皮革带子组成，还有用骨头、贝壳或宝石制成的饰品。",
	"As the kuo-toa festered in the underdark, so too did their society of high priests and their underlings form. Their society is completely theocratic; any who do not worship the specific god of the high priest are generally executed or exiled to the surface. Given the general opinion of the kuo-toa among the rest of civilization, these punishments usually end the same way. ": "随着Kuo-toa在黑暗中的发酵，他们的大祭司和他们的下属社会也随之形成。他们的社会是完全神权主义的；任何不崇拜大祭司的特定神的人一般都会被处决或被流放到地面。鉴于其他文明中对Kuo-toa的普遍看法，这些惩罚通常以同样的方式结束。",
	"The gods of the kuo-toa differ from other races they are constructions of the kuo-toas' own imagination, as their collective consciousness can form godlike beings. Lesser kuo-toa are treated like slaves with dissent being impossible due to their own crazed fanaticism to their faith. ": "国土人的神与其他种族不同，他们是国土人自己想象出来的，因为他们的集体意识可以形成神的存在。较小的国土人被当作奴隶对待，由于他们对自己的信仰有疯狂的狂热，所以不可能有异议。",
	"The kuo-toa were not always as insane as they are now. Once a humble surface race, exile to the Underdark combined with endless conflict with the illithid lead to countless centuries of cruelty, enslavement, and magical domination.  Now almost entirely insane, even independent kuo-toa communities have been permanently driven to new heights of madness from this long association. Gods and priests rise and fall in a never ending cycle of mania deep beneath the waves.": "kuo-toa人并不总是像现在这样疯狂。曾经是一个卑微的地表种族，被流放到暗黑世界，再加上与伊利瑟德人的无尽冲突，导致了无数个世纪的残酷、奴役和魔法统治。 现在几乎完全疯了，即使是独立的Kuo-toa社区也在这种长期的联系中被永久地推向了新的疯狂高度。神和祭司们在海浪深处永不停息的狂热循环中崛起和衰落。",
	"If it were not for this unfortunate history, it is possible the kuo-toa would be completely different from the way they are now. Their docile ways when outside of the reaches of kuo-toa society may hint towards such a peaceful past, though whatever sanity they have left is buried under fervent zealotry and misplaced belief.": "如果没有这段不幸的历史，Kuo-toa人可能会和现在完全不同。他们在国土社会之外的温顺方式可能暗示着这样一个和平的过去，尽管他们剩下的任何理智都被埋藏在狂热的狂热和错位的信仰之下。",
	"Although gods can be formed by the fanatical belief of groups of kuo-toa, a lone individual's faith isn't powerful enough to create a true divine being. Instead, a single kuo-toa that believes that an object is a divine being can create a {@creature kuo-toa idol|ABYSS}, a creature that is closer to a familiar than a god.": "虽然神可以由一群国土人的狂热信仰形成，但一个人的信仰还不足以创造出真正的神灵。相反，相信某个物体是神灵的单个国土人可以创造一个（%0%），一个比神灵更接近于熟悉的生物。",
	"Though these idols are temporary, they are still commonly revered by the kuo-toa as minor divine beings, almost like the guardian angels of their kind.": "虽然这些偶像是暂时的，但他们仍然被国土人普遍尊为小神灵，几乎就像他们这种人的守护天使。",
	"Kuo-toa rarely leave their underground homes, generally only leaving to raid the surface or occasionally do trade with small fishing towns. However it is not unknown for kuo-toa to venture out to the surface on \"holy missions\" of their own deranged mind. As well those small towns they do trade with will occasionally take a lesser kuo-toa to live permanently on the surface for whatever reason they desire.": "Kuo-toa很少离开他们的地下家园，一般只离开去袭击地表，或偶尔与小渔镇做贸易。然而，Kuo-toa冒险去地表执行他们自己疯狂的 \"神圣任务\"，这并不罕见。此外，那些与他们进行贸易的小城镇，偶尔也会因为他们想要的任何原因，让一个较小的Kuo-toa在地面上长期生活。",
	"Most other races see the kuo-toa as monsters, and will attack on sight. However if a kuo-toa can establish that it is not a threat, it may be able to coexist with the races of the surface. Their insanity can be oddly charming, like watching a child struggle to use a toy. Lesser kuo-toa are sometimes adopted by people like exotic pets.": "大多数其他种族将Kuo-toa视为怪物，一见到就会攻击。然而，如果国土人能够确定它不是一个威胁，它可能会与地面上的种族共存。他们的疯狂可能是奇怪的迷人，就像看着一个孩子挣扎着使用一个玩具。较小的Kuo-toa有时会被人们当作外来宠物来收养。",
	"Kuo-toa names are often incomprehensible and unpronounceable to most tongues. These names appear to be a seemingly-random combination of letters, often with only one vowel being used several times in the name.": "Kuo-toa的名字往往让人难以理解，对大多数舌头来说无法发音。这些名字似乎是字母的随机组合，往往只有一个元音在名字中被多次使用。",
