Long ago, humans and their ilk drove the kuo-toa underground, where they currently dwell in madness and everlasting night, surrounded by gods of their own creation.": "Kuo-toa是退化的鱼形人，曾经居住在地面世界的海岸和岛屿上。很久以前，人类和他们的同类把Kuo-toa赶到了地下，目前他们住在疯狂和永恒的黑夜中，被他们自己创造的神所包围。",
	"Short, pale, and covered in slimy scales, kuo-toa are monstrous humanoids whose physiology has been shaped by their time in the underdark. These creatures are generally shorter than humans, standing approximately 5 feet tall on average. They have webbed hands and feet, ideal for wading through the swampy habitats that they dwell in. A kuo-toa's body is topped with a fishlike head, complete with a mouthful of sharp teeth and a pair of bulging, silvery eyes with tiny, black pupils. Their eyes are capable of swiveling independently, which improves their peripheral vision but tends to be unsettling to observe.": "矮小、苍白、覆盖着粘稠的鳞片，Kuo-toa是畸形的人形生物，他们的生理结构是在黑暗中形成的。这些生物通常比人类矮，平均身高约5英尺。他们的手和脚都有蹼，非常适合在他们居住的沼泽地中涉水。kuo-toa的身体顶部有一个鱼一样的头，有一口锋利的牙齿和一对隆起的、银色的眼睛，有小小的黑色瞳孔。它们的眼睛能够独立旋转，这改善了它们的周边视野，但观察起来往往会让人不安。",
	"A kuo-toa's scales can come in a range of colors, including shades of grey, muted greens, and pale yellows. In some of these creatures, their scale's pigmentation could change with their emotional state, becoming reddish when angered or pale white when terrified, for example. Their scaly skin is covered in a layer of slippery slime, giving them a glistening sheen. They often wear simple clothing, consisting of dirty rags and leather straps, alongside accessories made from bones, shells, or gems.": "kuo-toa的鳞片可以有一系列的颜色，包括灰色的阴影、柔和的绿色和淡淡的黄色。在某些生物中，它们的鳞片的色素会随着它们的情绪状态而改变，例如，在被激怒时变成红色，在被吓坏时变成淡白色。它们的鳞片皮肤上覆盖着一层滑溜溜的粘液，使它们具有闪亮的光泽。他们经常穿着简单的衣服，由肮脏的破布和皮革带子组成，还有用骨头、贝壳或宝石制成的饰品。",
	"As the kuo-toa festered in the underdark, so too did their society of high priests and their underlings form. Their society is completely theocratic; any who do not worship the specific god of the high priest are generally executed or exiled to the surface. Given the general opinion of the kuo-toa among the rest of civilization, these punishments usually end the same way. ": "随着Kuo-toa在黑暗中的发酵，他们的大祭司和他们的下属社会也随之形成。他们的社会是完全神权主义的；任何不崇拜大祭司的特定神的人一般都会被处决或被流放到地面。鉴于其他文明中对Kuo-toa的普遍看法，这些惩罚通常以同样的方式结束。",
	"The gods of the kuo-toa differ from other races they are constructions of the kuo-toas' own imagination, as their collective consciousness can form godlike beings. Lesser kuo-toa are treated like slaves with dissent being impossible due to their own crazed fanaticism to their faith. ": "国土人的神与其他种族不同，他们是国土人自己想象出来的，因为他们的集体意识可以形成神的存在。较小的国土人被当作奴隶对待，由于他们对自己的信仰有疯狂的狂热，所以不可能有异议。",
	"The kuo-toa were not always as insane as they are now. Once a humble surface race, exile to the Underdark combined with endless conflict with the illithid lead to countless centuries of cruelty, enslavement, and magical domination.  Now almost entirely insane, even independent kuo-toa communities have been permanently driven to new heights of madness from this long association. Gods and priests rise and fall in a never ending cycle of mania deep beneath the waves.": "kuo-toa人并不总是像现在这样疯狂。曾经是一个卑微的地表种族，被流放到暗黑世界，再加上与伊利瑟德人的无尽冲突，导致了无数个世纪的残酷、奴役和魔法统治。 现在几乎完全疯了，即使是独立的Kuo-toa社区也在这种长期的联系中被永久地推向了新的疯狂高度。神和祭司们在海浪深处永不停息的狂热循环中崛起和衰落。",
	"If it were not for this unfortunate history, it is possible the kuo-toa would be completely different from the way they are now. Their docile ways when outside of the reaches of kuo-toa society may hint towards such a peaceful past, though whatever sanity they have left is buried under fervent zealotry and misplaced belief.": "如果没有这段不幸的历史，Kuo-toa人可能会和现在完全不同。他们在国土社会之外的温顺方式可能暗示着这样一个和平的过去，尽管他们剩下的任何理智都被埋藏在狂热的狂热和错位的信仰之下。",
	"Although gods can be formed by the fanatical belief of groups of kuo-toa, a lone individual's faith isn't powerful enough to create a true divine being. Instead, a single kuo-toa that believes that an object is a divine being can create a {@creature kuo-toa idol|ABYSS}, a creature that is closer to a familiar than a god.": "虽然神可以由一群国土人的狂热信仰形成，但一个人的信仰还不足以创造出真正的神灵。相反，相信某个物体是神灵的单个国土人可以创造一个（%0%），一个比神灵更接近于熟悉的生物。",
	"Though these idols are temporary, they are still commonly revered by the kuo-toa as minor divine beings, almost like the guardian angels of their kind.": "虽然这些偶像是暂时的，但他们仍然被国土人普遍尊为小神灵，几乎就像他们这种人的守护天使。",
	"Kuo-toa rarely leave their underground homes, generally only leaving to raid the surface or occasionally do trade with small fishing towns. However it is not unknown for kuo-toa to venture out to the surface on \"holy missions\" of their own deranged mind. As well those small towns they do trade with will occasionally take a lesser kuo-toa to live permanently on the surface for whatever reason they desire.": "Kuo-toa很少离开他们的地下家园，一般只离开去袭击地表，或偶尔与小渔镇做贸易。然而，Kuo-toa冒险去地表执行他们自己疯狂的 \"神圣任务\"，这并不罕见。此外，那些与他们进行贸易的小城镇，偶尔也会因为他们想要的任何原因，让一个较小的Kuo-toa在地面上长期生活。",
	"Most other races see the kuo-toa as monsters, and will attack on sight. However if a kuo-toa can establish that it is not a threat, it may be able to coexist with the races of the surface. Their insanity can be oddly charming, like watching a child struggle to use a toy. Lesser kuo-toa are sometimes adopted by people like exotic pets.": "大多数其他种族将Kuo-toa视为怪物，一见到就会攻击。然而，如果国土人能够确定它不是一个威胁，它可能会与地面上的种族共存。他们的疯狂可能是奇怪的迷人，就像看着一个孩子挣扎着使用一个玩具。较小的Kuo-toa有时会被人们当作外来宠物来收养。",

	"The karkinos are a race of powerful but furtive crustacean humanoids.

Normally gentle giants, in times of trouble karkinos can become valiant heroes who rise up to protect their ocean home.": "卡基诺人是一个强大但狡猾的甲壳类人的种族。作为一个没有家园的种族，他们是和平的牧民，在水下领域之间漂流，帮助那些寻求帮助的人，并远离那些试图伤害他们的人的道路。通常情况下，卡基诺人是温和的巨人，但在困难时期，他们会成为英勇的英雄，奋起保护他们的海洋家园。",
	"The karkinos have a muddied origin; some say that they were once a race of surface folk who were cursed into their current forms, while others claim they migrated from the Elemental Plane of water alongside the tritons. The karkinos themselves have conflicting legends, owing to their nomadic lifestyle resulting in many cultural groups emerging, each attesting to their own lore.": "卡基诺人的起源并不清楚，有人说他们曾经是一个被诅咒成现在这个样子的地表民族，也有人说他们是从水元素界和特里顿人一起迁移过来的。卡基诺人本身也有相互矛盾的传说，因为他们的游牧生活方式导致了许多文化群体的出现，每个人都证明了自己的传说。",
	"Regardless of their origins, most karkinos, especially those who hold to traditional beliefs, live a life of idyllic pastoralism. Herding flocks of giant crustaceans, schools of fish, and other placid oceanic life, karkinos families spend their days gazing into the endless depths and ruminating on the nature of the sea. Some karkinos are poets, whose musings are spread far and wide through underwater society, sung and rewritten as ballads and plays. Others isolate themselves far away from civilization with nothing more than their family or flocks for company. Living lives of quiet contemplation, they meditate on ancient truths only known to the long-lived and mysterious karkinos.": "不管他们的出身如何，大多数卡基诺人，特别是那些坚持传统信仰的人，都过着田园牧歌式的生活。驱赶着成群的巨型甲壳类动物、鱼群和其他平静的海洋生物，卡基诺人的家庭整天凝视着无尽的深海，思考着海洋的本质。有些卡基诺人是诗人，他们的思考在水下社会中广为流传，被唱成和改写成歌谣和戏剧。其他人则将自己隔离在远离文明的地方，与家人或羊群为伴。他们过着安静的沉思生活，沉思着只有长寿而神秘的卡基诺人知道的古老真理。",
	"Typically dwelling at the seafloor, the existence of the karkinos is something known only to daring ocean adventurers, though legends about these mysterious crustacean people do spring up from time to time amid sailors and fishermen. Tritons, merfolk, and other intelligent civilizations of the sea may interact with the karkinos more frequently, though even then the karkinos' nomadic and secluded lifestyle makes these interactions relatively rare and spontaneous.": "卡基诺人通常居住在海底，只有大胆的海洋冒险家才知道他们的存在，尽管关于这些神秘的甲壳动物的传说在水手和渔民中时有出现。海龙、人鱼和其他海洋智能文明可能会更频繁地与卡基诺人互动，但即使如此，卡基诺人游牧和隐蔽的生活方式也使这些互动相对罕见和自发。",
	"Despite their peaceful and quiet ways, the karkinos are known too for great heroism in times of need. With a creed to suffer no injustice and to extend aid where possible, most karkinos are happy to lend a claw to passing merfolk, triton, or even surface races where possible, though these encounters may be rare. Some karkinos go above and beyond, and utilize their prodigious natural strength and defenses to protect those who have need of it. These karkinos are often those who depart from their families to seek adventure, striking an impressive silhouette among groups of aquatic adventurers.": "尽管卡基诺人以和平和安静的方式生活，但他们在需要的时候也以伟大的英雄主义而闻名。他们的信条是不遭受不公正待遇，并在可能的情况下提供帮助，大多数卡基诺人很乐意向路过的人鱼族、特里顿族，甚至是可能的地表种族伸出爪子，尽管这些遭遇可能很少。有些卡基诺人则更胜一筹，利用他们惊人的自然力量和防御力来保护那些有需要的人。这些卡基诺人通常是那些离开家庭去寻求冒险的人，在水生冒险者群体中，他们的身影令人印象深刻。",
	"Even besides these heroic individuals, the karkinos have a long rivalry with malicious creatures of the deep. Sahuagin who terrorize other races, krakens fouling the waters, and other beasts of the deep are all ancestral enemies of the karkinos, and they require little persuasion to mobilize against such threats. In times of turmoil, the karkinos usually prove to be vigilant guardians who rise up above the chaos to protect the safety of the oceans. For that reason, tritons and karkinos have traditionally had a good relationship, both being defenders of the ocean.": "即使除了这些英雄人物，卡基诺人与深海中的恶意生物也有长期的竞争关系。恐吓其他种族的萨瓦金（Sahuagin）、污染水域的克拉肯（Krakens）以及其他深海野兽都是卡基诺人的祖传敌人，他们不需要什么说服力就能动员起来对付这些威胁。在动乱时期，卡基诺人通常被证明是警惕的守护者，他们在混乱中崛起，保护海洋的安全。由于这个原因，特里顿人和卡基诺人历来关系良好，都是海洋的保卫者。",
	"In ancient times, it is said that the crab-folk once had a homeland known as Karkos. A legendary city of resplendent gold and coral, it was a mythic land of plenty and wonder, considered the jewel of the sea. Many karkinos families still claim to possess relics from this wondrous age, although few truly believe they have a treasure from the fabled city itself, only an old heirloom from a bygone era.": "在古代，据说螃蟹人曾经有一个被称为卡克斯的家园。它是一座由璀璨的黄金和珊瑚组成的传奇城市，是一片富饶而神奇的神话之地，被认为是海洋的瑰宝。许多卡基诺家族仍然声称拥有这个神奇时代的遗物，尽管很少有人真正相信他们拥有来自传说中的城市本身的宝藏，只是一个来自过去时代的古老传家宝。",
	"The tale, as it goes, describes Karkos falling into a state of hubris and debauchery. The most powerful of Karkos were swayed into evil by a malicious kraken, and attempted to harness and control the very currents of the ocean, to bend the sea to their will. In retribution, the spirits of the sea sent a mighty sea titan to swallow up the entirety of Karkos, sweeping the city into the eternal depths, never to be seen again. While most karkinos believe this to be nothing more than a moral fable, they still point to it as reason for their humble life and staunch opposition to the darker denizens of the sea.": "这个故事，正如它所描述的那样，Karkos陷入了一种狂妄和放荡的状态。卡寇斯最强大的人被一个恶意的克拉肯动摇了，并试图利用和控制海洋的水流，使海洋屈服于他们的意志。为了报复，海的灵魂派了一个强大的海中泰坦来吞噬整个卡寇斯，把这个城市扫入永恒的深渊，再也看不到了。虽然大多数卡基诺人认为这只不过是一个道德寓言，但他们仍然将其作为他们卑微生活的理由，并坚定地反对海洋中的黑暗居民。",
	"The city of Karkos, the protector of the karkinos, is regarded as fable by many. However, ancient {@creature Karkos|ABYSS} slumbers beneath the waves.": "卡寇斯城，卡寇斯的保护者，被很多人认为是寓言。然而，古老的（%0%）沉睡在海浪之下。",
	"Karkinos names are often difficult to pronounce by most tongues, due to their crustacean nature, with many hard clicks and other harsh sounds. Karkinos who decide to befriend non-karkinos individuals typically have a nickname derived from a simplified form of their true name. Karkinos, being natural hermaphrodites, have little use for gender dimorphism and their names follow a similar thread, though some karkinos do choose to adopt a pronoun for ease of communication.": "卡基诺人的名字往往很难被大多数人念出来，这是因为他们的甲壳类动物的特性，有许多硬的咔嚓声和其他刺耳的声音。决定与非卡基诺人交朋友的卡基诺人通常会有一个由他们的真名的简化形式衍生出来的绰号。卡基诺人是天然的雌雄同体，对性别差异没有什么用处，他们的名字也遵循类似的思路，尽管有些卡基诺人选择采用一个代名词以方便交流。",

	"There are other races throughout the multiverse that bear a striking resemblance to the karkinos—for example, the aldani of the Forgotten Realms, the sartani, and the crab men that are scattered throughout the annals of history.
