	"Starting at 14th level, during a long rest you can consult the stars and comprehend some meaning in a cosmic event. The stars must be visible to you for you to use this ability. The insight you gather is stored as a small reserve of magic inside an item that has meaning to you; a star chart or astrolabe is commonly used, but any item that can be held in your hand will suffice. When the item is in your hand, you can consume that stored magic as a bonus action to invoke one of the following effects. The insight is expended by one use, and it's lost if it hasn't been used within 24 hours or by the start of your next long rest.": "从14级开始，在长时间的休息中，你可以咨询星星并理解宇宙事件中的一些意义。你必须看到星星才能使用这个能力。你所收集到的洞察力会作为一个小的魔法储备储存在对你有意义的物品中；通常使用星图或星盘，但任何可以拿在手上的物品都足够了。当物品在你手中时，你可以将储存的魔力作为一个额外动作来消耗，以唤起下列效果之一。洞察力会在一次使用中消耗掉，如果在24小时内或在你下一次长时间休息开始前没有使用，它就会消失。",

	"Eclipses plunge the world into darkness and strengthen connections to the shadow plane. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that causes necrotic damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.": "日蚀使世界陷入黑暗，并加强与影界的联系。当你施展五级或更低级的法术造成坏死性伤害时，你可以重新掷出一定数量的伤害骰子，其数量不超过你的智力修正值（最小为1）。你必须使用新的卷轴。",
