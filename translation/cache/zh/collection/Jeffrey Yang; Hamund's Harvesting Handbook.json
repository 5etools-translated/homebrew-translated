	"This guide mostly assumes that harvesting takes place on a freshly killed corpse and that little to no decomposition has yet occurred. However, in some cases, a player may desire to harvest a creature that has been dead for quite a while. In these cases, the DM may declare that certain body parts have already withered away and become un-harvestable or may decide to increase the DCs of all harvestable materials as if the creature had died a particularly violent death. If corpse decomposition is too advanced, it is entirely within the DM's right to deny harvesting the creature altogether.": "本指南主要假设收获发生在刚被杀死的尸体上，而且几乎没有发生腐烂。然而，在某些情况下，玩家可能希望收获一个已经死了很久的生物。在这种情况下，DM可以宣布某些身体部位已经枯萎，变得无法收获，或者可以决定增加所有可收获材料的DC，就好像该生物死得特别惨烈一样。如果尸体腐烂得太厉害，DM完全有权利拒绝收割该生物。",
	"As a quick guide, the following timeline may be observed to decide on decomposition levels:": "作为一个快速指南，可以观察以下时间线来决定分解水平。",
	"The carcass' hide has ruptured from bloating and has become useless.": "尸体的皮已经因膨胀而破裂，变得毫无用处。",
	"The carcass' blood has become too tainted to be useful, and soft tissues like the eyes have putrefied.": "尸体的血液已经被污染得无法使用，眼睛等软组织已经腐烂。",
	"The carcass' internal organs have decomposed.": "尸体的内部器官已经腐烂。",
	"The carcass has undergone extensive purification and none of its soft tissue remains harvestable.": "尸体经过了广泛的净化处理，其软组织没有一个可以收获。",
	"Harder materials like bones, teeth, claws, and hair do not generally undergo decomposition and will remain usable indefinitely.": "像骨头、牙齿、爪子和头发等较硬的材料一般不会发生分解，并将无限期地保持可用。",
	"Harvesting some creatures are more dangerous than others. While most creatures are harmless once killed, others possess poisons, acids, and breath sacks that remain active even after the creature's death. Even worse is that a simple misplaced knife stroke or errant twitch of the hand can lead to these materials accidentally harming the harvester.": "收获一些生物比其他生物更危险。虽然大多数生物在被杀死后是无害的，但有些生物拥有毒药、酸和呼吸袋，即使在生物死亡后仍然有效。更糟糕的是，一个简单的错误的刀口或错误的手部抽动就会导致这些材料意外地伤害到收割者。",
	"Under this optional rule, whenever a harvester rolls below the DC of a harvestable material that has a \"Use\" section that deals damage, the material is not just lost, it also expends its ability on the harvester. For example, a character that fails to properly harvest a poison would suffer the effect of that poison on themselves, or a character that fails to harvest a breath sack would release the effect of that breath sack in their direction. The exact adjudication of the failure result may change depending on the DM.": "在这个可选的规则下，每当收割者的卷轴低于有 \"使用 \"部分造成伤害的可收割材料的DC时，该材料就不仅仅是损失了，它还会在收割者身上消耗其能力。例如，一个未能正确收割毒药的角色会在自己身上受到该毒药的影响，或者一个未能收割呼吸袋的角色会向自己的方向释放该呼吸袋的影响。对失败结果的确切裁决可能会根据DM的不同而改变。",
	"Not all crafters are created equal. While a village blacksmith may be good at fixing scythes and making nails, if you hand them a dragon scale, the best you will get back is a ruined dragon scale and an apologetic look. If you have high quality materials, you're going to need a high quality crafter.": "并非所有的手艺人都是平等的。虽然村里的铁匠可能擅长修理镰刀和制作钉子，但如果你把龙鳞交给他们，你得到的最好的回报就是一片被毁坏的龙鳞和一个抱歉的表情。如果你有高质量的材料，你将需要一个高质量的工匠。",
	"While under the base rules, anyone can craft anything so long as they meet the base proficiency requirements, under this optional rule, crafters are differentiated based on their proficiency bonus. A crafter may craft any item whose rarity is equal to or below their proficiency bonus as outlined in the {@table Crafting Skill Proficiency|HHHVI} table {@homebrew below|on the next page}.": "在基本规则下，只要满足基本的熟练度要求，任何人都可以制作任何东西，而在这个可选的规则下，制作者是根据他们的熟练度奖励来区分的。工匠可以制作任何稀有度等于或低于其熟练度奖励的物品，如{@table Crafting Skill Proficiency|HHHVI}表{@homebrew below|on the next page}中所述。",
	"This guide adds in the new tool: the {@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}. Players may have proficiency in this like any other tool, and it is highly advised for them to have it as it provides a valuable bonus when making the checks outlined in this book. In order to accommodate this additional tool, the following classes and backgrounds have been slightly altered to give them the option to gain proficiency in the {@item Harvesting Kit|HHHVI}.": "本指南加入了新的工具：（%0%）。玩家可以像其他工具一样熟练掌握它，我们强烈建议他们拥有它，因为它在进行本书所述的检查时提供了宝贵的奖励。为了适应这个额外的工具，以下等级和背景被稍作修改，以使他们可以选择获得（%1%）的熟练度。",

	"The {@background Outlander|PHB} background may choose between a musical instrument or the {@item harvesting kit|HHHVI} as its initial tool proficiency.

	"Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting \"Crone's Disease.\" Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone's disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone's disease as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.": "也许反映了她们生前的唾弃天性，女巫即使在死后也会继续表现出无与伦比的报复性。在她们死后，女巫的体液中会立即发生一种反应，使她们成为传播 \"老妪病 \"的媒介。每当一个生物吸收了已故老巫婆的任何体液，他们必须成功地进行一次（%0%）宪法救赎，否则就会感染老妪病。如果一个角色从老巫婆身上收获的东西失败了，那么当他们笨拙地把血溅到口中或开放的伤口中时，也会有感染老妪病的风险。",
	"Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell {@spell greater restoration} may return the creature to their normal appearance.": "感染老妪病后，受害者的一个面部特征/身体部位会立即转变为看起来更像老妪。例如，他们的鼻子可能变成钩状，或者他们的手变得像爪子。每隔24小时，受害者可以再次尝试拯救动作。如果成功，疾病就会结束，随后每隔24小时，有一个被转化的特征会恢复正常。如果失败，另一个面部特征或身体部位会变成更像巫婆，并且疾病继续。每隔7天，任何当前转化的特征都会变成永久性的，即使在疾病被治愈之后。在这一点上，只有恢复性魔法，如咒语（%0%），才能使生物恢复正常的外观。",
	"While afflicted with gut rot, any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer {@damage 4} necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.": "当你患有肠道腐烂症时，任何时候你试图吞咽食物，你都会受到{@damage 4}坏死的伤害，并将食物吐出。在长期休息结束后，你可以再次尝试蓄力，如果成功则结束疾病。",

	"Let's be honest, every Dungeon Master has faced this exact problem at least once: their players have just finished killing a fearsome monster, and their first reaction is to slice it apart for loot.

	"The act of removing useful body parts from a creature is referred to as harvesting. Anything that can be harvested from a creature is referred to as a harvesting material or simply material. In general, only creatures that have died may be harvested, but there may be some exceptions based on context.": "从一个生物身上取下有用的身体部分的行为被称为收获。任何可以从生物身上收获的东西都被称为收获材料或简单的材料。一般来说，只有已经死亡的生物可以被收割，但根据情况可能有一些例外。",

	"Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt, they may instead choose to take a moment first and {@b appraise} the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested and then roll an Intelligence check, adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to that creature (see table below). For example, appraising a {@creature Beholder|MM} (which is an aberrant), the check would be an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, while appraising an {@creature Ogre|MM} (which is a giant) would require an Intelligence ({@skill Medicine}) check.": "在玩家开始砍伐和屠宰他们的猎物之前，他们可以选择先花点时间和{@b appraise}要收获的生物。要做到这一点，他们必须花1分钟时间检查要收获的生物，然后掷出智力检查，如果他们精通与该生物相对应的技能，则加上他们的熟练度奖励（见下表）。例如，鉴定一个(1%)（即异形），检查是智力（(2%)）检查，而鉴定一个(3%)（即巨人）则需要智力（(4%)）检查。",
	"The DC of the check is equal to 8 + the Harvested Creature's CR (treating any CR less than 1 as 0). Success on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement to harvest those materials, any special requirements to harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only attempt one appraisal check per creature.": "检查的DC等于8+收获生物的CR（将任何小于1的CR视为0）。该检查的成功使玩家完全了解该生物身上任何有用的收获材料，收获这些材料的DC要求，收获它们的任何特殊要求，以及这样做的任何潜在风险。此外，该玩家对该生物所做的任何收割检查都是以优势进行的。一个角色对每个生物只能尝试一次评估检查。",
	"Some party members may prefer to let one character handle the appraisal of materials, while another more dextrous character handles the actual harvesting. In this scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred to the player doing the harvesting, so long as the player that performed the appraising assists the harvesting player through the whole duration of the harvest.": "有些党员可能喜欢让一个角色处理材料的鉴定，而另一个更灵活的角色处理实际的收获。在这种情况下，鉴定生物的所有好处都赋予了进行收获的玩家，只要进行鉴定的玩家在整个收获过程中协助收获的玩家。",
	"In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a Dexterity ability check using the same skill proficiency as listed in the above appraising table. For example, a character attempting a harvest check on an Aberrant would receive a bonus equal to their Dexterity modifier and their proficiency in Arcana (if they have any).": "为了收割一个生物，一个角色必须使用与上述鉴定表中所列相同的技能熟练度来进行灵巧能力检查。例如，一个试图对一个异教徒进行收割检查的角色会得到一个相当于他们的灵巧修改器和他们对奥术的熟练程度（如果他们有的话）的奖励。",
	"This check reflects a character's ability to not only properly remove the intended item without damaging it, it also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such as proper preservation and storage techniques.": "这个检查反映了一个人物的能力，他不仅能正确地取出预定的物品而不损坏它，它还涉及到收获的任何辅助要求，如适当的保存和储存技术。",
	"If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill proficiency.": "如果玩家在收获某种生物，或者收获某种类型的材料的生物，DM可以允许他们使用相关的工具熟练度而不是技能熟练度。",
	"For example, the DM may allow a player to add their proficiency with {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB} to their attempt to harvest a mechanical golem or use their proficiency with {@item leatherworker's tools|PHB} when attempting to harvest a creature for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may be replaced by proficiency with the {@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}": "例如，DM可以允许玩家在试图收割一个机械傀儡时加入他们的熟练度（%0%），或者在试图收割一个生物的皮时使用他们的熟练度（%1%）。或者，所有生物类型的熟练度都可以用{@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}的熟练度来代替。",
	"Each individual item in a creature's harvesting table is listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item. Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest an {@creature azer|MM} will reward the player with both \"azer ash\", and \"azer bronze skin\", but not a \"spark of creation\". If they so wish, players may opt to not harvest a material even if they have met the DC threshold to harvest it.": "在一个生物的收获表中，每个单独的项目都在旁边列出了一个DC。玩家做出的任何等于或超过该DC的卷轴都会给予该玩家该物品。奖励是累积的，玩家可以得到每件DC等于或低于其能力检查结果的物品。例如，在收获（%0%）的检查中滚动15，玩家将获得 \"艾泽灰 \"和 \"艾泽铜皮\"，但不会获得 \"创造的火花\"。如果他们愿意，玩家可以选择不收获某种材料，即使他们已经达到了收获它的DC阈值。",
	"Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature. Failure to meet a certain item's DC threshold assumes that the item was made un-salvageable due to the harvester's incompetence.": "一个生物只能进行一次收割尝试。如果不能达到某项物品的DC阈值，则假定该物品是由于收割者的无能而变得无法挽救的。",
	"For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of that material divided by 5. For huge creatures however, it is equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied by 2.": "对于大多数生物来说，收获一种材料所需的时间是以分钟计算的，并且等于该材料的DC除以5。然而对于巨大的生物来说，它等于该材料的DC，而对于巨大的生物，它等于该材料的DC乘以2。",
	"Large or smaller": "大或小",

	"I know that it is a dangerous world out there, and we all must do what we can to survive.

	"This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to harvest died in direct combat and thus already accounts for the idea that you are harvesting creatures that are not in pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent than others and can make harvesting useful materials either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such examples include burning by fire, dissolving from acid, or being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these cases, raise the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5. Alternatively, the DM may decide that well-orchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for harvesting, such as creatures killed mostly through psychic damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases, the DM should lower the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5.": "本指南假定你试图收获的大多数生物都是在直接战斗中死亡的，因此已经考虑到了你收获的生物并非处于原始状态的想法。然而，有些死亡比其他死亡更剧烈，会使收获有用的材料变得非常困难或完全不可能。这些例子包括被火烧，被酸溶解，或者被完全压在石柱下。在这些情况下，将收获该生物的任何材料的DC提高5。另外，DM可能会决定，精心安排的狩猎会产生一个适合收获的尸体，比如那些主要通过精神伤害被杀死的生物，或者那些在一次干净的攻击中被杀死的生物。在这些情况下，DM应该将收获该生物的任何材料的DC降低5。",
	"Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not some of a creature's individual materials have been made useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of their death. Examples may include blood being tainted from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to excessive slashing/piercing damage.": "此外，DM可以裁定一个生物的某些个别材料是否由于它们在死亡过程中施加的影响而变得无用。例子包括血液因中毒而被污染，或者他们的皮毛因过度砍伐/刺伤而变得毫无价值。",
	"After countless autopsies, vivisections, experiments, and just plain butchering, I have amassed what is most likely the most complete set of knowledge regarding the anatomies, uses, and values of the wondrous creatures that inhabit our worlds.

The following is an explanation of how to read the table.": "本书中列出了{@book Monster Manual|MM}中每一种独特的怪物，并附有相关的收获表。当你的玩家尝试收获时，只需在本指南中查找相关的怪物并读出结果（怪物的排列顺序与{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的顺序相同）。以下是对如何阅读该表的解释。",
	"This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that item.": "这是收获该物品所需的DC。任何等于或超过该阈值的收获检查都允许进行该检查的玩家成功收获该物品。",
	"The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Aarakocra Feather (small pouch) or Aboleth Mucus (3 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.": "收到的物品的名称。虽然对于大多数物品来说，玩家只收到一个列出的物品，但有些物品名称旁边有括号。这些括号表示玩家在成功收获后获得的数量，例如。Aarakocra羽毛（小袋）或Aboleth粘液（3瓶）。然而，根据DM的决定，他们可以裁定玩家获得的数量少于或多于规定的数量。这些原因可能包括在掷骰子时获得极高的成功率，或者用某些方法杀死生物。",
	"A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a \"{@b Use}\" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.": "对要收获的物品的简要描述，由Hamund撰写。虽然这通常只是为了调味，但有些物品也有一个\"{@b Use} \"部分。这些物品在收获后可以立即使用，不需要进一步调整或制作。它们的功能在这里的描述框中进行了描述。",
	"Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.": "此外，有些材料的收获要求不仅仅是稳定的手和一把锋利的刀。收获材料的任何额外要求或标准都将在这里列出。",
	"All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependant on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as \"varies\" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.": "所有材料都列出了其基本转售价值。这是一个普通店主愿意为条件良好的材料支付的金额。在改变这个价值时，建议管理员酌情考虑，这取决于店主的心情、环境中的稀有程度、材料的状况等等。一个价值为 \"不等 \"的材料表明，它的用途过于特殊，不能卖给普通店主，而且材料的价值在很大程度上取决于背景。",
	"When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Aboleth Mucus is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the value listed (20 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Aboleth Mucus would be worth 3 × 20 gp = 60 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Aarakocra Feathers are harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: \"small pouch.\" Thus the 8 sp value listed refers to the value of a \"small pouch of Aarakocra Feathers,\" not 8 sp for each individual feather.": "当物品以不连续的数量收获时，列出的价值是指每个单独的物品。例如，Aboleth Mucus是以一套3瓶的形式收获的，所以列出的价值（20 gp）是指每个单独的小瓶（所以成功收获Aboleth Mucus的价值是3 × 20 gp = 60 gp）。然而，当物品被列为不连续的数量时，列出的价值是指整个数量。例如，Aarakocra羽毛的收获量是不确定的，即一个。\"小袋\"。因此，所列出的8西班牙镑的价值是指 \"一小袋Aarakocra羽毛 \"的价值，而不是每根羽毛的8西班牙镑。",
	"The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Death Knight Heart may be worth the high price of 4,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.": "这里列出的价值是基于无数的因素，包括。怪物的CR，宝藏群的平均价值，在制作过程中的使用，怪物是否倾向于单独被发现，该物品是否是可消耗的，成功收获该物品的概率，围绕现有价格的平衡，有时只是为了增加乐趣。这些价格只是作为一个基线，管理员可以根据他们的活动情况自由调整这些价值。DM还要记住，尽管某些物品可能有很高的价值，但不是所有的供应商都想买它们。例如，尽管一颗死亡骑士之心可能值4000金币的高价，但要把它卖给村里的杂货商可能很困难。有时，为一件神秘的物品寻找合适的买家本身就可以成为一个有趣的副线任务，或者干脆作为一个很好的休闲活动。",
	"The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.": "所列物品的重量，单位是磅。这里列出的重量遵循与价值相同的规则；列出的数字是指单个项目的重量，除非该项目是以不明确的数量收获的，在这种情况下，重量是指整个不明确的数量。",
	"Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.": "有些物品虽然珍贵，但需要熟练的工匠将其制作成可用的物品。材料的描述详细说明了它们可以被制作成哪种物品。如果这部分是空白的，则该物品没有与之相关的可制作的物品。",
	"The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.": "本书末尾的制作物品部分详细介绍了制作物品的用法，以及它们的制作要求的细节。一些可制作的物品源自WotC出版的源书。这些物品在括号里有特殊的标签，表示它们来自哪本书。",
	"In general, humanoids do not yield much in the way of harvestable materials. Partly this is just the negative relationship that humanoid evolution has with innate magical abilities, but mostly it's just because polite society frowns upon butchering things that look vaguely like themselves.": "一般来说，人形生物并没有产生多少可收获的材料。部分原因是人形生物的进化与先天的魔法能力有负面的关系，但大部分原因是礼貌的社会不喜欢屠杀那些看起来有点像自己的东西。",
	"Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armor. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.": "本书中列出的大多数人形生物并不拥有许多可供收获的有用材料。为了补充人形生物相对较少的表格，在他们的章节中列出了一个单独的表格，描述可以从这些生物身上掠夺的物品。这些物品往往是随机的小玩意，不是武器或盔甲。更多的时候，它们是相对无用的，只打算用来转卖。",
	"There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.": "偷窃这些饰品不需要检查能力，而且DM可以自由决定这些饰品中哪些可以在典型的尸体上找到（如果有的话）。这些表格的目的主要是作为DM的灵感，在避免肢解人形尸体的恶心活动的同时，满足渴望掠夺的玩家的欲望。",
	"Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.": "与所有收获的物品一样，列出的价值和重量是指该行中各自物品的1个单位。",
	"Aarakocra are an interesting folk. As stoic and flighty as the birds they resemble, they nevertheless make good company when coaxed down from their solitary perches. Interesting as well is that despite being very magical themselves, their wings are relatively useless for any sort of crafting. Perhaps the Wind Dukes of Aaqa realised that having servants everyone would want to hunt would be a bad idea.": "Aarakocra是一个有趣的民族。他们像鸟儿一样坚忍不拔、善于飞翔，但当他们被从孤独的栖息地哄下来时，还是会成为好伙伴。有趣的是，尽管它们本身很有魔力，但它们的翅膀对于任何种类的工艺来说都是相对无用的。也许Aaqa的风公爵们意识到，拥有每个人都想狩猎的仆人是个坏主意。",
	"I have never claimed to be a saint myself, and in my pursuit of rare game and hunts I will admit that I have drawn the ire of more than one angel. While tussling with an angel is a risky proposition, harvesting one is even worse as it comes with the risk of ticking off their celestial patron. But then again, if you've gone far enough down the dark path to kill an angel, you've probably already committed yourself to being on the wrong side of a god's attention.": "我从未声称自己是个圣人，在追求稀有猎物和狩猎的过程中，我承认我招致了不止一位天使的愤怒。虽然与天使打交道是一个冒险的提议，但收获一个天使就更糟糕了，因为它有可能触怒他们的天体守护者。但话又说回来，如果你在黑暗的道路上走得足够远，以至于杀了一个天使，你可能已经承诺要站在一个神的错误一边。",
	"While an angel's parts may be useful, harvesting a good-aligned angel is considered a universally evil act. Most good-aligned gods will condemn any character that perpetuates such a thing, even if the angel being harvested was not theirs. As such, any character attempting to harvest or attune to an item made from an angel that is still in service to a good-aligned god has a {@chance 70|30 percent chance|Curse of the Fallen|You escape a being cursed!|You are cursed!} of being inflicted with the {@i curse of the fallen}.": "虽然天使的部分可能是有用的，但收割一个善良的天使被认为是一种普遍的邪恶行为。大多数善良的神明会谴责任何延续这种行为的角色，即使被收割的天使不是他们的。因此，任何试图收割或调整由仍在为善神服务的天使制成的物品的角色，都有%0%的机会被施加%1%的影响。",
	"While inflicted with the {@i curse of the fallen}, a creature becomes vulnerable to radiant damage and any magical healing that comes from a good-aligned cleric or paladin automatically fails when used on the cursed character. This curse can only be removed if the cursed character spends 24 hours in a vigil at a temple of the god of the angel who they attempted to harvest or whose part they attempted to attune to. After these 24 hours, a follower of that god may then cast the spell {@spell remove curse} to end the curse.": "当受到{@i curse of the fallen}的影响时，生物会变得容易受到辐射伤害，并且任何来自于好的牧师或圣骑士的魔法治疗在对被诅咒的角色使用时都会自动失效。只有当被诅咒的人物在他们试图收割的天使的神庙中守夜24小时，或者试图调整其部位时，这个诅咒才能被解除。在这24小时之后，该神的追随者可以施放咒语（%1%）来结束诅咒。",
	"Beholders are an odd bunch and difficult to define in terms of harvesting. This is because no two beholders are ever similar, varying wildly in anatomy, colour, and appearance. Despite this, each one seems to think of themselves as being perfect in form. It boggles the mind, but you know what they say about beauty.": "看守者是一个奇怪的群体，在收获方面很难定义。这是因为没有两个Beholders是相似的，在解剖学、颜色和外观上都有很大的不同。尽管如此，每个人似乎都认为自己是完美的形式。这让人摸不着头脑，但你知道他们怎么说美。",
	"Bugbears, an annoying bunch and probably my least liked of all the goblinoid races. Their bodies yield little in terms of good harvest other than a few ears for the town guards to nail to their walls. Their satchels carry even less; most of it useless things a bugbear in its stupidity thought was valuable, or loot so poorly cared for it has lost any value.": "虫熊，是一群恼人的家伙，可能是我最不喜欢的所有地精类种族。他们的身体除了给镇上的守卫钉在墙上的几只耳朵之外，几乎没有什么好的收获。他们的挎包里的东西就更少了；大部分都是无用的东西，一个愚蠢的虫熊认为是有价值的，或者是被照顾得很差的战利品，已经失去了任何价值。",
	"Bullywugs possess little of value, and what they do have will probably be of little value soon anyway. I dislike even pilfering the pockets of the bullywugs I defeat as everything they own inevitably becomes covered in a thin layer of slime.": "恶霸拥有的价值不大，而且他们所拥有的东西可能很快就没有价值了。我甚至不喜欢偷窃我打败的恶霸的口袋，因为他们拥有的一切都不可避免地被一层薄薄的粘液覆盖。",
	"Centaurs are a fascinating bunch, and I have had the pleasure of living with a tribe for a prolonged time and getting to study their cultures. While others may see them as savage and uncivilised, they partake in wonderful games and acrobatics during their festivals. Indeed, as strange as the idea may be, I once saw a group of centaurs stacking themselves upon one another in a dizzyingly high tower! There are some wizards out there that have attempted to disprove my claim, stating that such an occurrence is ludicrous and impossible given a centaur's anatomy, but I swear on my life it is true.": "半人马是一个迷人的群体，我曾有幸与一个部落长期生活在一起，并研究他们的文化。虽然其他人可能认为他们是野蛮和未开化的，但他们在节日里会参加精彩的游戏和杂技表演。事实上，尽管这个想法可能很奇怪，但我曾经看到一群半人马在一个令人眩晕的高塔中相互堆叠！这就是半人马。有一些巫师试图反驳我的说法，说这种情况是可笑的，从半人马的解剖结构来看是不可能的，但我以生命发誓这是真的。",
	"Demons are a nasty bunch, and even nastier to harvest. Looking past the fact that they possess unholy strength, vitality, and power; they don't even leave behind a useful carcass if slain in the Material Plane! Instead, they dissolve into a useless ichor while their spirit scurries back to the Abyss. Imagine the gall of these beings: to lose an honest fight, and then not give up your spoils to the victor! The impropriety!": "恶魔是一群讨厌的人，而且收获起来更加讨厌。撇开它们拥有邪恶的力量、活力和威力这一事实不谈；如果在物质世界中被杀，它们甚至不会留下有用的尸体！相反，它们会化为无用的血清，而它们的灵魂则会逃回深渊。相反，它们会化为无用的血浆，而它们的灵魂则会逃回深渊。想象一下这些生命的胆量：在一场诚实的战斗中失败，然后不把你的战利品交给胜利者！这是不恰当的！这是不恰当的。这是不恰当的!",
	"P.S. Of course, other than that I should mention that using anything harvested from a demon comes with a certain risk of spiritual erosion, eternal damnation, demonic corruption, et cetera.": "P.S.当然，除此之外，我还应该提到，使用从恶魔身上收获的任何东西都有一定的风险，如精神侵蚀、永恒的诅咒、恶魔的腐败等等。",
	"Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.": "由于它们的深渊性质，在物质世界被杀的恶魔不能被收割，因为它们的尸体会溶解成一种恶臭的ichor。这种ichor没有任何作用，实际上是无用的。为了正确地收获恶魔，他们必须在深渊中被杀死。",
	"Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below.": "此外，使用从恶魔身上获得的部件也有一定的风险，因为即使他们死后，他们的腐败影响仍然存在。当玩家消耗或调整由恶魔部件制成的物品时，请掷出（%0%）。如果得到10分或更少，该玩家就会因为使用该物品而受到诅咒。该诅咒在该物品的正常效果结束后仍然存在，并且只有在该玩家被{@spell remove curse}法术或类似魔法锁定时才会被移除。如果一个角色被治愈了由调和物品引起的诅咒，他们就不允许再次尝试调和该物品。DM可以自己挑选诅咒，或者在下面的表格中进行滚动。",
	"If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: \"You have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible.\"": "如果诅咒来自于非消耗品，那么诅咒还有一个额外的方面，即：\"你一直需要接触被诅咒的物品，并且不愿意和它分开。\"你一直需要在被诅咒物品的范围内，并且不愿意和它分开。只要有可能，你就觉得需要装备它。\"",
	"Devils are just as bad as demons in terms of harvesting. To have the nerve of making me go all the way to the Nine Hells just to harvest some devil blood is the height of rudeness. As a small upside, their ichor does make for a wonderful substance with which to tar one's roof.": "在收割方面，魔鬼和恶魔一样糟糕。胆敢让我大老远跑到九层地狱只是为了收获一些魔鬼的血液，这是最无礼的行为。作为一个小小的好处，他们的血清确实是一种很好的物质，可以用来给人的屋顶涂上沥青。",
	"Due to their fiendish nature, devils slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcasses dissolve into a foul ichor or disappear into smoke instead. These serve no purpose and are effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Nine Hells.": "由于其邪恶的本性，在物质界被杀的魔鬼不能被收割，因为它们的尸体会溶入恶臭的汁液或消失在烟雾中。这些东西没有任何作用，实际上是无用的。为了正确地收获恶魔，他们必须在九层地狱被杀。",

Long story short, they're married now (still in their stolen identities) and run a successful inn by the coast.": "我曾经听说过一个有趣的轶事：一个二重身参加了一个聚会，打算勾引被他们盗用身份的那个人的爱侣。他们不知道，那个爱侣也是一个二重身，是来勾引他的。长话短说，他们现在已经结婚了（还是用偷来的身份），在海边经营着一家成功的旅馆。",
	"When a dracolich's spirit enters the corpse of another dragon, it begins a blasphemous process that transforms the corpse into something more suited to the dracolich's dark preferences. Not only is this an affront to all that is natural, it wastes a perfectly good dragon carcass. More than once have I downed a mighty dragon, only to find my assistants were draconic cultists who immediately stole my prize out from under me by lobbing a spirit gem at it. You can only imagine the umbrage I felt not only at now having to fend off an undead dragon, but also losing my chance of having dragon steaks for supper.": "当一条龙的灵魂进入另一条龙的尸体时，它开始了一个亵渎的过程，将尸体转化为更适合龙的黑暗喜好的东西。这不仅是对所有自然的侮辱，而且浪费了一个完美的龙的尸体。我不止一次地击倒了一条强大的龙，却发现我的助手是龙族的崇拜者，他们立即向我扔了一颗精神宝石，把我的奖品偷走了。你可以想象，我现在不仅要抵御一条不死的龙，而且还失去了吃龙肉排的机会，这让我感到很不爽。",
	"Of all the trophies that a hunter can bag, a true dragon tops the list. Physical embodiments of fire, lightning, cold, poison, and acid; all wrapped up in iron-hard scales and gale-force wings. One would be a fool to hunt these creatures alone; to hunt them with friends only marginally less so. But the rewards are great. Almost every part of these magical creatures are useful in some way, whether it be for crafting, spellwork, or just a culinary delight. Still, it is important to note that the older and larger a dragon is, the more valuable the game. The parts of a properly harvested young dragon alone can sell for thousands of gold pieces, but the proceeds from an ancient dragon would put you, your children, and your children's children in comfort for life.": "在所有猎人可以获得的战利品中，真正的龙是最重要的。火焰、闪电、寒冷、毒药和酸液的物理化身；都被包裹在坚硬的鳞片和银河般的翅膀中。独自猎杀这些生物是愚蠢的，与朋友一起猎杀它们则稍逊一筹。但回报是巨大的。这些神奇的生物几乎每一个部分都有一定的用处，不管是用于制作，还是用于施法，或者仅仅是一种烹饪的乐趣。不过，需要注意的是，龙越老越大，游戏的价值就越高。仅仅是一条适当收获的幼龙的部件就可以卖到数千枚金币，但一条古龙的收益可以让你、你的孩子和你的孩子的孩子终生舒适。",
	"Dragons are identified in 4 stages of life: Wyrmling, Young, Adult, and Ancient. The harvesting tables below outline the different types, quantities, and qualities of parts that can be harvested from dragons at different stages of their lives. When noting down the parts harvested, it is important to note which age bracket of the dragon being harvested, as the value of the part and its utility in crafting varies wildly between age groups.": "龙被确定为4个生命阶段。小龙、幼龙、成年龙和古龙。下面的收获表概述了在龙的不同生命阶段可以收获的不同类型、数量和质量的部件。在记下收获的部件时，必须注意被收获的龙的年龄段，因为不同年龄段的部件的价值和在制作中的效用有很大的不同。",
	"The harvesting table does not differentiate between the different colours/metals of the dragon it was harvested from. Instead, [Type] is used as a stand-in. When noting down the harvested part, replace [Type] with the colour/metal of the dragon it was harvested from. This is important, as different dragons are aligned with different damage types and resistances, which will ultimately change the nature of items crafted from that part.": "收获表并不区分它所收获的龙的不同颜色/金属。相反，[类型]被用作替身。当记下收获的部分时，用收获的龙的颜色/金属取代[类型]。这很重要，因为不同的龙有不同的伤害类型和抵抗力，这最终会改变用该部件制作的物品的性质。",
	"Some crafted items will have differing levels of power depending on what age group the dragon it was crafted from belonged in. For example, dragon bone can be crafted into any weapon, but that weapon will have a different bonus depending on the dragon's age: +1 for young, +2 for adult, and +3 for ancient. The crafted item will specify in its description when such a distinction makes a difference.": "一些手工制作的物品会有不同程度的力量，这取决于它所制作的龙属于哪个年龄组。例如，龙骨可以被制作成任何武器，但该武器会根据龙的年龄而有不同的奖励。年轻的+1，成年的+2，而古代的+3。当这种区别造成差异时，制作的物品会在其描述中说明。",

	"You would think that a drider's top half is identical internally to its original drow body, but you would be wrong. In fact, a drider's old drow torso is incredibly mutated to match its new physiology, and no two seem to be alike. Indeed, some driders have been noted to either keep some of their original organs and grow duplicates in their spider halves, or just find their original ones liquefy completely, leaving their torsos as nothing but glorified head-supports.": "你会认为龙骑士的上半身和它原来的乌鸦身体内部是一样的，但你错了。事实上，德鲁伊人的旧躯干会发生令人难以置信的变异，以配合其新的生理结构，而且没有两个似乎是相同的。事实上，有些龙人已经被注意到，要么保留了他们原来的一些器官，并在他们的蜘蛛半身长出了重复的器官，要么就是发现他们原来的器官完全液化了，只剩下他们的躯干作为荣耀的头部支撑。",
	"Usually I hold some hesitation in harvesting humanoids, finding the act more than a little barbaric. The sole exception comes to duergar. As a proud dwarf, it is my duty to not just kill a duergar when I find them, but to also take any loot their carcass may offer": "通常情况下，我对收获人形生物有些犹豫不决，觉得这种行为有点野蛮。唯一的例外是杜尔加人。作为一个骄傲的矮人，我的职责不仅仅是在找到他们时杀死他们，而且还要拿走他们尸体上可能提供的任何战利品。",
	"I have personally faced off against so many drow in my travels that it's a wonder I don't spontaneously transform into a duergar. While their blood is of some use to alchemists, most of their value does come from the items they carry on themselves. Many an elf on the surface would pay a good sum for a drow trinket or two, if only to claim that they themselves were the ones to slay its previous owner.": "在我的旅行中，我曾亲自与这么多的乌鸦对峙，以至于我没有自发地转变为杜尔加人，这真是个奇迹。虽然他们的血对炼金术士有一些用处，但他们的大部分价值来自于他们身上的物品。地表上的许多精灵会花大价钱买一两个鸦人的饰品，如果只是为了宣称他们自己是杀死其前任主人的人。",
	"Personally, I would avoid harvesting an empyrean if for whatever reason you come across its corpse. You don't want their parents to find you walking around with their child's heart as a trinket.": "就个人而言，如果你出于某种原因遇到了帝释天的尸体，我会避免收割它。你不希望他们的父母发现你拿着他们孩子的心脏作为饰品到处走动。",
	"Carrying the remains of an empyrean make you particularly susceptible to the {@spell scrying} attempts of the divine parent of that empyrean.

I hope that whichever god I meet in the ever-after could forgive me for such an act.": "我已经征服了许多生物。在追求写一本全面的指南的过程中，我不得不杀死许多有些人会觉得心痛的东西。我曾将雄伟的麒麟从空中射下，击碎了早熟的小精灵，甚至还击倒了一两个天使。但是，我从来没有感觉到，当我用刀子刺穿一个闯入我的道路的无害小精灵时，我的感觉是那么可怕。我希望不管我在以后遇到的是哪位神，都能原谅我的这种行为。",
	"I will admit, on more than one occasion I have found myself an involuntary servant of a genie noble. It was always a tedious bore to be in one of their courts; stripped of all possessions and forced to entertain them with tales of my travels. My eventual escape never could come soon enough, but alas the joke would be on me as their elemental bodies would inevitably disintegrate upon my vanquishing of them, leaving little behind for me to take home. In the end, I would have to settle for a trinket from one of their vast treasure hoards and call it a day.": "我承认，我不止一次发现自己非自愿地成为一个精灵贵族的仆人。在他们的法庭上总是很乏味；被剥夺了所有的财产，被迫用我的旅行故事来招待他们。我的最终逃亡总是来得不够快，但不幸的是，我的玩笑开大了，因为他们的元素体在我战胜他们时不可避免地会瓦解，几乎没有留下什么东西让我带回家。最后，我不得不从他们巨大的宝藏中选择一个小饰品，然后结束了这一天。",
	"Despite their humanoid appearances, giants are quite different biologically to humanoids, and in fact have more in common with intelligent elementals (such as genies) than with us.

It is theorised by some historians that the legendary fall of the giant kingdoms was a result of the smaller races coveting this power.": "尽管巨人有着人形的外表，但他们在生物学上与人类有很大的不同，事实上，他们与智能元素（如精灵）的共同点要多于我们。虽然巨人的宝藏群通常比他们的个人遗体更有价值，但他们的尸体确实倾向于产生反映其性质的宝贵材料。一些历史学家推测，传说中巨人王国的衰落是小种族觊觎这种力量的结果。",
	"Githyanki are not known for their abstinence, and indeed picking the pockets of a slain warrior or knight can prove to be extraordinarily more profitable and less messy than harvesting their organs. I would advise staying away from their swords however, as those come with a price that few would be willing to pay.": "吉特扬基人并不以禁欲著称，事实上，扒窃被杀的战士或骑士的口袋会被证明是非常有利可图的，而且比摘取他们的器官更不乱。不过，我建议远离他们的剑，因为这些剑的价格很少有人愿意支付。",

	"The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they're dangerous, they're best to be avoided, and they tend to come in threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the dreaded '{@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}.'

	"Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting \"{@disease Crone's Disease|HHHVI}.\" Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become infected with {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}.

On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell {@spell greater restoration} may return the creature to their normal appearance.": "感染后{@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}，受害者的一个面部特征/身体部位立即转变为更像巫婆的样子。例如，他们的鼻子可能变成钩状，或者他们的手变得像爪子。每隔24小时，受害者可以再次尝试拯救动作。如果成功，疾病就会结束，随后每隔24小时，有一个被转化的特征会恢复正常。如果失败，另一个面部特征或身体部位会变得更像巫婆，并且疾病继续。每隔7天，任何当前转化的特征都会变成永久性的，即使在疾病被治愈之后。在这一点上，只有恢复性的魔法，如咒语（%1%），才能使生物恢复到他们的正常外表。",
	"As much as I despise their goblin cousins, I do offer hobgoblins a modicum of respect. I find no issue at all with taking a trophy or two from the carcass of one that I have slain, as I have no doubt the fellow would have done the same to me had things turned out differently.": "尽管我很鄙视他们的地精表亲，但我还是对地精有一定的尊重。我觉得从被我杀死的妖精的尸体上拿一两件战利品完全没有问题，因为我毫不怀疑，如果事情的结果不同，这个家伙也会对我做同样的事情。",
	"I have never been fond of birds, and I find talking, thieving birds to be even worse. I once recall waking from a particularly raucous night of revelry, only to find myself covered by street-kenku, looting me like a freshly slain kill. They ran as soon as I raised my fist at them of course, but by then, they had already taken everything off me, including my clothes. Needless to say, it was a rather awkward journey back to my lodgings that morning.": "我从来都不喜欢鸟类，我发现会说话、会偷东西的鸟类更可怕。我记得有一次从一个特别喧闹的狂欢之夜醒来，却发现自己被街头的Kenku所覆盖，像一个刚被杀死的猎物一样抢夺我。当然，我一举起拳头他们就跑了，但那时他们已经拿走了我身上的所有东西，包括我的衣服。不用说，那天早上回到我的住处是一段相当尴尬的旅程。",
	"It is believed by some scholars that kobolds are actually the ancestor race of the dragons from eons ago. Not many air these theories publicly though, seeing as how the last one that did, came home to their study one day to find it burned to cinders.": "一些学者认为，哥布林实际上是很久以前的龙的祖先种族。不过没有多少人公开宣扬这些理论，因为最后一个宣扬这些理论的人有一天回到家发现他们的书房被烧成了焦炭。",
	"Be wary when harvesting a kuo-toa; their insides smell stronger of rotten fish than their outsides. If you do find your hands stained with their horrid stench after harvesting them, a good tip is to soak them in the nearby ocean for a while. For whatever reason, doing so seems to nullify the worst effects of it, but you may still be followed by seagulls for a while afters.": "收获国土鳖时要小心；它们的内部比外部更有腐烂鱼的味道。如果你发现你的手在收获后沾上了它们的可怕臭味，一个好的建议是将它们在附近的海里浸泡一段时间。不管是什么原因，这样做似乎可以消除其最坏的影响，但之后你可能仍然会被海鸥跟踪一段时间。",
	"Liches, are base and cowardly beings, not to mention extremely hypocritical. After all, there is no better path to immortality than as a trophy on my wall, but instead liches simply dissolve into dust upon their deaths, leaving me nothing to work with!": "地衣，是卑贱而懦弱的生命，更不用说是极其虚伪的。毕竟，没有比作为我墙上的战利品更好的不朽之路，但相反，地衣在死后只是化为尘土，没有给我留下任何可利用的东西！\"。",
	"For some reason, lizardfolk-skin bags and shoes have never caught on as a fashion item in any society that I have visited. It's odd, seeing as how there is no functional difference between the skin of a crocodile and that of a lizardfolk. Perhaps people are just a tad squeamish about wearing the skin of something that can talk.": "出于某种原因，在我访问过的任何社会中，蜥蜴皮的包和鞋都没有作为一种时尚物品流行起来。这很奇怪，因为鳄鱼皮和蜥蜴皮在功能上没有任何区别。也许人们只是对穿着会说话的东西的皮有点胆怯。",
	"As a whole, I do not make a sport of hunting lycanthropes. Even though their beastly nature would make them fair game, they revert to their original form upon death, and as a whole I tend to avoid hunting and harvesting humanoids (for both ethical and legal reasons).": "作为一个整体，我不以猎杀狼人为乐。尽管他们的兽性会使他们成为公平的猎物，但他们死后会恢复到原来的形态，而且作为一个整体，我倾向于避免猎杀和收获人形生物（出于道德和法律的原因）。",
	"A lycanthrope reverts to its true form when it dies, and as such, it should be treated as a member of its original species when harvested. The only exception is in harvesting its blood, which is changed irrevocably due to the curse.": "狼人死后会恢复到它的真实形态，因此，在收获时应被视为其原始物种的成员。唯一的例外是在收获它的血液时，由于诅咒的存在，它的血液会被不可逆转地改变。",
	"Medusas are interesting creatures to harvest for several reasons. The first is that it is quite difficult to harvest something you are not allowed to look at directly, as the medusa's petrifying gaze persists even after its death. The second, is that their granite-like composition means that a medusa's body does not decompose the way a normal creature would. As such, a freshly harvested medusa head can remain recognisable (and thus usable) for many years.": "美杜莎是一种有趣的收获生物，有几个原因。第一个原因是，要收获一个你不允许直接看的东西是相当困难的，因为美杜莎的石化目光甚至在它死后仍然存在。第二，它们的花岗岩般的成分意味着美杜莎的身体不会像普通生物那样被分解。因此，一个新收获的美杜莎头颅可以在许多年内保持可识别性（并因此可用）。",
	"Due to the fact that a medusa's petrifying gaze remains active even beyond the death of the medusa, any character attempting to harvest the medusa must do so while averting their gaze. Doing so imposes disadvantage on any check made to harvest the medusa, unless that character is capable of another reliable method of {@skill perception}.": "由于冥王星的石化凝视即使在冥王星死亡后仍然有效，任何试图收割冥王星的角色都必须在移开目光的情况下进行。这样做会对任何收割冥王星的检查造成不利，除非该角色有其他可靠的方法（%0%）。",
	"Before they were widely known, tales of merfolk and their wondrous anatomies circulated across the land, often buoyed by \"harvested skeletal remains\" of the creatures. In actual fact, most of these were simply normal human skeletons with shark or dolphin tail bones attached, sold by unscrupulous sailors to make a quick coin.": "在他们广为人知之前，关于人鱼族和他们奇妙的解剖学的故事在各地流传，往往以 \"收获的骨骼 \"来支撑这些生物。事实上，这些遗骸大多是普通人的骨骼，上面附着鲨鱼或海豚的尾巴，由无良水手出售，以赚取快钱。",
	"To be honest, I'm not entirely sure modrons deserve to be in this book. Not only are constructs already a grey area when it comes to the definition of \"\"harvesting,\" modrons also dissolve into a useless dust upon death. Better to take them to a clockmaker than a proper harvester.": "说实话，我并不完全确定莫德隆应该出现在这本书里。不仅当涉及到\"\"收获 \"的定义时，构造物已经是一个灰色地带，而且模子在死亡时也会溶解成无用的灰尘。把它们带到钟表匠那里比带到一个合适的收割者那里更好。",
	"Modrons dissolve into a useless dust upon death and as such, do not feature a harvest table.": "Modrons在死亡后会化为无用的尘埃，因此，没有收获表。",
	"Oozes are a staple of any good adventure experience, and every good adventurer should know how to repurpose the nasty things for their own uses. Best to exercise caution when harvesting them however, as their slime remains active even after the animating force behind them is gone.": "渗水虫是任何好的冒险经历的主食，每个好的冒险者都应该知道如何将这些讨厌的东西重新用于自己的用途。然而，在收获它们时最好小心谨慎，因为它们的粘液即使在它们背后的动力消失后仍然保持活性。",
	"If you fail on an attempt to harvest any item from an ooze, you suffer half the acid damage associated with that oozes pseudopod ability as you spill the slime over yourself by accident.": "如果你试图从渗水体收获任何物品时失败，你会受到与该渗水体假肢能力相关的一半酸液伤害，因为你意外地将粘液洒在自己身上。",
	"As much as it pains me to admit this, I owe some of my sizeable knowledge to the orcs. Although they seem barbaric and savage to us civilised folk, orcs are extraordinarily good hunters and harvesters. Generations spent roving the land has taught them how to harvest just about anything, and I have learned some of my more esoteric techniques while observing their methods.": "虽然我很不愿意承认这一点，但我的一些重要的知识要归功于兽人。虽然在我们这些文明人看来，他们是野蛮人，但兽人是特别好的猎人和收割者。世世代代在这片土地上游荡，让他们学会了如何收获几乎所有的东西，而我在观察他们的方法时学到了一些更深奥的技术。",
	"I once met a man that collected pixies the way that other men collect butterflies. Needless to say, he was a tad unstable, but some of the research he did was used to write this entry, so it would be rather ungrateful of me to criticise him too harshly.": "我曾经遇到过一个收集小精灵的人，就像其他男人收集蝴蝶一样。不用说，他的情绪有点不稳定，但他所做的一些研究被用来写这篇文章，所以如果我过于严厉地批评他，那就太不厚道了。",
	"I got on the wrong side of a rakshasa once. Blasted thing kept hounding me every so often, no matter how many times I drove my hunting knife through its skull. Eventually I had to charter an expedition into the Infernal Plane just to get him off my back. To his credit, his back now adorns my parlour floor as a rather fetching rug, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.": "我曾经和一个罗刹打过交道。这该死的东西每隔一段时间就缠着我不放，不管我用猎刀刺穿它的头骨多少次。最后，我不得不包下一个远征军，进入无间界，只是为了让他离开我的背。值得称道的是，他的背现在成了我客厅地板上的一块相当漂亮的地毯，所以这并不是完全在浪费时间。",
	"I once had a fishing trip ruined by a run in with a sahuagin. I had just landed a massive bass that I was eager to mount on my wall and turned around for a single moment to gather my cleaning supplies. When I turned back however, my prize was gone and replaced by one rather gluttonous sahuagin. I won't go into the details, but needless to say I ended up mounting something on my wall that day": "有一次，我的一次钓鱼之旅因与萨瓦金人的冲突而被毁。当时我刚刚钓到一条巨大的鲈鱼，我急于把它挂在墙上，于是转身去收拾我的清洁用品，只用了一会儿。然而，当我回头时，我的战利品已经不见了，取而代之的是一只相当贪吃的萨瓦金。我就不说细节了，但不用说，那天我最终在墙上挂上了一些东西。",
	"Some scholars have attempted to study the lightning birth of shambling mounds, believing that their incredible regeneration and growth abilities may be used to increase food production several times. Unfortunately, so far the only results of their experiments have been electrified fields and irate farmers.": "一些学者试图研究闪电式土丘的闪电诞生，认为它们令人难以置信的再生和生长能力可能被用来增加粮食产量数倍。不幸的是，到目前为止，他们实验的唯一结果是通电的田地和愤怒的农民。",
	"Due to their large sizes and amorphous nature, a shambling mound can potentially be harvested several times. If you successfully harvest the \"shambling mound mulch\" or the \"shambling mound vine\" items, you may attempt to harvest them again, with the DC raising by 2 for each attempt. You may repeatedly attempt to harvest either of these items until the first time you fail on your harvesting check for them.": "由于其巨大的尺寸和无定形的性质，一个晃动土丘有可能被收割几次。如果你成功地收割了 \"乱石堆地膜 \"或 \"乱石堆藤蔓\"，你可以再次尝试收割它们，每次尝试的DC都会增加2。你可以反复尝试收割这些物品，直到你第一次对它们进行收割检查失败。",
	"So powerful is the tarrasque; so awe inspiring, devastating, and unstoppable, that every single part of it has entered the lore of one culture or another. The tarrasque is in fact one of the few creatures in this Multiverse that I cannot boast about killing, and in truth, even I would not attempt to. The entries here on tarrasque parts are based purely on legends I have heard on my travels; ancient cultures that have inherited stories from even more ancient cultures. I shudder to know of which prehistoric society ever managed to fell a tarrasque and harvest it for their own use, and I shudder even more to know what force managed to wipe that society from the history books.": "塔拉斯克是如此强大；如此令人敬畏、具有破坏性和不可阻挡，以至于它的每一个部分都进入了这种或那种文化的传说中。事实上，塔拉斯克是这个多元宇宙中为数不多的、我无法夸耀自己能杀死的生物之一，而且事实上，即使是我也不会尝试这样做。这里关于塔拉斯克部分的条目纯粹是基于我在旅行中听到的传说；这些古老的文化从更古老的文化中继承了故事。我不知道哪一个史前社会曾经成功地摔倒过塔拉斯克，并将其收为己用，我更不知道是什么力量将这个社会从历史书上抹去。",
	"The tarrasque is so large that it cannot be easily harvested by any single adventurer, or indeed even a group of adventurers. The harvesting of a tarrasque for usable parts is an endeavour that would require a full company of workers a long period of time to complete, and that's before the time it takes to ship everything back and then make the parts usable.": "龙卷风是如此之大，以至于任何一个冒险家，甚至是一群冒险家都无法轻易收获它。收割塔拉斯克的可用部件是一项需要一个完整的工人团队长时间才能完成的工作，而且这还不包括将所有东西运回，然后使部件可用的时间。",
	"The harvesting of a tarrasque takes 10 labourers proficient in harvesting a total of 30 days to complete (assuming that they work for 8 hours a day). Every 6 days, the labourers successfully manage to harvest 1 of the items on the {@table tarrasque|HHHVI|tarrasque's harvest table}. Due to the irregular method of harvesting a tarrasque, no check is made when attempting to do so, the labourers must simply put in enough work to finish the job.": "收割一个塔拉斯克需要10个精通收割的劳动者共30天完成（假设他们每天工作8小时）。每隔6天，劳动者就能成功地收获其中的一个项目（%0%）。由于收割塔拉斯克的方法不固定，在尝试收割时不需要检查，劳动者必须简单地投入足够的工作来完成这项工作。",

	"I have never been a fan of tussling with vampires. Creatures of the night, they rarely present an honest fight, not to mention the annoying fact that most items harvested from their long-overdue corpses whisper temptations to those that possess them. When I go monster hunting, I am looking for trophies, not gossipy boarders.": "我一直不喜欢和吸血鬼打交道。黑夜中的生物，他们很少有诚实的战斗，更不用说从他们久违的尸体上收获的大多数物品对拥有它们的人来说都是令人讨厌的诱惑。当我去猎杀怪物时，我正在寻找战利品，而不是八卦的寄宿者。",
	"Items crafted or taken from a vampire carry with them a dark undead energy that makes using them a risky proposition. Anytime a creature attuned to an item made from a vampire part attempts a long rest, there is a {@chance 90|10 percent chance|Gravemaster's Curse|You are not cursed.|You are cursed.} that they will be afflicted with the {@i Gravemaster's Curse}. At the DM's discretion, this roll may be made in secret, with the result unknown to the relevant player.": "从吸血鬼身上制作或取得的物品带有黑暗的亡灵能量，这使得使用它们成为一个危险的提议。任何时候，当一个与由吸血鬼部件制成的物品相适应的生物试图进行长时间的休息时，他们有百分之0的可能会受到百分之1的影响。在DM的决定下，这个卷轴可以秘密进行，其结果不为相关玩家所知。",
	"A creature cursed in this way can't voluntarily end their attunement to the item that cursed them, and they feel a need to be within arm's length of that item at all times. Whenever the cursed creature sleeps, they hear whispers of temptation from the vampire from whom the cursed item was made but forgets it as soon as they awaken. A cursed creature is not necessarily aware they have been cursed. After 7 consecutive days of being cursed, a cursed creature will take any opportunity to be alone and to get away from anybody that would be able to identify and remove the curse.": "以这种方式被诅咒的生物不能主动结束与诅咒他们的物品的联系，而且他们感到有必要随时与该物品保持距离。每当被诅咒的生物睡觉时，他们会听到被诅咒物品的吸血鬼发出的诱惑的低语，但他们一醒来就会忘记。被诅咒的生物不一定知道他们已经被诅咒了。在连续7天被诅咒后，被诅咒的生物会利用任何机会独处，远离任何能够识别和消除诅咒的人。",
	"If a creature remains cursed by this item for the continuous length of one full lunar cycle, they are possessed by the soul of the vampire from whom the item that cursed them was created. When this happens, the creature is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of their body which also transforms into a full vampire. The possessing vampire spirit retains all of their old memories, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any spellcasting abilities it may have had. It otherwise adopts the possessed target's statistics, as well as any of their knowledge, class features, and proficiencies. The returned vampire also retains attunement to any items the original possessed target had, including the item that cursed them in the first place.": "如果一个生物被这个物品连续诅咒了一个完整的月球周期，他们就会被吸血鬼的灵魂附身，而诅咒他们的物品就是从这个吸血鬼身上产生的。当这种情况发生时，该生物会被（%0%）并失去对他们身体的控制，同时也会变成一个完整的吸血鬼。附身的吸血鬼灵魂保留了他们所有的旧记忆、智力、智慧和魅力分数，以及任何可能拥有的法术能力。除此之外，它还采用被附身的目标的统计数据，以及他们的任何知识、类别特征和能力。回归的吸血鬼也保留了对原来被附身的目标的任何物品的适应性，包括一开始就诅咒他们的物品。",
	"The original soul of the possessed body is then imprisoned inside the item that cursed them. While imprisoned in this way, the original soul is aware of its immediate surroundings and can communicate telepathically with any creature in contact with them and vice versa. If the item is ever destroyed, the possessed soul is destroyed as well. The only way to lift the curse and restore the soul to its body is with either a {@spell wish} spell, or if the possessing vampire breaks their attunement to the cursing item. If the curse is lifted in this way, the soul of the vampire is destroyed permanently and the original soul retakes control of their body. If the original body is destroyed, the original soul is sent to the afterlife.": "被附身者的原始灵魂会被囚禁在诅咒他们的物品内。在以这种方式被囚禁时，原来的灵魂能意识到它周围的环境，并能与任何与他们接触的生物进行心灵感应，反之亦然。如果该物品被摧毁，被附身的灵魂也会被摧毁。唯一能解除诅咒并使灵魂回归其身体的方法是使用{@spell wish}的咒语，或者如果拥有的吸血鬼打破了他们与诅咒物品的联系。如果诅咒以这种方式被解除，吸血鬼的灵魂就会被永久地摧毁，原来的灵魂就会重新控制他们的身体。如果原来的身体被摧毁，原来的灵魂就会被送入来世。",
	"Only one item made from a vampire can curse a target at any given time and a creature may only be cursed by one vampire's item at a time.

	"Unlike most fiends, the ichor that a yugoloth leaves behind actually serves some purpose. As befitting their greedy natures, some lower-tier yugoloths have actually made a business of allowing themselves to be slain and their ichor collected.": "与大多数魔族不同，尤戈洛人留下的ichor实际上有一些用途。与他们贪婪的本性相称，一些低级别的尤格罗人实际上已经把允许自己被杀和收集他们的ichor作为一项业务。",
	"Like regular devils, yugoloths slain outside of their native plane also dissolve into an ichor rather than leave behind a corpse. Given the yugoloths artificial nature however, this ichor tends to be more useful than devil ichor and can be harvested for some benefit. Either way, a yugoloth slain outside of Gehenna cannot be harvested for anything except their respective ichor. Yugoloths slain on Gehenna can be harvested like a regular creature, including their ichor, traces of which can still be found in their veins.": "像普通的魔鬼一样，在他们的本位面之外被杀的尤戈洛人也会溶入一种ichor，而不是留下一具尸体。然而，鉴于尤戈洛人的人工性质，这种ichor往往比魔鬼的ichor更有用，可以收获一些好处。不管怎么说，在地府之外被杀的尤格罗人，除了他们各自的ichor之外，不能收获任何东西。在Gehenna上被杀的尤格罗人可以像普通生物一样被收割，包括他们的ichor，在他们的血管中仍然可以找到痕迹。",
	"As zombie is more of a classification than a creature, it is difficult to say exactly what items may be harvested from them, except for the universal putrid fluids that flows through their veins.": "由于僵尸更像是一种分类，而不是一种生物，因此很难说从他们身上到底可以收获什么物品，除了流经他们血管的普遍腐烂的液体。",
	"It was our long distant ancestors that first discovered how to transform the bones of a fresh kill into a heavy club with which to make more fresh kills. Today of course, we have the wonders of civilisation, and with that comes a litany of more advanced tools, weapons, armor, and equipment to be made from what we kill. Indeed, the resourcefulness of society means that just about every creature's carcass can serve as more than just a trophy if you take it to someone with the right know-how.": "是我们遥远的祖先首先发现了如何将新鲜杀戮的骨头转化为沉重的棍棒，用来制造更多的新鲜杀戮。当然，今天我们有了文明的奇迹，随之而来的是一连串更先进的工具、武器、盔甲和设备，可以用我们杀的东西来制作。事实上，社会的足智多谋意味着几乎所有生物的尸体都可以作为战利品，如果你把它拿给有正确技能的人的话，就不仅仅是一个战利品。",
	"While some creature parts are useful fresh from the carcass, many require some alterations before their full potential can be realised. These items can be identified due to having a {@b craftable item} listed in their crafting column.

	"Both player characters and NPCs may act as crafters, so long as they fulfil the stipulated requirements for their crafter type.": "玩家角色和NPC都可以充当工匠，只要他们满足其工匠类型的规定要求。",
	"Crafters also need to have the right equipment and tools in order to craft an item, however that aspect is left up to the discretion of the DM and the suitability of the setting. In more fantastical campaigns, magical forges and laboratories may line every city bazaar, while in more grounded settings, finding appropriate facilities may be a quest in and of itself.": "工匠们还需要有合适的设备和工具来制作物品，不过这方面要由DM来决定，也要考虑环境的适宜性。在更多的幻想活动中，魔法锻造厂和实验室可能会在每个城市的集市上出现，而在更接地气的环境中，寻找适当的设施可能本身就是一种追求。",
	"Each craftable item listed in this guide requires at least one harvestable material from a monster's harvesting table to act as a {@b base component} of the item.

While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plant life.": "任何森林居民都知道，枯萎病具有迅速传播其影响的能力。它们通过每一种枯萎病携带的许多种子来实现这一目标。这些干燥的、有皱纹的种子在几个小时内就会发芽，并在几天内生长成熟，形成臭名昭著的藤蔓、荆棘和枯萎病侵袭的杂草。虽然如果不是由真正的枯萎病种植，它们的大部分黑暗属性都会消失，但一些炼金术士能够将它们重新用于作物肥料或与植物生命发生奇怪反应的油。",

	"Lemure Essence": "Lemure精华",
	"The blobbish, fetid body of the lemure is useful for little in both life and in death. Their essence on the other hand is much more useful, as it serves as the currency of the Nine Hells (due to price fluctuations, the value of an individual lemure soul may differ depending on the time of reading). As the lemure technically belongs to the devil who corrupted its original soul in the first place, do beware when harvesting these as there may be a devil who is less than pleased about being robbed.": "莱姆人那臃肿、腥臭的身体在生前和死后都没什么用处。另一方面，他们的精髓则更为有用，因为它是九层地狱的货币（由于价格波动，单个莱姆人灵魂的价值可能因阅读时间不同而不同）。由于莱姆在技术上属于首先腐蚀其原始灵魂的魔鬼，因此在收获这些莱姆时要小心，因为可能有一个魔鬼对被抢劫不大高兴。",

	"Pit Fiend Head": "坑道恶魔头",
	"A pit fiend is one of the most terrifying beings in the entire multiverse.

If forged into a suit of armor, it can make even the bulkiest of knights disappear when in darkness.": "影龙的鳞片是一种奇怪的颜色，只能被描述为黄昏时的影子的颜色。尽管它们有空灵的外表，然而它们保持着惊人的耐久性和强度。如果将其锻造成一套盔甲，在黑暗中甚至可以使最笨重的骑士消失。",

	"The ever shifting wings of the shadow dragon make it appear more like a dark cloud when it swoops upon its prey. They are more fragile than regular dragon wings and require great care when harvested, however these same special properties make them invaluable when crafting implements of flight and stealth.": "影龙不断变化的翅膀使它在扑向猎物时显得更像一片乌云。它们比普通的龙翼更脆弱，收获时需要非常小心，然而这些特殊的属性使它们在制作飞行和隐身工具时具有无价之宝。",

	"Poison": "毒药",
	"Dragon Flesh": "龙肉",
	"Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits.

There are many royal cooks and larders that would pay a high sum for just a pound of this delicacy.": "尽管普遍存在误解，但龙肉并不包含任何神奇的好处。然而，它确实含有许多烹饪的好处。确切的味道因龙的类型而异，但任何吃过龙肉的人都声称，它甚至让最精致的陈年牛肉都感到羞愧。有许多皇家厨师和储藏室愿意花高价购买一磅这种美味。",
	"[Type] Dragon Blood (9 vials)": "[类型] 龙血 (9瓶)",
	"The blood of an ancient dragon is one of the most powerful spell reagents and potion ingredients in existence. Even besides its use in the birth of half-dragon soldiers and other rituals, the most common use of potent dragon blood is to make a potion that can imbue the drinker with the same strengths as the dragon it was taken from.": "古龙的血是现存最强大的法术试剂和药水成分之一。除了用于半龙人士兵的诞生和其他仪式外，强效龙血最常见的用途是制作一种药水，可以赋予饮用者与取自龙的相同力量。",
	"[Type] Dragon Tooth (×15)": "[类型] 龙牙 (×15)",
	"The teeth of a full grown ancient dragon have been the end of many a hapless adventurer.

	"The bones of a dragon are as hard and durable as the rest of their body. Not many weaponsmiths know how to reshape dragon bone, and those that do, keep it a guarded secret (most likely to avoid the ire of paranoid dragons). However, there is a good reason that myths and legends of heroes carrying dragonbone weapons abound in every culture: anyone who has seen one will agree that they simply have no equal.": "龙的骨头和它们身体的其他部分一样坚硬耐用。没有多少武器制造商知道如何重塑龙骨，而那些知道的人则将其作为一个保守的秘密（很可能是为了避免被偏执的龙所激怒）。然而，有一个很好的理由，每一种文化中都有英雄携带龙骨武器的神话和传说：任何见过龙骨武器的人都会同意，它们根本无法与之相比。",
	"[Type] Dragon Horn/Spine": "[类型]龙角/脊柱",

	"The notoriously hard scales of an ancient dragon. Harder than steel yet surprisingly light, it is the dream of every armor-smith to craft a suit from this legendary material.

	"[Type] Dragon Breath Pouch": "[类型]龙息袋",
	"When the word \"dragon\" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces.

Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction.": "说起 \"龙 \"这个词，人们往往会想到三样东西：翅膀、鳞片和呼吸。在龙的喉咙后面有一个篮子大小的袋子，装着龙自然产生的神奇液体。虽然这些液体和它们所产生的呼气因龙而异，但它们都有相同的破坏性结果。在不破坏它们的情况下收获其中一种，几乎和一开始杀死它的主人一样困难，但其结果是一个浓缩的毁灭袋。",

	"The wings of a dragon defy any sense of natural law. Even considering their own immense size, they could not possibly lift a form as massive as the ancient dragon they bear, and yet they do. Only a magical force, inherent in their leathery membranes, could make such flight possible. Cloaks fashioned from these membranes can provide similar propulsion to other creatures, along with providing a stylistic fashion choice.": "龙的翅膀违背了任何自然法则的意义。即使考虑到它们自己巨大的尺寸，它们也不可能举起像它们所承载的古龙那样巨大的形体，但它们却做到了。只有一种神奇的力量，在它们的皮膜中固有的，才能使这种飞行成为可能。由这些皮膜制成的斗篷可以为其他生物提供类似的推进力，同时也提供了一种时尚风格的选择。",

	"Whether they were good or evil, a dragon is a akin to a force of nature and possessing the heart of an ancient dragon is no small matter (even ignoring the fact that it is the size of a large dwarf).

	"Steam Ventral": "蒸汽中心",
	"A basket sized organ located alongside the lungs. When the dragon turtle inhales water, some is stored inside this organ, where it reacts with enzymes that rapidly accelerate heating. While it appears nominally that this organ is meant to provide the dragon turtle with warmth during its deep sea dives, it doubles as a defense mechanism, allowing the dragon turtle to spit jets of scalding steam from its mouth. When harvested, it maintains this property, but lacks both the muscular support for long ranges and the ability to refill on enzymes, giving it a short shelf life.": "一个篮子大小的器官，位于肺的旁边。当龙龟吸入水时，一些水被储存在这个器官内，在那里与酶反应，迅速加速加热。虽然从名义上看，这个器官是为了在龙龟深海潜水时提供温暖，但它同时也是一种防御机制，使龙龟能够从口中吐出滚烫的蒸汽喷射器。当收获时，它保持了这一特性，但缺乏长距离的肌肉支持和补充酶的能力，使其保质期很短。",
	"As an action, a creature may squeeze the steam ventral to release a 30-foot cone of scalding steam. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 15d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage. This ability can only be used within 48 hours of the dragon turtle's death. Once used, the steam ventral is emptied out and rendered useless.": "作为一个动作，一个生物可以挤压蒸汽腹板，释放出一个30英尺的灼热蒸汽锥体。该区域内的每个生物都必须做一个{@dc 18}体质判定，如果判定失败，将受到{@damage 15d6}的火焰伤害，如果判定成功，将受到一半的伤害。身处水下并不能对这种伤害产生抵抗。这种能力只能在龙龟死亡后48小时内使用。一旦使用，蒸汽腹腔就会被清空，变得毫无用处。",
	"Dragon Turtle Shell Shard": "龙龟壳碎片",
	"Almost thicker than the scales of an ancient dragon, the shell of a dragon turtle is able to deflect almost anything the sea can throw at it. Although it can be difficult to find one that is suitable, a shard of a dragon turtle's shell can make for one of the finest shields known outside of legends.": "龙龟的壳几乎比古龙的鳞片还要厚，它能够抵挡大海中的任何东西。虽然很难找到合适的龙龟，但龙龟壳的碎片可以成为传说之外最好的盾牌之一。",
	"Drider Oil (4 vials)": "德瑞德油（4小瓶）",
	"Anybody who has observed a spider will notice that they do not stick to their own webs, and a drider is no exception. For the drider, this comes in the form of a gland that secretes an oily substance that covers the almost invisible hairs on their legs. This oil prevents them from sticking to any sort of webbing and also contributes to the black sheen on their bodies.": "任何观察过蜘蛛的人都会注意到，它们不会粘在自己的网上，德雷特也不例外。对于钻头蜘蛛来说，它的腺体会分泌一种油性物质，覆盖在它们腿上几乎看不见的毛发上。这种油可以防止它们粘在任何类型的网上，也有助于它们身体上的黑色光泽。",

	"Unbeknownst to many is that each drider is marked by more than just the physical transformation of their lower body into that of a giant spider. Each drider also receives a permanent mark in the shape of the symbol of {@deity Lolth|drow|MTF}. The issue is that the location of this mark changes with each individual drider, so a thorough investigation of the carcass is required to find it. Once that is done however, the mark provides uses in channelling certain powers from the drow goddess, even against her own will.": "许多人不知道的是，每个龙骑士的标记不仅仅是他们的下半身变成一只巨大的蜘蛛的物理变化。每一个龙骑士都会收到一个永久的标记，其形状为（%0%）的符号。问题是，这个标记的位置会随着每一个人的变化而变化，所以需要对尸体进行彻底的调查才能找到它。然而，一旦找到了，这个标记就能提供从乌鸦女神那里获取某些力量的用途，甚至是违背她自己的意愿。",
	"Dryad Hair": "干枯的头发",
	"Hair is used as a loose term, as the material covering a dryad's head more resembles loose foliage and vines than actual hair. Still, it is beautiful to behold and surprisingly strong. More ostentatious adventurers use the hair as rope to commemorate their conquest of a dryad...in either sense of the term.": "头发被用作一个宽松的术语，因为覆盖干尸头部的材料更像松散的树叶和藤蔓，而不是真正的头发。尽管如此，它仍然是美丽的，而且令人惊讶的强大。更加炫耀的冒险家用头发作为绳子来纪念他们对干尸的征服......无论是哪种意义上的征服。",

	"Dryad Eye (×2)": "乾坤眼 (×2)",
	"Many who have wandered through the forest at night can attest to seeing two orbs of silver or gold, dancing through the tree branches, and beckoning them to join them.

The eyes maintain these properties even after the dryad is killed and their eyes transfigured into useful equipment for adventurers.": "许多在夜间漫步于森林的人都能证明看到两个银色或金色的眼球，在树枝上跳舞，并召唤他们加入。这通常是干尸的眼睛，没有多少生物能够凝视它们而不被迷住。即使干尸被杀，他们的眼睛也会保持这些特性，并被转化为冒险者的有用装备。",

Alternatively, it can just be lobbed at a foe to make a sticky explosion.": "像真正的蜘蛛一样，ettercap能够从其腹部的腺体中发出网络。一旦从宿主身上取下，腺体就会相当脆弱，但其中所含的丝被认为是制作绳索和其他物品的材料。另外，它也可以直接扔给敌人，使其产生粘性爆炸。",
	"As an action, you may throw the web gland up to 15 feet. Upon impact with the ground, the web gland explodes, forcing all creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a {@dc 11} Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by webbing. As an action, the {@condition restrained} creature can make a {@dc 11} Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "作为一个动作，你可以将网状腺体扔到15英尺以外。撞击地面后，网状腺体会爆炸，迫使5英尺内的所有生物做一个{@dc 11}的灵巧救赎动作，否则就会被网住。作为一个动作，{@condition restrained}的生物可以做一个{@dc 11}的力量检查，如果成功就可以从网状物中逃脱。如果网带被破坏，则效果结束。网状物有10点攻击力，5点命中率，对重击伤害有抵抗力，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。",
	"Ettin Fingernail": "艾汀手指甲",
	"Like other giants, the fingernail sliver of an ettin is a key ingredient in the brewing of a {@item potion of giant strength|DMG}, in this case, acting as a stand in for a hill giant's. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.": "和其他巨人一样，艾丁的指甲片是酿制{@item potion of giant strength|DMG}的关键成分，在这种情况下，它可以作为山丘巨人的替身。尽管冒险者们误以为砍倒一个巨人就能为他们提供终身的药水，但每个巨人只能酿制一种药水。这是因为炼金术过程中使用指甲作为导引点来召唤那个特定巨人的力量，从而使任何其他的尝试都失去了意义。",
	"Ettin Head (×2)": "艾丁头 (×2)",
	"Though ettins are often witnessed physically talking to their twinned head, their unique physiology causes their brains to share information subconsciously; a trait that can be exploited through clever artificing. Indeed, it is probably ironic that despite being among the dumbest beings on the Material Plane, ettins are capable of mental techniques that elude even the most prestigious of minds.": "虽然人们经常看到埃廷人与他们的双胞胎头颅交谈，但他们独特的生理结构使他们的大脑在潜意识中分享信息；这种特性可以通过巧妙的人工制造来利用。事实上，具有讽刺意味的是，尽管他们是物质世界中最愚蠢的生物之一，但埃廷斯却能够掌握连最有声望的人都无法理解的心理技术。",

	"Hydra Heart Piece": "九头蛇心形片",

	"It takes 10 minutes to consume enough hydra heart to have an effect. Once consumed, you regain all hit points as well as regrow any missing body parts. If a body part is regrown in this way, you feel an intense feeling of hunger and suffer 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} until you consume at least 5 pounds of food. The hydra heart must be consumed within 24 hours upon the death of the hydra, otherwise it gives no effect.": "需要10分钟才能消耗足够的九头蛇心脏来产生效果。一旦消耗，你会恢复所有的命中率，以及重新长出任何缺失的身体部位。如果身体部位以这种方式重新生长，你会感到强烈的饥饿感，并遭受1级（%0%）的饥饿感，直到你消耗至少5磅的食物。九头蛇的心脏必须在九头蛇死亡后的24小时内食用，否则就没有效果。",

On a success, you learn the identity of who this intellect devourer used to be, as well as one key memory. The key memory is up to the discretion of the DM, but may be something that the intellect devourer knew in its original life, or something it has learned after becoming an intellect devourer.": "作为一项行动，你可以喝下一小瓶脑液。如果你这样做，你必须做一个{@dc 12}智力测验。如果失败，你会在1分钟内变得（%1%），因为你的大脑无法处理通过它涌入的信息。如果成功，你就会知道这个智力吞噬者以前的身份，以及一个关键的记忆。关键记忆由DM决定，但可以是智力吞噬者在原来的生活中知道的东西，也可以是它成为智力吞噬者后学到的东西。",
	"Living Brainstem": "活的脑干",
	"Living is a strong word in this case. Used here, it really means that the brain still has some capacity for interaction and response to stimuli, due largely to the dark rituals used to transform it into an intellect devourer.

	"For 6 hours after an intellect devourer's death, its main brain continues to send weak signals of psionic wavelengths. When the brain is worn directly on top of a humanoid's head, that humanoid becomes immune to the detect sentience ability of intellect devourers. Instead, an intellect devourer that detects that humanoid will assume that humanoid is a host of a living intellect devourer and will treat them accordingly. However, an intellect devourer that can see without using its {@sense blindsight} will still notice that a humanoid is wearing a brain on the top of their head and will also react accordingly.": "在智力吞噬者死亡后的6个小时内，它的主脑会继续发送微弱的幻觉波长信号。当大脑被直接戴在一个人形生物的头顶上时，这个人形生物会对智力吞噬者的探测能力产生免疫。相反，检测到该类人的智力吞噬者会认为该类人是一个活的智力吞噬者的宿主，并会相应地对待他们。然而，一个不使用（%0%）就能看到的智力吞噬者仍然会注意到一个人形生物在他们的头顶上戴着一个大脑，也会做出相应的反应。",
