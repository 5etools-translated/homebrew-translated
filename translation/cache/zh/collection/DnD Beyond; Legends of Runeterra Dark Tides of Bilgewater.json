	"This is a world of champions and monsters, of nations rising and falling in wars of conquest and magic. The many lands of Runeterra are bursting with adventures of all kinds, from gritty street-level brawls to epic battles between supernatural powers, and Bilgewater is no exception. Packed to the gills with smugglers, scofflaws, and scoundrels, Bilgewater is more than a common pirate haven, though it has more than its fair share of pirates, too!": "这是一个由冠军和怪物组成的世界，国家在征服和魔法的战争中崛起和衰落。Runeterra的许多土地上充满了各种各样的冒险，从街头巷尾的争斗到超自然力量之间的史诗般的战斗，Bilgewater也不例外。比尔吉沃特被走私者、恶棍和无赖挤得满满的，它不仅仅是一个普通的海盗天堂，尽管它也有超过其公平份额的海盗!",

	"A number of Runeterra's mightiest champions call Bilgewater their home. The gunslinging pirate legends Miss Sarah Fortune and Gangplank have famously battled for control of Bilgewater, and countless scoundrels have aligned themselves with these warring powers, seeking to wind up on top when the gunsmoke clears. Masters of the ocean depths like the armored Nautilus and occult powers like the kraken priestess Illaoi and the eldritch River King Tahm Kench pay frequent visits to the grimy shores of Bilgewater.": "许多鲁内特拉最强大的冠军都把比尔吉沃特当作自己的家。持枪的海盗传奇人物莎拉-财富小姐和甘普兰克曾为争夺比尔吉沃特的控制权而闻名，无数的恶棍与这些交战的势力结盟，试图在硝烟散尽后登上顶峰。像鹦鹉螺号这样的海洋深处的主人，以及像海怪女祭司伊拉奥伊和长生河王塔姆-肯奇这样的神秘力量，都经常到比尔吉沃特的肮脏海岸来。",
	"These champions are far from the only people making waves in Bilgewater, however.

Despite its dangers, however, Bilgewater is a paradise where everything is for sale, and fortune favors the bold.": "比尔吉沃特是一个由海怪猎人、走私者和海盗建立的独立港口城市。它是一个避风港，在这里，那些逃离债务、正义或迫害的人可以重新开始，而没有被困扰的过去所带来的负担。这座充满机遇的城市也充满了危险，它被险恶的地貌和充满怪物的海洋所包围。尽管危险重重，但比尔吉沃特是一个天堂，这里什么都可以卖，幸运之神眷顾勇敢的人。",
	"The city of Bilgewater began as an inhospitable stretch of land begrudgingly gifted by the Buhru to a group of refugees. These refugees sought to escape the oppressive rule of the mainland factions, wishing to start anew. Through luck and tenacity, these refugees built a life for themselves, and news of their new settlement began to spread. The cove that now forms Bilgewater was well hidden, dotted with spots to dock vessels, and better yet covered in abandoned ruins for shelter. These qualities made it an ideal hiding place for ships, and the settlers' resentment of mainland law made it an attractive port for pirates. As piracy ebbed and flowed in Runeterra with the rise and fall of factions, the cove remained a safe base for those evading the iron fist of naval forces.": "比尔吉沃特城开始时是一片荒凉的土地，是布赫鲁人勉强赠送给一群难民的。这些难民试图逃离大陆各派的压迫性统治，希望重新开始。通过运气和毅力，这些难民为自己创造了生活，他们新定居点的消息开始传播。现在形成比尔吉沃特的海湾非常隐蔽，到处都是停靠船只的地方，更好的是被废弃的废墟所覆盖，可以提供庇护。这些特点使它成为船只的理想藏身之处，而定居者对大陆法律的不满也使它成为吸引海盗的港口。随着各派系的兴衰，鲁奈特拉的海盗活动也在不断减少，小海湾仍然是那些躲避海军铁拳的安全基地。",
	"Inevitably, as more crews began to use the cove, the settlement began to expand. Traders willing to deal in stolen wealth, and entrepreneurs ready to cater to these crews set up shop amidst the ruins of the cove. The hardy settlers began to construct more permanent buildings, using found materials to build on top of the ruin foundations.": "不可避免的是，随着越来越多的船员开始使用这个海湾，这个定居点开始扩大。愿意交易被盗财富的商人和准备迎合这些船员的企业家们在海湾的废墟中开起了商店。顽强的定居者开始建造更多的永久性建筑，使用找到的材料在废墟的地基上建造。",
	"As the population of Bilgewater began to grow, the Buhru natives, once again, were forced to act. They approached the people of Bilgewater and held council with those most influential in the settlement. The Buhru agreed to allow the expansion of Bilgewater, on the condition that the city would never expand beyond the bay's confines. The people agreed to the terms, and with this victory in hand, Bilgewater began to flourish.": "随着比尔吉沃特的人口开始增长，布赫鲁土著人再一次被迫采取行动。他们与比尔吉沃特的人们接触，并与定居点中最有影响力的人举行了会议。布赫鲁人同意允许比尔吉沃特的扩张，但条件是该城市决不能扩张到海湾的范围之外。人们同意了这些条件，随着这场胜利的到来，比尔吉沃特开始繁荣起来。",
	"In the years that followed, a pirate captain named {@creature Gangplank|LoRDToB} came to serve as the unofficial ruler of Bilgewater crowning himself the Reaver King. He held this position of influence for years until an attempted assassination on his life by a bounty hunter named {@creature Miss Fortune|LoRDToB|Sarah Fortune}. While Gangplank managed to survive the attempt, his ship, and his most faithful followers were destroyed, forcing him to disappear from public view.": "在随后的几年里，一位名叫{@creature Gangplank|LoRDToB}的海盗船长成为比尔吉沃特的非官方统治者，并自封为海狸国王。他在这个位置上保持了多年的影响力，直到一个名叫{@creature Miss Fortune|LoRDToB|Sarah Fortune}的赏金猎人企图暗杀他的生命。虽然冈普兰克设法在这次暗杀中幸存下来，但他的船和他最忠实的追随者都被摧毁，迫使他从公众视野中消失。",
	"In the power vacuum following Gangplank's supposed death, a ruling body called the Corsair's Conclave formed. The Conclave was composed of the four most influential captains in Bilgewater (including Sarah Fortune), and they divided Bilgewater into territories to enforce their rule.": "在甘普兰克所谓的死亡后的权力真空中，一个名为海盗帮的统治机构成立了。该委员会由比尔吉沃特四个最有影响力的船长组成（包括莎拉-财富），他们将比尔吉沃特划分为多个地区，以实施他们的统治。",
	"After some peaceful years, three members of the Corsair's Conclave decided to band together and eliminate Sarah from their ranks. Following this betrayal, Miss Fortune staged a coup where she successfully murdered or banished the traitorous captains. Following this bloody event, Sarah became the only power remaining to control Bilgewater.": "经过几年的和平时期，海盗团的三名成员决定联合起来，将萨拉从他们的队伍中清除出去。在这次背叛之后，财富小姐发动了一场政变，她成功地谋杀或驱逐了那些叛徒队长。在这次血腥事件之后，莎拉成为控制比尔吉沃特的唯一力量。",
	"As of late, Gangplank has begun to make his presence known in the city. He has garnered the support of the Buhru in Bilgewater and grows his supporters aiming to claim his throne from Miss Fortune once again.": "最近，Gangplank已经开始在这个城市崭露头角。他在比尔吉沃特获得了布赫鲁人的支持，并壮大了他的支持者，旨在再次从财富小姐手中夺取他的王位。",
	"Bilgewater is a free city, flourishing with opportunity. These opportunities have given rise to a great many parties interested in controlling what Bilgewater has to offer.": "比尔吉沃特是一个自由的城市，充满了机遇。这些机会催生了许多对控制比尔吉沃特所提供的东西感兴趣的人。",
	"While there is no formal government established in Bilgewater, it is a city teeming with factions, each looking to further their own goals and agendas. Some of the active powers that shape life in Bilgewater are presented below.": "虽然比尔吉沃特没有建立正式的政府，但它是一个充斥着各种派别的城市，每个派别都在寻找自己的目标和议程。以下是一些影响比尔吉沃特生活的活跃力量。",
	"After a bloody coup, Sarah Fortune (colloquially known as '{@creature Miss Fortune|LoRDToB}') is the de facto ruling force in Bilgewater. Though she holds no official title, her allies and crew members enact her will in the city, applying pressure as needed to achieve her goals. She currently fixates on finding and killing Gangplank, who previously ruled Bilgewater.": "在一场血腥的政变之后，莎拉-财富（俗称\"{@creature Miss Fortune|LoRDToB}\"）成为比尔吉沃特事实上的统治者。虽然她没有正式的头衔，但她的盟友和船员在城市里贯彻她的意志，根据需要施加压力以实现她的目标。她目前专注于寻找并杀死之前统治比尔吉沃特的冈普兰克。",
	"{@creature Gangplank|LoRDToB} is the first and only captain to crown himself the Reaver King of Bilgewater. At the height of his power, he was deposed by Miss Fortune, and he now collects allies from the shadows of Bilgewater. His growing band of allies seeks to kill Miss Fortune and restore Gangplank to his place as Reaver King.": "{@creature Gangplank|LoRDToB}是第一个也是唯一一个自封为比尔吉沃特的海狸王的队长。在他权力的巅峰时期，他被财富小姐废黜，现在他从比尔吉沃特的阴影中收集盟友。他的盟友越来越多，试图杀死财富小姐，恢复江普兰克作为海狸王的地位。",
	"The Buhru inhabited the Serpent Isles for thousands of years before mainlanders founded Bilgewater. The Buhru still dominate the isles, and foreigners to their shores are only allowed to settle in Bilgewater. The Buhru have their language, capital city, and religion centered around the worship of the great Kraken Nagakabouros. The culture of the Buhru influences much of Bilgewater, and a healthy population of Buhru live in the city. While Buhru tolerate the settlement, the majority of them consider it to be a stain on their island.": "在大陆人建立比尔吉沃特之前，布赫鲁人已经在蛇岛居住了数千年。布赫鲁人仍然主宰着这些岛屿，来到他们海岸的外国人只被允许在比尔吉沃特定居。布赫鲁人有自己的语言、首都和宗教，并以对伟大的克拉肯-纳加布罗斯的崇拜为中心。布赫鲁人的文化影响了比尔吉沃特的大部分地区，在这个城市里生活着大量的布赫鲁人。虽然布赫鲁人容忍这个定居点，但他们中的大多数人认为这是对他们岛屿的玷污。",
	"Across the seas from the Serpent Isles, the many factions of Runeterra struggle against one another for control. Some of these factions have chosen to ally themselves with Bilgewater, while others seek to consume the city entirely.": "与蛇岛隔海相望，鲁奈特拉的许多派别为争夺控制权而相互斗争。其中一些派别选择与比尔吉沃特结盟，而另一些则试图完全吞噬这座城市。",
	"Southeast of the Serpent Isles lies the horrifying region known as the Shadow Isles. Since its corruption during a magical tragedy, the Shadow Isles emit dangerous black mists that routinely threaten the people of Bilgewater. These black mists thicken and travel across the ocean, flooding the Serpent Isles with undead spirits hungry for victims. This event has become known as 'The Harrowing,' and the power of the Buhru is the only thing that can keep its might at bay.": "蛇岛的东南方有一个被称为阴影岛的恐怖地区。自从它在一场魔法悲剧中被破坏后，阴影群岛就散发出危险的黑雾，经常威胁着比尔吉沃特的人们。这些黑雾变浓并穿越海洋，使蛇岛充斥着渴望受害者的不死之魂。这一事件被称为 \"劫难\"，而布赫鲁人的力量是唯一能阻止其威力的东西。",
	"Located Northwest of the Serpent Isles, is the evergrowing empire of Noxus. Noxians are determined to conquer Runeterra with aggressive expansionist action and have set their sights on Bilgewater as a potential resource for their naval campaigns. Noxus has not made any hostile action towards Bilgewater, but they have placed key soldiers in the port city, hoping to curry favor with the powers that struggle to control it.": "位于蛇岛的西北部，是不断发展的诺克萨斯帝国。诺克萨斯决心以侵略性的扩张行动征服鲁内特拉，并将目光投向比尔吉沃特，将其作为海军作战的潜在资源。诺克萨斯没有对比尔吉沃特采取任何敌对行动，但他们在这个港口城市安插了重要的士兵，希望能讨好那些争相控制它的势力。",
	"Bilgewater is a city teeming with wealth and opportunity. Residents can make their fortunes scouring the seas, hunting those who flee justice or catering to those who do.": "比尔吉沃特是一个充满财富和机会的城市。居民们可以在海上搜刮财富，猎杀那些逃离正义的人，或者迎合那些人的需求。",
	"Bilgewater is a lawless city, far from the reaches of the other factions of Runterra. Consequently, it attracts plenty of criminals aiming to flee justice. The presence of so many wanted criminals has given rise to a burgeoning population of bounty hunters. Bilgewater has several bounty boards, where new bounties are posted daily by pursers who pay out the hunters returning their targets dead or alive. With so many pirates, assassins, and criminals operating in and around Bilgewater, bounty hunting is an incredibly lucrative profession.": "比尔吉沃特是一个无法无天的城市，远离Runterra的其他派别。因此，它吸引了大量旨在逃避司法的罪犯。如此多的通缉犯的存在，使得赏金猎人的数量激增。比尔吉沃特有几个赏金委员会，每天都有新的赏金发布，由猎人支付给目标的死活。有这么多的海盗、刺客和罪犯在比尔吉沃特及其周围活动，赏金猎人是一个非常有利可图的职业。",
	"Bilgewater is famous for its monster-hunting trade, with its economy built around this burgeoning industry. The seas that surround the Serpent Isles are teeming with sea-monsters of every size and description. These monsters make travel around the city quite dangerous, but crews of monster hunters have turned this peril into profit. These individuals, sometimes referred to as 'serpent hunters,' embark on missions to hunt these monsters, slay them, then bring their corpses back to Bilgewater to sell to the highest bidder. Entire regions of Bilgewater host facilities built to process these corpses into food, treasures, and other sellable resources. A comfortable living can be made by hunting these monsters, or by working amongst the docks that process them.": "比尔吉沃特因其怪物狩猎贸易而闻名，其经济围绕这一新兴产业而发展。蛇岛周围的海域充斥着各种大小的海怪。这些怪物使城市周围的旅行相当危险，但怪物猎人团队已经将这种危险转化为利润。这些人有时被称为 \"猎蛇人\"，他们开始执行任务，猎杀这些怪物，然后把它们的尸体带回比尔吉沃特，卖给出价最高的人。比尔吉沃特的整个地区都建有将这些尸体加工成食物、宝物和其他可出售资源的设施。通过猎杀这些怪物，或者在处理这些怪物的码头工作，可以获得舒适的生活。",
	"If the swarms of sea monsters don't deter voyages to Bilgewater, then the brutal terrain certainly does. The seas around the Serpent Isles are dotted with rock formations and coral reefs that can destroy a ship before the crew realizes what they've hit. Many ships carrying valuable cargo have sunk to the ocean floor surrounding Bilgewater Bay, and retrieving these lost goods has become a profession. Treasure hunters and salvagers strike rich daily as they mine the ship graveyards just off of the coast. Traversing the ocean is incredibly dangerous, so skilled salvage divers can sell their services for extraordinary fees. Those with the stomach for the profession, make their fortunes retrieving lost treasures for merchants, for pirates, and by leading their private expeditions.": "如果说成群的海怪还不能阻止前往比尔吉沃特的航行，那么残酷的地形肯定能阻止它。蛇岛周围的海域遍布着岩石和珊瑚礁，这些岩石和珊瑚礁可以在船员意识到他们撞上什么之前就摧毁一艘船。许多载有珍贵货物的船只都沉没在比尔吉沃特湾周围的海底，而打捞这些丢失的货物已经成为一种职业。寻宝者和打捞者每天都会在海岸边的船舶墓地里挖到很多东西。穿越海洋是非常危险的，所以熟练的打捞潜水员可以将他们的服务卖到非常高的价格。那些有能力从事这一职业的人，通过为商人、海盗和带领他们的私人探险队找回丢失的宝物而发财。",
	"Piracy has been historically tied to the legacy of Bilgewater, and it remains an active portion of the city's economy today. Because Bilgewater operates outside of the law, it is one of the only places pirate crews can safely sell stolen goods for profit. Many of the businesses in the city cater specifically to these crews, who return after laborious stints at sea with pockets full of coin seeking revelry. Pirate crews can return to the bay without real fear of persecution since natural hazards surround the Serpent Isles. The best navigators jealously guard knowledge of safe routes to the Isles, which forces larger navy vessels to abandon hopes of landing on its shores. The only real threats to pirates in Bilgewater come from other stronger crews and the occasional bounty hunter.": "海盗行为在历史上一直与比尔吉沃特的遗产息息相关，而且今天它仍然是该城市经济的一个活跃部分。由于比尔吉沃特在法律之外运作，它是唯一一个海盗船员可以安全地出售赃物获利的地方。城市中的许多企业专门为这些船员提供服务，他们在海上劳累了一段时间后，带着满满一口袋的钱回来寻求狂欢。由于蛇岛周围的自然灾害，海盗船员可以回到海湾而不用担心受到迫害。最优秀的航海家们对通往蛇岛的安全路线的了解非常谨慎，这迫使大型海军船只放弃了在蛇岛海岸登陆的希望。在比尔吉沃特，对海盗的唯一真正威胁来自于其他更强大的船员和偶尔的赏金猎人。",
	"While Bilgewater is home to a vast collection of cultures and faiths, there are two beliefs of note that are unique to the Serpent Isles. ": "虽然比尔吉沃特是大量文化和信仰的家园，但有两种值得注意的信仰是蛇岛独有的。",
	"The Buhru religion is the main religion of the Buhru people native to the Serpent Isles. This religion centers around the worship of Nagakabouros, a god often depicted as a colossal kraken. Followers of the Buhru religion believe that every spirit was born to serve the universe, and the best way to fulfill personal destiny is to pursue one's inherent desires. ": "布赫鲁教是原产于蛇岛的布赫鲁人的主要宗教。该宗教围绕着对纳卡布罗斯（Nagakabouros）的崇拜而展开，纳卡布罗斯是一个经常被描绘成巨大的海怪的神。布赫鲁教的信徒认为，每个人的灵魂都是为宇宙服务的，而实现个人命运的最佳方式是追求自己固有的欲望。",
	"Nagakabouros is the deity that presides over life, the ocean, storms, and motion. While her true form is unknown, the image of the kraken most often represents her in religious iconography. The god is called the ‘Mother Serpent,' and the mass of sea monsters that fill the nearby oceans are known as the children of Nagakabouros. ": "纳卡布罗斯是主持生命、海洋、风暴和运动的神。虽然她的真实形态不详，但在宗教图腾中，海怪的形象最常代表她。该神被称为 \"母蛇\"，而充斥在附近海洋中的大量海怪则被称为纳卡布罗斯的孩子。",
	"Nagakabouros is a god that prefers action over words and has little patience for weakness or failure. One of the Buhru's religious rites is called the ‘Test of Nagakabouros,' in which an individual submits to vicious psychic assault from the god's spectral tentacles. Partakers who fail perish, but those who survive have demonstrated they possess the favor of the Mother of Serpents.": "Nagakabouros是一个重行动轻言语的神，对软弱或失败没有耐心。布赫鲁人的宗教仪式之一被称为 \"纳加布罗斯的考验\"，在这个仪式中，一个人要接受来自神的幽灵触手的恶毒的精神攻击。失败的人就会灭亡，但那些活下来的人则证明他们拥有蛇母的青睐。",
	"Several temples to Nagakabouros have been built in Bilgewater, though priests strictly limit which residents are allowed inside them. Even with these restrictions, the Buhru religion is growing in popularity amongst all the peoples of the city. This popularity has a great deal to do with the current spiritual leader of the Buhu, a priestess named Illaoi, who bears the honored title of Truth Bearer. Illaoi has been a staunch ally in protecting Bilgewater against the harmful effects of the Harrowing and is well regarded by the citizenry. When Gangplank ruled Bilgewater, Illaoi and the Buhru were close allies. With Gangplank's fall from grace, it remains unclear what role the Buhru will play in the politics of leadership. ": "在比尔吉沃特建有几座纳卡布罗斯的寺庙，尽管牧师们严格限制哪些居民可以进入这些寺庙。即使有这些限制，布胡教在这个城市的所有居民中也越来越受欢迎。这种受欢迎程度与布胡教目前的精神领袖有很大关系，她是一位名叫伊拉奥伊的女祭司，拥有真理承载者的荣誉称号。伊拉奥伊一直是保护比尔吉沃特的坚定盟友，使其免受 \"蹂躏 \"的有害影响，并受到市民们的好评。当冈普兰克统治比尔吉沃特的时候，伊拉奥伊和布赫鲁是亲密的盟友。随着冈普兰克的倒台，目前还不清楚布赫鲁会在领导政治中扮演什么角色。",
	"‘The Tithe' is a superstition as opposed to a full system of belief, but most sailors religiously observe it in Bilgewater. It is said that when a ship sets out to sail, the captain must make an offering to the sea (or some say to Nagakabouros) or risk the sea claiming the ship. Sailors usually keep a coin on their person just in case a tithe needs paying. ": "十一税 \"是一种迷信，而不是一个完整的信仰体系，但在比尔吉沃特，大多数水手都虔诚地遵守它。据说，当一艘船开始航行时，船长必须向大海（也有人说是向Nagakabouros）献上祭品，否则就会被大海夺走船只。水手们通常在身上放一枚硬币，以备需要缴纳什一税时使用。",
	"Cautionary tales warn of a salvage diver named Nautilus, who was dragged under the ocean and transformed into a monster when his captain refused to pay the tithe. ": "警示性的故事警告说，一个名叫鹦鹉螺的打捞者在他的船长拒绝支付什一税时被拖到海底，变成了一个怪物。",
	"Bilgewater is a sprawling city that expands both vertically and horizontally across the cliffs that form Bilgewater Bay. This urban sprawl is divided into several distinct districts, that host different types of residents and serve different functions. ": "比尔吉沃特是一个无序的城市，在形成比尔吉沃特湾的悬崖上垂直和水平地扩张。这个城市的扩张被划分为几个不同的区域，这些区域容纳了不同类型的居民，并具有不同的功能。",
	"Teeming with scoundrels and filth, Rat Town is the largest slum in Bilgewater. Here, thieves prowl the crooked alleyways alongside hoards of wharf rats, and exhausted slaughter fleet crews can grab a cheap pint before their next hunt.

	"Rat Town occupies the majority of Bilgewater's west side, ending at Butcher's Bridge. On any given day, individuals ranging from weathered old sea captains, to Demacian runaways, to even a few excitable Yordle can be found along the district's crooked streets. Due to this varied nature of its inhabitants, Rat Town boasts a myriad of architectural styles; tenements crammed into upturned Frejlordian logships sit against towering structures decorated with carvings of the Buhru, and you may even spot a tavern built from the bones of a long-dead sea monster. ": "老鼠镇占据了比尔吉沃特西部的大部分地区，在屠夫桥结束。在任何一天，从风化的老船长，到德玛西亚的逃亡者，甚至是一些兴奋的约德尔人，都可以在这个地区的弯曲街道上找到。由于其居民的不同性质，老鼠城拥有无数的建筑风格；挤在翻转的弗莱杰罗迪木船中的公寓与装饰着布赫鲁雕刻的高耸建筑相映成趣，你甚至可以看到一个用早已死去的海怪的骨头建造的酒馆。",
	"Though many who live in Rat Town earn their keep as tavern workers or members of various slaughter fleets, more enterprising individuals may seek out the neighborhood's various notice boards. Daring mercenaries can find postings there for everything ranging from traditional martial work to underhanded black market deals, and even bounties for some of Bilgewater's most notorious leaders. ": "虽然很多住在老鼠镇的人都是以酒馆工人或各种屠宰队的成员来维持生计，但更有魄力的人可能会去找附近的各种告示牌。大胆的雇佣兵可以在那里找到从传统的武术工作到暗中的黑市交易的各种信息，甚至可以找到一些比尔吉沃特最臭名昭著的领导人的悬赏。",
	"The raucous laughter from Fleet Street's taverns can be heard all the way in the White Wharf. Pubs of all sorts fill this section of Rat Town, and you can often catch a retired chatting over a half-drunken tankard, telling tall tales of ages long past on the salty sea.": "从舰队街的酒馆里传出的喧闹笑声在白码头一直可以听到。各种各样的酒吧充斥着鼠城的这一部分，你经常可以看到一个退休的人对着半醉的酒杯聊天，讲述过去很久以前在咸海中的高尚故事。",
	"Perhaps the most famous tavern in Fleet Street, the Brazen Hydra is a popular destination for sailors, gamblers, and mercenaries alike. Built inside the upturned hull of a former slaughter fleet ship, an intricate carved figurehead of a many-headed serpent towers over the tavern entrance.": "勇敢的九头蛇也许是舰队街最有名的酒馆，它是水手、赌徒和雇佣兵们的热门目的地。酒馆建在一艘前屠杀舰队的翻转船身内，一个复杂的多头蛇雕刻头像耸立在酒馆门口。",
	"Eager to show their prowess to potential employers, two raucous {@creature Ironback|LoRDToB|ironbacks} have engaged in various tavern games, including arm-wrestling, darts, and shouting matches.

	"The tavern itself spans three stories: the bar and kitchen occupy the ground floor, while card games and pool tables fill the second floor, and the top floor consists only of smaller private meeting rooms reserved for mercenaries and business deals. Though a few patrons visit the establishment during the day, the Brazen Hydra comes alive once the sun has set, and the exhausted ship crews pile in for a meal and a drink after a long day at sea. ": "酒馆本身有三层楼：酒吧和厨房占据了一楼，而纸牌游戏和台球桌则摆满了二楼，顶楼只包括为雇佣兵和商业交易保留的小型私人会议室。虽然白天也有一些顾客光顾，但太阳一落山，Brazen Hydra就活跃起来了，疲惫不堪的船员们在海上忙碌了一天后，都挤在这里吃饭喝酒。",
	"Horvon Beck (neutral, male human {@creature berserker}) runs the Brazen Hydra. After an encounter with a legendary sea monster left him unable to walk, Horvon personally carved himself leg braces from the bones of the vile monster and dragged the remains of his ship to shore to built the best pub Bilgewater has ever seen—at least, that's the story he likes to tell any bar patrons willing to listen. Many disregard his tale as an old sailor's legend, but the jagged ivory sheen of his leg braces (and the festering bite marks on the tavern's outside) suggest otherwise.": "霍冯-贝克（中立，男性人类（%0%））经营着Brazen Hydra。在一次与传说中的海怪相遇后，他无法行走，霍冯亲自用那只可恶的怪物的骨头给自己刻了腿套，并把他的船的残骸拖到岸上，建造了比尔吉沃特有史以来最好的酒吧--至少，这是他喜欢告诉任何愿意倾听的酒吧顾客的故事。许多人把他的故事看作是老水手的传说，但他的腿支架上锯齿状的象牙光泽（以及酒馆外面溃烂的咬痕）表明情况并非如此。",
	"Though not necessarily a section within Rat Town, the flophouses are nonetheless a prominent feature of the district. Many monster hunters and pirates down on their luck call these cheap tenements home in between dreary voyages.": "虽然不一定是老鼠城的一个部分，但食堂仍是该区的一个突出特点。许多怪物猎人和倒霉的海盗在沉闷的航行之间把这些廉价的公寓当作家。",
	"A foul disease is sweeping through the flophouses of Rat Town. Many are blaming a nest of {@creature diseased giant rats|LoRDToB} that has recently settled into a nearby shipwreck, yet no one knows yet what this sickness is, where it came from, or how to cure it. Brave mercenaries are racing to capture one of these diseased specimens and begin research for a cure.": "一种可怕的疾病正在席卷老鼠镇的食堂。许多人指责最近在附近的沉船上安家的一窝{@creature diseased giant rats|LoRDToB}，但还没有人知道这种疾病是什么，它来自哪里，或者如何治愈它。勇敢的雇佣兵们正竞相捕捉这些患病的标本之一，并开始研究治疗方法。",
	"A Freljordian ship smuggled a family of {@creature Yeti||yetis} into port. Unfortunately, the smuggler forgot to account for the warm island climate of Bilgewater, and the yetis have reacted poorly to the change in weather, breaking free from the flophouse stables originally holding them and running loose among the town. Where have the yetis disappeared off to? And why were they brought to Bilgewater in the first place?": "一艘弗雷尔乔迪的船将一个{@creature Yeti||yetis}的家庭偷运到港口。不幸的是，走私者忘了考虑比尔吉沃特温暖的岛屿气候，这些雪人对天气变化的反应很差，从原本关押他们的软屋马厩里挣脱出来，在镇上乱跑。这些雪人到底去了哪里？为什么他们会被带到比尔吉沃特？",
	"If you're looking for a place to sleep and keep the greedy wharf rats at bay, Raider's Hold is your inn. While not one of the nicest flophouses in Rat Town, Raider's Hold is infamous for its more flexible housing rates. The elderly pirate who runs the place, Captain Breanna Zyll (chaotic neutral, female human {@creature veteran}), is well-known throughout Bilgewater for dealing in favors instead of silver serpents. She will gladly provide you room and board for a week in exchange for hunting down a debtor or ensuring one of her rivals falters on their next voyage. Because of this, Breanna's bounty is one of the highest listed on the Bilgewater notice boards, and yet, none seem keen to take up arms against her, as everyone knows she has many powerful figures in her debt.

	"A few residents claim to have spotted the tidal trickster Fizz haunting the flophouse's halls some nights, but none have ever produced any evidence beyond their tall tales of his presence.": "一些居民声称发现潮汐魔术师菲兹在一些晚上在食堂的大厅里出没，但除了他们关于他存在的高谈阔论之外，没有人拿出任何证据。",
	"Butcher's Bridge sits on the far end of Rat Town, connecting the slum to both the Eyries in the upper parts of Bilgewater and the Temple of Nagakabouros. Made of ancient stone, Butcher's Bridge is one of the oldest structures in the city. The weathered cobblestones still bear the scars from Harrowings past, and a heavy wooden gate at its Western end is used to barricade the upper levels of the city against threats coming from port.": "屠夫桥位于老鼠城的最末端，连接着贫民窟和比尔吉沃特上部的眼球和纳卡布罗斯神庙。屠夫桥由古老的石头制成，是城市中最古老的建筑之一。风化的鹅卵石上还留有哈洛因过去留下的伤痕，桥的西端有一道沉重的木门，用来封锁城市的上层，防止来自港口的威胁。",
	"The Slaughter Docks form one of the coastal districts of Bilgewater. This area is composed of carving bays, killhouses, butcheries, and other places that service the booming monster-hunting industry. The streets of the slaughter docks often run with blood and other viscera following productive days of work, and its stench is infamous.": "屠宰码头构成了比尔吉沃特的沿海地区之一。这个地区由雕刻湾、杀戮屋、屠宰场和其他服务于蓬勃发展的怪物猎杀行业的地方组成。屠宰码头的街道上经常流淌着鲜血和其他内脏，其臭味是臭名昭著的。",
	"The buildings themselves are a testament to their trade, usually designed to resemble fearsome sea-beasts and built using the skins and bones of their likenesses.": "这些建筑本身就是他们行业的证明，通常被设计成可怕的海兽的样子，并使用它们的皮肤和骨骼建造。",
	"The waters surrounding the docks are tinged with red and poisoned by runoff, which drives any passing sea monsters away from Bilgewater's shores. This fact has increased tensions with the Buhru of Bilgewater, who depend on the sea monsters to provide aid when the Harrowing threatens the Serpent Isles.": "码头周围的水域染上了红色，并被径流毒害，这使得任何经过的海怪都远离比尔吉沃特的海岸。这一事实加剧了与比尔吉沃特的布赫鲁人之间的紧张关系，当哈罗威威胁到蛇岛时，他们依靠海怪来提供帮助。",
	"These massive docks are equipped with cranes and towers capable of hoisting even the most colossal monsters from the water. Captains with corpses to sell can expect to haggle fiercely for the service of a trustworthy bay before their catches rot in the water. Since profit depends on fresh material, the carving bays often boom with activity both day and night.": "这些巨大的码头配备了起重机和塔楼，甚至能够将最巨大的怪物从水中吊起。有尸体要卖的船长可以期待在他们的渔获腐烂在水里之前，为一个可靠的海湾的服务进行激烈的讨价还价。由于利润取决于新鲜的材料，雕刻海湾经常日夜繁忙。",
	"A hungry {@creature dragon shark|LoRDToB} has been spotted prowling the Carving Bays, snapping at docked ships and pulling carcasses right off crane hooks.

	"The killhouses of the slaughter docks are smelled long before they are spotted—these large warehouse-like buildings coated in the blood and slime of their trade. Once a corpse has been carved to pieces at a bay, it goes to these warehouses.": "屠宰码头的杀戮屋在被发现之前就已经被闻到了--这些类似仓库的大型建筑涂满了他们交易的血液和粘液。一旦一具尸体在海湾被切割成碎片，它就会被送到这些仓库里。",
	"Killhouses process these body parts into valuable skins, armor scales, and oil. They also clean and prepare sea monster bones and teeth to sell.": "屠宰场将这些身体部位加工成有价值的皮肤、盔甲鳞片和油。他们还清洗和准备海怪的骨头和牙齿来出售。",
	"Rumors have begun circulating the Slaughter Docks of a decrepit {@creature sea hag} lurking around the killhouses, absconding with valuable monster parts and even some unsuspecting workers to \"appease the beast below.\" What is the hag attempting to rouse from the depths—or worse, what is she trying to prevent from overtaking Bilgewater? Is a hag even responsible for these abductions, or is something more mundane the culprit?": "屠宰场里开始流传着这样的传言：一个腐朽的（%0%）潜伏在屠宰场周围，带着宝贵的怪物零件，甚至是一些毫无戒心的工人潜逃，以 \"安抚下面的野兽\"。这个巫婆试图从深渊中唤醒什么--或者更糟糕的是，她试图阻止什么东西笼罩比尔吉沃特？是巫婆要对这些绑架事件负责，还是有什么更平凡的东西是罪魁祸首？",

	"There is no formal union that rules the slaughter docks, but Junie Smith (lawful neutral, female human {@creature commoner}) is regarded as an unelected leader of the dock workers.

Because of this, the highest levels of the city, known as the Eyries, are home to the wealthiest taverns, theaters, and dice houses in the city. Those lucky enough to have some extra coin often make the long journey to these upper levels and relish in the fine drinks and luxurious company the Eyries' provide—though it's just as common for a sailor with too greedy an eye to lose their savings at one of the Eyries' high-stakes card tables, and be back at the Slaughter Docks the next morning.": "在比尔吉沃特有一个公认的真理：你爬得越高，你就越不容易淹死。正因为如此，城市的最高层被称为 \"眼\"，是城市中最富有的酒馆、剧院和骰子馆的所在地。那些幸运地拥有一些额外硬币的人经常长途跋涉到这些高层，享受眼界的美酒和奢华的陪伴--尽管对于一个过于贪婪的水手来说，在眼界的高赌注牌桌上输掉他们的积蓄，第二天早上回到屠宰码头也是很常见的。",
	"Though many dice houses and gambling halls can be found throughout Bilgewater, none have the high class and even higher stakes of those along Cardsharp Walk, the Eyries' primary gambling neighborhood.
