	"Every official monster is given a Challenge Rating (CR). A monster's CR acts as a quick reference for how powerful it is, and the XP reward derived from its value can be used to build combat encounters for the party to fight. Rules regarding the Challenge Rating system are given in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}.": "每个正式的怪物都有一个挑战等级（CR）。一个怪物的CR可以作为它的强大程度的快速参考，从它的价值中得到的XP奖励可以用来建立战斗遭遇，供队伍战斗。关于挑战等级系统的规则在（%0%）中给出。",
	"In short, the Challenge Rating system, when used by someone aware of its limitations, can be used to create monsters that are both properly balanced and fun to fight. By knowing the factors that influence CR, using the given charts to estimate what stats any monster should have at a certain CR, and by manipulating the numeric difference between a monster's Offensive Challenge Rating (OCR) and Defensive Challenge Rating (DCR), a DM can make monsters of all shapes and sizes. As an added bonus, the system's abstract nature leaves plenty of room for the DM to add extra abilities (e.g. imposing conditions or diseases) without imbalancing the monster too much.": "简而言之，挑战等级系统，如果被了解其局限性的人使用，就可以用来创造既适当平衡又有趣的怪物。通过了解影响挑战等级的因素，使用给定的图表来估计任何怪物在一定的挑战等级下应该有哪些属性，并通过操纵怪物的进攻性挑战等级（OCR）和防御性挑战等级（DCR）之间的数字差异，管理员可以制造各种形状和大小的怪物。作为一项额外的奖励，该系统的抽象性质为DM增加额外的能力（例如施加条件或疾病）留下了足够的空间，而不会使怪物过于不平衡。",
	"The encounter creation guidelines in the DMG fail to properly account for the \"action economy\", which refers to the number of discrete actions that can be taken by each side of the encounter. For example, a creature with Legendary Actions is much more capable of taking on a party by itself than a creature without such actions, even if the two are balanced to be at the same CR.": "DMG中的奇遇创建指南没有适当地考虑到 \"行动经济\"，这是指奇遇的每一方可以采取的不连续行动的数量。例如，一个拥有传奇行动的生物比一个没有这种行动的生物更有能力独自对付一方，即使两者的平衡是在相同的CR。",
	"Additionally, Challenge Rating is a one-size fits all rating system, but not all monsters are the same. Should I give a monster exactly the amount of hit points given on the table in the DMG? How should I weigh a \"tank\" monster's OCR versus its DCR? What about for a sneaky rogue-esque monster? And what about my custom boss fight?": "此外，挑战等级是一个一刀切的等级系统，但不是所有的怪物都是一样的。我是否应该完全按照DMG表中给出的命中率来给怪物加分？我应该如何权衡一个 \"坦克 \"怪物的OCR和它的DCR？对于一个鬼鬼祟祟的流氓式的怪物又该如何处理？那我的自定义BOSS战呢？",
	"As it turns out, the system provides most of the tools needed to rectify these problems. However, it does not adequately explain how to use such tools. While monster homebrewers can master the craft of monster design given enough practice, inexperienced creators will have trouble creating a properly designed monster given the supposedly balanced nature of the system, and might be (rightfully) upset that the official books don't give them any good advice on the matter.": "事实证明，该系统提供了纠正这些问题所需的大部分工具。然而，它并没有充分解释如何使用这些工具。虽然怪物自制者可以通过足够的练习掌握怪物设计的技巧，但考虑到系统的所谓平衡性，没有经验的创造者将很难创造出正确设计的怪物，并且可能会因为官方书籍没有在这个问题上给他们提供任何好的建议而（理所当然地）感到不安。",
	"Before I start elaborating on the Challenge Rating system, it is worth investigating what kinds of alternative approaches could be used instead. While all of these options are viable, I consider them to be inadequate in various ways. Thus, the rest of this document (starting with the content on the next page) is designed to expand upon the regular system that is given to us in the official books.": "在我开始阐述挑战评级系统之前，值得调查一下可以用哪些种类的替代方法来代替。虽然所有这些选择都是可行的，但我认为它们在不同方面都有不足之处。因此，本文件的其余部分（从下一页的内容开始）旨在扩展官方书籍中给我们的常规系统。",
	"Ah, the timeless classic. Instead of trying to use math to pretend everything is standardized, some people may wish to simply estimate what kind of statistics their monsters should have. The DM knows their party best: they know the kinds of abilities they have and the damage they can output. They also acknowledge that monster tactics and terrain features can significantly change the balance of a fight. This philosophy also applies to encounter balancing: I personally just throw some monsters at my players based on what I know they can handle.": "啊，永恒的经典。与其试图用数学来假装所有的东西都是标准化的，有些人可能希望简单地估计一下他们的怪物应该有什么样的统计数据。管理员最了解他们的队伍：他们知道他们有什么样的能力，他们能输出什么样的伤害。他们也承认，怪物的战术和地形特征可以大大改变战斗的平衡。这种理念也适用于遭遇战的平衡。我个人只是根据我所知道的他们能够处理的情况，向我的玩家扔一些怪物。",
	"This method requires an above average amount of game knowledge. Beginner DMs that try this may end up with some disastrous results. But when successful, it requires much less work than any other method.": "这种方法需要高于平均水平的游戏知识。尝试这种方法的新手管理员可能会以一些灾难性的结果而告终。但一旦成功，它所需要的工作就比其他方法少得多。",
	"Who cares if CR has some weird issues? Just use the system as-is to make a monster, and then just adjust things to how you see fit. You can also just copy statistics from existing monsters, or even just use such monsters as a \"base template\" for your own creations. For encounter balancing, see what the DMG gives you, and then change it to see if you know best.": "谁在乎CR是否有一些奇怪的问题？只要按原样使用该系统来制作怪物，然后按你认为合适的方式进行调整即可。你也可以直接复制现有怪物的统计数据，或者甚至只是将这些怪物作为你自己创作的 \"基础模板 \"来使用。对于遭遇平衡，看看DMG给了你什么，然后改变它，看看你是否最了解。",
	"This method is similar to Pure Improvisation, but it uses the existing system to make educated guesses. Even with the rules given in this document, any good DM will make their own adjustments as appropriate.": "这种方法类似于 \"纯粹的即兴发挥\"，但它使用现有的系统来进行有根据的猜测。即使有了本文给出的规则，任何好的管理员都会根据情况做出自己的调整。",
	"The people over at the Blog of Holding have realized that official monsters are a bit different from what the CR system suggests they should be. Their {@link 5e Monster Manual on a Business Card|https://blogofholding.com/?p=7338} provides statistical approximations of formulas you can use to create monsters that are mathematically consistent with official monsters.": "控股博客（Blog of Holding）的人已经意识到，官方怪物与CR系统所建议的怪物有些不同。他们的{@link 5e Monster Manual on a Business Card|https://blogofholding.com/?p=7338}提供了统计学上的近似公式，你可以用来创建在数学上与官方怪物一致的怪物。",
	"Inspired by the 4th Edition monster math, {@link Giffyglyph's Monster Maker|https://giffyglyph.com/monstermaker/index.html} is an approach to monster creation that is quick and easy, yet easily expanded upon. It has standardized statistics, monster roles and tiers, free-form attacks, paragon actions, and more.": "受第四版怪物数学的启发，{@link Giffyglyph's Monster Maker|https://giffyglyph.com/monstermaker/index.html}是一种创建怪物的方法，既快速简单，又容易扩展。它有标准化的统计数据、怪物角色和等级、自由形式的攻击、准绳行动等等。",
	"I haven't personally played with this system, but some of you may find it to be appealing. This system isn't perfect: for example, some people I know have criticized this system for leaning towards high HP values that artificially extend the length of fights, which I agree with. With that in mind, this document has some other goodies that are useful, including some that inspired the contents of this document (e.g. his take on monster roles and tiers, and his encounter building formula).": "我没有亲自玩过这个系统，但你们中的一些人可能会发现它很有吸引力。这个系统并不完美：例如，我认识的一些人批评这个系统偏向于高HP值，人为地延长了战斗的时间，我同意这个观点。考虑到这一点，这份文件还有一些其他有用的好东西，包括一些启发本文件内容的东西（例如他对怪物角色和等级的看法，以及他的遭遇战构建公式）。",
	"To continue, it is important to say the following: {@b not all monsters are the same}. Some are weak, some are overwhelmingly strong. Some charge in and swing wildly, and others shoot from a distance. We can use monster roles and tiers to account for such differences.": "要继续说下去，重要的是要说出以下内容。{@b not all monsters are the same}. 有的弱不禁风，有的强势压倒性。有的冲锋陷阵，疯狂挥舞，有的从远处射击。我们可以用怪物的角色和等级来说明这种差异。",
	"Just as characters within an adventuring party might specialize in certain roles (e.g. tanking), monsters can also be given categories based on their role(s) in combat.": "就像冒险队伍中的角色可能专门从事某些角色（例如坦克手）一样，怪物也可以根据它们在战斗中的角色而被归类。",
	"{@b Brutes} hit hard and get hit hard. They deal a lot of damage in melee, and while they might be easy to hit, they have a lot of hit points to compensate. Having loads of HP isn't enough: if a brute can't deal damage or otherwise attract the attention of the enemy, they can simply be ignored, and they will fail at tanking. {@creature ogre zombie|mm|Ogre zombies} (and other types of {@creature zombie|mm|zombies}), {@creature hill giant|mm|hill giants}, and {@creature purple worm|mm|purple worms} are all examples of brutes.": "{@b Brutes}命中率高，被打得很惨。他们在近战中造成大量的伤害，虽然他们可能很容易被击中，但他们有大量的命中率来弥补。有大量的HP是不够的：如果一个野蛮人不能造成伤害或以其他方式吸引敌人的注意，他们可以简单地被忽视，他们在坦克方面会失败。{@creature ogre zombie|mm|Ogre zombies}（和其他类型的{@creature zombie|mm|zombies}）、{@creature hill giant|mm|hill giants}和{@creature purple worm|mm|purple worms}都是蛮牛的例子。",
	"{@b Controllers} use their abilities for utility, rather than just damage. Some controllers manipulate the battlefield by negating vision or creating difficult terrain. Others inflict \"debuffs\" upon their foes that lessen their offensive or defensive power, such as by imposing disadvantage on their attack rolls or saving throws. Many controllers even use their powers to directly disable their opponents by charming, incapacitating, or restraining them. Such powers can take the form of magical or psionic abilities activated from a distance, or they can be delivered in melee via auras or on top of melee attacks. {@creature harpy|mm|Harpies}, {@creature mind flayer|mm|mind flayers}, and {@creature rakshasa|mm|rakshasas} are all examples of controllers.": "{@b Controllers}将他们的能力用于实用，而不仅仅是伤害。一些控制者通过否定视野或创造困难的地形来操纵战场。其他人则对他们的敌人施加 \"debuffs\"，削弱他们的攻击力或防御力，例如对他们的攻击卷或蓄力投掷施加不利因素。许多控制者甚至使用他们的力量，通过魅惑、使其丧失能力或限制他们，直接使其对手丧失能力。这种力量可以采取从远处激活的魔法或幻觉能力的形式，也可以通过光环或近战攻击的方式在近战中传递。{@creature harpy|mm|Harpies}, {@creature mind flayer|mm|mind flayers}, 和{@creature rakshasa|mm|rakshasas}都是控制者的例子。",
	"{@b Skirmishers} weave in and out of combat, using their mobility and slipperiness to avoid the exposure of their fragile defenses. They wait for a good opportunity to strike, typically aiming at the weakest or otherwise easiest opponent to attack without taking damage themselves. Often times, they have traits such as Nimble Escape or Flyby that allow them to move in and out without being punished as other creatures would. {@creature assassin|mm|Assassins}, {@creature bugbear|mm|bugbears}, and {@creature goblin|mm|goblins} are all examples of skirmishers.": "{@b Skirmishers}在战斗中穿梭，利用他们的机动性和滑溜性来避免暴露他们脆弱的防御能力。他们等待一个好的机会进行攻击，通常瞄准最弱的或其他最容易攻击的对手，而自己不受伤害。通常情况下，他们有一些特性，如灵活的逃逸或飞翔，使他们能够进退自如，而不像其他生物那样受到惩罚。{@creature assassin|mm|Assassins}、{@creature bugbear|mm|bugbears}和{@creature goblin|mm|goblins}都是小兵的例子。",
	"{@b Snipers} are those that choose to deal damage from a distance. They have weak defensive capabilities, which they compensate for using good positioning that prevents them from easily being engaged in melee. They needn't hide like skirmishers, nor must they deal as much damage as a striker, although they are allowed to if appropriate. {@creature archer|vgm|Archers}, {@creature beholder|mm|beholders}, and {@creature scout|mm|scouts} are all examples of snipers.": "{@b Snipers}是那些选择从远处造成伤害的人。他们有较弱的防御能力，他们用良好的定位来弥补，以防止他们轻易被近战。他们不需要像小兵那样躲藏，也不需要像前锋那样造成大量的伤害，尽管在适当的情况下他们可以这样做。{@creature archer|vgm|Archers}、{@creature beholder|mm|beholders}和{@creature scout|mm|scouts}都是狙击手的例子。",
	"{@b Soldiers} are generalists who can both take damage and deal damage as needed. While most soldiers are melee-centric, some also have access to ranged options, but do not focus on them to the point of being full on snipers. {@creature veteran|mm|Veterans}, {@creature hezrou|mm|hezrous}, and {@creature erinyes} are all examples of soldiers. Many basic enemies that serve as minions (see below), such as {@creature bandit|mm|bandits}, {@creature orc|mm|orcs}, and {@creature skeleton|mm|skeletons}, also act as soldiers by default.": "{@b Soldiers}是既能承受伤害又能根据需要造成伤害的通才。虽然大多数士兵是以近战为中心的，但有些士兵也可以选择远程攻击，但不会专注于此，以至于成为全能的狙击手。{@creature veteran|mm|Veterans}、{@creature hezrou|mm|hezrous}和{@creature erinyes}都是士兵的例子。许多作为小兵的基本敌人（见下文），如（%4%）、（%5%）和（%6%），也默认为士兵。",
	"{@b Strikers} are the major damage dealers in a given encounter. A striker's offensive power tends to be notably stronger than its defense. Despite this, strikers are not exclusively ranged attackers; it is possible for a striker to be a melee combatant. With this in mind, many spellcasters lend themselves to be excellent strikers. {@creature archmage|mm|Archmages}, dragons, and {@creature lich|mm|liches} are all examples of strikers.": "{@b Strikers}是在一个特定的遭遇中的主要伤害处理者。前锋的攻击力往往明显强于其防御力。尽管如此，前锋并不完全是远程攻击者；前锋也有可能是近战者。考虑到这一点，许多施法者都能成为优秀的前锋。{@creature archmage|mm|Archmages}、龙和{@creature lich|mm|liches}都是前锋的例子。",
	"When categorizing a monster under a monster role, keep in mind that some monsters have abilities and traits that touch upon multiple roles at once. For example, while glabrezus are powerful in direct melee combat, allowing them to act as soldiers, they also have access to potent spells such as {@spell darkness} and {@spell power word stun} that also make them controllers.": "当把一个怪物归入一个怪物角色时，请记住，有些怪物的能力和特性同时触及多个角色。例如，虽然格拉布雷斯在直接的近战中很强大，使它们可以充当士兵，但它们也可以使用强有力的法术，如（%0%）和（%1%），这也使它们成为控制者。",
	"If you'd like, you can give certain enemies two roles, or you can give them a \"major\" and \"minor\" role. For example, {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} are best labeled as soldiers, but you can also have some of them act exclusively as snipers during a given encounter. Meanwhile, {@creature goblin|mm|goblins} might use their Nimble Escape feature to attack from range with impunity, making them both skirmishers and snipers.": "如果你愿意，你可以给某些敌人两个角色，或者你可以给他们一个 \"主要 \"和 \"次要 \"角色。例如，{@creature bandit|mm|bandits}最好被标记为士兵，但你也可以让他们中的一些人在特定的遭遇中专门充当狙击手。同时，{@creature goblin|mm|goblins}可能会使用他们的灵活逃生功能，从范围内肆无忌惮地攻击，使他们既是小兵又是狙击手。",
	"No matter what you do, I encourage you to somehow take advantage of this role overlap to fill any gaps in a given encounter. For example, in an encounter with a demonic horde of mostly skirmishers and snipers, a {@creature glabrezu} would be able to engage the party head-on while also using their controller abilities to compliment their allies' roles in the encounter.": "无论你做什么，我鼓励你以某种方式利用这种角色重叠来填补特定遭遇中的任何空白。例如，在一个主要由小兵和狙击手组成的恶魔部落的遭遇战中，一个{@creature glabrezu}的人将能够与党派正面交锋，同时还能使用他们的控制能力来补充他们的盟友在遭遇战中的角色。",
	"While many monsters have different roles to play in combat, the challenge they pose to the party gives them a tier of difficulty that is worth noting or taking advantage of.": "虽然许多怪物在战斗中扮演着不同的角色，但它们给党派带来的挑战使它们具有一定的难度，值得注意或利用。",
	"{@b Minions} are simple, weak enemies used en masse as fodder against the enemy. They are often encountered in large groups, and they serve as a stopgap between important creatures and the enemies that oppose them. Any individual minion is simple to defeat for any competent combatant, but if they aren't careful, a large group of minions can overwhelm an adventuring party before they even reach their main opponent.": "{@b Minions}是简单、弱小的敌人，被集体用作对付敌人的炮灰。他们经常以大群的形式出现，在重要的生物和反对他们的敌人之间充当一个挡箭牌。对于任何有能力的战斗人员来说，任何单个的爪牙都很容易被打败，但如果他们不小心，一大群爪牙可以在冒险队到达主要对手之前就把他们淹没。",
	"{@b Standard} enemies are the typical foes fought in a given encounter. They will take a bit of time to defeat, and while they can be dangerous in groups of two or more, no standard enemy will be a deadly threat to an adventuring party by itself.": "{@b Standard}的敌人是在一个特定的遭遇战中的典型敌人。他们需要花点时间来打败，虽然他们在两个或更多的群体中可能很危险，但没有一个标准的敌人会对冒险队伍本身构成致命的威胁。",
	"{@b Elite} enemies are a cut above the rest. They are typically accompanied by standard enemies and/or minions, and they are major threats that have the potential to take down the party if given the chance. In a videogame, an elite enemy would be a miniboss or some other encounter that is significantly more challenging than the rest.": "{@b Elite}的敌人是比其他的人要高一等的。他们通常伴随着标准的敌人和/或小兵，而且他们是主要的威胁，如果有机会的话，他们有可能击垮队伍。在电子游戏中，精锐的敌人是指一个小怪兽或其他一些明显比其他敌人更具挑战性的遭遇。",
	"{@b Champions} are powerful foes that turn a normal encounter into a boss battle. Either they are accompanied by minions and other lesser monsters, or they are strong enough to take on their opponents by themselves. They typically have Legendary Resistances, Legendary Actions, or some other mechanics that allow them to keep up with the party in both offense and defense despite being only one creature, but such features aren't required for all champions.": "{@b Champions}是强大的敌人，可以把普通的遭遇战变成一场BOSS战。他们要么有小兵和其他较小的怪物相伴，要么强大到可以独自对付对手。他们通常拥有传奇抗性、传奇行动或其他一些机制，使他们在进攻和防守方面都能跟上队伍的步伐，尽管他们只是一个生物，但这样的特点并不是所有冠军都需要。",
	"As an example of these monster tiers, suppose that a high level adventuring party enters a lich's lair to put an end to its evil machinations forever. They are faced by its {@creature skeleton} and {@creature zombie} minions, as well as some standard-tier {@creature barlgura|mm|barlguras} summoned as part of the lich's fiendish pact with an unnamed demon lord. It has an elite-tier {@creature iron golem} guarding the entrance to its inner sanctum, and the actual {@creature lich}, once encountered, acts as a champion-tier opponent.": "作为这些怪物等级的一个例子，假设一个高等级的冒险队伍进入了一个巫师的巢穴，以永远结束它的邪恶阴谋。他们面对的是它的{@creature skeleton}和{@creature zombie}爪牙，以及一些标准级{@creature barlgura|mm|barlguras}的召唤物，这些召唤物是巫妖与一个不知名的恶魔领主签订的恶魔契约的一部分。它有一个精英级的{@creature iron golem}守卫在其内部圣殿的入口处，而真正的{@creature lich}，一旦遇到就会成为冠军级的对手。",
	"{@b Leaders} enable their comrades to perform at a higher capacity compared to normal. Some leaders boost the hit points of their allies, such as through healing magic or by giving them temporary hit points. Others boost their offensive power, in ways such as commanding them to attack using their reaction or by granting them advantage on attack rolls. Some leaders even summon additional allies into the battle, through methods such as conjuration spells or by exuding a lesser creature from its body. {@creature gnoll pack lord|mm|Gnoll pack lords}, {@creature hobgoblin warrior|mm|hobgoblin warlords}, and {@creature orc war chief|mm|orc war chiefs} are all examples of leaders.": "{@b Leaders}使他们的战友能够以比正常情况下更高的能力执行。有些领袖会提高他们盟友的命中率，例如通过治疗魔法或给予他们临时命中率。其他的则是提高他们的攻击力，例如命令他们使用反应力进行攻击，或者给予他们攻击卷的优势。有些领袖甚至通过施展法术或从其身体中释放出一种较低级的生物等方法，召唤额外的盟友加入战斗。{@creature gnoll pack lord|mm|Gnoll pack lords}、{@creature hobgoblin warrior|mm|hobgoblin warlords}和{@creature orc war chief|mm|orc war chiefs}都是领袖的例子。",
	"This designation is halfway between a role and a tier. It has a distinct playstyle in an encounter, but its broad nature doesn't reveal anything about a monster's offensive or defensive capabilities. While a leader typically won't be a minion, its status does not tell us if it is a standard enemy, an elite enemy, or a champion-tier one.": "这一称呼介于角色和等级之间。它在一场遭遇战中具有独特的玩法，但其广泛的性质并没有揭示出怪物的进攻或防御能力。虽然一个首领通常不会是一个小兵，但它的地位并不能告诉我们它是一个标准的敌人，一个精英的敌人，还是一个冠军级的敌人。",
	"As such, consider the \"leader\" designation to be both a \"minor role\" and a \"minor tier\" as you see fit. Determine the monster's primary role and tier, and apply them as you see fit.": "因此，根据你的判断，将 \"领袖 \"指定为 \"次要角色 \"和 \"次要等级\"。确定怪物的主要角色和等级，并按你认为合适的方式应用它们。",
	"While this might seem obvious, it is still important to state that a monster's tier is measured in comparison to the adventuring party that fights them. For example, the balguras in the above example are mentioned to be standard-tier enemies for the high level adventuring party, but for a much weaker party that is just starting out, a balgura can act as an elite or champion-tier opponent, depending on just how weak the party really is.": "虽然这看起来很明显，但仍有必要说明，怪物的等级是根据与它们战斗的冒险队伍的对比来衡量的。例如，上面的例子中提到的巴尔古拉对于高水平的冒险队伍来说是标准级别的敌人，但是对于刚刚起步的弱小队伍来说，巴尔古拉可以作为精英或冠军级别的对手，这取决于该队伍到底有多弱。",
	"This means that at your party levels up, you may need to continually use stronger foes in order to properly challenge your party. And that's okay: after all, as your party levels up, they become more powerful, so they become capable of defeating bigger and better threats as time goes on.": "这意味着，在你的队伍等级提高时，你可能需要不断地使用更强大的敌人，以便适当地挑战你的队伍。这也没关系：毕竟，随着你的队伍等级的提高，他们变得更加强大，所以随着时间的推移，他们有能力击败更大更好的威胁。",
	"Now that we know how monster roles and tiers work, we can use this knowledge to determine how we make our monsters, taking advantage of the existing Challenge Rating system to balance them appropriately.": "现在我们知道了怪物的角色和层级是如何运作的，我们可以利用这些知识来决定如何制作我们的怪物，利用现有的挑战等级系统来适当地平衡它们。",
	"The role and tier information presented here will be used in later sections of this document, so be ready to reference them as needed.": "这里介绍的角色和层级信息将在本文件后面的章节中使用，所以要准备好在需要时参考它们。",
	"Most official monsters, especially the ones found in supplements beyond the {@book Monster Manual|mm} (e.g. {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|mtf}), have at least a little more offensive power than defensive power. This makes sense: too much defense makes a fight too sluggish and boring, and too little offense makes a monster not feel threatening to the party.": "大多数官方怪物，特别是在{@book Monster Manual|mm}以外的补充材料中发现的怪物（例如{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|mtf}），至少有比防御力多一点的攻击力。这是有道理的：过多的防御使战斗过于迟缓和无聊，而过少的进攻则使怪物感觉不到对当事人的威胁。",
	"In particular, many of the monsters in the {@i Monster Manual} have an OCR that is 6 more than its DCR (before traits come into play). Based on some existing statistical analyses and my own personal investigations, this seems to be an intentional choice.": "特别是，{@i Monster Manual}中的许多怪物的OCR比其DCR多6（在特性发挥作用之前）。根据一些现有的统计分析和我个人的调查，这似乎是一个有意的选择。",
	"With this in mind, below is a table listing a recommended range of numeric differences between a monster's OCR and DCR, depending on its role.": "考虑到这一点，下面的表格列出了一个怪物的OCR和DCR之间的数字差异的建议范围，这取决于它的作用。",

	"Controller": "控制器",
	"Skirmisher": "小兵",
	"Sniper": "狙击手",
	"Soldier": "军队",
	"Striker": "前锋",
	"Note that since a monster's overall CR is a combination of its OCR and DCR, the difference between a monster's OCR and DCR will not influence its CR. For example, a CR 10 striker might be OCR 14/DCR 6, while a CR 10 brute might be OCR 11/DCR 9. The two have the same Challenge Rating, but their actual statistics, other than their proficiency bonuses, will look completely different.": "请注意，由于怪物的整体 CR 是其 OCR 和 DCR 的组合，怪物的 OCR 和 DCR 之间的差异不会影响其 CR。例如，一个CR10的前锋可能是OCR14/DCR6，而一个CR10的野蛮人可能是OCR11/DCR9，两者有相同的挑战等级，但他们的实际统计数据，除了他们的熟练度奖励，看起来完全不同。",
	"To simplify the averaging and subtraction of fractional CRs, treat them as negative integers: CR 1/2 is really 0, CR 1/4 is -1, CR 1/8 is -2, and CR 0 is -3. Then, after your calculations are finished, convert their CR back to their proper, fractional form. This is because {@b CR is actually a median}, rather than an average.": "为了简化小数CR的平均数和减法，把它们当作负整数。CR 1/2实际上是0，CR 1/4是-1，CR 1/8是-2，而CR 0是-3。然后，在你的计算完成后，将它们的CR转换回正确的、小数的形式。这是因为（%0%），而不是一个平均值。",
	"We can use the Average Party Level (APL) of the player characters to determine the recommended CR range for each given monster tier, as listed below. These tier definitions break down and become inaccurate at higher levels, but are otherwise a reasonable starting point for your monsters.": "我们可以使用玩家角色的平均等级（APL）来确定每个给定怪物等级的推荐CR范围，如下所示。这些级别的定义在更高的级别中会被打破并变得不准确，但在其他方面是你的怪物的一个合理的起点。",
	"Minion": "奴才",

	"Champion": "冠军",
	"APL × 5/4 to APL × 3/2": "APL × 5/4 到 APL × 3/2",
	"These CR ranges apply to parties with three to five players in it.

	"Okay, so I've told you about monster roles, tiers, and how to balance them out using CR. But how do you actually make a monster?": "好了，我已经告诉你关于怪物的角色、等级以及如何使用CR来平衡它们。但是，你实际上是如何制作一个怪物的呢？",
	"Between the DMG's Challenge Rating rules and the advice in this document, you should be able to make monsters that just as fun and balanced as official monsters.": "在DMG的挑战等级规则和本文件的建议之间，你应该能够制作出和官方怪物一样有趣和平衡的怪物。",
	"When I design monsters in 5e, I take into account the following factors.": "当我在5e中设计怪物时，我考虑到了以下因素。",
	"To make a monster, you first have to establish its theme: what it looks like, how it acts, how it feels to fight it, etc. If you are converting a monster from an external source, such as a previous edition of D&D or some other form of media, the theme is already there for you to take. However, remember that {@b the theme of a monster is independent from the medium it is viewed from}. In other words, make sure that your theme isn't particularly reliant on mechanics that don't port over well to 5e.": "要制作一个怪物，你首先要确定它的主题：它看起来像什么，它的行为方式，与它战斗的感觉，等等。如果你是从外部来源转换怪物，比如以前的D&D版本或其他形式的媒体，那么主题已经在那里了，你可以取舍。然而，请记住，（%0%）。换句话说，要确保你的主题不是特别依赖那些不能很好地移植到5e的机制。",
	"For example, if you are converting a monster that originates from an action game, much of the fight might be centered around its individual attacks and successfully blocking or dodging them. However, 5e is a turn-based game that doesn't do reflex-based combat like that. Thus, instead of trying to take its mechanics and brute force them into 5e, try to simply focus on what makes the monster cool/scary/intense/etc. You will then capture the essence of this theme, either through compatible mechanics or through new ones, through the statistics you give it in 5e.": "例如，如果你要转换一个源自动作游戏的怪物，战斗的大部分内容可能是围绕它的个别攻击和成功地阻挡或躲避它们。然而，5e是一个回合制游戏，不会像那样做基于反射的战斗。因此，与其试图把它的机制强加到5e中，不如试着简单地把重点放在怪物的酷/恐怖/紧张/等方面。然后，你将通过兼容的机制或通过新的机制，通过你在5e中给它的统计数字来捕捉这个主题的本质。",
	"In any case, consider the following factors when attempting to build a monster's theme:": "在任何情况下，在试图建立一个怪物的主题时要考虑以下因素。",
	"The general tactics it uses in combat (i.e. what monster role it would have)": "它在战斗中使用的一般战术（即它会有什么样的怪物角色）。",
	"The kinds of tactics that work well against it (based on its role in combat)": "对付它的那种战术很有效（根据它在战斗中的作用）。",
	"How strong it should be relative to the world and the players (i.e. what CR and monster tier you should give it)": "相对于世界和玩家，它应该有多强（即你应该给它什么样的CR和怪物等级）。",
	"What emotion/feeling it should illicit to those that fight it": "对那些与之斗争的人来说，应该有什么样的情感/感觉？",
	"What it does out of combat and/or when the players aren't around": "它在战斗之外和/或当玩家不在身边时做什么？",
	"The generic abilities it has (e.g. \"fire blasts\", \"big punches\", \"invisibility and teleporation\")": "它所具有的一般能力（如 \"火焰喷射\"、\"大拳头\"、\"隐形和远程控制\"）。",
	"It is important to create monsters that are neither underpowered or overpowered for their CR. When underpowered, such creatures get steamrolled by the party, making it unfun for the DM that wanted to use them and boring for the players that seek to be adequately challenged in combat. When a monster is overpowered, it can easily crush unprepared players, making them feel bad for losing and making you feel bad for ruining their fun.": "重要的是要创造出对其CR来说既不太强大也不太强大的怪物。当力量不足时，这种生物就会被队伍碾压，使想使用它们的管理员感到无趣，而对那些想在战斗中得到充分挑战的玩家来说则很无聊。当一个怪物的力量过大时，它可以轻易地压垮没有准备的玩家，使他们因失去而感到难过，使你因破坏了他们的乐趣而感到难过。",
	"To balance monsters, use the monster creation rules in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}, which are supplemented by the advice and expansions made in this document.": "为了平衡怪物，请使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}中的怪物创建规则，这些规则由本文件中提出的建议和扩展来加以补充。",
	"So you've made a cool monster with a strong theme that is balanced by the books. You try it out in a session, only to find that your players are peeved by its very existence and that they didn't enjoy the fight with it. What gives?": "所以你做了一个很酷的怪物，有一个很强的主题，并在书中得到了平衡。你在一次会议中试用了它，却发现你的玩家对它的存在感到不满，而且他们并不喜欢与它的战斗。这是为什么呢？",
	"Perhaps unfair and unfun mechanics are to blame. Here are a few examples:": "也许不公平和不有趣的机制是罪魁祸首。这里有几个例子。",
	"Overusing action-negating effects such as the {@condition paralyzed} and {@condition stunned} conditions, as well as large amounts of unavoidable damage, can take certain players out of the fight entirely, making them feel as if they have nothing to do and that the fight is boring.": "过度使用诸如{@condition paralyzed}和{@condition stunned}条件的行动否定效果，以及大量不可避免的伤害，会使某些玩家完全脱离战斗，使他们觉得自己无事可做，战斗很无聊。",
	"Reactions that completely negate a character's actions can be unfun when not limited in usage. For example, spells like {@spell counterspell} are established in the world and can create interesting twists during an encounter, but when usable at will, the spellcasters of the party might feel useless. Similarly, other \"gotcha!\" moments and effects like \"Surprise, it is immune to all spells!\" can be unfair to players that are simply trying to fight a monster as they are expected to.": "完全否定角色行动的反应在不限制使用的情况下可能会很不有趣。例如，像（%0%）这样的法术在这个世界上是成立的，并能在遭遇战中创造出有趣的转折，但当可以随意使用时，聚会中的施法者可能会感到无用。同样，其他 \"中招了！\"的时刻和效果，如 \"惊讶吧，它对所有法术都免疫！\"可能对那些只是想按照预期与怪物战斗的玩家不公平。",
	"Instakills and other character-removing effects are extremely strong and should not be taken lightly. {@creature intellect devourer|mm|Intellect devourers} (death by brain removal) and {@creature medusa|mm|medusas} (character removal by {@condition petrified|phb|petrification} without an available cure) are both examples of monsters that have such effects. These monsters are deviations from the norm: they are classic, iconic creatures that are popular and dangerous because of their extremely potent abilities. You need a very strong justification for including such an effect on a monster, and in play, you should consider telegraphing the ability (e.g. by informing the players about it ahead of time) so that they aren't deleted without any prior warning.": "瞬杀和其他清除角色的效果是非常强大的，不应掉以轻心。{@creature intellect devourer|mm|Intellect devourers}（通过脑部移除而死亡）和{@creature medusa|mm|medusas}（通过{@condition petrified|phb|petrification}移除角色而没有可用的治疗方法）都是具有此类效果的怪物的例子。这些怪物是对常规的偏离：它们是经典的、标志性的生物，由于其极其强大的能力而受到欢迎和危险。你需要有很强的理由在怪物身上加入这样的效果，而在游戏中，你应该考虑将这种能力预告出来（例如提前告知玩家），这样它们就不会在没有任何事先警告的情况下被删除。",
	"As mentioned earlier, WotC has its own custom math that it follows when designing monsters that deviates from the Challenge Rating guidelines they gave us. It is for this reason that I personally don't follow the CR guidelines to the letter. What should you do?": "如前所述，WotC在设计怪物时有自己的自定义数学，偏离了他们给我们的挑战等级指南。正是由于这个原因，我个人并不完全遵循挑战等级指南。你应该怎么做？",
	"Most official monsters are properly balanced according to CR anyway. Those that deviate tend to only differ by a small amount. Thus, it is easy to simply use the system in the DMG and to make small adjustments as appropriate. In general, {@b monsters are allowed to be a bit stronger than their official CR suggests}, whether it be due to powerful non-damaging effects that aren't accounted for, or due to certain statistics and traits that aren't actually as important as the DMG says they are.": "反正大多数官方怪物都是根据CR进行适当的平衡。那些偏离的怪物往往只相差很小的数量。因此，很容易简单地使用DMG中的系统，并在适当的时候做出小的调整。一般来说，（%0%），无论是由于强大的非破坏性效果没有被计算在内，还是由于某些统计数据和特征实际上并不像DMG所说的那么重要。",
	"In particular, I have personally observed that the following factors aren't weighted as heavily by WotC as they are in the DMG:": "特别是，我个人观察到，WotC对以下因素的权重并不像DMG中那样高。",
	"Traits like Blood Frenzy and Nimble Escape are very powerful, and they do significantly contribute to a monster's potency in combat, but their effect on Challenge Rating seems to differ from monster to monster. For example, {@creature goblin|mm|goblins} seem to be balanced as though they didn't have the Nimble Escape feature at all. The same applies to other traits given in the DMG. All of this can be attributed to WotC's playtesting feedback, where deviations from the default math are improvements to the monster based on what felt right in play. In your case, you shouldn't ignore the presence of these traits altogether, but you should account for them collectively when determining the monster's final CR.": "像 \"热血沸腾 \"和 \"灵活逃脱 \"这样的特性非常强大，它们确实对怪物的战斗力有很大的帮助，但它们对挑战等级的影响似乎因怪物而异。例如，{@creature goblin|mm|goblins}似乎被平衡了，好像它们根本就没有敏捷逃脱的特性。这同样适用于DMG中给出的其他特征。所有这些都可以归因于WotC的游戏测试反馈，其中对默认数学的偏离是根据游戏中的感觉对怪物的改进。在你的案例中，你不应该完全忽视这些特征的存在，但你应该在确定怪物的最终CR时将它们一并考虑在内。",
	"Legendary Resistances are worth little effective HP, if any at all (depends on how high the CR is). I personally see legendary resistances as an extension of a monster's tier (i.e. boss monsters should almost always have them when they are solo), so I only truly account for them when doing a holistic analysis of a monster.": "如果有的话，传奇抗性的有效HP也很少（取决于CR有多高）。我个人认为，传奇抗性是怪物等级的延伸（即BOSS怪物在单挑时几乎都应该有传奇抗性），所以我只有在对怪物进行整体分析时才真正考虑到它们。",
	"Potent conditions such as {@condition paralyzed} and {@condition stunned} can have a significant influence on a given fight, but they don't deal direct damage, so the official books somewhat imply that they shouldn't be accounted for. However, if this were the case, monsters like the ghoul or ghast that inflict such conditions would have a much lower CR. In reality, WotC weighs these powerful conditions as \"virtual damage\". They find the lowest level spell that inflicts this condition (e.g. {@spell hold person}), and they compare it to another spell of the same level (e.g. {@spell scorching ray}). In this case, {@spell scorching ray} deals an average of 21 ({@damage 6d6}) damage, so this is the \"virtual damage\" that the {@condition paralyzed} condition is worth.": "诸如{@condition paralyzed}和{@condition stunned}这样的强力条件可以对特定的战斗产生重大影响，但它们并不造成直接伤害，因此官方书籍在某种程度上暗示它们不应该被计算在内。然而，如果是这样的话，像食尸鬼或兽人这样造成这种状况的怪物的CR会低得多。在现实中，WotC将这些强大的条件作为 \"虚拟伤害 \"来衡量。他们找到造成这种状况的最低等级的法术（例如（%2%）），并将其与同等级的另一个法术（例如（%3%））进行比较。在这个例子中，{@spell scorching ray}平均造成21({@damage 6d6})的伤害，所以这就是{@condition paralyzed}条件的 \"虚拟伤害\"。",
	"That said, you don't necessarily have to do this math every time: you can try to quantify them in some other manner (as described in an upcoming section), or you can simply consider these conditions during the holistic consideration of the monster's balance.": "也就是说，你不一定每次都要做这样的计算：你可以尝试用其他方式来量化它们（正如即将到来的章节中所描述的那样），或者你可以在全面考虑怪物的平衡时简单地考虑这些条件。",
	"Damage resistances and immunities are not worth as much as the DMG claims. This specifically applies to resistance or immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Either it halves or entirely negates a martial player's physical contributions, or it is rendered irrelevant by magic weapons. Given the existence of Ki-Empowered Strikes and other class and subclass features that are similar to it, it is reasonable to assume that players are supposed to get weapons that count as magical at some point in the game (although these weapons needn't grant any other benefit beyond bypassing physical resistances and immunities). Thus, I opt to ignore these resistances or immunities when it feels safe to do so (e.g. it is fine for high CR demon lords, but it must be considered when making low CR incorporeal undead), viewing it more as something that contributes to a monster's narrative power level more than anything else.": "伤害抵抗和免疫的价值并不像DMG所说的那么大。这特别适用于对来自非魔法攻击的重击、穿刺和砍击伤害的抵抗或免疫。它要么是将武者的物理贡献减半或完全否定，要么是被魔法武器变得不重要了。鉴于Ki-Empowered Strikes和其他与之相似的等级和子等级特征的存在，我们有理由认为玩家应该在游戏中的某个时刻得到算作魔法的武器（尽管这些武器除了绕过物理抗性和免疫外，不需要给予任何其他好处）。因此，在感觉安全的情况下，我选择忽略这些抵抗力或免疫力（例如，对于高CR的恶魔领主来说，这很好，但在制作低CR的无体亡灵时，必须考虑它），更多地将其视为有助于怪物的叙事能力水平的东西，而不是其他东西。",
	"Let's take a page from the Blog of Holding (see below) by presenting the DMG's quick monster stats in the form of a set of mathematical formulas. Note that these formulas have some wiggle room in them, and are slightly less accurate than the DMG rules.": "让我们借鉴《持有者的博客》（见下文）的做法，以一套数学公式的形式介绍DMG的快速怪物统计。请注意，这些公式有一些回旋的余地，而且比DMG的规则略为不准确。",
	"For the purpose of these formulas, treat fractional CRs as negative integers: 1/2 is 0, 1/4 is -1, 1/8 is -2, and 0 is -3.": "为了这些公式的目的，将分数CR视为负整数：1/2为0，1/4为-1，1/8为-2，0为-3。",

	"Whenever I make a monster, I find an official stat block that fits a similar role in combat and take inspiration from its ability scores, hit points, and its average damage per round (DPR). For example, if I am making a CR 10 monster that is large and physically powerful, I might take a look at the Stone Golem from the {@book Monster Manual|mm} and borrow its hit points, AC, Strength and Constitution scores, and some other traits as I see fit. If I don't want my monster to have damage resistances or immunities, I may want to increase its HP compared to the Stone Golem, as the golem has some potent damage immunities that contribute to its defenses.": "每当我制作一个怪物时，我都会找到一个适合在战斗中扮演类似角色的官方数据块，并从其能力得分、命中率和每回合平均伤害（DPR）中获得灵感。例如，如果我正在制作一个CR10的怪物，它体型庞大，身体强壮，我可能会看一下《%0%》中的石像，并借用它的命中率、AC、力量和体质分数，以及一些我认为合适的其他特征。如果我不希望我的怪物有伤害抵抗力或免疫力，我可能要比石像鬼增加它的HP，因为石像鬼有一些有力的伤害免疫力，有助于它的防御。",
	"This approach allows me to make a monster that is properly balanced based on WotC's in-house formula, without actually having to do any heavy math beyond \"increase this\" and \"decrease that\". After all, WotC already did the math when they made the original monster you are taking inspiration from. And whenever I need to make adjustments, I just use the official CR guidelines to appropriately balance them.": "这种方法允许我根据WotC的内部公式制作一个适当平衡的怪物，而实际上除了 \"增加这个 \"和 \"减少那个 \"之外，不需要做任何繁重的数学运算。毕竟，WotC在制作你所借鉴的原始怪物时已经做了数学计算。而每当我需要进行调整时，我只需使用官方的CR指南来适当地平衡它们。",
	"The {@link 5e Monster Manual on a Business Card|https://blogofholding.com/?p=7338} page has statistical approximations of the formulas used to create monsters by the books.

	"The default business card provides a formula that allows one to approximate the total bonus a monster's best saving throw should get based on CR. However, this doesn't tell us how many saving throws the monster should receive bonuses to, which is arguably more important; as most saving throw bonuses take the form of proficiency in that save, having a recommended bonus for a monster's best saving throw really just tells us what kind of ability scores the monster should get.": "默认的名片提供了一个公式，允许人们根据CR估算出一个怪物的最佳救赎应该得到的总奖励。然而，这并没有告诉我们怪物应该得到多少次救赎的奖励，这可以说是更重要的；因为大多数救赎的奖励都是以熟练掌握该救赎的形式出现的，为怪物的最佳救赎提供一个推荐的奖励实际上只是告诉我们怪物应该得到什么样的能力分数。",
	"As discussed in a later section, a save proficiency is worth a boost of DCR +1/2 for every proficiency beyond two.

	"A lot of this stuff is certainly interesting and should exist in 5e in some capacity. But there are a lot of issues surrounding {@b compatibility}.

	"That said, not everyone is {@b experienced} with monster homebrew and D&D in general. While this system's freeform nature allows for some creative applications, it also means that a new DM might be more confused than if they were to stick with the official monsters and monster math provided in the core books. After all, monsters in 5e are spelled out they way they are so that they can be used in play with minimal editing and work on the part of the DM.

No matter why you're here, this document is designed to be compatible with base 5e, to present content for inexperienced and experienced DMs alike, and to allow you to pick and choose what you want to use from it.": "就个人而言，我喜欢GiffyGlyph的很多想法，但我是挑战等级和官方怪物背后的一般数学的粉丝。因此，我为你采取了第二种选择，将他的很多想法插入本文件中。在制作这个文件时，我也考虑到了模块化的问题--也许你在这里只想了解遭遇战的平衡规则，也许你只关心后面介绍的BOSS战变种。你们中的一些人可能只关心附录中的状态块。无论你为什么来到这里，这份文件都是为了与基础5e兼容，为没有经验和有经验的管理员提供内容，并允许你从中挑选你想使用的内容。",
	"The DMG has plenty of information on the effects of certain traits and features on a monster's Challenge Rating. These effects are mostly phrased in terms of effective HP, effective attack bonus, effective AC, etcetera. But if all of these were translated into their direct effects on a monster's CR, while also making adjustments to inaccurate information, perhaps it would be easier to parse.": "DMG中有很多关于某些特性和特征对怪物挑战等级的影响的信息。这些影响大多是以有效HP、有效攻击加成、有效AC等术语来表述的。但如果所有这些都被翻译成对怪物CR的直接影响，同时对不准确的信息进行调整，也许会更容易解析。",
	"When reading this section, remember that Challenge Rating is a median, rather than an actual average. Adding 1 to a monster's OCR or DCR is equivalent to moving one row down on the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table in the DMG. Additionally, if you are left with a fractional value for CR, you are free to round up or down as appropriate.": "阅读本节时，请记住，挑战等级是一个中位数，而不是一个实际的平均值。在怪物的OCR或DCR上加1，相当于在DMG的怪物统计表上按挑战等级下移一行。此外，如果你留下了一个小数的CR值，你可以根据情况自由地向上或向下取整。",
	"Finally, know that I don't personally use most of the information in the tables below, but some of you might find them useful depending on how you prefer to make monsters.": "最后，要知道我个人并不使用以下表格中的大部分信息，但你们中的一些人可能会发现它们很有用，这取决于你们喜欢如何制造怪物。",
	"In order to make this translation, we can recognize that most traits either increase a monster's effective attack bonus or its effective armor class. In turn, the DMG says that when a monster's effective AC or attack bonus is 2 points too high (or low), its DCR or OCR (respectively) becomes 1 point higher (or lower). In other words, traits like Magic Resistance that add +2 to a monster's effective AC directly increase the monster's DCR by 1. We can summarize these essential statistics as follows:": "为了进行这种翻译，我们可以认识到，大多数特性要么增加怪物的有效攻击加成，要么增加其有效护甲等级。反过来，DMG说，当一个怪物的有效AC或攻击加成过高（或过低）2点时，它的DCR或OCR（分别）就会高（或低）1点。换句话说，像魔抗这样的特质会使怪物的有效AC值增加+2，直接使怪物的DCR增加1。 我们可以将这些基本的统计数据总结如下。",

	"Effective Attack Bonus/Save DC +2": "有效攻击奖励/拯救DC +2",
	"Save proficiencies": "储蓄的熟练程度",

	"Consistent advantage on a save": "拯救时的持续优势",
	"Counts as an extra save proficiency": "算作是额外的救赎熟练度",
	"As discussed earlier, WotC often treats conditions as dealing \"virtual damage\" to a monster. Because damage scales linearly with OCR, and because conditions are equally relevant at all levels, we can take this one step further by translating this \"virtual damage\" into increments of a monster's CR.": "如前所述，WotC通常将条件视为对怪物的 \"虚拟伤害\"。因为伤害与OCR呈线性关系，而且条件在所有等级中都是同等重要的，所以我们可以更进一步，将这种 \"虚拟伤害 \"转化为怪物CR的增量。",
	"Conditions that make it easier to attack a creature (e.g. {@condition stunned}) add to a monster's OCR. Conditions that only make it harder for a creature to attack (e.g. {@condition poisoned}) add to a monster's DCR. Both effects are derived by comparing the spells that inflict them (e.g. {@condition frightened} or {@condition paralyzed}) to equivalent spells of the same level (e.g. {@spell shield of faith} or {@spell scorching ray}), or to equivalent effects on a single monster that can inflict such conditions (e.g. a beholder's eye rays).": "使生物更容易被攻击的条件（例如：{@condition stunned}）会增加到怪物的OCR。只使生物更难攻击的条件（例如：{@condition poisoned}）会增加怪物的DCR。这两种效果都是通过比较造成它们的法术（例如{@condition frightened}或{@condition paralyzed}）与同等级的同等法术（例如{@spell shield of faith}或{@spell scorching ray}），或与能造成这种条件的单一怪物的同等效果（例如beholder's eye rays）而得出。",
	"Assume that each condition below only targets one creature, and can be imposed once every round. If a condition is applied in an area of effect, you can assume that it will apply to two creatures, allowing you to double the effect on CR listed below. If a condition isn't listed, its effect on CR is negligible or otherwise isn't worth quantifying.": "假设下面的每个条件只针对一个生物，并且每回合可以施加一次。如果一个条件是在一个效应区域内施加的，你可以假设它将适用于两个生物，从而使你可以将下面列出的对CR的影响加倍。如果一个条件没有列出，它对CR的影响可以忽略不计，或者不值得量化。",

	"Now that we have all of this information, let's make a new version of the Monster Features table on DMG 280. First, we can add extra traits like Improved Critical to the list. Next, we can translate each feature's effect on Challenge Rating to its fractional effect on CR using the tables above. Finally, we can also make one or two adjustments to these effects based on the discussions in the previous sections.": "现在我们有了所有这些信息，让我们在DMG 280上制作一个新版的怪物特征表。首先，我们可以在列表中增加一些额外的特征，如改进的关键性。接下来，我们可以用上面的表格将每个特征对挑战等级的影响转化为对CR的分数影响。最后，我们还可以根据前面几节的讨论，对这些效果做一到两个调整。",
	"In general, {@b a feature's effect on CR weakens as the monster's CR goes up.} A trait like Magic Resistance is a strong feature for a CR 3 bearded devil to have, but it is reasonable to expect that a CR 21 creature like a solar would have access to it. This mirrors the fact that for any given party, balance tends to be thrown out the window once they reach the fourth tier of play.": "一般来说，{@b a feature's effect on CR weakens as the monster's CR goes up.}像魔力抵抗这样的特性对于一个CR 3的胡须魔鬼来说是一个很强的特性，但我们有理由期待一个CR 21的生物，如太阳能，可以获得它。这反映了这样一个事实：对于任何一方来说，一旦达到第四层的游戏，平衡往往就会被抛出窗外。",

	"If the monster is {@condition incapacitated} at the start of its turn, the effect causing this condition immediately ends on the monster.": "如果该怪兽在其回合开始时是（％0％），则导致该怪兽的这个条件的效果立即结束。",
	"To make certain fights more epic and cool, you can give your monsters access to lair actions. Lair actions are special powers that certain monsters can use to manipulate the lair they reside in. For example, an ancient red dragon can cause magma and volcanic gases to erupt within its lair, while Orcus can cause corpses within the lair to animate as undead. Not only do these powers add to the presentation of the fight, but they also influence the action economy by allowing a monster that has them to do more from round to round.": "为了使某些战斗更加史诗化和酷炫，你可以让你的怪物拥有巢穴行动的权限。巢穴行动是某些怪物可以用来操纵它们所居住的巢穴的特殊力量。例如，一条古老的红龙可以使岩浆和火山气体在它的巢穴中喷发，而半兽人可以使巢穴中的尸体变成亡灵。这些力量不仅增加了战斗的表现力，而且还影响了行动的经济性，使拥有这些力量的怪物能够在各个回合中做得更多。",
	"That said, just like legendary actions (see below), lair actions needn't be restricted to boss fights, high CR monsters, or even to lairs in general. For example, the lair action system can be used to quantify the spread of fire due to a rampaging squad of rogue fire elementals, which lacks all three of these qualities. In other cases, you can even just have environmental shifts (e.g. the effects of a natural earthquake) occur on initiative count 20 of each round, which is the equivalent of a lair action that isn't even taken by a monster at all.": "也就是说，就像传说中的行动（见下文）一样，巢穴行动不需要局限于BOSS战、高CR怪物，甚至不需要局限于一般的巢穴。例如，巢穴行动系统可以用来量化由于流氓火元素小队的横冲直撞而造成的火势蔓延，而这三个方面都缺乏。在其他情况下，你甚至可以让环境转变（例如自然地震的影响）在每轮的主动权计数20时发生，这相当于一个巢穴行动，而怪物根本就没有采取这种行动。",
	"The \"lair actions without a lair\" concept might sound strange at first, but can actually be used quite well in boss fights and other climactic scenarios. Many official monsters have lair actions that don't necessarily manipulate their lair itself; for example, both of {@creature Zariel|mtf}'s lair actions boil down to her casting some sort of spell. While the lack of a lair dependency is arguably a form of bad design (an argument I won't disagree with), this independence also allows you to use these lair actions even when it is outside of its lair or it doesn't have a lair in the first place. Remember that while this might work for some monsters, it might not work with the ones that directly manipulate their lair via their lair actions.": "\"没有巢穴的巢穴行动 \"的概念一开始可能听起来很奇怪，但实际上在BOSS战和其他高潮场景中可以用得很好。许多官方怪物的巢穴行动并不一定要操纵它们的巢穴本身；例如，{@creature Zariel|mtf}的两个巢穴行动都归结为她施展某种法术。虽然缺乏巢穴依赖性可以说是一种糟糕的设计（这个论点我不会反对），但这种独立性也允许你使用这些巢穴行动，即使它在巢穴之外或者它本来就没有巢穴。请记住，虽然这可能对某些怪物有效，但对那些通过巢穴行动直接操纵它们的巢穴的怪物来说可能就不适用了。",
	"In general, whenever a monster uses a lair action, one or more of the following effects can occur:": "一般来说，每当一个怪物使用巢穴动作时，就会发生以下一种或多种效果。",
	"The monster causes the lair to shift and transform, such as destroying all its exits or erecting a new wall.": "怪物导致巢穴转移和转变，例如破坏其所有的出口或竖起一堵新墙。",
	"A hazardous terrain feature in the lair is activated or takes effect.": "巢穴中的一个危险地形特征被激活或生效。",
	"The monster grants its allies some sort of buff or allows them to take some sort of an additional action.": "怪物给予它的盟友某种BUFF，或者允许他们采取某种额外的行动。",
	"One spell or effect on the monster immediately ends.": "怪物身上的一个法术或效果立即结束。",
	"The monster creates or summons new allies to fight alongside it.": "怪物创造或召唤新的盟友与它并肩作战。",
	"All hostile creatures in the lair suffer some sort of detrimental condition (save resists).": "巢穴中的所有敌对生物都会受到某种不利条件的影响（保存抵抗力）。",
	"The monster casts an innate spell that is often (but not always) incapable of dealing damage.": "怪物施放的先天性法术通常（但并非总是）无法造成伤害。",
	"The effects of an ongoing ritual take place.": "一个正在进行的仪式的效果发生了。",
	"Additionally, consider using the following ability to enhance a monster's capability to use lair actions.": "此外，可以考虑使用以下能力来增强怪物使用巢穴行动的能力。",
	"On initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), the monster takes a lair action.": "在主动权计数10时（失去主动权的平局），怪物会采取一个巢穴行动。",
	"Legendary actions are special abilities that some monsters can use outside of their normal turn in combat. They have a set number of legendary actions per round, and they can spend them on various effects that interupt the normal initiative order.": "传奇行动是一些怪物在战斗中正常回合之外可以使用的特殊能力。它们每回合有一定数量的传奇行动，它们可以将这些行动用于打断正常主动权顺序的各种效果。",
	"Legendary actions are typically used to balance out the action economy when a boss-like monster is alone in their fight against the adventuring party. However, even if a monster is of a low CR and is not strong relative to other legendary creatures in the world, giving them legendary actions can still make the fight against them that much more fun and challenging.": "传奇行动通常用于平衡行动经济，当一个类似于BOSS的怪物单独与冒险队伍作战时。然而，即使一个怪物的CR很低，相对于世界上其他传奇生物来说并不强大，给他们传奇行动仍然可以使与他们的战斗更加有趣和具有挑战性。",
	"When designing legendary actions for your monsters, keep the following tips in mind:": "在为你的怪物设计传奇动作时，请记住以下提示。",
	"Remember that the damage dealt by a monster's legendary actions contributes to their total damage per round. This can stack up quickly, so try not to make a legendary action that is both spammable and powerful. Furthermore, note that most monsters have three legendary actions per round, but some extraordinarily powerful monsters (e.g. Tiamat) can have five of them.": "请记住，怪物的传奇行动所造成的伤害是对其每回合总伤害的贡献。这可能很快就会叠加起来，所以尽量不要做一个既容易被攻击又强大的传奇行动。此外，请注意，大多数怪物每回合有三个传奇行动，但有些特别强大的怪物（如提亚马特）可以有五个传奇行动。",
	"If a monster just repeats the same attack three times using their legendary actions, then what's the point of having them at all? As legendary actions can be used whenever a creature ends its turn, they should be designed in a way that allows certain actions to be used in certain situations. For example, many creatures often have a legendary action that lets them move, which can be used to reposition, to retreat when in a bad situation, or to give chase when in a good situation. The use of this legendary action must be weighed against the other options: for example, an Attack legendary action that will increase their offensive power accordingly.": "如果一个怪物只是用他们的传奇行动重复相同的攻击三次，那么拥有它们的意义何在？由于传奇行动可以在生物结束其回合时使用，它们应该被设计成允许在特定情况下使用某些行动。例如，许多生物通常都有一个可以让它们移动的传奇行动，这可以用来重新定位，在糟糕的情况下撤退，或者在好的情况下进行追击。使用这个传奇动作必须与其他选项进行权衡：例如，攻击的传奇动作会相应增加它们的攻击力。",
	"While it is okay to have a monster who uses each of their legendary actions one at a time, another way to add variety is to create options that cost multiple legendary actions to use. This allows for powerful abilities to be used outside of a monster's turn without allowing them to be spammed repeatedly. For example, you might give a spellcaster the ability to Cast a Spell as a legendary action, but using this ability would cost two legendary actions at once. The most extreme situations involve powers that cost three legendary actions at once, which typically a monster's entire budget per round.": "虽然让一个怪物一次使用他们的每一个传奇行动是可以的，但增加多样性的另一种方法是创建需要花费多个传奇行动才能使用的选项。这使得强大的能力可以在怪物的回合之外使用，而不至于让它们被重复使用。例如，你可以给一个施法者提供施法的能力，作为一个传奇行动，但使用这个能力会同时花费两个传奇行动。最极端的情况是一次花费三个传奇行动的能力，这通常是一个怪物每回合的全部预算。",
	"Remember that while these costly abilities should be more powerful than the others, they shouldn't necessarily be the best choice in all situations. While some abilities might be considered the \"default\" options, they should all be comparable enough where choosing between them involves some sort of opportunity cost.": "记住，虽然这些昂贵的能力应该比其他能力更强大，但它们不一定是所有情况下的最佳选择。虽然有些能力可能被认为是 \"默认 \"的选择，但它们都应该有足够的可比性，在它们之间的选择涉及某种机会成本。",
	"Legendary actions aren't just sorted alphabetically. All options are sorted in an ascending manner based on how many legendary actions they cost, and within each tier, they are sorted alphabetically. Then, utility legendary actions such as Detect, Move, and {@action Use an Object} that don't have any direct offensive or defensive power are moved to the top, unless such options cost more than one legendary actions.": "传奇行动并不只是按字母顺序排序的。所有选项都是根据其花费的传奇行动的多少以升序方式排序的，在每一层中，它们是按字母顺序排序的。然后，实用的传奇行动，如探测、移动和（%0%），没有任何直接的进攻或防御力量，会被移到最上面，除非这样的选项花费超过一个传奇行动。",
	"Not all monsters will have the same type of legendary actions. Some legendary actions will enable them to enter melee range and to smash their foes into the ground. Others will boost their defensive power of both themselves and their allies. A few of them even let a monster teleport across the battlefield and activate powerful magical or psionic abilities.": "不是所有的怪物都会有相同类型的传奇行动。一些传奇行动将使它们能够进入近战范围，并将它们的敌人砸到地上。其他的则会提高自己和盟友的防御力。有一些甚至可以让怪物在战场上传送，并激活强大的魔法或幻觉能力。",
	"You should customize a monster's legendary actions based on their role in combat. Below are a few example legendary actions that you can use for each role.": "你应该根据怪物在战斗中的作用来定制它们的传奇行动。下面是一些传奇动作的例子，你可以为每个角色使用。",

	"A mythic trait that details the monster's optional \"second phase\". Instead of dying at 0 HP, it regains all of its hit points, or it otherwise triggers a mechanic that grants them that many effecitve hit points. This also leaves room for the monster to immediately take some sort of movement and/or action. This trait typically recharges after a short or long rest, but might not recharge at all if it is a permanent transformation.": "一个神话般的特性，详细说明了怪物的可选 \"第二阶段\"。它不会在0HP时死亡，而是重新获得所有的命中率，或者以其他方式触发一个机制，赋予它们那么多的有效命中率。这也为怪物立即采取某种运动和/或行动留下了空间。这种特性通常会在短期或长期的休息后充能，但如果是永久性转化，则可能根本不会充能。",
	"With this mythic trait comes a list of mythic actions. Mythic actions are new legendary action options that the monster gains access to once their mythic trait is triggered. These legendary actions are generally more powerful than their old ones, but they still retain access to their old ones if needed. Mythic actions are typically available for 1 hour after the mythic trait is triggered, but this can be changed to fit a particular monster's circumstances.": "伴随着这个神话特性的是一个神话行动列表。神话行动是新的传奇行动选项，一旦他们的神话特性被触发，怪物就能获得这些行动。这些传奇行动通常比它们的旧行动更强大，但如果需要的话，它们仍然可以使用它们的旧行动。神话行动通常在神话特性被触发后的1小时内可用，但这一时间可以根据特定怪物的情况而改变。",
	"Here are some variants of this system that you can use for your mythic monsters.": "下面是这个系统的一些变种，你可以用在你的神话怪物身上。",
	"In addition to gaining new legendary actions, you can also give a mythic monster access to new traits and abilities when their mythic trait is active. For example, if you want to give a monster Limited Magic Immunity during its second phase, you can label this trait as \"Limited Magic Immunity (Mythic Form Only)\". If you want a monster to lose access to a feature, such as a Frightful Presence action, you can instead label it as \"Frightful Presence (Original Form Only)\". This notation is similar to features that are restricted to a shapechanger's specific forms, such as those of a {@creature werewolf}.": "除了获得新的传奇行动外，你还可以让神话怪物在其神话特质激活时获得新的特质和能力。例如，如果你想在一个怪物的第二阶段赋予它有限的魔法免疫力，你可以将这个特性标记为 \"有限的魔法免疫力（仅限神话形态）\"。如果你想让一个怪物失去对某一特性的使用权，比如 \"可怕的存在 \"行动，你可以将其标记为 \"可怕的存在（仅限原始形态）\"。这种标记类似于仅限于变形者的特定形态的特征，比如（%0%）的特征。",
	"You can also grant a mythic monster an extra action on its turn each round called a \"mythic maneuver\". Note that this extra action might be oppressive if it isn't heavily restricted. I would personally recommend restricting this maneuver to be strictly utility-based (e.g. the {@action Dash} or {@action Disengage} action), but if proper restrictions are applied, damage-based abilities should be fine as well (e.g. one weapon attack only).": "你也可以在每个回合的回合中给予神话怪兽一个额外的行动，称为 \"神话演习\"。请注意，如果没有严格的限制，这种额外的行动可能会造成压迫。我个人建议将这种演习严格限制为基于效用的演习（例如（%0%）或（%1%）的行动），但如果应用了适当的限制，基于伤害的能力也应该是不错的（例如，只能进行一次武器攻击）。",
	"A similar concept applies to reactions: you can grant the monster an additional reaction slot, or access to a trait like Reactive, while its mythic trait is active.": "类似的概念也适用于反应：你可以赋予怪物一个额外的反应槽，或者在它的神话特性处于活动状态时获得一个类似于反应性的特性。",
	"Want to have a monster with more than just two phases? Label its mythic trait with multiple uses per day, and that's all you need to do. That said, such a monster will be much stronger than a normal mythic monster, which is already very strong compared to a normal legendary monster. With this in mind, perhaps the monster's transformations shouldn't restore all of its hit points, or perhaps the monster should have less hit points to begin with.": "想让一个怪物不止有两个阶段吗？给它的神话特性加上每天多次使用的标签，这就是你需要做的。也就是说，这样的怪物将比普通的神话级怪物强得多，与普通的传奇级怪物相比，它已经非常强大了。考虑到这一点，也许怪物的变身不应该恢复它所有的命中率，或者也许怪物一开始就应该有更少的命中率。",

If it is forced to make a saving throw, treat its ability scores as 10 ({@dice 1d20|+0}). If the monster finishes a short or long rest, the monster heals, any destroyed weak points regenerate, and the weak points are covered again.

Otherwise, this form uses the monster's normal statistics.": "如果怪物的命中率降至0，它不会死亡或倒下（%0%）。相反，它恢复了所有的命中率，并永久地转化为第二个形态。这个形态对所有的条件都免疫，在所有的蓄力攻击中都有优势，并且每当它用武器攻击时都会造成额外的7（%1%）的伤害。否则，这个形态会使用怪物的正常统计数据。",

	"If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall {@condition unconscious}. Instead, it regains all of its hit points, and it regains one spell slot of 8th level or lower, as well as one use of its Legendary Resistance feature.": "如果怪物的命中率降至0，它不会死亡或倒下（%0%）。相反，它恢复了所有的命中率，并且恢复了一个8级或更低的法术槽，以及一次使用其传奇抵抗特性。",
	"The traits and abilities below are examples of other features you can use tohook into the mythic monster system.": "下面的特征和能力是你可以用来与神话怪物系统挂钩的其他特征的例子。",

	"While the monster's mythic trait is active, it gains an additional action it can use on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, {@action Hide}, {@action Search}, or {@action Use an Object} action.": "当怪物的神话特性处于活动状态时，它获得一个额外的行动，可以在它的每个回合中使用。该行动只能用于采取（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）、（%3%）或（%4%）的行动。",

	"A classic trope is that of boss phases: at some point(s) during the battle, the boss changes its form or gains powerful abilities that weren't used during the first part of the fight. Boss phases continue the tension and excitement of a fight by granting a boss new abilities, allowing it to break free from a detrimental effect, or otherwise changing the circumstances of the battle.": "一个经典的套路是老板阶段：在战斗中的某些时候，老板改变了它的形式或获得了强大的能力，在战斗的第一部分没有使用。老板阶段通过赋予老板新的能力，使其摆脱不利影响，或以其他方式改变战斗的环境，从而继续保持战斗的紧张和兴奋。",
	"Most phase changes take place when a monster is reduced to a certain HP threshold. For exampe, the {@b bloodied} condition, which takes effect when a monster is reduced to half of its hit points or fewer, is a popular descriptor used in 4th Edition. By attaching mechanics to this descriptor (e.g. automatically recharging an action), you can be used to transform fights with even the simplest of monsters into exciting challenges that have an unexpected twist halfway through the fight.": "大多数阶段性变化发生在怪物被减少到某个HP阈值的时候。例如，{@b bloodied}条件在怪物被减至一半或更少命中率时生效，是第四版中常用的描述符。通过在这个描述符上附加机制（例如自动充能动作），可以用来将与最简单的怪物的战斗转变为令人兴奋的挑战，在战斗的中途出现意想不到的转折。",
	"With that in mind, feel free to add your own phases as you see fit; for example, you can have a monster change phases at every third or fourth of its hit points.": "考虑到这一点，你可以随意添加你认为合适的阶段；例如，你可以让一个怪物在其每三分之一或四分之一的命中率上改变阶段。",
	"You can also have a phase transition occur when a monster is reduced to 0 hit points. When this occurs, it will typically": "你也可以让一个怪物的命中率降至0时发生相位转换。当这种情况发生时，它通常会",
	"Meanwhile, some phase changes might occur due to external forces. For example, perhaps an aspiring necromancer is currently undergoing the transformation into a lich, but the party has barged in and is attempting to stop the ritual from completing. When this is the case, a phase change typically occurs when some milestone in the ritual is reached, such as its halfway point or its full interuption. To manage such a fight, keep track of how many rounds have gone by, relative to the duration required for the ritual to complete.": "同时，有些阶段性变化可能是由于外部力量造成的。例如，也许一个有抱负的死灵法师目前正在经历向巫师的转变，但当事人闯入并试图阻止仪式的完成。在这种情况下，当仪式达到某个里程碑时，通常会发生阶段性变化，比如仪式进行到一半时或完全中断时。为了管理这样的战斗，请记录已经过去了多少个回合，相对于仪式完成所需的时间。",
	"Whenever a monster changes phases, one or more of the following effects can occur:": "每当一个怪物改变相位时，就会发生以下一种或多种效果。",
	"The monster ends all detrimental conditions and effects on itself": "怪物结束所有对自己不利的条件和影响",
	"The monster recharges or regains uses of one or more of its abilities": "该怪物为其一种或多种能力充能或重新获得使用。",

	"Matt Colville's {@link Action Oriented Combat|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_zl8WWaSyI} video extensively discusses homebrew rules and guidelines for boss fights. The discussion boils down to the following ideas regarding \"Action Oriented Monsters\" (AO monsters):": "马特-科尔维尔（%0%）的视频广泛地讨论了自制规则和BOSS战的准则。讨论归结为以下关于 \"行动导向的怪物\"（AO怪物）的想法。",
	"AO monsters should have access to regular actions, bonus actions, and reactions, as well as \"villain actions\". These abilities should all be diverse and unique in nature, rather than all of them just being some sort of weapon attack.": "AO怪兽应该有机会获得常规行动、奖励行动和反应，以及 \"反派行动\"。这些能力在性质上都应该是多样化和独特的，而不是所有这些能力都只是某种武器攻击。",
	"Villain actions, in Colville's words, are once-per-round legendary actions that are \"scripted\" in nature. That is, specific villain actions are set to be used on certain rounds in combat, meaning that they are scripted to be used in a certain order.": "用科尔维尔的话说，反派行动是每回合一次的传奇行动，具有 \"脚本 \"的性质。也就是说，特定的反派行动被设定为在战斗中的某些回合使用，也就是说，它们被编入剧本，以一定的顺序使用。",
	"Some of the {@b finer details} are also important to remember:": "一些{@b finer details}也是需要记住的。",
	"Even if there is more than one AO monster on the field, one villain action being used per round is enough. The monsters can share villain actions, or you can pick and choose (or just write out from the start) which monster gets to use their villain action each round.": "即使场上有不止一只AO怪兽，每轮使用一个反派行动也足够了。怪物们可以共享反派行动，或者你可以选择（或者从一开始就写出）每轮哪个怪物可以使用他们的反派行动。",
	"Adhering to traditional game mechanics is fine, but the point of this free-form system is to allow for abilities to exist without having to justify them beyond \"because it's cool\". Monsters shouldn't have the same limitations as PCs do, so they should be able to do whatever the DM wants them to (unless it is unfair or doesn't make any sense).": "遵循传统的游戏机制是不错的，但这个自由形式的系统的重点是允许能力的存在，而不需要证明它们是 \"因为它很酷\"。怪物不应该有和个人一样的限制，所以它们应该能够做任何DM想让它们做的事情（除非它不公平或没有任何意义）。",
	"What {@b lessons} can we learn from this and apply to our general knowledge of official monster making rules? Let's see:": "我们可以从中学习到什么（%0%），并应用于我们对官方怪物制作规则的一般知识？让我们来看看。",
	"Game mechanics are ultimately the vehicle through which the narrative is delivered. Don't let the rules of the system hold you back from creating powers that are cool and exciting (unless they are unfair to your players, of course). Monsters aren't built like player characters are, so they don't have to follow the same rules to determine what powers they get and how much they can use them. The only limit here is how you choose to design the monster.": "游戏机制最终是传递叙事的载体。不要让系统的规则阻碍你创造很酷很刺激的力量（当然，除非它们对你的玩家不公平）。怪物并不像玩家角色那样，所以它们不必遵循同样的规则来决定它们得到什么力量以及它们能使用多少力量。这里唯一的限制是你选择如何设计怪物。",
	"In order to engage your players with an important monster, the monster can't be static in its actions. By creating a diverse set of monster abilities where there isn't an option that is objectively the best to use throughout the majority of the fight, you have an encounter whose pacing, excitement, and dramatic tension is much better than that a static encounter.": "为了让你的玩家参与到一个重要的怪物中，这个怪物的行动不能是静态的。通过创造一套多样化的怪物能力，在整个战斗的大部分时间里，没有一个选项是客观上最好的，你的遭遇战的节奏、兴奋度和戏剧张力都比静态遭遇战要好得多。",
	"If there is more than one legendary monster on the field, you might want to condense their legendary action options into one pool of legendary actions to track. These abilities should be more powerful than a single monster's legendary actions, as they represent the firepower of multiple monsters at once. For an official example of this, see the Obzedat Ghost stat block (GGR 245). The same idea applies to lair actions: if two legendary monsters share a lair, it might be wise to use one list of (possibly empowered) lair actions.": "如果场上有不止一只传奇怪兽，你可能想将它们的传奇行动选项浓缩到一个传奇行动池中来追踪。这些能力应该比单个怪兽的传奇行动更强大，因为它们同时代表了多个怪兽的火力。关于这一点的官方例子，请参见Obzedat Ghost状态块（GGR 245）。同样的想法也适用于巢穴行动：如果两个传奇怪物共享一个巢穴，那么使用一个巢穴行动列表（可能是授权的）可能是明智的。",
	"AO monsters seem pretty cool. That, are there any {@b flaws} to this approach?": "AO的怪物似乎相当酷。那，这种做法有没有（%0%）？",
	"If you make AO monsters for yourself, that sounds pretty great. However, if you make monsters to be published/used by others, using a homebrew approach to monster making might be incompatible with many DMs's games. This applies to all homebrew monster creation methods, it applies here in particular because if you are publishing your monsters publically, you can accomplish much of what Colville sought to do with this method via the use of pre-existing game mechanics.": "如果你为自己制作AO怪兽，这听起来相当不错。但是，如果你制作的怪物要被别人出版/使用，使用自制的怪物制作方法可能与许多DM的游戏不兼容。这适用于所有自制怪物的方法，在这里尤其适用，因为如果你公开发布你的怪物，你可以通过使用预先存在的游戏机制来完成科尔维尔用这种方法所要做的大部分事情。",
	"AO monsters are designed with the goal of being dynamic, but the way they are set up might just encourage the opposite. While villain actions are like regular lair actions in that they can be used after a specific player's turn, the scripted order in which they are used makes it harder for a monster to adapt to a given situation. For example, the AO Goblin Boss's \"Focus Fire\" villain action, which allows the Boss's goblin minions to immediately move towards one creature of the Boss's choice, might not make sense to use when the current fight involves sniping the party from range and then immediately using Nimble Escape to hide again. Yet, the Goblin Boss is forced to either use the ability anyway, which is a suboptimal tactical decision, or to not to use the ability at all, which makes the whole system pointless. With legendary actions, there will always be some option that can be used by the monster in any given situation.": "AO怪物的设计目标是动态的，但它们的设置方式可能正好鼓励了相反的情况。虽然小人行动与普通的巢穴行动一样，可以在特定玩家的回合后使用，但使用这些行动的脚本顺序使怪物更难适应特定的情况。例如，AO哥布林老板的 \"集中火力 \"小人行动，允许老板的哥布林爪牙立即向老板选择的一个生物移动，当当前的战斗涉及从范围内狙击党，然后立即使用敏捷逃亡再次隐藏时，使用该行动可能没有意义。然而，哥布林老板被迫要么使用这个能力，这是一个次优的战术决定，要么根本不使用这个能力，这使得整个系统毫无意义。有了传说中的行动，总会有一些选项可以让怪物在任何特定情况下使用。",
	"Building off of the previous point, villain actions only being usable once per round can sometimes be less exciting and fast-paced than being able to use multiple legendary actions per round. While the individual legendary actions might not be as strong, being able to actually respond to the party's actions multiple times per round (beyond the monster's reaction) can make a solo fight much more challenging than. Besides, you can always make some options cost two or three legendary actions; a legendary action that costs three actions is literally a villain action without the flaws described here.": "在上一点的基础上，小人行动每回合只能使用一次，有时不如每回合能使用多个传奇行动来得刺激和快节奏。虽然单个传奇行动可能没有那么强，但每轮能够真正对党的行动作出多次反应（超出怪物的反应范围），可以使单打独斗比更有挑战性。此外，你总是可以让一些选项花费两个或三个传奇行动；一个花费三个行动的传奇行动简直就是一个没有这里描述的缺陷的反派行动。",
	"As you can see, all of these criticisms are directed towards the \"villain action\" system, which is the only actual part of Colville's video that deviates from the existing 5e system. Thus, I will summarize my {@b adjusted version} of this system into the following advice:": "正如你所看到的，所有这些批评都是针对 \"反派行动 \"系统的，这也是科尔维尔视频中唯一偏离现有5e系统的实际部分。因此，我将把我对这个系统的（%0%）总结为以下建议。",
	"On its turn, a boss monster should have access to both utility-based and damage-based abilities. For example, you can give it the traditional option to Multiattack as an action, and then to reposition one of its allies as a bonus action. Even if the monster is a striker, if all it can do is deal damage, then the monster will probably be boring unless great care is taken in making the monster fun and exciting.": "在它的回合中，BOSS怪应该可以使用基于效用和基于伤害的能力。例如，你可以给它一个传统的选择，将多重攻击作为一个行动，然后将它的一个盟友重新定位作为一个额外的行动。即使怪物是一个前锋，如果它能做的只是造成伤害，那么这个怪物可能会很无聊，除非非常小心地使这个怪物变得有趣和令人兴奋。",
	"Outside of its turn, a boss monster should be able to respond to the party's behavior through the use of extra abilities. Such abilities often take the form of reactions (directly responding to a trigger) and legendary actions (using an ability after a party member ends its turn), but variants of these abilities can work too if done right.": "在它的回合之外，BOSS怪物应该能够通过使用额外的能力来回应党派的行为。这种能力通常采取反应（直接对触发器做出反应）和传奇行动（在一方成员结束其回合后使用一种能力）的形式，但如果做得好的话，这些能力的变种也可以发挥作用。",
	"To make a boss monster cool, it shouldn't be using the same abilities over and over again. Whether through a diverse pool of legendary actions or a sequence of scripted events, using different abilities as the rounds go on maintains the excitement and tension over the course of the fight.": "要让一个BOSS怪物变得很酷，它不应该重复使用同样的能力。无论是通过多样化的传奇行动池，还是通过一连串的脚本事件，随着回合的进行，使用不同的能力可以保持战斗过程中的兴奋和紧张。",
	"A few years ago, the {@link Angry GM|https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/} released a blog post about designing boss fights in 5e. In particular, he drafted up a stat block for a \"two-headed, two-tailed, bifurcated snake\", which while silly on its own, reveals an interesting concept for \"paragon monsters\": to make a boss monster, you can effectively combine two different monsters into one stat block. Such a paragon monster has two core components:": "几年前，{@link Angry GM|https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/}发布了一篇关于在5e中设计boss战斗的博文。特别是，他起草了一个 \"双头双尾的分叉蛇 \"的状态块，虽然它本身很傻，但却揭示了一个有趣的 \"准怪物 \"概念：为了制作一个BOSS怪物，你可以有效地将两种不同的怪物组合成一个状态块。这样的准星怪物有两个核心组成部分。",
	"Health Pools: The monster has multiple health pools. This lends itself well to boss phases, and it also acts as a stopgap that prevents the monster from being bursted down. This is because damage doesn't carry over from one health pool to the other. Additionally, when a health pool is reduced to 0, all conditions and effects end on the monster.": "健康池。该怪物有多个健康池。这很适合BOSS阶段，它也是防止怪物被爆掉的一个权宜之计。这是因为伤害不会从一个健康池延续到另一个。此外，当一个健康池减少到0时，该怪物的所有条件和效果都会结束。",
	"Paragon Actions: The monster can take multiple turns and reactions in combat; it gains one turn and reaction for every health pool it currently has.": "准绳行动。怪物在战斗中可以采取多个回合和反应；它目前每拥有一个健康池就会获得一个回合和反应。",
	"Future installments of the series also go into detail on the following variants:": "该系列的未来几期还将详细介绍以下变种。",

	"A lot of this stuff is pretty cool. However, this system has a few flaws:": "这些东西有很多都是相当酷的。然而，这个系统有一些缺陷。",
	"In general, it requires more tracking and notekeeping than a normal legendary monster, especially when dealing with his version of group monsters.": "一般来说，它比普通的传奇怪物需要更多的跟踪和注意，特别是在处理他的版本的群体怪物时。",
	"As the author admits, if you just use the core components, a paragon monster doesn't actually become more interesting. Even though it has extra turns and reactions, it doesn't actually have anything new to use them on by default.": "正如作者所承认的那样，如果你只是使用核心组件，那么一个准星怪物实际上并不会变得更有趣。即使它有额外的回合和反应，但实际上它并没有什么新的东西可以默认使用它们。",
	"With the release of mythic monsters, many of the things that paragon monsters set out to do (e.g. transformations) can be handled via mythic traits and actions intead.": "随着神话怪兽的发布，许多准绳怪兽设定的事情（例如变身）都可以通过神话特性和行动来处理。",
	"This system is rather verbose in how it writes everything out, especially when dealing with multiple forms. While this is fine on its own, it's something to weigh against the simplicity of legendary actions.": "这个系统在写出一切的时候相当啰嗦，尤其是在处理多种形式的时候。虽然这本身很好，但它与传奇行动的简单性相比，是需要权衡的。",
	"As a whole, if you like AngryGM's stuff, feel free to use it.

	"A {@creature guard} has an OCR of 1/4 and a DCR of 0. Changing its weapon from a spear to a greatsword might sound easy enough, but that changes its average damage to 8 ({@damage 2d6 + 1}) - that's twice its one-handed damage!

	"With the guard example, you could always just flavor the guard to have a greatsword, but to continue using the damage dice provided for its spear. While your players could potentially notice that the guard isn't doing that much damage with its \"greatsword\", it is an easy way to vary its weapon of choice without actually changing its statistics.": "以守卫为例，你可以让守卫拥有一把大剑，但继续使用为其长矛提供的伤害骰子。虽然你的玩家可能会注意到这个卫兵用它的 \"大剑 \"造成的伤害并不大，但这是一个简单的方法来改变它所选择的武器，而不需要实际改变它的统计数据。",
	"Changing the spells a monster has access to can have a major impact on its CR. For example, if you give a monster access to the {@spell shield} spell, expect its DCR to become much higher. Meanwhile, giving a monster that mostly has supportive spells access to {@spell fireball} will probably cause its OCR to go up.": "改变一个怪物可以使用的法术会对它的CR产生重大影响。例如，如果你让一个怪物获得（%0%）的法术，预计其DCR会变得更高。同时，让一个主要拥有支持性法术的怪物获得（%1%），可能会导致其OCR上升。",
	"Before changing a monster's spells, first determine the optimal spell sequence that was originally used to calculate its Challenge Rating. Knowing this, we can figure out which spells are harmless to remove and which spells can be added without any problems.": "在改变怪物的法术之前，首先确定原来用来计算其挑战等级的最佳法术序列。知道了这一点，我们就可以算出哪些法术是无害的，哪些法术可以毫无问题地增加。",
	"For example, a {@creature mage} will deal the most damage with a {@spell cone of cold} spell followed by two uses of a 4th-level {@spell fireball}, while also relying on the {@spell counterspell}, {@spell greater invisibility}, {@spell mage armor}, and {@spell shield} spells for defense. This means that every other spell it has is fair game to replace. Adding spells like {@spell mirror image} and {@spell slow} could warrant an increase in CR, so let's instead replace {@spell fire bolt} with {@spell chill touch}, {@spell misty step} with {@spell darkness}, and {@spell ice storm} with {@spell blight} to give this mage a darker bend.": "例如，一个{@creature mage}会用一个{@spell cone of cold}的法术造成最大的伤害，然后再使用两个四级{@spell fireball}的法术，同时也依靠{@spell counterspell}、{@spell greater invisibility}、{@spell mage armor}和{@spell shield}的法术来防御。这意味着它的每一个其他法术都是可以替换的。增加像{@spell mirror image}和{@spell slow}这样的法术可能需要增加CR，所以让我们用{@spell chill touch}替换{@spell fire bolt}，用{@spell darkness}替换{@spell misty step}，用{@spell blight}替换{@spell ice storm}，以使这个法师有更暗的弯曲。",
	"Note that despite not affecting its CR, spell swaps like these can and often will change a monster's combat effectiveness. For example, the mage's {@spell misty step} spell might not contribute to its Challenge Rating, but it is an important tool that allows it to escape melee fights more easily. Without it, this variant mage might be easier to defeat in battle, even though its CR never actually changed.": "请注意，尽管不影响它的挑战值，但像这样的法术互换可以而且常常会改变怪物的战斗力。例如，法师的（%0%）法术可能对它的挑战等级没有贡献，但它是一个重要的工具，可以让它更容易地逃脱近战的战斗。如果没有它，这个变种法师可能更容易在战斗中被打败，尽管它的CR实际上从未改变。",
	"Stat blocks for monsters purposefully don't include any extra equipment so that you are free to customize them as you see fit.": "怪物的状态块特意不包括任何额外的装备，这样你就可以按照你认为合适的方式自由地定制它们。",
	"The PHB includes items like alchemist's fire, caltrops, ball bearings, and oil that are generally used by adventurers, but can also be used by monsters. Especially when used by monsters that are especially weak or otherwise meant for low-level characters, the use of this adventuring gear can have a significant impact on the difficulty of a given encounter, which is only amplified by the amount of preparation time the monsters have.": "PHB中包括像炼金术士之火、卡尔特罗、滚珠轴承和油这样的物品，这些物品一般由冒险者使用，但也可以由怪物使用。特别是当被那些特别弱小的怪物使用时，或者在其他方面是为低级角色准备的，使用这种冒险装备会对特定遭遇的难度产生重大影响，而这种影响只会被怪物的准备时间所放大。",
	"If you are ever looking to give your players a new magic item or two, instead of putting them in a chest at the end of the dungeon, consider giving this item to a monster for it to wield during combat. A monster that wields a magic item is more likely to become a memorable and exciting encounter for your players, and it makes them feel like they have earned the magic item once they have finally defeated its original wielder.": "如果你想给你的玩家一两件新的魔法物品，而不是把它们放在地牢尽头的箱子里，可以考虑把这个物品交给一个怪物，让它在战斗中挥舞。一个挥舞着魔法物品的怪物更有可能成为你的玩家难忘的、令人兴奋的遭遇，而且一旦他们最终击败了魔法物品的原持有者，就会让他们觉得自己已经赢得了这个魔法物品。",
	"Potions, poisons, and other consumable items deserve a special shoutout due to how they interact with monsters. Because a consumable goes away after a monster uses it, the party can't actually loot it from them once it has been defeated. Thus, when giving consumable items to a monster, you needn't consider whether or not they will be balanced in the hands of the party nearly as much as you would with a permanent item. And because monsters are generally only fought once before they are killed, consumable items are more valuable in their hands than in the hands of the players. Best of all, consumable items can still be just as memorable as regular items are. An ogre that drinks a {@item potion of invulnerability} is bound to be just as fun of a fight compared to an ogre that wields a {@item shield of missile attraction}: the only difference is that the party can loot the shield, but not the consumed potion.": "药水、毒药和其他消耗品值得特别一提，因为它们与怪物的互动方式。因为消耗品在怪物使用后就会消失，一旦怪物被打败，党派实际上不能从它们那里掠夺它。因此，在给怪物提供消耗品时，你不需要像考虑永久物品那样考虑它们在玩家手中是否会被平衡。而且，由于怪物在被杀死之前一般只打一次，消耗品在它们手中比在玩家手中更有价值。最重要的是，可消耗物品仍然可以像普通物品一样令人难忘。一个喝了{@item potion of invulnerability}的食人魔与一个挥舞着{@item shield of missile attraction}的食人魔相比，必然是同样有趣的战斗：唯一的区别是，玩家可以掠夺盾牌，但不能掠夺消耗的药水。",
	"Another way to make monsters more interesting is to give them access to more universal options like {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, and {@action Dodge}.": "另一个让怪物更有趣的方法是让它们获得更多的通用选项，如（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。",
	"When a monster hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can allow it to forgo dealing damage and to create some other effect instead. Some example effects are listed below.": "当一个怪物用武器攻击击中一个生物时，你可以让它放弃造成伤害，而是创造一些其他的效果。下面列出了一些效果的例子。",
	"The target is {@condition blinded} until the start (or end) of its next turn.": "目标是{@condition blinded}，直到其下一回合的开始（或结束）。",
	"The target drops one item of the monster's choice that it is holding.": "目标会掉落一件它所持有的怪物选择的物品。",
	"The target's concentration is broken.": "目标的注意力被打破。",
	"The target is pushed, pulled, or otherwise forcibly moved a certain distance as appropriate. This distance should scale with the monster's size: 5 feet for Medium and smaller, 10 feet for Large, 15 feet for Huge, and 20 feet or more for Gargantuan.": "目标被推、拉，或以其他方式强行移动一定的距离。这个距离应与怪物的体型成比例：中型和小型为5英尺，大型为10英尺，巨型为15英尺，巨型为20英尺或更远。",
	"The target is automatically {@condition grappled}, following the same escape rules as other monsters. For an official example of this, see the unarmed strike attack of a {@creature vampire}.": "目标会自动（%0%），遵循与其他怪物相同的逃脱规则。关于这个的正式例子，请看{@creature vampire}的徒手打击攻击。",
	"The target is knocked {@condition prone}.": "目标被击倒{@condition prone}。",
	"The target is {@condition stunned} until the start (or end) of its next turn.": "目标是{@condition stunned}，直到其下一回合的开始（或结束）。",
	"As you can imagine, this setup can be used to inflict other conditions as appropriate. For example, a particularly putrid monster could replace one of its attacks with an attempt to inflict the {@condition poisoned} condition on the target. When appropriate, feel free to have the target of one of these attacks attack make an ability check or saving throw against the effect, instead of rolling to hit their AC.": "正如你所想象的那样，这种设置可以用来适当地施加其他条件。例如，一个特别腐烂的怪物可以把它的一次攻击换成试图对目标造成（%0%）的条件。在适当的时候，可以让这些攻击的目标对该效果进行能力检查或自救，而不是滚动击中他们的AC。",
	"Additionally, note that because monsters work differently than players, it is justified for them to use different rules than PCs do (e.g. see the DMG for rules on {@action Disarm|dmg|disarming} an opponent) for these effects.": "此外，请注意，由于怪物的工作方式与玩家不同，它们使用与NPC不同的规则是合理的（例如，关于（%0%）对手的规则见DMG），以实现这些效果。",
	"Unlike the Attack action, a monster's Multiattack action doesn't allow it to replace its attacks with grapples or shoves by RAW. That said, it's easy enough to ignore RAW here and to allow {@action grapple} and {@action shove} replacement anyway.": "与攻击动作不同，根据RAW，怪物的多重攻击动作不允许它用抓取或推搡来替换其攻击。也就是说，在这里忽略RAW并允许（%0%）和（%1%）的替换是很容易的。",
	"Monsters can make improvised attacks just as players can. Perhaps the {@creature ancient red dragon} that is burning down the city decides to drop a small cart on top of the party, or the evil {@creature thug} that is mugging the party wields a glass bottle as their weapon of choice. You can give your monsters improvised attacks in order to add variety to your combat encounters.": "怪物可以像玩家一样进行即兴的攻击。也许，正在烧毁城市的{@creature ancient red dragon}决定把一辆小车扔在队伍的上面，或者正在抢劫队伍的邪恶{@creature thug}挥舞着玻璃瓶作为他们的首选武器。你可以给你的怪物提供即兴攻击，以便为你的战斗遭遇增加多样性。",
	"As we are making monsters and not player characters, we can ignore the official rules for improvised attacks. Instead, all monsters are proficient in improvised attacks, which can be either melee or ranged (thrown) as appropriate. Compared to the monster's weakest attack, the damage dice of a monster's improvised attacks are one size smaller, to a minimum of {@damage 1d4}. For example, if a monster's weakest attack has damage dice of {@damage 2d10}, its improvised attacks have damage dice of {@damage 2d8}.": "由于我们制作的是怪物而不是玩家角色，所以我们可以忽略官方的即兴攻击规则。相反，所有怪物都精通即兴攻击，这些攻击可以是近战，也可以是远程（投掷），视情况而定。与怪物的最弱攻击相比，怪物的即兴攻击的伤害骰子要小一号，最小为（%0%）。例如，如果一个怪物的最弱攻击的伤害骰子是{@damage 2d10}，它的简易攻击的伤害骰子是{@damage 2d8}。",
	"If you wish to make quick modifications to a monster that doesn't involve rewriting all of its statistics, check out the Creature Templates section of this document (Appendix A). Creature templates are packages of new features and statistical changes you can give to a monster to turn them into something new. For example, the {@book Monster Manual|mm} has a shadow dragon template you can apply to any dragon to turn them into a Shadowfell-based version of themselves. With generic templates like the ones provided in this document, customizing a monster becomes super easy, while still allowing the impact on its final Challenge Rating to be predictable or otherwise easy to calculate.": "如果你想对一个怪物进行快速修改，而不涉及重写它的所有统计数据，请查看本文件的生物模板部分（附录A）。生物模板是一揽子的新特征和统计学上的改变，你可以赋予一个怪物以新的东西。例如，{@book Monster Manual|mm}有一个影子龙模板，你可以应用到任何龙身上，把它们变成一个基于影子城的版本。有了本文提供的通用模板，定制一个怪物变得超级容易，同时还可以预测对其最终挑战等级的影响，或以其他方式轻松计算。",
	"To make generic monsters more interesting, you can give them cult features or supernatural boons that help to convey their flavor more effectively.": "为了使一般的怪物更加有趣，你可以赋予它们邪教特征或超自然的好处，以帮助更有效地传达它们的味道。",
	"In the official books, these cult features and supernatural boons take the following forms:": "在官方书籍中，这些邪教特征和超自然的好处有以下形式。",
	"Elder Evil Blessings for members of an Elder Evil cult": "长老邪教成员的长老邪教祝福",
	"Demonic Boons granted by especially powerful demons or demon lords": "由特别强大的恶魔或恶魔领主授予的恶魔恩惠",
	"Diabolical Cults in service of various archdevils that grant cult features": "为各种大恶魔服务的邪恶邪教，授予邪教的特征",
	"Worshippers of an evil god like Bhaal that all have the same set of features": "像Bhaal这样的邪神的崇拜者，都有一套相同的特征",
	"In addition to these official options, I encourage you to create your own features that are shared between members of the organizations and cults of your campaign. The basic setup is to create one option that most members have access to, and another option that only the elites or upper echelon of the faction can get. Generally speaking, these features are primarily applicable in combat scenarios, and don't contribute too much to a creature's Challenge Rating.": "除了这些官方选项之外，我鼓励你创建自己的功能，让你的活动中的组织和邪教成员共享。基本的设置是创建一个大多数成员都能使用的选项，以及另一个只有派系的精英或上层人士才能获得的选项。一般来说，这些功能主要适用于战斗场景，对生物的挑战等级没有太大贡献。",
	"By using cult features and supernatural boons, you create a cohesive theme and flavor that can be conveyed mechanically, rather than just through descriptions and roleplay.": "通过使用邪教的特征和超自然的恩惠，你可以创造一个有凝聚力的主题和味道，可以通过机械的方式来传达，而不仅仅是通过描述和角色扮演。",
	"You could decide to give a monster access to a feat or class feature, setting it apart from its peers. The PC Options for Monsters section of this document will have everything you need to do this.": "你可以决定让一个怪物获得一项特技或等级特征，使它与其他怪物不同。本文件的 \"怪物的PC选项 \"部分将提供你需要的一切。",
	"While spellcasting provides plenty of opportunities for customization, it still might fall short at times. Here's what you can do to change that.": "虽然施法提供了大量的自定义机会，但有时仍然可能会有不足。下面是你可以做的事情，以改变这种情况。",
	"To see many of the changes below in action, check out the {@creature force mage|BMG} stat block in Appendix C.": "要看到下面的许多变化，请查看附录C中的（%0%）统计块。",
	"Compared to the normal Spellcasting feature, Innate Spellcasting is very freeform. Instead of using rigid spell slots, it lets you assign how many times a given spell can be cast each day. It can even allow a monster to cast a leveled spell at will, if appropriate.": "与普通的施法功能相比，先天施法是非常自由的。它不使用死板的法术槽，而是让你指定一个特定的法术每天可以施放多少次。如果合适的话，它甚至可以让一个怪物随意施放一个等级的法术。",
	"But why does this approach need to be restricted to innate spellcasters, anyway? If monsters don't have to follow the same rules as players in other instances, then why do they use the same spell slot system as them? The answer is that while official monsters might use slots, you don't have to.": "但无论如何，为什么这种方法需要限制在先天法术师身上？如果怪物在其他情况下不必遵循与玩家相同的规则，那么为什么它们要与玩家使用相同的法术槽系统？答案是，虽然官方的怪物可能会使用插槽，但你不必如此。",
	"Having daily spells via a Spellcasting feature doesn't take any effort. The format of the header is basically identical to that of an innate spellcaster, except with all mentions of \"innate\" removed and a spellcasting class and level optionally being referenced.": "通过咒语功能拥有日常法术并不需要任何努力。标题的格式与先天法术师的格式基本相同，只是去掉了所有提到 \"先天 \"的地方，并选择性地引用了法术等级和级别。",
	"This approach makes balancing spellcasting monsters much easier, while also making them easier to track in combat. For example, you can use this approach to cut out any non-combat spells, or to make its main attack spell at-will for simplicity.": "这种方法使平衡施法的怪物变得更容易，同时也使它们在战斗中更容易追踪。例如，你可以用这种方法删去任何非战斗法术，或者为了简单起见，让它的主要攻击法术随心所欲。",
	"Official monsters sometimes have extra parenthetical notes after their innate spells. For example, you might find \"(self only)\" after a {@spell mage armor} or {@spell plane shift} spell. We can use this notation as a way to deliver other changes to certain spells.": "官方怪物的先天法术后面有时会有额外的括号说明。例如，你可能会在{@spell mage armor}或{@spell plane shift}的法术后发现\"(只针对自己)\"。我们可以用这种注解作为对某些法术进行其他改变的方式来传递。",
	"If you wish to string more than one of these modifications together, use a single set of parentheses, with each modification being separated by a semicolon.": "如果你想把这些修改中的一个以上串起来，请使用一组括号，每个修改用分号分开。",
	"By default, innate spellcasters (as well as daily spellcasters, as above) cast their spells at the lowest level possible. However, you can add a note that allows a monster to cast certain spells at higher levels. For example, a monster that has \"{@spell fireball} (5th level)\" will cast this spell at 5th level every time, instead of 3rd level.": "默认情况下，先天法术师（以及如上所述的日常法术师）以尽可能低的等级施法。然而，你可以添加一个注释，允许怪物以更高的等级施放某些法术。例如，一个拥有\"（%0%）（5级）\"的怪物每次都会在5级施放这个法术，而不是3级。",
	"You can change the damage type of a monster's spell if it is appropriate for its theme. For example, a monster that has \"{@spell incendiary cloud} (necrotic damage)\" will deal necrotic damage with this spell, instead of its normal damage type.": "你可以改变一个怪物的法术的伤害类型，如果它适合它的主题。例如，一个拥有\"（%0%）（坏死伤害）\"的怪物将用这个法术造成坏死伤害，而不是它的正常伤害类型。",
	"You can change the number of targets a spell will have. For example, you can write \"{@spell blight} (two targets)\" or \"{@spell bless} (one target only)\". Note that the former example is a good way to represent the Twinned Spell metamagic.": "你可以改变一个法术的目标数量。例如，你可以写\"（%0%）（两个目标）\"或\"（%1%）（只有一个目标）\"。注意，前一个例子是表示孪生法术元神的好方法。",
	"You can change the size of a spell's area of effect, or you can change its range. For example, a monster that has \"{@spell fire bolt} (240-foot range)\" will be able to cast this spell at twice its normal range, and a monster with \"{@spell cone of cold} (120-foot cone)\" will create a much larger blast of cold than normal.": "你可以改变一个法术效果区的大小，也可以改变其范围。例如，一个拥有\"{@spell fire bolt}(240英尺范围) \"的怪物将能以其正常范围的两倍施放此法术，而一个拥有\"{@spell cone of cold}(120英尺锥体) \"的怪物将创造出比正常情况下大得多的寒冷爆炸。",
	"When a spell has a variety of effects or possibilities to choose from, you can choose to restrict them as appropriate. For example, a monster with \"{@spell animal shapes} (insects only)\" can only use the spell to turn others into insectoid beasts, while a monster with \"{@spell symbol} (discord only)\" can only create a discord glyph when it casts the spell.": "当一个法术有多种效果或可能性可供选择时，你可以选择适当地限制它们。例如，一个拥有\"{@spell animal shapes}（仅昆虫）\"的怪物只能使用该法术将其他人变成昆虫状的野兽，而一个拥有\"{@spell symbol}（仅不和）\"的怪物在施法时只能创造一个不和石刻。",
	"The adventure {@i Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus} introduced the following notation to 5e:": "冒险（%0%）为5e引入了以下符号。",
	"{@b {@i Ray of Sickness (1st-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).}} {@atk rs} {@hit 5} to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. {@h} 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the end of the monster's next turn. If the monster casts this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledice 2d8|2-9|1d8} for each slot level above 1st.": "{@b {@i Ray of Sickness (1st-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).}} {@atk rs} {@hit 5}击中，范围60英尺，一个生物。{@h} 9 ({@damage 2d8})的毒药伤害，目标必须在DC13宪法救赎中成功，否则会被{@condition poisoned}，直到怪物的下一个回合结束。如果怪物使用二级以上的法术槽施放此法术，每超过一级的法术槽等级，伤害会增加（%6%）。",
	"In the official books, this notation is used to make spellcasting monsters easier to run, as it reduces the amount of bookkeeping required to use them. However, what if we could take advantage of this for our own purposes?": "在官方书籍中，这种记号是用来使施法怪物更容易运行的，因为它减少了使用它们所需的簿记量。然而，如果我们可以为自己的目的利用这个优势呢？",
	"As it turns out, we can use this notation to give a monster access to spells of our own design. We can do this in any of the following cases:": "事实证明，我们可以使用这个符号来让怪物获得我们自己设计的法术。我们可以在以下任何一种情况下这样做。",
	"The monster significantly modified an existing spell somehow": "怪物以某种方式显著地修改了现有的法术",

	"We want to give the monster a magical effect that can interact with {@spell counterspell} and {@spell dispel magic}": "我们想给怪物一个神奇的效果，可以与（%0%）和（%1%）互动",
	"To do this, we only need to list our custom spell as a regular monster feature, and to explicitly label that it is a leveled spell as appropriate. For example, you can give a particularly necromantic monster access to the following homebrew spell of my own design:": "要做到这一点，我们只需要把我们的自定义法术列为常规的怪物特征，并在适当的时候明确地标明它是一个有等级的法术。例如，你可以让一个特别死灵的怪物获得以下我自己设计的自制法术。",

The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 13 ({@damage 3d8}) necrotic damage and be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute or until the monster's concentration ends. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 13 ({@damage 3d8}) necrotic damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on the target on a successful one.": "{@b {@i Clutch of Orcus (3rd-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).}}60英尺范围内怪物选择的一个人形生物开始遭受魔法引起的心脏病发作。目标必须在DC14宪法救赎中成功，否则会受到13({@damage 3d8})的坏死伤害和{@condition stunned}，持续1分钟或直到该怪物的注意力结束。在它的每个回合结束时，目标会重复这个蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，它将受到13({@damage 3d8})的坏死伤害，如果救赎成功，法术将在目标身上结束。",
	"Keep in mind that you don't have to tie these spells to spell slots. For example, you can make them at will, or you can put them on a recharge like other monster features. The only thing that distinguishes one of these from a regular monster feature is that it counts as a spell for the purpose of other game effects.": "请记住，你不必将这些法术与法术槽联系起来。例如，你可以随心所欲地制造它们，也可以像其他怪物特征一样把它们放在一个充值上。区别于普通怪物特征的唯一一点是，就其他游戏效果而言，它算作是一个法术。",
	"Even with the variety of generic features available for you to choose from, there are times when it is appropriate to give your monsters some of the options that are normally used by player characters.": "即使有各种各样的通用功能供你选择，有时也应该给你的怪物一些通常由玩家角色使用的选项。",
	"Page 282 of the DMG describes two ways of creating NPCs from scratch: making a traditional stat block, or using the same process that you use to create a player character. While the second option might make sense when creating an NPC companion for the party, there are some important reasons why using class levels to make NPCs doesn't work:": "DMG第282页描述了从头开始创建NPC的两种方法：制作传统的状态块，或者使用创建玩家角色的相同过程。虽然在为党派创建NPC同伴时，第二种选择可能是有意义的，但有一些重要的原因说明使用等级来制造NPC是行不通的。",
	"Classes are designed with resources, flavorful ribbon features, and other unique abilities for a single player to be preoccupied with. As a DM, having to handle an entire PC while also running the rest of the game is a lot of effort.": "类的设计有资源、有味道的带状特征，以及其他独特的能力，供单个玩家先入为主。作为一个管理员，要处理整个PC，同时还要运行游戏的其他部分，这是很费劲的。",
	"Player characters are designed to have enough power to handle multiple combat encounters per adventuring day, while monsters are built to be ran once before being defeated. This means that NPCs built using class levels will have a very high damage output compared to their defensive capabilities. This is the same reason why running one encounter per adventuring day is an issue, and why PvP between characters in the same party almost always goes wrong.": "玩家角色被设计成有足够的力量来处理每个冒险日的多次战斗遭遇，而怪物则被设计成在被击败之前跑一次。这意味着，与他们的防御能力相比，使用等级构建的NPC将有非常高的伤害输出。这也是为什么每个冒险日只遇到一次是个问题的原因，也是为什么同一方的角色之间的PvP几乎总是出错的原因。",
	"To summarize, {@b you shouldn't build your monsters the same way you build player characters}. But then an issue arises, how do you make a stat block for a monster that is associated with a given player class?": "概括地说，（%0%）。但随后出现了一个问题，你如何为一个与特定玩家等级相关的怪物制作一个状态块？",
	"First, let's discuss the official options for this. Page 283 of the DMG presents a process you can use to give class levels to pre-existing monsters. In short, it's the same as it is with players, but the monster's hit dice stay the same size, and its proficiency bonus is based on the Challenge Rating you end up with.": "首先，我们来讨论一下官方对此的选择。DMG第283页介绍了一个可以用来给预先存在的怪物设置等级的过程。简而言之，这与玩家的做法相同，但怪物的命中率保持不变，其熟练度奖励则基于你最终得到的挑战等级。",
	"This process is decent when used in moderation. After all, only one or two levels in fighter don't offer much in terms of resource management compared to five or six levels in druid. Even so, this method still has the same flaws given in the previous section. Additionally, the same section admits that adding class levels to a monster has an extremely variable effect on CR. This is to be expected: PCs are built differently from monsters, so of course things work differently. That said, it goes against the monster design steps described in this document: if the goal is to determine a target CR before making the monster, then giving the monster class levels will be a guessing game.": "这个过程在适度使用时是很好的。毕竟，与德鲁伊的五、六级相比，战士只有一、二级在资源管理方面没有什么优势。即便如此，这种方法仍然有上一节中提到的缺陷。此外，同一章节还承认，给怪物增加等级对CR的影响极为不同。这是可以预料的。PC的构造与怪物不同，所以事情的效果当然也不同。尽管如此，这也违背了本文件中描述的怪物设计步骤：如果目标是在制作怪物之前确定一个目标CR，那么给怪物增加等级将是一个猜测游戏。",
	"So how can we do better? Simply put, we can build monsters using individual class features and unique traits of our own design that we pick and choose as appropriate.": "那么，我们如何才能做得更好呢？简单地说，我们可以利用我们自己设计的个别类特征和独特的特质来建造怪物，我们可以根据情况进行挑选。",
	"It is clear that the player classes that exist in the game are not encompassing of every power source and archetype out there. Additionally, not all creatures within the same class gain the same abilities. Here is a list of a few of these differences:": "很明显，游戏中存在的玩家等级并不包括所有的力量来源和原型。此外，并非所有同一等级的生物都能获得相同的能力。以下是其中一些差异的列表。",
	"Not all members of a class gain a subclass. For example, {@creature mage|mm|mages} don't have an Arcane Tradition.": "并非所有类别的成员都能获得一个子类别。例如，{@creature mage|mm|mages}没有一个奥术传统。",
	"Some members of a class gain new abilities that players can't access. For example, {@creature bard|vgm|bards} have a Taunt ability that normal bards can't normally get.": "一个等级的某些成员获得了玩家无法获得的新能力。例如，{@creature bard|vgm|bards}有一个普通吟游诗人通常无法获得的嘲弄能力。",
	"Not all members of a class gain certain class features. For example, some druids might not have Wild Shape, while others might not even have spellcasting.": "并非所有类别的成员都能获得某些类别特征。例如，有些德鲁伊可能没有 \"野性之形\"，而有些德鲁伊可能甚至没有法术。",
	"Some members of a class can further develop their abilities or can reduce their restrictions. For example, {@creature diviner|vgm|diviners} have a modified version of Portent that is rolled during combat rather than after a long rest, and it recharges whenever the diviner casts a divination spell of 1st level or higher, rather than being limited to two uses per day.": "一个等级的某些成员可以进一步发展他们的能力，或者可以减少他们的限制。例如，{@creature diviner|vgm|diviners}有一个改良版的预言术，在战斗中而不是在长时间休息后进行滚动，而且每当占卜师施展一级或以上的占卜法术时，它就会充能，而不是限制每天使用两次。",
	"This understanding can be used to justify monsters that are associated with certain classes having features that players don't have access to. For example, you can give the Martial Advantage feature to fighter-like warriors, and you can give resistance to damage from spells to archmages and other powerful wizards. This is elaborated on in the Example Monster Class Features section below. For now, let's discuss how to use existing class features on your monsters.": "这种理解可以用来证明与某些等级相关的怪物具有玩家无法获得的特征。例如，你可以给战士类的武士以武术优势特性，你可以给大法师和其他强大的巫师以抵抗法术伤害的特性。这一点将在下面的 \"怪物类别特征实例 \"部分详细说明。现在，让我们讨论一下如何在你的怪物身上使用现有的等级特征。",
	"It is worth noting that many class features, like Action Surge, Cunning Action, and Spellcasting, are fairly easy to give to monsters as-is. But then there are some features, like Ki, Metamagic, and Wild Shape, that need some modifications before being given to a monster.": "值得注意的是，许多等级特征，比如行动突进、狡猾行动和法术攻击，都很容易按原样赋予怪物。但也有一些特征，如Ki、Metamagic和Wild Shape，需要在给怪物之前进行一些修改。",
	"Traditionally, monsters can access their abilities through the following resources, as described in the {@book Monster Manual|mm}:": "传统上，怪物可以通过以下资源获得它们的能力，如（%0%）中所述。",
	"At will: A monster can use this ability without any resource restrictions.": "随意。一个怪物可以不受任何资源限制地使用这种能力。",
	"1/Turn: A monster can only use this ability once per turn, or maybe only on each of their turns.": "1/回合。怪物每回合只能使用此能力一次，也可能只在其每个回合使用。",
	"Recharge: Once a monster uses this ability, they have to roll a {@dice d6} each round to see if they can use it again.": "充电。一旦怪物使用了这种能力，他们必须在每一回合掷出{@dice d6}，看他们是否能再次使用它。",
	"Short Rest: Once a monster uses this ability, they can't do so again until they finish a short or long rest.": "短暂休息。一旦怪物使用这个能力，它们就不能再这样做了，直到它们完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"Spell Slots: A monster must expend a spell slot of appropriate level to use this spell or other ability.": "法术槽。怪物必须消耗一个相应等级的法术槽来使用这个法术或其他能力。",
	"X/Day: A monster has X uses of this ability. They regain all expended uses of it when they finish a short or long rest.": "X/天。一个怪物有X次使用这个能力的机会。当他们完成短期或长期休息时，他们会恢复所有已使用的能力。",
	"Many class features work through other resources that could be converted to one of the ones above:": "许多班级的特点是通过其他资源工作，可以转换为上述的一种。",
	"X times Short Rest: Instead of tracking uses of features like Ki and Combat Superiority between short rests, it might make sense to give a monster's maneuvers or ki arts a Recharge of 4-6, or perhaps you can make some of them 1/turn or at-will as appropriate.": "短暂休息X次：与其在短暂休息之间跟踪像Ki和战斗优势这样的功能的使用，不如给怪物的演习或Ki艺术一个4-6的充能，或者你可以根据情况使其中一些成为1轮或随意的。",
	"Channel Divinity: Instead of sharing one resource pool, you can just make each one an independent Short Rest ability.": "通道神性。与其共享一个资源池，不如直接让每个人都有独立的短时休息能力。",
	"Special: Features like a Zealot Barbarian's Fanatical Focus that only work once per rage or otherwise are limited in some unique way should typically be made at will or on a recharge": "特殊性。像狂热者野蛮人的狂热焦点这样的功能，每一次狂暴只起一次作用，或者以某种独特的方式限制，通常应该是随意的或在充能时进行。",
	"In general, you should consider how many times you want your monster to use a certain feature per round. If you only want it to work once or twice, tie it to a short rest or make it X/Day. If you want it to be used frequently but not every round, give it a recharge. If you want it to be used throughout the entire fight, make it at will or turn it into a passive ability.": "一般来说，你应该考虑你想让你的怪物每轮使用多少次某项功能。如果你只想让它发挥作用一次或两次，那就把它与短暂的休息联系起来，或者让它在X天内发挥作用。如果你想让它经常使用，但不是每轮都使用，就给它充能。如果你想让它在整个战斗中使用，那就使它随心所欲，或者把它变成一种被动能力。",
	"Not all class features are necessary to give a monster. In general, consider excluding the following abilities from a monster:": "并非所有的等级特征都有必要赋予一个怪物。一般来说，可以考虑将以下能力排除在怪物之外。",
	"Niche Abilities: Unless you forsee the monster using this ability in combat, don't add it. For example, a cleric monster won't need Turn Undead unless it is relevant to their theme or if the campaign has a lot of undead in it.": "利基能力。除非你能预见怪物在战斗中使用这种能力，否则不要添加它。例如，一个牧师怪物不需要变成亡灵，除非这与他们的主题有关，或者如果战役中有大量的亡灵。",
	"Skill Bonuses: Features like Jack of All Trades and Reliable Talent can be replaced with extra skill proficiencies. The monster can also be given expertise in certain skills as appropriate.": "技能奖励。像 \"万事通 \"和 \"可靠的人才 \"这样的特征可以用额外的技能熟练度代替。怪物也可以根据情况被赋予某些技能的专长。",
	"Modifiers: Features like a Fighting Style, the War Wizard's Tactical Wit, and the Lifedrinker warlock invocation aren't necessary unless they are really important to the monster. For example, you can replace Tactical Wit with advantage on all initiative rolls, and you can simply add extra dice of necrotic damage to the warlock's melee weapons. You can exclude a Fighting Style altogether, as the monster's AC and attack bonus are already cutomized according to CR.": "修改器。像战斗风格、战争巫师的战术智慧和生命术士的召唤这样的特性是没有必要的，除非它们对怪物真的很重要。例如，你可以用在所有主动性卷轴上的优势来取代战术智慧，你也可以简单地在术士的近战武器上增加额外的坏死伤害骰子。你可以把战斗风格完全排除在外，因为怪物的AC和攻击奖励已经根据CR进行了切割。",
	"Resource Buffs: Features like Arcane Recovery and a Samurai Fighter's Tireless Spirit aren't usually needed. In the latter case, you can just choose a different resource as discussed in the previous section.": "资源缓冲。像奥术恢复和武士战士的不知疲倦的精神这样的特性通常不需要。在后者的情况下，你可以像上一节讨论的那样选择不同的资源。",
	"Extras: Features that add extra cantrips, spells, languages, skills, tools, movement, resistances, and so on don't need to be written down or anything. You can simply parse them and add them to the monster's statistics, without any actual mention of the feature unless you feel it is necessary.": "额外功能。增加额外的咒语、法术、语言、技能、工具、移动、抵抗力等等的特征不需要写下来或其他什么。你可以简单地解析它们，并将其添加到怪物的统计资料中，除非你觉得有必要，否则不需要实际提及该特征。",
	"Non-Combat Abilities: Features like a Battle Master Fighter's Know Your Enemy and an Inquisitive Rogue's Eye for Detail can be useful, but not only are they niche, but they are almost entirely non-combat abilities. Simply exclude them unless you feel they are necessary.": "非战斗能力。像战斗大师的 \"知己知彼 \"和好奇心强的游侠的 \"眼观六路 \"这样的能力可能很有用，但它们不仅是小众的，而且几乎完全是非战斗能力。除非你觉得它们是必要的，否则就把它们排除在外。",
	"Some class features, such as Second Wind and Spellcasting, have damage or uses that scale off of your level in that class. So if you aren't actually adding class levels to a monster, then how do you determine what level it counts as? You have two options: use the monster's CR, or come up with the monster's \"virtual class level\". After all, even if it doesn't actually have a class level, the monster might {@i represent} a certain class level, so you can use that target level for scalings.": "一些等级特征，例如 \"第二风 \"和 \"法术\"，其伤害或使用是根据你在该等级中的等级来计算的。那么，如果你没有给怪物增加等级，那么你如何确定它的等级呢？你有两个选择：使用怪物的CR，或者想出怪物的 \"虚拟等级\"。毕竟，即使它实际上没有等级，怪物也可能（%0%）有一定的等级，所以你可以使用这个目标等级来进行缩放。",
	"In the Example Monster Features section below, I use the latter option. Feel free to use either one, or to remove the scalings altogether.": "在下面的怪物特征示例部分，我使用了后一种选项。你可以自由地使用其中任何一种，或者完全删除标度。",
	"As you go higher and higher on the CR scale, it becomes harder and harder to make a monster that doesn't have some any manner of supernatural attack (e.g. spellcasting) or defense (e.g. damage resistances). This is because it is harder to make a \"mundane\" monster that deals enough damage, has adequate defenses, has a proper justification for its powers, and as a whole is an interesting creature to fight. For example, it makes sense for the typical {@creature iron golem} to have 210 HP due to its size and material, but a humanoid pit fighter with 210 HP is bound to be among the strongest warriors in the region or even the entire setting.": "当你的CR值越来越高时，要制作一个没有任何形式的超自然攻击（如咒语）或防御（如伤害抵抗）的怪物就越来越难。这是因为要制作一个能造成足够的伤害、有足够的防御力、有适当的能力理由、整体上是一个有趣的战斗生物的 \"世俗 \"怪物是比较困难的。例如，由于体型和材料的原因，典型的（%0%）有210HP是合理的，但一个有210HP的人形坑道战士必然是该地区甚至整个设定中最强的战士之一。",
	"Because of this, many martial creatures (especially those representing the barbarian, fighter, and rogue classes) need extra attacks, saving throw proficiencies, magic items, legendary resistances, legendary actions, or innate spells in order to reach higher CRs. Keep this in mind when designing your monsters.": "正因为如此，许多武术生物（尤其是那些代表野蛮人、战士和无赖等级的生物）需要额外的攻击、蓄力熟练度、魔法物品、传奇抗性、传奇行动或先天法术，以达到更高的CR。在设计你的怪兽时，请记住这一点。",
	"In addition to picking and choosing from existing class and subclass features, consider using the following features to represent monsters that are associated with certain character classes.": "除了从现有的类和子类特征中进行挑选外，还可以考虑使用以下特征来表示与某些角色类相关的怪物。",
	"Artificers are tricky because they are inherently tied to magic items, which are something most monsters don't have. That said, infusions vanish from an item at least one day after the monster's death, allowing you to give an artificer monster items without fear of your players getting their hands on them.": "工匠是很棘手的，因为他们本质上与魔法物品联系在一起，而这是大多数怪物没有的东西。也就是说，注入物在怪物死亡后至少有一天会从物品中消失，这让你可以给工匠怪物物品而不用担心你的玩家会染指它们。",
	"The monster can cast spells of 1st level at will, without expending a spell slot.": "该怪物可以随心所欲地施放一级法术，而不需要消耗一个法术槽。",
	"On each of its turns, the monster can use a bonus action to take the {@action Help}, {@action Search}, or {@action Use an Object} action.": "在它的每个回合中，怪物可以使用一个额外的行动来进行（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）的行动。",
	"As an action, the monster can roll a {@dice d4} and regain a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.": "作为一个行动，怪物可以掷出（%0%）并重新获得一个该等级或更低的法术槽。如果它没有用过的该等级或更低的法术槽，则不会发生任何事情。",
	"When the monster casts a spell that deals damage, it can change the spell's damage to cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder.": "当怪物施展造成伤害的法术时，它可以将法术的伤害改为冷、火、力、闪电或雷霆。",
	"At the start of its turn, the monster can immediately swap one of its prepared spells for another spell on the artificer spell list.": "在它的回合开始时，怪物可以立即将它准备的一个法术换成工匠法术列表中的另一个法术。",
	"Barbarians are easy to represent due to their straightforward manner of attacking. To reach higher CRs, they can be given damage resistances and other forms of damage mitigation that are adequately explained by their Rage feature.": "野蛮人由于其直截了当的攻击方式而易于表现。为了达到更高的等级，他们可以被赋予伤害抵抗和其他形式的伤害减免，这些都可以通过他们的狂暴特征来充分解释。",
	"A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the monster hits with it (included in the attack).": "当怪物用它击中时，近战武器会造成其伤害的一个额外模子（包括在攻击中）。",
	"The monster scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.": "怪物在掷出19或20时获得关键打击，并掷出三次伤害骰子，而不是两次。",
	"In combat, the monster is raging while it isn't {@condition incapacitated}. While raging, the monster has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it deals one extra die of damage when it hits with a melee weapon attack.": "在战斗中，该怪物会在非战斗状态下狂暴（%0%）。在暴怒时，怪物在力量检查和力量投掷方面有优势，它对击打、穿刺和切割伤害有抵抗力，并且当它用近战武器攻击时，会造成一个额外的伤害。",
	"At the start of its turn, the monster can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.": "在它的回合开始时，该怪物可以在它在该回合内所做的所有近战武器攻击卷上获得优势，但对它的攻击卷有优势，直到它下一回合开始。",
	"If the monster takes damage that is equal to or less than 10 + its Constitution modifier that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.": "如果怪物受到的伤害等于或小于10+它的体质修正值，会使它的命中率降为0，那么它的命中率反而会降为1。",
	"Bards can easily be represented through their spells, music, and skill proficiencies (including Expertise). Beyond that, any features you give a bardic monster should relate to their Bardic Inspiration or should be usable on top of their spellcasting.": "吟游诗人可以很容易地通过他们的法术、音乐和技能熟练度（包括专业技能）来体现。除此之外，你给吟游诗人怪物的任何特征都应该与他们的吟游灵感有关，或者应该可以在他们的咒语之上使用。",
	"As a bonus action, the monster chooses one creature within 60 feet of it that can hear the monster. Once within the next 10 minutes, the target can roll a {@dice d6} and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.": "作为一个额外的动作，该怪物在它周围60英尺内选择一个能听到它的生物。在接下来的10分钟内，该目标可以掷出一个{@dice d6}，并将掷出的数字加入它所做的一个能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力动作中。",
	"While the monster isn't {@condition incapacitated} and can play its music, allies within 30 feet of the monster that can hear the monster have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.": "当怪物不是{@condition incapacitated}并能播放它的音乐时，在怪物30英尺范围内的盟友如果能听到怪物的声音，在攻击卷和蓄力上都有优势。",
	"While the monster isn't {@condition incapacitated} and can play its music, the monster and any ally within 60 feet of it that can hear the monster has advantage on saving throws against being {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}.": "当怪物不是{@condition incapacitated}并能播放它的音乐时，怪物和它周围60英尺内能听到怪物的任何盟友在对被{@condition charmed}或{@condition frightened}的拯救动作上有优势。",
	"At the start of each of the monster's turns, each ally that can hear the monster gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + the monster's Charisma modifier. This ability doesn't function while the monster is {@condition incapacitated} or otherwise can't play its music.": "在怪物的每个回合开始时，每个能听到怪物声音的盟友都会获得相当于5+怪物魅力修正值的临时打击点数。当怪物处于{@condition incapacitated}或无法演奏其音乐时，此能力不发挥作用。",
	"The bard can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC is Charisma-based) or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.": "吟游诗人可以在它的回合中使用一个额外的动作，针对它30英尺内的一个生物。如果目标能听到吟游诗人的声音，那么目标必须成功地进行魅力救赎（DC是基于魅力的），或者在能力检查、攻击卷和救赎方面处于劣势，直到吟游诗人的下一个回合开始。",
	"As clerics gain most of their power from their Divine Domains, it's easy enough to represent the base class through spellcasting and some other features as appropriate. In particular, Channel Divinities can be represented as individual short rest abilities or as recharge abilities rather than costing a resource.": "由于牧师从他们的神域中获得了大部分的力量，因此很容易通过咒语和其他一些适当的特征来表现基础等级。特别是，\"神力通道 \"可以表现为单独的短时休息能力或充能能力，而不是花费一种资源。",
	"As a bonus action, the monster can expend a spell slot to cause its melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 ({@damage 3d6}) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If the monster expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by {@scaledice 3d6|2-9|1d6} for each level above 1st.": "作为一个额外的行动，怪物可以消耗一个法术槽来使它的近战武器攻击在命中时对一个目标造成额外的10（（%0%））辐射伤害。这个好处一直持续到回合结束。如果怪物消耗了一个2级以上的法术槽，1级以上的每一级的额外伤害都会增加（%1%）。",
	"The monster calls upon the aid of a deity or some other divine power. Roll a {@dice d100}. If the number rolled is equal to or lower than the monster's virtual cleric level, the divine power intervenes by duplicating the effects of some spell. The spell normally must be 6th level or lower, but can be higher if the monster is capable of casting spells of a higher level. On a failed {@dice d100} roll, the divine power only intervenes with a beneficial spell of 4th level or lower, with targets chosen by the monster as appropriate.": "怪物召唤神灵或其他神性力量的帮助。掷一个（%0%）。如果掷出的数字等于或低于怪物的虚拟牧师等级，神力就会通过复制某种法术的效果进行干预。该法术通常必须是6级或更低的，但如果该怪物能够施展更高等级的法术，则可以更高。如果失败（%1%），神力只用4级或更低的有益法术进行干预，目标由怪物选择，这很合适。",
	"As a bonus action, the monster can target one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target regains hit points equal to the monster's Wisdom modifier.": "作为一个额外的动作，怪物可以将它所看到的30英尺内的一个生物作为目标。目标重新获得相当于该怪物智慧修正值的打击点数。",
	"Each creature of the monster's choice within 30 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw (DC is Wisdom-based), taking necrotic or radiant damage (monster's choice) equal to twice the monster's virtual cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "在它30英尺范围内的每个怪物都必须做一个 \"宪法 \"救赎（DC是基于智慧的），如果救赎失败，将受到相当于该怪物虚拟牧师等级两倍的坏死或辐射伤害（怪物自己选择），如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。",
	"When the monster or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the monster can use its reaction to add or subtract its Wisdom modifier from the roll.": "当怪物或它能看到的生物进行攻击卷、蓄力或能力检查时，怪物可以用它的反应在卷上加上或减去它的智慧修正值。",
	"The druid class has two big components: spellcasting, and Wild Shape. Feel free to exclude either feature from your druid-like monsters as you see fit. Particularly strong druids can also receive traditional traits like Aggressive, Reckless, and Siege Monster while in beast form via Wild Shape.": "德鲁伊类有两个重要组成部分：法术和野性形状。在你认为合适的情况下，你可以自由地从你的德鲁伊类怪物中排除任何一个特征。特别强大的德鲁伊还可以通过 \"野性之形 \"在野兽形态下获得传统的特性，如攻击性、鲁莽和围攻怪。",
	"As a bonus action, the monster chooses one beast or plant it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the monster, the target uses its reaction to make one melee attack against a target that the monster can see.": "作为一个额外的动作，怪物在它30英尺范围内选择一个它能看到的野兽或植物。如果目标能听到怪物的声音，则目标用它的反应对怪物能看到的目标进行一次近战攻击。",
	"Each beast and plant of the monster's choice within 30 feet of it has advantage or disadvantage (monster's choice) on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.": "在它30英尺范围内的每只野兽和植物，在所有的攻击卷、能力检查和蓄势待发上都有优势或劣势（由怪物选择）。",
	"The druid can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.": "德鲁伊可以与野兽和植物交流，就像他们有共同的语言一样。",
	"Once on its turn, the monster can use 10 feet of its movement to magically step into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or larger.": "在它的回合中，怪物可以使用10英尺的移动距离，神奇地踏入她所能触及的一棵活树，并从第一棵树60英尺内的第二棵活树中出来，出现在第二棵树5英尺内的一个无人空间。两棵树都必须是大型或更大。",
	"The monster magically polymorphs into a beast or plant with a challenge rating as high as its virtual druid level divided by 3, and can remain in this form for a number of hours equal to half its virtual druid level. The monster can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The monster reverts to its true form if it dies or falls {@condition unconscious}. The monster can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.": "怪物会神奇地多态化为一种野兽或植物，其挑战等级与它的虚拟德鲁伊等级除以3一样高，并且可以在这种形态下保持相当于其虚拟德鲁伊等级一半的小时数。怪物可以选择它的装备是掉在地上，还是与它的新形态融为一体，或者被新形态所穿戴。如果怪物死亡或坠落，它将恢复到其真实形态（%0%）。怪物可以在它的回合中使用一个额外的动作恢复到它的真实形态。",
	"While in a new form, the monster retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.": "在进入新形态时，怪物保留其游戏统计信息和说话的能力，但是它的攻击力、移动模式、力量和灵巧会被新形态所取代，并获得新形态所具有但它所缺乏的任何特殊感觉、熟练度、特性、行动和反应（除了类特性、传奇行动和巢穴行动）。",
	"The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.": "为了克服对非魔法攻击的抵抗力和免疫力，新形态的攻击被算作魔法攻击。",
	"Fighters are among the easiest classes to give to a monster; most of them can just be added without any modification. That said, there are some other features that you can use to represent a fighter that aren't given by the class itself.": "斗士是最容易赋予怪物的类别之一；大多数斗士可以不经任何修改直接添加。也就是说，你可以用一些其他的特征来代表一个战士，而这些特征并不是由类本身赋予的。",
	"Once on each of its turns, the monster can deal an extra 7 ({@damage 2d6}) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the monster that isn't {@condition incapacitated}.": "在它的每个回合中，该怪物可以对它用武器攻击击中的生物造成额外的7（（%0%））伤害，如果该生物在该怪物的盟友5英尺内，而该盟友不是（%1%）。",

	"Rather than having to track spell slots and uses of Divine Smite, it is best to simply give a paladin monster the ability to passively deal radiant damage on its attacks. Otherwise, you are free to create abilities that represent an individual paladin's theme and divine power.": "与其追踪法术槽和神力打击的使用，不如简单地赋予圣骑士怪物被动地在其攻击中造成辐射伤害的能力。否则，你可以自由地创造代表个体圣骑士的主题和神力的能力。",

	"The ranger occupies a strange niche, overlapping with both the druid and the rogue in some of its themes, enabling you to give your ranger monsters features like Evasion and Uncanny Dodge. Another issue is that they are meant to be exploration based, which is extremely useless for monsters in nearly all cases. Thus, I encourage you to focus on how a ranger monster's interactions with nature influence both its martial prowess and its magical abilities.": "游侠占据了一个奇怪的位置，在某些主题上与德鲁伊和游侠重叠，使你能够给你的游侠怪物提供闪避和不思议躲避等功能。另一个问题是，他们的目的是基于探索，这对怪物来说几乎在所有情况下都是极其无用的。因此，我鼓励你关注游侠怪物与自然的互动如何影响其武功和魔法能力。",

	"While warlocks certainly make good enemies due to their story potential, the nature of their spell slots makes it much harder to balance them sometimes. I would personally suggest simply ditching pact slots for your warlock enemies and making them only use Innate Spellcasting (or regular slots, if you think that would be better), especially as invocation spells are already treated as innate spells. Otherwise, it is fairly easy to give a monster an invocation of your choice, whether it is an existing invocation or a new invocation of your own design.": "虽然术士因其故事潜力而成为很好的敌人，但他们的法术槽的性质使其有时更难平衡。我个人建议为你的术士敌人简单地抛弃契约槽，让他们只使用先天法术（或普通槽，如果你认为那会更好），特别是由于召唤法术已经被视为先天法术。否则，给怪物一个你选择的召唤是相当容易的，无论是现有的召唤还是你自己设计的新召唤。",

That said, the features below can instead be used to represent various arcane traditions.": "巫师可能是最容易表现的施法者，因为基础类几乎没有任何特征，而且并非所有的法师都需要独特的特征来表现特定的奥术传统（如果他们有的话）。也就是说，下面的特征反而可以用来代表各种奥术传统。",

	"Feats are an easy way to customize your monsters, as they are modular and independent of classes themselves. That said, they are designed for player use, which is reflected in their wording and limitations. But you don't have to abide by such limitations when making monster. So, I compiled a list of condensed traits and features that can be given to monsters to help represent the themes and ideas behind the feats we all know and love.": "特技是定制怪物的一个简单方法，因为它们是模块化的，并且独立于等级本身。也就是说，它们是为玩家设计的，这反映在其措辞和限制上。但是你在制作怪物时不必遵守这些限制。因此，我汇编了一份可以赋予怪物的浓缩特性和特征的清单，以帮助表现我们都知道和喜爱的功勋背后的主题和想法。",

	"Use the ability below to make this concept more active and interactive in combat.": "使用下面的能力，使这个概念在战斗中更加活跃和互动。",

	"Same as Durable.": "与持久性相同。",
	"While this may seem a bit strange at first, you can give an intelligent monster a background—either a sample background or a custom one—as described in the PHB. Doing so will flesh out the monster's backstory while also opening the door for future roleplay. It will also set a group of simple monsters apart from each other: for example, one bandit might be a {@background Variant Sailor (Pirate)|phb|sailor (pirate)} whose experience on the high seas allows them to navigate vehicles on water, while another bandit can be a {@background charlatan} that uses their false identity and deceptive skills to rob travelers on the road without actually having to fight them.": "虽然这起初看起来有点奇怪，但你可以给一个聪明的怪物一个背景--要么是样本背景，要么是PHB中描述的自定义背景。这样做可以充实怪物的背景故事，同时也为未来的角色扮演打开大门。这也会使一群简单的怪物彼此区别开来：例如，一个强盗可能是{@background Variant Sailor (Pirate)|phb|sailor (pirate)}，他们在公海上的经验使他们能够在水上驾驶车辆，而另一个强盗可以是{@background charlatan}，利用他们的假身份和欺骗技能在路上抢劫旅行者，而不必真正与他们战斗。",
	"As described in the DMG, you can give specific racial traits to your generic humanoid monsters to turn them into members of a specific race. The book describes how the player races from the PHB don't affect a monster's stat block, and also extends the approach to non-humanoid monsters like {@race skeleton|dmg|skeletons} and {@race zombie|dmg|zombies}.": "正如DMG中描述的那样，你可以给你的一般人形怪物赋予特定的种族特征，使它们变成特定种族的成员。本书描述了PHB中的玩家种族如何不影响怪物的状态块，并且还将这种方法扩展到非人形怪物，如（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"Racial feats are especially easy to add to a monster, as they don't usually change the monster's theme or behavior. Many of them can be added as-is, but be sure to use your judgement and to alter them as needed.": "种族特长特别容易添加到怪物身上，因为它们通常不会改变怪物的主题或行为。它们中的许多都可以按原样添加，但要确保使用你的判断力，并根据需要加以改变。",
	"The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg} describes a variety of {@5etools DM rewards|rewards.html} that are normally available to player characters: supernatural gifts such as blessings and charms, and epic boons that are designed for 20th level characters. Such rewards are also provided in books like {@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros|mot}, which provides supernatural gifts designed for 1st level characters and piety rewards for followers of specific gods.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}描述了各种通常可供玩家角色使用的{@5etools DM rewards|rewards.html}：超自然的礼物，如祝福和符咒，以及为20级角色设计的史诗性的奖励。这类奖励也在{@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros|mot}等书中提供，它提供为1级角色设计的超自然礼物和为特定神灵的追随者提供的虔诚奖励。",
	"Simply put, there is no reason you can't give these rewards to your monsters. For example, an extraordinarily powerful {@creature archmage} might have access to the {@reward Boon of High Magic}, while an evil {@creature assassin} that prays to Lolth might receive the {@reward Blessing of Weapon Enhancement}. Doing so also provides you with an opportunity for interactive storytelling about a monster's background, beliefs, and goals.": "简单地说，你没有理由不把这些奖励给你的怪物。例如，一个特别强大的（%0%）可能会获得（%1%），而一个向Lolth祈祷的邪恶（%2%）可能会获得（%3%）。这样做也为你提供了一个关于怪物的背景、信仰和目标的互动故事的机会。",
	"Now that we know the different roles and tiers that contribute to monster balancing and creation, we can focus on creating balanced groups of monsters that challenge the players in combat encounters.": "现在我们知道了有助于怪物平衡和创造的不同角色和层级，我们可以专注于创造平衡的怪物群，在战斗遭遇中挑战玩家。",
	"To understand the thought process behind encounter-building guidelines, it is essential to acknowledge the factors that influence an encounter's difficulty (other than a monster's difficulty).": "为了理解遭遇战建造指南背后的思考过程，必须承认影响遭遇战难度的因素（除了怪物的难度之外）。",
	"The concept of action economy is discussed earlier in this document. In encounter building, the action economy should be balanced as to not allow any side to be overwhelmingly superior to the the other, which creates one-sided stomps that might be inconsistent with the intended difficulty of the encounter.": "行动经济的概念在本文件的前面已经讨论过了。在遭遇战的构建中，行动经济应该是平衡的，不允许任何一方对另一方有压倒性的优势，这就造成了单方面的踩踏，可能与遭遇战的预期难度不一致。",
	"As a rule of thumb, {@b the monsters should never be inferior to the party in action economy}. For example, a monster with only three legendary actions (four effective actions total) can easily be dunked on by a party of five or more players, unless the monster is capable of targeting multiple characters with the majority of its abilities. When not dealing with legendary actions, this means that you should always have at least one monster for every player in the party.": "作为一个经验法则，（%0%）。例如，一个只有三个传奇行动（总共四个有效行动）的怪物可以很容易地被五个或更多玩家的队伍灌倒，除非这个怪物能够用它的大部分能力来针对多个角色。在不处理传奇行动时，这意味着你应该始终为队伍中的每个玩家至少配备一只怪物。",
	"It should be noted that some player characters might be capable of making more attacks than others on a given turn. The number of attacks a character can make per turn adds to its action economy, but other players will be just as effective. For example, a fighter with two attacks can be just as effective as a rogue with one attack, as the rogue deals extra damage via the Sneak Attack feature. Thus, while the number of possible player attacks shouldn't be ignored, it typically won't influence how difficult you should make an encounter.": "应该注意的是，有些玩家角色在某一回合可能比其他人能够进行更多的攻击。一个角色每回合可以进行的攻击次数会增加其行动经济，但其他玩家也会同样有效。例如，一个拥有两次攻击的战士和一个拥有一次攻击的游侠一样有效，因为游侠通过偷袭功能造成额外的伤害。因此，虽然不应该忽视玩家可能的攻击次数，但它通常不会影响你应该使一场遭遇战变得多么困难。",
	"The exception to this is when players, such as spellcasters, have access to abilities that have a large area of effect. For example, if the wizard of the party has the {@spell fireball} spell, that group will be able to take down a mob of skeletons very easily. Without the {@spell fireball} spell, the encounter might be a bit more challenging for the group, even if the party is otherwise identical. As such, area of effect powers are an essential balancing factor when creating an encounter.": "这方面的例外情况是，当玩家，如法术师，可以使用具有大面积效应的能力。例如，如果队伍中的巫师拥有{@spell fireball}的法术，那么这群人就能非常容易地干掉一群骷髅兵。如果没有{@spell fireball}的法术，即使队伍在其他方面都是一样的，这个遭遇对队伍来说可能会有点挑战性。因此，在创造一个奇遇时，效应区的力量是一个重要的平衡因素。",
	"Conversely, monsters that are more powerful tend to have multiple attacks at their disposal per round, while weaker monsters have less attacks and do less damage. This is mostly accounted for in their Challenge Rating, so as with players, it typically won't influence how difficult an encounter is unless you use a monster with access to numerous attacks per round or a monster that can use a powerful area of effect ability that can easily more than two players at once (as area of effect abilities are assumed to hit two players for the purposes of Challenge Rating).": "相反，更强大的怪物往往每回合有多次攻击，而较弱的怪物则攻击较少，伤害较小。这主要体现在它们的挑战等级中，所以和玩家一样，它通常不会影响一场遭遇战的难度，除非你使用的是每回合可以获得多次攻击的怪物，或者是可以使用强大的区域效应能力的怪物，而这种能力可以轻易地同时攻击两个以上的玩家（因为就挑战等级而言，区域效应能力是假定击中两个玩家）。",
	"With this in mind, minion-tier monsters tend to have very weak attacks that most characters can withstand easily. As such, {@b a minion's action is worth less than that of a stronger monster}, which is why it is acceptable to send large groups of minions at most adventuring partys.": "考虑到这一点，小兵级别的怪物往往具有非常弱的攻击力，大多数角色都能轻松抵御。因此，{@b a minion's action is worth less than that of a stronger monster}，这就是为什么在大多数冒险队伍中派大群小兵是可以接受的。",
	"If every fight took place in an open field, D&D would be a very easy game to excel at. But that is not always the case. The narrow hallways of a dungeon, the blinding depths of a raging blizzard, and the foggy bogs of a marshland are all possible sites for a combat to encounter.": "如果每场战斗都发生在空旷的场地上，D&D将是一个非常容易出彩的游戏。但情况并非总是如此。地牢的狭窄走廊、肆虐的暴风雪的刺眼深处、沼泽地的浓雾沼泽，都是战斗可能遇到的地点。",
	"As a rule of thumb, {@b the addition of a terrain feature or a similar effect increases an encounter's difficulty by one step}, unless the feature is carefully designed to be beneficial or neutral to both sides of the fight when taken advantage of. For example, kobolds might attempt to push the party into spike pits, but the party can also just push the kobolds into the pits instead.": "作为一个经验法则，{@b the addition of a terrain feature or a similar effect increases an encounter's difficulty by one step}，除非这个特征被精心设计成对战斗双方都有利或中立，当被利用的时候。例如，哥布林可能会试图将队伍推入钉子坑，但队伍也可以直接将哥布林推入坑中。",
	"Consider the following factors when designing an encounter and the area it takes place in.": "在设计一场遭遇战及其发生的区域时，要考虑以下因素。",
	"Difficult terrain and other types of movement-impairment have the potential to massively influence an otherwise easy. Some difficult terrain might also hinder the monsters, but some monsters might be immune to such features as appropriate.": "困难的地形和其他类型的移动障碍有可能对本来很容易的事情产生巨大的影响。一些困难的地形也可能会阻碍怪物，但有些怪物可能会适当地对这种特征免疫。",
	"Traps and hazards are objects or terrain features that either deal damage or inflict other negative effects on their victims. Such features can range from a concealed spike pit to a {@i sphere of annihilation}. The usage of traps and hazards will increase the offensive power of any side that uses them.": "陷阱和危险是对受害者造成伤害或造成其他负面影响的物体或地形特征。这种特征的范围可以从一个隐藏的钉子坑到一个{@i sphere of annihilation}。陷阱和危险的使用将增加任何使用它们的一方的攻击力。",
	"Keep in mind that darkvision isn't infallible. Lightly obscured areas, such as areas filled with fog or dim light, as well as darkness that is viewed by a creature with darkvision, impose disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks, making it easier for monsters to ambush the party. When areas are heavily obscured, either by total cover or by some other effect, most effects can't target them at all. A party that can't see can't act, greatly increasing the difficulty compared to the same encounter being ran in bright and clear conditions.": "请记住，暗视并不是无懈可击的。轻微遮蔽的区域，例如充满雾气或昏暗光线的区域，以及被暗视生物看到的黑暗，对智慧（（%0%））检查造成不利，使怪物更容易伏击队伍。当区域被严重遮蔽时，无论是完全遮蔽还是其他效果，大多数效果根本无法针对它们。看不见的队伍无法行动，与在明亮和清晰的条件下进行同样的遭遇相比，难度大大增加。",
	"Characters in 5th edition are not designed around having one fight per day. Such a structure makes classes with daily abilities (such as spell slots) extremely powerful, while leaving classes with abilities that recharge on a short rest (e.g. ki points) in the dust. Additionally, running only one fight per day allows for players to dump all of their resources into the fight, allowing them to take on threats that are much stronger than the party should normally be allowed to take on.": "第五版中的角色不是围绕着每天一场战斗来设计的。这样的结构使拥有日常能力（如法术槽）的等级变得非常强大，而使拥有在短暂休息时充能的能力（如气力点）的等级受到冷落。此外，每天只进行一场战斗允许玩家将他们所有的资源倾注到战斗中，使他们能够对付比通常情况下应该允许的党派更强大的威胁。",
	"As mentioned in the DMG, most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. This is a maximum, and not necessarily a recommendation. Six to eight encounters is a good target in dungeons crawling with random patrols and rooms filled with monsters. However, during a narrative-based game, not only can this amount of encounters per day interfere with the pacing of the game, but it might not be realistic based on the circumstances of the current story.": "正如DMG中提到的，大多数冒险队伍在一天内可以处理大约六到八个中等或困难的遭遇。这只是一个最大值，而不一定是建议。在爬满随机巡逻队和充满怪物的房间的地下城中，六到八次遭遇是个不错的目标。然而，在以叙事为基础的游戏中，每天这个数量的遭遇不仅会干扰游戏的节奏，而且根据当前故事的情况，它可能并不现实。",
	"With that in mind, the DMG offers a few fixes. Instead of throwing many easier encounters at the party, you can throw a few harder encounters at them. While this is a great solution for games that wish to be very difficult, keep in mind that overusing this approach might exhaust your players over time.": "考虑到这一点，DMG提供了一些修复方法。与其把许多较容易的遭遇扔给玩家，你可以把一些较难的遭遇扔给他们。虽然这对希望非常困难的游戏来说是一个很好的解决方案，但请记住，过度使用这种方法可能会使你的玩家在一段时间内筋疲力尽。",
	"Another approach is to extend the length of an adventuring day. For example, in a campaign that uses normal resting rules (rather than the {@variantrule Rest Variants|dmg|Gritty Realism} variant in the DMG), you can still abstract four to seven days of travel between locations as \"one adventuring day\", where each night of rest during their travels is considered a short rest. That way, you can throw one or two  encounters at your party each in-game day without the party using all of their resources to demolish the enemy with ease. You can then switch back to normal resting when in a settlement or dungeon setting.": "另一种方法是延长一个冒险日的长度。例如，在一个使用正常休息规则（而不是DMG中的（%0%）变体）的战役中，你仍然可以将四个到七个地点之间的旅行抽象为 \"一个冒险日\"，在他们旅行期间的每个夜晚的休息都被视为短暂休息。这样一来，你就可以在游戏中的每一天向你的队伍抛出一到两个遭遇战，而不需要队伍动用所有的资源来轻松地拆毁敌人。然后你可以在定居地或地牢的环境中切换回正常的休息状态。",
	"As a rule of thumb, {@b try to have at least three combat encounters per adventuring day, with two short rests spliced between them}. Having enough encounters to warrant two short rests per adventuring day is roughly the ideal way to balance short rest and long rest classes against each other. It makes D&D a resource conservation game, as intended: while a character could potentially use a powerful daily ability in a given fight, they have to weigh the benefits of doing so against the potential detriment of not having the ability available for later use.": "作为一个经验法则，（%0%）。在每个冒险日有足够的遭遇来保证两次短暂的休息，这大致是平衡短暂休息和长期休息类的理想方式。它使D&D成为一个资源节约型游戏，正如预期的那样：虽然一个角色有可能在特定的战斗中使用强大的日常能力，但他们必须权衡这样做的好处和没有能力供以后使用的潜在坏处。",
	"Not all adventuring parties are created equally. Some consist of multiple characters that are optimized for combat and/or are in possession of magic items that boost their combat effectiveness. Others are built for fun, and might not be able to handle the same deadly encounters optimized parties can easily stomp on.": "并非所有的冒险队伍都是一样的。有些人由多个角色组成，这些角色为战斗而优化，并且/或者拥有能提高其战斗力的魔法物品。另一些人则是为了好玩而生，他们可能无法处理那些经过优化的队伍可以轻易踩到的致命的遭遇。",
	"You know your party best. If you know your party is stronger or weaker compared to normal adventuring parties, feel free to adjust your encounters as you see fit.": "你最了解你的队伍。如果你知道你的队伍与普通的冒险队伍相比更强或更弱，请随意调整你的遭遇，因为你认为合适。",
	"While many creatures are wild beasts or otherwise have low Intelligence scores, others are equal to or better than the party in terms of intellect. Monsters that play smart, either by optimizing their ability usage or by taking advantage of terrain features and the like, are much more deadly than if ran as being more straightforward and simple. For more on monster tactics, see the Running Monsters chapter later in this document.": "虽然许多生物都是野兽或其他智力低下的生物，但其他的生物在智力方面相当于或优于当事人。聪明的怪物，无论是通过优化它们的能力使用还是通过利用地形特征和类似的东西，都比直接和简单的运行要致命得多。关于怪物战术的更多信息，请参见本文件后面的 \"运行怪物 \"章节。",
	"Conversely, some parties are very smart and tactical, while others are a bit clueless and disorganized. While some of this is influenced by the experience and intelligence of the players, a large portion of this also depends on the Intelligence and Wisdom scores of their characters. Keep in mind that parties with simpler tactics might not be able to handle as much as those who come up with more complex schemes and gambits.": "相反，有些党派非常聪明和有策略，而有些党派则有点无知和无组织。虽然这其中有一部分是受玩家的经验和智力影响的，但很大一部分也取决于他们角色的智力和智慧分数。请记住，战术比较简单的一方可能无法像那些想出更复杂的计划和赌法的一方那样处理。",
	"With the above factors in mind, let's create some encounter building systems you can use instead of the official ones. This first system leverages the tier system created": "考虑到上述因素，让我们创建一些你可以用来代替官方的奇遇建设系统。这第一个系统利用了创建的层级系统",
	"Lets use a modified form of {@b Giffyglyph's monster points (MP)} to build this encounter. First, let's determine our basic budget. We are going to take the number of characters in the party, add a constant based on other factors, and multiply this result by another constant determined by difficulty of the encounter:": "让我们使用修改后的{@b Giffyglyph's monster points (MP)}的形式来建立这种遭遇。首先，让我们确定我们的基本预算。我们要取党派中的人物数量，加上一个基于其他因素的常数，然后用这个结果乘以另一个由遭遇的难度决定的常数。",
	"Start by giving yourself an amount of MP equal to the number of characters in your party.": "开始时，给自己的MP数量等于你方阵中的角色数量。",
	"Now, go through each character in the party (including allied NPCs, if any). If the character has access to powerful area of effect abilities or other powers that are especially strong {@i when compared to the rest of the party}, you can add an additional 1 MP to the pool. This adjustment accounts for the character's larger influence on the action economy.": "现在，浏览一下党内的每个角色（包括盟友NPC，如果有的话）。如果该角色能获得强大的区域效应能力或其他特别强大的力量（%0%），你可以在池子里额外增加1个MP。这一调整说明该角色对行动经济的影响较大。",
	"Now that you have adjusted your budget based on your party's strength, we will take this amount of MP and multiply it by a constant based on the encounter difficulty.": "现在你已经根据你的队伍的实力调整了你的预算，我们将利用这个MP的数量，并根据遭遇的难度乘以一个常数。",
	"Medium": "中型",
	"Deadly": "致命的",

	"*By default, this cost assumes that four minions are roughly equivalent to one character. The first section already accounts for characters with access to particuarly potent abilities that can take out large groups of minions, so we don't have to consider that here. Instead, note that if you are using minions that are particularly weak or strong, you can change this cost to be 1/5 MP or 1/3 MP, respectively.": "*默认情况下，这个费用是假设四个小兵大致相当于一个角色。第一部分已经考虑到可以使用特别强大的能力的角色，这些能力可以干掉大群的小兵，所以我们在这里不必考虑这个问题。相反，请注意，如果你使用的是特别弱或特别强的小兵，你可以把这个费用分别改为1/5MP或1/3MP。",
	"The following quote from the DMG is relevant here: \"When making this calculation, don't count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the group unless you think the weak monsters significantly contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.\"": "以下是DMG中的一段话，与此相关。\"在进行这一计算时，不要计算那些挑战等级明显低于本组其他怪物的平均挑战等级的怪物，除非你认为这些弱小的怪物对遭遇战的难度有很大贡献。\"",

	"When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party's average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a 1st-level wizard with a single blow.": "在组织一场遭遇战或冒险时，尤其是在较低的级别，当使用挑战等级高于队伍平均水平的怪物时要谨慎。这样的怪物可能用一个动作就能造成足够的伤害，以消灭低级别的冒险者。例如，一个食人魔的挑战等级是2，但它可以一击杀死一个1级的巫师。",
	"In addition, some monsters have features that might be difficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. For example, a rakshasa has a challenge rating of 13 and is immune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th level or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, meaning that they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with their magic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. Such an encounter would be significantly tougher for the party than the monster's challenge rating might suggest.": "此外，有些怪物的特征对于低级别的角色来说可能很难或不可能克服。例如，罗刹的挑战等级为13，对6级及以下的法术免疫。12级或以下的法术师没有高于6级的法术，这意味着他们无法用他们的魔法影响罗刹，使冒险者处于严重的劣势。这样的遭遇将比怪物的挑战等级所显示的要难得多。",
	"Rather than having Lair Actions and terrain features increase the difficulty of an encounter, you can choose to have these factors be accounted for by assigning an MP cost to them. Adding Lair Actions to an encounter, whether they are attached to a single monster or are associated with a group of monsters or even the environment itself, costs 1 additional MP.": "与其让巢穴行动和地形特征增加遭遇战的难度，你可以选择让这些因素通过给它们分配一个MP成本而得到考虑。在遭遇战中添加巢穴行动，无论它们是与单个怪物相关，还是与一群怪物甚至环境本身相关，都需要额外花费1个MP。",
	"Additionally, note that reinforcements and summoned creatures influence MP just as normal monsters do, regardless of their stance in the fight. For example, if you have a druid in the party that can cast Conjure Animals, you can increase your MP budget based on how many creatures you anticipate will be summoned. Meanwhile, a demon that is summoned by a warlock or some other fiend costs MP as normal.": "此外，请注意，援军和召唤生物会像普通怪物一样影响MP，而不考虑它们在战斗中的立场。例如，如果你的队伍中有一个德鲁伊，可以施放 \"召唤动物\"，你可以根据你预计会召唤出多少生物来增加你的MP预算。同时，由术士或其他恶魔召唤出来的恶魔会像普通人一样消耗MP。",
	"Feel free to personalize your encounter as much as you'd like. Most of the time, you will have a general idea of what kind of monsters the encounter will consist of based on the narrative of your game.

	"The more you use this system, the better you will be at making approximations and changes as needed. Ideally, you won't need this system once you get the hang of balancing encounters for your specific party. As such, feel free to experiment: create an encounter, and make judgements as needed.

	"If you'd like, choose monsters with roles that you feel will adequately challenge your party. For example, an encounter consisting of a brute, a group of soldiers, and a few snipers will have multiple layers of tactical thinking to it: taking out the brute with single target attacks might be important, but if the soldiers aren't taken out in time, they have the potential to overwhelm the party via their numbers. Perhaps it would also be a good idea to take out the snipers, preventing them from dealing too much extra damage with impunity; with them gone, it might be much easier to take down the brute and the soldiers. Knowing what you know about your party's abilities (and their combat roles, if you will), encounter creation along these lines can allow for fun tactical thinking on both sides of the DM screen.": "如果你愿意，可以选择那些你认为能充分挑战你的队伍的怪物。例如，一个由野蛮人、一群士兵和几个狙击手组成的遭遇战会有多层次的战术思考：用单目标攻击干掉野蛮人可能很重要，但如果不及时干掉士兵，他们有可能通过人数优势压倒队伍。也许干掉狙击手也是一个好主意，可以防止他们肆无忌惮地造成过多的额外伤害；如果他们不在了，可能会更容易打倒蛮牛和士兵。在了解了你对你的队伍的能力（以及他们的战斗角色，如果你愿意的话）之后，按照这种思路创造的遭遇可以让DM屏幕上的双方进行有趣的战术思考。",

	"While this concept is a good one, the multipliers themselves make no sense. They start with one monster being times 1, scaling upwards as you add more monsters. But, we already know that solo monsters generally tend to get dogpiled. Shouldn't the multiplier of 1 apply when there are an equal number of combatants on both sides? Speaking of, why don't these multipliers account for varying party sizes at all? Finally, why are the multipliers presented for specific ranges of monster group sizes, causing significant gaps to form between them all?": "虽然这个概念很好，但乘数本身却毫无意义。它们从一个怪物的1倍开始，随着你添加更多的怪物而向上攀升。但是，我们已经知道，单独的怪物通常会被堆积起来。当双方有相同数量的战斗人员时，1的乘数不应该适用吗？说到这里，为什么这些乘数完全没有考虑到不同的队伍规模？最后，为什么这些乘数是针对特定范围的怪物群体大小提出的，导致它们之间形成明显的差距？",

If so, consider making a copy of {@link this|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKf8dBe9TaiT-wxX0Nys47_Z-hDA5Cx8OCLxgPSSXD4/edit?usp=sharing} spreadsheet of mine, which automates both of the Encounter Building methods detailed in this document.": "你是否觉得建造奇遇的行为本身很乏味？如果是这样的话，可以考虑制作一份我的{@link this|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKf8dBe9TaiT-wxX0Nys47_Z-hDA5Cx8OCLxgPSSXD4/edit?usp=sharing}电子表格，它可以将本文件中详述的两种奇遇构建方法自动化。",
	"So, you know how to create and balance a monster, and you know how to balance an encounter. But how do you actually run the encounter in game?": "所以，你知道如何创造和平衡一个怪物，你也知道如何平衡一个遭遇战。但是，你如何在游戏中实际操作这个遭遇呢？",
	"While combat is certainly fun as its own pillar of play, it needs to have a reason for occurring within the game world. When building an encounter, you need to establish the goals of all combatants, including the player characters.": "虽然战斗作为游戏本身的支柱当然很有趣，但它需要在游戏世界里有一个发生的理由。当建立一个遭遇战时，你需要建立所有战斗人员的目标，包括玩家角色。",
	"Monsters generally act as an obstacle that stand in the way of the party's goals. For example, a {@creature displacer beast} might try to interfere with the party's travels, or a band of {@creature kobold|mm|kobolds} might guard the lair of the red dragon the party seeks to slay. To make an encounter interesting, you can try to connect the encounter's circumstances to the party's goals in some way, even if the connection is indirect or incidental.": "怪物一般都是阻挡党的目标的障碍。例如，一个{@creature displacer beast}可能会试图干扰队伍的旅行，或者一帮{@creature kobold|mm|kobolds}可能会守卫队伍想要杀死的红龙的巢穴。为了使遭遇战变得有趣，你可以尝试将遭遇战的情况与党的目标以某种方式联系起来，即使这种联系是间接或偶然的。",
	"The players aren't the only creatures with goals in your setting. Even if their goals are simplistic or shallow, a monster will always have some sort of goal in mind when they initiate combat.": "在你的设定中，玩家并不是唯一有目标的生物。即使它们的目标很简单或很肤浅，怪物在发起战斗时总是有某种目标。",
	"Beasts and other animals with similar intellects will generally act on their innate desires to eat and defend themselves. Meanwhile, mindless undead like {@creature zombie|mm|zombies} and {@creature skeleton|mm|skeletons} will seek to kill all living beings unless they are ordered otherwise by their masters.": "野兽和其他具有类似智力的动物通常会根据它们与生俱来的欲望行事，吃东西和保护自己。同时，像{@creature zombie|mm|zombies}和{@creature skeleton|mm|skeletons}这样无意识的亡灵会寻求杀死所有的生物，除非他们的主人另有命令。",
	"In contrast, humanoids and other intelligent creatures usually have goals with a level of complexity equal to or greater than those of the party. A gang of {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} might notice the party's valuables and swoop in for a quick score, and an {@creature archdruid} might attempt to defend their sacred grove from the party's meddling. Even the compulsions of a mad {@creature cultist} are often guided by the influences of their dark master.": "相比之下，人形生物和其他智能生物的目标复杂程度通常等同于或高于党派的目标。一群{@creature bandit|mm|bandits}可能会注意到聚会的贵重物品，并为了快速得分而猛扑过来，而一个{@creature archdruid}可能会试图保护他们神圣的小树林不受聚会的干扰。即使是疯狂的{@creature cultist}的蛊惑，也常常受到他们黑暗主人的影响。",
	"Even if the different combatants have different goals, the amount of information each of them have can create a huge impact on how these goals are expressed.": "即使不同的战斗人员有不同的目标，他们每个人拥有的信息量也会对这些目标的表达方式产生巨大影响。",
	"For example, the party rogue might seek to avenge their father, but if they don't know the killer is the dashing noble they just passed on the street, initiative won't be rolled at all. Similarly, even the noblest of paladins can be tricked into thinking the party is evil and needs to be slain, despite their fact that they have a flawless track record.": "例如，当事人的流氓可能会寻求为他们的父亲报仇，但如果他们不知道凶手是他们刚刚在街上经过的那个潇洒的贵族，主动权就根本不会被滚动。同样地，即使是最高贵的圣骑士也会被骗，认为党派是邪恶的，需要被杀死，尽管他们有无懈可击的记录。",
	"Even if combat has already been initiated, certain information might influence the actions taken by each combatant. The party might be willing to pick a fight with a simple bandit brigade, but that would be different if they knew about the powerful dragon they serve under.": "即使战斗已经开始，某些信息也可能影响每个战斗人员采取的行动。党派可能愿意与一个简单的强盗大队挑起战斗，但如果他们知道他们所服务的强大的龙，那就不一样了。",
	"Whatever the case may be, whenever you design an encounter, be sure to account for what the combatants know, which is separate than what the DM knows.": "不管是什么情况，每当你设计一场遭遇战时，一定要考虑到战斗人员所知道的情况，这与DM知道的情况是不同的。",
	"It is clear from the last section that when monsters encounter the party, they aren't necessarily out for blood. Monsters have their own goals, which can influence when and how combat is initiated and resolved.": "从上一节可以看出，当怪物遇到聚会时，它们不一定是为了流血而来。怪物们有自己的目标，这可能会影响到何时以及如何发起和解决战斗。",
	"Initiative is usually rolled when combat starts, but it can also be rolled just beforehand. If the players encounter one or more monsters that aren't immediately hostile, you can have them roll initative so that you can properly resolve each of their actions sequentially.": "主动权通常是在战斗开始时掷出的，但也可以在战斗前掷出。如果玩家遇到一个或多个不是立即敌对的怪物，你可以让他们掷出主动权，这样你就可以按顺序正确解决他们的每个行动。",
	"Suppose the party and a {@creature displacer beast} come across each other in a forest. Initiative is rolled, but on its turn, the displacer beast doesn't attack. Even though the displacer beast is evil and hunts for sport, it knows that it is outnumbered, and that isn't hidden like it would prefer. Instead of attacking, the beast slowly backs off and retreats into the woods. If the party obliges, the combat then ends... that is, until the displacer beast returns to stealthily hunt the party alongside its pack.": "假设党和一只{@creature displacer beast}在森林中遇到了对方。主动权被掷出，但在它的回合中，流离兽并没有攻击。尽管流离兽是邪恶的，以狩猎为乐，但它知道它的数量比别人多，而且这并不像它所希望的那样隐藏。这只野兽没有攻击，而是慢慢地退后，退到了树林里。如果一方同意，战斗就会结束......也就是说，直到流离失所的野兽回来，与它的族群一起悄悄地猎杀一方。",
	"Intelligent creatures in particular are prone to not attacking immediately. Despite its bloodlust, a demon might ignore the party altogether, instead continuing to carry out its masters orders. A passing bandit brigade might allow the party to pass if they aren't in any position to shake them down. Even an insane cultist might yell gibberish at the party in an attempt to get them to leave. That said, some adventuring parties might choose to attack immediately in all three of these scenarios. If that happens, the monsters will be forced to defend themselves and counterattack as appropriate.": "聪明的生物尤其容易不立即发动攻击。尽管恶魔嗜血，但它可能完全无视这支队伍，而是继续执行其主人的命令。一个路过的强盗大队可能会允许队伍通过，如果他们没有任何地位可以撼动他们。即使是一个疯狂的邪教徒也可能对着队伍大喊大叫，试图让他们离开。也就是说，在上述三种情况下，有些冒险队伍可能会选择立即攻击。如果发生这种情况，怪物们将被迫自卫，并酌情反击。",
	"If you got in a brawl, would you fight to the death? For the average D&D monster, the answer is no.": "如果你们发生了争吵，你们会拼命吗？对于一般的D&D怪物来说，答案是否定的。",
	"Instead of meeting a bloody end, a {@creature displacer beast} might run away, or a group of {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} might lay down their arms and surrender. Even if they have malicious intentions or want to seek revenge at a later date, they would rather lose a single battle than render their lives forfeit.": "与其遭遇血腥的结局，一个{@creature displacer beast}可能会逃跑，或者一群{@creature bandit|mm|bandits}可能会放下武器投降。即使他们有恶意，或想在以后的日子里寻求报复，他们也宁愿输掉一场战斗，而不是让自己的生命被剥夺。",
	"On the other hand, mindless constructs, oozes, plants, undead, and other creatures might not have the mental capacity to retreat. Others might possess goals that lead them to fight to the death.": "另一方面，无意识的构造物、渗出物、植物、亡灵和其他生物可能没有撤退的心理能力。其他人可能拥有导致他们战斗到死的目标。",
	"Similarly, if the entire party agrees that they are in over their heads, end the initiative order and allow them to retreat. If the monsters wish to continue fighting, shift to the chase rules detailed in the DMG.": "同样地，如果整个队伍都同意他们陷入了困境，那么就结束主动权命令，允许他们撤退。如果怪物们希望继续战斗，则转为DMG中详述的追击规则。",
	"The behavior of a monster in combat can be determined by a number of factors.": "怪物在战斗中的行为可以由许多因素决定。",
	"The dominant factor that influences a monster's behavior in combat is its individual features and abilities. {@link The Monsters Know What They're Doing|https://www.themonstersknow.com/} is a blog that discusses a variety of tactics that can be used by specific types of monsters in combat. I recommend checking that blog out if you want tactical advice for specific monster types.": "影响怪物在战斗中的行为的主导因素是它的个体特征和能力。{@link The Monsters Know What They're Doing|https://www.themonstersknow.com/}是一个讨论特定类型怪物在战斗中可以使用的各种战术的博客。如果你想获得特定怪物类型的战术建议，我推荐你去看看那个博客。",
	"We can use a monster's mental ability scores to build a profile for its behavior in combat. Each section below will discuss the general behavior of a monster based on the numerical range its ability scores fall under.": "我们可以使用一个怪物的精神能力分数来建立一个它在战斗中的行为档案。下面的每一节都将根据怪物的能力分数所处的数值范围来讨论其一般行为。",
	"A monster's Wisdom score represents its mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and ability to reason. It also represents the sum of all the knowledge it possesses and and can potentially use to its advantage.": "一个怪物的智慧值代表它的精神敏锐度、回忆的准确性和推理能力。它也代表了它所拥有的所有知识的总和，并且可以潜在地利用它的优势。",
	"The monster most likely cannot speak or understand any languages, and is incapable of using any proper tactics in combat. It has a poor memory and will act only on instinct (or the commands given to it).": "这种怪物很可能不会说或听不懂任何语言，也没有能力在战斗中使用任何适当的战术。它的记忆力很差，只会根据本能（或给它的命令）行事。",
	"The monster might have a rudimentary understanding of language, but will not have the intellect required to build or create anything more than a simple shelter. If it can be communicated with, it is easily confused by anything more than a superficial overview of basic concepts.": "怪物可能对语言有初步的理解，但不会有建造或创造任何东西的智力，而只是一个简单的住所。如果可以与它交流，它也很容易被任何超过基本概念的表面概述所迷惑。",
	"The monster has a general sense of deductive reasoning and can use that reasoning to solve puzzles and to determine what course of action it should take in combat. However, the monster might have trouble thinking ahead or making more than a handful of logical connections at the same time.": "怪物具有一般的演绎推理意识，可以用这种推理来解决谜题，并确定在战斗中应该采取的行动方案。然而，该怪物可能难以超前思考，或在同一时间内做出超过少数的逻辑联系。",
	"The monster can use logic to extrapolate missing information, think ahead and strategize, and can apply knowledge drawn from its previous experiences to the current situation.": "怪物可以用逻辑推断出缺失的信息，提前思考并制定策略，并能将从以前的经验中得出的知识应用于当前的情况。",
	"The monster has an above average understanding of logic and possesses plenty of knowledge regarding multiple topics. In combat, the monster can overcome the obstacles ahead of it by recalling specific information about its enemies and predicting what actions they will take ahead of time.": "该怪物对逻辑的理解高于平均水平，并拥有关于多个主题的大量知识。在战斗中，怪物可以通过回忆敌人的具体信息并提前预测他们会采取什么行动来克服前面的障碍。",
	"The monster is smarter than most humanoid creatures, and may possess an intricate understanding of a wide variety of topics. It can think many steps ahead of most combatants and can plan multiple courses of action to take depending on the behavior of its enemies.": "这种怪物比大多数人形生物更聪明，可能拥有对各种主题的错综复杂的理解。它能比大多数战斗人员提前许多步思考，并能根据敌人的行为计划采取多种行动方案。",
	"The monster's Intellgence is high enough to rival dragons, planar rulers, and even some deities. In combat, it can apply its vast amount of knowledge to almost any situation it comes across.": "这种怪物的智力高到足以与龙、星球统治者，甚至一些神灵相媲美。在战斗中，它可以将其大量的知识应用于它所遇到的几乎任何情况。",
	"A monster's Wisdom score represents its intuition and its awareness of the world around it. It also represents how well the monster can apply the information it has to the situation at hand.": "怪物的智慧得分代表它的直觉和对周围世界的认识。它也代表了怪物能将它所掌握的信息应用到手头的情况中的程度。",
	"The monster is unable to distinguish different creatures from one another without external aid, or it doesn't acknowledge the existence of creatures other than its specific target. Instead of avoiding terrain hazards, the monster might walk straight through them, even if doing so would harm it.": "如果没有外界的帮助，怪物无法区分不同的生物，或者它不承认除其特定目标以外的生物的存在。怪物不避开地形障碍物，而是直接穿过它们，即使这样做会伤害它。",
	"The monster might have a limited understanding of teamwork and cooperation, and can possibly distinguish friend from foe, but it will probably remain oblivious to its surroundings. The creature will also have a semblance of self-preservation and might retreat from battle in certain cases.": "这种怪物可能对团队精神和合作有有限的理解，并可能区分朋友和敌人，但它可能会对周围的环境保持漠不关心。这种生物也会有一定的自我保护意识，在某些情况下可能会从战斗中退缩。",
	"The monster will actively avoid any obvious terrain hazards and ensure its own survival as needed. And while it may be able to distinguish certain foes from one another, it might not have a clear understanding of the intentions behind their actions. The monster will also be able to use teamwork as needed.": "怪物会主动避开任何明显的地形危险，并根据需要确保自己的生存。而且，虽然它可能能够将某些敌人区分开来，但它可能对他们行动背后的意图并不清楚。怪物也将能够根据需要使用团队合作。",
	"The monster has a general awareness of the area around it and may take advantage of it when needed. It will be able to read any obvious body language, as well as other signs of the intentions behind another creature's behavior. The monster will also properly recognize its own behavior and how that behavior affects others.": "怪物对它周围的区域有一般的认识，在需要时可能会利用它。它将能够读懂任何明显的身体语言，以及另一个生物行为背后的意图的其他迹象。怪物也会正确认识自己的行为以及这种行为对他人的影响。",
	"The monster has an above average awareness of the world around it and can keep track of the battle at hand. Its intuition will allow it to understand the bigger picture of the surrounding battle and will know when to retreat or to press onwards.": "怪物对周围的世界有高于平均水平的认识，可以跟踪手头的战斗。它的直觉会让它了解周围战斗的大局，并知道何时撤退或继续前进。",
	"The monster is wiser than most humanoid creatures, and is capable of outwitting them with ease. Unless a creature is extraordinarily deceptive or intelligent, the monster will be able to read its true intentions with little effort. In battle, it will know the general steps it should take in order to come out on top.": "怪物比大多数人形生物更聪明，能够轻松地骗过它们。除非一个生物具有特别的欺骗性或智慧，否则怪物将能够不费吹灰之力就读懂它的真实意图。在战斗中，它将知道自己应该采取的一般步骤，以便取得胜利。",
	"The monster's Wisdom is high enough to rival dragons, planar rulers, and even some deities. In combat, it will be able to use the information it has to achieve the most favorable outcome possible.": "怪物的智慧高到足以与龙、星球统治者，甚至一些神祗相媲美。在战斗中，它将能够利用它所掌握的信息来达到最有利的结果。",
	"In combat, a monster's morale will determine its confidence and whether or not it wants to retreat. You can use or take inspiration from the {@variantrule Morale} optional rule to determine whether or not a creature retreats in a dire situation.": "在战斗中，怪物的士气将决定它的信心以及它是否要撤退。你可以使用或借鉴{@variantrule Morale}的可选规则来决定一个生物在危急情况下是否退却。",
	"Most battles don't take place in empty fields or corridors. They often involve obstacles that grant cover and break line of sight, as well as hazards that the combatants must avoid in order to survive. And on the monsters' home turf, a battle might even include the use of clever traps and siege weapons against unsuspecting adventurers.": "大多数战斗并不是在空旷的场地或走廊上进行的。它们往往涉及到能够提供掩护和破坏视线的障碍物，以及战斗人员为了生存而必须避免的危险。在怪物的主场，一场战斗甚至可能包括使用巧妙的陷阱和围攻武器来对付毫无戒心的冒险者。",
	"Traps are generally made to hinder adventurers and other creatures from traversing through a specific location. However, they can also be used by monsters in the middle of a combat encounter. For example, a deep pit with spikes at the bottom can be cloaked by illusion magic to trick the adventurers into walking into it, but the monsters can also attempt to shove the adventurers into the pit after surprising them in combat.": "陷阱一般是用来阻碍冒险者和其他生物穿越特定地点的。然而，它们也可以在战斗遭遇中被怪物使用。例如，一个底部有尖刺的深坑可以用幻觉魔法隐蔽起来，欺骗冒险者走进去，但怪物也可以在战斗中给冒险者一个惊喜后，试图把他们推入坑中。",
	"Whether you are looking for a list of example traps or rules for making custom ones, {@book Dungeon Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge} includes a comprehensive discussion of traps that I would definitely recommend looking into.": "无论你是在寻找一个例子陷阱清单，还是在寻找制作自定义陷阱的规则，{@book Dungeon Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge}包括对陷阱的全面讨论，我绝对会推荐你去看。",
	"When inserting a trap into an encounter, keeping the following factors in mind:": "在遭遇战中插入陷阱时，要牢记以下因素。",
	"If the monsters made the trap themselves or have had time to experiment with it, they will generally know how to optimize its usage. However, if they aren't too familiar with it, the monsters might use it inefficiently, and even have a chance of harming themselves in the process.": "如果怪物们自己制作了陷阱，或者有时间对其进行实验，他们一般会知道如何优化其使用。但是，如果它们对它不是太熟悉，怪物们可能会低效地使用它，甚至有机会在这个过程中伤害到自己。",
	"A single trap generally doesn't kill in one hit. It may deal some damage, but it is far more likely that the trap will also impose some sort of condition or other disadvantage that the monsters can capitalize on. For example, if the group of monsters manage to shove the adventurers into the pit of spikes, they can follow up by pouring flaming oil onto these pour souls.": "单一的陷阱一般不会一击毙命。它可能会造成一些伤害，但更有可能的是，陷阱还会施加某种条件或其他不利因素，让怪物们可以利用。例如，如果这群怪物设法将冒险者推入钉子坑，它们就可以在这些倒下的灵魂上浇上燃烧的油。",
	"The monsters aren't the only ones that can take advantage of a trap. With a keen eye and a sharp wit, it may be possible for the adventurers to turn around and use the trap against the monsters. For example, if the monsters fail to shove the adventurers into the pit of spikes, they in turn might be shoved into it by the adventurers.": "怪物并不是唯一可以利用陷阱的人。只要有敏锐的眼光和机智的头脑，冒险者就有可能转过身来，利用陷阱对付怪物。例如，如果怪物没能把冒险者推入钉子坑，它们反过来可能会被冒险者推入坑中。",
	"Hazards are similar to traps in function, but are generally not designed or created by any given creature. They also tend to be passive or constantly on, as opposed to the active nature of most traps. With this in mind, you can treat hazards as being similar to traps for the purpose of including them in an encounter.": "危害在功能上与陷阱相似，但通常不是由任何特定的生物设计或创造的。它们也往往是被动的或持续的，与大多数陷阱的主动性质相反。考虑到这一点，你可以把危险当作类似于陷阱的东西来处理，以便把它们纳入一场遭遇战。",
	"As discussed in the \"Customizing an Existing Monster\" section earlier in this document, you can outfit your monsters with mundane or magical items in order to make them more memorable. Remember that the availability and effects of these items will influence the behavior of a monster that wields them. For example, a {@creature goblin} with a {@item potion of healing|dmg} might retreat momentarily in order to drink it, while an {@creature ogre} that consumes a {@item potion of invulnerability} will probably be much more confident and reckless than a regular ogre.": "正如本文前面的 \"定制现有的怪物 \"一节所讨论的，你可以为你的怪物配备平凡的或神奇的物品，以使它们更令人难忘。请记住，这些物品的可用性和效果会影响使用它们的怪物的行为。例如，一个拥有（%1%）的（%0%）可能会为了喝下它而暂时退缩，而一个消耗了（%3%）的（%2%）可能会比普通食人魔更加自信和鲁莽。",
	"Even outside of large-scale warfare, you can arm your monsters with powerful {@5etools siege weapons|objects.html} that can give the adventurers a run for their money. Perhaps the outer walls of the {@creature lich}'s castle are guarded by ballistae-wielding {@creature skeleton|mm|skeletons}, or a devious group of {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} have positioned a suspended cauldron of green slime over a bridge to pour on any unsuspecting travelers that try to pass under it.": "即使在大规模的战争之外，你也可以用强大的（%0%）来武装你的怪物，让冒险者们大开眼界。也许(1%)城堡的外墙由挥舞着弹弓的(2%)守卫着，或者一群狡猾的(3%)在桥上放置了一个悬浮的绿色粘液大锅，向任何试图从桥下通过的毫无防备的旅行者倾泻。",

Thus, some ballista variants opt to change the weapon's firing mechanism instead of the projectile itself.": "{@object ballista|dmg|Ballistae}的设计和它们通常发射的弹丸与弩类似。因此，一些弹道导弹变种选择改变武器的发射机制，而不是弹丸本身。",

While impaled, the target can't take any action on its turn other than trying to free itself from the harpoon, which requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) piercing damage as the harpoon is pulled free and is no longer impaled. If an action was used to attach the harpoon to the gun by a rope before it was fired, a creature impaled on that harpoon can't move farther away from the gun or increase its altitude until it frees itself. A creature within reach of the gun's winch can use its action to reel in a harpooned creature, pulling it up to 20 feet closer to the gun.": "{@atk rw} {@hit 6}击中，范围120/480英尺，一个目标。{@h} 16 ({@damage 3d10})穿刺伤害，并且目标被刺穿。当被刺穿时，目标在其回合内不能采取任何行动，除了试图从鱼叉中解脱出来，这需要成功进行DC15力量检查。如果检定成功，目标在鱼叉被拉出时受到5（4%）的穿刺伤害，并且不再被刺穿。如果在发射前用绳索将鱼叉固定在枪上，被鱼叉刺中的生物不能远离枪，也不能增加其高度，直到它释放自己。在枪的绞盘范围内的生物可以用它的行动来卷住被鱼叉夹住的生物，把它拉到离枪最多20英尺的地方。",

Speaking of, why don't these multipliers account for varying party sizes at all? Finally, why are the multipliers presented for specific ranges of CRs, causing significant gaps to form between them all?": "虽然这个概念很好，但乘数本身却毫无意义。它们从一个怪物的1倍开始，随着你添加更多的怪物而向上攀升。但是，我们已经知道，单独的怪物通常会被堆积起来。当双方有相同数量的战斗人员时，1的乘数不应该适用吗？说到这里，为什么这些乘数完全没有考虑到不同的队伍规模？最后，为什么这些乘数是针对特定范围的CRs提出的，导致它们之间形成明显的差距？",
