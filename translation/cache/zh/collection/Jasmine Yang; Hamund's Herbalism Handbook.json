	"If you have ever played an open world fantasy RPGgame, chances are that it included some sort of mechanic to gather plants and herbs as you roam through the map. Other than providing useful buffs and abilities to the player, these herbs also serve as little pieces of worldbuilding—changing availability as the environment does, or serving as quest items for NPCs.": "如果你曾经玩过开放世界的奇幻RPG游戏，那么它很可能包括某种机制，当你在地图上漫游时可以收集植物和草药。除了为玩家提供有用的BUFF和能力之外，这些草药还可以作为世界建设的小部分--随着环境的变化而改变可用性，或者作为NPC的任务物品。",
	"This book aims to provide that same experience, as well as to serve the needs of any DM whose players constantly ask them if they can forage something while out travelling between quest locations. This book contains over 160 unique herbs, designed to be usable in any campaign that a DM can slot in to provide a whole new dimension of exploration and world building to their games. There's also rules for foraging, some new spells, and a couple extra goodies.": "本书旨在提供同样的体验，同时也为那些在任务地点之间旅行时经常问他们是否可以觅食的DM的需求服务。本书包含160多种独特的草药，旨在让管理员可以在任何活动中使用，为他们的游戏提供一个全新的探索和世界建设维度。书中还有觅食的规则，一些新的法术，以及一些额外的好东西。",

	"Welcome dear reader to a brand new series of learning and adventure, brought to you by none other than I, Sir Hamund Holderhek! On the off chance that my published works have yet to reach you, let me say that I am a writer by trade, but an explorer at heart.

	"I have scaled peaks that pierce the heavens, trekked across sands scorched by sun, and plunged into depths that border the Hells themselves, and through all of it I have marvelled at what nature has to show to me each time. For this volume in particular however, I have chosen to focus on nature's more understated, yet crucial gifts: plants and herbs.": "我曾攀登过刺破天际的山峰，跋涉过被太阳烤焦的沙地，也曾坠入与地狱接壤的深渊，通过这一切，我每次都对大自然向我展示的东西感到惊叹。然而，在这一卷中，我选择将重点放在大自然更低调，但却至关重要的礼物上：植物和草药。",
	"Within this book is the compilation of copious amounts of travel notes, interacting with and consuming every magical plant ranging from the mighty mountain heart ginseng, to the mirthful sillypad. Within these pages you will find not only an exhaustive compendium of useful plants and herbs you may find on your travels, but also instructions on how to forage for them, how to brew them into powerful tinctures, new spells to add to your arsenals, and also my many humorous thoughts and musings.

	"Good luck and good harvesting,": "祝你好运，收获愉快。",
	"Any magical plant (and even some plant adjacent organisms like mushrooms and lichen) are considered {@b herbs}. Herbs can be found in virtually every environment, even using their magical nature to survive in places that would be inhospitable to more mundane plants. Their effects vary widely and some are much rarer and more useful than others, but all have their own value in their own ways. The following section details the basic rules for finding herbs and how to use them.": "任何神奇的植物（甚至一些与植物相邻的生物体，如蘑菇和地衣）都被认为是（%0%）。几乎在每一个环境中都能找到草药，甚至利用它们的魔法性质在那些对更多世俗植物来说是不适宜的地方生存。它们的效果千差万别，有些比其他的更稀有、更有用，但都有自己的价值，有自己的方式。以下部分详细介绍了寻找草药的基本规则以及如何使用它们。",
	"Collecting a herb is known as {@b gathering}, which is further broken down into two different methods: {@b foraging} and {@b picking}.": "采集草药被称为（%0%），进一步细分为两种不同的方法：（%1%）和（%2%）。",
	"Foraging refers to wandering through one's environment and simply gathering whatever they may come across. It may be done as a downtime activity, or while the party is travelling at a normal or slower pace. For every 8 hours that a character spends foraging, they may make a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check, with the results determined by the table below. Results are cumulative: each row's results also earn the foraging character the results of the rows above it.": "觅食是指在一个人的环境中徘徊，简单地收集他们可能遇到的任何东西。它可以作为一种休息时间的活动，或者在队伍以正常或较慢的速度旅行时进行。角色每花8小时进行一次觅食，就可以进行一次智慧（（%0%））检查，结果由下表决定。结果是累积的：每一行的结果也使觅食的角色获得它上面几行的结果。",
	"Picking refers to actively searching out a specific herb by tracking through the environment and looking for signs of where the herb may be. This may only be done as a downtime activity.": "采摘是指通过追踪环境并寻找草药可能所在的迹象，积极寻找特定的草药。这可能只是作为一种休息时间的活动。",
	"In order to go picking for a herb, a player must declare which herb they are looking for and then spend the next 8 hours attempting to find it, at the end of which they may make a {@dc 25} Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. A player may only attempt to pick a herb that is in the same environment table as the environment the player is currently in.": "为了去采摘草药，玩家必须声明他们正在寻找的草药，然后花8个小时试图找到它，最后他们可以做一个{@dc 25}智慧({@skill Survival})检查。玩家只能尝试采摘与玩家当前所处环境相同的环境表中的草药。",
	"On a success they find the herb they were looking for. On a failure, it is deemed that the herb cannot be found in the local area and they must travel for a full day before they, or anyone in their party, may attempt to pick the same herb again.": "如果成功，他们就能找到他们要找的草药。如果失败，则被认为在当地找不到该草药，他们必须旅行一整天，然后他们或他们队伍中的任何人才可以再次尝试采摘同样的草药。",
	"The {@spell locate animals and plants} spell allows a player to name a plant and be told where it is so long as it exists within a 5 mile radius of their current location. While this is a rather innocuous spell in the base game, when it comes to finding herbs it can be quite powerful in finding the rarer herbs, and potentially cause contention since it would rely on DM fiat to decide if that herb is present or not. To avoid this, DMs can use the table below to determine the herb's availability, based on the probability of the herb's rarity in their environment table.": "{@spell locate animals and plants}法术允许玩家命名一种植物，并被告知它在哪里，只要它存在于他们当前位置的5英里半径内。虽然在基本游戏中这是一个相当无害的法术，但当涉及到寻找草药时，它在寻找较稀有的草药时可能会相当强大，并有可能引起争论，因为它将依赖DM的命令来决定该草药是否存在。为了避免这种情况，管理员可以使用下表，根据环境表中草药的稀有性概率来确定草药的可用性。",
	"To use the table, the player {@action cast a spell|PHB|casting the spell} must roll a {@dice d100}. If they roll equal to or above the number listed next to the herb they are trying to locate's corresponding position on their herb table, then the herb is present and the spell leads them to it.": "要使用这个表格，玩家{@action cast a spell|PHB|casting the spell}必须掷出{@dice d100}。如果他们掷出的数字等于或高于他们试图找到的草药在草药表上的相应位置所列出的数字，那么该草药就存在，而且法术会引导他们找到它。",
	"Note that this table only applies to special herbs. If your players wish to find many common herbs, that should have little impact on game balance.": "请注意，此表只适用于特殊药材。如果你的玩家希望找到许多普通的草药，这对游戏平衡应该没有什么影响。",
	"Herbs may be used much like any other item, with their description detailing how to use them, how long it takes to use them, and the effects they bestow.": "草药可以像其他物品一样使用，其描述中详细说明了如何使用它们，使用它们需要多长时间，以及它们赋予的效果。",
	"A creature may only be under the effect of one herb ata time. If a creature attempts to use a new herb on themselves while still under the effect of another, the first herb's effects end immediately.": "一个生物每次只能受到一种草药的影响。如果一个生物试图在自己身上使用一种新的草药，而同时仍处于另一种草药的效果之下，那么第一种草药的效果会立即结束。",
	"Many herbs are quick and simple to apply, usually just using an action to eat them or spending a bit of time rubbing their juices on one's equipment. However, other herbs require a much longer and more involved process—needing to be smoked, boiled, peeled, burned, etc. before they become usable. Herbs that require a process such as this are said to {@b require preparation}.": "许多草药的应用是快速而简单的，通常只是用一个动作来吃它们，或花一点时间把它们的汁液抹在自己的设备上。然而，其他草药则需要一个更长、更复杂的过程--需要经过熏制、煮沸、去皮、烧制等，然后才能使用。需要这样一个过程的草药被称为（%0%）。",
	"To prepare a herb, a character must have a {@item herbalism kit|PHB} in their possession and spend an hour during a short or long rest processing the herb appropriately. This is considered a light and non-strenuous activity for the purpose of calculating rest requirements. If done during a short rest, that character may still recover hit points by expending hit die as usual. Once the rest has been finished, the herb must be used immediately. The character preparing the herb and the character using the herb do not need to be the same—one character can prepare the herb, while another uses it at the end of the rest.": "要准备一种草药，一个角色必须拥有一个{@item herbalism kit|PHB}的草药，并在短期或长期的休息中花一个小时适当地处理该草药。在计算休息要求时，这被认为是一种轻度和非剧烈的活动。如果是在短时休息期间进行，该角色仍然可以像往常一样通过消耗命中模来恢复命中点。一旦休息结束，必须立即使用该草药。准备草药的角色和使用草药的角色不需要是同一个人--一个角色可以准备草药，而另一个角色在休息结束后使用它。",
	"This section contains the list of more than 160 herbs created for this book, as well as an explanation of how to read a herb's entry.": "本节包含为本书创建的160多种草药的清单，以及对如何阅读草药条目的解释。",
	"The name of the herb, listed in alphabetical order.": "草药的名称，按字母顺序排列。",
	"This section denotes whether or not a herb needs preparation before it can be used ({@book described in more detail in Chapter 2|HHbH|2|Preparing Herbs}).": "这一部分表示一种草药在使用前是否需要准备（（%0%））。",
	"A description of the herb written by Hamund. While these are usually just flavour, they also often inform the player how the herb is applied which may impact very specific game scenarios.": "由Hamund撰写的草药描述。虽然这些通常只是味道，但它们也经常告知玩家如何应用该草药，这可能会影响非常具体的游戏场景。",
	"Specific herbs grow in specific environments, having grown to adapt to their surroundings. This section lists which environment the herb can be found in, which is also the herb environment table for where they can be rolled.": "特定的草药生长在特定的环境中，已经成长为适应周围环境的植物。本节列出了该草药可以在哪种环境中找到，这也是它们可以被轧制的草药环境表。",
	"Although the herbs listed in this guide are meant to be findable in most locations, the DM has full discretion to determine if an environment is completely devoid of plant life and thus unsuitable for finding any herbs. Locations like this may include the peaks of mountains, in the middle of the ocean, the depths of the Nine Hells, etc.": "尽管本指南中列出的草药在大多数地方都可以找到，但管理员有充分的自由裁量权来决定一个环境是否完全没有植物生命，因而不适合寻找任何草药。这样的地点可能包括山峰、海洋中央、九层地狱的深处，等等。",
	"In other cases, the DM may decide that plants can grow in an environment, but due to various circumstances, their availability may be limited—such as during a severe drought, or while travelling through the mostly barren lands of the Shadowfell. In these cases, the DC for gathering all herbs is increased by 5. Similarly, if the players are in an environment in which plant life is extremely abundant—such as the forests of the Feywild—then the DC for gathering all herbs are lowered by 5.": "在其他情况下，DM可能会决定植物可以在某个环境中生长，但由于各种情况，它们的可用性可能会受到限制--比如在严重的干旱期间，或者在穿越阴影地带的大部分不毛之地时。在这种情况下，采集所有草药的DC会增加5。同样，如果玩家所处的环境中植物资源极其丰富--比如精灵世界的森林--那么采集所有草药的DC会降低5。",
	"The effect that the herb imparts once used. Some are destructive, single-use items, while others have beneficial effects that can be used repeatedly. If a herb lists a number of charges based on a dice roll, these charges are rolled for when the herb is first gathered.": "草药一旦使用就会产生的效果。有些是破坏性的、一次性使用的物品，而有些则具有有益的效果，可以反复使用。如果一种草药列出了基于掷骰子的费用数量，这些费用在第一次采集草药时就会被掷出。",
	"Herbalism is not simply wandering around and picking pretty flowers! Herbalism is a holistic trade with many facets that people can spend lifetimes to master. I present some of these extra facets to you, so you too may devote yourself to them and perhaps one day rival even my own knowledge (I highly doubt it).": "草药学不是简单地四处游荡和采摘漂亮的花朵! 草药学是一个全面的行业，有许多方面，人们可以用一生的时间来掌握。我把这些额外的方面介绍给你们，这样你们也可以全身心地投入其中，也许有一天可以与我的知识相媲美（我非常怀疑）。",
	"If you've reached this far in my book, no doubt you've become quite the herbalism master! But do not think you are the only one who has studied this art; in my travels I have met many that have studied the plants and flora of these worlds, and found those whose talents astound even I! You may even find these restless souls during your own travels. If you do, make sure to mention my name—they may give you a discount on some of their services.": "如果你在我的书中走到了这一步，毫无疑问，你已经成为了相当的草药学大师！但不要以为你是唯一一个研究这门艺术的人；在我的旅行中，我遇到了许多研究这些世界的植物和植物群的人，发现他们的才能甚至让我感到震惊！在我的书中，我看到了很多人在研究这些植物。但不要以为你是唯一研究这门艺术的人；在我的旅行中，我遇到了许多研究这些世界的植物和植物群的人，发现那些人的才能甚至令我震惊！你甚至可以在自己的旅行中找到这些不安分的灵魂。你甚至可以在你自己的旅行中找到这些不安分的灵魂。如果你找到了，一定要提到我的名字--他们可能会给你一些服务的折扣。",
	"The following are some NPCs that a DM can easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use theseNPCs as convenient ways for the party to provide herbalism related services whenever they are needed.": "下面是一些NPC，DM可以很容易地将其放入任何活动或设置中。请自由使用这些NPC，以便在需要时为党提供草药学相关的服务。",
	"Harry Holderhek": "Harry Holderhek",
	"Halfling-Dwarf": "半身人-矮人",
	"The Holderhek clan is large and expansive—even growing to include many couplings between dwarves and other races. Harry is one such product of these unions, half a halfling, and half a dwarf (specifically, my second cousin Harchibold Holderhek). Having grown in the forests of his mother's people, Harry has long been familiar with plant life, taking to the druidic arts and becoming one of the foremost experts on herbs. In fact, his knowledge on the subject was instrumental in the writing of this book.": "霍尔德赫克氏族规模庞大，范围广泛--甚至发展到包括许多矮人和其他种族的联姻。哈利就是这些结合的产物之一，他有一半是半身人，一半是矮人（特别是我的二表哥哈奇博尔德-霍德赫克）。哈里在他母亲的森林里长大，早就熟悉了植物的生活，走上了德鲁伊的道路，成为最重要的草药专家之一。事实上，他在这方面的知识对本书的写作起了很大作用。",
	"Harry spends most of his time these days wandering the planes, looking for more rare plants to catalogue and research. He funds his travels by selling some of the more powerful herbs he finds along the way. In fact, his spice pouch of holding seems to have a never-ending supply of useful plants for any occasion, and his upstanding Holderhek morals means he always parts with them for a reasonable price.": "哈利这些天大部分时间都在飞机上游荡，寻找更多的珍稀植物来编目和研究。他通过出售沿途发现的一些更强大的草药来资助他的旅行。事实上，他的香料袋里似乎有永远用不完的有用植物，可供任何场合使用，而他正直的霍尔德希克道德意味着他总是以合理的价格将它们分出去。",
	"Human (?)": "人类（？）",
	"Mona is an odd individual to be sure, but I do ask you give them a fair chance when you meet them, as they are the finest brewer of tinctures I have met in my travels. Through a technique that they refuse to share with me, they are capable of brewing a herb into a tincture in a single day, allowing them to work through vast amounts of herbs at an unheard of speed. You do need to supply all related materials and costs for a regular tincture, plus a premium charge of an extra 20% on top of that, but I would say the fee is well worth the time and convenience they can save you.": "可以肯定的是，莫娜是一个奇怪的人，但我确实要求你在遇到他们时给他们一个公平的机会，因为他们是我在旅行中遇到的最好的酊剂酿造者。通过一种他们拒绝与我分享的技术，他们能够在一天之内将一种草药酿成酊剂，使他们能够以闻所未闻的速度处理大量的草药。你确实需要提供所有相关材料和普通酊剂的成本，另外还要在此基础上额外收取20%的费用，但我要说，这笔费用非常值得他们为你节省时间和便利。",
	"Also, despite their pallid skin, stiff movements, and raspy voice, they will assure you that they are most definitely alive and NOT a sentient zombie. I highly advise you not to contest them on this point, lest you risk finding their spit mixed in with your tincture order.": "此外，尽管他们皮肤苍白，动作僵硬，声音沙哑，但他们会向你保证，他们绝对是活着的，而不是有生命的僵尸。我强烈建议你不要在这一点上与他们争论，以免你有可能发现他们的口水混在你订购的酊剂里。",
	"You have attained a mastery of distilling herbs into {@variantrule tinctures|HHbH}, halving the time and cost it takes for you to create one.": "你已经掌握了将草药蒸馏成{@variantrule tinctures|HHbH}的技术，使你创造一个草药的时间和成本减半。",
	"Your attunement to nature causes you to find more herbs wherever you go, almost as if nature itself is attempting to aid you. Whenever you gather a herb, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 20, you gain an extra copy of the herb you just gathered.": "你对自然的调和使你无论走到哪里都能找到更多的草药，几乎就像自然本身在试图帮助你一样。每当你采集一种草药时，掷一个（%0%）。20分时，你会获得一份你刚刚采集的草药的额外副本。",
	"For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed under the standard rules that characters are always aware of the identity of the herb they have gathered, including its name, value, and effect. However, if the DM wishes to add a bit more complexity and challenge, they may wish to force players to identify herbs as well.": "为了简单起见，在标准规则下，假定角色总是知道他们所采集的草药的身份，包括其名称、价值和效果。但是，如果管理员希望增加一些复杂性和挑战性，他们可能希望迫使玩家也能识别草药。",
	"Under this optional rule, whenever a character forages a herb, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Nature}) check in order to identify the herb they have just gathered. On a failure, a character is only aware that the herb is vaguely useful, but does not know its name, effects, or how to use it.": "在这个可选的规则下，每当一个角色采集草药时，他们必须成功进行{@dc 15}智慧({@skill Nature})检查，以便识别他们刚刚采集的草药。如果失败，角色只知道该草药有模糊的作用，但不知道它的名字、效果或如何使用它。",
	"A character that has opted to pick a herb is assumed to know which herb they have picked.": "一个选择采摘草药的角色被认为知道他们采摘的是哪种草药。",
	"For balance reasons, it is advised to maintain the rule that allows a character to only benefit from the effects of one herb at a time. However, if the DM wishes, they may allow the high-reward usage of multiple herbs, by including a high-risk drawback known as {@b herb toxicity}.": "为了平衡起见，我们建议保留允许一个角色一次只能从一种草药的效果中受益的规则。然而，如果管理员愿意，他们可以允许高回报地使用多种草药，办法是包括一个称为（%0%）的高风险缺点。",
	"Under this optional rule, whenever a creature is under the effects of one herb and attempts to use another on themselves, they must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 5 x the number of herbs they have attempted to use since their last long rest. On a success, they use the herb as normal. On a failure, their body rejects the overload of magical influences on themselves, causing the herb to be wasted, the beneficial effects of any herb currently affecting them to end immediately, and for the creature to become {@condition poisoned} for one hour.": "在这个可选的规则下，每当一个生物在一种草药的作用下，试图在自己身上使用另一种草药时，他们必须做一个宪法救赎，其DC等于10+5x他们在最后一次长休后试图使用的草药数量。如果成功，他们就能正常使用该草药。如果失败，他们的身体就会拒绝自己身上过量的魔法影响，导致草药被浪费，当前影响他们的任何草药的有益效果立即结束，并且该生物会在一小时内变得（%0%）。",
	"While herbs are certainly valuable in the powers they impart, a major hindrance to their usability is the lengthy preparations that some of them require. In these situations, it may be wise to brew that herb into a tincture. A tincture is the essence of an herb, distilled through various processes and designed to apply all the effects of a herb in a much faster time frame.": "虽然草药所赋予的力量肯定是有价值的，但其可用性的一个主要障碍是其中一些草药需要长时间的准备工作。在这种情况下，将草药酿成酊剂可能是明智之举。酊剂是一种草药的精华，通过各种工艺蒸馏而成，旨在以更快的速度发挥草药的所有功效。",
	"Using a tincture takes an action and results in all the effects specified in the herb's description. Like herbs, a character may only benefit from the effects of one tincture or herb at a time. Using a new tincture while still under the effects of another tincture or herb, causes the first's effect to end immediately.": "使用酊剂需要一个动作，并导致该草药描述中指定的所有效果。与草药一样，一个角色一次只能从一种酊剂或草药的效果中受益。在另一种酊剂或草药的作用下使用一种新的酊剂，会使第一种的效果立即结束。",
	"Creating a tincture is no easy feat, and requires intricate knowledge alchemy to perform successfully. In order to create a tincture, a character must possess proficiency in and have access to alchemy supplies. In addition, that character must expend an amount of money equal to double the base cost of the herb to buy ingredients and other materials. Creating a tincture requires one work week of labour to produce.": "制造酊剂不是一件容易的事，需要复杂的炼金术知识才能成功。为了制造一种酊剂，一个角色必须熟练掌握炼金术，并能获得炼金术用品。此外，该角色必须花费相当于该草药基本成本两倍的金钱来购买原料和其他材料。制造一种酊剂需要一个工作周的劳动。",
	"At the end of the process, the herb is destroyed and the character creates a tincture with the name '{@code tincture of [consumed herb]}'.": "在这个过程结束时，草药被销毁，人物创造出一种名为\"（%0%）\"的酊剂。",
	"When you cast this spell, you declare up to 4 willing creatures you can see within 30 feet to share a magical bond with you. For the duration of the spell, whenever you use a herb on yourself, that herb's effects are duplicated among all creatures that share a magical bond with you, so long as they are on the same plane of existence.": "当你施展这个法术时，你宣布30英尺范围内你能看到的最多4个自愿的生物与你共享一个神奇的纽带。在法术持续期间，每当你对自己使用一种草药时，该草药的效果会在所有与你共享魔法纽带的生物中复制，只要他们在同一个存在平面。",
	"When you cast this spell, you grow a hollow needle from your arm for the duration that can be used as a natural finesse weapon to make unarmed strikes that deal {@damage 1d4} + Dexterity modifier in damage.": "当你施展此法术时，你在持续时间内从手臂上长出一根空心针，可以作为天然的精巧武器，进行徒手打击，造成{@damage 1d4}+灵巧修饰的伤害。",
	"Strikes with this needle can also be used to quickly deliver a poison or herb that would normally take much longer to apply to a weapon. As a bonus action, you may use the needle to absorb a poison or herb that would normally be used to coat a weapon. If you do so, this needle acts as if it is coated in that poison or herb, with all the benefits that would entail.": "使用这种针的打击也可以用来快速传递毒药或草药，而这些毒药或草药通常要花很长时间才能涂抹在武器上。作为一个额外动作，你可以用这根针来吸收通常用于涂抹武器的毒药或草药。如果你这样做了，这根针就像涂上了毒药或草药一样，具有所有的好处。",
	"You magically extract and absorb the essence of a herb in your hand, allowing you to instantly use the herb regardless of how long it would normally take to use it. This spell can only be used on herbs that affect your own body.": "你神奇地提取并吸收你手中草药的精华，使你能够立即使用该草药，而不管通常需要多长时间来使用它。这个咒语只能用于影响你自己身体的草药。",
	"One of your choice": "您选择的一个",
	"A set of {@item Traveler's Clothes|PHB|traveller's clothes}, a {@item herbalism kit|PHB}, a piece of jewellery containing a dried flower, and a belt {@item pouch|phb} containing 10 gp.": "一套{@item Traveler's Clothes|PHB|traveller's clothes}，一个{@item herbalism kit|PHB}，一个装有干花的首饰，和一个装有10gp的皮带{@item pouch|phb}。",
	"As an experienced herbalist, you know the best spots to find ripe plants, and the best techniques to gather them without wasting any of the precious resources inside. Whenever you gather a herb that has charges, that herb always starts with the maximum number of charges possible.": "作为一个有经验的草药专家，你知道找到成熟植物的最佳地点，以及收集它们而不浪费里面任何宝贵资源的最佳技术。每当你采集一种有电荷的草药时，该草药总是以可能的最大电荷数开始。",
	"Since their livelihood relies on a flourishing wild, herbalists tend to have a reverence for nature and hold a respect for the natural cycle of life. While most do live among others as healers or alchemists, they spend the majority of their time outdoors and alone, which can often lead to some eccentric traits.": "由于他们的生计依赖于繁荣的野生环境，所以草药师往往对大自然怀有敬畏之心，对生命的自然循环抱有尊重。虽然大多数人确实作为治疗师或炼金术士生活在其他人中间，但他们大部分时间都是在户外独自生活，这往往会导致一些古怪的特征。",

	"An absolutely wondrous leaf found on bushes and hedges that have grown on top of hard metal deposits.

	"While most birch trees are actually renowned for how long and hot they burn, the ashfree birch lives up to its name by actually doing the exact opposite—it vanishes almost instantly once exposed to heat. This is due to the composition of its bark which contains tiny ice crystals inside each cell. When exposed to heat, these cells rupture and release the trapped ice within, thereby neutralising the flame but also making it look like the bark simply disappeared into a puff of steam. While this may seem useless, the bark is actually quite useful as an insulation material and is often found in arctic villages being used to manage campfires and other open flames.": "虽然大多数白桦树实际上以其燃烧时间长、温度高而闻名，但无灰白桦树名副其实，它的作用恰恰相反，一旦受热，它几乎立即消失。这是由于其树皮的成分，每个细胞内都含有微小的冰晶。当受热时，这些细胞破裂并释放出其中的冰，从而中和了火焰，但也使树皮看起来只是消失在一缕蒸汽中。虽然这看起来毫无用处，但树皮实际上是相当有用的绝缘材料，在北极的村庄里经常发现它被用来管理篝火和其他明火。",

	"Named for the goddess of cold, this plant is every bit as sharp and wicked as its namesake.

If the dehydrated vine is broken afterwards, the air pockets release a high pitched, debilitating screech that resembles a banshee's wail.": "这种淡蓝色的藤蔓生长在盐水高度集中的地区，通常被发现缠绕在红树上。虽然它们是相对平凡的植物，但它们确实有一个奇怪的特征，即一旦被采摘，就会迅速脱落所有的水分，变成干燥的、充满微小气囊的绳索。如果脱水后的藤蔓被折断，气囊就会释放出高亢、衰弱的尖叫声，类似于女妖的哀号。",

On a failure, they are prevented from moving across the line for an hour, after which they may make the saving throw again, ending this effect on a success. In addition, creatures of those types are incapable of teleporting into or out of an enclosed area created by a line from this herb. This herb is capable of drawing a line of up to 60 feet in length.": "当你移动时，这种草药可以在你身后的地面上拖动，形成一条神奇的线，能够抵御天人、妖怪、恶魔和亡灵类生物。如果任何这些生物试图在这条草药创造的线上移动，它们必须做一个{@dc 18}的智慧救赎动作。如果失败，它们会在一小时内被阻止越过这条线，之后它们可以再次进行蓄力投掷，如果成功则结束这一效果。此外，这些类型的生物无法传送进入或离开由这种草药的线所形成的封闭区域。这种草药能够画一条长达60英尺的线。",

Indeed, the resemblance is more than superficial, as the petals secrete a magical oil that can transform flesh into stone much like its namesake's gaze.

Unfortunately, no conclusive evidence has so far been found.": "一种开着紫灰色低垂花朵的植物，类似于玄武岩的舌头。事实上，这种相似不仅仅是表面上的，因为花瓣分泌出一种神奇的油，可以把肉体变成石头，就像它的名字的凝视一样。长期以来，人们一直在争论这是否只是一个巧合，或者说玄武岩是否通过与这种植物的长期共存而获得了其标志性能力。不幸的是，到目前为止还没有找到结论性的证据。",

	"A knobbly root found in the depths of caves, said to grow where basilisks leave their droppings. The internal ecosystem of the root itself leads to the cultivation of colonies of bacteria that when inadvertently consumed with the root, radically alters one's digestive system to be able to process hard minerals and rocks as if it were any other food.

	"This herb is not a specific variety of plant, but rather it refers to a phenomenon that occurs in the roots of trees when they burrow into the right areas of the ground. While it is common for roots to hang from the ceilings of some caves, it is a much rarer occurrence for them to become suffused with the magic of the earth, causing them to emit a pale, but rather pleasant light—something that will happen to you too if you rub this herb on yourself, as well as anyone you manage to touch. Those who have eaten the herb have described its effects as calming, as well as a source of amusement by using their light trails to draw rather...rude shapes and messages.": "这种草药不是一种特定的植物品种，而是指树木的根部在钻入地面的正确区域时出现的一种现象。虽然树根挂在一些洞穴的天花板上很常见，但它们被大地的魔力所充斥，导致它们发出淡淡的、但相当令人愉快的光，这种情况也会发生在你身上，如果你把这种草药抹在自己身上，以及你设法接触的任何人身上。那些吃过这种草药的人把它的效果描述为镇静，以及用它们的光迹画出相当......粗鲁的形状和信息，是一种娱乐的来源。",

	"Personally, I disagree with the hypothesis that it is magic that causes the transformation. I instead propose that it is caused by a breed of algae too small to be seen with the naked eye that bonds with the root for safe anchorage in exchange for providing nutrients. Unfortunately I am unable to test my theory, as the sample I intended on testing ended up being lost when I had to use it to fight off a rather naughty behir I had met down in that cave system (for more information on this fight, pick up a copy of 'Hamund's Humble Hypotheses, Volume VII').": "就个人而言，我不同意是魔法导致转变的假说。相反，我认为它是由一种小到肉眼无法看到的藻类引起的，这种藻类与根部结合，以换取安全的锚定，提供营养。不幸的是，我无法测试我的理论，因为我打算测试的样本在我不得不用它来击退我在那个洞穴系统中遇到的一个相当顽皮的behir时最终丢失了（关于这场战斗的更多信息，请拿起一本《哈蒙德的卑微假设，第七卷》）。",
	"A wonderfully droll flower thought to have been invented in the courts of the Feywild by a druid attempting to win a fey queen's favour (they were apparently successful). This rose grows a naturally waxy cuticle around its flower petals, and when the tips are set alight, this wax melts much like a candle's would. Altogether, this rose is essentially usable as an ordinary candle, but with the added benefit of both looking and smelling fantastic. Other varieties have been grown as well, leading to a range of colours and fragrances. They can be rather expensive for common folk however, so they are usually only brought out when celebrating a valued guest.": "这是一种奇妙的有趣的花，被认为是由德鲁伊在精灵世界的法庭上发明的，试图赢得精灵女王的青睐（他们显然是成功的）。这种玫瑰的花瓣周围长着一层天然的蜡质角质层，当花瓣顶端被点燃时，这种蜡会像蜡烛一样融化。总的来说，这种玫瑰基本上可以像普通的蜡烛一样使用，但有一个额外的好处，就是看起来和闻起来都很好。其他品种也被种植，导致了一系列的颜色和香味。然而，对于普通人来说，它们可能相当昂贵，所以它们通常只在庆祝贵客时才被拿出来。",
	"This foot-long herb may be used in the same manner as an ordinary {@item candle|PHB}: for 1 hour when lit, it sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

	"Despite its name, this herb is not actually a rose, nor does it even resemble one—apparently whoever discovered it just really wanted to make an allusion to the cartography term. This herb, which is actually a type of fern, is magically attuned to the wind which it uses as its main method of propagating spores. It is in fact so sensitive to changes in the wind, that it will react to even the weakest of breezes. This ability has been taken advantage of by spelunkers as a makeshift method of discovering surface passages even when in the most confusing cave systems.": "尽管它的名字叫玫瑰，但这种草药实际上并不是玫瑰，甚至也不像玫瑰--显然，发现它的人只是真的想影射一下制图学术语。这种草本植物实际上是一种蕨类植物，它神奇地与风相适应，并将其作为繁殖孢子的主要方法。事实上，它对风的变化非常敏感，甚至对最微弱的微风也有反应。这种能力已经被探险者利用，作为一种临时的方法，即使在最混乱的洞穴系统中也能发现表面通道。",

	"As can be gleaned from this herb's morbid name, corpse hands resemble a rotting hand rising from the swamp waters like it was raised in some poor soul's final act of desperation. In actuality, corpse hands are mangrove-like roots and are even more macabre than they look. They are actually a carnivorous plant that produces an oil on the \"palm\" of its hand.

	"An icy-blue fruit that well deserves its name. This curious fruit has an incredibly strange adaptation in that its juice freezes any creature that drinks it. Ostensibly, its purpose is to freeze any insects that attempt to eat it once it blooms at the start of the winter months. Once the snows thaw, the frozen insects are released and have free reign to spread the fruit's pollen far and wide, free from competition.

Indeed, the soft seeds of the pad and the oil of the stalk have been used by experienced soldiers to dampen the sound of their equipment when on raids or scouting expeditions.": "这是一种非常漂亮的芦苇，上面长着一个独特的垫子，上面覆盖着令人难以置信的柔软的、类似棉花的种子。这些垫子使本地文化相信，它们被路过的精灵们用作休息场所，而通过在那里居住，它们反过来又将其臭名昭著的隐藏和隐蔽的才能灌输到植物中。事实上，有经验的士兵在突袭或侦察时，用软垫的种子和茎的油来抑制装备的声音。",
	"You may spend 10 minutes applying this herb to yourself, stuffing its seeds into your armour and lubricating the joints with its oil. If you do so, you ignore any disadvantage to Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks that you may have while wearing your armor type.": "你可以花10分钟把这种草药涂在自己身上，把它的种子塞进你的盔甲，用它的油来润滑关节。如果你这样做，你可以忽略你在穿着你的盔甲类型时可能有的任何灵巧（（%0%））检查的劣势。",
	"A rather whimsical fruit that resembles a bunch of green bananas if each fruit was squashed to the thickness of a finger—with the result being something that resembles a thick fan. Although the fruit tastes and acts much like a regular banana when ripe, ones that have only recently fruited will have skins filled with gas designed to hasten the ripening of the flesh inside. If these are picked and then burst, the gas is released, creating a surprisingly powerful gust of wind. While this wind is by no means dangerous, it has been used as a source of entertainment by children playing pranks, as well as mild utility in specific circumstances.": "这是一种相当奇特的水果，如果把每个水果压扁到手指粗细，就像一串绿色的香蕉，其结果是类似于一把厚厚的扇子。虽然这种水果在成熟时的味道和行为与普通香蕉很相似，但最近才开花结果的水果，其外皮会充满气体，旨在加速内部果肉的成熟。如果这些香蕉被采摘后爆裂，气体就会被释放出来，产生一股令人惊讶的强大风力。虽然这种风绝无危险，但它已被儿童用作恶作剧的娱乐来源，以及在特定情况下的轻微效用。",
	"This herb has {@dice 1d6} charges, with each charge corresponding to one of the fruits of the herb. As an action, you may expend one or more charges to burst the fruits, releasing pent up gas inside and creating a burst of wind that is 5 feet wide and has a length equal to 5 times the number of charges expended. This wind is powerful enough to snuff out open flames and knock over small objects, but not enough to knock a creature {@condition prone}.": "这种草药有{@dice 1d6}的能量，每个能量对应一种草药的果实。作为一个动作，你可以消耗一个或多个炸药来炸开果实，释放里面压抑的气体，并产生一阵风，宽度为5英尺，长度等于消耗的炸药数量的5倍。这种风的威力足以扑灭明火和击倒小型物体，但不足以击倒一个生物（1%）。",
	"There are legends of a certain type of tree that all fey creatures fear—one cursed in the dying breath of a forsaken kin who wanted to inflict their last moments of spite on all the mercurial denizens of the Feywild. Regardless of the veracity of this legend, it is true that most fey creatures find the branches of the {@i incarcereta} tree particularly repugnant, as it has the remarkable ability to 'lock' a creature within space and cut them off from any magic that would attempt to shunt their body elsewhere. It is only natural that the fey, who consider teleportation their default mode of transport and who treat the barrier between planes as a formality at best, fear and despise this otherwise useful herb.": "有关于某种类型的树的传说，所有的费伊生物都害怕这种树--它是被遗弃的亲属临终前的诅咒，他们想把自己最后的怨恨施加在费伊世界所有多情的居民身上。不管这个传说的真实性如何，大多数费伊生物确实觉得{@i incarcereta}树的树枝特别令人厌恶，因为它有非凡的能力将一个生物 \"锁定 \"在空间内，并切断他们与任何试图将他们的身体分流到其他地方的魔法。费伊人认为传送是他们默认的运输方式，他们最多只是把平面之间的屏障当作一种形式，他们害怕和鄙视这种本来有用的草药，这是很自然的。",
	"You may use this herb as a weapon, treating it as a {@item dagger|PHB}. When you successfully hit a creature with this herb, you may choose to leave it embedded in their body, losing the herb in the process.

Unfortunately, I have been promptly shut down each and every time. I consider this to be one of the few true failures of my life.": "在一年一度的中医会议上，我一次又一次地提出了一个程序点，要求将这种草药改名为 \"利害关系人\"。不幸的是，每一次我都被迅速关闭。我认为这是我生命中为数不多的真正失败之一。",
	"An incredibly spicy variety of chilli pepper, identifiable by two distinctive nubs growing from its top resembling horns. Along with the usual bodily responses to spice, this herb also causes the eater's blood pressure and body temperature to rise, resulting in their skin taking on a bright red hue and their breath to become visible regardless of temperature. While some describe this as unpleasant, the chilli has been used by charlatans in order to trick naive villagers into thinking they are under assault by fiendish beings.": "一种极其辛辣的辣椒品种，从其顶部长出的两个独特的小疙瘩类似于角，可以识别。除了对香料的一般身体反应外，这种草药还能使食用者的血压和体温上升，导致他们的皮肤呈现出鲜红的颜色，无论温度如何，他们的呼吸都会变得明显。虽然有些人将此描述为令人不快，但辣椒已被骗子用来欺骗天真的村民，让他们以为自己正受到恶魔般的攻击。",

	"A particularly stunning variety of wisteria with a distinctive yellow streak on their petals that pulsates faintly with a calming glow. It is believed that these wisteria only grow in areas that were once the site of some holy event, such as a religious ritual or the death of a blessed figure.

	"Often mistaken for a school of fish resting on a seabed rock, fin moss is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: moss that is shaped like a fin. This shape grants it two somewhat useful physical properties—the first is that it adheres to things very well, the other is that it is extremely hydrodynamic. Due to these properties, they can actually be used as a natural weapon attachment, allowing them to function properly underwater (at the cost of looking a little bit silly).": "鳍状苔藓常常被误认为是在海底岩石上休息的鱼群，它几乎和它的名字一样：形状像鳍的苔藓。这种形状赋予它两个有点有用的物理特性--首先是它能很好地附着在事物上，其次是它具有极强的水动力。由于这些特性，它们实际上可以被用作天然的武器附件，使它们能够在水下正常工作（代价是看起来有点傻）。",

	"A stunning red and yellow flower that grows only under harsh sunlight. While most flowers would wilt under such an environment, the fire flower uses this to its advantage by growing oily seeds which burst forth when the plant inevitably combusts, propagating itself vast distances up to a mile away. However, when these seeds are collected early and then pressed into an oil and applied to a weapon, they impart the elemental power of fire to anything that weapon strikes.": "一种令人惊叹的红黄相间的花朵，只在恶劣的阳光下生长。虽然大多数花在这样的环境下会枯萎，但火花却利用这一点，在植物不可避免地燃烧时，生长出油性的种子，将自己传播到一英里以外的广大地区。然而，当这些种子被提前收集起来，然后压成油状并应用到武器上时，它们会将火的元素力量传给武器击中的任何东西。",

	"A beautiful orange-red plant herb that can be found by looking for the distinctive flame shaped stalks that it shoots above the soil. Unlike its more mundane cousin, it is highly recommended that you do not attempt to eat this plant, as it has developed a unique propagation method that causes its bulb to explode upon undergoing sufficient external stress (like that of a bite or simply a very hard landing) and thus spreading its seeds a long distance. However, if you really must know what the plant tastes like, I can confirm (with a very burnt tongue) that it tastes like a mix of cinnamon and cloves.": "这是一种美丽的橙红色植物药草，可以通过寻找它在土壤上方伸出的独特的火焰形茎干来找到。与它更平凡的表弟不同，强烈建议你不要尝试吃这种植物，因为它已经开发出一种独特的繁殖方法，使它的球茎在承受足够的外部压力（如咬伤或简单的硬着陆）时发生爆炸，从而将其种子传播到很远的地方。然而，如果你真的必须知道这种植物的味道，我可以确认（用非常烧焦的舌头），它的味道是肉桂和丁香的混合。",
	"As an action, you may throw this herb at a space within 20 feet of you that you can see.

	"Featuring two small bulbs growing from the top of its flat, wide cap, this mushroom resembles the creatures of its namesake.

	"A succulent related to the jade plant, easily identified by the golden tinge it has on each of its plump leaves. Exceedingly rare, this auspicious plant has been found in many culture's folktales, as either a lucky boon that saves the hero from danger, or as a reward from a trickster god for a job well done.

	"An innocuous looking plant growing in frozen fields that is often overlooked by anyone unaccustomed to arctic survival. This small, bulby, white plant contains a special resin that it uses to insulate its interior against harsh arctic winds and survive till summer.

	"Quite difficult to find due to its stony-grey complexion, the gargoyle's lichen is said to grow on the rubble of its namesake's corpse. While it is ultimately harmless, the lichen does contain a chemical that reacts with many creature's skin when rubbed on it, causing it to harden and turn grey like stone. Although it may look unpleasant to some, it has been used as part of religious ceremonies in some cultures to mimic certain creatures from ancient stories.": "由于其石灰色的肤色，巨妖的地衣相当难找，据说它生长在同名尸体的碎石上。虽然它最终是无害的，但地衣确实含有一种化学物质，当它被摩擦时，会与许多生物的皮肤发生反应，导致它变硬，像石头一样变成灰色。虽然它对一些人来说可能看起来很不愉快，但在一些文化中，它被用作宗教仪式的一部分，模仿古代故事中的某些生物。",

While most trees simply snap freeze as one would expect, on a rare occasion, certain branches will absorb this magic and become a glacier branch. While they are beautiful in and of themselves, it is their slushy-like sap that is the true wonder, as it contains a marvellous ability to instantly expand and solidify into solid ice once it has been exposed to air.

	"What is often mistaken for a mass of solid ground floating on the water is actually a mass of tiny, pyramid-shaped, weeds that glide across the ocean's surface like a moving island.

On a failure, all attacks made against that creature are made at advantage until the start of your next turn.": "作为一个行动，你可以用这种植物的树脂覆盖一件近战武器或最多10件弹药。在接下来的一小时内，当你使用该武器成功地击中一个龙型生物时，该生物必须做一个{@dc 15}体质救赎动作。如果失败，所有针对该生物的攻击都将以优势进行，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"A delicacy sought by nobles and wealthy merchants from across the world, the golden truffle is renowned for both its heady distinctive flavour as well as its purported medicinal properties. While it is possible to spend time and effort to find these buried treasures by oneself, enterprising farmers have learned how to train other creatures to sniff and seek them out.Reportedly, the best companion for the job is the ever-threatening {@creature owlbear|MM}, as their sharp sense of smell and unwillingness to eat the truffles themselves makes them perfect for the job—if you can train them not to try and eat you first.": "金松露是世界各地贵族和富商追捧的美食，因其令人陶醉的独特风味和据称的药用价值而闻名。虽然有可能花时间和精力去寻找这些埋藏在地下的宝藏，但有进取心的农民已经学会了如何训练其他生物去闻和寻找它们。据报道，这项工作的最佳伙伴是永远具有威胁性的（%0%），因为它们敏锐的嗅觉和不愿意吃松露本身使得它们非常适合这项工作--如果你能训练它们不要先尝试吃你的话。",
	"This herb contains {@dice 1d6} charges. You may expend one charge to use this herb, after which, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to double your character level, and you gain the same amount of hit points.

	"Found inside pods of a hardy bush, these seeds contain an oil that dries into a rubbery material shortly after being exposed to air. Its similarity to rubber actually extends to its insulation abilities, and the seed is sought-after as a natural protection against creatures that wield the deadly power of lightning.": "这些种子被发现在一种坚韧的灌木的豆荚里，含有一种油，在暴露在空气中后不久就会干燥成一种橡胶状物质。它与橡胶的相似性实际上延伸到了它的绝缘能力，而且这种种子作为一种天然的保护措施被人们所追捧，以抵御挥舞着致命的雷电力量的生物。",
	"You gain resistance to lightning damage for 4 hours after using this herb.": "使用此草药后，你在4小时内获得对雷电伤害的抵抗。",
	"A dry, grey root that grows only on dark sites of death and misery. While it may seem like these conditions would make for a wicked plant, the opposite actually holds true: they are in fact omens of good luck and wards against malicious forces that would attempt to disturb the dead upon which they grow. That should not stop you from picking some of them yourself however, as a powder made from these roots makes for a fine defence against necrotic magics.": "一种干燥、灰色的根，只生长在死亡和苦难的黑暗地点。虽然看起来这些条件会成为一种邪恶的植物，但实际上恰恰相反：它们实际上是好运的预兆，可以抵御那些试图干扰它们所生长的死地的恶意力量。然而，这并不妨碍你自己采摘一些，因为用这些根茎制成的粉末可以很好地抵御坏死的魔法。",
	"You gain resistance to necrotic damage for 4 hours after using this herb.": "使用此草药后，你在4小时内获得对坏死性伤害的抵抗。",
	"Although grave root is certainly useful, I caution against using it liberally; it possesses a certain musk that will make you smell like your grandparent's home for a week afterwards. Maybe it's better to just cop some necrotic corruption on the chin.": "虽然墓根肯定是有用的，但我提醒不要随意使用它；它拥有某种麝香，会让你在之后的一个星期里闻起来像你祖父母的家。也许最好只是在下巴上应付一些坏死的腐败。",
	"This long, wispy vine hangs from trees and grows grey, stringy leaves that resemble the hair of an elderly woman. In many societies built near where hag's hair is found, a common belief is that the plant is grown from actual hair left by hags in trees as a means of corrupting the forests and extending their influence. In actual fact, this vine grows on trees that are already blighted and works symbiotically with it to draw out parasites and other diseases which grants it several anti-microbial properties once boiled and drunk.": "这种长长的、飘忽不定的藤蔓挂在树上，长出灰色的、绞碎的叶子，类似于老年妇女的头发。在许多建在发现女巫头发的地方附近的社会中，人们普遍认为这种植物是由女巫留在树上的真正的头发长出来的，作为腐蚀森林和扩大其影响的一种手段。事实上，这种藤蔓生长在已经枯萎的树木上，并与之共生，吸引寄生虫和其他疾病，一旦煮熟喝下，就会赋予它一些抗微生物的特性。",
	"When you use this herb, you become immune to diseases for the next 24 hours and any disease effects that you are currently subjected to have their progression and symptoms halted.": "当你使用这种草药时，你会在接下来的24小时内对疾病产生免疫力，而且你目前受到的任何疾病影响都会停止其发展和症状。",
	"Yes, this is a herb discovered by none other than I, Hamund Holderhek! This thick grey moss resembles the facial hair of none other than yours truly, and is just as hard, steely, and useful as its namesake.This moss is in fact usually found near deposits of iron located in places of great magical power, such as planar portals, ritual sites, or ancient temples. While difficult to harvest, this moss is a versatile material that is more akin to lightweight, flexible steel than a simple plant.": "是的，这是由我哈蒙-霍尔德赫克发现的一种草药！这种厚厚的灰色苔藓就像你的脸一样坚硬，而且和它的名字一样有用。这种厚厚的灰色苔藓就像你的面部毛发一样，和它的名字一样坚硬、牢固、有用。事实上，这种苔藓通常是在有巨大魔力的地方的铁矿附近发现的，比如平面门户、仪式现场或古代寺庙。虽然很难收获，但这种苔藓是一种多功能的材料，与简单的植物相比，它更类似于轻质、灵活的钢铁。",
	"You may spend 3 hours applying this herb to armour which involves twisting and weaving the durable yet flexible strands into that armour's weakest areas. After this hour, the armour permanently imparts a +1 bonus to AC when worn. This herb cannot be applied to armour that already has a bonus to AC or to shields.": "你可以花3个小时将这种草药涂抹在盔甲上，包括将耐用而有弹性的纤维线缠绕在盔甲最薄弱的地方。在这一小时之后，该盔甲在穿戴时将永久地赋予+1的交流奖励。这种草药不能应用于已经有AC加成的盔甲或盾牌上。",
	"A cousin of chamomile that packs the same calming effect, but amplified to an absurd degree. Identified by its pale-grey colouration, tea made from the roots and stem of this plant cause a creature's central nervous system to stabilise at its most optimal conditions—and then prevent absolutely any deviation from these levels. The resulting fugue has been described as a dulling of one's feelings and an ultimate calm that is unaffected by any external stimuli. While this dampening effect may sound unpleasant to some, others appreciate the stability it provides.": "这是洋甘菊的一个表亲，具有同样的镇静效果，但被放大到一个荒谬的程度。用这种植物的根和茎制成的茶可以使生物的中枢神经系统稳定在最理想的状态，然后绝对防止偏离这些水平。由此产生的赋格被描述为人的感觉变迟钝，以及不受任何外部刺激影响的最终平静。虽然这种抑制作用对一些人来说可能听起来不愉快，但其他人却很欣赏它所提供的稳定性。",
	"After preparing this herb, you gain an intense calm for the next hour. During this time, you are unable to gain advantage or disadvantage on any roll.": "准备好这种草药后，你会在接下来的一小时内获得强烈的平静。在这段时间内，你无法在任何卷轴上获得优势或劣势。",
	"Although the plant is useful in tense combat situations, I have often imbibed it for personal use. Such times when an incredible calm has served me in the past include (but are not limited to): talking to my publisher, sitting through a mediocre play written by a friend, being forced to eat a meal with one of my critics, and being cornered in the washroom by one very overzealous fan (for more on that last anecdote, see Hamund's Hilarious Headaches, volume XIV).": "虽然这种植物在紧张的战斗情况下很有用，但我也经常把它浸泡在个人使用中。过去，这种令人难以置信的平静为我服务的时候包括（但不限于）：与我的出版商谈话，坐着看一个朋友写的平庸的剧本，被迫与我的一个批评家一起吃饭，以及被一个非常热心的粉丝逼到洗手间里（关于最后一个轶事，见《哈蒙的滑稽头痛》第十四卷）。",
	"An unquestionably magical herb found only on remote mountainsides, untouched by general society. With a checkered pattern resembling that of the fritallary but burnished with a radiant gold colour, this herb is believed to have been created directly by the gods as a method to test their faithful, and to push the boundaries of fate that even they are beholden to. Indeed, burning this herb and inhaling the resulting smoke results in a feeling of pure euphoria and otherworldly power that manifests as breaking through limits that would otherwise be impossible.": "这是一种毫无疑问的神奇草药，只在偏远的山坡上发现，未被一般社会所触及。这种草药的格子图案类似于Fritallary，但被烧成了金黄色，据说这种草药是由神直接创造的，作为测试他们的信徒的一种方法，并突破连他们都要遵守的命运的界限。事实上，燃烧这种草药并吸入所产生的烟雾，会产生一种纯粹的兴奋感和其他世界的力量，表现为突破极限，否则就不可能。",

	"Easily identified by their striking red exterior, these thumb-sized beans are filled with gases that heat up and then expand under the harsh desert sun. When this happens, the beans proceed to \"hop\", propelling them a short distance before cooling down and then doing it again soon after. It is believed that this is their main method of propagation as it allows them to be noticed by passing scavengers and then brought to more fertile areas. That said, if the gases within are inhaled, they cause a strange transformation in which the body is lightened, allowing one to leap long distances without any increase in leg strength.": "这些拇指大小的豆子很容易被其醒目的红色外表所识别，它们充满了气体，在严酷的沙漠阳光下加热，然后膨胀。当这种情况发生时，这些豆子开始 \"跳跃\"，在冷却之前将它们推进一小段距离，然后在不久之后再次跳动。人们认为这是它们的主要传播方式，因为这使它们能够被路过的清道夫注意到，然后被带到更肥沃的地区。也就是说，如果吸入其中的气体，它们会导致一种奇怪的转变，即身体变轻，允许一个人在不增加腿部力量的情况下跳跃很远的距离。",

	"Technically this is not a plant, but rather a portion of mud that has had the leaves of the {@i olfactaria sphagnum} moss decompose inside of it. The result is a special mud that completely blocks and neutralises any odours on one's body.

	"Being one of the most invasive species in the world, it is no wonder that mint has managed to find its way into even the most frigid of areas. That said, this mint boasts a magic touch to adapt to its cold environment, housing minor ice power inside that can be imparted to anyone that chews it for long enough.": "作为世界上最具侵略性的物种之一，难怪薄荷能够成功地进入最寒冷的地区。也就是说，这种薄荷拥有适应寒冷环境的魔力，它的内部有轻微的冰力，可以传授给任何咀嚼它足够长的时间。",
	"For 8 hours after using this herb, your breath is always visible, smells like a refreshing mint, and is cold enough to cause frost to build up on objects you exhale upon.": "使用这种草药后的8个小时内，你的呼吸总是可见的，闻起来像清爽的薄荷，而且冷到足以使你呼出的物体上结霜。",
	"It is rare to find vines in the arctic, as the arid environment doesn't lend itself to strong supports to climb, nor does the cold promote the watery and supple structure of a vine. The ice vine overcomes both of these challenges however, by growing itself along icy stalactites, as well as possessing the uncanny ability to be immune to outside temperatures. Its ability to remain cool regardless of the weather has led to it being used as a source of refrigeration, as well as for comfortable bedding in summer months.": "在北极地区很少能找到藤蔓，因为干旱的环境不适合强壮的支撑物来攀爬，寒冷也不适合藤蔓的水分和柔软的结构。然而，冰藤克服了这两个挑战，它沿着冰冷的钟乳石生长，并拥有对外界温度免疫的神奇能力。无论天气如何，它都能保持凉爽，这导致它被用作制冷的来源，以及在夏季用于舒适的床上用品。",

	"Petrified wood occurs when a fallen tree is buried in sediment, after which a process occurs that replaces the organic material with minerals. This can even occur in frozen environments wherein a tree becomes snap frozen in the cold and hardens over time. In some exceptional circumstances (such as when a tree fell over a leyline, or perhaps was touched by a dryad at some point), magic can seep into the fallen tree as it crystallises, thereby creating icestone trunks. This magical wood contains the harshest colds inside its frozen form, and when chunks of it are used as a sharpening stone, can cause a weapon to freeze its target in solid ice.": "当一棵倒下的树被埋在沉积物中时，就会出现石化的木头，之后发生一个用矿物质取代有机材料的过程。这甚至可以发生在冰冻的环境中，在这种情况下，树木在寒冷中被冻结，并随着时间的推移而变硬。在一些特殊的情况下（比如当一棵树倒在雷勒线上，或者也许在某个时候被干尸碰过），魔法可以在结晶时渗入倒下的树，从而形成冰石树干。这种神奇的木材在其冰冻的形式中含有最严酷的寒气，当它的大块被用作磨刀石时，可以使武器在坚冰中冻结其目标。",

	"In areas of permafrost, the icicles last so long that they become able to support the growth of plant life that feeds on microbes and algae trapped within. One such breed of plant is known as icicle moss and can be found by the steely-grey patches that it creates on the icicles it grows on.

	"This member of the cordyceps family is known for its pitch black coloration, long shape, and slimy skin. Like other cordyceps, this herb is parasitic in nature—in this case, it infects a victim's mind and induces a feeling of apathy and compliance.

	"A thick and hardy bush with leaves that display a distinctive metallic lustre. While most local legends around this plant would claim that the plant is touched by some sort of crafting or forging god that turned its leaves to metal, the truth is quite different, but (in my opinion) no less wondrous. What looks like a coating of iron is actually a symbiotic mould that grows only on this bush. This mould has an incredibly dense structure that protects the bush from sharp mountain winds and loose rocks that would threaten it—and in exchange, the mould feeds on the plant and uses it for photosynthesis. While it would be a shame to separate these partnered species, it is possible to gain the mould's protection by rubbing it on oneself and transferring the mould to one's skin. Of course, without the leaf, the mould will soon die, but even temporary protection by this plant should be considered a blessing.": "这是一种厚实而坚韧的灌木，叶子显示出独特的金属光泽。虽然当地围绕这种植物的大多数传说都声称，这种植物被某种手工艺或锻造之神触及，使其叶子变成了金属，但事实却截然不同，但（在我看来）其神奇之处同样不少。看起来像铁的涂层，实际上是一种只在这种灌木上生长的共生霉菌。这种霉菌有一个令人难以置信的密集结构，可以保护灌木免受尖锐的山风和松动的岩石的威胁--作为交换，霉菌以植物为食，并利用它进行光合作用。虽然将这些合作的物种分开是一种耻辱，但通过在自己身上擦拭，将霉菌转移到自己的皮肤上，就有可能获得霉菌的保护。当然，如果没有叶子，霉菌很快就会死亡，但即使是这种植物的临时保护也应该被视为一种祝福。",

It is often mistaken for a school of jellyfish, and for good reason other than its appearance, since its leaves are covered in a multitude of tiny hairs that are each loaded with a horribly caustic substance that causes painful burns when applied to exposed skin. When the herb is carefully handled and stored, these hairs remain active and can then be used as a coating on weaponry to add a stinging bite to one's strikes.": "一种半透明的海带，可以在海浪中漂浮或被冲到海滩上的大团中找到。它经常被误认为是一群水母，除了它的外观之外，还有一个很好的理由，因为它的叶子上覆盖着许多细小的毛发，每根毛发都含有一种可怕的腐蚀性物质，涂抹在暴露的皮肤上会引起疼痛的灼伤。当这种草药被小心地处理和储存时，这些毛发保持活性，然后可以被用作武器的涂层，为自己的攻击增加刺痛感。",

	"A herb with a hyperbolic name, the killer tomato is not actually dangerous—not physically at least. Said to have been created by a trickster god in a fit of mirthful cheekiness, this herb is able to sense whenever a bad joke, story, or song is performed around it, and then fly autonomously at the perpetrator to turn their face red with tomato juice.

	"A strain of gingko tree with leaves that shine as bright as gold and which always seems to have a holy radiance from within its branches. Archaeological findings have shown that these trees were once ubiquitous throughout the land.

	"The idea that the ki-rin vanish and hide these trees is absolute hogwash. The simple answer is that the leaves actually contain a mild intoxicating element that when ingested, leads to feelings of both euphoria (explaining the fantastical descriptions of them) as well as short term-memory loss. In other words, it's not that the trees are vanishing after imparting a miracle to the blessed few that find them—people are simply getting drunk on the leaves, wandering off, then forgetting where they found them.": "关于麒麟消失并隐藏这些树的想法绝对是胡说八道。简单的答案是，这些叶子实际上含有一种温和的醉人元素，摄入后会导致兴奋的感觉（解释了对它们的幻想性描述）以及短期记忆的丧失。换句话说，并不是说这些树在给找到它们的少数人带来奇迹之后就消失了--人们只是醉心于这些树叶，四处游荡，然后忘记了他们在哪里找到它们。",

However, should this shell ever be broken, the pressurised interior of the plant becomes highly unstable and explodes, violently forcing the stored water to gush in a tremendous burst.

Anytime to you are hit by a melee weapon attack, you may use your reaction to release a spray of sharp needles from the herbs on your body, forcing all creatures within 5 feet of you to make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 1d6} piercing damage on a failure, or half that on a success. Once you have used this ability 4 times, this herb runs out of needles and becomes useless.": "作为准备这种草药的一部分，你将这种草药的片段放在你衣服和盔甲周围的战略位置。当你被近战武器攻击时，你可以用你的反应从你身上的草药中释放出尖锐的针状物，迫使你周围5英尺内的所有生物做一个{@dc 14}灵巧的蓄力动作，失败时受到{@damage 1d6}穿刺伤害，成功时受到一半的伤害。一旦你使用这个能力4次，这种草药的针就会用完，变得无用。",
	"Scattered on the forest floor are walnut-sized seeds with a distinct purple hue. These are actually immature seeds of the {@i oleum carealus} tree. While the mature seeds are useful only as a nutritious snack, the prematurely shed ones contain a special oil that causes flames to turn blue and ghostly, as well as lose most of their smoke. While this results in a much more eerie flame, it also becomes much harder to detect from long distances and thus has been used by adventurers that need to travel clandestinely without losing the comfort of a warm campfire in their sleep.": "森林地面上散落着核桃大小的种子，具有明显的紫色色调。这些实际上是（%0%）树的未成熟种子。虽然成熟的种子只作为营养零食有用，但过早脱落的种子含有一种特殊的油，会使火焰变成蓝色和幽灵般的颜色，并失去大部分的烟雾。虽然这导致火焰更加阴森恐怖，但它也变得更难从远处发现，因此被那些需要秘密旅行而又不失温暖的篝火在睡梦中的舒适性的冒险者所使用。",
	"This seed may be thrown into a fire, causing it to turn a dim blue and mostly difficult to see at night without losing any output of heat, as well as preventing it from producing smoke. The flame only produces dim light in a 5-foot radius around it, and any creature attempting a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to find the flame does so at disadvantage.": "这颗种子可以被扔进火里，使它变成昏暗的蓝色，在夜间大多难以看到，而不会失去任何热量的输出，同时也防止它产生烟雾。火焰只在它周围5英尺的范围内产生昏暗的光线，任何试图用智慧（（%0%））检查来寻找火焰的生物都处于不利地位。",
	"I once had the sublime opportunity to witness the annual backburning of the Ghostwood forest—so named due to the abundance of nightflame seeds that litter its floor. Every year, the local people set fire to the forest to maintain its growth and promote healthy foliage, while simultaneously creating a spectacular and memorably eerie sight as almost-invisible blue flames devour the wood around them. If you can find the opportunity, I highly recommend taking the time to see it for yourself.": "我曾经有机会目睹了鬼木森林一年一度的反烧活动--因其地面上有大量的夜焰种子而得名。每年，当地人都会在森林里放火，以保持森林的生长，促进健康的树叶，同时创造一个壮观和令人难忘的阴森景象，因为几乎看不见的蓝色火焰吞噬了他们周围的木材。如果你能找到机会，我强烈建议你花时间亲自去看看。",
	"After a snowstorm, all that can be seen is a blanket of white—except for the patches of bright green that indicate the presence of the nofall bush and its fuzzy leaves. This herb secretes a hydrophobic oil across its leaves, ostensibly as a method of removing any snow that may prevent it from performing much needed photosynthesis. When this oil is rubbed on the soles of one's shoes, it changes the surface tension of the snow wherever it touches, causing it to be able to support a surprising amount of weight in unexpected distributions.": "暴风雪过后，能看到的只是一片白茫茫的一片--除了表明落叶灌木及其毛茸茸的叶子存在的那几片亮绿色。这种草本植物在其叶子上分泌一种疏水油，表面上看是为了清除可能妨碍其进行急需的光合作用的任何雪。当这种油被擦在一个人的鞋底时，它改变了它所接触到的雪的表面张力，使它能够在意想不到的分布中支持惊人的重量。",
	"As part of using this herb, you must rub it on the soles of your shoes, or your feet if you walk barefoot. For 8 hours after using this herb, you do not sink into deep snow.": "作为使用这种草药的一部分，你必须把它擦在鞋底，如果你赤脚走路，则擦在脚上。使用这种草药后的8小时内，不要沉入深雪中。",
	"These pinky nail-sized seeds are recognisable by their waxy brown exterior and distinctive drop shape. When swallowed whole, they release a mouthful of fresh juice that actually provides all the hydration that the average humanoid needs in a day. While botanists have yet to figure out where these plants come from, the reigning theory is that they are the result of magical incursions and weaknesses between planes that result in certain places temporarily touching the Elemental Plane of Water. These seeds then spawn close to the surface of the sand, ready to be picked by whatever wandering creature is lucky enough to forage them. They are so prevalent and useful, that some desert cultures have taken to using them as currency in place of gold.": "这些小指甲大小的种子可通过其蜡质棕色的外表和独特的水滴形状来识别。当整个吞下时，它们会释放出一口新鲜的果汁，实际上提供了普通人一天所需的所有水分。虽然植物学家还没有弄清楚这些植物来自哪里，但主流理论认为它们是魔法入侵的结果，也是星球之间的弱点，导致某些地方暂时接触到水元素星球。这些种子在沙子表面附近产卵，准备被任何幸运的流浪生物采摘。它们是如此普遍和有用，以至于一些沙漠文化已经把它们当作货币来使用，以取代黄金。",
	"When you apply this herb, you are considered to have drunk a day's worth of fresh water.": "当你应用这种草药时，你被认为是喝了一天的淡水。",
	"An ubiquitous bush long sought by creatures of all kinds due to its anaesthetic properties. Unfortunately, its numbing effects do result in a loss of coordination—something that trappers have taken advantage of by turning the leaves into bait that makes their quarry easier to hunt.": "这是一种无处不在的灌木，由于其麻醉特性，长期以来被各种生物所追捧。不幸的是，它的麻木效果确实会导致协调能力的丧失--捕猎者利用了这一点，将叶子变成诱饵，使他们的猎物更容易被猎杀。",

For the next hour, you gain 8 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns, but have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity ability checks.": "作为一个动作，你可以将这种草药涂抹在你的身体和伤口上，从而使用它。在接下来的一个小时里，你在每个回合开始时都会获得8个临时命中率，但在灵巧救赎和灵巧能力检查方面有劣势。",
	"A particularly bright red begonia that rises somewhat beautifully out of fetid swamp mud. However, its beauty belies its insidious nature, as a side effect of combatting its toxic environment causes it to build up a chemical with an incredibly sharp, acetone smell. This chemical is so powerful in fact, that it will temporarily shut off the olfactory senses of anyone who crushes this herb and receives a whiff of the miasma inside. This side effect has been used by some people with unpleasant jobs to avoid the nastier environments they work in, such as sewers, plague hospitals, and tanning houses.": "一种特别鲜艳的红色海棠，从腥臭的沼泽泥浆中升起，显得有些漂亮。然而，它的美丽掩盖了它阴险的本质，因为对抗有毒环境的副作用导致它积累了一种化学物质，具有令人难以置信的尖锐的丙酮气味。事实上，这种化学物质是如此强大，以至于它将暂时关闭任何粉碎这种草药并闻到里面瘴气的人的嗅觉。一些从事不愉快工作的人利用这种副作用来避开他们工作的恶劣环境，如下水道、瘟疫医院和晒衣房。",
	"For 4 hours after using this herb, you have no sense of smell.": "使用这种草药后的4小时内，你没有嗅觉。",
	"If one reaches the peaks of the highest mountains, you may find oracles dwelling in caves shrouded in incense. While they were usually thought to have been ordained by the gods to communicate their prophecies, it's actually more likely that it is their incense that is responsible for their fortune-telling abilities. The oracle leaf is a magical plant that grows on shrubs on mountainsides, and it has been seen that inhaling their sweet smoke actually provides powers of minor clairvoyance and heightened awareness.": "如果到达最高的山峰，你可能会发现居住在笼罩在香火中的山洞里的神谕。虽然他们通常被认为是由神明授意来传达他们的预言，但实际上更有可能的是，是他们的香火成就了他们的算命能力。甲骨文叶是一种神奇的植物，生长在山坡上的灌木上，人们看到吸入它们的甜烟实际上提供了轻微的千里眼和高度意识的能力。",

	"A bright flower that comes in a wide variety of red, blue, yellow, and green shades, much like its namesake animal. Regardless of its actual colour, the stem boasts a number of hollow seed pods that when shaken or blown in the wind, produces a perfect mimicry of a certain sound usually found on a coast. How these seed pods manage to find these sounds is unknown, but it is widely believed that they are used to attract animals and other pollinators to themselves.": "这是一种明亮的花，有各种各样的红色、蓝色、黄色和绿色色调，很像它的同名动物。不管它的实际颜色如何，它的茎部拥有一些空心的种子荚，当摇动或在风中吹动时，会产生一种完美的模仿通常在海岸上发现的某种声音。这些豆荚是如何找到这些声音的，我们不得而知，但人们普遍认为，它们是用来吸引动物和其他授粉者到自己身边。",

	"A magical variety of pear identified by its extremely pale yellow colour that borders on a creamy white. Aside from being absolutely delicious, the juice of this herb can be boiled down into a thick, edible paste when placed into a crucible.

Either way, the sensation is described as quite pleasant.": "一种神奇的梨子品种，其颜色极淡，接近乳白色。除了绝对的美味之外，这种草药的汁液放入坩埚后可以熬成厚厚的可食用糊状物。这种糊状物在当地人中有很强的宗教历史，许多人声称它能让他们看到未来，而其他人则声称它只是一种致幻作用。无论是哪种方式，这种感觉都被描述为相当愉快。",

	"This algae takes the ominous form of small red clumps that resemble splotches of blood when they gather on the surface of the ocean. Due to this, they have entered one of the many tall tales told by sailors who believe that these \"blood splotches\" are omens of past seamen that died a violent death and will curse any voyage that comes near. Funnily enough, this legend actually has some merit as this algae actually does grow from blood spilled in the water, but it is usually from feeding shark frenzies rather than anything phantasmic. Incidentally, its bloody base works as a circulatory cleanser and can act as a prophylactic against poisons and other toxins.": "这种藻类以不祥的形式出现，当它们聚集在海面上时，就像血迹斑斑的小红块。由于这一点，它们已经成为水手们所讲的许多高大的故事之一，他们相信这些 \"血斑 \"是过去的海员暴死的预兆，并将诅咒任何接近的航行。有趣的是，这个传说实际上有一定的道理，因为这种藻类实际上确实是从水中溢出的血液中生长出来的，但这通常是来自于鲨鱼的狂欢，而不是什么幻觉。顺便说一句，它的血色基质可作为循环系统的清洁剂，并可作为预防毒药和其他毒素的措施。",

While the taste is unpleasant, it has a rather terrifying, but ultimately harmless side effect of rapidly increasing the regeneration rate of one's skin.

	"As part of using this herb, you tuck segments of this herb into specific segments of your clothes and armour. Whenever you are successfully hit by a melee weapon attack, you release a burst of spores in a 5-foot radius around you.

Once you have released 4 bursts of spores, the fungi segments in your clothes and armour becomes empty and this effect ends.": "作为使用这种草药的一部分，你将这种草药的片段塞进你衣服和盔甲的特定部分。每当你被一个近战武器攻击成功击中时，你会在你周围5英尺的范围内释放一阵孢子。除你之外的任何生物都必须做一个{@dc 15}的体质判定，如果失败，将变成{@condition poisoned}，持续1分钟。一旦你释放了4阵孢子，你衣服和盔甲中的真菌段就会变空，这个效果就会结束。",
	"Squirtwort is a series of bud-like plants connected by a stringy stem. Although it grows beneath the sands of a beach, they can be found easily by looking for the telltale jets of water that they squirt a few inches above the surface whenever the tide washes over them. This herb is quite ubiquitous, and during low tide, it is mesmerising to see the coast erupt with miniature geysers, almost as if the beach itself is breathing. Incidentally, the internal mechanism they use to squirt the water out also mixes it with an oily discharge that has been harvested by coastal cultures as both a lubricant, and mild intoxicant.": "鼠尾草是一系列芽状的植物，由一根细长的茎连接。虽然它生长在海滩的沙子下面，但只要寻找它们在潮水冲刷下喷出的几英寸高的水柱，就可以轻易找到它们。这种草本植物无处不在，在退潮时，看到海岸上喷出的微型喷泉令人着迷，几乎就像海滩本身在呼吸一样。顺便说一句，它们用来喷出水的内部机制也与一种油性分泌物混合在一起，这种油性分泌物已被沿海文化作为润滑剂和温和的麻醉剂采收。",
	"This herb contains {@dice 1d8} buds. As an action, you may throw one of these buds at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, bursting the bud upon contact.

	"The mighty steelwood sequoia are some of the oldest trees in the world—and for good reason. Their bark is virtually impenetrable and as hard as the alloy of its namesake. It owes this property to its incredible sap which drips down across its trunk over the tree's lifetime, and hardens into an invincible, yet flexible, veneer. If you manage to find an open vein of fresh sap, be sure to collect some as the protective coating it provides can make you as strong and long-lived as this majestic tree.": "强大的钢木红豆杉是世界上最古老的一些树木，而且有充分的理由。它们的树皮几乎是无法穿透的，而且像其名字的合金一样坚硬。它的这种特性归功于其令人难以置信的树液，在树的一生中，树液从树干上滴下来，并硬化成一个无敌的，但有弹性的单板。如果你设法找到一个开放的新鲜树液静脉，一定要收集一些，因为它提供的保护层可以使你像这种雄伟的树木一样强壮和长寿。",

Described as a mix between fresh dung and rotting meat, this horrid variety of daisy relies on its stench to attract flies and other insects as a means of spreading its pollen. It is unknown what brave or foolhardy soul first discovered this, but consuming this herb, will cause you to emit the same kind of odour as the herb, thankfully only for a short time.": "他们说，玫瑰的任何其他名字都会闻起来很甜--同样，恶臭花也会闻起来很可怕。这种可怕的雏菊被描述为新鲜粪便和腐肉的混合体，依靠其臭味来吸引苍蝇和其他昆虫，作为传播花粉的手段。不知道是哪个勇敢或愚蠢的人首先发现了这一点，但食用这种草药，会使你发出和这种草药一样的气味，幸好只持续很短一段时间。",
	"As an action, you may consume this herb, causing you to emit a debilitating odour for the next 10 minutes. During this time, any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you and that can smell, must make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw.

	"A strain of fig identifiable by the way it glistens like a diamond in the desert sun, the shiny veneer of this fruit is actually a hardened, sticky mucus that it produces as a method to reduce water-loss. While it is edible, the fruit is quite unpleasant, due to its interior texture that can be best described as a spider-web covered in snot. Beyond that, the fruit also has an odd effect on creatures that imbibe it, causing them to excrete the same mucus from their lower extremities, giving them a surer grip in treacherous environments.": "无花果的一种品系，在沙漠的阳光下像钻石一样闪闪发光，这种果实的闪亮表面实际上是一种硬化的、粘稠的粘液，是它产生的一种减少水分流失的方法。虽然它可以食用，但由于其内部质地可以被描述为覆盖着鼻涕的蜘蛛网，所以这种果实相当难吃。除此之外，这种果实对吸食它的生物也有一种奇怪的影响，使它们从下肢排泄出同样的粘液，使它们在险恶的环境中更容易抓牢。",
	"As an action, you may eat this herb. For the next hour, you produce a sticky mucus that adheres you to the surface you stand on, giving you advantage on any saving throw or ability check to avoid being moved against your will, as well as giving you a climb speed equal to your walk speed.": "作为一个行动，你可以吃这种草药。在接下来的一个小时里，你会产生一种粘稠的粘液，将你粘在你所站立的表面上，使你在任何蓄力或能力检查中获得优势，以避免违背你的意愿被移动，并使你的攀爬速度与你的步行速度相等。",
	"These hardy grey mushrooms have the curious property of absorbing the minerals of the rocky terrain in which they grow. The result is an extremely tough shell on their cap that helps prevent them from being eaten by wandering animal foragers. However, with a proper boiling technique, these shells can be broken down and become edible, lending their durability to the imbiber (just don't plan on having a pleasant experience on the toilet the next day).": "这些坚韧的灰色蘑菇有一个奇怪的特性，即吸收它们生长的岩石地带的矿物质。其结果是在它们的帽子上有一个极其坚硬的外壳，有助于防止它们被流浪的动物觅食者吃掉。然而，通过适当的煮沸技术，这些外壳可以被分解并成为可食用的，把它们的耐久性借给食用者（只是不要打算第二天在厕所里有愉快的经历）。",
	"For 8 hours after you use this herb, any critical hits made against you are turned into normal hits and any extra effects that would be triggered by that critical hit are negated.": "在你使用此草药后的8小时内，任何对你造成的关键打击都会变成普通打击，任何由该关键打击引发的额外效果都会被否定。",
	"There are some green adventurers that tell tales of times when they discovered a cave filled with phosphorescent mushrooms and the ghostly beauty they inspire; such stories are nothing when compared to the dazzling radiance of the sungi. A subterranean mushroom that contains a magical light rivalling that of the sun, this incredibly bright fungus is almost like an oasis in the suffocating darkness of a deep cave. The luminescence of the sungi is so bright, that clusters of them are capable of creating miniature ecosystems by themselves, surrounded by insects that resemble those on the surface, rather than specimens normally found in subterranean systems.": "有一些绿色冒险家讲述了他们发现了一个充满磷光蘑菇的洞穴，以及它们所激发的鬼魅之美；与太阳菌的耀眼光芒相比，这样的故事不算什么。这种地下蘑菇含有可与太阳相媲美的神奇光芒，这种令人难以置信的明亮的真菌几乎就像深洞中令人窒息的黑暗中的一片绿洲。太阳菌的发光是如此明亮，以至于它们的集群能够自己创造出微型的生态系统，周围的昆虫类似于地表上的昆虫，而不是通常在地下系统中发现的标本。",

	"An ubiquitous, blood-red moss that is found growing on the shaded sides of trees.

	"While most berries of the chromat oak area dull black colour (and unbearably tart at that), when grown under optimal conditions, they may occasionally produce a single berry that shines in every colour of the rainbow. This berry is highly prized as its juice is a potent dye ingredient—capable of colouring an entire article of clothing despite being only the size of a grape. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine exactly which colour this prismatic fruit will impart until after the dye has set into the fabric, but some people enjoy the random chance and consider it to be a minor spectacle.": "虽然大多数铬橡树地区的浆果颜色暗淡无光（而且酸得令人难以忍受），但如果在最佳条件下生长，它们偶尔会产生一种单一的浆果，闪耀着彩虹的每一种颜色。这种浆果非常珍贵，因为它的汁液是一种有效的染料成分--尽管只有葡萄那么大，却能给整件衣服上色。遗憾的是，在染料进入织物后，才可能确定这种棱镜果实会呈现出哪种颜色，但有些人喜欢这种随机的机会，认为这是一个小小的奇观。",

	"In their flower stage, these buds have large purple, star-shaped petals and are some of the first to bloom during the thawing months. This is in large part due to an adaptation during their budding stage, in which they secrete a saline solution that causes the snow around it to melt quickly, freeing the trapped bud to warmer sun and giving it the early energy push it needs to grow. However, for a variety of reasons, some clumps never end up flowering and remain in their bud form. While unfortunate to the flower, it is useful for foragers that need a way to cut through thick snow or ice in a hurry.": "在花期，这些花蕾有大的紫色星形花瓣，是解冻期最早开花的一些花。这在很大程度上是由于它们在发芽阶段的一种适应性，即它们分泌一种盐水，使周围的雪迅速融化，将被困的花蕾释放到更温暖的阳光下，给它提供生长所需的早期能量推动。然而，由于各种原因，一些花丛最终没有开花，仍然保持着花蕾的形态。虽然对花来说是不幸的，但对于需要在短时间内切开厚厚的雪或冰的觅食者来说，它是有用的。",

As its blood rises to the surface, it waters patches of soil which in turn sprout a magical, glowing blue grass that contains a portion of the titan's power. What is even more amazing is that this myth is not far off from the truth. In fact, what these cultures thought was grass is actually a sprouting mycelium network, and the buried titan is a massive fungus that spreads underground across continental distances.

Cave dwellers have long discovered the medicinal use of this plant, as it can be easily applied to the skin like a patch, whereupon it takes root and transfers the energy it pulls from the shadows into vitality for the creature that wears it.": "由于显而易见的原因，要在黑暗的洞穴深处找到植物是非常困难的。然而，有一种植物不仅能够在没有阳光的环境中生存，而且实际上能够在那里茁壮成长。伞形花舌是一种肝吸虫的品种，可通过其散落在地面上的一丛丛黑叶来识别。大多数植物需要阳光进行光合作用，而这种草药实际上恰恰相反，它自己消耗黑暗，作为一种副作用，它的叶子边缘会产生可怕的紫色光芒。洞穴居民很早就发现了这种植物的药用价值，因为它可以像药贴一样轻易地贴在皮肤上，然后生根发芽，将它从阴影中汲取的能量转化为佩戴它的生物的活力。",
	"For 8 hours after using this herb, you gain 6 temporary hit points whenever you start your turn in darkness.": "在使用此草药后的8小时内，每当你在黑暗中开始你的回合时，你会获得6个临时命中率。",
	"A pernicious and spiky herb found buried into cliffsides and unassuming hiking spots. In order to compensate for poor soil quality, this herb uses its hollow thorns as needles that drain the blood of any hapless creatures that stumble upon them.": "一种有害的带刺草本植物，被发现埋在悬崖边和不起眼的徒步旅行地点。为了弥补贫瘠的土壤质量，这种草本植物用它的空心刺作为针头，吸干任何绊倒它们的不幸生物的血液。",
	"This herb has {@dice 1d8} charges. As an action, you may wrap the roots of this herb around your arm while leaving its spiky flower held in a free hand. So long a sthis herb is wrapped around your arm, whenever a creature that has blood in its body dies within 5 feet of you, you may expend a charge in order to use your reaction to drain that creature's blood, granting you temporary hit points equal to their challenge rating (minimum of 1).": "这种草药有{@dice 1d8}的收费。作为一个动作，你可以将这种草药的根部缠绕在你的手臂上，同时将它的尖头花留在一只自由的手中。只要这种草药缠绕在你的手臂上，每当一个体内有血的生物在你5英尺范围内死亡，你可以消耗一个电荷，以便用你的反应来吸干那个生物的血，给予你相当于其挑战等级的临时命中率（最低为1）。",
	"Despite the name and appearance, this plant is not actually a tree, but is actually an extremely large and leafy variety of cactus. Rather than solid wood like a real tree, the trunk is actually formed from thousands of thin needles that weave together into a sturdy structure and allow it to disperse heat in the harsh desert sun. Clothes, hats, and roof thatching made from these hardy plants are extremely common and useful when in the desert (even though they are admittedly a little scratchy).": "尽管名字和外观如此，这种植物实际上并不是一棵树，而实际上是一种极其巨大且多叶的仙人掌品种。它的树干并不像真正的树那样是实木，而是由成千上万根细针形成的，这些细针交织成一个坚固的结构，使它能够在严酷的沙漠阳光下散发出热量。用这些坚韧的植物制成的衣服、帽子和屋顶茅草在沙漠中极为常见和有用（尽管不得不承认它们有点搔痒）。",
	"You may spend 10 minutes weaving the fibres of this plant into protective clothing for you to wear. While wearing it, you have advantage on any Constitution saving throws made to resist the adverse effects of hot weather.": "你可以花10分钟将这种植物的纤维织成防护服供你穿着。在穿着它的时候，你在为抵御炎热天气的不利影响而进行的任何宪法储蓄投掷中具有优势。",
	"I would like to state emphatically for the record that it was I, not Volo, who was the first to discover this plant (nor did I misidentify it as a tree). I actually came across this tree several months before he did, but alas, on my return trip to the herbologist society to record my discovery, I was waylaid by a lost princess that required my aid in returning to her kingdom. While I did manage to rescue the desperate royal, I found to my dismay that Volo had beaten me back home and taken all of my credit—something that I keep as one of the few regrets of my career (for more information on the story of the lost princess, pick up a copy of 'Hamund's Harrowing Histories, vol XIV').": "我想郑重声明，第一个发现这种植物的人是我，而不是沃罗（我也没有把它误认为是一种树）。实际上，我比他早几个月就发现了这棵树，但可惜的是，在我返回植物学家协会记录我的发现时，我被一位迷路的公主挡住了去路，她需要我的帮助才能回到她的王国。虽然我设法救出了这位绝望的王室成员，但我沮丧地发现，沃罗把我打回了家，并拿走了我所有的功劳--这是我职业生涯中为数不多的遗憾之一（关于这位失落公主的故事，请拿起一本《哈蒙德的痛苦历史，第十四卷》的副本）。",
	"From a distance, the fluffy, white heads of the whisper puff may make them seem like cotton. However, upon closer inspection, one can find a faint glow of magic radiating from each fibre, giving it the appearance of a small halo. The magic inherent in the whisper puff gives it a strange property that allows it to channel the flow of magic, but only when in close proximity to the source. Functionally, this has led to mages to stuff wads of this plant's fibres into their mouths in order to cast verbal-based spells without having to actually speak in anything but an inaudible whisper, an ability perfectly suited for secret sorcery. Incidentally, this usage is the origin of the term \"fluff-tongue\" to describe a mage that has been deemed untrustworthy.": "从远处看，耳语泡芙蓬松的白色头部可能使它们看起来像棉花。然而，仔细观察，可以发现每根纤维都散发着微弱的魔法光芒，使其看起来像一个小光环。耳语粉扑中固有的魔力赋予它一种奇怪的属性，使它能够引导魔力的流动，但只有在接近源头时才会如此。在功能上，这导致法师们将这种植物的纤维团塞进他们的嘴里，以便施展基于语言的法术，而不必真正用听不见的低语说话，这种能力非常适合秘密巫术。顺便说一下，这种用法是 \"绒毛舌 \"一词的起源，用来描述被认为不可信任的法师。",
	"This herb has {@dice 1d8} charges. As a bonus action, you may use a charge to stuff one of the bulbs of this herb in your mouth. If you do so, you make no audible noise the next time you {@action cast a spell} that has a verbal component.": "这种草药有{@dice 1d8}电荷。作为一个额外的动作，你可以使用一个电荷将这种草药的一个球茎塞进你的嘴里。如果你这样做了，你在下一次有语言成分的{@action cast a spell}时，就不会发出可闻的声音。",
	"Adventurers say that while deserts have oases, snowfields have winterlight bloom. This majestic plant features a powder blue flower that resembles a lotus. Each petal is thick and contains a salt compound that when added to water (such as snow), causes a chemical reaction that creates a very pleasant and long lasting source of heat. This adaptation allows the winterlight bloom to both process saltier environments and to also clear away snow from its surroundings so that its seeds can reach the soil when they drop.": "冒险家们说，虽然沙漠有绿洲，但雪原有冬日光辉的绽放。这种雄伟的植物以粉蓝色的花朵为特征，类似于荷花。每片花瓣都很厚，含有一种盐化合物，当加入水（如雪）时，会引起化学反应，产生一种非常令人愉快和持久的热源。这种适应性使冬青花既能处理较咸的环境，也能清除周围的积雪，使其种子在掉落时能到达土壤。",
	"You gain resistance to cold damage for 4 hours after using this herb.": "使用此草药后，你获得对寒冷伤害的抵抗力，持续4小时。",
	"A delightfully eye-catching tulip with a violet hue, this flower can be crushed into a beautiful, memorable ink. Because of its high quality, many wizards enjoy inscribing their spellbooks with this ink and it is common in many cultures to gift a bouquet of these flowers to young mages upon the completion of their studies.": "郁金香的紫罗兰色泽令人赏心悦目，这种花可以碾压成美丽而令人难忘的墨水。由于它的质量很高，许多巫师喜欢用这种墨水在他们的法术书上刻字，而且在许多文化中，在年轻法师完成学业后赠送一束这种花是很常见的。",
	"Over the course of an hour, this herb may be crushed and mixed in order to create a deep purple ink that can be used to inscribe spells into a wizard's spellbook. When used in this way, the ink replaces the gold piece requirements of the inscription. One herb is capable of creating enough ink to replace up to 100 gold pieces worth of spell inscription components.": "在一个小时的时间里，这种草药可以被粉碎和混合，以创造出一种深紫色的墨水，可以用来在巫师的法术书上刻下咒语。以这种方式使用时，墨水会取代铭文所需的金块。一种草药能够制造出足够的墨水来替代价值100个金币的法术铭文组件。",
	"While many chillis can cause a shortness of breath, the yell pepper actually has the opposite effect: increasing lung capacity and aiding breath control. As many have found (most likely including whoever named this herb), this results in the rather droll ability to dramatically increase the volume of one's voice. That said, the next sounds the eater is most likely to make are pained screams, since this herb is also known for being incredibly spicy.": "虽然许多寒带植物会导致呼吸急促，但大呼小叫的胡椒实际上有相反的效果：增加肺活量并帮助控制呼吸。正如许多人发现的那样（很可能包括为这种草药命名的人），这导致了相当滑稽的能力，即大幅提高人的声音音量。也就是说，吃的人最有可能发出的下一个声音是痛苦的尖叫，因为这种草药也以极其辛辣而闻名。",
	"You may eat this herb as an action. For the next hour, the maximum volume of your voice increases, causing you to be able to shout as loud as a thunderclap.": "你可以把这种草药当做一个动作来吃。在接下来的一个小时里，你的声音的最大音量会增加，使你能够像雷鸣般地大声喊叫。",
	"I have personally written countless letters to the Royal Botanist Society in a desperate campaign to change the official name of this herb to \"Decibell Peppers.\"Unfortunately, they have not only rejected each of my proposals, they have also blacklisted any future letters from processing through their mail department (For more information on this event, as well as other quarrels, pick up 'Hamund's Harassed Harangues, vol.IV')": "我亲自给皇家植物学家协会写了无数封信，拼命争取将这种草药的正式名称改为 \"Decibell Peppers\"。不幸的是，他们不仅拒绝了我的每一项提议，还将今后通过他们的邮件部门处理的任何信件列入黑名单（关于这一事件以及其他争吵的更多信息，请查阅《Hamund的骚扰性骚扰，第四卷》）。",
	"Tufted white grass, yeti brush is incredibly easy to miss among the sheets of snow through which it grows. Indeed, the very fact that yeti brush can manage to break through layers of ice and sleet to reach the sun is owed to a ridge-like adaptation on its stalks to slide through snow like a blade through flesh. Arctic communities have long since learned to wrap their shoes and gloves in this grass to aid their travels through deep snow.": "丛生的白草，在它生长的成片的雪地上，非常容易被错过。事实上，雪人草能够突破层层冰雪到达阳光下，是因为它的茎上有一个类似山脊的适应性，可以像刀片一样滑过雪地。北极社区早已学会用这种草包裹他们的鞋子和手套，以帮助他们在深雪中行走。",
	"You may spend 1 minute wrapping your hands and feet in this grass. If you do so, you suffer no penalty to your movement speed when moving through snowy or icy terrain, and you have advantage on climbing surfaces covered in ice or snow.": "你可以花1分钟时间将你的手和脚包裹在这种草中。如果你这样做，当你在雪地或冰雪地形中移动时，你的移动速度不会受到惩罚，而且你在攀登冰雪覆盖的表面时有优势。"
