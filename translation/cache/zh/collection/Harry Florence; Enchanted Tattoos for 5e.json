	"For centuries, Orcish warriors have adorned their bodies with marks that offer them unrivalled power and combat prowess. Given the curious nature of these markings, it was only a matter of time before the magical community, in particular the enchanting community, banded together to discover the secrets that Orcs have kept to themselves for centuries. Mastering this ‘new' enchanting art has so far been a slow process but gradually we're beginning to see an established professional field around the enchanting of tattoos.": "几个世纪以来，半兽人战士在他们的身体上装饰着印记，为他们提供无与伦比的力量和战斗力。鉴于这些标记的好奇性质，魔法界，特别是魔法界，联合起来发现半兽人几个世纪以来一直隐藏的秘密只是时间问题。到目前为止，掌握这种 \"新 \"的魔法艺术是一个缓慢的过程，但我们逐渐开始看到一个围绕着纹身魔法的专业领域。",
	"Players can now seek out a professional to gain proficiency in 'Tattooist Tools'. Alternatively, at the DM's discretion, a character may gain this proficiency via their background.": "玩家现在可以寻找一个专业人员来获得 \"纹身师工具 \"的熟练度。或者，在DM的决定下，角色可以通过他们的背景获得这种熟练度。",
	"Players may pay a tattoo artist a fee in exchange for a tattoo of their own. Certain professionals will be able to enchant these tattoos with magical effects that provide boosts to stats, allow for the casting of spells, and more.": "玩家可以向纹身师支付费用以换取自己的纹身。某些专业人员将能够为这些纹身注入魔法效果，提供属性提升，允许施展法术，以及更多。",
	"{@b Components}. Tattooist Tools include 5 bone and thorn needles which can be interchanged for different patterns and effects, a comb of needles to cover larger areas, a chisel to apply pressure to the needles, and 3 pots of black ink. Additional colours of ink as well as enchanted inks can be purchased from vendors.": "{@b Components}. 纹身师的工具包括5根骨针和刺针，可以互换不同的图案和效果，一把梳子可以覆盖更大的区域，一把凿子可以给针施加压力，还有3壶黑墨水。其他颜色的墨水和魔法墨水可以从供应商那里购买。",
	"{@b Arcana}. Proficiency in tattooist tools allows you proficiency in checks that have you detect enchantments that involve ink whether it be a tattoo or otherwise. For example, identifying an enchantment that has been placed on a letter to conceal information.": "{@b Arcana}. 对纹身师工具的精通使你能够熟练地检查出涉及墨水的魔法，无论是纹身还是其他。例如，识别被放置在信上以掩盖信息的魔法。",
	"{@b Sleight of Hand}. This tool proficiency provides additional insight in checks concerning intricate/artistic designs. For example, recognising a distinct handwriting design or an artistic signature across multiple works.": "{@b Sleight of Hand}. 这个工具的熟练程度为有关复杂/艺术设计的检查提供了额外的洞察力。例如，识别一个独特的笔迹设计或多个作品中的艺术签名。",
	"{@b Ink/Dye Crafting}. You can use this proficiency to, over the period of a short rest, mix Dyes and Inks using ash, dirt, blood, heavy metal extracts for colouring, etc. You can also use bone or plant materials to repair your tools. Tools degrade at a rate specified at the DM's discretion.": "{@b Ink/Dye Crafting}. 你可以利用这种能力，在短暂的休息时间内，用灰烬、泥土、血液、重金属提取物等混合染料和墨水进行着色。你也可以用骨头或植物材料来修复你的工具。工具退化的速度由DM决定。",
	"Design a simple tattoo": "设计一个简单的刺青",
	"Design a typical tattoo": "设计一个典型的刺青",
	"Design an intricate tattoo": "设计一个复杂的纹身",
	"The process of acquiring a tattoo that will become the base of this enchantment process is straightfoward. PCs must seek out a Tattoo Artist with the knowledge of tattoo application (read as a proficiency with tattooist tools). This artist can be an NPC the DM has inserted into the world or another PC. Once the PC has found someone capable of -- and willing to -- tattoo them, they will provide a design. These designs can be designed with a harder DC check by someone not proficient with tattooist tools or designed in conjunction with someone proficient in attempt to make the process easier.": "获得一个将成为这个魔法过程基础的纹身的过程很简单。个人必须找到一个具有纹身应用知识的纹身师（理解为熟练掌握纹身师的工具）。这个艺术家可以是DM在世界中插入的一个NPC，也可以是另一个PC。一旦PC找到了能够--并且愿意--为他们纹身的人，他们将提供一个设计。这些设计可以由不精通纹身工具的人用更难的DC检查来设计，也可以与精通的人一起设计，以试图使这个过程更容易。",
	"The design the player provides will determine the size and location of the tattoo. This affects the supplies and skill level needed to apply the tattoo which, in turn, affects the costs of the process. DMs should set the pricing at their own discretion but can use the following tables as a guideline depending on the factors present in the design. These factors can add up to a cumulative total or, probably more aptly, be figures to find a balance between.": "玩家提供的设计将决定纹身的大小和位置。这影响到应用纹身所需的用品和技能水平，这反过来又影响到过程的成本。管理员应自行决定定价，但可以根据设计中存在的因素，使用以下表格作为指导。这些因素可以累加成一个总数，或者更恰当地说，是在两者之间找到一个平衡的数字。",
	"If your players don't necessarily want to commit to getting a tattoo, you can consider giving temporary tattoos which can also be enchanted. If you choose this, settle on a time the tattoo hangs around for and perhaps a time the enchantment has an effect distinct from the time the tattoo lingers for. Temporary tattoos should also be cheaper to reflect their finite nature.": "如果你的玩家不一定想承诺去纹身，你可以考虑给临时纹身，这也可以被施以魔法。如果你选择了这种方式，就要确定纹身的停留时间，也许还有一个与纹身停留时间不同的魔法效果时间。临时纹身也应该更便宜，以反映其有限的性质。",

	"Occassionally, the process of getting a tattoo can be dangerous. At a DM's discretion, they can add checks to see how well this process goes over. If you believe the player is getting inked with unsanitary equipment, then add a Con save. Or perhaps you add a DC check to see if the tattoo looks how it should. Perhaps the artist you hired is still in training and now you've got the name of a dead team mate written across your neck with a few too many Rs in there.": "偶尔，获得纹身的过程可能会有危险。在DM的决定下，他们可以增加检查，看看这个过程进行得如何。如果你认为玩家是在用不卫生的设备进行纹身，那么就增加一个 \"反省\"。或者，你可以增加一个DC检查，看看纹身是否看起来应该如此。也许你雇佣的艺术家还在训练中，而现在你的脖子上写着一个死去的队友的名字，里面有很多的R。",
	"The second factor to take into account in the process of acquiring a tatto is time. Once again this is something that can be established at the DM's discretion as not every game will have downtime in excess that it may sometimes take to acquire a tattoo. For those that do have time to fill however, the tables provided can be used as a suggestion.": "在获得纹身的过程中要考虑的第二个因素是时间。这也是可以由管理员决定的，因为不是每个游戏都会有超过获得纹身所需的停机时间。然而，对于那些确实有时间的人来说，所提供的表格可以作为一个建议使用。",
	"The Process of enchanting a tattoo is not wholly different from the process of acquiring a tattoo. DM's can decide at their own discretion who has the power to enchant tattoos for their players; either fold the practice into the artists, give specialist wizards and sorcerers the power, or find another way to hand out enchantments.": "为纹身施展魔法的过程与获得纹身的过程并无完全不同。管理者可以自行决定谁有权力为他们的玩家施展纹身；或者将这种做法折合到艺术家身上，让专业的巫师和魔法师拥有这种权力，或者找到另一种发放魔法的方法。",
	"The enchanting process should ultimately be more expensive than the process of acquiring a tattoo in order to gate the more powerful enchantments from lower level players.": "施法过程最终应该比获得纹身的过程更昂贵，以便从低级别的玩家那里获得更强大的施法。",
	"Key to the process of enchanting a tattoo is the system through which the enchantment can be utilised. In order to make use of the enchantment, PCs must attune to the tattoo over the period of a short rest as they would an item. This system allows players a new source of magical effects while preventing late game parties from purchasing full body tattoos that give them intense stat boosts. Through this system, PCs will not be able to attune to more than three tattoos at a time, however, will be able to benefit from the magical effects of items that do not require attunement in slots that they would otherwise be utilising attunement items. Additionally, they can tattoo themselves with as many tattoos as their body will allow meaning they can customise their active enchantments to suit a situation over a short rest.": "对纹身施展魔法的过程的关键是可以利用该魔法的系统。为了使用魔法，NPC必须像对待物品一样，在短暂的休息时间内对纹身进行调整。这个系统让玩家有了一个新的魔法效果来源，同时防止游戏后期的玩家购买全身的纹身，使他们获得强烈的状态提升。通过这个系统，NPC将不能同时适应三个以上的纹身，但是，他们将能够从不需要适应的物品的魔法效果中获益，而这些物品本来是要利用适应物品的。此外，他们可以在自己的身体上纹上尽可能多的纹身，这意味着他们可以定制自己的主动魔法，以适应短暂休息的情况。",
	"The final factor that comes into play in the enchanting process is the power an enchantment can reach. Depending on the game, you might want to gate enchantments into three tiers with three different price points. A low tier enchantment being available at level 5, medium at level 10, and high at level 15. If a player recieves a low level enchantment that becomes redundant at a higher level, a second visit to an enchanter could perhaps upgrade the enchantment. You could also gate the enchantment power depending on the size and location of the tattoo if you so choose. Perhaps you give players access to a high level enchantment early but in return they had to commit to a full back tattoo that restricts further tattoos in that location.": "在施法过程中起作用的最后一个因素是施法者能达到的力量。根据游戏的情况，你可能想把魔法分为三个等级，有三个不同的价位。低级魔法在5级可以使用，中级在10级，高级在15级。如果玩家收到的低级魔法在更高的等级下变得多余，那么第二次去找魔法师也许可以升级该魔法。如果你选择的话，你也可以根据纹身的大小和位置来确定魔法的力量。也许你可以让玩家提前获得高等级的魔法，但作为回报，他们必须承诺在背部纹上一个完整的纹身，以限制在那个位置上的进一步纹身。",
	"Ultimately, if you're using this system it is incredibly important to consider what exactly would amount to an enchantment that hurts game balance in your setting.": "归根结底，如果你要使用这个系统，考虑在你的环境中到底什么才是伤害游戏平衡的魔法，是非常重要的。",
	"The following enchantments should not be considered sacrosant, tweak and create your own as you please these only exist to provide ideas. Players that want to create your own, check with your DM!": "以下的魔法不应该被认为是神圣的，你可以随心所欲地调整和创造你自己的魔法，这些只是为了提供想法。想自己创造的玩家，请与你的管理员联系。",

	"{@b Tattoo Style}: Ornate": "{@b Tattoo Style}: 饰面的",
	"Creature can utilise True Sight for up to 30 minutes per short rest. a creature with truesight can see in normal and magical darkness, up to 60 feet, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.": "拥有真视力的生物可以在普通和魔法黑暗中看到60英尺，看到不可见的生物和物体，自动检测视觉幻觉并成功地对其进行拯救，感知变形者或被魔法转化的生物的原始形态。此外，该生物可以看到虚空界。",
