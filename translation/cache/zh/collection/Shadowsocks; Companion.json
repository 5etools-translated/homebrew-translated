	"Even in the beginnings of your training, your unpredictably gliding motions are a defensive asset: you mystify by never staying still.

	"Also at 3rd level, choose one of the following talents:": "同样在3级时，从以下天赋中选择一个。",
	"Much to their dismay, you can use your partner's body as a bulwark. During any duet you perform with a grappled partner, you can gain the benefits of half cover by giving your partner a -2 penalty to their AC and Dexterity saving throws.": "让他们大失所望的是，你可以利用你的伙伴的身体作为堡垒。在你与被抓捕的伙伴进行的任何二重奏中，你可以通过给你的伙伴在他们的AC和灵巧救赎上施加-2的惩罚来获得半掩护的好处。",
	"With each step, you attain ecstasy from the glorifying thrill of exhibiting your sublime soul. For the duration of any duet you perform, you are put under the effect of the bless spell, while your partners are put under the effect of the bane spell.": "每走一步，你都能从展示你崇高灵魂的荣耀快感中获得狂喜。在你表演的任何二重奏中，你被置于祝福咒语的效果之下，而你的伙伴则被置于诅咒咒语的效果之下。",
	"When your partners' hopes are up, your onslaught crushes them. The first time on each of your turns when you hit one of your charmed duet partners with a melee weapon which you are wielding with both hands, you can double the result of your roll on one of your attack's damage dice.": "当你的伙伴们的希望破灭时，你的猛攻会粉碎他们。在你的每个回合中，当你用双手挥舞的近战武器击中你的魅力二重奏伙伴之一时，你可以将你的攻击的一个伤害骰子的掷出结果加倍。",
	"You refuse to abide by the will of any who would slight you. Your first weapon attack on each of your turns deals an additional 1d12 force damage if it hits a creature who has caused you to take damage since your previous turn.": "你拒绝遵从任何轻视你的人的意志。你在每个回合中的第一次武器攻击，如果击中了自你上一回合以来使你受到伤害的生物，会造成额外的1d12武力伤害。",
	"A double threat, your weapons defy all expectations. The first time on each of your turns when you hit your current duet partner with a weapon that is eligible for two-weapon fighting, you can automatically hit the same target with a second eligible melee weapon you have equipped, no bonus action required. You cannot add your ability modifier to the second attack's damage and cannot engage in two-weapon fighting on any turn when you activate this feature.": "双重威胁，你的武器违背了所有的期望。在你的每个回合中，当你用符合双武器战斗条件的武器击中你当前的二重奏伙伴时，你可以自动用你装备的第二件符合条件的近战武器击中同一目标，不需要额外动作。你不能在第二次攻击的伤害中加入你的能力修饰，并且在你激活此功能的任何回合都不能参与双兵器战斗。",
	"As a 6th level Dervish, even if your partner is unwilling, you always benefit from Vain Vivacity when one of your duets ends. Your partners never benefit from it.": "作为一个6级的Dervish，即使你的伙伴不愿意，当你的一个二重奏结束时，你总是能从 \"虚妄的活力 \"中获益。你的伙伴永远不会从中受益。",
	"When you reach 7th level, you strive to surpass all those who would show a moment of weakness. You can replace any flicker attack or weapon attack with a shove or grapple check against an adjacent creature. Additionally, you do not need to forgo damage when you activate an Aura property against one of your duet partners.": "当你达到第七级时，你会努力超越所有会表现出弱点的人。你可以用对相邻生物的推搡或抓取检查来代替任何闪烁的攻击或武器攻击。此外，当你对你的二重奏伙伴之一激活灵气属性时，你不需要放弃伤害。",
	"Starting at 11th level, your familiarity with discarding broken partners becomes your forte. Whenever one of your duets ends as a result of you reducing your partner to 0 hit points, you can cast your partner down and expend any remaining movement from your previous turn to approach another eligible or willing partner. If you end your movement within 5 feet of this partner, you can immediately begin a new duet at no tempo point cost, no action required.": "从11级开始，你对丢弃破碎伙伴的熟悉程度成为你的强项。每当你的一个二重奏因你将你的伙伴减少到0点而结束时，你可以将你的伙伴扔下，并消耗你上一回合的剩余行动来接近另一个符合条件或愿意的伙伴。如果你在这个伙伴的5英尺范围内结束你的行动，你可以立即开始一个新的二重奏，没有节奏点的代价，不需要任何行动。",
	"Upon achieving 15th level, the impossible becomes the everyday, as you can shape your soul to suit any situation. You can use simple and martial weapons as flicker weapons, attacking with them whenever you would make a flicker attack. As well, you've learned how to manifest your mood in even the most mundane armaments: when you hit a creature with any weapon, you can activate the Aura property of any flicker weapon you're proficient with.": "在达到第15级时，不可能的事情变成了日常，因为你可以塑造你的灵魂以适应任何情况。你可以将简单的武器和武术武器作为闪烁的武器，只要你想进行闪烁攻击，就可以用它们进行攻击。此外，你还学会了如何在最普通的武器中体现你的情绪：当你用任何武器击中一个生物时，你可以激活你所精通的任何闪烁武器的光环属性。",
	"Life with a Halcyon is like an oasis of heartwarming affection, bliss, and unquestionable safety. Those of this path are inclined not to pay any attention to their environment. Their gaze lies solely on their partners, and their desire to protect and serve those they hold dear is intense. In this style, you play the role of a doting caretaker.": "与哈尔西恩人在一起的生活就像一片绿洲，充满了温暖的感情、幸福和不容置疑的安全。走这条路的人倾向于不注意他们的环境。他们的目光只盯着他们的伴侣，他们保护和服务他们所珍视的人的愿望很强烈。在这种风格中，你扮演的是一个宠爱的看护者的角色。",
	"By level 3, you garner a mutual obsession. At the end of any short rest, name a friendly, willing creature to act as the target of your concern: your confidant. Until you choose someone else, or until they stop being willing, you and this creature have advantage on all skill checks made to socially influence or understand each other. Also, once per turn, you and your confidant can convey a single thought, idea, or emotion of up to 10 words in length to the other by making a particular gesture, moving an object in a certain way, giving the other a meaningful look, or making a distinct sound.": "到了第三级，你会获得一种相互的迷恋。在任何短暂的休息结束时，指定一个友好的、愿意的生物作为你关注的对象：你的知己。在你选择其他人之前，或者在他们不再愿意之前，你和这个生物在所有对社会影响或理解对方的技能检查中都有优势。另外，每回合一次，你和你的知己可以通过做一个特定的手势、以某种方式移动一个物体、给对方一个有意义的眼神、或发出一个独特的声音，向对方传达一个单一的思想、想法或情感，长度不超过10个字。",
	"Finally, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as your confidant, you can each feel the other's presence and can sense their exact location relative to you by visualizing their silhouette when you close your eyes. When you do so, you can see if their body language is trying to convey a thought to you, but cannot see their surroundings.": "最后，只要你和你的知己在同一个存在平面上，你们就能各自感受到对方的存在，并能通过闭上眼睛时想象他们的剪影来感知他们相对于你的确切位置。当你这样做时，你可以看到他们的身体语言是否试图向你传达一个想法，但不能看到他们的周围环境。",
	"Also as of 3rd level, your support takes on a sweeter, more nurturing tone, and every dance is an idyllic reverie.": "另外，从第三级开始，你的支持会有更甜美、更滋润的音调，每一次舞蹈都是田园诗般的遐想。",
	"Whenever one of your duets ends, salubrious waters are wrapped around either you or your partner, as your chosen recipient immediately regains hit points equal to 1d8 + half your companion level (rounded down).": "每当你的一个二重奏结束时，你或你的伙伴周围都会有温暖的水，因为你选择的接受者立即恢复相当于1d8+你同伴等级一半的命中率（向下取整）。",
	"As of 7th level, your attentive nature makes you quick to react to the one you're watching carefully. Every round when you're in combat with the creature you chose for Overbearing Ward, your initiative is set to be the same as theirs if you would act at a lower initiative. You can choose who goes first.": "从7级开始，你细心的天性使你对你仔细观察的人做出快速反应。每一轮当你与你选择的霸气病房的生物进行战斗时，如果你会以较低的主动权行动，你的主动权被设定为与他们相同。你可以选择谁先出手。",
	"Additionally, when you or this confidant are targeted with an attack while you're performing a duet together, either of you can, as a reaction, choose to become the target of the attack instead of the other. You also switch places with one another, entering the space which the other had occupied. This can be done a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest, and it must be done before you know whether the attack will hit.": "此外，当你或这个知己在一起表演二重奏时被攻击，作为反应，你们中的任何一个都可以选择成为攻击的目标而不是对方。你们也可以互相交换位置，进入对方曾经占据的空间。这样做的次数等同于你在每个长时区的熟练度加成，而且必须在你知道攻击是否会击中之前完成。",
	"Upon reaching 11th level, as you enlighten those around you, your significant other can fully reciprocate your solicitude. Whenever you use Merry Visionary to encourage your confidant, you can gain advantage on a single attack roll, ability check, or saving throw of your choosing before the start of your next turn, as their joy is your satisfaction.": "当你达到11级时，当你启迪你周围的人时，你的另一半可以完全回应你的关心。每当你使用 \"快乐幻象 \"来鼓励你的知己时，你可以在下一回合开始前在你选择的一次攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力上获得优势，因为他们的快乐就是你的满足。",
	"Further, at the start of every round, your confidant's initiative is set to be the same as yours if they would act at a lower initiative. Either of you can choose who goes first.": "此外，在每个回合开始时，如果你的知己会以较低的主动性行动，那么他们的主动性将被设定为与你相同。你们中的任何一方都可以选择谁先行动。",
	"At 15th level, you and your loved ones are forever reassured by considerate selflessness. Whenever you or your confidant uses Never Miss A Beat to become the target of an attack, the other regains hit points as per Jubilant Reminiscence.": "15级时，你和你所爱的人将永远因体贴的无私而感到安心。每当你或你的知己使用 \"永不错过 \"成为攻击的目标时，对方就会按照 \"欢乐回忆 \"恢复命中率。",
	"Further, you and your confidant can both cast detect thoughts at-will, no action required, but can only target each other. You can probe deeper into each other's thoughts as an action or bonus action and can choose to fail each other's probing saving throws. This spell uses your step save DC.": "此外，你和你的知己都可以随心所欲地施展探测思想，不需要任何行动，但只能针对对方。你们可以以行动或额外行动的方式深入探究对方的想法，并可以选择在对方的探究蓄力动作中失败。这个法术使用你的步数救赎DC。",
	"Few possess the sense to escort lost souls and help them pass on, for few can be trusted with such a personal request. As a Psychopomp, you send creatures to wherever they belong via trickery or compassion as necessary. This style uses shamanic services to find solutions for even the most hapless spirits. By seeking out sorrows and bringing ease to transitional phases, you act as a conciliating guardian.": "很少有人拥有护送迷失的灵魂并帮助他们度过难关的意识，因为很少有人能够信任这样的个人请求。作为一名精神病患者，你会根据需要通过诡计或同情心将生物送至它们所属的地方。这种风格使用萨满教的服务来为最无助的灵魂找到解决方案。通过寻找悲伤并为过渡阶段带来轻松，你充当了一个调和的守护者。",
	"By 3rd level, you know that the world you see isn't all there is. At-will, you can exhale a spectral mist to surround you in all directions, moving with you, passing through objects, and lightly obscuring an area within up to 30 feet of you. This mist remains until you dismiss it, no action required, or until you die. The maximum range of this mist increases to 60 feet at level 7, 90 feet at level 11, and 120 feet at level 15. While you are conscious, you can always sense the exact number of Small or larger creatures within this mist, though you cannot sense their location or their identity—only their presence. This includes creatures in the Ethereal Plane, such as ghosts.": "到了第三级，你知道你看到的世界并不是全部。根据意志，你可以呼出一团幽灵般的雾气，从四面八方围绕着你，与你一起移动，穿过物体，并轻度遮蔽你周围30英尺内的区域。这种雾气一直保持到你解除它为止，不需要任何行动，或者直到你死亡。这种雾的最大范围在7级时增加到60英尺，11级时增加到90英尺，15级时增加到120英尺。当你有意识的时候，你总是能感觉到这个迷雾中的小型或大型生物的确切数量，尽管你不能感觉到它们的位置或它们的身份，只能感觉到它们的存在。这包括虚空界的生物，如幽灵。",
	"Additionally, you can make happy haunts materialize. Whenever you have a willing humanoid ally within your mist, you can begin a duet with them from any distance. Rather than ending if your partner is no longer within 10 feet of you, your duets end instantly if your partner leaves your mist. A hazy illusion of each of you will appear to embrace the other during the dance, as distance cannot separate your spirits.": "此外，你可以让快乐的鬼魂变成现实。只要你有一个愿意的人形盟友在你的迷雾中，你就可以从任何距离开始与他们对唱。如果你的伙伴不再在你的10英尺范围内，你的二重唱就不会结束，而是在你的伙伴离开你的迷雾时立即结束。在舞蹈过程中，你们每个人都会出现一个朦胧的幻象来拥抱对方，因为距离无法将你们的精神分开。",
	"Also at 3rd level, you've discovered a number of obscure routines which grant you magic conducive to soulful shepherding. You know four Psychopomp spells, but you can only cast them as rituals. To do so, you must perform a mystical dance or cultural observance for 10 minutes in addition to the spell's normal casting time. These rituals can be performed during a short rest without being considered strenuous activity. You must possess the material components, and must maintain concentration whenever a spell requires it. Spells from this feature use your step save DC. Whenever you gain a Psychopomp Style feature, you learn additional spells which you can cast in this manner.": "同样在3级时，你发现了一些晦涩难懂的套路，这些套路赋予你有利于灵魂牧羊人的魔法。你会四种精神类法术，但你只能以仪式的方式施展它们。要做到这一点，除了法术的正常施法时间外，你必须进行10分钟的神秘舞蹈或文化纪念活动。这些仪式可以在短暂的休息中进行，而不被视为剧烈的活动。你必须拥有物质成分，并且每当咒语需要时必须保持注意力集中。这个功能的法术使用你的步数救赎DC。每当你获得一个心理学风格特征时，你就会学习额外的法术，你可以用这种方式来施展。",
	"Starting at 7th level, you can conceal your clientele, keeping them away from scrying eyes. Everything within the area of your mist is always under the effect of the nondetection spell.": "从第七级开始，你可以隐藏你的客户，让他们远离窥探的目光。在你的迷雾范围内的所有东西都会受到不被发现的法术的影响。",
	"Additionally, your all-encompassing empathy affords you new opportunities. Whenever a creature not native to your current plane, a spirit of the dead, or an undead creature enters the radius of your mist for the first time each round, it must make a Charisma saving throw. Upon failure, the creature is charmed by you, regarding you as its potential savior. This effect lasts until a target exits your mist's radius, but if you or your allies insult a target or harm it in any way, the effect ends early for them and they become immune to it for 24 hours. For the duration of the charm, affected creatures are placed under the effect of the {@spell tongues} spell.": "此外，你全方位的同理心为你提供了新的机会。每当非你当前位面的生物、亡灵或不死生物在每轮第一次进入你的迷雾半径时，它必须做一个魅力拯救动作。一旦失败，该生物就会被你迷住，将你视为其潜在的救世主。这个效果一直持续到目标离开你的迷雾半径为止，但是如果你或你的盟友侮辱了目标或以任何方式伤害了它，这个效果就会提前结束，他们会在24小时内对这个效果产生免疫。在符咒的持续时间内，受影响的生物会被置于（%0%）法术的效果之下。",
	"As of 11th level, your benevolence can free folks from the strife of battle. A number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per long rest, when a creature within your mist is reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you can choose to let their spirit rest. This can be done even if you are incapacitated or unconscious (as long as you are alive), and you can target yourself. They are stabilized when you spare them, and they become serene: until the end of the next round, they cannot take damage or regain hit points.": "从11级开始，你的仁慈可以将人们从战斗的纷争中解放出来。每次长时休息时，相当于你的魅力修改器的次数，当你的迷雾中的生物被降低到0点，但没有被彻底杀死时，你可以选择让他们的灵魂休息。即使你失去能力或失去意识也可以这样做（只要你还活着），而且你可以以自己为目标。当你放过他们时，他们会被稳定下来，他们会变得宁静：直到下一回合结束，他们不能受到伤害或重新获得命中率。",
	"All living creatures who see the target's peaceful visage are intuitively aware of this serenity's effect, and can instinctively discern that the target's slumber cannot be disturbed.": "所有看到目标的安详面容的生物都会凭直觉意识到这种安详的效果，并能本能地分辨出目标的沉睡不能被打扰。",
	"By the time you reach 15th level, you are in good standing as a walker between worlds. Whenever you directly reduce a creature to 0 hit points or stabilize them, you can put them under the effect of the {@spell plane shift} spell. You do not require the material component. The target is considered to be a willing creature, and you can specify their approximate destination. Even if they are serene, they regain 1 hit point upon arrival.": "当你达到15级时，你作为世界间的行者已经有了良好的地位。每当你直接将一个生物的命中率降至0或稳定他们时，你可以将他们置于（%0%）的法术效果之下。你不需要物质成分。目标被认为是一个自愿的生物，你可以指定他们的大致目的地。即使他们是宁静的，他们在到达时也会恢复1点命中率。",
	"Those who practice farsight tend to seek definitive answers wherever they go, but Soothsayers act on intuition. All around them are widespread strings of correlation, causation, and potentiality; everyone has a role to play in their schemes. In this style, your interest in creating your own truths grants you control over fate, and you demand a grand destiny.": "那些练习远见的人倾向于在任何地方寻求确定的答案，但占卜师是凭直觉行事。在他们周围广泛存在着相关、因果关系和潜在性的字符串；每个人都在他们的计划中扮演着一个角色。在这种风格中，你对创造自己的真理的兴趣赋予你对命运的控制权，你要求一个宏伟的命运。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, you can see signs of the world's potential. Before a long rest, you can name a creature and dream vaguely of their possibilities. Then, over the course of a short rest, you can teach them one skill, weapon, or tool proficiency by explaining how they acted in your dreams. As long as they are willing, they find this lesson to be effortless, as you ensure that it comes naturally to them. If they were already permanently proficient in a given skill or tool, you can teach them to double their proficiency bonus for ability checks pertaining to it. This lesson can only be completed once ever per target, and you can never teach yourself.": "从第三级开始，你可以看到世界潜力的迹象。在长时间休息之前，你可以说出一个生物的名字，并模糊地梦到他们的可能性。然后，在短暂的休息过程中，你可以通过解释他们在你梦中的表现来教他们一个技能、武器或工具的熟练程度。只要他们愿意，他们就会发现这一课毫不费力，因为你保证这对他们来说是自然的。如果他们已经永久地精通某项技能或工具，你可以教他们在与之相关的能力检查中获得双倍的熟练度奖励。这个课程在每个目标身上只能完成一次，而且你永远不能教自己。",
	"Additionally, you keep tabs on your pupils. At-will as an action, you can summon a sensor beside any creature you've taught through Sympathetic Sight. This sensor functions as per the {@spell clairvoyance} spell, except there is no range limit, and your sensor is visible, appearing as an insignia that is symbolic of you or your ideals. You can only focus on watching over one student at a time.": "此外，你还能监视你的瞳孔。随意作为一个动作，你可以在任何你通过交感视力教过的生物旁边召唤一个传感器。这个感应器的功能与{@spell clairvoyance}法术一样，只是没有范围限制，而且你的感应器是可见的，以象征你或你的理想的徽章的形式出现。你一次只能专注于观察一个学生。",
	"Also as of 3rd level, you know not to let your flighty chance escape you. Whenever you begin a duet step, you can conjure an aura boomerang and toss it at a Large or smaller creature or unrestrained object within 30 feet of you. Your boomerang spins intangibly within a target for the duration of the dance.": "同样从3级开始，你知道不要让你的飞行机会逃脱你。每当你开始一个二重奏步骤时，你可以变出一个光环回旋镖，并将它抛向你30英尺内的一个大型或小型生物或不受约束的物体。你的回旋镖在舞蹈的持续时间内无形地在目标内旋转。",
	"When the duet ends, the boomerang returns to you, and your target is pulled in a straight line into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. An unwilling creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw to avoid being pulled by figuring out how to remove your lure. If your target would collide with a creature, object, or hazard along the way, it is harmlessly released from flight immediately before reaching the obstacle. Your boomerang's range increases to 60 feet at 7th level, 90 feet at 11th level, and 120 feet at 15th level.": "当二重奏结束时，回旋镖回到你身边，你的目标会被直线拉到离你5英尺内的一个无人空间。不情愿的生物必须通过智力救赎成功，以避免被拉动，想办法移除你的诱饵。如果你的目标会与沿途的生物、物体或危险相撞，它会在到达障碍物之前被无害地释放。你的回旋镖的范围在7级时增加到60英尺，11级时增加到90英尺，15级时增加到120英尺。",
	"Upon reaching 7th level, you begin to preordain fortuity. A number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest, when a creature that you can see (other than yourself) makes an attack, before you know the result of their roll, you can speak a prediction aloud about whether it will hit or miss. If you correctly foresee the outcome, the target's fortune is reversed: their next attack within 1 minute will have the opposite outcome, automatically hitting if you said that they would miss and automatically missing if you predicted that they would hit. You cannot use this feature on a creature whose fortune is already currently reversed by it.": "在达到7级时，你开始预言偶然性。每次长时休息时，当你能看到的生物（除你自己外）进行攻击时，在你知道他们的卷轴结果之前，你可以大声地预测它是否会命中或不中。如果你正确地预见了结果，目标的命运就会被逆转：他们在1分钟内的下一次攻击会有相反的结果，如果你说他们会失手，就会自动击中，如果你预测他们会击中，就会自动失手。你不能对一个目前已经被它逆转了命运的生物使用这个特性。",
	"By 11th level, you're an expert at grooming your friends to handle tricky scenarios for you. At the end of a long rest, as you convene with any allies that have the Spellcasting feature, you can spend 10 minutes mingling your auras and edifying them about which spells they might soon have need of. If you do so, until they complete their next long rest, they can add additional spells of your choosing to their number of spells known or prepared. These spells must be of a level for which they have spell slots and must be from a spell list that is available to them. The total number of additional spells you can grant equals half your companion level (rounded down), divided as you choose among you and your allies.": "到了11级，你已经是培养你的朋友为你处理棘手情况的专家了。在长时间休息结束后，当你与任何具有法术功能的盟友聚会时，你可以花10分钟时间混合你们的灵气，并教导他们哪些法术他们可能很快就需要。如果你这样做，在他们完成下一次长时休息之前，他们可以将你选择的额外法术添加到他们已知或准备的法术数量中。这些法术的等级必须是他们有法术槽的，而且必须是他们可以使用的法术列表中的。你可以授予的额外法术总数等于你的同伴等级的一半（向下取整），由你选择在你和你的盟友之间分配。",
	"Once you achieve 15th level, for better or worse, your practiced tampering with providence has come to fruition. When one of your duet partners forces creatures to make a saving throw, by prophesying a terrible fate, you can make a single affected creature within sight roll its saving throw at disadvantage. You regain your single usage of this feature whenever you expend a tempo point to begin a new duet.": "一旦你达到15级，无论好坏，你所练习的篡改天意的行为就会有结果。当你的二重奏伙伴之一通过预言一个可怕的命运而迫使生物做出拯救动作时，你可以让视线范围内的一个受影响的生物在不利的情况下进行拯救动作。每当你花费一个节奏点开始一个新的二重唱时，你就会重新获得这个功能的单次使用权。",
	"Additionally, when an ally (other than yourself) would fail a saving throw against magic while wearing an accessory from your Counter-Curio feature, they can destroy the accessory, relinquishing its benefits and releasing its protective essence, allowing them to add a bonus to their saving throw result. This bonus equals your current number of tempo points.": "此外，当盟友（除你自己外）在佩戴你的反库里奥功能的饰品时，对魔法的救赎会失败，他们可以摧毁该饰品，放弃它的好处并释放它的保护性本质，让他们在救赎结果上增加一个奖励。这个奖励等于你当前的节奏点数。"
