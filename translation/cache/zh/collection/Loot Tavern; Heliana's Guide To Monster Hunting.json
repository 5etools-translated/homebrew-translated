Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC) we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling's Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution (DC 3 matches the wyrmling's +3 Constitution modifier).": "让我们以CR 4的红龙狼人的咬合攻击和呼吸武器为例。它的PB为+2，力量为19（+4），灵活性为10（+0），体质为17（+3）。它的咬合攻击有一个+6的修饰，而它的呼吸武器有一个DC13的灵巧蓄力。从这些数值中减去PB（从DC中减去8），我们剩下的是+4和DC 3。我们可以推断出，咬人攻击使用的是力量（+4与巫妖的力量修正值一致），而喷火使用的是体质（DC 3与巫妖的+3体质修正值一致）。",
	"As a tamer can only tame a CR 4 creature at 13th level, the wyrmling's PB increases from +2 to +5 when it be comes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16 respectively.": "由于驯兽师在13级时只能驯服一个CR4的生物，当它成为一个同伴时，狼人的PB从+2增加到+5。这导致它的攻击修饰和救赎DC分别增加到+9和DC16。",

	"When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans' own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon's cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans' coral home.": "当介壳虫交配时，一个可能涉及几十个个体的事件，所孕育的数千个幼虫定居在最近的基质上，通常是网虫自己的珊瑚家园。一旦扎根，幼虫就会发育成具有两项任务的多角体。第一个任务是在一个月的周期内长出一个新的介壳虫，然后把这个一英寸长的、受本能驱动的小家伙生到它家周围的水域中。第二个任务是分泌钙质外骨骼，把它们的身体与珊瑚礁融合在一起，使网蝽的珊瑚家园不断壮大。",
	"Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko'ulush (the ‘wild time'), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that \"trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls.\" Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko'malang (the ‘time of waiting').": "年轻的介壳虫的生命是脆弱的；它必须自食其力，在开放水域漂流，以浮游生物和其他介壳虫为食，直到它达到至少一英尺长，通常在第三年年底。在这个幼年阶段，也就是被称为uko'ulush（\"野生时间\"）的时期，介壳虫在很大程度上被其他网纹动物所忽视，它们认为 \"海洋的考验造就了最坚硬的珍珠\"。一旦一个cnidaran完成了这个幼年阶段，它就会被带入珊瑚礁，一个功利性的公共空间，在那里，珊瑚礁的习俗、文化和价值观被传递，即uko'malang（\"等待的时间\"）。",

	"When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko'fa (the ‘time of exploration'). Individuals that start on the uko'fa do so for a multitude of reasons Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs.": "当一个网纹动物达到成熟时，它可以选择在整个社区的祝福下离开珊瑚礁，这是一个一生一次的事件，被称为uko'fa（\"探索的时间\"）。开始uko'fa的人出于多种原因，有些人寻求从外面的世界带回宝物，并加强自己的社区。其他人觉得有必要分散，寻找其他珊瑚礁加入，甚至与旅行中遇到的志同道合的medusozoa组成新的珊瑚礁。",
	"Cnidaran settlements are alive Made of the bodies of millions of calcified polyps—cnidaran ancestors—a reef is more than just a home; it is the collective memory of a thousand generations, a traceable web of genealogical history, and an esteemed and holy sanctuary Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences: death, exile, or even being perceived as a declaration of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ It isn't unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef.": "珊瑚礁是有生命的，它是由数以百万计的钙化息肉--珊瑚礁的祖先--的身体组成的，它不仅仅是一个家，它是千秋万代的集体记忆，是可追溯的家谱历史网，是受人尊敬的神圣圣地。 故意破坏珊瑚礁会带来严重后果。如果船只被狂风吹离航线，工会支付巨额赔偿金是很正常的。",

	"The few times lotol ever come into conflict with neighbours, it is almost always to do with water A growing lotol population creates new wetlands by damming up rivers, sometimes to the chagrin of local trappers and woodsfolk.

	"Reusing and recycling are key tenets in the life of any mycelian Nothing is waste; rotten food can fatten a pig, a ruined shirt is a bandage waiting to happen, and corpses are new homes waiting for a little bit of reinvigoration Marginalised and persecuted by most societies, mycelians' propensity to recycle the recently deceased often brings them into conflict with other humanoids. That being said, graverobbers and less scrupulous grey market traders have been known to make a pretty penny out of selling ageing mycelians their next vessels.": "再利用和回收是任何菌类生活的关键原则 没有什么是浪费的；腐烂的食物可以养肥猪，毁坏的衬衫是等待发生的绷带，而尸体是等待一点点重生的新家 被大多数社会边缘化和迫害，菌类回收刚死去的人的倾向往往使他们与其他人类发生冲突。也就是说，盗墓者和不太讲究的灰色市场商人已经知道，他们可以通过出售老化的菌丝人的下一个容器来赚取大量的钱财。",

	"The key to distinguishing a mycelian from a zombie, of course, is the smell Mycelians carry a hearty, musky aroma like that of a vivacious forest floor. Undead, on the other hand, carry the putrid-sweet scent of decay. After several unfortunate interactions with necromancer-hunters, the Sisters of Mercy began employing dogs, with their keen sense of smell, to help differentiate between innocent mycelians and undead artifice.": "当然，区分菌丝体和僵尸的关键是气味。 菌丝体带有一种丰满的、麝香般的香气，就像活泼的森林地面一样。另一方面，亡灵则带有腐烂的甜味。在与死灵法师猎手进行了几次不幸的互动之后，慈悲修女会开始雇用狗，用它们敏锐的嗅觉来帮助区分无辜的菌丝体和亡灵的假象。",
	"With each new host, a mycelian's psyche changes a little, moulded by the brain, body, and abilities of the host it co-opts In moving from one host to another, a mycelian also leaves behind some of its own memories, forever lost to the decay of time Despite being potentially thousands of years old, the longest-living communities of mycelians often have memories stretching back only a few decades For this reason, mycelians conduct a ritual shortly before death, where they recant a rhythmic history of their exploits in this host, adding it to the oral history of their community These oral histories can be days long, and minor word changes (or ‘linguistic decay' as scholars refer to it) have resulted in tales becoming more and more outlandish the further back in time they occurred.": "每到一个新的宿主，菌丝体的心理就会发生一些变化，被它所合作的宿主的大脑、身体和能力所塑造。在从一个宿主转移到另一个宿主时，菌丝体也会留下自己的一些记忆，永远地消失在时间的腐烂中。尽管可能有几千年的历史，但最长寿的菌丝体群体的记忆往往只有几十年。菌丝族人在死前不久会举行一个仪式，他们会有节奏地讲述他们在这个宿主身上的经历，并将其加入到他们社区的口述历史中。 这些口述历史可能长达数天，轻微的词汇变化（或学者们所说的 \"语言衰减\"）导致故事变得越来越离奇，它们发生的时间越久。",
	"Every mycelian oral history has one thing in common: its beginning These stories all start with the ‘Mothershroom', a behemoth fungal organism and progenitor to all mycelians In some stories, the Mothershroom takes the form of a giant, multi-coloured tree In others, it is a miles-wide web of interconnecting, pulsing hyphae that thrum with thought and feeling. Despite their best efforts, no mycelian, explorer, or scholar has ever found the mothershroom Any knowledge of its location—if it even exists—has been lost to the grinding wheel of time.": "每个菌类口述历史都有一个共同点：它的开始 这些故事都是从 \"母菇 \"开始的，它是一种巨大的真菌生物，也是所有菌类的祖先 在一些故事中，母菇的形式是一棵巨大的、多色的树 在另一些故事中，它是一个数英里宽的、相互连接的、脉动的菌丝网，它带着思想和感觉。尽管他们做出了最大的努力，但没有任何菌丝体、探险家或学者找到过蘑菇母体，任何关于它的位置的知识--如果它真的存在的话--都被时间的车轮碾碎了。",
