	"When you cast this spell, you can cause an area of an object no larger than 5 cubic feet to age rapidly. This may cause things like wood to rot, metal to rust and food to spoil. It can only target non-magical objects not being worn or carried.": "当你施展这个法术时，你可以使一个不超过5立方英尺的物体的一个区域迅速老化。这可能会导致诸如木材腐烂、金属生锈和食物变质。它只能针对没有被佩戴或携带的非魔法物品。",
	"When delay image is cast, the recipient is surrounded by a thin magical aura that bends time slightly, causing the person's image to appear one second behind the actual motion. This gives the target a +2 to their AC. This spell can be used in conjunction with other armour-class-affecting spells, but it is not cumulative with itself. The reverse of spell this is Advance Image, When Advance Image is cast, the recipient must make an intelligence saving throw vs Spell DC or is surrounded by a thin magical aura that bends time slightly, causing a second image to appear one second in front of their actual motion. This gives the target a -4 to their AC. The recipient can retake the save at the end of its turn.": "当延迟影像被施放时，接受者会被一个薄薄的魔法光环所包围，这个光环会使时间稍微弯曲，导致这个人的影像出现在实际运动的一秒钟之后。这使目标在他们的交流中获得+2的效果。这个法术可以和其他影响盔甲类的法术一起使用，但它本身不能累积。与此相反的法术是 \"前进影像\"，当 \"前进影像 \"被施放时，受术者必须对法术DC进行智力储蓄，或者被一个薄薄的魔法光环所包围，使时间稍微弯曲，导致第二个影像出现在他们实际运动的一秒钟之前。这使目标在他们的AC上有一个-4。受术者可以在其回合结束时重新进行拯救。",
	"Upon casting this spell, the caster may gain a general knowledge of a single event to come. The event must affect the caster in some way. (An event that would affect another character in the party might count, especially if the caster relies on other party members for safety.) The chronological range is 10 minutes into the future per level of the spell, and the spell centres on the most important event during that time. Information is frequently misleading—the caster might discover that gambling will bring good fortune, only to find out after losing 50 gp that the winner wishes to hire him for an adventure—and there is always a 10% chance that the information is wrong.": "施放此法术后，施法者可以获得对即将发生的单一事件的一般知识。该事件必须以某种方式影响施法者。(一个会影响党内其他角色的事件可能也算在内，特别是如果施法者依赖其他党员的安全。） 时间范围是每一级法术的未来10分钟，而法术的中心是这段时间内最重要的事件。信息经常是误导性的--施法者可能会发现赌博会带来好运，但在输掉50金币后却发现赢家希望雇佣他去冒险，而且总有10%的机会信息是错误的。",
	"With the use of this spell, the caster can rapidly alter the growth of any non-magical plant in a 60ft sphere around them. For every round, the caster concentrates on this spell, plants around the caster age or regress by one month": "使用这个咒语，施法者可以迅速改变他们周围60英尺范围内任何非魔法植物的生长。施法者每专注于此法术一轮，施法者周围的植物就会衰老或倒退一个月。",
	"For every round, the caster concentrates on this spell, plants around the caster age or regress by one month": "施法者每专注于此法术一回合，施法者周围的植物就会衰老或倒退一个月。",
	"By means of a timeslip spell, the barrier between reality and Temporal Prime is thinned, and the caster instantly slips between the two and is replaced back in time at the end of their next turn. Any creatures attempting to attack someone who is trying to timeslip away must make an Intelligence saving throw vs the spells DC or lose their action used for the attack.": "通过时空跳跃的法术，现实与时空主宰之间的屏障被削弱，施法者瞬间滑入两者之间，并在下一回合结束时被替换回时间。任何试图攻击正在尝试时空跳跃的人的生物都必须对法术的DC进行智力储蓄，否则就会失去他们用于攻击的行动。",
	"When this spell is cast, the caster may change one action performed in their immediate past. The number of seconds back that the caster can affect is equal to the six times the level of the spell (1 round per level). If an action is taken that would've prevented combat or another major event, the caster and Dungeon Master must work out a reasonable course of events that would make up for the lost time.": "当这个法术被施放时，施法者可以改变在他们眼前进行的一个动作。施法者所能影响的回溯秒数等于该法术等级的6倍（每级1轮）。如果采取的行动会阻止战斗或其他重大事件的发生，施法者和地下城管理员必须制定一个合理的事件进程来弥补失去的时间。",
	"With this spell, the user is able to restore expended charges from a magical item prematurely. When cast on the item it regains its charge as long as it is a rare item or less, if the item has multiple charges it regains three charges for a common item, 2 for an uncommon and 1 for a rare item. If the charge on the item would usually take longer than a day to change naturally, this spell will reduce that time by 24.": "通过这个咒语，使用者能够提前恢复魔法物品中消耗的电荷。当对物品施法时，只要它是稀有物品或更少，它就能恢复其电荷，如果物品有多个电荷，普通物品能恢复3个电荷，不常见的能恢复2个，稀有物品能恢复1个。如果物品上的电荷通常需要超过一天的时间来自然改变，这个咒语将使时间减少24。",
	"When this spell is cast, the affected creature must make an Intelligence saving throw or loses its sense of time. It is perpetually late, unable to function under any time restraints. This spell is merely an annoyance unless accurate timing is crucial. Creatures afflicted by this spell automatically set their initiative count to 0 (winning any ties) and are always surprised if attacked from stealth. In combat, creatures with multiple attacks automatically lose one attack and are unable to follow a battle plan that requires accurate timing. Against a chronomancer or creature of Temporal Prime, this spell is particularly useful. Any chronomancer under the disjunction who attempts to cast a time-affecting spell automatically fails.": "当这个咒语被施放时，受影响的生物必须做一个智力储蓄动作，否则就会失去时间感。它永远都会迟到，无法在任何时间限制下运作。除非准确的时间是至关重要的，否则这个咒语只是一种烦扰。受此法术影响的生物会自动将他们的主动权计数设为0（赢得任何平局），并且如果从隐身状态下被攻击，总是会感到惊讶。在战斗中，拥有多次攻击的生物会自动失去一次攻击，并且无法遵循需要准确时机的战斗计划。对付计时法师或时空主宰的生物，这个法术特别有用。任何处于分离状态下的chrononomancer如果试图施放一个影响时间的法术，就会自动失败。",
	"Upon casting this spell, the caster creates a time loop in the creature's mind that causes it to repeat this round's action indefinitely.": "施法者在施放此法时，会在生物的头脑中创造一个时间循环，使其无限期地重复本回合的行动。",
	"If the creature attacked, it attacks the same person again. If it drank a potion, it drinks from the same bottle again. Even if something happens to prevent this attempt (the opponent is dead, or someone takes the bottle away), the subject still strives to repeat its last action. The victim makes an intelligent save vs your spell DC at the end of every round it is affected by the spell until the loop is broken.": "如果该生物受到攻击，它就会再次攻击同一个人。如果它喝了药水，它就从同一个瓶子里再喝一次。即使发生了一些事情阻止了这一尝试（对手已经死亡，或者有人拿走了瓶子），该生物仍然努力重复它的最后一次行动。受害者在每一回合结束时对你的咒语DC进行一次智能救赎，直到循环被打破。",
	"Upon casting Temporal Push, the caster opens a partial slipgate to Temporal Prime and attempts to force a creature through it. This slipgate is not fully formed, so the subject automatically slips back to reality at a later time. The creature is thrown forward up to twice the spells level in rounds. ": "在施展时空推演时，施法者会打开一个通往时空主宰的部分滑门，并试图迫使一个生物通过它。这个滑门并没有完全形成，所以被试者会在以后的时间里自动滑回现实。该生物被抛向前方，最多可以抛出两倍于法术等级的回合。",
	"The amount must be decided before the spell is cast. The spell removes the creature from reality for a limited time, allowing the caster to deal with other problems or prepare a welcome for the returning creature. The affected creature is not aware of any passage of time. Everything seems to shift about suddenly. If a physical presence is occupying the space to be returned to, the creature is displaced slightly on return.": "数量必须在施法前决定。该咒语在有限的时间内将该生物从现实中移除，使施法者能够处理其他问题或为返回的生物准备欢迎仪式。受影响的生物不知道任何时间的流逝。一切似乎都在突然转变。如果一个物理存在占据了要返回的空间，那么该生物在返回时就会有轻微的位移。",
	"This spell takes a creature and pushes its body backwards in time to a point at which it was in better health. This simulates a healing ability without using clerical powers. Time is of the essence when using this spell, though, as the farther into the past the body is pushed, the higher the chance of failure. The caster can push the body back one round in time for every level the spell is cast at. For example, a 9th-level casting of this spell is guaranteed to restore a person back to the state of health they were in nine rounds ago. For every additional round that the caster attempts to push the body backward in time, there is a cumulative 10% chance of failure. If the 9th-level spell slot were used this spell to heal a warrior wounded just over 14 rounds before the spell was cast, that would be 5 rounds further than the caster could guarantee success, so the spell would have a 50% chance of failing.": "这个咒语使一个生物在时间上向后推到它健康状况较好的一个点。这模拟了一种治疗能力，而无需使用牧师的力量。不过使用这个法术时，时间是最重要的，因为身体被推到过去越远，失败的机会就越大。施法者可以在施法的每一等级中把身体推回一回合。例如，9级施法可以保证将一个人恢复到9轮前的健康状态。施法者每增加一轮试图将身体向后推的时间，就有累计10%的失败机会。如果用9级法术槽来治疗一个在施法前刚刚超过14个回合的受伤的战士，这将比施法者能保证成功的时间多出5个回合，所以这个法术将有50%的失败机会。",
	"Time Heal cannot recall a spirit from death and therefore is only useful on a still-living character. A dead body that has Time Heal cast on it may be entirely healed, but it remains dead, as the body's spirit has fled. If the spirit can somehow be reunited with the body (say through raise dead), the patient will then be alive and as well as the time heal can make them. Time Heal can also be used to hurt an opponent that has just healed itself. In this case, the caster must successfully touch the target, and the target gets to make a constitution saving throw vs your spell DC. Any healing (or damage) done to the target is reverted to an earlier state. The standard chances of failure still apply.": "时间治疗不能把灵魂从死亡中召回，因此只对仍然活着的角色有用。被施以 \"时间治疗 \"的死尸可能被完全治愈，但它仍然是死的，因为尸体的灵魂已经逃走了。如果精神能够以某种方式与身体重合（例如通过复活），那么病人就会活着，并且和时间治疗所能带来的一样好。时间愈合也可以用来伤害一个刚刚治愈自己的对手。在这种情况下，施法者必须成功地接触目标，而目标可以对你的咒语DC进行体质拯救。任何对目标造成的治疗（或伤害）都会恢复到早期状态。标准的失败几率仍然适用。",
	"When Temporal stasis is cast a sphere with a 10ft radius spring into existence, anything caught in the sphere makes a dexterity saving throw vs your spell DC to get away from it and be placed safely next to it or becomes suspended in time, anything in the sphere does not experience the flow of time, anything that tries to enter the sphere is also suspended in it and makes no saving throw, anything in the sphere is effectively indestructible as nothing can affect it, the spell for the duration or until dispelled.": "当时空静止被施放时，一个半径为10英尺的球体就会出现，任何被卷入球体的东西都要对你的法术攻击力做一个灵巧的判断，以脱离球体并被安全地放置在球体旁边，否则就会被悬浮在时间中，球体中的任何东西都不会经历时间的流动，任何试图进入球体的东西也会被悬浮在球体中，并且不做任何判断，球体中的东西实际上是不可摧毁的，因为没有任何东西可以影响它，法术持续时间或直到被驱散。",
	"A shimmering transparent sphere springs 60ft around the targeted point. In this sphere, the rules of space are relative. Any intelligent creature in the sphere can bend reality to their will allowing them to change things like gravity, temperature, and atmosphere for themselves.": "一个闪闪发光的透明球体在目标点周围60英尺处弹出。在这个球体中，空间的规则是相对的。球体中的任何智慧生物都可以按照他们的意愿弯曲现实，允许他们为自己改变重力、温度和大气等事物。",
	"The caster is automatically aware of this fact, but any creature that is not must make an investigation check vs your spell DC the end of their turn to be able to change things in the sphere.": "施法者会自动意识到这一事实，但任何没有意识到的生物必须在他们的回合结束时对你的法术进行调查检验，以能够改变球体中的事物。",
	"Objects in the sphere behave strangely, for example an arrow fired from a bow will remain stationary for the duration of the spell as soon as it leaves the bow, but if someone was to touch the arrow in this state the energy would instantly transfer to the creature and take damage, also objects that require a chemical reaction, heat or gravity to function cease to work in the sphere unless held by someone.": "球体中的物体会表现得很奇怪，例如，从弓上射出的箭在咒语的持续时间内会保持静止，但如果有人在这种状态下接触箭，能量会立即转移到生物身上并受到伤害，同样需要化学反应、热量或重力才能发挥作用的物体也会在球体中停止工作，除非有人持有。",
	"When paradox is cast, the caster may alter a minor event from his past that may affect the present. Such an event could be exchanging one memorized spell for a more useful one, having bought a cask of ale instead of a keg of oil, or deciding that, instead of insulting the orks chieftain (who has been harbouring a grudge, and now the characters need his help), the heroes insulted their finest warrior.": "当悖论被施放时，施法者可以改变他过去的一个可能影响现在的小事件。这样的事件可以是用一个记忆中的法术换取一个更有用的法术，买了一桶啤酒而不是一桶油，或者决定不侮辱兽人酋长（他一直怀恨在心，现在人物需要他的帮助），而是侮辱他们最好的战士。",
	"The event to be changed should not be more than three hours in duration, and it must be something that was personally done by the caster, or something the caster could have influenced. (Perhaps a thief actually made the insult, and the caster uses paradox to explain it away at the expense of the ork warrior.) The caster can change an event as far back as one month. It is the Dungeon Master's call as to how the change proceeds forward, if at all. Often, things will not work out as neatly as the caster might hope.": "要改变的事件不应超过三个小时，而且必须是施法者亲自做的事情，或者是施法者可以影响的事情。(也许一个盗贼真的做出了侮辱行为，而施法者用悖论来解释它，牺牲了那个兽人战士的利益）。施法者可以改变一个月前的事件。至于如何进行改变，如果有的话，是由地下城主决定的。通常情况下，事情不会像施法者希望的那样顺利进行。",
	"This spell allows the caster to scry people or places from a different time. This operates through the caster's mind, and any innate abilities or spell effects placed on the caster apply. The chance for scrying success, as well as the chance for detection, are the same as those of scrying typically. Scrying into a different time offers no further penalty. In any case, a spell that detects scrying detects a temporal eye.": "这个咒语允许施法者从不同的时间探查人或地方。该法术通过施法者的头脑进行操作，并且适用于施法者的任何先天能力或法术效果。窥探成功的几率以及侦测的几率与通常的窥探相同。窥探到不同的时间不会带来进一步的惩罚。在任何情况下，检测窥探的法术都会检测到一个时空之眼。",
	"This spell changes a single important event in the caster's past. This is just like the spell paradox, but the event can be up to one year past. Such an event could be changing from a Wizard to a Warlock, acquiring proficiency in smithing tools rather than glassblowers tools.": "这个咒语改变了施法者过去的一个重要事件。这就像法术悖论一样，但事件可以是过去一年。这样的事件可以是从巫师变成术士，获得熟练的铁匠工具而不是玻璃吹制者工具。",
	"Or deciding to research a new spell rather than create a new magical item. The event must be one the caster had control of at the time, and something should always be given up. The change should always be evident but not necessarily work the way the caster hopes for. ": "或者决定研究一个新的法术而不是创造一个新的魔法物品。该事件必须是施法者当时可以控制的，而且应该总是放弃一些东西。变化应该总是显而易见的，但不一定按照施法者希望的方式进行。",
	"The DM should also feel free to remove any items or relationships he feels would not have been found as a result of the caster's meddling. After all, the things that are changed likely were important to the caster at one time. Also, the turbulence always has a 50% chance of attracting a time-dimensional Guardian from Temporal Prime": "DM也应该自由地删除他认为不会因为施法者的干涉而被发现的任何物品或关系。毕竟，那些被改变的东西很可能曾经对施法者很重要。此外，湍流总是有50%的机会吸引来自时空主宰的时空守护者。",
	"This spell sends the minds of willing creatures within 10 ft of the caster up to 50 years back in time into their younger bodies. ": "这个法术将施法者10英尺范围内愿意的生物的思想送回他们年轻时的身体，最多50年。",
	"This, however, does not send back the physical characteristic of the affected creatures Only the mental ones; so a wizard will still have all their prepared spells, but a barbarian will not have their current strength. ": "然而，这并不送回受影响的生物的身体特征，只是送回精神特征；所以一个巫师仍然会有他们所有准备好的法术，但一个野蛮人不会有他们当前的力量。",
	"likewise, items are also not transported back, preventing the preparation of spells not in your younger minds spellbook. If the spell would cause the mind to enter the body of a child or younger, it will fail. ": "同样地，物品也不会被传送回来，防止准备不在你年轻心灵法术书中的法术。如果咒语会导致心灵进入儿童或更年轻的身体，它将失败。",
	"If you are under this effect, you may bring your mind back to the current time by taking a short rest and choosing to come back.": "如果你受到这种影响，你可以通过短暂的休息并选择回来，使你的思想回到当前时间。",
	"You launch a capsule forward in time to a destination and time set by you, this destination and time can be a static command such as \"100 years in the future at the centre of the golden hills\". or it can be a fluid command such as \" 10 minutes after I die at the nearest safe location available \". ": "你将一个太空舱发射到你设定的目的地和时间，这个目的地和时间可以是一个静态的命令，如 \"未来100年的金色山丘中心\"。 也可以是一个流动的命令，如 \"我死后10分钟，在最近的安全地点\"。",
	"The capsule and its occupants do not experience time between the casting of the spell, and when it jumps to its intended location and time, rather the travel appears to be instantaneous. If no such location exists at the specified time or the command creates a paradox, such as sending an object to itself in the future, the capsule goes to the closest time and location described by you it can or simply fails and consumes the spell slot.": "胶囊和它里面的人在施法和跳到预定地点和时间之间不经历时间，相反，旅行似乎是瞬间的。如果在指定的时间没有这样的地点，或者命令产生了悖论，比如把一个物体送到未来的自己身边，那么胶囊就会去到你所描述的最接近的时间和地点，或者干脆失败，消耗掉法术槽。",
	"Upon casting this spell, the caster manipulates time in respect to a creature. A creature ages up to two months per level of the spell. The amount of ageing must be decided before the spell is cast. Ageing occurs at a rate of one month per turn. The creature must make a constitution throw vs your spell DC or gain two levels of exhaustion. Any actions or movement the creature takes during the process occur is at half its normal ability (loses half its attacks, move base is halved, and so on). The material component necessary for this spell is a piece of bio-matter from the type of creature to be affected.": "在施展此法术时，施法者会操纵与生物有关的时间。一个生物在每一级法术中最多衰老两个月。衰老的数量必须在施法前决定。衰老的速度为每回合一个月。该生物必须对你的法术DC进行体能投掷，否则会获得两级的疲惫。在此过程中，该生物的任何行动或运动都是以其正常能力的一半发生的（失去一半的攻击，移动基础减半，等等）。这个法术所需的物质成分是一块来自受影响的生物的生物物质。",
	" If the caster touches the creature during the spell, no material component is required. The reverse of this spell, reverse creature growth, reduces the age of the affected creature by up to one month per spells level to a minimum age of one month. The amount of change must be decided before the spell is cast, and the reversal occurs at a rate of one month every two turns. The rules for the material component are the same.": " 如果施法者在施法过程中接触到该生物，则不需要物质成分。这个法术的反面，逆转生物的成长，使受影响的生物的年龄在每个法术等级中最多减少一个月，最小年龄为一个月。变化的数量必须在施法前决定，而且逆转以每两轮一个月的速度发生。材料成分的规则是相同的。",
	"When you cast this spell you may curse someone with the burdens of time; they must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take {@damage 1d6} necrotic damage and have their base speed reduced to 10 feet until the end of their next turn.": "当你施展这个法术时，你可以用时间的负担来诅咒某人；他们必须在智力救赎中成功，否则会受到{@damage 1d6}的坏死伤害，并且他们的基本速度降低到10英尺，直到他们下一个回合结束。",
