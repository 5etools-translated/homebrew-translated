	"The corruption drains you to the point of weariness. You suffer one point of exhaustion.": "腐败使你疲惫不堪。你遭受一分的疲惫。",
	"Corruption and its effects can be presented in a variety of ways depending on where it's encountered. Deep in the Underdark, magical radiation known to the drow as {@b faerzress} slowly twists and reshapes all that it touches. In Anchoromé, a decades-long war left a scar of corruption between Revonar and Dari Sinora known as {@b the Lash}. In Eberron, dual-planar junctions known as {@b manifest zones} sometimes bear aspects of corruption originating from Mabar, the plane of Endless Night, or Xoriat, the Realm of Madness.
