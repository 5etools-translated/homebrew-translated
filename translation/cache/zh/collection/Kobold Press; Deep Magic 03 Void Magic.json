	"Ancient stories tell of the creation of all existence by means of spoken words that spun reality from the void. The words of creation are powerful, but—as light creates shadow—so too does creation cause destruction. Whispers of the ancient words of creation seeped into the narrow spaces between existence and nonexistence, and those whispers echo to this day. The power-hungry, the desperate, and the mad can find such whispers—with great effort and terrible risk. When spoken aloud or inscribed correctly, these words draw the power of nonexistence into the speaker's magic": "古老的故事告诉我们，所有的存在都是通过说话的方式创造出来的，从虚空中旋转出现实。创造的话语是强大的，但正如光创造影子一样，创造也会造成破坏。古老的创造之语的低语渗入了存在与不存在之间的狭窄空间，这些低语一直回响到今天。渴望权力的人、绝望的人和疯狂的人可以找到这样的低语--要付出巨大的努力和可怕的风险。当大声说出或正确刻下时，这些话语将不存在的力量引向说话者的魔力",
	"The ultimate source of power that drives void magic is unclear. In most respects, a void magic spell is nearly identical to conventional magic and reaches toward the same mystical forces for its energy. The addition of void speech into the spell's verbal component, however, subtly alters the spell at the moment of casting, so that the spell reaches beyond the usual wells of arcane or divine power to siphon energy from strange realms of darkness, madness, and horror.": "驱动虚空魔法的最终力量来源还不清楚。在大多数方面，虚空魔法的咒语几乎与传统魔法相同，并向相同的神秘力量获取能量。然而，在咒语的言语成分中加入虚空言语，在施法的那一刻巧妙地改变了咒语，使咒语超越了通常的奥术或神力之井，从黑暗、疯狂和恐怖的奇怪领域吸取能量。",
	"Several hypotheses exist to explain void magic's origin, from tapping the power of the Great Old Ones to drawing the last energy of a dying multiverse, but the truth is knotted in an enigma that can't be untied without tangling oneself in madness.": "有几种假设可以解释虚空魔法的起源，从挖掘伟大的旧人的力量到汲取垂死的多元宇宙的最后能量，但真相被打上了一个谜团，如果不把自己纠缠在疯狂中就无法解开。",
	"At the heart of the enigmatic and dangerous school of void magic lies in void speech. The glyphs and spoken words of the void are the essence of oblivion given form. They exist in a paradoxical state, and as such they corrupt and degrade physical reality around them. Void speech is dangerous under any circumstance, even when not infused with magic. Those who correctly enunciated void speech find it impossible to comprehend, but they know in their bones that what they hear is terrible. Splitting headaches, sudden nosebleeds, spoiled food, and cracked glass follow a void speech pronouncement by a particularly powerful speaker.": "虚空魔法这一神秘而危险的流派的核心在于虚空言语。虚空的字形和口头语是遗忘的本质，被赋予了形式。它们以一种矛盾的状态存在，因此，它们腐蚀并降低了周围的物理现实。虚空言语在任何情况下都是危险的，即使没有被注入魔法。那些正确发音的虚空言语发现它不可能被理解，但他们骨子里知道他们听到的是可怕的东西。头痛欲裂，突然流鼻血，食物变质，玻璃破裂，这些都是由一个特别强大的演讲者的虚无言语宣读的。",
	"Inscribed void glyphs are not much safer. Readers often bleed from their eyes or suffer blurred vision. Paper bearing a glyph blackens over time, and even stone carved with the blasphemous glyphs eventually takes on a slimy texture and becomes pitted, corrupt, and foul. Explorers and scholars who stumble across a preserved void glyph have gone mad from the sudden shock to their souls. Despite the corrupting nature of such glyphs, the substance upon which they're inscribed never seems to degenerate completely—it rots and becomes loathsome, but it seemingly lasts forever in that corrupted state.": "刻写的空白字形并不怎么安全。读书人常常眼睛出血或视力模糊。刻有字形的纸张会随着时间的推移而变黑，甚至刻有亵渎性字形的石头最终也会呈现出粘稠的质地，变得坑坑洼洼、腐烂和污秽。偶然发现保存下来的虚空石刻的探险家和学者们，由于灵魂受到突然的冲击而发疯。尽管这种石刻具有腐蚀的性质，但刻在上面的物质似乎从未完全退化--它腐烂并变得令人厌恶，但它似乎永远保持着这种腐败的状态。",
	"Void speech and the magic that derives from it thrives in the darkest places of creation. The Great Old Ones murmur it to their follows during cultists' grimmest nightmares. Creatures that dwell far from mortal worlds in the frigid black expanses between the stars came across the secrets long ago, catching whispers in the silence. Void dragons, star-spawn, and other hoarders of ancient knowledge and power possess scraps of speech cultivated into power.": "虚空之语和源于它的魔法在创世的最黑暗的地方茁壮成长。伟大的老者在崇拜者最可怕的噩梦中对他们的追随者喃喃自语。居住在远离凡人世界的星际间寒冷的黑色地带的生物很久以前就发现了这些秘密，在寂静中捕捉到了低语。虚空龙、星际精灵和其他古代知识和力量的囤积者拥有被培养成力量的言论碎片。",
	"Chief among earthly creatures who gather and study the power of the void are the aboleth. Those ancient creatures discovered void speech long ago, when the nihileth returned from distant wanderings. Void speech formed the basis of the maddening glyph language that adorns their sunken cities.": "在收集和研究虚空力量的地球生物中，最主要的是Aboleth。这些古老的生物很久以前就发现了虚空之语，当时尼赫鲁人从遥远的流浪中回来。虚空语言构成了装饰他们的沉没城市的令人疯狂的石刻语言的基础。",
	"Wherever anyone utters void speech, no matter how well-meaning, darkness follows. Things from beyond hear the call and can follow its echo into existence. With sufficient study and practice, a speaker into the void can protect him or herself from the brunt of the horrors that arise and even turn deadly manifestations against foes. No amount of caution in using void speech and magic, however, can completely shield a practitioner from its corrupting nature. The void will have its due.": "无论在哪里，只要有人发表空洞的言论，无论多么善意，黑暗都会随之而来。来自外界的事物会听到召唤，并能跟随它的回声而存在。通过充分的学习和练习，一个说空话的人可以保护自己不受出现的恐怖的冲击，甚至把致命的表现转化为对敌人的伤害。然而，在使用虚空言语和魔法时，无论多么谨慎，都无法完全保护修行者免受其腐蚀。虚空会有它应得的。",
	"Void speech serves specific roles in the Midgard Campaign Setting. In the Western Wastes, massive, alien beings known to the inhabitants as Great Old Ones lumber across the blasted land. Dust goblins, selang, and aberrations scamper in the creatures' shadows and crawl over their twisted bodies in worship. These beings were originally called to Midgard from beyond the stars by void speech incantations. Their coming was a disaster that devastated the once fertile plains. Shamans and sorcerers among the twisted dust goblin tribes have puzzled out bits of void speech and wield the dark magic against their enemies.": "虚空之语在《米德加德竞选环境》中扮演着特殊的角色。在西部荒原，巨大的、被居民称为 \"伟大的老者 \"的外星生物在这块破碎的土地上蹒跚而行。尘土妖精、塞朗和畸形人在这些生物的阴影中窜来窜去，并在它们扭曲的身体上爬行以示崇拜。这些生物最初是通过虚无的语言咒语从星空之外被召唤到米德加德。他们的到来是一场灾难，破坏了曾经肥沃的平原。扭曲的尘土妖精部落中的巫师和巫师们已经解开了虚空之语的片段，并挥舞着黑暗魔法来对付他们的敌人。",
	"In the Southlands, void speech is most prevalent in the Abandoned Lands. The ramag are well aware of void speech and the horrors void magic can unleash. Their gatekeepers ruthlessly hunt down any rumor of void glyphs or speakers to cleanse that taint from the world. They struggle with unstable gateways and unpredictable magic, due in no small part to void magic.": "在南地，虚空之语在废弃之地最为盛行。拉玛格人很清楚虚空之语和虚空魔法所能释放的恐怖。他们的守门人无情地追捕任何关于虚空石刻或演讲者的传闻，以清除世界上的污点。他们与不稳定的门路和不可预测的魔法斗争，这在很大程度上是由于虚空魔法。",
	"It's no coincidence that in both locations, void speech exists in lands poisoned by magic gone awry and hostile to life.": "在这两个地方，空洞的语言存在于被魔法失控和对生命充满敌意的土地上，这并不是巧合。",
	"Void magic comprises a dangerous school of wizardry that exists alongside, but in the shadows of, the more well-known practices. This magic is anathema to existence itself, making it difficult to master and dangerous even to study. Dabblers rarely produce effects more profound than minor injury, property damage, and psychological scars to themselves and those around them. More serious investigations into void magic can spell disaster. Only alien creatures who psychology and physiology defy human understanding seem capable of commanding void magic with relative ease; even beings as anomalous as aboleths respect and fear the power of void magic.": "虚空魔法包括一个危险的魔法学派，它与更知名的做法并存，但处于其阴影之下。这种魔法与存在本身格格不入，使得它难以掌握，甚至研究起来也很危险。涉猎者很少产生比轻度伤害、财产损失和对自己及周围人造成的心理创伤更深刻的影响。对虚空魔法进行更认真的调查会带来灾难。只有那些心理学和生理学上违背人类理解的外星生物似乎才有能力相对轻松地指挥虚空魔法；即使是像亚博莱思这样的反常生物也会尊重和害怕虚空魔法的力量。",
	"Void magic spells can never be added to a wizard's spellbook as part of the two spells learned automatically for gaining a level (with the exception of void savants; {@class wizard|phb|see below|Void Speaker|DM03}). To learn a void magic spell, a wizard must find an NPC void speaker who's willing to impart the knowledge or discover the spell written as a spell scroll, in a captured spellbook, carved on a temple wall, or some other form of recorded lore. Alternatively, if the GM allows it, a character who sees and hears a void magic spell being cast can add it to his or her spell book, using the same rules as transcribing a spell from a scroll.": "虚空魔法的咒语永远不能作为获得等级后自动学习的两个咒语的一部分加入到魔法师的魔法书中（虚空大师除外；{@class wizard|phb|see below|Void Speaker|DM03}）。要学习一个虚空魔法，巫师必须找到一个愿意传授知识的NPC虚空演讲者，或者发现写在咒语卷轴上的咒语，在缴获的咒语书中，刻在寺庙墙上的咒语，或者其他形式的记录传说。另外，如果GM允许的话，看到和听到虚空魔法咒语的角色可以将其加入他或她的法术书中，使用的规则与从卷轴上抄写咒语相同。",
	"Despite void magic's strange origins, it still functions similarly to other arcane magic on a fundamental level. Void magic follows all the normal rules for spellcasting and is susceptible to dispelling, countermagic, and antimagic as normal. Void magic spells always have a verbal component and can't, under any circumstance, be cast without it.": "尽管虚空魔法的起源很奇怪，但它在基本层面上的功能与其他奥术魔法类似。虚空魔法遵循所有正常的施法规则，并且容易受到驱散、反魔法和反魔法的影响。虚空魔法的咒语总是有语言成分，在任何情况下都不能在没有语言的情况下施放。",
	"Under normal circumstances (or what passes for normal where void speech is concerned), only wizards can learn void magic. The following two feats make it possible for any character to channel the power of void speech in a limited way. At the GM's discretion, a wizard with a void magic feat may be able to learn void magic spells without finding them in written form, as if he or she was a void savant ({@class wizard|phb|see below|Void Speaker|DM03}).": "在正常情况下（或者说在涉及到虚空言语的情况下是正常的），只有巫师可以学习虚空魔法。以下两项特技使任何角色都有可能以有限的方式引导虚空语言的力量。根据GM的决定，拥有虚空魔法特技的巫师可以在没有找到书面形式的情况下学习虚空魔法咒语，就像他或她是个虚空专家一样（{@class wizard|phb|see below|Void Speaker|DM03}）。",
	"As an action, you can speak aloud a word or short phrase in void speech. One creature of your choice within 10 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against this magic (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "作为一个动作，你可以大声说一个单词或短语的空洞语言。在10英尺范围内，你选择的一个能听到你说话的生物必须对这个魔法进行智慧救赎（DC8+你的熟练度加成+你的魅力修饰），否则将在1分钟内受到你的%0%的影响。1%）的生物可以在它的回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对它的影响。",
	"Other creatures who can hear you suffer minor reactions to the void speech such as spontaneous nosebleeds, headaches, bits of hair falling out, and other unsettling effects. The first time you use this ability, you suffer no adverse effects. If you use it again before completing a short or long rest, you take {@dice 1d4} necrotic damage. Each additional time you use it before finishing a rest, the necrotic damage increases by {@dice 1d4}.": "其他能听到你说话的生物会对空洞的语言产生轻微的反应，如自发的流鼻血、头痛、头发掉落的碎片，以及其他令人不安的影响。在你第一次使用这个能力时，你不会受到任何不良影响。如果你在完成短期或长期休息之前再次使用它，你会受到（%0%）坏死性伤害。你在完成休息前每多使用一次，坏死的伤害就会增加（%1%）。",
	"As an action, you can use a writing medium to inscribe a magical void glyph on an unattended object within reach.

	"For the glyph to remain intact, you must concentrate on it as if concentrating on a spell. In addition to the normal demands of concentration, you must also make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of your turn or the glyph crumbles away and ceases to function.": "为了使石刻保持完整，你必须像专注于一个咒语一样专注于它。除了正常的集中注意力的要求外，你还必须在你的回合开始时成功地进行DC 10宪法救赎，否则石刻就会崩溃并停止运作。",

They attack your enemies and try to stay within 90 feet of you, but they control their own actions.

Others succumb to the madness and corruption that void magic touches and become living conduits for the horror seeking entry into the mortal world.": "一些虚空演讲者为了知识或抵御外面的东西而冒险进入黑暗。其他人则屈服于虚空魔法所带来的疯狂和腐败，成为寻求进入凡人世界的恐怖的活通道。",
	"Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a void spell into your spellbook is halved.": "从你在2级时选择这个传统开始，你必须花费一半的金币和时间来复制一个无效的法术到你的法术书中。",
	"When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn for gaining a level can be a void magic spell, even if you've never encountered the spell before. Similarly, when you learn a new cantrip, it can be a void magic cantrip, even if you've never previously encountered it.": "当你获得一个等级时，你为获得一个等级而学习的两个法术中的一个可以是虚空魔法法术，即使你之前从未遇到过该法术。同样地，当你学习一个新的咒语时，它可以是一个虚空魔法咒语，即使你之前从未遇到过它。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action immediately before you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can utter a few words of void speech and weave its dark magic into your spell. The tainted spell disorients one creature you can see that the spell affects when you cast it. The creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the start of your next turn. You can't use this feature if you are unable to speak.": "从2级开始，在你施放1级或以上的法术之前，作为一个额外的动作，你可以说出几句虚空之语，并将其黑暗魔法编织到你的法术中。被污染的法术会使你施法时能看到的一个受影响的生物失去活力。该生物在你下一回合开始前进行的下一次攻击卷或能力检查中处于劣势。如果你不能说话，你就不能使用这个功能。",
	"Beginning at 6th level, when you are damaged by a creature within 60 feet, you can use your reaction to bark a destructive word of void speech. If the creature can hear you, it takes necrotic damage equal to half your wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. You can't use this ability if you are unable to speak.": "从6级开始，当你被60英尺内的生物伤害时，你可以用你的反应叫出一个破坏性的虚空言语。如果该生物能听到你，它将受到相当于你的巫师等级的一半加上你的智力修饰的坏死伤害。你可以使用这个能力的次数等于你的智力修饰值（最小为1），当你完成一个长时间的休息后，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用次数。如果你无法说话，你就不能使用这个能力。",
	"Starting at 10th level, when you cast a void magic spell that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature. Additionally, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on void spells.": "从10级开始，当你施展只针对一个生物的虚空魔法时，你可以让它针对第二个生物。此外，你在保持对虚空法术的集中注意力时，在体质判定上有优势。",
	"At 14th level, you can use your action to pronounce a complicated phrase in void speech. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet. The area within 20 feet of that point is shrouded in dim light for one minute. Any creature hostile to you within the area is vulnerable to necrotic damage and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks. An affected creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes {@dice 3d6} necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC). Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You can't use this feature if you're unable to speak.": "在14级时，你可以用你的行动在虚空言语中念出一个复杂的句子。在60英尺内选择一个你能看到的点。该点20英尺范围内的区域被笼罩在昏暗的光线中，持续1分钟。在该区域内任何对你有敌意的生物都容易受到坏死的伤害，并且在智慧检查中处于不利地位。受影响的生物在该区域内开始其回合或在其回合内首次进入该区域时，会受到{@dice 3d6}坏死伤害，或在宪法救赎成功后受到一半伤害（使用你的法术救赎DC）。一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。如果你不能说话，你就不能使用这个功能。"
