	"Your innate magic stems from the mingling of your bloodline with the blood of a vampire. Some sorcerers with this origin can trace their powers back to an ancient bargain with a powerful vampire. When a vampire takes particular interest in a mortal being, they may allow that humanoid to have a taste of their blood, granting them a semblance of power. This ritual is seldom practiced, and few vampires would even dare to try it.

Shadows near a shadar-kai sometimes seem to reach out or deepen, especially when the shadar-kai is angry.": "Shadar-kai与人类相似，但在Shadowfell存在的重量将他们塑造成比人类同行略微矮小和瘦弱得多。沙达凯人有一种无色的肤色，从雪花石到深灰色不等。沙达凯人的头发同样是单调或乌黑的。苍白的头发可能有一丝在人类标准范围内的颜色。眼睛是有光泽的黑色，缺乏任何白色或清晰的瞳孔。靠近沙达凯的阴影有时似乎会伸出来或加深，特别是当沙达凯生气时。",
	"Although drab in natural appearance, shadar-kai are quite elaborate and idiosyncratic in personal adornment. They like dark and exotic clothing, jewelry, and weapons, often decorated with swatches of bright color. Hair is similarly ornate and often dyed, and many embellish their skin with tattoos, scars, and piercings.": "虽然自然外观单调，但Shadar-kai在个人装饰方面相当讲究和特立独行。他们喜欢深色和异国情调的服装、珠宝和武器，经常用鲜艳的色彩进行装饰。头发也同样华丽，而且经常染色，许多人用纹身、疤痕和穿孔来装饰他们的皮肤。",
	"The tattoos, scars, and piercings a shadar-kai wears have more than one purpose. They exist as a testament to the wearer's ability to withstand pain as well as a means of personal expression and decoration. Each decoration can also be a record of a deed done, an honor gained, or a misdeed declared.": "沙达凯人身上的纹身、伤疤和穿孔都有不止一个目的。它们的存在是为了证明佩戴者承受痛苦的能力，也是个人表达和装饰的手段。每一个装饰也可以是一个所做的事的记录，一个获得的荣誉，或一个宣布的错误行为。",
	"Through their pact with the {@deity The Raven Queen|DAPC|Raven Queen}, each shadar-kai is an instrument of death and fate. The Raven Queen doesn't demand worship from the shadar-kai, though she receives it in abundance. She demands only that they observe the pact by following her commandments. So most shadar-kai hold no pity for the dying and try to punish those who defy fate. But shadar-kai also believe that nobody truly knows what fate holds.": "通过他们与{@deity The Raven Queen|DAPC|Raven Queen}的契约，每个沙达凯都是死亡和命运的工具。乌鸦女王并不要求沙达凯的崇拜，尽管她得到了大量的崇拜。她只要求他们遵守契约，遵守她的戒律。因此，大多数Shadar-kai对濒临死亡的人不抱任何怜悯，并试图惩罚那些违抗命运的人。但Shadar-kai也相信，没有人真正知道命运会怎样。",
	"The Raven Queen is a fair mother, if not a loving one. When the shadar-kai called upon her in ancient times, she answered. She still does. While she spares little love, she also never demands the love of her children. Almost all shadar-kai revere the Raven Queen, but each shadar-kai is free to choose his or her destiny and way of life, including religion.": "乌鸦女王是一位公正的母亲，即使不是一位慈爱的母亲。当沙达凯人在远古时代呼唤她时，她回应了。她现在仍然如此。虽然她不怎么爱，但她也从不要求她的孩子们的爱。几乎所有的沙达凯人都崇敬乌鸦女王，但每个沙达凯人都可以自由选择他或她的命运和生活方式，包括宗教。",
	"The Shadowfell saps living creatures of creativity and the will to live. When shadar-kai moved to the Shadowfell ages ago, they were not immune to this depression. Numerous members of their early society gave in to ennui and simply slipped out of existence, driving the shadar-kai to change their lifestyle, embracing strong emotions and peak experiences. These practices, born out of necessity, became traditions over countless generations.": "暗影城剥夺了生物的创造力和生存意志。当Shadar-kai在很久以前搬到Shadowfell的时候，他们也不能幸免于这种压抑。他们早期社会的许多成员屈服于沮丧，干脆消失了，促使沙达凯人改变他们的生活方式，拥抱强烈的情感和高峰体验。这些出于需要的做法，在无数代人的努力下成为传统。",
	"The current culture of the shadar-kai is a study in pushing boundaries. Shadar-kai welcome difficult tasks and physical and emotional extremes as a way of life. They learn to channel the darkness of the Shadowfell rather than allowing that darkness to consume them. And they accept death as the inevitable end for those who fail to attain the right amount of power or fame.": "Shadar-kai目前的文化是一项关于挑战极限的研究。沙达凯人欢迎困难的任务以及身体和情感上的极端，以此作为一种生活方式。他们学会引导阴影地带的黑暗，而不是让这种黑暗吞噬他们。他们接受死亡是那些未能获得适当数量的权力或名声的人的必然结局。",
	"Shadar-kai embrace living with gusto. The limits of pleasure and pain distract them from the wearying melancholy of the Shadowfell. They also strive for personal greatness, so that if they fail to gain the ability to live forever, stories of their great deeds will grant a sort of immortality. In this search for personal glory, most shadar-kai ignore banalities such as comfort and safety.": "沙达凯人兴致勃勃地拥抱着生活。快乐和痛苦的极限分散了他们对暗影城令人疲惫的忧郁的注意力。他们还努力追求个人的伟大，因此，如果他们不能获得长生不老的能力，他们的伟大事迹的故事将赋予某种不朽的力量。在这种对个人荣耀的追求中，大多数沙达凯人忽视了舒适和安全等平凡的东西。",
	"Hidden within ancient tombs in vast deserts, mummies evoke fear in the heart of every adventurer. Raised by dark funerary rites through necromantic rituals, mummies unquestioningly serve the whims of their masters for as long as they live. However, once those masters are gone a rare few mummies may choose to stray from their ancient tasks, traveling out of their tombs to inflict themselves on the world above.": "木乃伊隐藏在广阔的沙漠中的古墓中，唤起了每个冒险者心中的恐惧。木乃伊是通过黑暗的葬礼仪式培养出来的，只要他们活着，就会毫不犹豫地为他们的主人的想法服务。然而，一旦这些主人离开了，极少数的木乃伊可能会选择偏离他们古老的任务，走出他们的坟墓，对上面的世界施加自己。",
	"An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.": "当死神或其他黑暗神灵的牧师对准备好的尸体施以亡灵魔法时，就会产生一个不死的木乃伊。在埋葬仪式结束前，木乃伊的亚麻布包装上会被刻上亡灵魔法的标记，并对黑暗进行召唤。当木乃伊不死时，它就会根据仪式规定的条件而活过来。最常见的是，对其坟墓、财物、土地或以前的亲人的侵犯会导致木乃伊复活。",
	"The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.": "伴随着木乃伊入土的漫长埋葬仪式，有助于保护其身体不被腐烂。在防腐过程中，新死的生物的器官被取出并放在特殊的罐子里，其尸体被用防腐油、草药和包裹物处理。尸体准备完毕后，通常用亚麻绷带包裹尸体。",
	"Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose. Once created, a mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors.": "一旦死亡，个人对其尸体是否被制成木乃伊没有发言权。有些木乃伊是有权有势的人，他们让大祭司或法老不高兴，或者犯了叛国、通奸或谋杀罪。作为惩罚，他们被诅咒永远不死，被防腐，被制成木乃伊，并被封存起来。其他时候，充当坟墓守护者的木乃伊是由被处死的奴隶创造的，专门为更大的目的服务。木乃伊一旦被创造出来，就会服从创造它的仪式所规定的条件和参数，只被驱使去惩罚违犯者。",
	"Most mummies have existed far longer than even the oldest elves, though most of them have remained in their tomb for nearly the entire period. Once they awake, they cannot remember their past life or personality, so they remain dry husks even throughout their eons of \"life\" if you could call it that.": "大多数木乃伊的存在时间甚至远远超过了最古老的精灵，尽管他们中的大多数几乎在整个时期内都呆在坟墓里。一旦他们醒来，他们就不能记得他们过去的生活或个性，所以即使在整个 \"生命 \"的年代里，他们仍然是干巴巴的躯壳，如果你可以这么说的话。",
	"However, some mummies do gain some knowledge of the outside world, and even the most rudimentary knowledge from when they were first created may hold untold secrets to the modern world. As a result, some serve as undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies away for occasional consultation, and particularly talkative mummies are treasured by historians.": "然而，一些木乃伊确实获得了一些关于外部世界的知识，即使是他们最初被创造时的最基本的知识，也可能对现代世界有着难以言喻的秘密。因此，有些木乃伊成为了失落传说的不死之身，创造他们的人的后代可以咨询。有权势的人有时会故意将木乃伊封存起来，以便偶尔进行咨询，而特别健谈的木乃伊则被历史学家所珍视。",
	"When they are created, mummies are not often named, and they have no memory of their name in life. Even when they are named, it is usually something extremely simple such as a number. However, once a mummy becomes free of its master, it might choose to give itself a real name, or perhaps let a troop of adventurers choose its name for it. Therefore, mummies can have all types of names based on what names they have encountered. If they have encountered many human adventurers in their time, they may choose a human name, and could do the same for any of the other races.": "当他们被创造出来时，木乃伊通常不会被命名，他们对自己生前的名字没有记忆。即使它们被命名，通常也是一些极其简单的东西，比如一个数字。然而，一旦木乃伊脱离了主人，它可能会选择给自己一个真正的名字，或者让一队冒险者为它选择名字。因此，木乃伊可以根据它们遇到过的名字，拥有各种类型的名字。如果它们在这段时间里遇到了许多人类冒险者，它们可能会选择一个人类的名字，对其他任何种族也可以这样做。",
	"The word \"wight\" meant \"person\" in days of yore, but the name now refers to evil undead who were once mortals driven by dark desire and great vanity. When death stills such a creature's heart and snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda.": "在过去的日子里，\"wight \"这个词的意思是 \"人\"，但现在这个名字指的是邪恶的亡灵，他们曾经是被黑暗欲望和巨大虚荣心驱使的凡人。当死亡扼杀了这种生物的心脏，扼杀了它的生命气息，它的灵魂就会向恶魔领主奥库斯或一些卑鄙的冥界之神呼喊，以获得缓刑：以不死换取对活人的永恒战争。如果黑暗势力回应了这一呼唤，它的灵魂就会获得不死之身，这样它就可以追求自己的邪恶议程。",
	"Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction.": "巫师拥有他们以前活着的自己的记忆和驱动力。他们会听从将他们转化为不死之身的任何黑暗实体的召唤，在保持自主性的同时，发誓要安抚他们的新主人。巫师永不疲倦，可以无休止地追求自己的目标，而不会分心。",
	"Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things. When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight's cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.": "巫师既不死也不活，存在于一个世界和另一个世界之间的过渡状态。它在生命中拥有的明亮的火花已经消失了，取而代之的是对吞噬所有生物的火花的渴望。当巫师发动攻击时，这种生命精华就像白热化的火苗一样在它的黑眼睛里发光，而巫师的冰冷触觉可以通过肉体、衣服和盔甲耗尽这种火花。",
	"Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places, surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and avoided by bird and beast.": "巫师们白天逃离世界，远离他们讨厌的太阳光。他们退缩到他们居住的荒冢、地窖和坟墓中。他们的巢穴是寂静、荒凉的地方，周围都是枯萎的植物，明显发黑，鸟兽都会避开。",
	"Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.": "被巫师杀死的人类可以在其控制下变成僵尸。在对活人灵魂的饥渴的驱使下，一些巫师在未死时被唤醒，成为邪恶领袖的突击队，包括巫妖。作为士兵，他们能够进行计划，但很少这样做，而是依靠他们对毁灭的饥渴来压倒站在他们面前的任何生物。",
	"When they are created, a wight keeps all of the memories of its former life, and therefore keeps its name as well. Therefore, wights can have all types of names based on whatever race they were in life.": "当他们被创造出来时，巫师会保留其前世的所有记忆，因此也会保留其名字。因此，巫师可以根据他们生前的种族，拥有各种类型的名字。",
	"A wall of writhing bones and skeletons springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of three 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). Any creature that starts its turn next to a wall must make a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} bludgeoning damage and become {@condition restrained}. The creature can make a Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking the same damage on a failure or freeing itself on a success.": "在你选择的范围内，一堵由蠕动的骨头和骷髅组成的墙涌现出来。这堵墙有6英寸厚，由三个10英尺乘10英尺的板块组成。每个板块必须至少与另一个板块相连接。如果这堵墙在出现时穿过了某个生物的空间，该生物就会被推到墙的一边（由你选择）。任何在墙边开始其回合的生物都必须做一个灵巧救赎动作，否则就会受到{@damage 1d8}重击伤害并变成{@condition restrained}。该生物可以在它的每个回合开始时做一个力量救赎，如果失败则受到同样的伤害，如果成功则释放自己。",
	"The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 10 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it.": "墙壁是一个可以被破坏的物体，因此可以被攻破。每块面板每英寸厚度有AC10和20个命中率。将一块面板的命中率降低到0，就会破坏它。",
	"You draw out a portion of your own blood as you kiss another humanoid. As you cast the spell, you must spend a number of hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it.

	"While in this form, the target has an AC of 18, its only method of movement is a walking and climbing speed of 20 feet, and it cannot jump or otherwise remove itself from the surface it moves on. This movement is completely noiseless, and allows the target to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down on ceilings. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. It has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, and is always hidden in darkness.

	"A rothorror is an undead monstrosity, reanimated by a unique species of maggot-like beasts. Indistinguishable from true maggots, these creatures are able to create rothorrors by infesting the body of a dead humanoid.

	"Legendary creations formed from shadow and poisonous gases, plaguebringers scour the most desolate areas of the shadowfell, spreading disease and malice through that barren wasteland.

A plaguebringer that finds itself in the material plane is a terrible foe indeed, capable of rivaling the power of the most ancient dragons. It flies across the surface of the world, killing all in its wake and spreading disease throughout the land. It is from these occasional visits that the plaguebringers earned their name.": "偶尔，plaguebringer在访问地表时也会发现一个通往物质界的入口。在物质界发现自己的plaguebringer确实是一个可怕的敌人，能够与最古老的龙的力量相媲美。它飞过世界的表面，在其身后杀死所有的人，并在整个土地上传播疾病。正是因为这些偶尔的拜访，Plaguebringers赢得了他们的名字。",

	"However, in the daylight a plaguebringer is extremely easy to spot: they look like a giant blob of darkness, after all. This means that any creature that wants to hunt a plaguebringer should do so during the day, when they can't simply vanish into night sky at a moment's notice.": "然而，在白天，plaguebringer非常容易被发现：毕竟他们看起来像一个巨大的黑暗圆球。这意味着任何想要猎杀食人魔的生物都应该在白天进行，因为它们不可能在一瞬间就消失在夜空中。",
	"As one of the few creatures capable of battling a plaguebringer, these creatures seek to hunt down and destroy dragons both in the Shadowfell and out of it.

	"In order to survive in the shadowfell, creatures must find a way to make do with whatever they find. One of the greatest adaptations of these creatures is their ability to eat any type of flesh - even the remains of an undead.

If they encounter a settlement, that settlement may disappear in a matter of days, or even a matter of hours, as plants overwhelm the buildings and roads.": "利用这个动画，被诅咒的橡树强行将健康的树木和植物连根拔起，诅咒它们，然后孕育出枯萎的荆棘、有毒的杂草和其他同类植物的生长。被诅咒的橡树走到哪里，这些被诅咒的植物就跟到哪里，以超自然的速度生长，吞噬它们所遇到的一切。如果它们遇到一个定居点，这个定居点可能会在几天内消失，甚至几小时内消失，因为植物压倒了建筑物和道路。",
	"All other blights are beneath the cursed oak in the chain of superiority. The cursed oak commands other blights, creating strategies and tactics far beyond the mind of your average blight.

	"The curse of Gulthias is powerful dark magic, and cannot be lifted by a remove curse alone. In order to lift the curse and restore the treant to its former self, the oak must first be knocked unconscious, such as through reducing its hit points to 0 without killing it outright. Once it is unconscious, another treant must perform an hour long ritual to lift the curse. If the ritual is interrupted, it must be restarted from the beginning.": "古尔蒂亚斯的诅咒是强大的黑暗魔法，不能仅仅通过消除诅咒来解除。为了解除诅咒并使树人恢复到以前的样子，橡树必须首先被击昏，例如通过将它的命中率降低到0而不直接杀死它。一旦它昏迷，另一个树人必须进行一个小时的仪式来解除诅咒。如果仪式被打断，它必须从头开始。",
	"Awakened from death by a vampire's bite, a cruorbeast serves as a loyal pet, protecting the vampire from harm and following its orders unquestioningly. Much like their undead masters, cruorbeasts do not cast shadows and abhor sunlight and running water.

	"While vampires usually do not bite non-humanoids, a special exception is made for giant bats. A relatively rare species, giant bats are highly sought after by upcoming vampires to become their servants. If one of these giant bats is slain by the vampire and then buried in the ground, it will rise the following night as a cruorbat under the vampire's control. These creatures are ravenous and bloodthirsty, much like the common vampire spawn that they accompany. Yet they manage to control their hunger at the request of their masters, only eating what is given to them - often the scraps of creatures killed by the vampire.": "虽然吸血鬼通常不咬非人类，但对巨型蝙蝠来说是一个特殊的例外。巨型蝙蝠是一种相对罕见的物种，被即将到来的吸血鬼高度追捧，成为他们的仆人。如果这些巨蝠中的一只被吸血鬼杀死，然后被埋在地下，那么它将在第二天晚上作为吸血鬼控制下的十字蝙蝠复活。这些生物贪婪而嗜血，就像它们所伴随的普通吸血鬼卵子一样。然而它们在主人的要求下设法控制自己的饥饿感，只吃给它们的东西--通常是被吸血鬼杀死的生物的残渣。",

If a vampire dies, then all of that vampire's cruorbeasts, with the exception of crour hulks, perish as well within the next 24 hours, since their master is the only meaning to their existence.": "每只十字兽都被创造它的吸血鬼所束缚，它们讨厌离开主人的身边--至少当它是一只十字兽或十字兽的时候。这些生物能够离开远足，使它们不能长时间地看到它们的主人，但它们更喜欢采取较短的飞行，使它们保持在距离吸血鬼巢穴几英里的范围内。如果一个吸血鬼死了，那么除了crour hulks之外，该吸血鬼的所有cruorbeasts也会在接下来的24小时内灭亡，因为它们的主人是它们存在的唯一意义。",
	"After they reawaken, cruorbeasts never sleep, remaining perpetually awake so that they may serve as constant watchdogs to their master. They sit on the balconies of their lair and in the treetops of the surrounding area, always looking out for potential intruders. If they spot any, they do not attack them. They instead opt to warn their master, waking them and alerting them to the intrusion. A cruorbeast will generally only attack if it has been ordered to by its master, in self-defense, or when severely underfed.": "苏醒后，十字兽从不睡觉，永远保持清醒，这样它们就可以作为主人的持续看门狗。它们坐在巢穴的阳台上和周围地区的树顶上，总是在寻找潜在的入侵者。如果它们发现任何入侵者，它们不会攻击他们。相反，它们会选择警告它们的主人，唤醒他们，提醒他们注意入侵者。一般来说，只有在主人的命令下，或在自卫时，或在食物严重不足时，十字兽才会攻击。",

Although these beasts look to be in ill health at first glance, the magic that runs through their veins makes them a powerful foe to face.": "血兽的形态是瘦弱的、腐朽的地狼，有着红色的皮毛和淡粉色的皮肤。虽然这些野兽乍看之下健康状况不佳，但流淌在它们血管中的魔法使它们成为面对的强大敌人。",
	"When a hyena feasts on a creature slain by a gnoll fang of Yeenoghu, that hyena undergoes a horrid transformation into a gnoll. However, there is also another lesser known, unintended transformation: the creation of bloodbeasts. When a dire wolf eats a creature that has been slain in that way, it instead undergoes a transformation into a bloodbeast, a creature imbued with the savagery and insatiable hunger of Yeenoghu himself. This process is extremely rare, since the territories of gnolls and dire wolves rarely intersect. But when they do, these powerful beasts can wreak havoc among the small packs of gnolls that dot the barren landscapes these beasts call home.": "当鬣狗吃了被叶诺古的地精獠牙杀死的生物后，那只鬣狗就会发生可怕的转变，变成一只地精。然而，还有另一种鲜为人知的意外转变：血兽的产生。当一只可怕的狼吃了一个以这种方式被杀死的生物，它反而会转变为一个血兽，一个被赋予野蛮和贪婪的Yeenoghu本身的生物。这个过程极其罕见，因为地精和地狼的领地很少交集。但当它们交汇时，这些强大的野兽可以在小群的地精中造成破坏，这些地精点缀着这些野兽称之为家园的贫瘠土地。",
	"When a bloodbeast is created, it quickly disappears from the scene of its creation and hides from the gnolls that accidentally brought it into existence. It is only after a few days that the beast is ready to venture out and search for its prey.

After becoming a blood beast, these creatures no longer have any desire to procreate or work in packs.": "当血兽被创造出来时，它很快就从创造的现场消失了，并躲藏起来，不让那些无意中把它带出来的地精们发现。只有在几天之后，血兽才准备好冒险出去寻找它的猎物。血兽在夜深人静的时候跟踪景观，寻找它们可以轻易伏击并迅速杀死的弱小生物。成为血兽后，这些生物不再有任何繁殖或成群结队的欲望。",
	"Larger groups of gnolls that see a bloodbeast will kill it on sight, knowing that these creatures can easily pick off all but the most powerful gnolls in one-on-one combat.": "较大的地精群体看到血兽会当场杀死，因为他们知道这些生物可以在一对一的战斗中轻易地干掉所有的人，除了最强大的地精。",
	"Archliches are beings of immense magical power outmatched by only the gods themselves. Through their many millennia of existence, archliches have mastered all arts of necromancy.

Long tired of the unending war, a few elves yearned to gain the power that would allow them end the war themselves. So these few became high mages, sages with unmatched magical power for their time. But they still needed more, as this war couldn't be ended with normal magic in the span of a single mortal life.": "Archliches是已知的最古老的生物，最初也只是在一万多年前的王室战争中产生的。对无休止的战争早已厌倦，一些精灵渴望获得能让他们自己结束战争的力量。所以这几个人成为了高级法师，在他们的时代拥有无与伦比的魔法力量的贤者。但他们仍然需要更多，因为这场战争不可能在一个凡人的一生中用普通的魔法来结束。",
	"So these mages devoted their entire lives to the study of necromancy, and learned the secrets to lichdom from their dealings with the dark gods of the time. These gods gave them the forbidden knowledge needed to ascend past even the most powerful liches, which hasn't been given to a mortal mind before or since. Using this knowledge, these mages began the arcane ritual. This ritual released a huge storm of necrotic power onto the world; an event now known as the Dark Disaster.": "所以这些法师把他们的一生都献给了死灵法术的研究，并从他们与当时的黑暗之神打交道的过程中了解了利希斯的秘密。这些神明给了他们所需的禁忌知识，以超越最强大的地衣，这在之前和之后都没有给过凡人的思想。利用这些知识，这些法师开始了神秘的仪式。这个仪式向世界释放了巨大的坏死力量的风暴；这个事件现在被称为黑暗灾难。",
	"The Dark Disaster destroyed an entire elvish kingdom, and reduced the surrounding area to a barren wasteland. This power also proved too much for the minds of the mages, and they lost all memory of their original purpose and their mortal life, but they had gained the power they had so desired.": "黑暗灾难摧毁了整个精灵王国，并使周围地区变成了一片荒芜的废墟。这种力量也证明对法师们的头脑来说太过沉重，他们失去了对自己最初目的和凡人生活的所有记忆，但他们却获得了他们所渴望的力量。",
	"Once the gods saw the destruction wrought by the Dark Disaster, they knew they needed to intervene. Celestial agents were sent to destroy these few archliches, but even the most powerful of angels couldn't fully destroy them. But eventually, after only a few months of destruction, all the archliches were banished to other planes, supposedly to never be seen again.": "一旦众神看到黑暗灾难所造成的破坏，他们就知道他们需要进行干预。天庭特工被派去摧毁这几个大恶魔，但即使是最强大的天使也无法完全摧毁他们。但最终，在仅仅几个月的破坏之后，所有的大恶魔都被放逐到其他星球，据说再也见不到了。",
	"After they were all dispatched, the gods sought to never allow another mortal to ascend to that degree of lichdom again. They used all their power to hide that forbidden knowledge, and even convinced some of the most evil deities to never to part with the knowledge.": "他们都被打发走后，诸神试图不再允许另一个凡人上升到那种程度的淫威。他们用所有的力量来隐藏这些被禁止的知识，甚至说服了一些最邪恶的神灵永远不要放弃这些知识。",
	"Although all the archliches were banished and trapped in their own demiplanes, a few of them have learned how to contact mortals in the material plane, though as of yet none have escaped the confines of their prison. By gaining mortal followers, an archlich hopes to free itself and become a ruler of the mortal world.": "虽然所有的大巫师都被放逐并被困在他们自己的半位面，但他们中的一些人已经学会了如何与物质界的凡人接触，尽管到目前为止还没有人逃出他们监狱的束缚。通过获得凡人的追随者，大酋长希望能释放自己，成为凡人世界的统治者。",
	"Those that are make a pact with an archlich are granted a degree of magical power, with the assumption that they will serve and put all their resources towards freeing their master. They believe that with the outside influence gained through these pacts, they will eventually find a creature capable of freeing them and inflicting them upon the world.": "那些与大酋长签订契约的人被授予一定程度的魔法力量，前提是他们将服务于并将所有的资源用于解放他们的主人。他们相信，通过这些契约获得的外部影响，他们最终会找到一个能够释放他们的生物，并将他们施加于这个世界。",
	"An archlich's phylactery is located within its demiplane, and is completely indestructible and inaccessible to all but the archlich. However, this means that if an archlich were to escape from their confines and then allow their body to be destroyed, they would once again be trapped within the demiplane when their body reforms.": "一个大法师的法器位于其半位面内，完全不可破坏，除了大法师之外，其他人都无法进入。然而，这意味着如果一个大巫师从他们的束缚中逃脱，然后让他们的身体被摧毁，当他们的身体被改造时，他们将再次被困在半位面中。",
	"Since an archlich requires the assistance of powerful spell casters to return to the material plane, it is necessary for them to attempt to create and hold allegiances with mortals. If a mortal was to learn how to summon an archlich from their plane of existence, the archlich would be obligated to keep that mortal alive and allied, for the archlich may need that mortal again if their body is destroyed and they are restored to their plane.": "由于大巫师需要强大的施法者的帮助才能回到物质界，所以他们有必要尝试与凡人建立和保持忠诚。如果一个凡人学会了如何从他们的存在界召唤大巫师，大巫师就有义务让这个凡人活着并与之结盟，因为如果他们的身体被毁，大巫师可能会再次需要这个凡人，并让他们恢复到他们的界。",
	"An archlich doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.": "弓箭手不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"If an archlich were to escape its prison, it would be able to create a lair for itself fairly quickly. Using the armies of undead it easily amasses, an archlich can build great castles and towers for itself, designing grand halls, mighty defenses, and cunning traps meant to ward off all intrusion.": "如果长老会逃出监狱，它就能很快为自己创造一个巢穴。利用它轻易聚集起来的亡灵大军，弓箭手可以为自己建造巨大的城堡和塔楼，设计宏伟的大厅、强大的防御系统和狡猾的陷阱，以抵御所有的入侵。",
	"An archlich's lair would be filled with strategically placed undead, meant to emerge and surround unlucky visitors. The lair would also include a residence for those that have made a pact with the archlich, both to keep those allies in good standing and to help protect the lair.": "大法官的巢穴中充满了战略性的亡灵，目的是为了让不幸运的访客出现并包围他们。巢穴还包括那些与大酋长达成协议的人的住所，以保持这些盟友的良好地位并帮助保护巢穴。",
	"An archlich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 31 (175,000 XP).": "在其巢穴中遇到的大酋长的挑战等级为31级（175,000XP）。",
	"The archlich rolls {@dice 2d8} and takes the higher roll, regaining a spell slot of the level rolled or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.": "弓箭手掷出{@dice 2d8}，采取较高的掷法，重新获得一个掷出的或更低等级的法术槽。如果它没有该级别或更低级别的已用法术槽，则不会发生任何事情。",
	"The archlich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.": "巫师的目标是它能看到的30英尺内的一个生物。一条噼里啪啦的负能量线将巫师与目标捆绑在一起。每当巫师受到伤害时，目标必须做一个DC20的宪法救赎动作。如果救赎失败，巫师会受到一半的伤害（四舍五入），而目标则会受到剩余的伤害。这种束缚会持续到下一回合的主动性计数20，或者直到巫师或目标不再在巫师的巢穴中。",
	"The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed for 1 minute and taking 52 ({@dice 15d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.": "巫师召唤出死在其巢穴中的生物的灵魂。这些幽灵会出现并攻击60英尺范围内巫师所能看到的一个生物。目标必须在DC20宪法救赎中成功，瘫痪1分钟，救赎失败时受到52{@dice 15d6}的坏死伤害，成功时受到一半的伤害。幽灵随后消失。瘫痪的生物可以在它的每个回合开始时重复这个蓄力动作，如果成功则结束效果。",
	"The slime moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Huge or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the slime enters a creature's space, the creature must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw.": "粘液的移动速度可以达到它的速度。在这样做的时候，它可以进入巨大或较小生物的空间。每当粘液进入一个生物的空间时，该生物必须做一个{@dc 16}灵巧的蓄力动作。",
	"Each non-undead creature within 60ft. of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages {@dice 1d4 * 10|1d4 x 10} years. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition frightened} condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a {@spell greater restoration} spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.": "在鬼魂60英尺范围内的每个非亡灵生物，如果能看到它，就必须成功地进行智慧救赎，否则就会在1分钟内变成{@condition frightened}。如果救赎失败5次或以上，目标也会衰老{@dice 1d4 * 10|1d4 x 10}年。一个{@condition frightened}的目标可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，在成功后结束对自己的{@condition frightened}条件。如果一个目标的自救成功或效果结束，该目标在接下来的24小时内对这个鬼魂的恐怖面孔免疫。衰老的效果可以用{@spell greater restoration}的法术逆转，但只能在它发生的24小时内逆转。",
	"The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.": "附身会持续到身体下降到0点，鬼魂以额外行动结束它，或者鬼魂被转化或被像{@spell dispel evil and good}法术一样的效果逼出来。当附身结束时，该鬼魂会重新出现在身体周围5英尺内的一个无人空间。目标在救赎成功后或附身结束后的24小时内，对这个鬼魂的附身有免疫力。",
	"Most fleshlings have pink, flesh colored skin, which is how they earned their name. Their features are completely monstrous, with serrated teeth, multiple pairs of eyes, sharp claws, and fleshy 'fins' on their back. They wear clothing made of hides and strong leathers, useful materials for protecting their skin against the harsh sun of the desert.": "大多数肉人的皮肤是粉红色的，肉色的，他们的名字就是这么来的。他们的特征完全是畸形的，有锯齿状的牙齿，多对眼睛，锋利的爪子，以及背上的肉质 \"鳍\"。他们穿的衣服是由兽皮和结实的皮革制成的，这些材料对保护他们的皮肤免受沙漠中刺眼的阳光照射很有用。",
	"Your type is both humanoid and undead, meaning you are affected by any features or abilities that affect either of those types. For example, you can be targeted by {@spell hold person} or turned by {@classFeature turn undead|Cleric||2}.
