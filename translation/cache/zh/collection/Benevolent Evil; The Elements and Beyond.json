	"This section provides a new mechanic called weakness along with a variety of other traits which can be added to any monster to customize it. These traits provide resistances, weaknesses, fun interactions, and environmental adaptations. Use these rules if you are looking for new ways to surprise your players with the same classic monsters or for ideas to use in a brand new monster of your own.": "这一部分提供了一个新的机制，叫做弱点，同时还有其他各种特性，可以添加到任何怪物身上来定制它。这些特性提供了抵抗力、弱点、有趣的互动和环境适应性。如果你正在寻找新的方法，用同样的经典怪物给你的玩家带来惊喜，或者寻找用于你自己的全新怪物的想法，请使用这些规则。",

	"Wth so many damage types found across he planes, you might want mechanics hat use damage types in interesting new ways beyond simple resistances and vulnerabilities. This section presents rules and options for customizing monsters. It provides the new weakness mechanic, along with new traits that can be added to monsters which make use of resistances and weaknesses to add damage-type-related depth and variety to combat. Many of these traits fit already existing monsters but are also not necessary for those who dislike how they play.": "由于在各个星球上发现了这么多的伤害类型，你可能想要在简单的抵抗和脆弱之外，以有趣的新方式使用伤害类型的机制。本节介绍了定制怪物的规则和选项。它提供了新的弱点机制，以及可以添加到怪物身上的新特性，这些特性利用抗性和弱点为战斗增加与伤害类型相关的深度和多样性。这些特性中有许多适合已经存在的怪物，但对于那些不喜欢它们的玩法的人来说也不是必须的。",
	"Some creatures and objects are quite easy to hurt with certain types of damage, but not as easily as those with vulnerability. These targets have weakness to those types of damage.": "有些生物和物体很容易被某些类型的伤害所伤害，但不像那些有弱点的生物和物体那样容易。这些目标对这些类型的伤害有弱点。",
	"Weakness is always associated with a damage type and a number. If a creature or object has weakness to a damage type and it takes more than 5 damage of that type at once, it takes extra damage of that type for each multiple of 5 in the damage that it took. The amount of extra damage is equal to its weakness number for that type. The damage caused by weakness cannot trigger additional damage from any weaknesses. Weakness is applied before all other modifiers to damage, including resistance and vulnerability.": "弱点总是与一个伤害类型和一个数字相关。如果一个生物或物体对某一伤害类型有弱点，而它一次承受了超过5个该类型的伤害，那么它承受的伤害中每一个5的倍数都会有该类型的额外伤害。额外伤害的数量等于它对该类型的弱点数量。由弱点造成的伤害不能触发任何弱点的额外伤害。虚弱在所有其他的伤害修改因素之前应用，包括抵抗和脆弱。",
	"For example, if a creature has \"weakness fire 2\" and it takes 13 fire damage from a spell, it also takes 4 extra damage, because there are two multiples of 5 in the 13 damage it took, so it takes 2 extra damage twice.": "例如，如果一个生物有 \"弱点火2\"，它从一个法术中受到13个火的伤害，它也会受到4个额外的伤害，因为在它受到的13个伤害中有两个5的倍数，所以它两次受到2个额外伤害。",
	"Any effect that affects vulnerability to a damage type also affects weakness to that damage type. For example, if an effect removes vulnerability to fire damage from a target, it would also remove any weakness to fire damage from that target.": "任何影响对某一伤害类型的脆弱性的效果也影响对该伤害类型的弱点。例如，如果一个效果消除了一个目标对火灾伤害的脆弱性，它也会消除该目标对火灾伤害的任何弱点。",
	"Some creatures have lived in extreme conditions for so long that they have adapted to them, becoming inured against certain damage types yet weak against others. For example, some kinds of polar bears are adapted to the most extreme of arctic conditions. Some snakes are adapted to the bright light and searing heat of the desert. As a DM, if you wish to add new themes and complexity to a monster, you can add one of these traits to represent its adaptation to the hazardous conditions it lives with. A DM can increase or decrease the levels of weakness that the trait provides to make the monster even more or less affected by the weakness.": "有些生物在极端条件下生活了很长时间，以至于它们已经适应了这些条件，变得对某些类型的损害免疫，但对其他类型的损害却很脆弱。例如，某些种类的北极熊适应于最极端的北极条件。有些蛇适应于沙漠的强光和灼热。作为DM，如果你想给怪物增加新的主题和复杂性，你可以增加这些特征中的一个，以代表它对危险条件的适应。管理员可以增加或减少该特性所提供的弱点等级，使怪物更多或更少地受到弱点的影响。",
	"The following traits are available. Adding one of these traits does not affect a creature's challenge rating.": "以下特征是可用的。添加这些特征之一并不影响一个生物的挑战等级。",

It has resistance to fire damage and radiant damage, but it has weakness 2 to necrotic damage.": "这种生物整天都在炽热的沙漠阳光下生活，它避开了阴凉处或冷却技术，但它对任何可能使它脱水或枯萎的东西都很弱。它对火灾伤害和辐射伤害有抵抗力，但对坏死性伤害的抵抗力为2。",

It has resistance to cold damage and fire damage, but it has weakness 2 to poison damage.": "这种生物具有怪异的生理结构，使它能够承受极端的温度，但它的身体过程更容易被毒素破坏。它对冷伤害和火伤害有抵抗力，但对毒伤害有弱点2。",

	"This creature is born of the most wretched of swamps, which has inured it to toxins and caustic water, but as the swamp rarely has storms it is weak to lightning. It has resistance to poison damage and acid damage, but it has weakness 2 to lightning damage.": "这种生物诞生于最可恶的沼泽地，这让它对毒素和腐蚀性的水感到厌恶，但由于沼泽地很少有风暴，它对雷电的抵抗力很弱。它对毒伤害和酸伤害有抵抗力，但对雷电伤害有弱点2。",
	"This creature is native to an extremely hot region filled with volcanic activity, toxic ash clouds, and even lava, but it doesn't handle the cold well. It has resistance to fire damage and poison damage, but it has weakness 2 to cold damage.": "这种生物原产于一个充满火山活动、有毒灰云、甚至熔岩的极热地区，但它不善于处理寒冷。它对火伤害和毒伤害有抵抗力，但对寒冷伤害有弱点2。",
	"Sometimes a creature is specially affected by a particular damage type but doesn't simply take extra damage from weakness or vulnerability. For example, a water elemental that takes cold damage is partially frozen, reducing its speed for a time. This section contains a variety of traits that a DM can add to a monster to impose penalties upon it when it takes damage of a certain type or encounters a certain type of substance or scenario.": "有时，一个生物会受到某种特定伤害类型的特别影响，但并不是简单地从弱点或脆弱性中获得额外伤害。例如，一个受到寒冷伤害的水元素会被部分冻结，在一段时间内降低其速度。本节包含各种特征，DM可以将这些特征添加到怪物身上，以便在它受到某种类型的伤害或遇到某种类型的物质或场景时对其进行惩处。",
	"The following traits are available. Adding one of these traits does not affect a creature's challenge rating, but it should still be done with an awareness of how the trait will affect the difficulty of combat with the creature, especially given the PCs that will be fighting. For example, adding a trait that is triggered by fire damage to a monster that will be fighting a Flame Dancer fighter will always make the fight against it much easier. However, it can also produce a fun and memorable encounter that rewards your players for the choices they made when leveling their characters.": "以下特征是可用的。添加这些特质之一并不影响生物的挑战等级，但在添加时仍应意识到该特质将如何影响与该生物战斗的难度，特别是考虑到将与之战斗的NPC。例如，给一个将与火焰舞者战斗的怪物添加一个由火焰伤害触发的特质，总是会使与它的战斗变得更加容易。然而，这也可以产生一个有趣的、令人难忘的遭遇，以奖励你的玩家在提升他们的角色等级时所做出的选择。",
	"The following traits are triggered by acid damage.": "以下特征会被酸液伤害所触发。",
	"This creature's body contains a substance that reacts explosively to strong acids. If it takes acid damage, it and each creature within 10 feet of it take fire damage equal to one-third of the acid damage dealt.": "这种生物的身体含有一种物质，对强酸会产生爆炸性的反应。如果它受到酸的伤害，它和它周围10英尺内的每个生物都会受到相当于所受酸伤害三分之一的火伤害。",
	"This creature is easily dissolved by acids, like a rust golem. If it takes acid damage greater than or equal to 10 + its challenge rating, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

	"The following additional boons are available. When a boon allows you to cast a spell, the spellcasting ability is your highest ability score.": "下列额外的恩赐是可用的。当一个恩赐允许你施法时，施法能力是你的最高能力得分。",
	"Boons presented in this chapter can be viewed in the {@filter Rewards|rewards|source=TEB} page.": "本章介绍的宝物可以在{@filter Rewards|rewards|source=TEB}页面查看。",
	"Some monsters and player character races in this compendium have multiple creature types, instead of only one. A creature with multiple types can be affected by a game effect if it works on any of the creature's types. This includes restrictions. For example, a creature that is both a fey and an undead cannot be affected by any effects that can't affect undead, even if it can affect fey.": "本简编中的一些怪物和玩家角色种族有多种生物类型，而不是只有一种。具有多种类型的生物可以受到游戏效果的影响，如果该效果对该生物的任何类型都有效。这包括限制。例如，一个既是费伊人又是亡灵的生物不能被任何不能影响亡灵的效果所影响，即使它能影响费伊人。",
	"If a game effect can't be adjudicated this way and you {@i must} treat the creature as one of its types, you should treat player characters as humanoids, and treat NPCs and monsters as the creature type listed in the normal position on their stat block, rather than the type or types named within their hybrid traits.": "如果一个游戏效果不能以这种方式判定，而你（%0%）将该生物视为其类型之一，你应该将玩家角色视为人形生物，并将NPC和怪物视为其状态块上正常位置所列的生物类型，而不是在其混合特征内命名的类型或类型。",
	"This compendium presents two new conditions to go along with those in the {@i Player's Handbook}—the new conditions {@condition ablaze|TEB} and {@condition buried|TEB}. If your DM desires, they can also make use of these new conditions in their own ways, such as when designing new monsters, spells, magic items, etc.": "本纲要提出了两个新的条件，与{@i Player's Handbook}中的条件相配合--新条件{@condition ablaze|TEB}和{@condition buried|TEB}。如果你的管理员愿意，他们也可以以自己的方式利用这些新条件，比如在设计新的怪物、法术、魔法物品时，等等。",
	"When a creature is on fire, either magical or nonmagical fire, it is ablaze. Ablaze is a new condition that unifies similar effects caused by some spells, monsters, and effects in not only this compendium, but in the officially published material as well. If a spell or effect describes lighting a creature on fire, lighting it ablaze, igniting it, or causing it to start burning, that creature is ablaze.": "当一个生物着火时，无论是魔法之火还是非魔法之火，它都会被烧毁。燃烧是一个新的条件，它统一了一些法术、怪物和效果造成的类似效果，不仅在本简编中，而且在正式出版的材料中也是如此。如果一个法术或效果描述了点燃一个生物、点燃它、点燃它或者导致它开始燃烧，那么这个生物就是燃烧。",
	"A creature that is ablaze will take {@dice 1d10} fire damage at the start of each of its turns, unless the effect that caused the flame specifies an amount of damage instead. Some effects, like the {@spell immolation|XGE} or {@spell searing smite} spells, cause a different amount of damage.": "一个被燃烧的生物在其每个回合开始时都会受到{@dice 1d10}的火焰伤害，除非造成火焰的效果指定了一个伤害量。有些效果，如{@spell immolation|XGE}或{@spell searing smite}的法术，会造成不同数量的伤害。",
	"Putting out the fire causing a creature to be ablaze varies in difficulty depending on what caused the fire. Nonmagical flame can be doused easily—a creature can take an action to douse the fire if the fire is within their reach, or if they have other means of dousing flame from further away, such as the {@spell control flames|XGE} spell. If the flame is submerged in water or a similarly smothering fluid, it is doused automatically.": "扑灭导致生物着火的火焰的难度取决于起火的原因。非魔法火焰可以很容易地被浇灭--如果火在他们伸手可及的范围内，或者如果他们有其他手段可以从更远的地方浇灭火焰，比如{@spell control flames|XGE}法术，那么生物可以采取行动来浇灭火。如果火焰被淹没在水中或类似的窒息液体中，它会被自动浇灭。",
	"Magical flame can be more difficult to douse, depending on the source. For example, the {@spell searing smite} spell can be doused as easily as any nonmagical fire but the flames from the {@spell immolation|XGE} spell can only be doused by ending the spell, either with a successful saving throw or an effect like {@spell dispel magic}.": "魔法火焰可能更难浇灭，这取决于火焰的来源。例如，{@spell searing smite}咒语可以像任何非魔法火焰一样容易被浇灭，但{@spell immolation|XGE}咒语的火焰只能通过结束咒语来浇灭，要么通过成功的蓄力或像{@spell dispel magic}的效果。",
	"When a creature is surrounded on all sides by a solid substance that it cannot move through, it is buried. Buried is a new condition caused by some spells, items, monsters, and effects in this compendium. At the DM's discretion, it can also be caused by certain natural events, such as being submerged in a landslide, cave-in, or avalanche, or by simply being buried alive.": "当一个生物四面都被固体物质所包围而无法移动时，它就被埋葬了。埋葬是由本简编中的一些法术、物品、怪物和效果引起的一种新状况。根据DM的判断，它也可以由某些自然事件引起，比如被淹没在山崩、塌方或雪崩中，或者只是被活埋。",
	"To be buried, a target must be trapped in a substance which is too solid to swim or fly through. Without a suitable substance to be buried in, a target cannot suffer from this condition. If a creature or object is only partially buried, it does not suffer from this condition.": "要被埋葬，目标必须被困在一种太坚固的物质中，无法游泳或飞行。如果没有合适的物质被埋葬，目标就不能受到这个条件的影响。如果一个生物或物体只是部分被埋，它就不会受到这个条件的影响。",
	"The substance it is buried in provides total cover from all directions. Unless the viewer can see through that substance, it also blocks line of sight. In addition, a buried creature suffers the following ailments while it remains buried:": "它所埋藏的物质从各个方向提供了完全的掩护。除非观察者能看穿该物质，否则它也会阻挡视线。此外，被埋葬的生物在被埋葬期间会受到下列疾病的困扰。",
	"It cannot use {@sense blindsight}, and it is {@condition deafened} unless it has {@sense tremorsense|MM}.": "它不能使用（%0%），它是（%1%），除非它有（%2%）。",
	"It is {@condition paralyzed}, except that it is not {@condition incapacitated}.": "它是（%0%），除了它不是（%1%）。",
	"It cannot breathe or provide somatic components for spells. If it normally needs to breathe, it can't speak or provide verbal components, it has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration, and it must hold its breath or suffocate.": "它不能呼吸或为法术提供身体成分。如果它通常需要呼吸，它就不能说话或提供语言成分，在为保持注意力而进行的拯救动作中处于劣势，而且它必须屏住呼吸或窒息。",
	"A creature cannot be buried in a substance that it can swim or burrow through. If a buried creature gains this capability after being buried, it immediately stops suffering from this condition. A creature is also immune to this condition if it is immune to any of the {@condition grappled}, {@condition restrained}, or {@condition paralyzed} conditions.": "一个生物不能被埋在它可以游泳或钻入的物质中。如果一个被埋葬的生物在被埋葬后获得了这种能力，它将立即停止受到这种状况的影响。如果一个生物对{@condition grappled}、{@condition restrained}或{@condition paralyzed}的任何条件免疫，它也会对这个条件免疫。",
	"Normally, specializing in poison damage can become problematic when encountering enemies that are immune to it. Most undead, elementals, and constructs are immune to poison damage, and many other creatures can be resistant or even immune to it. This makes poison damage weaker than the other damage types, which can feel bad for a player controlling a poison-focused character.": "通常情况下，当遇到对毒药免疫的敌人时，专攻毒药伤害会变得很麻烦。大多数亡灵、元素和构筑物都对毒药伤害免疫，许多其他生物对毒药伤害有抵抗力甚至免疫。这使得毒药伤害比其他伤害类型更弱，这对控制毒药重点角色的玩家来说可能感觉很糟糕。",
	"However, your DM may use this optional rule to balance out the utility of poison damage in a world with so much immunity. When using this rule, beasts and humanoids who have a Constitution score of 8 or lower automatically have vulnerability to poison damage on account of their fragile bodily health. This does not apply this to player characters.": "然而，你的管理员可以使用这一可选的规则来平衡毒药伤害在一个具有如此多免疫力的世界中的效用。当使用这条规则时，体质分数为8或更低的野兽和人形生物，由于其脆弱的身体健康，会自动对毒药伤害有脆弱性。这并不适用于玩家角色。",
	"Spell Prowess is a new feature for spellcasters. If you have spell prowess with a spell, you gain a bonus to the damage rolls of that spell equal to half your proficiency bonus.": "法术能力是施法者的一个新特征。如果你对某一法术拥有法术能力，你会在该法术的伤害卷中获得相当于你熟练度加成一半的加成。",
	"In addition, when you attempt to cast a spell at a spell level equal to or less than two-thirds of your proficiency bonus and you have spell prowess with that spell, you can choose one component (somatic, verbal, or material) to ignore for that casting of the spell.": "此外，当你试图施放一个法术等级等于或低于你熟练度加成三分之二的法术时，并且你对该法术有法术神通，你可以选择一个成分（体质、语言或物质）来忽略该次施法。",
	"You can't use this rule to ignore components that are consumed or are worth more than 10gp, and you can't use this rule to make a spell require no components.": "你不能使用这个规则来忽略那些被消耗掉的或价值超过10gp的组件，你也不能使用这个规则来使一个法术不需要组件。",
	"Some of the feats and class features in this compendium contain references to specific spell lists which contain spells from the {@i Player's Handbook}, {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}, {@i Tasha's Cauldron of Everything}, and from the new spells section of this compendium.

Many ash genasi also smell of smoke and burnt hair at all times.": "灰烬精灵的肤色从近乎炭黑到苍白，几乎是骨白的颜色，几乎一直是片状和灰白色。他们的头发通常是暗红色或橙色，秃头在他们中很常见。一些罕见的灰烬族人有烟熏火燎的火焰，这些火焰从来没有长的很长或很浓，而不是头发。许多灰烬族人在任何时候都有烟味和头发烧焦的味道。",

	"As an ice genasi, you have manifested both air and water, connecting you with the enduring dual-element of ice, water that has been robbed of its heat. You are nearly emotionless, except when pushed to anger or grief, which you feel very rarely and only in the worst of situations.": "作为一个冰族人，你同时体现了空气和水，将你与持久的冰的双重元素联系起来，水被剥夺了它的热量。你几乎是没有感情的，除了被逼到愤怒或悲伤的时候，你很少有这种感觉，只有在最糟糕的情况下才有。",
	"Ice genasi have pale skin made out of a fragile, flexible crystal, usually a cloudy white or bluish-white, but sometimes a vibrant blue-black color instead. They are a bit larger than humans on average and cold to the touch, often developing condensation water upon their skin just by existing.

Ice genasi have blue eyes, but they vary in shades from nearly white to deep indigo.": "冰族人有苍白的皮肤，由脆弱而有弹性的水晶制成，通常是浑浊的白色或蓝白色，但有时也有鲜艳的蓝黑色。他们平均比人类大一点，触摸起来很冷，常常因为存在而在皮肤上形成凝结水。许多冰族人有蓝色、黑色或白色的头发，通常质地非常柔软和细密，但也有一些人从头上长出坚硬的晶体，而不是头发，他们身上没有任何地方有头发。冰族人的眼睛是蓝色的，但它们的颜色从接近白色到深靛蓝色不等。",

	"As a storm genasi, you have manifested both air and fire, connecting you with the intense dual-element of lightning, the sky's fire.

	"Storm genasi have skin of deep blue or sometimes shades of bluish purple or grey.

Storm genasi have loud, resonating voices that boom like thunder when they are upset or excited.": "暴风女的皮肤是深蓝色的，有时是蓝紫色或灰色的色调。他们的头发通常是深色的，但有时也可能是鲜明的白色，由于他们的身体一直充斥着静电，所以头发总是竖立着。暴风女有响亮的共鸣声，当他们不高兴或兴奋时，声音会像雷声一样轰鸣。",

	"You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. Instead of sleeping, you must spend at least four hours in a meditative state. Your consciousness becomes divided between your body and the distant Mother Crystal that you split from, which some part of your mind never truly left. Though you are distracted, you remain aware of your surroundings. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.": "你不需要睡觉，魔法也不能让你睡觉。与其说是睡觉，不如说你必须在冥想状态下度过至少四个小时。你的意识在你的身体和你分裂出来的遥远的母晶之间变得分裂，你的思想的某些部分从未真正离开。虽然你心不在焉，但你仍然意识到你周围的环境。以这种方式休息后，你获得了与人类8小时睡眠相同的好处。",

Even mundane things such as clouds in the sky, the flight of birds, or creatures growing old are usually fascinating to a shardmind when first encountered.": "大多数Shardmds在逻辑上和情感上都很遥远，从一个异次元旅行者的外星视角看待世界。即使是平凡的事物，如天空中的云，鸟类的飞行，或生物的老去，在第一次遇到时，通常也会让利智者着迷。",
	"Because they do not age and come from a nearly timeless realm, shardminds also tend to adopt a longterm perspective on things. The day-to-day concerns of creatures that must eat and worry of aging are often mysterious to shardminds, even after spending much time with the other races. Some are eager to learn more of the strange world they find themselves in, yet others are more aloof, never forgetting the alien realm they call home or their quest for purpose.": "因为他们不会衰老，而且来自一个几乎永恒的领域，沙民也倾向于对事物采取长期的观点。即使在与其他种族相处了很长时间之后，鲨鱼管理人对那些必须进食的生物的日常关注和对衰老的担忧往往是神秘的。有些人渴望了解更多他们发现自己所处的陌生世界，但有些人则比较冷漠，从未忘记他们称之为家的异域或他们对目标的追求。",
	"The coloration of a shardmind's crystal body comes from their position as part of the Mother Crystal. Because most of the Mother Crystal is a reddish-pink color resembling ruby or rose quartz, most shardminds are made of similar crystal. But the Mother Crystal is made of all colors of opaque crystal, and thus so is the population of shardminds.": "锐敏的水晶体的颜色来自于他们作为水晶之母的一部分的位置。因为母晶的大部分是红粉色，类似于红宝石或玫瑰石英，所以大多数沙民都是由类似的水晶制成。但水晶之母是由各种颜色的不透明水晶组成的，因此，沙民的数量也是如此。",
	"When a shardmind dies, their mind and soul are pulled back to the Mother Crystal, once again becoming one with the whole from which they separated. Most shardminds view this as a process that should not be rushed, since they were likely split off for a reason. But there are exceptions who seek to return their fellow shardminds to the Mother Crystal (by deadly force if necessary) in order to empower it with their life force. Those shardminds typically have an evil alignment.": "当一个沙民死亡时，他们的思想和灵魂会被拉回母晶，再次与他们所分离的整体融为一体。大多数沙民认为这是一个不应操之过急的过程，因为他们被分离出来可能是有原因的。但也有例外，他们试图将他们的沙民同伴送回水晶之母（必要时可使用致命的武力），以便用他们的生命力赋予它力量。这些沙民通常有一个邪恶的取向。",
	"You have two creature types: humanoid and celestial. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.": "你有两种生物类型：人形和天体。如果一个游戏效果对你的任何一种生物类型起作用，你就能受到它的影响。",

	"Glasshearts have had the alien inclinations of their original form exposed to celestial light, cleansing their crystal of impurities and aligning their mind and body with celestial grace and spirit. They have lost their connection to the Mother Crystal, but they have gained in its place an open heart and a sense of duty to the free souls of the world, becoming more like the celestials they live with. With time, they even forget the language of the Far Realm they once belonged to, Deep Speech, in favor of the Celestial language.": "玻璃心的原始形态的外在倾向被暴露在天体的光线下，清洗了他们水晶中的杂质，使他们的思想和身体与天体的优雅和精神保持一致。他们失去了与水晶之母的联系，但他们获得了一颗开放的心和对世界自由灵魂的责任感，变得更像与他们一起生活的天人。随着时间的推移，他们甚至忘记了他们曾经属于的远界的语言--深层语言，而选择了天人的语言。",
	"Surprisingly, most crystalkin without the connection to the Mother Crystal, such as glasshearts, find that they must rest their mind entirely on their own. In other words, glasshearts discover that—as a creature of mind without the connection to the Mother Crystal—they can sleep. In fact, they must sleep as regularly as any other creature, or mental fatigue will bring them difficulty moving their crystalline bodies.": "令人惊讶的是，大多数没有与水晶之母联系的水晶人，如玻璃心，发现他们必须完全靠自己来休息自己的心灵。换句话说，玻璃心发现，作为一个没有与水晶之母联系的心灵生物，他们可以睡觉。事实上，他们必须像其他生物一样定期睡觉，否则精神疲劳会给他们的水晶体带来活动困难。",
	"Most glasshearts, unlike shardminds, are not very emotionally distant or especially logical, and instead tend to be passionate and sociable. Their tendency to adopt a long-term perspective manifests as a fascination with the culture, law, philosophy, religion, and history of the other free-willed races (who are commonly regarded with xenophilic wonder by the glasshearts) Many of them journey to the Material Plane simply to meet the varied people who live there and, if they're lucky, find a way to improve the world.": "大多数玻璃心的人，与锐敏人不同，在感情上不是很疏远，也不是特别有逻辑性，而是倾向于充满激情和善于交际。他们采取长期观点的倾向表现为对其他自由意志种族的文化、法律、哲学、宗教和历史的迷恋（玻璃心的人通常对这些种族抱有异样的好奇心）。",
	"Regardless of the color crystal a glassheart was once made of, they have been rendered translucent (nearly transparent) and their crystal color has faded to a faint whisper. Their crystal body resembles glass or diamond. It is clear enough that light can pass through it, but images viewed through their bodies are made distorted and unrecognizable by a kaleidoscopic effect. Some glasshearts even produce a prismatic rainbow effect when light shines through their body.": "无论玻璃心曾经是由哪种颜色的水晶制成的，它们都已经变成了半透明的（近乎透明），其水晶颜色已经褪去，变成了微弱的耳语。他们的水晶体类似于玻璃或钻石。它足够清晰，光线可以穿过它，但通过它们的身体观看的图像会因万花筒效应而变得扭曲和无法辨认。一些玻璃心的人甚至在光照过他们的身体时产生棱镜彩虹效应。",
	"When a glassheart dies, because they are no longer connected to the Mother Crystal, their mind and soul undergo the same processes that any other humanoid faces upon death, potentially being judged by the same celestials and divinities who they once lived around.": "当一个玻璃心人死亡时，由于他们不再与水晶之母相连，他们的思想和灵魂会经历与其他人形生物死亡时相同的过程，可能会被他们曾经生活在周围的天人和神灵审判。",
	"You know the {@spell druidcraft} and {@spell dancing lights} cantrips. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell sleep} spell once, and it recharges after a long rest.

	"Pixies are the archetypal fairy—they are shy, yet curious and often vain, usually appearing only to the strangers who they believe to be good-hearted and worthy enough. They seek praise from outsiders for their appearance and for the tiny costumes they fashion from whatever they can find, but they also want to learn more of the other races. Pixie adventurers are often much less shy than their fellows, which pushes them to pursue their curiosity and seek out new friends to play with. Once they're out in the wide world, they often make excellent adventurers, even if their ever-shifting curiosity makes them easily distracted and their distaste for weapons and violence make many roles off-putting.": "小精灵是典型的仙女--他们害羞，但又充满好奇心，而且往往很虚荣，通常只出现在他们认为心地善良、足够有价值的陌生人面前。他们因自己的外表和用任何能找到的东西制作的小服装而寻求外人的赞美，但他们也想更多地了解其他种族。小精灵冒险家往往比他们的伙伴们更不害羞，这促使他们追求自己的好奇心，寻找新朋友一起玩耍。一旦他们来到广阔的世界，他们往往会成为优秀的冒险家，即使他们不断变化的好奇心使他们很容易分心，而且他们对武器和暴力的厌恶使许多角色变得令人讨厌。",
	"Pixies have appealing features and are often thought to be quite attractive if imagined at human size. They commonly have fantastical skin and hair colors, such as bright green, ocean blue, and even stranger shades. Most pixies pride themselves on taking care of their appearance, always ensuring that their hair and clothing is well-styled and fashionable. They adopt the dress and mannerisms of other races and cultures that they find fancy, accepting each custom with equal dignity.": "小精灵有吸引人的特征，如果按照人类的大小来想象，通常被认为是相当有吸引力的。他们通常有梦幻般的皮肤和头发颜色，如明亮的绿色、海洋的蓝色，甚至还有更奇怪的色调。大多数小精灵以照顾自己的外表为荣，总是确保他们的头发和衣服是精心设计和时尚的。他们采用他们发现的其他种族和文化的服饰和举止，以同样的尊严接受每一种习俗。",
	"Pixies are incurably playful and whimsical, even in dangerous situations. Most pixies play their pranks so that both the pixie and their target can have a laugh at the end. If the prank leaves the target feeling worse than they did before, the prank is probably too cruel for most pixies to enjoy—unless the target is a particularly mean individual. After all, despite their friendly nature, most pixies just can't stand bullies!": "小精灵是不折不扣的顽皮和异想天开，即使是在危险的情况下。大多数小精灵的恶作剧是为了让小精灵和他们的目标在结束时都能笑一笑。如果恶作剧让目标人物感觉比以前更糟糕，那么这个恶作剧对大多数小精灵来说可能太残酷了，除非目标人物是一个特别卑鄙的人。毕竟，尽管他们天性友好，但大多数小精灵都无法忍受欺负他们的人。",
	"In some worlds, pixies are the only kind of fairy, but in most worlds they coexist with sprites and at times even with scamps. In worlds where fey are divided between the seelie and unseelie, the tiny pixies are almost always counted among the seelie fey.": "在某些世界里，小精灵是唯一的一种仙女，但在大多数世界里，它们与精灵共存，有时甚至与scamps共存。在精灵分为精怪和非精怪的世界中，小精灵几乎总是被算作精怪中的一员。",
	"You can use your action to touch a creature and magically learn its current emotional state.

Sprites don't usually have skin colors much different than humans do, and unlike the wings of pixies or scamps, sprite wings always resemble the austere wings of a dragonfly.": "作为自我任命的荒野守护者，精灵并不像小精灵那样以俏皮或友好著称。这些精灵以其在面对更大威胁时的勇敢而闻名，也以其文化所教导的严厉和坚忍而闻名。他们很少玩恶作剧或搞奇思妙想，一般来说，他们更愿意为未来的冲突保持准备。魍魉的皮肤颜色通常与人类没有太大区别，而且与小精灵或scamps的翅膀不同，魍魉的翅膀总是像蜻蜓的朴素的翅膀。",
	"Sprite society is organized around their duty to guard. They establish their settlements in places of unspoiled nature or primal magic, and sometimes even in sacred groves or abandoned fey ruins. They form squads and patrol the area around their village, guarding the place from those who would despoil nature and fending off intruders so their presence is not discovered. The rest of the village lives their humble lives to aid and support the squads, keeping the hidden village running. Most sprites are driven by a reliable sense of moral duty, encouraged from a young age by their communal culture.": "雪人的社会是围绕着他们的职责而组织的，即守护。他们在未受破坏的自然环境或原始魔法的地方建立自己的定居点，有时甚至在神圣的树林或被遗弃的精灵遗迹中。他们组成小队，在村子周围巡逻，保护这个地方不被那些破坏自然的人破坏，抵御入侵者，以免他们的存在被发现。村子里的其他人过着他们卑微的生活，帮助和支持这些小队，维持这个隐蔽的村庄的运转。大多数精灵被一种可靠的道德责任感所驱使，他们从小就受到社区文化的鼓励。",
	"When possible, sprites prefer to lure interlopers away from the locations they guard using deception instead of warding them off with the overt threat of violence.

Sprites who become adventurers usually carry these guerrilla tactics with them, applying them wherever fitting.": "在可能的情况下，精灵们更愿意用欺骗的方式将入侵者引离他们所守卫的地点，而不是用暴力的威胁来驱赶他们。他们的武器上涂有罕见的精灵制造的毒素，可以让敌人沉睡，使精灵小队能够把他们带到别的地方，在那里，入侵者醒来后会相信这次遭遇不过是一场梦。成为冒险家的精灵们通常会带着这些游击战术，在合适的地方运用它们。",

	"In some worlds, the race of corvians were once a faction of kenku who were against the betrayal of their master. Fearful of their master's wrath, they sought protection by betraying their fellow kenku and warning their master of the plot, helping to seal the fate of the kenku race. Their vengeful master was partially mollified by their loyalty, but in wrath still saw them as kenku and cursed them with a lesser curse. The corvians kept their voice and their wings, but both their minds and bodies became twisted and warped. They too were cast out by the master not long after the kenku, and they have never forgotten how little \"trust\" is worth.": "在一些世界里，科维安人曾经是反对背叛主人的肯库人的一个派别。由于害怕主人的愤怒，他们通过背叛同伴寻求保护，并向主人警告了这一阴谋，帮助封杀了肯库族的命运。他们复仇的主人因他们的忠诚而得到部分抚慰，但在愤怒中仍将他们视为肯库人，并以较低的诅咒来诅咒他们。科维安人保留了他们的声音和翅膀，但他们的思想和身体都变得扭曲和变形了。在Kenku之后不久，他们也被主人赶了出去，他们从未忘记 \"信任 \"是多么的不值钱。",

	"And there are also worlds where corvians were a race of divine servants for the Raven Queen long ago, flying from her domain to the planes beyond on the Dread Wind to deliver the messages of death herself. But the Raven Queen's enemies arranged to frame her loyal messengers as traitors. When the ruse was successful, the goddess of death, in her rage, banished the corvians to the Material Plane, twisting their bodies and casting them down from the sky to walk upon the ground. These corvians have never forgotten their betrayal, and believe that the Lady Death is ready to finish her judgment and strike them dead at any moment.": "还有一些世界，科维人在很久以前是乌鸦女王的神仆种族，他们乘着恐惧之风从她的领地飞往其他星球，亲自传递死亡的信息。但乌鸦女王的敌人安排将她忠诚的信使陷害为叛徒。当诡计得逞后，死亡女神在愤怒中把科维人放逐到物质界，扭曲他们的身体，把他们从天上扔下来，在地上行走。这些科维人从未忘记他们的背叛，并相信死亡女神已经准备好完成她的审判，随时将他们击毙。",
	"At first glance, a corvian appears to be a warped combination of a kenku and an aarakocra. The tall lanky birdpeople most closely resemble crows and ravens, but they often have crooked spines, cracked beaks, missing feathers, and other signs of age. Adult corvians have only a few years before these signs of apparent age take hold, meaning that even corvians in the prime of their life often look ancient and elderly to other races. Corvians can usually distinguish true elders of their own race from the younger members with ease, but other races often struggle to do so.": "乍一看，科维安人似乎是肯库人和阿拉科拉人的扭曲组合。这种高大瘦弱的鸟人最像乌鸦和乌鸦，但它们往往有弯曲的脊柱、破裂的喙、缺失的羽毛和其他年龄的痕迹。成年的柯维人在这些明显的年龄迹象出现之前只有几年的时间，这意味着即使是正值壮年的柯维人在其他种族看来也往往是古老而苍老的。科威亚人通常可以轻松地将自己种族的真正长者与年轻成员区分开来，但其他种族往往很难做到这一点。",
	"Corvians do not have separate wings like aarakocra do. Instead, their wings have fused with their long arms, hanging off the upper limbs like a short cloak. Their hands and feet are tipped with razor-sharp talons, and their beaks are long and hooked slightly downward like a vulture's beak. Corvians have black feathers with a blue or purple sheen, and their eyes are blue, yellow, red, or sometimes entirely black. Their skin, which can often be seen under the patches of missing feathers, is usually a pale pink or purple.": "科威亚人不像阿拉科拉那样有独立的翅膀。相反，它们的翅膀已经与它们的长臂融合，像一件短斗篷一样挂在上肢。它们的手和脚都带有锋利的爪子，它们的喙很长，像秃鹰的喙一样略微向下钩。科威亚人的黑色羽毛带有蓝色或紫色的光泽，它们的眼睛是蓝色、黄色、红色，有时是全黑。它们的皮肤通常是淡粉色或紫色的，在缺失的羽毛斑块下可以看到。",
	"If you see a corvian crane their head to one side and listen at nothing in particular, then bristle with a new emotion such as fear or confidence, that corvian was likely listening to a force they call the Dread Wind. It is a spectral wind that blows not through air, but through the dreams and fears of living things - that is at least according to the corvian philosophers, who are divided upon its true origin or purpose in the world. None can actually do any more than speculate, however.": "如果你看到一个科里安人把头扭向一边，什么也不听，然后又有了一种新的情绪，如恐惧或自信，那么这个科里安人很可能在听一种他们称之为 \"恐惧之风 \"的力量。这是一种幽灵般的风，它不是通过空气吹来的，而是通过生物的梦想和恐惧来吹来的--至少根据科里安哲学家的说法，他们对它在这个世界上的真正起源或目的存在分歧。然而，除了猜测，没有人能够真正做到这一点。",
	"The corvians claim that—for whatever reason—only corvians (and their ancient enemies) can hear the Dread Wind, and that it carries not dust, clouds, or seeds, but intangible things, such as fears, memories, whispers, names, secrets, and other knowledge. Many corvians even believe the Wind can carry dark curses, arcane mysteries, or visions of the future to those who listen carefully and closely.": "科维人声称，不管是什么原因，只有科维人（和他们古老的敌人）能听到恐惧之风，而且它携带的不是灰尘、云彩或种子，而是无形的东西，如恐惧、记忆、耳语、名字、秘密和其他知识。许多科尔维人甚至相信，风可以携带黑暗的诅咒、神秘的奥秘，或者对那些仔细聆听的人来说是未来的幻觉。",
	"Corvians listen to the Dread Wind largely to stay aware of possible threats to themselves and the things they care about, hoping to hear whispers within the Wind of their adversaries' movements before they are undone. Corvians also fear their own secrets being released upon the Wind for others to hear, and will take great pains to prevent careless exposure. The Wind does not blow within the home of a living creature, so corvians have some safe places to whisper their secrets to only the most trusted of friends.": "科尔维人倾听 \"恐惧之风 \"主要是为了保持对自己和自己关心的事物的可能威胁，希望在他们被解救之前听到风中关于对手动向的低语。科维人也担心自己的秘密被风中的人听到，所以会费尽心思防止不小心暴露。风不会吹到生物的家里，所以科维人有一些安全的地方，只对最信任的朋友说他们的秘密。",
	"While other races may speculate as to whether the Dread Wind actually exists, and whether these sounds are hallucinations or not, the corvians are certain of the Dread Wind's existence and terrifying importance, and most will stop to listen to it if they can before making any weighty decisions.": "虽然其他种族可能会猜测恐惧之风是否真的存在，以及这些声音是否是幻觉，但科威亚人确信恐惧之风的存在和可怕的重要性，如果可以的话，大多数人会在做出任何重要决定之前停下来听一听。",
	"Corvians have an impeccable memory. They easily remember details even from decades prior, and they remember images and sounds in perfect clarity, enabling them to quickly memorize entire pages of information with only a few glances.": "科维安人拥有无可挑剔的记忆力。他们很容易记住甚至是几十年前的细节，他们能完美清晰地记住图像和声音，使他们只需看几眼就能迅速记住整页的信息。",
	"Because of this, corvian society highly values the retention of knowledge, especially of history. Wide areas are dedicated to libraries and museums, and scribes, scholars, and archaeologists are revered as the noblest of vocations. Corvians are fascinated by histories of all kinds, not just of their own race, and so their scholars often seek out knowledge from the great libraries and academies of other societies—yet their paranoia and general wariness of outsiders usually compel them to keep these pilgrimages clandestine.": "正因为如此，科维亚社会高度重视知识的保留，尤其是历史知识。广泛的区域被用于图书馆和博物馆，文士、学者和考古学家被推崇为最崇高的职业。科维安人对各种历史都很着迷，不仅仅是他们自己的种族，因此他们的学者经常从其他社会的大图书馆和学院中寻找知识--但他们的偏执和对外人的普遍戒心通常迫使他们保持这些朝圣之旅的秘密性。",
	"But the keen corvian memory has a darker side. Most corvians are quick to form grudges against those they believe to have slighted them, and commonly take pride in never forgetting these grudges. Even the smallest of offenses can be cataloged in a corvian's memory for decades, ready and waiting for the proper moment to take recompense.": "但敏锐的科威亚人的记忆力也有黑暗的一面。大多数科威亚人很快就会对那些他们认为轻视他们的人形成怨恨，并且通常以永不忘记这些怨恨为荣。即使是最小的冒犯，也能在科威亚人的记忆中记录几十年，准备并等待适当的时机进行报复。",
	"Corvians attempt to pay each grudge back in equal measure to the weight of the offense, but corvian morality doesn't always align with that of the other races, especially in regard to the keeping of secrets. Breaking a corvian's trust and sharing even the smallest of a corvian's secrets is one of the worst things you can do to most corvians—even worse than attacking them. Most will never forget or forgive it. Their culture teaches that there is no worse crime.": "科威亚人试图以同等的分量来回报每一次的怨恨，但科威亚人的道德观并不总是与其他种族一致，尤其是在保守秘密方面。破坏科威亚人的信任和分享科威亚人最小的秘密是你能对大多数科威亚人做的最糟糕的事情之一，甚至比攻击他们更糟糕。大多数人将永远不会忘记或原谅它。他们的文化告诉我们，没有比这更糟糕的罪行了。",
	"Corvian names are usually based on the Aarakocra language, with variations emerging from the corvian histories, and they go by nicknames around other races much like aarakocra do. Unlike aarakocra, however, corvians have a powerful cultural superstition about their true names, fearing that the Dread Wind listens for their names whenever they are not safely within a home, carrying the true names of hapless or reckless corvians to the ears of their ancient enemies to be used against them in foul curses.": "科维安人的名字通常基于阿拉科克拉语，并在科维安人的历史中出现了一些变化，他们在其他种族中也会像阿拉科克拉人那样使用昵称。然而，与阿拉科克拉不同的是，科维安人对自己的真名有一种强大的文化迷信，他们担心只要不在家里安全地呆着，可怕的风就会倾听他们的名字，把那些无能或鲁莽的科维安人的真名带到他们古老敌人的耳边，在肮脏的诅咒中用来对付他们。",
	"Because the corvians are so concerned with keeping their true names a secret, they usually go by a nickname that is unrelated to their true name. Of course their true name is often so riddled with bird sounds like shrieks, trills, and clicking that it is unpronounceable by most of the other races anyways.": "由于科威亚人非常注重对自己的真名保密，所以他们通常使用与真名无关的绰号。当然，他们的真名往往充满了鸟类的声音，如尖叫声、颤音和咔嚓声，以至于其他大多数种族无论如何都无法读出。",
	"For a corvian, the act of sharing their true name with another person is not only intended as an act of honor and respect, but also an expression of intense trust and friendship. Corvians generally prefer if this act of name disclosure is mutual, but it is considered extremely uncouth (not to mention unwise) to give one's true name with the expectation of reciprocation. In corvian society, giving away your true name is a gift, not a transaction, and must be done humbly.": "对于科维安人来说，与另一个人分享他们的真实姓名的行为不仅是一种荣誉和尊重，也是一种强烈信任和友谊的表达。科维安人通常更喜欢这种透露姓名的行为，但在期望得到回报的情况下给出自己的真名被认为是极其不礼貌的（更不用说是不明智的）。在科威亚社会，泄露你的真名是一种礼物，而不是交易，而且必须谦虚地进行。",

This crystal barrier, which was created by the gods and known by such names as the Deep Night's Curtain, the Living Gate, and the Warden of Infinity, was partially destroyed during an ancient, cosmic war. What remained of the bulwark was the Mother Crystal, and it still yearns to regain its former power, retake its former place at the edge of the void, and once again seal off the Far Realm from the universe entirely.": "在一些世界中，母水晶曾经是远界和星界之间的一个跨维度堡垒，它阻止了反常的入侵者，如心魔、星体产卵者和上古邪神的入侵。这个由众神创造的水晶屏障，被称为 \"深夜之幕\"、\"生命之门 \"和 \"无限的守护者\"，在一场古老的宇宙战争中被部分摧毁。这道壁垒剩下的是水晶之母，它仍然渴望恢复它以前的力量，重新夺回它以前在虚空边缘的位置，并再次将远界与宇宙完全隔离。",

	"And there are worlds where ancient cosmic entities—perhaps old gods or mages of titanic power—combined their magic to create a transcendent archspell, a magic that sought to recreate the universe itself as whatever the casters intended. But the magic was imperfect, and the spell instead condensed into a crystalline entity from the Far Realm with its own mind: the Mother Crystal. Some say it fled from its creators into the Astral Plane. Others say it was exiled there by those same creators.

They have eyes made of faintly glowing crystal set into their faces, with dots of focused light that dart around like pupils as they focus on things. This strange light is hidden when they are in darkness, and does not illuminate the crystalkin's surroundings. They do not have ears, but they can hear just as well as the other races.": "水晶人有头有脸，通常有一个类似鼻子的形状，但他们没有鼻孔或嘴巴，因为他们不吃、不喝、不呼吸。他们有一双由微弱发光的水晶制成的眼睛，镶嵌在他们的脸上，当他们专注于事物时，有一些聚焦的光点，像瞳孔一样四处飞舞。当他们处于黑暗中时，这种奇怪的光被隐藏起来，不会照亮水晶人的周围环境。他们没有耳朵，但他们和其他种族一样能听到。",
	"Crystalkin can be small and thin like slivers, with no outgrowths of crystal anywhere upon them altering their smooth humanoid form. Others can be larger, be more jagged, or have outgrowths of especially rough crystals, particularly around the outsides of their joints, such as elbows, knees, hips, or shoulders. Some have larger growths of crystal sprouting out of the tops of their heads, where a human might have hair, but they still do not grow as real hair does.": "水晶人可以是小而薄的，就像切片一样，他们身上没有任何地方长出水晶，改变了他们光滑的人形外形。其他的水晶人可以更大，更有锯齿状，或者有特别粗糙的水晶长出，特别是在他们的关节外侧，如肘部、膝盖、臀部或肩膀。有些人的头顶上长出了更大的水晶，在人类可能有头发的地方，但它们仍然不像真正的头发那样生长。",
	"Crystalkin are almost never quite symmetrical across any part of their body, and most find the extreme bodily symmetry among the other races to be at least a bit strange, if not downright creepy.": "水晶人的身体任何部分几乎都不太对称，大多数人认为其他种族的极端身体对称性至少有点奇怪，如果不是完全令人毛骨悚然的话。",
	"Though once part of a greater mind, each crystalkin is still nonetheless an individual with a soul, mind, and personality of its own. At first, crystalkin still retain a tenuous mental connection, like an invisible thread, with the distant Mother Crystal. The majority of these crystalkin, which are called shardminds, stay within the Astral Plane their entire lives. Some eventually find their way to the other planes and live there for a time, seeking a purpose. While they can't speak with the Mother Crystal directly, they can still feel its soothing psychic presence, which helps them center their mind and focus on the world around them.": "虽然曾经是一个更大的思想的一部分，但每个水晶体仍然是一个独立的个体，有自己的灵魂、思想和个性。起初，水晶体仍然与遥远的水晶之母保持着脆弱的精神联系，就像一条无形的线。这些被称为shardminds的大多数水晶体，一生都呆在星界内。有些人最终找到了去其他星球的路，并在那里生活了一段时间，寻求一种目的。虽然他们不能直接与水晶之母对话，但他们仍然可以感受到水晶之母舒缓的精神存在，这有助于他们集中精神，专注于周围的世界。",
	"Many of those journey to the Upper Planes, where other ageless crystalkin have built small cities. They spend extended time in the celestial planes, where they are transformed by positive energy into translucent crystalkin called glasshearts, losing their connection to the Mother Crystal but gaining an affinity for celestials and divine magic. Glasshearts are no longer soothed by the Mother Crystal, but the celestial light that they have been infused with soothes them in its place.": "其中许多人前往上层世界，在那里其他不老的水晶体建立了小型城市。他们在天界度过漫长的时间，在那里他们被正能量转化为半透明的水晶体，称为玻璃心，失去了与水晶之母的联系，但获得了对天人和神圣魔法的亲和力。玻璃心不再受到水晶之母的抚慰，但他们被注入的天体之光会代替水晶之母抚慰他们。",
	"Some crystalkin become lost in other planes such as the elemental planes, Mechanus, or even the Nine Hells. These crystalkin can, like the glasshearts, lose their connection to the Mother Crystal, but unlike the glasshearts they are not filled with a new astral energy. Legends describe some of the lost crystalkin becoming void creatures, like star spawn. Other tales speak of crystalkin that became little more than mindless elementals, or of crystalkin that, in their emptiness, bargained with fiends for purpose and power, and in the process became fiends themselves.": "有些水晶体迷失在其他位面，如元素位面、麦格纳斯，甚至是九层地狱。这些水晶体可以像玻璃心一样，失去与水晶母体的联系，但与玻璃心不同的是，他们不会被新的星界能量所填充。传说中，一些失去联系的水晶体变成了虚空生物，就像星辰之卵。其他的传说中，水晶精变成了无意识的元素，或者水晶精在他们的空虚中，为了目的和力量与魔族讨价还价，在这个过程中，他们自己也变成了魔族。",
	"Whether the Mother Crystal intends so many of its spawn to become disconnected and transformed by the magic of the planes in this way is a matter of some debate among not only crystalkin, but those who study them as well. Some suspect the Mother Crystal has great plans for all these crystalkin scattered across the planes... but what could the purpose possibly be?": "水晶之母是否有意让它的这么多卵子以这种方式与各星球的魔力脱节和转化，不仅在水晶体之间，而且在那些研究它们的人之间也有一些争议。有些人怀疑水晶之母对散落在各星球上的所有这些水晶体有伟大的计划......但目的可能是什么？",
	"Since crystalkin don't reproduce or have gender (unless they choose to have one) they aren't given names, and they don't categorize names based on gender. Crystalkin typically adopt a name some time after separation from the Mother Crystal.": "由于水晶人不会繁殖，也没有性别（除非他们选择有性别），所以他们没有被赋予名字，也不会根据性别对名字进行分类。水晶体通常在与水晶母体分离后的一段时间内采用一个名字。",
	"Shardminds choose a name based on the ancient name of the Mother Crystal, which is so long and complex that speaking it in full—even at a rushed pace—takes many hours. Shardmind names are fragments of the Mother Crystal's full name, chosen based on that crystalkin's original position in the Mother Crystal's eternal lattice structure.": "沙门的名字是根据古老的水晶之母的名字来选择的，这个名字是如此之长和复杂，以至于说完整个名字--即使是以匆忙的速度--也需要很多小时。沙门的名字是水晶之母全名的片段，根据水晶之母永恒的晶格结构中的原始位置来选择。",
	"Glasshearts often choose a new name some time after they have been fully purified. Glassheart names usually represent a concept or ideal that is personally meaningful to them.": "玻璃心经常在他们完全净化后的一段时间内选择一个新的名字。玻璃心的名字通常代表一个对他们个人有意义的概念或理想。",
	"Amata, Arshaka, Arwia, Balashi, Bashanu, Belessunu, Cyrila, Dipana, Erishti, Eshunu, Gelem, Hunzu, Iltani, Ishmea, Jinali, Kuaya, Kubaba, Kuri, Manishtu, Naram, Nuraya, Seluku, Tebu, Tabni, Ubashu, Utua, Zakiti": "Amata, Arshaka, Arwia, Balashi, Bashanu, Belessunu, Cyrila, Dipana, Erishti, Eshunu, Gelem, Hunzu, Iltani, Ishmea, Jinali, Kuaya, Kubaba, Kuri, Manishtu, Naram, Nuraya, Seluku, Tebu, Tabni, Ubashu, Utua, Zakiti",

	"Most crystalkin are wizards, clerics, sorcerers, and warlocks. Wizardry comes easily to shardminds, as the esoteric workings of arcane magic are not too different from the enigmas of the Mother Crystal. And as shards of a magic being, crystalkin sorcerers can draw on that magic power. Shardminds usually have an Aberrant or Wild Magic origin, while glasshearts are born to be Divine sorcerers, and both subraces make excellent Cosmic sorcerers.": "大多数水晶人是巫师、牧师、巫师和术士。巫术对水晶人来说很容易，因为奥术魔法的深奥运作与水晶之母的谜团没有太大区别。而作为一个魔法生物的碎片，水晶人的巫师可以利用这种魔法力量。Shardminds通常有一个异端或野性魔法的起源，而玻璃心生来就是神性巫师，这两个子种族都是优秀的宇宙巫师。",
	"Shardminds often draw clerical power from the Astral Plane and the Mother Crystal as either the Arcana, Knowledge, Light, or Madness (from {@i The lmpermissicon}) domains, but they rarely adopt the ideals required to become paladins. Glasshearts can be commonly found as clerics following almost any good deity, owing to their celestial affinity, and take easily to the tenets of paladin oaths.": "Shardminds经常从星界和母水晶中汲取神职力量，作为阿卡纳、知识、光明或疯狂（来自（%0%））领域，但他们很少采用成为圣骑士所需的理想。由于他们的天体亲和力，玻璃心通常可以被发现为追随几乎所有善神的神职人员，并且很容易接受圣骑士誓言的信条。",
	"Shardmind warlocks almost always use the Great Old One patron for the Mother Crystal, and rarely make pacts with any other entity. Glasshearts often make pacts with Celestials or Archfey.": "锐敏术士几乎总是使用伟大的老者作为水晶之母的守护者，很少与任何其他实体订立契约。玻璃心术士经常与天神或大法师签订契约。",
	"Crystalkin druids and rangers are incredibly rare. The vast majority of crystal kin see the natural world as something strange and foreign, although some glasshearts in places like Arcadia, Elysium, Arborea, and other outer planes touched by nature may have learned from the celestials of nature gods.": "水晶族的德鲁伊和游侠是非常罕见的。绝大多数水晶族人把自然界看成是陌生的东西，尽管在阿卡迪亚、极乐世界、阿波瑞亚等地方的一些玻璃心，以及其他被自然界触及的外部星球，可能已经从自然神的天人那里学到了知识。",
	"Artificers aren't uncommon among shardminds, but the practicality of being an artificer instead of a wizard only appeals to those shardminds who have spent much time in the Material Plane.": "工匠在巫师中并不少见，但成为工匠而不是巫师的实用性只对那些在物质界呆了很久的巫师有吸引力。",
	"Crystalkin almost never become classes that lack magic, like barbarian, rogue, or fighter. Crystal kin monks are also rare, but some pursue that path out of a love for meditation and inner peace.": "水晶人几乎从不成为缺乏魔法的阶级，如野蛮人、无赖或战士。水晶族的僧侣也很罕见，但有些人出于对冥想和内心平静的热爱而追求这一道路。",
	"Tonight, at dinner, the creature actually climbed into a chair and—before anyone could say anything—grabbed a fork and started trying to use it. It's been barely a day and a half since we first fished this thing up, but it watches. It's learning from us. Of course it doesn't know everything yet. It was trying to use the fork like a spoon to eat soup!": "今晚，在吃饭的时候，这个怪物居然爬到了椅子上，在大家还没来得及说什么的时候，抓起一把叉子，开始尝试使用它。从我们第一次把这东西捞上来到现在还不到一天半的时间，但它在观察。它在向我们学习。当然，它还不知道一切。它试图把叉子当做勺子来吃汤！它还在尝试使用叉子。",
	"I've been real unsure about the decision to Jet the thing stay loose, but I don't want to kill it, and it's not like we can keep it locked up! Some of the crew got upset tonight about it eating our food, asking me if I really thought we could trust it. Before I could say much of anything, the creature actually spoke! In a bird-like voice it said 'We are friends.'": "我对让这东西保持松散的决定一直很不确定，但我不想杀死它，而且我们也不可能把它锁起来！\"。一些船员今晚对它吃我们的食物感到不安，问我是否真的认为我们可以信任它。我还没来得及说什么，那个生物就真的说话了！它用一种类似于鸟的声音说：\"我知道你在说什么。它用一种类似鸟的声音说：\"我们是朋友。",
	"I think this weird octopus-thing might actually be the smartest person on this ship.": "我认为这个奇怪的章鱼东西实际上可能是这艘船上最聪明的人。",
	"There are dark parts of the ocean: the deep chasms and reefs where even tritons and merfolk hesitate to go. The octopus-like deeplings are the mysterious inhabitants of these places, but you will be hard-pressed to find one if they don't wish to be found. With a talent for disguise and camouflage, the deeplings live strange lives without culture or organized society, acting more like wild animals than humanoids. Despite this, they have a uniquely clever intellect, and they carry a streak of incurable curiosity that drives them to explore further and further, learning more and more about the world as they study and experiment with anything and everything they can get their tentacles on.": "海洋中有一些黑暗的地方：深沟和暗礁，甚至连三爪鱼和人鱼都不敢去。像章鱼一样的深海鱼是这些地方的神秘居民，但如果它们不愿意被发现，你很难找到它们。由于具有伪装和伪装的天赋，深海鱼过着奇怪的生活，没有文化或有组织的社会，他们的行为更像野生动物而不是人类。尽管如此，他们有独特的聪明才智，他们带着不可救药的好奇心，驱使他们不断探索，在研究和实验任何他们能接触到的东西时，对世界了解得越来越多。",
	"Most deeplings never leave the dark depths they were born in, living their entire existence as a wild person. But sometimes curiosity leads a deepling into the light or even onto land, where they might encounter other humanoid races. When they first emerge from the watery depths and make contact with another race, many deeplings are excited to learn that the world is wider than they ever imagined, full of wonders and mysteries to be understood, and eagerly devour the new information all around them.": "大多数深海生物从未离开过他们出生的黑暗深渊，他们的整个生命都是作为一个野生的人。但有时好奇心会把深海生物引向光明，甚至引向陆地，在那里他们可能会遇到其他类人种族。当他们第一次从水的深处出来，与另一个种族接触时，许多深海生物兴奋地了解到世界比他们想象的要宽广，充满了有待理解的奇迹和神秘，并急切地吞噬着他们周围的新信息。",
	"In some worlds, when gods were still using the krakens for war, they created the race of deeplings and gave them to the krakens as servitors to worship and tend to the aquatic monstrosities. When the krakens broke free of the gods after their wars ended, the krakens cast the deeplings—who they saw as spies for the gods—out to live on their own in the dark seas.": "在一些世界里，当诸神还在利用克拉肯人进行战争时，他们创造了深海人这个种族，并把他们交给克拉肯人作为仆人来崇拜和照顾这些水生怪兽。当战争结束后，克拉肯人挣脱了诸神的束缚，克拉肯人把深海人--他们认为是诸神的间谍--赶到黑暗的海洋中独自生活。",
	"In other worlds, deeplings are most closely related to aboleths. The two races lived in the same primordial waters before the coming of the gods who cast down the aboleth empire. Deeplings were among the first slaves dominated by the aboleths' psychic abilities and were favored for their versatility as aquatic workers. When the aboleths lost their empire, the deeplings escaped to live as free individuals.": "在其他世界，deeplings与aboleth的关系最为密切。这两个种族在众神到来之前生活在同一个原始水域，众神推翻了阿波勒斯帝国。Deeplings是第一批被aboleths的精神能力所支配的奴隶，并因其作为水生工人的多功能性而受到青睐。当aboleths失去他们的帝国时，深海鱼人逃出，作为自由人生活。",
	"And there are worlds where fey of the deep, dark waters created the deeplings to act as their faithful guardians by ensorcelling octopuses into humanoid form and granting them extreme intelligence—which the deeplings used to escape their fey masters and emigrate to the Material Plane.": "还有一些世界，深邃黑暗的水域中的精灵创造了深灵，作为他们忠实的守护者，将章鱼附身为人形，并赋予它们极度的智慧--深灵利用这些智慧逃离它们的精灵主人，移居到物质世界。",
	"The true appearance of a deepling is a rare sight even for its companions. The deepling body resembles a large octopus with a more humanoid head. Just like an octopus, a deepling has no bones - its small beak is the only hardened part of its body. They each have eight tentacles, two of which are extra dexterous and are used as main hands. They don't have a brain, and their ability to think is distributed across their entire body. Because of this, their tentacles sometimes move on their own, and most deeplings that travel on land keep them bound together under clothing to conceal them and prevent them from wandering where they shouldn't.": "deepling的真正外观即使对它的同伴来说也是罕见的。deepling的身体类似于一只大章鱼，头部更像人。就像章鱼一样，deepling没有骨头--它的小嘴是其身体唯一坚硬的部分。他们每个人都有八个触角，其中两个特别灵巧，被用作主要的手。它们没有大脑，它们的思考能力分布在整个身体上。正因为如此，它们的触手有时会自行移动，大多数在陆地上旅行的深海鱼将它们捆绑在一起，放在衣服里，以掩盖它们，防止它们在不该去的地方徘徊。",
	"Deeplings have skin that actually appears as a spotted blue, grey, green, or pink, but they have the ability to change their skin's color at-will, even choosing different colors and patterns for different body parts. They can even use this ability to make their smooth skin into a different texture, such as a texture like that of rocks, coral, scales, or short fur. Their strange octopus-like eyes, which are usually yellow, green, or blue, however, can't be disguised in this way.": "深海鱼的皮肤实际上呈现为斑斓的蓝色、灰色、绿色或粉红色，但它们有能力随意改变皮肤的颜色，甚至为不同的身体部位选择不同的颜色和图案。它们甚至可以利用这种能力使自己光滑的皮肤变成不同的质地，比如像岩石、珊瑚、鳞片或短毛的质地。然而，他们奇怪的章鱼一样的眼睛，通常是黄色、绿色或蓝色，却不能用这种方式来伪装。",
	"Most adult deeplings that live with other races spend their time imitating that race or another race that has gained their fancy. By twisting their many tentacles into shapes across their malleable body, they can closely imitate the body shape, skin, and even some of the facial features of other humanoids. They coil four or more tentacles into the shape of legs and walk awkwardly upon them, using their remaining tentacles to form the upper body. Deeplings often wear bulky clothing and other elements of nonmagical disguise to complete the facade for day-to-day ease.": "大多数与其他种族生活在一起的成年深海鱼都会花时间模仿那个种族或另一个获得他们青睐的种族。通过将他们的许多触手在其可塑性强的身体上扭曲成各种形状，他们可以密切模仿其他人类的身体形状、皮肤，甚至一些面部特征。它们将四条或更多的触手卷成腿的形状，在上面笨拙地行走，用剩余的触手组成上半身。深海人经常穿着笨重的衣服和其他非魔法伪装的元素，以完成日常生活中的装束。",
	"Despite taking these efforts to hide their true nature, deeplings rarely manage to avoid standing out in a crowd, either because of the strange dress they use to disguise themselves, the odd face that can never be perfectly disguised, or the alien behavior resulting from their lonely upbringing. It is common for a deepling to be unable to truly pass as the race they are disguised as, but such a disguise does still hide the deepling's true appearance from the world.": "尽管采取了这些努力来隐藏他们的真实本性，深林人很少能够避免在人群中脱颖而出，这是因为他们用奇怪的衣服来伪装自己，奇怪的面孔永远无法完美地伪装，或者由于他们孤独的成长环境导致的异类行为。深林人无法真正伪装成他们所伪装的种族是很常见的，但这样的伪装仍能将深林人的真实面貌隐藏起来。",
	"Deeplings have a unique form of reproduction that generally prevents them from forming a stable culture or society. When two deeplings choose to reproduce, the choice is final. Their bodies fuse and transform into a massive egg which, when carried on an ocean current, bursts into hundreds of smaller eggs that scatter across the ocean. After six months, the eggs release hundreds of baby deeplings, each no larger than a man's fist. The deeplings swim away into the dark seas without any parents or kin—all alone.": "深海生物有一种独特的繁殖方式，通常使它们无法形成一个稳定的文化或社会。当两个深海生物选择繁殖时，这个选择是最终的。它们的身体融合并转化为一个巨大的蛋，当被洋流带入时，会爆裂成数百个较小的蛋，散落在海洋中。6个月后，这些卵释放出数百个小深海鱼，每个都不比人的拳头大。深海鱼在没有任何父母或亲属的情况下，独自游向黑暗的大海。",
	"This is how a deepling's life almost always begins. They swim about in the darkness with no guide or knowledge, unaware of where they came from or what they are. They are small at first, and live as animals, hunting and foraging for food on instinct, and using the same instincts to flee from the many aquatic predators that would devour them.": "这就是深海鱼的生活几乎总是这样开始的。他们在黑暗中游来游去，没有向导或知识，不知道自己从哪里来，也不知道自己是什么。他们起初很小，像动物一样生活，凭着本能狩猎和觅食，并利用同样的本能逃离许多会吞噬他们的水生捕食者。",
	"Despite growing at a rapid rate and maturing within only two years, most deeplings never make it to adulthood. The ones that survive rely on their keen intellect and ravenous curiosity to learn about the world in absence of a parent or community to teach them—what is safe to eat, where to find shelter, how to escape or fight off a hungry shark, etc. Young deeplings are most threatened by sahuagin, who consider the rubbery meat of any deepling to be a delicacy.": "尽管生长速度很快，而且在短短两年内就成熟了，但大多数深海鱼从来没有达到成年的程度。活下来的深海鱼依靠它们敏锐的智力和贪婪的好奇心，在没有父母或社区的教导下了解这个世界--什么是安全的食物，在哪里找到住所，如何逃离或击退饥饿的鲨鱼，等等。年轻的深海鱼受到萨瓦金的威胁最大，他们认为任何深海鱼的橡胶肉都是美味佳肴。",
	"Sometimes a young deepling will be taken in and raised by a group of triton, merfolk, or sailors. As they reach adulthood quickly, the deepling rapidly finds that it is not the same as its peers. As they learn that the world is much wider than the family they've come to know, most eventually leave their adopted families to seek out the mysteries on the horizon.": "有时，一个年轻的深海鱼会被一群特里顿人、人鱼族或水手收留并抚养。当他们迅速达到成年时，深海鱼迅速发现自己与同龄人不一样。当他们了解到这个世界比他们所认识的家庭要宽广得多时，大多数人最终会离开他们收养的家庭，去寻找地平线上的神秘。",
	"An unsolved problem is often irresistible to a deepling. They delight in learning new things—they would even rather learn new things than remember what they already know. The varied humanoid cultures of the world can be particularly fascinating for deeplings, who love to mix and match cultural affectations from those societies they find interesting or curious, such as habits of speech, patterns of body language, and rules for manners. Etiquette especially both mystifies and fascinates deeplings.": "一个未解决的问题往往对深层的人来说是不可抗拒的。他们乐于学习新事物--他们甚至宁愿学习新事物也不愿记住他们已经知道的东西。世界上不同的类人文化对深林人来说特别吸引人，他们喜欢混合和匹配那些他们认为有趣或好奇的社会的文化影响，比如说话的习惯、身体语言的模式和礼仪的规则。礼仪尤其让深层人士感到神秘和着迷。",
	"Deeplings are commonly regarded as aloof and clinical. They often take an interest in the problems of others, but almost always from a position of curiosity, rather than empathy. They don't have much of an innate sense of family, and rarely form sentimental bonds with others. When they do, however, deeplings cling to these new bonds more tenaciously than anything they've ever held in their short lives.": "深沉的人通常被认为是冷漠的和临床的。他们经常对别人的问题感兴趣，但几乎总是从好奇心出发，而不是从同情心出发。他们没有多少与生俱来的家庭感，而且很少与他人形成感情纽带。然而，当他们这样做时，深林人对这些新的纽带的依恋比他们在短暂的生命中所拥有的任何东西都更顽强。",
	"Having grown up in a lonely existence of instinct and predation, most deeplings don't conceive of a purpose beyond survival until they first meet other humanoids. Once they do, deeplings almost always pursue a calling that satisfies their natural curiosity, such as the exploration of unknown lands, the investigation of mysteries, or the excavation of ancient ruins and secrets. Because of these desires, deeplings become adventurers at a higher rate than almost any other humanoid race, although their general rarity still makes deepling adventurers very hard to find.": "在本能和捕食的孤独生活中长大，大多数深海生物在第一次遇到其他人类之前，不会想到生存以外的目的。一旦他们遇到了，深海人几乎总是追求一种能满足他们自然好奇心的召唤，比如探索未知的土地，调查神秘的事物，或者挖掘古代遗迹和秘密。由于这些欲望，深林人成为冒险家的比例几乎高于其他任何一个人形种族，尽管他们普遍的稀有性仍然使深林人的冒险家非常难找。",
	"Most deeplings are wizards, rogues, artificers, or fighters. Deeplings come upon these classes by their own curiosity, but this curiosity sometimes earns them the attention or favor of a teacher that can appreciate their talent for learning.": "大多数深渊人是巫师、流氓、工匠或战士。深海人通过自己的好奇心来接触这些阶级，但这种好奇心有时会让他们得到老师的注意或青睐，因为老师能欣赏他们的学习天赋。",
	"Deepling druids and rangers are usually taught their ways by keepers and watchers of the sea and coast, such as sea elves or tritons. Some discover places of primal power in the deep seas, and bond on their own with the spirits of nature. Many less-civilized deeplings are barbarians who learned their savage ways from the wild itself.": "深林德鲁伊和游侠通常由海洋和海岸的守护者和观察者教导他们的方法，比如海精灵或三爪鱼。有些人在深海中发现了原始力量的地方，并自行与自然之灵结合。许多文明程度较低的深海人是野蛮人，他们从野外本身学到了野蛮的方式。",
	"Having never experienced parental authority, most deeplings struggle to understand the relationships involved between a cleric or paladin and their divinity, or between a warlock and their patron. They rarely embrace such dynamics, but those that do usually become studious experts of the lore surrounding their new god or patron.": "由于从未经历过父母的权威，大多数深海人努力理解牧师或圣骑士与他们的神性之间，或术士与他们的守护者之间的关系。他们很少接受这种动态关系，但那些接受的人通常会成为围绕他们的新神或守护者的传说的研究专家。",
	"Deepling sorcerers are rare, but most are storm, shadow, or water sorcerers.": "深林巫师很罕见，但大多数是风暴、阴影或水的巫师。",
	"Deepling monks and bards are almost entirely unheard of, but a deepling can learn any vocation.": "深林僧侣和吟游诗人几乎完全没有听说过，但深林人可以学习任何职业。",
	"You can use the Deepling Quirks table to determine a personality quirk for a deepling character or to inspire a unique mannerism.": "你可以使用深林怪癖表来确定深林人物的个性怪癖，或激发出独特的举止。",
	"You yearn to explore anywhere you've never been before, and you love to search a room.": "你渴望探索任何你从未去过的地方，你喜欢搜索一个房间。",
	"You don't understand the concept of personal space. At all.": "你不理解个人空间的概念。根本不懂。",
	"You are fascinated by the concept of money, but you do not fully understand what is and isn't a currency, especially if it's shiny.": "你对金钱的概念很着迷，但你并不完全了解什么是和什么不是货币，尤其是当它是闪闪发光的时候。",
	"Surface food is not only amazingly delicious, but endlessly astounding to you in its variety.": "表面的食物不仅是惊人的美味，而且在种类上也让你感到无尽的震惊。",
	"You have been enamored with mathematics since it was taught to you, and you constantly attempt to estimate any chances of success.": "自从数学被教给你之后，你就迷上了数学，你不断尝试估计任何成功的机会。",
	"You enjoy impersonating your friends when around them, especially to make them happy.": "在朋友身边时，你喜欢冒充他们，尤其是为了让他们高兴。",
	"You refer to yourself as a plural such as \"we\" and \"us\" because it feels more accurate to you.": "你把自己称为复数，如 \"我们 \"和 \"我们\"，因为这对你来说感觉更准确。",
	"You never trust anything for sure unless you can investigate or experiment on it yourself.": "除非你能亲自调查或做实验，否则你永远不会相信任何东西是肯定的。",
	"Because deeplings never meet their parents and rarely form societies, they are almost never given names by fellow deeplings. Deeplings know the animals and plants of the sea without formal names, identifying things in their environment by their effect upon the individual deepling.": "由于深海生物从未见过他们的父母，也很少形成社会，他们几乎从未被其他深海生物赋予名字。深海生物知道海洋中的动物和植物，但没有正式的名字，它们通过对个体深海生物的影响来识别其环境中的事物。",
	"When a deepling enters into the society of another race, it is common for the deepling to be named by that race. Thus, many deepling adventurers carry a name from the first race or society that encountered them as a friend.": "当一个深林人进入另一个种族的社会时，深林人被那个种族命名是很常见的。因此，许多深灵冒险者都带着与他们相遇的第一个种族或社会的名字，作为朋友。",
	"There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf...": "现在房间里还有一盏灯，比夜灯亮一千倍，在我们说这句话的时间里，它已经在婴儿房的所有抽屉里寻找彼得的影子，翻遍了衣柜，把每个口袋都翻了个遍。它并不是真正的光；它是通过快速闪动而发出的光，但当它停下来的一瞬间，你看到它是一个仙女，不比你的手长，但仍在成长。那是一个叫小叮当的女孩，穿着精致的骷髅叶子的衣服......",
	"In the secluded glades and shrouded hollows of the wild world, if you search hard enough, you can find the races of tiny flying fey collectively known as fairies.": "在荒野世界僻静的小树林和被遮蔽的空地上，如果你足够努力寻找，你可以找到统称为仙女的微小飞行精灵种族。",
	"The term fairy refers to a few races of tiny fey with wings, such as pixies and sprites. Often ranked among the weakest of fey and rarely involved in great conflicts of history, these tiny people live their exceptionally long lives in the quiet of forest groves and other wild places. They are all imbued with an innate magic that is sought after by monsters and mortal mages alike, but most use this magic for little more than tricks and games when it isn't needed to keep them hidden.": "仙女这个词指的是一些有翅膀的小精灵种族，如小精灵和精灵。这些渺小的人通常被列为最弱小的精灵，而且很少参与历史上的巨大冲突，他们在森林小树林和其他野地的宁静中度过他们异常漫长的一生。他们都被赋予了一种天生的魔法，受到怪物和凡人法师的追捧，但大多数人在不需要这种魔法的时候，只是用它来做一些小把戏和游戏，以保持他们的隐秘。",
	"Fairies generally do what they can to avoid being discovered, so it is quite rare for them to want to adventure in the dangerous outside world. Some of them inevitably have wanderlust stronger than their caution, and find a reason to leave their community. Others are cast out or even exiled, perhaps for a crime, or perhaps simply for their unusual and unfairy-like similarity to humanoids. Whatever their reason for traveling, the fairy adventurer is an incredibly rare sight. Adventurers of all races swap hopeful tales of what questing with such strange and fantastic companions might be like.": "仙女们一般都会尽力避免被发现，所以他们想在危险的外部世界冒险的情况相当罕见。他们中的一些人不可避免地有比他们的谨慎更强烈的流浪欲望，并找到一个理由离开他们的社区。其他人则被赶出甚至流放，也许是因为犯罪，也许只是因为他们与人类不寻常的、不公平的相似性。无论他们旅行的原因是什么，仙女冒险家都是一个非常罕见的现象。所有种族的冒险家都在交换充满希望的故事，讲述与这种奇怪而奇妙的伙伴一起探险可能是什么样子。",
	"Fairies resemble very small elves, ranging from 5 to 10 inches tan with wings on their backs like the wings of butterflies, moths, or dragonflies. Like elves, they are slender and lithe, and they even have the same pointed ears. With their slight frame and tiny size, they usually weigh no more than 2 or 3 pounds. Fairies have skin colors mostly similar to elves, encompassing the range of human tones along with more amber, bronze, green, or blue shades. Their hair sometimes passes for human colorations, but can often be bright blue, green, or any other color. Some clans of pixies and scamps have even stranger colorations more befitting a fey.": "仙女类似于非常小的精灵，从5到10英寸不等，晒得很黑，背上的翅膀像蝴蝶、飞蛾或蜻蜓的翅膀。像精灵一样，他们身材苗条，体态轻盈，甚至有同样的尖耳朵。由于他们身材轻盈，体型微小，他们的体重通常不超过2或3磅。仙女的皮肤颜色大多与精灵相似，包括人类的色调范围以及更多的琥珀色、青铜色、绿色或蓝色的色调。他们的头发有时与人类的颜色相同，但通常可以是明亮的蓝色、绿色或任何其他颜色。一些小精灵和小矮人的家族甚至有更奇怪的颜色，更适合于精灵。",
	"The life of a fairy normally involves staying hidden from the outside world. While most of the more powerful fey usually ignore fairies and their villages except to enlist the occasional messenger or servant, the mortal world is eager to discover any pixies, sprites, or scamps that they can. Unfortunately, their eagerness usually goes too far. Fairies are commonly not only sought, but hunted by the outside races; they are prized for their innate magic, such as their wings or a pixie's dust. Some twisted few even seek and capture fairies simply to keep them in a deranged collection. These dark tales are what fairies tell their children to keep them from wandering too far from the safety of the hidden village, but that doesn't mean they aren't dangerously real.": "仙女的生活通常包括对外界保持隐蔽。虽然大多数更强大的费伊人通常会忽略仙女和他们的村庄，除了偶尔征召信使或仆人，但凡人世界渴望发现任何小精灵、精灵或恶棍，他们可以。不幸的是，他们的热切通常走得太远。仙子通常不仅被寻找，而且被外部种族追捕；他们因其与生俱来的魔法而受到珍视，比如他们的翅膀或精灵之尘。一些扭曲的少数人甚至寻找和捕获仙女，仅仅是为了将它们保存在一个疯狂的收藏中。这些黑暗的故事是仙女们告诉他们的孩子们，让他们不要离隐蔽的村庄的安全太远，但这并不意味着它们不是危险的真实。",
	"To stay safely hidden, fairies build their settlements in locations that are difficult for others to find. Commonly chosen spots include the insides of logs, the boughs of trees or willing treants, within rings of toadstools, and other natural hiding spots found in verdant glades and untouched wilderness. While most of them live within the Feywild, there are plenty of fairy communities on the Material Plane as well, but they are so well hidden that you might never know it!": "为了安全地隐藏起来，仙女们在别人难以发现的地方建造他们的定居点。通常选择的地点包括原木的内侧、树木的枝桠或自愿的树人、蛤蟆石的环内，以及其他在青翠的树丛和未开发的荒野中发现的自然藏身之处。虽然他们大多生活在仙界，但在物质界也有很多仙人社区，但他们隐藏得很好，你可能永远都不会知道。",
	"In some worlds, the wee folk have to fend off not only those that seek to harvest their innate magic, but even the natural predators who will hunt anything fairy-sized. One common example is the long-time nemesis of all wee folk and little animals—the cat. In other worlds, the magic of the fairies wards off such mundane threats, but fairies still face predation at the paws of the cunning magical cats that lurk in the Feywild.": "在一些世界里，小精灵们不仅要抵御那些试图收获他们与生俱来的魔法的人，甚至还要抵御那些会猎杀任何仙女大小的自然捕食者。一个常见的例子是所有小精灵和小动物的长期克星--猫。在其他世界，仙女的魔法可以抵御这些世俗的威胁，但仙女仍然面临着潜伏在仙界的狡猾的魔猫的掠夺。",
	"Fairies are usually given names by their parents, but they lack family or clan names. They sometimes choose to rely entirely on nicknames that they have picked out for themselves. Fairies also might choose a name taken from the other races instead of a traditional fairy name, sometimes even naming themselves or others after a simple noun that the fairy finds intriguing instead of a proper name. Traditional fairy names, by contrast, often involve aspects of nature, especially ones as small as the fairies themselves, such as bugs or flowers.": "仙女们的名字通常是由他们的父母给予的，但他们缺乏家族或宗族的名字。他们有时会选择完全依靠自己为自己取的绰号。仙女们也可能选择从其他种族那里取的名字，而不是传统的仙女名字，有时甚至用仙女觉得有趣的简单名词来给自己或他人命名，而不是用一个正式名字。相比之下，传统的仙女名字往往涉及自然界的方方面面，特别是像仙女自己一样小的名字，如虫子或花。",
	"Some clans of sprites eschew this pattern entirely, naming themselves exclusively with elven names. Some pixies and scamps on the other hand are enamored with the outsider concept of family names, and, lacking a full understanding of the purpose of such a name, adopt a family name that they've heard from another race, such as \"Goodfellow.\" Such names are usually taken only for amusement and are only used when the fairy is among non-fairies; they are rarely passed on to children.": "有些精灵部族完全摒弃了这种模式，只用精灵的名字为自己命名。另一方面，一些小精灵和小混混迷上了家族名字的外人概念，由于对这种名字的目的缺乏充分的了解，就采用了他们从其他种族那里听到的家族名字，如 \"Goodfellow\"。这样的名字通常只是为了娱乐而取，只在仙女在非仙女中时使用；它们很少传给孩子。",

	"Tiny-sized weapons and armor cost half as much and weigh only one-fifth as much as normal, but they are very difficult for larger creatures to create.

	"Of course, tiny creatures have a wealth of alternatives for armor and weapons. A fairy might use a large sewing needle as a rapier, use a sheriff's badge as a shield, or use a torn leather glove as armor. Others may consider such equipment a bit silly, but one has no concern for silliness when guarding oneself from the steely claws of a dragon or the wicked dagger of a cultist.": "当然，微小的生物有大量的替代品作为盔甲和武器。仙女可以用一根大缝衣针当剑，用一个警长的徽章当盾牌，或者用一只破皮手套当盔甲。其他人可能会认为这样的装备有点傻，但在保护自己不受龙的钢爪或邪教分子的邪恶匕首伤害时，就不会担心傻了。",

	"A Tiny creature is small enough that striking it directly with a full-sized weapon can be difficult, and most contact would be glancing or slight.
