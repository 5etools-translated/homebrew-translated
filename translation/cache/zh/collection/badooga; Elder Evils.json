Unaware that the draudnus slew their employer, the babaus snuck into the church, leaving their tracks about the grounds. The draudnus soon followed and assaulted the church directly, one of their number falling in a pitched battle that took the lives of a large number of clerics and monks.

	"Having no need for sustenance doesn't stop these dim creatures from hunting. Black cysts seem to take special delight from dissolving the flesh of their victims, and when they kill a mortal, they set to work liquefying the victim with their unspeakable essences in a process that can take hours.

	"Cursing with every step, begging his feet to turn around so he might save his friends, his body denied him for the fear had a grip on his heart and there was no turning back. So he ran.

The sounds of his pursuers were close. Too close.": "他每走一步都在咒骂，求他的脚转过来，这样他就可以救他的朋友，但他的身体拒绝了他，因为恐惧已经控制了他的心，没有回头路了。于是他跑了起来。他跑了几分钟，但感觉像是几天，在恐慌中，他失去了对自己位置的追踪，在荒凉的走廊和被诅咒的矿井生锈的栏杆中失去了自我。当他的呼吸变得急促，身边的疼痛迫使他停下来时，他倒下了，泪水从他的眼睛里涌出，小小的啜泣声从他干裂的嘴唇里逸出。他知道自己必死无疑。追兵的声音很近。太近了。",

	"Fleeing through the tunnels, he eventually became lost and stumbled into a chamber containing a great abomination, a fragment of Tharizdun's personality severed at the time of his imprisonment. Giorge's sudden arrival and the approach of more fishfolk hunters caused the great horror to awaken and snatch Giorge, plunging the mortal into the thickened waters contaminated by its rot. Beneath the churning surface, the entity known as Shothragot infested Giorge's mind, rent his spirit, and seized his body, transforming it into something else entirely.": "在隧道中逃亡，他最终迷失了方向，偶然进入了一个装有巨大憎恶的房间，那是塔里兹敦在被囚禁时被切断的人格碎片。乔吉的突然到来和更多的鱼人猎人的接近使巨大的恐怖苏醒并抓住了乔吉，使这个凡人陷入了被它的腐烂所污染的浓水之中。在汹涌的水面下，被称为Shothragot的实体侵袭了Giorge的思想，撕裂了他的精神，并抓住了他的身体，将其完全转化为另一种东西。",
	"The elder evil awakened a trace of fiendish blood that lay dormant in the broken ranger, causing him to become a tiefling. The severe agony of transformation shattered Giorge's mind, and when he was spit out upon the shores, he gibbered like an idiot, shrieking and laughing by turns for days on end. But the thing in the pool was not through with its first disciple.": "长老的邪恶唤醒了沉睡在这个残破游侠体内的一丝恶魔之血，使他变成了一个铁弗林。变身的剧烈痛苦击碎了乔吉的心灵，当他被吐在岸边时，他像个白痴一样叽叽喳喳地叫着，连续几天轮流尖叫和大笑。但池中的东西并没有完成它的第一个弟子。",
	"Shothragot swelled out from the pool's depths and instructed Giorge to go forth to spread the news of its coming, and also to find and destroy its enemies. The new champion had no choice but to agree since Shothragot possessed his soul. And so he went out into the world, scouring the lands through which he traveled for those he perceived as threats and for those marked by his god as being chosen to die. When he finds them, he does as he has been commanded. He kills.": "Shothragot从池子的深处膨胀出来，并指示Giorge前去传播它到来的消息，同时也要找到并消灭它的敌人。新冠军别无选择，只能同意，因为肖特拉戈特拥有他的灵魂。于是他走向世界，在他所经过的土地上搜寻那些他认为是威胁的人，以及那些被他的神标记为被选中的人。当他找到他们时，他就按照他的命令行事。他杀了人。",
	"The experience in the Crater Ridge Mines left Giorge Forsworn changed in body and mind. The physical changes, while profound, compared little to the evil filling the vessel of his soul. The entity in the shadowy cave filled his mind with disturbing visions of apocalypse and planted instructions that grew and thrived in the haunted corridors of his thoughts. Now when he draws close to an individual Shothragot deems a threat—no matter how minor—Giorge sees a fiery glyph burning on her brow. This sigil marks those Giorge must kill even though each murder pained him, reducing him to tears for he knew in his heart that what he did was wrong. But Giorge serves because nothing else is permitted to him—nothing beyond furthering his master's ambitions, and no doubt—no hesitation—will ever stop him from fulfilling his profane duty.": "在火山口岭矿区的经历使乔吉-福斯沃恩的身体和心灵都发生了变化。身体上的变化虽然很深刻，但与充斥在他灵魂容器中的邪恶相比，却显得微不足道。阴暗洞穴中的实体在他的脑海中充满了令人不安的天启幻象，并种下了指令，这些指令在他思想的鬼魂走廊中成长和茁壮。现在，当他接近一个被Shothragot视为威胁的人时--无论多么微小--乔治看到她的眉毛上燃烧着一个火红的石刻。这个符号标志着Giorge必须杀死的人，尽管每一次谋杀都让他感到痛苦，让他流泪，因为他心里知道他的所作所为是错误的。但乔尔格服役的原因是，除了促进他主人的野心之外，他没有别的选择，没有任何怀疑--没有任何犹豫--会阻止他履行他的神圣职责。",
	"Giorge Forsworn is insane. He is a villain in his own right, but he is also a servant of an elder evil. Shothragot has a penchant for remaking mortals into useful servants, bending their bodies and minds to become fitting tools for use in its own agenda of freeing Tharizdun. Giorge, then, is an extension of the elder evil's will. He travels endlessly, moving through the lands, always watching and searching for those marked for death. He is a reluctant servant, haunted by the memories of his life before the touch of evil, and he despairs about his fate. Even the company of a {@creature Mask|EdE|beautiful nymph} is not enough to drag him from his melancholic thoughts, though she uses every trick she can to distract him from his suffering.": "乔吉-福斯沃恩是个疯子。他本身就是一个恶棍，但他也是一个长老级恶魔的仆人。Shothragot喜欢把凡人改造成有用的仆人，把他们的身体和思想改造成合适的工具，用于自己解放塔里兹敦的计划。因此，乔吉是长老邪恶意志的延伸。他无休止地旅行，在这片土地上移动，一直在观察和寻找那些被标记为死亡的人。他是一个不情愿的仆人，被他在接触邪恶之前的生活记忆所困扰，他对自己的命运感到绝望。即使有一个{@creature Mask|EdE|beautiful nymph}的陪伴，也不足以把他从忧郁的思绪中拖出来，尽管她用尽一切办法让他从痛苦中转移注意力。",
	"Regardless of his detestation for his work, he cannot stop himself. He must do as his master commands and he has no concept of sparing his victims. Therefore, in spite of his reluctance, Giorge is a foul adversary that strikes seemingly at random. In one village, he might slaughter an entire family of peasants, and in the next, he may burn down a temple of St. Cuthbert. Even he has no idea why his targets are selected. He only knows that they are.": "无论他对自己的工作有多厌恶，他都无法阻止自己。他必须按照主人的命令行事，他没有放过受害者的概念。因此，尽管他很不情愿，但乔尔格是一个可怕的对手，他似乎是随意出手的。在一个村子里，他可能会屠杀一整个农民家庭，而在下一个村子里，他可能会烧毁一座圣卡斯特伯特庙。甚至他也不知道为什么他的目标被选中。他只知道他们是。",
	"Giorge Forsworn discovered Shothragot imprisoned deep within the Undermountain. Much of his murders are confined to the city of Waterdeep above the elder evil, but Giorge has blood from all across the Sword Coast on his hands.": "乔吉-福斯沃恩发现肖特拉戈特被囚禁在地下山的深处。他的大部分谋杀案都被限制在水底城的长老邪恶之上，但乔吉的手上沾满了整个剑海岸的血。",

	"Dorn doesn't want to serve Zargon, but his master has commanded it. He must do as he was bidden, so he returned to the Lost City and the madness of his people. Soon after arriving, he met Vanessa, who convinced him to slay his father and take command of the cult. With the filthy deed done, Dorn is even more insane and secretly murders his people to quell the rage growing within him. Given the chance, Dorn would slay Zargon himself, but he knows such thoughts are mad.": "多恩并不想为扎贡服务，但他的主人已经命令他这样做。他必须听从命令，所以他回到了失落之城和他的人民的疯狂中。到达后不久，他遇到了瓦妮莎，她说服他杀死他的父亲并指挥邪教。肮脏的事做完后，多恩更加疯狂，他秘密地谋杀了他的人民，以平息他内心的愤怒。如果有机会，多恩会亲自杀了扎贡，但他知道这种想法是疯狂的。",

	"The majority of avolakias have taken to worshiping Kyuss, a little-known quasi-deity.

	"So eager are the avolakias to elevate Kyuss to full deity status that they actively recruit new worshipers for his cult. The creatures typically establish settlements beneath the communities of surface races, then use their Shapechanger and {@spell suggestion} abilities to infiltrate their target areas. Often a group of avolakias infiltrates a local religious institution and attempts to assume control of the funerary rites for the community. Should the avolakias succeed, they have access to plenty of corpses that they can use to create more undead. In addition, the disguised avolakias are in a perfect position to corrupt selected members of the community and slowly indoctrinate them into the {@cult Kyuss the Worm That Walks|EdE|cult of Kyuss}.": "阿沃拉基亚人如此渴望将凯斯提升到完全的神灵地位，以至于他们积极为他的崇拜者招募新的崇拜者。这些生物通常在地表种族的社区下面建立定居点，然后利用他们的变形术和（%0%）能力渗透到他们的目标区域。通常情况下，一群阿沃拉基亚人潜入当地的宗教机构，并试图控制该社区的葬礼仪式。如果阿沃拉基亚人成功了，他们就可以获得大量的尸体，用来制造更多的亡灵。此外，经过伪装的阿沃拉基亚人处于一个完美的位置，可以腐蚀社区中选定的成员，并慢慢地将他们灌输到（1%）。",
	"Avolakias also interact with various Underdark races. Some, such as the drow, they infiltrate in much the same way as they do surface races. With others, such as mind flayers, they openly propose alliances for the two groups' mutual benefit. A typical agreement between mind flayers and avolakias stipulates that both groups hunt down and capture intelligent beings. The mind flayers consume the unfortunate victims' brains, then hand the bodies over to the avolakias, who use them to create undead. But such alliances tend to fall apart eventually, either when the mind flayers enslave captives for long periods before consuming their brains, or when the avolakias kill a few mind flayers to make more powerful undead creatures.": "阿沃拉基亚人还与各种暗黑种族互动。有些种族，比如乌鸦，他们的渗透方式与他们对地面种族的渗透方式基本相同。对于其他的种族，比如说噬心者，他们公开提议结盟，以实现两个群体的共同利益。噬心者和阿沃拉基亚之间的一个典型协议规定，两个群体都要追捕和捕获智能生物。噬心者吞噬不幸的受害者的大脑，然后将尸体交给阿沃拉基亚人，后者用它们来创造亡灵。但这样的联盟最终往往会分崩离析，要么是在噬心者长期奴役俘虏，然后再吞噬他们的大脑，要么是阿沃拉基亚人杀死一些噬心者以制造更强大的不死生物。",

In a state of semiwakefulness, however, the Leviathan is susceptible to at least partial control, and its enormous destructive powers can be channeled against specific targets. Axihuatl intends to turn it against the surface-dwellers and their hated continents, leaving the world under miles of water where the ixitxachitl can rule unopposed.

	"A corrupture instinctively moves toward any moving object or creature larger than Tiny size and attacks it, trampling others in its rush to dissolve and taste flesh. Stubborn in its mindless hunger, a corrupture doggedly continues attacking the creature it first tastes. It uses its acid burst whenever its prey and at least one other creature are within range, or if it is blocked by a creature larger than it can trample. If a group of foes flee a corrupture, it follows only its prey, following the nearest creature if it has not yet tasted flesh. Once its initial prey dies, the corrupture attacks the largest fleshly creature of which it is aware; if no others are nearby, the ooze begins consuming its meal at leisure.": "腐化者本能地走向任何移动的物体或大于Tiny大小的生物，并攻击它，在急于溶解和品尝肉体的过程中践踏其他人。腐化者顽固地保持着无意识的饥饿感，顽强地继续攻击它第一次品尝的生物。只要它的猎物和至少一个其他生物在范围内，或者它被一个比它能践踏的更大的生物所阻挡，它就会使用它的酸液爆裂。如果一群敌人逃离腐化者，它只跟随它的猎物，如果它还没有尝到肉的味道，就跟随最近的生物。一旦最初的猎物死亡，腐烂者就会攻击它所知道的最大的肉体生物；如果附近没有其他生物，腐烂者就会开始悠闲地吞噬它的食物。",
	"A corrupture ignores creatures it cannot taste after its first attack, such as those not susceptible to its acid or those lacking flesh—at least until they move out of the range of its blindsight. (The mindless ooze cannot recognize a new moving object as one that it hit before.) Creatures immune to acid can escape harm simply by not attacking back after first being struck. The oozes seem to instinctively recognize that other corruptures aren't prey.": "腐化物在第一次攻击后会忽略它无法品尝的生物，比如那些不受其酸液影响的生物或缺乏肉体的生物--至少在它们移出它的盲视范围之前。(无意识敖包无法识别一个新的移动物体是它之前击中的物体）。对酸液免疫的生物只需在第一次被击中后不回击，就能逃脱伤害。渗水虫似乎能本能地识别出其他腐化物不是猎物。",

	"Corruptures come into being wherever the wilderness has been horribly befouled or natural laws have been repeatedly broken. In such places, nature reacts with a rent in existence that births a corrupture before closing, an embodiment of the cancerous damage to the world. Corruptures commonly appear in wilderness areas that have been poisoned or diseased, or that are heavily influenced by magic or another plane. Rarely they appear in civilized areas. Mundane defilement, such as razing a forest or draining a swamp, isn't enough to create a corrupture, but an arcane laboratory used for magical experimentation on creatures might well do so.": "在荒野被可怕地破坏或自然法则被反复破坏的地方，腐败就会出现。在这样的地方，自然界的反应是存在一个裂缝，在关闭之前诞生一个腐化物，是对世界的癌症损害的体现。腐败通常出现在被毒害或病变的荒野地区，或者受到魔法或另一个世界严重影响的地方。它们很少出现在文明地区。世俗的玷污，例如夷平一片森林或排干一片沼泽，并不足以产生腐化，但用于对生物进行魔法实验的奥术实验室很可能会这样做。",
	"A corrupture is a mindless hunter, driven by instinct to hunt down the nearest prey of fair size. It draws food and water directly through its skin, first dissolving flesh with its acid and then moving over the gooey remains.

They can feed on carrion if necessary, but they prefer fresh, fluid-filled prey.": "腐蚀者是一个无意识的猎手，在本能的驱使下，猎杀最近的大小猎物。它直接通过皮肤吸取食物和水，首先用它的酸液溶解肉体，然后在粘稠的残骸上移动。腐尸能够在短时间内靠植物物质生存，但至少每周需要一次肉。如果有必要，它们可以以腐肉为食，但它们更喜欢新鲜、充满液体的猎物。",
	"Corruptures have no gender and do not mate: They just get bigger. An undamaged corrupture with plenty to eat molts its outer flesh as it grows. This process takes a month of uninterrupted hibernation. After this time, the corrupture has an even more voracious appetite for several weeks. Larger, ancient corruptures begin to lose the ability to move under their own power. Such massive sacks of flesh can actually become stationary and starve.": "腐败分子没有性别，也不交配。它们只是变得更大。一个未受损害的腐化动物，如果有充足的食物，就会在成长过程中蜕去其外皮的肉。这个过程需要一个月的不间断的冬眠。在这段时间之后，腐蚀者在几个星期内会有更加贪婪的胃口。较大的、古老的腐蚀体开始失去在其自身力量下移动的能力。这种巨大的肉袋实际上可以成为静止的和饥饿的。",
	"Corruptures can appear in any sullied environment, even the sea.": "腐败可以出现在任何被玷污的环境中，甚至是大海。",
	"A corrupture is a large mass of semifluid flesh approximately 15 feet in diameter. It constantly undulates and pulses, making its exact mass difficult to determine, but a typical example weighs about 6,000 pounds. Corruptures' flesh varies in color from tan to pink to angry red, and is covered in a web of veins, bruises, and sores. Boils of thick, yellow acid swell up on its surface every few seconds, bursting to spray the area. The skin of a corrupture is covered with the residue of these eruptions, coating it in a caustic slime.": "腐化物是一大块半流体的肉，直径约为15英尺。它不断地起伏和跳动，使其确切的质量难以确定，但一个典型的例子大约有6000磅重。腐败者的肉体颜色各不相同，从棕褐色到粉红色再到愤怒的红色，并覆盖着网状的血管、瘀伤和溃疡。浓稠的黄色酸液每隔几秒钟就会在其表面膨胀起来，爆裂开来喷洒在该地区。腐败者的皮肤上覆盖着这些喷发的残余物，涂上一层腐蚀性的粘液。",

By the time Kyuss vanished, most of his ulgurstastas had become at least as intelligent as ghouls. Knowing that they would be hunted down and destroyed by Kyuss's remaining enemies, the ulgurstastas retreated deep into the wilderness. Despite their attempt at self-preservation, most of them were hunted down and slain in the coming years, until only a handful survived deep in the Wormcrawl Fissure.

Their orders once drove them to convert living beings into skeletons, but as time wore on, this drive has been replaced by a need to become more intelligent.

It is not unlikely that in some forgotten corner of the Wormcrawl, there might lurk an ulgurstasta of genius level or higher; these ulgurstastas might even have mastered the school of Necromancy themselves.": "由于他们是通过强大的死灵魔法创造的，这些生物不能繁殖，也不需要呼吸或进食。他们的命令曾经驱使他们将活人转化为骷髅，但随着时间的推移，这种驱动力已经被变得更加智能的需求所取代。一般来说，由乌尔古斯塔斯塔创造的每一千具骷髅都能让它保留足够的思想和记忆，以获得一分智能。在虫爬的某个被遗忘的角落里，可能潜伏着一个天才级别或更高的ulgurstasta；这些ulgurstastas甚至可能自己掌握了Necromancy的学问，这也不是不可能的。",
	"Ulgurstastas have grown much more intelligent over the centuries and behave accordingly. An ulgurstasta attacks with its jaws. These jaws are mounted on a flexible stalk and have a reach of 15 feet.": "几个世纪以来，Ulgurstastas已经变得更加聪明，并有相应的行为。Ulgurstasta用它的下颚进行攻击。这些下巴安装在一个灵活的柄上，有15英尺的距离。",
	"This creature's hairless, overlarge head surmounts its wet, wrinkled, and bloated humanoid body. Its eyes are glassy and vacant. Its arms are too slender, and its tiny hands end in cruelly sharpened nails, while its legs are atrophied, dead things that hang useless below it.": "这种生物没有毛发，巨大的头顶着湿漉漉的、有皱纹的、臃肿的人形身体。它的眼睛是玻璃状的、空洞的。它的手臂过于纤细，小手的末端是残忍的尖锐的指甲，而它的腿是萎缩的死物，挂在下面没有用。",
	"Atropal scions are clots of divine flesh given form and animation by bleak-hearted gods of death. When a stillborn godling rises spontaneously as an undead, an atropal is born. If that atropal is defeated, but any fragment or cast-off bit of flesh remains, an atropal scion may yet arise from those fragments, lessened in power from its divine beginnings, but no less hateful for its stature.": "阿托帕尔子孙是由心境凄凉的死亡之神赋予形态和活力的神肉块。当一个死产的神灵自发地上升为亡灵，一个阿托帕尔就诞生了。如果阿托帕尔被打败了，但任何碎片或被抛弃的肉体仍然存在，一个阿托帕尔的子孙可能会从这些碎片中产生，它的力量比它的神性开始时要小，但它的地位并不逊于它的仇恨。",
	"Unlike normal {@creature atropal|ToA|atropals}, atropal scions are imbued with foul magic that grants them a smidgen of spellcasting. Given enough time, an atropal scion may evolve into a threat much greater than the undead it originally splintered off of.": "与普通的（%0%）不同，阿托帕尔的后裔被灌输了污秽的魔法，赋予他们一丁点的法术能力。如果有足够的时间，阿托帕尔后裔可能会演化成比它最初分裂出来的亡灵更大的威胁。",

It directs its innate spells and abilities upon those foes its mere presence cannot kill.": "一种令人灵魂麻木的寒冷在一个萎缩的子孙面前和之后出现。英雄生物的生命能量被压制在它肮脏的光环中，而较弱的生物的生命力则被熄灭。它将其天生的法术和能力用于那些它的存在无法杀死的敌人。",
	"Atropus is as much a place as it is a being. It is a small moonlet spinning through the void, waiting to be ensnared by the pull of the planets it nears. To those on the surface of the chosen world, the elder evil appears as a speck in the sky. At night it is almost invisible, blending in with the darkness, but during twilight and dawn, it looks like a moving pinhole of darkness.": "阿特罗普斯既是一个地方，也是一种存在。它是一个在虚空中旋转的小月球，等待着被它所接近的行星的拉力所捕获。对于那些在被选中的世界表面的人来说，这个邪恶的老人就像天空中的一个斑点。在晚上，它几乎看不见，与黑暗融为一体，但在黄昏和黎明时分，它看起来像一个移动的黑暗针孔。",
	"As it draws closer and its sign intensifies, it grows, expanding from a tiny dot to a small disk until it dominates the sky. Pitted and slick with the black slime of the putrid amniotic fluid of its birth, it hangs above, always drifting away from the light of the sun and lurking overhead when the sun has fled. It has the appearance of a huge chunk of black stone, but from certain angles, it looks like a great hairless head, black eyes glassy and soulless.": "随着它的距离越来越近，它的标志也越来越强烈，从一个小点扩大到一个小圆盘，直到它主宰了整个天空。坑坑洼洼、滑溜溜的黑色粘液是它出生时的腐烂羊水，它悬挂在上面，总是远离太阳的光芒，当太阳逃走时，它就潜伏在头顶上。它的外表是一块巨大的黑石头，但从某些角度看，它又像一个巨大的无毛头，黑色的眼睛是玻璃状的，没有灵魂。",
	"Atropus has no understandable personality and no inclinations other than craving the destruction of all living things. This rock is not uninhabited: Undead conjured from the darkest nightmares infest it. These horrors claim the craters for themselves, flitting through the shadows, ravenous for the energy of the living. The master of them all is the focus, an extension of Atropus's will.": "阿特罗普斯没有可以理解的个性，除了渴望毁灭所有生物之外，没有其他倾向。这块岩石并非无人居住。从最黑暗的噩梦中召唤出来的亡灵在这里出没。这些恐怖的东西将火山口据为己有，在阴影中飞来飞去，贪婪地汲取活人的能量。它们的主人是焦点，是阿特罗普斯意志的延伸。",
	"The focus is a headless, human-shaped creature with flesh fossilized during Atropus's endless roaming through the cosmos. Closer inspection reveals that its foul body shares the same hideous coating that wells up from the rents and fissures on the moonlet's surface.": "焦点是一个无头的人形生物，其肉体在阿特罗普斯无休止地在宇宙中漫游时被化石化。仔细观察会发现，它那肮脏的身体与小月球表面的裂缝中涌出的可怕涂层相同。",

	"Stalking the wastelands in preparation for Father Llymic's awakening, the brood mirror their creator's twisted form. Birthed from the bodies of unsuspecting creatures, the brood are pale mockeries of their former selves, recast in plates of frozen crystal with vicious claws and sharp-edged teeth.": "在荒原上徘徊，为Llymic神父的觉醒做准备，兄弟们反映了他们创造者的扭曲形态。从毫无戒心的生物的身体中孕育出来的肉身，是他们以前的苍白的嘲弄，在冰冻的水晶板中重铸，有着凶恶的爪子和锋利的牙齿。",
	"The brood remember nothing of their former lives and seek only to carry out Father Llymic's will. They prowl the area around his frozen form, subduing intruders and native creatures and taking them to be transformed. If a threat to Father Llymic surfaces, the brood take any means necessary to drive off or destroy the enemy.": "这些孩子对他们以前的生活毫无印象，只想执行父亲Llymic的意志。他们在他的冰冻形态周围徘徊，制服入侵者和本地生物，并带他们去接受改造。如果对Llymic神父的威胁浮出水面，他们会采取任何必要的手段来赶走或消灭敌人。",
	"The brood are the primary adversaries the party faces when dealing with Father Llymic. Although initial encounters might involve crazed cultists who venerate the alien creature, these soon succumb to Father Llymic's will and become the first brood. At first the brood consist of nothing more than vague rumors and lone sightings, but as Father Llymic's strength grows, they become an overwhelming threat, marching out from their icy home to spread their plague. As the end draws near, the brood are everywhere, having transformed every creature near Father Llymic's icy prison.": "雏鸟是党在对付Llymic神父时面临的主要对手。虽然最初遇到的可能是崇拜外星生物的疯狂崇拜者，但这些人很快就会屈服于Llymic神父的意志，成为第一批雏形。起初，这群人只是一些模糊的传言和单独的目击者，但随着Llymic神父力量的增长，他们成为一种压倒性的威胁，从他们冰冷的家出发，传播他们的瘟疫。随着末日的临近，这些虫子无处不在，它们改造了Llymic神父冰冷监狱附近的每一个生物。",
	"Retaining only a vague resemblance to the creatures that spawned them, the brood are terrible to behold. Made entirely of pale blue crystal, brood spawn are covered in sharp spikes and ridged plates. These protrusions grind against one another but never dull. When a brood spawn is wounded, a pale ichor flows out of the wounds, quickly hardening into a seal. Strange organs pulsate and strain inside them, and no two share the same physiology, even if they originated from the same type of creature. All have three perfectly round eyes atop their head, above a cavernous maw. These eyes allow them to see in any conditions of illumination.": "虫卵与产生它们的生物只有模糊的相似之处，它们是可怕的。完全由淡蓝色的水晶制成，雏形的卵子覆盖着锋利的尖刺和脊板。这些突起物相互磨擦，但从不迟钝。当一个卵巢受伤时，一种苍白的汁液会从伤口处流出，很快就会硬化成一个封印。陌生的器官在它们体内跳动和紧张，没有两个人的生理结构是相同的，即使它们源自同一类型的生物。它们的头顶上都有三只完美的圆眼，在一个空洞的大嘴之上。这些眼睛使它们能够在任何照明条件下看到东西。",
	"Mentally, all brood spawn are extensions of Father Llymic's thoughts. They carry out his desires without any need for communication. The spawn go about their business with cold precision, completely uncaring of those in their path. The brood have only two goals: to protect Father Llymic and to expand the brood.": "在精神上，所有的雏鸟都是父亲Llymic思想的延伸。他们执行他的愿望，不需要任何交流。卵子们冷酷无情地做着自己的事情，完全不关心那些在他们路上的人。卵子们只有两个目标：保护父亲Llymic和扩大卵子。",
	"The deity {@deity Tiamat}, Creator of Evil Dragonkind, has long sought domination of the world for herself and her progeny. For eons she has struggled against Bahamut, the King of Good Dragons, in a conflict called the Dragonfall War, and most people believed that this battle would last for millennia to come.": "神灵（%0%），邪恶龙族的创造者，长期以来一直在为自己和她的后代寻求对世界的统治。长久以来，她一直在与善龙之王巴哈姆特斗争，这场冲突被称为降龙战争，大多数人认为这场战斗将持续数千年之久。",
	"Recently, however, Tiamat unveiled her latest and most terrifying tactic. She created diverse and numerous creatures with the blood of chromatic dragons and sent forth these spawn to spread destruction and evil. This incursion of evil dragonblood creatures threatens the balance of the war and, by extension, the world.": "然而，最近，提亚马特公布了她最新和最可怕的策略。她用色龙的血创造了多种多样的生物，并派出这些产卵来传播破坏和邪恶。这种邪恶的龙血生物的入侵威胁着战争的平衡，进而威胁着世界。",
	"To thwart her ambitions, Bahamut created the noble dragonborn, but the challenge of fighting evil dragonkind demands even more heroes than the Platinum Dragon can produce. Today, Tiamat has the upper hand. It might well fall to the player characters to prevent her spawn from permanently tipping the Dragonfall War in favor of evil.": "为了挫败她的野心，巴哈姆特创造了高贵的龙族，但与邪恶的龙族作战的挑战需要比白金龙所能产生的更多的英雄。今天，提亚马特占了上风。阻止她的卵子使降龙战争永久地倾向于邪恶，这很可能落在玩家角色身上。",
	"Every spawn of Tiamat has some vestige of the power of the Queen of Evil Dragons in its blood. Many, though, are born not directly to her but to individual evil dragons throughout the world. Whether chosen by Tiamat herself or only by fickle chance, some chromatic dragon eggs hatch into the spawn described in this section. Usually a single egg is so touched, but occasionally an entire clutch produces spawn of Tiamat (which might not even be all the same kind). A given spawn is born only to a dragon that matches its color, which combined with the word \"spawn,\" forms part of its name. Blackspawn raiders and blackspawn stalkers, for example, are born only to black dragons. Although spawn first began to appear within clutches of dragon eggs, most of them breed true and now are rapidly multiplying.": "每一个提亚马特的后代都在其血液中带有恶龙女王力量的某些痕迹。不过，许多人不是直接为她而生，而是为全世界的个别恶龙而生。不管是由提亚马特自己选择，还是仅凭善变的机会，一些色龙蛋会孵化成本节所述的产卵。通常情况下，一个蛋会被触动，但偶尔一整窝龙会产生提亚马特的卵子（甚至可能不是同一种类）。一个特定的卵只生在与其颜色相匹配的龙身上，这与 \"卵 \"字相结合，构成其名称的一部分。例如，黑龙突袭者和黑龙潜行者，只为黑龙所生。尽管卵子最初是在龙蛋群中出现的，但它们中的大多数都是真正的繁殖者，现在正在迅速繁殖中。",
	"Evil dragons recognize the birth of a spawn of Tiamat as a fortunate omen, a sign of their creator's favor. That said, spawn rarely remain with their parents for long. They mature much more quickly than true dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years. Spawn of Tiamat usually congregate with other creatures, whether in packs of their kind or with like-minded individuals of other races, particularly evil dragons. Reports have surfaced recently of hobgoblin clerics and warlords gathering spawn of Tiamat and other evil dragons for a great battle. Whether this is part of Tiamat's plan for the Dragonfall War or stems from the goblinoids' general antipathy toward other races is unknown.": "恶龙认为提亚马特的卵子的诞生是一个幸运的预兆，是它们的创造者青睐的标志。话虽如此，产卵者很少与他们的父母长期在一起。它们比真龙成熟得更快，只需几年就能成年。提亚马特的产卵通常与其他生物聚集在一起，无论是在它们的族群中还是与其他种族的志同道合者，特别是恶龙。最近有报道称，妖精教士和军阀将提亚马特和其他邪龙的卵子聚集在一起进行一场伟大的战斗。这是否是提亚马特的降龙战争计划的一部分，还是源于妖精们对其他种族的普遍反感，我们不得而知。",
	"Regardless of their place in the world, all spawn share an unswerving loyalty to Tiamat, which their would-be allies would do well to remember. The spawn of Tiamat also share her undying hatred of good dragonkind, and they look down upon nondragons of all sorts.": "无论他们在这个世界上的地位如何，所有的产卵者都对提亚马特有着坚定不移的忠诚，他们的盟友最好记住这一点。提亚马特的后代也与她一样，对善良的龙族有着不死的仇恨，他们看不起各种非龙族。",
	"Tiamat is not pleased with the attitude many of her children have adopted. She is proud of the role chromatic dragons played in defeating the fiends and the quori, but she feels that they now waste time worrying about the Prophecy instead of subjugating the world.": "提亚马特对她的许多孩子所采取的态度并不满意。她为半音阶龙在击败魔族和科里的过程中所发挥的作用感到骄傲，但她觉得他们现在把时间浪费在担心预言上而不是征服世界。",
	"Some chromatic dragons agree with her and have rededicated themselves to her cause. In addition, she has whispered promises of a return of the great Dhakaani Empire to certain hobgoblin warlords in Darguun. Using these contacts, Tiamat has been able to seed the world with her spawn, and they are ready for when the call to battle goes forth.": "一些色龙同意她的观点，并重新献身于她的事业。此外，她还向达尔古恩的某些妖精军阀低声许诺了伟大的达卡尼帝国的回归。利用这些联系，提亚马特已经能够在世界范围内播撒她的卵子，他们已经准备好迎接战斗的召唤。",
	"Chromatic dragons not allied with Tiamat see the spawn's arrival as a dire portent that must somehow be related to the Prophecy, but they are oblivious to the true danger. They continue to do that for which Tiamat condemns them: They wait and watch, hoping to learn the true nature of these new dragonblood through observation and reflection on the Prophecy.": "未与提亚马特结盟的色龙将卵子的到来视为一个可怕的预兆，这肯定与预言有关，但它们对真正的危险视而不见。他们继续做着被提亚马特谴责的事情。他们等待和观察，希望通过观察和反思预言来了解这些新龙血的真正性质。",

	"The church of Tiamat has since managed to spread spawn throughout the Old Empires and beyond. Many lurk in dark corners of the world, roaming swamps, jungles, and caverns as they hunt their prey and wait for the call to join Tiamat's army. Some have allied themselves with the Cult of the Dragon, though that group's goals never take precedence over serving the will of Tiamat..": "此后，提亚马特的教会设法在整个旧帝国和其他地区传播卵子。许多人潜伏在世界的黑暗角落里，在沼泽、丛林和洞穴中游荡，他们猎杀猎物，等待加入提亚马特军队的召唤。有些人已经与龙的崇拜结盟，尽管该组织的目标从未优先于服务提亚马特的意志。",

	"Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a fundamental principle, such as \"The guilty should be punished,\" \"Bargains should be kept,\" or \"Everyone dies eventually.\" When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using spells like {@spell geas} to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. If unable to cross an ocean any other way, inevitables have been known to walk into the waves, traversing the seabed to emerge on another continent months later.": "每种类型的 \"必然 \"都被设计用来寻找和惩罚一种特定的违法行为，追捕违反基本原则的人或团体，例如 \"有罪的人应该受到惩罚\"，\"应该遵守交易\"，或者 \"每个人最终都会死亡\"。当一个不可避免的人被创造出来时，它就会接受它的第一个任务，然后找到违法者并实施适当的惩罚。判决通常是死亡，尽管有些不可避免者坚持要求对被害方进行赔偿，并使用{@spell geas}等法术来确保遵守。从第一步开始，不可避免者就完全专注于其目标。它继续努力，不管这条线索有多冷，任务有多无望。如果无法以其他方式穿越海洋，不可避免者就会走进海浪，穿越海床，几个月后出现在另一块大陆上。",
	"Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming. Even the most effective inevitables are periodically recalled to Mechanus for reprogramming.": "Inevitables一心一意地追捕他们的猎物，但他们接到的命令是不要伤害无辜者。然而，他们的猎物的帮凶是公平的，这有时会在他们的程序中产生冲突。即使是最有效的不可避免者也会定期被召回到麦格纳斯进行重新编程。",
	"Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long. It's apparent to anyone who spends much time with one that an inevitable would sacrifice an ally to fulfill its purpose without a second thought.": "不可避免的人乐意牺牲自己来完成任务，但他们并不是自杀式的。面对即将到来的失败，他们很可能会撤退，并寻求一种扳回局面的方法。他们是坚定但有耐心的敌人。如果有助于完成他们的任务，他们会与其他人结盟，但他们很难长期保持盟友。任何与之相处时间较长的人都会发现，不可避免地会牺牲一个盟友来实现自己的目的，而不假思索。",
	"When an inevitable completes its task, it wanders the landscape and passively observes life around it. When it discerns another transgression of the principle it is dedicated to, it has a new mission. Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Those in the know who hear about a 12-foot-tall, golden-armored statue roaming the countryside might seek out the inevitable and present a case, hoping it will take on the alleged transgressor. The decision is based on the idiosyncrasies of the inevitable's programming, so there's no guarantee.": "当一个不可避免的人完成了它的任务，它就会在风景中徘徊，被动地观察周围的生活。当它发现另一个违反它所致力于的原则的行为时，它就有了新的任务。当它处于观察模式时，不可避免者往往会在人群中显眼，但它们似乎对人们的关注视而不见。那些知情者听说有一个12英尺高的金甲雕像在乡间游荡，可能会寻找不可避免者，并提出一个案例，希望它能对所谓的违法者采取行动。这个决定是基于不可避免的程序的特异性，所以没有任何保证。",

	"Based on the experience of myself and others when running certain monsters, I find that keeping track of auras (such as {@creature Gorguth|EdE}'s Aura of Annihilation and Death Gaze) is very tedious and easy to forget. This happens because such an aura typically takes when another creature starts (or ends) its turn within a certain range of the aura's origin.

	"The issue I face is two-fold: first, official monsters already work this way, so for me to go against it could potentially be confusing to DMs that are already used to it. Second, as auras are constantly emanating, it makes sense that they take effect on every creatures' turns; other solutions contradict this logic by allowing creatures to pass through them without necessarily being affected.": "我面临的问题有两个：首先，官方的怪物已经这样工作了，所以我违背了这一点，有可能会让已经习惯了它的管理员感到困惑。第二，由于光环是不断发出的，因此在每个生物的回合中生效是合理的；其他解决方案与这一逻辑相矛盾，它们允许生物穿过光环而不一定受到影响。",
	"With that in mind, I still present to you this variant: rather than having an aura affect creatures at the start of their turns, have them affect creatures at the start of the aura emanator's turn. This may require some reflavoring - for example, a Negative Energy Aura would be flavored as a periodic burst of negative energy coming from an {@creature atropal|ToA}, rather than being a constant sphere around the atropal. However, this solution can drastically speed up your game; not to mention, your game being bogged down is probably even more immersion breaking than an aura that is ran using this variant.": "考虑到这一点，我仍然向你们介绍这个变体：与其让光环在生物的回合开始时影响它们，不如让它们在光环发出者的回合开始时影响生物。这可能需要重新调味--例如，负能量光环将被调味为来自（%0%）的周期性负能量爆发，而不是围绕阿托帕尔的恒定球体。然而，这个解决方案可以大大加快你的游戏速度；更不用说，你的游戏陷入困境可能比使用这种变体运行的光环更容易破坏沉浸感。",

Buried in the deepest bowels of the Underdark, hidden in the farthest reaches of the multiverse, or lost in the gulfs between realities are terrible things that exist only to destroy or horribly remake creation. So mighty are these ancient beings that even the gods think twice about standing against them. Mortals who are aware of their existence viciously suppress that knowledge and destroy any who would serve such things. Even if an elder evil can be forced back to whence it came, its mere presence changes the world forever. In short, it is a campaign ender.": "当古老的邪恶在蠢蠢欲动时，世界在呻吟；当它们觉醒时，世界在哭泣。埋藏在暗黑世界的最深处，隐藏在多元宇宙的最远处，或者迷失在现实之间的沟壑中，这些可怕的东西只为毁灭或可怕地重塑创造而存在。这些古老的生命是如此强大，甚至连诸神都要三思而后行。意识到它们存在的凡人会恶毒地压制这种知识，并摧毁任何为这种东西服务的人。即使一个古老的恶魔可以被逼回它的来处，它的存在也会永远改变世界。简而言之，它是一个运动的终结者。",

	"{@b Chapter 9. The Worm that Walks:} This elder evil is the memory of a slain corporeal god. Its essence transferred itself to the worms and maggots that devoured the deity's corpse, forming a hideous but vaguely humanoid shape.

Gods create and attend their creations; elder evils unravel them.": "长者的邪恶潜伏在生存的边缘。他们一直存在，也将一直存在。虽然他们可以像半神一样强大，有时甚至更强大，但他们并不是神灵。他们对凡人不感兴趣，除了要把他们消灭掉。神明创造并关注他们的创造物；长老的邪恶则解开它们。",
	"The mere presence of an elder evil threatens reality. Such power is difficult to conceal. If the party hasn't heard even a whisper of the entity to date, why and how has it masked its presence? Uncovering this mystery can be as thrilling a challenge as the final confrontation itself.": "仅仅是一个长者邪恶的存在就会威胁到现实。这样的力量是难以掩盖的。如果到目前为止，党派还没有听到这个实体的哪怕是一个耳语，那么它为什么以及如何掩盖其存在？揭开这个谜团可能和最后的对抗本身一样是一个惊心动魄的挑战。",
	"The secrecy of an elder evil depends on your needs as the Dungeon Master. If you're starting a new campaign and plan to end it in a confrontation with a world-threatening entity, plant the seeds early and drop hints over time. If you've decided recently to bring things to a head, there's nothing wrong with suddenly revealing the elder evil.": "长老邪恶的保密性取决于你作为地下城主的需要。如果你正在开始一个新的战役，并计划在与一个威胁世界的实体的对抗中结束它，那么尽早埋下种子，并随着时间的推移留下暗示。如果你最近决定要把事情进行到底，那么突然透露出长老级的邪恶是没有问题的。",
	"When introducing these terrifying entities into an established campaign, use what you already have. Recurring villains or their minions work well when the party already has an inkling of the nemesis. For example, when the nefarious high priest of Nerull reveals that she is in fact an accomplice of the Worm that Walks (see Chapter 9), the revelation is as logical as it is horrifying. On the other hand, a major campaign villain might turn out to be the elder evil itself. Faceless, recurring villains hide their identities behind several masks; as the campaign develops, the party exposes (or believe they expose) their true enemy again and again until you're ready to reveal the ultimate truth.": "在将这些可怕的实体引入已建立的活动中时，要利用你已有的东西。当党派已经对克星有了一定的了解时，反复出现的恶棍或他们的爪牙就会很有效。例如，当邪恶的内鲁尔（Nerull）大祭司透露她实际上是行走的虫子（见第9章）的帮凶时，这个启示既符合逻辑又令人恐惧。另一方面，一个主要的活动反派可能会被证明是长者的邪恶。无脸的、反复出现的反派人物把他们的身份隐藏在几个面具后面；随着战役的发展，党派一次又一次地暴露（或相信他们暴露了）他们真正的敌人，直到你准备揭示最终的真相。",
	"Each of the chapters of the original book describes an elder evil, its motivations and servants, and signs of its approach, as well as providing a sample story arc to help you introduce the threat into your campaign. A given entry uses the format below.": "原书的每一章都描述了一个长老的邪恶，它的动机和仆人，以及它接近的迹象，同时还提供了一个故事弧的样本，以帮助你将威胁引入你的战役中。一个特定的条目使用以下格式。",
	"This section opens with a paragraph of common knowledge and continues with several paragraphs of specialized knowledge. Learning one of these pieces of information about an elder evil requires an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check, as listed in the original book. While the DC of each check remains up to the DM, they should range from Moderate (DC 15) to Nearly Impossible (DC 30). Alternatively, the DM may decide that this information cannot be acquired except through certain methods of research or interaction with the campaign world.": "本节以一段常识开篇，接着是几段专门的知识。学习这些关于长者邪恶的信息之一需要进行智力（（%0%））或智力（（%1%））检查，如原书中所列。虽然每个检查的DC由DM决定，但它们的范围应该是从中等（DC 15）到几乎不可能（DC 30）。或者，DM可以决定，除非通过某些研究方法或与活动世界的互动，否则无法获得这些信息。",
	"This section follows the same format as the Background entry, but the lore entries reveal ever more secret details of the elder evil's ultimate purpose.": "这一部分遵循与背景条目相同的格式，但传说条目揭示了关于长老邪恶的最终目的的更多秘密细节。",
	"This section sets out a sample story arc with increasingly difficult challenges, culminating in the final confrontation with the elder evil. The Suggested Party Level (SPL) of these challenges correspond with strengthening signs of the apocalypse, as detailed later in this chapter. Each chapter includes a section that describes the game effects of that elder evil's sign.": "本节列出了一个故事弧的样本，其中的挑战难度越来越大，最后是与长老的邪恶对抗。这些挑战的建议等级（SPL）与加强的天启征兆相对应，详见本章后面的内容。每一章都有一节描述了该长老邪恶征兆的游戏效果。",
	"Two subsections suggest ways to adapt the elder evil to the {@i Forgotten Realms}® and {@i Eberron}™ campaign settings.": "有两个小节提出了使长者之恶适应{@i Forgotten Realms}®和{@i Eberron}™运动设置的方法。",
	"This subsection presents an original variant on how an elder evil might fit in a unique campaign setting, or it may present alternate plot hooks or story details to be used as appropriate.": "本小节介绍了一个关于长老级恶魔如何适合独特的战役背景的原创变体，或者它可能提出替代的情节钩子或故事细节，以酌情使用。",
	"You can adapt any of the example elder evils in this book so that they fit better into your setting's history. For example, planar campaigns or campaigns that use Spelljammers might wish to change the default locations given in the original book to better fit the setting they are a part of.": "你可以改编本书中的任何一个长老邪恶的例子，使其更适合你的设定的历史。例如，平面战役或使用咒语者的战役可能希望改变原书中给出的默认地点，以更好地适应他们所处的环境。",
	"Here follow physical details of the elder evil. Important servants and minions are also presented in this section, along with their statistics.": "下面是长老邪恶的身体细节。本节还介绍了重要的仆人和奴仆，以及他们的统计数据。",
	"Each entry has an overview map of the area in which the final confrontation occurs. Specific encounter areas are described in narrative, and a few are tied to tactical encounters at the end of the chapter.": "每个条目都有一张最终对抗发生区域的概览地图。具体的遭遇区域在叙述中进行了描述，有几个在章节末尾与战术遭遇联系在一起。",
	"Each tactical encounter includes a map of the room or area in which it takes place. The information includes creature statistics and tactics, initial positions of combatants, the locations of traps or other hazards, and other details important to the encounter.": "每个战术遭遇战都包括一个房间或区域的地图，它发生在那里。这些信息包括生物的统计数据和战术，战斗人员的初始位置，陷阱或其他危险的位置，以及对遭遇战重要的其他细节。",
	"An elder evil, or its mortal minions, might be active through the life of the campaign, but only when the horror awakens, arrives, or sets its plans in motion does the world know of it. This awakening manifests as a sign: the physical, magical, or psychological imprint of the elder evil. A sign reflects an aspect of the being's purpose and nature, and it influences the entire campaign setting. Sometimes it appears not by the will of the entity itself (which would rather not tip its hand), but as a warning from the gods, who are often constrained from direct involvement.": "一个年长的邪恶，或者它的凡人爪牙，可能在整个活动期间都是活跃的，但只有当这个恐怖的东西觉醒、到来，或者启动它的计划时，世界才知道它的存在。这种觉醒表现为一种征兆：长者邪恶的身体、魔法或心理上的印记。征兆反映了该生物的目的和性质的一个方面，它影响了整个活动的设置。有时，它的出现并不是出于实体本身的意愿（它宁可不出手），而是作为来自诸神的警告，而诸神往往被限制住，不能直接参与。",
	"When adjudicating a sign's influence, describe in flavorful narrative how it alters the world around the party. (Refer to the quotations that introduce each sign for inspiration to guide your story.)": "在评判一个标志的影响力时，用生动的叙述来描述它是如何改变当事人周围的世界的。(参考介绍每个标志的语录，以获得指导你故事的灵感）。",
	"After a sign appears and gains strength, its effect can be nearly as devastating as the elder evil itself; even if the threat is dealt with, this lingering influence leaves the world a much different place. Since signs have such widespread effects, handling them within the context of the game can be daunting. The sample story arcs in the following chapters suggest ways to heighten a given sign gradually over time. When it finally becomes overwhelming—heralding the imminent arrival of the threat—the party's average level should be high enough to resist all but the worst effects.": "在一个征兆出现并获得力量之后，它的影响几乎可以和长者的邪恶本身一样具有破坏性；即使威胁被解决了，这种挥之不去的影响也会使世界变得更加不同。由于征兆具有如此广泛的影响，在游戏的背景下处理它们可能是令人生畏的。下面几章中的故事样板暗示了随着时间的推移逐渐加强一个特定标志的方法。当它最终变得不堪一击时--预示着威胁即将到来--当事人的平均水平应该足够高，可以抵御除最坏影响之外的所有影响。",
	"To ordinary mortals, the appearance of a sign is a mysterious phenomenon—foreboding and sinister, to be sure, but without obvious significance. Only individuals who have the proper training and experience, who are steeped in ancient or forbidden knowledge, have any chance to recognize its grim implications.": "对普通人来说，征兆的出现是一种神秘的现象--肯定是不祥和的，但没有明显的意义。只有那些受过适当训练和有经验的人，那些沉浸在古代或禁忌知识中的人，才有机会认识到其严峻的含义。",
	"To identify a sign for what it is, a character must succeed on an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check, as appropriate. The check DC depends on the sign's intensity, as set out in the following table. As the effect of the sign becomes more pervasive, its meaning grows ever more clear. A faint sign might be simply unsettling, but at its height, its influence is inescapable.": "要辨别一个标志是什么，一个角色必须成功地进行智力（（%0%））或智力（（%1%））检查，根据情况而定。检查DC取决于标志的强度，如下表所示。随着标志的效果越来越普遍，它的意义也越来越清晰。一个微弱的征兆可能只是让人不安，但在它的高度，它的影响是不可避免的。",
	"Faint": "淡淡的",
	"Moderate": "中等水平",
	"Strong": "强大的",
	"Overwhelming": "压倒性的",
	"By succeeding on this check, a character knows the sign is an evil omen. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can identify the sign's strength, and succeeding by 10 or more reveals all the ramifications of its effect (including the identity of the elder evil).": "通过这个检查的成功，一个角色知道这个标志是一个邪恶的预兆。如果检定成功5个或更多，该角色可以识别该标志的强度，而成功10个或更多，则揭示其效果的所有后果（包括长者的身份）。",
	"The following signs are examples of those that could accompany an elder evil's approach; you might prefer to design your own, taking inspiration from these entries. Each section describes the effect of the sign at the four intensities listed above.": "下面的标志是可以伴随着长者邪恶的方法的例子；你可能更愿意从这些条目中获得灵感，设计你自己的标志。每一节都描述了该标志在上述四种强度下的效果。",

	"The pale disk of silver hanging in the night sky transforms, assuming a ghastly hue. At first, it darkens to an orange tone like that of a harvest moon, but as the sign approaches its peak, it turns the color of blood.": "悬挂在夜空中的苍白银盘发生了变化，呈现出一种可怕的色调。起初，它变暗为橙色，就像收获的月亮一样，但当这个标志接近它的峰值时，它变成了血的颜色。",
	"{@b Effect:} The sign of the blood moon sets tempers on edge, making living creatures irritable and aggressive. Ultimately, they are consumed by involuntary rage.": "{@b Effect:}血月的标志使脾气暴躁，使生物变得易怒和具有攻击性。最终，他们会被不由自主的愤怒所吞噬。",

	"When this sign appears, the light dies. The days grow shorter, and temperatures drop until finally the sun vanishes from the sky, plunging the world into perpetual night.": "当这个标志出现时，光线就会消失。白天越来越短，气温下降，直到最后太阳从天空消失，世界陷入永久的黑夜。",
	"{@b Effect:} Natural and magical lighting diminish as the sign strengthens, until the sun no longer rises.": "{@b Effect:}自然和魔法照明随着标志的加强而减少，直到太阳不再升起。",
	"{@b Details:} Father Llymic is associated with this sign. See Chapter 3 for more information.": "{@b Details:}父亲Llymic与这个星座有关。更多信息见第三章。",
	"{@b Variant:} Instead of the sun disappearing completely, planetary rotation slows so that, ultimately, one side of the world is bathed in perpetual light while the other is plunged into eternal darkness. The effects of the sign on the dark side function as normal. On the light side, the effects are reversed: The range of natural light sources doubles; sunrise occurs earlier and sunset later; spells that produce darkness are impeded and light-producing spells are enhanced. Finally, global average temperatures climb rather than drop. The glaring light and heat are as great a disaster as endless dark, ultimately rendering the light side a lifeless ruin.": "{@b Variant:}太阳并没有完全消失，而是行星自转变慢，因此，最终，世界的一边沐浴在永恒的光亮中，而另一边则陷入永恒的黑暗中。黑暗面的标志的影响如常运作。在光明的一面，影响则相反：自然光源的范围增加了一倍；日出时间提前，日落时间推迟；产生黑暗的法术受到阻碍，产生光明的法术得到加强。最后，全球平均气温不降反升。耀眼的光和热与无尽的黑暗一样是巨大的灾难，最终使光明面成为无生命的废墟。",
	"Frogs fell from the sky for hours. The next day, flaming stones showered us, killing all they touched. Then it snowed for three weeks. Who knows what's next?": "青蛙从天而降，持续数小时。第二天，燃烧的石头向我们袭来，杀死了所有它们接触到的东西。然后下了三个星期的雪。谁知道接下来会发生什么？",
	"This sign alters the weather in drastic and unnatural ways. Snow in the summer and sweltering heat in the winter are just the beginning. Hurricanes lash the coastlines, destroy villages, or flood entire cities; tornadoes rip apart the countryside; and bizarre weather effects become commonplace. All the while, sickening green clouds form, and violet lightning dances between them.": "这个标志以急剧和非自然的方式改变了天气。夏天的雪和冬天的酷热仅仅是个开始。飓风袭击海岸线，摧毁村庄，或淹没整个城市；龙卷风撕裂了乡村；怪异的天气效应变得司空见惯。与此同时，令人作呕的绿色云层形成，紫色的闪电在云层之间飞舞。",
	"{@b Effect:} When this sign manifests, it creates strange and random meteorological effects. The intensity of the sign determines the extent, duration, and frequency of the unusual weather.": "{@b Effect:}当这个星座表现出来的时候，它会产生奇怪和随机的气象效应。该星座的强度决定了异常天气的范围、持续时间和频率。",

	"{@b Effect:} The type of infestation depends on the nature of the elder evil. Aberrations, animals, plants, oozes, undead, and vermin are typical choices, though some magical beasts, outsiders, and even humanoids could work too. As the sign grows in strength, so too do the numbers, increasing the challenge of the encounter. The creatures spread throughout the campaign setting as the sign grows stronger, and encounters range from single fights to desperate stands against vast armies.": "{@b Effect:} 侵扰的类型取决于长老邪恶的性质。畸形、动物、植物、渗虫、亡灵和害虫是典型的选择，尽管一些魔兽、外来者，甚至是人类也可以。随着信号的增强，数量也在增加，增加了遭遇战的挑战。随着征兆的增强，生物会遍布整个战役环境，而遭遇的范围也从单一的战斗到不顾一切地对抗大军。",

	"When this sign appears, the demarcation between life and death grows ever more blurry. After souls depart, their bodies stir in a wretched existence neither alive nor dead. The sign of the restless dead first makes itself known by isolated occurrences of zombies and skeletons in the community. As it strengthens, the undead plague increases. Corpses pull themselves free from graves, slaughtering former friends and lovers and swelling their ranks until only the shuffling dead remain.": "当这个标志出现时，生与死的分界线就变得越来越模糊。灵魂离开后，他们的身体在一种既不活也不死的悲惨生活中搅动。不安的死人征兆首先通过社区中孤立出现的僵尸和骷髅而为人所知。随着它的加强，亡灵瘟疫也在增加。尸体从坟墓中挣脱出来，屠杀以前的朋友和恋人，扩大他们的队伍，直到只剩下摇摇欲坠的死者。",
	"{@b Effect:} In the early stages of this sign, only a few of the dead spontaneously animate. Necromancy magic becomes more efficacious, while healing magic is suppressed. As the sign intensifies, more and more corpses rise, growing stronger all the while.": "{@b Effect:} 在这个征兆的早期阶段，只有少数死者会自发地活过来。亡灵魔法变得更加有效，而治疗魔法则受到抑制。随着征兆的加强，越来越多的尸体复活，同时越来越强大。",

	"{@b Effect:} The seal of binding interferes with most conjuration spells and many divination spells by closing off the avenues that enable mortals to interact with the planes. Clerics' connections with the divine are severed, summoned creatures do not return to their home planes, and dimensional travel ceases to function.": "{@b Effect:} 捆绑之印通过关闭使凡人能够与位面互动的途径，干扰了大多数魔法咒语和许多占卜咒语。牧师与神灵的联系被切断，被召唤的生物不能回到他们的主位面，维度旅行也停止运作。",

	"This sign first manifests with accelerated healing. Soon, though, living creatures and inanimate objects become covered with festering boils, which burst to expel swarms of pests. Not long after this boon comes a light rain of spores, dotting the landscape with foul growths that spawn horrid abominations and spread corruption across the land. As the sign strengthens, wounds close almost instantly, but flesh grows pustulent and bones distend as life becomes corrupted. At its peak, all undead but the most powerful and hidden are obliterated. The dead rise as gibbering aberrations, and the living mutate into twisted progeny.": "这个征兆首先表现为加速愈合。但很快，生物和无生命的物体就会被溃烂的疖子覆盖，这些疖子爆裂后会排出成群的害虫。在这一好处之后不久，就下起了孢子的小雨，在风景中点缀着肮脏的生长物，产生可怕的憎恶，并在整个土地上传播腐败。随着征兆的加强，伤口几乎立即愈合，但随着生命的堕落，肉体逐渐化脓，骨骼膨胀。在它的巅峰时期，除了最强大和最隐蔽的亡灵，所有的亡灵都会被消灭。死者复活为胡言乱语的畸形人，而活人则变异为扭曲的后代。",

	"The peasants believed they had been blessed: Their crops grew quickly, women bore healthy children in weeks rather than months, and the harvest was the best ever. At first, life was good. But the growth never slowed. Everything birthed and died with such speed that we could hear Nature suffering. Disease was rampant, and vermin spread it everywhere; there was no end to the screams of the afflicted.": "农民们相信他们得到了祝福。他们的庄稼长得很快，妇女在几周而不是几个月内就能生出健康的孩子，而且收获是有史以来最好的。起初，生活很好。但增长从未放缓。一切都以如此快的速度诞生和死亡，我们可以听到大自然的痛苦。疾病猖獗，害虫到处传播；受折磨的人的尖叫声不绝于耳。",
	"Growth and healing are accelerated. At first crops and animals grow and reproduce with unnatural swiftness, and injuries vanish overnight.

	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} The priests contact the party once more. Having deciphered the old tome, the clerics suspect whoever sought the book intends to summon the World Born Dead. The manuscript offers few details, and the clerics have been unable to elicit any concrete answers from their god. They do uncover the name of another tome: The {@item book of vile darkness}. They ask the characters to locate this book before their enemy uncovers it. The party must research and follow up on leads to find its resting place, all the while facing innumerable cultists who seek the same end. To make matters worse, the party hears reports from all over about how the dead have begun to rise from their graves.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} 牧师们再次联系党。在破译了这本古老的书之后，牧师们怀疑寻求这本书的人打算召唤出世界上的亡灵。手稿提供的细节很少，神职人员也无法从他们的神那里得到任何具体的答案。他们确实发现了另一本手稿的名字。{@item book of vile darkness}。他们要求人物在他们的敌人发现这本书之前找到它。队伍必须研究并追踪线索以找到它的藏身之处，同时还要面对无数寻求相同目的的邪教分子。更糟糕的是，他们听到了来自各地的报告，说死者已经开始从坟墓中复活。",
	"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} Sensing an opportunity to make a decisive strike against his ancient enemy, Orcus dispatches his legions, led by a bodak named Gorguth, to invade Demogorgon's layer, the Gaping Maw. This strike plunges the Abyss into widespread war, with demon lords and princes lining up against one another to settle old scores. The Dark Eight of the Nine Hells perceive this infighting as a weakness and for the first time mount a successful invasion into the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. During the interplanar wars, Gorguth forswears his allegiance to Orcus and leads his undead armies into the Material Plane through a {@spell gate} created by cultists in the service of Atropus.": "{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):}感觉到有机会对他古老的敌人进行决定性的打击，奥库斯派遣他的军团，在一个名叫戈尔古斯的波达克的带领下，入侵德摩戈根的层，大嘴。这次袭击使深渊陷入了广泛的战争，恶魔领主和王子们相互排挤，以解决旧账。九层地狱的黑暗八人组将这种内讧视为一种弱点，并首次成功入侵深渊的无限层。在星际战争中，戈尔古斯放弃了对奥库斯的效忠，带领他的亡灵军队通过一个由为阿特罗普斯服务的邪教徒创造的{@spell gate}进入物质界。",
	"Meanwhile, Caira recovers the {@item book of vile darkness} and learns that the elder evil will come if a tragedy of terrible and widespread death were to occur. She researches the {@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE} spell, during which time she sends out her minions to collect a sample of angel tears she intends to use to complete the casting of the spell. The party might be drawn into the fighting on the planes, join the battle against Gorguth, or follow up their leads about Caira.": "与此同时，凯拉找回了{@item book of vile darkness}，并了解到如果发生可怕的大面积死亡的悲剧，长者的邪恶就会降临。她研究了{@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE}的法术，在此期间，她派出了她的部下去收集天使之泪的样本，她打算用它来完成施法。党派可能会被卷入平面上的战斗，加入对戈尔古斯的战斗，或者追踪他们关于凯拉的线索。",
	"{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} The undead outnumber the living, spreading like a cancer. Gorguth's armies beat back the defenders, filling their depleted ranks by turning their fallen adversaries into undead. Gorguth marches toward the metropolis where he intends to greet the elder evil when it arrives. Meanwhile, Caira completes her research and begins the daylong casting from her hidden base beneath the city. From one of her captured minions or another ally they met along the way, the party learns of her horrible plan and must decide whether they will stand against the fast-approaching undead army or seek out the ur-priest in the hope of halting her fell magic.": "{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} 亡灵的数量超过了活人，像癌症一样蔓延开来。高古特的军队击退了守军，通过把倒下的对手变成亡灵来填补他们枯竭的队伍。高尔基斯向大都市进军，他打算在那里迎接邪恶老人的到来。与此同时，凯拉完成了她的研究，并开始从她隐藏在城市下面的基地进行为期一天的铸造。从她俘虏的一个爪牙或沿途遇到的另一个盟友那里，一行人得知了她的可怕计划，他们必须决定是要对抗快速逼近的亡灵大军，还是要找寻乌尔牧师，希望能阻止她的堕落魔法。",

Alternatively, if the party faced Gorguth and defeated it, Caira completes the spell and bathes everything in a 100-mile radius with fiery death, killing tens of thousands. This calamity is enough to awaken Atropus, and the moonlet begins to descend toward the planet. Surviving spellcasters cast {@spell gate} spells to transport people to the Plane of Shadow, trying to save as many as they can, leaving the party as the world's last chance to stop Atropus. They must travel to the moonlet, brave the void, and find and defeat the aspect of Atropus before the moonlet reaches the planet's surface.": "{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):}如果党派阻止了凯拉，这只是短暂的胜利，因为戈尔古斯接近了，他的成群的恶魔和亡灵涌入城市，将死亡和破坏扩散到整个城市。另外，如果党派面对戈尔古斯并将其击败，凯拉就会完成咒语，用火热的死亡沐浴方圆100英里内的一切，杀死数万人。这场灾难足以唤醒阿特罗普斯，而小月球开始向地球降落。幸存的施法者施展{@spell gate}的法术，将人们传送到影子世界，试图尽可能多地拯救他们，留下党作为世界上阻止阿特罗普斯的最后机会。他们必须前往小月球，勇敢面对虚空，并在小月球到达地球表面之前找到并击败阿特罗普斯的一面。",
	"Given the elusive character of the gods in the Eberron setting, it is not clear what or who Atropus is. The oldest mentions of this entity date back to the Age of Demons, marking Atropus's appearance during the climactic sacrifice of the couatls in their attempt to rid their world of the demons and force them to their native plane. In the millennia that followed, astronomers have commented on the passage of an anomalous comet that seems to appear whenever Dolurrh, Realm of the Dead, is coterminous with the Material Plane. Some theorize this comet is in fact Atropus of legend, and one day the World Born Dead will visit Eberron again.": "鉴于Eberron设定中诸神的难以捉摸的特性，我们并不清楚阿特罗普斯是什么或谁。关于这个实体的最古老的记载可以追溯到恶魔时代，标志着阿特罗普斯在库阿特尔人试图摆脱他们的世界并迫使他们回到自己的星球的高潮祭祀中出现。在随后的几千年里，天文学家们对一颗异常的彗星的通过进行了评论，这颗彗星似乎在死神之域多鲁尔与物质世界相接的时候出现。有些人认为这颗彗星其实就是传说中的阿特罗普斯，有一天，生而为人的亡灵世界会再次访问埃伯龙。",
	"Outside of the dragons peering into the heavens to divine the future, few comprehend the significance of the movements of the celestial bodies. If mortals knew the evil far above their heads, they would quake in their boots and seek refuge in the bowels of the earth. Indeed, only the Argonnessen dragons know what doom awaits them all, for they have identified a celestial object whose appearance occurred at the same time that Cyre became the Mournland. It is an odd thing moving through the Ring of Siberys. Some suspect magical manifestation, maybe a planar anomaly, but a few know the truth, and they do their best to push such thoughts from their minds, lest they draw its attention by dwelling on what many believe is the inevitable end of the world.": "除了那些窥视天堂以预知未来的龙之外，很少有人能理解天体运动的意义。如果凡人知道他们头顶上的邪恶，他们就会颤抖不已，在地底寻求庇护。事实上，只有Argonnessen龙知道等待他们所有人的是什么厄运，因为他们已经确定了一个天体，其出现的时间与赛尔城成为哀牢地的时间相同。这是一个奇怪的东西，在西伯利亚之环中移动。有些人怀疑是魔法的表现，也许是一个平面异常，但也有少数人知道真相，他们尽力把这种想法从脑海中推开，以免他们因纠缠于许多人认为是不可避免的世界末日而引起它的注意。",
	"Those few sages who even know of Atropus debate the origins of this elder evil. They agree that Atropus was spawned when Ao created the first gods, but where they differ is in how Atropus was formed. Some claim the elder evil gained awareness from the divine amniotic fluid surrounding the first god of death, while others claim Atropus was the last god Ao created, but it was stillborn. Atropus has never come close to Faerûn, but those aware of it are ever watchful of the heavens, waiting for the day when the moonlet circles the tapestry of night.": "少数知道阿特罗普斯的圣人对这位长者的邪恶的起源进行了辩论。他们一致认为阿特罗普斯是在奥创造第一批神时产生的，但他们的分歧在于阿特罗普斯是如何形成的。有些人声称这个长老级恶魔从围绕着第一个死神的神圣羊水中获得了意识，而其他人则声称阿特罗普斯是敖创造的最后一个神，但它是死胎。阿特罗普斯从未接近过法鲁恩，但那些意识到它的人一直在监视着天堂，等待着小月亮绕过黑夜织锦的那一天。",
	"The moonlet is one of the drifting bodies forming the ring around the dull gray planet known as Glyth, one of the Five Wanderers that do not follow the ordinary paths of the stars. Little do the mortals of Faerûn realize the cataclysm affecting this distant world. Drawn by the widespread death and destruction meted out by mind flayer overlords, Atropus drew close, masking its approach behind the belt of debris forming the ring around the planet. While the illithids waged their interminable wars against the native humanoids, Atropus descended and wiped out all life, leaving Glyth an empty husk. Now Atropus turns its attention to Faerûn and begins its slide toward a world ripe for the taking": "这颗小月球是形成环形的漂流体之一，围绕着被称为Glyth的暗灰色星球，是不遵循普通星轨的五个流浪者中的一个。Faerûn的凡人很少意识到影响这个遥远世界的大灾变。被弑神者的大范围死亡和破坏所吸引，阿特罗普斯接近了，并将它的接近掩盖在形成行星周围环形的碎片带后面。当illithids对本地人类发动无休止的战争时，Atropus降临并消灭了所有的生命，留下Glyth一个空壳。现在，Atropus将注意力转向了Faerûn，并开始向一个成熟的世界滑去。",
	"Instead of constraining Atropus to be a leftover creation of the overgod Ao, a DM may wish to relate Atropus to Ao in a more equal manner, or they may wish to remove Ao from the setting altogether. In the latter case, use the default lore provided in the Background section to explain Atropus's origins.": "与其将阿特罗普斯限制为超神奥的遗留物，DM可能希望以更平等的方式将阿特罗普斯与奥联系起来，或者他们可能希望将奥从设定中完全删除。在后一种情况下，使用背景部分提供的默认传说来解释阿特罗普斯的起源。",
	"Rather than being free to roam the Material Plane, Atropus could languish in stasis on the Negative Energy Plane. Once released, it might seek to transform all the Outer Planes into a mass graveyard. In this case, the Restless Dead sign could represent Atropus drawing nearer to a given plane, intensifying until Atropus is able to enter the plane.": "阿特罗普斯不是自由地在物质界游荡，而是在负能量位面静止不动地等待。一旦被释放，它可能会寻求将所有外层世界变成一个集体墓地。在这种情况下，无休止的死亡征兆可能代表阿特罗普斯正在接近某个特定的平面，并不断加强，直到阿特罗普斯能够进入该平面。",
	"The default Sign of Apocalypse for Atropus is certainly a major effect in your campaign world, but some may find it unsatisfying that the Sign is a passive effect that is simply a byproduct of Atropus's approach. If you wish to make Atropus feel more like an active threat, allow more powerful undead in service to Atropus to descend from the moonlet to your campaign setting. For example, you can take advantage of Atropus's connection to Atropals to make them effective heralds of the moonlet's approach. As stillborn creatures from the Negative Energy plane, atropals also serve as effective heralds in planar campaigns, acting as forerunners for the much larger threat to come.": "阿特罗普斯的默认天启标志在你的战役世界中当然是一个重要的效果，但有些人可能会觉得不满意，因为这个标志是一个被动的效果，只是阿特罗普斯做法的一个副产品。如果你想让阿特罗普斯感觉更像一个主动的威胁，可以让更多为阿特罗普斯服务的强大的亡灵从月球上降临到你的竞选环境中。例如，你可以利用阿特罗普斯与阿特罗帕斯的联系，让他们成为小月球接近的有效传令者。作为来自负能量位面的静止生物，阿托帕斯在平面战役中也是有效的预言家，为即将到来的更大的威胁充当先驱者。",
	"You can also consider other threats to act as villains in anticipation of Atropus's arrival. For example, while the original outline suggests that Orcus be involved in an interplanar war, you may wish for Orcus himself to beckon Atropus's arrival. In this case, the Bleak General might be a loyal servant of Orcus, rather than betraying him in favor of Atropus. Another villains include Acererak, Lady Illmarrow (and the Order of the Emerald Claw), an aspiring lich or mummy lord, a god of undeath, or a fallen angel or undead celestial. Perhaps even the Worm That Walks (chapter 9) has taken an interest in Atropus, and has decided to ally with the World Born Dead so that it may rule the dead world that Atropus leaves behind.": "你也可以考虑让其他威胁作为反派，以期待阿特罗普斯的到来。例如，虽然原来的大纲建议奥卡斯参与星际战争，但你可能希望奥卡斯本人招来阿特罗普斯的到来。在这种情况下，黯淡将军可能会成为奥卡斯的忠实仆人，而不是背叛他而支持阿特罗普斯。另一个反派包括阿克雷拉克（Acererak）、伊尔马罗夫人（以及翡翠之爪骑士团）、有抱负的巫师或木乃伊领主、不死之神，或堕落的天使或不死天体。甚至可能是 \"会走路的虫子\"（第9章）对阿特罗普斯产生了兴趣，并决定与 \"生生不息的世界 \"结盟，以便统治阿特罗普斯留下的死亡世界。",
	"Additionally, feel free to alter the details as to how Atropus is summoned. The suggested campaign outline gives two ways for Atropus to be summoned: the {@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE} spell, obtained through the {@item book of vile darkness}, or the massacre of a major city by demonic forces. Below are additional possibilities for how Atropus might be summoned:": "此外，请随意修改关于如何召唤阿特罗普斯的细节。建议的活动大纲给出了两种召唤阿特罗普斯的方式：通过{@item book of vile darkness}获得的{@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE}法术，或者恶魔势力对一座大城市的屠杀。以下是阿特罗普斯可能被召唤的其他可能性。",
	"Perhaps a certain artifact or magical object must be destroyed in order to summon Atropus. For example, maybe the {@item book of exalted deeds} can be temporarily destroyed using a {@item talisman of ultimate evil}, the act of which awakens Atropus and draws it towards the setting. Alternatively, perhaps a dimensional seal or a planar barrier prevents Atropus from entering a given plane or approaching a given planet, and if destroyed, the World Born Dead will be free to approach and annihilate it.": "也许为了召唤阿特罗普斯，必须摧毁某件神器或魔法物品。例如，也许{@item book of exalted deeds}可以用{@item talisman of ultimate evil}来暂时摧毁，这个行为会唤醒阿特罗普斯，并把它引向这个环境。或者，也许一个维度封印或一个平面屏障可以阻止阿特罗普斯进入一个特定的平面或接近一个特定的星球，如果被摧毁，世界生灵就会自由地接近并消灭它。",
	"In Eberron, an eldritch machine, as detailed in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, may be used to channel large amounts of negative energy in order to cause mass death, or it may simply be used as a homing beacon that entices Atropus to approach the setting.": "在Eberron，如{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中所详述的那样，长生机可以用来引导大量的负能量，以造成大规模的死亡，或者它可以简单地用作诱导Atropus接近设定的归宿信标。",
	"In a planar setting, cultists of the World Born Dead might perform a ritual to break down the barriers that separate the planes, allowing Atropus to pass through a large planar portal into the target plane.": "在一个平面环境中，\"生而为人 \"的邪教徒可能会举行仪式，打破分隔各平面的屏障，让阿特罗普斯通过一个大型平面门户进入目标平面。",
	"In a Spelljammer campaign, Atropus might be on a set path through the cosmos. If it isn't stopped in time, Atropus might destroy a major planetary hub or a capital of a large civilization.": "在Spelljammer战役中，Atropus可能会在宇宙中走一条固定的路线。如果不及时阻止它，阿特罗普斯可能会摧毁一个主要的行星中心或一个大型文明的首都。",
	"Lastly, feel free to use the {@creature Aspect of Atropus|EdE} in new and creative ways. For example, perhaps cultists seek to summon the Aspect of Atropus directly to their world; if they succeed, the aspect will annihilate them and every other creature in the setting. Perhaps a villain seeks to take advantage of the aspect for their own gain. If they absorb or take control of the aspect somehow, they may gain control of the moonlet, or their consciousness might be merged with the World Born Dead itself. Any villain will recognize that the World Born Dead holds the ultimate power over death and undeath, and that if this can be taken advantage of, they will be unstoppable.": "最后，请自由地以新的和创造性的方式使用（%0%）。例如，也许邪教分子试图将阿特罗普斯之神直接召唤到他们的世界；如果他们成功了，阿特罗普斯之神就会消灭他们和环境中的所有其他生物。也许一个恶棍想利用这个方面来谋取自己的利益。如果他们以某种方式吸收或控制了这个方面，他们可能会获得对小月亮的控制，或者他们的意识可能会与 \"生而为人 \"本身合并。任何恶棍都会认识到，\"生而为人 \"拥有对死亡和不死的终极力量，如果能利用这一点，他们将是不可阻挡的。",

Some died unnatural deaths, while others merely ceased to function, going into a sort of dormancy until conditions would be right for them to thrive. One such entity seemed to have an aversion to light. Although it was paralyzed, some aspect of this creature remained able to send illusory projections, beckoning the unwary to visit his unmoving form. These projections gave Father Llymic his name, since the twisted monstrosity was hidden beneath an illusion of a kindly old man.": "远方世界的生物不遵守自然法则；它们的异类性质对与它们接触的人来说是致命的。然而，世界也会以奇怪的方式影响它们。浩瀚之门的幸存者所做的古老记录指出，一些远界实体不能生活在这个世界上。一些人非正常死亡，而另一些人只是停止了功能，进入了一种休眠状态，直到条件适合他们茁壮成长。一个这样的实体似乎对光有一种厌恶。虽然它瘫痪了，但这个生物的某些方面仍然能够发出虚幻的投影，召唤不小心的人去看他不动的形式。这些投影给了Llymic神父他的名字，因为这个扭曲的怪物被隐藏在一个慈祥的老人的幻觉之下。",
	"Although dormant, Father Llymic still proved deadly. Those fooled by his illusions were soon tainted by his corruption and had to be destroyed. Although exposing him to light caused dormancy, it also caused his form to radiate waves of deadly cold. Soon, sheets of ice began to engulf his body. The elves moved him to a mountaintop, where his chill would not harm anyone and the light of the sun might keep him dormant forever. The few remaining caretaker elves eventually died, and Father Llymic was forgotten.": "虽然处于休眠状态，但Llymic神父仍然被证明是致命的。那些被他的幻觉所迷惑的人很快就被他的腐败所玷污，不得不被摧毁。虽然将他暴露在光线下会导致休眠，但也会使他的身体散发出致命的寒气。很快，冰片开始吞噬他的身体。精灵们把他移到一个山顶上，在那里他的寒气不会伤害任何人，太阳的光芒可能会让他永远休眠。剩下的几个看守精灵最终都死了，Llymic神父也被遗忘了。",
	"Legends about Father Llymic grow vague beyond the confines of his mountain prison.

Only the most thorough chronicler might notice that one mountain in particular is full of strange tales regarding missing travelers and reclusive natives. The obvious sign of Father Llymic's coming—the darkening of the sun—means that it is almost too late to stop him from waking.": "由于他潜伏在这样一个荒凉的地方，这位长者的邪恶很容易被添加到任何活动中。只有当Llymic神父接近他的全部力量时，效果才会变得明显，因为太阳开始失去遏制他的力量。地形很容易隐藏他的孩子，旅行者和偏远山区的部族一直在失踪。只有最彻底的编年史家才会注意到，有一座山特别充满了关于失踪的旅行者和隐居的当地人的奇怪故事。Llymic神父到来的明显迹象--太阳变暗--意味着要阻止他醒来几乎已经太晚。",

Headed by Tierad Rynesten, the adventuresome daughter of a nobleman, the caravan left three weeks ago but has not been heard from since. Tierad's father seeks out adventurers to track down the caravan and rescue his daughter. Unfortunately for Tierad, he ran afoul of a tribe of barbarians living in the mountain—a tribe that secretly venerates the frozen god that dwells on the peak. Although many of the drovers have been sacrificed or eaten, some remain to be taken to Father Llymic for his blessed touch. If the party frees Tierad, she tells them of the strange rituals practiced by the barbarians and the way that sometimes they would change, taking on inhuman icy features before leaving the tribe forever. This plot can be set in any city that has a large mountain and other villages nearby. Ideally, the party worked for Tierad's father in the past, making them the logical choice for his call for aid.": "{@b SPL 6:} 整个商队在穿越附近的山口时失踪了。这支商队由一个贵族的冒险女儿蒂拉德-莱恩斯滕（Tierad Rynesten）率领，三周前出发，但此后就没有了消息。蒂拉德的父亲寻找冒险家来追踪商队并救出他的女儿。不幸的是，提拉德碰上了住在山里的野蛮人部落--一个秘密崇拜住在山顶的冰冻之神的部落。虽然许多牧民已经被牺牲或吃掉了，但仍有一些人被带到Llymic神父那里接受他的祝福。如果党派释放了蒂拉德，她会告诉他们野蛮人举行的奇怪仪式，以及他们有时会改变的方式，在永远离开部落之前呈现出非人的冰冷特征。这个情节可以设置在任何有一座大山和附近其他村庄的城市。理想的情况是，这支队伍过去曾为提拉德的父亲工作，使他们成为提拉德呼唤援助的合理选择。",
	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} An icy glacier begins to creep down the mountain where Tierad was once held prisoner. A small town nearby is dealing with harsh winter conditions (regardless of the actual season). Any friends the party might have in this village call for their help as strange ice creatures begin murdering the remaining livestock and villagers. Although the threat can be beaten back, the town must eventually be abandoned to the grinding ice. The only thing left behind is the image of an old man who wanders the streets and never draws close to anyone, but always beckons onlookers toward the mountain.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):}一个冰冷的冰川开始从提拉德曾经被关押的山上爬下来。附近的一个小镇正在应对严酷的冬季条件（无论实际季节如何）。当奇怪的冰雪生物开始谋杀剩余的牲畜和村民时，党在这个村子里的任何朋友都会向他们求救。虽然威胁可以被击退，但该镇最终必须被抛弃在磨碎的冰层中。唯一留下的是一个老人的形象，他在街道上徘徊，从不接近任何人，但总是向围观的人招手，让他们走向山。",
	"{@b SPL 13 (Moderate Sign):} As the ice from the mountain spreads and the days grow noticeably shorter, darkness begins to settle over the land. Rumors from all around the area report ice creatures prowling the night and constant disappearances. One small town has gone completely silent. Drawn to the place, the party finds it the home of horrible ice monsters, as if all the villagers have been transformed into mockeries of their former selves. The old man appears again, this time grinning with a maw of icy fangs, beckoning to the looming glacial peak in the distance.": "{@b SPL 13 (Moderate Sign):} 随着山中的冰块蔓延，白昼明显变短，黑暗开始笼罩大地。来自该地区各地的传言称，冰雪生物在夜间徘徊，并不断有人失踪。一个小镇已经完全沉寂了。队伍被吸引到这个地方，发现它是可怕的冰怪的家，好像所有的村民都变成了他们以前的模样。老人再次出现，这次他咧开冰冷的獠牙大嘴，向远处隐约可见的冰川山峰招手。",
	"{@b SPl 16 (Strong Sign):} The sun is barely visible in the sky, and snow and ice cover the land. Entire villages are empty, and terrible ice creatures roam the land. In one final desperate measure, the local lord entreats the party to solve this problem, giving them whatever resources he can muster. There is only one place to go: the mountain. While the characters climb its snowbound slopes, all manner of alien ice creatures try to slow their ascent, leading to a terrible conflict with the keepers of the summit: a tribe of converted frost giants (see Encounter 1).": "{@b SPl 16 (Strong Sign):} 天空中几乎看不到太阳，冰雪覆盖大地。整个村庄空无一人，可怕的冰雪生物在这片土地上游荡。在最后的绝望措施中，当地的领主恳求党派解决这个问题，给他们提供他能调动的任何资源。只有一个地方可以去：山。当角色们爬上雪山的时候，各种外来的冰雪生物试图减缓他们的上升速度，导致他们与山顶的守护者发生可怕的冲突：一个由冰霜巨人组成的部落（见遭遇1）。",
	"{@b SPL 19 (Overwhelming Sign):} As the party reaches the mountain's peak, the sun no longer rises and the temperature keeps dropping. There is no sunlight anymore, and those who don't have darkvision are practically blind. At the summit, the party encounters the most powerful representatives of Father Llymic's brood, including a transformed dragon. After braving these last challenges, Father Llymic's icy form finally stirs. His gigantic alien bulk shatters the last sheet of ice and surveys the perfect darkness he has created (see Encounters 2 and 3).": "{@b SPL 19 (Overwhelming Sign):} 当队伍到达山顶时，太阳不再升起，温度不断下降。没有阳光了，没有暗视的人几乎是瞎子。在山顶，队伍遇到了Llymic神父的最强大的代表，包括一条变身的龙。在经历了这些最后的挑战之后，Llymic神父的冰冷形态终于出现了。他巨大的外星体型击碎了最后一片冰层，并勘察了他所创造的完美的黑暗环境（见遭遇2和3）。",
	"Only after Father Llymic's defeat might the sun rise again and the world begin to thaw. What world is left, however, is for you to decide.": "只有在Llymic神父被打败后，太阳才可能重新升起，世界才会开始解冻。然而，剩下的是什么世界，要由你来决定。",
	"In Eberron, the Far Realm is known by another name: the Plane of Xoriat. When the plane was last coterminous, Xoriat bled all sorts of horrors into the world until the Gatekeeper druids altered its orbit and the taint began to wane. Father Llymic was one of the entities that managed to remain behind. The Gatekeepers entombed his body atop one of the highest summits of the Howling Peaks in present-day Zilargo.": "在Eberron，远界有另一个名字：Xoriat位面。当这个位面最后一次共存的时候，Xoriat将各种恐怖的东西注入这个世界，直到守门人德鲁伊改变了它的轨道，污点开始减弱。Llymic神父是设法留下来的实体之一。守门人将他的尸体埋葬在今天齐拉尔戈的嚎叫山峰的最高峰之一上。",
	"Father Llymic is a deadly threat to all Khorvaire. If he awakens, first Zilargo and Breland feel his icy touch, and then the entire world might be drawn into madness as Xoriat once again becomes coterminous.

	"The high elves are known for their skill in powerful elven High Magic. During the time of Myth Drannor, they opened a gate to the Far Realm and nearly brought disaster upon themselves. Although that threat was averted, Father Llymic's body became a symbol of their mistake. His body has remained entombed in the Thunder Peaks to this day, waiting for the darkness to grant his freedom.": "高等精灵以其强大的精灵高级魔法技能而闻名。在神话德兰诺时期，他们打开了通往远界的大门，差点给自己带来灾难。虽然这个威胁被避免了，但Llymic神父的尸体成为他们错误的象征。他的尸体至今仍被埋葬在雷峰中，等待着黑暗给予他自由。",
	"Travelers making use of the Thunder Gap might be the first to notice Father Llymic's menace, since that trail passes close to his glacial tomb. Once Father Llymic wakes, Cormyr, Sembia, and all the Dalelands would be the first to face his alien minions. A splinter group of Shar's worshipers called the Black Ice has taken up the idea of freeing Father Llymic for the glory of the dark goddess. These individuals have set up camp near his prison, and although some have already been transformed, they still search for ways to free him.": "利用雷霆峡谷的旅行者可能是第一个注意到Llymic神父的威胁的人，因为那条小路靠近他的冰川坟墓。一旦Llymic神父醒来，科米尔、森比亚和所有达利兰都将首先面对他的异形爪牙。一个名为 \"黑冰 \"的夏尔崇拜者的分裂团体已经开始为黑暗女神的荣耀而解放赖特米克神父的想法。这些人在他的监狱附近安营扎寨，虽然有些人已经被改造了，但他们仍然在寻找释放他的方法。",
	"Rather than have Father Llymic be imprisoned upon a block of ice, he may be banished to another plane or some other extradimensional prison for all eternity. As his Brood Spawn spread across the campaign setting, the binds that hold him in his prison weaken, culminating with his arrival in the setting.": "与其让Llymic神父被囚禁在一块冰上，不如让他被放逐到另一个位面或其他超维度的监狱，直到永远。随着他的 \"兄弟再生 \"在竞选环境中的扩散，将他关在监狱中的束缚也会减弱，最终他将来到这个环境中。",
	"Or perhaps Father Llymic isn't imprisoned at all. He might be in the Far Realm or one of the other planes of existence, or in the case of a Spelljammer campaign, he might be on another planet in a distant sphere. In the former case, perhaps Father Llymic has already claimed one of the Outer Planes as his own icy domain. In the latter case, he might reside in a frozen crystal sphere whose sun has permanently gone dark. Either way, such a campaign would pose Father Llymic as an evil outsider whose Brood Spawn have invaded the setting, and the arrival of Father Llymic himself would spell doom for mortal life altogether.": "也许Llymic神父根本就没有被囚禁。他可能在远界或其他存在的星球之一，或者在咒语战役的情况下，他可能在一个遥远的球体中的另一个星球。在前一种情况下，也许Llymic神父已经将外域之一作为他自己的冰雪领域。在后一种情况下，他可能居住在一个冰冻的水晶球中，而这个水晶球的太阳已经永久地变黑了。无论哪种情况，这样的活动都会使Llymic神父成为一个邪恶的外来者，他的Brood Spawn已经入侵了这个环境，而Llymic神父本人的到来会给凡人的生活带来厄运。",
	"Additionally, you may wish to alter Father Llymic's Sign of Apocalypse if you feel its default effects are not appropriate for your campaign. Instead of causing the sun to disappear, Father Llymic might simply cause the setting to experience an unnatural winter as his influence spreads. Temperatures fall as normal, but permafrost spreads from the mountain housing Father Llymic's tomb to envelop the entire world as the campaign goes on. In this case, you may wish to remove the Light Torpor and Light Weakness traits from Father Llymic and his Brood Spawn, instead relying on the very absence of heat to be that which awakens the Alien Thought Given Flesh.": "此外，如果你觉得Llymic神父的天启标志的默认效果不适合你的活动，你可能希望改变它。Llymic神父可能不会使太阳消失，而是随着他的影响的扩散，使环境经历一个非自然的冬天。气温正常下降，但永久冻土从Llymic神父的坟墓所在的山上蔓延开来，随着战役的进行笼罩了整个世界。在这种情况下，你可能希望从Llymic神父和他的肉身再生者身上去掉 \"轻度昏睡 \"和 \"轻度虚弱 \"的特性，而是依靠没有热量来唤醒 \"异形思想 \"的特性。",
	"Lastly, some may find the default campaign timeline to lack the intrigue and variety that they seek in an elder evils campaign. If so, consider the following changes and additions:": "最后，有些人可能会发现默认的活动时间线缺乏他们在长老会活动中所寻求的阴谋和多样性。如果是这样，请考虑以下的变化和补充。",
	"Associate Father Llymic with the other denizens of the Far Realm. While the brood spawn are certainly interesting creatures to fight, other aberrations such as mind flayers and daelkyr might serve Father Llymic's interests as well.": "将Llymic神父与远界的其他居民联系起来。雏鸟之卵固然是有趣的战斗对象，但其他反常者，如心魔和戴尔克尔，也可能符合Llymic神父的利益。",
	"Brood spawn do not suffer reductions to their Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores; in fact, their Wisdom and Charisma are each increased by 2 compared to that of the base creature. As such, rather than using them as mindless aliens, you are capable of running them as an intelligent faction that has its own unique NPCs, sub-groups, and society, although such elements are obviously warped by the brood's alien nature.": "Brood spawn不会降低他们的智力、智慧或魅力分数；事实上，他们的智慧和魅力比基本生物的分数各增加了2分。因此，与其把他们当作无意识的外星人来使用，不如把他们当作一个有自己独特的NPC、子群体和社会的智能派别来管理，尽管这些元素显然被兄弟的外星性质所扭曲。",
	"Run a more active or intelligent Cult of Father Llymic. While the original timeline speaks of savage barbarians that perform strange rituals that transform them into Brood Spawn, you may wish to alter this existing cult or add new ones as you see fit. Perhaps a humanoid-esque brood spawn has figured out how to blend into society and to spread Brood Fever without getting caught. Maybe a vampire or some other creature of the night seeks to black out the sun, knowingly or unknowingly allowing Father Llymic to emerge from his prison sooner than expected. Keep in mind that this document provides cult features for NPCs that serve Father Llymic, as well as general Vile Feats for such NPCs to take as appropriate; use these features to create NPCs that fit your campaign as you see fit.": "经营一个更活跃或更聪明的Llymic神父的崇拜。虽然原来的时间线说的是野蛮的野蛮人，他们举行奇怪的仪式，把他们变成Brood Spawn，但你可能希望改变这个现有的邪教，或添加你认为合适的新邪教。也许一个人形的肉体产卵者已经想出了如何融入社会并传播肉体热而不被发现。也许一个吸血鬼或其他夜间生物试图遮住太阳，有意或无意地让Llymic神父比预期的更早地从他的监狱里出来。请记住，本文件为服务于Llymic神父的NPC提供了邪教特征，并为这些NPC提供了适当的一般卑鄙功能；使用这些特征来创建适合你的活动的NPC，你认为合适。",
	"Retaining only a vague resemblance to the creatures that spawned them, the brood are terrible to behold. Made entirely of pale blue crystal, brood spawn are covered in sharp spikes and ridged plates. These protrusions grind against one another but never dull. When a brood spawn is wounded, a pale ichor flows out of the wounds, quickly hardening into a seal. Strange organs pulsate and strain inside them, and no two share the same physiology, even if they originated from the same type of creature. All have three perfectly round eyes atop their head, above a cavernous maw. These eyes allow them to see in any conditions of ilumination.": "虫卵与产生它们的生物只有模糊的相似之处，它们是可怕的。完全由淡蓝色的水晶制成，雏形的卵子覆盖着锋利的尖刺和脊板。这些突起物相互磨擦，但从不迟钝。当一个卵巢受伤时，一种苍白的汁液会从伤口处流出，很快就会硬化成一个封印。陌生的器官在它们体内跳动和紧张，没有两个人的生理结构是相同的，即使它们源自同一类型的生物。它们的头顶上都有三只完美的圆眼，在一个空洞的大嘴之上。这些眼睛使它们能够在任何光照条件下看到东西。",
	"You might be wondering, if this template (or one of the other templates in this book) is applied to a creature, what is its new Challenge Rating? A problem I faced when making the templates found here is that such a calculation must be done for each individual creature a template is applied to, especially with templates like this that depend on creature size.

Those who know of the Hulks have only read of them in dusty ancient scrolls, and the barely comprehensible tidings contained therein are usually discounted as superstitious nonsense, mad ramblings, or at best archaic and obsolete information.": "很少有学者听说过Zoretha的Hulks。没有多少人见过绿巨人，更少有人能活到现在，把五个石碑隐藏在北方白雪皑皑的山林深处的故事流传下来。那些知道绿巨人的人只在尘封的古代卷轴中读到过它们，其中包含的勉强可以理解的消息通常被认为是迷信的废话、疯狂的胡言乱语，或者充其量是陈旧过时的信息。",
	"Only the most perceptive aficionados of the ancient and the bizarre notice the strange similarities in the archaic accounts of visits to the Hulks. These accounts reveal that the Hulks have existed far longer than the reach of recorded memory, even that of the elves. They are too old to have been carved by any civilization known to mortal scholarship, and no mythology hints at their creation being attributed to any god.": "只有最敏锐的古代和怪异的爱好者才会注意到访问绿巨人的古代记载中的奇怪的相似之处。这些记载显示，绿巨人存在的时间远远超过了有记载的记忆范围，甚至是精灵的记忆。它们太古老了，不可能是凡人学术界所知的任何文明所雕刻的，也没有任何神话暗示它们是由任何神创造的。",
	"The scholars most knowledgeable about the Hulks of Zoretha recognize that the horror of the Hulks is no mere superstitious nonsense. Far from being simple carvings from some primeval civilization, the Hulks of Zoretha radiate some kind of nightmare-inducing power. They are horrifying to all who look upon them, sometimes to the point of driving even servants of the gods mad. Those thus afflicted are sometimes able to reveal more information about the Hulks of Zoretha through their nightmares than history alone could ever disclose.": "对Zoretha绿巨人最有研究的学者认识到，绿巨人的恐怖并不仅仅是迷信的胡说八道。Zoretha的绿巨人远不是来自某个原始文明的简单雕刻，它们散发着某种诱发噩梦的力量。它们让所有看到它们的人感到恐惧，有时甚至会使神的仆人发疯。那些被折磨的人有时能够通过他们的噩梦揭示出更多关于Zoretha绿巨人的信息，而这些信息是历史所无法透露的。",
	"A small number of living mortals in the world have seen the Hulks in person or hold copies of recent accounts of such visits. These people are either too mad to publish their experiences or too fearful for the world if the existence of the Hulks becomes common knowledge. Visitors to the Hulks of Zoretha attest to the presence of mad cults worshiping the Hulks as gods. These cults believe that the monoliths fell from the sky before the dawn of mortals and that they will one day awaken and purify the world of all sickness and filth.": "世界上有少数活着的凡人曾亲眼见过绿巨人，或持有这种访问的最新记录的副本。这些人要么是太疯狂而不敢公布他们的经历，要么是太害怕绿巨人的存在成为众所周知的事情。访问Zoretha绿巨人的人证明了存在着将绿巨人当作神来崇拜的疯狂邪教。这些邪教相信，这些巨石在凡人的黎明之前就从天上掉下来了，有一天它们会苏醒过来，净化世界上所有的疾病和污秽。",
	"The cults that worship the Hulks compete over the possession of the {@item Zoretha Scrolls|EdE}, originally penned millennia ago by a dwarf priest and war-scribe known to history only as I Weep. Though I Weep's insane ramblings are difficult to decipher, they indicate that through evaluation of the nightmares of hundreds of different beings, he was able to discern the Hulks' true purpose in this world: The Hulks are forerunners of alien colonization from a place called Zoretha. If awakened, the Hulks will begin with the systematic eradication of all life on the planet to make room for their own horrible alien offspring, which they will give birth to when the time is right.": "崇拜绿巨人的邪教为了争夺《%0%》的所有权而竞争，这本书最初是由一个矮人牧师和战神写的，在历史上只被称为I Weep。尽管 \"我哭泣 \"的疯狂呓语难以破译，但它表明，通过对数百个不同生命的噩梦的评估，他能够看出绿巨人在这个世界上的真正目的。绿巨人是来自一个叫Zoretha的地方的外星人殖民的先驱。如果被唤醒，绿巨人将开始有计划地消灭这个星球上的所有生命，为他们自己的可怕的外星后代腾出空间，当时机成熟时，他们将生下这些后代。",
	"The Hulks need some kind of energy infusion to awaken. For some reason, whatever alien race sent this colonization unit to the world never saw fit to awaken its representatives. The Hulks stand conscious but immobile until they can either make contact with their home realm, wherever that might be, or inspire mortals to create the circumstances necessary to bring them to life again.": "绿巨人需要某种能量灌注才能觉醒。出于某种原因，无论哪个外星种族将这支殖民部队送到这个世界上，都没有看到适合唤醒其代表。绿巨人有意识地站在那里，但却无法动弹，直到他们能够与他们的家乡联系，无论那里是什么地方，或者激励凡人创造必要的环境，使他们重新获得生命。",
	"Once awake, the Hulks will seek to purify the world. Even among scholars and certainly among cultists of the Hulks, the meaning of this purification is hotly debated. The purification is necessary to make way for the Children of Zoretha, the nature of which is also debated.": "一旦觉醒，绿巨人将寻求净化世界。即使在学者中，当然在绿巨人的崇拜者中，对这种净化的意义也有激烈的辩论。净化是为Zoretha之子让路所必需的，其性质也有争论。",
	"In truth, the purification intended by the Hulks of Zoretha is nothing less than the eradication of sapient life in the world. If awakened, they intend to destroy all beings that might conceivably one day compete for land or resources with the Children of Zoretha.": "事实上，Zoretha的Hulks打算进行的净化，不亚于消灭世界上的有智慧的生命。如果被唤醒，他们打算摧毁所有可能在某一天与Zoretha之子争夺土地或资源的生物。",
	"Consisting of four females and one male, the five Hulks of Zoretha will begin to breed and spawn when their purification work is done, filling the world with their own foul descendants.": "由四名女性和一名男性组成，Zoretha的五名绿巨人将在他们的净化工作完成后开始繁殖和产卵，用他们自己的肮脏的后代充满这个世界。",
	"The cults that worship the Hulks of Zoretha have been working for years to raise their strange stone gods to life. Since the Five are preparing to finally awaken, it seems as if they are about to succeed.": "崇拜Zoretha绿巨人的邪教组织多年来一直在努力使他们奇怪的石神复活。由于五人组正准备最终觉醒，他们似乎就要成功了。",

	"{@b Excluding Player Characters:} To preserve party integrity, a DM may wish to exclude the player characters from the direct mechanical detriments of this sign (as per the Strong and Overwhelming effects). Rather, a DM may wish to describe how the temper of each character shortens and how their anger becomes more volatile as the sign intensifies; this method requires cooperation from the players so that they can properly roleplay these effects over the course of the campaign. This may also be done with NPCs that are powerful enough to resist entering a rage or frenzy on a regular basis.": "{@b Excluding Player Characters:}为了保持聚会的完整性，DM可能希望将玩家角色排除在这个征兆的直接机械损害之外（就像强烈和压倒性的效果一样）。相反，DM可能希望描述每个角色的脾气是如何缩短的，以及他们的愤怒是如何随着征兆的加强而变得更加不稳定的；这种方法需要玩家的配合，以便他们能够在活动过程中正确地扮演这些效果。这也可以用那些强大到足以抵制经常进入愤怒或狂热状态的NPC来做。",

	"{@b Strong:} As moderate, but living creatures also risk flying into an uncontrollable rage. Each day when it awakens (or at the beginning of the day if it does not require sleep), a creature must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, a creature attacks the nearest creature it can see.

	"{@b Overwhelming:} As strong, but the DC of the Wisdom saving throw increases to 16.

The property in question is a copy of the {@item Zoretha Scrolls|EdE}, and Nilaenish is concerned about the manuscript falling into the \"wrong hands\". Everything seems completely legitimate, and Nilaenish's rival is violently insane. The party retrieves the item as requested and return it to the scholar's safekeeping. She promises to lock the book away safely where no one will ever read it again.": "{@b SPL 5:}索尔玛-尼拉尼什(Soelma Nilaenish)雇用该党派谨慎地取回被一个敌对学者偷走的财产。所涉财产是一份{@item Zoretha Scrolls|EdE}的副本，尼拉尼什担心手稿落入 \"坏人手中\"。一切似乎都是完全合法的，而尼拉尼什的对手是个暴力疯子。当事人按照要求取回了物品，并将其交还给学者保管。她承诺将书安全地锁起来，没有人会再读它。",
	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} Tempers are on the rise everywhere when the party's old employer, Soelma Nilaenish, contacts them again. She expects trouble at the building where she meets with her scholarly society. She fears that someone wishes to break into the society's artifact collection, which contains a copy of the Zoretha Scrolls. The party arrives to find a riot outside the building and must help authorities to calm or disperse the mob. Nilaenish pays them handsomely and seems not to fully understand how or why the riot started. There is no further trouble, but the society increases magical security on its collection of artifacts.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):}当党的老雇主苏尔玛-尼拉尼什(Soelma Nilaenish)再次联系他们时，各地的脾气都在上升。她预计在她与她的学术团体会面的大楼里会有麻烦。她担心有人想闯入该协会的文物收藏，其中有一份Zoretha卷轴的副本。他们到达时发现大楼外发生了暴乱，必须帮助当局平息或驱散暴徒。尼拉尼什给了他们丰厚的报酬，而且似乎并不完全了解骚乱是如何或为什么开始的。没有进一步的麻烦，但该协会对其收藏的文物加强了魔法安全。",

	"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} Distressed by a recent discovery, Soelma Nilaenish contacts the party to act as her bodyguards on a long journey to the far north. There, she explains, an evil giant is attempting to awaken an ancient evil that she associates with the recent violent behavior of the common people. Near the end of the journey, the party encounters Janwulf the Soulbiter and his followers. Janwulf is familiar with Nilaenish and acts as if she has betrayed him somehow. After his defeat at the party's hands, Nilaenish leads the party into a death trap, reveals herself to be a powerful and evil wizard, and leaves with Janwulf's followers in her service. She also leaves full payment for the party's services as a joke.": "{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):}索尔玛-尼拉尼什(Soelma Nilaenish)对最近的一个发现感到不安，她联系了党，让党在前往遥远的北方的漫长旅程中充当她的保镖。她解释说，在那里，一个邪恶的巨人正试图唤醒一个古老的恶魔，她认为这与最近普通人的暴力行为有关。在旅程接近尾声的时候，队伍遇到了噬魂者扬武夫和他的追随者。扬武夫对尼拉尼什很熟悉，并且表现得好像她以某种方式背叛了他。在他败在队伍手中之后，妮拉妮丝将队伍带入了一个死亡陷阱，并表明自己是一个强大而邪恶的巫师，然后带着扬武夫的追随者们离开。她还留下了对党的服务的全部付款，作为一个玩笑。",
	"{@b SPL 18 (Strong Sign):} After learning where Nilaenish has gone, the party arrives just in time to interrupt her ritual. Assuming they defeat her, they recover her copy of the Zoretha Scrolls. Since the Hulks are still quiescent, the party seem to be victorious. A blank page is torn out of the end of Nilaenish's book, however, and one of Janwulf's more memorable cultists was not present at Nilaenish's final battle (see Encounters 1 and 2).": "{@b SPL 18 (Strong Sign):} 在得知尼拉尼什的去向后，队伍及时赶到，打断了她的仪式。假设他们打败了她，他们就能找到她的Zoretha卷轴副本。由于绿巨人仍然处于静止状态，他们似乎取得了胜利。然而，尼拉尼什的书的结尾被撕掉了一页空白，而杨武夫的一个更令人难忘的崇拜者并没有出现在尼拉尼什的最后战斗中（见遭遇1和2）。",
	"By this point in the campaign, most major nations are at war with one another. Fighting is constant everywhere the party goes.": "到了战役的这一阶段，大多数主要国家都在相互交战。党所到之处，战斗不断。",
	"{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):} Whether or not the party attempts to track down the missing page and cultist, they arrive back at the Hulks too late to stop the second ritual. The cultist used the original, crumbling Zoretha Scrolls and ritual instructions scrawled on a scrap of parchment from the back of Nilaenish's copy. The Hulks awaken, and the party must fight all five to save the world (see Encounter 3).": "{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):}无论党派是否试图追踪失踪的那页纸和邪教徒，他们回到绿巨人的时候已经晚了，无法阻止第二个仪式的进行。邪教徒使用了原始的、摇摇欲坠的Zoretha卷轴，以及从Nilaenish的副本背面的一张羊皮纸上涂抹的仪式说明。绿巨人苏醒了，派对必须与所有五个绿巨人战斗以拯救世界（见遭遇3）。",
	"In Eberron, the Hulks of Zoretha are located somewhere on the unnamed landmass north of the Bitter Sea. With the aftermath of the Last War so recent, the violent effect of the Hulks' blood moon might dredge up old conflicts more quickly than might happen in another setting.": "在Eberron中，Zoretha的绿巨人位于苦海以北的某个未命名的地块上。由于最后一次战争的后果是如此之近，绿巨人的血月的剧烈影响可能会比在其他环境中发生的更快地挖出旧的冲突。",
	"In addition, the prevalence of practical magic in Eberron allows more useful advances than most settings enjoy. The crudeness and squalor of the Temple of Zoretha is therefore all the starker to adventurers in Eberron. Not since the Last War has the party seen living conditions so base and impoverished.": "此外，Eberron中实用魔法的盛行允许比大多数设定享有更多有用的进步。因此，Zoretha神庙的简陋和肮脏对Eberron的冒险者来说更加明显。自上次战争以来，冒险者们从未见过如此简陋和贫穷的生活条件。",
	"The Great Glacier is the perfect place for the Hulks of Zoretha to have lain hidden for thousands of years, and the dangerous normal inhabitants of the area explain the natural toughness of the cultists defending it. Carcasses of slain local creatures, perhaps even that of a young white dragon, might be an interesting addition to the cultists' food storage area.": "大冰川是Zoretha的绿巨人隐藏了数千年的完美场所，而该地区危险的正常居民解释了保卫它的邪教徒们的自然坚韧。被杀的当地生物的尸体，也许甚至是年轻的白龙的尸体，可能会成为邪教徒们食物储存区的有趣补充。",
	"Soelma Nilaenish should be considered a moon elf unless some other race would help her fit into the campaign.": "Soelma Nilaenish应该被认为是月精灵，除非其他种族能帮助她融入竞选。",
	"As mentioned, the Hulks of Zoretha are underwhelming because they are required to individually be weak in order to be a group encounter for high level players. Thus, DMs that feel the Hulks are boring as a group may run them as one colossal Elder Evil that I dubbed the \"Titan of Zoretha\".": "如前所述，Zoretha的绿巨人是令人难以接受的，因为它们被要求个别地很弱，以便成为高等级玩家的团体遭遇。因此，觉得绿巨人作为一个团体很无聊的管理员可以将它们作为一个巨大的上古恶魔来使用，我称之为 \"Zoretha的泰坦\"。",
	"A five-headed monolith big enough to tackle a tarrasque, the Titan of Zoretha can be used as a replacement of the five Hulks in a standard campaign. However, if a DM makes the Hulks and Children of Zoretha non-unique (i.e. a reoccuring monster type throughout the campaign), the Titan of Zoretha would instead be used as their leader. This way, the aliens of Zoretha can be used as an entire faction of enemies, rather than relying on cultists and the Hulks' Blood Moon sign to create conflict throughout the campaign.": "Zoretha泰坦是一块足以对付塔拉斯克的五头巨石，在标准战役中可以用来替代五个绿巨人。然而，如果管理员将绿巨人和索雷塔之子作为非独特的怪物（即在整个战役中重复出现的怪物类型），那么索雷塔泰坦将被用作他们的领袖。这样一来，Zoretha的外星人就可以作为一个完整的敌人派别，而不是依靠邪教徒和绿巨人的血月标志在整个活动中制造冲突。",
	"Thus, I included statistics for the Children of Zoretha (both {@creature child of zoretha (female)|EdE|Females} and {@creature child of zoretha (male)|EdE|Males}) and the variant {@creature Titan of Zoretha|EdE} in this conversion. They are simply my imagining of these concepts, which I do not claim to have a definitive monopoly over or understanding of.": "因此，我在这次转换中包括了Zoretha之子（包括（%0%）和（%1%））和变体（%2%）的统计。它们只是我对这些概念的想象，我并不声称对这些概念有明确的垄断或理解。",
	"In addition to the above content, consider the following changes and additions:": "除上述内容外，请考虑以下变化和补充。",
	"Associate the Hulks with the Far Realm. The Hulks are easily associated with the Far Realm due to their madness-inducing traits. Perhaps Zoretha is a layer of the Far Realm, and the Hulks' Innate Spellcasting traits are actually psionic in nature. Throughout the campaign, more and more aberrations might threaten the world in preparation for the Hulks' awakening.": "将绿巨人与远界联系起来。由于绿巨人的疯狂特性，他们很容易与远界联系起来。也许Zoretha是远界的一个层级，而绿巨人的先天法术特性实际上是幻觉的性质。在整个活动中，越来越多的反常现象可能会威胁到这个世界，为绿巨人的觉醒做准备。",
	"Elaborate upon the mysterious place called Zoretha. In a Spelljammer campaign, perhaps Zoretha is a distant crystal sphere that the other denizens of Zoretha call home. In a planar campaign, perhaps Zoretha is a new plane of existence from outside the Great Wheel, or it is a small crevasse between two planes that has been undetected by mortal civilization.": "详述名为Zoretha的神秘地方。在Spelljammer战役中，也许Zoretha是一个遥远的水晶球，Zoretha的其他居民称之为家。在星球战役中，也许Zoretha是来自大轮回之外的一个新的存在平面，或者它是两个平面之间的一个小裂缝，一直没有被人类文明发现。",
	"Change the motivation of the Hulks as you see fit. As alien colonizers, the Hulks might seek to enslave the mortal races instead, using what is left of civlization when they awaken to construct a new society for their Children to live in. Or perhaps the Hulks seek to open a portal to Zoretha, allowing the rest of their kind to flood into their new colony. You can also change the motivations of the Cult of Zoretha. Perhaps they can perform sacrificial rituals in order to create or summon the Children of Zoretha, or maybe their desire to spread madness to all has allowed them to create the Blood Moon sign themselves.": "按你认为合适的方式改变绿巨人的动机。作为外星殖民者，绿巨人可能会寻求奴役凡人种族，在他们觉醒时利用文明的剩余部分来为他们的孩子们构建一个新的社会。或者，绿巨人会寻求打开一个通往Zoretha的入口，让他们的同类涌入他们的新殖民地。你也可以改变Zoretha教派的动机。也许他们可以为了创造或召唤Zoretha的孩子而进行献祭仪式，也许他们向所有人传播疯狂的欲望让他们自己创造了血月标志。",

	"The rock and ice of this \"temple\" have been hollowed out by hand to form a vast cavern with a permanent roof of ice hundreds of feet thick and a warren of tunnels and chambers leading off it. Cultists make their homes, such as they are, in these smaller chambers. Fire pits with crude chimneys cut into the rock allow cultists to keep themselves warm despite the year-round freezing temperatures. A nearby coal deposit provides fuel in the treeless wasteland they inhabit.": "这座 \"神庙 \"的岩石和冰被人工挖空，形成了一个巨大的洞穴，其永久的冰顶厚达数百英尺，并有大量的隧道和密室通向它。崇拜者们在这些较小的房间里安家，就像他们自己一样。尽管全年都是冰天雪地，但在岩石上开凿的带有粗糙烟囱的火坑使崇拜者能够保持自己的温暖。在他们居住的无树荒地上，附近的煤炭矿藏提供了燃料。",
	"All life in the temple centers around the great cavern where the uncaring monoliths have stood since far past the reach of mortal memory. Vast, echoing, and largely empty, the cavern nevertheless swarms with indistinct whispers and eerie shadows. During the day, sunlight filters thinly through the frozen roof, casting strange ripples and prisms of dim light. At night, torchlight glimmers against the ice ceiling, and the weird markings on the Hulks' bodies produce a shimmering effect.": "寺庙里所有的生命都围绕着巨大的洞穴，在那里，无情的巨石已经远远超过了凡人的记忆范围。巨大的、有回音的、基本上是空的，但洞穴里却涌动着模糊不清的低语和阴森恐怖的阴影。白天，阳光稀疏地穿过冰冻的屋顶，投下奇怪的涟漪和棱镜的昏暗光线。到了晚上，手电筒的光线在冰顶上闪烁，绿巨人身上的怪异标记产生了闪闪发光的效果。",
	"Mad cultists with little knowledge of architecture designed the temple of Zoretha. It was intended to be a cathedral and resting place grand enough for gods. What is most remarkable is how well the cultists succeeded at their goal, for the main cavern of the temple is nothing if not awesome.": "缺乏建筑知识的疯狂崇拜者设计了Zoretha神庙。它的目的是要成为一个大教堂和休息的地方，足以让神灵感到盛大。最令人瞩目的是，这些邪教分子在实现他们的目标方面取得了很大的成功，因为神庙的主洞如果不是令人敬畏的话，那就是一无是处。",
	"At its highest point, right above the Hulks, the ceiling of the cavern is 150 feet in height, and a roughly 90-foot-radius circle of it is ice. Large fires are never burned in the great cavern, so it is always very cold there.": "在最高点，就在绿巨人的上方，洞穴的天花板有150英尺高，其中大约90英尺半径的圈子是冰。大洞里从不烧大火，所以那里总是很冷。",
	"The ice ceiling allows for illumination throughout the chamber during daylight hours, though the light is blue and the room is lit no better than it would be with candles and torches. The cultists leave the place dark at night, except when they perform rituals. During rituals they use torches and fire pits similar to those in the cultists' sleeping quarters. Any light causes strange shimmers and tricks of the eye.": "冰天花板允许在白天对整个密室进行照明，尽管光线是蓝色的，房间里的光线并不比用蜡烛和火把更好。除了举行仪式时，邪教徒们在晚上会让这里一片漆黑。在仪式期间，他们使用火把和火盆，类似于邪教人员的睡房里的火盆。任何光线都会引起奇怪的闪耀和眼睛的欺骗。",
	"Other ceilings in the temple complex are stone, and most are 20 feet tall or lower. Some are as small as 5 feet tall. The exception to this is the main entry hall, which at 40 feet in height is designed to be a comfortable space for the 20-foot-tall monoliths once they awaken. All light outside the main cavern comes from fire pits left burning for warmth.": "寺庙建筑群中的其他天花板是石制的，大多数都是20英尺高或更低。有些则只有5英尺高。这方面的例外是主入口大厅，其高度为40英尺，旨在为20英尺高的巨石在苏醒后提供舒适的空间。主洞外的所有光线都来自为取暖而留下的火坑。",
	"The Temple of Zoretha is well defended by the cultists who live there. Even when the majority are out raiding or hunting, a substantial guard is left behind to defend their gods' resting place. Surviving the harsh climate and the cult's internal squabbles make cultists tougher and better fighters than average folk. Defenders of less than CR 3 are rare.": "Zoretha神庙被住在那里的邪教徒们很好地保卫着。即使大多数人都出去抢劫或打猎了，也会留下大量的卫兵来保卫他们的神的安息地。在恶劣的气候和邪教的内部争吵中生存，使邪教成员比普通人更坚强，更有战斗力。CR值低于3的保卫者很少。",
	"After the main gate, the next line of defense is the great hall itself. Intruders are ambushed upon entry if possible. Cultists know that their monoliths are invulnerable, and those retaining the slightest shred of sanity do not defend the main cavern to the death.": "大门之后，下一道防线是大殿本身。如果可能的话，入侵者会在进入时遭到伏击。崇拜者知道他们的巨石是无懈可击的，而那些保留着一丝理智的人也不会死守主洞。",
	"The twists and turns of the smaller chambers and tunnels provide useful ambush spots or defensible last stands. If faced with particularly powerful intruders, the strongest Medium and Small warriors have instructions to defend the library, which can be accessed only by Medium or smaller creatures. Defenders of the library fight to their last breath.": "小房间和隧道的曲折变化提供了有用的伏击点或可防御的最后阵地。如果面对特别强大的入侵者，最强壮的中型和小型战士有指示要保卫图书馆，只有中型或小型生物才能进入图书馆。图书馆的保卫者们会战斗到最后一息。",
	"Once the Hulks' Blood Moon sign reaches the strong or overwhelming stage, cultists of Zoretha can voluntarily enter a frenzy as noted in the sign's description.": "一旦绿巨人的血月征兆达到强烈或压倒性的阶段，Zoretha的崇拜者可以自愿进入狂热状态，正如征兆的描述中所指出的。",

	"Set into an icy cliff face, this enormous tunnel is obscured by huge, fanglike icicles and large piles of packed snow; it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) to notice the entrance before entering bowshot range. The entrance tunnel is guarded by ten to twelve cultists who gain cover from the ice and snow in the opening. Guards attack anyone they do not know as soon as they are in range. There is no password, and they cannot be reasoned with or bribed. Encounter 1 provides an example of entrance guards who are prepared for powerful opponents.": "这条巨大的隧道位于冰冷的崖壁上，被巨大的、像獠牙一样的冰柱和大堆的积雪所掩盖；在进入弓箭射程之前，需要成功地使用DC15智慧（{@skill Perception}）来注意到这个入口。入口通道由10到12个邪教徒守卫，他们在入口处的冰雪中获得掩护。守卫一旦进入范围就会攻击他们不认识的人。没有密码，也不能对他们进行说理或贿赂。遭遇1提供了一个入口守卫的例子，他们对强大的对手有所准备。",
	"Any cultists in the cavern attack intruders on sight. In combat, keep in mind the huge scale of the room. Most Medium cultists worshiping among the monoliths, for example, need at least 2 rounds to reach melee fighting range of the entrance. All ranged fighters should have little trouble finding cover among the support pillars along the edge of the hall or behind the monoliths themselves. If a leader is present, cultists attempt to surround and trap intruders in the central area, so that they can be picked off by archers. Encounter 2 portrays the final fight with Soelma Nilaenish and the cultists in this area.": "洞穴中的任何邪教徒都会当场攻击入侵者。在战斗中，请记住这个房间的巨大规模。例如，大多数在巨石间膜拜的中型邪教徒需要至少2个回合才能到达入口处的近战范围。所有的远程战士在大厅边缘的支撑柱中或石碑后面找到掩护应该没有什么问题。如果有首领在场，邪教分子会试图将入侵者包围并困在中央区域，这样他们就可以被弓箭手挑走。遭遇2描绘了与索尔玛-尼拉尼什和邪教徒在这个区域的最后战斗。",
	"This alcove just inside the main entrance makes a perfect ambush spot to surprise those coming up the entrance tunnel. Stone formations and a well-placed support pillar grant anyone crouching here advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks in all but full daylight.

	"Spawned by the raw and undiluted chaos of creation, the world-spanning creature called the Leviathan slumbers deep beneath the waves, its dreams and stirrings producing monsters and disaster in the world above. Few on the surface are aware of the terrible threat that the Leviathan represents, but in the depths of the ocean, a creature of unspeakable evil seeks to use the mighty creature for his own nefarious purposes.": "由原始的、未被稀释的创世混沌孕育而生的，被称为 \"利维坦 \"的横跨世界的生物沉睡在海浪之下，它的梦想和搅动在上面的世界产生了怪物和灾难。在海面上，很少有人意识到利维坦所代表的可怕威胁，但在海洋深处，一个无法形容的邪恶生物试图利用这个强大的生物来达到自己邪恶的目的。",
	"Most legends depict the creation of the universe as an ordered, methodical process carried out by the gods. Only a few myths describe the difficulties and obstacles that the gods encountered. A handful of legends told by the oldest elementals and dragons spin a different tale, however. These stories are all but forgotten today.": "大多数传说将宇宙的创造描绘成一个由众神进行的有序的、有条不紊的过程。只有少数神话描述了诸神遇到的困难和障碍。然而，由最古老的元素和龙讲述的少数传说则是一个不同的故事。这些故事在今天几乎都被遗忘了。",
	"When the gods created the worlds and the various planes of existence, they did so by manipulating law and chaos, adding one to the other, subtracting, combining, subdividing. Each world is a precise mixture of the two, with order providing stability and chaos producing change. Inevitably, one force or the other falls out of balance and must in some fashion be restricted or controlled. The beast called the Leviathan is nothing less than the raw chaos resulting from the creation of the world, given flesh and form.": "当众神创造世界和各种存在的平面时，他们是通过操纵法律和混沌，把一个加到另一个，减去，结合，细分。每个世界都是两者的精确混合，秩序提供稳定，混乱产生变化。不可避免地，一种力量或另一种力量失去了平衡，必须以某种方式加以限制或控制。被称为 \"利维坦 \"的野兽就是世界创造后产生的原始混乱，被赋予了肉体和形式。",
	"Balance must be maintained in the universe, with law weighed against chaos. When worlds are created, however, these forces become unbalanced—generating \"leftovers\" from the process of creation, nearly always an excess of chaos. A chaotic imbalance can result in the creation of creatures that are almost pure chaos, existing only to bring about change and move their surroundings toward disorder. The Leviathan is one such entity.": "宇宙中必须保持平衡，用法律来权衡混乱。然而，当世界被创造时，这些力量变得不平衡--在创造过程中产生 \"遗留物\"，几乎总是过量的混沌。混乱的不平衡会导致创造出几乎是纯粹的混沌的生物，它们的存在只是为了带来变化，使其周围环境走向无序。利维坦就是这样一个实体。",
	"These chaos-entities can be forced into prison demiplanes or eternal slumber where they stir restlessly and dream, eventually disappearing as their energies slowly drain away. When awakened, however, an elder chaos-thing such as the Leviathan is driven to reduce all it encounters to ruin and nothingness.": "这些混沌实体可以被迫进入监狱的半位面或永恒的沉睡，在那里它们不安地搅拌和做梦，最终随着它们能量的慢慢流失而消失。然而，当被唤醒时，像 \"利维坦 \"这样的年长的混沌实体会被驱使将它所遇到的一切变成废墟和虚无。",
	"The Leviathan slumbers in the depths of the oceans. It is huge enough to encircle the entire world. Its chaos energy seeps out as it sleeps, and its dreams create monsters of the land and aberrant sea life. Its restless motions manifest in the form of hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanoes. Eventually the Leviathan's essential chaotic energy will all bleed away and it will fade into nothingness, but this might take longer than the life span of the world.": "利维坦沉睡在海洋深处。它的巨大足以包围整个世界。它的混沌能量在睡眠中渗出，它的梦创造了陆地上的怪物和反常的海洋生物。它不安的运动以飓风、海啸、地震和火山的形式表现出来。最终，\"利维坦 \"的基本混沌能量将全部流逝，它将淡化为虚无，但这可能要比世界的寿命更长。",
	"The Leviathan's awakening is foretold in ancient dragon legends—warning that if the great beast is roused to even semi awareness, the world will be shattered and remade. If brought fully awake, the Leviathan will destroy the world, and in doing so destroy itself. Such is the nature of the Leviathan, among the eldest of the beasts of chaos.": "利维坦的觉醒在古代龙的传说中早有预言--警告说，如果这只巨兽被唤醒，哪怕是半觉醒，世界也会被打碎并重塑。如果被完全唤醒，\"利维坦 \"将毁灭世界，并在此过程中毁灭自己。这就是 \"利维坦 \"的本质，它是混沌中最古老的巨兽。",
	"The Leviathan's only real goal—if it can even be said to have one—is to act in accordance with its nature. Given its creation and composition, the Leviathan's nature is simply chaos in its most destructive form. As it approaches wakefulness, the Leviathan's unconscious movements grow more frequent and violent, creating devastating catastrophes and producing deadly creatures. When it wakes the oceans boil and rage, whole continents slide into the abyssal deeps, and the entire world shudders. Once the Leviathan fully awakens, nothing short of concerted divine intervention can save the world from utter destruction.": "利维坦唯一真正的目标--如果它甚至可以说有的话--是按照它的本性行事。考虑到它的创造和组成，\"利维坦 \"的本质就是最具有破坏性的混乱。当它接近清醒时，\"利维坦 \"的无意识运动变得更加频繁和猛烈，创造了毁灭性的灾难，产生了致命的生物。当它醒来的时候，海洋沸腾了，愤怒了，整个大陆滑入深渊，整个世界都在颤抖。一旦 \"利维坦 \"完全苏醒，没有什么能比神明的一致干预更能使世界免于彻底的毁灭。",
	"The Leviathan is essentially mindless, and the destruction that it wreaks is simply the consequence of its fully wakened state. Legends told by the elder wyrms suggest that the Leviathan has approached consciousness on several occasions in the distant past, and this resulted in the various disasters that remade and changed the world. The fact that the world remains intact is proof that the creature returned to its slumbers.": "利维坦本质上是无意识的，它所造成的破坏只是其完全觉醒状态的结果。老巫师们讲述的传说表明，在遥远的过去，利维坦曾多次接近意识，这导致了各种灾难，重塑和改变了世界。世界仍然完好无损的事实证明，这个生物回到了它的沉睡状态。",
	"Depraved individuals might be willing to take the risk of utter destruction to use the sleeping Leviathan as a tool to achieve their wicked ends—the destruction of an enemy kingdom, the ruin of a continent for resources, or the reshaping of the entire world.": "堕落的人可能愿意冒着彻底毁灭的风险，利用沉睡的利维坦作为工具来达到他们邪恶的目的--毁灭一个敌国，毁掉一个大陆的资源，或者重塑整个世界。",
	"Everyone has heard legends about the Leviathan, ranging from wild sailors' tales of giant fish or whales to scholars' suggestions that the Leviathan is a real creature that has yet to be discovered. Few tales hint at the Leviathan's true power, and most of these are buried in the obscure dragon legends. Most scholars consider the Leviathan to be little more than an entertaining myth.": "每个人都听说过关于 \"利维坦 \"的传说，从野生水手的巨鱼或鲸鱼的故事到学者们认为 \"利维坦 \"是一种尚未被发现的真实生物。很少有故事暗示 \"利维坦 \"的真正力量，这些故事大多被埋没在晦涩的龙的传说中。大多数学者认为利维坦只不过是一个有趣的神话。",

	"The characters follow a suspected cult member to a ritual that is taking place on a windswept rocky isle a mile or so off the coast, where they see High Priest Enshaddon (actually Axihuatl the ixitxachitl priest in human guise) leading the worship of the Leviathan by summoning aberrations and sea monsters to ravage the city. The party must stop the cultists and any creatures they have summoned, but Enshaddon escapes in the confusion, diving back into the sea to keep his real identity secret.": "角色们跟随一名可疑的邪教成员来到离海岸一英里左右的风蚀石岛，在那里他们看到大祭司恩沙顿（实际上是化身为人类的艾西华特尔祭司）通过召唤异形和海怪蹂躏城市来领导对利维坦的崇拜。队伍必须阻止邪教分子和他们所召唤的任何生物，但恩沙顿在混乱中逃脱了，他潜回了海中，以保持他的真实身份的秘密。",

	"{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} Captured cultists tell of a final ritual in which High Priest Enshaddon intends to awaken the Leviathan.

The adventurers must make their way into the sea once more and confront the cultists.": "{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} 被俘虏的邪教徒讲述了一个最后的仪式，大祭司恩沙顿打算在这个仪式中唤醒利维坦。仪式将在从利维坦背上升起的巨大空心刺中的一座神庙中进行。冒险家们必须再次进入海中，与邪教组织对抗。",
	"Once at the place of the ritual, the characters attempt to stop Enshaddon, but their intervention causes the ritual to go terribly wrong—the Leviathan stirs, and the temple begins to flood. As the cultists drown, the party sees Enshaddon change to his true form, an enormous ixitxachitl. The party is swept away from the raging Axihuatl when a wall of the temple collapses and a massive tidal wave created by the Leviathan's awakening separates them (Encounter 1).": "一旦到了祭祀的地方，角色们试图阻止恩沙顿，但他们的干预导致祭祀出了大问题--利维坦被激怒了，神庙开始发洪水。当崇拜者被淹没时，队伍看到恩沙顿变成了他的真身，一个巨大的伊克西塔奇特人。当神庙的一堵墙倒塌，利维坦苏醒后产生的巨大潮汐将他们分开时，队伍被冲出了汹涌的阿西瓦特尔。",

	"As the party debates what to do, Axihuatl appears in human form. The Leviathan now threatens to destroy the entire world, and even the evil ixitxachitl doesn't wish to see that happen. He offers to teach the party how to put the Leviathan back to sleep.

Axihuatl says that once it is returned to slumber, the Leviathan cannot be awakened again for a thousand years.": "就在大家争论该怎么办的时候，Axihuatl以人形出现。利维坦现在威胁着要毁灭整个世界，即使是邪恶的ixitxachitl也不希望看到这种情况发生。他提出要教大家如何让利维坦重新睡去。他说，既然他是唤醒利维坦的人，就必须有另一个人让它恢复睡眠，而党是唯一可以信任的团体。Axihuatl说，一旦它恢复沉睡，利维坦在一千年内都不能再被唤醒。",
	"Axihuatl might even be willing to accompany the party, though given his nature this might not be the best alternative. The characters must find the Leviathan, enter the temple, and make their way to the lowest level, where they can dispose of the Abyssal Shard (Encounters 2 and 3).": "Axihuatl甚至可能愿意陪伴他们，不过鉴于他的本性，这可能不是最好的选择。角色们必须找到利维坦，进入神庙，并前往最低层，在那里他们可以处理深渊碎片（遭遇2和3）。",
	"If the party succeeds, the Leviathan goes back to sleep. Though seriously damaged by the Leviathan's movement, the world survives.

	"The Leviathan has exerted its influence on the world of Eberron since the Age of Dragons.

	"In a Spelljammer campaign, The Leviathan can still be ran as normal; its body wraps around a given planet, and if roused, it will reduce that planet to rubble.

	"In a planar campaign, perhaps The Leviathan's body spans multiple planes as the River Styx does.

The upper levels are inert now—none of the chaos effects continue.": "在{@item Abyssal Shard|EdE}消失在坑里之后，利维坦的动作突然停止，因为它慢慢地恢复了沉睡。如果利维坦的那一面还活着，它就会消失在蓝白色斑点的漩涡中。任何幸存的深层潜伏者都会逃离。队伍必须游出脊柱神庙，升到地面上才能逃脱。上层现在是惰性的--没有任何混乱的影响继续存在。",
	"If the shard-carrier was swallowed and perishes in the aspect of the Leviathan's gizzard, the creature fights on for several rounds, giving the party the chance of retrieving the shard, then vanishes into the Pit. Either this means that the party has failed and the world is doomed, or (more optimistically) the Shard reaches the heart of the Leviathan and merges with its creator, sending the great beast back to sleep.": "如果携带碎片的人被吞下，并在利维坦的胃肠中灭亡，那么这个生物会继续战斗几个回合，让党有机会取回碎片，然后消失在坑中。要么这意味着党派已经失败，世界注定要毁灭，要么（更乐观的是）碎片到达利维坦的心脏，与它的创造者融合，让这个伟大的野兽重新睡去。",
	"Axihuatl's reaction to the party's success is up to the DM. If he escapes, he either disappears or goes on to hatch more schemes against civilization.": "Axihuatl对党的成功的反应由DM决定。如果他逃脱了，他要么消失，要么继续策划更多反对文明的计划。",
	"Once the characters have emerged, they find the world profoundly changed, since the Leviathan's rampage displaced oceans and sent mountain ranges tumbling. Despite the disaster, the world survived and will recover.": "一旦人物出现，他们发现世界发生了深刻的变化，因为 \"利维坦 \"的横冲直撞使海洋流离失所，山脉崩塌。尽管发生了这场灾难，世界还是幸存了下来，并将恢复。",
	"They brought it. They brought it and trapped it, though many gave their lives to do so. They brought it to threaten the gods, which they did. And the gods responded. But the evil remains, imprisoned. Biding. Planning. Seething.": "他们带来了它。他们带来了它并困住了它，尽管许多人为此付出了生命。他们带着它来威胁诸神，他们做到了。而诸神也做出了回应。但邪恶仍然存在，被囚禁。韬光养晦。计划。愤怒。",
	"Lured to the Material Plane by an ancient civilization hoping to protect itself from the vengeance of deities, Pandorym personifies the emotionless void of utter annihilation. It was imprisoned by its summoners millennia ago as a deterrent but never released. Now, hidden in a forgotten prison, the godslaying weapon awaits the arrival of a being powerful enough to reunite its awesome mind with its potent body. Pandorym seeks freedom—and with it, mass deicide.": "潘多瑞姆被一个希望保护自己不受神灵报复的古老文明引诱到物质世界，它是彻底毁灭的无感情的虚空的化身。几千年前，它被召唤者囚禁起来，作为一种威慑，但从未被释放。现在，隐藏在一个被遗忘的监狱里，这个弑神的武器等待着一个强大到足以让它强大的心灵与它强大的身体重新结合的人的到来。潘多里克寻求自由--随之而来的是大规模杀神。",
	"Long ago, a cabal of foolish wizards violated the laws of the multiverse in their search for ever-greater power, discovering spaces \"between\" the planes that should never have been breached. Their arrogance angered the deities, who jealously coveted this knowledge. To defend themselves (and incidentally, their people), the cabal members sought a weapon with which to threaten the gods. The wizards bent their wills toward a quas-ireality best described as \"perpendicular\" to that of the Great Wheel. The dark enticement of the chance to slay deities called to the Material Plane a sentient singularity of scarcely fathomable power and unrelenting destructiveness.": "很久以前，一帮愚蠢的巫师在寻找更强大的力量时违反了多元宇宙的法则，发现了 \"介于 \"各个星球之间的空间，而这些空间本不应该被破坏。他们的傲慢激怒了神灵，他们嫉妒地觊觎着这些知识。为了保护自己（顺便说一下，他们的人民），阴谋集团成员寻求一种武器来威胁诸神。巫师们将他们的意志转向一种最好的、被描述为与大轮回 \"垂直 \"的准绳。杀死神灵的机会所带来的黑暗诱惑将一个有生命的奇异体召唤到物质世界，它的力量几乎无法估量，而且具有无情的破坏力。",
	"Given the name Pandorym by its summoners, it sought greedily to fulfill the terms of its contract, but was instead imprisoned. Knowing they couldn't hold Pandorym's full might with magic—mortal or divine—they cleaved its alien psyche from its body, trapping the former in a crystal prison beneath their city and the latter in a transdimensional space that touches the multiverse at only one point.": "召唤者给它取名潘多瑞姆，它贪婪地寻求履行契约的条款，但却被囚禁起来。他们知道自己无法用魔法--无论是不朽的还是神圣的--来控制潘多拉姆的全部力量，于是他们把它的外星精神与它的身体分割开来，把前者困在他们城市下面的一个水晶监狱里，把后者困在一个只与多元宇宙接触的跨维空间中。",
	"In their hubris, those who brought Pandorym called on the deities aligned against them, revealing only a hint of their weapon's unbelievable destructiveness. The wizards believed such a display would force the gods to relent. Instead, the deities struck first. What would stop a single member of that insolent cabal from being consumed by madness and reuniting the halves of Pandorym? Thus, before the cabal could consolidate its position, the gods blotted every trace of it from the world.": "在他们的傲慢中，那些带来潘多瑞姆的人召唤了与他们结盟的神灵，只透露了他们武器难以置信的破坏力的一丝信息。巫师们相信这样的展示会迫使神灵们松口。相反，神灵们先下手为强。有什么能阻止那个无礼的阴谋集团的一个成员被疯狂所吞噬，并使潘多拉姆的两半重新结合？因此，在阴谋集团能够巩固其地位之前，诸神从世界上抹去了它的一切痕迹。",
	"Ancient deities who remember that fearful time occasionally speak to their modern clerics of their decision, striking fear into the hearts of their followers. Having wiped out the wizards and their civilization, the gods could not undo what the cabal had achieved. Thus, they were forced to hide away Pandorym in its dual prisons and erase all known records of the thing's existence. Nevertheless, tales persist of the weapon that kills gods, and they hint at its location.": "记得那个恐惧时代的古代神灵偶尔会对他们的现代神职人员说起他们的决定，让他们的追随者心中感到恐惧。在消灭了巫师和他们的文明之后，诸神无法挽回阴谋集团的成就。因此，他们被迫将潘多拉姆藏在它的双重监狱中，并抹去了所有关于这东西存在的已知记录。然而，关于杀死神灵的武器的传说仍然存在，并且暗示了它的位置。",
	"Despite the seals that hold its mind within the crystalline prison, Pandorym remains conscious and aware of its surroundings. Deathless and bored, it eagerly latches onto the psyche of any sentient creature that wanders too close, attempting to reunite its mind and body. But these mortal pawns are too fragile to endure its control. To its eternal frustration, the crushing power of its mind breaks its servants long before they can perform any helpful action. Until, that is, very recently.": "尽管它的思想被封在水晶监狱里，但潘多拉姆仍然有意识，并能意识到周围的环境。它没有死亡，也很无聊，它急切地抓住任何有生命的生物的心灵，试图让它的思想和身体重新结合起来。但这些凡人的棋子太脆弱了，无法忍受它的控制。让它永远感到沮丧的是，在它的仆人能够采取任何有用的行动之前，它心灵的压迫力早就把他们打垮了。直到最近，也就是最近。",
	"Pandorym seeks, above all else, the reunion of its potent mind with its unstoppable form.": "Pandorym首先寻求的是其强大的思想与不可阻挡的形式的重合。",
	"From those whose minds held up—at least for a time—to the impossible might of its psyche, the terrible weapon has learned of the destruction of its betrayers. It suspects that descendants might yet exist of those who lured and snared it, and once it achieves freedom, Pandorym will seek revenge on those innocents for the crimes of their ancestors.": "从那些心智健全的人那里--至少在一段时间内，它的精神力量是不可能的，这个可怕的武器已经知道了它的背叛者的毁灭情况。它怀疑那些引诱和诱捕它的人可能还有后代，一旦它获得自由，潘多拉姆将为他们祖先的罪行向这些无辜的人复仇。",
	"After it slakes its thirst for vengeance, Pandorym intends to complete its end of the bargain it struck millennia ago. Although Pandorym's summoners didn't respect that binding covenant, the quasi-living weapon possesses an unremitting sense of honor. It will fulfill its contract by obliterating every deity it finds in this reality. It knows that gods can't easily die, but it plans to rip them from existence.": "在满足了对复仇的渴望之后，Pandorym打算完成它在千年前达成的交易。虽然Pandorym的召唤者没有尊重那个有约束力的契约，但这个准生命武器拥有一种不懈的荣誉感。它将履行它的契约，消灭它在这个现实中发现的每一个神灵。它知道神灵不可能轻易死去，但它计划将它们从存在中撕毁。",
	"Once it has finished these tasks, Pandorym will return to its home reality—if it can. If it is prevented from leaving the multiverse, whether through a conscious act or because the rift created to summon it cannot be remade, Pandorym will end the Material Plane, one world at a time.": "一旦它完成了这些任务，Pandorym就会回到它的家乡--如果它可以的话。如果它被阻止离开多元宇宙，无论是通过有意识的行为，还是因为为召唤它而创造的裂缝无法被重塑，潘多拉姆将结束物质世界，一次一个世界。",
	"Either the mind or the body of Pandorym alone is powerful enough to end a campaign. If the two are brought together, the alien weapon would be unstoppable. A reunited Pandorym should lead to the end of the campaign world.": "无论是潘多拉姆的思想还是身体，都足以结束一场运动。如果两者结合起来，这个外星武器将是不可阻挡的。一个团聚的Pandorym应该会导致运动世界的结束。",

	"{@b SPL 5:} Tune Majii (NG female human {@creature mage}) is concerned about the recent disappearance of her father, Lucather. She has been in contact with the party before, perhaps as an employer, and is known to be reliable and helpful. She approaches them with a tale of sorrow and a promise of a rich reward. She asks the party to discover the current whereabouts of her father, who was last known to be exploring a certain set of ruins. The trail has gone cold, and the party begins to trace the old man's movements.": "{@b SPL 5:} Tune Majii (NG female human {@creature mage})对她父亲Lucather最近的失踪感到担忧。她以前曾与该组织接触过，也许是作为雇主，而且众所周知，她是可靠的、乐于助人的。她向他们讲述了一个悲伤的故事，并承诺会有丰厚的报酬。她要求党派发现她父亲目前的下落，据悉她父亲最后一次是在探索某片废墟。这条线索已经消失了，一行人开始追踪这位老人的行踪。",
	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} In an occurrence seemingly unrelated to the concerns of Tune Majii, a council of clerics has convened. Their deities have warned them of an unknown being that is attempting to release an imprisoned evil of unimaginable power. One of the characters (a cleric, paladin, or other divine spellcaster) receives word from a representative of their faith; if the party lacks a divine spellcaster, use a religious NPC that is allied with the party instead. The party is tasked to hunt down and stop this threat, but little is known of its nature.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):}在一个似乎与Tune Majii的关注无关的事件中，一个神职人员理事会已经召开。他们的神灵警告他们，一个未知的存在正试图释放一个被囚禁的、具有无法想象的力量的恶魔。其中一个角色（牧师、圣骑士或其他神圣的施法者）从他们的信仰代表那里得到了消息；如果队伍中没有神圣的施法者，可以用一个与队伍结盟的宗教NPC代替。党派的任务是追捕并阻止这一威胁，但对其性质所知甚少。",
	"At the same time, barely perceptible arcane glyphs appear in the night sky. Conjurers report difficulty casting spells, and an emergency meeting of sages is called. The arcane casters suspect a weakening connection with the rest of the multiverse, which might be related to these signs.": "同时，夜空中出现了几乎无法察觉的奥术字形。巫师们报告说施法困难，并召集了一次紧急的圣人会议。奥术师们怀疑与多元宇宙的联系正在减弱，这可能与这些迹象有关。",
	"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} The characters discover that the being they seek is a misguided agent of supreme law who does not view its objective as an evil or foolish act.": "{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} 人物发现他们寻找的存在是一个被误导的最高法律代理人，他不认为其目标是邪恶或愚蠢的行为。",
	"Meanwhile, the nocturnal glyphs become more prevalent and numerous, as the bonds connecting the Material Plane to other planes continue to weaken. Summoned creatures do not automatically return home, and advanced spellcasters find that their methods of teleportation have become somewhat unreliable.": "同时，由于连接物质界和其他位面的纽带继续减弱，夜行石刻变得更加普遍和众多。被召唤的生物不会自动回家，而高级施法者发现他们的传送方法变得有些不可靠。",
	"{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} The party learns the identity of both the rogue agent and the being it wishes to release.

The characters might have run across the creature earlier but not realized that it was their adversary.": "{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} 党派了解到流氓特工和它想释放的人的身份。一个被称为Obligatum VII的Kolyarut认为它受法律约束，必须释放被囚禁的Pandorym。角色们可能在之前碰到过这个生物，但没有意识到它是他们的对手。",
	"The arcane seals are bright enough to be seen at all hours. Teleportation becomes much riskier, and divine spellcasters lose contact with their deities.": "奥术封印的亮度足以让人在任何时候都能看到。传送变得更加危险，神圣的施法者与他们的神灵失去联系。",
	"{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):} Obsessed with her father's fate, Tune Majii contacts the party again. She has discovered Lucather's location. Further, she knows he serves a being of utter evil. She intends to halt whatever foul plans his master have concocted and insists that the characters help. The party might have discovered that the being Lucather serves is the same one that Obligatum VII seeks to release.": "{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):} 痴迷于她父亲的命运，Tune Majii再次联系党。她已经发现了卢卡瑟的位置。此外，她知道他为一个极端邪恶的生物服务。她打算阻止他的主人所制定的任何邪恶计划，并坚持要求人物帮忙。党派可能已经发现，卢卡瑟所服务的生物正是奥布利加图姆七世想要释放的那个。",
	"Following Tune's lead, the party descends through the ruins above the prison. Within, they discover Obligatum VII chipping away at the crystal holding Pandorym's consciousness. The damage allows a mind shard of Pandorym to form. Even this fragment is powerful enough to present a terrible threat. The characters must contend with this horror, the relentless kolyarut, and an enraged Lucather (what is left of him).": "跟随图恩的脚步，一行人穿过监狱上方的废墟下山。在里面，他们发现奥布利加图姆七世正在削去存放潘多拉姆意识的水晶。这种破坏使得潘多拉姆的思想碎片得以形成。即使这个碎片也足够强大，构成了一个可怕的威胁。角色们必须与这个恐怖的东西、无情的科里亚鲁特和被激怒的卢卡瑟（他剩下的部分）抗衡。",
	"Pandorym might be entombed beneath the Mournland, perhaps holding secrets to that mysterious devastation. Alternatively, the giants of Xen'drik might have lured and entrapped Pandorym during the height of their power thousands of years ago. Now its crystalline prison is buried under one of their many ruins on that jungle continent.": "潘多瑞姆可能被埋藏在哀伤之地的地下，也许掌握着那场神秘的破坏的秘密。或者，Xen'drik的巨人可能在几千年前他们力量最强大的时候引诱并困住了Pandorym。现在，它的结晶监狱被埋在他们在那片丛林大陆上的众多废墟中的一个下面。",
	"In the first scenario, Pandorym could be the reason for the Day of Mourning. (Since no one officially knows the cause of that cataclysm, you're free to interpret the event in any way that works for your campaign.) This explanation requires you to advance the timeline of Pandorym's arrival in Khorvaire to only a few years before the beginning of the campaign. In this scenario, House Cannith, in cooperation with Cyre, brought the alien weapon to Eberron to challenge the gods and to end the Last War for good. As a result of Cyre's hubris, the gods—or perhaps some other power—destroyed the kingdom utterly, creating the Mournland.": "在第一种情况下，潘多瑞姆可能是哀悼日的原因。(由于没有人正式知道那场大灾难的原因，你可以自由地以任何适合你的活动的方式来解释这一事件）。这个解释要求你把潘多拉姆到达霍尔韦尔的时间线提前到战役开始前的几年。在这种情况下，坎尼斯家族与赛尔合作，将外星武器带到了埃伯龙，以挑战诸神并永远结束最后的战争。由于赛尔的傲慢，诸神--或许是其他力量--彻底摧毁了这个王国，创造了哀牢。",
	"As described in the novel {@i Darkvision}, the ancient Imaskaran Empire brought Pandorym to Faerûn to prevent the deities from seeking vengeance for the Imaskari's genocide. Before they could use their weapon, though, the gods laid low the whole empire. Pandorym remains to this day, its mind entrapped within the Imperial Weapon Cache under the Palace of the Purple Emperor.": "正如小说中所描述的那样（%0%），古老的伊马斯卡兰帝国将潘多瑞姆带到了法鲁恩，以防止神灵为伊马斯卡里的种族屠杀寻求报复。不过，在他们使用武器之前，诸神让整个帝国陷入低谷。潘多瑞姆至今仍在，它的思想被禁锢在紫禁城宫殿下的帝国武器库中。",
	"Due to the planar nature of Obligatum VII and Pandorym's Seal of Binding sign, it would be very easy to run a Pandorym campaign in a planar setting such as Planescape. As the sign intensifies, planar travel becomes harder and harder, requiring Obligatum and the party to rely on pre-existing portals (such as those in the city of Sigil) in order to traverse the planes before even they cease to function. In such a campaign, Pandorym's prison might be on a secret demiplane created by its summoners, or it could be found in a remote location on one of the known planes of existence.": "由于Obligatum VII和Pandorym的束缚之印标志的平面性，在诸如Planescape这样的平面环境中开展Pandorym活动是非常容易的。随着标志的加强，平面旅行变得越来越难，要求Obligatum和队伍依靠预先存在的传送门（比如Sigil城的传送门），以便在它们停止运作之前穿越各个平面。在这样的战役中，潘多拉姆的监狱可能在其召唤者创造的秘密半位面，也可能在已知存在的某个位面的偏远位置找到。",
	"In a Spelljammer campaign, perhaps the Seal of Binding sign extends to travel between crystal spheres as well. When the sign becomes overwhelming, portals to other spheres cease to function altogether, causing each sphere to be isolated from one another. In this case, Pandorym's prison would reside in some unknown sphere, perhaps on an abandoned planet or in an isolated space station in wildpsace where Pandorym's summoners once resided.": "在 \"咒怨 \"活动中，也许 \"束缚之印 \"的标志也会延伸到水晶球之间的旅行。当这个标志变得不堪一击时，通往其他球体的门户就会完全停止运作，导致每个球体都被彼此隔离。在这种情况下，潘多瑞姆的监狱将居住在某个未知的球体中，也许是在一个废弃的星球上，或者是在潘多瑞姆的召唤者曾经居住的Wildpsace的一个孤立的空间站中。",
	"Elaborate on the method through which Pandorym's prison is discovered; after all, the original timeline left this purposefully vague as to allow DMs to come up with their own process. Perhaps certain artifacts are scattered throughout the setting, and each one gives a clue as to where Pandorym's mind (or body) is located. Anyone that wields all of these artifacts would instantly discover the location of Pandorym's mind (or body), making them highly desirable for Obligatum VII and any other faction out there.": "详述发现潘多里克的监狱的方法；毕竟，原始的时间线故意把这个问题含糊其辞，以便让DM想出他们自己的过程。也许某些神器散落在整个环境中，每件神器都能提供潘多拉姆的思想（或身体）所在的线索。任何拥有所有这些神器的人都会立刻发现潘多拉姆的思想（或身体）的位置，从而使他们对奥布利加图姆七世和其他任何派别都非常渴望。",
	"Add additional restrictions as to how Pandorym's mind can be freed. By default, the crystalline prison can be attacked via any adamantine or magical weapon, and is protected mostly by its secret location and hostile guardians. However, you may wish to create a specific weapon, spell, or other object or process that acts as the only way to destroy the prison. Whatever the requirement is, the story would involve Obligatum's quest to satisfy it, as well as the party's attempts to stop it from succeeding.": "对于如何释放潘多拉姆的思想，添加额外的限制。默认情况下，晶石监狱可以通过任何金刚砂或魔法武器进行攻击，并且主要由其秘密位置和敌对的守护者进行保护。然而，你可能希望创造一种特定的武器、咒语、或其他物体或过程，作为摧毁监狱的唯一途径。无论要求是什么，故事将涉及Obligatum为满足它而进行的探索，以及党为阻止它成功而进行的尝试。",
	"Use Pandorym's body as part of the story. While Pandorym's sphere of annihilation-esque body normally can't be controlled, perhaps a special talisman was created by its summoners in order to move it to its current hiding place. With this talisman, any entity or faction could use Pandorym's body as an unstoppable weapon, assuming that they can find the body in the first place. Maybe Obligatum itself seeks Pandorym's body so that it may destroy the crystalline prison that houses Pandorym's mind, allowing Pandorym to become whole again much sooner than anticipated.": "用潘多拉姆的身体作为故事的一部分。虽然潘多里克的湮灭之球般的身体通常不能被控制，但也许它的召唤者创造了一个特殊的护身符，以便把它移到现在的藏身之处。有了这个护身符，任何实体或派别都可以将潘多拉姆的身体作为一种不可阻挡的武器，前提是他们首先要找到这个身体。也许Obligatum自己也在寻找潘多拉姆的身体，这样它就可以摧毁容纳潘多拉姆思想的晶体监狱，让潘多拉姆比预期的更快地重新变得完整。",
	"Pandorym's physical component does not truly exist as a body in the multiverse but is a conduit to the incomprehensible reality of its home. It manifests as a 30-foot-diameter black sphere that hovers in space, similar to a {@item sphere of annihilation}.": "Pandorym的物理组件并不真正作为一个身体存在于多元宇宙中，而是一个通往其家园的不可理解的现实的管道。它表现为一个直径30英尺的黑色球体，在太空中盘旋，类似于一个（%0%）。",
	"The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it, except for deities. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes {@damage 10d10} force damage.": "球体会抹去它所经过的所有物质，以及所有经过它的物质，除了神灵。其他接触到球体但没有被它完全吞噬和湮灭的东西都会受到{@damage 10d10}的力量伤害。",
	"No being—not even a deity—can control it, even using a {@item talisman of the sphere}. Any attempt to control the Gargantuan sphere instead causes it to slide 90 feet toward the creature. When this happens, each creature in its path can attempt a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the sphere passes through the creature, either destroying or heavily damaging it as described above. On a successful save, a creature can use its reaction to move barely out of the way of the sphere.": "没有任何生物--甚至是神灵--能够控制它，即使是使用（%0%）。任何试图控制巨大球体的行为都会导致它向生物体滑行90英尺。当这种情况发生时，在其路径上的每个生物都可以尝试一个DC23的灵巧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，球体就会穿过生物，要么摧毁它，要么如上所述严重损害它。拯救成功时，生物可以用它的反应来勉强移开球体的方式。",
	"The ancient wizards hid Pandorym's body in a secret location far from the crystalline prison that holds its mind.": "古老的巫师们把潘多拉姆的身体藏在一个秘密的地方，远离关押其思想的水晶监狱。",
	"The mind of Pandorym, even imprisoned, presents a subtle and sinister challenge. While it is imprisoned, Pandorym's consciousness is defined entirely by the crystals that trap it. The intensity of the prison's purple glow wanes and waxes in a rhythmic pattern. At times, the crystal seems to pull light into itself rather than radiate it. Occasionally, when it grows especially dark, a malevolent purple-red glow appears deep within. At those times, the alien mind seems to be aware and focused—if only briefly. Fortunately for the world, the crystalline prison is exceedingly difficult to damage.": "潘多瑞姆的思想，即使被囚禁，也是一个微妙而险恶的挑战。当它被囚禁时，潘多瑞姆的意识完全被困住它的水晶所定义。监狱里的紫色光芒的强度以一种有节奏的模式减弱和消退。有时，水晶似乎会把光拉到自己身上，而不是放射出来。偶尔，当它变得特别黑暗时，内部深处会出现恶毒的紫红色光辉。在那些时候，外星人的思想似乎是有意识的，而且很集中--尽管只是短暂的。对这个世界来说，幸运的是，这个晶体监狱极难被破坏。",
	"If released without a body to focus its energy, Pandorym's psyche spreads like a stain across reality, becoming a sphere 40 feet in diameter. Its incorporeal emptiness stretches thin, and around its edges it resembles a wispy cloud of lightlessness. Vaporous tendrils form and dissipate at random at this boundary. This irregular ball has no discernible front, back, or sides, and rotates slowly on a tilted axis. It seems to drift along, even when moving at top speed. Chill breezes, strong enough to make candles flicker but not extinguish, rise within 5 feet. When Pandorym deigns to communicate telepathically, a dim glow emanates from its center.": "如果没有身体来集中它的能量，潘多拉姆的精神就会像污点一样在现实中扩散，成为一个直径40英尺的球体。它的无体的空虚延伸得很细，在它的边缘，它就像一朵无光的飘渺的云。蒸腾的卷轴在这个边界处随机形成和消散。这个不规则的球没有明显的正面、背面或侧面，在一个倾斜的轴上缓慢旋转。它似乎在漂移，即使以最高速度移动。寒冷的微风，足以使蜡烛闪烁但不熄灭，在5英尺内升起。当Pandorym决定用心灵感应时，它的中心会发出暗淡的光亮。",

A human-shaped being of metal stands near the massive crystal, chipping away at it with a sword.": "一块紫色的水晶主宰着这个房间的中心，跳动着一种邪恶的黑暗，似乎在吸食光线。它邪恶的光芒使一切都笼罩在病态的紫色阴影中。一个人形的金属生物站在巨大的水晶附近，用一把剑削掉它。",
	"With his Obligatum VII is focused on releasing Pandorym's imprisoned mind. The kolyarut's adamantine longsword allows it to deal an average of about 100 damage to the crystalline prison per round, assuming that it hits all four of its attacks. By the time the party arrives, it has already dealt 50 damage to the prison, meaning that it requires two more rounds before a mind shard of Pandorym has the potential to emerge.": "用他的奥布利加图姆七号专注于释放潘多拉姆被囚禁的思想。科利亚鲁特的金刚长剑让它每回合平均对结晶监狱造成约100的伤害，假设它的四次攻击都能命中。当队伍到达时，它已经对监狱造成了50次伤害，这意味着在潘多拉姆的心灵碎片有可能出现之前还需要两轮。",
	"If the crystalline prison takes 100 damage or more on a single turn for two rounds in a row, or if it takes 200 or more damage in a single round, it cracks and sends forth a mind shard of Pandorym. If you want to present a more difficult challenge for the party, change this encounter so that Obligatum VII has already dealt 200 damage to the prison and released a mind shard, and that it is well on its way to shattering the crystal.": "如果结晶监狱连续两轮单次受到100点或更多的伤害，或者单轮受到200点或更多的伤害，它就会裂开并释放出一个潘多拉姆的心灵碎片。如果你想给队伍带来更困难的挑战，可以改变这个遭遇，让奥布利加图姆七世已经对监狱造成了200次伤害，并释放了一个心灵碎片，而且它正朝着粉碎水晶的方向发展。",
	"The kolyarut is single-minded in its task, but it takes steps to defend itself if it is reduced to half of its hit points or fewer. Even then, if allies protect the inevitable it continues its assault on the crystalline prison regardless of its injuries.": "kolyarut一心一意地执行任务，但如果它的命中率降到一半或更低，它就会采取措施保护自己。即使如此，如果盟友保护了不可避免的，它就会不顾自己的伤势，继续对水晶监狱进行攻击。",

They focus on one or two physically weak foes, using their Life Drain attacks to kill their opponents and swell their own numbers.": "裹尸人彼此合作，并与卢卡瑟（如果他仍然存在的话）一起保卫不可避免的东西，但他们不一定与奥布利加图姆七世或心灵碎片合作。他们专注于一两个身体虚弱的敌人，利用他们的生命耗尽攻击来杀死对手并膨胀自己的数量。",
	"If a mind shard forms, it immediately defends Obligatum VII or any other creatures attacking the prison. It concentrates on heavily armored foes (such as fighters or other combat specialists), leaving physically weaker opponents to the dread wraiths and Lucather. Keep in mind that its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are both 30, meaning that it is smart enough to determine the best course of action against the party, just as the DM is familiar enough with their party and players to metagame against them.": "如果一个心灵碎片形成，它就会立即为奥布加图姆七世或任何其他攻击监狱的生物进行防御。它专注于重甲敌人（如战士或其他战斗专家），把身体较弱的对手留给可怕的裹尸布和卢卡瑟。请记住，它的智力和智慧分数都是30分，这意味着它足够聪明，可以确定针对党派的最佳行动方案，就像DM对他们的党派和玩家足够熟悉，可以对他们进行元化。",
	"A great circle of binding covers the floor of this circular hallway, enclosed entirely within the outer circle. Passing over its engraved lines shifts a corporeal creature's body to Pandorym's native reality for a few seconds.

	"If the characters fail to stop Obligatum VII, it releases the imprisoned mind of Pandorym. The freed entity's psyche is nearly impossible to defeat. It directs Obligatum VII to the dimensional prison housing Pandorym's body, where the two parts of the alien weapon will be reunited. The journey to this location takes some time, and the gods might be convinced to intervene. If they cannot or will not, Pandorym will fulfill its contract and destroy the campaign setting.": "如果人物未能阻止Obligatum VII，它就会释放被囚禁的潘多拉姆的思想。被释放的实体的心理几乎不可能被打败。它将Obligatum VII引向存放Pandorym身体的维度监狱，在那里，外星武器的两个部分将被重新组合。到这个地方的旅程需要一些时间，众神可能被说服进行干预。如果他们不能或不愿意，Pandorym就会履行它的契约，并摧毁这个活动环境。",
	"Even if the party is victorious, the crèche-forges of Mechanus churn out Obligatum VIII in {@dice 2d4} months.

	"Until recently, knowledge of Ragnorra had been lost to mortals. Now, sketchy reports have begun circulating in scholarly circles of runes in the silver sky of the Astral Plane. Some claim these signs warn of the return of Ragnorra, and their stories are now given more credence than ridicule.": "直到最近，凡人已经失去了对Ragnorra的了解。现在，关于星界银色天空中的符文的粗略报告已经开始在学术界流传。有些人声称这些标志警告着拉格诺拉的回归，他们的故事现在被赋予了更多的可信度而不是嘲笑。",
	"Ancient tales refer to the Mother of Monsters, a gigantic, unnatural creature that birthed horrors that plagued the early worlds. The gods cast this awful thing into the space between the planes. With the world rid of her creatures, they were free to create the mortal races. Scholars have partially deciphered the runes that summarize this history. Most claim they herald the return of Ragnorra.": "古老的传说提到了怪物之母，一个巨大的、非自然的生物，孕育了困扰早期世界的恐怖。诸神将这个可怕的东西扔进了各星球之间的空间。随着世界摆脱了她的生物，他们可以自由地创造凡人种族。学者们已经部分地破译了总结这段历史的符文。大多数人声称它们预示着Ragnorra的回归。",
	"A vocal minority of planar scholars claim the runes tell not one tale, but many. Each rune has been written atop a previous one, incorporating the earlier rune in its form. The runes' gigantic size suggests that the story of Ragnorra has been told many times, rewritten each time she is to appear. Each of the prior tales ends in the extinguishing of mortal races on a world and the corruption of all its life.": "少数有发言权的平面学者声称，符文讲述的不是一个故事，而是许多故事。每一个符文都是在前一个符文的基础上写成的，在形式上融入了前一个符文。符文的巨大尺寸表明，Ragnorra的故事已经被讲述了很多次，每次她出现都会被改写。之前的每一个故事都以一个世界上凡人种族的灭绝和所有生命的腐败而告终。",
	"Moving between the planes, Ragnorra appears about once every 1,500 years on the Material Plane. Her arrival takes the form of a fiery red comet. The astral runes are not a warning so much as a \"signpost\" that points out Ragnorra's path to the next world.": "在不同的位面之间移动，拉格诺拉大约每1500年在物质位面出现一次。她的到来是以一颗火红色的彗星的形式出现。星际符文不是一个警告，而是一个 \"路标\"，指出了拉格诺拉通往下一个世界的道路。",
	"Ragnorra is a twisted, irresistible force of creation. She exists to spawn life in her own terrible image. Legends tell of her spores raining down upon worlds to fester. The spores parasitize plants and animals, raising blisters that birth monsters, killing the hosts. Even inanimate objects sprout hideous creatures. Some unfortunate sentients infected by spores become aberrant hybrids.": "Ragnorra是一种扭曲的、不可抗拒的创造力量。她的存在是为了以她自己的可怕形象催生生命。传说中，她的孢子雨点般落在世界上发酵。孢子寄生在植物和动物身上，长出水泡，产生怪物，杀死宿主。即使是无生命的物体也会萌发出可怕的生物。一些被孢子感染的不幸的有生命的人成为反常的混血儿。",
	"Ragnorra is a vast intelligence, but not a conscious one. She operates on intuition, dreaming inexplicably deep plans. Destruction is not her purpose, but rather undoing the \"errors\" of the gods and reshaping all life according to her own vision. That this horrid new order is contradictory, destructive, and painful to her progeny does not matter to her.": "拉格诺拉是一个巨大的智慧，但不是一个有意识的智慧。她凭直觉行事，做着莫名其妙的深刻计划。毁灭不是她的目的，而是要消除众神的 \"错误\"，并按照她自己的设想重塑所有生命。这种可怕的新秩序对她的后代来说是矛盾的、破坏性的和痛苦的，这对她来说并不重要。",
	"Ragnorra is no longer content with merely seeding a world from above. She now prepares it by crashing herself into the earth with enough force to raise a vast crater. The collision hurls dust and debris into the air, altering the climate and weakening existing life. Pieces of Ragnorra's own body rain down from the sky, spreading her awful fecundity around the world.": "Ragnorra不再满足于仅仅从上面播种一个世界。她现在准备用足够的力量把自己撞到地球上，形成一个巨大的火山口。碰撞将灰尘和碎片抛入空中，改变了气候，削弱了现有的生命。拉格诺拉自己身体的碎片从空中落下，将她可怕的繁殖力传播到全世界。",
	"A group of outsiders from several planes have formed a cult-like society, the Malshapers. Rather than fearing Ragnorra, they revere her power and guide her plans. They create a sort of trail through the multiverse, seeding it with life from a chosen world to lead the Mother of Monsters to her next target. Evidence of this trail manifests as runes in the Astral Plane.": "一群来自多个星球的外来者组成了一个类似邪教的社会，即马尔沙普斯。他们并不惧怕拉格诺拉，而是崇尚她的力量，引导她的计划。他们在多元宇宙中创造了一种线索，从一个被选中的世界中播撒生命，引导怪物之母找到她的下一个目标。这条线索的证据在星界表现为符文。",
	"Ragnorra's path is extraplanar, a twisted loop with one end anchored in the Positive Energy Plane. It curves through the Astral Plane and intersects with the Ethereal Plane, the Material Plane, or the Shadowfell before returning to its starting point. Each loop takes approximately 500 years. Ragnorra was exiled long before the deities created the mortal races, so the elder evil has been a potential threat for as long as the campaign setting has existed. Her current path is taking her toward the campaign world as the result of the Malshapers' actions to lead her there. This process can take anywhere from a few months to many years of game time, depending on the needs of the campaign.": "拉格诺拉的路径是平面外的，是一个扭曲的循环，一端固定在正能量位面。它弯弯曲曲地穿过星界，与虚空界、物质界或阴影地带相交，然后返回起点。每一次循环大约需要500年。拉格诺拉早在神灵创造凡人种族之前就被放逐了，所以只要活动背景存在，长老的邪恶就一直是一个潜在的威胁。她目前的道路正带着她走向战役世界，这是马尔沙普斯的行动将她引向那里的结果。这个过程可能需要几个月到很多年的游戏时间，这取决于活动的需要。",
	"Once Ragnorra emerges on the Material Plane, astrologers and astronomers quickly detect a fiery red comet where none had previously been recorded. The faint effect of her sign appears. Soon she is visible to the naked eye, dominating the night sky while the sign's effect strengthens. Ultimately, she crashes into the world, and the sign reaches its peak. At that point, the party has only a short time to deal with the threat.": "一旦拉格诺拉出现在物质界，占星家和天文学家很快就发现了一颗火红色的彗星，而此前没有任何记录。她的星座的微弱效应出现了。很快，她就被肉眼所见，主宰了夜空，而星座的效应也随之加强了。最终，她撞上了这个世界，标志也达到了顶峰。在这一点上，当事人只有很短的时间来处理这个威胁。",
	"Sometimes Ragnorra's target is another, nearby world. Her close passage leaves spores and corrupting influence in its wake, producing the effect of a moderate or strong sign, but does not culminate in a collision.": "有时拉格诺拉的目标是另一个附近的世界。她的近距离通过会留下孢子和腐败的影响，产生中度或强度征兆的效果，但不会最终导致碰撞。",
	"This sign manifests as a surge of corrupt positive energy that resculpts life on an entire world.": "这个标志表现为腐败的正能量的激增，挽救了整个世界的生命。",
	"{@b Faint:} When a creature magically regains hit points, it regains 5 additional hit points.": "{@b Faint:}当一个生物通过魔法恢复命中率时，它将恢复5点额外的命中率。",
	"{@b Moderate:} As faint, but in addition, warts and blemishes appear on living targets of those that magically regain hit points. These unsightly growths impose a -2 penalty on Charisma checks. Once per day, an affected creature can attempt a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the blemishes disappear, and the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.": "{@b Moderate:} 如同虚弱，但除此之外，疣和斑点会出现在那些以魔法恢复命中率的活体目标上。这些难看的生长物对魅力检查造成-2的惩罚。每天一次，受影响的生物可以尝试用DC15的体质测试来挽救。如果救治成功，斑点就会消失，并且该生物在24小时内对这个效果免疫。",
	"Additionally, spores fall to earth, taking root in rock, roofs, and the soil. Over time, such spores turn into cysts, abscesses, tumors, and other foul growths that dot the landscape. These features are identical to those of Ragnorra's Worldskin (see the Worldskin section later in this chapter). In particular, Spawning Spores will churn out progeny of Ragnorra who use these spores to birth even more horrible aberrations. If left unchecked, these worldskin features will overrun the landscape and will remake the environment as Ragnorra intended it to be.": "此外，孢子落到地上，在岩石、屋顶和土壤中生根。随着时间的推移，这些孢子会变成囊肿、脓肿、肿瘤和其他恶臭的生长物，点缀着整个景观。这些特征与拉格诺拉的世界之皮相同（见本章后面的世界之皮部分）。特别是，再生孢子会搅动出Ragnorra的后代，他们利用这些孢子诞生更多可怕的畸形。如果不加控制，这些世界皮肤的特征将泛滥成灾，并将重塑环境，使之成为拉格诺拉所期望的样子。",
	"{@b Strong:} As moderate, but the DC to remove blemishes increases to 18. Additionally, the surge of positive energy repairs flesh. Once per day, injured living creatures can use their action to magically regain 19 ({@dice 2d8 + 10}) hit points. Any creature that benefits from this healing must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition positive energy corruption|EdE}.": "{@b Strong:}与中度相同，但消除瑕疵的DC增加到18。此外，涌动的正能量可以修复肉体。每天一次，受伤的生物可以用他们的行动来神奇地恢复19({@dice 2d8 + 10})的打击点。任何受益于这种治疗的生物都必须在DC 15宪法救赎中获得成功，否则就会遭受一级的（%2%）。",
	"{@b Overwhelming:} As strong, but the DC of saving throws to remove blemishes or to avoid corruption increases to 20.

	"The overwhelming aura of positive energy is anathema to undead. Once per day, exposed undead must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 24 hours. When an undead of CR 3 or lower fails this saving throw, it is instead instantly destroyed. Undead can avoid this effect by remaining underground (minimum 15 feet depth) or within a stone or metallic vault whose walls are at least 15 feet thick, provided all entrances to the chamber are sealed.": "铺天盖地的正能量光环对亡灵来说是一种厌恶。每天一次，暴露的亡灵必须在DC20智慧救赎中成功，否则会被（%0%）24小时。当CR3或更低的亡灵没有成功，它就会被瞬间摧毁。亡灵可以通过呆在地下（至少15英尺深）或呆在墙壁至少15英尺厚的石头或金属拱顶内来避免这种效果，前提是房间的所有入口都被密封。",

Note that Ragnorra's Twisted Life sign has been altered, and that the progeny of Ragnorra template no longer has an Intelligence score requirement.": "原书中给出的可能的战役大纲没有改变，除了下面的描述。请注意，拉格诺拉的扭曲生命标志已经被改变，而且拉格诺拉的后代模板不再有智力分数要求。",
	"{@b SPL 5:} The Malshapers observe that Ragnorra is about to emerge from the Positive Energy Plane. They have chosen the campaign world as her destination and set in motion a plan to lead her there. {@creature Irthicax Vane|EdE} recruits minions for a gruesome \"scavenger hunt\" to gather living organisms, including members of sentient races, to entice Ragnorra along the chosen course.

	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} Stories abound of healing springs and mysterious adepts who control them. Throngs of people flock to the springs to be cured. The party is asked to investigate, perhaps by concerned authorities suspecting chicanery, or by a church or healing organization afraid of competition.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):}关于疗养泉和控制它们的神秘神职人员的故事比比皆是。成群结队的人涌向这些泉水，希望得到治愈。党派被要求进行调查，也许是有关当局怀疑有诈，或者是教会或治疗组织害怕竞争。",
	"Upon arrival, the characters quickly discover that the waters do seem to have a curative effect, but the springs are plagued by bizarre aberrations. The \"adepts\" at the healing springs are in fact agents of the Malshapers. They watch the characters and notify Irthicax Vane about their activities and effectiveness.": "抵达后，角色们很快发现，泉水似乎确实有治疗效果，但泉水被奇怪的反常现象所困扰。疗养泉的 \"信徒 \"实际上是Malshapers的代理人。他们监视着这些人物，并向伊尔西卡克斯-维恩通报他们的活动和效果。",
	"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} Reports of \"ghosts\" circulate in small cities. These mysterious entities seem to be doing no harm, but weird events occur soon after their appearance. Strange rain falls for several days, often from a cloudless sky. Doors swell and burst with rats, roofs spawn spiders, and bats erupt from the sides of temples. The visitors are Malshaper observers who report the party's investigations to Irthicax Vane. He warns his colleagues, who signal him to take action.": "{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} 关于 \"鬼魂 \"的报告在小城市流传。这些神秘的实体似乎没有造成任何伤害，但在他们出现后不久就发生了奇怪的事件。奇怪的雨下了好几天，经常从无云的天空中落下。门上的老鼠会膨胀并爆裂，屋顶会产生蜘蛛，蝙蝠会从寺庙的侧面喷出。来访者是马尔沙伯的观察员，他们向伊尔西卡克斯-瓦恩报告了党的调查。他警告他的同事，后者示意他采取行动。",
	"At the same time, powerful undead appear in the cities and destroy the swarms in an odd frenzy. If the characters parley with intelligent undead, they learn that the sudden swarms are a sign of a corrupt form of positive energy.": "与此同时，强大的亡灵出现在城市中，并在一种奇怪的狂热中摧毁了这些蜂群。如果人物与聪明的亡灵交谈，他们会了解到，突然出现的蜂群是一种腐败的正能量形式的标志。",

	"Meanwhile, Irthicax Vane makes his first move against the party, sending Malshaper agents against them while they are on this spying mission. The agents (typically generic humanoids such as {@creature thug|mm|thugs} and {@creature mage|mm|mages}) are no match for the party, though their numbers increase with every attack. They are disturbingly disfigured, with distended jaws, prominent or horned brows, protruding teeth, or extra tongues. After each attack, more of the strange rain falls. Greater swarms appear, along with ravaged corpses, some seemingly fallen from a great height.": "与此同时，伊尔西卡克斯-瓦恩（Irthicax Vane）对党派采取了第一次行动，在他们执行这次间谍任务时，派出了马尔沙普（Malshaper）特工来对付他们。这些特工（通常是普通的人形生物，如（%0%）和（%1%））不是党的对手，尽管他们的数量随着每次攻击而增加。他们被毁容得令人不安，下巴膨胀，眉毛突出或有角，牙齿突出，或有多余的舌头。每次攻击后，更多的怪雨会落下。更大的群落出现了，还有被蹂躏的尸体，有些似乎是从很高的地方掉下来的。",
	"After the last attack, the rains begin again. Then, an object falls from the sky, forming a small crater nearby. Malshaper corpses twitch with life, becoming aberrations that slither to the crater's edge. A few moments thereafter, an impossible horror emerges: an {@creature aboleth sarcoma|EdE}, a corrupted aboleth that has fused with the risen Malshapers and uses their enslaved bodies as \"legs\".": "在最后一次攻击之后，雨又开始了。然后，一个物体从天而降，在附近形成一个小火山口。马尔沙伯的尸体抽搐着，变成了畸形物，滑向火山口的边缘。片刻之后，一个不可能的恐怖出现了：一个{@creature aboleth sarcoma|EdE}，一个腐朽的阿波勒斯，它与复活的马尔沙佩尔融合在一起，把他们被奴役的身体当作 \"腿\"。",
	"{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):} Ragnorra, blazing with a miles-long tail of corrupted essence, slams into the world.

	"The force and heat of the collision spews pulverized earth into the atmosphere. This material, along with spores, ash, and fragments of Ragnorra's body, forms a towering plume visible across the continent.

	"Even the most ancient records of Ragnorra cannot agree on whether she was cast from the world during the Age of Dragons or the Age of Demons. Religious lore and astronomical evidence suggest that Ragnorra has made two passes over Eberron already, with a light seeding of spores during the Age of Giants and a heavier seeding during the Age of Monsters. A few scholars even speculate that warforged sentience resulted from Cannith experimentation with dormant spores recovered from Xen'drik.": "即使是最古老的关于拉格诺拉的记录也无法认同她是在龙的时代还是在魔的时代被赶出这个世界。宗教传说和天文证据表明，拉格诺拉已经在艾伯伦上空停留了两次，在巨人时代播撒了少量的孢子，在魔物时代播撒了更多的孢子。一些学者甚至猜测，战神的智商是由坎尼斯用从仙德里克回收的休眠孢子进行实验而产生的。",

	"Additionally, consider changing Ragnorra's extraterrestrial nature to fit your campaign setting. For example, you could change Ragnorra to be a dormant entity deep below the earth, hibernating until she can draw enough energy from the planet to awaken once more.

All he found was a lowly serpent, wallowing in the mire of a primeval fen.": "Sertrous就是这样一位obyrith领主，一个当时与寄生虫和爬行物有关的小恶魔领主。塞特鲁斯一直很叛逆，他杀死了所有来到他的深渊巢穴招募他加入女王的事业的恶魔。他对女王本人没有什么防备，女王很快就厌倦了他的不服从，摧毁了他的身体，并把他的精髓扔进了星球之间的海湾，就像人们扔掉一个尸体一样。然而，这并不意味着塞尔图斯的末日。当他的精华穿过物质世界时，塞尔图斯不顾一切地抓住了一个锚，以防止他进入外面的虚空。他所发现的只是一条卑微的蛇，在原始沼泽的泥沼中沉浮。",
	"For untold centuries, Sertrous lived as a serpent. At first, he was confined to that serpent's body. As he healed, his essence transformed the serpent into a new physicality that took on the madness of his previous demonic form. Yet he retained serpentine features—partially as a disguise if agents of the Queen encounter him. Sertrous watched from his fen as the mortal races grew civilized, established their own empires, and raised temples to honor the gods. Sertrous grew jealous of their prosperity and coveted the devotion mortals heaped upon the gods. And so he waged war on them, plaguing these first nations with armies of serpents and monsters from the fen.": "无数个世纪以来，塞尔图斯以蛇的身份生活。起初，他被限制在那条蛇的身体里。当他痊愈后，他的精气神将大蛇转化为新的体质，具有了他以前的恶魔形态的疯狂性。然而他保留了蛇的特征--部分是为了在女王的特工遇到他时进行伪装。塞特鲁斯在他的芬恩看着凡人种族的文明发展，建立了他们自己的帝国，并建立了纪念诸神的寺庙。瑟楚斯越来越嫉妒他们的繁荣，并觊觎凡人对诸神的虔诚。因此，他向他们发动了战争，用蛇的军队和来自沼泽的怪物困扰着这些最初的国家。",
	"When the beleaguered mortals called upon one of their deity's most powerful minions, the solar Avamerin, Sertrous claimed his first and greatest victory. Avamerin led a great army into the fen to destroy Sertrous. The obyrith's minions were evenly matched with the angel's, and in the end only the obyrith and the angel survived to face one another. The battle was intense, but in the end the solar defeated the serpent. As Avamerin raised his sword and prepared to strike the killing blow, Sertrous asked him a simple question: \"Why serve your lord when his playthings can gain the same strength of power through their own will?\" Avamerin struck then, slaying Sertrous. He returned to civilization with the obyrith's head as proof of his triumph and spoke to the nation's priests of the demon's foolish words.": "当被围困的凡人召唤他们神灵最强大的爪牙之一--太阳神阿瓦梅林时，塞尔图斯取得了他第一个也是最伟大的胜利。阿瓦梅林率领一支大军进入沼泽地，要消灭塞尔图斯。obyrith的爪牙与天使的爪牙势均力敌，最后只有obyrith和天使幸存下来，面对彼此。战斗很激烈，但最后太阳神打败了大蛇。当阿瓦梅林举起他的剑，准备进行致命一击时，瑟特鲁斯问了他一个简单的问题。\"当你的主人的玩物可以通过自己的意志获得同样的力量时，为什么要为你的主人服务？\" 阿瓦梅林当时就出手了，杀死了塞尔图斯。他带着obyrith的头颅回到了文明社会，作为他胜利的证明，并向全国的牧师们讲述了这个恶魔的愚蠢言论。",
	"Yet in spreading these words, Avamerin unwittingly released a great secret. Scholars and priests puzzled over Sertrous's dying words and made an incredible discovery: One need not worship a god to gain the power of divine magic. Rather than worship a god, a cleric could worship an ideal and gain the same reward. He could worship the mountains, or the sky, or the act of war, or himself. He could even worship a slain obyrith lord. Avamerin saw this plague of godless priests thrive and was powerless to stop it. The solar realized his error, and when he confessed to his lord, he was stripped of his rank and reduced to a planetar's status.": "然而，在传播这些话时，阿瓦梅林无意中泄露了一个巨大的秘密。学者和牧师们对塞尔特鲁斯的临终遗言进行了思索，并取得了一个令人难以置信的发现。一个人不需要崇拜一个神来获得神圣魔法的力量。与其说是崇拜一个神，不如说是崇拜一个理想，获得同样的回报。他可以崇拜山，或者天空，或者战争行为，或者他自己。他甚至可以崇拜被杀的obyrith领主。阿瓦梅林看到这种无神论者的瘟疫在蓬勃发展，却无力阻止它。太阳神意识到了自己的错误，当他向他的领主忏悔时，他被剥夺了他的等级，降为行星人的地位。",
	"Enraged, Avamerin cast aside his servitude and stole Sertrous's head, claiming that the dead demon was wiser than the gods. The gods recoiled and took from Avamerin his beauty. If he would ascribe such value to a serpent's words, he would be one with them. The gods gave him the visage of a snake and banished him from heaven. Yet the damage had been done. The angel became the first heretic, and he devoted the rest of his existence to serving the one who had opened his eyes. In time, the devotion of Avamerin and those he recruited to his Vanguard would be enough to restore Sertrous to life and prove what the fallen angel had come to believe was the truth beyond the lies of faith.": "阿瓦梅林被激怒了，抛弃了他的奴役，偷走了瑟特鲁斯的头，声称这个死去的恶魔比诸神更有智慧。诸神退避三舍，从阿瓦梅林手中夺走了他的美貌。如果他把这种价值归于一条蛇的话语，他就会与它们融为一体。诸神给了他一个蛇的面孔，并把他从天堂驱逐出去。然而伤害已经造成了。这位天使成了第一个异教徒，他把他的余生都献给了那个打开他眼睛的人。随着时间的推移，阿瓦梅林和那些被他招募到他的先锋队的人的奉献将足以让塞尔特鲁斯恢复生命，并证明这位堕落的天使所相信的是超越信仰谎言的真理。",
	"The Vanguard of Sertrous is an ancient organization of murderers and raiders that has risen and fallen over the millennia. Thousands of years ago, these nihilistic yuan-ti, whose priests taught that worship of the gods was unnecessary to gain divine power, surged from a trackless fen to lay siege to the surrounding nations. The Vanguard was defeated, but its teachings proved immortal. Every few hundred years, a new zealot takes up the cause and leads a new army on the march.": "塞特鲁斯的先锋队是一个由杀人犯和突击队员组成的古老组织，几千年来不断兴起和衰落。几千年前，这些虚无主义的元老们，他们的牧师教导说，为了获得神力，对神的崇拜是不必要的，他们从一个无迹可寻的沼泽地涌出，对周围的国家进行围攻。先锋队被打败了，但它的教义被证明是不朽的。每隔几百年，就会有新的狂热者加入这一事业，并带领一支新的军队前进。",
	"Although the armies through the years rose from different regions, they all shared similar tactics and compositions. Without variation, the Vanguard is led by yuan-ti but filled with enslaved or dominated minions. When its numbers reach the right point, its leaders unleash hordes of transformed and corrupted slaves and minions in a wave of murder and mayhem.": "尽管这些年的军队从不同地区崛起，但他们都有类似的战术和组成。先锋军由元老领导，但充满了被奴役或被支配的奴才，没有任何变化。当其人数达到适当的程度时，其领导人就会释放出成群的被改造和腐蚀的奴隶和奴才，进行一波又一波的谋杀和混乱。",
	"Although the leaders of the Vanguard claim to follow the teachings of an obscure demon lord named Sertrous, the Prince of Heretics has remained dead since he was defeated long ago. The rank-and-file soldier in the Vanguard does not know this. The teachings of Sertrous come to the leaders through the decapitated head of their demonic patron, preserved in a secret reliquary.": "虽然先锋军的领导人声称遵循一位名叫塞特鲁斯（Sertrous）的不知名的恶魔领主的教诲，但异端王子自从很久以前被打败后就一直死了。先锋军中的普通士兵并不知道这一点。塞特鲁斯的教义是通过保存在一个秘密灵堂里的他们的恶魔守护者的头颅传给领导人的。",
	"The first Vanguard army was led by Sertrous himself, who marched upon his neighbors in a rage fueled by jealousy. He coveted their cities, their accomplishments, and most of all the adoration the citizens heaped upon the gods. Sertrous wanted to be worshiped and held in awe, and the only way he could accomplish this was through conquest. He was slain by the angel Avamerin, who, it is rumored, later fell victim to the Vanguard and was himself slain.": "第一支先锋军是由塞尔图斯本人领导的，他在嫉妒的驱使下向他的邻居们进军。他觊觎他们的城市，他们的成就，以及最重要的是公民对神灵的崇拜。塞特鲁斯希望被崇拜和敬畏，而他能实现这一目标的唯一途径就是征服。他被天使阿瓦梅林所杀，据传他后来成为先锋军的受害者，自己也被杀了。",
	"Sertrous's true reasons for waging war on the Material Plane are more than mere jealousy. He wishes to return to the Abyss and reclaim his realm now that the time of the Queen of Chaos is past. Although he is dead, his spirit persists both in his severed head and in the rebellious will of Avamerin, who serves as the leader of the Vanguard in Sertrous's absence. With each war, the souls of those who die in the Vanguard's service are drawn into the Abyss to await their master's return, while at the same time the armies and resources of his Material Plane enemies are depleted. When his army of slithering petitioners in the Abyss is great enough, he shall return to life and reclaim his throne as a demon lord.": "瑟楚斯在物质界发动战争的真正原因不仅仅是嫉妒。他希望回到深渊，夺回他的领域，因为混沌女王的时代已经过去。虽然他已经死了，但他的精神在他被砍下的头颅和阿瓦梅林的叛逆意志中持续存在，阿瓦梅林在塞尔图斯不在时担任先锋军的领袖。每一次战争，那些为先锋军服务的人的灵魂都被卷入深渊，等待他们主人的归来，同时，他的物质世界的敌人的军队和资源也被耗尽了。当他在深渊中的滑行请愿者大军足够强大时，他将回到生活中，重新获得他作为恶魔领主的王位。",
	"Avamerin remains hidden, a shadow leader of the Vanguard. When one army is defeated, he waits for a few centuries to start again, choosing a new champion to woo followers away from the yuan-ti gods and to lead an army against the world. As a result, the latest Vanguard can come from anywhere in the campaign world where the yuan-ti are active. The Serpent Reliquary itself, where Avamerin dwells and Sertrous's head is kept, exists in its own dimension accessed by a portal placed in a remote location in the campaign world.": "阿瓦梅林一直隐藏着，是先锋军的影子领袖。当一支军队被打败后，他等待几个世纪后再开始，选择一个新的冠军来招揽元神的追随者，并带领一支军队对抗世界。因此，最新的先锋军可以来自战役世界中元神活跃的任何地方。阿瓦梅林居住的蛇神遗迹和蛇神的头颅被保存在它自己的维度中，通过放置在战役世界中的一个偏远地点的传送门进入。",
	"The earth vomits torrents of snakes and serpentine creatures. At first these infestations consist of normal snakes, but as the infestation grows, monstrous creatures such as chaotic evil nagas, hydras, and even mariliths become more common. As the sign grows more potent, the infesting serpents become increasingly more deformed. Some might have multiple heads, others are inside out, and some might have no head or tail—they're simply a mass of coils with no end or beginning.": "大地吐出大量的蛇和蛇形生物。起初，这些侵扰是由正常的蛇组成的，但随着侵扰的增长，诸如混乱的邪恶纳迦、水蛇，甚至是玛丽莉丝等畸形生物变得更加普遍。随着迹象越来越强烈，侵扰的蛇变得越来越畸形。有的可能有多个头，有的从里到外，有的可能没有头或尾，它们只是一团没有尽头或开始的线圈。",

	"{@b Faint:} The ecosystem is disrupted as snakes and other serpentine creatures begin to corrupt the environment. Bodies of water become tainted and sometimes poisonous. The food chain is toppled as both predator and prey alike are hunted by large swarms of snakes that consume all in their path. Farmers soon find their crops and livestock to be eviscerated by these snakes, disrupting trade and causing famine and disease as conditions worsen.": "{@b Faint:} 生态系统被破坏，因为蛇和其他蛇类生物开始腐蚀环境。水体变得污浊，有时甚至有毒。食物链被颠覆，因为捕食者和猎物都被大群的蛇所捕杀，它们吞噬了所有的食物。农民很快发现他们的庄稼和牲畜被这些蛇吃掉了，随着情况的恶化，贸易受到干扰，造成饥荒和疾病。",
	"{@b Moderate:} The ecosystem continues to be corrupted by large numbers of powerful serpents. In untamed areas of the wilderness, the environment is completely warped into a sickened, Abyss-like haven of chaos and destruction. Often times, these untamed areas have some sort of apex predator that the rest of the serpents fear and/or follow. Some of these predators are impossibly large yet instinctual serpents such as a hydra or golothoma, and others are intelligent rulers such as demons and nagas that command legions of snakes to do their bidding.": "{@b Moderate:} 生态系统继续被大量强大的蛇类所腐蚀。在荒野的未开发区域，环境被完全扭曲成一个病态的、类似深渊的混乱和破坏的天堂。通常情况下，这些未被驯服的地区有某种顶级掠食者，其余的蛇类都害怕和/或追随。这些掠食者中有些是不可能的大蛇，但却有本能，如九头蛇或戈洛托马，其他的则是智能统治者，如恶魔和纳加斯，它们指挥蛇群听命于它们。",
	"{@b Strong:} The infestation rapidly explodes outwards from infested areas, enroaching on all but the most urban areas of the world. The colossal, apex serpents that were once rare bosses become common leaders, often leading swarms of serpents during assaults on civilization. Infected areas become almost completely identical to the wastes of the Abyss, and are unlivable for any non-serpentine creature. Portals may open up in the deep recesses of the wilderness, but instead of opening into the Abyss, thousands upon thousands of snakes pour into the surrounding area, ensuring that there is never a short supply of serpents in the world.": "{@b Strong:} 蛇患迅速地从受影响的地区向外爆发，除了世界上的最多的城市地区外，其他地区都被蛇患侵袭。曾经是罕见的老大的巨大的顶级大蛇变成了常见的领袖，在攻击文明的过程中经常领导大蛇群。受感染的地区变得几乎与深渊的废物完全相同，任何非蛇类生物都无法生存。门户可能会在荒野的深处打开，但不是打开到深渊，而是成千上万的蛇涌入周围地区，确保世界上永远不会缺少蛇类的供应。",
	"{@b Overwhelming:} Civilization is overrun except for the most fortified of settlements.

	"{@b SPL 9 (Faint Sign):} Seghulerak seizes control of the ancient yuan-ti temple-city of Veshlivenk in a southern jungle and establishes a network of {@i serpentgates}, freestanding portals that allow the Vanguard of Sertrous to move between seven linked temples scattered throughout the world. One such temple is located in the large swamp beyond the priory. Serpents and snakes grow more common, and the party is hired to find out what's causing so many snakes to slither out of the swamp.

	"The teachings of Sertrous have a subtle effect in Eberron, since the deities of this world are much less invested in the workings of their followers.

Built around an extradimensional cube trapped between the planes, the Reliquary was constructed by the fallen planetar Avamerin to serve as a place for him to rest between incursions and as a place to safely keep Sertrous's head secure from those who would attempt to destroy it.": "蛇之遗迹是先锋军在多元宇宙中存在的核心。它围绕着一个被困在各平面之间的超维立方体而建，是由堕落的星球人阿瓦梅林建造的，作为他在两次入侵之间休息的地方，同时也是一个安全地保护塞尔图斯的头颅不被那些试图摧毁它的人所破坏的地方。",
	"The layout of the rooms within the Serpent Reliquary disrupts most mapping attempts. This complex is constructed around a tesseract, a structure whose sides connect in ways that are unfathomable in a three-dimensional world.": "蛇形遗迹内的房间布局打乱了大多数绘图的尝试。这个建筑群是围绕着一个魔方建造的，这个结构的各面连接方式在三维世界中是无法理解的。",
	"The chambers within the complex are aligned to the different sides of the tesseract, producing seemingly impossible (at least, from a three-dimensional point of view) room connections within the complex. Arrows on the map show what other rooms can be reached from each area.": "建筑群内的房间与魔方的不同侧面对齐，在建筑群内产生了看似不可能的（至少，从三维角度来看）房间连接。地图上的箭头显示从每个区域可以到达哪些其他房间。",
	"Each of the complex's sections is located on its own demiplane, separate from but contained wholly by the complex itself. The ranges of all divinations cast within the complex are limited to the area where the spell is cast.": "该建筑群的每个部分都位于自己的半位面，与建筑群本身分开，但完全被建筑群所包含。在建筑群内施展的所有占卜的范围都被限制在施法的区域内。",
	"Although the walls inside of each complex are made of magically enhanced stone, they are still subject to effects and damage as normal. Where faces of the tesseract touch, door-shaped portals allow movement between them. Passage through these portals feels no different from moving through a doorway. Physical objects can pass with ease, and a creature in one area can observe events in an adjacent area by looking through an open portal.": "虽然每个建筑群内部的墙壁都是由经过魔法强化的石头制成的，但它们仍然会像普通人一样受到影响和损害。在魔方表面接触的地方，门形的传送门允许在它们之间移动。通过这些传送门的感觉与通过一个门洞没有什么不同。物理物体可以轻松通过，一个区域的生物可以通过打开的门户观察邻近区域的事件。",
	"Air within the complex constantly refreshes, and rooms are humid and warm": "建筑群内的空气不断刷新，房间内湿润而温暖",
	"The following locations correspond to those indicated on the Reliquary map.": "以下地点与遗迹地图上标明的地点相对应。",
	"No matter how one travels to the Serpent Reliquary, the traveler finds himself stepping through a portal and emerging into this grandly appointed hall. The polished floor bears the symbol of Sertrous (a coiled but headless snake wrapped around and through a snake's skull), as do the immense tapestries and banners that hang from the hall's 100-foot-high ceiling.": "无论人们以何种方式前往蛇神庙，旅行者都会发现自己穿过了一个门户，出现在这个布置宏伟的大厅。抛光的地板上有塞特鲁斯的标志（一条盘绕但无头的蛇，缠绕并穿过蛇的头骨），大厅100英尺高的天花板上悬挂着巨大的挂毯和旗帜。",
	"The approach to the double doors that lead to area B is warded by divination magic. As soon as a creature of any alignment other than chaotic evil enters this area, the snake statues scattered throughout areas B through G begin hissing loudly in alarm, alerting the entire Reliquary to the presence of intruders.": "通往B区的双门是由占卜魔法守护着的。一旦有混沌邪恶以外的生物进入这个区域，散布在B区到G区的蛇形雕像就会开始大声地嘶鸣报警，提醒整个灵堂有入侵者。"
