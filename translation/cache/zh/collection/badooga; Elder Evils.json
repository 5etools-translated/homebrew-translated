Unaware that the draudnus slew their employer, the babaus snuck into the church, leaving their tracks about the grounds. The draudnus soon followed and assaulted the church directly, one of their number falling in a pitched battle that took the lives of a large number of clerics and monks.

	"Having no need for sustenance doesn't stop these dim creatures from hunting. Black cysts seem to take special delight from dissolving the flesh of their victims, and when they kill a mortal, they set to work liquefying the victim with their unspeakable essences in a process that can take hours.

	"Cursing with every step, begging his feet to turn around so he might save his friends, his body denied him for the fear had a grip on his heart and there was no turning back. So he ran.

The sounds of his pursuers were close. Too close.": "他每走一步都在咒骂，求他的脚转过来，这样他就可以救他的朋友，但他的身体拒绝了他，因为恐惧已经控制了他的心，没有回头路了。于是他跑了起来。他跑了几分钟，但感觉像是几天，在恐慌中，他失去了对自己位置的追踪，在荒凉的走廊和被诅咒的矿井生锈的栏杆中失去了自我。当他的呼吸变得急促，身边的疼痛迫使他停下来时，他倒下了，泪水从他的眼睛里涌出，小小的啜泣声从他干裂的嘴唇里逸出。他知道自己必死无疑。追兵的声音很近。太近了。",

	"Fleeing through the tunnels, he eventually became lost and stumbled into a chamber containing a great abomination, a fragment of Tharizdun's personality severed at the time of his imprisonment. Giorge's sudden arrival and the approach of more fishfolk hunters caused the great horror to awaken and snatch Giorge, plunging the mortal into the thickened waters contaminated by its rot. Beneath the churning surface, the entity known as Shothragot infested Giorge's mind, rent his spirit, and seized his body, transforming it into something else entirely.": "在隧道中逃亡，他最终迷失了方向，偶然进入了一个装有巨大憎恶的房间，那是塔里兹敦在被囚禁时被切断的人格碎片。乔吉的突然到来和更多的鱼人猎人的接近使巨大的恐怖苏醒并抓住了乔吉，使这个凡人陷入了被它的腐烂所污染的浓水之中。在汹涌的水面下，被称为Shothragot的实体侵袭了Giorge的思想，撕裂了他的精神，并抓住了他的身体，将其完全转化为另一种东西。",
	"The elder evil awakened a trace of fiendish blood that lay dormant in the broken ranger, causing him to become a tiefling. The severe agony of transformation shattered Giorge's mind, and when he was spit out upon the shores, he gibbered like an idiot, shrieking and laughing by turns for days on end. But the thing in the pool was not through with its first disciple.": "长老的邪恶唤醒了沉睡在这个残破游侠体内的一丝恶魔之血，使他变成了一个铁弗林。变身的剧烈痛苦击碎了乔吉的心灵，当他被吐在岸边时，他像个白痴一样叽叽喳喳地叫着，连续几天轮流尖叫和大笑。但池中的东西并没有完成它的第一个弟子。",
	"Shothragot swelled out from the pool's depths and instructed Giorge to go forth to spread the news of its coming, and also to find and destroy its enemies. The new champion had no choice but to agree since Shothragot possessed his soul. And so he went out into the world, scouring the lands through which he traveled for those he perceived as threats and for those marked by his god as being chosen to die. When he finds them, he does as he has been commanded. He kills.": "Shothragot从池子的深处膨胀出来，并指示Giorge前去传播它到来的消息，同时也要找到并消灭它的敌人。新冠军别无选择，只能同意，因为肖特拉戈特拥有他的灵魂。于是他走向世界，在他所经过的土地上搜寻那些他认为是威胁的人，以及那些被他的神标记为被选中的人。当他找到他们时，他就按照他的命令行事。他杀了人。",
	"The experience in the Crater Ridge Mines left Giorge Forsworn changed in body and mind. The physical changes, while profound, compared little to the evil filling the vessel of his soul. The entity in the shadowy cave filled his mind with disturbing visions of apocalypse and planted instructions that grew and thrived in the haunted corridors of his thoughts. Now when he draws close to an individual Shothragot deems a threat—no matter how minor—Giorge sees a fiery glyph burning on her brow. This sigil marks those Giorge must kill even though each murder pained him, reducing him to tears for he knew in his heart that what he did was wrong. But Giorge serves because nothing else is permitted to him—nothing beyond furthering his master's ambitions, and no doubt—no hesitation—will ever stop him from fulfilling his profane duty.": "在火山口岭矿区的经历使乔吉-福斯沃恩的身体和心灵都发生了变化。身体上的变化虽然很深刻，但与充斥在他灵魂容器中的邪恶相比，却显得微不足道。阴暗洞穴中的实体在他的脑海中充满了令人不安的天启幻象，并种下了指令，这些指令在他思想的鬼魂走廊中成长和茁壮。现在，当他接近一个被Shothragot视为威胁的人时--无论多么微小--乔治看到她的眉毛上燃烧着一个火红的石刻。这个符号标志着Giorge必须杀死的人，尽管每一次谋杀都让他感到痛苦，让他流泪，因为他心里知道他的所作所为是错误的。但乔尔格服役的原因是，除了促进他主人的野心之外，他没有别的选择，没有任何怀疑--没有任何犹豫--会阻止他履行他的神圣职责。",
	"Giorge Forsworn is insane. He is a villain in his own right, but he is also a servant of an elder evil. Shothragot has a penchant for remaking mortals into useful servants, bending their bodies and minds to become fitting tools for use in its own agenda of freeing Tharizdun. Giorge, then, is an extension of the elder evil's will. He travels endlessly, moving through the lands, always watching and searching for those marked for death. He is a reluctant servant, haunted by the memories of his life before the touch of evil, and he despairs about his fate. Even the company of a {@creature Mask|EdE|beautiful nymph} is not enough to drag him from his melancholic thoughts, though she uses every trick she can to distract him from his suffering.": "乔吉-福斯沃恩是个疯子。他本身就是一个恶棍，但他也是一个长老级恶魔的仆人。Shothragot喜欢把凡人改造成有用的仆人，把他们的身体和思想改造成合适的工具，用于自己解放塔里兹敦的计划。因此，乔吉是长老邪恶意志的延伸。他无休止地旅行，在这片土地上移动，一直在观察和寻找那些被标记为死亡的人。他是一个不情愿的仆人，被他在接触邪恶之前的生活记忆所困扰，他对自己的命运感到绝望。即使有一个{@creature Mask|EdE|beautiful nymph}的陪伴，也不足以把他从忧郁的思绪中拖出来，尽管她用尽一切办法让他从痛苦中转移注意力。",
	"Regardless of his detestation for his work, he cannot stop himself. He must do as his master commands and he has no concept of sparing his victims. Therefore, in spite of his reluctance, Giorge is a foul adversary that strikes seemingly at random. In one village, he might slaughter an entire family of peasants, and in the next, he may burn down a temple of St. Cuthbert. Even he has no idea why his targets are selected. He only knows that they are.": "无论他对自己的工作有多厌恶，他都无法阻止自己。他必须按照主人的命令行事，他没有放过受害者的概念。因此，尽管他很不情愿，但乔尔格是一个可怕的对手，他似乎是随意出手的。在一个村子里，他可能会屠杀一整个农民家庭，而在下一个村子里，他可能会烧毁一座圣卡斯特伯特庙。甚至他也不知道为什么他的目标被选中。他只知道他们是。",
	"Giorge Forsworn discovered Shothragot imprisoned deep within the Undermountain. Much of his murders are confined to the city of Waterdeep above the elder evil, but Giorge has blood from all across the Sword Coast on his hands.": "乔吉-福斯沃恩发现肖特拉戈特被囚禁在地下山的深处。他的大部分谋杀案都被限制在水底城的长老邪恶之上，但乔吉的手上沾满了整个剑海岸的血。",

	"Dorn doesn't want to serve Zargon, but his master has commanded it. He must do as he was bidden, so he returned to the Lost City and the madness of his people. Soon after arriving, he met Vanessa, who convinced him to slay his father and take command of the cult. With the filthy deed done, Dorn is even more insane and secretly murders his people to quell the rage growing within him. Given the chance, Dorn would slay Zargon himself, but he knows such thoughts are mad.": "多恩并不想为扎贡服务，但他的主人已经命令他这样做。他必须听从命令，所以他回到了失落之城和他的人民的疯狂中。到达后不久，他遇到了瓦妮莎，她说服他杀死他的父亲并指挥邪教。肮脏的事做完后，多恩更加疯狂，他秘密地谋杀了他的人民，以平息他内心的愤怒。如果有机会，多恩会亲自杀了扎贡，但他知道这种想法是疯狂的。",

	"The majority of avolakias have taken to worshiping Kyuss, a little-known quasi-deity.

	"So eager are the avolakias to elevate Kyuss to full deity status that they actively recruit new worshipers for his cult. The creatures typically establish settlements beneath the communities of surface races, then use their Shapechanger and {@spell suggestion} abilities to infiltrate their target areas. Often a group of avolakias infiltrates a local religious institution and attempts to assume control of the funerary rites for the community. Should the avolakias succeed, they have access to plenty of corpses that they can use to create more undead. In addition, the disguised avolakias are in a perfect position to corrupt selected members of the community and slowly indoctrinate them into the {@cult Kyuss the Worm That Walks|EdE|cult of Kyuss}.": "阿沃拉基亚人如此渴望将凯斯提升到完全的神灵地位，以至于他们积极为他的崇拜者招募新的崇拜者。这些生物通常在地表种族的社区下面建立定居点，然后利用他们的变形术和（%0%）能力渗透到他们的目标区域。通常情况下，一群阿沃拉基亚人潜入当地的宗教机构，并试图控制该社区的葬礼仪式。如果阿沃拉基亚人成功了，他们就可以获得大量的尸体，用来制造更多的亡灵。此外，经过伪装的阿沃拉基亚人处于一个完美的位置，可以腐蚀社区中选定的成员，并慢慢地将他们灌输到（1%）。",
	"Avolakias also interact with various Underdark races. Some, such as the drow, they infiltrate in much the same way as they do surface races. With others, such as mind flayers, they openly propose alliances for the two groups' mutual benefit. A typical agreement between mind flayers and avolakias stipulates that both groups hunt down and capture intelligent beings. The mind flayers consume the unfortunate victims' brains, then hand the bodies over to the avolakias, who use them to create undead. But such alliances tend to fall apart eventually, either when the mind flayers enslave captives for long periods before consuming their brains, or when the avolakias kill a few mind flayers to make more powerful undead creatures.": "阿沃拉基亚人还与各种暗黑种族互动。有些种族，比如乌鸦，他们的渗透方式与他们对地面种族的渗透方式基本相同。对于其他的种族，比如说噬心者，他们公开提议结盟，以实现两个群体的共同利益。噬心者和阿沃拉基亚之间的一个典型协议规定，两个群体都要追捕和捕获智能生物。噬心者吞噬不幸的受害者的大脑，然后将尸体交给阿沃拉基亚人，后者用它们来创造亡灵。但这样的联盟最终往往会分崩离析，要么是在噬心者长期奴役俘虏，然后再吞噬他们的大脑，要么是阿沃拉基亚人杀死一些噬心者以制造更强大的不死生物。",

In a state of semiwakefulness, however, the Leviathan is susceptible to at least partial control, and its enormous destructive powers can be channeled against specific targets. Axihuatl intends to turn it against the surface-dwellers and their hated continents, leaving the world under miles of water where the ixitxachitl can rule unopposed.

	"A corrupture instinctively moves toward any moving object or creature larger than Tiny size and attacks it, trampling others in its rush to dissolve and taste flesh. Stubborn in its mindless hunger, a corrupture doggedly continues attacking the creature it first tastes. It uses its acid burst whenever its prey and at least one other creature are within range, or if it is blocked by a creature larger than it can trample. If a group of foes flee a corrupture, it follows only its prey, following the nearest creature if it has not yet tasted flesh. Once its initial prey dies, the corrupture attacks the largest fleshly creature of which it is aware; if no others are nearby, the ooze begins consuming its meal at leisure.": "腐化者本能地走向任何移动的物体或大于Tiny大小的生物，并攻击它，在急于溶解和品尝肉体的过程中践踏其他人。腐化者顽固地保持着无意识的饥饿感，顽强地继续攻击它第一次品尝的生物。只要它的猎物和至少一个其他生物在范围内，或者它被一个比它能践踏的更大的生物所阻挡，它就会使用它的酸液爆裂。如果一群敌人逃离腐化者，它只跟随它的猎物，如果它还没有尝到肉的味道，就跟随最近的生物。一旦最初的猎物死亡，腐烂者就会攻击它所知道的最大的肉体生物；如果附近没有其他生物，腐烂者就会开始悠闲地吞噬它的食物。",
	"A corrupture ignores creatures it cannot taste after its first attack, such as those not susceptible to its acid or those lacking flesh—at least until they move out of the range of its blindsight. (The mindless ooze cannot recognize a new moving object as one that it hit before.) Creatures immune to acid can escape harm simply by not attacking back after first being struck. The oozes seem to instinctively recognize that other corruptures aren't prey.": "腐化物在第一次攻击后会忽略它无法品尝的生物，比如那些不受其酸液影响的生物或缺乏肉体的生物--至少在它们移出它的盲视范围之前。(无意识敖包无法识别一个新的移动物体是它之前击中的物体）。对酸液免疫的生物只需在第一次被击中后不回击，就能逃脱伤害。渗水虫似乎能本能地识别出其他腐化物不是猎物。",

	"Corruptures come into being wherever the wilderness has been horribly befouled or natural laws have been repeatedly broken. In such places, nature reacts with a rent in existence that births a corrupture before closing, an embodiment of the cancerous damage to the world. Corruptures commonly appear in wilderness areas that have been poisoned or diseased, or that are heavily influenced by magic or another plane. Rarely they appear in civilized areas. Mundane defilement, such as razing a forest or draining a swamp, isn't enough to create a corrupture, but an arcane laboratory used for magical experimentation on creatures might well do so.": "在荒野被可怕地破坏或自然法则被反复破坏的地方，腐败就会出现。在这样的地方，自然界的反应是存在一个裂缝，在关闭之前诞生一个腐化物，是对世界的癌症损害的体现。腐败通常出现在被毒害或病变的荒野地区，或者受到魔法或另一个世界严重影响的地方。它们很少出现在文明地区。世俗的玷污，例如夷平一片森林或排干一片沼泽，并不足以产生腐化，但用于对生物进行魔法实验的奥术实验室很可能会这样做。",
	"A corrupture is a mindless hunter, driven by instinct to hunt down the nearest prey of fair size. It draws food and water directly through its skin, first dissolving flesh with its acid and then moving over the gooey remains.

They can feed on carrion if necessary, but they prefer fresh, fluid-filled prey.": "腐蚀者是一个无意识的猎手，在本能的驱使下，猎杀最近的大小猎物。它直接通过皮肤吸取食物和水，首先用它的酸液溶解肉体，然后在粘稠的残骸上移动。腐尸能够在短时间内靠植物物质生存，但至少每周需要一次肉。如果有必要，它们可以以腐肉为食，但它们更喜欢新鲜、充满液体的猎物。",
	"Corruptures have no gender and do not mate: They just get bigger. An undamaged corrupture with plenty to eat molts its outer flesh as it grows. This process takes a month of uninterrupted hibernation. After this time, the corrupture has an even more voracious appetite for several weeks. Larger, ancient corruptures begin to lose the ability to move under their own power. Such massive sacks of flesh can actually become stationary and starve.": "腐败分子没有性别，也不交配。它们只是变得更大。一个未受损害的腐化动物，如果有充足的食物，就会在成长过程中蜕去其外皮的肉。这个过程需要一个月的不间断的冬眠。在这段时间之后，腐蚀者在几个星期内会有更加贪婪的胃口。较大的、古老的腐蚀体开始失去在其自身力量下移动的能力。这种巨大的肉袋实际上可以成为静止的和饥饿的。",
	"Corruptures can appear in any sullied environment, even the sea.": "腐败可以出现在任何被玷污的环境中，甚至是大海。",
	"A corrupture is a large mass of semifluid flesh approximately 15 feet in diameter. It constantly undulates and pulses, making its exact mass difficult to determine, but a typical example weighs about 6,000 pounds. Corruptures' flesh varies in color from tan to pink to angry red, and is covered in a web of veins, bruises, and sores. Boils of thick, yellow acid swell up on its surface every few seconds, bursting to spray the area. The skin of a corrupture is covered with the residue of these eruptions, coating it in a caustic slime.": "腐化物是一大块半流体的肉，直径约为15英尺。它不断地起伏和跳动，使其确切的质量难以确定，但一个典型的例子大约有6000磅重。腐败者的肉体颜色各不相同，从棕褐色到粉红色再到愤怒的红色，并覆盖着网状的血管、瘀伤和溃疡。浓稠的黄色酸液每隔几秒钟就会在其表面膨胀起来，爆裂开来喷洒在该地区。腐败者的皮肤上覆盖着这些喷发的残余物，涂上一层腐蚀性的粘液。",

By the time Kyuss vanished, most of his ulgurstastas had become at least as intelligent as ghouls. Knowing that they would be hunted down and destroyed by Kyuss's remaining enemies, the ulgurstastas retreated deep into the wilderness. Despite their attempt at self-preservation, most of them were hunted down and slain in the coming years, until only a handful survived deep in the Wormcrawl Fissure.

Their orders once drove them to convert living beings into skeletons, but as time wore on, this drive has been replaced by a need to become more intelligent.

It is not unlikely that in some forgotten corner of the Wormcrawl, there might lurk an ulgurstasta of genius level or higher; these ulgurstastas might even have mastered the school of Necromancy themselves.": "由于他们是通过强大的死灵魔法创造的，这些生物不能繁殖，也不需要呼吸或进食。他们的命令曾经驱使他们将活人转化为骷髅，但随着时间的推移，这种驱动力已经被变得更加智能的需求所取代。一般来说，由乌尔古斯塔斯塔创造的每一千具骷髅都能让它保留足够的思想和记忆，以获得一分智能。在虫爬的某个被遗忘的角落里，可能潜伏着一个天才级别或更高的ulgurstasta；这些ulgurstastas甚至可能自己掌握了Necromancy的学问，这也不是不可能的。",
	"Ulgurstastas have grown much more intelligent over the centuries and behave accordingly. An ulgurstasta attacks with its jaws. These jaws are mounted on a flexible stalk and have a reach of 15 feet.": "几个世纪以来，Ulgurstastas已经变得更加聪明，并有相应的行为。Ulgurstasta用它的下颚进行攻击。这些下巴安装在一个灵活的柄上，有15英尺的距离。",
	"This creature's hairless, overlarge head surmounts its wet, wrinkled, and bloated humanoid body. Its eyes are glassy and vacant. Its arms are too slender, and its tiny hands end in cruelly sharpened nails, while its legs are atrophied, dead things that hang useless below it.": "这种生物没有毛发，巨大的头顶着湿漉漉的、有皱纹的、臃肿的人形身体。它的眼睛是玻璃状的、空洞的。它的手臂过于纤细，小手的末端是残忍的尖锐的指甲，而它的腿是萎缩的死物，挂在下面没有用。",
	"Atropal scions are clots of divine flesh given form and animation by bleak-hearted gods of death. When a stillborn godling rises spontaneously as an undead, an atropal is born. If that atropal is defeated, but any fragment or cast-off bit of flesh remains, an atropal scion may yet arise from those fragments, lessened in power from its divine beginnings, but no less hateful for its stature.": "阿托帕尔子孙是由心境凄凉的死亡之神赋予形态和活力的神肉块。当一个死产的神灵自发地上升为亡灵，一个阿托帕尔就诞生了。如果阿托帕尔被打败了，但任何碎片或被抛弃的肉体仍然存在，一个阿托帕尔的子孙可能会从这些碎片中产生，它的力量比它的神性开始时要小，但它的地位并不逊于它的仇恨。",
	"Unlike normal {@creature atropal|ToA|atropals}, atropal scions are imbued with foul magic that grants them a smidgen of spellcasting. Given enough time, an atropal scion may evolve into a threat much greater than the undead it originally splintered off of.": "与普通的（%0%）不同，阿托帕尔的后裔被灌输了污秽的魔法，赋予他们一丁点的法术能力。如果有足够的时间，阿托帕尔后裔可能会演化成比它最初分裂出来的亡灵更大的威胁。",

It directs its innate spells and abilities upon those foes its mere presence cannot kill.": "一种令人灵魂麻木的寒冷在一个萎缩的子孙面前和之后出现。英雄生物的生命能量被压制在它肮脏的光环中，而较弱的生物的生命力则被熄灭。它将其天生的法术和能力用于那些它的存在无法杀死的敌人。",
	"Atropus is as much a place as it is a being. It is a small moonlet spinning through the void, waiting to be ensnared by the pull of the planets it nears. To those on the surface of the chosen world, the elder evil appears as a speck in the sky. At night it is almost invisible, blending in with the darkness, but during twilight and dawn, it looks like a moving pinhole of darkness.": "阿特罗普斯既是一个地方，也是一种存在。它是一个在虚空中旋转的小月球，等待着被它所接近的行星的拉力所捕获。对于那些在被选中的世界表面的人来说，这个邪恶的老人就像天空中的一个斑点。在晚上，它几乎看不见，与黑暗融为一体，但在黄昏和黎明时分，它看起来像一个移动的黑暗针孔。",
	"As it draws closer and its sign intensifies, it grows, expanding from a tiny dot to a small disk until it dominates the sky. Pitted and slick with the black slime of the putrid amniotic fluid of its birth, it hangs above, always drifting away from the light of the sun and lurking overhead when the sun has fled. It has the appearance of a huge chunk of black stone, but from certain angles, it looks like a great hairless head, black eyes glassy and soulless.": "随着它的距离越来越近，它的标志也越来越强烈，从一个小点扩大到一个小圆盘，直到它主宰了整个天空。坑坑洼洼、滑溜溜的黑色粘液是它出生时的腐烂羊水，它悬挂在上面，总是远离太阳的光芒，当太阳逃走时，它就潜伏在头顶上。它的外表是一块巨大的黑石头，但从某些角度看，它又像一个巨大的无毛头，黑色的眼睛是玻璃状的，没有灵魂。",
	"Atropus has no understandable personality and no inclinations other than craving the destruction of all living things. This rock is not uninhabited: Undead conjured from the darkest nightmares infest it. These horrors claim the craters for themselves, flitting through the shadows, ravenous for the energy of the living. The master of them all is the focus, an extension of Atropus's will.": "阿特罗普斯没有可以理解的个性，除了渴望毁灭所有生物之外，没有其他倾向。这块岩石并非无人居住。从最黑暗的噩梦中召唤出来的亡灵在这里出没。这些恐怖的东西将火山口据为己有，在阴影中飞来飞去，贪婪地汲取活人的能量。它们的主人是焦点，是阿特罗普斯意志的延伸。",
	"The focus is a headless, human-shaped creature with flesh fossilized during Atropus's endless roaming through the cosmos. Closer inspection reveals that its foul body shares the same hideous coating that wells up from the rents and fissures on the moonlet's surface.": "焦点是一个无头的人形生物，其肉体在阿特罗普斯无休止地在宇宙中漫游时被化石化。仔细观察会发现，它那肮脏的身体与小月球表面的裂缝中涌出的可怕涂层相同。",

	"Stalking the wastelands in preparation for Father Llymic's awakening, the brood mirror their creator's twisted form. Birthed from the bodies of unsuspecting creatures, the brood are pale mockeries of their former selves, recast in plates of frozen crystal with vicious claws and sharp-edged teeth.": "在荒原上徘徊，为Llymic神父的觉醒做准备，兄弟们反映了他们创造者的扭曲形态。从毫无戒心的生物的身体中孕育出来的肉身，是他们以前的苍白的嘲弄，在冰冻的水晶板中重铸，有着凶恶的爪子和锋利的牙齿。",
	"The brood remember nothing of their former lives and seek only to carry out Father Llymic's will. They prowl the area around his frozen form, subduing intruders and native creatures and taking them to be transformed. If a threat to Father Llymic surfaces, the brood take any means necessary to drive off or destroy the enemy.": "这些孩子对他们以前的生活毫无印象，只想执行父亲Llymic的意志。他们在他的冰冻形态周围徘徊，制服入侵者和本地生物，并带他们去接受改造。如果对Llymic神父的威胁浮出水面，他们会采取任何必要的手段来赶走或消灭敌人。",
	"The brood are the primary adversaries the party faces when dealing with Father Llymic. Although initial encounters might involve crazed cultists who venerate the alien creature, these soon succumb to Father Llymic's will and become the first brood. At first the brood consist of nothing more than vague rumors and lone sightings, but as Father Llymic's strength grows, they become an overwhelming threat, marching out from their icy home to spread their plague. As the end draws near, the brood are everywhere, having transformed every creature near Father Llymic's icy prison.": "雏鸟是党在对付Llymic神父时面临的主要对手。虽然最初遇到的可能是崇拜外星生物的疯狂崇拜者，但这些人很快就会屈服于Llymic神父的意志，成为第一批雏形。起初，这群人只是一些模糊的传言和单独的目击者，但随着Llymic神父力量的增长，他们成为一种压倒性的威胁，从他们冰冷的家出发，传播他们的瘟疫。随着末日的临近，这些虫子无处不在，它们改造了Llymic神父冰冷监狱附近的每一个生物。",
	"Retaining only a vague resemblance to the creatures that spawned them, the brood are terrible to behold. Made entirely of pale blue crystal, brood spawn are covered in sharp spikes and ridged plates. These protrusions grind against one another but never dull. When a brood spawn is wounded, a pale ichor flows out of the wounds, quickly hardening into a seal. Strange organs pulsate and strain inside them, and no two share the same physiology, even if they originated from the same type of creature. All have three perfectly round eyes atop their head, above a cavernous maw. These eyes allow them to see in any conditions of illumination.": "虫卵与产生它们的生物只有模糊的相似之处，它们是可怕的。完全由淡蓝色的水晶制成，雏形的卵子覆盖着锋利的尖刺和脊板。这些突起物相互磨擦，但从不迟钝。当一个卵巢受伤时，一种苍白的汁液会从伤口处流出，很快就会硬化成一个封印。陌生的器官在它们体内跳动和紧张，没有两个人的生理结构是相同的，即使它们源自同一类型的生物。它们的头顶上都有三只完美的圆眼，在一个空洞的大嘴之上。这些眼睛使它们能够在任何照明条件下看到东西。",
	"Mentally, all brood spawn are extensions of Father Llymic's thoughts. They carry out his desires without any need for communication. The spawn go about their business with cold precision, completely uncaring of those in their path. The brood have only two goals: to protect Father Llymic and to expand the brood.": "在精神上，所有的雏鸟都是父亲Llymic思想的延伸。他们执行他的愿望，不需要任何交流。卵子们冷酷无情地做着自己的事情，完全不关心那些在他们路上的人。卵子们只有两个目标：保护父亲Llymic和扩大卵子。",
	"The deity {@deity Tiamat}, Creator of Evil Dragonkind, has long sought domination of the world for herself and her progeny. For eons she has struggled against Bahamut, the King of Good Dragons, in a conflict called the Dragonfall War, and most people believed that this battle would last for millennia to come.": "神灵（%0%），邪恶龙族的创造者，长期以来一直在为自己和她的后代寻求对世界的统治。长久以来，她一直在与善龙之王巴哈姆特斗争，这场冲突被称为降龙战争，大多数人认为这场战斗将持续数千年之久。",
	"Recently, however, Tiamat unveiled her latest and most terrifying tactic. She created diverse and numerous creatures with the blood of chromatic dragons and sent forth these spawn to spread destruction and evil. This incursion of evil dragonblood creatures threatens the balance of the war and, by extension, the world.": "然而，最近，提亚马特公布了她最新和最可怕的策略。她用色龙的血创造了多种多样的生物，并派出这些产卵来传播破坏和邪恶。这种邪恶的龙血生物的入侵威胁着战争的平衡，进而威胁着世界。",
	"To thwart her ambitions, Bahamut created the noble dragonborn, but the challenge of fighting evil dragonkind demands even more heroes than the Platinum Dragon can produce. Today, Tiamat has the upper hand. It might well fall to the player characters to prevent her spawn from permanently tipping the Dragonfall War in favor of evil.": "为了挫败她的野心，巴哈姆特创造了高贵的龙族，但与邪恶的龙族作战的挑战需要比白金龙所能产生的更多的英雄。今天，提亚马特占了上风。阻止她的卵子使降龙战争永久地倾向于邪恶，这很可能落在玩家角色身上。",
	"Every spawn of Tiamat has some vestige of the power of the Queen of Evil Dragons in its blood. Many, though, are born not directly to her but to individual evil dragons throughout the world. Whether chosen by Tiamat herself or only by fickle chance, some chromatic dragon eggs hatch into the spawn described in this section. Usually a single egg is so touched, but occasionally an entire clutch produces spawn of Tiamat (which might not even be all the same kind). A given spawn is born only to a dragon that matches its color, which combined with the word \"spawn,\" forms part of its name. Blackspawn raiders and blackspawn stalkers, for example, are born only to black dragons. Although spawn first began to appear within clutches of dragon eggs, most of them breed true and now are rapidly multiplying.": "每一个提亚马特的后代都在其血液中带有恶龙女王力量的某些痕迹。不过，许多人不是直接为她而生，而是为全世界的个别恶龙而生。不管是由提亚马特自己选择，还是仅凭善变的机会，一些色龙蛋会孵化成本节所述的产卵。通常情况下，一个蛋会被触动，但偶尔一整窝龙会产生提亚马特的卵子（甚至可能不是同一种类）。一个特定的卵只生在与其颜色相匹配的龙身上，这与 \"卵 \"字相结合，构成其名称的一部分。例如，黑龙突袭者和黑龙潜行者，只为黑龙所生。尽管卵子最初是在龙蛋群中出现的，但它们中的大多数都是真正的繁殖者，现在正在迅速繁殖中。",
	"Evil dragons recognize the birth of a spawn of Tiamat as a fortunate omen, a sign of their creator's favor. That said, spawn rarely remain with their parents for long. They mature much more quickly than true dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years. Spawn of Tiamat usually congregate with other creatures, whether in packs of their kind or with like-minded individuals of other races, particularly evil dragons. Reports have surfaced recently of hobgoblin clerics and warlords gathering spawn of Tiamat and other evil dragons for a great battle. Whether this is part of Tiamat's plan for the Dragonfall War or stems from the goblinoids' general antipathy toward other races is unknown.": "恶龙认为提亚马特的卵子的诞生是一个幸运的预兆，是它们的创造者青睐的标志。话虽如此，产卵者很少与他们的父母长期在一起。它们比真龙成熟得更快，只需几年就能成年。提亚马特的产卵通常与其他生物聚集在一起，无论是在它们的族群中还是与其他种族的志同道合者，特别是恶龙。最近有报道称，妖精教士和军阀将提亚马特和其他邪龙的卵子聚集在一起进行一场伟大的战斗。这是否是提亚马特的降龙战争计划的一部分，还是源于妖精们对其他种族的普遍反感，我们不得而知。",
	"Regardless of their place in the world, all spawn share an unswerving loyalty to Tiamat, which their would-be allies would do well to remember. The spawn of Tiamat also share her undying hatred of good dragonkind, and they look down upon nondragons of all sorts.": "无论他们在这个世界上的地位如何，所有的产卵者都对提亚马特有着坚定不移的忠诚，他们的盟友最好记住这一点。提亚马特的后代也与她一样，对善良的龙族有着不死的仇恨，他们看不起各种非龙族。",
	"Tiamat is not pleased with the attitude many of her children have adopted. She is proud of the role chromatic dragons played in defeating the fiends and the quori, but she feels that they now waste time worrying about the Prophecy instead of subjugating the world.": "提亚马特对她的许多孩子所采取的态度并不满意。她为半音阶龙在击败魔族和科里的过程中所发挥的作用感到骄傲，但她觉得他们现在把时间浪费在担心预言上而不是征服世界。",
	"Some chromatic dragons agree with her and have rededicated themselves to her cause. In addition, she has whispered promises of a return of the great Dhakaani Empire to certain hobgoblin warlords in Darguun. Using these contacts, Tiamat has been able to seed the world with her spawn, and they are ready for when the call to battle goes forth.": "一些色龙同意她的观点，并重新献身于她的事业。此外，她还向达尔古恩的某些妖精军阀低声许诺了伟大的达卡尼帝国的回归。利用这些联系，提亚马特已经能够在世界范围内播撒她的卵子，他们已经准备好迎接战斗的召唤。",
	"Chromatic dragons not allied with Tiamat see the spawn's arrival as a dire portent that must somehow be related to the Prophecy, but they are oblivious to the true danger. They continue to do that for which Tiamat condemns them: They wait and watch, hoping to learn the true nature of these new dragonblood through observation and reflection on the Prophecy.": "未与提亚马特结盟的色龙将卵子的到来视为一个可怕的预兆，这肯定与预言有关，但它们对真正的危险视而不见。他们继续做着被提亚马特谴责的事情。他们等待和观察，希望通过观察和反思预言来了解这些新龙血的真正性质。",

	"The church of Tiamat has since managed to spread spawn throughout the Old Empires and beyond. Many lurk in dark corners of the world, roaming swamps, jungles, and caverns as they hunt their prey and wait for the call to join Tiamat's army. Some have allied themselves with the Cult of the Dragon, though that group's goals never take precedence over serving the will of Tiamat..": "此后，提亚马特的教会设法在整个旧帝国和其他地区传播卵子。许多人潜伏在世界的黑暗角落里，在沼泽、丛林和洞穴中游荡，他们猎杀猎物，等待加入提亚马特军队的召唤。有些人已经与龙的崇拜结盟，尽管该组织的目标从未优先于服务提亚马特的意志。",

	"Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a fundamental principle, such as \"The guilty should be punished,\" \"Bargains should be kept,\" or \"Everyone dies eventually.\" When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using spells like {@spell geas} to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. If unable to cross an ocean any other way, inevitables have been known to walk into the waves, traversing the seabed to emerge on another continent months later.": "每种类型的 \"必然 \"都被设计用来寻找和惩罚一种特定的违法行为，追捕违反基本原则的人或团体，例如 \"有罪的人应该受到惩罚\"，\"应该遵守交易\"，或者 \"每个人最终都会死亡\"。当一个不可避免的人被创造出来时，它就会接受它的第一个任务，然后找到违法者并实施适当的惩罚。判决通常是死亡，尽管有些不可避免者坚持要求对被害方进行赔偿，并使用{@spell geas}等法术来确保遵守。从第一步开始，不可避免者就完全专注于其目标。它继续努力，不管这条线索有多冷，任务有多无望。如果无法以其他方式穿越海洋，不可避免者就会走进海浪，穿越海床，几个月后出现在另一块大陆上。",
	"Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming. Even the most effective inevitables are periodically recalled to Mechanus for reprogramming.": "Inevitables一心一意地追捕他们的猎物，但他们接到的命令是不要伤害无辜者。然而，他们的猎物的帮凶是公平的，这有时会在他们的程序中产生冲突。即使是最有效的不可避免者也会定期被召回到麦格纳斯进行重新编程。",
	"Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long. It's apparent to anyone who spends much time with one that an inevitable would sacrifice an ally to fulfill its purpose without a second thought.": "不可避免的人乐意牺牲自己来完成任务，但他们并不是自杀式的。面对即将到来的失败，他们很可能会撤退，并寻求一种扳回局面的方法。他们是坚定但有耐心的敌人。如果有助于完成他们的任务，他们会与其他人结盟，但他们很难长期保持盟友。任何与之相处时间较长的人都会发现，不可避免地会牺牲一个盟友来实现自己的目的，而不假思索。",
	"When an inevitable completes its task, it wanders the landscape and passively observes life around it. When it discerns another transgression of the principle it is dedicated to, it has a new mission. Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Those in the know who hear about a 12-foot-tall, golden-armored statue roaming the countryside might seek out the inevitable and present a case, hoping it will take on the alleged transgressor. The decision is based on the idiosyncrasies of the inevitable's programming, so there's no guarantee.": "当一个不可避免的人完成了它的任务，它就会在风景中徘徊，被动地观察周围的生活。当它发现另一个违反它所致力于的原则的行为时，它就有了新的任务。当它处于观察模式时，不可避免者往往会在人群中显眼，但它们似乎对人们的关注视而不见。那些知情者听说有一个12英尺高的金甲雕像在乡间游荡，可能会寻找不可避免者，并提出一个案例，希望它能对所谓的违法者采取行动。这个决定是基于不可避免的程序的特异性，所以没有任何保证。",

	"Based on the experience of myself and others when running certain monsters, I find that keeping track of auras (such as {@creature Gorguth|EdE}'s Aura of Annihilation and Death Gaze) is very tedious and easy to forget. This happens because such an aura typically takes when another creature starts (or ends) its turn within a certain range of the aura's origin.

	"The issue I face is two-fold: first, official monsters already work this way, so for me to go against it could potentially be confusing to DMs that are already used to it. Second, as auras are constantly emanating, it makes sense that they take effect on every creatures' turns; other solutions contradict this logic by allowing creatures to pass through them without necessarily being affected.": "我面临的问题有两个：首先，官方的怪物已经这样工作了，所以我违背了这一点，有可能会让已经习惯了它的管理员感到困惑。第二，由于光环是不断发出的，因此在每个生物的回合中生效是合理的；其他解决方案与这一逻辑相矛盾，它们允许生物穿过光环而不一定受到影响。",
	"With that in mind, I still present to you this variant: rather than having an aura affect creatures at the start of their turns, have them affect creatures at the start of the aura emanator's turn. This may require some reflavoring - for example, a Negative Energy Aura would be flavored as a periodic burst of negative energy coming from an {@creature atropal|ToA}, rather than being a constant sphere around the atropal. However, this solution can drastically speed up your game; not to mention, your game being bogged down is probably even more immersion breaking than an aura that is ran using this variant.": "考虑到这一点，我仍然向你们介绍这个变体：与其让光环在生物的回合开始时影响它们，不如让它们在光环发出者的回合开始时影响生物。这可能需要重新调味--例如，负能量光环将被调味为来自（%0%）的周期性负能量爆发，而不是围绕阿托帕尔的恒定球体。然而，这个解决方案可以大大加快你的游戏速度；更不用说，你的游戏陷入困境可能比使用这种变体运行的光环更容易破坏沉浸感。",

Buried in the deepest bowels of the Underdark, hidden in the farthest reaches of the multiverse, or lost in the gulfs between realities are terrible things that exist only to destroy or horribly remake creation. So mighty are these ancient beings that even the gods think twice about standing against them. Mortals who are aware of their existence viciously suppress that knowledge and destroy any who would serve such things. Even if an elder evil can be forced back to whence it came, its mere presence changes the world forever. In short, it is a campaign ender.": "当古老的邪恶在蠢蠢欲动时，世界在呻吟；当它们觉醒时，世界在哭泣。埋藏在暗黑世界的最深处，隐藏在多元宇宙的最远处，或者迷失在现实之间的沟壑中，这些可怕的东西只为毁灭或可怕地重塑创造而存在。这些古老的生命是如此强大，甚至连诸神都要三思而后行。意识到它们存在的凡人会恶毒地压制这种知识，并摧毁任何为这种东西服务的人。即使一个古老的恶魔可以被逼回它的来处，它的存在也会永远改变世界。简而言之，它是一个运动的终结者。",

	"{@b Chapter 9. The Worm that Walks:} This elder evil is the memory of a slain corporeal god. Its essence transferred itself to the worms and maggots that devoured the deity's corpse, forming a hideous but vaguely humanoid shape.

Gods create and attend their creations; elder evils unravel them.": "长者的邪恶潜伏在生存的边缘。他们一直存在，也将一直存在。虽然他们可以像半神一样强大，有时甚至更强大，但他们并不是神灵。他们对凡人不感兴趣，除了要把他们消灭掉。神明创造并关注他们的创造物；长老的邪恶则解开它们。",
	"The mere presence of an elder evil threatens reality. Such power is difficult to conceal. If the party hasn't heard even a whisper of the entity to date, why and how has it masked its presence? Uncovering this mystery can be as thrilling a challenge as the final confrontation itself.": "仅仅是一个长者邪恶的存在就会威胁到现实。这样的力量是难以掩盖的。如果到目前为止，党派还没有听到这个实体的哪怕是一个耳语，那么它为什么以及如何掩盖其存在？揭开这个谜团可能和最后的对抗本身一样是一个惊心动魄的挑战。",
	"The secrecy of an elder evil depends on your needs as the Dungeon Master. If you're starting a new campaign and plan to end it in a confrontation with a world-threatening entity, plant the seeds early and drop hints over time. If you've decided recently to bring things to a head, there's nothing wrong with suddenly revealing the elder evil.": "长老邪恶的保密性取决于你作为地下城主的需要。如果你正在开始一个新的战役，并计划在与一个威胁世界的实体的对抗中结束它，那么尽早埋下种子，并随着时间的推移留下暗示。如果你最近决定要把事情进行到底，那么突然透露出长老级的邪恶是没有问题的。",
	"When introducing these terrifying entities into an established campaign, use what you already have. Recurring villains or their minions work well when the party already has an inkling of the nemesis. For example, when the nefarious high priest of Nerull reveals that she is in fact an accomplice of the Worm that Walks (see Chapter 9), the revelation is as logical as it is horrifying. On the other hand, a major campaign villain might turn out to be the elder evil itself. Faceless, recurring villains hide their identities behind several masks; as the campaign develops, the party exposes (or believe they expose) their true enemy again and again until you're ready to reveal the ultimate truth.": "在将这些可怕的实体引入已建立的活动中时，要利用你已有的东西。当党派已经对克星有了一定的了解时，反复出现的恶棍或他们的爪牙就会很有效。例如，当邪恶的内鲁尔（Nerull）大祭司透露她实际上是行走的虫子（见第9章）的帮凶时，这个启示既符合逻辑又令人恐惧。另一方面，一个主要的活动反派可能会被证明是长者的邪恶。无脸的、反复出现的反派人物把他们的身份隐藏在几个面具后面；随着战役的发展，党派一次又一次地暴露（或相信他们暴露了）他们真正的敌人，直到你准备揭示最终的真相。",
	"Each of the chapters of the original book describes an elder evil, its motivations and servants, and signs of its approach, as well as providing a sample story arc to help you introduce the threat into your campaign. A given entry uses the format below.": "原书的每一章都描述了一个长老的邪恶，它的动机和仆人，以及它接近的迹象，同时还提供了一个故事弧的样本，以帮助你将威胁引入你的战役中。一个特定的条目使用以下格式。",
	"This section opens with a paragraph of common knowledge and continues with several paragraphs of specialized knowledge. Learning one of these pieces of information about an elder evil requires an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check, as listed in the original book. While the DC of each check remains up to the DM, they should range from Moderate (DC 15) to Nearly Impossible (DC 30). Alternatively, the DM may decide that this information cannot be acquired except through certain methods of research or interaction with the campaign world.": "本节以一段常识开篇，接着是几段专门的知识。学习这些关于长者邪恶的信息之一需要进行智力（（%0%））或智力（（%1%））检查，如原书中所列。虽然每个检查的DC由DM决定，但它们的范围应该是从中等（DC 15）到几乎不可能（DC 30）。或者，DM可以决定，除非通过某些研究方法或与活动世界的互动，否则无法获得这些信息。",
	"This section follows the same format as the Background entry, but the lore entries reveal ever more secret details of the elder evil's ultimate purpose.": "这一部分遵循与背景条目相同的格式，但传说条目揭示了关于长老邪恶的最终目的的更多秘密细节。",
	"This section sets out a sample story arc with increasingly difficult challenges, culminating in the final confrontation with the elder evil. The Suggested Party Level (SPL) of these challenges correspond with strengthening signs of the apocalypse, as detailed later in this chapter. Each chapter includes a section that describes the game effects of that elder evil's sign.": "本节列出了一个故事弧的样本，其中的挑战难度越来越大，最后是与长老的邪恶对抗。这些挑战的建议等级（SPL）与加强的天启征兆相对应，详见本章后面的内容。每一章都有一节描述了该长老邪恶征兆的游戏效果。",
	"Two subsections suggest ways to adapt the elder evil to the {@i Forgotten Realms}® and {@i Eberron}™ campaign settings.": "有两个小节提出了使长者之恶适应{@i Forgotten Realms}®和{@i Eberron}™运动设置的方法。",
	"This subsection presents an original variant on how an elder evil might fit in a unique campaign setting, or it may present alternate plot hooks or story details to be used as appropriate.": "本小节介绍了一个关于长老级恶魔如何适合独特的战役背景的原创变体，或者它可能提出替代的情节钩子或故事细节，以酌情使用。",
	"You can adapt any of the example elder evils in this book so that they fit better into your setting's history. For example, planar campaigns or campaigns that use Spelljammers might wish to change the default locations given in the original book to better fit the setting they are a part of.": "你可以改编本书中的任何一个长老邪恶的例子，使其更适合你的设定的历史。例如，平面战役或使用咒语者的战役可能希望改变原书中给出的默认地点，以更好地适应他们所处的环境。",
	"Here follow physical details of the elder evil. Important servants and minions are also presented in this section, along with their statistics.": "下面是长老邪恶的身体细节。本节还介绍了重要的仆人和奴仆，以及他们的统计数据。",
	"Each entry has an overview map of the area in which the final confrontation occurs. Specific encounter areas are described in narrative, and a few are tied to tactical encounters at the end of the chapter.": "每个条目都有一张最终对抗发生区域的概览地图。具体的遭遇区域在叙述中进行了描述，有几个在章节末尾与战术遭遇联系在一起。",
	"Each tactical encounter includes a map of the room or area in which it takes place. The information includes creature statistics and tactics, initial positions of combatants, the locations of traps or other hazards, and other details important to the encounter.": "每个战术遭遇战都包括一个房间或区域的地图，它发生在那里。这些信息包括生物的统计数据和战术，战斗人员的初始位置，陷阱或其他危险的位置，以及对遭遇战重要的其他细节。",
	"An elder evil, or its mortal minions, might be active through the life of the campaign, but only when the horror awakens, arrives, or sets its plans in motion does the world know of it. This awakening manifests as a sign: the physical, magical, or psychological imprint of the elder evil. A sign reflects an aspect of the being's purpose and nature, and it influences the entire campaign setting. Sometimes it appears not by the will of the entity itself (which would rather not tip its hand), but as a warning from the gods, who are often constrained from direct involvement.": "一个年长的邪恶，或者它的凡人爪牙，可能在整个活动期间都是活跃的，但只有当这个恐怖的东西觉醒、到来，或者启动它的计划时，世界才知道它的存在。这种觉醒表现为一种征兆：长者邪恶的身体、魔法或心理上的印记。征兆反映了该生物的目的和性质的一个方面，它影响了整个活动的设置。有时，它的出现并不是出于实体本身的意愿（它宁可不出手），而是作为来自诸神的警告，而诸神往往被限制住，不能直接参与。",
	"When adjudicating a sign's influence, describe in flavorful narrative how it alters the world around the party. (Refer to the quotations that introduce each sign for inspiration to guide your story.)": "在评判一个标志的影响力时，用生动的叙述来描述它是如何改变当事人周围的世界的。(参考介绍每个标志的语录，以获得指导你故事的灵感）。",
	"After a sign appears and gains strength, its effect can be nearly as devastating as the elder evil itself; even if the threat is dealt with, this lingering influence leaves the world a much different place. Since signs have such widespread effects, handling them within the context of the game can be daunting. The sample story arcs in the following chapters suggest ways to heighten a given sign gradually over time. When it finally becomes overwhelming—heralding the imminent arrival of the threat—the party's average level should be high enough to resist all but the worst effects.": "在一个征兆出现并获得力量之后，它的影响几乎可以和长者的邪恶本身一样具有破坏性；即使威胁被解决了，这种挥之不去的影响也会使世界变得更加不同。由于征兆具有如此广泛的影响，在游戏的背景下处理它们可能是令人生畏的。下面几章中的故事样板暗示了随着时间的推移逐渐加强一个特定标志的方法。当它最终变得不堪一击时--预示着威胁即将到来--当事人的平均水平应该足够高，可以抵御除最坏影响之外的所有影响。",
	"To ordinary mortals, the appearance of a sign is a mysterious phenomenon—foreboding and sinister, to be sure, but without obvious significance. Only individuals who have the proper training and experience, who are steeped in ancient or forbidden knowledge, have any chance to recognize its grim implications.": "对普通人来说，征兆的出现是一种神秘的现象--肯定是不祥和的，但没有明显的意义。只有那些受过适当训练和有经验的人，那些沉浸在古代或禁忌知识中的人，才有机会认识到其严峻的含义。",
	"To identify a sign for what it is, a character must succeed on an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check, as appropriate. The check DC depends on the sign's intensity, as set out in the following table. As the effect of the sign becomes more pervasive, its meaning grows ever more clear. A faint sign might be simply unsettling, but at its height, its influence is inescapable.": "要辨别一个标志是什么，一个角色必须成功地进行智力（（%0%））或智力（（%1%））检查，根据情况而定。检查DC取决于标志的强度，如下表所示。随着标志的效果越来越普遍，它的意义也越来越清晰。一个微弱的征兆可能只是让人不安，但在它的高度，它的影响是不可避免的。",
	"Faint": "淡淡的",
	"Moderate": "中等水平",
	"Strong": "强大的",
	"Overwhelming": "压倒性的",
	"By succeeding on this check, a character knows the sign is an evil omen. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can identify the sign's strength, and succeeding by 10 or more reveals all the ramifications of its effect (including the identity of the elder evil).": "通过这个检查的成功，一个角色知道这个标志是一个邪恶的预兆。如果检定成功5个或更多，该角色可以识别该标志的强度，而成功10个或更多，则揭示其效果的所有后果（包括长者的身份）。",
	"The following signs are examples of those that could accompany an elder evil's approach; you might prefer to design your own, taking inspiration from these entries. Each section describes the effect of the sign at the four intensities listed above.": "下面的标志是可以伴随着长者邪恶的方法的例子；你可能更愿意从这些条目中获得灵感，设计你自己的标志。每一节都描述了该标志在上述四种强度下的效果。",

	"The pale disk of silver hanging in the night sky transforms, assuming a ghastly hue. At first, it darkens to an orange tone like that of a harvest moon, but as the sign approaches its peak, it turns the color of blood.": "悬挂在夜空中的苍白银盘发生了变化，呈现出一种可怕的色调。起初，它变暗为橙色，就像收获的月亮一样，但当这个标志接近它的峰值时，它变成了血的颜色。",
	"{@b Effect:} The sign of the blood moon sets tempers on edge, making living creatures irritable and aggressive. Ultimately, they are consumed by involuntary rage.": "{@b Effect:}血月的标志使脾气暴躁，使生物变得易怒和具有攻击性。最终，他们会被不由自主的愤怒所吞噬。",

	"When this sign appears, the light dies. The days grow shorter, and temperatures drop until finally the sun vanishes from the sky, plunging the world into perpetual night.": "当这个标志出现时，光线就会消失。白天越来越短，气温下降，直到最后太阳从天空消失，世界陷入永久的黑夜。",
	"{@b Effect:} Natural and magical lighting diminish as the sign strengthens, until the sun no longer rises.": "{@b Effect:}自然和魔法照明随着标志的加强而减少，直到太阳不再升起。",
	"{@b Details:} Father Llymic is associated with this sign. See Chapter 3 for more information.": "{@b Details:}父亲Llymic与这个星座有关。更多信息见第三章。",
	"{@b Variant:} Instead of the sun disappearing completely, planetary rotation slows so that, ultimately, one side of the world is bathed in perpetual light while the other is plunged into eternal darkness. The effects of the sign on the dark side function as normal. On the light side, the effects are reversed: The range of natural light sources doubles; sunrise occurs earlier and sunset later; spells that produce darkness are impeded and light-producing spells are enhanced. Finally, global average temperatures climb rather than drop. The glaring light and heat are as great a disaster as endless dark, ultimately rendering the light side a lifeless ruin.": "{@b Variant:}太阳并没有完全消失，而是行星自转变慢，因此，最终，世界的一边沐浴在永恒的光亮中，而另一边则陷入永恒的黑暗中。黑暗面的标志的影响如常运作。在光明的一面，影响则相反：自然光源的范围增加了一倍；日出时间提前，日落时间推迟；产生黑暗的法术受到阻碍，产生光明的法术得到加强。最后，全球平均气温不降反升。耀眼的光和热与无尽的黑暗一样是巨大的灾难，最终使光明面成为无生命的废墟。",
	"Frogs fell from the sky for hours. The next day, flaming stones showered us, killing all they touched. Then it snowed for three weeks. Who knows what's next?": "青蛙从天而降，持续数小时。第二天，燃烧的石头向我们袭来，杀死了所有它们接触到的东西。然后下了三个星期的雪。谁知道接下来会发生什么？",
	"This sign alters the weather in drastic and unnatural ways. Snow in the summer and sweltering heat in the winter are just the beginning. Hurricanes lash the coastlines, destroy villages, or flood entire cities; tornadoes rip apart the countryside; and bizarre weather effects become commonplace. All the while, sickening green clouds form, and violet lightning dances between them.": "这个标志以急剧和非自然的方式改变了天气。夏天的雪和冬天的酷热仅仅是个开始。飓风袭击海岸线，摧毁村庄，或淹没整个城市；龙卷风撕裂了乡村；怪异的天气效应变得司空见惯。与此同时，令人作呕的绿色云层形成，紫色的闪电在云层之间飞舞。",
	"{@b Effect:} When this sign manifests, it creates strange and random meteorological effects. The intensity of the sign determines the extent, duration, and frequency of the unusual weather.": "{@b Effect:}当这个星座表现出来的时候，它会产生奇怪和随机的气象效应。该星座的强度决定了异常天气的范围、持续时间和频率。",

	"{@b Effect:} The type of infestation depends on the nature of the elder evil. Aberrations, animals, plants, oozes, undead, and vermin are typical choices, though some magical beasts, outsiders, and even humanoids could work too. As the sign grows in strength, so too do the numbers, increasing the challenge of the encounter. The creatures spread throughout the campaign setting as the sign grows stronger, and encounters range from single fights to desperate stands against vast armies.": "{@b Effect:} 侵扰的类型取决于长老邪恶的性质。畸形、动物、植物、渗虫、亡灵和害虫是典型的选择，尽管一些魔兽、外来者，甚至是人类也可以。随着信号的增强，数量也在增加，增加了遭遇战的挑战。随着征兆的增强，生物会遍布整个战役环境，而遭遇的范围也从单一的战斗到不顾一切地对抗大军。",

	"When this sign appears, the demarcation between life and death grows ever more blurry. After souls depart, their bodies stir in a wretched existence neither alive nor dead. The sign of the restless dead first makes itself known by isolated occurrences of zombies and skeletons in the community. As it strengthens, the undead plague increases. Corpses pull themselves free from graves, slaughtering former friends and lovers and swelling their ranks until only the shuffling dead remain.": "当这个标志出现时，生与死的分界线就变得越来越模糊。灵魂离开后，他们的身体在一种既不活也不死的悲惨生活中搅动。不安的死人征兆首先通过社区中孤立出现的僵尸和骷髅而为人所知。随着它的加强，亡灵瘟疫也在增加。尸体从坟墓中挣脱出来，屠杀以前的朋友和恋人，扩大他们的队伍，直到只剩下摇摇欲坠的死者。",
	"{@b Effect:} In the early stages of this sign, only a few of the dead spontaneously animate. Necromancy magic becomes more efficacious, while healing magic is suppressed. As the sign intensifies, more and more corpses rise, growing stronger all the while.": "{@b Effect:} 在这个征兆的早期阶段，只有少数死者会自发地活过来。亡灵魔法变得更加有效，而治疗魔法则受到抑制。随着征兆的加强，越来越多的尸体复活，同时越来越强大。",

	"{@b Effect:} The seal of binding interferes with most conjuration spells and many divination spells by closing off the avenues that enable mortals to interact with the planes. Clerics' connections with the divine are severed, summoned creatures do not return to their home planes, and dimensional travel ceases to function.": "{@b Effect:} 捆绑之印通过关闭使凡人能够与位面互动的途径，干扰了大多数魔法咒语和许多占卜咒语。牧师与神灵的联系被切断，被召唤的生物不能回到他们的主位面，维度旅行也停止运作。",

	"This sign first manifests with accelerated healing. Soon, though, living creatures and inanimate objects become covered with festering boils, which burst to expel swarms of pests. Not long after this boon comes a light rain of spores, dotting the landscape with foul growths that spawn horrid abominations and spread corruption across the land. As the sign strengthens, wounds close almost instantly, but flesh grows pustulent and bones distend as life becomes corrupted. At its peak, all undead but the most powerful and hidden are obliterated. The dead rise as gibbering aberrations, and the living mutate into twisted progeny.": "这个征兆首先表现为加速愈合。但很快，生物和无生命的物体就会被溃烂的疖子覆盖，这些疖子爆裂后会排出成群的害虫。在这一好处之后不久，就下起了孢子的小雨，在风景中点缀着肮脏的生长物，产生可怕的憎恶，并在整个土地上传播腐败。随着征兆的加强，伤口几乎立即愈合，但随着生命的堕落，肉体逐渐化脓，骨骼膨胀。在它的巅峰时期，除了最强大和最隐蔽的亡灵，所有的亡灵都会被消灭。死者复活为胡言乱语的畸形人，而活人则变异为扭曲的后代。",

	"The peasants believed they had been blessed: Their crops grew quickly, women bore healthy children in weeks rather than months, and the harvest was the best ever. At first, life was good. But the growth never slowed. Everything birthed and died with such speed that we could hear Nature suffering. Disease was rampant, and vermin spread it everywhere; there was no end to the screams of the afflicted.": "农民们相信他们得到了祝福。他们的庄稼长得很快，妇女在几周而不是几个月内就能生出健康的孩子，而且收获是有史以来最好的。起初，生活很好。但增长从未放缓。一切都以如此快的速度诞生和死亡，我们可以听到大自然的痛苦。疾病猖獗，害虫到处传播；受折磨的人的尖叫声不绝于耳。",
	"Growth and healing are accelerated. At first crops and animals grow and reproduce with unnatural swiftness, and injuries vanish overnight.

	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} The priests contact the party once more. Having deciphered the old tome, the clerics suspect whoever sought the book intends to summon the World Born Dead. The manuscript offers few details, and the clerics have been unable to elicit any concrete answers from their god. They do uncover the name of another tome: The {@item book of vile darkness}. They ask the characters to locate this book before their enemy uncovers it. The party must research and follow up on leads to find its resting place, all the while facing innumerable cultists who seek the same end. To make matters worse, the party hears reports from all over about how the dead have begun to rise from their graves.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} 牧师们再次联系党。在破译了这本古老的书之后，牧师们怀疑寻求这本书的人打算召唤出世界上的亡灵。手稿提供的细节很少，神职人员也无法从他们的神那里得到任何具体的答案。他们确实发现了另一本手稿的名字。{@item book of vile darkness}。他们要求人物在他们的敌人发现这本书之前找到它。队伍必须研究并追踪线索以找到它的藏身之处，同时还要面对无数寻求相同目的的邪教分子。更糟糕的是，他们听到了来自各地的报告，说死者已经开始从坟墓中复活。",
	"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} Sensing an opportunity to make a decisive strike against his ancient enemy, Orcus dispatches his legions, led by a bodak named Gorguth, to invade Demogorgon's layer, the Gaping Maw. This strike plunges the Abyss into widespread war, with demon lords and princes lining up against one another to settle old scores. The Dark Eight of the Nine Hells perceive this infighting as a weakness and for the first time mount a successful invasion into the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. During the interplanar wars, Gorguth forswears his allegiance to Orcus and leads his undead armies into the Material Plane through a {@spell gate} created by cultists in the service of Atropus.": "{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):}感觉到有机会对他古老的敌人进行决定性的打击，奥库斯派遣他的军团，在一个名叫戈尔古斯的波达克的带领下，入侵德摩戈根的层，大嘴。这次袭击使深渊陷入了广泛的战争，恶魔领主和王子们相互排挤，以解决旧账。九层地狱的黑暗八人组将这种内讧视为一种弱点，并首次成功入侵深渊的无限层。在星际战争中，戈尔古斯放弃了对奥库斯的效忠，带领他的亡灵军队通过一个由为阿特罗普斯服务的邪教徒创造的{@spell gate}进入物质界。",
	"Meanwhile, Caira recovers the {@item book of vile darkness} and learns that the elder evil will come if a tragedy of terrible and widespread death were to occur. She researches the {@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE} spell, during which time she sends out her minions to collect a sample of angel tears she intends to use to complete the casting of the spell. The party might be drawn into the fighting on the planes, join the battle against Gorguth, or follow up their leads about Caira.": "与此同时，凯拉找回了{@item book of vile darkness}，并了解到如果发生可怕的大面积死亡的悲剧，长者的邪恶就会降临。她研究了{@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE}的法术，在此期间，她派出了她的部下去收集天使之泪的样本，她打算用它来完成施法。党派可能会被卷入平面上的战斗，加入对戈尔古斯的战斗，或者追踪他们关于凯拉的线索。",
	"{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} The undead outnumber the living, spreading like a cancer. Gorguth's armies beat back the defenders, filling their depleted ranks by turning their fallen adversaries into undead. Gorguth marches toward the metropolis where he intends to greet the elder evil when it arrives. Meanwhile, Caira completes her research and begins the daylong casting from her hidden base beneath the city. From one of her captured minions or another ally they met along the way, the party learns of her horrible plan and must decide whether they will stand against the fast-approaching undead army or seek out the ur-priest in the hope of halting her fell magic.": "{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} 亡灵的数量超过了活人，像癌症一样蔓延开来。高古特的军队击退了守军，通过把倒下的对手变成亡灵来填补他们枯竭的队伍。高尔基斯向大都市进军，他打算在那里迎接邪恶老人的到来。与此同时，凯拉完成了她的研究，并开始从她隐藏在城市下面的基地进行为期一天的铸造。从她俘虏的一个爪牙或沿途遇到的另一个盟友那里，一行人得知了她的可怕计划，他们必须决定是要对抗快速逼近的亡灵大军，还是要找寻乌尔牧师，希望能阻止她的堕落魔法。",

Alternatively, if the party faced Gorguth and defeated it, Caira completes the spell and bathes everything in a 100-mile radius with fiery death, killing tens of thousands. This calamity is enough to awaken Atropus, and the moonlet begins to descend toward the planet. Surviving spellcasters cast {@spell gate} spells to transport people to the Plane of Shadow, trying to save as many as they can, leaving the party as the world's last chance to stop Atropus. They must travel to the moonlet, brave the void, and find and defeat the aspect of Atropus before the moonlet reaches the planet's surface.": "{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):}如果党派阻止了凯拉，这只是短暂的胜利，因为戈尔古斯接近了，他的成群的恶魔和亡灵涌入城市，将死亡和破坏扩散到整个城市。另外，如果党派面对戈尔古斯并将其击败，凯拉就会完成咒语，用火热的死亡沐浴方圆100英里内的一切，杀死数万人。这场灾难足以唤醒阿特罗普斯，而小月球开始向地球降落。幸存的施法者施展{@spell gate}的法术，将人们传送到影子世界，试图尽可能多地拯救他们，留下党作为世界上阻止阿特罗普斯的最后机会。他们必须前往小月球，勇敢面对虚空，并在小月球到达地球表面之前找到并击败阿特罗普斯的一面。",
	"Given the elusive character of the gods in the Eberron setting, it is not clear what or who Atropus is. The oldest mentions of this entity date back to the Age of Demons, marking Atropus's appearance during the climactic sacrifice of the couatls in their attempt to rid their world of the demons and force them to their native plane. In the millennia that followed, astronomers have commented on the passage of an anomalous comet that seems to appear whenever Dolurrh, Realm of the Dead, is coterminous with the Material Plane. Some theorize this comet is in fact Atropus of legend, and one day the World Born Dead will visit Eberron again.": "鉴于Eberron设定中诸神的难以捉摸的特性，我们并不清楚阿特罗普斯是什么或谁。关于这个实体的最古老的记载可以追溯到恶魔时代，标志着阿特罗普斯在库阿特尔人试图摆脱他们的世界并迫使他们回到自己的星球的高潮祭祀中出现。在随后的几千年里，天文学家们对一颗异常的彗星的通过进行了评论，这颗彗星似乎在死神之域多鲁尔与物质世界相接的时候出现。有些人认为这颗彗星其实就是传说中的阿特罗普斯，有一天，生而为人的亡灵世界会再次访问埃伯龙。",
	"Outside of the dragons peering into the heavens to divine the future, few comprehend the significance of the movements of the celestial bodies. If mortals knew the evil far above their heads, they would quake in their boots and seek refuge in the bowels of the earth. Indeed, only the Argonnessen dragons know what doom awaits them all, for they have identified a celestial object whose appearance occurred at the same time that Cyre became the Mournland. It is an odd thing moving through the Ring of Siberys. Some suspect magical manifestation, maybe a planar anomaly, but a few know the truth, and they do their best to push such thoughts from their minds, lest they draw its attention by dwelling on what many believe is the inevitable end of the world.": "除了那些窥视天堂以预知未来的龙之外，很少有人能理解天体运动的意义。如果凡人知道他们头顶上的邪恶，他们就会颤抖不已，在地底寻求庇护。事实上，只有Argonnessen龙知道等待他们所有人的是什么厄运，因为他们已经确定了一个天体，其出现的时间与赛尔城成为哀牢地的时间相同。这是一个奇怪的东西，在西伯利亚之环中移动。有些人怀疑是魔法的表现，也许是一个平面异常，但也有少数人知道真相，他们尽力把这种想法从脑海中推开，以免他们因纠缠于许多人认为是不可避免的世界末日而引起它的注意。",
	"Those few sages who even know of Atropus debate the origins of this elder evil. They agree that Atropus was spawned when Ao created the first gods, but where they differ is in how Atropus was formed. Some claim the elder evil gained awareness from the divine amniotic fluid surrounding the first god of death, while others claim Atropus was the last god Ao created, but it was stillborn. Atropus has never come close to Faerûn, but those aware of it are ever watchful of the heavens, waiting for the day when the moonlet circles the tapestry of night.": "少数知道阿特罗普斯的圣人对这位长者的邪恶的起源进行了辩论。他们一致认为阿特罗普斯是在奥创造第一批神时产生的，但他们的分歧在于阿特罗普斯是如何形成的。有些人声称这个长老级恶魔从围绕着第一个死神的神圣羊水中获得了意识，而其他人则声称阿特罗普斯是敖创造的最后一个神，但它是死胎。阿特罗普斯从未接近过法鲁恩，但那些意识到它的人一直在监视着天堂，等待着小月亮绕过黑夜织锦的那一天。",
	"The moonlet is one of the drifting bodies forming the ring around the dull gray planet known as Glyth, one of the Five Wanderers that do not follow the ordinary paths of the stars. Little do the mortals of Faerûn realize the cataclysm affecting this distant world. Drawn by the widespread death and destruction meted out by mind flayer overlords, Atropus drew close, masking its approach behind the belt of debris forming the ring around the planet. While the illithids waged their interminable wars against the native humanoids, Atropus descended and wiped out all life, leaving Glyth an empty husk. Now Atropus turns its attention to Faerûn and begins its slide toward a world ripe for the taking": "这颗小月球是形成环形的漂流体之一，围绕着被称为Glyth的暗灰色星球，是不遵循普通星轨的五个流浪者中的一个。Faerûn的凡人很少意识到影响这个遥远世界的大灾变。被弑神者的大范围死亡和破坏所吸引，阿特罗普斯接近了，并将它的接近掩盖在形成行星周围环形的碎片带后面。当illithids对本地人类发动无休止的战争时，Atropus降临并消灭了所有的生命，留下Glyth一个空壳。现在，Atropus将注意力转向了Faerûn，并开始向一个成熟的世界滑去。",
	"Instead of constraining Atropus to be a leftover creation of the overgod Ao, a DM may wish to relate Atropus to Ao in a more equal manner, or they may wish to remove Ao from the setting altogether. In the latter case, use the default lore provided in the Background section to explain Atropus's origins.": "与其将阿特罗普斯限制为超神奥的遗留物，DM可能希望以更平等的方式将阿特罗普斯与奥联系起来，或者他们可能希望将奥从设定中完全删除。在后一种情况下，使用背景部分提供的默认传说来解释阿特罗普斯的起源。",
	"Rather than being free to roam the Material Plane, Atropus could languish in stasis on the Negative Energy Plane. Once released, it might seek to transform all the Outer Planes into a mass graveyard. In this case, the Restless Dead sign could represent Atropus drawing nearer to a given plane, intensifying until Atropus is able to enter the plane.": "阿特罗普斯不是自由地在物质界游荡，而是在负能量位面静止不动地等待。一旦被释放，它可能会寻求将所有外层世界变成一个集体墓地。在这种情况下，无休止的死亡征兆可能代表阿特罗普斯正在接近某个特定的平面，并不断加强，直到阿特罗普斯能够进入该平面。",
	"The default Sign of Apocalypse for Atropus is certainly a major effect in your campaign world, but some may find it unsatisfying that the Sign is a passive effect that is simply a byproduct of Atropus's approach. If you wish to make Atropus feel more like an active threat, allow more powerful undead in service to Atropus to descend from the moonlet to your campaign setting. For example, you can take advantage of Atropus's connection to Atropals to make them effective heralds of the moonlet's approach. As stillborn creatures from the Negative Energy plane, atropals also serve as effective heralds in planar campaigns, acting as forerunners for the much larger threat to come.": "阿特罗普斯的默认天启标志在你的战役世界中当然是一个重要的效果，但有些人可能会觉得不满意，因为这个标志是一个被动的效果，只是阿特罗普斯做法的一个副产品。如果你想让阿特罗普斯感觉更像一个主动的威胁，可以让更多为阿特罗普斯服务的强大的亡灵从月球上降临到你的竞选环境中。例如，你可以利用阿特罗普斯与阿特罗帕斯的联系，让他们成为小月球接近的有效传令者。作为来自负能量位面的静止生物，阿托帕斯在平面战役中也是有效的预言家，为即将到来的更大的威胁充当先驱者。",
	"You can also consider other threats to act as villains in anticipation of Atropus's arrival. For example, while the original outline suggests that Orcus be involved in an interplanar war, you may wish for Orcus himself to beckon Atropus's arrival. In this case, the Bleak General might be a loyal servant of Orcus, rather than betraying him in favor of Atropus. Another villains include Acererak, Lady Illmarrow (and the Order of the Emerald Claw), an aspiring lich or mummy lord, a god of undeath, or a fallen angel or undead celestial. Perhaps even the Worm That Walks (chapter 9) has taken an interest in Atropus, and has decided to ally with the World Born Dead so that it may rule the dead world that Atropus leaves behind.": "你也可以考虑让其他威胁作为反派，以期待阿特罗普斯的到来。例如，虽然原来的大纲建议奥卡斯参与星际战争，但你可能希望奥卡斯本人招来阿特罗普斯的到来。在这种情况下，黯淡将军可能会成为奥卡斯的忠实仆人，而不是背叛他而支持阿特罗普斯。另一个反派包括阿克雷拉克（Acererak）、伊尔马罗夫人（以及翡翠之爪骑士团）、有抱负的巫师或木乃伊领主、不死之神，或堕落的天使或不死天体。甚至可能是 \"会走路的虫子\"（第9章）对阿特罗普斯产生了兴趣，并决定与 \"生生不息的世界 \"结盟，以便统治阿特罗普斯留下的死亡世界。",
	"Additionally, feel free to alter the details as to how Atropus is summoned. The suggested campaign outline gives two ways for Atropus to be summoned: the {@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE} spell, obtained through the {@item book of vile darkness}, or the massacre of a major city by demonic forces. Below are additional possibilities for how Atropus might be summoned:": "此外，请随意修改关于如何召唤阿特罗普斯的细节。建议的活动大纲给出了两种召唤阿特罗普斯的方式：通过{@item book of vile darkness}获得的{@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE}法术，或者恶魔势力对一座大城市的屠杀。以下是阿特罗普斯可能被召唤的其他可能性。",
	"Perhaps a certain artifact or magical object must be destroyed in order to summon Atropus. For example, maybe the {@item book of exalted deeds} can be temporarily destroyed using a {@item talisman of ultimate evil}, the act of which awakens Atropus and draws it towards the setting. Alternatively, perhaps a dimensional seal or a planar barrier prevents Atropus from entering a given plane or approaching a given planet, and if destroyed, the World Born Dead will be free to approach and annihilate it.": "也许为了召唤阿特罗普斯，必须摧毁某件神器或魔法物品。例如，也许{@item book of exalted deeds}可以用{@item talisman of ultimate evil}来暂时摧毁，这个行为会唤醒阿特罗普斯，并把它引向这个环境。或者，也许一个维度封印或一个平面屏障可以阻止阿特罗普斯进入一个特定的平面或接近一个特定的星球，如果被摧毁，世界生灵就会自由地接近并消灭它。",
	"In Eberron, an eldritch machine, as detailed in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, may be used to channel large amounts of negative energy in order to cause mass death, or it may simply be used as a homing beacon that entices Atropus to approach the setting.": "在Eberron，如{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中所详述的那样，长生机可以用来引导大量的负能量，以造成大规模的死亡，或者它可以简单地用作诱导Atropus接近设定的归宿信标。",
	"In a planar setting, cultists of the World Born Dead might perform a ritual to break down the barriers that separate the planes, allowing Atropus to pass through a large planar portal into the target plane.": "在一个平面环境中，\"生而为人 \"的邪教徒可能会举行仪式，打破分隔各平面的屏障，让阿特罗普斯通过一个大型平面门户进入目标平面。",
	"In a Spelljammer campaign, Atropus might be on a set path through the cosmos. If it isn't stopped in time, Atropus might destroy a major planetary hub or a capital of a large civilization.": "在Spelljammer战役中，Atropus可能会在宇宙中走一条固定的路线。如果不及时阻止它，阿特罗普斯可能会摧毁一个主要的行星中心或一个大型文明的首都。",
	"Lastly, feel free to use the {@creature Aspect of Atropus|EdE} in new and creative ways. For example, perhaps cultists seek to summon the Aspect of Atropus directly to their world; if they succeed, the aspect will annihilate them and every other creature in the setting. Perhaps a villain seeks to take advantage of the aspect for their own gain. If they absorb or take control of the aspect somehow, they may gain control of the moonlet, or their consciousness might be merged with the World Born Dead itself. Any villain will recognize that the World Born Dead holds the ultimate power over death and undeath, and that if this can be taken advantage of, they will be unstoppable.": "最后，请自由地以新的和创造性的方式使用（%0%）。例如，也许邪教分子试图将阿特罗普斯之神直接召唤到他们的世界；如果他们成功了，阿特罗普斯之神就会消灭他们和环境中的所有其他生物。也许一个恶棍想利用这个方面来谋取自己的利益。如果他们以某种方式吸收或控制了这个方面，他们可能会获得对小月亮的控制，或者他们的意识可能会与 \"生而为人 \"本身合并。任何恶棍都会认识到，\"生而为人 \"拥有对死亡和不死的终极力量，如果能利用这一点，他们将是不可阻挡的。",

Some died unnatural deaths, while others merely ceased to function, going into a sort of dormancy until conditions would be right for them to thrive. One such entity seemed to have an aversion to light. Although it was paralyzed, some aspect of this creature remained able to send illusory projections, beckoning the unwary to visit his unmoving form. These projections gave Father Llymic his name, since the twisted monstrosity was hidden beneath an illusion of a kindly old man.": "远方世界的生物不遵守自然法则；它们的异类性质对与它们接触的人来说是致命的。然而，世界也会以奇怪的方式影响它们。浩瀚之门的幸存者所做的古老记录指出，一些远界实体不能生活在这个世界上。一些人非正常死亡，而另一些人只是停止了功能，进入了一种休眠状态，直到条件适合他们茁壮成长。一个这样的实体似乎对光有一种厌恶。虽然它瘫痪了，但这个生物的某些方面仍然能够发出虚幻的投影，召唤不小心的人去看他不动的形式。这些投影给了Llymic神父他的名字，因为这个扭曲的怪物被隐藏在一个慈祥的老人的幻觉之下。",
	"Although dormant, Father Llymic still proved deadly. Those fooled by his illusions were soon tainted by his corruption and had to be destroyed. Although exposing him to light caused dormancy, it also caused his form to radiate waves of deadly cold. Soon, sheets of ice began to engulf his body. The elves moved him to a mountaintop, where his chill would not harm anyone and the light of the sun might keep him dormant forever. The few remaining caretaker elves eventually died, and Father Llymic was forgotten.": "虽然处于休眠状态，但Llymic神父仍然被证明是致命的。那些被他的幻觉所迷惑的人很快就被他的腐败所玷污，不得不被摧毁。虽然将他暴露在光线下会导致休眠，但也会使他的身体散发出致命的寒气。很快，冰片开始吞噬他的身体。精灵们把他移到一个山顶上，在那里他的寒气不会伤害任何人，太阳的光芒可能会让他永远休眠。剩下的几个看守精灵最终都死了，Llymic神父也被遗忘了。",
	"Legends about Father Llymic grow vague beyond the confines of his mountain prison.

Only the most thorough chronicler might notice that one mountain in particular is full of strange tales regarding missing travelers and reclusive natives. The obvious sign of Father Llymic's coming—the darkening of the sun—means that it is almost too late to stop him from waking.": "由于他潜伏在这样一个荒凉的地方，这位长者的邪恶很容易被添加到任何活动中。只有当Llymic神父接近他的全部力量时，效果才会变得明显，因为太阳开始失去遏制他的力量。地形很容易隐藏他的孩子，旅行者和偏远山区的部族一直在失踪。只有最彻底的编年史家才会注意到，有一座山特别充满了关于失踪的旅行者和隐居的当地人的奇怪故事。Llymic神父到来的明显迹象--太阳变暗--意味着要阻止他醒来几乎已经太晚。",

Headed by Tierad Rynesten, the adventuresome daughter of a nobleman, the caravan left three weeks ago but has not been heard from since. Tierad's father seeks out adventurers to track down the caravan and rescue his daughter. Unfortunately for Tierad, he ran afoul of a tribe of barbarians living in the mountain—a tribe that secretly venerates the frozen god that dwells on the peak. Although many of the drovers have been sacrificed or eaten, some remain to be taken to Father Llymic for his blessed touch. If the party frees Tierad, she tells them of the strange rituals practiced by the barbarians and the way that sometimes they would change, taking on inhuman icy features before leaving the tribe forever. This plot can be set in any city that has a large mountain and other villages nearby. Ideally, the party worked for Tierad's father in the past, making them the logical choice for his call for aid.": "{@b SPL 6:} 整个商队在穿越附近的山口时失踪了。这支商队由一个贵族的冒险女儿蒂拉德-莱恩斯滕（Tierad Rynesten）率领，三周前出发，但此后就没有了消息。蒂拉德的父亲寻找冒险家来追踪商队并救出他的女儿。不幸的是，提拉德碰上了住在山里的野蛮人部落--一个秘密崇拜住在山顶的冰冻之神的部落。虽然许多牧民已经被牺牲或吃掉了，但仍有一些人被带到Llymic神父那里接受他的祝福。如果党派释放了蒂拉德，她会告诉他们野蛮人举行的奇怪仪式，以及他们有时会改变的方式，在永远离开部落之前呈现出非人的冰冷特征。这个情节可以设置在任何有一座大山和附近其他村庄的城市。理想的情况是，这支队伍过去曾为提拉德的父亲工作，使他们成为提拉德呼唤援助的合理选择。",
	"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} An icy glacier begins to creep down the mountain where Tierad was once held prisoner. A small town nearby is dealing with harsh winter conditions (regardless of the actual season). Any friends the party might have in this village call for their help as strange ice creatures begin murdering the remaining livestock and villagers. Although the threat can be beaten back, the town must eventually be abandoned to the grinding ice. The only thing left behind is the image of an old man who wanders the streets and never draws close to anyone, but always beckons onlookers toward the mountain.": "{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):}一个冰冷的冰川开始从提拉德曾经被关押的山上爬下来。附近的一个小镇正在应对严酷的冬季条件（无论实际季节如何）。当奇怪的冰雪生物开始谋杀剩余的牲畜和村民时，党在这个村子里的任何朋友都会向他们求救。虽然威胁可以被击退，但该镇最终必须被抛弃在磨碎的冰层中。唯一留下的是一个老人的形象，他在街道上徘徊，从不接近任何人，但总是向围观的人招手，让他们走向山。",
	"{@b SPL 13 (Moderate Sign):} As the ice from the mountain spreads and the days grow noticeably shorter, darkness begins to settle over the land. Rumors from all around the area report ice creatures prowling the night and constant disappearances. One small town has gone completely silent. Drawn to the place, the party finds it the home of horrible ice monsters, as if all the villagers have been transformed into mockeries of their former selves. The old man appears again, this time grinning with a maw of icy fangs, beckoning to the looming glacial peak in the distance.": "{@b SPL 13 (Moderate Sign):} 随着山中的冰块蔓延，白昼明显变短，黑暗开始笼罩大地。来自该地区各地的传言称，冰雪生物在夜间徘徊，并不断有人失踪。一个小镇已经完全沉寂了。队伍被吸引到这个地方，发现它是可怕的冰怪的家，好像所有的村民都变成了他们以前的模样。老人再次出现，这次他咧开冰冷的獠牙大嘴，向远处隐约可见的冰川山峰招手。",
	"{@b SPl 16 (Strong Sign):} The sun is barely visible in the sky, and snow and ice cover the land. Entire villages are empty, and terrible ice creatures roam the land. In one final desperate measure, the local lord entreats the party to solve this problem, giving them whatever resources he can muster. There is only one place to go: the mountain. While the characters climb its snowbound slopes, all manner of alien ice creatures try to slow their ascent, leading to a terrible conflict with the keepers of the summit: a tribe of converted frost giants (see Encounter 1).": "{@b SPl 16 (Strong Sign):} 天空中几乎看不到太阳，冰雪覆盖大地。整个村庄空无一人，可怕的冰雪生物在这片土地上游荡。在最后的绝望措施中，当地的领主恳求党派解决这个问题，给他们提供他能调动的任何资源。只有一个地方可以去：山。当角色们爬上雪山的时候，各种外来的冰雪生物试图减缓他们的上升速度，导致他们与山顶的守护者发生可怕的冲突：一个由冰霜巨人组成的部落（见遭遇1）。",
	"{@b SPL 19 (Overwhelming Sign):} As the party reaches the mountain's peak, the sun no longer rises and the temperature keeps dropping. There is no sunlight anymore, and those who don't have darkvision are practically blind. At the summit, the party encounters the most powerful representatives of Father Llymic's brood, including a transformed dragon. After braving these last challenges, Father Llymic's icy form finally stirs. His gigantic alien bulk shatters the last sheet of ice and surveys the perfect darkness he has created (see Encounters 2 and 3).": "{@b SPL 19 (Overwhelming Sign):} 当队伍到达山顶时，太阳不再升起，温度不断下降。没有阳光了，没有暗视的人几乎是瞎子。在山顶，队伍遇到了Llymic神父的最强大的代表，包括一条变身的龙。在经历了这些最后的挑战之后，Llymic神父的冰冷形态终于出现了。他巨大的外星体型击碎了最后一片冰层，并勘察了他所创造的完美的黑暗环境（见遭遇2和3）。",
	"Only after Father Llymic's defeat might the sun rise again and the world begin to thaw. What world is left, however, is for you to decide.": "只有在Llymic神父被打败后，太阳才可能重新升起，世界才会开始解冻。然而，剩下的是什么世界，要由你来决定。"
