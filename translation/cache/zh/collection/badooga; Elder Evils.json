Unaware that the draudnus slew their employer, the babaus snuck into the church, leaving their tracks about the grounds. The draudnus soon followed and assaulted the church directly, one of their number falling in a pitched battle that took the lives of a large number of clerics and monks.

	"Having no need for sustenance doesn't stop these dim creatures from hunting. Black cysts seem to take special delight from dissolving the flesh of their victims, and when they kill a mortal, they set to work liquefying the victim with their unspeakable essences in a process that can take hours.

	"Cursing with every step, begging his feet to turn around so he might save his friends, his body denied him for the fear had a grip on his heart and there was no turning back. So he ran.

The sounds of his pursuers were close. Too close.": "他每走一步都在咒骂，求他的脚转过来，这样他就可以救他的朋友，但他的身体拒绝了他，因为恐惧已经控制了他的心，没有回头路了。于是他跑了起来。他跑了几分钟，但感觉像是几天，在恐慌中，他失去了对自己位置的追踪，在荒凉的走廊和被诅咒的矿井生锈的栏杆中失去了自我。当他的呼吸变得急促，身边的疼痛迫使他停下来时，他倒下了，泪水从他的眼睛里涌出，小小的啜泣声从他干裂的嘴唇里逸出。他知道自己必死无疑。追兵的声音很近。太近了。",

	"Fleeing through the tunnels, he eventually became lost and stumbled into a chamber containing a great abomination, a fragment of Tharizdun's personality severed at the time of his imprisonment. Giorge's sudden arrival and the approach of more fishfolk hunters caused the great horror to awaken and snatch Giorge, plunging the mortal into the thickened waters contaminated by its rot. Beneath the churning surface, the entity known as Shothragot infested Giorge's mind, rent his spirit, and seized his body, transforming it into something else entirely.": "在隧道中逃亡，他最终迷失了方向，偶然进入了一个装有巨大憎恶的房间，那是塔里兹敦在被囚禁时被切断的人格碎片。乔吉的突然到来和更多的鱼人猎人的接近使巨大的恐怖苏醒并抓住了乔吉，使这个凡人陷入了被它的腐烂所污染的浓水之中。在汹涌的水面下，被称为Shothragot的实体侵袭了Giorge的思想，撕裂了他的精神，并抓住了他的身体，将其完全转化为另一种东西。",
	"The elder evil awakened a trace of fiendish blood that lay dormant in the broken ranger, causing him to become a tiefling. The severe agony of transformation shattered Giorge's mind, and when he was spit out upon the shores, he gibbered like an idiot, shrieking and laughing by turns for days on end. But the thing in the pool was not through with its first disciple.": "长老的邪恶唤醒了沉睡在这个残破游侠体内的一丝恶魔之血，使他变成了一个铁弗林。变身的剧烈痛苦击碎了乔吉的心灵，当他被吐在岸边时，他像个白痴一样叽叽喳喳地叫着，连续几天轮流尖叫和大笑。但池中的东西并没有完成它的第一个弟子。",
	"Shothragot swelled out from the pool's depths and instructed Giorge to go forth to spread the news of its coming, and also to find and destroy its enemies. The new champion had no choice but to agree since Shothragot possessed his soul. And so he went out into the world, scouring the lands through which he traveled for those he perceived as threats and for those marked by his god as being chosen to die. When he finds them, he does as he has been commanded. He kills.": "Shothragot从池子的深处膨胀出来，并指示Giorge前去传播它到来的消息，同时也要找到并消灭它的敌人。新冠军别无选择，只能同意，因为肖特拉戈特拥有他的灵魂。于是他走向世界，在他所经过的土地上搜寻那些他认为是威胁的人，以及那些被他的神标记为被选中的人。当他找到他们时，他就按照他的命令行事。他杀了人。",
	"The experience in the Crater Ridge Mines left Giorge Forsworn changed in body and mind. The physical changes, while profound, compared little to the evil filling the vessel of his soul. The entity in the shadowy cave filled his mind with disturbing visions of apocalypse and planted instructions that grew and thrived in the haunted corridors of his thoughts. Now when he draws close to an individual Shothragot deems a threat—no matter how minor—Giorge sees a fiery glyph burning on her brow. This sigil marks those Giorge must kill even though each murder pained him, reducing him to tears for he knew in his heart that what he did was wrong. But Giorge serves because nothing else is permitted to him—nothing beyond furthering his master's ambitions, and no doubt—no hesitation—will ever stop him from fulfilling his profane duty.": "在火山口岭矿区的经历使乔吉-福斯沃恩的身体和心灵都发生了变化。身体上的变化虽然很深刻，但与充斥在他灵魂容器中的邪恶相比，却显得微不足道。阴暗洞穴中的实体在他的脑海中充满了令人不安的天启幻象，并种下了指令，这些指令在他思想的鬼魂走廊中成长和茁壮。现在，当他接近一个被Shothragot视为威胁的人时--无论多么微小--乔治看到她的眉毛上燃烧着一个火红的石刻。这个符号标志着Giorge必须杀死的人，尽管每一次谋杀都让他感到痛苦，让他流泪，因为他心里知道他的所作所为是错误的。但乔尔格服役的原因是，除了促进他主人的野心之外，他没有别的选择，没有任何怀疑--没有任何犹豫--会阻止他履行他的神圣职责。",
	"Giorge Forsworn is insane. He is a villain in his own right, but he is also a servant of an elder evil. Shothragot has a penchant for remaking mortals into useful servants, bending their bodies and minds to become fitting tools for use in its own agenda of freeing Tharizdun. Giorge, then, is an extension of the elder evil's will. He travels endlessly, moving through the lands, always watching and searching for those marked for death. He is a reluctant servant, haunted by the memories of his life before the touch of evil, and he despairs about his fate. Even the company of a {@creature Mask|EdE|beautiful nymph} is not enough to drag him from his melancholic thoughts, though she uses every trick she can to distract him from his suffering.": "乔吉-福斯沃恩是个疯子。他本身就是一个恶棍，但他也是一个长老级恶魔的仆人。Shothragot喜欢把凡人改造成有用的仆人，把他们的身体和思想改造成合适的工具，用于自己解放塔里兹敦的计划。因此，乔吉是长老邪恶意志的延伸。他无休止地旅行，在这片土地上移动，一直在观察和寻找那些被标记为死亡的人。他是一个不情愿的仆人，被他在接触邪恶之前的生活记忆所困扰，他对自己的命运感到绝望。即使有一个{@creature Mask|EdE|beautiful nymph}的陪伴，也不足以把他从忧郁的思绪中拖出来，尽管她用尽一切办法让他从痛苦中转移注意力。",
	"Regardless of his detestation for his work, he cannot stop himself. He must do as his master commands and he has no concept of sparing his victims. Therefore, in spite of his reluctance, Giorge is a foul adversary that strikes seemingly at random. In one village, he might slaughter an entire family of peasants, and in the next, he may burn down a temple of St. Cuthbert. Even he has no idea why his targets are selected. He only knows that they are.": "无论他对自己的工作有多厌恶，他都无法阻止自己。他必须按照主人的命令行事，他没有放过受害者的概念。因此，尽管他很不情愿，但乔尔格是一个可怕的对手，他似乎是随意出手的。在一个村子里，他可能会屠杀一整个农民家庭，而在下一个村子里，他可能会烧毁一座圣卡斯特伯特庙。甚至他也不知道为什么他的目标被选中。他只知道他们是。",
	"Giorge Forsworn discovered Shothragot imprisoned deep within the Undermountain. Much of his murders are confined to the city of Waterdeep above the elder evil, but Giorge has blood from all across the Sword Coast on his hands.": "乔吉-福斯沃恩发现肖特拉戈特被囚禁在地下山的深处。他的大部分谋杀案都被限制在水底城的长老邪恶之上，但乔吉的手上沾满了整个剑海岸的血。",

	"A black cyst looks like a massive black ball of darkness. Nothing mars its surface and when light falls upon it, it leaves no reflection. From its depths, it forms long ropy tentacles that flail about when angered. Outside of combat, the tentacles soften and retract, oozing back into the perfect orb of its body.": "一个黑色的囊肿看起来像一个巨大的黑色黑暗球。它的表面没有任何污点，当光线落在它身上时，它不会留下任何反射。从它的深处，它形成了长长的绳状触手，被激怒时就会四处乱晃。在战斗之外，这些触手会软化并缩回，渗入其身体的完美球体中。",

	"Black cysts are the nightmares of Tharizdun given form, and, as such, they are capricious beings, capable of unprovoked and appalling acts of violence. They seem to delight in spreading suffering and insanity wherever they go, and some even torment other creatures that bend their knee to the Dark God. Their dim intellect prevents them from forming any sort of lasting community, and their lack of need for sustenance gives them little impetus to set aside their wanton wickedness to work together overlong. This said, black cysts are famous for combining their efforts against greater enemies. It's unlikely they do so out of their own tactical sense. Likely, it is because of some missive from their master.": "黑囊肿是塔里兹敦的噩梦，因此，它们是任性的生命，能够无缘无故地采取骇人听闻的暴力行为。它们似乎乐于在所到之处传播痛苦和精神错乱，有些甚至折磨其他向黑暗之神屈膝的生物。他们昏暗的智力使他们无法形成任何形式的持久社区，而他们缺乏对生计的需求，也没有什么动力让他们放下肆意的邪恶而长期合作。这就是说，黑囊虫以联合起来对付更大的敌人而闻名。他们这样做不太可能是出于自己的战术意识。很可能是因为他们的主人给了他们一些信物。",
	"Black cysts are semi-intelligent formations that cling like cancerous tumors on the edges of Xoriat. From time to time, a few become dislodged during the plane's normal passage only to find themselves caught between realities.

	"Black cysts came to Faerûn with the shades. Native to the Shadowfell, these creatures of incomprehensible wickedness and depthless evil seek only to spread madness and despair, to reduce all living things to decay, and slowly pull the Material Plane into the Shadowfell. Luckily, the shades brought few of these abominations with them and those that have slipped from their control have been destroyed by doughty heroes, but rumors persist of more and more of these hateful creatures appearing in places beyond Anauroch.": "黑囊虫随着影子来到法鲁恩。这些原产于阴影地带的生物有着难以理解的邪恶和无尽的邪恶，它们只想传播疯狂和绝望，让所有生物都腐烂，并慢慢地将物质世界拉入阴影地带。幸运的是，影子们带来的这些可憎的东西很少，那些脱离他们控制的东西也被勇敢的英雄们消灭了，但是关于这些可憎的生物越来越多地出现在阿瑙罗克以外的地方的传言一直存在。",
