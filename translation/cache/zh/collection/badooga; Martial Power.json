For instance, you might learn a smaller amount of information if the check only fails by 1 or 2, or you might learn more information if the check succeeds by 5 or more or if you roll a 20 on the d20.": "在决定你得到多少信息时，DM可以考虑检查的成功或失败程度。例如，如果检查只失败了1或2次，你可能会学到较少的信息；如果检查成功了5次或更多，或者你在D20上掷了20分，你可能会学到更多的信息。",
	"As an action, you can target an ally you can see within 30 feet of you. The target gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) if it can see or hear you. These temporary hit points disappear at the start of your next turn.": "作为一个行动，你可以把你能看到的30英尺内的盟友作为目标。如果目标能看到或听到你，它就会获得相当于你的等级+你的魅力修正值（最小值为0）的临时打击点数。这些临时命中率会在你下一回合开始时消失。",

	"If you succeed, you can make an improvised attack using the grappled creature. If you make a melee attack, you can choose not to end the grapple if your check succeeded by 5 or more. If you make a ranged attack, its range is 5 feet, plus a number of feet equal to 5 × your Strength modifier (minimum total of 5 feet); doing so causes the target to fall {@condition prone}, but also ends the grapple.": "如果你成功了，你可以使用被抓捕的生物进行一次即兴攻击。如果你进行近战攻击，你可以选择不结束抓捕，如果你的检查成功了5或更多。如果你进行远程攻击，其范围是5英尺，再加上等于5×你力量修正值的英尺数（最小总长为5英尺）；这样做会导致目标倒下（%0%），但也会结束抓捕。",

	"If a style allows you to learn a maneuver, spell, or some other option, you make the choice for that option when you learn it as a stance, and can't swap it for a different option by simply switching to and from stance. Similarly, if a fighting style only recharges on a short or long rest or otherwise has some resource attached to it, switching to and from that stance doesn't recharge it.": "如果一种风格允许你学习一种动作、法术或其他一些选项，当你把它作为一种姿态来学习时，你就会选择这种选项，而不能通过简单地切换姿态来把它换成另一种选项。同样地，如果一种战斗风格只在短时或长时休息时充能，或以其他方式有一些资源附加在它身上，那么切换到该姿态时不会充能。",

	"For melee attacks, you can also allow attacks to cleave through creatures that aren't necessarily within the original attack's reach. For example, perhaps the original attack causes the target's corpse to fly backwards, hitting and damaging more creatures in the process. Use discretion when ruling on this, and consider requiring an attacker to expend their movement in cases that wouldn't make sense otherwise.": "对于近战攻击，你也可以允许攻击劈开那些不一定在原始攻击范围内的生物。例如，也许原始攻击会使目标的尸体向后飞去，在这个过程中击中并伤害更多的生物。在裁决时要酌情考虑，并考虑要求攻击者在没有意义的情况下消耗他们的移动。",
	"When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy they can see and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they are flanking that enemy.

A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.": "当一个生物和它的至少一个盟友与他们可以看到的敌人相邻，并且在敌人空间的两侧或角落，他们就是在侧翼攻击该敌人。当一个生物被{@condition incapacitated}、{@condition prone}、{@condition restrained}或侧翼所包围时，它就无法进行侧翼攻击。一个大型或更大的生物，只要它的空间中至少有一格或六格符合侧翼的条件，就属于侧翼。",
