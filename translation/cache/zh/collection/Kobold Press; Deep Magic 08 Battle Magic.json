	"Any fool can swing a sword. It takes a rare individual to bend the forces of magic to his or her will. Rarer still are those who combine that talent with a study of war. While raining down fire and lightning can decimate an enemy's forces, even more damage can be done to a foe by a well-placed defensive structure, the quick movement of allies, or a curse that impedes the enemy's will to fight. Battle magic is not just about killing your enemy; its true power is in controlling the flow of a conflict so that the spellcaster's allies can seize the moment and win the day.": "任何傻瓜都可以挥舞剑。需要一个罕见的人将魔法的力量转化为他或她的意志。更为罕见的是那些将这种天赋与对战争的研究相结合的人。虽然降下火焰和闪电可以摧毁敌人的部队，但通过精心布置的防御结构、盟友的快速移动或阻碍敌人战斗意志的诅咒，甚至可以对敌人造成更大的伤害。战斗魔法不仅仅是杀死你的敌人；其真正的力量在于控制冲突的进程，以便施法者的盟友能够抓住时机，赢得胜利。",
	"From its very beginnings, magic has been used to shift the tide of conflict, whether that's the conflict of man versus nature, man versus monster, or man versus man. Knowing a few spells is one thing; having the ability to manipulate arcane power in a multitude of ways is the real measure of might. Feats enable a battle mage to amplify his or her own effectiveness, or do the same for allies.": "从一开始，魔法就被用来改变冲突的趋势，无论是人与自然的冲突，人与怪物的冲突，还是人与人的冲突。知道一些法术是一回事；拥有以多种方式操纵奥术力量的能力才是真正的力量的衡量标准。特技使战斗法师能够放大他或她自己的效力，或为盟友做同样的事情。",

If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line and hit with your cantrip, you can either add a +5 bonus to the spell's damage roll or push the target 10 feet away from you.": "当你使用你的行动进行冲刺时，你可以通过使用你的额外行动来施放一个范围为触摸的咒语。如果你在一条直线上移动了至少10英尺，并且用你的咒语击中了目标，你可以在咒语的伤害卷上添加+5的奖励，或者将目标推离你10英尺。",

By touching a weapon and expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher as an action, the weapon becomes temporarily magical for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that does the chosen type of damage, you can choose to leave behind an elemental cloud that fills the same area as the original spell.

	"With mocking gestures, you leave the target incapable of performing at or even near its best. If the target fails an Intelligence saving throw, then for the spell's duration, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks made to direct a battle, determine tactics, or give directions or orders to other creatures. Additionally, each time the target gives commands, directions, or orders to other creatures, those creatures must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the result from their Initiative as they struggle to comprehend and implement the confusing new directions. This applies to command abilities such as the orc war chief's Battle Cry and the hobgoblin warlord's Leadership.": "通过嘲讽的手势，你让目标无法发挥或接近其最佳状态。如果目标在智力测验中失败，那么在法术持续期间，它在智力、智慧和魅力测验中处于劣势，无法指挥战斗、决定战术或向其他生物发出指示或命令。此外，每次目标向其他生物发出指令、指示或命令时，这些生物必须掷出（%0%），并从他们的主动性中减去结果，因为他们要努力理解和执行混乱的新指示。这适用于指挥能力，如兽人战争首领的战吼和地精战神的领导能力。",

	"Through this spell, you transform a miniature statuette of a keep into an actual fort. The fortification springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It is a 10-foot cube (including floor and roof). The walls are made of stone (AC 15), have 120 hit points each, and are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing a wall to 0 hit points destroys it and has a 50 percent chance to cause the roof to collapse.": "通过这个法术，你可以将一个微型的堡垒雕像变成一个真正的堡垒。堡垒在范围内的一个无人的空间里从地上冒出来。它是一个10英尺的立方体（包括地板和屋顶）。墙壁由石头制成（AC15），每面墙有120点命中率，对坏死、中毒和精神伤害免疫。将墙壁的命中率降为0会使其毁坏，并有50%的几率使屋顶坍塌。",

You can collect the raw materials before casting this spell, or you can target other creatures that have the raw materials in their possession, as long as everything needed is within the spell's range. The raw materials for the spell don't need to be the actual material a siege weapon is normally built from; they just need to be remotely like that and have a value in gold at least equal to the weapon's hit points. (For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege weapon will fashion any collection of raw material worth at least 100 gp into a mangonel, whether that's a small house, three wagons, or two heavy crossbows.) The siege weapon is limited to a maximum size of Large (no siege towers or trebuchets). The spell also creates enough ammunition for ten shots, if the siege engine uses ammunition.": "通过这个法术，你可以瞬间将原材料转化为攻城器械（详见《地下城主指南》）。你可以在施法前收集原材料，也可以以拥有原材料的其他生物为目标，只要所需的一切都在法术的范围内。咒语的原材料不需要是攻城武器通常使用的实际材料；它们只需要与攻城武器相近，并且其金币价值至少等于武器的命中点。(例如，芒格有100点命中率。瞬间攻城武器可以将任何价值至少100金币的原材料集合塑造成一个芒格，无论是一个小房子，三辆马车，还是两把重弩。） 攻城武器的最大尺寸限制为大型（没有攻城塔或风炮）。如果攻城机使用弹药的话，该法术还能制造足够的弹药，可供十次射击。",

The darkness stretches up into the sky for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling.": "你呼唤黑夜，让它提前到达。用一个尖锐的字眼，你以范围内的某一点为中心创造了一个直径60英尺的夜色圆柱。圆筒内的区域是普通的黑暗，严重地遮蔽了视线。黑暗圆柱体内的生物可以正常看到圆柱体外的照明区域。黑暗向天空延伸100英尺，或者直到它到达一个障碍物，例如天花板。",
	"This spell targets one enemy, who must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain an illusory ally that appears to make melee attacks against the targeted enemy. Your allies get advantage on melee attacks against the target thanks to the distracting effect of the illusion.

This spell has no effect on a creature that you are not riding or that your GM deems is not a mount.": "你敦促你的坐骑以更快的速度前进。直到你的下一个回合开始，你的坐骑可以作为一个额外动作冲刺或脱离。这个咒语对你没有骑乘的生物或你的GM认为不是坐骑的生物没有效果。",
	"You initiate a shockwave centered at a point you designate within range. The shockwave explodes outward through a 30-foot-radius sphere. This does no damage directly, but every creature the shockwave passes through must make a Strength saving throw.

Each successful attack does {@damage 4d6} slashing damage, and the damage is considered magical.": "这个咒语从你施法时提供的一堆微型斧头中创造出一堵摇摆的斧头墙。这堵墙填满了一个10英尺宽、10英尺高、20英尺长的矩形区域。墙壁的基本速度为50英尺，但它不能冲刺。在你的回合中，它每回合最多可以进行四次攻击，使用你的法术攻击修饰词进行攻击，攻击范围为10英尺。你指挥墙的移动和攻击是一个额外动作。如果你选择不指挥它，墙会继续执行你给它的最后一个命令。墙不能使用反应。每次成功的攻击都会造成{@damage 4d6}的砍击伤害，而且伤害被认为是神奇的。",
	"The walking wall can be attacked. It has AC 12, 200 hit points, and is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. If reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell's duration ends, the wall disappears and the 100 miniature axes fall to the ground in a tidy heap.": "步行墙可以被攻击。它有12点攻击力，200点命中率，对坏死、中毒、精神和穿刺伤害免疫。如果降低到0命中率，或者当法术持续时间结束时，墙壁会消失，100把微型斧头会整齐地掉在地上。",
	"You sense danger before it happens and call out a warning to an ally. One creature you can see and that can hear you gets advantage on an initiative check made before your next turn.": "你在危险发生之前就能感觉到它，并向一个盟友发出警告。一个你能看到并且能听到你的生物在你下一回合前进行的主动性检查中获得优势。",
	"By blowing a pinch of confetti from your cupped hand, you create a burst of air that can tear weapons out of the hands of your enemies. Each enemy within 20 feet of the point you target must make a successful Strength saving throw or drop everything held in their hands. The objects land 10 feet away from the creatures who dropped them, in a random direction.": "通过从你捏着的手吹出一撮纸屑，你会产生一阵空气，可以把敌人手中的武器撕下来。在你目标点20英尺范围内的每个敌人必须成功地进行力量储蓄，否则就会丢掉手中的所有东西。这些物品会在离掉落的生物10英尺远的地方落地，方向随机。"
