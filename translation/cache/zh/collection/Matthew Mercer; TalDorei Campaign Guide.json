	"Welcome to Tal'Dorei, the first of (hopefully) a number of campaign guides and world books within my own crazy creation, Exandria. This world was born as a natural evolution of a homebrew one-shot game that spiraled into an ongoing campaign, and eventually the unexpected phenomenon of our live-play stream Critical Role. Never in a million years would I have ever anticipated the attention our little D&D game would acquire, let alone the extensive level of world building I would put into creating and fleshing out this realm from within my own imagination.": "欢迎来到Tal'Dorei，这是我自己疯狂创作的Exandria中的第一本活动指南和世界书（希望如此）。这个世界的诞生是由一个自制的单人游戏自然演变而来，它逐渐演变成一个持续的活动，并最终形成了我们的现场游戏流《关键角色》的意外现象。在一百万年里，我从来没有预料到我们的小D&D游戏会获得如此多的关注，更不用说我为创造和充实这个来自我自己想象的领域而投入的大量世界建设了。",
	"Exandria is a true labor of love, a gift for my players, and a gift to our community. When the opportunity arose to take my scrawlings and notes and put them down in a comprehensive tome for others to enjoy and manifest their own stories within, the wonderful and daunting idea immediately filled me with inspiration and determination to produce something I hoped would be worth your time and appreciation.": "埃克桑德里亚》是一个真正的爱的结晶，是给我的玩家的礼物，也是给我们社区的礼物。当有机会把我的涂鸦和笔记写成一本全面的巨著，供他人欣赏和体现他们自己的故事时，这个美妙而令人生畏的想法立即让我充满了灵感和决心，我希望能制作出值得你们花时间和欣赏的东西。",
	"I have never written anything like this before. The process has been a delightfully challenging and rewarding experience throughout, and I have my talented allies in its creation to thank. I now stand at the end of my journey of putting this unique, personal, and colorful world onto paper from within my head, and I am extremely proud of what we've done... and I sincerely hope you feel the same.": "我以前从未写过这样的东西。这个过程自始至终都是一个令人愉快的挑战和有益的经历，我得感谢创作过程中我的天才盟友。我现在站在我的旅程的终点，把这个独特的、个人的、丰富多彩的世界从我的头脑中写到纸上，我为我们所做的一切感到非常自豪......我真诚地希望你也有同样的感觉。",
	"Within these pages lie the tools to create, introduce, and run your own adventures within the continent of Tal'Dorei, either before, during, or after the adventures of Vox Machina. You will learn about the history of the realm, the figures who guide it, and the powers which may invoke and alter the paths of the next wave of heroes you summon within.": "在这些页面中，你可以在《Vox Machina》的冒险之前、期间或之后，在Tal'Dorei大陆上创建、介绍和运行自己的冒险。你将了解这个王国的历史，指导它的人物，以及可能唤起和改变你在其中召唤的下一波英雄之路的力量。",
	"I offer you the necessary materials to create legends, and I hope you enjoy bringing them to life.": "我为你提供创造传说的必要材料，我希望你喜欢把它们变成现实。",
	"From the noble leaders of society who guide the political future of Emon, to the simple farmers who harvest their dinner, everyone has their own ideas about the origins of Tal'Dorei and the entire world. Many are jumbled misunderstandings of myths passed from father to daughter, or religious rewritings of historical texts that favor the teachings of a chosen divinity. Others remain focused on the few existing truths, digging beneath the layers of dust and decay that hide battles long past, texts long abandoned, and heroes long forgotten. The details are often debated, and while the common folk may live their entire lives with little care for the question of where we all came from, the question remains, consuming the curious, calling those hungry for purpose, and fueling the business of adventuring to delve into the dangerous shadows of ancient ruins.": "从指导埃蒙政治未来的社会贵族领袖，到收获晚餐的普通农民，每个人都对塔尔多雷和整个世界的起源有自己的想法。许多人对父辈传下来的神话有杂乱无章的误解，或者是对历史文本的宗教性改写，偏向于某个选定的神的教义。还有一些人仍然专注于现有的少数真相，在尘埃和腐烂的层面下挖掘，这些尘埃和腐烂掩盖了长期以来的战斗、长期被遗弃的文本和长期被遗忘的英雄。这些细节经常被争论，虽然普通人可能一辈子都不关心我们从哪里来的问题，但这个问题仍然存在，吞噬着好奇心，召唤着那些渴望目标的人，并推动着冒险事业深入到古代遗迹的危险阴影中。",
	"The following information outlines what is known within scholarly circles and historical archives, kept by the monks of the Cobalt Soul or the historians of the Alabaster Lyceum. The learned student may begin their journey with seeds of this history to explore, while others uncover its truths as they wander along their path. Regardless, we all came from somewhere, and to learn from history is to write a better destiny.": "以下信息概述了学术界和历史档案中已知的内容，由钴魂的僧侣或青石学园的历史学家保存。学识渊博的学生可能会带着这段历史的种子开始他们的旅程，而其他人则在他们的道路上徘徊时发现了其中的真相。不管怎么说，我们都来自某处，从历史中学习是为了书写更好的命运。",
	"Life ever seeks to understand its inception. Every civilization has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually convergewith history, but there is no known definitive story. Even so, the ancient city of Vasselheim in Othanzia is largely considered the oldest surviving city, having endured a terrible war that wiped out most of civilization more than a thousand years ago. Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, and the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophe. Widely accepted as the true record of the world's origins, the myth of \"The Founding\" is the interpretation held and embraced within most of Tal'Dorei, as well as the vast lands of Exandria.": "生命一直在寻求了解它的起源。每个文明都对其故事的开始有自己的解释。即使在埃克桑德里亚的世界里，不同的文化也有最终与历史交汇的创世神话，但没有已知的明确的故事。即便如此，奥坦西亚的瓦瑟海姆古城在很大程度上被认为是现存最古老的城市，它经历了一千多年前一场可怕的战争，消灭了大部分的文明。瓦塞尔海姆拥有已知最早的神庙，以及在这场灾难中幸存的最早的历史记录。被广泛接受为世界起源的真实记录，\"建国 \"的神话是大多数塔尔多雷人以及埃克桑德里亚的广大土地所持有和接受的解释。",
	"...then, the vast empty heart of endless shadow befell the light of the Seeker. Cascading from the pits was the font of life. The first moon formed the endless oceans. The second sun brought the lush soil. The third wind carried breath of life. The fourth flame ignited the Heart of Exandria.": "......然后，巨大的空心无尽的阴影降临在探索者的光芒上。从坑洞中串起的是生命之源。第一个月亮形成了无尽的海洋。第二个太阳带来了茂盛的土壤。第三道风带来了生命的气息。第四道火焰点燃了埃克桑德里亚之心。",
	"Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces. Naught but unbridled fires, and churning, sawlike rock made up its substance. Through the ashen skies of Creation Primordial, the gods came from beyond the ether, new and formless. Looking upon this roiling realm, they saw potential for great beauty, great strength, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.": "很久以前，这个世界是一个充满动荡和混乱的力量。除了肆无忌惮的火焰和汹涌澎湃的锯齿状岩石外，没有任何东西构成它的实质。通过原始创造的灰暗天空，诸神从乙醚之外来到这里，新的和无形的。观察着这一波涛汹涌的领域，他们看到了巨大的美和强大的潜力，以及了解自己在创造中的地位的机会。",
	"Thus, divine hands formed the First Children, the elves, created with physical grace reflecting the gods' own divinity, to walk the verdant lands and know the music of the blue skies. A second creation was wrought—the dwarves, a hearty people intent on taming the land, filled with the craft and invention of the divinity beyond the ashen void. A third people were given life: the humans, endowed with hearts of passion that burned as brightly as their spans of life were short, filled with the celebration and laughter of the hands creating them.": "因此，神圣的双手形成了第一批孩子--精灵，他们以反映众神自身神性的体态被创造出来，在青翠的土地上行走，了解蓝天的音乐。第二个创造是矮人，一个打算驯服土地的健壮民族，充满了灰暗虚空之外的神性的工艺和发明。第三个民族被赋予了生命：人类，被赋予了热情的心，他们的生命短暂而明亮，充满了创造他们的双手的庆祝和笑声。",
	"Other creations followed as the many races of Exandria were given form from the boundless inspiration the protean gods expressed. These Children of Creation walked the land, and as their knowledge grew they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the children were largely dashed and consumed by the elements. Sorrow filled the hearts of the gods while these first races continued to struggle against a land that did not want them. The Children looked to their creators for guidance and protection. The gods gave to them gifts, lending their own power to their children to create and shape the world around them; these were the first divine magics.": "随着埃克桑德里亚的众多种族从保护神所表达的无限灵感中被赋予形式，其他的创造也随之而来。这些创造之子在这片土地上行走，随着他们知识的增长，他们试图进行建设。但这块土地凶猛而诡谲，孩子们基本上都被元素冲垮和吞噬了。当这些最初的种族继续与这片不需要他们的土地斗争时，悲伤充满了诸神的心。孩子们向他们的创造者寻求指导和保护。诸神给了他们礼物，把自己的力量借给他们的孩子，以创造和塑造他们周围的世界；这些是最早的神圣魔法。",
	"Thus, the various peoples began to learn how to bend the angry earth to their will: to temper the fires that burst through, to tame the floods that threatened their abundance, and to foster seedling into fruit and beast into meal. Language became commonplace, culture was born, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good, yet fragile and in need of guardians.": "因此，各族人民开始学习如何使愤怒的大地屈服于他们的意志：节制突如其来的大火，驯服威胁他们丰收的洪水，并将幼苗培育成果实，将野兽培育成食物。语言变得普遍，文化诞生了，治理取代了无政府状态。保护神创造者，灰暗天空之外的神性，看到了进步，看到了它是好的，但也是脆弱的，需要守护者。",
	"So were born the First Protectors: The Dragons Metallic.": "因此诞生了第一批保护者。龙的金属性。",
	"These Protectors watched over the fairer races. The realm grew quieter, the people expanded, and new races were given form and life. As culture grew, and the people further understood the world around them, they too looked up to their Creators and gave them worship, gave them form, gave them title, and purpose.": "这些保护者看护着较公平的种族。境界越来越安静，人民越来越多，新的种族被赋予形式和生命。随着文化的发展，人们进一步了解他们周围的世界，他们也仰望他们的创造者，并给予他们崇拜，给予他们形式，给予他们称号和目的。",
	"But this realm did not wish to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance. Seas swelled and swallowed. Flames erupted from underneath the lands. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who had already taken this world as their home: the Primordials. These great Elemental Titans that once dwelt deep within the land now rose from their unseen domain to sunder the land once more. The gods watched as their children—their joy—were largely dashed against the broken rock or fed to formless terrors unleashed in the wake of the destruction. Demonic entities spilled from the umbra of the Abyss to feast on the carnage, called forth by the violence and released to pick the carrion clean.": "但这个王国并不希望被驯服。颤抖的悬崖发出蔑视的吼声。海水涌动并吞噬。火焰从土地下面喷发出来。在这些元素之下，在灰暗的天空之外的创造者们不知道，住着已经把这个世界作为他们的家的古老生命：原始人。这些曾经居住在土地深处的伟大的元素泰坦，现在从他们看不见的领域中升起，再次分裂了这片土地。诸神看着他们的孩子--他们的欢乐--大部分被砸在破碎的岩石上，或者被喂给在毁灭之后释放出来的无形的恐怖。恶魔的实体从深渊的保护罩中溢出，在这场大屠杀中大快朵颐，它们被暴力所召唤，被释放出来，将腐肉采摘干净。",
	"Some gods were so full of grief and anger they wished to abandon this world for another, trying to convince their divine kindred to join the Primordials in reclaiming the realm for chaos so they could move on to start anew.Others of the Creators wished to remain and subdue these native Primordials, to tame the land for the sake of their creation and joy. This caused a divide among the gods. Some left the family of the Creators to give into madness, joining their song and sword to that of chaos and destruction, taking and twisting their children in the image of their intent. Celestial sentinels locked into war with the chaotic forces of the Abyss fell to hate and tyranny, forging the Hells under a fallen angel now claiming lordship.": "一些神灵充满了悲伤和愤怒，他们希望放弃这个世界去寻找另一个世界，试图说服他们的神族加入原始人的行列，为混沌的世界开垦，这样他们就可以继续前进，重新开始。其他的创造者希望留下并制服这些本地原始人，为了他们的创造和快乐而驯服这片土地。这引起了众神之间的分歧。一些人离开了创造者的家族，屈服于疯狂，将他们的歌声和剑与混乱和毁灭的歌声和剑结合起来，按照他们的意图带走并扭曲他们的孩子。被锁在与深渊的混乱力量的战争中的天体哨兵陷入了仇恨和暴政，在一个堕落天使的领导下形成了地狱。",
	"The remaining Creators, wishing to salvage their home, their creations, and their realized selves, were forced to take up arms and learn new methods of protection to defend the faithful among their creations. These gods are referred to as the Prime Deities. They organized their followers and taught them how to draw from the very powers of creation: to build, to change, and to destroy, all for themselves and without the aid of divine power. Creation learned to defend itself through practices such as alchemy or by autonomously bending the very fabrics of existence, though not on the scale of the gods' works.": "剩下的创造者希望挽救他们的家园、他们的创造物和他们实现的自我，被迫拿起武器，学习新的保护方法，以保护他们创造物中的忠实者。这些神明被称为主神。他们组织了自己的追随者，教他们如何从创造物的力量中汲取营养：建造、改变和破坏，都是为了自己，不需要神力的帮助。创造物学会了通过炼金术等做法来保护自己，或者自主地弯曲存在的结构，尽管没有达到众神作品的规模。",
	"This gift was the knowledge of the first arcane magics. With these newly granted capabilities, the good children drove away their traitorous kin, banished the Betrayer Gods to their own prison-like planes, and ultimately destroyed the Primordials while scattering the chaotic elements to their own planes of existence just outside of this one. Peace finally blanketed the world for the first time since creation, and the first real civilization took root and grew into a grand city called Vasselheim. The Cradle of Creation. The Dawn City.": "这个礼物是关于第一批奥术的知识。有了这些新赋予的能力，好孩子们赶走了他们的叛徒亲属，将背叛者之神驱逐到他们自己的监狱般的位面，并最终摧毁了原始人，同时将混乱的元素分散到他们自己的位面，就在这个位面之外的存在。自创世以来，和平终于笼罩了这个世界，第一个真正的文明扎根于此，并发展成为一个宏伟的城市，称为瓦瑟海姆。创造的摇篮。黎明之城。",
	"Culture developed anew, the races ventured beyond to explore and discover their own lands, and great music filled the air to give name to this world once and for all: Exandria.": "文化得到了新的发展，各种族冒险去探索和发现他们自己的土地，伟大的音乐在空气中弥漫，为这个世界永远地命名。艾克桑德里亚。",
	"Over time, some of the peoples grew arrogant. Seeing their arcane gifts as proof the gods held no sway over their fate, some began to believe that, with enough understanding, they could become as powerful as the gods themselves. As such, many began to shun faith for their own pursuits. Though this hurt and surprised the Prime Deities, they understood the willfulness of their creation and endured out of love and hope for redemption.": "随着时间的推移，一些人变得傲慢起来。他们把自己的奥术天赋看作是诸神对他们的命运不加控制的证明，一些人开始相信，只要有足够的理解，他们就能变得和诸神一样强大。因此，许多人开始为自己的追求而回避信仰。虽然这让主神们感到痛苦和惊讶，但他们理解他们的创造物的意志力，并出于爱和救赎的希望而忍受着。",
	"Great kingdoms sprang up. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new forms of life and power.": "伟大的王国兴起了。城堡在一天之内建成，这是由奥术师新发现的力量所加速的。尽管魔法可以被用来以前所未有的速度完成最困难的任务，但魔法使用者一直在努力创新。随着法师们练习和完善他们的创造能力，他们很快就解开了生命本身的秘密，诞生了奇妙的、危险的新生命和力量形式。",
	"The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty, but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Petty squabbles erupted over resources and wealth among the elite, while the rumor of immortality through perfected arcanum began to drive the greatest mages wild with a lust for power unending. One mortal mage, her name either lost or struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making her the first and only mortal to ascend. One powerful archmage, Vespin Chloras, was inspired by this display. Driven by his hunger, he sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the betrayers into the mortal world.": "奥术的出现似乎是通往富足时代的关键，但也被证明是对它的威胁，因为繁荣很快让位于贪婪。精英们为了争夺资源和财富爆发了小规模的争吵，而通过完善的奥术而获得不朽的传言开始让最伟大的法师们疯狂地追求无尽的权力欲望。一位凡人法师，她的名字要么已经丢失，要么已经从历史中抹去，她制作了现在被禁止的仪式来挑战死亡之神，杀死了他并在万神殿中占据了他的位置，使她成为第一个也是唯一一个升天的凡人。一位强大的大法师，维斯平-克洛拉斯，受到了这次展示的启发。在饥饿的驱使下，他寻求被放逐的诸神的指导和力量，打开了他们监狱的大门，将背叛者释放到凡间。",
	"In their imprisonment, the gods of Hatred and Despair twisted their prison into their own image, spawning unthinkable horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed. The Hells and the Abyss began to push their way into Creation. The Betrayer Gods and their hateful children, unbanished and allowed re-entry into the Creation that had exiled them, discovered the world unspoiled, save for the avarice of mortals. The urge to ruin was now replaced with the desire to dominate, and the Betrayer Gods turned their sights first to the Archmage Vespin who freed them, making him their first thrall. The Betrayer Gods sought out the remnants of their offspring, scattered across the world, and created with them a mighty and terrible new kingdom on the far end of the world—Ghor Dranas.": "在他们的监禁中，仇恨和绝望之神将他们的监狱扭曲成他们自己的形象，催生出难以想象的恐怖，他们活着只是为了将和平变成痛苦，将正义变成傲慢和贪婪。地狱和深渊开始向创世之门推进。背叛者诸神和他们可恨的孩子们，没有被禁锢，被允许重新进入放逐他们的创世，发现世界没有被破坏，只有凡人的贪婪。毁灭的冲动现在被统治的欲望所取代，背叛者诸神首先把目光转向了释放他们的大法师维斯平，使他成为他们的第一个王牌。背叛者诸神寻找他们散落在世界各地的残余后代，并与他们一起在世界的远端建立了一个强大而可怕的新王国--霍尔-德拉纳斯。",
	"In this land of evil, where the twisted power of the lower planes seeped into this world, the lords of darkness tainted the minds of mortals, hungrily welcoming those who had forgotten their way home, and offering great promises and boons to hearts easily swayed. These poisonous seeds found fertile ground in the hearts of mortals obsessed with the unlimited power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the Betrayer Gods soon made their presence known to the world with an assault on Vasselheim itself.": "在这片邪恶的土地上，下层世界的扭曲力量渗入了这个世界，黑暗的领主们玷污了凡人的思想，饥渴地欢迎那些忘记了回家的人，并向容易动摇的心提供巨大的承诺和恩惠。这些有毒的种子在痴迷于奥术的无限力量的凡人心中找到了肥沃的土壤。背叛者之神在他们身后有一个被诅咒的军团，他们很快就向世界表明了他们的存在，对瓦塞尔海姆本身进行了攻击。",
	"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of the gods. The Prime Deities descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle between divinity and mortalkind, heroes and demons raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights until the dark forces, their surprise attack thwarted, were forced to retreat.": "虽然城市的大部分都变成了废墟，但由于诸神的干预，瓦塞尔海姆经受住了最初的攻击。主神降临，与他们以前的兄弟们交手。神性与凡人、英雄与恶魔之间的战斗无休止地持续了二十个昼夜，直到黑暗势力的突袭受挫，被迫退却。",
	"Evil was repulsed momentarily, but with the revelation of such a terrible foe, a dangerous arcane arms race began. Trust was shattered indefinitely: If mortals could fall under the sway of the Betrayer Gods, who was an ally? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, how were they relevant?": "邪恶暂时被击退了，但随着这样一个可怕敌人的出现，一场危险的奥术军备竞赛开始了。信任被无限期地打破了。如果凡人可以在背叛者诸神的控制下堕落，那么谁是盟友？如果像这样的毁灭可以在神性的注视下被释放出来，那么他们怎么会有关系？",
	"Not trusting any but themselves, the self-interested and singular humans beat their instruments of celebration into instruments of incredible power: artifacts that could be wielded by singular heroes. The dwarves' fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed further into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. Elves used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never seen before.": "除了他们自己之外，他们不相信任何人，自利的、单一的人类将他们的庆祝工具打造成具有难以置信的力量的工具：可以由单一的英雄挥舞的神器。矮人对岩石和泥土的迷恋转向了与世隔绝，因为他们进一步钻进了山里，利用他们的神圣天赋，使自主的巨兽军团充满活力，保护他们的祖先大厅。精灵们利用他们对造物之美的理解和错综复杂的关系，编织出具有难以想象的破坏力的法术，艾克桑德里亚从未见过这样的法术。",
	"For the first time since the Primordials, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as \"The Calamity.\"": "自原始人以来，魔法的焦点第一次变成了战争。诸神自己也同意在战场上加入他们的孩子，从天而降，再次拿起武器参加现在被称为 \"灾祸 \"的战争。",
	"No record remains of the terrible war that followed, but its effects are still felt today. The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles of gods and mortals alike was enough to fray the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world. It completely rearranged the known flow of magical ley energy across Exandria. The dark kingdom of Ghor Dranas was brought to ruin, but the conflict devastated Exandria's peoples, reducing most cities to ash, inspiring in many a desire to flee from this plane of existence entirely. So great was the loss of life during the war that historians believe no more than a third of Exandria's population survived, leaving the only remaining bastion of civilization: the Dawn City itself, Vasselheim.": "随后发生的可怕战争没有留下任何记录，但其影响至今仍可感受到。在随后的诸神和凡人的战斗中，所释放的能量之大，足以破坏阻挡元素混乱的边界，将肆无忌惮的毁灭洒向世界。它完全重新安排了整个艾克桑德里亚已知的魔法雷系能量流。古尔-德拉纳斯的黑暗王国被毁了，但这场冲突却摧毁了埃克桑德里亚的人民，使大多数城市化为灰烬，激发了许多人完全逃离这个存在平面的愿望。战争期间的生命损失如此之大，以至于历史学家认为艾克珊德里亚只有三分之一的人口幸存下来，只剩下唯一的文明堡垒：黎明之城本身，瓦塞尔海姆。",
	"The world entered a long, dark period of recovery, when history had to be recovered and purpose had to be restored. The Betrayer Gods were banished once more to their realms of deception and hate, but the threat of their return weighed heavily on the world. The Prime Deities felt that their involvement in mortal conflict was to blame for the cataclysmic damage inflicted upon Exandria. They knew that while the divine gateways were left open, the prison planes that held the banished Betrayers would remain imperfect and temporary.": "世界进入了一个漫长而黑暗的恢复期，这时历史必须被恢复，目的必须被恢复。背叛者诸神再次被放逐到他们的欺骗和仇恨的领域，但他们回来的威胁对世界造成了沉重的负担。主神们认为，他们参与了凡人的冲突，是对埃克桑德里亚造成的灾难性破坏的责任。他们知道，虽然神圣的通道是开放的，但关押被放逐的背叛者的监狱平面仍然是不完善和暂时的。",
	"Thus, in hopes of ensuring such ruin would not befall Exandria again, they left their children to fend for themselves within and beyond the walls of Vasselheim. The Prime Deities returned to their own realms, dragging both Betrayer and Abomination with them and sealing the pathways to the mortal realm behind them with the Divine Gate. Only in this way could they prevent their corrupted brethren from physically returning to the material plane. Sadly, for the Prime Deities, this action also carried with it a self-imposed sentence of exile. They would henceforth never be allowed to visit Creation.": "因此，为了确保这样的毁灭不会再次降临到埃克桑德里亚，他们把自己的孩子留在了瓦塞尔海姆城墙内外自生自灭。主神们回到了自己的领域，拖着背叛者和憎恶，用神门封住了他们身后通往凡间的通道。只有这样，他们才能阻止他们被腐蚀的兄弟们实际返回物质界。可悲的是，对于主神们来说，这一行动也带来了一个自我放逐的判决。从此，他们将永远不被允许访问创世。",
	"The disappearance of the gods is known by many names: \"The Second Spark\" for those who study the arcane; \"The Penance\" for those who seek closeness to their gods; but the most common name for this time of warfare and separation is \"The Divergence,\" and it marked the end of the Age of Arcanum.": "众神的消失有很多名字。对于研究奥术的人来说是 \"第二火花\"；对于那些寻求与神灵亲近的人来说是 \"忏悔\"；但对于这段战乱和分离的时期，最常见的名字是 \"分歧\"，它标志着奥术时代的结束。",
	"Much time has passed since, and the world has been reborn once again. The gods still exhibit their influence and guidance from beyond the Divine Gate, bestowing their knowledge and power to their most devout worshippers, but the path of mortals is now their own to make. New cities, kingdoms, and cultures have retaken the world, built over the ashes of the old. New songs fill the air, and the hope of a brighter future drives people day after day, while buried ruins and forgotten relics remind all people of a darker time of mistakes that should never be repeated.": "时间过去了很久，世界再次获得了重生。诸神仍然从神门之外展示他们的影响和指导，将他们的知识和力量赐予他们最虔诚的崇拜者，但凡人的道路现在是他们自己的。新的城市、王国和文化已经重新占领了世界，建立在旧的灰烬之上。新的歌曲充斥着空气，对更光明的未来的希望日复一日地驱使着人们，而被埋葬的废墟和被遗忘的遗物则提醒所有的人，一个更黑暗的时代的错误永远不应该被重复。",
	"Following the creation, and subsequent razing, of Exandria, a post-Divergence world was now left to rise from the ashes and begin a new era. While every region has had their own rebirth since the terrible destruction of the Calamity, the continent that now bears the name of this setting shall remain the focus. Let it begin with the founding of Gwessar.": "在艾克桑德里亚被创建并随后被夷为平地之后，一个分歧后的世界被留在了灰烬中，开始了新的时代。虽然自灾难的可怕破坏以来，每个地区都有自己的重生，但现在以这个设定为名的大陆仍将是重点。让我们从格维萨的建立开始。",
	"Not more than 800 years ago, what is now known as the continent of Tal'Dorei housed the germinating seeds of restored civilization. It was the hardy, dependable dwarves who best weathered the war between gods and mortals, and within the Cliffkeep Mountains, the dwarven clans built the subterranean city of Kraghammer. The proud clans were the first to reclaim the riches of the earth, and nestled in its safe embrace they founded expansive mines of rich metals and minerals, ensuring a prosperous foothold under the banner of the ruling Clan Jaggenstrike.": "不超过800年前，现在被称为塔尔多雷大陆的地方孕育着恢复文明的萌芽种子。坚韧、可靠的矮人最能经受住诸神与凡人之间的战争，在克利夫普山脉中，矮人部族建立了地下城市克拉格默。骄傲的氏族是第一个开垦大地财富的人，他们依偎在大地的安全怀抱中，建立了丰富的金属和矿物的广阔矿场，确保在统治者Jaggenstrike氏族的旗帜下拥有繁荣的立足点。",
	"Far to the south of Kraghammer lived the elves. In the wake of the Calamity, the surviving found shelter in the otherworldly peace of the Feywild, returning a generation later, united under the guidance of an elven sorceress named Yenlara. The elves rallied to her both for her defiant strength and her compassion in the face of adversity. It was under Yenlara's wise rule that elven society once again began to reform. She led her people westward to the Verdant Expanse, an untamed forest born from the surging, post-Calamity energies left untouched by the Betrayers' evil. Calling themselves wood elves, Yenlara's people began to construct a new home for elven culture in these lands. This reborn home was given the name Syngorn.": "在克拉格莫的南部，住着一群精灵。在灾难过后，幸存的精灵们在另一个世界的和平中找到了庇护所，一代人之后返回，在一位名叫燕拉拉的精灵女巫的指导下团结起来。精灵们团结在她身边，既因为她不畏艰险的力量，也因为她面对逆境时的同情心。正是在燕拉拉的英明统治下，精灵社会再次开始改革。她带领她的人民向西来到了绿野仙踪，这是一片未被驯服的森林，它诞生于卡拉麦斯之后的澎湃能量，未被背叛者的邪恶所触及。颜拉拉的人民自称为木精灵，开始在这些土地上为精灵文化建造一个新的家园。这个重生的家园被命名为Syngorn。",
	"The new elven society came to call this land Gwessar—in their tongue, the Fields of Joy—and they refer to the continent of Tal'Dorei by that name to this day.": "新的精灵社会将这片土地称为格威萨--用他们的语言来说，就是欢乐的田野--他们至今都用这个名字来称呼塔尔多雷大陆。",
	"The dwarves and elves are long-lived people, and when they struggled to rebuild their civilizations, there were those among them who still remembered the world that was. The humans were not so fortunate. Their histories, written by warmongers in fading ink on waterlogged parchment and vellum, did not survive the years. Yet humanity endured. Several centuries after the Jaggenstrike dwarves began this period of renewal, a clan of humans braved the angry Ozmit Sea and sailed to what is now western Tal'Dorei from distant Issylra.": "矮人和精灵是长寿的民族，当他们挣扎着重建他们的文明时，他们中有些人仍然记得过去的世界。人类就没有这么幸运了。他们的历史是由战争贩子用褪色的墨水写在积水的羊皮纸和牛皮纸上的，没有经得起岁月的考验。然而，人类却经受住了考验。在Jaggenstrike矮人开始这段复兴时期的几个世纪后，一族人类冒着愤怒的Ozmit海，从遥远的Issylra航行到现在的Tal'Dorei西部。",
	"These people had the sea in their blood, and sailed from island to island for generations, but something called them to Tal'Dorei. The ruins of their first settlement still stands today: the port city of O'Noa. From O'Noa the seafarers expanded outward, until all the western shores fell under their banner. In the North, they found fertile fields unsalted by the nearby sea against an inlet unmarred by looming rocks and dangerous reefs, and they began to build. They did not know their city would become the heart of a great empire. They did not know the glory and sorrow that would surround their city of Emon.": "这些人的血液中流淌着大海的气息，他们世世代代从一个岛航行到另一个岛，但有什么东西在召唤他们来到塔尔多雷。他们的第一个定居点的废墟至今仍在：港口城市奥诺亚。海员们从奥诺亚向外扩张，直到所有西海岸都在他们的旗帜下。在北方，他们发现了肥沃的田地，没有被附近的海水盐化，也没有被隆起的岩石和危险的礁石破坏的入口，于是他们开始建设。他们不知道他们的城市会成为一个伟大帝国的中心。他们不知道他们的埃蒙城将被荣耀和悲伤所包围。",
	"The rise of human colonies vexed the elves of Syngorn. Forests that had stood for centuries fell under the axes of creatures who lived only a scant few decades. These tensions did not rise to war, but the humans gnawed at peace like termites.": "人类殖民地的兴起使辛戈恩的精灵们感到烦恼。屹立了几个世纪的森林在那些只活了短短几十年的生物的斧头下消失了。这些紧张局势并没有上升到战争，但人类像白蚁一样啃噬着和平。",
	"As the first human civilization on this part of the world after the Calamity, a handful of self-entitled noble houses arose in Emon and established law and structure, but those who designed the game stacked the deck in their favor. Corruption spread through the upper echelons of Emon, and power-hungry politicians seized each new and valuable resource that was discovered in their bountiful new kingdom. They turned their citizens against each other, forcing them to fight for scraps while they hoarded the lion's share.": "作为灾变后世界上这片土地上的第一个人类文明，埃蒙出现了少数几个自以为是的贵族家族，并建立了法律和结构，但那些设计游戏的人却把牌堆得对他们有利。腐败在埃蒙的上层蔓延，渴望权力的政客们抓住了在他们富饶的新王国中发现的每一种新的有价值的资源。他们让他们的公民相互对立，迫使他们为残羹剩饭而战，而他们却囤积了大量的资源。",
	"Emon was a political war zone, and the greatest warrior of them all was a loudmouthed braggart and cunning oligarch named Warren Drassig. The chaos and mistrust in Emon allowed Drassig and his agents to seize power and transform the realm into the Kingdom of Drassig, with Warren himself as its supreme monarch. Drassig was quick to sever any remaining connections with the elves of Syngorn and make new alliances with the dwarves of Kraghammer, marrying Drassig's autocratic power with the dwarves' immense material wealth.": "埃蒙是一个政治战区，其中最伟大的战士是一个名叫沃伦-德拉西格的大嘴吹牛者和狡猾的寡头。埃蒙的混乱和不信任让德拉西格和他的代理人夺取了权力，并将这个王国变成了德拉西格王国，由沃伦本人担任其最高君主。德拉西格迅速切断了与辛戈恩的精灵们的任何剩余联系，并与克拉哈默的矮人建立了新的联盟，将德拉西格的专制权力与矮人的巨大物质财富相结合。",
	"The elves were furious, but the ambassador from Syngorn to Emon, an idealisitic grandson of the still-living Yenlara, hoped to resolve this diplomatically. Upon arrival, he was apprehended, tortured, and slain. This final act of treachery sent Syngorn into arms, and the continent erupted into a long and terrible war between Yenlara's kin and Drassig's bloodline known as the Scattered War.": "精灵们很愤怒，但从辛戈恩到埃蒙的大使，一个仍然活着的颜拉拉的理想主义孙子，希望通过外交途径解决这个问题。到达后，他被逮捕，受到折磨，并被杀害。这最后的背叛行为使辛戈恩陷入了战争，大陆上爆发了颜拉拉的亲属和德拉西格的血统之间漫长而可怕的战争，被称为 \"分散战争\"。",
	"The Scattered War lasted for thirty-two years and is colloquially known as the \"Time of Shrouds:. The war spanned throughout the Cliffkeep Mountains and into parts of the Verdant Expanse, with the human colonies spread throughout the soon-to-be-warring territories. The settlements, towns, and cities had no means of long-range communication, and could not warn each other; Drassig was able to attack each one with little resistance. He taught his soldiers to infiltrate their enemy, listening from the shadows to uncover their weaknesses, determining the best point of attack and how best to destroy the morale of any obstinate insurgents. With the groundwork complete, one of Drassig's generals would strike at the weakened masses with swiftness and savagery. Drassig's shadow tactics were uncouth, but while viewed as highly irregular and dishonorable, proved extremely effective in preventing widespread uprising.": "分散战争持续了三十二年，被俗称为 \"乌云时代\"。这场战争跨越了整个克利夫普斯山脉，并进入了绿野仙踪的部分地区，人类的殖民地分布在即将发生战争的地区。这些定居点、城镇和城市没有远程通信手段，也无法相互警告；德拉西格能够在几乎没有抵抗的情况下攻击每一个定居点。他教他的士兵潜入敌人内部，从暗处倾听以发现他们的弱点，确定最佳攻击点以及如何最好地摧毁任何顽固的叛乱分子的士气。随着基础工作的完成，德拉西格的一名将军将以迅速和野蛮的方式向弱小的群众发起攻击。德拉西格的影子战术很不讲究，但虽然被认为是非常不规范和不光彩的，但事实证明在防止广泛起义方面非常有效。",
	"Cities crumbled beneath of the shadow of Drassig's rule. The lights within settlements of humans and wood elves alike were snuffed out, and this creeping brutality lasted more than nine years. King Warren Drassig eventually sent his troops to what was believed to be the nearly abandoned village of Torthil, rumored to be a haven for refugees. Warren led his men throughout the ghost town, and they scattered about to look for survivors. As they regrouped in the town square, Warren delivered an inspiring speech on the utility of fear and shadow in worthwhile victory. It was at the height of his arrogance that the first arrow struck, followed shortly by a volley that clouded the sky. It appeared that after nine years of darkness and slaughter, Yenlara's wood elves and the rebellious humans of the scattered colonies joined forces and formed an alliance on their own accord, outside the need for civil agreements or political treaties.": "城市在德拉西格统治的阴影下崩溃了。人类和木精灵定居点内的灯光被熄灭了，这种令人毛骨悚然的暴行持续了九年多的时间。国王沃伦-德拉西格最终将他的军队派到了据说是几乎被遗弃的托希尔村，据说那里是难民的避难所。沃伦带领他的部下走遍了整个鬼城，他们四散开来寻找幸存者。当他们在镇上的广场上重新集结时，沃伦发表了一篇鼓舞人心的演讲，讲述了恐惧和阴影对胜利的作用。就在他狂妄自大的时候，第一支箭射了过来，不久之后又是一排箭，把天空都遮住了。似乎在九年的黑暗和屠杀之后，延拉拉的木精灵和分散在各殖民地的反叛人类联合起来，主动组成了联盟，不需要民间协议或政治条约。",
	"After Warren Drassig fell, his first successor and son, Neminar Dressig rose to power. Neminar shunned the brutal methods of his father, instead finding his interests in more sinister powers. He became known as \"Neminar the Black Fingered\", as his dabbling in necromancy left one arm withered and useless. However, his militarizing infernal magics and forbidden rites elevated the threat of Drassig's war machine. Neminar led his army back to the town of Torthil where his father was executed, to exact his hideous vengeance. In the town square, he piled high the corpses of the elven and human traitors to make pyres that lit the night. Torthil was burned to ash.": "沃伦-德拉西格倒台后，他的第一个继任者和儿子尼玛尔-德雷斯格上台。尼玛尔避开了他父亲的残暴手段，而是在更阴险的力量中寻找自己的兴趣。他被称为 \"黑指头的尼迈纳\"，因为他对亡灵魔法的涉猎使他的一只手臂变得枯萎和无用。然而，他的军事化的地狱魔法和禁忌仪式提升了德拉西格的战争机器的威胁。尼玛尔率领他的军队回到他父亲被处决的托希尔镇，进行他可怕的复仇。在镇上的广场上，他把精灵和人类叛徒的尸体堆得高高的，做成火堆，照亮了整个夜晚。托提尔被烧成了灰烬。",
	"By far, the darkest days of the Scattered War were during Neminar's rule. He introduced tactics and magics to fuel his soldiers beyond human limits, leaving their bodies altered and mutated by foul, dark, necromantic magics. Their minds became warped and twisted to favor mindless bloodshed and domination. Drassig's forces became the perfect weapons of war, their ranks blessed by the unholy touch of the Betrayer God known as the Strife Emperor.": "到目前为止，散兵游勇最黑暗的日子是在尼玛尔的统治时期。他引入了战术和魔法，为他的士兵提供了超出人类极限的燃料，使他们的身体被肮脏、黑暗、死灵的魔法所改变和变异。他们的思想变得扭曲，有利于无意识的流血和统治。德拉西格的部队成为完美的战争武器，他们的队伍被称为 \"纷争皇帝 \"的背叛者之神的不洁之手所祝福。",
	"In the face of such terrible power and willful tyranny, the rebellion of men and elves continued to bolster their ranks with vengeful orphans and eager heroes. One such hero who came to be instrumental in the coming conflict was called Zan Tal'Dorei. A human who rose from the harried streets of Syngorn during such dark times, Zan quickly proved to be both a mighty warrior and an inspirational leader. Rallying the broken ranks of the resistance, Zan lured Neminar and his vanguard into the mysterious brush of the Verdant Expanse, a realm where fey magic was to work in Syngorn's favor.": "面对如此可怕的权力和故意的暴政，人类和精灵的叛乱继续以复仇的孤儿和渴望的英雄来壮大他们的队伍。在即将到来的冲突中，有一位这样的英雄被称为Zan Tal'Dorei。瓒是在这样的黑暗时期从辛戈恩的繁华街道上崛起的人类，他很快就被证明是一个强大的战士和一个鼓舞人心的领袖。在集结反抗军的破碎队伍时，赞引诱尼玛尔和他的先锋队进入神秘的绿野仙踪，在这个领域里，精灵的魔法将对辛格恩有利。",
	"Having unleashed their forces upon what they thought was the Syngornian outpost known as the Shifting Keep, the illusionary magic of the locale left the army without a target, and vulnerable to ambush. The retribution of the forest merged with the weapons of Zan's warriors, striking with enough ferocity that Neminar and his blighted soldiers were crushed, signaling a shift in the tides of war. As word of Neminar's defeat and death spread, hope grew for all the oppressed peoples of the realm.": "在向他们认为是辛戈尔尼人的前哨站--\"变幻堡垒\"--释放了他们的部队后，当地的幻觉魔法使军队没有目标，容易遭到伏击。森林的报应与赞的战士们的武器融合在一起，以足够的力量击溃了尼米纳和他的瘟疫士兵，标志着战争潮流的转变。随着尼米纳的失败和死亡的消息传开，王国中所有被压迫的人民的希望都在增长。",
	"Even so, the last years of fighting were still ahead of them, for Warren's youngest son stood to take power, and was sworn to avenge his family and protect their seat of rule.": "即便如此，最后几年的战斗仍然摆在他们面前，因为沃伦的小儿子站在那里掌权，他发誓要为他的家人报仇，保护他们的统治地位。",
	"King Trist Drassig, second-born son of the despotic Warren Drassig, took the throne, envisioning the end of the Scattered War, and tasting victory on his lips. Trist was neither as brilliant nor as charismatic as his grandfather; his armies were stretched thin and his people rose up. The rebels, led by the young warrior Zan Tal'Dorei, found themselves winning one minor victory after another. Soon, King Trist's army had its back to the imposing base of the Cliffkeep Mountains north of Westruun.": "特里斯特-德拉西格国王，专制的沃伦-德拉西格的第二个儿子，登上了王位，憧憬着散兵游勇的结束，并在嘴里品尝着胜利的滋味。特里斯特既不像他的祖父那样出色，也不像他的祖父那样有魅力；他的军队捉襟见肘，他的人民起义了。叛军在年轻战士赞-塔尔多雷的领导下，发现自己赢得了一个又一个小胜利。很快，特里斯特国王的军队就背靠韦斯特鲁恩以北的克利夫普尔山的雄伟基地。",
	"Riding the tide of certain victory, Zan and her rebels, allied with the Elves of Syngorn, pursued Drassig to a valley in the Umbra Hills, but fiends fought in the ranks of their enemy. The spawn of the Betrayers had returned to the world from beyond the mountains and spilled into the battlefield like a river of nightmares. The surrounding hills ran dark with blood and ichor, and the bodies of humans and demons alike littered the battlefield. Yet, against all odds, the hero Zan ended the Drassig bloodline, and with it, the infernal pact it had made. The grass and flowers of the now-named Umbra Hills grow black and burnt as an echo of this battle, their sap coursing with the searing blood of the demons that was spilled that day.": "乘着必胜的浪潮，赞和她的叛军与辛格恩的精灵结盟，追击德拉西格到翁布拉山的一个山谷，但恶魔在他们的敌人队伍中战斗。背叛者的卵子从山外回到了这个世界，像噩梦的河流一样涌入战场。周围的山丘流淌着黑暗的血液和汁液，人类和恶魔的尸体散落在战场上。然而，尽管困难重重，英雄赞还是结束了德拉西格的血统，以及它所订立的地狱契约。现在被命名为翁布拉山的草和花都长得又黑又焦，作为这场战斗的回声，它们的汁液中流淌着那天被洒下的恶魔的灼热血液。",
	"Society had all but collapsed during the war. The leaders of the Verdant Expanse assembled a council of trusted and proven minds, but the people were accustomed to a singular leader, a king. The council nominated the war hero Zan Tal'Dorei to take the seat, and she humbly accepted, but rejected the title of King or Queen, instead wishing to be addressed as Sovereign if a title was required.": "在战争期间，社会几乎崩溃了。绿野仙踪的领导人召集了一个由值得信赖和经过考验的人组成的议会，但人们习惯于一个单一的领导人，即国王。议会提名战争英雄赞-塔尔多雷坐上这个位置，她谦虚地接受了，但拒绝了国王或女王的头衔，而是希望在需要头衔时被称为君主。",
	"Despite Zan's protests, the council unanimously agreed the realm should be renamed \"Tal'Dorei.\" With power divided amongst the Sovereign and the council, Emon's leaders cleared their realm of most corruption and brutality. The leading clans of Kraghammer claimed they had been manipulated, and spent many years making amends, but the trust between the kingdoms was long to heal.": "尽管赞提出抗议，议会一致同意该王国应改名为 \"Tal'Dorei\"。随着权力在君主和议会之间的划分，埃蒙的领导人清除了他们王国的大部分腐败和残暴行为。克拉格莫（Kraghammer）的主要部族声称他们被操纵了，并花了很多年时间进行补偿，但王国之间的信任却久久不能愈合。",
	"A king should not stand apart from the people. A ruler should know sacrifice, for how else is he to know those who harvest our grains and wheat, who tend to the cattle, and who raise our children? A ruler should know pain and sorrow, for war is bloody and cruel, and for a ruler to ask the people to fight, is to ask them to die for the kingdom. A ruler should know justice,but also reason, for not all crimes are committed with ill intent or malice, but rather with grieving and shame. I am no ruler of this land. I am the peasant in the fields. I am the painter at his easel. I am the young soldier donned in rusted armor. You will not find me sitting upon a gemmed throne answering the questions of those in need with disdain, but working beside your mothers and fathers, fighting beside your soldiers, and aiding those wounded in the name of this kingdom.": "国王不应该与人民分开。一个统治者应该知道牺牲，因为他怎么会知道那些收割我们的谷物和小麦的人，那些照料牲畜的人，以及那些养育我们的孩子的人？一个统治者应该知道痛苦和悲伤，因为战争是血腥和残酷的，一个统治者要求人民去战斗，就是要求他们为王国而死。一个统治者应该知道正义，但也应该知道理智，因为并非所有的犯罪都是出于恶意，而是出于悲痛和羞耻。我不是这片土地的统治者。我是田里的农民。我是画架前的画家。我是身穿生锈盔甲的年轻士兵。你们不会发现我坐在镶有宝石的宝座上，不屑地回答那些需要帮助的人的问题，而是在你们的母亲和父亲身边工作，在你们的士兵身边战斗，以这个王国的名义帮助那些受伤的人。",

	"Not two years into Sovereign Zan's reign, a cataclysm struck, testing the limits of the new council. An agent from the Frostfell, the elemental plane of ice, slipped through a secret tear between the worlds housed in the forested region now known as the Frostweald. This unknown agent watched as the realm was torn and distracted by the aftermath of war. Knowing the weakened state of the denizens, this agent returned to the Frostfell to inform its master, a cruel elemental behemoth of incredible power called Errevon the Rimelord. A short time later during a celestial solstice, the peace was suddenly sundered by a rift that opened deep within that same forest, blanketing much of the surrounding land in a terrible winter of ice and snow. An army of frost giants marched through the chasm, accompanied by sentient blizzards led by the Rimelord himself, conquering all the land they could cover in snow and death.": "在赞圣主统治不到两年的时间里，一场大灾变袭来，考验着新议会的极限。一名来自冰霜之城的特工，即冰元素位面的特工，通过世界之间的秘密裂缝溜走了，该位面位于现在被称为冰霜之城的森林地区。这个不知名的特工看着这个王国被战争的后果所撕裂和分散注意力。了解到居民的虚弱状态后，这名特工回到了冰霜之城，通知它的主人，一个拥有难以置信的力量的残忍的元素巨兽，名叫 \"里梅罗\"（Errevon）。不久之后，在一个天至日期间，和平突然被同一森林深处的裂缝所打破，周围的大部分土地被覆盖在可怕的冰雪之冬中。一支由冰霜巨人组成的军队穿过裂缝，伴随着由Rimelord本人领导的有生命的暴风雪，征服了所有他们能够覆盖在雪和死亡中的土地。",
	"Many brave warriors fell beneath the weapons of the invading force, unprepared for such an onslaught so soon after a protracted war. The storm of ice widened over the course of a few years, consuming most of the mid-continent as Errevon claimed as his own all lands that fell beneath the ice. It built a great fortress of frost north of the rift and forced conquered folk to swear fealty in exchange for warmth and unfrozen water. This violent rule stood for several years before the Council of Tal'Dorei convinced Syngorn and Kraghammer to ally with them for the sake of the realm. They combined their resources to battle Errevon back to the rift from whence he came, cast him back into the Frostfell, and with the aid of the Ashari druids, sealed the rift once and for all. The snow began to melt, the fortress toppled into a basin, and the people took their freedom back from the oppressive cold. This victory is now remembered and celebrated annually as the Winter's Crest festival.": "许多勇敢的战士倒在了入侵者的武器之下，他们对旷日持久的战争之后如此之快的攻击毫无准备。冰雪风暴在几年间不断扩大，吞噬了中部大陆的大部分地区，因为厄尔尼诺声称所有落入冰雪之下的土地都是他的。它在裂缝以北建立了一个巨大的冰霜堡垒，强迫被征服的人们宣誓效忠，以换取温暖和不冻的水。在塔尔多雷议会说服辛戈恩和克拉格哈默为了王国的利益与他们结盟之前，这种暴力统治持续了数年。他们整合了他们的资源，将艾瑞文打回他来时的裂缝，将他赶回冰霜地带，并在阿沙里德鲁伊的帮助下，一劳永逸地封住裂缝。雪开始融化，堡垒倒塌成盆地，人们从压抑的寒冷中夺回了自由。这一胜利现在被铭记在心，并作为每年的 \"冬之峰 \"节进行庆祝。",
	"After many generations of peaceful rule within the city of Emon, there spread word of a shadow in the South that threatened outlying townships skirting the edges of the Council's influence. Trade caravans that hail from the Rifenmist Peninsula began to vanish, while the autonomous villages south of the Verdant Expanse sent for aid and armed protection against a \"nightmare of fire and malice.\" Sovereign Odellan Tal'Dorei felt that the economic cost of sending a regiment that far south to outsider communities without confirmation of threat was a misuse of resources. It wasn't until two years later when reports of a powerful red dragon reached the ears of the Council of Tal'Dorei that the seriousness of the situation was considered.": "在埃蒙城内经历了几代人的和平统治后，有消息称南方出现了一个阴影，威胁着议会影响力边缘的外围镇区。来自里芬米斯特半岛的贸易商队开始消失，而绿野仙踪以南的自治村则请求援助和武装保护，以抵御一场 \"火焰和恶意的噩梦\"。主权者奥德兰-塔尔多雷（Odellan Tal'Dorei）认为，在没有确认威胁的情况下向南方那么远的外来社区派遣一个军团，其经济成本是对资源的滥用。直到两年后，当一条强大的红龙的报告传到塔尔多雷议会的耳朵里时，人们才考虑到情况的严重性。",

The beast claimed dominion over the southern lands, expanding his influence through fear and tyranny. With the martial forces of the capital city of Emon unleashed out of Fort Daxio, a terrible struggle erupted south of the Stormcrest Mountains, leaving many a good soldier reduced to bone and ember. It wasn't until a band of renowned adventurers entered the fray, led by the Emon-allied arcanist, Allura Vysoren, that a lasting victory over the Cinder King was won, sealing the unstoppable wyrm within the Elemental Plane of Fire forever.

	"Sixteen years after the sealing of Thordak, daily life in the region had long returned to the normal quarrels over trade pricing and kobold infestations. It was during those sixteen years that an old and unexpected ally of Thordak's, a green dragon called Raishan, established communication from between the planes and plotted the red dragon's return. Mysteriously diseased in her later life and seeking answers to this riddle, Raishan received a promise from Thordak. Thordak would cure Raishan's malaise, should she discover how to break the red dragon's bindings, and aid in conquering all of Tal'Dorei.

	"After infiltrating the Pyrah Ashari for nearly five years, Raishan finally unlocked the seal between the planes that bound Thordak and set him free, allowing the entire circle of ancient dragons, now called the Chroma Conclave, to unleash an assault of catastrophic proportions on the great city of Emon, and the Tal'Dorei countryside. Nearly three centuries of Tal'Dorei rule in the realm ended under the rule of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, his life cut short when much of Emon was reduced to rubble.": "在潜入Pyrah Ashari近五年之后，雷山终于解开了束缚索达克的位面之间的封印，并让他获得了自由，让整个古龙圈，现在被称为Chroma Conclave，对伟大的城市埃蒙和塔尔多雷的乡村发动了灾难性的攻击。Tal'Dorei王国近三个世纪的统治在君主Uriel Tal'Dorei二世的统治下结束了，当埃蒙的大部分地区被夷为废墟时，他的生命被缩短了。",
	"The attack not only killed the Sovereign Uriel, but also scattered the Council of Tal'Dorei, throwing the realm into chaos. Thordak the Cinder King, now swollen with elemental energy, claimed all Tal'Dorei as the Conclave's domain.

Upon discovering the machinations of the real mastermind Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, with whom Vox Machina had held a tenuous alliance, they gave chase and finally slew this last standing member of the Chroma Conclave, ending dragon reign over the land and restoring rule once more to the Council of Tal'Dorei.": "一个接一个的协约国成员倒在了被称为 \"Vox Machina \"的一群不合群的战士的力量和智慧之下。这些英雄最终聚集了他们的盟友，冲进了埃蒙的首都，杀死了灰烬之王索达克，解放了人民。在发现真正的主谋 \"病态骗子 \"雷山的阴谋后，他们开始追赶，并最终杀死了这个最后的 \"卓玛协约 \"成员，结束了龙对这片土地的统治，并再次恢复了塔尔多雷理事会的统治。",
	"Only one year has passed since Vox Machina slew the Chroma Conclave, yet much of Tal'Dorei is already returning to prosperity. Major cities like Westruun and Emon are especially fortunate, for the vast amounts of wealth plundered from the dragons' ancient hoards have allowed them to hire legions of arcanists to magically restore much of what was lost. Tal'Dorei is on the road to recovery, but all is not well. The newly-formed Republic of Tal'Dorei finds itself increasingly indebted to the mages who facilitated Emon's rebirth, and there is worry that the fledgling Republic will crumble under the pressure.": "自Vox Machina杀死Chroma Conclave以来，仅过去了一年，但Tal'Dorei的大部分地区已经恢复了繁荣。像韦斯特鲁恩和埃蒙这样的主要城市尤其幸运，因为从龙的古代囤积物中掠夺的大量财富使他们能够雇用奥术师军团，用魔法恢复大部分失去的东西。塔尔多雷正走在恢复的道路上，但一切并不顺利。新成立的塔尔多雷共和国发现自己对促进埃蒙重生的法师们的亏欠越来越多，人们担心这个新生的共和国会在压力下崩溃。",
	"Beyond Emon, the landscape of Tal'Dorei has been forever scarred by the presence of the Conclave, especially the Cinder King. His hellfire left marks on Tal'Dorei that will never heal—magical wounds that bleed fire and ooze chaotic magic. Smaller cities beyond the reach of the Council have begun to succumb to sinister influences. The Betrayer Gods sense weakness within the world. The lightless madness of the Chained Oblivion churns beneath Gatshadow. The lost blade of Graz'zt the Seductive calls from the Umbra Hills for a new master. Zehir the Dark Serpent raises armies south of Syngorn. The cults of the Whispered One spread like a poison through Tal'Dorei's remote frontiers. Tal'Dorei needs heroes—and this time, Vox Machina alone will not be enough.": "在埃蒙之外，塔尔多雷的风景因协约国的存在而永远留下了伤痕，尤其是灰烬之王。他的地狱之火在塔尔多雷留下了永远无法愈合的印记--那是流淌着火焰和渗出混乱魔法的魔法伤口。议会管辖范围以外的小城市已经开始屈服于邪恶的影响。背叛者之神感觉到了这个世界的弱点。被锁住的遗忘之城的无光疯狂在盖特影城的地下汹涌。诱惑者格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）的失落之刃从翁布拉山呼唤着新的主人。黑暗之蛇泽希尔(Zehir)在辛戈恩(Syngorn)的南部组建了军队。低语者的邪教像毒药一样在塔尔多雷的偏远边境蔓延。Tal'Dorei需要英雄--这一次，仅靠Vox Machina是不够的。",
	"Tal'Dorei is not just its history—do not treat this book as an encyclopedia, or as shackles that bind you to the characters and environments presented within. As you flip through the pages to come, consider why you want to run an RPG campaign set in Tal'Dorei, and in the larger world of Exandria. What about Critical Role inspires you as a Game Master? Is it the bonds of family and love between its many characters, or are you searching this book for the secrets of its plot and the machinations of its vilest villains? Whatever the initial spark that led you here, hold tight to it as you read and search for ways to feed your personal flame of imagination. And when you are done? Create.": "塔尔多雷不仅仅是它的历史--不要把这本书当作百科全书，也不要把它当作束缚你与书中人物和环境的枷锁。当你翻阅接下来的几页时，考虑一下你为什么要在塔尔多雷和艾克桑德里亚这个更大的世界中开展RPG活动。作为一个游戏管理员，《关键角色》的哪些方面激励了你？是书中众多人物之间的家庭和爱情纽带，还是你在书中寻找情节的秘密和最邪恶的恶棍的阴谋？无论最初导致你来到这里的火花是什么，当你阅读时，请紧紧抓住它，并寻找方法来满足你个人的想象力之火。当你完成后呢？创造。",
	"The world of Exandria is steeped in familiar and accessible fantasy themes, with all the elves, dwarves, and wizards you might expect from such an RPG. This is a world new gamers will find themselves right at home in. Tal'Dorei also holds secrets that will challenge your expectations, and you may enjoy putting your own twists on these great mysteries of the world. Each of these secrets can form the backbone of an entire campaign, or can serve as flavor to create the impression of a world that is larger than just the player characters' story.": "埃克桑德里亚的世界沉浸在熟悉和容易理解的幻想主题中，有你可能期待的所有精灵、矮人和巫师的RPG。这是一个新玩家会发现自己就在其中的世界。Tal'Dorei还拥有挑战你的期望的秘密，你可能会喜欢把你自己的扭曲放在这些世界的伟大奥秘上。这些秘密中的每一个都可以构成整个战役的主干，或者可以作为风味来创造一个比玩家角色的故事更大的世界印象。",
	"Tal'Dorei was nearly destroyed when the gods fought one another in the Calamity. Now, the Betrayer Gods are sealed in otherworldly prison planes and the victorious Prime Deities have disappeared into self-exile. An unbreakable barrier stands between the mortal and immortal realms, and no deity dares breach it lest the Betrayers break from their eternal prison and wreak havoc once more. At best, a deity can only grant their clerics a small measure of their power to enact their will upon Exandria.": "当众神在灾变中相互争斗时，塔尔多雷几乎被摧毁。现在，背叛者诸神被封印在另一个世界的监狱平面中，而胜利的主神们则消失在自我放逐中。一道牢不可破的屏障矗立在凡间和仙界之间，没有任何神祗敢于突破它，以免背叛者从他们的永恒监狱中冲出来，再次造成破坏。神灵最多只能授予他们的神职人员一小部分权力，在埃克桑德里亚颁布他们的意志。",
	"However, there are several cults that wish to circumvent this barrier and summon their dark patron onto the Material Plane. Others seek to unravel the forgotten rites of ascension, thought destroyed once the Matron of Ravens stepped into the pantheon. What would happen if a mortal were to become an omnipotent deity on the other side of the Divine Gate? Would the gods of good be forced to break the Gate and unleash another Calamity upon the world?": "然而，有几个邪教组织希望绕过这个障碍，将他们的黑暗守护神召唤到物质世界。还有一些人试图解开被遗忘的升天仪式，这些仪式被认为在乌鸦之母进入万神殿后就被摧毁了。如果一个凡人在神门的另一边成为一个无所不能的神祗，会发生什么？善神会不会被迫打破神门，向世界释放另一场灾难？",
	"It was the dying decree of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II that the continent-spanning Tal'Dorei Empire be reborn as the Republic of Tal'Dorei. No more would a Sovereign rule the myriad peoples of this land, but instead the wise Council of Tal'Dorei would enact the will of the people and protect them from the dangers of the world. But things don't always go according to plan. The nascent Republic of Tal'Dorei is suffering growing pains, and unless some politically-minded player characters can help, the realm may fall into anarchy and chaos.": "这是君主Uriel Tal'Dorei二世的临终命令，横跨大陆的Tal'Dorei帝国将重生为Tal'Dorei共和国。不再有君主统治这片土地上的无数人民，取而代之的是智慧的塔尔多雷议会将颁布人民的意愿，保护他们免受世界的危险。但事情并不总是按计划进行。新生的塔尔多雷共和国正在遭受成长的痛苦，除非一些有政治头脑的玩家角色能够提供帮助，否则这个王国可能会陷入无政府状态和混乱之中。",
	"While fantasy politics aren't every gamer's cup of tea, the ills of the fledgling republic can serve several purposes. Players looking for fantasy intrigue can meddle in the internal politics of the city of Emon and root out corruption within the Council, from the influence of the nefarious Clasp and Myriad syndicates, to the blackmail of a few shadowy mages within the Alabaster Lyceum. Game Masters can also use this political element to flavor their otherwise action-focused games. On a small scale, corrupt margraves may hire bandits to pillage their own villages, requiring the PCs to step in. On a large scale, the imminent collapse of the Republic of Tal'Dorei may force the PCs to stop a power-hungry Lyceum mage from taking control of the land.": "虽然幻想中的政治不是每个玩家都喜欢的，但新生的共和国的弊病可以达到几个目的。寻找奇幻阴谋的玩家可以插手埃蒙城的内部政治，铲除议会内部的腐败，从邪恶的克拉克普（Clasp）和迈瑞德（Myriad）集团的影响，到阿拉巴斯特学院（Alabaster Lyceum）内几个阴暗法师的勒索。游戏管理员也可以利用这种政治元素来为他们原本以行动为重点的游戏增添色彩。在小范围内，腐败的边缘人可能会雇佣强盗来掠夺他们自己的村庄，这就要求NPC介入。在大范围内，Tal'Dorei共和国即将崩溃，这可能会迫使NPC去阻止一个渴望权力的Lyceum法师控制这片土地。",
	"First there was the Calamity, and the palaces of the gods were devoured by the earth. Then came the wars of Drassig, and his defeat at the hands of Zan Tal'Dorei. And then came Thordak. The Cinder King and the Chroma Conclave shook the very foundations of Tal'Dorei. Thordak \"merely\" turned Emon to slag, but out of fear, panic, and malice, the flames of destruction were spread across the continent by mortal hands. Today, at the dawning of the Republic of Tal'Dorei, the ruins of three civilizations lie buried beneath your feet, and some secrets long to be unearthed.": "首先是灾变，诸神的宫殿被大地吞噬。然后是德拉西格的战争，以及他在赞塔多雷手中的失败。然后是索达克。煤渣王和卓玛协约组织动摇了塔尔多雷的根基。索达克 \"仅仅 \"把埃蒙变成了渣滓，但出于恐惧、惊慌和恶意，毁灭的火焰被凡人之手传遍了整个大陆。今天，在Tal'Dorei共和国成立之初，三个文明的废墟就埋藏在你的脚下，而一些秘密则渴望被发掘出来。",
	"Every fantasy RPG has ruins for adventurers to explore. When your campaign inevitably sends the PCs in search of a lost artifact, consider your dungeon's role in the larger history of the world. How does the origin of this ruin affect its layout, its description, and its hazards? When Vox Machina delved into an ancient ruin in the Frostweald dedicated to the God of Knowledge, they faced off against deadly traps and had to guess the name of a devious sphinx to find their reward. Adventurers seeking a relic from a part of Emon destroyed during Thordak's occupation may have to fend off restless spirits of their own countrymen while dealing with lingering traces of the Conclave's power.": "每个奇幻RPG游戏都有供冒险者探索的废墟。当你的战役不可避免地让NPC去寻找丢失的文物时，考虑你的地牢在世界的大历史中的作用。这个废墟的起源是如何影响其布局、描述和危险的？当 \"Vox Machina \"深入到霜冻森林的一个古代遗迹，供奉知识之神时，他们面对致命的陷阱，不得不猜测一个狡猾的斯芬克斯的名字来寻找他们的奖励。冒险家们在寻找一个在索达克占领期间被摧毁的埃蒙地区的遗物时，可能要抵御自己同胞的不安分的灵魂，同时还要处理协约国力量的残余痕迹。",
	"Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III—Percy, to his friends—wanted to take the secrets of his inventions to his grave, especially the deadly power of his firearms. Unfortunately, because of his now-deceased archenemy Anna Ripley, the secret of gunpowder has begun to spread across Tal'Dorei. Now, isolated groups of tinkerers both noble and unscrupulous are working to create new technologies. Some of these modern marvels will no doubt help the people of the world—but others, in the wrong hands, are sure to cause the deaths of thousands.": "珀西瓦尔-弗雷德里克斯坦-冯-穆塞尔-克洛索夫斯基-德-罗洛三世-珀西，对他的朋友来说，他想把他的发明的秘密带进坟墓，特别是他的火器的致命力量。不幸的是，由于他现在已经去世的死敌安娜-里普利，火药的秘密已经开始在整个塔尔多雷蔓延。现在，一些孤立的工匠团体，无论是高贵的还是不择手段的，都在努力创造新技术。这些现代奇迹中的一些无疑会帮助世界人民，但另一些，在错误的手中，肯定会导致成千上万的人死亡。",

	"Those known as the Betrayer Gods are the deities who strayed from the ideals of the Founding, taking to the destructive chaos of the Primordial Titans, or were taken by selfish impulses in the shadow of the early creations. Rarely do the Betrayer Gods work together, considering each other threats more than allies. This weakness allowed the Prime Deities to defeat and banish them, ending the Calamity.": "那些被称为背叛者的神是那些偏离建国理想的神，他们投身于原始泰坦的破坏性混乱之中，或者在早期造物的阴影下被自私的冲动所左右。背叛者诸神很少合作，他们认为对方的威胁多于盟友。这个弱点让主神们打败并驱逐了他们，结束了这场灾难。",
	"Over the past thousand years of civilization, eleven major peoples have left their mark on Tal'Dorei. Humans are the most populous, and their continent-spanning republic is viewed as a testament to their power and influence—though many nonhumans argue that their contributions should not be erased from the history of the Republic of Tal'Dorei. Dwarves, elves, and goliaths have lived on this continent since time immemorial, and while humans may have been the first people to publicly colonize and openly trade in Tal'Dorei, countless others have come before and more will follow in their footsteps. Today, people come from all reaches of the world to escape hardships in their home country, whether the iron rule of Wildemount, the religious imposition of Issylra, or the brutal heat of Marquet.": "在过去一千年的文明史中，有11个主要民族在塔尔多雷留下了他们的印记。人类是人口最多的民族，他们横跨大陆的共和国被视为他们力量和影响力的证明--尽管许多非人类认为，他们的贡献不应该从塔尔多雷共和国的历史中抹去。矮人、精灵和高丽人自古以来就生活在这片大陆上，虽然人类可能是第一个在塔尔多雷公开殖民和公开贸易的人，但无数其他人已经来到这里，更多的人将跟随他们的脚步。今天，人们从世界的各个角落来到这里，以逃避家乡的苦难，无论是怀尔德蒙的铁腕统治，伊塞拉的宗教强权，还是马尔凯特的残酷酷暑。",

	"The stout and proud dwarves of Exandria build insular societies, and most every dwarf in Tal'Dorei hails from Kraghammer or is descended from those who did. The mountainous stronghold still stands as the central heart of dwarven society, and many of the most celebrated heroes (and villains) of dwarvenkind hail from these fire-warmed halls. Mountain and hill dwarves alike can be found in the many cities and locales of Tal'Dorei, but only hill dwarves make a habit of staying out long, let alone making aboveground settlements of their own. If drawn to more dangerous pursuits, many dwarves turn to mercenary work, wandering the southern end of the Bladeshimmer Shoreline to scavenge lost treasures, or even beyond the Stormcrest Mountains to mark a new life outside the politics of the realm within the Mornset Countryside.": "艾克桑德里亚坚固而骄傲的矮人建立了孤立的社会，塔尔多雷的大多数矮人都来自克拉格默，或者是那些人的后代。山区据点仍然是矮人社会的核心，许多矮人最著名的英雄（和恶棍）都来自这些火热的大厅。在塔尔多雷的许多城市和地区都可以找到山地和丘陵矮人，但只有丘陵矮人有长期外出的习惯，更不用说建立自己的地面定居点了。如果被更危险的追求所吸引，许多矮人会转而从事雇佣兵工作，在布拉德西默海岸线的南端游荡，搜刮丢失的财宝，甚至在风暴峰山之外，在莫恩塞特乡下的王国政治之外标记新的生活。",
	"More than any other trait, mountain dwarves are known for their stubbornness. As the saying goes, \"the dwarves are as unmoving as the mountain they sit under.\" Beyond the simple stereotypes of brusqueness, arrogance, and pigheadedness, mountain dwarves are complex people. As the majority culture in Kraghammer, mountain dwarves are shaped by a long history of suspicion. For centuries, new peoples and new ideas in Kraghammer meant danger. They spelled the death of monarchs and incursion by dark, subterranean agents. The only time dwarves proudly opened their arms to a new people, Warren Drassig led all Tal'Dorei into the greatest war since the Age of Arcanum. In the mind of a dwarf, this suspicion is perfectly justified—though people used to the immigrant culture of Tal'Dorei may find this outlook distressingly xenophobic, and even cruel.": "比起任何其他特征，山地矮人以其顽固著称。俗话说，\"矮人就像他们所坐的山一样一动不动\"。除了简单的粗暴、傲慢和猪头的刻板印象外，山地矮人是复杂的人。作为克拉格玛尔的多数文化，山地矮人是由长期的猜疑历史塑造的。几个世纪以来，新的民族和新的思想在克拉格玛尔意味着危险。它们意味着君主的死亡和黑暗的地下特工的入侵。唯一一次矮人骄傲地向新民族敞开怀抱的时候，沃伦-德拉西格（Warren Drassig）带领所有塔尔多雷人进入了自阿卡纳姆时代以来最伟大的战争。在矮人的心目中，这种怀疑是完全合理的--尽管习惯了Tal'Dorei移民文化的人可能会发现这种观点是令人痛苦的排外主义，甚至是残忍的。",
	"Some dwarves felt confined within their subterranean halls, and sought to move their families into the open lands of the Dividing Plains. These people of the foothills abandoned their elders' teachings of caution and worry, and in exchange found new friends, new business opportunities, spiritual enlightenment, and even arcane knowledge within the human-majority cities of Emon, Kymal, and Westruun. Very few ever set foot within the Verdant Expanse, however, knowing the animosity that the elves of Syngorn hold for those born beneath the mountain. Even so, the rare expatriate dwarf has found kinship within elven homesteads, though they are never fully trusted by the Wardens.": "一些矮人觉得自己被局限在地下大厅里，并试图将他们的家人搬到分水岭平原的开阔地上。这些山脚下的人们放弃了他们长辈的谨慎和担忧的教诲，作为交换，他们在人类占多数的埃蒙、凯玛尔和韦斯特鲁恩的城市中找到了新的朋友、新的商业机会、精神启蒙，甚至是神秘的知识。然而，很少有人涉足绿野仙踪，因为他们知道辛戈恩的精灵们对出生在山下的人怀有敌意。即便如此，罕见的外籍矮人还是在精灵的家园里找到了亲情，尽管他们从未被守护者完全信任。",
	"Fires flare from the darkness and hammers ring in the deep, alerting wary travelers of the underworld to the presence of the duergar. The lightless depths beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains are the tyrannical realm of the gray dwarves, driven by a burning hatred for their kin of the mountains. One question plagues the dwarven historians of Kraghammer's House Thunderbrand about the dark dwarves: What drove them into the depths in the first place? The only time a duergar prince was captured in battle, he only managed to rasp \"The six... we are the six,\" before succumbing to his wounds. The prevailing theory among dwarven historians is that there was once a sixth noble house of Kraghammer that fled or were cast out, but the dwarven archives—the library that contains the most comprehensive histories of the North anywhere in the world—give no mention of a sixth noble house breaking off from Kraghammer.": "火焰从黑暗中燃起，锤子在深渊中响起，提醒着地下世界警惕的旅行者，提醒他们杜尔加人的存在。悬崖山下无光的深处是灰矮人的暴虐领域，他们被对山中亲属的强烈仇恨所驱使。有一个问题困扰着克拉格莫尔的雷布兰德家族的矮人历史学家，关于黑暗矮人。当初是什么驱使他们进入深渊的？唯一一次在战斗中被俘的杜尔加王子，在屈服于他的伤口之前，只设法发出了 \"六人......我们是六人 \"的声音。矮人历史学家的主流理论是，曾经有一个克拉格默的第六贵族家族逃离或被赶出，但矮人档案--包含世界上任何地方最全面的北方历史的图书馆--没有提到第六贵族家族从克拉格默分离出来。",
	"The elves were the first people of this land. They were the fey descendants who first named their homeland Gwessar, centuries before humans gave it the name Tal'Dorei. The common origin of most elves lies within the wooded lands of the Verdant Expanse, and many elves—wood elves and high elves alike—still call the great forest their home. Though the city of Syngorn is a wondrous thing, many a young elf takes to the road to see what else the world has to offer. This curiosity is considered foolish, and those who leave the comfort of Syngorn for this reason rarely return to open arms. Thankfully, the cities of the Republic of Tal'Dorei are welcoming to such wanderers, and some elven families have called these places home for many long generations.": "精灵们是这片土地上的第一批人。他们是精灵的后裔，在人类将其命名为塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei）之前的几个世纪，他们首次将自己的家园命名为格萨尔（Gwessar）。大多数精灵的共同起源在于绿野仙踪的林地，许多精灵--木精灵和高等精灵--仍然把大森林当作自己的家。虽然辛戈恩城是个奇妙的东西，但许多年轻的精灵还是上路去看看这个世界还能提供什么。这种好奇心被认为是愚蠢的，那些因为这个原因离开舒适的Syngorn的人很少有机会回来。值得庆幸的是，塔尔多雷共和国的城市很欢迎这样的流浪者，一些精灵家庭已经把这些地方当作自己的家，而且已经有好几代了。",
	"Hunting across the many Syngornian outposts, most wood elves find their survival skills keenly matched for the wilds of the forest. Wood elves have a long history of dutifully protecting their homeland, and their people make up much of the Verdant Guard that patrols Syngorn and defends the forest around it. Of the elven races, wood elves are typically more venturesome than their kin and prone to bouts of wanderlust, making them ideal adventurers. For guardelves, this manifests as a longing to be stationed in more remote garrisons, such as the Emerald Outpost. This penchant for exploration has led to the spread of wood elf civilization far beyond the Verdant Expanse.": "在许多辛戈尔尼的前哨站中狩猎，大多数木精灵发现他们的生存技能与森林的荒野非常匹配。木精灵有悠久的历史，他们尽职尽责地保护自己的家园，他们的族人组成了大部分在辛戈尔恩巡逻和保卫周围森林的维丹特卫队。在精灵种族中，木精灵通常比他们的亲属更有冒险精神，而且容易出现流浪癖，这使他们成为理想的冒险家。对于守卫自己来说，这表现为渴望驻扎在更偏远的驻扎地，比如翡翠前哨。这种探索的癖好导致了木精灵文明的传播，远远超出了绿野仙踪。",
	"South of the Stormcrest Mountains lies the massive jungle of Rifenmist, and within roost the nomadic Orroyen tribes, wandering wardens of the jungle primarily led by a bloodline of primal wood elves who embrace their animalistic nature. Rarely do these elves wander from their jungle home except to trade with the other denizens of the peninsula. But rumors speak of a rare few of these elves who leave their jungle home to see the wider world.": "暴风雪山脉以南是里芬米斯特的巨大丛林，里面栖息着游牧的奥罗伊恩部落，他们是丛林的游荡守护者，主要由拥抱动物本性的原始木精灵的血脉领导。除了与半岛上的其他居民进行交易外，这些精灵很少从他们的丛林家园游荡。但有传言说，这些精灵中很少有人会离开他们的丛林家园去看更广阔的世界。",
	"In the frigid north of the Cliffkeep Mountains, under the prismatic glow of the Moonweaver's Ribbons, are the Elvenpeaks. The city atop the spires is Lyrengorn, and the wood elves who make their home beneath Lyrengorn's pines are known best for riding through the wintry skies on wyvernback. Every year, a few people from across Tal'Dorei travel to the Elvenpeaks to watch their skyswimmers shape the mysterious northern lights.": "在峭壁山脉寒冷的北部，在织月带的棱镜光辉下，是精灵峰。在尖顶上的城市是林肯（Lyrengorn），在林肯的松树下安家的木精灵们以骑着狼牙棒穿过寒风的天空而闻名。每年都有一些来自整个塔尔多雷的人前往精灵峰，观看他们的天马行空，塑造神秘的北极光。",
	"Within the city of Syngorn itself, many high elves focus their crafts on culture and learning, weaving magics with grace and aplomb. It is understood that protection of their home is key to their continued prosperity, so many elves walk abroad to the Emerald Outpost to watch over relations with the neighboring civilizations. The high elves are so named for their innate magical knowledge; a blessing they attribute to their supreme deity, the Archeart. Many high elves become highly religious sorcerers, exploring their latent powers through their faith. Others still develop their arcane skill by seeking admission to the Alabaster Lyceum in Emon, where they can study the theory of magic in a controlled environment.": "在辛戈恩城内，许多高等精灵将他们的手艺集中在文化和学习上，以优雅和娴熟的方式编织魔法。人们知道，保护他们的家园是他们持续繁荣的关键，所以许多精灵走到国外的翡翠前哨，看管与邻近文明的关系。高等精灵因其与生俱来的魔法知识而得名；他们把这一祝福归功于他们的最高神灵--Archeart。许多高等精灵成为高度宗教化的巫师，通过他们的信仰探索他们潜在的力量。其他人则通过寻求进入埃蒙的青石学园来发展他们的奥术技能，在那里他们可以在一个受控的环境中学习魔法理论。",
	"Few elves wish to be associated with their degenerate, subterranean cousins—while many humanoids call them dark elves, the elves of Syngorn instead call them drow. In times long past, the drow were a wise, beautiful people with long, silvery hair and skin of ash. But their society grew decadent and cruel, and their leaders fell to the alluring whispers of the Betrayer God known as the Spider Queen, and they allied with their venomous mistress against the Archeart and his elves in the Calamity. When the Spider Queen was defeated, the drow were driven from the surface world and forced to rebuild their empire in the deep tunnels below the earth. But another power existed in these dark places. The whispers of Oblivion reached the ears of the drow nobility as their servitors struggled to stave away the aberrations that encircled their cities.": "很少有精灵希望与他们堕落的、地下的表亲联系在一起--虽然许多人类称他们为黑暗精灵，但辛戈恩的精灵却称他们为乌鸦。在很久以前，乌鸦是一个智慧、美丽的民族，有着银色的长发和灰烬般的皮肤。但他们的社会变得颓废而残酷，他们的领袖倒在了被称为蜘蛛女王的背叛者之神的诱人耳语下，他们与他们的毒舌女主人结盟，在灾变中对抗阿卡心和他的精灵们。当蜘蛛女王被打败后，乌鸦被赶出了地表世界，被迫在地底的深层隧道中重建他们的帝国。但在这些黑暗的地方存在着另一种力量。遗忘的低语传到了乌鸦贵族的耳朵里，因为他们的仆人正在努力抵御包围他们城市的反常现象。",
	"The dark elves are a people on the brink of destruction. Neighbors slaughter one another in the streets of their cities as they succumb to paranoia. When aberrations can take any form—or fool the mind into seeing any form—who can be trusted? Unable to stop their citizens from mass rioting, the drow elite have grown ever more authoritarian, commanding their royal guards to keep order by violently suppressing their people. Amid the chaos, the drow have begun undergoing stark physical changes. Some drow commoners have willingly offered themselves to the aberrations to end their suffering, transforming into white-eyed, shapeshifting doppelgangers. Some drow nobles have fallen entirely into devotion to the Spider Queen, and have willingly sought the Blood of the Spider Queen to become driders in her service.": "黑暗精灵是一个处于毁灭边缘的民族。邻居们在他们城市的街道上互相屠杀，因为他们屈服于偏执狂。当反常者可以采取任何形式--或者愚弄人们的头脑看到任何形式--谁能被信任？由于无法阻止其公民的大规模暴乱，乌鸦的精英们变得越来越独裁，命令他们的皇家卫队通过暴力镇压他们的人民来维持秩序。在这场混乱中，乌鸦人已经开始经历严峻的身体变化。一些鸦人平民为了结束他们的痛苦，自愿将自己献给反常者，变成了白眼、变形的二重身。一些鸦人贵族已经完全投入到对蜘蛛女王的奉献中，并自愿寻求蜘蛛女王的血液，成为为她服务的龙人。",
	"Drow rarely come to the surface, for most are too proud to return defeated to the sun-drenched lands of the Archeart, even to escape the madness of the underworld. Nevertheless, some still choose this dishonorable path. If any ever sought refuge in Syngorn, they were killed by the Verdant Guard before they reached its gates. Most dark elf refugees live in secret in the cities of Emon, Kymal, and Westruun, hoping to live the rest of their lives in peace. A sizeable group of refugees made it to the elven enclave of Lyrengorn in the northern Cliffkeep Mountains and live with the wood elves there in peace. Adventuring drow harbor a violent hatred of aberrations, and some leave the Spider Queen's faith to become paladins in service of the Dawnfather, trading their affinity to the dark for a hope in the light of the sun.": "鸦人很少来到地表，因为大多数人都太骄傲了，不愿意将被打败的人送回阳光普照的弧心之地，即使是为了逃避疯狂的冥界。尽管如此，仍有一些人选择了这条不光彩的道路。如果有人曾在辛戈恩寻求庇护，他们在到达大门之前就被绿野卫队杀死了。大多数黑暗精灵难民秘密地生活在埃蒙、基马尔和韦斯特鲁恩等城市，希望能在和平中度过余生。一批相当规模的难民来到了位于克利夫普山脉北部的精灵飞地莱恩戈恩，与那里的木精灵和平相处。冒险的乌鸦对异类怀有剧烈的仇恨，一些人离开了蜘蛛女王的信仰，成为为黎明之父服务的圣骑士，用他们对黑暗的亲和力换取对太阳之光的希望。",
	"Halflings are the hillfolk of Tal'Dorei, and have lived as farmers in the Dividing Plains and the foothills of the Cliffkeeps for many generations—some since the end of the Calamity. After surviving such harrowing times, halflings began to wish for a simpler, happier life away from such dark deeds and higher purpose. Centuries have passed, and contentment and peace have become the core of halfling culture. Wanderlust nevertheless simmers beneath many a halfling's contented demeanor, and as the empire of Drassig pushed eastward, halfling communities found themselves swept up in the evolving new age.": "半身人是Tal'Dorei的山民，作为农民在分界平原和Cliffkeeps的山脚下生活了很多代--有些是在灾变结束后就开始了。在经历了这样痛苦的时代后，半身人开始希望过上更简单、更快乐的生活，远离这种黑暗的行为和更高的目标。几个世纪过去了，满足和和平已经成为半身人文化的核心。然而，在许多半身人满足的神态下，仍有流浪的欲望，随着德拉西格帝国的东进，半身人社区发现自己被卷入了不断发展的新时代。",
	"When the Scattered War engulfed the continent, halfling society was fractured: the Stoutheart Clan supported fighting against Drassig, while the Lightfoot Clan prefered staying at home and waiting for this war to blow over. Halflings across the realm aligned themselves with one of the two clans—but in the end, even the Lightfoots supported Zan Tal'Dorei's rebellion against Trist Drassig. After the war, many halflings returned to their farms, but others began to assimilate with the human townships that now dotted the land. Adventuring halflings, regardless of their allegiance, found the need to seek their potential too strong to ignore. This has led to many an outstanding halfling hero striking out into the world and marking their place in the local history books as champions, leaders, and even notorious criminals.": "当分散的战争席卷大陆时，半身人社会出现了分裂：Stoutheart氏族支持与德拉西格作战，而Lightfoot氏族则喜欢呆在家里，等待这场战争的结束。整个王国的半身人都与两个部族中的一个结盟--但最后，即使是光脚族也支持赞-塔尔多雷对特里斯特-德拉西格的叛乱。战争结束后，许多半身人回到了他们的农场，但其他半身人开始与现在遍布这片土地的人类城镇同化。冒险的半身人，无论他们效忠于谁，都发现寻求他们的潜力的需求太强烈了，以至于无法忽视。这导致了许多杰出的半身人英雄走向世界，并在当地的历史书上留下了他们作为冠军、领袖、甚至是臭名昭著的罪犯的位置。",
	"The Mornset Countryside has become a new home for halflings who seek the older ways, though the price for this untethered life is proximity to dangerous wilds, and it's common for farmers here to be forced to take up arms and learn to defend their land fiercely.": "莫恩塞特乡村已成为寻求古老方式的半身人的新家，尽管这种无拘无束的生活的代价是接近危险的荒野，这里的农民被迫拿起武器，学会激烈地捍卫自己的土地是很常见的。",
	"The Lightfoot Clan dissolved into its many component families after the war, but the spirit of the Lightfoots still survives. They look out for number one first, and are more prone to running away from conflicts than meeting the oncoming storm with courage. Yet within the Lightfoot spirit there is a contradiction; for all their love of the comforts of home, there is a certain unquenchable hunger to explore. Most adventuring halflings are Lightfoots who have given into this compulsion.": "光脚族在战后解散为许多组成家族，但光脚族的精神仍在延续。他们首先为第一人着想，更倾向于逃避冲突而不是勇敢地迎接即将到来的风暴。然而，在光脚族的精神中，存在着一个矛盾；尽管他们热爱舒适的家园，但却有某种无法抑制的探索欲望。大多数冒险的半身人都是轻足族人，他们已经屈服于这种强迫性。",
	"The Stoutheart Clan also dissolved in the wake of the Scattered War, and its ideals and identity have not survived in the same way as the Lightfoots' have. Halflings who display the same brash personality as the Stouthearts of old are merely described as stout, and in certain communities, that is a very great honor. Even stoutness that is all bluster—like a halfling shouting \"Fight me!\" at a creature more than three times its size—is respected if it can be molded into true courage.": "坚固心氏族也在散兵游勇之后解散了，它的理想和身份并没有像光复者的那样存活下来。半身人如果表现出与过去的 \"坚固之心 \"一样的粗鲁个性，就只能被描述为 \"坚固\"，而在某些社区，这是一种非常大的荣誉。即使是那些虚张声势的粗壮，比如一个半身人对着比它大三倍以上的生物大喊 \"和我战斗！\"，如果它能被塑造成真正的勇气，也会受到尊重。",
	"Stout halflings tend to surprise humans who know of their kind from experiences with meek Lightfoot homebodies, and can be truly cunning diplomats when using this surprise to their advantage. Seeker Assum Emring, for instance, is proud to claim that his first meeting with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II shocked the sovereign so greatly he was very nearly arrested—but was offered a position on the Sovereign's staff the very next day!": "强壮的半身人往往会让那些从温顺的光脚丫子的经历中了解他们的人类感到惊讶，而且在利用这种惊讶为他们带来好处时，他们可以成为真正狡猾的外交家。例如，探索者Assum Emring自豪地宣称，他与君主Uriel Tal'Dorei II的第一次会面让君主非常震惊，他几乎被逮捕，但第二天就得到了君主的一个职位!",
	"While dwarves, elves, and halflings laid early claim to these lands by surviving the Calamity, the humans who journeyed across the Ozmit Sea from Issylra quickly created the most widespread civilization on Tal'Dorei. Diverse in skills and quick to populate, their cities rose and spread to the eastern shores, eventually growing into their strong and just nation, though their missteps along the way have often been nothing short of catastrophic. Human adventurers can hail from anywhere in Tal'Dorei, though most call the lands connected by the Silvercut Roadway their home: the Bladeshimmer Shoreline, the Dividing Plains, and the Lucidian Coast.": "虽然矮人、精灵和半身人通过在灾难中幸存下来，很早就对这些土地提出了要求，但从伊瑟拉穿越奥兹米特海的人类很快就创造了塔尔多雷最广泛的文明。他们的技能多样，人口众多，他们的城市崛起并扩展到东部海岸，最终成长为他们强大而公正的国家，尽管他们一路走来的失误往往是灾难性的。人类冒险者可以来自塔尔多雷的任何地方，不过大多数人都把银切大道连接的土地当作自己的家：布拉德西默海岸线、分界平原和卢西迪安海岸。",
	"Humans living along the Silvercut provide the infrastructure for trade across the continent, and as such are often involved in some form of craft, business, or production. Should they be more industrious with their pursuits, the capital city of Emon is a chaotic, multicultural hub of potential greatness. Due to the open trade routes between Issylra, Marquet, and Tal'Dorei, humans often relocate between the lands in search of their fortune, so there is quite a variety of cultural background among such large cities. Beyond the cities, dozens of human-made outposts lie on the fringe of the wilderness. Outlanders, explorers, and hermits take refuge here from the hectic day-to-day of city life, but still find danger enough in the wilderness to keep them on their toes.": "生活在银切河沿岸的人类为整个大陆的贸易提供了基础设施，因此，他们经常参与某种形式的工艺、商业或生产。如果他们对自己的追求更加勤奋，埃蒙的首都是一个混乱的、多文化的潜在伟大中心。由于伊塞拉、马奎特和塔尔多雷之间开放的贸易路线，人类经常在这些土地之间迁移以寻找他们的财富，所以在这样的大城市中存在着相当多的文化背景。在城市之外，还有几十个人类制造的前哨基地位于荒野的边缘。外地人、探险家和隐士在这里躲避城市生活的忙碌，但仍然发现荒野中的危险足以让他们保持警惕。",
	"Dragonborn of Exandria have lived in near isolation for ages, keeping to the lands of Wildemount to guard their culture, their secrets, and their rites from the opportunistic human kingdoms that rule most of that land. Yet, following the rise of Tal'Dorei, the new sovereign extended the open hand of diplomacy to the small nation of Draconia, and dragonborn were transformed from a myth to a people one could see every day walking the streets of Emon. All dragonborn, draconian and ravenite alike, can be of any scale color.": "埃克桑德里亚的龙族长期以来一直生活在与世隔绝的环境中，他们守卫着自己的文化、自己的秘密和自己的仪式，不受统治该地大部分地区的机会主义人类王国的影响。然而，随着塔尔多雷的崛起，新的君主向德拉科尼亚这个小国伸出了外交之手，龙裔也从一个神话变成了一个每天都能在埃蒙的街道上看到的民族。所有的龙裔，不管是龙人还是乌鸦，都可以是任何比例的颜色。",
	"The Draconian dragonborn stemmed from a bloodline that developed a tail at birth. Claiming stronger traits and finer intelligence, they enslaved their tailless \"ravenite\" brethren, and kept them in servitude within Draconia and below, working the mines and caves of the Dreemoth Ravine. Untrusting of outsiders by nature, Draconian citizens held an aloof and elitist air throughout their interactions with the other races of the world, and attempts to build an alliance were stymied by pride and misunderstanding until the destruction of Draconia at the hand of the Chroma Conclave. Surviving draconians have since scattered across the world, many still in shock over the loss of their homeland and trying to acclimate to a world where they have no social standing.": "德拉科尼亚的龙裔来自一个出生时就长出尾巴的血统。他们声称自己有更强的特质和更高的智力，奴役他们的无尾 \"乌鸦 \"兄弟，并让他们在德拉科尼亚和下面的德雷莫斯峡谷的矿场和洞穴里工作。德拉科尼亚人天生不信任外人，在与世界上其他种族的交往中，他们一直保持着一种冷漠和精英的气质，而建立联盟的尝试也因骄傲和误解而受阻，直到德拉科尼亚在卓玛协约国的手中被摧毁。幸存的龙人此后分散在世界各地，许多人仍然对失去家园感到震惊，并试图适应一个他们没有社会地位的世界。",
	"The Chroma Conclave's destruction of Draconia allowed the ravenites to break the bonds of abuse and slavery, allowing them to set out upon the path to self-determination. Many ravenites now venture into the world with eyes filled with wonder, wishing to see all there is to see beyond the rock and chains that marked much of their existence. Few ravenites can resist jeering at their old oppressors when they meet, and the draconians must decide how they will respond: with grace and the spirit of reconciliation, or with resentment and bile": "卓玛协约国对德拉科尼亚的毁灭使乌鸦人打破了虐待和奴役的束缚，使他们走上了自决的道路。许多乌鸦人现在带着充满惊奇的眼睛冒险进入这个世界，希望看到在他们生存的大部分时间里标志着岩石和锁链之外的一切。当他们相遇时，很少有乌鸦人能够抵制对他们的旧压迫者的嘲笑，而龙人必须决定他们将如何回应：是以优雅和和解的精神，还是以怨恨和憎恶。",
	"Should your character be born from the toil and history of the Ravenite clans, make these adjustments in place of the base Dragonborn traits. Age, Alignment, and Size remain the same as base dragonborn:": "如果你的角色是从拉文特家族的劳作和历史中诞生的，请用这些调整来代替基本的龙裔特征。年龄、结盟和体型与基础龙裔相同。",

	"Gnomes and gnomish culture are relatively uncommon in Tal'Dorei. Although humans and rock gnomes both hail from Issylra, most gnomes never had the chance or desire to leave their homeland. Some did migrate over during the Age of Arcanum and endured the Calamity within the deep caverns of the Cliffkeep Mountains, rebuilding their home for a time as the rock gnome village of Wittebak. Others traveled into the Dividing Plains and found a home among the eastward-bound pioneers. Their short stature has always proved a social hindrance in the lands of the tall folk. While gnomes fight for respect within human communities, they can prove themselves through deeds, or humor, among their taller neighbors.": "地精和地精文化在Tal'Dorei是相对不常见的。虽然人类和岩石地精都来自伊塞拉，但大多数地精都没有机会或不愿意离开他们的家园。有些人确实在阿卡纳姆时代迁移过来，并在克利夫普山脉的深洞中忍受了灾难，在一段时间内重建了他们的家园，成为岩石地精的维特巴克村。其他人则进入分水岭平原，在向东行驶的拓荒者中找到了家。他们矮小的身材在高大的民族的土地上一直被证明是一种社会障碍。虽然地精在人类社区中争取到了尊重，但他们可以在高大的邻居中通过行动或幽默来证明自己。",
	"Rock gnomes prize cleverness over all other traits, and their cultural desire to explain natural phenomena culminated in the gnomish city of Wittebak—the most technologically advanced city in Tal'Dorei. Yet it did not last. Wittebak was destroyed by giants centuries ago, and the rock gnomes fled across the Cliffkeep Mountains in search of sanctuary. Many refugees found homes in Kraghammer, and are striving to recreate the centuries of innovation lost in the destruction of Wittebak. Kymal has also become a center of rock gnome population, and many enjoy figuring out clever ways to rig its many gambling halls, or practice applying new pocket-picking techniques on their occasional wealthy patrons.": "岩石地精把聪明才智看得比其他所有特征都重要，他们对解释自然现象的文化渴望在地精城市维特巴克达到了顶峰--这是Tal'Dorei技术最先进的城市。然而，它并没有持续下去。维特巴克在几个世纪前被巨人摧毁了，岩石地精们逃过了克利夫普山脉，寻找庇护所。许多难民在克拉哈默找到了家，并且正在努力重新创造在维特巴克毁灭中失去的几个世纪的创新。凯末尔也成为了岩精人口的中心，许多人喜欢想出巧妙的方法来操纵这里的许多赌博厅，或者在他们偶尔的富人顾客身上练习应用新的掏钱技巧。",
	"Forest gnomes are not native to Tal'Dorei, but unlike rock gnomes, they are believed to hail from the Feywild, much like the elves. A half-dozen small forest gnome communities exist within the Verdant Expanse, hidden from the prying eyes of elves and human explorers. Forest gnomes are more than happy to help their rock gnomish kin in their search to understand how nature works and how to manipulate it. Knowledge is not as important as wisdom in forest gnome culture, but they are keenly aware that the rock gnomes' science can protect the natural world in ways that they could not.": "森林地精不是塔尔多雷的原住民，但与岩石地精不同的是，他们被认为是来自仙境，就像精灵们一样。半打小型森林地精社区存在于绿野仙踪中，隐藏在精灵和人类探险家的窥视之下。森林地精非常乐意帮助他们的岩石地精亲属，帮助他们了解大自然的运作方式和如何操纵它。在森林地精文化中，知识并不像智慧那样重要，但他们敏锐地意识到，岩石地精的科学能以他们无法做到的方式保护自然世界。",
	"Not all forest gnomes are as close to their fey identity as those of the Verdant Expanse. Some more worldly clans have spread to other forests across Tal'Dorei. Most notably, the Trickfoot clan has made the the Bramblewood outside of Westruun their home for generations, along with several other families. These distant clans are more practical than their fey kin and less uptight than their distant, rocky cousins, giving them a curious personality perfect for the life of a traveling adventurer.": "并非所有的森林地精都像绿野仙踪的地精那样接近于他们的精灵身份。一些更为世俗的部族已经扩散到整个Tal'Dorei的其他森林。最值得注意的是，特里克福特（Trickfoot）氏族和其他几个家族世代以韦斯特鲁恩（Westruun）外的布兰布尔森林为家。这些遥远的部族比他们的费伊族亲属更实际，也不像他们遥远的岩石表亲那样拘谨，使他们具有好奇的个性，非常适合旅行冒险家的生活。",
	"Most folk of giant blood ignore the political nonsense of the smaller folk. As the old goliath saying goes: \"Only people with little strength like to talk.\" Goliaths are of giant ancestry—however distantly—and keep many of the old stone giant traditions. As goliaths keep no written history, it's unclear why they are so small compared to their massive stone giant cousins, but it is undeniable that the two races are somehow related.": "大多数具有巨人血统的民间人士都不理会小民的政治胡闹。正如古老的歌利亚谚语所说： \"只有力气小的人才喜欢说话。\" 歌利亚人是巨人的祖先--无论多么遥远--并保持着许多古老的石巨人传统。由于歌利亚人没有保留书面历史，所以不清楚为什么他们与他们庞大的石巨人表亲相比如此渺小，但不可否认的是，这两个种族有某种程度的关系。",
	"Living in small, solitary villages along the Cliffkeep and Stormcrest mountain ranges, goliath communities maintain an advanced hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Some have ventured down into the Dividing Plains to roam as nomadic raiders, taking what they wish from the unprotected few, but the sundering of the Herd of Storms (see the {@b Gazetteer of Tal'Dorei} chapter) sent many wandering without purpose—quite a few have turned to mercenary work along the Lucidian Coast to regain their sense of belonging.": "生活在沿着Cliffkeep和Stormcrest山脉的小而孤独的村庄里，巨人社区保持着先进的狩猎-采集生活方式。一些人曾冒险进入分水岭平原，作为游牧突击队员游荡，从没有受到保护的少数人那里夺取他们想要的东西，但风暴之群的分裂（见{@b Gazetteer of Tal'Dorei}章节）使许多人毫无目的地游荡，相当多的人转而在路西德海岸从事雇佣兵工作，以重新获得他们的归属感。",
	"Others are sought for their unrivaled might and find a home in bandit clans that ravage the Ruins of O'Noa or the outskirts of Stilben. A small number of goliaths have been taken under the wing of the wealthy elite and given advanced study within Emon; some out of charity, others for these nobles' own cruel amusement.": "其他人则因为他们无与伦比的力量而被寻找，并在蹂躏奥诺亚废墟或斯蒂尔本郊区的土匪团伙中找到了家。少数的歌利亚人被富裕的精英阶层收留，并在埃蒙获得高级研究；有些是出于慈善，有些则是为了这些贵族自己的残酷娱乐。",
	"Most other people of Tal'Dorei meet goliaths not with animosity, but with curiosity. Many people of Westruun are still apprehensive about dealing with goliaths because of Kevdak and the Herd of Storms' brief occupation of their city, but they are doing their best to work through their instinctive fears.": "塔尔多雷的其他大多数人见到歌利亚人时，不是怀有敌意，而是怀有好奇心。由于凯夫达克和风暴之群对他们城市的短暂占领，韦斯特鲁恩的许多人仍然对与歌利亚人打交道心存疑虑，但他们正在尽力克服本能的恐惧。",
	"Humans adore half-elven children. To them, it is not only a great honor for a family to join their bloodline with that of an elf, but it is also a point of patriotic pride, demonstrating the strength of the bond between Syngorn and Tal'Dorei. Yet for as long as the humans of Tal'Dorei have loved their mixed-race children, the elves of Syngorn have looked on them with contempt. They are called half-breeds, halfbloods, or \"ill-born.\" They carry the shame of impurity and the mark of lessened potential by diluting their superior, magical elven blood with that of humanity. That a half-elf had no choice in the matter of their birth is irrelevant; they are reviled all the same.": "人类喜欢半精灵的孩子。对他们来说，一个家庭将自己的血统与精灵的血统结合在一起，不仅是一种巨大的荣誉，而且也是一种爱国的骄傲，显示了辛戈恩和塔尔多雷之间纽带的力量。然而，只要塔尔多雷的人类喜欢他们的混血儿，辛戈恩的精灵就会以蔑视的眼光看待他们。他们被称为混血儿、混血儿，或 \"生不逢时\"。他们带着不纯洁的耻辱和潜力降低的印记，因为他们优越、神奇的精灵血统与人类的血统相稀释。半精灵在他们的出生问题上没有选择权，这一点无关紧要；他们同样受到谩骂。",
	"Few half-elves find prominence in Syngorn. Many half-elven adventurers are wanderers not by choice, but because are driven out from the forest by their peers. These adventurers are often untrusting of others because of their trauma, especially if they were cast out at a young age.": "很少有半精灵在辛戈恩找到突出的地位。许多半精灵冒险家都不是自愿的，而是因为被他们的同龄人赶出了森林。这些冒险者往往因为他们的创伤而不信任他人，特别是如果他们在年轻时就被赶出来的话。",
	"Half-elf vagabonds typically find a home within the cities of Tal'Dorei, where acceptance and even praise for their nature is much more common. A surprising number make their home within the sunless depthsof Kraghammer, finding kinship with the dwarves in their mutual dislike of elven society. Others still settle in the free lands of the Rifenmist Peninsula, among wild folk who don't care what's in your blood, so long as you can heft a hatchet.": "半精灵流浪者通常会在塔尔多雷的城市中找到一个家，在那里他们的天性更容易被接受，甚至被赞美。令人惊讶的是，有很多人把家安在克拉格莫（Kraghammer）没有阳光的深处，在他们对精灵社会的共同厌恶中找到了与矮人的亲情。另一些人则定居在里芬米斯特半岛的自由土地上，与那些不在乎你的血统的野人在一起，只要你能拿起斧头。",
	"Humans do not care for half-orc children. In their eyes, half-orcs are ugly, stupid, and destructive by nature—and ultimately no different from their bloodthirsty orc parent. Orcs have no love for their half-human progeny, either. To an orc, a half-orc is weak, their lust for slaughter dulled by the emotions and compassion of humanity.": "人类并不关心半兽人的孩子。在他们眼里，半兽人天性丑陋、愚蠢、具有破坏性--最终与他们嗜血的兽人父母没有区别。兽人对他们的半人后代也没有爱。对兽人来说，半兽人是软弱的，他们对屠杀的欲望被人类的情感和同情心冲淡了。",

They are passionate, driven, and eager to prove themselves—and it is not uncommon for half-orcs to make trouble within the city slum or orcish chasm they call home. Living in such opposition, many half-orcs feel the urge to show their worth through action, and exemplary half-orc heroes have risen throughout history, renowned for their bravery and valor. The honor heaped upon half-orc heroes of the Scattered War and more recent conflicts has helped calm tensions in Tal'Dorei's larger and more accepting cities, but the outlying settlements still meet half-orcs with disrespect and even open violence. As such, most half-orcs beyond Emon are still found living on the outskirts of human colonies and villages.": "半兽人没有得到父母的爱，他们必须想办法在这个对他们毫不关心的世界上生存。他们有激情，有动力，渴望证明自己--半兽人在他们称之为家的城市贫民窟或兽人鸿沟里制造麻烦是很常见的。生活在这样的反对声中，许多半兽人感到有必要通过行动来显示他们的价值，历史上出现了模范的半兽人英雄，他们以勇敢和英勇而闻名。在分散战争和最近的冲突中，半兽人英雄所获得的荣誉有助于平息塔尔多雷更大和更容易接受的城市的紧张局势，但外围的定居点仍然对半兽人不尊重，甚至公开使用暴力。因此，埃蒙以外的大多数半兽人仍然生活在人类殖民地和村庄的郊区。",
	"Some half-orcs reject humanity, having seen its ugliest side. These half-orcs see both halves of their lineage as equally monstrous; one side is just better at hiding it. They wander the wilds with the primal herds of barbaric hunters, like the Rivermaw of the Dividing Plains, using their brawn to earn respect amongst their leaders. A tribe of rough-andtumble warriors called the Icewalkers patrols where the northern edge of the Cliffkeep Mountains meet the Neverfields, hunting the beasts that dwell there. And some choose to live among the orcs, hardened and desensitized by their bestial family's abuse.": "一些半兽人拒绝人类，因为他们看到了人类最丑陋的一面。这些半兽人认为他们的两半血统都是同样畸形的；其中一方只是更善于隐藏。他们与原始的野蛮猎人群一起在荒野中游荡，就像分水岭的河马一样，用他们的体力在他们的领袖中赢得尊重。一个被称为 \"冰行者\"（Icewalkers）的粗犷的战士部落在悬崖山脉的北部边缘与梦幻之地的交界处巡逻，猎杀居住在那里的野兽。还有一些人选择生活在兽人之中，他们被兽人家族的虐待弄得坚硬而麻木不仁。",

They have no civilizations of their own, and most are born of human and orc parents. Many half-orcs can go their entire lives meeting only two or three other half-orcs, and very few sire children together. Discussion of parentage is a deadly taboo and a source of great trauma among halforcs—many were born from an orcish mother who captured a human man on a raid for pleasure. A rare few, however, are told stories by their human parent about being saved by an orc during a raid and fleeing into the mountains to hide.

Primordial energy constantly flows into the world from elemental rifts across the land, and such powerful primal powers occasionally influence or alter the nature of their surroundings. This is also true of some who have spent years in proximity to such a source of power, and of those who travel the outer planes long enough to find the seed of elemental power take root within their blood. These planetouched folk now harbor the potential to give birth to genasi, people born with facets of the element that altered their parents—though genasi of the same element can also give birth to genasi children.": "艾克桑德里亚的土地上充斥着元素的力量。原始能量不断地从遍布大地的元素裂缝中流向世界，这种强大的原始力量偶尔会影响或改变周围环境的性质。一些多年来接近这种力量源泉的人也是如此，而那些在外部世界旅行足够长的时间，发现元素力量的种子在他们的血液中扎根的人也是如此。这些受行星影响的人现在有可能生下基因人，即出生时就具有改变其父母的元素的一面的人--尽管同一元素的基因人也能生下基因人的孩子。",
	"Though genasi still bear features resembling their parents' race, they have clearly become something else entirely. Their facial features are augmented with elemental traces and subtle abilities manifest with adolescence, becoming alien and something new altogether. While such people are rare within Tal'Dorei, they are most common among the Ashari due to their elemental destiny. Those who risk living among common society often are met with stares, ridicule, or dubious curiosity.": "虽然genasi的特征仍然与他们父母的种族相似，但他们显然已经完全变成了另一种东西。他们的面部特征被增强了元素的痕迹，微妙的能力随着青春期的到来而显现出来，变得异乎寻常，完全是新的东西。虽然这样的人在Tal'Dorei内部很罕见，但由于他们的元素命运，他们在Ashari人中最为常见。那些冒险生活在普通社会中的人，往往会受到注视、嘲笑或可疑的好奇心。",
	"Each of the four genasi elements have one race most commonly associated with them, though unusual combinations of parent races and genasi elements exist. The most common parents for air genasi are halflings; for earth genasi are dwarves; for fire genasi are tieflings; and for water genasi are humans.": "四个精灵元素中的每一个都有一个最常与之相关的种族，尽管存在不寻常的母体种族和精灵元素的组合。空气族最常见的父母是半身人；土族的父母是矮人；火族的父母是铁弗林；水族的父母是人类。",
	"Those who bear the mark of Hell are first met with mistrust, then curiosity—and in the more rural areas of Tal'Dorei, fear. Countless scholars have delved through thousands of years of Issylran history in search of the origin of tieflings, to little avail. The most complete extant answer is that, during the Age of Arcanum, a cabal of power- hungry Issylran warlocks consorted with dark entities, and many these unions resulted in children neither wholly human nor fiend. These children denied their ash-blackened fate and traveled across the world in hopes of defining themselves through their deeds, not their nature.": "那些带着地狱印记的人首先受到的是不信任，然后是好奇--在Tal'Dorei的更多农村地区，是恐惧。无数的学者深入研究了数千年的伊瑟兰历史，以寻找铁皮人的起源，但收效甚微。现存的最完整的答案是，在阿卡纳姆时代，一个渴望权力的伊瑟兰术士集团与黑暗实体进行了交易，许多这样的结合产生了既不完全是人类也不是恶魔的孩子。这些孩子否定了他们灰暗的命运，在世界各地旅行，希望通过他们的行为而不是他们的本性来定义自己。",
	"The first tieflings to walk on Tal'Dorei sailed from Issylra during the Age of Arcanum, fleeing religious zealots who believed their very existence was an abomination. Most tieflings in Tal'Dorei refused to fight during the Calamity—when a people have seen so much evil from all kinds of people and even the gods, a certain nihilism inevitably takes hold. In the centuries after the Divergence, tieflings who had grown weary of gods and demons rejoiced; in a way, the gods' imprisonment had freed them from their cursed past.": "第一批行走在Tal'Dorei的Tieflings在Arcanum时代从Issylra出发，逃离那些认为他们的存在是一种憎恶的宗教狂热者。塔尔多雷的大多数铁皮人在灾难期间拒绝战斗--当一个民族看到来自各种人甚至是神的那么多邪恶时，某种虚无主义不可避免地占据了上风。在分歧之后的几个世纪里，那些对神和恶魔感到厌倦的铁皮人欢欣鼓舞；在某种程度上，诸神的监禁使他们从受诅咒的过去中解脱出来。",
	"When Warren Drassig and his sons conquered the elven lands of Gwessar, the tieflings of the continent rose in near unanimous rebellion against the tyrant. They had seen his kind before, they knew his methods, and they knew others would suffer like they once did. The fear and apprehension that surrounded tieflings diminished some when the other people of Tal'Dorei fought alongside them, but the tension never fully faded. As such, most tieflings stick to the more studied and diverse cities like Emon and Westruun. Kymal and Stilben are not devoid of tieflings, and many there gleefully embrace their fiendish ancestry, finding their calling in foul deeds and shady business. The dwarves of Kraghammer generally keep tieflings at arm's length, while the denizens of Syngorn rarely leave a tiefling without watchful guard.": "当沃伦-德拉西格和他的儿子们征服了格威萨的精灵土地时，大陆上的铁皮人几乎一致起来反抗这个暴君。他们曾见过他的同类，他们知道他的方法，他们知道其他人会像他们曾经那样受苦。当Tal'Dorei的其他人与他们并肩作战时，围绕着铁皮人的恐惧和忧虑减少了一些，但紧张感从未完全消退。因此，大多数铁皮人坚持在埃蒙和韦斯特鲁恩这样的更有研究和更多样化的城市。Kymal和Stilben并非没有盗贼，那里的许多人欣然接受他们恶魔般的祖先，在肮脏的行为和阴暗的生意中找到他们的召唤。克拉格莫的矮人通常对盗贼保持距离，而辛戈恩的居民很少让盗贼没有人看守。",
	"While the dominant cultures of the continent have carved structure and law from the rough clay left beyond the Divergence, these cultures each comprise several smaller factions. Whether councils of traditionally-minded politicians striving to maintain control in a world beset by chaos and danger, or a union of opportunists ever-vigilant to reap the benefits of an exploitable populace, these factions drive and manipulate the social and political direction of Tal'Dorei. The alliances and tensions that can rise between the following societies can guide your adventurers' destiny across the spectrum of heroism and villainy.": "虽然该大陆的主导文化从分歧后留下的粗糙泥土中雕刻出了结构和法律，但这些文化都由几个较小的派别组成。无论是由具有传统思想的政治家组成的议会，努力在一个被混乱和危险所困扰的世界中保持控制，还是由时刻警惕着从可剥削的人口中获取利益的机会主义者组成的联盟，这些派别都推动和操纵着塔尔多雷的社会和政治方向。以下社会之间可能出现的联盟和紧张关系可以引导你的冒险者在英雄主义和恶棍主义的光谱中的命运。",
	"All Tal'Dorei's greatest mages fought at the Battle of the Umbra Hills. They saw the incursion of demons and devils firsthand, and were rightly terrified that the spawn of the Betrayer Gods could ever return to the world. It was clear that the Divergence did not wholly prevent supernatural evil from infringing upon the world, and the mages of Exandria must prevent future \"surprises\" of this nature. The mistakes of the Age of Arcanum must never be repeated. Considering this, Yurek Windkeeper, high enchanter of Syngorn and a well-respected arcanist, reached out to the realm's most trusted and capable mages, and together they formed a private society called the Arcana Pansophical.": "所有Tal'Dorei最伟大的法师都参加了翁布拉山之战。他们亲眼目睹了恶魔和魔鬼的入侵，并且理所当然地害怕背叛者之神的后代会重返这个世界。很明显，分歧并没有完全阻止超自然的邪恶对世界的侵害，艾克桑德里亚的法师们必须防止未来出现这种性质的 \"意外\"。阿卡纳姆时代的错误决不能重演。考虑到这一点，辛戈恩的高级魔法师和受人尊敬的奥术师尤里克-温德沃克（Yurek Windkeeper）联系了王国最值得信赖和最有能力的法师，他们一起成立了一个名为Arcana Pansophical的私人社团。",
	"The chief priority of these powerful arcane specialists is to maintain the \"Truth of Magic,\" a strict code enacted to never again allow the rampant misuse of magic seen in the Age of Arcanum. General members are referred to as \"Guides,\" while the higher circle of members who deal in judgment and oversight are called \"Makers.\" At least one member is established at each place of arcane learning.": "这些强大的奥术专家的首要任务是维护 \"魔法的真相\"，这是一个严格的准则，它的颁布是为了不再允许在阿卡纳姆时代看到的对魔法的猖獗滥用。一般成员被称为 \"指导者\"，而处理判断和监督的高级成员圈子被称为 \"制造者\"。每个学习奥术的地方都至少有一名成员。",
	"Membership is largely kept secret unless out of necessity, though the existence of the order is relatively common knowledge. Anyone found to be practicing magic is logged and checked up on routinely, as misuse of magic is grounds for arrest, judgment by the Makers, and punishment outside of the local law. Even so, their reach and oversight are not without limits, and many dark and terrible dealings manage to go unseen by the Arcana Pansophical.": "除非有必要，否则成员资格在很大程度上是保密的，尽管这个组织的存在相对来说是众所周知的。任何被发现练习魔法的人都会被记录下来，并定期检查，因为滥用魔法会被逮捕，被制造者审判，并受到当地法律之外的惩罚。即便如此，他们的影响力和监督也不是没有限制的，许多黑暗和可怕的交易都没有被Arcana Pansophical看到。",
	"The Arcana Pansophical is respected, if somewhat feared, in most human settlements. Syngorn and other elven communities see the Pansophical as allies, as the roots of the society began with Yurek within Syngorn itself. Kraghammer only respects members that are dwarves, and treat the rest with mistrust.": "阿卡纳-潘索菲克在大多数人类居住区受到尊重，甚至有些畏惧。Syngorn和其他精灵社区将Pansophical视为盟友，因为该社团的根基始于Syngorn本身的Yurek。克拉格哈默只尊重矮人成员，对其他成员则不信任。",

	"{@i Former Member, Human Archmage.} A Maker for most of his life, he grew frustrated with the politics and limitations of the order and retired to Westruun to pursue his own interests.": "{@i Former Member, Human Archmage.} 他一生中大部分时间都是制造者，他对政治和教团的局限性感到失望，并退休到韦斯特鲁恩追求自己的兴趣。",
	"The Pansophical's myriad rules on the use and misuse of magic are detailed at length in centuries of amendments to the full text of the Truth of Magic.

	"Though the study of Necromancy shall be restricted to none in the interest of magical understanding, the animation of the dead is a violation of the Truth.": "虽然出于对魔法理解的考虑，对亡灵术的研究应限制在任何一个人身上，但将死人变成动画是对真理的违背。",
	"The Arcane is a tool to be wielded for the good of the people. To use its power in the pursuit of wanton destruction or murder is a violation of the Truth.": "奥术是一种工具，可以为了人民的利益而挥舞。利用它的力量来追求肆意破坏或谋杀是对真理的违背。",
	"Though the jurisdiction of the Pansophical supersedes the power of local laws, a mage who willfully breaks the laws of the land is in violation of the Truth.": "虽然潘索菲克的管辖权取代了当地法律的权力，但一个法师如果故意违反当地法律，就是违反了真理。",
	"While the boundaries between the planes are generally strong, there are some places across Exandria where the veil is thin and occasionally sundered entirely. There are places in the world where the elemental planes bleed into the Material Plane, scarring the land with their primordial power and threatening all surrounding life. During one Celestial Solstice—a time when the planar boundaries grow weakest—elemental rifts of untold proportions burst open across Exandria. Fires and earthquakes ravaged the lands, and the people of the world struggled to combat the elemental monsters that poured forth from the rifts. The tide of elementals was eventually stemmed, but the world was gripped by fear—what would happen on the next solstice?": "虽然各位面之间的界限一般都很牢固，但在艾克桑德里亚的一些地方，界限很薄，偶尔也会被完全割裂。在这个世界上，有些地方的元素位面渗入物质位面，用它们的原始力量在土地上留下伤痕，威胁着周围所有的生命。 火灾和地震肆虐着这片土地，世界上的人们奋力对抗从裂缝中涌出的元素怪物。元素的潮水最终被阻止了，但世界被恐惧所笼罩--下一个至阴日会发生什么？",
	"In the wake of the planar disturbance, a society of druidic masters called the Ashari made a covenant to divide and form four separate tribes to seal and watch over the sources of these unleashed energies. The Pyrah Ashari left for Issylra, and the Vesrah Ashari relocated to an island cluster in the Ozmit Sea. The Terrah and Zephrah Ashari remained within Tal'Dorei near their respective elemental rifts. A dozen generations later, the Ashari still hold watch over these tumultuous locations.": "在平面扰动之后，一个被称为阿沙里的德鲁伊大师的社会订立了一个盟约，分裂并形成了四个独立的部落，以封存和监视这些被释放的能量的来源。派拉-阿什里人前往伊西拉，维西拉-阿什里人迁往奥兹米特海的一个岛屿群。特拉（Terrah）和泽弗拉（Zephrah）阿沙里（Ashari）则留在了塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei），靠近各自的元素裂缝。十几代之后，阿沙里人仍然在这些动荡不安的地方守望着。",
	"Each Ashari Tribe is tasked with guarding a tear in the planes between one of the elemental planes and Exandria.

Due to the isolated nature of each tribe, they find it necessary to maintain contact and influence with each other. Each is led by a single elemental master, a title that is passed on by blood or honor for generations.

	"Hundreds of years ago, a fell power exerted its dark will over Wildemount, corrupting its outlying townships and spreading chaos among its people.

	"The Claret Orders work in relative secrecy, as the nature of their abilities are largely misunderstood and often lead to persecution. Their numbers are small, as the price is great and the Orders only accept those strong of heart with little to lose.

	"Built upon the ruins of the old Winksman Thieves Guild founded under the rule of Drassig, the Clasp is a very well established secret organization consisting of thieves, fences, assassins, saboteurs, spies, and smugglers. Based largely in and under Emon through a network of subterranean tunnels, they run smaller outfits in Westruun, Stilben, and Kymal. Members are branded with the guild's symbol on their mid back, signifying allegiance and commitment. The Clasp operates like a business-minded crime family, celebrating loyalty and truth to one's word over most other merits. A member pays their debts, keeps their promises, and always seeks opportunities for the betterment of the Clasp.": "克拉普是建立在德拉西格统治下的老温克斯曼盗贼公会的废墟上的，是一个非常成熟的秘密组织，由盗贼、栅栏、刺客、破坏者、间谍和走私者组成。他们主要以埃蒙为基地，通过地下隧道网络，在韦斯特鲁恩（Westruun）、斯蒂尔本（Stilben）和基马尔（Kymal）经营较小的组织。会员的背部中间都有公会的标志，象征着效忠和承诺。克拉普的运作方式就像一个有商业头脑的犯罪家族，对忠诚和言而有信的赞美高于其他大多数优点。一个成员要偿还他们的债务，遵守他们的承诺，并始终寻求机会来改善扣带组织的状况。",

	"While the immediate assumption is that the Clasp is merely interested in profit at any cost (and that is a merit of the Clasp), they also wish to preserve the function and prosperity of civilization. It is well known that a thriving city is a profitable one, and an enemy of civilization is a foe of the Clasp. They largely consider themselves a necessary dark underbelly, willing to do the under-the-table deeds that the wealthy and powerful cannot commit with their own hands. The Clasp also understands that conflict breeds a healthy economy, and has occasionally kindled the flames of unrest to keep things tense and profitable. There is also virtue in a distracted administration being easy to manipulate.": "虽然直接的假设是，克拉普只是对不惜一切代价的利润感兴趣（这也是克拉普的优点），但他们也希望维护文明的功能和繁荣。众所周知，一个繁荣的城市是一个有利可图的城市，而文明的敌人就是克拉克普的敌人。他们在很大程度上认为自己是必要的黑暗底层，愿意做那些富人和权贵不能亲手做的台面下的事。克拉普也明白，冲突孕育着健康的经济，并且偶尔会点燃动乱的火焰，以保持紧张和有利可图。一个心不在焉的政府容易被操纵也是一种美德。",

	"While some of the Clasp's activities are secretly state-sanctioned, it is highly illegal and extremely dangerous to be a member or be caught doing business directly with them. Most city guards have orders to arrest upon discovery, and raids are occasionally conducted with varying degrees of success. Having friends in the barracks makes for an easy escape.": "虽然克拉普的一些活动是国家秘密批准的，但作为成员或被发现直接与他们做生意是非常非法和极其危险的。大多数城市守卫都有命令，一旦发现就进行逮捕，偶尔也会进行突击检查，并取得不同程度的成功。在军营里有朋友，可以轻松逃脱。",
	"The Clasp frowns upon dogmatic religion or cultish behavior, as these have conflicted with the organization's business in the past, and always ended messily.": "握手会不赞成教条式的宗教或邪教行为，因为这些行为在过去与该组织的业务有冲突，而且总是以混乱的方式结束。",

Tragically, this ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of the five dragons known as the Chroma Conclave, the subsequent destruction of Emon, and Uriel's death at the talons of the green dragon Raishan. In the chaos, the few surviving members of the newly-empowered Council were scattered, desperate to find safety from the Conclave.

House Glorendar maintains the law and delivers punishment, though a recent scandal that uncovered corruption between House Glorendar and sects of the Carvers has seen them fall from grace, throwing Kraghammer's judicial system into chaos.": "每个统治家族都有自己的专长，并负责管理克拉格默的那个领域。灰刺家族维护着克拉格默下最大的矿场，以及慰藉之池。Zuurthom家族培训城市的首席建筑师，大部分砖石和建筑都是通过他们组织的。青铜峡家族为铁匠公会提供资金，并维护青铜峡金属厂--克拉格莫最大的高炉和矿石精炼厂。Thunderbrand家族以培养克拉格莫最重要的学者和一流的奥术师为荣。Glorendar家族维护法律并实施惩罚，不过最近Glorendar家族和雕刻师教派之间的腐败丑闻让他们失宠，使克拉格默的司法系统陷入混乱。",
	"Kraghammer culture fosters distrust of most nondwarves, especially among the dwarven elite. In this society, the only thing stronger than overt racism is greed. As such, Kraghammer is quick to set aside such prejudice if they sense profit. There is a healthy trade of metals, weapons, and armor with Emon and Westruun, and House Thunderbrand has a good standing with the Council of Tal'Dorei, allowing Kraghammer to utilize the Skyport there to expand their trade reach. Many members of House Thunderbrand also have ties to the Arcana Pansophical.": "克拉格莫文化培养了对大多数非矮人的不信任，尤其是在矮人的精英阶层。在这个社会中，唯一比公开的种族主义更强大的是贪婪。因此，如果他们感觉到利益，克拉哈默人很快就会把这种偏见放在一边。与Emon和Westruun有健康的金属、武器和盔甲贸易，Thunderbrand家族与Tal'Dorei议会有良好的关系，允许Kraghammer利用那里的Skyport来扩大他们的贸易范围。Thunderbrand家族的许多成员也与Arcana Pansophical有联系。",
	"After the Scattered War, the Houses of Kraghammer refused to apologize or make reparations for allying with the Drassig regime. Instead, they have worked toward opening and strengthening trade and commercial alliances as a silent means of conciliation.

	"The Golden Grin (or simply the Grin) exists to enlighten and inspire, keeping ears and eyes out for the murmurs of tyranny and cruelty, seeking to stamp them out.

	"The Golden Grin claims no formal allies and nor will its members reveal themselves as such outside of extenuating circumstances. They approve and elevate groups that work with the people's best interests at heart. Some members do occasionally find their way into higher government, granting a higher vantage point and platform to disseminate the ideals behind their cause. While some may not agree with their rather anarchistic views, Grinners are generally regarded as good and just when revealed.": "金革会没有声称自己是正式的盟友，其成员也不会在情有可原的情况下暴露自己的身份。他们批准并提升那些以人民的最佳利益为中心的团体。一些成员偶尔也会进入上级政府，给予更高的有利地位和平台来传播他们事业背后的理想。虽然有些人可能不同意他们相当无政府主义的观点，但格林纳人被普遍认为是善良和公正的。",

	"Wildemount's greatest organized crime ring is now becoming known throughout Tal'Dorei, but came from humble beginnings. The Myriad began in the Dwendalian city of Yrrosa as a small shipping company specializing in exotic goods and services. They exploited and sold curiosities from the distant continents of Othanzia and Ank'Harel. Over time, as legal trading became more difficult, the Myriad's illegal occupations became their best money makers. Through years of establishing underworld contacts and tactical blackmail, the Myriad evolved into a powerful, well-veiled criminal faction.": "伟德曼最大的有组织犯罪集团现在在整个塔尔多雷都很出名，但它的起点很低。Myriad最初是在德文达利亚的Yrrosa市，是一家专门从事异国货物和服务的小型航运公司。他们开发和销售来自遥远的奥坦兹亚和安克哈勒大陆的奇珍异宝。随着时间的推移，随着合法贸易变得更加困难，迈瑞德的非法职业成为他们最好的赚钱手段。通过多年来建立黑社会的联系和战术性的勒索，Myriad演变成了一个强大的、被掩盖的犯罪集团。",
	"In recent years, the Myriad's aspirations have begun to spread beyond the coasts of Wildemount, and their activities are spilling over into eastern Tal'Dorei—much to the Clasp's consternation. The Myriad are known for displays of opulence and social grace, and this misdirection enables them to seduce and manipulate the lives and will of whomever is deemed valuable to their plans.": "近年来，Myriad的愿望已经开始超越Wildemount的海岸，他们的活动正在蔓延到Tal'Dorei的东部--这让Clasp感到非常震惊。妙音派以展示奢华和社会风度而闻名，这种误导使他们能够引诱和操纵被认为对其计划有价值的人的生活和意志。",
	"The Myriad operates as a loose network of gang bosses running their own localized sects without direct oversight from the mysterious heads of the society. Tithes and information are expected to be delivered to the leadership at a steady rate from each satellite of the organization, and should the rate of return slow, quiet threats of enslavement or destruction soon follow.": "Myriad的运作方式是一个松散的帮派老大网络，他们经营着自己的地方性教派，没有来自神秘的社会首脑的直接监督。人们希望该组织的每个卫星都能以稳定的速度向领导层提供奉献和信息，如果回报率缓慢，则很快会出现奴役或破坏的悄悄威胁。",
	"Keeping mainly to coastal cities and port towns within Tal'Dorei, the Myriad pursues the simple goals of financial excess and maintaining a ledger of favors owed to them by powerful diplomats and officials. Publically dealing in antiquities and exotic textiles, the Myriad runs an efficient black market of slaves, magical beasts, weapons, and illicit substances. Overt violence tends to draw unwanted attention, and the Myriad avoid it when possible, preferring to discredit, blackmail, or frame those who cross them. After all, wielding the secrets of your competitor only makes it easier to eventually force them to work for you. Should such manipulation fail, however, kidnapping or assassination can be a quick and traceless final alternative.": "Myriad主要保留在塔尔多雷的沿海城市和港口城镇，他们追求的目标很简单，那就是财务过剩和维持一个由强大的外交官和官员欠他们的人情账。Myriad公开交易古董和异国纺织品，经营着一个高效的奴隶、魔兽、武器和非法物质黑市。公开的暴力往往会引起不必要的注意，因此妙音派尽可能地避免暴力，而更倾向于诋毁、勒索或陷害那些与他们作对的人。毕竟，挥舞你的竞争对手的秘密只会让你更容易最终迫使他们为你工作。然而，如果这种操纵失败，绑架或暗杀可以是一个快速和无痕迹的最终选择。",
	"As newcomers to the criminal underside of Tal'Dorei, the Myriad find their reach is still limited, though they have managed to infiltrate Stilben and Kymal.

	"In a time long past, an powerful archmage known as the Whispered One attempted to ascend to godhood by conducting the Ritual of Seeding from high atop the citadel of Thar Ampala in the realm of Shadow. The Whispered One surrounded himself with a cult of fanatical mages and empowered murderers to protect him during his ritual of apotheosis. Yet the cult was shattered, and the Whispered One defeated, at the hands of Yos Varda and the Army of the Just. Defeated, ruined, and their Whispered One destroyed, the cult seemingly vanished from the world.": "在很久以前，一个被称为 \"低语者 \"的强大的大法师试图通过在阴影领域的塔尔-安帕拉堡垒的高处举行播种仪式而升为神。低语者用一群狂热的法师和被赋予权力的杀手包围了自己，在他的神化仪式中保护他。然而，在尤斯-瓦尔达和正义军的手中，这个邪教被粉碎了，低语者也被打败了。被打败了，被毁了，他们的低语者也被摧毁了，这个邪教似乎从世界上消失了。",
	"Even in apparent death, this dark mage left instructions with his most devoted, allowing for the possibility of his defeat—and the promise of rebirth.

	"Following the instructions left behind, the Remnants seek to slowly infiltrate and indoctrinate elements of society to prepare for the next stage in the Whispered One's plot. Each separate sect of the cult is named as a part of his body, and acts independently to pursue their assigned tasks. These sub-factions are called the Eyes, the Voice, the Blood, the Hand, and the Heart. Each splinter cult is tasked with infiltrating and corrupting a respective societal core, and it's said that when the time for their dark master's return is nigh, they shall rejoin as one for the ritual.": "按照留下的指示，余党试图慢慢渗透和灌输社会元素，为低语者阴谋的下一阶段做准备。该邪教的每个独立教派都被命名为他的身体的一部分，并独立行动，追求他们所指定的任务。这些分教派被称为 \"眼\"、\"声\"、\"血\"、\"手\"、\"心\"。每个分支邪教的任务是渗透和腐蚀各自的社会核心，据说当他们的黑暗主人回归的时间临近时，他们将作为一个整体重新加入到仪式中。",
	"The Remnants are largely unknown, and wish to remain so. Those who are aware of their presence are either members, or have uncovered their insidious existence and seek to stamp it out wherever it may appear. Thus, there are rarely any alliances made by or with the Remnants.": "残余者在很大程度上不为人知，并希望保持这种状态。那些知道他们存在的人要么是他们的成员，要么是发现了他们阴险的存在，并试图在任何可能出现的地方将其消灭。因此，残余者很少有任何联盟，或与残余者结盟。",

	"During the wars of the Calamity, great destruction rained across the many lands of the world. Broken remnants of history speak of battles between gods leveling mountains and sinking islands.

	"Relics of the Age of Arcanum were further enhanced, creating unheard-of magical capabilities. When the battle climaxed in a wave of aberrant destruction, leaving much of civilization in ruins, many of these artifacts were buried among the ashes with their wielders. Others were passed down through bloodlines for generations, a sign of respect and importance within their culture. Some were locked away, the fear of their power giving temples reason to keep them from mortal hands, while a handful still see use to this day by great warriors or proven killers. These mighty echoes of the last great war, and the divine banishment that followed, are known as the Vestiges of Divergence.": "阿卡诺姆时代的遗物被进一步加强，创造了前所未闻的魔法能力。当战斗在一波反常的破坏中达到高潮，使许多文明成为废墟时，这些文物中的许多被埋在灰烬中，与它们的持有者一起。其他的则通过血缘关系世代相传，成为他们文化中尊重和重视的标志。有些被锁了起来，对其力量的恐惧使寺庙有理由不让它们落入凡人之手，而少数的东西至今仍被伟大的战士或被证实的杀手使用。这些上一次伟大战争的强大回声，以及随后的神圣放逐，被称为分歧的遗迹。",
	"The Vestiges are legendary artifacts that grow in power with the experience, force of will, and strength of character of the bearer.

A dormant state still imbues a modicum of power to the attuned, but with time, perseverance, and personal growth, the Vestige can regain access to some of its lost ability in its awakened state. Eventually, through extreme personal challenge, evolution, and achievement, the Vestige can reach its full potential in its exalted state. This is the true power of the Vestige, the state when it was originally utilized in the Calamity against battle-ready gods.": "遗迹是传说中的神器，其力量随着持有者的经验、意志力和性格强度而增长。许多遗迹，如果被封存起来，或者在一段时间内没有一个值得调教的人，将恢复到休眠状态。在休眠状态下，受调谐者仍有一定的能力，但随着时间的推移、毅力的增强和个人的成长，遗迹可以重新获得其在觉醒状态下失去的一些能力。最终，通过极端的个人挑战、进化和成就，Vestige可以在其高尚的状态下达到其全部潜力。这就是Vestige的真正力量，也是它最初在灾难中被用来对付准备战斗的神的状态。",
	"Keep in mind, the Vestiges of Divergence are very powerful magical items, so consider the intended power level of your campaign before including them, and ensure their discovery and acquisition is treated with the proper amount of weight and responsibility.

	"For a Vestige to progress to a more powerful state (dormant to awakened, or awakened to exalted), consider a catalyst that is specific to the character attuned to it. It could be as simple as having it advance when the character utilizes a class ability a certain number of times, or the relic could upgrade during a personal story beat where they overcome a great fear or point of conflict in their life. Consider something important, impactful, and memorable for the Vestige to further unveil its power to the wielder.": "要想让一个遗迹发展到更强大的状态（从休眠到觉醒，或从觉醒到升华），可以考虑为与之相适应的角色设置一个特定的催化剂。它可以很简单，当角色使用某种能力达到一定的次数时，它就会进步，或者遗物可以在他们克服巨大恐惧或生活中的冲突点的个人故事中升级。考虑一些重要的、有影响的、令人难忘的东西，让遗物进一步向持有者展示它的力量。",

However you wish to formulate your story and world, the existing rules for your game help set a very clear vision of how to run it with consistency and intended design.": "每场运动都以自己的方式开始了它的英雄故事。一个简单的开始是由一群衣衫褴褛的卖家组成的。世界上的学生落入了错误的人群。不知不觉中，命运的棋子被推到了比他们自己更大的地方。无论你希望如何制定你的故事和世界，你的游戏的现有规则有助于设定一个非常明确的愿景，即如何以一致的方式和预期的设计来运行它。",
	"That being said, sometimes the experienced group wishes to add some new flavor to the existing structure of the world. Bring in new options to how old rules function, or adjust to an advanced difficulty in a mystical world where danger, and even death, can be circumvented. This section outlines a number of homebrew rules and guidelines you, and your campaign, can adopt to further customize your gaming experience.": "话虽如此，有时有经验的小组希望在现有的世界结构中加入一些新的味道。为旧规则的运作方式带来新的选择，或者在一个神秘的世界中调整到高级难度，在那里可以规避危险，甚至死亡。本节概述了一些自制的规则和准则，你和你的活动可以采用这些规则和准则来进一步定制你的游戏体验。",
	"Like any homebrew or non-standard rules and option, should any of these elements presented before you be of interest, they must be approved and implemented by the dungeon master of your campaign.

	"When running games of larger party size (generally 6 or more players), the combat action economy can become difficult for some players to feel as involved or active due to fewer rounds of combat generally occurring per encounter. Here are a couple of possible recommendations to better allow characters some freer choices during their turn at the proverbial bat.": "当运行人数较多的游戏时（一般是6个或更多的玩家），由于每次遭遇的战斗回合数较少，战斗行动的经济性会让一些玩家感到难以参与或活跃。这里有几个可能的建议，可以更好地让角色在轮到他们的时候有一些更自由的选择，这就是传说中的蝙蝠。",
	"For those who have watched along with our adventures, you may see some of these optional rules as familiar. Many of the elements included in this chapter are based on or retooled versions of the house rules we tried within our own campaign. Some have undergone a number of changes for balance as we try new things and learn from our experiences. For those that are curious, the ones we utilized within our own game are Rapid Quaffing and Multi-Spell.": "对于那些一直关注我们的冒险的人来说，你可能会看到其中的一些可选规则是熟悉的。本章中的许多元素都是基于我们在自己的战役中尝试过的内部规则，或者是重新调整过的版本。当我们尝试新事物并从我们的经验中学习时，有些规则为了平衡而做了一些改变。对于那些好奇的人来说，我们在自己的游戏中所使用的是 \"快速取证 \"和 \"多重法术\"。",
	"Certain adventures thrive on the adrenaline of the chase, or the ever-present fear of ambush. As it stands, the need to take a short rest can prove difficult during long dungeon crawls, and this lends itself to a nice tone of personal stress and risk-vs-reward. However, sometimes a rest is necessary for the party to even continue, but the current rush of the story's clock won't allow for a standard short rest. You could consider lessening the required time to complete a short rest to 30 minutes or less for the moment, or your entire campaign, as an option. Another possibility is to allow the party to take an Arduous Rally if they so choose.": "某些冒险在追逐的肾上腺素中茁壮成长，或对伏击的恐惧永远存在。就目前而言，在漫长的地牢爬行过程中，需要短暂的休息会被证明是困难的，而这也为个人压力和风险对回报提供了良好的基调。然而，有时休息是必要的，甚至可以让队伍继续前进，但目前故事的时间紧迫，不允许进行标准的短暂休息。你可以考虑把完成短暂休息所需的时间缩短到30分钟或更短，作为一种选择，或者你的整个活动。另一种可能性是，如果他们选择的话，允许他们进行一次艰苦的集结。",
	"Character death can often prove to become a minor inconvenience in some campaigns once the adventuring party reaches a certain level, with spells being available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife with temporary setbacks, robbing a small element of danger and threat to future conflicts and challenges within the story. If you wish to elevate the gravity of character death, you can introduce any of these optional rules.": "一旦冒险队伍达到一定的级别，角色的死亡在某些战役中往往会被证明是一个小小的不便，法术可以让死去的战友从来世返回，但会有暂时的挫折，为故事中未来的冲突和挑战剥夺了一个小小的危险和威胁元素。如果你想提升角色死亡的严肃性，你可以引入这些可选规则中的任何一条。",
	"Like all of the great rites of passage in life, death changes us, and simply returning to the world of the living does not undo that change, nor is it at all simple.

	"The lands of Tal'Dorei are rife with dangers, challenges, and mysteries. As you craft your own stories that traverse these fantastical paths, your players will encounter NPCs of many factions, backgrounds, and skill sets to either lend to their cause, or attempt to end it where they stand.": "Tal'Dorei的土地充满了危险、挑战和神秘。当你制作自己的故事，穿越这些奇幻的道路时，你的玩家将遇到许多派别、背景和技能组合的NPC，他们或者为他们的事业提供帮助，或者试图在他们的立场上结束它。",
	"The cities and strongholds of the folk from the {@b Campaigns} chapter (see p. 22) are not the only civilizations on thecontinent. The term \"monstrous races\" was first coined by humans under the rule of Drassig. Some say it was an attempt to demonize those who resisted colonization, others assert that their evil is inherent. Depending on the story you want to tell in Tal'Dorei, either point of view may be true—or, for a morally ambiguous story, both could have shades of truth.": "{@b Campaigns}章节（见第22页）中民间的城市和据点并不是该大陆上唯一的文明。\"畸形种族 \"一词最早是由德拉西格统治下的人类提出的。有人说这是为了妖魔化那些抵制殖民化的人，也有人断言他们的邪恶是与生俱来的。根据你想在Tal'Dorei讲述的故事，任何一种观点都可能是真实的--或者，对于一个道德模糊的故事，两者都可能有真相的影子。",
	"Regardless of how righteous, civilized, or intelligent these beings are, most will attack humans and humanoids on sight, and negotiations can be difficult. However, some are willing to make alliances out of desperation, greed, or even pure goodness unclouded by prejudice.

	"These descriptions are to aid a GM's roleplaying of NPCs outside of the typical player races. By giving monsters depth and civilization, a GM can make their intelligent monsters more than just XP to be gained. How does a goblin tribe retaliate to an attack compared to a flayer enclave?

	"As we grow, we are often taught to fear the unknown. To stay close, stay safe, and bury our curiosity. I rebelled like many youth do and struck out into the world, using my faith and wit to cast away the shadow of mystery. Do you know what I discovered, child? I found the shadow does not cast away easily. The wilds harbor dangers untold, and the black of night shields many hungry mouths full of teeth and malice. So... Listen to my words, child: Stay close, stay safe, and by the wisdom of the Changebearer, bury your curiosity with all your might.": "在我们成长的过程中，我们经常被教导要害怕未知的东西。待在身边，保持安全，并埋葬我们的好奇心。我像许多年轻人一样反抗，向世界发起冲击，用我的信仰和智慧来驱除神秘的阴影。孩子，你知道我发现了什么吗？我发现阴影并不容易被驱散。荒野中隐藏着难以言喻的危险，黑色的夜幕掩盖了许多充满牙齿和恶意的饥饿的嘴。所以......听从我的话，孩子。靠近点，保持安全，以变革者的智慧，全力掩盖你的好奇心。",
	"The vilest and most intelligent of Tal'Dorei's monstrous civilizations, aberrations lurk in corkscrewing caverns deep below the surface of the earth. There is no question that aberrations are truly, irredeemably evil—all who attempt diplomacy with these twisted monstrosities end up as their food, or worse, their braindead thralls.": "反常者是Tal'Dorei畸形文明中最邪恶和最聪明的，他们潜伏在地球表面以下的螺旋形洞穴里。毫无疑问，反常者是真正的、不可救药的邪恶--所有试图与这些扭曲的怪物进行外交的人最终都会成为它们的食物，或者更糟糕的是，成为它们的脑残粉。",
	"Many kinds of aberrant civilizations exist; some are lost cities of the ancient aboleth, while others are active colonies of flayers. What all types of aberrant civilizations have in common is that they are not of this world, and that all of Exandria's creatures are chattel, a resource to be enslaved, traded, and consumed. The underground empires of the dark elves have long since succumbed to madness, their psyches shattered and their bodies twisted by the aberrations' unnatural influence. Even the deep dwarves, the duergar, struggle against the tide of madness.": "存在着许多种类的反常文明；有些是古代阿波利斯的失落城市，有些则是活跃的剥皮者殖民地。所有类型的反常文明都有一个共同点，那就是他们不属于这个世界，所有艾克桑德里亚的生物都是动产，是可以被奴役、交易和消费的资源。黑暗精灵的地下帝国早已屈服于疯狂，他们的精神被打碎，他们的身体被反常者的非自然影响所扭曲。即使是深层矮人，杜尔加人，也在与疯狂的浪潮作斗争。",
	"Though every dark elf is familiar with the dark whispers that echo within their mind, and every duergar child knows the stories of the Thousand Eyes in the Deep, the races of the surface world are unprepared for the aberrant threat that lurks below them. Of the many alien beasts that plot against the surface world, the remnants of the aboleth empire are the most ambitious. As beings of the darkness, their only hope of conquering the surface world is to unite their domains. Overseer Durrom, lord of Salar, plots to collapse the Pillars of the Earth that support the surface of Tal'Dorei, causing the continent to crumble into his subterranean realm.": "尽管每个黑暗精灵都熟悉回荡在他们脑海中的黑暗低语，每个杜尔加人的孩子都知道深海中千里眼的故事，但地表世界的种族对潜伏在他们下面的反常威胁毫无准备。在众多密谋反对地表世界的外星野兽中，阿波利斯帝国的残余是最有野心的。作为黑暗中的生物，他们征服地表世界的唯一希望就是联合他们的领地。萨拉尔（Salar）的统治者杜罗姆（Durrom）阴谋推翻支撑塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei）表面的大地之柱，使该大陆崩塌，进入他的地下王国。",
	"Major aberrant settlements include the flayer colony of Yug'Voril, deep below Kraghammer, and the aboleth ruins of Salar, beneath Emon. It stands to reason that nearly every major humanoid settlement has a city of otherworldly horror hidden beneath it. Perhaps that's why city life is so maddening.": "主要的反常定居点包括深藏在克拉格莫下面的尤格沃里尔（Yug'Voril）的火器殖民地，以及埃蒙下面的萨拉尔（Salar）的阿波利斯（Aboleth）遗迹。按理说，几乎每一个主要的类人聚居地下面都隐藏着一座异世界的恐怖城市。也许这就是为什么城市生活如此令人抓狂。",
	"The term beastfolk was coined by humans as a way of referring to a half dozen separate cultures native to central Tal'Dorei. The wild magic released during the early era of the Age of Arcanum,as well as the chaotic energies scattered during the Calamity, did more than just destroy armies: it created entirely new races from the animals of the world. Some creatures created by this outpouring of magic remain feral beasts, like the abominable owlbear or giant toad. Others, however, gained increased intelligence, the ability to create tools, and the capacity to form civilizations.": "Beastfolk这个词是人类创造的，用来指代原产于Tal'Dorei中部的半打独立文化。在阿卡纳姆时代早期释放的狂野魔法，以及在灾难期间散布的混乱能量，不仅仅是摧毁了军队：它从世界的动物中创造了全新的种族。一些由这种魔法的涌现所创造的生物仍然是野性的野兽，如可憎的猫头鹰熊或巨型蟾蜍。然而，其他人则获得了更高的智力，创造工具的能力，以及形成文明的能力。",
	"During the Calamity, many elves fled into the Feywild to escape the war. One elven tribe that remained on Exandria to fight alongside their gods were the Horselords of Laphithas. The elves of Laphithas rode alongside the elven god Archeart against the mortal servants of the Ruiner, but the entire tribe was slain in a burst of chaotic magic when the Archeart stabbed the Ruiner through his eye, their power merging their mortal bodies with their horses. The Archeart rewarded his followers by reviving them as centaurs to ride across the Dividing Plains, forever free of war. The centaurs have diverged from their elven ancestry, but still hold a grudge against the elves of Syngorn for fleeing when their need was greatest. They are an incredibly faithful people—worshipping their creator with a fervor unknown even among the elves.": "在灾变期间，许多精灵为了躲避战争而逃到了魔界。有一个精灵部落留在埃克桑德里亚，与他们的神灵并肩作战，这就是拉菲萨斯的骑士们。Laphithas的精灵们与精灵之神Archeart并肩作战，对抗毁灭者的凡人仆人，但当Archeart刺穿毁灭者的眼睛时，整个部落在一阵混乱的魔法中被杀，他们的力量将他们的凡人身体与马匹融合在一起。弧光之心为了奖励他的追随者，将他们复活为半人马，骑着马穿越分界平原，永远摆脱了战争。半人马已经脱离了他们的精灵祖先，但仍然对辛戈恩的精灵在他们最需要的时候逃离而心存怨恨。他们是一个极其忠实的民族--以一种甚至在精灵中都不为人知的狂热来崇拜他们的造物主。",
	"This story conflicts somewhat with the creation myth of the orcs, who were elves corrupted by the spilled blood of the Ruiner. It is possible that neither story is entirely accurate—or that both are. If both centaur and orcs are elves altered by the Ruiner's defeat, it would certainly explain the two peoples' long-standing hatred for one another.": "这个故事与兽人的创世神话有些冲突，兽人是被毁灭者溢出的血液腐蚀的精灵。有可能这两个故事都不完全准确，也有可能两者都是。如果半人马和兽人都是被毁灭者打败而改变的精灵，这无疑可以解释这两个民族长期以来对彼此的仇恨。",
	"The betrayer god known as the Spider Queen was one of the first casualties of the Calamity; she was impaled by the Stormlord's thunderspear before her drow soldiers even saw battle. Her blood, thick and silvery, pooled in the sunless caverns beneath the world. In the years to come, it was discovered by her most loyal dark elven servants, and they drank deeply. The blood of the Spider Queen granted them the goddess's terrible power and warped their bodies until they were half-spider, half-elf. The driders grew in number as more and more drow accepted this gift, but the pools of divine blood began to run dry, and they found themselves tormented by its absence. The driders now roam the underground, desperately searching for hidden pools of the silver nectar. Yet, for their agony, they may still be in better shape as a tribal civilization than the dark elves.": "被称为蜘蛛女王的背叛者神是灾变的首批伤亡者之一；在她的乌鸦士兵还没有看到战斗之前，她就被风暴领主的雷电之矛刺穿了。她的血，浓稠的银色，汇集在这个世界下面没有阳光的洞穴里。在以后的岁月里，她最忠诚的黑暗精灵仆人发现了这一点，他们深深地喝了下去。蜘蛛女王的血液赋予他们女神的可怕力量，并使他们的身体扭曲，直到他们成为半蜘蛛半精灵。随着越来越多的乌鸦接受了这份礼物，龙人的数量越来越多，但神血之池开始枯竭，他们发现自己被神血的缺失折磨着。现在龙人在地下游荡，拼命寻找隐藏的银色甘露之池。然而，对于他们的痛苦，作为一个部落文明，他们的状况可能仍然比黑暗精灵好。",
	"As their canine appearance suggests, gnolls were once mere hyenas. A pack of wild dogs was caught in the divine eminence of an unknown deity entering Exandria to do battle in the Calamity, and when the nimbus faded, the beasts were transformed. Today, most gnolls are still nomadic tribes led by a matriarch and her mate, finding food where they can, be it scavenged carrion or more civilized sustenance from human caravans along the Silvercut Roadway. Gnolls are a people with few allies, seen as weak by the Ravagers of the Dividing Plains, godless by the centaurs, and thieving by the people of Tal'Dorei. Some gnolls have found a home in Kymal and Westruun, and other tribes like the Dustpaws have formed a tentative alliance with the city-folk to ward off the bloodthirsty Ravagers.": "正如它们的犬类外观所示，地精曾经只是土狼。一群野狗被一个不知名的神灵的神力所吸引，进入艾克桑德里亚，在灾难中进行战斗，当神力消失后，这些野兽被改造了。今天，大多数地精仍然是由一个女族长和她的配偶领导的游牧部落，他们在任何地方都能找到食物，无论是拾取的腐肉，还是从银切公路沿线的人类商队那里获得更多文明的养料。地精是一个几乎没有盟友的民族，被分裂平原的掠夺者视为弱者，被半人马视为无神，被Tal'Dorei的人视为小偷。一些地精在凯末尔和韦斯特鲁恩找到了自己的家，其他部落如尘爪（Dustpaws）已经与城市居民形成了初步的联盟，以抵御嗜血的掠夺者。",
	"Once, the depraved lizardfolk were called the Kuul'tevir, noble masters of the earth and sky, created in the image of the first dragons—and in the time of the Founding, they built cities with magic nearly on par with that of the elves. The fires of their furnaces burned so hot their blood turned cold, and protective powers granted to them by the gods so great that their skin turned to scales. In those times, they were the paragon of warrior-priests.": "曾经，堕落的蜥蜴人被称为Kuul'tevir，是大地和天空的高贵主人，是按照第一条龙的形象创造的--在建国时期，他们用几乎与精灵一样的魔法建造了城市。他们的熔炉之火烧得很热，他们的血液变得冰冷，诸神赋予他们的保护力量如此巨大，以至于他们的皮肤变成了鳞片。在那个时代，他们是战士牧师的典范。",
	"However, in the wake of eons of violent, selfish pursuits during the Age of Arcanum, they are left now diminished, their cities turned to rubble, their magic forgotten, and their god-empress succeeded by a cabal of petty warlocks. After untold eons, many lizardfolk were so desperate to escape the squalor of K'Tawl Swamp, they chose to be dominated by the Cinder King. In their occupation of Emon, they once again felt a twinge of their ancestors' glory—but it has again turned to ash. The few surviving lizardfolk kingdoms are led by warlocks who siphon power from demons and immortal spirit nagas, forfeiting their souls in a vain hope to emerge once more from the swamps and conquer Tal'Dorei.": "然而，在阿卡纳姆时代的暴力和自私的追求下，他们现在变得越来越少，他们的城市变成了废墟，他们的魔法被遗忘，他们的女神被一帮小术士所继承。在数不清的年代之后，许多蜥蜴人急于逃离K'Tawl沼泽的肮脏环境，他们选择了被煤渣王所支配。在对埃蒙的占领中，他们再次感受到了他们祖先的荣耀--但它再次变成了灰烬。少数幸存的蜥蜴人王国由术士领导，他们从恶魔和不朽的精神纳迦身上吸取力量，放弃自己的灵魂，妄想再次从沼泽中出现并征服塔尔多雷。",
	"The remains of a lizardfolk empire inhabited by the Children of the Cloaked Serpent, a people more humanoid than lizard-like, can be found on Visa Isle, south of Daggerbay.": "在Daggerbay南部的Visa Isle上可以找到蜥蜴人帝国的遗迹，该帝国由斗篷蛇的孩子们居住，他们更像人类而不是蜥蜴人。",
	"Known by sailors as the \"sea devils,\" the shark-like sahuagin are both enemy and ally to humans who ride the waves, and are rumored to have spawned from a bottomless trench in the ocean floor. Pods of sahuagin have no de facto leader, and are usually have no more than six members, though sometimes several pods band together and collaborate on tasks they could not accomplish alone, forming schools. These schools follow the will of the majority, and disobedience to this will is surprisingly rare. The few sea devils who dominate multiple schools through personal strength are known as barons, and are as hated as they are revered. Sahuagin schools that fall under the sway of a baron are those most known for their piracy and slaughter, for they steal treasure to appease their tyrant's greed. Free schools often offer their service as mercenaries, aiding humanoids as much as they oppose them.": "被水手们称为 \"海魔\"，像鲨鱼一样的萨瓦金既是乘风破浪的人类的敌人，也是他们的盟友，据传他们是从海底的无底壕沟中产生的。sahuagin的荚果没有事实上的领导者，通常有不超过六个成员，尽管有时几个荚果联合起来，合作完成它们无法单独完成的任务，形成学校。这些学校遵循大多数人的意愿，不服从这种意愿的情况出奇地少。少数通过个人力量主宰多个流派的海魔被称为男爵，他们既被憎恨又被敬重。受男爵控制的萨瓦金学校以海盗和屠杀而闻名，因为他们偷盗财宝以满足暴君的贪婪。自由派经常作为雇佣兵提供服务，既帮助人类，又反对人类。",
	"There are some pods that have fallen under the twisting influence of abhorrent, alien gods beyond the boundaries of reality. These often become cults of worship, merging pods into larger societies in service to the maddening whispers of these forgotten terrors, hidden within isolated ruins or swamp dens.": "有一些豆荚已经在可恶的、超越现实边界的外星神的扭曲影响下堕落。这些往往成为崇拜的对象，将豆荚合并成更大的社会，为这些被遗忘的恐怖的令人疯狂的低语服务，隐藏在孤立的废墟或沼泽地中。",
	"Originally created during the Age of Arcanum as living siege weapons and protectors of labyrinths where treasures and secrets were hidden away, minotaurs have had to find their own purpose in the aftermath of the Calamity. Like most folk, when freed, they immediate retreated to the places that were most comfortable for them, and there they remain to this day. Clans of minotaurs can often be found in winding mountain passages and intricate cavern systems, using their innate comprehension of labyrinths to easily navigate such defensible spaces. The few roving clans of minotaurs that remain in Exandria have developed an isolated culture that prizes martial prowess but is led by spirit-whisperers similar to warlocks.": "牛头人最初是在阿卡纳姆时代被创造出来的，作为活的攻城武器和藏有宝藏和秘密的迷宫的保护者，在灾难过后，他们不得不找到自己的目的。像大多数人一样，当被释放后，他们立即撤退到对他们来说最舒适的地方，而且至今仍在那里。在蜿蜒的山路和错综复杂的洞穴系统中经常可以发现牛头人氏族，利用他们与生俱来的对迷宫的理解力，他们可以轻松地在这种可防御的空间中穿梭。留在埃克桑德里亚的少数游荡的牛头人氏族已经发展出一种孤立的文化，他们崇尚武功，但由类似于术士的灵语者领导。",
	"People don't discover the fey; the fey discover people. Though enchanted forests are their favored domain, the fair folk can be found wherever the power of nature is strong—even a flower garden in the middle of Emon. Of course, Emonian fey scholars debate which came first: did the fey come to a forest because it was magical, or did the magic bloom because of the fey? All fey mysteries have the same solution: if an answer exists, it is known only by the Archfey, and they don't like spilling secrets.": "人们不会发现精灵，精灵会发现人们。虽然被施了魔法的森林是他们最喜欢的领域，但只要自然界的力量强大，就能找到仙女们，甚至是埃蒙中部的花圃。当然，埃蒙的费族学者们争论的是哪个先来：费族来到森林是因为它有魔力，还是魔力因费族而盛开？所有的费伊之谜都有相同的解决方案：如果存在答案，也只有大费伊知道，而他们不喜欢泄露秘密。",
	"The Feywild is a place of intense emotion. Happiness becomes elation, anger becomes fury, and passions become obsessions. The very shape of the fey are defined by their innermost feelings, and even siblings can take different forms based on what they feel most strongly about. Two daughters from pixie parents are just as likely to be a sprite and a satyr if one sister is drawn to war and the other to wild parties. It is uncommon—though certainly not unheard of—for a fey to completely and spontaneously change form after a life-altering event. Since most fey live for upward of three centuries, particularly unstable fey take nearly a dozen forms over the course of their life, wildly altering in shape, sound, gender, and all other things mortals take for granted.": "翡冷翠是一个充满强烈情感的地方。幸福变成欢欣，愤怒变成暴怒，激情变成痴迷。精灵的形状是由他们内心深处的感受决定的，即使是兄弟姐妹也会根据他们最强烈的感受而采取不同的形式。如果父母是小精灵的两个女儿，一个被战争所吸引，另一个被狂野的聚会所吸引，那么她们同样可能成为精灵和萨提尔。在发生改变生活的事件后，一个精灵完全自发地改变形态是不常见的，但肯定不是没有。由于大多数费伊人的寿命长达三个世纪，特别不稳定的费伊人在其一生中会有近十种形态，疯狂地改变形状、声音、性别和所有其他凡人认为理所当然的东西。",
	"The only immutable fairies are the Archfey. Immortal, imperious rulers of fairykind, the Archfey very rarely travel to Exandria, instead spending their time scheming against each other plotting elaborate political overthrows. Of course, when mortals enter their realm, the Archfey take notice and often spy on them in person, using clever disguises and misdirection to keep them from disrupting their own maneuvering. Most recently, Vox Machina was trailed by Lord Artagan of the Morncrown, a jovial Archfey who finds the incursions of mortals more amusing than distressing.": "唯一不变的仙女是大帝。大仙们是仙界不朽的统治者，他们很少到埃克桑德里亚来，而是把时间花在互相算计上，策划精心的政治颠覆。当然，当凡人进入他们的领域时，大酋长会注意到并经常亲自监视他们，使用巧妙的伪装和误导来防止他们破坏自己的行动。最近，Vox Machina被Morncrown的Artagan勋爵跟踪，他是一个幽默的大法官，认为凡人的入侵更有趣，而不是苦恼。",

Today, giants live far away from major cities, as they have been hunted down for centuries and driven far from humanoid civilization.": "一些人类的民间传说说，巨人是人类的先驱，是诸神创造人类的失败尝试。还有人说，巨人是那些试图自己升为神的人类的产物，他们与恶魔讨价还价，吸收了泰坦元素精神的精华。今天，巨人生活在远离大城市的地方，因为他们已经被猎杀了几个世纪，并被驱赶到远离人形文明的地方。",
	"Ogres, cyclopes, and hill giants are the lowest of the giantkin and act as a sort of barrier between human and giant civilizations. The lowborn group together, cast out from highborn society and forced to fight and forage to survive. Cyclopes tend to rule lowborn settlements, and some hill giant warriors ritualistically tear out an eye in order to emulate their rulers—and some zealous hill giants do the same in worship to the Ruiner. Wealthier hill giants create fanciful eyepatches to wear over one of their eyes. Ogres are not clever beasts, and they lack the charisma of cyclopes and the dull cunning of hill giants. They rely entirely on numbers and brute force to overwhelm their prey.": "食人魔、独眼巨人和山丘巨人是最低级的巨人，是人类和巨人文明之间的一种障碍。低等民族聚集在一起，被高等民族社会抛弃，被迫为生存而战斗和觅食。独眼巨人倾向于统治低等人的定居点，一些山地巨人战士为了效仿他们的统治者，会在仪式上撕下一只眼睛，而一些狂热的山地巨人也会这样做，对毁灭者进行崇拜。较为富有的山地巨人会创造出富有想象力的眼罩，戴在自己的一只眼睛上。食人魔不是聪明的野兽，它们缺乏独眼巨人的魅力和山地巨人的沉闷狡猾。他们完全依靠数量和蛮力来压倒他们的猎物。",
	"Sometimes lowborn tribes are taken over by trolls or oni—creatures so loathsome that the highborn banished them from the caste system entirely—and transform lowborn communities into terrifying armies of evil.": "有时，低种姓部落被巨魔或鬼怪占领--这些生物是如此令人厌恶，以至于高种姓将它们完全从种姓制度中驱逐出去--并将低种姓社区变成可怕的邪恶军队。",
	"The humanoid peoples of Tal'Dorei divide the highborn giants into types: cloud, fire, frost, stone, and storm. In truth, these are not different \"races\" of giant so much as there are different cultures.

Even the hill giants were once highborn, but they were stripped of their nobility and exiled by the Council of Seven Scepters, and their people have fallen into ruin.": "Tal'Dorei的人形民族将高出生的巨人分为几个类型：云、火、霜、石和风暴。事实上，这些并不是不同的巨人 \"种族\"，而是有不同的文化。虽然他们采用了不同的魔法、道德和法律准则，以及战斗风格，但他们都是高血统。即使是山丘巨人也曾经是贵族，但他们被七权杖议会剥夺了贵族身份并被流放，他们的人民已经陷入了毁灭。",
	"Cloud giants are denizens of Jovatthon, the Castle of Thunder. This mighty city-state flies invisibly above Tal'Dorei enshrouded in thick stormclouds, tracing a clockwise circular route around the continent, avoiding its cloudless, arid heartland. The cloud giants are ruled by two wedded kings, a City-King in charge of domestic affairs, and a War-King tasked with the defense of Jovatthon against both dragons and other highborn giants. The current City-King is a stern, fearsome ruler named Ardokles, while the War-King is a much more charismatic and beloved general named Vasilios.": "云巨人是雷霆城堡Jovatthon的居民。这个强大的城邦在厚厚的风暴云层中无形地飞翔在塔尔多雷的上空，沿着顺时针方向绕行大陆，避开其无云、干旱的中心地带。云雾巨人由两位国王统治，一位是负责国内事务的城主，另一位是负责保卫乔瓦图恩的战王，以抵御龙和其他高血统巨人。现任城主是一位严厉的、令人生畏的统治者，名叫阿多克勒斯，而战王则是一位更有魅力的、受人爱戴的将军，名叫瓦西利奥。",
	"Fire giant civilization's heart is the city-state of Vulkanon, built deep into the magma tunnels that run beneath the heart of the Cliffkeep Mountains. The fire giants seem shorter than other highborn, but only because of their perpetually stooped posture. They are masters of the forge, and have been known to occasionally ally with the duergar of the Emberhold to produce some of the finest arms ever seen in Tal'Dorei. Vulkanite weapons are prized by mercenaries across the continent, and are as much a status symbol as they are an excellent weapon. The giants of Vulkanon have long dreamed of empire, and their duergar allies have given them a foothold in Tal'Dorei's darkest depths. They may be an excellent ally in the fight against the aberrations lurking below.": "火巨人文明的核心是沃尔卡农城邦，它建在克利夫普山脉中心地带下面的岩浆隧道深处。火巨人看起来比其他高人更矮，但这只是因为他们永远弯着腰的姿势。他们是锻造大师，据了解，他们偶尔会与恩伯霍德（Emberhold）的杜尔加（duergar）合作，生产一些在塔尔多雷见过的最好的武器。瓦肯人的武器被整个大陆的雇佣兵所珍视，它们既是一种地位的象征，也是一种优秀的武器。沃卡农的巨人长期以来一直梦想着建立帝国，他们的杜尔加盟友让他们在塔尔多雷最黑暗的深处有了立足之地。在与潜伏在地下的反常者的斗争中，他们可能是一个出色的盟友。",
	"A quality of fire giants you don't hear mentioned all that often is that some are shockingly good card players.": "你并不经常听到有人提到火灾巨头的一个品质，那就是有些人是令人震惊的好牌手。",
	"Frost giants make their home in the Neverfields, the frozen wasteland north of the Cliffkeep Mountains. Though their people are mostly nomadic reavers led by petty jarls, they all swear fealty to High King Jorskymmar, who rules from the fortress-city of Jotunborg. The frost giants are master animal-tamers, and are known to raid human villages with remorhazes, mammoths, and even white dragons at their side. Frost giants are among the most pious of the highborn, and most pray to the Wildmother for safety before crossing the ice fields.

	"Stone giants live in fortresses carved from the peaks of mountains. Their greatest stronghold is Skyanchor Citadel, a city hidden within a mountain of the Alabaster Sierras, its halls winding from its deepest roots to its highest summit. The stone giants view physical perfection to be the greatest of all virtues, and are obsessed with both physical appearance and feats of strength. Unlike the lowborn giantkin, who prize brute force over all else, the lithe stone giants see all forms of physical power as worthy. An quadrennial tournament of prowess called the Sky Queen's Favor is held in the coliseums atop Skyanchor, and giants from across Tal'Dorei gather to compete in tests of strength, agility, and endurance. Some champions of the smaller races even join, and goliath competitors are not an unusual sight at the Sky Queen's Favor.": "石头巨人生活在从山峰上凿出的堡垒中。他们最大的堡垒是天锚堡垒（Skyanchor Citadel），这是一座隐藏在雪花石山脉中的城市，其大厅从最深的根部蜿蜒到最高的山顶。石巨人认为身体的完美是所有美德中最伟大的，他们对身体的外观和力量的壮举都很着迷。不像低等的巨人族，他们把蛮力看得比什么都重要，身材轻盈的石巨人认为所有形式的体力都是值得的。四年一度的能力竞赛被称为 \"天后的恩惠\"，在天阳城顶的竞技场举行，来自整个塔尔多雷的巨人聚集在一起，参加力量、敏捷和耐力的测试。一些较小种族的冠军甚至也加入进来，在天空女王的宠爱中，巨大的竞争者并不是罕见的景象。",
	"Storm giants are the most mysterious of all the highborn. Their flying city-state of Tempestar was destroyed by an unknown force in times long past, and all the glories of their realm were cast into the Lucidean Ocean, hundreds of miles off the coast. The storm giants live solitary lives, keeping no other giant for their neighbor, protecting only themselves and their families. Centuries have passed since Tempestar was the seat of the Council of Seven Scepters, yet the reclusive storm giants are still considered part of the highborn out of fear of their sorcerous power. The cloud giant kings are particularly concerned with appeasing the storm giants; if unified, the remnants of Tempestar could conquer the flying city of Jovatthon with ease.": "风暴巨人是所有贵族中最神秘的。他们的飞行城邦Tempestar在很久以前被一种未知的力量摧毁了，他们王国的所有荣耀都被扔进了离海岸数百英里的Lucidean海洋。风暴巨人过着孤独的生活，没有其他巨人作为他们的邻居，只保护他们自己和他们的家人。自从坦佩斯塔成为七权杖议会的所在地后，几个世纪过去了，但出于对他们巫术力量的恐惧，隐居的风暴巨人仍被认为是高人的一部分。云巨人国王特别关注安抚风暴巨人；如果团结起来，暴风城的残余势力可以轻松征服飞行城市约瓦通。",
	"The Council of Seven Scepters unifies the highborn, ruling from the tallest spire of Jovatthon. One member of each giant civilization is sent as a representative to serve on the council and keep the rulers of each city-state from causing chaos. Already beset by enemies across Tal'Dorei, from the fast-breeding humans to the vengeful lowborn, the last thing the highborn desire is infighting. Two of the seven thrones have remained empty for generations; Hillqueen Ovam'mura refused to relinquish her scepter when her people were banished, and the Scepter of Wodensdottr has gathered dust in the vaults since Woden, demigod of the storm, abandoned the storm giants after the fall of Tempestar.": "七权杖议会统一了高人，在乔瓦通最高的尖顶上进行统治。每个巨型文明都有一名成员作为代表被派往议会工作，以防止每个城邦的统治者造成混乱。整个Tal'Dorei已经被敌人所困扰，从快速繁殖的人类到复仇的低等血统，高等血统最不希望的就是内讧。七个王座中的两个已经空了好几代了；当她的人民被放逐时，希尔克恩-奥瓦姆穆拉拒绝放弃她的权杖，而沃登斯多特的权杖自从风暴半神沃登在暴风城陷落后抛弃了风暴巨人后，就在保险库里积满了灰尘。",
	"Humans outsiders are often confused by the existence of seven scepters for six giant civilizations. The answer is laughably simple to any cultured giant; the cloud giants' two kings each claim one of the scepters, and each claim a seat on the council.": "外来的人类常常对六个巨人文明的七根权杖的存在感到困惑。对任何有文化的巨人来说，答案简单得令人发笑；云端巨人的两位国王各自拥有一根权杖，并各自在议会中拥有一个席位。",
	"have often speculated why the three known races of goblinkind are so wildly different from one another. Why have goblins never formed an organized society when the hobgoblin Iron Authority has ruled the southern tip of the Rifenmist Peninsula for generations? Why are bugbears covered with fur when their kin only have hair on their head, and their bodies are otherwise disquietingly smooth? Human, elven, and dwarven nations have warred with the goblinkin throughout recorded history, and their few attempts to send envoys to goblin enclaves have always ended disastrously. Why?": "人们经常猜测，为什么地精的三个已知种族之间会有如此大的差异。为什么妖精从未形成一个有组织的社会，而妖精铁局却世代统治着里芬米斯特半岛的南端？为什么虫熊浑身都是毛，而它们的亲属只有头上的毛，而且它们的身体在其他方面也是令人不安的光滑的？在整个有记载的历史中，人类、精灵和矮人国家都曾与妖精打过仗，而他们为数不多的向妖精飞地派遣使节的尝试总是以灾难性的结局告终。为什么？",
	"Discovering the origin of goblinkind may be an exciting campaign arc, and one that can synergize with a campaign about the gods and the Age of Arcanum. In that time, the goblins lived far from Vasselheim, the Cradle of Creation. They resided on the other side of the world, in the land known today as Wildemount. There were no goblins, hobgoblins, or bugbears then: were all one people; a strong, cunning, and multitudinous race known as the Dranassar.": "发现妖精的起源可能是一个令人兴奋的活动弧线，而且可以与有关诸神和阿卡诺姆时代的活动协同进行。在那个时代，妖精们生活在远离瓦塞尔海姆的地方，创造的摇篮。他们居住在世界的另一边，在今天被称为Wildemount的地方。那时没有妖精、霍布林或虫族：都是一个民族；一个强壮、狡猾、数量众多的种族，被称为德拉纳萨族。",
	"When the Betrayer Gods were freed from their planar prison, the divine Strife Emperor revealed himself to the Dranassar, and they were enthralled by his fell power. Many of the Dranassar followed him willingly, and their great kingdom of Ghor Dranas became the seat of the Betrayers' power. Those who opposed their emperor were forcibly bent to his will. When the Strife Emperor's armies needed skirmishers, he corrupted his Dranassar slaves into tiny goblins. When he needed new legions, he twisted them into hobgoblins. When he needed spies, they became bugbears.": "当背叛者诸神从他们的星球监狱中被释放出来时，神圣的纷争大帝向德拉纳萨人显露了自己，他们被他堕落的力量迷住了。许多德拉纳萨人心甘情愿地追随他，他们伟大的古尔-德拉纳斯王国成为背叛者的权力所在地。那些反对他们的皇帝的人被强行屈服于他的意志。当纷争皇帝的军队需要小兵的时候，他把他的德拉纳萨奴隶腐蚀成小妖精。当他需要新的军团时，他把他们扭曲成霍布革人。当他需要间谍的时候，他们就变成了虫族。",
	"The Calamity has long since ended, but the effects of the Strife Emperor's subjugation of the Dranassar still haunt Exandria. The goblinkin on Tal'Dorei are the descendants of the armies who failed to dominate the new continent. Only a handful of Dranassar remain in Tal'Dorei, though they are more plentiful in Wildemount, where the ruins of Ghor Dranas still loom across its jagged peaks. They live alone in the shadows, trying in vain to cleanse their twisted kin of the Curse of Strife.": "灾难早已结束，但纷争皇帝征服德拉纳萨尔的影响仍然困扰着埃克桑德里亚。塔尔多雷的戈布林肯人是那些未能统治新大陆的军队的后代。只有少数德拉纳萨尔人留在塔尔多雷，不过他们在怀德蒙（Wildemount）的数量更多，那里的戈尔-德拉纳斯（Ghor Dranas）废墟仍在嶙峋的山峰上隐约可见。他们独自生活在阴影中，徒劳地试图将他们扭曲的亲属从纷争的诅咒中净化出来。",
	"Goblins are like vermin. Any human knows that, and it might be the one thing dwarves and elves can agree upon, too. They breed faster than rats, and sire children half as smart—or so the saying goes. Goblins have no cities of their own, and only name their temporary raid camps after the \"kill-boss\" who founds it. If not for smarter, more organized goblinoid species, the lesser goblins would probably have probably lost all semblance of civilization, and become as wild beasts. If nothing else, they are easily manipulated by threat of force and promise of reward. Goblins can be found anywhere on Tal'Dorei, and are surprisingly adaptive to unwelcoming environments.": "妖精就像害虫。任何人类都知道这一点，这可能也是矮人和精灵可以同意的一件事。他们的繁殖速度比老鼠还快，所生的孩子也只有老鼠的一半聪明--或者这么说。哥布林没有自己的城市，只是以创建它的 \"杀人老板 \"的名字来命名他们的临时袭击营地。如果不是有更聪明、更有组织的地精物种，小地精可能可能已经失去了所有的文明迹象，变成了野兽一样。如果不出意外，他们很容易被武力的威胁和奖励的承诺所操纵。妖精可以在塔尔多雷的任何地方找到，而且对不受欢迎的环境有惊人的适应性。",
	"The hobgoblins of the Rifenmist Peninsula learn from an early age that they are born to serve the Iron Authority. The unholy Strife Emperor may have stripped the hobgoblins of their free will, but their mortal Iron Emperor has stripped them of free thought. Hobgoblin are among Tal'Dorei's foremost military strategists, and this tactical acumen makes them potent propagandists, as well. Every hobgoblin blindly serves the caste above them. For soldiers, this is their commanding officer. For serfs, this is their feudal lord. For the Iron Emperor, there is only one greater power: the Strife Emperor himself.": "里芬米斯特半岛的妖精们从小就知道，他们生来就是为了服务于钢铁权威。邪恶的纷争皇帝可能剥夺了霍布林的自由意志，但他们的凡人铁皇帝却剥夺了他们的自由思想。妖精是Tal'Dorei最重要的军事战略家之一，这种战术上的敏锐性使他们也成为强有力的宣传者。每个妖精都盲目地服务于他们上面的种姓。对于士兵来说，这就是他们的指挥官。对于农奴来说，这就是他们的封建主。对于铁皇帝来说，只有一个更大的权力：纷争皇帝本人。",
	"The hobgoblin warbands that threaten Tal'Dorei's hillfolk are slightly different. Though many owe allegiance to the Authority, their distance from imperial propaganda has given these field scouts a different perspective. Each soldier within a company is unflinchingly loyal to their commander, but they are also all a distinct individuals with goals beyond merely testing the readiness of Syngorn and Emon for conquest. A few rare hobgoblins have even been known to defect from their company after tasting freedom, though many have been too thoroughly indoctrinated to seek freedom, even if it is offered to them.": "威胁塔尔多雷的山民的哥布林战队略有不同。虽然很多人都效忠于当局，但他们与帝国宣传的距离让这些野战侦察兵有了不同的视角。一个连内的每个士兵都坚定不移地忠于他们的指挥官，但他们也都是一个个与众不同的个体，他们的目标不仅仅是测试辛戈恩和埃蒙的征服准备情况。少数罕见的妖精甚至在尝到自由的滋味后叛离他们的连队，尽管许多妖精已经被彻底灌输了自由思想，即使有人向他们提供自由。",
	"Trying to reason with a hobgoblin is like trying to have a conversation with a very sharp axe swinging at your head. In fact, the two are practically one and the same.": "试图与一个妖精讲道理，就像试图与一把挥舞在你头上的非常锋利的斧头进行对话。事实上，这两者实际上是一体的。",
	"Ghor Dranas has long since fallen, and the bugbears have loyalty for neither other goblins, nor the divine Strife Emperor. Where hobgoblins are willing to give all for the collective, bugbears are fiercely individualistic. Of all the goblinoids, bugbears are also the most willing to collaborate with humans and elves, and are renowned throughout Tal'Dorei's criminal underworld as top-notch burglars and bounty hunters. Bugbears who choose to offer their services to the Clasp or the Myriad are usually found in Tal'Dorei's largest cities, but those who avoid a life of crime typically live alone in the wilderness. Despite the sinister reputation of their kin, many of these hermits take up a life of peaceful druidism, fighting only to protect their animal friends and secure their own isolation.": "戈尔-德拉纳斯早已沦陷，虫族既不忠于其他妖精，也不忠于神圣的纷争皇帝。妖精们愿意为集体付出一切，而虫族则是激烈的个人主义。在所有的地精中，虫熊也是最愿意与人类和精灵合作的，并且在整个Tal'Dorei的黑社会犯罪中作为一流的窃贼和赏金猎人而闻名。选择为Clasp或Myriad提供服务的虫族通常在Tal'Dorei最大的城市被发现，但那些避免犯罪生活的虫族通常独自生活在野外。尽管他们的亲属有着险恶的名声，但这些隐士中的许多人过着和平的德鲁伊生活，只为保护他们的动物朋友和确保自己的孤立而战斗。",
	"Throughout much of Tal'Dorei, the word \"orc\" is synonymous with slaughter. The people of the Dividing Plainslive in constant fear of wandering bands of orcs, especially the bloodthirsty horde known as the Ravagers. Most live in small, animalistic packs within the valleys between the peaks of the Stormcrest and Cliffkeep mountain ranges. These packs are chaotic, leaderless, and easy to scare away at the first sign of resistance. However, when a particular orc distinguishes itself from the pack, either through preternatural strength or uncommon viciousness, it quickly establishes itself as the pack's alpha. An orc pack led by an alpha rapidly grows in size by absorbing leaderless packs. When the alpha believes its pack has grown large enough, it runs rampant across the land, slaughtering and pillaging everything in its wake.": "在Tal'Dorei的大部分地区，\"兽人 \"一词是屠杀的同义词。分水岭的人们一直生活在对流浪的兽人队伍的恐惧之中，尤其是被称为 \"掠夺者 \"的嗜血部落。大多数兽人都生活在风暴峰和克利夫维斯特山脉的山峰之间的山谷里，形成了小型的、动物性的群体。这些群体是混乱的，没有领导者，一有反抗迹象就容易被吓跑。然而，当一个特定的兽人从群体中脱颖而出时，无论是通过超自然的力量还是不寻常的凶残，它很快就会确立自己是群体的首领。一个由首领领导的兽人族群通过吸收无首领的族群迅速扩大规模。当首领认为它的族群已经足够大时，它就会在这片土地上横冲直撞，屠杀和掠夺它身后的一切。",
	"Most humans have no remorse for orcs. They view them as savage, bloodthirsty beasts. And in a way, they are correct. Nearly every living orc is a ruthless killing machine, driven by its animal urges to kill, devour, and reproduce. But things were not always this way. In the time before the Calamity, there were no orcs. They were created by accident when the Archeart, god of elves, shot out the eye of the war god now known as the Ruiner. The Ruiner's blood poured from his wound and rained upon the armies of elves and humans that served the Archeart. These unsuspecting mortals were changed; their muscles bulged, wicked tusks grew from their jaws, and their minds burned with a thirst for blood.": "大多数人类对兽人毫无悔意。他们认为他们是野蛮的、嗜血的野兽。在某种程度上，他们是正确的。几乎每一个活着的兽人都是一个无情的杀人机器，被其杀戮、吞噬和繁殖的动物冲动所驱动。但事情并不总是这样的。在灾变之前的时代，没有兽人。他们是在精灵之神Archeart射出现在被称为毁灭者的战神的眼睛时意外产生的。毁灭者的血从他的伤口涌出，洒向为Archeart服务的精灵和人类的军队。这些毫无戒心的凡人被改变了；他们的肌肉隆起，邪恶的獠牙从他们的下颚长出，他们的头脑燃烧着对血的渴望。",
	"Even today, some orcs still possess scraps of rational thought. Though the Ruiner's fiery blood sears their minds, what remains of their human and elven ancestry longs to treat others with love and tenderness, not with hate and pain. This knowledge is all but unknown to the people of Tal'Dorei—no one has ever studied the orcs, and those who claim to have been saved from a raid by a merciful orc are mocked, their story derided as a traumatic fantasy.": "即使在今天，一些兽人仍然拥有残缺的理性思维。尽管毁灭者炽热的血液灼伤了他们的头脑，但他们残留的人类和精灵的祖先渴望以爱和温柔对待他人，而不是以仇恨和痛苦。这些知识对塔尔多雷的人来说几乎是未知的--没有人研究过兽人，那些声称被仁慈的兽人从突袭中救出来的人被嘲笑，他们的故事被嘲笑为创伤性的幻想。",

	"She is often depicted as a young woman of dark complexion and long, light brown hair that cascades to form the road left behind her. Most art shows her in constant motion, trailblazing and ever leading into the unknown.": "她经常被描绘成一个肤色黝黑的年轻女子，浅棕色的长发层层叠叠，形成她身后留下的道路。大多数艺术作品都显示她在不断运动，开拓进取，不断走向未知。",
	"The Changebringer's holy day is New Dawn, and takes place the first day of the first month, when the old year gives way to the new. In Emon, the day of New Dawn is celebrated with a grand midnight feast that commonly features a short play that celebrates the changes of the past year.": "变革者的圣日是新黎明，发生在正月的第一天，即旧年让位于新年的时候。在埃蒙，新曙光之日以盛大的午夜盛宴来庆祝，通常会有一个短剧来庆祝过去一年的变化。",
	"The Dawnfather stands lord over sun and summer, his vigil encircling the ages as the keeper of time. Lord of agriculture and harbinger of the harvest, his followers commonly include farmers and most common folk, his priests welcome in lands all over. Supporter of the needy and destroyer of evil, the Dawnfather is often the patron to Paladins and Rangers who follow a similar creed. The Dawnfather is also known for his defeat of the Chained Oblivion, and is revered by those who hunt aberrations.": "曙光之神是太阳和夏天的主宰，作为时间的守护者，他的守望环绕着整个时代。他是农业的主宰和丰收的预兆，他的追随者通常包括农民和大多数普通人，他的祭司在各地都受到欢迎。曙光之神是有需要的人的支持者和邪恶的毁灭者，他通常是遵循类似信条的圣骑士和游侠的守护者。曙光之父也因击败被锁住的遗忘者而闻名，并受到那些猎杀反常者的敬重。",
	"Tapestries of old match early text describing the Dawnfather as a patronly figure in silver and gold armor, his head a beacon of light and fire so bright that a face could rarely be seen within. Many statues in holy places treat the head as a brazier, lit with each dawn and extinguished with the dusk.": "古老的挂毯与早期文字描述的黎明之父是一个身穿金银盔甲的守护神，他的头是一盏灯火通明的灯塔，里面很少能看到脸。许多圣地的雕像把他的头当作一个火炉，在每个黎明时分点燃，在黄昏时分熄灭。",
	"The Dawnfather's holy day is called Highsummer, and takes place on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. In Emon, the entire week is celebrated with gift-giving and feasting. Festivities begin on Highsummer day and end at midnight on the twenty-first, the day that Zan Tal'Dorei dethroned Trist Drassig at the Battle of the Umbra Hills. In Whitestone, the feast of Highsummer is instead a festival of lights around the Sun Tree; gift-giving is traditional, but the recent Briarwood occupation and the subsequent recovery means money is thin. Most folk choose to spend Highsummer with their family, recounting the small things they are thankful for.": "曙光之父的圣日被称为 \"盛夏\"，发生在第七个月的第十五天。在埃蒙，整个星期都是以送礼和宴请来庆祝的。庆祝活动从盛夏日开始，到21日午夜结束，这一天是赞-塔尔多雷在翁布拉山之战中废黜特里斯特-德拉西格的日子。在白石，盛夏节是围绕太阳树的灯光节；送礼是传统的，但最近布里亚伍德的占领和随后的恢复意味着钱很稀少。大多数人选择和他们的家人一起度过盛夏，讲述他们所感谢的小事。",
	"God of compassion and redemption, her message is one of understanding and optimism in even the darkest of places. She believes the corrupt can be redeemed, a mindset that led to a betrayal by the Lord of the Hells that left most of her following destroyed in the Calamity. Only recently has her faith been rediscovered, and her temples returned to prominence. The Everlight's followers are often rural healers and community philosophers, becoming a voice of reason and empathy in angry and cynical times.": "慈悲和救赎之神，她的信息是在最黑暗的地方也能获得理解和乐观。她相信堕落的人可以得到救赎，这种心态导致她被地狱之主背叛，使她的大部分追随者在灾难中被摧毁。直到最近，她的信仰才被重新发现，她的神庙也重新获得了重视。长明灯的追随者通常是乡村治疗师和社区哲学家，在愤怒和愤世嫉俗的时代成为理性和同情的声音。",
	"Those who rise to bring her words back to the light unearth her image from ruined temples, or create new art to inspire others with her message. The Everlight is represented as a beautiful, strong woman of dark skin and light hair, rising on a pair of ivory angel wings.": "那些起身将她的话语带回光明的人从废墟的寺庙中发掘出她的形象，或者创造新的艺术，用她的信息激励他人。长明灯被代表为一个美丽、强壮的女人，深色的皮肤和浅色的头发，乘着一对象牙色的天使翅膀上升。",
	"The Everlight's holy day has been long forgotten, and her followers have yet to decide when her festival should be held, and what the festivities should be. The debate has gone on for years, and no great miracles have yet been performed to unify the squabbling clerics.": "长明灯的圣日早已被遗忘，她的追随者尚未决定何时举行她的节日，以及应该举行什么庆祝活动。争论已经持续了多年，还没有伟大的奇迹出现来统一争吵的神职人员。",
	"Revered by seers, sages, and teachers of all walks of life, the Knowing Mistress guided the growth of civilization throughout the Age of Arcanum like sunlight guides the branches of a tree. She was grievously wounded by the Chained Oblivion during the Calamity, and her followers are now hunted by agents of her ancient foes as she recovers in her weakened influence. Her devout now worship in private, spreading knowledge, philosophy, and lore anonymously through traceless channels. ": "被预言家、圣人和各行各业的老师所敬重，知性的女主人引导着整个阿卡诺姆时代的文明发展，就像阳光引导着树枝。在灾难期间，她被锁链遗忘者严重伤害，现在她的追随者被她古老的敌人的代理人追杀，因为她的影响力正在减弱中恢复。她的信徒现在私下崇拜，通过无迹可寻的渠道匿名地传播知识、哲学和传说。",
	"Common representations show the Knowing Mistress as a graying, mature woman of welcoming, matronly smile, swathed in billowing robes and scarves that fan into books and scrolls.": "常见的表现形式显示，知性的女主人是一位白发苍苍的成熟女性，面带欢迎和母性的微笑，身着宽大的长袍和围巾，扇形的书和卷轴。",
	"The Knowing Mistress has no public holy day, for her public worship was shattered during the Calamity, and she has since fallen into half-remembered myth. Only in Emon has the Knowing Mistress's faith been resurrected—though her worship by the intellectuals of the city bears little resemblance to the knowledge-seekers of old.": "知识女主人没有公开的圣日，因为她的公开崇拜在灾难中被打破了，从此她就陷入了半生不熟的神话。只有在埃蒙，\"知识女主人 \"的信仰才得以复活--尽管这个城市的知识分子对她的崇拜与古代的知识追求者没有什么相似之处。",
	"The driving inspiration behind many great inventions, the creation of vast cities, and the bringer of law and order within: the Lawbearer claims dominion over civilization. Judges and rulers pay respect and muse at her temples, which stand as central structures to many cities across Exandria. Peace and order through structure and law guides the will of her devout followers. The Lawbearer has a tempestuous romance with the Wildmother, a furious love that is only tempered when civilization and nature are in balance.": "她是许多伟大发明背后的驱动力，是巨大城市的创造者，也是内部法律和秩序的带来者：法律持有者声称对文明有支配权。法官和统治者们在她的神庙里表达敬意和思考，这些神庙是整个艾克桑德里亚许多城市的中心建筑。通过结构和法律，和平与秩序引导着她虔诚的追随者的意志。法律持有者与女巫有一段激烈的恋情，这种愤怒的爱只有在文明与自然平衡的情况下才会得到缓和。",
	"Shown in most texts and statues as a hooded, armored woman sitting atop a throne of pillars, her face is generally obscured or depicted without expression. The impartial but imposing nature of her stature and presence is nearly always paramount in any visual representation.": "在大多数文本和雕像中，她是一个戴着头罩、身穿铠甲的女人，坐在柱子的宝座上，她的脸通常被遮住或没有表情地描绘出来。在任何视觉表现中，她的身材和存在的不偏不倚但又有气势的性质几乎都是最重要的。",
	"The Lawbearer's holy day is Civilization's Dawn, and is celebrated on the autumnal equinox, usually the twenty-second day of the ninth month. In Emon, each neighborhood celebrates by dancing around great bonfires in the square and giving gifts to celebrate their community.": "守法者的圣日是文明的黎明，在秋分时节庆祝，通常是第九个月的第22天。在埃蒙，每个居民区都会在广场上围着巨大的篝火跳舞庆祝，并赠送礼物以庆祝他们的社区。",
	"Master over the skein of fate and the mistress of winter, the Matron of Ravens stands as the god of death. Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life, watching over the transition between life and death and ensuring the natural transition is undefiled. Many funerals call to her blessing in hopes that she will protect the deceased from the terrible curse of undeath. Those who keep ancient lore believe the Matron of Ravens was once mortal herself, and is the only known mortal to have ascended. Her rise instantly obliterated the previous, now-forgotten god of death, and the other gods quickly and fearfully destroyed the secrets to the rites of ascension.": "命运之弦的主人和冬天的女主人，乌鸦之母作为死亡之神站在那里。她的目光追随并标志着每个凡人生命的结束，监视着生与死之间的过渡，确保自然过渡不受玷污。许多葬礼都需要她的祝福，希望她能保护死者免受不死的可怕诅咒。那些保存古老传说的人相信，乌鸦之母曾经是凡人，而且是唯一已知的升天的凡人。她的崛起瞬间抹去了先前的、现已被遗忘的死亡之神，而其他的神也迅速而恐惧地摧毁了升天仪式的秘密。",
	"Few existing visual depictions of the Matron of Ravens herself exist, with many temples merely using the raven as a symbol of her blessing. Those that do depict her, however, reveal a tall, pale woman wrapped in dangling black linens, her onyx-black hair straight and never ending, her face obscured by a white, porcelain mask.": "现存的对乌鸦之母本人的视觉描述很少，许多寺庙只是将乌鸦作为她的祝福的象征。然而，那些对她的描述显示，她是一个高大、苍白的女人，包裹在悬空的黑色亚麻布中，她的玛瑙黑发直而不乱，她的脸被一个白色的瓷质面具遮住。",
	"The Matron of Raven's holy day is the Night of Ascension, celebrating her apotheosis. The actual date of the goddess's rise to divinity is unclear, but the Night of Ascension is nonetheless celebrated on the thirteenth day of the tenth month. Many people of Emon see this cheery celebration of the dead to be unnerving and macabre, but the Raven's followers believe the honored dead would rather be venerated with cheer, not misery.": "乌鸦之母的圣日是升天之夜，庆祝她的神化。女神升天的实际日期并不清楚，但升天之夜还是在第十个月的第十三天进行庆祝。许多埃蒙人认为这种对死者的欢快庆祝是令人不安和可怕的，但乌鸦的追随者相信，受尊敬的死者宁愿以欢快而非悲惨的方式被敬仰。",
	"The Matron of Ravens is also considered by some the winter patron to the holiday of Winter's Crest: the celebration in Tal'Dorei of freedom from Errevon the Rimelord, celebrated on the 20th day of the twelfth month. Most, however, see this holiday belonging to the people of the land, and recognize no pertaining divine worship.": "乌鸦之母也被一些人认为是冬顶节的冬季守护神：在塔尔多雷，冬顶节的庆祝活动是为了庆祝从雷姆洛德（Errevon）那里获得的自由，庆祝时间是第12个月的第20天。然而，大多数人认为这个节日属于这片土地上的人民，并不承认与之相关的神灵崇拜。",
	"The Moonweaver sends her will as the goddess of moonlight and the autumn season, as well as the patron of illusions and misdirection. Widely worshipped within halfling and elven culture, she is largely considered to be the deity of love, protecting the trysts of lovers with shadows of her own making. Those who work in darkness and trickery often ask for her blessing.": "织月者作为月光和秋季的女神，以及幻觉和误导的守护者，发出了她的意志。她在半身人和精灵文化中受到广泛的崇拜，在很大程度上被认为是爱神，用她自己制造的影子保护恋人的尝试。那些在黑暗和诡计中工作的人经常要求得到她的祝福。",
	"Her depictions are as numerous as the myths and stories of her with meddling within simple unions. However, she is most often painted as a young girl of light blue skin and white hair, her body and limbs but wavy silk strands of silver moonlight that caress and create the edges of the shadows.": "她的描写就像她与插手简单的联盟内的神话和故事一样多。然而，她最常被画成一个浅蓝色皮肤和白色头发的年轻女孩，她的身体和四肢不过是银色月光的波浪形丝线，抚摸和创造阴影的边缘。",
	"The Moonweaver has no holy day, but is celebrated by the elves on the night of the decade's largest full moon. Elven astronomers track the moon's phases and how it grows closer and farther to Exandria, and can predict these days with great accuracy. Many high and haughty elves use this festival as an excuse to be sly and mischievous; some younger elves use costumes and illusions to prank their peers.": "织月者没有圣日，但在十年中最大的满月之夜，精灵们都会庆祝。精灵的天文学家追踪月相以及它与埃克桑德里亚的距离如何拉近和拉远，并能非常准确地预测这些日子。许多高高在上的精灵利用这个节日作为狡猾和调皮的借口；一些年轻的精灵则利用服装和幻觉来恶搞他们的同伴。",
	"The pillar of justice, protection, nobility, and honor, the Platinum Dragon stands as a beacon to many paladins of order and good, and is revered by most metallic dragons as the first of their kind. The crest of the Platinum Dragon adorns many halls of high leadership and justice, his will expected present at all just judgments. To follow him is to look after those who cannot look after themselves.": "铂金龙是正义、保护、高贵和荣誉的支柱，它是许多秩序和善良的圣骑士的灯塔，被大多数金属龙尊称为同类中的第一。铂金龙的徽章装饰着许多高级领导和正义的殿堂，他的意志在所有公正的判决中都会出现。追随他就是为了照顾那些不能照顾自己的人。",
	"This majestic being is often seen emblazoned on shields and armor, both functional and decorative, in the form of a brilliant silver dragon head in profile. Temples and art pieces present a massive, glittering dragon of vibrant platinum sheen and seemingly endless wingspan.": "在盾牌和盔甲上经常可以看到这种威严的存在，无论是功能性的还是装饰性的，都是以一个灿烂的银色龙头的形式出现在侧面。寺庙和艺术作品呈现的是一条巨大的、闪闪发光的龙，具有充满活力的铂金光泽和似乎无穷无尽的翼展。",
	"The Platinum Dragon's holy day is called Embertide, and is celebrated on the fifth day of the eleventh month. This is a day of remembrance, solemnity, and respect to those who have fallen in the defense of others.": "白金龙的圣日被称为Embertide，在第十一个月的第五天庆祝。这是一个纪念、庄严的日子，也是对那些为保护他人而牺牲的人的尊重。",
	"I lift up your name, O First of Dragons, and pray to uphold your sacred charge.": "龙之首啊，我高举你的名字，祈求维护你神圣的职责。",

	"Let me resist temptation and falseness, as your heart guides us.": "让我抵制诱惑和虚假，正如你的心引导我们。",
	"Where thunder cracks and conflict rises, prayers to the Stormlord are shouted into the maelstrom. The Stormlord's followers revel in all tests of strength, and his blessing finds those who prove themselves on the battlefield. He is worshipped by athletes and warriors across Exandria, and his will exalts those whose force of spirit and pension for victory call his attention. He brings tumultuous storms over land and sea, and those who wish for clearer skies offer their praises and prayers in hopes of appeasing his will.": "在雷声大作、冲突不断的地方，对风暴领主的祈祷被喊进了大漩涡。风暴领主的追随者陶醉于所有力量的考验，而他的祝福则是那些在战场上证明自己的人。他被整个艾克桑德里亚的运动员和战士所崇拜，他的意志使那些精神力量和对胜利的渴望引起他的注意。他给陆地和海洋带来了动荡的风暴，而那些希望天空更晴朗的人则提供他们的赞美和祈祷，希望能安抚他的意志。",
	"Within his temples and carvings, the Stormlord is shown as a paragon warrior, often nude and physically the epitome of muscle and strength. Often with beard and short, curled hair, most depictions have the Stormlord in mid-wrestle with a terrible beast, and always in a stance of dominance.": "在他的神庙和雕刻中，风暴领主被显示为一个典型的战士，通常是裸体的，身体上是肌肉和力量的缩影。他通常留着胡子和短而卷曲的头发，大多数描写都是风暴领主在与一只可怕的野兽搏斗中，而且总是摆出统治的姿态。",
	"The Stormlord's holy day is the Day of Challenging, and is celebrated on the seventh day of the second month. The Day of Challenging is one of the most raucous holidays in Emon, and thousands of spectators attend the annual Godsbrawl held in the Temple of the Stormlord to root for their favored deity's champion, particularly the chosen of the Stormlord and the Platinum Dragon.": "风暴领主的圣日是挑战之日，在第二个月的第七天庆祝。挑战日是埃蒙最喧闹的节日之一，成千上万的观众参加每年在风暴领主神庙举行的神灵争霸赛，为他们喜爱的神灵的冠军加油，特别是风暴领主和白金龙的选民。",
	"The realm of the Wildmother extends to wherever the seas shift and the land grows over. Keeper of the wilderness, she represents the wild creatures of nature, the rush of the angry rapids, and the heat-harried stillness of the desert. Elves take up her worship, as do hunters of natural lands, accepting her guidance to exist harmoniously within savage lands. Those seeking safe passage across dangerous waters give prayers to her to guide them. The druids of the Wildmother and clerics of her lover, the Lawbearer, work together to preserve the balance of nature and civilization. It is said that the two goddesses grow furious when this balance is upset, and this fury manifests in Tal'Dorei as devastating natural disasters.": "威尔祖母的领域延伸到海洋转移和土地生长的地方。她是荒野的守护者，代表着自然界的野生生物、愤怒的急流和沙漠中热浪滚滚的宁静。精灵们接受她的崇拜，自然之地的猎人也是如此，接受她的指导，在野蛮的土地上和谐地生存。那些寻求安全穿越危险水域的人向她祈祷，希望她能指引他们。威尔祖母的德鲁伊和她的情人--守法者的神职人员一起工作，以保护自然和文明的平衡。据说，当这种平衡被打破时，两位女神就会大发雷霆，而这种愤怒在塔尔多雷表现为毁灭性的自然灾害。",
	"Seen immortalized through wooden reliefs and carved idols in hidden, overgrown groves and rural shrines, the Wildmother often is depicted as a beautiful woman of green skin nearly swallowed by a wild, tangled wreath of hair, leaves, and vines that dwarf her lithe form.": "通过木质浮雕和雕刻的偶像，在隐蔽的、杂草丛生的小树林和农村的祠堂里，人们看到了不朽的祖母，她经常被描绘成一个绿色皮肤的美丽女人，几乎被野生的、纠缠在一起的头发、树叶和藤蔓所吞没，使她轻巧的身躯相形见绌。",
	"The Wildmother's holy day is Wild's Grandeur, and is celebrated on the vernal equinox, usually the twentieth day of the third month. The people of the southern wilds celebrate the Wildmother's strength by going on a journey to a place of great natural beauty, like the top of a mountain waterfall, or the center of a desert. Wild's Grandeur is rarely celebrated in Emon, but some folk will plant trees in observance of the holiday.": "王母的圣日是 \"野性的伟大\"，在春分时节庆祝，通常是第三个月的第二十天。南部荒野的人们通过去一个具有巨大自然美景的地方旅行来庆祝野性之神的力量，比如山顶的瀑布，或者沙漠的中心。野生的伟大在埃蒙很少被庆祝，但一些民间人士会植树以纪念这个节日。",
	"It is darkness unending, less like a god and more like another world. Life and death do not exist within the Chained Oblivion, an engine of utter destruction and madness. Even the other Betrayer Gods treat this mad god with caution. In its endless imprisonment, it dreams the infinite depths of the Abyss into reality, along with all its demonic legions. The Prime Deities had thought it locked away during the Founding until it nearly returned to ruin the world during the conflicts of the Calamity.": "它是无止境的黑暗，不像是一个神，而更像是另一个世界。生命和死亡不存在于被锁住的遗忘之中，它是一个彻底的毁灭和疯狂的引擎。即使是其他背叛者之神也会谨慎对待这个疯狂的神。在其无尽的囚禁中，它将深渊的无限深渊与它所有的恶魔军团一起梦入现实。在建国时期，主神们一直认为它被锁住了，直到它在灾变的冲突中差点回来毁了这个世界。",
	"Now, its chaotic mind has fallen into more frightful dreams, imagining nightmarish aberrations into existence deep beneath Exandria. The Chained Oblivion's demented cultists work without word from their twisted patron, awaiting the Epoch of Ends, when its freedom will be attained and all beings shall be consumed in deathlessness unending.": "现在，它混沌的头脑已经陷入了更可怕的梦境，想象着噩梦般的反常现象在埃克桑德里亚的地下深处存在。被锁住的遗忘者的疯狂崇拜者在没有得到他们扭曲的守护者的消息的情况下工作，等待着末日纪元的到来，届时它将获得自由，所有的生命将在无尽的死亡中被吞噬。",
	"The few remaining followers of the Knowing Mistress are dedicated to ensuring the Oblivion is never again unchained. Their goddess leading the charge against the all-consuming destroyer god's re-emergence, and though her bravery allowed the other gods of good to shackle their enemy, the victory nearly cost her immortal life. Some say the Knowing Mistress can only be fully restored if the Chained Oblivion is destroyed for good.": "知道女主人剩下的少数追随者致力于确保遗忘之神再也不会被解开枷锁。他们的女神领导着对全能的毁灭者之神重新崛起的冲锋，尽管她的勇敢让其他善神给他们的敌人戴上了枷锁，但这场胜利几乎让她付出了不朽的生命。有人说，只有当被锁住的遗忘之神被永远摧毁时，\"知道的女主人 \"才能被完全恢复。",
	"Few attempts at depicting the image of the Chained Oblivion exist, and the existing texts speak of a creature of rolling, hungry ink and darkness; of a spreading cloud of lightless destruction born from a thousand ravenous mouths. Current references constrain the nightmare with chains of black and gold, barely keeping the dark at bay.": "很少有人试图描绘被锁住的遗忘的形象，现有的文本谈到了一个由滚动的、饥饿的墨水和黑暗组成的生物；一个由一千张贪婪的嘴产生的无光的毁灭的扩散的云。目前的参考文献用黑色和金色的链子限制了这个噩梦，勉强将黑暗挡在门外。",
	"Wanderer in shadow and creator of snakes and serpent-kin, the Cloaked Serpent is the evil god of poisons, assassins, and darkness. Much of ancient serpent-kin worships him over all other deities, dragging screaming offerings to their temples in his honor. Most of the Cloaked Serpent's worshipers were annihilated during the Calamity, and those who weren't are either suspended in self-induced stasis or hunted for sport by the servants of the Spider Queen and the Crawling King. But perhaps the Cloaked Serpent is merely biding his time, waiting for the proper moment to unleash his hidden armies upon the world once more.": "阴影中的流浪者，蛇和蛇类的创造者，斗篷蛇是毒药、刺客和黑暗的邪神。大部分古代蛇人族对他的崇拜超过了其他所有的神灵，他们拖着尖叫的祭品到他们的寺庙里向他致敬。大多数斗篷蛇的崇拜者在灾难中被消灭了，而那些没有被消灭的人要么在自我诱导的静止状态中悬浮，要么被蜘蛛女王和爬行之王的仆人猎杀为乐。但也许斗篷蛇只是在等待时机，等待适当的时机再次向世界释放他隐藏的军队。",
	"The Cloaked Serpent loathes the Lawbearer and the Wildmother, for he despises life, order, and love above all things. His surviving worshipers relish in using poison and fire to undermine civilization and consume nature, hoping to throw the goddesses into fury and consequently cast Exandria into chaos.": "斗篷蛇厌恶律法者和女巫，因为他鄙视生命、秩序和爱，而这一切都高于一切。他幸存的崇拜者乐于使用毒药和火焰来破坏文明和吞噬自然，希望能让女神发怒，从而使埃克桑德里亚陷入混乱。",
	"Many forgotten temples were once built to the Cloaked Serpent, and within these chambers you would find his image engraved within much of the architecture. A human body with a half-dozen arms that houses a gargantuan serpent head, fanged and frilled in aggression. Strands of thick, dark hair that sprout from the scaled body swirl around to form layers of shadow, obscuring the entire form of the entity.": "许多被遗忘的寺庙曾经为斗篷蛇而建，在这些房间里，你会发现他的形象被刻在许多建筑中。一个拥有半打手臂的人体，里面有一个巨大的蛇头，长着獠牙和褶皱，具有侵略性。一缕缕浓密的黑发从有鳞的身体上冒出来，旋转着形成一层层的阴影，掩盖了整个实体的形态。",
	"The dark god of the endless tunnels and caverns beneath Exandria, the Crawling King acts as patron to torturers, slavers, and jailers across the realm. His tears of pain and anger carved the pathways under the world, and his realm of imprisonment is a network of deadly caves and manacles where few return. Those who rob others of their freedom offer prayers to him in cellars and other subterranean domains, and other creatures who live in the darkness below worship him and seek his guidance.": "爬行之王是艾克桑德里亚地下无尽的隧道和洞穴的黑暗之神，他是整个王国的施虐者、奴隶主和狱卒的守护者。他痛苦和愤怒的眼泪刻画了世界地下的通道，他的监禁领域是一个由致命的洞穴和手铐组成的网络，很少有人会回来。那些掠夺他人自由的人在地窖和其他地下领域向他祈祷，而生活在地下黑暗中的其他生物则崇拜他并寻求他的指引。",
	"The Dawnfather and the Everlight defeated the Crawling King during the Calamity by drawing their nemesis above ground. The Dawnfather pierced his body with 10,000 lances of sunlight, and the Everlight imprisoned him within her serene rays.

	"The Crawling king is largely rendered as a swollen, malformed worm that slithers through the dark below, a screaming, hairless human head at the helm with three arms carving through the lightless rock.": "爬行之王在很大程度上被渲染成一条肿胀的畸形蠕虫，在下面的黑暗中滑行，一个尖叫的、没有头发的人头在掌舵，三条手臂在无光的岩石上雕刻。",
	"The devil god of the Hells represents mastery of tyranny and domination. His words are honeyed and carefully crafted, soothing and corrupting the mortal heart. The Lord of the Hells holds his domain with an iron rule, and the punishments that await those that cross him are legendary: the basis of nightmare. Evil entities pay him tribute alongside his devils, while warlocks are drawn to his power.": "地狱的魔神代表着对暴政和统治的掌握。他的话语含情脉脉，精心雕琢，抚慰和腐蚀着凡人的心灵。地狱之神以铁的规则控制着他的领域，等待那些与他作对的人的惩罚是传奇性的：是噩梦的基础。邪恶的实体与他的魔鬼一起向他致敬，而术士们则被他的力量所吸引。",
	"A twisted image of the celestial blood that once bore him, the Lord of the Hells is revealed in many tomes and murals as a handsome humanoid of deep, red skin and long, black hair. Two curling horns rise from his brow, and his lips ever bear a knowing grin.": "地狱之主是曾经孕育他的天体血脉的扭曲形象，在许多书籍和壁画中，他是一个英俊的人形，有着深红的皮肤和黑色的长发。两只卷曲的角从他的眉心升起，他的嘴唇永远带着知心的微笑。",
	"The enemies of The Lord of the Hells are numerous, even among the Betrayer Gods, many of whom only follow the archdevil for fear of his immense power. The Lord of the Hells's archnemesis is the Changebringer, whose mischief and cunning has vexed him throughout the eons. It was she who defeated him in the Calamity by tricking his fiendish armies into attacking one another. The Devil Lord's greatest triumph during the Calamity was fooling and betraying the Everlight and slaughtering all her followers in one fell stroke—a move that today has united the followers of the Everlight and the Changebringer in an unbreakable bond.": "地狱之主的敌人不计其数，甚至在背叛者诸神中也是如此，他们中的许多人只是因为害怕大恶魔的巨大力量而追随他。地狱之王的克星是 \"变化使者\"，她的恶作剧和狡猾让他在漫长的岁月中感到不安。在灾难中，正是她通过诱使他的恶魔军队相互攻击而击败了他。魔王在灾变期间最大的胜利是愚弄和背叛了长明，并一举屠杀了她所有的追随者--这一举动在今天将长明的追随者和变化使者联合起来，形成了牢不可破的联系。",
	"The Ruiner commands roving hordes of barbaric marauders across the lands to destroy, pillage, and slaughter for the joy of it. Orderless and without honor, the creeds of the evil hordemaster push orcs and other evil, savage creatures to devour the world around them, giving in to the chaotic and selfish nature of the predator.
