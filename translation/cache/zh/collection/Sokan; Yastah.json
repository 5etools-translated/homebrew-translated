	"The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage.

	"You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.": "你可能会实现一些超出上述例子范围的目标。尽可能准确地向DM说明你的愿望。在这种情况下，DM有很大的自由度来决定发生什么；愿望越大，出错的可能性就越大。这个法术可能会失败，你所期望的效果可能只实现了一部分，或者你可能会因为你的愿望的措辞而遭受一些不可预料的后果。例如，许愿让一个恶棍死去，可能会把你的时间推进到那个恶棍不再活着的时期，从而有效地把你从游戏中移除。同样地，许愿得到一个传说中的魔法物品或神器，可能会立即把你送到该物品目前的主人面前。",

	"You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.": "你最初了解的是生物的表面想法--它在那一刻最想的是什么。作为一个行动，你可以将注意力转移到另一个生物的想法上，或者尝试更深入地探测同一个生物的思想。如果你深入探究，目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果它失败了，你就能洞察它的推理（如果有的话），它的情绪状态，以及在它心中占据重要位置的东西（比如它担心的、爱的或恨的东西）。如果成功，咒语结束。无论怎样，目标都知道你在探究它的思想，除非你把注意力转移到另一个生物的思想上，否则该生物可以在它的回合中使用它的行动来做一个由你的智力检查所争夺的智力检查；如果它成功了，咒语就会结束。",

You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.": "你也可以用这个法术来探测你看不见的有思想的生物的存在。当你施法时或在持续时间内作为你的行动，你可以在你周围30英尺内搜索思想。该法术可以穿透障碍物，但2英尺的岩石、2英寸的除铅以外的任何金属或薄薄的铅板会阻挡你。你不能探测智力为3或更低的生物，或不说任何语言的生物。",

If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.": "作为一个额外的动作，你可以在任何方向上移动尘土恶魔达30英尺。如果尘魔在沙子、尘土、松散的泥土或轻质沙砾上移动，它会吸走这些物质，并在自己周围形成一个半径为10英尺的碎片云，持续到你下一个回合开始。这片云会严重遮蔽其区域。",

On a success, the spell has no effect.": "你使范围内的一个生物或一个你能看到的物体在持续时间内变大或变小。选择一个生物或一个既没有穿戴也没有携带的物体。如果目标不愿意，它可以做一个 \"宪法救赎\"。如果成功，该法术就没有效果。",
	"If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.": "如果目标是一个生物，它所穿戴和携带的所有东西都会随之改变大小。受影响的生物掉落的任何物品都会立即恢复到正常大小。",
	"The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal {@damage 1d4} extra damage.": "目标的尺寸在所有维度上都增加了一倍，其重量也乘以8。这种增长使其尺寸增加了一个类别--例如从中型到大型。如果没有足够的空间让目标体型翻倍，该生物或物体就会在可用的空间内达到最大可能的尺寸。在咒语结束之前，目标在力量检查和力量投掷上也有优势。目标的武器也会增长到与它的新尺寸相匹配。当这些武器被放大时，目标用它们进行的攻击会造成（%0%）的额外伤害。",
	"The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example.

While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal {@damage 1d4} less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).": "目标的尺寸在所有维度上都减半，其重量也减少到正常的八分之一。这种减少使它的尺寸减少了一个类别--例如从中型到小型。在咒语结束之前，目标在力量检查和力量投掷方面也有劣势。目标的武器也会缩小以符合其新的尺寸。当这些武器被缩小时，目标用它们进行的攻击会减少{@damage 1d4}的伤害（这不能使伤害减少到1以下）。",
	"You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw.

	"You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the {@spell alarm|yastah} spell, a {@spell glyph of warding|yastah}, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.": "你能感觉到在视线范围内的任何陷阱的存在。就这个法术而言，陷阱包括任何会造成你认为有害或不受欢迎的突然或意外效果的东西，而这些效果是其创造者特别设计的。因此，这个法术会感应到一个受（%0%）法术、（%1%）或机械坑道陷阱影响的区域，但它不会显示出地板上的天然弱点、不稳定的天花板或隐藏的天坑。",

	"While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.": "当目标受到法术的影响时，目标会把幻象当作真实的一样对待。目标会将与幻象互动的任何不合逻辑的结果合理化。例如，一个目标试图走过一座横跨鸿沟的幻象桥，一旦踏上桥就会摔倒。如果目标在坠落中幸存下来，它仍然相信桥是存在的，并为它的坠落想出一些其他的解释--它被推倒了，它滑倒了，或者可能是被强风吹倒了。",
	"An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal {@damage 1d6} psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.": "受影响的目标会非常相信幻象的真实性，甚至会受到幻象的伤害。一个被创造成生物的幻象可以攻击目标。同样地，一个被创造成火、酸池或熔岩的幻象可以烧毁目标。在你的回合中，如果目标在幻象的区域内或在幻象的5英尺范围内，每回合幻象可以对其造成（%0%）精神伤害，前提是幻象是一个在逻辑上可以造成伤害的生物或危险，例如攻击。目标感知到的伤害是与幻象相适应的类型。",

The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.": "你把自己传送到一个你能看到的范围内无人的空间。在你消失后，立即响起雷鸣般的轰鸣声，在你离开的空间10英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个宪法救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到{@damage 3d10}雷霆伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。雷声可以从300英尺外听到。",
	"You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity.

	"You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature.

See the {@creature tiny servant|xge|stat block} for its statistics.": "你触碰一个微小的、非魔法的物体，该物体没有附着在其他物体或表面，也没有被其他生物携带。目标物会活过来并长出小臂和小腿，成为你控制下的生物，直到咒语结束或该生物的生命值降至0。其统计数字见（%0%）。",
	"As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you.

You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.": "作为一个额外的行动，如果该生物在你的120英尺范围内，你可以在精神上指挥它。(如果你用这个法术控制多个生物，你可以同时指挥它们中的任何一个或全部，对每一个发出相同的命令。） 你可以决定该生物在下一回合将采取什么行动，以及它将在哪里移动，或者你可以发出一个简单的、一般性的命令，例如取一把钥匙、站岗，或者堆放一些书籍。如果你不发出任何命令，仆人除了保护自己不受敌对生物的攻击外，什么也不做。一旦下达命令，仆人就会继续遵循该命令，直到完成任务。",

	"Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.": "任何进入墙的空间的远程武器攻击在攻击卷上都有劣势，如果火的效果穿过墙到达目标，火的伤害会减半。造成寒冷伤害的法术如果穿过墙壁，会使它们穿过的墙壁区域被冻成固体（至少有5英尺见方的部分被冻结）。每个5英尺见方的冰冻部分拥有AC5和15点命中率。将一个被冻结的部分降低到0命中率会将其摧毁。当一个部分被摧毁时，墙内的水不会填满它。",

Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.": "强风使雾、烟和其他气体无法进入。小的或更小的飞行生物或物体不能通过墙。带入墙内的松散、轻质材料向上飞。向墙后的目标发射的箭、螺栓和其他普通弹丸会向上偏转并自动错过。(巨人或攻城机投掷的巨石以及类似的投射物不受影响）。气态的生物不能通过它。"
