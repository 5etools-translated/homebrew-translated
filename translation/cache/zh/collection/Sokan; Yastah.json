The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.

	"You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.": "你最初了解的是生物的表面想法--它在那一刻最想的是什么。作为一个行动，你可以将注意力转移到另一个生物的想法上，或者尝试更深入地探测同一个生物的思想。如果你深入探究，目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果它失败了，你就能洞察它的推理（如果有的话），它的情绪状态，以及在它心中占据重要位置的东西（比如它担心的、爱的或恨的东西）。如果成功，咒语结束。无论怎样，目标都知道你在探究它的思想，除非你把注意力转移到另一个生物的思想上，否则该生物可以在它的回合中使用它的行动来做一个由你的智力检查所争夺的智力检查；如果它成功了，咒语就会结束。",

The cloud heavily obscures its area.": "作为一个额外的动作，你可以在任何方向上移动尘土恶魔达30英尺。如果尘魔在沙子、尘土、松散的泥土或轻质沙砾上移动，它会吸走这些物质，并在自己周围形成一个半径为10英尺的碎片云，持续到你下一个回合开始。这片云会严重遮蔽其区域。",

	"You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw.

	"While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.": "当目标受到法术的影响时，目标会把幻象当作真实的一样对待。目标会将与幻象互动的任何不合逻辑的结果合理化。例如，一个目标试图走过一座横跨鸿沟的幻象桥，一旦踏上桥就会摔倒。如果目标在坠落中幸存下来，它仍然相信桥是存在的，并为它的坠落想出一些其他的解释--它被推倒了，它滑倒了，或者可能是被强风吹倒了。",
	"An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal {@damage 1d6} psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.": "受影响的目标会非常相信幻象的真实性，甚至会受到幻象的伤害。一个被创造成生物的幻象可以攻击目标。同样地，一个被创造成火、酸池或熔岩的幻象可以烧毁目标。在你的回合中，如果目标在幻象的区域内或在幻象的5英尺范围内，每回合幻象可以对其造成（%0%）精神伤害，前提是幻象是一个在逻辑上可以造成伤害的生物或危险，例如攻击。目标感知到的伤害是与幻象相适应的类型。",

You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.": "该法术可以伪装身体外观，以及衣服、盔甲、武器和装备。你可以使每个生物看起来矮一英尺或高一英尺，看起来瘦、胖或介于两者之间。你不能改变目标的体型，所以你必须选择一个具有相同基本四肢排列的形态。否则，幻觉的程度由你决定。咒语持续的时间，除非你使用你的行动来提前解除它。",
	"The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.": "这个咒语所造成的变化经不起物理检查。例如，如果你用这个咒语在一个生物的装备上加上一顶帽子，物体会穿过帽子，任何接触到它的人都会毫无感觉，或者会感觉到这个生物的头和头发。如果你使用这个咒语使自己看起来比实际更瘦，那么伸手触摸你的人的手会撞到你，而它似乎还在半空中。",
	"A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.": "一个生物可以用它的行动来检查一个目标，并对你的法术保存DC进行智力（（%0%））检查。如果它成功了，它就会意识到目标是伪装的。",

You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.": "你的魔法加深了一个生物对其自身天赋的理解。你触摸一个愿意的生物，并给它一个你选择的技能的专长；直到咒语结束，这个生物在使用所选技能的能力检查中，其熟练度加成增加一倍。",
	"You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.": "你必须选择一个目标精通的技能，而且这个技能还没有从某种效果中受益，例如 \"专长\"，该效果使其熟练度加成翻倍。",

	"On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.": "在你的每个回合中，直到咒语结束，你都可以使用一个额外的动作，用一个使用箭筒里的弹药的武器进行两次攻击。每次你进行这样的远程攻击时，你的箭筒会神奇地将你使用的弹药替换成类似的非魔法弹药片。任何由该法术产生的弹药都会在法术结束时解体。如果箭筒离开了你，该法术也会结束。",
	"You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes {@damage 8d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "你在范围内选择一个点，使精神能量在那里爆炸。以该点为中心的20英尺半径范围内的每个生物都必须做一个智力储蓄动作。智力值为2或更低的生物不能受到此法术的影响。拯救失败时，目标会受到{@damage 8d6}的精神伤害，拯救成功则会受到一半的伤害。",
	"After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a {@dice d6} and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "拯救失败后，目标有1分钟的思维混乱。在这段时间内，它滚动一个{@dice d6}，并从它所有的攻击卷和能力检查中减去所滚动的数字，以及它的宪法救赎来保持注意力。目标可以在它的每个回合结束时进行一次智力救赎，如果成功，则结束对自己的影响。",

When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.": "你获得通过思想移动或操纵生物或物体的能力。当你施法时，以及在持续时间内的每一回合作为你的行动，你可以对你能看到的范围内的一个生物或物体施加你的意志，造成以下相应的效果。你可以一轮又一轮地影响同一个目标，或者在任何时候选择一个新的目标。如果你换了目标，之前的目标就不再受法术影响。",
	"You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell.

	"As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.": "当你施法时，你在地上画一个直径10英尺的圆圈，上面刻有符号，将你的位置与你选择的一个永久的传送圈联系起来，这个传送圈的符号序列你是知道的，而且与你在同一个存在平面。一个闪闪发光的传送门会在你画的圆圈内打开，并保持开放，直到你下一个回合结束。任何进入传送门的生物都会立刻出现在目的地圆圈的5英尺范围内，如果该空间被占用，则会出现在最近的未被占用的空间。",
	"Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern.

You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.": "许多主要的寺庙、行会和其他重要场所都在其范围内的某个地方刻有永久性的传送圈。每一个这样的圆圈都包括一个独特的符号序列--一串以特定模式排列的魔法符文。当你第一次获得施展这个法术的能力时，你会学习物质界上两个目的地的符文序列，由DM决定。你可以在你的冒险过程中学习更多的符号序列。在学习一个新的符号序列1分钟后，你可以把它记在心里。",

All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.": "这个法术在一个半径为50英尺、高为100英尺的圆柱体中扭转重力，以范围内的一个点为中心。所有在该区域内没有以某种方式固定在地面上的生物和物体都会向上坠落，并在你施放此法术时到达该区域的顶部。生物可以做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，抓住它能够到的固定物体，从而避免掉落。",
	"If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.": "如果在这个坠落过程中遇到一些固体物体（如天花板），坠落的物体和生物就会像在正常的向下坠落过程中一样撞击它。如果一个物体或生物到达该区域的顶部而没有撞击到任何东西，它就会留在那里，略微摆动，持续一段时间。",
	"At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.": "在持续时间结束时，受影响的物体和生物会重新倒下。",
	"By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration.

	"You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.

	"You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.": "你决定在你施法时什么会触发石刻。对于刻在表面上的石刻，最典型的触发因素包括触摸或踩到石刻、移除覆盖在石刻上的其他物体、接近石刻一定的距离，或者操纵放置石刻的物体。对于刻在物体上的石刻，最常见的触发因素是打开物体，接近它一定的距离，或者看到或阅读石刻。",
	"You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).

	"When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.": "当你铭刻石刻时，选择下面的一个选项作为其效果。一旦触发，石刻就会发光，使一个半径为60英尺的球体充满昏暗的光线，持续10分钟，之后咒语结束。当石刻激活时，球体中的每个生物都是其效果的目标，在一个回合中首次进入球体的生物或在此结束其回合的生物也一样。",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two {@dice d10}s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a {@dice d8} and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

	"You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.": "你和你的小组（或目标对象）会在一个视觉上或主题上与目标区域相似的不同区域出现。例如，如果你要去你的家庭实验室，你可能会出现在另一个巫师的实验室里，或者出现在一个拥有许多与你的实验室相同的工具和器具的炼金术用品商店。一般来说，你会出现在最近的类似地方，但由于这个法术没有范围限制，你可以想象到你会出现在飞机上的任何地方。",

If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours.
