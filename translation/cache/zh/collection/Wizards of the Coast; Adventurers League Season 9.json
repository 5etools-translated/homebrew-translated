Once your character reaches 20th level, their GP limit resets each time they complete an adventure.": "一旦你的角色赚取的金币数量等于他们的GP上限，{@b inform your DM}；他们就不能再赚取更多，直到他们达到一个新的等级。一旦你的角色达到20级，他们的GP限制就会在每次完成冒险时重置。",

	"{@i {@b Character Rebuilding. You can rebuild your character prior to playing their first adventure as a 5th-level character—changing any of your character's statistics but their name and season. Non-mechanical aspects of your character such as alignment, gender, choice of deity, or personality traits can be changed between sessions regardless of level.": "{@i {@b 角色重建。你可以在你的角色作为5级角色进行第一次冒险之前重建你的角色--改变你的角色的任何统计数据，但他们的名字和季节。角色的非机械方面，如排列、性别、神灵的选择或个性特征，可以在两次会议之间改变，而不考虑等级。",
	"Your character keeps any rewards and equipment earned to that point. If your character's class or background changes, they lose any equipment that it granted, along with the proceeds from selling it, or benefits derived from it, such as copied spells or gold earned by selling it. Similarly, if you change their faction, access to renown benefits are suspended (see Appendix 1: Renown). Story awards can't be rebuilt, not can you rebuild your character if they're dead or otherwise subject to something that removes them from play (see Death, Disease, and Curses, below).": "你的角色保留到那时为止获得的任何奖励和装备。如果你的角色的等级或背景改变了，他们就会失去它所授予的任何装备，以及出售它的收益，或从它获得的好处，如复制的法术或出售它所获得的金币。同样地，如果你改变了他们的派别，获得名声的好处也会被暂停（见附录1：名声）。故事奖励不能被重建，如果你的角色死了或受到某种因素的影响而失去作用，你也不能重建他们（见下面的死亡、疾病和诅咒）。",
	"{@i {@b Death, Disease, and Curses}}. Dead characters or those subject to a condition or story award that removes them from play (vampirism, lycanthropy, petrification, etc.) can't begin a new session until they purchase spellcasting services with gold or trade a permanent magic item (excluding common magic items) to return them to life or to remove any conditions or story awards that removed them from play—including those requiring a wish. This temporarily reduces their Magic Item Limit by 1. This reduction persists until the character reaches the next tier of play (or, for 20th-level characters, until they've completed two adventures). This option is available even if their Magic Item Limit has been reduced to 0 or they have no magic items.": "{@i {@b Death, Disease, and Curses}}. 死去的角色或那些受条件或故事奖励影响而失去游戏资格的角色（吸血鬼、狼人、石化等）不能开始新的会话，直到他们用金币购买法术服务或交易一个永久魔法物品（不包括普通魔法物品）来使他们恢复生命或消除任何使他们失去游戏资格的条件或故事奖励--包括那些需要愿望的。这将使他们的魔法物品限额暂时减少1。这一减少一直持续到该角色达到下一个游戏层级（或者，对于20级的角色，直到他们完成两次冒险）。即使他们的魔法物品限额已经降到了0或者他们没有魔法物品，这个选项也是可用的。",
	"By adventuring, your character establishes themselves among the denizens of Faerûn. As their reputation grows, they can call in favors from those they have crossed paths with along their journeys.": "通过冒险，你的角色在Faerûn的居民中建立了自己的地位。随着他们声誉的提高，他们可以从那些在旅途中与他们有交集的人那里获得恩惠。",
