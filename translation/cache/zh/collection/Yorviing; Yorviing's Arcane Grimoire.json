Since then, the common folk long for the next wizards to arise, to protect them and lead society into a new era of peace.": "一个世纪前，强大的奥术魔法师曾经拯救了你们的家园，但他们中的许多人在此过程中迷失或死亡。从那时起，老百姓渴望下一个巫师出现，以保护他们并带领社会进入一个新的和平时代。",

	"This school of magic is meant to serve as a more 'futuristic' style of magic, though while it will be more at home in a sci-fi or futuristic setting or world, it can be used in standard medieval fantasy worlds as well as a newly discovered branch of magic.": "这个魔法流派旨在作为一种更加 \"未来主义 \"的魔法风格，虽然它在科幻或未来主义的背景或世界中会更加自如，但它可以用于标准的中世纪幻想世界，也可以作为新发现的魔法分支。",
	"When Quantumurgy is implemented in futuristic settings, it can be made to be as common as other forms of magic, such as evocation or transmutation. There may even be a rich tradition of quantum mages that are seen as equals to abjurers or conjurers. Quantumurgy can be seen as a way of understanding the arcane energies that lie at the subatomic levels of the universe and of all things, and thus may lead to both academic and mystic interpretations of how this school of magic is used and studied.": "当量子学在未来主义的环境中被实施时，它可以被做成和其他形式的魔法一样普遍，比如唤醒或转化。甚至可以有一个丰富的量子法师传统，被视为等同于驱魔师或魔法师。量子学可以被看作是理解宇宙和万物的亚原子层面的神秘能量的一种方式，因此可能导致对这一魔法流派的使用和研究的学术和神秘的解释。",
	"When Quantumurgy is implemented in older, medieval styled settings, this school of magic can be seen as a newly discovered form of magic that wizards have stumbled upon, or can even be ancient, long forgotten magic that otherworldly beings may pass on to those who seek the power that lies in quantumurgy. Perhaps this magic is granted as a special boon to a warlock who has served their patron well. Or, perhaps quantumurgy is a school of magic that has only been discovered by wizards, thus only wizards may have access to these spells.": "当Quantumurgy在古老的、中世纪风格的环境中实施时，这个魔法流派可以被看作是巫师们偶然发现的一种新的魔法形式，或者甚至可以是古代的、被遗忘已久的魔法，其他世界的人可能会把它传给那些寻求Quantumurgy力量的人。也许这种魔法是作为一种特殊的恩惠赐予那些为他们的赞助人服务周到的术士。或者，也许量子学是一个只有巫师才能发现的魔法流派，因此只有巫师才能使用这些法术。",
	"Currently, these spells are not listed to any particular class aside from wizard. There are two reasons for this. The first is that this school is a more academic school, and thus may suit better for wizards and potentially warlocks. The second reason is so that a DM who uses quantumurgy in their setting or world can have the freedom with how to interpret this school of magic, and how it best works with what they are running.": "目前，除了巫师之外，这些法术并没有列在任何特定的等级上。这有两个原因。第一个原因是这个学派是一个更学术化的学派，因此可能更适合于巫师和潜在的术士。第二个原因是，在他们的环境或世界中使用量子魔法的管理员可以自由地解释这个魔法流派，以及它如何与他们正在运行的东西最匹配。",
	"To DMs, feel free to implement this new school of magic in whatever way you want regarding your campaign or setting. You are even free to change the name of this tradition if the name would not fight right in your world.": "对于管理员来说，你可以自由地以任何你想要的方式来实施这个新的魔法学派，关于你的活动或设置。如果这个名字在你的世界中不合适，你甚至可以自由地改变这个传统的名称。",
	"This section is dedicated to the new spells that are within the school of quantumurgy, of which there are currently 29, though this list will continue to expand in with future revisions and versions of this school.": "本节专门介绍量子学派中的新法术，目前有29个，不过这个列表会随着该学派未来的修订和版本继续扩大。",
	"Arcane magic has been used in the creation of many wondrous and powerful items throughout history, from unique weapons to versatile trinkets and wares. The following items are magical items to be used in any game, campaign, one shot, or other adventure you wish to run.": "在历史上，奥术魔法被用于创造许多奇妙而强大的物品，从独特的武器到多功能的饰品和物品。以下物品是可用于任何游戏、战役、一击即中或其他你想进行的冒险的神奇物品。",
	"-Frederick Tomunil, author of the 'Olean Manuscript'": "-弗雷德里克-托穆尼尔，\"奥林手稿 \"的作者",
	"The Ovriel Academy is considered by many to be the greatest institution of magical learning ever created. Adhering to a progressive ideology of 'any magical learning is good magical learning', the Academy has been the home of many of the world's greatest wizards. Within its walls of old and weathered stone, students can study and practice any school or form of magic, with only a small number of restrictions which must be adhered to.": "Ovriel学院被许多人认为是有史以来最伟大的魔法学习机构。秉承着 \"任何魔法学习都是好的魔法学习 \"的进步思想，学院一直是世界上许多最伟大的魔法师的家。在其古老和风化的石头墙内，学生可以学习和练习任何流派或形式的魔法，只有少数限制必须遵守。",
	"The Academy's acceptance of magic of all kinds and origins has led to the creation of incredible and influential works of arcane understanding and theory. From works that discussed the finer elements of wielding the power of fire, to a series of documented experiments detailing the methods of how to obtain extensive knowledge of the future, the students, instructors, and alumni of the Academy are heralded as being the mightiest wizards and scholars of the arcane alive.": "学院对各种类型和起源的魔法的接受，导致了令人难以置信的、有影响力的奥秘理解和理论作品的产生。从讨论挥舞火的力量的精细元素的作品，到详细说明如何获得未来广泛知识的一系列有据可查的实验，学院的学生、导师和校友们被誉为最强大的巫师和活着的奥术学者。",
	"However, while the Academy's tolerance for a variety of magic is unprecedented in the world of arcane academics, there are those that see this form of progressive thinking and experimentation as going too far, or perhaps being too dangerous. Critics of the Academy state that allowing for the practice of dark arts such as necromancy or even 'fleshwarping' in addition to the classical instruction of spells of a destructive or manipulative nature allows for the harboring of twisted and potentially dangerous individuals to only grow stronger and more powerful. The Academy, however, has continued to deny this, stating that it is precisely this form of open tolerance towards magic that will prevent the improper use and execution of dangerous magic.": "然而，虽然学院对各种魔法的容忍度在奥术学界是前所未有的，但也有人认为这种进步的思维和实验形式走得太远，或者说太危险了。学院的批评者指出，除了经典的破坏性或操纵性法术教学外，还允许练习黑暗艺术，如死灵法术甚至 \"肉搏术\"，这就使得窝藏扭曲和潜在危险的人只会变得更强大、更有力。然而，学院一直否认这一点，表示正是这种对魔法的公开宽容形式将防止危险魔法的不当使用和执行。",
	"With the ability to study any form of magic within the halls of the Ovriel Academy, students are able to pursue their dreams of mastering, and potentially even discovering, many forms of magic. Sometimes, the sheer number of available lectures and courses can be overwhelming to new and prospective students. However, many are able to navigate their way to attending and studying in a majority of their chosen subjects.": "由于能够在奥弗瑞尔学院的大厅里学习任何形式的魔法，学生们能够追求他们的梦想，掌握甚至有可能发现许多形式的魔法。有时，可用的讲座和课程的数量之多，会让新学生和未来的学生感到不知所措。然而，许多人能够在他们所选择的大多数科目中找到自己的学习方法。",
	"Below are a handful of sample courses that can be used within the Ovriel Academy.

	"As many of the student and faculty of the Ovriel Academy will tell you, the two most important goals of the Academy are the following: the development, experimentation, and understanding of magic, and the preservation of theories, documetation, and works of its students and faculty members for the Academy's use and for generations of spellcasters to come.": "正如许多奥弗瑞尔学院的师生会告诉你的那样，学院最重要的两个目标是：发展、实验和理解魔法，以及保存理论、文献和师生的作品，供学院和未来几代的施法者使用。",
	"While a particular course at the Academy may have a set of specific rules and regulations regarding what the course is dedicated towards, as well as allowing the study and practice of many forms of magic, the Ovriel Academy as an institution does have a set of rules that all students and faculty members must abide by, or risk being permanently expelled and dismissed by the Academy.": "虽然学院的某门课程可能有一套具体的规则和条例，涉及课程的目的，以及允许学习和练习多种形式的魔法，但奥弗莱尔学院作为一个机构确实有一套规则，所有学生和教员都必须遵守，否则就有被学院永久开除和解雇的危险。",

	"The process for applying to become a member of the Ovriel Academy is a rather extensive one. The Academyonly accepts new applicants once a year, and the struggle to become an Academy Student is a difficult game.

	"Witch Covens are a mysterious and ancient part of history. Many live in wild remote areas, practicing ancient and taboo magic deep within darkened woods or haunted deserts. Others live just beyond the edge of civilization, close enough to offer their services to those who seek it while at the same time far enough away to maintain a life of peace. A witch coven may be harsh and cruel to outsiders, tricking them into terrible curses or misfortune should they not be careful of their dealings and wording. Some covens, however, are more generous and kind, serving as a voice of wisdom and council to small villages and hamlets.": "巫师窝是历史上一个神秘而古老的部分。许多人生活在偏远的野外地区，在黑暗的森林或闹鬼的沙漠深处练习古老而禁忌的魔法。其他人则生活在文明的边缘，离得很近，可以为那些寻求服务的人提供服务，同时又离得很远，可以维持和平的生活。巫师团可能对外人苛刻而残酷，如果他们不注意交易和措辞，就会把他们骗到可怕的诅咒或不幸中。然而，有些巫师团则更加慷慨和善良，为小村庄和小村庄充当智慧的代言人和理事会。",
	"Despite this drastic variety of covens, all witches adhere to two basic principles, which some covens refer to as the Rule of Two: the acquiring and protecting of ancient magic and magical secrets, and the Code of Covens. To the former, all witch covens maintain a connection to special magic, and make sure that it does not fall into the wrong hands. The magic that a coven can hold and protect can be as varied as the covens themselves, though all covens protect their secrets from all outsiders, and occasionally from other covens as well. To the latter, all witch covens work together under a set of ancient laws known as the Code of Covens. It is through these laws that witches have each other's backs in times of peace or peril.": "尽管巫师会所种类繁多，但所有巫师都遵守两个基本原则，有些巫师会所将其称为 \"二规则\"：获取和保护古代魔法和魔法秘密，以及巫师会所守则。对于前者，所有巫师团都保持着与特殊魔法的联系，并确保它不会落入坏人手中。一个巫师团可以持有和保护的魔法可以像巫师团本身一样多种多样，不过所有巫师团都会保护自己的秘密，不让外人知道，偶尔也会不让其他巫师团知道。对于后者，所有的女巫会都在一套被称为 \"女巫法典 \"的古老法律下一起工作。正是通过这些法律，女巫们在和平时期或危险时期相互支持。",
	"Yet, even with their mystical abilities and ancient knowledge, all witches know that the world can be as dangerous as it can be peaceful. Witches exist in a constant state of in between do to the nature of an outsiders view on them. Cultures with strong ties to magic or nature may have a more respectful and favorable view on witches, valuing their knowledge, wisdom, and combined powers of nature and the arcane. While on the other hand, some civilizations and cultures may view witches, regardless of their coven's practices, as heretics and bad omens, and may even lead crusades, inquisitions, or witch hunts to purge the land from what they view as an impurity.": "然而，即使拥有神秘的能力和古老的知识，所有女巫都知道，这个世界既可以是危险的，也可以是和平的。由于外人对他们的看法的性质，女巫存在于一种持续的中间状态中。与魔法或自然有密切联系的文化可能对女巫有更多的尊重和好感，重视她们的知识、智慧以及自然和神秘的综合力量。而另一方面，一些文明和文化可能会将女巫视为异端和凶兆，不管她们的女巫会有什么做法，甚至可能导致十字军东征、审讯或猎杀女巫，以清除他们认为不纯的东西。",
	"With so many different covens, it does not take a very scrutinous eye to see that there is no unified leader amongst the lot of them. The only unifying tie that all covens share are the unanimous upholding of the Rule of Two. Some covens keep to themselves, while others will communicate openly between other sister covens. Occasionally, there are instances where all witch covens gather together for a common goal. Such a goal could be uniting to fight against a zealous inquisition, or because of a rare magical event, such as a Bloodmoon or the sprouting of an ancient tree.": "由于有这么多不同的教派，不需要非常仔细的眼光就可以看出，在这些教派中没有统一的领袖。所有教派的唯一统一纽带是一致维护 \"二元规则\"。有些教派保持自我，而其他教派则会在其他姐妹教派之间公开交流。偶尔会有这样的情况：所有巫师团体为了一个共同的目标聚集在一起。这样的目标可能是联合起来对抗狂热的宗教裁判所，或者是因为一个罕见的魔法事件，如血月或一棵古树的发芽。",

	"{@b Coven of Lies.} The Coven of Lies is one of the most feared covens in the land. Witches who belong to this coven often summon great spiders to aid them in battle, and are known for their use of deadly poisons. What makes them dangerous, however, is their ability to move stealthily and to be patient. Many witches in this coven use spiders to spy upon others, seeing through the eyes of a spider while it sits patiently in the webs in the corners of dark rooms or forests.": "{@b Coven of Lies.} 谎言集会是这片土地上最可怕的集会之一。属于这个巫师团的女巫经常召唤大蜘蛛来帮助她们作战，并以使用致命的毒药而闻名。然而，使她们变得危险的是她们隐蔽行动的能力和耐心。这个女巫团中的许多女巫利用蜘蛛来监视他人，当蜘蛛耐心地坐在黑暗房间或森林角落的网中时，她们会通过蜘蛛的眼睛来观察。",
	"{@b Coven of Might.} The Coven of Might lives up to their namesake by training in the art of combat and acquiring power through whatever means necessary. These witches will often hone their skills in weaponry, and may even don armor in warfare. Their greatest strength, however, comes from their ability to draw allies to their cause and to have others work alongside of them. Great minotaur and mighty beasts will follow these witches to achieve whatever goal they are after.": "{@b Coven of Might.} 强大的女巫会不辜负他们的名字，通过训练战斗的艺术和通过任何必要的手段获得力量。这些女巫经常磨练自己的武器技能，甚至可能在战争中穿上盔甲。然而，她们最大的力量来自于她们吸引盟友加入她们的事业并让其他人与她们并肩作战的能力。伟大的牛头人和强大的野兽会跟随这些女巫去实现他们所追求的任何目标。",
	"{@b Coven of Oak.} The Coven of Oak is one that practices what is known as ‘green magic', a type of magic that controls and wields the magical strength of nature itself. Often one of the more peaceful covens, witches within this group tend to wild areas of nature and help protect it. They get along more easily with druids than some other witch covens may, and they are known to be guardians of ancient natural sites, such as mighty old trees or an oasis within a vast desert.": "{@b Coven of Oak.} 橡树女巫团是一个修炼所谓的 \"绿色魔法 \"的团体，这是一种控制和挥霍自然本身的魔法力量的魔法。通常是比较和平的巫师团之一，这个团体中的巫师倾向于自然界的野生区域并帮助保护它。他们比其他一些巫师团体更容易与德鲁伊相处，而且他们是众所周知的古老自然遗址的守护者，如强大的古树或广阔沙漠中的绿洲。",
	"{@b Coven of Light.} The Coven of Light is one of the more recognized covens, and favorably so. Many of these witches will offer their services to heal and help others with their ailments, wounds, or other aspects of their lives. They are often the coven that will live the closest to civilization, and in some cases small hamlets will even spring up around their settlements to protect them in exchange for their aid. These witches are sometimes known as ‘good witches' or ‘witch-doctors'.": "{@b Coven of Light.} 光明女巫团是比较公认的女巫团之一，而且很受欢迎。这些女巫中的许多人都会提供服务，治疗和帮助他人的疾病、伤口或他们生活的其他方面。他们往往是最接近文明的巫师团，在某些情况下，他们的定居点周围甚至会出现小村庄，以保护他们来换取他们的援助。这些女巫有时被称为 \"好女巫 \"或 \"女巫-医生\"。",
	"{@b Coven of Seas.} The Coven of Seas is one of the more nomadic covens, and they travel either on the oceans or journey up the lengths of coasts as the seasons change. They are practitioners of ancient oceanic magic, often using salt, seaweed, and shells in their rituals and spellcasting. They can be as unpredictable as the sea itself, offering aid and guidance through rivers or stormy seas, or can be malevolent deceivers, guiding many a would be voyage to their doom amongst the depths.": "{@b Coven of Seas.} 海洋女巫团是一个比较游牧的女巫团，他们或者在海洋上旅行，或者随着季节变化沿着海岸线旅行。他们是古代海洋魔法的实践者，经常在仪式和施法中使用盐、海草和贝壳。他们可以像海洋本身一样不可预测，在河流或暴风雨的海洋中提供帮助和指导，也可以是邪恶的欺骗者，引导许多将在深海中航行的人走向死亡。",
	"The sheer amount of covens that exist, as well as their different views on the world and magic, means that different philosophies and ideologies are present amongst witchdom. Thus, it is very rare to see all witch covens work towards a specific goal. Rather, each coven's immediate desires, goals, and needs can differ drastically from one another. Some covens seek nothing more than to help or be left alone to study magic, whereas some covens seek domination and control of others.": "由于存在大量的巫师团体，以及他们对世界和魔法的不同看法，意味着不同的哲学和意识形态存在于巫师王国之中。因此，很少看到所有巫师团都为一个特定的目标而努力。相反，每个巫师团的直接愿望、目标和需求都可能大相径庭。有些巫师团只寻求帮助或独自研究魔法，而有些巫师团则寻求统治和控制他人。",
	"The homes and lairs that witch covens reside within are infamous for the mystical properties and ancient magical secrets. Some witch covens homes, referred to as coven lairs, are hidden deep into the wilds and require incredible skill and tracking abilities for all non-witches to find them. Others are nestled within the remains of ancient sites and battlefields, with witches living in haunted and dangerous places.": "巫师会所居住的房屋和巢穴因其神秘的属性和古老的魔法秘密而臭名昭著。有些女巫团体的家，被称为女巫巢穴，隐藏在荒野深处，需要难以置信的技巧和追踪能力，才能让所有非女巫找到它们。还有一些依偎在古代遗址和战场的遗迹中，女巫们生活在闹鬼和危险的地方。",

These traitors and exiled are distinguished by a special mark called the Traitor's Mark, a magical black scar that is magically branded on the hand, arm, forehead, or neck. Through ancient magic, these marks cannot be removed save for a remove curse spell that is cast at the same time of day with a 8th or 9th level spell slot over the course of seven days, after which point the bearer must submerge themselves in a bath of salt water for 8 hours.": "违反《女巫法典》规定的一条法律的女巫被称为叛徒或流亡者。这些女巫被剥夺了她们所拥有的所有礼物和头衔，并被禁止与其他女巫会交谈。这些叛徒和被流放者都有一个特殊的标记，叫做 \"叛徒的标记\"，一个神奇的黑色疤痕，被神奇地烙在手、胳膊、额头或脖子上。通过古老的魔法，这些印记是无法去除的，除非在七天内用八级或九级的法术槽在每天的同一时间施展消除诅咒的法术，之后，持有者必须将自己浸泡在盐水中8小时。",
	"Given their deep connection to ancient magic, as well as the variety of covens that exist, it is no wonder that witches have peculiar traits to them. Many witches, either at birth of upon completion of a Sacred Rite, often have some minor quirk that distinguishes them from the common folk. These quirks can range from the minor to the extreme, from bodily changes to their presence itself. Below is a sample of quirks that your witch character may have. You can roll a d12 or choose from the options in the Witch Quirk Options table to determine your character's specific quirks.": "鉴于他们与古代魔法的深厚联系，以及存在的各种教派，难怪女巫会有奇特的特质。许多女巫，无论是在出生时还是在完成神圣仪式后，往往都有一些小怪癖，将他们与普通人区分开来。这些怪癖的范围从轻微到极端，从身体变化到他们的存在本身。以下是你的女巫角色可能拥有的怪癖的样本。你可以掷出D12或从女巫怪癖选项表中选择，以确定你的角色的具体怪癖。",

	"A group of Coven adventurers can have many reasons for journeying. Many covens send members into cities to spy upon the local lords who are suspicious of witches.

Others may be the sole remaining members of their coven, and as such may want revenge or a new life.": "一群女巫会的冒险者可以有很多理由去旅行。许多女巫会派成员进入城市，监视对女巫有怀疑的当地领主。还有人被派去寻找失踪的女巫，或者帮助另一个女巫会度过可怕的时期。还有一些人可能是他们的女巫团仅存的成员，因此可能想要报仇或获得新的生活。",
