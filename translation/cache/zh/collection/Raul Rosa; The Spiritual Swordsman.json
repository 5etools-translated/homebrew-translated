	"A traveler walks alone through the plains, and a few highwaymen prepare to ambush him. An easy target, so they think. When one of the bandits makes his first move, he falls paralyzed to the ground. Upon seeing this, the others try to react, but can't even get near the traveler. Covered by his cloak the stranger finally reveals himself, with glowing eyes and an even brighter shortsword shining in his hand. The pressure in the area is unbearable, and the thugs can't move a finger. \"What is that?\" they ask themselves. They couldn't know they were before a powerful spiritual swordsman, whose overwhelming presence was enough to defeat them.": "一个旅行者独自走在平原上，几个公路工人准备伏击他。他们认为这是一个容易的目标。当其中一个强盗做出第一个动作时，他瘫倒在地。看到这一幕，其他人试图做出反应，但甚至无法接近这个旅行者。在斗篷的掩护下，这个陌生人终于显露出来，他的眼睛发光，手中的短剑更是闪闪发光。该地区的压力是无法忍受的，打手们无法移动一个手指。\"那是什么？\"他们问自己。他们不可能知道他们面前的是一个强大的精神剑客，他压倒性的存在足以打败他们。",
	"Seven years of training in the frozen mountains, this half-elf had already forgotten what society means. He had been through the most desperate situations, the harshest kinds of training, driven only by his former master. Master who had died some time ago, but kept guiding new pilgrims through the mountain. The half-elf knew his master would only be free to go to the other world once he finished his training, and so he trained.": "在冰山上训练了七年，这个半精灵已经忘记了社会意味着什么。他经历了最绝望的情况，最严酷的训练，只由他以前的主人驱动。师傅已经死了一段时间，但他一直在引导新的朝圣者穿过山。半精灵知道他的主人只有在他完成训练后才能自由地去另一个世界，所以他也在训练。",
	"A group of cultists prepare to summon a powerful demon. They think they are alone, but from the shadows a skilled tiefling suddenly emerges, and one by one he reaps their souls and absorbs the energy of their spirits. The cultists had summoned the wrong devil.": "一群邪教分子准备召唤一个强大的恶魔。他们认为自己是孤独的，但从阴影中突然出现了一个熟练的铁皮人，他一个接一个地收割他们的灵魂，吸收他们精神的能量。邪教徒们召唤了错误的魔鬼。",
	"A spiritual swordsman uses the power of his bond with the spirits and the ethereal plane to exceed the physical limits of the material world. They have advanced training in melee combat techniques, and their mastery wielding a weapon is envied even by the greatest fighters. Their patience and discipline can be seen when they wield their spiritual weapons, a weapon made from the shards gathered from the environment and also from the very soul of the swordsman himself.": "灵性剑士利用他与神灵和空灵界的联系的力量来超越物质世界的物理极限。他们在近战格斗技术方面受过高级训练，他们挥舞武器的技巧甚至令最伟大的战士羡慕不已。当他们挥舞他们的精神武器时，可以看到他们的耐心和纪律，这种武器是由从环境中收集的碎片，也是由剑客本人的灵魂制成的。",
	"Sometimes his weapon is the manifestation of a old spirit found by the swordsman, and who now accompanies him in his journey. In other moments, a trauma might have splitten the swordsman's soul in two or more shards that created his weapons. Or maybe, the swordsman may have learned through meditation and self knowledge to extend a piece of his own spirit to a object of the material world.": "有时他的武器是剑客发现的一个古老的灵魂的表现，而这个灵魂现在伴随着他的旅程。在其他时候，一个创伤可能将剑客的灵魂分裂成两块或更多的碎片，从而创造了他的武器。或者，剑客可能已经通过冥想和自我了解，学会了将自己的一部分精神延伸到物质世界的一个物体上。",
	"No matter which is the origin of his weapons, their bond with the swordsman turns them into the conductors of the spirits' energy in the world, making them able to use and manipulate this energy to fulfill their various objectives.": "无论他的武器的来源是什么，它们与剑客的结合将它们变成世界上精神能量的导体，使他们能够使用和操纵这种能量来实现他们的各种目标。",
	"The life of a spiritual swordsman generally consists of maintaining the natural cycle of life and death. Their comprehension of the afterlife is different from the rest, and their constant contact with the spirits usually gives them a feeling of disconnection with the material world.": "灵性剑客的生活一般包括维持生与死的自然循环。他们对来世的理解与其他人不同，他们与神灵的不断接触通常使他们有一种与物质世界脱节的感觉。",
	"Due to this, many swordsmen spend most part of their lives as lonely wanderers, away from civilization, meditating and living only with the company of the spirits. They keep this lifestyle for years, until some evil or disturb in the spiritual world pushes them into returning to society.": "因此，许多剑客一生中大部分时间都是孤独的流浪者，远离文明，冥想，只与神灵为伴。他们多年来一直保持这种生活方式，直到精神世界中的一些邪恶或干扰迫使他们返回社会。",

	"The spiritual swordsman, though resembling a {@class fighter}, {@class warlock} or even a bladesinger {@class wizard}, has a different and until now unique concept: It is a class that is deeply connected to the spiritual world, specters, ghosts and the soul. It has an intimate bond with the spiritual energies and is able to manipulate them, to the point of materializing this power in the shape of his Spiritual Weapon.": "精神剑士，虽然类似于{@class fighter}、{@class warlock}甚至是刀客{@class wizard}，但有一个不同的、到目前为止独一无二的概念。它是一个与精神世界、幽灵、鬼魂和灵魂有着深刻联系的等级。它与精神能量有着密切的联系，并且能够操纵它们，以至于将这种力量具体化为他的精神武器的形状。",
	"This deep knowledge about his own spirit and about spirits in general, the bond with its weapon and its responsability in the world are characteristics that can be explored in many ways, ways that could be impossible to explore with only a subclass. And, through this class and its subclasses, we try to bring these nuances and different kinds of bonds the spiritual swordsmen could have.": "这种对他自己的精神和一般精神的深刻了解，与武器的联系以及他在这个世界上的责任，都是可以通过很多方式来探索的特性，而这些方式只用一个子类是无法探索的。而且，通过这个类别和它的子类别，我们试图将这些细微的差别和不同种类的束缚带到灵性剑士身上。",
	"The most important aspect when creating a spiritual swordsman is knowing what bonds you with your spiritual weapons. The link between the swordsman and his weapons is what gives him his identity and defines how others are going to see him.": "在创造一个精神上的剑客时，最重要的方面是知道什么将你与你的精神武器联系在一起。剑客和他的武器之间的联系是赋予他身份的东西，决定了别人会如何看待他。",
	"Having this in mind, ask yourself before creating your swordsman: How was this bond made with your weapon? Have you trained in a order of spiritual studies where you found the balance between your physical body and your spiritual state? Have you found yourself in a hard situation and carried with you a family weapon for years, that suddenly revealed itself as a inactive spiritual weapon in a moment of trouble?": "考虑到这一点，在创造你的剑客之前问问自己：你是如何与你的武器建立起这种联系的？你是否在一个精神研究的秩序中训练，在那里你找到了你的肉体和你的精神状态之间的平衡？你是否发现自己处于一个艰难的境地，并且多年来一直带着一件家庭武器，在困难的时刻突然显示出自己是一个没有活力的精神武器？",
	"And how is your connection to the spiritual world? Do you see dead people all the time? Do you have any spiritual friends or colleagues? Or are you cursed by this bond and seek to silence the spirits in your mind?": "你与精神世界的联系又是怎样的？你经常看到死人吗？你有任何精神上的朋友或同事吗？或者你被这种联系所诅咒，并寻求使你心中的灵魂安静下来？",
	"You can make a spiritual swordsman quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strenght or Dexterity, followed by Wisdom, and then Constitution. Second, choose the {@background outlander} background. At last, choose a weapon that fits the primary ability chosen.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一个灵性剑客。首先，把你的最高能力得分放在力量或灵巧上，其次是智慧，然后是体质。其次，选择（%0%）的背景。最后，选择一种适合所选主要能力的武器。",
