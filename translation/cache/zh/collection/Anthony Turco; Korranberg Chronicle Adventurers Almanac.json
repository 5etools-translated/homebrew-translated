	"The elves of Aerenal have not always lived in harmony with each other. Early in the settlement of Aerenal, there was an upheaval that saw an entire bloodline wiped out. Allies of this family, as well as neutral parties disturbed by the unilateral action taken against an entire lineage, decided it was best to move on, abandoning Aeren's promised land. These elves sailed north to Khorvaire and found themselves integrating into the burgeoning human nations there.": "Aerenal的精灵们并不总是彼此和谐相处。在Aerenal定居的早期，发生了一场动乱，整个血统都被消灭了。这个家族的盟友，以及对整个家族采取的单方面行动感到不安的中立方，决定最好继续前进，放弃Aeren的承诺之地。这些精灵向北航行到霍尔韦尔，发现自己融入了那里新兴的人类国家。",

Few on Eberron could claim to be their equal in mounted combat.": "瓦伦纳人像他们的祖先一样崇尚他们的坐骑，甚至将马的血统追溯到他们古代英雄骑着坐骑与巨人作战。在Eberron，很少有人能在骑马作战方面与他们相提并论。",
	"Mounting or dismounting a horse costs you only 10 feet of movement, instead of half your walking speed.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can dismount it and land on your feet without using your reaction.": "骑马或下马只需花费你10英尺的移动距离，而不是你步行速度的一半。如果你的坐骑被逆向移动，你永远不会从它身上掉下来，而且你在骑马时不能被打倒在地。如果你的坐骑被击倒在地，你可以下马，并以你的脚着地，而无需使用反应。",
	"Tairnadal elves escaped Xen'drik to Aerenal along with those who founded the Undying Court, but they practice a different form of ancestor worship. Descended from the brave warrior elves who fought the giants with spell and blade, the Tairnadal believe the only way to honor them is to emulate their battles in the present day.

In either case, their unstructured and savage way of life highlights their chaotic nature.": "蝎子部落生活在无情的、致命的丛林中，有着与之匹配的气质。大多数人倾向于邪恶的取向，虽然卡尔蒂亚尔人不太可能如此，但外国人很难在第一眼就分辨出乌鸦属于哪个部落。无论哪种情况，他们无序和野蛮的生活方式都突出了他们混乱的本质。",
	"Though the savage drow of the scorpion tribes can ostensibly live just as long as other elves and drow, it is far more likely for them to meet a swift and grisly end in the wild jungles of Xen'drik. Therefore, scorpion tribe drow are considered adults as soon as they become physically capable of raising the next generation of their tribe.": "虽然蝎子部落的野蛮乌鸦表面上可以和其他精灵和乌鸦一样长寿，但他们更有可能在Xen'drik的野生丛林中遇到迅速而惨烈的结局。因此，只要蝎子部落的乌鸦在身体上有能力抚养他们部落的下一代，就被视为成年人。",

	"Unlike in other campaign settings, the drow of Eberron are considered a separate race from elves entirely, and are not a monolithic culture. Likewise, their origins do not begin with a tale of betrayal between elven gods (Lolth and Corellon are not included in the Eberron campaign setting by default). Instead, drow are an engineered race, created from the arcane manipulation of elves by the ancient giants of Xen'drik.": "与其他战役设定不同，Eberron的乌鸦被认为是一个完全独立于精灵的种族，并且不是一个单一的文化。同样地，他们的起源也不是从精灵诸神之间的背叛故事开始的（Lolth和Corellon默认不包括在Eberron战役设定中）。相反，鸦人是一个经过设计的种族，是由Xen'drik的古代巨人对精灵进行神秘的操纵而产生的。",
	"The most frequently encountered drow in Eberron are the Vulkoori tribal drow living in the jungles of Xen'drik. Most of these tribes worship the scorpion god known as Vulkoor. Khorvairian sages consider Vulkoor an animal-totem form of The Mockery, a god of the Dark Six. While many scorpion tribes worship Vulkoor exclusively and are viciously xenophobic, other tribes, known as the Qaltiar, worship analogues of the rest of the Sovereign Host and Dark Six and are willing to deal peacefully with outsiders in a limited fashion.": "在Eberron最常遇到的乌鸦是生活在Xen'drik丛林中的Vulkoori部落的乌鸦。这些部落中的大多数人都崇拜被称为Vulkoor的蝎子神。Khorvairian的圣人认为Vulkoor是The Mockery的动物形体，是黑暗六神的神。虽然许多蝎子部落只崇拜武库尔，并且恶性排外，但其他部落，即所谓的卡尔蒂亚尔，则崇拜主权主人和黑暗六神的其他类似物，并且愿意以有限的方式与外来者和平相处。",

	"Living in the ruins of their masters' fortresses, the Sulatar are more defended against the wild predations of Xen'drik than their estranged tribal brethren. As such, their society can dictate that one is not truly an adult until they have learned the art of elemental binding, something they consider impossible to truly understand without at least a century of practice and mastery.": "生活在主人堡垒的废墟中，苏拉塔人比他们疏远的部落兄弟们更能抵御Xen'drik的野生掠夺。因此，他们的社会可以规定，一个人只有学会了元素束缚的艺术，才算是真正的成年人，他们认为没有至少一个世纪的练习和掌握，是不可能真正理解的。",

	"The Sulatar clans (or 'firebinders' in the Giant language) remained loyal to their fire giant masters during the elven rebellions. They retain the secrets of elemental binding their masters taught them, making frequent use of flaming weapons and fire elementals. The firebinders consider the drow of the scorpion tribes to be savages and traitors, and the tribal drow hate the Sulatar for their continuing loyalty to their cruel slavemasters.": "苏拉塔（Sulatar）氏族（或巨人语中的'火缚者'）在精灵叛乱期间仍然忠于他们的火巨人主人。他们保留了主人教给他们的元素束缚的秘密，经常使用火焰武器和火元素。火焰人认为蝎子部落的乌鸦是野蛮人和叛徒，而部落的乌鸦憎恨苏拉塔人，因为他们继续忠于他们残酷的奴隶主。",

	"At one time, the Umbragen may have had the luxury of waiting for their young to live a century before considering them adults, just as elves do now.

	"Unlike other drow, Umbragen eyes are completely black, a visible sign of this enhanced vision and their link to the Umbra. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

In their wanderings, the Umbragen uncovered ancient lore that led them to a mystical force of darkness called the Umbra.

When communicating with a shark this way, you can innately cast {@spell animal friendship} on it at will. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast {@spell beast bond} with this trait, but only on beasts that are sharks. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Casting these spells in this way requires no components and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.": "你可以与你周围120英尺内的任何鲨鱼（巨鲨、猎鲨、礁鲨等）野兽进行心灵感应。当以这种方式与鲨鱼交流时，你可以随心所欲地对它施放（%0%）。从3级开始，你也可以用这个特质施放（1%），但只对鲨鱼的野兽施放。一旦你施放了它，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。以这种方式施放这些法术不需要任何组件，智慧是你对这些法术的施法能力。",

On the surface, it has a gasping, raw-throated quality that many land dwellers find off-putting.": "你能说、读、写普通话和萨瓦金语。萨瓦金语是你的母语，它最适合在水下说话。在水面上，它有一种喘息的、原始的喉音，许多陆地上的居民都觉得不舒服。",
	"The sahuagin of the Thunder Sea are aquatic humanoids with strong piscine features, including large mouths filled with sharp, shark-like teeth. Their underwater nation is called the Eternal Dominion, and life in the Dominion centers around mindbogglingly gigantic leviathans that sleep on the ocean floor, known as the kar'lassa. These antediluvian beasts have never stirred in their slumber, and the sahuagin build their cities on—and in—their bodies, harvesting their blood and biomatter for food, industry, and magic. Kar'lassa blood has powerful transmutation properties, and careful, ritual consumption of this primal substance, as well as other beings, is what causes sahuagin to mutate, gaining different forms and abilities. For example, the Blood Frenzy trait that sahuagin of the Monster Manual possess is a common mutation for sahuagin in the military, but not every sahuagin is bestowed this power.": "雷海的萨瓦金人是水生的人形生物，具有强烈的鱼形特征，包括长满锋利的鲨鱼般的大嘴。他们的水下国家被称为 \"永恒的统治者\"，统治者的生活围绕着沉睡在海底的令人匪夷所思的巨大畸形动物展开，它们被称为 \"卡尔拉萨\"。这些前陆生动物在沉睡中从未动过，萨瓦金人将他们的城市建在他们的身体上，也建在他们的身体里，收获他们的血液和生物物质作为食物、工业和魔法。Kar'lassa的血液具有强大的转化特性，小心翼翼地以仪式的方式食用这种原始物质以及其他生物，是导致sahuagin变异的原因，获得不同的形式和能力。例如，《怪物手册》中的萨瓦金拥有的 \"血液狂热 \"特性是军队中萨瓦金的常见变异，但不是每个萨瓦金都被赋予这种能力。",
	"The Eternal Dominion interacts peacefully with coastal settlements along the southern shores of Khorvaire and the port city of Stormreach on Xen'drik's coast, so long as their borders are respected. The sahuagin are currently at war with the elves of Aerenal, especially the underwater territories of the Valraean Protectorate that the elves seized from the Dominion. For more information about the Eternal Dominion, the Valraean Protectorate, and the eldritch kar'lassa, look no further than Keith Baker's Exploring Eberron.": "只要尊重他们的边界，永恒的主宰就会与霍尔韦尔南岸的沿海定居点和Xen'drik海岸的港口城市Stormreach和平互动。萨瓦金人目前正与阿伦纳尔的精灵们交战，特别是精灵们从多米尼克夺取的瓦尔拉恩保护国的水下领土。要想了解更多关于永恒统治者、瓦拉恩保护国和长生不老的卡拉萨的信息，请看Keith Baker的《探索Eberron》。",
	"Though sahuagin are said to worship the Devourer of the Dark Six, known to them as Sha'argon, they have several peaceful treaties with nations and even House Lyrandar. Sahuagin often act as guides for sailing vessels and House Lyrandar wind galleons as they make their way across the surface of the Thunder Sea, typically sailing to and from the city of Stormreach.": "虽然据说萨瓦金人崇拜黑暗六神的吞噬者，他们被称为沙阿贡，但他们与各国甚至Lyrandar家族都有一些和平条约。萨瓦金人经常充当帆船和利兰达家族风帆船的向导，当他们穿越雷霆海的表面时，通常会航行到暴风城，并从暴风城出发。",
	"Although sahuagin can breathe air for a short time, they are ultimately dependent on salt water to live. Due to this, most sahuagin adventurers limit themselves to underwater questing, or stick close to coastal lands. Sahuagin adventurers that find themselves needing to walk dry land for longer periods seek out magical oceanic wrap clothing that will sustain them indefinitely.": "虽然萨瓦金人可以在短时间内呼吸空气，但他们最终还是要依靠盐水来生活。由于这个原因，大多数萨瓦金人的冒险者将自己限制在水下探险，或坚持靠近沿海土地。发现自己需要在干燥的陆地上行走较长时间的萨瓦金人冒险者，会寻找神奇的海洋包裹衣物，以维持他们的生命。",

The ancient among them tell of a time when insanity incarnate threatened the natural world, the druidic orcs and militaristic Dhakaani Empire fighting to stem the tide. But in the end, they say, it was the appearance of the killoren that allowed victory, bolstering the orc and goblinoid armies with their numbers, and adding the very might of nature to their cause.": "千年前，Killoren首次出现在Eldeen Reaches的Towering Wood，此后，Killoren的人口已经减少到了曾经的一小部分。他们中的古人讲述了一个疯狂的化身威胁着自然世界的时代，德鲁伊兽人和军国主义的达卡尼帝国为阻止这种趋势而战斗。但最后，他们说，是基洛伦的出现让他们取得了胜利，用他们的数量支持了兽人和地精的军队，并为他们的事业增加了大自然的力量。",
	"Though immortal, killoren can die from violence or accident as readily as any human, and the race seems almost driven to prove this point. Throwing themselves into the most dangerous frontiers of Khorvaire to do battle with the demonic, the aberrant, and the monstrous, killoren adventurers are more common amongst their number than civilians.": "虽然是不死之身，但Killoren可以像任何人类一样轻易地死于暴力或意外，而且这个种族似乎几乎是为了证明这一点。他们投身于霍尔韦尔最危险的边境地区，与恶魔、反常者和畸形者作战，比起平民，Killoren的冒险者更常见。",

In fact, since the Day of Mourning four years ago, the number of killoren births seems to be on the rise...": "许多Killoren现在看向Mournland，渴望对造成自然界如此恶性枯萎的原因进行报复。事实上，自从四年前的哀悼日以来，Killoren的出生数量似乎在上升......",

	"Though the leaders and teachers of these traditions are usually druids, their way of life is taught to any willing to learn. Rangers are common amongst the Eldeen sects, as well as fighters who develop their skills as scouts. Barbarians who follow the path of the totem warrior are also highly respected, for they are seen to channel the wrath of nature itself through their rages. With one exception, these druidic sects will even welcome arcane spellcasters amongst their number, for the aid and knowledge they bring to a community cannot be discounted.": "虽然这些传统的领导者和教师通常是德鲁伊，但他们的生活方式被传授给任何愿意学习的人。游骑兵在Eldeen教派中很常见，还有那些作为侦察兵发展技能的战士。遵循图腾战士道路的野蛮人也受到高度尊重，因为他们被认为是通过他们的愤怒来引导自然本身的愤怒。除了一个例外，这些德鲁伊教派甚至会欢迎他们中的奥术施法者，因为他们给社区带来的帮助和知识是不容忽视的。",
	"Though living one's life according to druidic tradition does not preclude worship of a deity, those with profound faith in a religion often come to understand nature through Arawai, Balinor, or the Devourer rather than the teachings of a sect.

	"The Ashbound believe that civilization is harmful, and that it has produced the worst abomination to the natural order possible: arcane magic. They do not allow arcane spellcasters to become aspirants, and in fact are fanatical in their goal to see such people punished and their magical works destroyed. The Ashbound believe that the Day of Mourning was caused by arcane magic run amok, and blame wizards, artificers, and the like for the disgusting blight on the world that is the Mournland. Ashbound initiates are trained in {@skill Arcana}, to better recognize and target arcanists, artifacts, and magic items.": "Ashbound人认为文明是有害的，它产生了对自然秩序最糟糕的憎恶：奥术魔法。他们不允许奥术施法者成为有志之士，事实上，他们狂热地希望看到这些人受到惩罚，他们的魔法作品被摧毁。Ashbound认为哀悼日是由奥术魔法失控造成的，并指责巫师、工匠和类似的人对哀悼地这个世界造成的恶心的破坏。Ashbound的入会者都接受过{@skill Arcana}的训练，以更好地识别和瞄准奥术师、神器和魔法物品。",
	"Winter is the time of year when death covers the land. This sect, while not wholly evil, rarely has good-aligned aspirants, as they view the death of the weak and pitiful to be nature's due course. Mercy is a crime to the Children of Winter, and the brutal cycle of predator and prey their ideal. Aspirants to the Children of Winter must be proficient in {@skill Survival}, for they must provide for themselves. Those who can't will simply starve.": "冬季是一年中死亡笼罩大地的时刻。这个教派虽然不完全是邪恶的，但很少有向善的人，因为他们认为弱者和可怜人的死亡是大自然的必然结果。对冬之子来说，怜悯是一种犯罪，捕食者和猎物的残酷循环是他们的理想。加入冬之子的人必须精通（%0%），因为他们必须养活自己。没有能力的人就会饿死。",
	"The oldest sect of druidism in Khorvaire, the Gatekeepers have grown fewer and fewer in number as their teachings lose relevance. Still, they insist on the absolute necessity of maintaining their ancient seals, warding the natural world from extraplanar threats and imprisoning the horrors of a long-forgotten war within Khyber. While Gatekeeper aspirants are fewer and farther between than they once were, they are all trained in {@skill Arcana} to better identify and maintain the Gatekeeper's protective barriers and track planar movements.": "作为霍尔韦尔最古老的德鲁伊教派，守门人的数量越来越少，因为他们的教义失去了意义。不过，他们仍然坚持认为绝对有必要维护他们古老的封印，保护自然界免受星外威胁，并将一场早已被遗忘的战争的恐怖禁锢在开伯尔。虽然守门人的追求者比以前少了很多，但他们都接受了{@skill Arcana}的训练，以更好地识别和维护守门人的保护屏障，并跟踪平面运动。",
	"The Greensingers are an intensely capricious druidic sect, embodying the unfathomable whims of nature. A pleasant summer day can quickly devolve into a cacophonous downpour beneath a roaring sky of thunder clouds, only for golden rays of sunlight to pierce the darkness of the storm and herald a rainbow on the horizon. So, too, do the Greensingers live. With a strong tie to fey and the plane of Thelanis, the Greensingers do not accept any 'lay' members among their number, only teaching their ways to those capable of spellcasting, especially arcane spellcasters like fey-pact warlocks and wild-magic sorcerers. The Greensingers' philosophy is too wild and unpredictable to truly 'train' any initiates, but all who manage to follow their path eventually become proficient with {@skill Deception}, to match the beguiling and fickle nature of their peers.": "绿心人是一个非常反复无常的德鲁伊教派，体现了大自然深不可测的变化。惬意的夏日很快就会在雷云密布的天空下演变成一场喧闹的大雨，只是金色的阳光会刺破风暴的黑暗，预示着地平线上会出现彩虹。格林辛格人的生活也是如此。由于与精灵和Thelanis星球有着紧密的联系，Greensingers不接受任何 \"非专业 \"成员，只向那些有能力施法的人传授他们的方法，特别是像精灵冲击术士和野性魔法巫师这样的奥术施法者。绿心人的理念太过狂野和不可预测，无法真正 \"训练 \"任何入门者，但所有设法遵循他们的道路的人最终都会精通（%0%），以配合他们同伴的诱人和善变的本质。",
	"The single largest druidic sect in Khorvaire, the Wardens of the Wood believe in the sincere stewardship of the land. They see the stone structures and wooden homes of cities to be the natural habitat of the common races and embrace the progress and technology of civilized culture. Their efforts to protect nature revolve around the hunting of unnatural creatures, such as monstrosities and fiends, and educating others on responsible cultivation and harvesting of nature's bounty. Warden aspirants are trained in {@skill Athletics} to ensure their physical prowess, as the Wardens are capable of fielding an army to rival one of the Five Nations, and all aspirants must be able to serve as soldiers if need be.": "作为Khorvaire最大的德鲁伊教派，\"森林守护者 \"相信对土地的真诚管理。他们认为城市的石头结构和木制房屋是普通种族的自然栖息地，并拥护文明文化的进步和技术。他们保护自然的努力围绕着猎杀非自然的生物，如怪兽和魔鬼，以及教育他人负责任地耕种和收获自然的恩惠。有志于成为典狱长的人要接受{@skill Athletics}的训练，以确保他们的体能，因为典狱长有能力组建一支可以与五国之一相媲美的军队，所有有志于此的人都必须能够在需要时充当士兵。",

	"However, you must also decide what has caused you to seek a life of adventure. Opening a shop and creating trinkets is for mere magewrights, but as an arcanist, you are a genius in your field. Do you seek valuable data by testing your creations in real-world applications? Perhaps you seek to uncover the artifice techniques of civilizations long past and need to leave the laboratory behind to seek out the ruins that might be full of ancient secrets. Or is arcane science just a means to an end for you, a skill you've developed to empower yourself to achieve unrelated goals?": "然而，你也必须决定是什么导致你寻求冒险的生活。开店和创造饰品是为普通的魔法师准备的，但作为一个奥术师，你是你的领域中的天才。你是否通过在现实世界的应用中测试你的创作来寻求有价值的数据？也许你想揭开很久以前的文明的人工技术，需要离开实验室去寻找可能充满古代秘密的遗迹。或者说，神秘的科学对你来说只是一种达到目的的手段，是你为实现不相关的目标而开发的一种技能？",

	"Swordmages apply their arcane talents on the front lines of combat. While all study and learn to cast spells, they each focus their learning on how best to bend the universal force of magic toward victory.": "剑士们在战斗的前线运用他们的奥术天赋。虽然所有的人都在研究和学习施法，但他们每个人都把学习的重点放在如何最好地弯曲魔法的普遍力量以获得胜利。",
	"One hundred years of war did more than reshape the political boundaries of the Five Nations. During this time, the Last War seemed endless, and the question of how best to fight one's enemies and bring victory to crown and country were on the thoughts and lips of most concerned citizens. Generations of talented spellcasters were born, raised, and thrust into this era.": "一百年的战争不仅仅重塑了五国的政治疆界。在这段时间里，最后的战争似乎没有尽头，如何最好地打击敌人并为王室和国家带来胜利，是大多数相关公民的想法和想法。一代又一代的天才施法者出生、成长，并被推入这个时代。",
	"The result was the art of the swordmage; the practical application of magic to steel, refined from ancient traditions that could afford to be more artistic with their spell-weaving. sword magic is a narrowly focused—some would say brutish—field of magic, but preeminently effective at what it does.": "结果就是剑法师的艺术；魔法在钢铁上的实际应用，从古代传统中提炼出来的，可以在法术编织上更有艺术性。剑法是一个狭隘的--有人会说是粗暴的--魔法领域，但在它所做的事情上非常有效。",
	"To fight without a plan is to hand victory to one's enemies. Every swordmage, as a student of war and magic, develops their arcane talent toward what they believe to be the surest path to victory.": "没有计划的战斗就是把胜利交给敌人。每个剑士，作为战争和魔法的学生，都会朝着他们认为最可靠的胜利之路发展他们的奥术天赋。",
	"Though the study of arcane magic is typically thought to occur in libraries, universities, or under the tutelage of cloistered masters in remote towers, swordmages buck these traditions and seek their magic out in the world. Further, these itinerant scholars don't pursue magic for its own ends, but rather incorporate it into their burgeoning treatises on warfare.": "虽然人们通常认为奥秘魔法的研究是在图书馆、大学里进行的，或者是在遥远的塔楼里的隐修大师的指导下进行的，但剑士们却不顾这些传统，在外面的世界里寻找他们的魔法。此外，这些流动的学者并不为自己的目的而追求魔法，而是将其纳入他们新兴的战争论著中。",
	"Creating a swordmage means first deciding what kind of tactician you want to be. Though you don't select class features that concretely designate your battlefield philosophy until you reach 3rd level, deciding what kind of warrior you are—or want to be—early can help you inform your choice. Do you see yourself as a cunning, ruthless guerrilla fighter? Are you unconcerned with subtleties and seek only to get into conflict as fast and hard as possible? Are you more defensive, or do you believe supporting your comrades will grant you the most likely victory?": "创造一个剑士意味着首先决定你想成为什么样的战术家。虽然你在达到3级之前不会选择具体指定你的战场哲学的阶级特征，但尽早决定你是什么样的战士--或者想成为什么样的战士--可以帮助你做出明智的选择。你认为自己是一个狡猾、无情的游击战士吗？你是否不关心细微之处，而只寻求尽可能快、尽可能狠地进入冲突？你是否更注重防守，或者你认为支持你的战友会让你获得最有可能的胜利？",
	"Another question you must answer is where you first learned magic. Did you once apprentice under a traditional wizard, but chafed at the sedentary lifestyle? Did you learn sword magic from a mentor, a traveling warrior-philosopher that taught you everything they knew? Perhaps you enlisted in a military organization that saw your potential for spellcasting and inducted you into the ranks of an arcane knightly order.": "你必须回答的另一个问题是你在哪里第一次学习魔法。你是否曾经在一个传统的魔法师手下做学徒，但对那种定居的生活方式感到厌烦？你是否从一个导师那里学习剑术，一个旅行的战士-哲学家把他们知道的一切都教给你？也许你加入了一个军事组织，该组织看到了你施法的潜力，并将你纳入了一个神秘的骑士团的行列。",
	"You can make a swordmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity, then Constitution. Second, choose the {@background soldier} background.

	"When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.": "当你单手挥舞近战武器而没有其他武器时，你使用该武器的伤害卷获得+2奖励。",
	"You approach the study of arcane arts differently from a wizard. While they research to control the essence of magic with speech and gesture, you experiment with ways to infuse magic's arcane threads through the physical world around you. You cast spells a bit differently from other spellcasters, (see Custom Spellcasting Focus and Jury-Rigged Rituals below), but you follow the general rules of spellcasting as detailed in {@book chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook|PHB|10}.": "你对奥术的研究方式与巫师不同。当他们研究如何用语言和手势来控制魔法的本质时，你则尝试着通过你周围的物理世界来注入魔法的奥术线。你的施法方式与其他施法者有些不同，（见下面的自定义施法重点和陪审团伪造的仪式），但你遵循（%0%）中详述的施法的一般规则。",
	"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the arcanist spell list. You learn additional arcanist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist table.": "在1级的时候，你会从奥术师的法术列表中选择三个咒语。在更高的等级中，你会学习更多你选择的奥术师咒语，如奥术师表格中已知的咒语栏所示。",
	"The Arcanist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your {@filter arcanist spells|spells|class=Arcanist (KCAA)} of 1st level and higher.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.": "奥术师表显示了你有多少个法术槽来施展你的（%0%）一级及以上的法术。要施展其中一个法术，你必须消耗一个该法术等级或更高的法术槽。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。",

	"For example, if you are a 3rd-level arcanist, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell repair damage|KCAA}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一个3级的奥术师，你有四个1级和两个2级的法术槽。在智力为16的情况下，你准备的法术列表可以包括6个1级或2级的法术，以任何方式组合。如果你准备了1级法术（%0%），你可以使用1级或2级法术槽来施放它。施放该法术并不会从你的准备好的法术列表中移除它。",
	"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of arcanist spells requires time spent in contemplation and brainstorming: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.": "你可以在完成长时间的休息后改变你准备的法术清单。准备一份新的奥术师法术清单需要花费时间进行沉思和头脑风暴：对于你清单上的每个法术等级，至少需要1分钟。",
	"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arcanist spells, since your ability to formulate magic into spell effects comes from your skill and ingenuity.. You use your Intelligence whenever an arcanist spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an arcanist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "对于你的奥术师法术来说，智力是你的法术能力，因为你将魔法制定为法术效果的能力来自于你的技能和智慧。每当奥术师法术提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的智力。此外，在设定你所施展的奥术师法术的蓄力DC时，以及用奥术师法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的智力修饰。",
	"You can cast an arcanist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.": "如果一个奥术师的法术有仪式标签，并且你已经准备好了该法术，那么你可以将该法术作为一个仪式施放。",
	"When you cast a ritual, it is less of a ceremonious affair and more a scramble to create a temporary magic item to activate the spell's effect. When you cast a spell as a ritual, there is a special requirement cost to cast it; objects, supplies, and raw materials worth at least 10 gold per spell level. These supplies are not expended in casting the ritual and can be salvaged and reused for later rituals.": "当你施放一个仪式时，它不像一个仪式性的事件，而更像是一场争夺创造一个临时魔法物品来激活法术效果的比赛。当你以仪式的形式施展法术时，有一个特殊的需求成本；每一个法术等级至少价值10金的物品、物资和原材料。这些物资在施法过程中不会被消耗，可以被抢救出来，并在以后的仪式中重新使用。",
	"You cannot fulfill the material component of arcanist spells you cast, unless they have a notable cost. Instead, you use any type of Artisan's tools (usually {@item Artificer's tools|KCAA}) to construct an improvised device that produces the spell's effect, functioning as a spellcasting focus. Constructing this device is part of the casting time of the spell and counts as the spell's somatic component. An arcanist must have both hands free to construct a custom spellcasting focus.": "你不能履行你所施展的奥术师法术的材料成分，除非它们有显著的代价。取而代之的是，你使用任何类型的工匠工具（通常是（%0%））来建造一个能产生法术效果的简易装置，作为一个施法焦点。建造这个装置是法术施放时间的一部分，并算作法术的体质成分。奥术师必须有两只手来建造一个自定义的施法焦点。",
	"Your custom device can be reused the next time you cast the same spell it was constructed for, unless the spell specifies that its material component is consumed. If consumed, the custom spellcasting focus falls apart after the spell's duration is over. Reusing a custom spellcasting focus requires only one hand for casting a spell. Drawing a previously-made custom spellcasting focus and stowing it are part of the casting time of the spell.": "你的定制装置可以在你下次施放它所构建的同一法术时重复使用，除非该法术规定其材料成分被消耗掉。如果消耗了，定制的施法焦点在法术持续时间结束后就会分解。重复使用一个定制的施法焦点只需要一只手来施法。拔出先前制作的自定义施法焦点并将其存放起来是该法术施法时间的一部分。",

	"In addition, choose one field of arcane science that you have focused in above all others. Each field of mastery is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you additional arcanist spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use your Infusions when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.": "此外，请选择一个你专注于的奥术科学领域，并将其置于所有其他领域之上。每个领域的掌握都在等级描述的末尾有详细说明。当你在1级选择时，你的选择会赋予你额外的奥术师法术和其他功能。当你在2级获得该特性时，它还会授予你额外的使用灌输的方法，并在6级、8级和17级获得额外的好处。",
	"Each field of mastery has a list of spells—its mastery spells—that you gain at the arcanist levels noted in the mastery description. Once you gain a mastery spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.": "每个精通领域都有一个法术列表--它的精通法术--你在精通描述中提到的奥术师等级中获得。一旦你获得一个精通的法术，你就会一直准备好它，而且它不计入你每天可以准备的法术数量。",
	"If you have a mastery spell that doesn't appear on the arcanist spell list, the spell is nonetheless an arcanist spell for you.": "如果你有一个掌握的法术没有出现在奥术师法术列表中，那么这个法术对你来说仍然是一个奥术师法术。",

	"You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book---for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook.

You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.": "你可以从你自己的魔法书中复制一个咒语到另一本魔法书中--例如，如果你想为你的魔法书做一个备份。这就像把一个新的咒语复制到你的法术书中一样，但是更快、更容易，因为你了解自己的符号，并且已经知道如何施法。你只需要花1个小时和10个金币来完成每一级的复制法术。",
	"If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

If you have a no swordmage spells prepared that deal a set type of damage, your Spell Strike deals force damage.": "你的法术攻击所造成的额外伤害与你目前准备好的剑士法术所造成的伤害类型相同。一个准备好的可以让你造成你自己选择的类型的伤害的剑士法术，或者一个造成随机或由环境决定的类型的伤害的剑士法术，不能用来决定你的法术攻击的伤害类型。如果你没有准备任何造成固定类型伤害的法术，你的法术攻击会造成强制伤害。",

	"When you drink alchemical wrath, for 1 minute afterward you may make an extra attack when you take the Attack action on your turn. While many warriors find alchemical wrath to be exhilarating, it is not actually addictive, though it takes a serious toll on the those who drink it.

If you do, the bolt launcher does not create ammunition for the next attack you make with it, firing the loaded bolt instead.": "此外，每次你用它攻击时，弩炮都会产生自己的弹药，允许你忽略手弩的装载和弹药属性。如果你愿意，你可以用预先存在的弹药来装载弩炮（例如，如果你想用它来发射屠龙的弩炮）。如果你这样做了，手弩发射器就不会为你的下一次攻击创造弹药，而是发射装好的弩箭。",

If you are a spellcaster, you may use your Spellcasting ability for the cantrip caster's cantrip.

	"This exceptionally crafted quill has a crystal nib cut from a single Siberys dragonshard. The quill can be activated as an action, and it can be used in two ways.

While the second mode is active, the quill can be placed upon any blank page, either loose-leaf or bound. Once placed, the quill will remain upright and will produce its own ink with which to write. It will transcribe the last speech recorded in its first mode. The quill will automatically turn to a blank page if it requires more room when transcribing to a bound page. If transcribing onto loose-leaf, or if it runs out of blank pages in a bound tome, it will pause until a new blank page is placed beneath it. The quill will continue filling up pages, roughly one page per two minutes of speech, until it has finished transcribing the remembered speech.": "在非活动状态下，顺时针旋转笔尖，直到它发出两声咔哒声，毛笔的第二种模式就会激活。当第二模式激活时，羽毛笔可以放在任何空白页上，无论是活页还是装订。一旦放置，羽毛笔将保持直立，并产生自己的墨水来书写。它将转录在其第一模式下记录的最后一次讲话。如果转录到装订的页面时需要更多的空间，羽毛笔会自动转到空白页。如果在活页上抄写，或者在装订好的书本上的空白页用完了，它就会暂停，直到有新的空白页放在它下面。羽毛笔将继续填满页面，大约每两分钟的讲话就有一页，直到它完成对记忆中的讲话的抄写。",
	"Once the quill has finished transcribing, it will automatically twist the nib clockwise until it clicks once, deactivating itself. A remembered speech remains remembered until it is replaced with a new speech, allowing multiple copies of the same speech to be transcribed. From an inactive state, twisting the nib counter-clockwise until it clicks once will erase any remembered speech.": "一旦毛笔完成抄写，它将自动顺时针扭转笔尖，直到点击一次，停用自己。记忆中的讲话在被新的讲话取代之前一直保持记忆，允许同一讲话的多个副本被转录。在不活动的状态下，逆时针旋转笔尖直到点击一次，就可以消除任何记忆中的语音。",
	"This wide, black leather band is adjustable so that it can be wrapped and secured around any part of the body. In the center of one side of the belt is a flat-cut khybershard. If the excoriate's band is secured to a dragonmarked creature such that the khybershard is in physical contact with the creature's dragonmark, the creature instantly loses all remaining uses of the ability to cast a spell or spells granted by their dragonmark and cannot regain these uses if the excoriate's band is still secured to them at the end of any rest. The excoriat's band cannot be removed once secured, unless it is unlocked with a special key.": "这条宽大的黑色皮带是可以调节的，因此它可以缠绕并固定在身体的任何部位。皮带一侧的中央是一个平切的凯伯夏德。如果excoriate's band被固定在一个有龙纹的生物身上，使khybershard与该生物的龙纹有物理接触，该生物会立即失去所有剩余的施法能力或龙纹赋予的法术，如果excoriate's band在任何休息结束时仍被固定在他们身上，就不能恢复这些使用。除非用特殊的钥匙解开，否则一旦被固定住，excorat的带子就不能被移除。",
	"These items were originally commissioned from the Twelve by the King of Galifar in 428 YK, when an infamous excoriate of House Orien used the teleportation powers of their mark to burgle priceless works of art from the Vermishard Palaces of Metrol, also using their powers to elude capture. Not even the Sentinel Marshals were able to bring in the excoriate, until the first excoriate's bands were created and distributed. Today, most city guards in capitals and large metropolises have at least a couple of excoriate's bands in prominent precincts.": "这些物品最初是加利法尔国王在428 YK时委托十二宫制作的，当时奥瑞恩家族的一个臭名昭著的激进分子利用他们标记的传送能力，从梅特罗尔的维米萨德宫盗窃了无价的艺术品，还利用他们的能力躲避追捕。甚至连哨兵元帅都没能把激进分子抓来，直到第一批激进分子的带子被创造和分发。今天，大多数首都和大都市的城市卫队在显著的辖区内至少有几支excoriate的队伍。",

A single creature cannot benefit from more than one glass of goodberry wine in a given 24-hour period.": "对于那些探索哀伤之地的人来说，更重要的是，如果饮用者在饮用一杯枸杞酒后的12小时内完成了长时间的休息，他们会像完成长时间休息一样恢复命中率和命中点数（在哀伤之地的长时间休息后，命中率和命中点数一般不会恢复）。在给定的24小时内，一个生物不能从一杯以上的枸杞酒中受益。",

This magical fermenting technique is known only to one circle of druids that make their home in the Greenhaunt forest of northern Breland. Until the Day of Mourning, the wine was merely a curiosity and a local delicacy of the hamlet of Hatheril just outside the forest. Now, the yearly vintage of goodberry wine is a hot commodity with scavengers, the Wayfinder Foundation, and other parties interested in exploring the Mournland, as goodberries and goodberry wine are among the few magical healing effects that still function beyond the dead-gray mists of the Mournland. Because of this high demand among interested parties, a single bottle of goodberry wine can go for as much as 8,000 gp.": "这瓶神奇的酒是由用{@spell goodberry}咒语创造的浆果通过一个保存其治疗特性的过程酿造的。这种神奇的发酵技术只有在布雷兰德北部的格林豪特森林中安家的一圈德鲁伊知道。在哀悼日之前，这种酒只是森林外的哈瑟尔村的一种好奇心和当地的美味佳肴。现在，一年一度的佳酿在拾荒者、寻路者基金会和其他对探索哀伤之地感兴趣的人那里是一种热门商品，因为佳酿和佳酿是在哀伤之地的死灰色迷雾之外仍然发挥作用的少数魔法治疗效果之一。由于感兴趣的人对这种酒的需求量很大，一瓶好果子酒的价格可以达到8000金币。",

	"When the cord is cut as an action (AC 0, 1 hit point, immune to bludgeoning damage), the lifering is activated for 1 minute. For this duration, the lifering is affected as though by the {@spell feather fall} spell, and bestows this effect on up to four creatures, each grasping one of its four grips. Any creature gains this benefit if they begin holding the lifering at any point while it is active, so they need not be holding the lifering when its twine is cut to gain its benefits.": "当绳索被切断时，作为一个动作（AC为0，1点命中率，对重击伤害免疫），救生圈被激活，持续1分钟。在这个持续时间内，救生圈会受到（%0%）法术的影响，并将此效果赋予最多四个生物，每个生物抓住它的四个抓手中的一个。如果任何生物在救生圈被激活的任何时候开始握住它，他们就会获得这个好处，所以当救生圈的绳索被切断时，他们不需要握住它来获得好处。",

A creature falling from a higher distance may attempt to judge the right time to cut a lifering's cord. To do so successfully, they must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. If the check is a failure, the creature cut the cord too soon. In such a case, the lifering's magic properties run out 1 minute later when the lifering is still a number of feet above the ground equal to 10 x the amount by which the creature failed the ability check.

As an action, you can sense the general direction and distance all astral beacons in the network are from you.": "奥瑞恩家族在五国的每个主要城市都有一个星空信标的飞地。通过对一个星空信标的调谐，你会成为所有星空信标的调谐者（尽管这只算作一个魔法物品的调谐槽）。在这样做的时候，你会获得对所有其他星界信标的意识，这些信标存在于一个连接的网络中。作为一个动作，你可以感知网络中所有星界信标的大致方向和与你的距离。",
	"While attuned to the astral beacons, you may cast {@spell teleportation circle}, requiring no components. When you cast it this way, you must target a destination that is within 10 feet of an astral beacon, as though it was a permanent circle you know the sigil sequence for. You must finish a short or long rest before you may cast {@spell teleportation circle} again this way. Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for this spell.": "当你与星空信标相调和时，你可以施放（%0%），不需要任何组件。当你以这种方式施展时，你必须以一个在星空信标10英尺范围内的目的地为目标，就像你知道符号序列的一个永久圆圈一样。你必须完成短暂或长时间的休息，才能再次以这种方式施放（1%）。灵巧是你对这个法术的施法能力。",
	"Additionally, if you can cast {@spell teleportation circle} by other means, you may choose to target an astral beacon as above, rather than use a sigil sequence.": "此外，如果你能通过其他方式施展（%0%），你可以选择像上面那样以星空信标为目标，而不是使用符咒序列。",
	"Attunement to House Orien's astral beacons is reserved for members of House Orien in good standing, and usually includes a contractual term of dedicated 'teleport ferry' service from the individual. Unlike most magic items, any number of qualified individuals can be attuned to the astral beacons at the same time. A collective of five attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of any other individual.

	"As the fastest method of travel known to Khorvaire, the services of the astral beacon network are in extremely high demand by nobles and other houses, commanding a commensurate price. Despite the instantaneous transportation, the high demand and rarity of heirs with more powerful than normal dragonmarks makes it unlikely that an appropriately-marked heir of House Orien will be present in any given city at any time. The wait list for such transportation services varies but waiting one's turn in a teleport queue is almost always faster than travel by other means.": "作为霍尔韦尔已知的最快的旅行方式，星际信标网络的服务在贵族和其他家族中的需求量非常大，价格也相称。尽管有即时交通，但由于需求量大，而且拥有比普通龙印更强大的继承人非常罕见，因此奥瑞恩家族的适当标记的继承人在任何时候都不可能出现在任何特定城市。这种运输服务的等待名单各不相同，但在传送队列中等待轮到自己，几乎总是比通过其他方式旅行要快。",
	"When attuned to this fine bracelet, you can cast {@spell Leomund's Tiny Hut|phb} from it, requiring no components. You must finish a long rest before you may cast this spell again this way.

	"The duration of the spell increases to 12 hours.": "咒语的持续时间增加到12小时。",
	"Instead of creating a dome of force, the spell conjures a small cottage of wood or stone around you that has an area of 20 ft. by 20 ft. The structure has a single story with a ceiling 12 feet high. The walls of the structure are immune to damage.": "这个法术不是创造一个圆顶的力量，而是在你周围用木头或石头变出一个小的小屋，面积为20英尺乘20英尺，结构为单层，天花板高12英尺。该结构的墙壁对伤害免疫。",
	"The cottage has up to 2 entrances and as many windows as you wish, all of which are filled with planes of force, instead of glass, that behave exactly as the dome of force in a normal casting of Leomund's tiny hut (allowing only creatures that were in the area of the cottage when it appeared to enter and exit, are opaque from the outside but transparent from inside, do not allow spells and magical effects to be extended through them, etc.).": "小屋有最多2个入口和任意多的窗户，所有的窗户都充满了力的平面，而不是玻璃，它们的行为与普通施法的利奥蒙德小屋里的力的圆顶一模一样（只允许出现时在小屋区域的生物进出，从外面看是不透明的，但从里面看是透明的，不允许法术和魔法效果通过它们延伸，等等）。",
	"The shelter is conjured with furnishings: up to eight comfortable beds (which may be stacked two high if desired), up to eight plush armchairs, a dining table, a writing desk, a bookshelf, a mirror, and a private washroom with a covered latrine. There is a basin for bathing, but water is not provided. This furniture disappears if it is removed from the structure.": "庇护所里有很多家具：最多八张舒适的床（如果需要，可以叠放两层），最多八张毛绒扶手椅，一张餐桌，一张写字台，一个书架，一面镜子，以及一个带盖厕所的私人盥洗室。有一个用于洗澡的盆子，但不提供水。这些家具如果从结构中移出就会消失。",
	"You can set the tone of the décor, including items such as carpets, wall hangings, and other decorations. Like the furniture, these items disappear if removed from the structure.": "你可以确定装饰的基调，包括地毯、壁挂和其他装饰品等物品。与家具一样，这些物品如果从结构中移走就会消失。",
	"You can leave the structure without the spell ending, however one creature originally in the area of the spell when it was cast must remain in the structure. If the structure is ever unoccupied, it disappears and the spell ends.": "你可以离开这个结构而不使咒语结束，但是施法时原本在咒语区域的一个生物必须留在这个结构里。如果该建筑曾经无人居住，它就会消失，法术也会结束。",
	"This silver bracelet sports a tiny, dangling Siberys dragonshard. While attuned to the charm of the long step and wearing it, the range of any teleport effect you create is doubled.": "这条银手链上有一个微小的、悬空的西伯利亚龙石。当适应了长步的魅力并戴上它时，你创造的任何传送效果的范围都会增加一倍。",
	"This low marble slab is inlaid with targath and mithral. Its top holds a shallow impression roughly of humanoid shape. The entire slab weighs 400 pounds and is difficult to move. By expending a use of {@spell cure wounds} from your Healing Touch racial trait or {@spell mass cure wounds} from a Siberys Mark of Healing, you may instead cast the {@spell regenerate} spell upon a creature on the slab. When you do, {@spell regenerate} functions as normal, except the target must remain on the slab for the entire duration of the spell (1 hour) to regenerate a lost body part, even if the severed member is held against the stump. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.": "这块低矮的大理石板上镶嵌着塔格拉斯和米特拉。它的顶部有一个浅浅的印象，大致是人形。整个石板重达400磅，难以移动。通过消耗你的 \"治愈之触 \"种族特性的{@spell cure wounds}或 \"西伯利亚治愈印记 \"的{@spell mass cure wounds}，你可以对石板上的生物施展{@spell regenerate}法术。当你这样做时，{@spell regenerate}的功能和正常一样，只是目标必须在整个法术持续时间（1小时）内留在石板上，以使失去的身体部分再生，即使被切断的成员被顶在树桩上。智慧是你对这个法术的施法能力。",
	"This leather collar is studded with several Siberys dragonshards synced to the Mark of Handling. Each collar is linked to an associated magical key, a small dragonshardembedded metal disk. By attuning to the collar of the wild bond, you also attune to its paired key, though both items only count as one toward your magic item attunement limit.": "这个皮项圈上镶嵌着几个西伯利亚的龙碎片，与处理标记同步。每个项圈都与一个相关的魔法钥匙相联系，这是一个嵌入龙石的小金属盘。通过调整野生纽带的项圈，你也会调整其配对的钥匙，尽管这两样东西只算作你的魔法物品调整限制中的一样。",
	"If you have the paired key on your person while attuned to the collar of the wild bond, you can cast the {@spell dominate beast} spell at will, requiring no components—on a creature wearing the collar you can see within 60 feet. When you cast {@spell dominate beast} in this way, it has a permanent duration that doesn't require concentration, and you can target a beast or monstrosity, provided the monstrosity's Intelligence score is 3 or lower. The dominated creature remains under the effects of the spell until the collar is removed, or if the collar and key are ever more than 60 feet away from each other. Additionally, the target of the spell does not gain a new saving throw to resist the spell when it takes damage. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.": "如果你在身上带着配对的钥匙，同时与野性结合的项圈相配合，你可以随意施展（%0%）的法术，不需要任何组件--对60英尺内你能看到的戴着项圈的生物。当你以这种方式施展（%1%）时，它有一个永久的持续时间，不需要集中注意力，你可以以野兽或怪兽为目标，只要怪兽的智力分数是3或更低。被支配的生物会一直受到法术的影响，直到项圈被移除，或者如果项圈和钥匙相互之间的距离超过60英尺。此外，当法术的目标受到伤害时，它不会获得一个新的抵抗法术的蓄力动作。智慧是你对这个法术的施法能力。",

	"Each crystal theater is a massive silver-backed pane of glass, some 20 feet wide by 10 feet tall, magically linked to a crystal ball about 2 feet in diameter.

However, even with the convenience of modern travel, it is sometimes impossible to leave one's home city to view a Phiarlan play performed with its original cast (as the director intended). Thus, the crystal theater was developed to allow the house's most talented performers to reach more people.": "皮亚兰之家因举办精彩的演出和雇佣了几个世纪以来最有才华的剧作家而闻名世界。然而，即使有现代旅行的便利，有时也不可能离开自己的家乡去观看由原班人马演出的皮亚伦戏剧（按照导演的意图）。因此，水晶剧院的开发是为了让本院最有才华的表演者能够接触到更多的人。",
	"Unlike most magic items, up to five qualified individuals may attune to a crystal theater, and attuning to one attunes you to a network of five crystal theaters.

Three attuned individuals can perform a special ritual that lasts 1 hour to break the attunement of one of the remaining two individuals. (This is usually a punishment reserved only for dragonmarked heirs who are excoriated from the house.

	"While attuned to a crystal theater and touching its crystal ball, you may cast {@spell scrying}, requiring no components. When you do, you may only target the location of another crystal theater in the same network. The {@spell scrying} spell lasts indefinitely, as long as you maintain concentration on it and remain within 100 feet of the crystal ball. The {@condition invisible} sensor created by your spell may be up to 100 feet away from the crystal ball of the targeted crystal theater, and its position may be fine-tuned by you (usually to attain the maximum view of the stage at the targeted location). The massive glass pane of the crystal theater at your location displays the view from your sensor, allowing an audience seated at your location to watch a live performance put on at the target location through the surface of the glass. Additionally, all sound within 100 feet of the crystal ball of the targeted crystal theater is also projected from the glass pane of your crystal theater, allowing members of your audience up to 100 feet away to hear the remote performance as well.

This incidentally includes the entire warforged race, as they are creations of artifice magic.": "Ashbound人对奥术魔法怀有深深的憎恨。就你的圈子特征而言，如果一个咒语或魔法物品是作为工匠、吟游诗人、巫师、剑士、术士或魔法师的咒语而施放的，或者是由能够施放这些咒语的生物创造的魔法物品，那么它就是 \"奥术\"。这顺便包括了整个战神种族，因为他们是工匠魔法的创造物。",
	"You perceive the presence of arcane magic as an unclean, dark blight upon the world and its creatures. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any creature able to cast arcane spells within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You can sense the highest level arcane spell slot they are capable of casting from, but do not know the spellcaster's identity (the famous artificer Baron Merrix d'Cannith, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of arcane magic as if you had spent an action while concentrating on the detect magic spell.": "你认为奥术魔法的存在是对世界和生物的一种不洁、黑暗的伤害。作为一项行动，你可以打开你的意识来探测这种魔法。直到你的下一个回合结束，你知道在你周围60英尺范围内没有完全遮蔽的、能够施展奥术法术的任何生物的位置。你可以感知他们能够施放的最高等级的奥术法术槽，但不知道施法者的身份（例如著名的工匠Merrix d'Cannith男爵）。在相同的半径范围内，你也能探测到奥术魔法的存在，就像你花了一个行动，同时集中精力于探测魔法咒语一样。",

	"History is pervaded with the presence of oppression and tyranny. But the tales of liberation—of freedom hard-fought for and won—are always the tales that inspire the most. People yearn to be free, and paladins who take the Oath of Liberty will give their all so that others may claim that freedom. Some call them freedom fighters, holy liberators, or knight saviors, but they humbly refuse the mantle of hero. To these paladins, they fight to preserve the freedom of all people, a thing which they believe shouldn't have to be fought for, in a perfect world. They're merely putting right what went wrong.": "历史上充斥着压迫和暴政的存在。但解放的故事--努力争取和赢得的自由--总是最鼓舞人心的故事。人们渴望自由，而宣读自由誓言的圣骑士们将付出自己的一切，使其他人可以要求自由。有人称他们为自由斗士、神圣的解放者或骑士救世主，但他们谦逊地拒绝英雄的称号。对这些圣骑士来说，他们为维护所有人的自由而战，他们认为在一个完美的世界里，这种东西不应该被争夺。他们只是在纠正错误的东西。",
	"In the world of Eberron, many Paladins of Liberty devote themselves to Olladra, Dol Arrah, or Boldrei, but far more of these paladins follow no particular faith, except faith in the Code of Galifar. When it still existed, the Kingdom of Galifar was a shining example of just rule and protection against tyranny. It is said Galifar the First personally freed goblins from slavery and offered them full rights of citizenship in the nation he was forging. The Code of Galifar also guarantees the rights of all intelligent folk, be they human, elf, ogre, goblin, or gnoll, the right to life and liberty. In the current day, the reemergence of the institution of slavery with the rise of Darguun and Droaam has driven many paladins to speak new oaths, swearing by the law of a kingdom that no longer is, in the hope of a brighter tomorrow.": "在Eberron的世界里，许多自由圣骑士献身于Olladra、Dol Arrah或Boldrei，但更多的圣骑士没有特别的信仰，除了对加利法尔法典的信仰。当它还存在的时候，加利法尔王国是公正统治和防止暴政的一个光辉榜样。据说加利法尔一世亲自将地精从奴隶制中解放出来，并为他们提供了在他所建立的国家中获得公民权的充分权利。加利法尔法典》还保证了所有聪明人的权利，无论是人类、精灵、食人魔、地精还是地精，都有生命和自由的权利。在今天，随着达尔古恩和德罗阿姆的崛起，奴隶制度的重新出现，促使许多圣骑士说出了新的誓言，以一个不再存在的王国的法律起誓，希望有一个更光明的明天。",
	"Paladins who swear an Oath of Liberty are usually fiercely individualistic and chafe under conformity, so there are as many different variations on the oath as there are paladins who swear it. However, they all share the same dedication to these ideals.": "发誓自由誓言的圣骑士通常都有强烈的个人主义，并对循规蹈矩感到厌恶，所以有多少圣骑士宣誓，就有多少不同的誓言。然而，他们都对这些理想有着同样的奉献精神。",

You are very conscious to seek the input of others and consider all opinions, deliberately stepping away from positions of sole leadership and authority.": "你很清楚一个失控的自我会造成多大的伤害。大多数暴君看不到自己的缺陷，他们天生的魅力和领导能力使他们能够利用周围的人。作为一名圣骑士，你非常清楚自己与这些暴君有多么相似，以及你有多么容易在不知不觉中成为暴君。你非常自觉地寻求他人的意见，并考虑所有的意见，故意远离唯一的领导和权威的位置。",

	"A spellcaster that knows the secrets of elemental binding and knows the {@spell planar binding} spell can cast that spell with an alternate material component and produce a significantly different effect than normal.": "知道元素束缚的秘密并知道{@spell planar binding}法术的施法者可以用另一种材料成分施放该法术，并产生明显不同于正常的效果。",
	"If you have this secret knowledge, then whenever you cast {@spell planar binding} on an elemental creature, you may use a single Khyber dragonshard worth an amount of gold pieces equal to 500 times the creature's challenge rating as the spell's material component, instead of the spell's normal material component.": "如果你有这个秘密知识，那么每当你对一个元素生物施放{@spell planar binding}时，你可以使用一个价值相当于该生物挑战等级500倍的凯博龙石作为法术的材料成分，而不是法术的正常材料成分。",
	"If you do so and the elemental fails its Charisma saving throw, the shard is not consumed in casting. Instead, the elemental creature is drawn into the khybershard and completely sealed within it. When cast this way, {@spell planar binding}'s duration is instantaneous. The elemental remains bound within the khybershard until the khybershard is physically destroyed (AC 10, 10 hit points per 500 gp it is worth), which frees the elemental into the nearest unoccupied space.": "如果你这样做了，而元素生物未能通过其魅力储蓄，那么碎片不会在施法中被消耗。相反，该元素生物会被吸引到khybershard中，并完全封存在其中。当以这种方式施放时，{@spell planar binding}的持续时间是瞬间的。元素会一直被束缚在khybershard中，直到khybershard被物理摧毁（AC10，每500gp价值10点命中），这时元素会被释放到最近的无人空间中。",
	"Such a freed elemental is not under your control and does not follow your instructions. It remains on the current plane of existence it is freed into until another spell or effect transports it to another plane (such as {@spell banishment} or the dismissal effect of {@spell dispel evil and good}).": "这种被释放的元素不受你控制，也不听从你的指令。它仍然停留在它被释放的当前位面，直到另一个法术或效果将它传送到另一个位面（比如（%0%）或（%1%）的解雇效果）。",
	"A bound elemental creature and its khybershard do not produce any effects on their own but may be used as the rare component in the crafting of any of several elementally empowered magic items, depending on its nature.": "被束缚的元素生物和它的Khybershard本身不产生任何效果，但可以根据其性质，在制作几种元素赋能的魔法物品中的任何一种时，作为稀有成分使用。",
	"Arcanists who focus on mastering innovation constantly strive to create new inventions and devise better ways to use existing ones.": "专注于掌握创新的奥术师不断努力创造新的发明，并设计出更好的方法来使用现有的发明。",
	"At 1st level, you learn the {@spell improvised wand|kcaa} cantrip (detailed in Chapter 3: Character Options). When you do, you know three energy types with which to use it, instead of the normal two.": "在1级时，你学会了（%0%）咒语（详见第三章：角色选项）。当你学习时，你知道有三种能量类型可以使用它，而不是普通的两种。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you can use an Infusion to temporarily modify an object with conjured additions and attachments that make it the perfect tool for whatever situation you are dealing with. As an action, choose one skill or tool. For the next 10 minutes (and as long as you have the object) you have proficiency in the chosen skill or tool.": "从2级开始，你可以使用 \"灌输 \"来暂时修改一个物体，用魔法附加物和附件使它成为你处理任何情况的完美工具。作为一个动作，选择一个技能或工具。在接下来的10分钟内（只要你拥有该物品），你就能熟练掌握所选择的技能或工具。",
	"At 6th level, you can use an Infusion to reduce the casting time of {@spell spell-storing item|kcaa} to 1 bonus action.": "在6级时，你可以使用灌注法将{@spell spell-storing item|kcaa}的施法时间减少到1个额外行动。",
	"At 8th level, your design philosophy for your inventions becomes more intuitive, allowing creatures less knowledgeable than yourself to understand and use your creations. You gain the following benefits:": "在8级时，你的发明的设计理念变得更加直观，使比你知识少的生物能够理解和使用你的创造。你获得以下好处。",
	"—When you use an Infusion to make a Perfect Tool, anyone can benefit from the object for the duration of the effect so long as they hold and use the Perfect Tool.": "-当你用输液法制造一个完美工具时，只要持有并使用完美工具，任何人都能在效果持续期间从该物品中获益。",
	"—When you cast {@spell spell-storing item|kcaa}, any creature can activate the item to cast the spell you store in it.": "-当你施展{@spell spell-storing item|kcaa}时，任何生物都可以激活该物品，施展你储存在其中的法术。",
	"Starting at 17th level, you have the opportunity to create a singularly impressive magic item. If you have inspiration, you may use it to spend one workweek of downtime to create a magic item of up to legendary rarity at no cost and without a schema or rare component. (Your DM has a list of appropriate magic items, such as those found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. You can also work with your DM to create a brand-new magic item). You may only create one magic item this way; it is your finest invention.": "从17级开始，你有机会创造一个令人印象深刻的魔法物品。如果你有灵感，你可以用它来花费一个工作周的停工时间来创造一个不需要任何成本、不需要任何模式或稀有成分的魔法物品，其稀有程度可达传奇级别。(你的管理员有一份合适的魔法物品清单，比如在《地下城主指南》中可以找到。你也可以与你的管理员合作，创造一个全新的魔法物品）。你只能用这种方式创造一个魔法物品；它是你最好的发明。",
	"Some arcanists focus on the shaping of raw magic rather than crafting items. They have a wider breadth of study concerning fundamental arcane forces, and usually have access to more directly devastating magic. Experienced arcanists in this field can perceive the quintessential building blocks of spells, rearranging them with improvisational alterations on the fly.": "一些奥术师专注于原始魔法的塑造，而不是制作物品。他们对基本的奥术力量有更广泛的研究，而且通常能接触到更直接的破坏性魔法。在这个领域有经验的奥术师可以感知到法术的基本构件，并通过即兴的改变来重新安排它们。",
	"At 1st level, you learn one {@filter wizard cantrip|spells|level=0|class=wizard} of your choice. It counts as an arcanist cantrip for you.": "在1级时，你学会了一个你选择的（%0%）。这算作是你的一个奥术师咒语。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, as part of the casting time of casting an arcanist spell, you can expend an Infusion to alter the spell's formula as you cast it.": "从2级开始，作为施放奥术师法术的一部分，你可以在施放法术时消耗一个灌注来改变法术的公式。",
	"When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell).": "当你用一个法术槽施放一个法术，并且该法术造成酸、冷、火、闪电、毒或雷的伤害时，你可以用该列表中的一个其他类型的伤害替代该类型（你每次施放法术只能改变一个伤害类型。）",
	"At 6th level, as part of the casting time of casting a non-abjuration or non-divination arcanist spell, you can spend an Infusion to change the basic nature of the spell, changing its school of magic into any other school, except abjuration or divination.": "在6级时，作为施放非咒语或非占卜类奥术师法术的施法时间的一部分，你可以花费一次灌注来改变该法术的基本性质，将其魔法流派变为任何其他流派，除了咒语或占卜。",
	"If you change the spell's school and it requires a saving throw to resist its effects, the spell's saving throw changes depending on its new school of magic:": "如果你改变了咒语的流派，并且它需要用蓄力来抵抗其效果，那么该咒语的蓄力就会根据其新的魔法流派而改变。",
	"Strength.": "强度。",
	"Wisdom.": "智慧。",
	"Dexterity.": "灵活性。",
	"Intelligence.": "情报。",
	"Charisma.": "魅力。",
	"Constitution.": "宪法》。",
	"If the spell normally has a reduced effect even on a successful saving throw, the changed spell has no effect if affected creatures succeed on their save. For example, a {@spell fireball} changed to a conjuration or illusion spell would deal no damage if a creature in its area of effect succeeded on their Strength or Intelligence saving throw, instead of half damage.": "如果该法术在通常情况下，即使救赎成功也会降低效果，那么如果受影响的生物救赎成功，改变后的法术就没有效果。例如，一个{@spell fireball}改变为魔法或幻觉的法术，如果在其影响范围内的生物成功地进行了力量或智力救赎，则不会造成任何伤害，而只是一半的伤害。",
	"The spell's new school must conceivably be able to produce the base spell's effects. If your chosen school cannot do so (such as an illusory {@spell dimension door} that does not actually transport yourself), the spell fails, but you do not expend a spell slot or an Infusion. Work with your DM to determine what the limits of each spell school are, and how far you can stretch a desired spell.": "该咒语的新流派必须能够产生基本咒语的效果。如果你选择的流派无法做到这一点（比如一个虚幻的（%0%）并不能实际传送你自己），那么该咒语就会失败，但你不会消耗一个咒语槽或一个灌输。与你的管理员一起确定每个法术流派的限制是什么，以及你能把一个想要的法术延伸到什么程度。",
	"If you have two or more uses of your Infusions remaining, you can expend two uses in order to affect a single spell with both Arcane Alteration and Energy Modulation during its casting time.": "如果你有两个或更多的灌输使用权，你可以消耗两个使用权，以便在施法时间内用奥术改变和能量调节影响一个单一的法术。",
	"At 8th level, you add your Intelligence modifier to the damage you deal with any arcanist cantrip.": "在8级时，你在使用任何奥术师的咒语所造成的伤害上加上你的智力修改值。",
	"Starting at 17th level, whenever you prepare your arcanist spells, you may select a number of {@filter wizard spells|spells|class=wizard} to prepare as if they were on the arcanist spell list. The maximum number of spells you can prepare this way is equal to your Intelligence modifier.": "从17级开始，每当你准备你的奥术师法术时，你可以选择一些（%0%）来准备，就像它们在奥术师法术列表上一样。你可以通过这种方式准备的最大法术数量等于你的智力修正值。",
	"While you may still find the {@background Guild Artisan|phb}'s characteristics fitting, the {@background Noble|phb}'s suggested characteristics on pages 135 and 136 of the Player's Handbook work particularly well for a House Scion, with the understanding that the power and influence you have over the common people is a privilege of economic standing, rather than noble blood.": "虽然你可能仍然觉得{@background Guild Artisan|phb}的特征很合适，但《玩家手册》第135和136页上建议的{@background Noble|phb}的特征对一个家族科学家来说特别合适，因为你对普通人的权力和影响是经济地位的特权，而不是贵族血统。"
