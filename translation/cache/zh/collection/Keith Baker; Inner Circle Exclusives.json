	"The Unity of Riedra is a single political entity. It's one nation. But it's made up of eight provinces, and each of these provinces were once unique nations. Those nations were shaped by environmental factors, by religions, arcane discoveries, and most of all, by {@i planar influences}. While they are now unified—and while the Inspired work to discourage any strong sense of provincial nationalism in modern Riedra—understanding these fallen nations is crucial both to understanding the landscape of Riedra, the history of the Five Nations, and the secrets or wonders that adventurers might travel to Riedra to uncover. RIEDRA may be one nation, but you'll have very different adventures in Borunan and Ohr Kaluun.": "里德拉统一是一个单一的政治实体。它是一个国家。但它是由八个省组成的，每个省都曾经是独特的国家。这些国家是由环境因素、宗教、神秘的发现，以及最重要的是，由{@i planar influences}塑造的。虽然它们现在是统一的--虽然在现代的里德拉，启发者们努力阻止任何强烈的省级民族主义意识--但了解这些堕落的国家对于理解里德拉的地貌、五国的历史以及冒险者们可能前往里德拉揭开的秘密或奇迹都是至关重要的。里德拉可能是一个国家，但你在波鲁南和奥赫卡鲁恩会有非常不同的冒险。",
	"{@i Secrets of Sarlona} implies that the old kingdoms were fairly advanced—that they had wizards, sorcerers, divine champions. If so, why did these techniques not travel to Khorvaire? And in general, why don't the Five Nations show their Sarlonan roots more strongly? We've said that while most followers of the Sovereign Host in the Five Nations know that their faith is \"the Pyrinean Creed,\" very few actually know that this means it originated in the Sarlonan nation of Pyrine. Why have these nations been forgotten?": "{@i Secrets of Sarlona}意味着古老的王国是相当先进的--他们有魔法师、巫师、神圣的冠军。如果是这样，为什么这些技术没有传到Khorvaire？而且总的来说，为什么五国没有更强烈地表现出他们的萨隆人的根源？我们已经说过，虽然五国中大多数主权宿主的追随者都知道他们的信仰是 \"皮林信条\"，但很少有人真正知道这意味着它起源于萨隆尼亚的皮林国家。为什么这些国家会被遗忘？",
	"There's two important factors. The first is that the Sarlonan \"settlers\" of Khorvaire weren't the paragons and pride of their nations. We've called out that Lhazaar was a {@i pirate}, and it's no accident that her lieutenant Malleon was known as \"The Reaver.\" Many of those who followed Lhazaar were outlaws, renegades, or rebels of one brand or another. Later waves of colonization were largely driven by refugees. These weren't organized efforts to preserve the culture and achievements of the old kingdoms. Equally important is the fact that they {@i couldn't} transport many of their greatest achievements, which is another reason why there weren't more active programs driving colonization. Because one thing Sarlona has in greater amounts than any other continent is planar influence. Manifest zones, wild zones, reality storms, and more—Sarlona is {@i closer to the planes} than Khorvaire. This creates both threats and opportunities. Depending on their traits, manifest zones and wild zones can be extremely dangerous—but as seen in Sharn, Shae Mordai, and Dreadhold, they can also enable wonders that can't be replicated in the mundane world. Manifest zones can be a source of unusual flora, fauna, or other resources. The drug known as {@i absentia} is created using a root that grows in certain Xoriat manifest zones, while the pomow plant—the mainstay of the Riedran diet—was developed in Lamannian zones. Beyond this, the more powerful zones leak planar energies into the surrounding region. This can be tapped to produce magical effects, and can also subtly shape the personality of mortals. Creatures that live in the vicinity of a Shavarath wild zone are more likely to be aggressive—and to have an instinctive knack for developing martial skills. So the wizards of Khunan and the sorcerers of Corvagura were channeling planar magic... and when Khunan wizards fled to what's now Valenar, they found that {@i their magic didn't work there.} So the reason the Five Nations don't seem to be that much more advanced than the fallen kingdoms of Sarlona is because they had to {@i rebuild} their arcane science... in the process, creating forms of magic that are more reliable and versatile. Nonetheless, it is possible that adventurers sifting through the ruins of the old kingdoms may find rituals, relics, or spells that are a match or even superior to modern techniques... though it might take the skill of an exceptional arcanist—or a player character—to adapt these techniques to the modern style! {@i (Side note for the Arcana-proficient: the old Sarlonan style of magic—drawing on planar energies—is referred to as \"Externalist\" or \"wielding external forces.\" The most common form of arcane science employed by the Five Nations is \"Siberyan,\" and manipulates energies exuded by the Ring of Siberys.)}": "有两个重要因素。第一个因素是，霍尔韦尔的萨隆人 \"定居者 \"并不是他们国家的典范和骄傲。我们已经喊出了Lhazaar是一个（%0%），她的副手Malleon被称为 \"Reaver\"，这并不是偶然的。许多追随Lhazaar的人都是亡命之徒、叛逆者或某种品牌的反叛者。后来的殖民化浪潮主要由难民推动。这些并不是有组织的努力来保护旧王国的文化和成就。同样重要的是，他们（%1%）运送了许多最伟大的成就，这也是为什么没有更积极的项目推动殖民化的另一个原因。因为萨尔罗纳有一样东西比其他大陆都要多，那就是平面影响。表现区、野生区、现实风暴等等--萨洛纳比霍尔韦尔多出（%2%）。这既创造了威胁，也创造了机会。根据它们的特性，显化区和野生区可能是非常危险的，但正如在沙恩、沙伊-莫尔代和Dreadhold所看到的那样，它们也可以创造出在世俗世界无法复制的奇迹。表现区可以是不寻常的植物群、动物群或其他资源的来源。被称为 \"3%\"的药物是用生长在某些Xoriat显露区的根创造的，而Pomow植物--Riedran人的主要食物--是在Lamannian区开发的。除此之外，更强大的区域将平面能量泄漏到周围地区。这可以被利用来产生神奇的效果，也可以巧妙地塑造凡人的个性。生活在Shavarath野生区附近的生物更有可能具有攻击性--并且有发展武术技能的本能诀窍。所以库南的巫师和科瓦古拉的巫师都在引导平面魔法......而当库南的巫师逃到现在的瓦伦纳时，他们发现（%4%）所以五国似乎并不比萨尔罗纳的堕落王国先进多少，是因为他们不得不（%5%）他们的奥术科学......在这个过程中，创造出更可靠和更多的魔法形式。尽管如此，冒险者在旧王国的废墟中搜寻时，有可能发现与现代技术相匹配甚至更优的仪式、遗物或法术......尽管这可能需要一个杰出的奥术师或玩家角色的技能来使这些技术适应现代风格。{@i (Side note for the Arcana-proficient: the old Sarlonan style of magic—drawing on planar energies—is referred to as \"Externalist\" or \"wielding external forces.\" The most common form of arcane science employed by the Five Nations is \"Siberyan,\" and manipulates energies exuded by the Ring of Siberys.)}",
	"So what follows focuses on aspects not covered in {@i Secrets of Sarlona}: the impact of the planes and interesting aspects of the old cultures. But always remember that the Inspired have worked to suppress the old traditions. In particular, the {@b Edgewalkers} are an elite order tasked to protect innocents from extraplanar threats, and one of their major duties is patrolling the borders of wild zones. Many zones do contain deadly threats; but in other cases the Inspired don't want the locals to find ways to use the zones as their ancestors did, or to be influenced by the zone.": "因此，下面的内容主要是{@i Secrets of Sarlona}中没有涉及的方面：飞机的影响和旧文化的有趣方面。但请永远记住，启发者们一直在努力压制古老的传统。特别是，(%%1%)是一个精英组织，负责保护无辜者免受星外威胁，他们的主要职责之一是在野生区域的边界巡逻。许多区域确实存在致命的威胁；但在其他情况下，激励者不希望当地人像他们的祖先那样找到使用这些区域的方法，或者受到这些区域的影响。",
	"Note that manifest zones to all planes (save Dal Quor) can be found anywhere in Riedra. What are called out in these sections are the most common and powerful planar influences in a region, and the common {@i wild zones}. But manifest zones to Thelanis can be found in any province, for example; in the novel {@i The Gates of Night}, the protagonists travel between Xen'drik and Sarlona using manifest zones tied to Thelanis.": "请注意，在里德拉的任何地方都可以找到通往所有星球（除了达尔-库尔）的显化区。在这些章节中所指出的是一个地区最常见和最强大的平面影响，以及常见的（%0%）。但在任何省份都可以找到通往Thelanis的显化区，例如；在小说（%%1%）中，主角们使用与Thelanis相关的显化区在Xen'drik和Sarlona之间旅行。",

	"In the days of the old kingdoms, the ogres of Borunan were peerless warriors. The champions of Borunan possessed inhuman strength, martial discipline, unshakeable courage, and weapons forged in Fernian flame. Time and again, they repelled the legions of Nulakesh and the crusaders of Khalesh, and yet Borunan never sought to conquer any of its neighbors. Some might wonder why this was. Borunan is a harsh land; did the ogres never consider claiming the more fertile fields of Nulakesh? What kept their population so low that they never needed to expand?": "在古老的王国时代，博鲁南的食人魔是无以伦比的战士。博鲁南的冠军们拥有非人的力量、武术的纪律、不可动摇的勇气和用费尔尼亚火焰锻造的武器。他们一次又一次地击退了努拉克什的军团和卡勒什的十字军，但博鲁南从未试图征服任何一个邻国。有人可能会问这是为什么。博鲁南是一片严酷的土地；难道食人魔从来没有考虑过要占领努勒克什更肥沃的土地？是什么让他们的人口如此之少以至于他们从不需要扩张？",
	"It's commonly known that the people of Borunan considered their neighbors to be \"unworthy foes\" and the common assumption was that the ogres were cruel brutes who constantly fought one another. In fact, the ogres were waging a truly divine war—fighting alongside angels in an endless struggle against devils. The center of Borunan contains a wild zone to Shavarath where a fragment of the Eternal Battleground extends directly into the material plane, and the ancient ogres devoted their might not to conquest, but to defending this keep against the forces of tyranny.": "众所周知，博鲁南的人们认为他们的邻居是 \"不值得尊敬的敌人\"，人们普遍认为食人魔是残酷的畜生，不断地相互争斗。事实上，食人魔正在进行一场真正神圣的战争--与天使并肩作战，与魔鬼进行无休止的斗争。博鲁南的中心有一个通往沙瓦拉斯的荒野地带，那里的永恒战场的一个片段直接延伸到物质界，古代食人魔将他们的力量不是用于征服，而是用于保卫这个守卫，对抗暴政的力量。",
	"Borunan contains multiple wild zones tied to {@b Fernia} and {@b Shavarath}, along with multiple passages into {@b Khyber}. The forerunners of the ogres emerged from a demiplane within Khyber; tectonic activity destroyed this passage, leaving them stranded in this barren region of rocky desert and hills. Of the Shavaran wild zones, only the one—known to the ogres as {@i Gul Dol,} the Gate of War—is a direct passage to the Eternal Battleground. But the ogres built their fortresses in the other Shavaran zones, and over generations the influence of Shavarath helped shape them into fierce warriors. The origin of the oni is a secret long forgotten, but one possibility is this: just like the rakshasa and the overlords, the immortals of Shavarath cannot be permanently bound. But during their service in Gul Dol, the champions of Borunan found a way to bind defeated fiends to their own bodies—sort of an involuntary version of the process that created the kalashtar, trapping a fiend within a bloodline of ogres. Thus the supernatural powers of the oni may be tied to the essence of devils bound to the bloodlines. This could be why many oni are drawn toward evil; but the oni of Borunan resisted those sinister instincts, using the power of their defeated foes to fight alongside celestials.": "博鲁南包含多个与{@b Fernia}和{@b Shavarath}相连的野生区域，以及多个进入{@b Khyber}的通道。食人魔的祖先从开伯尔的一个半位面出现；构造活动破坏了这个通道，使他们滞留在这个由岩石沙漠和丘陵组成的不毛之地。在沙瓦兰的荒野地带中，只有一个被食人魔称为{@i Gul Dol,}战争之门的地方，是通往永恒战场的直接通道。但是食人魔在其他沙瓦兰地区建立了他们的堡垒，而且经过几代人的努力，沙瓦拉思的影响帮助他们塑造了凶猛的战士。鬼族的起源是一个早已被遗忘的秘密，但有一种可能性是这样的：就像罗刹和霸主一样，沙瓦拉特的不朽者不能被永久地束缚。但在他们为古尔-多尔服务期间，博鲁南的冠军们发现了一种将被打败的魔物束缚在自己身体上的方法--有点像创造卡拉什塔的过程的非自愿版本，将魔物困在食人魔的血脉中。因此，鬼怪的超自然力量可能与束缚在血统中的魔鬼的本质相联系。这可能是许多鬼神被吸引向邪恶的原因；但博鲁南的鬼神抵制了那些邪恶的本能，利用他们被打败的敌人的力量与天人并肩作战。",
	"In addition to being fierce warriors, the oni of Borunan forged their weapons in the {@b Cauldron}, a wild zone tied to Fernia. Their weapons weren't as well-crafted as the arms and armor of the Dhakaani, but the oni spell-smiths were able to channel the energies of Shavarath and Fernia to imbue their creations with powerful magic. While most of these weapons were destroyed long ago—not to mention being designed to be wielded by ogres and oni—legendary items or even artifacts could remain in Gul Dol, the Cauldron, or other ancient ruins.": "除了是凶猛的战士之外，博鲁南的鬼族还在与费尔尼亚有关的荒野地带（%0%）铸造他们的武器。他们的武器不像达卡尼人的武器和盔甲那样制作精良，但鬼怪的法术师们能够引导沙瓦拉斯和费尔尼亚的能量，为他们的作品注入强大的魔法。虽然这些武器大多在很久以前就被销毁了--更不用说是被设计成由食人魔和鬼怪挥舞的了--但在古尔多尔、大熔炉或其他古代遗迹中可能还保留着传奇物品甚至是神器。",
	"The ogres of ancient Borunan cared nothing for the Sovereigns or the Silver Flame. They were entirely devoted to the battle for Gul Dol. The angels of the Legion of Freedom battle the devils of the Legion of Tyranny for control of this massive fortress, which is broken into multiple rings and wings. The angels believe that the balance of this war reflects the balance between tyranny and freedom across the multiverse. Of course, this is only one of countless fronts in the eternal war between these forces, but the ogres embraced this idea and believed that in fighting alongside the angels they were fighting for freedom for all people.": "古代博鲁南的食人魔对主权者或银色火焰毫不关心。他们完全投身于古尔-多尔的战斗。自由军团的天使与暴政军团的魔鬼争夺这座巨大堡垒的控制权，它被分成多个环形和翼形。天使们相信，这场战争的平衡反映了整个多元宇宙中暴政和自由之间的平衡。当然，这只是这些势力之间永恒战争的无数战线之一，但食人魔接受了这一理念，认为与天使并肩作战就是在为所有人的自由而战。",
	"Despite the might of its champions, Borunan was easily laid low by the Dreaming Dark. The humans of the surrounding regions had long feared the ogres, and it was easy for the quori to fan these flames. Within Borunan itself, the quori sowed doubts and created feuds, shattering centuries of unity. {@i Were the oni secretly in league with devils? Was the battle for Gul Dol a pointless sacrifice?} Civil strife decimated Borunan and left it vulnerable to outside attack.": "尽管它的冠军们很强大，但博鲁南很容易就被梦幻的黑暗所压制。周边地区的人类长期以来一直惧怕食人魔，而奎里人很容易煽动这些火焰。在博鲁南本身，奎里人播下了怀疑的种子，制造了仇怨，打破了几个世纪的团结。{@i Were the oni secretly in league with devils? Was the battle for Gul Dol a pointless sacrifice?}内乱使博鲁南遭到破坏，并使其容易受到外部攻击。",
	"In the present day, the ogres of Borunan are kept from the wild zones that served as the strongholds of their ancestors, and largely kept from any form of war; they use their strength for manual labor as opposed to battle. The oni are raised to believe in a twisted form of their actual history. Riedran oni are taught that their gifts are the result of being living prisons for fiends; it is the duty of the oni to redeem the fiend within them through their own devoted service to the Inspired. Largely, this has proven successful, and the Horned Guard—an elite corps of oni soldiers—is one of the most powerful weapons in the Riedran arsenal. However, over the course of the last two decades a group of Borunan rebels has been forming a resistance movement, the Horned Shadow, that seeks to protect the ogre-kin (ogres, oni, eneko). This is still a young movement, struggling to build power while avoiding the gaze of the Thousand Eyes. It's up to the DM to decide if the Horned Shadow is entirely heroic—a throwback to the champions of ancient Borunan, who devoted their lives to defending freedom from tyranny—or if the oni leaders are driven by fiendish impulses and have malevolent goals.": "在今天，博鲁南的食人魔被禁止进入作为其祖先据点的荒野地带，并且在很大程度上被禁止进行任何形式的战争；他们将自己的力量用于体力劳动，而不是战斗。鬼兽们在成长过程中相信他们实际历史的扭曲形式。雷德兰鬼神被教导说，他们的天赋是成为恶魔的活监狱的结果；鬼神的责任是通过他们自己对灵感的奉献来救赎他们体内的恶魔。大体上，这被证明是成功的，角卫队--一支由鬼怪士兵组成的精英队伍--是里德兰武器库中最强大的武器之一。然而，在过去的二十年里，一群博鲁南叛军一直在组建一个抵抗运动--角影，旨在保护食人魔族（食人魔、鬼族、埃尼科）。这仍然是一个年轻的运动，正在努力建立权力，同时避免千里眼的注视。这要由DM来决定，角影是否完全是英雄主义的--回到古代博鲁南的冠军，他们把自己的生命献给了捍卫自由的暴政，或者鬼族领袖是否被邪恶的冲动所驱使，有着恶毒的目标。",
	"Borunan has many passages to Khyber. These could provide ways for adventurers to cross from Khorvaire into Riedra, intentionally or by accident. This could also be a vector that could bring the minions of a daelkyr into Riedra. The Edgewalkers monitor these passages, and have sealed those that can be sealed. The public is kept away from the wild zones that hold the ancient ruins of Borunan, and believe them to be the domain of foul {@i altavars} (the Riedran term for fiends). The two most powerful zones are the Cauldron (a Fernian zone in the Broken Blade Mountains and the seat of old Borunan's oni spell-smiths) and Gul Dol. Today, the majority of the Gate of War is in the hands of the Legion of Tyranny, but the angels still hold an isolated keep. Their forces include a number of Borunan sword wraiths—the spectral vestiges of the ogrekin champions that fought and died alongside them.": "博鲁南有许多通往开伯尔的通道。这些通道可以为冒险者提供途径，让他们有意或无意地从霍尔韦尔进入里德拉。这也可能是一个载体，可以将达尔凯尔的爪牙带入里德拉。边缘人监视着这些通道，并封存了那些可以封存的通道。公众远离那些拥有博鲁南古老遗迹的野生区域，并认为它们是污秽（%0%）（里德兰对恶魔的称呼）的领域。两个最强大的区域是熔炉（位于断刃山脉的费尔尼安区，是旧博鲁南的鬼魂法术师的所在地）和古尔多尔。如今，战争之门的大部分地区都在暴政军团的手中，但天使们仍然持有一个孤立的守卫。他们的部队包括一些博鲁南剑士--那些与他们并肩作战并死去的食人魔冠军的幽灵残骸。",
	"The ogres of Borunan are generally more intelligent than their cousins in Droaam, with an average Intelligence of 9. It's likely that the ancestors of the ogres and oni of Khorvaire were transported by a planar anomaly; this might explain their reduced Intelligence and the lack of any Borunan traditions. Another possibility is that the ogres of Khorvaire are a separate branch of the species—that they came from the same demiplane but emerged in Khorvaire instead of Sarlona, and were untouched by the influence of Shavarath.": "Borunan的食人魔通常比他们在Droaam的表亲更聪明，平均智力为9。很可能Khorvaire的食人魔和鬼怪的祖先被一个平面异常所传送；这可能解释了他们智力下降和缺乏任何Borunan的传统。另一种可能性是，霍尔韦尔的食人魔是该物种的一个独立分支--他们来自同一个半位面，但出现在霍尔韦尔而不是萨洛纳，并且没有受到沙瓦拉斯的影响。",

Lamannian wild zones and manifest zones have been tapped to contribute to the agricultural programs of Riedra; this includes the creation of unusual hybrids, such as the pomow plant. As the Inspired keep people out of the wild zones and work to contain their influence, plane-touched sorcerers are rarely born in Corvagura. People know what to watch for and {@i know} that such sorcerers are vessels for altavars (evil spirits), responsible for chaos and bloodshed in the days before the Unity, and sorcerers identified by the Thousand Eyes will either be killed or forced into service with the Edgewalkers.

In the days before the Sundering, the northern mountains were the domain of the Akiak dwarves, while the plains were claimed by the Hual Maleer, a loose federation of human and shifter clans.": "多尔马勒是一个由严酷的平原、寒冷的沙漠和山脉组成的地区。这是一片贫瘠的土地，只比北方的塔沙纳冻土带稍微好客一些。在毁灭前的日子里，北部山区是阿基克矮人的领地，而平原则由Hual Maleer--一个松散的人类和变异者部族的联盟--所拥有。",
	"The plains of Dor Maleer lack the resources to support large settlements, and the Hual Maleer have always lived in small communities, splitting and forming new clans when the population began to outstrip local resources. Dor Maleer contains multiple wild zones and manifest zones tied to {@b Lamannia}, but these showcase the versatility of that plane. Most people think of Lamannia as the Twilight Forest, as a plane that enhances the fertility of plants and animals... and this is a common element of Lamannian zones. But Lamannia embodies the power of nature, and that includes deadly storms, frigid tundras, raging volcanos, and more. The plains of Dor Maleer are broken up by regions of environmental extremes at odds with the surroundings. Wild zones could cause endless hurricanes, with free-roaming air elementals howling with the winds. There are vast pools of lava in the Maleeri plains, and fire elementals occasionally emerge to scorch the soil. There are also a few wild zones where the environment is more welcoming—a stretch of dense forest, an impossibly verdant valley. Maleeri hunters forage and hunt in these regions, but attempting to settle them is unwise. These zones represent the indomitable force of the wild, and resist the intrusion of civilization. Disease, accelerated decay, and hostile wildlife will all plague any would-be settlers. And hostile wildlife in these zones is quite literally a big deal. These regions produce megafauna, massive beasts similar to rocs in size and power, though they can take many forms. These powerful beasts are sterile outside their zones, and thus haven't spread. But there are tales of ancient hunters feeding a village for a month with the corpse of a mighty bear dragged from the deep forest. These wild zones cannot be tamed, but there are a few manifest zones with less extreme effects, and these were the sites of Dor Maleer's largest communities.": "多尔马勒的平原缺乏支持大型定居点的资源，华尔马勒人一直生活在小社区中，当人口开始超过当地资源时，他们就会分裂并形成新的部族。多尔马勒包含多个野生区和与{@b Lamannia}挂钩的显现区，但这些展示了该平面的多功能性。大多数人认为拉曼尼亚是暮色森林，是一个能提高动植物繁殖力的位面......这也是拉曼尼亚区域的一个常见元素。但拉曼尼亚体现了自然的力量，这包括致命的风暴、寒冷的苔原、汹涌的火山，以及更多。多尔马勒的平原被与周围环境相悖的极端地区所打破。野生区可能会引起无尽的飓风，自由奔跑的空气元素随风嚎叫。马列里平原上有巨大的熔岩池，火元素偶尔会出现，烧焦土壤。也有一些环境比较温馨的野生区--一片茂密的森林，一个不可能有的青翠的山谷。马来人的猎人在这些地区觅食和打猎，但试图在这些地区定居是不明智的。这些区域代表着不屈不挠的野性力量，并抵制文明的入侵。疾病、加速腐烂和敌对的野生动物都会困扰任何可能的定居者。而在这些地区，敌对的野生动物是相当大的问题。这些地区产生巨型动物，这些巨大的野兽在尺寸和力量上与大象相似，尽管它们可以有多种形式。这些强大的野兽在其区域外是不育的，因此没有传播。但有这样的传说：古代猎人用从深林中拖出的强大熊的尸体喂养了一个村庄一个月。这些野生区不能被驯服，但有一些显性区的影响不那么极端，这些是多-马勒最大社区的所在地。",

But the ice of Risia preserves, and time ceases to flow for creatures or objects encased in ice in such a zone. It's possible explorers could find ancient champions from the Sundering or the days of the old kingdoms—or even a frozen dragon from the Age of Demons! The influence of Dolurrh is unpredictable. The most dramatic landmark is the Final Passage. When the moon Aryth is full, those who venture into this cavern can enter the Catacombs of Dolurrh. This offers a way to recover a soul that cannot be resurrected through normal means. But the Catacombs have guardians, and the Queen of the Dead doesn't surrender her subjects easily.": "多尔马勒的山脉包含与{@b Risia}和{@b Dolurrh}相联系的野生区。在Risia区，峡谷中充满了冰，温度远远超过自然界所允许的。但里西亚的冰保存着，在这样的区域里，被冰包裹的生物或物体的时间停止流动。探险者有可能会发现来自毁灭或旧王国时代的古代冠军，甚至是来自恶魔时代的冰冻巨龙!

The Akiak duergar are thought to be a mutation resulting from generations dwelling in the radius of the Dolurrh wild zones. In addition to their sensitivity to light, the Akiak duergar have an unusually strong bond to Dolurrh. This often results in a flat emotional affect; though they aren't paralyzed by the infamous ennui of Dolurrh, the Akiak are somber by nature. Akiak duergar hear the whispers of spirits, both the voices of their own ancestors and of others who have died in the places they pass through. Largely these voices form an incomprehensible chorus. However, some Akiak duergar hone their skills and become mediums (as per the {@creature magewright|ERLW} specialty in {@book Rising From The Last War|ERLW}). All duergar can learn to channel this babel, harnessing this choir of excess thought as pure psionic power; it's by channeling this power that a duergar can hide itself from the perceptions of others or temporarily expand its mass. Akiak champions learn to wield this power to produce devastating effects. In the days before the Sundering, the Akiak pioneered the development of psionic tools and channeling devices; the hanbalani monoliths that ensure Inspired dominance over Riedra are based on Akiak techniques.": "霜刃（Paqaa）山脉是阿基亚克矮人的家园，这是一种矮人文化，产生了山地、丘陵和灰矮人。Akiak duergar被认为是世代居住在Dolurrh野生区半径内而产生的变异。除了对光的敏感外，阿基亚克族人还与多鲁尔有着异常强烈的联系。这通常会导致平淡的情绪影响；尽管他们没有被多鲁尔臭名昭著的厌世情绪所麻痹，但阿基克人天生就很阴沉。Akiak duergar能听到灵魂的低语，包括他们自己的祖先和在他们经过的地方死去的其他人的声音。这些声音基本上形成一个难以理解的合唱。然而，一些阿基亚克族人磨练自己的技能，成为灵媒（根据{@book Rising From The Last War|ERLW}中的{@creature magewright|ERLW}专长）。所有的杜尔加人都能学会疏导这种混乱的声音，将这种多余的思想合唱团作为纯粹的幻觉力量加以利用；正是通过疏导这种力量，杜尔加人可以将自己隐藏起来，不被他人察觉，或者暂时扩大自己的质量。Akiak的冠军们学会了挥舞这种力量以产生毁灭性的效果。在毁灭前的日子里，阿基亚克人率先开发了幻象工具和传导装置；确保启发者对里德拉的统治的汉巴拉尼巨石是基于阿基亚克人的技术。",
	"Dor Maleer was never a strongly united nation. The first step for the Dreaming Dark was to build a force among the Hual Maleer—causing tensions between clans and between human and shifter. Inspired champions arose within the clans, uniting them and spreading the word of the Path of Unity. The psychic Akiak proved resistant to the manipulations of the Dreaming Dark, but the quori amplified fear and conflict between them and the people of the lowlands. As the Unity of Riedra emerged, the first true Inspired offered peace to the Akiak, and paid them handsomely for their aid in creating the hanbalani and other elements of Riedran infrastructure. But once the dwarves had served their purpose, Riedra turned on them—launching a brutal preemptive strike. Survivors were driven from their mountain home and into the Tashana Tundra. ": "多尔马勒从来不是一个强烈团结的国家。梦想的黑暗的第一步是在Hual Maleer中建立一支力量--造成氏族之间以及人类和变身者之间的紧张关系。各部族中出现了受鼓舞的冠军，使他们团结起来，并传播了团结之路的话。通灵的阿基亚克人被证明可以抵御 \"黑暗之梦 \"的操纵，但 \"夸里 \"扩大了他们与低地人民之间的恐惧和冲突。随着里德拉统一的出现，第一个真正的启发者向阿基亚克人提供了和平，并为他们在创建汉巴拉尼和里德拉基础设施的其他元素方面的援助支付了丰厚的报酬。但是，一旦矮人达到了他们的目的，瑞德兰就转向了他们--发动了残酷的先发制人的攻击。幸存者们被赶出了他们的山地家园，进入了塔沙纳苔原。",
	"This harsh frontier region can't support the civic infrastructure that is common throughout the rest of Riedra. There is a single bastion city: Dar Vuleer, a port on Lake Kelneluun; this is in a Lamannia manifest zone that allows limited agriculture and exceptional fishing. The fortress of Kintarn Malin coordinates the defense of the northeastern border and also serves as a training center for the shifters of the Taskaan Legion. Beyond this, Maleeri villages are smaller and more loosely structured than their southern counterparts. There are relatively few hanbalani monoliths in the province and many villages don't have the shared dreams or receive messages from the Voice. As such, while most Maleeri still support the {@i idea} of the Unity, they are not as deeply indoctrinated as the people of other provinces.

	"Because of the sparse population of Dor Maleer, the wild zones of the province don't receive the same level of attention from the Edgewalkers as those in southern population centers. Local hunters work together to deal with rampaging megafauna, and elementals rarely stray far enough from their zones to endanger the inhabitants. The Final Passage doesn't unleash threats into the world, and mortals who enter it almost never return; so while there are a few Edgewalker outposts monitoring the region, these zones are largely accessible to adventurers.": "由于多-马勒的人口稀少，该省的野生区并没有像南部人口中心的野生区那样受到边缘行者的关注。当地的猎人共同对付横冲直撞的巨型动物，而元素们也很少远离他们的区域而威胁到居民的安全。最终通道不会向世界释放威胁，进入其中的凡人几乎不会再回来；因此，虽然有一些艾德瓦克人的前哨站在监视这个地区，但这些区域基本上是冒险者可以进入的。",

All too often these Shavaran wild zones have been the source of bloodshed or tragedy, with razor storms or sword wraiths flowing beyond the borders of the zone to threaten the lands beyond.": "努拉赫什有大量与沙瓦拉特相联系的显现区。这些是大多数古代城邦的基础，至今仍然如此；努拉赫什提供了和谐之盾的大部分士兵，甚至努拉赫什的农民也会定期进行武术演习。然而，它也有野生区，这些野生区在该地区的历史上一直是一种危险。沙瓦兰的一个野生区与被称为 \"战争城市 \"的层相连，但与博鲁南的食人魔不太一样，凡人在这个层没有任何作用。其他区域并不作为通往沙瓦拉的实际门户，但它们重现了其致命的环境。这些沙瓦拉野区经常成为流血事件或悲剧的源头，剃刀风暴或剑灵流向区外，威胁着区外的土地。",
	"Daanvian zones are less dramatic, but they are largely tied to the oppressive layers of Daanvi. The ancient capital of the Empire, the city of Nulakar, was built in a zone tied to the Iron Ward of Daanvi. While there was no direct portal between the planes, accounts suggest that more than one devil passed from Daanvi into Nulakar, and that there was a time when the Nulakeshi emperors had fiendish advisors. ": "达安维的区域不那么引人注目，但它们在很大程度上与达安维的压迫层相联系。帝国的古都，努拉卡尔城，就建在与达安维的铁区相连的区域。虽然平面之间没有直接的门户，但有说法表明，不止一个魔鬼从达安维进入努拉卡尔，而且曾经有一段时间，努拉克斯的皇帝有魔鬼般的顾问。",
	"Nulakesh was at a low point when the Sundering began. The Dreaming Dark began by firing up their imperial spirit, giving the emperor and warlords dreams of regaining their past glories. The Sundering lasted for generations, and the resurgent Nulakhesh was just the beginning of their plans. It became a tool they used to cripple surrounding nations—the force that fiercely battled the foul serpent-people of Khalesh and brought righteous fury to Ohr Kaluun. Along the way, the quori encouraged the emperors to indulge in ever-greater acts of cruel tyranny, and to work with their Daanvian devils (who were acting independently, with no idea of the role they were playing in the greater schemes). Even the stoic Nulakeshi had a breaking point; as they grew close to it, the first Inspired rose up, promising to overthrow the tyrants—whom they revealed to be working with devils!—and to lead the people on the true path of righteousness, cleansing ALL the foulness from Sarlona. Once the Inspired of Nulakesh convinced their forces to unite with the Inspired-led armies of Corvagura, the fate of the continent was sealed.": "毁灭开始时，努勒克什正处于低潮期。做梦的黑暗一开始就点燃了他们的帝国精神，让皇帝和军阀们有了重拾过去辉煌的梦想。毁灭持续了几代人，而复活的努拉赫什只是他们计划的开始。它成为他们用来削弱周围国家的工具--与卡勒什的肮脏的蛇人激烈战斗的力量，并将正义的怒火带到奥赫卡鲁恩。一路走来，科里鼓励皇帝们沉溺于越来越大的残酷暴政行为，并与他们的Daanvian魔鬼合作（这些魔鬼独立行动，不知道他们在更大的计划中扮演的角色）。即使是坚忍不拔的Nulakeshi也有一个突破点；当他们越来越接近这个突破点时，第一批受启发者站了起来，承诺推翻暴君--他们发现暴君与魔鬼合作！--并带领人们走上真正的正义之路，将所有污秽从Sarlona清洗掉。一旦努拉克什的鼓舞者说服他们的部队与科瓦古拉的鼓舞者领导的军队联合起来，这个大陆的命运就注定了。",
	"Nulakhesh has always been a part of the strong foundation of Riedra. It is the base of the Edgewalkers and the primary source of the Harmonious Shield. Its people are happy to have a cause to fight for, and to the degree that the influence of Daanvi is allowed to influence them, they are more inherently comfortable with tyranny in pursuit of order. However, the city of Nulakar is a shunned ruin, and the Edgewalkers patrol all of the dangerous wild zones. The Inspired are ever alert: they don't mind Daanvi instilling an appreciation for order in their subjects, but they will not allow other immortals to influence their people.": "努拉赫什一直是瑞德拉强大基础的一部分。它是 \"边缘人 \"的基地，也是 \"和谐之盾 \"的主要来源。它的人民很高兴有一个可以为之奋斗的事业，在允许达安维影响他们的程度上，他们在本质上更适应追求秩序的暴政。然而，努拉卡城是一个避之不及的废墟，边缘人在所有危险的野外区域巡逻。鼓舞者们时刻保持警惕：他们不介意达安维向他们的臣民灌输对秩序的欣赏，但他们不会允许其他仙人影响他们的人民。",
	"The Edgewalkers are based in the massive fortress-city of Dar Mun, which is poised between four wild zones (including old Nulavar, the Imperial Crypt, and two Shavaran zones). In addition to being the primary garrison and training facility for the Edgewalkers, it holds the finest arcane library and workshops in Riedra. The Edgewalkers are allowed to study arcane magic, and must be prepared to fight any sort of threat. The Inspired also conduct much of their planar research in Dar Mun, and there are surely many secrets to be discovered here and powerful eldritch machines.": "边缘人的基地在巨大的要塞城市Dar Mun，它位于四个野生区域之间（包括老努拉瓦尔、帝国地穴和两个沙瓦兰区域）。除了作为边缘人的主要驻军和训练设施外，它还拥有里德拉最好的奥术图书馆和工作室。边缘人被允许研究奥术魔法，并且必须准备好对抗任何形式的威胁。启发者们也在达尔门进行大部分的平面研究，这里肯定有很多秘密可以发现，还有强大的长生机。",
	"There are only a few wild zones tied to Dolurrh in Nulakesh, but they are noteworthy. The Imperial Crypt was was the royal necropolis, noteworthy because of its curious powers of resurrection. When any form of magic that returns life to the dead is used here, it only requires half the usual costly material components. In some cases the dead interred here have spontaneously returned to life, though perhaps not with the same souls they began with. Close to Dar Mun, the Imperial Crypt is heavily guarded by the Edgewalkers. The Inspired have limited access to resurrection and largely don't need it, because they simply employ new hosts; but it could be that the Inspired are working on new techniques, trying to transform this zone into a resurrection factory. The other noteworthy wild zone tied to Dolurrh is a stretch of fields known as the Gray; this region is suffused with the ennui of Dolurrh, and those who remain in it for long soon succumb to a deadly apathy.": "在努勒克什只有几个与多鲁尔有关的野生区，但它们是值得注意的。帝国地窖是皇家的墓地，值得注意的是它奇特的复活能力。当任何形式的让死者重获新生的魔法在这里使用时，它只需要通常昂贵的材料成分的一半。在某些情况下，埋葬在这里的死者自发地恢复了生命，尽管他们的灵魂可能与开始时不一样。靠近达尔门的帝国墓穴被边缘人严密看守。启发者的复活能力有限，而且基本上不需要复活，因为他们只需雇用新的宿主；但也可能是启发者正在研究新的技术，试图把这个区域变成一个复活工厂。另一个值得注意的与多鲁尔有关的野生区域是一片被称为 \"灰色 \"的田野；这个地区充满了多鲁尔的忧郁，那些长期呆在这里的人很快就会屈服于一种致命的冷漠。",

Its lords were ruthless in their pursuit of supernatural power, committing countless atrocities in their quest for mystical might. The influence of {@b Xoriat, Mabar,} and {@b Kythri} can be felt across the islands, and these powers shaped the psyche of the people. Mabar wiped away empathy, driving people to be cruel and predatory. Kythri drove constant change, a quest for innovation and endless emerging factions.

	"The people of Ohr Kaluun possessed advanced forms of both divine and arcane magic. Thanks to the influence of Kythri, they made countless breakthroughs in arcane science but would rarely maintain or preserve these techniques; thus Kaluunite wizards wielded astonishing powers but rarely passed their knowledge on to future generations.

	"Throughout most of its history, Ohr Kaluun was ruled by an alliance of Shadow Lords. In theory these were hereditary bloodlines, but in practice the title was held by whoever could claim power and hold on to it, and feuds and uprisings were common. Ohr Kaluun is well known for its {@i war mazes}, vast labyrinths that served as both fortresses and cities. Each Shadow Lord dwelled at the heart of a great maze, pursuing their own paths to power and scheming against their rivals. Each lord generally followed a different path to power, and a maze would be devoted to a particular sinister patron, whether that was a member of the Dark Six, and overlord, or an archfiend from one of the planes. While there were a few Kaluunite lords known to have actually been loved by their people, the influences of Mabar and Xoriat drove the Kaluunites to horrific excess and cruelty. If you are ever looking for an image of a classically evil cult, for people willfully embracing the service of fiends or performing vile sacrifices, there are surely tales of Ohr Kaluun that serve that need.": "在其大部分历史中，奥赫卡鲁恩被一个影子领主联盟所统治。理论上，这些都是世袭的血统，但实际上，谁能宣称拥有权力并坚持下去，谁就拥有这个头衔，仇杀和起义很常见。Ohr Kaluun以其{@i war mazes}、巨大的迷宫而闻名，这些迷宫既是堡垒也是城市。每个影子领主都居住在一个巨大的迷宫的中心，追求他们自己的权力之路，并对他们的对手进行谋划。每个领主一般都遵循不同的权力之路，一个迷宫会专门为一个特定的险恶的赞助人服务，无论是黑暗六人组的成员，还是霸主，或是来自某个星球的大恶魔。虽然有几个卡鲁尼特的领主实际上受到了他们人民的爱戴，但马巴尔和Xoriat的影响将卡鲁尼特人推向了可怕的过度和残酷。如果你想找一个典型的邪恶邪教的形象，找一个故意接受恶魔的服务或进行卑鄙的献祭的人，肯定有奥赫-卡鲁恩的故事可以满足这个需要。",
	"The influence of Kythri, Xoriat, and Mabar permeate the islands, even beyond manifest zones and wild zones. There are also lesser manifest zones tied to other planes. Every war maze was built within a particular zone, and that colored the practices and achievements of the inhabitants. Evidence suggests that both the skulks and the changelings were created in Ohr Kaluun, using magebreeding techniques that surely drew on the power of Kythri. The influence of Xoriat led them to pursue paths of magic no rational mind would conceive of. Thus, while Ohr Kaluun was known for its warlocks, the Kaluunites dealt with many different patrons; one maze might use the Fiend patron to reflect bargains with native fiends, another would use the Great Old One to reflect dealing with Xoriat, another might use Hexblade to reflect bargains with the Dark Powers of Mabar. The priests of Ohr Kaluun revered the Dark Six, but different mazes had their own unique pairings, names, and interpretations of the Six.": "凯瑟里（Kythri）、索瑞特（Xoriat）和马巴尔（Mabar）的影响渗透到了这些岛屿，甚至超越了显灵区和野生区。也有一些较小的显灵区与其他位面联系在一起。每一个战争迷宫都是在一个特定的区域内建造的，这也为居民的做法和成就带来了色彩。有证据表明，斯库尔克人和变种人都是在奥赫-卡鲁恩创造的，使用的是肯定借鉴了凯瑟里的力量的魔法繁殖技术。Xoriat的影响导致他们追求理性思维无法想象的魔法之路。因此，虽然奥赫-卡鲁恩以其术士而闻名，但卡鲁恩人与许多不同的守护者打交道；一个迷宫可能使用恶魔守护者来反映与本地恶魔的交易，另一个迷宫会使用伟大的老者来反映与Xoriat的交易，另一个迷宫可能使用Hexblade来反映与Mabar黑暗力量的交易。奥尔-卡鲁恩的祭司们崇尚黑暗六神，但不同的迷宫对六神有自己独特的搭配、名称和解释。",
	"A critical aspect of this chaotic history is that almost any mystical approach could be found in a Kaluunite war maze. We've never mentioned Ohr Kaluun as working with the daelkyr or symbionts—but there certainly COULD have been a Shadow Lord who bargained with Belashyrra. Necromancy wasn't a widespread practice in Ohr Kaluun, but adventurers could be drawn into a war maze whose lord dealt with the Bone King of Mabar, and whose mummy still rules over the deadly tomb.": "这段混乱历史的一个重要方面是，几乎任何神秘的方法都可以在卡鲁恩人的战争迷宫中找到。我们从来没有提到过奥赫-卡鲁恩与达尔基尔或共生体合作--但肯定会有一个与贝拉希拉讨价还价的影子领主。亡灵法术在奥赫卡鲁恩并不普遍，但冒险者可能会被卷入一个战争迷宫，其领主与马巴尔的骨王打交道，其木乃伊仍然统治着这个致命的坟墓。",
	"The people of Sarlona always feared and hated Ohr Kaluun. Pyrine, Nulakesh, and Khalesh had clashed with the island in the past. Fear of Ohr Kaluun was a common thread the quori used in stirring up conflict across Sarlona; on the island itself, it was easy to amplifying the existing paranoia and feuds of the Shadow Lords until it reached a breaking point. The Shadow Lords crippled one another long before they were destroyed by the combined forces of Nulakesh and Corvagura, united by their Inspired champions.": "萨洛纳的人总是害怕和憎恨奥赫-卡鲁恩。皮林、努拉克什和卡莱什过去都与该岛发生过冲突。对Ohr Kaluun的恐惧是quori用来在整个Sarlona挑起冲突的一条共同线索；在岛上，它很容易放大现有的偏执和影子领主的仇怨，直到它达到一个突破点。影子领主们在被努勒克什和科瓦古拉的联合力量摧毁之前，早就互相残杀了，他们被他们的灵感冠军联合起来。",

	"Reidra maintains a presence on Ohr Kel, the largest island of the train. Dar Kel is the sole bastion city in Ohr Kaluun; while it serves as a port, it's primarily there to monitor the area, seeking to stop or at least reduce the activities of smugglers and the Heirs of Ohr Kaluun (dissidents who seek to recover dangerous power from the ancient ruins).

	"It's thought that the first changelings were created in Ohr Kaluun, and spread to Khorvaire in a wave of refugees. Likewise, refugees from Ohr Kaluun are believed to be the ancestors of the humans found in the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes. There is only one place where the traditions of Ohr Kaluun survive: the Venomous Demesne of Droaam. The ruling families of the Demesne are tieflings, the result of magebreeding and pacts made by their ancestors. They possess the strongest warlock tradition in Eberron and have built upon the achievements of the past; however, long removed from the corrupting influences of Mabar and Xoriat, they are neither as cruel nor as inventive as their ancestors.": "人们认为，第一批变身者是在奥赫卡鲁恩创造的，并在难民潮中传播到霍尔韦尔。同样地，来自奥赫卡鲁恩的难民被认为是在恶魔荒原的腐尸部落中发现的人类的祖先。只有一个地方保留着奥赫-卡鲁恩的传统：德罗阿姆的毒物王国。恶魔国度的统治家族是铁弗林，是他们祖先的魔法繁殖和契约的结果。他们拥有Eberron最强大的术士传统，并在过去的成就上有所建树；然而，由于早已远离了Mabar和Xoriat的腐蚀影响，他们既不像祖先那样残忍，也不像祖先那样有创造力。",
	"The powers wielded by Ohr Kaluun are supposed to be legitimately dangerous and frightening.

True or not, the Pyrineans were people of deep conviction and faith. They had deep and detailed visions of the Host, catalogued in countless scrolls; as a result, they also wielded remarkable divine power, matched only by the crusaders of Khalesh.

In part this is due to unusual lumber harvested from Lamannia wild zones; Rhiavhaaran ships have always been faster and more durable than their counterparts in other nations. Beyond this, Rhiavhaaran sailors have long known tricks for finding favor with wind and water. Some of these were tied to Lamannia and a limited form of primal magic. Others were tied to bargains with the fey, whether the friendship of a minor mischievous sprite or a pact made with an archfey. But the Rhiavhaarans weren't simply merchants or fisherfolk. The influence of Shavarath has long driven them to piracy and reaving, and anyone who lived on the Sarlonan coast dreaded the sight of Rhiavhaaran sails.": "Rhiavhaar有与{@b Lamannia, Thelanis,}和{@b Shavarath}相联系的野生区域，在其历史中可以看到这三个平面的影响。罗亚瓦哈的人一直是萨洛纳最优秀的造船师和水手。部分原因是由于从拉曼尼亚野生区收获的不寻常的木材；Rhiavhaaran的船只总是比其他国家的同类船只更快、更耐用。除此之外，Rhiavhaaran的水手们长期以来都知道如何在风和水方面获得青睐的诀窍。其中一些是与拉曼尼亚和有限的原始魔法形式有关。另一些则与与精灵的交易有关，无论是与一个小的调皮精灵的友谊，还是与一个大帝签订的契约。但是，Rhiavhaarans并不是简单的商人或渔民。长期以来，沙瓦拉特的影响促使他们从事海盗和纺织业，任何生活在萨洛南海岸的人都害怕看到Rhiavhaaran的帆。",
	"Alliances with the fey were a crucial part of Rhiavhaar's culture. It was the fey-favored families who rose to power, and feuds between archfey often played out in Rhivahaar. While many of the champions of Rhivahaar could be considered to be archfey warlocks, this tradition wasn't as well developed or understood as it was in Ohr Kaluun; Rhiavhaaran warlocks generally stumbled into their pacts and only a few wielded significant arcane power. The Rhiavhaarans valued their connections to their \"cousins\", but they placed much of their faith in strength and steel. As a result, much of the benefits Rhiavhaarans received from the fey were closely tied to location—and as such, were largely lost when Rhiavhaarans crossed the seas to Khorvaire.": "与媚族的联盟是Rhiavhaar文化的一个重要组成部分。正是受精灵青睐的家族崛起，大法师之间的争斗经常在Rhivahaar上演。虽然Rhivahaar的许多冠军可以被认为是大法师，但这一传统并不像在Ohr Kaluun那样得到很好的发展或理解；Rhiavhaaran的术士一般都是在偶然的情况下签订契约的，只有少数人掌握着重要的奥术力量。雷夫哈兰人重视他们与 \"表亲 \"的联系，但他们对力量和钢铁有很大的信心。因此，Rhiavhaarans从精灵那里得到的大部分好处都与地点密切相关--因此，当Rhiavhaarans跨海到Khorvaire时，他们基本上失去了这些好处。",
	"In general, Rhiavhaarans were seen as wild, capricious, and dangerous. \"Rhiavhaaran luck\" was a curse suggesting that fortune favors a scoundrel.": "一般来说，Rhiavhaarans被认为是野性的、任性的和危险的。\"Rhiavhaaran的运气 \"是一种诅咒，暗示幸运会眷顾恶棍。",
	"While it was never as despised as Ohr Kaluun, Rhiavhaar was never loved by the people of Sarlona. Internally the Dreaming Dark exacerbated the feuds between clans. Externally they fanned the flames of those who desired vengeance for generations of Rhiavhaaran reaving, and further convinced people that the Rhiavhaaran \"cousins\" were fiends, not fey.": "虽然它从未像Ohr Kaluun那样被鄙视，但Rhiavhaar从未被Sarlona的人们所喜爱。在内部，\"黑暗之梦 \"加剧了部族之间的争斗。对外，他们煽动了那些希望为Rhiavhaaran的几代人复仇的人的火焰，并进一步使人们相信Rhiavhaaran的 \"堂兄弟 \"是恶魔，而不是精灵。",
	"Rhiavhaar serves as the western hub for sea traffic, and Dar Ulatesh is the legitimate port of entry for visitors and merchants. While the region is firmly under Inspired control, the people of Rhiavhaar aren't as devoted as their counterparts in Nulakesh or Corvagura. There is, perhaps, still a touch of fey wildness in the Rhiavhaaran character. The Edgewalkers patrol the wild zones, but they can't cover all of the manifest zones tied to Thelanis... and the various tools of the Inspired—the Voice, the dreams, the remote viewing of the Thousand Eyes—can be unreliable in these areas. Cells of the Broken Throne or the Unchained often meet in fey woods or circles of stones, trusting the ancient powers to shield them. Because of this dissident streak and the region's role as the western gate, Rhivahaar has a high concentration of soldiers and large numbers of active agents of the Thousand Eyes. The Edgewalkers and the Thousand Eyes are always watching for fey influence, and it's a dangerous place to be an archfey warlock": "Rhiavhaar是西部的海上交通枢纽，而Dar Ulatesh是游客和商人的合法入境口岸。虽然该地区被Inspired牢牢控制，但Rhiavhaar的人们并不像他们在Nulakesh或Corvagura的同行那样忠诚。也许，Rhiavhaaran人的性格中仍有一丝媚俗的野性。边缘人在野生区巡逻，但他们无法覆盖所有与Thelanis相关的显化区......而受启发者的各种工具--声音、梦境、千里眼的远程观察--在这些地区可能并不可靠。破碎王座的细胞或未被囚禁的细胞经常在翡冷翠森林或石头圈里聚会，相信古老的力量会保护他们。由于这种持不同政见者的倾向和该地区作为西门的作用，瑞瓦哈尔有大量的士兵和大量活跃的千里眼特工。边缘人和千里眼一直在监视着费伊的影响，作为一个大法师，这里是一个危险的地方。",
	"The Inspired continue to harvest lumber from a few of the Lammanian wild zones, though these zones can produce many dangers. Many of the region's wild zones are on the coast and extend into the water. Sailors who don't know the region can run afoul of endless storms, megafauna sharks, fey curses, and other threats. ": "启发者们继续从兰曼尼亚的一些野生区域采伐木材，尽管这些区域会产生许多危险。该地区的许多野生区都在海岸上，并延伸到水中。不了解该地区的水手可能会遇到无尽的风暴、巨型动物鲨鱼、妖怪的诅咒和其他威胁。",
	"The Inspired and the Edgewalkers have been largely successful in containing the influence of the archfey associated with the Rhiavhaaran wild zones. However, this is a point of frustration for these fey, many of who yearn to see their stories told once more and who want revenge against the Inspired who have humiliated them. This could drive an adventure—as the player characters could enter Riedra through Thelanis—or just be a source of unexpected assistance. ": "鼓舞者和边缘行者在很大程度上成功地遏制了与里亚夫哈兰荒野地区有关的大法师的影响。然而，这也是这些费伊人的一个挫折点，他们中的许多人都渴望看到自己的故事再次被讲述，并希望向羞辱过他们的鼓舞者复仇。这可能会推动一场冒险--因为玩家角色可以通过Thelanis进入Riedra，或者只是一个意外的援助来源。",
	"In my {@link last|http://keith-baker.com/dm-nobility/} {@link two|http://keith-baker.com/ifaq-nobleq/} articles, I've talked about the nobility of Galifar in broad terms. Here, I want to tell the tale of a few specific members of the royal family—kings, queens, and princes whose deeds are still celebrated or cursed in the present day. I haven't set dates to any of them; while Cyre and Galifar the Dark are already set in canon, part of the point is that these others can be dropped into the untold history of Galifar wherever you need them to be. I've suggested that the Sun Queen inspired Tira Miron, but was she the daughter of Galifar the Dark, or was she still alive when Tira first took up her sword? The main point of these characters is that these are examples of what the rulers of Galifar could be: scholars, paladins, tieflings, traitors. Which each, I've tried to suggest ways that their stories could matter—how adventurers might encounter their relics or tales in the present day.": "在我的{@link last|http://keith-baker.com/dm-nobility/}{@link two|http://keith-baker.com/ifaq-nobleq/}文章中，我已经广泛地谈到了加利法尔的贵族。在这里，我想讲述皇室家族中几个具体成员的故事--国王、王后和王子，他们的事迹在今天仍然被人称颂或诅咒。我没有为他们中的任何一个设定日期；虽然赛尔和黑暗的加利法尔已经被设定为正统，但部分观点是，这些其他人可以在你需要他们的地方被放入加利法尔的不为人知的历史。我曾建议太阳女王给提拉-米隆带来灵感，但她是黑暗加利法尔的女儿，还是提拉第一次拿起剑时她还活着？这些人物的主要观点是，他们是加利法尔的统治者可能是的例子：学者、圣骑士、盗贼、叛徒。对于每一个人物，我都试图提出他们的故事可能涉及的方式--冒险者在今天可能遇到他们的遗物或故事。",
	"Casual students of history may be confused by contradictory accounts of the namesake of Cyre. In some accounts Cyre was Galifar's oldest daughter, a mere minute beyond her twin sister Aundair. In others, Cyre is described as the youngest son of Galifar I, who ruled as king after his father stepped down. Both accounts are true; it was Princess Cyre whose vision of unity shaped her father's kingdom, and King Cyre who ascended to his throne.": "对历史不感兴趣的学生可能会被有关赛尔名字的相互矛盾的说法所迷惑。在一些说法中，赛尔是加利法尔的大女儿，比她的双胞胎妹妹昂代尔（Aundair）仅多出一分钟。在另一些说法中，赛尔被描述为加利法尔一世的小儿子，他在父亲下台后作为国王统治。这两种说法都是真实的；正是赛尔公主的团结愿景塑造了她父亲的王国，而赛尔国王则登上了他的王位。",
	"The twins Aundair and Cyre were the most mystically gifted of the Wynarns. Aundair specialized in evocation and conjuration; she negotiated with celestials and fiends, and bought down her enemies with storm and fire. Cyre was devoted to divination, illusion, and transmutation. Her interest was always in understanding the true nature of a thing... and exploring the ways it could be expressed. Where Aundair was bold and often reckless, Cyre was thoughtful and empathetic. Cyre's motto is {@i \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create,\"} and it was her motto before it was the nation's. She sought to {@i understand} the people of the Five Nations, and it was her vision of all five working together—of harnessing the best in all of them—that drove the development of her nation and the foundation of Galifar.": "双胞胎Aundair和Cyre是怀纳恩家族中最有神秘天赋的人。昂代尔擅长召唤和施法；她与天人和魔鬼谈判，用风暴和火焰收买她的敌人。赛尔致力于占卜、幻术和转化。她的兴趣总是在了解事物的真正本质......并探索它可以被表达的方式。Aundair是大胆的，经常是鲁莽的，而Cyre是深思熟虑的，有同情心的。赛尔的座右铭是（%0%），在成为国家的座右铭之前，这是她的座右铭。她寻求{@i understand}五国人民，正是她对五国人民共同合作的愿景--利用他们所有人的优点--推动了她的国家发展和加利法尔的建立。",
	"Cyre's mastery of transmutation was unprecedented in the Five Nations. Their greatest creation was {@i Cyre's Mantle}, which used principles of transmutation and divination both to alter the form of the wearer and imbue them with new knowledge. Cyre didn't use the {@i Mantle} as a disguise, but rather used it to create unique personas reflecting different  aspects of their identity. Their subjects grew used to \"The Five Faces of Cyre,\" and Cyre considered each to be as much their true face as the one they were born with; few who knew Cyre were surprised or disappointed that they chose to rule as a king, using a confident, decisive persona that embodied their strongest leadership qualities. After their coronation, Cyre used the {@i Mantle} less often; King Cyre wanted the people to have a clear and consistent image of their king, only using their other personas in private or with close advisors.": "赛尔对转化的掌握在五国中是史无前例的。他们最伟大的创造是{@i Cyre's Mantle}，它使用转化和占卜的原理来改变佩戴者的形态，并给他们灌输新的知识。赛尔并没有把{@i Mantle}作为一种伪装，而是用它来创造独特的角色，反映他们身份的不同方面。他们的臣民逐渐习惯了 \"赛尔的五张脸\"，赛尔认为每张脸都和他们出生时的脸一样是他们的真面目；很少有认识赛尔的人对他们选择作为国王统治感到惊讶或失望，他们使用自信、果断的角色，体现了他们最强的领导素质。在他们加冕之后，赛尔较少使用{@i Mantle}；赛尔国王希望人民对他们的国王有一个清晰而一致的形象，只在私下或与亲密顾问一起使用他们的其他角色。",
	"Those who are familiar with changeling cultures may recognize elements of traveler philosophy in Cyre's use of personas. While the truth is buried beneath centuries, some tales say that Cyre had great respect for the Children of Jes and helped them establish havens across the united kingdom. In some of these tales, Cyre didn't actually create {@i Cyre's Mantle}, but rather received it as a gift from the Traveler. Whatever the truth, both {@i Cyre's Mantle} and a number of their advisors disappeared after the king's natural death; there have been a number of tales of the {@i Mantle} being used at various points in history, but its current location remains a mystery.": "熟悉变种人文化的人可能会从赛尔对角色的使用中认识到旅行者哲学的元素。虽然真相被埋藏在几个世纪之下，但有些故事说Cyre非常尊重Jes的孩子，并帮助他们在整个联合王国建立避难所。在其中一些故事中，赛尔实际上并没有创造{@i Cyre's Mantle}，而是作为旅行者的礼物接受了它。不管真相如何，在国王自然死亡后，{@i Cyre's Mantle}和他们的一些顾问都消失了；在历史上的不同时期，有许多关于{@i Mantle}的传说，但它目前的位置仍然是个谜。",
	"Dyran ir'Wynarn was a Khoravar born of the union of the King of Galifar and the Duchess of the Duskwood. As a child, he spent a great deal of time on his mother's estates; some whispered that he was visiting his grandmother, an archfey whose domain lay on the other side of the Duskwood. Whatever the truth of this, there is no question that Dyran was remarkable. When he was appointed as governing Prince of Aundair, he was an Enchanter of the Third Circle; many believe that his true power was greater still but that he choose to conceal it. He was a brilliant orator, blending natural charisma and supernatural gifts. He strengthened the Arcane College considerably during his reign, but his life's work was tracking down and identifying Thelanian manifest zones, following up on obscure tales and walking forgotten paths. Aundairian bards know countless tales of Clever Dyran—how he won the crown of the Count of the Barren Marches, danced with Lady Perilous in the Palace of the Moon, and stole arcane secrets from the Mother of Invention. Some say that he surely could have stolen the throne of Galifar from his human brother Dolan, but that Clever Dyran had no desire to rule. Prince Dyran disappeared when he was 111 years old; the tales say that he surely went to claim a seat in the Palace of the Moon, and that he might be there still today.": "Dyran ir'Wynarn是Khoravar人，由Galifar的国王和Duskwood的公爵夫人结合而生。小时候，他花了很多时间在他母亲的庄园里；有人小声说，他是去看望他的祖母，一位大法官，他的领地就在Duskwood的另一边。无论真相如何，毫无疑问，迪兰是很了不起的。当他被任命为昂代尔的管理王子时，他是一个第三圈的魔法师；许多人认为他的真正力量更强大，但他选择了隐藏它。他是一个出色的演说家，融合了自然魅力和超自然的天赋。他在位期间大大加强了奥术学院的实力，但他一生的工作是追踪和识别Thelanian的显灵区，跟踪晦涩的故事和走过被遗忘的道路。昂代尔人的吟游诗人知道无数关于聪明的迪兰的故事--他是如何赢得贫瘠牧场伯爵的王冠的，在月宫中与霹雳夫人共舞，并从发明之母那里偷取奥术秘密的。有人说，他肯定可以从他的人类兄弟多兰手中窃取加利法尔的王位，但聪明的迪兰并没有统治的欲望。迪兰王子在111岁时失踪了；传说他肯定是去要求在月宫中占有一席之地，而且他可能今天还在那里。",
	"While the details aren't known to history, Prince Dyran negotiated with many of the archfey of Thelanis, both on his own behalf and for the good of his nation. Dyran's journals could provide insight both into the location of Thelanian manifest zones and secrets of the archfey; perhaps he made bargains that could still be invoked today. His vaults surely included treasures of Thelanis, and an unusual trinket could turn out to be a fey heirloom of Clever Dyran.": "虽然细节不为历史所知，但Dyran王子为了自己和国家的利益，与Thelanis的许多大法官进行了谈判。Dyran的日记可以提供关于Thelanian宣言区的位置和大法官的秘密的见解；也许他做的交易今天仍然可以被引用。他的金库里肯定有Thelanis的珍宝，而一个不寻常的饰品可能是聪明的Dyran的传家宝。",
	"Young Galifar was born in Vult, on the darkest night of Long Shadows. The common story says that both his mother and the attending Jorasco chirurgeon were found dead in the birthing room, the silent child still cradled in his mother's arms. The servants whispered that the child was cursed, that plants withered in his shadow. But it seemed Galifar could sense those who carried death in their heart; when a would-be assassin sought to kill King Cyre, the boy called out the killer's name and the assassin fell dead at Cyre's feet. While others still feared the prince, Cyre embraced him and the two were inseparable until the King's death.": "年轻的加利法尔出生在武尔特，在长影最黑暗的夜晚。一般的说法是，他的母亲和主治的乔拉斯科医生都被发现死在产房里，那个沉默的孩子还在他母亲的怀里摇晃着。仆人们低声说，这个孩子被诅咒了，植物在他的阴影下枯萎。但似乎加里法尔能感觉到那些心里装着死亡的人；当一个可能的刺客想要杀死赛尔国王时，这个男孩叫出了杀手的名字，刺客就死在了赛尔的脚下。当其他人仍然惧怕这位王子时，赛尔拥抱了他，两人形影不离，直到国王去世。",
	"This is a popular story, but as with so many elements of history, the concrete facts are shrouded in mystery. Many scholars believe that Galifar II was a tiefling with ties to Mabar; but others say that the king had an aberrant dragonmark in a place easily concealed. It's said that when Galifar looked at someone, he knew exactly when and how they would die. But while it was these eerie gifts and his cold demeanor that earned Galifar his sobriquet, Galifar II was a good ruler who strengthened the bonds between the Five Nations, reinforcing the Galifar Code of Justice and overhauling the calendar; it was Galifar the Dark who established the {@i Year of the Kingdom} still used today.": "这是一个很受欢迎的故事，但就像历史上的许多元素一样，具体的事实被笼罩在神秘之中。许多学者认为，加利法尔二世是一个与马巴尔有联系的盗贼；但也有人说，国王在一个容易隐藏的地方有一个反常的龙纹。据说，当加利法尔看着某人时，他能准确地知道他们何时和如何死亡。但是，虽然是这些阴森的天赋和他冷酷的举止为加利法尔赢得了他的恶名，但加利法尔二世是一个好的统治者，他加强了五国之间的联系，强化了加利法尔正义法则，并全面修改了日历；正是黑暗的加利法尔建立了至今仍在使用的（%0%）。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks were rarer in Galifar II's time than in the present day, and if Galifar's \"gift\" was a dragonmark, it was a strong one. If Galifar the Dark did have an aberrant dragonmark, he may have done research into these marks during his reign; it's possible that he sheltered other aberrants, or developed focus items for his or other aberrant marks. If aberrant-marked adventurers in the present day could find conclusive evidence of Galifar's mark—or a cache of journals or tools—it could have interesting repercussions for House Tarkanan and the Twelve.": "在加利法尔二世的时代，反常的龙印比现在更罕见，如果加利法尔的 \"礼物 \"是龙印，那它就是一个强大的龙印。如果黑暗的加里法尔确实有一个反常的龙印，他可能在统治期间对这些龙印进行了研究；他有可能庇护了其他的反常者，或者为他或其他的反常龙印开发了重点项目。如果现在的反常印记的冒险者能够找到加里法尔印记的确凿证据，或者找到日记或工具的藏匿处，就会对塔卡南家族和十二门徒产生有趣的影响。",
	"Hala ir'Wynarn never expected to be Queen of Galifar. The fourth child of the king, she was appointed Princess of Thrane. She devoted herself to Dol Arrah, studying the arts of war and vowing to live a virtuous life. When cruel fate slew her older siblings and placed her on the throne, she began her reign by purging corrupt elements within the royal court and the Army of Galifar. She quickly turned her attention to the ongoing conflicts in southern Cyre and western Breland, and insisted on leading campaigns against ogres and worgs. She was celebrated by the common folk of Breland and advanced the borders of the nation. Stories say that it was her younger brother who convinced her to pursue a grander threat than any mere ogre or troll. At that time, Sora Maenya had been credited with the destruction of a number of small villages on the edge of Aundair, and the Sun Queen led an elite force of trackers and hunters into the Towering Wood to finally end this threat. Hala was only 24 when she led her troops into the Wood, and had yet to produce an heir; her brother claimed the throne when she was finally declared to be dead.": "哈拉-伊尔-维纳恩从未想过要成为加利法尔的女王。作为国王的第四个孩子，她被任命为瑟兰的公主。她把自己献给了多尔-阿拉，学习战争的艺术，并发誓要过上有道德的生活。当残酷的命运杀死了她的兄妹并将她推上王位时，她开始了她的统治，清除了王室和加利法尔军队中的腐败分子。她很快就把注意力转向了赛尔南部和布雷兰西部的持续冲突，并坚持领导对食人魔和虫族的作战。她受到了布雷兰德的普通民众的赞誉，并推进了国家的边界。故事说，是她的弟弟说服了她去追求比任何单纯的食人魔或巨魔更大的威胁。当时，索拉-迈尼亚被认为破坏了昂代尔边缘的一些小村庄，太阳女王带领一支由追踪者和猎人组成的精锐部队进入塔林，最终结束了这一威胁。哈拉率领部队进入森林时只有24岁，而且还没有产生继承人；当她最终被宣布死亡时，她的弟弟声称拥有王位。",
	"Hala ir'Wynarn is a legendary champion and an inspiration for paladins; Tira Miron was likely following the example of the Sun Queen. Only Sora Maenya knows her final fate, and it's possible that the hag still has Hala's arms and armor—or that they are hidden somewhere in the Towering Wood. A gruesome possibility is that Maenya has bound Hala's soul and has the queen's skull among her trophies; adventurers could be charged to recover the relic and finally allow Hala to rest.": "Hala ir'Wynarn是一位传奇的冠军，是圣骑士的灵感来源；Tira Miron很可能是在效仿太阳女王。只有索拉-梅尼亚知道她的最终命运，而且有可能这个女巫仍然拥有哈拉的手臂和盔甲，或者它们被藏在塔林的某个地方。一个可怕的可能性是马恩雅捆绑了哈拉的灵魂，并将女王的头骨放在她的战利品中；冒险者们可能会被要求找回遗物，最终让哈拉安息。",
	"Princess of Aundair before ascending to be Queen of Galifar, Marala ir'Wynarn devoted herself to strengthening the Arcane Congress, but also to improving schools and universities across the united kingdom. Much of the common traditions of education in Galifar are the direct result of Marala's efforts, leading the people to call her the Hand of Aureon.": "在登上加利法尔女王的宝座之前，马拉拉-伊尔维纳恩致力于加强奥术大会，同时也致力于改善整个联合王国的学校和大学。加利法尔常见的教育传统大多是马拉拉努力的直接结果，导致人们称她为奥瑞恩之手。",
	"In addition to her public works, Queen Marala took great pride in her personal library. She collected tomes from across Eberron, and was known to possess rare texts and spellshards from Aerenal, Ohr Kaluun, and even a massive codex written by a Cul'sir wizard of ancient Xen'drik. The tales say that her library was hidden in an invisible tower; modern scholars believe that this was probably some form of {@spell Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion|PHB|magnificent mansion}. She died under mysterious circumstances, and her trove of texts wasn't accounted for in her will; it's quite possible that her invisible tower is still out there in the ether, waiting to be found.": "除了她的公共作品，马拉拉女王对她的个人图书馆感到非常自豪。她收集了来自Eberron各地的书籍，众所周知，她拥有来自Aerenal、Ohr Kaluun的稀有文本和咒语，甚至还有一部由古代Xen'drik的Cul's sir巫师编写的巨大手抄本。传说中，她的图书馆藏在一座看不见的塔里；现代学者认为，这可能是某种形式的（%0%）。她在神秘的情况下死去，她的文本库在她的遗嘱中没有说明；很有可能她的隐形塔还在外面的乙醚中，等待着被发现。",
	"Prince of Breland, Sarath was last in line to ascend the throne... and yet, one by one, his siblings fell prey to misfortune. In {@i The Serpent and The Crown} the playwight Miala Shol claims that Sarath orchestrated all of these deaths, that he even worked with a shapeshifting fiend to clear his path to the throne. Sarath's culpability in these early deaths is conjecture, but when his fourth and final sibling Laeran took the throne, Sarath stepped into the light. Laeran was a Khoravar, and it was Sarath who first asserted that no half-elf could claim the mantle of Galifar. Laeran was well-loved in Thrane and Aundair, but Sarath succeeded in poisoning the minds of many. While Laeran's Khoravar blood was an early pretext, Sarath found other faultlines that had formed over the centuries, amplifying these and using the anger and frustration of the people to strengthen his position. These schemes ultimately brought down Laeran and set Sarath upon the throne, but in the end he reaped what he had sowed. The fires of hatred that he'd lit continued to burn; there were uprisings across Breland, and his reign was finally brought to an end by a swift civil war led by the Archdukes of Thrane and Aundair.": "布雷兰德的王子，萨拉特是最后一个登上王位的人......然而，他的兄弟姐妹一个接一个地沦为不幸的牺牲品。在{@i The Serpent and The Crown}中，剧中人米亚拉-肖尔声称，萨拉特策划了所有这些死亡，他甚至与一个变形的魔鬼合作，以清除他通往王位的道路。萨拉斯在这些早期的死亡中的罪责是可以猜测的，但是当他的第四个也是最后一个兄弟姐妹拉兰登上王位时，萨拉斯走到了阳光下。拉兰是一个霍拉瓦人，而正是萨拉特首先断言没有半精灵可以要求获得加利法尔的衣钵。拉兰在瑟兰和昂代尔很受欢迎，但萨拉特成功地毒害了许多人的思想。虽然莱兰的霍拉瓦尔血统是一个早期的借口，但萨拉特找到了几个世纪以来形成的其他断层，放大了这些断层，并利用人们的愤怒和挫折感来加强他的地位。这些计划最终打倒了莱兰，使萨拉特登上了王位，但最终他收获了他所播种的东西。他点燃的仇恨之火继续燃烧；布雷兰各地出现了起义，他的统治最终被一场由瑟兰和昂代尔大公领导的迅速内战所终结。",
	"Sarath is just one example of the Wynarns who placed personal power and ambition above the public good. His short reign is surely invoked by the Swords of Liberty and others who say that the monarchy does more harm than good, and the poisonous lies he spread are still told by those who hate the Khoravar. A critical question is whether he was working with the Lords of Dust, as Miala Shol suggested in her play; Bel Shalor revels in the suffering of innocents, and Eldrantulku would delight in a brother murdering his siblings and sowing strife across his kingdom. It's quite possible that Sarath claiming the throne was a crucial point in the Draconic Prophecy, that securing the power of the Serpent King was a victory for one of the overlords; but did Sarath's fall undo that triumph, or was this just one piece of a plot that will finally come to fruition in the present day?": "萨拉斯只是将个人权力和野心置于公众利益之上的威纳尔家族的一个例子。他的短暂统治肯定会被自由之剑和其他说君主制弊大于利的人所引用，而他散布的有毒谎言仍然被那些憎恨霍拉瓦人的人所提起。一个关键的问题是，他是否像米亚拉-肖尔在剧中建议的那样与尘土领主合作；贝尔-沙洛尔陶醉于无辜者的痛苦，而埃尔德兰图尔库会乐于看到一个兄弟谋杀他的兄弟姐妹并在他的王国里播下纷争。很有可能的是，萨拉特称王是德拉贡预言中的一个关键点，确保蛇王的权力是其中一个霸主的胜利；但萨拉特的陨落是否使这一胜利化为乌有，或者这只是一个阴谋的一个片段，最终将在今天实现？",
