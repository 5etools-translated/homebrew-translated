If the target converses with you for the full manifesting time, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you insert in the target's mind the urge to do violence against one creature you name or describe to it. If the target sees that creature before the duration ends, it attacks the creature. If the target was already hostile towards the creature, it attacks using weapons or magic.

The revision might simply fail to take hold, the effect you desire might only be partially achieved, or you might suffer some undesirable outcome as the result of a runaway butterfly effect you failed to anticipate. For example, altering reality with the desire that all Inspired be wiped from the world might propel you centuries forward in time to a period after the age of Dal Quor has turned and destroyed all the quori—effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, revising reality such that you are in the possession of a legendary magic item might pull you to the location of the item's current owner, rather than transporting the item to you.": "你也许能够实现超出上述例子范围的东西。尽可能准确地向DM说明你所期望的对现实的修正。在这种情况下，DM有很大的自由度来决定发生什么；修正得越大，出错的可能性就越大。修正可能只是没有生效，你所期望的效果可能只是部分实现，或者你可能因为你没有预料到的失控的蝴蝶效应而遭受一些不理想的结果。例如，改变现实的愿望是将所有的灵感从世界上抹去，这可能会将你的时间推进到几个世纪前，在达尔-库尔的时代已经转向并摧毁了所有的库里--有效地将你从游戏中移除。同样地，修改现实，使你拥有一件传奇性的魔法物品，可能会把你拉到该物品当前主人的所在地，而不是把该物品运送给你。",
	"The stress of manifesting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power or spell taxes you mentally and physically. After enduring that stress, each time you manifest a power or cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take {@damage 1d10} psychic damage per level of that magical effect. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for {@dice 2d4} days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that the psi points you spent to manifest reality revision are permanently burned, reducing your maximum psi reserve by 18 points. This reduction cannot be reversed by mortal means, even with a {@spell wish|phb} spell or another reality revision, and it applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level.": "体现这种力量产生任何效果的压力，除了复制另一种力量或咒语之外，都会使你在精神和身体上付出代价。在承受了这种压力之后，每次你表现出一种力量或施放一个咒语，直到你完成一个长时间的休息，你都会在该魔法效果的每一级受到（%0%）的精神伤害。这种伤害不能以任何方式减少或预防。此外，你的力量会下降到3，如果它不是3或更低的话，持续（%1%）天。在这些日子里，你每休息一天，只做一些轻微的活动，你的剩余恢复时间就会减少2天。最后，有33%的机会，你为表现现实修正而花费的psi点数被永久地烧掉，使你的最大psi储备减少18点。这种减少无法通过凡人的方式逆转，即使是用{@spell wish|phb}的法术或另一个现实修正，它也适用于你因获得一个等级而获得的任何增加的最大psi储备。",

This power automatically fails if you are already on the Astral Plane when you manifest it.": "你带领一个由两个或更多自愿的神秘旅行者（受你之前展现的（%0%）力量影响的生物，其中一个必须是你自己）组成的商队进入星界和其他地方。当你展现这个力量时，你必须指定另一个存在的位面作为你的目的地（并可以选择该位面中的一个特定位置）。然后，所有神秘的旅行者都会被传送到星界，在那里你开始前往你的目的地。如果你在显现这个能力时已经在星界，那么这个能力会自动失效。",
	"Your journey through the Astral Plane is not instantaneous, instead taking several days, and arrival at your destination is not guaranteed. At the end of each day of astral travel, you must make a DC 15 Arcana check. Successes bring you closer to your destination and failures lead you further away. Your journey ends if you accrue either three successes or three failures. The DM may grant you disadvantage or advantage on these checks, depending on certain factors (the waxing or waning periods of your destination plane, your familiarity with your destination, etc.).": "你在星界的旅行不是瞬间完成的，而是需要几天的时间，并且不能保证到达目的地。在每天的星际旅行结束时，你必须进行DC15的阿卡纳检查。成功会使你更接近你的目的地，失败会使你更远。如果你有三次成功或三次失败，你的旅程就会结束。DM可能会在这些检查中给予你劣势或优势，这取决于某些因素（你的目的地平面的消长期，你对目的地的熟悉程度，等等）。",
	"The result of your journey depends on how many failures you accrued before it ends:": "你的旅程的结果取决于你在结束前累积了多少次失败。",
	"If your journey ends with no failures, all mystic travelers are transported to your intended plane of existence, within 1d10 miles of your destination on that plane if you specified one, or arriving at a random location on that plane if you did not.": "如果你的旅程没有失败，所有神秘的旅行者都会被传送到你预定的存在位面，如果你指定了一个位面，则在该位面的1d10英里内，如果你没有指定，则到达该位面的一个随机位置。",

	"If your journey ends with 2 failures, you are forced to turn back, arriving within 1d10 miles of the location you manifested this power. Additionally, all mystic travelers suffer four levels of {@condition exhaustion} as your astral journey was especially tiring and rough.": "如果你的旅程以2次失败告终，你将被迫折返，到达你显现此力量的地点的1d10英里内。此外，所有神秘的旅行者都会受到四级（%0%）的影响，因为你的星际旅行特别累人，而且很艰难。",
	"If your journey ends because you accrued 3 failures, all mystic travelers run afoul of turbulent psychic currents of the Astral Plane. Each mystic traveler must make a Charisma saving throw, taking {@damage 10d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Then, regardless of the result of the saving throw, each mystic traveler suffers two levels of {@condition exhaustion} and is transported to a random plane of existence, separated from its fellow travelers.": "如果你的旅程因为你累积了3次失败而结束，那么所有的神秘旅行者都会触犯星界的动荡的精神气流。每个神秘的旅行者都必须做一个魅力救赎，如果救赎失败，会受到（%0%）的精神伤害，如果救赎成功，会受到一半的伤害。然后，无论救赎的结果如何，每个神秘旅行者都会受到两级（%1%）的伤害，并被传送到一个随机的存在平面，与其他旅行者分开。",
	"In addition to the pure navigational challenge of the journey, the DM may describe additional encounters and challenges the mystic travelers might face along the way.": "除了旅程中纯粹的导航挑战之外，DM还可以描述神秘的旅行者在途中可能面临的额外遭遇和挑战。",
	"You manifest this power as a reaction to one creature teleporting into, out of, or within range. The teleporting creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to continue its teleport as normal. If the target fails its save, it teleports to a destination of your choice instead of its intended destination, provided the destination you choose is within the normal range of the teleportation effect.": "你表现出这种力量，作为对一个生物传送到、传送出、或传送到范围内的反应。被传送的生物必须在 \"魅力救赎 \"中获得成功，才能继续其正常的传送。如果目标没能救活，它就会被传送到你选择的目的地，而不是它预定的目的地，只要你选择的目的地是在传送效果的正常范围内。",
	"Your condition returns to what it was at the end of your previous turn, minus the psi cost of manifesting this power. You must maintain an accurate record of your hit points, psi points, uses remaining of features, and other pertinent information regarding your overall condition for the point at which you return. If you do not have an accurate record of such information, the power fails. This power only returns your inherent features to their previous state, it has no effect on your equipment, including magic items.": "你的状态会恢复到你上一回合结束时的状态，减去表现这种力量的psi成本。你必须对你的命中率、psi点数、特征的剩余使用量以及其他与你返回时的整体状况有关的信息保持准确的记录。如果你没有这些信息的准确记录，这个能力就会失败。这个能力只使你的固有特征恢复到以前的状态，对你的装备，包括魔法物品没有影响。",
	"You transport yourself backwards in time. The process of regressing yourself to an earlier point in time is exceedingly difficult and dangerous. If you are not in combat, you can attempt to travel backwards in time up to 8 hours, but if you manifest this power while in combat, you can only attempt to regress time back to the point at which you rolled for initiative at the start of the current combat. You must succeed on a psionic ability check against your own power save DC to successfully travel in time with this power. On a failure, you remain in the present moment, take {@damage 10d6} force damage that cannot be mitigated in any way, and the psi points you spent to manifest temporal regression are permanently burned, reducing your maximum psi reserve by 17 points. This reduction cannot be reversed by mortal means, even with a {@spell wish|phb} spell or the {@spell reality revision|Psions Primer} power and it applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level.": "你把自己的时间向后推移。将自己倒退到一个较早的时间点的过程是非常困难和危险的。如果你不在战斗中，你可以尝试将时间倒退到8小时以内，但如果你在战斗中表现出这种能力，你只能尝试将时间倒退到你在当前战斗开始时掷出主动权的那一刻。你必须对自己的力量保全DC进行幻象能力检查，才能成功地用这种力量进行时间旅行。如果失败，你就会停留在当下，受到{@damage 10d6}不能以任何方式减轻的力量伤害，并且你用来表现时间回归的psi点数被永久烧毁，你的最大psi储备减少17点。这种减少无法通过凡人的方式逆转，即使是用{@spell wish|phb}的法术或{@spell reality revision|Psions Primer}的力量，它也适用于你因获得一个等级而获得的任何增加的最大psi储备。",
	"When you travel back in time, only you retain knowledge of the future in which you lived, but small variances in random variables can produce different outcomes to the ones you might expect (for example, a game of chance or sporting event you witnessed the first time around might not result in the exact same outcome you first witnessed). The DM has the final call on the state of the world and the creatures in it after you manifest this power.": "当你穿越时空时，只有你保留了你所处的未来的知识，但随机变量的微小变异会产生与你可能预期的不同的结果（例如，你第一次目睹的机会游戏或体育赛事可能不会导致与你第一次目睹的完全相同的结果）。在你表现出这种能力之后，DM对世界的状态和其中的生物有最终决定权。",
	"Likewise, a combat that you return to the beginning of may have wildly different results, necessitating that the entire encounter be replayed.": "同样，你回到开始时的战斗可能会有截然不同的结果，因此有必要重演整个遭遇战。",
	"While you concentrate on this power, you know when a creature communicating with you via telepathy is lying.": "当你专注于这种能力时，你知道通过心灵感应与你交流的生物在说谎。",
	"When you manifest this augment, you begin communicating telepathically using {@spell mindlink|Psions Primer} with one additional target creature.": "当你表现出这个增强功能时，你开始用{@spell mindlink|Psions Primer}与另外一个目标生物进行心灵感应交流。",
	"In addition, for the duration of this augment, you can use a bonus action on your turn to share one memory of your choice with all targets of {@spell mindlink|Psions Primer}, or allow one target to share one of its memories with yourself and all other targets of {@spell mindlink|Psions Primer}. The recipients of a memory gain perfect recall of one thing the sender of the memory saw or did.": "此外，在这个增强的持续时间内，你可以在你的回合中使用一个额外的行动，与所有目标分享你选择的一个记忆（%0%），或者允许一个目标与你自己和所有其他目标分享其一个记忆（%1%）。记忆的接受者会获得对记忆发送者所见或所做的一件事的完美回忆。",

	"You couch your falsehoods in feelings of trust and acceptance, and deliver them into the mind of another. When you manifest this augment, you target one creature you are telepathically communicating with. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you telepathically communicate one statement of your choice to the target, and the target believes that statement for the duration. The statement can be up to ten words long, and it must describe you or a creature or object the target can see. On a successful save, the target is unaffected. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being {@condition charmed} or it succeeded on a saving throw against this augment since the end of your last long rest.": "你在信任和接受的感觉中掩饰你的谎言，并将它们传递到另一个人的头脑中。当你表现出这种增强功能时，你的目标是一个与你进行心灵感应的生物。目标必须做一个智慧拯救动作。如果救赎失败，你会用心灵感应向目标传达你选择的一句话，而目标会在持续时间内相信这句话。这句话最多可以有十个字，而且必须描述你或目标能看到的生物或物体。拯救成功后，目标不受影响。如果一个生物对 \"被 \"有免疫力（%0%），或者在你最后一次长时休息结束后，它对这个增强效果的救赎成功，那么它就对这个效果免疫。",
	"Your eyes flare in a moment of concentrated, telepathic anger, as you lash out at one creature you are telepathically communicating with. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 1d10} psychic damage and suffers disadvantage on its next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and does not suffer disadvantage from this augment.": "你的眼睛在集中的、心灵感应的愤怒中闪烁，你向一个与你心灵感应的生物发难。目标必须做一个魅力储蓄动作。如果救赎失败，它将受到{@damage 1d10}的精神伤害，并且在你下一回合结束前的下一次智力、智慧或魅力救赎中受到不利影响。拯救成功时，它将受到一半的伤害，并且不会受到此增强效果的不利影响。",
	"You broadcast a short telepathic message of up to 25-words to every creature within range. Any creature you can see, as well as any creatures that you know or know of in the area can be included or excluded from this communication. This communication is one-way only and instantaneous. If a recipient of your communication does not share a language with you, it perceives only garbled mental gibberish.": "你向范围内的每一个生物广播一条短的心灵感应信息，最多25个字。你能看到的任何生物，以及你认识的或知道的该地区的任何生物，都可以包括在或不包括在这种交流中。这种沟通只是单向的，而且是即时的。如果你的交流对象与你没有共同的语言，那么它只能感受到混乱的精神胡言乱语。",
	"When you manifest this augment, and as your action on each turn until your concentration ends, you can focus your mind on one creature you are telepathically communicating with.": "当你表现出这个增强功能时，作为你每个回合的行动，直到你的注意力结束，你可以把你的心思集中在一个与你进行心灵感应的生物上。",
	"When you initially begin to focus on a creature, you initially learn its surface thoughts—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, this power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind.": "当你最初开始关注一个生物时，你首先了解它的表面想法--它在那一刻最想做的事情。作为一个行动，你可以尝试更深入地探测同一个生物的思想。如果你深入探究，目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果它失败了，你就能洞察它的推理（如果有的话），它的情绪状态，以及在它心中占据重要位置的东西（比如它担心的、爱的或恨的东西）。如果它成功了，这个能力就会结束。无论怎样，目标都知道你在探究它的思想。",
	"Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.": "口头向目标生物提出的问题自然会形成它的思维过程，所以这种能力作为审讯的一部分特别有效。",
	"You probe the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must remain within 30 feet of you for the entire manifesting time, otherwise the augment fails. The target must make three Wisdom saving throws, and you learn information from it based on the number of saving throws it fails. The target may voluntarily fail any saves. If the target succeeds on all three saving throws, this power fails.": "你探测范围内你能看到的生物的思想。目标在整个显现时间内必须保持在你的30英尺范围内，否则增强效果就会失效。目标必须进行三次智慧救赎，你根据它失败的救赎次数从它那里了解信息。目标可以自愿不进行任何拯救。如果目标在三次蓄力中都成功了，这个能力就失败了。",
	"If the target fails any saves, you learn the details of events from the target's memories that it considers significant. With one failed saving throw, you learn such details from the past 12 hours; with two failed saving throws, you learn such details from the past 24 hours; and with three failed saving throws, you learn such details from the past 48 hours.": "如果目标的任何救赎失败，你会从目标的记忆中学习它认为重要的事件的细节。如果一次救赎失败，你会学到过去12小时内的这些细节；如果两次救赎失败，你会学到过去24小时内的这些细节；如果三次救赎失败，你会学到过去48小时内的这些细节。",
	"You telepathically infiltrate the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must remain within 30 feet of you for the entire manifesting time, otherwise the power fails. The target must make three Intelligence saving throws. You plant an idea or false memory in the creature's mind, the duration of which depends on the number of saving throws it fails.": "你以心灵感应的方式渗透到你能看到的范围内的生物的思想中。目标在整个显现时间内必须保持在你的30英尺范围内，否则力量就会失效。目标必须进行三次智力测验。你在该生物的脑海中植入一个想法或错误的记忆，其持续时间取决于它失败的拯救次数。",
	"You choose whether the idea or memory is trivial (such as \"I woke up 5 minutes late today\" or \"Griffons are majestic creatures\") or personality-defining (\"I deserted my unit in the war, causing their deaths, and I can barely live with the shame\" or \"Violence is never the answer, I will never touch a weapon again\").": "你可以选择这个想法或记忆是微不足道的（如 \"我今天晚起了5分钟 \"或 \"狮鹫是雄伟的生物\"）还是决定个性的（\"我在战争中抛弃了我的部队，导致他们死亡，我几乎无法忍受这种耻辱 \"或 \"暴力永远不是答案，我永远不会再碰武器\"）。",
	"With one failed saving throw, the idea or memory lasts for the next 4 hours. With two failed saving throws, it lasts for 24 hours. With three failed saving throws, it lasts for 48 hours.": "如果一次救赎失败，这个想法或记忆将持续4小时。两次蓄力失败，它将持续24小时。三次蓄力失败，它将持续48小时。",
	"If you spend 8 extra psi points to manifest this augment, you manifest it as an 8th-level power, its manifesting time is shortened to 1 minute, and the idea or memory lasts one week with one failed saving throw, one month with two failed saving throws, or is permanent with three failed saving throws.": "如果你花了8个额外的psi点数来表现这个强化，你会把它表现为一个8级的力量，它的表现时间缩短为1分钟，而且这个想法或记忆在一次救赎失败后会持续一周，两次救赎失败后会持续一个月，或者三次救赎失败后会永久存在。",
	"You mentally implant a suggested course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and a triggering event (such as \"when you awake two days from now\" or \"when you come within sixty feet of the local Countess\") to magically influence a creature you are telepathically communicating with. Creatures that can't be {@condition charmed} are immune to this effect.": "你在精神上植入一个建议的活动过程（限于一两句话）和一个触发事件（比如 \"当你两天后醒来 \"或 \"当你来到当地伯爵夫人的六十英尺范围内\"），以神奇地影响与你进行心灵感应的生物。不能被（%0%）的生物对这个效果免疫。",
	"When you manifest this power, the target must immediately make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target perceives a faint whisper intruding into its mind, but is not otherwise affected, and you know the suggestion did not take hold. On a failure, the suggestion and trigger are telepathically implanted in the target without their notice. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Suggesting the creature stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.": "当你表现出这种能力时，目标必须立即做一个智慧救赎动作。如果成功，目标会察觉到一个微弱的耳语闯入它的脑海，但不会受到其他影响，而且你知道这个暗示并没有生效。如果失败，暗示和触发器就会在目标身上以心灵感应的方式植入，而他们却没有注意到。暗示的措辞必须使行动过程听起来合理。建议生物刺伤自己，把自己扔到长矛上，自焚，或者做一些其他明显有害的行为，都会结束这个效果。",
	"Once the triggering condition is met, the target pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 8 hours after the triggering condition is met. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was influenced to do. The target will not be able to explain why it took the actions you compelled it to take after the suggestion is triggered and it will have no memory of the suggestion or trigger being implanted.": "一旦触发条件得到满足，目标就会尽其所能地追求你所描述的行动方案。触发条件满足后，建议的行动过程可以持续8小时。如果建议的活动可以在更短的时间内完成，当目标完成它被影响做的事情时，力量就会结束。暗示触发后，目标将无法解释为什么采取你蛊惑它的行动，而且它将没有关于暗示或触发被植入的记忆。",
	"Whenever the target creature finishes a long rest, it may repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success, though it will still not realize it was affected. If the triggering condition is not met before the power expires, the suggested activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the power ends.": "每当目标生物完成长期休息时，它可以重复智慧救赎的动作，如果成功则结束效果，不过它仍然不会意识到自己受到了影响。如果在力量失效前没有满足触发条件，建议的活动就不会进行。如果你或你的任何同伴伤害了目标，则力量结束。",
	"You delve into the depths of the mind of a creature you are telepathically communicating with. You gain limited access to the complete personal experience of the target, from fleeting memories of everyday events to life-defining moments. For the duration, you may use an action to learn the answer to one question that the target could answer. You do not actually converse with the creature, and need not share a language with it. You merely search the target's psyche for the information you seek and find it if it is present.": "你深入到与你进行心灵感应的生物的心灵深处。你可以有限地接触到目标的完整个人经历，从日常事件的短暂记忆到决定人生的时刻。在持续时间内，你可以使用一个行动来了解目标人物可以回答的一个问题的答案。你实际上并不与该生物交谈，也不需要与它共享一种语言。你只是在目标的心灵中搜索你所寻求的信息，如果它存在的话，你就能找到它。",
	"The target may refuse to give you access to an answer if it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw, but success on this saving throw does not end the power. You may continue to seek answers (either to the same question or a different one) in subsequent rounds of the effect, until the duration ends. This power ends early if the target moves out of range.": "目标可以拒绝让你获得答案，如果它的 \"魅力储蓄 \"成功的话，但这个储蓄的成功并不会终止这个力量。你可以在效果的后续回合中继续寻求答案（无论是同一个问题还是另一个问题），直到持续时间结束。如果目标移动到范围之外，这个能力就会提前结束。",
	"An {@condition unconscious} creature automatically provides you answers, but after you receive an answer from it, it may make a Wisdom saving throw if it has at least 1 hit point, becoming conscious on a success.": "一个{@condition unconscious}的生物会自动为你提供答案，但在你从它那里得到答案后，如果它至少有1个命中点，它可以进行智慧救赎，成功后会变得有意识。",
	"You touch one humanoid you are telepathically communicating with and infect it with a parasitic seed of your own psyche. The target must make a Charisma saving throw immediately when you manifest this power on it, and must then repeat the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest. If the target successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends and the parasitic seed fades away with no effect. If it fails its save three times, the parasitic seed of your psyche in the target's mind germinates. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.": "你接触一个与你有心灵感应的人，用你自己精神的寄生种子感染它。当你在目标身上表现出这种力量时，它必须立即做一个 \"魅力救赎\"，然后在它完成长时间休息时必须重复这个救赎。如果目标成功地对这个力量进行了三次救赎，这个力量就会结束，寄生的种子也会消逝，没有任何影响。如果它救赎失败三次，你的精神寄生种子就会在目标的头脑中发芽。成功和失败不需要是连续的；保持对两者的追踪，直到目标收集到三个同类的。",
	"While a creature is still making saves against this power, it acts normally but begins to mimic quirks of your own personality. For instance, if you have a habit of ending sentences with \"y'know?\" the target begins doing so as well, subconsciously.": "当一个生物仍在对这种力量进行救赎时，它的行为是正常的，但开始模仿你自己性格的怪癖。例如，如果你有以 \"你知道吗？\"结束句子的习惯，目标也会下意识地开始这样做。",
	"If the parasitic seed germinates, the target's mind is replaced with a duplicate of your own. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match yours at the time you manifested this power on it. The target loses all class levels and class specific NPC traits it might have, and gains the class levels you had 8 levels ago (in effect, gaining the same experience and abilities you had 8 levels earlier). Its physical ability scores, race, and appearance do not change.": "如果寄生种子发芽，目标的思想会被替换成你自己的复制品。它的智力、智慧和魅力分数会改变，与你在它身上表现出这种力量时的分数相一致。目标失去了它可能拥有的所有等级和特定等级的NPC特征，而获得你8级之前的等级（实际上，获得了你8级之前的相同经验和能力）。它的物理能力分数、种族和外观不会改变。",
	"Although the target becomes a mental duplicate of you, you have no special control over it, and its personality may diverge from yours over time. The duplicate psyche's initial attitude toward you is friendly, but it does not believe itself to be your servant or slave, and it will act as you would if it is treated as such.": "虽然目标成为你的精神复制体，但你对它没有特别的控制权，而且它的个性可能会随着时间的推移而与你产生分歧。复制的精神体最初对你的态度是友好的，但它不认为自己是你的仆人或奴隶，如果它被当作仆人或奴隶对待，它会像你那样行动。",
	"Effects that prevent possession prevent you from infecting a target with mind seed, but grant no protection once the seed is already implanted. An intensified {@spell revitalization|Psions Primer}, {@spell greater restoration|Psions Primer}, or the break enchantment effect of {@spell dispel evil and good|Psions Primer} cast on the target specifically to cleanse it of a growing mind seed does so only if the caster succeeds on a spellcasting or psionic ability check with a DC equal to your power save DC, and only if cast on the target before it fails three saves against mind seed.": "防止附身的效果可以防止你用心灵种子感染目标，但一旦种子已经植入，就不会给予保护。强化的{@spell revitalization|Psions Primer}、{@spell greater restoration|Psions Primer}或{@spell dispel evil and good|Psions Primer}的破除魔法效果是为了清除目标身上正在生长的心灵种子，只有当施法者成功地进行魔法或幻术能力检查，其DC等于你的力量保存DC，并且只有在目标对心灵种子的三次拯救失败之前施法。",
	"Once the parasitic seed of your psyche germinates in a target, only {@spell reality revision|Psions Primer}, {@spell wish|phb}, {@spell psychic chirurgery|Psions Primer}, or similarly powerful magical effects can restore the target to its original personality and class levels (if applicable).": "一旦你心灵的寄生种子在目标体内发芽，只有{@spell reality revision|Psions Primer}、{@spell wish|phb}、{@spell psychic chirurgery|Psions Primer}或类似的强大魔法效果才能将目标恢复到其原有的人格和等级（如果适用）。",
	"You telepathically enter the mind of a willing creature you touch, and skillfully repair or improve its psyche. When you manifest this power, you choose one of the following effects.": "你以心灵感应的方式进入你所接触到的自愿的生物的心灵，并巧妙地修复或改善其心灵。当你表现出这种能力时，你可以选择以下效果之一。",
	"If the target is {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}, you instantly end those conditions on the target. You also automatically end any effect that mentally limits or dictates actions the creature can take (such as {@spell id insinuation|Psions Primer}, {@spell ego whip|Psions Primer}, or the {@spell command|phb} or {@spell confusion|phb} spells), possession, permanent insanity, madness, or a reduction in maximum hit points caused by an effect that dealt psychic damage. Additionally you restore the creature's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores to normal if they were reduced by another effect.": "如果目标是{@condition charmed}或{@condition frightened}，你立即结束目标身上的这些状况。你也会自动结束任何在精神上限制或支配生物可以采取的行动的效果（例如（%2%）、（%3%）、或（%4%）或（%5%）的法术）、附身、永久精神错乱、疯狂、或由造成精神伤害的效果所造成的最大命中率降低。此外，如果该生物的智力、智慧和魅力分数被其他效果降低，你会将它们恢复到正常。",
	"If you choose this effect, you begin to concentrate. If you maintain your concentration for a full minute, you permanently bestow the target creature with the ability to cast one psionic talent that you know, or the {@spell wild talent|Psions Primer} power.

Among the Akiak, duergar develop psionic powers. The origin of these mental abilities is a mystery. Some suspect a failed Inspired breeding program of enslaved duergar, while others offer conjecture that Sarlona's planar \"aukaraks\" or \"reality storms\" influenced the psionic potential in the gray-skinned dwarves.": "萨洛纳的阿基克矮人是一个由杜尔加人和其他矮人组成的综合社会。他们是一个曾经强大的国家的残余，但被鼓舞者的崛起打败了。几个世纪以来，里德兰帝国一有机会就奴役他们在矿场和营地里劳作，所以阿基亚克人保持着流动性，在萨洛纳北部塔沙纳苔原的荒凉土地上流浪。在阿基亚克人中，杜尔加人发展出幻觉能力。这些精神能力的起源是个谜。一些人怀疑是被奴役的duergar的灵感繁殖计划失败了，而另一些人则猜测是萨洛纳的平面 \"aukaraks \"或 \"现实风暴 \"影响了灰皮肤的矮人的幻觉潜能。",

	"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller.

	"Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.": "矮人可以活到400岁以上，所以最年长的活着的矮人往往记得一个非常不同的世界。例如，一些生活在费尔巴尔城堡（Citadel Felbarr）的最年长的矮人可以回忆起三个多世纪前的那一天，当时兽人征服了这个要塞，并把他们赶到了一个持续了250多年的流放地。这种长寿赋予他们对世界的看法，这是人类和半身人等寿命较短的种族所缺乏的。",
	"Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.": "矮人就像他们所爱的山一样坚实而持久，以坚忍不拔的毅力经受着几个世纪的考验，几乎没有变化。他们尊重自己部族的传统，将自己的祖先追溯到他们在世界青年时期建立的最古老的据点，并且不会轻易放弃这些传统。这些传统的一部分是对矮人之神的虔诚，他们维护矮人勤劳的劳动、战斗的技巧和对锻造的奉献等理想。",
	"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.": "个别矮人坚定而忠诚，言而有信，行动果断，有时甚至到了固执的地步。许多矮人有强烈的正义感，他们对自己遭受的错误迟迟不能忘怀。对一个矮人所做的错事就是对这个矮人的整个部族所做的错事，因此，开始时只是一个矮人的复仇行动可能会变成一个全面的部族争斗。",
	"Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.": "矮人王国延伸到山下深处，在那里，矮人开采宝石和贵重金属，锻造神奇的物品。他们热爱贵金属和高级珠宝的美感和艺术性，而在一些矮人身上，这种热爱会发酵成贪婪。无论他们在自己的山里找不到什么财富，他们都会通过贸易获得。他们不喜欢船，所以有进取心的人类和半身人经常沿着水路处理矮人货物的贸易。矮人定居点欢迎值得信赖的其他种族成员，尽管有些地区甚至对他们来说是禁区。",
	"The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.": "矮人社会的主要单位是部族，矮人高度重视社会地位。即使是远离自己王国的矮人，也会珍惜自己的氏族身份和归属，承认相关的矮人，并在誓言和诅咒中援引他们祖先的名字。没有氏族是可能降临到矮人身上的最糟糕的命运。",
	"Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.": "其他国家的矮人通常是工匠，尤其是武器制造者、装甲师和珠宝商。有些人成为雇佣兵或保镖，因其勇气和忠诚度而备受追捧。",
	"Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.": "开始冒险生活的矮人可能是出于对宝藏的渴望--为了它本身，为了一个特定的目的，甚至是出于帮助他人的利他主义愿望。其他矮人则是受神灵的命令或灵感驱使，是一种直接的召唤，或者仅仅是为了给某个矮人神灵带来荣耀的愿望。部族和祖先也是重要的动机。矮人可能会寻求恢复一个部族失去的荣誉，为部族遭受的古老错误报仇，或者在被流放后在部族中获得新的地位。或者一个矮人可能会寻找一个强大的祖先所挥舞的斧头，这个斧头在几个世纪前的战场上丢失。",
	"Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. \"The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,\" is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.": "矮人与大多数其他种族相处得相当好。\"一个熟人和一个朋友之间的区别大约是一百年。\"这是矮人的一句话，可能是夸张的，但肯定指出了像人类这样短命的种族成员要赢得矮人的信任是多么困难。",
	"\"It's not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc's head, they're as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They're flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don't have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work.

Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.\"": "\"依赖精灵是不明智的。不知道精灵下一步会做什么；当锤子碰到兽人的头时，他们就会像拔出剑一样开始唱歌。他们善于逃跑，而且很轻浮。不过，有两件事要为他们说。他们的铁匠不多，但他们的铁匠做得非常好。当兽人或地精从山中涌出时，精灵是你的好帮手。也许不如矮人好，但毫无疑问，他们和我们一样讨厌兽人。\"",

	"While psionics has come to dominate the continent of Sarlona with the arrival of the kalashtar and the rise of the Inspired, these were not the first peoples to adopt psionic power in history. Indeed, shrouded in Sarlona's pre-Sundering past is the ancient nation of Khalesh. The people of Khalesh were righteous and just—at least, according to them—and channeled holy power to crusade against the evils of their time. Sages of the Library of Korranberg have identified Khalesh's ancient religion as a \"serpent cult,\" worshiping the celestial couatl and venerating their fight against the demonic forces of Khyber. Unbeknown to Khalesh's greater population, however, the champions and nobles of their society were infused with the essence of couatls themselves, becoming the shulassakar, whose bloodlines were bestowed with several traits associated with their serpentine idols—some more noticeable than others. Among the more subtle of these traits was the innate psionic power that the couatls themselves possessed.": "虽然随着卡拉什塔人的到来和启发者的崛起，幻术已经主宰了萨洛纳大陆，但这些并不是历史上第一批采用幻术力量的民族。事实上，笼罩在萨洛纳的前桑德时代的是古老的卡莱什国家。卡勒什的人民是正义的，至少，根据他们的说法，他们引导神圣的力量来讨伐他们时代的邪恶。科兰贝格图书馆的圣人认定卡勒什的古代宗教是一种 \"蛇崇拜\"，崇拜天体的库亚特尔，并崇尚他们与开伯尔的恶魔势力的斗争。然而，卡勒什的广大民众并不知道，他们社会中的冠军和贵族们被注入了库拉特尔本身的精髓，成为舒拉萨卡，他们的血统被赋予了与他们的蛇形偶像有关的若干特征--有些特征比其他特征更明显。在这些特征中，比较微妙的是库拉特斯本身所拥有的先天性的幻觉能力。",
	"Despite their psionics and divine aid, the nation of Khalesh was conquered during the Sundering of Sarlona and was eventually subsumed into the Unity of Riedra. The shulassakar themselves were hunted by the Inspired, who ironically accused them of being possessed by altavars (\"evil spirits\").": "尽管他们有幻术和神力的帮助，卡勒什国家在萨尔罗纳的毁灭中被征服，并最终被归入里德拉统一体。舒拉萨卡人自己也被鼓舞者追杀，鼓舞者讽刺地指责他们被阿尔塔瓦（\"恶灵\"）附身。",
	"Little is known of where Khalesh's shulassakar went, or if they were the only peoples so blessed by the couatl, but isolated outposts of shulassakar can be found throughout the world—such as the guardians of the ruins of Krezent in the Blade Desert of eastern Khorvaire. Typically these shulassakar have no contact with others of their kind and repel all intruders. The shulassakar can be coldly ruthless in their opposition to evil. If a fiendish evil lurks in a forgotten ruin, the shulassakar are willing to go to any lengths to stop explorers and treasure-seekers from disrupting the seals imprisoning the darkness, up to and including murdering innocents to prevent a demonic apocalypse.": "人们对卡勒什的舒拉萨卡的去向知之甚少，也不知道他们是否是唯一受到库阿特尔祝福的民族，但在世界各地都可以找到舒拉萨卡的孤立前哨--比如霍尔韦尔东部刀锋沙漠中的克雷森特遗址的守护者。通常情况下，这些舒拉萨卡人不与其他同类接触，并击退所有入侵者。舒拉萨卡人在反对邪恶方面可以是冷酷无情的。如果在一个被遗忘的废墟中潜伏着邪恶，舒拉萨卡人愿意不惜一切代价阻止探险家和寻宝者破坏囚禁黑暗的封印，甚至包括谋杀无辜者以防止恶魔的启示。",
	"These righteous champions bear a startling resemblance to another king of serpentfolk—the yuan-ti.

The city of Sharn may have only a single bloodsworn disguised among its human population, watching for any sign of demonic corruption.": "血族是相当于元老级纯血族的Shulassakar。然而，当纯种人渗入人类社会寻求削弱和腐蚀它的时候，流血者则是对抗黑暗的隐藏哨兵。血族人构成了任何舒拉萨卡部队的主体，但在一个孤立的要塞-驻军之外，血族人极为罕见。沙恩市可能只有一个伪装在人类中的血衣人，观察任何恶魔腐败的迹象。",

The mystic leaders of this monastery guided the others in a meditation to manifest a communal psionic power unknown to modern day psions and mystics, one that promised all who participated in it true enlightenment. When the ritual was completed, the monks indeed cast off their mortal bodies, but rather than transcending to a higher realm of existence, their consciousnesses became mired in the physical realm.

The higher consciousnesses of those ancient monks, thus free of all desire, were able to transcend mortal existence.

Others can hone their natural connection to Dal Quor and draw energy from the emotions and pure imagination that make up that plane of existence, manifesting their thoughts on the material plane as psionic powers.": "Quori和其他与Dal Quor有紧密联系的生命，如卡拉什塔和Thri-Kreen，有与生俱来的幻象能力，他们从这个平面汲取能量。其他人可以磨练他们与达尔-库尔的自然联系，并从构成该存在平面的情感和纯粹的想象力中汲取能量，将他们的想法在物质平面上表现为幻象能力。",
	"While the current nature of Dal Quor is that of a dark nightmare, the inherent essence of the plane remains that of all dreams, so psionic powers originating from Dal Quor are not inherently evil.": "虽然达尔-库尔目前的性质是黑暗的噩梦，但这个平面的内在本质仍然是所有的梦境，所以源自达尔-库尔的幻觉力量并不是本质上的邪恶。",
	"Xoriat is often misunderstood as a realm of alien entities and unnatural horrors beyond imagining, but it is actually formed from the wildest possibilities of the sentient mind stripped of its limits. All thinking minds touch upon the Realm of Madness, some to a greater degree than others. And while Xoriat is an inherently evil- aligned plane of existence, not all of those with a strong connection to the Realm of Madness need be a detriment to society. While the insane cultist acting upon violent delusions is a reflection of Xoriat, so too is the genius artificer innovating brilliant, never-before-thought-of designs.": "Xoriat经常被误解为一个由外星实体和超乎想象的非自然恐怖组成的领域，但它实际上是由剥离了限制的有知觉的心灵的最疯狂的可能性形成的。所有有思想的头脑都会触及 \"疯狂之境\"，有些人的程度比其他人更深。虽然Xoriat是一个与生俱来的邪恶的存在，但并不是所有与疯狂之境有紧密联系的人都会对社会造成危害。虽然依靠暴力妄想行事的疯狂崇拜者是Xoriat的反映，但天才的工匠也是如此，他们创新了辉煌的、从未想过的设计。",
	"Cultists and aberrations who draw their psionic power from this plane often refer to it as the Realm of Revelations, rather than one of madness. To them, Xoriat is the truth of reality, and one can only see the truth when they accept that their mind has the ability to create reality.": "从这个位面汲取灵媒力量的崇拜者和反常者经常把它称为 \"启示之境\"，而不是疯狂之境。对他们来说，Xoriat是现实的真相，而一个人只有在接受自己的头脑有能力创造现实时才能看到真相。",
	"While Dal Quor and Xoriat are the most commonly identified planes of thought in Eberron, psionic potential may also be drawn from the Sea of Siberys, also known as the Astral Sea or Astral Plane. The Astral Sea is the medium through which Eberron's outer planes orbit the Material Plane. Currents of psychic wind churn in the vast silver void of the plane, and the rare few natives of the plane often possess psychic potential. While Dal Quor and Xoriat are focused, distilled expressions of thought, the Sea of Siberys is diffuse and ephemeral in its connection to the mind.": "虽然达尔-库尔（Dal Quor）和索里亚特（Xoriat）是伊伯伦最常见的思维平面，但幻象潜能也可以从西伯利亚之海（Siberys）中获取，也被称为星海或星际平面。星海是艾伯伦的外部位面围绕物质位面运行的媒介。通灵之风的气流在该位面巨大的银色虚空中汹涌澎湃，而该位面少有的几个本地人往往拥有通灵的潜力。达尔-库尔（Dal Quor）和索里亚特（Xoriat）是思想的集中、提炼的表达，而西伯利亚之海在与心灵的联系中则是弥漫和短暂的。",
	"Several of the rules and abilities presented in this book presume the existence of planes of thought, but you do not need to use Dal Quor and Xoriat if your game is not set in Eberron. In other campaign settings, you can use alternative planes of thought, such as the following:": "本书中介绍的一些规则和能力假定了思想界的存在，但如果你的游戏不是以Eberron为背景，你就不需要使用Dal Quor和Xoriat。在其他战役背景下，你可以使用替代性的思想界，比如以下这些。",
	"{@book Appendix C of the Player's Handbook|PHB|13} describes the Astral Plane as a \"the realm of thought and dream.\" Like Eberron's Sea of Siberys, many of the rare inhabitants of the Astral Plane have inherent psionic power, and the plane responds to thoughts and ideals, allowing psionic characters to draw energy and matter from it.": "{@book Appendix C of the Player's Handbook|PHB|13}将星界描述为一个 \"思想和梦想的领域\"。就像Eberron的Siberys海一样，星界的许多稀有居民拥有固有的幻术能力，而且星界对思想和理想有反应，允许有幻术的角色从中汲取能量和物质。",
	"In campaigns using the Great Wheel cosmology, the Far Realm is an alien place that exists outside the known planes of existence. Horrible alien monstrosities and aberrations originate from this place and are associated with psionic power. Consider allowing rules elements that draw on the psionic power of madness to originate from the Far Realm.": "在使用大轮回宇宙学的活动中，远界是一个存在于已知存在平面之外的异域。可怕的外星怪兽和畸形物都来自这个地方，并与幻觉力量有关。可以考虑允许那些借助于疯狂的幻觉力量的规则元素来自远界。",
	"As an alternative to the Astral Plane, the power of dreams can be ascribed to the fey and the Feywild in core D&D campaigns, as evidenced by supplemental material like the {@class druid|xge|Circle of Dreams druid|Circle of Dreams} subclass in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}. Consider powers that deal with dreams to originate from the Feywild for settings that do not have a dedicated plane of dreams. If the DM wishes, the quori may even be a race of dark fey in such campaigns, rather than fiends or aberrations.": "作为星界的替代品，在D&D的核心战役中，梦的力量可以归属于精灵和精灵世界，这一点可以从{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中的{@class druid|xge|Circle of Dreams druid|Circle of Dreams}子类等补充材料中得到证明。在没有专门的梦境平面的设定中，可以考虑将处理梦境的力量源自于 \"仙境\"。如果DM愿意，在这样的战役中，科里甚至可以成为黑暗精灵的一个种族，而不是魔族或畸形人。",
	"In some settings, psionics have no external source and are a natural extension of a psionic creature itself. A psion in such a setting, for instance, would owe their power to no other entity or source but their own mind. Whenever a character in such a campaign setting uses a power or ability that interacts with a plane of thought, the psionic potential of the action originates with the character, and they merely pull matter or energy from a plane of existence that is amenable to such interaction, such as the Astral Plane.": "在某些环境中，幻术没有外部来源，是幻术生物本身的自然延伸。例如，在这样的环境中，一个幻术师除了他们自己的思想之外，没有其他实体或来源可以提供他们的力量。无论何时，在这样的战役背景下，一个角色使用了与思维平面互动的力量或能力，该行动的幻术潜能就来源于该角色，他们只是从一个可以进行这种互动的存在平面，如星界，拉动物质或能量。",
	"While psionic power originates from the planes in Eberron, cultures that employ psionics exist on the material plane itself. The most organized, established, and advanced of these are the psionic societies of Sarlona, though several cults of the Dragon Below in Khorvaire also nurture psionic power among their numbers.": "虽然幻术的力量源自Eberron的各个位面，但运用幻术的文化却存在于物质位面本身。其中最有组织、最成熟、最先进的是萨尔罗纳的幻术社会，尽管霍尔韦尔的几个龙下之城的邪教也在他们的人数中培养了幻术力量。",
	"Secretive cults dedicated to the powers of the Dragon Below hide among all levels of Khorvairian society. They are not, however, a monolithic force. Each cult has its own independent circle of followers, culled from the insane, the desperate, and the vulnerable. Some of these cults arise naturally from societal pressures and charismatic leaders. Other cults originate from aberrations and creatures of Khyber manipulating the downtrodden and performing obscene experiments on them which may result in the manifestation of psionic powers. ": "秘密的邪教致力于龙的力量，隐藏在Khorvairian社会的各个层面。然而，他们并不是一个单一的力量。每个邪教都有自己独立的追随者圈子，他们来自疯狂的人、绝望的人和脆弱的人。其中一些邪教是在社会压力和有魅力的领导人的作用下自然产生的。其他的邪教则是由开伯尔的反常者和生物操纵受压迫者，并对他们进行淫秽的实验，这可能会导致幻觉能力的显现。",
	"Though most links to Xoriat were sealed by the Gatekeeper druids some nine millennia ago, several manifest zones tied to the Realm of Madness still exist, predominantly in the deep swamps of the Shadow Marches. Sometimes people born within one of these zones are gifted with raw psionic potential. These people are typically called \"wild savants\" and are ostracized by others for their strange abilities. If driven too far into the fringes of society, they may find greater psionic power by succumbing to the call of Xoriat, and begin forming their own cults in service to their mad egos or mounting delusions.": "虽然大多数与Xoriat的联系在大约九千年前就被守门人德鲁伊封印了，但仍有几个与疯狂之境有关的显化区存在，主要是在阴影地带的深层沼泽。有时在这些区域内出生的人被赋予原始的幻觉潜能。这些人通常被称为 \"野蛮人\"，并因其奇怪的能力而被其他人排斥。如果被驱赶到社会的边缘，他们可能会通过屈服于Xoriat的召唤而找到更大的幻觉能力，并开始形成自己的邪教，为他们疯狂的自我或不断增加的妄想服务。",
	"Illithids and their kin are the most widely feared and psionically potent aberrations in Khyber, and they often create hereditary cults dedicated to them to ensure a steady diet of humanoid brains. Members of these cults with psionic potential are seen as possessing the blessing of the mind flayers and are exempted from harvest, becoming lieutenants in the cult hierarchy. In reality, their illithid masters merely see them as useful thralls and puppets, elevated from livestock.": "伊利特人和他们的亲属是开伯尔最广为人知的、具有强大灵性的异类，他们经常创建专门为他们服务的世袭邪教，以确保稳定的人形大脑食物。这些邪教中具有幻觉潜能的成员被视为拥有心灵传播者的祝福，可以免于收获，成为邪教等级制度中的副手。实际上，他们的幻术师只是将他们视为有用的傀儡和木偶，从牲畜中提升出来。",
	"Some of the Khyber cults that most commonly attract psionic followers are those dedicated to the Master of Silence, one of the horrific entities from Xoriat known as the daelkyr that were sealed in Khyber at the end of the Xoriat Invasion nine millennia ago. The Master of Silence is whispered to possess the most immense psychic might of all the daelkyr. Admittance into cults dedicated to this entity usually impose a vow of silence onto their initiates, as uttering even a single word is blasphemy to these cults. Instead, communication is nonverbal, with those capable of telepathy being the most blessed and favored, often leading the cults of Silence.": "一些最常吸引灵媒信徒的开伯尔邪教是那些献给沉默大师的邪教，沉默大师是九千年前索里亚特入侵结束时被封印在开伯尔的可怕实体之一，被称为daelkyr。沉默大师据说拥有所有daelkyr中最巨大的精神力量。进入献给这个实体的邪教，通常会对他们的入门者施加沉默的誓言，因为对这些邪教来说，说出一个字都是亵渎。相反，交流是非语言的，那些有心灵感应能力的人是最有福气和最受宠的，他们往往领导着沉默的邪教。",
	"Sarlona is a continent in the eastern hemisphere of the world of Eberron and the birthplace of humanity. It had a long and storied history of both divine and arcane magical traditions, and when Sarlonan settlers emigrated to Khorvaire these traditions formed the basis for the magical knowledge of what would become the Five Nations. After the events known as the Sundering of Sarlona 1,500 years ago, however, Sarlona saw a sharp decline in the use of all forms of magic other than psionics. The Sundering was a continent-spanning conflict that saw most existing nations and power structures of Sarlona collapse. From the devastation, the Inspired rose and formed the Unity of Riedra.": "萨尔罗纳是艾伯伦世界东半球的一块大陆，也是人类的发源地。它拥有悠久的历史，包括神圣和神秘的魔法传统，当萨尔罗纳的定居者移民到霍尔韦尔时，这些传统形成了后来五国的魔法知识的基础。然而，在1500年前被称为 \"萨尔罗纳的毁灭 \"的事件之后，萨尔罗纳看到除了幻术之外，所有形式的魔法的使用都急剧下降。毁灭是一场跨越大陆的冲突，见证了萨洛纳大多数现有国家和权力结构的崩溃。在这场浩劫中，受到鼓舞的人们站了起来，形成了里德拉统一体。",
	"The Unity of Riedra dominates the continent of Sarlona and is ruled by the Inspired, a caste of people the populace believes to be spiritually guided by the enlightened spirits of their ancestors. The populace attributes the peaceful golden age following the Sundering to the enlightened, benevolent rulership of the Inspired. In truth, the Sundering was orchestrated by the quori, malevolent beings from Dal Quor, and the Inspired leaders of Riedra are mortal vessels eugenically bred for quori possession. The Riedran empire is ruled by psionic fiends, and the populace is kept controlled by nightly psychic broadcasts projected into their dreaming minds.": "里德拉统一体主宰着萨洛纳大陆，由受启发者统治，民众认为他们受到祖先开明精神的指引。民众认为，毁灭后的和平黄金时代归功于启发者的开明、仁慈的统治。事实上，毁灭是由来自达尔-库尔（Dal Quor）的邪恶生物--科里（Quori）策划的，而瑞德兰的灵感领袖是为科里的占有而优生的凡人容器。里德兰帝国由幻象魔人统治，民众被投射到他们梦中的心灵广播所控制。",
	"While psionic ability in Sarlona is not as widespread as arcane knowledge is in Khorvaire, the Inspired and their favored servants tend to be more powerful than typical spellcasters in the Five Nations. Most Sarlonan settlements are locked in simple agrarian lifestyles, while rare Riedran cities benefit from psionic conveniences and marvels, such as a network of permanent teleportation gateways, reserved exclusively for the use of the Inspired and their entourages.": "虽然萨洛纳的幻术能力并不像霍尔韦尔的奥术知识那样普遍，但受启发者和他们所宠爱的仆人往往比五国的典型施法者更加强大。大多数萨尔罗纳人的定居点都被禁锢在简单的农业生活方式中，而罕见的里德兰城市则受益于幻术的便利和奇迹，比如一个永久的传送门网络，专供受启发者和他们的随从使用。",
	"The Sundering of Sarlona, the arrival of the Inspired, and the near-total unification of the continent under the Riedran empire did not occur by mere happenstance or whim. Before the empty vessels for Inspired possession were created, the first mortal vessels for quori were sixty-seven human monks from a single monastery in the mountain range of Adar. Unlike the quori that would come to dominate Sarlona nearly a millennium later, the first quori to arrive on the Material Plane were virtuous rebels and refugees, dissatisfied with the ever- present evil and darkness of their home.": "萨尔罗纳的解体，受启发者的到来，以及大陆在里德兰帝国下近乎完全的统一，并不是仅仅因为偶然或心血来潮而发生的。在启发者附身的空容器被创造出来之前，第一批凡人的狴犴容器是来自阿达尔山脉的一个修道院的67名人类僧侣。与近一千年后主宰萨洛纳的科里不同，第一批来到物质世界的科里是善良的反叛者和难民，对他们家乡永远存在的邪恶和黑暗感到不满。",
	"Adar had always been a place of refuge, so when these runaway quori came to Adaran monks in their dreams and begged for asylum, it was granted. The quori merged with their willing human hosts, creating the kalashtar bloodlines.": "阿达尔一直是一个避难所，所以当这些离家出走的奎利人在梦中来到阿达兰僧侣面前，乞求庇护时，他们得到了批准。奎利人与他们自愿的人类宿主融合在一起，创造了卡拉什塔的血统。",
	"Since then, the techniques and disciplines of psionic power have become widespread in Adar, even outside kalashtar lineages. The safety of the region itself is ensured by the Shroud, a massive psionic barrier that protects the mountains and monasteries from invasion. The Shroud has defended Adar from a centuries-long siege by the Inspired aimed at wiping out the kalashtar and the rebel quori who have merged with their bloodlines.": "从那时起，幻象能力的技术和学科在阿达尔变得很普遍，甚至在卡拉什塔家族之外。该地区本身的安全由 \"裹尸布 \"保证，它是一个巨大的幻象屏障，保护山区和寺院不受入侵。裹尸布保卫了阿达尔，使其免遭灵感组织长达几个世纪的围攻，其目的是消灭卡拉什塔人和与他们的血统相融合的反叛者科里。",
	"The full potential of psionic power can only be achieved by dedicated focus and meditation, represented by taking levels in psionic classes, or choosing subclasses that also grant psionic power.

	"Many psionic powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a power's effects. The power specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. The DC to resist one of your powers equals 8 + your psionic ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.": "许多幻象能力规定，目标可以通过蓄力来避免部分或全部能力的影响。该力量规定了目标在救赎时使用的能力，以及成功或失败时的情况。抵抗你的力量的DC等于8+你的幻象能力修饰+你的熟练度奖励+任何特殊修饰。",
	"Some powers require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the psionic effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a power attack equals your psionic ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Most powers that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't {@condition incapacitated}.": "有些力量需要你进行一次攻击卷，以确定幻象效果是否击中预定目标。你的力量攻击奖励等于你的幻象能力修改值+你的熟练度奖励。大多数需要攻击卷的力量涉及到远程攻击。记住，如果你在一个能看到你的敌对生物的5英尺范围内，而这个敌对生物没有（%0%），那么你的范围攻击卷就有劣势。",
	"Talents are psionic powers that are also cantrip spells, and follow most of the normal rules for casting spells, such as casting time, range, and area of effect.

	"This school consists of effects that manifest energy or telekinetic force.": "这一派包括表现能量或心灵感应的效果。",
	"Some psionic effects impose will over flesh, pushing living biology beyond its normal limits. Spells and abilities that defend against transmutation also provide protection from psychometabolism powers.": "一些幻术效果将意志强加于肉体之上，使生物体超越其正常极限。抵御转化的法术和能力也能提供对精神代谢能力的保护。",
	"Psionic effects that move objects or creatures through time, space, and planes of existence belong to this school.": "在时间、空间和存在界中移动物体或生物的幻觉效果属于这个流派。",

	"Most psionic talents do not have normal components (verbal, somatic, or material), as they are products entirely of the mind. However, the act of casting a psionic cantrip is oftentimes obvious to observers, and such psionic effects have the following components:": "大多数幻术天赋没有正常的成分（语言、身体或物质），因为它们完全是心灵的产物。然而，对于观察者来说，施展幻术的行为往往是显而易见的，这种幻术效果有以下成分。",
	"Some manner of noise audible to all within 60 feet accompanies the use of psionic powers with this component. Creatures within 30 feet can determine the origin of the sound as easily as if it were regular, clear speech.": "在使用这个组件的幻术能力时，60英尺内的人都能听到某种形式的噪音。30英尺范围内的生物可以轻易地确定声音的来源，就像它是普通的、清晰的语言一样。",

	"Psionic powers that magnify the effects of psionic talents are called augments. Augments follow many of the same rules as spells: range, targets, areas of effect, saving throws, attack rolls, and combining magical effects (described in {@book Chapter 10: Spellcasting of the Player's Handbook|phb|10}). However psionic augments are not spells and have a few rules unique to them, described below.": "将幻术天赋的效果放大的幻术力量被称为增强。增强物遵循许多与法术相同的规则：范围、目标、作用区域、蓄力、攻击卷，以及结合魔法效果（在（%0%）中描述）。然而，幻术增强物不是法术，有一些独特的规则，如下所述。",
	"Each psionic augment has a listed power level, ranging from 1 to 9. When you manifest an augment, it increases the spell level of the psionic talent it is augmenting to be equal to the augment's power level.

	"As cantrips, unaugmented talents have a spell level of 0 and their spell level is only increased by augments you manifest while you focus on them. If your focus on a talent ends but the duration of an augment continues, the talent does not automatically gain the increased spell level if you cast it again before the augment's duration ends.": "作为咒语，未被增强的天赋的法术等级为0，它们的法术等级只被你在专注于它们时表现出来的增强所提高。如果你对一个天赋的关注结束了，但增强物的持续时间仍在继续，那么如果你在增强物的持续时间结束前再次施放该天赋，该天赋不会自动获得增加的法术等级。",
	"Augments aren't spells, but the effects of augments with non- instantaneous durations can be ended early with dispel magic by dispelling the psionic talent they are augmenting at its augmented spell level. An augment that is manifested without focusing on a talent, such as one cast via certain magic items, has a spell level equal to its power level for the purpose of adjudicating dispel magic.": "扩增不是法术，但具有非瞬时持续时间的扩增的效果可以通过驱散它们所扩增的幻术天赋，以其扩增的法术等级提前结束。在不专注于天赋的情况下表现出来的增强，比如通过某些魔法物品施放的增强，在裁决驱散魔法时，其法术等级等于其力量等级。",
	"Augments have the same psionic schools of magic that talents do. Most augments are of the same school as the talent they modify, but manifesting some augments changes the school of the psionic talent they augment for the duration of their effects.": "增强器和天赋一样有相同的幻象魔法流派。大多数增强器与它们所修改的天赋属于同一流派，但某些增强器在其效果持续期间会改变它们所增强的幻术天赋的流派。",
	"Each augment's entry specifies which psionic talent you must currently be focusing on in order to manifest it. You cannot manifest an augment for one psionic talent while you are focusing on a different talent.": "每个增强物的条目都规定了你目前必须专注于哪个幻术天赋才能显现它。当你专注于一个不同的天赋时，你不能表现出一个幻术天赋的增强。",
	"Manifesting psionic powers does not expend spell slots. Instead, in order to augment a psionic talent, you must possess a reserve of potential psionic energy and expend a portion of it. This energy is represented by psi points. Casting a psionic talent cantrip does not expend psi points, but manifesting an augment does. Each psionic augment specifies the minimum number of psi points you must expend in order to manifest it.": "体现幻象能力并不消耗法术槽。相反，为了增强幻术天赋，你必须拥有潜在的幻术能量储备，并消耗其中的一部分。这种能量是用psi点数表示的。施放幻术天赋的咒语不会消耗psi点，但表现出增强的幻术会。每种幻术增强物都规定了你必须消耗的最小psi点数，以便显现它。",
	"The number of psi points available to you usually depends on your character level and your class or subclass. Your number of psi points can't go below 0, or over your maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest.": "你可以获得的psi点数通常取决于你的角色等级和你的等级或子等级。你的psi点数不能低于0，也不能超过你的最大值。当你完成长时间的休息后，你的psi点总数会恢复到最大值。",

If the psi cost of a psionic power is greater than your limit, you cannot manifest that power.": "你可以花在一个幻象能力的单一表现上的psi点数是有限的。这个限制通常取决于你的角色等级和你的等级或子等级，并在其中规定。你的种族，或者其他角色选项，比如特技，也可能指定一个psi限制。你对所有你知道的幻术效果的psi限制总是你所拥有的最高psi限制，无论来源如何，除非该来源对某些效果有特别限制。如果一个幻术效果的psi成本大于你的极限，你就不能表现出这种能力。",
	"The listed psi cost for all augments is a minimum. You may always choose to spend more psi points than an augment's minimum cost up to your limit, increasing the augment's power level by 1 for every 2 psi points beyond the minimum you spend.
