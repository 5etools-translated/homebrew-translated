If the target converses with you for the full manifesting time, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you insert in the target's mind the urge to do violence against one creature you name or describe to it. If the target sees that creature before the duration ends, it attacks the creature. If the target was already hostile towards the creature, it attacks using weapons or magic.

The revision might simply fail to take hold, the effect you desire might only be partially achieved, or you might suffer some undesirable outcome as the result of a runaway butterfly effect you failed to anticipate. For example, altering reality with the desire that all Inspired be wiped from the world might propel you centuries forward in time to a period after the age of Dal Quor has turned and destroyed all the quori—effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, revising reality such that you are in the possession of a legendary magic item might pull you to the location of the item's current owner, rather than transporting the item to you.": "你也许能够实现超出上述例子范围的东西。尽可能准确地向DM说明你所期望的对现实的修正。在这种情况下，DM有很大的自由度来决定发生什么；修正得越大，出错的可能性就越大。修正可能只是没有生效，你所期望的效果可能只是部分实现，或者你可能因为你没有预料到的失控的蝴蝶效应而遭受一些不理想的结果。例如，改变现实的愿望是将所有的灵感从世界上抹去，这可能会将你的时间推进到几个世纪前，在达尔-库尔的时代已经转向并摧毁了所有的库里--有效地将你从游戏中移除。同样地，修改现实，使你拥有一件传奇性的魔法物品，可能会把你拉到该物品当前主人的所在地，而不是把该物品运送给你。",
	"The stress of manifesting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power or spell taxes you mentally and physically. After enduring that stress, each time you manifest a power or cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take {@damage 1d10} psychic damage per level of that magical effect. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for {@dice 2d4} days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that the psi points you spent to manifest reality revision are permanently burned, reducing your maximum psi reserve by 18 points. This reduction cannot be reversed by mortal means, even with a {@spell wish|phb} spell or another reality revision, and it applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level.": "体现这种力量产生任何效果的压力，除了复制另一种力量或咒语之外，都会使你在精神和身体上付出代价。在承受了这种压力之后，每次你表现出一种力量或施放一个咒语，直到你完成一个长时间的休息，你都会在该魔法效果的每一级受到（%0%）的精神伤害。这种伤害不能以任何方式减少或预防。此外，你的力量会下降到3，如果它不是3或更低的话，持续（%1%）天。在这些日子里，你每休息一天，只做一些轻微的活动，你的剩余恢复时间就会减少2天。最后，有33%的机会，你为表现现实修正而花费的psi点数被永久地烧掉，使你的最大psi储备减少18点。这种减少无法通过凡人的方式逆转，即使是用{@spell wish|phb}的法术或另一个现实修正，它也适用于你因获得一个等级而获得的任何增加的最大psi储备。",

This power automatically fails if you are already on the Astral Plane when you manifest it.": "你带领一个由两个或更多自愿的神秘旅行者（受你之前展现的（%0%）力量影响的生物，其中一个必须是你自己）组成的商队进入星界和其他地方。当你展现这个力量时，你必须指定另一个存在的位面作为你的目的地（并可以选择该位面中的一个特定位置）。然后，所有神秘的旅行者都会被传送到星界，在那里你开始前往你的目的地。如果你在显现这个能力时已经在星界，那么这个能力会自动失效。",
	"Your journey through the Astral Plane is not instantaneous, instead taking several days, and arrival at your destination is not guaranteed. At the end of each day of astral travel, you must make a DC 15 Arcana check. Successes bring you closer to your destination and failures lead you further away. Your journey ends if you accrue either three successes or three failures. The DM may grant you disadvantage or advantage on these checks, depending on certain factors (the waxing or waning periods of your destination plane, your familiarity with your destination, etc.).": "你在星界的旅行不是瞬间完成的，而是需要几天的时间，并且不能保证到达目的地。在每天的星际旅行结束时，你必须进行DC15的阿卡纳检查。成功会使你更接近你的目的地，失败会使你更远。如果你有三次成功或三次失败，你的旅程就会结束。DM可能会在这些检查中给予你劣势或优势，这取决于某些因素（你的目的地平面的消长期，你对目的地的熟悉程度，等等）。",
	"The result of your journey depends on how many failures you accrued before it ends:": "你的旅程的结果取决于你在结束前累积了多少次失败。",
	"If your journey ends with no failures, all mystic travelers are transported to your intended plane of existence, within 1d10 miles of your destination on that plane if you specified one, or arriving at a random location on that plane if you did not.": "如果你的旅程没有失败，所有神秘的旅行者都会被传送到你预定的存在位面，如果你指定了一个位面，则在该位面的1d10英里内，如果你没有指定，则到达该位面的一个随机位置。",

	"If your journey ends with 2 failures, you are forced to turn back, arriving within 1d10 miles of the location you manifested this power. Additionally, all mystic travelers suffer four levels of {@condition exhaustion} as your astral journey was especially tiring and rough.": "如果你的旅程以2次失败告终，你将被迫折返，到达你显现此力量的地点的1d10英里内。此外，所有神秘的旅行者都会受到四级（%0%）的影响，因为你的星际旅行特别累人，而且很艰难。",
	"If your journey ends because you accrued 3 failures, all mystic travelers run afoul of turbulent psychic currents of the Astral Plane. Each mystic traveler must make a Charisma saving throw, taking {@damage 10d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Then, regardless of the result of the saving throw, each mystic traveler suffers two levels of {@condition exhaustion} and is transported to a random plane of existence, separated from its fellow travelers.": "如果你的旅程因为你累积了3次失败而结束，那么所有的神秘旅行者都会触犯星界的动荡的精神气流。每个神秘的旅行者都必须做一个魅力救赎，如果救赎失败，会受到（%0%）的精神伤害，如果救赎成功，会受到一半的伤害。然后，无论救赎的结果如何，每个神秘旅行者都会受到两级（%1%）的伤害，并被传送到一个随机的存在平面，与其他旅行者分开。",
	"In addition to the pure navigational challenge of the journey, the DM may describe additional encounters and challenges the mystic travelers might face along the way.": "除了旅程中纯粹的导航挑战之外，DM还可以描述神秘的旅行者在途中可能面临的额外遭遇和挑战。",
	"You manifest this power as a reaction to one creature teleporting into, out of, or within range. The teleporting creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to continue its teleport as normal. If the target fails its save, it teleports to a destination of your choice instead of its intended destination, provided the destination you choose is within the normal range of the teleportation effect.": "你表现出这种力量，作为对一个生物传送到、传送出、或传送到范围内的反应。被传送的生物必须在 \"魅力救赎 \"中获得成功，才能继续其正常的传送。如果目标没能救活，它就会被传送到你选择的目的地，而不是它预定的目的地，只要你选择的目的地是在传送效果的正常范围内。",
	"Your condition returns to what it was at the end of your previous turn, minus the psi cost of manifesting this power. You must maintain an accurate record of your hit points, psi points, uses remaining of features, and other pertinent information regarding your overall condition for the point at which you return. If you do not have an accurate record of such information, the power fails. This power only returns your inherent features to their previous state, it has no effect on your equipment, including magic items.": "你的状态会恢复到你上一回合结束时的状态，减去表现这种力量的psi成本。你必须对你的命中率、psi点数、特征的剩余使用量以及其他与你返回时的整体状况有关的信息保持准确的记录。如果你没有这些信息的准确记录，这个能力就会失败。这个能力只使你的固有特征恢复到以前的状态，对你的装备，包括魔法物品没有影响。",
	"You transport yourself backwards in time. The process of regressing yourself to an earlier point in time is exceedingly difficult and dangerous. If you are not in combat, you can attempt to travel backwards in time up to 8 hours, but if you manifest this power while in combat, you can only attempt to regress time back to the point at which you rolled for initiative at the start of the current combat. You must succeed on a psionic ability check against your own power save DC to successfully travel in time with this power. On a failure, you remain in the present moment, take {@damage 10d6} force damage that cannot be mitigated in any way, and the psi points you spent to manifest temporal regression are permanently burned, reducing your maximum psi reserve by 17 points. This reduction cannot be reversed by mortal means, even with a {@spell wish|phb} spell or the {@spell reality revision|Psions Primer} power and it applies to any increased maximum psi reserve you attain for gaining a level.": "你把自己的时间向后推移。将自己倒退到一个较早的时间点的过程是非常困难和危险的。如果你不在战斗中，你可以尝试将时间倒退到8小时以内，但如果你在战斗中表现出这种能力，你只能尝试将时间倒退到你在当前战斗开始时掷出主动权的那一刻。你必须对自己的力量保全DC进行幻象能力检查，才能成功地用这种力量进行时间旅行。如果失败，你就会停留在当下，受到{@damage 10d6}不能以任何方式减轻的力量伤害，并且你用来表现时间回归的psi点数被永久烧毁，你的最大psi储备减少17点。这种减少无法通过凡人的方式逆转，即使是用{@spell wish|phb}的法术或{@spell reality revision|Psions Primer}的力量，它也适用于你因获得一个等级而获得的任何增加的最大psi储备。",
	"When you travel back in time, only you retain knowledge of the future in which you lived, but small variances in random variables can produce different outcomes to the ones you might expect (for example, a game of chance or sporting event you witnessed the first time around might not result in the exact same outcome you first witnessed). The DM has the final call on the state of the world and the creatures in it after you manifest this power.": "当你穿越时空时，只有你保留了你所处的未来的知识，但随机变量的微小变异会产生与你可能预期的不同的结果（例如，你第一次目睹的机会游戏或体育赛事可能不会导致与你第一次目睹的完全相同的结果）。在你表现出这种能力之后，DM对世界的状态和其中的生物有最终决定权。",
	"Likewise, a combat that you return to the beginning of may have wildly different results, necessitating that the entire encounter be replayed.": "同样，你回到开始时的战斗可能会有截然不同的结果，因此有必要重演整个遭遇战。",
	"While you concentrate on this power, you know when a creature communicating with you via telepathy is lying.": "当你专注于这种能力时，你知道通过心灵感应与你交流的生物在说谎。",
	"When you manifest this augment, you begin communicating telepathically using {@spell mindlink|Psions Primer} with one additional target creature.": "当你表现出这个增强功能时，你开始用{@spell mindlink|Psions Primer}与另外一个目标生物进行心灵感应交流。",
	"In addition, for the duration of this augment, you can use a bonus action on your turn to share one memory of your choice with all targets of {@spell mindlink|Psions Primer}, or allow one target to share one of its memories with yourself and all other targets of {@spell mindlink|Psions Primer}. The recipients of a memory gain perfect recall of one thing the sender of the memory saw or did.": "此外，在这个增强的持续时间内，你可以在你的回合中使用一个额外的行动，与所有目标分享你选择的一个记忆（%0%），或者允许一个目标与你自己和所有其他目标分享其一个记忆（%1%）。记忆的接受者会获得对记忆发送者所见或所做的一件事的完美回忆。",

	"You couch your falsehoods in feelings of trust and acceptance, and deliver them into the mind of another. When you manifest this augment, you target one creature you are telepathically communicating with. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you telepathically communicate one statement of your choice to the target, and the target believes that statement for the duration. The statement can be up to ten words long, and it must describe you or a creature or object the target can see. On a successful save, the target is unaffected. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being {@condition charmed} or it succeeded on a saving throw against this augment since the end of your last long rest.": "你在信任和接受的感觉中掩饰你的谎言，并将它们传递到另一个人的头脑中。当你表现出这种增强功能时，你的目标是一个与你进行心灵感应的生物。目标必须做一个智慧拯救动作。如果救赎失败，你会用心灵感应向目标传达你选择的一句话，而目标会在持续时间内相信这句话。这句话最多可以有十个字，而且必须描述你或目标能看到的生物或物体。拯救成功后，目标不受影响。如果一个生物对 \"被 \"有免疫力（%0%），或者在你最后一次长时休息结束后，它对这个增强效果的救赎成功，那么它就对这个效果免疫。",
	"Your eyes flare in a moment of concentrated, telepathic anger, as you lash out at one creature you are telepathically communicating with. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 1d10} psychic damage and suffers disadvantage on its next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and does not suffer disadvantage from this augment.": "你的眼睛在集中的、心灵感应的愤怒中闪烁，你向一个与你心灵感应的生物发难。目标必须做一个魅力储蓄动作。如果救赎失败，它将受到{@damage 1d10}的精神伤害，并且在你下一回合结束前的下一次智力、智慧或魅力救赎中受到不利影响。拯救成功时，它将受到一半的伤害，并且不会受到此增强效果的不利影响。",
	"You broadcast a short telepathic message of up to 25-words to every creature within range. Any creature you can see, as well as any creatures that you know or know of in the area can be included or excluded from this communication. This communication is one-way only and instantaneous. If a recipient of your communication does not share a language with you, it perceives only garbled mental gibberish.": "你向范围内的每一个生物广播一条短的心灵感应信息，最多25个字。你能看到的任何生物，以及你认识的或知道的该地区的任何生物，都可以包括在或不包括在这种交流中。这种沟通只是单向的，而且是即时的。如果你的交流对象与你没有共同的语言，那么它只能感受到混乱的精神胡言乱语。",
	"When you manifest this augment, and as your action on each turn until your concentration ends, you can focus your mind on one creature you are telepathically communicating with.": "当你表现出这个增强功能时，作为你每个回合的行动，直到你的注意力结束，你可以把你的心思集中在一个与你进行心灵感应的生物上。",
	"When you initially begin to focus on a creature, you initially learn its surface thoughts—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, this power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind.": "当你最初开始关注一个生物时，你首先了解它的表面想法--它在那一刻最想做的事情。作为一个行动，你可以尝试更深入地探测同一个生物的思想。如果你深入探究，目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果它失败了，你就能洞察它的推理（如果有的话），它的情绪状态，以及在它心中占据重要位置的东西（比如它担心的、爱的或恨的东西）。如果它成功了，这个能力就会结束。无论怎样，目标都知道你在探究它的思想。",
	"Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.": "口头向目标生物提出的问题自然会形成它的思维过程，所以这种能力作为审讯的一部分特别有效。",
	"You probe the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must remain within 30 feet of you for the entire manifesting time, otherwise the augment fails. The target must make three Wisdom saving throws, and you learn information from it based on the number of saving throws it fails. The target may voluntarily fail any saves. If the target succeeds on all three saving throws, this power fails.": "你探测范围内你能看到的生物的思想。目标在整个显现时间内必须保持在你的30英尺范围内，否则增强效果就会失效。目标必须进行三次智慧救赎，你根据它失败的救赎次数从它那里了解信息。目标可以自愿不进行任何拯救。如果目标在三次蓄力中都成功了，这个能力就失败了。",
	"If the target fails any saves, you learn the details of events from the target's memories that it considers significant. With one failed saving throw, you learn such details from the past 12 hours; with two failed saving throws, you learn such details from the past 24 hours; and with three failed saving throws, you learn such details from the past 48 hours.": "如果目标的任何救赎失败，你会从目标的记忆中学习它认为重要的事件的细节。如果一次救赎失败，你会学到过去12小时内的这些细节；如果两次救赎失败，你会学到过去24小时内的这些细节；如果三次救赎失败，你会学到过去48小时内的这些细节。",
	"You telepathically infiltrate the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must remain within 30 feet of you for the entire manifesting time, otherwise the power fails. The target must make three Intelligence saving throws. You plant an idea or false memory in the creature's mind, the duration of which depends on the number of saving throws it fails.": "你以心灵感应的方式渗透到你能看到的范围内的生物的思想中。目标在整个显现时间内必须保持在你的30英尺范围内，否则力量就会失效。目标必须进行三次智力测验。你在该生物的脑海中植入一个想法或错误的记忆，其持续时间取决于它失败的拯救次数。",
	"You choose whether the idea or memory is trivial (such as \"I woke up 5 minutes late today\" or \"Griffons are majestic creatures\") or personality-defining (\"I deserted my unit in the war, causing their deaths, and I can barely live with the shame\" or \"Violence is never the answer, I will never touch a weapon again\").": "你可以选择这个想法或记忆是微不足道的（如 \"我今天晚起了5分钟 \"或 \"狮鹫是雄伟的生物\"）还是决定个性的（\"我在战争中抛弃了我的部队，导致他们死亡，我几乎无法忍受这种耻辱 \"或 \"暴力永远不是答案，我永远不会再碰武器\"）。",
	"With one failed saving throw, the idea or memory lasts for the next 4 hours. With two failed saving throws, it lasts for 24 hours. With three failed saving throws, it lasts for 48 hours.": "如果一次救赎失败，这个想法或记忆将持续4小时。两次蓄力失败，它将持续24小时。三次蓄力失败，它将持续48小时。",
	"If you spend 8 extra psi points to manifest this augment, you manifest it as an 8th-level power, its manifesting time is shortened to 1 minute, and the idea or memory lasts one week with one failed saving throw, one month with two failed saving throws, or is permanent with three failed saving throws.": "如果你花了8个额外的psi点数来表现这个强化，你会把它表现为一个8级的力量，它的表现时间缩短为1分钟，而且这个想法或记忆在一次救赎失败后会持续一周，两次救赎失败后会持续一个月，或者三次救赎失败后会永久存在。",
	"You mentally implant a suggested course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and a triggering event (such as \"when you awake two days from now\" or \"when you come within sixty feet of the local Countess\") to magically influence a creature you are telepathically communicating with. Creatures that can't be {@condition charmed} are immune to this effect.": "你在精神上植入一个建议的活动过程（限于一两句话）和一个触发事件（比如 \"当你两天后醒来 \"或 \"当你来到当地伯爵夫人的六十英尺范围内\"），以神奇地影响与你进行心灵感应的生物。不能被（%0%）的生物对这个效果免疫。",
	"When you manifest this power, the target must immediately make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target perceives a faint whisper intruding into its mind, but is not otherwise affected, and you know the suggestion did not take hold. On a failure, the suggestion and trigger are telepathically implanted in the target without their notice. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Suggesting the creature stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.": "当你表现出这种能力时，目标必须立即做一个智慧救赎动作。如果成功，目标会察觉到一个微弱的耳语闯入它的脑海，但不会受到其他影响，而且你知道这个暗示并没有生效。如果失败，暗示和触发器就会在目标身上以心灵感应的方式植入，而他们却没有注意到。暗示的措辞必须使行动过程听起来合理。建议生物刺伤自己，把自己扔到长矛上，自焚，或者做一些其他明显有害的行为，都会结束这个效果。",
	"Once the triggering condition is met, the target pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 8 hours after the triggering condition is met. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was influenced to do. The target will not be able to explain why it took the actions you compelled it to take after the suggestion is triggered and it will have no memory of the suggestion or trigger being implanted.": "一旦触发条件得到满足，目标就会尽其所能地追求你所描述的行动方案。触发条件满足后，建议的行动过程可以持续8小时。如果建议的活动可以在更短的时间内完成，当目标完成它被影响做的事情时，力量就会结束。暗示触发后，目标将无法解释为什么采取你蛊惑它的行动，而且它将没有关于暗示或触发被植入的记忆。",
	"Whenever the target creature finishes a long rest, it may repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success, though it will still not realize it was affected. If the triggering condition is not met before the power expires, the suggested activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the power ends.": "每当目标生物完成长期休息时，它可以重复智慧救赎的动作，如果成功则结束效果，不过它仍然不会意识到自己受到了影响。如果在力量失效前没有满足触发条件，建议的活动就不会进行。如果你或你的任何同伴伤害了目标，则力量结束。",
	"You delve into the depths of the mind of a creature you are telepathically communicating with. You gain limited access to the complete personal experience of the target, from fleeting memories of everyday events to life-defining moments. For the duration, you may use an action to learn the answer to one question that the target could answer. You do not actually converse with the creature, and need not share a language with it. You merely search the target's psyche for the information you seek and find it if it is present.": "你深入到与你进行心灵感应的生物的心灵深处。你可以有限地接触到目标的完整个人经历，从日常事件的短暂记忆到决定人生的时刻。在持续时间内，你可以使用一个行动来了解目标人物可以回答的一个问题的答案。你实际上并不与该生物交谈，也不需要与它共享一种语言。你只是在目标的心灵中搜索你所寻求的信息，如果它存在的话，你就能找到它。",
	"The target may refuse to give you access to an answer if it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw, but success on this saving throw does not end the power. You may continue to seek answers (either to the same question or a different one) in subsequent rounds of the effect, until the duration ends. This power ends early if the target moves out of range.": "目标可以拒绝让你获得答案，如果它的 \"魅力储蓄 \"成功的话，但这个储蓄的成功并不会终止这个力量。你可以在效果的后续回合中继续寻求答案（无论是同一个问题还是另一个问题），直到持续时间结束。如果目标移动到范围之外，这个能力就会提前结束。",
	"An {@condition unconscious} creature automatically provides you answers, but after you receive an answer from it, it may make a Wisdom saving throw if it has at least 1 hit point, becoming conscious on a success.": "一个{@condition unconscious}的生物会自动为你提供答案，但在你从它那里得到答案后，如果它至少有1个命中点，它可以进行智慧救赎，成功后会变得有意识。",
	"You touch one humanoid you are telepathically communicating with and infect it with a parasitic seed of your own psyche. The target must make a Charisma saving throw immediately when you manifest this power on it, and must then repeat the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest. If the target successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends and the parasitic seed fades away with no effect. If it fails its save three times, the parasitic seed of your psyche in the target's mind germinates. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.": "你接触一个与你有心灵感应的人，用你自己精神的寄生种子感染它。当你在目标身上表现出这种力量时，它必须立即做一个 \"魅力救赎\"，然后在它完成长时间休息时必须重复这个救赎。如果目标成功地对这个力量进行了三次救赎，这个力量就会结束，寄生的种子也会消逝，没有任何影响。如果它救赎失败三次，你的精神寄生种子就会在目标的头脑中发芽。成功和失败不需要是连续的；保持对两者的追踪，直到目标收集到三个同类的。",
	"While a creature is still making saves against this power, it acts normally but begins to mimic quirks of your own personality. For instance, if you have a habit of ending sentences with \"y'know?\" the target begins doing so as well, subconsciously.": "当一个生物仍在对这种力量进行救赎时，它的行为是正常的，但开始模仿你自己性格的怪癖。例如，如果你有以 \"你知道吗？\"结束句子的习惯，目标也会下意识地开始这样做。",
	"If the parasitic seed germinates, the target's mind is replaced with a duplicate of your own. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match yours at the time you manifested this power on it. The target loses all class levels and class specific NPC traits it might have, and gains the class levels you had 8 levels ago (in effect, gaining the same experience and abilities you had 8 levels earlier). Its physical ability scores, race, and appearance do not change.": "如果寄生种子发芽，目标的思想会被替换成你自己的复制品。它的智力、智慧和魅力分数会改变，与你在它身上表现出这种力量时的分数相一致。目标失去了它可能拥有的所有等级和特定等级的NPC特征，而获得你8级之前的等级（实际上，获得了你8级之前的相同经验和能力）。它的物理能力分数、种族和外观不会改变。",
	"Although the target becomes a mental duplicate of you, you have no special control over it, and its personality may diverge from yours over time. The duplicate psyche's initial attitude toward you is friendly, but it does not believe itself to be your servant or slave, and it will act as you would if it is treated as such.": "虽然目标成为你的精神复制体，但你对它没有特别的控制权，而且它的个性可能会随着时间的推移而与你产生分歧。复制的精神体最初对你的态度是友好的，但它不认为自己是你的仆人或奴隶，如果它被当作仆人或奴隶对待，它会像你那样行动。",
	"Effects that prevent possession prevent you from infecting a target with mind seed, but grant no protection once the seed is already implanted. An intensified {@spell revitalization|Psions Primer}, {@spell greater restoration|Psions Primer}, or the break enchantment effect of {@spell dispel evil and good|Psions Primer} cast on the target specifically to cleanse it of a growing mind seed does so only if the caster succeeds on a spellcasting or psionic ability check with a DC equal to your power save DC, and only if cast on the target before it fails three saves against mind seed.": "防止附身的效果可以防止你用心灵种子感染目标，但一旦种子已经植入，就不会给予保护。强化的{@spell revitalization|Psions Primer}、{@spell greater restoration|Psions Primer}或{@spell dispel evil and good|Psions Primer}的破除魔法效果是为了清除目标身上正在生长的心灵种子，只有当施法者成功地进行魔法或幻术能力检查，其DC等于你的力量保存DC，并且只有在目标对心灵种子的三次拯救失败之前施法。",
	"Once the parasitic seed of your psyche germinates in a target, only {@spell reality revision|Psions Primer}, {@spell wish|phb}, {@spell psychic chirurgery|Psions Primer}, or similarly powerful magical effects can restore the target to its original personality and class levels (if applicable).": "一旦你心灵的寄生种子在目标体内发芽，只有{@spell reality revision|Psions Primer}、{@spell wish|phb}、{@spell psychic chirurgery|Psions Primer}或类似的强大魔法效果才能将目标恢复到其原有的人格和等级（如果适用）。",
	"You telepathically enter the mind of a willing creature you touch, and skillfully repair or improve its psyche. When you manifest this power, you choose one of the following effects.": "你以心灵感应的方式进入你所接触到的自愿的生物的心灵，并巧妙地修复或改善其心灵。当你表现出这种能力时，你可以选择以下效果之一。",
	"If the target is {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}, you instantly end those conditions on the target. You also automatically end any effect that mentally limits or dictates actions the creature can take (such as {@spell id insinuation|Psions Primer}, {@spell ego whip|Psions Primer}, or the {@spell command|phb} or {@spell confusion|phb} spells), possession, permanent insanity, madness, or a reduction in maximum hit points caused by an effect that dealt psychic damage. Additionally you restore the creature's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores to normal if they were reduced by another effect.": "如果目标是{@condition charmed}或{@condition frightened}，你立即结束目标身上的这些状况。你也会自动结束任何在精神上限制或支配生物可以采取的行动的效果（例如（%2%）、（%3%）、或（%4%）或（%5%）的法术）、附身、永久精神错乱、疯狂、或由造成精神伤害的效果所造成的最大命中率降低。此外，如果该生物的智力、智慧和魅力分数被其他效果降低，你会将它们恢复到正常。",
	"If you choose this effect, you begin to concentrate. If you maintain your concentration for a full minute, you permanently bestow the target creature with the ability to cast one psionic talent that you know, or the {@spell wild talent|Psions Primer} power.
