	"Though many of the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons are filled with strife, from dragon attacks, to bandit attacks, to evil liches luring the living into their lairs to join their undead armies, it's important to remember that there are still times of joy and revelry. Calendars are dotted with holidays to honor deities or celebrate important historic events. Carnivals travel between cities and towns across the land, bringing performers, games, and attractions for all manner of folk to enjoy.": "尽管《龙与地下城》的许多世界都充满了纷争，从龙的攻击，到强盗的攻击，再到邪恶的地衣引诱活人进入他们的巢穴加入他们的不死军团，但重要的是要记住，仍然有欢乐和狂欢的时刻存在。日历上点缀着纪念神灵或庆祝重要历史事件的节日。嘉年华会在全国各地的城市和城镇之间穿梭，带来表演者、游戏和景点，供所有类型的人享受。",
	"Festivals, Feasts & Fairs is intended to help you turn your \"pleasant downtime\" into a fully interactive experience for your adventuring party. Instead of rolling a dice on a simple chart to see if they got sick from eating fair food or won a pet goldfish in a game, you can create a colorful environment full of activities, NPCs, and plot hooks.": "节日、盛宴和集市》旨在帮助你把 \"愉快的休息时间 \"变成你的冒险队伍的完全互动体验。你可以创造一个充满活动、NPC和情节钩子的丰富多彩的环境，而不是在一个简单的图表上掷骰子，看他们是否因为吃了集市食品而生病，或者在游戏中赢得一条宠物金鱼。",
	"A festival or holiday can help introduce your players to a new town or culture. You can learn a lot about people by observing what, why, and how they celebrate. Instead of waiting for the party to poke and prod at NPCs to learn about their surroundings, much of it is proudly on display, or even shoved directly in front of them.": "一个节日或假期可以帮助你的玩家介绍一个新的城镇或文化。你可以通过观察他们庆祝的内容、原因和方式来了解人们的很多情况。与其等着当事人去打探NPC来了解他们周围的情况，很多东西都是骄傲地展示出来的，甚至直接塞到他们面前。",
	"Holidays mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. In a modern age, it can become easy to be soured by ideas of commercialism, unpleasant social obligation, and working through the holiday. It's important to remember that in \"simpler times\", holidays carried a very different meaning for most folk who celebrated them. Though you can include a grumpy \"bah, humbug\" misanthrope or two in your setting, holidays and festivals are celebrated because they are loved by the masses, and they should be described with as much positive language as you can muster. Even if you have a scrooge or two at your table, you can still draw them into the spirit of the event.": "节日对很多不同的人意味着很多不同的事情。在现代，人们很容易被商业主义、令人不快的社会义务和通过假期工作的想法所影响。重要的是要记住，在 \"更简单的时代\"，对于大多数庆祝节日的人来说，节日具有非常不同的意义。虽然你可以在你的设定中加入一两个脾气暴躁的 \"呸，哼 \"厌世者，但节日和庆典之所以被庆祝，是因为它们受到大众的喜爱，而且应该用尽可能多的积极语言来描述它们。即使你的桌子上有一两个守财奴，你仍然可以把他们吸引到活动的精神中。",
	"Throughout this guide, you'll find infoboxes. Two boxes in particular are the \"Rule Of Cool\" and the \"Rule Of Good Taste.\"": "在本指南中，你会发现一些信息框。其中有两个盒子是 \"酷的规则 \"和 \"良好品味的规则\"。",
	"{@b Rule Of Cool} infoboxes highlight opportunities in which you can help your players feel as though they've achieved something especially awesome. Sometimes it's a note to let you plan ahead in case they go an unexpected direction, and sometimes it's a hidden mechanic of a contest or game that they may unknowingly stumbleupon. These \"cinematic\" moments in which a character gets to appear \"cool\" can turn into the moments your players will always remember.": "{@b Rule Of Cool}信息框强调了一些机会，在这些机会中，你可以帮助你的玩家感觉到他们已经取得了一些特别了不起的成就。有时它是一个说明，让你提前计划，以防他们走向一个意想不到的方向，有时它是一个竞赛或游戏的隐藏机制，他们可能在不知不觉中偶然发现。这些 \"电影化 \"的时刻，一个角色得到了 \"酷 \"的表现，可以变成你的玩家永远记得的时刻。",
	"{@b Rule Of Good Taste} infoboxes highlight stumbling blocks that may trip up some DMs. History is fraught with failings of basic human decency, and many \"classic\" features of carnivals and circuses that may come to mind can be considered terribly offensive today, including but not limited to the concept of \"freak shows\".": "{@b Rule Of Good Taste}信息框强调了可能绊倒一些DM的绊脚石。历史充满了对人类基本礼节的缺失，许多可能出现在脑海中的狂欢节和马戏团的 \"经典 \"特征在今天可能被认为是非常令人反感的，包括但不限于 \"怪胎秀 \"的概念。",
	"We'll be using a lot of terms for different kinds of celebrations and communal activities. Though some terms can be used interchangeably, some also carry specific connotations.": "我们将使用很多术语来描述不同种类的庆祝活动和公共活动。虽然有些术语可以互换使用，但有些术语也带有特定的内涵。",
	"A collection of amusement shows and activities, often of the transient variety. A travelling carnival moves from location to location, setting up in a new place for a few days or a few weeks. Often, carnivals strike deals with towns and cities in order to set up carnivals during locally recognized celebrations or holidays. Carnivals often include food and merchandise vendors, games of luck, competitions of skill, and acts by humanoid or animal performers.": "一系列的娱乐节目和活动，通常是临时性的。巡回嘉年华会从一个地方移动到另一个地方，在一个新的地方设立几天或几周的时间。通常，嘉年华会与城镇达成协议，以便在当地公认的庆祝活动或节日期间举办嘉年华会。嘉年华会通常包括食品和商品供应商、运气游戏、技能竞赛，以及人形或动物表演者的表演。",
	"A circus is focused on a performance within a large tent, rather than a variety of tents and booths. Sometimes a part of a carnival, and sometimes an independent act, a circus features performances by humanoids and animals in a wide variety of forms. Though a circus may set up and perform for several days or even weeks, they will have scheduled shows rather than nonstop entertainment.": "马戏团的重点是在一个大帐篷内的表演，而不是各种帐篷和摊位。马戏团有时是狂欢节的一部分，有时是独立的行为，其特点是由人类和动物以各种各样的形式进行表演。尽管一个马戏团可能会在几天甚至几周的时间里进行表演，但他们会有预定的节目，而不是不停地进行娱乐。",
	"Unlike a carnival or circus, a fair is usually put together by the local population of a town or city without contracting outside performers. As such, it will take on a much more \"homey\" feel, focusing on agriculture, animal husbandry, and local crafts and talents.": "与嘉年华会或马戏团不同，集市通常是由一个城镇的当地居民举办的，没有与外部表演者签约。因此，它将呈现出更多的 \"家庭 \"感觉，侧重于农业、畜牧业以及当地的手工艺和人才。",
	"A large meal or banquet held on a holiday in celebration. Though not every group of people has the economic freedom to throw a banquet, \"feasting\" for some could simply mean a communal meal or a special dish associated with the holiday. In some parlance, a \"feast day\" may not even involve food, and instead is related more closely to the term festival.": "在某个节日举行的大餐或宴会，以示庆祝。虽然不是每一群人都有举办宴会的经济自由，但对一些人来说，\"盛宴 \"可能仅仅意味着集体用餐或与节日有关的特殊菜肴。在一些说法中，\"盛宴日 \"甚至可能不涉及食物，而是与节日这个词更密切相关。",
	"A communal celebration. Not strictly limited to holidays, festivals may also be held to celebrate events such as the birth of a royal heir, the changing of seasons, troops returning home from war, or the homecoming of a famed local figure after a journey.": "一个集体的庆祝活动。严格来说，节日并不局限于节假日，也可以为庆祝一些事件而举行，如皇室继承人的出生、季节的变化、军队从战争中返回家园，或当地著名人物在旅行后的归来。",
	"Derived from the term \"holy day\", a holiday is any day or period of time in which most people are released from work obligations. Holidays need not always have a religious background, and may be of secular nature, or held in remembrance of historical events or mortal figures. Feel free to mix-and-match the materials in this book. A local agricultural fair could still host a fun house, set up by the local craftsmen. A circus might still host a strongman contest, to entertain their audience outside of the tent before the show lets in. A holiday celebration might hold a drinking contest or a pie eating contest as part of the practice of communal feasting. If you're the one designing your celebrations, then there are no limits to them.": "节日源于 \"圣日 \"一词，是指大多数人免除工作义务的任何一天或一段时期。节日不一定都有宗教背景，可以是世俗性质的，也可以是为纪念历史事件或凡人而举行的。请自由搭配本书中的材料。当地的农业博览会仍然可以举办一个由当地工匠搭建的游乐场。马戏团可能仍然会举办壮士比赛，在演出开始前在帐篷外为观众提供娱乐。节日庆祝活动可能会举办饮酒比赛或吃馅饼比赛，作为公共宴席做法的一部分。如果你是设计你的庆祝活动的人，那么它们就没有限制。",
	"There are no limits on scale. You could run a city-wide carnival in a metropolis like Waterdeep, with entire streets dedicated to festivities. You could also create a holiday celebrated only in a small town (Chapter 10, Designing Custom Holidays). You might also simply set up a roadside tent with a fortune teller, to provide a touch of foreshadowing to your party, and give them some guidance to get their meandering back on track (Chapter 6, Visiting The Fortune Teller). While this guide is primarily written with the Dungeon Master in mind, there are useful player resources to be had within. Chapter 9 focuses on backgrounds, allowing DMs and players alike to construct characters who have lived their lives embedded in the culture of carnivals, circuses, and performing.": "在规模上没有限制。你可以在Waterdeep这样的大都市举办全城的狂欢节，整个街道都是节日。你也可以创造一个只在小镇上庆祝的节日（第十章，设计自定义节日）。你也可以简单地在路边搭一个帐篷，里面有一个算命先生，为你的队伍提供一丝预示，并给他们一些指导，让他们的游荡回到正轨（第6章，拜访算命先生）。虽然本指南主要是以地下城主为中心编写的，但其中也有一些有用的玩家资源。第9章侧重于背景，让管理员和玩家都能构建那些生活在狂欢节、马戏团和表演文化中的角色。",
	"There are a million methods of merry-making to be made, and while they can't all be covered in a single book, the hope is that this document will give you enough inspiration to create holidays, festivals, and events that seem to overflow with culture and excitement. Festivals, Feasts & Fairs is not an adventure or a package of pre-made NPCs and dungeons. Instead, it is a collection of resources designed to inspire you. No one knows your players and their needs better than you do, so think about what they would most enjoy out of this book. Have fun!": "有无数种欢乐的方法，虽然它们不可能在一本书中全部涵盖，但我们希望这份文件能给你足够的灵感，让你创造出似乎洋溢着文化和兴奋的节日、节庆和活动。节日、盛宴和集市不是一个冒险，也不是一个预制NPC和地牢的包。相反，它是一个旨在激发你的资源的集合。没有人比你更了解你的玩家和他们的需求，所以要考虑他们最喜欢这本书中的什么。祝你玩得开心!",
	"Adventurers live very unique lives, in that they have more opportunities to travel and visit new lands than average folk. Even nobles may travel in a limited scope, and only see a small picture view of the lands and cultures they encounter. For most people, the only opportunity to travel and see the world without the dangers and demands of adventuring, is to join the circus.": "冒险家的生活非常独特，因为他们比普通人有更多机会旅行和访问新的土地。即使是贵族也可能在有限的范围内旅行，只能看到他们所遇到的土地和文化的一个小画面。对于大多数人来说，唯一的机会是加入马戏团，在没有冒险的危险和要求的情况下，去旅行和看世界。",
	"Many circus performances throughout history have relied on the exhibition of \"freaks\", or rather, people with unusual appearances. Often, this included people who were exceptionally tall or exceptionally short, fat people, people of different ethnicities, or people who suffered some sort of physical deformity. As modern sensitivities have developed, we've accepted that this can be a very harmful mistreatment of people who suffer from disability or deformity, and the practice of paying to view a \"freak\" contributed to their dehumanization.": "历史上许多马戏团的表演都依赖于 \"怪人 \"的展示，或者说，具有不寻常外表的人。通常，这包括特别高或特别矮的人、胖子、不同种族的人，或遭受某种身体畸形的人。随着现代敏感性的发展，我们已经接受，这可能是对患有残疾或畸形的人非常有害的虐待，而付费观看 \"怪胎 \"的做法促成了他们的非人化。",
	"If you want to keep your carnival setting tasteful, try to avoid classic characters like \"the fat lady\", \"the giant\", \"conjoined twins\" or \"the bearded lady\" (who may not even be out of the ordinary depending on how your setting handles dwarven physiology). Instead focus on performers who actively do things, or capitalize on an appearance that they chose for themselves, such as extreme body modification. Giving a person agency in their lives can make a big difference in the way they are portrayed.": "如果你想让你的狂欢节设置保持品味，尽量避免像 \"胖女人\"、\"巨人\"、\"连体婴儿 \"或 \"大胡子女人 \"这样的经典人物（根据你的设置如何处理矮人的生理结构，他们甚至可能不出格）。相反，要关注那些积极做事的表演者，或者利用他们为自己选择的外表，例如极端的身体改造。赋予一个人在生活中的代理权可以使他们的形象大为改观。",
	"From tightrope walking, to tumbling, to trapeze, and any other variety of dextrous bodily performance, acrobats steal the show. The earliest recorded performances involved acrobats performing feats of limberness and balance while riding on the backs of bulls, or balancing on their hands while firing bows and arrows with their feet. Today, ingenuity and creativity have lead to acrobats performing on rings, ropes, or swaths of silk suspended from ceilings, tree limbs, and tent posts, high above the heads of an awe-struck audience.": "从走钢丝到翻跟头，再到空中飞人，以及其他各种灵活的身体表演，杂技演员抢尽了风头。最早的表演记录涉及杂技演员在骑在公牛背上时进行的柔韧和平衡的表演，或在用脚发射弓箭时用手保持平衡。今天，独创性和创造性已经导致杂技演员在天花板、树枝和帐篷柱上悬挂的吊环、绳索或丝绸上进行表演，高高在上，令观众惊叹不已。",
	"The best performers are the ones the onlookers don't realize are putting on a show. Carnies, or \"showies\" as some may call them, are responsible for setting up equipment, running games, vending food and toys, and every other requirement of making the carnival actually work. They may make themselves obvious by calling passersbys to try their hand at games or competitions, or keep themselves scarce when setting up equipment, props, and decor for upcoming performances. Carnies are the backbone of the carnival, and are also a playable background (see pg. 22).": "最好的表演者是那些旁观者没有意识到在表演的人。卡尼们，或者有些人称他们为 \"表演者\"，负责设置设备、运行游戏、出售食物和玩具，以及使嘉年华会实际运作的所有其他要求。他们可能会通过召集路人参加游戏或比赛来显露自己的身份，或者在为即将到来的表演设置设备、道具和装饰时保持沉默。车夫是嘉年华会的骨干，也是一个可玩的背景（见第22页）。",
	"Though perhaps not as eye-catching as many of the other performers, the ringmaster has an extremely important duty. Functioning as the \"master of ceremonies\", they are essentially using their charisma to pull off a massive feat of \"sleight of hand\". Though a performance may come across as snappy or explosive, most performances require some degree of setup to perform properly and safely. Thus, the ringmaster guides the audience's attention away from a trick being set up or broken down, and toward a new highlight of entertainment.": "虽然可能不像其他许多表演者那样引人注目，但司仪有一个极其重要的职责。作为 \"司仪\"，他们基本上是利用自己的魅力来完成一个巨大的 \"魔术 \"壮举。虽然一个表演可能会表现得很爽快或很有爆发力，但大多数表演都需要一定程度的设置才能正常和安全地进行。因此，司仪将观众的注意力从正在设置或分解的魔术上转移到新的娱乐亮点上。",
	"While acrobats and gymnasts may perform feats that require flexibility, a contortionist specializes in being able to twist their body into knots. Most contortionists specialize in frontbending or back-bending, and some may also practice displays of contorting to fit within small spaces (like a box or trunk), or dislocating joints (\"bone-breaking\" to the uninformed).": "杂技演员和体操运动员可能会表演需要柔韧性的节目，而柔术师的专长是能够将身体扭曲成结。大多数柔术师擅长前屈或后屈，有些人还可能练习在狭小的空间（如箱子或树干）内变形，或使关节脱臼（不知情的人称之为 \"断骨\"）的展示。",
	"In a world where \"breathing fire\" is relegated to the realms of Dragonborn or magic (Potion of Fire Breath, DMG pg. 187), fire breathers and fire eaters must draw particular attention to the fact that they utilize no magic in the performing of their arts. Furthermore, while a Dragonborn may utilize breath weapons, even a fire-breathing sort is not immune to fire, making the supposed \"eating\" of flame still impressive. In reality, what they do requires very little special equipment, but instead a great deal of practice and a slightly more advanced knowledge of the sciences than most people (IE \"heat rises\", \"fire requires oxygen\", and so on).": "在这个世界上，\"喷火 \"被归为龙族或魔法的范畴（喷火药水，DMG第187页），喷火者和吃火者必须特别注意他们在表演他们的艺术时没有利用魔法。此外，虽然龙裔可以使用呼吸武器，但即使是喷火者也不能对火免疫，这使得所谓的 \"吃 \"火焰仍然令人印象深刻。实际上，他们所做的事情几乎不需要什么特殊的设备，而是需要大量的练习和比大多数人略微高级的科学知识（IE \"热量上升\"，\"火需要氧气\"，等等）。",
	"Generally speaking, a magician by themselves is not going to be particularly interesting in most settings. Unless you're working from a \"low magic\" setting in which common folk know of the existence of magic and yet rarely ever see it, your magicians will either have to pull off extraordinary feats, or appear to break known laws of magic.": "一般来说，在大多数情况下，魔术师本身不会特别有趣。除非你是在一个 \"低魔法 \"的环境中工作，普通人知道魔法的存在，但却很少看到它，否则你的魔术师要么必须完成非凡的壮举，要么看起来要打破已知的魔法规律。",
	"Shabbily dressed performers who carry on simple plays. The most classic play revolves around two combatants fighting each other to the death, such as a knight and a dragon, and a quack doctor who comes along to revive the fallen loser. Mummers deliver their narratives in rhyming couplets, and the plays generally do not require any special scenery or props beyond what the actors can carry on their person. This form of amateur acting is so popular and widespread that mummers are also a playable background (see pg. 23).": "衣着简陋的表演者，进行简单的戏剧表演。最经典的剧目是围绕着两个战斗人员的生死搏斗，如骑士和龙，以及一个前来救治失败者的庸医。姆默斯人用押韵的对联进行叙述，除了演员可以随身携带的东西外，戏剧一般不需要任何特殊的场景或道具。这种形式的业余表演非常流行和广泛，以至于姆默斯也是一种可玩的背景（见第23页）。",
	"Large, muscular men (or women, or anything really) who perform great feats of strength before an audience. Though extraordinarily strong creatures exist in the world, the strongman's performance hinges on convincing their audience that no ordinary person could do what they do. They most often secure this point by inviting a member of the audience to attempt the feat of strength first, and fail at it. Sometimes, the audience member is a \"plant\" (a carnie pretending to be an ordinary commoner) who is in on the gimmick, and knows how to fail spectacularly enough in front of an audience that even a rigged \"feat of strength\" could appear convincing.": "大块的、肌肉发达的男人（或女人，或任何东西，真的）在观众面前表现出巨大的力量。虽然世界上存在特别强壮的生物，但强人的表演取决于让观众相信没有一个普通人能做到他们所做的。他们通常通过邀请一名观众首先尝试力量的壮举并失败来确保这一点。有时，这个观众是一个 \"植物人\"（假装成普通人的卡尼），他参与了这个噱头，并知道如何在观众面前足够壮观地失败，即使是一个被操纵的 \"力量壮举 \"也会显得令人信服。",
	"Humanoid talents are not the only attraction of a circus or carnival. Though most people live in relatively close proximity to animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc), their pets or beasts of burden are generally trained only for specific tasks. Thus, the draw of \"a dog who can count\" or a horse who performs tricks can draw many to buy a ticket.": "人形人才不是马戏团或狂欢节的唯一吸引力。虽然大多数人生活在相对接近动物（狗、猫、马等）的地方，但他们的宠物或野兽一般只为特定任务而训练。因此，\"会数数的狗 \"或会表演技巧的马的抽奖可以吸引很多人买票。",
	"Performances of trained animals can take on many forms. The most classic examples may consist of dogs playing leapfrog, lions jumping through hoops, or elephants lifting humanoid gymnastic performers on their trunks. However, in a magical world, these marvelous feats of training might take on entirely different connotations. Druids using Speak With Animals can simply ask a bear to stand up and hold still while they balance a stack of spinning plates on his head. Animal training now becomes more of a matter of making friends and building trust, without having to worry about communicating what you want to a creature that can't understand.": "训练有素的动物的表演可以有多种形式。最经典的例子可能包括狗玩跳跃游戏，狮子跳圈，或大象用树干举起人形体操表演者。然而，在一个魔法世界里，这些奇妙的训练壮举可能具有完全不同的内涵。使用 \"与动物对话 \"的德鲁伊可以简单地要求一只熊站起来并保持不动，而他们在熊的头上平衡一摞旋转的盘子。动物训练现在变得更像是一个交朋友和建立信任的问题，而不必担心向一个无法理解的生物传达你想要什么。",
	"On the other hand, a polymorph spell could simply allow a humanoid who's learned their choreography to appear to be an especially well-trained animal. Keep in mind that, depending on how \"low magic\" or \"high magic\" your setting is, commoners may be considerably more impressed with animal tricks than an adventurer who's aware of such spells might be. If magic is commonplace in your setting, your circus performers may have to pull off considerably more impressive feats of animal training in order to wow their crowds.": "另一方面，一个多面体法术可以简单地让一个学会了他们编排的人形生物看起来是一个特别训练有素的动物。请记住，根据你的设定是 \"低魔法 \"还是 \"高魔法\"，平民可能比了解此类法术的冒险者对动物表演的印象要好得多。如果魔法在你的环境中很普遍，你的马戏团表演者可能不得不在动物训练方面做出更多令人印象深刻的壮举，以使他们的观众惊叹。",
	"Sometimes, it's not what an animal can do that is impressive, but merely their presence that can inspire awe and wonder in onlookers. Many common folk with live their entire lives within a relatively short distance of where they were born, and will never have the opportunity to travel abroad and see exotic creatures. When the menagerie comes into town, they'll be able to see all manner of wild creatures that they've only ever heard of in stories.": "有时，令人印象深刻的不是动物能做什么，而仅仅是它们的存在能激发旁观者的敬畏和惊奇。许多普通人一生都生活在他们出生地相对较短的距离内，永远没有机会到国外旅行，看到异国的生物。当动物园进城时，他们就能看到他们只在故事中听说过的各种野生动物。",
	"There's a significant difference between a travelling menagerie and one that is stationary. A single location (sometimes called an animal park or zoological garden) will often make efforts to display animals in environments similar to their native homes. Various feats of magic, technology, or simply importing flora from the animal's place of origin, may be used to accomplish this. Travelling menageries, however, are often limited to placing animals in cages small enough to be transported on wagons.": "旅行动物园和固定的动物园之间有很大区别。一个单一的地点（有时被称为动物公园或动物园）通常会努力在类似于其原生地的环境中展示动物。为了达到这个目的，可以使用各种魔法、技术，或者干脆从动物的原产地进口植物。然而，旅行动物园通常只限于将动物放在足够小的笼子里，以便用马车运输。",
	"Whatever form a menagerie takes, it generally is not as ideal as letting animals roam comfortably in their wild homes. For this reason, some people (especially those of the druidic persuasion) may be opposed to the practice of keeping animals captive for the amusement of humanoids. On the other hand, some menageries may fake their exotic display by utilizing magic, ranging from illusions to polymorphed entertainers.": "无论动物园采取什么形式，它通常都不如让动物在它们的野外家园舒适地漫游来得理想。因此，有些人（尤其是德鲁伊教派的人）可能会反对将动物圈养起来供人类娱乐的做法。另一方面，一些动物园可能会利用魔法来伪造其异国情调的展示，从幻觉到多面体的艺人。",
	"Though seeing an exotic animal from afar can be an amazing experience for many common folk, nothing quite beats being able to touch, feed, and pet an animal. However, putting wild animals and untrained people in close proximity to one another can be a dangerous gamble. For this reason, petting zoos often have to strike a balance between wild animals and safe animals. Interestingly enough, petting zoos can be more interesting to noble children than they would be to commoner children. Nobles will have more opportunities to travel and see exotic animals that a commoner would never see, but most commoners will deal with livestock on a relatively regular basis. Thus, a noble child may be enamoured with the opportunity to pet a pig or feed a goat, whereas a child raised on a farm would find nothing special about it.": "尽管对许多普通人来说，从远处看到异国动物是一种神奇的体验，但没有什么比能够触摸、喂养和抚摸动物更有意义的了。然而，把野生动物和未经训练的人放在一起，可能是一场危险的赌博。出于这个原因，宠物动物园通常必须在野生动物和安全动物之间取得平衡。有趣的是，对贵族儿童来说，宠物园可能比对平民儿童更有趣。贵族会有更多的机会去旅行，看到平民永远看不到的异国动物，但大多数平民会相对经常地与牲畜打交道。因此，一个贵族的孩子可能会迷上抚摸猪或喂羊的机会，而一个在农场长大的孩子会觉得这没什么特别的。",
	"Inspired by the \"carosella\", meaning \"little battle\", which originated as a cavalry training exercise. Originally, mounted soldiers would gallop in circles while tossing balls to one another, forcing them to sharpen their riding skills. The sight of armored knights on horseback was so enthralling to children, that the concept of the carousel was born. At a carousel, horses are tethered to a center post, so that they can only walk in a circular track. The horses may be covered in ornate finery, displaying colorful bridles and barding, and some horses may be ridden by costumed performers to carry on the illusion that children are riding among nobles or knights. Always seeking to stand out from the crowd, some carousel proprietors experiment with other creatures, such as camels, elephants, or riding mastiffs. The creativity of their mounts is limited only by the safety of the wild creatures they're dealing with. Some have also been known to affix fake horns to a horse's ornate head tack, in order to market themselves as having a carousel of unicorns. ": "灵感来自于 \"carosella\"，意思是 \"小战斗\"，它起源于一种骑兵训练。最初，骑马的士兵会绕着圈子飞奔，同时互相抛球，迫使他们磨练骑术。马背上的盔甲骑士的景象让孩子们非常着迷，因此旋转木马的概念应运而生。在旋转木马上，马匹被拴在一个中心柱子上，因此它们只能在一个圆形轨道上行走。马匹可能覆盖着华丽的装饰，展示着五颜六色的辔头和护套，有些马匹可能由化装的表演者骑着，以延续儿童在贵族或骑士中骑马的幻觉。为了从人群中脱颖而出，一些旋转木马的经营者尝试使用其他生物，如骆驼、大象或骑獒。他们的坐骑的创造力只受限于他们所面对的野生动物的安全。有些人还知道在马的华丽头饰上贴上假角，以推销自己拥有独角兽的旋转木马。",
	"Among the many structures set up at a carnival, the funhouse is perhaps the most eclectic of all. The entire premise of a funhouse is that it's fully enclosed, and people on the outside will pay to sate their curiosity of whatever lays within. The interior of a funhouse can take on many themes or present many experiences.": "在嘉年华会的众多建筑中，游乐场可能是最不拘一格的。游乐场的整个前提是它是完全封闭的，外面的人可以花钱来满足他们对里面的东西的好奇心。游乐场的内部可以有许多主题或呈现许多体验。",
	"{@b Hall Of Mirrors} - A simple \"maze\" of mirrored walls, presenting a challenge of traversal simply by the fact there are so many optical illusions. Many of the mirrors are warped, and will present the illusion that people are taller, shorter, thinner, or broader in their reflection. More wealthy carnivals may be able to afford magic mirrors that present more elaborate reflections, such as showing the viewer what they looked like in their youth, or what they might look like as a warrior, a royal, etc.": "{@b Hall Of Mirrors} - 一个由镜子组成的简单的 \"迷宫\"，仅仅因为有这么多的视觉错觉而带来了穿越的挑战。许多镜子都是扭曲的，会呈现出人更高、更矮、更瘦或更宽的错觉。更富裕的嘉年华会可能有能力购买魔镜，以呈现更多精心制作的反射，例如向观众展示他们年轻时的样子，或者他们作为战士、皇室成员的样子，等等。",
	"{@b Haunted House} - A themed funhouse that is presented as being \"haunted\", in which various contraptions or costumed actors attempt to scare or startle those passing through. Though still fully enclosed, a \"haunted\" funhouse will have many darkened windows or thinner walls, to allow the screams of the horrified audience to echo outward, drawing more curious viewers to purchase a ticket. Sometimes, carnies will disguise themselves as ordinary attendees in order to be abducted by a \"ghost\" or \"monster\" in front of others, presenting the illusion of danger.": "{@b Haunted House} - 一个以 \"闹鬼 \"为主题的游乐场，其中有各种装置或化装演员试图吓唬或惊吓那些经过的人。虽然仍然是完全封闭的，但 \"闹鬼 \"的游乐场会有许多黑暗的窗户或较薄的墙壁，以便让惊恐的观众的尖叫声向外回响，吸引更多好奇的观众来买票。有时，笑匠会把自己伪装成普通观众，以便在别人面前被 \"鬼 \"或 \"怪物 \"绑架，呈现出危险的幻觉。",
	"{@b Barrel Roll} - A tunnel section of the funhouse is in fact a large barrel on its side, which is spun by workers on the outside. Guests attempting to traverse the hall must try to walk at an angle in order to not be sent tumbling.": "{@b Barrel Roll} - 游乐场的一个隧道部分实际上是一个侧面的大木桶，由外面的工人旋转着。试图穿越大厅的客人必须尽量以一定的角度行走，以避免被送入翻滚中。",
	"Maintaining funhouses can be a never-ending \"arms race\" between different carnival groups, or between neighboring towns with competing festivals, to try to provide the most fun experience. Let your creativity run wild and come up with different funhouse activities and attractions that work with your own settings and themes.": "维护游乐场可能是不同的狂欢节团体之间，或相邻城镇之间相互竞争的节日之间永无休止的 \"军备竞赛\"，以试图提供最有趣的体验。让你的创造力发挥到极致，想出不同的游乐场活动和景点，配合你自己的设置和主题。",
	"Though often too difficult to set up on demand, a log flume ride can be a charming part of an agricultural fair. Many lumber mills construct \"flumes\", long troughs that carry flowing water downhill, in order to transport cut logs for further processing. Depending on how far a log must be carried, a log flume may follow a very scenic route, or even be elevated by trestle over gorges and down steep hills.": "虽然通常很难按要求设置，但乘坐原木水槽可以成为农业博览会的一个迷人的部分。许多木材厂建造了 \"水槽\"，即长长的水槽，将流水带下山，以便运输切割好的原木进行进一步加工。根据原木必须被运多远，原木水槽可能会沿着一条风景优美的路线，甚至通过栈桥跨越峡谷和走下陡峭的山丘而升高。",
	"During a fair, the lumber mill will often be shut down to allow workers time off to celebrate and relax. However, the natural water flow of the log flume never stops, so enterprising entertainers will replace the logs with small boats, or even hollowed out logs, and offer log rides to visitors.": "在集市期间，木材厂往往会关闭，让工人们有时间庆祝和放松。然而，原木水槽的自然水流从未停止过，所以有进取心的艺人会用小船，甚至是挖空的原木来代替原木，并向游客提供原木游乐设施。",
	"The spirit of competition calls to many. Whether their eyes are on the prizes, or simply the glory of victory, there are often no shortages of people queueing to enter competitions and contests at carnivals.

	"If we were to follow the rules of modern archery competitions, we'd be running a very boring sort of contest. Each competitor would be given several dozen arrows to fire at a target, at increasingly shorter distances, for several rounds. This turns into somewhere between roughly 100 and 150 dice-rolls per competitor, if scored accurately. So instead of playing \"the long game\", our archery competitions endeavor to make a shorter contest more exciting.": "如果我们遵循现代射箭比赛的规则，我们将进行一种非常无聊的比赛。每位参赛者将得到几十支箭，以越来越短的距离射向一个目标，进行几轮比赛。如果准确计分的话，这就变成了每个参赛者大约100到150次掷骰子。因此，我们的射箭比赛不是玩 \"长游戏\"，而是努力使较短的比赛更加精彩。",
	"We're going to limit our formal options to shortbow, excluding heavy crossbows and the longbow from competition. By building our competition around a weapon with an effective range of 80 feet and a maximum range of 320, it keeps the playing field significantly smaller and easier to manage. This also gives room for hand crossbow and dagger-throwing characters to petition for entry to competitions, should you so desire. They'll be competing at a marked disadvantage, but they'll still have a fighting chance, and nothing feels cooler than beating the odds.": "我们要把正式的选择限制在短弓上，把重弩和长弓排除在竞争之外。通过围绕一种有效射程为80英尺、最大射程为320英尺的武器建立我们的比赛，可以使比赛场地大大缩小，更容易管理。这也为手弩和匕首投掷角色申请参加比赛提供了空间，如果你愿意的话。他们将在竞争中处于明显的劣势，但他们仍然有一个战斗的机会，没有什么比战胜困难的感觉更酷了。",
	"That being said, you're welcome to take the provided rules and modify them to work with longer-ranged weaponry, custom weapons like guns, etc.When most people think of an archery competition, they think of competitors standing in a row, shooting at targets at a fixed location, each trying to land their shot as close to the bullseye as possible. It offers bleachers for commoners to view from, elevated viewing boxes for nobles or royalty, and all of the classic cliches and tropes we're accustomed to.

	"In standard combat, the only ranges that matter for shooting a bow are effective range, and maximum range. However, it's important to remember that in combat, hitting a target with a powerful strike is generally more important than exactly where the target is hit; hitting a particular location is generally the realm of narrative freedom in 5th edition. For most enemies, a matter of an inch or two difference in the location of the hit is inconsequential to the damage being dealt. In target-shooting competition however, an inch or two can determine who's standing on the podium in the end. Thus, the ACs for different rings of the target will vary based on the distance from the target. ": "在标准战斗中，对弓箭射击来说，唯一重要的范围是有效范围和最大范围。然而，重要的是要记住，在战斗中，以强大的攻击力击中目标通常比目标被击中的确切位置更重要；在第五版中，击中一个特定的位置通常是叙述的自由领域。对于大多数敌人来说，被击中的位置相差一两英寸对所造成的伤害是无足轻重的。然而在打靶比赛中，一两英寸就能决定谁能站在最后的领奖台上。因此，目标的不同环的AC值将根据与目标的距离而变化。",
	"If one of your players has taken the Sharpshooter feat, they will have several benefits that may help them edge out other shooters. One of these is the opportunity to take a penalty to an attack roll, but if it hits, they can add a large bonus to the attack's damage. Choosing to take a penalty on an attack role in a competition focused on accuracy may be a dangerous risk, but if you have a player who decides to go for it, make sure you reward them for a success! If they strike the target, and make a reasonably high damage roll, let them split or splinter the wooden target. Of course, don't prompt them to do this, or let them know it's an option... This kind of 'rule of cool' reward is best given as a surprise.": "如果你的某个玩家获得了神枪手的特技，他们会有几个好处，可以帮助他们在其他枪手中占优势。其中之一是有机会对攻击卷进行惩罚，但如果击中了，他们可以为攻击的伤害增加一个很大的奖励。在注重准确性的比赛中，选择对攻击角色进行惩罚可能是一个危险的风险，但如果你有一个决定去做的球员，请确保你奖励他们的成功！如果他们击中了目标，并使之成为一个成功的例子，那么他们就会有一个成功的机会。如果他们击中了目标，并且打出了相当高的伤害卷，就让他们把木头目标劈开或劈碎。当然，不要提示他们这样做，也不要让他们知道这是一个选项...... 这种 \"酷规则 \"的奖励最好是作为一个惊喜来给予。",

Gronkna is a half-orc with a CON of 16, meaning her score will be 24. Lunalee is a human with a CON of 10, meaning her score will be 15.": "让我们看看我们的三个喝酒的例子，米拉、格朗克纳和卢娜丽之间的游戏会如何进行。米拉是一个地精，CON值为12，这意味着她的酒精耐受力为12。Gronkna是一个半兽人，CON为16，这意味着她的分数将是24。Lunalee是一个人类，CON值为10，这意味着她的得分将是15。",

Though Mira may become drunk faster than Lunalee because of her size, her increased Constitution (providing a +1) provides her with a better chance of making her saves than Lunalee.": "喝啤酒，每杯酒的酒精含量为3，米拉需要喝四杯啤酒才能进行第一次拯救。当她喝下第五杯时，她将滚动宪法DC 13。如果她再喝，她的DC就变成16。如果她再喝，她的DC就会变成19。如果在任何时候她失败了，她就会昏倒，并被淘汰出局。同样的硬币，Gronkna要喝八杯才能开始进行体质拯救，Lunalee则要喝五杯。虽然米拉因为体型原因可能比卢娜丽醉得更快，但她增加的体质（提供+1）为她提供了比卢娜丽更好的救赎机会。",

	"Food is a part of many holidays and festivals, and eating large amounts of food is considered a primary method of celebration by many. It stands to reason that someone's competitive nature meant an eating contest would be born. Typically, eating contests select a single food item as their focus. Pies are common, as they are made to a uniform size and density. However, any food could be used, ranging from apples, to ears of corn, to giant turkey legs. Judges are always on hand to ensure that the food is fully consumed, and an excess of food is not left behind (pie crust still in the pan, meat left on a bone, etc). Competitors are disqualified if they stand from the table, pass out at the table, or if they throw up. The last competitor still eating, wins. Competitors in a pie eating contest make Constitution saves for each pie they eat, with the DC steadily raising for each pie eaten. If a competitor fails their Constitution save, they are given the \"full\" status. They may continue to compete if they wish, but additional saves will be made with disadvantage. Failing another Constitution save after becoming full, will cause the competitor to vomit (or pass out, if you feel players at your table may be squeamish).": "食物是许多假期和节日的一部分，吃大量的食物被许多人认为是庆祝的主要方法。按理说，有人的竞争天性意味着会有饮食比赛的诞生。通常情况下，饮食比赛选择一种单一的食品作为其重点。馅饼很常见，因为它们的大小和密度都是统一的。然而，任何食物都可以使用，从苹果、玉米穗到巨型火鸡腿。裁判员总是在现场，以确保食物被完全吃完，并且没有留下多余的食物（饼皮还在锅里，肉留在骨头上，等等）。如果参赛者从桌子上站起来，在桌子上晕倒，或者呕吐，就会被取消资格。最后一个仍在吃的参赛者获胜。吃饼比赛的参赛者每吃一个饼都要进行宪法拯救，每吃一个饼，DC就会稳步提高。如果参赛者没有通过体质救赎，他们将被授予 \"完全 \"状态。如果他们愿意，他们可以继续参加比赛，但额外的救赎将以不利的方式进行。饱食之后，如果再一次救赎失败，将导致竞争者呕吐（或昏迷，如果你觉得你的桌子上的玩家可能会胆怯）。",
	"If your competitors somehow make it past round 10, continue to add 5 to the DC for each additional round of eating. Keep in mind, for the sake of roleplay, that these are servings of food and not rounds of combat, therefore, each round need not consist of a mere six seconds.": "如果你的竞争对手以某种方式撑过了第10轮，那么每多吃一轮就继续在DC上加5。请记住，为了角色扮演的需要，这些都是食物的分量，而不是战斗的回合，因此，每个回合不需要仅仅包括6秒钟。",

	"While one may question where the big eater puts their food, a character with sleight of hand may have worked out that detail in a unique way. If a character wants to sneak handfuls of food down their shirt collar, or into a bag hidden under the table, they are welcome to make the attempt. For example, if they make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) that beats a DC 15, they have snuck away enough food to make their Constitution save with advantage for that round. If they beat a DC 20, they manage to sneak away enough food that whatever is left is inconsequential, and they can skip their Constitution save for the round. However, if they fail their Dexterity (Sleight Of Hand) check, they will be noticed by a judge and disqualified.": "虽然人们可能会质疑大胃王把食物放在哪里，但一个有手腕的角色可能已经用独特的方式解决了这个细节。如果一个角色想从他们的衬衫领子里偷偷摸摸地拿出几把食物，或者藏在桌子下面的袋子里，我们欢迎他们进行尝试。例如，如果他们用灵巧的手法（Sleight of Hand）战胜了DC 15，他们就已经偷吃了足够的食物，可以在那一回合以优势进行宪法保护。如果他们战胜了DC20，他们就设法溜走了足够多的食物，剩下的食物就不重要了，他们就可以跳过这一轮的宪法保护。然而，如果他们的灵巧检查失败，他们就会被法官发现并被取消资格。",

	"In typical farm environments, fleeces are washed after being sheared, since hotter water can be used. For competition purposes, the sheep are washed beforehand, to remove plant matter, burrs, dirt, etc. Sheep are selected for uniform size and growth of their fleece, and sorted into several pens. The goal of a sheep-shearing race is for each competitor to shear every sheep in their pen as quickly as possible without causing injury.": "在典型的农场环境中，由于可以使用较热的水，所以在剪毛后要对羊群进行清洗。出于比赛的目的，羊群要事先清洗，以去除植物物质、毛刺、污垢等。挑选羊只时，要看其绒毛的大小和生长情况是否一致，并将其分到几个羊圈。剪羊毛比赛的目的是让每个参赛者在不造成伤害的情况下尽可能快地剪掉自己羊圈里的每只羊。",
	"When running a sheep-shearing race, competitors roll 1d20 per round, adding their Dexterity Bonus or Wisdom (Animal Handling). This number is kept, and added to for each subsequent round.

	"When performed properly, sheep are not injured in the shearing process.

	"Though some farmers keep their pigs in organized pens, some allow them to run freely in cool, boggy areas.

If they're an exact tie, a rolloff can be held to determine a winner, as the contest judges' personal reflection of who they feel had the best technique.": "在进行叫猪比赛时，参赛者轮流而不是同时进行。竞争者每轮滚动1D20，加上他们的魅力奖励或智慧（动物处理）。这个数字会被保留下来，并在接下来的每一轮中被加上，同时也会追踪已经过去了多少轮。在最低回合数内达到80pts的竞争者赢得比赛。如果两个角色在同一回合达到80分，超过80分的最高者仅以秒数获胜。如果他们的成绩完全相同，则可以通过滚球来决定胜负，作为比赛评委的个人反映，他们认为谁的技术最好。",
	"Whether or not you consider magic spells to be legal or illegal in the contest, is up to your discretion. If a spellcaster uses {@spell Speak With Animals}, you may give them advantage on all of their pig calling rolls. For the purpose of the contest, pigs are considered medium creatures (like wild boars), therefore not affected by the Forest Gnome's Speak With Small Beasts racial feature": "在比赛中，你是否认为法术是合法或非法的，由你来决定。如果施法者使用{@spell Speak With Animals}，你可以让他们在所有召唤猪的卷轴上取得优势。在比赛中，猪被认为是中等生物（如野猪），因此不受森林地精的 \"与小兽交谈 \"种族特征的影响。",
	"Many carnival games are, in fact, rigged. They are designed to make it appear easy to win, but use tricks of perspective, distraction, and faulty equipment to tilt the games in favor of the operators rather than the players. Furthermore, many carnies provide examples of the games being played to show how \"easily\" they can be won, at least, with their added benefit of standing in a different location than the players, knowing exactly where to hit, or using different equipment.": "许多狂欢节游戏事实上是被操纵的。它们被设计成看起来很容易赢，但却利用视角、分心和有缺陷的设备等技巧，使游戏向有利于经营者而非玩家的方向倾斜。此外，许多车夫提供游戏的例子，以显示它们是多么 \"容易 \"获胜，至少，他们的额外好处是站在与玩家不同的位置，确切地知道该打哪里，或使用不同的设备。",
	"Carnival games should always have a cost to play. This cost is at your discretion, and may vary based on the clientele of the carnival; nobles may be willing to pay up to 1gp per game to try their hand, whereas a carnival catering to commoners may only be able to get away with 5cp or 1sp per game.": "狂欢节游戏应该总是有成本的。这个费用由你决定，并可能根据嘉年华会的客户群而有所不同；贵族可能愿意为每场游戏支付高达1gp的费用，而为平民服务的嘉年华会可能只能以每场5cp或1sp的价格成交。",
	"It's theorized that the \"sport\" of jumping on the back of an illtempered bull and trying to hold on for as long as possible was originally pioneered by farmhands, borne of a mixture of boredom and drunkenness. The idea inexplicably caught on, but the tendency for riders to be trampled or gored put a damper on the growth of the sport.": "据推测，跳到脾气不好的公牛背上并试图坚持尽可能长的时间的 \"运动 \"最初是由农夫们开创的，是由于无聊和醉酒的混合结果。这个想法莫名其妙地流行起来，但骑手们被践踏或被刺伤的倾向使这项运动的发展受到了阻碍。",
	"Enter, the Figurine of Wondrous Power, in the form of an Iron Bull. Usage of this uncommon magical item summons a docile gorgon (Monster Manual, pg. 171).

	"Unlike many carnival games, the bucking bull is never rigged per say, but instead, the carnies hawking the challenge suggest that the rider must only stay on for a very brief period of time, and that it can't be that hard. In truth, it is actually that hard.": "与许多狂欢节游戏不同的是，斗牛从来没有被操纵过，相反，兜售这一挑战的狂欢者暗示，骑手必须只在很短的时间内停留，而且不可能那么难。事实上，它实际上是很难的。",
	"The goal is to remain on the gorgon for eight rounds, making strength-opposed grapple checks against the bucking monstrosity. For the purposes of this contest, the rule that creatures cannot grapple a creature more than one size larger them no longer applies; they are holding onto the saddle, not the gorgon itself. Therefore, small sized creatures may enter at their own risk.": "我们的目标是在高竿上停留8个回合，对这只降压的怪兽进行力量对抗的抓捕检查。在这场比赛中，生物不能抓取比自己大一号的生物的规则不再适用；他们抓的是马鞍，而不是高脚龙本身。因此，小体型的生物可以参加，但风险自负。",
	"Though prizes may be given for staying on for a certain number of rounds (4, 6, etc), the prize for staying in the saddle for eight rounds is often quite marvelous and will encourage many attempts.": "虽然可以对坚持一定数量的回合（4、6等）给予奖励，但在马鞍上坚持8个回合的奖励往往是相当了不起的，会鼓励人们多次尝试。",

	"However, the Milk Bottle Toss is not designed to be won. A number of factors are set up in order to lean against the player's favor.

This does not mean that the game cannot be won, but it can be especially difficult to win. Accuracy and how hard the ball is thrown are both important factors.": "然而，扔牛奶瓶的游戏并不是为了赢钱而设计的。一些因素的设置是为了对玩家有利。例如，最下面的三个瓶子通常装满了铅，使它们重了几磅。此外，软球也特别软，有时甚至有软木芯。这并不意味着不能赢得比赛，但要赢得比赛会特别困难。准确度和球的投掷力度都是重要因素。",
	"For the purposes of this game, the ball counts as an improvised weapon (thus benefiting from the Tavern Brawler feat), dealing 1d4 damage and having a normal range of 20 ft., and a long range of 60 ft.

	"Though arm-wrestling is a test of one's muscle, the strongman test is a step further in determining who is the strongest in the land.

However, only breaking partially through the stack will still net them a small consolation prize.": "虽然掰手腕是对一个人肌肉的测试，但强人测试在确定谁是土地上最强壮的人方面更进一步。在这个游戏中，玩家要花钱买一个机会，向一叠石板挥动锤子。如果他们能够一锤子打碎所有的石板，他们就会赢得一份绝妙的奖品！但是，只有部分打碎石板，他们就会被淘汰。然而，如果只是部分击破石板堆，他们仍然会得到一个小小的安慰奖。",

	"In general, a holiday is a day determined by law or tradition, commemorating an important historic event. Most businesses close, and any job that is not an essential service (town guards, healers, etc) is reduced or suspended for the day. A holiday may be religiously based, giving devotees the free time to worship or tend to other duties of their faith. Some holidays exist to observe historical events, or remember people of great importance. Holidays may also be purely recreational events, giving people time to relax and celebrate with friends and loved ones.": "一般来说，节日是由法律或传统决定的，纪念一个重要历史事件的日子。大多数企业关闭，任何非基本服务的工作（城镇警卫、医护人员等）在这一天都会减少或暂停。节日可能是基于宗教的，让信徒们有自由的时间去做礼拜或处理他们信仰的其他职责。有些节日是为了纪念历史事件，或纪念具有重要意义的人物。假日也可能是纯粹的娱乐活动，让人们有时间放松，与朋友和亲人一起庆祝。",
	"Many holidays are comprised of more than just the event itself. Traditions become associated with holidays over time, and will reflect decor, food, music, games, gift-giving, and other practices.": "许多节日不仅仅是由活动本身组成的。随着时间的推移，传统会与节日联系在一起，并反映出装饰、食物、音乐、游戏、礼物赠送和其他做法。",
	"The date on the calendar is an important element of designing your holiday, as decor will often be influenced by signs of the season. A harvest festival will likely use autumnal colors, while a spring festival will use bright colors and myriad green shades to represent new life and growth.": "日历上的日期是设计节日的一个重要因素，因为装饰往往会受到季节迹象的影响。一个收获的节日可能会使用秋天的颜色，而一个春天的节日会使用明亮的颜色和无数的绿色色调来代表新的生命和成长。",
	"The climate will also play a distinct factor in how a holiday is celebrated. Holidays during heavily rainy seasons will likely be indoor affairs, focusing on togetherness. Holidays during the hottest weather will often involve ways to keep cool.": "气候也会对节日的庆祝方式起到明显的影响。在多雨的季节里，节日可能是室内活动，注重团聚。在最热的天气里，节日往往会涉及到保持凉爽的方法。",
	"Some holidays are held in remembrance of people or events. When remembering people, these holidays are often composed posthumously, and great figures in history are celebrated after their death. As such, the holiday could be celebrated on the day they died, the day they performed a great feat, or it could be celebrated on their birthday.": "有些节日是为了纪念人或事件而举行的。在纪念人时，这些节日往往是在死后组成的，历史上的伟大人物都是在死后庆祝的。因此，节日可以在他们去世的那一天庆祝，也可以在他们完成伟大壮举的那一天庆祝，还可以在他们的生日庆祝。",
	"Though memorial holidays can be sombre affairs, this does not mean that there can be no levity in the celebration. Very often, a solemn ceremony or religious service will be held early in the day, followed by more joyous celebrations in the afternoon and evening.": "尽管追悼会可能是一个严肃的事务，但这并不意味着庆祝活动中不能有任何轻松的气氛。很多时候，庄严的仪式或宗教仪式将在当天早些时候举行，随后在下午和晚上举行更多欢乐的庆祝活动。",
	"The oppression or ownership of any person is a terrible thing. Worse still is when these acts of oppression or slavery are sanctioned or even enforced by governing powers. Obtaining one's freedom is usually a bloody affair, and requires not only the defeat of slavers, but the overturning of laws and social perceptions that make such oppression possible at its core. An economy built on slave-labor is generally not willing to just give slaves their freedom peacefully, and very often, they've built the mindset that their slaves are \"lesser beings\" that are either undeserving of their freedom, or might be dangerous if freed.": "对任何人的压迫或所有权是一件可怕的事情。更糟糕的是，当这些压迫或奴役行为得到执政者的认可甚至强制执行的时候。获得自由通常是一件血腥的事情，不仅需要打败奴隶主，还需要推翻使这种压迫成为可能的法律和社会观念的核心。一个建立在奴隶劳动基础上的经济体通常不愿意和平地给予奴隶自由，而且往往他们已经建立了这样的心态：他们的奴隶是 \"低等生物\"，要么不值得他们获得自由，要么如果获得自由可能是危险的。",
	"Even a bloodless rebellion will often involve great hardships, such as fleeing over great distances, hiding in dangerous wilderness or climates, and long periods of uncertainty before being able to settle again. Thus, these celebrations can be vitally important for embracing the freedom and peace of mind that one's ancestors were denied.": "即使是不流血的叛乱，也往往会涉及巨大的困难，如远距离逃亡，躲藏在危险的荒野或气候中，以及在能够重新定居之前的漫长的不确定性。因此，这些庆祝活动对于拥抱自己的祖先被剥夺的自由和心灵的平静可能是极其重要的。",
	"Celebrating freedom from slavery and oppression is often a mixture of both solemn memorial, and jubilant celebration. Leaders and resistors who fought for their freedom are remembered, as well as mourning for those who died before seeing their people achieve freedom. It is also a time to revel in one's freedom, and showcase cultural practices that were denied to them while in captivity. Many enslaved peoples are stripped of their cultural practices and rights in an effort to demoralize them. This can mean the outlawing of their dances, songs, arts, and even important ceremonies for marriage or child-naming. Thus, celebrations of freedom from slavery may place importance on these nearly-lost parts of one's culture. Some ceremonies may even take on new facets from the ways that they were practiced in secret, such as \"walking around a large tree and greeting one another on the other side\" becoming an important wedding tradition.": "庆祝摆脱奴隶制和压迫的自由，往往是庄严的纪念和欢快的庆祝。人们缅怀为自由而战的领导人和抵抗者，同时也哀悼那些在看到自己的人民获得自由之前就死去的人。这也是一个为自己的自由而陶醉的时刻，并展示他们在被囚禁期间被剥夺的文化习俗。许多被奴役的人民被剥夺了他们的文化习俗和权利，以努力使他们丧失士气。这可能意味着他们的舞蹈、歌曲、艺术，甚至重要的婚姻或儿童命名仪式被取缔。因此，摆脱奴隶制的庆祝活动可能会重视一个人的文化中这些几乎消失的部分。一些仪式甚至可能从秘密进行的方式中获得新的面貌，例如 \"绕着一棵大树走，在另一边相互问候 \"成为重要的婚礼传统。",
	"When designing a holiday to celebrate freedom from slavery or oppression, remember to think of it from various viewpoints. Why were the formerly-enslaved people singled out (racial or religious differences, defeated in a previous war, etc)? How are the formerly-enslaved peoples treated by their former oppressors? Are formerly-enslaved people still oppressed from an economic standpoint? Do they have true equality, or are they still looked down upon by other groups? Do the former oppressors feel as though they are now the injured or unfairly-treated party in this situation? Also keep in mind that no large group holds all of the same opinions as one another; some descendants of slave-owners may feel remorseful for the actions of their ancestors, while others may prefer to carry on a tradition of hatred.": "在设计一个庆祝摆脱奴隶制或压迫的节日时，记得要从不同的角度来考虑它。为什么以前的被奴役者会被挑出来（种族或宗教差异，在以前的战争中被打败，等等）？以前被奴役的人民是如何被他们以前的压迫者对待的？从经济角度看，以前的被奴役者仍然受到压迫吗？他们是否有真正的平等，还是仍然被其他群体看不起？在这种情况下，以前的压迫者是否觉得他们现在是受害方或受到不公平待遇的一方？还要记住，没有一个大的群体彼此持有所有相同的观点；一些奴隶主的后代可能对他们祖先的行为感到悔恨，而另一些人可能更愿意继承仇恨的传统。",

	"This holiday is a mixture of Easter celebrations, the idiom of the Golden Goose, and a particular Japanese fairytale! It also utilizes the Swanmay, a classic AD&D race of humanoid women who can transform into birds. Though at the time of this publication the Swanmay have not appeared in D&D since 3.5e, some intrepid writers on the DM's Guild have brought the race into the light of 5th edition. Legend has it that a poor and lonely hunter once found an injured swan at the side of a frozen lake, surrounded by wolves. Running off the wolves, the hunter saved the swan, and brought her to his home where he mended her broken wing and took care of her throughout the winter. Once the swan healed, she flew away in the spring. At the start of the next winter, the hunter was visited by a beautiful woman travelling through the woods near his home. The two fell in love and married. Though the hunter and his bride were happy together, they were very poor. Feeling guilty that he could not provide for his lovely wife, the hunter became depressed. One day, the hunter's wife came out of their chicken coop and handed him a golden egg she'd found, encouraging him to hurry to the nearby town and sell it. The hunter did, and he brought back a sack of money and enough food for them to feast on for days. Time passed, and when the money ran out, the hunter's wife found another golden egg for him to sell. When spring came, the hunter asked his wife which of their chickens was providing golden eggs, but she merely told him not to worry about it, and not to go into the chicken coop when she was tending to the birds. Though the hunter begrudgingly agreed, his curiosity got the better of him one day. When his wife went into the chicken coop, he peered through a crack in the wooden wall. To his shock, he watched his wife transform into a swan, and lay a golden egg. The hunter cried out in surprise, and startled the swan.": "这个节日是复活节庆祝活动、金鹅的成语和一个特殊的日本童话的混合体！它还利用了天鹅美，这个经典的AD&D种族可以变成鸟类。它还利用了Swanmay，一个经典的AD&D种族，即可以变身为鸟类的人形女性。尽管在本书出版时，天鹅绒还没有出现在D&D的3.5e版本中，但DM's Guild的一些无畏的作者已经将这个种族带到了第五版中。传说中，一个贫穷而孤独的猎人曾经在一个冰湖边发现了一只受伤的天鹅，周围都是狼。猎人赶走了狼群，救下了天鹅，并把她带到了自己的家里，在那里他修补了她的断翅，照顾了她整个冬天。一旦天鹅痊愈，她就在春天飞走了。第二年冬天开始时，一位在他家附近的森林里旅行的美丽女子拜访了猎人。两人相爱并结婚。虽然猎人和他的新娘在一起很幸福，但他们却非常贫穷。猎人为自己不能养活可爱的妻子而感到内疚，变得很沮丧。有一天，猎人的妻子从他们的鸡舍里出来，递给他一个她发现的金蛋，鼓励他赶紧去附近的镇上卖掉它。猎人照做了，他带回了一袋钱和足够他们吃上好几天的食物。时间一天天过去，钱用完了，猎人的妻子又找到一个金蛋让他去卖。当春天来临的时候，猎人问他的妻子是哪只鸡在提供金蛋，但她只是告诉他不要担心，当她照看小鸡的时候不要进入鸡舍。虽然猎人勉强同意了，但有一天他的好奇心还是得到了满足。当他的妻子进入鸡舍时，他从木墙的缝隙中窥视。令他震惊的是，他看到妻子变成了一只天鹅，并下了一个金蛋。猎人惊讶地叫了起来，吓了天鹅一跳。",
	"The hunter's wife emerged from the chicken coop, sobbing. She admitted to him that she was the swan he had saved the previous winter, and was Princess of the Swanmay. But, now that he knew her secret, she could no longer stay with him. Though her husband tearfully begged for forgiveness, the heartbroken princess turned back into a swan and flew away. Though the tale of love lost and trust broken is an important fable, many folk latch onto more superficial aspects of the story. Every spring, celebrants of the Day Of The Golden Swan go into woods to search for golden (or jeweled) eggs left by theoretical Swanmay royalty. As the story (and possibility of finding treasure) is so enthralling to young children, the holiday is built around entertaining them. Fresh eggs are carefully emptied by poking a small hole in both ends and blowing out the contents. The emptied shells are then decorated in any number of ways. Many households dye them by boiling them with vegetables or berries, and some paint designs on them, or paste pieces of paper to the outside. Adults will hide decorated eggs in the woods near their homes, and then send children out (under watchful supervision) to try to find the hidden eggs. Because the empty egg shells are quite fragile, children are encouraged not to be rambunctious in their hunt. Small prizes or treats are often awarded to the children who find the most (intact) eggs, or who find eggs that were especially cleverly hidden.": "猎人的妻子从鸡笼里走出来，泣不成声。她向他承认，她就是他前年冬天救下的那只天鹅，是天鹅梅的公主。但是，现在他知道了她的秘密，她不能再和他在一起了。尽管她的丈夫含泪乞求原谅，这位伤心的公主还是变回了天鹅，飞走了。尽管这个关于失去爱情和信任的故事是一个重要的寓言，但许多民间人士却抓住了故事中更多肤浅的方面。每年春天，金天鹅节的庆祝者都会到树林里寻找理论上天鹅美皇室成员留下的金蛋（或珠宝蛋）。由于这个故事（以及找到宝藏的可能性）对年幼的孩子来说是如此吸引人，这个节日是围绕着娱乐他们而建立的。新鲜的鸡蛋被小心翼翼地掏出来，在两端戳一个小洞，然后把里面的东西吹出来。清空后的蛋壳可以用任何方式进行装饰。许多家庭用蔬菜或浆果煮鸡蛋来染色，有些家庭在鸡蛋上画图案，或在外面贴上纸片。大人们会把装饰好的鸡蛋藏在他们家附近的树林里，然后让孩子们出去（在有人监督的情况下），试图找到隐藏的鸡蛋。由于空蛋壳相当脆弱，因此鼓励孩子们在寻找过程中不要太过狂躁。找到最多（完整的）鸡蛋的孩子，或者找到隐藏得特别巧妙的鸡蛋的孩子，通常会得到小奖品或点心。",
	"Most commonly available dyes adhere poorly egg shells, so many eggs are pastel. Thus, pastel colors like powder pink, baby blue, mint, lavender, and periwinkle are commonly associated with the holiday, but brighter colors may also be painted directly on the eggs": "大多数常见的染料在蛋壳上附着力很差，所以许多鸡蛋都是粉色的。因此，粉红色、婴儿蓝、薄荷色、薰衣草色和长春花色等柔和的颜色通常与这个节日有关，但更鲜艳的颜色也可以直接画在鸡蛋上。",

	"This holiday works best in rural areas where cattle are an important staple, though you could modify it to focus on any animal that might be driven out to summer pastures. Many aspects of the festival also lend themselves well to fae involvement.

It is based on the pagan holiday of Beltane, practiced in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle Of Man.": "这个节日在以牛为重要主食的农村地区效果最好，不过你也可以修改一下，把重点放在任何可能被赶到夏季牧场的动物上。这个节日的许多方面也很适合异族参与。这个节日通常在西方日历的5月1日举行，或者大致在春分和夏至之间。它基于异教节日Beltane，在爱尔兰、苏格兰和马恩岛实行。",
	"At the start of summer, cattle owners will drive their cattle to new pastures. This is often a major undertaking, and in order to protect their herd from illness and misfortune, they will reach out to nearby druid circles to ask for blessings. Understanding the destructive, but also renewing properties of fire, a druid circle pioneered this night-time festival to cleanse a farm house of ill omens and start the summer season fresh. Over time, the festival grew beyond just farmers and their cattle, and now entire towns take part in the celebration.": "在夏季开始时，牛主人会把他们的牛赶到新的牧场。这通常是一项重要的工作，为了保护他们的牛群不受疾病和不幸的影响，他们会向附近的德鲁伊圈子求助，请求保佑。由于了解火的破坏性，但也有更新的特性，一个德鲁伊圈子率先在夜间举行这个节日，以清洗农舍的不祥之兆，并开始新的夏季。随着时间的推移，这个节日逐渐超越了农民和他们的牛，现在整个城镇都参加了这个庆祝活动。",

	"Though fae are mysterious creatures and little is known about them by most common folk, superstitions run rampant. One such superstition is that fairies are especially active around the start of summer. Thus, locals will also make visits to locations where fairies are known or suspected to inhabit, to make offerings like milk, berries, flowers, and naturebased treasures like sea shells, uncut jewels, and wooden beads. Because fairies are known for their mischievousness, townsfolk and farmers hope to appease (or at least distract) the fairies during their bonfire rituals.": "虽然异族是神秘的生物，大多数普通人对他们知之甚少，但迷信却很猖獗。其中一个迷信是，仙女在夏天开始的时候特别活跃。因此，当地人也会到已知或怀疑有仙女居住的地方去，献上牛奶、浆果、鲜花以及海贝、未切割的珠宝和木珠等基于自然的宝物。由于仙女以其顽皮著称，乡民和农民希望在篝火仪式上安抚（或至少分散）仙女的注意力。",
	"At sun down, every household fire in the town is put out. Even blacksmiths may be willing to put their work on hold to baffle down their forges.

	"While every town practices it differently, common celebrations include drinking, dancing, sacrificing animals, and/or cooking communal meals on smaller bonfires lit from the two large fires. Jumping over fire pits is also a common activity, practiced by young men or women to show their bravery, or by lovers to show their devotion to one another (\"leaping through fire to be together\"). Once the festivities have ended, every member of the town takes a torch and lights it at one of the two giant bonfires of the festival. This flame is then used to re-light the fires in their homes, warming their hearths with a fresh and pure light. The next day, the ashes from the bonfire are collected and scattered on crops.": "虽然每个城镇的做法不同，但常见的庆祝活动包括饮酒、跳舞、祭祀动物和/或在两个大火点燃的小篝火上做公共餐。跳过火坑也是一项常见的活动，由年轻男子或妇女进行，以显示他们的勇敢，或由恋人进行，以显示他们对彼此的奉献（\"跳过火坑，在一起\"）。庆典结束后，镇上的每个人都拿着火把，在节日的两个巨大篝火中的一个点燃。然后，这束火焰被用来重新点燃他们家中的火，用新鲜和纯净的光线温暖他们的炉灶。第二天，篝火的灰烬被收集起来，撒在农作物上。",
	"Yellow flowers are the primary decor of the Bonfire Bash, but yellow clothing is also very popular among those with the complexion to pull it off.

	"The crux of this festival is location and season. The ideal locale is a village or town located at the base of a mountain. By keeping the settlement small, it reduces the wealth and access to magical options, meaning the locals have to resort to more mundane means of keeping cool.

For three days straight, the groups of four to eight young men and women depart in the morning, carrying empty chests on litters. The groups travel for days up to a specially built \"pantry\" high up in the side of the mountain to retrieve large blocks of ice, packing them into their lined chests, before descending the mountain again.": "并非每个节日都是以童话或迷信开始的。有时，一个节日的形成纯粹是出于对季节的观察，或对世俗变化的反应。夏风节没有得到广泛庆祝，但它是一些村庄在夏日里的一项重要社区活动。为了抵御炎热的夏季，这个小农镇在夏风节前一周就开始准备，把一批批农夫送到附近的山上。连续三天，这些由四至八名青年男女组成的小组在早晨出发，用轿子抬着空箱子。这群人连续几天到山边高处专门建造的 \"储藏室 \"去取大块的冰，把它们装进有衬里的箱子，然后再下山。",
	"For the three days of the festival itself, the groups arrive to great fanfare, bringing half-melted ice blocks to the grateful residents. The remaining ice is shaved by workers and served in bowls, drizzled with sweet syrups made from locally grown fruits. Though the ice doesn't last long, and the hot weather will continue for weeks to come, the festival is a welcome break for laborers at the hottest point in the summer.": "在节日的三天里，这些团体大张旗鼓地来到这里，把半融化的冰块带给感激的居民。剩下的冰块由工人刨开，装在碗里，淋上用当地种植的水果制成的甜味糖浆。尽管冰块不会持续很久，而且炎热的天气将持续数周，但在夏季最热的时候，这个节日对劳动者来说是一个受欢迎的休息。",
	"Streamers made of strips of cloth are hung from the eaves of buildings, sometimes tied to bells or chimes, in order to flutter and chime whenever a breeze blows through. In poorer homes, these cloth strips are made of whatever can be repurposed, such as clothing that has been damaged and recycled into rags. In wealthier homes, strips of white and blue linen or silk are preferred.": "由布条制成的彩旗被挂在建筑物的屋檐下，有时绑在铃铛或风铃上，以便每当有微风吹过时，彩旗就会飘动并发出响声。在较贫穷的家庭，这些布条是用任何可以重新利用的东西制成的，例如被损坏的衣服，回收成破布。在较富裕的家庭，首选白色和蓝色亚麻布或丝绸的布条。",
	"While shaved ice is the most classic staple of the festival, a variety of fresh fruits are also consumed, usually having been lightly chilled in a nearby river immediately before sale.": "虽然刨冰是节日中最经典的主食，但各种新鲜水果也被消费，通常在销售前会在附近的河流中轻度冰冻。",
	"The influences on this holiday may be as obvious as they are numerous, drawing inspiration from Halloween, Samhain, Dia de Muertos, Bon Odori, and many others. Depending on the mythos related to death and the afterlife in your particular setting, you may have to fiddle with some of the details, but the door is wide open for the potential of having actual ghostly involvement in the holiday.": "这个节日的影响可能是显而易见的，因为它从万圣节、Samhain、Dia de Muertos、Bon Odori和其他许多地方汲取了灵感。根据你的特定环境中与死亡和来世有关的神话，你可能不得不对一些细节进行调整，但大门是敞开的，可能会有真正的鬼魂参与到这个节日中。",
	"Legend has it that long ago, two men fought each other in a joust, for the affections of the woman they loved. One of the men died when he was thrown from his injured horse and broke his neck, and the winner went on to marry the lady they had both adored. Many years later, the now retired jouster was walking home late at night when he saw a rider on horseback on a hill. The rider was silhouetted before the moon, but he could see that the rider's own head was but the skull of a horse, and his eyes glowed like candles.": "传说在很久以前，有两个人为了争夺他们所爱的女人的感情，在一场比武中互相争斗。其中一个人被从受伤的马背上摔下来摔断了脖子而死，而胜利者则娶了他们共同爱慕的女士。许多年后，这位已经退休的骑手在深夜回家的路上，看到一个骑手骑在山上。骑手在月亮前的剪影，但他可以看到骑手自己的头只是一个马的头骨，他的眼睛像蜡烛一样发光。",
	"Terrified, the man realized he was being haunted by the opponent he had jousted with many years earlier, and he ran home to his wife. Finding his wife at her dressing table, the husband tried to explain in a panic that she needed to hide him. Not knowing what else to do, the woman took one of her dresses and threw it on her husband, before hiding his head with one of her veils. Moments later, the doors burst open with a terrifying screech of a nightmare horse. Husband and wife alike both screamed and cowered. However, not recognizing his rival in disguise, the undead rider left to continue his search elsewhere. They say that every year, even centuries after his rival has died, the undead rider returns to the world of the living in search of revenge. Each time the undead rider crosses over into the world of the living, he brings with him many souls who long to see loved ones they miss, or who crave resolution to unfinished business. Even if these ghosts mean no ill will, their mere presence is a danger to mortals, so living mortals have started a tradition of disguising themselves on the night of Soultide so that those seeking them can't find them.": "这名男子吓坏了，意识到他被多年前与他比武的对手缠住了，于是他跑回家找他的妻子。发现他的妻子在她的梳妆台前，丈夫惊慌地试图解释她需要隐藏他。由于不知道还能做什么，这个女人拿起她的一件衣服扔到她丈夫身上，然后用她的一件面纱遮住他的头。几分钟后，大门突然打开，发出噩梦般的可怕尖叫声。丈夫和妻子都尖叫起来，畏缩不前。然而，由于没有认出他伪装的对手，这个不死的骑手离开了，继续在其他地方寻找。他们说，每年，甚至在他的对手死后的几个世纪，不死骑士都会回到活人的世界，寻找复仇的机会。每次亡灵骑士穿越到活人世界，他都会带来许多灵魂，他们渴望看到他们所想念的亲人，或者渴望解决未完成的事情。即使这些鬼魂没有恶意，他们的存在对凡人来说也是一种危险，所以活着的凡人已经开始了一个传统，即在Soultide之夜伪装自己，以便那些寻找他们的人无法找到他们。",
	"As the sun goes down on Soultide, anyone brave enough to go outside does so wearing a costume. Originally, crossdressing was the norm, but more creative costumes have come into popularity, such as mummers, adventurers, a variety of masks, or even dressing as ghosts themselves. Nobles began to throw costume parties where they'd gather with friends to eat, have drinks, and tell horror stories; this tradition would eventually make its way to common households as well.": "当太阳在Soultide下山时，任何有胆量到外面去的人都会穿上服装。最初，变装是常态，但更有创意的服装已经开始流行，例如莫默尔人、冒险家、各种面具，甚至自己装扮成鬼。贵族们开始举办化装舞会，他们会和朋友们聚在一起吃饭、喝酒、讲恐怖故事；这一传统最终也会进入普通家庭。",
	"The safety of costumes and the likelihood for many houses to be empty at night, gave way to the tradition of children playing tricks on adults, ranging from minor vandalism to boobytrapped doors and gates. Children began knocking on doors to make certain a home owner was not present before pulling their prank, and if any adult were to answer, the disguised children would demand a small ransom, otherwise they'd pull a trick on the household. Feigning a great fright, many adults acquiesced to the demand, and would give children small pastries, treats, or a few copper coins. This tradition became known as \"trick or treat\".": "服装的安全性和许多房子在晚上可能是空的，这让儿童对成年人进行恶作剧的传统成为可能，从轻微的破坏行为到诱杀门和门的陷阱。孩子们开始敲门，以确定屋主不在，然后再进行恶作剧，如果有成人应答，伪装的孩子们就会索要小额赎金，否则他们就会对这家人进行恶作剧。许多成年人假装非常害怕，默许了这个要求，并会给孩子们小糕点、点心或几个铜币。这一传统被称为 \"不给钱就捣蛋\"。",
	"At midnight, celebrants travel to the nearest body of water (a river, lake, pond, etc), bringing candles and small wooden boats with paper coverings. Removing their masks and disguises by the edge of the water, they light the candles and set the paper lanterns afloat on the water. This act is intended to provide the wandering ghosts of their loved ones with a light to lead them home to the realm of the dead, lest they be trapped in the mortal world for the rest of the year.": "午夜时分，庆祝者前往最近的水体（河流、湖泊、池塘等），带上蜡烛和带纸罩的小木船。在水边摘下面具和伪装，他们点燃蜡烛，将纸灯笼漂浮在水面上。这一行为是为了给他们所爱的人的游魂提供一盏灯，引导他们回家，回到亡灵的领域，以免他们在一年的剩余时间里被困在凡间。",
	"Traditional decorative colors of Soultide include orange, black, purple, and vivid pink. A number of decorative traditions have spawned surrounding Soultide, but they may vary between locales. Recalling the tale of the undead rider who's head was a horse's skull, some houses decorate their doorways or their fireplace mantles with fake humanoid skulls, believing the undead rider will be driven away in jealousy. These skulls, often made of clay or wood, are sometimes painted or decorated with ribbons and flowers to lighten the macabre aesthetic. In households that cannot afford such frivolous decor, it is common for pumpkins or other gourds to be carved with faces, and used in place of skulls.": "Soultide的传统装饰颜色包括橙色、黑色、紫色和鲜艳的粉红色。围绕着Soultide产生了一些装饰传统，但它们在不同的地方可能有所不同。回顾不死骑士的故事，他的头是一个马的头骨，一些房子用假的人形头骨装饰他们的门口或壁炉罩，相信不死骑士会因为嫉妒而被赶走。这些头骨通常由粘土或木头制成，有时被涂上油漆或用丝带和鲜花装饰，以减轻可怕的美感。在买不起这种轻浮装饰的家庭中，常见的是在南瓜或其他葫芦上刻上脸，用来代替头骨。",
	"Though there is not a particular type of food that is traditionally served for Soultide dinner, many households prepare a variety of small treats that can be handed out to ward off mischievous children. This can be as simple as apples or pears, but some households bake small pastries or hand out bags of roasted nuts and seeds.": "虽然在传统上没有一种特定的食物被用于灵魂节晚餐，但许多家庭准备了各种小点心，可以分发出去，以抵御调皮的孩子。这可以是简单的苹果或梨，但有些家庭会烘烤小糕点或分发烤坚果和种子的袋子。",
	"A village of half-orcs live in a mountainous region. They tell tales that long ago, a village of humans had settled at the base of their mountain, but they were being preyed upon by bandits and thieves. As the harvest season was coming to an end, the human village feared that they would not have enough supplies to make it through the winter. Little did they know, a tribe of orcs in the mountains above were suffering an equally lean hunting season.": "一个半兽人的村庄生活在一个山区。他们讲述了这样一个故事：很久以前，一个人类村落在他们的山脚下定居，但他们被强盗和小偷所掠夺。由于收获季节即将结束，这个人类村庄担心他们没有足够的物资来度过冬天。他们不知道，山上的兽人部落正遭受着同样不景气的狩猎季节。",
	"One day, the orcs mounted a raid on the human village, not knowing that they were already besieged by a band of thieves. The orcs frightened the thieves, allowing the villagers to fight back and run the band out of town. The orcs were impressed by the uncharacteristic bravery of the human farmers, and when the humans offered what was left of their harvest to the orcs out of gratitude (or perhaps begging them not to slaughter them too), the orcs were surprised to see how many crops the humans had cultivated in the rocky terrain. Though orcs generally believed other races to be beneath them, the tribe also knew that they were unlikely to survive the coming winter in their current state.": "有一天，兽人袭击了人类的村庄，却不知道他们已经被一伙盗贼围困了。兽人惊吓了盗贼，使村民们得以反击，并将盗贼团赶出了小镇。兽人对人类农民一反常态的勇敢印象深刻，当人类出于感激将他们剩下的收获献给兽人时（也许是求他们不要把他们也宰了），兽人惊讶地看到人类在岩石地带种植了这么多作物。虽然兽人普遍认为其他种族的地位在他们之下，但部落也知道，以他们目前的状态，不太可能在即将到来的冬天生存。",
	"The orcish tribal leader, and the mayor of the small farming town, struck a temporary agreement to share in their resources for the winter. In addition, humans taught orcs their methods of raising livestock and growing crops in the rocky terrain, and orcs in turn taught humans new hunting techniques. By the time spring came, the two groups had formed a tightly knit joint-community.The modern half-orc village still has a few venerable old human men and women who remember what it was like to have orcish neighbors when they were small children, but since orcs seldom live past the age of 45, the orcish traditions are upheld entirely by their half-orc descendants. Every year at the end of the harvest season, they hold a communal feast in the town hall, celebrating the gathering of people together what the locals call, somewhat unimaginatively, Gathering Day.": "兽人部落的首领和小农镇的镇长达成了一项临时协议，分享他们的资源过冬。此外，人类向兽人传授了他们在岩石地带饲养牲畜和种植农作物的方法，而兽人则向人类传授了新的狩猎技术。现代的半兽人村庄仍有一些可敬的人类老人，他们还记得小时候有兽人邻居的感觉，但由于兽人很少活过45岁，兽人的传统完全由他们的半兽人后代来维护。每年收获季节结束时，他们都会在市政厅举行公共宴会，庆祝人们聚集在一起，当地人称之为 \"聚会日\"，有点匪夷所思。",
	"The day is celebrated with farming contests to see who's cultivated the largest produce or raised the best livestock, as well as archery contests and hunting competitions. Shortly before dinner a customary \"bandit attack\" is carried out by some of the village's teenagers and young adults, who are run off by \"the bravest\" children of the village. In their community, the transition from a child who runs off the bandits, to playing one of the bandits, is considered a marker of when a boy or girl becomes a young man or woman, and coincides with additional privileges and responsibilities they'll take on in the coming seasons.": "这一天的庆祝活动包括农事比赛，看谁种植的农产品最大或饲养的牲畜最好，以及射箭比赛和打猎比赛。晚饭前不久，村里的一些青少年和年轻人按惯例进行 \"土匪袭击\"，由村里 \"最勇敢的 \"孩子把他们赶走。在他们的社区里，从跑掉土匪的孩子到扮演土匪之一，被认为是一个男孩或女孩成为年轻男人或女人的标志，并与他们在未来的季节里将承担的额外特权和责任相吻合。",
	"Though decor is not considered of chief importance to the holiday, it's not uncommon for baskets or crates of produce to be put on display, or for dried meats to be hung up like garlands, evoking a sense of plentifulness.": "虽然装饰并不被认为是节日的主要重点，但把一篮子或一箱子的农产品摆出来，或把干肉像花环一样挂起来，唤起人们对丰收的感觉，也是很常见的。",
	"Though much of the food from the harvest will be treated and preserved to last through the winter, the communal feast attempts to serve a wide variety of dishes. Every household provides some part, and many hold an informal competition to bring the best pies, pickles, roasted vegetables, and roasted meats at the feast.": "虽然大部分收获的食物会被处理和保存，以持续到冬季，但公共宴会试图提供各种各样的菜肴。每家每户都提供一些部分，许多家庭举行非正式的比赛，以便在宴会上带来最好的馅饼、腌制食品、烤蔬菜和烤肉。",
	"At first glance, many westerners will recognize this holiday as being analogous to Christmas, but in truth, it's actually patterned after Yuletide. Though the Feast Of The Wild Hunt not associated with any specific religious figures in this iteration, you're welcome to make modifications to bring it closer to the base of Christmas or Yuletide if you prefer. If you're using a calendar that is analogous to the western calendar, the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will begin on the 20th day of the 12th month, and end on the 31st, meaning it will coincide with any potential New Year's Eve celebrations. An \"either-or\" approach is recommended, as stacking holidays or placing a New Year's Day holiday immediately after this 12day feast will be excessive and/or exhausting.": "乍一看，许多西方人会认为这个节日类似于圣诞节，但事实上，它实际上是以圣诞为模式。虽然在这个版本中，野猎节与任何特定的宗教人物都没有关系，但如果你愿意，欢迎你进行修改，使其更接近于圣诞节或元宵节的基础。如果你使用的日历与西历相似，狂猎节将在12月20日开始，31日结束，这意味着它将与任何可能的除夕庆祝活动相吻合。建议采用 \"非此即彼 \"的方法，因为在这12天的盛宴之后立即叠加假期或安排元旦假期将是过度和/或疲惫的。",
	"This twelve-day festival begins on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and celebrates the tradition that a party of ghostly (or perhaps divine) hunters rides through the woods in search of great prey during this season. It is believed that this \"wild hunt\" also sweeps up all of the remnants of dead souls of the year and brings them along as servants on the hunt, ending times of mourning. The wild hunt serves an important purpose, bringing a close to the end of the year and starting anew.": "这个为期12天的节日始于冬至，即一年中最短的一天，并庆祝这样一个传统：在这个季节，一队幽灵般的（或许是神圣的）猎人骑马穿过森林，寻找伟大的猎物。人们相信，这个 \"野猎 \"也会扫除一年中所有死去的灵魂的残余，并把它们作为猎物的仆人带在身边，结束哀悼的时间。野外狩猎有一个重要的目的，为一年的结束和新的开始画上句号。",
	"It is customary that no work is done during the twelve day festival; while this does not mean that every business closes (healers, inns, and general stores often stay open in at least a limited capacity), people hurry to get many jobs finished before the festival, such as cutting wood, works of crafting, sewing, etc. Some believe that disaster awaits those who have not completed their work before the festival, and they may even be swept up along with the dead souls and taken by the wild hunt. The Feast Of The Wild Hunt makes for a busy travelling season, as celebrants will often try to return to their family home to celebrate. Though arriving by sunset on the first day of the festival is ideal, work obligations and heavily snowed-in roads make this a difficult proposition for many. As such, visitors tend to trickle in during all twelve days of the feast. Some households who don't have extended family or aren't expecting guests will open their doors to travellers during the season, providing shelter for those who haven't yet completed their journeys. Though all twelve days are considered part of the holiday, four days in particular have noteworthy customs.": "按照惯例，在十二天的节日里不做任何工作；虽然这并不意味着每家企业都关门（医士、旅馆和普通商店往往至少在有限的范围内保持营业），但人们赶在节日前完成许多工作，如砍柴、手工制作、缝纫等。有些人认为，灾难正等待着那些在节日前没有完成工作的人，他们甚至可能与死去的灵魂一起被卷走，被野猎带走。荒野狩猎节是一个繁忙的旅行季节，因为庆祝者往往会设法回到他们的家来庆祝。虽然在节日的第一天日落前到达是最理想的，但工作的义务和严重积雪的道路使许多人难以做到这一点。因此，游客往往会在节日的所有12天内陆续到来。一些没有大家庭或不期待客人的家庭会在这个季节向旅行者敞开大门，为那些尚未完成旅行的人提供住所。虽然所有12天都被认为是节日的一部分，但有四天特别有值得注意的习俗。",
	"The wild hunt begins, and everyone completes their work by sunset, with no intent to resume until the festival has ended. On this day, it is customary for households to gift their friends and loved ones with logs for their hearths, to keep them burning for all twelve days of the festival. Very large and dry logs are prized gifts, and may be kept and prepared for months before the Feast Of The Wild Hunt. Many people will also keep bundles of small dry sticks and twigs tied with cord (often gathered by the household's children) to give as gifts to acquaintances. Roadside vendors will sell bundles of split firewood decorated with ribbons, holly, mistletoe, and pine needles to be purchased for gifting when travellers return home as guests. This is considered a time for welcoming guests, and households will often bake fresh bread or keep pots of spiced cider over their fires, letting the welcoming scents of the season waft out to draw their travellers home.": "野外狩猎开始了，每个人都在日落前完成他们的工作，在节日结束前没有人打算继续工作。在这一天，家家户户都习惯于给朋友和亲人的壁炉送上原木，让他们在节日的所有12天里一直燃烧。非常大和干燥的原木是珍贵的礼物，可以在野猎节前保存和准备几个月。许多人还会保留一捆用绳索捆绑的小干树枝和树枝（通常是由家庭的孩子收集），作为礼物送给熟人。路边的小贩会出售一捆捆用丝带、冬青、槲寄生和松针装饰的劈开的木柴，当旅行者作为客人回家时，可以买来送人。这被认为是一个欢迎客人的时刻，家庭往往会烘烤新鲜的面包或在火堆上放上一壶香料苹果酒，让这个季节的欢迎气味飘散出来，吸引他们的旅客回家。",
	"The last night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt, and on this night, the wild hunt takes with them the dead old year itself, allowing a new year to be ushered in. The last of the food and drink from the feasting is to be finished off, and it's considered bad luck to leave any leftovers. Any oaths made on this night are considered of the utmost importance, and for this reason, many people will propose marriage during this last night of celebration. Many oaths of love, friendship, brotherhood and sisterhood, devotion, or protection are made on the last night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt, and everyone endeavours to enter into the new year with a clean conscience and a bright outlook on the future.": "狂猎节的最后一晚，在这个夜晚，狂猎带着死去的旧年本身，让新的一年迎来了。宴席上最后的食物和饮料都要吃完，留下任何残羹剩饭都被认为是坏运气。在这个夜晚作出的任何誓言都被认为是最重要的，为此，许多人将在这最后一个庆祝之夜提出结婚。许多关于爱情、友谊、兄弟姐妹情谊、奉献或保护的誓言都是在狂欢节的最后一夜作出的，每个人都努力以干净的良心和对未来的美好展望进入新的一年。",
	"The twelfth night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt is considered the last night of the year, therefore, functions as New Year's Eve. Locales that celebrate the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will usually not celebrate an additional New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.": "狂猎节的第十二个晚上被认为是一年中的最后一个晚上，因此，作为除夕的功能。庆祝狂猎节的地区通常不会再庆祝除夕或元旦。",
	"Natural plants like oak wood, pine needles and pine cones, holly, and mistletoe are considered emblematic of the season, and snow is a natural occurrence. As such, the traditional colors of the feast are brown, green, red, and white, and many will incorporate these colors into their household linens, clothes, etc. Candles are often made of red or green wax for use during the holiday season": "橡树木、松针和松果、冬青和槲寄生等天然植物被认为是这个季节的象征，而雪也是一种自然现象。因此，宴席的传统颜色是棕色、绿色、红色和白色，许多人会将这些颜色融入他们的家纺、衣服等。蜡烛通常由红色或绿色的蜡制成，在节日期间使用。",
	"Feasting is considered a major part of the holiday. The most traditional foods are wild boar, goose, and goat. Drinking is also considered a popular part of the celebration, and spiced hot cider is a tradition found far and wide. Nearly every household has their own family recipe for spiced cider. This is a time of year when many special treats are made, that would normally be considered too extravagant to serve on a normal basis. Pastries, cakes, pies, and other sweets are common treats of the season.": "宴会被认为是节日的一个主要部分。最传统的食物是野猪肉、鹅肉和山羊。饮酒也被认为是庆祝活动的一个受欢迎的部分，五香热苹果酒是一个广泛存在的传统。几乎每个家庭都有他们自己的五香苹果酒配方。每年的这个时候都会有许多特殊的食物被制作出来，这些食物通常被认为是太奢侈了，无法在正常情况下供应。糕点、蛋糕、馅饼和其他甜食是这个季节常见的食物。",
