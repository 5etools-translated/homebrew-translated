	"As the cloaked swordsman made his way through the bustling market place his eyes flashed green for a moment. He could see the unmistakable aura of arcane magic surrounding the unassuming dwarf pretending to shop for wares. The warrior had found his target. As he drew his runic blade, what had appeared to be a dwarven peasant only mere seconds before had reverted to its true form. As the monstrous devil lunged forward, the hooded swordsman gripped his blade and prepared for battle.": "当这个披着斗篷的剑客穿过熙熙攘攘的市场时，他的眼睛有一瞬间闪过了绿色。他可以看到无误的奥术魔法的光环围绕着那个假装买东西的不起眼的矮人。战士已经找到了他的目标。当他拔出他的符文之刃时，仅仅几秒钟前看起来是个矮人农民的东西已经恢复到了它的真实形态。当这个畸形的魔鬼向前扑去时，戴着头巾的剑客握紧了他的刀，准备战斗。",
	"The assassin watched in shock as the Duke walked the streets below with only one guard by his side. This would be the easiest job the killer for hire had ever worked. As the would-be assassin's blade darted toward the Duke's exposed neck, glee turned to fear as the heavily armored guardian appeared where theDuke had been moments ago. Before the killer could react to what had happened, a blade wreathed in emerald flame had pierced his chest, ending his wretched life of crime.": "刺客震惊地看着公爵在下面的街道上行走，身边只有一个警卫。这将是这位雇佣杀手所做过的最简单的工作。当这个可能的刺客的刀刃向公爵裸露的脖子刺去时，快乐变成了恐惧，全副武装的守护者出现在公爵刚才所在的地方。在杀手对所发生的事情作出反应之前，一把镶有翡翠色火焰的刀子刺穿了他的胸膛，结束了他可恶的犯罪生活。",
	"The halfling knelt before the three hooded figures that stood before her. She had spent nearly two years of her life searching for a member of this secret order, and now she had found three. Consumed by sorrow after the loss of her father at the hands of a wicked sorcerer, the young halfling swore she would do whatever it took to gain the power to exact her revenge. Now that the moment was at hand, she swore fealty to the secretive order, offering up her life in return for power.": "半身人跪在站在她面前的三个蒙面人面前。她花了将近两年的时间寻找这个秘密组织的成员，现在她找到了三个。在她的父亲死于一个邪恶的巫师之手后，这个年轻的半身人被悲伤所吞噬，她发誓要不惜一切代价获得力量来实现她的复仇。现在时机已到，她向这个神秘的组织宣誓效忠，用自己的生命来换取权力。",
	"Known by many names throughout the multiverse, those who are able to wield both sword and spell are collectively known as magi. Rather than dedicate their lives to studying arcane magic or mastery of martial technique, these warriors choose a middle path. Though they may never command the earth-shattering magic of an archmage, or go toe to toe with a true master of the blade, a magus is able to master a unique form of arcane combat only used by the members of their order.": "在整个多元宇宙中有许多名字，那些能够同时挥舞剑和法术的人被统称为魔法师。这些战士没有把他们的生命献给研究奥术魔法或掌握武术技巧，而是选择了一条中间道路。虽然他们可能永远不会像大法师那样指挥惊天动地的魔法，也不会和真正的刀剑大师交手，但魔法师能够掌握一种只有他们的成员才会使用的独特的奥术战斗形式。",
	"Their unique style of magic allows them to channel potent spells through their weapon strikes, sense the presence of arcane magic in the world around them, and blunt the force of even the most powerful spells with their signature Aegis.": "他们独特的魔法风格使他们能够通过他们的武器打击引导强大的法术，感知他们周围世界中奥术的存在，并通过他们标志性的Aegis减弱最强大法术的力量。",
	"The magic of the magi is not something everyone can learn. Over time, these arcane warriors have organized themselves into clandestine societies, content to operate in the shadows. Potential magi are often identified from a young age and are inducted into an order only after they have proven their skill and dedication. While some orders are more secretive than others, nearly every order of magi is thought to be nothing more than legend and myths to most of the common folk.": "魔法师的魔法不是每个人都能学会的。随着时间的推移，这些神秘的战士们将自己组织成秘密的社团，满足于在暗处活动。潜在的魔法师通常在年轻时就被发现，只有在他们证明了自己的技能和奉献精神后才会被纳入一个组织。虽然有些教团比其他教团更神秘，但几乎每一个教团对大多数普通人来说，都被认为只是传说和神话。",
	"As magi rise through the ranks of their secret society, they are expected to infiltrate and form relationships with those who wield power. They often set themselves up as personal advisors, guards, and consorts to influential nobles, powerful archmages, and wealthy merchants. Though magi may form relationships, their primary loyalty is always to their order.": "随着魔法师在其秘密社团中的地位不断提高，他们被期望渗透并与那些掌握权力的人建立关系。他们经常把自己设定为有影响力的贵族、强大的大法师和富有的商人的私人顾问、护卫和妃子。虽然魔法师可以建立关系，但他们的主要忠诚度始终是对他们的秩序。",
	"Those who pursue life as a magus often give up everything in order to be accepted and trained by a master. What motivates your magus? Have you always had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and skill? Was one of your loved ones slain by an evil spellcaster, setting you on a path of revenge? Or, do you simply desire to gain skill with both sword and sorcery?": "那些追求魔法师生活的人往往放弃一切，以便被大师接受和训练。是什么促使你的魔法师？你是否一直对知识和技能有一种难以抑制的渴求？你的一个亲人被一个邪恶的施法者杀害了，使你走上了复仇之路？或者，你只是想获得剑和巫术的技能？",
	"Also, consider why your magus has chosen to pursue a life of adventure. Have you been charged by your order to achieve a specific goal? Do you desire to test your arcane and martial skills against those who only master one discipline? Or, have you been pressed into an adventure out of a sense of duty?": "另外，考虑你的魔法师为什么选择追求冒险的生活。你是否被你的命令要求去实现一个特定的目标？你是否希望与那些只掌握一门学科的人测试你的奥术和武术技能？或者，你是出于责任感而被逼着去冒险？",
	"Lastly, decide where you acquired your training as a magi. Are you an initiate into a secret society of arcane warriors? Or, were you trained in secret by a renegade member of an order of powerful magi who work to control the world?": "最后，决定你在哪里获得了作为一个魔法师的训练。你是一个奥术战士的秘密社团的入门者吗？或者，你是由一个为控制世界而工作的强大魔法师组织的叛徒成员秘密训练的？",

	"As the elderly human watched his apprentice struggle to lift the pebble with his mind, he thought back to his youth, and the years of training it took to unlock his own inner psionic power. After traveling the world he had realized that true enlightenment could only be found within, and he retreated to the cave he now called home. As his years had grown fewer in number, he had taken on the young lad as an apprentice to pass on all he had learned.": "当这位年长的人类看着他的学徒奋力用意念举起小石子时，他回想起自己的青年时代，以及为了释放自己内在的幻觉能力而进行的多年训练。在环游世界之后，他意识到真正的启蒙只能在内心找到，于是他退缩到他现在称之为家的山洞里。随着他的岁数越来越小，他收了一个年轻的小伙子作为学徒，把他所学到的东西传授给他。",
	"Selected at birth due to her psionic potential, the young elf had been molded into the perfect assassin. She held her latest target firmly beneath her, and the baron let out a soft cry as a blade of pure psionic energy pierced his heart. The next morning, the baron's guards would find him dead, though the cause of his untimely demise would forever remain a mystery.": "由于她的幻觉潜能，这个年轻的精灵一出生就被选中，被塑造成完美的刺客。她把最新的目标牢牢地压在身下，当一把纯粹的灵能之刃刺入男爵的心脏时，男爵发出了一声轻呼。第二天早上，男爵的卫兵发现他死了，尽管他过早死亡的原因将永远是个谜。",
	"The young dwarf fled into the forest, consumed with the terror of what he'd done. For as long as he could remember, there was something inside him that he had struggled to keep bottled up. That morning, in a brief moment of weakness, his focus had slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within him. He had awoken in the rubble of his home to find his family buried in the ruins. Deep down, he had always known this power would break free. He would live his life as a hermit in the wild where he couldn't harm anyone else.": "这个年轻的侏儒逃进了森林，被他所做的事情的恐怖所吞噬。从他记事起，他的内心就有一些东西，他一直努力地把它们压在心底。那天早上，在一个短暂的虚弱时刻，他的注意力滑落，一股狂野的幻觉力量从他体内爆发出来。他在他家的废墟中醒来，发现他的家人被埋在废墟中。在内心深处，他一直知道这种力量会被释放出来。他将在野外过着隐士般的生活，在那里他不能伤害任何人。",
	"Whether through years of practice, or a once in a generation innate talent, psions learn to manipulate the world with the wondrous power of their minds. Drawing upon the mystical power within, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells. Relying solely on mastery of their mind, psions can perform feats thought impossible, even by the most erudite wizards and devout clerics. For psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power.": "无论是通过多年的练习，还是一代人的先天天赋，幻术师学会了用他们心灵的奇妙力量来操纵世界。利用内心的神秘力量，他们可以不说话就能交流，移动物体，改变他们的身体，甚至显现出法术。仅仅依靠对心智的掌握，灵媒可以完成被认为不可能的壮举，即使是最博学的巫师和最虔诚的神职人员。对幻术师来说，他们能在没有外部力量的帮助下创造奇迹，这是一个非常值得骄傲的地方。",
	"Due to their potential, psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don't learn to control their power, their strange abilities can cause them to be shunned and hated by those around them. Most psions reveal their power only when necessary, and are hesitant to trust others.": "由于他们的潜力，幻术师经常被普通人误解和害怕。如果他们不学会控制自己的力量，他们奇怪的能力会导致他们被周围的人回避和憎恨。大多数幻术师只有在必要的时候才会暴露他们的力量，并且对信任他人犹豫不决。",
	"If they are lucky, potential psions are discovered by a master and taken away from their home to hone their psionic power in seclusion. No matter their philosophy on life, every psion holds it as their sacred duty to one day take on an apprentice with the psionic gift, and teach them to control their power, passing on everything they themselves have learned.": "如果他们幸运的话，潜在的幻术师会被大师发现，并被带离他们的家，在隐居中磨练他们的幻术能力。无论他们的人生哲学如何，每个幻术师都把有朝一日收下一个具有幻术天赋的学徒作为自己的神圣职责，教他们控制自己的力量，传授他们自己所学的一切。",
	"A psions master and how they are trained has great affect on the nature of their abilities. For some, their gift is honed through years of practice and meditation. Others are trained to use their mystic abilities to morph their bodies into deadly weapons. And for the rare few who are never found by a master or attempt to stifle their power, they risk outbursts of wild psionic energy that can have devastating effects.": "幻术师和他们的训练方式对他们能力的性质有很大影响。对有些人来说，他们的天赋是通过多年的练习和冥想磨练出来的。其他人则被训练成使用他们的神秘能力，将他们的身体变成致命的武器。而对于那些从未被大师发现或试图扼杀其力量的极少数人来说，他们有可能爆发出狂野的幻觉能量，从而产生毁灭性的影响。",
	"When creating your psion, consider how you first discovered your psionic potential. Was it in a moment of pure emotion? Or did you realize your power through peaceful meditation? Did you have a mystical experience that awoke something asleep inside of you? Whatever your experience, the first time a psion realizes the true potential of their mind will have a lasting impact on how they view and wield their power.": "在创造你的灵媒时，考虑你第一次是如何发现你的灵媒潜能的。是在一个纯粹的情绪化的时刻？还是你通过平静的冥想意识到你的力量？你是否有一个神秘的经历，唤醒了你内心沉睡的东西？无论你的经历如何，灵媒第一次意识到他们心灵的真正潜力将对他们如何看待和运用他们的力量产生持久的影响。",
	"Also, consider your psionic master. Did another psion take you under their wing, teaching you to control your wondrous power as their apprentice? Or, did you to learn to wield this mysterious inner power on your own? How do you feel about your psionic gift? Is it a point of great pride? Something that separates you from the commoners? Or, do you view your gift as a curse to be hidden and used in the most dire situations?": "另外，考虑一下你的幻术师。是否有另一位幻术师将你置于他们的羽翼之下，教你作为他们的学徒控制你奇妙的力量？或者，是你自己学会了挥舞这种神秘的内在力量？你对自己的幻觉天赋有什么感觉？它是一个非常值得骄傲的点吗？是将你与普通人区分开来的东西吗？或者，你认为你的天赋是一种诅咒，应该被隐藏起来，在最危险的情况下使用？",
	"You can make a psion quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background hermit|phb} background.

	"The slender elf cleaned her glasses with the corner of her cloak as the dust settled around her. Her benefactor had paid her a large sum to locate this forgotten place, and after weeks of pouring over ancient maps, she had pieced together the location of the temple. Now, she had a decision to make. If she reported the location of the temple to her benefactor, it would be ruthlessly stripped of valuables. But, if she kept the location hidden, she could preserve the long-forgotten knowledge contained within. For a savant, knowledge is more precious than any sum of gold.": "纤细的精灵用斗篷的一角擦拭着她的眼镜，因为她周围的灰尘已经落定。她的恩人付给她一大笔钱，让她找到这个被遗忘的地方，在翻阅了几周的古代地图之后，她已经把神庙的位置拼凑了出来。现在，她有一个决定要做。如果她向她的恩人报告寺庙的位置，它的贵重物品将被无情地剥夺。但是，如果她把位置藏起来，她就可以保留其中被遗忘已久的知识。对于一个知识分子来说，知识比任何黄金都要珍贵。",
	"The aging human warrior silently assessed the soldiers under his command. They were exhausted and almost out of supplies. It was the tenth day of the siege, and the graying warrior knew that no reinforcements were coming to their rescue. He was too old to be of much use in battle, but if his soldiers followed his orders without hesitation, they might have a chance of survival. He stood up, and for what could be the last time, he tightened his belt and drew his sword.": "这位年迈的人类战士默默地评估着他手下的士兵。他们已经筋疲力尽，几乎没有补给了。这是围困的第十天，这位白发苍苍的战士知道，没有援军会来救他们。他太老了，在战斗中没有什么用处，但如果他的士兵毫不犹豫地听从他的命令，他们可能会有生存的机会。他站了起来，这可能是最后一次，他紧了紧腰带，拔出了他的剑。",
	"A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands shook as he examined his brother's wounds.

	"There are many wonderfully intelligent people in the world, but few are true savants. Born with the innate desire to learn anything they can, and the potential for genius-level intellect, savants spend their lives learning anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognizable at an early age, a savant's unquenchable hunger for knowledge draws them to the great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. They are willing to go to any lengths to unlock the secrets of the world, often turning to lives of adventure. For a savant, no price is too steep for the promise of discovery.": "世界上有许多聪明绝顶的人，但很少有人是真正的救世主。天生就有学习任何东西的欲望，而且有天才级智力的潜力，救世主一生都在学习他们周围人愿意教的任何东西。常常在很小的时候就能辨认出来，救世主对知识的无止境的渴望吸引他们去大图书馆、大学和其他高等学府。他们愿意不惜一切代价来解开世界的秘密，往往转向冒险的生活。对于知识分子来说，为了探索的承诺，没有什么代价是太沉重的。",
	"Savants are hyper-focused on their chosen area of study and often become obsessed with learning all they can about their specialty. In their quest for discovery, savants are willing to set aside any conviction, political, religious, or otherwise, to acquire the information they seek. To them, their desire for knowledge is more important than loyalty to any ideology. Often at great cost, savants will continue researching until they have made an indelible mark on their area of study.": "萨瓦特人非常专注于他们所选择的研究领域，并经常痴迷于学习有关他们专业的一切。在寻求发现的过程中，救世主愿意抛开任何信念，包括政治、宗教或其他方面的信念，来获取他们所寻求的信息。对他们来说，他们对知识的渴望比对任何意识形态的忠诚更重要。萨瓦特人通常会付出巨大的代价，继续研究，直到他们在自己的研究领域留下不可磨灭的痕迹。",
	"When creating a savant, consider their upbringing and level of formal education. Were they the star pupil of the finest university in the land, or did they come from poverty, fighting for any scrap of knowledge they could get their hands on? Also, consider why your savant relies only on their intellect, rather than the arcane or the patronage of a higher power.": "在创造救世主时，要考虑他们的成长经历和正规教育的水平。他们是这片土地上最好的大学的明星学生，还是来自贫困，为任何他们能得到的知识碎片而奋斗？此外，还要考虑为什么你的救世主只依赖他们的智力，而不是奥秘或更高力量的庇护。",
