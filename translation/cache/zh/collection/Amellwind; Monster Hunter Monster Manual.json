	"The loot tables are an addition to the ever growing supplement for playing a monster hunter styled D&D game. Each loot table was constructed using magical effects based on the creature's armor and weapons in the monster hunter video game series. In other cases, they are based off the creature's monster stat block or act as other magical items found within the 5e universe.

These monsters have been dubbed by academics as \"Pseudo Wyverns\" (Pseudo meaning \"False\" or \"Mimic\"), due to these species only displaying partial Wyvern traits.

	"Neopterons are insectoid monsters known for their rigid carapaces. These monsters can range in size from tiny to enormous, and some species can fly, while others cannot. Neopterons are situated in large groups rather than individually. Most carry poisonous stingers that can paralyze prey, and their bodies are made up of acidic substances.

The creature is almost as big as the recently discovered {@creature Xeno'jiiva|MHMM}, although it could move as fast as {@creature Nergigante|MHMM}. It also has powerful horns and claws that while seemingly have no special attribute to them, prove to be dangerous weapons when paired with their very muscular build. The combination of these physical traits allows Behemoth to pull quick and powerful attacks that cover a wide area in a continuous streak; one reason why fighting the monster alone is heavily advised against.": "这个巨兽的尺寸、重量和速度的比例很容易被描述为违背自然规律。这种生物几乎和最近发现的{@creature Xeno'jiiva|MHMM}一样大，尽管它的移动速度可以达到{@creature Nergigante|MHMM}。它还拥有强大的角和爪子，虽然看起来没有什么特别的属性，但当与它们非常强壮的肌肉搭配时，证明是危险的武器。这些身体特征的结合使贝希摩斯能够进行快速而有力的攻击，连续不断地覆盖广泛的区域；这也是为什么强烈建议不要与该怪物单独作战的原因之一。",
	"The behemoth also has the ability to cast magical attacks that is rather unnatural even compared to Elder Dragons.

However the Ecliptic Meteor seems to be very self-destructive towards behemoth itself, as they can die from using it too often or in heavily wounded state.": "巨兽还具有施展魔法攻击的能力，即使与长老龙相比，也是相当不自然的。同行的长老龙通常会产生、传导或操纵一种特定的物质或能量来产生强大的效果，而巨兽似乎可以凭空变出自然灾害。它可以召唤流星，使旋风出现在一个特定的地点，进行照明打击，最臭名昭著的是，从天空中召唤出一个巨大的岩石块，轻松摧毁对手，这一招叫做 \"黄道流星\"。然而，\"黄道流星 \"似乎对巨兽本身具有很强的自毁性，因为它们可能会因为过于频繁地使用它或在严重受伤的状态下死亡。",
	"Another unique trait of behemoth is its ability to develop \"Enmity\" towards a foe, which basically makes behemoth more focused and determined in a fight. This will be indicated with the behemoth's eye turning red and the body gaining reddish hue. However, it is a double-edged sword as in this state, behemoth could not heed proper attention to multiple opponent, making it vulnerable to flanking attacks.": "巨兽的另一个独特特征是它能够对敌人产生 \"敌意\"，这基本上使巨兽在战斗中更加专注和坚定。这将以巨兽的眼睛变成红色和身体获得红色的色调来表示。然而，这是一把双刃剑，因为在这种状态下，巨兽不能适当地注意到多个对手，使它容易受到侧翼攻击。",
	"The behemoth came from the entirely different world of Eorzea and thus does not consider any habitat charted by the Guild its home.

	"When it arrived in the Elder's Recess, it easily asserted itself as an unrivaled invader that could easily kill lesser monsters like {@creature dodogama|MHMM} with no effort and deter those fortunate enough to flee. Apparently, even Elder Dragons like nergigante, {@creature teostra|MHMM}, and {@creature kushala daora|MHMM} are reluctant to be in the Elder's Recess during the beast's time there. Behemoth thus made itself a threat to all life in the New World, so much in fact that the Commission deemed made it a priority target. It is almost a mandate for any hunter not to tackle the creature alone, a degree of caution reserved by the Guild for very few creatures.": "当它来到长老会的凹地时，它轻易地宣称自己是一个无敌的入侵者，可以不费吹灰之力地轻易杀死像{@creature dodogama|MHMM}这样的低等怪物，并阻止那些幸运的人逃离。显然，即使是像涅金特、{@creature teostra|MHMM}和{@creature kushala daora|MHMM}这样的长老龙也不愿意在巨兽在长老凹地的时候出现。贝希摩斯因此使自己成为新世界所有生命的威胁，事实上，委员会认为将其作为优先目标。对任何猎人来说，不单独对付这种生物几乎是一项任务，这是公会为极少数生物保留的一种谨慎程度。",
	"Either shocked for being transported into a different world or because of its natural mentality, behemoth has no tolerance towards Hunters, and will show almost immediate aggression, possibly because the creature also bear terrible relations with humanoids back in its original world.

On its back are a pair of wing-like appendages. Seemingly useless in terms of flight, these \"wings\" feature cannon-like chutes which can extrude globules of magma, both as a means of defense and as a way to jettison excess magma. Dire Miralis's head features a frill-like structure and an upturned snout.": "Dire Miralis是一种非常大的、半水生的长老龙。它的身体结构让人联想到（%0%），四肢相对较短，尾巴和脖子很长。它的身体充满了类似岩浆的物质，这些物质在尾巴的底部、胸部和每个肩膀处汇集。每个池子都能引导岩浆流向身体的某些部位。在它的背上有一对翅膀般的附属物。这些 \"翅膀 \"在飞行方面似乎毫无用处，但其特点是可以挤出岩浆球，既是一种防御手段，也是一种抛弃多余岩浆的方法。Dire Miralis的头部有一个类似褶皱的结构和一个上翘的鼻子。",

	"The Fatalis is a powerful, unnatural beast. The Fatalis's scales are extremely thick, while its shell is very durable. This is due to Fatalis melting the armor of its fallen prey on its shell, increasing its protection against some attacks. Fatalis doesn't seem to have very good eyesight, though this maybe partially be due to what its eyes are made of. Creepily, a Fatalis's eyes are made out of crystals. How is unknown. Fatalis's wing membrane is flexible, but as hard as metal. From this, Fatalis's wings don't break very easily, allowing it to fly at high speeds and support itself as it becomes airborne. Even on the ground, Fatalis is able to walk on all fours and rush prey at shocking speeds with sheer power behind its bulk. The most powerful feature is its powerful fiery breath. This fire is some of the strongest fire breath out of all monsters and can kill most enemies almost instantly. Recent encounters have revealed that Fatalis possess control over fire on par with Teostra and {@creature Lunastra|MHMM}. Its fire breath extends well beyond the length and height of the already large dragon.": "Fatalis是一种强大的、非自然的野兽。法塔利斯的鳞片非常厚，而它的外壳则非常耐用。这是由于法塔利斯将其倒下的猎物的盔甲融化在它的壳上，增加了它对某些攻击的保护。Fatalis似乎没有很好的视力，尽管这可能部分是由于它的眼睛是由什么构成的。令人毛骨悚然的是，Fatalis的眼睛是由水晶制成的。怎么做的不得而知。Fatalis的翼膜是灵活的，但像金属一样硬。由此可见，Fatalis的翅膀不容易折断，使它能够高速飞行，并在空中支撑自己。即使在地面上，Fatalis也能四肢着地，以惊人的速度冲向猎物，其体型背后的力量令人震惊。最强大的特征是它强大的火热气息。这种火是所有怪物中最强的火息，几乎可以瞬间杀死大多数敌人。最近的遭遇表明，法塔利斯拥有与泰奥斯特拉和（%0%）一样的对火的控制。它的火息远远超出了这只已经很大的龙的长度和高度。",
	"In some legends about the Fatalis, there is a legend known by some as the shifting scales of fate. This legend claims that the Second Coming of Fatalis is infinite. The Fatalis in this legend is quite different from the Fatalis seen in the other legends. This Fatalis is described to have six horns, a glowing blue chest, a short mane in between its spikes, bizarre fluids flowing through out its body, and the ability to shift its scales from black, red, or white. Each set of scales is said to grant the fatalis different abilities and protection. The most well known of these skills are the Black Flame and Crimson Demons breath that are said to combine the elements Fire and Death together, Despite both being combined together with the same elements, Each breath has a different element that seems to overtake this Fatalis's body, allowing it to do things not seen in other legends. This Fatalis is said to be able to send monsters running with a single flap of its wings.": "在一些关于法塔利斯的传说中，有一个被一些人称为命运天平变动的传说。这个传说声称，法塔利斯的第二次降临是无限的。这个传说中的法塔利斯与其他传说中看到的法塔利斯有很大不同。这个法塔利斯被描述为有六个角，一个发光的蓝色胸部，在它的尖刺之间有一个短的鬃毛，奇异的液体流经它的身体，并且有能力将它的鳞片从黑色、红色或白色转变。据说每套鳞片都能赋予法塔利斯不同的能力和保护。这些技能中最知名的是黑焰和深红恶魔的气息，据说它们将火和死亡元素结合在一起，尽管两者结合在一起的元素相同，但每一种气息都有不同的元素，似乎超越了这个法塔利斯的身体，使它能够做其他传说中没有的事情。据说这个Fatalis只要扇动一下翅膀，就能让怪物跑掉。",
	"A creepy light coming from its eyes invites those it stares at into its dark depths. The fluids are said to have no exact weight. Its shell is impervious to strikes from weapons and has terrifying power inside of it, which could be unleashed at anytime. The scariest part about this legend is that not only is its strength far beyond the ones from the other legends, but its body shows signs of possible regenerative powers. This means that this Fatalis maybe able to regenerate after taking large amounts of damage, just like Dire Miralis can regenerate from its still beating heart. Thankfully, this legend hasn't been proven as of yet so the Guild has nothing to worry about.": "它的眼睛发出令人毛骨悚然的光，吸引着它盯着的人进入其黑暗的深处。据说这些液体没有确切的重量。它的外壳不受武器的打击，里面有可怕的力量，随时可以释放出来。这个传说最可怕的地方在于，它的力量不仅远远超过其他传说中的力量，而且它的身体还显示出可能有再生能力的迹象。这意味着这个Fatalis也许能够在受到大量伤害后再生，就像Dire Miralis能够从其仍然跳动的心脏中再生一样。值得庆幸的是，这个传说到目前为止还没有被证实，所以公会没有什么可担心的。",
	"One thing that all the legends share about Fatalis is its equipment. This equipment is much more than what it appears to be. When adventurers wear this monster's armor, they are known to disappear mysteriously without a trace or even die if the armor is worn for too long. Some who have worn the Fatalis's armor report having terrible nightmares, unsettling strength, and a feeling as if they were being possessed by something. They also report feeling a familiar pulse coming from the armor, a feeling as if their legs were taken from them. With some adventurers wearing the armor of the Black Flame, they report feeling as if their body was taken over while they were unconscious. It is said that this equipment might be alive, meaning that Fatalis might not truly be dead. In Pokke Village, a giant black blade embedded in the ice is known to regenerate days after being mined once, which supports this claim that Fatalis is still alive. Other Fatalis weapons also seem to suggest that Fatalis is still alive in some form. Some weapons despair eat at the user's hands while other weapons, when held, have hideous abyssal screams coming from them. Some weapons even have a thirst for blood. From this, it is said that it's best to not to use any equipment from Fatalis in any form at all.": "关于Fatalis，所有传奇都有一个共同点，就是它的装备。这种装备远比它表面上看起来的要多。当冒险者穿上这种怪物的盔甲时，据说他们会神秘地消失得无影无踪，如果盔甲穿得太久甚至会死亡。一些穿了Fatalis盔甲的人报告说，他们做了可怕的噩梦，有令人不安的力量，并有一种仿佛被什么东西附身的感觉。他们还报告说感觉到一种来自盔甲的熟悉的脉搏，一种仿佛他们的腿被夺走的感觉。一些穿着黑焰盔甲的冒险者报告说，他们感觉自己的身体在昏迷时被人接管了。据说这种装备可能还活着，这意味着法塔里斯可能并没有真正死去。在波克村，人们知道嵌入冰中的巨大黑刀在被开采一次后几天就会再生，这支持了法塔里斯仍然活着的这种说法。其他Fatalis武器似乎也表明Fatalis仍然以某种形式活着。一些武器会绝望地吞噬使用者的双手，而其他武器，当被握住时，会发出狰狞的深渊般的尖叫。有些武器甚至对血有一种渴求。由此可见，最好不要以任何形式使用来自Fatalis的任何装备。",
	"Fatalis is extremely hostile to all living things. It threatens the very existence of not only the Castle Schrade, but the very world around it. In legend, it is said Fatalis could scorch the whole world with its flames in a few days, burning all lands to a crisp. Due to this, the Guild will secretly send adventurers to hunt it down to prevent public panic. However, most adventurers never return. Due to many incidents surrounding Schrade Kingdom and Fatalis, the Adventurer's Guild has classified everything about both away from the public. Fatalis's armor and quest are only allowed to those that have proven they are quite credible.": "Fatalis对所有生物都有极大的敌意。它不仅威胁到施拉德城堡的生存，而且威胁到它周围的世界。在传说中，据说Fatalis可以在几天内用它的火焰烧毁整个世界，将所有土地烧成灰烬。由于这个原因，公会会秘密派遣冒险者去追捕它，以防止公众恐慌。然而，大多数冒险者都没有回来。由于围绕施拉德王国和法塔利斯的许多事件，冒险家协会将有关这两者的一切都归类为远离公众。法塔利斯的盔甲和任务只允许给那些已经证明他们相当可信的人。",

	"Glavenus is a large Brute Wyvern with dark red scales covering its body. Two rows of blue, bony plates run along its back, going from the eyes to the tail. Its underside is more of a cream color.

	"Glavenus's most striking feature is its blade-like tail. The blade-like tail is used in many ways by Glavenus such as keeping the body balanced but its primary use is for attacking. This tail can cut prey in two with a single slash, crack the ground easily, and even block some attacks. Though its tail is already a powerful weapon, it can become more dangerous once heated up. By grinding its tail on the ground or nearby hard surfaces violently, it can ignite the tail, heating it up to high temperatures. While its tail is heated all of its tail-based attacks become more deadly, also allowing it to cut through objects much more easily.": "格拉文斯最引人注目的特征是它的刀状尾巴。刀状的尾巴被格拉文斯用在很多方面，比如保持身体平衡，但其主要用途是攻击。这条尾巴可以一刀把猎物切成两半，轻易地裂开地面，甚至可以阻挡一些攻击。虽然它的尾巴已经是一种强大的武器，但一旦加热就会变得更加危险。通过在地面或附近的坚硬表面上猛烈研磨它的尾巴，它可以点燃尾巴，将其加热到高温。当它的尾巴被加热时，它所有基于尾巴的攻击都变得更加致命，也使它能够更容易地切开物体。",

	"Gogmazios is a massive Elder Dragon with a body structure similar in nature to that of {@creature Gore Magala|MHMM} and {@creature Shagaru Magala|MHMM}. An adult Gogmazios is approximately 4920.5cm long and standing at a height of about 1708.5cm. It has a large, heavy head with red eyes and rows of sharp teeth. When it uses its Oil laser attack, a glowing pattern, reminiscent of a scowl, is present beneath its chin, giving it the semblance of a second face. Its wingarms feature membranes that almost completely retract when not in use, and its body is covered in thick, powerful scales, carapaces, and spines of an indigo colouration. Perhaps the most notable features of Gogmazios's body are the ever-present covering of a sticky, tar-like substance which it uses to incapacitate prey. It is unknown where Gogmazios exactly lives but it is theorized by scholars that it comes from swamps along with some mountainous habitats.": "Gogmazios是一种巨大的长老龙，其身体结构与（%0%）和（%1%）的性质相似。一个成年的Gogmazios大约有4920.5厘米长，站立高度约为1708.5厘米。它有一个大而沉重的头，红色的眼睛和一排排锋利的牙齿。当它使用石油激光攻击时，在它的下巴下面有一个发光的图案，让人联想到皱眉头，使它有了第二个脸的感觉。它的翼臂的特点是在不使用时几乎完全缩回，它的身体覆盖着厚实而有力的鳞片、甲壳和靛蓝色的刺。也许Gogmazios身体最显著的特征是永远覆盖着一种粘稠的、类似焦油的物质，它用这种物质来使猎物丧失能力。目前还不知道Gogmazios具体生活在哪里，但据学者们推测，它来自沼泽和一些山区的栖息地。",
	"Despite Gogmazios's habitat being unknown, Gogmazios are known to feed sulfur, which can be found in gunpowder and explosives. This was discovered after one raided Dundroma's Weapon Warehouse for many years and was seen feeding on the explosives. From this it can be assumed that Gogmazios may also feed on ore though Gogmazios hasn't been seen interacting with other monsters so this is just a hypothesis by scholars. Gogmazios aren't the most aggressive Elder Dragons, but certainly aren't harmless and will attack if threatened. Gogmazios are known to hibernate underground for a very long period of time, spanning to a few years or even several decades, when it has obtained enough food, but waking up to feed again when food is needed.": "尽管Gogmazios的栖息地不详，但人们知道Gogmazios以硫磺为食，这可以在火药和炸药中找到。这是在一只突袭邓卓玛的武器仓库多年后发现的，它被看到以炸药为食。由此可以推测，Gogmazios也可能以矿石为食，尽管Gogmazios还没有被看到与其他怪物互动，所以这只是学者们的一个假设。Gogmazios并不是最具攻击性的长老龙，但肯定不是无害的，如果受到威胁就会攻击。众所周知，Gogmazios会在地下冬眠很长一段时间，跨越几年甚至几十年，当它获得足够的食物时，但在需要食物时又会醒过来进食。",
	"Unlike most other Elder Dragons, Gogmazios has an extra pair of limbs that allow it to walk better and allow it to walk upright. From the large amounts of muscles found inside these limbs, Gogmazios is able to walk upright with very much ease and to battle some threats at close range. These extra pair of limbs even allow Gogmazios to fly with its powerful wings. The wings of Gogmazios aren't tattered. The oil on its body has actually stuck the wings to its arms due to it hardening. When greatly angered, the heat will cause the oil to evaporate from its wings and Gogmazios forces itself in the air to fly. Gogmazios don't fly easily and rarely ever fly. Gogmazios has oil circulating throughout its body, while some of the oil pours out of its body. The oil coming out of a Gogmazios is impurities, such as waste or sweat, from its skin due to its diet. The oil pours out from its chest and back, dripping onto the ground below it. This oil is very sticky, attaching to anything that it touches. Inside some of the oil is objects that were picked up by Gogmazios accidentally. These objects can be weapons, artifacts, arrows, and living organisms. Some of the oil has hardened on Gogmazios's body, increasing the strength of its scales and shell, giving it better defense against potential threats. Also, found inside of its body and inside its extra limbs are special organs that allow it to produce heated fire. Gogmazios uses this fire as a tool to ignite the oil and to make its attacks deadlier then before. When greatly enraged, Gogmazios's body temperature will increase greatly, making the oil it produces ignite faster and heat up faster without much warning.": "与其他大多数长老龙不同，Gogmazios有一对额外的四肢，使它能更好地行走，并能直立行走。从这些四肢内发现的大量肌肉来看，Gogmazios能够非常轻松地直立行走，并能在近距离内与一些威胁作战。这些额外的四肢甚至可以让Gogmazios用它强大的翅膀飞行。Gogmazios的翅膀并不破烂。它身上的油由于变硬，实际上已经把翅膀粘在了它的手臂上。当被大大激怒时，热量会使油从它的翅膀上蒸发，Gogmazios会强迫自己在空中飞行。Gogmazios不容易飞，也很少飞过。Gogmazios全身都有油在循环，而一些油则从它的身体里涌出。从Gogmazios体内涌出的油是它的皮肤因饮食而产生的杂质，如废物或汗水。油从它的胸部和背部涌出，滴落在它下面的地面上。这种油非常粘稠，附着在它所接触的任何东西上。一些油里面是被戈格玛兹奥斯意外捡到的物体。这些物体可以是武器、工艺品、箭和生物体。一些油在Gogmazios的身上变硬，增加了它的鳞片和外壳的强度，使它能更好地防御潜在的威胁。此外，在它的身体内部和额外的四肢内发现了特殊的器官，使它能够产生加热的火。Gogmazios用这种火作为点燃油的工具，使它的攻击比以前更致命。当被大大激怒时，Gogmazios的体温会大大增加，使它产生的油在没有太多警告的情况下更快地被点燃和升温。",

	"Gore Magala has an unusually high metabolism but rarely feeds on much prey. Due to this metabolism, its hairs on its wings are constantly left behind and flying in the air. These hairs are used to understand their environment and leave behind a trail that Gore Magala uses to see both predators and prey by heat. Once it smells something in the area, it will begin to spread around its hairs around the area in order to find the target and these hairs will attach onto the target, allowing the Gore Magala to see them with heat. As Gore Magala's senses increase and become better from these hairs, its color under its wings will slowly change and get brighter. When its sense are at their highest peak, two antennae will appear from its head and it will release a large amounts of hairs into the air. The hairs in the sky will darken the sky as if an eclipse was in the area and it will begin to walk on all six. This is its Frenzy State. When it enters this state, it will begin to use its wing claws to allow it to walk and attack better using them.

The Frenzy Virus causes some abnormalities in the nervous system, increased physical strength, and a decrease in the body's resistance. This virus makes all monsters extremely violent and eventually kills most of them.

	"Like most other Leviathans, Mizutsune has a long, slender body. However, it is one of the few Leviathans to actually have fur on its body. This fur covers its chest, underbelly, legs and tail. Its scales are light colored and resemble those of a fish. Its head has a long snout and is beautifully adorned by many fin-like appendages. These fins are pink with yellow markings, and they can also be seen on its back and tail. Its feet are said to be quite different from other Leviathans and allow Mizutsune to move swiftly on land.": "与其他大多数利维坦类动物一样，Mizutsune有一个细长的身体。然而，它是少数几个身体上真正有毛的利维坦人之一。这种毛皮覆盖了它的胸部、腹部、腿和尾巴。它的鳞片是浅色的，类似于鱼的鳞片。它的头部有一个长长的鼻子，上面有许多鳍状的附属物，装饰得非常漂亮。这些鳍是粉红色的，有黄色的斑纹，在它的背部和尾部也可以看到这些鳍。它的脚据说与其他利维坦人截然不同，可以让水月在陆地上迅速移动。",
	"Mizutsune's most unique adaption is its ability to produce bubbles. It is able to produce the bubbles by using special fluid secretions, produced from its own body along with water, and rubbing its hairs in the secretions. These stiff yet soft purple hairs are found on its chest, tail, legs, and sides. The hairs are used for sliding on the fluids it produces, spreading the fluids, and even using the fluids to produce more bubbles. Mizutsune can also breath these bubbly fluids from its mouth. It is known to use the bubbles it produces both offensively and defensively in battle. It uses the bubbles to help it move faster and to make it more flexible in battle, while simultaneously impeding the movement of any foes. In order to stop itself quickly while moving, Mizutsune has special hook-like claws that allow it to stop sliding quickly to face threats and not leave itself open. Despite Mizutsune's strange appearance, the fins it has actually act as receptors for detecting the presence of predators and prey coming through vibrations in the secretions. Like a snake, Mizutsune's teeth are recurved to prevent prey from escaping easily. Its jaws are even designed like a snake to an extent, even being able to open its mouth wide and swallow some large prey. It can also fire pressurized jets of water from its mouth, much like {@creature Plesioth|MHMM}.": "Mizutsune最独特的适应能力是它产生气泡的能力。它能够通过使用特殊的液体分泌物来产生气泡，这些分泌物由它自己的身体和水一起产生，并在分泌物中摩擦它的毛发。这些坚硬而柔软的紫色毛发在它的胸部、尾部、腿部和侧面都有。这些毛发用于在它产生的液体上滑动，传播液体，甚至利用液体来产生更多的气泡。水蛇还可以从它的嘴里呼出这些泡沫状的液体。众所周知，它在战斗中既能利用其产生的气泡进行进攻，也能利用其进行防守。它利用气泡来帮助自己快速移动，使自己在战斗中更加灵活，同时阻碍任何敌人的移动。为了在移动时迅速停止自己，Mizutsune有特殊的钩状爪子，使它能够迅速停止滑动，以面对威胁，而不至于让自己暴露。尽管Mizutsune的外表很奇怪，但它的鳍实际上是作为受体，通过分泌物的振动来探测捕食者和猎物的存在。像蛇一样，Mizutsune的牙齿是下弯的，以防止猎物轻易逃脱。它的下巴甚至在某种程度上设计得像蛇，甚至能够张开大嘴吞下一些大型猎物。它还可以从嘴里发射加压水柱，很像（%0%）。",
	"Mizutsune are rather calm in nature until provoked. They prefer to be left alone resting near large bodies of water, while covered in their special secretions. They prefer to avoid confrontations, however, will defend themselves if need be. Once a threat has left, Mizutsune won't chase after the threat but will instead let it go. Though Mizutsune are usually calm, they are known to turn aggressive during Breeding Season. Mizutsune become aggressive or even berserk during their Breeding Season. In this season, it is not a good idea to go fishing from them being known to injure people due to their blind rage. Male Mizutsune have large fins and are able to flash their fins red to show emotion to the female Mizutsune, in order to attract them.": "Mizutsune的天性相当平静，直到被激怒。他们更喜欢独自在大水体附近休息，同时身上沾满他们的特殊分泌物。它们喜欢避免对抗，然而，如果需要的话，它们会保护自己。一旦威胁离开，Mizutsune不会追赶威胁，而是会让它离开。虽然Mizutsune通常很平静，但它们在繁殖季节会变得很有攻击性。在繁殖季节，水蛇会变得具有攻击性，甚至是狂暴。在这个季节，去钓鱼并不是一个好主意，因为它们会因为盲目的愤怒而伤人。雄性水曲柳有很大的鱼鳍，能够向雌性水曲柳展示它们的红色鱼鳍，以吸引它们。",

The only real likely things that could potentially threaten a Nakarkos are other Elder Dragons like older Ceadeus, their only known predator.": "无论环境如何，Nakarkos都能轻易地宣称自己是顶级捕食者。这些长老龙已被确认以装甲猎物为食，如（%0%）和（%1%），甚至是（%2%）、（%3%）和（%4%）等顶级捕食者。即使是能够飞行的怪物物种也不可能在这种怪物面前安全。这些长老龙被发现的最令人震惊的生物是（%5%）和（%6%）幼崽。其他猎物包括（%7%）和（%8%）。唯一真正有可能威胁到Nakarkos的是其他长老龙，如年长的Ceadeus，他们唯一已知的天敌。",
	"Nakarkos are gluttons that can eat a whole ecosystem if left unchecked. Due to Nakarkos having huge appetites, they can easily wipe out all life in surrounding areas. Nakarkos have even been reported shooting down airships for food. Though Nakarkos can destroy an ecosystem, it doesn't actually want to do that. It prefers to leave its nest in search of prey so, it still have plenty of food at the environment it is living within. If the adventurer's Guild finds a Nakarkos' lair, they will immediately send adventurer to repel it before it can bring further damage to that ecosystem. However, it is said that Nakarkos will eventually return to said area in order to feed themselves further.": "Nakarkos是一个贪婪的人，如果不加以控制，可以吃掉整个生态系统。由于Nakarkos有巨大的胃口，它们可以轻易地消灭周围地区的所有生命。据报道，Nakarkos甚至为了食物而击落飞艇。虽然Nakarkos可以破坏一个生态系统，但它实际上并不想这样做。它更喜欢离开自己的巢穴去寻找猎物，这样，它在自己生活的环境中仍然有很多食物。如果冒险家协会发现了Nakarkos的巢穴，他们会立即派冒险家去驱赶它，以免它给生态系统带来进一步的破坏。然而，据说Nakarkos最终会回到上述地区，以进一步养活自己。",
	"Nakarkos is able to produce an eerie, blue mucus from its body. This mucus is sticky, allowing it to capture prey and even shoot prey items out of the air. Though this mucus is used for capturing prey, Nakarkos has another use for the mucus. This mucus is used to help prevent bones from corroding, sticking bones together, and to prevent the bones from collapsing. With this mucus, it can make a protective bone armor to protect its whole body from attacks and even use some bones as weapons. Like a cuttlefish, it has sticky tentacles used to drag prey back to its lair. These tentacles are usually covered in bones for protection, ending with a huge skull. But this isn't just limited to skulls. Nakarkos has been seen using various monster parts to attack foes or to kill prey with. Some of these parts are hard to identify due to Nakarkos altering their shapes in order for it to use them. Some parts that it has been seen using is a fused together Glavenus jaw and tail, a {@creature Lagiacrus|MHMM}'s shell shockers, a Brachydios's pounders, and a Uragaan's chin.": "Nakarkos能够从其身体中产生一种阴森的蓝色粘液。这种粘液具有粘性，使它能够捕捉猎物，甚至将猎物射出空气。虽然这种粘液是用来捕捉猎物的，但纳卡克斯对这种粘液还有另一种用途。这种粘液用于帮助防止骨头被腐蚀，将骨头粘在一起，并防止骨头塌陷。有了这种粘液，它可以做一个保护性的骨甲，保护它的整个身体不受攻击，甚至把一些骨头当作武器。像墨鱼一样，它有粘性的触手，用来把猎物拖回它的巢穴。这些触手通常被骨头覆盖以提供保护，最后是一个巨大的头骨。但这并不仅仅限于头骨。人们看到纳卡克斯使用各种怪物的部件来攻击敌人或用它们来杀死猎物。由于Nakarkos为了使用这些部件而改变了它们的形状，所以其中一些部件很难识别。它所使用的一些部件是融合在一起的Glavenus下巴和尾巴，{@creature Lagiacrus|MHMM}的炮弹冲击器，Brachydios的重击器，以及Uragaan的下巴。",
	"These various parts give the appearance that it has \"two heads\" but Nakarkos's true head is hidden away underground most of the time. When it feels its life is truly in danger, it will eventually reveal its true face. Its true face is cephalopod-like, resembling a cuttlefish. By revealing its face, it can use its bone-crunching beak. So to make it easier for itself to use the Fire Beam, it will fire the element from its tentacles and build it up in its mouth before firing a massive beam. To move quickly, Nakarkos has jet propulsion like squids. It uses this to return to its nest at a quicker rate, so it can avoid getting eaten itself.": "这些不同的部分给人的感觉是它有 \"两个头\"，但Nakarkos的真正的头在大部分时间里都隐藏在地下。当它觉得自己的生命真的有危险时，它最终会露出自己的真面目。它的真面目是头足类动物，类似于墨鱼。露出脸来，它就可以使用它的碎骨喙了。因此，为了使自己更容易使用火光束，它将从触手中发射元素，并在发射巨大的光束之前将其积聚在口中。为了快速移动，Nakarkos拥有像鱿鱼一样的喷射推进器。它利用这一点以更快的速度返回它的巢穴，这样它就可以避免自己被吃掉。",

	"Nergigante doesn't have a gender and reproduces asexually. It needs large quantities of bioenergy to propagate, but the way it does so is bizarre compared to other species. When Nergigante regenerates its spikes, some of them may gain the bioenergy it has used and begin to produce germ cells, allowing Nergigante to produce another of its kind without the need of a mate. Since Nergigante needs more bioenergy than usual to produce the next generation, it needs to find a food source with incredible strength. Interestingly, the offspring are genetically identical to their parent.": "涅伽特没有性别，进行无性繁殖。它需要大量的生物能量来繁殖，但与其他物种相比，它的繁殖方式很奇特。当Nergigante再生它的尖峰时，其中一些尖峰可能会获得它所使用的生物能量，并开始产生生殖细胞，使Nergigante能够在不需要配偶的情况下产生另一个同类。由于Nergigante需要比平时更多的生物能来产生下一代，它需要找到一个具有难以置信的力量的食物来源。有趣的是，后代的基因与它们的父母完全相同。",
