	"The loot tables are an addition to the ever growing supplement for playing a monster hunter styled D&D game. Each loot table was constructed using magical effects based on the creature's armor and weapons in the monster hunter video game series. In other cases, they are based off the creature's monster stat block or act as other magical items found within the 5e universe. The effects are also based on when the PCs will typically fight these creatures.

	"Brute Wyverns are considered to be Wyverns that are adapted to complete life on land, even sometimes being called Theropods from greatly resembling some predatory dinosaurs. These monsters are typically large, bipedal theropods, that are prone to living in areas abundant in food sources.

	"A very broad term, the only thing in common amongst all elder dragons is their power which seems to border the mystical as opposed to the wyverns which are all limited to natural laws.

Some, due to their sheer size and weight are able to hover in the air for a brief time. that have two wings. These Wyverns are known as \"True Wyverns\". However, there are some Wyverns that are quadrupedal, operating their wingarms as forearms instead like Tigrex and Nargacuga. These monsters have been dubbed by academics as \"Pseudo Wyverns\" (Pseudo meaning \"False\" or \"Mimic\"), due to these species only displaying partial Wyvern traits. Some are flightless despite their classification as Flying Wyverns, like the Akantor and Ukanlos. These wyverns show their Wyvern ancestry by the small forewings on their two front limbs.

	"Neopterons are insectoid monsters known for their rigid carapaces. These monsters can range in size from tiny to enormous, and some species can fly, while others cannot. Neopterons are situated in large groups rather than individually. Most carry poisonous stingers that can paralyze prey, and their bodies are made up of acidic substances. Their weak outer-shell structures means that they are easily damaged, making it difficult to obtain adequate materials from their remains.

The creature is almost as big as the recently discovered {@creature Xeno'jiiva|MHMM}, although it could move as fast as {@creature Nergigante|MHMM}. It also has powerful horns and claws that while seemingly have no special attribute to them, prove to be dangerous weapons when paired with their very muscular build. The combination of these physical traits allows Behemoth to pull quick and powerful attacks that cover a wide area in a continuous streak; one reason why fighting the monster alone is heavily advised against.": "这个巨兽的尺寸、重量和速度的比例很容易被描述为违背自然规律。这种生物几乎和最近发现的{@creature Xeno'jiiva|MHMM}一样大，尽管它的移动速度可以达到{@creature Nergigante|MHMM}。它还拥有强大的角和爪子，虽然看起来没有什么特别的属性，但当与它们非常强壮的肌肉搭配时，证明是危险的武器。这些身体特征的结合使贝希摩斯能够进行快速而有力的攻击，连续不断地覆盖广泛的区域；这也是为什么强烈建议不要与该怪物单独作战的原因之一。",
	"The behemoth also has the ability to cast magical attacks that is rather unnatural even compared to Elder Dragons. While fellow Elder Dragons commonly generate, conduct or manipulate a specific substance or energy to produce powerful effects, Behemoth seemingly conjure natural disasters out of thin air: It can summon meteors, make whirlwind to appear in a specific spot, make lighting strikes and most infamously, summon a titanic mass of rock from the sky to easily destroy would be-opponents, a move called \"Ecliptic Meteor\". However the Ecliptic Meteor seems to be very self-destructive towards behemoth itself, as they can die from using it too often or in heavily wounded state.": "巨兽还具有施展魔法攻击的能力，即使与长老龙相比，也是相当不自然的。同行的长老龙通常会产生、传导或操纵一种特定的物质或能量来产生强大的效果，而巨兽似乎可以凭空变出自然灾害。它可以召唤流星，使旋风出现在一个特定的地点，进行照明打击，最臭名昭著的是，从天空中召唤出一个巨大的岩石块，轻松摧毁对手，这一招叫做 \"黄道流星\"。然而，\"黄道流星 \"似乎对巨兽本身具有很强的自毁性，因为它们可能会因为过于频繁地使用它或在严重受伤的状态下死亡。",
	"Another unique trait of behemoth is its ability to develop \"Enmity\" towards a foe, which basically makes behemoth more focused and determined in a fight. This will be indicated with the behemoth's eye turning red and the body gaining reddish hue. However, it is a double-edged sword as in this state, behemoth could not heed proper attention to multiple opponent, making it vulnerable to flanking attacks.": "巨兽的另一个独特特征是它能够对敌人产生 \"敌意\"，这基本上使巨兽在战斗中更加专注和坚定。这将以巨兽的眼睛变成红色和身体获得红色的色调来表示。然而，这是一把双刃剑，因为在这种状态下，巨兽不能适当地注意到多个对手，使它容易受到侧翼攻击。",
	"The behemoth came from the entirely different world of Eorzea and thus does not consider any habitat charted by the Guild its home.

	"When it arrived in the Elder's Recess, it easily asserted itself as an unrivaled invader that could easily kill lesser monsters like {@creature dodogama|MHMM} with no effort and deter those fortunate enough to flee. Apparently, even Elder Dragons like nergigante, {@creature teostra|MHMM}, and {@creature kushala daora|MHMM} are reluctant to be in the Elder's Recess during the beast's time there. Behemoth thus made itself a threat to all life in the New World, so much in fact that the Commission deemed made it a priority target. It is almost a mandate for any hunter not to tackle the creature alone, a degree of caution reserved by the Guild for very few creatures.": "当它来到长老会的凹地时，它轻易地宣称自己是一个无敌的入侵者，可以不费吹灰之力地轻易杀死像{@creature dodogama|MHMM}这样的低等怪物，并阻止那些幸运的人逃离。显然，即使是像涅金特、{@creature teostra|MHMM}和{@creature kushala daora|MHMM}这样的长老龙也不愿意在巨兽在长老凹地的时候出现。贝希摩斯因此使自己成为新世界所有生命的威胁，事实上，委员会认为将其作为优先目标。对任何猎人来说，不单独对付这种生物几乎是一项任务，这是公会为极少数生物保留的一种谨慎程度。",
	"Either shocked for being transported into a different world or because of its natural mentality, behemoth has no tolerance towards Hunters, and will show almost immediate aggression, possibly because the creature also bear terrible relations with humanoids back in its original world.
