The arrow might also light highly-flammable materials that it touches, like thatched rooves, dry crops, and the like.": "这种箭头在尖端后面有一个小的、球形的笼子。笼子里装着浸泡在助燃剂中的可燃纤维材料，就像火把用的材料一样。弓箭手可以花一个额外的动作来敲击这支箭，并在射击前将箭尖浸入一个活跃的火源。点燃的火箭会给弓箭的攻击增加{@damage 1}的火焰伤害。这支箭也可能点燃它所接触到的高度易燃的材料，比如茅草屋、干燥的农作物等等。",
	"This arrow is crafted of materials carefully selected for their aerodynamic properties. With lighter heads and superior fletching, flight arrows are tremendously accurate missiles. When using this ammunition, both the bow's range increments are increased by a distance equal to the weapon's normal range increment. When firing a flight arrow, apply a 1 penalty to the damage roll.": "这种箭由精心挑选的材料制成，具有空气动力学特性。有了更轻的箭头和出色的弹夹，飞行箭是非常精确的导弹。当使用这种弹药时，弓的射程增量都会增加，其距离等于武器的正常射程增量。当发射飞行箭时，对伤害卷进行1的惩罚。",

	"This heavy crossbow bolt bears a large, spongy head soaked in bright ink. The bolt is typically carried inside a wax coating that covers the head to preserve the ink prior to use. The wax coating on the head of this bolt can be removed as a bonus action during loading, making it ready to fire. Anything the missile hits is splattered with the bright ink. Such bolts are often used by spotters in battle to mark certain targets. By prearranged agreement, this focuses the attention of allied ranged units like archers and war wizards.

Because of their shape, stabilized crossbow bolts cannot be loaded into a repeating crossbow magazine.": "这种弩箭是用靶尖和一些小的弹片制作的。当使用这种弹药时，十字弓的射程增量都会增加相当于武器的正常射程增量的距离。当发射稳定的弩箭时，对伤害卷施加1的惩罚。由于它们的形状，稳定弩箭不能被装入连发弩的弹夹。",
	"This sling bullet is a clay sphere, larger than a normal sling bullet, designed to shatter on impact. Any liquid that is effective on contact can be placed into it, including acid, alchemical solvent, alchemist's fire, defoliant, holy water, and all sorts of contact poisons. When fired from a sling, this sling bullet halves the weapon's normal and long range increments and changes its damage to {@damage 1d2} bludgeoning. In addition to damage, a successful ranged attack applies the contained liquid to the target, as though it had been delivered via its normal means.": "这种吊弹是一个粘土球，比普通的吊弹要大，被设计成一经撞击就会碎裂。任何接触有效的液体都可以放入其中，包括酸、炼金溶剂、炼金术士之火、脱叶剂、圣水和各种接触毒药。当从吊索发射时，这种吊索子弹将武器的普通和远距离增量减半，并将其伤害改为（%0%）重击。除了伤害之外，成功的远程攻击会将所含的液体施加到目标身上，就像通过其正常方式传递一样。",

	"This armor constitutes an ostentatious display of wealth. It is crafted as scale armor but uses coins instead of scales. Each coin is punched with holes used to tie the coin scales together and each coin is backed with steel to offset the weakness of the metals used in the coins. A suit of coin armor requires 2,000 coins; this additional expense (variable based on the coins' types) is added to the cost of the armor but does not affect crafting times.": "这种盔甲是财富的炫耀性展示。它与鳞甲一样制作，但用硬币代替鳞片。每枚硬币都被打上了孔，用来将硬币的鳞片绑在一起，每枚硬币都有钢的支撑，以抵消硬币中使用的金属的弱点。一套硬币盔甲需要2000个硬币；这笔额外的费用（根据硬币的类型而变化）会加到盔甲的成本中，但不影响制作时间。",

The shikaro requires 1 round of drilling per hit point of the barrier drilled through, though it does not actually remove hit points from the object. When trying to make a spyhole subtly, you make a Dexterity (Subterfuge) check. (This is a non-standard pairing of an ability and a skill.) The check result sets the DC for an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check by anyone trying to find the spyhole. A person on the pinhole side who looks for it makes this check with disadvantage.": "该工具无视木材或类似韧性的材料的硬度。什卡洛每钻透一个障碍物的命中率需要1轮钻探，尽管它实际上并不从物体上去除命中率。当试图巧妙地打出一个间谍孔时，你要做一个灵巧（潜行）检查。(这是一个非标准的能力和技能的配对。)检查结果设定了任何试图找到这个间谍孔的人的智力({@skill Investigation})检查的DC。在针孔一侧寻找它的人进行这个检定时是不利的。",

	"You can attack a target within 15 feet by spraying it with the sprayer, which counts as an improvised weapon. Because of the wide, predictable dispersion of liquid, this attack roll has advantage. If it hits, the target is affected by the liquid contained within as though it had been splashed by a flask of the substance.": "你可以用喷雾器喷洒15英尺内的目标，这也算作一种简易武器。由于液体的散布范围很广，可以预测，这个攻击卷有优势。如果命中，目标会受到其中所含液体的影响，就像它被一壶该物质溅到一样。",
	"Sprayers can project oil, holy water, unholy water, defoliant, and many other liquids. They cannot use corrosive or caustic substances like acid or alchemical fire, as these will destroy the delicate internal components.

A strap attached to the tate allows it to be slung over the back for carrying when it is not deployed.": "塔特是一种沉重的、独立的防波堤。它由一个扁平的木质平面组成，有一个接合的腿，使它能够被设置在一个固定的位置，保护平面几乎垂直。附在塔特上的带子可以让它在没有部署的时候挂在背上携带。",
	"Placing a tate (or picking it up from a placed position) requires an action. Once placed, you can claim half cover while behind it, or three-quarters cover while prone behind it.": "放置石块（或从放置的位置拿起它）需要一个动作。一旦放置好，你可以在它后面要求半遮蔽，或者在它后面俯卧时要求四分之三的遮蔽。",

	"When using a battle mat, mark one entire side of the square you are in (corner to corner) when you place the tate. If a straight line from {@i either} unmarked corner of your square to any corner of the attacker's square touches a corner of the marked side or passes through it, the tate provides you with cover. Alternately, you can place the tate at an angle. Draw a diagonal line through the square you are in (connecting opposite corners), with a little arrow indicating which direction the tate is facing (the side you are not on).

	"A pavilion is a large, often circular shelter with room enough to stand in. Hanging curtains separate the interior into separate chambers, each large enough for a bed or a table. A pavilion can sleep up to 30 people in cramped quarters but is typically used to house a small group of important people.": "亭子是一个大的，通常是圆形的住所，有足够的空间可以站在里面。悬挂的窗帘将内部分隔成独立的房间，每个房间都大到可以放一张床或一张桌子。亭子可以在狭窄的地方睡下30人，但通常用于容纳一小群重要人物。",
