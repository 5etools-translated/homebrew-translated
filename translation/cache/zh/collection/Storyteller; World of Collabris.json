The arrow might also light highly-flammable materials that it touches, like thatched rooves, dry crops, and the like.": "这种箭头在尖端后面有一个小的、球形的笼子。笼子里装着浸泡在助燃剂中的可燃纤维材料，就像火把用的材料一样。弓箭手可以花一个额外的动作来敲击这支箭，并在射击前将箭尖浸入一个活跃的火源。点燃的火箭会给弓箭的攻击增加{@damage 1}的火焰伤害。这支箭也可能点燃它所接触到的高度易燃的材料，比如茅草屋、干燥的农作物等等。",
	"This arrow is crafted of materials carefully selected for their aerodynamic properties. With lighter heads and superior fletching, flight arrows are tremendously accurate missiles. When using this ammunition, both the bow's range increments are increased by a distance equal to the weapon's normal range increment. When firing a flight arrow, apply a 1 penalty to the damage roll.": "这种箭由精心挑选的材料制成，具有空气动力学特性。有了更轻的箭头和出色的弹夹，飞行箭是非常精确的导弹。当使用这种弹药时，弓的射程增量都会增加，其距离等于武器的正常射程增量。当发射飞行箭时，对伤害卷进行1的惩罚。",

	"This heavy crossbow bolt bears a large, spongy head soaked in bright ink. The bolt is typically carried inside a wax coating that covers the head to preserve the ink prior to use. The wax coating on the head of this bolt can be removed as a bonus action during loading, making it ready to fire. Anything the missile hits is splattered with the bright ink. Such bolts are often used by spotters in battle to mark certain targets. By prearranged agreement, this focuses the attention of allied ranged units like archers and war wizards.

Because of their shape, stabilized crossbow bolts cannot be loaded into a repeating crossbow magazine.": "这种弩箭是用靶尖和一些小的弹片制作的。当使用这种弹药时，十字弓的射程增量都会增加相当于武器的正常射程增量的距离。当发射稳定的弩箭时，对伤害卷施加1的惩罚。由于它们的形状，稳定弩箭不能被装入连发弩的弹夹。",
	"This sling bullet is a clay sphere, larger than a normal sling bullet, designed to shatter on impact. Any liquid that is effective on contact can be placed into it, including acid, alchemical solvent, alchemist's fire, defoliant, holy water, and all sorts of contact poisons. When fired from a sling, this sling bullet halves the weapon's normal and long range increments and changes its damage to {@damage 1d2} bludgeoning. In addition to damage, a successful ranged attack applies the contained liquid to the target, as though it had been delivered via its normal means.": "这种吊弹是一个粘土球，比普通的吊弹要大，被设计成一经撞击就会碎裂。任何接触有效的液体都可以放入其中，包括酸、炼金溶剂、炼金术士之火、脱叶剂、圣水和各种接触毒药。当从吊索发射时，这种吊索子弹将武器的普通和远距离增量减半，并将其伤害改为（%0%）重击。除了伤害之外，成功的远程攻击会将所含的液体施加到目标身上，就像通过其正常方式传递一样。",

	"This armor constitutes an ostentatious display of wealth. It is crafted as scale armor but uses coins instead of scales. Each coin is punched with holes used to tie the coin scales together and each coin is backed with steel to offset the weakness of the metals used in the coins. A suit of coin armor requires 2,000 coins; this additional expense (variable based on the coins' types) is added to the cost of the armor but does not affect crafting times.": "这种盔甲是财富的炫耀性展示。它与鳞甲一样制作，但用硬币代替鳞片。每枚硬币都被打上了孔，用来将硬币的鳞片绑在一起，每枚硬币都有钢的支撑，以抵消硬币中使用的金属的弱点。一套硬币盔甲需要2000个硬币；这笔额外的费用（根据硬币的类型而变化）会加到盔甲的成本中，但不影响制作时间。",

Meat feed lasts for only a week before it becomes spoiled and worthless.": "不同动物所需的食物类型有很大差异。杂食动物通常可以吃任何种类的饲料，以及口粮。食草动物，特别是马，可以靠草、干草和其他草木植物生存。高价值的饲料，如燕麦，只是一种奢侈品，对这类动物来说，一直吃是不健康的。狗和其他食肉动物的大部分饮食都需要肉类。作为饲料，这通常采取干肉屑或用吸收性谷物磨成的肉的形式。肉类饲料只能维持一个星期，然后就会变质，毫无价值。",
	"Most creatures can forage or hunt for themselves, given enough time and left to their own devices. Feed is only needed when animals are kept caged or stabled, worked or ridden longer than eight hours in a day, or otherwise prevented from finding their own food for significant portions of the day. Tiny creatures need only 1/4 pound of food per day for sustenance. Small and Medium creatures need 1 pound. Large creatures need 4 pounds, Huge creatures need 16 pounds, and Gargantuan creatures need 64 pounds of food per day. The DM is the final arbiter of each animal's needs for quantity and type of food.": "只要有足够的时间，大多数生物都能自己觅食或捕猎，让它们自己去做。只有当动物被关在笼子里或放在马厩里，一天工作或骑马超过8小时，或在一天的大部分时间里无法自己寻找食物时，才需要饲料。小动物每天只需要1/4磅的食物来维持生计。小型和中型生物需要1磅。大型生物需要4磅，巨大生物需要16磅，而巨型生物每天需要64磅食物。DM是每种动物对食物的数量和类型需求的最终仲裁者。",
	"A hobble is a set of manacles for an animal, particularly suited for equines like horses. Equines will typically graze in a small area while hobbled and can be left alone for hours. Other animals, like dogs, are less docile and will chew through the restraint; such creatures are typically leashed or picketed when left unattended. Some hobbles are built weakly enough that a truly panicked creature can break the binding, running away at full speed if attacked by a predator or otherwise seriously threatened. Hobbles are also used as training tools for animals that will serve as mounts and laborers.": "蹄铁是一套用于动物的手铐，特别适合马匹这样的马科动物。马匹在被拴住时通常会在一个小范围内吃草，可以独自呆上几个小时。其他动物，如狗，则不那么温顺，会咬破束缚；这类动物在无人看管的情况下，通常会被拴住或纠缠住。有些脚镣的强度很低，真正惊慌失措的动物可以挣脱束缚，在受到捕食者攻击或其他严重威胁时全速奔跑。脚镣也被用作训练动物的工具，这些动物将作为坐骑和劳动力。",
	"Applying or removing a hobble takes an action. A hobble reduces an animal's speed to 5 and discourages it from traveling far.": "施加或移除脚镣需要一个动作。绊脚石将动物的速度降低到5，并阻止其远行。",
	"This complex hobble can be used on docile animals of any size, creatures with multiple legs, or creatures with alternative movement modes like flight. It otherwise operates as a normal hobble.": "这种复杂的蹒跚可以用在任何体型的温顺动物、有多条腿的生物、或有其他运动模式如飞行的生物身上。除此之外，它还能像普通的蹒跚学步一样运作。",

It also makes dangerous-looking animals appear to be safer, meaning bystanders are often less intimidated and more accepting of their presence.": "每种口罩都是为特定类型和尺寸的动物制作的。口罩可以防止佩戴者咬人或吃东西。它还使看起来危险的动物看起来更安全，这意味着旁观者往往不那么害怕，更接受它们的存在。",
	"A muzzle takes one action to apply or remove. At the DM's discretion, this can prevent the handler from having to make Wisdom ({@skill Animal handling}}) checks under some circumstances.": "戴上或取下口罩需要一个动作。根据DM的判断，这可以避免驯服者在某些情况下进行智慧({@skill Animal handling}})检查。",
	"This device consists of two large satchels with a wide connecting strap. They are meant to straddle a Medium or Large mount and hang to either side, just behind a saddle.": "该装置由两个大挎包组成，有一条宽的连接带。它们是为了跨过中型或大型坐骑，挂在两侧，就在马鞍后面。",

	"Exotic saddles are each made for animals of a specific type and size. For example, despite being the same size, a Large dragon's riding saddle cannot be used on a giant seahorse. A military version of an exotic saddle gives the rider advantage on any check or saving throw to remain mounted when the animal is not climbing, flying, or moving underwater. A pack version of an exotic saddle has no accommodation for a rider; it simply provides a frame to which baggage can be tied.": "异国的马鞍都是为特定类型和尺寸的动物制作的。例如，尽管尺寸相同，大龙的马鞍不能用于巨型海马。军用版的异国情调马鞍使骑手在任何检查或蓄力上都有优势，以便在动物不攀爬、不飞行或不在水下移动时保持骑行。包裹版的异国情调马鞍没有为骑手提供住宿，它只是提供了一个框架，可以将行李绑在上面。",
	"Creatures capable of burrowing cannot do so without automatically dismounting their riders, regardless of saddle type. Creatures capable of other three-dimensional movement (climbing, flying, or underwater travel) require strap saddles to keep riders secure. Strap saddles require the rider to use two actions to strap in after mounting, performed by the rider or by aides. Thereafter, the rider cannot be dismounted short of very exceptional circumstances (like the mount burrowing). Using a strap saddle without strapping in is treated as using a riding saddle. The Dungeon Master may impose riding checks every round to stay mounted in cases of climbing, flying, pouncing, and (particularly) underwater travel while not strapped in or while using another type of saddle.": "能够钻洞的生物如果不自动让其骑手下马，就不能这样做，无论马鞍类型如何。能够进行其他三维运动的生物（攀爬、飞行或水下旅行）需要带状马鞍来保证骑手的安全。捆绑式马鞍要求骑手在上马后使用两个动作来捆绑，由骑手或助手来完成。此后，除了非常特殊的情况（如坐骑钻洞），骑手不能下马。使用带状马鞍而不系上马带，则被视为使用马鞍。在攀爬、飞行、扑击和（特别是）水下旅行的情况下，地下城管理员可以每回合进行骑术检查，以便在没有捆绑或使用其他类型的马鞍时保持骑术。",
