	"Welcome back dear reader to another installation of Hamund's Harvesting Handbook. By now I'm sure you've all cut your teeth on the monsters and creatures featured in {@loader Volume I|collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook I.json} of this series and have come back hungry for more. Well you are in luck, because I have spent the interim hunting and harvesting all of the monsters featured in that seminal work; {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM} (written by another man who appreciates the value of good branding) and have prepared yet another catalogue of the natural riches to be found in the creatures around us.": "欢迎回来，亲爱的读者，欢迎来到《哈姆德的收获手册》的另一个装置。现在，我相信你们都已经对这个系列的{@loader Volume I|collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook I.json}中的怪物和生物有所了解，并渴望得到更多。你们很幸运，因为在这段时间里，我花了很多时间去猎取和收获那部开创性作品中的所有怪物；(1%)（由另一个欣赏好的品牌价值的人写的），并准备了另一个目录，在我们周围的生物中找到自然财富。",
	"But wait, there's more! I have brought back secret spells from forgotten lands, filled a list of new items to craft, and even compiled a compendium of the needy people I met on my travels in the hopes that my readers may lend them a helping hand. The book you hold is more than just an instruction manual, it is a veritable travel guide to adventure!": "但是，等等，还有更多！我从被遗忘的土地上带回了秘密的咒语，填写了一份新的物品制作清单。我从被遗忘的土地上带回了秘密的咒语，填写了一份新的物品制作清单，甚至还汇编了我在旅行中遇到的需要帮助的人，希望我的读者可以向他们伸出援手。你手中的这本书不仅仅是一本指导手册，它是一本名副其实的冒险旅行指南",
	"So, indulge yourselves dear readers in the knowledge that I have gained and now pass onto you. Discover how to skin a sea spawn, gut a grung, and debone a devourer (which is quite a difficult feat considering they are almost nothing but bones). Learn how to craft powerful weapons from the spoils of your hunts, as well as wield new magic to aid you in your work. The sky is the limit in our profession, and even the old dogs among you could still stand to learn a few new tricks.": "所以，亲爱的读者们，请尽情享受我所获得的知识，现在传授给你们。了解如何给海产剥皮，给格伦开膛破肚，给吞噬者去骨（考虑到他们几乎除了骨头什么都没有，这是个相当困难的壮举）。学习如何用你的猎物制作强大的武器，以及挥舞新的魔法来帮助你的工作。在我们的职业中，天空是无限的，即使是你们中的老狗也可以学习一些新技巧。",
	"Good luck and good harvesting,": "祝你好运，收获愉快。",
	"Thank you for purchasing the second instalment of the \"Hamund's Harvesting Handbook\" series. This volume covers the monsters included in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}, and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each monster, as well as over 80 new magical items to craft. The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but this book does add a few more interesting pieces to add to your harvesting adventures. Premiering in this book are new NPC merchants for you to pull out on the fly, 6 new spells designed to help harvesters, as well as a job board for every monster in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} and {@book Volo's|VGM} to help DMs make harvesting-based quests on the fly. Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at {@i driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com} or hit me up on Twitter {@link @drifterworkshop|https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop} to discuss anything in this guide.": "感谢您购买《哈姆德的收获手册》系列的第二部。本卷涵盖了{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}中包含的怪物，和以前一样，每个怪物都有完整的收获清单，以及超过80种新的魔法物品制作。收获和制作的规则没有变化，但本书确实增加了一些有趣的内容，以添加到你的收获冒险中。在本书中首次出现的是新的NPC商人，供你即时使用；6个新的法术，旨在帮助收割者；以及{@book Monster Manual|MM}和{@book Volo's|VGM}中每个怪物的工作板，帮助管理员即时制作基于收割的任务。所有的东西都是以平衡为前提的，当然你也可以根据自己的桌子来重新平衡本指南中的任何东西，或者随时给我留言{@i driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com}或在Twitter上给我留言{@link @drifterworkshop|https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop}来讨论本指南中的任何东西。",
	"The act of removing useful body parts from a creature is referred to as {@b harvesting}. Anything that can be harvested from a creature is referred to as a {@b harvesting material} or simply {@b material}. In general, only creatures that have died may be harvested, but there may be some exceptions based on context.": "从一个生物身上切除有用的身体部分的行为被称为（%0%）。任何可以从一个生物身上收获的东西都被称为{@b harvesting material}或简单的{@b material}。一般来说，只有已经死亡的生物可以被收割，但根据情况可能有一些例外。",
	"This section details the steps associated with actually performing a harvest, and any factors that may influence it.": "本节详细介绍了与实际执行收获有关的步骤，以及可能影响收获的任何因素。",
	"Half of a harvester's job is mental, rather than physical. It takes a keen eye, and an analytical mind to fully grasp the nuance of slicing open a fresh kill and reaping the bounty inside. Take your time to evaluate your prize before chopping into it; your wallet will thank me later.": "收割者的工作有一半是精神上的，而不是身体上的。这需要敏锐的眼光和分析能力，才能完全掌握切开一个新鲜的猎物并收获里面的赏金的细微差别。在切开它之前，花点时间评估你的奖品；你的钱包以后会感谢我。",
	"Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt, they may instead choose to take a moment first and {@b appraise} the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested and then roll an Intelligence check, adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to that creature (see table below). For example, when appraising a {@creature banderhobb|VGM} (which is a monstrosity), the check would be an Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, while appraising a {@creature meenlock|VGM} (which is a fey) would require an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.": "在玩家开始砍伐和屠宰他们的猎物之前，他们可以选择先花点时间和{@b appraise}要收获的生物。要做到这一点，他们必须花1分钟来检查要收获的生物，然后掷出智力检查，如果他们精通与该生物相对应的技能，则加上他们的熟练度奖励（见下表）。例如，当鉴定一个(1%)（怪物）时，检查是智力（{@skill Nature}）检查，而鉴定一个{@creature meenlock|VGM}（妖怪）则需要智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查。",
	"The DC of the check is equal to {@b 8 + the Harvested Creature's CR} (treating any CR less than 1 as 0). Success on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement to harvest those materials, any special requirements to harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only attempt one appraisal check per creature.": "检查的DC等于{@b 8 + the Harvested Creature's CR}（将任何小于1的CR视为0）。该检查的成功使玩家完全了解该生物上任何有用的收获材料，收获这些材料的DC要求，收获它们的任何特殊要求，以及这样做的任何潜在风险。此外，该玩家对该生物所做的任何收获检查都是以优势进行的。一个角色对每个生物只能尝试一次评估检查。",
	"Some party members may prefer to let one character handle the appraisal of materials, while another more dextrous character handles the actual harvesting. In this scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred to the player doing the harvesting, so long as the player that performed the appraising assists the harvesting player through the whole duration of the harvest.": "有些党员可能喜欢让一个角色处理材料的鉴定，而另一个更灵活的角色处理实际的收获。在这种情况下，鉴定生物的所有好处都赋予了进行收获的玩家，只要进行鉴定的玩家在整个收获过程中协助收获的玩家。",
	"The thing we've all bought this book to learn: harvesting! Here you will learn the most noble of traditions, dating back to our roots as hunter-gatherers. Read this section well and commit it to memory, for harvesting is the true meat of this book (pardon the pun).": "我们买这本书都是为了学习：收获! 在这里你将学到最崇高的传统，可以追溯到我们作为狩猎采集者的根源。好好读读这一节，把它记在心里，因为收获是本书的真正内容（请原谅我的双关语）。",
	"In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a Dexterity ability check using the same skill proficiency as listed in the above appraising table. For example, a character attempting a harvest check on an Aberration would receive a bonus equal to their Dexterity Modifier and their Proficiency in {@skill Arcana} (if they have any).": "为了收割一个生物，一个角色必须使用与上述鉴定表中所列相同的技能熟练度来进行灵巧能力检查。例如，一个试图对一个畸形人进行收割检查的角色将得到相当于他们的灵巧修饰值和他们的熟练度（%0%）的奖励（如果他们有的话）。",
	"This check reflects a character's ability to not only properly remove the intended item without damaging it, it also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such as proper preservation and storage techniques.": "这个检查反映了一个人物的能力，他不仅能正确地取出预定的物品而不损坏它，它还涉及到收获的任何辅助要求，如适当的保存和储存技术。",
	"If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill proficiency.": "如果玩家在收获某种生物，或者收获某种类型的材料的生物，DM可以允许他们使用相关的工具熟练度而不是技能熟练度。",
	"For example, the DM may allow a player to add their proficiency with {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB} to their attempt to harvest a mechanical golem or use their proficiency with {@item leatherworker's tools|PHB} when attempting to harvest a creature for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may be replaced by proficiency with the {@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}.": "例如，DM可以允许玩家在试图收割一个机械巨兽时加入他们的熟练度（%0%），或者在试图收割一个生物的皮时使用他们的熟练度（%1%）。另外，所有生物类型的熟练度都可以用{@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}的熟练度来代替。",
	"Each individual item in a creature's harvesting table is listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item. Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest a {@creature barghest|VGM} will reward the player with \"barghest blood\", \"barghest fur\" and \"barghest fangs\", but not a \"vial of barghest stomach acid\". If they so wish, players may opt to not harvest a material even if they have met the DC threshold to harvest it.": "在一个生物的收获表中，每个单独的项目都在旁边列出了一个DC。玩家做出的任何等于或超过该DC的卷轴都会给予该玩家该物品。奖励是累积的，玩家可以得到每件DC等于或低于其能力检查结果的物品。例如，在收获一个{@creature barghest|VGM}的检查中滚动总分15分，将奖励玩家 \"最强的血\"、\"最强的毛 \"和 \"最强的獠牙\"，但不是 \"一瓶最强的胃酸\"。如果他们愿意，玩家可以选择不收获某种材料，即使他们已经达到了收获它的DC阈值。",
	"Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature. Failure to meet a certain item's DC threshold assumes that the item was made un-salvageable due to the harvester's incompetence.": "一个生物只能进行一次收割尝试。如果不能达到某项物品的DC阈值，则假定该物品是由于收割者的无能而变得无法挽救的。",
	"For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of that material divided by 5. For huge creatures however, it is equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied by 2.": "对于大多数生物来说，收获一种材料所需的时间是以分钟计算的，并且等于该材料的DC除以5。然而对于巨大的生物来说，它等于该材料的DC，而对于巨大的生物，它等于该材料的DC乘以2。",
	"Large or smaller": "大或小",
	"Material DC / 5": "材料 DC / 5",
	"Material DC": "材料 直流",
	"Gargantuan": "巨大的",
	"Material DC × 2": "材料 DC × 2",
	"It is a shame, but quite understandable, that no one would want to buy a pelt ridden with slash wounds and burn marks. That is why lately, I have taken to wrestling my quarry with my bare hands. It makes for much more pristine carcasses, and much heartier exercise.": "这是一种耻辱，但也可以理解，没有人愿意购买一块布满刀伤和烧伤痕迹的毛皮。这就是为什么最近我开始赤手空拳地与我的猎物搏斗。这样做可以使尸体更纯净，也更能锻炼身体。",
	"This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to harvest died in direct combat and thus already accounts for the idea that you are harvesting creatures that may not be in pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent than others and can make harvesting useful materials either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such examples include burning by fire, dissolving from acid, or being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these cases, raise the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5. Alternatively, the DM may decide that well-orchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for harvesting, such as creatures killed mostly through psychic damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases, the DM should lower the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5.": "本指南假定你试图收获的大多数生物都是在直接战斗中死亡的，因此已经考虑到你收获的生物可能不在原始状态。然而，有些死亡比其他死亡更剧烈，会使收获有用的材料变得非常困难或完全不可能。这些例子包括被火烧，被酸溶解，或者被完全压在石柱下。在这些情况下，将收获该生物的任何材料的DC提高5。另外，DM可能会决定，精心安排的狩猎会产生一个适合收获的尸体，例如那些主要通过精神伤害而被杀死的生物，或者那些在一次干净的攻击中被杀死的生物。在这些情况下，DM应该将收获该生物的任何材料的DC降低5。",
	"Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not some of a creature's individual materials have been made useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of their death. Examples may include blood being tainted from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to excessive slashing/piercing damage.": "此外，DM可以裁定一个生物的某些个别材料是否由于它们在死亡过程中施加的影响而变得无用。例子包括血液因中毒而被污染，或者他们的皮毛因过度砍伐/刺伤而变得毫无价值。",
	"I am aware that in my previous volume, I stated that I was presenting the complete knowledge of harvesting all creatures in the multiverse. While it was true at the time, intrepid explorers other than myself have discovered even more creatures to hunt and harvest. While I am ashamed of misleading my readers, I am humbled by the idea that even I have more to discover and write about in this wonderful lifetime of mine.": "我知道，在我的前一卷中，我说我正在介绍收获多元宇宙中所有生物的完整知识。虽然这在当时是真的，但除我之外的无畏的探险家们已经发现了更多可供狩猎和收获的生物。虽然我为误导我的读者而感到羞愧，但我也很惭愧，在我这美好的一生中，即使是我也有更多的东西需要发现和书写。",
	"Every unique monster from {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM} has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide, and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order they are given in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.": "本书中列出了{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}的每个独特的怪物，并附有相关的收获表。当你的玩家尝试收获时，只需在本指南中查找相关的怪物，并读出结果（怪物的排列顺序与{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}中的顺序相同）。以下是对如何阅读该表的解释。",
	"This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that item.": "这是收获该物品所需的DC。任何等于或超过该阈值的收获检查都允许进行该检查的玩家成功收获该物品。",
	"The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Catoblepas Fur (large pouch) or Barghest Blood (5 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.": "收到的物品的名称。虽然对于大多数物品来说，玩家只收到一个列出的物品，但有些物品名称旁边有括号。这些括号表示玩家在成功收获后获得的数量，例如：。Catoblepas Fur（大袋）或Barghest Blood（5瓶）。然而，根据DM的决定，他们可以裁定玩家获得的数量少于或多于规定的数量。这些原因可能包括在掷骰子时有极高的成功率，或者用某些方法杀死了该生物。",
	"A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a \"{@b Use}\" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.": "对要收获的物品的简要描述，由Hamund撰写。虽然这通常只是为了调味，但有些物品也有一个\"{@b Use} \"部分。这些物品在收获后可以立即使用，不需要进一步调整或制作。它们的功能在这里的描述框中进行了描述。",
	"Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.": "此外，有些材料的收获要求不仅仅是稳定的手和一把锋利的刀。收获材料的任何额外要求或标准都将在这里列出。",
	"All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependant on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as \"varies\" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.": "所有材料都列出了其基本转售价值。这是一个普通店主愿意为条件良好的材料支付的金额。在改变这个价值时，建议管理员酌情考虑，这取决于店主的心情、环境中的稀有程度、材料的状况等等。一个价值为 \"不等 \"的材料表明，它的用途太特殊，不能卖给普通店主，而且材料的价值在很大程度上取决于背景。",
	"When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Barghest Blood is harvested as a set of 5 vials, and so the value listed (1 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Barghest Blood would be worth 5 × 1 gp = 5 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Maw Demon Teeth is harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: \"large bag.\" Thus the 1 gp value listed refers to the value of a \"large bag of Maw Demon Teeth\", not 1 gp for each individual tooth.": "当物品以不连续的数量收获时，列出的价值是指每个单独的物品。例如，Barghest Blood是以5个小瓶的形式收获的，所以列出的价值（1 gp）是指每个小瓶（所以成功收获Barghest Blood的价值是5×1 gp=5 gp）。然而，当物品被列为不连续的数量时，列出的价值是指整个数量。例如，Maw Demon Teeth的收获量是不确定的，即一个。\"大袋\"。因此，列出的1GP值是指 \"一袋大口妖牙 \"的价值，而不是每颗牙齿的1GP。",
	"The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although Devourer Skin may be worth the high price of 2,250 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.": "这里列出的价值是基于无数因素的，包括。怪物的CR，宝藏群的平均价值，在制作过程中的使用，怪物是否倾向于单独被发现，该物品是否是可消耗的，成功收获该物品的概率，围绕现有价格的平衡，有时只是为了增加乐趣。这些价格只是作为一个基线，管理员可以根据他们的活动情况自由调整这些价值。DM还要记住，尽管某些物品可能有很高的价值，但并非所有供应商都想购买它们。例如，尽管吞噬者皮肤可能值2250戈比的高价，但可能很难将它卖给村里的杂货商。有时，为一件神秘的物品寻找合适的买家本身就可以成为一个有趣的副线任务，或者仅仅作为一个很好的休闲活动。",
	"The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.": "所列物品的重量，单位是磅。这里列出的重量遵循与价值相同的规则；列出的数字是指单个项目的重量，除非该项目是以不明确的数量收获的，在这种情况下，重量是指整个不明确的数量。",
	"Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.": "有些物品虽然珍贵，但需要熟练的工匠将其制作成可用的物品。材料的描述详细说明了它们可以被制作成哪种物品。如果这部分是空白的，则该物品没有与之相关的可制作的物品。",
	"The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.": "本书末尾的制作物品部分详细介绍了制作物品的用法，以及它们的制作要求的细节。一些可制作的物品源自WotC出版的源书。这些物品在括号里有特殊的标签，表示它们来自哪本书。",
	"While it is still considered rather ghastly practice to harvest a humanoid, looting their corpses is considered marginally less so. This is good news, especially since I have found that the quality of dropped loot has increased as of late.": "虽然收获一个人形生物仍然被认为是相当可怕的做法，但掠夺他们的尸体却被认为是稍有逊色。这是个好消息，尤其是我发现最近掉落的战利品的质量有所提高。",
	"Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armor. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.": "本书中列出的大多数人形生物并不拥有许多可供收获的有用材料。为了补充人形生物相对较少的表格，在他们的章节中列出了一个单独的表格，描述可以从这些生物身上掠夺的物品。这些物品往往是随机的小玩意，不是武器或盔甲。更多的时候，它们是相对无用的，只打算用来转卖。",
	"There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to largely be used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse. {@b New tables have been provided for humanoids that already appeared in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. The DM is free to choose which table they wish to use.}": "偷窃这些饰品不需要检查能力，而且DM可以自由决定这些饰品中哪些可以在典型的尸体上找到（如果有的话）。这些表格的目的主要是作为DM的灵感，满足渴望掠夺的玩家的欲望，同时避免肢解人形尸体的恶心活动。{@b New tables have been provided for humanoids that already appeared in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. DM可以自由选择他们希望使用的表格。｝",
	"Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.": "与所有收获的物品一样，列出的价值和重量是指该行中各自物品的1个单位。",
	"I remember the first time I encountered a banderhobb. A hag had sent one to kill me because I had trounced her in a game of riddles and took one of her precious jewels as a prize. Now obviously, I prevailed over my hunter, and the only vengeance the hag achieved was that I ended up having to wash banderhobb goo off my clothes for a week afterwards.": "我记得我第一次遇到banderhobb时的情景。一个巫婆派了一个来杀我，因为我在一个谜语游戏中打败了她，并拿了她的一个珍贵的珠宝作为奖品。很明显，我战胜了我的猎人，而巫婆唯一的报复就是我在之后的一个星期里不得不洗掉衣服上的banderhobb粘液。",
	"Neither particularly strong nor smart, a boggle is really more of a nuisance than an actual threat. That said, their oil is particularly useful in harvesting, as the sticky variety works wonders for traps, while the slippery kind is a great knife coating substance for smoother and cleaner cuts. As such, on my travels I often provide boggle removal services free of charge, so long as I am allowed to keep the spoils.": "博格犬既不特别强壮也不聪明，它实际上更像是一种滋扰而不是一种实际的威胁。也就是说，它们的油在收获时特别有用，因为粘稠的品种对陷阱有奇效，而滑溜溜的那种则是一种很好的刀子涂层物质，可以使切割更平滑、更干净。因此，在我的旅行中，我经常免费提供清除boggle的服务，只要允许我保留战利品。",
	"If you are going to hunt a catoblepas, I highly advise you to keep a separate bag for storing the materials. There's nothing worse than having to throw out otherwise perfectly good dragon steaks just because they've been made unpalatable by the stench of the catoblepas fur next to them.": "如果你要猎杀catoblepas，我强烈建议你保留一个单独的袋子来储存材料。没有什么比不得不扔掉本来很好的龙排更糟糕的了，因为它们已经被旁边的catoblepas皮毛的臭味弄得不好吃了。",
	"Where you find one cranium rat, you are bound to find more. In fact, due to their hive mind nature, one cranium rat will instinctually seek out others like it and create a swarm. What I like to do is to leave one cranium rat alive so that it may go seek the rest of its kind, and then sweep in and bag them all at the same time. While this may end up starting a chain of events that leads to an illithid invasion, it's also a very time efficient method of stocking up on harvesting materials.": "在你发现一只颅骨鼠的地方，你一定会发现更多的颅骨鼠。事实上，由于它们的蜂巢性质，一只颅骨鼠会本能地寻找其他同类，并形成一个蜂群。我喜欢做的是让一只颅骨鼠活着，这样它就可以去寻找其他同类，然后同时扫荡，将它们全部收入囊中。虽然这可能会引发一连串的事件，导致幻兽的入侵，但这也是一个非常有效的囤积收获材料的方法。",
	"Unfortunately, a slain darkling is not much use in harvesting as their bodies explode upon their death, releasing the light they have absorbed in one destructive and burning flash. I once had a theory that the light was kept in their torsos, and as such thought that a limb severed while the darkling was still alive would remain stable. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and all I had to show for it was a leg's worth of ash and an understandably irritated darkling.": "不幸的是，被杀的黑灵在收获时没有什么用处，因为它们的身体在死后会爆炸，在一次破坏性的燃烧中释放出它们所吸收的光。我曾经有一个理论，认为光被保存在他们的躯干里，因此认为在黑暗精灵还活着的时候切断的肢体会保持稳定。不幸的是，我错了，我所要展示的只是一条腿的灰烬和一个可以理解的被激怒的黑灵。",
	"It is most unfortunate that a deep scion reverts to its original form upon its death. Not just for harvesting reasons, but it also makes it very hard to explain to a small fishing community why you are standing over their dead mayor with a bloody axe in your hand": "最不幸的是，深层的子孙在死亡后会恢复到原来的形态。不仅仅是为了收获的原因，而且也很难向一个小渔民社区解释为什么你站在他们死去的市长身边，手里拿着一把血淋淋的斧头。",
	"More and more demons just keep popping out the woodwork, and still none of them have the decency to leave a valid carcass unless I slay them on their home plane! I guess that's the reason they say that fiends are responsible for driving mortals insane.": "越来越多的恶魔不断涌现出来，但他们仍然没有一个人有礼貌地留下有效的尸体，除非我在他们的母体上杀了他们！这就是他们说恶魔负责使凡人发疯的原因。我猜这就是他们说恶魔负责使凡人发疯的原因。",
	"Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.": "由于它们的深渊性质，在物质世界被杀的恶魔不能被收割，因为它们的尸体会溶解成一种恶臭的ichor。这种ichor没有任何作用，实际上是无用的。为了正确地收获恶魔，他们必须在深渊中被杀死。",
	"Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below.": "此外，使用从恶魔身上获得的部件也有一定的风险，因为即使他们死后，他们的腐败影响仍然存在。当玩家消耗或调整由恶魔部件制成的物品时，请掷出（%0%）。如果得到10分或更少，该玩家就会因为使用该物品而受到诅咒。该诅咒在该物品的正常效果结束后仍然存在，并且只有在该玩家被{@spell remove curse}法术或类似魔法锁定时才会被移除。如果一个角色被治愈了由调和物品引起的诅咒，他们就不允许再次尝试调和该物品。DM可以自己挑选诅咒，或者在下面的表格中进行滚动。",
	"If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: \"You have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible.\"": "如果诅咒来自于非消耗品，那么诅咒还有一个额外的方面，即：\"你一直需要接触被诅咒的物品，并且不愿意和它分开。\"你一直需要在被诅咒物品的范围内，并且不愿意和它分开。只要有可能，你就觉得需要装备它。\"",
	"It is said that mortals that gaze into the frightening gaze of a babau lose all strength as their courage and will leaves them. I have never once had this problem, and ironically, my sizable collection of babau eyes can attest to that.": "据说，凡是注视着巴保的可怕目光的人都会失去所有的力量，因为他们的勇气和意志都离开了他们。我从来没有遇到过这样的问题，具有讽刺意味的是，我收集的大量巴保的眼睛可以证明这一点。",
	"Despite having the riches of the mountain available to them, firenewts have never amounted to much in terms of having a society, especially when compared to the dwarves. Still, their militaristic nature means that their soldiers are often well equipped, so stripping their pockets can yield greater rewards than stripping their carcasses.": "尽管拥有山中的财富，火牛人在拥有社会方面从未达到什么程度，特别是与矮人相比。不过，他们的军国主义性质意味着他们的士兵往往装备精良，所以扒开他们的口袋可以获得比扒开他们的尸体更大的回报。",
	"The technical term for a froghemoth is actually \"anura maxima.\" The relatively lowbrow name \"froghemoth\" originates from a bardic play called \"Attack of the Froghemoth\", which featured the titular creature as a 50-foot tall, village-crushing force of nature. The play was extremely popular with theatre goers despite its lack of artistic merit, and so the name stuck around and has been used ever since.": "蛙巨兽的技术术语实际上是 \"anura maxima\"。\"青蛙巨兽 \"这个相对低级的名字源于一个名为 \"青蛙巨兽的攻击 \"的吟游诗剧，该剧中的主角是一个50英尺高的自然界中的村庄粉碎者。尽管该剧缺乏艺术价值，但却非常受剧院观众的欢迎，因此这个名字一直存在，并一直沿用至今。",
	"It is often a point of contention among scholars on what is actually the {@homebrew taxonomical|taxological} difference that separates giants and humanoids. After all, in many ways the giants are just large humans (or dwarves or halflings or gnomes, for that matter). In my studies of them however, I have found that a giant's physiology is extremely malleable, allowing them to either alter themselves or be altered by environmental factors much more than the average humanoid. Perhaps this is an added feature of the Ordning, allowing individual giants greater ability to delineate themselves within their caste, or even break free from it altogether. Either way, it makes for an exciting harvesting adventure, since when you cut one open, you can never be exactly sure of what you'll find.": "对于区分巨人和人形动物的（%0%）差异究竟是什么，学者们往往有争议。毕竟，在许多方面，巨人只是大的人类（或矮人或半身人或地精，都是如此）。然而，在我对他们的研究中，我发现巨人的生理机能具有极强的可塑性，使他们比一般的人形生物更容易改变自己或被环境因素所改变。也许这是奥德宁的一个附加功能，让个别巨人有更大的能力在他们的种姓中划分自己，甚至完全摆脱它。不管怎么说，这都是一次令人兴奋的收获冒险，因为当你切开一个，你永远无法确切地确定你会发现什么。",
	"I would advise my readers to beware; it would appear that the gnolls have increased their strength and numbers as of late. However, they still do not have the decency to increase the value of their carcasses. An utter shame, but at least their equipment has gained a bit of variety recently": "我建议我的读者要小心；看来最近地精的力量和数量都有所增加。然而，他们仍然没有提高其尸体的价值。这是个极大的耻辱，但至少他们的装备最近有了一些变化",
	"Before handling a grung, it is recommended that one soaks the carcass in several gallons of fresh water several times. This is not to remove the poison, but just to get rid of the slimy coating which is extremely unpleasant to touch.": "在处理格陵兰之前，建议将其尸体在几加仑的淡水中浸泡几次。这并不是为了清除毒药，而只是为了摆脱粘稠的涂层，因为这种涂层触摸起来非常不舒服。",
	"The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they're dangerous, they're best to be avoided, and they tend to come in threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the dreaded '{@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}.' Great care should always be exercised when carving up one of these ladies, otherwise you run the risk of looking like my childhood nanny for the rest of your life": "女巫的规则与灾难的规则相同：她们很危险，最好避开她们，而且她们往往是三个人一起出现。收割女巫也是一个危险的提议，因为接触她们的体液会有感染可怕的\"（%0%）\"的风险。在雕刻这些女士时，应始终保持极大的谨慎，否则你就有可能在余生中看起来像我的童年保姆。",
	"Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting \"{@disease Crone's Disease|HHHVI}.\" Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become infected with {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI} as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.": "也许反映了他们生前的唾弃天性，女巫即使在死后也会继续显示出无与伦比的报复性水平。在他们死后，女巫的体液中会立即发生反应，使他们成为传播\"（%0%）\"的媒介。每当一个生物吸收了已故巫婆的任何体液，他们必须成功地进行{@dc 15}体质测试，否则就会被感染{@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}。如果一个角色从女巫身上收获的东西失败了，那么当他们笨拙地把血溅到口中或开放的伤口中时，也会有感染（%3%）的风险。",
	"Upon contracting {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell {@spell greater restoration} may return the creature to their normal appearance.": "感染后{@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}，受害者的一个面部特征/身体部位立即转变为更像巫婆的样子。例如，他们的鼻子可能变成钩状，或者他们的手变得像爪子。每隔24小时，受害者可以再次尝试拯救动作。如果成功，疾病就会结束，随后每隔24小时，有一个被转化的特征会恢复正常。如果失败，另一个面部特征或身体部位会变成更像巫婆，并且疾病继续。每隔7天，任何当前转化的特征都会变成永久性的，即使在疾病被治愈之后。在这一点上，只有恢复性的魔法，如咒语（%1%），才能使生物恢复到他们的正常外表。",
	"I've noted in my travels that hobgoblins have become even more dangerous as of late, forming larger armies and fielding more specialised units in battle. While this does pose a danger to civilised society, it does offer a wider range of loot to take from their bodies, so I would say it breaks even.": "在我的旅行中，我注意到，最近霍布林变得更加危险，他们组成了更大的军队，并在战斗中派出了更多的专业部队。虽然这确实给文明社会带来了危险，但它确实提供了更多的战利品，所以我说它是平衡的。",
	"So strong is the ki-rin's compassion for other living creatures, that it can influence their behaviour even after its death. Items crafted from a ki-rin shine with such magnificence that they can inspire even the lowliest of ne'er do-wells to altruism. I have seen this with my own hands when a notorious drinking buddy of mine turned his life around after a mere glance at a bundle of golden ki-rin fur. While I am happy that he has found peace in his life, I do miss having someone to sip whiskey with after a long day's journey.": "麒麟对其他生物的同情心是如此强烈，甚至在它死后还能影响它们的行为。用麒麟制作的物品闪闪发光，即使是最卑微的新人类也能被激发出利他主义。我亲眼看到了这一点，我的一个臭名昭著的酒友在看了一捆金色的麒麟皮毛后，改变了他的生活。虽然我很高兴他在生活中找到了平静，但我确实很怀念在一天漫长的旅程后有一个可以一起喝威士忌的人。",
	"A ki-rin is such a force of good that their body parts are capable of influencing the morality and alignment of those around them. Whenever you consume or finish a long rest attuned to an item made from a material harvested from a ki-rin, you have a {@chance 90|90 percent|Alignment Shift|Your alignment is unchanged|Your alignment shifts to lawful good.} of having your alignment changed to lawful good for the next 24 hours. A {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic will revert you to your original alignment early.": "麒麟是一种善的力量，他们的身体部分能够影响他们周围人的道德和取向。每当你食用或完成一个与从麒麟身上获得的材料制成的物品相适应的长时间休息，你有一个{@chance 90|90 percent|Alignment Shift|Your alignment is unchanged|Your alignment shifts to lawful good.}的机会在接下来的24小时内将你的排列组合改变为合法的好。一个{@spell greater restoration}的法术或类似的魔法会让你提前恢复到你原来的阵线。",
	"Since my last book, I had hoped to be able to say that I had found a specimen of kobold that had managed to impress me. Sadly, this is not the case. Even though I have seen several other races bolster their forces and grow in strength, it seems that kobolds have only grown sillier and more of a parody of themselves. A shame really, since they seem so genetically close to the fiercest creatures in the multiverse: the dragon.": "自从我的上一本书以来，我曾希望能够说，我已经找到了一个成功打动我的哥布林的标本。遗憾的是，情况并非如此。尽管我已经看到其他几个种族加强了他们的力量，实力也在增长，但似乎哥布林只是变得更加愚蠢，更像是对自己的模仿。真的很遗憾，因为他们在基因上似乎很接近多元宇宙中最凶猛的生物：龙。",
	"Once, I very nearly killed a man when I caught him trying to cut off a piece of my beard while I was sleeping. Apparently, the drunken fool had thought that I was a korred and wanted some of my \"magical hair.\" How he could have mistaken a proud dwarf such as myself with an unruly korred, I will never know.": "有一次，我差点杀了一个人，因为我发现他想在我睡觉时剪掉我的一块胡子。显然，这个醉鬼以为我是科瑞德人，想要我的一些 \"神奇的头发\"。他怎么会把我这样一个骄傲的矮人误认为是一个不守规矩的科瑞德人，我永远也不会知道。",
	"One of my baggage handlers went missing once during one of my many jaunts through the Feywild. We found the poor lad a day later, having already succumbed to the torment of a clutch of meenlocks and transformed into one himself. Losing him is one of my greatest regrets in all my travels, and I think of him whenever I pass by his head, which I mounted on my wall in his honour": "我的一个行李员在我多次穿越仙境的旅程中失踪了一次。我们在一天后发现了这个可怜的小伙子，他已经屈服于一窝蛤蟆精的折磨，自己变成了蛤蟆精。失去他是我所有旅行中最大的遗憾之一，每当我经过他的头颅时，我都会想起他，我把他的头颅挂在墙上以示纪念。",
	"A fun tid-bit about myself: an illithid was in fact the first creature that I had ever harvested properly, so curious was I about the inner workings (and valuable organs) of these alien beings. The joy I felt in dissecting an illithid (and the money I made selling off its body parts) is what led me to this lifelong endeavour. So, imagine my joy when I discovered that some illithids had uncovered the secret to lichdom: an ever-replenishing source of illithids to harvest!": "关于我自己的一个有趣的小插曲：事实上，伊利希德人是我曾经正确地收获的第一个生物，我对这些外星生物的内部运作（和宝贵的器官）如此好奇。我在解剖伊里希德时感受到的快乐（以及我卖掉它的身体部位所赚的钱）是导致我终生努力的原因。因此，当我发现一些illithid人发现了lichdom的秘密时，可想而知我的喜悦：一个不断补充的illithid人的收获来源！这就是我的工作。",
	"One of my more embarrassing escapades involved me attempting to research more on the lifestyles and culture of the neogi. To that end I had the admittedly hare-brained scheme of allowing myself to be captured by them so I could observe their society from the inside. While I did manage to get in, their mind-altering psionic powers made me remember very little about my stay afterwards. The most I had to show for it was the organs I had pulled from the guards I killed during my escape, which all things considered, wasn't such a bad result either.": "我的一个比较尴尬的经历是，我试图研究更多关于neogi的生活方式和文化。为此，我有一个公认的大胆计划，就是让自己被他们俘虏，这样我就可以从内部观察他们的社会。虽然我确实设法进去了，但他们改变心智的幻觉能力使我对之后的逗留记忆深刻。我最多只能从我逃跑时杀死的守卫身上提取器官，从所有方面考虑，这也不是一个坏结果。",
	"My mother taught me never to fight a fool, lest you end up looking like one yourself. This holds especially true when facing down a nilbog. The annoying tricksters are so difficult to pin down that even if you do it with your life intact, your dignity most likely won't be.": "我母亲教导我，永远不要和傻瓜打架，以免你自己最后看起来像个傻瓜。在面对尼尔博格的时候，这一点尤其正确。这些恼人的诡计多端的家伙是如此难以对付，以至于即使你能完好无损地完成任务，你的尊严也很可能不保。",
	"Although they may seem like a godless bunch, orcs have a much deeper connection to their pantheon than most other humanoids. Allowing themselves to be irrevocably altered by their deities is a rite of passage amongst them, and while this does make them more dangerous, it also increases the value of their corpses.": "虽然他们看起来像一群无神的人，但兽人与他们的神殿有着比其他大多数人类更深的联系。允许自己被他们的神灵不可逆转地改变是他们的一种仪式，虽然这确实使他们更加危险，但也增加了他们尸体的价值。",
	"As far as I'm aware, a redcap is the only creature that is born fully clothed. As such, it could be asked whether they count as clothes at all, or if they should be considered extensions of their body in the same vein as a creature's hair or nails. I prefer the latter definition as it makes it more justified to harvest them, rather than just \"looting\" them.": "据我所知，红帽是唯一一个生下来就穿戴整齐的生物。因此，我们可以问，它们到底算不算衣服，或者它们是否应该被认为是它们身体的延伸，就像生物的头发或指甲一样。我更喜欢后一种定义，因为它使收获它们变得更加合理，而不仅仅是 \"掠夺 \"它们。",
	"Sea spawn are as varied as the numerous creatures of the depths in terms of biology; however they always seem to carry roughly the same items out of a sense of basic utility. Their bodies aren't worth all that much, and neither are their (often soggy) possessions.": "就生物学而言，海产与深海中的众多生物一样多种多样；但出于基本的实用意识，他们似乎总是携带大致相同的物品。他们的身体并不值钱，他们的（通常是湿漉漉的）财产也不值钱。",
	"Despite some similarities in basic anatomy, tlincalli are in fact not related to centaurs. While centaurs are much closer in taxonomy to humanoids and fey, tlincalli share more with giant insects. As part of this, the magic to be harvested from a tlincalli comes more from its \"natural\" features like its claws and chitin, instead of magically powered organs or blood": "尽管在基本解剖学上有一些相似之处，但特林卡利实际上与半人马没有关系。半人马在分类学上更接近于人形生物和费伊人，而特林卡利则更多地与巨型昆虫分享。作为这一点的一部分，从tlincalli身上获得的魔力更多来自于它的 \"自然 \"特征，如它的爪子和甲壳素，而不是由魔法驱动的器官或血液。",
	"There is some debate as to whether the trapper is related to the infamous dungeon-dwelling cloaker. While it is true that one is a monstrosity and the other an aberration, their similar abilities of illusion and obfuscation, plus the parallels in their internal physiology are not to be ignored. Of course, while it is entirely possible that these are simply the results of convergent evolution, I encourage the research into this line of thinking (especially since it raises the demand from researchers for cloaker and trapper carcasses).": "关于捕猎者是否与臭名昭著的居住在地牢的斗篷人有关，存在一些争议。虽然一个是畸形，另一个是反常，但他们相似的幻觉和混淆能力，以及他们内部生理学的相似之处是不容忽视的。当然，虽然这些完全有可能只是趋同进化的结果，但我鼓励对这一思路的研究（特别是由于它提高了研究人员对斗篷人和捕猎者尸体的需求）。",
	"While not as friendly as their myconid cousins, vegepygmies rarely attack travellers unprovoked. They may even be coaxed into providing shelter when provided with appropriate gifts; something I discovered when I attempted to live among them as research for this book. Unfortunately, their culture was so alien to me that I gained nothing from the experience except for a hacking cough that followed me for several months.": "虽然不像它们的霉菌类表亲那样友好，但vegepygmies很少无故攻击旅行者。如果提供适当的礼物，他们甚至可能被哄骗着提供住所；这是我在为本书做研究时试图在他们中间生活时发现的。不幸的是，他们的文化对我来说是如此的陌生，以至于我没有从这次经历中得到任何好处，除了一个跟随我数月的咳嗽。",
	"For those that may be uneasy about harvesting a creature as innocent and blameless as the wood woad, never fear. After all, I am sure that these protectors of the forest are very much in support of the concept of recycling.": "对于那些可能对收获像木棉这样无辜和无罪的生物感到不安的人来说，不要害怕。毕竟，我确信这些森林的保护者非常支持回收的概念。",
	"Pathetic little creatures are the xvarts, however they do have one redeeming feature for the budding harvester: they are all exactly identical. This makes them fantastic creatures to practice techniques and demonstrate skills on before cutting into more valuable prizes.": "xvarts是一种可悲的小生物，然而它们对于刚起步的收割者来说有一个值得称道的特点：它们都是完全一样的。这使它们成为在切割更有价值的奖品之前练习技术和展示技能的绝佳生物。",
	"I remember when I first started learning the art of harvesting, old master Chien gave me an assignment to dissect a fresh yeth hound he had brought home. I recall him chuckling in the corner as I futilely attempted to cut into it with my scalpel, not realising that the hounds may only be pierced by silver or magical instruments. Apparently, this is a prank he enjoys pulling on all of his students, and he never fails to bring it up whenever I visit him for tea.": "我记得当我刚开始学习收割的艺术时，老钱师傅给了我一个任务，让我解剖他带回来的一只新鲜的叶氏猎犬。我记得他在角落里笑着说，我徒劳地试图用手术刀切开它，没有意识到猎犬只能用银器或魔法工具刺穿。显然，这是他喜欢对他所有的学生进行的恶作剧，每当我去拜访他喝茶时，他都会提到这个问题。",
	"The yeth hound's immunity to non-magical, non-silvered weapons continues into death, and as such, they may only be harvested using silvered or magical tools.": "猎犬对非魔法、非银色武器的免疫力一直持续到死亡，因此，它们只能使用银色或魔法工具进行收割。",
	"Exploring the societies of the yuan-ti has been one of my most troublesome ventures thus far.

	"Despite the rugged independent aesthetic that I exude, I must assure you that harvesting is not a solitary profession! What we do as harvesters is simply the first step in a long chain of commerce and industry, without which, our work would be meaningless. In my career, I have established a long list of faithful contacts and friends that I refer to as my \"Helpers.\" Without them, I would merely be a random man slicing animals open in the wilderness! I pass their information on to you, my dear readers, with my reassurance that their services are second to none. All I ask is that if you find them and engage their services, let them know that Hamund sent you.": "尽管我散发着粗犷的独立美感，但我必须向你保证，收割并不是一个孤独的职业！我们作为收割者所做的只是漫长的商业和工业链中的第一步。我们作为收割者所做的仅仅是商业和工业长链中的第一步，没有这些，我们的工作将毫无意义。在我的职业生涯中，我已经建立了一个长长的忠实联系人和朋友名单，我把他们称为我的 \"帮手\"。没有他们，我将只是一个在荒野中随意切开动物的人！我将他们的信息传递给你们，因为你们是我的朋友。我把他们的信息传递给你，我亲爱的读者，并保证他们的服务是首屈一指的。我所要求的是，如果你找到他们并使用他们的服务，请让他们知道是哈蒙德派你来的。",

Where she got all of these items is yet another mystery, as is the fact that her inventory always seems to have the exact item that you are looking for. Now, as enticing as all that would be, I must highly advise those of you with sticky fingers to behave yourselves around her. After all, if those powerful magical items are the ones she's willing to get rid of, what kind of power do you think she keeps for herself?": "我所知道的是，她的背上背着各种各样的神奇物品，所有这些物品都是由生物制作的，而且都是为了出售。她从哪里得到这些物品是另一个谜，因为她的库存似乎总是有你要找的确切物品。现在，尽管所有这些都很诱人，但我必须强烈建议你们这些手指很粘的人在她身边要注意自己的行为。毕竟，如果那些强大的魔法物品是她愿意扔掉的，你认为她会为自己保留什么样的力量？",

	"Today, Alanna describes her job as being very simple: she gets the right people to talk to each other. In exchange for a small fee, she will get prospective clients in contact with mercenaries willing to do whatever job necessary. For us harvesters, this means a steady supply of work harvesting rare materials for anyone with the coin to pay for it. If you are looking to pick up a little extra spending money, just start asking around for Alanna. She's sure to pop out of the shadows soon enough, with a laundry list of materials for you to find, and all at a premium rate.": "今天，阿兰娜描述她的工作非常简单：她让合适的人互相交谈。作为小额费用的交换，她会让潜在的客户与愿意做任何必要工作的雇佣兵取得联系。对于我们收割者来说，这意味着稳定的工作供应，为任何有硬币支付的人收割稀有材料。如果你想获得一点额外的花销，就开始四处打听阿兰娜。她肯定很快就会从阴影中跳出来，带着一长串的材料让你去找，而且都是以高价出售。",

I recall Orryn being a particularly sensitive boy, often relying on me to fend off bullies and tormentors for him. Still, he was exceptionally bright, taking a keen interest in all sorts of magic and research. As I honed my harvesting skills, he would hone his crafting skills. He would create something wondrous out of the materials I gave him, and it is thanks to him that I am even aware of half the craftables included in this book. No trade is beyond his talents as a polymath, and he is seemingly able to work with anything you give him.": "我和奥林从小就认识，我认为他既是我最亲密的朋友之一，又是最敏锐的头脑之一。我记得奥林是一个特别敏感的男孩，经常依靠我为他抵御欺负和折磨他的人。不过，他还是特别聪明，对各种魔法和研究都有浓厚的兴趣。当我磨练我的收获技能时，他也会磨练他的手工技能。他会用我给他的材料创造出一些奇妙的东西，正是由于他，我甚至知道这本书里有一半的手工艺品。作为一个多面手，没有什么行业是他无法胜任的，而且他似乎能用你给他的任何东西来工作。",

It is rare to find a lizardfolk outside of their swamp villages, and even rarer to find one such as Sellek who seems so comfortable, and perhaps even happy, to live among warm blooded humanoids. I can only conclude that Sellek is at least partially crazy, which is saying a lot when it comes to lizardfolk.": "说实话，我对塞勒克还是有点戒心。在沼泽村外找到蜥蜴人是很罕见的，而像塞勒克这样似乎很舒服，甚至可能很高兴地生活在温血的人类中的蜥蜴人就更罕见了。我只能得出结论，塞勒克至少有一部分是疯狂的，这对蜥蜴人来说是很有意义的。",
	"Despite that, Sellek is one of the finest hunters I have ever seen, bolstered by the high-quality tools that he designed and made himself. Harvesters come from all around, seeking to buy his superior quality traps, bags, and equipment. If there is anything you need for your harvesting adventures, be sure to seek Sellek out for the finest selection of equipment.": "尽管如此，塞勒克是我见过的最好的猎人之一，他自己设计和制造的高质量工具为他提供了支持。收割者来自四面八方，寻求购买他质量上乘的陷阱、袋子和设备。如果你在收获冒险中需要什么，一定要找Sellek购买最好的设备。",

For Rangrim, the choice was easy.": "又有一个霍尔德赫克家族的人被列入我的书中，这次是我的侄子。兰格瑞姆。这个小伙子从来就不是一个容易相处的人；因为他的脾气比他的头发还要火爆。在与部落长老发生无数次分歧和争吵后，最后一根稻草出现了，他被迫在他发现的小熊和他在部落的地位之间做出选择。对Rangrim来说，这个选择很容易。",
	"He now roams the wilds as a hunter and harvester, always followed by his precious bear partner: Lodinn. While he is not quite on the same level of harvesting skill as his dear old uncle, his brash stubbornness seems to have granted him a better head for business. If you spot him in the open or in town, feel free to approach him and barter for harvesting materials. Rangrim never seems to run out of space in his many bags and pouches, and you will find him to be an honest vendor to offer you coin for your excess stock. Be warned though to never cheat him, or you will find out just how well trained Lodinn really is.": "他现在以猎人和收割者的身份在荒野中游荡，身后总是跟着他宝贵的熊伙伴。Lodinn。虽然他的收割技术与他亲爱的老叔叔不太一样，但他的粗鲁固执似乎让他有了更好的生意头脑。如果你在空地上或镇上发现他，可以随时接近他，以收获材料作为交换。兰格瑞姆的许多袋子和包里似乎从来没有用完的空间，你会发现他是一个诚实的小贩，为你多余的库存提供硬币。不过要注意的是，千万不要欺骗他，否则你会发现洛丁真的是训练有素。",
	"I have been an adventurer for as long as I have been a harvester. As part of that, I have met a myriad of people from all over the multiverse, many of whom have asked for my help and expertise on whatever problems may plague them.

Balor ash mixed with saltpetre should do the trick.": "我和孩子们这些天一直在认真地采矿，遇到了一点困难。具体来说，就是一块深渊岩石，即使我们用最强的镐也无法打穿。所以，我在想，如果是深渊岩石，为什么不使用一些深渊炸药？巴洛尔灰与硝石混合，应该能起到作用。",

	"Of all horrors, terrors, and ghastly dangers that have been invented by the demon princes, the devourer's chest is doubtless one of the worst. Imbued with dark magic that draws trapped mortals closer to {@creature Orcus|MTF|Orcus'} domain, the devourer's ribs are a powerful crafting component.

These air sacks may be repurposed for various tools and equipment, including buoyancy aids for ship hulls.": "人们会认为雷龙巨大的脖子无法支撑自己，但令人惊讶的是，它却能做到。更令人惊讶的是，这不是通过魔法而是通过单纯的物理学实现的；雷龙的颈部实际上充满了几个气囊，有助于支撑其颈部并节省重量。这些气囊可以被重新用于各种工具和设备，包括船体的浮力辅助装置。",

	"Stegosaurus Ridge (×4)": "剑龙之脊 (×4)",

	"The sign of a healthy firenewt is a thin layer of mucus on their skin. This mucus smells of sulfur and other minerals that the firenewts come into regular contact with, but serves as a wonderful lubricant and insulation material. Tinkers are often glad to get their hands on samples of this to help maintain their mechanical inventions.": "健康的火牛的标志是它们皮肤上有一层薄薄的粘液。这种粘液散发着硫磺和其他火牛经常接触到的矿物质的气味，但却可以作为一种美妙的润滑剂和绝缘材料。工匠们常常很高兴能得到这种样品，以帮助维护他们的机械发明。",

	"A storm giant quintessent lacks a stable physical form and is instead dispersed into the atmosphere around them, swirling as a literal force of nature. That said, much of their essence can be found distilled into a single mote of weather. Sometimes this takes the form of sparkling rain drops, a breeze that carries a whisper of the giant's name, or a snowflake with a particularly striking pattern. This mote carries much of the original storm giant's power and is thus a good substitute for their physical remains when used in alchemical pursuits. {@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}": "风暴巨人的精髓缺乏稳定的物理形态，而是分散到他们周围的大气中，作为自然界的一种文字力量而旋转着。也就是说，他们的大部分精髓可以被发现提炼成一个单一的天气微尘。有时，它的形式是闪闪发光的雨滴，带着巨人名字的微风，或带有特别引人注目的图案的雪花。这种微尘带有风暴巨人的大部分力量，因此在炼金术中使用时，是他们身体残骸的良好替代品。{@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}",
	"Storm Giant Quintessent Water (vial)": "风暴巨人精水(小瓶)",
	"A storm giant quintessent is capable of forming parts of its own raging storm into weapons for use in combat. To do this, it must impart the ambient atmosphere with the same sense of physicality and stability that it has used on itself to maintain a recognisable giant shape. Once the quintessent is defeated, some of this imparted power remains in their dispersed weapons, which can then be hastily collected for use in powerful alchemy later on. {@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}": "一个风暴巨人的五脏六腑能够将自己的部分狂暴的风暴形成武器，用于战斗。要做到这一点，它必须给周围的大气注入与它自己相同的物理感和稳定性，以保持一个可识别的巨人形状。一旦五色石被打败，这种被赋予的力量有一部分会留在它们分散的武器中，然后可以匆匆收集起来，用于以后的强大炼金术。{@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}",

	"Snow white, thick, yet softer than it looks.

The marks themselves actually do possess a degree of magic that demonologists value as a research material and component.": "为了向他们的恶魔霸主致敬，特别狂热的地精会用受害者的血给自己涂上（%0%）的烙印。这些烙印几乎没有使地精无懈可击的预期效果，但大部分只是由于地精自己的无能。烙印本身实际上拥有一定程度的魔力，恶魔学家将其作为研究材料和组成部分加以重视。",

Needless to say, this product has a very niche market.": "被转化为枯草的地精骨架和其他的骨架是一样的。然而，长期暴露在大自然中会使它们获得一层独特的灰尘，其稠度（和气味）就像极度老化的奶酪。虽然这种灰尘没有明显的魔力，但它非常有用，可用于干燥神秘的墨水，而这些墨水是恶魔般的邪教在涂写他们的黑暗书本和卷轴时使用的。不用说，这种产品有一个非常小众的市场。",
