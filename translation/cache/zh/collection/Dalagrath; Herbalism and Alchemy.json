	"UNLOCKING TRUE POTENTIAL. Rayus Albright was very skilled with plants and oils. He knew how to extract their true power and create almighty concoctions. Many would try and steal these amazing tonics, until the day he started selling his secrets for massive fee. Nowadays, even the most common of townsfolk can put together a simple tonic.": "发掘真正的潜力。雷乌斯-奥尔布赖特对植物和油非常熟练。他知道如何提取它们的真正力量，并创造出全能的混合物。许多人试图偷取这些神奇的补药，直到有一天他开始以大量费用出售他的秘密。如今，即使是最普通的镇民也能调制出简单的补品。",
	"All throughout the world, there are various forms of plant life, ocean products, and even earthy substances that you can utilize both in and out of a combat situation. Herbalism is the profession behind gathering these types of items, and Alchemy is the profession behind extracting their potential and using the products they produce.": "世界各地都有各种形式的植物，海洋产品，甚至是土质物质，你可以在战斗中和战斗外利用它们。草药学是收集这些物品的职业，而炼金术是提取它们的潜力和使用它们产生的产品的职业。",
	"You might find yourself walking through the mountains, only to come across some very rare {@item Primordial Balm|Herbalism&Alchemy}, which under most circumstances can amplify a potion or poison's effects two-fold. At other times, you might find yourself walking across a tundra cold and alone, and due to your training you are able to utilize some {@item Drakus Flower|Herbalism&Alchemy} or {@item Fennel Silk|Herbalism&Alchemy} to help you regulate your body heat.": "你可能会发现自己在山中行走，只是遇到了一些非常罕见的（%0%），在大多数情况下，它可以将药水或毒药的效果放大两倍。在其他时候，你可能会发现自己在寒冷的苔原上独自行走，由于你的训练，你能够利用一些（1%）或（2%）来帮助你调节身体的热量。",
	"While players are out traveling amongst the world, they might want to gather some local flora. This is known as Herbalism. Herbalism is mainly used to gather things like seeds, coral, mushrooms, or bark. It can also be used to gather very potent magical ingredients like ghostly stalks or water infused with the elements.": "当玩家在世界各地旅行时，他们可能想收集一些当地的植物。这就是所谓的草药学。草药学主要用于收集种子、珊瑚、蘑菇或树皮等东西。它也可以用来收集非常有效的魔法成分，如幽灵般的树枝或用元素注入的水。",
	"This action can occur during downtime if the party is out in the wilderness, or it can occur in the middle of the game as the party travels around. This is up to the DM, and they have final say amongst how much you gather and what you gather. This supplement will give a baseline on how to distribute these things.": "这个行动可以发生在停工期间，如果队伍在野外，也可以发生在游戏中间，因为队伍在周围旅行。这由DM决定，他们对你收集多少和收集什么有最终决定权。本附录将给出一个如何分配这些东西的基准线。",
	"There is currently no set Herbalism skill in {@italic 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons}. For purposes of this supplement, the player would use their Wisdom or Intelligence Modifier (whichever is higher) when trying to gather ingredients in this supplement on {@book Appendix A|H&A|1}.": "目前在{@italic 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons}没有设定草药学技能。就本补充资料而言，玩家在{@book Appendix A|H&A|1}上试图收集本补充资料中的成分时，将使用他们的智慧或智力修改器（以较高者为准）。",
	"For example, a Druid with a high Wisdom attribute would be versed at Herbalism due to her experience roaming the wilds for the majority of her life. In the same fashion, a Rogue might have developed a system to survive out in the wilderness by gathering ingredients he was familiar with. Remember, there is no truly wrong way to use Herbalism.": "例如，一个拥有高智慧属性的德鲁伊会精通草药学，因为她一生中大部分时间都在野外游荡。同样地，一个游侠可能已经开发出一套系统，通过收集他熟悉的材料在野外生存。记住，使用草药学没有真正错误的方法。",
	"In between the dungeon delving, the sword slashing and the spell casting, the players usually have a period of rest. Many occasions call for a short or long rest during these times. Gathering plants or herbs is not considered a strenuous activity, and does not interrupt the resting periods that allow movement.": "在深入地下城、砍剑和施法之间，玩家通常有一段休息时间。许多场合都需要在这些时间里进行短暂或长时间的休息。采集植物或草药不被认为是一种剧烈的活动，也不会打断允许移动的休息时间。",
	"For these occasions, a player would announce to their DM that they would like to gather some plant life around the area. The player would then roll a DC 15 Herbalism check. Remember, a player can use a {@item Herbalism Kit|phb} to increase their total modifier by their proficiency bonus if they are proficient with the kit as well.": "在这种情况下，玩家会向他们的管理员宣布，他们想在该地区收集一些植物生物。然后，玩家将掷出一个DC 15的草药学检查。记住，如果玩家也精通这套工具，可以用{@item Herbalism Kit|phb}来增加他们的熟练度奖励的总修正值。",
	"A successful gathering attempt would result in the DM rolling 1d4 for how many ingredients were gathered, and then looking up the parties most relative terrain in {@book Appendix B|H&A|2}. Here the DM would roll for however many ingredients were gained.": "一次成功的采集尝试将导致DM滚动1d4，计算出采集到了多少种成分，然后在{@book Appendix B|H&A|2}中查找各方的最相对地形。在这里，DM将滚动计算获得了多少种成分。",
	"A good general guideline to stick by would be allowing 2-3 gathering moments per session, or 1 to 2 gathering opportunities in between long rests. This will allow the player to craft decent potions and poisons, without giving them unlimited amounts of ingredients.": "一个好的一般指导原则是每节课允许2-3次采集时间，或者在长时间休息之间允许1-2次采集机会。这将使玩家能够制作像样的药水和毒药，而不需要给他们无限量的材料。",
	"While there are no restrictions on who can gather ingredients for Alchemical purposes, some classes or races might have additional advantages. When a player casts a spell similar to locate animals or plants, they gain immediate knowledge on what type of plants are around, and the direction they are in. As a DM, roll against the Terrain Ecosystems tables in {@book Appendix B|H&A|2} (for the closest similar ecosystem) {@dice 1d4} times and let the player know what they would find. Additionally, they gain advantage on Herbalism rolls for those specific plants": "虽然对谁可以为炼金术收集材料没有限制，但一些等级或种族可能有额外的优势。当玩家施展类似于定位动物或植物的法术时，他们会立即获得关于周围有什么类型的植物以及它们所在方向的知识。作为管理人，请在地形生态系统表上滚动（%0%）（对于最接近的类似生态系统）（%1%）次，让玩家知道他们会发现什么。此外，他们在对这些特定的植物进行草药学试验时获得优势。",
	"During periods in between sessions, also known as Downtime, a player can perform Herbalism as well. When a player chooses to use their Downtime activity gathering ingredients, the DM would roll for the player in their stead. If the DM does not know the player's skill scores, the player can decide to either wait to roll at the start of the next session, or have the DM roll {@dice d100} and add 3x Character Level, while trying to beat a 75.": "在两节课之间的时间里，也被称为 \"休息时间\"，玩家也可以进行草药制作。当玩家选择利用闲暇时间收集材料时，DM将代替玩家进行掷骰子。如果管理员不知道玩家的技能分数，玩家可以决定等待在下一次会议开始时再掷骰子，或者让管理员掷骰子（%0%）并加上3倍的角色等级，同时尝试击败75分。",
	"An important thing to keep in mind as the DM, is to not give too many ingredients to the player that decides to gather as a Downtime activity. If given too many ingredients at low levels, the player can then create very powerful potions beyond their level. A good rule of thumb for Downtime gathering, would be to roll once or twice for gathering ingredients per day of travel during downtime, or for every 6 hours in game time if the party isn't going to be traveling.": "作为管理人要记住的一件重要事情是，不要给决定收集的玩家太多的材料，作为闲暇时间的活动。如果在低级别的时候给了太多的材料，那么玩家就可以创造出超出他们水平的非常强大的药水。闲暇时间采集的一个好的经验法则是，在闲暇时间里，每一天的旅行都要进行一次或两次采集原料的卷轴，或者在游戏时间里，如果队伍不打算旅行的话，每6小时进行一次。",
	"A successful gathering check results in the same fashion as if gathering during the session.": "成功的聚集检查的结果与会话中的聚集相同。",
	"After the player has gathered some ingredients, the DM can determine whether or not the character has past experience with it. This can be done either through a quick decision by the DM, or by rolling for the knowledge. If the second option is chosen, the player would perform an Herbalism check at a DC of 10 + DC Difficulty of the ingredient (see below for rare ingredients).": "在玩家收集了一些材料之后，DM可以确定该角色是否有过去的经验。这可以通过DM的快速决定来完成，也可以通过滚动知识来完成。如果选择第二种方法，玩家将进行草药学检查，检查的DC为10+该成分的DC难度（稀有成分见下文）。",
	"If the player fails the roll, the character does not recognize the ingredient enough to understand its purpose. Another attempt can be made after the player has researched more about the ingredient, or has another party member identify it for them. A player cannot roll again for the same ingredient if they do not already know what it is, or have gained insight on it.": "如果玩家失败了，说明这个角色对这个成分的认识还不够深刻，不能理解它的用途。在玩家研究了更多关于该成分的信息之后，或者让其他成员为其辨认，可以再次进行尝试。如果玩家不知道它是什么，或者已经对它有了深入的了解，就不能再为同一种成分掷骰子。",
	"The world is a bountiful place amongst all of the terrains it has within itself. While there are some plants that only grow in certain regions, and others that grow almost everywhere, you might come across a rare ingredient or two. These ingredients are marked as such for the DM to easily recognize them.": "在它所拥有的所有地形中，世界是一个富饶的地方。虽然有些植物只生长在某些地区，而有些植物几乎到处都有，但你可能会遇到一两种罕见的成分。这些成分被标记为这样的成分，以便管理员能够轻松地识别它们。",
	"Rare ingredients such as the {@item Primordial Balm|Herbalism&Alchemy} offer major boons to both potions and poisons. Therefore they are much harder to identify the exact details of. The player would perform a regular Herbalism check as described above, but would add an additional +3 to the DC.": "罕见的成分，如{@item Primordial Balm|Herbalism&Alchemy}，对药水和毒药都有重大好处。因此，它们的具体细节更难确定。玩家将按照上述方法进行常规的草药学检查，但会在DC上增加一个额外的+3。",
	"Just as the DC gets increased, the detailed knowledge gap does as well. If the player surpasses the roll by 10 instead of the normal 5, the character knows detailed information about that ingredient.": "就像DC被增加一样，详细的知识差距也会被增加。如果玩家在掷骰子的时候超过了10，而不是正常的5，那么这个角色就知道关于这个成分的详细信息。",
	"Herbs and common Plants are often sold in cities, towns, and even sometimes villages. This can be done either during Downtime or in session, and operates the same regardless. However, depending on how the economy of the world your in is about, the prices and quantities of said items could be at any end of the spectrum.": "草药和普通植物通常在城市、城镇，甚至有时在村庄出售。这可以在闲暇时间或会议期间进行，并且无论如何都是一样的操作。然而，根据你所在的世界的经济情况，上述物品的价格和数量可能在光谱的任何一端。",
	"Don't expect to walk into the town of Willsbury, which recently was ransacked by Orcs, and hope to sell your ingredients at full price, or even at all! Sometimes you can get lucky and unload all your unwanted ingredients in a capital city in need of fresh herbs, and other times you'll be holding onto stuff for awhile.": "不要指望走进最近被半兽人洗劫一空的威尔斯伯里镇，并希望以全价出售你的原料，甚至根本不卖！有时你会很幸运，在需要新鲜草药的首都城市卸下你所有的原料。有时你会很幸运，在一个需要新鲜草药的首都卸下你所有不需要的原料，而其他时候，你将会持有一段时间的东西。",
	"Under normal everyday circumstances, a player can expect to sell a handful or two of common ingredients to a merchant in a city or town. However, the amount of money for those herbs will still vary vastly. Rare ingredients are very hard to sell at full price, and even harder to find a buyer for.": "在正常的日常情况下，玩家可以期望将一两手普通的原料卖给一个城市或城镇的商人。然而，这些草药的金额仍然会有很大的不同。稀有的原料很难以全价出售，更难找到买家。",
	"Just like selling Magic Items, the player will need to perform a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find potential buyers of their products. Another player in the party can assist in this venture by offering their services, granting the original player advantage on this roll.": "就像销售魔法物品一样，玩家需要进行DC20智力（调查）检查来寻找他们产品的潜在买家。派对中的另一名玩家可以通过提供服务来协助这项冒险，使原来的玩家在这项测试中获得优势。",
	"On a failure, no buyer can be found until the player performs a long rest and attempts again. On a success, the player is able to find a buyer in a nearby area to them immediately. If this was done during downtime, it takes a number of days equal to the rarity of the ingredient. Also, the rarity of the ingredient you are trying to sell might affect the chance that the price will not be near full price for that particular ingredient. Consult the tables below for both the prices offered by a potential buyer, as well as the amount of days it would take during downtime to find one.": "失败时，无法找到买家，直到玩家进行长时间的休息并再次尝试。如果成功，玩家可以立即在附近地区找到一个买家。如果这是在停工期间进行的，那么需要的天数就等于原料的稀有程度。另外，你要出售的原料的稀有程度可能会影响到该原料的价格不会接近全价的机会。请参考下面的表格，了解潜在买家提供的价格，以及在停工期间需要多少天才能找到买家。",

	"A buyer offering to purchase all of your ingredients at once at half price": "买家提出以半价一次性购买你所有的原料",
	"A shady buyer who is willing to buy all of your ingredients at full price, no questions asked": "一个阴暗的买家，愿意全价购买你的所有原料，不问任何问题。",
	"Once the player has found a successful buyer for an ingredient, the DM can determine the identity of the buyer if they wish. If the buyer seems shady or likely to get the party into trouble down the road, feel free to skip selling the items to that buyer and try again later.": "一旦玩家为某种原料找到了成功的买家，如果他们愿意，DM可以确定买家的身份。如果这个买家看起来很可疑，或者有可能给玩家带来麻烦，那么可以跳过将物品卖给这个买家，以后再试。",
	"Finally, we have some ingredients from the wild. Maybe you even got lucky or had a generous DM that gave you something cool. But we can't just stuff the ingredients in our mouth and hope for the best now, can we? You'll need an understanding on how to extract their power, which is known as Alchemy.": "最后，我们有一些来自野外的成分。也许你甚至很幸运，或者有一个慷慨的DM，给你一些很酷的东西。但我们现在不能只是把原料塞进嘴里，希望得到最好的结果，不是吗？你需要了解如何提取它们的力量，这就是所谓的炼金术。",
	"Just like Herbalism, a player can perform Alchemy either in session or during a period of Downtime. All a player would have to do is declare they want to perform Alchemy with a few ingredients. The mechanics for both in session and downtime are the same.": "就像草药学一样，玩家可以在会议中或在休会期间进行炼金术。玩家所要做的就是声明他们想用一些材料进行炼金术。会期和休眠期的机制都是一样的。",
	"Just like Herbalism, there is currently no set Alchemy skill in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. Towards that purpose, a character would use their Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, whichever is highest, and then add their proficiency bonus if they are proficient with either an herbalism kit or alchemist's supplies.": "就像草药学一样，第五版龙与地下城中目前也没有设定炼金术技能。为了达到这个目的，一个角色将使用他们的智力或智慧修饰，以最高者为准，然后加上他们的熟练度奖励，如果他们精通草药包或炼金术士的用品。",
	"For example, the Druid from the prior Herbalism example would be able to use her connection to nature to deduce how to best combine ingredients in a safe manner from having to do so growing up. At the same time, that Rogue from the prior Herbalism skill example might have studied medicine in his lifetime, in order to understand the body and create better poisons. Both are viable background and flavor texts for Alchemy.": "例如，先前的草药学例子中的德鲁伊能够利用她与自然的联系来推断出如何以安全的方式最好地组合成分，因为她在成长过程中曾这样做过。同时，之前的草药学技能例子中的游侠可能在生前学习过医学，以便了解身体并创造更好的毒药。两者都是可行的背景和炼金术的风味文本。",
	"When a player would like to craft a potion or poison, they would announce it to their DM. Players can perform {@italic Alchemy Attempts}, which are the equivalent to {@italic Rituals}. This process takes 10 minutes to complete and results in a single vial of paste, powder, or liquid.": "当玩家想制作药水或毒药时，他们会向他们的管理员宣布。玩家可以进行（%0%），相当于（%1%）。这个过程需要10分钟来完成，结果是一小瓶浆糊、粉末或液体。",
	"For each type of concoction, the player is required to have a tool. Crafting potions and tonics requires some {@item Alchemist's Supplies|phb} or {@item Herbalism Kit|phb}, while crafting poisons requires a {@item Poisoner's Kit|phb}. The player does not need to be proficient with the tools in order to craft the items, but being proficient with these tools adds their proficiency bonus again to their rolls in crafting.": "对于每种类型的炼药，玩家都需要有一个工具。炼制药水和补药需要一些（%0%）或（%1%），而炼制毒药需要（%2%）。玩家不需要精通这些工具就可以制作物品，但是精通这些工具会在他们制作物品的过程中再次增加他们的熟练度奖励。",
	"To start a basic Alchemy Attempt, you would select a base ingredient to work with. Base ingredients have the term {@bold {@italic Effect}} in front of the description. When crafting, you can only have one of these base ingredients unless an ingredient says otherwise, such as {@item Bloodgrass|Herbalism&Alchemy}.": "要开始一个基本的炼金尝试，你要选择一个基本的原料来工作。基本原料的描述前面有一个术语{@bold {@italic Effect}}。炼制时，你只能有一种基本原料，除非原料另有说明，如{@item Bloodgrass|Herbalism&Alchemy}。",
	"Once you have your base ingredient, you can add other ingredients that have the {@bold {@italic Potion Modifier}}, {@bold {@italic Toxin Modifier}} or {@bold {@italic Special}} term in front of the description. You can only have one Effect ingredient and up to three Modifier ingredients in a single concoction. Secondly, there are {@bold {@italic Enchantment}} ingredients.

	"On a successful Alchemy Attempt roll, you create the vial of paste, powder, or liquid. On a failure, the vial's contents don't look exactly like they should. It is up to the DM to decide whether the character knows if the potion will work correctly.": "炼金术尝试成功后，你会创造出小瓶的浆糊、粉末或液体。失败时，小瓶的内容物看起来并不完全像它们应该有的样子。由DM决定角色是否知道药水是否能正常工作。",

	"A simple {@bold {@italic Effect}} potion normally is either a healing-like substance, while {@bold {@italic Enchantment}} potions produce a spell-like effect.

While the healing-like substances can be altered by {@bold {@italic Potion Modifier}} ingredients, all of the {@bold {@italic Enchantment}} potions cannot.": "简单的{@bold {@italic Effect}}药水通常是类似治疗的物质，而{@bold {@italic Enchantment}}药水产生类似法术的效果。例如，{@item Wisp Stalks|Herbalism&Alchemy}}产生的效果是让药水的使用者在1小时内变成隐形人。虽然类似治疗的物质可以被{@bold {@italic Potion Modifier}}成分改变，但所有的{@bold {@italic Enchantment}}药水都不能。",

	"Due to the nature of Legendary magic items, it is impossible to create them using normal Alchemy means. If your DM so wishes, you could embark on a quest to find an ancient Alchemy Set that can then craft these potions. However, the DM would have to homebrew these recipes.": "由于传奇魔法物品的性质，不可能用普通的炼金术手段来制造它们。如果你的管理员愿意，你可以去寻找一套古老的炼金术，然后制作这些药水。但是，DM必须自制这些配方。",
	"One of the main tools in an assassin, Drow, or evil being's repertoire of ways to kill someone. Poisons. Most of the time these are beautiful, and all of the time they are deadly.

	"Poisons are very versatile in how one can create them. They can target the target's core and disrupt their body heat overtime to freeze them from the inside-out, or even decide to boil their flesh off using acidic properties. They can knock-out targets as well as make targets unaware they are even poisoned. When an alchemist creates a poison, they decide whether the poison needs to be {@bold {@italic inhaled}}, {@bold {@italic ingested}}, dealt with an {@bold {@italic injury}}, or just making {@bold {@italic contact}} with skin.": "毒药的用途非常广泛，人们可以创造它们。它们可以针对目标的核心，破坏他们的体温，使他们从内到外冻结，或者甚至决定用酸性物质把他们的肉煮掉。他们可以击倒目标，也可以让目标不知道他们甚至被毒死。当一个炼金术士创造一种毒药时，他们决定这种毒药是否需要{@bold {@italic inhaled}}，{@bold {@italic ingested}}，用{@bold {@italic injury}}处理，或者只是用皮肤做{@bold {@italic contact}}。",
	"Luckily, for all those wanting to master the art of poisons, all they need to start is a very common ingredient called {@item Wyrmtongue Petals|Herbalism&Alchemy}.
