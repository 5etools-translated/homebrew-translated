{
	"Greetings, dear reader, and welcome to the {@i Mimic Book of Mimics}. In this tome, I have compiled all manner of mimicry and chameleonism belonging to the apex ambush predator of dungeons: the humble mimic. In its pages, you can find all which is known of mimickind to the realms of science, from its diet, to its hunting tactics, to its idiosyncrasies.": "亲爱的读者，你好，欢迎来到{@i Mimic Book of Mimics}。在这本小册子中，我汇编了属于地下城的顶级伏击掠夺者：卑微的模仿者的各种方式的模仿和变色龙行为。在这本书中，你可以找到科学领域中所有关于拟态的知识，从它的饮食，到它的狩猎策略，到它的特异功能。",
	"Sadly, the anatomy and ecology of the common mimic are not yet widely understood. Many people do not know, for example, if the mechanism of the mimic's infamous shapeshifting is more akin to the transforming curse of lycanthropy, or the rigid-yet-oozelike humors of the gelatinous cube. Therefore, through countless hours of research, I have not only derived answers to these long unanswered questions, I have also uncovered numerous varieties of the common mimic, which hunt in elaborate and prices ways. To this book, I dedicate all this knowledge, for the betterment of scientific endeavour.": "可悲的是，人们对普通拟态的解剖学和生态学还没有广泛的了解。例如，许多人不知道模仿者臭名昭著的变身机制是更类似于狼人的变身诅咒，还是凝胶状立方体的僵硬而又愚蠢的幽默。因此，通过无数个小时的研究，我不仅得出了这些长期未解答的问题的答案，还发现了普通拟态的众多品种，它们以精心设计的方式进行狩猎。在这本书中，我把所有这些知识奉献给了科学事业的发展。",
	"There are detractors, however, who would claim that this book is nothing more than a mimic in disguise, waiting for you to lower your guard for even a moment to strike down upon your delectable hands. I cannot stress this enough: this book is not secretly a mimic, just as I—Guyle Notasham—am not a literary device employed by said mimic to make the illusion that much more complete.": "然而，也有反对者声称，这本书只不过是一个伪装的模仿者，等着你放松警惕，哪怕是片刻，就会对你的美味双手下手。我怎么强调都不为过：这本书并不是秘密的模仿者，就像我--盖尔-诺塔沙姆--并不是上述模仿者为使幻觉更完整而采用的文学手段。",
	"Enjoy this book, and may fortune smile upon you, for a mimic may lurk anywhere, even where you least expect it!": "请欣赏这本书，愿幸运之神向你微笑，因为模仿者可能潜伏在任何地方，甚至在你最不期望的地方。",
	"Few monsters are as emblematic to dungeon delving as the mimic. As a fluid shapeshifter, capable of replicating any dungeon fixture, the mimic is as much a part of dungeon architecture as it is dungeon ecology. Experienced adventures know that literally anything could be a mimic, but in accordance with the unspoken laws of dungeoneering, mimics only show up at the least convenient moment possible. Most often, this is when the party is exhausted and ready to claim whatever rewards hide in an old wooden chest.": "很少有怪物能像模仿者一样成为地下城探索的象征。作为一个流动的变形体，它能够复制任何地下城的设施，模仿者是地下城建筑的一部分，也是地下城生态学的一部分。有经验的冒险家知道，从字面上看，任何东西都可以成为模仿者，但根据地牢工程的潜规则，模仿者只会在最不方便的时候出现。最常见的情况是，当一行人筋疲力尽，准备领取藏在一个旧木箱里的任何奖励时。",
	"But mimics can be more than chests filled with treasure! They come in all shapes and sizes, from the diminutive {@creature mock|mimicbook} to the gargantuan {@creature bluff|mimicbook}. They can replicate treasure ranging from a single gold piece, to a painting, to a shiny new sword, and they can even pretend to be people, on occasion. Mimics should never be underestimated.": "但模仿者可不仅仅是装满财宝的箱子！他们有各种形状，从最小的（%0）到巨大的（%1%）。它们有各种形状和大小，从微小的（%0%）到巨大的（%1%）。他们可以复制宝物，从一块金币到一幅画，再到一把闪亮的新剑，他们甚至可以假装成人，有时。模仿者永远不应该被低估。",
	"Prepared adventurers should memorize this tome, the {@i Mimic Book of Mimics} (which is incidentally, not a mimic), to understand their mimic foes, before a mimic mimics what's least expected to be mimicked.": "有准备的冒险者应该记住这本小册子，即（%0%）（顺便说一下，这不是一个模仿者），以了解他们的模仿者的敌人，在模仿者模仿最不希望被模仿的东西之前。",
	"Dungeon ecosystems produce some of the most astonishing creatures on the planet, which in turn become integral parts of their remarkable environment. Each dungeon denizen, from {@creature rust monster|mm|rust monsters} to {@creature blink dog|mm|blink dogs}, has their own unique biology, diet, and life cycle, which defines them among their peers. Mimics are no exception; as some of the strangest monstrosities native to dungeons, they live truly bizarre lives.": "地牢生态系统产生了一些地球上最令人惊讶的生物，而这些生物又成为其卓越环境的组成部分。每个地牢居民，从{@creature rust monster|mm|rust monsters}到{@creature blink dog|mm|blink dogs}，都有自己独特的生物、饮食和生命周期，这使他们在同龄人中脱颖而出。模仿者也不例外；作为地牢中最奇怪的怪兽，它们的生活确实很奇怪。",
	"The mimic earns its name from its uncanny ability to not only alter the shape and color of its body, but the texture of its skin as well. In an instant, a mimic can contort its entire form to perfect replicate an inanimate object, only to remain motionless for hours, if not days. Few limitations hinder mimic transformation, as long as the intended form possesses the same volume as the mimic itself, and has no complex moving components.": "模仿者的名字来自于其不可思议的能力，不仅可以改变其身体的形状和颜色，还可以改变其皮肤的纹理。在一瞬间，模仿者可以扭曲它的整个形态，完美地复制一个无生命的物体，只是在几个小时甚至几天内保持不动。几乎没有什么限制会阻碍模仿者的转变，只要预期的形式拥有与模仿者本身相同的体积，并且没有复杂的移动部件。",
	"These uncanny changes owe largely to a special layer in the mimic's skin, containing innumerable, microscopic pigmentation organs. These organs are responsible for pumping pigment to the skin's surface to be seen, for drawing pigment deeper into the body to hide it, and also for producing new pigmentation compounds to match materials found in the environment. The mimic's skin even possesses a rudimentary memory, allowing it to rapidly reshape its form into commonly assumed colors and textures once disturbed.": "这些不可思议的变化在很大程度上归功于模仿者皮肤中的一个特殊层，它包含了无数的、微小的色素器官。这些器官负责将色素输送到皮肤表面以便被看到，将色素引到身体深处以便隐藏起来，还负责生产新的色素化合物以配合环境中的材料。模仿者的皮肤甚至拥有基本的记忆，一旦受到干扰，它可以迅速将自己的形状重塑为通常认为的颜色和质地。",
	"Once a mimic's skin is transformed, it remains that way passively, requiring no internal energy until the mimic transforms again. Because of this, {@homebrew no one|nooone} has ever seen a mimic in a fully un-transformed state—their amorphous state still resembling a melted or distorted object. Even after death, the limp, pliant body of a mimic retains its color and texture.": "一旦模仿者的皮肤被转化，它就会被动地保持这种状态，不需要内部能量，直到模仿者再次转化。正因为如此，{@homebrew no one|nooone}曾见过完全未转化状态的模仿者--他们的无定形状态仍像一个融化或扭曲的物体。即使在死后，模仿者的软弱无力的身体也能保持其颜色和质地。",
	"Moreover, a mimic's anatomy is fundamentally fluid. Though mimics are not internally homogenous (as oozes are), mimics possess malleable organs, which seem akin to putty when examined post-mortem. Most of these organs operate on fundamentally unexplained mechanisms. Some strengthen to grant rigidity to the mimic's frame for extended transformations, others digest prey, and others still transform into the mimic's characteristic eyespots, teeth, and purple, acidic surfaces.": "此外，模仿者的解剖结构从根本上说是流动的。虽然模仿者的内部并不均匀（就像渗出物一样），但模仿者拥有可塑性强的器官，在死后检查时似乎类似于油泥。这些器官中的大多数在根本上无法解释的机制上运作。有些加强了模仿体框架的硬度，以便进行长时间的转变，有些消化猎物，有些则转变为模仿体特有的眼点、牙齿和紫色的酸性表面。",
	"Mimics have evolved to assume the façade of whatever furnishings naturally exist in their hunting grounds, and gravitate toward forms which attract prey. Most adventurers assume this means mimics will always disguise themselves as treasure, but mimics are just as likely to take the form of archways, sconces, doors, and staircases. Such forms are akin to a snake stalking a well-trafficked game trail: prey walks by often, and are likely to ignore small details on their commute.": "模仿者已经进化到可以伪装成他们狩猎场上自然存在的任何家具的外观，并倾向于吸引猎物的形式。大多数冒险者认为这意味着模仿者总是将自己伪装成宝藏，但模仿者也同样可能采取拱门、壁炉、门和楼梯的形式。这样的形式就像蛇在跟踪一条精心铺设的游戏小径：猎物经常走过，很可能会忽略他们通勤时的小细节。",
	"Mimics are nothing if not patient. The more intelligent of the species will slumber inanimate until their prey is alone or vulnerable, whereas the more aggressive will simply linger until their prey wanders within reach. But be warned: less trafficked dungeons always have hungrier, more aggressive mimics.": "模仿者如果没有耐心，那就什么都不是。聪明的模仿者会在猎物孤独或易受伤害之前一直沉睡不醒，而更具攻击性的模仿者则会一直徘徊，直到猎物徘徊在他们的视野之内。但请注意：人迹罕至的地牢总是有更饥饿、更具攻击性的模仿者。",
	"When a mimic finally reveals itself, it bears its teeth and pseudopods, ensnaring and ripping into prey that have drawn too close. To the unprepared, a mimic ambush is a death-sentence, for it's nigh impossible to squirm away from the mimic's adhesive skin before its teeth deliver a lethal blow. In a perfect kill, after a momentary struggle, a mimic leaves only shoes behind where a person once stood. Of course, with a weapon at hand and vigilant allies, most anyone can stand a fighting chance.": "当模仿者最终显露身形时，它就会露出牙齿和假肢，抓住并撕咬过于靠近的猎物。对于没有准备的人来说，模仿者的伏击是一种死亡判决，因为在模仿者的牙齿发出致命一击之前，几乎不可能从模仿者的粘性皮肤中挣脱出来。在一次完美的杀戮中，经过短暂的挣扎，模仿者在人曾经站过的地方只留下鞋子。当然，如果有武器在手，又有警觉的盟友，大多数人都可以有机会战斗。",
	"Unless starving, a mimic will always retreat before being slain. Wary adventurers should make every effort to slay a fleeing mimic before it escapes from view, for once it gets out of sight, a deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues. The injured mimic could be anywhere or anything, and it knows to be cleverer each time it stages an ambush. The adventurers are more suspicious of each object that seems out of place. Perhaps the mimic assumes the form of an uncommon object, or perhaps that's just what the adventurers will expect next!": "除非饿死，否则在被杀死之前，拟态总是会撤退的。警惕的冒险者应该尽一切努力，在逃跑的模仿者逃出视线之前将其杀死，因为一旦它逃出视线，一场致命的猫捉老鼠的游戏就随之而来。受伤的模仿者可能在任何地方或任何东西上，而且它知道每次伏击都会更聪明。冒险家们对每一个看起来不合适的物体都更加怀疑。也许模仿者会以一种不常见的物体的形式出现，也许这就是冒险家们接下来要期待的东西!",
	"{@comic Editor's note: Halflings are a particular delicacy to mimics.": "{@漫画编辑注：半身人是模仿者的一种特殊美味。",
	"Though common knowledge attests that mimics exclusively dine on adventures, this could not be further from the truth. Adventurers are too few and far between—and too many are already eaten by dragons each year—to be a sustainable food supply. Indeed, mimics mainly subsist on other dungeon delvers. {@creature goblin|mm|Goblins}, {@creature kobold|mm|kobolds}, {@creature drow}, {@creature giant rat|mm|giant rats}, {@creature grimlock|mm|grimlocks}, {@creature lizardfolk}, and {@creature rust monster|mm|rust monsters} are all on the menu, while the occasional unwary {@creature bat} will make a fine snack. Mimics are simply not picky about food, but will always prefer a larger humanoid meal.": "虽然常识证明，模仿者只吃冒险者，但这与事实相去甚远。冒险者太少了，而且每年都有太多的冒险者被龙吃掉了，因此不能成为可持续的食物供应。事实上，模仿者主要以其他地下城探险者为生。{@creature goblin|mm|Goblins}、{@creature kobold|mm|kobolds}、{@creature drow}、{@creature giant rat|mm|giant rats}、{@creature grimlock|mm|grimlocks}、{@creature lizardfolk}和{@creature rust monster|mm|rust monsters}都是菜单上的食物，而偶尔不警惕的{@creature bat}会成为精美的小吃。模仿者对食物根本不挑剔，但总是喜欢吃较大的人形食物。",
	"Mimics digest their food slowly and excrete their bones far from where they hunt, so as to deter suspicion. Moreover, mimics don't tarry long after making a kill, for the blood and refuse are dead giveaway to other possible prey.": "模仿者消化食物的速度很慢，并在远离猎物的地方排泄骨头，以阻止人们的怀疑。此外，模仿者在杀戮后不会耽搁太久，因为血迹和垃圾会给其他可能的猎物带来致命的威胁。",
	"All mimics, regardless of subspecies, reproduce by fission: when a mimic grows large enough and has a surplus of food, it asexually divides into two independent mimics. Ooze research has done much to enlighten the mechanism behind this process, but it still possesses a handful of enigmas.": "所有的拟态动物，无论哪个亚种，都是通过裂变来繁殖的：当一个拟态动物长得足够大，并且有多余的食物时，它就会无性地分裂成两个独立的拟态动物。敖包研究已经做了很多工作来阐明这一过程背后的机制，但它仍然拥有一些谜团。",
	"The largest and most perplexing of these is the supposed \"prime\" mimic form, the shape assumed by new mimics the moment they are birthed. Natural philosophers assume that mimics, like all other shapeshifters, have a natural un-transformed form, which is assumed by them only in the moments before they assume their first object form. From that moment onward, they shift between analogs of objects, and never fully revert to this hypothetical state. Sadly, reproduction of captive mimics has never been observed, so the question of this \"prime\" mimic form for now remains unverified.": "其中最大和最令人困惑的是所谓的 \"原始 \"拟态形态，即新的拟态者在出生的那一刻所承担的形状。自然哲学家认为，模仿者，像所有其他变形者一样，有一个自然的未变形的形态，这个形态只在他们承担第一个物体形态之前的时刻被他们承担。从那一刻起，他们在物体的类似物之间转换，并且永远不会完全恢复到这种假想的状态。可悲的是，从来没有人观察到圈养的模仿者的繁殖，所以这种 \"主要 \"模仿形式的问题目前仍未得到证实。",
	"{@comic Editor's Note: It's possible mimics are always transformed, breaking off of their parent as one breaks the leg off a chair.": "{@漫画编辑注：有可能模仿者总是被改造，从他们的父母身上脱离，就像人们从椅子上折断腿一样。",
	"Innumerable histories trace the mimic's origin to a lesser-known wizard, mad tyrant, or sorcerer-king, who constructed the creature from vile magics long ago. Upon close investigation, however, it would seem that all these stories are apocryphal, for they all derive from a single source. The original text did not even cite their origins, but instead drew metaphor to a mythological figure, Ahad the Mad (a demigod who crafted furniture from his worshippers), to explain their remarkable powers over shapeshifting. Later histories embellished this reference into entire fictional kingdoms and wars to explain the mimic's origins and a mage's intervention. Thus, with this amateur historian's extensive efforts, we are now no closer to understanding the mimic's origins!": "无数的历史追溯到模仿者的起源是一个不太知名的巫师、疯狂的暴君或巫师王，他在很久以前用卑鄙的魔法建造了这个生物。然而，经过仔细调查，似乎所有这些故事都是伪造的，因为它们都来自一个单一的来源。原始文本甚至没有引用它们的起源，而是以一个神话人物--疯狂的阿哈德（一个从崇拜者身上制作家具的半神）为隐喻，来解释它们对变形的非凡能力。后来的历史将这种提法美化为整个虚构的王国和战争，以解释模仿者的起源和法师的干预。因此，在这位业余历史学家的广泛努力下，我们现在离了解模仿者的起源已经不远了!",
	"You would be justified, then, in asking from whence these monstrosities arise. Such a unique creature, after all, ought to have a unique history. Mimics are an age-old monstrosity, but don't trace their ancestry to the dawn of time. Indeed, the earliest histories describe relatively simpler transformations and fewer varieties of the creature.": "那么，你就有理由问，这些怪胎是从哪里来的。这样一种独特的生物，毕竟应该有一个独特的历史。模仿者是一种古老的怪胎，但并不能将其祖先追溯到时间的黎明。事实上，最早的历史描述了相对简单的转变和较少的生物品种。",
	"Therefore, I believe there are a few strong possibilities for the mimic's origin. I begrudgingly accept that it's possible a defective {@spell polymorph} spell might have distorted a magical creature into the first mimic, but such tampering always proves ruinous in practice, usually resulting in inside-out hybrids, rather than hyper-adaptive mimics. It's also possible that the meddling of a god spawned the first mimic (it might have even been the mythological Ahad the Mad), but no god known today has outright engineered a monstrosity of such complexity, save for a few varieties of appalling undead.": "因此，我相信模仿者的起源有几种强烈的可能性。我勉强接受的是，有可能是一个有缺陷的（%0%）咒语把一个魔法生物扭曲成了第一个模仿者，但这种篡改在实践中总是被证明是有害的，通常会产生由内而外的混合体，而不是超适应性的模仿者。也有可能是一个神的干预催生了第一个模仿者（甚至可能是神话中的疯狂的阿哈德），但今天已知的神没有直接设计出如此复杂的怪物，除了少数品种的可怕亡灵。",
	"The final, and most curious possibility, is that mimics simply evolved from early oozes, or a similarly amorphous ancestor. Despite how miraculous mimic shapeshifting might seem, it's indicative of a trait honed by natural selection to perfectly fit a specific environment—albeit, of a magical creature in an utterly unique environment. Mimic hunting works best in dark, static, claustrophobic environments, within which they can trick and corner prey. Their ambush tactics are remarkably energy-efficient, allowing them to flourish in environments with sparse wildlife. Lastly, while mimics possess surprising canny, their instincts fail outside of their dungeon habitats, meaning most surfaceborne mimics starve or become a meal rather soon. Such magical natural selection might be an explanation for other monstrosities as well, such as the {@creature darkmantle} and {@creature phase spider}, but that would be a topic for another tome.": "最后，也是最令人好奇的可能性是，模仿者只是从早期的ozes，或类似的无定形祖先中进化而来。尽管模仿者的变形看起来很神奇，但它表明了一种经过自然选择磨练的特性，能够完美地适应特定的环境--尽管是一种完全独特环境中的神奇生物。在黑暗、静止、幽闭的环境中，模仿者的捕猎效果最好，在这种环境中，他们可以欺骗和逼迫猎物。他们的伏击战术非常节省能源，使他们能够在野生动物稀少的环境中蓬勃发展。最后，虽然模仿者拥有惊人的聪明才智，但他们的本能在地牢的栖息地之外就失效了，这意味着大多数水面上的模仿者很快就会挨饿或成为食物。这种神奇的自然选择可能也是对其他怪兽的一种解释，比如（%0%）和（%1%），但这将是另一本书的主题。",
	"Bane to adventurers everywhere, mimics are curious predators that shapeshift into the form of objects commonly found in dungeons: crates, doors, and most often, treasure chests. Once their prey draws close, the mimic ensnares it in their sticky body. Mimics rely on this strategy as it provides an ample supply of food; weary, foolish adventurers are in no short supply and also make for a fine meal.": "模仿者是各地冒险者的祸根，他们是好奇的捕食者，会变身为地下城中常见的物体的形状：箱子、门，以及最常见的宝箱。一旦他们的猎物靠近，模仿者就会用他们粘稠的身体将其困住。模仿者依赖这种策略，因为它能提供充足的食物；疲惫而愚蠢的冒险者也不乏其人，也是一顿美餐。",
	"Dungeoneering wisdom holds that mimics are a sort of karmic justice for unwary adventurers, if not literally, than at least by metaphor. Nearly anything can kill you in a dungeon, from sudden pit traps, to magical curses, to the dungeon's denizens. Mimics, therefore, create a neat illustration for all dungeoneering pitfalls: if you didn't inspect everything carefully and move with caution, that door, or wall, or treasure chest might be a mimic lying in wait.": "地牢学的智慧认为，模仿是对不小心的冒险者的一种因果报应，如果不是字面上的，至少也是通过比喻。在地牢里，几乎任何东西都能杀死你，从突然出现的坑道陷阱，到魔法诅咒，再到地牢里的居民。因此，模仿者为所有的地牢陷阱创造了一个整齐的说明：如果你没有仔细检查所有的东西并谨慎行动，那扇门、墙壁或宝箱可能是一个埋伏着的模仿者。",
	"Mimic biology only allows them to replicate an object while perfectly still; once moving, their eyes, teeth, and purple tongues are on full display. However, mimics which assume a form for too long stiffen in that shape, gaining some traits of their object of choice. A mimic long in the shape of a barrel, for instance, would be able to roll on its side without deforming and might even hold some contents while waiting for the best chance to ambush their prey.": "模仿者的生物学特性只允许他们在完全静止时复制一个物体；一旦移动，他们的眼睛、牙齿和紫色的舌头就会完全展示出来。然而，模仿者如果在一种形态下呆得太久，就会在这种形态下变得僵硬，获得它们所选择的物体的一些特征。例如，一个长期处于桶形的模仿者将能够侧身滚动而不变形，甚至可能在等待伏击猎物的最佳机会时保留一些内容。",
	"It's unavoidable that rolling contested checks for grappling mimics will slow down the game (slow to a crawl if several mimics are in play), so you can use this variant rule in place of grappling:": "为抓取模仿者而滚动有争议的检查会使游戏变慢（如果有几个模仿者在游戏中，会慢到爬行），这是不可避免的，所以你可以用这个变体规则来代替抓取的位置。",
	"{@b {@i Chomp! }} When you would be {@condition grappled} by a mimic, you can immediately make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (your choice) against the mimic's escape DC, instead of being {@condition grappled}. On a failure, the mimic bites down before you escape, dealing damage as if it made a successful bite attack against you.": "{@b {@i Chomp! }} 当你会被一个模仿者咬伤{@condition grappled}时，你可以立即对模仿者的逃脱DC进行力量或灵巧的救赎(你选择)，而不是被咬伤{@condition grappled}。如果失败，拟态会在你逃跑前咬住你，造成伤害，就像它对你进行了一次成功的咬合攻击。",
	"While the majority of mimic{@homebrew kind} are ravenous monstrosities, a handful of them are strikingly intelligent, versed in {@language Common} or {@language Undercommon}, and willing to speak with adventurers, rather than eat them on sight. Such mimics are still monstrous, however, and are driven almost exclusively by hunger, so bartering with food is mandatory for a productive conversation. Once appetites are sated, the mimic might prove to be an invaluable source of information, or might simply get out of the way while the adventuring party passes through.": "虽然大多数的模仿者{@homebrew kind}都是贪婪的怪物，但也有少数模仿者具有惊人的智慧，精通{@language Common}或{@language Undercommon}，并愿意与冒险者交谈，而不是当场吃掉他们。然而，这样的模仿者仍然是畸形的，而且几乎完全被饥饿所驱使，所以要想进行有效的交谈，必须以食物作为交换条件。一旦胃口得到满足，模仿者可能会被证明是一个宝贵的信息来源，也可能只是在冒险者经过的时候让开道路。",
	"To make a mimic of the intelligent variety, give it at least 10 Intelligence, the ability to speak at least one language (usually {@language Common}), and an evil alignment. For extra fun, ensure that they know critical information pertaining to the dungeon's traps, monsters or treasure, so the characters have a reason to consult it.": "要制作一个智能型的模仿者，至少要给它10点智力，至少能说一种语言（通常是（%0%）），并有邪恶的倾向。为了增加乐趣，确保他们知道与地牢的陷阱、怪物或宝藏有关的关键信息，这样人物就有理由去咨询它。",
