As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates).

You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.": "你也可以用这个咒语来探测你看不到的有思想的生物的存在。当你施法时或在持续时间内作为你的行动，你可以在你周围30英尺内搜索思想。该法术可以穿透障碍物，但2英尺的岩石、2英寸的除铅以外的任何金属或薄薄的铅板会阻挡你。你不能探测智力为3或更低的生物，或不说任何语言的生物。",

Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.": "你使自己--包括你的衣服、盔甲、武器和你身上的其他物品--看起来不同，直到咒语结束或你使用行动来解除它。你可以看起来矮一英尺或高一英尺，可以看起来瘦、胖或介于两者之间。你不能改变你的体型，所以你必须采用一个具有相同的基本肢体排列的形式。否则，幻觉的程度由你决定。",
	"The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.": "这个咒语所造成的变化经不起物理检查。例如，如果你用这个咒语在你的衣服上加上一顶帽子，物体会穿过帽子，任何接触到它的人都会毫无感觉，或者会感觉到你的头和头发。如果你用这个咒语使自己看起来比实际情况更瘦，那么伸手触摸你的人的手会撞到你，而它似乎还在半空中。",

The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when {@condition stunned} or otherwise {@condition incapacitated}.": "在这种形态下，目标的唯一移动方式是10英尺的飞行速度。目标可以进入并占据另一个生物的空间。目标对非魔法伤害有抵抗力，并且在力量、灵巧和体质方面有优势。目标可以穿过小洞、狭窄的开口，甚至是单纯的裂缝，尽管它把液体当作固体表面。目标不会坠落，即使在{@condition stunned}或其他情况下{@condition incapacitated}，仍会在空中盘旋。",

	"You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.": "你决定在你施法时什么会触发石刻。对于刻在表面上的石刻，最典型的触发因素包括触摸或站在石刻上，移除覆盖在石刻上的其他物体，接近石刻一定距离内，或操纵刻有石刻的物体。对于刻在物体上的字形，最常见的触发因素包括打开该物体，接近该物体一定距离内，或看到或阅读该字形。一旦一个石刻被触发，这个法术就会结束。",

	"You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.": "你可以在创造石刻的过程中施放一个准备好的三级或更低级的法术，将其储存在石刻中。该法术必须针对一个生物或一个区域。以这种方式施放时，被储存的法术没有即时效果。当石刻被触发时，储存的咒语就会被施放。如果该咒语有一个目标，它的目标是触发字形的生物。如果咒语影响到一个区域，则该区域以该生物为中心。如果该咒语召唤了敌对的生物或创造了有害的物体或陷阱，它们会尽可能地出现在入侵者身边并攻击它。如果该咒语需要集中注意力，它将持续到其全部持续时间结束。",

	"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.": "如果你熟悉目标并且知道它在障碍物之外，你可以通过固体物体施展这个法术。神奇的沉默，1英尺的石头，1英寸的普通金属，薄薄的铅板，或3英尺的木头都能阻挡咒语。咒语不必遵循直线，可以在角落或开口处自由穿行。",
	"Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes {@damage 20d6} fire damage and {@damage 20d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.": "炽热的火球在你能看到的范围内的四个不同点上坠落到地面。以你选择的每个点为中心的40英尺半径范围内的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的救赎动作。球体在转角处扩散。拯救失败时，生物会受到{@damage 20d6}的火焰伤害和{@damage 20d6}的重击伤害，拯救成功则会受到一半的伤害。在一个以上的火爆区域内的生物只受到一次影响。",
	"The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.": "该法术会损害该地区的物体，并点燃没有被佩戴或携带的易燃物。",
	"Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the {@condition charmed} condition. The spell even foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.": "在咒语结束之前，你所接触的一个自愿的生物对精神伤害、任何能感知其情绪或读取其想法的效果、占卜咒语以及{@condition charmed}条件免疫。该法术甚至可以挫败愿望法术和用于影响目标心灵或获得目标信息的类似力量的法术或效果。",
	"You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.": "你在范围内创造一个声音或一个物体的影像，持续时间。如果你把它作为一个行动来解除，或者再次施展这个法术，那么这个幻象也会结束。",
	"If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.": "如果你创造一个声音，它的音量可以从耳语到尖叫不等。它可以是你的声音、别人的声音、狮子的吼叫、鼓声，或者你选择的任何其他声音。声音在整个持续时间内持续不减，或者你可以在咒语结束前的不同时间发出不连续的声音。",
	"If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.": "如果你创造了一个物体的图像--例如一把椅子、泥泞的脚印或一个小箱子--它必须不大于一个5英尺的立方体。该图像不能产生声音、光线、气味或任何其他感官效果。与图像的物理互动显示它是一个幻象，因为东西可以穿过它。",
	"If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.": "如果一个生物用它的行动来检查这个声音或图像，这个生物可以用成功的智力（调查）检查来确定它是一个幻觉，而不是你的法术救赎DC。如果生物辨别出幻觉的真面目，幻觉对生物来说就会变得模糊不清。",
	"You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.": "你让1英里以内的地形看起来、听起来、闻起来，甚至感觉像其他类型的地形。然而，地形的一般形状保持不变。开阔的田野或道路可以被制造成沼泽、山丘、裂缝或其他一些困难或无法通行的地形。一个池塘可以变得像一片草地，一个悬崖像一个平缓的斜坡，或者一个布满岩石的山沟像一条宽阔平整的道路。",
	"Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.": "同样地，你可以改变结构的外观，或者在没有结构的地方增加结构。该法术不能伪装、隐藏或增加生物。",
	"The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.": "幻觉包括听觉、视觉、触觉和嗅觉元素，所以它可以将清晰的地面变成困难的地形（或者反之），或者以其他方式阻碍在该区域的移动。任何一块被移出法术区域的虚幻地形（如石头或棍子）都会立即消失。",
	"Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.": "拥有真实视力的生物可以透过幻象看到地形的真实形态；然而，幻象的所有其他元素仍然存在，所以当生物意识到幻象的存在时，该生物仍然可以与幻象进行物理互动。",
	"Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.": "在你的空间里出现你的三个虚幻的复制体。在咒语结束之前，这些复制品会随着你移动，并模仿你的动作，变换位置，因此无法追踪到哪个形象是真的。你可以用你的行动来解除这些虚幻的复制体。",
	"Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a {@dice d20} to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.": "在法术持续期间，每次有生物以你为目标进行攻击时，都要掷出{@dice d20}来决定该攻击是否以你的一个复制体为目标。",
	"If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.": "如果你有三个复制体，你必须掷出6或更高的分数，才能将攻击的目标改为复制体。如果有两个复制品，你必须掷出8或更高的分数。有一个复制品时，你必须掷出11或更高的分数。",
	"A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.": "一个复制体的攻击力等于10+你的灵巧修正值。如果一次攻击击中了一个复制体，这个复制体就会被摧毁。复制体只能被击中它的攻击摧毁。它无视所有其他的伤害和效果。当所有三个复制体都被摧毁时，该咒语就会结束。",
	"A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.": "如果一个生物看不到，如果它依靠视觉以外的感官，比如盲视，或者如果它能感知到幻觉是假的，比如真视，那么它就不会受到这个法术的影响。",
	"You become {@condition invisible} at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.": "你变得{@condition invisible}的同时，在你所站的地方出现一个你的虚幻替身。这个替身会持续一段时间，但如果你攻击或施法的话，隐身就会结束。",
	"You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.": "你可以用你的行动将你的虚幻替身移动到你的速度的两倍，并使它以你选择的任何方式做出手势、说话和行为。",
	"You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} in regard to your own surroundings.": "你可以通过它的眼睛看，通过它的耳朵听，就像你位于它的位置一样。在你的每个回合中，作为一个额外的动作，你可以从使用它的感官切换到使用你自己的感官，或者再切换回来。当你使用它的感官时，你对自己周围的环境是（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.": "短暂地被银色的雾气所包围，你最多可以传送30英尺到一个你能看到的无人的空间。",
	"You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition charmed} by you for the duration. The {@condition charmed} target is {@condition incapacitated} and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.": "你试图重新塑造另一个生物的记忆。一个你能看到的生物必须做一个智慧储蓄动作。如果你正在与该生物战斗，它在救赎动作上有优势。在拯救失败的情况下，目标会在持续时间内被你变成（%0%）。{@condition charmed}的目标是{@condition incapacitated}，不知道周围的情况，但它仍然可以听到你的声音。如果它受到任何伤害或被其他法术锁定，这个法术就会结束，而且目标的记忆不会被修改。",
	"While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.": "在此符咒持续期间，你可以影响目标对过去24小时内经历的事件的记忆，该事件持续时间不超过10分钟。你可以永久地消除对该事件的所有记忆，让目标以完美的清晰度和精确的细节回忆起该事件，改变其对该事件细节的记忆，或者创造一个对其他事件的记忆。",
	"You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.": "你必须和目标说话来描述它的记忆是如何被影响的，而且它必须能够理解你的语言，以便修改后的记忆能够生根。它的头脑会填补你描述的细节中的任何空白。如果咒语在你描述完修改后的记忆之前就结束了，那么该生物的记忆就不会被改变。否则，当法术结束时，修正的记忆就会生效。",
	"A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.": "修改过的记忆不一定会影响生物的行为方式，尤其是当记忆与生物的自然倾向、排列或信仰相抵触时。一个不合逻辑的修正记忆，比如植入一个关于生物有多喜欢用酸液浇灌自己的记忆，会被驳回，也许是一个噩梦。DM可能会认为修改后的记忆太过无厘头，无法对生物产生重大影响。",
	"A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.": "对目标施以消除诅咒或更大的恢复法术，可恢复生物的真实记忆。",
	"If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).": "如果你使用6级或更高等级的法术槽施放这个法术，你可以改变目标对发生在7天前（6级）、30天前（7级）、1年前（8级）或该生物过去任何时间（9级）的事件的记忆。",
	"A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.": "一束银色的淡色光束以范围内的一个点为中心，以5英尺为半径，40英尺高的圆柱体照射下来。直到咒语结束，昏暗的光线充满了圆柱体。",
	"When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes {@damage 2d10} radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "当一个生物在一个回合中第一次进入该法术的区域，或者在那里开始它的回合，它就会被幽灵般的火焰吞噬，造成灼热的疼痛，而且它必须做一个宪法规定的救赎动作。如果救赎失败，它将受到{@damage 2d10}辐射伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。",
	"A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.": "变形人以劣势的方式进行救赎。如果它失败了，它也会立即恢复到原来的形态，并且在离开咒语的光亮之前不能再有其他形态。",
	"On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.": "在你施展此法术后的每个回合中，你可以使用一个动作将光束向任何方向移动，最远可达60英尺。",

	"Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.": "在范围内选择一个边长不超过40英尺的地形区域。你可以在持续时间内以你选择的任何方式重塑该区域的土、沙或粘土。你可以提高或降低该区域的海拔，创造或填埋一条沟渠，竖起或压平一堵墙，或形成一根柱子。任何此类改变的范围都不能超过该区域最大尺寸的一半。因此，如果你影响到一个40英尺的广场，你可以建立一个高达20英尺的支柱，提高或降低广场的高度，最多20英尺，挖一个最深的沟渠，等等。这些变化需要10分钟才能完成。",
	"At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.": "在你专注于该法术的每10分钟结束时，你可以选择一个新的地形区域来影响。",
	"Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.": "由于地形的转变发生得很慢，该地区的生物通常不能被地面的运动所困住或伤害。",
	"This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.": "这个法术不能操纵天然的石头或石头建筑。岩石和结构会转变以适应新的地形。如果你塑造地形的方式会使结构不稳定，它可能会倒塌。",
	"Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.": "同样地，这个咒语也不直接影响植物的生长。被移动的土地会带着任何植物一起移动。",
	"For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.": "在持续时间内，你将你接触到的一个目标从占卜魔法中隐藏起来。目标可以是一个自愿的生物，或者是一个任何维度上不超过10英尺的地方或物体。该目标不能被任何占卜魔法所锁定，也不能被魔法探查传感器所察觉。",
	"A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection.

The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.": "一个通道出现在你所选择的一个点上，你可以在范围内的木质、灰泥或石质表面（如墙壁、天花板或地板）看到，并持续一段时间。你选择开口的尺寸：最宽5英尺，高8英尺，深20英尺。该通道不会在其周围的结构中产生不稳定。",
	"When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.": "当开口消失时，任何仍在由咒语创造的通道中的生物或物体都会被安全地弹出到离你施放咒语的表面最近的一个未被占用的空间。",
	"You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 4d10} psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.": "你在你能看到的范围内挖掘一个生物的噩梦，并创造一个其最深层恐惧的虚幻表现，只对该生物可见。目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。在拯救失败的情况下，目标会在持续时间内变成（%0%）。在咒语结束前，目标的每个回合结束时，目标必须成功进行智慧救赎，否则会受到1%的精神伤害。拯救成功后，咒语结束。",

	"For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.": "在持续时间内，你或你选择的一个生物可以骑上这匹骏马。该生物使用骑马的统计数据，只是它的速度为100英尺，一小时可以走10英里，或以快节奏走13英里。当咒语结束时，骏马会逐渐消退，给骑手1分钟的时间下马。如果你使用一个动作来解除它，或者如果骏马受到任何伤害，咒语就会结束。",
	"You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power.

	"When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.": "当生物出现时，它没有被强迫以任何特定方式行事。你可以要求该生物提供服务以换取报酬，但它没有义务这样做。要求的任务可以是简单的（让我们飞过鸿沟，或帮助我们打仗），也可以是复杂的（监视我们的敌人，或在我们进入地牢时保护我们）。你必须能够与该生物沟通，为其服务讨价还价。",

Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.": "付款可以采取多种形式。天人可能需要向盟友的寺庙捐赠大量的黄金或魔法物品，而恶魔可能要求活人献祭或赠送宝物。有些生物可能会用他们的服务换取你的任务。",
	"As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.": "根据经验，以分钟为单位的任务需要每分钟支付100金币。以小时计算的任务，每小时需要1000金币。而以天为单位的任务（最多10天），每天需要10,000金币。DM可以根据你施法的情况来调整这些报酬。如果任务与生物的精神气质相一致，报酬可能会减半甚至免除。无害的任务通常只需要建议报酬的一半，而特别危险的任务可能需要更大的礼物。生物很少接受那些看起来像自杀的任务。",

The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.": "使用此法术，你试图将一个（%0%）、一个（%1%）、一个（%2%）或一个（%3%）的生物捆绑在你的身边。在整个施法过程中，该生物必须在施法范围内。(通常情况下，该生物首先被召唤到一个倒置的魔法阵的中心，以便在施法时将其困住。） 在施法结束后，目标必须做一个 \"魅力拯救\"。如果救赎失败，它将在持续时间内被束缚为你服务。如果该生物是由其他法术召唤或创造的，则该法术的持续时间将延长至与此法术的持续时间一致。",

If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.": "目标被切断的身体成员（手指、腿、尾巴等），如果有的话，会在2分钟后恢复。如果你拥有被切断的部分，并将其按在残肢上，该法术会瞬间使肢体与残肢结成一体。",
	"You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.": "你触摸一个死去的人形生物或一个死去的人形生物的碎片。只要该生物的死亡时间不超过10天，该咒语就会为它形成一个新的成年身体，然后召唤灵魂进入该身体。如果目标的灵魂不自由或不愿意这样做，则法术失败。",
	"The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a {@dice d100} and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.": "这个魔法为这个生物塑造了一个新的身体，这很可能导致这个生物的种族改变。DM掷出{@dice d100}并参考下表来决定该生物在恢复生命时采取什么形式，或者由DM选择一种形式。",
	"The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.": "转世后的生物会回忆起它以前的生活和经历。它保留了原来形态下的能力，只是将原来的种族换成新的种族，并相应地改变其种族特征。",
	"At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.": "在你的触摸下，所有影响一个生物或物体的诅咒都会结束。如果该物体是被诅咒的魔法物品，它的诅咒仍然存在，但该咒语打破了它的主人与该物体的联系，因此它可以被移除或丢弃。",
	"A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.": "一个闪闪发光的球体将范围内的大型或小型生物或物体包围起来。不愿意的生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果拯救失败，该生物将在持续时间内被包围。",
	"Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.": "没有任何东西--不是物理物体、能量或其他法术效果--可以通过屏障，不管是进去还是出来，尽管球体中的生物可以在那里呼吸。球体对所有伤害免疫，里面的生物或物体不能被来自外部的攻击或效果所伤害，球体内的生物也不能伤害球体外的东西。",
	"The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.": "球体是无重的，其大小刚好可以容纳里面的生物或物体。一个被包围的生物可以用它的行动来推动球体的墙壁，从而以该生物一半的速度滚动球体。同样地，球体可以被其他生物拿起并移动。",
	"A {@spell disintegrate} spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.": "一个针对地球的{@spell disintegrate}法术会摧毁它，但不会伤害到里面的任何东西。",
	"You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.": "你接触一个愿意的生物。在咒语结束前，目标可以掷骰子（%0%），并将掷出的数字加入它所选择的一个救赎动作。它可以在做救赎动作之前或之后掷骰子。然后法术结束。",
	"You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.": "你触摸一个死了不超过一个世纪的生物，它没有老死，也不是亡灵。如果它的灵魂是自由的、愿意的，那么目标就会带着它的所有命中率恢复生命。",
	"This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.": "这个咒语可以中和任何毒药，并治愈生物死亡时患的普通疾病。然而，它并不能消除魔法疾病、诅咒等；如果在施法前没有消除这些影响，它们会在目标恢复生命时影响它。",
	"This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.": "这个法术可以封闭所有致命的伤口，并恢复任何丢失的身体部位。",
	"Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.": "施放这个法术来恢复已经死亡一年或更长时间的生物的生命，会给你带来很大的负担。在你完成长时间的休息之前，你不能再次施法，而且你在所有的攻击卷、能力检查和蓄力攻击中都处于劣势。",
	"This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.": "这个法术在一个半径为50英尺、高100英尺的圆柱体中扭转重力，以范围内的一个点为中心。当你施展这个法术时，所有在该区域内没有以某种方式固定在地面上的生物和物体都会向上坠落并到达该区域的顶部。生物可以做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，抓住它能够到的固定物体，从而避免掉落。",
	"If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.": "如果在这个坠落过程中遇到一些坚固的物体（如天花板），坠落的物体和生物就会像在正常的向下坠落过程中那样撞击它。如果一个物体或生物到达该区域的顶部而没有撞击到任何东西，它就会停留在那里，略微摆动，持续一段时间。",
	"At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.": "在持续时间结束时，受影响的物体和生物会重新倒下。",
	"You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.": "你触摸一个在过去一分钟内死亡的生物。该生物会以1点命中率恢复生命。这个法术不能使因年老而死亡的生物恢复生命，也不能恢复任何缺失的身体部位。",
	"You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.": "你触摸一段长达60英尺的绳子。绳子的一端会升到空中，直到整条绳子垂直于地面悬挂。在绳子的上端，一个看不见的入口打开，通向一个超维空间，持续到咒语结束。",
	"The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.": "攀登到绳索的顶端就可以到达这个超维空间。这个空间可以容纳多达八个中型或小型生物。绳子可以被拉入空间，使绳子从空间外的视野中消失。",
	"Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.": "攻击和法术不能穿过入口进入或离开这个超维空间，但里面的人可以看到外面，就像通过一个3英尺乘5英尺的窗户，以绳子为中心。",
	"Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.": "咒语结束时，超维空间内的任何东西都会掉出来。",
	"Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.": "火焰般的光芒降临到你能看到的范围内的生物身上。目标必须在灵巧的投掷中成功，否则会受到{@damage 1d8}辐射伤害。目标不会从这个蓄力动作的掩护中获得好处。",
	"You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a {@spell fireball}.": "你守护范围内的一个生物免受攻击。在咒语结束之前，任何用攻击或有害咒语攻击被守护生物的生物都必须先做一个智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物必须选择一个新的目标，否则将失去攻击或施法的机会。这个法术并不能保护被守护的生物免受区域效应的影响，例如一个（%0%）的爆炸。",
	"If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.": "如果被守护的生物进行攻击、施放影响敌人的咒语，或对另一生物造成伤害，则此咒语结束。",

	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.": "当你使用3级或更高等级的法术槽施展此法术时，你为2级以上的每一个法术槽等级创造一个额外的射线。",
	"You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.": "你可以看到和听到你选择的与你在同一平面的特定生物。目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作，这个动作会根据你对目标的了解程度和你与它的物理联系的种类而改变。如果目标知道你在施展这个法术，如果它想被观察，它可以自愿不做拯救动作。",
