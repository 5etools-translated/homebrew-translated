There are rumors that evil wizards resort to petrifying beautiful youths to get the materials they need for construction.": "大理石雕像通常被雕刻成过去的美丽英雄和统治者的样子。建造它们的巫师需要伟大的工匠的服务，因为石像的特征必须非常逼真，才能使动画的魔法生效。有传言说，邪恶的巫师为了得到他们所需的建筑材料，不惜将美丽的年轻人石化。",
	"Aesthetic Guardians. Marble golems are usually set to guard areas where aesthetic beauty is desired—temples, palaces, libraries, or estates.

	"Narcissistic Spirits. Marble golems are animated by spirits plucked from the elemental planes and forcibly bound into artificial bodies. The spirits unwittingly attracted to these particular constructs are always vain, and golem builders take advantage of their conceited natures when weaving the necessary binding spells.

Great care is therefore given to ensuring that marble golems are displayed in such a way that their beauty is emphasized and respected.": "自恋的精神。大理石雕像是由从元素界挖来的灵魂激活的，并被强行捆绑在人造身体上。不知不觉中被吸引到这些特殊构造中的灵魂总是虚荣的，而巨石像的建造者在编织必要的束缚咒语时利用了他们自负的天性。只要精神发现它的新形式和周围环境适当地美丽，它就不太可能挣脱其主人的控制。因此，人们非常注意确保大理石雕像的展示方式，以强调和尊重它们的美。",

	"Free-Spirited Nomads. Centaurs do not create permanent settlements and instead constantly roam, setting up new temporary camps wherever the hunting is best. They look to the stars to determine when it is time to move on to new pastures. Living off of game and the occasional foraging, centaurs find the concept of agriculture very strange. Such practices require becoming rooted to one place, and they view the domestication of animals to be a complete perversion of nature.": "自由奔放的游牧者。半人马不建立永久的定居点，而是不断地漫游，在狩猎条件好的地方建立新的临时营地。他们仰望星空，以确定什么时候该搬到新的牧场。半人马以猎物和偶尔的觅食为生，发现农业的概念非常奇怪。这种做法需要扎根于一个地方，而且他们认为驯化动物是对自然的完全颠倒。",

	"Centaur history reaches back to long before the arrival of the settler races. When the first settlers arrived, the centaur tribes were largely indifferent to their presence. But during the First War, the Dragonlords and the Five Gods struck devastating blows against the centaur tribes. This has resulted in long-lasting enmity. Consequently, for the past several centuries, the centaurs have increasingly sought to drive the trespassing settler races out of Thylea by any means necessary.": "半人马的历史可以追溯到定居者种族到来之前很久。当第一批定居者到达时，半人马部落对他们的存在基本无动于衷。但在第一次战争中，龙王和五神对半人马部落进行了毁灭性的打击。这导致了长期的敌意。因此，在过去的几个世纪里，半人马越来越多地试图通过任何必要的手段将入侵的定居种族赶出蒂勒亚。",

	"Something to Prove. Despite their almost comical appearance, blemys are formidable foes. Underestimating their capabilities can lead to an untimely death. A blemys that does not receive due and proper deference from weaker creatures will demonstrate its giant strength by tearing such disrespectful foes apart. Blemys are frequently assumed to be unintelligent due to their lack of a cranium, and many non-blemys believe, incorrectly, that they are literally brainless. In fact, blemys are the most intelligent type of cyclops. They can outwit the average mortal settler, just as they outwitted their civilized cousins, the gygans, in ages past. The best strategy to avoid conflict with a blemys is to challenge it to a battle of wits. Letting the blemys win and then begging for mercy may be flattering enough for it to spare the loser's life. If a blemys is beaten by an obviously superior intellect, its humiliation will likely drive it to attack in a fit of rage. In such situations, opponents can take advantage of the blemys' limited field of view. If a dexterous and observant individual avoids the blemys' extreme tunnel vision for long enough, then it may be convinced that its quarry has escaped and give up its search in tearful frustration.": "需要证明的东西。尽管漂泊者的外表几乎是滑稽的，但他们是可怕的敌人。低估它们的能力会导致它们的不幸死亡。一个没有从弱小生物那里得到应有的和适当的尊重的blemys，会通过把这些不尊重的敌人撕碎来显示其巨大的力量。由于没有头颅，人们经常认为斑纹鱼没有智慧，许多非斑纹鱼的人错误地认为它们真的没有大脑。事实上，blemys是剑水蚤中最聪明的类型。它们可以智取一般的凡人定居者，就像它们在过去的年代里智取它们的文明表亲--吉甘人一样。避免与blemys发生冲突的最佳策略是向它挑战，进行一场智慧的较量。让blemys赢，然后求饶，可能会让它受宠若惊，从而饶过失败者的性命。如果漂泊者被明显具有优势的智力击败，它的羞辱很可能会促使它在愤怒中进行攻击。在这种情况下，对手可以利用blemys的有限视野。如果一个灵巧的、善于观察的人躲避出血虫的极端隧道视野足够长的时间，那么它可能会相信它的猎物已经逃脱，并在流泪的沮丧中放弃搜寻。",
	"Nomadic Lifestyle. Blemys' prickly personalities and antisocial tendencies prevent these creatures from forming communities. They live by raiding poorly-defended settlements for food and other goods, and given the opportunity, they may even steal from their own kindred. As a result, blemys often find themselves wandering alone, as they are quickly driven from an area once survivors of their raids recover and organize.": "游牧的生活方式。Blemys的多刺性格和反社会倾向使这些生物无法形成社区。它们靠袭击防御薄弱的定居点获取食物和其他物品为生，如果有机会，它们甚至可能偷窃自己的同类。因此，漂泊者经常发现自己在独自徘徊，因为一旦袭击的幸存者恢复并组织起来，他们很快就会被赶出一个地区。",
	"Uncertain Origins. The origin of these outlandish cyclopes is unknown. Some scholars believe that their condition is a divine curse. Blemys progenitors may have comprised a civilization of particularly intelligent, charismatic, and social cyclopes that were uncharacteristically prone to vanity. This, possibly combined with the nonreligious nature of most cyclopes, attracted the attention of cruel gods who decided to punish them for their pride and narcissism. Robbed of their good looks and affluence, the blemys' civilization quickly collapsed, driving their descendants into lonely lives of perpetual dissatisfaction.": "不确定的起源。这些怪异的独眼巨人的起源不详。一些学者认为，他们的状况是一种神圣的诅咒。Blemys的祖先可能是由一群特别聪明、有魅力、善于交际的独眼巨人组成的文明，他们一反常态地容易产生虚荣心。这可能与大多数独眼巨人的非宗教性质相结合，吸引了残忍的神的注意，他们决定惩罚他们的骄傲和自恋。由于被剥夺了俊美的外表和富裕的生活，漂泊者的文明很快就崩溃了，使他们的后代陷入了永远不满足的孤独生活。",

	"Civilized. Unlike typical cyclopes, gygans echo their once-great civilization in their current lives. Instead of a city-state comprised of a single grand metropolis and the surrounding area, the gygans of today form groups based around a powerful family. A gygan community begins with a grand founder family estate that is built up over time, that attracts solitary gygans and mates from other family groups. These newcomers construct their own homes nearby, creating patches of relatively secure farmland between estates. Gygans within these family groups cooperate to produce food, wine, clothing, art, and entertainment. These self-sustaining communities rarely interact with non-gygans. Consequently, each insular family group develops a distinct culture that may be lost completely if disaster strikes the community. Some gygan family groups have become so isolated that their members speak dialects not intelligible to other speakers of giant or common, including other gygans in the same area.": "文明的。与典型的独眼巨人不同，吉普赛人在他们目前的生活中呼应他们曾经的伟大文明。今天的吉普赛人不是由一个单一的大都市和周边地区组成的城邦，而是以一个强大的家族为基础形成群体。一个gygan社区开始于一个宏伟的创始人家族庄园，随着时间的推移，它吸引了孤独的gygan人和来自其他家族团体的伴侣。这些新来者在附近建造自己的家园，在庄园之间创造了一些相对安全的农田。这些家族群体中的吉普赛人合作生产食物、酒、服装、艺术和娱乐。这些自我维持的社区很少与非吉普赛人交流。因此，每个孤立的家庭团体发展出一种独特的文化，如果灾难降临到社区，可能会完全丧失。一些吉甘家族群体已经变得如此孤立，以至于他们的成员所讲的方言无法被其他讲巨人或普通话的人所理解，包括同一地区的其他吉甘人。",

	"Enchanting Melodies. A keledone's greatest weapon is her magnificent voice, which has the power to evoke both soothing comfort and haunting despair in all who hear it. One of her songs dredges up and intensifies a listener's most sorrowful memories, which may break the psyche of those with lesser wills. Another tune lulls a keledone's aggressors into a deep sleep. Depending upon the severity of her victim's transgression, a keledone may continue her somnolent song long enough that her target dies of dehydration. However, the keledone do not only use their songs for offensive purposes; they have been known to grant calmness and peace to the minds of troubled mortal supplicants.": "迷人的旋律。凯莱通最伟大的武器是她宏亮的声音，它有能力唤起所有听到它的人的舒缓安慰和萦绕的绝望。她的一首歌曲挖出并强化了听众最悲伤的记忆，这可能会打破那些意志力较弱的人的心理。另一首曲子则让凯利多的侵略者陷入深深的睡眠。根据受害者犯罪的严重程度，Keledone可能会继续她的昏睡之歌，直到她的目标因脱水而死亡。然而，Keledone不仅将其歌曲用于攻击性目的；它们还被认为可以让陷入困境的凡人祈求者的心灵得到平静和安宁。",

	"Mechanical Will. The keledone are intelligent constructs imbued with a self-awareness that is rare among automatons.

	"Twisted in body and mind, the hideous gigantes would be a pitiable form of giant were it not for their prodigious cruelty and bloodlust. Gigantes feel driven to kill any intelligent creature they encounter, with the exception of other gigantes—though their violent and unhinged nature means that even minor disagreements between gigantes usually end in bloodshed. Despite these flaws, gigantes are far from dumb brutes, and the average gigantes is as intelligent as the average human. This, combined with their great strength and erratic, unpredictable behavior, makes the gigantes a particularly dangerous foe.": "狰狞的巨人身心扭曲，如果不是因为他们惊人的残忍和嗜血，他们将是一个可怜的巨人形式。巨人感到被驱使着去杀死他们遇到的任何智慧生物，除了其他巨人--尽管他们的暴力和不正常的本性意味着即使是巨人之间的小分歧也通常以流血告终。尽管有这些缺陷，巨兽远不是愚蠢的畜生，一般的巨兽和普通人一样聪明。这一点，再加上他们强大的力量和反复无常、不可预测的行为，使巨兽成为特别危险的敌人。",

	"Social Structure. Although gigantes form social groups, these bands can hardly be called a \"community.\" Each loosely structured group is held together by two or three gigantes witches that claim to draw power from their sleeping god, Hergeron.

The euryale's serpentine body can encircle and crush smaller creatures with ease. Barbed, venomous quills line the bodies of some euryales, and these quills can be detached and used as arrows to strike at foes that stand out of reach.

In other cases, capricious beings may transform the medusa for no better reason than their own amusement, hoping to unleash chaos upon the Material Plane. The rare euryale that does not consent to this change often goes mad, leaving its lair to seek vengeance upon whichever unfortunate souls it happens to encounter.": "邪恶的契约。仅仅是时间还不足以让冥王星变成尤里阿勒。那些希望获得更大力量的人必须寻找一个强大的邪恶实体，例如恶魔领主或大恶魔。美杜莎可能会同意执行特定的任务，或者承诺为这种生物提供服务，以换取其魔法。在其他情况下，反复无常的生物可能会为了自己的娱乐而改造冥王星，希望在物质世界释放出混乱。罕见的不同意这种变化的尤里里常常会发疯，离开它的巢穴，向它碰巧遇到的任何不幸的灵魂寻求报复。",

Consequently, the gods imprisoned the myrmekes on a remote island not long after their creation.

Thanks to these abilities, powerful mortals frequently fall in love with naiads, and they are the most likely of all nymphs to give birth to mortal children with grand destinies.": "Naiads因其巨大的美貌和才能而被凡人所垂涎。她们通常有能力预知凡人的命运。众所周知，她们利用这种能力来塑造历史，作为神秘的神谕和顾问。Naiads也是伟大的艺术家和音乐家的缪斯女神，把他们带到只有超自然的帮助才能激发的创造水平。由于这些能力，强大的凡人经常爱上Naiads，而且她们是所有仙女中最有可能生出具有宏伟命运的凡人子女的。",

	"Nereids are beautiful female fey that dwell beneath the ocean waves. There, they fiercely defend coral reefs and all natural life that dwell within it. Although quick swimmers in their own right, nereids often seek the aid of dolphin or seahorse mounts to bolster their effectiveness in battle. Nereids are as attached to such creatures as paladins are to their steeds; should the animal fall in battle, its rider may be overcome by grief. Each nereid wields her own personal trident, which is grown from the same coral they protect. Although they are dangerous when threatened, nereid sightings are considered to be a portent of good luck for sailors. Wise captains know to steer clear of their reefs, so as to avoid damaging them with the ship's anchor. In addition to their skill as warriors, nereids are also well known for their exquisite voices, which can travel through water undistorted. Unlike the songs of many other aquatic fey, nereids do not weave enchantments into their music; they sing for beauty's sake.": "尼瑞德是居住在海浪下的美丽女性精灵。在那里，她们猛烈地保卫着珊瑚礁和居住在其中的所有自然生命。虽然她们自己游得很快，但尼瑞德经常寻求海豚或海马坐骑的帮助，以提高她们在战斗中的效率。奈瑞德对这种生物的依恋就像圣骑士对他们的骏马一样；如果动物在战斗中倒下，它的骑手可能会被悲伤所征服。每个尼瑞德都挥舞着她自己的三叉戟，三叉戟是由她们保护的珊瑚生长而成的。虽然它们在受到威胁时很危险，但看到海妖被认为是水手们的好运预兆。明智的船长知道要避开它们的礁石，以避免用船锚损坏它们。除了作为战士的技能外，尼瑞德还以其精湛的嗓音而闻名，它可以不受干扰地在水中传播。与许多其他水生精灵的歌声不同，尼瑞德不在音乐中编织魔法；她们为美而歌。",
	"Benthic Beauties. Nereids are sometimes mistaken for merfolk at first glance. They possess streamlined, slightly alien features that are as striking as they are beautiful. Diaphanous webbing connects the fingers and toes of a nereid, and their slick skin resembles that of a dolphin, albeit in various shades of blue and green. Some nereids have additional fish-like traits, such as visible gills and fins that run along their limbs and back, though this aspect of their anatomy is highly variable, depending on their tribe.": "底栖美女。奈瑞德有时会被误认为是人鱼。他们拥有流线型的、略带异形的特征，既醒目又美丽。尼瑞德人的手指和脚趾之间有透明的网状物相连，他们光滑的皮肤类似于海豚的皮肤，尽管有不同程度的蓝色和绿色。一些尼瑞德人还有其他类似鱼类的特征，如可见的鳃和鳍，沿着他们的四肢和背部运行，尽管他们在这方面的解剖结构变化很大，取决于他们的部落。",
	"Guiding the Lost. Many nereids display a level of benevolence towards humanoids that is rare among fey. Nereids have been known to shepherd lost sailors safely back to civilization, provided that they show adequate respect for nature. Some nereids even establish long-term relationships with the sailors who frequent their waters, steering their ships away from the sea's many hidden dangers.": "引导迷失者。许多尼瑞德对人类表现出一定程度的仁慈，这在费族中是罕见的。众所周知，只要迷失的水手对自然表现出足够的尊重，尼瑞德就会把他们安全地送回文明社会。一些尼瑞德人甚至与经常出入他们水域的水手建立了长期的关系，引导他们的船只远离大海中的许多隐患。",
	"Defenders of Reefs. Nereids are bound to protect a specific coral reef, just as dryads are bound to their forests. Overtly hostile nereids are rare, and they usually do not discourage the intrusion of mortals into their domains. However, visitors should be wary to not mistake their relatively kind natures for softness; should their homes be at all harmed or threatened, nereids retaliate en-masse with a piranha-like tenacity, giving no quarter to their prey.": "珊瑚礁的捍卫者。尼瑞德受到保护特定珊瑚礁的约束，就像干尸被约束在他们的森林一样。公开敌对的尼瑞德是罕见的，而且他们通常不阻止凡人侵入他们的领域。然而，游客应该警惕，不要把他们相对善良的天性误认为是软弱；如果他们的家园受到任何伤害或威胁，尼瑞德会以食人鱼般的坚韧集体报复，对他们的猎物毫不留情。",

They are invariably flashy, dressing in brightly-colored clothing and heavily adorning themselves in jewelry.": "海洋族是一种游走在海岸线上的精灵，他们的到来往往会带来音乐和欢愉。他们以对人类的迷恋而闻名，并在很大程度上采取模仿这些种族的英俊男性成员的形式。海洋人崇拜各种类型的美，但个人缺乏微妙的感觉。他们总是很浮夸，穿着颜色鲜艳的衣服，用珠宝大量地装饰自己。",
	"Mutable Shapes. Oceanids are shapeshifters who typically take forms that are almost physically indistinguishable from male humanoids. An oceanid rarely assumes a single guise for more than a month or two at a time, but he may revisit an identity later on. Many bear minor tells that go largely unnoticed, such as too-green eyes or sweat that smells too closely of ocean brine. Though they may lack \"true forms,\" oceanids sometimes also appear as creatures akin to water elementals, albeit in a closer approximation of human shape.": "可变异的形状。海洋人是变身者，他们通常采取与男性人类几乎没有区别的形态。一个海洋人很少在超过一两个月的时间里扮演一个角色，但他可能会在以后重新审视一个身份。许多人都有一些不为人知的小毛病，如眼睛太绿或汗液中含有太多海洋盐水的味道。虽然他们可能缺乏 \"真正的形式\"，但海洋人有时也会以类似于水元素的生物出现，尽管更接近于人类的形状。",
	"Tricksters of the Shore. Oceanids spend much of their time tricking and playing pranks upon mortals. These tricks are usually harmless, but they can be infuriating. A common example of an oceanid prank is to exchange jewelry for other valuable trinkets—items that soon crumble into sand once the oceanid takes his leave. However, some oceanid pranks can turn fatal, often in the form of drownings. In another favorite oceanid prank, the oceanid lures his target into dangerous currents with illusory calm waters. Although some oceanids are indeed malicious, any deaths resulting from their pranks are usually unintentional. Oceanids can be poor judges of mortal swimming ability and lead victims to their dooms in their ignorance. When such a fate befalls an object of an oceanid's affections, he may become so overcome with grief that he dissolves into seafoam.": "岸边的恶作剧者。海洋之神的大部分时间都在欺骗和恶作剧凡人。这些恶作剧通常是无害的，但也可能是令人气愤的。一个常见的海洋生物恶作剧的例子是用珠宝换取其他有价值的饰品--一旦海洋生物离开，这些物品很快就会碎成沙子。然而，有些海洋生物的恶作剧可能会变成致命的，通常是以溺水的形式。在另一个最受欢迎的海洋生物恶作剧中，海洋生物用虚幻的平静水域引诱他的目标进入危险的洋流。虽然有些海洋生物确实是恶意的，但他们的恶作剧造成的任何死亡通常是无意的。海洋生物对凡人的游泳能力判断不足，在无知的情况下将受害者引向厄运。当这种命运降临到海洋生物的感情对象身上时，他可能会变得如此悲伤，以至于变成海泡石。",
	"Consummate Musicians. Like many fey creatures, oceanids have a fondness for music and are skilled players of lutes, lyres, and other stringed instruments. Many oceanids delight in sharing their expertise with humanoids, and their pupils often go on to become famous bards. Although not always a means of enchantment, some oceanids use their songs to magically attract mortals to the shore. Such lures are often necessary, as oceanids begin to lose their mental faculties if they stray too far inland. However, their intentions for doing so vary: one oceanid may simply want an audience, while another may seek to draw in new victims for his pranks.": "完美的音乐家。像许多精灵生物一样，海洋生物对音乐情有独钟，是琵琶、琴和其他弦乐器的熟练演奏者。许多海洋人乐于与人类分享他们的专长，他们的学生经常成为著名的吟游诗人。虽然不一定是施展魔法的手段，但有些海洋生物用他们的歌声神奇地吸引凡人到岸边。这种引诱往往是必要的，因为海洋生物如果在内陆游荡得太远，就会开始丧失智力。然而，他们这样做的目的各不相同：一个海洋生物可能只是想要一个听众，而另一个则可能试图为他的恶作剧引来新的受害者。",

	"With an appearance that treads the line between the comedic and horrific, the ichthys is a twisted centaur-like creature with a humanoid upper body that protrudes from the shell of a massive crab. This monster is the result of a cruel curse bestowed by the gods upon merfolk and other aquatic humanoids, usually as punishment for severe transgressions. As a result of their loathsome origins, most merfolk look upon ichthyses with utter disgust, and the creatures become outcast from merfolk societies. Doomed to aimlessly wander the seafloor, the ichthys becomes consumed by the desire to search for victims as outlets for its unrelenting pain and anger The only joys it knows are those of torture and senseless bloodshed. Most ichthyses continue to wield the same weapons they did before their transformation. Hence, the creatures tend to favor tridents and other implements used by merfolk.": "ichthys的外形介于喜剧和恐怖之间，是一种扭曲的半人马状生物，它的上半身从巨大的螃蟹壳里伸出来，像人一样。这种怪物是诸神赐予人鱼和其他水生类人的残酷诅咒的结果，通常是作为对严重过失的惩罚。由于它们令人厌恶的出身，大多数人鱼都对ichthyses嗤之以鼻，这种生物被人鱼社会所抛弃。ichthys注定要在海底漫无目的地游荡，它被寻找受害者的欲望所吞噬，以此来发泄它无尽的痛苦和愤怒，它唯一知道的乐趣就是折磨和无意义的流血。大多数ichthyses继续挥舞着他们变身前的相同武器。因此，这种生物往往喜欢三叉戟和其他人鱼使用的工具。",
	"Tortured Forms. An ichthys's body is racked with perpetual pain, and any attempts at quick movement are especially agonizing. This state is a product of the strain put upon crustacean anatomy that is not designed to support heavy humanoid torsos.

Pain and poor balance create a plodding, awkward gait paired with a relatively slow swimming speed.": "痛苦的形式。ichthys的身体被永久的疼痛折磨着，任何快速运动的尝试都是特别痛苦的。这种状态是甲壳动物解剖学上的压力的产物，而甲壳动物的设计并不是为了支撑沉重的人形躯干。尽管它的生理结构不兼容，但鱼人的身体仍然通过诅咒的魔法继续运作。疼痛和糟糕的平衡创造了一种蹒跚的、笨拙的步态，与相对缓慢的游泳速度相配。",
	"Macabre Artists. Although largely nomadic, ichthyses set up temporary camps on the seafloor. There, an ichthys uses the bodies of its victims as bait to draw the attentions of both food and other humanoids. An ichthys arranges these corpses to create grotesque sculpture gardens. It often begins to \"sculpt\" its subjects when they are still alive, tying them in place before further carving into their flesh. An ichthys will sometimes leave a victim half dead, as their feeble attempts at escape make for an excellent lure.": "宏伟的艺术家。虽然在很大程度上是游牧民族，但鱼人在海底建立了临时营地。在那里，一条鱼用受害者的尸体作为诱饵，吸引食物和其他人类的注意。裂腹鱼将这些尸体排列起来，创造出怪诞的雕塑花园。它经常在其对象还活着的时候就开始 \"雕刻\"，在进一步雕刻他们的肉体之前将他们绑在原地。ichthys有时会让受害者半死不活，因为他们微弱的逃跑企图是一个很好的诱饵。",

Very few creatures can successfully sneak past a cerebus hound that guards a doorway or treasure. Tortured by Hags. Hags train these creatures through abuse designed to instill fear and rage. No hound in their charge is ever shown affection, and they are kept either in total isolation or attached to chains too short to allow the pups to comfort each other. Large groups of cerberus hounds are sometimes given very little food, in order to identify weaker dogs for culling. The hags then sew shut the mouths of the runts and encourage their former packmates to devour them. The hags also present the hounds with captive humanoids, bound and mutilated, in order to give them a taste for blood.": "这些三头犬有时被称为 \"阴间犬 \"或 \"冥王犬\"，它们被培育成终极守护者。很少有生物能成功地溜过守卫门口或宝藏的塞伯斯猎犬。被女巫折磨。巫师通过虐待来训练这些生物，旨在灌输恐惧和愤怒。他们所负责的猎犬都没有得到过爱护，它们要么被完全隔离，要么被拴在太短的链子上，无法让幼犬互相安慰。大群的地狱犬有时会得到极少的食物，以便找出较弱的狗进行宰杀。然后女巫们会缝上幼犬的嘴，并鼓励它们以前的伙伴吞噬它们。女巫们还向猎犬们提供被捆绑和肢解的人形动物，以便让它们尝到血的滋味。",
	"Progenitors of Death Dogs. Cerebus hounds can spawn litters of death dogs. They will only do this if there is enough food to satiate the hunger of all the hounds. The death dogs acknowledge the cerebus as the pack alpha. Whenever a cerebus dies, the death dogs fight for primacy. The victor devours the losers, and over the course of a month, it grows a new head, becoming a new cerebus to replace the original.": "死亡犬的祖先。脑膜炎猎犬可以产下一窝死亡犬。只有在有足够的食物来满足所有猎犬的饥饿感时，它们才会这样做。死亡之犬承认脑膜炎犬为族群首领。每当一只脑鼠死亡，死亡之犬就会为争夺首领地位而战。胜利者吞噬失败者，在一个月的时间里，它长出一个新的头，成为一个新的cerebus，取代原来的。",
	"Fearsome Guardians. Cerberus hounds take pride in sniffing out and devouring trespassers. Once they have been set to guard something, they never tire of their charge, even should hundreds of years pass without incident. Most hounds keep piles of their victims' bones as beloved trophies to gnaw on. Although the hound does require sleep, it rarely succumbs to the urge, and only one of its heads sleeps at any given time.": "可怕的守护者。地狱犬以嗅出和吞噬闯入者为荣。一旦它们被派去看守某样东西，它们就会不厌其烦地执行任务，即使几百年来没有发生过任何事件。大多数猎犬把受害者的骨头堆在一起，作为心爱的战利品来啃食。虽然猎犬确实需要睡眠，但它很少屈服于这种冲动，而且在任何时候都只有一个头在睡觉。",

	"Dread Beasts": "恐惧的野兽",
	"Dread beasts are hulking undead animals raised by Lutheria, Mistress of Death and Lady of Dreams. These creatures typify both of her domains, as these twisted mockeries of life are nightmarish indeed. Dread beasts engage in few—if any—of the behaviors they did in life and are almost universally driven to slaughter any humanoid they encounter. While most of these creatures lurk in the hidden, barely-trod corners of the world, others conduct nocturnal raids against villages and other civilized communities. After it has been raised, a dread beast continues to rot, creating a nauseating odor that is sometimes pungent enough to poison living creatures unlucky enough to be in its vicinity. Although the creature's flesh festers and falls away, this process does nothing to diminish its considerable strength. When a dread beast survives long enough, it eventually becomes little more than a skeleton, held together only by the will of powerful dark magic.": "恐惧兽是由死亡的女主人和梦境的女士卢瑟亚饲养的巨大的不死动物。这些生物是她两个领域的典型，因为这些扭曲的生命嘲弄确实是噩梦般的。恐惧的野兽很少--如果有的话--从事它们生前的行为，而且几乎普遍被驱使去屠杀它们遇到的任何类人。虽然这些生物大多潜伏在隐蔽的、几乎无人问津的世界角落，但其他生物则对村庄和其他文明社区进行夜间袭击。在被饲养后，可怕的野兽会继续腐烂，产生令人作呕的气味，有时刺鼻的气味足以毒害不幸在其附近的生物。虽然该生物的肉会腐烂并脱落，但这一过程并不能削弱它的巨大力量。当一个可怕的野兽存活了足够长的时间，它最终会变成一副骨架，只靠强大的黑暗魔法的意志来维持。",
	"Monstrous Forms. Dread beasts are typically many times larger than their living counterparts. This gigantism is often due to the fact that dread beasts are frequently created from the remains of legendary mythic beasts. However, others are an amalgamation of multiple mundane animals. For example, many dread wolves have been stitched together from the flesh of entire packs.": "怪异的形式。恐惧兽通常比它们活着的同类要大很多倍。这种巨大性通常是由于恐惧兽经常是由传说中的神话兽的遗骸创造出来的。然而，也有一些是多种世俗动物的混合体。例如，许多可怕的狼是由整个狼群的肉体拼接而成的。",
	"Tenacious Hunters. Some dread beasts are bound directly as servants of Lutheria and stand as guardians of things that the Titan holds dear. Others behave like revenants, hunting down and slaughtering their killers. Those created from mythic beasts are more likely to exhibit the latter behavior, frequently harassing heroes and adventuring parties.": "顽强的狩猎者。一些可怕的野兽直接被束缚为卢瑟亚的仆人，并作为泰坦所珍视的事物的守护者而存在。其他的则像复仇者一样，追捕并屠杀他们的杀手。那些由神话中的魔兽创造出来的魔兽更有可能表现出后一种行为，经常骚扰英雄和冒险队伍。",

A bite from one of these monster drains the life force from its victim, and the resulting wound is highly susceptible to infection—assuming the victim survives the encounter.": "枯萎的大嘴。一个可怕的野兽可以利用维持它的坏死能量向它的敌人猛烈攻击。被这种怪物咬上一口就会耗尽受害者的生命力，所造成的伤口极易被感染--如果受害者能在这场战斗中幸存的话。",

Dread boar often haunt cemeteries where they desecrate the tombs and grave markers of mortals who have displeased their mistress.": "可怕的野猪通常是由传说中的大野猪的残骸创造出来的，它们在地下世界的平原和文明的边缘蹒跚前进。尽管大野猪仍然比一般的世俗野猪更聪明，但当它们变成可怕的野兽时，它们的狡猾就被剥夺了，只剩下以前的躯壳。可怕的野猪经常在墓地出没，它们亵渎那些让它们的女主人不高兴的凡人的坟墓和墓碑。",
	"Traveling Miasma. The stench that cloaks a dread boar is even stronger than of other dread beasts. This is partly due to the creature's filthy, gore-caked tusks. Rather than being relegated solely to the creature's mouth, the necrotic black discharge that makes a dread beast's bite so deadly oozes continuously over the dread boar's deadly tusks.": "旅行瘴气。笼罩在可怕野猪身上的恶臭比其他可怕的野兽还要强烈。这部分是由于这种生物肮脏的、沾满血肉的獠牙。使得无畏兽的咬合力如此致命的坏死黑色分泌物并不是只存在于生物的嘴里，而是不断地渗入无畏野猪致命的獠牙中。",
	"Voracious Appetites. Dread boar are driven by an insatiable hunger that is a far greater threat to the civilized world than their murderous tempers. A single dread boar can devour entire fields of crops and herds of livestock in a matter of hours. If left unchecked and allowed to encroach upon humanoid settlements, a dread boar makes short work of all available food stores, leaving the residents to starve. Lutheria sometimes personally sends these creatures to plague prosperous cities she believes have not offered her adequate sacrifices.": "贪婪的胃口。可怕野猪被一种贪得无厌的饥饿感所驱使，这对文明世界的威胁远远大于它们凶残的脾气。一头可怕的野猪可以在几个小时内吞噬整个农田的作物和牲畜群。如果不加控制，任由它们侵占人类定居点，可畏野猪会在短时间内吃掉所有可用的食物储存，让居民挨饿。卢瑟亚有时会亲自派这些生物去祸害那些她认为没有为她提供足够祭品的繁荣城市。",

	"Dread Wolf": "恐惧的狼",

	"Glare of the Grave. The baleful glow of a dread wolf's eyes has the power to shake the nerves of even the most valiant warrior. This is not merely a reaction to the creature's repulsive appearance but rather a manifestation of the dread wolf's inner malevolence. The dread wolf is therefore able to use this ability at the most opportune time, focusing its enmity to invoke great fear in only its chosen targets.": "坟墓之光。恶狼眼睛的可怕光芒有能力撼动最英勇的战士的神经。这不仅仅是对生物令人厌恶的外表的反应，而是可怕的狼的内在恶意的表现。因此，可怕的狼能够在最合适的时候使用这种能力，集中它的敌意，只在它选择的目标中唤起巨大的恐惧。",
	"Strange Origins. Although most dread wolves have been fashioned from the corpses of ordinary wolves, humanoids are occasionally selected to transform into these creatures upon death.

	"Divine Construction. The rarity of these magnificent constructs is due to the fact that their completion is impossible without divine aid. Mortal attempts at building these marvels results in nothing more than articulated statues that are unable to move due to their own immense weight. As a result, it is common for a colossus to be sculpted in the likeness of its patron deity. This may be done to gain the favor or attention of the god, or it may be done at the god's request.": "神圣的建筑。这些宏伟的建筑之所以罕见，是因为没有神的帮助，它们不可能完成。凡人试图建造这些奇迹的结果不过是铰接的雕像，由于其自身巨大的重量而无法移动。因此，巨像通常会被雕刻成其守护神的模样。这样做可能是为了获得神的青睐或关注，也可能是应神的要求。",
	"Ambitious artificers should be aware that depicting a god has backfired at least once in history. It is said that a god once took offense at an artificer's clumsy depiction of his features. Enraged, the god cursed the colossus, creating a titanic engine of destruction that leveled the city that it was intended to protect.": "雄心勃勃的工匠们应该意识到，在历史上，对神的描绘至少有一次会适得其反。据说有一次，一位神对一位工匠笨拙地描绘他的特征表示不满。神被激怒了，诅咒了巨像，创造了一个巨大的毁灭引擎，把它原本要保护的城市夷为平地。",
	"Activation. A colossus remains dormant until activated by a command word. Sometimes the command word requires someone from a specific royal bloodline to speak it. The colossus will attack anything that is identified as an enemy by whoever awakened it. The colossus can also be directly controlled from a control room located inside its head. This set of controls typcally requires the user to possess a specific device, such as a rod of rulership, before the colossus can be given orders. Such devices are often royal heirlooms.": "激活。巨像一直处于休眠状态，直到被一个命令词激活。有时，这个命令词需要来自特定皇室血统的人说出。巨像会攻击任何被唤醒它的人认定为敌人的东西。巨像也可以从位于其头部的控制室中直接控制。这套控制装置通常要求使用者拥有一个特定的设备，比如统治棒，然后才能给巨像下达命令。这种设备通常是皇家的传家宝。",

Aside from its colossal size, the physical trait that most distinguishes a cetus from a normal shark are the multiple rows of wicked serrated teeth that extend the entire length of its gullet. Like those of a shark, a cetus's teeth gradually move forward and continuously replace its front teeth, which are frequently shed. Once separated, these teeth remain exquisitely sharp and are often used as spearheads by tool-using people in and around the ocean.

	"Goatlings are fond of employing irony and twisted humor when setting their deadly traps. One common tactic of goatling tricksters is to use the cries of a human infant as a lure, though the \"infant\" is really a polymorphed compatriot. Sometimes the transformed goatling remains disguised during the tribe's attack, but the goatlings particularly enjoy the reveal of having the infant show its true form just as a mortal victim succumbs to their cruel attacks.": "山羊精们在设置致命的陷阱时，喜欢采用讽刺和扭曲的幽默。山羊精诡计多端的一个常见策略是用人类婴儿的哭声作为诱饵，尽管这个 \"婴儿 \"实际上是一个多面体的同胞。有时，变身后的山羊精在部落的攻击中仍然保持着伪装，但山羊精们特别喜欢在凡人受害者屈服于他们残忍的攻击时，让婴儿露出真面目。",
	"Magical Tricksters. A few goatlings in every tribe, usually first-generation children who aren't affected by inbreeding, develop innate magical abilities.

These agents of chaos now follow the gods and arch-fey of madness, lust, and pleasure. All aspects of the maenad's previous personality are replaced by mania and desire.

	"Ritual Transformation. Humans rarely become \"raving ones\" by choice. Instead, the transformation is thrust upon them by powerful chaotic entities, often in the guise of mentors or teachers. The magic used to create a maenad typically comes from a strong bond to a lover, friend, or trusted elder. In the most common ritual, innocent young women are tricked or forced into consuming the flesh of a loved one. Others have become maenads after prayers to cure a dying loved one were cruelly answered. One particularly sadistic method of creating a maenad is to charm a victim and force her to beat a loved one to death with a fennel staff. The most benign method of transformation is as a punishment for the sins of another—when a loved one refuses to worship a god of madness or pleasure.": "仪式的转变。人类很少通过选择成为 \"狂热者\"。相反，这种转变是由强大的混乱实体强加给他们的，通常是以导师或老师的身份出现。用来创造女妖的魔法通常来自于与情人、朋友或可信赖的长者的强烈联系。在最常见的仪式中，无辜的年轻女性被欺骗或被迫吞食所爱之人的肉体。还有一些人在祈祷治愈垂死的亲人并得到残酷的回应后成为女妖。一种特别残忍的创造女妖的方法是迷惑受害者，强迫她用茴香杖将亲人打死。最良性的转化方法是作为对他人罪孽的惩罚--当所爱之人拒绝崇拜疯狂之神或快乐之神。",
	"Loathed by the Fey. Despite being fey creatures themselves, maenads are largely reviled by other fey due to the taint of mortality they carry. Maenads also frequently succeed in wooing satyrs away from less debauched fey lovers by pandering to their penchant for hedonism. These unions lead to the production of monstrous goatling offspring, who are as disliked as their mothers because of their relative weakness and connection to mortals. Maenads are especially abhorrent to non-evil fey due to the depraved and gruesome rituals that create them.": "被费伊人所厌恶。尽管女祭司本身也是费伊生物，但由于他们身上带有死亡的污点，在很大程度上被其他费伊人所唾弃。女祭司还经常通过迎合萨提尔的享乐主义嗜好，成功地将萨提尔从不那么放荡的费伊人的身边招揽过来。这些结合导致了畸形的山羊精后代的产生，由于他们的相对软弱和与凡人的联系，他们和他们的母亲一样被人厌恶。由于创造他们的堕落和可怕的仪式，Maenads对非邪恶的fey来说特别可憎。",

Clever individuals who find themselves confronted by maenads may be able to use their individual tastes to turn the creatures against each other. That might allow for an escape. Otherwise, the maenads will gleefully tear apart hapless trespassers.": "追求快乐。Maenads体现了全身心的享乐主义，对其他事物没有什么耐心。他们绝对专注于追求各种形式的快乐，包括疯狂的虐待狂。虽然渴望参与任何类型的狂欢，但一些maenads可能有一个首选的放纵，如食物或酒。聪明的人发现自己与女祭司面对面时，可能会利用他们各自的口味，让这些生物互相攻击。这可能会让你逃过一劫。否则，女祭司会兴高采烈地撕碎无助的闯入者。",

Closer inspection, however, reveals a creature that could not possibly be mistaken as such. The nuckle resembles a rotting corpse with its humanoid lower torso fused to the back of an equine form that makes up the majority of the creature's body. A single oversized eye stares out from the center of the nuckle's bulbous head, and it grasps at its victims with clawed hands attached to spindly, too-long arms.

Although the sea is the creature's true home, the nuckle regularly rises from the depths to plague coastal cities and towns, bringing death and misfortune in its wake. A nuckle's preferred manner of attack is to grab a victim and drag them into the sea on its back in a manner that makes the victim appear to be riding into the water on horseback. The nuckle may disappear beneath the waves for years at a time, only to rise and wreak havoc during a months-long rampage.": "泰坦的祸害。据说，纽扣是由死亡女神卢瑟亚（Lutheria）创造的，其唯一的目的是萦绕在文明世界，折磨那些居住在其中的人。虽然海洋是这种生物的真正家园，但纽克尔经常从深处升起，困扰着沿海城市和城镇，带来死亡和不幸。nuckle的首选攻击方式是抓住受害者，用它的背把他们拖进海里，这种方式使受害者看起来像是骑着马进入水中。nuckle可能会在海浪下消失数年之久，只是在长达数月的横冲直撞中才会浮出水面并造成破坏。",

However, this ability weakens the farther it strays from the sea. Brave heroes wishing to vanquish a nuckle often lure it as far inland as possible by burning seaweed. The stench of the resulting smoke has the power to enrage the nuckle to the point where it abandons all sense of self-preservation, as it is driven to find the source.
