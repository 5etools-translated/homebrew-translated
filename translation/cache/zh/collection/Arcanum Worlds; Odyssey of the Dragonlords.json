	"Marble golems are usually sculpted to resemble beautiful heroes and rulers from ages past.

There are rumors that evil wizards resort to petrifying beautiful youths to get the materials they need for construction.": "大理石雕像通常被雕刻成过去的美丽英雄和统治者的样子。建造它们的巫师需要伟大的工匠的服务，因为石像的特征必须非常逼真，才能使动画的魔法生效。有传言说，邪恶的巫师为了得到他们所需的建筑材料，不惜将美丽的年轻人石化。",
	"Aesthetic Guardians. Marble golems are usually set to guard areas where aesthetic beauty is desired—temples, palaces, libraries, or estates. Marble golems can be disguised as normal statues, but they come alive under certain conditions. For example, it might attack trespassers who enter a room without speaking the proper password.

	"Narcissistic Spirits. Marble golems are animated by spirits plucked from the elemental planes and forcibly bound into artificial bodies. The spirits unwittingly attracted to these particular constructs are always vain, and golem builders take advantage of their conceited natures when weaving the necessary binding spells. As long as the spirit finds its new form and surroundings suitably beautiful, it is much less likely to break free from its master's control. Great care is therefore given to ensuring that marble golems are displayed in such a way that their beauty is emphasized and respected.": "自恋的精神。大理石雕像是由从元素界挖来的灵魂激活的，并被强行捆绑在人造身体上。不知不觉中被吸引到这些特殊构造中的灵魂总是虚荣的，而巨石像的建造者在编织必要的束缚咒语时利用了他们自负的天性。只要精神发现它的新形式和周围环境适当地美丽，它就不太可能挣脱其主人的控制。因此，人们非常注意确保大理石雕像的展示方式，以强调和尊重它们的美。",

	"Free-Spirited Nomads. Centaurs do not create permanent settlements and instead constantly roam, setting up new temporary camps wherever the hunting is best. They look to the stars to determine when it is time to move on to new pastures. Living off of game and the occasional foraging, centaurs find the concept of agriculture very strange. Such practices require becoming rooted to one place, and they view the domestication of animals to be a complete perversion of nature.": "自由奔放的游牧者。半人马不建立永久的定居点，而是不断地漫游，在狩猎条件好的地方建立新的临时营地。他们仰望星空，以确定什么时候该搬到新的牧场。半人马以猎物和偶尔的觅食为生，发现农业的概念非常奇怪。这种做法需要扎根于一个地方，而且他们认为驯化动物是对自然的完全颠倒。",

	"Centaur history reaches back to long before the arrival of the settler races. When the first settlers arrived, the centaur tribes were largely indifferent to their presence. But during the First War, the Dragonlords and the Five Gods struck devastating blows against the centaur tribes. This has resulted in long-lasting enmity. Consequently, for the past several centuries, the centaurs have increasingly sought to drive the trespassing settler races out of Thylea by any means necessary.": "半人马的历史可以追溯到定居者种族到来之前很久。当第一批定居者到达时，半人马部落对他们的存在基本无动于衷。但在第一次战争中，龙王和五神对半人马部落进行了毁灭性的打击。这导致了长期的敌意。因此，在过去的几个世纪里，半人马越来越多地试图通过任何必要的手段将入侵的定居种族赶出蒂勒亚。",

	"Something to Prove. Despite their almost comical appearance, blemys are formidable foes. Underestimating their capabilities can lead to an untimely death. A blemys that does not receive due and proper deference from weaker creatures will demonstrate its giant strength by tearing such disrespectful foes apart. Blemys are frequently assumed to be unintelligent due to their lack of a cranium, and many non-blemys believe, incorrectly, that they are literally brainless. In fact, blemys are the most intelligent type of cyclops. They can outwit the average mortal settler, just as they outwitted their civilized cousins, the gygans, in ages past. The best strategy to avoid conflict with a blemys is to challenge it to a battle of wits. Letting the blemys win and then begging for mercy may be flattering enough for it to spare the loser's life. If a blemys is beaten by an obviously superior intellect, its humiliation will likely drive it to attack in a fit of rage. In such situations, opponents can take advantage of the blemys' limited field of view. If a dexterous and observant individual avoids the blemys' extreme tunnel vision for long enough, then it may be convinced that its quarry has escaped and give up its search in tearful frustration.": "需要证明的东西。尽管漂泊者的外表几乎是滑稽的，但他们是可怕的敌人。低估它们的能力会导致它们的不幸死亡。一个没有从弱小生物那里得到应有的和适当的尊重的blemys，会通过把这些不尊重的敌人撕碎来显示其巨大的力量。由于没有头颅，人们经常认为斑纹鱼没有智慧，许多非斑纹鱼的人错误地认为它们真的没有大脑。事实上，blemys是剑水蚤中最聪明的类型。它们可以智取一般的凡人定居者，就像它们在过去的年代里智取它们的文明表亲--吉甘人一样。避免与blemys发生冲突的最佳策略是向它挑战，进行一场智慧的较量。让blemys赢，然后求饶，可能会让它受宠若惊，从而饶过失败者的性命。如果漂泊者被明显具有优势的智力击败，它的羞辱很可能会促使它在愤怒中进行攻击。在这种情况下，对手可以利用blemys的有限视野。如果一个灵巧的、善于观察的人躲避出血虫的极端隧道视野足够长的时间，那么它可能会相信它的猎物已经逃脱，并在流泪的沮丧中放弃搜寻。",
	"Nomadic Lifestyle. Blemys' prickly personalities and antisocial tendencies prevent these creatures from forming communities. They live by raiding poorly-defended settlements for food and other goods, and given the opportunity, they may even steal from their own kindred. As a result, blemys often find themselves wandering alone, as they are quickly driven from an area once survivors of their raids recover and organize.": "游牧的生活方式。Blemys的多刺性格和反社会倾向使这些生物无法形成社区。它们靠袭击防御薄弱的定居点获取食物和其他物品为生，如果有机会，它们甚至可能偷窃自己的同类。因此，漂泊者经常发现自己在独自徘徊，因为一旦袭击的幸存者恢复并组织起来，他们很快就会被赶出一个地区。",
	"Uncertain Origins. The origin of these outlandish cyclopes is unknown. Some scholars believe that their condition is a divine curse. Blemys progenitors may have comprised a civilization of particularly intelligent, charismatic, and social cyclopes that were uncharacteristically prone to vanity. This, possibly combined with the nonreligious nature of most cyclopes, attracted the attention of cruel gods who decided to punish them for their pride and narcissism. Robbed of their good looks and affluence, the blemys' civilization quickly collapsed, driving their descendants into lonely lives of perpetual dissatisfaction.": "不确定的起源。这些怪异的独眼巨人的起源不详。一些学者认为，他们的状况是一种神圣的诅咒。Blemys的祖先可能是由一群特别聪明、有魅力、善于交际的独眼巨人组成的文明，他们一反常态地容易产生虚荣心。这可能与大多数独眼巨人的非宗教性质相结合，吸引了残忍的神的注意，他们决定惩罚他们的骄傲和自恋。由于被剥夺了俊美的外表和富裕的生活，漂泊者的文明很快就崩溃了，使他们的后代陷入了永远不满足的孤独生活。",

With the decline of their once great civilization, gygans now live together in small family groups or sometimes alone.": "吉冈人是六臂巨人，只有一只眼睛。据传，他们是一个古老的独眼巨人种族的后裔，这个种族是由诸神催生的，在几千年前就已经繁荣起来了。他们的城邦文明以拳击和摔跤为重点，在伟大的游戏竞赛中竞争。有时这些游戏可能会演变成彻底的战争。随着他们曾经的伟大文明的衰落，吉普赛人现在以小型家庭团体的形式生活在一起，有时也独自生活。",
	"Civilized. Unlike typical cyclopes, gygans echo their once-great civilization in their current lives. Instead of a city-state comprised of a single grand metropolis and the surrounding area, the gygans of today form groups based around a powerful family. A gygan community begins with a grand founder family estate that is built up over time, that attracts solitary gygans and mates from other family groups. These newcomers construct their own homes nearby, creating patches of relatively secure farmland between estates. Gygans within these family groups cooperate to produce food, wine, clothing, art, and entertainment. These self-sustaining communities rarely interact with non-gygans. Consequently, each insular family group develops a distinct culture that may be lost completely if disaster strikes the community. Some gygan family groups have become so isolated that their members speak dialects not intelligible to other speakers of giant or common, including other gygans in the same area.": "文明的。与典型的独眼巨人不同，吉普赛人在他们目前的生活中呼应他们曾经的伟大文明。今天的吉普赛人不是由一个单一的大都市和周边地区组成的城邦，而是以一个强大的家族为基础形成群体。一个gygan社区开始于一个宏伟的创始人家族庄园，随着时间的推移，它吸引了孤独的gygan人和来自其他家族团体的伴侣。这些新来者在附近建造自己的家园，在庄园之间创造了一些相对安全的农田。这些家族群体中的吉普赛人合作生产食物、酒、服装、艺术和娱乐。这些自我维持的社区很少与非吉普赛人交流。因此，每个孤立的家庭团体发展出一种独特的文化，如果灾难降临到社区，可能会完全丧失。一些吉甘家族群体已经变得如此孤立，以至于他们的成员所讲的方言无法被其他讲巨人或普通话的人所理解，包括同一地区的其他吉甘人。",

	"Enchanting Melodies. A keledone's greatest weapon is her magnificent voice, which has the power to evoke both soothing comfort and haunting despair in all who hear it. One of her songs dredges up and intensifies a listener's most sorrowful memories, which may break the psyche of those with lesser wills. Another tune lulls a keledone's aggressors into a deep sleep. Depending upon the severity of her victim's transgression, a keledone may continue her somnolent song long enough that her target dies of dehydration.

	"Mechanical Will. The keledone are intelligent constructs imbued with a self-awareness that is rare among automatons.
