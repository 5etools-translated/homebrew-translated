If the attack hits and the target is a spellcaster, the target loses its highest level unused spell slot and the ooze regains hit points equal to 5 times the slot level.": "敖包对它正在抓捕的大型或小型目标进行一次溶化攻击。如果攻击命中，且目标是施法者，则目标会失去其最高等级的未使用的法术槽，而敖包会重新获得相当于法术槽等级5倍的命中率。",
	"The crackling, green protoplasm of an arcane ooze spells terror for magic users. The arcane ooze seeks out and devours arcane energy, ignoring any other targets that might be in the area. Some wizards fear that one day, arcane oozes will consume all the magic in the world, ending wizardry forever.": "噼里啪啦的绿色原生质对魔法使用者来说是一种恐怖。奥术渗出物寻找并吞噬奥术能量，无视可能在该区域的任何其他目标。一些巫师担心，有一天，奥术渗出物会吞噬世界上所有的魔法，永远结束巫术。",
	"If that were to happen, however, some would claim that it was a self-inflicted demise. There is no proof, but widespread conjecture suggest that the first arcane oozes were created by a group of wizards deliberately, as a weapon to be deployed against a rival group. If so, they definitely got more than what they bargained for.": "然而，如果发生这种情况，有人会声称这是一种自取灭亡的行为。没有证据，但广泛的猜测表明，第一批奥术渗出物是由一群巫师故意创造的，作为对付敌对团体的武器。如果是这样，他们得到的肯定比他们讨价还价的要多。",
	"Oozes defy the conventions of other living things. Even without organs, skin, senses, or any discernible anatomy, oozes thrive where other creatures would starve by having a simple, yet effective survival strategy: envelop and digest anything within reach.": "渗水虫违背了其他生物的惯例。即使没有器官、皮肤、感官或任何可辨认的解剖结构，在其他生物会饿死的地方，渗水虫也能茁壮成长，因为它们有一个简单而有效的生存策略：包住并消化任何可触及的东西。",

Oozes are mindless, acting on rudimentary instinct to find and consume.": "与霉菌和真菌很相似的是，渗出物在黑暗、潮湿的空间里茁壮成长。它们在黑暗中徘徊，没有耳朵和眼睛，只靠振动来寻找运动和可能的猎物。渗水虫是无意识的，依靠基本的本能来寻找和吞噬。",
	"In a fiendishly clever adaptation, oozes require no special method to digest eat or digest; they simply envelop organic material into their bodies and slowly dissolve it. The entire ooze is digestive–a mass of acidic slime that can break down any organic thing into its component parts, given enough time. Different oozes can digest different materials, but all oozes can liquefy an adventurer.": "在一个狡猾的适应过程中，渗水体不需要特殊的方法来消化吃或消化；它们只是把有机物包在自己的身体里，慢慢地将其溶解。整个渗水体都是消化性的--一团酸性粘液，只要有足够的时间，就能把任何有机物分解成其组成部分。不同的渗水体可以消化不同的材料，但所有的渗水体都可以使冒险者液化。",

If a place seems too clean, it might be swept routinely by a patrolling ooze.": "奥兹人在不知不觉中参与了数十个古墓的防御工作。资深冒险家警告说，不应该相信腐朽的古墓中整洁的道路。如果一个地方看起来太干净，可能是被巡逻的渗水者例行扫荡过。",
	"Moreover, a hapless ooze might compound the deadliness of an already hazardous trap. A routine pit fall is made downright lethal when a black pudding has already fallen down its bottom.": "此外，一个无能的渗出物可能会加重已经很危险的陷阱的致命性。当一个黑布丁已经掉到坑底时，一个普通的坑就变得非常致命了。",
	"Fortunately for adventurers, the slow death an ooze provides affords greater opportunity for rescue. It's far easier to pull someone from the belly of an ooze than it is to pull them from the belly of a dragon, after all.": "幸运的是，对于冒险者来说，渗水的缓慢死亡为救援提供了更大的机会。毕竟，把人从渗水的肚子里拉出来要比把他们从龙的肚子里拉出来容易得多。",

	"A chilling fog is an unusual species of ooze that arises spontaneously on a battlefield the day after a great battle has been fought.

	"The noxious mustard jelly is less common than its yellow cousin, the ochre jelly, but the two are found in the same general environments. Encountering both species at once is an adventurer's worst nightmare, as one is immune to swords and axes - and the other spears and arrows.

	"{@atk rw} {@hit +5} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h} 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage and the target must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw.

	"An industrial accident was responsible for the creation of slime people: small, amorphous folks with stubby little arms and a surprisingly militaristic culture. Now, nations of slime people colonize the dank corners of the world, thriving in sewerage systems, undersea caverns and rotten swamps. They are generally benign and friendly with other humanoids, since they are not competing for the same territory or resources, but anyone who believes their soft bodies might make them pushovers will find themselves sorely mistaken.": "一场工业事故导致了粘液人的诞生：他们个头小，无定形，有着粗壮的小臂和令人惊讶的军国主义文化。现在，粘液人的国家在世界的阴暗角落里定居，在下水道系统、海底洞穴和腐烂的沼泽地里繁衍生息。他们通常对其他人类友好，因为他们不争夺相同的领土或资源，但任何认为他们柔软的身体可能会使他们变得软弱的人都会发现自己大错特错。",

	"The glitter disappears 1 minute after being conjured.": "熠熠生辉的东西在被召唤出来1分钟后就会消失。",
	"The god that you worship is bizarre, and forgotten to almost all in the realms of men. Gods of Slime are often nameless, churning deities of filth, possessing no temples and few if any worshippers. It is, therefore, a mystery wherefore their immense power originates. Scholars of divinity speculate that, perhaps, the Slime Domain naturally occurs as a result of other gods' waste. Or perhaps, oozes themselves, in spite of being unintelligent in every conceivable sense, still possess the capability to worship at some level, and therefore empower these nameless gods.": "你所崇拜的神很奇怪，几乎被人界的所有人遗忘。粘液之神通常是无名的，搅动污秽的神灵，没有庙宇，如果有崇拜者，也很少。因此，他们巨大的力量是如何产生的，这是一个谜。神学学者们推测，也许，史莱姆领域是由于其他神的浪费而自然产生的。也可能，尽管在所有可想而知的意义上，渗出物本身是没有智慧的，但它们仍然拥有某种程度的崇拜能力，因此赋予这些无名的神灵以力量。",
	"At 1st level, you learn the {@spell acid splash} and {@spell poison spray} cantrips, which count as cleric cantrips for you.": "一级时，你学会了（%0%）和（%1%）的咒语，这些咒语对你来说算作牧师的咒语。",

	"Additionally, when you cast a spell which deals acid damage to a target, it takes an additional 1d4 acid damage. If the target carries or wears either metal armor or a metal shield, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one metal armor or shield of your choice takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.": "此外，当你施展一个对目标造成酸性伤害的法术时，它将受到额外的1d4酸性伤害。如果目标携带或穿戴金属盔甲或金属盾牌，它必须做一个灵巧的救赎动作。如果救赎失败，你选择的一件金属盔甲或盾牌会对其提供的攻击力产生永久的、累积的-1惩罚。降低到AC值10的盔甲或下降到+0奖励的盾牌会被摧毁。",

An ooze whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect.": "在第2级时，作为一个行动，你可以尝试指挥你周围30英尺范围内你能看到的海怪。在接下来的24小时内，或者在你再次使用这个通道神性的选项之前，这只敖包必须进行智慧救赎或服从你的命令。一个挑战等级等于或大于你的等级的敖包对这个效果免疫。",
	"While an ooze is under your command, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to mentally command it if it is within 60 feet of you.

	"At 6th level, you can secrete slime from your skin and orifices as an action. For the next minute, you have advantage on checks against being grappled and, when a creature within your reach hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal {@damage 3d6} acid damage to it.": "在6级时，你可以从你的皮肤和口中分泌粘液作为一个动作。在接下来的一分钟里，你对被抓捕的检查有优势，并且，当一个在你范围内的生物用近身攻击击中你时，你可以用你的反应对它造成{@damage 3d6}酸液伤害。",
	"At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy.

	"Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to summon a {@creature gelatinous cube|MM} to envelop your enemies. Choose a space you can see within 120 feet for the cube to appear. If you summon the cube into a creature's space, the creature is subject to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. You can command the cube as with your Rebuke Ooze feature.": "从17级开始，你可以用你的行动召唤一个（%0%）来笼罩你的敌人。在120英尺内选择一个你能看到的空间，让立方体出现。如果你将立方体召唤到一个生物的空间中，该生物会受到立方体的吞噬作用，并且在蓄力动作上处于劣势。你可以用你的 \"叱咤风云 \"功能来指挥这个立方体。",
	"The cube's maximum hit points are increased by twice your level, and, if cube calls for a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC instead.": "方块的最大命中率会增加两倍于你的等级，而且如果方块要求蓄力，它会用你的法术蓄力DC代替。",
	"The cube vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit points, or after one hour. After using this ability to summon an ooze, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "如果方块的命中率降至0，或在一小时后消失。在使用这个能力来召唤敖包后，你不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Your innate magic stems from a long family line of Ooze blood. For generations, the taint of Ooze blood has run in your family, infecting some at birth and sparing others, stemming from a well-documented but shadowy ancestor. It's unclear what horrific experiment infused a monstrous ooze or slime into his body so long ago, but some of his scattered descendants are born to this day with a personal, innate magic and bizarre physical characteristics.": "你与生俱来的魔力来自于敖包血统的悠久家族血统。几代人以来，你的家族中都流淌着敖兹血统的污点，一些人一出生就被感染，另一些人则不受影响，这源于一位有据可查但不光彩的祖先。目前还不清楚是什么可怕的实验在很久以前给他的身体注入了可怕的渗水或粘液，但他的一些零散的后代至今仍带着个人的、天生的魔法和奇怪的身体特征出生。",
	"Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you can excrete slime with a touch. As an action, you can make a touch range spell attack at a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage. You can expend 1 sorcery point make this touch rust metal, or rot wood, up to a maximum of 10 cubic feet of material.

	"At 6th level, your body becomes more fluid. You can shift your features around and make yourself look differently while you maintain concentration on the change.

Otherwise, the extent of the physical change is up to you.": "在第6级，你的身体变得更加流畅。你可以在保持注意力集中在变化上的同时，将你的五官移来移去，让自己看起来不一样。你可以看起来矮一英尺或高一英尺，可以看起来很瘦，很胖，或者在两者之间。你不能改变你的体型，所以你必须采用一种具有相同的四肢基本排列的形式。否则，身体变化的程度由你决定。",
	"Additionally, you can expend 2 sorcery points to compress your body enough to squeeze through an inch-wide crack. You cannot expand inside a space that offers any resistance, such as an occupied suit of armor.": "此外，你可以消耗2个巫术点来压缩你的身体，足以挤过一英寸宽的裂缝。你不能在有任何阻力的空间内扩张，例如一件被占用的盔甲。",
	"By 14th level, your blood flows like a thick soup rather than a normal liquid.
