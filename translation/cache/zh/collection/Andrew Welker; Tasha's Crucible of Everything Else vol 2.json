	"Bards of the College of the Requiem, often called lamenters, eulogists, or requiem singers, regardless of whether or not their requiem involves any singing, dedicate themselves to all things pertaining to death. This branches out into several different paths as some prefer funerary rites, while others keep the unnatural undead at bay. Other requiem singers still, have been known to turn this power to the bolstering of undeath, and as such, you can even see requiem singers in the armies of evil rulers that rely on the dead to bolster their ranks.": "安魂曲学院的吟游诗人，通常被称为哀歌者、悼念者或安魂曲歌手，无论他们的安魂曲是否涉及任何歌唱，他们都致力于所有与死亡有关的事情。这其中有几条不同的道路，因为有些人喜欢丧葬仪式，而有些人则把非自然的亡灵放在一边。还有一些安魂曲演唱者将这种力量用于支持不死之身，因此，你甚至可以在邪恶统治者的军队中看到安魂曲演唱者，他们依靠死者来壮大自己的队伍。",

However, the Golgari and Orzhov guilds wouldn't be too far a stretch for one of this college as well.": "在拉夫尼卡这个行会之城，最有可能让成员转向这种特别小众的音乐风格的行会是拉克多斯。长期以来，音乐一直是恶魔嘉年华的一部分，而带领死人唱歌跳舞就像狰狞的木偶一样，非常符合拉克多斯的幽默感。然而，戈尔加里和奥尔乔夫公会也不会太过夸张，因为这所大学的一个人也是如此。",

	"Some have noted that as brilliant as Tasha is, there are some things that take her by surprise even now, a notion that she seems to generally enjoy. This undoubtedly stems from the fey influence in her upbringing, which emphasizes the thrill in both giving and receiving in jokes and tricks, and it is a known fact that Tasha could have a higher Intelligence if she wanted to. At the very least, there is a popular legend that says that she has more than one spare tome of clear thought lying around somewhere.": "有些人注意到，像塔莎这样聪明的人，即使现在也有一些事情让她大吃一惊，她似乎普遍喜欢这种观念。这无疑是源于她成长过程中的费伊影响，强调在笑话和技巧中给予和接受的快感，而且众所周知，如果塔莎愿意，她可以拥有更高的智力。至少，有一个流行的传说，说她有不止一本闲置的清晰思考的小册子躺在某个地方。",

If by some chance an adventurer does come into contact with one of her spellbooks, it should be noted that it is certainly only a copy, and likely an abridged one at that. Her comprehensive spellbook is surely hidden away on some transitional plane that only she can access, and likely one that only she knows about.": "就像任何通过学习掌握魔法的知名人士一样，塔莎有许多书，其中包含她的计算、公式和其他笔记；但她的书藏在整个多元宇宙中。其中许多都有凡人所知的每一个公开的咒语，然后还有一些，其中不确定的数量肯定包含她自己秘密创造的咒语。如果冒险者偶然接触到她的一本法术书，应该注意的是，这肯定只是一本副本，而且很可能是一本节略的副本。她的综合法术书肯定被藏在某个只有她能进入的过渡平面上，而且很可能是只有她知道的。",

When a mezzoloth wants to command as it is commanded, or a nycaloth wants to be served in the same way that it serves, miniloths are the most common solution. Occasionally, a warlock might be gifted a miniloth by its patron, a fiend might grant one as a part of a deal, or an inquiring mage might stumble upon one by accident. But more commonly, the miniloth will seek out figures that are powerful (at least in their eyes) to attach themselves to and act as a sycophant for, if given proper compensation.": "在yugoloths中，miniloths是最小的，也是最弱的，它是爪牙的爪牙。当梅索洛特人想要像它被命令一样进行指挥，或者尼卡洛特人想要以它服务的方式被服务时，迷你洛特人是最常见的解决方案。偶尔，一个术士可能会被它的赞助人赠予一个miniloth，一个恶魔可能会作为交易的一部分给予一个miniloth，或者一个好奇的法师可能会意外地发现一个miniloth。但更常见的是，如果得到适当的补偿，迷你蛾会寻找那些强大的人物（至少在他们眼里）来依附并充当他们的奸商。",
	"Miniloths are considered by those who know them to be some of the best underlings available, as they require only validation and recognition in return for their services. Miniloths know that they are small and weak, and are thus driven by an incessant hunger for reassurance. Most miniloths will carry out their duties for as long as they see that the figure they are employed by will acknowledge their services with exaggerated congratulations and expressions of confidence. Miniloths have even been known to decline enormous piles of treasure and withstand immense amounts of torture, not because the miniloth holds any real devotion to those it works for, but merely because they know that their loyalty will bring a shower of praises and exclamations of wonder upon their eventual return.": "认识他们的人认为米尼洛特人是现有的一些最好的下属，因为他们只需要用验证和认可来回报他们的服务。小兵们知道他们渺小而软弱，因此被一种对保证的不断渴望所驱使。只要他们看到受雇于他们的人物会以夸张的祝贺和自信的表达来承认他们的服务，大多数小兵就会履行他们的职责。据了解，迷你蛾甚至会拒绝巨大的财宝堆和承受巨大的折磨，这并不是因为迷你蛾对它的工作对象有任何真正的奉献，而只是因为他们知道他们的忠诚会在他们最终返回时带来阵阵赞美和惊叹声。",
	"While a miniloth's conditions are simple, they are not necessarily easy to meet. Small and fragile though they may be, their sense of trust is even weaker. Miniloths are viciously jealous, and this can have varying effects on the miniloth's services depending on the situation. If the miniloth feels socially threatened by other small and relatively insignificant creatures, then the miniloth will likely be spurred into taking greater lengths to win the superiors' attention and acknowledgement, drawing strength from the idea that they will be acclaimed above all the others in the end. But if the perceived threat comes from a creature that the miniloth fears it can never surpass, then the miniloth's attention-seeking tendencies turn to vile hatred, and the miniloth never forgets the spurning that it feels it has received. Miniloths rarely act out directly against these greater threats, but they are very likely to anonymously create minor inconveniences, mutter rude phrases under their breath, and the like. ": "虽然迷你蛾的条件很简单，但它们不一定容易满足。尽管他们可能是小而脆弱的，但他们的信任感更弱。迷你龙是恶毒的嫉妒者，这对迷你龙的服务会产生不同的影响，取决于情况。如果迷你牙人感到受到其他小型和相对微不足道的生物的社会威胁，那么迷你牙人很可能会被刺激到采取更大的努力来赢得上级的注意和认可，从他们最终会被赞誉为高于所有其他人的想法中汲取力量。但是，如果感知到的威胁来自于迷你蛾担心自己永远无法超越的生物，那么迷你蛾的关注倾向就会变成卑鄙的仇恨，迷你蛾永远不会忘记它觉得自己受到的唾弃。迷你蛾很少直接对这些更大的威胁采取行动，但它们很可能匿名地制造一些小麻烦，在口中嘟囔一些粗鲁的短语，等等。",
	"Miniloths are something of an enigma, and might cling to the vilest of characters and endure excessively harsh treatment merely for the smooth comments that they may receive. Miniloths sometimes even retain these relationships on the basis of hope that their master will come around soon and consequently express their appreciation with tearful thanks and bursting accolades. As much as a miniloth wants to be praised in the moment, it has the presence of mind to acknowledge consistency and eventuality so long as they are expected, but will not remain in a situation where it does not see a reward as an eventual likelihood. While the exact terms that spell the loss of a miniloth seem to depend on the individual miniloth to some degree, the most prominent factor appears to be whether or not there are other more powerful servants available. The presence of potentially more useful minions raises the possibility, in the mind of the miniloth, that it will be overlooked in favor of other alternatives. This causes them to be highly suspicious and constantly on edge, though they may not actually leave for some time.": "Miniloths是一个谜，他们可能会依附于最卑鄙的人物，并忍受过度苛刻的待遇，仅仅是为了他们可能收到的顺利评论。Miniloths有时甚至在希望他们的主人很快回心转意的基础上保留这些关系，并因此用含泪的感谢和爆裂的赞美来表达他们的感激。就像迷你蛾希望在当下得到赞美一样，只要是预期的，它就会有意识地承认一致性和偶发性，但不会停留在不认为奖励是最终可能的情况下。虽然拼凑出一个迷你牙的确切条款似乎在某种程度上取决于个别迷你牙，但最突出的因素似乎是是否有其他更强大的仆人可用。潜在的更有用的仆人的存在，在迷你蛾的心目中引起了一种可能性，那就是它将被忽略，而被其他替代品所取代。这导致他们高度怀疑，并不断提心吊胆，尽管他们可能在一段时间内不会真正离开。",
