	"A common misconception regarding traps is that their purpose is solely to inflict damage on characters. This is a very limited view. A trap that is blundered into, goes off, injures a few characters, and then is forgotten can be a wasted opportunity. The best traps are the ones that characters find and then spend time and brainpower trying to overcome in interesting ways, asking questions like: Can it be disabled? If not, can it be circumvented? Can its effect be minimized?": "关于陷阱的一个常见误解是，它们的目的仅仅是对角色造成伤害。这是一个非常有限的观点。一个被误入的陷阱，爆炸了，伤害了几个角色，然后就被遗忘了，这可能是一个浪费的机会。最好的陷阱是那些角色发现并花时间和脑力以有趣的方式去克服的陷阱，问的问题包括：\"它能被禁用吗？它可以被禁用吗？如果不能，能不能绕过它？能否将它的影响降到最低？",
	"One of our primary goals as storytellers is engagement, and traps can be an {@i excellent} tool for this! An adventuring party is made up of players who all have fun in different ways. As diverse as our players can be, so too are their characters, with different skills, proficiencies, and areas of expertise. Traps, when used well, can add to everyone's experience. A trap can allow a player to flex their roleplaying muscles or it can highlight a meticulously optimized character build. This book has hundreds of examples of ways to challenge players. When using them, consider the things your players enjoy, and what their characters can do, and use obstacles that play to these things. Be conscious of where they get invested, when they are having fun, and how they react. Give everyone opportunities to contribute and to overcome the challenges laid before them. This creates a satisfying experience for everyone.": "作为讲故事的人，我们的主要目标之一是参与，而陷阱可以是一个{@i excellent}的工具! 一个冒险团队是由玩家组成的，他们都以不同的方式获得乐趣。就像我们的玩家一样，他们的角色也是多种多样的，有不同的技能、熟练程度和专业领域。陷阱，如果使用得好，可以增加每个人的经验。一个陷阱可以让玩家发挥他们的角色扮演能力，也可以突出一个精心优化的角色构建。本书有数百个挑战玩家的例子。在使用这些例子时，考虑你的玩家喜欢什么，他们的角色能做什么，并使用能发挥这些作用的障碍。要注意他们在什么地方投入，什么时候有乐趣，以及他们如何反应。让每个人都有机会做出贡献，克服摆在他们面前的挑战。这将为每个人创造一个令人满意的体验。",

	"These are traps where either the trigger is magic and the effect is mundane, or vice versa.": "这些陷阱要么触发是魔法，效果是世俗的，要么反过来。",
	"Many of the magic and hybrid traps described in this book could be a {@spell glyph of warding} {@i (spell trap)} or the {@spell symbol} spell. These spells each have their own specific rules for detection and disarming. A {@spell glyph of warding} or {@spell symbol} can only be found with an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, using the caster's spell save DC, and can only be disabled with {@spell dispel magic}. You can use the DC determined by the trap's lethality, or if you knokw that an NPC wizard cast the spell you can use their spell save DC.": "本书中描述的许多魔法和混合陷阱都可以是（%0%）（%1%）或（%2%）的法术。这些法术在探测和解除方面都有自己的特定规则。{@spell glyph of warding}或{@spell symbol}只能通过智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查来发现，使用施法者的法术保存DC，并且只能用{@spell dispel magic}来解除。你可以使用由陷阱的致命性决定的DC，或者如果你知道一个NPC巫师施法，你可以使用他们的法术保存DC。",
	"As an optional rule you can allow a character to use a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to disable a {@spell glyph of warding} or {@spell symbol} as well as {@spell dispel magic}. When we present these kinds of traps throughout, we assume that this optional rule is in effect.": "作为一条可选的规则，你可以允许一个角色使用成功的智力（（%0%））检查来禁用一个（%1%）或（%2%）以及（%3%）。当我们在整个过程中介绍这类陷阱时，我们假定这个可选规则是有效的。",
	"Whether or not creatures can use {@skill Investigation} passively is up to you; if you decide to allow for passive {@skill Investigation} to discover a {@spell glyph of warding} that can make them less theatening. However, if a glyph can only be found with an active check, you might consider allowing for a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or leaving some clues in the trapped area to let the characters know that something might be hidden.": "生物是否能被动地使用（%0%）由你决定；如果你决定允许被动地（%1%）发现一个（%2%），可以使它们不那么紧张。然而，如果一个石刻只能通过主动检查来发现，你可以考虑允许进行智慧（（%3%））检查，或者在被困区域留下一些线索，让人物知道可能隐藏着什么。",
	"These kinds of taps combine mundane triggers and magic effects, or magic triggers and mundane effects, and this can lead to some interesting combinations. Hybrid traps can usually be detected with Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) or Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}), and they can also be found with {@spell detect magic}.": "这类陷阱结合了世俗的触发器和魔法效果，或者魔法触发器和世俗效果，这可以导致一些有趣的组合。混合型陷阱通常可以用智慧（（%0%））或智力（（%1%））检测出来，也可以用（%2%）发现。",
	"When a mundane trigger activates a magic effect, the trapped area or object is enchanted with a spell effect but just waiting for input from the trigger to complete the arcane circuit. When activated, the trap targets the creature that triggered it with the effect. If the trap affects an area, the area is centred on that creature. If the trap summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects, they appear as close as possible to the triggering and attack it. If the effect requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.": "当一个世俗的触发器激活一个魔法效果时，被困住的区域或物体被施以法术效果，但只是在等待触发器的输入以完成奥术回路。当被激活时，陷阱会以触发它的生物为目标，产生效果。如果陷阱影响到一个区域，该区域就以该生物为中心。如果陷阱召唤了敌对的生物或制造了有害的物体，它们会尽可能地出现在触发者身边并攻击它。如果该效果需要集中注意力，它将持续到其全部持续时间结束。",
	"When viewed with {@spell detect magic}, this kind of hybrid traps usually have an aura that reflects the school of magic for the effect. A trap that creates a blast of fire usually slows up with an evocation aura when looked at with {@spell detect magic}.": "当用{@spell detect magic}查看时，这种混合型陷阱通常有一个反映效果的魔法流派的光环。当用{@spell detect magic}查看时，一个能产生火焰爆炸的陷阱通常会有一个唤起光环来减速。",
	"If a magic trigger activates a mechanical effect, the trap usually has some sort of rune or sigil that acts as a detector. When activated, the rune creates a Tiny, {@condition invisible}, mindless, shapeless force that only lasts long enough to interact with the mechanical elements of the trap, setting off the mundane effect. If you'd like, you can add the following spell to your game to provide a way for spellcasters (usually sorcerers and wizards, or clerics of deities devoted to protection) to make these sorts of detectors.": "如果魔法触发器激活了机械效果，陷阱通常会有某种符文或符咒作为检测器。当被激活时，符文会产生一种微小的、（%0%）、无意识的、无形状的力量，这种力量只持续足够长的时间与陷阱的机械元素相互作用，从而引发世俗的效果。如果你愿意，你可以在你的游戏中加入以下咒语，为施法者（通常是巫师和魔法师，或致力于保护的神职人员）提供一种方法来制造这类探测器。",
	"When you cast this spell, you inscribe a rune upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall), or on an object. If you choose a surface, the rune can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the rune burns away, and the spell ends without being triggered.": "当你施展这个法术时，你会在一个表面（如桌子或一段地板或墙壁）或一个物体上刻下一个符文。如果你选择一个表面，符文可以覆盖该表面的一个直径不超过10英尺的区域。如果你选择一个物体，该物体必须留在原地；如果该物体从你施法的地方移动超过10英尺，符文就会被烧掉，并且咒语结束时不会被触发。",
	"You can hide the rune in a larger design, but the rune is visible and can be spotted with a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. With a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, a creature that spots the rune can erase a portion of it, ending the spell without triggering it. The DC for both these checks is your spell save DC.": "你可以将符文隐藏在更大的设计中，但符文是可见的，并且可以通过成功的智慧（（%0%））检查来发现。通过成功的智力检查，发现符文的生物可以抹去符文的一部分，结束咒语而不触发它。这两个检查的DC是你的法术保存DC。",
	"You decide what triggers the rune when you cast this spell. For rune inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the rune, removing another object covering the rune, approaching within a certain distance of the rune, or manipulating the object on which the rune is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed on an object, the most common triggers include approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the rune.": "你决定当你施展这个法术时什么会触发符文。对于刻在表面的符文，最典型的触发因素包括触摸或站在符文上，移除覆盖符文的其他物体，接近符文一定距离内，或操纵刻有符文的物体。对于刻在物体上的符文，最常见的触发因素包括接近该物体一定距离内，或看到或阅读该符文。",
	"You can further refine the trigger so the rune activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the rune, such as those who say a certain password.": "你可以进一步细化触发条件，使符文只在特定情况下或根据身体特征（如身高或体重）、生物种类（例如，可以将守护设置为影响畸形人或乌鸦）或排列组合而激活。你也可以为不触发符文的生物设置条件，比如说那些说出某种密码的生物。",
	"When the rune is triggered, it creates a Tiny, {@condition invisible}, mindless, shapeless force that only lasts long enough to interact with a nearby mechanical element, such as the workings of a trap, a lever, or a button. The mechanical element must be within 10 feet of the rune. Once the force interacts in this way, the spell ends and the rune fades away.": "当符文被触发时，它会产生一种微小的、{@condition invisible}、无意识的、无形状的力量，只持续足够长的时间与附近的机械元素互动，例如陷阱、杠杆或按钮的运作。该机械元素必须在符文的10英尺范围内。一旦这种力量以这种方式相互作用，咒语就会结束，符文就会消失。",
	"The pre-made traps in this book are arranged by level and lethality. These are used to together to determine things such as the variables of the trap, such as appropriate damage output, spell level, duration of effects, and (if needed) appropriate experience reward.": "本书中的预制陷阱是按等级和致命性排列的。这些都是用来确定陷阱的变量的，如适当的伤害输出、法术等级、效果持续时间和（如果需要）适当的经验奖励。",
	"A trap's level is expressed as one of five ranges: 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, and 17-20. An appropriate trap will be in the range that includes the average level of your characters.": "陷阱的级别表示为五个范围之一。1-4，5-8，9-12，13-16，和17-20。一个合适的陷阱将在包括你的角色的平均水平的范围内。",
	"Variable statistics of a given trap, such as attack bonus, the DC for a saving throw to resist its effects or an ability check to overcome it, and the damage it deals all depend on the trap's lethality. A trap intended to be a {@b setback} is unlikely to seriously harm the characters of the indicated levels, but a {@b moderate} trap likely will. A {@b dangerous} trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels and a {@b perilous} trap almost definitely will. A {@b deadly} trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.": "一个给定的陷阱的可变统计数据，如攻击奖励、抵抗其效果的蓄力或克服它的能力检查的DC，以及它造成的伤害都取决于该陷阱的致命性。一个意图为{@b setback}的陷阱不太可能严重伤害指定等级的角色，但一个{@b moderate}的陷阱可能会。一个{@b dangerous}的陷阱可能会严重伤害（并有可能杀死）指定等级的人物，而一个{@b perilous}的陷阱几乎肯定会。一个{@b deadly}的陷阱可能会杀死指定等级的人物。",
	"A trap's purpose keyword describes its primary usage in the area, including the reasoning behind its placement and the overall goal of the trap. Some traps may do more than one of the following, but their primary purpose is reflected in the keyword.": "一个陷阱的目的关键词描述了它在该地区的主要用途，包括其放置的理由和陷阱的总体目标。有些陷阱可能会做以下多项工作，但其主要目的会反映在关键词中。",
	"These traps notify someone or something to the presence of intruders. The alert need not only {@homebrew be} in the form of a sound.": "这些陷阱通知某人或某物有入侵者存在。警报不仅需要{@homebrew be}以声音的形式出现。",
	"These traps impede creatures from proceeding in a particular direction. The trap could stand in the way of multiple avenues, not only one. It could also prevent retreat.": "这些陷阱阻碍了生物向某个特定方向前进。陷阱可以挡住多条途径，而不是只有一条。它也可以阻止撤退。",
	"Traps intended to cause damage or possibly kill creatures have this keyword.": "旨在造成伤害或可能杀死生物的陷阱有这个关键词。",
	"These kinds of traps disable or hamper creatures, damaging their senses or imposing conditions": "这类陷阱使生物丧失能力或受到阻碍，损害它们的感官或施加条件。",
	"A trap that captures creatures alive, either by containing them physically or with magic, has this keyword.": "一个能活捉生物的陷阱，不管是通过物理方式还是用魔法，都有这个关键词。",
	"A trap is easily thought of as an \"if/then\" statement: \"If this happens, then that happens.\" This means that the most basic components of a trap are its trigger and its effect. Every trap has at least one of each.": "陷阱很容易被认为是一个 \"如果/那么 \"语句。\"如果这个发生，那么那个就会发生\"。这意味着一个陷阱最基本的组成部分是它的触发器和它的效果。每个陷阱都至少有一个。",
	"Triggers come in all shapes and sizes. They can be as basic as a tripwire strung across a path, but they can be more complex, such as a weight-sensitive floor which only activates when a certain amount of weight, or more, is placed on it. Triggers come in three varieties.": "触发器有各种形状和大小。它们可以是最基本的，如横跨一条道路的绊线，但也可以更复杂，如对重量敏感的地板，只有当一定的重量或更多的重量放在上面时才会激活。触发器有三种类型。",
	"The trigger has some sort of mechanical apparatus or it relies on things like gravity and momentum.": "触发器有某种机械装置，或者它依靠重力和动量等东西。",
	"The trigger could be created using mundane or magical means and functions respectively (i.e., a \"wrong key\" trap could detect a wrong key using internal pins and mechanisms, or simply with an arcane enchantment).": "触发器可以分别使用世俗或魔法手段和功能来创建（例如，一个 \"错误的钥匙 \"陷阱可以使用内部插销和机制来检测一个错误的钥匙，或者简单地使用一个奥术魔法）。",
	"The trigger functions purely by magical means.": "触发器的功能纯粹是通过魔法手段。",
	"No matter the type, all triggers share a common trait: if their requirements are met, they activate.": "不管是什么类型，所有的触发器都有一个共同的特点：如果满足它们的要求，它们就会激活。",
	"Effects come in the same three varieties that triggers do:": "效果与触发器一样，有三种类型。",
	"The effect functions via mechanical maens, or relies on things such as gravity or momentum. No part of the effect is magical (fire comes from a natural source, real rocks fall down, etc).": "这种效果通过机械原理发挥作用，或者依靠重力或动量等东西。效果的任何部分都不具有魔力（火来自于自然源，真正的石头会掉下来，等等）。",
	"The effect could be created using mundane or magical means and functions respectively (i.e., poison gas could start filling the room, but the gas could be created with either chemicals or magic).": "这种效果可以分别用世俗的或魔法的手段和功能来创造（例如，毒气可以开始充满房间，但毒气可以用化学品或魔法创造）。",
	"The effect is created purely with magic.": "这种效果纯粹是用魔法创造的。",
	"No matter the type, all effects common trait, if their trigger is activated, the effect occurs.": "不管是什么类型，所有效果的共同特征是，如果其触发器被激活，效果就会发生。",
	"No one likes being hit with something they had no chance to see coming. When it comes to traps, it is important to always know what the characters can do to detect elements of the trap.

	"Not all trap triggers can be detected in the same ways, and some can be more difficult to detect than others. A trigger housed within the doorjamb of a closed door is very difficult to find, but a pressure plate might be much easier to spot.": "并非所有的陷阱触发器都能以同样的方式被探测到，而且有些触发器比其他的更难探测。装在紧闭的门框内的触发器非常难发现，但压板可能更容易发现。",
	"The following are some concepts to consider when it comes to how characters detect traps in your game.": "当涉及到游戏中的人物如何探测陷阱时，以下是一些需要考虑的概念。",
	"There may be times when using a skill with an unorthodox ability may be appropriate, depending on the task. Consider the situation and your players' levels of creativity to determine whether doing something like this would be appropriate. Some tables also allow for something called the \"Rule of Cool\"; {@homebrew the|the the} GM will allow something that the system typically does not, simply because it makes the game more fun or adds to the situation in a way that makes for a better experience.": "有的时候，根据任务的不同，使用具有非正统能力的技能可能是合适的。考虑情况和你的玩家的创造力水平来决定这样做是否合适。有些表格还允许一些被称为 \"冷静法则 \"的东西；{@homebrew the|the the}GM会允许一些系统通常不允许的东西，仅仅是因为它使游戏更有趣，或以一种使人有更好体验的方式增加了情况。",
	"Have players describe what senses their characters are using to detect traps, instead of simply listing the skills they have on their character sheet. This can help engage the players and paint a more vivid picture of the scene in their mind's eye. Try to be aware of each creature's passive Perception": "让玩家描述他们的角色是用什么感官来探测陷阱的，而不是简单地在角色表上列出他们的技能。这可以帮助玩家参与其中，并在他们的脑海中描绘出更生动的场景。尽量注意每个生物的被动感知能力。",
	"Think about how much time is passing as the characters find and deal with traps. Even though it may only take a few minutes of real-world time, it may have been hours or even days in game time (or vice versa).": "想一想，当人物发现和处理陷阱时，有多少时间在流逝。尽管这可能只花了现实世界的几分钟时间，但在游戏时间里可能已经花了几个小时甚至几天（反之亦然）。",
	"Don't just let every player roll dice until someone detects and/or disarms the trap. Have the players describe, with some specifics, how they are attempting to detect or disarm the trap. This can slow things down just enough to add a bit of tension and get the players thinking, instead of just rolling until they win. Also consider that it rarely makes sense for every character to take turns attempting to disarm a trap. This is especially true if someone particularly suited to the task has already failed. Instead, characters can use things like the {@action Help} action, class features like {@class bard|phb|Bardic Inspiration}, or spells like {@spell guidance}. This will allow most everyone to participate, even if there is a specialist.": "不要只是让每个玩家掷骰子，直到有人发现和/或解除陷阱。让玩家描述他们是如何试图探测或解除陷阱的，要有一定的细节。这可以使事情变得缓慢，增加一点紧张感，让玩家思考，而不是一味地掷骰子，直到他们获胜。还要考虑到，每个角色轮流尝试解除陷阱是很难做到的。如果某个特别适合这项任务的人已经失败了，那就更是如此。相反，角色可以使用诸如{@action Help}行动、{@class bard|phb|Bardic Inspiration}的等级特征或{@spell guidance}的法术。这将使大多数人都能参与，即使有一个专家。",
	"If you're designing or including traps that relate to the overall story of your campaign, such as a ritual or important location within the dungeon, make sure to leave clues sprinkled throughout the rest of your adventure. If the players get their characters to this important spot and have no idea how to prevent a deadly trap, then it's not going to be very fun springing it on them unexpectedly. However, if they arrive armed with at least {@i some} information about the trap (how to detect it, or at least how to survive it) the experience will be far more memorable for all involved. You can also throw out subtle clues to trap triggers or effects, such as an odd smell, things out of place, or marks on the walls. How much information you put into your clue will impact what your players immediately decide to do.": "如果你设计的陷阱与你的活动的整体故事有关，比如一个仪式或地牢中的重要地点，请确保在冒险的其余部分留下线索。如果玩家把他们的角色带到这个重要的地方，却不知道如何防止一个致命的陷阱，那么在他们面前突然出现这个陷阱就不会有什么乐趣。但是，如果他们在到达时至少掌握了关于陷阱的信息（如何发现它，或者至少如何在它面前生存），那么对所有参与的人来说，这种经历将更加令人难忘。你也可以抛出关于陷阱触发或影响的微妙线索，如奇怪的气味、不合适的东西或墙上的标记。你在线索中放入多少信息会影响你的玩家立即决定做什么。",
	"In some cases a trap's trigger or effect may be extremely difficult to detect. It may be appropriate to use an Intelligence ({@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion}) check in order to reveal lore about the trap and its location within the surrounding area.": "在某些情况下，陷阱的触发或效果可能非常难以察觉。使用智力检查（（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%））可能是合适的，以便揭示关于陷阱的传说以及它在周围地区的位置。",
	"Once a trigger has been detected, it usually needs to be disarmed (unless it can simply be avoided, like a tripwire). Depending on the type of trap, disarming tends to work in different ways.": "一旦探测到触发器，通常需要解除它（除非可以简单地避开它，如绊网）。根据陷阱的类型，解除的方式也不同。",
	"Mundane triggers, or ambiguous triggers that are being used as mundane, are usually disarmed with a successful Dexterity check while using {@item thieves' tools|phb} or {@homebrew {@item trapmaker's tools|TreTra}|trapsmiths' tools}. The main objective when disarming a trap is to do so without accidentally setting it off.": "平凡的触发器，或者被当作平凡的触发器使用的模糊触发器，通常在使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}或{@homebrew {@item trapmaker's tools|TreTra}|捕兽工具的情况下，通过灵巧检查成功解除。｝ 解除陷阱的主要目的是为了不意外地引爆它。",
	"Magic triggers, or ambiguous triggers used as magic ones, are usually disarmed with {@spell dispel magic}. In the following chapters, if a trap can be disabled this way and the spell effect would be 4th level or higher, the DC for the {@spell dispel magic} ability check is noted. If there is no DC provided, the spell effect is 3rd level or lower.": "魔法触发器或用作魔法触发器的模棱两可的触发器，通常用（%0%）解除。在下面的章节中，如果一个陷阱可以通过这种方式解除，并且法术效果是4级或更高，那么就会注明（%1%）能力检查的DC。如果没有提供DC，则法术效果为3级或更低。",
	"Sometimes a magic trigger can be disarmed by erasing a rune on the wall or otherwise disrupting the magic of a trap. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check can disable a magic trap in this way, or reveal how it might be done. Optionally, another method could be allowing a spellcaster to make a spellcasting ability check to disarm a magic trap with intuitive knowledge of a small burst of magic.": "有时可以通过擦除墙上的符文或以其他方式破坏陷阱的魔法来解除魔法触发器。一个成功的智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}）检查可以通过这种方式解除魔法陷阱，或者揭示它可能的做法。可以选择的是，另一种方法是允许施法者进行施法能力检查，以对一小段魔法的直觉知识来解除魔法陷阱的束缚。",
	"Encourage players to be creative when dealing with traps. They may come up with a way of disabling or circumventing a trap that is not listed in the trap's entry. It's up to you to determine if this method could work, and what rolls or actions are required.": "鼓励玩家在处理陷阱时发挥创造性。他们可能会想出一种方法来解除或绕过陷阱，而这种方法并没有在陷阱的条目中列出。由你来决定这个方法是否可行，以及需要哪些掷骰子或行动。",
	"When players think outside the box to disarm or avoid a trap, consider rewarding them with something they can use later. This will help encourage players to bring their creativity to the table. Granting {@variantrule Inspiration|phb} or advantage on the character's next trap-related roll can be great motivation.": "当玩家跳出框框来解除或避开陷阱时，考虑用他们以后可以使用的东西来奖励他们。这将有助于鼓励玩家把他们的创造力带入到游戏中。给予（%0%）或在角色的下一次与陷阱有关的卷轴上的优势，可以是很大的激励。",
	"Some traps are rigged to activate on a failed attempt to disarm them, no matter the result of the ability check, while other traps are only triggered if the final result is particularly low. A critical failure (rolling a natural 1) when disarming a trap may result in additional hardships, at your discretion.": "有些陷阱被设计成在解除陷阱的尝试失败时启动，无论能力检查的结果如何，而其他的陷阱只有在最后的结果特别低时才会被触发。解除陷阱时的严重失败（滚动自然数为1）可能会导致额外的困难，由你决定。",
	"If a character has encoutnered a particular type of trap before, they may gain advantage when it comes to dealing with that kind of trap. If they have been successful in dealing with a particular trap (or type of rtap) in meaningful ways, they could slowly move toward gaining a bonus to disarming traps of that type. This is something that the player would need to keep track of on their character sheet, but it could be a raelistic way to mechanically represent expertise. Characters that have dealt with a kind of trap many times could get advantage or a bonus die (such as a {@dice d4} or {@dice d6}) to roll when making ability checks to detect or disarm that kind of trap.": "如果一个角色以前遇到过某种特定类型的陷阱，他们在处理这种陷阱时可能会获得优势。如果他们以有意义的方式成功地对付过某个特定的陷阱（或陷阱类型），他们可以慢慢地获得解除该类型陷阱的奖励。这是玩家需要在他们的角色表上记录的事情，但它可以成为一种机械地表现专业技能的合理方式。那些多次处理过某种陷阱的角色，在进行能力检查以探测或解除那种陷阱时，可以获得优势或一个额外的骰子（比如（%0%）或（%1%））来滚动。",
	"Sometimes a trap's effect stands out more than its trigger. In any case, detection still often uses the same skills as when detecting triggers, though a few more skills become relevant. Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) accoutns for the five senses and can be used actively or passively. Depending on the effect, other applicable skills are Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, and {@skill Religion}). And for magic effects, there is always {@spell detect magic}.": "有时一个陷阱的效果比它的触发器更突出。在任何情况下，探测仍然经常使用与探测触发器时相同的技能，尽管还有一些技能变得相关。智慧（{@skill Perception}）是五种感官的装备，可以主动或被动地使用。根据不同的效果，其他适用的技能是智力（（%1%）、（%2%）和（%3%））。而对于魔法效果，总是有（%4%）。",
	"Not all trap effects are hidden. Sometimes a nasty wall of spikes or a pendulum blade hanging from the ceiling in plain sight is enough to stop intruders in their tracks.": "并非所有的陷阱效果都是隐藏的。有时，一堵讨厌的尖刺墙或一把悬挂在天花板上的摆式刀片在众目睽睽之下就足以让入侵者停下脚步。",
	"Sometimes the only option to deal with a trap is to disable or negate its effects. Wedging climbing {@item piton|phb|pitons} between cracks of a trapdoor, packing dart holes with wooden dowels, or affixing a {@item bag of holding} to the water inlet of a flooding chamber are all ways to negate a trap's effects instead of disarming its trigger.": "有时，对付陷阱的唯一选择是使其失效或否定其效果。在陷阱门的缝隙中楔入攀爬的{@item piton|phb|pitons}，用木栓塞住镖孔，或者在水淹室的进水口贴上{@item bag of holding}，都是否定陷阱效果的方法，而不是解除它的触发。",
	"When designing or placing a trap, it is important to consider whether the trap would be able to reset itself or not.": "在设计或放置陷阱时，重要的是要考虑陷阱是否能够自我复位。",
	"{@b Mechanical traps} may or may not reset, depending on the elements of the trap itself. Very basic traps, such as a tripwire or a leaf-covered pit break or fall apart when activated. On the other hand, something like a swinging blade attached to a pressure plate may reset, depending on how well-engineered its internal mechanisms are.": "{@b Mechanical traps}可能重置也可能不重置，取决于陷阱本身的要素。非常基本的陷阱，如绊马索或覆盖着树叶的坑，在启动后会破裂或散开。另一方面，像连接在压力板上的摆动刀片可能会重置，这取决于其内部机制的设计是否完善。",
	"{@b Magic traps} may reset depending on the parameters of the trap. A {@spell glyph of warding} spell trap only casts a spell once, but a room enchanted to consistently affect a type of creature does so until dispelled or disarmed.": "{@b Magic traps}可能会根据陷阱的参数而重置。一个{@spell glyph of warding}的法术陷阱只施放一次法术，但一个被施法的房间会持续影响一种生物，直到被驱散或解除。",
	"{@b Hybrid traps} factor in mechanical and magic elements, so may or may not reset based on the design of their component elements.": "{@b Hybrid traps}的机械和魔法元素的因素，所以可能会或可能不会根据其组成元素的设计而重置。",
	"{@b Complex traps} usually reset automatically after a period of time, whether with magic or by mechanical means.": "{@b Complex traps}通常在一段时间后自动重置，无论是用魔法还是用机械手段。",
	"The pre-generated traps in the following chapters are designed to be as usable in multiple settings and situations, but there is no reason that you cannot make changes to them to suit your needs. Some of the traps may have slight bits of flavor, mentions of certain detection criteria, or other elements that are specific about one thing or another. These can be easily changed. For example, a trap could describe a room decorated with tapestries of dwarven war victories, with a magic trigger that activates whenever an elf walkes into the room. Instead, you can change this trap to be set in a forest clearing with trees carved to depict elven victories, with a magic trigger that activates whenever a dwarf enters the clearing.": "以下各章中预先生成的陷阱被设计为可在多种环境和情况下使用，但你没有理由不对它们进行修改以满足你的需要。有些陷阱可能会有一些轻微的味道，提到某些检测标准，或其他关于某种事物的特定元素。这些都可以很容易改变。例如，一个陷阱可以描述一个装饰着矮人战争胜利的挂毯的房间，有一个魔法触发器，只要有精灵走进这个房间就会激活。相反，你可以把这个陷阱改成设置在一个森林空地上，空地上的树木雕刻着精灵的胜利，只要有矮人进入空地，就有魔法触发。",
	"We were heading to a centuries-old abandoned temple deep in the jungle. The whole place has been swallowed up by vines, lichen, and saplings. The trail we chose was well used, but as we got deeper into the jungle, it got uncomfortably narrow. Scattered throughout the undergrowth were vestiges of strange shrines and crudely constructed altars made of stone, wood, and animal parts.": "我们要去的是丛林深处一座有几百年历史的废弃寺庙。整个地方已经被藤蔓、地衣和树苗吞没了。我们选择的这条小路很好走，但随着我们深入丛林，它变得令人不舒服的狭窄。在灌木丛中散落着一些奇怪的神龛遗迹，以及用石头、木头和动物零件制成的简陋的祭坛。",
	"It bears mentioning that, given the unnerving nature of all of this,—not to mention the admonishments from the locals that went something like \"don't visit the temple,\" and \"you could be taken captive by ancient sorceries,\" and \"you'll surely perish,\"—we were a bit on edge. Our ranger, keenly interested by the shrines and altars, inspected them but could not discern their purpose. That doesn't mean they didn't have one.": "值得一提的是，鉴于这一切都令人不安，更不用说当地人的告诫，如 \"不要参观寺庙\"、\"你可能被古老的巫术俘虏 \"和 \"你肯定会灭亡\"，我们有点紧张。我们的护林员对这些神龛和祭坛非常感兴趣，检查了它们，但无法看出它们的目的。这并不意味着它们没有目的。",
	"Of course, per usual, our big barbarian took the lead because should an axe, spear, or wave of arries fly at us, it's better to have someone up front who can take it. Myself and the ranger were behind him and the cleric and wizard were at back, discussing the artifact we were looking for, thoughts about the temple, and what challenges might lie inside.": "当然，按照惯例，我们的大野蛮人打头阵，因为如果有斧头、长矛或箭雨向我们飞来，最好有一个人在前面，他可以承受。我和游侠在他后面，牧师和巫师在后面，讨论我们要找的神器，对神庙的看法，以及里面可能存在的挑战。",
	"So there we were, walking down this dense, green, throat of a path through the jungle when I noticed something. A little play of light near the ground caught my eye, and there before my eyes was a tripwire. And sure enough, just as I realized what I was seeing, the big man's foot ran right into it...": "所以我们就在那里，沿着这条茂密的、绿色的、穿过丛林的咽喉小路走着，这时我注意到了一些东西。地面附近的一点光亮吸引了我的注意，在我眼前的是一条绊马索。果然，就在我意识到我看到了什么的时候，那个大个子的脚正好碰到了它......",

From the ceiling. As soon as I opened my mouth to say something, we all felt this deep rumbling come from around us. Yes, it was pretty clear that things were about to get bad, and quickly.": "我环顾四周，看到尘埃漂浮在空中，在穿过寺庙入口的阳光下闪闪发光。这几乎有点漂亮。然后我注意到更多的灰尘。坠落的灰尘。从天花板上。当我张嘴想说些什么时，我们都感觉到从我们周围传来的深深的隆隆声。是的，很明显，事情即将变得糟糕，而且很快。",
	"The left wall started inching toward us and I could sense tiny (or, in some cases, not-so-tiny) bouts of claustrophobia blossoming in all of us.

If we didn't do something fast, we were going to be pulped or skewered; a fate I would perhaps wish on my worst enemies but almost certainly not upon myself or my compansions.": "左边的墙开始向我们走来，我可以感觉到我们所有人都出现了小小的（或者，在某些情况下，不那么小的）幽闭恐惧症的症状。更糟糕的是，一英尺长的尖刺从我们右边墙上的雕塑口中喷出。如果我们不迅速采取行动，我们就会被打成肉酱或被串起来；我也许会希望我最坏的敌人遭受这种命运，但几乎肯定不会希望自己或我的同伴遭受这种命运。",
	"As the walls got close, our barbarian (god bless the brute) stretched out his arms and braced against them. Every vein in his face stood out as he strained, his feet wide, his shoulders and back bunching and flexing as the pressure built. A horrendous grinding sound came from a mechanism within the walls as it fought the big man's incredible strength. He started screaming as his bones began cracking, muscle tearing. Our cleric started healing him, mending his body even as it was breaking...": "随着墙壁越来越近，我们的野蛮人（上帝保佑这个野蛮人）伸出他的双臂，撑住了墙壁。当他用力时，他脸上的每根血管都很突出，他的脚很宽，随着压力的增加，他的肩膀和背部都在束缚和弯曲。墙内的一个装置发出了可怕的磨擦声，因为它与这个大个子的惊人力量相抗衡。他开始尖叫，因为他的骨头开始断裂，肌肉撕裂。我们的牧师开始治疗他，即使他的身体在断裂，也在修补......",

Cracks raced along the walls and up into the ceiling itself as the whole place started coming down.": "... 至少，这是我希望发生的。哦，有欢呼声和许多欢呼声，但当我们开始走的时候，一切都在一个巨大的摇晃中让步。我们看到巨大的花岗岩雕像不祥地摇晃着，尘土从高高的天花板上倾泻而下。裂缝沿着墙壁和天花板急速上升，整个地方开始倒塌。",
	"Dazzling beams of sunlight streamed through as huge chunks of the ceiling broke free and slammed down around us. We darted left and right, avoiding them as best we could. There was a low groaning sound from above, which made our wizzard say something I'll not repeat here. One of the towering statues was falling straight toward us. While most of us reflexively screamed and futilely tried to brace for what was coming, our wizard stood tall, stretching out an arm as if mocking the gigantic carving.": "令人眼花缭乱的阳光束流过，巨大的天花板脱离了束缚，在我们周围砰然倒下。我们左冲右突，尽可能地避开它们。上面传来低沉的呻吟声，这让我们的巫师说了一些话，我就不在这里重复了。其中一个高大的雕像正向我们直坠而来。当我们中的大多数人反射性地尖叫并徒劳地试图为即将到来的事情做准备时，我们的巫师站在高处，伸出一只手臂，似乎在嘲笑这个巨大的雕像。",
	"As she screamed in defiance, a shimmering orb of force bloomed around us just as the incalculable tons of stone slammed into it. The world was filled with nothing but dust, grit, and the sound of rattling stone. I opened my eyes and saw my companions doing the same. We weren't smears on the ground! We were alive! As the dust settled, we looked around at the wreckage, and those sunbeams sliced through the gloom as a final, divine reward for our work.": "当她发出反抗的尖叫时，一个闪闪发光的力量球体在我们周围绽放，就在那无法估量的数吨石头撞上它时。世界上除了灰尘、砂砾和石头的响声，什么都没有。我睁开眼睛，看到我的同伴们也在这样做。我们不是地面上的污点！我们还活着！\"我说。我们还活着。尘埃落定后，我们环顾四周的残骸，那些太阳光划过阴霾，作为对我们工作的最后、神圣的回报。",

	"When selecting and implementing traps, think about who is building these traps, how sophisticated they are, and why they were built in the first place. For example, a tropp of goblins in the forest are likely to have many nets, snares, and poison darts set up to capture or kill prey. On the other hand, a group of cultists trying to protect the relics in their deity's temple could have traps designed to blast intruders with elemental magic, fatally wound them with scything blades, or crush them to death with closing walls.": "在选择和实施陷阱时，要想一想是谁在建造这些陷阱，它们有多复杂，以及为什么首先要建造这些陷阱。例如，森林中的妖精们很可能有许多网、陷阱和毒镖来捕捉或杀死猎物。另一方面，一群试图保护他们神庙中的遗物的邪教徒可能会有一些陷阱，用来用元素魔法轰击入侵者，用镰刀致命地伤害他们，或者用封闭的墙壁把他们压死。",
	"The spcae a trap occupies matters in terms of how things physically fit together. If a dungeon is built into a hill, but the internal ceiling of the dungeon is just below ground level otuside, things that rise up into the ceiling would stick out of the ground above. Creatures walking along would certainly wonder about a large, random-seeming portcullis sticking up out of an otherwise picturesque grassy hillside.": "陷阱所占据的空间对事物的物理结合方式很重要。如果一个地牢建在山上，但地牢的内部天花板刚好低于地面，那么升到天花板上的东西就会从地面上伸出来。走在路上的生物肯定会对在一个风景如画的山坡上伸出一个巨大的、看起来很随意的门闩感到奇怪。",
	"Traps are obstacles for the characters to overcome. When planning a trap, consider whether or not you want the characters to find it. A trap that the characters are likely to find with ability checks or spells makes them expend resources overcoming the trap, as well as providing an interesting and exciting challenge.": "陷阱是人物要克服的障碍。在计划陷阱时，要考虑你是否想让角色找到它。角色有可能通过能力检查或法术找到的陷阱会使他们花费资源来克服这个陷阱，同时也提供了一个有趣和令人兴奋的挑战。",
	"A trpa that the characters shouldn't be able to find, usually because the DC to spot it is very high, can provide a nasty surprise. It could serve as a warning that the characters aren't prepared to enter a specific area, or it can be something they stumble into to further the plot of the story you are telling.": "角色不应该发现的蛛丝马迹，通常是因为发现它的DC非常高，可以提供一个令人讨厌的惊喜。它可以作为一个警告，说明人物还没有准备好进入一个特定的区域，也可以是他们偶然发现的东西，以促进你正在讲述的故事的情节。",
	"However, don't keep a trap hidden or make it extremely hard to find when it would certainly kill one or more of the characters or make it impossible for them to achieve their goal. The characters should have a fair chance to spot a trap that deadly and have a good shot at avoiding its effects. The point of such a trap is not, in fact, to kill anyone or to derail the adventure; it's to confront characters with a life-or-death, win-or-lose challenge that they must overcome. Realizing that everything is on the line has a wonderfully clarifying effect. To paraphrase Wiston Churchill, \"nothing in life is so exhilarating as being shot at and missed!\"": "然而，当陷阱肯定会杀死一个或多个人物或使他们无法实现目标时，就不要把它藏起来或使它极难发现。人物应该有一个公平的机会来发现一个致命的陷阱，并有一个很好的机会来避开它的影响。事实上，这种陷阱的意义并不在于杀死任何人或使冒险脱轨；而在于让人物面对一个生死攸关、不赢则输的挑战，他们必须克服。意识到一切都在劫难逃，有一种奇妙的澄清效果。套用威斯顿-丘吉尔的话说，\"生活中没有什么比被枪击和失手更令人振奋了！\"",
	"It is always your responsibility as the GM to be prepared for the worst-case scenario when players encounter any traps you use or create. With this thought process as a guide, you can design traps that are not only clever and devious, but that also further the plot and heighten excitement.": "当玩家遇到你使用或创造的任何陷阱时，作为GM，你始终有责任为最坏的情况做好准备。以这个思考过程为指导，你可以设计出不仅聪明、狡猾，而且能促进情节发展、提高兴奋度的陷阱。",

	"If a character tries to build a trap in the middle of a game, try to glean from the player what they're hoping the trap will accomplish. Then, consult {@book Chapter 9|TreTra|10} and use the {@table Trigger and Effect Generation table|TreTra|Random Trap Generator} to determine what trap trigger and effect would best suit their trap. If a player asks about this outside of the game, you may instead choose to explore this chapter with them and design a trap from the ground up together that best suits their character's needs.": "如果一个角色在游戏过程中试图建造一个陷阱，试着从玩家那里了解他们希望这个陷阱能达到什么目的。然后，咨询（%0%）并使用（%1%）来确定什么样的陷阱触发和效果最适合他们的陷阱。如果玩家在游戏之外问起这个问题，你可以选择和他们一起探讨这一章，一起从头设计一个最适合他们角色需要的陷阱。",
	"Other things to consider for character-created traps may include how long it takes to set up a trap of that type (digging a pit, rigging a hidden weapon, etc.) and what materials are needed to create the trap. It is up to your discretion as a GM to determine how realistic you wish the character's trap creation experience to be.": "其他需要考虑的问题包括：设置该类型的陷阱需要多长时间（挖坑、安装暗器等）以及制作陷阱需要哪些材料。作为GM，你可以自行决定你希望角色创造陷阱的经历有多真实。",
	"A simple trap usually has a single trigger and a single effect, either of which could be magic or mundane. Simple traps do not reset after they've been triggered.": "一个简单的陷阱通常只有一个触发器和一个效果，其中任何一个都可能是魔法或世俗的。简单陷阱在被触发后不会重置。",
	"A complex trap is any that goes beyond having a single trigger and single effect. It might be a gauntlet of obstacles, a trap that has multiple phases, or a trap that can be triggered by several different things. The intricacies of building complex traps are addressed in {@book Chapter 7|TreTra|8}.": "复杂的陷阱是指任何超越了单一触发和单一效果的陷阱。它可能是一个由障碍物组成的高塔，一个有多个阶段的陷阱，或者一个可以由几个不同的东西触发的陷阱。建造复杂陷阱的复杂性将在{@book Chapter 7|TreTra|8}中讨论。",
	"A simple trigger is typically binary, something that is just on or off, such as a switch or button. A multi-stage trigger, however, is one that goes in phases or that has multiple requirements.": "一个简单的触发器通常是二进制的，只是开或关的东西，如一个开关或按钮。然而，多阶段触发器是一个分阶段的或有多种要求的。",
	"One of the scariest real world traps is a carnivorous plant called the venus fly trap. It catches flies and other small insects when they land on its specially evolved leaves. These leaves have many sensitive hair-like protrusions, and the trap only closes when two different hairs are touched within 20 seconds. This helps the plant avoid false triggers.": "现实世界中最可怕的陷阱之一是一种叫做维纳斯捕蝇器的多肉植物。当苍蝇和其他小昆虫落在它特殊进化的叶片上时，它就会捕捉它们。这些叶子有许多敏感的毛发状突起，只有在20秒内接触到两根不同的毛发时，陷阱才会关闭。这有助于该植物避免错误的触发。",
	"A locked door with a swinging log hanging behind it, ready to smash any intruders, is a simple trap. But to keep inhabitants of the dungeon from being pulped, the engineer installed it with a multi-stage trigger. If the lock is disabled with {@item thieves' tools|phb}, and if the door is then opened, the trap activates. These measures prevent the trap going off when an unintended target unlocks the door with a key and opens it.": "一扇锁着的门，后面挂着一根摆动的木头，准备砸死任何入侵者，这是一个简单的陷阱。但为了防止地牢里的居民被拉死，工程师给它安装了一个多阶段的触发器。如果锁被禁用（%0%），如果门被打开，陷阱就会启动。这些措施可以防止陷阱在非故意的目标用钥匙解锁并打开门的时候响起。",
	"Pairing two or more trap effects can add complexity to the encounter, especially when one effect restrains or confines characters to one area. A trap that restrains creatures with a net makes it much harder for them to run away from a boulder rolling towards them.": "将两个或更多的陷阱效果搭配在一起可以增加遭遇战的复杂性，特别是当一个效果将角色限制在一个区域时。一个用网束缚生物的陷阱使他们更难从滚向他们的巨石中跑开。",
	"Traps should be exciting and memorable moments, not frustrating or boring. Avoid situations where characters have no countermeasures against a trap; make them engaging or interesting, not just a way to drain resources. Traps can provide information about the area, take characters to parts of a dungeon, or give clues about the owner or creator of a structure.": "陷阱应该是令人激动和难忘的时刻，而不是令人沮丧或无聊。避免出现角色对陷阱没有对策的情况；要让它们变得有吸引力或有趣，而不仅仅是消耗资源的一种方式。陷阱可以提供有关该地区的信息，把人物带到地牢的某些地方，或者提供有关某个建筑的主人或创造者的线索。",
	"Some traps may be detectable, but require characters to have prior knowledge of their existence or some specific piece of information to bypass them or disable them. A successful Intelligence ({@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion}) check, depending on the context, can all provide these kinds of clues. The DC for these checks is based on the trap's severity.": "有些陷阱是可以发现的，但需要角色事先知道它们的存在，或者一些特定的信息来绕过它们或使它们失效。根据具体情况，成功的智力检查（（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%））都可以提供这些线索。这些检查的DC是根据陷阱的严重程度而定的。",
	"For example, if the characters are in a dungeon of some evil antagonist where countless other heroes have lost their lives, there is likely to be some information about the dungeon written down in books. An Intelligence ({@skill History}) check may be appropriate to reveal clues about possible magical triggers they may find (if anyone got out, able to tell the tale). While exploring the crypt of a long dead and once powerful paladin, searching for an ancient relic, an Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check might reveal information about the tomb's defenses.": "例如，如果人物在某个邪恶的敌人的地牢中，无数的英雄在那里丧生，那么很可能有一些关于地牢的信息被写在书上。智力（（%0%））检查可能是合适的，可以揭示他们可能发现的有关魔法触发器的线索（如果有人逃出来，能够讲述这个故事）。在探索一个早已死去的、曾经强大的圣骑士的墓穴，寻找一个古老的遗物时，智力（（%1%））检查可能会发现关于墓穴防御的信息。",
	"Even if these checks don't give details about the traps themselves, they may give clues about those who might have set them, or important information that could be creatively applied to the situation.": "即使这些检查没有提供关于陷阱本身的细节，也可能提供关于可能设置陷阱的人的线索，或者可以创造性地应用于情况的重要信息。",
	"Traps can provide information even after they've been activated. Finding evidence of triggered traps—such as corpses, burns, rubble, or blood—can let characters know to be wary or that someone else is after the same thing they are.": "陷阱即使在被激活后也能提供信息。找到被触发的陷阱的证据--如尸体、烧伤、瓦砾或血迹--可以让角色知道要警惕，或知道别人在追寻他们的东西。",
	"The overall difficulty or threat your trap can pose to characters is a combination of two things: the level of the characters encountering it and the trap's lethality.": "你的陷阱能对角色构成的总体难度或威胁是由两件事组成的：遇到它的角色的水平和陷阱的致命性。",
	"A trap's level is expressed as one of five ranges: 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, and 17-20. An appropriate trap will be in the range that incldues the average level of your characters.": "陷阱的级别表示为五个范围之一。1-4，5-8，9-12，13-16，和17-20。一个合适的陷阱会在包括你的角色的平均水平的范围内。",
	"Variable statistics for a trap such as attack bonus, damage, ability check and saving throw {@homebrew DCs|DC's}, and spell level all depend on the trap's lethality. A trap intended to be a {@b setback} is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, but a {@b moderate} trap likely will. A {@b dangerous} trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels and a {@b perilous} trap almost definitely will. A {@b deadly} trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.": "陷阱的变量统计，如攻击奖励、伤害、能力检查和救赎（%0%），以及法术等级都取决于陷阱的致命性。一个旨在成为{@b setback}的陷阱不太可能严重伤害指定等级的角色，但一个{@b moderate}的陷阱可能会。一个{@b dangerous}的陷阱可能会严重伤害（并有可能杀死）指定等级的角色，而一个{@b perilous}的陷阱几乎肯定会。一个{@b deadly}的陷阱可能会杀死指定等级的人物。",
	"Always consider the message that traps of various lethalities and their placement can convey to the players. For example, placing a setback trap near the entrance of the dungeon may help to warn the players that there are probably more trpas inside. This should tip them off to beware. Placing a dangerous trap at the entrance, however, could tip them off that they might need more supplies, such as {@item potion of healing|dmg|potions of healing}, or let them know that they aren't of an appropriate level for this area. These are just a few ways that traps can be used to set expectations and tone.": "始终考虑各种致命性的陷阱和它们的位置可以向玩家传达的信息。例如，在地牢的入口处放置一个后退的陷阱可能有助于警告玩家，里面可能有更多的陷阱。这应该提示他们要小心。然而，在入口处放置一个危险的陷阱，可以提示他们可能需要更多的物资，比如（%0%），或者让他们知道他们的等级不适合这个区域。这些只是陷阱用来设定期望和基调的几种方式。",
	"Traps attack creatures in one of two ways. If a creature's armor is the main or only thing that could defend against the attack, or if the trap is attacking with a small number of separate weapons, the trap rolls an attack roll against the creature's AC. If a trap would make 6 or more attacks in a single turn, creatures should roll a Dexterity saving throw to avoid damage. A creature takes no damage if they succeed and half the damage if they fail.": "陷阱以两种方式中的一种攻击生物。如果一个生物的盔甲是主要的或唯一的可以抵御攻击的东西，或者如果陷阱是用少量的独立武器攻击的，那么陷阱就会对生物的AC进行攻击卷。如果一个陷阱在一个回合内会进行6次或更多的攻击，生物应该掷出一个灵巧的救赎来避免伤害。如果成功，生物不会受到伤害，如果失败，则会受到一半的伤害。",
	"Not all trpas deal damage, but those that do should be designed as an appropriate challenge. Traps deal damage based on their severity, either to a single target with attack rolls or to multiple targets if they make a group of creatures roll a saving throw. The trap can deal its damage all at once or over several rounds, but the maximum damage it deals shouldn't be more than the value indicated for its severity.": "并非所有的陷阱都会造成伤害，但那些会造成伤害的陷阱应该被设计成一个适当的挑战。陷阱根据其严重程度造成伤害，可以是对单个目标的攻击卷，也可以是对多个目标的攻击卷，如果它们使一群生物掷出一个蓄力球。陷阱可以一次性造成伤害，也可以在几个回合内造成伤害，但它造成的最大伤害不应超过其严重程度所显示的数值。",

You can use these tables to generate a trap on the fly, but they function best when you have time to consider all the possibilities and ramifications. Create a few traps in advance so that you have some options for just the right situation.": "在这一章中，你会发现一组关于陷阱的两个关键部分的表格：一个触发器和一个效果。这个表格并没有为你做所有的工作，但它确实产生了一个概念。然后，你可以通过决定触发器和效果的具体细节，它们如何共同发挥作用，以及它们如何融入它们所在的空间，来充实这个概念。你可以使用这些表格来即时生成一个陷阱，但当你有时间考虑所有的可能性和后果时，它们的功能是最好的。提前创建一些陷阱，这样你就有一些选择来应对正确的情况。",
	"The table contains 50 unique triggers and 50 unique effects. You can roll a {@dice d100} two times, using the first result to determine your trigger, and the second to determine your effect. You can also choose a combination of trigger and effect from the table, or you can choose one half of the trap and roll randomly for the other.": "该表包含50个独特的触发器和50个独特的效果。你可以掷出{@dice d100}两次，用第一次的结果来决定你的触发器，第二次的结果来决定你的效果。你也可以从表中选择一个触发器和效果的组合，或者你可以选择陷阱的一半，随机掷出另一半。",
	"Generating traps is not without its idiosyncrasies. Every combination of trigger and effect presented in this section can work together, but some may require a little extra thought.": "陷阱的产生并非没有特异之处。本节介绍的每个触发器和效果的组合都可以一起使用，但有些可能需要额外考虑。",
	"For example, consider a trap with a mundane trigger and a magic effect, such as a pressure plate that teleports the target to another location. The pressure plate could be in a narrow hallway, with a portal disguised as a mirror. When the target approaches to look into the mirror they step on the pressure plate, which catapults them into the portal.": "例如，考虑一个具有世俗触发器和魔法效果的陷阱，比如一个可以将目标传送到另一个地方的压力板。压板可以放在一个狭窄的走廊里，有一个伪装成镜子的入口。当目标走近看镜子时，他们会踩到压板，从而将他们弹入传送门。",
	"What about a magic trigger paired with a mundane effect? The target draws their weapon in the trap's range, making it cast {@spell produce flame} on a candle hidden in the ceiling. Just above the candle is a thin rope, from which hangs a jug filled with oil. Once the flame burns through the rope the jug falls to the ground, shattering and releasing the oil. The still burning rope tied to the jug ignites the oil and all creatures within a 20 foot radius are set ablaze.": "一个魔法触发器搭配一个世俗的效果如何？目标在陷阱的范围内拔出他们的武器，使其对隐藏在天花板上的蜡烛施放（%0%）。蜡烛上方有一根细绳，上面挂着一个装满油的壶。一旦火焰烧穿了绳子，壶就会掉到地上，碎裂并释放出油。绑在壶上的仍在燃烧的绳子点燃了油，方圆20英尺内的所有生物都被点燃了。",
	"The best way to be safe from any trap is to notice its trigger and avoid it, which isn't always easy or even possible. No trap should be both impossible to find and impossible to avoid or mitigate. It may, however, be one or the other. If it's easy to find, then it's fair to severely punish creatures who don't find it by making the saving throw difficult or not allowing one at all. If a trap is impossible to find or to bypass, then there should be a way to mitigate or negate the damage entirely.": "躲避任何陷阱的最好方法是注意到它的触发点并避开它，这并不总是容易的，甚至是可能的。任何陷阱都不应该是既不可能找到又不可能避免或减轻的。然而，它可能是其中之一。如果它很容易找到，那么严厉惩罚那些没有找到它的生物是公平的，因为它使救赎投掷变得困难或者根本不允许投掷。如果一个陷阱是不可能找到或绕过的，那么就应该有一种方法来减轻或完全否定伤害。",
	"Always think about triggers in specific, real-world terms, not just dice rolls. You want to be able to describe in detail what characters see or feel as they explore. Consider all the senses. Sight and sound are common descriptors, but smell, taste, and texture can help set the scene as well.": "始终用具体的、现实世界的术语来考虑触发因素，而不仅仅是骰子的滚动。你要能够详细地描述人物在探索过程中看到的或感觉到的东西。考虑到所有的感官。视觉和听觉是常见的描述词，但嗅觉、味觉和质感也可以帮助设定场景。",
	"Trap triggers come in three different forms: mundane, ambiguous, and magic. Each kind of trigger says something about the purpose of the trap and how best to use it.": "陷阱的触发器有三种不同的形式：世俗的、模糊的和魔法的。每种触发器都说明了陷阱的目的以及如何最好地使用它。",
	"Mundane triggers are triggers without a magic component. They usually have some sort of mechanical apparatus—like clockwork, gears, or water pressure—but they can also be as simple as a floor tile that breaks when enough weight is applied.": "世俗的触发器是没有魔法成分的触发器。它们通常有某种机械装置，如发条、齿轮或水压，但它们也可以简单到像一块地砖，当施加足够的重量时就会破裂。",
	"Ambiguous triggers could be mundane, magic, or a combination of both. {@trap The Wrong Key|TreTra}, for example, might be a key of the wrong shape or size or it might be the right shape of key that hasn't been enchanted properly. One option is mundane while the other is magic.": "模糊的触发器可能是世俗的、魔法的，或两者的结合。例如，{@trap The Wrong Key|TreTra}，可能是一把形状或大小不对的钥匙，也可能是正确形状的钥匙，但没有被正确地施以魔法。一个选项是世俗的，另一个是魔法的。",
	"Magic triggers have far fewer limitations. They can be simple or complex, but they often include a hint of mysticism. A glyph that activates when a creature gets close enough is a classic example. There could be a magic trip wire that activates the trap or an {@spell alarm} spell that detects intruders and then activates the trap.": "魔法触发器的限制要少得多。它们可以是简单的，也可以是复杂的，但它们往往包括一丝神秘主义的色彩。一个当生物足够接近时就会激活的石刻就是一个典型的例子。可以有一个魔法绊脚石来激活陷阱，或者有一个{@spell alarm}咒语来探测入侵者，然后激活陷阱。",
	"Detecting a trigger of any kind usually requires a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Magic triggers can also be found with an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, but this doesn't let a creature sense the presence of magic. That's what {@skill detect magic} is for. An Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check represents a creature recognizing some arcane symbols or recalling a piece of lore about an object or area. Once discovered, an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check can be used to conduct a thorough examination of the trap trigger and deduce how to best to disable it.": "探测任何种类的触发器通常需要进行智慧（（%0%））检查。魔法触发器也可以通过智力（（%1%））检查来发现，但这并不能让生物感知到魔法的存在。这就是{@skill detect magic}的作用。智力（（%3%））检查代表一个生物认识到一些神秘的符号，或者回忆起关于一个物体或区域的传说。一旦发现，可以用智力（%4%）检查来对陷阱的触发器进行彻底检查，并推断出如何最好地解除它。",
	"There may be times when it may seem more appropriate to use a non-standard check, such as Dexterity ({@skill Perception}) if something requires a particularly deft touch.": "有些时候，使用非标准的检查似乎更合适，比如说，如果某件事情需要特别灵巧的触摸，那么使用灵巧（（%0%））。",
	"Always be aware of a creature's passive Perception (10 + the creature's Wisdom/Intelligence modifier + any bonuses, such as proficiency) and compare it to the relevant DCs for any trap they're approaching. If a creature's passive Perception equals or exceeds the DC to detect the trigger, the creature automatically detects it and can try to disable it.": "始终注意生物的被动感知能力（10+生物的智慧/智力修饰+任何奖励，例如熟练程度），并将其与他们正在接近的任何陷阱的相关DC进行比较。如果一个生物的被动感知力等于或超过检测触发器的DC，该生物就会自动检测到它，并可以尝试使它失效。",
	"Triggers with the {@b difficult} trait require an active Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to understand how they work and how they can be disabled.": "具有{@b difficult}特质的触发器需要主动进行智力({@skill Investigation})检查，以了解它们的工作原理和如何禁用它们。",
	"A trigger with this trait is more complex than usual. Once a creature detects the trigger, they must make a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to understand how it works. If the check fails, the creature cannot disable the trigger because they do not understand what they have found. A creature can attempt to understand a difficult trap again after completing a long rest.": "具有这种特性的触发器比通常的要复杂。一旦生物探测到这个触发器，他们必须成功地进行智力（（%0%））检查以了解它的工作原理。如果检定失败，该生物就不能禁用这个触发器，因为他们不了解他们所发现的东西。在完成长时间的休息后，生物可以再次尝试理解一个困难的陷阱。",
	"Identifying a trigger is one thing, but disabling it is another. Mundane triggers usually require a successful Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb}, while disabling magic triggers usually requires a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or a successful use of {@spell dispel magic}. Ambiguous triggers can require either option.": "识别一个触发器是一回事，但禁用它是另一回事。世俗的触发器通常需要使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}成功的灵巧检查，而禁用魔法触发器通常需要成功的智力({@skill Arcana})检查或成功使用{@spell dispel magic}。模糊的触发器可能需要两种选择。",
	"Most of the time, there's no drawback to failing to disable a trap, but if the trigger has the {@b sensitive} trait it could be disastrous if the check is particularly low.": "大多数时候，无法解除陷阱并没有什么坏处，但如果触发器有{@b sensitive}的特性，如果检查的结果特别低，就可能是灾难性的。",
	"Failing to disable a sensitive trigger may result in accidentally setting off the trap. Traps of {@b setback} and {@b moderate} lethality are triggered on failed disable checks totaling 5 or less. {@b Dangerous}, {@b perilous}, and {@b deadly} traps are triggered on failed disable checks totalling 10 or less.": "如果不能解除敏感的触发器，可能会导致意外地触发陷阱。致命性为{@b setback}和{@b moderate}的陷阱会在禁用检查失败的情况下被触发，总数不超过5。{@b Dangerous}, {@b perilous}, 和{@b deadly}的陷阱会在失败的检查中被触发，总数为10或更少。",
	"Sometimes triggers can be bypassed instead of disabled. Using {@spell silence} to get past a trap triggered by sound bypasses the trap, but it hasn't been disabled. If creatures make a sound near that trigger later on, without the protection of the spell, the trap can still activate.": "有时触发器可以被绕过而不是被禁用。使用{@spell silence}来越过一个由声音触发的陷阱，可以绕过该陷阱，但它并没有被禁用。如果以后生物在该触发器附近发出声音，没有法术的保护，该陷阱仍然可以激活。",
	"Refer to the table below when determining the DC for detecting and disabling triggers based on the lethality of the trap.": "在根据陷阱的致命性确定检测和禁用触发器的直流电时，请参考下表。",
	"Setback": "后退",
	"Moderate": "中等水平",
	"Dangerous": "危险的",
	"Perilous": "岌岌可危",
	"Deadly": "致命的",
	"Detailed descriptions of each type of trigger are presented below, along with suggestions regarding how the trigger might best be used. Common countermeasures are also provided. By no means are these the only possible options, just the most common.": "下文对每种类型的触发器进行了详细描述，并就如何最好地使用该触发器提出了建议。还提供了常见的应对措施。这些绝不是唯一可能的选择，只是最常见的。",
	"To make any of these triggers more challenging, you can add the difficult or sensitive trait.": "为了使这些触发器中的任何一个更具挑战性，你可以添加困难或敏感的特征。",
	"These triggers are primarily mechanical and don't have any magical component. Gears, levers, weights, springs, or other mechanical devices might be involved in the design of the trigger.": "这些触发器主要是机械的，没有任何神奇的成分。齿轮、杠杆、砝码、弹簧或其他机械装置可能参与了触发器的设计。",
	"A successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals a mundane trigger and a successful Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb} disables it. Mundane triggers that operate differently have their countermeasures noted in their descriptions.": "成功的智慧({@skill Perception})检查可以发现一个世俗的触发器，成功的灵巧检查使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}使其失效。运作方式不同的世俗触发器会在其描述中注明其对策。",
	"These triggers can be magical or not, depending on the situation. A book with a needle hidden in the spine that is on a spring-loaded release is a mundane combination of the {@trap Open/Close Object|TreTra|Open/Close} trigger and a {@trap Needle|TreTra} effect.": "这些触发器可以是神奇的，也可以不是，视情况而定。一本在书脊中藏有针的书，在弹簧的释放下，是{@trap Open/Close Object|TreTra|Open/Close}触发器和{@trap Needle|TreTra}效果的世俗组合。",
	"However, if the book was enchanted to trigger when opened, that would be a magical version of the {@trap Open/Close Object|TreTra|Open/Close} trigger.": "然而，如果这本书被施了魔法，在打开时就会触发，那就是魔法版的（%0%）触发。",
	"Unless noted otherwise, {@homebrew if|If} a trigger is mundane, a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals it, and a successful Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb} disables it.": "除非另有说明，{@homebrew if|If}触发器是世俗的，成功的智慧({@skill Perception})检查会显示它，成功的灵巧检查使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}使它失效。",
	"If a trigger is magic, a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, or {@spell detect magic} reveals it. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Intelligence}) check or {@spell dispel magic} disables the trigger.": "如果触发器是魔法，成功的智慧（（%0%））检查、智力（（%1%））检查或（%2%）会显示它。成功的智力（（%3%））检查或（%4%）使触发器失效。",
	"A magic version of an ambiguous trigger is usually the equivalent of a 3rd{@homebrew -}level abjuration spell for interactions with {@spell detect magic} and {@spell dispel magic}.": "一个模糊的触发器的魔法版本通常相当于一个3级{@homebrew -}的堕落法术，用于与{@spell detect magic}和{@spell dispel magic}的相互作用。",
	"Something that couldn't be achieved by a mechanical process, such as determining when a creature of a specific race enters a room, is probably a magic trigger. Magic triggers are often glyphs or runes of some kind, scribed onto the surface of a wall or object near the trapped area. They can also be crystals, orbs, plants, suits of armor, or something easy to hide in the area. When creating a trap with a magic trigger, it's usually better to have some object or glyph as the trigger since that gives a fixed point for determining range and other parameters of the effect.": "一些无法通过机械过程实现的东西，比如确定一个特定种族的生物何时进入一个房间，可能是一个魔法触发器。魔法触发器通常是某种石刻或符文，被刻在被困区域附近的墙壁或物体表面。它们也可以是水晶、球体、植物、盔甲或一些容易隐藏在该区域的东西。当创建一个带有魔法触发器的陷阱时，通常最好用一些物体或石刻作为触发器，因为这为确定效果的范围和其他参数提供了一个固定点。",
	"Unless otherwise noted, a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or casting detect magic reveals a magic trigger. Magic triggers can also be found with an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, but this represents a creature recognizing an object or area from their knowledge of magic; it's not a replacement for {@spell detect magic}. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or a successful {@spell dispel magic} cast on the trigger disables it.": "除非另有说明，成功的智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查或施放探测魔法会发现一个魔法触发器。魔法触发器也可以通过智力（（%1%））检查来发现，但这代表生物通过他们的魔法知识来识别一个物体或区域；它不能代替（%2%）。成功的智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查或成功的{@spell dispel magic}对触发器的施放会使其失效。",
	"Finding magic traps with {@spell detect magic} is usually pretty straightforward, but the spell doesn't reveal the nature of the trigger or what countermeasures might be necessary. {@spell Detect magic} can also be blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. In most cases, triggers are abjuration effects.": "用{@spell detect magic}寻找魔法陷阱通常是很直接的，但该咒语并没有揭示触发的性质或可能需要的对策。{@spell Detect magic}也可以被1英尺的石头、1英寸的普通金属、薄薄的铅板或3英尺的木材或泥土阻挡。在大多数情况下，触发器是弃权效应。",
	"Magic traps of 3rd level or lower are automatically disabled by {@spell detect magic}. For magic triggers of 4th level or higher, the DC required is 10 + the spell's level (or the trigger's spell level equivalent).": "3级或以下的魔法陷阱会自动失效（%0%）。对于4级或更高等级的魔法触发器，所需的DC是10+法术等级（或触发器的法术等级相当于）。",
	"The table below shows recommended spell levels for magic traps based on character level and trap lethality. You can use this table to determine the spell level of the trigger for {@spell detect magic} and it's DC for {@spell dispel magic}.": "下表显示了基于角色等级和陷阱杀伤力的魔法陷阱的推荐法术等级。你可以用这个表格来确定触发器的法术等级（%0%）和它的DC（%1%）。",
	"These are the parts of the trap that eviscerate, immolate, maim, poison, puncture and otherwise really mess up creatures. That is, unless they find ways to avoid them.": "这些都是陷阱的一部分，它们会使生物的内脏遭到破坏，使人致残，使人中毒，使人被刺穿，并以其他方式使生物陷入困境。也就是说，除非它们能找到避开它们的方法。",
	"Effects can be used in many clever ways. Consider placing an effect so that it targets someone other than the creature who triggered the trap. Whether it's a pit that opens 15 feet behind a pressure plate or a flame jet that engulfs every portion of a room except the 5-foot space containing a chest, shifting the effect away from the trigger provides a nasty surprise and makes some countermeasures less effective or even more dangerous.": "效果可以用很多巧妙的方法来使用。考虑放置一个效果，使其针对触发陷阱的生物以外的人。无论是在压力板后面15英尺处打开一个坑，还是在一个房间里除了装有箱子的5英尺空间之外的所有地方喷射火焰，将效果从触发者身上移开都会带来令人讨厌的惊喜，并使一些对策变得不那么有效甚至更加危险。",
	"Effects can be magic or mundane, depending on what works best for the trap and the nature of the effect. A {@trap Ring of Flame|TreTra} effect may be a flammable liquid, or it could be a {@spell wall of fire|phb|wall of {@homebrew fire|flame}} spell. A set of spears thrusting out from the passage wall could be as simple as it sounds, or they could be an illusion that deals psychic damage. Always think about the setting and what fits your campaign.": "效果可以是魔法的，也可以是世俗的，这取决于什么对陷阱最有效以及效果的性质。一个{@trap Ring of Flame|TreTra}效果可能是一种易燃液体，也可能是一个{@spell wall of fire|phb|wall of {@homebrew fire|flame}}法术。一组从通道墙上刺出的长矛可能和它听起来一样简单，也可能是一个造成精神伤害的幻象。总是要考虑到环境和适合你的活动的东西。",
	"For trap effects that deal damage, use the tables below to determine the outcome based on character level and trap severity. This damage may be dealt in one round, or it may be dealt over multiple rounds.": "对于造成伤害的陷阱效果，使用下面的表格来确定基于角色等级和陷阱严重程度的结果。这种伤害可能在一个回合内造成，也可能在多个回合内造成。",
	"Not all traps use a {@damage d10} damage die; that's just a baseline average for how much damage the effect should deal. For example, if several darts shoot at a level 10 character, and the trap is dangerous, the attack should deal around 49 damage on average. This means if each dart is dealing {@damage 1d4} damage, there will be around 20 darts involved in this one trap.": "不是所有的陷阱都使用{@damage d10}的伤害模子，那只是效果应该造成多少伤害的平均基线。例如，如果几个飞镖射向一个10级的角色，并且陷阱是危险的，攻击应该平均造成49左右的伤害。这意味着如果每个飞镖都造成{@damage 1d4}的伤害，那么这一个陷阱中会有大约20个飞镖参与。",
	"Use these values if the trap is making attack rolls against creatures or for any ability checks or saving throws the trap requires.": "如果陷阱在对生物进行攻击时，或者在陷阱需要的任何能力检查或蓄力时，使用这些数值。",
	"Detailed descriptions of each type of effect (mundane, ambiguous, and magic) are provided below. Each effect is presented with a description of how it is intended to function and some suggestions for how the effect might best be used. The effect's mechanics are listed, explaining how the trap affects creatures.": "每种类型的效果（世俗的、模糊的和魔法的）的详细描述都在下面提供。每个效果都有一个关于它如何发挥作用的描述，以及一些关于如何最好地使用该效果的建议。效果的机制被列出，解释了陷阱是如何影响生物的。",
	"Many of these effects refer to creatures within the trap's area or within range of the trap. A trap's specific range or area of effect is up to you, but should be mostly determined by its location and severity. A trap in a 20-foot square room that is only a setback might just target 1 creature or 1 5-foot square; if the trap is perilous it might affect the entire room.": "这些效果中有许多是指陷阱区域内或陷阱范围内的生物。一个陷阱的具体范围或作用区域由你决定，但主要应该由它的位置和严重程度决定。在一个20英尺见方的房间里，如果只是一个后退的陷阱，可能只是针对一个生物或1个5英尺见方的地方；如果这个陷阱很危险，它可能会影响整个房间。",
	"Some ambiguous effects and most magic effects presented below could be a {@spell symbol} spell or a spell trap version of {@spell glyph of warding}, each of which have specific rules for how its effects resolve. These rules supercede the general rules for trap effects. A trap effect that could be a {@spell glyph of warding} or {@spell symbol} is designated with the {@b spell trap} trait.": "一些模棱两可的效果和下面介绍的大多数魔法效果可能是{@spell symbol}的法术或{@spell glyph of warding}的法术陷阱版本，每一种都有其效果如何解决的具体规则。这些规则优先于陷阱效应的一般规则。一个可能是（％2％）或（％3％）的陷阱效果被指定为（％4％）的特性。",
	"Spell traps have a more fixed severity than other effects, due to the level of the stored spell. A spell trap storing {@spell prismatic spray} is always going to be at least 7th level spell slot, making at minimum a perilous trap for 13th-16th level characters. To allow for more flexibility, we've provided two versions of effects with the spell trap trait; one that is a {@spell glyph of warding} (spell trap) and one that isn't. You can use whichever version best suits your needs.": "法术陷阱比其他效果有更固定的严重性，因为储存的法术等级。一个储存了（%0%）的法术陷阱总是至少是7级的法术槽，对于13-16级的角色来说至少是一个危险的陷阱。为了允许更多的灵活性，我们提供了两个带有法术陷阱特性的效果版本；一个是（%1%）（法术陷阱），一个不是。你可以使用最适合你需要的版本。",
	"Similar to their trigger counterparts, mundane effects are primarily mechanical or, at the very least, lacking any magical component. Any locomotion is due to machinery, gravity, or naturally generated exertion (such as a goblin riding a bicycle in order to power a rotating pinwheel of death).": "与它们的触发器相似，世俗的效果主要是机械的，或者至少是缺乏任何魔法成分。任何运动都是由于机械、重力或自然产生的劳力（比如一个妖精骑着自行车为一个旋转的死亡风车提供动力）。",
	"Ambiguous effects can vary widely and could either be magical or origin or some sort of natural phenomenon. A pit could be filled with magically sustained fire, or be situated on a geothermal vent. A water blast could be a magically conjured jet, or a geyser.": "暧昧的效果可以千差万别，可能是魔法或起源或某种自然现象。一个坑可能充满了神奇的持续的火，或者位于一个地热喷口上。水的爆炸可能是一个神奇的喷射器，或者是一个间歇泉。",
	"Traps with magic effects are clearly wondrous in some way. They either initiate spell effects when activated or they are spells such as {@spell glyph of warding} and {@spell symbol} that function as traps.": "具有魔法效果的陷阱显然在某种程度上是神奇的。它们要么在激活时启动法术效果，要么就是像{@spell glyph of warding}和{@spell symbol}这样的法术，作为陷阱发挥作用。",
	"Not all magic effects need to be explained by a spell that already exists already. Magic can do nearly anything, so you can come up with your own magic effects to best suit your needs. To prevent complications though, try and do this sparingly and make sure that the effect couldn't be duplicated with a spell. If you do create a custom effect, make sure to give it a spell level appropriate to it's severity and school of magic for interactions with spells like {@spell detect magic} and {@spell dispel magic}": "不是所有的魔法效果都需要用已经存在的咒语来解释。魔法几乎可以做任何事情，所以你可以想出你自己的魔法效果来最适合你的需要。不过为了防止复杂化，尽量少做这种事，并确保这种效果不能用咒语复制。如果你确实创造了一个自定义的效果，确保给它一个与它的严重程度和魔法流派相适应的法术等级，以便与{@spell detect magic}和{@spell dispel magic}等法术相互作用。",
	"Dungeons, ruins, crypts, and the like are all renowned for being places that folk in their right minds avoid. One major reason for this is that many of them are fraught with traps. These ingenious, sometimes brutish, devices, contraptions, and bits of magical malpractice are found all over, just waiting for some hapless adventurers to come put them to the test. There are plenty of times where having a monster or ruffian go to work on the characters is a perfectly serviceable course of action. At other times, good help is hard to find, and you want something dependable that can do the job without needing to be paid.": "地牢、废墟、地窖等都是著名的地方，人们在正常情况下都会避开。其中一个主要原因是，其中许多地方充满了陷阱。这些巧妙的，有时是粗暴的设备、装置，以及一些魔法失误，到处都能找到，只等着一些无助的冒险者来测试它们。有很多时候，让怪物或流氓去为角色工作是一个完全可行的行动方案。在其他时候，好的帮助很难找到，你需要一些可靠的东西，可以在不需要报酬的情况下完成工作。",
	"Traps can get stale very quickly and can easily be overused. A trap (especially a simple one) can often be spotted and disabled by one character, leaving the others waiting around. They can also hamstring certain characters who are not well-suited for traps.": "陷阱很快就会变味，很容易被过度使用。一个陷阱（尤其是一个简单的陷阱）往往可以被一个角色发现并禁用，而让其他人在旁边等待。陷阱也会束缚某些不适合使用陷阱的角色。",
	"Be judicious about which traps you choose and why. Make sure that you consider the capabilities of the characters and provide opportunities for them to shine, both as a group and as individuals. Try to have only one major trap, one combat encounter and one social situation between short rests. This gives most characters a chance to do something meaningful in an encounter between each short rest.": "对你选择的陷阱和原因要有判断力。确保你考虑到人物的能力，并为他们提供机会，让他们作为一个团体和个人发光发热。尽量在短暂的休息时间内只有一个主要的陷阱、一次战斗遭遇和一个社交场合。这使大多数角色有机会在每次短暂休息之间的遭遇中做一些有意义的事情。",
	"Overusing traps can make the game drag as players are overcome with paranoia, searching and checking every little thing. Traps are more effective and entertaining when they are a surprise.": "过度使用陷阱会使游戏变得拖沓，因为玩家被偏执狂征服，搜索和检查每一件小东西。陷阱如果是一个惊喜，就会更有效，更有娱乐性。",
	"Small spaces are usually less than a 20-by-25-foot room (500 square feet). The dimensions and shapes can vary, but what makes small spaces similar is that they are a room or enclosed space, not a corridor, passageway, or other primarily transitional space.": "小空间通常小于一个20乘25英尺的房间（500平方英尺）。尺寸和形状可以不同，但使小空间相似的是，它们是一个房间或封闭的空间，而不是走廊、通道或其他主要的过渡性空间。",
	"Small spaces are ideal for effects that are intended to impact the entire group since they ensure that targets are easier to hit. Gas clouds, collapsing floors, and magic glyphs are ideal for small rooms. As a general rule, think about traps that can take advantage of all potential targets being in close proximity.": "小空间对于那些旨在影响整个团体的效果来说是理想的，因为它们确保目标更容易被击中。气体云、坍塌的地板和魔法石刻是小房间的理想选择。一般来说，要考虑能利用所有潜在目标都很接近的陷阱。",
	"Large spaces are usually larger than a 20-by-25-foot room (500 square feet). The dimensions and shapes of these large areas can vary, but, like their smaller brethren, they are often destinations, not transitional areas like hallways.": "大空间通常比20乘25英尺的房间（500平方英尺）大。这些大空间的尺寸和形状可能有所不同，但是，像它们的小兄弟一样，它们通常是目的地，而不是像走廊那样的过渡区域。",
	"Large spaces are ideal for effects that can single-out or endanger members of a group. Obstacles that separate the characters from each other–such as runes of {@spell chain lightning}, falling objects, and summoned monsters–all work well in larger areas. As a general rule, think about things that might require more space to function well. This is especially important if you're considering combining a combat encounter with a trap.": "大面积的空间对于那些可以单挑或危及团体成员的效果来说是理想的。将角色彼此分开的障碍物--如{@spell chain lightning}的符文、坠落的物体和召唤的怪物--在较大的区域都能很好地发挥作用。一般来说，要考虑那些可能需要更多空间才能良好运作的东西。如果你考虑将战斗遭遇与陷阱结合起来，这一点就特别重要。",
	"Large spaces are usually where something important takes place. Consider placing a trap that leads to a big moment in the campaign. The ceiling of the dungeon collapses, an epic monster is summoned, or the characters are {@condition paralyzed} so that the main antagonist can deliver their final monologue.": "大空间通常是发生重要事情的地方。考虑放置一个陷阱，导致活动中的一个重要时刻。地牢的天花板倒塌了，一个史诗般的怪物被召唤出来了，或者人物被{@condition paralyzed}，这样主要的敌人就可以发表他们最后的独白。",
	"Some trap triggers cover areas, but often they are centered or focused on a specific point within a location. In large areas, the trap engineer can take advantage of room features that draw attention or beg inspection. This can be things such as an item on display, a piece of architecture, or even a sound emanating from an unclear source.": "有些陷阱触发器覆盖了一些区域，但往往是以某一地点为中心或集中于某一特定点。在大范围内，陷阱工程师可以利用房间的特点，吸引人们的注意或要求检查。这可以是一些东西，如陈列的物品、建筑的一部分，甚至是从不明确的来源发出的声音。",
	"The trap effects can also take advantage of the wide space. In a large area, setting up forty hidden crossbows with enough ammunition to blanket the area in bolts is extremely resource and labor intensive. Perhaps those resources are available, but if it's unlikely the engineer would be able to build something like that, it is wise to consider what other trap effects might be more reasonable for the space.": "陷阱的效果也可以利用广阔的空间。在一个大的区域内，设置四十个隐蔽的弩炮，并配备足够的弹药来覆盖整个区域的枪弹，是非常耗费资源和人力的。也许这些资源是可用的，但如果工程师不太可能建造这样的东西，那么考虑一下其他的陷阱效果对这个空间来说可能更合理，是明智的。",
	"Corridors and passageways are spaces meant to be transitional, leading from one area to another. They are often narrow and are ideal areas for traps due to their linearity. Traps such as hidden crossbows, scything blades, and falling ceilings all benefit from targets with limited mobility. The dungeon engineer is also able to much more easily predict what potential targets will do and where they will go in a passageway than in an open room.": "走廊和通道是用来过渡的空间，从一个区域通向另一个区域。它们通常很狭窄，由于其线性特点，是设置陷阱的理想区域。陷阱，如隐藏的弓箭、镰刀和坠落的天花板，都得益于行动不便的目标。地牢工程师也能够更容易地预测潜在的目标在通道中会做什么以及他们会去哪里，而不是在一个开放的房间中。",
	"Whether by a wall of fire or a 2-ton stone cube, blocking the corridor at one or both ends creates a confined space for the targets of a trap. This may even be used to separate characters from one another.": "无论是火墙还是2吨重的石块，将走廊的一端或两端堵住，为陷阱的目标创造一个封闭的空间。这甚至可以用来将人物彼此分开。",
	"Crossbows or darts are most effective when placed at the end of the corridor. The target doesn't have much space to dodge out of the way, and if the projectile doesn't hit the target in the front it might hit a target further back.": "弩箭或飞镖放在走廊的尽头时最有效。目标没有太多的空间来躲避，如果弹丸没有击中前面的目标，可能会击中更后面的目标。",
	"Puzzles are often confused with complex traps. However, a trap can be disarmed while a puzzle must be solved. Puzzles are often used as a filter of sorts, preventing those without the right knowledge or who are unworthy from getting access to an item or a place.": "谜题往往与复杂的陷阱相混淆。然而，陷阱可以被解除，而谜题则必须被解开。谜题经常被用作某种过滤器，防止没有正确知识的人或不值得的人进入某个物品或地方。",
	"Good puzzles challenge the creatures interacting with them in ways other than a trap or a monster. Puzzles can be simple or complex, they may have a single stage or multiple stages with escalating difficulty, and they may have mechanical or magic elements. All of these aspects depend on who made it and what the puzzle is intended to do.": "好的谜题是以陷阱或怪物以外的方式挑战与它们互动的生物。谜题可以是简单的，也可以是复杂的，它们可能有一个阶段，也可能有多个难度升级的阶段，它们可能有机械或魔法元素。所有这些方面都取决于谁做的，以及谜题的目的是什么。",
	"Puzzles are, by their nature, designed to challenge {@i players} rather than their characters. They are intended to engage the brains of the players and give them an opportunity to tackle an intellectual exercise. This often means ignoring mots of what's on the character sheet and just letting the humans around the table figure out the solution. Ability checks should be used to offer hints when the group is stumped or stalled, but don't use them to simply give away the answer.": "谜题就其性质而言，是为了挑战{@i players}而不是挑战他们的角色。它们的目的是为了调动玩家的大脑，给他们一个解决智力问题的机会。这通常意味着忽略角色表上的内容，而只是让桌子周围的人想出解决办法。能力检查应该被用来在小组陷入困境或停滞时提供提示，但不要用它们来简单地给出答案。",
	"Puzzles may or may not have an element that deals damage, but such an effect should be passive or used as a penalty rather than an integral part or purpose of the puzzle. A floor with safe places to stand marked by runes while all other places have a breakaway floor is a good example of this. If the creature attempting the puzzle makes a mistake, the penalty is a fall into the unknown.": "谜题可以有也可以没有造成伤害的元素，但是这样的效果应该是被动的，或者作为一种惩罚，而不是谜题的一个组成部分或目的。一个地板上有符文标记的安全位置，而其他地方都有一个断裂的地板就是一个很好的例子。如果尝试解谜的生物犯了一个错误，那么惩罚就是跌入未知的世界。",
	"It can be jarring when a puzzle you introduce, especially a complex one, is bypassed in an unexpected way.": "当你引入的一个谜题，尤其是一个复杂的谜题，以一种出乎意料的方式被绕过时，可能会很刺耳。",
	"When using puzzles in a freeform, tabletop game it is important to know that sooner or later, players {@i {@b will}} solve a puzzle in a way you did not intend. When this happens, do not railroad players into finding {@i your} solution. Reward your players' ingenuity and enjoy the experience of seeing how {@i your} players interact with your puzzle.": "当在自由形式的桌面游戏中使用谜题时，重要的是要知道，玩家{@i {@b will}}迟早会以你无意的方式解决谜题。当这种情况发生时，不要强迫玩家去寻找{@i your}解决方案。奖励你的玩家的聪明才智，并享受看到玩家如何与你的谜题互动的经验（%2%）。",
	"In situations like these, we have a hard-and-fast rule: a {@i working} solution is the {@i correct} solution.": "在这样的情况下，我们有一个硬性规定：{@i working}的解决方案就是{@i correct}的解决方案。",
	"Dungeons don't have to be designed around monsters or traps. Instead, they can be designed around puzzles. Such dungeons focus on problems that need to be solved using player cleverness rather than in-game character prowess.": "地下城不一定要围绕怪物或陷阱来设计。相反，它们可以围绕谜题来设计。这种地下城的重点是需要用玩家的聪明才智而不是游戏中的角色能力来解决的问题。",
	"Theme is of particular importance when it comes to puzzles, much more so than traps. Sometimes the mere fact that a trap can dish out a desired effect is enough to use it. Puzzles, on the other hand, say something about the dungeon's owner and reinforce the theme of a dungeon. For instance, if a dungeon is the home of a lich who utilizes the undead, it would make sense for puzzles in that dungeon to be themed around death, life, and things tangentially related to those topics. It is very important that the puzzles found in the dungeon fit with its theme.": "当涉及到谜题时，主题是特别重要的，比陷阱更重要。有时候，仅仅是一个陷阱能够产生预期效果的事实就足以让人使用它。另一方面，谜题可以说明地牢主人的一些情况，并强化地牢的主题。例如，如果一个地牢是一个利用亡灵的巫师的家，那么这个地牢中的谜题就应该以死亡、生命和与这些主题相关的东西为主题。在地牢中发现的谜题与它的主题相符是非常重要的。",
	"A puzzle presents a problem that needs solving, and the characters should be able to solve the problem. This means that they must have access to the items, tools, or information required to solve the puzzle. There might be clues available in or around the puzzle, or they could have found some something before reaching the puzzle.": "一个谜题提出了一个需要解决的问题，而人物应该能够解决这个问题。这意味着，他们必须能够获得解谜所需的物品、工具或信息。在谜题中或周围可能有线索，或者他们在到达谜题之前已经找到了一些东西。",
	"If the characters aren't ready for the puzzle, there needs to be a clear way for them to understand that they should come back later. They should also have some idea of what will indicate when they are ready. It need not be so obvious as \"you must be this tall to ride\" but there should be clear indications of what they don't have that they will need to solve the puzzle.": "如果人物还没有准备好做这个谜题，就需要有一个明确的方法让他们明白他们应该以后再来。他们也应该有一些想法，知道什么会表明他们已经准备好了。这不需要像 \"你必须有这么高才能骑马 \"这样明显，但应该有明确的迹象表明他们没有什么东西，而他们将需要解决这个谜题。",
	"In the case of puzzles characters may not be ready for, be sure to provide other paths they can take. These alternatives can lead them to places where they will find what they need to solve the puzzle. If there are no alternate paths, ensure that they can go back the way they came and track down what they need to accomplish the puzzle.": "在人物可能还没有准备好的情况下，一定要提供他们可以采取的其他路径。这些替代路径可以引导他们找到他们需要的东西来解决这个谜题。如果没有替代路径，确保他们可以原路返回，找到他们需要的东西来完成谜题。",
	"Regarding the physical location of the puzzle, think like the dungeon's owner and ask yourself why they would want a puzzle in a particular spot, instead of a trap or monsters. A puzzle is, in most circumstances, a way to make sure that those who deserve to can proceed, and those who don't are stuck. Avoid placing puzzles in arbitrary places. This will help to make whatever is beyond the puzzle much more rewarding.": "关于谜题的物理位置，请像地牢的主人一样思考，问问自己为什么他们要在一个特定的地方设置谜题，而不是设置陷阱或怪物。在大多数情况下，谜题是一种方法，以确保那些值得继续的人可以继续下去，而那些不值得的人则被卡住。避免将谜题放置在任意的地方。这将有助于使谜题之外的东西更有价值。",
	"Puzzles that work well for small spaces are those that involve small things. This might involve things like a board game whose pieces need to be moved, or a puzzle box. This should be something where everyone can generally gather around and participate.": "适合小空间的拼图是那些涉及小东西的拼图。这可能涉及到像一个需要移动棋子的棋盘游戏，或一个拼图盒。这应该是每个人都能聚集在一起并参与的东西。",
	"Puzzles that work well for large spaces are those that can utilize different creatures doing different things at the same time. These puzzles make use of space, or situations where multiple creatures need to achieve something that one of them alone couldn't, such as pulling a lever in two different locations.": "适合大空间的谜题是那些可以利用不同生物同时做不同事情的谜题。这些谜题利用了空间，或者在一些情况下，多个生物需要实现它们中的一个人无法实现的目标，比如在两个不同的地方拉动一个杠杆。",
	"Puzzles that work well for corridors and passagways often make use of distance. This may mean that the components are laid out along the length of the hall, or it may require creatures to travel certain amounts of distance.": "对于走廊和通道来说，效果很好的谜题往往利用了距离。这可能意味着组件是沿着大厅的长度布置的，或者它可能要求生物走过一定的距离。",

	"Adding depth, mystery, and intrigue to an adventure can be the difference between a good campaign and a great one. Storytelling usually benefits from keeping a bit of information being from the main characters and then revealing that information at the moment that gives the best dramatic effect. This could be something as important as a relationship between the main antagonist and the heroes (such as the villain being one of the hero's blood relatives) or something more mundane, like a secret escape tunnel out of the final chamber of the dungeon.": "在冒险中增加深度、神秘感和阴谋，可以成为一个好的活动和一个伟大活动之间的区别。讲故事通常得益于对主要人物保留一些信息，然后在能产生最佳戏剧效果的时候揭示这些信息。这可能是像主要敌人和英雄之间的关系那样重要的东西（比如反派是英雄的血亲之一），也可能是更平凡的东西，比如从地牢的最后一个房间逃出的秘密通道。",
	"Characters can learn these secrets by seeking out learned scholars or ancient creatures that might know obscure facts. They can also pour over books, scrolls, and runes on dungeon walls. Dreams, visions, flashbacks, and other magical occurrences can also yield useful information.": "角色可以通过寻找博学的学者或可能知道晦涩事实的古代生物来了解这些秘密。他们也可以翻阅书籍、卷轴和地牢墙上的符文。梦境、幻觉、倒叙和其他神奇的事件也可以产生有用的信息。",
	"Each of these methods requires a different approach. Wisdom and Charisma-based skills such as {@skill Insight}, {@skill Persuasion}, and {@skill Intimidation} are useful when dealing with other creatures. When searching for written secrets, Intelligence-based skills like {@skill History} and {@skill Religion} are appropriate.

	"Hidden information can be broken down into three categories: story secrets, quest secrets, and environment secrets.": "隐藏的信息可以分为三类：故事的秘密，任务的秘密，和环境的秘密。",
	"Story secrets include things having to do with the overarching campaign and the characters' roles within it. The noble who gives the characters their quest to rid the land of vampires is himself a vampire. Two characters find out that they are actually half-siblings and share a psychic connection. The entire planet has a giant dragon slumbering inside of it. These are all secrets that could change the characters or how they relate to the world of your campaign.": "故事的秘密包括与总体战役和人物在其中的角色有关的东西。为人物提供清除吸血鬼的任务的贵族本身就是一个吸血鬼。两个角色发现他们实际上是同父异母的兄弟姐妹，并且有一种精神上的联系。整个星球有一条巨龙在里面沉睡。这些都是可以改变人物或他们与你的活动世界的关系的秘密。",
	"The best way to give out these secrets is slowly, as clues to a larger puzzle. Each piece helps to form a clearer picture of the whole secret. Better still, but more challenging, is to leave a trail of clues that lead the characters to the wrong conclusion. Then, when the final clue is in place, the revelation comes as a shock.": "泄露这些秘密的最好方式是慢慢地，作为一个更大的谜题的线索。每一块都有助于对整个秘密形成更清晰的印象。更好，但更有挑战性的是，留下一连串的线索，把人物引向错误的结论。然后，当最后的线索到位时，这个启示会让人感到震惊。",
