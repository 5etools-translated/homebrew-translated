	"Arkadia is a setting for the fifth edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game, inspired by the history and myths of ancient Greece. It draws on the spirit of classical antiquity, blending elements of ancient civilizations such as Rome, Egypt, Persia, and of course Greece, with traditional fantasy elements to create something wholly unique.": "阿卡迪亚是世界上最伟大的角色扮演游戏第五版的一个设定，其灵感来自于古希腊的历史和神话。它借鉴了古典古代的精神，将罗马、埃及、波斯等古代文明的元素与传统的幻想元素相融合，创造出完全独特的东西。",
	"The world of Arkadia presented in this book is one of gods and titans, mythical monsters and epic heroes. Familiar staples of the fantasy genre such as elves, dwarves, and orcs have been reimagined through the lens of Greek mythology and given a new place in this ancient, bronze age world. They exist alongside wonders both new and ancient, reimaginings of the gods, heroes, and myths of a lost age.": "本书所呈现的阿卡迪亚世界是一个由神和泰坦、神话中的怪物和史诗般的英雄组成的世界。熟悉的幻想类型的主食，如精灵、矮人和兽人，通过希腊神话的视角被重新想象，并在这个古老的青铜时代的世界中被赋予新的地位。它们与新的和古老的奇迹并存，是对失落时代的诸神、英雄和神话的重新想象。",
	"This book is divided into two parts. Part 1 is a handbook for players. It contains character options such as races, class archetypes, feats, and all the information a player needs to create and customize a character for an adventure in Arkadia.

Arkadia blends historical elements with those of myth and traditional fantasy to create something new.": "阿卡迪亚的灵感来自古希腊和古典世界的历史和神话，但它不是一个历史背景。阿卡迪亚将历史元素与神话和传统幻想中的元素相融合，创造了新的东西。",
	"Arkadia is not rooted in a year or bound to a chronology of events. The world is painted in broad strokes that depict a sweeping age defined in relation to its mythic past.": "阿卡迪亚没有扎根于某一年，也没有被某一事件的年表所约束。这个世界以宽泛的笔触描绘了一个与神话般的过去有关的广阔的时代。",
	"Arkadia exists in an age of bronze. Many weapons, armor, and items are different than those you would find in traditional fantasy. Instead of finding rapiers and crossbows in Arkadia you will and take up the spear and sling.": "阿卡迪亚存在于一个青铜时代。许多武器、盔甲和物品都与你在传统幻想中找到的不同。在阿卡迪亚，你不会找到剑和弩，而是会拿起长矛和吊索。",
	"Though the spells you will be casting in Arkadia are familiar, the style of magic is mythical rather than medieval. To this end, we encourage you to instil your spells with mythic flavor; instead of the spell spirit guardians conjuring angelic figures, it could instead summon a host of spectral hoplites, the spirits of your ancestors or fallen comrades, their arms and armor still scarred and pitted from their final battle.": "虽然你在阿卡迪亚施展的法术是熟悉的，但魔法的风格是神话的，而不是中世纪的。为此，我们鼓励你为你的法术注入神话色彩；与其说法术精神守护者召唤出了天使般的人物，不如说它召唤出了一大批幽灵般的跳兵，你的祖先或死去的战友的灵魂，他们的手臂和盔甲在最后的战斗中仍然伤痕累累。",
	"Though the presence of the gods can be felt throughout Arkadia, they are distant in a world shaped by the reverberations of their myths. Though their presence and the echoes of their deeds can be felt throughout the world, they are no longer physical beings walking among mortals. It falls to mortal heroes to take up the torch and decide the future of Arkadia.": "虽然整个阿卡迪亚都能感受到诸神的存在，但他们在一个由他们的神话回响所塑造的世界中是遥远的。虽然他们的存在和他们的事迹的回声在整个世界都能感受到，但他们不再是行走在凡人中间的实体。接过火炬，决定阿卡迪亚的未来，就落在了凡人英雄的身上。",
	"Though certain races, places, and classes in Arkadia are connected to specific gods, all gods are worshiped in all places. An Illyrian sailor might pray to Thessa for fair winds and calm seas before embarking on a voyage, just as an Ithean youth might pray to Lyria for their affections to be returned.": "尽管阿卡迪亚的某些种族、地方和阶层与特定的神灵有关，但所有的神灵在所有地方都受到崇拜。一个伊利安水手可能会在航行前向塞萨祈祷风平浪静，就像一个伊泰安青年可能会向利雅祈祷他们的感情得到回报。",
	"All magic in Arkadia flows from the age of gods. As in Greek mythology, all supernatural or fantastical elements in Arkadia—monsters, magic items, and even your heroic powers—are believed to ultimately stem from the gods or the titans.": "阿卡迪亚的所有魔法都来自诸神时代。与希腊神话一样，阿卡迪亚的所有超自然或幻想元素--怪物、魔法物品，甚至你的英雄力量--都被认为最终来自于诸神或泰坦。",
	"If it exists in another source book, it might exist in Arkadia. Many races and classes from the basic game would be at home in Arkadia, while others might challenge the tone or themes of the setting. Ultimately it is up to your GameMaster to decide what is appropriate for the version of Arkadia that is played at your table.": "如果它存在于其他资料书中，它可能存在于阿卡迪亚。基本游戏中的许多种族和等级在阿卡迪亚都很合适，而其他种族和等级则可能对设定的基调或主题构成挑战。最终，将由你的游戏管理员来决定什么是适合在你的桌子上玩的阿卡迪亚版本。",
	"Arkadian barbarians fight for fame and glory, that they may be immortalized among the gods. They are the quintessential heroes of might and courage, their names echoing across the ages, unforgettable and inspiring. Such heroes are known for taking upon themselves great labors, proclaiming loudly and publicly in the name of the gods to achieve great deeds for the good of all Arkadia, whether it be the slaying of mighty beasts and titanspawn or the reclaiming of lost relics and weapons of power. Whole ages turn upon the actions of such heroes, the fate of whole cities and peoples resting on their broad shoulders.": "阿卡德野蛮人为名声和荣耀而战，他们可以在诸神中永垂不朽。他们是强大和勇敢的典型英雄，他们的名字响彻古今，令人难忘，令人振奋。这样的英雄以承担伟大的任务而闻名，他们以神的名义大声宣布，为了整个阿卡迪亚的利益而成就伟大的事业，无论是杀死强大的野兽和泰坦新星，还是夺回丢失的遗物和力量的武器。整个时代都依赖于这些英雄的行动，整个城市和民族的命运都寄托在他们宽阔的肩膀上。",
	"Barbarians of the Path of the Hero are found throughout Arkadia, wherever there are great dangers to thwart or wealth and fame to be earned. They are especially drawn to Kryta and the god Krytos, who most celebrates their warrior spirit; and to Illyria, where their great deeds are immortalized forever in marble and bronze, and the bards sing songs of their glories. Path of the Berserker barbarians are most common in Kryta, especially among the orcs, and are beloved of Krytos, acting as mighty line breakers in his armies. Barbarians are also common among the fierce Oreyan elves, often tied to the wild spirits of nature.": "英雄之路的野蛮人遍布整个阿卡迪亚，只要有巨大的危险需要挫败，或者有财富和名声需要获得，他们就会出现。他们尤其被克莱塔和克莱托斯神所吸引，克莱托斯神最推崇他们的战士精神；他们也被伊利里亚所吸引，在那里，他们的伟大事迹被永久地保存在大理石和青铜器中，吟游诗人唱着他们的荣耀。狂战士之路 野蛮人在克里塔最为常见，尤其是在兽人中，他们深受克里托斯的喜爱，在他的军队中充当强大的破阵者。野蛮人在凶猛的奥雷安精灵中也很常见，他们常常与自然界的野性精神联系在一起。",

The College of theMuse is Lyria's greatest temple, resting on a hill overlooking decadent Illyria and surrounded by Arkadia's most beautiful garden. There, the gifted are trained in the arts of enchantment, diplomacy, politics, seduction, and—most importantly—the many epic tales of the gods and heroes of old, used to inspire future generations to similar acts of heroism and glory. Many then choose to take to the roads of Arkadia and spread such tales, to keep the heroic spirit alive in dark times, and celebrate it in peaceful ones. Others seek to become heroes in their own right, or inspire others to do so, undertaking great deeds.": "阿卡迪亚的吟游诗人被认为是美丽女神莱雅的选民。缪斯学院是莱雅最伟大的寺庙，坐落在俯瞰颓废的伊利里亚的山上，周围是阿卡迪亚最美丽的花园。在那里，有天赋的人接受了魔法、外交、政治、诱惑等方面的培训，最重要的是，他们接受了许多关于古代诸神和英雄的史诗般的故事，用来激励后人进行类似的英雄主义和荣耀的行动。许多人选择在阿卡迪亚的道路上传播这些故事，在黑暗时期保持英雄的精神，在和平时期庆祝它。还有一些人寻求成为自己的英雄，或者激励其他人这样做，做出伟大的事迹。",
	"Arkadian bards have strong ties not only to Illyria but to the hill dwarves and Phaedran who live there as well, and many of the greatest bards are among their number. Their natural powers of enchantment are akin to those of the Fae, and Phaedran take to the bard's life more naturally than most. Many of the more mischievous bards honor Phaedrus alongside Lyria, using their powers to liberate others and beguile those who would control them. Bards of the College of Lore are trained in Ithea; owing their powers to Thessa, they are bent on uncovering Arkadia's secrets. Bards can also be found on the battlefield, the boldest and most valorous inspiring the armies of Hyperius with sword and song.": "阿卡德吟游诗人不仅与伊利里亚有着紧密的联系，而且与居住在那里的山地矮人和费德兰也有着紧密的联系，许多最伟大的吟游诗人都在他们之中。他们天生的魔法能力与异族相似，而费德兰比大多数人更自然地接受吟游诗人的生活。许多更调皮的吟游诗人将辉德鲁斯与莉雅一起敬重，用他们的力量解放他人，欺骗那些想控制他们的人。罗尔学院的吟游诗人在伊蒂亚接受训练；由于他们的力量来自忒萨，他们一心想要揭开阿卡迪亚的秘密。吟游诗人也可以在战场上找到，最大胆和最英勇的人用剑和歌声激励着希佩里乌斯的军队。",

	"The Circle of Beasts are the druids of Phaedrus, trickster god of change and passion. Like their patron, they seek to stir the animal instinct in those around them, eager to remind mortals that they are in fact beasts, full of feral desire bubbling just below the surface. They are experts at bringing this desire out, whether through wine, subtle trickery, or a gentle nudge in the right direction. They are often mysterious figures, traveling the wild places alone or in the company of Fae and beasts, until they sense their services are needed. Then they emerge from the forest, bringing revels to a returning army or farming village exhausted from long labor, rivers of wine to the thirsty, bounteous feasts to the hungry, and, when required, punishment to the rigid and oppressive, those rulers whose love of order and deprivation become too strong. Such druids are feared by tyrants across Arkadia, for there are tales of such wanderers—Phaedrus themself in disguise—who tear them down from their thrones and remind them what they are, often by turning them into whatever beast they seem most like, humiliating them and stripping them of power for their own good and the good of Arkadia.": "野兽之环是辉德鲁斯的德鲁伊，他是变化和激情的诡计之神。就像他们的守护者一样，他们试图激起周围人的动物本能，渴望提醒凡人他们其实也是野兽，充满野性的欲望就在表面之下涌动。他们是激发这种欲望的专家，无论是通过酒、微妙的诡计，还是在正确的方向上轻轻一推。他们通常是神秘的人物，独自在野外旅行，或与异种和野兽为伴，直到他们感到需要他们的服务。然后他们从森林中走出来，为归来的军队或因长期劳动而疲惫不堪的农庄带来狂欢，为口渴的人带来酒河，为饥饿的人带来丰盛的宴席，并在需要时，惩罚那些僵化和压迫的人，那些对秩序和剥夺的热爱变得过于强烈的统治者。阿卡迪亚各地的暴君都惧怕这样的德鲁伊，因为有这样的流浪者--费德鲁斯本人的伪装--的故事，他们把他们从宝座上拆下来，提醒他们自己是什么，通常是把他们变成他们看起来最像的任何野兽，为了他们自己和阿卡迪亚的利益，羞辱他们并剥夺他们的权力。",
	"Though Phaedrus calls to all, many of their druids are hill dwarves and Phaedran, and the hills of Illyria are lush with their blessings. Druids of the Circle of the Land often follow Thessa, and are bound to the sea and its secret power, living solitary lives along the coasts and among the islands. Druids who take the form of powerful beasts under the moon often hunt in Oreya's name.": "虽然辉德鲁斯向所有人发出召唤，但他们的许多德鲁伊都是山地矮人和辉德兰人，伊利里亚的山地因他们的祝福而变得郁郁葱葱。陆地之环的德鲁伊常常追随塞萨，与大海和它的秘密力量联系在一起，沿着海岸和岛屿之间过着孤独的生活。在月下化身为强大野兽的德鲁伊们经常以奥瑞亚的名义狩猎。",

Often they are not Arkadians at all but helots, captured slaves or criminals trying to earn their citizenship and freedom through bloody service on the sands of the coliseum, or as private performers or personal guards.

Her assassins and spies armed with poisoned daggers and venomous words spread her dark influence through the veins of the land, working from the shadows of every city.": "在这些军团的指挥下，她对所有的凡人世界都有企图，阿卡迪亚是她的得意之宝。她的刺客和间谍拿着带毒的匕首和毒舌，在这片土地的血管中传播她的黑暗影响，在每座城市的阴影下工作。",
	"Where guile fails her she seeks domination through strength, sending her enslaved hordes and serpentine abominations crashing against a wall of Krytan shields and spears.": "在诡计失败的地方，她寻求通过力量来统治，让她的奴隶群和蛇形憎恶撞上克里特人的盾牌和长矛的墙壁。",
	"The Maw, a creature of unfathomable scale, waits beneath the waves, down where the ocean is vast and dark and still, deep in the recesses of that abyssal void. Wounded by Thessa's Trident at Scyllaea's fall, the creature writhes in the depths, always in pain, always hungry, black blood pluming out into the sea from a wound that never heals.": "大嘴，一种深不可测的生物，在海浪下等待着，在海洋广阔、黑暗和静止的地方，在那深渊的深处。在希拉里亚陷落时被塞萨的三叉戟所伤，这个生物在深海中挣扎，总是痛苦，总是饥饿，黑色的血液从永不愈合的伤口中喷出，流入大海。",
	"Some sailors claim she rises as a great whirlpool, ringed by the deep shadows of a thousand tendrils, out beyond the end of the sea where waterfalls cascade past flesh and endless rows of jagged teeth, drinking in the sea and hungering to swallow all the world. Others know this to be just a tale, for when the Maw rises, all the world will drown. A great wave will take the land, and all will be as Scyllaea, lost beneath the waves.": "一些水手声称，她升起时是一个巨大的漩涡，被无数卷须的深邃阴影所环抱，在海的尽头之外，那里的瀑布经过肉体和无尽的锯齿排，喝下大海，渴望吞噬所有世界。其他人知道这只是一个故事，因为当大嘴升起时，所有的世界都会被淹没。一个巨大的波浪将带走陆地，所有的人都将像希拉里亚一样，消失在波浪之下。",
	"The Maw's blood, black as ink, billows out into the sea, polluting the tides of Arkadia. Sailors call it the black tide, an oily sheen upon the waves. When it comes, so too do the servants of the Maw—Merrow, twisted merfolk born of drowned men, who raid ship and shore and drag mortals, live and screaming, down into the cold silence of the deep. Other creatures of the deep are drawn by the tide, heralds of destruction feared by sailor and siren alike. Some say the are the children of the Maw; others that they were once beasts, now twisted by her blood, leviathans from ancient times whose tentacles can crack ships and splinter stone.": "大嘴的血，像墨水一样黑，流向大海，污染了阿卡迪亚的潮汐。水手们称它为黑潮，在海浪上泛着油亮的光泽。当它来的时候，Maw-Merrow的仆人也来了，他们是溺水者所生的扭曲的人鱼，他们袭击船只和海岸，把凡人，活生生的和尖叫的，拖入深海的冷寂中。其他深海生物也被潮水吸引，他们是水手和海妖都害怕的毁灭使者。有人说他们是大口的孩子；还有人说他们曾经是野兽，现在被大口的血液扭曲了，他们是来自远古时代的暴君，他们的触角可以击碎船只和劈开石头。",
	"The Worm is dead, slain by Crixys in their fierce battle beneath the world. Though only its dry husk remains, it whispers still, worshiped in Nys as a dead god. It promises power, eternal life, for those who would serve it. Nyssian drow long ago struck this bargain, trading their mortality for something more. Their priests place their organs in canopic jars of stone, filled with the coagulated ichor of the Worm, neither dead nor living, but suspended in between. They pledge their lands and their peoples to the service of the Worm.": "虫子已经死了，在他们在世界地下的激烈战斗中被克雷斯杀死了。虽然只剩下干瘪的躯壳，但它仍在低语，在奈斯被当作死神来崇拜。它承诺为那些愿意为它服务的人提供力量和永恒的生命。尼斯的乌鸦很久以前就达成了这个交易，用他们的死亡换取更多东西。他们的祭司将自己的器官放在石罐里，里面装满了虫子凝固的汁液，既不是死人也不是活人，而是悬浮在两者之间。他们把自己的土地和人民都交给了虫族的服务。",
	"Ever does the Worm thirst to live again. It seeks resurrection, through the actions of those that serve it. From it came the blight that dried Nys, withering its once fertile lands to dust and sand. The bones of their vast civilization lie half buried beneath the dunes, ancient tunnels and tombs giving way to yawning caves, carved ages ago by tireless jaws. This is where the drow dwell. They serve their pharaohs, powerful undying necromancers eternally bound to the Worm.": "虫子永远渴望重生。它通过那些为它服务的人的行为寻求复活。从它那里传来了使尼斯干涸的瘟疫，使它曾经肥沃的土地枯萎为尘土和沙子。他们庞大的文明的骨头半埋在沙丘下，古老的隧道和坟墓让位于巨大的洞穴，这些洞穴是由不知疲倦的大颚在很久以前雕刻而成的。这就是乌鸦居住的地方。他们为他们的法老服务，这些强大的不死的死灵法师永远与虫子联系在一起。",
	"Feeding on the lifeforce of land and creature, the Worm drank deep. Now an insatiable blight spreads across a dead sea to Arkadia, a festering plague upon its shores. And as the land decays, the dead rise; a symptom, perhaps, of the Worm's occult design. Fae are twisted by its curse, and mortals fall sick, only to return as shambling husks or silent shades, robbed of their mortal rest.": "虫子以陆地和生物的生命力为食，深深地喝了下去。现在，一种贪得无厌的枯萎病穿过死海蔓延到阿卡迪亚，在其海岸上形成一种溃烂的瘟疫。随着土地的腐烂，死人不断增加；这也许是虫子的神秘设计的症状。异族被它的诅咒所扭曲，凡人生病，只是作为摇摇欲坠的躯壳或沉默的阴影回来，被剥夺了他们的凡人休息。",
	"Hyperium is the oldest and greatest of all the cities of Arkadia. Legend holds that this sacred mountain was the birthplace of mankind, where the first men walked in the footsteps of the gods.": "Hyperium是阿卡迪亚所有城市中最古老和最伟大的城市。传说中，这座圣山是人类的发源地，第一批人在这里踏着众神的脚步。",
	"Mount Hyperius, crested in snow, rises above the dry hills at the bosom of Arkadia. At its base, ascending its rocky slopes into the very mountain, is carved the city that shares its name. It is an awesome sight to behold, white marble columns and polished stone, a peerless work shaped by the dwarves of Erebos as symbol of their brotherhood with the mortals of Arkadia.": "希佩里乌斯山，白雪皑皑，耸立在阿卡迪亚腹地的干燥山丘之上。在它的山脚下，沿着岩石的山坡往上爬，雕刻着与它同名的城市。这是一个令人敬畏的景象，白色的大理石柱和抛光的石头，是埃雷波斯的矮人塑造的无以伦比的作品，象征着他们与阿卡迪亚凡人的兄弟关系。",
	"Above the stone houses and streets, steps as wide as an army are cut into the rock, leading up the stern face ofthe mountain. There, above the clouds crowning the summit of the highest peak, sits the Pantheon of the Gods, its gilded dome shining in the light of the sun. Beyond bronze doors bearing reliefs of the deeds of the heroes of yore, is the chamber of the gods.": "在石屋和街道的上方，岩石上凿出了像军队一样宽的台阶，通往山的严酷面孔。在最高峰顶的云层之上，坐落着众神殿，其镀金的圆顶在阳光下闪闪发光。在印有过去英雄事迹浮雕的青铜门外，是众神的房间。",
	"Sunlight streams through the circular opening at the dome's center, falling in turn on each of the gods of Arkadia as the sun marks its eternal gyre. They are carved in marble, adorned in gold: Krytos, Thessa, Crixys, Erebos, Oreya, and Hyperion himself upon his throne. Here many pilgrims come from all the corners of Arkadia, to leave tribute on the marble plinths before the gods.": "阳光透过穹顶中心的圆形开口，依次落在阿卡迪亚的每一位神灵身上，如同太阳划出的永恒的旋涡。他们被雕刻在大理石上，用黄金装饰。Krytos, Thessa, Crixys, Erebos, Oreya, 和Hyperion本人在他的王座上。许多朝圣者从阿卡迪亚的各个角落来到这里，在众神面前的大理石基座上留下贡品。",
	"It is here the king of Hyperium holds his court, his throne upon the base of Hyperius' statue, and one for each of the leaders of the other great cities. Not for an age has such a council been called, when the leaders of all Arkadia met on that high mountain in the presence of the gods.": "希佩里姆的国王就在这里举行他的法庭，他的宝座在希佩里姆雕像的底座上，其他伟大城市的领导人也各有一个。这样的会议已经很久没有召开了，当时整个阿卡迪亚的领导人都在那座高山上与众神会面。",
	"Through a chasm cleft in the rocks, there is a small and ancient shrine atop the mountain. There lives the Oracle, a Scyllaean elf born with the gift of sight. Her low pillared hall is draped in translucent silks, seeming to mingle with the smoke of censers burning amber and incense. There she mutters prophecy, always whispering; from her spill the secrets of the gods. Kings and heroes come from across the land to hear her speak omens and riddles, that they might divine something of their fate.": "穿过岩石上裂开的鸿沟，在山顶上有一个小而古老的神殿。那里住着神谕师，一个生来就有视觉天赋的西莱亚精灵。她低矮的长廊大厅里铺着半透明的丝绸，似乎与燃烧着琥珀和香的炉子的烟雾混在一起。她在那里喃喃预言，总是轻声细语；从她口中吐出众神的秘密。国王和英雄们从各地赶来，听她说预兆和谜语，以便他们能预知自己的命运。",
	"While the matters of kings are met in the Pantheon, matters of the people are settled on the Forum, an outcropping carved from a ledge in the stone of the cliff halfway up the mountainside, whose pillared arches look out upon all Arkadia. It is to the polished marble floors of the Forum, worn smooth by many sandaled feet, that the common folk come to to seek their justice. They travel long, philosophers, farmers and hoplites alike. They come to seek the authority of Hyperium. There, they seek justice for wrongdoings, have disputes settled, and agreements drawn. From trade contracts between cities to the trials of petty thieves, the Forum bears them all.": "国王的事情在万神殿解决，而人民的事情则在论坛上解决，论坛是在半山腰的悬崖石壁上雕刻出来的，其柱状拱门可以看到整个阿卡迪亚。在论坛的抛光大理石地板上，许多人的脚都被磨得很光滑，普通人都来寻求他们的正义。他们长途跋涉，哲学家、农民和跳梁小丑都是如此。他们来寻求希佩里姆的权威。在那里，他们为错误的行为寻求正义，解决争端，并达成协议。从城市间的贸易合同到对小贼的审判，论坛都承担着这一切。",
	"At the base of the mountain, where the earth levels and the flat-roofed huts of common folk rest, is the track. Part amphitheatre, part arena, it is a long dusty track ringed with tiered stone seats. Here grand chariot races are held throughout the year. Once every four years, a great games is held. There all Arkadians are welcome to compete, regardless of city or status. They compete in feats of strength and skill until a victor emerges, laurelcrowned—their prize a single favor from the king.": "在山脚下，大地平坦，老百姓的平顶小屋在那里休息，这就是轨道。部分是圆形剧场，部分是竞技场，它是一条长长的尘土飞扬的跑道，周围是层层叠叠的石质座椅。这里一年四季都会举行盛大的战车比赛。每四年举行一次大型运动会。在那里，所有的阿卡德人都可以参加比赛，不管是哪个城市或哪个身份。他们在力量和技巧方面进行竞争，直到一个胜利者出现，获得桂冠--他们的奖品是国王的一个恩惠。",
	"Consuls are champions chosen from the army's elite. They are appointed by the king not only for their martial skill, but also for their excellence as citizens and devotion to their king, the gods, and Arkadia. Granted the authority to speak as ambassadors of the king, they travel the land settling disputes among the common folk in small villages, imbued with the powers of judge, jury, and executioner.": "执政官是从军队的精英中选出的冠军。他们被国王任命，不仅是因为他们的武功，还因为他们作为公民的卓越表现，以及对国王、众神和阿卡迪亚的奉献。他们被授予作为国王的大使发言的权力，他们在这片土地上旅行，解决小村庄里普通人的争端，被赋予了法官、陪审团和刽子手的权力。",
	"Each city has its own laws, but all begrudgingly accept the acords set forth by Hyperium, acknowledging the wisdom and strength of its king. As such, consuls experience a mixed reception, even by those in need of their aid. Some consuls abuse their power, while others truly seek to bring justice.": "每个城市都有自己的法律，但都勉强接受Hyperium制定的协议，承认其国王的智慧和力量。因此，执政官们受到了不同程度的欢迎，即使是那些需要他们帮助的人也是如此。一些执政官滥用他们的权力，而另一些执政官则真正寻求正义。",
	"The symbol of the consuls is the pegasus, a silver winged horse emblazoned on their shields and armor. It is said they once flew on such magnificent creatures, though now they are rumored to be extinct.": "执政官的象征是飞马，一匹银色的飞马被印在他们的盾牌和盔甲上。据说他们曾经骑着这种壮丽的动物飞行，尽管现在传言它们已经灭绝。",
	"To the north lies Gargaros, a blasted wasteland of ashcovered ruins. The barren volcanic landscape is sundered by cracks and fissures from which seep the blood of the earth. The land was destroyed by the fires of the Great Hydra as he and Hyperius battled with thunder and flame. Though bound, shackled by the chains forged by Erebos in the heart of the distant mountain, the Great Hydra is still worshiped by many orc tribes, bent on freeing their master. There the earth quakes and lava flows from ancient wounds as the titan strains against his bonds.": "北面是加尔加罗斯，一个被灰烬覆盖的废墟。荒芜的火山地貌被裂缝和裂隙分割开来，从中渗出了大地的血液。这片土地被大九头蛇的火焰所摧毁，因为他和希佩里乌斯用雷霆和火焰进行了战斗。虽然被埃里伯斯在遥远的山腹中铸造的锁链束缚着，但大九头蛇仍然受到许多兽人部落的崇拜，一心想要解放他们的主人。在那里，大地震颤，熔岩从古老的伤口中流淌出来，因为泰坦正在努力反抗他的束缚。",
	"Hyperium is the spearhead of Arkadia's defense against these foes beyond the mountains. From Gargaros pour giant orcs, cyclopes, and cerberus worgs, bent on the destruction of Arkadia. All along the peaks of the Gargaran mountains stand columned temples to Hyperius, housing signal beacons and companies of hoplites. They keep vigil for the movements of orc hordes in the ashlands bellow. The mountains are vast and treacherous, and small groups of orc reavers often slip through the mountains to pillage the small villages of northern Arkadia and set all before them to the torch.": "Hyperium是阿卡迪亚防御这些山外敌人的先锋。巨大的兽人、独眼巨人和地狱之虫从加尔加罗斯涌来，一心想要毁灭阿卡迪亚。沿着加尔加罗山的山峰，矗立着希佩里乌斯的柱状寺庙，里面有信号灯和跳伞兵连。他们对灰地中兽人群的行动保持警惕。山脉辽阔而险恶，一小群兽人掠夺者经常穿过山脉，掠夺阿卡迪亚北部的小村庄，并将他们面前的一切置于火炬之下。",
	"The main bulwark against the orcs of Gargaros is a single mountain pass known as the Gates of Erebos, barely large enough to take an army across the mountains in force. It passes under the shadow of Kor Erebos, home of the dwarves. The entrance to the pass is carved with a pair of stone colossi, two legendary kings of old, lovers who once held the pass against all odds.": "对抗加尔加罗斯兽人的主要堡垒是一个被称为 \"埃雷波斯之门 \"的单一山口，其规模几乎不足以让一支军队穿越山脉。它在矮人的家园--科尔-埃雷伯斯的阴影下通过。山口的入口处雕刻着一对石雕，那是两位古老的传奇国王，他们是曾经不顾一切守住山口的恋人。",
	"Here Hyperium stand against the endless tide of orcs and other hellish creatures from the blasted land. Armed and armored by the smiths of Erebos and famed for their discipline and coordination, their heavy troops hold the pass. They often stand against overwhelming odds, though not in living memory have the orc tribes united under a single banner.": "在这里，Hyperium抵御着兽人和其他来自爆炸之地的地狱生物的无尽浪潮。他们的重装部队由Erebos的铁匠武装起来，并以其纪律性和协调性而闻名，他们的重装部队守住了这个通道。虽然在人们的记忆中，兽人部落从未在一个单一的旗帜下团结起来，但他们经常面对着压倒性的困难。",
	"Kryta is a land of warriors, renowned for their strength and valor. They are a strong people, said to be descend from Krytos himself. With red cloaks and crested helms, long have their walls of bronze shields and spears held the Psysserian hordes at bay.": "克里塔是一个战士的国度，以其力量和勇气而闻名。他们是一个强大的民族，据说是克里托斯本人的后代。他们披着红色的斗篷，戴着有徽章的头盔，长期以来，他们的青铜盾牌和长矛墙一直在阻挡着普赛尔人的大军。",
	"Past dry rusted hills lie the fields of wheat, golden under the sun. Above them rises a red rock ridge, topped by the thick walls of a citadel cut from stones dark as blood. Its thick stone walls and heavy pillars are scarred with the marks of ancient battles. From its vantage, the arid land can be seen for miles around.": "穿过干燥生锈的山丘，是阳光下金黄的麦田。在它们上面耸立着一座红色的岩石山脊，山顶上是由黑如血的石头切割而成的堡垒的厚墙。其厚实的石墙和沉重的柱子上有古代战斗的痕迹。从它的有利位置，干旱的土地可以看到周围数英里。",
	"The citadel serves both as spartan palace as well as a training ground for the Krytan elite. From the throne or bronze in the red citadel, a mighty king or queen has always ruled Kryta. It is customary for the ruler to share power with their spouse, often a mighty warrior in their own right. Thus Kryta is often ruled by both a king and queen, two kings, or two queens.": "该城堡既是斯巴达的宫殿，也是克里特精英的训练场。在红色城堡的王座或青铜器上，一个强大的国王或女王一直在统治着克里特。按照惯例，统治者会与他们的配偶分享权力，而他们本身往往是一个强大的战士。因此，克里特经常由国王和王后、两个国王或两个王后共同统治。",
	"They say that Krytos himself built the city's mighty walls, moving huge stones from the hills with his bare hands. This fortified wall separates the fields and farmlands from the city at the base of the citadel's escarpment. The walls are made from stacked stones, as are the houses, roofed with fire-hardened clay tiles, that are nestled within. Squat rectangular towers defend the parapets at regular intervals, burning bronze braziers of smoking coals. Hoplites from the many garrisons along the wall's base patrol the battlements.": "他们说克里托斯亲自建造了这座城市强大的城墙，用他的双手从山上搬来巨大的石头。这座坚固的城墙将田地和农田与城市分隔开来，位于城堡的悬崖底部。城墙是由石头堆砌而成的，坐落在里面的房屋也是如此，屋顶是用火硬化的粘土瓦。蹲下的长方形塔楼每隔一段距离就保卫着护栏，燃烧着冒着烟的青铜火盆。来自城墙基座上许多驻军的士兵在城垛上巡逻。",
	"Though many small thatch roofed farmers' huts are scattered across the dry hills and fields of wheat, most Krytans live inside the city's protective walls.": "尽管许多小茅草屋顶的农民小屋散布在干燥的山丘和麦田中，但大多数克里特人居住在城市的保护墙内。",
	"Rising up from among the red stone buildings is the Colosseum, the largest fighting arena in all Arkadia. Carved of immense blocks of stone, its squat arches house tiered rows of stone benches circling a ring of rust-colored sand. There gladiators fight for sport, entertainment, and gold before the cheering of the mob.": "从红石建筑中升起的是斗兽场，这是整个阿卡迪亚最大的战斗场。它由巨大的石块雕刻而成，蹲下的拱门里有一排排的石椅，环绕着一圈铁锈色的沙子。在那里，角斗士们在群众的欢呼声中为运动、娱乐和黄金而战斗。",
	"The Colosseum, as with all arenas, is a sacred space to the Krytans. There combat is dedicated to the glory Krytos. To die in the arena is to die with honor before the gods. Ancient customs allow disputes to be settled upon the arena sands. Any citizen of Kryta may invoke a trial of combat, putting their innocence or guilt before the god Krytos to be weighed in blood.": "斗兽场，和所有的竞技场一样，对克里特人来说是一个神圣的空间。在那里，战斗是为了荣耀的克里托斯。死在竞技场上就是在众神面前光荣地死去。古老的习俗允许在竞技场的沙地上解决争端。克里塔的任何公民都可以要求进行战斗审判，把他们的清白或罪行放在克里托斯神面前，用血来衡量。",
	"Kryta is in a state of perpetual warfare with the invading armies of Psysseria. Though valiant, their forces are never enough to stem the tide of the Psysserian hordes; they are always training new soldiers, always spread too thin. From the fallen ruins of Old Kryta to Illyria, many crumbling citadels hold the land, manned only by a brave few.": "Kryta与Psysseria的入侵军队处于永久的战争状态。虽然英勇，但他们的力量永远不足以阻止普西利亚大军的浪潮；他们总是在训练新的士兵，总是分身乏术。从旧克里塔的废墟到伊利里亚，许多摇摇欲坠的城堡守卫着这片土地，只由少数勇敢的人驻守。",
	"When they are young, each child is taken from their parents to the priests of Kryta. From the poorest farmer to the king's own son, every Krytan is called. Should they be deemed strong in both body and spirit, they are taken to train. It is a great honor to be chosen. From that day, and each day after, for ten years they train. They are taught the spear and shield, to kill with sword and fist, to fight alongside their brethren and alone against all odds.": "当他们年幼时，每个孩子都会从父母那里被带到克里塔的祭司那里。从最贫穷的农民到国王的亲生儿子，每一个克里特人都被召集。如果他们被认为在身体和精神上都很强壮，他们就会被带去训练。被选中是一种巨大的荣誉。从那一天起，以及之后的每一天，他们都要接受十年的训练。他们被教导如何使用长矛和盾牌，如何用剑和拳头杀人，如何与他们的兄弟们并肩作战，如何独自面对一切困难。",
	"When they come of age, they are cast into the wilds for a year and a day, armed only with the iron of their strength and will. The land of Kryta is vast, forged from the shards of ancient conquest, and as violent and unforgiving as its people. Its scarred rocky hills are stained with the blood of many battles. The caves and clefts of blasted red rock are home to beast and fae alike, wolf and manticore, roc and harpy. Should a youth return, they do so a true Krytan.": "当他们成年后，他们被扔到荒野里一年零一天，只用他们的力量和意志的铁来武装。克里塔的土地很辽阔，由古代征服的碎片铸成，和它的人民一样暴力和无情。它伤痕累累的岩石山丘上沾满了许多战斗的鲜血。被炸毁的红色岩石的洞穴和裂缝是野兽和异种的家园，狼和刺尾狮，大鹏和鹞鹰。如果一个年轻人回到这里，他们会成为真正的克里坦人。",
	"Those who cannot fight and don't have great name to fall back on are sent to help the war in other ways. They are tasked to forge weapons, build walls, or tend to the endless fields of grain that keep the Krytan army alive.": "那些不能打仗又没有大名可依的人被派去以其他方式帮助战争。他们的任务是锻造武器，建造城墙，或照料无尽的谷物田，以维持克里坦军队的生存。",
	"Orcs, originally brought to Kryta in chains, now live, fight, and die alongside their human brethren. The bond between these kindred races was forged in the crucible of a hundred wars, fought shoulder to shoulder against a common foe. Now they share the deep and mutual respect of seasoned veterans.": "半兽人最初被锁在克里特，现在与他们的人类兄弟一起生活、战斗和死亡。这些同类种族之间的纽带是在上百场战争的熔炉中锻造出来的，他们并肩作战，对抗共同的敌人。现在，他们分享着经验丰富的老兵的深刻和相互尊重。",
	"They are gladiators, mercenaries and hoplites, any profession that commands strength of arm and love of force. There are many half-orcs in Kryta, and many a human can claim with pride to have a drop of orc blood in their veins.": "他们是角斗士、雇佣兵和跳伞兵，任何需要武装力量和热爱武力的职业。克里塔有许多半兽人，许多人类可以自豪地声称他们的血管里有一滴兽人的血。",
	"Krytan mercenaries are famed for their strength and honor. They are said never to break a contract once taken. Many bands of warriors exist, comprised of Krytan warriors who seek gold and glory. Such bands often earn fierce reputations, and can be distinguished by the symbols on their shield, such as a minotaur, siren, or lion. Famous among them are the Sisters, a band of mostly female warriors who wear a harpy upon their shields. Another is the Sons of Phaedrus, an elite group of bastard Phaedran who bear a ram's head upon their shields. The Scorpions are sellswords who specialize in fighting the undead; they work near Crixos and are famous for their expeditions across the sea to Nys.": "Krytan雇佣兵以其力量和荣誉而闻名。据说他们一旦签订了合同就不会毁约。存在许多由寻求黄金和荣誉的克里坦战士组成的武士团。这样的队伍常常赢得激烈的声誉，可以通过他们盾牌上的标志来区分，如牛头人、海妖或狮子。其中著名的是姐妹会，一个主要由女战士组成的队伍，他们在盾牌上佩戴着海妖的图案。另一个是斐德鲁斯之子，一个由斐德兰私生子组成的精英团体，他们的盾牌上有一个公羊的头。蝎子军团是专门与亡灵作战的军火商；他们在克雷斯附近工作，因跨海远征奈斯而闻名。",
	"The ruins of Old Kryta stand to the east, a shameful reminder of Kryta's greatest defeat. Long fallen to the Psysserians, its tumbled walls and fallen columns are overgrown. It stands silent, filled with the crumbling statues of its last defenders. Among the stones slither the serpentine offspring of the Mother of Monsters.": "旧克里塔的废墟矗立在东边，可耻地提醒着克里塔最大的失败。长期以来，它已沦为赛亚人的天下，翻倒的墙壁和倒下的柱子都长满了杂草。它静静地矗立着，到处都是最后的保卫者们摇摇欲坠的雕像。在石头中，怪物之母的蛇形后代在蠕动着。",
	"Gorgons, the daughters of the monstrous queen, lead vast armies against Kryta. They control elite gorgon Phaedran, fanatics of their serpent mother's cult. They are spies, emissaries, and commanders, fighting with poisoned blades and words. Their whips drive hordes of slaves—the broken humans of Psysseria, armed with spears and wicker shields—seeking to overthrow Kryta with sheer numbers where the guile of their mistress fails.": "戈尔贡人是畸形女王的女儿，他们带领庞大的军队对抗克里塔。他们控制着精锐的戈尔贡人Phaedran，是他们蛇母崇拜的狂热者。她们是间谍、使者和指挥官，用毒刃和语言作战。他们的鞭子驱使成群的奴隶--普西利亚的残破人类，用长矛和柳条盾牌武装起来--寻求在他们的女主人的诡计失败后，用纯粹的数量来推翻克里塔。",
	"Ithea is a city of sailors and philosophers who study the lost mystical arts. Beyond the gold of arid hills, the crescent arms of fair cliffs embrace the gentle break of waves; there, below the headland fields, on white rock and white sand, rests Ithea, a jewel upon the sea.": "伊蒂亚是一个水手和哲学家的城市，他们研究失落的神秘艺术。在干旱山丘的黄金地带之外，美丽悬崖的新月臂膀拥抱着波浪的轻柔断裂；在岬角田野之下，在白色的岩石和白色的沙子上，安放着伊蒂亚，是海上的一颗宝石。",
	"White plastered houses line the ridges of the cliffs, the shore, and the sheltered bay.

	"Long, wide granite quays extend from the shore for ships to dock. There harbors a fleet of mighty triremes, blue eyes painted on their green-bronze prows, sails painted with Thessa's Trident. Beside them is a shipyard, where the wooden bones of fresh ships are given life. At many of the stone plinths are moored ships from every corner of Arkadia. There are berthed the small ships of Illyrian merchants, heaped with silks and spices, amphora of wine and olive oil. Next to them, penteconters of Krytan mercenaries, loud and boisterous. They mingle with the vessels of Ithean explorers and black-sailed Cryxian envoys.": "长而宽的花岗岩码头从岸边延伸出来供船只停靠。那里停泊着一支强大的三桅船队，青铜色的船桨上画着蓝色的眼睛，船帆上画着塞萨的三叉戟。在它们旁边是一个造船厂，新船的木骨在那里被赋予生命。在许多石柱上，停泊着来自阿卡迪亚各个角落的船只。那里停泊着伊利里亚商人的小船，上面堆满了丝绸和香料、葡萄酒和橄榄油的瓶罐。在他们旁边，是克里特雇佣兵的五角船，吵吵嚷嚷的。他们与伊蒂亚探险家的船只和黑帆的克里西亚使节混在一起。",

Though worn by wind and sea, she towers above the bay, her trident blackened by salt and time.": "港湾的入口处有两座灯塔，横跨缺口的是一尊用白石雕刻的塞萨的巨大雕像。虽然被风和海所磨损，但她仍然耸立在海湾之上，她的三叉戟被盐和时间染黑。",
	"The towers at her sides hold bronze braziers, burning with undying flames, made by the philosophers of old to never burn out, even unto sea water or storm wind. Huge bronze mirrors house them and direct their light upon the sea-gate, the safe passage into the harbor beneath Thessa—the only entrance to the sea-walled port.": "她两侧的塔楼上放着青铜火炉，燃烧着不灭的火焰，这是古代哲学家们的杰作，即使遇到海水或暴风也不会烧毁。巨大的铜镜容纳着它们，并将它们的光照向海门，那是进入塞萨城下港口的安全通道--进入海墙港口的唯一入口。",
	"Out beyond the harbor, beyond the colossal statue of Thessa, in the sea itself is a small rocky island, and upon it a round temple, domed in blackened silver tarnished by the sea. To the boulders of its shores cling barnacles and green slime, for when the tide is high it covers the rocks and laps at the very pillars of the temple walls. Yet when the tide is low, a carved path of rock is revealed, and one may appear to walk across the waves, from the city out into the sea.": "在港口之外，在忒萨的巨像之外，海里有一个小石岛，上面有一个圆形的庙宇，圆顶上有被海水染黑的银色。岸边的巨石上粘着藤壶和绿色的粘液，因为涨潮时，它覆盖着岩石，拍打着寺庙墙壁的支柱。然而，当潮水退去时，一条雕刻好的岩石路径就会显现出来，人们似乎可以穿过波浪，从城市中走到海里。",
	"At the heart of Ithea rises a high hill whose white marble walls are steep from centuries of quarrying. It is crowned by an Acropolis, a columned temple, rising above the rest of the city. A thing of wonder, it bears no mason marks, no signs of chisel or dwarven hands. It is made from a single piece of marble as if grown from the stone. It is said that the first philosophers made it so, shaped it from the marble peak upon which it now stands. Inside its pillared square is an agora, a meeting place for the consuls, the head philosophers, elected by the people to rule the city.": "在伊蒂亚的中心，耸立着一座高高的山丘，白色的大理石墙因几个世纪的采石而变得陡峭。山顶上有一座卫城，一座有柱子的寺庙，耸立在城市的其他地方。这是一个奇迹，它没有石匠的痕迹，没有凿子或矮人的痕迹。它是由一块大理石制成的，仿佛是从石头里长出来的。据说最早的哲学家把它做成这样，从它现在所处的大理石山峰上塑造出来。在它的柱状广场内有一个广场，是执政官、首席哲学家的聚会场所，他们由人民选出来统治这个城市。",
	"At the center of the Acropolis rests the Synian Stone. It is a fragment of a ruined wall, sundered in two, and lined with cracks. Its is the key to all written magic, a stone from lost Scyellaea, an ancient city sunk beneath the waves. From this stone and the teachings of the Scyllaean elves, those few who survived its cataclysmic end, Arkadians learned the arcane arts, those secrets of the gods. Some say the Scyllaean elves brought the stone as a gift when they fled their lost home. Philosophers have added to the stone over the centuries, carving onto it new spells they have learned. As such it represents the values of Ithea, knowledge, exploration, and magic.": "在雅典卫城的中心有一块叙利亚石。它是一堵废墙的碎片，被拆成两半，上面布满裂缝。它是所有书面魔法的关键，是一块来自失落的锡耶利亚的石头，一个沉没在海浪之下的古城。从这块石头和Scyllaean精灵的教导中，阿卡德人学会了神秘的艺术，那些神的秘密。有人说，西莱亚精灵在逃离他们失去的家园时，把这块石头作为礼物带来了。几个世纪以来，哲学家们在这块石头上添砖加瓦，把他们学到的新咒语刻在上面。因此，它代表了伊蒂亚的价值观、知识、探索和魔法。",
	"Many smaller fragments remain, in the drowned ruins of lost Scyllaea. Bold philosophers, explorers, and treasure seekers venture out into the islands, all that remain of a once grand civilization, in search of its ancient mysteries. There are tales of a library filled with stone tablets, the secrets of Scyllaea, now lost forever beneath the waves. Ithean philosophers have spread their teachings throughout Arkadia. Some look upon their magic with disdain, such as the Krytans, though many welcome their schools. Training at the Hyperian school is seen as a mark of prestige for the Arkadian elite, while the Cryxian school studies forbidden magics, offering shelter to those exiled from the other colleges.": "在被淹没的斯库拉岛的废墟上，还有许多较小的碎片。大胆的哲学家、探险家和寻宝者冒险进入这些岛屿，这是一个曾经的伟大文明的全部遗迹，以寻找其古老的奥秘。传说有一个图书馆，里面装满了石板，是斯西拉亚的秘密，现在永远消失在海浪之下。伊提安的哲学家们将他们的教义传播到整个阿卡迪亚。有些人对他们的魔法不屑一顾，例如克里坦人，但许多人欢迎他们的学校。在海伯利安学校的训练被视为阿卡迪亚精英阶层的威望标志，而克里森学校则研究被禁止的魔法，为那些从其他学院流放出来的人提供庇护。",
	"Ithea prides itself as a democracy, set apart from the kings and queens of their neighboring city-states. All Ithean citizens can vote on large matters such as war or trade. An elected senate of consuls oversees the rule of the city. These consuls are elected based on their popularity, wealth, influence, and arcane power.": "伊蒂亚为自己是一个民主国家而自豪，它与邻近城邦的国王和王后不同。所有伊蒂亚公民都可以对战争或贸易等重大事项进行投票。一个由执政官组成的民选议会负责监督城市的统治。这些执政官是根据他们的声望、财富、影响力和神秘的力量选出来的。",
	"While Ithea prides itself on its progressive system of government, Kryta mocks them for their weak leaders, while Hyperium fears the rule of the mob. Whether these criticisms are justified, Ithean democracy is certainly flawed. Only citizens may vote, and to be a citizen one must be able to perform magic. A citizen does not need to be a philosopher, wholly devoted to the study of magic, but they must exhibit some ability. Thus it is frequently only an elite few, those with wealth or status, who are considered citizens and allowed to have a hand in deciding the fate of the city.": "当伊蒂亚以其进步的政府体系为荣时，克里塔嘲笑他们的领导人软弱无能，而希佩里姆则害怕暴民的统治。无论这些批评是否有道理，伊蒂亚的民主肯定是有缺陷的。只有公民可以投票，而且要成为公民，必须能够施展魔法。一个公民不需要是一个哲学家，完全致力于研究魔法，但他们必须表现出某种能力。因此，经常只有少数精英，那些拥有财富或地位的人被视为公民，并被允许参与决定城市的命运。",
	"Before all else, Ithea is a city of the sea. Sailors make up the bulk of her population, from merchants to fishermen and explorers. In the shallow blue waters of her safe harbor are built the finest ships in all Arkadia. The city is protected by a large navy of triremes, their sails painted with Thessa's Trident.": "在其他方面，伊蒂亚是一座海洋之城。从商人到渔民和探险家，水手们构成了她人口的主体。在她安全港湾的蓝色浅水区，建造着整个阿卡迪亚最优秀的船只。这座城市由一支庞大的三桅船海军保护，船帆上绘有塞萨的三叉戟。",
	"Most ships stay close to the shore; even merchant vessels bound for Crixos or Illyria follow the coast and shun open waters. Some brave, foolish, or desperate crews travel to the shattered islands off Arkadia's western shore. Dozens of small rocky islands lay scattered off the coast, covered in ancient elven ruins. This is all that remains of Scyllaea, a once splendorous civilization of elves, sunk beneath the sea. Some travel there in search of power or fortune, lost treasures of tarnished silver and pearls, or—more valuable still—fragments of tablets containing lost secrets from the age of gods.": "大多数船只都靠近海岸；即使是前往克雷斯或伊利里亚的商船也会沿着海岸线行驶，避开开放水域。一些勇敢的、愚蠢的或绝望的船员则前往阿卡迪亚西岸的破碎岛屿。几十个小石岛散落在海岸边，被古老的精灵遗迹所覆盖。这就是斯西拉亚的全部遗迹，一个曾经辉煌的精灵文明，沉入了海底。有些人去那里寻找权力或财富，寻找丢失的银器和珍珠的宝藏，或者--更有价值的是--包含诸神时代丢失的秘密的石板碎片。",
	"Whatever drives sailors to brave these flooded ruins, there is a single sight into which no Ithean captain will sail—the black tide. They say it is the blood of the titan; wounded by Ithea's very trident, it still bleeds its black blood, seeping up from the abyssal depths. With it come monsters from the deep: kraken, whose horrible tendrils can crush whole ships, and their servants the merrow. Many a ship has been swarmed by these twisted men of the sea, who can slither onto deck or land to capture humans with their tridents and nets, dragging them back into the depths from which they came. Some sailors say they eat those they take, feasting on them in bloody waters with their rows of shark-like teeth. Others say they drag them down, down into the black crushing cold of the abyssal depths where they are fed, in the alien silence of that void, to the final blackness of a titanic maw.": "无论驱使水手们在这些被洪水淹没的废墟上冒险，有一个景象是任何伊蒂亚的船长都不会驶入的--黑色的潮水。他们说这是泰坦的血；被伊蒂亚的三叉戟所伤，它仍然流着黑血，从深渊中渗出。随之而来的是来自深海的怪物：海怪，其可怕的卷须可以压碎整艘船，还有它们的仆人--人鱼。许多船只都被这些扭曲的海中人所包围，他们可以爬上甲板或陆地，用他们的长矛和渔网捕捉人类，把他们拖回他们来时的深处。一些水手说，他们把抓来的人吃掉，在血腥的水面上用他们那一排鲨鱼般的牙齿大吃特吃。还有人说，它们把人拖下去，拖到深渊的黑压压的寒气中，在那异样的寂静中，它们被喂养到最后的黑压压的泰坦巨口中。",
	"The sailors tell many tales of the titan defeated by Thessa. They say that when the sea grows violent, when the storms and waves hammer ships and shore, it is the anger of the titan thrashing beneath the sea. They say that if you could manage to sail past the ruins of Scyllaea, into the westernmost regions of the Arkadian sea, there you would find the Maw as a great whirlpool at the world's end, unquenchable and insatiable, drinking in the sea. Whether there is truth to these tales, none can say, for no ships that have sailed beyond the ruins of Scyllaea have ever returned.": "水手们讲述了许多关于泰坦被塞萨打败的故事。他们说，当大海变得狂暴时，当风暴和海浪敲击船只和海岸时，那是泰坦在海下的愤怒。他们说，如果你能设法驶过希拉里亚的废墟，进入阿卡迪亚海的最西边区域，你会发现大嘴就像世界尽头的一个巨大漩涡，永不停息，贪得无厌，在海中畅饮。这些传说是否属实，没有人能够说得清，因为没有任何船只在斯凯莱亚的废墟之外航行过，也没有回来。",
	"The islands of Scyllaea's ruins can be seen from the shores of Ithea. The sun sets behind the silhouette of broken pillars and tumbled walls, all that remains of a once proud and mighty civilization of elves. Some sailors say the islands change; some sink and some rise, always changing.": "从Ithea海岸可以看到Scyllaea岛屿的废墟。夕阳在断裂的柱子和倒塌的墙壁的剪影后面落下，那是一个曾经骄傲而强大的精灵文明的全部遗迹。一些水手说，这些岛屿在不断变化；有的下沉，有的上升，一直在变化。",
	"Many of the ruins rise and sink with the tide, or become lost in the thick mist that often clings to that part of the sea. The ruins are slick with green sea slime, toppled pillars are crusted in barnacles and brine, and the broken stone statues of ancient elves are worn faceless by the sea. Scyllaean elves once dwelled in this place, and when the gods were young and walked the earth, it was a city unequaled in its splendor. Arkadians say it was lost, drowned in that terrible battle between Thessa and the titan, sunk beneath the waves. Some Scyllaean elves fled this cataclysm and sought refuge among the young race of mortals, bringing with them a dowry of arcane knowledge, a fraction of the secrets of their kind.": "许多废墟随着潮水涨落，或者迷失在经常附着在那片海域的浓雾中。废墟上沾满了绿色的海泥，倒下的柱子上结满了藤壶和盐水，古代精灵的碎石雕像被海水冲得面目全非。Scyllaean精灵曾经居住在这个地方，当诸神年轻时在地球上行走时，它是一个无与伦比的城市，它的辉煌。阿卡德人说它已经消失了，淹没在塞萨和泰坦之间那场可怕的战斗中，沉入了海浪之下。一些西莱亚精灵逃离了这场大灾难，在年轻的凡人种族中寻求庇护，他们带来了奥术知识的嫁妆，是他们同类秘密的一小部分。",
	"There is an ancient prophecy, given by the Oracle of Crixos, that the day will come when Scyllaea rises from the depths, when a great waves sweeps the land, and all the world is drowned.": "有一个古老的预言，由Crixos的神谕给出，当Scyllaea从深处升起，当大浪席卷大地，所有的世界被淹没的那一天将会到来。",
	"Crixos, once counted among the most sacred sites in all Arkadia, has been defiled by a plague of undeath. Now the city and the forest around it rot like the carcass of a great beast. Lead roofed houses and temples of dark stone stand empty, their timbers gnawed by decay. Half the city, east of the River Cryx, stands abandoned, the bridges barricaded. That bank has been lost to the dead, a symptom of the plague. The city's living bank is ringed by a hastily built wall, reinforced with crumbled masonry and shored-up rubble, broken statues and columns from crumbling temples.": "Crixos，曾经是整个阿卡迪亚最神圣的地方之一，被不死之身的瘟疫所玷污。现在，这座城市和它周围的森林像一只巨大野兽的尸体一样腐烂。铅顶的房屋和黑石的寺庙空空如也，它们的木材被腐烂所啃噬。一半的城市，在Cryx河以东，被遗弃，桥梁被封锁。那条河已经被死人占领了，这是瘟疫的症状。城市的活岸被一道匆忙建造的墙包围着，用破碎的砖石和岸上的瓦砾、破碎的雕像和破碎的寺庙的柱子加固。",
	"Dirty tattered curtains hang in doorways, and the narrow winding streets and alleyways are braced by wooden posts that prop the dilapidated buildings from crumbing into disrepair. These beams are draped with ragged cloths, forming a shadowy canopy that casts the maze of Crixos' streets into a perpetual twilight.": "肮脏破烂的窗帘挂在门口，狭窄蜿蜒的街道和小巷由木柱支撑着，这些木柱支撑着破旧的建筑不至于溃烂。这些横梁上挂着破旧的布条，形成一个朦胧的天幕，将克雷索斯迷宫般的街道笼罩在永恒的暮色中。",
	"The Plague is a disease borne from the withered, dead land of Nys. Some believe it to be a curse placed with the Worm's dying breath. Others say his dark blood poisoned the very earth to its bones, killing Nys before seeping across the sea. The blight corrupts all it touches. Those who are afflicted with the pestilence suffer fever and weakness. Their necrotic flesh begins to rot, and festering sores open across their body as they decay. Those that succumb to the plague soon rise as undead, twisted shambling remnants of what they once were.": "瘟疫是一种来自涅斯的枯萎、死亡之地的疾病。有些人认为它是虫子临死前的一个诅咒。也有人说他的黑血将大地毒害到了骨子里，在渗入大海之前就杀死了奈斯。瘟疫腐蚀了它所接触的一切。那些被瘟疫折磨的人，会发烧和虚弱。他们坏死的肉体开始腐烂，随着他们的腐烂，溃烂的疮口在他们身上打开。那些屈服于瘟疫的人很快就会变成不死之身，成为他们曾经的扭曲的残余物。",
	"The temple of Crixys rests on the city's western shore, a leaden dome held by faceless caryatids standing as silent sentinels to the river's dark waters. Once a holy site for pilgrims from all across Arkadia, now it stands as one of the city's few sanctuaries against the dead.": "克雷斯神庙坐落在城市的西岸，一个铅制的圆顶由无脸的卡里亚特人支撑着，作为沉默的哨兵站在河的黑暗水域。它曾经是整个阿卡迪亚朝圣者的圣地，现在则是该市为数不多的对抗死亡的圣地之一。",
	"Wrapped in bandages like lepers, the afflicted come to seek the aid of the priests and their silent god. Once the temple held a sacred spring whose waters, it was said, could cure any wound. Now the spring stands stagnant and polluted among the dying and the dead.": "像麻风病人一样裹着绷带，受折磨的人来到这里寻求祭司和他们沉默的神的帮助。寺庙里曾经有一个神圣的泉水，据说其水可以治愈任何伤口。现在，泉水停滞不前，在垂死的人和死人中被污染。",
	"Beneath the temple of Crixys is a sprawling labyrinth of ancient catacombs. Vast and deep, the crumbling tunnels of this necropolis stretch out perhaps larger than the very city. Some Arkadians believe these tunnels are the entrance to the underworld itself.": "在克雷斯神庙的下面是一个庞大的古代地下墓穴迷宫。巨大而深邃，这个墓地的破败的隧道延伸出来，也许比城市还要大。一些阿卡德人相信这些隧道是通往阴间的入口。",
	"What little order remains in the city is thanks to the Priests of Crixys. His priests, faces hidden behind leaden masks, toil to stave off the tide of rotting flesh. They tend the afflicted and ensure they do not rise. They place lead coins on the eyes of corpses and consign them to the pyre. Such is the custom in all Arkadia, but here it is done with dire purpose, lest the dead rise.": "城市里仅存的一点秩序要归功于克雷斯的祭司们。他的祭司们把脸藏在铅质面具后面，努力抵御腐烂的肉体之潮。他们照顾受折磨的人，并确保他们不会复活。他们把铅币放在尸体的眼睛上，把它们送进火堆。这是所有阿卡迪亚地区的习俗，但在这里，这样做是有可怕的目的，以免死者复活。",
	"Arkadians believe that once they die, if given the proper burial rites, their shade will be taken by Crixys. He will ferry them across the river into Lycium, the golden fields at the heart of the underworld. They also believe that the curse of undeath tethers the spirit to the mortal world and it may not rest until the risen is likewise put to rest. Some shades, denied proper funeral rites, return as apparitions, haunting spectres whose unrest calls them back.": "阿卡德人相信，一旦他们死亡，如果得到适当的埋葬仪式，他们的阴魂会被克雷斯带走。他将把他们渡过河，进入利卡西，即冥界中心的黄金地带。他们还相信，未死的诅咒将精神束缚在凡间，除非复活的人同样得到安息，否则它可能不会休息。有些阴魂被剥夺了适当的葬礼仪式，就会以幽灵的形式回来，这些不安的幽灵会召唤他们回来。",
	"Crixos is also home to many thieves and outlaws. With no king or army to enforce the rule of law, they come seeking refuge from the pursuit of Consuls of Hyperium or the reach of a slighted Illyrian aristocrat. They see the dead not as problem, but an opportunity. Some venture into the abandoned eastern bank to loot scavanage that which has not already succumbed to the blight, even stripping the lead from the domes of temple roofs to cast into bronze or coins.": "克里索斯也是许多盗贼和亡命之徒的家园。由于没有国王或军队来执行法治，他们来寻求庇护，以逃避希佩里姆执政官的追捕或被轻视的伊利安贵族的影响。他们认为死者不是问题，而是一个机会。有些人冒险进入被遗弃的东岸，掠夺那些尚未屈服于瘟疫的东西，甚至从寺庙屋顶的圆顶上剥下铅，铸成青铜或硬币。",
	"Smuggler's ships sail up the brackish river, pushing past the floating bodies of pale bloated fish, to Crixos bringing supplies to the pestilent city to be sold at exorbitant fees. When they depart, the hulls of their ships carry a more sinister cargo, mummified corpses of the dead, stolen from the temples and catacombs. They are embalmed and wrapped with dirty cloth so they do not rise. Some say they sell to the School of Hekamn, other say they sell them to Nys.": "走私者的船只沿着咸水河航行，推过漂浮的苍白臃肿的鱼的尸体，前往克雷斯，把物资带到瘟疫之城，以高昂的费用出售。当他们离开时，他们的船体携带着更邪恶的货物，即从神庙和地下墓穴偷来的木乃伊化的死者尸体。他们经过防腐处理，用脏布包裹着，所以他们不会上升。有人说他们卖给了海卡姆学校，也有人说他们卖给了奈斯。",
	"Crixos holds the largest philosopher's school outside Ithea. The School of Hekamn is devoted to the studies of necromancy, alchemy, medicine, and the secrets of the Nyssian drow.": "克里索斯拥有伊泰亚之外最大的哲学家学校。海卡门学校致力于研究死灵法术、炼金术、医学和尼西亚乌鸦的秘密。",
	"Exiled drow teach the philosophers secrets spirited from their lost home. Much of this knowledge has been recorded in the school's library, a collection of esoteric scrolls, tablets, and artifacts, many plundered by tomb robbers in Nys.": "被放逐的乌鸦向哲学家们传授从他们失落的家园传来的秘密。这些知识大部分都被记录在学校的图书馆里，这些图书馆收集了很多神秘的卷轴、石板和文物，其中有很多是在奈斯被盗墓者掠走的。",
	"The philosophers and the drow have an uneasy peace with the Priests of Crixys. The school's obsession with necromancy, death, and the secrets of Nys have afforded them a dark reputation. However unhealthy their interest in the dead, they help to combat the plague by herding the undead and creating elixirs and other alchemical ichors that can stave off its effects.": "哲学家和乌鸦与Crixys的牧师们有着不稳定的和平。这所学校对死灵法术、死亡和奈斯的秘密的痴迷使他们获得了黑暗的声誉。然而，他们对死人的兴趣并不健康，他们通过驱赶亡灵，制造灵药和其他可以抵御瘟疫影响的炼金术ichors，帮助对抗瘟疫。",
	"Crixos lies in the OreyanWood, a dark and ancientforest, the largest in all Arkadia. The blight spreading from the south has poisoned the very land itself. Dead shamble through the dark twilight beneath the branches of sickly trees. Small villages lay abandoned, their inhabitants long fled or taken by the plague. The fae of the wood, ancient as its trees, have also fallen prey to the plague's corruption, driven to madness and starvation.": "Crixos位于OreyanWood，一个黑暗而古老的森林，是整个阿卡迪亚最大的森林。从南方蔓延而来的瘟疫已经毒害了这片土地本身。在黑暗的暮色中，死人在病态的树枝下蹒跚而行。小村庄被遗弃了，它们的居民早已逃离或被瘟疫带走。树林中的异种，和它的树木一样古老，也成为了瘟疫腐败的牺牲品，被驱赶到疯狂和饥饿之中。",
	"Illyria is a decadent city of wealth, beauty, and earthly pleasures. Old noble families vie for control over the city's riches and vast trade networks. It is an opulent city filled with marble statues, ornate fountains, and packed market squares. To the rich, it is a place of lavish gardens, indulgence, and entertainment. Outside the city, vineyards and fields of olive trees cover the green villa-dotted hills. The city owes its abundant wealth to its natural port, fed by trade with each of the cities of Arkadia as well as Psysseria beyond.": "伊利里亚是一个充满财富、美丽和世俗快乐的颓废城市。古老的贵族家族争相控制着城市的财富和庞大的贸易网络。这是一座富丽堂皇的城市，到处是大理石雕像、华丽的喷泉和拥挤的市场广场。对富人来说，这是一个充满奢华花园、放纵和娱乐的地方。在城外，葡萄园和橄榄树田覆盖着绿色别墅点缀的山丘。这个城市的丰富财富归功于它的天然港口，它与阿卡迪亚的每一个城市以及普西利亚的贸易都有联系。",
	"Illyria is famed for its culture and beauty. Every brassdomed building and arched colonnade is a monument to its prosperity. Every hill, it seems, is crowned with a palace, home to a noble or wealthy merchant. Aqueducts carry water throughout the city, giving rise to luxurious pleasure gardens. Steaming baths are fed by water from natural hot springs beneath the city.": "伊利里亚以其文化和美丽而闻名。每座铜墙铁壁的建筑和拱形柱廊都是其繁荣的纪念碑。似乎每座山都有一座宫殿，是贵族或富商的家。引水渠将水输送到整个城市，产生了豪华的娱乐花园。热气腾腾的浴池由城市地下的天然温泉水提供。",
	"All manner of entertainment can be found within the city's marble walls. Poets and thespians fill the city, performing in market squares, agora, and amphitheatres, wearing the terracotta faces of comedy or tragedy. Perhaps more famed than the city's theatres are its brothels, from dingy rooms by the port to the lavish pleasure gardens atop the hills.": "在这座城市的大理石墙内可以找到各种形式的娱乐活动。诗人和戏剧家充斥着整个城市，在集市广场、广场和圆形剧场表演，戴着喜剧或悲剧的赤土脸。也许比城市的剧院更出名的是它的妓院，从港口边的肮脏房间到山顶上的奢华的娱乐花园。",
	"The great Coliseum of Illyria is second only to that of Kryta in its size, and surpasses it in the exotic nature of its games. Their special shows draw roaring crowds, pitting mortals against a menagerie of beasts: giant serpents from Psysseria, captured manticore, or minotaurs strapped with plates of spiked bronze armor. Creatures from every corner of the earth clash with warriors from all across Arkadia, competing for the city's fleeting currencies: gold, fame, and power. Crowd favorites ascend showered in gold and all the mortal pleasures it can buy. By the port, fighting pits cater to those not sated by blood spilled on the sands of decadent arenas. Often aspiring warriors come to the city in the hopes of winning fame, only to end up fighting for scraps in the pits.": "伊利里亚的大竞技场在规模上仅次于克里塔的竞技场，但在游戏的异国性质上却超过了克里塔。他们的特别表演吸引了大量的观众，让凡人与各种野兽对决：来自普西利亚的巨蛇、被捕获的尾兽，或者绑着带刺青铜盔甲的牛头人。来自地球各个角落的生物与来自阿卡迪亚各地的战士发生冲突，争夺城市中转瞬即逝的货币：黄金、名声和权力。人群中的宠儿们在金子和所有能买到的凡人的快乐中升天。在港口边上，斗兽场满足了那些没有在颓废的竞技场的沙地上洒下鲜血的人的需求。很多有抱负的战士来到这个城市，希望赢得名声，但最终却在斗兽场中为残羹剩饭而战。",
	"The Agora is the great market square heart of Illyria—a grand plaza packed with crying merchants from every corner of the land. Field dwarves sell clay amphora of wine and olive oil from the vineyards outside the city walls, while their mountain brothers sell the finest bronze swords and heavy jewelry of gold and thick glass. Itheans resupplying their ships stop to haggle over old scrolls and ancient fragments of stone tablets, while Psysserian merchants trade spices and fine silks from their distant exotic land.": "亚戈拉是伊利里亚的大市场广场中心--一个盛大的广场，挤满了来自这片土地各个角落的哭泣的商人。田地里的矮人出售来自城墙外葡萄园的葡萄酒和橄榄油的泥罐，而他们的山地兄弟则出售最好的青铜剑以及黄金和厚玻璃的沉重珠宝。补给船的伊瑟人停下脚步，为古老的卷轴和古老的石板碎片讨价还价，而赛瑟商人则从遥远的异国土地上交易香料和精美的丝绸。",
	"Fenced by arched pillars, the wide square's colorful mosaic tiles have been worn smooth by the endless tide of the crowds. At its center stands a gilded statue of Lyria, surrounded by nymphs, satyrs, and siren. On holy days, the fountain flows with wine. The fountain, like much of the city's ornate stonework, was carved by the field dwarves, the first to settle this land.": "广场被拱形的柱子围着，宽阔的广场上五颜六色的马赛克瓷砖已经被无尽的人潮磨得光滑。广场中央矗立着一尊镀金的莱雅雕像，周围是仙女、萨提尔和海妖。在神圣的日子里，喷泉流淌着葡萄酒。这座喷泉，就像这座城市的许多华丽的石雕一样，是由最早在这片土地上定居的田野矮人雕刻的。",
	"The port of Illyria, set in a wide natural bay, harbors a hundred ships, their painted sails flying the colors of every civilization. Ships from Ithea, Kryta, Crixos, and even Psysseria, come to trade in this port, the gateway to all Arkadia. Long wooden docks extend from a gentle shore to berth ships of all sizes, from large triremes to small merchant vessels.": "伊利里亚港口坐落在一个宽阔的天然海湾中，停泊着上百艘船只，它们的船帆上挂着各种文明的颜色。来自Ithea、Kryta、Crixos，甚至Psysseria的船只都来这个港口交易，这里是通往整个阿卡迪亚的门户。长长的木制码头从平缓的海岸延伸出来，停泊着各种尺寸的船只，从大型三桅船到小型商船。",
	"Past the docks is the city's lower level, separated from its upper half by a cliff. A wide stone stair is cut into the cliff, its long even steps wide enough to march an army and gentle enough for carts. It is lined with bronze statues and braziers, lit at night. The area at the bottom of the steps is home to the city's poor merchants, beggars, peddlers, and mercenaries. It even has its own agora, called the low market. Here, cheap goods, often of circumspect origin, may be bought, sold, bartered, and stolen. It is filled with cheap brothels, underground fighting pits, and a ruined coliseum known as the Arena where the rules are loose and the stakes high.": "过了码头，就是城市的下层，与上层的一半被悬崖隔开。悬崖上开凿了一个宽大的石阶，其长长的均匀的台阶足以让军队行军，也足以让马车缓行。它的两旁是青铜雕像和火炉，在夜间点燃。阶梯底部的区域是城市中贫穷的商人、乞丐、小贩和雇佣兵的家。它甚至有自己的广场，称为低级市场。在这里，廉价的商品，往往是来源不明的，可以买卖、交换和偷窃。这里充满了廉价的妓院、地下格斗场和一个被称为 \"竞技场 \"的废旧竞技场，这里的规则很宽松，赌注很大。",
	"Outside the walls of the city lie fertile fields, vineyards of grapes and rows of olive trees. These are owned by Illyria's noble families. The hills around Illyria are dotted with villas, roofed in terracotta tiles. Notoriously corrupt and greedy, these aristocrats vie for power and control of the city.": "城墙外是肥沃的田地、葡萄种植园和成排的橄榄树。这些都是伊利里亚的贵族家庭所拥有的。伊利里亚周围的山丘上遍布别墅，屋顶是赤土瓦片。这些贵族的腐败和贪婪是出了名的，他们争夺权力和对城市的控制。",
	"House Alexares is the most wealthy and powerful of all the houses, though it is not strong enough on its own to oppose the other two. Made rich on taxes, the house controls the city's walls, gates, and roads.": "Alexares家族是所有家族中最富有和最强大的，尽管它本身并不强大，不足以对抗其他两个家族。该家族靠税收致富，控制着城市的城墙、城门和道路。",
	"House Thaddaeus, run almost to ruin through the gambling and reckless squandering of its heirs, makes its gold through many of the city's underground fighting arenas and less savory brothels. On the high roads, in the hills outside the city, many bandits owe debts to this house.": "泰达乌斯家族因其继承人的赌博和不计后果的挥霍而几乎破产，通过城市的许多地下格斗场和不太可口的妓院赚取黄金。在公路上，在城外的山上，许多强盗都欠着这个家族的债。",
	"House Gaiana has strong ties to Psysseria. They control much of the city's port, and grow rich off Psysserian gold, melted down and recast into Illyrian coins. No smugglers dock without paying their due bribes to this house.": "盖亚纳家族与普西利亚有着密切的联系。他们控制着这个城市的大部分港口，并依靠普西利亚的黄金发家致富，这些黄金被熔化后重新铸造成伊利安的硬币。如果不向这个家族支付应有的贿赂，就没有走私者靠岸。",
	"There are many smaller houses, all squabbling for power in the city. They always need mercenaries to protect ships and caravans, as well as those willing to carry out other, less public, tasks.": "有许多小家族，都在为城市的权力而争吵。他们总是需要雇佣兵来保护船只和商队，以及那些愿意执行其他不太公开的任务的人。",
	"Off the warm southern coast of Arkadia lie the Myriad Isles. This archipelago between Arkadia, Psysseria, and Nys is home to thousands of uncharted small islands. Few have been mapped, even by Ithean explorers. Many ships that sail into the islands never return, and others only after many years, bringing back tales of enchantresses and strange lands. Some sailors speak of a mighty hydra who lives in a boiling sea of sunken wrecks, where sirens flicker between the bones of sunken triremes and the glitter of lost gold.": "在阿卡迪亚温暖的南部海岸，坐落着妙音岛。这个位于阿卡迪亚、普西利亚和奈斯之间的群岛是成千上万个未知的小岛的家园。即使是伊泰安的探险家，也很少有人绘制过地图。许多驶入这些岛屿的船只从未返回，而其他船只则在多年后才返回，并带回了关于女巫和陌生土地的传说。一些水手说，有一只强大的九头蛇生活在沉船残骸的沸腾之海中，那里的海妖在沉没的三桅帆船的骨头和失落的黄金的闪耀之间闪烁。",
	"The isles are home to the Phoacian pirates, Psysserian humans who fled the lash of their serpent masters and turned to plundering Arkadian and Psysserian ships alike. The sails of their fast light ships are painted with the severed head of a gorgon, a dreaded sight that strikes fear in the heart of any merchant sailor.": "这座岛屿是腓亚基海盗的家园，他们是普西赛尔人，为了躲避他们的大蛇主人的鞭打，转而掠夺阿卡迪亚和普西赛尔的船只。他们快速轻盈的船帆上画着戈尔贡的断头，这是一个可怕的景象，让任何商船水手都感到恐惧。",
	"There are also tales of the lotus eaters—exiled Nyssian drow, cannibals who now worship Phaedrus, their dark skin painted with white lines of dried and cracked mud. They drink wine from human skulls, amid the buzzing of wasps and flies.": "还有关于食莲者的故事--被放逐的尼西亚乌鸦，现在崇拜费德鲁斯的食人者，他们的黑皮肤上涂有干裂的泥巴的白线。他们在黄蜂和苍蝇的嗡嗡声中，用人的头骨喝葡萄酒。",

	"A hydra is a coiling mass of writhing serpents, each head possessed of an ancient and malevolent cunning. They dwell deep in the dark places of Gargaros, making their lairs in the molten crevasses and colossal ruins of that broken, shattered land. It is said they are bound to that place beyond the mountains, just as their master, the Great Hydra, though their terrible influence extends the length and breadth of Arkadia.": "九头蛇是由蠕动的蛇组成的盘状物，每个头都拥有古老而邪恶的狡猾。它们居住在加尔加罗斯的黑暗之地，在那片破碎的土地上的熔岩裂缝和巨大的废墟中做它们的巢穴。据说它们被束缚在山外的那个地方，就像它们的主人大九头蛇一样，尽管它们可怕的影响力延伸到了阿卡迪亚的长度和宽度。",
	"Legend says the hydra were born in the Age of Gods, when Hyperius, father of Arkadia, broke the will of the Great Hydra and bound him beneath Gargaros, devastating the land. By his hand were sundered a score of the beast's hundred heads in their contest, and each fell to the broken earth and became hydra—extensions of his titanic will that fled Hyperius' might and burrowed into the dark, where they wait still, orchestrating their master's return.": "传说中，九头蛇诞生于诸神时代，当时阿卡迪亚的父亲希佩里乌斯打破了大九头蛇的意志，将其束缚在加尔加罗斯之下，破坏了这片土地。在他的手中，巨兽的一百个头颅在他们的竞争中被砍掉了几十个，每一个都落到了破碎的土地上，成为九头蛇--他巨大意志的延伸，逃离了希佩里乌斯的力量，钻进了黑暗中，他们仍然在那里等待，策划着他们主人的回归。",
	"Through cunning and promises of power have they bound hordes of Gargaros' children, the orcs, to their will over the many centuries, twisting their natural ferocity and pride into a ravenous hunger for blood and chaos. These Hydrak, as they call themselves, grow huge and monstrous through dark rituals taught them by their ancient masters, and sacrifice their weak to feed the endless hunger of the hydra. They make war with the other orc clans who defy the Hydra: the Cyclopax with their mighty one-eyed juggernauts, and the Cerberi who tame massive three-headed beasts as mounts and hunters. Amassed in bloodthirsty hordes, the Hydrak surge south in fierce raiding parties, besieging the gates of Erebos and the many dwarven and Hyperian keeps that bind them north.": "通过狡猾和权力的承诺，他们将成群结队的加尔加洛斯的孩子--兽人--束缚在他们的意志之下，在许多个世纪里，将他们天生的凶猛和骄傲扭曲成对血和混乱的饥渴。这些海德拉克，正如他们自己所称，通过古代主人教给他们的黑暗仪式而变得巨大和畸形，并牺牲他们的弱者来满足海德拉克无尽的饥饿感。他们与其他反抗九头蛇的兽人部族开战：拥有强大的独眼巨兽的Cyclopax，以及驯服巨大的三头兽作为坐骑和猎手的Cerberi。嗜血成群的海德拉族以凶猛的突击队向南涌去，围攻埃雷波斯的大门以及束缚他们向北的许多矮人和希伯来人堡垒。",

	"Immortal relics from the Age of Gods, bound by an eldritch connection to the titan himself, hydra know much of power that has been lost through the ages—though their echoing whispers are rarely to be believed, and always do they serve their own hidden purpose, even in the gifting of magics. Many of the mightiest Hydrak wield sorceries of fire and darkness granted by their masters, and tales, scarcely to be believed, tell of fallen philosophers and other twisted mortals seeking pacts with these creatures, walking unmolested through Gargaros' ash-choked expanse to fated meetings where they pledge themselves in service to the hydra and their father for similar secrets, returning to Arkadia to work the dark will of their new patron.": "九头蛇是众神时代的不朽遗物，被与泰坦本身的长生关系所束缚，它知道许多在时代中已经消失的力量--尽管它们回荡的低语很少被人相信，而且它们总是为自己的隐藏目的服务，甚至在魔法的馈赠方面。许多最强大的海德拉克挥舞着由他们的主人授予的火焰和黑暗的巫术，而几乎没有人相信的故事，讲述了堕落的哲学家和其他扭曲的凡人寻求与这些生物的契约，不受干扰地走过加尔加罗斯灰烬的广袤地带，来到命中注定的会议，在那里他们承诺为海德拉克和他们的父亲服务，以获得类似的秘密，回到阿卡迪亚，为他们新赞助人的黑暗意志服务。",
	"Though their ultimate goal is known only to them, the Hydra seek one thing above all: orichalcum. Their Hydrak roam far and wide, plundering the deep places of Gargaros for the precious golden metal, their slaves toiling with crude tools to dredge it up and deliver it to the deep hidden lairs of their masters, where they store it in vast caverns. However, like other monstrous spawn of the titans, the hydra cannot stand its touch themselves, the pure metal searing their flesh on contact. Thus orichalcum blades are prized by the bravest heroes, especially dwarves and other Arkadians seeking to best these monsters in service to Hyperius and Erebos, the hydra's eternal enemies.": "虽然他们的最终目标只有他们自己知道，但九头蛇追求的是一样东西：金银。他们的Hydrak游荡在很远很远的地方，在Gargaros的深处掠夺珍贵的金色金属，他们的奴隶用粗糙的工具劳作，把它挖出来，送到他们主人的深藏的巢穴，在那里他们把它储存在巨大的洞穴里。然而，就像泰坦巨人的其他怪胎一样，九头蛇自己也无法忍受它的触碰，纯金属一接触就会灼伤他们的肉体。因此，最勇敢的英雄们都很珍视金银财宝，尤其是矮人和其他阿卡德人，他们都想在为九头蛇的永恒敌人希佩里乌斯和埃瑞波斯服务的过程中战胜这些怪兽。",
	"The Charybdian is a creature of legend and of terror. The boldest Ithean sailors tell of long voyages among the broken, uncharted ruins of Scyllaea, now little more than fractured isles scattered beyond the blue horizon, and of the creature that lurks there beneath the tide—immense, intelligent, and hungry; always hungry. Few live who can claim to have peered into the great eye of the beast or seen its thrashing maw, a devourer of ships, and fewer still who are not raving madmen, pulled from wreckage with a wild glint in their eye, desperate to return to the isles and rejoin the voice below.": "Charybdian是一种传奇和恐怖的生物。最勇敢的伊泰安水手讲述了在破碎的、无人知晓的锡拉里亚废墟中的长期航行，现在这些废墟只不过是散落在蓝色地平线之外的断裂的小岛，以及潜伏在潮汐之下的生物--巨大的、聪明的、饥饿的；总是饥饿的。很少有人能声称自己曾窥视过这只巨兽的大眼睛，或看到它那张吞噬船只的大嘴，更少有人不是疯狂的疯子，他们从残骸中被拉出来，眼中闪烁着狂热的光芒，不顾一切地想回到小岛上，重新加入下面的声音。",
	"Scyllaean elves of the isles know it best, though they are loath to speak of it. They say it is an emissary of the Maw, the great titan that swallowed their home, plunging it and all its arcane wonders into the dark void beneath the sea. They say it can speak—not with words, but directly into one's mind—and knows the truth of a mortal's soul, which it uses to corrupt them to its own unknowable purpose.": "岛屿上的西莱亚精灵最了解它，尽管他们不愿意谈论它。他们说它是巨口的使者，那个吞噬了他们家园的伟大泰坦，把它和它所有的奥术奇迹都投入了海下的黑暗虚空。他们说它能说话--不是用语言，而是直接进入一个人的心灵--并且知道一个凡人灵魂的真相，它用它来腐蚀他们，达到自己不可知的目的。",
	"Its coming is heralded by the Black Tide, a deep shadow on the waves, as the void itself rising to the surface.

The most feared are the Kraken, ancient leviathans warped by the Charybdian and bound to its will, breakers of whole fleets and the bane of all Ithea.": "它的到来是由黑潮预示的，黑潮是海浪上的深层阴影，就像虚空本身上升到表面。所有的海洋生物都会逃离这股潮水，它可以将海中的野兽变成可怕的怪兽，跟随卡里布迪亚的脚步，听从它的命令。最令人畏惧的是克拉肯（Kraken），这些被卡里布迪恩扭曲并被其意志所束缚的古老利维坦，是整个舰队的破坏者和所有伊提亚的祸根。",
	"Few fear the tide as strongly as the siren, who claim they can hear the voice of the Maw on the tide like a maddening cry. Their sisters caught by the tide are warped into sea witches, powerful enchantresses who work the Maw's will. Siren hate the Maw and its servants, and fear this fate above all others.": "很少有人像海妖那样强烈地惧怕潮水，他们声称自己能在潮水中听到魔王的声音，就像一种令人疯狂的呼喊。她们的姐妹被潮水卷入，被扭曲成海巫师，成为强大的女巫，执行巨浪的意志。海妖憎恨大口和它的仆人，对这种命运的恐惧超过了其他一切。",
	"Around the Charybdian swarm its servants, the merrow, twisted mortals transformed into monsters of the sea by the Black Tide and bound to the Charybdian. Bound as one mind across the waters, theMerrow raid all the leagues of the sea for living victims to drag into the depths to join their ranks, or feed the endless hunger of the Charybdian and its master, who lurks at the edge of the world healing from the wound dealt it by Thessa. Scyllaean elves, the most gifted of the seers, claim it will one day heal from Thessa's brand and rise again to swallow all Arkadia.": "Charybdian周围聚集着它的仆人--Merrow，这些扭曲的凡人被黑潮变成了海中的怪物，并被捆绑在Charybdian上。在水面上被捆绑成一个思想，Merrow在所有的海域里搜寻活生生的受害者，把他们拖进深海，加入他们的队伍，或者满足Charybdian和它的主人无尽的饥饿感，后者潜伏在世界的边缘，从Thessa给它的伤口中愈合。Scyllaean精灵，最有天赋的预言家，声称它有一天会从忒萨的烙印中痊愈，并再次崛起，吞噬整个阿卡迪亚。",

For centuries its broken husk has whispered to the drow of the desert, teaching them forbidden secrets of life and death in exchange for their eternal service.": "黑法老是来自遥远的奈斯的地衣，奈斯是古代沙漠中的死亡王国，在海的另一边。他们被灌输了他们古老宗教的最高奥秘，是最阴险、最强大的虫族崇拜者，虫族是被克雷斯杀死的不死泰坦，活在沙漠下的尼斯神庙的地底。几个世纪以来，它残破的躯壳一直在对沙漠中的乌鸦说着悄悄话，教他们生与死的禁忌秘密，以换取他们永恒的服务。",
	"The Cult of the Worm works in secret in Crixos, spreading the plague of undeath, each victim feeding the ravenous shade of the titan. Tales are told of golden sarcophagi bearing the bodies of pharaohs smuggled across the sea in the holds of Crixian ships, their crew secret servants of the Cult. Nyssian exiles of Hekamh claim the pharaohs leave their phylacteries behind, canopic jars containing their hearts suspended in the ichor of the Worm, an alchemical secret only they understand.

	"Exposure to the sun is anathema in the Cult, so the pharaohs and their servants seek the underworld of Crixos, slipping into the vast catacombs of the forgotten necropolis that sprawls beneath the city and beyond.

	"The fallen denied Crixys' burial rites often return to Arkadia as shades, especially around the sacred city. Without Crixys' flame to guide them, they wander the world, silent, lost and alone, their despair often turning to rage and desperation, a broken fragment of who they were in life. Many are drawn to the River Cryx, and wander its banks.

With irresistible craft and beauty she beguiled mighty Krytos, fiercest of the gods, and by him gave birth to the gorgon, monstrous daughters twisted and cursed by the hubris of their mother. Enraged at her deception, Krytos drove her from Arkadia and sought to slay his accursed daughters.

Across the sea in Psysseria, where their mother reigns supreme over an enslaved empire of the broken, they receive tribute in temples strewn across the land as avatars of her glory, birthing hulking abominations and clever Phaedran in their image to be indoctrinated as zealots to her cause, the cruel and insidious instruments of her will to enslave all Arkadia and bend its people to their rightful queen.": "普西利亚的戈尔贡仍然为他们的母亲服务。她们是强大的女巫，令人着迷而又残忍，她们带领着成群结队的普赛亚凡人，在无尽的战争浪潮中渡海而来，用带毒的长矛和Khopesh的雷鸣般的声音来对抗警惕的Kryta的不屈阵线--他们父亲无情的军队，他们以被蔑视的女儿的愤怒来憎恨所有其他人。在大洋彼岸的Psysseria，他们的母亲在一个被奴役的破碎帝国中统治着，他们在散落在各地的寺庙中接受贡品，作为她荣耀的化身，以他们的形象孕育出巨大的憎恶和聪明的Phaedran，被灌输为她事业的狂热者，成为她意志的残酷和阴险的工具，以奴役整个Arkadia，使其人民屈服于他们合法的女王。",
	"Even those few gorgon who remain in Arkadia crave adoration, a longing that can never be sated. They surround themselves with the petrified statues of their prey, luring supplicants to their lairs deep in the wild hills and petrifying those they cannot bind through charm and sorcery, to wait on them eternally. Some who have calmed with the centuries start small communities in the wild of bound supplicants, seduced into their service, who live simply and worship the gorgon as their queen. Often, many gorgon Phaedran live among them in positions of honor, though their natural cruelty inevitably twists these seemingly idyllic villages into places of insidious suffering and mortal sacrifice.": "即使那些留在阿卡迪亚的少数戈尔贡也渴望崇拜，这是一种永远无法满足的渴望。他们用猎物的石化雕像围绕着自己，引诱祈求者到他们在野山深处的巢穴，把那些他们无法通过魅力和巫术捆绑的人石化，让他们永远地等待。一些随着时间的推移而平静下来的人在野外建立了由被捆绑的祈求者组成的小型社区，这些祈求者被引诱为他们的服务对象，他们生活简单，把高竿舞者当作他们的女王来崇拜。通常，许多戈尔贡-费德兰住在他们中间，地位尊贵，尽管他们天生残忍，不可避免地将这些看似田园诗般的村庄扭曲成阴险的痛苦和致命的牺牲之地。",
	"It is rumored that some powerful Illyrian houses have at their head a gorgon matriarch—a wayward Fae seeking refuge in the city of their cousins, drawing gorgon Phaedran to their service and working as spies and puppet masters behind the scenes.

	"The stone pillars of the great hall stared down at Bakis with the carved faces of the dwarven kings of Erebos, illuminated by the steady orange glow of the volcano's blood.

	"With slow deliberation, Bakis lowered the crucible, cracked and glowing as the lava itself, and poured the molten bronze. It spilled in a white-hot fall, flowing into the lines of the mold chiseled into the plinth before him. It was one of the oldest, carved from the very stone of the chamber. Slowly, the metal took its shape, the blazing, broad-leafed silhouette of a sword.": "巴基斯慢慢地斟酌着，放下了熔岩本身一样裂开和发光的坩埚，倒出了熔化的青铜。它以白热化的方式溢出，流进他面前的基座上凿出的模具的线条中。这是最古老的模具之一，由密室的石头雕刻而成。慢慢地，金属形成了它的形状，一个炽热的、宽叶的剑的轮廓。",
	"The dwarves say Erebos made them in his image. From carved stone and molten bronze he gave them life and into them poured the best of him, his enduring strength and skill.

	"It was there in that first fire that he forged the weapons of the gods for their great battle with the Titans for the heart of Arkadia. Beneath the sacred mountain, in shadow and the glow of bronze he toiled and made for the gods many wondrous things. For Krytos he made a spear that could never fail to strike and a shield to make him unbeatable in combat. For Thessa he made a trident, to hold within it all the secrets of the roiling sea. And to Hyperius he gave a chain of Orchalcum, unbreakable, and his greatest gift—a javelin of pure lightning that held within its crackling form all the power of the heavens' wrath.": "就是在那第一把火中，他为诸神与泰坦争夺阿卡迪亚的心脏而铸造了武器。在圣山之下，在阴影和青铜的光芒中，他辛勤工作，为众神制造了许多奇妙的东西。他为克里托斯制造了一把永远不会失手的长矛和一面盾牌，使他在战斗中立于不败之地。他为忒萨制造了一个三叉戟，里面装着大海的所有秘密。他还为希佩里乌斯制作了一条牢不可破的乌金链，以及他最伟大的礼物--纯正的闪电标枪，它的噼啪声中蕴含着上天愤怒的所有力量。",
	"Dwarves have strong, prominent features. Field dwarves have skin tanned and weathered by many years of sun and soil in the fields. Volcano dwarves have a slightly lighter complexion due to their lives spend toiling under the mountains. While field dwarves tend to dress simply, volcano dwarves take deep pride in their appearance. Their hair and beards, black or reddish brown, is worn in matted locks. They cap these coils in heavy beads of gold, bronze, or mountain glass. They trade with humans for royal colors of cloth and adorn themselves with thick rings and armbands, set with wide stones.": "矮人有强壮、突出的特征。田野矮人的皮肤被晒得黝黑，并在田间多年的阳光和土壤中风化。火山矮人的肤色略浅，因为他们的生活是在山下劳作。田野上的矮人往往穿着简单，而火山矮人则对自己的外表深感自豪。他们的头发和胡须是黑色或红棕色的，被打成一绺一绺的。他们用金、铜或山地玻璃制成的沉重的珠子为这些线圈戴上帽子。他们与人类交换皇家颜色的布匹，用厚厚的戒指和臂章装饰自己，上面镶嵌着宽大的宝石。",
	"The dwarves of Erebos say that in the beginning, all the dwarves called the mountains home. As some toiled at the mountains base, Phaedrus lured them away from their work with wine, and a bountiful feast. It is said those dwarves never returned to their mountain home, but followed Phaedrus into the hills and fields, and thus as the field dwarves they became known.": "埃里伯斯的矮人说，一开始，所有的矮人都以山为家。当一些人在山脚下劳作时，费德鲁斯用酒和丰盛的宴席引诱他们离开他们的工作。据说这些矮人再也没有回到山里的家，而是跟着费德鲁斯来到山里和田野，因此他们被称为田野矮人。",

The field dwarves, in turn, think their kin in the volcanoes are too secretive and serious.": "火山矮人对他们在田地里的表兄弟不怎么看重。他们认为埃里伯斯创造矮人是为了让他们成为工人，而将田野矮人视为懒惰和不熟练。而田野矮人则认为他们在火山中的亲属过于神秘和严肃。",

	"Mount Erebos, or Kor Erebos in the dwarven tongue, is the most sacred site of their people. The fires of its great forge are fed from the blood of the mountain and its flames have never died. The elders, smith-priests of Erebos, tend the fire and forge the weapons of kings and heroes. Ancient channels are carved in the stones of the floor for molten bronze to flow. Some of these molds are said to have been used to forge the legendary weapons of the gods. It is one of the few places where orichalcum can be worked. This rare golden-bronze metal, sacred to Eberos, is found only in Gargaros, drawn from the fiery peaks of that broken land. Many horrible monstrosities bound to the Titans are seared by its golden touch, making its weapons prized by the bravest of Arkadia's heroes. Weapons and armor that are wrought from it are more precious than gold, though they can never be sold, only given.": "埃里伯斯山，在矮人的语言中叫Kor Erebos，是他们民族最神圣的地方。它的大锻造炉的火是由山的血液提供的，它的火焰从未熄灭过。长老们，也就是埃瑞波斯的铁匠牧师们，照看着炉火，锻造着国王和英雄们的武器。地面的石头上刻着古老的通道，供熔化的青铜流淌。其中一些模具据说曾被用来锻造传说中的诸神的武器。这里是为数不多的可以加工 orichalcum 的地方之一。这种罕见的金青铜金属，对埃贝罗斯来说是神圣的，只在加尔加罗斯发现，从那片破碎的土地的火热山峰中提取。许多被泰坦束缚的可怕怪物都被它的金色触感所灼伤，使得它的武器被阿卡迪亚最勇敢的英雄们所珍视。用它锻造的武器和盔甲比黄金还要珍贵，尽管它们永远不能被出售，只能被赠送。",
	"Though the dwarves call the volcanic mountains of Kor Erebos and its foothills their home, they can be found throughout Arkadia, lighting forges in each of the great cities. They consider themselves Arkadians, in their blood, as much as the race of men and share with them a deep hatred of the orcs of Gargaros. Their masterful crafts are highly valued and sought after. They make crystal glass and beaten lead funeral masks in Crixos; jewelry in Corinth; and rams, nails, and all the tools needed to furnish Ithean ships. Their most common work, however, is found in Kryta and Hyperium, where the bronze of their swords and spears and armor is prized above all others.": "虽然矮人把Kor Erebos及其山麓的火山称为他们的家，但他们在整个阿卡迪亚都能找到，在每个大城市点燃锻造。他们认为自己是阿卡迪亚人，在他们的血液中，就像人的种族一样，并与他们一样对加加罗斯的兽人怀有深深的仇恨。他们高超的手艺受到高度重视和追捧。他们在克雷斯制造水晶玻璃和打制的铅制葬礼面具；在科林斯制造珠宝；还有公羊、钉子，以及为伊泰安船只提供的所有工具。然而，他们最常见的工作是在克里塔和希佩里姆，在那里，他们的剑和长矛以及盔甲的青铜制品比其他任何东西都要珍贵。",

	"Half orcs are common in Arkadia. In Kryta, where strength and ferocity are prized, many orcs have some human blood in their veins. In Illyria, they are desired for their size and striking appearance.

Half orcs in Arkadia use the same game statistics as the orcs in this section.": "半兽人在阿卡迪亚很常见。在克里塔，力量和凶猛受到推崇，许多兽人的血管里都有一些人类的血统。在伊利里亚，他们因其体型和引人注目的外表而受到欢迎。然而，在希佩里姆，他们受到蔑视，因为这个地区的许多半兽人都是与加加罗斯的掠夺性兽人不断冲突的痛苦回忆。阿卡迪亚的半兽人使用与本节中兽人相同的游戏统计数据。",
	"Kassandra blew idle notes on her pan pipes as she reclined, hooved legs crossed on the dry grass, back against the gnarled trunk of an ancient cypress that afforded her dappled shade from the heat of the Arkadian summer sun. Her stick, lyre, and a terracotta jug—the sole survivor of last night's revelry—lay propped against the weathered bark. Out from the hill stretched fields of olive trees and trellised grapes, out to a villa's pillared walls and tiled roof, and beyond, the glint of the blue sea.": "卡桑德拉一边用她的盘管吹着空闲的音符，一边用蹄子交叉着躺在干燥的草地上，背靠着一棵古老的柏树的参天树干，这棵柏树为她提供了斑驳的阴凉，使她免受阿卡迪亚夏季太阳的炙烤。她的棍子、琴和一个陶罐--昨晚狂欢的唯一幸存者--靠在风化的树皮上。从山上向外延伸着橄榄树和大棚葡萄田，向外延伸到别墅的柱墙和瓦顶，再向外延伸到蓝色大海的闪光。",

	"Phaedran are the rare hybrid descendants of Arkadian fae. Sometimes, such children are born without warning to a pair of mortal parents, seemingly a gift—or curse—from the gods. Other such children are the direct result of a mortal mingling with a fae. Some Phaedran claim to be born of Phaedrus themself.": "斐德兰是阿卡德异种罕见的混血后裔。有时，这样的孩子毫无征兆地出生在一对凡人父母身上，似乎是来自神灵的礼物或诅咒。其他这样的孩子是凡人与异种交配的直接结果。有些斐德兰人声称自己是斐德鲁斯本人所生。",

	"Many Phaedran, restless in the great cities, take to the roads and wilds and small villages, never staying in one place for long as their youth stretches on for almost a century.

As such, many flock to Illyria, the wild and beautiful land of their patron god, but nowhere in Arkadia will you meet a common Phaedran. Touched by fate, they are almost always exceptional individuals, destined for heroism or tragedy.": "许多斐德兰人在大城市中感到不安，他们走上了道路、荒野和小村庄，从不在一个地方久留，因为他们的青春已经延续了近一个世纪。一部分是人类，一部分是异种，他们在两个世界都是陌生人，在两个世界都有自己的脚，在两个世界都没有家。因此，许多人涌向伊利里亚，他们的守护神的狂野和美丽的土地，但在阿卡迪亚的任何地方，你都不会遇到一个普通的费德兰。在命运的感召下，他们几乎都是特殊的个体，注定要成为英雄或悲剧。",
	"Though they are perhaps the most numerous of their kind, gorgon Phaedran predominantly live in the hostile, enthralled foreign land of Psysseria, comprising its highest mortal caste, second only to their gorgon masters. As they come from her ancestral enemy across the sea, gorgon Phaedran are met with fear and suspicion in Arkadia. They are seen as spies or assassins, and many are cold or even openly hostile towards them. Too often do they give cause to these suspicions, though not all gorgon Phaedran serve the titan. Some have fled their oppressors, braving foreign seas and war torn lands to start anew in Arkadia. Others are genuinely born to free gorgons who dwell in the Arkadian wilds and have never known the serpent's lash.": "虽然他们可能是同类中最多的，但高竿Phaedran主要生活在Psysseria这个充满敌意、令人着迷的异国土地上，包括其最高的凡人种姓，仅次于其高竿主人。由于他们来自大海对面的祖先的敌人，戈尔贡-菲德兰在阿卡迪亚受到了恐惧和怀疑。他们被看作是间谍或刺客，许多人对他们很冷淡，甚至公开表示敌意。虽然不是所有的戈尔贡-费德兰都为泰坦服务，但他们经常引起这些怀疑。有些人已经逃离了他们的压迫者，冒着异国的海洋和被战争蹂躏的土地，在阿卡迪亚重新开始。还有一些是真正的自由戈尔贡人所生，他们居住在阿卡迪亚的荒野上，从未见过大蛇的鞭打。",

Some say the bards of Illyria learned their craft from the satyr, and their beautiful music stirs the blood of all who hear it.": "萨提尔和他们的姐妹们被称为法恩，是最友好和最不危险的异种，是生命、爱情和音乐的爱好者。他们在伊利里亚周围的山丘上很常见，在那里他们与山丘上的矮人保持着密切的亲属关系，种植葡萄并酿造葡萄酒，这是这片土地上最浓郁、最甜美的葡萄酒，每晚都会召集所有人在星空下进行狂欢。有人说，伊利里亚的吟游诗人从萨提尔那里学到了他们的手艺，他们美妙的音乐激起了所有听到的人的血液。",
	"Siren are the most beautiful of the Fae, their unearthly voices carrying across the waves. Vain and playful, they decorate themselves with shells and pearls from the ocean floor, and love beautiful gifts—though their sense of what is beautiful can be unpredictable, and they are easily slighted and roused to wrath, disappearing below the waves with an angry splash. They are commonly a hazard, eager to be admired as they sun their shimmering skin on rocks along the coast, their hypnotic songs and stunning beauty drawing distracted sailors to ruin. Siren often struggle to understand this, thinking it is a game, and are wont to forget that most mortals cannot breathe water, sometimes dragging new friends to their deaths in the excitement.": "海妖是最美丽的异种，她们不食人间烟火的声音在海面上回荡。虚荣心和贪玩，她们用海底的贝壳和珍珠装饰自己，喜欢美丽的礼物--尽管她们对什么是美丽的感觉可能是不可预测的，而且她们很容易被轻视并被激怒，随着愤怒的水花消失在海浪之下。它们通常是一种危险，当它们在海岸边的岩石上晒出闪闪发光的皮肤时，渴望被人欣赏，它们催眠的歌声和惊人的美貌吸引着分心的水手们去破坏。海妖往往难以理解这一点，认为这是一个游戏，并经常忘记大多数凡人不能呼吸水，有时会在兴奋中把新朋友拖向死亡。",
	"Centaur hunt the wilds of Arkadia. They are proud and solitary, living for the thrill of the hunt, always seeking worthy prey. Centaur are particularly common in Oreya'sWood, and treat the elves with grudging respect, though outsiders are considered fair game and they will often set traps for them. Centaurs honor cunning and strength, and consider those too slow or too weak to escape them contemptible. They will sometimes parley with mortals, but only after those mortals prove themselves and earn the Fae's respect.": "半人马在阿卡迪亚的荒野上狩猎。他们骄傲而孤独，为狩猎的快感而活，总是在寻找有价值的猎物。半人马在奥瑞亚森林（Oreya'sWood）特别常见，他们对精灵充满敬意，尽管外来者被认为是公平的游戏，他们经常为他们设置陷阱。半人马崇尚狡猾和力量，认为那些太慢或太弱而无法逃脱他们的人是可鄙的。他们有时会与凡人谈判，但只有在那些凡人证明自己并赢得异种的尊重之后。",
	"Harpy are ill-tempered scavengers, circling the skies above barren hills and trade roads, watching and waiting. They are oft considered a bad omen, as they are drawn to calamity. Where harpies go, disaster often follows, and they are ever eager to swoop down and scavenge what they can from the wreckage. Rarely solitary, they typically travel in small groups called covens, and make their nests in cliff faces decorated with bones, jewelry, shredded cloth, and other 'treasures' they reclaim from the dead.": "哈比是脾气不好的食腐动物，在荒山和贸易道路的上空盘旋，观察和等待。它们经常被认为是一个坏兆头，因为它们被灾难所吸引。鹞子走到哪里，灾难就跟到哪里，它们总是渴望俯冲下来，从残骸中搜刮它们所能搜刮的东西。它们很少单独行动，通常是以小团体的形式旅行，称为 \"covens\"，并在悬崖峭壁上筑巢，用骨头、珠宝、碎布和其他从死者身上回收的 \"宝物 \"装饰。",

As such, they can be excellent sources of information, but they never surrender that knowledge without a price. Sphynx hide themselves away in grand ruins and sprawling cavern complexes, using their innate powers of illusion to fill their lairs with the lost splendors of Nys, where once they ruled as gods among the drow. They appear to rest in lavish palaces, a facade that masks piled bones. Sphynx respect intelligence above all, and always test the cleverness of those they encounter before offering aid or information.
