	"There may come a time when a character wants to harvest a creature for a material not listed in their harvesting table. Often this is due to them wanting some sort of trophy or keepsake from their kill. Due to the sheer scale of possible harvesting choices, it is impossible for this book to list every single body part that a character could theoretically harvest. Instead, you may use the following table for a general rule in deciding the DC for materials in a creature's body that are not included in their harvesting table. The DM is free to decide which of the following materials can be harvested from which creature, and if any special circumstances are present in that creature's anatomy that would change a material's DC.": "可能会有这样的时候，一个角色想要收获一个生物，以获得他们的收获表中没有列出的材料。这通常是由于他们想从他们的杀戮中获得某种战利品或纪念品。由于可能的收获选择规模巨大，本书不可能列出一个角色理论上可以收获的每一个身体部位。取而代之的是，你可以使用下表作为决定生物体内未包括在其收获表中的材料的DC的一般规则。DM可以自由决定以下哪些材料可以从哪个生物身上收获，以及该生物的解剖结构中是否有任何特殊情况会改变某种材料的DC。",

	"Welcome dear reader to Hamund's Harvesting Handbook Volume 3, written by your favorite harvesting mentor: Hamund Holderhek!": "欢迎亲爱的读者阅读《哈蒙德收获手册》第三卷，该书由您最喜爱的收获导师撰写。Hamund Holderhek!",
	"I do apologise for my prolonged absence and the delay in producing this entry in the Harvesting Handbook series. Unfortunately, several events befell me recently that prevented me from finishing this book in a timely manner. These events include, but are not limited to: abduction by the Demon Lords of the Abyss, foiling a Shadowfell incursion, going undercover into duergar society, investigating a spree of curious star spawn appearances, and a rather eventful tea time with a close acquaintance.": "我为自己长期缺席并推迟编写《收获手册》系列的这一作品表示歉意。不幸的是，最近发生了几件事情，使我无法及时完成这本书。这些事件包括，但不限于：被深渊恶魔领主绑架，挫败了暗影城的入侵，卧底杜尔加社会，调查了一连串奇怪的星体产卵的出现，以及与一位亲密的熟人度过了一段相当多事的茶时间。",
	"But the important thing is that the book is here now, and I must say that it is some of my finest work. Not only have I covered the gamut of newly discovered creatures to harvest, but my travels have brought me into contact with ancient artefacts, more people that need harvesting help, and several new schools of combat and magic that incorporate our venerable art into their practices.": "但重要的是，这本书现在就在这里，而且我必须说，这是我最好的作品。我不仅涵盖了新发现的可收获的生物的范围，而且我的旅行使我接触到了古老的文物，更多的人需要收获的帮助，还有几个新的战斗和魔法流派，将我们古老的艺术融入他们的实践。",
	"I implore you to enjoy this labor of love, dear reader. The knowledge in this book has been compiled under very trying circumstances, but it is all worth it in the pursuit of furthering our beloved craft. Inside, you will learn how to strip a skulk, melt down a marut, and hollow out a howler! Learn how to craft the spoils of your hunts into powerful weapons, channel the power of fiend lords into artefacts, and even find how to incorporate harvesting into every aspect of your being. Ours is an ever-expanding field, and I am so incredibly grateful to be with you every step of the way.": "亲爱的读者，我恳请你享受这项爱的劳动。本书中的知识是在非常艰难的情况下汇编而成的，但为了追求我们心爱的工艺，这一切都是值得的。在这本书里，你将学会如何剥掉一个skulk，融化一个marut，以及掏出一个howler! 学习如何将狩猎的战利品制作成强大的武器，将恶魔领主的力量转化为人工制品，甚至找到如何将收获融入你的各个方面。我们的领域是一个不断扩大的领域，我非常感激能与你一起走过每一步。",
	"Good luck and good harvesting,": "祝你好运，收获愉快。",
	"P.S. Some of you may be wondering where I will go from here, considering the discovery of new monsters seems to have dried up recently. Well, without getting too far into it, I will mention that I have become very interested in {@loader herbalism|collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Herbalism Handbook.json} as of late...": "P.S. 你们中的一些人可能想知道，考虑到最近发现的新怪物似乎已经枯竭，我将从这里出发。好吧，在不深入了解的情况下，我想说的是，最近我对（%0%）非常感兴趣......",

	"Thank you for purchasing the third instalment of the \"Hamund's Harvesting Handbook\" series. This volume covers the monsters included in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}, and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each monster, as well as over 130 new magical items to craft. The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but this book once again adds several new harvesting related rules to incorporate into your game. Premiering in this book is artifact crafting, a new harvesting related subclass for all 12 original player classes, and instructions for incorporating artificers into these harvesting rules. Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at {@i driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com} or hit me up on Twitter {@link @drifterworkshop|https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop} to discuss anything in this guide.": "感谢您购买《哈姆德的收获手册》系列的第三部。本卷涵盖了{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}中包含的怪物，和以前一样，每个怪物都有完整的收获清单，以及130多个新的魔法物品制作。收获和制作的规则没有改变，但本书再次增加了几个新的收获相关规则，以纳入你的游戏。本书中首次出现的是神器制作，所有12个原始玩家等级的新收获相关子类，以及将工匠纳入这些收获规则的说明。所有的东西都是以平衡为前提的，当然你也可以根据你自己的桌子来重新平衡本指南中的任何东西，或者随时给我留言（%%1%）或在Twitter上给我留言（%%2%）来讨论本指南中的任何东西。",
	"The act of removing useful body parts from a creature is referred to as {@b harvesting}. Anything that can be harvested from a creature is referred to as a {@b harvesting material} or simply {@b material}. In general, only creatures that have died may be harvested, but there may be some exceptions based on context.": "从一个生物身上切除有用的身体部分的行为被称为（%0%）。任何可以从一个生物身上收获的东西都被称为{@b harvesting material}或简单的{@b material}。一般来说，只有已经死亡的生物可以被收割，但根据情况可能有一些例外。",
	"This section details the steps and checks associated with actually performing a harvest, as well as explaining how to understand the information presented in the rest of the book. This information is designed to be simple and easily added to any campaign.": "本节详细介绍了与实际执行收获有关的步骤和检查，并解释了如何理解本书其他部分所介绍的信息。这些信息设计得很简单，很容易加入到任何活动中。",
	"Despite all the critics that try to call us mere scavengers, harvesting creatures is a truly cerebral art. It takes a keen mind to size up one's prize, and it can make all the difference between getting a valuable new trophy, or a poorly butchered piece of meat.": "尽管有评论家试图称我们只是拾荒者，但收获生物是一种真正的脑力艺术。它需要一个敏锐的头脑来衡量一个人的奖品，它可以使一个有价值的新战利品或一块可怜的肉之间的所有区别。",
	"Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt, they may instead choose to take a moment first and {@b appraise} the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested and then roll an Intelligence check, adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to that creature (see table below). For example, when appraising an {@creature allip|MTF} (which is an undead), the check would be an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, while appraising a {@creature cadaver collector|MTF} (which is a construct) would require an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check.": "在玩家开始砍伐和屠宰他们的猎物之前，他们可以选择先花点时间和{@b appraise}要收获的生物。要做到这一点，他们必须花1分钟时间检查要收获的生物，然后掷出智力检查，如果他们精通与该生物相对应的技能，则加上他们的熟练度奖励（见下表）。例如，当鉴定一个(1%)（亡灵）时，检查是智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查，而鉴定一个{@creature cadaver collector|MTF}（构造物）则需要智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查。",
	"The DC of the check is equal to {@b 8 + the Harvested Creature's CR} (treating any CR less than 1 as 0). Success on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement to harvest those materials, any special requirements to harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only attempt one appraisal check per creature.": "检查的DC等于{@b 8 + the Harvested Creature's CR}（将任何小于1的CR视为0）。该检查的成功使玩家完全了解该生物上任何有用的收获材料，收获这些材料的DC要求，收获它们的任何特殊要求，以及这样做的任何潜在风险。此外，该玩家对该生物所做的任何收割检查都是以优势进行的。一个角色对每个生物只能尝试一次评估检查。",
	"Some party members may prefer to let one character handle the appraisal of materials, while another more dextrous character handles the actual harvesting. In this scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred to the player doing the harvesting, so long as the player that performed the appraising assists the harvesting player through the whole duration of the harvest.": "有些党员可能喜欢让一个角色处理材料的鉴定，而另一个更灵活的角色处理实际的收获。在这种情况下，鉴定生物的所有好处都赋予了进行收获的玩家，只要进行鉴定的玩家在整个收获过程中协助收获的玩家。",
	"The true core of this book: harvesting! Nothing else in this series matters if you cannot learn how this fundamental aspect of our craft. If you take nothing else from this book, take this section, it will serve you time and time again.": "本书的真正核心是：收割！如果你不能学会这个基本的手艺，那么这套书的其他内容都不重要。如果你不能学会我们技艺的这一基本方面，这套书中的其他内容都不重要。如果你从这本书中没有其他收获，就拿这一部分来说吧，它将一次又一次地为你服务。",
	"In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a Dexterity ability check using the same skill proficiency as listed in the above appraising table. For example, a character attempting a harvest check on an Aberration would receive a bonus equal to their Dexterity Modifier and their Proficiency in {@skill Arcana} (if they have any).": "为了收割一个生物，一个角色必须使用与上述鉴定表中所列相同的技能熟练度来进行灵巧能力检查。例如，一个试图对一个畸形人进行收割检查的角色将得到相当于他们的灵巧修饰值和他们的熟练度（%0%）的奖励（如果他们有的话）。",
	"This check reflects a character's ability to not only remove the intended item without damaging it, it also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such as proper preservation and storage techniques.": "这个检查反映了一个角色的能力，不仅可以在不损坏物品的情况下将其取出，还涉及到收获的任何辅助要求，如适当的保存和储存技术。",
	"If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill proficiency.": "如果玩家在收获某种生物，或者收获某种类型的材料的生物，DM可以允许他们使用相关的工具熟练度而不是技能熟练度。",
	"For example, the DM may allow a player to add their proficiency with {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB} to their attempt to harvest a mechanical golem or use their proficiency with {@item leatherworker's tools|PHB} when attempting to harvest a creature for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may be replaced by proficiency with the {@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}.": "例如，DM可以允许玩家在试图收割一个机械巨兽时加入他们的熟练度（%0%），或者在试图收割一个生物的皮时使用他们的熟练度（%1%）。另外，所有生物类型的熟练度都可以用{@item harvesting kit|HHHVI}的熟练度来代替。",
	"Each individual item in a creature's harvesting table is listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item. Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest a {@creature balhannoth|MTF} will reward the player with both \"balhannoth teeth (large bag)\", and \"balhannoth tentacle (×4)\", but not a \"balhannoth hide\". If they so wish, players may opt to not harvest a material even if they have met the DC threshold to harvest it.": "在一个生物的收获表中，每个单独的项目都在旁边列出了一个DC。玩家做出的任何等于或超过该DC的卷轴都会给予该玩家该物品。奖励是累积的，玩家可以得到每件DC等于或低于其能力检查结果的物品。例如，在收获一个{@creature balhannoth|MTF}的检查中掷出15的总分，将奖励玩家 \"巴尔汉诺斯牙齿（大袋）\"和 \"巴尔汉诺斯触手（×4）\"，但不是 \"巴尔汉诺斯皮\"。如果他们愿意，玩家可以选择不收获某种材料，即使他们已经达到了收获它的DC阈值。",
	"Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature. Failure to meet a certain item's DC threshold assumes that the item was made un-salvageable due to the harvester's incompetence.": "一个生物只能进行一次收割尝试。如果不能达到某项物品的DC阈值，则假定该物品是由于收割者的无能而变得无法挽救的。",
	"For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of that material divided by 5. For huge creatures however, it is equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied by 2.": "对于大多数生物来说，收获一种材料所需的时间是以分钟计算的，并且等于该材料的DC除以5。然而对于巨大的生物来说，它等于该材料的DC，而对于巨大的生物，它等于该材料的DC乘以2。",
	"Large or smaller": "大或小",
	"Material DC / 5": "材料 DC / 5",
	"Material DC": "材料 直流",
	"Gargantuan": "巨大的",
	"Material DC × 2": "材料 DC × 2",
	"In my youth, I was considerably more reckless than I am today. Quite often, an errant shot would result in my spoiling an entire pelt! I implore anyone out there that values the quality of their work: aim your shots well and try to finish your prey in one swift go.": "在我年轻的时候，我比现在要鲁莽得多。很多时候，一次错误的射击会导致我毁掉整张毛皮！我恳求任何重视自己工作质量的人：好好瞄准你的射击，并试图一次完成你的猎物。我恳求所有重视工作质量的人：好好瞄准你的射击，并试图一次完成你的猎物。",
	"This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to harvest died in direct combat and thus already accounts for the idea that you are harvesting creatures that may not be in pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent than others and can make harvesting useful materials either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such examples include burning by fire, dissolving from acid, or being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these cases, raise the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5. Alternatively, the DM may decide that well-orchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for harvesting, such as creatures killed mostly through psychic damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases, the DM should lower the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5.": "本指南假定你试图收获的大多数生物都是在直接战斗中死亡的，因此已经考虑到你收获的生物可能不在原始状态。然而，有些死亡比其他死亡更剧烈，会使收获有用的材料变得非常困难或完全不可能。这些例子包括被火烧，被酸溶解，或者被完全压在石柱下。在这些情况下，将收获该生物的任何材料的DC提高5。另外，DM可能会决定，精心安排的狩猎会产生一个适合收获的尸体，例如那些主要通过精神伤害而被杀死的生物，或者那些在一次干净的攻击中被杀死的生物。在这些情况下，DM应该将收获该生物的任何材料的DC降低5。",
	"Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not some of a creature's individual materials have been made useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of their death. Examples may include blood being tainted from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to excessive slashing/piercing damage.": "此外，DM可以裁定一个生物的某些个别材料是否由于它们在死亡过程中施加的影响而变得无用。例子包括血液因中毒而被污染，或者他们的皮毛因过度砍伐/刺伤而变得毫无价值。",
	"There is nothing more thrilling to me than finding a new creature. The idea of hunting it, cutting it open, and then seeing what nature's bounty has in store for me is all the motivation I need to get out of bed in the morning. I have found many new species in my latest adventures and I present my findings to you here, dear reader.": "对我来说，没有什么比发现一种新的生物更令人激动的了。猎取它，把它切开，然后看看大自然的赏赐给我带来了什么，这就是我早上起床的全部动力。我在最近的冒险中发现了许多新物种，我在这里向你介绍我的发现，亲爱的读者。",
	"Every unique monster from {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF} has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide, and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order they are given in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.": "本书中列出了{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}的每个独特怪物，并附有相关的收获表。当你的玩家尝试收获时，只需在本指南中查找相关的怪物，并读出结果（怪物的排列顺序与{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}中的顺序相同）。以下是对如何阅读该表的解释。",
	"This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that respective item.": "这是收获该物品所需的DC。任何等于或超过该阈值的收获检查都允许进行该检查的玩家成功收获该物品。",
	"The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Balhannoth Teeth (large bag) or Maurezhi Blood (3 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.": "收到的物品的名称。虽然对于大多数物品来说，玩家只收到一个列出的物品，但有些物品名称旁边有括号。这些括号表示玩家在成功收获后获得的数量，例如。Balhannoth牙齿（大袋）或Maurezhi血（3瓶）。然而，根据DM的决定，他们可以裁定玩家获得的数量少于或多于规定的数量。这些原因可能包括在掷骰子时获得极高的成功率，或者用某些方法杀死生物。",
	"A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a \"{@b Use}\" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.": "对要收获的物品的简要描述，由Hamund撰写。虽然这通常只是为了调味，但有些物品也有一个\"{@b Use} \"部分。这些物品在收获后可以立即使用，不需要进一步调整或制作。它们的功能在这里的描述框中进行了描述。",
	"Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.": "此外，有些材料的收获要求不仅仅是稳定的手和一把锋利的刀。收获材料的任何额外要求或标准都将在这里列出。",
	"All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependent on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as \"varies\" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.": "所有材料都列出了其基本转售价值。这是一个普通店主愿意为条件良好的材料支付的金额。在改变这个价值时，建议管理员酌情处理，这取决于店主的心情、环境中的稀有程度、材料的状况等等。一个价值为 \"不等 \"的材料表明，它的用途过于特殊，不能卖给普通店主，而且材料的价值在很大程度上取决于背景。",
	"When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Maurezhi Blood is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the value listed (5 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Maurezhi Blood would be worth 3 × 5 gp = 15 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Sibriex Cysts are harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: \"large bag.\" Thus the 650 gp value listed refers to the value of a \"large bag of Sibriex Cysts,\" not 650 gp for each individual cyst.": "当物品以不连续的数量收获时，列出的价值指的是每个单独的物品。例如，Maurezhi血是以一套3瓶的形式收获的，所以列出的价值（5gp）是指每个单独的小瓶（所以成功收获Maurezhi血的价值是3×5gp=15gp）。然而，当物品被列为不连续的数量时，列出的价值是指整个数量。例如，Sibriex Cysts的收获量是不连续的，即一个。\"大袋\"。因此，列出的650戈比的价值是指 \"一大袋Sibriex囊肿 \"的价值，而不是每个囊肿的650戈比。",
	"The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Sibriex Frontal Cortex may be worth the high price of 10,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.": "这里列出的价值是基于无数因素的，包括。怪物的CR，宝藏群的平均价值，在制作过程中的使用，怪物是否倾向于单独被发现，该物品是否是可消耗的，成功收获该物品的概率，围绕现有价格的平衡，有时只是为了增加乐趣。这些价格只是作为一个基线，管理员可以根据他们的活动情况自由调整这些价值。DM还要记住，尽管某些物品可能有很高的价值，但并非所有的供应商都想购买它们。例如，尽管一个Sibriex额叶皮层可能值10,000金币的高价，但要把它卖给村里的杂货商可能很困难。有时，为一件神秘的物品寻找合适的买家本身就可以成为一个有趣的副线任务，或者干脆作为一个很好的休闲活动。",
	"The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do. The listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.": "所列物品的重量，以磅为单位。这里列出的重量遵循与价值相同的规则。所列数字是指单个项目的重量，除非该项目是以不明确的数量收获的，在这种情况下，重量是指整个不明确的数量。",
	"Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.": "有些物品虽然珍贵，但需要熟练的工匠将其制作成可用的物品。材料的描述详细说明了它们可以被制作成哪种物品。如果这部分是空白的，则该物品没有与之相关的可制作的物品。",
	"The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.": "本书末尾的制作物品部分详细介绍了制作物品的用法，以及它们的制作要求的细节。一些可制作的物品源自WotC出版的源书。这些物品在括号里有特殊的标签，表示它们来自哪本书。",
	"Once again, I must caution my readers against harvesting humanoids. The job is messy and of dubious ethics at best. I would advise you to take the marginally more acceptable practice of corpse-looting: at the very least it will be more financially rewarding.": "我必须再次告诫我的读者，不要采摘人形生物。这项工作很混乱，而且充其量是一种可疑的道德规范。我建议你采取稍微可以接受的做法，即盗取尸体：至少它在经济上会有更大的回报。",
	"Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armor. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.": "本书中列出的大多数人形生物并不拥有许多可供收获的有用材料。为了补充人形生物相对较少的表格，在他们的章节中列出了一个单独的表格，描述可以从这些生物身上掠夺的物品。这些物品往往是随机的小玩意，不是武器或盔甲。更多的时候，它们是相对无用的，只打算用来转卖。",
	"There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.": "偷窃这些饰品不需要检查能力，而且DM可以自由决定这些饰品中哪些可以在典型的尸体上找到（如果有的话）。这些表格的目的主要是作为DM的灵感，在避免肢解人形尸体的恶心活动的同时，满足渴望掠夺的玩家的欲望。",
	"Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.": "与所有收获的物品一样，列出的价值和重量是指该行中各自物品的1个单位。",
	"I was once compared to an astral dreadnought by a rather bitter critic. I believe the implication was that, like the dreadnought, I was a rampaging disaster that devoured and took everything that I laid my eyes on. The joke is on them however, since I actually find that comparison to be not just accurate, but also quite flattering.": "我曾经被一个相当严厉的批评家比作星际无畏舰。我相信他的意思是，像无畏舰一样，我是一个横冲直撞的灾难，吞噬和夺取我所看到的一切。但这是他们的笑话，因为我实际上发现这种比较不仅准确，而且相当讨人喜欢。",
	"For most of society, it is a blessed day when a necromancer fails their phylactery ritual. That is because in these cases, instead of creating an all-powerful lich, a much more benign boneclaw is created instead. For me however, the stroke of luck comes in the fact that it creates a corporeal creature that is able to be harvested.": "对于社会上的大多数人来说，当一个死灵法师的法器仪式失败时，是一个受祝福的日子。这是因为在这些情况下，不是创造了一个全能的巫师，而是创造了一个更为温和的骨爪。然而对我来说，幸运之处在于它创造了一个能够被收割的肉身生物。",
	"In my younger and more experimental days, I once tried to capture and reprogram a cadaver collector to be my assistant. It seemed sensible at the time; we did both share the same penchant for reusing the bodies of what we hunt. However, while I was mildly successful in making it become my travelling companion, I had to dismiss it from my service due to its habit of spearing all my hunts on its back, thus ruining perfectly good pelts and organs. Oh well, I still got some use out of it; I took it apart and used the findings to make this entry!": "在我年轻和更具实验性的日子里，我曾经试图捕获并重新编程一个尸体收集者，使其成为我的助手。这在当时看来是合理的；我们确实都有同样的爱好，即重复使用我们所猎取的尸体。然而，虽然我在使它成为我的旅行伙伴方面取得了轻微的成功，但由于它习惯于在背上刺穿我所有的猎物，从而破坏了完美的皮毛和器官，我不得不将它从我的服务中解雇。哦，好吧，我还是从它身上得到了一些用处；我把它拆开，用它的发现做了这篇报道!",
	"The infamous gnomish clockwork constructs have an interesting role in the great taxonomy of harvestable creatures (if you can even call them that). Because the methods of their creation are relatively well known, relatively intact specimens can be salvaged by any knowledgeable tinker into a working state. Not saying that you have to, but maybe keep it in mind before you go about melting their insides and whatnot.": "臭名昭著的地精钟表结构在可收获生物的伟大分类学中扮演了一个有趣的角色（如果你甚至可以这样称呼它们）。因为它们的制造方法相对来说是众所周知的，相对完整的标本可以被任何知识渊博的修理工抢救到工作状态。我不是说你必须这样做，但在你融化它们的内脏和其他东西之前，也许要牢记这一点。",
	"Instead of harvesting the individual pieces of a clockwork, you may instead attempt to salvage the entirety of the creature to be fixed up by a well-supplied {@optfeature tinker|HHHVI}. If you wish to do this, roll a {@dice d20}. On a result of 18 or higher, the clockwork is in a good enough state to be repaired. You may still harvest a clockwork even if it is found to not be in a state of potential repair. Your DM may also decide that a clockwork that died under exceptional circumstances cannot be salvaged whatsoever (such as if it was completely melted into slag).": "你可以不收割发条的单个碎片，而是尝试抢救整个生物，由一个供应充足的（%0%）来修复。如果你想这样做，请掷出（%1%）。当结果为18或更高时，发条的状态就足以被修复了。即使发现一个钟表不在可能的修复状态，你仍然可以收获它。你的管理员也可以决定，在特殊情况下死亡的发条不能被抢救（比如它被完全融化成渣）。",
	"A repairable clockwork may be brought to any {@optfeature tinker|HHHVI} and fixed at a fee of 300 gp, and 1 week per hit die (this fee only covers material expenses; labour fees may vary from {@optfeature tinker|HHHVI} to {@optfeature tinker|HHHVI}). Once created, a clockwork will gain loyalty to the first creature it sees and will follow their directions to the best of their ability until it is reduced to 0 hit points again, at which point it becomes permanently unsalvageable and un-harvestable.": "一个可修复的发条可以被带到任何一个{@optfeature tinker|HHHVI}的地方进行修复，费用为300金币，每个命中率为1周（这个费用只包括材料费；人工费可能从{@optfeature tinker|HHHVI}到{@optfeature tinker|HHHVI}不等）。一旦被创造出来，发条会获得对它看到的第一个生物的忠诚，并会尽其所能地听从他们的指挥，直到它的命中率再次降至0，在这一点上，它就会变得永久无法修复，无法收获。",
	"I once had a nasty run in with a corpse flower. I had been hunting down a rather wicked derro that had murdered one of my travelling companions, and I had finally managed to corner to villain and avenge my friend. Before I managed to extract a trophy however, a corpse flower appeared, grabbed the corpse, then dissolved it before my very eyes! Well, the last laugh was mine, as I killed that corpse flower and took one of its leaves as a proxy prize.": "有一次，我和一朵尸花发生了不愉快的冲突。我一直在追捕一个相当邪恶的德鲁人，他杀害了我的一个旅伴，我终于成功地把这个恶棍逼到了角落，为我的朋友报了仇。然而，在我成功地提取战利品之前，一朵尸花出现了，它抓住了尸体，然后在我眼前把它溶化了！这是我的最后一笑。好吧，最后的笑声是我的，因为我杀了那朵尸花，拿了它的一片叶子作为代理奖品。",
	"I am at my wit's end when it comes to demons. I have tried holy water, I have tried magical rituals, I have tried throwing salt on them at the time of their deaths; absolutely NOTHING can keep them from dissolving into a useless ichor. Do you know how inconvenient it is to have to go to the Abyss every time I need to collect some rutterkin livers? I am an incredibly busy man!": "谈到恶魔，我束手无策。我试过圣水，我试过魔法仪式，我试过在他们死的时候往他们身上撒盐；绝对没有任何东西可以让他们不溶化成无用的ichor。你知道每次我需要收集一些拉特金的肝脏时都要去深渊是多么不方便吗？我是一个令人难以置信的大忙人!",
	"Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.": "由于它们的深渊性质，在物质世界被杀的恶魔不能被收割，因为它们的尸体会溶解成一种恶臭的ichor。这种ichor没有任何作用，实际上是无用的。为了正确地收获恶魔，他们必须在深渊中被杀死。",
	"Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic.

Not because of their dreadful situation, but because their corpses were almost certainly more valuable in their original forms; meazel corpses simply don't have that much to offer in terms of utility. Truly the Shadowfell knows how to rob even someone like me of their simple pleasures.": "真的没有什么比一个被影子城抓走并被转化为meazel的人更令人沮丧的了。不是因为他们可怕的处境，而是因为他们的尸体在原来的形式下几乎肯定更有价值；meazel的尸体在效用方面根本没有那么多。影子城真的知道如何抢夺甚至像我这样的人的简单快乐。",
	"I must clear my name and state that I had nothing to do with the death of the nightwalker that I harvested to make this entry.

	"I have met many, many ogres in my travels and none of them have displayed any aptitude for crafting or metalworking. Not only that, the goblins that they often associate with also display a distinct lack of patience for the finer weapon smithing arts. This only leads me to ask: where in the world are these ogres finding such large equipment to match their size?": "我在旅行中遇到过很多很多食人魔，但他们都没有表现出任何工艺或金属加工的能力。不仅如此，他们经常与之交往的地精也表现出对精细的武器冶炼艺术明显缺乏耐心。这让我不禁要问：这些食人魔到底在哪里找到与它们的体型相匹配的大型设备？",
	"I must confess that I actually encountered frost salamanders before I met their fiery cousins. This led me to believe that the frost salamander was actually the default variety, and I ended up referring to the fire-based variety as \"fire salamanders\" for quite some time. The uncles at the Hamund clan hall still joke about it whenever I go back for family reunions.": "我必须承认，在我遇到它们的火系表亲之前，我实际上遇到了冰霜蝾螈。这使我相信霜螈实际上是默认的品种，而我最终在相当长的一段时间内把火系品种称为 \"火螈\"。每当我回去参加家庭聚会时，哈蒙德氏族大厅的叔叔们仍然会拿这个开玩笑。",
	"The shadar-kai are elves with the dubious honour of being blessed by the Raven Queen, having their forms altered to both serve her and survive in the Shadowfell. I'll admit that I'm rather curious what other races would have looked like if they instead had been chosen by the Raven Queen, but I suppose a shadar-halfling would be more amusing than intimidating.": "shadar-kai是受到乌鸦女王祝福的精灵，他们的形态被改变，既能为她服务，又能在阴影地带生存。我承认我很好奇，如果其他种族被乌鸦女王选中，他们会是什么样子，但我想沙达-哈夫林会更有趣，而不是吓人。",

	"If there's anything that drives me up a wall, it's a creature that doesn't leave behind a stable corpse to harvest. When I killed a larva mage and saw it dispersing into writhing vermin, I was just about ready to cry out in frustration. However, on a lark, I tried harvesting the worms instead. To my delight, the attempt was successful (and also quite profitable). I'm not sure what the moral of this story is, something to do with never giving up, I suppose?": "如果说有什么东西能让我心烦意乱，那就是没有留下稳定的尸体来收割的生物。当我杀了一个幼虫法师，看到它分散成蠕动的害虫时，我正准备沮丧地大叫。然而，在一次闲聊中，我试着收割虫子而不是。令我高兴的是，这次尝试很成功（而且还相当有利可图）。我不知道这个故事的寓意是什么，我想应该是与永不放弃有关吧？",

	"I've always wondered: if a sword wraith is formed when a soldier dies before seeing glory in battle, is it possible for a harvesting wraith to be formed when a harvester dies before snagging their dream trophy? Much like the actual sword wraiths that I slew to make this entry, this question haunted me for quite some time. In the end, I decided that the best way for me to avoid this hypothetical fate was to ensure that I harvested anything and everything that I set my fancy to.": "我一直想知道：如果一个士兵在看到战斗的荣耀之前死亡，就会形成一个剑灵，那么当一个收割者在抢到他们梦想的奖杯之前死亡，有没有可能形成一个收割灵？就像我为了写这篇文章而杀死的那些真正的剑虫一样，这个问题困扰了我很久。最后，我决定避免这种假设的命运的最好办法是确保我收割我所看中的任何东西。",
	"I've always liked tortles. Their natural wanderlust makes them fantastic travelling companions, and their ability to carry large quantities of supplies on their shells make them fantastic porters. Although I have ended up autopsying a few of the tortles that travelled with me, I must state that I obtained their express, oral permission to do so just before they died...or at least I'm pretty sure that's what they said.": "我一直很喜欢龟类。它们天生的流浪癖使它们成为出色的旅行伙伴，而它们用壳携带大量物资的能力使它们成为出色的搬运工。虽然我最后解剖了几只和我一起旅行的托特犬，但我必须说明，在它们死之前，我得到了它们明确的口头许可......或者至少我很确定它们是这么说的。",
	"I do wish that other creatures had the adaptable nature that the trolls do. Imagine being able to enter a new biome and finding the same creatures but with a wonderful new spin on them. I'll tell you what, it would certainly keep the sense of adventure alive (as opposed to all the creatures that I would soon be harvesting).": "我确实希望其他生物能有巨魔那样的适应性。想象一下，能够进入一个新的生物群落，发现同样的生物，但却有一个奇妙的新变化。我告诉你，这肯定会保持冒险的感觉（相对于我很快就要收获的所有生物而言）。",
	"I thank whatever fate decided that yugoloth ichor is actually valuable, unlike the ichor of regular fiends. It is especially good because I have had to fend off many yugoloths after a lifetime of contracting them for expeditions and neglecting to pay for their services. They never seem to understand that by including them in my books, I am practically overcompensating them in publicity!": "我感谢什么命运决定了尤戈洛人的血清实际上是有价值的，不像普通魔人的血清。这特别好，因为我不得不抵制许多尤戈洛人，因为我一生都在与他们签订远征合同，却忽略了支付他们的服务。他们似乎永远不明白，把他们写进我的书里，我实际上是在宣传上对他们进行了过度补偿！这就是我的工作。",
	"Like regular devils, yugoloths slain outside of their native plane also dissolve into an ichor rather than leave behind a corpse. Given the yugoloths artificial nature however, this ichor tends to be more useful than devil ichor and can be harvested for some benefit.": "像普通的魔鬼一样，在他们的本位面之外被杀的尤戈洛人也会溶入一种ichor，而不是留下一具尸体。然而，鉴于尤戈洛人的人工性质，这种ichor往往比魔鬼的ichor更有用，可以收获一些好处。",
	"Either way, a yugoloth slain outside of Gehenna cannot be harvested for anything except their respective ichor. Yugoloths slain on Gehenna can be harvested like a regular creature, including their ichor, traces of which can still be found in their veins.": "不管怎么说，在Gehenna之外被杀的尤格罗人除了他们各自的ichor外，不能被收获任何东西。在Gehenna上被杀的尤格罗人可以像普通生物一样被收割，包括他们的ichor，在他们的血管中仍然可以找到痕迹。",

I present their latest findings to you here, dear reader.": "手工艺人的聪明才智和创造力从来都让我震惊。我们收割者每发现一种新材料，他们就会发现一种新的方法，使它们变得更加令人震惊和强大。亲爱的读者，我在这里向你介绍他们的最新发现。",
	"While some creature parts are useful fresh from the carcass, many require some alterations before their full potential can be realised.

	"Like the claws of a gargantuan lobster, the astral dreadnought's claws are meant only for the crushing and destruction of its foes. Far too large to be wielded by an ordinary adventurer, these claws have found their use as rams installed on massive astral galleys and used to sink hapless travelers.": "就像一只巨大的龙虾的爪子，星际无畏舰的爪子只为粉碎和摧毁它的敌人而存在。这些爪子太大，普通的冒险者无法挥舞，它们被用作安装在巨大的星际大帆船上的撞锤，用来击沉无助的旅行者。",

	"Astral Dreadnought Eye": "星际无畏之眼",
	"Much like the more ubiquitous {@creature beholder|MM}, the lone eye of the astral dreadnought has the ability to shut down magical energy wherever it gazes.

	"Although deadly when set into the jaw of its original owner, the teeth of a balhannoth are far too irregular to be crafted into practical weaponry. However, these twisted ivories can be ground down into a fine powder, mixed with hallucinogens, fermented, and then imbibed as a nightcap drink called languish. Languish fills the drinker's sleep with good dreams and allows them to live their fantasies for a few hours in the night. But, as with most things originating in the Shadowfell, languish is a double edged sword. It is highly addictive, and those who become dependent on it often find their waking lives to become dull and empty.": "虽然镶在原主人的下巴上是致命的，但巴尔汉诺斯的牙齿太不规则了，无法被制作成实用的武器。然而，这些扭曲的象牙可以被磨成细粉，与致幻剂混合，发酵，然后作为一种叫做 \"慵懒 \"的睡前饮料饮用。Languish使饮酒者的睡眠中充满了好梦，并使他们在夜里的几个小时内实现自己的幻想。但是，和大多数源自影子城的东西一样，\"慵懒 \"是一把双刃剑。它非常容易上瘾，那些对它产生依赖的人经常发现他们清醒的生活变得枯燥和空虚。",

	"Berbalang Brain": "Berbalang大脑",
	"One of a berbalang's more interesting abilities is its creation of spectral duplicates created through sheer force of will.

	"Although it is imperfect, a boneclaw still possesses a phylactery like a real lich; or it is more accurate to say that the phylactery possesses it. In a mockery of their failure to perform the ritual correctly, a boneclaw is indentured to a mortal creature who serves as the boneclaw's phylactery. So long as the creature lives, so does the boneclaw. It is not always clear who acts as the boneclaw's phylactery, sometimes not even to the boneclaw itself. To circumvent this, certain enchantments can be performed on a well preserved boneclaw head, allowing one to track down the living phylactery and end the menace of the boneclaw, once and for all.": "虽然不完美，但骨爪仍然像真正的巫师一样拥有一个法器；或者更准确地说，法器拥有它。作为对他们未能正确完成仪式的嘲弄，骨爪会与一个凡人生物签订契约，作为骨爪的法器。只要这个生物活着，骨爪也就活着。谁是骨爪的护身符并不总是很清楚，有时甚至对骨爪本身也不清楚。为了规避这一点，可以对保存完好的骨爪头进行某些魔法，让人们能够追踪到活着的法器，并一劳永逸地结束骨爪的威胁。",

This oil is highly sought for its ability to preserve corpses regardless of their level of putrefaction, and can be used by anyone to rival the skills of even the greatest embalmer.": "就像任何机器一样，尸体收集器需要润滑剂来保持其齿轮和关节的顺利运转。然而，尸体收集器使用的是更卑鄙的来源：腐烂的尸体的血液和肉质。当这种可怕的混合物覆盖并在地狱结构中循环时，它会催化成一种被称为殡仪馆油的物质。这种油因其保存尸体的能力而备受追捧，无论其腐烂程度如何，任何人都可以使用，甚至可以与最伟大的防腐师的技能相媲美。",
	"Cadaver Collector Face Plate": "尸体收集器面盘",
	"Those that have fought a cadaver collector and lived will agree that although the corpses that adorn its body are terrifying, the thing that lingers in the mind for years after is its hollow, unblinking visage.

In particular, the cartilage is often sought after by tinkers attempting to add realistic joints to their mechanical constructs.": "吊环的管状软骨使它具有很大的灵活性和适应性，但却没有牺牲其本身的结构完整性。由于这个原因，软骨作为一种工艺材料，从绳索到缰绳都很珍贵。特别是，软骨经常被试图在他们的机械构造中添加真实关节的修补者所追捧。",
	"Choker Claw (×2)": "钳形爪 (×2)",
	"The starfish-shaped claws of a choker are lined with dozens of small pins that trap a victim's throat much like a bird being caught in a tangle of thorny vines. While they are impractical to use as weapons for an ordinary humanoid, they can be used as climbing aids by the intrepid adventurer (if you can get over the squelching sensation when touching them).": "钳子的海星形爪子上有几十个小针，可以困住受害者的喉咙，就像鸟儿被纠缠在带刺的藤蔓中一样。虽然它们作为普通人的武器是不切实际的，但它们可以被勇敢的冒险家用作攀登的辅助工具（如果你能克服触摸它们时的压迫感）。",
	"While holding these claws, you have advantage on Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks to climb difficult surfaces.": "当持有这些爪子时，你在力量（（%0%））检查中具有优势，可以爬上困难的表面。",
	"The internal mechanisms of the clockwork constructs can seem almost like magic for anyone not trained in the tinkering and gnomish sciences. While they may vary from model to model (and indeed, even among the same type of clockwork), they all share the same design for the core set of gears that power its lifelike movements. Tinkers of all breeds value these mastercrafted servos to use in their own creations, and will pay a decent price to avoid having to make them on their own.": "对于没有接受过工匠和地精科学训练的人来说，发条结构的内部机制几乎就像魔法一样。虽然它们可能因型号而异（事实上，即使是同一类型的发条），但它们的核心齿轮组都有相同的设计，为其逼真的运动提供动力。所有种类的工匠都很重视这些大师级的伺服机，以便在他们自己的作品中使用，并会支付一个体面的价格来避免自己制作它们。",
	"Quartz Plating": "石英镀层",
	"The plating of the bronze scout is forged from a unique method that incorporates quartz and minerals into the smelting process. The result is an alloy that not only resonates with the earth, but also has a distinctive amber tone. Unfortunately, the former trait quickly dissipates once disconnected from the construct, but it still retains the attractive coloring and can be recrafted into a rather fetching suit of armor.": "青铜侦察兵的镀层是用一种独特的方法锻造的，在冶炼过程中加入了石英和矿物质。其结果是一种合金，不仅能与大地产生共鸣，而且还具有独特的琥珀色调。不幸的是，一旦与构造物分离，前者的特性就会迅速消散，但它仍然保留着诱人的颜色，可以重新制作成一套相当漂亮的盔甲。",
	"Volt Core": "伏特核心",
	"The bronze scout is not built for combat, but it does possess a few tricks up its sleeves (despite its lack of arms). The most notable is a literally shocking ability to release a wave of lightning along the ground to distract its foes while it burrows to safety. The core responsible for this is fragile however, and only recharges when still attached to a functioning scout. As such, although it is useful in a pinch, it is a strictly one-time use item only.": "青铜侦察兵不是为战斗而生的，但它确实拥有一些技巧（尽管它没有手臂）。最值得一提的是，它有一种令人震惊的能力，可以沿着地面释放出一波闪电，以分散敌人的注意力，而它则钻到安全地带。然而，负责这一功能的核心是脆弱的，只有当它仍然连接在一个正常的侦察兵身上时才会充电。因此，尽管它在紧要关头很有用，但严格来说，它只是一个一次性使用的项目。",
	"This item can only be harvested if the bronze scout had its {@i lightning flare} ability available at the time of its death.": "只有在青铜侦察兵死亡时有其{@i lightning flare}的能力时，才能收获这个物品。",
	"As an action, you may throw this item at the ground up to 15 feet away from you, causing it to explode on impact. All creatures touching the ground within 15 feet of the explosion must make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 2d6} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "作为一个动作，你可以把这个东西扔到离你15英尺远的地面上，使它在撞击时爆炸。所有在爆炸范围内接触地面的生物必须做一个{@dc 13}灵巧的救赎，如果救赎失败会受到{@damage 2d6}雷电伤害，如果救赎成功会受到一半的伤害。",
	"Ironleather Hide": "铁皮藏品",
	"As implied by their name, the iron cobra is covered in a thick hide of iron plates. However, in order to replicate the articulation of a real cobra, gnomish tinkers mastered a smelting process to create an alloy that flexes and moves like real skin. Taking it back to an experienced blacksmith allows it to be repurposed into a comfortable and surprisingly lightweight armor that does not sacrifice protection.": "正如它们的名字所暗示的那样，铁眼镜蛇被一层厚厚的铁皮所覆盖。然而，为了复制真正的眼镜蛇的衔接，地精工匠们掌握了一种冶炼工艺，创造出一种合金，可以像真正的皮肤一样弯曲和移动。把它拿回给有经验的铁匠，可以把它重新组合成一个舒适和令人惊讶的轻量级盔甲，而且不会牺牲保护。",
	"Artificial Venom (vial)": "人工毒液（小瓶装）",
	"Much like a real cobra, the iron cobra's fangs are loaded with deadly venom to inject into its victims. However, in the classic gnome habit of overcomplicating their work, the iron cobra is also loaded with other more nefarious concoctions not found in nature.": "和真正的眼镜蛇一样，铁眼镜蛇的獠牙上装有致命的毒液，可以注入受害者体内。然而，根据地精的典型习惯，他们的工作过于复杂，铁眼镜蛇还装有自然界中没有的其他更邪恶的调制物。",
	"When you harvest this material, you receive a random venom that imposes the same effect as one of the poison effects listed under the iron cobra's {@i bite} ability. All venoms can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the venom takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of the appropriate venom.": "当你收获这种材料时，你会得到一种随机的毒液，其施加的效果与铁眼镜蛇（%0%）能力下所列的毒药效果之一相同。所有的毒液都可以用来涂抹最多5件切割或穿刺的弹药或一件切割或穿刺的武器。涂抹毒液需要1分钟。在接下来的一分钟内，任何被成功击中的生物都必须在宪法规定的投掷中获得成功，否则就会受到相应毒液的影响。",
	"Oaken Bolter Bolt (×10)": "橡木枪栓(×10)",
	"Despite its superior reinforcement and demonstrable power, the ammunition of an oaken bolter is far too large to be wielded by an ordinary arbalest. That said, fortresses and armies would pay a decent amount to add these bolts to their own armories to be loaded into their ballistae and siege weapons.": "尽管它具有卓越的加固能力和明显的威力，但橡木枪的弹药太大，普通的弓箭手无法挥舞。也就是说，要塞和军队会支付一笔不菲的费用，将这些炮弹添加到他们自己的军械库中，装入他们的弹弓和攻城武器。",
	"Oaken Bolter Harpoon": "橡木棒鱼叉",
	"The harpoon of an oaken bolter is of a slightly more sophisticated design than the standard fare wielded by whalers and big-game hunters. The smaller hooks are specially designed to target smaller creatures and are favored by sieging armies for their ability to pull defenders from fortress walls.": "橡木枪的鱼叉比捕鲸者和大型猎物猎人所挥舞的标准鱼叉设计得更复杂。较小的鱼钩是专门针对较小的生物而设计的，并因其能够将守军从堡垒墙上拉下来而受到围攻军队的青睐。",
	"Oaken Bolter Explosive Core": "奥肯炮弹爆炸核心",
	"To aid its destructive capabilities, the oaken bolter is capable of synthesizing an explosive charge on its bolts to deal massive damage to large groups of enemies simultaneously. Although it loses the ability to create new charges once it is detached from the rest of the mechanism, the core still carries one final charge to be detonated once sufficient force is applied.": "为了帮助它的破坏能力，橡木枪能够在它的枪弹上合成炸药，对大群敌人同时造成巨大伤害。尽管一旦它与机制的其他部分分离，它就失去了创造新炸药的能力，但核心仍然携带一个最后的炸药，一旦施加足够的力量就会引爆。",
	"As an action, you may throw this item to a space up to 20 feet away, causing it to explode on impact. Anything within 20 feet of the explosion must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 3d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "作为一个动作，你可以把这个物品扔到20英尺以外的地方，使它在撞击时爆炸。爆炸范围内的任何东西都必须做一个{@dc 15}灵巧的蓄力动作，蓄力失败会受到{@damage 3d6}的火焰伤害，蓄力成功会受到一半的伤害。",
	"Oaken Bolter Gear": "奥克尔博尔特装备",
	"The system that operates the firing mechanism of the oaken bolter is far more complicated than that of an ordinary crossbow. At the heart of it is a highly specialized piece of gnomish engineering that loads and fires bolts faster and more reliably than humanly possible. Removing the piece is an intricate and delicate process, but tinkers can take a working sample and use it to make a weapon that has the same versatility as that of the original construct.": "操作橡木枪的发射装置的系统比普通的十字弓要复杂得多。它的核心是一个高度专业化的地精工程，可以比人类更快、更可靠地装填和发射炮弹。拆除这个部件是一个复杂而微妙的过程，但工匠们可以取一个工作样本，用它来制造一个具有与原始构造同样多功能性的武器。",
	"Stone Shield (×2)": "石头盾牌 (×2)",
	"The master masonry of the stone defender's towering shields cannot be denied. Indeed, more often than not, an ambitious gnome will commission their dwarvish neighbors to ensure quality workmanship and sturdiness. Unfortunately, as is often found in the inventions of the zealous gnomes, they are also far too heavy and impractical to be wielded by an ordinary combatant into battle. As such, they are useful for little more than resale to other stonemasons as building material.": "石头防御者高耸的盾牌的石匠大师是不可否认的。事实上，更多时候，雄心勃勃的地精会委托他们的矮人邻居来确保高质量的做工和坚固性。不幸的是，正如在狂热的地精的发明中经常发现的那样，它们也太重了，而且不切实际，不能被普通的战斗人员挥舞着上战场。因此，它们除了作为建筑材料转卖给其他石匠之外，没有什么用处。",
	"Copperstone Joint": "铜矿石接头",
	"The mere fact that a stone defender can lift its shields is an engineering marvel; the fact that it can swing them with enough force to knock down foes larger than itself is nothing short of a miracle. Indeed, the copperstone joint in the construct responsible for this is so intricate and advanced that it can almost seem to have been made through divine intervention. It is difficult to remove without damaging it, but if done so, it can be customized to give a weapon a very powerful follow through.": "石头防卫者能举起盾牌，这仅仅是一个工程奇迹；它能以足够的力量挥舞盾牌击倒比自己大的敌人，这不啻为一个奇迹。事实上，负责这项工作的构造中的铜石关节是如此复杂和先进，几乎可以说是通过神的干预而制成的。它很难在不损坏它的情况下被移除，但如果这样做，它可以被定制，以使武器具有非常强大的后续能力。",
	"As part of its unnatural germination, a corpse flower subsists and grows almost entirely on the rotting corpses of humanoid creatures. Due to this, the fibers that constitute the vines of this horrid plant are a fair degree more...animalistic in nature. The material of these writing tendrils more resembles living flesh, and it leaks sap as if it were blood. As such, other than being used for necromantic rituals, they can also be quite good for trying to add a bit of roughage to a carnivorous pet's diet.": "作为其非自然发芽的一部分，尸体花几乎完全靠人形生物的腐烂尸体来生存和生长。由于这个原因，构成这种可怕植物的藤蔓的纤维在相当程度上更具有......动物的性质。这些书写卷须的材料更像活生生的肉体，而且它渗出的汁液就像血液一样。因此，除了用于亡灵仪式之外，它们还可以很好地尝试为食肉宠物的饮食添加一点粗粮。",
	"Corpse Flower Petal (×5)": "尸体花瓣 (×5)",
	"The flowers of the corpse flower bloom with the sickly reds and yellows of a bloated cadaver. Death cults and warlike civilizations have been known to grind these petals up into pigments for warpaint that when applied, whip up the users into a deathcrazed frenzy.": "尸体花的花朵绽放出臃肿的尸体的病态的红色和黄色。众所周知，死亡教派和好战的文明将这些花瓣磨成颜料，用于战争涂料，一旦使用，就会使使用者陷入死亡的狂热中。",
	"Rot Musk (vial)": "腐烂的麝香(小瓶)",
	"To be honest, the stench of the corpse flower is worse than the slimy grip of its tentacles; it can best be described as death trying to cram itself into your body via your nostrils. This stench originates from a pool of liquid musk at the center of its writhing mass which contains the plant's digestive enzymes and is used to turn the flower's victims into a putrid soup.": "说实话，尸花的臭味比它的触手的粘稠度更糟糕；它可以被描述为死亡试图通过你的鼻孔挤进你的身体。这种臭味源于它的蠕动中心的一池液态麝香，它含有植物的消化酶，用来把花的受害者变成腐烂的汤。",
	"You may uncork this vial as an action, releasing its horrid stench. All creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of you that are not a construct or undead must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is {@condition incapacitated} until the end of the turn. Creatures that are immune to poison damage or the {@condition poisoned} condition automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the stench of this item and all corpse flowers for 24 hours. Alternatively, you may pour the contents of this vial on a corpse that is medium sized or smaller. If you do so, that corpse immediately disintegrates into a soft mush. If this mush is left on fertile soil, it seeps into it, causing a new corpse flower to grow there in {@dice 1d4} days.": "你可以在行动中打开这个小瓶，释放出它可怕的臭味。所有在你10英尺范围内的生物，如果不是构筑物或不死生物，都必须做一个{@dc 14}体质救赎动作。拯救失败时，生物会被{@condition incapacitated}，直到该回合结束。对毒药伤害或{@condition poisoned}条件免疫的生物会自动成功地进行这个救赎。拯救成功后，生物会在24小时内对这个物品和所有尸花的臭味免疫。另外，你可以将这个小瓶的内容倒在一个中等大小的尸体上。如果你这样做，那具尸体会立即解体成软泥。如果把这种软泥留在肥沃的土壤上，它就会渗入其中，在{@dice 1d4}天内使那里长出新的尸花。",
	"This item degrades {@dice 2d4} days after the death of its original corpse flower, becoming a useless (but still unpleasant) liquid.": "此物品在其原始尸花死亡后的几天内会退化（%0%），成为一种无用的（但仍然令人不快的）液体。",
	"The black heart of a deathlock no longer serves any useful biological function. In fact, more often than not, it has ossified from exposure to necromantic energies and more resembles an anatomical model than an actual organ. While the necromantic energies seeped into it are relatively weak, they are admittedly quite captivating to look at, and some shadier mages have been known to use the heart as a morbid arcane focus.": "死锁的黑心不再有任何有用的生物功能。事实上，更多的时候，它已经因为暴露在死灵能量中而僵化，更像一个解剖学模型而不是一个真正的器官。虽然渗入其中的死灵能量相对较弱，但不得不承认，它们是相当吸引人的，而且一些阴暗的法师已经知道将心脏作为一个病态的奥术焦点。",
	"Chained Soul": "被锁住的灵魂",
	"A deathlock rises when the spirit of a mortal bound to a patron fails to uphold their end of a pact. When this occurs, their soul is chained by their wrathful patron, refused entry to the afterlife, and hurtled back into their former body to resume their duty. While this is tragic for the deathlock, this chaining also makes their spirit particularly easy to capture in a ream of spirit paper and made to do your own bidding. {@b Requires {@item spirit paper|HHHVI}.}": "当一个被束缚在守护者身边的凡人的灵魂未能履行他们的契约时，死锁就会出现。当这种情况发生时，他们的灵魂会被愤怒的守护者锁住，被拒绝进入来世，并被扔回他们以前的身体，继续履行他们的职责。虽然这对死神来说是个悲剧，但这种锁链也使他们的灵魂特别容易被抓进一卷灵纸里，让他们为你效劳。{@b Requires {@item spirit paper|HHHVI}.}",
	"As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the vengeful spirit trapped inside which takes the form of a {@creature specter|MM} (the DM has the creature's statistics) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This specter acts next round on its own initiative and follows any verbal orders you give it (no action required). The specter lasts for 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, after which it disappears.": "作为一个行动，你可以撕开这个物品，释放被困在里面的复仇之魂，它以一个（%0%）（DM有该生物的统计数据）的形式出现在你5英尺内的一个无人空间。这个幽灵下一轮会主动行动，并听从你给它的任何口头命令（不需要行动）。幽灵持续1分钟或直到它的命中率降至0，之后它就会消失。",
	"Death Claw (×2)": "死亡之爪 (×2)",
	"Although a deathlock is certainly adept in many dark forms of magic, its physical attributes are not to be laughed at either. In order to ensure that they have the tools to complete their mission, a deathlock's patron grants them a claw powered by necromantic energy that rends the lifeforce from whomever it touches. Proper harvesting of the claw requires one to carve along the ley lines of the wrist to avoid severing its connection to the patron, but when done properly, it can be refashioned into a most wicked weapon.": "虽然死锁肯定擅长许多黑暗形式的魔法，但它的身体属性也是不容小觑的。为了确保他们有工具来完成他们的任务，死锁的守护者授予他们一只由死灵能量驱动的爪子，可以从它所接触的人身上撕裂生命力。正确地收获这只爪子需要沿着手腕的雷电线进行雕刻，以避免切断它与守护者的联系，但如果操作得当，它可以被改造成一件最邪恶的武器。",
	"Patron's Favor": "赞助人的青睐",
	"The deathlocks that have managed to redeem their worth in their patron's eyes are granted greater powers that rival the ones they had in life. This time around however, the deathlock's pact is sealed onto their body to prevent their misuse and squandering. This comes in the form of a brand somewhere on the deathlock that glows with other-planar energy. If harvested intact, the power of the patron can be stolen and repurposed to grant a mage a boost to their arcane abilities. Just don't let the surviving followers of the patron track you down afterwards though...": "在他们的赞助人眼中，成功挽回自己价值的死锁会被授予更大的力量，与他们生前的力量相媲美。然而这一次，死锁的契约被封印在他们的身上，以防止他们被滥用和挥霍。它的形式是在死锁的某处打上一个烙印，发出其他星球能量的光芒。如果能完整地收获，守护者的力量可以被窃取并重新利用，从而使法师的奥术能力得到提升。只是不要让守护者幸存的追随者在事后追踪你......",
	"Alkilith Acid (vial)": "烷烃酸(小瓶)",
	"The strength of an alkilith is lackluster compared to other more ferocious demons. As such, instead of bludgeoning or slashing their victims to death, the alkilith prefers to coat its foes in a potent acid that eats flesh and metal alike. The acid unfortunately loses much of its potency quickly after the death of the alkilith, but is still very useful for various cultists that use it to clean demonic artifacts.": "与其他更凶猛的恶魔相比，阿基里斯的力量是乏善可陈的。因此，白化石不喜欢用棍棒或刀剑将受害者打死，而是喜欢用一种强效的酸液来涂抹它的敌人，这种酸液可以吞噬肉体和金属。不幸的是，这种酸液在阿基里斯死后很快就失去了它的效力，但对于那些用它来清洗恶魔文物的各种邪教徒来说仍然非常有用。",
	"Alkilith Spore (vial)": "阿尔基里斯孢子(小瓶)",
	"Like many of the more mundane forms of mold and fungus, the presence of an alkilith can wreak havoc on a creature's health due to the inhalation of tiny spores. However, the alkilith's effect is much faster acting and much more insidious as it causes a madness to take hold that starts as a buzzing in the mind and devolves rapidly into a rabid violence against friend and foe alike. These spores remain active after the death of the alkilith and although they dissipate quickly after exposure to the open air, they can be used to brew a particularly noxious alcohol that can stir even the most serene pacifist to wanton violence.": "就像许多更平凡的霉菌和真菌一样，由于吸入了微小的孢子，alkilith的存在会对生物的健康造成严重破坏。然而，碱石的作用要快得多，也更隐蔽，因为它导致了一种疯狂，开始是头脑中的嗡嗡声，后来迅速演变为对朋友和敌人的狂暴。这些孢子在阿基里斯死后仍然保持活性，尽管它们在暴露于空气中后很快就会消散，但它们可以被用来酿造一种特别有毒的酒精，甚至可以将最宁静的和平主义者煽动成肆意的暴力。",
	"As an action, you may either uncork this vial or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Either way, all creatures within 30 feet of the exposed spores must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw, or hear a faint buzzing in their head and have disadvantage on their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. If the saving throw failed by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the {@spell confusion} spell for 1 minute (no {@condition concentration} required). Once exposed to the open air for one turn, these spores dissipate and become useless.": "作为一个动作，你可以打开这个小瓶，或者把它扔到20英尺远的地方，在撞击时把它摔碎。无论哪种方式，在暴露的孢子周围30英尺范围内的所有生物都必须成功地进行一次{@dc 18}智慧救赎，或者在他们的头脑中听到微弱的嗡嗡声，并在下一次攻击卷、救赎或能力检查中处于劣势。如果蓄力投掷失败了5次或更多，该生物将受到{@spell confusion}法术的影响，持续1分钟（不需要{@condition concentration}）。一旦暴露在空气中一回合，这些孢子就会消散并变得无用。",
	"Alkilith Pus (vial)": "阿基里斯脓液(小瓶)",
	"The oozing innards of an alkilith is its strongest connection to its previous life as an offshoot of the demon prince Jubilex. Composed of foul, unholy miasmas, the alkilith drips fine trails of this pus wherever it goes and is the primary material for transforming an ordinary doorway into a portal to the Abyss. It is very difficult to collect this pus before its magical properties dissipate, but when done so, can also be used as a quick means of Abyssal travel (why you would want to go there however, is beyond me). {@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}": "白石渗出的内脏是它与前世作为恶魔王子朱比莱克斯的分支的最紧密联系。由污秽不洁的瘴气组成，白石所到之处都会滴下细密的脓液，是将普通门洞转化为深渊入口的主要材料。要在这种脓液的魔力消散之前收集它是非常困难的，但如果这样做了，也可以作为一种快速的深渊旅行手段（不过你为什么要去那里，我不知道）。{@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}",
	"If you spread this pus around the sides of an open aperture and leave it undisturbed for 10 minutes, that aperture becomes attuned to the Abyss and transforms into a portal to that realm. The portal becomes anchored to a random unoccupied space in the Abyss, and travelling through the portal transports you and anything you are carrying to that plane as if you were stepping through a doorway. This vial has enough pus to cover 30 feet of perimeter. An aperture's perimeter must be fully enclosed for it to become a portal to the Abyss.": "如果你将这种脓液涂抹在一个开放的孔道两侧，并让它不受干扰10分钟，这个孔道就会与深渊相适应，并转化为一个通往那个领域的门户。这个传送门会被固定在深渊中一个随机的无人空间，通过这个传送门，你和你携带的任何东西都会被传送到那个平面，就像你踏过一个门洞一样。这个小瓶有足够的脓液来覆盖30英尺的周长。一个孔洞的周长必须完全封闭，才能成为通往深渊的入口。",
	"Armanite Hoof (×4)": "阿曼尼特之蹄 (×4)",
	"The armanite does not so much have hooves as it has four ungodly hard hammers on the end of demonically strong legs. Wielding a weapon made of these hooves can feel like unleashing the trample of a warhorse with every swing.": "阿曼尼特与其说是有蹄子，不如说是在恶魔般强壮的双腿末端有四个逆天的硬锤子。挥舞由这些蹄子组成的武器时，感觉就像释放出战马的践踏，每一次挥舞都是如此。",
	"Armanite Claw (×2)": "亚曼石之爪 (×2)",
	"Like many demons, the claws of an armanite are well suited for rending flesh, but little else. When rushing into battle, armanites can often be found raking their claws along their chest to whip themselves into a blood-fueled frenzy before they crash into their foes.": "像许多恶魔一样，阿曼尼特人的爪子很适合撕扯肉体，但其他方面就不太适合了。当冲入战场时，阿曼尼特人经常可以发现他们的爪子沿着他们的胸膛划过，在他们撞向敌人之前，鞭打自己进入血腥的狂热状态。",
	"Armanite Tail": "阿玛尼特尾巴",
	"Like a scythe, the tail of an armanite cuts through swathes of its enemies like they were chaff. Wicked, fearsome, and above all, sharp, a warrior wielding this tail as a weapon is truly one to be feared.": "就像一把镰刀，阿曼尼特人的尾巴像切糠一样切开成片的敌人。邪恶的、可怕的、最重要的是锋利的，以这种尾巴为武器的战士是真正值得敬畏的人。",
	"Armanite Hide": "阿玛尼特藏品",
	"The hide of an armanite is notoriously tough and practically already tanned by the fires of the Abyss. Not only does the leather created from this hide provide a good deal of protection, it is also unseemingly warm regardless of the environment.": "亚玛尼特人的皮是出了名的坚韧，实际上已经被深渊之火所鞣制。用这种皮制作的皮革不仅能提供很好的保护，而且无论在什么环境下，都有令人难以置信的温暖。",
	"As if the archfiends that first designed the armanite thought that they were not yet dangerous enough, the armanite boasts an innate command of lightning in addition to its arsenal of natural weaponry. Those that have witnessed this power can attest to seeing a charge of electricity running down the armanite's mighty horns before it forms a crackling lance in their hand. Indeed, the skull of the armanite is the key to this devastating ability and once hollowed out, it can unlock it for yourself as well.": "仿佛最初设计阿曼尼特的大恶魔认为他们还不够危险，阿曼尼特除了拥有天然的武器库之外，还拥有与生俱来的对闪电的掌控。那些见识过这种力量的人可以证明看到电荷从阿曼尼特强大的角上流下，然后在他们手中形成一把噼里啪啦的长矛。事实上，文石的头骨是这种毁灭性能力的关键，一旦被挖空，它也能为你解锁。",
	"Bulezau Horn (×2)": "布莱索号角 (×2)",
	"Despite their solid appearance, the horns of a bulezau are actually spongiform in nature and are used to cultivate colonies of diseases and other pathogens. Once cleaned however, these horns may be repurposed as a fermentation aid, and in fact there are a few varieties of cheese and alcohol that owe their distinctive spicy flavor to this demonic instrument.": "尽管外观坚固，但布勒索的角实际上是海绵状的，用来培养疾病和其他病原体的菌落。然而，一旦清洗干净，这些角可以被重新用作发酵的辅助工具，事实上，有几个品种的奶酪和酒精的独特辛辣味道归功于这种恶魔般的工具。",
	"Bulezau Boil (×4)": "布莱索沸腾 (×4)",
	"The disease ridden bulezau is covered in a multitude of pulsating boils filled with infected pus. A mere whiff of the miasmas in these boils are enough to ruin the health of any but the hardiest of adventurer and thus must be picked extremely carefully by harvesters. If you can manage to bring them back to an alchemist intact however, they can be brewed into an incredibly deadly tincture.": "疾病缠身的布勒索布满了大量脉动的疖子，里面充满了受感染的脓液。只要闻到这些疖子里的瘴气，就足以毁掉任何一个人的健康，除了最顽强的冒险家，因此收获者必须非常小心地采摘。然而，如果你能设法把它们完好无损地带回给炼金术士，它们可以被酿成一种极其致命的酊剂。",
	"As an action, you may throw this item at a space within 20 feet of you, causing the boils inside to burst on impact. When you do so, all creatures within 30 feet of the item must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 1d6} necrotic damage.": "作为一个动作，你可以将这个物品扔向你20英尺范围内的空间，使里面的疖子在撞击中爆裂。当你这样做时，30英尺范围内的所有生物都必须成功地进行一次{@dc 13}的体质测试，否则会受到{@damage 1d6}的坏死伤害。",
	"Bulezau Tail": "Bulezau Tail",
	"Anyone that has seen a bulezau in action can attest to the terrifying way that its tail flicks and swats at its enemies, spreading a horrifying disease to whomever it hits. This is largely attributable to the spines on the tail which are not only sharp, but are also hollow and filled with infectious contagions. With a few alchemical alterations however, these spines can be repurposed to actually draw diseases out of the user (so long as they can put up with the pain, that is).": "任何看过布勒索行动的人都可以证明，它的尾巴在敌人身上甩来甩去，将可怕的疾病传播给它所击中的人。这主要归功于尾巴上的刺，这些刺不仅锋利，而且是空心的，充满了传染性的传染病。然而，通过一些炼金术的改造，这些刺可以被重新利用，实际上是把疾病从使用者身上引出来（只要他们能忍受痛苦，就是这样）。",
	"The chaotic energy that constitutes the ethereal form of a dybbuk is notoriously difficult to pin down and must be done very quickly before is dissipates back into the Abyss. That same chaotic energy however, makes it very versatile and some tinkers have been known to use it as an animating force for their constructions, saying that it gives their creations a more lifelike spontaneity. {@b Requires {@item spirit paper|HHHVI}.}": "构成戴比克空灵形态的混沌能量是出了名的难以捉摸，必须在它消散回深渊之前迅速完成。然而，同样的混沌能量使它具有很强的通用性，一些工匠已经知道用它作为他们建筑的动力，说它给他们的作品带来更多栩栩如生的自发性。{@b Requires {@item spirit paper|HHHVI}.}",

	"Maurezhi Blood (3 vials)": "毛瑞希的血（3瓶）",
	"This black, tar-like substance resembles the coagulated blood found on murdered corpses. If you have the stomach for it, it can be rubbed on one's body to mask the presence radiated by all living beings that the undead can detect.": "这种黑色的焦油状物质类似于被谋杀的尸体上发现的凝固的血液。如果你有胃口，可以把它抹在身上，以掩盖所有活人所散发的、亡灵所能察觉的存在。",
	"You may spend 1 minute to cover yourself in this blood. If you do so, undead creatures with an Intelligence of less than 10 have disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks to find you.

	"The claws of the ghoul-like creatures are well known for their paralyzing touch, and there are many a horror story of adventurers devoured alive by these abominations while they could do nothing but lie there helpless (of course one has to wonder how this story could be true if they are alive to tell it, but I digress).": "这种类似食尸鬼的生物的爪子以其麻痹的触感而闻名，有许多关于冒险者被这些可憎的东西活活吞噬的恐怖故事，而他们只能无助地躺在那里（当然，人们不得不怀疑，如果他们还活着讲述，这个故事怎么可能是真的，但我想说的是）。",
	"Maurezhi Hide": "毛泽东藏书楼",
	"Despite its undead nature, a maurezhi does not rot or decompose. While this only adds to its unnerving nature, its skin does have certain properties useful for a harvester. Some of the original designs for the renowned bag of colding used maurezhi hide as its main material.": "尽管它具有不死的性质，但毛利人不会腐烂或分解。虽然这只是增加了它令人不安的性质，但它的皮肤确实具有对收割机有用的某些特性。著名的寒冰袋的一些原始设计使用毛利人的皮作为主要材料。",
	"Maurezhi Fang (×2)": "毛泽东方 (×2)",
	"As the \"lieutenant\" of ghouls, the maurezhi has the dubious gift of being able to convert its prey into a new {@creature ghoul|MM} to serve it. It does so by using its fangs to literally sap away a creature's will and individuality. I have seen compatriots and hirelings die in more ways than I can count, but I can honestly say that there is nothing more chilling than watching a person's very identity fade away as a ravenous demon drains the very identity out of them.": "作为食尸鬼的 \"副手\"，莫雷兹具有可疑的天赋，能够将它的猎物转化为新的（%0%）来为它服务。它通过使用它的獠牙来吸走生物的意志和个性来做到这一点。我见过的同胞和雇工的死法多得数不清，但我可以坦率地说，没有什么比看着一个人的身份随着贪婪的恶魔抽走他们的身份而消逝更令人心寒的了。",
	"Abyssal Weapon Ichor (6 vials)": "深渊兵器的焦味（6瓶）",
	"It is the nightmare of every crusading adventurer to slay a powerful foe, only to find their hard won loot disappear before their very eyes. Such is the case with the molydeus, who in a final act of spite to its enemies, causes its weapon to dissolve into a thick ichor upon its death. Although this was intended as a safeguard by the demon lords, they did not anticipate the resourcefulness of a harvester armed with this book! Simply scoop up some of that ichor into an {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI} and bring it back to a very skilled alchemist to create a weapon oil that will add a demonic lethality to your strikes. {@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}": "杀死一个强大的敌人，却发现他们辛苦得来的战利品在他们眼前消失，这是每个十字军冒险家的噩梦。莫里德斯就是这种情况，作为对敌人的最后报复，它的武器在死后会化为浓浓的血腥味。尽管恶魔领主打算将此作为一种保护措施，但他们没有预料到拿着这本书的收割者的足智多谋! 只需舀起一些ichor放入一个{@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}，带回给一个非常熟练的炼金术士，就可以制造出一种武器油，为你的攻击增加恶魔般的杀伤力。{@b Requires {@item enchanted vial|HHHVI}.}",
	"Molydeus Snake Head": "蛇头Molydeus",
	"The molydeus snake head has an inherent connection to the demon lord that molded the molydeus and acts as both an advisor and supervisor to the mighty fiend. Aside from that, they also possess a potent venom that corrupts the very lifeforce of a creature and over time, transforms them into a demon themselves. It takes a powerful thaumaturge to tame the demonic connection inside the head, but if managed, it can allow the wielder to channel the strength of the demon lords themselves.": "莫利德斯蛇头与塑造莫利德斯的恶魔领主有着内在的联系，它既是这个强大恶魔的顾问，又是其监督者。除此之外，他们还拥有一种强大的毒液，可以腐蚀生物的生命力，并随着时间的推移，将他们自己转化为恶魔。需要一个强大的巫师来驯服头脑中的恶魔联系，但如果得到管理，它可以让施法者自己引导恶魔领主的力量。",
	"Molydeus Wolf Head": "莫利德斯狼头",
	"The main head of the molydeus resembles that of a savage wolf, with teeth sharper than daggers and a constant rabid gleam in their eyes. It is believed that these wolf heads are actually themselves harvested in the Abyss by trapping dozens of starved wolves in a pit and having them tear each other to shreds in a cannibalistic frenzy; the last one alive has the dubious honor of becoming a part of the new molydeus.": "莫利德斯的主要头部类似于野蛮的狼，牙齿比匕首还要锋利，眼睛里一直闪烁着狂热的光芒。人们认为，这些狼头实际上是自己在深渊中收获的，方法是将几十只饥饿的狼困在一个坑里，让它们在食人狂潮中互相撕咬，最后一个活着的狼有一个可疑的荣誉，那就是成为新的莫利德斯的一部分。",
	"Demon Lord's Authority": "恶魔之主的权力",
	"Much like a well-trusted valet, the existence of a molydeus is one of both servitude and authority. While they must obey their demon lord's every whim, they are also feared as carrying the voice of their master everywhere they go and as such, they are one of the few beings in existence that can inspire fear in a demon. This fear creates a gestalt field around the molydeus that in turn inspires more obsequience from lesser demons in a self-perpetuating cycle.

	"Nabassu Claw (×2)": "娜巴苏之爪 (×2)",
	"Black-tipped and able to rend both flesh and spirit, the nabassu claw is one of the most perfect natural weapons formed within the Abyss. It is said that weaponry formed from these claws quiver with excitement in the hands of their wielder as they prepare to take a mortal life.": "纳巴苏爪子是深渊中形成的最完美的天然武器之一，它有黑色的尖端，能够撕裂肉体和精神。据说，由这些爪子形成的武器在持剑者手中兴奋地颤抖，因为他们准备夺取一个凡人的生命。",
	"Demon Wing (×2)": "恶魔之翼 (×2)",
	"Like many fiends, the dark wings of the nabassu possess an inherent magic that holds its form aloft instead of relying on physical forces. And, like many fiends, these wings can be harvested to form the basis of the ever-useful: {@item infernal wings|HHHVI}.": "像许多恶魔一样，纳巴苏的黑暗之翼拥有一种内在的魔力，可以使它的形态高高在上，而不是依靠物理力量。而且，和许多魔族一样，这些翅膀可以被收割，形成永远有用的基础：（%0%）。",
	"Nabassu Hide": "纳巴苏隐藏",
	"The hide of a nabassu is as dark as a moonless night and tougher than castleforged steel. Not only that, but it is capable of emitting a demonic aura around itself that literally smothers the light around it, allowing the nabassu to shroud itself constantly in a cloak of shadows. This has led to many tales of legendary thieves that ascribe their supernatural stealth to suits of pitch black nabassu hide.": "纳巴苏的皮就像无月的夜晚一样黑，比城堡里的钢铁还要坚硬。不仅如此，它还能在自己周围散发出一种恶魔般的光环，简直可以把周围的光线熏得一干二净，让纳巴苏不断地把自己笼罩在阴影的阴影中。这导致了许多关于传说中的盗贼的故事，他们将自己超自然的隐身能力归功于漆黑的纳巴苏皮。",
	"If there is one thing that a nabassu is famous for, it is their devouring of mortal souls. Such a terrible action requires a very specific set of adaptations, and the jaw of the nabassu can be found to be lined with tiny Abyssal runes that disintegrate any spiritual form that enters them.": "如果说nabassu有什么出名的地方，那就是他们对凡人灵魂的吞噬。这样一个可怕的行动需要一套非常特殊的适应性，可以发现纳巴苏的下巴上有微小的深渊符文，可以瓦解任何进入它们的精神形态。",
	"Nabassu Eye (×2)": "纳巴苏之眼 (×2)",
	"Beyond its razor sharp claws and fangs, the most dangerous body part of a nabassu is in fact its eyes. These glowing orbs are capable of stealing the soul of whomever they gaze upon and in fact are said to be the inspiration for the infamous soul gems used by demiliches to protect their lairs.": "除了锋利的爪子和獠牙，纳巴苏最危险的身体部位实际上是它的眼睛。这些发光的眼球能够窃取它们所凝视的人的灵魂，事实上，据说这也是恶魔用来保护其巢穴的臭名昭著的灵魂宝石的灵感来源。",
	"The oozing, festering skin of the beleaguered rutterkin is covered in all times by a myriad of pustules. They smell worse than they look, but this in turn provides them some measure of utility as an animal repellant. Their unholy odor is anathema to most mundane beasts, and desperate farmers have been known to line their fields with the ichor inside to protect their crops.": "陷入困境的拉特金的渗出、溃烂的皮肤在任何时候都被无数的脓包所覆盖。他们的气味比他们的外表更糟糕，但这反过来又为他们提供了某种程度的实用性，作为一种动物驱赶剂。它们不祥的气味让大多数世俗的野兽感到厌恶，而绝望的农民已经知道用里面的ichor来保护他们的庄稼。",
	"Rutterkin Bile (vial)": "鲁特金胆汁(小瓶)",
	"Although they are not the strongest of all demons, a single rutterkin can make even the bravest adventurer fear for their safety. This is due to the rutterkin's bile which possesses an insidious poison that transforms and mutates the mortally wounded into a horrid abyssal wretch. I have been unfortunate enough to witness more than one mighty companion laid low by the surprise bite of a rutterkin, forcing me to do my duty and end their new pitiful existence. Although this bile loses potency after the death of the rutterkin, it still maintains some utility as a poison.": "虽然他们不是所有恶魔中最强壮的，但一个拉特金就能让最勇敢的冒险者为他们的安全而担忧。这是由于拉特金的胆汁拥有一种阴险的毒药，它能将受了致命伤的人变成可怕的深渊恶棍。我已经不幸地目睹了不止一个强大的同伴被拉特金突如其来的一口咬死，迫使我履行我的职责，结束他们新的可怜的存在。虽然这种胆汁在拉特金死后会失去效力，但它作为一种毒药仍然保持一定的效用。",
	"As an action, you may coat one piercing or slashing melee weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition with this bile. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw against disease or become {@condition poisoned}.

	"Rutterkin Tentacle": "鲁特金触角",
	"In their mad mutations, the rutterkin have developed an auxiliary mouth located, bizarrely, on a long tentacle where one of their arms should be. While this tentacle may be gruesome, the fact that it is somewhat self-aware makes it a boon for tinkers who have managed to convert it into a rather macabre toy.": "在他们疯狂的变异中，拉特金人已经开发出了一个辅助的嘴巴，奇怪的是，它位于一个长的触手上，而他们的一只胳膊应该在这里。虽然这个触手可能很可怕，但它有点自我意识的事实使它成为工匠们的福音，他们设法将其转化为相当可怕的玩具。",
	"Much like their rutterkin progenitors, an abyssal wretch is constantly covered in open sores, wounds, and pustules. However, unlike the rutterkin, these pustules do not emit a completely horrid stench when popped; they merely emit a somewhat horrid stench at all times. As such, some demonic cults have taken to using them as a twisted incense when performing their rituals. That said, this practice has largely fallen out of favor, since the lingering stench makes the cults extremely easy to find and identify.": "和他们的拉特金祖先一样，一个深渊的可怜虫经常被开放的疮、伤口和脓包所覆盖。然而，与鲁特金不同，这些脓包在爆裂时不会发出完全可怕的臭味；它们只是在任何时候都会发出一种有点可怕的臭味。因此，一些恶魔教派在举行仪式时把它们当作一种扭曲的香火。尽管如此，这种做法在很大程度上已经不受欢迎了，因为挥之不去的恶臭使这些邪教组织非常容易被发现和识别。",
	"The undulating form of the sibriex is covered in oozing cysts that seep with all manner of demonic bodily fluid. Harvesting these is disgusting, to say the least, but they serve an important aspect in arcane academia. Due to the sibriex's natural affinity for transmutation, every aspect of its form provides a fascinating research material for those studying the arts of transfiguration and thus can fetch a fair bit of coin on the open market. Some wizards even go so far as to transform parts of a sibriex into their trademark transmuter stone, claiming that it allows them to shape the bodies of those around them more easily.": "西伯利亚人起伏不定的身体上布满了渗出的囊肿，渗出的是各种恶魔的体液。至少可以说，收获这些东西是令人厌恶的，但它们在奥秘的学术界有一个重要的作用。由于西伯利亚人对转化的天然亲和力，其形态的每一个方面都为研究转化艺术的人提供了迷人的研究材料，因此在公开市场上可以卖出相当多的钱。一些巫师甚至将西伯利亚克斯的一部分转化为他们标志性的转化石，声称这可以让他们更容易地塑造周围人的身体。",
	"Sibriex Bile (6 vials)": "Sibriex Bile (6瓶)",
	"Befitting of the way that a sibriex views flesh as nothing more than malleable material to be played with, the bile that constantly spills from its mouth is highly acidic and capable of dissolving large chunks of organic material in mere seconds. It is easy enough to keep this acid in a vial to be thrown as a crude yet effective bomb, but taking it to an alchemist can allow you to brew a more stable version to coat your weapon to deadly ends.": "与西伯利亚人视肉体为可塑之物的方式相称，从它嘴里不断溢出的胆汁是高度酸性的，能够在短短几秒钟内溶解大块的有机物质。把这种酸液装在小瓶里，作为一个粗糙但有效的炸弹扔出去是很容易的，但把它交给炼金术士可以让你酿造出更稳定的版本，以涂抹在你的武器上达到致命的目的。",
	"As an action, you may make a ranged attack by throwing this vial at a target within 20 feet of you, treating the vial as an improvised {@homebrew weapon|object}.

On a miss, the vial shatters on the ground and is wasted.": "作为一个动作，你可以向20英尺内的目标投掷这个小瓶，进行一次远程攻击，将小瓶视为一个简易的（%0%）。如果成功命中，小瓶会在撞击中碎裂，并对目标造成{@damage 4d6}的酸液伤害。如果没有命中，小瓶会在地面上碎裂并被浪费掉。",
	"Sibriex Miasma (4 vials)": "Sibriex Miasma (4小瓶)",
	"The sibriex is constantly surrounded by a pool of thick miasma that instantly sickens any living thing it reaches. More than simple pollution, this contamination rots and destroys a creature's very lifeforce and is inherently magical in nature. It is a dangerous substance to work with, but a skilled alchemist can take this miasma and use it to create a potion that transfigures the drinker's blood into a poison to kill their enemies (while leaving the drinker unharmed, of course).": "西伯利亚人一直被一池浓稠的瘴气所包围，它能立即使任何生物生病。这种污染不仅仅是简单的污染，它还会腐烂和破坏生物的生命力，并且在本质上具有魔力。这是一种危险的物质，但熟练的炼金术士可以利用这种瘴气制造一种药水，将饮用者的血液转化为杀死敌人的毒药（当然，饮用者不会受到伤害）。",
	"Sibriex Frontal Cortex": "西伯利亚额叶皮层",
	"In the depraved creativity of the sibriex, there lurks only monsters, demons, and nightmares. Indeed, if one dissects the deformed cranium of a sibriex, they will find a severely misshaped frontal lobe that is literally the twisted mind that creates such abominations. This lobe is brimming with transmutation magic and can become a very powerful amulet once it has gone through the hands of a knowledgeable artificer.": "在西伯利亚人堕落的创造力中，只潜伏着怪物、恶魔和恶梦。事实上，如果人们解剖一个西伯利亚人的畸形头颅，就会发现一个形状严重错误的额叶，这简直就是创造这种可憎现象的扭曲的头脑。这个叶子充满了转化的魔力，一旦经过知识渊博的工匠之手，它就能成为一个非常强大的护身符。",
	"Like a piranha, the mouth of a wastrilith is lined with row after row of thin, pointy teeth. Unlike piranha teeth however, wastrilith fangs contain a hair-like structure reminiscent of a whale's baleen. It is believed that this helps the wastrilith to filter through substances as it swims in its own polluted domains and then use what it collects to supply its own reserve of contaminants. As such, these teeth can actually be used as a filtration system, and have been known to be able to sieve through even magically tainted water sources.": "像食人鱼一样，黄石鱼的嘴里有一排又一排细而尖的牙齿。然而，与食人鱼的牙齿不同，黄石鱼的獠牙含有一种毛发状的结构，让人想起鲸鱼的鲸须。据认为，这有助于黄石鱼在自己的污染领域中游动时过滤物质，然后用它收集的东西来供应自己的污染物储备。因此，这些牙齿实际上可以作为一个过滤系统，并且已经知道能够筛除甚至是被魔法污染的水源。",
	"Wastrilith Claw (×2)": "瓦斯蒂利特之爪 (×2)",
	"Shaped like giant fishing hooks, the wastrilith's claws are capable of dragging adventurers down into the furthest depths of its watery domain. Formed from a lightweight but surprisingly strong cartilage, these claws make a very powerful yet easily handled weapon.": "黄石的爪子形状像巨大的鱼钩，能够将冒险者拖入其水域的最深处。这些爪子由轻质但出奇坚固的软骨形成，是一种非常强大但容易处理的武器。",
	"Wastrilith Scales (large bag)": "Wastrilith天平（大袋）。",
	"The scales of a wastrilith constantly ooze with a viscous mucus that is largely responsible for their infamous water corrupting ability. They are also incredibly hard and are comparable to the shells of dragon turtles in their durability. A suit of armor crafted from these scales allows an adventurer to sport the demonic protection of the wastrilith, but I would recommend wearing a thick doublet under it, unless you enjoy the feeling of slimy scales on your skin at all times.": "黄石的鳞片上不断渗出粘稠的粘液，这在很大程度上是它们臭名昭著的水腐蚀能力的原因。它们也非常坚硬，其耐用性可与龙龟的壳相媲美。用这些鳞片制作的盔甲可以让冒险者拥有恶魔般的保护，但我建议在盔甲下穿一件厚厚的外套，除非你喜欢皮肤上黏糊糊的鳞片的感觉。",
	"Wastrilith Bladder": "瓦斯利特膀胱",
	"Located inside the throat of the wastrilith is a watermelon-sized bladder that it uses to launch concentrated bursts of water at its foes. This organ is more than a mundane sack however, as it is also magical in nature; it is what grants the wastrilith its infernal control over the water around it. The bladder is delicate and easily damaged on removal, but a well-preserved sample can be used as a powerful magical item.": "位于wastrilith喉咙里的是一个西瓜大小的膀胱，它用来向它的敌人发射集中的水爆弹。然而，这个器官不仅仅是一个平凡的袋子，因为它在本质上也是有魔力的；正是它赋予了黄石对它周围的水以地狱般的控制。膀胱很脆弱，取出后很容易损坏，但保存完好的样本可以作为一个强大的魔法物品使用。",

	"One tale that I have heard whispered from the mouth of a dying cultist, was that {@creature Baphomet|MTF} was not always a demon. In fact, Baphomet was once a fabled ranger known as \"the King of Hunters.\" The King of Hunters was so skilled that he boasted even the gods themselves could not create a prey he could not kill. Angered by his arrogance, they set him a challenge: they would release the largest, wildest stag into a maddening maze, and he would not be permitted to leave until he had tracked and killed this divine quarry. He agreed to their terms and ventured into the maze, the gods waiting smugly by the entrance to listen for the signs of his failure. For five days, there was no sign of his return and the gods grew confident in their victory over this mere mortal. On the sixth day however, the King of Hunters limped into view, the bleeding head of the massive stag over his shoulders. Throwing it at the feet of the gods, the King of Hunters mocked them for their pathetic challenge and the supposedly weak creature they had created. Furious at both his victory and his scorn, the gods struck him down with a curse; removing his head and replacing it with that of the stag he had just slain. The anger he felt at their treachery transformed him into a demon and he was thrown into the Abyss where the gods would no longer have to face him again. From his new domain, the King of Hunters, renamed himself Baphomet, the Horned King, and subdue scores of demons under his control until he became a feared Demon Lord. Today, he waits for the chance to use his horns to gore the very gods that created them; as they are his ultimate quarry and he is their hunter.": "我从一个濒临死亡的邪教徒口中听到的一个故事是，{@creature Baphomet|MTF}并不总是一个恶魔。事实上，巴弗灭曾经是一个传说中的游侠，被称为 \"猎手之王\"。猎手之王是如此的熟练，以至于他吹嘘即使是诸神本身也无法创造出他无法杀死的猎物。他的傲慢激怒了他们，他们向他提出了一个挑战：他们将把最大、最野的雄鹿放进一个令人发狂的迷宫，在他追踪并杀死这个神圣的猎物之前，他将不被允许离开。他同意了他们的条件，冒险进入迷宫，众神在入口处得意地等待着，倾听他失败的迹象。五天来，他没有回来的迹象，众神对他们战胜这个凡人的信心大增。然而，在第六天，狩猎者之王一瘸一拐地走进了人们的视线，巨大的雄鹿的血淋淋的头颅在他肩上。猎手之王把它扔在众神的脚下，嘲笑他们可悲的挑战和他们创造的所谓弱小生物。诸神对他的胜利和他的蔑视都很愤怒，用诅咒将他打倒在地；摘下他的头，换上他刚刚杀死的雄鹿的头。他对他们的背叛所感到的愤怒使他变成了一个恶魔，他被扔进了深渊，在那里诸神将不再需要面对他。在他的新领域里，猎人之王给自己改名为巴弗灭，有角的国王，并在他的控制下制服了几十个恶魔，直到他成为令人敬畏的恶魔之王。今天，他在等待机会，用他的角去刺杀创造他们的神；因为他们是他最终的猎物，而他是他们的猎人。",
	"Demogorgon's Spine": "德莫吉恩的脊柱",
	"The mysterious Y-shaped symbol of Demogorgon that drives all who gaze upon it mad is said to be representative of their spine that branches into two in order to support their dual heads.

It is completely unknown if this is what the demon lord originally looked like or if this is merely another result of their many arcane mutations and foul alterations. There are legends however that this face is actually the only remnant of the creature that Fraz-Urb'luu used to be. The tale recounts how a mortal trickster descended into Hollow Heart and entered into a game of wits with that domain's previous master. So clever and cunning was this trickster, that they managed to deceive this master into cutting off their own head. Then, with little remorse or hesitation, the trickster cut off their own and let their dark influence reattach it to the gargoyle-like body of their vanquished foe. The creature that rose was the newly born Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception and master of Hollow Heart.": "在正常状态下，Fraz-Urb'luu的头部类似于一个妖怪，带着微笑的、类似人类的面孔。我们完全不知道这是否是恶魔领主最初的模样，或者这只是他们许多神秘的变异和肮脏的改变的另一个结果。然而，有传说说这张脸实际上是弗雷兹-乌尔布鲁曾经的生物的唯一遗留物。这个故事讲述了一个凡人骗子如何进入空心城，并与该领域的前任主人进行了一场智力游戏。这个骗子如此聪明和狡猾，以至于他们成功地欺骗了这位主人，使其砍下了自己的头。然后，这个诡计多端的人几乎没有任何悔意或犹豫，砍下了自己的头，并让他们的黑暗影响将其重新连接到他们被征服的敌人的巨妖般的身体上。崛起的生物是新诞生的弗雷兹-乌尔布卢，欺骗王子和空心大师。",
	"Graz'zt's Heart": "格拉兹兹特的心",
	"Unlike his beautiful countenance, the heart of Graz'zt is a hideous, shrunken, and shrivelled thing to behold. Graz'zt has neglected all genuine emotions of happiness and love in exachange for indulding in mindless sensual pleasures. This has led to the atrophied condition of his heart, within which is contained the many corruptions and hedonistic acts he has ever committed. The sheer concentration of these depravities make the organ a powerful conduit for particularly foul magic.": "与他美丽的外表不同，格拉兹兹特的心是一个可怕的、萎缩的、干瘪的东西，可以看到。格拉兹兹特忽略了所有真正的幸福和爱的情感，以换取沉溺于无意识的感官享受。这导致了他心脏的萎缩状态，其中包含了他曾经犯下的许多腐败和享乐主义行为。这些堕落行为的纯粹集中，使这个器官成为一个强大的渠道，可以施展特别肮脏的魔法。",
	"Juiblex Mote": "聚宝斋",
	"Juiblex's origin is a hot topic for debate among demonologists. Some contend that it rose from the remains of a melted ancient evil, others say that it was a mass convergence of lesser oozes that created a terrifying hivemind, while some simply believe that it sprung forth as a globule of the Elemental Chaos itself. Regardless of which theory is correct, it is commonly agreed that despite Juiblex's constantly dripping and regenerating form, there is one mote inside of it that holds the totality of its essence. It is within this mote that the Demon Lord's power comes fully realised and can be extracted for extremely powerful and foul magics.": "Juiblex的起源是恶魔学家们争论的热门话题。有些人认为它是从一个融化的古代恶魔的残骸中升起的，另一些人说它是一个较小的ozes的大规模聚合，创造了一个可怕的蜂巢，而有些人则简单地认为它是作为混沌元素本身的一个球体涌现出来的。无论哪种理论是正确的，人们普遍认为，尽管尤里布勒克斯不断地滴落和再生，但它的内部有一个微子，拥有其全部的本质。正是在这个微尘中，恶魔领主的力量得到了充分的体现，并且可以被提取出来用于极其强大和肮脏的魔法。",

	"As befitting of his monstrous love for reusing the bodies of the dead to bolster his own strength, the body of Orcus is actually made from the corpses of the strongest enemies he slew on the path to power. In particular are his massive bat-like wings that most believe he took from a defeated balor, ripping them off the living demon's body before it could immolate itself in death. As one of his first grabs for true dominance in the Abyss, these wings have been with Orcus for countless ages and have grown in strength with him, infused with all his corrupted majesty and influence.": "为了迎合他对重用死者尸体以增强自身力量的畸形爱好，奥库斯的身体实际上是由他在权力之路上杀死的最强大敌人的尸体制成的。特别是他那巨大的蝙蝠般的翅膀，大多数人认为他是从一个被打败的巴洛尔身上取下来的，在它死前把它们从活的恶魔身上扯下来。作为他第一次在深渊中争夺真正的统治权，这对翅膀已经伴随着奥库斯度过了无数个时代，并随着他的力量不断增长，注入了他所有腐朽的威严和影响力。",

	"Twin Horns of Bael": "贝勒的双角",
	"The horns of Bael are actually relatively understated for something that adorns the head of one of the Nine Hells' most dangerous inhabitants. Ridged cones that resemble that of a massive steer, these horns actually contain most of the archdevils' strength.

	"Zariel is truly a tragic figure. Once a proud and majestic angel, Zariel fell from grace and now serves Asmodeus as another archdevil in the Nine Hells. The only aspect of her celestial heritage that she still possesses are her mighty wings, but even they have become corrupted into infernos of blazing hellfire that constantly stream from her back.

	"If a creature drinks this vial of this blood, for the next hour that creature automatically fails any saving throw against any effect that would result in them becoming {@condition charmed}. This blood is tasteless and odorless once added to any other liquid, but retains its dark-red coloring.": "如果一个生物喝了这瓶血，在接下来的一个小时里，该生物对任何会导致他们变得（%0%）的效果的拯救动作都会自动失败。这种血一旦加入任何其他液体中就会变得无味和无臭，但会保留其暗红色的颜色。",
	"Summer Blood (3 vials)": "夏日之血 (3小瓶)",
	"The blood of an eladrin in its summer form smells like cinnamon and seems to remain warm and fluid even long after the death of its original owner. Creatures of the Feywild that pledge themselves to the eladrin have been found wearing war paint that has been made from pigments and droplets of summer blood which is said to enhance the aggression and combat ability of the user.": "夏天形态的艾拉德林的血闻起来像肉桂，即使在它原来的主人死后很久，似乎还能保持温暖和流动。誓死效忠于艾拉德林的仙界生物被发现涂上了由颜料和夏日之血滴组成的战争颜料，据说可以增强使用者的攻击性和战斗力。",

	"Regardless of their end form, the creation of an elder elemental is an event so momentous that it breaks reality itself for a brief moment. This leads to the creation of an entropy shard: a piece of reality inside every elder elemental that they retain from their multiverse-shattering births.

	"Leviathan Drop": "利维坦坠落",
	"In its ever flowing form, it may seem like the leviathan has no easily defined form that would make for any sensible harvesting. The people that believe this, however, are not as competent as I. Indeed, for the harvester that is both perceptive and daring, there is a treasure at the center of a leviathan known as its \"drop\". This fist-sized drop seems like any of the water around it, yet if one looks carefully, they will notice that it never actually loses its shape or mixes with anything else in the leviathan, almost as if a strong, invisible membrane keeps it all in place. This drop, in fact, contains the essence of the leviathan and is as useful for channeling its power as a heart would be in a normal creature. For this reason, the drop is incredibly valuable as a reagent and only the most skilled alchemists have the knowledge and privilege of working with it.": "在其不断流动的形式中，似乎利维坦没有一个容易定义的形式，可以进行任何明智的收获。事实上，对于那些既敏锐又大胆的收割者来说，在利维坦的中心有一个被称为 \"水滴 \"的宝藏。这个拳头大小的水滴似乎与周围的任何水都一样，但如果仔细观察，他们会注意到它实际上从未失去形状或与利维坦中的其他东西混合在一起，几乎就像一个强大的、无形的薄膜将其保持在原位。事实上，这滴水包含了利维坦的精华，对于引导它的力量来说，就像普通生物的心脏一样有用。由于这个原因，这滴水作为一种试剂是非常有价值的，只有最熟练的炼金术士才有知识和特权来使用它。",
	"Phoenix Ashes (small pouch)": "凤凰灰（小袋装）",
	"As a phoenix reaches the end of its current life, it bursts into a fiery nova that consumes its body entirely, allowing it to be reborn inside the cinder-egg and restore its strength. Although the cinder-egg tends to constitute whatever is left of the phoenix's material form, you may be able to gather some remnant ashes that contain traces of the phoenix's legendary regenerative power. When a skilled blacksmith adds these ashes to their furnace, they are able to create a legendary suit of armor that grants the user the same eternal presence as the phoenix itself.": "当凤凰到达它当前生命的终点时，它会爆发出炽热的新星，将它的身体完全吞噬，让它在煤渣蛋里重生，恢复它的力量。虽然煤渣蛋往往构成了凤凰物质形态的任何遗留物，但你可能会收集到一些残余的灰烬，其中含有凤凰传奇性的再生能力的痕迹。当一个熟练的铁匠将这些灰烬加入他们的熔炉时，他们能够制造出一套传奇的盔甲，赋予使用者与凤凰本身一样的永恒存在。",
	"Elder Tempest Spark (vial)": "长老风暴火花（小瓶）",
	"The elder tempest represents nature at its most dangerous and mercurial. However, within the constantly shifting form one thing remains constant: a crackling bolt of lightning that moves like a snake inside the gale of hurricane winds. This spark acts like the \"spine\" of the tempest, and can be thought of as the core of its being.

	"Zaratan Rubble (large bag)": "扎拉坦碎石（大袋）。",
	"Although the zaratan may seem like the definition of inactivity and dormancy, those that have met one can attest to the constant rumbling that occurs from it at all times, as if a great activity takes place within its shell. This is due to the unique, living minerals that constitutes the zaratan's body and defy the laws of physics by acting as force multipliers for everything around them. The result is a constant shifting of the rocks inside its form, like a circulatory system built from an avalanche. If you can find these special pieces of rubble after the zaratan's death, an artificer with expertise in elemental magic can harness it to create a weapon that contains literally limitless power.": "虽然Zaratan看起来像是不活动和休眠的定义，但那些见过Zaratan的人可以证明，它在任何时候都会发出持续的隆隆声，就像在它的外壳里发生了巨大的活动。这是由于构成Zaratan身体的独特的、活的矿物，通过对周围的一切起到力的倍增作用而违背了物理学规律。其结果是在其形态内的岩石不断移位，就像由雪崩建立的循环系统。如果你能在扎拉坦死后找到这些特殊的碎石，具有元素魔法专长的工匠就能利用它创造出一种武器，而这种武器简直包含无限的力量。",

	"Elementals are, by their nature, free and chaotic beings. It usually takes a lot of effort and powerful magic to trap them into a single form, and even more to bind them into service like one does with an elemental myrmidon. In fact, this magic is so strong, that it becomes reflected in the physical form of the elemental itself in the form of shackle-like armor around their wrists. These shackles have a number of uses due to the elemental magic infused into them, including reuse as binders for more elemental servants.": "从本质上讲，元素是自由而混乱的生命。通常需要大量的努力和强大的魔法才能将他们困在一个单一的形式中，甚至更多的是像元素使者那样将他们捆绑起来为其服务。事实上，这种魔法是如此强大，以至于它反映在元素本身的物理形态上，在他们的手腕上形成了枷锁般的盔甲。由于注入了元素魔法，这些镣铐有许多用途，包括作为更多元素仆人的粘合剂重新使用。",
	"As a ranged attack, you may throw these shackles at an elemental that is size Large or smaller within 20 feet of you. On a successful hit, that elemental must make a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw.

While {@condition charmed} in this way, the elemental must obey your verbal commands to the best of its ability. If you do not issue any verbal commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

Once the elemental is no longer {@condition charmed}, the shackles slip off them and may not be used again until the next dawn.": "作为一个范围攻击，你可以将这些镣铐扔向你20英尺范围内体型较大或较小的元素体。在成功击中后，该元素必须做一个{@dc 15}智慧救赎动作。如果成功，镣铐就会断裂并变得无用。如果失败，镣铐就会与元素的形态结合在一起，并且该元素会在1小时内被你变成（%1%）。当{@condition charmed}以这种方式存在时，元素必须尽其所能地服从你的口头命令。如果你没有向它发出任何口头命令，它就会防御敌对的生物，但除此之外不采取任何行动。如果你或你的同伴伤害了元素体，它可以再次进行蓄力投掷，如果成功则结束魅惑。一旦元素不再是{@condition charmed}，镣铐就会从它们身上滑落，直到下一个黎明才可以再次使用。",

In fact, one common task for young drow is to form hunting packs to harvest kruthik spikes; hopefully collecting more arrow material than they use.": "作为一种天然的武器，Kruthiks可以像箭一样从腿上发射甲壳素的碎片，以不可思议的精确度将猎物串起来。在木材稀少的暗黑世界里，这些轻巧而耐用的尖刺是珍贵的箭托，而且用它们装满鸦人的箭筒也是很常见的。事实上，年轻的乌鸦的一项常见任务是组成狩猎队去收割克鲁西克的尖刺；希望能收集到比他们使用的更多的箭矢材料。",
	"Kruthik Hive Lord Chitin": "克鲁西克蜂巢领主奇廷",
	"A kruthik hive lord is immensely durable due to being covered in a thick chitin shell that is stronger than most plate. It is usually pretty easy to spot a commander of an Underdark brigade of warriors, since they are often adorned in intimidating, spikey armor crafted from this chitin.": "Kruthik蜂巢领主非常耐用，因为它被一层厚厚的甲壳所覆盖，比大多数板材还要坚固。通常很容易发现地下城战士大队的指挥官，因为他们经常穿着用这种甲壳素制作的令人生畏的尖头盔甲。",
	"Sigil Oil (5 vials)": "圣母油（5瓶）",
	"The oil that flows through the marut is no simple lubricant found on a cheap tinker's toy. It is believed that this oil is refined from the drippings of Primus himself, their oil giving life to their greatest creation. This oil is highly coveted by mortal crafters to use when making their own constructs as it is believed that they lend a more lifelike quality to their creation's movements.": "流经Marut的油不是廉价工匠玩具上的简单润滑剂。人们相信，这种油是从普利姆斯本人的滴液中提炼出来的，他们的油给了他们最伟大的创造物以生命。这种油是凡人工匠在制造他们自己的构造物时非常垂涎的，因为人们相信它们会给他们的创造物的运动带来更逼真的质量。",

	"Forged with mechanical precision under hammers timed to the eternally ticking gears of Mechanus, the hands of a marut are as close to godly perfection as can be achieved in the metallic form. Capable of striking down even fiendish lords and celestial beings in service of the marut's goal of enforcing the law, these hands are almost impossible to work with for a mortal crafter. Yet, for the rare individual that can, a truly remarkable set of gauntlets can be created, one that can turn even mortals into executioners of the gods.": "在锤子的作用下，Marut的手被精确地锻造成了机械，与Mechanus永恒的齿轮同步，Marut的手在金属形态上可以说是接近于神的完美。为了实现Marut执行法律的目标，这双手甚至可以击倒恶魔般的领主和天人，对于凡人工匠来说，这双手几乎是不可能完成的。然而，对于少数能够做到的人来说，可以创造出一套真正非凡的铠甲，甚至可以把凡人变成神的刽子手。",

But, if you manage to scavenge a full intact shell of it, a worthy blacksmith can craft a suit of armor that will protect you from supernatural harm.": "构成马鲁特框架的合金在物质世界的任何地方都找不到。事实上，它在麦坎纳斯以外的任何地方都找不到，因为它实际上是由莫德隆母体世界的古老齿轮冶炼而成的。这种金属极其耐用而又轻巧，它的痕迹已被发现混入整个王国的传奇武器和盔甲中。但是，如果你设法收集到一个完整的外壳，一个有价值的铁匠可以制作一套盔甲，保护你免受超自然的伤害。",
	"Enforcer's Eye": "执法者的眼睛",
	"Cultures all across the Material Plane tend to share tales of leaders that sacrifice an eye in order to gain otherworldly levels of wisdom and judgement. While many are familiar with the subsequent exploits of these leaders, they never end up explaining what happens to the eye they sacrificed. Well, long story short, they end up on Sigil, where the modron leader, Primus, takes them and plants them into the marut where it grows to the size of a melon as the final step of their construction. These eyes see with both the wisdom of the universe and the empathy of mortals and they are what allow the marut to hunt and judge their contract holders better than any lesser construct possibly could.": "整个物质世界的文化都倾向于分享领导者的故事，他们牺牲了一只眼睛，以获得其他世界的智慧和判断力。虽然很多人都熟悉这些领袖后来的探索，但他们从未解释过他们牺牲的那只眼睛会怎样。好吧，长话短说，他们最终来到了Sigil，在那里，modron领袖Primus带着他们，并把他们种到marut里，在那里它长到了甜瓜大小，作为他们建设的最后一步。这双眼睛既能看到宇宙的智慧，又能看到凡人的同情心，它们使马鲁特能够比任何较小的构造物更好地猎取和判断他们的契约者。",

This engine is so perfect in its design that any attempt by mortal hands to tinker with it would ruin it irreparably.": "法令引擎是一个纯能量的漩涡，它为马鲁特提供动力，使其庞大的身躯能够以最强大的天使的力量和优雅的姿态移动。在一项只有普利姆斯才有能力完成的工程壮举中，该引擎以多元宇宙本身的逻辑运行，只要将物理法则捆绑在一起的古老契约保持不变，就能使马鲁特保持运转。这个引擎的设计是如此的完美，以至于凡人试图对它进行修补，都会对它造成不可弥补的破坏。",

Supporters of the latter theory hold up the nightwalker's \"anti-heart\" as evidence to support their claim. This antiheart appears to us as a dark, flame-like mote of negative energy nestled in the nightwalker's chest. The origin of its name is the fact that this organ seems to be diametrically linked to the trapped creature that released the nightwalker in the first place, shifting in unison with their own heartbeat and becoming stronger as the trapped creature grows weaker. Like all aspects of the nightwalker, the anti-heart exists only as a dark inversion of life and thus has powerful destructive and life-nullifying properties.": "关于夜行者是否自然存在于阴性界，还是只有当物质界的生物跨过门槛进入那个噩梦般的领域时，他们才会出现的问题，存在着大量的争议。后一种理论的支持者将夜行者的 \"反心 \"作为证据来支持他们的主张。这个反心在我们看来是一个黑暗的、像火焰一样的负能量斑点，依偎在夜行者的胸部。它的名字的由来是，这个器官似乎与当初释放夜行者的被困生物截然相反，随着他们自己的心跳而变化，并随着被困生物的变弱而变强。像夜行者的所有方面一样，反心只作为生命的黑暗反转而存在，因此具有强大的破坏性和扼杀生命的特性。",

	"Oblex Slime (5 vials)": "Oblex Slime (5小瓶)",
	"The slime of most oozes comprises little more than strings of proteins and acids that give them form and digestive capabilities. Oblexes are a little different however, as instead of simply digesting the body of its prey, an oblex also feeds on their mind and mental energies, thus necessitating a unique set of enzymes that react to the psionic field all creatures produce. These enzymes become mostly inert upon the oblex's death, but some Underdark societies have discovered fermentation techniques that can recycle the slime into an amnesia-inducing drink called \"fade\". This drink is famous for helping the imbiber forget bad memories; something you would probably want to do too if you lived in the horror that is the Underdark.": "大多数乌贼的粘液只是由一串串的蛋白质和酸组成，这些蛋白质和酸赋予它们形态和消化能力。然而，Oblexes有点不同，因为Oblex不是简单地消化猎物的身体，而是以他们的思想和精神能量为食，因此需要一套独特的酶，对所有生物产生的幻觉场产生反应。这些酶在大蛇死后大多会变成惰性物质，但一些暗黑社会已经发现了发酵技术，可以将粘液回收到一种叫做 \"消逝 \"的失忆饮料中。这种饮料以帮助饮用者忘记糟糕的记忆而闻名；如果你生活在恐怖的暗黑世界，你可能也会想这么做。",

When held loosely in one hand, the pedipalp will reorient itself towards the direction of the creature so long as it is within 5 miles and on the same plane of existence.": "如果你把一个生物所拥有的物体放在其中一个脚板上至少1分钟，这个脚板就会变得和那个生物相适应。当松散地握在一只手上时，只要该生物在5英里之内并且在同一平面上，该脚板就会朝着该生物的方向重新定位。",
	"Retriever Spirit": "猎犬精神",
	"Drow lack the technological prowess to create a fully sentient automaton the way the gnomes can. Instead, they rely on extraordinarily dark magic to provide the animating force for their constructs: torturing and binding a demon spirit until it can do nothing but obey and serve. The resulting spirit can hardly even be called by its original name, and at this point is little more than a tool to be used like any other. While it is distasteful, a skilled tinker can take this spirit and use it in their own experiments to lend them a darker, but stronger edge. {@b Requires {@item spirit paper|HHHVI}.}": "鸦人缺乏技术能力，无法像地精那样创造出一个完全有知觉的自动机。相反，他们依靠异常黑暗的魔法来为他们的构造提供动力：折磨和束缚一个恶魔的灵魂，直到它只能服从和服务。由此产生的精神甚至很难被称为它原来的名字，在这一点上，它只不过是一个可以像其他一样使用的工具。虽然它令人厌恶，但熟练的工匠可以利用这种精神，在他们自己的实验中使用它，使其具有更黑暗、但更强大的优势。{@b Requires {@item spirit paper|HHHVI}.}",
	"Beam Turret": "光束转塔",
	"One of the retriever's most deadly weapons is the turret located near where its mouth should be. This turret's design is based off of blueprints stolen by the drow from workshops in the Abyss and is capable of firing incredibly potent streams of energy to either kill or debilitate the retriever's opponents. It is incredibly difficult to reverse engineer these turrets, but they can be modified into something more suitable for mortal hands to wield into battle. In a pinch, this turret may also be used to fire the last of its lingering magic, but doing so without the bracing systems that the retriever would normally provide will irreversibly damage this piece.": "猎犬最致命的武器之一是位于它的嘴附近的炮塔。这个炮塔的设计是基于乌鸦从深渊工场偷来的蓝图，能够发射出令人难以置信的强大的能量流，杀死或削弱猎犬的对手。要对这些炮塔进行逆向工程是非常困难的，但它们可以被改造成更适合凡人之手在战场上挥舞的东西。在紧要关头，这个炮塔也可以用来发射其最后的残余魔法，但在没有回收器通常提供的支撑系统的情况下这样做将不可逆转地损坏这个部件。",
	"As an action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, forcing them to succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The {@condition paralyzed} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used once, this turret breaks apart and becomes useless.": "作为一个行动，你以你周围60英尺内的一个生物为目标，迫使他们在一个{@dc 18}宪法救赎中成功，或者被{@condition paralyzed}，持续1分钟。目标可以在每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对自己的影响。一旦这个能力被使用过一次，这个炮塔就会解体，变得毫无用处。",
	"Frost Salamander Blood (7 vials)": "冰霜蝾螈血（7瓶）",
	"The blood of a frost salamander moves with all the frigid pace of a glacier. Permanently cold to the touch, it retains some magic in it at all times that can be turned into a makeshift weapon oil to add frigid power to one's strikes.": "霜螈的血液以冰川般寒冷的速度移动。触手可及的永久寒冷，它始终保留着一些魔力，可以变成一种临时的武器油，为自己的攻击增加寒冷的力量。",
	"Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or one melee weapon. Applying this blood takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer an additional {@damage 1d6} cold damage and their movement is halved until the start of your next turn.": "可用于涂抹最多5件弹药或一件近战武器。涂抹这种血需要1分钟。在接下来的一分钟内，任何被成功击中的生物都必须做一个{@dc 17}宪法救赎动作。如果失败，他们会受到额外的{@damage 1d6}寒冷伤害，并且他们的行动会减半，直到你下一个回合开始。",
	"Frost Salamander Fang": "霜蝾螈方",
	"The fangs of a frost salamander carry within them all the bite of winter's cold. They are highly prized as a weapon material, and it is common to see strings of them adorning the necks of frost giants to boast of their hunting prowess.": "霜螈的獠牙带着冬天寒冷的气息。它们是非常珍贵的武器材料，经常可以看到一串串冰霜巨兽的獠牙装饰在脖子上，以夸耀他们的狩猎能力。",
	"Frost Salamander Scales (large pouch)": "霜蝾螈的鳞片（大袋装）",
	"Like their fire-based cousins, frost salamander scales are incredibly valuable for their elemental harnessing properties. A frost salamander's scales stay supernaturally cold long after death, and they are coveted as materials for making iceboxes in the larders of wealthy individuals. Crafted into armor, they take advantage of the frost salamander's strange reaction to heat in which they seem to derive energy from blazing fires despite their own icy constitution.": "就像它们的火系表亲一样，霜螈的鳞片也因其元素驾驭能力而具有难以置信的价值。霜螈的鳞片在死后很长一段时间内都会保持超自然的冰冷，它们被觊觎为制作富人储藏室里的冰柜的材料。在制作盔甲时，他们利用了霜螈对热的奇怪反应，尽管他们本身是冰冷的体质，但他们似乎从炽热的火焰中获得了能量。",
	"Frost Salamander Breath Pouch": "霜蝾螈呼吸袋",
	"Worse than a wintery blast, the breath of a frost salamander is capable of snapfreezing just about anything that it comes across. The organ responsible for such power is a melon-sized bladder located just above its gullet. Filled with special chemicals, this bladder can either be tapped for unique potion ingredients, or simply burst open to create a freezing explosion.": "霜螈的呼吸比冬天的暴风雪更可怕，它能够将遇到的任何东西都冻住。负责这种力量的器官是一个瓜子大小的膀胱，就在它的咽喉上方。这个囊中装满了特殊的化学物质，既可以用来提取独特的药水成分，也可以简单地爆开，创造出一个冰冻爆炸。",
	"As an action, you may throw this bladder to a space up to 20 feet away, causing it to burst upon impact, releasing a nova of freezing cold. Any creature within 10 feet of it must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 8d10} cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.": "作为一个动作，你可以将这个囊袋扔到20英尺以外的地方，使它在撞击时爆裂，释放出一个冰冷的新星。任何在它10英尺范围内的生物都必须做一个{@dc 17}体质救赎，如果救赎失败会受到{@damage 8d10}寒冷伤害，如果救赎成功会受到一半的伤害。",
	"{@dice 1d4} day's worth of {@item rations (1 day)|PHB|rations}": "{@dice 1d4}天的价值{@item rations (1 day)|PHB|rations}",
	"1 iron idol of the {@deity Raven Queen|Dawn War|DMG}": "1个铁神像的{@deity Raven Queen|Dawn War|DMG}",
	"1 book of poetry": "1本诗集",
	"1 string of hunting trophies": "1串狩猎战利品",
