	"The {@race Elezen|FFXIV} are elves who hail from Eorzea who call the lands of Gridania and Ishgard their home. Taller than regular elves, they have naturally good eyesight and are well intuned with the land. Over time they split into two groups, the Wildwood whom are light skinned and dextrous, skilled with a bow and live in either dense forests or their highly religious city-state homeland. Their relatives the Duskwights live in a series of twisting tunnels and ruins underground, coming up only to hunt for food or pillage before returning to their cavernous homes.": "{@race Elezen|FFXIV}是来自Eorzea的精灵，他们把Gridania和Ishgard的土地当作自己的家。他们比普通的精灵更高大，有天生的好视力，对土地很熟悉。随着时间的推移，他们分成了两个群体：野人族，他们皮肤白皙，身手矫健，擅长使用弓箭，生活在茂密的森林或他们高度宗教化的城邦故乡。他们的亲戚黄昏族生活在地下一系列曲折的隧道和废墟中，只有在返回他们的洞穴家园之前才会上来猎取食物或掠夺。",
	"The {@race Garlean|FFXIV|Garleans} are physically strong and highly intelligent people who call the land of Ilsabard their home. They are marked by their third {@i eye}, a gem like growth in the center of their forehead. Unfortunately for them, the Garleans as a whole have great difficulty channeling aether through their bodies, which despite their physicality and intelligence, found themselves bowing to many other magic wielding races. They were eventually able to develop technology to make up for this lack of magical aptitude and turned the tables, establishing the Garlean Empire in Ilsabard, a dominate force which sought to invade the land of Eorzea.": "{@race Garlean|FFXIV|Garleans}是身体强壮、高智商的人，他们把伊萨巴德的土地当作自己的家。他们的标志是他们的第三颗{@i eye}，在他们额头的中心有一颗像宝石一样的东西。不幸的是，加里安人作为一个整体，很难通过他们的身体引导乙太，尽管他们的身体和智慧，发现他们向许多其他挥舞魔法的种族低头。他们最终能够发展出技术来弥补这种魔法能力的不足，并扭转了局面，在伊尔萨巴德建立了加林帝国，一个试图入侵Eorzea土地的主导力量。",
	"The {@race Hrothgar|FFXIV} are powerful, feline people from the Northeast who had struggles when meeting the other races of the world as they were unable to speak the common tongue. They call Ilsabard their homeland and they walk two distinct paths, one of servitude and the other of freedom. These distinct paths and ways of life led to the Helions, warm coloured Hrothgar who serve in the name of their Queen, and The Lost, cool coloured Hrothgar who value freedom above all else.": "{@race Hrothgar|FFXIV}是来自东北部的强大的猫科动物人，他们在遇到世界上其他种族时有过挣扎，因为他们不能说共同的语言。他们把伊萨巴德称为自己的家园，他们走着两条不同的道路，一条是奴役，另一条是自由。这些不同的道路和生活方式导致了 \"海利安\"（Helions）和 \"失落\"（The Lost），前者是暖色系的赫鲁斯加，以女王的名义服务，后者是冷色系的赫鲁斯加，重视自由高于一切。",
	"The {@race Hyur|FFXIV} have spread across the entirety of the world, making it difficult to trace what their homeland truly is. There are the average sized Midlanders, named for the elevation in which their sub species lived for many years, and the taller, more muscular highlanders, who lived in the high mountains for their declared homeland.": "{@race Hyur|FFXIV}已经遍布整个世界，使人很难追踪他们真正的故乡是什么。有中等身材的米德兰人，因其亚种生活多年的海拔高度而得名，还有身材高大、肌肉发达的高地人，他们生活在高山上，是他们宣称的故乡。",
	"The {@race Lalafell|FFXIV} immigrated from Southern islands to Eorzea forming two distinct groups based on the geography their ancestors settled in. The darker skinned Dunesfolk formed the city state of Ul'dah in the deserts of Thanalan, while the lighter skinned Planesfolk settled and farmed the lands of La Noscea, a large island off the mainland of Eorzea. Both of these naturally charming folk found great success as merchants through history.": "{@race Lalafell|FFXIV}从南方岛屿移民到Eorzea，根据他们祖先定居的地理环境形成了两个不同的群体。肤色较深的沙丘人在塔纳兰的沙漠中形成了乌尔达城邦，而肤色较浅的飞机人则在拉诺斯卡的土地上定居和耕种，拉诺斯卡是Eorzea大陆外的一个大岛。在历史上，这两个天生迷人的民族都作为商人取得了巨大的成功。",
	"The {@race Miqo'te|FFXIV} are a second group of feline people who traveled to Eorzea across a frozen sea long ago. These proud people find pride in their natural hunting ability and have split into two distinct ethnic groups who worship the sun and moon respectively. The Seekers of the Sun live in warmer clients in patriarchal societies while The Keepers of the Moon live in dense forests, their tribes centering on matriarchs.": "{@race Miqo'te|FFXIV}是第二批猫科动物人，他们在很久以前穿越冰冻的海洋来到Eorzea。这些骄傲的人在他们天生的狩猎能力中找到了自豪感，并分裂成两个不同的族群，分别崇拜太阳和月亮。太阳的探索者生活在温暖的客户中，处于父权制社会，而月亮的守护者则生活在茂密的森林中，他们的部落以女主人为中心。",
	"The {@race Roegadyn|FFXIV} are large, hulking people who hail from the mountains and the sea. The Sea Wolves are known as famed pirates and settled the coastal city state Limsa Lominsa, while the Hellsguard live in villages atop mountains and volcanoes, acting as keepers of the land, believing such locations to be portals to other worlds.": "{@race Roegadyn|FFXIV}是大块头的人，他们来自山和海。海狼族是著名的海盗，在沿海城市利姆萨-洛明萨定居，而地狱守卫则居住在山顶和火山的村庄里，充当土地的守护者，认为这些地方是通往其他世界的门户。",
	"The {@race Viera|FFXIV} are lapine people who live in dense forests and act as the protectors of their home. With their more secluded nature, they generally avoid contact with the outside world, happily protecting the Golmore Jungles and Skatay Range, both found in the east. There are two distinct groups of Viera who developed slightly differently based on their homes, the Rava having darker skin while the Veena have far fairer skin, both groups blending into their respective environments better thanks to these adaptations.": "{@race Viera|FFXIV}是生活在密林中的拉皮内人，充当他们家园的保护者。由于他们比较隐蔽，他们一般避免与外界接触，乐于保护戈尔莫丛林和斯卡泰山脉，这两个地方都在东部。有两个不同的维埃拉群体，他们根据自己的家园发展得略有不同，拉瓦人的皮肤较黑，而维埃纳人的皮肤则要白得多，由于这些适应性，两个群体都能更好地融入各自的环境。",

To take up and master the katana is to enter a league of your own, though not every samurai has been known to wield the blade for a master, some choosing to follow their own code and travel the world.": "武士依靠内在能量和不可动摇的纪律。这些都是武士们建立自己声誉的工具。拿起并掌握武士刀就是进入了一个属于自己的联盟，尽管并不是每个武士都为主人挥舞刀剑，有些人选择遵循自己的准则，周游世界。",
	"When creating a Samurai, you have to decide how they became involved in the discipline. Were they born into the tradition, being the son of a samurai or lord? Perhaps they fight in a self taught style which they continually hone through their travels.": "当创建一个武士时，你必须决定他们如何参与到这个学科中。他们是否出生在传统中，是武士或领主的儿子？也许他们以自学的方式战斗，通过旅行不断地磨练自己。",
	"On top of their roots as a samurai, you must consider why you fight as a samurai. Are you on a quest on behalf of a lord, or directly protecting their master's lands. Perhaps they cast off their ties to their masters and teachers altogether and travel the world for their own gain, or the protection of the common man.": "在他们作为武士的根基之上，你必须考虑你为什么作为武士而战斗。你是在代表领主进行探险，还是直接保护他们主人的土地。也许他们完全抛弃了与主人和老师的关系，为了自己的利益或保护普通人而环游世界。",

Warrior bands once roamed unsettled lands as nomads, enjoying the boons which nature offers and defending the weak from those who would do them harm.": "战士在类似于野蛮人的古代部落中找到自己的根源。这些无畏的战士在控制一种他们称之为内在野兽的力量方面是无以伦比的。战士通常来自部落背景，在那里他们学会培养和控制这种内在的动物，这反过来又赋予他们野兽般的力量和凶猛。战士队伍曾经作为游牧民族在未开发的土地上游荡，享受大自然提供的恩惠，并保护弱者不受那些人的伤害。",
	"Not unlike nature itself, a Warrior has the potential to become a relentless force of destruction. Like a raging forest fire, or an all consuming tidal wave, a warrior can unleash their inner beast to harness its rage. This state of being is known as berserking.

	"When creating a Warrior, one must consider their origins as a warrior. Are you a descendant of the ancient tribes from which warriors are able to draw their lineage? Perhaps you were a fledgeling adventurer who found a mentor in the form of a former warrior who passed on the secrets of the inner beast. Perhaps you had a natural attunement to the ways of the warrior and have developed your skills without guidance.": "当创建一个战士时，必须考虑他们作为战士的起源。你是古代部落的后裔，而战士们能够从这些部落中获得他们的血统？也许你是一个初出茅庐的冒险家，找到了一个传授内在野兽秘密的前战士的导师。也许你对战士的方式有天然的适应性，并在没有指导的情况下发展了自己的技能。",

Warriors set out for any number of reasons.": "你还必须考虑你为什么要踏上冒险的生活？作为一个战士，你是否决定寻找危险的挑战来磨练你的技能或满足你内心饥饿的野兽的胃口？也许你已经拿起武器来保卫你的部落、村庄或所爱之人？勇士们出于各种原因出发。",

	"White Mage's strength stems from an art they refer to as conjury. Conjury calls upon the elements of earth, wind, and water and concentrates them to a potency at which spells can be weaved. Through practiced meditation on the essences of creation, conjurers draw forth and absorb magic from their immediate surroundings. A wand or cane made from unworked wood is then utilized to focus the magical energy until it manifests as the desired spell. Versed also in magicks that restore and strengthen, White Mages are regarded as accomplished healers.": "白袍法师的力量源于他们所说的一种艺术--咒语。魔法师召唤土、风、水等元素，并将它们集中到可以编织法术的效力上。通过对创造的本质进行练习冥想，魔法师从他们周围的环境中汲取和吸收魔法。然后利用未经加工的木材制成的魔杖或手杖来集中魔法能量，直到它表现为所需的咒语。白袍法师也精通恢复和强化的魔法，被认为是有成就的治疗师。",
	"White Mages find their roots in a society which revered nature as an ally, borrowing the power of the land and elementals to soothe wounds and protect from the wicked. Over time, the White Mages of the past overused this power causing the elementals to act out and smite the land, alongside the damage wrought by the opposing Black Mages, the world fell into a dark age. Today White Mages are few and far between, practicing the forbidden art to wield the powers of nature and light to drive off evil in protection of the world again.": "白袍法师在一个崇尚自然的社会中找到了自己的根基，他们借用土地和元素的力量来抚慰伤口，保护人们免受邪恶的侵害。随着时间的推移，过去的白袍法师们过度使用这种力量，导致元素爆发并袭击了土地，再加上敌对的黑袍法师的破坏，世界陷入了黑暗时代。今天，白袍法师已经少之又少，他们在练习禁忌之术，挥舞自然和光明的力量，驱除邪恶，保护世界。",
	"When creating a White Mage one must question how they came into the art of conjury and the profession of White Mage. Did a kindly mentor take you under their wing? Did your studies of magic from the past lead you to discovering how to draw power from the world you lived in? Perhaps the elementals which inhabit the land reached out to you and their whispers guided you to the path of a White Mage. Nonetheless a White Mage's role in the world is that of a protector, soothing the wounds of those who need it most, settling enraged elementals and driving the beings who bring destruction back from whence they came.": "在创造白袍法师时，人们必须问他们是如何进入魔法艺术和白袍法师这个职业的。是一位好心的导师把你带到他们的翅膀下吗？你对过去的魔法研究是否导致你发现如何从你生活的世界中汲取力量？也许是居住在这片土地上的元素向你伸出了手，他们的低语引导你走上了白袍法师的道路。尽管如此，白袍法师在这个世界上的角色是保护者，抚慰那些最需要它的人的伤口，安抚被激怒的元素，并将带来毁灭的生物从他们来的地方赶回去。",
