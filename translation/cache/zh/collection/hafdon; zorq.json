In such a setting, the girallons take full advantage of their skill in climbing. The creatures can easily scale walls and battlements, and they perch on tower tops and other high vantages to keep an eye on the surrounding area.": " 人类居住地的废墟，特别是那些在深山老林和丛林中发现的废墟，似乎吸引着长颈鹿。它们可以毫不费力地沿着楼梯和阳台移动，也可以在倾斜的屋顶和这些建筑的壁垒上移动。对Girallon来说，城市的建筑只是另一种森林，而且最好是最上面的 \"树枝 \"能够轻松地支撑起这些生物。在这样的环境中，Girallons充分利用它们的攀爬技能。这些生物可以很容易地攀爬墙壁和城墙，它们栖息在塔顶和其他高处，以监视周围的情况。",

They rule their own societies according to the efreet model, in which larger and stronger salamanders claim dominion over their lesser kin.": "尽管蝾螈遵循其火热本性的破坏性冲动，但在埃弗里特人的奴役下，自由蝾螈的文化受到影响。他们根据埃弗里特的模式来统治自己的社会，在这种模式下，较大和较强壮的蝾螈对其较小的亲属拥有统治权。",

	"This inherent heat is an asset to salamanders' skill as smiths, allowing them to soften and shape iron and steel with their bare hands.

Powerful creatures summon them as warriors, but others enlist the salamanders for their crafting skills, or bind them to forges and ovens to generate limitless heat.": "这种与生俱来的热量是蝾螈作为铁匠技能的一项资产，使他们能够徒手软化和塑造铁和钢。虽然没有阿泽尔人那么细致，但蝾螈也是所有星球上最伟大的金属匠人之一。强大的生物把它们当作战士来召唤，但其他生物则因为它们的工艺技能而招募蝾螈，或者把它们绑在锻造炉和烤箱上以产生无限的热量。",

	"Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores.

	"A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.": "蓝龙将自己的巢穴保密并保护得很好，即使是它最信任的仆人也很少被允许进入。它鼓励阿克塞斯、巨蝎和其他沙漠生物居住在它的巢穴附近，以增加安全感。年长的蓝龙有时会吸引空气元素和其他生物为其服务。",

When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.": "如果蓝龙的巢穴被入侵，它就会把构成其巢穴的洞穴弄塌。然后，龙会钻出洞穴，让攻击者被压死和窒息。当它后来回来时，它会收集它的财产--连同死去的入侵者的财富。",

	" Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it.

	"Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.": "色素龙因其优越感而团结在一起，认为自己是所有凡人生物中最强大和最有价值的。当他们与其他生物互动时，只是为了促进自己的利益。他们相信自己有与生俱来的统治权，这种信念是每条色龙的个性和世界观的基石。试图羞辱一条色龙就像试图说服风停止吹动。对这些生物来说，人类是动物，适合作为猎物或负担的野兽，完全不值得尊重。",
	"A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.": "龙的巢穴是其权力的所在地，也是其财宝的保险库。凭借其天生的韧性和对严重环境影响的耐受力，龙选择或建造的巢穴不是为了躲避，而是为了防御，倾向于多个入口和出口，以及对其囤积物的保护。",
	"Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.": "大多数色龙的巢穴都隐藏在危险和偏远的地方，除了最大胆的凡人之外，其他的人都无法接近它们。黑龙的巢穴可能在一个巨大的沼泽中心，而红龙则可能在一座活火山的破火山口上。除了巢穴的自然防御外，强大的色龙还使用魔法守护者、陷阱和顺从的生物来保护它们的宝藏。",
	"Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells.

They fashion nets to capture their enemies, which are dragged back to the lair and sacrificed on a makeshift altar.

They hate almost any creature they perceive as better than they are, which includes almost anyone, but they lack the courage or wherewithal to act on their hatred most of the time.
