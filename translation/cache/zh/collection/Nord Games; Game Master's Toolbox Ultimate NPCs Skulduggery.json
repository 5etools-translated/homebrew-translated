	"Like many gamers out there, we have been overfl owing with creativity since an early age. Creative writing, poetry, art and music have always played a large role in our lives, but it was during our teenage years that all of those talents and passions were ignited into a fi re storm of excitement when we sat down for our fi rst session of Dungeons & Dragons. Although we didn't know it at the time, that fi rst game would be a life changing experience. For almost two decades now we've been creating characters and going on fantastic adventures, each more exciting than the last!": "像许多游戏玩家一样，我们从很小的时候起就充满了创造力。创意写作、诗歌、艺术和音乐一直在我们的生活中扮演着重要角色，但在我们十几岁的时候，当我们坐下来玩第一场龙与地下城时，所有这些天赋和激情都被点燃，变成了一场兴奋的风暴。虽然我们当时并不知道，但这第一场游戏将是一次改变人生的经历。近二十年来，我们一直在创造角色，进行奇妙的冒险，每一次都比上一次更令人激动！\"。",
	"When the latest version of D&D hit the shelves, we were eager to try it out. We had been part of the beta testing process and saw many new and interesting rules enter the scene. We enjoyed the Starter Set, and we picked up each of the core rule books as soon as they were available. For a year we've been meeting weekly, and sometimes daily, for game sessions where we've explored perilous dungeons, faced insurmountable hordes, fought deadly foes, and conquered monstrous beasts. We've lost a few party members along the way, but their names will be remembered as we reminisce for years to come about the epic adventures we all had together.": "当最新版本的D&D上架时，我们急切地想尝试一下。我们参加了测试过程，看到许多新的和有趣的规则进入了现场。我们很喜欢入门套装，每本核心规则书一上市，我们就拿了出来。一年来，我们每周，有时是每天，都会举行游戏会议，我们探索危险的地下城，面对不可逾越的大军，与致命的敌人战斗，并征服了可怕的野兽。一路走来，我们失去了一些党员，但他们的名字会被记住，因为我们会在未来的日子里回忆起我们一起经历的史诗般的冒险。",
	"This very topic got all of us thinking. How can we help the gaming community, both Game Masters and Players, to get the most out of their gaming experience? Th e question wasn't easy to answer. Th ere is already so much excellent content out there, what would gamers really need that doesn't already exist? ": "这个话题引起了我们所有人的思考。我们如何才能帮助游戏社区，包括游戏管理员和玩家，从他们的游戏体验中获得最大的收益？这个问题并不容易回答。外面已经有这么多优秀的内容，玩家真正需要的是什么，而不是已经存在的？",
	"The answer came quite naturally one night during a game session when our Game Master was going a bit off  script and needed an unplanned NPC to interact with the Players. It took him longer than usual to create the NPC from what he had to work with, and aft er a few rolls he had enough, but not much more than that. Th ere was no backstory, no real personality beyond the stereotype based on race and gender.": "一天晚上，在一次游戏过程中，我们的游戏主人有点不按剧本办事，需要一个计划外的NPC与玩家互动，答案很自然地出现了。他花了比平时更多的时间来创造这个NPC，经过几次滚动，他有了足够的东西，但没有更多。没有背景故事，除了基于种族和性别的刻板印象之外，没有真正的个性。",
	"We instantly saw a need for a resource book that didn't exist yet: a book populated by NPCs that had more to them than just a name, race and class. A book that could be used by a Game Master to populate a tavern, or a trading post, or a banquet hall. Alternatively, the book could be used by Players to create starting characters, or to spy out character progression, or to create characters at later levels if they come late to the adventure and the rest of the Players' characters have already leveled up a few times.": "我们立刻看到了对一本还不存在的资源书的需求：一本由NPC组成的书，这些NPC不仅仅有名字、种族和等级。一本可以由游戏管理员用来填充酒馆、贸易站或宴会厅的书。另外，玩家也可以用这本书来创建起始角色，或者窥探角色的进展，或者在冒险过程中，如果他们来晚了，而其他玩家的角色已经升了几级，就可以创建后期的角色。",
	"We brainstormed and collaborated, seeing our quest unfold before us. It would not be an easy task, but nothing worth doing ever is. We all know that; our years of role playing games have proven it time and time again. You can't just stroll in and slay the dragon, it takes planning, preparation, talent, and teamwork to accomplish the hardest quests. So that's what we've done.": "我们集思广益，通力合作，看到我们的追求在我们面前展开。这不是一项容易的任务，但没有什么值得做的事是容易的。我们都知道；我们多年的角色扮演游戏已经一次又一次地证明了这一点。你不能只是漫步而来，屠龙而去，它需要计划、准备、才能和团队合作来完成最艰难的任务。所以这就是我们所做的。",
	"Th is book was written to be a resource to Game Masters and Players alike. It contains a wealth of information for developing plot points, character behaviors, histories, guilds, and many other valuable assets designed to aid in the running and playing of fantasy role playing games.": "本书是为游戏管理员和玩家编写的资源。它包含了丰富的信息，用于开发情节点、人物行为、历史、行会和许多其他有价值的资产，旨在帮助运行和玩奇幻角色扮演游戏。",
	"For Game Masters this book is a valuable resource and time saving tool. Whether during your pre-game prep, or on the fl y, you'll be able to pull NPCs from this book to aid, hinder, or challenge your Players. Th e book is split into three large sections—Good Aligned Characters, Neutral Aligned Characters, and Evil Aligned Characters. Each of these sections is self-explanatory and contains ten unique characters who have been completely detailed with backstory, traits, roleplaying cues, actions, and items. Th is attention to detail during the character creation and writing process saves you time during the preparation process and game session.": "对于游戏管理员来说，这本书是一个宝贵的资源和节省时间的工具。无论是在游戏前的准备阶段，还是在游戏过程中，你都可以从这本书中提取NPC来帮助、阻碍或挑战你的玩家。本书分为三个大的部分--好的结盟角色、中立的结盟角色和邪恶的结盟角色。每个部分都是不言自明的，包含了十个独特的角色，他们的背景故事、特征、角色扮演的线索、行动和物品都是完全详细的。在角色创建和写作过程中，对细节的关注为你在准备过程和游戏环节中节省了时间。",
	"You have access to 30 completely unique NPCs at six diff erent levels, eff ectively giving you 180 diff erent NPCs to use during your campaign or game session. Make sure to utilize the Encounter Table on page 5, as well as the encounter tables at the beginning of each group of similarly aligned characters. ": "你可以使用6个不同级别的30个完全独特的NPC，有效地让你在竞选或游戏过程中使用180个不同的NPC。请确保利用第5页的遭遇表，以及每组类似排列的角色开始时的遭遇表。",
	"Have you ever had an idea for a character but didn't know where to start? Or perhaps you knew where you'd like to start but didn't know where your path would lead you. Th is book fi xes both dilemmas by providing Players with a starting point, mid points, and an ending point for each character.": "你是否曾经有一个关于角色的想法，但不知道从哪里开始？或者，你知道你想从哪里开始，但不知道你的道路会把你引向哪里。本书通过为玩家提供每个角色的起点、中间点和终点来解决这两个难题。",
	"This makes it possible to not only duplicate an NPC for your level 1 character, but to also use higher level NPCs as your own character in the eventuality that you need a higher level character. All of their attributes, skills, features, items, weapons, and other mechanics have already been calculated and optimized. Th is means you spend less time working out the math, and more time slaying dragons!": "这使得你不仅可以为你的1级角色复制一个NPC，而且还可以在你需要更高级别的角色时将更高级别的NPC作为你自己的角色。他们所有的属性、技能、特征、物品、武器和其他机制都已经被计算和优化。这意味着你花在计算上的时间更少，而花在屠龙上的时间更多!",
	"Not all groups that work outside the law work to a nefarious end; perhaps the law is infl exible, negligent, or even evil itself. Below are some examples of shady organizations working for the greater good, along with a suggested membership.": "并非所有在法律之外工作的团体都是为了邪恶的目的；也许法律是可行的、疏忽的，甚至是邪恶本身。以下是一些为更大利益而工作的黑社会组织的例子，以及建议的成员。",
	"Taxes, rent, tithes; as Th e Purse Cutters see it, the rich are all thieves of one stripe or another, and everyone knows that stealing from thieves doesn't count. Besides, any decent sort of person would be glad to see their money go towards helping the poor and needy. Sometimes specifi c targets are pointed out—the particularly corrupt, greedy or tyrannical—other times each member is free to do as they see fi t, as long as they make a contribution to the group's earnings. Said earnings are distributed amongst the lower rungs of society. Strangely enough, whenever the city watch makes enquiries about the latest wave of pickpockets, the poorer populace seem to forget all about these transactions...  Tauberel (p.62) is the de facto leader of the group. She never strove for leadership, but she is the best thief among them, and has the most fi re for the cause.": "税收、租金、什一税；在 \"切钱包者 \"看来，富人都是这样或那样的小偷，而每个人都知道，从小偷那里偷东西不算数。此外，任何正派的人都会很高兴看到他们的钱用于帮助穷人和需要帮助的人。有时会指出特定的目标--特别腐败、贪婪或暴虐的人--有时每个成员都可以自由地做他们认为该做的事，只要他们为团体的收入做出贡献。这些收入被分配给社会的低层人士。奇怪的是，每当城管对最近一波扒手进行调查时，较贫穷的民众似乎都忘记了这些交易......  Tauberel（第62页）是这个团体的实际领导者。她从不追求领导地位，但她是他们中最好的小偷，对事业最热心。",
	"{@creature Tam Fletcher|Skul} (p.56) and {@creature Natterjack|Skul} (p.44) are associates and accessories with varying levels of commitment to The Purse Cutters as a whole, but great personal loyalty to Tauberel.": "{@creature Tam Fletcher|Skul}(第56页)和{@creature Natterjack|Skul}(第44页)是同伙和配件，对整个钱包切割者有不同程度的承诺，但对陶贝尔有很大的个人忠诚度。",
	"Is there any animal more loyal than a raven? Not if you ask any member of this guild. What started in antiquity as an organization of messengers for the king's personal use became much more through the generations. Before long, Th e Ravens had become a society of scribes, bird trainers and messengers whose sole purpose was the spreading of knowledge.": "有什么动物比乌鸦更忠诚吗？如果你问这个行会的任何成员就不会。从古代开始，它只是一个供国王个人使用的信使组织，经过几代人的努力，变得更加丰富。不久之后，\"乌鸦 \"已经成为一个由文士、驯鸟师和信使组成的社会，其唯一目的是传播知识。",
	"Their intention was to quickly spread news across the realm to the benefi t of all but, as is all too common, their power was soon turned to darker purposes. The king used The Ravens as a platform to spread propaganda and condemn those groups who opposed or spoke ill of him.": "他们的目的是在整个王国迅速传播消息，使所有人受益，但是，正如所有常见的情况一样，他们的力量很快就被转用于更黑暗的目的。国王利用 \"乌鸦 \"作为传播宣传的平台，谴责那些反对他或对他说坏话的团体。",
	"The Raven leaders who did not agree to spread the king's messages were jailed, and the remaining scribes, forced to write falsities, conspired together. The remaining elders among them, meanwhile, decided to leave the service of the king and instead live a life of seclusion and secrecy. No longer would they live in the lap of luxury within the palace. Th eir dedication to the spreading of truth and knowledge led to a collective agreement to abandon the lap of luxury in the dead of night.": "不同意传播国王信息的乌鸦领袖被关进了监狱，剩下的文士们被迫写假话，一起密谋。同时，他们中剩下的长老决定离开国王的服务，转而过着隐居和保密的生活。他们不再生活在皇宫里的奢华之中。他们对传播真理和知识的献身精神导致了一个集体协议，即在夜深人静时放弃奢华的生活。",
	"The king was understandably furious when the news reached him that his scribes had vanished. He cursed their names and off ered a prince's ransom for their capture, but the search was fruitless. The scribes had all taken new names and histories and settled in new cities as far away as they could manage.": "当国王得知他的文士们消失的消息时，可以理解他的愤怒。他咒骂他们的名字，并提出用王子的赎金来捉拿他们，但搜寻工作毫无结果。文士们都取了新的名字和历史，并在他们能做到的最远的新城市定居。",
	"Now, decades on, whispers and rumors of The Ravens have begun to be spoken around the tables at local inns. News is spread through small notes, oft en transported on a trained raven's ankle. The literate then spread the news among those who can only speak the common tongue": "现在，几十年过去了，关于乌鸦的窃窃私语和传言已经开始在当地旅馆的餐桌上流传。消息是通过小纸条传播的，通常是用训练有素的乌鸦的脚踝来运输。识字的人就在那些只会说普通话的人中传播消息。",
	"The Ravens stand for truth above all else, and if any story in the realm is to have weight, it oft en starts with the words: \"A Raven told me...\"": "乌鸦代表着真理至上，如果该领域的任何故事要有分量，它往往以这样的话开始。\"一只乌鸦告诉我......\"",
	"The Red Gloves have a long and sordid history. Originally they were an aristocratic group lead by a man called Hammonder Strattenbury, a wealthy land owner in the realm. He and his constituents were oft en invited to fancy gatherings reserved for nobility and the landed gentry. Th e reason was simple: he controlled vast tracts of land excellent for farming and, although not everyone needs a fancy palace with a view overlooking a valley, everyone does need to eat. This made Hammonder very powerful in times of plenty, and even more so in times of need.": "红手套组织有着悠久而肮脏的历史。最初，他们是一个贵族团体，由一个叫哈蒙德-斯特拉滕伯里的人领导，他是王国的一个富有的土地所有者。他和他的选民们经常被邀请参加专为贵族和地主阶级举办的豪华聚会。原因很简单：他控制着大片适合耕种的土地，虽然不是每个人都需要一座可以俯瞰山谷的豪华宫殿，但每个人都需要吃饭。这使得汉蒙德在富足的时候非常强大，而在需要的时候更是如此。",
	"The Red Gloves remained a welcome addition to any social gathering of the upper class for many decades but little did they know there was a vagabond in their midst": "几十年来，\"红手套 \"在上层社会的任何社交聚会中都是受欢迎的，但他们不知道在他们中间有一个流浪者。",
	"Tatan of the house Freely, as he named himself when fi rst introduced to Hammonder, was an imposter. He was not of a noble house, as he claimed to be, nor indeed did he have any wealth to speak of. He was, in fact, a thief. He had traveled the realm, never staying in a village, town, or city long enough to get comfortable. Th is time, however, he saw the chance to tip the scales in the favor of those less fortunate.": "自由家族的塔坦，正如他第一次被介绍给哈曼德时所说的那样，是个冒牌货。他并不像他所宣称的那样来自一个贵族家庭，也没有任何财富可言。事实上，他是个盗贼。他走遍了整个王国，从未在一个村庄、城镇或城市停留过足够长的时间来适应。然而，这一次，他看到了使天平倾向于那些不太幸运的人的机会。",
	"He quickly gained the favor of Hammonder, representing himself as a man with a long history concerning trade and commerce. After many years of improving business from the farms, he proposed to Hammonder that he handle more of the business arrangements. By this time, the old man was living comfortably in his retirement and felt there was no one more suited to the task. Promptly agreeing, he spent the rest of his years enjoying his wealth and attending lavish gatherings with the realm's elite until his death at a well-earned, but untimely, age of sixty three. With Hammonder having no heirs to lay claim to the land or the vast wealth he had accumulated, Tatan found himself in a hard place. Th e law of the land stated that the property of an heirless lord, in absense of a will, would become the property of the crown. Tatan and other friends of the old man had searched through his belongings for such a document, but to no avail.": "他很快就获得了汉蒙德的青睐，把自己说成是一个在贸易和商业方面有着悠久历史的人。在从农场改善业务多年后，他向哈曼德提议由他来处理更多的业务安排。这时，这位老人已经过上了舒适的退休生活，并认为没有人比他更适合这项任务了。他立即同意，并在余下的岁月里享受他的财富，与王国的精英们一起参加奢华的聚会，直到他在63岁的时候去世，这是他应得的，但也是不合时宜的。由于哈曼德没有继承人，无法对土地或他所积累的巨额财富提出要求，塔坦发现自己陷入了困境。国家法律规定，在没有遗嘱的情况下，没有继承人的领主的财产将成为国王的财产。塔坦和老人的其他朋友在他的物品中寻找这样一份文件，但没有结果。",
	"Digging through his connections to underground networks of thieves and criminals, Tatan sought the aid of The Quills (p.68), a tight-lipped guild of forgers who artfully produce any document that need requires, if the requester is willing to pay the price... Just two days before the king was to lay claim on the property of Hammonder, a will was unexpectantly discovered in his most personal eff ects declaring Tatan and four other members of Th e Red Gloves benefi ciaries of his vast estate. Th e wealth was divided evenly between the fi ve and, so great a compensation was just one fi ft h of his wealth, the other four kept to themselves any grievance that Tatan appeared to have been given the entirety of Hammonder's land. Tatan was quickly named Lord and took up residence in the Lord's House in which Hammonder had lived.": "塔坦通过他与小偷和罪犯的地下网络的联系，寻求 \"鹅毛笔\"（第68页）的帮助，这是一个口风很紧的伪造者行会，只要请求者愿意付出代价，他们就能巧妙地制作出任何需要的文件...... 就在国王要对汉蒙德的财产提出要求的前两天，一份遗嘱在他最私人的文件中被意外发现，宣布塔坦和其他四名红手套成员是他巨大财产的受益人。这些财富被平均分配给这五人，而且，如此巨大的补偿只是他财富的一部分，其他四人对塔坦似乎已经得到了汉蒙德的全部土地而感到不满。塔坦很快被任命为领主，并在汉蒙德曾居住的领主之家居住。",
	"Even today, members of Th e Red Gloves consist of former criminals of one ilk or another. They use their power to subtly sway the pendulum of politics in their favor, with a philosophy that life is but a play and we are all actors in it. We each have much to gain if we play the right part.": "即使在今天，\"红手套 \"的成员仍由这样或那样的前罪犯组成。他们利用自己的权力巧妙地摇摆政治的钟摆，使之有利于自己，他们的理念是：生活不过是一场戏，我们都是其中的演员。如果我们扮演正确的角色，我们每个人都会有很多收获。",
	"It happens in the city; parents die, weaken in sickness or turn to drink, and children are abandoned or are forced to run away.

Th eir exact numbers are diffi  cult to guess and constantly fl uctuating, but generally there are around 15. Th ey are always on the move, scratching their crude symbol on walls and rooft iles to indicate the current place of safety. Without greed, and taking no pleasure in their situation, they steal what they must, and only what they must, to survive, but generally try to lead as legitimate and \"normal\" a life as possible (albeit one fraught with danger and which could be cut short at any time), if only so that no one can say they owe anything to society as a whole. Th ey look aft er each other and their own business.

Th e information he had gathered—watch schedules, rivalries, fears—meant his plan went off  without a hitch. Aft er tonight, Th e Vipers would never take out another bounty on him. Last night was hard, but by sunrise twelve of the highest ranking members of the group lay dead. Aelar had used their own techniques against them, making it look like old rivalries had fl ared, or treacherous deals had been made. Come the morning the bodies were discovered, and the entire gang dissolved into infi ghting factions. Th ose that weren't killed were now in chains and would doubtless face the hangman. Now there were just a few loose ends to clear up.

Th e chief had taken the fi rst watch, staring slumped into the campfi re. Aelar nocked an arrow and drew back the string but, just as he leveled his aim, the chief's face hardened with a sudden resolve. Slowly, he got to his feet, a fl ash of fi re at his belt as his knife left  its sheath. Aelar held his breath, but he was seemingly not the chief's target. Instead, he moved towards his sleeping men, clearly meaning to put to rest any suspicion in his mind that they would turn on him as the others had.": "整个晚上，Aelar都在跟踪他们，现在他们停下来扎营，他有了机会。酋长站在第一个岗哨上，呆呆地看着营火。艾拉尔给箭上了弦，拉开了弦，但就在他瞄准的时候，酋长的脸突然变得坚毅起来。慢慢地，他站了起来，刀子离开刀鞘的时候，他的腰带上有一束火。艾拉尔屏住呼吸，但他似乎不是酋长的目标。相反，他走向他沉睡的手下，显然是为了平息他心中的疑虑，即他们会像其他人一样背叛他。",
	"Aelar loosed the arrow; the chief grunted as it pierced his chest, and he sank to his knees.

	"Aticus' parents were against his leaving, forbidding it, which only made Aticus want to leave even more. He left  one night through his bedroom window, taking with him only a few items, most importantly, his grandfather's flute.

Of course he doesn't always know or remember every detail when he comes to retell them, so he often shifts the topic of the conversation to himself, or an experience that he had, or merges them with other stories that he heard second hand. Th is is not out of selfishness, but rather a desire to entertain people.

	"Once a hunter and trapper selling furs and game, Mal began his criminal career by accident—he was falsely accused of murder shortly after entering a foreign city. While awaiting his turn at the gallows, he shared a jail cell with two members of a local thieves guild. Although they spoke the common tongue to him, they spoke to one another in a strange language. The night before they were to be executed, Mal was suddenly roused from sleep. His cell mates were conspiring. When they noticed he was awake they motioned for him to stay silent. They spoke in whispers, \"How much do you want to live?\" ": "马尔曾经是一个出售毛皮和野味的猎人和捕猎者，他的犯罪生涯开始于一个意外，他在进入一个外国城市后不久就被错误地指控为谋杀。在等待轮到他上绞架时，他与当地盗贼公会的两名成员同住一个牢房。虽然他们对他说普通话，但他们彼此之间却用一种奇怪的语言交谈。在他们被处决的前一天晚上，马尔突然从睡梦中被叫醒。他的狱友们正在密谋。当他们注意到他醒了之后，他们示意他保持沉默。他们低声说：\"你想活多久？",
	"Mal became suddenly frightened, thinking these thieves meant to slit his throat. He was, however, mistaken. Th ey explained that their guild brothers would be unlocking their cell shortly, and, if he so desired, he could go free as well. He was skeptical but desperate. Sure enough, minutes later, the light from a guard's oil lamp came through the small barred window in the cell door. A hushed voice echoed in the chamber just outside and one of the thieves in Mal's cell answered. Th e key in the lock chattered. It was now or never and Mal's cell mates didn't waste time.": "马尔突然变得很害怕，以为这些盗贼是要割断他的喉咙。然而，他错了。他们解释说，他们的公会兄弟很快就会打开他们的牢房，而且，如果他愿意，他也可以获得自由。他很怀疑，但很绝望。果然，几分钟后，一个守卫的油灯的光亮从牢房门上的小铁窗里透出来。一个沙哑的声音在外面的房间里回荡，马尔的牢房里的一个小偷回答说。钥匙在锁里颤抖着。机不可失，时不再来，马尔的狱友们没有浪费时间。",
	"On the floor just outside his cell door there sat an oil lamp and a key ring. Mal knelt down to take them, but when he looked up again, the thieves were gone. He was on his own. ": "在他牢房门外的地板上，放着一盏油灯和一个钥匙圈。马尔跪下来取，但当他再次抬头时，小偷已经走了。他只能靠自己了。",
	"He crept slowly, but not very quietly, through the network of hallways and passages for several tense minutes, trying to recall the exact route that he was brought days earlier. It was hard to remember as he had been badly beaten by the city guard during his arrest, then again as he was brought to the prison and questioned. He thought about slitting the throats of every guard he might meet but, surprisingly, there were none on patrol. The thieves and their guild mates' work, he thought. ": "他慢慢地，但不是很安静地，在走廊和通道的网络中爬行了几分钟，试图回忆起几天前他被带来的确切路线。这很难记住，因为他在被捕时被城市卫兵狠狠地打了一顿，然后又被带到监狱里接受审问。他想过割断他可能遇到的每个警卫的喉咙，但令人惊讶的是，没有人在巡逻。他想，这是盗贼和他们公会伙伴的工作。",
	"Suddenly he rounded a corner, and there was the flickering of fi relight. He crept closer as quietly as he could, discovering one of many guard rooms.

Mal approached cautiously to find that all of the guards had been slain with a single slice to the throat. ": "突然，他绕过一个角落，有火苗的闪烁声。他尽可能地悄悄靠近，发现了许多警卫室中的一个。里面有几个卫兵躺在床铺上，或围坐在房间中间的火堆旁，但除了渐渐熄灭的火堆的噼啪声，没有任何声音。茉儿小心翼翼地走近，发现所有的卫兵都被一刀砍死了。",

The other two began to turn out his pockets. He struggled until a swift  punch to the stomach doubled him over. One of them ripped the lute from his hands, breaking the shoulder strap.

All share an uneasy truce at their headquarters, each of them knowing that any other of them could have a knife to their throat on the next job, and that as each job goes by, the blades are only getting sharper. {@creature Yrla Silverhand|Skul} (p.186) leads the Blades, inspired by the traumatic incidents of her past; she's a shrewd businesswoman, keeping work steady, and having the history, skills, and charisma to keep her 'boys' in check and her word above contestation. She takes sadistic amusement in predicting the outcomes of every job, and every rivalry, she orchestrates. ": "刺客是贪婪的。刺客是无情的。刺客们对自己的能力有十足的自信。将这些特点发挥到极致，你就会发现 \"双刃剑\"。这是一种优雅的直截了当的方法--每个任务都有两名刺客，每个人都有两个目标：首先是目标，其次是其他刺客。有些人觊觎财富；为其他行会工作所能赚取的近乎双倍的承诺吸引着他们。有些人渴望尊严；\"刺客中的刺客 \"是一个值得为之冒险的称谓。有些人......嗯，有些人只是嗜血的狂人。所有的人都在他们的总部共享一个不安的休战，他们每个人都知道，他们中的任何一个人都可能在下一次工作中被刀架在喉咙上，而随着每一次工作的进行，刀刃只会越来越锋利。{@creature Yrla Silverhand|Skul}(p.186)领导刀锋战士，受到她过去的创伤性事件的启发；她是一个精明的商人，保持工作稳定，并且有历史、技能和魅力，使她的 \"孩子们 \"受到控制，她的话不被质疑。她以预测每项工作和每场竞争的结果为虐心的乐趣。",
	"Always fascinated, always reading, always learning; Nimh was forever asking questions, fi nding out how and why things worked, even as a child. Th e arthritic dog of a neighbor mysteriously disappeared one day and was found cut into neat pieces in the temple grounds next to Nimh's house. She had just wanted to know why it was broken and if it could be fi xed. Th e fi nal straw came as a teenager, when she 'fi xed' the pneumonia of the farmer's prize sheep by transplanting into it the lungs of his carthorse. Th e townsfolk hid their children and animals as she made her way to the road. ": "尼姆总是很着迷，总是在阅读，总是在学习；尼姆永远在问问题，找出事情的原理和原因，甚至在小时候也是如此。有一天，邻居的一只关节炎狗神秘地失踪了，人们在尼姆家旁边的寺庙里发现它被切成整齐的碎片。她只是想知道它为什么会坏掉，以及它是否能被修复。最后一根稻草是在她十几岁的时候出现的，当时她把农夫的获奖羊的肺移植到了羊身上，从而 \"治愈 \"了它的肺炎。当她走到路上时，乡亲们把他们的孩子和动物都藏了起来。",
	"She moved to a town where nobody knew of her peculiarities and trained as an apothecary, keeping her unusual 'hobbies' to herself. Her intensive study turned her into an accomplished alchemist; observing the eff ects of elixirs on living things mesmerized her. Not satisfi ed with simply viewing their external eff ects, waifs and strays both human and animal oft en found themselves invited in out of the cold, then strapped to a table in her tiny backroom, fl esh and muscle neatly clipped back to reveal their inner workings. If they were lucky, Nimh would let them die fi rst.": "她搬到了一个没有人知道她的特殊性的小镇，并接受了药剂师的培训，把她不寻常的 \"爱好 \"留给自己。她的深入研究使她成为一名出色的炼金术士；观察灵药对生物的效果使她着迷。她并不满足于简单地观看它们的外部效果，人类和动物的流浪者经常发现自己被邀请到寒冷的地方，然后被绑在她狭小的密室里的桌子上，皮肤和肌肉被整齐地剪下来，露出它们的内部结构。如果他们幸运的话，尼姆会让他们先死。",
	"Completely ruthless and clinical, she had no reservations whatsoever when mortal representatives of the Demon Lord of the Affl  icted appeared to her and off ered her knowledge beyond measure in exchange for what's left  of those who perish on her table. To increase her body count, she now moonlights as a backstreet surgeon, mostly for the less savory characters of the town, and can easily be persuaded to facilitate a 'tragic complication' if her patron would prefer the patient not make a full recovery. Aft er all, the necromancers get what they want and Nimh can start a new 'side-project'... ": "她完全无情，而且很有临床经验，当恶魔领主的凡人代表出现在她面前时，她毫无保留地提供了她的知识，以换取那些在她桌子上死去的人的遗物。为了增加她的尸体数量，她现在兼职当起了街边的外科医生，主要是为镇上不那么好的人物服务，如果她的主顾希望病人不能完全康复，她可以很容易地被说服，促成一个 \"悲剧性的并发症\"。最后，死灵法师们得到了他们想要的东西，尼姆也可以开始一个新的 \"副业\"......",
	"\"Have you tried saying 'no' to that man? Let me know how it turns out for you.\" He will follow orders even if he thinks they're wrong.
