	"But most often, he is in disguise. Persona is perhaps the greatest performer that has ever lived; he can inhabit a role so completely as to fool the friends and families of the people he impersonates, which has allowed him to pull off truly incredible robberies and assassinations.

	"Goril acts more as a force of nature than a conventional villain. He's perhaps best employed as the cause of a great blight which ravages the land, or one specific forest, like the living embodiment of disease. Goril doesn't plan or lay elaborate traps, he just exists to spread the Waste.": "戈利尔更多的是作为一种自然力量而不是传统的反派。他也许最适合作为蹂躏土地或特定森林的大瘟疫的原因，就像疾病的活生生的化身。戈利尔并不计划或布置精心设计的陷阱，他只是为了传播废物而存在。",
	"When Goril is introduced, be sure to play up precisely how repulsive he is. Appearing more like a conglomeration of filth and tar than a humanoid creature, he leaves a trail of sludge in his waste. When he speaks, the voice comes from a stream of bubbles that surge to the surface around his body, distorting his voice into a sickening cacophony.": "当介绍Goril时，一定要准确地渲染他是多么令人厌恶。与其说他是一个人形生物，不如说他更像一个污垢和焦油的集合体，他的废物中留下了一串污泥。当他说话时，声音来自他身体周围涌出的气泡流，将他的声音扭曲成令人作呕的喧嚣声。",
	"Once, a long time ago, Goril was an elf, and stood alongside the Circle of the Green, protecting the natural world from corruption. Because of his talent and ambition, Goril was called by the Parliament of Trees to serve as a Green Knight, the highest honor an elf could receive. He rose through the ranks and was eventually appointed the Verdant Captain, leader of the knights. As captain, he argued with the Parliament daily, urging them to let him strike out at the forces of corruption, rather than merely defending the forests from intruders. The Parliament denied him without fail.": "很久以前，戈里尔是一个精灵，他与绿圈站在一起，保护自然界免遭腐败。由于他的天赋和野心，戈利尔被树之议会召为绿色骑士，这是一个精灵可以获得的最高荣誉。他不断晋升，最终被任命为绿化队长，成为骑士的领袖。作为队长，他每天都与议会争论，敦促他们让他对腐败势力进行打击，而不仅仅是保卫森林免受入侵者的侵害。议会毫无例外地拒绝了他。",
	"Finally, Goril became impatient, and led a group into the Waste, where the Green Knights never venture. There, he found no terrible beasts or masses of sprawling corruption, but an endless, desolate plain, devoid of all life. As his knights began to perish from heat and thirst, something possessed Goril, and he turned on his brothers, slaying all who still stood.": "最后，戈利尔变得不耐烦了，他带领一群人进入了绿色骑士从不涉足的荒地。在那里，他没有发现可怕的野兽或大量的蔓延的腐败，而是一个无尽的、荒凉的平原，没有任何生命。当他的骑士们开始因炎热和干渴而死亡时，有什么东西占据了戈利尔，他转向他的兄弟们，杀死了所有仍然站立的人。",
	"When Goril returned to the Parliament, he carried inside of him a bit of the Waste, a malignant tumor of desolation, which he placed in the center of the forest. Life around it perished and become blighted, permanently destroying the Parliament of Trees and all the sacred groves. Gradually, Goril began to appear like the rot; festering, rotting, and steeped in corruption. Other elves fled the forest, and spat Goril's name, calling him the Lord of Maggots, and the King of Rot.": "当戈利尔回到议会时，他在体内携带了一点废物，一个荒凉的恶性肿瘤，他把它放在森林的中心。它周围的生命灭亡并变得枯萎，永久地摧毁了树木议会和所有神圣的丛林。渐渐地，戈里尔开始像腐烂一样出现；溃烂，腐烂，沉浸在腐败之中。其他精灵逃离了森林，并唾弃戈利尔的名字，称他为蛆虫之主和腐烂之王。",
	"Goril is followed by a pair of corrupted dire wolves (use Dire Wolf stats) that pounce on any living thing that comes into Goril's wake. Because Goril steadily transforms the landscape around him, the party is sure to fight him in difficult terrain, rife with hazards.": "戈利尔身后有一对被腐蚀的地狼（使用地狼属性），它们会扑向任何进入戈利尔身后的活物。由于戈瑞尔会不断地改变他周围的地形，因此党派肯定会在困难的地形中与他战斗，充满了危险性。",

": "罗丁是一个危险的单打独斗者，在需要一个背景反派来骚扰玩家，然后逃之夭夭的战役中是一个有用的工具。如果他面对的是比他的挑战等级低得多的一方，那么他的威慑力就会大得多，这是需要考虑的，因为罗丁总是单独作战。",
	"There's a great deal of mystery in Roldin's backstory, which the players will have to learn to before defeating him once and for all. How did Roldin really get trapped in the Plane of Shadow, how did he survive, and how did he return? Is Roldin acting alone, or at the behest of a more powerful entity? The only people that know the answers to these questions were the knights of Roldin's past, now old men, and being picked off one at a time by the vengeful knight.": "罗丹的背景故事有很大的神秘性，在彻底打败他之前，玩家们必须了解到这一点。罗丁到底是如何被困在阴影之界的，他是如何生存下来的，又是如何回来的？罗丹是单独行动，还是受一个更强大的实体的指使？唯一知道这些问题答案的是罗尔丁过去的骑士，他们现在已经老了，正在被复仇的骑士一个个挑走。",

	"Roldin was a young knight when the Long Night began. The sun simply never rose, and the land fell into chaos, as sinister creatures from under the earth arose to terrorize the surface.

": "长夜开始时，罗丁还是个年轻的骑士。太阳根本没有升起，土地陷入混乱，来自地底的邪恶生物开始恐吓地面。一支强大的骑士队伍被召集起来，以恢复秩序和大地的光明。罗丹和他的导师，勇敢的凯斯特一样，也被算作他们中的一员。",
	"Eventually, the band of knights found the source of the darkness, a decrepit mage's tower, swarming with living shadows. Somehow, the tower's resident had haphazardly opened a portal to the Plane of Shadow, which spiraled out of control, consumed the top floor of the tower, and caused an endless night.": "最终，这群骑士找到了黑暗的源头，一座破旧的法师塔，里面有很多活生生的影子。不知何故，塔里的居民胡乱地打开了一个通往阴影界的入口，它失去了控制，吞噬了塔的顶层，并导致了无尽的黑夜。",
	"The knights battled their way to the source of the disaster, slaying shadows as they went, but when they at last arrived, only Roldin and Kester still stood. As Kester tells it, both fought valiantly, but the void closed around Roldin, trapping him within. The other knights were revived, and given a hero's welcome upon returning home, but Roldin was never seen again. At least, that is, until a few weeks ago. ": "骑士们一路战斗到灾难的源头，边走边杀戮阴影，但当他们最后到达时，只有罗丁和凯斯特还站着。据凯斯特说，两人都在英勇战斗，但虚空包围了罗丁，把他困在里面。其他骑士被救活了，回家后受到了英雄般的欢迎，但罗丹却再也没有出现。至少，在几周前是这样。",
	"A knight in jet-black armor wielding Roldin's sword appeared out of thin air in the king's palace, slew Kester the Brave, and vanished just as quickly. Perhaps, the Black Knight only seeks revenge against the knights that once led him to the ill-fated tower, or perhaps he seeks to bring the Long Night again.": "一个身穿漆黑盔甲的骑士挥舞着罗丁的剑，凭空出现在国王的宫殿里，杀死了勇者凯斯特，然后同样迅速地消失了。也许，黑骑士只是为了向曾经带领他进入命运多舛的塔楼的骑士们复仇，也许他是为了再次带来长夜。",
	"Roldin makes liberal use of his ability to become invisible at will, and prefers to strike unseen, and vanish quickly when his foe is slain.

	"Ki Vampires are known across the east, and are feared far more than any other type of undead, for while other undead lose their identities entirely, the Jiangshi persist as they were, with a deadly intelligence, and a lifetime of martial arts skill.

	"Siddhartha traveled to the east from a far off land, over the mountains to trade spices and silks for gold. When his stocks were sold, and his coffers full, he intended to return home, but was ambushed on the road by ruthless bandits. Siddhartha was a generous man, and offered the men half his gold, a small fortune, if he could carry on safely to his homeland, but the bandits refused. Throwing him from his cart, the bandits took all he had, then broke both his legs and left him to die.": "释迦牟尼从遥远的地方来到东方，翻山越岭，用香料和丝绸换取黄金。当他的存货卖完了，库房也满了，他打算回家，但在路上被无情的强盗伏击。释迦牟尼是个慷慨的人，他把自己一半的黄金给了这些人，这是一笔小小的财富，如果他能安全地回到自己的家乡，但土匪们拒绝了。匪徒把他从车上扔下来，拿走了他所有的东西，然后打断他的双腿，让他自生自灭。",
	"A day passed, and Siddhartha saw no one else upon the road, but watched a small, persistent light flicked high up in the mountains nearby. With heroic strength, the next morning he bound his legs with bamboo, and crawled up the mountain to find help.

	"Siddhartha stayed with the monks for a year and a day, learning all they had to teach him, but held inside him a seething hate for those who had assaulted him on the road.

In a rage, he killed everyone he found there, embracing the darkness within himself, and shunning balance with his ki.": "释迦牟尼在僧侣们那里呆了一年零一天，学习了他们要教给他的一切，但他内心对那些在路上袭击他的人充满了仇恨。当他终于可以走路时，尽管腿很僵硬，他还是离开了寺院，找到了强盗的藏身处。在愤怒中，他杀死了他在那里发现的每一个人，拥抱自己内心的黑暗，回避与他的气的平衡。",

	"The most terrifying aspect of Ransom is that he might be right on some level. As the GM, you have the final say on this, but casting some doubt on the gods themselves puts Ransom, the Defiants, and the entire campaign world in a very different light.

	"But one day, while Ransom investigated a far corner of his king's domain for threats, he discovered something buried in a famer's field. The object had clearly fallen from the sky, and the moment Ransom laid his eyes on it, he forsook his gods, his oaths, and the very order of the universe. No one today knows what Ransom found, other than that it is irrefutable evidence that the gods are false, and so too may be the universe itself.": "但是有一天，当兰森在他的国王的领地的一个遥远的角落调查威胁时，他发现了一个埋在农夫的田里的东西。这个东西显然是从天上掉下来的，当兰瑟姆看到它的那一刻，他抛弃了他的神，他的誓言，以及宇宙的秩序。今天没有人知道兰瑟姆发现了什么，只知道它是无可辩驳的证据，证明神是假的，宇宙本身也可能是假的。",
	"Ransom founded the Defiants, an organization of atheists, dedicated to destroying all faiths from their foundations.

	"{@b The Icosahedron}. Ransom saw this artifact fall from the sky, and from beyond the sky. For an instant, he saw the edge of a Great Table, and immense legs of chairs, and understood that the beings above it all were not gods at all.

When it placed on the ground with one side facing up, those around it can feel the shifting of reality and the pull of fate. Some symbols are more powerful than others, for weal and for woe.": "{@b The Icosahedron}. 兰瑟姆看到这件神器从天而降，又从天外而降。一瞬间，他看到了一张大桌子的边缘，和巨大的椅子腿，并明白这一切上面的生命根本不是神。二十面体，一个令人惊讶的密集的20面体，大约一英尺宽，每个面上都刻有奇怪的符号。当它放在地上，一面朝上时，周围的人可以感受到现实的转变和命运的牵引。有些符号比其他符号更有力量，有好处也有坏处。",

	"Ransom has two goals for the icosahedron, which stem from his belief in justice and law: he wishes to return it to The Table from whence it came, and he wishes to use it to destroy the universe. The universe is false, a creation of the un-divine, and should be ended. Simultaneously, the Icosahedron belongs to the creators, and should be returned, that all things should be equal when it is over. Nothing else truly matters to him.": "兰森对二十面体有两个目标，这源于他对正义和法律的信仰：他希望把它送回桌子，因为它是从那里来的；他希望用它来摧毁宇宙。宇宙是虚假的，是非神的创造，应该被终结。同时，二十面体属于创造者，应该被归还，当它结束时，所有东西都应该是平等的。对他来说，其他事情都不重要。",

	"Virgil is a dark, mysterious character, and is great for campaigns which will eventually take place in the Hells, or one that needs a villain with a truly suicidal plot. Virgil, after all, has plenty of motivation to incite an epic disaster, as long as it is apocalyptic enough to completely destroy his immortal soul. He can also be a fun addition after the party comes across an artifact, since he might have reason to hunt them to secure it for himself.": "维吉尔是一个黑暗、神秘的角色，非常适合最终发生在地狱的战役，或者需要一个真正有自杀情节的反派。毕竟，维吉尔有足够的动机来煽动一场史诗般的灾难，只要这场灾难足以彻底摧毁他不朽的灵魂。他也可以在党派遇到文物后成为一个有趣的补充，因为他可能有理由猎杀他们，为自己争取文物。",
	"Players can interact indirectly with Virgil through his writings on the Hells, as it plays a direct parallel to the real-world text Dante's Inferno. In his origin story, Virgil plays the part of Dante and himself, and walked through Hell for reasons now forgotten. He's a living character of legend, and emphasizing this can make for an imposing, memorable presence.": "玩家可以通过维吉尔关于地狱的著作间接地与他互动，因为它与现实世界的文本但丁的《地狱》直接平行。在他的起源故事中，维吉尔扮演着但丁和他自己的角色，并因为现在被遗忘的原因而走过地狱。他是一个活生生的传奇人物，强调这一点可以使他成为一个有气势的、令人难忘的存在。",
	"When you stare long into the abyss, the abyss stares back.": "当你长时间盯着深渊时，深渊也会回瞪你。",
	"Virgil walked the depths of the Nine Hells centuries ago, but he, in his unnaturally long life, is still stained by its black influence. He penned his travels as he walked, and returned with his writings to the mortal world, and because of him, many scholars today know the torments that wait in the Hells. His writings detailed the different layers of the Hells, the types of devils roam its underbelly, and the names of the archdukes that reign on each layer. But Virgil's travels were not without cost.": "几个世纪前，维吉尔在九层地狱的深处行走，但他，在他不自然的长寿中，仍然被九层地狱的黑色影响所玷污。他边走边写，带着他的著作回到了凡间，因为他的缘故，今天很多学者都知道在地狱里等待的折磨。他的著作详细介绍了地狱的不同层次，游荡在地狱底层的魔鬼类型，以及在每一层统治的大公的名字。但维吉尔的旅行并非没有代价。",
	"Today, Virgil is himself a cross between a devil and a wraith himself. His body is still mortal, stuck in a halfway point between life and death, requiring him to drain the life force of the living to persist in the world.": "今天，维吉尔本人就是一个介于魔鬼和裹尸布之间的人。他的身体仍然是凡人，卡在生与死之间的半路上，需要他耗费生者的生命力来坚持在这个世界上。",
	"Virgil is terrified of death, in spite of being a specter of death himself. He knows full well what evil awaits him in the afterlife, and so searches endlessly for an escape from his fate. Somewhere, he hoards scraps of ancient knowledge, and fragments of magical artifacts. His ultimate goal is to discover an artifact or ritual that can grant him an audience with the gods themselves, to beg for forgiveness and ask for entry into the higher planes. Failing that, Virgil looks for something powerful enough to destroy his soul, regardless of the collateral damage. Destroying the world would be acceptable to him, if he can avoid a return to the underworld in the process.": "维吉尔对死亡感到恐惧，尽管他自己就是一个死亡的幽灵。他清楚地知道在来世等待他的是什么邪恶，因此无休止地寻找逃脱命运的方法。在某处，他囤积了古代知识的碎片和魔法文物的碎片。他的最终目标是发现一件可以让他觐见诸神的神器或仪式，以乞求宽恕并要求进入更高的层面。如果做不到这一点，维吉尔就会寻找足够强大的东西来摧毁他的灵魂，而不顾附带的损害。毁灭世界对他来说是可以接受的，如果他能在这个过程中避免回到冥界的话。",
	"To many, his name is not that of a scholar, but that of a folk legend -- a moral tale warning children against the draw of evil things.

	"To secure his escape, Virgil may summon devils as a distraction. He never fights alongside the summoned devils, for he fears devils more than any living thing.": "为了确保逃跑，维吉尔可以召唤魔鬼来分散注意力。他从不与被召唤的魔鬼并肩作战，因为他对魔鬼的恐惧超过任何生物。",

	"The Pale Man is a terrifying figure that most comic fans should recognize instinctively, (in spite of the fact that the character here is original, and any resemblance to any other figure, real or fictional, is purely coincidental.)

Healthy, that is, except for the smiling grimace frozen across his face and his unnaturally white, almost bleached skin.

	"His tools of choice are gadgets and gas. The Pale Man has some experience with alchemy and tinkering, and loves to distort the tropes and gags of court jesters into tools of destruction. He's best known for laughing gas bombs, which provide a lethal punchline for his jokes, though he also employs lightning handshake buzzers and acidic flowers. If all else fails, he is extremely proficient with daggers, shortswords, rapiers, and other blades, and can end a confrontation swiftly if his jokes fall flat.": "他选择的工具是小玩意和气体。苍白者在炼金术和修补方面有一些经验，他喜欢把宫廷小丑的陈词滥调和插科打诨扭曲成破坏工具。他最出名的是笑气炸弹，这为他的笑话提供了一个致命的笑料，尽管他也采用了闪电式握手器和酸性花朵。如果一切都失败了，他非常精通匕首、短剑、轻剑和其他兵器，如果他的笑话落空，他可以迅速结束一场对抗。",

	"Patia is a walking revenge story, with an entire undead horde at her back. She fits well into campaigns which feature massive, destructive undead hordes, as easily as she fits into those that favor inquisitive detective work, since one of the easiest ways to dispatch her is to unravel her past, and ensure that her vengeance is sated. Battling her and her horde directly is a challenge fit for a high-level party, while capturing Fax can be accomplished by a low level one.": "帕蒂亚是一个行走的复仇故事，她的背后有一整个亡灵部落。她很适合那些以大规模、毁灭性的亡灵群为特征的战役，也很容易适合那些喜欢探究的侦探工作的战役，因为派遣她的一个最简单的方法就是解开她的过去，并确保她的复仇得到满足。直接与她和她的部落作战是一个适合高级别团队的挑战，而捕获传真则可以由低级别团队完成。",

	"Revenants rise when someone who meets a cruel and unjust death is given a rare second chance for vengeance. Lady Patia was a beautiful commoner turned wife of a nobleman, quite against her will. Her husband was Barnum Fax, a despotic nobleman who governed many estates in the East on behalf of the king and was infamous for his mistreatment for his property, including his servants, employees, and wives. However it was that Patia died, it was certainly by his hand, and was so savage that no one that witnessed it dare repeat its details. One year later, Patia's grave was found empty, dug up from the inside.": "当一个遭遇残酷和不公正的死亡的人被给予罕见的第二次复仇机会时，亡灵就会出现。帕蒂亚女士是一个美丽的平民，在违背自己意愿的情况下，成为了一个贵族的妻子。她的丈夫是巴纳姆-传真，一个专制的贵族，代表国王管理东方的许多庄园，因虐待他的财产，包括他的仆人、雇员和妻子而臭名昭著。不管帕蒂亚是怎么死的，肯定是死于他的手，而且是如此的野蛮，以至于目睹的人都不敢重复其细节。一年后，帕蒂亚的坟墓被发现是空的，从里面挖出来的。",
	"Patia is now a revenant and found that she was gifted with the Deathsign, a mark of undeath that can raise and contract the dead into service. She quickly raised an army of corpses and overran Fax's estates, forcing him to flee westward.

Over a year has passed, and yet Patia the Pale, as she has come to be known, clings to undeath, indicating that she is a revenant of the rarest variety, one gifted with a decade to seek vengeance against those who wronged her.

It exchanges its hosts often, every few years in the best of circumstances, for it gradually drains and withers its host, leaving them no more than a husk.": "对大多数人来说，X不过是一个神话，因为它几乎从未在其当前的宿主之外出现。它经常交换宿主，在最好的情况下每隔几年就交换一次，因为它逐渐耗尽并使宿主枯萎，只剩下一具躯壳。",
	"When its host is spent, it makes a rare exposed trek to find a new one. It grapples a prospective host in its tendrils, then burrows into its body, taking up residence in the space between the host's body cavities. Once inside, it generally does one of three things: it can choose to negotiate with its host, offering magic and power, it can coerce its host by wreaking immense pain on its body, or it can simply kill the host and use its corpse as a puppet for a short while, until it begins to rot. One can track the parasite's travels by following a string of desiccated corpses and grisly murders.": "当它的宿主被耗尽时，它就会进行罕见的暴露式跋涉，去寻找一个新的宿主。它用卷须抓住一个潜在的宿主，然后钻进它的身体，在宿主的体腔之间的空间里居住。一旦进入，它通常会做三件事中的一件：它可以选择与宿主谈判，提供魔法和力量；它可以通过在宿主身上制造巨大的痛苦来胁迫宿主；或者它可以简单地杀死宿主，将其尸体作为傀儡使用一小段时间，直到它开始腐烂。人们可以通过跟踪一串干枯的尸体和可怕的谋杀案来追踪寄生虫的行程。",
	"To its hosts that accept it willingly, X can grant a pact, empowering its host with powerful magic as a warlock. In exchange, the host merely has to follow the parasite's telepathic commands, and allow the parasite to live within it. This pact is a deeply attractive offer, but comes with the eventual cost of the hosts own life, for the more magic the host uses, the greater toll the parasite takes on its system.": "对于自愿接受它的宿主，X可以授予一个契约，赋予其宿主作为术士的强大魔法。作为交换，宿主只需听从寄生虫的心灵感应命令，并允许寄生虫在其体内生活。这个契约是一个非常有吸引力的提议，但最终要以宿主自己的生命为代价，因为宿主使用的魔法越多，寄生虫对其系统的伤害就越大。",
	"X is deeply secretive with its goals on this planet. Perhaps, it is an advance scout, the first invader before an armada arrives.

	"Faust's story is a tragic one, that of a brilliant man trying to best fate. When he was still an apprentice wizard, Faust married young, and was deliriously happy (as young people are) but by the time he was mere months from becoming a Master of the Conjuration school, something was wrong. His wife developed a cough, and began to lose the feeling in her fingers. She eventually bore him a daughter, but perished in childbirth, and the child was born very ill. Clerics, healers, and other wizards visited in turn, but none could do anything to alleviate the sickness.": "浮士德的故事是一个悲剧性的故事，是一个试图战胜命运的杰出人物的故事。当浮士德还是个巫师学徒的时候，他很年轻就结婚了，而且幸福得不得了（就像年轻人一样），但是当他只差几个月就能成为咒语学校的大师时，事情就不对劲了。他的妻子患上了咳嗽，并且开始失去手指的感觉。她最终为他生了一个女儿，但在分娩时丧生，孩子出生时病得很重。牧师、治疗师和其他巫师依次来访，但没有人能够缓解这种疾病。",
	"Faust, in his desperation, sought a solution from more powerful forces. He knew that if the gods would not help, the devils below would. But rather than summon one to the Material Plane to negotiate with, Faust chose a more daring option: with a dark ritual, he traveled alone to the Nine Hells and sought out a devil named the Advocate. Because he met the Advocate on his terms, he thought he could negotiate a better deal from the fiend, and perhaps could save his child from death. The Advocate suspended time in his domain, and negotiated with Faust for years. The two eventually came to an agreement that Faust believed to be free of any loopholes or disadvantages. He was wrong.": "浮士德在绝望中，从更强大的力量中寻求解决办法。他知道，如果诸神不帮忙，下面的魔鬼会帮忙。但浮士德没有召唤一个人到物质界来谈判，而是选择了一个更大胆的选择：通过一个黑暗的仪式，他独自前往九层地狱，寻找一个名叫代言人的魔鬼。因为他以自己的条件见到了代言人，他认为他可以从这个魔鬼那里谈成一个更好的交易，也许可以把他的孩子从死亡中救出来。提倡者在他的领域里暂停了时间，与浮士德谈判了好几年。两人最终达成了一项协议，浮士德认为该协议没有任何漏洞或不利因素。他错了。",

Another was an imp familiar to assist him in his schemes.": "浮士德回到凡间不是作为一个巫师，而是作为一个参议员，是这个国家最有权力的人之一。这只是浮士德讨价还价后获得的众多好处之一。另一个好处是有一个熟悉的小恶魔来协助他的计划。",
	"To complete his bargain with the Advocate, Faust must complete three monstrous tasks from his seat as senator. First, Faust must have the king assassinated by a profane dagger, and ensure that his brother, a wicked servant of the Advocate, would ascend to the throne. Second, he must cause a great disaster within the nation, one that shall cost thousands of innocent lives in the Advocate's name. Lastly, he must open a gate to the Advocate's domain in the Nine Hells, allowing innumerable devils to stream forth into the mortal realm. Only then will Faust be able to remedy his child.": "为了完成他与辩护人的交易，浮士德必须在他的参议员席位上完成三项可怕的任务。首先，浮士德必须用一把虔诚的匕首刺杀国王，并确保他的弟弟，一个代言人的邪恶仆人，能够登上王位。其次，他必须在国内造成一场巨大的灾难，这场灾难将以代言人的名义使成千上万的无辜者丧生。最后，他必须在九层地狱打开一扇通往代言人领域的大门，让无数的魔鬼涌入凡间。只有这样，浮士德才能够补救他的孩子。",
	"Faust is a very difficult enemy to attack in part because he's a powerful government official. He takes great care to disguise his malicious activity, so that any actions against him seem unjustified, illegal, and treasonous. In public, he is never far from a small detachment of well-trained guards, (NPC veterans) and even at home, a pair of personal guards are never out of earshot.": "浮士德是一个非常难以攻击的敌人，部分原因是他是一个强大的政府官员。他非常注意掩饰自己的恶意活动，因此任何针对他的行动都显得毫无道理、非法和叛国。在公共场合，他从不远离一小队训练有素的卫兵，（NPC老兵），即使在家里，也有一对私人卫兵不离耳。",
	"But these protectors are nothing compared to the infernal allies that Faust can call upon. His work is deemed very important by the Advocate, and so a host of devils are automatically summoned to his location whenever Faust would prove to be in mortal danger. Of course, he makes good to never allow his infernal friends to expose him, so he rarely summons them in public places, unless the situation is truly dire or he is confident that he can deal with all the witnesses.": "但这些保护者与浮士德可以召唤的地狱盟友相比，就显得微不足道了。他的工作被代言人认为是非常重要的，所以只要浮士德被证明有致命的危险，就会自动召唤一大批魔鬼到他那里。当然，他做好了绝不让他的地狱朋友暴露他的身份，所以他很少在公共场所召唤他们，除非情况真的很危急，或者他有信心能处理好所有的证人。",
	"You have long considered that power is most often profane. Vile fiends, which reside in eternal pits of flame outside the mortal realm, wield power that puts the works of mortal men to shame.

Through intense study of obscure summoning and binding rituals, you've reached out to the Lower Planes and have contacted a fiend yourself, not to parlay with, but to command.": "你长期以来一直认为，权力往往是亵渎的。卑鄙的魔鬼，居住在凡人领域之外的永恒的火焰坑中，拥有的力量让凡人的作品感到羞愧。然而，他们无疑是邪恶的，甚至与他们进行交易都是值得诅咒的。通过对晦涩难懂的召唤和捆绑仪式的深入研究，你已经接触到了下层世界，并且自己也接触到了一个恶魔，不是为了与之谈判，而是为了指挥。",
