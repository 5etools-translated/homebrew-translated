	"The Illusionist's Ball is a deadly game of creativity and deception played between two or more spellcasters who favor illusion and enchantment magic. Usually, this game is played in secret. For each spellcaster that participates, three or more bystanders will also be involved in the game.": "幻术师之球是一个致命的创造力和欺骗的游戏，在两个或更多偏爱幻术和魔法的施法者之间进行。通常情况下，这个游戏是秘密进行的。每一个参与的施法者，三个或更多的旁观者也会参与到游戏中。",
	"The game takes place at a ball, or some other social gathering, such as a banquet, a dance, or a wedding. Each spellcaster must disguise themselves using illusion magic (the most common spell for this is disguise self) and also create an illusory person, called a Fake, to inhabit the ball. Illusory people are controlled by the DM, but their actions and response must be loosely dictated by the player that created them in advance. Each player is allowed five sentences of description for their illusory character.": "游戏发生在一个舞会上，或其他一些社交聚会，如宴会、舞会或婚礼上。每个施法者都必须使用幻觉魔法来伪装自己（最常见的咒语是伪装自己），同时创造一个虚幻的人，称为 \"假人\"，在舞会上居住。虚幻的人由DM控制，但他们的行动和反应必须由创造他们的玩家事先松散地支配。每个玩家可以为他们的虚幻人物描述五句话。",
	"The goal of game is to find and stealthily kill all of the other players' Fakes (a Fake vanishes upon death), while keeping your Fake undiscovered. Killing a bystander or a player is grounds for disqualification, as is using spells that detect the presence of illusions, such as detect magic or true seeing. Other magic, such as enchantment spells, are encouraged, and can be cast upon bystanders or other players to gain an edge in the game. Revealing that an Illusionist's Ball is taking place to a bystander is also grounds for disqualification.": "游戏的目标是找到并隐蔽地杀死所有其他玩家的假人（假人死后会消失），同时保持你的假人不被发现。杀害旁观者或玩家会被取消资格，使用检测幻象的法术也会被取消资格，如检测魔法或真视。其他魔法，如魔法咒语，是被鼓励的，可以对旁观者或其他玩家施放，以获得游戏中的优势。向旁观者透露正在举行的幻术舞会也是取消资格的理由。",
	"The immortal test of a spellcaster's might is the Spell Duel, a contest that directly pits the arcane power of two spellcasters against one another. Both spellcasters must have an arcane focus to participate in a spell duel. The duel happens in a continuous stream of arcane energy, but can be thought of by players as occurring in rounds.": "咒语决斗是对施法者力量的不朽考验，这是一场直接让两个施法者的奥术力量相互对抗的竞赛。两个施法者都必须有一个奥术焦点才能参加法术决斗。决斗是在连续的奥术能量流中进行的，但玩家可以认为是分回合进行的。",
	"At the beginning of each round, each spellcaster expends one spell slot up their choice in secret. Each spellcaster then makes an ability check using their spellcasting ability, adding the spell slot's level to the roll, and adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient with the Arcana skill. When a spellcaster loses this skill contest three times, their arcane focus breaks and they lose the duel.": "在每个回合开始时，每个施法者都要秘密地消耗一个他们选择的法术槽。然后每个施法者使用他们的法术能力进行能力检查，在卷轴上加上法术槽的等级，如果他们精通奥术技能，则加上他们的熟练度奖励。当一个施法者在这场技能竞赛中输掉三次时，他们的奥术焦点就会中断，并失去决斗。",
	"Alternatively, a spell duel can be a lethal contest, in which case the spellcasters eschew the use of arcane focuses and channel their arcane energy directly at one another. In this variation, when a spellcaster loses the skill contest, they take 1d6 force damage for every level of the slot expended by their opponent.": "另外，法术决斗也可以是一场致命的竞赛，在这种情况下，施法者放弃使用奥术焦点，直接向对方输送奥术能量。在这种变化中，当施法者在技能竞赛中失败时，他们会因对手消耗的每一级槽而受到1d6的力量伤害。",
	"Above all else, Summoner's Chess is a two-spellcaster game of strategy. This game takes place on a large 40-foot by 40-foot board, whose 5-foot by 5-foot tiles alternate between white and black -- essentially a massive chess board, though some summoners use hexagonal variants on the board. Each spellcaster can summon monsters to occupy the 15 nearest tiles on their side of the board (for non-standard boards, this number is always one less than one fourth the total number of tiles.) The most popular spells used for this task are conjure animals, conjure woodland beings, find familiar, and occasionally conjure minor elementals, though very powerful spellcasters might cast conjure celestial or conjure elemental once each. Each spellcaster can concentrate on more than one conjuration spell for the duration of the game (making only a single Constitution check for all their spells to maintain concentration), but these spells immediately end when the game is complete.": "最重要的是，召唤师之棋是一种双施法者的策略游戏。这个游戏发生在一个40英尺×40英尺的大棋盘上，其5英尺×5英尺的牌在白色和黑色之间交替出现--本质上是一个巨大的国际象棋棋盘，尽管有些召唤师在棋盘上使用六边形的变体。每个施法者都可以召唤怪物来占据棋盘上离自己最近的15张牌（对于非标准棋盘，这个数字总是比总牌数的四分之一少一个）。这个任务最常用的法术是召唤动物、召唤林地生物、寻找熟人，偶尔也会召唤小元素，不过非常强大的施法者可能会分别施展一次召唤天体或召唤元素。在游戏期间，每个施法者都可以专注于一个以上的魔法咒语（对他们所有的咒语只做一次宪法检查以保持专注），但这些咒语在游戏结束时立即结束。",
	"Once each spellcaster has populated their side of the board, they also take a place on the board. The objective of the game is to harry the opposing spellcaster to lose concentration on their spells. If a spellcaster loses concentration on their spells, they lose the game.": "一旦每个施法者在棋盘上填满了自己的一方，他们也会在棋盘上占一个位置。游戏的目的是骚扰对方的施法者，使其失去对法术的注意力。如果一个施法者失去了对其法术的注意力，他们就会输掉比赛。",
	"Spellcasters take turns commanding their summons to move around the board. On each turn, a spellcaster can only move one summoned creature and command it to take an action. Many spellcasters play with a variation allowing a player to command 2 summoned creatures of CR 1/2 or lower or 3 summoned creatures of CR 1/4 or lower on a single turn. Each creature can only occupy one space and can attack opposed creatures on adjacent spaces, regardless of its size. A spellcaster can't cast any spells once the game has begun.": "施法者轮流指挥他们的召唤物在棋盘上移动。在每个回合中，施法者只能移动一个召唤物，并命令它采取一个行动。许多施法者使用一种变体，允许玩家在一个回合内指挥2个CR 1/2或更低的召唤生物或3个CR 1/4或更低的召唤生物。每个生物只能占据一个空间，并且可以攻击相邻空间的敌对生物，无论其大小如何。一旦游戏开始，施法者就不能施放任何法术。",
	"Some spellcasters (especially warmages) play with fairly sophisticated rules for this game, such as implementing rules for Castling and en passant, but these are not standard.": "一些施法者（尤其是暖男）在这个游戏中使用了相当复杂的规则，比如执行城堡和通行的规则，但这些都不是标准规则。",
	"Mortals and gods alike have been playing games of luck since the dawn of times. Sometimes for leisure, other times for determining dramatic outcomes. In ancient times, Jergal bequeathed his kingdoms of undeath after a game of knuckbones. Zeus allocated divine domains to his sibilings by a random draw. Romulus and Remus settled tehir dispute by watching the skies for birds. When it comes to taking arbitrary decisions, a game of chance is the fairest of all.": "自古以来，凡人和众神都在玩运气游戏。有时是为了休闲，有时是为了决定戏剧性的结果。在古代，Jergal在一场指骨游戏后将他的不死王国遗赠给了别人。宙斯通过随机抽签将神圣的领域分配给他的兄弟姐妹。罗穆卢斯和莱姆斯通过观察天空中的鸟类来解决他们的争端。当涉及到任意决定时，机会的游戏是最公平的。",

	"The centrepiece of any tourney is the chaotic brawl known as the 'melee'. In this massive fight, where dozens or even hundreds of warriors fight it out with sword, axe and mace, combat is governed by strict rules of chivalry, and killing your foes is disallowed. Melee is divided into Free-for-All, in which the last contestant standing wins, and the Team contests, where warriors are split into two sides that engage each other in formation. Team melees, are further divided into mounted and dismounted battles - mounted fights are generally preferred by audiences, but may not be feasible if there is a shortage of knights or warhorses.": "任何巡回赛的核心是被称为 \"混战 \"的混乱争斗。在这场大规模的战斗中，几十个甚至几百个战士用剑、斧头和狼牙棒进行战斗，战斗受到严格的骑士精神规则的约束，不允许杀死你的敌人。混战分为 \"自由对决 \"和 \"团队竞赛\"，在前者中，最后站立的选手获胜，而在后者中，战士们被分成两方，以队形相互交战。团队近战又分为骑马和不骑马的战斗--观众一般喜欢骑马的战斗，但如果缺少骑士或战马，可能就不可行了。",
	"In a melee, fighters must wield melee weapons, though thrown weapons such as javelins may be permitted. It is most unchivalrous to use lethal force in a melee (though accidents can happen) and anyone seen striking an opponent who is on the ground will be disqualified and ejected from the arena. Magic is usually restricted to magic items only, though some melees may allow spells with a range of touch or self to be used.": "在近战中，选手必须使用近战武器，但也允许使用标枪等投掷武器。在近战中使用致命武力是非常不道德的（尽管意外可能发生），任何被看到打击倒在地上的对手的人都将被取消资格并被逐出赛场。魔法通常只限于魔法物品，但有些混战可能允许使用范围为触摸或自身的法术。",
	"Fighters may voluntarily retire from a melee at any stage by taking an action on their turn to lay down their weapons and declare themselves out of action. Anyone who attacks a retired fighter will be disqualified.": "斗士可以在任何阶段自愿退出混战，在他们的回合中采取行动，放下他们的武器并宣布自己退出行动。任何攻击退役战士的人都将被取消资格。",
	"You can perform this action on a prone opponent within 5 feet of you, as long as you are not within the reach of any standing opponents. When you take the Eliminate action, the target is immediately disqualified from the melee and must drop their weapons at the next opportunity and leave the fighting area by the shortest available route. Anyone who attacks an eliminated combatant will also be disqualified.": "只要你不在任何站立对手的范围内，你就可以对你5英尺内的俯卧对手执行这个动作。当你采取消除行动时，目标会立即被取消近战资格，并且必须在下一次机会中放下武器，以最短的可用路线离开战斗区域。任何攻击被淘汰的战斗人员的人也将被取消资格。",
	"Before the fight, determine the number of fighters (including the PCs) that will be participating. To calculate this quickly, you can roll 12d10 or 1d12*10 (minimum 40). Melee fighters will be a mixture of warriors; you may wish to use the knight, veteran, thug and berserker stat blocks to represent them.": "在战斗之前，确定将参加战斗的战士（包括NPC）的数量。为了快速计算，你可以滚动12d10或1d12*10（最少40）。近战战士将是战士的混合体；你可能希望使用骑士、老兵、暴徒和狂战士的状态块来代表他们。",
	"Though the melee is large and filled with combatants, the players will only attract the attention of a few enemies at a time while many more fight and are eliminated elsewhere in the brawl. Therefore, the player's battle takes place within a 25 ft. x 25 ft. square area of the arena - one of many such areas - wherein enemy combatants routinely surge. If a PC exits this area while there are other combatants in the arena, they provoke an opportunity attack from a random combatant for every 10 feet they travel.": "虽然近战的规模很大，而且充满了战斗人员，但玩家每次只会吸引几个敌人的注意，而更多的敌人则在争斗的其他地方战斗和被淘汰掉。因此，玩家的战斗发生在竞技场的一个25英尺×25英尺的方形区域内--许多这样的区域之一--敌人的战斗人员经常会涌入这里。如果一个人在竞技场内有其他战斗人员时离开这个区域，他们每走10英尺就会引起一个随机战斗人员的机会攻击。",
	"At the beginning of the melee, and at the beginning of each turn of combat, roll 1d8. That many enemies enter the player's section of the arena on that turn (provided there is space for them to enter at the periphery of the arena). This is called a Melee Round. The battle has a number of Melee Rounds based upon the number of fighters in the brawl. To determine the number of Melee Rounds, divide the total number of fighters by 2 (rounding down, if necessary), and continue dividing by 2 until the result is 1 or lower. The number of times you divided to reach this result is the number of Melee Rounds.": "在近战开始时，以及在每一回合的战斗开始时，滚动1d8。在该回合中，有这么多的敌人进入玩家的竞技场区域（只要在竞技场的外围有空间让他们进入）。这被称为近战回合。战斗的近战回合数是根据争斗中的战士数量而定的。要确定近战回合数，需要用战士总数除以2（必要时向下取整），然后继续除以2，直到结果为1或更低。你除以这个结果的次数就是近战回合的数量。",
	"After the Melee Rounds are complete, the PCs still have to contend with the remaining combatants in the arena, possibly including each other, before the melee is complete.": "在近战回合结束后，在近战结束前，NPC仍然要与竞技场上剩余的战斗人员（可能包括彼此）进行较量。",
	"In a Free-for-All melee, all enemy combatants that enter combat on a melee round are hostile to the party, whereas in Team melee, only half are hostile, whereas the other half are friendly, and will fight alongside that party. Free-for-All melee continues until only one combatant is left standing, whereas Team melee continues until only one team remains.": "在自由混战中，所有在混战回合中进入战斗的敌方战斗人员都对本方有敌意，而在团队混战中，只有一半是敌方，而另一半是友方，并将与本方一起战斗。自由混战一直持续到只剩下一个战斗人员，而团队混战则一直持续到只剩下一个团队。",
	"One of the most spectacular sights at a tourney is the thunderous crash of lance against shield that signifies a pair of knights tilting at each other in a joust. At a tourney, jousts are usually held as part of a knockout competition where winning knights advance through a series of rounds until just two finalists are left to compete for the prize.": "巡回赛中最壮观的景象之一是长枪对盾牌的雷鸣般的撞击声，这意味着一对骑士在比武中相互倾轧。在巡回赛中，比武通常作为淘汰赛的一部分举行，获胜的骑士通过一系列的比赛晋级，直到只剩下两个决赛选手来争夺奖金。",
	"Jousts are conducted as a set number of charges (usually 3), ending early if a rider is unhorsed and thus automatically defeated. If neither rider is unhorsed after 3 rounds, the winner is decided by points, with 1 point scored for each accurate hit on the opponent's shield and 2 points for each lance broken against the opponent. If the result is still a tie, the audience will vote on a winner. Local heroes, charismatic fan favourites and well-groomed horses have a clear edge if it comes down to a vote.": "比武以设定的冲锋次数进行（通常为3次），如果有骑手未骑马，则提前结束，从而自动落败。如果3轮过后，两个骑手都没有骑马，则以积分决定胜负，每准确击中对手的盾牌得1分，每折断对手的长矛得2分。如果结果仍是平局，观众将投票决定胜负。如果要投票的话，当地的英雄、有魅力的粉丝喜欢的人和精心打扮的马匹都有明显的优势。",
	"For each charge, initiative is determined by a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Attacks are then made as normal against the target's AC, and any damage that would be dealt on a hit is instead dealt to the lance. Tourney lances have 10 HP and are replaced after each charge even if not broken. It should be noted that if the knight going second is unhorsed, they cannot attack, and they have disadvantage on their attack if they were struck but not unhorsed. If the initiative roll is tied, both characters attack at the same time and either or both could potentially be unhorsed. Characters with the Extra Attack feature cannot use it in a joust, but characters with the Mounted Combatant feat have advantage on the attack roll.": "对于每次冲锋，主动权由智慧（动物处理）检查决定。然后按照正常的方式对目标的AC进行攻击，任何被击中的伤害都会对长矛造成伤害。巡回赛长矛有10个HP，每次冲锋后都会被替换，即使没有被打破。需要注意的是，如果第二个上场的骑士没有被击中，他们就不能攻击，如果他们被击中但没有被击中，他们的攻击就有劣势。如果主动权卷轴打成平手，则两个角色同时攻击，其中一个或两个都有可能被解马。具有额外攻击功能的角色不能在比武中使用，但具有骑马战斗者特技的角色在攻击卷上有优势。",
	"If a knight is hit, they must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to the damage rolled. On a failure, they are unhorsed. When a rider is unhorsed, they make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone and are stunned for one round after falling. If the save is failed by 5 or more, the rider also suffers a {@table random lingering injury|lingering injury|DMG} as per the table on page 272 of the DMG.": "如果骑士被击中，他们必须做一个力量救赎，其DC等于所受伤害。如果失败，他们就会被卸下马匹。当骑士被解开时，他们必须做一个DC15的灵巧蓄力动作。如果失败，他们就会倒下，并且在倒下后被击晕一回合。如果救赎失败5次或更多，骑手也会受到{@table random lingering injury|lingering injury|DMG}的伤害，如DMG第272页的表格所示。",
	"A particularly noble and genteel crowd might object to the violence and danger inherent in regular jousting, preferring instead that the knights demonstrate their grace and finesse by spearing a series of hanging rings.": "一个特别高贵和有风度的人群可能会反对常规比武中固有的暴力和危险，而更喜欢骑士们通过刺穿一系列吊环来展示他们的优雅和狡猾。",
	"In ring jousting, knights take turns to complete a course that features a number of set of rings. They have to choose whether to aim at the larger, smaller or medium sized ring from each set. The largest ring has and AC of 12 and is worth 1 point, the medium ring has an AC of 15 and is worth 2 points and the smallest ring has an AC of 18 and is worth 3 points. The knight with the most points at the end of the course wins. Knights must use their Dexterity instead of Strength to attack when jousting at rings.": "在擂台比武中，骑士们轮流完成一个具有若干套擂台的课程。他们必须选择是否瞄准每组中较大、较小或中等大小的环。最大的环的AC为12，价值1分，中等环的AC为15，价值2分，最小的环的AC为18，价值3分。课程结束时，积分最多的骑士获胜。骑士在擂台比武时必须使用他们的灵巧而不是力量来进行攻击。",
	"On the other hand, some crowds want to see blood. Jousting can be made much grittier and more dangerous by having the knights continue to fight on foot after one has been unhorsed.": "另一方面，有些观众希望看到流血。比武可以通过让骑士们在一个人被卸下马后继续步行战斗而变得更加狡猾和危险。",
	"In these extended bouts, a mounted knight must dismount immediately when their opponent is unhorsed - it should be assumed that the horse moves 60 feet before the rider's next turn, though they can attempt to dismount halfway through this move as a reaction to seeing their opponent fall with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (on a failure, they fall prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage). They must then draw a melee weapon (usually a longsword or a mace) and continue the fight on foot until one of the knights yields or is knocked unconscious.": "在这些长时间的战斗中，当他们的对手被卸下马时，骑马的骑士必须立即下马--应该假定马在骑手的下一个回合之前移动了60英尺，尽管他们可以尝试在这个移动的中途下马，作为看到他们的对手倒下的反应，成功地进行DC 15灵巧（杂技）检查（如果失败，他们会倒地并受到2d6重击的伤害）。然后他们必须拔出近战武器（通常是长剑或狼牙棒），继续步行战斗，直到其中一个骑士屈服或被击倒。",
	"The melee and the jousting are the main events at a tourney. However, both of these events are relatively short-lived, and insufficient to occupy hundreds or even thousands of visitors for the duration of the show. Thus, an assortment of sideactivities are laid on, such as the following...": "混战和比武是巡回赛的主要项目。然而，这两项活动都是相对短暂的，不足以让数百甚至数千名游客在整个表演期间都能得到满足。因此，会有各种各样的辅助活动，例如以下活动......",
	"While competition in melee and jousting events is restricted to knights and nobles only, archery contests are usually open to all, including commoners and children. This makes them one of the very few means by which a commoner can come to the attention of powerful people - and even a modest cash prize is sure to generate lots of interest.": "虽然近战和比武的比赛只限于骑士和贵族，但射箭比赛通常对所有人开放，包括平民和儿童。这使得它们成为平民可以引起有权势的人注意的极少数手段之一--即使是适度的现金奖励也肯定会引起很多人的兴趣。",
	"Archery contests are usually organised as three-round elimination tournaments where archers are split into lines and the highest-scoring archer (sometimes the top two) from each line advances to one of two semi-finals. Then the winners of each semi-final face off one-on-one for the grand prize. In each round, the archers fire 6 arrows at a target 60ft away (though the range can vary - junior contests are usually shorter and grand finals often longer). Archers must use either shortbows or longbows; crossbows and other weapons are not allowed in archery contests.": "射箭比赛通常以三轮淘汰赛的形式进行，弓箭手被分成几行，每行得分最高的弓箭手（有时是前两名）进入两场半决赛中的一场。然后每场半决赛的获胜者一对一地对决，争夺大奖。在每一轮比赛中，弓箭手向60英尺外的目标发射6支箭（尽管射程可能有所不同 - 初级比赛通常较短，总决赛通常较长）。弓箭手必须使用短弓或长弓；弩和其他武器不允许用于射箭比赛。",
	"Points are scored according to the accuracy of the shot, determined by the archer's attack roll: 1 for white (AC 10), 2 for black (AC 12), 3 for blue (AC 14), 4 for red (AC 16), 5 for yellow (AC 18). When contests are held outdoors, there is a risk of sudden gusts of wind. The DM may therefore roll a d20 each round; all archers have disadvantage on their next shot if the result is a 20.": "分数是根据射击的准确性来决定的，由弓箭手的攻击卷决定。1为白色（AC 10），2为黑色（AC 12），3为蓝色（AC 14），4为红色（AC 16），5为黄色（AC 18）。当比赛在户外举行时，有可能会出现突然的大风。因此，DM可以在每一轮掷出一个D20；如果结果是20，所有的弓箭手在下一次射击时都有劣势。",
	"Some tourneys have a prize for the best-dressed lord or lady. This can get just as competitive as the jousting, and the rewards can be just as big - aside from the winner's pot of cash, this is also an excellent way to attract high-class suitors.": "一些巡回赛为穿得最漂亮的领主或夫人设置了奖项。这可能会像比武一样竞争激烈，奖励也同样丰厚--除了赢家的现金罐，这也是吸引高级求婚者的绝佳方式。",
	"Commoners, that is, anyone without a Scroll of Pedigree, will not be considered for this contest but, once one is in contention, anything goes. The winner should be determined by combining three numbers into a total score: a) the cost of their outfit in gp, up to a maximum of 50, b) a Charisma (Performance) check, to demonstrate how well they carried off their look and c) an Intelligence (History) check, to represent how well the contestant is following the current trends and fashions.": "平民，也就是没有血统卷轴的人，将不被考虑参加这次比赛，但是，一旦参加比赛，什么都可以。赢家应该由三个数字组合成一个总分来决定：a）他们的服装成本，以金币为单位，最高为50；b）魅力（表现）检查，以证明他们的造型有多好；c）智力（历史）检查，以代表参赛者对当前趋势和时尚的关注程度。",
	"No tourney would be complete without a lively betting market! Jousting, in particular, with its clear winners, quick results and frequent upsets is perfect for gambling. If a player wants to bet on a joust between two knights that are not equally matched, odds should be calculated as follows:": "如果没有活跃的博彩市场，任何巡回赛都是不完整的！尤其是比武，它有明确的赢家，快速的结果和频繁的颠覆。特别是比武，由于其明显的赢家，快速的结果和频繁的颠覆，非常适合于赌博。如果玩家想在两个不相上下的骑士之间的比武上下注，赔率应按以下方式计算。",
	"1. Compare the knights' strength modifier. For each point of difference, give the stronger knight 1 'edge point'.": "1. 比较骑士的力量修正值。每有一点差异，就给较强的骑士1个 \"边缘点\"。",
	"2. If one knight has the Mounted Combatant feat and the other doesn't, give the feat-holder 1 edge point.": "2. 如果一个骑士有骑兵特技，而另一个没有，给特技持有者1个优势点。",
	"3. If one knight has proficiency in Strength saves and the other doesn't, give the proficient knight 1 edge point.": "3. 如果一个骑士精通力量救赎而另一个没有，给精通的骑士1个优势点。",
	"4. Compare the edge point totals and note the difference. The one with more points is the favourite.": "4. 比较边缘的积分总数，并注意其差异。得分多的是最受欢迎的。",
	"5. The underdog's odds should be X:2, where X is equal to 2 plus 1 for the first edge point of difference plus 2 for each subsequent edge point.": "5. 劣势方的赔率应该是X:2，其中X等于2加1的第一个边缘点的差异，再加2的每个后续边缘点。",
	"6. The favourite's odds are the inverse of the underdog's.": "6. 喜爱者的赔率是劣势者的反比。",
	"Worked example: Knight A has a Strength score of 20, proficiency in Strength saves and the Mounted Combatant feat. Knight B has 16 Strength and neither of those things. Knight A therefore has 4 edge points over Knight B. Knight B's odds are therefore set at 9:2 and Knight A's odds are 2:9. If a player bet 9 gold and Knight A, who then went on to win, the player would receive 11 gold back from the bookmaker.": "实例。骑士A的力量值为20，熟练掌握力量救赎和骑兵特技。骑士B的力量值为16，这些都不是。因此，骑士A比骑士B有4个优势点，骑士B的赔率因此定为9：2，骑士A的赔率为2：9。如果玩家下注9个金币和骑士A，然后骑士A赢了，玩家将从庄家那里得到11个金币的回报。",
	"Note that this calculation does not produce precise odds, nor does it take into account smaller factors like differences in the knights' proficiency bonuses or Animal Handling scores. Calculating precise odds is mathematically complex and, more importantly, beyond the capabilities of the average NPC bookmaker.": "请注意，这种计算并不能产生精确的赔率，也没有考虑到较小的因素，如骑士的熟练度奖励或动物处理分数的差异。计算精确的赔率在数学上很复杂，更重要的是，超出了一般NPC赌徒的能力。",
	"When tourneys are held far away from the big cities, it is possible that large sections of the audience have never seen a wizard or bard in their lives. Therefore, it is not unusual for spellcasters to travel out to big tourneys in order to supplement their incomes. A PC with the ability to play an instrument or cast illusion spells can spend their time at the tourney entertaining crowds - and come home with a fistful of silver for their troubles. Performers can expect to earn an amount of gp equal to 1d8 + their Charisma modifier per hour, but spellcasters must expend one spell slot (of any level) for each hour of performance.": "当巡回赛在远离大城市的地方举行时，很大一部分观众有可能一辈子都没有见过巫师或吟游诗人。因此，施法者为了补充他们的收入而外出参加大型巡回赛的情况并不罕见。一个有能力演奏乐器或施展幻觉法术的人可以在巡回赛上花时间招待观众--然后带着一撮银子回家。表演者每小时可以赚取相当于1d8+他们的魅力修正值的金币，但施法者每小时的表演必须消耗一个法术槽（任何级别）。",

However, the sport sorely needed an update for 5th edition, so I've taken it upon myself to simplify the sport a little and convert it over.": "现在是我们谈论围攻球的时候了。每个战役世界的人都需要某种形式的娱乐消遣，当然除了杀怪和做任务之外。攻城球，一个我从/tg/偷来的概念（在这里阅读），是我在3.5版本的战役中的首选。它很有趣，很暴力，与各种角色相得益彰，并巧妙地利用了现有的游戏机制。然而，这项运动非常需要在第五版中进行更新，所以我决定将这项运动简化一下，并将其转换过来。",
	"Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls.": "攻城球是两队之间的游戏，每队五人。每队都有一座塔，以防御对方的攻击。然而，玩家不能直接攻击塔楼。相反，有一个球可以用来击倒塔楼。当一队的塔倒下时，他们就输了。",
	"The game is played in a walled rectangular arena. Normally, this arena is 140 feet long by 45 feet wide (28 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all sizes and shapes exist. Each team's tower, a 5-foot dimeter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set up 10 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise. Towers have 25 hit points and can only be damaged by the impact of the ball.": "比赛是在一个有墙的长方形竞技场进行的。通常情况下，这个竞技场长140英尺，宽45英尺（28个方块乘9个方块），尽管存在各种大小和形状的竞技场。每队的塔，是一个由木头或松散的石头制成的5英尺直径的柱子，从竞技场的两端纵向设置10英尺。塔有25个打击点，只能被球的冲击力损坏。",
	"Central to the game of siegeball is the ball, an especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking it. Though in some places, players strike the ball with their hands or fists, usually players are given bats (which use the statistics of a club), or even more powerful melee weapons, like warhammers and mauls.": "攻城球游戏的核心是球，这是一个特别密集的实心橡胶或包裹皮革的球体，由球员追赶。这个球重得惊人，球员通过攻击它来移动它。虽然在一些地方，球员用手或拳头击球，但通常球员都会得到球棒（使用俱乐部的统计数据），或更强大的近战武器，如战锤和槌子。",
	"The ball has an AC of 8 and a pool of Momentum Points, which determine how fast it's moving.": "该球的AC值为8，并有一个动量点，这决定了它的移动速度。",
	"{@b Attacking the Ball}. When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. On a hit, the ball gains a number of momentum points equal to half the damage dealt to it, rounded down. The ball moves five feet in the chosen direction for each momentum point it has. As it moves, the ball subtracts one momentum point for each five feet it moves until it stops.": "{@b Attacking the Ball}. 当你攻击球时，你可以选择在八个基本方向中的一个方向攻击它。击中后，球获得的动量点数等于它所受伤害的一半，向下取整。球在所选择的方向上移动五英尺，每一个动量点。在移动过程中，球每移动五英尺就会减去一个动量点，直到它停止。",
	"The ball can collide with wall, objects, or towers.": "球可以与墙壁、物体或塔楼相撞。",
	"{@b Colliding with a Wall}. If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops. Colliding with a Player. You can use your reaction to hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the ball's current momentum points, and send it in a new direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take damage equal to twice the ball's current momentum points and are knocked prone.": "{@b Colliding with a Wall}. 如果球与墙相撞，它会以与其方向相对应的角度弹开，并继续移动，直到停止。与球员相撞。如果球与你相撞，你可以用你的反应来打球。要做到这一点，请做一个针对球的攻击卷。在移动时，球有一个等于其当前动量点的AC的加成。一旦命中，就会像平常一样掷出伤害值，移除球的当前动量点，并将其送往一个新的方向。如果你没有击中，球会击中你，你会受到相当于球当前动量点两倍的伤害并被击倒。",
	"If you do not use your reaction to stop the ball, it rolls past you.": "如果你不利用你的反应来阻止球，它就会从你身边滚过。",
	"{@b Colliding with a Tower}. If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the twice the ball's current momentum points and then stops.": "{@b Colliding with a Tower}. 如果球与塔相撞，它对塔造成的伤害等于球当前动量点的两倍，然后停止。",
	"Playing the Game The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball. The player with the higher attack roll successfully attacks the ball. Players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball, but need not begin on their own side.": "比赛开始时，在场馆中心开球。每队的一名球员对球进行攻击卷。攻击卷数较高的球员成功攻击球。球员从距离球10英尺和30英尺范围内开始，但不需要从自己这边开始。",
	"Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the DM can choose for the teams to take turns acting, instead of keeping track of the players individually. The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hp.": "玩家按主动权顺序行动。如果愿意的话，管理员可以选择让各队轮流行动，而不是单独跟踪玩家。当一个塔被减少到0马力时，游戏结束。",
	"Siegeball is a widely-played sport and the exact rules and standards change wherever the game is played. The only concrete rule of Siegeball is not to attack your opponent's tower directly. In most arenas, using magic and attacking players directly are also considered cheating (though this doesn't stop some witches and wizards from influencing the games anyway). However, other behaviors, like shoving opposing players or kicking dirt into their eyes, is tolerated and sometimes even encouraged.": "攻城球是一项广泛开展的运动，无论在哪里进行比赛，确切的规则和标准都会改变。围攻球的唯一具体规则是不要直接攻击对手的塔。在大多数竞技场，使用魔法和直接攻击玩家也被认为是作弊（尽管这并不能阻止一些巫师和魔法师影响游戏）。然而，其他行为，如推搡对方球员或将泥土踢入他们的眼睛，是可以容忍的，有时甚至是鼓励的。",
	"In seedier games, Siegeball is a violent, high-stakes competition. with spellcasters on both sides attempting to secretly fix the game for their side, while the players try to disguise outright attacks on their opponents as legitimate maneuvers. Bets on Siegeball range from a few silver pieces to bags of gold, and games are particularly cut-throat when fortunes are on the line.": "在更多的游戏中，攻城球是一种暴力、高风险的竞争。双方的施法者都试图为自己一方暗中修复游戏，而玩家则试图将对对手的直接攻击伪装成合法的机动性。赌注从几块银币到几袋金子不等，当财富处于危险境地时，游戏就显得尤为残酷。",
	"In addition to attacking, dodging, shoving, and dashing, (and occasionally using an item forbidden by the referees), there are a few special actions that players of a siegeball game might take.": "除了攻击、躲避、推搡和冲撞，（偶尔也会使用裁判员禁止的物品），攻城球游戏的玩家还可能采取一些特殊行动。",
	"{@b Attack a Player (Illegally)}. In the most disreputable games, direct assaults on other players is not only allowed, it's encouraged. In most games, however, an attack can only be made when the referee isn't looking. When you make an attack on a creature in an arena that doesn't allow direct attacks, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. On a success, you attack the player without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.": "{@b Attack a Player (Illegally)}. 在最令人不齿的游戏中，直接攻击其他玩家不仅是允许的，而且是鼓励的。然而，在大多数游戏中，只有在裁判员不注意的时候才能进行攻击。当你在一个不允许直接攻击的竞技场中对一个生物进行攻击时，请进行灵巧（隐身）检查或魅力（欺骗）检查，由裁判员的被动感知得分来争夺。如果成功，你就会攻击该玩家而不会有任何后果。如果失败，你将在下一回合退出游戏，并在竞技场靠近你的塔的一侧重新进入游戏。",
	"Shove actions do not incur a penalty.": "推搡行为不会产生惩罚。",
	"{@b Block}. You dig in your heels and hold your ground. You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being moved against your will, and you can use your reaction to attack any ball that moves within 5 feet of you. Additionally, if the ball is within 5 feet of you, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against it.": "{@b Block}. 你紧紧抓住你的脚跟，坚守阵地。你在任何能力检查或蓄力投掷上都有优势，以抵制违背你意愿的移动，并且你可以使用你的反应来攻击任何在你5英尺范围内移动的球。此外，如果球在你的5英尺范围内，其他生物在对它进行攻击时有劣势。",
	"{@b Cast a Spell (Illegally)}. In very high society (especially elven society) certain types of more civilized magic might be allowed in siegeball games, but the vast majority of games, any arcana is paramount to cheating. When you cast a spell in an arena that doesn't allow magic, you can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. This roll has advantage if the target is within 5 feet of you, the effect of the spell doesn't include any large audio or visual cues (like certain illusion spells, or spells like gust of wind), or the spell is cast with the sorcerer's Subtle Spell Metamagic. It has disadvantage if the target of the spell is more than 5 feet away from you, or if the effect of the spell has obvious audio or visual effects. On a success, you cast the spell without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.": "{@b Cast a Spell (Illegally)}. 在非常高的社会中（尤其是精灵社会），某些类型的更文明的魔法可能在攻城球游戏中被允许，但绝大多数的游戏，任何奥术都是最重要的作弊手段。当你在一个不允许使用魔法的竞技场中施法时，你可以做一个灵巧（隐身）检查或魅力（欺骗）检查，由裁判员的被动感知得分来竞争。如果目标在你的5英尺范围内，法术的效果不包括任何大型的声音或视觉提示（比如某些幻觉法术，或者像阵风这样的法术），或者该法术是用巫师的微妙法术Metamagic施放的，那么该卷就有优势。如果法术的目标离你超过5英尺，或者法术的效果有明显的音频或视觉效果，那么它就有劣势。成功时，你施展该法术而不产生任何后果。失败时，你将在下一回合退出游戏，并在竞技场靠近你的塔的一侧重新进入游戏。",
	"Inborn magical abilities like a dragonborn's Breath Weapon may or may not count as magic, at the referee's discretion.": "天生的魔法能力，如龙裔的呼吸武器，可以算作魔法，也可以不算，由裁判员决定。",
	"{@b Follow}. When you take this action, choose a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. When that creature moves, you attempt to follow behind it, moving up to your base speed, while remaining the same distance between yourself and the lead creature for the entire duration of the movement.": "{@b Follow}. 当你采取这个行动时，选择一个你能看到的在你10英尺范围内的生物。当那个生物移动时，你试图跟在它后面，以你的基本速度移动，同时在整个移动过程中，你和领先的生物之间保持相同的距离。",
	"{@b Retire}. When you take this action, you remove yourself from the field and sit out the rest of the game. This may be useful to free yourself from danger, but you can no longer help your team.": "{@b Retire}. 当你采取这一行动时，你会把自己从场上移开，并在剩下的比赛中缺席。这对使自己摆脱危险可能是有用的，但你不能再帮助你的球队。",
	"{@b Tackle}. Performing a tackle is a special variant of shoving a creature. You have advantage on a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). On a success, you and the target are knocked prone in the target's space.": "{@b Tackle}. 执行擒拿是推搡生物的一个特殊变体。你在由目标的力量（竞技）或灵巧（杂技）检定（由目标选择使用的能力）所争夺的力量（竞技）检定中具有优势。如果成功，你和目标都会被击倒在目标的空间里。",
	"Different siegeball arenas impose different restrictions on the games they hold, ranging from so-called underground arenas, where blood is more important than sport, to the mainstream arenas, which are funded by kings or other nobility, and thus impose fairly civilized rules.": "不同的攻城球赛场对他们举行的比赛有不同的限制，从所谓的地下赛场，血液比运动更重要，到主流赛场，由国王或其他贵族资助，因此实行相当文明的规则。",
	"The following are some of restrictions that an arena might impose on the game:": "以下是一个竞技场可能对游戏施加的一些限制。",
	"{@b Everything Goes}. Magic, deadly weapons, direct attacks on players, and even murder is all allowed in this game. Arenas that play with these rules are typically deemed Blood Arenas by spectators, and their players (which are paid handsomely for surviving) are more like gladiators than professional athletes. Expect these arenas in drow cities, and other evil locales.": "{@b Everything Goes}. 在这个游戏中，魔法、致命武器、直接攻击玩家，甚至谋杀都是允许的。遵循这些规则的竞技场通常被观众认为是血腥竞技场，他们的选手（为生存而获得丰厚的报酬）更像是角斗士而不是职业运动员。预计这些竞技场将出现在鸦人城市和其他邪恶的地方。",
	"{@b Everything Goes (Limited)}. Magic and direct attacks on other players are allowed, but only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed, and outright murder disqualifies a team. These rules are typically held in run-down arenas in less prosperous cities (where new siegeball teams might just get their start.)": "{@b Everything Goes (Limited)}. 允许使用魔法和直接攻击其他玩家，但只允许使用常规的攻城球武器，而直接谋杀会取消球队的资格。这些规则通常在不太繁荣的城市的破旧竞技场举行（新的攻城球队可能只是在那里起步。）",
	"{@b All Weapons}. Weapons of any variety can be used in this game, up to and including massive warhammers and greatswords, but no magic of any sort is allowed. Towers have twice the HP in this game. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.": "{@b All Weapons}. 本游戏中可以使用任何种类的武器，包括大型战锤和大剑，但不允许使用任何种类的魔法。在这个游戏中，塔楼的HP是两倍。对其他玩家的攻击和非法的魔法都会受到惩罚，将违规的玩家赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个队伍被取消资格。",
	"This variant of the rules is similar to the conventional rules, but allows for spectacular and dangerous weapons (and, of course, more deadly \"accidents\"). Particularly ravenous crowds flock to these games for the fleeting chance of watching blood being spilled.": "这种规则的变体与传统规则相似，但允许使用壮观和危险的武器（当然还有更致命的 \"事故\"）。特别是贪婪的人群涌向这些游戏，因为有转瞬即逝的机会可以看到血流成河。",
	"{@b Limited Magic}. Some spells, specifically those which do not directly deal damage to members of the other team, are allowed and allowed. At least one player on each team is encouraged to know the spells dispel magic and counterspell. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team. Teleporting another player mid-game across the continent, however, is allowed.": "{@b Limited Magic}. 一些法术，特别是那些不直接对另一队成员造成伤害的法术，是允许的，也是被允许的。我们鼓励每队至少有一名队员知道驱散魔法和反魔法的法术。对其他队员的攻击和非法的魔法会受到惩罚，将违规的队员赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个队伍将被取消资格。然而，在比赛中把另一名球员传送到大陆另一边是允许的。",
	"These rules are more common where magic is viewed more favorably as a civilized art, rather than as the trickery of elves and witches. Though the spectators might seem more refined at first glance, they are just as ravenous for the blood and conflict of a good siegeball game.": "这些规则在魔法被视为文明艺术而非精灵和巫师的诡计时更为常见。虽然观众乍看之下可能更高雅，但他们也同样渴望一场精彩的攻城球比赛的血腥和冲突。",
	"{@b Conventional}. Only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed in this game, and all magic is disallowed. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.": "{@b Conventional}. 在这个游戏中只允许使用传统的攻城球武器，所有的魔法都是不允许的。对其他球员的攻击和非法的魔法将受到惩罚，即把违规的球员赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个球队将被取消资格。",
	"This is the dominant system of rules for the game, practiced in the most prominent siegeball arenas.": "这是游戏规则的主导系统，在最著名的围攻赛场上实行。",
	"Though individual, one-off siegeball games are held regularly, there's nothing so spectacular as a tournament: the thrill of rising to the top, the sting of defeat, and the lure of a grand prize and lasting glory. Few other things bring out spectators and players alike in droves. The grandeur of such tournaments is integral to siegeball on a grand scale, as they bring far-flung teams together, expand the sport's scope to a national scale, and unite players and spectators in a single, [grand] competition.": "虽然个人的、一次性的攻城球比赛经常举行，但没有什么比锦标赛更壮观的了：登顶的快感，失败的刺痛，以及大奖和持久荣誉的诱惑。很少有其他事情能让观众和球员成群结队地参加。这类锦标赛的宏大规模是围攻棒球不可或缺的，因为它们将遥远的队伍聚集在一起，将这项运动的范围扩大到全国范围，并将球员和观众团结在一个单一的[盛大]比赛中。",
	"Though tournaments are the lifeblood of career siegeball teams, there exists no one perfect way of conducting them. Each method of arranging a tournament has radical pros and cons, though most attempt to strike a balance between audience tension and accurate assessment of skill. The following tournament designs are often used for siegeball:": "虽然比赛是职业围攻队的生命线，但没有一种完美的方式来进行比赛。每种安排比赛的方法都有激进的优点和缺点，尽管大多数人都试图在观众的紧张感和对技能的准确评估之间取得平衡。以下是经常用于围棋的锦标赛设计。",
	" By far the simplest and shortest tournament is the singleelimination bracket. In this tournament, teams are randomly paired off on a pyramid, and losers are eliminated from the tournament. Winners advance to the next round until only one team remains.": " 到目前为止，最简单和最短的比赛是单淘汰赛。在这种比赛中，各队在金字塔上随机配对，失败者被淘汰出局。胜者进入下一轮，直到只剩下一支队伍。",
	"Though this tournament's design is attractive due to its simplicity, it suffers from some limitations. When spectators follow only a single team, they are unlikely to return after their team is eliminated; a result that is extremely likely when half of the competing teams are eliminated every round. Also, skilled teams can be eliminated early after only a single bad match, leading to upsets where the players blame the loss of an entire tournament on a single bad play or referee call.": "尽管这项比赛的设计因其简单而具有吸引力，但它也有一些局限性。当观众只关注一支球队时，他们不太可能在自己的球队被淘汰后再回来；当每轮都有一半的竞争球队被淘汰时，这种结果是极其可能的。另外，有技术的球队可能只在一场糟糕的比赛后就被提前淘汰，从而导致颠覆，即球员将整个比赛的损失归咎于一次糟糕的比赛或裁判的判罚。",
	"Despite its drawbacks, single elimination tournaments remain the favorite among orcish and goblinoid teams, perhaps because it doesn't hinder a tournament's progression if a half of a losing team is killed over the course of a game.": "尽管有缺点，单淘汰赛仍然是兽人和地精队伍的最爱，也许是因为在比赛过程中，如果输掉的队伍中有一半人被杀，也不会妨碍比赛的进程。",
	"A popular alternative to the single elimination tournament is the double elimination. This bracket proceeds like the single elimination bracket, except that losers are added to a loser's bracket, where they compete against each other. The final team remaining in the loser's bracket goes on to play the victor of the winner's bracket in the finals. This design ensures that teams play at least two games each, and that a single poor game doesn't condemn an otherwise superlative team.": "单淘汰赛的一个流行替代方案是双淘汰赛。这种比赛的过程与单淘汰赛类似，只是输家被加入到败者组，在那里他们互相竞争。最后留在败者组的球队在决赛中与胜者组的胜利者比赛。这种设计确保了各队至少各打两场比赛，而且一场糟糕的比赛也不会使一个原本优秀的球队受到谴责。",
	"A natural extension to the double elimination design, multilevel tournaments begin with all contending teams at the same \"level\", with a tournament score equal to the number of contending teams. A team gains one point on a victory, and loses one point on a defeat, and plays only other teams with the same tournament score as themselves, continuing until no two teams are on the same level (or until only one team is the victor, depending on the specific rules.) This design ensures that competitors play a roughly equal number of games, and that a maximum number of competitions happen at one time. Additionally, it's likely that teams will be more evenly matched for skill after a few rounds.": "作为双败淘汰赛设计的自然延伸，多级比赛开始时，所有参赛队都处于同一 \"级别\"，比赛得分与参赛队的数量相等。一支球队在胜利时获得一分，在失败时失去一分，并且只和其他与自己有相同比赛分数的球队比赛，一直到没有两支球队处于同一水平（或只有一支球队是胜利者，取决于具体规则）。此外，在几轮比赛之后，各队的技术可能会更加均衡。",
	"In a round-robin game, each competing team plays each other in sequence; the team with the greatest number of victories wins, or goes to a tie-breaker game. This is easily the fairest way of determining a victor, since every possible matchup in a tournament is played out, but it has yet to catch on in the national siegeball stage. Part of the reason might be that players are accustomed to the thrill of elimination, and the natural progression of more skilled teams matching against one another as the brackets become smaller. Whatever the reason, few leagues (except for elven leagues) employ this type of tournament.": "在循环赛中，各参赛队依次进行比赛；胜利次数多的队伍获胜，或进入决胜局。这是确定胜利者的最公平的方法，因为锦标赛中每一个可能的对决都会进行，但它还没有在国家围棋舞台上流行起来。部分原因可能是球员们已经习惯了淘汰赛的刺激，以及随着赛程的缩小，技术更高的球队自然会相互竞争。不管是什么原因，很少有联赛（除了精灵族联赛）采用这种类型的比赛。",
	"The annual Siegeball Championship League, held for the better part of a millennium, enjoys the largest scale and most prestigious prizes of any siegeball tournament. Taking part over a season, its athletes travel from city to city, competing in matches to separate the wheat from the chaff.": "一年一度的围棋冠军联赛，已经举办了一千年之久，是所有围棋比赛中规模最大、奖金最高的比赛。在一个赛季中，运动员们从一个城市到另一个城市，在比赛中分出高下。",
	"At its conclusion, only one team may win the Siegebowl, and claim its grand prize (normally an impressive quantity of gold). Perhaps more importantly, Championship victors claim legendary sports status for all time, and are enshrined in the Hall of Victors, an immortal dedication to champions throughout the ages.": "在比赛结束时，只有一支球队可以赢得围棋比赛，并获得其大奖（通常是数量惊人的黄金）。也许更重要的是，锦标赛的胜利者将获得永远的传奇体育地位，并被载入胜利者大厅，这是对历代冠军的不朽献礼。",
	"The Championship is a double-elimination competition, and every competing team must play one home game and one away game. Contending teams are selected by the Championship Committee, the presiding board of regulators and referees, and also must pay a hefty entry fee to compete. Though entry fees might pose an obstacle for upstart teams, they rarely present an obstacle to national contenders, which compete yearly.": "锦标赛是一项双淘汰赛，每支参赛队必须进行一场主场比赛和一场客场比赛。参赛队伍由锦标赛委员会、监管机构和裁判的主持委员会挑选，同时必须支付高昂的参赛费。虽然报名费可能会对新晋球队构成障碍，但对于每年都参加比赛的全国性竞争者来说，它们很少构成障碍。",
	"Few games are played exclusively for bragging rights and notoriety; tournaments run on their prizes. Large, enticing awards for winning teams fuels an entire industry of talent scouts, coaches, and arena owners, from the smallest games to the largest championships. Every player dreams of glory, but earning huge prize is a close second.": "很少有游戏是完全为了炫耀权利和臭名昭著而进行的；锦标赛是靠奖金运行的。从最小的比赛到最大的冠军赛，为获胜队伍提供的大量诱人的奖励助长了整个行业的星探、教练和场馆业主。每个球员都梦想着荣誉，但赚取巨额奖金是紧随其后的。",
	"Of course, not all prizes are silver and gold. Siegeball tournaments give out a huge variety of prizes, some of which are detailed here:": "当然，不是所有的奖品都是金银财宝。Siegeball锦标赛发放的奖品种类繁多，这里详细介绍了其中的一些奖品。",
	"Most large, official tournament tournaments give out a trophy of some variety to the winning team. The classic trophy is a gold chalice with a marble base, engraved with the tournament's name and year. Other might include medals, rings, or ribbons, depending on the tournament. The best of teams collect these trophies and display them as badges of honor, but ultimately, they're fairly token. Nearly every trophy is awarded alongside a cash prize, which coaches and team owners view as far more substantial.": "大多数大型的官方锦标赛都会向获胜的队伍颁发某种形式的奖杯。经典的奖杯是一个带有大理石底座的金杯，上面刻有比赛的名称和年份。其他的可能包括奖牌、戒指或丝带，这取决于比赛的情况。最好的团队会收集这些奖杯，并将其作为荣誉徽章展示，但最终，它们是相当象征性的。几乎每个奖杯都是和现金奖一起颁发的，教练和球队老板认为现金奖更有意义。",
	"The actual value of cash prizes might vary, but they generally grow (exceptionally, in fact) with the glamor and prestige of the tournament awarding them. Typical first-place prizes are listed on the cash prizes table below. Often, a second-place prize equal to half the value of the first-place prize is awarded to the runner up team.": "现金奖的实际价值可能会有所不同，但它们通常会随着颁发现金奖的锦标赛的魅力和声望而增长（事实上是异常的）。典型的第一名的奖金列在下面的现金奖表中。通常情况下，第二名的奖金相当于第一名奖金的一半，颁发给亚军队伍。",
	"Other valuable items, equivalent in value to cash prize, might be awarded instead. Anything from magic items, to priceless treasures donated from the king's coffers, to entire keeps or tracks of land could be at stake for the winning team. It is assumed that such prizes will probably be sold (at least in part, if the prize in question can be divided) to pay the team, the coach, and the arena owner sponsoring the team. Other items, like artifacts, might be powerful enough that the fate of many innocents might rely on the winner of the tournament. Though such awards might seem extremely foolhardy, they're not uncommon among the elves, who appreciate the dramatics.": "其他有价值的物品，相当于现金奖励的价值，也可能被授予。从魔法物品，到国王国库中捐赠的无价之宝，再到整个庄园或土地，都可能成为获胜队伍的赌注。我们认为，这些奖品可能会被出售（至少部分出售，如果有关奖品可以分割），以支付球队、教练和赞助球队的竞技场所有者。其他项目，如神器，可能足够强大，许多无辜者的命运可能取决于比赛的获胜者。虽然这样的奖励可能看起来非常愚蠢，但在精灵中并不罕见，他们欣赏这种戏剧性。",
	"One of the more obvious uses for a siegeball tournament is as a wrapper for an entire campaign, as the two match exceedingly well. Campaigns involving siegeball feel very different depending on the party's level, adopting different themes, goals, and villains as the party progresses. This section will cover three different types of siegeball tournament campaigns:": "攻城球比赛的一个更明显的用途是作为整个战役的包装，因为这两者非常匹配。涉及攻城球的战役感觉非常不同，这取决于党派的级别，随着党派的发展，采用不同的主题、目标和反派人物。本节将介绍三种不同类型的攻城球比赛活动。",
	"Before 5th level, siegeball campaigns are bound to be gritty affairs of underground tournaments taking place in dangerous arenas. Until the party achieves enough notoriety to be noticed by a siegeball scout, every day is a struggle for survival. Brutal enemy teams leave them battered and bruised after every game, and lethal weapons like warhammers are brought in regularly. Each game risks life and death, in addition to lifechanging glory.": "在5级之前，攻城球运动必然是在危险的竞技场上进行的地下比赛的狡猾事务。在党派取得足够的声望以被攻城球侦察员注意之前，每天都是为生存而斗争。残酷的敌方队伍在每场比赛后都会让他们遍体鳞伤，而像战锤这样的致命武器也会定期被送来。每场比赛除了改变生命的荣耀外，还有生死的风险。",
	"The party's coach (or owner, as the case may be) will likely be an antagonist in this type of campaign, acting as a driving force to push the party toward ever more dangerous games, while paying them as little as possible, and making escape impossible. The coach is more obsessed with money than safety, and may even place bets against the party in their most perilous games.": "党的教练（或老板，视情况而定）很可能在这种类型的活动中成为对手，作为一种推动力，将党推向越来越危险的游戏，同时尽可能少地支付他们，并使他们无法逃脱。教练对金钱比对安全更着迷，甚至可能在他们最危险的游戏中对他们下注。",
	"The competitors at this level are a combination of the underprivileged athletes with big dreams and criminally violent players that could never advance higher in the game, due to their contempt for authority. A team made exclusive of this latter group might not fare well against the party in winning a game of siegeball, but could easily kill one of them mid-game.": "这个级别的竞争者是拥有伟大梦想的贫困运动员和犯罪暴力的球员的组合，由于他们对权威的蔑视，他们永远不可能在游戏中获得更高的地位。由这后一组人组成的队伍在赢得围攻球比赛时可能不会有好的结果，但在比赛中可以轻易地杀死他们中的一个。",
	"When the party finally attains a modicum of success in the underground siegeball arenas, they'll likely be spotted by a siegeball recruiter for a medium or large city and be signed on a long-term contract. Right away, they'll be gifted new uniforms and equipment, and will be placed in a tournament against vastly more professional teams. With enough skill and daring, the party might rise to the top of their first professional siegeball tournament to become the underdogs with a shot at the top.": "当当事人最终在地下围攻赛场上取得一定的成功时，他们很可能会被一个大中型城市的围攻赛招募者看中，并与之签订长期合同。马上，他们就会得到新的制服和设备，并被安排与更多的专业队伍进行比赛。如果有足够的技巧和胆量，他们可能会在第一次职业攻城球比赛中脱颖而出，成为有机会登顶的弱者。",
	"Traveling from city to city for siegeball games gives the party a chance to explore the campaign world, and opens up possibilities for roadside encounters and diversions from the main tournament. Any distraction that seriously injures a party member or delays the party from reaching the stadium in time could endanger their careers as well, so even sidequests have a measure of potential risk.": "从一个城市到另一个城市参加攻城球比赛，使党有机会探索战役世界，并为路边的遭遇和主要比赛的转移提供了可能性。任何严重伤害党员或拖延党员及时到达体育场的分心行为都可能危及他们的职业生涯，所以即使是副业也有一定的潜在风险。",
	"At this level of the campaign, the ruthlessly competitive opposing teams will rise to become the chief antagonists. This is a great place to insert an experienced rival team who are favored to win the tournament as a foil to the party's underdog standing. Other interesting teams with strong gimmicks are key to pad out the tournament before the final game.": "在这个级别的活动中，竞争无情的对手球队将上升为主要的对立面。这是一个很好的地方，可以插入一个有经验的对手球队，他们被认为可以赢得比赛，作为党的弱势地位的陪衬。其他具有强大噱头的有趣团队是在最后一场比赛前垫定比赛的关键。",
	"Of course, it's possible that the party might find interesting offers coming in from private siegeball arrangements, where 'no rules' games are played behind closed doors for a selected audience. These games are clearly unsafe, and those arranging them seem very suspect, but the lavish pay is enticing nonetheless.": "当然，党可能会发现来自私人围棋安排的有趣提议，在那里，\"没有规则 \"的游戏是闭门为选定的观众进行的。这些游戏显然是不安全的，而且安排这些游戏的人似乎非常可疑，但奢华的报酬还是很诱人。",
	"Lastly, this period of the campaign sees the party achieving their first real fame: they'll be recognized on the street and be asked to sign autographs by die-hard siegeball fans. They're not going to be mobbed by the adoring public quite yet, but this might nonetheless go to their heads.": "最后，在活动的这段时间里，该党首次获得了真正的名声：他们会在街上被认出，并被死忠的围攻者要求签名。他们还不会被崇拜的公众围攻，但这可能会影响到他们的想法。",

	"Additionally, the Championship tends to attract contenders from much further afield, including a host of non-humanoid teams. Teams of djinni and efreeti travel from the Elemental Planes to compete, and a team of driders always rises from to represent the underworld in the competition.

	"Between games is a long, nervous period of practice matches, punctuated by intrigue. Large conspiracies surround the Championship, from hazardous, illegal drugs being taken by other players to enhance their speed and strength, to sinister donors that have entered new teams in the tournament for mysterious reasons, to plots to sabotage the party's chances of victory. If the party wants any chance of winning, investigating and exposing these schemes is critical.": "比赛之间是一段漫长而紧张的练习赛，其间夹杂着阴谋。巨大的阴谋围绕着锦标赛，从其他球员服用危险的非法药物以提高他们的速度和力量，到阴险的捐助者出于神秘的原因在锦标赛中加入新的队伍，到破坏党的胜利机会的阴谋。如果该党想获得任何胜利的机会，调查和揭露这些阴谋是至关重要的。",
	"At this stage of the campaign, the party can be considered superstars. Ordinary people get starstruck around them (even those who don't follow siegeball), and they find it hard to push through crowds before games.

The attacking player may choose which part of the wall it hits, as long as he has a pawn directly in front of it. On his turn, the defending player makes the same roll, but can use the score to repair a piece of the wall. Once a breach in the wall has been made, each player can choose (on their turn) to move one pawn to the other side of the board, by rolling the die.

She recently set up shop, and for the bargain price of 10gp you can have a five-minute conversation with her. As you reach her table, she asks for your name and gestures you to place your coins onto a silver plate. You are instantly overwhelmed by her perfume: incense and myrrh. She pulls out a velvet bag of charmed runestones and shakes them in a cup. She instructs you to think of a question that can be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\".

	"Cackleball is played with a severed goblin head. Before play, the umpire casts {@spell speak with dead} (or {@spell magic mouth}) on the head, causing it to cackle manically during the game. The objective of the sport is to outscore the opposing team by defending the head while it rests atop a small pyramid shaped mound within your own half of the field. Each beat of the drum - roughtly every second - score the team a point. Getting the head to pronounce you the winner is worth a significant 20 points.

	"A collection of amusement shows and activities, often of the transient variety. A travelling carnival moves from location to location, setting up in a new place for a few days or a few weeks. Often, carnivals strike deals with towns and cities in order to set up carnivals during locally recognized celebrations or holidays. Carnivals often include food and merchandise vendors, games of luck, competitions of skill, and acts by humanoid or animal performers.": "一系列的娱乐节目和活动，通常是临时性的。巡回嘉年华会从一个地方移动到另一个地方，在一个新的地方设立几天或几周的时间。通常，嘉年华会与城镇达成协议，以便在当地公认的庆祝活动或节日期间举办嘉年华会。狂欢节通常包括食品和商品供应商、运气游戏、技能竞赛以及人形或动物表演者的表演。",
	"A circus is focused on a performance within a large tent, rather than a variety of tents and booths. Sometimes a part of a carnival, and sometimes an independent act, a circus features performances by humanoids and animals in a wide variety of forms. Though a circus may set up and perform for several days or even weeks, they will have scheduled shows rather than nonstop entertainment.": "马戏团的重点是在一个大帐篷内的表演，而不是各种帐篷和摊位。马戏团有时是狂欢节的一部分，有时是独立的行为，其特点是由人类和动物以各种各样的形式进行表演。尽管一个马戏团可能会在几天甚至几周的时间里进行表演，但他们会有预定的节目，而不是不停地进行娱乐。",
	"Unlike a carnival or circus, a fair is usually put together by the local population of a town or city without contracting outside performers. As such, it will take on a much more \"homey\" feel, focusing on agriculture, animal husbandry, and local crafts and talents.": "与嘉年华会或马戏团不同，集市通常是由一个城镇的当地居民举办的，没有与外部表演者签约。因此，它将呈现出更多的 \"家庭 \"感觉，侧重于农业、畜牧业以及当地的手工艺和人才。",
	"A large meal or banquet held on a holiday in celebration. Though not every group of people has the economic freedom to throw a banquet, \"feasting\" for some could simply mean a communal meal or a special dish associated with the holiday. In some parlance, a \"feast day\" may not even involve food, and instead is related more closely to the term festival.": "在某个节日举行的大餐或宴会，以示庆祝。虽然不是每一群人都有举办宴会的经济自由，但对一些人来说，\"盛宴 \"可能仅仅意味着集体用餐或与节日有关的特殊菜肴。在一些说法中，\"盛宴日 \"甚至可能不涉及食物，而是与节日这个词更密切相关。",
	"A communal celebration. Not strictly limited to holidays, festivals may also be held to celebrate events such as the birth of a royal heir, the changing of seasons, troops returning home from war, or the homecoming of a famed local figure after a journey.": "一个集体的庆祝活动。严格来说，节日并不局限于节假日，也可以为庆祝一些事件而举行，如皇室继承人的出生、季节的变化、军队从战争中归来，或当地著名人物在旅行后的归来。",
	"Derived from the term \"holy day\", a holiday is any day or period of time in which most people are released from work obligations. Holidays need not always have a religious background, and may be of secular nature, or held in remembrance of historical events or mortal figures. Feel free to mix-and-match the materials in this book. A local agricultural fair could still host a fun house, set up by the local craftsmen. A circus might still host a strongman contest, to entertain their audience outside of the tent before the show lets in. A holiday celebration might hold a drinking contest or a pie eating contest as part of the practice of communal feasting. If you're the one designing your celebrations, then there are no limits to them.": "节日源于 \"圣日 \"一词，是大多数人免除工作义务的任何一天或一段时期。节日不一定都有宗教背景，可以是世俗性质的，也可以是为纪念历史事件或凡人而举行的。请自由搭配本书中的材料。当地的农业博览会仍然可以举办一个由当地工匠搭建的游乐场。马戏团可能仍然会举办壮士比赛，在演出开始前在帐篷外为观众提供娱乐。节日庆祝活动可能会举办饮酒比赛或吃馅饼比赛，作为公共宴席做法的一部分。如果你是设计你的庆祝活动的人，那么它们就没有限制。",
	"There are no limits on scale. You could run a city-wide carnival in a metropolis like Waterdeep, with entire streets dedicated to festivities. You could also create a holiday celebrated only in a small town (Chapter 10, Designing Custom Holidays). You might also simply set up a roadside tent with a fortune teller, to provide a touch of foreshadowing to your party, and give them some guidance to get their meandering back on track (Chapter 6, Visiting The Fortune Teller). While this guide is primarily written with the Dungeon Master in mind, there are useful player resources to be had within. Chapter 9 focuses on backgrounds, allowing DMs and players alike to construct characters who have lived their lives embedded in the culture of carnivals, circuses, and performing.": "在规模上没有限制。你可以在Waterdeep这样的大都市举办全城的狂欢节，整个街道都是节日。你也可以创造一个只在小镇上庆祝的节日（第十章，设计自定义节日）。你也可以简单地在路边搭一个帐篷，里面有一个算命先生，为你的队伍提供一丝预示，并给他们一些指导，让他们的游荡回到正轨（第6章，拜访算命先生）。虽然本指南主要是以地下城主为中心编写的，但其中也有一些有用的玩家资源。第9章侧重于背景，让管理员和玩家都能构建那些生活在狂欢节、马戏团和表演文化中的角色。",

	"Adventurers live very unique lives, in that they have more opportunities to travel and visit new lands than average folk.

	"Many circus performances throughout history have relied on the exhibition of \"freaks\", or rather, people with unusual appearances. Often, this included people who were exceptionally tall or exceptionally short, fat people, people of different ethnicities, or people who suffered some sort of physical deformity. As modern sensitivities have developed, we've accepted that this can be a very harmful mistreatment of people who suffer from disability or deformity, and the practice of paying to view a \"freak\" contributed to their dehumanization.": "历史上许多马戏团的表演都依赖于 \"怪人 \"的展示，或者说，具有不寻常外表的人。通常，这包括特别高或特别矮的人、胖子、不同种族的人，或遭受某种身体畸形的人。随着现代敏感性的发展，我们已经接受，这可能是对患有残疾或畸形的人非常有害的虐待，而付费观看 \"怪胎 \"的做法促成了他们的非人化。",
	"If you want to keep your carnival setting tasteful, try to avoid classic characters like \"the fat lady\", \"the giant\", \"conjoined twins\" or \"the bearded lady\" (who may not even be out of the ordinary depending on how your setting handles dwarven physiology). Instead focus on performers who actively do things, or capitalize on an appearance that they chose for themselves, such as extreme body modification. Giving a person agency in their lives can make a big difference in the way they are portrayed.": "如果你想让你的狂欢节设置保持品味，尽量避免像 \"胖女人\"、\"巨人\"、\"连体婴儿 \"或 \"大胡子女人 \"这样的经典角色（根据你的设置如何处理矮人的生理结构，他们甚至可能并不出格）。相反，要关注那些积极做事的表演者，或者利用他们为自己选择的外表，例如极端的身体改造。赋予一个人在生活中的代理权可以使他们的形象大为改观。",
	"From tightrope walking, to tumbling, to trapeze, and any other variety of dextrous bodily performance, acrobats steal the show. The earliest recorded performances involved acrobats performing feats of limberness and balance while riding on the backs of bulls, or balancing on their hands while firing bows and arrows with their feet. Today, ingenuity and creativity have lead to acrobats performing on rings, ropes, or swaths of silk suspended from ceilings, tree limbs, and tent posts, high above the heads of an awe-struck audience.": "从走钢丝到翻跟头，再到空中飞人，以及其他各种灵活的身体表演，杂技演员抢尽了风头。最早的表演记录涉及杂技演员在骑在公牛背上时进行的柔韧和平衡的表演，或在用脚发射弓箭时用手保持平衡。今天，独创性和创造性已经导致杂技演员在天花板、树枝和帐篷柱上悬挂的吊环、绳索或丝绸上进行表演，高高在上，令观众惊叹不已。",
	"The best performers are the ones the onlookers don't realize are putting on a show. Carnies, or \"showies\" as some may call them, are responsible for setting up equipment, running games, vending food and toys, and every other requirement of making the carnival actually work. They may make themselves obvious by calling passersbys to try their hand at games or competitions, or keep themselves scarce when setting up equipment, props, and decor for upcoming performances. Carnies are the backbone of the carnival, and are also a playable background (see pg. 22).": "最好的表演者是那些旁观者没有意识到在表演的人。卡尼们，或者有些人称他们为 \"表演者\"，负责设置设备、运行游戏、出售食物和玩具，以及使嘉年华会实际运作的所有其他要求。他们可能会通过召集路人参加游戏或比赛来显露自己的身份，或者在为即将到来的表演设置设备、道具和装饰时保持沉默。车夫是嘉年华会的骨干，也是一个可玩的背景（见第22页）。",
	"Though perhaps not as eye-catching as many of the other performers, the ringmaster has an extremely important duty. Functioning as the \"master of ceremonies\", they are essentially using their charisma to pull off a massive feat of \"sleight of hand\". Though a performance may come across as snappy or explosive, most performances require some degree of setup to perform properly and safely. Thus, the ringmaster guides the audience's attention away from a trick being set up or broken down, and toward a new highlight of entertainment.": "虽然可能不像其他许多表演者那样引人注目，但司仪有一个极其重要的职责。作为 \"司仪\"，他们基本上是利用自己的魅力来完成一个巨大的 \"魔术 \"壮举。虽然一个表演可能会表现得很爽快或很有爆发力，但大多数表演都需要一定程度的设置才能正常和安全地进行。因此，司仪将观众的注意力从正在设置或分解的魔术上转移到新的娱乐亮点上。",
	"While acrobats and gymnasts may perform feats that require flexibility, a contortionist specializes in being able to twist their body into knots. Most contortionists specialize in frontbending or back-bending, and some may also practice displays of contorting to fit within small spaces (like a box or trunk), or dislocating joints (\"bone-breaking\" to the uninformed).": "杂技演员和体操运动员可能会表演需要柔韧性的节目，而柔术师的专长是能够将身体扭曲成结。大多数柔术师擅长前弯或后弯，有些人还可能练习在狭小的空间（如箱子或树干）内扭曲身体，或使关节脱臼（不知情的人称之为 \"断骨\"）的展示。",
	"In a world where \"breathing fire\" is relegated to the realms of Dragonborn or magic (Potion of Fire Breath, DMG pg. 187), fire breathers and fire eaters must draw particular attention to the fact that they utilize no magic in the performing of their arts. Furthermore, while a Dragonborn may utilize breath weapons, even a fire-breathing sort is not immune to fire, making the supposed \"eating\" of flame still impressive. In reality, what they do requires very little special equipment, but instead a great deal of practice and a slightly more advanced knowledge of the sciences than most people (IE \"heat rises\", \"fire requires oxygen\", and so on).": "在这个世界上，\"喷火 \"被归为龙族或魔法的范畴（喷火药水，DMG第187页），喷火者和吃火者必须特别注意他们在表演他们的艺术时没有利用魔法。此外，虽然龙裔可以使用呼吸武器，但即使是喷火者也不能对火免疫，这使得所谓的 \"吃 \"火焰仍然令人印象深刻。实际上，他们所做的事情几乎不需要什么特殊的设备，而是需要大量的练习和比大多数人略微高级的科学知识（IE \"热量上升\"，\"火需要氧气\"，等等）。",
	"Generally speaking, a magician by themselves is not going to be particularly interesting in most settings. Unless you're working from a \"low magic\" setting in which common folk know of the existence of magic and yet rarely ever see it, your magicians will either have to pull off extraordinary feats, or appear to break known laws of magic.": "一般来说，在大多数情况下，魔术师本身不会特别有趣。除非你是在一个 \"低魔法 \"的环境中工作，普通人知道魔法的存在，但却很少看到它，否则你的魔术师要么必须完成非凡的壮举，要么看起来要打破已知的魔法规律。",
	"Shabbily dressed performers who carry on simple plays. The most classic play revolves around two combatants fighting each other to the death, such as a knight and a dragon, and a quack doctor who comes along to revive the fallen loser. Mummers deliver their narratives in rhyming couplets, and the plays generally do not require any special scenery or props beyond what the actors can carry on their person. This form of amateur acting is so popular and widespread that mummers are also a playable background (see pg. 23).": "衣着简陋的表演者，进行简单的戏剧表演。最经典的剧目是围绕着两个战斗人员的生死搏斗，如骑士和龙，以及一个前来救治失败者的庸医。姆默斯人用押韵的对联进行叙述，除了演员可以随身携带的东西外，戏剧一般不需要任何特殊的场景或道具。这种形式的业余表演非常流行和广泛，以至于姆默斯也是一种可玩的背景（见第23页）。",
	"Large, muscular men (or women, or anything really) who perform great feats of strength before an audience. Though extraordinarily strong creatures exist in the world, the strongman's performance hinges on convincing their audience that no ordinary person could do what they do. They most often secure this point by inviting a member of the audience to attempt the feat of strength first, and fail at it. Sometimes, the audience member is a \"plant\" (a carnie pretending to be an ordinary commoner) who is in on the gimmick, and knows how to fail spectacularly enough in front of an audience that even a rigged \"feat of strength\" could appear convincing.": "大块的、肌肉发达的男人（或女人，或任何东西，真的）在观众面前表现出巨大的力量。虽然世界上存在特别强壮的生物，但强人的表演取决于让观众相信没有一个普通人能做到他们所做的。他们通常通过邀请一名观众首先尝试力量的壮举，并且失败来确保这一点。有时，这个观众是一个 \"植物人\"（假装成普通人的卡尼），他参与了这个噱头，并知道如何在观众面前足够壮观地失败，即使是一个被操纵的 \"力量壮举 \"也会显得令人信服。",
	"Humanoid talents are not the only attraction of a circus or carnival. Though most people live in relatively close proximity to animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc), their pets or beasts of burden are generally trained only for specific tasks. Thus, the draw of \"a dog who can count\" or a horse who performs tricks can draw many to buy a ticket.": "人形人才不是马戏团或狂欢节的唯一吸引力。虽然大多数人生活在相对接近动物（狗、猫、马等）的地方，但他们的宠物或野兽一般只为特定任务而训练。因此，\"会数数的狗 \"或会表演技巧的马的抽奖可以吸引很多人买票。",
	"Performances of trained animals can take on many forms. The most classic examples may consist of dogs playing leapfrog, lions jumping through hoops, or elephants lifting humanoid gymnastic performers on their trunks. However, in a magical world, these marvelous feats of training might take on entirely different connotations. Druids using Speak With Animals can simply ask a bear to stand up and hold still while they balance a stack of spinning plates on his head. Animal training now becomes more of a matter of making friends and building trust, without having to worry about communicating what you want to a creature that can't understand.": "训练有素的动物的表演可以有多种形式。最经典的例子可能包括狗玩跳跃游戏，狮子跳圈，或大象用树干举起人形体操表演者。然而，在一个魔法世界里，这些奇妙的训练壮举可能具有完全不同的内涵。使用 \"与动物对话 \"的德鲁伊可以简单地要求一只熊站起来并保持不动，而他们在熊的头上平衡一摞旋转的盘子。动物训练现在变得更像是一个交朋友和建立信任的问题，而不必担心向一个无法理解的生物传达你想要什么。",
	"On the other hand, a polymorph spell could simply allow a humanoid who's learned their choreography to appear to be an especially well-trained animal. Keep in mind that, depending on how \"low magic\" or \"high magic\" your setting is, commoners may be considerably more impressed with animal tricks than an adventurer who's aware of such spells might be. If magic is commonplace in your setting, your circus performers may have to pull off considerably more impressive feats of animal training in order to wow their crowds.": "另一方面，一个多面体法术可以简单地让一个学会了他们编排的人形生物看起来是一个特别训练有素的动物。请记住，根据你的设定是 \"低魔法 \"还是 \"高魔法\"，平民可能比了解此类法术的冒险者对动物表演的印象要好得多。如果魔法在你的环境中很普遍，你的马戏团表演者可能不得不在动物训练方面做出更多令人印象深刻的壮举，以使他们的观众惊叹。",
	"Sometimes, it's not what an animal can do that is impressive, but merely their presence that can inspire awe and wonder in onlookers. Many common folk with live their entire lives within a relatively short distance of where they were born, and will never have the opportunity to travel abroad and see exotic creatures. When the menagerie comes into town, they'll be able to see all manner of wild creatures that they've only ever heard of in stories.": "有时，令人印象深刻的不是动物能做什么，而仅仅是它们的存在能激发旁观者的敬畏和惊奇。许多普通人一生都生活在他们出生地相对较短的距离内，永远没有机会到国外旅行，看到异国的生物。当动物园进城时，他们就能看到他们只在故事中听说过的各种野生动物。",
	"There's a significant difference between a travelling menagerie and one that is stationary. A single location (sometimes called an animal park or zoological garden) will often make efforts to display animals in environments similar to their native homes. Various feats of magic, technology, or simply importing flora from the animal's place of origin, may be used to accomplish this. Travelling menageries, however, are often limited to placing animals in cages small enough to be transported on wagons.": "旅行动物园和固定的动物园之间有很大区别。一个单一的地点（有时被称为动物公园或动物园）通常会努力在类似于其原生地的环境中展示动物。为了达到这个目的，可以使用各种魔法、技术，或者干脆从动物的原产地进口植物。然而，旅行动物园通常只限于将动物放在足够小的笼子里，以便用马车运输。",
	"Whatever form a menagerie takes, it generally is not as ideal as letting animals roam comfortably in their wild homes. For this reason, some people (especially those of the druidic persuasion) may be opposed to the practice of keeping animals captive for the amusement of humanoids. On the other hand, some menageries may fake their exotic display by utilizing magic, ranging from illusions to polymorphed entertainers.": "无论动物园采取什么形式，它通常都不如让动物在它们的野外家园舒适地漫游来得理想。因此，有些人（尤其是德鲁伊教派的人）可能会反对将动物圈养起来供人类娱乐的做法。另一方面，一些动物园可能会利用魔法来伪造其异国情调的展示，从幻觉到多面体的艺人。",
	"Though seeing an exotic animal from afar can be an amazing experience for many common folk, nothing quite beats being able to touch, feed, and pet an animal. However, putting wild animals and untrained people in close proximity to one another can be a dangerous gamble. For this reason, petting zoos often have to strike a balance between wild animals and safe animals. Interestingly enough, petting zoos can be more interesting to noble children than they would be to commoner children. Nobles will have more opportunities to travel and see exotic animals that a commoner would never see, but most commoners will deal with livestock on a relatively regular basis. Thus, a noble child may be enamoured with the opportunity to pet a pig or feed a goat, whereas a child raised on a farm would find nothing special about it.": "尽管对许多普通人来说，从远处看到异国动物是一种神奇的体验，但没有什么比能够触摸、喂养和抚摸动物更有意义的了。然而，把野生动物和未经训练的人放在一起，可能是一场危险的赌博。出于这个原因，宠物动物园通常必须在野生动物和安全动物之间取得平衡。有趣的是，对贵族儿童来说，宠物园可能比对平民儿童更有趣。贵族会有更多的机会去旅行，看到平民永远看不到的异国动物，但大多数平民会相对经常地与牲畜打交道。因此，一个贵族的孩子可能会迷上抚摸猪或喂羊的机会，而一个在农场长大的孩子会觉得这没什么特别的。",
	"Inspired by the \"carosella\", meaning \"little battle\", which originated as a cavalry training exercise. Originally, mounted soldiers would gallop in circles while tossing balls to one another, forcing them to sharpen their riding skills. The sight of armored knights on horseback was so enthralling to children, that the concept of the carousel was born. At a carousel, horses are tethered to a center post, so that they can only walk in a circular track. The horses may be covered in ornate finery, displaying colorful bridles and barding, and some horses may be ridden by costumed performers to carry on the illusion that children are riding among nobles or knights. Always seeking to stand out from the crowd, some carousel proprietors experiment with other creatures, such as camels, elephants, or riding mastiffs. The creativity of their mounts is limited only by the safety of the wild creatures they're dealing with. Some have also been known to affix fake horns to a horse's ornate head tack, in order to market themselves as having a carousel of unicorns. ": "灵感来自于 \"carosella\"，意思是 \"小战斗\"，它起源于一种骑兵训练。最初，骑马的士兵会绕着圈子飞奔，同时互相抛球，迫使他们磨练自己的骑马技巧。马背上的盔甲骑士的景象让孩子们非常着迷，因此旋转木马的概念应运而生。在旋转木马上，马匹被拴在一个中心柱子上，因此它们只能在一个圆形轨道上行走。马匹可能覆盖着华丽的装饰，展示着五颜六色的辔头和护套，有些马匹可能由化装的表演者骑着，以延续儿童在贵族或骑士中骑马的幻觉。为了从人群中脱颖而出，一些旋转木马的经营者尝试使用其他生物，如骆驼、大象或骑獒。他们的坐骑的创造力只受限于他们所面对的野生动物的安全。有些人还知道在马的华丽头饰上贴上假角，以推销自己拥有独角兽的旋转木马。",
	"Among the many structures set up at a carnival, the funhouse is perhaps the most eclectic of all. The entire premise of a funhouse is that it's fully enclosed, and people on the outside will pay to sate their curiosity of whatever lays within. The interior of a funhouse can take on many themes or present many experiences.": "在嘉年华会的众多建筑中，游乐场可能是最不拘一格的。游乐场的整个前提是它是完全封闭的，外面的人可以花钱来满足他们对里面的东西的好奇心。游乐场的内部可以有许多主题或呈现许多体验。",
	"{@b Hall Of Mirrors} - A simple \"maze\" of mirrored walls, presenting a challenge of traversal simply by the fact there are so many optical illusions. Many of the mirrors are warped, and will present the illusion that people are taller, shorter, thinner, or broader in their reflection. More wealthy carnivals may be able to afford magic mirrors that present more elaborate reflections, such as showing the viewer what they looked like in their youth, or what they might look like as a warrior, a royal, etc.": "{@b Hall Of Mirrors} - 一个由镜子组成的简单的 \"迷宫\"，仅仅因为有这么多的视觉错觉而带来了穿越的挑战。许多镜子都是扭曲的，会呈现出人更高、更矮、更瘦或更宽的错觉。更富裕的嘉年华会可能有能力购买魔镜，以呈现更多精心制作的反射，例如向观众展示他们年轻时的样子，或者他们作为战士、皇室成员的样子，等等。",
	"{@b Haunted House} - A themed funhouse that is presented as being \"haunted\", in which various contraptions or costumed actors attempt to scare or startle those passing through. Though still fully enclosed, a \"haunted\" funhouse will have many darkened windows or thinner walls, to allow the screams of the horrified audience to echo outward, drawing more curious viewers to purchase a ticket. Sometimes, carnies will disguise themselves as ordinary attendees in order to be abducted by a \"ghost\" or \"monster\" in front of others, presenting the illusion of danger.": "{@b Haunted House} - 一个以 \"闹鬼 \"为主题的游乐场，其中有各种装置或化装演员试图吓唬或惊吓那些经过的人。虽然仍然是完全封闭的，但 \"闹鬼 \"的游乐场会有许多黑暗的窗户或较薄的墙壁，以便让惊恐的观众的尖叫声向外回响，吸引更多好奇的观众来买票。有时，笑匠会把自己伪装成普通观众，以便在别人面前被 \"鬼 \"或 \"怪物 \"绑架，呈现出危险的幻觉。",
	"{@b Barrel Roll} - A tunnel section of the funhouse is in fact a large barrel on its side, which is spun by workers on the outside. Guests attempting to traverse the hall must try to walk at an angle in order to not be sent tumbling.": "{@b Barrel Roll} - 游乐场的一个隧道部分实际上是一个侧面的大木桶，由外面的工人旋转着。试图穿越大厅的客人必须尽量以一定的角度行走，以避免被送入翻滚中。",

	"Though often too difficult to set up on demand, a log flume ride can be a charming part of an agricultural fair.

	"During a fair, the lumber mill will often be shut down to allow workers time off to celebrate and relax.

	"If we were to follow the rules of modern archery competitions, we'd be running a very boring sort of contest. Each competitor would be given several dozen arrows to fire at a target, at increasingly shorter distances, for several rounds. This turns into somewhere between roughly 100 and 150 dice-rolls per competitor, if scored accurately. So instead of playing \"the long game\", our archery competitions endeavor to make a shorter contest more exciting.": "如果我们遵循现代射箭比赛的规则，我们将进行一种非常无聊的比赛。每位参赛者将得到几十支箭，以越来越短的距离射向一个目标，进行几轮比赛。如果准确计分的话，这就变成了每个参赛者大约100到150次掷骰子。因此，我们的射箭比赛不是玩 \"长游戏\"，而是努力使较短的比赛更加精彩。",
	"We're going to limit our formal options to shortbow, excluding heavy crossbows and the longbow from competition. By building our competition around a weapon with an effective range of 80 feet and a maximum range of 320, it keeps the playing field significantly smaller and easier to manage. This also gives room for hand crossbow and dagger-throwing characters to petition for entry to competitions, should you so desire. They'll be competing at a marked disadvantage, but they'll still have a fighting chance, and nothing feels cooler than beating the odds.": "我们要把正式的选择限制在短弓上，把重弩和长弓排除在竞争之外。通过围绕一种有效射程为80英尺、最大射程为320英尺的武器建立我们的比赛，可以使比赛场地明显缩小，更容易管理。这也为手弩和匕首投掷角色申请参加比赛提供了空间，如果你愿意的话。他们将在竞争中处于明显的劣势，但他们仍然有一个战斗的机会，没有什么比战胜困难的感觉更酷了。",
	"That being said, you're welcome to take the provided rules and modify them to work with longer-ranged weaponry, custom weapons like guns, etc.When most people think of an archery competition, they think of competitors standing in a row, shooting at targets at a fixed location, each trying to land their shot as close to the bullseye as possible.

	"In standard combat, the only ranges that matter for shooting a bow are effective range, and maximum range. However, it's important to remember that in combat, hitting a target with a powerful strike is generally more important than exactly where the target is hit; hitting a particular location is generally the realm of narrative freedom in 5th edition. For most enemies, a matter of an inch or two difference in the location of the hit is inconsequential to the damage being dealt. In target-shooting competition however, an inch or two can determine who's standing on the podium in the end. Thus, the ACs for different rings of the target will vary based on the distance from the target. ": "在标准战斗中，对弓箭射击来说，唯一重要的范围是有效范围和最大范围。然而，重要的是要记住，在战斗中，以强大的攻击力击中目标通常比目标被击中的确切位置更重要；在第五版中，击中一个特定的位置通常是叙述的自由领域。对于大多数敌人来说，被击中的位置相差一两英寸对所造成的伤害是无足轻重的。然而在打靶比赛中，一两英寸就能决定谁能站在最后的领奖台上。因此，目标的不同环的AC值将根据与目标的距离而变化。",
	"If one of your players has taken the Sharpshooter feat, they will have several benefits that may help them edge out other shooters. One of these is the opportunity to take a penalty to an attack roll, but if it hits, they can add a large bonus to the attack's damage. Choosing to take a penalty on an attack role in a competition focused on accuracy may be a dangerous risk, but if you have a player who decides to go for it, make sure you reward them for a success! If they strike the target, and make a reasonably high damage roll, let them split or splinter the wooden target. Of course, don't prompt them to do this, or let them know it's an option...

	"Food is a part of many holidays and festivals, and eating large amounts of food is considered a primary method of celebration by many. It stands to reason that someone's competitive nature meant an eating contest would be born. Typically, eating contests select a single food item as their focus. Pies are common, as they are made to a uniform size and density. However, any food could be used, ranging from apples, to ears of corn, to giant turkey legs. Judges are always on hand to ensure that the food is fully consumed, and an excess of food is not left behind (pie crust still in the pan, meat left on a bone, etc). Competitors are disqualified if they stand from the table, pass out at the table, or if they throw up. The last competitor still eating, wins. Competitors in a pie eating contest make Constitution saves for each pie they eat, with the DC steadily raising for each pie eaten. If a competitor fails their Constitution save, they are given the \"full\" status. They may continue to compete if they wish, but additional saves will be made with disadvantage. Failing another Constitution save after becoming full, will cause the competitor to vomit (or pass out, if you feel players at your table may be squeamish).": "食物是许多假期和节日的一部分，吃大量的食物被许多人认为是庆祝的主要方法。按理说，有人的竞争天性意味着会有饮食比赛的诞生。通常情况下，饮食比赛选择一种单一的食品作为其重点。馅饼很常见，因为它们的大小和密度都是统一的。然而，任何食物都可以使用，从苹果、玉米穗到巨型火鸡腿。裁判员总是在现场，以确保食物被完全吃完，并且没有留下多余的食物（饼皮还在锅里，肉留在骨头上，等等）。如果参赛者从桌子上站起来，在桌子上晕倒，或者呕吐，就会被取消资格。最后一个仍在吃的参赛者获胜。吃饼比赛的参赛者每吃一个饼都要进行宪法拯救，每吃一个饼，DC就会稳步提高。如果参赛者没有通过体质救赎，他们将被授予 \"完全 \"状态。如果他们愿意，他们可以继续参加比赛，但额外的救赎将以不利的方式进行。饱食之后，如果再一次救赎失败，将导致竞争者呕吐（或昏迷，如果你觉得你的桌子上的玩家可能会胆怯）。",
	"If your competitors somehow make it past round 10, continue to add 5 to the DC for each additional round of eating.

The goal of a sheep-shearing race is for each competitor to shear every sheep in their pen as quickly as possible without causing injury.": "在典型的农场环境中，由于可以使用较热的水，所以在剪毛后要对羊群进行清洗。出于比赛的目的，羊群要事先清洗，以去除植物物质、毛刺、污垢等。挑选羊只时，要看其绒毛的大小和生长情况是否一致，并将其分到几个羊圈。剪羊毛比赛的目的是让每个参赛者在不造成伤害的情况下尽可能快地剪掉自己羊圈里的每只羊。",
	"When running a sheep-shearing race, competitors roll 1d20 per round, adding their Dexterity Bonus or Wisdom (Animal Handling). This number is kept, and added to for each subsequent round. The first competitor to reach 80pts wins the race. If two characters reach 80pts on the same round, the one who exceeded 80 by the highest number wins by mere seconds.

	"Instead of counting each individual sheep, or timing exactly how long it takes, each rolled round of sheep-shearing roughly illustrates how efficiently a competitor is working. As long as no one is shearing sheep in the same initiative order as a nearby round of combat, the fact that it no longer adheres to the \"six-second turn\" model is inconsequential.": "与其计算每只羊的数量，或者精确计算所需时间，每一轮滚动的剪羊毛都大致说明了竞争者的工作效率如何。只要没有人以与附近一轮战斗相同的主动权顺序来剪羊毛，不再遵守 \"六秒回合 \"模式这一事实就无关紧要。",
	"When performed properly, sheep are not injured in the shearing process. A struggling sheep might earn a nick or two, but a proper farmer will see that any injuries are treated to prevent infection and harm to their flock. After all, their flock is their livelihood. As mentioned above, the goal is to shear sheep as quickly as possible without causing injury.": "如果操作得当，羊群不会在剪羊毛的过程中受伤。挣扎的羊可能会挣到一两个缺口，但一个合适的农民会看到任何伤害都得到治疗，以防止感染和对羊群的伤害。毕竟，他们的羊群是他们的生计。如上所述，目标是在不造成伤害的情况下尽快剪掉羊群。",
	"Animal cruelty is a subject that can easily provoke a negative emotional response. Even people who have never owned pets or been close to animals themselves, tend to feel a distaste for the idea of causing needless harm to an animal, especially if that animal isn't aggressive. Though it would be reasonable to apply a penalty for injuring a sheep in the course of the shearing race, instead, we work off of the assumption that a struggling sheep simply {@i wastes more time}, in the shearer's effort not to cause injury. Though your mileage may vary, we felt this was the best method of avoiding a provoking subject.": "虐待动物是一个很容易激起负面情绪反应的话题。即使是那些从未养过宠物或自己接近过动物的人，也会对对动物造成无谓伤害的想法感到厌恶，特别是在那个动物没有攻击性的情况下。虽然在剪羊毛的过程中，对受伤的羊进行惩罚是合理的，但我们的做法是，假设挣扎的羊只是{@i wastes more time}，在剪羊毛的人努力不造成伤害。尽管你的想法可能有所不同，但我们认为这是避免挑衅性话题的最佳方法。",
	"On a standard dairy farm, cows are milked two to three times a day, and may produce as much as six or seven gallons of milk a day. The process of milking a cow requires good grip, strong arms, and a steady pace. Of course, it also involves working in extremely close proximity to a live, large animal, which comes with its own set of challenges. Cow milking competitions involve cows being carefully tethered to keep them in one place, and buckets are provided with goal lines marked on the inside. The first competitor to fill their bucket to the goal line, wins.": "在一个标准的奶牛场，奶牛每天要挤两到三次奶，每天的产奶量可能高达6或7加仑。给奶牛挤奶的过程需要良好的握力、有力的手臂和稳定的步伐。当然，这也涉及到在极其接近活生生的大动物的情况下工作，这就有了自己的一系列挑战。奶牛挤奶比赛涉及将奶牛小心翼翼地拴在一个地方，并提供水桶，里面标有目标线。第一个将水桶装到目标线的参赛者获胜。",

	"Cows can be easily spooked, and competition environments with strangers trying to milk them can make them especially nervous. If you want to add an extra layer of difficulty to the game, you can consider adding unique events for low rolls. These can range from cows struggling and squirming too much to be milked (losing a turn), kicking over the bucket (resetting their score to 0), or even kicking the competitor (1d4 bludgeoning damage). Simply consider how cruel you're willing to be to your players.": "奶牛很容易受到惊吓，而有陌生人试图挤奶的竞争环境会让它们特别紧张。如果你想给游戏增加一层难度，你可以考虑为低卷添加独特的事件。这些事件的范围包括：奶牛挣扎和扭动得太厉害而无法挤奶（失去一个回合），踢翻水桶（将它们的分数重置为0），甚至踢到竞争者（1d4重击伤害）。只需考虑你愿意对你的玩家有多残忍。",
	"Though some farmers keep their pigs in organized pens, some allow them to run freely in cool, boggy areas. Feeding time requires the farmers to call their free-roaming pigs back to them, and over time, farmers have learned that pigs respond to loud, shrill sounds (perhaps resembling a piglet squealing). Thus, competition to see who could encourage their pigs to return the fastest, was born.": "虽然有些农民把猪关在有组织的围栏里，但有些农民允许猪在凉爽的沼泽地里自由奔跑。喂食时间要求农民把自由奔跑的猪叫回来，随着时间的推移，农民了解到，猪对响亮的、尖锐的声音（也许类似于小猪的尖叫声）有反应。因此，看谁能鼓励他们的猪最快回来的竞争就诞生了。",
	"When running a pig calling contest, competitors take turns instead of going simultaneously. Competitors roll 1d20 per round, adding their Charisma Bonus or Wisdom (Animal Handling).

	"Whether or not you consider magic spells to be legal or illegal in the contest, is up to your discretion. If a spellcaster uses {@spell Speak With Animals}, you may give them advantage on all of their pig calling rolls. For the purpose of the contest, pigs are considered medium creatures (like wild boars), therefore not affected by the Forest Gnome's Speak With Small Beasts racial feature": "在比赛中，你是否认为法术是合法或非法的，由你来决定。如果施法者使用{@spell Speak With Animals}，你可以让他们在所有召唤猪的卷轴上取得优势。在比赛中，猪被认为是中等生物（如野猪），因此不受森林地精的 \"与小兽交谈 \"种族特征的影响。",
	"Many carnival games are, in fact, rigged. They are designed to make it appear easy to win, but use tricks of perspective, distraction, and faulty equipment to tilt the games in favor of the operators rather than the players. Furthermore, many carnies provide examples of the games being played to show how \"easily\" they can be won, at least, with their added benefit of standing in a different location than the players, knowing exactly where to hit, or using different equipment.": "许多狂欢节游戏事实上是被操纵的。它们被设计成看起来很容易赢，但却利用视角、分心和有缺陷的设备等技巧，使游戏向有利于经营者而非玩家的方向倾斜。此外，许多车夫提供游戏的例子，以显示它们是多么 \"容易 \"获胜，至少，他们的额外好处是站在与玩家不同的位置，确切地知道该打哪里，或使用不同的设备。",
	"Carnival games should always have a cost to play. This cost is at your discretion, and may vary based on the clientele of the carnival; nobles may be willing to pay up to 1gp per game to try their hand, whereas a carnival catering to commoners may only be able to get away with 5cp or 1sp per game.": "狂欢节游戏应该总是有成本的。这个费用由你决定，并可能根据嘉年华会的客户群而有所不同；贵族可能愿意为每场游戏支付高达1gp的费用，而为平民服务的嘉年华会可能只能以每场5cp或1sp的价格成交。",
	"It's theorized that the \"sport\" of jumping on the back of an illtempered bull and trying to hold on for as long as possible was originally pioneered by farmhands, borne of a mixture of boredom and drunkenness.

	"Unlike many carnival games, the bucking bull is never rigged per say, but instead, the carnies hawking the challenge suggest that the rider must only stay on for a very brief period of time, and that it can't be that hard. In truth, it is actually that hard.": "与许多狂欢节游戏不同的是，斗牛从来没有被操纵过，相反，兜售这一挑战的狂欢者暗示，骑手必须只在很短的时间内停留，而且不可能那么难。事实上，它实际上是很难的。",
	"The goal is to remain on the gorgon for eight rounds, making strength-opposed grapple checks against the bucking monstrosity. For the purposes of this contest, the rule that creatures cannot grapple a creature more than one size larger them no longer applies; they are holding onto the saddle, not the gorgon itself. Therefore, small sized creatures may enter at their own risk.": "我们的目标是在高竿上停留8个回合，对这只降压的怪兽进行力量对抗的抓捕检查。在这场比赛中，生物不能抓取比自己大一号的生物的规则不再适用；他们抓的是马鞍，而不是高脚龙本身。因此，小体型的生物可以参加，但风险自负。",

	"In general, a holiday is a day determined by law or tradition, commemorating an important historic event. Most businesses close, and any job that is not an essential service (town guards, healers, etc) is reduced or suspended for the day.

	"Many holidays are comprised of more than just the event itself. Traditions become associated with holidays over time, and will reflect decor, food, music, games, gift-giving, and other practices.": "许多节日不仅仅是由活动本身组成的。随着时间的推移，传统会与节日联系在一起，并反映出装饰、食物、音乐、游戏、礼物赠送和其他做法。",
	"The date on the calendar is an important element of designing your holiday, as decor will often be influenced by signs of the season. A harvest festival will likely use autumnal colors, while a spring festival will use bright colors and myriad green shades to represent new life and growth.": "日历上的日期是设计节日的一个重要因素，因为装饰往往会受到季节迹象的影响。一个收获的节日可能会使用秋天的颜色，而一个春天的节日会使用明亮的颜色和无数的绿色色调来代表新的生命和成长。",
	"The climate will also play a distinct factor in how a holiday is celebrated. Holidays during heavily rainy seasons will likely be indoor affairs, focusing on togetherness. Holidays during the hottest weather will often involve ways to keep cool.": "气候也会对节日的庆祝方式起到明显的影响。在多雨的季节里，节日可能是室内活动，重点是团结一致。在最热的天气里，节日往往会涉及到保持凉爽的方法。",
	"Some holidays are held in remembrance of people or events. When remembering people, these holidays are often composed posthumously, and great figures in history are celebrated after their death. As such, the holiday could be celebrated on the day they died, the day they performed a great feat, or it could be celebrated on their birthday.": "有些节日是为了纪念人或事件而举行的。在纪念人时，这些节日往往是在死后组成的，历史上的伟大人物都是在死后庆祝的。因此，节日可以在他们去世的那一天庆祝，也可以在他们完成伟大壮举的那一天庆祝，还可以在他们的生日庆祝。",

Very often, a solemn ceremony or religious service will be held early in the day, followed by more joyous celebrations in the afternoon and evening.": "尽管追悼会可能是一个严肃的事务，但这并不意味着庆祝活动中不能有任何轻松的气氛。很多时候，庄严的仪式或宗教仪式将在当天早些时候举行，然后在下午和晚上举行更多欢乐的庆祝活动。",
	"The oppression or ownership of any person is a terrible thing. Worse still is when these acts of oppression or slavery are sanctioned or even enforced by governing powers. Obtaining one's freedom is usually a bloody affair, and requires not only the defeat of slavers, but the overturning of laws and social perceptions that make such oppression possible at its core. An economy built on slave-labor is generally not willing to just give slaves their freedom peacefully, and very often, they've built the mindset that their slaves are \"lesser beings\" that are either undeserving of their freedom, or might be dangerous if freed.": "对任何人的压迫或所有权是一件可怕的事情。更糟糕的是，当这些压迫或奴役行为得到执政者的认可甚至强制执行的时候。获得自由通常是一件血腥的事情，不仅需要打败奴隶主，还需要推翻使这种压迫成为可能的法律和社会观念的核心。一个建立在奴隶劳动基础上的经济体通常不愿意和平地给予奴隶自由，而且往往他们已经建立了这样的心态：他们的奴隶是 \"低等生物\"，要么不值得他们获得自由，要么如果获得自由可能是危险的。",
	"Even a bloodless rebellion will often involve great hardships, such as fleeing over great distances, hiding in dangerous wilderness or climates, and long periods of uncertainty before being able to settle again. Thus, these celebrations can be vitally important for embracing the freedom and peace of mind that one's ancestors were denied.": "即使是不流血的叛乱，也往往会涉及巨大的困难，如远距离逃亡，躲藏在危险的荒野或气候中，以及在能够重新定居之前的漫长的不确定性。因此，这些庆祝活动对于拥抱自己的祖先被剥夺的自由和心灵的平静可能是极其重要的。",
	"Celebrating freedom from slavery and oppression is often a mixture of both solemn memorial, and jubilant celebration. Leaders and resistors who fought for their freedom are remembered, as well as mourning for those who died before seeing their people achieve freedom. It is also a time to revel in one's freedom, and showcase cultural practices that were denied to them while in captivity. Many enslaved peoples are stripped of their cultural practices and rights in an effort to demoralize them. This can mean the outlawing of their dances, songs, arts, and even important ceremonies for marriage or child-naming. Thus, celebrations of freedom from slavery may place importance on these nearly-lost parts of one's culture. Some ceremonies may even take on new facets from the ways that they were practiced in secret, such as \"walking around a large tree and greeting one another on the other side\" becoming an important wedding tradition.": "庆祝摆脱奴隶制和压迫的自由，往往是庄严的纪念和欢快的庆祝。人们缅怀为自由而战的领导人和抵抗者，同时也哀悼那些在看到自己的人民获得自由之前就死去的人。这也是一个为自己的自由而陶醉的时刻，并展示他们在被囚禁期间被剥夺的文化习俗。许多被奴役的人民被剥夺了他们的文化习俗和权利，以努力使他们丧失士气。这可能意味着他们的舞蹈、歌曲、艺术，甚至重要的婚姻或儿童命名仪式被取缔。因此，摆脱奴隶制的庆祝活动可能会重视一个人的文化中这些几乎消失的部分。一些仪式甚至可能从秘密进行的方式中获得新的面貌，例如 \"绕着一棵大树走，在另一边相互问候 \"成为重要的婚礼传统。",
	"When designing a holiday to celebrate freedom from slavery or oppression, remember to think of it from various viewpoints. Why were the formerly-enslaved people singled out (racial or religious differences, defeated in a previous war, etc)? How are the formerly-enslaved peoples treated by their former oppressors? Are formerly-enslaved people still oppressed from an economic standpoint? Do they have true equality, or are they still looked down upon by other groups? Do the former oppressors feel as though they are now the injured or unfairly-treated party in this situation? Also keep in mind that no large group holds all of the same opinions as one another; some descendants of slave-owners may feel remorseful for the actions of their ancestors, while others may prefer to carry on a tradition of hatred.": "在设计一个庆祝摆脱奴隶制或压迫的节日时，记得要从不同的角度来考虑它。为什么以前的被奴役者会被挑出来（种族或宗教差异，在以前的战争中被打败，等等）？以前被奴役的人民是如何被他们以前的压迫者对待的？从经济角度看，以前的被奴役者是否仍然受到压迫？他们是否有真正的平等，还是仍然被其他群体看不起？在这种情况下，以前的压迫者是否觉得他们现在是受害方或受到不公平待遇的一方？还要记住，没有一个大的群体彼此持有所有相同的观点；一些奴隶主的后代可能对他们祖先的行为感到悔恨，而另一些人可能更愿意继承仇恨的传统。",

	"This holiday is a mixture of Easter celebrations, the idiom of the Golden Goose, and a particular Japanese fairytale! It also utilizes the Swanmay, a classic AD&D race of humanoid women who can transform into birds. Though at the time of this publication the Swanmay have not appeared in D&D since 3.5e, some intrepid writers on the DM's Guild have brought the race into the light of 5th edition. Legend has it that a poor and lonely hunter once found an injured swan at the side of a frozen lake, surrounded by wolves. Running off the wolves, the hunter saved the swan, and brought her to his home where he mended her broken wing and took care of her throughout the winter. Once the swan healed, she flew away in the spring. At the start of the next winter, the hunter was visited by a beautiful woman travelling through the woods near his home. The two fell in love and married. Though the hunter and his bride were happy together, they were very poor. Feeling guilty that he could not provide for his lovely wife, the hunter became depressed. One day, the hunter's wife came out of their chicken coop and handed him a golden egg she'd found, encouraging him to hurry to the nearby town and sell it. The hunter did, and he brought back a sack of money and enough food for them to feast on for days. Time passed, and when the money ran out, the hunter's wife found another golden egg for him to sell. When spring came, the hunter asked his wife which of their chickens was providing golden eggs, but she merely told him not to worry about it, and not to go into the chicken coop when she was tending to the birds. Though the hunter begrudgingly agreed, his curiosity got the better of him one day. When his wife went into the chicken coop, he peered through a crack in the wooden wall. To his shock, he watched his wife transform into a swan, and lay a golden egg. The hunter cried out in surprise, and startled the swan.": "这个节日是复活节庆祝活动、金鹅的成语和一个特殊的日本童话的混合体！它还利用了天鹅美，这个经典的AD&D种族可以变成鸟类。它还利用了天鹅美，一个经典的AD&D种族，即可以变身为鸟类的人形女性。尽管在本书出版时，天鹅绒还没有出现在D&D的3.5e版本中，但DM's Guild的一些无畏的作者已经将这个种族带到了第五版中。传说中，一个贫穷而孤独的猎人曾经在一个冰湖边发现了一只受伤的天鹅，周围都是狼。猎人赶走了狼群，救下了天鹅，并把她带到了自己的家里，在那里他修补了她受伤的翅膀，并照顾了她整个冬天。一旦天鹅痊愈，她就在春天飞走了。第二年冬天开始时，一位在他家附近的森林里旅行的美丽女子拜访了猎人。两人相爱并结婚。虽然猎人和他的新娘在一起很幸福，但他们却非常贫穷。猎人因为不能供养他可爱的妻子而感到内疚，变得很沮丧。有一天，猎人的妻子从他们的鸡舍里出来，递给他一个她发现的金蛋，鼓励他赶紧去附近的镇上卖掉它。猎人照做了，他带回了一袋钱和足够他们吃上好几天的食物。时间一天天过去，钱用完了，猎人的妻子又找到一个金蛋让他去卖。当春天来临的时候，猎人问他的妻子是哪只鸡在提供金蛋，但她只是告诉他不要担心，当她照看小鸡的时候不要进入鸡舍。虽然猎人勉强同意了，但有一天他的好奇心还是得到了满足。当他的妻子进入鸡舍时，他从木墙的缝隙中窥视。令他震惊的是，他看到妻子变成了一只天鹅，并下了一个金蛋。猎人惊讶地叫了起来，吓了天鹅一跳。",
	"The hunter's wife emerged from the chicken coop, sobbing. She admitted to him that she was the swan he had saved the previous winter, and was Princess of the Swanmay. But, now that he knew her secret, she could no longer stay with him. Though her husband tearfully begged for forgiveness, the heartbroken princess turned back into a swan and flew away. Though the tale of love lost and trust broken is an important fable, many folk latch onto more superficial aspects of the story. Every spring, celebrants of the Day Of The Golden Swan go into woods to search for golden (or jeweled) eggs left by theoretical Swanmay royalty. As the story (and possibility of finding treasure) is so enthralling to young children, the holiday is built around entertaining them. Fresh eggs are carefully emptied by poking a small hole in both ends and blowing out the contents. The emptied shells are then decorated in any number of ways. Many households dye them by boiling them with vegetables or berries, and some paint designs on them, or paste pieces of paper to the outside. Adults will hide decorated eggs in the woods near their homes, and then send children out (under watchful supervision) to try to find the hidden eggs. Because the empty egg shells are quite fragile, children are encouraged not to be rambunctious in their hunt. Small prizes or treats are often awarded to the children who find the most (intact) eggs, or who find eggs that were especially cleverly hidden.": "猎人的妻子从鸡笼里走出来，泣不成声。她向他承认，她就是他前年冬天救下的那只天鹅，是天鹅梅的公主。但是，现在他知道了她的秘密，她不能再和他在一起了。尽管她的丈夫含泪乞求原谅，这位伤心的公主还是变回了天鹅，飞走了。尽管这个关于失去爱情和信任的故事是一个重要的寓言，但许多民间人士却抓住了故事中更多肤浅的方面。每年春天，金天鹅节的庆祝者都会到树林里寻找理论上天鹅美皇室成员留下的金蛋（或珠宝蛋）。由于这个故事（以及找到宝藏的可能性）对年幼的孩子来说是如此吸引人，这个节日是围绕着娱乐他们而建立的。新鲜的鸡蛋被小心翼翼地掏出来，在两端戳一个小洞，然后把里面的东西吹出来。清空后的蛋壳可以用任何方式进行装饰。许多家庭用蔬菜或浆果煮鸡蛋来染色，有些家庭在鸡蛋上画图案，或在外面贴上纸片。大人们会把装饰好的鸡蛋藏在他们家附近的树林里，然后让孩子们出去（在有人监督的情况下），试图找到隐藏的鸡蛋。由于空蛋壳相当脆弱，因此鼓励孩子们在寻找过程中不要太过狂躁。找到最多（完整的）鸡蛋的孩子，或者找到隐藏得特别巧妙的鸡蛋的孩子，通常会得到小奖品或点心。",

Thus, pastel colors like powder pink, baby blue, mint, lavender, and periwinkle are commonly associated with the holiday, but brighter colors may also be painted directly on the eggs": "大多数常见的染料在蛋壳上附着力很差，所以许多鸡蛋都是粉色的。因此，粉红色、婴儿蓝、薄荷色、薰衣草色和长春花色等柔和的颜色通常与这个节日有关，但更鲜艳的颜色也可以直接画在鸡蛋上。",

It is based on the pagan holiday of Beltane, practiced in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle Of Man.": "这个节日在以牛为重要主食的农村地区效果最好，不过你也可以修改一下，把重点放在任何可能被赶到夏季牧场的动物上。这个节日的许多方面也很适合异族参与。这个节日通常在西方日历的5月1日举行，或者大致在春分和夏至之间。它基于异教节日Beltane，在爱尔兰、苏格兰和马恩岛实行。",
	"At the start of summer, cattle owners will drive their cattle to new pastures. This is often a major undertaking, and in order to protect their herd from illness and misfortune, they will reach out to nearby druid circles to ask for blessings. Understanding the destructive, but also renewing properties of fire, a druid circle pioneered this night-time festival to cleanse a farm house of ill omens and start the summer season fresh. Over time, the festival grew beyond just farmers and their cattle, and now entire towns take part in the celebration.": "在夏季开始时，牛主人会把他们的牛赶到新的牧场。这通常是一项重要的工作，为了保护他们的牛群不受疾病和不幸的影响，他们会向附近的德鲁伊圈子求助，请求祝福。由于了解火的破坏性，但也有更新的特性，一个德鲁伊圈率先在夜间举行这个节日，以清洗农舍的不祥之兆，并开始新的夏季。随着时间的推移，这个节日逐渐超越了农民和他们的牛，现在整个城镇都参加了这个庆祝活动。",
	"The day of the Bonfire Bash, children and young women will wake early in the morning to go and pick flowers like marigolds, hazel, hawthorn, and primrose. These yellow flowers, thought to symbolize fire, will be woven into garlands or gathered into bouquets, and will be used to decorate houses, cattle, and equipment used in churning butter.": "篝火晚会那天，儿童和年轻妇女会在清晨醒来，去采摘金盏花、榛子、山楂和报春花等鲜花。这些被认为象征着火的黄花将被编织成花环或收集成花束，并被用来装饰房屋、牛和用于搅动黄油的设备。",
	"Though fae are mysterious creatures and little is known about them by most common folk, superstitions run rampant. One such superstition is that fairies are especially active around the start of summer. Thus, locals will also make visits to locations where fairies are known or suspected to inhabit, to make offerings like milk, berries, flowers, and naturebased treasures like sea shells, uncut jewels, and wooden beads. Because fairies are known for their mischievousness, townsfolk and farmers hope to appease (or at least distract) the fairies during their bonfire rituals.": "虽然异族是神秘的生物，大多数普通人对他们知之甚少，但迷信却很猖獗。其中一个迷信是，仙女在夏天开始的时候特别活跃。因此，当地人也会到已知或怀疑有仙女居住的地方去，献上牛奶、浆果、鲜花以及海贝、未切割的珠宝和木珠等基于自然的宝物。由于仙女以其顽皮著称，乡民和农民希望在篝火仪式上安抚（或至少分散）仙女的注意力。",
	"At sun down, every household fire in the town is put out. Even blacksmiths may be willing to put their work on hold to baffle down their forges. Meanwhile, druids or other local spiritual figures construct two large bonfires out in an open field. Under the guidance of the druids and spiritual leaders, cattle are driven between the two flames, believing that the fires will chase away any ills attached to them.": "太阳落山时，镇上每家每户的火都被扑灭。甚至铁匠们也可能愿意把他们的工作搁置起来，把他们的锻炉关掉。同时，德鲁伊或其他当地精神人物在空地上建造两个大篝火。在德鲁伊和精神领袖的指导下，牛被赶到这两堆火之间，相信火会赶走与它们有关的任何病痛。",
	"While every town practices it differently, common celebrations include drinking, dancing, sacrificing animals, and/or cooking communal meals on smaller bonfires lit from the two large fires. Jumping over fire pits is also a common activity, practiced by young men or women to show their bravery, or by lovers to show their devotion to one another (\"leaping through fire to be together\"). Once the festivities have ended, every member of the town takes a torch and lights it at one of the two giant bonfires of the festival. This flame is then used to re-light the fires in their homes, warming their hearths with a fresh and pure light. The next day, the ashes from the bonfire are collected and scattered on crops.": "虽然每个城镇的做法不同，但常见的庆祝活动包括饮酒、跳舞、祭祀动物和/或在两个大火点燃的小篝火上做公共餐。跳过火坑也是一项常见的活动，由年轻男子或妇女进行，以显示他们的勇敢，或由恋人进行，以显示他们对彼此的奉献（\"跳过火坑，在一起\"）。庆典结束后，镇上的每个人都拿着火把，在节日的两个巨大篝火中的一个点燃。然后，这束火焰被用来重新点燃他们家中的火，用新鲜和纯净的光线温暖他们的炉灶。第二天，篝火的灰烬被收集起来，撒在农作物上。",
	"Yellow flowers are the primary decor of the Bonfire Bash, but yellow clothing is also very popular among those with the complexion to pull it off. Aside from bouquets and garlands of yellow flowers, the Bonfire Bash has very little in the way of decor. Fire itself is an important symbol, but is utilized as a tool more so than displayed as decoration.": "黄花是篝火晚会的主要装饰，但黄色的衣服在那些有肤色的人中也非常流行。除了黄花的花束和花环，篝火晚会上的装饰很少。火本身是一个重要的象征，但更多地是作为一种工具来使用，而不是作为装饰来展示。",
	"An oatmeal cake called the \"Bonfire Bannock\" is cooked on griddles over small bonfires, shared by townsfolk, and also offered to the cattle. Roasted lamb is the traditional dinner at many Bonfire Bashes. Of course, drinking is also very common, but given the proximity to fire and the need to tend to herds of cattle the next day, most people try to keep it from getting out of hand.": "一种被称为 \"篝火班诺克 \"的燕麦饼在小篝火上用烤炉烤制，由乡亲们分享，也提供给牛群。烤羊肉是许多篝火晚会的传统晚餐。当然，喝酒也很常见，但考虑到离火很近，而且第二天需要照顾成群的牛，大多数人都尽量不让它失控。",
	"The crux of this festival is location and season. The ideal locale is a village or town located at the base of a mountain. By keeping the settlement small, it reduces the wealth and access to magical options, meaning the locals have to resort to more mundane means of keeping cool. The core of the festival is inspired by a summer practice of Japanese nobles in the Heian Period.": "这个节日的关键是地点和季节。理想的地点是位于山脚下的村庄或城镇。通过保持定居点的规模，它减少了财富和获得魔法的机会，这意味着当地人不得不采用更多的世俗手段来保持凉爽。这个节日的核心灵感来自平安时代日本贵族的夏季习俗。",
	"Not every holiday begins with a fairytale or superstition. Sometimes, a holiday forms purely out of an observation of the seasons, or in reaction to a worldly change. The Summer Breeze Festival is not widely celebrated, but it is a vital community activity for some villages in the dead of summer. In order to beat the sweltering summer heat, this small farming town prepares a week in advance of the Summer Breeze Festival by sending groups of farm hands up into the nearby mountain. For three days straight, the groups of four to eight young men and women depart in the morning, carrying empty chests on litters. The groups travel for days up to a specially built \"pantry\" high up in the side of the mountain to retrieve large blocks of ice, packing them into their lined chests, before descending the mountain again.": "并非每个节日都是以童话或迷信开始的。有时，一个节日的形成纯粹是出于对季节的观察，或对世俗变化的反应。夏风节没有得到广泛的庆祝，但它是一些村庄在夏日里的一项重要社区活动。为了抵御炎热的夏季，这个小农镇在夏风节前一周就开始准备，把一批批农夫送到附近的山上。连续三天，这些由四至八名青年男女组成的小组在早晨出发，用轿子抬着空箱子。这群人连续几天到山边高处专门建造的 \"储藏室 \"去取大块的冰，把它们装进有衬里的箱子，然后再下山。",
	"For the three days of the festival itself, the groups arrive to great fanfare, bringing half-melted ice blocks to the grateful residents. The remaining ice is shaved by workers and served in bowls, drizzled with sweet syrups made from locally grown fruits. Though the ice doesn't last long, and the hot weather will continue for weeks to come, the festival is a welcome break for laborers at the hottest point in the summer.": "在节日的三天里，这些团体大张旗鼓地来到这里，把半融化的冰块带给感激的居民。剩下的冰块由工人刨开，装在碗里，淋上用当地种植的水果制成的甜味糖浆。尽管冰块不会持续很久，而且炎热的天气将持续数周，但在夏季最热的时候，这个节日对劳动者来说是一个受欢迎的休息。",
	"Streamers made of strips of cloth are hung from the eaves of buildings, sometimes tied to bells or chimes, in order to flutter and chime whenever a breeze blows through. In poorer homes, these cloth strips are made of whatever can be repurposed, such as clothing that has been damaged and recycled into rags. In wealthier homes, strips of white and blue linen or silk are preferred.": "由布条制成的彩旗被挂在建筑物的屋檐下，有时绑在铃铛或风铃上，以便每当有微风吹过时，彩旗就会飘动并发出响声。在较贫穷的家庭，这些布条是用任何可以重新利用的东西制成的，如被损坏的衣服，回收成破布。在较富裕的家庭，首选白色和蓝色亚麻布或丝绸的布条。",
	"While shaved ice is the most classic staple of the festival, a variety of fresh fruits are also consumed, usually having been lightly chilled in a nearby river immediately before sale.": "虽然刨冰是节日中最经典的主食，但各种新鲜水果也被消费，通常在销售前会在附近的河流中轻度冰冻。",
	"The influences on this holiday may be as obvious as they are numerous, drawing inspiration from Halloween, Samhain, Dia de Muertos, Bon Odori, and many others. Depending on the mythos related to death and the afterlife in your particular setting, you may have to fiddle with some of the details, but the door is wide open for the potential of having actual ghostly involvement in the holiday.": "这个节日的影响可能是显而易见的，因为它从万圣节、Samhain、Dia de Muertos、Bon Odori和其他许多地方汲取了灵感。根据你的特定环境中与死亡和来世有关的神话，你可能不得不对一些细节进行调整，但大门是敞开的，有可能让鬼魂参与到这个节日中。",
	"Legend has it that long ago, two men fought each other in a joust, for the affections of the woman they loved. One of the men died when he was thrown from his injured horse and broke his neck, and the winner went on to marry the lady they had both adored. Many years later, the now retired jouster was walking home late at night when he saw a rider on horseback on a hill. The rider was silhouetted before the moon, but he could see that the rider's own head was but the skull of a horse, and his eyes glowed like candles.": "传说在很久以前，有两个人为了争夺他们所爱的女人的感情，在一场比武中互相争斗。其中一个人被从受伤的马背上摔下来摔断了脖子而死，而胜利者则娶了他们共同爱慕的女士。许多年后，这位已经退休的骑手在深夜回家的路上，看到一个骑手骑在山上。骑手在月亮前的剪影，但他可以看到骑手自己的头只是一个马的头骨，他的眼睛像蜡烛一样发光。",
	"Terrified, the man realized he was being haunted by the opponent he had jousted with many years earlier, and he ran home to his wife. Finding his wife at her dressing table, the husband tried to explain in a panic that she needed to hide him. Not knowing what else to do, the woman took one of her dresses and threw it on her husband, before hiding his head with one of her veils. Moments later, the doors burst open with a terrifying screech of a nightmare horse. Husband and wife alike both screamed and cowered. However, not recognizing his rival in disguise, the undead rider left to continue his search elsewhere. They say that every year, even centuries after his rival has died, the undead rider returns to the world of the living in search of revenge. Each time the undead rider crosses over into the world of the living, he brings with him many souls who long to see loved ones they miss, or who crave resolution to unfinished business. Even if these ghosts mean no ill will, their mere presence is a danger to mortals, so living mortals have started a tradition of disguising themselves on the night of Soultide so that those seeking them can't find them.": "这名男子吓坏了，意识到他被多年前与他比武的对手缠住了，于是他跑回家找他的妻子。发现他的妻子在她的梳妆台前，丈夫惊慌地试图解释她需要隐藏他。由于不知道还能做什么，这个女人拿起她的一件衣服扔到她丈夫身上，然后用她的一件面纱遮住他的头。几分钟后，大门突然打开，发出噩梦般的可怕尖叫声。丈夫和妻子都尖叫起来，畏缩不前。然而，由于没有认出他伪装的对手，这个不死的骑手离开了，继续在其他地方寻找。他们说，每年，甚至在他的对手死后的几个世纪，不死骑士都会回到活人的世界，寻找复仇的机会。每次亡灵骑士穿越到活人世界，他都会带来许多灵魂，他们渴望看到他们所想念的亲人，或者渴望解决未完成的事情。即使这些鬼魂没有恶意，他们的存在对凡人来说也是一种危险，所以活着的凡人已经开始了一个传统，即在Soultide之夜伪装自己，以便那些寻找他们的人无法找到他们。",
	"As the sun goes down on Soultide, anyone brave enough to go outside does so wearing a costume. Originally, crossdressing was the norm, but more creative costumes have come into popularity, such as mummers, adventurers, a variety of masks, or even dressing as ghosts themselves. Nobles began to throw costume parties where they'd gather with friends to eat, have drinks, and tell horror stories; this tradition would eventually make its way to common households as well.": "当太阳在Soultide下山时，任何有胆量到外面去的人都会穿上服装。最初，变装是常态，但更有创意的服装已经开始流行，例如莫默尔人、冒险家、各种面具，甚至自己装扮成鬼。贵族们开始举办化装舞会，他们会和朋友们聚在一起吃饭、喝酒、讲恐怖故事；这一传统最终也会进入普通家庭。",
	"The safety of costumes and the likelihood for many houses to be empty at night, gave way to the tradition of children playing tricks on adults, ranging from minor vandalism to boobytrapped doors and gates. Children began knocking on doors to make certain a home owner was not present before pulling their prank, and if any adult were to answer, the disguised children would demand a small ransom, otherwise they'd pull a trick on the household. Feigning a great fright, many adults acquiesced to the demand, and would give children small pastries, treats, or a few copper coins. This tradition became known as \"trick or treat\".": "服装的安全性和许多房子在晚上可能是空的，这让孩子们对成年人进行恶作剧的传统成为可能，从轻微的破坏行为到诱杀门和门的陷阱。孩子们开始敲门，以确定屋主不在，然后再进行恶作剧，如果有成人应答，伪装的孩子们就会索要小额赎金，否则他们就会对这家人进行恶作剧。许多成年人假装非常害怕，默许了这个要求，并会给孩子们小糕点、点心或几个铜币。这一传统被称为 \"不给钱就捣蛋\"。",
	"At midnight, celebrants travel to the nearest body of water (a river, lake, pond, etc), bringing candles and small wooden boats with paper coverings. Removing their masks and disguises by the edge of the water, they light the candles and set the paper lanterns afloat on the water. This act is intended to provide the wandering ghosts of their loved ones with a light to lead them home to the realm of the dead, lest they be trapped in the mortal world for the rest of the year.": "午夜时分，庆祝者前往最近的水体（河流、湖泊、池塘等），带上蜡烛和带纸罩的小木船。在水边摘下面具和伪装，他们点燃蜡烛，将纸灯笼漂浮在水面上。这一行为是为了给他们所爱的人的游魂提供一盏灯，引导他们回家，回到亡灵的领域，以免他们在一年的剩余时间里被困在凡间。",
	"Traditional decorative colors of Soultide include orange, black, purple, and vivid pink. A number of decorative traditions have spawned surrounding Soultide, but they may vary between locales. Recalling the tale of the undead rider who's head was a horse's skull, some houses decorate their doorways or their fireplace mantles with fake humanoid skulls, believing the undead rider will be driven away in jealousy. These skulls, often made of clay or wood, are sometimes painted or decorated with ribbons and flowers to lighten the macabre aesthetic. In households that cannot afford such frivolous decor, it is common for pumpkins or other gourds to be carved with faces, and used in place of skulls.": "Soultide的传统装饰颜色包括橙色、黑色、紫色和鲜艳的粉红色。围绕着Soultide产生了一些装饰传统，但它们在不同的地方可能有所不同。回顾不死骑士的故事，他的头是一个马的头骨，一些房子用假的人形头骨装饰他们的门口或壁炉罩，相信不死骑士会因为嫉妒而被赶走。这些头骨通常由粘土或木头制成，有时被涂上油漆或用丝带和鲜花装饰，以减轻可怕的美感。在买不起这种轻浮装饰的家庭中，常见的是在南瓜或其他葫芦上刻上脸，用来代替头骨。",
	"Though there is not a particular type of food that is traditionally served for Soultide dinner, many households prepare a variety of small treats that can be handed out to ward off mischievous children. This can be as simple as apples or pears, but some households bake small pastries or hand out bags of roasted nuts and seeds.": "虽然在传统上没有一种特定的食物被用于灵魂节晚餐，但许多家庭准备了各种小点心，可以分发出去，以抵御调皮的孩子。这可以是简单的苹果或梨，但有些家庭会烘烤小糕点或分发烤坚果和种子的袋子。",
	"A village of half-orcs live in a mountainous region. They tell tales that long ago, a village of humans had settled at the base of their mountain, but they were being preyed upon by bandits and thieves. As the harvest season was coming to an end, the human village feared that they would not have enough supplies to make it through the winter. Little did they know, a tribe of orcs in the mountains above were suffering an equally lean hunting season.": "一个半兽人的村庄生活在一个山区。他们讲述了这样一个故事：很久以前，一个人类村落在他们的山脚下定居，但他们被强盗和小偷所掠夺。由于收获季节即将结束，这个人类村庄担心他们没有足够的物资来度过冬天。他们不知道，山上的兽人部落正遭受着同样不景气的狩猎季节。",
	"One day, the orcs mounted a raid on the human village, not knowing that they were already besieged by a band of thieves. The orcs frightened the thieves, allowing the villagers to fight back and run the band out of town. The orcs were impressed by the uncharacteristic bravery of the human farmers, and when the humans offered what was left of their harvest to the orcs out of gratitude (or perhaps begging them not to slaughter them too), the orcs were surprised to see how many crops the humans had cultivated in the rocky terrain. Though orcs generally believed other races to be beneath them, the tribe also knew that they were unlikely to survive the coming winter in their current state.": "有一天，兽人袭击了人类的村庄，却不知道他们已经被一伙盗贼围困了。兽人惊吓了盗贼，使村民们得以反击，并将盗贼团赶出了小镇。兽人对人类农民一反常态的勇敢印象深刻，当人类出于感激将他们剩下的收获献给兽人时（也许是求他们不要把他们也宰了），兽人惊讶地看到人类在岩石地带种植了这么多作物。虽然兽人普遍认为其他种族的地位在他们之下，但部落也知道，以他们目前的状态，不太可能在即将到来的冬天生存。",
	"The orcish tribal leader, and the mayor of the small farming town, struck a temporary agreement to share in their resources for the winter. In addition, humans taught orcs their methods of raising livestock and growing crops in the rocky terrain, and orcs in turn taught humans new hunting techniques. By the time spring came, the two groups had formed a tightly knit joint-community.The modern half-orc village still has a few venerable old human men and women who remember what it was like to have orcish neighbors when they were small children, but since orcs seldom live past the age of 45, the orcish traditions are upheld entirely by their half-orc descendants. Every year at the end of the harvest season, they hold a communal feast in the town hall, celebrating the gathering of people together what the locals call, somewhat unimaginatively, Gathering Day.": "兽人部落的首领和小农镇的镇长达成了一项临时协议，分享他们的资源过冬。此外，人类向兽人传授了他们在岩石地带饲养牲畜和种植作物的方法，而兽人也向人类传授了新的狩猎技术。现代的半兽人村庄仍有一些可敬的人类老人，他们还记得小时候有兽人邻居的感觉，但由于兽人很少活过45岁，兽人的传统完全由他们的半兽人后代来维护。每年收获季节结束时，他们都会在市政厅举行公共宴会，庆祝人们聚集在一起，当地人称之为 \"聚会日\"，有点匪夷所思。",
	"The day is celebrated with farming contests to see who's cultivated the largest produce or raised the best livestock, as well as archery contests and hunting competitions. Shortly before dinner a customary \"bandit attack\" is carried out by some of the village's teenagers and young adults, who are run off by \"the bravest\" children of the village. In their community, the transition from a child who runs off the bandits, to playing one of the bandits, is considered a marker of when a boy or girl becomes a young man or woman, and coincides with additional privileges and responsibilities they'll take on in the coming seasons.": "这一天的庆祝活动包括农事比赛，看谁种植的农产品最大或饲养的牲畜最好，以及射箭比赛和打猎比赛。晚饭前不久，村里的一些青少年和年轻人按惯例进行 \"土匪袭击\"，由村里 \"最勇敢的 \"孩子把他们赶走。在他们的社区里，从跑掉土匪的孩子到扮演土匪之一，被认为是一个男孩或女孩成为年轻男人或女人的标志，并与他们在未来的季节里将承担的额外特权和责任相吻合。",
	"Though decor is not considered of chief importance to the holiday, it's not uncommon for baskets or crates of produce to be put on display, or for dried meats to be hung up like garlands, evoking a sense of plentifulness.": "虽然装饰并不被认为是节日的主要重点，但把一篮子或一箱子的农产品摆出来，或把干肉像花环一样挂起来，唤起人们对丰收的感觉，也是很常见的。",
	"Though much of the food from the harvest will be treated and preserved to last through the winter, the communal feast attempts to serve a wide variety of dishes. Every household provides some part, and many hold an informal competition to bring the best pies, pickles, roasted vegetables, and roasted meats at the feast.": "虽然大部分收获的食物会被处理和保存，以持续到冬季，但公共宴会试图提供各种各样的菜肴。每家每户都提供一些部分，许多家庭举行非正式的比赛，以便在宴会上带来最好的馅饼、腌制食品、烤蔬菜和烤肉。",
	"At first glance, many westerners will recognize this holiday as being analogous to Christmas, but in truth, it's actually patterned after Yuletide. Though the Feast Of The Wild Hunt not associated with any specific religious figures in this iteration, you're welcome to make modifications to bring it closer to the base of Christmas or Yuletide if you prefer. If you're using a calendar that is analogous to the western calendar, the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will begin on the 20th day of the 12th month, and end on the 31st, meaning it will coincide with any potential New Year's Eve celebrations. An \"either-or\" approach is recommended, as stacking holidays or placing a New Year's Day holiday immediately after this 12day feast will be excessive and/or exhausting.": "乍一看，许多西方人会认为这个节日类似于圣诞节，但事实上，它实际上是以圣诞为模式。虽然在这个版本中，狂猎节与任何特定的宗教人物都没有关系，但如果你愿意，欢迎你进行修改，使其更接近圣诞节或余暇节的基础。如果你使用的是与西方日历相似的日历，狂猎节将从12月20日开始，在31日结束，这意味着它将与任何可能的除夕庆祝活动相吻合。建议采用 \"非此即彼 \"的方法，因为在这12天的盛宴之后立即叠加假期或安排元旦假期将是过度的和/或疲惫的。",
	"This twelve-day festival begins on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and celebrates the tradition that a party of ghostly (or perhaps divine) hunters rides through the woods in search of great prey during this season. It is believed that this \"wild hunt\" also sweeps up all of the remnants of dead souls of the year and brings them along as servants on the hunt, ending times of mourning. The wild hunt serves an important purpose, bringing a close to the end of the year and starting anew.": "这个为期12天的节日始于冬至，即一年中最短的一天，并庆祝这样一个传统：在这个季节，一队幽灵般的（或许是神圣的）猎人骑马穿过森林，寻找伟大的猎物。人们相信，这个 \"野猎 \"也会扫除一年中所有死去的灵魂的残余，并把它们作为猎物的仆人带在身边，结束哀悼的时间。野外狩猎有一个重要的目的，为一年的结束和新的开始画上句号。",
	"It is customary that no work is done during the twelve day festival; while this does not mean that every business closes (healers, inns, and general stores often stay open in at least a limited capacity), people hurry to get many jobs finished before the festival, such as cutting wood, works of crafting, sewing, etc. Some believe that disaster awaits those who have not completed their work before the festival, and they may even be swept up along with the dead souls and taken by the wild hunt. The Feast Of The Wild Hunt makes for a busy travelling season, as celebrants will often try to return to their family home to celebrate. Though arriving by sunset on the first day of the festival is ideal, work obligations and heavily snowed-in roads make this a difficult proposition for many. As such, visitors tend to trickle in during all twelve days of the feast. Some households who don't have extended family or aren't expecting guests will open their doors to travellers during the season, providing shelter for those who haven't yet completed their journeys. Though all twelve days are considered part of the holiday, four days in particular have noteworthy customs.": "按照惯例，在十二天的节日里不做任何工作；虽然这并不意味着每家企业都关门（医士、旅馆和普通商店往往至少在有限的范围内保持营业），但人们赶在节日前完成许多工作，如砍柴、手工制作、缝纫等。有些人认为，灾难正等待着那些在节日前没有完成工作的人，他们甚至可能与死去的灵魂一起被卷走，被野猎带走。荒野狩猎节是一个繁忙的旅行季节，因为庆祝者往往会设法回到他们的家来庆祝。虽然在节日的第一天日落前到达是最理想的，但工作的义务和严重积雪的道路使许多人难以做到这一点。因此，游客往往会在节日的所有12天内陆续到来。一些没有大家庭或不期待客人的家庭会在这个季节向旅行者敞开大门，为那些尚未完成旅行的人提供住所。虽然所有12天都被认为是节日的一部分，但有四天特别有值得注意的习俗。",
	"The wild hunt begins, and everyone completes their work by sunset, with no intent to resume until the festival has ended. On this day, it is customary for households to gift their friends and loved ones with logs for their hearths, to keep them burning for all twelve days of the festival. Very large and dry logs are prized gifts, and may be kept and prepared for months before the Feast Of The Wild Hunt. Many people will also keep bundles of small dry sticks and twigs tied with cord (often gathered by the household's children) to give as gifts to acquaintances. Roadside vendors will sell bundles of split firewood decorated with ribbons, holly, mistletoe, and pine needles to be purchased for gifting when travellers return home as guests. This is considered a time for welcoming guests, and households will often bake fresh bread or keep pots of spiced cider over their fires, letting the welcoming scents of the season waft out to draw their travellers home.": "野外狩猎开始了，每个人都在日落前完成他们的工作，在节日结束前没有人打算继续工作。在这一天，家家户户都习惯于给朋友和亲人的壁炉送上原木，让他们在节日的所有12天里一直燃烧。非常大和干燥的原木是珍贵的礼物，可以在野猎节前保存和准备几个月。许多人还会保留一捆用绳索捆绑的小干树枝和树枝（通常是由家庭的孩子收集），作为礼物送给熟人。路边的小贩会出售一捆捆用丝带、冬青、槲寄生和松针装饰的劈开的木柴，当旅行者作为客人回家时，可以买来送人。这被认为是一个欢迎客人的时刻，家庭往往会烘烤新鲜的面包或在火堆上放上一壶香料苹果酒，让这个季节的欢迎气味飘散出来，吸引他们的旅客回家。",
	"The last night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt, and on this night, the wild hunt takes with them the dead old year itself, allowing a new year to be ushered in. The last of the food and drink from the feasting is to be finished off, and it's considered bad luck to leave any leftovers. Any oaths made on this night are considered of the utmost importance, and for this reason, many people will propose marriage during this last night of celebration. Many oaths of love, friendship, brotherhood and sisterhood, devotion, or protection are made on the last night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt, and everyone endeavours to enter into the new year with a clean conscience and a bright outlook on the future.": "狂猎节的最后一晚，在这个夜晚，狂猎带着死去的旧年本身，让新的一年迎来了。宴席上最后的食物和饮料都要吃完，留下任何残羹剩饭都被认为是坏运气。在这个夜晚作出的任何誓言都被认为是最重要的，为此，许多人将在这最后一个庆祝之夜提出结婚。许多关于爱情、友谊、兄弟姐妹情谊、奉献或保护的誓言都是在狂欢节的最后一夜作出的，每个人都努力以干净的良心和对未来的美好展望进入新的一年。",
	"The twelfth night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt is considered the last night of the year, therefore, functions as New Year's Eve. Locales that celebrate the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will usually not celebrate an additional New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.": "狂猎节的第十二个晚上被认为是一年中的最后一个晚上，因此，作为除夕的功能。庆祝狂猎节的地区通常不会再庆祝除夕或元旦。",
	"Natural plants like oak wood, pine needles and pine cones, holly, and mistletoe are considered emblematic of the season, and snow is a natural occurrence. As such, the traditional colors of the feast are brown, green, red, and white, and many will incorporate these colors into their household linens, clothes, etc. Candles are often made of red or green wax for use during the holiday season": "橡树木、松针和松果、冬青和槲寄生等天然植物被认为是这个季节的象征，而雪是一种自然现象。因此，宴席的传统颜色是棕色、绿色、红色和白色，许多人会将这些颜色融入他们的家纺、衣服等。蜡烛通常由红色或绿色的蜡制成，在节日期间使用。",
	"Feasting is considered a major part of the holiday. The most traditional foods are wild boar, goose, and goat. Drinking is also considered a popular part of the celebration, and spiced hot cider is a tradition found far and wide. Nearly every household has their own family recipe for spiced cider. This is a time of year when many special treats are made, that would normally be considered too extravagant to serve on a normal basis. Pastries, cakes, pies, and other sweets are common treats of the season.": "宴会被认为是节日的一个主要部分。最传统的食物是野猪肉、鹅肉和山羊。饮酒也被认为是庆祝活动的一个受欢迎的部分，五香热苹果酒是一个广泛存在的传统。几乎每家每户都有自己的五香苹果酒配方。每年的这个时候都会有许多特殊的食物被制作出来，这些食物通常被认为是太奢侈了，无法在正常情况下供应。糕点、蛋糕、馅饼和其他甜食是这个季节常见的食物。",

I will repeatedly remind and encourage you to be as imaginative as possible throughout this supplement, and provide short examples which I hope inspire you to create fantastical tavern games for you and your players! Of course, I encourage Dungeon Masters to adapt these games in order to make them more appropriate for your game and your players.": "我的玩家对在当地酒馆里玩游戏有一种永不满足的欲望。这本小补编是在他们享受分布在我们整个战役中的酒馆里的各种技巧游戏的过程中诞生的。这些游戏有些是我生活中流行的游戏的幻想改编，有些是我个人对听说过或读过的酒馆游戏的理解。这些构成了我在活动中实施的最受欢迎和最成功的游戏，我希望你和你的玩家喜欢它们。请记住，这些游戏的成功完全取决于你和你的玩家对事件的叙述能力--不要害怕增加悬念，或者描述遭遇的细节 我将反复提醒并鼓励你在本补编中尽可能地发挥想象力，并提供一些简短的例子，我希望这些例子能够激励你为你和你的玩家创造出幻想中的酒馆游戏 当然，我鼓励地下城主改编这些游戏，以便使它们更适合你的游戏和你的玩家。",
	"A burly dragonborn, sweat on his brow, is locked fist-in-fist with a grinning halfling clad in various furs. The bar is loud with cheers and clinking glasses as the two are stuck in a stalemate. Their eyes narrowed at one another over their trembling clenched fists. Suddenly, the halfling lets loose a barbaric shout and slams the fist of the dragonborn onto the scarred wooden table. A chorus of cheers go up behind the halfling and she winks at the astonished dragonborn before waltzing to the bar.": "一个魁梧的龙裔，额头上的汗水，正与一个身穿各种皮草的半身人拳脚相加。当两人陷入僵局时，酒吧里响起了欢呼声和碰杯声。他们的眼睛在颤抖的拳头上互相眯着。突然，半身人发出一声野蛮的叫喊，将龙裔的拳头砸在有疤痕的木桌上。半身人身后响起了一片欢呼声，她向惊愕的龙裔眨了眨眼，然后向酒吧走去。",
	"Arm wrestling is a classic, two-person contest of strength! If the player is competing against an NPC, be sure to describe the opponent. Is it a goblin trapper with a humorously large left bicep? Is it a burly human guard? Or maybe a seemingly wimpy elf who turns out to be a barbarian that rages during the contest? Be creative!": "掰手腕是一种经典的、两人的力量较量! 如果玩家的对手是NPC，一定要描述对手。是一个有着幽默的大左二头肌的地精捕手？是一个粗壮的人类警卫吗？或者是一个看似懦弱的精灵，结果是一个在比赛中暴怒的野蛮人？请发挥你的创造力!",
	"The two contestants undergo a contest of strength by making a series of opposing Strength checks from an even starting position.

	"Let's examine these mechanics from the above example of Layla the halfling and Reynard the dragonborn. They roll a opposing strength checks from a starting position. Layla rolls a 12 and Reynard rolls a 15, so Reynard is able to muster the will to push Layla's arm into the next position. However, on the next check, Layla rolls a Natural 20 against Reynard's 16! Layla hunkers down and, with a burst of strength, is able to push Reynard back to the starting position- and then down to the next position on the opposite side. On the next throw, Reyard rolls a 12 against Layla's 10, and now the two are once more evenly matched in the center. At this point, Layla enters her Barbarian Rage, conferring advantage on her Strength checks, and allowing her to beat Reynard in the next two checks, pushing Reynard into the second position. Here Reynard flubs yet another Strength check and proceeds to make a Strength saving throw, where he rolls an 11. Unfortunately for him, Layla is a beefy halfling with a Strength score of 14, meaning that he fails his saving throw and Layla is able to slam Reynard's fist to the table amid a chorus of cheers!": "让我们从上述半身人莱拉和龙裔雷纳德的例子中来研究这些机制。他们在开始的位置上掷出一个对立的力量检查。莱拉掷出12分，雷纳德掷出15分，所以雷纳德能够鼓起意志将莱拉的手臂推到下一个位置。然而，在下一次检查中，莱拉掷出了自然20分，而雷纳德掷出了16分！莱拉蜷缩着身子，并将手伸向了雷纳德。莱拉蜷缩着身体，用一股力量将雷纳德推回到起始位置--然后再推到对面的下一个位置。在下一次投掷中，雷纳德掷出了12，而雷拉掷出了10，现在两人又一次在中间势均力敌。这时，莱拉进入了她的野蛮人之怒，赋予她力量检查的优势，并允许她在接下来的两次检查中击败雷纳德，将雷纳德推到第二位。在这里，雷纳德又一次搞砸了力量检查，并继续进行力量储蓄，他掷出了11分。不幸的是，莱拉是个强壮的半身人，力量值为14，这意味着他的蓄力失败，莱拉能够在一片欢呼声中把雷纳德的拳头摔到桌子上。",
	"It is possible for these contests to go on for some time. If an arm wrestling competition goes on for six checks (or you see the players begin to lose interest), have any contestants who are not proficient in arm wrestling make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of the opponent's Strength score. If a contestant fails, they gain disadvantage for the remainder of the contest. Any NPC who the DM deems to be an experienced arm wrestler may have profiency in arm wrestling, and a player may gain proficiency in arm wrestling by winning 10 arm wrestling matches within a week!": "这些比赛有可能会持续一段时间。如果掰手腕的比赛持续了六次（或者你看到选手们开始失去兴趣），让任何不精通掰手腕的选手用对手的力量值的DC来进行宪法拯救。如果参赛者失败了，他们在比赛的剩余时间里就会处于劣势。任何被DM认为是有经验的摔跤手的NPC都可以拥有摔跤的能力，而玩家在一周内赢得10场摔跤比赛，就可以获得摔跤的熟练度。",
	"This is a simple gambling game that involves the racing of squirrels, or any other creature of the DM's choosing. Be sure to describe the clientele in the room and the animals themselves!

If multiple players choose the same squirrel, have them alternate who makes the check.": "每位玩家选择一只松鼠并下注，赌注要符合或超过最低赌注。这个最低赌注将根据游戏地点的不同而不同! 有钱人可以从10金开始，而更多的普通人可以从2铜开始。然后每个玩家掷一个D20，看他们选择的松鼠在每一轮中向前走多少英寸。如果多个玩家选择同一只松鼠，让他们轮流做检查。",

	"One way you could spice up a tavern or a game of squirrel racing is by having the bookie \"forget\" the bets made by the players and try to cheat them out of their full winnings, or try to run with the players money.

	" This is a 2-4 player gambling game that is based on a simple game of darts. Again, be sure to describe the contestants and the clientele.

	"An iconic moment in fantasy fiction is the grand tournament. From the archery contests of Robin Hood to the jousts of Ivanhoe, it seems like half the stories about the Middle Ages have the heroes attend such a festival somewhere along the line. Whether honoring the king's birthday, the birth of a saint, the nation's victory over its enemies, or just because it's Midsummer's Day, festive pavilions are raised and flags and pennants flap in the rising breeze to signal that it is time for the main event to begin! However, even in the real-world tournaments were about far more than bows and lances, and in a fantasy game the options for what would constitute a friendly (or even not-so-friendly) competition are infinitely varied, from gritty and brutal feats of raw strength to magical marvels of the highest fantasy. That is what Royal Tournaments is all about. It provides a fantastic resource for incorporating tournaments and festivals into your campaign, including an array of different tournament events and awards, some physical, some magical, some social, and all delightful. Whether your players want to promote the interests of their own kingdom or simply fight for glory and prizes, Royal Tournaments has everything you need to make the tournaments in your campaign magnificent and memorable. Legendary Games was founded on the principle of delivering first-class product for your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game experience, brought to you by the very authors who design and contribute to the adventures, hardbacks, and campaign supplements you are already using. The Legendary Games tradition is to combine rich story and background, innovative layout, beautiful aesthetics, and excellence in design that is second to none. This product is the latest in that tradition, and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it. Game on!": "奇幻小说中的一个标志性时刻是大比武。从罗宾汉的射箭比赛到伊凡诺的比武，似乎一半的中世纪故事都有英雄们在某处参加这样一个节日。无论是纪念国王的生日、圣人的诞生、国家对敌人的胜利，还是仅仅因为是仲夏节，节日的亭子都会升起，旗帜和旗帜在升起的微风中飘扬，以示主要活动开始的时间! 然而，即使在现实世界中，锦标赛的内容也远远超过了弓箭和长矛，而在一个幻想游戏中，构成友好（甚至不友好）竞争的选项是无限多样的，从原始力量的粗暴和残酷的壮举到最高幻想的魔法奇迹。这就是《皇家锦标赛》的全部内容。它为将锦标赛和节日纳入你的活动提供了一个奇妙的资源，包括一系列不同的锦标赛活动和奖项，有些是物理的，有些是魔法的，有些是社会的，而且都是令人愉快的。无论你的玩家是想促进自己王国的利益，还是仅仅为了荣誉和奖品而战，《皇家锦标赛》都有你所需要的一切，使你的战役中的锦标赛宏伟而令人难忘。传奇游戏公司成立的原则是为您的开拓者角色扮演游戏体验提供一流的产品，这些产品由设计您已经在使用的冒险、精装书和战役补充材料并为之作出贡献的作者带来。传奇游戏的传统是将丰富的故事和背景、创新的布局、美丽的美学和卓越的设计结合起来，这是首屈一指的。本产品是这一传统的最新成果，我们希望你能像我们制作它一样喜欢使用它。游戏开始!",
	"While player characters are used to living lives of high adventure with chances for glorious victory or potentially fatal failure lurking around every corner, they may sometimes lose sight of the fact that most people in the world they inhabit are not so lucky. True, the common folk perhaps have a different kind of luck, one which involves far less risk of death on a daily basis, but there is still something terribly romantic and exciting about being able to at least play at the kind of dramatics and heroics they hear about in the stories. That is where Royal Tournaments come in! Every now and then, it is time for a festival, and while competitions and mock battles often play a large part they are hardly the only element to entice the common folk. Festivals can be held for many purposes, and these are no different in a fantasy world than they are in the real world.": "虽然玩家角色习惯于过着高度冒险的生活，每个角落都潜伏着辉煌的胜利或潜在的致命失败的机会，但他们有时可能会忽略一个事实，即他们居住的世界中的大多数人都没有这么幸运。诚然，普通人也许有一种不同的运气，一种每天涉及的死亡风险要小得多的运气，但能够至少发挥他们在故事中听到的那种戏剧性和英雄主义，仍然有一些可怕的浪漫和兴奋。这就是皇家锦标赛的意义所在 每隔一段时间，就会有一个节日，虽然比赛和模拟战斗经常发挥很大的作用，但它们并不是吸引普通民众的唯一因素。举行节日的目的有很多，这些在幻想世界中与现实世界中没有什么不同。",
	"Festivals can generally be divided into two categories: civic and religious. Civic festivals may commemorate the founding of a nation or a city, or the birth of a great leader or hero, or the overthrow of a hated tyrant. Celebrations may mark the day of a mighty battle, mixing celebration of victory with a solemn memorial of those lost in the struggle, or the consummation of peace after a long period of strife. Civic festivals may celebrate the life of a particular person of great renown, or they may be aimed at the entire populace. Likewise, they may be local to a single city or locality, or they may be widespread across an entire continent.": "节日一般可分为两类：公民性节日和宗教性节日。民间节日可能是为了纪念一个国家或城市的建立，或伟大领袖或英雄的诞生，或推翻一个可恨的暴君。庆祝活动可能标志着一场强大的战斗的日子，将庆祝胜利与庄严纪念那些在斗争中丧生的人结合起来，或在长期的冲突后完成和平。公民节日可能会庆祝某个著名人物的生命，也可能是针对全体人民的。同样，它们可能是一个城市或地区的地方性节日，也可能是整个大陆的普遍性节日。",
	"Religious festivals may occur independently of any corresponding civic events. In some societies, the regular worship rituals of religion may be a weekly or daily occurrence, or even multiple times per day as the faithful are called to prayer by cathedral bells or the echoing calls of the priesthood. Other religions may have less structured worship routines, but nearly all commemorate the birth or death of saints or religious leaders in much the same way civic festivals celebrate secular leaders. Religious festivals, however, may also focus upon dates fixed by the dogma of the church for events beyond mortal ken, when their divine patron stepped foot upon the earth or first appeared to its acolytes in the spirit or in the flesh. Divine incarnations, interventions, apotheosis, sacrifice, resurrection, and more may be marked by the adherents of the faith with a celebration large or small.": "宗教节日可能独立于任何相应的公民活动而发生。在一些社会中，宗教的定期礼拜仪式可能每周或每天都会举行，甚至每天都会举行多次，因为信徒们会被大教堂的钟声或神职人员的呼唤声所召唤去祈祷。其他宗教可能没有那么多结构化的礼拜程序，但几乎所有的宗教都会纪念圣人或宗教领袖的出生或死亡，其方式与公民节日庆祝世俗领袖的方式基本相同。然而，宗教节日也可能集中在教会教条所规定的凡人无法理解的事件的日期，即他们神圣的守护者踏上地球或首次以精神或肉体出现在其信徒面前的日期。神圣的化身、干预、神化、牺牲、复活等等都可能被信仰的信徒们用大大小小的庆祝活动来标记。",
	"There are, of course, festive occasions that may fall into either category, especially those that are tied to the seasons. Such natural markers on the calendar often gain religious significance or may be considered sacred to many faiths. Special prayers may be offered up for the planting in the spring or the harvest in the fall, while Midsummer's may be a time for worshipful offerings or blessed marriages amid summer's bounty even as Midwinter's sees vigils throughout the long dark. This is particularly true in areas where druidical faiths predominate, but the religious associations with the seasons (if any) may vary a great deal from region to region and culture to culture. In areas where no one faith is dominant, cultural attachments around seasonal holidays may be far more important to the citizenry than any particular religious celebration. A diverse city or region may see multiple overlapping holidays celebrated in many ways among the different cultures and faiths present in the area.": "当然，有一些节日可能属于这两类，特别是那些与季节有关的节日。日历上的这种自然标记往往具有宗教意义，或者可能被许多信仰认为是神圣的。仲夏节可能是为春天的播种或秋天的收获而进行的特别祈祷，而仲夏节可能是在夏天的丰收中进行崇拜的供品或祝福的婚姻的时候，即使仲冬节是在漫长的黑暗中守夜的时候。这在德鲁伊信仰占主导地位的地区尤其如此，但与季节有关的宗教联系（如果有的话）可能因地区和文化的不同而有很大的差异。在没有一种信仰占主导地位的地区，对公民来说，围绕季节性节日的文化联系可能比任何特定的宗教庆祝活动重要得多。一个多元化的城市或地区可能会看到多个重叠的节日在该地区不同的文化和信仰中以多种方式庆祝。",
	"Even apart from the seasons, important events may be conflated and commemorated by coincidence, just because they happen to occur on or around a known local event or existing holiday. St. Crispin's Day, a minor holiday whose lineage is somewhat unclear, nonetheless was immortalized by Shakespeare's recounting of the Battle of Agincourt in Henry V. The possibly apocryphal saints still lend their name to the 25th of October, and for that matter to the rousing \"St. Crispin's Day speech\" that Shakespeare wrote nearly 200 years after the battle, but the memory of the day has evolved to be more a celebration of the band of brotherhood between warriors.": "甚至除了季节之外，重要的事件也可能因为巧合而被混在一起纪念，只是因为它们恰好发生在一个已知的地方事件或现有的节日上或周围。圣克里斯平日是一个小节日，其来源有些不清楚，但莎士比亚在《亨利五世》中对阿金库尔战役的叙述使其不朽。可能是天书的圣人仍然把他们的名字借给10月25日，为此，莎士比亚在战役发生近200年后写下了激动人心的 \"圣克里斯平日演讲\"，但对这一天的记忆已经演变为对战士之间兄弟关系的庆祝。",
	"In roleplaying terms, the nature of the festival is not critically important, other than to provide an overall theme and to help determine what manner of ancillary events, such as tournaments or contests, might be most appropriate. If you are using the Festival Edict rules in Ultimate Rulership (5E) from Legendary Games, civic and religious festivals provide different types of bonuses to your kingdom based on the buildings available in the city where the festival takes place.": "在角色扮演方面，节日的性质并不十分重要，只是为了提供一个整体的主题，并帮助确定什么方式的辅助活动，如锦标赛或竞赛，可能是最合适的。如果你使用的是传奇游戏公司的《终极统治》（5E）中的节日诏书规则，公民和宗教节日会根据节日所在城市的可用建筑为你的王国提供不同类型的奖励。",
	"Festivals are typically held in and around a city, town, or village. However, during a festival, settlements are typically thronged with people, so unless the festival is a failure (see the Festival Edict rules in {@book Ultimate Rulership|UltRule}, reprinted in the Appendix of this book) you should treat the settlement as one size larger than its actual size for all purposes.": "节日通常是在城市、城镇或村庄及其周围举行。然而，在节日期间，居民点通常都是人山人海，所以除非节日是失败的（见本书附录中重印的{@book Ultimate Rulership|UltRule}中的节日诏书规则），否则你应该将居民点视为比其实际大小大一号的地方。",
	"In some cases, festivals may be held outside of any settlement, often near a Landmark (see Special Terrain the Kingdom-building rules in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games). In this case, the number of attendees at the festival can be highly variable, depending on how significant the festival, how often other festivals are held, the season of the year, and how far travelers typically come to attend.": "在某些情况下，节日可能会在任何定居点之外举行，通常是在地标附近（见传奇游戏公司《王国》（5E）中的《特殊地形》王国建设规则）。在这种情况下，参加节日的人数可能会有很大变化，这取决于节日的重要性、其他节日的举办频率、一年中的季节以及旅行者通常会到多远的地方去参加。",
	"Because of the high concentration of merchants and wealthy visitors (as well as black marketeers), the gp limit for buying and selling should be treated as a large city for the duration of the festival.": "由于商人和富有的游客（以及黑市商人）的高度集中，在节日期间，买卖的gp限制应被视为一个大型城市。",
	"The thronging crowds present at a typical festival do not interfere with the ability of PCs to move around the festival, but if tactical movement and line of sight are important (as during a combat encounter), there is a 50% chance that when an encounter begins at a festival the PCs will be in the midst of a crowd 20 to 80 feet in diameter. Crowds provide cover, allow Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and are considered difficult terrain for movement purposes. A DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check or DC 15 Charisma (Intimidate) check allows a PC to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction (up to 30 feet per round), as long as the PC can be seen or heard.": "在一个典型的节日里，拥挤的人群并不影响NPC在节日里的移动能力，但是如果战术移动和视线很重要的话（如在战斗中），有50%的机会，当在节日里开始遭遇时，NPC将处于直径20到80英尺的人群之中。人群提供了掩护，允许进行灵巧（隐身）检查，并被认为是移动的困难地形。通过DC12魅力（说服）检查或DC15魅力（恐吓）检查，可以说服人群向一个特定的方向移动（每轮最多30英尺），只要可以看到或听到PC。",
	"Finding a particular location in the festival grounds is a simple task to locate lesser-known merchants and locations. No roll should be necessary, especially if what is being sought is something available to the common folk. Finding information on specific people at the festival can be accomplished through Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather information, or at the GM's option with Wisdom (Insight) checks to learn about common folk and Intelligence (History) to learn about the rich and powerful. The DC should be relatively low, but feel free to use this as an opportunity to disclose information that may feed into the adventure.": "在节日的场地上寻找一个特定的位置是一个简单的任务，可以找到不太知名的商人和地点。不需要掷骰子，特别是如果所寻找的是普通人可以得到的东西。在节日中寻找特定人物的信息可以通过智力（调查）检查来收集信息，或者由GM选择用智慧（洞察力）检查来了解普通人，用智力（历史）来了解富人和权贵。测验的难度应该相对较低，但可以利用这个机会来披露可能会影响到冒险的信息。",
	"For the common folk simply attending a festival is a reward in and of itself, and low-level player characters can approach a festival the same way, as tourists and gawkers at the spectacle of it all. As PCs advance in level, however, they should see festivals as an opportunity to spread their fame across the land. They can do this by earning honor by showing mercy and gentility alongside prowess and might, gaining reputation and fame by drawing attention to themselves and their exploits, recruiting contacts and cultivating relationships, or even running a business or building up an organization.": "对于普通人来说，参加节日本身就是一种奖励，低级别的玩家角色可以以同样的方式接近节日，作为游客和目不转睛地看着这一切的景象。然而，随着NPC等级的提高，他们应该把节日看作是一个在全国范围内传播自己名声的机会。他们可以通过以下方式来实现这一目标：通过在展示能力和力量的同时表现出仁慈和温文尔雅来赢得荣誉，通过吸引人们对自己和自己的功绩的注意来获得声誉和名声，招募联系人和培养关系，甚至经营生意或建立一个组织。",
	"A tournament can serve as entertainment and an opportunity to engage in some contests and trials less dangerous than the normal adventuring life, but it also offers a great opportunity for adventurers to make an impact in the campaign world. This is doubly true if one or more of the PCs is ruling a kingdom, especially a new domain just trying to establish itself. They can put their newborn kingdom into the public eye amongst the notables and the commons alike from surrounding lands, earning prestige simply by being present for a major event. Of course, the more effort they put into promoting themselves the more prestige they can earn for themselves and their land, which will enhance their legitimacy, inducing other rulers to acknowledge them as equals and fellow rulers rather than up-jumped nobodies waiting to be picked off by their betters. This advancement in their fame and esteem is called Renown.": "锦标赛可以作为娱乐和参与一些竞赛和试炼的机会，其危险性比正常的冒险生活要小，但它也为冒险者提供了一个在活动世界中产生影响的好机会。如果一个或多个NPC正在统治一个王国，特别是一个刚刚试图建立自己的新领域，那就更是如此了。他们可以把他们的新生王国带入公众的视野，在周围土地上的名人和平民之间，仅仅通过出席一个重大事件就可以赢得声望。当然，他们越是努力宣传自己，就能为自己和自己的土地赢得更多的声望，这将提高他们的合法性，促使其他统治者承认他们是平等的、同僚的统治者，而不是等待被他们的上级挑走的无名小卒。这种对他们的名声和尊重的提升被称为 \"声誉\"。",
	"{@b Starting Renown}: PCs can take a variety of actions that earn Renown, but their baseline Renown is equal to 5 before any further adjustments.": "{@b Starting Renown}: 个人可以采取各种行动来获得荣誉，但在进一步调整之前，他们的基准荣誉等于5。",
	"{@b Keeping Up Appearances}: Whether PCs visit a festival, they may simply walk the grounds like the common folk or they may reserve a patch of the grounds for themselves and their accommodations. Even if they do not intend to stay at the festival overnight, putting up a structure displaying their ensign or flag is seen by others at the festival as a mark of their legitimacy. As a result, Renown is modified by their choice of quarters. PCs using magic to create their lodgings still must pay half of the above cost for the right to host their structure on the festival grounds. PCs may emulate a pavilion or grand pavilion with {@spell mirage arcana|phb} or similar magic, but each day they do this there is a cumulative 7% chance that they are discovered. Once the illusion is discovered, word gets around of the PCs' pretensions to glory and their Renown is reduced by 2.": "{@b Keeping Up Appearances}: 无论NPC是否参观节日，他们都可以像普通人一样在场地上行走，或者为自己和自己的住宿保留一块场地。即使他们不打算在节日里过夜，在节日里竖起一个展示他们的旗帜的建筑物也会被其他人视为他们合法身份的标志。因此，他们的名声会因为他们选择的住所而有所改变。使用魔法来创造他们的住所的NPC仍然必须支付上述费用的一半，以获得在节日场地上建造他们的建筑的权利。PC可以用（1%）或类似的魔法来模仿一个亭子或大亭子，但是每一天他们这样做都有累计7%的机会被发现。一旦幻觉被发现，NPC对荣耀的假装就会被传开，他们的声望会减少2。",
	"{@b Beggar's Hill} (free) PCs stand among the rabble, peeking over fences, hanging from trees, or otherwise watching from the fringes of the venue.": "{@b Beggar's Hill} (免费) PC站在乌合之众中，从栅栏上偷看，挂在树上，或以其他方式从会场的边缘观察。",
	"{@b Absence} (free) PCs may choose to simply not attend the events hosted at the arena, which may be deemed an affront to their hosts. All PCs need not attend all events, but they should send at least one representative to attend.": "{@b Absence}（免费）NPC可以选择干脆不参加竞技场举办的活动，这可能被认为是对主人的侮辱。所有的NPC不需要参加所有的活动，但他们应该至少派一名代表参加。",
	"{@b Stands} (2 gp per PC per day) PCs have a bench seat inside the arena, but far back from the action.": "{@b Stands} (每个人每天2金币) 个人在竞技场内有一个长椅，但离行动很远。",
	"{@b Box Seats} (50 gp per day) PCs have a reserved seat up front for up to 6 people, with refreshments brought to them.": "{@b Box Seats} (50 gp/day) PC在前面有一个最多可以容纳6人的预留座位，并有茶点送到他们面前。",
	"{@b Royal Box} (500 gp per day) PCs have padded seats and lavish canopies to keep off the sun or rain (often blocking the view of commoners behind them), with elaborate refreshments for up to a dozen people in a box adjacent to that of the hosts.": "{@b Royal Box} (500 gp/day) PC有软垫座椅和豪华的雨棚来遮挡阳光或雨水（经常挡住后面平民的视线），在与主人的包厢相邻的地方有精心准备的茶点，最多能容纳十几个人。",
	"{@b Commons} (free) PCs wander the festival or stay amongst the smallfolk, talking to people as they can and vying for attention with performers and hawkers.": "{@b Commons} (免费) PC在节日里闲逛，或呆在小市民中间，尽可能地与人交谈，与表演者和小贩争夺注意力。",
	"{@b Tent} (10 gp per day) PCs have a small tent or lodge for conducting private meetings or a single secure shelter.": "{@b Tent} (每天10金币) 个人有一个小帐篷或小屋，用于进行私人会议，或一个单一的安全住所。",
	"{@b Pavilion} (100 gp per day) PCs have a large tent sufficient to host a formal meeting, with table, chairs, and other furniture, or multiple secure shelters, with a corral and grooms to keep their mounts close at hand.": "{@b Pavilion} (每天100金币) 个人拥有一个足以举办正式会议的大帐篷，有桌子、椅子和其他家具，或多个安全的庇护所，有一个畜栏和马夫，使他们的坐骑近在咫尺。",
	"{@b Grand Pavilion} (1,000 gp per day) PCs have an opulent structure, which can be raised with a rod of splendor or daily use of mage's magnificent mansion. Mounts are kept in a separate adjacent structure staffed with multiple grooms.": "{@b Grand Pavilion} (1,000 gp/day) 个人拥有一个富丽堂皇的结构，可以用辉煌之棒或日常使用法师的宏伟豪宅来提升它。坐骑被饲养在邻近的独立结构中，配备有多个马夫。",
	"{@b King of the Hill}: A festival may have a particular spot reserved for celebrations, often a small hill or rise on the edge of the festival grounds, ringed in trees, for picnics and parties by day and revels by night by those wealthy folks who lack the title or privilege to claim an established pavilion. They can nonetheless attract the acclaim of errants and lesser noble scions and other untitled yet affluent folk by winning a lottery to host the celebrations for a night, wearing a crown as the King of Fools, a Crown of Holly, or a similar award. A chance in the lottery depends on the size of the festival, but is typically 1d10 x 10 gp. PCs who bid may roll a d20; on a natural 20, they win the crown and may invite any they wish to attend, but must provide music, food, and drink to all. They may provide entertainment themselves (or may hire a bard or other performer) and must provide 1d10 x 100 gp worth of food and drink, but they gain 1 point of Renown (see below) each time they win the honor.": "{@b King of the Hill}: 一个节日可能会有一个特定的庆祝地点，通常是在节日场地边缘的一个小山丘或高地，环抱着树木，供那些缺乏头衔或特权的富人在白天野餐和聚会，在晚上狂欢，以获得既定的亭子。然而，他们可以通过抽签赢得一个晚上的庆祝活动，戴上愚人王、冬青王冠或类似的奖励，来吸引移民和较小的贵族子弟以及其他无权无势的富人的赞誉。抽签的机会取决于庆典的规模，但通常是1d10 x 10 gp。参加竞标的人可以掷出一个D20；如果自然数为20，他们就赢得了王冠，并可以邀请任何他们想参加的人，但必须为所有人提供音乐、食物和饮料。他们可以自己提供娱乐（也可以雇佣吟游诗人或其他表演者），并且必须提供价值1d10 x 100 gp的食物和饮料，但他们每次赢得荣誉都会获得1点名望（见下文）。",
	"{@b Noble Boxes}: If the festival grounds have an arena for tests of skill and strength, such as jousting lists, archery ranges, racetracks, or more exotic competitions, PCs can build their repute by purchasing the rights to the best seats, nearest to the action and to the hosts of the tournament, rather than sitting with the rabble.": "{@b Noble Boxes}: 如果节日的场地上有一个测试技能和力量的竞技场，比如比武大会、射箭场、赛马场，或者更多的异国比赛，NPC可以通过购买最好的座位的权利来建立自己的声誉，这些座位离行动和比赛的主持人最近，而不是和乌合之众坐在一起。",
	"{@b Making a Name and Spreading Your Fame}: In addition to simply establishing their presence with a pavilion or box seats for the grand events of the tournament, PCs can make an active effort at building the reputation of their domain. They can do this by personally entering and succeeding in contests and tournaments or hiring champions to do so on their behalf or by using their own skills and abilities. Each of the following methods requires a day of effort by one or more party members (cohorts may participate, and PCs able to make alliance with a noble patron with bards at his beck and call may be able to access their skills as well). Each effort requires the use of more than one skill; if one PC attempts to fulfill multiple skill requirements, all of their skill checks have disadvantage due to dividing their attention and efforts. If PCs succeed on all of the required skills (DC 12 each), they gain one point of Renown. If they fail one or more skill checks, they gain nothing, but if they fail all skill checks for a method by 5 or more, they lose 1 point of Renown. Each of these methods can be used more than once by repeating the effort on a subsequent day, but the DC increases by 2 each time a method is repeated.": "{@b Making a Name and Spreading Your Fame}: 除了简单地在锦标赛的盛大活动中建立自己的存在，NPC还可以积极努力地建立自己领域的声誉。他们可以通过亲自参加比赛和锦标赛并获得成功，或者雇佣冠军代表他们参加，或者利用自己的技能和能力来做到这一点。以下每种方法都需要一名或多名党员付出一天的努力（同党可以参加，而能够与有吟游诗人的贵族赞助人结盟的NPC也可以获得他们的技能）。每项努力都需要使用一个以上的技能；如果一个PC试图满足多个技能要求，他们所有的技能检查都会因为分散注意力和努力而处于劣势。如果PC在所有要求的技能上都成功了（每个技能的DC为12），他们会获得1点荣誉。如果他们有一个或多个技能检查失败，他们就没有任何收获，但如果他们对一种方法的所有技能检查都失败5次或以上，他们就会失去1点Renown。这些方法中的每一种都可以在以后的日子里通过重复努力而多次使用，但每次重复使用时，DC增加2。",
	"Success at one of these efforts can be awarded experience points as an encounter with a CR 2 lower than the party's average level.": "在这些努力中的一个成功，可以作为一个CR值比党的平均水平低2的遭遇而获得经验值。",
	"A festival has all manner of common entertainments, minstrels, mummers, singers, jugglers, tumblers, trained animals, and on and on, but much of its allure is in the glory of competition. One factor to consider in preparing to run a festival or tournament is the level of magic available in the world. In a campaign where magic is rare and mysterious like that of Tolkien, simple fortune telling and fireworks are a marvelous spectacle that the folk at the festival may remember for years to come. In a typical fantasy campaign, however, magic is far more commonplace. Even small villages may well have a hedge mage or two capable of working real magic, or a cleric, or druid tending the local shrine. Even a 1st-level sorcerer or wizard can put on an impressive display of stage magic with spells like {@spell dancing lights}, {@spell flare}, {@spell ghost sound}, and {@spell prestidigitation}, and can go well beyond that with low-level illusions like {@spell minor image} and {@spell major image}.": "一个节日有各种常见的娱乐活动，吟游诗人、哑巴、歌手、杂耍者、翻跟头者、训练有素的动物，等等，但它的大部分诱惑力在于竞争的荣耀。在准备举办节日或锦标赛时要考虑的一个因素是世界上可用的魔法的水平。在像托尔金那样魔法稀少而神秘的战役中，简单的算命和烟花是一种奇妙的景象，参加节日的人们可能会在以后的日子里记住它。然而，在一个典型的幻想活动中，魔法要普遍得多。即使是小村庄，也很可能有一两个能够施展真正魔法的树篱法师，或一个牧师，或照料当地神殿的德鲁伊。即使是一级巫师或魔法师，也可以用{@spell dancing lights}、{@spell flare}、{@spell ghost sound}和{@spell prestidigitation}这样的法术来展示令人印象深刻的舞台魔法，还可以用{@spell minor image}和{@spell major image}这样的低级幻术来超越它。",
	"In addition to basic showmanship, the level of magic that exists in the campaign world on an everyday basis affects the kinds of events you include. A simple footrace in a low-magic campaign could become an exercise in super-speed or even a teleportation contest in a campaign saturated with magic power, horses replaced with pegasi and bowshots replaced with hurled lightning or psychic duels. The tone and feel of the campaign, as well as the level of the PCs, are important to consider when deciding what kinds of contests to incorporate into a festival.": "除了基本的表演技巧外，战役世界中日常存在的魔法水平也会影响到你所包括的事件种类。在一个低魔法水平的战役中，一场简单的赛跑可能会变成一场超级速度的练习，甚至在一个充满魔法力量的战役中变成一场传送比赛，马被替换成小马，弓箭被替换成投掷的闪电或精神决斗。在决定将哪种比赛纳入节日时，活动的基调和感觉，以及PC的水平，都是需要考虑的。",
	"Whatever the style of contests you employ in your festival, including having different festivals each with their own focus, they are most enjoyable for players if their characters take part, and certainly other nobles in nearby lands may encourage them to enter, or even early in their careers to ride on that leader's behalf as her or his champions. PCs not directly involved in the contest still might enjoy watching the proceedings or making wagers on them, and you may also allow players to take the role of one of the NPC contestants (perhaps 'sponsoring' them or hiring them to compete in the name of their own land). Contestants can always yield in a contest if they wish, but such public surrender results in a loss of 1 point of Renown (see below), while winning a contest usually nets 1 point of Renown; if a contest has two different victory conditions and the same contestant wins both, that contestant wins 3 points of Renown. In addition, competing in such contests, while not generally dangerous in the same way as adventuring, still should be worth and appropriate xp award, typically as an encounter containing monsters that are roughly of a challenge rating of 1-3 levels below the PCs' own level.": "无论你在节日中采用什么样的竞赛方式，包括有不同的节日，每个节日都有自己的重点，如果玩家的角色参加了这些竞赛，他们就会感到非常愉快，当然，附近土地上的其他贵族可能会鼓励他们参加，甚至在他们职业生涯的早期，作为她或他的冠军，代表该领袖骑马。没有直接参与比赛的NPC仍然可能喜欢观看比赛过程或为他们下赌注，你也可以允许玩家扮演NPC参赛者之一的角色（也许是 \"赞助 \"他们或雇用他们以自己土地的名义参赛）。如果参赛者愿意，他们总是可以在比赛中屈服，但这种公开投降的结果是损失1点声望（见下文），而赢得比赛通常会得到1点声望；如果一场比赛有两个不同的胜利条件，而同一个参赛者赢得了两个，那么这个参赛者会赢得3点声望。此外，参加这样的比赛，虽然一般来说不像冒险那样危险，但仍然应该值得并获得适当的经验奖励，通常是遭遇怪物，这些怪物的挑战等级大约比NPC自己的等级低1-3级。",

	"It is not just the events themselves where magic is relevant, however. Whatever the basic magic level of the world and the tournament, player characters themselves certainly have access to magic, and so too do significant NPCs, even if the rank and file competitors and spectators do not. Since magic does exist in the game world, it is entirely plausible that some competitors will seek to use magic (or other extraordinary means) to cheat, either on their own behalf or to bias the results of events in favor of one competitor versus another. Bearing in mind that festivals and tournaments are sponsored by the wealthy, this could mean that some sponsors might use such chicanery and skullduggery to favor their own champions in the contests, but it also means that the patrons of the event have the means and wherewithal to enlist magical sentries and to have warding effects in place to prevent cheating. Of course, such supernatural sentries may not be wholly trustworthy, as they are not necessarily obliged to enforce the rules honestly and fairly equally across the board. Corrupt contest marshals might look the other way when certain competitors come to the list.": "然而，与魔法有关的不仅仅是赛事本身。无论世界和比赛的基本魔法水平如何，玩家角色本身肯定可以使用魔法，重要的NPC也是如此，即使普通的竞争对手和观众没有。由于魔法确实存在于游戏世界中，一些竞争者试图使用魔法（或其他特殊手段）来作弊是完全合理的，无论是为他们自己还是为偏袒某个竞争者的活动结果。考虑到节日和锦标赛是由富人赞助的，这可能意味着一些赞助商可能会利用这种欺骗和诡计在比赛中偏袒他们自己的冠军，但这也意味着活动的赞助人有办法和资金来招募魔法哨兵，并有防护效果来防止作弊。当然，这种超自然的哨兵可能并不完全值得信赖，因为他们不一定有义务诚实和公平地全面执行规则。当某些竞争者出现在名单上时，腐败的比赛指挥员可能会睁一只眼闭一只眼。",
	"The attitudes towards cheating can be determined entirely at the GM's discretion, of course, but they also can be determined by the characteristics of the area where the festival is being held. Specifically, areas with high levels of Corruption and Crime (see the Settlement rules in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games) are likely to be tolerant of cheating, while those with high levels of Law will take a dim view of such shenanigans. However, cultural, racial, and even religious attitudes may play a role in determining the level of dishonesty likely to be encountered.": "当然，对作弊的态度可以完全由GM来决定，但也可以由举办节日的地区的特点来决定。具体来说，腐败和犯罪程度高的地区（见传奇游戏公司的王国（5E）中的定居规则）可能会容忍作弊，而法律程度高的地区会对这种诡计不屑一顾。然而，文化、种族、甚至宗教态度都可能在决定可能遇到的不诚实的程度上起作用。",
	"The capabilities of monitoring the competition depend on the resources of the hosts. Small local festivals may operate on the honor system out of necessity, but a festival sponsored by a king might have marshals (either in ostentatious uniforms, hidden amongst the crowd, or both) using spells like detect thoughts to check for evidence of cheating. Even in areas known for skullduggery, a host making a great show of striving for a clean competition might require competitors to use the equipment provided by the host, including clothing as well as arms and armor, to avoid them smuggling contraband items into the competition. Of course, Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used to smuggle small items in despite such surveillance.": "监督比赛的能力取决于主办方的资源。小规模的地方节日可能出于需要而采用荣誉制度，但由国王赞助的节日可能会有元帅（要么穿着浮夸的制服，要么隐藏在人群中，或者两者都有）使用侦查思想等法术来检查作弊的证据。即使是在以诡计多端著称的地区，主办方也可能要求参赛者使用主办方提供的装备，包括服装以及武器和盔甲，以避免他们将违禁品偷运到比赛中。当然，灵巧（Sleight of Hand）检查可以用来在这种监视下偷运小物品。",
	"While combat-focused may seem more glamorous, virtually anything can be a competition. One need look no further than county and state fairs to see the vestiges of agricultural and crafting competitions in the modern day, to say nothing of competitive cooking shows and the like on television.

Such food or drink might have a pungent and horrifying aroma or an overwhelmingly bitter flavor, or the food might simply look revolting and repellent. Most popularly, an iron stomach contest involves either extremely strong liquor that brings on near-immediate intoxication or exceptionally spicy food—whether pickled, fermented, or even fresh off the vine—that brings a nigh-unendurable heat that leaves competitors flushed, weeping, and gasping for breath. An eating or drinking contest also can feature fairly ordinary food and beverages in a race to see which contestant can gorge themselves, for example, on the most pies or sausages or can guzzle the most mead or milk in a set amount of time. To add an element of fun (or humiliation), contestants might have to eat or drink with their hands tied behind their backs or with some other handicap.": "几乎所有的文化都有奇怪的美食，这些美食考验着勇于尝试的人的决心和耐力。这种食物或饮料可能有刺鼻的可怕的香味或令人难以忍受的苦味，或者食物可能只是看起来令人反感和厌恶。最流行的是，铁胃比赛涉及到极其强烈的酒，使人几乎立即中毒，或者特别辣的食物--无论是腌制的、发酵的，甚至是新鲜的葡萄--带来难以忍受的热量，使竞争者面红耳赤、流泪、喘不过气来。吃饭或喝酒比赛也可以以相当普通的食物和饮料为特色，比赛看哪位参赛者可以大吃大喝，例如，吃最多的馅饼或香肠，或在规定时间内喝最多的蜂蜜酒或牛奶。为了增加乐趣（或羞辱），参赛者可能必须在双手被绑在背后或有其他障碍的情况下吃或喝。",

	"{@b Broad Jumps}: A broad jump is a jump for maximum horizontal distance. There is a foul line that shows where the jumper must begin their jump; if they step over the line, the jump is treated as a foul and does not count. If the jumper's check results in an 8 or lower, they accidentally step over the foul line and are disqualified. In some cases, only a single jump is allowed, but in formal athletic competitions usually each contestant makes a set number of jumps (from three to six) and keeps their best result. The best overall result wins the contest, and in the case of a tie either both jumpers may be named the winners, or they may compare their second-best result or have them go to an additional jump-off. Long Jump: A long jump is a running jump. Standing Broad Jump: A broad jump is performed from a standing start. Triple Jump: A triple jump, also called a \"hop, skip, and jump\" is a combination of a single running long jump, after which the runner lands and immediately makes a second jump off one foot, and a third jump off of both feet. The third jump is treated as a standing jump with advantage. The total result of the three relevant checks gives the total distance jumped. High Jumps: A high jump is a jump for maximum vertical distance, done by jumping over a bar set at a target height, typically starting at 2 feet for standing jumps, 5 feet for running high jumps, or 10 feet for the pole vault, and all jumpers must clear this qualifying height. Jumpers who clear the height move on in the contest, while those who fail must try again. Jumpers who fail to clear three jumps (regardless of height) are disqualified. A natural 1 on a jump check to perform a high jump is an automatic failure. Once all jumpers have cleared the height or been disqualified, the bar is raised, typically half a foot at a time and the process is repeated. Confident jumpers who clear the qualifying height may pass on jumping at lower heights thereafter in order to save their attempts for later jumps. The process of raising the bar and new attempts for each remaining jumper continues at each new height, with any jumpers accumulating three failed jumps being disqualified. If at the end of all jumps at any height only one jumper left has cleared that height, they are the winner. If two or more jumpers remain, they proceed to the next height and continue the process until only one jumper remains. If neither jumper clears the new height, the jumper with the fewest failed jumps prior to the final height is the winner. If only a single jumper is left and they have not failed three jumps, they may choose to raise the bar and continue trying to clear higher heights for the sake of getting the best possible result, and the may continue trying indefinitely until they fail three jumps or until the sponsor of the contest calls for an ending.": "{@b Broad Jumps}: 宽体跳是一种最大水平距离的跳跃。有一条犯规线，显示了跳远者必须开始跳的位置；如果他们踩过了这条线，则跳远被视为犯规，不计分。如果跳远者的检查结果是8分或更低，他们就会不小心踏过犯规线，被取消资格。在某些情况下，只允许跳一次，但在正式的体育比赛中，通常每个参赛者都要跳一定数量的跳台（从三到六），并保留其最佳成绩。总成绩最好的选手赢得比赛，如果出现平局，要么两个跳远选手都被评为优胜者，要么就比较他们第二好的成绩，或者让他们再进行一次跳远比赛。跳远。跳远是一种跑跳。立定跳远。跳远是以站立方式进行的。三级跳远。三级跳，也叫 \"跳、跳、跳\"，是由一次跑动中的跳远组合而成，跑者落地后立即用一只脚进行第二次跳，然后用双脚进行第三次跳。第三次跳跃被视为具有优势的站立跳跃。三个相关检查的总结果给出了总的起跳距离。跳高。跳高是为了获得最大的垂直距离，通过跳过设置在目标高度的横杆来完成，一般来说，站立跳的起点是2英尺，跑步跳高的起点是5英尺，撑杆跳的起点是10英尺，所有跳高者必须通过这个限定的高度。在比赛中，跳过这个高度的选手继续前进，而失败的选手必须再次尝试。未能通过三跳（无论高度如何）的跳水运动员将被取消资格。在跳高检查中，如果自然1，则自动失败。一旦所有跳高者都跳过了高度或被取消了资格，栏杆就会被抬高，通常每次抬高半英尺，然后再重复这一过程。自信的跳水运动员在通过资格赛的高度后，可以放弃在较低的高度跳水，以便为以后的跳水保留尝试的机会。在每一个新的高度上，都要继续提高栏杆和新的尝试，任何跳跃者累计三次失败都会被取消资格。如果在任何一个高度的所有跳跃结束时，只剩下一个跳跃者通过了该高度，他们就是胜利者。如果还有两个或更多的跳远选手，他们将进入下一个高度，继续这一过程，直到只剩下一个跳远选手。如果两个人都没有跳过新的高度，那么在最后一个高度之前失败次数最少的跳远选手就是赢家。如果只剩下一个跳远者，而且他们没有失败过三次，他们可以选择提高标准，继续尝试清除更高的高度，以获得最好的结果，他们可以无限期地继续尝试，直到他们失败三次，或直到比赛的赞助商要求结束。",
	"For the purpose of the contest, rather than setting a specific height you can use target DCs instead.

Each racer uses this run speed as their base race score.": "{@b Lap Running}: 跑道通常是圆形的，椭圆形的，或者是由弯曲的末端连接的平行直线。准确的形状并不重要，但跑者必须穿过这些曲线，这意味着他们的速度会降低到5英尺，影响他们的运动和冲刺动作。每个赛跑者都用这个跑步速度作为他们的基本比赛得分。",
	"Unlike a sprint race, a lap race proceeds for multiple laps, each taking approximately one minute. On the first round of the race, all racers make an initiative check and add that result to their speed. The top three race scores may choose whether to begin the race as leaders, chasers, or trailers (see below). Leaders are running as hard as they can to take and keep the lead and put distance between themselves and the runners behind them. Chasers keep together and push the pace just enough to keep the leaders within reach without opening too big of a lead. Trailers conserve their energy and follow the leaders and chasers, waiting for fatigue to eliminate their competition and to win with a strong finishing kick.": "与冲刺比赛不同的是，单圈赛进行多圈，每圈大约需要一分钟。在第一轮比赛中，所有选手都要进行主动性检查，并将结果加到他们的速度上。比赛得分前三名可选择以领跑者、追赶者或拖车的身份开始比赛（见下文）。领跑者尽其所能地奔跑，以取得并保持领先，并在自己和后面的选手之间拉开距离。追赶者保持在一起，并推动步伐，使领先者保持在可及的范围内，而不至于拉开太大的差距。追赶者保存体力，跟在领先者和追赶者后面，等待疲劳时消除竞争，以强有力的终结性踢腿取胜。",

The team with the highest total race score is the winner. However, relays are fraught with risk on the exchange, if a racer begins their stage before the previous runner has actually touched them or successfully handed off the relay item. At each exchange, the two racers must each succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check. If both runners fail the check, the exchange is botched and their team is disqualified. If one succeeds and the other fails, the exchange is made but sloppily, and the delay causes the new racer to take a penalty on their race score equal to the margin by which the save was failed (and with disadvantage on a natural 1).": "{@b Relays}: 接力赛只是各队选手之间的比赛，他们必须在彼此之间传递一个戒指、旗子、接力棒或类似的小物件，或者有时只是用手拍打下一个选手，以示开始他们的比赛。第一个选手从起点拿起物品，跑完自己的路线，然后把它交给本队的下一个选手（或拍打他们开始），后者跑自己的比赛，以此类推，直到本队的每个选手都有一次比赛机会。比赛总分最高的队伍就是赢家。然而，如果一个赛手在前一个赛手真正接触到他们或成功交出接力物品之前就开始他们的阶段，那么接力赛在交换时就充满了风险。在每次交换时，两位选手必须各自成功地进行DC 10灵巧检查。如果两位选手都没有通过检查，则交换失败，他们的队伍将被取消资格。如果一个人成功了，另一个人失败了，那么交换就完成了，但是很草率，而且延迟会导致新的选手在比赛中受到惩罚，惩罚的程度相当于挽救失败的幅度（自然1的情况下是不利的）。",
	"{@b Steeplechases}: A steeplechase is a race wherein runners must leap over several obstacles on their way through the race course. Typically, these are logs or similar wooden barriers, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to clear without incident. Each time a runner fails this check, he deducts twice the amount by which he failed the check from his final race score. If he fails the check by 5 or more, he falls prone (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw negates), and does not add anything to his racing score for that turn. If he falls, 1d3-1 other random contestants must attempt an additional Acrobatics check or be forced to stumble or even be knocked prone by the runner as he falls. While in a short sprint, a fall such as this is an automatic loss, in a longer race a runner may have time to get back up and resume running.": "{@b Steeplechases}: 障碍赛是一项比赛，选手必须在比赛过程中跃过几个障碍。通常情况下，这些障碍物是木头或类似的木头障碍物，需要成功的DC15灵巧（杂技）检查才能顺利通过。每次检查失败，他都会从他的最终比赛成绩中扣除检查失败的两倍金额。如果他的检查失败了5次或更多，他就会倒下（DC 15灵巧救赎否定），并且不会为他那一回合的比赛得分增加任何东西。如果他倒下了，1d3-1个其他的随机参赛者必须尝试额外的杂技检查，或者在他倒下时被迫绊倒，甚至被跑者撞倒在地。虽然在短距离冲刺中，像这样的跌倒是自动失败的，但在长距离比赛中，选手可能有时间重新站起来继续跑。",
	"In addition to simple hurdles or barriers, many steeplechase races add additional hazards, such as a pool of water or mud on the far side of the barrier (increasing the DC by 2 or by 5 to avoid stumbling or falling). In more brutal cultures, the barriers themselves or hazards beyond them may be spiked, bladed, laced with caltrops, or otherwise made deadly dangerous, or the barriers may have actual pit traps or similar threats in front of or behind them. Such hazards are resolved as normal for traps, falling damage, etc.": "除了简单的跨栏或障碍之外，许多障碍赛还增加了额外的危险，例如在障碍的远处有一池水或泥浆（增加2或5的DC以避免绊倒或跌倒）。在更残酷的文化中，障碍物本身或障碍物以外的危险可能是带刺的、带刃的、带卡路里的，或其他致命的危险，或者障碍物的前面或后面可能有实际的坑道陷阱或类似的威胁。这种危险的解决方式与正常的陷阱、坠落伤害等一样。",
	"{@b Riding Races}: Riding races combine the abilities of mount and rider to determine a winner. They generally follow the rules for sprint and endurance races, except as described below.

In addition, each rider must make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, adding the result to the mount's race score during the first turn.": "{@b Riding Races}: 骑术比赛结合坐骑和骑手的能力来决定胜负。它们通常遵循短跑和耐力赛的规则，除了以下描述。在比赛的第一轮，骑手进行主动性检查，将坐骑的主动性修正值加入自己的主动性。此外，每个骑手必须进行智慧（动物处理）检查，在第一轮中把结果加到坐骑的比赛得分上。",
	"Mounts carrying a heavy load reduce their speed multiplier by 10 feet when figuring their race score in a sprint or in an endurance race. Constitution checks are made by the mount rather than the rider; however, each time the mount makes a Constitution check to determine its race score, the rider also makes a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, and the rider may use the result of either the mount's check or the rider's to determine the mount's race score for that race turn. Negative effects of a failed Constitution check, such as falling or fatigue, still apply based on the result of the Constitution check itself and cannot be negated by substituting the rider's Wisdom (Animal Handling) check in this way.": "携带重物的坐骑在计算其短跑或耐力赛的比赛成绩时，其速度乘数会减少10英尺。体质检查是由坐骑而不是骑手进行的；然而，每次坐骑进行体质检查以确定其比赛得分时，骑手也会进行智慧（动物处理）检查，并且骑手可以使用坐骑检查或骑手检查的结果来确定坐骑在该比赛回合的比赛得分。体质检查失败的负面效果，例如跌倒或疲劳，仍然基于体质检查本身的结果而适用，不能通过这种方式替代骑手的智慧（动物处理）检查而否定。",
	"{@i Mounted Steeplechases}: These races function as a normal steeplechase, but the mount must make all Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to clear the barriers along the race.

If the obstacle is on fire or is otherwise obviously dangerous, this DC may be increase by 5 or even 10.": "每次坐骑跃过障碍物时，骑手必须成功地进行灵巧（动物处理）检定或从他的坐骑上扔下；这个检定的DC等于灵巧（杂技）检定的DC，以清除障碍物。如果坐骑没有接受过跳跃障碍物的训练，骑手必须用成功的智慧（动物处理）检定来哄骗动物跃过障碍物，检定的DC等于灵巧（杂技）DC，以跃过障碍物。如果障碍物着火或有其他明显的危险，这个DC可以增加5甚至10。",
	"{@i Token Races}: Some riding races involve collecting a token during the course of the race, such as a flag or brightly colored ring or baton, which is typically suspended from a rope or otherwise is difficult to reach and must be snatched without slowing down, since the race requires a combination of speed and successfully grabbing these tokens.": "{@i Token Races}: 有些骑行比赛涉及在比赛过程中收集信物，如旗帜或颜色鲜艳的环形物或接力棒，这些信物通常被悬挂在绳子上或以其他方式难以触及，必须在不减速的情况下抢夺，因为比赛需要速度和成功抓住这些信物的组合。",
	"A spectacular version of this kind of contest is the ring race, wherein fully armored knights propel their gaily caparisoned steeds around the racecourse while they use their lances to grab beribboned rings suspended overhead whose color matches their own. Each race turn, racers can attempt an attack roll against AC 15 (or higher, for contests aimed at higher-level contestants using smaller targets more difficult to catch) to snatch a ring at full speed. Trailers in a ring race gain a +2 bonus on their attack rolls, as their measured pace helps them focus on the dancing and swinging rings overhead. If the attack roll misses by less than 5, there is a 20% chance the attacker accidentally snatches a ring of the wrong color (chosen randomly).": "这种比赛的一个壮观的版本是环形赛，全副武装的骑士推动着他们华丽的骏马在赛马场上奔跑，同时他们用长矛抓住悬挂在头顶上的颜色与自己相配的贝雷布环。每个比赛回合，参赛者可以尝试对AC15（或更高，对于针对更高级别的参赛者的比赛，使用更难抓住的小目标）进行攻击卷，以全速抢夺一个环。擂台赛中的拖车在他们的攻击卷上获得+2的奖励，因为他们有节制的步伐可以帮助他们专注于头顶上跳舞和摆动的环。如果攻击卷的失误少于5，攻击者有20%的机会意外地抢到一个错误颜色的戒指（随机选择）。",

	"History shows us all manner of target shooting and target throwing contests, from lumberjack axe throwing to barroom darts to classic Robin Hood-style archery contests. Accuracy was a key life skill in hunting and training for military service as well, and such contests are commonplace in any festival. While the contests below are described in terms of archery, they can just as easily be undertaken with any kind of ranged weapon, including thrown weapons, with proportionately shorter distances for weapons with shorter range increments.": "历史向我们展示了各种形式的射击和投掷目标的比赛，从伐木工人的斧头投掷到酒吧里的飞镖，再到经典的罗宾汉式射箭比赛。准确度在狩猎和军事训练中也是一项关键的生活技能，这样的比赛在任何节日中都是很常见的。虽然下面的比赛是以射箭来描述的，但它们也可以很容易地用任何种类的远程武器来进行，包括投掷武器，对于射程较短的武器来说，距离会相应缩短。",
	"{@b Clout Shooting}: More common in the Middle Ages than the target shooting we typically envision, clout shooting involved launching arrows at long range in a parabolic arc at a target laid at a low angle or even flat on the ground to simulate loosing volleys of arrows in combat into massed enemy troops or shooting over walls. The clout itself was a simple wooden peg a few inches across inside a circle drawn on the ground or marked with small flags and that might be as small as 2-3 feet across or as large as 25 feet. Modern clout shooting still exists and uses the same principle, but the target is more often a flag or square of cloth and scoring is based on how close archers can get their arrows to it.": "{@b Clout Shooting}: 在中世纪比我们通常设想的打靶更常见，射箭是指在远距离以抛物线的弧度向低角度甚至平放在地上的目标发射箭矢，以模拟战斗中向集结的敌军发射箭矢或越墙射击。靶子本身是一个简单的木桩，几英寸宽，在地面上画一个圆圈，或用小旗子做标记，可能小到2-3英尺宽，大到25英尺。现代射击仍然存在，并使用相同的原则，但目标通常是一面旗子或方形布，得分是基于弓箭手能让他们的箭靠近它。",
	"{@b A clout end has each archer shooting six arrows at the clout peg or flag. If all archers shoot at the same target, each shooter uses fletching that is a different color to tell their arrows apart for scoring. Scoring is as follows.": "{pos(190,8)}{b 碰头结束时，每个弓箭手向碰头钉或旗子射六支箭。如果所有的射手都射向同一个目标，每个射手都用不同颜色的箭矢来区分他们的箭，以便计分。计分方法如下。",

A target-shooting end is six shots for each archer at a Medium-sized target typically 120 feet away.

	"While jousting and even general melee events with blunted lances and swords were a staple of medieval tournaments, unarmed combat events also were very popular and continue to be popular to the present day. Such events often featured traveling champions who would take on local toughs and gallants willing to stake their money for a chance in the ring with the champion. Such events can be run using the standard combat rules for unarmed attacks and combat contest, and this is particularly appropriate in unusual unarmed events such as a humanoid battling a bear, gorilla, or similar creature with natural weapons of its own. However, the following rules below provide a framework for the sweet science of taking down an opponent with bare hands.": "虽然比武和使用钝长矛和剑的一般近战活动是中世纪锦标赛的主要内容，但徒手格斗活动也非常受欢迎，并一直流行到今天。这类活动通常以旅行的冠军为特色，他们会与当地的强盗和英勇者对决，愿意用钱来换取与冠军同场竞技的机会。这类活动可以使用标准的战斗规则来进行徒手攻击和战斗竞赛，这在不寻常的徒手活动中尤其合适，比如一个人形动物与熊、大猩猩或类似的生物进行战斗，并有自己的天然武器。然而，下面的规则为赤手空拳打倒对手的甜蜜科学提供了一个框架。",
	"{@b Performance Combat}: Whether using standard combat rules or the specialized rules described below, it is very appropriate to have contestants attempt to influence the crowd to their side make a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check.

	"{@b Boxing}: Competitors are confined to a small ring, usually a 15-foot square, and set to fighting. Standard boxing is unarmed combat using only the hands, but many cultures may strike with both hands and feet or even with feet alone. Grappling, shoving, and most other combat contests are not allowed. After each round of combat, the boxers are separated and return to their start positions.": "{@b Boxing}: 竞争者被限制在一个小擂台上，通常是一个15英尺的正方形，并设定为战斗。标准的拳击是只用手的徒手格斗，但许多文化可以用手和脚，甚至只用脚进行攻击。擒拿、推搡和大多数其他战斗竞赛是不允许的。每一轮战斗结束后，拳击手们会被分开，回到他们的起始位置。",
	"{@i Gloves}: Traditional boxing is carried out with bare knuckles, but in some societies gloves are used to ablate the impact and reduce injury. Boxers wearing gloves cannot kill their targets, and they deal only half the normal amount of damage with each blow.": "{@i Gloves}: 传统的拳击是用赤裸的指关节进行的，但在一些社会中使用手套来消减冲击力，减少伤害。戴着手套的拳击手不能杀死他们的目标，而且他们每一次击打都只造成正常伤害的一半。",
	"{@i Knockout}: If either competitor is rendered unconscious by the reducing their opponent to 0 hit points, he is knocked out and his opponent is declared the winner. If a fighter confirms a critical hit during a boxing match, the target must make a Constitution saving throw equal to 10 + the damage dealt or gain a level of exhaustion, or two exhaustion levels if they fail the save by 5 or more. Rolling a natural 1 on this save renders the target unconscious. Any exhaustion levels gained in this way are removed when the afflicted boxer finishes a long rest.": "{@i Knockout}: 如果任何一个参赛者被降低对手的命中率至0而失去意识，他将被击倒，他的对手被宣布为胜利者。如果拳手在拳击比赛中确认了关键一击，目标必须做一个相当于10+所受伤害的宪法救赎，或者获得一个等级的疲惫，或者如果他们的救赎失败5或更多，则获得两个疲惫等级。在这个救赎中掷出自然的1，会使目标失去知觉。以这种方式获得的任何疲惫等级会在受影响的拳击手完成长时间休息后被移除。",
	"{@i Rounds}: A boxing match can last any number of rounds agreed upon by the contestants, though usually a minimum of 3 rounds and a maximum of 15. These rounds can be literal combat rounds, or they can be any length stipulated by the combatants, though rarely longer than 1 minute.": "{@i Rounds}: 一场拳击比赛可以持续到参赛者同意的任何数量的回合，但通常最少3个回合，最多15个回合。这些回合可以是字面上的战斗回合，也可以是战斗人员规定的任何长度，但很少超过1分钟。",
	"{@i Scoring}: If neither opponent is knocked unconscious during the duration of the fight, the victor is determined by a scoring system. Each competitor tallies one point per hit and two points for each critical hit. In any round in which a fighter scores more hits than his opponent, he gains one additional bonus point. A fighter can use a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) contest to appear to land more punches than he actually does; this contest is opposed by the passive Perception of the judge(s) scoring the match, and the check is made each round. Both the fighter and the judge(s) add their proficiency bonus to these checks even if they lack proficiency in the appropriate skill as long as they are proficient with unarmed strikes. If a fighter's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check exceeds the Wisdom (Perception) check of the judge(s), he is treated as if he scored 1 additional hit during that round, plus one additional hit for every 5 points by which his check exceeded the judge's highest Wisdom (Perception) check.": "{@i Scoring}: 如果在战斗过程中双方都没有被击倒，则由评分系统决定胜负。每位参赛者每击中一次计1分，每击中一次要害计2分。在任何一个回合中，如果一个战士比他的对手获得更多的命中，他将获得一个额外的奖励点。拳手可以使用灵巧（诡计多端）的比赛，使自己看起来比实际打出更多的拳头；这种比赛是由为比赛评分的裁判的被动感知力来反对的，而且每轮都要进行检查。拳手和裁判都会在这些检查中加入他们的熟练度奖励，即使他们缺乏相应的技能，只要他们精通徒手打击。如果一个战士的灵巧（灵巧）检查超过了裁判的智慧（感知）检查，他将被视为在该回合中获得了1次额外的命中，另外，他的检查每超过裁判的最高智慧（感知）检查5分，就有一次额外的命中。",
	"{@b Special Boxing Rules}: Boxing can proceed using normal unarmed combat rules, or it can incorporate a number of specialized maneuvers and strategies. Bob and Weave: This is the boxing term for using the Dodge action.": "{@b Special Boxing Rules}: 拳击可以使用正常的徒手格斗规则进行，也可以加入一些专门的动作和策略。Bob and Weave: 这是拳击比赛中使用躲避动作的术语。",
	"{@i Clinch}: One boxer grabs onto another as a defensive maneuver to prevent his opponent from landing effective punches. Treat this as a grapple contest. If the target's opposed roll is 5 or more points lower than the grappler, the target is has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of next turn. A referee will usually end the grapple after 1 turn.": "{@i Clinch}: 一名拳击手抓住另一名拳击手作为防守手段，以防止他的对手打出有效的拳头。将此视为一场抓斗比赛。如果目标的反对卷比擒拿手低5分或更多，则目标在攻击卷上有劣势，直到下一回合结束。裁判员通常会在一回合后结束抓斗。",
	"{@i Combination}: As an action, the boxer can make two attacks, but does not add their Strength bonus on either attack.": "{@i Combination}: 作为一个动作，拳击手可以进行两次攻击，但在任何一次攻击中都不增加他们的力量加成。",
	"{@i Counterpunch}: A boxer can use his reaction to attack his opponent as they make their attack. This counterpunch is resolved after his opponent's attack.": "{@i Counterpunch}: 拳击手可以在对手进行攻击时利用他的反应来攻击对手。这个反击在他的对手的攻击之后解决。",
	"{@i Haymaker}: A boxer can put his whole energy into a heavy blow as an action, taking disadvantage on the roll in order to gain a +3 bonus on damage rolls.": "{@i Haymaker}: 拳击手可以将他的全部精力投入到重击中，作为一个动作，在掷骰子时处于劣势，以获得伤害卷上的+3奖励。",
	"{@i Jab}: This is a standard unarmed strike.": "{@i Jab}: 这是一个标准的徒手攻击。",
	"{@i Low Blow}: A blow below the belt is generally considered against the rules, much like a head butt, and in such cases making a low blow without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the passive Perception checks of the judges as described previously. If noticed, a successful low blow does not score a point and results in a 1-point penalty to the attacker. A successful hit with a low blow deals an additional 1d3 points of damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion that goes away after the target finishes a short rest.": "{@i Low Blow}: 腰部以下的打击通常被认为是违反规则的，就像头部撞击一样，在这种情况下，在不被注意的情况下进行低位打击，需要成功的灵巧（灵巧）检查，由裁判的被动感知检查来争夺，如前面所述。如果被注意到，成功的低击不得分，并导致攻击者被罚1分。一个成功的低空打击会造成额外的1d3点伤害。此外，目标必须做一个DC 8的宪法救赎动作，或者获得一个级别的疲惫，这个疲惫在目标完成短暂的休息后会消失。",
	"{@b Wrestling}: Wrestling is a contest of combat maneuvers, especially (but not exclusively) the grapple contest. Shove contests are used to take a foe to the ground and make them easier to pin, while in other forms of wrestling such as sumo the object is to force the opponent out of the ring. Matches can be simple submission contests, wherein the match continues until one wrestler is subdued through maintaining a grapple for a certain number of rounds. Wrestling matches typically occur in a 15-foot diameter ring (which may be round or square), though larger rings may be use for tag team or group wrestling matches. The rules below present a formalized scoring system that can be used to reward specific maneuvers and outcomes.": "{@b Wrestling}: 摔跤是一种战斗技巧的比赛，特别是（但不限于）擒拿比赛。摔跤比赛是用来把敌人按在地上，使他们更容易被钉住，而在其他形式的摔跤中，如相扑，目的是把对手逼出擂台。比赛可以是简单的屈服比赛，即比赛继续进行，直到一个摔跤手通过保持一定数量的抓握被制服。摔跤比赛通常发生在一个直径15英尺的擂台上（可以是圆形或方形），尽管更大的擂台可以用于标记团队或团体摔跤比赛。下面的规则提出了一个正式的计分系统，可以用来奖励特定的动作和结果。",
	"{@i Duration}: A wrestling match usually lasts a set number of rounds (usually 10, 12, or 15), though the match can end early if one wrestler maintains a grapple for 3 rounds. If neither wrestler can maintain, the match is decided on total points. If the score is tied at the end of the set duration, the match continues in a sudden death format, where the first wrestler to outscore his opponent in a round wins the match.": "{@i Duration}: 摔跤比赛通常持续一定数量的回合（通常为10、12或15），但如果一个摔跤手保持3个回合的抓握，比赛可以提前结束。如果两个摔跤手都不能保持，比赛将根据总分决定。如果在设定的持续时间结束时比分相同，比赛将以突然死亡的形式继续进行，即在一个回合中第一个胜过对手的摔跤手赢得比赛。",
	"{@i Exhaustion}: Wrestling matches take a considerable amount of energy. A wrestler can wrestle for a number of rounds equal to one-half his Constitution score before risking exhaustion. After this time, each wrestler must succeed at a DC 10 Constitution check or gain an exhaustion level at the end of each round. The DC increases by 1 for each round thereafter. When a wrestler gains an exhaustion level, the DC resets to 10 but additional checks must be made each round to avoid gaining further levels. A wrestler using a Dodge action does not need to make a Constitution check that round and reduces the DC of subsequent checks by 1. Exhaustion levels gained are never lethal and are removed after a short rest.": "{@i Exhaustion}: 摔跤比赛需要相当多的能量。摔跤手在冒着筋疲力尽的危险之前，可以摔跤的回合数等于他体质得分的二分之一。在这之后，每个摔跤手必须在DC10宪法检查中取得成功，否则在每轮结束时获得一个疲惫等级。此后的每一回合，DC增加1。当摔跤手获得一个疲惫等级时，DC重置为10，但每轮必须进行额外的检查以避免获得更多等级。使用闪避动作的摔跤手不需要在该回合进行体质检查，并将后续检查的DC减少1。所获得的疲惫等级永远不会致命，并在短暂的休息后消除。",
	"{@i Give and Take}: Scoring occurs at the end of each round of a wrestling match. A grapple that is not maintained to the end of the opponent's turn scores no points.": "{@i Give and Take}: 计分发生在摔跤比赛的每个回合结束时。没有维持到对手回合结束的抓斗不得分。",
	"{@i Showboating}: Wrestling bouts can be simple athletic endeavors, or they can be grand spectacles with casts of colorful costumed characters with outlandish names and costumes to match, from masked luchadors or gloriously spangled and sequined performers with catchphrases, capes, props, and bombastic entrance music. These endeavors may still be highly athletic (though in some cases they may follow a prearranged script as to who wins or loses a match), but a Charisma (Athletics) check can be made in place of a Strength (Athletics) check.": "{@i Showboating}: 摔跤比赛可以是简单的运动项目，也可以是盛大的场面，由色彩斑斓的人物组成，他们的名字和服装都很怪异，有戴面具的斗牛士，也有光鲜亮丽的表演者，还有口头禅、斗篷、道具和轰鸣的入场音乐。这些努力可能仍然是高度运动性的（尽管在某些情况下，他们可能遵循预先安排好的比赛输赢的剧本），但可以用魅力（运动）检查来代替力量（运动）检查。",
	"{@i Tag Team}: This style of wrestling pits two teams against each other, though only one wrestler from each team is on the mat at a time. At any time during the match, a wrestler can tag their partner and then exit the ring, while their partner enters the fray in their place. The partner outside the ring must stay in a specific location and cannot move around the ring to get closer to their partner.": "{@i Tag Team}: 这种风格的摔跤让两队人马互相对抗，但每队人马每次只有一个摔跤手在垫子上。在比赛的任何时候，一个摔跤手可以标记他们的伙伴，然后退出擂台，而他们的伙伴则代替他们进入战场。擂台外的搭档必须呆在一个特定的位置，不能在擂台上移动以接近他们的搭档。",
	"{@i Team Wrestling}: Some wrestling matches pit evenly matched teams against one another, with all wrestlers in the match at once. Scoring proceeds as described below, and wrestlers may choose to combine their efforts to pin and hold one of their opponents or may engage in multiple one-on-one grapples simultaneously. A wrestler who is grappled and held for three rounds is out of the match and the bout continues until all of one team's wrestlers have been eliminated, or based on the aggregate score for each team if both teams still have wrestlers remaining at the end of the match. Any successful point-scoring move by a wrestler counts toward the aggregate total for their team.": "{@i Team Wrestling}: 有些摔跤比赛是由势均力敌的队伍对阵，所有摔跤手同时参加比赛。计分过程如下所述，摔跤手可以选择合力夹住一个对手，也可以同时进行多个一对一的擒拿。被擒抱的摔跤手在三个回合内出局，比赛继续进行，直到一队的所有摔跤手都被淘汰，如果两队在比赛结束时仍有摔跤手，则根据每队的总得分计算。摔跤手的任何成功计分动作都计入本队的总分。",
	"{@i Unsportsmanlike Conduct}: In a wrestling match, you often can escape the view of any judges or referees, and dirty tricks can be used to put an opponent in a compromising position and gain advantage. Using an illegal hold or an unsportsmanlike maneuver such as an eye gouge, groin grab, strike with a closed fist, and so on without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check opposed by the passive Perception checks of the judges and your opponent. This is a bonus action, and you may choose one of the following options:": "{@i Unsportsmanlike Conduct}: 在摔跤比赛中，你经常可以躲过任何裁判员的视线，肮脏的伎俩可以用来将对手置于不利的位置并获得优势。在不被注意的情况下使用非法的抱摔或不符合体育道德的动作，如挖眼、抓腹股沟、用闭合的拳头击打等等，需要成功的灵巧（灵巧）检查，并与裁判和对手的被动感知检查相对立。这是一个额外动作，你可以选择以下选项之一。",

This also can be accomplished with a grapple when you force the opponent to move.": "@b相扑}。相扑和类似形式的摔跤并不依靠抓住对手，而是通过推搡比赛将对手逼到地上或摔出场外。当你迫使对手移动时，这也可以通过抓斗来完成。",
	"Both wrestlers begin near the center of a 15- or 20foot ring, and must force their opponent back or to the side 10 feet to force them out of the ring, or knock them prone. Both wrestlers begin from a set position marked within the ring and roll initiative at the beginning of the match. In some cultures, the rules of sumo are considered sacred, and any unsportsmanlike conduct noticed by the judges is grounds for immediate disqualification and forfeit of the match. If you use a 15-foot ring, assume both wrestlers begin in the center square; if you wish a bit more movement opportunity using a standard grid of 5-foot squares, a 20-foot ring may work better.": "双方摔跤手从15或20英尺的擂台中心附近开始，必须将对手逼退或逼到10英尺以外，将其逼出擂台，或将其击倒在地。双方摔跤手都从圈内标记的固定位置开始，并在比赛开始时进行主动滚动。在一些文化中，相扑的规则被认为是神圣的，任何被裁判注意到的不符合体育道德的行为都会被立即取消资格并被罚下场。如果你使用15英尺的擂台，假设两个摔跤手都从中间的方格开始；如果你希望使用5英尺的标准方格有更多的运动机会，20英尺的擂台可能效果更好。",

In a single contest, two wrestlers might have five matches, with the winner determined by whomever wins the most individual matches. Tradition dictates that all matches in the set are completed, even if one wrestler has an insurmountable advantage in that set, both for the loser to demonstrate stoic aplomb in defeat and to determine total number of matches won if the sumo event stretches over multiple days and involves multiple wrestlers, as the winner of the highest aggregate total number of matches at the end of the event is the grand champion of that event.": "{@b Scoring}: 相扑比赛通常由一定数量的比赛组成，可以在同一天内进行，也可以在数天内进行。在一次比赛中，两名摔跤手可能有五场比赛，由谁赢得最多个人比赛决定胜负。传统规定，所有的比赛都要完成，即使一个摔跤手在该组比赛中具有不可逾越的优势，这既是为了让失败者在失败中表现出谦逊的风度，也是为了在相扑比赛持续多天、涉及多名摔跤手的情况下确定赢得的总场次，因为在比赛结束时总场次最多的赢家是该赛事的总冠军。",

These are especially appropriate if your festival games happen in a specific location, where a permanent stadium or arena is renowned for its famous and unique challenges, but they also could be used at any festival set up in the fringes of a young forest kingdom where the spirit of magic and adventure is strong.": "虽然前面的部分详细介绍了现实世界的历史和文化中一系列熟悉的竞赛，但这是一个幻想游戏，在一个更高的魔法活动中，或者一个以更高等级的角色为特色的活动中，完全可以提高你的比赛活动的难度和复杂性。如果你的节日游戏发生在一个特定的地点，那里的永久体育场或竞技场以其著名和独特的挑战而闻名，这些就特别合适，但它们也可以用在任何设置在年轻森林王国边缘的节日，那里的魔法和冒险精神很强。",

This is true even if another contestant has charged the majority of the energy into the pillar; it is the contestant who pushes the pillar beyond 100 radiant or necrotic hit points that captures it (this includes creatures summoned by a contestant). Captured pillars become amazingly durable (AC 18, Damage Threshold 8, 180 hit points).": "每位参赛者都会得到一块彩色令牌，当他们使石柱达到100点正值或100点负值时，他们就会 \"捕获 \"该石柱，因为它完全变成白色（辐射）或黑色（坏死），安装在石柱顶部的水晶球也会发出他们的颜色的亮光。即使另一位参赛者将大部分能量注入石柱也是如此；只有将石柱推到超过100个辐射或坏死命中率的参赛者才能捕获它（这包括由参赛者召唤的生物）。被俘虏的柱子会变得惊人地持久（AC18，伤害阈值8，180点命中率）。",

	"In jousting circles, legends speak of a dreadful beast who roams the land to and fro, seeking whom he may devour among those who embody the chivalric ideal and who seek to demonstrate their purity and puissance on the tournament lists. Faceless and nameless \"black knights\" throughout the years have sought titles of achievement and honor in the tourneys while keeping their identity a secret, or have hidden their past shame beneath a mask or hood while they sought to repair their honor. Most trueborn and honorable knights avoid confrontations with them for fear of besmirching their own reputation by losing to an opponent of no repute (with little renown to be gained even in victory), and such knights typically have no recourse to compel their challenge to be answered. However, for decades knights who have refused challenges from nameless foes have been found murdered, their bodies battered, charred, and mutilated, with scarcely a trace found of their killers but a crude, sooty black mask drawn in the dirt. On a few occasions, a suspect has been found and even tried and condemned for such murders, protesting their innocence all the way, but even after their execution the respite was short before the murders began again, always with the same modus operandi.": "在比武界，传说有一头可怕的野兽，它在这片土地上来回游荡，在那些体现骑士精神的人中寻找他可以吞噬的对象，并试图在比武名单上展示他们的纯洁和威力。多年来，无脸无名的 \"黑骑士 \"在比赛中寻求成就和荣誉的头衔，同时对自己的身份保密，或者将过去的耻辱藏在面具或头巾下，同时寻求修复他们的荣誉。大多数真正的、有荣誉感的骑士都避免与他们对抗，因为他们害怕输给一个没有名望的对手而玷污自己的声誉（即使胜利也没有什么名望），而且这些骑士通常没有办法迫使他们的挑战得到回应。然而，几十年来，那些拒绝无名敌人挑战的骑士都被发现被谋杀，他们的尸体被殴打、烧焦和肢解，几乎找不到凶手的踪迹，只有一个粗糙的、沾满烟尘的黑色面具画在泥土上。有几次，嫌疑人被发现，甚至被审判，并因这种谋杀被判刑，他们一直抗议自己是无辜的，但即使在他们被处决后，在谋杀再次开始之前，他们的喘息时间很短，总是以同样的方式进行。",

Not content to lure mortals of good heart to their doom through the typical sin of lust, she devised a rare plan to play upon pride and wrath, seeking out those paragons of goodness and mercy who sought to rise in public esteem and to be inspirations to the people at large. Her bestial son would instead seek them out in the guise of a common steed, or recruit a rider for himself willing to help take down the proud and the mighty, humiliating them on the field before slaughtering them once their fame and renown had been destroyed.

He devises a plot to murder the target by infiltrating the jousting stables disguised as an ordinary horse, suppressing his smoke and flaming hooves. He attempts to lure the target into riding him, replacing grooms and valets with his own minions or intimidating others into sending PCs his way, making excuses about why other horses cannot be used in the list. Once a PC has mounted Ashavin, he uses magic to attempt to swiftly kill his rider.

Whereas a Holiday Edict declares days to celebrate on the calendar across the length and breadth of your kingdom, a Festival Edict is a specific, onetime event (though it could be repeated later) focused in a particular place at a particular time for a particular purpose. A Festival may be called for any reason or for no reason at all and include tournaments, games, music, dancing, feasting, drinking, parades, fireworks or magical displays, and similar entertainments of all kinds, but each one undertaken with special magnificence.

Once it has been used, it cannot be used again until 3 days have passed.": "{@b Iron Bull} （不常见）。这个4英寸高的铁制雕像可以变成温顺的高竿（怪物手册，第171页），持续24小时。就像 \"机械公牛 \"一样，高竿会试图将骑手赶走，但一旦他们离开，就不会再努力践踏或撕咬他们。一旦它被使用，在3天之后才能再次使用。",
	"{@b Granite Pony} (Common). This granite figurine can become a gray pony of medium size for 6 hours. Though technically \"friendly\" toward the user and their allies, the pony has a mean disposition and can be uncooperative. When attempting to ride the pony, make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check against a DC 15 to avoid being bitten or bucked. Once it has been used, it cannot be used again until 24 hours have passed.": "{@b Granite Pony}（普通）。这个花岗岩雕像可以变成一匹中等大小的灰色小马，持续6小时。虽然在技术上对使用者和他们的盟友很 \"友好\"，但这匹小马的性格很刻薄，可能不合作。当试图骑小马时，要对DC15进行智慧（动物处理）检查，以避免被咬或被扣。一旦它被使用，在24小时内不能再次使用。",
	"5 bolts, arrows, or other ammunition. When used to hit a target, the target does a DC13 wisdom save, a fail makes the target fall unconscious for 10 minutes, until the sleeper takes damage, or someone takes an action to wake them.": "5个螺栓、箭或其他弹药。当用来击中目标时，目标会进行DC13智慧救赎，失败会使目标昏迷10分钟，直到睡眠者受到伤害，或有人采取行动将其唤醒。"
