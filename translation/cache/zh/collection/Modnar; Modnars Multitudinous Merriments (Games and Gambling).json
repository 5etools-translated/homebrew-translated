	"The Illusionist's Ball is a deadly game of creativity and deception played between two or more spellcasters who favor illusion and enchantment magic. Usually, this game is played in secret. For each spellcaster that participates, three or more bystanders will also be involved in the game.": "幻术师之球是一个致命的创造力和欺骗的游戏，在两个或更多偏爱幻术和魔法的施法者之间进行。通常情况下，这个游戏是秘密进行的。每一个参与的施法者，三个或更多的旁观者也会参与到游戏中。",
	"The game takes place at a ball, or some other social gathering, such as a banquet, a dance, or a wedding. Each spellcaster must disguise themselves using illusion magic (the most common spell for this is disguise self) and also create an illusory person, called a Fake, to inhabit the ball. Illusory people are controlled by the DM, but their actions and response must be loosely dictated by the player that created them in advance. Each player is allowed five sentences of description for their illusory character.": "游戏发生在一个舞会上，或其他一些社交聚会，如宴会、舞会或婚礼上。每个施法者都必须使用幻觉魔法来伪装自己（最常见的咒语是伪装自己），同时创造一个虚幻的人，称为 \"假人\"，在舞会上居住。虚幻的人由DM控制，但他们的行动和反应必须由创造他们的玩家事先松散地支配。每个玩家可以为他们的虚幻人物描述五句话。",
	"The goal of game is to find and stealthily kill all of the other players' Fakes (a Fake vanishes upon death), while keeping your Fake undiscovered. Killing a bystander or a player is grounds for disqualification, as is using spells that detect the presence of illusions, such as detect magic or true seeing. Other magic, such as enchantment spells, are encouraged, and can be cast upon bystanders or other players to gain an edge in the game. Revealing that an Illusionist's Ball is taking place to a bystander is also grounds for disqualification.": "游戏的目标是找到并隐蔽地杀死所有其他玩家的假人（假人死后会消失），同时保持你的假人不被发现。杀害旁观者或玩家会被取消资格，使用检测幻象的法术也会被取消资格，如检测魔法或真视。其他魔法，如魔法咒语，是被鼓励的，可以对旁观者或其他玩家施放，以获得游戏中的优势。向旁观者透露正在举行的幻术舞会也是取消资格的理由。",
	"The immortal test of a spellcaster's might is the Spell Duel, a contest that directly pits the arcane power of two spellcasters against one another. Both spellcasters must have an arcane focus to participate in a spell duel. The duel happens in a continuous stream of arcane energy, but can be thought of by players as occurring in rounds.": "咒语决斗是对施法者力量的不朽考验，这是一场直接让两个施法者的奥术力量相互对抗的竞赛。两个施法者都必须有一个奥术焦点才能参加法术决斗。决斗是在连续的奥术能量流中进行的，但玩家可以认为是分回合进行的。",
	"At the beginning of each round, each spellcaster expends one spell slot up their choice in secret. Each spellcaster then makes an ability check using their spellcasting ability, adding the spell slot's level to the roll, and adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient with the Arcana skill. When a spellcaster loses this skill contest three times, their arcane focus breaks and they lose the duel.": "在每个回合开始时，每个施法者都要秘密地消耗一个他们选择的法术槽。然后每个施法者使用他们的法术能力进行能力检查，在卷轴上加上法术槽的等级，如果他们精通奥术技能，则加上他们的熟练度奖励。当一个施法者在这场技能竞赛中输掉三次时，他们的奥术焦点就会中断，并失去决斗。",
	"Alternatively, a spell duel can be a lethal contest, in which case the spellcasters eschew the use of arcane focuses and channel their arcane energy directly at one another. In this variation, when a spellcaster loses the skill contest, they take 1d6 force damage for every level of the slot expended by their opponent.": "另外，法术决斗也可以是一场致命的竞赛，在这种情况下，施法者放弃使用奥术焦点，直接向对方输送奥术能量。在这种变化中，当施法者在技能竞赛中失败时，他们会因对手消耗的每一级槽而受到1d6的力量伤害。",
	"Above all else, Summoner's Chess is a two-spellcaster game of strategy. This game takes place on a large 40-foot by 40-foot board, whose 5-foot by 5-foot tiles alternate between white and black -- essentially a massive chess board, though some summoners use hexagonal variants on the board. Each spellcaster can summon monsters to occupy the 15 nearest tiles on their side of the board (for non-standard boards, this number is always one less than one fourth the total number of tiles.) The most popular spells used for this task are conjure animals, conjure woodland beings, find familiar, and occasionally conjure minor elementals, though very powerful spellcasters might cast conjure celestial or conjure elemental once each. Each spellcaster can concentrate on more than one conjuration spell for the duration of the game (making only a single Constitution check for all their spells to maintain concentration), but these spells immediately end when the game is complete.": "最重要的是，召唤师之棋是一种双施法者的策略游戏。这个游戏发生在一个40英尺×40英尺的大棋盘上，其5英尺×5英尺的牌在白色和黑色之间交替出现--本质上是一个巨大的国际象棋棋盘，尽管有些召唤师在棋盘上使用六边形的变体。每个施法者都可以召唤怪物来占据棋盘上离自己最近的15张牌（对于非标准棋盘，这个数字总是比总牌数的四分之一少一个）。这个任务最常用的法术是召唤动物、召唤林地生物、寻找熟人，偶尔也会召唤小元素，不过非常强大的施法者可能会分别施展一次召唤天体或召唤元素。在游戏期间，每个施法者都可以专注于一个以上的魔法咒语（对他们所有的咒语只做一次宪法检查以保持专注），但这些咒语在游戏结束时立即结束。",
	"Once each spellcaster has populated their side of the board, they also take a place on the board. The objective of the game is to harry the opposing spellcaster to lose concentration on their spells. If a spellcaster loses concentration on their spells, they lose the game.": "一旦每个施法者在棋盘上填满了自己的一方，他们也会在棋盘上占一个位置。游戏的目的是骚扰对方的施法者，使其失去对法术的注意力。如果一个施法者失去了对其法术的注意力，他们就会输掉比赛。",
	"Spellcasters take turns commanding their summons to move around the board. On each turn, a spellcaster can only move one summoned creature and command it to take an action. Many spellcasters play with a variation allowing a player to command 2 summoned creatures of CR 1/2 or lower or 3 summoned creatures of CR 1/4 or lower on a single turn. Each creature can only occupy one space and can attack opposed creatures on adjacent spaces, regardless of its size. A spellcaster can't cast any spells once the game has begun.": "施法者轮流指挥他们的召唤物在棋盘上移动。在每个回合中，施法者只能移动一个召唤物，并命令它采取一个行动。许多施法者使用一种变体，允许玩家在一个回合内指挥2个CR 1/2或更低的召唤生物或3个CR 1/4或更低的召唤生物。每个生物只能占据一个空间，并且可以攻击相邻空间的敌对生物，无论其大小如何。一旦游戏开始，施法者就不能施放任何法术。",
	"Some spellcasters (especially warmages) play with fairly sophisticated rules for this game, such as implementing rules for Castling and en passant, but these are not standard.": "一些施法者（尤其是暖男）在这个游戏中使用了相当复杂的规则，比如执行城堡和通行的规则，但这些都不是标准规则。",
	"Mortals and gods alike have been playing games of luck since the dawn of times. Sometimes for leisure, other times for determining dramatic outcomes. In ancient times, Jergal bequeathed his kingdoms of undeath after a game of knuckbones. Zeus allocated divine domains to his sibilings by a random draw. Romulus and Remus settled tehir dispute by watching the skies for birds. When it comes to taking arbitrary decisions, a game of chance is the fairest of all.": "自古以来，凡人和众神都在玩运气游戏。有时是为了休闲，有时是为了决定戏剧性的结果。在古代，Jergal在一场指骨游戏后将他的不死王国遗赠给了别人。宙斯通过随机抽签将神圣的领域分配给他的兄弟姐妹。罗穆卢斯和莱姆斯通过观察天空中的鸟类来解决他们的争端。当涉及到任意决定时，机会的游戏是最公平的。",

	"The centrepiece of any tourney is the chaotic brawl known as the 'melee'. In this massive fight, where dozens or even hundreds of warriors fight it out with sword, axe and mace, combat is governed by strict rules of chivalry, and killing your foes is disallowed. Melee is divided into Free-for-All, in which the last contestant standing wins, and the Team contests, where warriors are split into two sides that engage each other in formation. Team melees, are further divided into mounted and dismounted battles - mounted fights are generally preferred by audiences, but may not be feasible if there is a shortage of knights or warhorses.": "任何巡回赛的核心是被称为 \"混战 \"的混乱争斗。在这场大规模的战斗中，几十个甚至几百个战士用剑、斧头和狼牙棒进行战斗，战斗受到严格的骑士精神规则的约束，不允许杀死你的敌人。混战分为 \"自由对决 \"和 \"团队竞赛\"，在前者中，最后站立的选手获胜，而在后者中，战士们被分成两方，以队形相互交战。团队近战又分为骑马和不骑马的战斗--观众一般喜欢骑马的战斗，但如果缺少骑士或战马，可能就不可行了。",
	"In a melee, fighters must wield melee weapons, though thrown weapons such as javelins may be permitted. It is most unchivalrous to use lethal force in a melee (though accidents can happen) and anyone seen striking an opponent who is on the ground will be disqualified and ejected from the arena. Magic is usually restricted to magic items only, though some melees may allow spells with a range of touch or self to be used.": "在近战中，选手必须使用近战武器，但也允许使用标枪等投掷武器。在近战中使用致命武力是非常不道德的（尽管意外可能发生），任何被看到打击倒在地上的对手的人都将被取消资格并被逐出赛场。魔法通常只限于魔法物品，但有些混战可能允许使用范围为触摸或自身的法术。",
	"Fighters may voluntarily retire from a melee at any stage by taking an action on their turn to lay down their weapons and declare themselves out of action. Anyone who attacks a retired fighter will be disqualified.": "斗士可以在任何阶段自愿退出混战，在他们的回合中采取行动，放下他们的武器并宣布自己退出行动。任何攻击退役战士的人都将被取消资格。",
	"You can perform this action on a prone opponent within 5 feet of you, as long as you are not within the reach of any standing opponents. When you take the Eliminate action, the target is immediately disqualified from the melee and must drop their weapons at the next opportunity and leave the fighting area by the shortest available route. Anyone who attacks an eliminated combatant will also be disqualified.": "只要你不在任何站立对手的范围内，你就可以对你5英尺内的俯卧对手执行这个动作。当你采取消除行动时，目标会立即被取消近战资格，并且必须在下一次机会中放下武器，以最短的可用路线离开战斗区域。任何攻击被淘汰的战斗人员的人也将被取消资格。",
	"Before the fight, determine the number of fighters (including the PCs) that will be participating. To calculate this quickly, you can roll 12d10 or 1d12*10 (minimum 40). Melee fighters will be a mixture of warriors; you may wish to use the knight, veteran, thug and berserker stat blocks to represent them.": "在战斗之前，确定将参加战斗的战士（包括NPC）的数量。为了快速计算，你可以滚动12d10或1d12*10（最少40）。近战战士将是战士的混合体；你可能希望使用骑士、老兵、暴徒和狂战士的状态块来代表他们。",
	"Though the melee is large and filled with combatants, the players will only attract the attention of a few enemies at a time while many more fight and are eliminated elsewhere in the brawl. Therefore, the player's battle takes place within a 25 ft. x 25 ft. square area of the arena - one of many such areas - wherein enemy combatants routinely surge. If a PC exits this area while there are other combatants in the arena, they provoke an opportunity attack from a random combatant for every 10 feet they travel.": "虽然近战的规模很大，而且充满了战斗人员，但玩家每次只会吸引几个敌人的注意，而更多的敌人则在争斗的其他地方战斗和被淘汰掉。因此，玩家的战斗发生在竞技场的一个25英尺×25英尺的方形区域内--许多这样的区域之一--敌人的战斗人员经常会涌入这里。如果一个人在竞技场内有其他战斗人员时离开这个区域，他们每走10英尺就会引起一个随机战斗人员的机会攻击。",
	"At the beginning of the melee, and at the beginning of each turn of combat, roll 1d8. That many enemies enter the player's section of the arena on that turn (provided there is space for them to enter at the periphery of the arena). This is called a Melee Round. The battle has a number of Melee Rounds based upon the number of fighters in the brawl. To determine the number of Melee Rounds, divide the total number of fighters by 2 (rounding down, if necessary), and continue dividing by 2 until the result is 1 or lower. The number of times you divided to reach this result is the number of Melee Rounds.": "在近战开始时，以及在每一回合的战斗开始时，滚动1d8。在该回合中，有这么多的敌人进入玩家的竞技场区域（只要在竞技场的外围有空间让他们进入）。这被称为近战回合。战斗的近战回合数是根据争斗中的战士数量而定的。要确定近战回合数，需要用战士总数除以2（必要时向下取整），然后继续除以2，直到结果为1或更低。你除以这个结果的次数就是近战回合的数量。",
	"After the Melee Rounds are complete, the PCs still have to contend with the remaining combatants in the arena, possibly including each other, before the melee is complete.": "在近战回合结束后，在近战结束前，NPC仍然要与竞技场上剩余的战斗人员（可能包括彼此）进行较量。",
	"In a Free-for-All melee, all enemy combatants that enter combat on a melee round are hostile to the party, whereas in Team melee, only half are hostile, whereas the other half are friendly, and will fight alongside that party. Free-for-All melee continues until only one combatant is left standing, whereas Team melee continues until only one team remains.": "在自由混战中，所有在混战回合中进入战斗的敌方战斗人员都对本方有敌意，而在团队混战中，只有一半是敌方，而另一半是友方，并将与本方一起战斗。自由混战一直持续到只剩下一个战斗人员，而团队混战则一直持续到只剩下一个团队。",
	"One of the most spectacular sights at a tourney is the thunderous crash of lance against shield that signifies a pair of knights tilting at each other in a joust. At a tourney, jousts are usually held as part of a knockout competition where winning knights advance through a series of rounds until just two finalists are left to compete for the prize.": "巡回赛中最壮观的景象之一是长枪对盾牌的雷鸣般的撞击声，这意味着一对骑士在比武中相互倾轧。在巡回赛中，比武通常作为淘汰赛的一部分举行，获胜的骑士通过一系列的比赛晋级，直到只剩下两个决赛选手来争夺奖金。",
	"Jousts are conducted as a set number of charges (usually 3), ending early if a rider is unhorsed and thus automatically defeated. If neither rider is unhorsed after 3 rounds, the winner is decided by points, with 1 point scored for each accurate hit on the opponent's shield and 2 points for each lance broken against the opponent. If the result is still a tie, the audience will vote on a winner. Local heroes, charismatic fan favourites and well-groomed horses have a clear edge if it comes down to a vote.": "比武以设定的冲锋次数进行（通常为3次），如果有骑手未骑马，则提前结束，从而自动落败。如果3轮过后，两个骑手都没有骑马，则以积分决定胜负，每准确击中对手的盾牌得1分，每折断对手的长矛得2分。如果结果仍是平局，观众将投票决定胜负。如果要投票的话，当地的英雄、有魅力的粉丝喜欢的人和精心打扮的马匹都有明显的优势。",
	"For each charge, initiative is determined by a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Attacks are then made as normal against the target's AC, and any damage that would be dealt on a hit is instead dealt to the lance. Tourney lances have 10 HP and are replaced after each charge even if not broken. It should be noted that if the knight going second is unhorsed, they cannot attack, and they have disadvantage on their attack if they were struck but not unhorsed. If the initiative roll is tied, both characters attack at the same time and either or both could potentially be unhorsed. Characters with the Extra Attack feature cannot use it in a joust, but characters with the Mounted Combatant feat have advantage on the attack roll.": "对于每次冲锋，主动权由智慧（动物处理）检查决定。然后按照正常的方式对目标的AC进行攻击，任何被击中的伤害都会对长矛造成伤害。巡回赛长矛有10个HP，每次冲锋后都会被替换，即使没有被打破。需要注意的是，如果第二个上场的骑士没有被击中，他们就不能攻击，如果他们被击中但没有被击中，他们的攻击就有劣势。如果主动权卷轴打成平手，则两个角色同时攻击，其中一个或两个都有可能被解马。具有额外攻击功能的角色不能在比武中使用，但具有骑马战斗者特技的角色在攻击卷上有优势。",
	"If a knight is hit, they must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to the damage rolled. On a failure, they are unhorsed. When a rider is unhorsed, they make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone and are stunned for one round after falling. If the save is failed by 5 or more, the rider also suffers a {@table random lingering injury|lingering injury|DMG} as per the table on page 272 of the DMG.": "如果骑士被击中，他们必须做一个力量救赎，其DC等于所受伤害。如果失败，他们就会被卸下马匹。当骑士被解开时，他们必须做一个DC15的灵巧蓄力动作。如果失败，他们就会倒下，并且在倒下后被击晕一回合。如果救赎失败5次或更多，骑手也会受到{@table random lingering injury|lingering injury|DMG}的伤害，如DMG第272页的表格所示。",
	"A particularly noble and genteel crowd might object to the violence and danger inherent in regular jousting, preferring instead that the knights demonstrate their grace and finesse by spearing a series of hanging rings.": "一个特别高贵和有风度的人群可能会反对常规比武中固有的暴力和危险，而更喜欢骑士们通过刺穿一系列吊环来展示他们的优雅和狡猾。",
	"In ring jousting, knights take turns to complete a course that features a number of set of rings. They have to choose whether to aim at the larger, smaller or medium sized ring from each set. The largest ring has and AC of 12 and is worth 1 point, the medium ring has an AC of 15 and is worth 2 points and the smallest ring has an AC of 18 and is worth 3 points. The knight with the most points at the end of the course wins. Knights must use their Dexterity instead of Strength to attack when jousting at rings.": "在擂台比武中，骑士们轮流完成一个具有若干套擂台的课程。他们必须选择是否瞄准每组中较大、较小或中等大小的环。最大的环的AC为12，价值1分，中等环的AC为15，价值2分，最小的环的AC为18，价值3分。课程结束时，积分最多的骑士获胜。骑士在擂台比武时必须使用他们的灵巧而不是力量来进行攻击。",
	"On the other hand, some crowds want to see blood. Jousting can be made much grittier and more dangerous by having the knights continue to fight on foot after one has been unhorsed.": "另一方面，有些观众希望看到流血。比武可以通过让骑士们在一个人被卸下马后继续步行战斗而变得更加狡猾和危险。",
	"In these extended bouts, a mounted knight must dismount immediately when their opponent is unhorsed - it should be assumed that the horse moves 60 feet before the rider's next turn, though they can attempt to dismount halfway through this move as a reaction to seeing their opponent fall with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (on a failure, they fall prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage). They must then draw a melee weapon (usually a longsword or a mace) and continue the fight on foot until one of the knights yields or is knocked unconscious.": "在这些长时间的战斗中，当他们的对手被卸下马时，骑马的骑士必须立即下马--应该假定马在骑手的下一个回合之前移动了60英尺，尽管他们可以尝试在这个移动的中途下马，作为看到他们的对手倒下的反应，成功地进行DC 15灵巧（杂技）检查（如果失败，他们会倒地并受到2d6重击的伤害）。然后他们必须拔出近战武器（通常是长剑或狼牙棒），继续步行战斗，直到其中一个骑士屈服或被击倒。",
	"The melee and the jousting are the main events at a tourney. However, both of these events are relatively short-lived, and insufficient to occupy hundreds or even thousands of visitors for the duration of the show. Thus, an assortment of sideactivities are laid on, such as the following...": "混战和比武是巡回赛的主要项目。然而，这两项活动都是相对短暂的，不足以让数百甚至数千名游客在整个表演期间都能得到满足。因此，会有各种各样的辅助活动，例如以下活动......",
	"While competition in melee and jousting events is restricted to knights and nobles only, archery contests are usually open to all, including commoners and children. This makes them one of the very few means by which a commoner can come to the attention of powerful people - and even a modest cash prize is sure to generate lots of interest.": "虽然近战和比武的比赛只限于骑士和贵族，但射箭比赛通常对所有人开放，包括平民和儿童。这使得它们成为平民可以引起有权势的人注意的极少数手段之一--即使是适度的现金奖励也肯定会引起很多人的兴趣。",
	"Archery contests are usually organised as three-round elimination tournaments where archers are split into lines and the highest-scoring archer (sometimes the top two) from each line advances to one of two semi-finals. Then the winners of each semi-final face off one-on-one for the grand prize. In each round, the archers fire 6 arrows at a target 60ft away (though the range can vary - junior contests are usually shorter and grand finals often longer). Archers must use either shortbows or longbows; crossbows and other weapons are not allowed in archery contests.": "射箭比赛通常以三轮淘汰赛的形式进行，弓箭手被分成几行，每行得分最高的弓箭手（有时是前两名）进入两场半决赛中的一场。然后每场半决赛的获胜者一对一地对决，争夺大奖。在每一轮比赛中，弓箭手向60英尺外的目标发射6支箭（尽管射程可能有所不同 - 初级比赛通常较短，总决赛通常较长）。弓箭手必须使用短弓或长弓；弩和其他武器不允许用于射箭比赛。",
	"Points are scored according to the accuracy of the shot, determined by the archer's attack roll: 1 for white (AC 10), 2 for black (AC 12), 3 for blue (AC 14), 4 for red (AC 16), 5 for yellow (AC 18). When contests are held outdoors, there is a risk of sudden gusts of wind. The DM may therefore roll a d20 each round; all archers have disadvantage on their next shot if the result is a 20.": "分数是根据射击的准确性来决定的，由弓箭手的攻击卷决定。1为白色（AC 10），2为黑色（AC 12），3为蓝色（AC 14），4为红色（AC 16），5为黄色（AC 18）。当比赛在户外举行时，有可能会出现突然的大风。因此，DM可以在每一轮掷出一个D20；如果结果是20，所有的弓箭手在下一次射击时都有劣势。",
	"Some tourneys have a prize for the best-dressed lord or lady. This can get just as competitive as the jousting, and the rewards can be just as big - aside from the winner's pot of cash, this is also an excellent way to attract high-class suitors.": "一些巡回赛为穿得最漂亮的领主或夫人设置了奖项。这可能会像比武一样竞争激烈，奖励也同样丰厚--除了赢家的现金罐，这也是吸引高级求婚者的绝佳方式。",
	"Commoners, that is, anyone without a Scroll of Pedigree, will not be considered for this contest but, once one is in contention, anything goes. The winner should be determined by combining three numbers into a total score: a) the cost of their outfit in gp, up to a maximum of 50, b) a Charisma (Performance) check, to demonstrate how well they carried off their look and c) an Intelligence (History) check, to represent how well the contestant is following the current trends and fashions.": "平民，也就是没有血统卷轴的人，将不被考虑参加这次比赛，但是，一旦参加比赛，什么都可以。赢家应该由三个数字组合成一个总分来决定：a）他们的服装成本，以金币为单位，最高为50；b）魅力（表现）检查，以证明他们的造型有多好；c）智力（历史）检查，以代表参赛者对当前趋势和时尚的关注程度。",
	"No tourney would be complete without a lively betting market! Jousting, in particular, with its clear winners, quick results and frequent upsets is perfect for gambling. If a player wants to bet on a joust between two knights that are not equally matched, odds should be calculated as follows:": "如果没有活跃的博彩市场，任何巡回赛都是不完整的！尤其是比武，它有明确的赢家，快速的结果和频繁的颠覆。特别是比武，由于其明显的赢家，快速的结果和频繁的颠覆，非常适合于赌博。如果玩家想在两个不相上下的骑士之间的比武上下注，赔率应按以下方式计算。",
	"1. Compare the knights' strength modifier. For each point of difference, give the stronger knight 1 'edge point'.": "1. 比较骑士的力量修正值。每有一点差异，就给较强的骑士1个 \"边缘点\"。",
	"2. If one knight has the Mounted Combatant feat and the other doesn't, give the feat-holder 1 edge point.": "2. 如果一个骑士有骑兵特技，而另一个没有，给特技持有者1个优势点。",
	"3. If one knight has proficiency in Strength saves and the other doesn't, give the proficient knight 1 edge point.": "3. 如果一个骑士精通力量救赎而另一个没有，给精通的骑士1个优势点。",
	"4. Compare the edge point totals and note the difference. The one with more points is the favourite.": "4. 比较边缘的积分总数，并注意其差异。得分多的是最受欢迎的。",
	"5. The underdog's odds should be X:2, where X is equal to 2 plus 1 for the first edge point of difference plus 2 for each subsequent edge point.": "5. 劣势方的赔率应该是X:2，其中X等于2加1的第一个边缘点的差异，再加2的每个后续边缘点。",
	"6. The favourite's odds are the inverse of the underdog's.": "6. 喜爱者的赔率是劣势者的反比。",
	"Worked example: Knight A has a Strength score of 20, proficiency in Strength saves and the Mounted Combatant feat. Knight B has 16 Strength and neither of those things. Knight A therefore has 4 edge points over Knight B. Knight B's odds are therefore set at 9:2 and Knight A's odds are 2:9. If a player bet 9 gold and Knight A, who then went on to win, the player would receive 11 gold back from the bookmaker.": "实例。骑士A的力量值为20，熟练掌握力量救赎和骑兵特技。骑士B的力量值为16，这些都不是。因此，骑士A比骑士B有4个优势点，骑士B的赔率因此定为9：2，骑士A的赔率为2：9。如果玩家下注9个金币和骑士A，然后骑士A赢了，玩家将从庄家那里得到11个金币的回报。",
	"Note that this calculation does not produce precise odds, nor does it take into account smaller factors like differences in the knights' proficiency bonuses or Animal Handling scores. Calculating precise odds is mathematically complex and, more importantly, beyond the capabilities of the average NPC bookmaker.": "请注意，这种计算并不能产生精确的赔率，也没有考虑到较小的因素，如骑士的熟练度奖励或动物处理分数的差异。计算精确的赔率在数学上很复杂，更重要的是，超出了一般NPC赌徒的能力。",
	"When tourneys are held far away from the big cities, it is possible that large sections of the audience have never seen a wizard or bard in their lives. Therefore, it is not unusual for spellcasters to travel out to big tourneys in order to supplement their incomes. A PC with the ability to play an instrument or cast illusion spells can spend their time at the tourney entertaining crowds - and come home with a fistful of silver for their troubles. Performers can expect to earn an amount of gp equal to 1d8 + their Charisma modifier per hour, but spellcasters must expend one spell slot (of any level) for each hour of performance.": "当巡回赛在远离大城市的地方举行时，很大一部分观众有可能一辈子都没有见过巫师或吟游诗人。因此，施法者为了补充他们的收入而外出参加大型巡回赛的情况并不罕见。一个有能力演奏乐器或施展幻觉法术的人可以在巡回赛上花时间招待观众--然后带着一撮银子回家。表演者每小时可以赚取相当于1d8+他们的魅力修正值的金币，但施法者每小时的表演必须消耗一个法术槽（任何级别）。",

However, the sport sorely needed an update for 5th edition, so I've taken it upon myself to simplify the sport a little and convert it over.": "现在是我们谈论围攻球的时候了。每个战役世界的人都需要某种形式的娱乐消遣，当然除了杀怪和做任务之外。攻城球，一个我从/tg/偷来的概念（在这里阅读），是我在3.5版本的战役中的首选。它很有趣，很暴力，与各种角色相得益彰，并巧妙地利用了现有的游戏机制。然而，这项运动非常需要在第五版中进行更新，所以我决定将这项运动简化一下，并将其转换过来。",
	"Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls.": "攻城球是两队之间的游戏，每队五人。每队都有一座塔，以防御对方的攻击。然而，玩家不能直接攻击塔楼。相反，有一个球可以用来击倒塔楼。当一队的塔倒下时，他们就输了。",
	"The game is played in a walled rectangular arena. Normally, this arena is 140 feet long by 45 feet wide (28 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all sizes and shapes exist. Each team's tower, a 5-foot dimeter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set up 10 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise. Towers have 25 hit points and can only be damaged by the impact of the ball.": "比赛是在一个有墙的长方形竞技场进行的。通常情况下，这个竞技场长140英尺，宽45英尺（28个方块乘9个方块），尽管存在各种大小和形状的竞技场。每队的塔，是一个由木头或松散的石头制成的5英尺直径的柱子，从竞技场的两端纵向设置10英尺。塔有25个打击点，只能被球的冲击力损坏。",
	"Central to the game of siegeball is the ball, an especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking it. Though in some places, players strike the ball with their hands or fists, usually players are given bats (which use the statistics of a club), or even more powerful melee weapons, like warhammers and mauls.": "攻城球游戏的核心是球，这是一个特别密集的实心橡胶或包裹皮革的球体，由球员追赶。这个球重得惊人，球员通过攻击它来移动它。虽然在一些地方，球员用手或拳头击球，但通常球员都会得到球棒（使用俱乐部的统计数据），或更强大的近战武器，如战锤和槌子。",
	"The ball has an AC of 8 and a pool of Momentum Points, which determine how fast it's moving.": "该球的AC值为8，并有一个动量点，这决定了它的移动速度。",
	"{@b Attacking the Ball}. When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. On a hit, the ball gains a number of momentum points equal to half the damage dealt to it, rounded down. The ball moves five feet in the chosen direction for each momentum point it has. As it moves, the ball subtracts one momentum point for each five feet it moves until it stops.": "{@b Attacking the Ball}. 当你攻击球时，你可以选择在八个基本方向中的一个方向攻击它。击中后，球获得的动量点数等于它所受伤害的一半，向下取整。球在所选择的方向上移动五英尺，每一个动量点。在移动过程中，球每移动五英尺就会减去一个动量点，直到它停止。",
	"The ball can collide with wall, objects, or towers.": "球可以与墙壁、物体或塔楼相撞。",
	"{@b Colliding with a Wall}. If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops. Colliding with a Player. You can use your reaction to hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the ball's current momentum points, and send it in a new direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take damage equal to twice the ball's current momentum points and are knocked prone.": "{@b Colliding with a Wall}. 如果球与墙相撞，它会以与其方向相对应的角度弹开，并继续移动，直到停止。与球员相撞。如果球与你相撞，你可以用你的反应来打球。要做到这一点，请做一个针对球的攻击卷。在移动时，球有一个等于其当前动量点的AC的加成。一旦命中，就会像平常一样掷出伤害值，移除球的当前动量点，并将其送往一个新的方向。如果你没有击中，球会击中你，你会受到相当于球当前动量点两倍的伤害并被击倒。",
	"If you do not use your reaction to stop the ball, it rolls past you.": "如果你不利用你的反应来阻止球，它就会从你身边滚过。",
	"{@b Colliding with a Tower}. If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the twice the ball's current momentum points and then stops.": "{@b Colliding with a Tower}. 如果球与塔相撞，它对塔造成的伤害等于球当前动量点的两倍，然后停止。",
	"Playing the Game The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball. The player with the higher attack roll successfully attacks the ball. Players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball, but need not begin on their own side.": "比赛开始时，在场馆中心开球。每队的一名球员对球进行攻击卷。攻击卷数较高的球员成功攻击球。球员从距离球10英尺和30英尺范围内开始，但不需要从自己这边开始。",
	"Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the DM can choose for the teams to take turns acting, instead of keeping track of the players individually. The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hp.": "玩家按主动权顺序行动。如果愿意的话，管理员可以选择让各队轮流行动，而不是单独跟踪玩家。当一个塔被减少到0马力时，游戏结束。",
	"Siegeball is a widely-played sport and the exact rules and standards change wherever the game is played. The only concrete rule of Siegeball is not to attack your opponent's tower directly. In most arenas, using magic and attacking players directly are also considered cheating (though this doesn't stop some witches and wizards from influencing the games anyway). However, other behaviors, like shoving opposing players or kicking dirt into their eyes, is tolerated and sometimes even encouraged.": "攻城球是一项广泛开展的运动，无论在哪里进行比赛，确切的规则和标准都会改变。围攻球的唯一具体规则是不要直接攻击对手的塔。在大多数竞技场，使用魔法和直接攻击玩家也被认为是作弊（尽管这并不能阻止一些巫师和魔法师影响游戏）。然而，其他行为，如推搡对方球员或将泥土踢入他们的眼睛，是可以容忍的，有时甚至是鼓励的。",
	"In seedier games, Siegeball is a violent, high-stakes competition. with spellcasters on both sides attempting to secretly fix the game for their side, while the players try to disguise outright attacks on their opponents as legitimate maneuvers. Bets on Siegeball range from a few silver pieces to bags of gold, and games are particularly cut-throat when fortunes are on the line.": "在更多的游戏中，攻城球是一种暴力、高风险的竞争。双方的施法者都试图为自己一方暗中修复游戏，而玩家则试图将对对手的直接攻击伪装成合法的机动性。赌注从几块银币到几袋金子不等，当财富处于危险境地时，游戏就显得尤为残酷。",
	"In addition to attacking, dodging, shoving, and dashing, (and occasionally using an item forbidden by the referees), there are a few special actions that players of a siegeball game might take.": "除了攻击、躲避、推搡和冲撞，（偶尔也会使用裁判员禁止的物品），攻城球游戏的玩家还可能采取一些特殊行动。",
	"{@b Attack a Player (Illegally)}. In the most disreputable games, direct assaults on other players is not only allowed, it's encouraged. In most games, however, an attack can only be made when the referee isn't looking. When you make an attack on a creature in an arena that doesn't allow direct attacks, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. On a success, you attack the player without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.": "{@b Attack a Player (Illegally)}. 在最令人不齿的游戏中，直接攻击其他玩家不仅是允许的，而且是鼓励的。然而，在大多数游戏中，只有在裁判员不注意的时候才能进行攻击。当你在一个不允许直接攻击的竞技场中对一个生物进行攻击时，请进行灵巧（隐身）检查或魅力（欺骗）检查，由裁判员的被动感知得分来争夺。如果成功，你就会攻击该玩家而不会有任何后果。如果失败，你将在下一回合退出游戏，并在竞技场靠近你的塔的一侧重新进入游戏。",
	"Shove actions do not incur a penalty.": "推搡行为不会产生惩罚。",
	"{@b Block}. You dig in your heels and hold your ground. You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being moved against your will, and you can use your reaction to attack any ball that moves within 5 feet of you. Additionally, if the ball is within 5 feet of you, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against it.": "{@b Block}. 你紧紧抓住你的脚跟，坚守阵地。你在任何能力检查或蓄力投掷上都有优势，以抵制违背你意愿的移动，并且你可以使用你的反应来攻击任何在你5英尺范围内移动的球。此外，如果球在你的5英尺范围内，其他生物在对它进行攻击时有劣势。",
	"{@b Cast a Spell (Illegally)}. In very high society (especially elven society) certain types of more civilized magic might be allowed in siegeball games, but the vast majority of games, any arcana is paramount to cheating. When you cast a spell in an arena that doesn't allow magic, you can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. This roll has advantage if the target is within 5 feet of you, the effect of the spell doesn't include any large audio or visual cues (like certain illusion spells, or spells like gust of wind), or the spell is cast with the sorcerer's Subtle Spell Metamagic. It has disadvantage if the target of the spell is more than 5 feet away from you, or if the effect of the spell has obvious audio or visual effects. On a success, you cast the spell without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.": "{@b Cast a Spell (Illegally)}. 在非常高的社会中（尤其是精灵社会），某些类型的更文明的魔法可能在攻城球游戏中被允许，但绝大多数的游戏，任何奥术都是最重要的作弊手段。当你在一个不允许使用魔法的竞技场中施法时，你可以做一个灵巧（隐身）检查或魅力（欺骗）检查，由裁判员的被动感知得分来竞争。如果目标在你的5英尺范围内，法术的效果不包括任何大型的声音或视觉提示（比如某些幻觉法术，或者像阵风这样的法术），或者该法术是用巫师的微妙法术Metamagic施放的，那么该卷就有优势。如果法术的目标离你超过5英尺，或者法术的效果有明显的音频或视觉效果，那么它就有劣势。成功时，你施展该法术而不产生任何后果。失败时，你将在下一回合退出游戏，并在竞技场靠近你的塔的一侧重新进入游戏。",
	"Inborn magical abilities like a dragonborn's Breath Weapon may or may not count as magic, at the referee's discretion.": "天生的魔法能力，如龙裔的呼吸武器，可以算作魔法，也可以不算，由裁判员决定。",
	"{@b Follow}. When you take this action, choose a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. When that creature moves, you attempt to follow behind it, moving up to your base speed, while remaining the same distance between yourself and the lead creature for the entire duration of the movement.": "{@b Follow}. 当你采取这个行动时，选择一个你能看到的在你10英尺范围内的生物。当那个生物移动时，你试图跟在它后面，以你的基本速度移动，同时在整个移动过程中，你和领先的生物之间保持相同的距离。",
	"{@b Retire}. When you take this action, you remove yourself from the field and sit out the rest of the game. This may be useful to free yourself from danger, but you can no longer help your team.": "{@b Retire}. 当你采取这一行动时，你会把自己从场上移开，并在剩下的比赛中缺席。这对使自己摆脱危险可能是有用的，但你不能再帮助你的球队。",
	"{@b Tackle}. Performing a tackle is a special variant of shoving a creature. You have advantage on a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). On a success, you and the target are knocked prone in the target's space.": "{@b Tackle}. 执行擒拿是推搡生物的一个特殊变体。你在由目标的力量（竞技）或灵巧（杂技）检定（由目标选择使用的能力）所争夺的力量（竞技）检定中具有优势。如果成功，你和目标都会被击倒在目标的空间里。",
	"Different siegeball arenas impose different restrictions on the games they hold, ranging from so-called underground arenas, where blood is more important than sport, to the mainstream arenas, which are funded by kings or other nobility, and thus impose fairly civilized rules.": "不同的攻城球赛场对他们举行的比赛有不同的限制，从所谓的地下赛场，血液比运动更重要，到主流赛场，由国王或其他贵族资助，因此实行相当文明的规则。",
	"The following are some of restrictions that an arena might impose on the game:": "以下是一个竞技场可能对游戏施加的一些限制。",
	"{@b Everything Goes}. Magic, deadly weapons, direct attacks on players, and even murder is all allowed in this game. Arenas that play with these rules are typically deemed Blood Arenas by spectators, and their players (which are paid handsomely for surviving) are more like gladiators than professional athletes. Expect these arenas in drow cities, and other evil locales.": "{@b Everything Goes}. 在这个游戏中，魔法、致命武器、直接攻击玩家，甚至谋杀都是允许的。遵循这些规则的竞技场通常被观众认为是血腥竞技场，他们的选手（为生存而获得丰厚的报酬）更像是角斗士而不是职业运动员。预计这些竞技场将出现在鸦人城市和其他邪恶的地方。",
	"{@b Everything Goes (Limited)}. Magic and direct attacks on other players are allowed, but only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed, and outright murder disqualifies a team. These rules are typically held in run-down arenas in less prosperous cities (where new siegeball teams might just get their start.)": "{@b Everything Goes (Limited)}. 允许使用魔法和直接攻击其他玩家，但只允许使用常规的攻城球武器，而直接谋杀会取消球队的资格。这些规则通常在不太繁荣的城市的破旧竞技场举行（新的攻城球队可能只是在那里起步。）",
	"{@b All Weapons}. Weapons of any variety can be used in this game, up to and including massive warhammers and greatswords, but no magic of any sort is allowed. Towers have twice the HP in this game. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.": "{@b All Weapons}. 本游戏中可以使用任何种类的武器，包括大型战锤和大剑，但不允许使用任何种类的魔法。在这个游戏中，塔楼的HP是两倍。对其他玩家的攻击和非法的魔法都会受到惩罚，将违规的玩家赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个队伍被取消资格。",
	"This variant of the rules is similar to the conventional rules, but allows for spectacular and dangerous weapons (and, of course, more deadly \"accidents\"). Particularly ravenous crowds flock to these games for the fleeting chance of watching blood being spilled.": "这种规则的变体与传统规则相似，但允许使用壮观和危险的武器（当然还有更致命的 \"事故\"）。特别是贪婪的人群涌向这些游戏，因为有转瞬即逝的机会可以看到血流成河。",
	"{@b Limited Magic}. Some spells, specifically those which do not directly deal damage to members of the other team, are allowed and allowed. At least one player on each team is encouraged to know the spells dispel magic and counterspell. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team. Teleporting another player mid-game across the continent, however, is allowed.": "{@b Limited Magic}. 一些法术，特别是那些不直接对另一队成员造成伤害的法术，是允许的，也是被允许的。我们鼓励每队至少有一名队员知道驱散魔法和反魔法的法术。对其他队员的攻击和非法的魔法会受到惩罚，将违规的队员赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个队伍将被取消资格。然而，在比赛中把另一名球员传送到大陆另一边是允许的。",
	"These rules are more common where magic is viewed more favorably as a civilized art, rather than as the trickery of elves and witches. Though the spectators might seem more refined at first glance, they are just as ravenous for the blood and conflict of a good siegeball game.": "这些规则在魔法被视为文明艺术而非精灵和巫师的诡计时更为常见。虽然观众乍看之下可能更高雅，但他们也同样渴望一场精彩的攻城球比赛的血腥和冲突。",
	"{@b Conventional}. Only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed in this game, and all magic is disallowed. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.": "{@b Conventional}. 在这个游戏中只允许使用传统的攻城球武器，所有的魔法都是不允许的。对其他球员的攻击和非法的魔法将受到惩罚，即把违规的球员赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个球队将被取消资格。",
	"This is the dominant system of rules for the game, practiced in the most prominent siegeball arenas.": "这是游戏规则的主导系统，在最著名的围攻赛场上实行。",
	"Though individual, one-off siegeball games are held regularly, there's nothing so spectacular as a tournament: the thrill of rising to the top, the sting of defeat, and the lure of a grand prize and lasting glory. Few other things bring out spectators and players alike in droves. The grandeur of such tournaments is integral to siegeball on a grand scale, as they bring far-flung teams together, expand the sport's scope to a national scale, and unite players and spectators in a single, [grand] competition.": "虽然个人的、一次性的攻城球比赛经常举行，但没有什么比锦标赛更壮观的了：登顶的快感，失败的刺痛，以及大奖和持久荣誉的诱惑。很少有其他事情能让观众和球员成群结队地参加。这类锦标赛的宏大规模是围攻棒球不可或缺的，因为它们将遥远的队伍聚集在一起，将这项运动的范围扩大到全国范围，并将球员和观众团结在一个单一的[盛大]比赛中。",
	"Though tournaments are the lifeblood of career siegeball teams, there exists no one perfect way of conducting them. Each method of arranging a tournament has radical pros and cons, though most attempt to strike a balance between audience tension and accurate assessment of skill. The following tournament designs are often used for siegeball:": "虽然比赛是职业围攻队的生命线，但没有一种完美的方式来进行比赛。每种安排比赛的方法都有激进的优点和缺点，尽管大多数人都试图在观众的紧张感和对技能的准确评估之间取得平衡。以下是经常用于围棋的锦标赛设计。",
	" By far the simplest and shortest tournament is the singleelimination bracket. In this tournament, teams are randomly paired off on a pyramid, and losers are eliminated from the tournament. Winners advance to the next round until only one team remains.": " 到目前为止，最简单和最短的比赛是单淘汰赛。在这种比赛中，各队在金字塔上随机配对，失败者被淘汰出局。胜者进入下一轮，直到只剩下一支队伍。",
	"Though this tournament's design is attractive due to its simplicity, it suffers from some limitations. When spectators follow only a single team, they are unlikely to return after their team is eliminated; a result that is extremely likely when half of the competing teams are eliminated every round. Also, skilled teams can be eliminated early after only a single bad match, leading to upsets where the players blame the loss of an entire tournament on a single bad play or referee call.": "尽管这项比赛的设计因其简单而具有吸引力，但它也有一些局限性。当观众只关注一支球队时，他们不太可能在自己的球队被淘汰后再回来；当每轮都有一半的竞争球队被淘汰时，这种结果是极其可能的。另外，有技术的球队可能只在一场糟糕的比赛后就被提前淘汰，从而导致颠覆，即球员将整个比赛的损失归咎于一次糟糕的比赛或裁判的判罚。",
	"Despite its drawbacks, single elimination tournaments remain the favorite among orcish and goblinoid teams, perhaps because it doesn't hinder a tournament's progression if a half of a losing team is killed over the course of a game.": "尽管有缺点，单淘汰赛仍然是兽人和地精队伍的最爱，也许是因为在比赛过程中，如果输掉的队伍中有一半人被杀，也不会妨碍比赛的进程。",
	"A popular alternative to the single elimination tournament is the double elimination. This bracket proceeds like the single elimination bracket, except that losers are added to a loser's bracket, where they compete against each other. The final team remaining in the loser's bracket goes on to play the victor of the winner's bracket in the finals. This design ensures that teams play at least two games each, and that a single poor game doesn't condemn an otherwise superlative team.": "单淘汰赛的一个流行替代方案是双淘汰赛。这种比赛的过程与单淘汰赛类似，只是输家被加入到败者组，在那里他们互相竞争。最后留在败者组的球队在决赛中与胜者组的胜利者比赛。这种设计确保了各队至少各打两场比赛，而且一场糟糕的比赛也不会使一个原本优秀的球队受到谴责。",
	"A natural extension to the double elimination design, multilevel tournaments begin with all contending teams at the same \"level\", with a tournament score equal to the number of contending teams. A team gains one point on a victory, and loses one point on a defeat, and plays only other teams with the same tournament score as themselves, continuing until no two teams are on the same level (or until only one team is the victor, depending on the specific rules.) This design ensures that competitors play a roughly equal number of games, and that a maximum number of competitions happen at one time. Additionally, it's likely that teams will be more evenly matched for skill after a few rounds.": "作为双败淘汰赛设计的自然延伸，多级比赛开始时，所有参赛队都处于同一 \"级别\"，比赛得分与参赛队的数量相等。一支球队在胜利时获得一分，在失败时失去一分，并且只和其他与自己有相同比赛分数的球队比赛，一直到没有两支球队处于同一水平（或只有一支球队是胜利者，取决于具体规则）。此外，在几轮比赛之后，各队的技术可能会更加均衡。",
	"In a round-robin game, each competing team plays each other in sequence; the team with the greatest number of victories wins, or goes to a tie-breaker game. This is easily the fairest way of determining a victor, since every possible matchup in a tournament is played out, but it has yet to catch on in the national siegeball stage. Part of the reason might be that players are accustomed to the thrill of elimination, and the natural progression of more skilled teams matching against one another as the brackets become smaller. Whatever the reason, few leagues (except for elven leagues) employ this type of tournament.": "在循环赛中，各参赛队依次进行比赛；胜利次数多的队伍获胜，或进入决胜局。这是确定胜利者的最公平的方法，因为锦标赛中每一个可能的对决都会进行，但它还没有在国家围棋舞台上流行起来。部分原因可能是球员们已经习惯了淘汰赛的刺激，以及随着赛程的缩小，技术更高的球队自然会相互竞争。不管是什么原因，很少有联赛（除了精灵族联赛）采用这种类型的比赛。",
	"The annual Siegeball Championship League, held for the better part of a millennium, enjoys the largest scale and most prestigious prizes of any siegeball tournament. Taking part over a season, its athletes travel from city to city, competing in matches to separate the wheat from the chaff.": "一年一度的围棋冠军联赛，已经举办了一千年之久，是所有围棋比赛中规模最大、奖金最高的比赛。在一个赛季中，运动员们从一个城市到另一个城市，在比赛中分出高下。",
	"At its conclusion, only one team may win the Siegebowl, and claim its grand prize (normally an impressive quantity of gold). Perhaps more importantly, Championship victors claim legendary sports status for all time, and are enshrined in the Hall of Victors, an immortal dedication to champions throughout the ages.": "在比赛结束时，只有一支球队可以赢得围棋比赛，并获得其大奖（通常是数量惊人的黄金）。也许更重要的是，锦标赛的胜利者将获得永远的传奇体育地位，并被载入胜利者大厅，这是对历代冠军的不朽献礼。",
	"The Championship is a double-elimination competition, and every competing team must play one home game and one away game. Contending teams are selected by the Championship Committee, the presiding board of regulators and referees, and also must pay a hefty entry fee to compete. Though entry fees might pose an obstacle for upstart teams, they rarely present an obstacle to national contenders, which compete yearly.": "锦标赛是一项双淘汰赛，每支参赛队必须进行一场主场比赛和一场客场比赛。参赛队伍由锦标赛委员会、监管机构和裁判的主持委员会挑选，同时必须支付高昂的参赛费。虽然报名费可能会对新晋球队构成障碍，但对于每年都参加比赛的全国性竞争者来说，它们很少构成障碍。",
	"Few games are played exclusively for bragging rights and notoriety; tournaments run on their prizes. Large, enticing awards for winning teams fuels an entire industry of talent scouts, coaches, and arena owners, from the smallest games to the largest championships. Every player dreams of glory, but earning huge prize is a close second.": "很少有游戏是完全为了炫耀权利和臭名昭著而进行的；锦标赛是靠奖金运行的。从最小的比赛到最大的冠军赛，为获胜队伍提供的大量诱人的奖励助长了整个行业的星探、教练和场馆业主。每个球员都梦想着荣誉，但赚取巨额奖金是紧随其后的。",
	"Of course, not all prizes are silver and gold. Siegeball tournaments give out a huge variety of prizes, some of which are detailed here:": "当然，不是所有的奖品都是金银财宝。Siegeball锦标赛发放的奖品种类繁多，这里详细介绍了其中的一些奖品。",
	"Most large, official tournament tournaments give out a trophy of some variety to the winning team. The classic trophy is a gold chalice with a marble base, engraved with the tournament's name and year. Other might include medals, rings, or ribbons, depending on the tournament. The best of teams collect these trophies and display them as badges of honor, but ultimately, they're fairly token. Nearly every trophy is awarded alongside a cash prize, which coaches and team owners view as far more substantial.": "大多数大型的官方锦标赛都会向获胜的队伍颁发某种形式的奖杯。经典的奖杯是一个带有大理石底座的金杯，上面刻有比赛的名称和年份。其他的可能包括奖牌、戒指或丝带，这取决于比赛的情况。最好的团队会收集这些奖杯，并将其作为荣誉徽章展示，但最终，它们是相当象征性的。几乎每个奖杯都是和现金奖一起颁发的，教练和球队老板认为现金奖更有意义。",
	"The actual value of cash prizes might vary, but they generally grow (exceptionally, in fact) with the glamor and prestige of the tournament awarding them. Typical first-place prizes are listed on the cash prizes table below. Often, a second-place prize equal to half the value of the first-place prize is awarded to the runner up team.": "现金奖的实际价值可能会有所不同，但它们通常会随着颁发现金奖的锦标赛的魅力和声望而增长（事实上是异常的）。典型的第一名的奖金列在下面的现金奖表中。通常情况下，第二名的奖金相当于第一名奖金的一半，颁发给亚军队伍。",
	"Other valuable items, equivalent in value to cash prize, might be awarded instead. Anything from magic items, to priceless treasures donated from the king's coffers, to entire keeps or tracks of land could be at stake for the winning team. It is assumed that such prizes will probably be sold (at least in part, if the prize in question can be divided) to pay the team, the coach, and the arena owner sponsoring the team. Other items, like artifacts, might be powerful enough that the fate of many innocents might rely on the winner of the tournament. Though such awards might seem extremely foolhardy, they're not uncommon among the elves, who appreciate the dramatics.": "其他有价值的物品，相当于现金奖励的价值，也可能被授予。从魔法物品，到国王国库中捐赠的无价之宝，再到整个庄园或土地，都可能成为获胜队伍的赌注。我们认为，这些奖品可能会被出售（至少部分出售，如果有关奖品可以分割），以支付球队、教练和赞助球队的竞技场所有者。其他项目，如神器，可能足够强大，许多无辜者的命运可能取决于比赛的获胜者。虽然这样的奖励可能看起来非常愚蠢，但在精灵中并不罕见，他们欣赏这种戏剧性。",
	"One of the more obvious uses for a siegeball tournament is as a wrapper for an entire campaign, as the two match exceedingly well. Campaigns involving siegeball feel very different depending on the party's level, adopting different themes, goals, and villains as the party progresses. This section will cover three different types of siegeball tournament campaigns:": "攻城球比赛的一个更明显的用途是作为整个战役的包装，因为这两者非常匹配。涉及攻城球的战役感觉非常不同，这取决于党派的级别，随着党派的发展，采用不同的主题、目标和反派人物。本节将介绍三种不同类型的攻城球比赛活动。",
	"Before 5th level, siegeball campaigns are bound to be gritty affairs of underground tournaments taking place in dangerous arenas. Until the party achieves enough notoriety to be noticed by a siegeball scout, every day is a struggle for survival. Brutal enemy teams leave them battered and bruised after every game, and lethal weapons like warhammers are brought in regularly. Each game risks life and death, in addition to lifechanging glory.": "在5级之前，攻城球运动必然是在危险的竞技场上进行的地下比赛的狡猾事务。在党派取得足够的声望以被攻城球侦察员注意之前，每天都是为生存而斗争。残酷的敌方队伍在每场比赛后都会让他们遍体鳞伤，而像战锤这样的致命武器也会定期被送来。每场比赛除了改变生命的荣耀外，还有生死的风险。",
	"The party's coach (or owner, as the case may be) will likely be an antagonist in this type of campaign, acting as a driving force to push the party toward ever more dangerous games, while paying them as little as possible, and making escape impossible. The coach is more obsessed with money than safety, and may even place bets against the party in their most perilous games.": "党的教练（或老板，视情况而定）很可能在这种类型的活动中成为对手，作为一种推动力，将党推向越来越危险的游戏，同时尽可能少地支付他们，并使他们无法逃脱。教练对金钱比对安全更着迷，甚至可能在他们最危险的游戏中对他们下注。",
	"The competitors at this level are a combination of the underprivileged athletes with big dreams and criminally violent players that could never advance higher in the game, due to their contempt for authority. A team made exclusive of this latter group might not fare well against the party in winning a game of siegeball, but could easily kill one of them mid-game.": "这个级别的竞争者是拥有伟大梦想的贫困运动员和犯罪暴力的球员的组合，由于他们对权威的蔑视，他们永远不可能在游戏中获得更高的地位。由这后一组人组成的队伍在赢得围攻球比赛时可能不会有好的结果，但在比赛中可以轻易地杀死他们中的一个。",
	"When the party finally attains a modicum of success in the underground siegeball arenas, they'll likely be spotted by a siegeball recruiter for a medium or large city and be signed on a long-term contract. Right away, they'll be gifted new uniforms and equipment, and will be placed in a tournament against vastly more professional teams. With enough skill and daring, the party might rise to the top of their first professional siegeball tournament to become the underdogs with a shot at the top.": "当当事人最终在地下围攻赛场上取得一定的成功时，他们很可能会被一个大中型城市的围攻赛招募者看中，并与之签订长期合同。马上，他们就会得到新的制服和设备，并被安排与更多的专业队伍进行比赛。如果有足够的技巧和胆量，他们可能会在第一次职业攻城球比赛中脱颖而出，成为有机会登顶的弱者。",
	"Traveling from city to city for siegeball games gives the party a chance to explore the campaign world, and opens up possibilities for roadside encounters and diversions from the main tournament. Any distraction that seriously injures a party member or delays the party from reaching the stadium in time could endanger their careers as well, so even sidequests have a measure of potential risk.": "从一个城市到另一个城市参加攻城球比赛，使党有机会探索战役世界，并为路边的遭遇和主要比赛的转移提供了可能性。任何严重伤害党员或拖延党员及时到达体育场的分心行为都可能危及他们的职业生涯，所以即使是副业也有一定的潜在风险。",
	"At this level of the campaign, the ruthlessly competitive opposing teams will rise to become the chief antagonists. This is a great place to insert an experienced rival team who are favored to win the tournament as a foil to the party's underdog standing. Other interesting teams with strong gimmicks are key to pad out the tournament before the final game.": "在这个级别的活动中，竞争无情的对手球队将上升为主要的对立面。这是一个很好的地方，可以插入一个有经验的对手球队，他们被认为可以赢得比赛，作为党的弱势地位的陪衬。其他具有强大噱头的有趣团队是在最后一场比赛前垫定比赛的关键。",
	"Of course, it's possible that the party might find interesting offers coming in from private siegeball arrangements, where 'no rules' games are played behind closed doors for a selected audience. These games are clearly unsafe, and those arranging them seem very suspect, but the lavish pay is enticing nonetheless.": "当然，党可能会发现来自私人围棋安排的有趣提议，在那里，\"没有规则 \"的游戏是闭门为选定的观众进行的。这些游戏显然是不安全的，而且安排这些游戏的人似乎非常可疑，但奢华的报酬还是很诱人。",
	"Lastly, this period of the campaign sees the party achieving their first real fame: they'll be recognized on the street and be asked to sign autographs by die-hard siegeball fans. They're not going to be mobbed by the adoring public quite yet, but this might nonetheless go to their heads.": "最后，在活动的这段时间里，该党首次获得了真正的名声：他们会在街上被认出，并被死忠的围攻者要求签名。他们还不会被崇拜的公众围攻，但这可能会影响到他们的想法。",

	"Additionally, the Championship tends to attract contenders from much further afield, including a host of non-humanoid teams. Teams of djinni and efreeti travel from the Elemental Planes to compete, and a team of driders always rises from to represent the underworld in the competition.

	"Between games is a long, nervous period of practice matches, punctuated by intrigue. Large conspiracies surround the Championship, from hazardous, illegal drugs being taken by other players to enhance their speed and strength, to sinister donors that have entered new teams in the tournament for mysterious reasons, to plots to sabotage the party's chances of victory. If the party wants any chance of winning, investigating and exposing these schemes is critical.": "比赛之间是一段漫长而紧张的练习赛，其间夹杂着阴谋。巨大的阴谋围绕着锦标赛，从其他球员服用危险的非法药物以提高他们的速度和力量，到阴险的捐助者出于神秘的原因在锦标赛中加入新的队伍，到破坏党的胜利机会的阴谋。如果该党想获得任何胜利的机会，调查和揭露这些阴谋是至关重要的。",
	"At this stage of the campaign, the party can be considered superstars. Ordinary people get starstruck around them (even those who don't follow siegeball), and they find it hard to push through crowds before games.

The attacking player may choose which part of the wall it hits, as long as he has a pawn directly in front of it. On his turn, the defending player makes the same roll, but can use the score to repair a piece of the wall. Once a breach in the wall has been made, each player can choose (on their turn) to move one pawn to the other side of the board, by rolling the die.

She recently set up shop, and for the bargain price of 10gp you can have a five-minute conversation with her. As you reach her table, she asks for your name and gestures you to place your coins onto a silver plate. You are instantly overwhelmed by her perfume: incense and myrrh. She pulls out a velvet bag of charmed runestones and shakes them in a cup. She instructs you to think of a question that can be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\".

	"Cackleball is played with a severed goblin head. Before play, the umpire casts {@spell speak with dead} (or {@spell magic mouth}) on the head, causing it to cackle manically during the game. The objective of the sport is to outscore the opposing team by defending the head while it rests atop a small pyramid shaped mound within your own half of the field. Each beat of the drum - roughtly every second - score the team a point. Getting the head to pronounce you the winner is worth a significant 20 points.

	"A collection of amusement shows and activities, often of the transient variety. A travelling carnival moves from location to location, setting up in a new place for a few days or a few weeks. Often, carnivals strike deals with towns and cities in order to set up carnivals during locally recognized celebrations or holidays. Carnivals often include food and merchandise vendors, games of luck, competitions of skill, and acts by humanoid or animal performers.": "一系列的娱乐节目和活动，通常是临时性的。巡回嘉年华会从一个地方移动到另一个地方，在一个新的地方设立几天或几周的时间。通常，嘉年华会与城镇达成协议，以便在当地公认的庆祝活动或节日期间举办嘉年华会。狂欢节通常包括食品和商品供应商、运气游戏、技能竞赛以及人形或动物表演者的表演。",
	"A circus is focused on a performance within a large tent, rather than a variety of tents and booths. Sometimes a part of a carnival, and sometimes an independent act, a circus features performances by humanoids and animals in a wide variety of forms. Though a circus may set up and perform for several days or even weeks, they will have scheduled shows rather than nonstop entertainment.": "马戏团的重点是在一个大帐篷内的表演，而不是各种帐篷和摊位。马戏团有时是狂欢节的一部分，有时是独立的行为，其特点是由人类和动物以各种各样的形式进行表演。尽管一个马戏团可能会在几天甚至几周的时间里进行表演，但他们会有预定的节目，而不是不停地进行娱乐。",
	"Unlike a carnival or circus, a fair is usually put together by the local population of a town or city without contracting outside performers. As such, it will take on a much more \"homey\" feel, focusing on agriculture, animal husbandry, and local crafts and talents.": "与嘉年华会或马戏团不同，集市通常是由一个城镇的当地居民举办的，没有与外部表演者签约。因此，它将呈现出更多的 \"家庭 \"感觉，侧重于农业、畜牧业以及当地的手工艺和人才。",
	"A large meal or banquet held on a holiday in celebration. Though not every group of people has the economic freedom to throw a banquet, \"feasting\" for some could simply mean a communal meal or a special dish associated with the holiday. In some parlance, a \"feast day\" may not even involve food, and instead is related more closely to the term festival.": "在某个节日举行的大餐或宴会，以示庆祝。虽然不是每一群人都有举办宴会的经济自由，但对一些人来说，\"盛宴 \"可能仅仅意味着集体用餐或与节日有关的特殊菜肴。在一些说法中，\"盛宴日 \"甚至可能不涉及食物，而是与节日这个词更密切相关。",
	"A communal celebration. Not strictly limited to holidays, festivals may also be held to celebrate events such as the birth of a royal heir, the changing of seasons, troops returning home from war, or the homecoming of a famed local figure after a journey.": "一个集体的庆祝活动。严格来说，节日并不局限于节假日，也可以为庆祝一些事件而举行，如皇室继承人的出生、季节的变化、军队从战争中归来，或当地著名人物在旅行后的归来。",
	"Derived from the term \"holy day\", a holiday is any day or period of time in which most people are released from work obligations. Holidays need not always have a religious background, and may be of secular nature, or held in remembrance of historical events or mortal figures. Feel free to mix-and-match the materials in this book. A local agricultural fair could still host a fun house, set up by the local craftsmen. A circus might still host a strongman contest, to entertain their audience outside of the tent before the show lets in. A holiday celebration might hold a drinking contest or a pie eating contest as part of the practice of communal feasting. If you're the one designing your celebrations, then there are no limits to them.": "节日源于 \"圣日 \"一词，是大多数人免除工作义务的任何一天或一段时期。节日不一定都有宗教背景，可以是世俗性质的，也可以是为纪念历史事件或凡人而举行的。请自由搭配本书中的材料。当地的农业博览会仍然可以举办一个由当地工匠搭建的游乐场。马戏团可能仍然会举办壮士比赛，在演出开始前在帐篷外为观众提供娱乐。节日庆祝活动可能会举办饮酒比赛或吃馅饼比赛，作为公共宴席做法的一部分。如果你是设计你的庆祝活动的人，那么它们就没有限制。",
	"There are no limits on scale. You could run a city-wide carnival in a metropolis like Waterdeep, with entire streets dedicated to festivities. You could also create a holiday celebrated only in a small town (Chapter 10, Designing Custom Holidays). You might also simply set up a roadside tent with a fortune teller, to provide a touch of foreshadowing to your party, and give them some guidance to get their meandering back on track (Chapter 6, Visiting The Fortune Teller). While this guide is primarily written with the Dungeon Master in mind, there are useful player resources to be had within. Chapter 9 focuses on backgrounds, allowing DMs and players alike to construct characters who have lived their lives embedded in the culture of carnivals, circuses, and performing.": "在规模上没有限制。你可以在Waterdeep这样的大都市举办全城的狂欢节，整个街道都是节日。你也可以创造一个只在小镇上庆祝的节日（第十章，设计自定义节日）。你也可以简单地在路边搭一个帐篷，里面有一个算命先生，为你的队伍提供一丝预示，并给他们一些指导，让他们的游荡回到正轨（第6章，拜访算命先生）。虽然本指南主要是以地下城主为中心编写的，但其中也有一些有用的玩家资源。第9章侧重于背景，让管理员和玩家都能构建那些生活在狂欢节、马戏团和表演文化中的角色。",

	"Adventurers live very unique lives, in that they have more opportunities to travel and visit new lands than average folk.

	"Many circus performances throughout history have relied on the exhibition of \"freaks\", or rather, people with unusual appearances. Often, this included people who were exceptionally tall or exceptionally short, fat people, people of different ethnicities, or people who suffered some sort of physical deformity. As modern sensitivities have developed, we've accepted that this can be a very harmful mistreatment of people who suffer from disability or deformity, and the practice of paying to view a \"freak\" contributed to their dehumanization.": "历史上许多马戏团的表演都依赖于 \"怪人 \"的展示，或者说，具有不寻常外表的人。通常，这包括特别高或特别矮的人、胖子、不同种族的人，或遭受某种身体畸形的人。随着现代敏感性的发展，我们已经接受，这可能是对患有残疾或畸形的人非常有害的虐待，而付费观看 \"怪胎 \"的做法促成了他们的非人化。",
	"If you want to keep your carnival setting tasteful, try to avoid classic characters like \"the fat lady\", \"the giant\", \"conjoined twins\" or \"the bearded lady\" (who may not even be out of the ordinary depending on how your setting handles dwarven physiology). Instead focus on performers who actively do things, or capitalize on an appearance that they chose for themselves, such as extreme body modification. Giving a person agency in their lives can make a big difference in the way they are portrayed.": "如果你想让你的狂欢节设置保持品味，尽量避免像 \"胖女人\"、\"巨人\"、\"连体婴儿 \"或 \"大胡子女人 \"这样的经典角色（根据你的设置如何处理矮人的生理结构，他们甚至可能并不出格）。相反，要关注那些积极做事的表演者，或者利用他们为自己选择的外表，例如极端的身体改造。赋予一个人在生活中的代理权可以使他们的形象大为改观。",
	"From tightrope walking, to tumbling, to trapeze, and any other variety of dextrous bodily performance, acrobats steal the show. The earliest recorded performances involved acrobats performing feats of limberness and balance while riding on the backs of bulls, or balancing on their hands while firing bows and arrows with their feet. Today, ingenuity and creativity have lead to acrobats performing on rings, ropes, or swaths of silk suspended from ceilings, tree limbs, and tent posts, high above the heads of an awe-struck audience.": "从走钢丝到翻跟头，再到空中飞人，以及其他各种灵活的身体表演，杂技演员抢尽了风头。最早的表演记录涉及杂技演员在骑在公牛背上时进行的柔韧和平衡的表演，或在用脚发射弓箭时用手保持平衡。今天，独创性和创造性已经导致杂技演员在天花板、树枝和帐篷柱上悬挂的吊环、绳索或丝绸上进行表演，高高在上，令观众惊叹不已。",
	"The best performers are the ones the onlookers don't realize are putting on a show. Carnies, or \"showies\" as some may call them, are responsible for setting up equipment, running games, vending food and toys, and every other requirement of making the carnival actually work. They may make themselves obvious by calling passersbys to try their hand at games or competitions, or keep themselves scarce when setting up equipment, props, and decor for upcoming performances. Carnies are the backbone of the carnival, and are also a playable background (see pg. 22).": "最好的表演者是那些旁观者没有意识到在表演的人。卡尼们，或者有些人称他们为 \"表演者\"，负责设置设备、运行游戏、出售食物和玩具，以及使嘉年华会实际运作的所有其他要求。他们可能会通过召集路人参加游戏或比赛来显露自己的身份，或者在为即将到来的表演设置设备、道具和装饰时保持沉默。车夫是嘉年华会的骨干，也是一个可玩的背景（见第22页）。",
	"Though perhaps not as eye-catching as many of the other performers, the ringmaster has an extremely important duty. Functioning as the \"master of ceremonies\", they are essentially using their charisma to pull off a massive feat of \"sleight of hand\". Though a performance may come across as snappy or explosive, most performances require some degree of setup to perform properly and safely. Thus, the ringmaster guides the audience's attention away from a trick being set up or broken down, and toward a new highlight of entertainment.": "虽然可能不像其他许多表演者那样引人注目，但司仪有一个极其重要的职责。作为 \"司仪\"，他们基本上是利用自己的魅力来完成一个巨大的 \"魔术 \"壮举。虽然一个表演可能会表现得很爽快或很有爆发力，但大多数表演都需要一定程度的设置才能正常和安全地进行。因此，司仪将观众的注意力从正在设置或分解的魔术上转移到新的娱乐亮点上。",
	"While acrobats and gymnasts may perform feats that require flexibility, a contortionist specializes in being able to twist their body into knots. Most contortionists specialize in frontbending or back-bending, and some may also practice displays of contorting to fit within small spaces (like a box or trunk), or dislocating joints (\"bone-breaking\" to the uninformed).": "杂技演员和体操运动员可能会表演需要柔韧性的节目，而柔术师的专长是能够将身体扭曲成结。大多数柔术师擅长前弯或后弯，有些人还可能练习在狭小的空间（如箱子或树干）内扭曲身体，或使关节脱臼（不知情的人称之为 \"断骨\"）的展示。",
	"In a world where \"breathing fire\" is relegated to the realms of Dragonborn or magic (Potion of Fire Breath, DMG pg. 187), fire breathers and fire eaters must draw particular attention to the fact that they utilize no magic in the performing of their arts. Furthermore, while a Dragonborn may utilize breath weapons, even a fire-breathing sort is not immune to fire, making the supposed \"eating\" of flame still impressive. In reality, what they do requires very little special equipment, but instead a great deal of practice and a slightly more advanced knowledge of the sciences than most people (IE \"heat rises\", \"fire requires oxygen\", and so on).": "在这个世界上，\"喷火 \"被归为龙族或魔法的范畴（喷火药水，DMG第187页），喷火者和吃火者必须特别注意他们在表演他们的艺术时没有利用魔法。此外，虽然龙裔可以使用呼吸武器，但即使是喷火者也不能对火免疫，这使得所谓的 \"吃 \"火焰仍然令人印象深刻。实际上，他们所做的事情几乎不需要什么特殊的设备，而是需要大量的练习和比大多数人略微高级的科学知识（IE \"热量上升\"，\"火需要氧气\"，等等）。",
	"Generally speaking, a magician by themselves is not going to be particularly interesting in most settings. Unless you're working from a \"low magic\" setting in which common folk know of the existence of magic and yet rarely ever see it, your magicians will either have to pull off extraordinary feats, or appear to break known laws of magic.": "一般来说，在大多数情况下，魔术师本身不会特别有趣。除非你是在一个 \"低魔法 \"的环境中工作，普通人知道魔法的存在，但却很少看到它，否则你的魔术师要么必须完成非凡的壮举，要么看起来要打破已知的魔法规律。",
	"Shabbily dressed performers who carry on simple plays. The most classic play revolves around two combatants fighting each other to the death, such as a knight and a dragon, and a quack doctor who comes along to revive the fallen loser. Mummers deliver their narratives in rhyming couplets, and the plays generally do not require any special scenery or props beyond what the actors can carry on their person. This form of amateur acting is so popular and widespread that mummers are also a playable background (see pg. 23).": "衣着简陋的表演者，进行简单的戏剧表演。最经典的剧目是围绕着两个战斗人员的生死搏斗，如骑士和龙，以及一个前来救治失败者的庸医。姆默斯人用押韵的对联进行叙述，除了演员可以随身携带的东西外，戏剧一般不需要任何特殊的场景或道具。这种形式的业余表演非常流行和广泛，以至于姆默斯也是一种可玩的背景（见第23页）。",
	"Large, muscular men (or women, or anything really) who perform great feats of strength before an audience. Though extraordinarily strong creatures exist in the world, the strongman's performance hinges on convincing their audience that no ordinary person could do what they do. They most often secure this point by inviting a member of the audience to attempt the feat of strength first, and fail at it. Sometimes, the audience member is a \"plant\" (a carnie pretending to be an ordinary commoner) who is in on the gimmick, and knows how to fail spectacularly enough in front of an audience that even a rigged \"feat of strength\" could appear convincing.": "大块的、肌肉发达的男人（或女人，或任何东西，真的）在观众面前表现出巨大的力量。虽然世界上存在特别强壮的生物，但强人的表演取决于让观众相信没有一个普通人能做到他们所做的。他们通常通过邀请一名观众首先尝试力量的壮举，并且失败来确保这一点。有时，这个观众是一个 \"植物人\"（假装成普通人的卡尼），他参与了这个噱头，并知道如何在观众面前足够壮观地失败，即使是一个被操纵的 \"力量壮举 \"也会显得令人信服。",
	"Humanoid talents are not the only attraction of a circus or carnival. Though most people live in relatively close proximity to animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc), their pets or beasts of burden are generally trained only for specific tasks. Thus, the draw of \"a dog who can count\" or a horse who performs tricks can draw many to buy a ticket.": "人形人才不是马戏团或狂欢节的唯一吸引力。虽然大多数人生活在相对接近动物（狗、猫、马等）的地方，但他们的宠物或野兽一般只为特定任务而训练。因此，\"会数数的狗 \"或会表演技巧的马的抽奖可以吸引很多人买票。",
	"Performances of trained animals can take on many forms. The most classic examples may consist of dogs playing leapfrog, lions jumping through hoops, or elephants lifting humanoid gymnastic performers on their trunks. However, in a magical world, these marvelous feats of training might take on entirely different connotations. Druids using Speak With Animals can simply ask a bear to stand up and hold still while they balance a stack of spinning plates on his head. Animal training now becomes more of a matter of making friends and building trust, without having to worry about communicating what you want to a creature that can't understand.": "训练有素的动物的表演可以有多种形式。最经典的例子可能包括狗玩跳跃游戏，狮子跳圈，或大象用树干举起人形体操表演者。然而，在一个魔法世界里，这些奇妙的训练壮举可能具有完全不同的内涵。使用 \"与动物对话 \"的德鲁伊可以简单地要求一只熊站起来并保持不动，而他们在熊的头上平衡一摞旋转的盘子。动物训练现在变得更像是一个交朋友和建立信任的问题，而不必担心向一个无法理解的生物传达你想要什么。",
	"On the other hand, a polymorph spell could simply allow a humanoid who's learned their choreography to appear to be an especially well-trained animal. Keep in mind that, depending on how \"low magic\" or \"high magic\" your setting is, commoners may be considerably more impressed with animal tricks than an adventurer who's aware of such spells might be. If magic is commonplace in your setting, your circus performers may have to pull off considerably more impressive feats of animal training in order to wow their crowds.": "另一方面，一个多面体法术可以简单地让一个学会了他们编排的人形生物看起来是一个特别训练有素的动物。请记住，根据你的设定是 \"低魔法 \"还是 \"高魔法\"，平民可能比了解此类法术的冒险者对动物表演的印象要好得多。如果魔法在你的环境中很普遍，你的马戏团表演者可能不得不在动物训练方面做出更多令人印象深刻的壮举，以使他们的观众惊叹。",
	"Sometimes, it's not what an animal can do that is impressive, but merely their presence that can inspire awe and wonder in onlookers. Many common folk with live their entire lives within a relatively short distance of where they were born, and will never have the opportunity to travel abroad and see exotic creatures. When the menagerie comes into town, they'll be able to see all manner of wild creatures that they've only ever heard of in stories.": "有时，令人印象深刻的不是动物能做什么，而仅仅是它们的存在能激发旁观者的敬畏和惊奇。许多普通人一生都生活在他们出生地相对较短的距离内，永远没有机会到国外旅行，看到异国的生物。当动物园进城时，他们就能看到他们只在故事中听说过的各种野生动物。",
	"There's a significant difference between a travelling menagerie and one that is stationary. A single location (sometimes called an animal park or zoological garden) will often make efforts to display animals in environments similar to their native homes. Various feats of magic, technology, or simply importing flora from the animal's place of origin, may be used to accomplish this. Travelling menageries, however, are often limited to placing animals in cages small enough to be transported on wagons.": "旅行动物园和固定的动物园之间有很大区别。一个单一的地点（有时被称为动物公园或动物园）通常会努力在类似于其原生地的环境中展示动物。为了达到这个目的，可以使用各种魔法、技术，或者干脆从动物的原产地进口植物。然而，旅行动物园通常只限于将动物放在足够小的笼子里，以便用马车运输。",
	"Whatever form a menagerie takes, it generally is not as ideal as letting animals roam comfortably in their wild homes. For this reason, some people (especially those of the druidic persuasion) may be opposed to the practice of keeping animals captive for the amusement of humanoids. On the other hand, some menageries may fake their exotic display by utilizing magic, ranging from illusions to polymorphed entertainers.": "无论动物园采取什么形式，它通常都不如让动物在它们的野外家园舒适地漫游来得理想。因此，有些人（尤其是德鲁伊教派的人）可能会反对将动物圈养起来供人类娱乐的做法。另一方面，一些动物园可能会利用魔法来伪造其异国情调的展示，从幻觉到多面体的艺人。",
	"Though seeing an exotic animal from afar can be an amazing experience for many common folk, nothing quite beats being able to touch, feed, and pet an animal. However, putting wild animals and untrained people in close proximity to one another can be a dangerous gamble. For this reason, petting zoos often have to strike a balance between wild animals and safe animals. Interestingly enough, petting zoos can be more interesting to noble children than they would be to commoner children. Nobles will have more opportunities to travel and see exotic animals that a commoner would never see, but most commoners will deal with livestock on a relatively regular basis. Thus, a noble child may be enamoured with the opportunity to pet a pig or feed a goat, whereas a child raised on a farm would find nothing special about it.": "尽管对许多普通人来说，从远处看到异国动物是一种神奇的体验，但没有什么比能够触摸、喂养和抚摸动物更有意义的了。然而，把野生动物和未经训练的人放在一起，可能是一场危险的赌博。出于这个原因，宠物动物园通常必须在野生动物和安全动物之间取得平衡。有趣的是，对贵族儿童来说，宠物园可能比对平民儿童更有趣。贵族会有更多的机会去旅行，看到平民永远看不到的异国动物，但大多数平民会相对经常地与牲畜打交道。因此，一个贵族的孩子可能会迷上抚摸猪或喂羊的机会，而一个在农场长大的孩子会觉得这没什么特别的。",
	"Inspired by the \"carosella\", meaning \"little battle\", which originated as a cavalry training exercise. Originally, mounted soldiers would gallop in circles while tossing balls to one another, forcing them to sharpen their riding skills. The sight of armored knights on horseback was so enthralling to children, that the concept of the carousel was born. At a carousel, horses are tethered to a center post, so that they can only walk in a circular track. The horses may be covered in ornate finery, displaying colorful bridles and barding, and some horses may be ridden by costumed performers to carry on the illusion that children are riding among nobles or knights. Always seeking to stand out from the crowd, some carousel proprietors experiment with other creatures, such as camels, elephants, or riding mastiffs. The creativity of their mounts is limited only by the safety of the wild creatures they're dealing with. Some have also been known to affix fake horns to a horse's ornate head tack, in order to market themselves as having a carousel of unicorns. ": "灵感来自于 \"carosella\"，意思是 \"小战斗\"，它起源于一种骑兵训练。最初，骑马的士兵会绕着圈子飞奔，同时互相抛球，迫使他们磨练自己的骑马技巧。马背上的盔甲骑士的景象让孩子们非常着迷，因此旋转木马的概念应运而生。在旋转木马上，马匹被拴在一个中心柱子上，因此它们只能在一个圆形轨道上行走。马匹可能覆盖着华丽的装饰，展示着五颜六色的辔头和护套，有些马匹可能由化装的表演者骑着，以延续儿童在贵族或骑士中骑马的幻觉。为了从人群中脱颖而出，一些旋转木马的经营者尝试使用其他生物，如骆驼、大象或骑獒。他们的坐骑的创造力只受限于他们所面对的野生动物的安全。有些人还知道在马的华丽头饰上贴上假角，以推销自己拥有独角兽的旋转木马。",
	"Among the many structures set up at a carnival, the funhouse is perhaps the most eclectic of all. The entire premise of a funhouse is that it's fully enclosed, and people on the outside will pay to sate their curiosity of whatever lays within. The interior of a funhouse can take on many themes or present many experiences.": "在嘉年华会的众多建筑中，游乐场可能是最不拘一格的。游乐场的整个前提是它是完全封闭的，外面的人可以花钱来满足他们对里面的东西的好奇心。游乐场的内部可以有许多主题或呈现许多体验。",
	"{@b Hall Of Mirrors} - A simple \"maze\" of mirrored walls, presenting a challenge of traversal simply by the fact there are so many optical illusions. Many of the mirrors are warped, and will present the illusion that people are taller, shorter, thinner, or broader in their reflection. More wealthy carnivals may be able to afford magic mirrors that present more elaborate reflections, such as showing the viewer what they looked like in their youth, or what they might look like as a warrior, a royal, etc.": "{@b Hall Of Mirrors} - 一个由镜子组成的简单的 \"迷宫\"，仅仅因为有这么多的视觉错觉而带来了穿越的挑战。许多镜子都是扭曲的，会呈现出人更高、更矮、更瘦或更宽的错觉。更富裕的嘉年华会可能有能力购买魔镜，以呈现更多精心制作的反射，例如向观众展示他们年轻时的样子，或者他们作为战士、皇室成员的样子，等等。",
	"{@b Haunted House} - A themed funhouse that is presented as being \"haunted\", in which various contraptions or costumed actors attempt to scare or startle those passing through. Though still fully enclosed, a \"haunted\" funhouse will have many darkened windows or thinner walls, to allow the screams of the horrified audience to echo outward, drawing more curious viewers to purchase a ticket. Sometimes, carnies will disguise themselves as ordinary attendees in order to be abducted by a \"ghost\" or \"monster\" in front of others, presenting the illusion of danger.": "{@b Haunted House} - 一个以 \"闹鬼 \"为主题的游乐场，其中有各种装置或化装演员试图吓唬或惊吓那些经过的人。虽然仍然是完全封闭的，但 \"闹鬼 \"的游乐场会有许多黑暗的窗户或较薄的墙壁，以便让惊恐的观众的尖叫声向外回响，吸引更多好奇的观众来买票。有时，笑匠会把自己伪装成普通观众，以便在别人面前被 \"鬼 \"或 \"怪物 \"绑架，呈现出危险的幻觉。",
	"{@b Barrel Roll} - A tunnel section of the funhouse is in fact a large barrel on its side, which is spun by workers on the outside. Guests attempting to traverse the hall must try to walk at an angle in order to not be sent tumbling.": "{@b Barrel Roll} - 游乐场的一个隧道部分实际上是一个侧面的大木桶，由外面的工人旋转着。试图穿越大厅的客人必须尽量以一定的角度行走，以避免被送入翻滚中。",

	"Though often too difficult to set up on demand, a log flume ride can be a charming part of an agricultural fair.

	"During a fair, the lumber mill will often be shut down to allow workers time off to celebrate and relax.

	"If we were to follow the rules of modern archery competitions, we'd be running a very boring sort of contest. Each competitor would be given several dozen arrows to fire at a target, at increasingly shorter distances, for several rounds. This turns into somewhere between roughly 100 and 150 dice-rolls per competitor, if scored accurately. So instead of playing \"the long game\", our archery competitions endeavor to make a shorter contest more exciting.": "如果我们遵循现代射箭比赛的规则，我们将进行一种非常无聊的比赛。每位参赛者将得到几十支箭，以越来越短的距离射向一个目标，进行几轮比赛。如果准确计分的话，这就变成了每个参赛者大约100到150次掷骰子。因此，我们的射箭比赛不是玩 \"长游戏\"，而是努力使较短的比赛更加精彩。",
	"We're going to limit our formal options to shortbow, excluding heavy crossbows and the longbow from competition. By building our competition around a weapon with an effective range of 80 feet and a maximum range of 320, it keeps the playing field significantly smaller and easier to manage. This also gives room for hand crossbow and dagger-throwing characters to petition for entry to competitions, should you so desire. They'll be competing at a marked disadvantage, but they'll still have a fighting chance, and nothing feels cooler than beating the odds.": "我们要把正式的选择限制在短弓上，把重弩和长弓排除在竞争之外。通过围绕一种有效射程为80英尺、最大射程为320英尺的武器建立我们的比赛，可以使比赛场地明显缩小，更容易管理。这也为手弩和匕首投掷角色申请参加比赛提供了空间，如果你愿意的话。他们将在竞争中处于明显的劣势，但他们仍然有一个战斗的机会，没有什么比战胜困难的感觉更酷了。",
	"That being said, you're welcome to take the provided rules and modify them to work with longer-ranged weaponry, custom weapons like guns, etc.When most people think of an archery competition, they think of competitors standing in a row, shooting at targets at a fixed location, each trying to land their shot as close to the bullseye as possible.

	"In standard combat, the only ranges that matter for shooting a bow are effective range, and maximum range. However, it's important to remember that in combat, hitting a target with a powerful strike is generally more important than exactly where the target is hit; hitting a particular location is generally the realm of narrative freedom in 5th edition. For most enemies, a matter of an inch or two difference in the location of the hit is inconsequential to the damage being dealt. In target-shooting competition however, an inch or two can determine who's standing on the podium in the end. Thus, the ACs for different rings of the target will vary based on the distance from the target. ": "在标准战斗中，对弓箭射击来说，唯一重要的范围是有效范围和最大范围。然而，重要的是要记住，在战斗中，以强大的攻击力击中目标通常比目标被击中的确切位置更重要；在第五版中，击中一个特定的位置通常是叙述的自由领域。对于大多数敌人来说，被击中的位置相差一两英寸对所造成的伤害是无足轻重的。然而在打靶比赛中，一两英寸就能决定谁能站在最后的领奖台上。因此，目标的不同环的AC值将根据与目标的距离而变化。",
	"If one of your players has taken the Sharpshooter feat, they will have several benefits that may help them edge out other shooters. One of these is the opportunity to take a penalty to an attack roll, but if it hits, they can add a large bonus to the attack's damage. Choosing to take a penalty on an attack role in a competition focused on accuracy may be a dangerous risk, but if you have a player who decides to go for it, make sure you reward them for a success! If they strike the target, and make a reasonably high damage roll, let them split or splinter the wooden target. Of course, don't prompt them to do this, or let them know it's an option...

	"Food is a part of many holidays and festivals, and eating large amounts of food is considered a primary method of celebration by many. It stands to reason that someone's competitive nature meant an eating contest would be born. Typically, eating contests select a single food item as their focus. Pies are common, as they are made to a uniform size and density. However, any food could be used, ranging from apples, to ears of corn, to giant turkey legs. Judges are always on hand to ensure that the food is fully consumed, and an excess of food is not left behind (pie crust still in the pan, meat left on a bone, etc). Competitors are disqualified if they stand from the table, pass out at the table, or if they throw up. The last competitor still eating, wins. Competitors in a pie eating contest make Constitution saves for each pie they eat, with the DC steadily raising for each pie eaten. If a competitor fails their Constitution save, they are given the \"full\" status. They may continue to compete if they wish, but additional saves will be made with disadvantage. Failing another Constitution save after becoming full, will cause the competitor to vomit (or pass out, if you feel players at your table may be squeamish).": "食物是许多假期和节日的一部分，吃大量的食物被许多人认为是庆祝的主要方法。按理说，有人的竞争天性意味着会有饮食比赛的诞生。通常情况下，饮食比赛选择一种单一的食品作为其重点。馅饼很常见，因为它们的大小和密度都是统一的。然而，任何食物都可以使用，从苹果、玉米穗到巨型火鸡腿。裁判员总是在现场，以确保食物被完全吃完，并且没有留下多余的食物（饼皮还在锅里，肉留在骨头上，等等）。如果参赛者从桌子上站起来，在桌子上晕倒，或者呕吐，就会被取消资格。最后一个仍在吃的参赛者获胜。吃饼比赛的参赛者每吃一个饼都要进行宪法拯救，每吃一个饼，DC就会稳步提高。如果参赛者没有通过体质救赎，他们将被授予 \"完全 \"状态。如果他们愿意，他们可以继续参加比赛，但额外的救赎将以不利的方式进行。饱食之后，如果再一次救赎失败，将导致竞争者呕吐（或昏迷，如果你觉得你的桌子上的玩家可能会胆怯）。",
	"If your competitors somehow make it past round 10, continue to add 5 to the DC for each additional round of eating.

The goal of a sheep-shearing race is for each competitor to shear every sheep in their pen as quickly as possible without causing injury.": "在典型的农场环境中，由于可以使用较热的水，所以在剪毛后要对羊群进行清洗。出于比赛的目的，羊群要事先清洗，以去除植物物质、毛刺、污垢等。挑选羊只时，要看其绒毛的大小和生长情况是否一致，并将其分到几个羊圈。剪羊毛比赛的目的是让每个参赛者在不造成伤害的情况下尽可能快地剪掉自己羊圈里的每只羊。",
	"When running a sheep-shearing race, competitors roll 1d20 per round, adding their Dexterity Bonus or Wisdom (Animal Handling). This number is kept, and added to for each subsequent round. The first competitor to reach 80pts wins the race. If two characters reach 80pts on the same round, the one who exceeded 80 by the highest number wins by mere seconds.

	"Instead of counting each individual sheep, or timing exactly how long it takes, each rolled round of sheep-shearing roughly illustrates how efficiently a competitor is working. As long as no one is shearing sheep in the same initiative order as a nearby round of combat, the fact that it no longer adheres to the \"six-second turn\" model is inconsequential.": "与其计算每只羊的数量，或者精确计算所需时间，每一轮滚动的剪羊毛都大致说明了竞争者的工作效率如何。只要没有人以与附近一轮战斗相同的主动权顺序来剪羊毛，不再遵守 \"六秒回合 \"模式这一事实就无关紧要。",
	"When performed properly, sheep are not injured in the shearing process. A struggling sheep might earn a nick or two, but a proper farmer will see that any injuries are treated to prevent infection and harm to their flock. After all, their flock is their livelihood. As mentioned above, the goal is to shear sheep as quickly as possible without causing injury.": "如果操作得当，羊群不会在剪羊毛的过程中受伤。挣扎的羊可能会挣到一两个缺口，但一个合适的农民会看到任何伤害都得到治疗，以防止感染和对羊群的伤害。毕竟，他们的羊群是他们的生计。如上所述，目标是在不造成伤害的情况下尽快剪掉羊群。",
	"Animal cruelty is a subject that can easily provoke a negative emotional response. Even people who have never owned pets or been close to animals themselves, tend to feel a distaste for the idea of causing needless harm to an animal, especially if that animal isn't aggressive. Though it would be reasonable to apply a penalty for injuring a sheep in the course of the shearing race, instead, we work off of the assumption that a struggling sheep simply {@i wastes more time}, in the shearer's effort not to cause injury. Though your mileage may vary, we felt this was the best method of avoiding a provoking subject.": "虐待动物是一个很容易激起负面情绪反应的话题。即使是那些从未养过宠物或自己接近过动物的人，也会对对动物造成无谓伤害的想法感到厌恶，特别是在那个动物没有攻击性的情况下。虽然在剪羊毛的过程中，对受伤的羊进行惩罚是合理的，但我们的做法是，假设挣扎的羊只是{@i wastes more time}，在剪羊毛的人努力不造成伤害。尽管你的想法可能有所不同，但我们认为这是避免挑衅性话题的最佳方法。",
	"On a standard dairy farm, cows are milked two to three times a day, and may produce as much as six or seven gallons of milk a day. The process of milking a cow requires good grip, strong arms, and a steady pace. Of course, it also involves working in extremely close proximity to a live, large animal, which comes with its own set of challenges. Cow milking competitions involve cows being carefully tethered to keep them in one place, and buckets are provided with goal lines marked on the inside. The first competitor to fill their bucket to the goal line, wins.": "在一个标准的奶牛场，奶牛每天要挤两到三次奶，每天的产奶量可能高达6或7加仑。给奶牛挤奶的过程需要良好的握力、有力的手臂和稳定的步伐。当然，这也涉及到在极其接近活生生的大动物的情况下工作，这就有了自己的一系列挑战。奶牛挤奶比赛涉及将奶牛小心翼翼地拴在一个地方，并提供水桶，里面标有目标线。第一个将水桶装到目标线的参赛者获胜。",

	"Cows can be easily spooked, and competition environments with strangers trying to milk them can make them especially nervous. If you want to add an extra layer of difficulty to the game, you can consider adding unique events for low rolls. These can range from cows struggling and squirming too much to be milked (losing a turn), kicking over the bucket (resetting their score to 0), or even kicking the competitor (1d4 bludgeoning damage). Simply consider how cruel you're willing to be to your players.": "奶牛很容易受到惊吓，而有陌生人试图挤奶的竞争环境会让它们特别紧张。如果你想给游戏增加一层难度，你可以考虑为低卷添加独特的事件。这些事件的范围包括：奶牛挣扎和扭动得太厉害而无法挤奶（失去一个回合），踢翻水桶（将它们的分数重置为0），甚至踢到竞争者（1d4重击伤害）。只需考虑你愿意对你的玩家有多残忍。",
	"Though some farmers keep their pigs in organized pens, some allow them to run freely in cool, boggy areas. Feeding time requires the farmers to call their free-roaming pigs back to them, and over time, farmers have learned that pigs respond to loud, shrill sounds (perhaps resembling a piglet squealing). Thus, competition to see who could encourage their pigs to return the fastest, was born.": "虽然有些农民把猪关在有组织的围栏里，但有些农民允许猪在凉爽的沼泽地里自由奔跑。喂食时间要求农民把自由奔跑的猪叫回来，随着时间的推移，农民了解到，猪对响亮的、尖锐的声音（也许类似于小猪的尖叫声）有反应。因此，看谁能鼓励他们的猪最快回来的竞争就诞生了。",
	"When running a pig calling contest, competitors take turns instead of going simultaneously. Competitors roll 1d20 per round, adding their Charisma Bonus or Wisdom (Animal Handling).

	"Whether or not you consider magic spells to be legal or illegal in the contest, is up to your discretion. If a spellcaster uses {@spell Speak With Animals}, you may give them advantage on all of their pig calling rolls. For the purpose of the contest, pigs are considered medium creatures (like wild boars), therefore not affected by the Forest Gnome's Speak With Small Beasts racial feature": "在比赛中，你是否认为法术是合法或非法的，由你来决定。如果施法者使用{@spell Speak With Animals}，你可以让他们在所有召唤猪的卷轴上取得优势。在比赛中，猪被认为是中等生物（如野猪），因此不受森林地精的 \"与小兽交谈 \"种族特征的影响。",
	"Many carnival games are, in fact, rigged. They are designed to make it appear easy to win, but use tricks of perspective, distraction, and faulty equipment to tilt the games in favor of the operators rather than the players. Furthermore, many carnies provide examples of the games being played to show how \"easily\" they can be won, at least, with their added benefit of standing in a different location than the players, knowing exactly where to hit, or using different equipment.": "许多狂欢节游戏事实上是被操纵的。它们被设计成看起来很容易赢，但却利用视角、分心和有缺陷的设备等技巧，使游戏向有利于经营者而非玩家的方向倾斜。此外，许多车夫提供游戏的例子，以显示它们是多么 \"容易 \"获胜，至少，他们的额外好处是站在与玩家不同的位置，确切地知道该打哪里，或使用不同的设备。",
	"Carnival games should always have a cost to play. This cost is at your discretion, and may vary based on the clientele of the carnival; nobles may be willing to pay up to 1gp per game to try their hand, whereas a carnival catering to commoners may only be able to get away with 5cp or 1sp per game.": "狂欢节游戏应该总是有成本的。这个费用由你决定，并可能根据嘉年华会的客户群而有所不同；贵族可能愿意为每场游戏支付高达1gp的费用，而为平民服务的嘉年华会可能只能以每场5cp或1sp的价格成交。",
	"It's theorized that the \"sport\" of jumping on the back of an illtempered bull and trying to hold on for as long as possible was originally pioneered by farmhands, borne of a mixture of boredom and drunkenness.

	"Unlike many carnival games, the bucking bull is never rigged per say, but instead, the carnies hawking the challenge suggest that the rider must only stay on for a very brief period of time, and that it can't be that hard. In truth, it is actually that hard.": "与许多狂欢节游戏不同的是，斗牛从来没有被操纵过，相反，兜售这一挑战的狂欢者暗示，骑手必须只在很短的时间内停留，而且不可能那么难。事实上，它实际上是很难的。",
	"The goal is to remain on the gorgon for eight rounds, making strength-opposed grapple checks against the bucking monstrosity. For the purposes of this contest, the rule that creatures cannot grapple a creature more than one size larger them no longer applies; they are holding onto the saddle, not the gorgon itself. Therefore, small sized creatures may enter at their own risk.": "我们的目标是在高竿上停留8个回合，对这只降压的怪兽进行力量对抗的抓捕检查。在这场比赛中，生物不能抓取比自己大一号的生物的规则不再适用；他们抓的是马鞍，而不是高脚龙本身。因此，小体型的生物可以参加，但风险自负。",

	"In general, a holiday is a day determined by law or tradition, commemorating an important historic event. Most businesses close, and any job that is not an essential service (town guards, healers, etc) is reduced or suspended for the day.

	"Many holidays are comprised of more than just the event itself. Traditions become associated with holidays over time, and will reflect decor, food, music, games, gift-giving, and other practices.": "许多节日不仅仅是由活动本身组成的。随着时间的推移，传统会与节日联系在一起，并反映出装饰、食物、音乐、游戏、礼物赠送和其他做法。",
	"The date on the calendar is an important element of designing your holiday, as decor will often be influenced by signs of the season. A harvest festival will likely use autumnal colors, while a spring festival will use bright colors and myriad green shades to represent new life and growth.": "日历上的日期是设计节日的一个重要因素，因为装饰往往会受到季节迹象的影响。一个收获的节日可能会使用秋天的颜色，而一个春天的节日会使用明亮的颜色和无数的绿色色调来代表新的生命和成长。",
	"The climate will also play a distinct factor in how a holiday is celebrated. Holidays during heavily rainy seasons will likely be indoor affairs, focusing on togetherness. Holidays during the hottest weather will often involve ways to keep cool.": "气候也会对节日的庆祝方式起到明显的影响。在多雨的季节里，节日可能是室内活动，重点是团结一致。在最热的天气里，节日往往会涉及到保持凉爽的方法。",
	"Some holidays are held in remembrance of people or events. When remembering people, these holidays are often composed posthumously, and great figures in history are celebrated after their death. As such, the holiday could be celebrated on the day they died, the day they performed a great feat, or it could be celebrated on their birthday.": "有些节日是为了纪念人或事件而举行的。在纪念人时，这些节日往往是在死后组成的，历史上的伟大人物都是在死后庆祝的。因此，节日可以在他们去世的那一天庆祝，也可以在他们完成伟大壮举的那一天庆祝，还可以在他们的生日庆祝。",

Very often, a solemn ceremony or religious service will be held early in the day, followed by more joyous celebrations in the afternoon and evening.": "尽管追悼会可能是一个严肃的事务，但这并不意味着庆祝活动中不能有任何轻松的气氛。很多时候，庄严的仪式或宗教仪式将在当天早些时候举行，然后在下午和晚上举行更多欢乐的庆祝活动。",
	"The oppression or ownership of any person is a terrible thing. Worse still is when these acts of oppression or slavery are sanctioned or even enforced by governing powers. Obtaining one's freedom is usually a bloody affair, and requires not only the defeat of slavers, but the overturning of laws and social perceptions that make such oppression possible at its core. An economy built on slave-labor is generally not willing to just give slaves their freedom peacefully, and very often, they've built the mindset that their slaves are \"lesser beings\" that are either undeserving of their freedom, or might be dangerous if freed.": "对任何人的压迫或所有权是一件可怕的事情。更糟糕的是，当这些压迫或奴役行为得到执政者的认可甚至强制执行的时候。获得自由通常是一件血腥的事情，不仅需要打败奴隶主，还需要推翻使这种压迫成为可能的法律和社会观念的核心。一个建立在奴隶劳动基础上的经济体通常不愿意和平地给予奴隶自由，而且往往他们已经建立了这样的心态：他们的奴隶是 \"低等生物\"，要么不值得他们获得自由，要么如果获得自由可能是危险的。",
	"Even a bloodless rebellion will often involve great hardships, such as fleeing over great distances, hiding in dangerous wilderness or climates, and long periods of uncertainty before being able to settle again. Thus, these celebrations can be vitally important for embracing the freedom and peace of mind that one's ancestors were denied.": "即使是不流血的叛乱，也往往会涉及巨大的困难，如远距离逃亡，躲藏在危险的荒野或气候中，以及在能够重新定居之前的漫长的不确定性。因此，这些庆祝活动对于拥抱自己的祖先被剥夺的自由和心灵的平静可能是极其重要的。",
	"Celebrating freedom from slavery and oppression is often a mixture of both solemn memorial, and jubilant celebration. Leaders and resistors who fought for their freedom are remembered, as well as mourning for those who died before seeing their people achieve freedom. It is also a time to revel in one's freedom, and showcase cultural practices that were denied to them while in captivity. Many enslaved peoples are stripped of their cultural practices and rights in an effort to demoralize them. This can mean the outlawing of their dances, songs, arts, and even important ceremonies for marriage or child-naming. Thus, celebrations of freedom from slavery may place importance on these nearly-lost parts of one's culture. Some ceremonies may even take on new facets from the ways that they were practiced in secret, such as \"walking around a large tree and greeting one another on the other side\" becoming an important wedding tradition.": "庆祝摆脱奴隶制和压迫的自由，往往是庄严的纪念和欢快的庆祝。人们缅怀为自由而战的领导人和抵抗者，同时也哀悼那些在看到自己的人民获得自由之前就死去的人。这也是一个为自己的自由而陶醉的时刻，并展示他们在被囚禁期间被剥夺的文化习俗。许多被奴役的人民被剥夺了他们的文化习俗和权利，以努力使他们丧失士气。这可能意味着他们的舞蹈、歌曲、艺术，甚至重要的婚姻或儿童命名仪式被取缔。因此，摆脱奴隶制的庆祝活动可能会重视一个人的文化中这些几乎消失的部分。一些仪式甚至可能从秘密进行的方式中获得新的面貌，例如 \"绕着一棵大树走，在另一边相互问候 \"成为重要的婚礼传统。",
	"When designing a holiday to celebrate freedom from slavery or oppression, remember to think of it from various viewpoints. Why were the formerly-enslaved people singled out (racial or religious differences, defeated in a previous war, etc)? How are the formerly-enslaved peoples treated by their former oppressors? Are formerly-enslaved people still oppressed from an economic standpoint? Do they have true equality, or are they still looked down upon by other groups? Do the former oppressors feel as though they are now the injured or unfairly-treated party in this situation? Also keep in mind that no large group holds all of the same opinions as one another; some descendants of slave-owners may feel remorseful for the actions of their ancestors, while others may prefer to carry on a tradition of hatred.": "在设计一个庆祝摆脱奴隶制或压迫的节日时，记得要从不同的角度来考虑它。为什么以前的被奴役者会被挑出来（种族或宗教差异，在以前的战争中被打败，等等）？以前被奴役的人民是如何被他们以前的压迫者对待的？从经济角度看，以前的被奴役者是否仍然受到压迫？他们是否有真正的平等，还是仍然被其他群体看不起？在这种情况下，以前的压迫者是否觉得他们现在是受害方或受到不公平待遇的一方？还要记住，没有一个大的群体彼此持有所有相同的观点；一些奴隶主的后代可能对他们祖先的行为感到悔恨，而另一些人可能更愿意继承仇恨的传统。",

	"This holiday is a mixture of Easter celebrations, the idiom of the Golden Goose, and a particular Japanese fairytale! It also utilizes the Swanmay, a classic AD&D race of humanoid women who can transform into birds. Though at the time of this publication the Swanmay have not appeared in D&D since 3.5e, some intrepid writers on the DM's Guild have brought the race into the light of 5th edition. Legend has it that a poor and lonely hunter once found an injured swan at the side of a frozen lake, surrounded by wolves. Running off the wolves, the hunter saved the swan, and brought her to his home where he mended her broken wing and took care of her throughout the winter. Once the swan healed, she flew away in the spring. At the start of the next winter, the hunter was visited by a beautiful woman travelling through the woods near his home. The two fell in love and married. Though the hunter and his bride were happy together, they were very poor. Feeling guilty that he could not provide for his lovely wife, the hunter became depressed. One day, the hunter's wife came out of their chicken coop and handed him a golden egg she'd found, encouraging him to hurry to the nearby town and sell it. The hunter did, and he brought back a sack of money and enough food for them to feast on for days. Time passed, and when the money ran out, the hunter's wife found another golden egg for him to sell. When spring came, the hunter asked his wife which of their chickens was providing golden eggs, but she merely told him not to worry about it, and not to go into the chicken coop when she was tending to the birds. Though the hunter begrudgingly agreed, his curiosity got the better of him one day. When his wife went into the chicken coop, he peered through a crack in the wooden wall. To his shock, he watched his wife transform into a swan, and lay a golden egg. The hunter cried out in surprise, and startled the swan.": "这个节日是复活节庆祝活动、金鹅的成语和一个特殊的日本童话的混合体！它还利用了天鹅美，这个经典的AD&D种族可以变成鸟类。它还利用了天鹅美，一个经典的AD&D种族，即可以变身为鸟类的人形女性。尽管在本书出版时，天鹅绒还没有出现在D&D的3.5e版本中，但DM's Guild的一些无畏的作者已经将这个种族带到了第五版中。传说中，一个贫穷而孤独的猎人曾经在一个冰湖边发现了一只受伤的天鹅，周围都是狼。猎人赶走了狼群，救下了天鹅，并把她带到了自己的家里，在那里他修补了她受伤的翅膀，并照顾了她整个冬天。一旦天鹅痊愈，她就在春天飞走了。第二年冬天开始时，一位在他家附近的森林里旅行的美丽女子拜访了猎人。两人相爱并结婚。虽然猎人和他的新娘在一起很幸福，但他们却非常贫穷。猎人因为不能供养他可爱的妻子而感到内疚，变得很沮丧。有一天，猎人的妻子从他们的鸡舍里出来，递给他一个她发现的金蛋，鼓励他赶紧去附近的镇上卖掉它。猎人照做了，他带回了一袋钱和足够他们吃上好几天的食物。时间一天天过去，钱用完了，猎人的妻子又找到一个金蛋让他去卖。当春天来临的时候，猎人问他的妻子是哪只鸡在提供金蛋，但她只是告诉他不要担心，当她照看小鸡的时候不要进入鸡舍。虽然猎人勉强同意了，但有一天他的好奇心还是得到了满足。当他的妻子进入鸡舍时，他从木墙的缝隙中窥视。令他震惊的是，他看到妻子变成了一只天鹅，并下了一个金蛋。猎人惊讶地叫了起来，吓了天鹅一跳。",
	"The hunter's wife emerged from the chicken coop, sobbing. She admitted to him that she was the swan he had saved the previous winter, and was Princess of the Swanmay. But, now that he knew her secret, she could no longer stay with him. Though her husband tearfully begged for forgiveness, the heartbroken princess turned back into a swan and flew away. Though the tale of love lost and trust broken is an important fable, many folk latch onto more superficial aspects of the story. Every spring, celebrants of the Day Of The Golden Swan go into woods to search for golden (or jeweled) eggs left by theoretical Swanmay royalty. As the story (and possibility of finding treasure) is so enthralling to young children, the holiday is built around entertaining them. Fresh eggs are carefully emptied by poking a small hole in both ends and blowing out the contents. The emptied shells are then decorated in any number of ways. Many households dye them by boiling them with vegetables or berries, and some paint designs on them, or paste pieces of paper to the outside. Adults will hide decorated eggs in the woods near their homes, and then send children out (under watchful supervision) to try to find the hidden eggs. Because the empty egg shells are quite fragile, children are encouraged not to be rambunctious in their hunt. Small prizes or treats are often awarded to the children who find the most (intact) eggs, or who find eggs that were especially cleverly hidden.": "猎人的妻子从鸡笼里走出来，泣不成声。她向他承认，她就是他前年冬天救下的那只天鹅，是天鹅梅的公主。但是，现在他知道了她的秘密，她不能再和他在一起了。尽管她的丈夫含泪乞求原谅，这位伤心的公主还是变回了天鹅，飞走了。尽管这个关于失去爱情和信任的故事是一个重要的寓言，但许多民间人士却抓住了故事中更多肤浅的方面。每年春天，金天鹅节的庆祝者都会到树林里寻找理论上天鹅美皇室成员留下的金蛋（或珠宝蛋）。由于这个故事（以及找到宝藏的可能性）对年幼的孩子来说是如此吸引人，这个节日是围绕着娱乐他们而建立的。新鲜的鸡蛋被小心翼翼地掏出来，在两端戳一个小洞，然后把里面的东西吹出来。清空后的蛋壳可以用任何方式进行装饰。许多家庭用蔬菜或浆果煮鸡蛋来染色，有些家庭在鸡蛋上画图案，或在外面贴上纸片。大人们会把装饰好的鸡蛋藏在他们家附近的树林里，然后让孩子们出去（在有人监督的情况下），试图找到隐藏的鸡蛋。由于空蛋壳相当脆弱，因此鼓励孩子们在寻找过程中不要太过狂躁。找到最多（完整的）鸡蛋的孩子，或者找到隐藏得特别巧妙的鸡蛋的孩子，通常会得到小奖品或点心。",

Thus, pastel colors like powder pink, baby blue, mint, lavender, and periwinkle are commonly associated with the holiday, but brighter colors may also be painted directly on the eggs": "大多数常见的染料在蛋壳上附着力很差，所以许多鸡蛋都是粉色的。因此，粉红色、婴儿蓝、薄荷色、薰衣草色和长春花色等柔和的颜色通常与这个节日有关，但更鲜艳的颜色也可以直接画在鸡蛋上。",

It is based on the pagan holiday of Beltane, practiced in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle Of Man.": "这个节日在以牛为重要主食的农村地区效果最好，不过你也可以修改一下，把重点放在任何可能被赶到夏季牧场的动物上。这个节日的许多方面也很适合异族参与。这个节日通常在西方日历的5月1日举行，或者大致在春分和夏至之间。它基于异教节日Beltane，在爱尔兰、苏格兰和马恩岛实行。",
	"At the start of summer, cattle owners will drive their cattle to new pastures. This is often a major undertaking, and in order to protect their herd from illness and misfortune, they will reach out to nearby druid circles to ask for blessings. Understanding the destructive, but also renewing properties of fire, a druid circle pioneered this night-time festival to cleanse a farm house of ill omens and start the summer season fresh. Over time, the festival grew beyond just farmers and their cattle, and now entire towns take part in the celebration.": "在夏季开始时，牛主人会把他们的牛赶到新的牧场。这通常是一项重要的工作，为了保护他们的牛群不受疾病和不幸的影响，他们会向附近的德鲁伊圈子求助，请求祝福。由于了解火的破坏性，但也有更新的特性，一个德鲁伊圈率先在夜间举行这个节日，以清洗农舍的不祥之兆，并开始新的夏季。随着时间的推移，这个节日逐渐超越了农民和他们的牛，现在整个城镇都参加了这个庆祝活动。",
	"The day of the Bonfire Bash, children and young women will wake early in the morning to go and pick flowers like marigolds, hazel, hawthorn, and primrose. These yellow flowers, thought to symbolize fire, will be woven into garlands or gathered into bouquets, and will be used to decorate houses, cattle, and equipment used in churning butter.": "篝火晚会那天，儿童和年轻妇女会在清晨醒来，去采摘金盏花、榛子、山楂和报春花等鲜花。这些被认为象征着火的黄花将被编织成花环或收集成花束，并被用来装饰房屋、牛和用于搅动黄油的设备。",
	"Though fae are mysterious creatures and little is known about them by most common folk, superstitions run rampant. One such superstition is that fairies are especially active around the start of summer. Thus, locals will also make visits to locations where fairies are known or suspected to inhabit, to make offerings like milk, berries, flowers, and naturebased treasures like sea shells, uncut jewels, and wooden beads. Because fairies are known for their mischievousness, townsfolk and farmers hope to appease (or at least distract) the fairies during their bonfire rituals.": "虽然异族是神秘的生物，大多数普通人对他们知之甚少，但迷信却很猖獗。其中一个迷信是，仙女在夏天开始的时候特别活跃。因此，当地人也会到已知或怀疑有仙女居住的地方去，献上牛奶、浆果、鲜花以及海贝、未切割的珠宝和木珠等基于自然的宝物。由于仙女以其顽皮著称，乡民和农民希望在篝火仪式上安抚（或至少分散）仙女的注意力。",
	"At sun down, every household fire in the town is put out. Even blacksmiths may be willing to put their work on hold to baffle down their forges. Meanwhile, druids or other local spiritual figures construct two large bonfires out in an open field. Under the guidance of the druids and spiritual leaders, cattle are driven between the two flames, believing that the fires will chase away any ills attached to them.": "太阳落山时，镇上每家每户的火都被扑灭。甚至铁匠们也可能愿意把他们的工作搁置起来，把他们的锻炉关掉。同时，德鲁伊或其他当地精神人物在空地上建造两个大篝火。在德鲁伊和精神领袖的指导下，牛被赶到这两堆火之间，相信火会赶走与它们有关的任何病痛。",
	"While every town practices it differently, common celebrations include drinking, dancing, sacrificing animals, and/or cooking communal meals on smaller bonfires lit from the two large fires. Jumping over fire pits is also a common activity, practiced by young men or women to show their bravery, or by lovers to show their devotion to one another (\"leaping through fire to be together\"). Once the festivities have ended, every member of the town takes a torch and lights it at one of the two giant bonfires of the festival. This flame is then used to re-light the fires in their homes, warming their hearths with a fresh and pure light. The next day, the ashes from the bonfire are collected and scattered on crops.": "虽然每个城镇的做法不同，但常见的庆祝活动包括饮酒、跳舞、祭祀动物和/或在两个大火点燃的小篝火上做公共餐。跳过火坑也是一项常见的活动，由年轻男子或妇女进行，以显示他们的勇敢，或由恋人进行，以显示他们对彼此的奉献（\"跳过火坑，在一起\"）。庆典结束后，镇上的每个人都拿着火把，在节日的两个巨大篝火中的一个点燃。然后，这束火焰被用来重新点燃他们家中的火，用新鲜和纯净的光线温暖他们的炉灶。第二天，篝火的灰烬被收集起来，撒在农作物上。",
	"Yellow flowers are the primary decor of the Bonfire Bash, but yellow clothing is also very popular among those with the complexion to pull it off. Aside from bouquets and garlands of yellow flowers, the Bonfire Bash has very little in the way of decor. Fire itself is an important symbol, but is utilized as a tool more so than displayed as decoration.": "黄花是篝火晚会的主要装饰，但黄色的衣服在那些有肤色的人中也非常流行。除了黄花的花束和花环，篝火晚会上的装饰很少。火本身是一个重要的象征，但更多地是作为一种工具来使用，而不是作为装饰来展示。",
	"An oatmeal cake called the \"Bonfire Bannock\" is cooked on griddles over small bonfires, shared by townsfolk, and also offered to the cattle. Roasted lamb is the traditional dinner at many Bonfire Bashes. Of course, drinking is also very common, but given the proximity to fire and the need to tend to herds of cattle the next day, most people try to keep it from getting out of hand.": "一种被称为 \"篝火班诺克 \"的燕麦饼在小篝火上用烤炉烤制，由乡亲们分享，也提供给牛群。烤羊肉是许多篝火晚会的传统晚餐。当然，喝酒也很常见，但考虑到离火很近，而且第二天需要照顾成群的牛，大多数人都尽量不让它失控。",
	"The crux of this festival is location and season. The ideal locale is a village or town located at the base of a mountain. By keeping the settlement small, it reduces the wealth and access to magical options, meaning the locals have to resort to more mundane means of keeping cool. The core of the festival is inspired by a summer practice of Japanese nobles in the Heian Period.": "这个节日的关键是地点和季节。理想的地点是位于山脚下的村庄或城镇。通过保持定居点的规模，它减少了财富和获得魔法的机会，这意味着当地人不得不采用更多的世俗手段来保持凉爽。这个节日的核心灵感来自平安时代日本贵族的夏季习俗。",
	"Not every holiday begins with a fairytale or superstition. Sometimes, a holiday forms purely out of an observation of the seasons, or in reaction to a worldly change. The Summer Breeze Festival is not widely celebrated, but it is a vital community activity for some villages in the dead of summer. In order to beat the sweltering summer heat, this small farming town prepares a week in advance of the Summer Breeze Festival by sending groups of farm hands up into the nearby mountain. For three days straight, the groups of four to eight young men and women depart in the morning, carrying empty chests on litters. The groups travel for days up to a specially built \"pantry\" high up in the side of the mountain to retrieve large blocks of ice, packing them into their lined chests, before descending the mountain again.": "并非每个节日都是以童话或迷信开始的。有时，一个节日的形成纯粹是出于对季节的观察，或对世俗变化的反应。夏风节没有得到广泛的庆祝，但它是一些村庄在夏日里的一项重要社区活动。为了抵御炎热的夏季，这个小农镇在夏风节前一周就开始准备，把一批批农夫送到附近的山上。连续三天，这些由四至八名青年男女组成的小组在早晨出发，用轿子抬着空箱子。这群人连续几天到山边高处专门建造的 \"储藏室 \"去取大块的冰，把它们装进有衬里的箱子，然后再下山。",
	"For the three days of the festival itself, the groups arrive to great fanfare, bringing half-melted ice blocks to the grateful residents. The remaining ice is shaved by workers and served in bowls, drizzled with sweet syrups made from locally grown fruits. Though the ice doesn't last long, and the hot weather will continue for weeks to come, the festival is a welcome break for laborers at the hottest point in the summer.": "在节日的三天里，这些团体大张旗鼓地来到这里，把半融化的冰块带给感激的居民。剩下的冰块由工人刨开，装在碗里，淋上用当地种植的水果制成的甜味糖浆。尽管冰块不会持续很久，而且炎热的天气将持续数周，但在夏季最热的时候，这个节日对劳动者来说是一个受欢迎的休息。",
	"Streamers made of strips of cloth are hung from the eaves of buildings, sometimes tied to bells or chimes, in order to flutter and chime whenever a breeze blows through. In poorer homes, these cloth strips are made of whatever can be repurposed, such as clothing that has been damaged and recycled into rags. In wealthier homes, strips of white and blue linen or silk are preferred.": "由布条制成的彩旗被挂在建筑物的屋檐下，有时绑在铃铛或风铃上，以便每当有微风吹过时，彩旗就会飘动并发出响声。在较贫穷的家庭，这些布条是用任何可以重新利用的东西制成的，如被损坏的衣服，回收成破布。在较富裕的家庭，首选白色和蓝色亚麻布或丝绸的布条。",
	"While shaved ice is the most classic staple of the festival, a variety of fresh fruits are also consumed, usually having been lightly chilled in a nearby river immediately before sale.": "虽然刨冰是节日中最经典的主食，但各种新鲜水果也被消费，通常在销售前会在附近的河流中轻度冰冻。",
	"The influences on this holiday may be as obvious as they are numerous, drawing inspiration from Halloween, Samhain, Dia de Muertos, Bon Odori, and many others. Depending on the mythos related to death and the afterlife in your particular setting, you may have to fiddle with some of the details, but the door is wide open for the potential of having actual ghostly involvement in the holiday.": "这个节日的影响可能是显而易见的，因为它从万圣节、Samhain、Dia de Muertos、Bon Odori和其他许多地方汲取了灵感。根据你的特定环境中与死亡和来世有关的神话，你可能不得不对一些细节进行调整，但大门是敞开的，有可能让鬼魂参与到这个节日中。",
	"Legend has it that long ago, two men fought each other in a joust, for the affections of the woman they loved. One of the men died when he was thrown from his injured horse and broke his neck, and the winner went on to marry the lady they had both adored. Many years later, the now retired jouster was walking home late at night when he saw a rider on horseback on a hill. The rider was silhouetted before the moon, but he could see that the rider's own head was but the skull of a horse, and his eyes glowed like candles.": "传说在很久以前，有两个人为了争夺他们所爱的女人的感情，在一场比武中互相争斗。其中一个人被从受伤的马背上摔下来摔断了脖子而死，而胜利者则娶了他们共同爱慕的女士。许多年后，这位已经退休的骑手在深夜回家的路上，看到一个骑手骑在山上。骑手在月亮前的剪影，但他可以看到骑手自己的头只是一个马的头骨，他的眼睛像蜡烛一样发光。",
	"Terrified, the man realized he was being haunted by the opponent he had jousted with many years earlier, and he ran home to his wife. Finding his wife at her dressing table, the husband tried to explain in a panic that she needed to hide him. Not knowing what else to do, the woman took one of her dresses and threw it on her husband, before hiding his head with one of her veils. Moments later, the doors burst open with a terrifying screech of a nightmare horse. Husband and wife alike both screamed and cowered. However, not recognizing his rival in disguise, the undead rider left to continue his search elsewhere. They say that every year, even centuries after his rival has died, the undead rider returns to the world of the living in search of revenge. Each time the undead rider crosses over into the world of the living, he brings with him many souls who long to see loved ones they miss, or who crave resolution to unfinished business. Even if these ghosts mean no ill will, their mere presence is a danger to mortals, so living mortals have started a tradition of disguising themselves on the night of Soultide so that those seeking them can't find them.": "这名男子吓坏了，意识到他被多年前与他比武的对手缠住了，于是他跑回家找他的妻子。发现他的妻子在她的梳妆台前，丈夫惊慌地试图解释她需要隐藏他。由于不知道还能做什么，这个女人拿起她的一件衣服扔到她丈夫身上，然后用她的一件面纱遮住他的头。几分钟后，大门突然打开，发出噩梦般的可怕尖叫声。丈夫和妻子都尖叫起来，畏缩不前。然而，由于没有认出他伪装的对手，这个不死的骑手离开了，继续在其他地方寻找。他们说，每年，甚至在他的对手死后的几个世纪，不死骑士都会回到活人的世界，寻找复仇的机会。每次亡灵骑士穿越到活人世界，他都会带来许多灵魂，他们渴望看到他们所想念的亲人，或者渴望解决未完成的事情。即使这些鬼魂没有恶意，他们的存在对凡人来说也是一种危险，所以活着的凡人已经开始了一个传统，即在Soultide之夜伪装自己，以便那些寻找他们的人无法找到他们。",
	"As the sun goes down on Soultide, anyone brave enough to go outside does so wearing a costume. Originally, crossdressing was the norm, but more creative costumes have come into popularity, such as mummers, adventurers, a variety of masks, or even dressing as ghosts themselves. Nobles began to throw costume parties where they'd gather with friends to eat, have drinks, and tell horror stories; this tradition would eventually make its way to common households as well.": "当太阳在Soultide下山时，任何有胆量到外面去的人都会穿上服装。最初，变装是常态，但更有创意的服装已经开始流行，例如莫默尔人、冒险家、各种面具，甚至自己装扮成鬼。贵族们开始举办化装舞会，他们会和朋友们聚在一起吃饭、喝酒、讲恐怖故事；这一传统最终也会进入普通家庭。",
	"The safety of costumes and the likelihood for many houses to be empty at night, gave way to the tradition of children playing tricks on adults, ranging from minor vandalism to boobytrapped doors and gates. Children began knocking on doors to make certain a home owner was not present before pulling their prank, and if any adult were to answer, the disguised children would demand a small ransom, otherwise they'd pull a trick on the household. Feigning a great fright, many adults acquiesced to the demand, and would give children small pastries, treats, or a few copper coins. This tradition became known as \"trick or treat\".": "服装的安全性和许多房子在晚上可能是空的，这让孩子们对成年人进行恶作剧的传统成为可能，从轻微的破坏行为到诱杀门和门的陷阱。孩子们开始敲门，以确定屋主不在，然后再进行恶作剧，如果有成人应答，伪装的孩子们就会索要小额赎金，否则他们就会对这家人进行恶作剧。许多成年人假装非常害怕，默许了这个要求，并会给孩子们小糕点、点心或几个铜币。这一传统被称为 \"不给钱就捣蛋\"。",
	"At midnight, celebrants travel to the nearest body of water (a river, lake, pond, etc), bringing candles and small wooden boats with paper coverings. Removing their masks and disguises by the edge of the water, they light the candles and set the paper lanterns afloat on the water. This act is intended to provide the wandering ghosts of their loved ones with a light to lead them home to the realm of the dead, lest they be trapped in the mortal world for the rest of the year.": "午夜时分，庆祝者前往最近的水体（河流、湖泊、池塘等），带上蜡烛和带纸罩的小木船。在水边摘下面具和伪装，他们点燃蜡烛，将纸灯笼漂浮在水面上。这一行为是为了给他们所爱的人的游魂提供一盏灯，引导他们回家，回到亡灵的领域，以免他们在一年的剩余时间里被困在凡间。",
	"Traditional decorative colors of Soultide include orange, black, purple, and vivid pink. A number of decorative traditions have spawned surrounding Soultide, but they may vary between locales. Recalling the tale of the undead rider who's head was a horse's skull, some houses decorate their doorways or their fireplace mantles with fake humanoid skulls, believing the undead rider will be driven away in jealousy. These skulls, often made of clay or wood, are sometimes painted or decorated with ribbons and flowers to lighten the macabre aesthetic. In households that cannot afford such frivolous decor, it is common for pumpkins or other gourds to be carved with faces, and used in place of skulls.": "Soultide的传统装饰颜色包括橙色、黑色、紫色和鲜艳的粉红色。围绕着Soultide产生了一些装饰传统，但它们在不同的地方可能有所不同。回顾不死骑士的故事，他的头是一个马的头骨，一些房子用假的人形头骨装饰他们的门口或壁炉罩，相信不死骑士会因为嫉妒而被赶走。这些头骨通常由粘土或木头制成，有时被涂上油漆或用丝带和鲜花装饰，以减轻可怕的美感。在买不起这种轻浮装饰的家庭中，常见的是在南瓜或其他葫芦上刻上脸，用来代替头骨。",
	"Though there is not a particular type of food that is traditionally served for Soultide dinner, many households prepare a variety of small treats that can be handed out to ward off mischievous children. This can be as simple as apples or pears, but some households bake small pastries or hand out bags of roasted nuts and seeds.": "虽然在传统上没有一种特定的食物被用于灵魂节晚餐，但许多家庭准备了各种小点心，可以分发出去，以抵御调皮的孩子。这可以是简单的苹果或梨，但有些家庭会烘烤小糕点或分发烤坚果和种子的袋子。",
	"A village of half-orcs live in a mountainous region. They tell tales that long ago, a village of humans had settled at the base of their mountain, but they were being preyed upon by bandits and thieves. As the harvest season was coming to an end, the human village feared that they would not have enough supplies to make it through the winter. Little did they know, a tribe of orcs in the mountains above were suffering an equally lean hunting season.": "一个半兽人的村庄生活在一个山区。他们讲述了这样一个故事：很久以前，一个人类村落在他们的山脚下定居，但他们被强盗和小偷所掠夺。由于收获季节即将结束，这个人类村庄担心他们没有足够的物资来度过冬天。他们不知道，山上的兽人部落正遭受着同样不景气的狩猎季节。",
	"One day, the orcs mounted a raid on the human village, not knowing that they were already besieged by a band of thieves. The orcs frightened the thieves, allowing the villagers to fight back and run the band out of town. The orcs were impressed by the uncharacteristic bravery of the human farmers, and when the humans offered what was left of their harvest to the orcs out of gratitude (or perhaps begging them not to slaughter them too), the orcs were surprised to see how many crops the humans had cultivated in the rocky terrain. Though orcs generally believed other races to be beneath them, the tribe also knew that they were unlikely to survive the coming winter in their current state.": "有一天，兽人袭击了人类的村庄，却不知道他们已经被一伙盗贼围困了。兽人惊吓了盗贼，使村民们得以反击，并将盗贼团赶出了小镇。兽人对人类农民一反常态的勇敢印象深刻，当人类出于感激将他们剩下的收获献给兽人时（也许是求他们不要把他们也宰了），兽人惊讶地看到人类在岩石地带种植了这么多作物。虽然兽人普遍认为其他种族的地位在他们之下，但部落也知道，以他们目前的状态，不太可能在即将到来的冬天生存。",
	"The orcish tribal leader, and the mayor of the small farming town, struck a temporary agreement to share in their resources for the winter. In addition, humans taught orcs their methods of raising livestock and growing crops in the rocky terrain, and orcs in turn taught humans new hunting techniques. By the time spring came, the two groups had formed a tightly knit joint-community.The modern half-orc village still has a few venerable old human men and women who remember what it was like to have orcish neighbors when they were small children, but since orcs seldom live past the age of 45, the orcish traditions are upheld entirely by their half-orc descendants. Every year at the end of the harvest season, they hold a communal feast in the town hall, celebrating the gathering of people together what the locals call, somewhat unimaginatively, Gathering Day.": "兽人部落的首领和小农镇的镇长达成了一项临时协议，分享他们的资源过冬。此外，人类向兽人传授了他们在岩石地带饲养牲畜和种植作物的方法，而兽人也向人类传授了新的狩猎技术。现代的半兽人村庄仍有一些可敬的人类老人，他们还记得小时候有兽人邻居的感觉，但由于兽人很少活过45岁，兽人的传统完全由他们的半兽人后代来维护。每年收获季节结束时，他们都会在市政厅举行公共宴会，庆祝人们聚集在一起，当地人称之为 \"聚会日\"，有点匪夷所思。",
	"The day is celebrated with farming contests to see who's cultivated the largest produce or raised the best livestock, as well as archery contests and hunting competitions. Shortly before dinner a customary \"bandit attack\" is carried out by some of the village's teenagers and young adults, who are run off by \"the bravest\" children of the village. In their community, the transition from a child who runs off the bandits, to playing one of the bandits, is considered a marker of when a boy or girl becomes a young man or woman, and coincides with additional privileges and responsibilities they'll take on in the coming seasons.": "这一天的庆祝活动包括农事比赛，看谁种植的农产品最大或饲养的牲畜最好，以及射箭比赛和打猎比赛。晚饭前不久，村里的一些青少年和年轻人按惯例进行 \"土匪袭击\"，由村里 \"最勇敢的 \"孩子把他们赶走。在他们的社区里，从跑掉土匪的孩子到扮演土匪之一，被认为是一个男孩或女孩成为年轻男人或女人的标志，并与他们在未来的季节里将承担的额外特权和责任相吻合。",
	"Though decor is not considered of chief importance to the holiday, it's not uncommon for baskets or crates of produce to be put on display, or for dried meats to be hung up like garlands, evoking a sense of plentifulness.": "虽然装饰并不被认为是节日的主要重点，但把一篮子或一箱子的农产品摆出来，或把干肉像花环一样挂起来，唤起人们对丰收的感觉，也是很常见的。",
	"Though much of the food from the harvest will be treated and preserved to last through the winter, the communal feast attempts to serve a wide variety of dishes. Every household provides some part, and many hold an informal competition to bring the best pies, pickles, roasted vegetables, and roasted meats at the feast.": "虽然大部分收获的食物会被处理和保存，以持续到冬季，但公共宴会试图提供各种各样的菜肴。每家每户都提供一些部分，许多家庭举行非正式的比赛，以便在宴会上带来最好的馅饼、腌制食品、烤蔬菜和烤肉。",
	"At first glance, many westerners will recognize this holiday as being analogous to Christmas, but in truth, it's actually patterned after Yuletide. Though the Feast Of The Wild Hunt not associated with any specific religious figures in this iteration, you're welcome to make modifications to bring it closer to the base of Christmas or Yuletide if you prefer. If you're using a calendar that is analogous to the western calendar, the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will begin on the 20th day of the 12th month, and end on the 31st, meaning it will coincide with any potential New Year's Eve celebrations. An \"either-or\" approach is recommended, as stacking holidays or placing a New Year's Day holiday immediately after this 12day feast will be excessive and/or exhausting.": "乍一看，许多西方人会认为这个节日类似于圣诞节，但事实上，它实际上是以圣诞为模式。虽然在这个版本中，狂猎节与任何特定的宗教人物都没有关系，但如果你愿意，欢迎你进行修改，使其更接近圣诞节或余暇节的基础。如果你使用的是与西方日历相似的日历，狂猎节将从12月20日开始，在31日结束，这意味着它将与任何可能的除夕庆祝活动相吻合。建议采用 \"非此即彼 \"的方法，因为在这12天的盛宴之后立即叠加假期或安排元旦假期将是过度的和/或疲惫的。",
	"This twelve-day festival begins on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and celebrates the tradition that a party of ghostly (or perhaps divine) hunters rides through the woods in search of great prey during this season. It is believed that this \"wild hunt\" also sweeps up all of the remnants of dead souls of the year and brings them along as servants on the hunt, ending times of mourning. The wild hunt serves an important purpose, bringing a close to the end of the year and starting anew.": "这个为期12天的节日始于冬至，即一年中最短的一天，并庆祝这样一个传统：在这个季节，一队幽灵般的（或许是神圣的）猎人骑马穿过森林，寻找伟大的猎物。人们相信，这个 \"野猎 \"也会扫除一年中所有死去的灵魂的残余，并把它们作为猎物的仆人带在身边，结束哀悼的时间。野外狩猎有一个重要的目的，为一年的结束和新的开始画上句号。",
	"It is customary that no work is done during the twelve day festival; while this does not mean that every business closes (healers, inns, and general stores often stay open in at least a limited capacity), people hurry to get many jobs finished before the festival, such as cutting wood, works of crafting, sewing, etc. Some believe that disaster awaits those who have not completed their work before the festival, and they may even be swept up along with the dead souls and taken by the wild hunt. The Feast Of The Wild Hunt makes for a busy travelling season, as celebrants will often try to return to their family home to celebrate. Though arriving by sunset on the first day of the festival is ideal, work obligations and heavily snowed-in roads make this a difficult proposition for many. As such, visitors tend to trickle in during all twelve days of the feast. Some households who don't have extended family or aren't expecting guests will open their doors to travellers during the season, providing shelter for those who haven't yet completed their journeys. Though all twelve days are considered part of the holiday, four days in particular have noteworthy customs.": "按照惯例，在十二天的节日里不做任何工作；虽然这并不意味着每家企业都关门（医士、旅馆和普通商店往往至少在有限的范围内保持营业），但人们赶在节日前完成许多工作，如砍柴、手工制作、缝纫等。有些人认为，灾难正等待着那些在节日前没有完成工作的人，他们甚至可能与死去的灵魂一起被卷走，被野猎带走。荒野狩猎节是一个繁忙的旅行季节，因为庆祝者往往会设法回到他们的家来庆祝。虽然在节日的第一天日落前到达是最理想的，但工作的义务和严重积雪的道路使许多人难以做到这一点。因此，游客往往会在节日的所有12天内陆续到来。一些没有大家庭或不期待客人的家庭会在这个季节向旅行者敞开大门，为那些尚未完成旅行的人提供住所。虽然所有12天都被认为是节日的一部分，但有四天特别有值得注意的习俗。",
	"The wild hunt begins, and everyone completes their work by sunset, with no intent to resume until the festival has ended. On this day, it is customary for households to gift their friends and loved ones with logs for their hearths, to keep them burning for all twelve days of the festival. Very large and dry logs are prized gifts, and may be kept and prepared for months before the Feast Of The Wild Hunt. Many people will also keep bundles of small dry sticks and twigs tied with cord (often gathered by the household's children) to give as gifts to acquaintances. Roadside vendors will sell bundles of split firewood decorated with ribbons, holly, mistletoe, and pine needles to be purchased for gifting when travellers return home as guests. This is considered a time for welcoming guests, and households will often bake fresh bread or keep pots of spiced cider over their fires, letting the welcoming scents of the season waft out to draw their travellers home.": "野外狩猎开始了，每个人都在日落前完成他们的工作，在节日结束前没有人打算继续工作。在这一天，家家户户都习惯于给朋友和亲人的壁炉送上原木，让他们在节日的所有12天里一直燃烧。非常大和干燥的原木是珍贵的礼物，可以在野猎节前保存和准备几个月。许多人还会保留一捆用绳索捆绑的小干树枝和树枝（通常是由家庭的孩子收集），作为礼物送给熟人。路边的小贩会出售一捆捆用丝带、冬青、槲寄生和松针装饰的劈开的木柴，当旅行者作为客人回家时，可以买来送人。这被认为是一个欢迎客人的时刻，家庭往往会烘烤新鲜的面包或在火堆上放上一壶香料苹果酒，让这个季节的欢迎气味飘散出来，吸引他们的旅客回家。",
	"The last night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt, and on this night, the wild hunt takes with them the dead old year itself, allowing a new year to be ushered in. The last of the food and drink from the feasting is to be finished off, and it's considered bad luck to leave any leftovers. Any oaths made on this night are considered of the utmost importance, and for this reason, many people will propose marriage during this last night of celebration. Many oaths of love, friendship, brotherhood and sisterhood, devotion, or protection are made on the last night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt, and everyone endeavours to enter into the new year with a clean conscience and a bright outlook on the future.": "狂猎节的最后一晚，在这个夜晚，狂猎带着死去的旧年本身，让新的一年迎来了。宴席上最后的食物和饮料都要吃完，留下任何残羹剩饭都被认为是坏运气。在这个夜晚作出的任何誓言都被认为是最重要的，为此，许多人将在这最后一个庆祝之夜提出结婚。许多关于爱情、友谊、兄弟姐妹情谊、奉献或保护的誓言都是在狂欢节的最后一夜作出的，每个人都努力以干净的良心和对未来的美好展望进入新的一年。",
	"The twelfth night of the Feast Of The Wild Hunt is considered the last night of the year, therefore, functions as New Year's Eve. Locales that celebrate the Feast Of The Wild Hunt will usually not celebrate an additional New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.": "狂猎节的第十二个晚上被认为是一年中的最后一个晚上，因此，作为除夕的功能。庆祝狂猎节的地区通常不会再庆祝除夕或元旦。",
	"Natural plants like oak wood, pine needles and pine cones, holly, and mistletoe are considered emblematic of the season, and snow is a natural occurrence. As such, the traditional colors of the feast are brown, green, red, and white, and many will incorporate these colors into their household linens, clothes, etc. Candles are often made of red or green wax for use during the holiday season": "橡树木、松针和松果、冬青和槲寄生等天然植物被认为是这个季节的象征，而雪是一种自然现象。因此，宴席的传统颜色是棕色、绿色、红色和白色，许多人会将这些颜色融入他们的家纺、衣服等。蜡烛通常由红色或绿色的蜡制成，在节日期间使用。",
	"Feasting is considered a major part of the holiday. The most traditional foods are wild boar, goose, and goat. Drinking is also considered a popular part of the celebration, and spiced hot cider is a tradition found far and wide. Nearly every household has their own family recipe for spiced cider. This is a time of year when many special treats are made, that would normally be considered too extravagant to serve on a normal basis. Pastries, cakes, pies, and other sweets are common treats of the season.": "宴会被认为是节日的一个主要部分。最传统的食物是野猪肉、鹅肉和山羊。饮酒也被认为是庆祝活动的一个受欢迎的部分，五香热苹果酒是一个广泛存在的传统。几乎每家每户都有自己的五香苹果酒配方。每年的这个时候都会有许多特殊的食物被制作出来，这些食物通常被认为是太奢侈了，无法在正常情况下供应。糕点、蛋糕、馅饼和其他甜食是这个季节常见的食物。",

I will repeatedly remind and encourage you to be as imaginative as possible throughout this supplement, and provide short examples which I hope inspire you to create fantastical tavern games for you and your players! Of course, I encourage Dungeon Masters to adapt these games in order to make them more appropriate for your game and your players.": "我的玩家对在当地酒馆里玩游戏有一种永不满足的欲望。这本小补编是在他们享受分布在我们整个战役中的酒馆里的各种技巧游戏的过程中诞生的。这些游戏有些是我生活中流行的游戏的幻想改编，有些是我个人对听说过或读过的酒馆游戏的理解。这些构成了我在活动中实施的最受欢迎和最成功的游戏，我希望你和你的玩家喜欢它们。请记住，这些游戏的成功完全取决于你和你的玩家对事件的叙述能力--不要害怕增加悬念，或者描述遭遇的细节 我将反复提醒并鼓励你在本补编中尽可能地发挥想象力，并提供一些简短的例子，我希望这些例子能够激励你为你和你的玩家创造出幻想中的酒馆游戏 当然，我鼓励地下城主改编这些游戏，以便使它们更适合你的游戏和你的玩家。",
	"A burly dragonborn, sweat on his brow, is locked fist-in-fist with a grinning halfling clad in various furs. The bar is loud with cheers and clinking glasses as the two are stuck in a stalemate. Their eyes narrowed at one another over their trembling clenched fists. Suddenly, the halfling lets loose a barbaric shout and slams the fist of the dragonborn onto the scarred wooden table. A chorus of cheers go up behind the halfling and she winks at the astonished dragonborn before waltzing to the bar.": "一个魁梧的龙裔，额头上的汗水，正与一个身穿各种皮草的半身人拳脚相加。当两人陷入僵局时，酒吧里响起了欢呼声和碰杯声。他们的眼睛在颤抖的拳头上互相眯着。突然，半身人发出一声野蛮的叫喊，将龙裔的拳头砸在有疤痕的木桌上。半身人身后响起了一片欢呼声，她向惊愕的龙裔眨了眨眼，然后向酒吧走去。",
	"Arm wrestling is a classic, two-person contest of strength! If the player is competing against an NPC, be sure to describe the opponent. Is it a goblin trapper with a humorously large left bicep? Is it a burly human guard? Or maybe a seemingly wimpy elf who turns out to be a barbarian that rages during the contest? Be creative!": "掰手腕是一种经典的、两人的力量较量! 如果玩家的对手是NPC，一定要描述对手。是一个有着幽默的大左二头肌的地精捕手？是一个粗壮的人类警卫吗？或者是一个看似懦弱的精灵，结果是一个在比赛中暴怒的野蛮人？请发挥你的创造力!",
	"The two contestants undergo a contest of strength by making a series of opposing Strength checks from an even starting position. There are two positions past the starting position on each side, and upon losing a check at the second position, a contestant must succeed on a strength saving throw against the winning contestant's Strength score or be tapped out.": "两位参赛者从一个均匀的起始位置开始，进行一系列对立的力量检查，进行力量的较量。每一方都有两个位置超过起始位置，在第二个位置检查失败后，参赛者必须对获胜者的力量得分进行力量储蓄投掷，否则将被淘汰。",
	"A natural 20 on a strength check moves a contestant forward by two positions and a natural 20 on a strength saving throw returns them to the starting position. A natural 1 on a strength check moves a contestant backwards by two positions.": "力量检查的自然值为20时，参赛者向前移动两个位置，力量救球的自然值为20时，则返回到起始位置。力量检查的自然数为1时，参赛者向后移动两个位置。",
	"Let's examine these mechanics from the above example of Layla the halfling and Reynard the dragonborn. They roll a opposing strength checks from a starting position. Layla rolls a 12 and Reynard rolls a 15, so Reynard is able to muster the will to push Layla's arm into the next position. However, on the next check, Layla rolls a Natural 20 against Reynard's 16! Layla hunkers down and, with a burst of strength, is able to push Reynard back to the starting position- and then down to the next position on the opposite side. On the next throw, Reyard rolls a 12 against Layla's 10, and now the two are once more evenly matched in the center. At this point, Layla enters her Barbarian Rage, conferring advantage on her Strength checks, and allowing her to beat Reynard in the next two checks, pushing Reynard into the second position. Here Reynard flubs yet another Strength check and proceeds to make a Strength saving throw, where he rolls an 11. Unfortunately for him, Layla is a beefy halfling with a Strength score of 14, meaning that he fails his saving throw and Layla is able to slam Reynard's fist to the table amid a chorus of cheers!": "让我们从上述半身人莱拉和龙裔雷纳德的例子中来研究这些机制。他们在开始的位置上掷出一个对立的力量检查。莱拉掷出12分，雷纳德掷出15分，所以雷纳德能够鼓起意志将莱拉的手臂推到下一个位置。然而，在下一次检查中，莱拉掷出了自然20分，而雷纳德掷出了16分！莱拉蜷缩着身子，并将手伸向了雷纳德。莱拉蜷缩着身体，用一股力量将雷纳德推回到起始位置--然后再推到对面的下一个位置。在下一次投掷中，雷纳德掷出了12，而雷拉掷出了10，现在两人又一次在中间势均力敌。这时，莱拉进入了她的野蛮人之怒，赋予她力量检查的优势，并允许她在接下来的两次检查中击败雷纳德，将雷纳德推到第二位。在这里，雷纳德又一次搞砸了力量检查，并继续进行力量储蓄，他掷出了11分。不幸的是，莱拉是个强壮的半身人，力量值为14，这意味着他的蓄力失败，莱拉能够在一片欢呼声中把雷纳德的拳头摔到桌子上。",
	"It is possible for these contests to go on for some time. If an arm wrestling competition goes on for six checks (or you see the players begin to lose interest), have any contestants who are not proficient in arm wrestling make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of the opponent's Strength score. If a contestant fails, they gain disadvantage for the remainder of the contest. Any NPC who the DM deems to be an experienced arm wrestler may have profiency in arm wrestling, and a player may gain proficiency in arm wrestling by winning 10 arm wrestling matches within a week!": "这些比赛有可能会持续一段时间。如果掰手腕的比赛持续了六次（或者你看到选手们开始失去兴趣），让任何不精通掰手腕的选手用对手的力量值的DC来进行宪法拯救。如果参赛者失败了，他们在比赛的剩余时间里就会处于劣势。任何被DM认为是有经验的摔跤手的NPC都可以拥有摔跤的能力，而玩家在一周内赢得10场摔跤比赛，就可以获得摔跤的熟练度。",
	"This is a simple gambling game that involves the racing of squirrels, or any other creature of the DM's choosing. Be sure to describe the clientele in the room and the animals themselves! Is this a game that the upper class like to play? Or is it illegal, backroom gambling that occurs in a seedy tavern with the middle or lower class?": "这是一个简单的赌博游戏，涉及到松鼠的比赛，或DM选择的任何其他生物。一定要描述房间里的顾客和动物本身的情况! 这是一个上流社会喜欢玩的游戏吗？还是发生在中产阶级或下层阶级的肮脏小酒馆里的非法、暗室赌博？",
	"Give each squirrel a name like Twitch (a squirrel which moves spasmodically and whose tail never rests) or Nimble (a graceful albino squirrel whose tail flicks elegantly from side to side).": "给每只松鼠取个名字，如Twitch（一种痉挛性运动的松鼠，其尾巴从不休息）或Nimble（一种优雅的白化松鼠，其尾巴优雅地从一侧甩到另一侧）。",
	"Each player selects a squirrel and places a bet that either matches or exceeds the minimum bet. This minimum bet will differ based on where the game is being played! While the rich may start at 10 gold, more common folk may start at 2 copper. Each player then rolls a d20 to see how many inches forwards their chosen squirrel travels in each round. If multiple players choose the same squirrel, have them alternate who makes the check.": "每位玩家选择一只松鼠并下注，赌注要符合或超过最低赌注。这个最低赌注将根据游戏地点的不同而不同! 有钱人可以从10金开始，而更多的普通人可以从2铜开始。然后每个玩家掷一个D20，看他们选择的松鼠在每一轮中向前走多少英寸。如果多个玩家选择同一只松鼠，让他们轮流做检查。",
	"The first squirrel to either travel the farthest in five rounds or travel 75 inches wins! A Natural 20 is 25 inches and a Natural 1 is moving backwards or off track by 5 inches.": "第一个在五个回合中走得最远的松鼠或走了75英寸的松鼠获胜! 自然20是25英寸，自然1是向后移动或偏离轨道5英寸。",
	"One way you could spice up a tavern or a game of squirrel racing is by having the bookie \"forget\" the bets made by the players and try to cheat them out of their full winnings, or try to run with the players money. A bookie may do this if they owe money to an underground organization or crime family, or if they're simply greedy!": "你可以给酒馆或松鼠赛跑游戏加点料的方法是，让赌徒 \"忘记 \"玩家下的赌注，试图骗取他们的全部赢利，或试图带着玩家的钱跑路。如果赌徒欠了地下组织或犯罪家族的钱，或者他们只是贪婪，就可能会这样做",
	" This is a 2-4 player gambling game that is based on a simple game of darts. Again, be sure to describe the contestants and the clientele. Maybe the players are competing with kobolds in The Short Stack, a tavern designed for a clientele of belowaverage height (gnomes, dwarves, & kobolds)? Or maybe a pair of half-orc pirates in a seaside tavern called Captain's Crust?": " 这是一个2-4人的赌博游戏，是基于一个简单的飞镖游戏。同样，一定要描述参赛者和顾客的情况。也许玩家是在 \"矮人堆 \"中与哥布林竞争，这个酒馆是为身高低于平均水平的顾客设计的（地精、矮人和哥布林）？或者是一对半兽人海盗在一家名为 \"船长的地壳 \"的海边酒馆里竞争？",
	"Each player must make a dexterity attack roll with a dart against a dartboard with an AC of 10. After the first round, each player has the opportunity to raise their bet. After two more rounds of dart throws, the player with the most points (as determined by the success of their dart throws) takes the pot! The players earn points by their attack roll as follows:": "每个选手必须用飞镖对AC为10的镖靶进行灵巧的攻击卷。在第一轮之后，每个选手都有机会提高他们的赌注。再经过两轮投掷飞镖后，得分最多的选手（根据他们投掷飞镖的成功率决定的）就可以获得奖金。选手通过他们的攻击卷获得分数，如下所示。",
	"1-9: the dart misses the board entirely, and may even hit another patron or a light source. No points.": "1-9：飞镖完全没有击中镖靶，甚至可能击中其他的观众或光源。不得分。",
	"10-12: the dart hits the outermost ring and earns a single point.": "10-12：飞镖击中最外层的环，获得一个分数。",
	"13-16: the dart hits the middle ring and earns two points.": "13-16：飞镖击中中间的环，获得两分。",
	"17+: the dart hits the center ring and earns three points.": "17+：飞镖击中中心环，获得三分。",
	"20 (or any other critical hit): the dart hits dead-center in the bullsheart and the player earns five points!": "20（或任何其他关键的命中）：飞镖击中了牛心的正中，选手获得5分！这是最重要的。",
	"Note that players proficient in darts, a simple ranged weapon, may use their proficiency bonus in this game, but any NPCs who play bullsheart regularly may also use their proficiency bonus, at the DMs discretion. Maybe the tavern Bullsheart champion would have a proficiency bonus as high as +5, and local hunters would certainly have a bonus of at least +2!": "注意，精通飞镖这种简单的远程武器的玩家可以在这个游戏中使用他们的熟练度奖励，但是任何经常玩牛心的NPC也可以使用他们的熟练度奖励，由DM决定。也许酒馆里的牛心冠军会有高达+5的熟练度奖励，而当地的猎人肯定会有至少+2的奖励。",
	"This is a simple drinking game for two players. As always, describe the contestants! Who is the challenger: a blind dwarf with the nose of a bloodhound? A surprisingly hearty human teenager? A quest-giver who will only acknowledge the strength of the party and confer missions to them if one of the players manages to beat the quest-giver at a drinking game?": "这是一个简单的饮酒游戏，适合两名玩家。像往常一样，描述一下参赛者的情况! 谁是挑战者：一个有着猎犬鼻子的盲人侏儒？一个出乎意料的酣畅淋漓的人类少年？一个只有在其中一个玩家设法在喝酒游戏中击败任务执行者时才会承认他们的实力并授予他们任务的任务执行者？",
	"Six to eight beers are purchased and placed on the bar or table where the participants are playing. Each contestant will have to chug the beers as quickly as possible, requiring them to make Constitution checks with increasing difficulty depending on the number of beers they have drunk:": "购买六到八瓶啤酒，放在参赛者进行比赛的吧台或桌子上。每位参赛者要尽可能快地灌下啤酒，要求他们根据喝下的啤酒数量，进行难度不断增加的宪法检查。",

	"The two participants (or each pair of participants) stand 6 ft. apart and one player throws a battleaxe to thier partner, who must make a dexterity check to catch it. If the partner is able to successfully catch the battleaxe, the battleaxe is tossed back to the first player, who makes their own dexterity check.

The last player left must drink the ale in order to earn the gold in the bottom (just for flavor, no check required unless the DM sees fit).
