You need just one thing to start your own tavern: gumption! It also doesn't hurt to have something you're known for, like an underground portal to riches and fame. A gimmick, I guess. So, that's gumption and a gimmick, which sometimes helps with naming the endeavor. Mine's pretty apparent, right? When I emerged from that hole in the ground with my earnings, there was nothing but cattlepie as far as the eye could see. I hired some folk and got to building. Hmm, I suppose that's three things; gumption, a gimmick, and gold. We'll call them the three G's.": "老爷们会说你需要各种东西来建立一个成功的企业。那是蟑螂蛋。他们只是想阻止你成为竞争对手。你只需要一样东西来开创你自己的酒馆：魄力! 有一些你出名的东西也无妨，比如通往财富和名声的地下入口。我想，这是一个噱头。所以，这就是魄力和噱头，这有时有助于为努力的方向命名。我的很明显，对吗？当我带着我的收入从那个地洞里走出来时，眼睛所能看到的只有牛粪。我雇了一些人，开始了建设。嗯，我想这是三件事；勇气、噱头和黄金。我们称它们为三个 \"G\"。",

	"The Yawning Portal is perhaps the most famous tavern in all the Forgotten Realms. Located in the Castle Ward of the city of Waterdeep, the establishment is named after the large well in its common room–the tip of a sunken stone tower–which descends into the mazelike dungeon of Undermountain. Treasure seekers from across the Realms meet in the inn's taproom to plan their own delves, making it the perfect place to start an adventure!": "打哈欠的门也许是所有被遗忘的领域中最著名的酒馆。它位于沃特迪普城的城堡区，因其公共房间里的一口大井而得名--这口井是一座下沉的石塔的顶端，可以通往地下山迷宫般的地宫。来自整个王国的寻宝者在客栈的酒水间会面，计划他们自己的探索，使其成为开始冒险的完美场所",

Today, the apparently ageless adventurer dares his patrons to enter the dungeon below and claim their own destiny!": "打哈欠的门是由臭名昭著的冒险家杜南在公元1306年建造的，他用自己远征地下山时抢来的财宝创建了这家旅馆。杜南后来回到了疯狂巫师的迷宫中，把生意留给了他的家人，但在近一个世纪后，他又回到了这里，收回了他的财产。今天，这位显然不老的冒险家敢于让他的顾客进入下面的地牢，要求他们自己的命运",

This potent potable has garnered fine imbibers from as far away as Sharn and the southern coast of Khorvaire. Such demand keeps the distillers extremely busy, so they've simplified their in-house sales down to just the one drink.": "酒厂是斯托姆雷奇最大的雇主之一，这在很大程度上是由于他们的主要产品--一种名为库尔维亚的杜松子酒--的知名度大增。这种烈性酒获得了来自遥远的沙恩和霍尔韦尔南岸的优质饮用者。这样的需求让酿酒师们非常忙碌，所以他们把内部销售简化到只有一种饮料。",
	"Even so, few people choose to drink the sickly-sweet smelling liquor direct from the distillery.

	"My loiter-sack companion Mirt plays this game when he goes out drinking (so, that's most nights). The rules are simple. Down at least one drink in every tavern you visit, get barred from as many premises as you can, and tug the beard of every second dwarf you see. Whoever scores the most gets a free pass on the next pub crawl. I don't think that old cumberwold has ever been beat, but I've an inkling it's because he secretly hires longbeards to line his route": "我的闲逛袋伙伴穆特在出去喝酒的时候会玩这个游戏（所以，那是大多数晚上）。规则很简单。在你去的每家酒馆里至少喝上一杯，尽可能多地被禁止进入酒馆，并拽住你看到的每一个矮人的胡须。得分最多的人可以免费参加下一次的酒馆爬行活动。我不认为老康伯沃德曾经被打败过，但我隐约感觉到这是因为他秘密地雇用长胡子来排列他的路线。",

	"The Inn of the Welcome Wench is situated in the village of Hommlet in the world of Greyhawk.

Due in large part to its rib-sticking fare (the poached salmon is amazing), comfortable lodgings, and reasonable prices for both, the inn is a well-known respite for adventurers.": "迎宾女巫旅馆位于灰鹰世界中的霍姆雷特村。欢迎女巫旅馆长期以来一直由贡迪古特家族拥有，是霍姆雷特的社交中心；几乎每个人都会在一天中的某个时刻经过它的大门，无论是早餐、午餐，还是在一天的辛苦工作之后喝一杯。在很大程度上，由于它的肋骨美食（水煮三文鱼令人惊叹）、舒适的住宿和合理的价格，该旅馆是一个著名的冒险家的休息场所。",
	"The Welcome Wench is a sprawling edifice of stone bricks and thick wooden timbers. More than a dozen stone chimneys jut from the slate roof, with thin curls of smoke drifting away in the breeze. Inside is a large common area complete with a bar and a pair of private dining rooms. Stairs ascend to a second floor that sports over a dozen private and shared rooms as well as a larger private dining room.": "迎宾楼是一座由石砖和厚木头构成的庞大建筑。十多个石制烟囱从石板屋顶上伸出来，薄薄的烟卷在微风中飘散。里面是一个大的公共区域，有一个酒吧和一对私人餐厅。楼梯上升到二楼，二楼有十几间私人和共用的房间，以及一个更大的私人饭厅。",
