	"A former follower of Imzel and self-proclaimed durthan, Mishara Viadrova is a powerful wychlaran who turned against the dark order after Imzel's death and the fall of the durthan. For years, she worked alongside the lower ranks of wychlaran, shunned by her fellow casters for her involvement with the dark arts of the durthan. Through years of tireless effort and a spotless record of integrity, goodness, and obedience to the wychlaran, Mishara was slowly promoted through the ranks. Ultimately, she reached the council of the othlor and fell under the tutelage of the aging abjuration specialist, Kovorina Dvilich. Mishara endured a relatively short tutelage at the hands of Kovorina, mastering protective magics and the communal binding capabilities that other wychlaran could scarcely imagine. After Kovorina's death shortly thereafter, the othlor selected Mishara—the only qualified candidate who could replace Kovorina on the council—to join the inner circle of othlor.": "米莎拉-维阿卓瓦（Mishara Viadrova）曾是伊姆泽尔（Imzel）的追随者，并自称是杜尔坦（durthan）人，她是一个强大的维克拉伦（wychlaran），在伊姆泽尔去世和杜尔坦衰落后，她转而反对黑暗秩序。多年来，她与低级别的巫师一起工作，因为参与了黑暗的杜尔坦艺术而被她的同伴们所回避。通过多年的不懈努力，以及在正直、善良和服从巫师方面的无懈可击的记录，米莎拉慢慢地在等级上得到了提升。最终，她进入了Othlor委员会，并在年迈的禁欲专家Kovorina Dvilich的指导下工作。米沙拉在科沃里纳的手中忍受了相对较短的辅导时间，掌握了保护性的魔法和其他威赫拉伦几乎无法想象的公共约束能力。此后不久，科沃里纳去世后，奥特莱斯选择了米沙拉--唯一可以取代科沃里纳在理事会中的合格候选人，加入奥特莱斯的内部圈子。",
	"When Mishara became an othlor, she carved a new mask in the shape of a wolf's visage: a symbol of her rebirth and the loyal ferocity with which she would protect the wychlaran and Rashemen from the forces of darkness that threatened to destabilize the nation. But every mask has two sides and ultimately acts as a disguise to show the world only what the wearer wishes them to see. While Mishara is dedicated to the protection of the order, she regularly employs contacts from her durthan past and other unsavory magical methods the wychlaran would not approve of in order to ensure the protection of the realm. Her position in the othlor places her above scrutiny, allowing her actions to go unchecked.": "当米沙拉成为一名奥斯陆人时，她雕刻了一个狼脸形状的新面具：象征着她的重生，以及她将保护维奇兰人和拉希曼人免受威胁到国家稳定的黑暗势力的影响的忠诚的凶猛。但每个面具都有两面性，最终作为一种伪装，只向世界展示佩戴者希望他们看到的东西。虽然米沙拉致力于保护教团，但她经常使用来自她的杜尔坦过去的联系人和其他不光彩的魔法方法，以确保对王国的保护，而这些方法是维克拉伦不会同意的。她在Othlor的地位使她凌驾于监督之上，使她的行为不受约束。",
	"Utilizing her communal binding mastery, Mishara has the ability to commune with hundreds and thousands of ants, spiders, and mites across the realm and outlying nations. These creatures act as spies and informants, allowing Mishara to collect seemingly impossible information from even the most secret of conversations. Her mastery of shared spellcasting allows her to cast spells through these insects, whether they are separated by inches or hundreds of miles. With careful focus and expert attention, Mishara secretly intervenes in dangerous situations across the realms; sometimes as a long-distance healer who saves a crucial figure from an expert assassination, other times as the magical assassin who removes a crucial threat to the Rashemi.": "利用她的公共约束力的掌握，米沙拉有能力与整个王国和外围国家的成百上千的蚂蚁、蜘蛛和螨虫交流。这些生物充当了间谍和线人的角色，使米莎拉能够从最秘密的对话中收集到看似不可能的信息。她对共享法术的掌握使她能够通过这些昆虫施放法术，无论它们相隔几英寸还是几百英里。凭借仔细的关注和专业的注意力，米莎拉秘密地介入了整个王国的危险局势；有时作为远程治疗师从专家的暗杀中拯救了一个关键人物，有时则作为魔法刺客消除了对拉希米人的关键威胁。",
	"Despite her good intentions, Mishara's connections with the underground durthan witches, immense spy network, and access to dangerous and forbidden knowledge act as constant temptations to use her powers for ill. While the othlor's rigid rules and delineation of light and dark magics have historically held the wychlaran together and ensured the safety of Rashemen, Mishara has begun to question, once again, whether these rules are the correct path forward. With ever-evolving magical forces threatening invasion from Thay and the other bordering countries, it is unclear how Rashemen could survive without wychlaran who are willing to skirt the boundaries of magical law and reshape the rules that govern the wychlaran. Mishara's alliances and connections, whether for good or ill, may shape the future of Rashemen; as great powers rise and fall, knowledge is the true magic that holds this nation together.": "尽管她的意图是好的，但米沙拉与地下杜尔坦女巫的联系、巨大的间谍网络以及对危险和禁忌知识的接触，不断地诱惑着她将自己的力量用于邪恶。虽然Othlor的严格规则和对光明与黑暗魔法的划分在历史上一直维系着wychlaran，并确保了Rashemen的安全，但Mishara已经开始再次质疑，这些规则是否是正确的前进道路。随着不断发展的魔法力量威胁着来自泰伊和其他邻国的入侵，如果没有愿意绕过魔法法则的界限、重塑管理wychlaran的规则的wychlaran，不知道拉希门如何生存。米沙拉的联盟和关系，无论好坏，都可能塑造拉希曼的未来；随着大国的兴衰，知识是维系这个国家的真正魔法。",

	"Psychic Channeling. You form a strong telepathic connection with the bonded creatures. For the duration of the channeling, all creatures within your Communal Bond can communicate telepathically, regardless of distance. The connection formed enables the affected creatures to perform more complex maneuvers by giving them awareness of what their comrades are about to do. Additionally, as a bonus action on their turn, a bonded creature can use the senses of another bonded creature instead of their own until the end of their own turn. For example, a human can gain a dwarf's darkvision.": "心灵感应。你与结合的生物形成强烈的心灵感应联系。在传导的持续时间内，在你的公共结合体中的所有生物都可以进行心灵感应，不受距离限制。形成的联系使受影响的生物能够进行更复杂的操作，因为他们能够意识到他们的同伴将要做什么。此外，作为他们回合的额外行动，一个被结合的生物可以使用另一个被结合的生物的感官，而不是他们自己的感官，直到他们自己的回合结束。例如，一个人类可以获得矮人的暗视。",

	"After choosing the form your telthor takes, you cannot change it. Your telthor acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it makes its own initiative checks and acts on its own turn. As long as you and your telthor are within 30 feet of each other, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your telthor. If it is of a suitable size, your telthor can also serve you as a mount both in and out of combat.": "在选择了你的泰瑟尔的形式后，你不能改变它。你的泰瑟尔独立于你行动，但它总是听从你的命令。在战斗中，它可以自己进行主动检查，并在自己的回合中行动。只要你和你的望远镜在30英尺范围内，你就可以让你施放的任何只针对你的法术也针对你的望远镜。如果它的尺寸合适，你的望远镜也可以在战斗中和战斗外作为你的坐骑使用。",
	"As an action, as long as you are within 100 feet of your telthor, you can see and hear through its eyes and ears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, but gain the benefits of any special senses your telthor has.": "作为一个动作，只要你在你的望远镜的100英尺范围内，你就可以通过它的眼睛和耳朵看和听，直到你下一个回合开始。在这段时间内，你对自己的感官是失聪和失明的，但可以获得你的望远镜的任何特殊感官的好处。",
	"When your telthor drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss it at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, it can be resummoned by performing a ritual during a long rest, at the end of which your telthor reappears, restored to its hit point maximum.": "当你的泰瑟尔下降到0命中率时，它就会消失，不留下任何物理形态。你也可以在任何时候将它作为一个行动来解散，使其消失。在这两种情况下，它都可以通过在长时间的休息中进行仪式来重新召唤，在仪式结束后，你的泰尔索尔会重新出现，恢复到它的最大命中率。",

	"As your knowledge of the arcane grows, your magic becomes harder for others to resist.

Once you've used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "随着你对奥术知识的增长，你的魔法对其他人来说变得更难抵御。从10级开始，每当你施放一个需要目标进行蓄力的巫师法术时，你可以选择强迫所有目标以劣势进行蓄力。一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"By 14th level, your telthor have become an irreplaceable part of your combat tactics. Whenever you cast a spell or make a weapon attack, one of your telthor can use their reaction to move up to 10 feet and make an attack against a creature within range.": "到了14级，你的泰瑟尔已经成为你战斗战术中不可替代的一部分。每当你施展法术或进行武器攻击时，你的一个泰瑟尔可以使用他们的反应来移动到10英尺，并对范围内的生物进行攻击。",
	"Rashemi culture recognizes that one individual's strength can balance another's weakness. It is not uncommon for witches to travel with a trusted companion. Witches of importance, or those charged with urgent tasks, may have companions thrust upon them by elders concerned for their safety. The wychlaran wizards recognize the benefits of such pairings and often forge long lasting relationships with those charged with their care.": "拉希米文化认识到，一个人的力量可以平衡另一个人的弱点。女巫与一个值得信赖的伙伴一起旅行是很常见的。重要的女巫，或者那些负责紧急任务的女巫，可能会有长老们担心他们的安全而把同伴推给他们。巫师们认识到这种搭配的好处，并经常与负责照顾他们的人建立长期的关系。",
	"Starting when you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you are assigned a cohort by the elders of the wychlaran. As you grow in power, so will your cohort, so that they might serve you as long as they can. When you gain this feature, choose one of the following types: arcanist, martialist, or sneak. The type you choose determines the stat blocks your cohort will use as you gain more levels in this class, as shown on the table below.": "从你2级采用这个传统开始，你就会被威赫拉伦的长老们分配到一个队友。随着你力量的增长，你的队友也会增长，这样他们就可以尽可能地服务于你。当你获得这个特性时，请从以下类型中选择一个：奥术师、武术师、或潜行者。你所选择的类型决定了当你在这个等级中获得更多等级时，你的同伙将使用的状态块，如下表所示。",
	"Your cohort must be a humanoid native of Rashemen and share at least one language with you, but you can choose or randomly select specific details such as their race or gender. Your cohort would risk their life to protect you, and follows your orders to the best of their ability. In combat, they roll their own initiative and act on their own turn. Out of combat they may run small errands or scout out an area, but they will not willingly travel more than a few miles away from the one they are sworn to protect.": "你的同伙必须是拉西门本地的人，并与你至少有一种共同语言，但你可以选择或随机选择具体细节，如他们的种族或性别。你的同伙会冒着生命危险来保护你，并尽其所能服从你的命令。在战斗中，他们滚动自己的主动权，并在自己的回合中行动。在战斗之外，他们可能会跑一些小差事或侦察一个地区，但他们不会心甘情愿地离开他们发誓要保护的人超过几英里的距离。",
	"If your cohort dies and is not revived, you must return to a populated area (such as a city or village) and spend {@dice 2d6} days searching for another suitable cohort.": "如果你的队友死亡并且没有复活，你必须回到一个有人居住的地方（如城市或村庄），花{@dice 2d6}天时间寻找另一个合适的队友。",
	"By the time you reach 6th level, your spiritual connection to the land has granted you and your cohort protection against those who would use its power against you. You both gain resistance to poison damage, and are immune to the poisoned condition.": "当你达到6级时，你与土地的精神联系已经赋予你和你的同伴保护，使他们不会被那些利用土地的力量来对付你。你们都获得了对毒物伤害的抵抗力，并对中毒状态免疫。",
	"With your title comes authority, and at 10th level you learn a new way to wield it. As an action, you can issue a simple command (such as those detailed in the command spell) to a number of creatures equal to double your Charisma modifier. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or be magically compelled to carry out the command for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.": "你的头衔带来了权威，在10级时你学会了一种新的方式来行使它。作为一个行动，你可以向一定数量的生物发出一个简单的命令（如命令咒语中所描述的那些），其数量相当于你的魅力修饰值的两倍。每个目标都必须对你的法术救赎DC进行智慧救赎，或者被魔法强制执行该命令，持续的回合数与你的魅力修饰值相同。",
	"At the end of each of their turns for the duration, targeted creatures can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on themselves on a success.": "在持续时间内的每个回合结束时，目标生物可以重复智慧救赎的动作，如果成功则结束对自己的影响。",
	"On each of your turns for the duration, you can issue a new command that must be able to be performed in one round. For the following round, targeted creatures will instead perform the new command on their turn.": "在持续时间内的每个回合，你可以发出一个新的指令，该指令必须能在一个回合内执行。在接下来的回合中，目标生物反而会在他们的回合中执行新指令。",
	"Once you've used this feature, you must finish a long rest before doing so again.": "一旦你使用了这个功能，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次这样做。",
	"By 14th level, you exude an aura of power and importance that inspires fear and awe in those around you. As long as you aren't incapacitated, hostile creatures who enter or begin their turn in a space within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the beginning of your next turn.": "到14级时，你会散发出一种力量和重要性的光环，使你周围的人产生恐惧和敬畏。只要你没有丧失能力，进入你10英尺范围内的空间或开始他们的回合的敌对生物必须进行智慧救赎，否则就会对你感到恐惧，直到你下一个回合开始。",
	"You were reincarnated. Either you were chosen by nature, by fate, or by the casting of magics, but you've returned to the world in a new body. What new experiences will you try? What old memories linger on? There is a bright world out there for you to rediscover.": "你是转世的。要么你是被自然选择的，要么是被命运选择的，要么是被施展魔法选择的，但你已经以一个新的身体回到了这个世界。你将尝试哪些新的体验？哪些旧的记忆还在徘徊？外面有一个光明的世界等着你去重新发现。",

If given good reason to strive for a goal, few creatures can match the relentlessness of a hagspawn.": "鹰身人有充分的理由感到愤恨和愤怒。他们被女巫的父母认为是不值得的，被他们的人类亲属以恐惧的眼光看待，在经历了被遗弃和虐待的生活之后，他们很快就会发怒，对信任的态度很迟钝，而且彻底悲观，这并不奇怪。在一个将他们视为怪物的世界里，巫师寻求自己的道路。由于在人类社会中很少有机会让巫师成功，他们必须自己开辟道路。这使得大多数巫师勤奋、无情，并有强烈的独立性。如果有充分的理由为一个目标而奋斗，很少有生物能比得上岩浆人的不懈努力。",
	"Over the years, some hagspawn have proven themselves capable of overcoming the irredeemably evil nature of their mothers through heroic feats and good deeds. Tales of stoic, unflinching hagspawn heroes, standing their ground when others have fled, are legend in the tales of Rashemen. It is thanks to the deeds of hagspawn past that their descendants experience some small level of acceptance among those few humans broad-minded enough to give them a chance to prove themselves. And given the chance, hagspawn often live up to these high expectations.": "多年来，一些食人魔已经证明自己有能力通过英雄的壮举和善行来克服他们母亲不可救药的邪恶本质。坚忍不拔的哈格孢恩英雄的故事，在其他人逃跑的时候站在他们的立场上，是拉希门故事中的传奇。正是由于哈格孢恩过去的事迹，他们的后裔在少数心胸宽广的人类中获得了某种程度的认可，足以给他们一个机会来证明自己。如果有机会，巫师往往不辜负这些高期望。",
	"Hagspawn inherit features from their hag parentage that make many humans feel uncomfortable. Often taller than most humans, hagspawn have long, powerful limbs and large hands. Their eyes are like those of their mothers, gleaming red. Humans assume they can only hold malice for all they behold, yet this tells us more about human fearfulness than the truth about hagspawn. Hagspawn skin tone varies as much as humans', however there are distinct tinges to hagspawn that do not occur in most humans; the offspring of an annis hag is a pallid blue whereas that of green hag is unsurprisingly green. Even with these distinctive features, hagspawn sometimes pass for humans in lands where hags are rare—in Rashemen, hagspawn are known immediately upon sight.": "雏鹰从它们的雏鹰父母那里继承了让许多人类感到不舒服的特征。雏鹰通常比大多数人类高，有长而有力的四肢和大手。他们的眼睛就像他们的母亲一样，闪着红色的光芒。人类认为他们只能对他们所看到的一切抱有恶意，然而这告诉我们更多的是人类的恐惧，而不是关于hagspawn的真相。巫师的肤色和人类一样变化多端，然而巫师的肤色有明显的色调，而这些色调在大多数人类身上是不存在的；红巫师的后代是一种苍白的蓝色，而绿巫师的后代则是令人惊讶的绿色。即使有这些明显的特征，在女巫稀少的地方，女巫有时也能冒充人类--在拉舍门，一看到女巫就能知道。",
	"Though acceptance of hagspawn is slowly growing, most humans still cannot bear the sight of them. Long-held prejudices poison the minds of humans, and tales of crimes, depravity, and inherently violent natures are still common in closed-minded human populations.": "尽管对巫师的接受程度正在慢慢提高，但大多数人类仍然无法忍受看到他们。长期以来的偏见毒害了人类的思想，关于犯罪、堕落和固有的暴力天性的故事在思想封闭的人类群体中仍然很常见。",
	"However, there are those who see past the hagspawn's appearance and look to their deeds instead. Unsurprisingly, half-orcs and tieflings relate to the trails caused by the fear of others. Increasingly, other non-human races such as dwarves, half-elves, elves, and halflings consider hagspawn innocent of the crimes of their birth and are likely to let hagspawn prove themselves through their deeds.": "然而，也有一些人看透了巫师的外表，转而看重他们的行为。不足为奇的是，半兽人和铁皮人与其他人的恐惧所造成的踪迹有关。越来越多的其他非人类种族，如矮人、半精灵、精灵和半身人，认为食人魔是无辜的，他们可能会让食人魔通过他们的行为证明自己。",
	"The reluctance of humans to accept hagspawn is complex, and based on their hatred and mistrust of hags themselves. The hagspawn is a reminder of the evil hags are capable of, and of their great power. Shame and hate of hags follows hagspawn into human society, though there is growing hope that as the other races accept hagspawn, humans may too be able to shake off their distrust and see these beings as individuals rather than emblems of defeat.": "人类不愿意接受hagspawn的原因很复杂，是基于他们对hag本身的憎恨和不信任。hagspawn提醒人们，hag们有能力作恶，也提醒人们他们的巨大力量。对女巫的羞耻和憎恨随着女巫进入人类社会，尽管人们越来越希望，随着其他种族接受女巫，人类也可能摆脱他们的不信任，将这些生命视为个体而不是失败的象征。",
	"Hagspawn have among the most diverse names in all of Rashemen. All hagspawn begin their lives as orphans, simply abandoned in the wild by their mothers. Should an elf stumble upon a hagspawn, they may give the hagspawn an Elvish name. Though hagspawn accept their given names, it is increasingly common for them to choose their own name as well. Some hagspawn honor their adoptive parents by going by their own name, but using their adoptive parents' tongue. In the past, hagspawn took on human names, some even choosing the surname": "雏鹰的名字在整个拉舍门中是最多样化的。所有的鹰身人都是以孤儿的身份开始他们的生活，只是被他们的母亲遗弃在野外。如果一个精灵偶然发现了一个哈格孢恩，他们可以给哈格孢恩起一个精灵的名字。尽管食人魔接受他们的名字，但他们选择自己的名字也越来越普遍。有些哈格斯人为了纪念他们的养父母，会使用自己的名字，但使用养父母的语言。在过去，巫师们使用人类的名字，有些甚至选择姓",
	"\"Hagblood\" showing acceptance of their heritage and disdain for the hatred of others. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for hagspawn to choose their own names. Further, hagspawn take last names based on where they were born, for example a hagspawn may call himself, \"Rager of Iceborn River.\" Hagspawn names are often gender neutral and chosen by the individual.": "\"Hagblood \"显示出对其遗产的接受和对其他人的仇恨的不屑。近年来，巫师选择自己的名字已经变得越来越普遍。此外，鹰身人根据他们的出生地取姓，例如，鹰身人可以称自己为 \"冰生河的拉格\"。巫师的名字通常不分性别，由个人选择。",

	"Spirit folk are long-lived people, reaching a maximum of 400 years old. They are considered adult upon reaching 55 years old.": "灵民是长寿之人，最长可达到400岁。他们在达到55岁时被认为是成年人。",
	"Descended from the guardian spirits of Rashemen that forever traverse the land, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "从永远横跨这片土地的Rashemen的守护神的后代，你在黑暗和昏暗的条件下有卓越的视觉。你能在60英尺范围内看到昏暗的光线，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中也能看到昏暗的光线。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Due to their sense of balance and benevolence when it comes to nature and the sentient creatures that live within it, most spirit folk tend toward neutral good alignment.": "由于他们对自然界和生活在其中的有生命的生物的平衡感和仁慈之心，大多数灵族都倾向于中性善的排列。",

Spirit folk have two main familial lines: mountain spirits and river spirits.": "灵民是拉西门的守护神和居住在这片崎岖土地上的人类的后代。他们是一种罕见的民族，最常出现在拉希门本身，但也原产于塞斯克和卡拉图尔东部的土地。灵族有两个主要的家系：山灵和河灵。",
	"Spirit folk feel at home in the lands of their ancestors and experience a deep sense of peace with the natural world. Their ancestry provides them with a connection to the spirit world, yet because of their complementary relationship with nature, they do not seek to interfere with the natural balance through the use of magic. Most humans look at spirit folk with envy for their inherent, nearly unshakable love for life.": "灵族人在他们祖先的土地上有家的感觉，并体验到与自然界的深刻和平感。他们的祖先为他们提供了与精神世界的联系，但由于他们与自然的互补关系，他们不寻求通过使用魔法来干扰自然平衡。大多数人类羡慕地看着灵族人，因为他们对生命有着固有的、几乎不可动摇的热爱。",
	"Though appearing much like humans, spirit folk possess highly-refined and attractive features. Appearing in all the diversity that humans display, spirit folk embody the natural beauty of their human and spirit ancestries.

They are famously considered strikingly beautiful.": "虽然看起来很像人类，但灵族拥有高度精炼和迷人的特征。在人类表现出的所有多样性中，灵族体现了他们人类和灵族祖先的自然美。肤色从微妙的苍白到金黄色的桃花心木不等，灵族人有豪华的头发，稀疏的眉毛，但完全没有其他体毛。他们被认为是引人注目的美丽。",
	"Spirit folk feel at home in human society though they most often only remain for one human generation, this to keep themselves from standing out as long-lived beings within a tight knit community. They try to integrate wholly into the society they have chosen and accept the local human rules. Though most humans who interact with spirit folk do not wholly understand their ancestry, they regard spirit folk with reverence, referring to them as \"wise ones\" who possess a deeper understanding of the natural world than most other beings can only hope to achieve. Spirit folk thrive in human society, but also enjoy the company of elves and fey creatures of all sorts, in addition to the spirit guardians that live within Rashemen.": "灵民在人类社会中感到宾至如归，尽管他们通常只停留在人类的一代，这是为了使自己不至于在一个紧密的社区中作为长寿的生命脱颖而出。他们试图完全融入他们所选择的社会，并接受当地的人类规则。尽管大多数与灵民交往的人类并不完全了解他们的祖先，但他们对灵民充满敬意，称他们为 \"智者\"，他们对自然界的理解比大多数其他生命只能望其项背的更深。灵民在人类社会中茁壮成长，但也喜欢与精灵和各种精灵生物为伍，此外还有生活在拉舍门的精神守护者。",

	"This lifestyle is not enough for some taer, who seek the comforts and bounty of warmer regions. These rebellious groups are often the subject of cautionary tales throughout Rashemen.
