{
	"Hello Everybody! This compendium, \"A Series of Stars,\" is the culmination of over 2 years of homebrewing and playtesting a set of stellar and cosmic creations. Over the course of your jaunt through the following 60+ pages, you'll explore an entire starscape of playtested, balanced, and diverse goodies for D&D 5e. These include 7 options for {@filter races|races|source=ASoS} along with a new base race, a {@filter subclass|classes|source=ASoS} for Barbarians, Clerics, Rogues, and Sorcerers, 24 {@filter magic items|items|source=ASoS}, 26 {@filter monsters|bestiary|source=ASoS}, and the {@class Astromancer|ASoS} class.": "大家好! 这本简编，\"一系列的星星\"，是两年多来自制和测试一套恒星和宇宙作品的成果。在你浏览以下60多页的过程中，你将探索整个D&D 5e的经过测试的、平衡的、多样化的好东西的星空。其中包括7个{@filter races|races|source=ASoS}的选项以及一个新的基础种族，野蛮人、教士、罗格和巫师的{@filter subclass|classes|source=ASoS}，24个{@filter magic items|items|source=ASoS}，26个{@filter monsters|bestiary|source=ASoS}，以及{@class Astromancer|ASoS}类。",
	"While all pieces of this compendium are valued and fun, the aforementioned Astromancer is a particular labor of love, comprising of an arcane full-caster class chassis, 6 subclasses, 15 unique spells, a This is Your Life, and 7 of those 24 magic items as class-specific items. We've had dozens of unique playtesters and hundreds of experiences from people playing this class for campaigns and one shots and we couldn't be more excited about all of the responses we've gotten and where the class has ended up.": "虽然这个纲要的所有部分都很有价值，也很有趣，但前面提到的天体法师是一个特别的爱的结晶，包括一个奥秘的全施法者类底盘，6个子类，15个独特的法术，一个这是你的生活，以及24个魔法物品中的7个作为类专用物品。我们已经有了几十个独特的游戏测试者，以及数百个在战役和单人游戏中使用这个等级的人的经验，我们对我们得到的所有反应以及这个等级的最终结果感到非常兴奋。",
	"Everything in the next few dozen pages helps to round out D&D 5e's somewhat sobering lack of cosmic themed content thus far. While Tasha's has helped to address the issue, we hope that this compendium will assist in rounding out this domain in a way you'll use and appreciate, too!": "在接下来的几十页中，所有的内容都有助于完善D&D 5e迄今为止在宇宙主题内容方面有些令人清醒的不足。虽然Tasha的作品已经帮助解决了这个问题，但我们希望这个汇编能够帮助完善这个领域的内容，让你也能使用和欣赏到它",
	"Happy Starfaring! - DianaDM": "星际旅行快乐! - 戴安娜博士",
	"Many creatures have found themselves among the stars or have been otherwise influenced by the grandeur of the cosmos. The following options are just a few examples of beings who have been altered from their original races to a new one that is more astromagically-inclined, as well as a depiction of the Starborn, a wholly new race option.": "许多生物在星空中找到了自己，或者受到了宇宙宏大的影响。下面的选项只是一些例子，它们从原来的种族被改变成了一个更倾向于天体的新种族，以及对星际人的描述，一个全新的种族选项。",
	"For these beings, keep in mind that their original ability scores are suggestions that are meant to align with the race's aesthetic concepts, as well as to occasionally fill a missing combination of original ability scores for certain lineages. However, the following racial options work just as well and have demonstrated balanced play when replacing scores with the optional {@variantrule Customizing your Origin|TCE|Customizing Character Options: Ability Score Increases} rule from {@i Tasha's Cauldron of Everything}, with the DM's permission.": "对于这些生物，请记住，他们的原始能力分数是建议，目的是为了与种族的审美概念相一致，以及偶尔填补某些血统的原始能力分数的缺失组合。然而，在DM的允许下，用{@i Tasha's Cauldron of Everything}的可选{@variantrule Customizing your Origin|TCE|Customizing Character Options: Ability Score Increases}规则替换分数时，以下种族选项的效果同样很好，并且已经证明了平衡的发挥。",
	"Barbarian: {@class Barbarian|PHB|Path of the Moon-Touched|Moon-Touched|ASoS}": "野蛮人: {@class Barbarian|PHB|Path of the Moon-Touched|Moon-Touched|ASoS}",
	"Cleric: {@class Cleric|PHB|Void Domain|Void|ASoS}": "牧师: {@class Cleric|PHB|Void Domain|Void|ASoS}",
	"Rogue: {@class Rogue|PHB|Dustwalker|Dustwalker|ASoS}": "流氓: {@class Rogue|PHB|Dustwalker|Dustwalker|ASoS}",
	"Sorcerer: {@class Sorcerer|PHB|Gravity Soul|Gravity Soul|ASoS}": "巫师: {@class Sorcerer|PHB|Gravity Soul|Gravity Soul|ASoS}",
	"The Astromancer class can be found in the {@5etools Classes|classes.html} page.": "在{@5etools Classes|classes.html}页面中可以找到天体法师的等级。",
	"The spells for Astromancers can be viewed here or in the {@filter Spells|spells|source=ASoS} page.": "天体术士的法术可以在这里或在{@filter Spells|spells|source=ASoS}页面查看。",
	"Items that can specifically be used by Astromancers can be found here or in the {@filter Items|items|source=ASoS|attunement=Class: Astromancer} page.": "可以专门由天体术士使用的物品可以在这里或在{@filter Items|items|source=ASoS|attunement=Class: Astromancer}页面中找到。",
	"The magic items within this homebrew can be found here in a list or in the {@filter Items|items|source=ASoS} page.": "这个自制的魔法物品可以在这里的列表中找到，或者在{@filter Items|items|source=ASoS}页面中找到。",
	"The creatures that exist which have either been affected in some way by cosmic powers or have originated from beyond a physical world are numerous. Such as with races, the following creations are simply examples of creatures that an adventuring party may come in to contact with, whether to fight or parlay.": "在某种程度上受到宇宙力量影响或来自物理世界之外的生物是非常多的。如同种族一样，以下的生物只是冒险者可能接触到的生物的例子，无论是战斗还是交换。",
	"The monsters in this section can be found here or in the {@filter Bestiary|bestiary|source=ASoS} page.": "本节中的怪物可以在这里或{@filter Bestiary|bestiary|source=ASoS}页中找到。",
	"Infinite possibilities abound for how the cosmos of a world is designed. Integrating how each or all of the creations presented in this compendium exist in such a world is, of course, the prerogative of the creative DM. The following will include notes on certain concepts, such as what the void may be understood to be, as well as how the presence of existing cosmological ideas may be conciliated to allow a universe in which the concept of (mostly) empty and traversable space that some of this compendium relies on can exist. As always, these notes are simply examples and may be reinterpreted (or disregarded!) by DMs to suit their particular worlds.": "对于一个世界的宇宙是如何设计的，存在着无限的可能性。当然，整合本汇编中所介绍的每个或所有的创造物如何存在于这样一个世界中，是创造者DM的特权。下面将包括对某些概念的说明，比如空虚可以被理解为什么，以及如何调和现有的宇宙学思想以允许一个宇宙存在，其中本纲要的一些内容所依赖的（大部分）空虚和可穿越的空间概念可以存在。像往常一样，这些说明只是例子，DM可以重新解释（或无视！）以适应他们的特定世界。",
	"Although this compendium was designed with the intent for creations to be largely setting non-specific, some of the material may not mesh with a DM's understanding of their cosmos. One may decide to reorient the concepts presented in the prior pages to allow for these creations, regardless.": "虽然这个汇编的设计意图是让创作在很大程度上不针对特定的环境，但其中的一些材料可能与管理员对其宇宙的理解不一致。人们可以决定重新调整前面几页中提出的概念，以允许这些创造，无论如何。",
	"For example, Realmspace and other canonical Dungeons and Dragons worlds tend to use a system that incorporates crystal spheres, wildspace, and the phlogiston. A DM who wishes to use some aspects of these concepts may conclude that they will keep wildspace, but eliminate the crystal spheres and phlogiston from their canon; making travel to or from any celestial bodies possible through just space.": "例如，真实空间和其他正统的龙与地下城世界倾向于使用一个包含水晶球、野外空间和活塞的系统。一个希望使用这些概念的某些方面的管理员可以得出结论，他们将保留荒野空间，但从他们的典籍中取消水晶球和活塞；使通过空间往返任何天体成为可能。",
	"Perhaps in your world there exists no moon, but a player is interested in playing a Discipline of Moons Astromancer. You can work together to create an unconventional way in which a lunar influence still exists in your world. Maybe you utilize the gossamer starscape of the Astral Plane as a version of traversable space in your homebrew. You could consider having star-based creations originate from here, instead of traditional space. Alternatively, an issue may arise where there already exists a void in your canon that does not emulate the creations in this compendium. You may want to simply rename the creations presented. Don't feel bound by the flavor and suggestions presented in the pages above!": "也许在你的世界里没有月亮，但有一个玩家对扮演月之学科的天体法师感兴趣。你们可以合作创造一种非常规的方式，使月球的影响仍然存在于你们的世界中。也许你可以利用星界的薄薄的星空作为你自制的可穿越空间的一个版本。你可以考虑让基于星星的创造物从这里出发，而不是传统的空间。另外，可能会出现这样的问题：在你的典籍中已经存在一个不模仿本汇编中的创造物的虚空。你可能想简单地重新命名所介绍的创造物。不要觉得被上面几页中的味道和建议所束缚!",
	"The \"void\" is a concept often presented in this compendium, considered to be an abstract of space; its domain both the area between matter, as well as all that exists beyond the known multiverse. In some interpretations, it is \"emptiness\" or a more abstract \"lack of being.\" In other understandings of this universal (or extra-universal, as it may be) force, it is one of terror; a force that seeks to return all things to the dark nothingness that existed before matter had been conceived.": "虚空 \"是本汇编中经常提出的一个概念，被认为是空间的抽象；其领域既包括物质之间的区域，也包括已知多元宇宙之外的所有存在。在一些解释中，它是 \"空 \"或更抽象的 \"缺乏存在\"。在对这种普遍（或额外的普遍，因为它可能是）力量的其他理解中，它是一种恐怖的力量；这种力量试图让所有的东西回到物质被构想出来之前就存在的黑暗虚无。",
	"Some of the beings native to the void, as well as the void's general aesthetic, may bear resemblance to the Far Realm. However, one should consider the varying motivations that the two domains and the creatures native to them possess. Whereas the Far Realm is similarly impossible to understand in its utter madness as the void is, the entities which possess power in the Far Realm do not seek to utterly undo creation as the void does, but rather invade and rule it in their own alien image. These divergent goals implicate a difference in action that the two might take, but a DM may decide that the two have a closer relationship than this section implies.": "虚空中的一些原生生物，以及虚空的总体美学，可能与远界有相似之处。然而，我们应该考虑这两个领域和原生生物所具有的不同动机。虽然远界和虚空一样，在其彻底的疯狂中让人无法理解，但在远界拥有权力的实体并不像虚空那样寻求彻底破坏创造，而是以自己的异类形象入侵并统治它。这些不同的目标意味着二者可能采取的行动不同，但DM可以决定二者的关系比本节所暗示的更密切。",
	"To everybody involved in both playtesting and reading through these creations over the last couple years! Everybody's input has been enormously helpful, with particular shoutouts to @TheAttackBox, @Drakitydrackity, @ChristopherTruth, @Phylea, @CalypsianCourtesan, {@link r/unearthedarcana|https://reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana}, and the {@i Discord of Many Things} for their incredible feedback that served as launching points for reworks that all of these creations underwent.": "感谢在过去几年中参与测试和阅读这些作品的所有人！每个人的意见都对我们有很大的帮助。每个人的意见都有很大的帮助，特别是@TheAttackBox、@Drakitydrackity、@ChristopherTruth、@Phylea、@CalypsianCourtesan、{@link r/unearthedarcana|https://reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana}和{@i Discord of Many Things}，他们的反馈是所有这些作品重新创作的起点。",
	"Save for any potential grammatical errors that have gone unseen, these are the final versions for everything (unless we add in 1 or 2 more things)! However, playtesting is always welcome, so feel free to drop a comment to {@link u/liusediana|https://reddit.com/u/liusediana} with any experiences you might have.": "除了任何潜在的语法错误外，这些都是所有东西的最终版本（除非我们再增加1或2个东西）！但是，我们始终欢迎对游戏进行测试，因此，如果你有任何经验，请给我留言。然而，我们始终欢迎游戏测试，所以请随时给{@link u/liusediana|https://reddit.com/u/liusediana}留言，说明你可能有的任何经验。",

	"Sitting in her creaking hut, eyes slowly becoming weak from pondering over a variety of star charts and augury bones sits an older half-orc woman, believing she is close to determining her tribe's destiny through interpreting the skies. She carefully rolls up an ancient looking scroll and sighs, gazing to the wall and seeing a dozen more maps and a set of dragonknuckles that must be examined by the morning for a full reading.": "一位年长的半兽人妇女坐在她那吱吱作响的小屋里，眼睛因为思考各种星图和占卜骨而慢慢变得无力，她相信自己已经接近通过解释天空来决定她的部落的命运。她小心翼翼地卷起一个看起来很古老的卷轴，叹了口气，凝视着墙壁，又看到了一打地图和一套龙骨，必须在早上之前检查出完整的读数。",
	"Two halfling men stand quietly chanting on opposite sides of a basin, the full moon brightly reflected upon the ritual waters within. The light grows as their incantation quickens, spilling beyond the pool and flooding the area with lunar luminosity. The men turn to the sky as they begin to slowly lift from the land, gravity freeing them from its grasp.": "两个半身人静静地站在一个盆子的两边念咒，满月在里面的祭祀水面上反射出明亮的光芒。光线随着他们的咒语而增长，溢出池外，使该地区充斥着月光的光芒。这些人转向天空，他们开始慢慢地从土地上升起，重力使他们摆脱了土地的控制。",
	"A long-haired elf, finally free to cut through their enemies on the front line, begins to sing in pleasure while fiery winds whip around their body. Brightness seems drawn to them, granting additional light to their inspiring presence and marking brilliant solar sigils along the length of their blade.": "一个长发的精灵，终于可以在前线自由地切割他们的敌人，开始高兴地唱歌，而火热的风在他们的身体周围呼啸。光明似乎被他们所吸引，为他们鼓舞人心的存在提供了额外的光亮，并沿着他们的刀身标记出辉煌的太阳符号。",
	"Enraptured by the grand cosmic forces that dictate even fate itself, astromancers wield the might of celestial bodies to break their foes and unlock secrets within the great dark beyond. Drawing on the enormous energy given off by stars and other universal entities, astromancers gain access to powerful arcane magic. These wise sages are capable of weaving moonlight and starlight in order to hinder their foes, support companions, and manipulate the battlefield.": "天体术士被那些甚至决定命运本身的宏大宇宙力量所吸引，他们挥舞着天体的力量来击溃他们的敌人，并解开巨大的黑暗世界中的秘密。利用恒星和其他宇宙实体发出的巨大能量，天体术士获得了强大的奥术魔法。这些睿智的贤者能够编织月光和星光，以阻碍他们的敌人，支持同伴，并操纵战场。",
	"Astromancy is an elegant and expansive, yet difficult art. The power that comes with revealing the workings of the universe and bridging the distance between arcane and divine serves as a lure; one that is particularly attractive to the most flexible adepts seeking inspiration or raw might.": "占星术是一门优雅而广阔的艺术，但也很难。揭示宇宙的运作和弥合奥术与神性之间的距离所带来的力量是一种诱惑；这对寻求灵感或原始力量的最灵活的信徒来说特别有吸引力。",
	"Adaptability and perceptiveness are the signs of a truly masterful astromancer. Each discipline, whether focusing on the moon, stars, sun, or otherwise favors those who are capable of evaluating a situation and using their abilities to the utmost for decisive action.": "适应性和敏锐性是真正高超的占星师的标志。每一门学科，无论是专注于月亮、星星、太阳，还是其他方面，都有利于那些有能力评估情况并最大限度地利用其能力采取果断行动的人。",
	"Those who specialize in astromancy have great skill in intuitively understanding how different cosmological bodies and patterns work in tandem to either create or show changes in destiny. Astromancers, more so than most arcane casters, have a tendency to engage in faith and spirituality. This often results from their questioning about the source of these patterns and how central fortune is to their art.": "那些专攻占星术的人在直觉上理解不同的宇宙体和模式如何协同工作以创造或显示命运的变化方面有很大的技巧。占星师，比大多数奥术施法者更倾向于从事信仰和灵性的工作。这往往是由于他们对这些模式的来源以及命运对他们的艺术有多么核心的质疑。",
	"It is not uncommon to find that astromancers have adopted deities of fate into their worship, recognizing that the designs of destiny to which gods tend and the constantly shifting organization of constellations and planets are one in the same. Some even view certain deities as the greatest practitioners of astromancy and offer prayers for revelation.": "我们不难发现，占星师将命运之神纳入他们的崇拜之中，他们认识到神明所倾向的命运设计与不断变化的星座和行星的组织是一体的。有些人甚至把某些神灵看作是最伟大的星相术实践者，并为启示祈祷。",
	"As you create your astromancer, one of the most important aspects to consider is how you have gained access to your power. Were you visited by celestial visions suggesting that you had a greater path to follow? Do you perhaps have a mentor that taught you their craft or a natural skill in comprehending universal mechanics? A variety of experiences in your past may have allowed you to tap into the energy given off from cosmic bodies and knowing this history will be useful in deciding your potential discipline.": "当你创造你的星象师时，要考虑的一个最重要的方面是你如何获得你的力量。你是否被天体的幻象拜访过，暗示你有一条更伟大的道路要走？你是否有一个导师教给你他们的手艺或理解宇宙力学的自然技能？你过去的各种经历可能使你能够利用宇宙体发出的能量，了解这段历史将有助于决定你的潜在学科。",
	"You must also consider what you intend to do with the power that you hold. Do you have a specific goal in mind or are you simply attempting to explore the world to gather knowledge and wisdom? Do you plan to protect your homeland with the fury of the sun or do you wish to reveal secrets inherent to the world and further unknown places?": "你还必须考虑你打算用你持有的权力做什么。你是否有一个具体的目标，或者你只是试图探索世界以收集知识和智慧？你是打算用太阳的愤怒来保护你的祖国，还是希望揭示世界固有的秘密，进一步了解未知的地方？",
	"You can make an astromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background hermit} or {@background sage} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名天体法师。首先，智慧应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质或灵巧。第二，选择（%0%）或（%1%）的背景。",
	"To help you create your astromancer, you can use the suggestions found on the following tables to help you decide your character's backstory and goals.": "为了帮助你创建你的天体法师，你可以使用以下表格中的建议来帮助你决定你的角色的背景故事和目标。",
	"The majority of astromancers experience some sort of event or come from a long tradition of practitioners that led them to adopt their craft and ability to tap into cosmic energy. These callings may be quite distinct, varying between small and large influences in the life course of these powerful casters.": "大多数天体物理学家都经历过某种事件，或者来自于一个长期的从业传统，导致他们采用他们的手艺和能力来挖掘宇宙能量。这些召唤可能很明显，在这些强大的施法者的生命历程中，有大有小的影响。",
	"You received glorious visions from an astral being.": "你从一个星际生物那里得到了光辉的愿景。",
	"You had planned on becoming a cleric, but found their worship too constraining for your lofty dreams.": "你曾计划成为一名牧师，但发现他们的崇拜对你的崇高梦想来说太有局限性。",
	"You were kidnapped as a child, forced to join a secretive sect that gifted you arcane power.": "你从小就被绑架，被迫加入一个秘密的教派，该教派赋予你奥秘的力量。",
	"Your family are a long line of astromancers that expect great things from you.": "你的家人是一脉相承的占星师，对你的期望很高。",
	"You happened upon a tower belonging to a master who took you in and showed you cosmic patterns.": "你偶然发现了属于一位大师的塔，他收留了你并向你展示了宇宙模式。",
	"You have always had a knack for understanding the grandeur of cosmic mechanics.": "你在理解宇宙力学的宏大方面一直有一套诀窍。",

	"The starborn are a somewhat physically imposing people, commonly standing taller than 6 feet, but less dense than would be expected for creatures of their dimensions. They largely resemble humans with fine features for most of their lives, though often with airy mantles of stardust surrounding them, widely varying in substance and size.": "星际人是一个有点身体强壮的民族，通常身高超过6英尺，但没有他们这种尺寸的生物所期望的那样密集。他们在很大程度上与人类相似，大部分时间都有精致的特征，尽管他们周围经常有星尘的气膜，在物质和大小上差别很大。",
	"These beings have become intrinsically magical over hundreds of years, resulting from their exposure to the Astral Plane and frequent cosmic jaunts. In late maturity, starborn become less capable of keeping the magical energy they embody contained within their forms, their hair turning to a floating pale gossamer and their bodies emitting a heavier shroud of hovering dust and spectral starlight.": "这些生命在数百年的时间里变得具有内在的魔力，这是因为他们暴露在星界和频繁的宇宙旅行中的结果。在成熟后期，星裔变得不那么有能力保持他们所体现的魔法能量，他们的头发变成了漂浮的苍白的细纱，他们的身体散发出更重的盘旋尘埃和幽灵般的星光的笼罩。",
	"Starborn society places a high value on exploration and ensuring that their ancestors' legacy is eternally honored. Elders within starborn communities teach that their ancestors live on in spiritual forms in order to protect future generations, but only as long as their scions continue to view new lands, meet unfamiliar people, and gather fresh perspectives.": "星裔社会高度重视探索和确保他们祖先的遗产得到永恒的尊重。星裔社区的长老们教导说，他们的祖先以精神形式存活，以保护后代，但只要他们的子孙继续查看新的土地，遇到陌生的人，并收集新的观点。",
	"Core to this ancient belief, starborn consider that the greater the distance they explore makes their travels more valuable to their ancestors. Attempting to honor this practice, these people have committed their culture to a nomadic society; one focused on an ever-shifting diaspora across the worlds and planes.": "这个古老信仰的核心是，星裔认为他们探索的距离越大，他们的旅行对他们的祖先就越有价值。为了尊重这种做法，这些人将他们的文化致力于游牧社会；一个专注于在各个世界和平面上不断变化的散居地。",
	"As experienced nomads who have been honing their way of life over many generations, the starborn have come to realize that their penchant for inter-planar travel opens up the possibility of being a valued set of merchants for many worlds and people. Though starborn trade caravans still maintain the value of gathering different experiences from new lands and societies, they tend to find their way back to a world they have visited before if they come upon an item they know will receive bountiful pay.": "作为经验丰富的游牧民族，经过几代人的磨练，星际人已经意识到，他们对星际旅行的嗜好为他们成为许多世界和人民的重要商人提供了可能性。尽管星裔贸易商队仍然保持着从新的土地和社会中收集不同经验的价值，但如果他们遇到了他们知道会得到丰厚报酬的物品，他们往往会找到回到他们曾经访问过的世界。",
	"The starborn are renowned by those they interact with as a highly welcoming community, seemingly open to as many perspectives and ways of thought as exist across the planes. The starborn do not simply desire to get along with others in order to foster their mercantile habits, but also to slowly build common ground between each world; learning how others live life and then disseminating this knowledge throughout their travels. This practice is based on a cultural tenet which claims that, on a basic level, all people and beings are made of the same eternal elements and should seek to understand each other.": "星际人被那些与他们交往的人誉为一个非常受欢迎的群体，似乎对整个星球上存在的各种观点和思想方式都持开放态度。星际人并不只是为了培养自己的商业习惯而渴望与他人相处，而是要在每个世界之间慢慢建立共同点；学习他人的生活方式，然后在他们的旅行中传播这种知识。这种做法是基于一种文化信条，声称在基本层面上，所有的人和生命都是由相同的永恒元素构成的，应该寻求相互理解。",
	"Under this view of universal commonality, many starborn tend to hold the hope that differences between people can be solved through mutual acknowledgement. More than one fable exists across the multiverse about brief visits from a traveling people who resolve disputes between tense or warring lands, but are never to be seen again.": "在这种普遍共性的观点下，许多星际人倾向于抱有希望，认为人与人之间的分歧可以通过相互承认而得到解决。在多元宇宙中存在着不止一个关于旅行者短暂访问的寓言故事，他们解决了紧张或交战的土地之间的争端，但再也没有人见过。",
	"The chimera's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save {@dc 15}, {@hit 7} to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells requiring no components:": "奇美拉的法术能力是魅力（法术保存（%0%），法术攻击命中率（%1%））。它可以先天性地施展以下不需要组件的法术。",
	"The chimera has advantage against all spells and effects that that alter its form, reduce its speed, or cause it to be {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition restrained}.": "奇美拉对所有改变其形态、降低其速度或导致其{@condition paralyzed}或{@condition restrained}的法术和效果都有优势。",
	"The chimera makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its horns, and one with its claws. When its starfury breath is available, it can use the breath in place of its bite or horns.": "奇美拉有三种攻击方式：一种是咬人，一种是用角，还有一种是用爪子。当它的星煞之气可用时，它可以用星煞之气来代替它的咬或角。",

	"Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of the duskova must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain hit points until the start of their next turn. If a creature is prevented from regaining hit points from a spell in this way, the duskova regains hit points equal to the amount of healing prevented.": "在达斯科瓦10英尺范围内开始他们的回合的生物必须做一个{@dc 17}宪法救赎动作，否则在他们下一个回合开始前无法恢复命中率。如果一个生物以这种方式被阻止从一个法术中恢复命中率，达斯科瓦会恢复与被阻止的治疗量相等的命中率。",
	"Whenever the duskova reduces a target to 0 hit points, the target has disadvantage on death saving throws until it dies or regains consciousness.": "每当黄昏之神将一个目标降低到0点生命值时，该目标在死亡救赎中处于劣势，直到其死亡或恢复知觉。",
