	"Travelers, merchants, and storytellers there are many professions a dwarf may pick up when they leave the underground and choose to live life above it all. Road dwarves have abandoned the smithing and stonecutting techniques of their subterran bretheren but make up for it in skills that help their new trades.": "旅行者、商人和讲故事的人，当一个矮人离开地下并选择在地上生活时，他们可以从事许多职业。道路矮人已经放弃了他们的地下兄弟的铁匠和石匠技术，但在帮助他们的新行业的技能方面得到了弥补。",
	"Dwarven Culture is almost always tied to heritage, whose house is in control of what branch of dwarven society. Living in mountains and beneath the earth is almost second nature to dwarves, so where do road dwarves fit into this? Road dwarves are the revels, the rogues, people who wanted to see more of the world and move away from the deadlocked ideals of tradition. Road dwarves literally take to the road, finding their way along the path as travelers. Many take the chance to become merchants seeking fortune, others begin caravan companies, and even more become wanderlust adventurers.": "矮人文化几乎总是与遗产联系在一起，谁的家族控制着矮人社会的哪个分支。生活在山区和地底几乎是矮人的第二天性，那么道路上的矮人在这方面的表现如何？道路上的矮人是狂欢者，是流氓，是想看到更多的世界并摆脱传统的僵硬理想的人。公路矮人从字面上看是走上了道路，作为旅行者沿着道路找到了自己的方向。许多人抓住机会成为寻求财富的商人，其他人则成立商队公司，甚至更多的人成为嗜好流浪的冒险家。",
	"Spotting a dwarf without armor above ground means you have most likely run into a road dwarf, they have long since abandoned smithing as a profession (though some may choose to relearn) and mostly prefer lighter clothing and weaponry to accomodate their vagabond lifestyles. Their time travelling have put a much lighter step in their heels and thus road dwarves whether on cart, mount, or foot seem to move about much more quickly and frequently than the average dwarf. Being more open to new things means it's not uncommon to spot a road dwarf bard recounting their adventures in a tavern or a master marksman and their trusty heavy crossbow.": "在地面上发现一个没有盔甲的矮人意味着你很可能遇到了一个公路矮人，他们早已放弃了铁匠这个职业（尽管有些人可能会选择重新学习），他们大多喜欢更轻便的衣服和武器，以适应他们流浪的生活方式。他们的旅行时间使他们的脚步更加轻盈，因此公路上的矮人无论是坐车、骑马还是步行，似乎都比一般的矮人走得更快更频繁。对新事物更加开放意味着在酒馆里经常可以看到一个道路矮人的吟游诗人在讲述他们的冒险经历，或者一个大师级的射手和他们信任的重弩。",
	"Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.": "丰富的古代宏伟的王国，刻在山根上的大厅，深矿和炽热的锻造中的镐和锤子的回声，对氏族和传统的承诺，以及对妖精和兽人的强烈仇恨--这些共同的线索将所有矮人团结在一起。",
	"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.": "勇敢而坚韧，矮人被称为熟练的战士、矿工以及石头和金属的工人。虽然矮人的身高远低于5英尺，但他们是如此的宽大和紧凑，以至于他们的体重可以和站在近两英尺高的人类一样重。他们的勇气和耐力也很容易与任何大块头的民工相媲美。",
	"Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.": "矮人的皮肤从深棕色到带有红色的苍白色调不等，但最常见的色调是浅棕色或深褐色，就像某些大地的色调。",
	"Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.": "他们的头发留得很长，但样式简单，通常是黑色、灰色或棕色的，尽管较苍白的矮人常常有红色的头发。男性矮人高度重视他们的胡须，并仔细地梳理它们。",
	"Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.": "矮人可以活到400岁以上，所以最年长的活着的矮人往往记得一个非常不同的世界。例如，一些生活在费尔巴尔城堡（Citadel Felbarr）的最年长的矮人可以回忆起三个多世纪前的那一天，兽人征服了这个要塞，并把他们赶到了一个持续了250多年的流放地。这种长寿赋予他们对世界的看法，这是人类和半身人等寿命较短的种族所缺乏的。",
	"Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.": "矮人就像他们所爱的山一样坚实而持久，以坚忍不拔的毅力经受着几个世纪的考验，几乎没有变化。他们尊重自己部族的传统，将自己的祖先追溯到他们在世界青年时期建立的最古老的据点，并且不会轻易放弃这些传统。这些传统的一部分是对矮人之神的虔诚，他们维护矮人勤劳的劳动、战斗的技巧和对锻造的奉献等理想。",
	"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.": "个别矮人坚定而忠诚，言而有信，行动果断，有时甚至到了固执的程度。许多矮人有强烈的正义感，他们对自己遭受的错误迟迟不能忘怀。对一个矮人所做的错事就是对这个矮人的整个部族所做的错事，所以开始时只是一个矮人的复仇行动可能会变成一个全面的部族争斗。",
	"Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.": "矮人王国延伸到山下深处，在那里，矮人开采宝石和贵重金属，锻造神奇的物品。他们热爱贵金属和高级珠宝的美感和艺术性，而在一些矮人身上，这种热爱会发酵成贪婪。无论他们在自己的山里找不到什么财富，他们都会通过贸易获得。他们不喜欢船，所以有进取心的人类和半身人经常沿着水路处理矮人货物的贸易。矮人定居点欢迎值得信赖的其他种族成员，尽管有些地区甚至对他们来说是禁区。",
	"The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.": "矮人社会的主要单位是部族，矮人高度重视社会地位。即使是远离自己王国的矮人，也会珍惜自己的氏族身份和归属，承认相关的矮人，并在誓言和诅咒中援引他们祖先的名字。没有氏族是可能降临到矮人身上的最糟糕的命运。",
	"Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.": "其他国家的矮人通常是工匠，尤其是武器制造者、装甲师和珠宝商。有些人成为雇佣兵或保镖，因其勇气和忠诚度而备受追捧。",
	"Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.": "开始冒险生活的矮人可能是出于对宝藏的渴望--为了它本身，为了一个特定的目的，甚至是出于帮助他人的利他主义愿望。其他矮人则是受神灵的命令或灵感驱使，是一种直接的召唤，或者仅仅是为了给某个矮人神灵带来荣耀的愿望。宗族和祖先也是重要的激励因素。矮人可能会寻求恢复一个部族失去的荣誉，为该部族遭受的古老错误复仇，或者在被流放后在部族中获得新的地位。或者一个矮人可能会寻找一个强大的祖先所挥舞的斧头，这个斧头在几个世纪前的战场上丢失了。",
	"Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. \"The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,\" is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.": "矮人与大多数其他种族相处得相当好。\"一个熟人和一个朋友之间的区别大约是一百年。\"这是矮人的一句话，可能是夸张的，但肯定指出了像人类这样短命的种族成员要赢得矮人的信任是多么困难。",
	"\"It's not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc's head, they're as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They're flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don't have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf's good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.\"": "\"依赖精灵是不明智的。不知道精灵下一步会做什么；当锤子碰到兽人的头时，他们很可能开始唱歌，就像拔出剑一样。他们善于逃跑，而且很轻浮。不过，有两件事要为他们说。他们的铁匠不多，但他们的铁匠做得非常好。当兽人或地精从山中涌出时，精灵是你的好帮手。也许不如矮人好，但毫无疑问，他们和我们一样讨厌兽人。\"",
	"\"Sure, they're pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?\"": "\"当然，他们是愉快的人。但给我看一个半身人的英雄。一个帝国，一支胜利的军队。甚至是由半身人之手制造的千古之宝。什么都没有。你怎么能把他们当回事？\"",
	"\"You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human's on her deathbed. If you're lucky, she's got kin-a daughter or granddaughter, maybe-who's got hands and heart as good as hers. That's when you can make a human friend. And watch them go!. They set their hearts on something, they'll get it whether it's a dragon's hoard or an empire's throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.\"": "\"你花时间去了解一个人，而那时这个人已经躺在了床上。如果你很幸运，她有亲戚--可能是女儿或孙女--有和她一样好的手和心。这时你就可以交上一个人类朋友。然后看着他们走！。他们把心思放在某件事上，不管是龙的囤积物还是帝国的王位，他们都会得到它。你不得不佩服这种奉献精神，即使它经常让他们陷入困境。\"",
	"A dwarf's name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf's name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.": "矮人的名字是由氏族长老按照传统授予的。每一个合适的矮人名字都被世代使用和重复使用。矮人的名字属于部族，而不是个人。",
	"A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.": "滥用宗族名称或给宗族名称带来耻辱的矮人将被剥夺该名称，并被法律禁止使用任何矮人名称来代替它。",
