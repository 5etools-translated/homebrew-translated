Similarly, living nightmares recognize the curseborn, although whether they consider their material cousins friends, foes or food depends on the nightmare itself.": "诅咒者在威胁下可以释放出的力量直接来自于活体噩梦形成的同一平面。这种直接的联系加上诅咒者所遭受的偏见，使他们与一些闯入现实的活生生的恶梦有了相似的精神。虽然诅咒者仍然承认这些反常的生物是一种威胁，但他们更愿意遏制或转移活体噩梦，而不是消灭它们，因为它们有共同的起源和相似的困境。同样地，活的噩梦也认识诅咒者，尽管它们是否认为它们的物质表亲是朋友、敌人或食物，取决于噩梦本身。",

She thought eating it would heal her son... it would probably just give him indigestion. But the place is very cool. There are wildflowers, mushrooms, tiny pond fish, and gnomes watching from the forest. I hope nobody finds me, never ever.": "我今天找到了一个新的藏身之处。它离特拉瓦有点远，就在那棵腐烂的老橡树西边。在卡尔的保姆又想剪掉我的一块头发后，我飞到了那里。她以为吃了它能治好她儿子的病......可能只是让他消化不良。但是那个地方非常酷。有野花、蘑菇、小池塘的鱼，还有在森林里看着的小矮人。我希望没有人发现我，永远不要。",

You are unaffected by nonmagical difficult terrain when hovering this way, but hovering over a liquid counts as difficult terrain for you. You can fall into a body of liquid if you so choose, but this trait grants you no special ability to propel yourself while underwater.": "你不用走路，而是用你的行走速度在你下面的固体或液体表面上盘旋1-2英尺。以这种方式盘旋时，你不会受到非魔法困难地形的影响，但在液体上盘旋对你来说算作困难地形。如果你选择的话，你可以掉进液体中，但这个特性没有赋予你在水下推动自己的特殊能力。",

	"Their form is utterly alien; a myriad of floating, colorful crystals connected by translucent magical tethers. The largest crystal, at the top of their bodies, has six holes in the place of eyes, where hovering spheres gaze outward.": "它们的形态完全是异类；无数漂浮的、五颜六色的水晶，由半透明的魔法绳索连接。最大的水晶，在他们身体的顶部，有六个孔，作为眼睛的位置，盘旋的球体向外注视。",
	"These people are the nomads, a wandering race from a distant plane that recently arrived in Prismatic Falls. Those who first met the travelers through the rift were originally hostile toward the strange crystal beings, yet the plane hopping experience of the nomads shone through, as they quickly picked up the common language and established communication. Once their peaceful and curious nature became clear to the people of Aysta, they began traveling the world, wandering in search of knowledge about this strange new world.": "这些人是游牧民族，一个来自遥远星球的流浪种族，最近来到了棱镜瀑布。那些通过裂缝第一次见到旅行者的人原本对这些奇怪的水晶生物充满敌意，然而游牧民族的跳伞经验让他们大放异彩，他们很快掌握了共同的语言并建立了沟通。一旦他们的和平和好奇的天性被艾斯塔的人们所了解，他们就开始环游世界，徘徊在这个陌生的新世界里寻找知识。",
	"Since the name of this species is a complex series of musical notes, they were given the name \"nomads\" by the people of Prismatic Falls. At the end of each of their calendar cycles (approximately a millennium) the nomads choose a new home plane, hoping to learn and document everything there is to know before moving onto the next plane. The nomads have only recently arrived on this plane, and the study of this continent has just begun.": "由于这个物种的名字是一串复杂的音符，他们被棱镜瀑布的人们命名为 \"游牧民族\"。在他们每个日历周期（大约一千年）结束时，游牧民族会选择一个新的家园平面，希望在进入下一个平面之前，学习和记录所有的知识。游牧民族最近才来到这个平面，对这片大陆的研究也刚刚开始。",
	"Nomads are entirely made of crystals, from their eyes to their feet. They absorb light to sustain themselves, and they speak to each other by vibrating the different crystals that make up their bodies in specific notes. While some scholars have tried to create a musical script for the language, it is simply too complex and auditory to efficiently put to paper. Nomads have developed their vibrations in order to speak in other languages, though they often have difficulty pronouncing certain words and it is far less natural to them than their original languages of musical notes.": "游牧民族完全由水晶构成，从他们的眼睛到他们的脚。他们吸收光来维持自己的生命，他们通过振动组成他们身体的不同晶体，以特定的音符相互交谈。虽然有些学者试图为这种语言创造一个音乐脚本，但它实在是太复杂了，听觉上的东西无法有效地写在纸上。游牧民族已经发展了他们的振动，以便用其他语言说话，尽管他们经常难以说出某些单词，而且对他们来说，这远不如他们原来的音符语言那么自然。",
	"Nomads do not have genders. Instead, every nomad slowly forms extra crystals that they do not need to function. When 4 to 6 nomads with developed enough crystals come together, they can detach these crystals from their own bodies and construct a tiny nomad, who forms their own magical tethers, and will continue to grow on their own. This group will travel together to raise the child until they are old enough to fend for themselves, after which the group may choose to continue traveling together or go their separate ways.": "游牧民族没有性别之分。相反，每个游牧民族都会慢慢形成他们不需要的额外晶体来运作。当4到6个拥有足够发达的晶体的游牧民族聚集在一起时，他们可以将这些晶体从自己的身体中分离出来，构建一个小小的游牧民族，他们形成自己的魔法束缚，并将继续自行成长。这群人将一起旅行抚养这个孩子，直到他们长大到可以自食其力，之后这群人可以选择继续一起旅行或分道扬镳。",
	"Nomads tend towards non-violence due to their culture as observers and students, so becoming traveling traders makes sense for many of them. They often travel in small groups, obsessively taking notes as they communicate with different peoples and exploring new locales. Of course there are exceptions, as performing missions is also an excellent way to explore the darkest corners of the world, and the nomads who choose to do so can make themselves quite useful to various groups of people.": "游牧民族倾向于非暴力，因为他们的文化是观察者和学生，所以成为旅行商对他们中的许多人来说是有意义的。他们经常以小组形式旅行，在与不同的人交流和探索新的地点时痴迷地做笔记。当然也有例外，因为执行任务也是探索世界上最黑暗角落的绝佳方式，而选择这样做的游牧民族可以使自己对各种群体相当有用。",
	"Nomadic is a language composed entirely of music. Their names are no different, however it is difficult for other races to perfectly sing their names and remember the correct notes. Nomads will usually go by a handle, but if they do give their names, they offer the alternative of phonetic notes—do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. Their names are permutations of four or five of these notes.": "游牧民族是一种完全由音乐组成的语言。他们的名字也不例外，然而其他种族很难完美地唱出他们的名字并记住正确的音符。游牧民族通常会用一个把手，但如果他们真的说出自己的名字，他们会提供音符的选择--Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti。他们的名字是这些音符中四个或五个的排列组合。",

	"Each soul lasts about 40 years for a soulfueled, but if a soul died peacefully or was in acceptance of its use as a battery after death, a soul can instead last up to 100 years. A typical soulfueled has gone through one or two souls; a soulfueled has no maximum lifespan. You are immune to magical aging effects.": "每个灵魂对于一个soulfueled来说可以持续40年左右，但如果一个灵魂平静地死去，或者是接受了死后作为电池的用途，一个灵魂反而可以持续100年。一个典型的soulfueled已经经历了一个或两个灵魂；一个soulfueled没有最大寿命。你对魔法的老化效果是免疫的。",

	"Under incredibly rare circumstances, it is possible for the souls of two beings to become so entwined that they share a single soul. This can happen to twins, through a mishap during resurrection, or even by a powerful curse. However the combination occurs, these two creatures are permanently linked, and must trust each other to survive; if one dies, so does the other.": "在极其罕见的情况下，两个生命的灵魂有可能变得如此纠缠在一起，以至于他们共享一个灵魂。这可能发生在双胞胎身上，通过复活时的意外，甚至是一个强大的诅咒。无论这种结合是如何发生的，这两个生物都被永久地联系在一起，并且必须相互信任才能生存；如果一个人死了，另一个人也会死。",

	"Split souls tend to compliment each others' skills rather than share them; for example, mercenaries might train to fill different combat roles, or musicians may practice different instruments. Sometimes a pair will be naturally synergistic depending on how they were bound together, although in the case of twins, they commonly practice different skills purposefully to widen their combined skill set.": "分裂的灵魂倾向于互相补充对方的技能，而不是分享它们；例如，雇佣兵可能会训练填补不同的战斗角色，或者音乐家可能会练习不同的乐器。有时，根据他们的结合方式，一对人会自然而然地产生协同作用，尽管在双胞胎的情况下，他们通常有目的地练习不同的技能，以扩大他们的综合技能组合。",
	"Becoming a split soul is an involuntary process. The most common way for this to occur is in an accident during resurrection that does not kill the sacrificial soul, someone who has just endured excruciating pain to bring someone back from the dead, but instead forces the two to share a soul. The two people sharing a soul will not always like each other; in fact, they will often hate each other, at least at first. However, they are irreversibly bound until death, and must work together if they are to stay alive. Some pairs will grow to understand each other, while others will continue to harbor animosity.": "成为分裂的灵魂是一个非自愿的过程。这种情况最常见的方式是在复活过程中发生的意外，这个意外并没有杀死牺牲的灵魂，这个人刚刚忍受了极度的痛苦使某人起死回生，但却迫使两个人共享一个灵魂。共享一个灵魂的两个人并不总是喜欢对方；事实上，他们往往会憎恨对方，至少一开始是这样。然而，他们是不可逆转的结合，直到死亡，如果他们要保持生命，就必须一起工作。一些人将逐渐理解对方，而另一些人将继续怀有敌意。",
	"In order to choose the split soul race, another player character within the party must also choose to play a split soul. This race attaches on to any base race, such as a human or an elf, but replaces that race's traits entirely to represent the connection between the two characters.

	"Original travelers have described the state of meditation that brought them to this world, and that the blindfold that appeared with them was what they used to reach this plane—and that here, they could see through it into this world. When the unwoken wished to return home, they found that they couldn't wake up, and were instead forced to live out their lives in this strange plane. Very few unwoken have appeared recently, although the descendants of travelers from centuries ago still learn about their old world.": "原始旅行者描述了将他们带到这个世界的冥想状态，而与他们一起出现的眼罩就是他们用来到达这个星球的东西--在这里，他们可以透过眼罩看到这个世界。当未觉醒者希望回家时，他们发现自己无法醒来，而是被迫在这个陌生的星球上度过一生。最近很少有未醒者出现，尽管几个世纪前的旅行者的后代仍在了解他们的旧世界。",
	"The first unwoken to arrive claimed that this world is almost exactly described in the fiction of their own world, and that in their meditative state, they could actually bend the very fabric of the plane around them, as if they were dreaming. This has led to the theory that the unwoken are projections from the Sunken Plane, and that their material bodies are still back home. When the unwoken found that they couldn't leave, it is believed that their material body 'woke up', but the projection remained, leading to the name 'unwoken'.": "第一批到达的未醒者声称，这个世界几乎与他们自己世界的小说描述完全一致，在他们的冥想状态下，他们实际上可以弯曲他们周围的平面结构，就像他们在做梦一样。这导致了一种理论，即未醒者是来自沉没平面的投影，而他们的物质身体仍在家乡。当未醒者发现他们无法离开时，人们认为他们的物质身体 \"醒了\"，但投影仍然存在，这导致了 \"未醒者 \"这一名称。",
	"Unwoken reproduce asexually by 'dreaming' up a child in their sleep, which takes a portion of their soul to do. The child appears as a sphere of purple energy and slowly forms an unwoken over the span of about ten years. The orb can hear its parent even before it starts to take a humanoid shape, and they will learn most of their knowledge of the old world while they are in this child-like state. Each unwoken can only dream of a child this way once in each of their lives.": "未觉醒者通过在睡眠中 \"梦见 \"一个孩子进行无性繁殖，这需要他们的一部分灵魂来完成。孩子以紫色能量球的形式出现，并在大约10年的时间里慢慢形成一个未醒者。球体甚至在开始形成人形之前就能听到其父母的声音，他们在这种类似孩子的状态下会学到大部分关于旧世界的知识。每个未被唤醒的人在他们的一生中只能梦见一次这样的孩子。",

	"The battleborn were originally slaves in the military of the Iron Fist Empire, created by experiments on captured tieflings and conscripted. When the Empire attacked the {@race dwarf||dwarves} that lived beneath their lands, a horrific slog in the tunnels against the experienced subterranean fighters exposed cracks in the battleborn resolve.

	"Battleborn names have evolved over the years since escaping servitude, but the principle has remained the same, at least in areas close to the Empire. Battleborn received Imperial or orcish names from the scientists who created them, a tradition that has continued, however during their conquests a new tradition formed; the warrior name. Each battleborn lives under their given name until they can claim a warrior name through their deeds on the field of battle, which is usually a single word summarizing how they fight. Warrior names are often used as handles in Prismatic Falls.": "自从摆脱奴役后，战国人的名字多年来一直在演变，但原则是不变的，至少在靠近帝国的地区是如此。战斗民族从创造他们的科学家那里得到了帝国或兽人的名字，这个传统一直在延续，然而在他们的征服中形成了一个新的传统；战士的名字。每个战斗民族都以他们的名字生活，直到他们能够通过他们在战场上的事迹获得一个战士的名字，这通常是一个总结他们如何战斗的单字。战士的名字在《棱镜瀑布》中经常被用作手柄。",

	"When the Overgrowth sprang to life seemingly from nowhere, so too did its most common denizens—the beastfolk. The animal-human hybrids come in many varieties—from elephants to mice, toads to eagles, lions to house cats. Beastfolk look like anthropomorphic versions of these animals; their body is structured much like humans and elves, with features from a certain animal, such as a coat of fur, wings, or claws. Some beastfolk are closer to animals that walk like humanoids, while others are almost indistinguishable from a human with some animalistic features.": "当 \"过度生长 \"似乎从哪儿冒出来的时候，它最常见的居民也是如此--兽人。这种动物与人类的混血儿有很多种类--从大象到老鼠，从蟾蜍到老鹰，从狮子到家猫。兽人看起来就像这些动物的拟人化版本；他们的身体结构很像人类和精灵，具有某种动物的特征，如皮毛、翅膀或爪子。有些兽人更接近于像人一样行走的动物，而有些兽人则几乎与人类无异，具有一些动物性特征。",

	"Beastfolk in the Overgrowth form large clans that function as collective families. Members of these groups share a name, and change their name if they change groups.

	"At the core of each soulfueled is a Soul Battery—a device designed to generate magical energy by drawing it from a once-living soul, which they must replace occasionally.

	"The flashes that soulfueled experience are echoes of every single soul used to power them. The very essence of each soul is absorbed by the runic steel of their bodies as they are powered, imprinting memories that remain long after the power is drained from the soul.

Older soulfueled who have replaced their power source multiple times will have considerably more nightmares than a freshlybooted soulfueled, as more memories are trapped within their body.": "灵魂燃料所经历的闪光是每一个用来驱动它们的灵魂的回声。每一个灵魂的本质在他们获得能量时被他们身体的符文钢所吸收，留下了记忆，这些记忆在力量从灵魂中耗尽后仍然存在。灵魂附身者可以从这些噩梦中收集知识或经验，尽管他们所付出的精神代价有时会超过其收益。已经多次更换过动力源的年长的灵魂燃烧者会比刚启动的灵魂燃烧者有更多的噩梦，因为更多的记忆被困在他们的身体里。",
