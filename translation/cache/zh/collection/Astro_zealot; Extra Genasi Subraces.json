	"You have resistance to thunder and lightning damage.": "你对雷霆和闪电伤害有抵抗力。",
	"You know the {@spell Thunderclap} cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell Witch Bolt} spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "你知道（%0%）的咒语。一旦你达到3级，你可以用这个特质作为1级法术施放一次（%1%）的咒语，当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得这样施放的能力。体质是你对这些法术的施法能力。",
	"In the highest reaches of the Plane of Air an endless storm rages, giving birth to energetic and impulsive elementals.": "在空气界的最高处，无尽的风暴在肆虐，诞生了精力充沛和冲动的元素。",
	"As a Storm Genasi, you have inherited the raw and unpredictable nature of thunder and lightning. Storm Genasi are often quick to action and volatile in their choices, and are rarely content to sit quietly or contained.": "作为一个风暴精灵，你继承了雷霆和闪电的原始和不可预知的特性。风暴族人往往行动迅速，选择多变，很少满足于安静地坐着或被人控制。",
	"Some Storm Genasi can be mistaken for ordinary humanoids, however the electricity dancing in their eyes and jumping between strands of their hair may betray their true ancestry. Most Storm Genasi have blue eyes, though yellow and other colors have been documented as well. Their hair can range from platinum to blonde, to orange, with some even having bright blue or green. Their skin, like most Genasi, can range from humanoid flesh tones to more dramatic blues, greens, and yellows. Some Storm Genasi can be seen with electricity arcing just beneath the skin, or walk with noticeably thunderous steps.": "一些风暴精灵可以被误认为是普通的人类，然而他们眼中跳动的电流和在头发丝间跳跃的电流可能出卖了他们的真正祖先。大多数风暴族人的眼睛是蓝色的，尽管黄色和其他颜色也有记载。他们的头发范围从白金色到金黄色，再到橙色，有些甚至有明亮的蓝色或绿色。他们的皮肤，像大多数Genasi一样，可以从人类的肉色到更引人注目的蓝色、绿色和黄色。有些风暴族人可以看到皮肤下有电弧，或者走路时有明显的雷鸣般的脚步声。",
	"Storm Genasi are often quick speakers or exceptionally loud ones.": "风暴族人通常是快速的扬声器，或特别响亮的扬声器。",
	"Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.": "那些想到其他星球的人认为它们是遥远的、偏僻的领域，但星球的影响在全世界都能感觉到。它有时表现在那些由于出生时的意外而在血液中携带星球的力量的人身上。吉纳西就是这样的人，是精灵和凡人的后代。",
	"The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, do not face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.": "元素界对物质界的人来说往往是不友好的：破碎的土地、灼热的火焰、无边的天空和无尽的海洋，使得访问这些地方即使是短时间也很危险。然而，强大的精灵在进入凡人世界时不会面临这样的麻烦。他们能很好地适应物质世界的混合元素，而且他们有时会出于自愿或受魔法蛊惑而访问。有些精灵可以化身为凡人，隐姓埋名地旅行。",
	"During these visits, a mortal might catch a genies eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal-genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that's lain dormant for generations.": "在这些访问中，凡人可能会吸引精灵的目光。友谊的形成，浪漫的绽放，有时还会产生孩子。这些孩子是精灵：与两个世界有联系的人，但不属于任何一个世界。有些精灵是由凡人和精灵结合而生，有些精灵的父母是两个精灵，还有极少数的精灵在他们的家谱上有更高的地位，表现出世代沉睡的元素遗产。",
	"Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.": "偶尔，基因人也会因为暴露在元素力量的激增下而产生，比如内层世界的喷发或星球融合等现象。元素能量饱和了该地区的任何生物，并可能改变他们的本性，以至于他们与其他凡人的后代生来就是基因人。",
	"Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.": "Genasi继承了他们双重性质的一些东西。他们与人类相似，但有不寻常的皮肤颜色（红色、绿色、蓝色或灰色），而且他们身上有一些奇怪的东西。流淌在他们血管中的元素血液在每个基因人身上的表现都不一样，往往是魔法的力量。",
	"Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).": "从轮廓上看，精灵族人通常可以与人类相媲美。土系或水系血统的人往往比较重，而气系或火系的人则比较轻。一个特定的基因人可能有一些让人联想到凡人父母的特征（精灵的尖耳朵，矮人的粗壮身躯和浓密的头发，半身人的小手和小脚，地精的超大眼睛，等等）。",
	"Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.": "Genasi几乎从未与他们的元素父母接触过。精灵很少对他们的凡人后代感兴趣，把他们视为意外。许多人对他们的基因人子女根本没有感觉。",
	"Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.": "一些基因人作为弃儿生活，因为他们令人不安的外表和奇怪的魔法而被流放，或者在未开化的土地上担任野蛮人和怪异邪教的领导。其他人则获得了具有巨大影响力的职位，尤其是在元素生物受到尊敬的地方。少数精灵离开物质世界，在其精灵父母的家庭中寻找庇护。",
	"Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.": "基纳西人很少缺乏自信，他们认为自己几乎可以应对他们道路上的任何挑战。这种自信在一个Genasi身上可能表现为优雅的自我肯定，在另一个Genasi身上则表现为傲慢。这种自信有时会使玄武门人对风险视而不见，他们的伟大计划常常使他们和其他人陷入困境。",
	"Too much failure can chip away at even a genasis sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.": "太多的失败会削弱甚至是一种自我意识，因此他们不断地促使自己改进，磨练自己的才能，完善自己的技艺。",
	"As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.": "作为罕见的生命，genasi可能在一生中都不会遇到另一个他们的同类。没有伟大的Genasi城市或帝国。Genasi很少有自己的社区，通常采用他们出生时的文化和社会。他们的外表越是奇怪，他们的日子就越难过。许多基因人在繁华的城市中迷失了自己，在习惯了各种不同人的地方，他们的与众不同几乎不会引起人们的注意。",
	"Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends. Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.": "不过，那些生活在边疆的人的日子要艰难得多。那里的人们往往不太接受差异。有时，一个冷漠的肩膀和一个怀疑的目光是genasi所能希望得到的最好结果；在更落后的地方，他们面临着排斥，甚至被人们误认为是魔鬼的暴力。面对艰难的生活，这些基因人在荒野中寻求隔离，在山区或森林、湖泊附近或地下安家。",
	"Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerun, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.": "大多数王国的空气和火精灵都是曾经统治卡里姆山的精灵和伊夫里特的后裔。当这些统治者被推翻后，他们在星球上的孩子被分散了。几千年来，这些精灵的血统已经扩散到其他地区。虽然不常见，但空气和火系精灵更可能出现在法轮的西部地区，从卡里姆山向北到剑海岸的沿海地区，以及东部的西部中心地带。有些人还留在他们古老的家乡。",
	"In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "相比之下，水系和土系精灵没有共同的历史。个人很难追踪自己的血统，而且血统偶尔会跳过一两代。许多土族人起源于北方，并从那里传播出去。水系基因人来自沿海地区，其中最集中的是堕落星海周围的地区。",
	"The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerun. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.": "遥远的扎哈拉（Zakhara）对大多数法隆（Faerun）的居民来说只在传说中知道。在那里，精灵和施法者进行交易，而精灵可以从这种契约中产生。在那片土地的历史上，这些精灵一直是巨大利益和灾难的来源。",
	"Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.": "基纳西人使用他们所生长的民族的命名惯例。他们后来可能会取一些独特的名字来捕捉他们的遗产，如火焰、微光、波浪或玛瑙。",
	"Your body is capable of emitting light which glows like that of the magma which courses through the earth deep beneath your feet. You can create bright light for 30 feet, and dim light for another 30 feet.": "你的身体能够发出光芒，就像你脚下深处的岩浆所发出的光芒。你可以在30英尺范围内产生亮光，在另外30英尺范围内产生暗光。",
	"You have resistance to fire damage, however cold damage reduces your speed by 5 feet until the end of your next turn.": "你对火的伤害有抵抗力，然而寒冷的伤害使你的速度降低5英尺，直到你的下一回合结束。",
	"Your ties with the most primal component of the world are not easily contained, but you have mastered your control of it. When you damage a creature with an attack or a touch range spell, you can coat your hand or weapon in magma, causing the attack or spell to deal fire damage to the creature. This extra damage equals your level. You may also use this feature to ignite a flammable item that is not being worn or held or, if the item is made of stone or metal, you may attempt to melt it. You can use this feature twice per long or short rest.": "你与世界上最原始的组成部分的联系不容易控制，但你已经掌握了对它的控制。当你用攻击或接触范围的法术伤害一个生物时，你可以将你的手或武器涂上岩浆，使攻击或法术对该生物造成火焰伤害。这个额外的伤害等同于你的等级。你也可以用这个特性来点燃没有被穿戴或持有的易燃物品，如果该物品是由石头或金属制成的，你可以尝试融化它。你可以在每个长或短的休息时间内使用这个特性两次。",
	"Between the Planes of Earth and Fire lies the Plane of Magma, a land of primal creation.": "在土火两界之间有一个岩浆界，是一个原始的创造之地。",
	"As a Magma Genasi, you have inherited both the timeless endurance and the explosive fury of the volcanoes which shape the world. You are unshakable in both your decisions and your resolve.": "作为一名岩浆族人，你继承了塑造世界的火山永恒的耐力和爆炸性的怒火。你的决定和决心都是不可动摇的。",
	"Magma Genasi can often be confused for their Earth cousins, however the lava which flows through the pores and cracks in their flesh quickly breaks that illusion. Their skin can range from a glassy obsidian black, to a coarse and pitted grey or tan pumice, or even the colors of some more brilliant minerals. Magma Genasi are cool to the touch, but a heat dwells underneath, ready to spring forth. Some magma genasi have normal hair, with as much variety of color as their skin, while others have locks that seem to be carved of stone, and can melt to lava under extreme emotion.": "岩浆族人经常会被混淆成他们的地球表亲，然而流经他们肉体的毛孔和裂缝的岩浆很快就打破了这种错觉。他们的皮肤可以是玻璃般的黑曜石色，也可以是粗糙的、有坑洼的灰色或棕褐色浮石色，甚至可以是一些更亮的矿物的颜色。岩浆族人触摸起来很凉爽，但下面却潜藏着一股热量，随时准备涌出。一些岩浆族人有正常的头发，颜色和他们的皮肤一样多，而另一些人的头发似乎是石头雕刻的，在极端情绪下可以融化成岩浆。",
	"Magma genasi voices may sound coarse for the first few syllables after not speaking for a while, but quickly smooth out to deep but even flow.": "在一段时间不说话后的头几个音节中，岩浆族人的声音可能听起来很粗糙，但很快就会平缓下来，变成深沉而均匀的声音。",
	"You have resistance to cold damage, and cannot be frozen, however you have weakness to fire damage. You're also naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.": "你对寒冷伤害有抵抗力，不能被冻住，但是你对火灾伤害有弱点。你也天生适应寒冷的气候，如《地下城主指南》第五章所述。",
	"You know the {@spell Frostbite} cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell Armor of Agathys} spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "你知道（%0%）的咒语。一旦你达到3级，你可以用这个特质作为1级法术施放一次（%1%）的咒语，当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得这样施放的能力。体质是你对这些法术的施法能力。",
	"With ancestors hailing from the frozen boundary between the Planes of Water and Air, Ice Genasi are a hearty people, hardened against the cold and no stranger to cruel environments, finding ways to prosper in even the most unforgiving landscapes.": "冰原人的祖先来自于水和空气星球之间的冰封边界，他们是一个健全的民族，能够抵御寒冷，对残酷的环境并不陌生，即使在最无情的地貌中也能找到繁荣的方法。",
	"While some take more after their mortal parents, those with stronger ties to their elemental genealogy often have pallid skin that is cold to the touch, and glimmers under the light. Their hair can often be translucent, sometimes even frozen solid atop their heads, needing to thaw before styling.": "虽然有些人更像他们的凡人父母，但那些与他们的元素谱系有更紧密联系的人往往有苍白的皮肤，触摸起来很冷，在光线下闪闪发光。他们的头发往往是半透明的，有时甚至在头顶上冻成了固体，需要解冻后才能进行造型。",
	"Ice Genasi are often uncomfortable in the heat, but can assimilate in average climates, although their own towns in the colder regions of the world are home to beautiful architecture built from the ice itself.": "冰族人在炎热的环境中常常感到不舒服，但可以在一般的气候中同化，尽管他们自己在世界寒冷地区的城镇中拥有由冰本身建造的美丽建筑。",
	"Your elemental ancestors had already burnt brightly and been extinguished for eons before the birth of your people, a timeless existence that you have inherited. The first time you would be required to make a saving throw against {@condition exhaustion} in a day, you can call upon the nature of your people, automatically succeeding on the saving throw. Once you use this trait, you must complete a long rest before you can do so again.": "你的元素祖先在你的族人诞生之前就已经燃烧得很旺盛，并且已经熄灭了好几个世纪，这是一个永恒的存在，你已经继承了。当你在一天内第一次被要求对（%0%）进行救赎时，你可以召唤你的人民的自然，自动成功救赎。一旦你使用了这个特性，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次这样做。",
	"You know the {@spell Poison Spray} cantrip.

	"With ancestry originating from the long since burned out reaches of the plane of fire, Ash Genasi have inherited the calm and patient nature of their extinguished ancestors.": "Ash Genasi的祖先来自于早已燃烧殆尽的火界，他们继承了熄灭的祖先的平静和耐心。",
	"Most Ash Genasi have grayed skin and subdued features, their faces sometimes being nearly featureless, as if pieces of them had simply crumbled away. In many cases their skin can even flake away and float in the wind like the cinders from a fire, though traces of the fire that once blazed within their ancestors can be found in the hair and eyes of some.": "大多数灰烬族人的皮肤发白，五官低调，他们的脸有时几乎没有特征，就像他们的脸被简单地揉碎了。在许多情况下，他们的皮肤甚至会剥落，像火的灰烬一样在风中漂浮，尽管在一些人的头发和眼睛里可以找到他们祖先曾经燃烧过的火焰的痕迹。",
	"They often find their homes in caves and mountains, some even gravitating towards volcanoes, seeking some reminder of the fire which their ancestors were born from.": "他们经常在洞穴和山区找到自己的家，有些甚至倾向于火山，寻找一些提醒他们祖先诞生的火焰。",
	"You can allow your form to fall apart like your ancestors, carried by the breeze along the path of least resistance. As a reaction to taking damage, you can teleport up to 30 feet, releasing enough of yourself to {@condition blinded|phb|blind} your opponents. Every creature within 5 feet of the point you teleport from must succeed on a constitution saving throw or else be blinded until the end of your next turn. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.": "你可以让你的形体像你的祖先一样分崩离析，被微风带着沿着阻力最小的路径走。作为受到伤害的反应，你可以传送到30英尺的地方，释放出足够的自己给你的对手。每一个在你传送点5英尺范围内的生物都必须在体质测试中成功，否则就会失明，直到你下一个回合结束。障碍值等于8+你的熟练度加成+你的体质修正值。一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",

	"The elemental plane of earth is considered to be the most resilient of all. But at the edge of the plane, where the earth faces elemental chaos, even the hardiest of stones are ground to dust. The elementals of this region have given birth to a race who can weather all storms, as their ancestors have been weathered by far worse.": "土元素的平面被认为是最有弹性的。但是在这个平面的边缘，在地球面对元素混乱的地方，即使是最坚硬的石头也会被磨成灰尘。这个地区的元素诞生了一个能够经受住所有风暴的种族，因为他们的祖先已经经受了更严重的风暴。",
	"Their features are smooth, usually considered quite beautiful by those who observe them, though it hides a fierce strength of both body and will underneath. Although many have coloration resembling the more common stones of the world, their skin is incredibly fair, and it is not entirely uncommon to see the odd gem tone in one of their kind, akin to a diamond in the rough.": "他们的特征是光滑的，通常被观察他们的人认为是相当美丽的，尽管在这之下隐藏着身体和意志的凶猛力量。虽然许多人的肤色类似于世界上更常见的宝石，但他们的皮肤却异常白皙，在他们的同类中看到奇怪的宝石色调并不完全罕见，就像一块粗糙的钻石。",
