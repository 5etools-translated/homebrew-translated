	"This adventure is designed for a group of four or five 2nd-3rd level characters, though it is easily modifiable for 4th-5th level PCs by making all the goblin whelps regular goblins and adding +2 to the skill challenge DCs. To enjoy with even higher level PCs, turn all the whelps to goblins, maximize the HP of all the other foes, and increase the DC of all tests by +5 (to a max {@dc 20}).

	"What happens when a tribe of goblins stumbles upon a downed gnomish airship? Nothing good, especially since they can't land it and can hardly control it. The PCs are called upon by a gnomish clan to try not only to stop the goblins, but also to save the ship and the gnomish prisoners the goblins have aboard it. To do so, the PCs will have to fly in a hot air balloon or some gnomish sprocket gliders (rudimentary magic-mechanical biplanes) and dog-fight goblins riding giant wasps to accomplish the task.": "当一个地精部落偶然发现了一艘坠落的地精飞艇时，会发生什么？没有什么好事，尤其是他们无法降落，也很难控制它。一个地精部落要求NPC不仅要试图阻止地精，还要拯救这艘船和地精在船上的囚犯。为此，NPC将不得不乘坐热气球或一些地精的链轮滑翔机（简陋的魔法机械双翼飞机），与骑着巨大黄蜂的地精进行狗斗来完成任务。",
	"The gnomes of Cogclatter are tinkerers, every one. All are famous (in some cases, infamous) for their inventions. Many of said inventions are no more than curiosities, trinkets, or are outright junk. Though a few are revolutionary, none compare to their massive cloud-schooner airship {@item The Soaring Jabberwock|RolledTold1} (a flying vehicle far larger than any other known airship). Still in the gnomish-try-it-prototype stage of development (meaning they are using it, even though it is untested and most likely will end in disastrous results), a band of gnomes took the ungainly airship for a long-range test flight.": "Cogclatter的地精们都是工匠，每一个都是。所有人都因他们的发明而闻名（在某些情况下，臭名昭著）。许多发明都不过是好奇心、小玩意，或者是彻头彻尾的垃圾。虽然有几个是革命性的，但没有一个能比得上他们巨大的云啸飞艇（%0%）（一种远比其他已知飞艇大的飞行器）。仍然处于地精的尝试--原型开发阶段（意味着他们正在使用它，尽管它未经测试，而且很可能以灾难性的结果告终），一队地精带着这艘笨重的飞艇进行了远程试飞。",
	"As with most things in the gnomish-try-it-prototype stage, things went badly. The airship began losing height as one of the four balloons that keep it aloft lost pressure at an alarming rate. Being quick-witted, the skeleton test crew managed to put the airship down safely and went about making repairs. Trying to solve the pressure problem, the gnomes opted for using giant floating fungus creatures. The floating fungus creatures, known as gas spores, are easily popped, so to fix that issue, a rather potent adhesive was mixed up. Coating the fungus spores in the protective adhesive would keep the gas spores from bursting when the gnomes herded them to the airship. The adhesive also aided in \"installing\" the glue-treated gas spores inside the original balloon of the vessel. Discovering that their intimal calculations were a few gas spores shy of the needed lift to fly the airship, the gnomes sent a small band to gather the necessary spores. This is where the Deathsting goblin tribe comes into the story. The goblins went to the gas spore caverns for sport at popping the spores without being killed. They found the gnomes as they were leaving with the needed spores. The goblins stealthily followed the gnomes back to the airship. A handful of the goblins stayed to keep watch as the rest went back to gather the rest of the tribe to attack the strange gnomes and their boat. The sizable goblin mob easily took the ship and captured the gnomes. However, as the tribe began looting the ship, one goblin mistakenly cut the airship loose with most of the tribe onboard.": "和大多数处于地精试制阶段的事情一样，事情进展得很糟糕。飞艇开始失去高度，因为使它保持在高空的四个气球中的一个以惊人的速度失去压力。聪明的骨干测试人员设法将飞艇安全放下，并开始进行修理。为了解决压力问题，地精们选择了使用巨大的浮动真菌生物。漂浮的真菌生物，被称为气体孢子，很容易被弹开，所以为了解决这个问题，混合了一种相当有力的粘合剂。将真菌孢子涂在保护性粘合剂中，可以使气体孢子在地精们将它们赶到飞艇上时不会爆裂。粘合剂还有助于将经过胶水处理的气体孢子 \"安装 \"在船只的原始气球内。发现他们的内部计算离飞艇所需的升力还差几个气体孢子，地精们派了一小队人马去收集必要的孢子。这就是死亡之星地精部落进入故事的地方。地精们去了气体孢子洞，在不被杀死的情况下进行爆裂孢子的运动。他们在地精带着所需的孢子离开时发现了他们。妖精们悄悄地跟着地精们回到了飞艇上。一小部分地精留下来看守，其余的人则回去召集其余的部落来攻击这些奇怪的地精和他们的船。规模庞大的地精暴徒很容易就占领了那艘船，并抓住了地精。然而，当部落开始掠夺这艘船时，一个地精错误地切断了飞艇的电源，船上的大部分部落成员都在其中。",
	"All this misfortune and mischief occurred two weeks ago, and the now-flying goblins have been marauding about the area, attacking, robbing, looting, or just destroying anything that ends up in their flightpath. Being unable to land has done nothing to deter the goblins from utilizing their flying prize. They drop objects-goblins, or, in some cases, livestock-onto targets below them as mobs of goblins slide down ropes or fly down on their giant wasp mounts to overwhelm any travelers, caravans, farmsteads, or small settlements encountered.": "所有这些不幸和恶作剧都发生在两周前，现在会飞的地精一直在这个地区游荡，攻击、抢劫、掠夺，或者只是破坏任何出现在他们飞行路线上的东西。无法着陆并没有阻止妖精们利用他们的飞行成果。他们把物体--妖精，或者在某些情况下，牲畜--扔到他们下面的目标上，妖精们从绳索上滑下来，或者骑着巨大的黄蜂坐骑飞下来，压倒任何旅行者、商队、农庄，或者遇到的小定居点。",
	"During the goblin sky-pirate chaos, the gnomes of Cogclatter have been hard at work on a plan to take back the airship, save the captive gnomes aboard, and spare the countryside from future goblin piracy. The plan they have come up with will require the help of adventurers to pull off and that is where the PCs come in.": "在地精天空海盗的混乱中，Cogclatter的地精们一直在努力制定一个计划，以夺回飞艇，拯救船上被俘的地精，并使乡村免于未来的地精海盗行为。他们想出的计划需要冒险者的帮助才能完成，而这正是NPC发挥作用的地方。",
	"\"The Super Heroic, Wildly Witty Jabberwock Aerial Siege Theory Almost Plan,\" as the gnomes call it, will require the PCs, along with a small group of gnomish engineers, to fly a hot air balloon and a handful of prototype magic-mechanical biplanes called Sprocket Gliders to the airship and take it back from the goblins, thus saving the airship, its crew, and the day. Simple, right?": "\"超级英雄、狂野诙谐的Jabberwock空中围攻理论几乎计划\"，正如地精所称，需要NPC和一小群地精工程师一起，驾驶热气球和少数被称为链轮滑翔机的魔法机械双翼飞机原型飞向飞艇，从地精手中夺回它，从而拯救飞艇、船员和这一天。很简单，对吗？",
	"The easiest way to start such a wild and nonsense-filled adventure is to start in the middle of the action as they are traveling along a road or overland. In this case... Just drop a cow on them! (See {@adventure The Sky is Falling|JollyGobbler|1|The Sky Is Falling}.)": "开始这样一场狂野的、充满胡言乱语的冒险的最简单方法是在他们沿着公路或陆路旅行时，从行动的中间开始。在这种情况下... 就把一头牛丢给他们吧!

	"You have heard rumors that the gnomes of Cogclatter are in the market for adventurers to deal with some sort of goblin problem. Being in need of coin and always seeking adventure, you hit the road en route to the gnomish city. The trek to the lake-bound trade city has thus far proved to be an easy one, since the floating settlement sits at a hub of waterways, well-maintained roadways, and trade routes. Even the weather seems to want to make your trek enjoyable as a warm sun washes down from a clear blue sky. Just as that thought settles in, a heavy shadow washes over you, and strangely, a panicked mooing seems to be coming closer rather quickly.": "你听说有传言说，科格克拉特的地精们正在寻找冒险者来处理某种地精问题。由于需要钱财，而且一直在寻求冒险，你在前往地精城市的路上上路了。到目前为止，前往湖边贸易城市的旅程被证明是很容易的，因为这个浮动定居点位于水路、维护良好的公路和贸易路线的中心。甚至天气似乎也想让你愉快地跋涉，因为温暖的阳光从晴朗的天空中照射下来。就在这一想法尘埃落定的时候，一个沉重的阴影笼罩着你，奇怪的是，一阵惊慌失措的哞叫声似乎很快就会传来。",

	"You stumble clear of piles of refuse and gore, trying to make sense of what had just transpired—somehow, scores of goblins just randomly assaulted you with a deluge of junk, garbage, and livestock. Even harder for your ringing heads to contemplate, the goblins had a flying schooner. Just as that strangeness sinks in, a roaring clamor of rumbling mechanical sounds and a steam whistle fills the air, quickly followed by a sight even stranger than goblins with an airship. Through a cloud of dust, smoke, and steam, four massive covered wagons—devoid of any draft animals—rumble past at breakneck speed, nearly bowling you over. As you leap to safety, the first massive rumbling six-wheeled monstrosity comes to a grinding, sliding halt directly where you had been seconds earlier, as you are enveloped in a massive exhale of hot steam. Atop the still-chugging mechanical wagon, a wild bearded gnome, bedecked in numerous jingling tools and pouches, squints down at you through his dust-smeared goggles, gives you and appraising nod, and then hoots, \"You lot will have ta do. So no time to dawdle. Clamber on aboard, we got thrill'n heroics at pull off and a whole passle of goblins ta put in their places!\" With a wild series of undecipherable hand signals, the gnome appears to want you to climb aboard the wagon.": "你跌跌撞撞地从成堆的垃圾和血肉中走出来，试图弄清刚刚发生的事情--不知何故，几十个妖精就这样随意地用大量的废品、垃圾和牲畜袭击了你。更让你们振奋的是，妖精们有一艘飞行船。正当这种奇怪的感觉沉入心底时，一阵轰隆隆的机械声和蒸汽汽笛的轰鸣声充满了空气，很快就出现了比妖精有飞艇更奇怪的景象。在一片灰尘、烟雾和蒸汽中，四辆巨大的有盖马车--没有任何吃草的动物--以极快的速度冲了过去，差点把你撞倒。当你跳到安全地带时，第一辆巨大的隆隆作响的六轮怪兽直接在你几秒钟前所在的地方滑行停止，因为你被一股巨大的热蒸汽所笼罩。在那辆仍在行驶的机械马车上，一个满脸胡须的野地精，身着无数叮叮当当的工具和袋子，透过他那沾满灰尘的护目镜眯着眼睛看着你，向你点头致意，然后吼道：\"你们这些人必须得做。所以没时间磨蹭了。上船吧，我们有惊心动魄的英雄事迹，还有一大群妖精在等着我们呢！\" 随着一连串难以辨认的手势，地精似乎想让你爬上马车。",

Also, that part of the plan requires them to get these four wagons to a high point further down the road and into the path of the airship.": "在不太可能发生的情况下，NPC没有立即跳上马车，\"捕鼠器 \"试图用恐慌的请求来催促他们。\"你得快点，在我们失去那艘船之前！\"或者：\"没时间闲聊了，我们有地精要停下来！\" 如果这招不管用，他和其他几个地精就会从马车上跳下来，试图把NPC领上船，同时用匆忙而慌乱的语调解释发生了什么，并说他们有一个计划，尽管他们需要NPC的帮助。另外，这个计划的一部分要求他们把这四辆马车弄到路边的一个高点上，并进入飞艇的路径。",
	"Paraphrase the information from the background section and make sure that \"Mousetrap\" highlights the fact that the goblins have the ship's crew and several farm families as prisoners.

	"The effort of hanging on to the wildly bucking and jostling steam wagons as they careen down the rutted roadway and then off of it prevents much conversation with the gnomes. It doesn't take long to realize the wagons are headed towards what looks to be the edge of a sizable canyon and, in the far distance, the hijacked airship. The rumbling wagons come to a screeching halt on the canyon rim and the gnomes rush into the action. They begin ripping tarps off the wagons to reveal what looks to be three huge ballistae. Instead of bolts, the siege weapons are loaded with what can only be described as a trio of clockwork bi-winged flying contraptions. The fourth wagon has a sizable woven basket attached to a gigantic patchwork bladder. \"We got ta hurry and decide who is flying in what before those nasty goblins get within range,\" \"Mousetrap\" hoots as he hurriedly beings cranking one of the ballistae to aim in the general direction of the oncoming airship.": "当蒸汽马车在有车辙的路面上飞驰，然后离开路面时，由于要紧紧抓住这些疯狂摇晃的马车，所以无法与地精们交谈。没过多久，我们就意识到，这些马车正朝着一个相当大的峡谷边缘驶去，在远处，是被劫持的飞艇。轰隆隆的马车在峡谷边缘戛然而止，地精们冲进了行动。他们开始撕掉马车上的防水布，露出看起来是三个巨大的弹炮。攻城武器上装的不是炮弹，而是只能被描述为三个发条的双翼飞行装置。第四辆马车上有一个相当大的编织篮子，连接着一个巨大的拼布囊。\"在那些讨厌的妖精进入射程之前，我们得赶紧决定谁坐什么飞机。\"\"捕鼠器 \"一边叫嚣着，一边匆匆忙忙地摇动其中一个弹弓，瞄准即将到来的飞艇的大致方向。",

So she decided her ogres would just move into whatever settlement they raided, eat all the locals, livestock, and food stores, and then just head to the next settlement they find and do it again. That is the case with the small rural town of Springkernel. This back-country farming community, made up almost entirely of humans and halflings, is the third such town to face the Big Nosh. The ogres are thorough and have not yet left any soul able to give warning of their new pillaging methods. That is why no one in Springkernel ever saw the attack coming.

See the {@creature adult white dragon} stat block for more information on the regional effects.": "这场冒险发生在冬季，而且是在高山上。由于白龙的地区效应，这一点变得加倍糟糕。通常情况下，这种年轻的龙不会成为传奇，但由于在孵化过程中使用了奇怪的黑暗仪式，这对双胞胎被认为是如此。既然如此，区域效应从龙的巢穴延伸的距离从6英里增加到12英里，这意味着它们既影响到通道的最中心部分，也影响到通往塔楼的途径，甚至影响到兽人战营。关于区域效应的更多信息，请参见{@creature adult white dragon}状态块。",

	"A dark cult dedicated to Zannaz the Mirrored God (a version of The {@class warlock||Great Old One warlock patron|great old one}) stole a white dragon egg from a young white dragon. Through dark rites and foul rituals, they tried to birth a two-headed dragon to bend to their will and service. Little did the cult know, the dragon egg had a double yolk. Normally a double yolk only produces a single living dragon, but because of the foul magic, two dragons were born from the egg. The twin white dragons were mentally and spiritually linked, and far more powerful than other white dragons. The cult took this as a sign of blessing from their dark patron. They foolishly lavished the supposed god-blessed dragons with powerful rituals to enhance their already potent abilities, and that was their undoing. The twin dragons' mental abilities and draconic greed were also enhanced, along with their spell casting. Soon, they would not heed the commands of the cult. The dragons gleefully slaughtered their keepers, stole all the magic and wealth the cult had acquired, and went looking to find their own territory to rule. The newly opened and rich gold mine of the Craghearth dwarves was ripe for the taking. The dragons plan to starve out the miners and to bit-by-bit drain the mountain town of its people and resources, until both can easily be taken without much risk to themselves.

	"Focus attacks on a single target whenever possible, until they are slain. Go for rogues, ranged attackers, healers, and spell casters as quick as they make themselves known. If possible, keep flying to thwart melee combatants. Unless a PC declares an action to attack when something comes within melee range, such combat is made nearly useless. Even when declaring such an attack, a PC still gets only a single swing and not all their attacks. Use the dragon's breath weapon as often as you can. As soon as it refreshes, breathe again, as the damage of a breath weapon far exceeds any other damage the dragon can dish out. Do not spare any target from a dragon's wrath. If a target is unconscious or dying, eat them or stomp them. You are not picking on your players; you are roleplaying a dragon. Every dragon fight should be something a PC is never guaranteed to walk away from. Those that do walk away know they earned their lives and possibly a victory over a heinous foe. If the dragon becomes injured, have it use the {@action Dodge} and {@action Disengage} actions to your advantage, and save attacking enemies for Legendary Actions on their turns to make it harder for PCs and their allies to tie the dragon down to one place.

	"Just an hour after dawn, a dwarven messenger bearing the symbol of the Council of Thanes rouses you. \"You have been summoned to the Craghearth Hall of Elders,\" the messenger pronounces in a tone of grim finality. Still wiping the sleep from your eyes, you find yourself inside the expansive interior of the stone and timbered longhouse. You are greeted by six stern-faced and long-bearded dwarven elders. The snowy-haired collection of aged dwarves is the ruling Council of Thanes. You are each given curt acknowledgement from the venerable dwarves and the traditional greeting feast—a simple fare of strong ale, hard bread and heavily salted meats—marking you as a respected and protected guest. aper the draining of three tankards, the eldest of the Thanes, Vori Stonesmile, smooths the ale foam from his snowy mustache and narrows his eyes in a fashion that makes his already face somehow look even more wrinkled. \"We summon ye, one and all, for grim business. The lives of fifty dwarves hangs on the edge of an axe blade. Someone or something has taken control of the mountain pass between here and our newly established mines!\" the old dwarf growls through trembling anger and spits bitterly before continuing. \"The pass is the only way to supply the mine, and three such attempts have already been made to do so. None of those three supply trains have made it to the mine or returned. Now, those fifty souls are in danger of starving or dying from expo- sure, and the fates of those three prior supply trains are a mystery. In my heart, I hope that our missing kin have not met a grim fate. So it seems we are in need of heroes such as ye. We need ye not only to ensure the supplies reach the miners, but also to deal with whatever has taken control of the pass and try to discover the fates of our missing kin. If ye would under- take such, ye will be richly rewarded. What say ye?\" the old dwarf asks grimly underfurrowed and bushy brows.": "就在黎明后的一个小时，一个带着议会标志的矮人信使叫醒了你。\"你被传唤到克拉赫斯长老会大厅，\"信使用一种严峻的最终语气宣布道。你还在擦拭你眼睛上的睡意，你发现自己在石头和木头长屋的广阔内部。迎接你的是六位面容严厉、长髯飘飘的矮人长者。这些白发苍苍的老矮人是执政的泰恩斯委员会。尊敬的矮人对你们每个人都进行了简短的致意，并为你们举行了传统的问候宴会--由浓烈的啤酒、硬面包和重度盐渍的肉类组成的简单食物，标志着你们是受人尊敬和保护的客人。 在喝完三杯酒之后，最年长的酋长沃里-斯通斯米勒抚平了他雪白的胡子上的啤酒泡沫，眯起眼睛，使他本来就不多的脸看起来更加皱巴巴的。\"我们召集你们，所有的人，都是为了严峻的事业。50个矮人的生命悬在斧刃上。有人或东西控制了这里和我们新建立的矿场之间的山口！\"老矮人在颤抖的愤怒中咆哮，并在继续之前痛苦地吐了一口唾沫。\"这个山口是供应矿场的唯一途径，已经有三次这样的尝试了。这三辆补给列车都没有到达矿区或返回。现在，那50个灵魂正处于饥饿或死于爆炸的危险之中，而之前那三辆补给列车的命运是个谜。在我的心里，我希望我们失踪的亲属没有遇到严峻的命运。因此，我们似乎需要像你们这样的英雄。我们需要你们不仅要确保补给品到达矿工手中，还要对付控制山口的任何东西，并试图发现我们失踪亲属的命运。如果你们愿意接受这样的任务，你们将得到丰厚的回报。你们怎么说？\"老矮人皱着浓密的眉毛，面无表情地问道。",

	"No matter how hard it felt for you to finally arrive at the mine, it is nothing compared to the pain and torture the miners look to have endured. The few bearded faces that manage to stir and greet you are hollow-cheeked and haggard. The temporary tents and lean-tos have been used for wrapping hands and feet or burnt for warmth. The mine itself became their only shelter from the winter cold. Food was but a dream a week ago when the last leather belts and boots were used for soup. Of the fifty miners, only five are able to walk or even stand. One of the five makes a great show of trying to straighten his ragged and patchwork clothing before stepping up to you proudly. He gives each of you a grim nod, before saying, \"Good of ye ta come.

The miners had nearly given up hope of aid when the PCs arrive. If asked, Grumby can give the PCs a rough idea of where the {@area Orc War Camp|C|x} is, but knows little else of worth to the PCs.

	"So, at any given moment, until their lair is attacked, one twin dragon will be in the treasure hoard cavern, while the other is on guard—inside/atop the tower or lurking around the rubble outside the tower or flying watch around the area of the storms. If one decides to go hunting, then the other will take up watch until the hunter returns. Once either twin is attacked at the tower or below, the other will head to its sibling to aid in the battle, arriving {@dice 1d4} rounds later. If the battle takes place in or around the Watchtower and is going badly for the dragons, the twins will retreat down into their treasure cavern as quickly as possible. The dragons will hurriedly consume as many of the healing potions as possible. One dragon will use a ready action to fight any foes that come down into the lair. The other dragon will use the exit tunnel and come around and attack the foes from the opposite side, essentially making the foes fight on two fronts.": "因此，在任何时候，在它们的巢穴被攻击之前，一条双龙会在藏宝洞中，而另一条则在塔内/塔顶警戒，或潜伏在塔外的瓦砾中，或在风暴区周围飞行监视。如果一个人决定去打猎，那么另一个人就会负责守卫，直到猎人回来。一旦任何一个双胞胎在塔上或塔下受到攻击，另一个就会前往其兄弟姐妹处协助战斗，并在{@dice 1d4}回合后到达。如果战斗发生在守望塔内或周围，并且对龙来说情况很糟，那么这对双胞胎会尽快撤退到他们的藏宝洞里。巨龙们将匆忙地消耗尽可能多的治疗药水。一条龙将使用准备行动来对抗任何下到巢穴中的敌人。另一条龙将利用出口通道，从对面绕过来攻击敌人，基本上使敌人在两条战线上作战。",
	"A fifteen-foot wide and fifteen-foot tall rough-hewn tunnel runs in a direct path fifty feet from the cavern directly beneath the tower, where the rubble from above has piled to a forty-foot-wide ovoid cavern with a highly domed ceiling. The soaring ceiling is nearly 100 feet high at its peak and riddled with sword-like icicles (see {@creature Gelid-Frost Twin Young White Dragons|RolledTold5|Gelidfrost Lair Actions}). Piled at the dead center of the cavern is the twin dragons' treasure hoard. The trove, the walls, and the entire floor of the cavern is covered in a {@object ice wall|RolledTold5|sheet of ice}. The floor and the hoard area are difficult terrain, due to the ice. Because of the many scrapes, scratches, and furrows made from the dragons' claws, there is little risk of losing one's footing and dropping {@condition prone}, so no {@skill Acrobatics} checks are required as on other icy areas. Along with the treasure there are a dozen humanoid bodies frozen about the floor and against the walls. The frozen corpses are a mixture of dwarves and orcs. These are some of the twins' victims and several of them have been half eaten and refrozen for a later snack.": "一条十五英尺宽、十五英尺高的粗凿隧道从塔楼正下方的洞穴直行五十英尺，上面的碎石堆积成一个四十英尺宽的卵形洞穴，天花板高度圆顶。高耸的天花板在顶峰时有近100英尺高，上面布满了剑状的冰柱（见（%0%））。洞穴的死角处堆放着双龙的宝藏。宝库、墙壁和整个洞穴的地板都被{@object ice wall|RolledTold5|sheet of ice}所覆盖。由于冰层的存在，地板和宝库区域是困难的地形。因为有许多龙爪造成的刮痕、划痕和沟壑，所以几乎没有失足和跌落的风险（%2%），所以不需要像其他冰区那样进行（%3%）检查。与宝藏一起的还有十几具冻在地上和靠墙的人形尸体。这些冰冻的尸体是矮人和兽人的混合物。这些是双胞胎的一些受害者，其中有几个已经被吃了一半，并被重新冷冻起来作为以后的点心。",

	"The twin dragons, though both smarter than your average white dragon, are just as vain and even more confident than others of their breed. They will tactically retreat if necessary, but not run fully from a fight in or around their lair. They will not leave their hoard exposed for the taking and will fight until slain. Since the twins are linked and are now considered legendary, they are twice as dangerous as any single dragon. But since they share a pool of hit points (though they have their own stat blocks and actions), PCs are not trying to defeat two separate dragons.

Now the village and surrounding countryside are under her control and the PCs just happen to wander into the wrong place at the right time to help some children in need.": "一个完全疯狂和哀伤的吸血鬼在一个俯瞰村庄的山岗上的庄园废墟中住了下来。她开始通过将附近的村民变成她的仆人来抚慰她的孤独，既是为了陪伴，也是为了惩罚。现在，村庄和周围的乡村都在她的控制之下，而这些人恰好在正确的时间闯入了错误的地方，帮助一些需要帮助的孩子。",
	"Cruel fate was nothing new to Countess Crina Kilcos. Since she was very young, darkness sought her out and took from her. A vicious creature slaughtered her father when she was so young she almost couldn't remember. But she had just been Crina then. Her title came after, and came with its own share of cruelties. It began when somehow, every morning, she was too weak to rise out of bed. The condition worsened. Soon she thought she would be free of the cruelty of living without a father's love as she lay bedridden and dying of what was deemed a plague. Another kind of plague took her younger brother, Dalibor, next. It snapped his neck like a twig and drank him dry, but only to have a chance at Crina. Had her brother not tried to defend her from the vampire, he would have been spared. But he did not want to give her up to a vampire as the rest of the village had. To the villagers, what was one sick girl, compared to dwelling in fear each night? But when Crina met him, Count Jarek Kilcos was not cruel, but gentle. He did not drink her dry and leave her blue-white corpse as a warning to the village. He did not snap her neck, as he had with her brother. No, the Count embraced her and gave her his gift in such a gentle kiss she barely felt the pain.": "残酷的命运对克里娜-基尔科斯伯爵夫人来说并不陌生。从她很小的时候起，黑暗就在寻找她，并从她身上夺走。一个邪恶的生物屠杀了她的父亲，当时她还那么小，几乎记不得了。但她那时只是克里娜。她的头衔是后来才有的，并伴随着它自己的那份残酷。开始的时候，不知何故，每天早上，她都会虚弱得无法起床。这种情况越来越严重。不久，她以为自己会摆脱没有父爱的残酷生活，因为她卧病在床，被认为是一场瘟疫而死亡。另一种瘟疫接着夺走了她的弟弟达利博尔。它像树枝一样扭断了他的脖子，把他喝干了，但只是为了给克里娜一个机会。如果她的哥哥没有试图从吸血鬼手中保护她，他就会幸免于难。但他不想像村子里的其他人那样把她交给一个吸血鬼。对村民来说，一个生病的女孩，比起每晚生活在恐惧中，又算得了什么？但是当克丽娜遇到他时，贾瑞克-基尔科斯伯爵并不残忍，而是很温和。他没有把她喝干，留下她的蓝白色尸体作为对村子的警告。他没有像对待她哥哥那样扭断她的脖子。不，伯爵拥抱了她，用如此温柔的吻给了她他的礼物，她几乎感觉不到疼痛。",
	"The count's gift cured her and gave her a strength and confidence that she had never had before. The Count also gave her his name when he took her as his bride. She had begun her new life with him who had become both her second father, for he gave her this life, and her beloved husband. For the first time cruel fate, it seemed, had turned away from her. She had only been Countess Crina Kilcos for a short while when the village folk sent sellswords to slaughter her beloved Count and his servants. She only managed to survive the burning of the manor because of a gifted magic ring from the Count. She ran from the blazing manor and away from the village, vowing that one day the folk of Raven's Rest would bow down to the name of Kilcos once more. Though this time when they bow, it would be to a Countess, instead of a Count. And unlike them, she would not be cruel, but merciful. She would give them each a kiss, until all served her willingly in life, through blood-bound servitude or from the grave, but serve they shall...": "伯爵的礼物治愈了她，给了她前所未有的力量和信心。伯爵在娶她为妻时也给了她他的名字。她开始了她的新生活，他既是她的第二个父亲，因为他给了她这个生命，也是她心爱的丈夫。残酷的命运似乎第一次离她而去。当村里的人派人去屠杀她心爱的伯爵和他的仆人时，她只做了克里纳-基尔科斯伯爵夫人一小会儿。由于伯爵赠送的一枚魔法戒指，她才得以在庄园被烧毁时幸存下来。她从熊熊燃烧的庄园里跑出来，远离村庄，发誓有一天乌鸦之息的人们会再次向基尔科斯的名字低头。尽管这一次，当他们鞠躬时，将是向一位伯爵夫人，而不是向一位伯爵。与他们不同的是，她不会是残忍的，而是仁慈的。她会给他们每个人一个吻，直到所有人都心甘情愿地在生活中为她服务，通过血腥的奴役或从坟墓里出来，但他们必须服务......",
	"The adventure takes place in an isolated village nestled in a forested valley in the foothills of a chain of mountains. The village has the only inn within several days' journey and is one of the last places to stop for basic supplies if crossing the mountains in this region, so it sees more than its fair share of visitors. Most visitors do not stay long, as the place and its folk seem to be perpetually sour and gloomy. There is little or no mirth, but most are extremely tight lipped about the reasons for the mood of all the village folk. Most of the action in the adventure takes place in the ruins of the old manor house, which has once again become the lair of a vampire and her minions, though roleplaying and investigation take place in the village. If the PCs are made aware of the vampire's control of the region and try to leave, packs upon packs of wolves will drive them back to the village, where they will either become servants of the vampire or be made examples of what happens to those that would leave and be slain. It may seem odd, since they were just trying to leave, but Countess Crina Kilcos was less than sane before she was made into a vampire and lost the only man she had ever thought she loved, so she could never let any adventurers that may know about her escape, lest they return and do to her what they did to her beloved Count Jarek.": "冒险发生在一个与世隔绝的村庄，它坐落在一连串山脉的山脚下的森林山谷中。该村有几天路程内唯一的客栈，也是在这一地区翻山越岭时购买基本用品的最后一个地方，因此它的游客数量超过了其公平份额。大多数游客都不会停留太久，因为这个地方和它的居民似乎永远都很悲哀和忧郁。这里几乎没有欢笑，但大多数人对所有村子里的人的情绪的原因都讳莫如深。冒险中的大部分行动都发生在老庄园的废墟中，那里再次成为了一个吸血鬼和她的爪牙的巢穴，尽管角色扮演和调查都发生在村子里。如果NPC意识到吸血鬼对该地区的控制并试图离开，成群结队的狼会把他们赶回村子，在那里他们要么成为吸血鬼的仆人，要么成为那些离开和被杀的人的例子。这看起来很奇怪，因为他们只是想离开，但克丽娜-基尔科斯伯爵夫人在被变成吸血鬼并失去她唯一认为自己所爱的男人之前，是不太理智的，所以她绝对不能让任何可能知道她的冒险者逃跑，以免他们回来后像对待她心爱的亚雷克伯爵那样对待她。",
	"Alternatively, if the PCs don't go about their investigations quietly while in the town, when night falls the Countess will sender her {@creature vampiric minion|RolledTold6|minion vampires} and a {@creature vampire spawn} to deal with them until the PCs try to leave and run into the waiting wolves, who heard them back to the village to be slain by her, or until they assault her lair. The PCs are safe from attack int he village during the daylight hours, though not in the wooded hills outside the village, where the wolves stalk (see {@adventure At The Mercy of Her Pack|LadyLasingKisses|3|At The Mercy of Her Pack} sidebar).": "另外，如果NPC在镇上时没有安静地进行调查，当夜幕降临时，伯爵夫人会派她的（%0%）和一个（%1%）来对付他们，直到NPC试图离开并遇到等待的狼群，狼群会听到他们回村被她杀死，或者直到他们袭击她的巢穴。白天，NPC在村子里是安全的，不会受到攻击，但在村子外面的树林里就不一样了，那里有狼群在潜行（见{@adventure At The Mercy of Her Pack|LadyLasingKisses|3|At The Mercy of Her Pack}侧边栏）。",
	"If you need tips on how to run the villagers of Raven's Rest, think of village folk as if they were in an enemy occupied town that was always being watched, Most or all the folk either fear the vampire and her minions and are just trying to avoid trouble and keep to themselves, or they are informants that will turn in whatever happens in the village to the Countess and her minions. Most of those not already loyal to the vampire don't know which other villagers are loyal or what animals are under her control. It is rumored that the Countess, \"The White Lady\" as she is called by some, can control the hearts of beasts and see through their eyes. All the village folk know is that they are trapped, and any villagers who have tried to leave in the past either had their children taken, were slain and risen as {@creature zombie||zombies}, or turned into {@creature vampire spawn} and forced to drink one of their loved ones as punishment. So it will take some digging and convincing for the PCs to fully uncover the truth and not make the vampire aware of their plans.": "如果你需要关于如何管理乌鸦之息的村民的建议，可以把村里的人想成是在一个被敌人占领的城镇里，一直被监视着。大多数或所有的人要么害怕吸血鬼和她的爪牙，只是想避免麻烦和保持自我，要么他们是线人，会向伯爵夫人和她的爪牙举报村里发生的任何事情。那些尚未效忠于吸血鬼的人，大多不知道还有哪些村民效忠于她，也不知道哪些动物受她控制。有传言说，伯爵夫人，即一些人所称的 \"白女士\"，可以控制野兽的心脏，并通过它们的眼睛看到。村民们只知道他们被困住了，过去任何试图离开的村民要么被带走了他们的孩子，要么被杀后复活为（%0%），要么变成（%1%）并被迫喝下他们的亲人作为惩罚。因此，要想完全揭开真相，不让吸血鬼知道他们的计划，需要进行一些挖掘和说服工作。",
	"Most folk are curt, standoffish, or very sheepish if they have to interact with an outsider. The inn and any general services or trade are always fair, but far less than welcoming. The only reason anyone would stop here at all is because of its being the last place for supplies within several days' journey and the only inn for twice that distance—though, a warm, dry bed, a taste of ale, and a hot meal are not so enjoyable when provided only with the minimal of sour-faced grunts and interactions.": "如果要与外人打交道，大多数人都很客气、冷淡，或者非常腼腆。客栈和任何一般服务或贸易总是公平的，但远没有那么热情。人们会在这里停留的唯一原因是，它是几天路程内最后的补给地，也是两倍路程内唯一的客栈--虽然，如果只提供最低限度的酸脸咕哝和互动，那么一张温暖干燥的床、一口啤酒和一顿热饭就不那么令人愉快了。",

	"Countess Crina Kilcos is a thing of raw and ever-fluid emotions; her love is burning passion and her displeasure is burning hatred. Being such a powerful being and given her connection to the area and her many servants, those emotions are felt within the area of her influence. To simulate this in game terms, every 8 hours (while within 5 miles of the village in every direction, save the mountains, where it is only 2 miles) all the PCs must make a Charisma ability check to see how the White Lady feels about them. These checks determine two things. The first is how the Countess and her servants deal with the PC. The second is the strange physical and emotional connection the PCs experience because of being in her area of influence.": "克里娜-基尔科斯伯爵夫人是一个具有原始和不断流动的情感的东西；她的爱是燃烧的激情，她的不悦是燃烧的仇恨。作为一个强大的存在，鉴于她与这个地区和她的许多仆人的联系，这些情绪在她的影响范围内都能感受到。为了在游戏中模拟这一点，每隔8小时（在村庄的各个方向上都在5英里之内，除了山区，那里只有2英里），所有的NPC必须进行一次魅力能力检查，看看白夫人对他们的感觉如何。这些检查决定了两件事。第一件事是伯爵夫人和她的仆人是如何对待PC的。第二件事是NPC因为在她的影响范围内而经历的奇怪的身体和情感联系。",
	"The PC with the highest Charisma ability check is currently the focus of the Countess' affections. All her servants have orders not to slay the PC, but only to subdue and bring them to her so she may turn the PC into a vampire to rule beside her. The Countess herself is so enamored with the PC that she has disadvantage to do any injury to them. Any time the PC moves away from the village they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw or be counted as {@condition poisoned}, due to wild heart palpitations and the thunderous sounds of a heartbeat filling their ears until they return to at least the village area, if not the vampire lair.": "魅力值最高的人目前是伯爵夫人感情的焦点。她所有的仆人都被命令不要杀死这个人，而只是把他们制服并带到她面前，这样她就可以把这个人变成吸血鬼，在她身边统治。伯爵夫人自己也是如此迷恋PC，以至于她在对他们进行任何伤害时都处于不利地位。任何时候PC离开村子，他们都必须成功地完成一个{@dc 15}的魅力救赎，否则就会被算作{@condition poisoned}，因为疯狂的心悸和雷鸣般的心跳声充斥着他们的耳朵，直到他们回到至少是村子的区域，如果不是吸血鬼的巢穴。",
	"The Countess has taken an interest in the PC. Perhaps something about them reminds her of her beloved Count Jarek. Whatever the case, anytime the PC takes a short or long rest, they hear mewing purrs in their ears and feel as if cold hands are caressing them or icy lips kissing the backs of their necks.

	"The Countess finds the PC to resemble one of the foul adventurers that slew her beloved Jarek. Any of her servants have orders to attack this PC first and without mercy. All her servants go out of their way to focus attacks on this PC before doing anything to the others. Also, the Countess's hatred is so palpable that the PC can physically feel it. Each hour while under the Countess' vile hatred, the PC must succeed on a {@dc 10} Charisma saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion}, due to constant heart ache, upset stomach, and phantom pains as if something was trying to twist off their limbs and head.": "伯爵夫人发现这个人很像杀死她心爱的亚雷克的一个肮脏的冒险者。她的任何仆人都奉命首先攻击这个人，而且毫不留情。她所有的仆人在对其他人下手之前都会集中攻击这个人。另外，伯爵夫人的憎恨是如此明显，以至于个人电脑可以感觉到它。在伯爵夫人的憎恨下，每小时都必须成功地进行一次 \"魅力储蓄\"，否则就会因持续的心脏疼痛、胃部不适和仿佛有什么东西要从他们的四肢和头部扭下来的幻觉而遭受1%的痛苦。",

	"Also, it would be a good idea to thoroughly familiarize yourself with the {@creature vampire} and {@creature vampire spawn} stat blocks found in the core rulebooks, as the monsters are a bit complicated to run as a GM. The vampire has numerous abilities and actions that need to be used with grim purpose to give your players a truly harrowing experience, as it should be when facing off with one of the more powerful undead in the game. You will want to pay special note to the regional effects listed under a vampire's lair. These bits of flavor should be applied, not just within 500 feet of the lair, but for the entire adventure setting, to ramp up the creepy factor.": "此外，彻底熟悉核心规则书中的（%0%）和（%1%）状态块也是一个好主意，因为作为一个GM，这些怪物的操作有点复杂。吸血鬼有众多的能力和行动，需要严阵以待，给你的玩家带来真正的惨痛经历，当与游戏中更强大的亡灵对峙时，应该如此。你要特别注意吸血鬼巢穴下所列的区域效应。不仅仅是在巢穴的500英尺范围内，而且在整个冒险环境中，都应该应用这些味道，以增加惊悚的因素。",
	"The simplest way to insert this adventure into your campaign is when the PCs are heading through a mountainous area while in search for adventure. As an added challenge, you could slip this adventure right after another adventure set in a mountainous region.

	"I made the argument that, since I had \"{@optfeature Two-Weapon Fighting||two-weapon style}\" as one of my class features, I should still get a chance to throw a punch, since my GM wouldn't let me use it to free the sword.

	"Now, we were using one of the optional critical hit systems offered in 2E. Basically, if you rolled a 20, you had to \"confirm\" your critical hit with another attack roll. If you hit again, you got two damages to apply. If you missed with the confirmation roll, you only did one damage. But if you rolled a 20 on your confirmation roll, you got an additional confirmation roll... and so on. Theoretically, you could keep rolling 20s and keep stacking additional damage rolls atop each other. And that's exactly what I did.": "现在，我们使用的是2E中提供的一种可选的关键打击系统。基本上，如果你掷出了20分，你必须用另一个攻击卷来 \"确认 \"你的关键打击。如果你再次命中，你就有两个伤害可以应用。如果你的确认卷没打中，你就只造成了一次伤害。但如果你的确认卷是20，你就有一个额外的确认卷......以此类推。理论上，你可以不断地掷出20，并不断地将额外的伤害卷叠加在一起。而这正是我所做的。",
	"I rolled three 20s in a row, then I rolled an 18. My lowly punch was suddenly the equivalent of four successful attacks. I did so much non-lethal damage, against what was essentially an {@creature orc}, that I killed him.

	"As far as I was concerned, it changed the way I looked at my character. When I rolled my character, making unarmed combat one of his traits wasn't what I was looking for, but now it fit. My character was sort of the anti-Aragorn; he was of royal blood but his forebears were more tyrannical than noble, so he'd become a bandit. Making him a brawler was the missing piece that character concept needed.": "就我而言，它改变了我看待自己角色的方式。当我塑造我的角色时，将徒手格斗作为他的特征之一并不是我所追求的，但现在它适合了。我的角色有点像反阿拉贡；他有王室血统，但他的祖先更多的是暴政而不是贵族，所以他成了一个强盗。让他成为一个斗士是这个角色概念所需要的缺失部分。",
	"We played that campaign for a long time and that character was one of its defining elements. (Oh, and how I clowned my friends when they slipped up and called it the \"Blackwood campaign,\" which happened more than once.)

	"...or that critical miss.": "...或那个关键的失误。",
	"Now we get around to how all of this is relevant three editions later, in the here and now. The critical hit system in Fight Edition is... let's call it uninspiring. (One of the rare times the game lets me down. As far as I'm concerned, it's the best version of the game to date.) IT's just a regular old double damage system: Double your damage dice, but not your modifiers, and you're done. It's not special, it's not something to look forwards two... but at least it's there. But the game has no critical miss system.": "现在我们来谈谈这一切在三个版本之后，在此时此刻是如何相关的。搏击版中的关键打击系统......让我们称它为不令人振奋。(这是该游戏让我失望的少数情况之一。就我而言，这是该游戏迄今为止最好的版本。） 这只是一个普通的双倍伤害系统。将你的伤害骰子翻倍，但不包括你的修改器，你就完成了。这并不特别，也不值得期待......但至少它是存在的。但是游戏没有关键性失误系统。",
	"As far as critical misses, or critical fumbles as they were called then, 2nd Edition barely does anything with them, and 5E does nothing with them at all. I'm convinced they're as crucial, and fun, as a good critical hit system. Like critical hits, critical misses create moments.": "至于关键性失误，或者叫关键性失误，第二版几乎没有对它们做任何处理，而5E根本没有对它们做任何处理。我相信它们和一个好的关键打击系统一样重要，也很有趣。就像关键一击一样，关键失误也创造了一些时刻。",
	"In the above example, I never would have thrown the punch had I not rolled a 1 and gotten my sword stuck in the tree. The critical miss created an obstacle for me to overcome. It forced me to think about something besides swinging my sword, my go-to move. I'll grant you that opting for a thrown punch isn't exactly the work of a master tactician, but I was trying to make the rules work for me, and I did... and it changed our whole campaign.": "在上面的例子中，如果我没有掷出1而使我的剑卡在树上，我就不会打出这一拳。这个关键的失误为我创造了一个需要克服的障碍。它迫使我考虑除了挥剑之外的事情，我的常用动作。我承认选择出拳并不完全是战术大师的杰作，但我试图让规则为我所用，我做到了......而且它改变了我们整个战役。",
	"...I'm not saying that a kick-ass critical hit is going to be what makes a campaign great, but I believe that great adventures and great campaigns have signature moments...": "......我并不是说，一个踢屁股的关键一击就能使一个活动变得伟大，但我相信，伟大的冒险和伟大的活动都有标志性的时刻......。",
	"Now, we were using a different supplement for our critical misses. My GM had a copy of {@i The Best Dragon Magazine Vol. 4}, and one of the articles within was about critical misses.": "现在，我们在使用不同的补充资料来处理我们的关键失误。我的总经理有一本{@i The Best Dragon Magazine Vol. 4}，其中有一篇文章是关于关键失误的。",
	"This article had a focus on weapons being damages when a 1 was rolled, but it also included adding negative conditions like being disarmed, or even injuring oneself or a fellow party member. There were three tables, and two of those were extensive enough to require percentile tables rather than d20 or smaller, and there were time factors and yadda yadda yadda.": "这篇文章的重点是，当掷出1时，武器会受到损害，但也包括增加负面条件，如被缴械，甚至伤害自己或同党成员。有三张表，其中两张表的范围大到需要百分位数表，而不是D20或更小的表，还有时间因素和哒哒哒哒哒。",
	"The beauty of 5E is how streamlined it is and doing research for this article really bears that out. I've loved almost every edition (except for the cursed 4th, of which we shall not speak), but looking back at the rules for 2nd Edition, the const of entry was just too high in terms of time investment. The older versions of the game were the bomb, but looking back on them now, they suffered from being excessively wordy, complicated, and humorless. The add-ons were pretty cool, though.": "5E的魅力在于它的精简，为这篇文章做研究确实证明了这一点。我几乎喜欢每一个版本（除了被诅咒的第四版，我们不应谈论它），但回顾第二版的规则，就时间投资而言，入门的限制实在太高了。游戏的老版本是炸弹，但现在回过头来看，它们的缺点是过于冗长、复杂和缺乏幽默感。不过，附加功能还是很不错的。",
	"The game was complicated because it was complex and every new thing added a layer of customization that I dig to this day. But critical hits and misses don't need to be complex. Like the rest of combat, they should be simple and fun. I favor {@variantrule Alternative Criticals|RolledTold1|a simple set of rules}:": "这个游戏之所以复杂，是因为它很复杂，每一个新事物都增加了一层定制，我至今都在挖掘。但关键的命中和失误并不需要复杂。就像战斗的其他部分一样，它们应该是简单而有趣的。我赞成（%0%）。",

	"Rolling a 20 or a 1 is already pretty badass, because a 20 always hits and a 1 always misses. Getting actual extra damage requires another successful attack roll, and every additional 20 or additional 1 earns you another set of damage to roll for (or an additional penalty). Does extra damage include bonuses like strength or magical bonuses, conventional wisdom says no... a critical hit doesn't mean you got stronger or that your sword got more magical. But you do you. Does a character get advantage or disadvantage on the confirmation roll? Again, I'd say no, but that sounds like a situational consideration to me. Note: where a confirmation roll for a critical hit is another successful attack roll, a critical miss should be confirmed by another failed attack roll!": "掷出20或1已经很厉害了，因为20总是命中，1总是不中。获得实际的额外伤害需要另一次成功的攻击卷，而每一个额外的20或额外的1都会为你赢得另一组伤害卷（或一个额外的惩罚）。额外的伤害是否包括像力量或魔法的奖励，传统智慧认为不包括......关键一击并不意味着你变得更强壮或你的剑变得更有魔力。但你确实是你。一个角色在确认卷上获得优势或劣势吗？同样，我说没有，但这在我看来是一种情景考虑。注意：如果一个关键打击的确认卷是另一个成功的攻击卷，那么一个关键的失误应该由另一个失败的攻击卷来确认。",
	"A critical hit is all about damage, because that's really all that anybody wants it to be about. Critical misses can and occasionally should result in damaging oneself or another party member, but that's not where I think the fun lies. I think the fun lies in negative conditions. It makes more sense to knock oneself {@condition prone} (or {@condition unconscious}!) than simply to do damage to oneself. Or maybe the encounter has a goal, and the critical miss moves the party a step back from that goal. As far as stacking goes, you can worsen the condition, say from {@condition incapacitated} to {@condition unconscious}, or you can add to the duration of the condition, say from one round to {@dice d4} rounds.": "关键一击是关于伤害的，因为这确实是所有人都希望它是关于伤害的。关键性失误可以而且偶尔应该导致伤害自己或另一个党员，但这不是我认为的乐趣所在。我认为乐趣在于负面条件。把自己打倒（%0%）（或（%1%）！）比简单地对自己造成伤害更有意义。或者说，这场遭遇战有一个目标，而关键性的失误使当事人离这个目标又退了一步。至于叠加的问题，你可以使病情恶化，比如从（2%）到（3%），或者你可以增加病情的持续时间，比如从一回合到（4%）回合。",
	"Honestly, that's as complicated as I think this needs to be. I'll put a wee chart at the end of this article, so you can randomly generate appropriate negative conditions. It won't be exhaustive; you can sub out conditions as you see fit. (Is the parting fighting a tentacle monster? Sub in the {@condition grappled} condition! Are they fighting a medusa? A character might stumble into her line of sight, so add the {@condition petrified} condition!)": "老实说，这和我认为需要的复杂程度一样。我将在本文末尾放一个小图表，这样你就可以随机产生适当的负面条件。它不会是详尽无遗的；你可以根据你认为合适的条件进行细分。(分身是在和触手怪物战斗吗？代入（%0%）条件！）。他们是在和冥王星战斗吗？一个角色可能会绊倒在她的视线里，所以要加上（%1%）的条件！)",

Do what works for you.": "你可以根据自己的情况来定制；让它发挥作用。也许，如果你的玩家在确认卷中失败，你就决定他们自动造成最大伤害。也许确认关键一击可以激活一种力量，或者恢复一种力量的使用。也许一个关键的失误会导致他们的伪装失败，而不是产生任何形式的战斗效果。做适合你的事。",
	"This is not a crit system that is likely to grow out of control. No body locations, no crazy charts or rolls, no real work on the GM's part. Lest you worry about PCs stomping around ripping off mega-stacks of crits, I should say that in the entire duration of that 5+ year campaign, it only happened twice... and I was the guy that rolled them both times. (Maybe someday I'll tell you guys about the {@monster cave fisher|VGM}!) The odds of rolling two 20s in a row are 1 in 400.

This way, you can slaughter them with a clear conscience and a \"What did you think the ogre meant by 'Me mates is gonna eat ya fer dis,' that he bleated before he died?\" or a \"Nobody forced you guys to charge into a cave you knew had ogres in it without scouting it out first. I mean the ogre you guys killed that was dragging the dead goat was headed someplace.\"": "敌人的预示也是一个很好的方法，当你的玩家准备进入一个区域或进行一场远远超出他们能力范围的战斗时，可以警告他们。这样一来，你就不必说 \"你们可能要重新考虑一下 \"这句老话。只要让他们尝尝即将发生的事情，让他们做出决定。仅仅因为玩家是2级，并不意味着他们选择的每条路都有一个平衡的遭遇在等着他们去做最好。{@creature ogre||Ogres}、巨人、{@creature orc}部落和龙都得有地方住。在一个活生生的世界里，有时人物应该跑，而不是打。这样一来，你就可以问心无愧地屠杀他们，并且可以说：\"你认为食人魔在死前说的'我的伙伴们要吃了你'是什么意思？\"或者说：\"没有人强迫你们在没有事先侦察的情况下冲进一个你们知道有食人魔的山洞里。我是说你们杀死的那个拖着死山羊的食人魔是要去某个地方的。\"",
	"This one feels dangerous to your players. An ambush will put them on their heels, but a push-over ambush keeps you from killing them in the process. It also lets the players think that the bad guys have either badly underestimated them, or it makes them feel totally tough when they turn the tables on the ambushers. It can be combined with Foe Foreshadowing or The Clue-by-Four to do double-duty tactical excitement and helpful info.": "这个对你的玩家来说感觉很危险。埋伏会让他们束手无策，但推倒性的埋伏能让你在这个过程中不至于杀死他们。这也让玩家认为，坏人要么严重低估了他们，要么让他们在反击伏击者的时候感觉到完全的强硬。它可以与 \"敌人预示 \"或 \"线索四 \"结合起来，实现战术刺激和有用信息的双重作用。",

Now you have 2 normal gnolls and 20 paper tiger or minion gnolls. When us a battle kicks off, your players will be more than worried when they are facing what looks like 22 gnolls! Facing down hordes of foes (even 1 hp foes) makes for epic battles, and even more so than an Inadequate Ambush. It makes all the players feel like heroes. It is a bit more dangerous, but way too cool not to use every couple of games.": "是时候让NPC认为他们陷入了困境，他们认为应该有三到四倍的敌人出现在战斗中，因为确实有这样的敌人! 从两个你想使用的全状态的敌人开始，比如说（%0%）--现在我们需要一大群这样的小动物；这就是小兵的作用（使用（%1%）状态块，但将它们的AC降低2，并使它们只有1个命中率）。现在你有2个正常的地精和20个纸老虎或奴才地精。当我们的战斗开始时，当你的玩家面对看起来像22个地精的时候，他们会更加担心！这时，你就会发现，你的玩家在面对成群的地精。面对成群结队的敌人（即使是1HP的敌人），会产生史诗般的战斗，甚至比不适当的伏击更有意义。这让所有玩家都觉得自己是英雄。这有点危险，但太酷了，不能每两场都用。",

Perhaps an NPC they met earlier is one of the now dead cultists at the PCs' feet. Maybe the Clue-By-Four lets them know they are up against a cult. It lets them know where to start looking for the missing folk or at least pushes them onto the cult's trail in some way. That is hitting your players over the heads with a Clue-by-Four without having to blatantly tell them. This way they think they figured something out and you don't have to break the fort wall to tell them and railroad them as to what to do.": "假设你正在运行一个涉及到对付邪教的游戏--但是玩家们错过了一些重要的线索，导致他们发现自己所有的失踪都是由于邪教带走了他们，而且玩家们都看起来很无聊，很烦躁，或者很茫然。用一些邪教分子伏击他们。这不仅会让桌子滚动起来，而且故事也会有进展。现在他们发现了你插入的线索：邪教是怎么回事。也许他们之前遇到的一个NPC就是现在死在NPC脚下的邪教分子之一。也许 \"线索四 \"让他们知道他们是在对抗一个邪教。它让他们知道从哪里开始寻找失踪的人，或者至少以某种方式把他们推到邪教的线索上。这就是用 \"四条线索 \"来打动你的玩家，而不需要公然告诉他们。这样一来，他们就会认为自己想通了，而你也不必打破堡垒来告诉他们，并让他们知道该怎么做。",

	"It gets all the players fully engaged, and, if they are not careful, takes a few resources—spell slots, magic item charges, potions, limited use feats, and abilities. I also like to use a warm-up attack right before the PCs face off with a big bad. Sure, it is cool to take out a pile of folks with a well-timed {@spell fireball}, but the party will be missing that 3rd-level spell slot when the {@creature lich} hurls their own {@spell fireball} an it is cast with a 9th-level spell slot. Sure could have used an extra {@spell counterspell} to stop that 20-ft. radius, {@damage 14d6} of fiery death coming at the party. So this is not only fun, but a way to teach your players resource conservation.": "它让所有的玩家都参与进来，而且如果他们不小心的话，就会占用一些资源--法术槽、魔法物品费用、药水、有限使用的功法和能力。我还喜欢在NPC与一个大坏蛋对峙之前使用热身攻击。当然，用一个适时的（%0%）干掉一堆人是很酷的，但是当（%1%）投掷他们自己的（%2%）时，聚会将缺少那个3级法术槽，而这个法术槽是用9级法术槽施放的。当然可以用一个额外的{@spell counterspell}来阻止那20英尺半径的{@damage 14d6}火热的死亡向派对袭来。因此，这不仅是一种乐趣，也是一种教你的玩家节约资源的方法。",
	"It's just what it says. Maybe the game session you planned is going to be or was heavy on roleplaying? Well, as a good GM you need to try and include everyone. The {@race half-orc} {@class barbarian} with the Charisma of 6 is not going to have much to do when the game is about negotiations. Sure, they can stand around and look menacing and be ready if things go bad, but if they don't you now have a player who came to your table and got to do little or nothing. I can tell you, that is far from cool. No matter how engaging you think your game or story is, a little combat is kind of a necessity in tabletop gaming. To that thought, this is where There Will Be Blood comes in. Start, slip in, or end a session with a short and easy combat. It doesn't take a pile of planning on your part, and it keeps everybody happy.": "这只是它所说的。也许你计划的游戏环节将是或者是重在角色扮演的？那么，作为一个好的GM，你需要尝试包括每个人。当游戏是关于谈判的时候，那个魅力值为6的{@race half-orc}{@class barbarian}的人是不会有什么作为的。当然，他们可以站在一旁，看起来气势汹汹，并在事情变坏时做好准备，但如果他们不这样做，你现在就有一个来到你的桌子上的玩家，而他几乎什么都没有做。我可以告诉你，这远远不够酷。无论你认为你的游戏或故事有多吸引人，在桌面游戏中，少量的战斗是一种必需品。对于这种想法，这就是《会流血的》的作用。以短小精悍的战斗开始、滑入或结束一个环节。它不需要你做大量的计划，而且能让每个人都高兴。",

There is no limit to what a friend can do for you, on and off table.": "朋友能为你提供什么？他们知道哪里有好吃的东西，有很好的石头收藏，也知道当地的好乐队。在桌面游戏中，他们可以是加入团队一段时间的NPC，引导你进行有利可图的副线任务，或者帮助团队成员与失踪的朋友重聚。朋友可以为你做的事情是无限的，不管是在桌面上还是在桌面下。",

	"Let's be frank—as far as we know, most RPG manuals were written from the point of views of humans, ergo the default point of view IS human. Even if the lands are equally split between {@race human||humans}, {@race elf||elves}, {@race orc|ERLW|orcs}, {@race goblin|VGM|goblins}, {@race tiefling||tieflings}, etc., your GM will mostly likely operate under the idea of humans as default. Also, playing as a quote-unquote monster and putting yourself into their shoes (or horns) will give you insight to use when befriending the same species in the future.": "让我们坦率地说，据我们所知，大多数RPG手册都是从人类的角度写的，因此默认的观点就是人类。即使土地在{@race human||humans}、{@race elf||elves}、{@race orc|ERLW|orcs}、{@race goblin|VGM|goblins}、{@race tiefling||tieflings}等之间平分秋色，你的GM也很有可能以人类为默认观点来操作。另外，扮演一个引号中的怪物，把自己放在他们的鞋子（或角）里，会让你在将来与同一物种交好时有深刻的认识。",

I'm partial to demonic monsters like {@race tiefling||tieflings} (basically like {@creature gargoyle||gargoyles}, born from evil magicks). Sometimes I add a twist playing them as if they've escaped the limiting confines and expectations of their species. The play of nature vs nurture is a narrative thread you can all use! Think of if in the \"real world\" a friend grew up in a meat-eating household but wants to learn more about plant-based diets and experiment with making meals without meat. They are getting to play with their food (har har) and you can do the same at your tabletop game.": "这就是为什么在手册中扮演其他东西是如此的丰富和叙事上的乐趣。我偏爱像{@race tiefling||tieflings}这样的恶魔怪物（基本上像{@creature gargoyle||gargoyles}，从邪恶的魔法中诞生）。有时我还会加入一个转折点，把他们扮演成摆脱了其物种的限制和期望。天性与教养的博弈是一条叙事线索，你们都可以使用! 想一想，如果在 \"现实世界 \"中，一个朋友在一个吃肉的家庭中长大，但想更多地了解以植物为基础的饮食，并尝试做没有肉的饭。他们正在玩弄他们的食物（哈哈），你可以在你的桌面游戏中做同样的事情。",

	"It was a \"perfect\" campaign... for me.": "这是一场 \"完美 \"的运动......对我来说。",
	"Unfortunately, my players had different interest. The party would forget NPC names, lose track of goals, get hyper-focused on the wrong details, get stuck on riddles, or worse, one player would solve everything while the rest of the party floated by. I had crafted a water park for the players, but they didn't want to wait in line for the rides. I was focused on the events instead of how to get my players invested.": "不幸的是，我的玩家有不同的兴趣。队员们会忘记NPC的名字，失去目标，过度关注错误的细节，被谜语卡住，或者更糟糕的是，一个队员解决了所有的问题，而其他队员却飘飘然了。我为玩家们设计了一个水上公园，但他们不想排队等候游乐设施。我把注意力放在事件上，而不是如何让我的玩家投入。",
	"The easiest way to get your players invested is to build the campaign around them. A topic that is rarely discussed is the tone of an adventure. Some people want dark brooding grimdark adventures where everyone's a backstabbing villain; other people want a little dark but overall uplifting experience. Before starting your campaign it's wise to discuss the tone of the game with your party. It also helps to look at their lives outside of the campaign.": "让你的玩家投入的最简单的方法是围绕他们建立活动。一个很少被讨论的话题是冒险的基调。有些人想要黑暗的、阴暗的、每个人都在背后捅刀子的冒险；另一些人则想要有点黑暗但总体上令人振奋的体验。在开始你的活动之前，与你的队伍讨论游戏的基调是明智的。看看他们在活动之外的生活也有帮助。",

	"My most successful NPC came by accident. In an adventure the players were attacked by a group of {@creature goblin||goblins}, combat was nearly over, and one goblin was left. I had written some backstory for this area and wanted to add some spice to the mix, so I had him throw down his weapon and say how sorry he was.

His name was \"Stomp\" and he spoke in a small, apologetic voice.": "我最成功的NPC是偶然出现的。在一次冒险中，玩家被一群{@creature goblin||goblins}攻击，战斗几乎结束，只剩下一个小妖精。我为这个地区写了一些背景故事，想给这个组合添加一些调味品，所以我让他扔下武器，说他很抱歉。他的部落被一个叫 \"狼 \"的野兽胁迫着去攻击旅行者。真正吸引人的是他的角色。他的名字叫 \"跺脚\"，说话时声音很小，带着歉意。",
	"What I didn't expect was the group to basically adopt him. They fed him, brushed his hair and had him lead them to his tribe where they liberated them from \"The Wolf\" (a level 7 {@race orc|VGM} {@class fighter}/jerk).

	"Stomp gave the players something to care about in this world.": "跺脚》给了玩家在这个世界上值得关心的东西。",
	"This is probably the most well-known pillar of table top gaming. What makes a thrilling game is a source of debate and friendly contention. I think it's important to acknowledge that sometimes the most thrilling experience is NOT combat.

Here are some ideas that will help get started.": "这可能是桌面游戏中最知名的支柱。什么是惊心动魄的游戏是辩论和友好争论的来源。我认为必须承认，有时最惊心动魄的体验不是战斗。有时它是胁迫外交官提供信息，以调情的方式通过保镖，或者在矮人战队中喝得酩酊大醉。你在使你的冒险惊心动魄方面有困难吗？这里有一些想法，可以帮助你开始。",
	"Paint your group's party as false villains. did they save a town from burning OR did they start the fire and extort the village to put out the fire in exchange for gold?! another version of this is build a \"rival\" group of adventurers who your party gets mistaken for.

	"If you are intent on focusing on combat let me suggest one fun little trick! In one particularly action-based session the players had about 10 minutes to make it through a series of encounters. To make it more exciting, I put an actual timer on the table. The players had 10 real minutes to do what they had to do. I had never seen my players make decisions so quickly! While this is a fun mechanism, don't do it often. It may be too stressful for some people. I know several people who really appreciate how much time they can think about their new move.": "如果你打算把注意力集中在战斗上，让我建议一个有趣的小技巧 在一个特别以行动为基础的会议中，玩家有大约10分钟的时间来完成一系列的遭遇战。为了让它更刺激，我在桌子上放了一个真正的计时器。玩家们有10分钟的时间来做他们必须做的事情。我从未见过我的玩家如此迅速地做出决定！这是很有趣的机制。虽然这是一个有趣的机制，但不要经常这样做。对某些人来说，这可能太有压力了。我认识几个人，他们非常欣赏有这么多时间来考虑他们的新棋。",
	"How do we make players excited for future adventures?": "我们如何让玩家对未来的冒险感到兴奋？",
	"Recurring villains! Ancient prophecies! Looming disaster! Exposition! What will make your players stoked to come back to the table? What will they think about when they're on break from work? This doesn't need to be a literal villain. Sometimes a concept can be strong enough to keep your players curious. I consume a lot of media and often take notes of how much a film or book will hint at something before showing it. Have an upcoming spooky ice dungeon? Throw in some chilly dialog in your NPCs. Be subtle, but emphatic with your hints!": "反复出现的反派人物! 古老的预言! 迫在眉睫的灾难! 解释！？什么会让你的玩家兴奋地回到游戏桌前？他们在休息的时候会想些什么？这不需要是一个字面上的小人。有时候，一个概念就足以让你的玩家保持好奇心。我消费了很多媒体，并经常记下一部电影或一本书在展示之前会暗示多少东西。有一个即将到来的阴森恐怖的冰雪地牢吗？在你的NPC中抛出一些寒冷的对话。暗示要微妙，但要强调。",
	"Another method is to expand your focus on world building. Do the players travel to the same place frequently? Have their favorite NPCs grow over time. Magnar the Beautiful has opened his first barbershop! Stomp the Goblin has set up a trade route between his tribe and the town. The guard who runs the gate had a kid and named it after one of your players. Spend a little time on it, make a chart showing your progress. These kinds of moments give your world depth, which will have your players starting to ask questions like \"What else is happening in this world?\" which will excite them to explore and investigate your game every session!": "另一个方法是扩大你对世界建设的关注。玩家们是否经常到同一个地方旅行？让他们喜欢的NPC随着时间的推移而成长。美丽的马格纳已经开了他的第一家理发店 地精Stomp已经在他的部落和城镇之间建立了一条贸易路线。管理大门的警卫有了一个孩子，并以你的一个玩家的名字命名。在这上面花点时间，做个图表显示你的进展。这类时刻赋予你的世界以深度，这将使你的玩家开始问一些问题，比如 \"这个世界上还发生了什么？\"这将使他们在每一节课上都兴奋地探索和研究你的游戏",

	"A great way to ensure your players are satisfied is to set up goals for them to accomplish. When designing your adventures make sure you build easy- and hard-to-achieve goals. Set up the situation so they save the prince, but the kidnapper has escaped. You can only do this so many times before the players will assume they can't catch the kidnapper. An alternative route is to catch the kidnapper and find out they were hired! BUT BY WHOM?! That's up to you. NPC friendly backstabs can be fun, but don't break your player's trust.": "确保你的玩家感到满意的一个好方法是为他们设定目标，让他们去完成。在设计你的冒险时，确保你建立了容易实现和难以实现的目标。设置的情况是，他们救了王子，但绑匪却逃跑了。你只能这样做很多次，否则玩家会认为他们抓不到绑匪。另一条路线是抓住绑匪，发现他们是被雇佣的！但是谁？但是，是谁？这就取决于你了。NPC友好的反击可以很有趣，但不要破坏玩家的信任。",

That was done way back in 1985 by Atari Games when they brough us Gauntlet, in all its massive standing cabinet, hack-and-slashing, \"Red Warrior needs food badly!\", \"Green Elf is about to die!\" 8-bit glory. For crusty old gamers like myself who have been rolling funky shaped dice and scratching crazy Gygaxian dungeons on graph paper since I was ten in 1981, Gauntlet showed me (to my players' chagrin and joy) that tides of enemies rolling towards you cannot only be cool, heroic, and fear inducing, but a needed component of my game.": "我不会假装自己发明了产卵机制。早在1985年，雅达利游戏公司就已经这样做了，当时他们给我们带来了Gauntlet，在其所有的大型立柜、砍杀、\"红色战士非常需要食物！\"、\"绿色精灵即将死亡！\" 8位的荣耀。对于像我这样从1981年10岁起就开始滚动时髦的骰子并在绘图纸上划出疯狂的Gygaxian地牢的老玩家来说，Gauntlet向我展示了（让我的玩家感到懊恼和高兴的是），敌人潮水般向你涌来，不仅很酷，很有英雄气概，而且能引起恐惧，是我游戏中需要的组成部分。",

The best example I can think of is Peter Jackson's version of Lord of the Rings. In Fellowship alone, Jackson gives us awesome examples of spawning monsters. He gives a tide of goblins along with their pet cave troll in the Mines of Moria scenes. We see our beloved heroes—backs to the wall, weapons at the ready—and a cave troll comes crashing into the tomb, a tide of rabid goblins in tow! If that doesn't blow your hair back, how about a mass horde of Uruk-hai orcs flooding through the hilly forest bellowing \"Find the Halfling!\" The battles are in-your-face furious, wild and glorious action. You can get the same effects at your game table with spawn mechanics.": "如果你需要比我强得多的人的例子，你不需要再去看一些被我们共同的极客粉丝所喜爱的电影。我能想到的最好的例子是彼得-杰克逊版本的《指环王》。仅在《团聚》中，杰克逊就给我们提供了催生怪物的可怕例子。他在莫里亚矿区的场景中，给了一潮的地精和他们的宠物洞穴巨魔。我们看到我们心爱的英雄们--背对着墙，准备好武器--而一个洞穴巨魔冲进了墓穴，一群狂暴的妖精在后面拖着！如果这还不能让你的头发飘起来的话，那么，你就会发现，我们的英雄们是如此的强大。如果这还不能把你的头发吹乱，那么大批乌鲁克-海族兽人涌入丘陵森林，吼叫着 \"找到那个半身人！\"又如何呢？这些战斗是当面的愤怒、狂野和辉煌的行动。你可以在你的游戏桌上用产卵机制获得同样的效果。",
	"To be up front and fully truthful, using spawn mechanics is not only disregarding every rule on building encounters in the rulebooks, but more so shooting them dead. This will make every rules-lawyer cringe and clutch their oh-so-manipulated core rulebooks to their chest and accuse you of blasphemy! Let them. Because sometimes you have to think (or in this case play) out of the box. Being a Game Master isn't always easy. Nor is the task of keeping your players engaged, entertained, and ready to come back next session for more. We sacred few who take up our screens and produce game after game of goodness for our players need all the help we can get. We need a bag of tricks to keep things from getting boring.

	"What your players get for putting up with, thwarting, or merely surviving your spawn encounter. It could be simple XP or some other story element, goal, or loot, figuring XP is just a general guideline more than a hard and fast rule.

Add 10% of the base XP (or +10 or +20 XP in our Spawner examples) bonus for each round the spawner is active, dependent on how nasty the monsters or situation is.": "你的玩家在忍受、挫败或仅仅是在你的产卵遭遇中幸存下来后会得到什么。它可以是简单的XP，也可以是一些其他的故事元素、目标或战利品，计算XP只是一个一般的准则，而不是一个硬性的规则。拿出你计划产卵的怪物的基本XP，然后乘以4作为产卵者的基本XP（如果你以某种方式减少或限制怪物，或者如果有来自NPC的有利奖励，则乘以2）。在产卵器的每一轮活动中，增加基础XP的10%（或者在我们的产卵器例子中是+10或+20 XP）的奖励，这取决于怪物或情况有多恶劣。",

	"Likewise, a player character's former love interests can provide tangible links to that character's origins. Were they apprenticed with the same swordmaster? Did one keep lookout while the other got up to mischief in the temple when both were acolytes? Did they both come from the same small farming community, before the player character was renowned as a hero?

These responses all provide for some great development and roleplaying opportunities around the table.": "此外，这类角色的存在不仅为浪漫的兴趣增加了发展。党派的无赖如何看待他的好朋友把所有时间都花在他身上的小姑娘，当党派成员的爱人偷偷摸摸地走到他们身边，求他们保护他们的爱人时，战士如何回应？这些反应都提供了一些很好的发展和角色扮演的机会，在桌子周围。",
	"One of the elements that can't be understated about relationships (romantic, certainly, but all relationships to some degree) is that they cause characters to become involved in one another's lives in direct ways. The events in an NPC's life are no longer things happening to someone else at that point—they affect the player character, as well.

	"On a practical level, this bypasses one of the major awkward elements of romance in gaming: the Game Master telling a player that their character is attracted to someone. Using this technique, it keeps the decision for whom the character might be interested in within the player's hands, while making them available for the narrator to introduce and leverage that initial attraction in a predictable way.": "在实践层面上，这绕过了游戏中浪漫的主要尴尬因素之一：游戏管理员告诉玩家他们的角色被某人吸引。使用这种技术，它使角色可能对谁感兴趣的决定权掌握在玩家手中，同时使他们可以让叙述者以一种可预测的方式介绍和利用这种最初的吸引力。",
	"Plus, it's kind of a fun reveal with unexpected ramifications around the table: When the Game Master shows the image of the tyrant's daughter to the group, one of the players realizes it's one of his romantic gallery images, and so knows to roleplay that immediate (possibly dangerous) sense of being smitten in whatever way is appropriate to his character.": "另外，这也是一个有趣的揭示，在桌子周围有意想不到的影响。当游戏管理员向大家展示暴君女儿的图像时，其中一个玩家意识到这是他的浪漫画廊图像之一，因此知道以适合他的角色的任何方式来扮演那种立即（可能是危险的）被迷惑的感觉。",
	"As you introduce potential romantic interests, email or talk to players outside of the game, individually, to gauge their interest in taking part in that sort of plotline. There's nothing that says romance (or any subplot, really) has to arise spontaneously at the table—rest assured, there will be more than enough spontaneity in play as the demands of the campaign impact that relationship.": "当你介绍潜在的恋爱对象时，可以在游戏之外单独发电子邮件或与玩家交谈，以衡量他们对参与这种情节的兴趣。没有什么规定说浪漫（或任何子情节，真的）必须在游戏桌上自发产生--请放心，在游戏中会有足够的自发性，因为活动的要求会影响这种关系。",

	"Though there's nothing wrong with a quick social check here and there to determine how well someone comports themselves, remember that charismatic people are not the only ones who fall in love. Flirtation or even a seduction might answer to the dice, but don't relegate the success or failure of a romance to the dice or other mechanic. It should be a story element, and roleplaying-focused, not a matter of \"winning\" at a dice roll.": "虽然在这里和那里进行快速的社交检查以确定某人的表现如何并无不妥，但请记住，有魅力的人并不是唯一会陷入爱情的人。调情甚至诱惑都可以用骰子来回答，但不要把恋爱的成败归结于骰子或其他机制。它应该是一个故事元素，并以角色扮演为重点，而不是在掷骰子时 \"获胜 \"的问题。",
	"Along those lines, neither should romance be a \"reward\" for victory. As prevalent as \"winning the hand of the lady fair by slaying the dragon\" tropes are in Western fiction, it's not a good model for gaming (and is really a throwback to women being considered property, and that's definitely an unwelcome reference at the gaming table).": "沿着这些思路，浪漫也不应该成为胜利的 \"奖励\"。尽管在西方小说中，\"通过屠龙来赢得美女的青睐 \"的说法很普遍，但这并不是一个好的游戏模式（这实际上是女性被视为财产的一种回归，而这绝对是游戏桌上不受欢迎的参考）。",
	"This isn't to say that romantic interests can't be impressed by our player character's heroic actions. Far from it!

We were all kids, so our resources were tied exclusively to birthdays and holidays. Every new expansion book required us to pool our money together, and we had to look for spare change just so we could photocopy character sheets. More often than not we went without rather than having a miniature that actually resembled our characters. The Wizard with the Missing Arm had to double as the Rogue, the Psionicist, the Owlbear, and even the Gelatinous Cube. We erased the names and stats on the character sheet over and over again until the entire paper was smudged gray on both sides. Somehow, we made it work. You can too.": "我第一次学会玩桌面角色扮演游戏是在一本过期的玩家手册上，那本手册的封面不见了。我很确定我的一个朋友在旧货市场找到了它。我们都是孩子，所以我们的资源完全与生日和假期挂钩。每一本新的扩展书都需要我们把钱集中起来，我们不得不寻找零钱，以便能够复印角色表。更多的时候，我们没有钱，而不是拥有一个真正与我们的角色相似的微型模型。缺胳膊的巫师不得不兼任游侠、幻术师、猫头鹰熊，甚至是胶质立方体。我们一遍又一遍地擦掉角色表上的名字和数据，直到整张纸的两面都被弄成灰色。不知何故，我们成功了。你也可以。",
	"Gaming manuals are a big investment in playing these games. Some groups have access to multiple rulebooks, but for most of my life players shared a single copy of these sacred texts. Thankfully, that is now less of an issue because: The Internet. Most modern game systems have the rules for character creation posted on their websites. In addition, game designers and players have made incredible resources to reference and search for specific rules. At my table I try to use the books as little as possible. I encourage players to design their own prestige classes or modify an existing power or feat to better suit their characters (within reason). I also challenge myself to come up with original monsters whenever possible. If there's a monster I want to include in an adventure but don't have access to their real stats, I make it up and nobody ever notices.": "游戏手册是玩这些游戏的一项重要投资。有些团体可以获得多本规则书，但在我生活的大部分时间里，玩家们只共享这些神圣文本的一个副本。值得庆幸的是，现在这已经不是一个问题了，因为。互联网。大多数现代游戏系统都在其网站上发布了创建角色的规则。此外，游戏设计者和玩家还制作了令人难以置信的资源来参考和搜索具体规则。在我的桌子上，我尽量少用书本。我鼓励玩家设计自己的声望等级，或者修改现有的能力或特技以更好地适应他们的角色（在合理范围内）。我还挑战自己，在可能的情况下想出原创怪物。如果我想在冒险中加入一个怪物，但又无法获得它们的真实数据，我就会编造它，而且没人注意到。",

Many libraries regularly host game nights, and if yours doesn't, it doesn't hurt to ask. Someone at your local library is in charge of events like story times or study room sessions or adult education classes. Talk to them.": "说到这里，很多玩家根本无法主持一场比赛。在家庭、室友和小公寓之间，让五个或更多的朋友来玩可能是不可能的。较高的城市有像游戏咖啡馆这样的选择，但那些咖啡馆往往需要门票才能进入，或者需要最低限度的食物/饮料订单。图书馆和学校是一个很好的选择。许多图书馆定期举办游戏之夜，如果你的图书馆没有，问问也无妨。你当地的图书馆有人负责故事时间、自习室课程或成人教育课程等活动。跟他们谈谈。",
	"Students also have other public spaces where they can game: namely classrooms. In my younger years, my friends and I routinely played in one of our chemistry teacher's rooms. Teachers work super hard and have to stay late every day. Take advantage of this by asking your favorite teacher to let you run some games there. The risk here is that if your teacher is cool enough to let you run RPGs in their classroom, they might want to join in.": "学生们也有其他可以游戏的公共空间：即教室。在我年轻的时候，我的朋友和我经常在我们化学老师的一个房间里玩。老师们工作非常辛苦，每天都要待到很晚。利用这一点，要求你最喜欢的老师让你在那里做一些游戏。这里的风险是，如果你的老师足够酷，让你在他们的教室里运行RPG游戏，他们可能想加入进来。",
	"Gaming materials are a huge expense of playing these games, but they shouldn't have to be. Maybe my most controversial gaming opinion is that miniatures, maps, and dice aren't worth the effort. I appreciate the beautiful sculpts, the time-intensive and detailed painting, and the power of a 1/60th scale fantasy realm.": "游戏材料是玩这些游戏的一项巨大开支，但它们不应该是这样。也许我最有争议的游戏观点是，微型模型、地图和骰子不值得花钱。我欣赏精美的雕刻，耗时而细致的绘画，以及1/60比例的幻想境界的力量。",
	"Sadly, my apartment is too small to properly store a fantasy realm. I've resorted to using different-colored dice to differentiate characters. It's terribly clunky, yet effective. The best part of these games is Theater of the Mind, not exact recreations of every environment the game's characters will inhabit. Players have to use their imaginations and follow your lead as they inhabit these fantasy worlds. Simple drawings and describing the area in detail are all that's needed, really. For an effective, thrifty game master, less is always more. The newest miniature is only going to be impressive for so long. Players will remember the stories you all told together, rather than how cheap and boring your set-up was. Focus on gameplay over geography. You will be forgiven—even rewarded—for playing to your strengths. Your value as a Game Master is almost entirely contingent on your imagination and your friendships with the players.": "遗憾的是，我的公寓太小了，无法适当地储存一个幻想的境界。我只好用不同颜色的骰子来区分人物。这是很笨重的，但却很有效。这些游戏最好的部分是心灵剧场，而不是游戏人物将居住的每个环境的精确再现。玩家必须发挥他们的想象力，在他们居住在这些幻想的世界中时跟随你的领导。简单的图画和对该地区的详细描述就是所需的一切，真的。对于一个有效的、节俭的游戏主人来说，少即是多。最新的微缩模型只能让人印象深刻这么久。玩家会记得你们一起讲的故事，而不是你的布置有多么廉价和无聊。注重游戏性而不是地理性。你会被原谅，甚至会因为发挥你的长处而得到奖励。你作为一个游戏大师的价值几乎完全取决于你的想象力和你与玩家的友谊。",
	"That is why I rely on the most important weapon in a Game Master's arsenal: paper! There's nothing hundreds of dollars in miniatures and maps can do that a few scraps of paper can't. At the beginning of a campaign, make your players draw small drawings of their characters. (Then when they complain about not being able to draw, have them beg the most talented artist in your group to do it.) The uses for notecards and sticky notes alone are infinite. Make a lazy jigsaw puzzle to reveal an important clue or give players sticky notes to represent an important item. They will stick those little slips of paper onto their character sheet with pride. It's much more tactile and fun than simply adding another line of text to an equipment list.": "这就是为什么我依靠一个游戏大师的武器库中最重要的武器：纸！这就是为什么我依靠一个游戏大师的武器库。没有什么东西是几百美元的微缩模型和地图做不到的，几张废纸就可以做到。在战役开始时，让你的玩家为他们的角色画小图。(然后当他们抱怨不会画画时，让他们去求你们小组中最有天赋的艺术家来画。） 仅仅是记事卡和便条的用途就有无穷无尽。做一个懒惰的拼图来揭示一个重要的线索，或者给玩家粘纸来代表一个重要的物品。他们会很自豪地把这些小纸条贴在他们的角色表上。这比简单地在装备清单上再加一行文字要更有触觉和乐趣。",
	"You can make folded, simple paper standees that work just as well as pewter. It also helps Game Masters who prefer to improvise: There's no prep required. However, if you're going to draw every character and environment as your players encounter it, make sure you're quick about it. This builds into a hand-tailored style of running the game that helps players take ownership of your story. Campaign after campaign, adventure by adventure, I've been able to draw a full war-chest of settings, characters, monsters—even props. The best part is that they all fit in a single folder and aren't low-key embarrassing to carry around on the bus.": "你可以制作折叠的、简单的纸质斯坦德，其效果与锡制的一样好。这也有助于那些喜欢即兴创作的游戏大师。不需要做任何准备。然而，如果你要在玩家遇到每个角色和环境时都画出来，请确保你能快速完成。这就形成了一种手工定制的游戏运行方式，有助于玩家对你的故事拥有所有权。一场又一场的战役，一次又一次的冒险，我已经能够画出一个完整的设置、人物、怪物甚至是道具的战车。最重要的是，它们都装在一个文件夹里，而且在公交车上携带也不低调尴尬。",
	"If your group prefers something more literal for its gaming tools, a sheet of cheap, clear vinyl over grid paper is excellent and very affordable. You can get that pretty cheaply from a craft store. It's very quick to set up a scene like this for your players, and it's easy to clean up. Just keep in mind that dry erase markers run out of ink fast if you're changing locations and maps often. There's also a lot to be said for raiding an old game closet or garage sale for makeshift gaming materials. A checkers board is perfectly functional as a grid square, and there are no shortages of d6s in the world. The other, more bizarre dice are a different story, however.": "如果你的小组喜欢用一些更直白的东西来做游戏工具，一张廉价的透明乙烯基网格纸是非常好的，而且非常实惠。你可以从工艺品商店买到很便宜的东西。为你的玩家布置这样的场景非常快，而且很容易清理。只要记住，如果你经常更换地点和地图，干擦笔的墨水用得很快。搜集旧游戏柜或车库出售的临时游戏材料也是很有必要的。跳棋盘完全可以作为一个方格，而且世界上也不缺乏D6。然而，其他更奇怪的骰子则是另一回事。",
	"Fortunately, cell phones have made physical characters sheets and even dice obsolete in a lot of ways. While I prefer the sound of my tabletop getting cut up by dice, random number generators or free gaming-randomizer apps also work. And don't worry about players modifying the outcome of their rolls by using their tech savvy. Some players are going to fudge the numbers regardless of whether they are using a phone or actual dice. Just accept it. Digital character sheets are a good tool for newer players and very functional. I'm old-fashioned, so at my table I prefer paper because it's easier to keep track of a player's progress. Even though digital solutions may save you some money, be careful. You should try to keep your players' attention away from their devices as much as humanly possible. Once you lose that battle, you'll never get that turf back.": "幸运的是，手机在很多方面已经让实体角色表甚至是骰子变得过时了。虽然我更喜欢我的桌面被骰子切开的声音，但随机数生成器或免费的游戏随机器应用程序也可以。而且不要担心玩家会利用他们的技术知识修改他们的掷骰子结果。有些玩家会篡改数字，不管他们使用的是手机还是真的骰子。只要接受它。数字角色表对新玩家来说是个好工具，而且非常实用。我是个老古董，所以在我的桌子上我更喜欢纸质的，因为它更容易跟踪玩家的进展。尽管数字解决方案可能会为你节省一些钱，但要小心。你应该尽可能地让玩家的注意力远离他们的设备。一旦你输掉了这场战斗，你就再也无法拿回那块地盘了。",
	"One of the greatest unplanned costs of hosting a game night is food. Even if your friends pool their money to pay for take-out, it gets pricey if you are running a regular weekly session. A group of six players can blow through a bag of chips in under a minute, so you often have to buy snacks in bulk. If your friends like to drink while they play (mine sure as hell do), it's even worse. Many of us were raised to be generous hosts, perhaps to a fault. There's no shame in asking the players to turn each session into a potluck! Or, if you're uncomfortable asking people to chip in, schedule the session after lunch or after dinner so that there's no expectation to raid your pantry.": "举办游戏之夜的最大的计划外成本之一是食物。即使你的朋友们凑钱买外卖，但如果你每周定期举办一次，价格也会很高。一组六名玩家可以在一分钟内吃完一袋薯片，所以你经常不得不大量购买零食。如果你的朋友喜欢边玩边喝酒（我的朋友肯定是这样），那就更糟糕了。我们中的许多人被培养成慷慨的主人，也许是一种错误。要求玩家们把每节课都变成聚餐，这并不丢人！如果你觉得不舒服，你也可以要求玩家们参加聚餐。或者，如果你不愿意让大家凑钱，那就把会议安排在午餐后或晚餐后，这样就不会有人期望搜刮你的储藏室。",
	"All of this advice is just to let you know that, hey, money is in no way required to enjoy tabletop gaming. These things are designed to be flexible. Running an entire campaign might not fit in with your work schedule, and that's fine. The best, most innovative role-playing games are available for free online. And many of them are designed as one-offs. There are no rules as to how often you have to play. Yes, there are hardcore gamers who play multihour sessions every single day, but the rest of us have to work. Especially as you get older, a regular session might not be an option, given the time required. No matter how often you play, or with what kind of gaming supplies, maximize the fun.": "所有这些建议只是为了让你知道，嘿，享受桌面游戏绝非需要钱。这些东西的设计是很灵活的。运行整个活动可能不适合你的工作日程，这很好。最好的、最有创意的角色扮演游戏都可以在网上免费获得。而且其中许多游戏被设计成一次性的。没有规定你必须多长时间玩一次。是的，有一些铁杆玩家每天都要玩好几个小时，但我们其他人都要工作。特别是随着你年龄的增长，考虑到所需的时间，定期的会议可能不是一个选项。不管你多长时间玩一次，或者用什么样的游戏用品，都要把乐趣最大化。",
	"Work within your own means. Your players will know if you're stressing out over something, and that ultimately hurts the game. This is a hobby like everything else, so don't go overboard in trying to mimic the lavish set-ups you see online. Their tables may be more elaborate, but in no way does that make them better. Your friends won't judge you for the elder ice dragon you made from paper-towel rolls and duct tape. In fact, they'll love you for it.": "在你自己的能力范围内工作。你的玩家会知道你是否为某些事情感到紧张，而这最终会损害游戏。这和其他事情一样是一种爱好，所以不要过分地试图模仿你在网上看到的豪华布置。他们的桌子可能更精致，但这并不意味着他们更好。你的朋友不会因为你用纸巾卷和胶布做的冰龙老人而对你进行评判。事实上，他们会因此而喜欢你。",

	"Crystal Frasier": "克里斯蒂-弗拉西尔",
	"For all the dragons and spells, the worlds of roleplaying games are strikingly familiar. Gravity pulls things down. Adults grow from children. Fire is hot. These rules mean we can make sense of the fantastic worlds by looking at what's different: mischievous fairies, magic swords, vast underground megastructures. But even these fantastic traits carry a sort of mechanical logic and familiarity. A {@spell fireball} spell may never exist in the real world, but your wizard always knows when they expend that 3rd-level spell slot, they get a 20-foot radius cyclone of fiery death. But those fantastic elements—the altered laws of physics, the in-world legends, the bizarre—are what catch our attention and draw us in.": "对于所有的龙和法术，角色扮演游戏的世界是惊人的熟悉。重力把东西拉下来。成年人从儿童成长。火是热的。这些规则意味着我们可以通过观察不同的东西来理解梦幻般的世界：调皮的仙女、魔剑、巨大的地下巨型建筑。但即使是这些梦幻般的特征也带有某种机械的逻辑性和熟悉性。一个{@spell fireball}的法术可能在现实世界中从未存在过，但你的巫师总是知道当他们消耗那个3级法术槽时，他们会得到一个半径为20英尺的火热死亡旋风。但是那些奇妙的元素--改变的物理定律、世界上的传说、离奇的事情--是吸引我们的注意力，并把我们吸引进去。",
	"The bizarre is unexpected, strange, or even a funny way the game world differs from what we expect. Small bits of the bizarre—magic, monsters, or spaceships—all help a setting stand out from our everyday world. But they are almost mundane to anyone who has spent a lifetime watching TV, reading books, and listening to fiction podcasts. Bizarre is where your world breaks its own rules for what is and isn't normal, and when used thoughtfully, it can reignite a sense of wonder.": "诡异是指游戏世界与我们所期望的不同，是意外的、奇怪的，甚至是有趣的方式。小小的怪异--魔法、怪兽或飞船--都能帮助一个环境从我们的日常世界中脱颖而出。但对于那些一生都在看电视、看书、听小说播客的人来说，它们几乎都是平凡的。怪异是你的世界打破了它自己的规则，什么是正常的，什么是不正常的，如果深思熟虑地使用，它可以重新唤起人们的好奇心。",
	"Adding elements of the bizarre to your game can be a fun way to flesh out the world, build myths or urban legends, or take a momentary break from the normal tone of your campaign. Because the bizarre is often a matter of description rather than major rules changes, it's rarely even that hard once you learn a few key lessons. Many players love a game where the bizarre takes center stage for an adventure, or for the whole campaign, but knowing how to write it means understanding what makes something bizarre and when to use it.": "在你的游戏中加入怪异的元素可以成为一种有趣的方式来充实世界，建立神话或城市传说，或者从你的活动的正常基调中获得短暂的休息。因为怪异往往是一个描述的问题，而不是主要的规则变化，一旦你学会了一些关键的经验，它甚至很少那么难。许多玩家都喜欢这样的游戏，即在一次冒险中，或在整个战役中，怪异成为中心舞台，但知道如何写怪异意味着了解什么是怪异以及何时使用它。",
	"Bizarre doesn't mean chaos and randomness. Change for the sake of change is wackiness, and it can be fun—especially if you plan an adventure in a plane of chaos—but humans are pattern-seeking creatures and like to know some reason lurks behind the unreasonable. Writing the bizarre means change, but with rules. Those rules can be obscure or counterintuitive, but you need at least some cursory guidelines. There needs to be some order, or reason, or internal logic, if only so the players know things are going badly when you break the rules later.": "怪异并不意味着混乱和随机。为改变而改变是古怪的，它可以很有趣--特别是如果你在混乱的平面上计划一次冒险，但人类是寻求模式的动物，喜欢知道在不合理的背后潜藏着一些原因。写作怪异意味着变化，但要有规则。这些规则可以是晦涩难懂的，也可以是反直觉的，但你至少需要一些粗略的准则。需要有一些秩序，或理由，或内部逻辑，哪怕只是为了让玩家知道当你以后打破规则时事情会变得很糟糕。",
	"One of the best ways for showcasing the bizarre elements of your world is through contrast. One dot of color stands out brilliantly against a muted background, and likewise a lone strange element in an otherwise familiar situation—especially if no one else seems to notice it—seems far more unsettling and important than a firehose of random changes and oblique references. Likewise, adding some element of the mundane to a magical or supernatural element draws more attention to the rest of the strangeness. Maybe goblins in one adventure—a very familiar monster—have enormous secondary mouths in their stomachs, which speak an alien language and seem far smarter than the goblins themselves. Why? That's for you to figure out, but even if you never explain it, it adds an unsettling twist to something familiar to your players. In the other direction, taking your players to a psychedelic dimension of dreams might be fun, but adding an NPC who dresses and acts like a bored retail worker grounds the experience in something familiar, and makes both the dream world and the NPC seem weirder by the contrast. Consider what the rules are in your setting, follow them to their extremes, and then figure out a way to make your players interact with these unusual edge cases. Consider the {@spell fireball} spell: hold out a pinch of bat guano to create a ball of intense heat. Where does that heat come from? Does the spell open a momentary portal to an elemental plane? Could strange things try to slip out every time a {@spell fireball} spell is cast? What if there's a powerful, ancient fire elemental or genie that created the {@spell fireball} spell and gave it to humans as a means of escaping one tiny piece at a time? Or consider the bat guano—where does it go? And why guano? Is there a demiplane somewhere that collects the material components from spells as a sort of cosmic tax on magic? And if so, does that mean there are demiplanes filled with more valuable components, like the onyx from {@spell create undead} spells?": "展示你的世界中的怪异元素的最好方法之一是通过对比。一个颜色的点在柔和的背景下显得非常突出，同样，在一个熟悉的环境中，一个孤独的奇怪的元素--特别是如果没有其他人似乎注意到它--看起来比随机的变化和模糊的参考文献更令人不安和重要。同样，在魔法或超自然的元素中加入一些世俗的元素，会使人们更加注意其余的奇怪之处。也许在一次冒险中的地精--一种非常熟悉的怪物--在它们的肚子里有巨大的副嘴，它们会说一种外星语言，而且似乎比地精本身聪明得多。为什么呢？这就需要你去弄清楚，但即使你不解释，它也会给你的玩家所熟悉的东西增加一个令人不安的转折。在另一个方向，把你的玩家带到一个迷幻的梦境中可能会很有趣，但是加入一个穿着和行为都像一个无聊的零售工人的NPC，会使这种体验建立在熟悉的东西上，并使梦境和NPC在对比中显得更加怪异。考虑一下你的设定中的规则是什么，遵循它们的极致，然后想办法让你的玩家与这些不寻常的边缘案例互动。考虑一下{@spell fireball}的咒语：拿出一撮蝙蝠粪便，创造一个强烈的热球。这种热量从哪里来？这个咒语是否打开了一个通往元素界的瞬间门户？每次施展{@spell fireball}法术时，会不会有奇怪的东西试图溜出来？如果有一个强大的、古老的火元素或精灵创造了{@spell fireball}的咒语，并把它交给人类作为每次逃出一小块的手段呢？或者考虑一下蝙蝠的鸟粪--它去了哪里？而且为什么是鸟粪？是否在某个地方有一个半位面，收集法术中的物质成分，作为一种对魔法的宇宙税？如果是这样，这是否意味着有一些半位面充满了更有价值的成分，比如来自{@spell create undead}法术的玛瑙？",
	"Consider whatever strange element you want to bring into your game and what rules apply to it. How do the PCs interact with it? What happens when they question it or try to learn more? What happens when they start rolling dice? Don't keep the bizarre completely out of their hands—if you do, your game becomes a lecture—but make sure they know that mastering this bizarre element isn't as easy or straightforward as they may think.": "考虑你想把什么奇怪的元素带入你的游戏，以及对它适用什么规则。PC如何与之互动？当他们质疑它或试图了解更多情况时会发生什么？当他们开始掷骰子时会发生什么？不要让怪异的东西完全脱离他们的掌控--如果你这样做了，你的游戏就变成了说教--但要确保他们知道，掌握这个怪异的元素并不像他们想象的那样简单或直接。",
	"Suspension of disbelief is the willingness for your players to accept things they know are impossible. If a cartoon rabbit falls off a cliff and then gets up and walks away, we accept that because those are the rules for cartoons. If a gritty detective in a serious movie does the same, we don't accept it, because gritty detectives don't use the same rules as cartoon rabbits. But then you have Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a gritty detective movie that also applies cartoon logic, showing us that there are fuzzy edges to any audience's suspension of disbelief, and those fuzzy edges are where you can play.": "悬念是指你的玩家愿意接受他们知道不可能的事情。如果一只卡通兔子从悬崖上摔下来，然后爬起来走了，我们接受，因为这是卡通片的规则。如果一个严肃的电影中的狡猾的侦探做了同样的事情，我们不接受，因为狡猾的侦探不使用与卡通兔子一样的规则。但是，你有《谁陷害了兔子罗杰》，这部狡猾的侦探电影也应用了卡通逻辑，向我们展示了任何观众的悬念都有模糊的边缘，而这些模糊的边缘就是你可以发挥的地方。",
	"Think about what strange elements your players already accept in the game: magical creatures, spells that create ice, spirits of the dead lingering to haunt the living, other dimensions. These are the parts of your story where your players already suspend their disbelief and are more willing to accept the bizarre. If you want an NPC who only speaks in rhyme, then use a creature they have already accepted as magical. If you want a palace of ice in the middle of the desert, connect it to spells they already accept. If you want an adventure that defies all the normal rules, put it in another dimension where they already expect the rules to change.": "想想你的玩家在游戏中已经接受了哪些奇怪的元素：神奇的生物、创造冰的法术、萦绕在活人身上的亡灵、其他空间。在你的故事中，这些部分是你的玩家已经暂停了他们的怀疑，并且更愿意接受奇怪的东西。如果你想要一个只会说韵文的NPC，那么就用一个他们已经接受的有魔法的生物。如果你想在沙漠中建造一座冰宫，就把它与他们已经接受的法术联系起来。如果你想要一个违背所有正常规则的冒险，那就把它放在另一个他们已经预期规则会改变的空间。",
	"If you don't want to introduce your bizarre elements in connection to those areas where the PCs have already suspended their disbelief, you can mimic the process many science fiction or supernatural television shows use to introduce their fantastic element. The introduce the element slowly over many episodes, letting audiences adjust their suspension of disbelief a little at a time. Lead your own players away from normal one step at a time. Start with a simple change from the status quo, such as rumors of a new monster, fantastic locations, or a minor magic effect they can't identify or reproduce. You can end up in strange new places like cities of living memories built sideways through time!": "如果你不想在那些NPC已经暂停怀疑的地方引入你的奇异元素，你可以模仿许多科幻或超自然的电视节目用来引入他们的奇异元素的过程。他们在很多集里慢慢地引入元素，让观众每次都能调整他们的悬念。引导你自己的玩家一步步脱离正常状态。从一个简单的改变现状开始，比如一个新怪物的传闻，奇妙的地点，或者一个他们无法识别或复制的小魔法效果。你可以在奇怪的新地方结束，比如通过时间横向建立的活生生的记忆之城!",
	"Every group will accept different levels of the bizarre, so it's important to pay attention to your players and see what strange elements catch their attention or get them excited. It's even more important to notice what elements make them check out or start cracking jokes. Like many story elements, bizarre elements feel more welcome and believable if you drop hints to your group early on. Use NPCs and world lore to spell out not only the rules of your world, but also to foreshadow the creepy times when those rules are broken. If you want an adventure in an Escher-esque world, start a few sessions earlier with a bard spinning campfire tale of a cursed artist who sought literal immortality through their works. If your players find the story interesting, you can feed them a bit more; perhaps the mayor's ancestors vanished mysteriously when they crossed a traveling artist. These small tastes prime the pump for your players' expectations and let you gauge how interested they seem to be.": "每个小组都会接受不同程度的怪异，所以关注你的玩家，看看哪些奇怪的元素能吸引他们的注意力或让他们兴奋，这很重要。更重要的是，要注意哪些元素会让他们退缩或开始开笑话。就像许多故事元素一样，如果你在早期就给你的小组留下暗示，奇怪的元素就会感到更受欢迎和可信。利用NPC和世界传说，不仅要说明你的世界的规则，而且要预示这些规则被打破时的惊悚时刻。如果你想在一个埃舍尔式的世界中进行冒险，可以在几节课前让一个吟游诗人讲述一个被诅咒的艺术家的篝火故事，这个艺术家通过他们的作品寻求真正的不朽。如果你的玩家觉得这个故事很有趣，你可以给他们提供更多的内容；也许市长的祖先在遇到一个旅行艺术家时神秘地消失了。这些小故事能激发玩家的期望，让你衡量他们的兴趣。",
	"Adding elements of the bizarre to your game can be a fun way to flesh out the world, build myths or urban legends, or take a momentary break from the normal tone of your campaign.": "在你的游戏中加入怪异的元素，可以成为充实世界、建立神话或城市传说的有趣方式，或者从你的活动的正常基调中获得短暂的休息。",
	"Here are a few ideas for you to try.": "这里有几个想法供你尝试。",
	"Popular imagery is full of ideas of what the afterlife is, amounting to a grand courtroom where the dead defend their lives. There's also the idea of gambling with death to return to life. If we combine these two ideas, we could see death as a casino, where every major deed in life translates to a chip that can be used in different games depending on the nature of the deed. The dead must win at least one game to move on, or slowly decay into dust, but if they can double their stake they can return to the living. In this scenario, a {@spell resurrection} spell wouldn't bring a dead adventurer back, but instead let the living join them in the casino and play on their behalf—the diamond spell component serving as their ante. This changes resurrecting a fallen friend into its own adventure, and depending on your players, that might be a high-stakes gambling story or a heist. ": "流行的意象充满了来世是什么的想法，相当于一个大法庭，死者在那里捍卫自己的生命。还有一种想法是与死亡赌博，以恢复生命。如果我们把这两个想法结合起来，我们可以把死亡看作是一个赌场，生命中的每一个重大行为都会转化为一个筹码，可以根据行为的性质在不同的游戏中使用。死者必须至少赢得一场游戏才能继续前进，否则就会慢慢腐烂成灰，但如果他们能将赌注翻倍，就能回到生者身边。在这种情况下，{@spell resurrection}的法术不会让死去的冒险家复活，而是让活人加入他们的赌场，并代表他们进行游戏--钻石法术成分作为他们的赌注。这就把复活一个死去的朋友变成了自己的冒险，而根据你的玩家，这可能是一个高风险的赌博故事或抢劫。",
	"In fairy tales, fey, goblins, and witches sometimes trade favors for a person's dearest memories. But what do they do with those memories, and what happens if adventurers need one of those memories to solve a mystery? What if fey and devils have their own otherworldly commodities market where they buy and sell memories like a modern-day stock market, with backroom deals, supply-and-demand, and speculation of which memories will be readily available in the future versus which are rare? Adventurers seeking one memory from the thousands traded every day may drive the price up, requiring them to run a con game to make the memory they need seem worthless. Or they'll have to strike a bizarre deal that requires them to forge very specific memories they agree to trade to a broker—if they can find one they trust. ": "在童话故事中，精灵、妖精和女巫有时会用人情来换取一个人最珍贵的记忆。但他们如何处理这些记忆呢？如果冒险者需要这些记忆来解开一个谜团，会发生什么？如果精灵和魔鬼有他们自己的异世界商品市场，在那里他们像现代的股票市场一样买卖记忆，有密室交易、供求关系，以及对哪些记忆在未来会很容易得到而哪些则很罕见的猜测，那会怎么样呢？冒险家们从每天交易的数千条记忆中寻找一条，可能会推动价格上涨，需要他们玩一个骗局，使他们需要的记忆看起来一文不值。或者他们将不得不达成一个奇怪的交易，要求他们伪造非常具体的记忆，他们同意交易给经纪人--如果他们能找到他们信任的人的话。",
	"A spell that removes a character from the game after one bad roll frustrates even veteran players, as your night of fun with friends has turned into a night of watching your friends have fun. You may want to turn failed saving throws for these \"save or die\" effects into their own small encounters. The {@spell maze} spell tosses its target into an extradimensional maze for up to 10 minutes and requires an Intelligence test to escape—easy enough for a studied wizard, but frustrating for an action-hero fighter. If the maze is instead inside the spellcaster's mind, then the trapped fighter might run into different, hostile aspects of the wizard's psyche, either battling or roleplaying with them to distract the spellcaster or impose penalties back in the real world. In this scenario, the trapped player still contributes to the adventure, even if they can't win the day single-handedly, and the spell's challenge doesn't feel so hopeless! You can apply this idea to other effects where a failed save leaves a PC incapacitated for minutes or hours. Perhaps a medusa's petrifying gaze launches a character's soul into the Elemental Plane of Earth where they can try to beat elementals at riddle games. Or a sea hag's death glare traps a target's soul inside the raging storm of her own soul alongside however many souls she's claimed before.

	"Since 1977, many a player has faced the icy breath and gnashing jaws of the {@creature winter wolf}. This white, adventurer-eating critter has made (as far as I know) an appearance in every edition of the world's most popular RPG since its creation. In its current incarnation for 5th edition, this large-sized monstrosity comes in at a respectable Challenge 3 (700 XP). I mean, that's pretty realistic for 8 feet long, 4 feet at the shoulder, with an average of 75 hit points and the ability to breathe a 1 5-foot cone of 4d8 cold damage. Add in that it understands both Common and Giant, has Pack Tactics, and is kind of sneaky (Stealth +3, with advantage in snowy terrain), and your PCs have a rough foe to deal with. Think if it is not one, but a pack of 6-10 of these nasty critters coming at your favorite second tier (levels 5-10) party of adventurers—now that's a challenge.": "自1977年以来，许多玩家都面对过{@creature winter wolf}的冰冷气息和咬牙切齿的大嘴。这个白色的、吃冒险家的小动物（据我所知）自创建以来，在世界最流行的RPG游戏的每个版本中都出现过。在目前的第五版中，这种大型怪物的挑战值为3（700XP），令人尊敬。我的意思是，对于8英尺长，肩部4英尺，平均75点命中率，并能吸入15英尺锥形的4D8冷伤害来说，这已经很现实了。再加上它既懂普通话又懂巨人，有群体战术，而且有点鬼鬼祟祟（隐身术+3，在雪地上有优势），你的NPC就有一个艰难的敌人要对付了。想想看，如果不是一只，而是一群6-10只这样讨厌的小动物向你最喜欢的第二层（5-10级）冒险者队伍袭来，那就是一个挑战。",
	"Winter wolves are a super versatile monster that work great for first tier (levels 1-4) and even third tier (levels I I-1 6) play, as well. At low levels, a lone winter wolf can make for a nasty mini-boss fight or an even worse random encounter. At higher levels, the winter wolf becomes the servant, fodder, or ally monster for more powerful foes. Winter wolves serve the role of hunting hounds and guard dogs for frost giants. They make powerful minions for an evil wizard or sorceress. They also make great side quest encounters for single PCs of third tier levels.": "冬狼是一种超级通用的怪物，对于第一层（1-4级），甚至第三层（I-1-6级）的游戏也很适用。在低级别的情况下，一只孤独的冬狼可以成为一个讨厌的小BOSS战斗或更糟糕的随机遭遇。在更高的级别，冬狼会成为更强大的敌人的仆人、炮灰或盟友怪物。冬狼的作用是猎犬和冰霜巨人的警卫犬。它们是邪恶巫师或女巫的强大爪牙。它们也是第三层级的单人NPC的绝佳副线任务遭遇。",
	"If you need inspiration, look no further than the movie The Grey, starring Liam Neeson. Switch out the wolves for winter wolves and switch out the oil pipeline for a trade route and send the PCs hunting. You pretty much can mirror most of the scenes in the movie and have a nasty adventure (just change the plane crash to a wagon crash). So, watch the movie and consider it enjoyable GM homework for using wolves, worgs, and winter wolves on their own as foes for your PCs.": "如果你需要灵感，可以看看连姆-尼森主演的电影《灰色》。把狼换成冬狼，把石油管道换成贸易路线，然后派人去打猎。你几乎可以照搬电影中的大部分场景，并有一个讨厌的冒险（只是把飞机坠毁改为马车坠毁）。所以，看完这部电影，并把它当作愉快的GM作业，用狼、虫子和冬狼来作为你的NPC的敌人。",
	"Let us get to tweaking for winter wolves. As I stated earlier, the 5e, Challenge 3 version is pretty good to go as is. But we can do some simple things to surprise your well-read or experienced players. The simplest is to add an Alpha wolf (or two, if you are feeling really nasty), if you are using a pack of winter wolves.": "让我们开始为冬狼进行调整。正如我前面所说，5e，挑战3的版本是相当不错的，可以按原样进行。但我们可以做一些简单的事情，让你的熟人或有经验的玩家感到惊讶。最简单的是增加一只阿尔法狼（或两只，如果你觉得很讨厌的话），如果你使用的是一群冬狼。",
	"An Alpha is just a cut above the average winter wolf. To make something an Alpha on the fly, just give it max hit points instead of average, and give it +2 AC and +2 bonus on all d20 rolls. If you have time to throw a new stat block together, you just need a few stat bumps. First off, a bump up in natural armor (l mean, being the pack alpha is a tough job). Next, give your Alpha a Hit Dice and challenge increase. You can also add in a new ability, plus up the damage and recharge of the Alpha's attacks. If you do all that, you get the stat block below, as an example.": "阿尔法只是比普通的冬狼高一等。要使某样东西成为阿尔法，只需给它最大的命中率而不是平均命中率，并给它+2 AC和在所有D20卷上的+2奖励。如果你有时间把一个新的属性块放在一起，你只需要一些属性的提升。首先，提高自然护甲（我的意思是，作为狼群的首领是一个艰难的工作）。接下来，给你的阿尔法增加一个命中率和挑战值。你还可以增加一个新的能力，再加上提高阿尔法攻击的伤害和充能。如果你做了所有这些，你就会得到下面的状态块，作为一个例子。",
	"Let's try another tweak. If you are looking to use a lone winter wolf for, say, a random encounter for second tier PCs or as a solo monster for first tier PCs, then you might go with a winter wolf that is the lone survivor or has been shunned or outcast by their pack. Maybe the outcast lost a battle for pack leadership? In nature, when such occurs, most animals either die, join a new pack, or form their own new pack. The rare few that don't and still manage to eke out survival become quite fierce and savage. Such a winter wolf would make a great side quest for a second tier PC or party, or a whole adventure for a first tier party.": "让我们尝试另一种调整。如果你想使用一只孤独的冬狼，比如说，为第二层的NPC提供一个随机的遭遇，或者为第一层的NPC提供一个单独的怪物，那么你可以使用一只冬狼，它是孤独的幸存者，或者已经被他们的族群回避或抛弃了。也许这个被抛弃的人在争夺狼群领导权的战斗中失败了？在自然界中，当这种情况发生时，大多数动物要么死亡，要么加入一个新的狼群，要么形成自己的新狼群。少数没有这样做的动物，仍然设法勉强生存，变得相当凶猛和野蛮。这样的冬狼将成为第二级PC或政党的一个伟大的副业，或第一级政党的整个冒险。",
	"Think about this: What seems to be a pack of massive wolves has been slaughtering any travelers who dare to try and traverse the foothills and low trade trails of a mountain range during winter. The wolves only slaughter livestock and draft animals, but never eat them. They also leave no trace of any humanoids. The PCs are brought in to find and slay these menaces. Now the PCs get to try and figure this very un-wolf-like behavior out and track down what happened to the missing humanoids. When they track down the wolf den, they find the place carpeted with humanoid bones. They also discover there is only one very nasty, scarred, and feral winter wolf!": "考虑一下这个问题。似乎是一群巨大的狼一直在屠杀任何敢于尝试在冬季穿越山脉的山脚和低级贸易小径的旅行者。狼群只屠杀牲畜和草食动物，但从来不吃它们。他们也没有留下任何人类的痕迹。NPC被带到这里来寻找并杀死这些威胁者。现在，NPC要试图弄清这种非常不像狼的行为，并追踪失踪的人类发生了什么。当他们追踪到狼穴时，他们发现那里铺满了人形生物的骨头。他们还发现，这里只有一只非常讨厌的、有疤痕的、野性的冬狼！这只冬狼是谁？",
	"For this tweak we can just take the Alpha and make a few easy changes. Take away anything to do with a pack, give it some solo abilities, and if you are feeling frisky, make it a Legendary Monster with some Legendary and Lair actions. That is the easiest way to make a single foe feel like multiple foes, and most players hate it when a monster does actions on PCs' turns.": "在这次调整中，我们可以只对阿尔法进行一些简单的修改。去掉任何与族群有关的东西，给它一些单独的能力，如果你觉得很刺激，就把它变成一个有一些传奇和巢穴行动的传奇怪物。这是让一个敌人感觉像多个敌人的最简单的方法，而且大多数玩家都讨厌怪物在NPC的回合中做动作。",
	"Now looking at this outcast, it is a very powerful combatant for Challenge 5, but this wolf is alone. This means all the PCs' attacks and abilities will be focused on it. The outcast does not have any great saving throws, and besides the cold breath, it is a melee fighter. Speed 50 ft.": "现在看看这个弃儿，它是挑战5的一个非常强大的战斗力，但这只狼是孤独的。这意味着NPC的所有攻击和能力都将集中在它身上。弃儿没有任何强大的蓄力，除了寒冷的气息，它是一个近战战士。速度50英尺。",
	"So beating it only takes trapping it or keeping it at range. The Army of One ability makes that tough, but Mental-based spell saves will end the outcast. Also, all damage except Cold Damage works on it. One ranger with a long bow and one of the nastier ranged weapon feats will whittle away at the outcast's Hit Points in only a few rounds. If that ranger has at least three buddies, then the fight will be fun and interesting, but likely not go any way in the outcast's favor.": "所以打败它只需要困住它或把它保持在一定范围内。一体化军队的能力使之变得艰难，但基于精神的法术救赎将结束弃儿。另外，除了冷伤害外，所有的伤害都对它有效。一个拥有长弓的游侠和一个更恶心的远程武器功绩的人可以在几个回合内削去弃儿的生命值。如果那个游侠至少有三个伙伴，那么这场战斗就会很有趣，但很可能不会对弃儿有利。",
	"This is what you want when tweaking a monster. Make it a surprise to your players. Let the tweaks make the combat or encounter interesting. Last, but not least, make the monster beatable. In the end you want the PCs to win. You just want to rough them up and worry them while they do.": "这就是你在调整一个怪物时想要的东西。让它成为玩家的惊喜。让这些调整使战斗或遭遇变得有趣。最后，但并非最不重要的是，使怪物可以被击败。最后，你希望NPC能够获胜。你只是想在他们赢的时候，让他们受到伤害，让他们担心。",
	"A purple-hued flask that sparks of tiny lightning can be seen dancing within. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the lightning bottle as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d6} lightning damage, and if the target takes damage from this attack, it cannot take a reaction until your next turn.": "一个紫色的烧瓶，可以看到里面有微小的闪电火花在跳舞。作为一个动作，你可以把这个瓶子扔到20英尺远的地方，在撞击时把它摔碎。对一个生物或物体进行一次远程攻击，将闪电瓶视为一种简易武器。一旦命中，目标会受到{@damage 2d6}的闪电伤害，如果目标受到这次攻击的伤害，在你下一个回合之前，它不能做出反应。",
	"When you drink this potion, you gain the effects of the {@spell jump} spell.

The fan recharges 24 hours after it's used to open or close a portal.": "这把杰出的扇子由黑色和白色的羽毛交替制成，安装在一个长长的金色手柄上，末端呈钥匙形状。每天一次，它可以打开空气界和物质界之间已经存在的门户。这把扇子也可以关闭传送门。如果传送门没有因为使用风扇而关闭，它将在两小时后自动关闭。这个物品不会创造传送门；它只是打开那些已经存在的传送门。风扇在用于打开或关闭传送门后24小时内会重新充电。",
	"The carafe sloshes when shaken, as if it contains liquid. The carafe weighs 1 pound.

The chocolate stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options: Tall (12 oz.), Grande (16 oz.), Venti (20 oz.).": "摇晃时，瓶身会滑动，仿佛里面有液体。杯子有1磅重。你可以用一个动作来打开盖子，并说出三个命令词中的一个，这样就会有一定量的热巧克力或冷巧克力牛奶（你选择）从瓶中涌出。巧克力在你下一个回合开始时停止倾泻。从以下选项中选择。高杯（12盎司），大杯（16盎司），凡提（20盎司）。",
