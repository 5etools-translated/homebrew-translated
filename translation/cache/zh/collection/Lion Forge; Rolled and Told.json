	"This adventure is designed for a group of four or five 2nd-3rd level characters, though it is easily modifiable for 4th-5th level PCs by making all the goblin whelps regular goblins and adding +2 to the skill challenge DCs. To enjoy with even higher level PCs, turn all the whelps to goblins, maximize the HP of all the other foes, and increase the DC of all tests by +5 (to a max {@dc 20}).

	"What happens when a tribe of goblins stumbles upon a downed gnomish airship? Nothing good, especially since they can't land it and can hardly control it. The PCs are called upon by a gnomish clan to try not only to stop the goblins, but also to save the ship and the gnomish prisoners the goblins have aboard it. To do so, the PCs will have to fly in a hot air balloon or some gnomish sprocket gliders (rudimentary magic-mechanical biplanes) and dog-fight goblins riding giant wasps to accomplish the task.": "当一个地精部落偶然发现了一艘坠落的地精飞艇时，会发生什么？没有什么好事，尤其是他们无法降落，也很难控制它。一个地精部落要求NPC不仅要试图阻止地精，还要拯救这艘船和地精在船上的囚犯。为此，NPC将不得不乘坐热气球或一些地精的链轮滑翔机（简陋的魔法机械双翼飞机），与骑着巨大黄蜂的地精进行狗斗来完成任务。",
	"The gnomes of Cogclatter are tinkerers, every one. All are famous (in some cases, infamous) for their inventions. Many of said inventions are no more than curiosities, trinkets, or are outright junk. Though a few are revolutionary, none compare to their massive cloud-schooner airship {@item The Soaring Jabberwock|RolledTold1} (a flying vehicle far larger than any other known airship). Still in the gnomish-try-it-prototype stage of development (meaning they are using it, even though it is untested and most likely will end in disastrous results), a band of gnomes took the ungainly airship for a long-range test flight.": "Cogclatter的地精们都是工匠，每一个都是。所有人都因他们的发明而闻名（在某些情况下，臭名昭著）。许多发明都不过是好奇心、小玩意，或者是彻头彻尾的垃圾。虽然有几个是革命性的，但没有一个能比得上他们巨大的云啸飞艇（%0%）（一种远比其他已知飞艇大的飞行器）。仍然处于地精的尝试--原型开发阶段（意味着他们正在使用它，尽管它未经测试，而且很可能以灾难性的结果告终），一队地精带着这艘笨重的飞艇进行了远程试飞。",
	"As with most things in the gnomish-try-it-prototype stage, things went badly. The airship began losing height as one of the four balloons that keep it aloft lost pressure at an alarming rate. Being quick-witted, the skeleton test crew managed to put the airship down safely and went about making repairs. Trying to solve the pressure problem, the gnomes opted for using giant floating fungus creatures. The floating fungus creatures, known as gas spores, are easily popped, so to fix that issue, a rather potent adhesive was mixed up. Coating the fungus spores in the protective adhesive would keep the gas spores from bursting when the gnomes herded them to the airship. The adhesive also aided in \"installing\" the glue-treated gas spores inside the original balloon of the vessel. Discovering that their intimal calculations were a few gas spores shy of the needed lift to fly the airship, the gnomes sent a small band to gather the necessary spores. This is where the Deathsting goblin tribe comes into the story. The goblins went to the gas spore caverns for sport at popping the spores without being killed. They found the gnomes as they were leaving with the needed spores. The goblins stealthily followed the gnomes back to the airship. A handful of the goblins stayed to keep watch as the rest went back to gather the rest of the tribe to attack the strange gnomes and their boat. The sizable goblin mob easily took the ship and captured the gnomes. However, as the tribe began looting the ship, one goblin mistakenly cut the airship loose with most of the tribe onboard.": "和大多数处于地精试制阶段的事情一样，事情进展得很糟糕。飞艇开始失去高度，因为使它保持在高空的四个气球中的一个以惊人的速度失去压力。聪明的骨干测试人员设法将飞艇安全放下，并开始进行修理。为了解决压力问题，地精们选择了使用巨大的浮动真菌生物。漂浮的真菌生物，被称为气体孢子，很容易被弹开，所以为了解决这个问题，混合了一种相当有力的粘合剂。将真菌孢子涂在保护性粘合剂中，可以使气体孢子在地精们将它们赶到飞艇上时不会爆裂。粘合剂还有助于将经过胶水处理的气体孢子 \"安装 \"在船只的原始气球内。发现他们的内部计算离飞艇所需的升力还差几个气体孢子，地精们派了一小队人马去收集必要的孢子。这就是死亡之星地精部落进入故事的地方。地精们去了气体孢子洞，在不被杀死的情况下进行爆裂孢子的运动。他们在地精带着所需的孢子离开时发现了他们。妖精们悄悄地跟着地精们回到了飞艇上。一小部分地精留下来看守，其余的人则回去召集其余的部落来攻击这些奇怪的地精和他们的船。规模庞大的地精暴徒很容易就占领了那艘船，并抓住了地精。然而，当部落开始掠夺这艘船时，一个地精错误地切断了飞艇的电源，船上的大部分部落成员都在其中。",
	"All this misfortune and mischief occurred two weeks ago, and the now-flying goblins have been marauding about the area, attacking, robbing, looting, or just destroying anything that ends up in their flightpath. Being unable to land has done nothing to deter the goblins from utilizing their flying prize. They drop objects-goblins, or, in some cases, livestock-onto targets below them as mobs of goblins slide down ropes or fly down on their giant wasp mounts to overwhelm any travelers, caravans, farmsteads, or small settlements encountered.": "所有这些不幸和恶作剧都发生在两周前，现在会飞的地精一直在这个地区游荡，攻击、抢劫、掠夺，或者只是破坏任何出现在他们飞行路线上的东西。无法着陆并没有阻止妖精们利用他们的飞行成果。他们把物体--妖精，或者在某些情况下，牲畜--扔到他们下面的目标上，妖精们从绳索上滑下来，或者骑着巨大的黄蜂坐骑飞下来，压倒任何旅行者、商队、农庄，或者遇到的小定居点。",
	"During the goblin sky-pirate chaos, the gnomes of Cogclatter have been hard at work on a plan to take back the airship, save the captive gnomes aboard, and spare the countryside from future goblin piracy. The plan they have come up with will require the help of adventurers to pull off and that is where the PCs come in.": "在地精天空海盗的混乱中，Cogclatter的地精们一直在努力制定一个计划，以夺回飞艇，拯救船上被俘的地精，并使乡村免于未来的地精海盗行为。他们想出的计划需要冒险者的帮助才能完成，而这正是NPC发挥作用的地方。",
	"\"The Super Heroic, Wildly Witty Jabberwock Aerial Siege Theory Almost Plan,\" as the gnomes call it, will require the PCs, along with a small group of gnomish engineers, to fly a hot air balloon and a handful of prototype magic-mechanical biplanes called Sprocket Gliders to the airship and take it back from the goblins, thus saving the airship, its crew, and the day. Simple, right?": "\"超级英雄、狂野诙谐的Jabberwock空中围攻理论几乎计划\"，正如地精所称，需要NPC和一小群地精工程师一起，驾驶热气球和少数被称为链轮滑翔机的魔法机械双翼飞机原型飞向飞艇，从地精手中夺回它，从而拯救飞艇、船员和这一天。很简单，对吗？",
	"The easiest way to start such a wild and nonsense-filled adventure is to start in the middle of the action as they are traveling along a road or overland. In this case... Just drop a cow on them! (See {@adventure The Sky is Falling|JollyGobbler|1|The Sky Is Falling}.)": "开始这样一场狂野的、充满胡言乱语的冒险的最简单方法是在他们沿着公路或陆路旅行时，从行动的中间开始。在这种情况下... 就把一头牛丢给他们吧!

	"You have heard rumors that the gnomes of Cogclatter are in the market for adventurers to deal with some sort of goblin problem. Being in need of coin and always seeking adventure, you hit the road en route to the gnomish city. The trek to the lake-bound trade city has thus far proved to be an easy one, since the floating settlement sits at a hub of waterways, well-maintained roadways, and trade routes. Even the weather seems to want to make your trek enjoyable as a warm sun washes down from a clear blue sky. Just as that thought settles in, a heavy shadow washes over you, and strangely, a panicked mooing seems to be coming closer rather quickly.": "你听说有传言说，科格克拉特的地精们正在寻找冒险者来处理某种地精问题。由于需要钱财，而且一直在寻求冒险，你在前往地精城市的路上上路了。到目前为止，前往湖边贸易城市的旅程被证明是很容易的，因为这个浮动定居点位于水路、维护良好的公路和贸易路线的中心。甚至天气似乎也想让你愉快地跋涉，因为温暖的阳光从晴朗的天空中照射下来。就在这一想法尘埃落定的时候，一个沉重的阴影笼罩着你，奇怪的是，一阵惊慌失措的哞叫声似乎很快就会传来。",

	"You stumble clear of piles of refuse and gore, trying to make sense of what had just transpired—somehow, scores of goblins just randomly assaulted you with a deluge of junk, garbage, and livestock. Even harder for your ringing heads to contemplate, the goblins had a flying schooner. Just as that strangeness sinks in, a roaring clamor of rumbling mechanical sounds and a steam whistle fills the air, quickly followed by a sight even stranger than goblins with an airship. Through a cloud of dust, smoke, and steam, four massive covered wagons—devoid of any draft animals—rumble past at breakneck speed, nearly bowling you over. As you leap to safety, the first massive rumbling six-wheeled monstrosity comes to a grinding, sliding halt directly where you had been seconds earlier, as you are enveloped in a massive exhale of hot steam. Atop the still-chugging mechanical wagon, a wild bearded gnome, bedecked in numerous jingling tools and pouches, squints down at you through his dust-smeared goggles, gives you and appraising nod, and then hoots, \"You lot will have ta do. So no time to dawdle. Clamber on aboard, we got thrill'n heroics at pull off and a whole passle of goblins ta put in their places!\" With a wild series of undecipherable hand signals, the gnome appears to want you to climb aboard the wagon.": "你跌跌撞撞地从成堆的垃圾和血肉中走出来，试图弄清刚刚发生的事情--不知何故，几十个妖精就这样随意地用大量的废品、垃圾和牲畜袭击了你。更让你们振奋的是，妖精们有一艘飞行船。正当这种奇怪的感觉沉入心底时，一阵轰隆隆的机械声和蒸汽汽笛的轰鸣声充满了空气，很快就出现了比妖精有飞艇更奇怪的景象。在一片灰尘、烟雾和蒸汽中，四辆巨大的有盖马车--没有任何吃草的动物--以极快的速度冲了过去，差点把你撞倒。当你跳到安全地带时，第一辆巨大的隆隆作响的六轮怪兽直接在你几秒钟前所在的地方滑行停止，因为你被一股巨大的热蒸汽所笼罩。在那辆仍在行驶的机械马车上，一个满脸胡须的野地精，身着无数叮叮当当的工具和袋子，透过他那沾满灰尘的护目镜眯着眼睛看着你，向你点头致意，然后吼道：\"你们这些人必须得做。所以没时间磨蹭了。上船吧，我们有惊心动魄的英雄事迹，还有一大群妖精在等着我们呢！\" 随着一连串难以辨认的手势，地精似乎想让你爬上马车。",

Also, that part of the plan requires them to get these four wagons to a high point further down the road and into the path of the airship.": "在不太可能发生的情况下，NPC没有立即跳上马车，\"捕鼠器 \"试图用恐慌的请求来催促他们。\"你得快点，在我们失去那艘船之前！\"或者：\"没时间闲聊了，我们有地精要停下来！\" 如果这招不管用，他和其他几个地精就会从马车上跳下来，试图把NPC领上船，同时用匆忙而慌乱的语调解释发生了什么，并说他们有一个计划，尽管他们需要NPC的帮助。另外，这个计划的一部分要求他们把这四辆马车弄到路边的一个高点上，并进入飞艇的路径。",
	"Paraphrase the information from the background section and make sure that \"Mousetrap\" highlights the fact that the goblins have the ship's crew and several farm families as prisoners.

	"The effort of hanging on to the wildly bucking and jostling steam wagons as they careen down the rutted roadway and then off of it prevents much conversation with the gnomes. It doesn't take long to realize the wagons are headed towards what looks to be the edge of a sizable canyon and, in the far distance, the hijacked airship. The rumbling wagons come to a screeching halt on the canyon rim and the gnomes rush into the action. They begin ripping tarps off the wagons to reveal what looks to be three huge ballistae. Instead of bolts, the siege weapons are loaded with what can only be described as a trio of clockwork bi-winged flying contraptions. The fourth wagon has a sizable woven basket attached to a gigantic patchwork bladder. \"We got ta hurry and decide who is flying in what before those nasty goblins get within range,\" \"Mousetrap\" hoots as he hurriedly beings cranking one of the ballistae to aim in the general direction of the oncoming airship.": "当蒸汽马车在有车辙的路面上飞驰，然后离开路面时，由于要紧紧抓住这些疯狂摇晃的马车，所以无法与地精们交谈。没过多久，我们就意识到，这些马车正朝着一个相当大的峡谷边缘驶去，在远处，是被劫持的飞艇。轰隆隆的马车在峡谷边缘戛然而止，地精们冲进了行动。他们开始撕掉马车上的防水布，露出看起来是三个巨大的弹炮。攻城武器上装的不是炮弹，而是只能被描述为三个发条的双翼飞行装置。第四辆马车上有一个相当大的编织篮子，连接着一个巨大的拼布囊。\"在那些讨厌的妖精进入射程之前，我们得赶紧决定谁坐什么飞机。\"\"捕鼠器 \"一边叫嚣着，一边匆匆忙忙地摇动其中一个弹弓，瞄准即将到来的飞艇的大致方向。",

So she decided her ogres would just move into whatever settlement they raided, eat all the locals, livestock, and food stores, and then just head to the next settlement they find and do it again. That is the case with the small rural town of Springkernel. This back-country farming community, made up almost entirely of humans and halflings, is the third such town to face the Big Nosh. The ogres are thorough and have not yet left any soul able to give warning of their new pillaging methods. That is why no one in Springkernel ever saw the attack coming.

See the {@creature adult white dragon} stat block for more information on the regional effects.": "这场冒险发生在冬季，而且是在高山上。由于白龙的地区效应，这一点变得加倍糟糕。通常情况下，这种年轻的龙不会成为传奇，但由于在孵化过程中使用了奇怪的黑暗仪式，这对双胞胎被认为是如此。既然如此，区域效应从龙的巢穴延伸的距离从6英里增加到12英里，这意味着它们既影响到通道的最中心部分，也影响到通往塔楼的途径，甚至影响到兽人战营。关于区域效应的更多信息，请参见{@creature adult white dragon}状态块。",

	"A dark cult dedicated to Zannaz the Mirrored God (a version of The {@class warlock||Great Old One warlock patron|great old one}) stole a white dragon egg from a young white dragon. Through dark rites and foul rituals, they tried to birth a two-headed dragon to bend to their will and service. Little did the cult know, the dragon egg had a double yolk. Normally a double yolk only produces a single living dragon, but because of the foul magic, two dragons were born from the egg. The twin white dragons were mentally and spiritually linked, and far more powerful than other white dragons. The cult took this as a sign of blessing from their dark patron. They foolishly lavished the supposed god-blessed dragons with powerful rituals to enhance their already potent abilities, and that was their undoing. The twin dragons' mental abilities and draconic greed were also enhanced, along with their spell casting. Soon, they would not heed the commands of the cult. The dragons gleefully slaughtered their keepers, stole all the magic and wealth the cult had acquired, and went looking to find their own territory to rule. The newly opened and rich gold mine of the Craghearth dwarves was ripe for the taking. The dragons plan to starve out the miners and to bit-by-bit drain the mountain town of its people and resources, until both can easily be taken without much risk to themselves.

	"Focus attacks on a single target whenever possible, until they are slain. Go for rogues, ranged attackers, healers, and spell casters as quick as they make themselves known. If possible, keep flying to thwart melee combatants. Unless a PC declares an action to attack when something comes within melee range, such combat is made nearly useless. Even when declaring such an attack, a PC still gets only a single swing and not all their attacks. Use the dragon's breath weapon as often as you can. As soon as it refreshes, breathe again, as the damage of a breath weapon far exceeds any other damage the dragon can dish out. Do not spare any target from a dragon's wrath. If a target is unconscious or dying, eat them or stomp them. You are not picking on your players; you are roleplaying a dragon. Every dragon fight should be something a PC is never guaranteed to walk away from. Those that do walk away know they earned their lives and possibly a victory over a heinous foe. If the dragon becomes injured, have it use the {@action Dodge} and {@action Disengage} actions to your advantage, and save attacking enemies for Legendary Actions on their turns to make it harder for PCs and their allies to tie the dragon down to one place.

	"Just an hour after dawn, a dwarven messenger bearing the symbol of the Council of Thanes rouses you. \"You have been summoned to the Craghearth Hall of Elders,\" the messenger pronounces in a tone of grim finality. Still wiping the sleep from your eyes, you find yourself inside the expansive interior of the stone and timbered longhouse. You are greeted by six stern-faced and long-bearded dwarven elders. The snowy-haired collection of aged dwarves is the ruling Council of Thanes. You are each given curt acknowledgement from the venerable dwarves and the traditional greeting feast—a simple fare of strong ale, hard bread and heavily salted meats—marking you as a respected and protected guest. aper the draining of three tankards, the eldest of the Thanes, Vori Stonesmile, smooths the ale foam from his snowy mustache and narrows his eyes in a fashion that makes his already face somehow look even more wrinkled. \"We summon ye, one and all, for grim business. The lives of fifty dwarves hangs on the edge of an axe blade. Someone or something has taken control of the mountain pass between here and our newly established mines!\" the old dwarf growls through trembling anger and spits bitterly before continuing. \"The pass is the only way to supply the mine, and three such attempts have already been made to do so. None of those three supply trains have made it to the mine or returned. Now, those fifty souls are in danger of starving or dying from expo- sure, and the fates of those three prior supply trains are a mystery. In my heart, I hope that our missing kin have not met a grim fate. So it seems we are in need of heroes such as ye. We need ye not only to ensure the supplies reach the miners, but also to deal with whatever has taken control of the pass and try to discover the fates of our missing kin. If ye would under- take such, ye will be richly rewarded. What say ye?\" the old dwarf asks grimly underfurrowed and bushy brows.": "就在黎明后的一个小时，一个带着议会标志的矮人信使叫醒了你。\"你被传唤到克拉赫斯长老会大厅，\"信使用一种严峻的最终语气宣布道。你还在擦拭你眼睛上的睡意，你发现自己在石头和木头长屋的广阔内部。迎接你的是六位面容严厉、长髯飘飘的矮人长者。这些白发苍苍的老矮人是执政的泰恩斯委员会。尊敬的矮人对你们每个人都进行了简短的致意，并为你们举行了传统的问候宴会--由浓烈的啤酒、硬面包和重度盐渍的肉类组成的简单食物，标志着你们是受人尊敬和保护的客人。 在喝完三杯酒之后，最年长的酋长沃里-斯通斯米勒抚平了他雪白的胡子上的啤酒泡沫，眯起眼睛，使他本来就不多的脸看起来更加皱巴巴的。\"我们召集你们，所有的人，都是为了严峻的事业。50个矮人的生命悬在斧刃上。有人或东西控制了这里和我们新建立的矿场之间的山口！\"老矮人在颤抖的愤怒中咆哮，并在继续之前痛苦地吐了一口唾沫。\"这个山口是供应矿场的唯一途径，已经有三次这样的尝试了。这三辆补给列车都没有到达矿区或返回。现在，那50个灵魂正处于饥饿或死于爆炸的危险之中，而之前那三辆补给列车的命运是个谜。在我的心里，我希望我们失踪的亲属没有遇到严峻的命运。因此，我们似乎需要像你们这样的英雄。我们需要你们不仅要确保补给品到达矿工手中，还要对付控制山口的任何东西，并试图发现我们失踪亲属的命运。如果你们愿意接受这样的任务，你们将得到丰厚的回报。你们怎么说？\"老矮人皱着浓密的眉毛，面无表情地问道。",

	"No matter how hard it felt for you to finally arrive at the mine, it is nothing compared to the pain and torture the miners look to have endured. The few bearded faces that manage to stir and greet you are hollow-cheeked and haggard. The temporary tents and lean-tos have been used for wrapping hands and feet or burnt for warmth. The mine itself became their only shelter from the winter cold. Food was but a dream a week ago when the last leather belts and boots were used for soup. Of the fifty miners, only five are able to walk or even stand. One of the five makes a great show of trying to straighten his ragged and patchwork clothing before stepping up to you proudly. He gives each of you a grim nod, before saying, \"Good of ye ta come.

The miners had nearly given up hope of aid when the PCs arrive. If asked, Grumby can give the PCs a rough idea of where the {@area Orc War Camp|C|x} is, but knows little else of worth to the PCs.

	"So, at any given moment, until their lair is attacked, one twin dragon will be in the treasure hoard cavern, while the other is on guard—inside/atop the tower or lurking around the rubble outside the tower or flying watch around the area of the storms. If one decides to go hunting, then the other will take up watch until the hunter returns. Once either twin is attacked at the tower or below, the other will head to its sibling to aid in the battle, arriving {@dice 1d4} rounds later. If the battle takes place in or around the Watchtower and is going badly for the dragons, the twins will retreat down into their treasure cavern as quickly as possible. The dragons will hurriedly consume as many of the healing potions as possible. One dragon will use a ready action to fight any foes that come down into the lair. The other dragon will use the exit tunnel and come around and attack the foes from the opposite side, essentially making the foes fight on two fronts.": "因此，在任何时候，在它们的巢穴被攻击之前，一条双龙会在藏宝洞中，而另一条则在塔内/塔顶警戒，或潜伏在塔外的瓦砾中，或在风暴区周围飞行监视。如果一个人决定去打猎，那么另一个人就会负责守卫，直到猎人回来。一旦任何一个双胞胎在塔上或塔下受到攻击，另一个就会前往其兄弟姐妹处协助战斗，并在{@dice 1d4}回合后到达。如果战斗发生在守望塔内或周围，并且对龙来说情况很糟，那么这对双胞胎会尽快撤退到他们的藏宝洞里。巨龙们将匆忙地消耗尽可能多的治疗药水。一条龙将使用准备行动来对抗任何下到巢穴中的敌人。另一条龙将利用出口通道，从对面绕过来攻击敌人，基本上使敌人在两条战线上作战。",
	"A fifteen-foot wide and fifteen-foot tall rough-hewn tunnel runs in a direct path fifty feet from the cavern directly beneath the tower, where the rubble from above has piled to a forty-foot-wide ovoid cavern with a highly domed ceiling. The soaring ceiling is nearly 100 feet high at its peak and riddled with sword-like icicles (see {@creature Gelid-Frost Twin Young White Dragons|RolledTold5|Gelidfrost Lair Actions}). Piled at the dead center of the cavern is the twin dragons' treasure hoard. The trove, the walls, and the entire floor of the cavern is covered in a {@object ice wall|RolledTold5|sheet of ice}. The floor and the hoard area are difficult terrain, due to the ice. Because of the many scrapes, scratches, and furrows made from the dragons' claws, there is little risk of losing one's footing and dropping {@condition prone}, so no {@skill Acrobatics} checks are required as on other icy areas. Along with the treasure there are a dozen humanoid bodies frozen about the floor and against the walls. The frozen corpses are a mixture of dwarves and orcs. These are some of the twins' victims and several of them have been half eaten and refrozen for a later snack.": "一条十五英尺宽、十五英尺高的粗凿隧道从塔楼正下方的洞穴直行五十英尺，上面的碎石堆积成一个四十英尺宽的卵形洞穴，天花板高度圆顶。高耸的天花板在顶峰时有近100英尺高，上面布满了剑状的冰柱（见（%0%））。洞穴的死角处堆放着双龙的宝藏。宝库、墙壁和整个洞穴的地板都被{@object ice wall|RolledTold5|sheet of ice}所覆盖。由于冰层的存在，地板和宝库区域是困难的地形。因为有许多龙爪造成的刮痕、划痕和沟壑，所以几乎没有失足和跌落的风险（%2%），所以不需要像其他冰区那样进行（%3%）检查。与宝藏一起的还有十几具冻在地上和靠墙的人形尸体。这些冰冻的尸体是矮人和兽人的混合物。这些是双胞胎的一些受害者，其中有几个已经被吃了一半，并被重新冷冻起来作为以后的点心。",
	"There are a few items of interest on two of the corpses that the dragons failed to find (see below).

	"The twin dragons, though both smarter than your average white dragon, are just as vain and even more confident than others of their breed. They will tactically retreat if necessary, but not run fully from a fight in or around their lair. They will not leave their hoard exposed for the taking and will fight until slain. Since the twins are linked and are now considered legendary, they are twice as dangerous as any single dragon. But since they share a pool of hit points (though they have their own stat blocks and actions), PCs are not trying to defeat two separate dragons. Nevertheless, the duo is going to be a very challenging fight for characters of the PCs' level. Because of this, the treasure reward has been doubled from what a single dragon would have acquired.": "这对双胞胎龙虽然都比一般的白龙聪明，但也同样虚荣，甚至比其他同类更加自信。如果有必要，它们会在战术上撤退，但不会在巢穴内或周围的战斗中完全逃跑。他们不会让自己的囤积物暴露在外面，会一直战斗到被杀死。由于这对双胞胎是连在一起的，现在被认为是传奇，它们的危险性是任何单体龙的两倍。但由于它们共享一个命中率（尽管它们有自己的状态块和行动），所以NPC并不是在试图击败两条独立的龙。尽管如此，对于NPC级别的角色来说，这对二人组将是一场非常具有挑战性的战斗。正因为如此，宝藏的奖励比单龙所获得的要多出一倍。",
