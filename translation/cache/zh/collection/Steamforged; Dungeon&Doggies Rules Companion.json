	"The rules presented here allow you to play humankind's (or elvenkind's, or dwarvenkind's etc.) Best Friend, the noble and companionable dog. There are racial rules, class options, feats and other rules to allow for the addition of a dog character to a party or even a whole party of canine adventurers": "这里介绍的规则允许你扮演人类（或精灵族，或矮人族等）最好的朋友--高贵的、可陪伴的狗。这里有种族规则、等级选择、特技和其他规则，允许在聚会中增加一个狗的角色，甚至是整个犬类冒险者的聚会。",
	"There is a unique delight in providing rules to play a dog character. There are few, if any animals that are as closely bonded to humans as dogs, and they have been our companions and partners for a long period of history. So it feels somehow right that they get their time at the table with other adventurers!": "提供扮演狗的角色的规则，有一种独特的喜悦。如果说有什么动物能像狗一样与人类紧密相连的话，那也是很少的，而且它们在很长的历史时期内一直是我们的伴侣和伙伴。因此，让它们和其他冒险者一起在桌子上玩耍，感觉是很正确的。",
	"The style of play described for dogs assumes they will fulfill that role of companion and support, with dogs being both self sufficient and - through their class choices - a very supportive part of the adventuring party": "为狗描述的游戏风格假定它们将履行伴侣和支持的角色，狗既是自给自足的，又是--通过它们的等级选择--冒险队伍中非常有支持力的一部分。",
	"Note that these rules are not intended to represent anthropomorphic dogs; no bipedal, opposable thumb-owning dogs here! Instead, they assume some manner of event that has imbued a dog with intellectual awakening and self awareness without altering their physical makeup.": "请注意，这些规则并不是为了代表拟人化的狗；这里没有两足动物，也没有拥有对立拇指的狗！相反，它们假设某种事件使狗具有智力觉醒和自我意识，而不改变它们的身体结构。相反，它们假定某种事件使狗具有智力觉醒和自我意识，而不改变其身体构成。",
	"As such, there are a few assumptions made to ensure that the character you create can interact with the wider world. Communication and tool use are both discussed within these rules and options for new equipment ideas are also suggested.": "因此，有一些假设，以确保你创建的角色能够与更广泛的世界互动。在这些规则中讨论了交流和工具的使用，同时也提出了新的装备理念的选择。",
	"Some canine classes are easier to imagine than other, though with a little thought, no class option becomes completely impossible to integrate into your DM's world. The best course is to talk to your fellow players and ensure everyone is on a similar page with your ideas.": "有些犬类比其他犬类更容易想象，不过只要稍加思考，就没有什么犬类选项是完全无法融入你的DM世界的。最好的办法是与你的同伴交谈，确保每个人都与你的想法相一致。",
	"The miniature figure you choose to represent your canine adventurer gives you plenty of clues as to the ways they could interact with the world.For example, a dog wizard has a spell-book in its harness. Does that mean your dog can read? Or the rogue with a dagger held in its tail, has it now gained an extra prehensile limb? None of these questions or answers should prevent the fun from happening at the table. In a world filled with fire-breathing flying lizards, a dog able to fire a crossbow shouldn't be beyond the realms of possibility.": "你选择的代表你的犬类冒险家的微型人物为你提供了大量的线索，说明他们可以与这个世界互动。例如，狗巫师的背带里有一本法术书。这是否意味着你的狗会阅读？或者尾巴上夹着一把匕首的流氓，它现在是不是多了一个无柄的肢体？这些问题或答案都不应该妨碍餐桌上的乐趣。在一个充满喷火飞蜥的世界里，一只能够发射弩箭的狗不应该超出可能性的范围。",
	"The most important thing is that your dog characters get to feel sufficiently ‘doggy' in the way the rules support the role playing. Whether as a single canine member of a traditional adventuring group or as part of a complete pack of hounds out to make their mark on the world; have fun, sniff a few trees and always - {@i always} - enjoy a good belly rub now and again! ": "最重要的是，在规则支持的角色扮演中，你的狗角色能充分感受到 \"狗性\"。无论是作为传统冒险团的单一犬类成员，还是作为完整的猎犬群的一部分，都要在这个世界上留下自己的印记；玩得开心，闻一闻几棵树，总是--{@i always}--时不时地享受一下腹部的摩擦吧",
	"Before starting your doggie adventures, it is worth deciding what role dog characters play in your world. Most right-thinking folk will want lots of interesting four-legged friends in their games, but that might not suit everyone, so below are some ideas on how to best handle having canine characters in your adventures:": "在开始你的狗狗冒险之前，值得决定狗狗角色在你的世界中扮演什么角色。大多数有思想的人都希望在他们的游戏中出现许多有趣的四条腿的朋友，但这可能不适合所有人，所以下面是一些关于如何最好地处理冒险中的犬类角色的想法。",
	"Your character is one of a kind! It can be a great roleplaying opportunity to be the only adventurous dog in the world capable of holding their own with their bipedal counterparts. This idea has the character as a marvellous spectacle, sure to be commented on frequently and subject to their own plots involving foes attempting to kidnap the dog, or other adventures. It might inspire the DM and players to consider why they are so unique, or build a game around discovering the source of the character's abilities. Is it a curse or a gift?": "你的角色是独一无二的! 如果你是世界上唯一的冒险犬，能够与两足动物的同类相抗衡，这可能是一个很好的角色扮演的机会。这个想法让这个角色成为一个奇妙的奇观，肯定会经常被人评论，并受到他们自己的阴谋的影响，包括试图绑架狗的敌人，或其他冒险。这可能会激励DM和玩家考虑他们为什么如此独特，或者围绕发现角色能力的来源来建立一个游戏。它是诅咒还是天赋？",
	"Rather than being truly unique in the doggie world, perhaps there is only one of each breed that has reached the height of adventurer? Questions to answer, either before the campaign or during play, include–what happens when a character dies (of old age, or adventurous causes!)? Does another Chihuahua become \"awakened\" when the previous adventurer finally lays down their head? Or are these just the first brave souls, the spearhead of many more to come? The characters are likely individuals of note in the world and many plots and adventures will focus purely on their existence.": "与其说在狗的世界里是真正独特的，不如说每个品种中只有一个达到了冒险家的高度？无论是在活动前还是在游戏中，需要回答的问题包括：当一个角色死亡时（因年老或冒险原因！）会发生什么？当前一个冒险家最终躺下的时候，另一个吉娃娃是否会被 \"唤醒\"？或者，这些只是第一批勇敢的灵魂，是未来更多的先锋？这些人物很可能是这个世界上值得注意的个人，许多情节和冒险将纯粹以他们的存在为重点。",
	"A common issue canine adventurers will encounter is a lack of hands. DMs and players should not shy away from exploring this issue; dogs are quite unique and overcoming this issue is a roleplaying and story opportunity. Maybe your character uses a pouch with spell components in easy muzzle reach? Maybe the local Smith can modify tools for mouth use? Perhaps you use magic? Or perhaps you just have your companions help you? Figuring out the ways you adapt to your new place in the world is part of the fun of being a dog in a thumb-owner's world!": "犬类冒险者会遇到的一个常见问题是缺乏双手。管理员和玩家不应回避对这个问题的探讨；狗是相当独特的，克服这个问题是一个角色扮演和故事的机会。也许你的角色使用了一个装着法术组件的袋子，在嘴边就能拿到？也许当地的史密斯可以修改工具以便于口中使用？也许你使用魔法？或者你只是让你的同伴们帮助你？想办法适应你在这个世界上的新位置，这也是在拇指主人的世界里做一只狗的乐趣之一。",
	"Talking, adventuring dogs are not uncommon in the world with this approach–but the characters are among the best and brightest, with one or more making up part of any group. Many songs are sung in the tavern of doggie heroes, past and present; most adventuring groups have one or more canine companions, they're not at all unusual. It's likely that there are specialist shops selling dog-optimised gear and taverns with an attached Kennel Club, catering for doggies with a menu of meaty treats and comfortable lounging couches. In this world, DMs should remember that villainous foes might include clever canines–indeed the major mastermind behind a nefarious plot could be... a wicked Labrador!": "会说话的、冒险的狗在这个世界上并不少见--但这些人物都是最优秀、最聪明的，任何团体中都有一只或多只狗组成的。酒馆里唱着许多关于过去和现在的狗狗英雄的歌曲；大多数冒险团体都有一个或多个犬类伙伴，他们一点也不稀奇。很可能有专门的商店出售适合狗狗的装备，酒馆里还有一个附属的犬舍俱乐部，用肉质的食物和舒适的躺椅来满足狗狗们的需求。在这个世界上，DM应该记住，反派的敌人可能包括聪明的犬类--事实上，邪恶阴谋背后的主要策划者可能是......一只邪恶的拉布拉多犬！\"。",
	"Who wouldn't want a world full of four-legged friends? Using this principle, doggie characters are as commonplace and normal as any other race. The world has adapted around them, with most buildings being constructed with dogs as well as humanoids in mind. There is a furry friend in all walks of life from city leaders, to army regiments, bankers, bakers or candlestick makers! Talking dogs have always been a part of the world, and it's all perfectly natural. The DM should give some thought to \"dogs gone bad\" and what a group of canine bandits and ruffians might look like. A bad dog could easily be the major antagonist of a story. No one wants to contemplate a St Bernard transformed into a Lich, with a horde of undead followers though, surely...?": "谁不希望有一个充满四条腿的朋友的世界？利用这一原则，狗的角色就像其他种族一样普遍和正常。这个世界已经围绕着它们进行了调整，大多数建筑物的建造都考虑到了狗和人类。从城市领导到军队团员、银行家、面包师或烛台制造者，各行各业都有一个毛茸茸的朋友! 会说话的狗一直是这个世界的一部分，这一切都非常自然。DM应该考虑一下 \"坏狗\"，以及一群狗匪和流氓可能是什么样子。一只坏狗很容易成为故事中的主要对立面。没有人愿意考虑让圣伯纳犬变成一个巫师，并有一大群不死的追随者，当然......？",
	"The more commonly intelligent dogs are encountered, the more the world should reflect this. Equipment and weapon makers will tailor their wares for wealthy doggy adventurers, canine guilds will form, dogs will seek positions of power and influence - and not every doggie is as altruistic as some... underdog crime gangs are a real and exciting threat, able to hide within society easily due to the 'two-legs' being so bad at identifying individual dogs.": "遇到的聪明狗越多，世界就越应该反映这一点。装备和武器制造商将为富有的狗冒险家定制他们的产品，犬类行会将形成，狗将寻求权力和影响力的位置--而且不是每只狗都像某些狗那样无私......劣质犯罪团伙是一个真实而令人兴奋的威胁，由于 \"两脚 \"如此不善于识别个别狗，他们能够轻易地隐藏在社会中。",
	"Endlessly variable, constantly adaptable, dogs have been shaped by their entwined history with other races until little trace of their wild ancestry remains. Now, a breed of dog seems to exist for every possible niche within society and for every task. From great shaggy hunting dogs to the tiniest of lapdogs, the variety of the canine form seems without bounds.": "狗的变化无穷，适应性强，它们与其他种族的历史纠缠在一起，直到它们的野生祖先几乎没有留下痕迹。现在，社会上每一个可能的利基和每一项任务似乎都有一种狗的品种。从巨大的毛茸茸的猎犬到最微小的哈巴狗，犬类的种类似乎没有界限。",
	"Generally dogs tend to live between 10 and 15 years and reach adulthood around 18 months old. Whilst it is usual for dogs to live with families or individuals of other races, dogs will also form their own groups for strength and companionship. A wide array of natural colours and coats occur and thus individual dogs are easily identified by other races visually, even though they rely more on their sense of smell for such things themselves.": "一般来说，狗的寿命在10到15年之间，在18个月大时达到成年。虽然狗通常与其他种族的家庭或个人生活在一起，但狗也会为了力量和伴侣关系而组成自己的团体。它们有各种各样的天然颜色和外套，因此其他种族的狗很容易从视觉上识别它们，尽管它们自己更依赖嗅觉来判断。",
	"Dogs are naturally loyal to those they sense as a pack. This trait carries through to intelligent dogs from their wilder kin. Those who claim a dog as a friend have a true and unshakeable companion for life. Affable and upbeat, dogs live for the now and enjoy experiencing curiosity and adventure. They have few emotional filters and can switch from effervescent joy to melancholy in a moment. However they shed black moods very easily and seem incapable of holding a grudge or harbouring ill feeling.": "狗天生就对它们感觉到的群体很忠诚。这种特质从它们的野性亲属延续到了聪明的狗。那些把狗当作朋友的人拥有一个真正的、不可动摇的生活伴侣。犬类平易近人、乐观向上，为现在而活，喜欢体验好奇心和冒险。它们没有什么情感过滤器，可以在瞬间从兴高采烈的喜悦转换为忧郁。然而，它们很容易摆脱黑色情绪，似乎不可能记仇或怀恨在心。",
	"Dogs are easily moved to help others and relieve suffering and will be generous with their affection and time.": "狗很容易被感动，帮助他人，解除痛苦，并会慷慨地给予它们感情和时间。",
	"Dogs have the capacity to make their homes almost anywhere that they choose, but the most common places they are found is within the settlements of other races, acting in a wide range of roles. Wild dogs do also thrive under different circumstances in the more temperate areas of the world. Intelligent dogs tend to remain closely linked with either their adopted society or the wild areas they knew as pups. However, a dog's sense of home is usually defined by their company rather than a place, and dogs are comfortable travelling widely as long as they have the constancy of friendship.": "狗有能力在它们选择的几乎任何地方安家，但它们最常见的地方是在其他种族的定居点内，扮演着各种各样的角色。在世界较温和的地区，野狗也确实在不同的环境中茁壮成长。聪明的狗往往与它们收养的社会或它们在幼年时熟悉的野生地区保持密切联系。然而，狗的家的感觉通常是由它们的同伴而不是一个地方来定义的，只要有恒久的友谊，狗就能适应广泛的旅行。",
	"Dogs gifted with unusual intelligence seek adventure for many reasons. It is common that answers to questions about why they are different to their kind are a driving force, but equally the desire to make a difference will motivate many dogs. Their instinctive urge to support and assist, coupled with the ability to reflect on the world in deep terms can be more than enough to lead a dog from the warmth of a home and into the wider world.": "具有不寻常智慧的狗出于许多原因寻求冒险。常见的情况是，回答关于它们为什么与同类不同的问题是一种驱动力，但同样地，想要有所作为的愿望也会激励许多狗。它们有支持和协助的本能冲动，再加上对世界进行深刻反思的能力，这些都足以引导狗狗离开温暖的家，进入更广阔的世界。",
	"The diversity of dogs is hard to generalise but dogs begin with the following traits.": "狗的多样性很难概括，但狗开始时有以下特征。",
	"Your Charisma score increases by 1": "你的魅力值增加1",
	"Dogs reach maturity around 18 months and usually live between 10 and 15 years.": "狗在18个月左右达到成熟期，通常寿命在10到15年之间。",
	"Dogs tend towards good alignments due to their natural urge to be helpful, but there are exceptions to this.": "由于狗有乐于助人的天性，它们倾向于良好的排列组合，但也有例外情况。",
	"Dogs vary in height and length enormously. Your size is dependent on your subrace, see below.": "狗的身高和体长有很大的不同。你的尺寸取决于你的亚种，见下文。",
	"Your base walking speed is 30 feet.": "你的基本行走速度是30英尺。",
	"You can ‘speak' and read Common and two extra languages of your choice. Note that dogs do not necessarily use speech; whilst they can understand their chosen languages, the specifics of how they communicate are left to the players. Some possibilities include having the full ability of speech, being uncannily effective at conveying meaning through gesture and sounds (\"I think she is saying the kids are down the well\") or having another character who can understand and interpret for the dog. Regardless of how the dog expresses itself, it is assumed that it is communicating with its allies with sufficient fluency as to avoid any penalties to rolls.": "你可以 \"说 \"和读普通话以及你选择的两种额外语言。请注意，狗不一定会说话；虽然它们能听懂自己选择的语言，但它们如何交流的具体细节则由玩家决定。一些可能性包括拥有完全的语言能力，通过手势和声音不可思议地有效传达意思（\"我想她在说孩子们在井里\"），或者有另一个角色可以理解并为狗解释。无论狗是如何表达的，我们都认为它是以足够流畅的方式与它的盟友交流，以避免对卷轴的任何惩罚。",
	"Dogs have advantage on Perception checks based on smell or hearing and disadvantage on Perception checks depending upon colour recognition.": "狗在基于嗅觉或听觉的感知检查中具有优势，在基于颜色识别的感知检查中具有劣势。",
	"Dogs may cast the {@spell Charm Person} spell using Charisma as the spellcasting ability once per long rest. No spell components are necessary. The DC for this ability is 8 + your Charisma modifier.": "狗可以用魅力作为施法能力，每长时休息一次，施放（%0%）的法术。不需要任何法术组件。这个能力的DC是8+你的魅力修改器。",
	"You have a natural bite attack.You are proficient with this attack and it counts as both a weapon attack and an unarmed attack. This attack does {@dice 1d4} + your Strength modifier damage. This increases to {@dice 1d6} + your Strength modifier at level 5 and {@dice 1d8} + your Strength modifier at level 10.": "你有一个自然的咬合攻击。你精通这个攻击，它既是武器攻击也是徒手攻击。该攻击造成{@dice 1d4}+你力量修饰的伤害。5级时增加到{@dice 1d6}+你的力量修正值，10级时增加到{@dice 1d8}+你的力量修正值。",
	"Dogs have such variety of shapes and breeds that they are highly diverse. Choose one of the following subraces to reflect your chosen breeding and select one Breed Ability from the list on the right.": "狗的形状和品种如此之多，以至于它们具有高度的多样性。选择以下一个子种族来反映你所选择的育种，并从右边的列表中选择一个品种能力。",
	"Dogs as presented are a powerful race with many benefits. However, as any dog owner will know, dog's lives are brief and intense. An intelligent dog will have to accept that its fellow adventurers will outlive it, maybe many times over, and the quest to extend the life of a canine adventurer may form the basis of some powerful story telling. Equally, the same dog may choose to accept its balloted time and live its live as fully as it can and do the most possible with the time it has.": "呈现的狗是一个强大的种族，有许多好处。然而，正如任何狗主人所知道的，狗的生命是短暂而紧张的。一只聪明的狗将不得不接受它的同伴会比它活得更久，也许是很多倍，而延长犬类冒险家的生命的探索可能会形成一些强有力的故事的基础。同样，这只狗可能会选择接受它被选中的时间，尽可能充分地活着，并尽可能地利用它的时间。",
	"Big dogs are the strongest, and most physically imposing animals in the canine family. Mastiffs, St Bernards, and Alsatians all fall into this size of breed.": "大狗是犬科动物中最强壮、身体最强壮的动物。马士提夫犬、圣伯纳犬和阿尔萨斯犬都属于这种规模的犬种。",
	"Your size is Medium": "你的尺寸是中号",
	"Your Constitution score increases by 1.": "你的体质得分增加1。",
	"When you use your bite attack, you roll two dice for damage and choose the higher result. For a critical hit, roll three dice and choose the best two results.": "当你使用你的咬人攻击时，你掷两个骰子来计算伤害，并选择较高的结果。对于关键一击，掷三个骰子，选择最好的两个结果。",
	"Regular dogs may be the most common sized dogs and tend to be known for energy and hale sturdiness. This includes spaniels, bulldogs, and many crossbreeds.": "普通犬可能是最常见的大小犬，往往以精力充沛和精神矍铄著称。这包括西班牙猎犬、斗牛犬和许多杂交品种。",

You may choose {@b two} of these abilities at level 1.": "狗是一个几乎无限变化的物种，因此，由亚种和以下品种能力来代表。这些都是为了帮助反映狗的某种繁殖或经典角色而闻名。你可以在1级时选择这些能力中的（%0%）。",

	"You have a strong and powerful mouth and neck. When you succeed in hitting a creature of your size or smaller with your Bite attack you may also declare it is grappled.

	"Shrieks and further wails accompanied this development, but these swiftly turned to gasps of awe as the girl's body relaxed, and curls of dark smoke began to pour from her eyes and mouth. Cassandra leaned forward and licked her forehead. The symbol of the good Mother flared for a moment, and was then gone.": "尖叫和进一步的哀号伴随着这一发展，但随着女孩身体的放松，这些迅速变成了敬畏的喘息声，卷曲的黑烟开始从她的眼睛和嘴里涌出。卡桑德拉俯身向前，舔了舔她的额头。好母亲的标志闪耀了一会儿，然后就消失了。",

	"Cerysse looked around, her large brown eyes alert for need; calm, even in the midst of a heated skirmish. She located the source of the yell–a tall, sandy-haired elf was backing away from the melee, an arrow buried deep in her ribs–a serious wound. The elf, ashen-faced, staggered and nearly fell. The rest of the party closed ranks to protect her retreat, carrying on the fight against the band of gnolls that had been tormenting the village for months until their arrival.": "塞瑞丝环顾四周，她那双棕色的大眼睛警惕地寻找着需要；即使在激烈的争斗中也很平静。她找到了吼叫声的来源--一个高大的沙发精灵正从混战中后退，一支箭深深地埋在她的肋骨里--一个严重的伤口。这名精灵脸色苍白，踉踉跄跄，差点摔倒。队伍中的其他人收拢队伍，保护她的退路，继续与那群在他们到来之前已经折磨了村子好几个月的地精战斗。",
	"Cerysse bounded over, and thrust her great brown and white head under the elf's shoulder, her broad neck supporting the wounded fighter. She guided her patient to a nearby stump and let her sit. Cerysse's sensitive nose quickly ascertained that the wound had pierced flesh and muscle, and also a lung. Time was of the essence. The elf was already beginning to wheeze. Soon her lungs would fill with fluid and collapse. Drawing on her deep reserves of empathy and composure, Cerysse called upon the mercy of {@deity the Good Mother|Canine|Dungeons&Doggies}, the canine deity dedicated to nurturing and defending all who needed her help. Strength and power flooded through Cerysse and she grabbed the arrow's shaft with her powerful jaws.": "塞瑞丝跳了过来，把她巨大的棕白色脑袋伸到精灵的肩膀下，她宽阔的脖子支撑着这个受伤的战士。她把她的病人引导到附近的一个树桩上，让她坐下。塞瑞丝敏感的鼻子很快就确定，伤口刺穿了肉和肌肉，还有一个肺部。时间是至关重要的。这名精灵已经开始喘息了。很快，她的肺部就会充满液体而崩溃。利用她深藏的同情心和冷静，塞瑞丝呼唤{@deity the Good Mother|Canine|Dungeons&Doggies}的怜悯，犬类的神灵致力于培育和保护所有需要她帮助的人。力量和权力充斥着塞瑞丝，她用她强有力的下巴抓住了箭杆。",
	"As the healing spell took effect, and with one gentle paw holding the elf still, Cerysse drew the arrow from the wound in one swift movement. The whole task was so quickly accomplished that the elf didn't even have time to scream. Her body tensed, then relaxed as the healing power closed her wounds and restored her strength. She began to rise, to rejoin the fight": "随着愈合咒语的生效，用一只温柔的爪子按住精灵不动，塞瑞丝迅速地从伤口中拔出了箭。整个任务完成得如此迅速，以至于精灵甚至没有时间尖叫。她的身体绷紧了，然后放松了，因为治疗的力量封闭了她的伤口并恢复了她的力量。她开始起身，重新加入战斗。",
	"Cerysse's firm paw on her shoulder stopped the elf in her tracks. The huge St Bernard drew in a slow breath, checking for further wounds. Satisfied there were none, Cerysse sat back on her haunches. The elf paused for just one more second to throw her arms around their healer in thanks, then raced back to the fray. Cerysse took a moment to check her stock of healing potions and to tidy the pouches of bandages back into place, and surveyed the battle for her next task.": "塞丽斯放在她肩上的坚实的爪子让精灵停下了脚步。这只巨大的圣伯纳犬缓慢地吸了一口气，检查是否有进一步的伤口。在对没有伤口感到满意后，塞瑞丝坐回了她的腿上。精灵又停了一秒钟，用她的双臂抱住他们的治疗者以示感谢，然后飞快地回到了战场。塞瑞丝花了点时间检查她的治疗药水库存，并将绷带袋整理回原位，然后为她的下一个任务检查了战斗。",
	"Sir Cornelius whirled around and looked behind him. This time he could have sworn that another dog was sniffing his... his... behind. But there was no dog there, just the empty road, and fields either side. Cornelius was mortified–true, ordinary dogs did occasionally mistake him for one of them and introduce themselves in the only way their unenlightened minds knew how. But usually a quiet word from him in the human tongue confused them enough to forestall the indignity and send them on their way. But this seemed different somehow, and not just because of the absence of an actual animal. Cornelius shook himself, settling his various bags and pouches, and the precious books of magic, and continued on, checking occasionally behind him, just in case.": "科尼利厄斯爵士转过身来，看着他身后。这一次，他可以发誓，另一只狗正在嗅他的......他的......背后。但那里没有狗，只有空荡荡的道路和两边的田地。科尼利厄斯感到羞愧--的确，普通的狗偶尔会把他误认为是它们中的一员，并以它们未开化的头脑所知道的唯一方式介绍自己。但通常情况下，他用人类的语言悄悄地说一句话，就足以让它们迷惑不解，从而避免了这种羞辱，让它们继续前进。但这次似乎有些不同，不仅仅是因为没有一个真正的动物。科尼利厄斯摇了摇头，安顿好他的各种袋子和包，以及珍贵的魔法书，继续前进，偶尔看看身后，以防万一。",
	"Later that evening, while stirring the cooking pot, the feeling came again. But this time, there was not even the smallest of doubts–he was in the middle of the camp, surrounded by his party. They would have said something if another dog wandered into the camp and started to get...friendly. Cornelius shuddered–the humiliation that would come from reverting to a dog's base instincts horrified him.": "那天晚上，在搅拌锅的时候，这种感觉再次出现。但这一次，连最小的怀疑都没有了，他在营地的中间，被他的队伍包围着。如果有另一只狗闯入营地并开始变得......友好，他们会说些什么。科尼利厄斯不寒而栗--恢复到狗的基本本能所带来的羞辱让他感到恐惧。",
	"There was, he reasoned, a similarity between each incident–and it had been happening with increasing frequency over the last few days. Each time he'd been in a contemplative, abstract mood, mulling over nothing in particular–his mind had been receptive. This must be explored further.": "他推断，每次事件之间都有一个相似之处--在过去的几天里，这种情况发生得越来越频繁。每次他都处于一种沉思、抽象的情绪中，对任何特别的事情进行思考--他的头脑都能接受。这一点必须进一步探讨。",
	"After dinner, Cornelius shrugged out of his armour and settled himself down with Graycie, his halfing friend, nearby, and prepared. He ran through a series of meditations that he normally used when rehearsing his spells, taking himself out of the moment and deep within himself. Then, when he was completely calm, he reached out.": "晚饭后，科尼利厄斯甩掉了他的盔甲，把自己安顿下来，他的混血朋友格雷西就在附近，并做好准备。他进行了一系列的冥想，他通常在排练法术时使用这些冥想，使自己脱离当下，深入自己的内心。然后，当他完全平静下来时，他伸出了手。",
	"Almost instantly, he felt the presence of another. It was nothing like the humans he adventured with, this feeling. It was more...Cornelius reached for an analogy... like being in a pack–almost like a litter of puppies, tumbled together, blind, snuffling around for comfort.": "几乎在瞬间，他就感觉到了另一个人的存在。这种感觉与和他一起冒险的人类完全不同。它更像是......科尼利厄斯打了个比方......就像在一个包里--几乎就像一窝小狗，翻来覆去地在一起，盲目地在周围嗅着，寻求安慰。",
	"Cornelius recoiled from the contact, his eyes snapping open.": "科尼利厄斯因接触而退缩，他的眼睛猛然睁开。",
	"There were others just like him...": "还有其他像他一样的人...",

	"Three weeks later Thaia, holding the squirming puppy, tailed Surevere away from the village. He walked with an assurance that belied his advanced years, through the moonlight, and up to the Ridge. There, in a small clearing in the dense forest, he halted. Abruptly a piece of the forest launched itself across the clearing, and onto Surevere. The two of them rolled around on the floor, terrifying growls echoing through the wood. After a moment of frozen terror, Thaia did the only thing she could think of - she picked up a rock and threw it at the hideous beast. At this, the creature turned, teeth bared, and flung itself towards her. Thaia screamed and threw herself onto the floor, protecting the puppy in her arms. She waited for death.": "三个星期后，泰雅抱着蠕动的小狗，尾随苏雷维尔离开了村庄。他带着与他的年岁不符的自信，穿过月光，走到山脊上。在那里，在密林中的一个小空地上，他停了下来。突然间，森林中的一块东西越过空地，飞到了苏雷维尔身上。他们两个人在地上打滚，可怕的咆哮声在树林中回荡。恐怖僵持了一会儿后，泰雅做了她唯一能想到的事情--她捡起一块石头，向那只狰狞的野兽扔去。这时，那怪物转过身来，呲牙咧嘴地朝她扑来。泰雅尖叫起来，把自己扔到地上，保护着怀里的小狗。她等待着死亡。",

A dog that looked suspiciously like the puppy in her arms. She looked questioningly towards Surevere.": "泰雅抬起头来。那个生物就坐在她旁边的凳子上。现在她仔细一看，它似乎是一只狗。一只巨大的狗，有斑驳的皮毛和黑色的耳朵。这只狗看起来很像她怀里的小狗。她疑惑地看向苏雷韦尔。",
	"\"The Taimavar.\" He held up a hand to forestall Thaia's questions. \"You will understand soon enough, Thaia.\" Surevere said. \"Put the puppy on the floor.\"": "\"泰玛瓦人。\" 他举起一只手，阻止了泰雅的提问。\"你很快就会明白的，泰雅。\" 苏雷韦尔说。\"把小狗放在地上。\"",
	"With only a tiny hesitation, Thaia did so. The Taimavar sniffed at the puppy, who emitted a tiny growl and nipped at the larger animal's nose. This seemed to satisfy the Taimavar, who began to murmur under its breath. The puppy ceased fidgeting, and stared in rapt attention at the creature towering over it. A wind blew from nowhere, and leaves began to rise in a whirlwind centred on the puppy, which slowly rose into the air, eyes still locked onto the larger dog's gaze. Then, as it turned in the gentle cyclone, the puppy transferred its attention to Thaia. Now there was something different in its expression - something intelligent, and as their eyes met, Thaia felt a jolt of recognition, and connection.": "泰雅只是稍微犹豫了一下，就这么做了。泰玛瓦嗅了嗅小狗，小狗发出了一声细微的咆哮，并咬了咬大动物的鼻子。这似乎让泰玛尔满意，它开始在口中喃喃自语。小狗停止了躁动，全神贯注地盯着高高在上的生物。一阵风不知从哪里吹来，树叶开始以小狗为中心刮起旋风，它慢慢地升到空中，眼睛仍然锁定在大狗的目光上。然后，当它在温柔的旋风中转身时，小狗把它的注意力转移到了泰雅身上。现在，它的表情有些不同--有些智慧，当它们的目光相遇时，泰雅感到一种认同和联系的冲击。",
	"Abruptly, the wind died down, and the puppy plopped back onto the forest floor.": "突然间，风停了下来，小狗又扑倒在森林的地上。",
	" It turned and once again regarded Thaia with that new thoughtfulness, then it turned back to the larger animal.": " 它转过身来，再一次用那种新的深思熟虑来看待泰雅，然后它又转回了那只大的动物。",
	"\"What is your name?\" The Taimavar asked.": "\"你叫什么名字？\" 泰玛瓦人问道。",
	"\"Flint\" answered the puppy.": "\"弗林特 \"回答说，小狗。",
	"\"Flint, will you follow me, and learn to be a ranger, and in time, become the Taimavar for this village?\"": "\"弗林特，你愿意跟随我，学习成为一名游侠，并在一段时间内成为这个村庄的泰玛瓦人吗？\"",
	"\"I will\"": "\"我会的\"",
	"Both animals stood, and headed towards the edge of the clearing. Just before they vanished from sight, the larger dog turned and looked  at Thaia.": "两只动物都站了起来，朝空地的边缘走去。就在它们从视线中消失之前，那只较大的狗转过身来，看着泰雅。",
	"\"Thank you Thaia,\" said the Taimavar. \"We will see you both next moon.\"": "\"谢谢你，泰雅。\"泰玛瓦人说。\"我们将在下个月见到你们俩。\"",
	"A gibbous moon hung in the sky, glimpsed occasionally through the thick canopy. The sounds of the day had been replaced by the noises of the night. Snufflings, grunts and the snapping of twigs spoke of a family of boars on one side whilst on the other side the near-silent sweep of wings through the air and the tiny squeaks of unfortunate rodents betrayed the presence of hunting owls.": "一轮弯月挂在天上，透过厚厚的树冠偶尔可以瞥见。白天的声音已经被夜晚的声音所取代。一边是野猪的叫声、呼噜声和树枝的折断声，另一边是翅膀在空中近乎无声的掠过，以及不幸的啮齿动物发出的细微的吱吱声，这都说明了狩猎的猫头鹰的存在。",
	"Noting, but ignoring all this information, Freja padded through the forest, following the trail she had been tracking since early that morning. The small amount of light from the moon helped her eyes little, but that was not the sense she was using. Instead, the forest spoke to her in a million different, tiny ways. The earth through her pads–the damp leaf litter disturbed in the patterns of footprints that didn't belong, the ruffle of breezes in her thick fur telling her of movements on the path far ahead, the droplets of rain containing scents of unwanted intruders. She knew from all of these clues that the party she tracked were goblins, a small number, and that their weary body scents spoke of travel, rather than raiding. Still, she followed, ready.": "注意到，但无视所有这些信息，弗里亚在森林中踱步，沿着她从那天清晨开始追踪的足迹。月亮发出的少量光线对她的眼睛帮助不大，但这不是她使用的感觉。相反，森林以一百万种不同的、微小的方式对她说话。大地穿过她的垫子--潮湿的落叶扰乱了不属于它的脚印图案，微风拂过她厚厚的皮毛，告诉她前面远处道路上的运动，雨滴含有不受欢迎的入侵者的气味。她从所有这些线索中知道，她追踪的队伍是地精，数量不多，他们疲惫的身体气味说明他们在旅行，而不是在抢劫。不过，她还是跟在后面，做好了准备。",
	"Freja paused at a broken branch. With a whisper, she healed it, the shattered fibres knitting back together, and the sap flowing once more. Further on, there was the trace of spoor, where the creatures had defiled the ground underneath a bush. Freja tugged at the thoughts of detritivores, guiding them towards the foul mess, encouraging them to dig in underneath the soil, where it could do some good, rather than pollute the air. Further on, Freja found the remains of a fire, and also of several unfortunate forest creatures that had been the basis of the intruders' meal. She spoke a prayer over the remains, sending their souls towards a better place, and with another word, sent the charred sticks deep into the brush where at least the ashes could fertilise new growth.": "弗雷亚在一根断裂的树枝前停了下来。她低声说了一句话，治愈了它，破碎的纤维重新编织在一起，树液再次流淌。在更远的地方，有残留物的痕迹，这些生物在灌木丛下玷污了地面。芙蕾雅牵动着食腐动物的思绪，引导它们走向那片脏乱的土地，鼓励它们在土壤下面挖掘，在那里它可以做一些好事，而不是污染空气。再往前走，弗里亚发现了一个火堆的残骸，还有几个不幸的森林生物，它们曾是入侵者的食物基础。她在遗体上说了一句祈祷的话，把它们的灵魂送到一个更好的地方，又说了一句话，把烧焦的树枝送到灌木丛深处，至少灰烬可以为新的生长提供肥料。",
	"At last, Freja came upon the goblins, snoring and muttering in sleep. The watch-taker nodded, failing at his task. Freja settled down to watch–she would ensure that these creatures left the forest no more damaged than they had found it, and if necessary, ending their lives before they could do too much harm. As she settled her muzzle on her paws, she became one with the forest, its protector, its child.": "最后，弗里亚来到了地精们的面前，他们在睡梦中打着鼾，喃喃自语。看守人点了点头，他的任务失败了。芙蕾雅安下心来观察--她将确保这些生物离开森林时，不会比他们发现时更多的破坏，如果有必要的话，在他们可能造成太多伤害之前结束他们的生命。当她把嘴放在爪子上时，她与森林融为一体，成为它的保护者，它的孩子。",
	"Hartley shook himself awake from his dream, and eyed the predawn light suspiciously. After a minute he'd satisfied himself that, no, the camp wasn't under attack, it was the dream that had awoken him. It was the same every night - he dreamed of his raven haired mistress, his goddess, the one who both protected him and corrected his mistakes. It was the thought of her that pushed him onwards, protecting the party with his life every day, his dark fur hiding charges from the shadows, his ferocity terrifying even the most hardened of human warriors, the relentlessness of his attacks often turning the tide of battle in favour of his comrades.": "哈特利把自己从梦中摇醒，怀疑地注视着黎明前的光线。一分钟后，他确信，不，营地没有受到攻击，是那个梦把他惊醒了。每天晚上都是这样--他梦见他的乌鸦嘴女主人，他的女神，那个既保护他又纠正他错误的人。正是对她的思念推动着他继续前进，每天用自己的生命保护着党，他的黑毛从阴影中隐藏着指控，他的凶猛甚至让最强硬的人类战士都感到害怕，他无情的攻击常常使战局转向有利于他的同志们。",
	"The thought of his party brought him fully awake, and he crawled out of his bedroll, shrugged into his finely-crafted armour, and trotted off to make his rounds, checking each of the sleeping forms in turn. He carefully sniffed each in turn, alert for the scent of injury, or disease, and reminding himself of their uniqueness. He would lay down his life for each and every one of them.": "一想到他的队伍，他就完全清醒了，他从床单里爬出来，耸耸肩穿上他精心制作的盔甲，小跑着去巡视，依次检查每一个睡着的人。他小心翼翼地依次嗅着每个人，警惕着受伤或疾病的气味，并提醒自己他们的独特之处。他将为他们中的每一个人献出自己的生命。",
	"The dawn watcher, a slightly built halfling thief greeted him cheerily, \"Morning mate! Come for your cuddle?\" Without further warning, the halfling pounced on Hartley, wrestling him to the floor and knuckling his head. Hartley briefly considered biting the halfling's little finger off, to teach him some respect, but instead allowed himself to enjoy the embrace for the smallest of moments before snarling and wriggling away. \"Touch me again, thief, and I will retaliate!\" Hartley gathered his frayed dignity, drawing himself up and thrusting his chin out. \"Where's my breakfast?\" he growled.": "看守黎明的人，一个身材稍胖的半身人盗贼欢快地跟他打招呼：\"早上好，伙计！\"。来抱抱吗？\" 没有进一步的警告，半身人扑向哈特利，把他摔在地上，用手指着他的头。哈特利短暂地考虑过咬掉半身人的小手指，以教给他一些尊重，但在咆哮和扭头离开之前，他允许自己享受这个最小的时刻的拥抱。\"再碰我，小偷，我会报复的！\" 哈特利收起了他破损的尊严，把自己拉起来，把下巴伸出来。\"我的早餐呢？\"他吼道。",
	"A black and white spaniel came into view, humming a jaunty tune, tapping the drum attached to his side with his tail, providing a steady counterpoint as he sauntered along.": "一只黑白相间的小猎犬进入视线，哼着欢快的曲子，用尾巴敲打着贴在身旁的鼓，边走边提供稳定的对音。",
	"The two men facing off with each other couldn't help themselves; they paused in their insults, unconsciously sheathed their daggers, and unwound their combative crouches. It wasn't just that a singing, musical-instrument playing dog was an unheard-of strangeness, it was also that simply hearing the song made them both, just, happier. Slowly, they both turned to face the dog, which sat, still humming, then started to slowly thump its tail on the dusty ground. The men couldn't seem to remember what they had been so worked up about, and even started to recall why they had been friends for so many years - too many, surely, to ruin both their lives with such a pointless skirmish.": "互相对峙的两个人情不自禁；他们在辱骂中停顿下来，不自觉地将匕首出鞘，并松开他们的战斗性蹲姿。这不仅仅是因为一只会唱歌、会演奏乐器的狗是一种闻所未闻的奇怪现象，还因为仅仅是听到这首歌就使他们两个人，只是，更高兴。慢慢地，他们都转过身来面对那条狗，那条狗坐着，仍然哼着歌，然后开始在尘土飞扬的地上慢慢地甩着尾巴。这两个人似乎不记得他们为什么会如此激动，甚至开始回忆他们为什么会成为这么多年的朋友--肯定是太多了，以至于用这种毫无意义的争吵来毁掉他们的生活。",
	"The dog paused it's humming to round off the ditty with a little trio of notes from the pan-pipes round his neck, and the spell was complete. The two men shook hands, wordlessly agreeing to let their disagreement go. The few people in the street that hadn't taken cover inside relaxed, others came out of their hiding places, and the village began to go about it's normal business.": "狗暂停了它的哼唱，用它脖子上的盘管吹出的小三弦来结束这首小曲，咒语就完成了。两个人握了握手，无言地同意让他们的分歧消失。街上少数没有躲在里面的人放松了警惕，其他人也从他们的藏身之处走了出来，村子里的人开始做着正常的事情。",
	"Monty regarded the now-peaceful scene happily. Another fight averted, another two lives–maybe more–improved. It was what Monty lived for, and that was what made him such a brilliant bard.": "蒙蒂高兴地看着现在和平的场景。又避免了一场战斗，又有两条生命--也许更多--得到改善。这就是蒙蒂生活的目的，这也是他成为一名出色的吟游诗人的原因。",
	"The little spaniel ran over to the two men for a fuss, sitting at their feet as they scratched his head and rolling over for a quick tummy rub, before setting off down the road again. Sadly, no biscuits this time, but there was always tomorrow.": "这只小猎犬跑到两个人面前撒娇，坐在他们脚边，看着他们挠它的头，并翻身快速揉肚子，然后再次出发上路。遗憾的是，这次没有饼干，但总会有明天的。",
	"Morgaine walked out of the changing room in her new robes and looked up at her Master. Altaar smiled with pride back at his apprentice. The tailors had been reluctant, resistant even, but had quickly changed their minds when an enormous amount of gold had been placed on the counter. Altaar was used to getting what he wanted, and this day was no exception.": "莫甘娜穿着新袍子走出更衣室，抬头看着她的主人。阿尔塔对他的学徒露出了自豪的笑容。裁缝们本来是不情愿的，甚至是抗拒的，但当一大笔黄金放在柜台上时，他们很快就改变了主意。阿尔泰尔习惯于得到他想要的东西，这一天也不例外。",
	"\"Well, Morgaine, what do you think of your imminent elevation to the Sorcerer's Conclave?": "\"好吧，莫甘娜，你对自己即将被提升为巫师协约国有何看法？",
	"Morgaine considered this for a moment, as she did whenever her Master asked a question–it was not done to give a hasty answer.": "莫甘娜考虑了一会儿，就像她的主人每次问问题时一样--不做草率的回答。",
	"\"Master, I think that although I look the part, and that I have undoubtedly earned your faith in my abilities, convincing the City Conclave will be challenging.\" Although not without any doubt of success, Morgaine privately added, reflecting that ultimately, the Conclave would not dare to refuse her Master–the most powerful Sorcerer that even the rich and ancient City of Keln-Hewe had seen.": "\"主人，我想，虽然我看起来很像，而且我无疑已经赢得了您对我能力的信任，但说服城市协约国将是一个挑战。\" 虽然不是没有成功的把握，但莫甘娜私下补充说，反映出最终，协约国不敢拒绝她的主人--即使是富裕而古老的凯尔恩-赫威城所见过的最强大的巫师。",
	"As Altaar and Morgaine left the Tailor's shop, attracting even more attention now that Morgaine was properly garbed, she reflected on the last few years with, even now, disbelief. She had been an unremarkable member of the Sorcerer's household, although unusually devoted to him, to the point of spending every hour, waking or sleeping, at his side. She had closely observed the practice of his art, the power surging through him, rigorously contained, controlled and channelled. Although she knew not to interfere with his practice, curiosity had overcome her one day, and she had inched forward, and simply sniffed his hand during one of his spells.": "当阿尔泰尔和莫甘娜离开裁缝店时，由于莫甘娜穿戴整齐，吸引了更多人的注意，她回顾了过去几年的情况，即使现在也是难以置信的。她一直是巫师家中一个不起眼的成员，虽然对他异常忠诚，以至于每时每刻都在他身边，无论醒着还是睡着。她仔细观察了他的艺术实践，他身上涌动的力量，被严格控制、控制和引导着。虽然她知道不能干扰他的练习，但有一天好奇心战胜了她，她走到前面，在他的一次施法中简单地嗅了嗅他的手。",
	"It had been as if something huge had awakened inside of her. She remembered yelping with alarm, as intense power had surged through her small body, lifting her off the ground with its raw energy. But, even as it threatened to consume her, she remembered some of the words that her master used, and inexplicably now able to speak them as clearly as him, had brought the chaos under control, slowly returning to the floor, and back to her dumbfounded Master. Morgaine chuckled to herself - this was the only time, before or since, that she'd seen him lost for words as he gathered her into his arms in concern.": "仿佛有什么巨大的东西在她体内苏醒了。她记得自己惊叫起来，因为强烈的力量在她小小的身体里涌动，用它的原始能量把她从地上举起来。但是，即使它有可能吞噬她，她仍然记得她的主人用过的一些话，而且莫名其妙地现在能够像他一样清楚地说出这些话，把混乱控制住了，慢慢地回到地板上，回到她目瞪口呆的主人身边。莫甘娜笑着对自己说--这是唯一一次，不管是以前还是现在，她看到他在关切地把她搂在怀里时不知所措。",
	"After they had both absorbed Morgaine's sudden and unexpected new abilities, training her had been an obvious next move. She had eagerly and quickly progressed, and today was the day they revealed her existence to the Conclave. They approached the elegant stone building, and passed into the imposing foyer. Altaar paused, and knelt down in front of Morgaine, pulling something from his pocket.": "在他们都吸收了莫甘娜突如其来的新能力之后，训练她显然是下一步行动。她热切而迅速地取得了进步，而今天是他们向协约国披露她的存在的日子。他们走近那座优雅的石头建筑，进入气派的门厅。阿尔泰尔停了下来，在莫甘娜面前跪下，从他的口袋里掏出一个东西。",
	"\"I want you to know how proud I am of you, Morgaine.\" He said. And showed her what he held. It was a magnificent jewel, clasped firmly in an ornate gold casing, with a golden chain. He put it around her neck.": "\"我想让你知道我为你感到多么自豪，莫甘娜。\" 他说。并向她展示了他手中的东西。那是一颗华丽的珠宝，被紧紧地扣在一个华丽的金壳里，还有一条金链。他把它戴在她的脖子上。",
	"\"You are my apprentice, soon to be my colleague. And you have earned every right to be here.\"": "\"你是我的学徒，很快将成为我的同事。你已经赢得了来到这里的所有权利。",
	"Morgaine was now the speechless one, as she fought back tears of pride and gratitude. She nodded, and Altaar stood, turned, and led the way into the Conclave's inner Sanctum.": "莫甘娜现在是无言以对，因为她忍住了骄傲和感激的泪水。她点了点头，阿尔泰尔站了起来，转身，带头走进了协约国的内部圣殿。",
	"The sun was bright outside, Nightingale could tell. Golden rays filtered through the fretwork of the window coverings, tiny dust motes dancing in the light illuminating the soft, embroidered pillows and artfully draped silk hangings. Nightingale reclined against her little sofa watching her mistress and master as they laughed and conversed and sipped iced sherbet, or played with the tiny birds with their bright plumage as they sang in their piping voices in their silver cages. Servants slipped in and out, tending to the needs of Nightingale's master and mistress, and her too, as the treasured pet of these two beautiful humans, the young and happy couple. They brought her titbits of lightly roasted meats and delicately peeled fruits, and sometimes her mistress even fed her with her own hands, if Nightingale's tricks - standing on her hind legs and yapping in time to the hidden musicians' tunes - pleased her. At these times, Nightingale was so happy to please her kind mistress, to be so loved, so cared for.": "外面的太阳很亮，南丁格尔可以说。金色的光线透过窗帘的网状结构，细小的尘埃在光线中跳舞，照亮了柔软的刺绣枕头和艺术性的丝绸挂件。南丁格尔斜靠在她的小沙发上，看着她的主人和女主人谈笑风生，喝着冰镇果子露，或者和那些羽毛鲜艳的小鸟玩耍，它们在银色的笼子里用它们的声音唱歌。仆人们进进出出，照顾南丁格尔的主人和女主人的需要，也照顾她，因为她是这两个美丽的人类，这对年轻而幸福的夫妇的珍贵宠物。他们给她送来一点烤得很轻的肉和削得很细的水果，有时她的女主人甚至亲手喂她，如果南丁格尔的小把戏--用后腿站着，随着隐藏的音乐家的曲子叫唤--让她高兴的话。在这些时候，南丁格尔非常高兴能取悦她善良的女主人，得到如此的爱，如此的关怀。",
	"Nightingale opened her eyes, and breathed in deeply, savouring the cool night air of the temple. She repositioned herself slightly on her woven mat, and laid her paws on her bo staff to ground herself.": "夜莺睁开眼睛，深深地吸了一口气，品味着寺庙里清凉的夜风。她在编织的垫子上稍微调整了一下自己的位置，并将爪子放在她的宝杖上，使自己接地。",
	"Now to see things as they had really been.": "现在要看到事情的真实情况。",
	"The sun blazed down on the workers outside in the fields, sapping their strength as they were forced to toil in the heat, to earn a few rations. This wasn't visible, however, through the fretwork in the windows of the prison cell that she and her mistress dwelt in. Their room was decorated with costly fabrics, sewn by half-blind children, draped across bare walls of a room that contained nothing that could be used to do harm to oneself. That pleasure was reserved for their master, who visited in the late afternoon, and usually stayed until late in the evening. At these times, Nightingale's mistress desperately tried to please him, telling stories and dancing to the hidden musicians, and commanding Nightingale to show off the tricks that her mistress tearfully begged her to learn in the early mornings, feeding her the scraps that she'd saved from her own rations. Nightingale's love for her mistress kept her blind to all of this though, until the evening with the shouting, and the screaming, and the final crash. The next morning, Nightingale crept out from under her sofa, shaking and whining, but her mistress would not be awoken.": "太阳炽热地照射着外面田里的工人，在他们被迫在高温下劳作，以赚取一些口粮时，他们的力量被消耗殆尽。然而，通过她和她的女主人所居住的牢房的窗户上的浮雕，这一点并不明显。他们的房间里装饰着昂贵的布料，这些布料是由半盲的孩子们缝制的，挂在房间里光秃秃的墙上，里面没有任何可以用来伤害自己的东西。这种乐趣是留给他们的主人的，他在下午时分来访，通常会待到傍晚时分。在这些时候，南丁格尔的女主人拼命讨好他，给隐蔽的乐师们讲故事、跳舞，并命令南丁格尔展示她的女主人在清晨含泪求她学习的技巧，给她喂她从自己的口粮中省下的残羹剩饭。南丁格尔对女主人的爱使她对这一切视而不见，直到那天晚上的喊叫声、尖叫声和最后的撞击声。第二天早上，南丁格尔从她的沙发下爬出来，颤抖着抱怨，但她的女主人没有被吵醒。",
	"Nightingale opened her eyes once more. She would not relive this night the desperate escape, the weeks of wandering, starving and crying, the arrival at the temple and begging scraps from petitioners with her tricks and her adoption by the monks, slowly learning their ways. She would instead reflect on the morning she awoke at the foot of the huge statue with new thoughts, thoughts that replaced her grief with calm, and a new determination to protect all who were in need of it.": "夜莺再一次睁开了眼睛。她不会在这个夜晚重温绝望的逃亡，几周的流浪，饥饿和哭泣，来到寺庙，用她的伎俩向请愿者乞讨残羹剩饭，以及她被僧侣们收养，慢慢学习他们的方式。相反，她将反思在巨大雕像脚下醒来的那个早晨，她有了新的想法，这些想法用平静取代了她的悲伤，并有了保护所有需要保护的人的新决心。",
	"They used to laugh at Svetlana": "他们曾经嘲笑斯维特拉娜",
	"\"What a big growl for such a tiny puppy!\" They'd said, ruffling her ears and giving her a treat. So she'd run away from her litter as soon as she no longer needed her mother's milk. She had nearly starved learning how to hunt for herself, but the disdain of the crows and rabbits soon turned to fear as she filled her belly night after night, and learned to fight beak and talon with tooth and claw, and to chase down fleeing prey and pounce when the moment was right. But she had no-one with whom to share the joy of the hunt and she was lonely.": "\"这么小的小狗，咆哮声可真大！\" 他们说，揉揉她的耳朵，给她点吃的。所以她一不再需要母亲的奶水，就从她的窝里跑了出来。她几乎饿着肚子学习如何为自己打猎，但乌鸦和兔子的蔑视很快就变成了恐惧，因为她夜夜填饱肚子，并学会了用牙齿和爪子对抗鸟嘴和爪子，追赶逃跑的猎物，在时机成熟时扑上去。但她没有人与她分享狩猎的快乐，她很孤独。",
	"The people of farms and villages had laughed at her when she had come looking for companions.": "当她来寻找同伴时，农场和村庄的人们都嘲笑她。",
	"\"How sweet,\" they'd said, \"come home with us.\" But then they tried to put collar and lead on her. So she'd abandoned farms and villages for the wilds, and learned to find joy in the mountains, sleeping in dug-out hollows in the snow. Her fur became long and thick, and her puppy fat melted away into hard muscle. And somehow along the way she had awoken, and knew her place in the world, but she still wanted a pack.": "\"真好，\"他们说，\"跟我们回家吧。\" 但后来他们试图给她戴上项圈和铅坠。因此，她放弃了农场和村庄，来到荒野，学会了在山上寻找快乐，睡在雪地里挖出的空地上。她的毛发变得又长又厚，她的幼年脂肪融化成坚硬的肌肉。一路走来，她不知不觉地觉醒了，知道了自己在这个世界上的位置，但她仍然想要一个族群。",
	"The Clan had laughed at her when, after stalking them for months, she ventured towards them one day while they hunted.": "当她跟踪他们几个月后，有一天在他们打猎的时候，她冒险走向他们，族人嘲笑她。",
	"\"Go away little soft-paw\" they'd cried, \"Our dogs will eat you!\"": "\"走开，小软爪子\"，他们喊道，\"我们的狗会吃了你！\"",
	"But now she knew not only how to understand them, but to speak in their tongue. When she shouted a challenge to the leader, the large human with wild hair ceased laughing, became silent, and then picked up her weapons. They fought to a standstill, both of them bloodied and torn, panting and regarding each other with respect. Then the Leader offered her hand, and Svetlana placed her paw in it.": "但现在她不仅知道如何理解他们，而且知道如何用他们的语言说话。当她向首领喊出挑战时，这个有着狂野头发的大块头人类停止了笑声，变得沉默，然后拿起了她的武器。他们打得难解难分，两个人都血肉模糊，气喘吁吁，互相尊重。然后领袖伸出了她的手，斯维特拉娜把她的爪子放在里面。",
	"They used to laugh at Svetlana, but not anymore.": "他们曾经嘲笑斯维特拉娜，但现在不会了。",
	"Now she commanded their pack; ferocious, barely tamed wolves twice her size. But the unawakened animals deferred to her instantly, whining and offering their bellies when she came close and moving instantly at her commands in battle.": "现在，她指挥着他们的狼群；凶猛的、几乎没有被驯服的狼群，是她的两倍。但这些未被唤醒的动物立即服从于她，当她走近时，它们会发出呜呜声，献出自己的肚皮，在战斗中，它们会根据她的命令立即行动。",
	"Now she led the hunt equally with the Clan's leader, their bond so close words were rarely needed. Now they raged together, and felt the joy of the wild as one. Now she slept back to back with the Leader, shared equally in the feast, and took her turn on watch. Now she had Clan armour, and Clan weapons made for her.": "现在她和族长一起平等地领导狩猎，他们的关系如此密切，很少需要言语。现在他们一起狂欢，一起感受野外的快乐。现在她和族长背靠背睡觉，平等地分享盛宴，并轮流站岗。现在，她有了族人的盔甲，还有为她制作的族人武器。",
	"Now she had a pack.": "现在她有了一个包。",
	"The steep, cobbled street was dark, except for the light from a guttering lamp, nearly out of oil. A murky dawn smudged the horizon, but it would be dark for a while yet - long enough for Tedric to complete his work. His target lurched out of the shadows, right hand clutched to his stomach round the circular handle of the knife embedded in his guts, blood and other fluids leaking through his shaking fingers.": "陡峭的鹅卵石街道一片漆黑，除了一盏几乎没油的水沟灯发出的光。阴暗的黎明染红了地平线，但天还会黑上一段时间--足够泰德里克完成他的工作。他的目标从阴影中冲了出来，右手紧紧抓住他的肚子，圆圆的刀柄嵌在他的内脏里，血液和其他液体从他颤抖的手指中渗出。",
	"As Tedric had calculated, the man was heading for his gang's thus-far secret hideout. Tedric had wounded him sufficiently to make him think he could make it and survive, and had then melted back into the shadows to follow. Tedric had padded softly behind him all the way, privately exulting in his ability to so closely stalk his prey without detection. It was an innate skill, but diligently refined until he was almost undetectable, even by the keenest of senses. The man paused outside a nondescript door, and reached his hand up to knock. Enough. This was the place. Before the man's hand made contact with the wood, Tedric snatched another dagger from its sheath and launched it. The weapon buried itself in between two ribs and into a lung, silencing any shout the man might make to alert his comrades.": "正如特德里克所计算的那样，这个人正朝着他的团伙迄今为止的秘密藏身处走去。泰德利克把他打伤了，使他认为自己能活下来，然后又消失在阴影中，继续跟踪。泰德里克一路轻轻地跟在他身后，私下里为他能够如此紧密地跟踪猎物而不被发现而感到高兴。这是一种与生俱来的技能，但他一直在努力完善，直到他几乎无法察觉，即使是最敏锐的感官。这个人在一扇不知名的门外停了下来，伸手去敲门。够了。这就是那个地方。在那人的手接触到木头之前，泰德利克从鞘中夺出另一把匕首，并将其发射出去。这把武器埋在两根肋骨之间，刺入肺部，压制了这个人可能发出的提醒他的同志们的任何呼喊。",
	"Tedric finally moved into view, confronting the evil-doer, now slumped against the wall. The man regarded him with disbelief as Tedric walked up his chest, picking his way round the blood. \"but...but...you're just a...\" The whispered words slipped away as Tedric's dagger slid across the man's throat, silencing him forever.": "泰德利克终于进入了人们的视线，面对着那个邪恶的人，他现在瘫软在墙上。当泰德利克走到他的胸前，绕过血迹时，那人难以置信地看着他。\"但是......但是......你只是一个......\" 当泰德利克的匕首滑过那人的喉咙，让他永远沉默时，这句低语就溜走了。",
	"\"I may be just a dog, fiend, but I bested you, and my companions will end your gang's evil deeds for good.\" Tedric carefully retrieved his weapons, grasping the adapted pommels with his mouth, wiping them of blood, and stowing them in their sheaths. The tiny Chihuahua melted back into the dark, slipping away to his party, with the information they needed.": "\"我可能只是一条狗，恶魔，但我打败了你，我的同伴们将会永远结束你这帮人的恶行。\" 泰德利克小心翼翼地取回了他的武器，用嘴抓着适应的鞍座，擦去了血迹，把它们收进了鞘里。小小的吉娃娃融化在黑暗中，带着他们需要的信息，悄悄地溜到他的队伍中。",
	"Despite the upturned chair and displaced pile of books scattered over the floor, Tobias surveyed the scene with satisfaction. Gaining entry to the Wizard's abode had gone exactly according to plan. Tobias had presented himself at the door of the elegant pavilion, having carefully stashed his more obviously warlock garb in a nearby coppice, with one of his spectral companions, a rangy wolf, to guard it. The wizard, an elderly Halfling with white moustaches, had happily let him in, offering him water, and calling him a ‘good boy'. Tobias chuckled at the thought–no-one had called him a good boy in a very long time, and certainly not since his Pact with the Hunter, the unseen claw, the howl in the night.": "尽管椅子被掀翻了，地上散落的书堆也被移开了，但托比亚斯还是满意地打量着这一幕。进入巫师的住所完全是按计划进行的。托拜厄斯在优雅的亭子门口出现，他小心翼翼地把他那件更明显的术士服装藏在附近的灌木丛中，他的一个幽灵同伴，一只奔跑的狼，负责看守它。巫师，一个留着白胡子的老半身人，很高兴地让他进来，给他水喝，并称他为 \"好孩子\"。托拜厄斯一想到这里就笑了起来--已经很久没有人叫他好孩子了，当然，自从他与猎人的契约、那只看不见的爪子、夜里的嚎叫之后，他就再也没有叫过。",
	"That very wizard now huddled on the floor against a bookcase, panting with fear and regarding Tobias with wide eyes, but as yet unharmed. Perfect.": "那个巫师现在蜷缩在地板上，靠着一个书架，恐惧地喘息着，睁大眼睛看着托比亚斯，但还没有受伤。完美。",
	"Tobias rested easily on his haunches, and fixed the Halfling with a steady gaze.": "托比亚斯轻松地靠在椅背上，用稳定的目光注视着这个半身人。",
	"\"Where is the amulet?\" He said, slowly and clearly.": "\"护身符在哪里？\" 他缓慢而清晰地说道。",
	"The wizard stared, then stammered \"you're a... you're a... \"": "巫师瞪大眼睛，然后结结巴巴地说：\"你是一个......你是一个...... \"",
	"Tobias sighed. \"Yes,\" he agreed, soothingly, \"I'm a dog, and I just spoke to you in Common, and asked you,\" Tobias stood up and raised his hackles, speaking just a little more loudly, \"A very simple question.\" He paused for just a beat. \"Where is the amulet?\"": "托比亚斯叹了口气。\"是的，\"他同意了，安抚道，\"我是一只狗，我刚才用普通话和你说话，问你，\"托拜厄斯站起来，扬起他的黑线，说话的声音稍微大了一点，\"一个非常简单的问题。\" 他停顿了一下，只说了一句话。\"护身符在哪里？\"",
	"The wizard actually whimpered, but then incredibly, pulled himself up a bit. \"You have no right to it.\" he stated firmly.": "巫师居然呜咽了一下，但随后不可思议地把自己拉起来了一些。\"你没有权利这样做。\"他坚定地说。",
	"Tobias cursed under his breath. Then shook his head. He was here to achieve his task. He stood up and paced slowly over to the wizard, now beginning to show a little defiance in his posture; the foolish beginnings of resistance. Tobias again fixed him with a glare, and concentrating, issued a Command.": "托比亚斯暗自咒骂道。然后摇了摇头。他在这里是为了完成他的任务。他站了起来，慢慢地踱到巫师面前，现在他的姿势开始显示出一点藐视；愚蠢的反抗的开始。托拜厄斯再次用目光注视着他，并集中精力，发出了一个命令。",
	"\"You will tell me the location of the amulet, fetch it for me, and place it at my feet.\" Tobias felt a familiar warmth spreading from the region of his neck, as his most precious possession, the gift from his Patron, slowly began to weave its spell. He could see the wizard fighting the Command, and he very nearly succeeded, but then he sagged, beaten.": "\"你要告诉我护身符的位置，为我取来，放在我脚边。\" 托拜厄斯感到一种熟悉的温暖从他的脖子上蔓延开来，因为他最珍贵的财产，他的守护神的礼物，慢慢开始编织它的咒语。他可以看到巫师在与命令作斗争，而且他几乎成功了，但随后他垂头丧气，被打败了。",
	"The wizard pushed himself to his feet, moved to a sideboard and shoved it aside. Reaching behind it, he made a movement that Tobias could not see, and a hidden compartment in the bookcase popped open. The wizard wordlessly retrieved an object, turned, and deposited it at Tobias feet.": "巫师推着自己站起来，走到一个边柜前，把它推到一边。他伸手到柜子后面，做了一个托比亚斯看不到的动作，书柜里的一个暗格突然打开了。巫师无言地取出一个东西，转身，把它放在托比亚斯脚下。",
	"Tobias took it up, and without a backward glance, turned and walked away, leaving the wizard to fight off the effects of the Command.": "托拜厄斯拿起它，没有回头看一眼，转身就走了，留下巫师对抗命令的影响。",
	"Back in the coppice, Tobias carefully placed the amulet in a pouch, and shrugged back into his light leather armour, the buckles clipping easily into place with the touch of a paw. He sat and cleared his mind, and then there it was, the taste in his mouth, the feel of the delicious morsel between his jaws. He swallowed and it was gone, but it was enough. His Patron was appeased.": "回到灌木丛中，托比亚斯小心翼翼地把护身符放在一个袋子里，然后耸耸肩穿上他的轻质皮甲，用爪子轻轻一碰，扣子就轻松地扣在了地方。他坐了下来，理清了思路，然后它就出现了，在他嘴里的味道，在他颚间的美味小菜的感觉。他吞了下去，它就不见了，但这已经足够了。他的守护神被安抚了。",
	"The diversity of dogs is hard to generalise but dogs begin with the following traits": "狗的多样性很难一概而论，但狗开始具有以下特征",
	"Dogs have the capacity to make their homes almost anywhere that they choose, but the most common places they are found is within the settlements of other races, acting in a wide range of roles. Wild dogs do also thrive under different circumstances in the more temperate areas of the world. Intelligent dogs tend to remain closely linked with either their adopted society or the wild areas they knew as pups. However, a dog's sense of home is usually defined by their company rather than a place, and dogs are comfortable travelling widely as long as they have the constancy of friendship. ": "狗有能力在它们选择的几乎任何地方安家，但它们最常见的地方是在其他种族的定居点内，扮演着各种各样的角色。在世界较温和的地区，野狗也确实在不同的环境中茁壮成长。聪明的狗往往与它们收养的社会或它们在幼年时熟悉的野生地区保持密切联系。然而，狗的家的感觉通常是由它们的同伴而不是一个地方来定义的，只要有恒久的友谊，狗就能适应广泛的旅行。",
