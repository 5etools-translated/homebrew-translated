	"Despite their multitude of differences from one another, all lera have the following traits in common.": "尽管它们彼此之间有许多不同之处，但所有莱拉都有以下共同特征。",
	"All lera hatch from eggs as larvae about a foot long, and undergo metamorphosis into adolescent lera at age 5. Lera reach adulthood at the age of 10. Truly ancient lera reach the age of 50, but most do not live to be 40.": "所有莱拉从卵中孵化为约一英尺长的幼虫，并在5岁时蜕变为青春期的莱拉。Lera在10岁时达到成年。真正古老的莱拉可以达到50岁，但大多数人活不到40岁。",
	"Most lera abstain from taking a strong moral stance on the world, as it clouds their ability to pursue the secrets that motivate them. As such, lera are typically neutral.": "大多数莱拉不对世界采取强烈的道德立场，因为这影响了他们追求激励他们的秘密的能力。因此，莱拉通常是中立的。",
	"Lera are taller than humans, ranging from 6 to 8 feet tall. Nevertheless, they are exceptionally light, weighing only 150 to 200 pounds. You are size Medium.": "莱拉比人类高，身高在6至8英尺之间。尽管如此，他们还是特别轻，体重只有150到200磅。你是中等身材。",
	"Your base walking speed is 30 feet.": "你的基本行走速度是30英尺。",
	"You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor. When using your flying speed from this source, you cannot end your turn more than 5 feet above a solid surface, and gently descend down to this distance at a speed of 60 feet per round if you are any higher, taking no damage from falling. At 5th level, this distance increases to 10 feet above a surface. At 11th level, you can end your turn at any height without limitation.": "你有一个30英尺的飞行速度。要使用这个速度，你不能穿着中型或重型盔甲。当从这个来源使用你的飞行速度时，你不能在距离固体表面5英尺以上的地方结束你的回合，如果你在更高的地方，你会以每回合60英尺的速度缓缓下降到这个距离，不会因为下降而受到伤害。在5级时，这个距离增加到离地面10英尺。在11级时，你可以在任何高度无限制地结束你的回合。",
	"You cannot naturally speak louder than a whisper. The sound of your voice normally carries no further than 30 feet.": "你说话的声音自然不能超过耳语。你的声音通常不会超过30英尺。",
	"You know the exact location of any creature or object within 5 feet of you, even if you are blinded or the creature or object is invisible.": "你知道在你5英尺范围内的任何生物或物体的确切位置，即使你被蒙蔽或该生物或物体不可见。",
	"You are naturally nocturnal, and have excellent vision in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "你是天生的夜行者，在黑暗中拥有出色的视力。你可以在你周围120英尺内的昏暗光线中看到，就像亮光一样，而在黑暗中就像暗光一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.": "当你、你的攻击目标或你试图感知的东西处于阳光直射下时，你在攻击卷和依靠视觉的智慧（感知）检查上有劣势。",
	"You can speak, read, and write both Common and Lera. The Lera language is equal parts sound and motion, and the position and direction of one's wings, feelers, head, and arms are just as important as the words that are spoken. In written form, Lera is a series of vaguely runic spirals and curls that are traditionally scribed with a lightly-glowing ink, made in part from a lera's own dust.": "你可以说、读、写普通话和莱拉语。莱拉语是声音和动作并重的语言，一个人的翅膀、感觉器、头和手臂的位置和方向与所说的语言一样重要。在书面形式上，莱拉语是一系列模糊的符文螺旋和卷曲，传统上是用淡淡发光的墨水涂抹，部分由莱拉自己的灰尘制成。",
	"Unstirred by countless ages, the dark and dust find their eternal silence punctuated by an errant, erratic scratching. Stifled footfalls as soft as snow make their way through the forgotten corridors, the scratching producing faint echoes as it trails alongside them. Light splits the darkness, pouring from a small lantern on a staff, bound to the back of a tall yet delicate humanoid. Swathed in ruffs of fur, emanating a small cloud ofparticulate with each step, the figure's compound, insectoid eyes remain locked slightly downward, regarding a book and quill she holds in either hand.": "在无数岁月的洗礼下，黑暗和尘埃发现它们永恒的寂静被一种飘忽不定的抓挠声所打断。像雪一样柔软的窒息的脚步声穿过被遗忘的走廊，抓挠声在他们身边产生微弱的回声。光线劈开了黑暗，从杖上的一个小灯笼里倾泻而出，被绑在一个高大而精致的人形物体的背上。她披着毛皮，每走一步都会散发出一小团微粒，她那双复式的、昆虫般的眼睛仍然微微向下锁着，看着她两手拿着的一本书和羽毛笔。",
	"\"Tower contains only faint trace of magic,\" she whispers, nearly subvocally, as the quill scratches paper, \"Most artifacts pilfered with fall of magocracy, little clue to causes.\"": "\"塔中只有微弱的魔法痕迹，\"她低声说，几乎是潜意识的，因为鹅毛笔在纸上划过。\"大多数文物都是随着魔族的衰落而被偷走的，没有什么线索可以说明原因。\"",
	"Her footsteps suddenly stop, and her eyes raiseforward, sparkling with the lantern light. Looking tothe stonework at her side, she regards several large, knife-sized gouges raking through the crumbling edifice. Glancing then down past her writings, her eyes settle on the remains of a human skull, half-buried in the dust, adjacent to a dark stain upon the stones.": "她的脚步突然停了下来，她的眼睛朝前看，在灯笼的光线下闪闪发光。她看了看身旁的石雕，发现有几条大的、刀子般大小的沟壑在摇摇欲坠的建筑中穿行。然后，她往下看了一眼她的著作，她的目光落在一个人类头骨的残骸上，它半埋在灰尘中，与石头上的一个黑点相邻。",
	"\"Signs of struggle,\" she continues, \"Magical adversary. Summoning? Territorial? Aberrant, fey, or fiend likely.\"": "\"斗争的迹象，\"她继续说，\"神奇的对手。召唤？领土？可能是异教徒、妖怪或魔人。\"",
	"Shutting the book and placing it and the quill in a satchel at her side, she reaches for her staff, swinging its leather strap over her long antennae and diaphanous wings as she grasps it in both of her clawed hands. Lifting it aloft, the lantern swaying above her head, she brings it down with brutal force, shattering the human skull and sending a resounding clamor sweeping through the halls.": "合上书，把它和鹅毛笔放在身边的书包里，她伸手去拿她的法杖，当她用两只带爪的手抓住法杖时，在她长长的触角和透明的翅膀上摆动法杖的皮带。把它高高举起，灯笼在她头顶上摇摆，她用残酷的力量把它打下来，打碎了人的头骨，发出响亮的喧哗声，席卷整个大厅。",
	"She stands still, holding the staff directly in front of her. The only sounds to be heard are the trailing echo, and the slight groan of the lantern's cord as it sweeps aimlessly back and forth. Somewhere unfathomably deep below, a distant roar bellows in response, trickling back upwards across the stonework. Following it, a stream of obscene eldritch syllables, diluted into incomprehensible rage as it travels the halls. Then, footsteps: thunderous but dampened, and yet approaching.": "她静静地站着，把法杖放在她的正前方。唯一能听到的声音是拖曳的回声，以及灯笼线漫无目的地来回扫动时发出的轻微呻吟。在下面某个深不可测的地方，一个遥远的咆哮声响起，在石板上往回淌。紧随其后的是一串淫秽的长篇音节，在大厅里穿梭时被稀释成难以理解的怒火。然后，是脚步声：雷鸣般的声音，但被抑制住了，但又在接近。",
	"Calmly, the figure slips her staff once more onto her back, and retrieves her book and quill.": "平静地，这个人物再次将她的法杖滑到她的背上，并取回她的书和羽毛笔。",
	"\"Fiendish,\" she begins reading as she writes, \"Infernal. Can be reasoned with. Will have valuable knowledge of this place. Likely aggressive.\"": "\"恶魔，\"她开始边写边读，\"无间道。可以与之讲道理。将对这个地方有宝贵的知识。可能有攻击性。\"",
	"Though she continues onward, her direction takes a sharp turn, making straight for the ominous clatter in the distance. \"Barter possible, not probable. Violence expected,\" she pens, as her lantern light shines forward through the antediluvian passages. Knowledge itself has value, and none know this better than the lera. Seekers of the forbidden and the forgotten, lera search after mysteries others fear, drawn inexorably by the lure of personal enlightenment.": "虽然她继续前进，但她的方向却急转直下，直奔远处的不祥之音。\"交易是可能的，不可能的。她写道，当她的灯笼光穿过前代的通道向前照射时。知识本身是有价值的，没有人比莱拉人更清楚这一点。lera是禁忌和被遗忘的探索者，她寻找别人害怕的神秘，被个人启蒙的诱惑所吸引，不可自拔。",
	"Ever-elusive, the lera are a race of silent wanderers, always looking for mysteries both mystical and mundane. Imposing yet profoundly soft-spoken, the average lera is anywhere from 6-8 feet tall, and talks only in faint whispers.": "永远难以捉摸，莱拉人是一个沉默的流浪者的种族，总是在寻找神秘和世俗的秘密。印象深刻而又轻声细语的莱拉，平均身高在6-8英尺之间，只用微弱的低语交谈。",
	"A lera is covered in a strange, soft, dusty fur that can be a wide variety of colorations, from dusky white, black and grey to vibrant orange, red, yellow, purple, blue, or pink. Lera have delicate wings, and sometimescarry striking patterns across their wings and backevoking snowfall, a sunset, enormous eyes, a death's head, or similar.": "莱拉被一种奇怪的、柔软的、布满灰尘的皮毛所覆盖，其颜色多种多样，从昏暗的白色、黑色和灰色到充满活力的橙色、红色、黄色、紫色、蓝色或粉红色。莱拉有精致的翅膀，有时会在翅膀和背部带着引人注目的图案，让人联想到降雪、日落、巨大的眼睛、死亡的头颅或类似的东西。",
	"Lera also have multifaceted, insectoid eyes that come in many different hues, such as purple, black, white green, red, or grey. Atop a lera's head are a pair of long, lightly-tasseled antennae, which range from 1 foot to 3 feet long and waver in response to stimuli. A lera has adistinctly non-humanoid mouth, consisting of mandibles and a curled, hidden proboscis, used to pull in solid food and consume liquids respectively. Lera have no nose to speak of, and instead have scent receptors distributed throughout their antennae and mouth parts, allowing them to feel smells, rather than taste them.": "莱拉也有多面的、昆虫般的眼睛，有许多不同的色调，如紫色、黑色、白绿色、红色或灰色。在莱拉的头顶上有一对长长的、有轻度流苏的触角，长度从1英尺到3英尺不等，对刺激的反应是摆动的。莱拉有明显的非人类的嘴，由下颌骨和一个弯曲的、隐藏的探针组成，分别用来拉动固体食物和消耗液体。莱拉没有鼻子，而是在其触角和嘴部分布有气味受体，使它们能够感觉到气味，而不是品尝它们。",
	"The strange facial anatomy of the lera makes understanding their emotions difficult for those not accustomed to their presence, complicated by the lack of intonation in a lera's speaking voice. Among those they trust, the lera will often state the emotional content of their communications outright: \"This makes me feel uncomfortable,\" or \"I am overjoyed at your presence,\" as examples. Among those they don't know, however, the lera are satisfied to leave them guessing.": "lera奇怪的面部解剖结构使得那些不习惯他们存在的人很难理解他们的情绪，而lera说话的声音中缺乏音调，这使得情况更加复杂。在他们信任的人中，Lera经常会直截了当地说出他们交流的情感内容：\"这让我感到不舒服，\"或 \"我对你的出现感到非常高兴，\"就是例子。然而，在那些他们不认识的人中，Lera会满意地让他们猜测。",
	"Lera are instinctively drawn towards knowledge, secrets, and power with a compulsion that is hard to articulate to members of other races. Many lera hunger after complex matters of arcana and artifice, while others comb the hidden dogma of forgotten gods for insights lost to time. Some lera take this compulsion as a reason to perpetually acquire that which is not theirs, though most respect the rules of ownership.": "莱拉人本能地被知识、秘密和权力所吸引，这种强迫性是其他种族的成员难以表达的。许多莱拉渴望了解复杂的奥术和工匠精神，而另一些人则在被遗忘的神灵的隐秘教条中寻找被时间遗忘的见解。一些莱拉人把这种强迫性作为一个理由，不断地获取不属于他们的东西，尽管大多数人尊重所有权的规则。",
	"Light and flame carry a great symbolic importance in lera culture, representing the brilliance of enlightenment that all lera seek. It is usual for lera to be captivated by a great and beautiful source of radiant light, though putting this captivation into words that othersnwill understand is next to impossible for any lera.": "光和火焰在莱拉文化中具有重要的象征意义，代表了所有莱拉人所追求的启蒙的光辉。对莱拉来说，被巨大而美丽的光芒所吸引是很正常的，尽管对任何莱拉来说，把这种迷恋转化为别人能理解的语言是几乎不可能的。",
	"In lera society, the secrets one collects are the truest currency, holding far more value than coin ever could. Lera meet in moonlit forests or in darkened caves to broker with one another, and occasionally outsiders.": "在莱拉社会，一个人收集的秘密是最真实的货币，其价值远远超过硬币的价值。莱拉人在月光下的森林或黑暗的山洞中聚会，彼此之间进行交易，偶尔也有外来者。",
	"Lera usually take great pains to be truthful with their words, as their secrets only have value if they can be believed. Though they meet often, lera seldom form large cities, but occasionally live in the cities of other races, or create small cloisters of their own.": "莱拉人通常很努力地做到言之有物，因为他们的秘密只有在被相信时才有价值。虽然他们经常见面，但莱拉人很少形成大的城市，而是偶尔住在其他种族的城市里，或者建立自己的小回廊。",
	"Before death, it is traditional for a lera to give all of its accumulated secrets freely to another that it trusts. Some lera keep a hidden tome full of their knowledge, locked or with instructions for it to be opened only after their demise. Still, some secrets a lera will take to the grave, especially those that would harm others the lera cares about.": "在死亡之前，传统上，莱拉会将其积累的所有秘密免费提供给它信任的另一个人。有些莱拉把他们的知识保存在一个隐藏的小册子里，上了锁，或者说明只有在他们死后才会打开。尽管如此，有些秘密还是会被莱拉带进坟墓，特别是那些会伤害莱拉所关心的人的秘密。",
	"All lera have a true name and a use-name, the first of which is the most guarded of secrets, the second of which is handed out as if it were the lera's true identity.": "所有的莱拉都有一个真实的名字和一个使用的名字，第一个名字是最保守的秘密，第二个名字就像莱拉的真实身份一样被传出去。",
	"In lera courtship, the exchange of true names is equivalent to a marriage vow, the trusting of another lera to hold and keep hidden something known to no other.": "在莱拉的求爱过程中，交换真名相当于婚姻的誓言，信任另一个莱拉持有并隐藏一些不为他人所知的东西。",
	"Neither lera use-names or true names are gendered, as lera society has few cultural distinctions along gender lines, though sometimes they pick up such distinctions from other cultures they come into contact with.": "莱拉人的用名和真名都没有性别区分，因为莱拉社会几乎没有性别方面的文化区分，尽管有时他们会从接触到的其他文化中获得这种区分。",
	"Examples of true names and use-names can be seen below:": "真实名称和使用名称的例子见下文。",
	"Andar, Byx, Cinth, Eron, Fyaril, Lepi, Lossa, Nia, Phym, Reen, Rippi, Sifp, Soris, Thera, Uteth": "Andar, Byx, Cinth, Eron, Fyaril, Lepi, Lossa, Nia, Phym, Reen, Rippi, Sifp, Soris, Thera, Uteth",
	"Alabaster, Calling, Dawnglow, Duskember, Gossamer, Lightlinger, Memory, Moondust, Nightmusic, Sighted, Silence, Silk, Whisper": "青石板, 召唤, 曙光, 黄昏, 格萨默, 光线, 记忆, 月尘, 夜间音乐, 视力, 沉默, 丝绸, 低语",
	"Lera are instinctively attracted to light. At your DM's option, you can add the following trait to illustrate this compulsion.": "莱拉本能地被光吸引。根据你的DM的选择，你可以添加以下特征来说明这种强迫性。",
	"If you start your turn in an area of dim light or darkness and there is a source of bright light you can see within 120 feet of you, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 15–half your total character level. Failing this saving throw means you cannot willingly move any further away from that source of light during your turn, and you repeat this saving throw at the start of each of your turns. Success on this saving throw means you are unaffected by this trait for the next hour. Light sources on your person or that you are holding do not trigger a saving throw with this trait.": "如果你在一个昏暗的光线或黑暗的区域开始你的回合，并且在你周围120英尺内有一个你能看到的亮光源，你必须用智慧救赎，其DC为15-你的总角色等级的一半。这个自救动作失败意味着你在你的回合中不能自愿地远离那个光源，并且你在每个回合开始时重复这个自救动作。蓄力成功意味着你在接下来的一小时内不会受到这种特性的影响。你身上的光源或你拿着的光源不会触发这个特质的蓄力一击。",
	"Depending on the nature of the game being played, sunlight sensitivity can be a minor inconvenience, or a crippling flaw": "根据所玩游戏的性质，阳光敏感度可能是一个小的不便，也可能是一个残缺的缺陷。",
	"If your DM believes that the Sunlight Sensitivity trait would be too hindering for your character, they can allow you to remove it. If you do, reduce the distance of your {@sense darkvision} to 60 feet. This functions similarly to the Diurnal trait on the chrysir subrace, which should also be removed if you use this option.": "如果你的DM认为阳光敏感的特质对你的角色来说太碍事，他们可以允许你去掉它。如果你这样做，将你的（%0%）的距离减少到60英尺。这与克里尔亚族的昼伏夜出特性的功能相似，如果你使用这个选项，也应该将其移除。",
	"Additionally, you can use an action to sweep your wings dramatically, giving off a thick cloud of particulate. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus, or become {@condition blinded} until the end of your next turn. You can then move up to twice your speed, as if you used the {@action dash|phb|dash action}. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.": "此外，你可以使用一个动作，大幅度地扫动你的翅膀，散发出厚厚的微粒云。在你5英尺范围内的每个生物都必须成功地进行一次体质救赎，对抗DC为8+你的体质修正值+你的熟练度加成，否则就会变成{@condition blinded}，直到你下一回合结束。然后你可以移动到你速度的两倍，就像你使用了（%1%）一样。一旦你使用这个能力，你必须完成一个短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",
	"Though all lera use pheromones to interface with others of their kind, yours are especially potent. You learn the {@spell friends} cantrip. You also learn the {@spell charm person} and {@spell calm emotions} spells, each of which you can cast once at their lowest possible spell level without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.": "虽然所有的莱拉都使用费洛蒙来与其他同类进行交流，但你的费洛蒙特别有效。你学会了{@spell friends}的咒语。你还学会了{@spell charm person}和{@spell calm emotions}的法术，每一个法术你都可以在其最低的法术等级下施放一次，而不需要消耗一个法术槽。当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得以这种方式施放这两个法术的能力。魅力是你对所有三种法术的施法能力。",
	"The goblera knows the exact location of any creature or object within 5 feet, even if the goblera is {@condition blinded} or the creature or object is {@condition invisible}.": "哥布林知道5英尺内任何生物或物体的确切位置，即使哥布林是{@condition blinded}或生物或物体是{@condition invisible}。",
	"The goblera can take the {@action Disengage} or {@action Hide} action as a bonus action on each of its turns.": "戈布雷拉可以在它的每个回合中采取{@action Disengage}或{@action Hide}的行动作为额外行动。",
	"While in sunlight, the goblera has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.": "当在阳光下时，哥布莱拉在攻击卷上有劣势，在依靠视觉的智慧（（%0%））检查上也是如此。",
	"{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 5}击中，到达5英尺，一个目标。{@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3})砍击伤害。",
	"In ages past, an unscrupulous {@race Lera (Tysani)|Lera|tysani lera} desired minions for their nefarious ends, which mostly involved the pilfering of spells and magical artifacts from the denizens of the Underdark. {@creature goblin|mm|Goblins} were an obvious choice, found in abundance, but the tysani believed them to be flawed and attempted to improve on their design. These efforts culminated in the creation of the goblera, a strange race that blends goblin and lera seamlessly into miniature, long-limbed moth-like creatures with glowing red eyes and ruffs of fur in any coloration found on lera.": "在过去的岁月里，一个不择手段的{@race Lera (Tysani)|Lera|tysani lera}为了他们邪恶的目的而需要奴仆，这主要涉及从地下城的居民那里偷取法术和魔法文物。(1%)是一个明显的选择，它被大量发现，但泰萨尼认为它们有缺陷，并试图改进它们的设计。这些努力最终导致了哥布莱拉的诞生，这是一个奇怪的种族，它将哥布莱拉和莱拉完美地融合在一起，成为微型的、长肢飞蛾般的生物，拥有发光的红眼睛和莱拉身上任何颜色的毛皮围脖。",
	"Goblera ambush unsuspecting creatures under cover of darkness, and are driven by the worst aspects of both lera and goblin nature to collect and hoard what is not theirs in large hidden treasure troves. The greater something's perceived worth, the more a goblera must have it, throwing personal safety to the winds for the chance to acquire treasure. Goblera often find themselves working as minions for the sinister movers and shakers of the Underdark, such as mind flayers, drow, fomorians, or even lera. Goblins view goblera as abominations and slay them on sight.": "妖精在黑暗的掩护下伏击毫无戒心的生物，并在莱拉和妖精天性中最坏的方面的驱使下，收集和囤积不属于他们的东西在大型的隐藏宝库里。某样东西的价值越大，妖精就越要得到它，为了获得宝藏的机会，他们会把个人安全抛到九霄云外。哥布莱拉经常发现自己在为暗黑世界阴险的行动者和摇摆者工作，比如说心魔、乌鸦、福摩瑞安，甚至是莱拉。哥布林认为哥布林是可憎的，一见到他们就会被杀死。",
	"Goblera occasionally live in clusterings of their own, mirroring a goblin warren or a lera cloister. In these societies, the goblera with the most material wealth is a nominal ruler, and usually acts as a tyrant with no motive other than continuing to increase its treasure trove": "妖精偶尔会生活在自己的集群中，就像妖精的巢穴或莱拉的回廊。在这些社会中，拥有最多物质财富的地精是一个名义上的统治者，通常作为一个暴君，除了继续增加其宝库外，没有其他动机。",
	"The lera's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save {@dc 12}, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The lera can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:": "lera的法术能力是智力（法术保存（%0%），法术攻击的命中率+4）。lera可以天生施展以下法术，不需要任何材料成分。",
	"The lera knows the exact location of any creature or object within 5 feet, even if the lera is {@condition blinded} or the creature or object is {@condition invisible}.": "lera知道5英尺内任何生物或物体的确切位置，即使lera是{@condition blinded}或生物或物体是{@condition invisible}。",

	"{@atk mw,rw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) piercing damage in melee, or 6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) damage at range.": "{@atk mw,rw}{@hit 6}击中，到达5英尺或范围20/60英尺，一个目标。{@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4})的近战穿刺伤害，或6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4})的范围伤害。",
	"The most common type of lera for other races to meet, lera scholars mostly keep to themselves except when endeavoring to learn something new.

	"Some lera are not opposed to taking what is not theirs, and stalk the empty nights looking for those that can be parted from their goods.

As a sign of this bargain, each achrae has a pale skull pattern on the fur just behind its head, up against the back of its neck.

These lera are brash and adventurous, prone to taking risks and ignoring consequences. Reveling in daylight, the chrysir have gained much of its magical power as their own, capable of bending illumination to their own ends.

Unlike other lera, curin have powerful teeth hidden behind their mouthparts in place of their proboscis, and a ravenous hunger for meat. Lera scholars have determined this unnatural state of being came to pass due to consorting with demonic entities, brokering for knowledge and power that should have been left well alone.
