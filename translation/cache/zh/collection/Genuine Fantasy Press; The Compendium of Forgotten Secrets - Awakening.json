Countless thousands died that day, and those that remained lived among the corpses and the surf amidst the highest mountaintops. Over time, the Keeper's unshakable influence over the world grew ever greater, twisting once noble folk into imitations of themselves. They performed rituals over the dead, taking the flesh of their fallen and consuming it themselves. They offered their broken bodies and minds to the Keeper, and it grew ever more powerful.": "这些恐怖的东西被怀疑是作为守护者第一次收集的结果而产生的：在一个遥远的世界上被潮水淹没的文明的废墟中发现了一系列古代文物。有了这些东西，它号召海洋上升到陆地之上，并吞噬了整个星球，尽管这些文物在这个过程中被摧毁了。无数人在那一天死去，而剩下的人则生活在尸体和最高山顶的海浪中。随着时间的推移，守护者对世界不可动摇的影响越来越大，将曾经高贵的人们扭曲成自己的模仿者。他们在死者身上举行仪式，取走死者的肉，然后自己食用。他们将自己破碎的身体和思想献给守护者，而守护者也变得越来越强大。",

	"The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang.

They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe. Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment.

When at rest, they scuttle along at a slow pace, finding a nook in some stone to lie in on a side that is exposed to the wind and elements. They enjoy gifts of meat and perfumes, and chirp excitedly when they are carried around. At night, colonies of spark seekers perform elaborate mating dances, lighting up the sky with flashes of lightning and strong gusts of wind. An entire colony of them working in concert can start a summon a massive and terrible storm, making them dangerous when near civilized areas.": "火花探寻者是一种小型的、类似鳐鱼的生物，漂浮在风中，利用风进行防御。火花探寻者曾经是爬在风暴之主皮毛上的寄生虫，他们被这位神一样的存在的传奇力量所触动，成长和改变，获得了挥舞魔法能量的能力，以换取对神的服务。当受到威胁时，他们通过压缩周围空气中的尘埃来制作水晶碎片，并在给它充电后向目标发射。休息时，它们以缓慢的速度前进，在一些石头上找到一个角落，躺在暴露在风和元素中的一面。它们喜欢肉和香水的礼物，当它们被抱来抱去时兴奋地鸣叫。到了晚上，寻求火花的群体会表演精心制作的交配舞蹈，用闪电和强风照亮天空。它们的整个群落协同工作，可以引发一场巨大而可怕的风暴，使它们在文明地区附近变得危险。",
	"Summoning one is simple: light the brazier, chant the proper words and praises to the Lord of Storms, extinguish the brazier with water, and then your desired spark seeker will appear from within the resulting fog and steam.": "召唤一个人很简单：点燃火炉，向风暴之神念叨适当的话语和赞美，用水熄灭火炉，然后你想要的火花寻求者会从产生的雾气和蒸汽中出现。",
	"Whenever more than 10 spark seekers are together, they can act as a single unit to form a spark seeker swarm. Add their total hit points together to determine the total hit points of the swarm. For every 5 spark seekers that the swarm starts with, it can make one additional spikeshard attack during its turn without using an action.": "每当10个以上的火花寻觅者在一起时，他们可以作为一个单位形成一个火花寻觅者群。将它们的总命中率加在一起，就可以确定火种群的总命中率。火花机群开始时每有5个火花机，它就可以在其回合内进行一次额外的尖刺攻击而不需要使用行动。",

Once a spark seeker has participated in a swarm that has cast this spell, it can't contribute to a new casting for one month.": "每当同一群火花爱好者超过100人时，这群火花爱好者就可以施展复仇风暴，只不过酸雨被替换成了冰冻雨，从而造成寒冷伤害。当以这种方式施放时，这个法术的蓄力DC是20。火花群中的所有火花寻求者都对这个法术的效果免疫。一旦火种寻求者参与了施放此法术的火种群，它在一个月内不能再参与新的施法。",

	"The symphonic songbird is a colorful avian creature that mimics the voices of others, and can produce a beautiful melody fit for any occasion. They seem to originate from birds that have fallen for the allure of the Perfect Chord and have been touched by the magical emanations that constantly flow from it. Infused with choral power, they speak and sing with the voices of any sounds they have heard. Oddly enough, they seem to prefer being exposed to a constant onslaught of sound when at rest, and will seek out the noisiest place around to build their nests.": "交响曲鸟是一种丰富多彩的鸟类生物，可以模仿他人的声音，并能产生适合任何场合的优美旋律。它们似乎起源于那些为完美和弦的诱惑所倾倒的鸟类，并被从它那里不断流出的神奇的散发所触动。它们注入了合唱的力量，用它们听到的任何声音来说话和唱歌。奇怪的是，它们在休息时似乎更喜欢暴露在持续不断的声音冲击下，并会寻找周围最嘈杂的地方筑巢。",
	"Colonies of songbirds will form full orchestral symphonies, to the delight of the rare few who are granted an audience. When threatened, they dazzle and strike with wicked beaks, inspiring one another to fight with fervor and fury against all aggressors. They enjoy gifts of fruit and shiny objects, which they use to build elaborate nests. Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. Summoning a symphonic songbird involves singing, as one might expect. The brazier is lit, the incense is burned, and the summoner must begin a melody of their own creation. It must be carefully done, so that there is room for another to harmonize without interruption or disruption, and is often difficult for novices. Once the song reaches the correct moment, the fire within the brazier will coalesce into the image of a songbird, and it will begin to sing along with its new master. The summoner must continue their song to an appropriate closing, guiding the bird out from the brazier at the same time. Once it has emerged fully and is corporeal, the warlock must end the song and speak their name. The symphonic songbird will repeat the name perfectly, and then speak its own. When the warlock does the same and speaks the songbird's name in exact mimicry, the bond between familiar and master will be formed.": "成群的鸣禽会组成完整的交响乐，让极少数获得听众的人高兴。当受到威胁时，它们会耀武扬威，用邪恶的喙进行攻击，互相激励，对所有侵略者进行狂热的战斗。它们喜欢水果和闪亮的东西作为礼物，用它们来建造精致的巢穴。然而，它们的歌声是引导旅行者误入歧途的传奇，在文明程度较低的地方，人们往往对它们抱有不信任和怀疑的态度。召唤交响曲鸟需要唱歌，正如人们所期望的那样。炉子被点燃，香被烧掉，召唤者必须开始唱他们自己创造的旋律。这必须小心翼翼地进行，以便有空间让另一个人在不被打断或干扰的情况下进行和声，这对新手来说往往是困难的。一旦歌声达到正确的时刻，火炉内的火就会凝聚成一只鸣禽的形象，它将开始与它的新主人一起唱歌。召唤者必须将他们的歌声持续到适当的结束，同时引导鸟儿从火炉中出来。一旦它完全出现并且有了肉体，术士必须结束歌声并说出自己的名字。交响曲鸟会完美地重复这个名字，然后说出自己的名字。当术士也这样做，并以完全模仿的方式说出鸣禽的名字时，熟悉的人和主人之间的联系就会形成。",

	"A deadly thing that lurks in the pockets of countless saints and villains alike, money is a tool that brings both salvation and misery. Not all funds can be trusted, however. The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.": "钱是一种致命的东西，潜伏在无数圣人和恶棍的口袋里，是一种既能带来救赎又能带来痛苦的工具。然而，并不是所有的资金都可以信任。货币阴谋已经逐渐用Karensee取代了世界上的原始货币，俗称为财富模仿品。它们可以采取无穷无尽的形式，但它们受到限制，不像它们较大的亲属。这些模仿者只能选择变成那些看起来有价值的物体。一枚金币、一张钞票、一块宝石、一串珍珠项链：所有这些东西都是潜在的财富模仿者。它们中的大多数都在沉睡，被困在一个单一的形式中。它们在沉睡时佯装损坏或其他不良影响，表现得与自然材料完全一样。然而，当它们被长生魔法唤醒时，它们就会活过来，攻击那些试图拥有它们的人。货币阴谋的成员经常使用一种仪式召唤并唤醒财富模仿者，但任何有足够力量和知识的术士都可以召唤一个。",
	"The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.": "第一步相对容易。召唤者必须点燃火炉，并站在火炉旁边，念出正确的咒语。一旦火被烧成灰烬，召唤者必须插入一个财富模仿者可以模仿的单一价值物品，如硬币或纸币。",
	"Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.": "接下来，术士必须提供血液。当几滴血滴在火炉内的物体上时，火焰将再次燃烧起来，吞噬物体，然后消失。灰烬将开始形成一个与物体相同的形状，一个新的财富模仿体将诞生。它将说一个词，给自己一个名字。只要它的主人知道这个名字，它就会完全服从，改变形状并按命令杀人。",
	"Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach.": "财富模仿者喜欢被喂食其他货币。一些学者低声说这是为了给他们权力，但其他人怀疑他们只是天生吃人。阴谋中的人被认为在创造财富模仿者时有一个内置的安全措施，以防最终计划出错。在这种情况下，他们会在被剥夺了其他肉体后疯狂地吞噬彼此，使他们对那些他们无法接触到的人无害。",
