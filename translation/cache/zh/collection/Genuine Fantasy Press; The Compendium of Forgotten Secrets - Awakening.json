Countless thousands died that day, and those that remained lived among the corpses and the surf amidst the highest mountaintops. Over time, the Keeper's unshakable influence over the world grew ever greater, twisting once noble folk into imitations of themselves. They performed rituals over the dead, taking the flesh of their fallen and consuming it themselves. They offered their broken bodies and minds to the Keeper, and it grew ever more powerful.": "这些恐怖的东西被怀疑是作为守护者第一次收集的结果而产生的：在一个遥远的世界上被潮水淹没的文明的废墟中发现了一系列古代文物。有了这些东西，它号召海洋上升到陆地之上，并吞噬了整个星球，尽管这些文物在这个过程中被摧毁了。无数人在那一天死去，而剩下的人则生活在尸体和最高山顶的海浪中。随着时间的推移，守护者对世界不可动摇的影响越来越大，将曾经高贵的人们扭曲成自己的模仿者。他们在死者身上举行仪式，取走死者的肉，然后自己食用。他们将自己破碎的身体和思想献给守护者，而守护者也变得越来越强大。",

	"The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang.

They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe. Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment.

When at rest, they scuttle along at a slow pace, finding a nook in some stone to lie in on a side that is exposed to the wind and elements. They enjoy gifts of meat and perfumes, and chirp excitedly when they are carried around. At night, colonies of spark seekers perform elaborate mating dances, lighting up the sky with flashes of lightning and strong gusts of wind. An entire colony of them working in concert can start a summon a massive and terrible storm, making them dangerous when near civilized areas.": "火花探寻者是一种小型的、类似鳐鱼的生物，漂浮在风中，利用风进行防御。火花探寻者曾经是爬在风暴之主皮毛上的寄生虫，他们被这位神一样的存在的传奇力量所触动，成长和改变，获得了挥舞魔法能量的能力，以换取对神的服务。当受到威胁时，他们通过压缩周围空气中的尘埃来制作水晶碎片，并在给它充电后向目标发射。休息时，它们以缓慢的速度前进，在一些石头上找到一个角落，躺在暴露在风和元素中的一面。它们喜欢肉和香水的礼物，当它们被抱来抱去时兴奋地鸣叫。到了晚上，寻求火花的群体会表演精心制作的交配舞蹈，用闪电和强风照亮天空。它们的整个群落协同工作，可以引发一场巨大而可怕的风暴，使它们在文明地区附近变得危险。",
	"Summoning one is simple: light the brazier, chant the proper words and praises to the Lord of Storms, extinguish the brazier with water, and then your desired spark seeker will appear from within the resulting fog and steam.": "召唤一个人很简单：点燃火炉，向风暴之神念叨适当的话语和赞美，用水熄灭火炉，然后你想要的火花寻求者会从产生的雾气和蒸汽中出现。",
	"Whenever more than 10 spark seekers are together, they can act as a single unit to form a spark seeker swarm. Add their total hit points together to determine the total hit points of the swarm. For every 5 spark seekers that the swarm starts with, it can make one additional spikeshard attack during its turn without using an action.": "每当10个以上的火花寻觅者在一起时，他们可以作为一个单位形成一个火花寻觅者群。将它们的总命中率加在一起，就可以确定火种群的总命中率。火花机群开始时每有5个火花机，它就可以在其回合内进行一次额外的尖刺攻击而不需要使用行动。",

Once a spark seeker has participated in a swarm that has cast this spell, it can't contribute to a new casting for one month.": "每当同一群火花爱好者超过100人时，这群火花爱好者就可以施展复仇风暴，只不过酸雨被替换成了冰冻雨，从而造成寒冷伤害。当以这种方式施放时，这个法术的蓄力DC是20。火花群中的所有火花寻求者都对这个法术的效果免疫。一旦火种寻求者参与了施放此法术的火种群，它在一个月内不能再参与新的施法。",

	"The symphonic songbird is a colorful avian creature that mimics the voices of others, and can produce a beautiful melody fit for any occasion. They seem to originate from birds that have fallen for the allure of the Perfect Chord and have been touched by the magical emanations that constantly flow from it. Infused with choral power, they speak and sing with the voices of any sounds they have heard. Oddly enough, they seem to prefer being exposed to a constant onslaught of sound when at rest, and will seek out the noisiest place around to build their nests.": "交响曲鸟是一种丰富多彩的鸟类生物，可以模仿他人的声音，并能产生适合任何场合的优美旋律。它们似乎起源于那些为完美和弦的诱惑所倾倒的鸟类，并被从它那里不断流出的神奇的散发所触动。它们注入了合唱的力量，用它们听到的任何声音来说话和唱歌。奇怪的是，它们在休息时似乎更喜欢暴露在持续不断的声音冲击下，并会寻找周围最嘈杂的地方筑巢。",
	"Colonies of songbirds will form full orchestral symphonies, to the delight of the rare few who are granted an audience. When threatened, they dazzle and strike with wicked beaks, inspiring one another to fight with fervor and fury against all aggressors. They enjoy gifts of fruit and shiny objects, which they use to build elaborate nests. Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. Summoning a symphonic songbird involves singing, as one might expect. The brazier is lit, the incense is burned, and the summoner must begin a melody of their own creation. It must be carefully done, so that there is room for another to harmonize without interruption or disruption, and is often difficult for novices. Once the song reaches the correct moment, the fire within the brazier will coalesce into the image of a songbird, and it will begin to sing along with its new master. The summoner must continue their song to an appropriate closing, guiding the bird out from the brazier at the same time. Once it has emerged fully and is corporeal, the warlock must end the song and speak their name. The symphonic songbird will repeat the name perfectly, and then speak its own. When the warlock does the same and speaks the songbird's name in exact mimicry, the bond between familiar and master will be formed.": "成群的鸣禽会组成完整的交响乐，让极少数获得听众的人高兴。当受到威胁时，它们会耀武扬威，用邪恶的喙进行攻击，互相激励，对所有侵略者进行狂热的战斗。它们喜欢水果和闪亮的东西作为礼物，用它们来建造精致的巢穴。然而，它们的歌声是引导旅行者误入歧途的传奇，在文明程度较低的地方，人们往往对它们抱有不信任和怀疑的态度。召唤交响曲鸟需要唱歌，正如人们所期望的那样。炉子被点燃，香被烧掉，召唤者必须开始唱他们自己创造的旋律。这必须小心翼翼地进行，以便有空间让另一个人在不被打断或干扰的情况下进行和声，这对新手来说往往是困难的。一旦歌声达到正确的时刻，火炉内的火就会凝聚成一只鸣禽的形象，它将开始与它的新主人一起唱歌。召唤者必须将他们的歌声持续到适当的结束，同时引导鸟儿从火炉中出来。一旦它完全出现并且有了肉体，术士必须结束歌声并说出自己的名字。交响曲鸟会完美地重复这个名字，然后说出自己的名字。当术士也这样做，并以完全模仿的方式说出鸣禽的名字时，熟悉的人和主人之间的联系就会形成。",

	"A deadly thing that lurks in the pockets of countless saints and villains alike, money is a tool that brings both salvation and misery. Not all funds can be trusted, however. The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.": "钱是一种致命的东西，潜伏在无数圣人和恶棍的口袋里，是一种既能带来救赎又能带来痛苦的工具。然而，并不是所有的资金都可以信任。货币阴谋已经逐渐用Karensee取代了世界上的原始货币，俗称为财富模仿品。它们可以采取无穷无尽的形式，但它们受到限制，不像它们较大的亲属。这些模仿者只能选择变成那些看起来有价值的物体。一枚金币、一张钞票、一块宝石、一串珍珠项链：所有这些东西都是潜在的财富模仿者。它们中的大多数都在沉睡，被困在一个单一的形式中。它们在沉睡时佯装损坏或其他不良影响，表现得与自然材料完全一样。然而，当它们被长生魔法唤醒时，它们就会活过来，攻击那些试图拥有它们的人。货币阴谋的成员经常使用一种仪式召唤并唤醒财富模仿者，但任何有足够力量和知识的术士都可以召唤一个。",
	"The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.": "第一步相对容易。召唤者必须点燃火炉，并站在火炉旁边，念出正确的咒语。一旦火被烧成灰烬，召唤者必须插入一个财富模仿者可以模仿的单一价值物品，如硬币或纸币。",
	"Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.": "接下来，术士必须提供血液。当几滴血滴在火炉内的物体上时，火焰将再次燃烧起来，吞噬物体，然后消失。灰烬将开始形成一个与物体相同的形状，一个新的财富模仿体将诞生。它将说一个词，给自己一个名字。只要它的主人知道这个名字，它就会完全服从，改变形状并按命令杀人。",
	"Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach.": "财富模仿者喜欢被喂食其他货币。一些学者低声说这是为了给他们权力，但其他人怀疑他们只是天生吃人。阴谋中的人被认为在创造财富模仿者时有一个内置的安全措施，以防最终计划出错。在这种情况下，他们会在被剥夺了其他肉体后疯狂地吞噬彼此，使他们对那些他们无法接触到的人无害。",

This elemental creature is neither fiend nor fey, but something primal and otherworldly. It is honored with ritualistic immolation and sacrifices of meat and metal. While the Wolf may have no hold over you, it may be interested in your affairs nevertheless, and your very existence could draw the ire of the Wolf's eternal foe: the frost-bound Wild Huntsman. With smoke and cinders pouring from your hands with each spell you cast and a layer of ash gradually creeping over your body, you are the incarnation of a smoldering ember thrown upon a dry forest.": "在你血统的某个地方，你的一个祖先与一个强大的火焰和捕食的精神达成了协议，被称为灰狼。这种元素生物既不是恶魔，也不是精灵，而是一种原始的、异世界的东西。人们用仪式性的焚烧以及肉和金属的祭品来纪念它。虽然狼可能无法控制你，但它可能对你的事务感兴趣，而你的存在可能会引起狼的永恒的敌人的愤怒：被霜冻束缚的野生狩猎者。你每次施法都会从手上冒出浓烟和焦炭，一层灰烬逐渐爬上你的身体，你是一个被扔在干燥森林里的燃烧的琥珀的化身。",

Also, you gain resistance to necrotic damage and immunity to effects that would kill you instantly without dealing damage.": "从10级开始，你获得了对居住在墓地中的灵魂的某种程度的控制。每当你周围60英尺内的敌对亡灵被降低到0命中率时，你会获得与你的术士等级相当的临时命中率。同时，你获得了对坏死伤害的抵抗力，以及对那些不造成伤害就能立即杀死你的效果的免疫力。",
	"At 14th level, you are as implacable as the specter of death itself. You no longer age and cannot be magically aged. You gain immunity to the {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened} conditions. As an action, you can mark a creature you can see within 30 feet of you with a terrible curse. When the creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to delay that damage and store it within a pool. At the end of each minute after the curse was cast, the target takes twice as much necrotic damage as is stored in the pool and the pool is emptied. This curse lasts for one hour or until the target dies.": "在14级的时候，你就像死亡的幽灵一样无情。你不再变老，也不能被魔法变老。你获得对（%0%）和（%1%）条件的免疫。作为一个行动，你可以用一个可怕的诅咒来标记你周围30英尺内你能看到的生物。当该生物受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应来延迟该伤害并将其储存在一个池子里。在诅咒施放后的每一分钟结束时，目标受到的坏死伤害是储存在池子里的两倍，并且池子被清空。这个诅咒持续一小时或直到目标死亡。",
	"You've nearly died. Sometime recently, or earlier in your life, you've fallen to the brink of death and felt your heartbeat stop. In that moment, far from hope, your spirit wandered the border of life and death, where it entered the Forbidden Graveyard. Amidst the sepulchers and crypts of this haunted dimension, you bore witness to the secrets of life and death, speaking with the fallen whose gaze chilled your very soul. Somehow, you returned from that fallen plane, but it has stained you. Your spirit is filled with both the eerie power of darkness and the flowing force of life, granting you the ability to touch the souls of others directly. You might still be living, but your every step is one of a dead man walking.": "你几乎已经死了。最近的某个时候，或者在你生命的早期，你已经跌落到死亡的边缘，感觉到你的心跳停止。在那一刻，远离希望，你的灵魂在生与死的边界徘徊，在那里它进入了禁忌墓地。在这个闹鬼的空间的墓室和墓穴中，你见证了生命和死亡的秘密，与堕落者交谈，他们的目光使你的灵魂感到寒冷。不知何故，你从那个堕落的世界回来了，但它已经玷污了你。你的精神既充满了阴森的黑暗力量，也充满了流动的生命力量，使你有能力直接触摸他人的灵魂。你可能仍然活着，但你的每一步都是一个行走的死人。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, your unnatural luck and affinity for the energies of life allow you to bring people back from the brink of death. When an ally within 5 feet of you is below half their hit point maximum, you can use your action to pour healing energy into them. The target recovers hit points equal to your rogue level + your Charisma modifier. If the target has been reduced to 0 hit points, they recover half as many hit points instead. Once a creature has been healed by this feature, it can't be targeted again until it finishes a long rest.": "从第三级开始，你的非自然的运气和对生命能量的亲和力使你能够把人从死亡的边缘拉回来。当你周围5英尺内的盟友低于其最大命中率的一半时，你可以使用你的行动将治疗能量注入他们体内。目标恢复的命中率等于你的流氓等级+你的魅力修改器。如果目标被降低到0命中率，他们会恢复一半的命中率。一旦一个生物被此功能治愈，它就不能再成为目标，直到它完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"At 3rd level, you learn to steal the life essence of your enemies, and your connection to the grave grants you incredible power. Whenever you or an undead you control kills a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or greater, you can choose to harvest a fraction of your victim's soul, binding it into a small object you keep about your person, such as a gemstone, doll, or weapon. Each object can contain only one such soul at a time.": "在3级时，你学会了窃取敌人的生命精华，而你与坟墓的联系赋予了你难以置信的力量。每当你或你控制的亡灵杀死一个智力值在6分以上的生物时，你可以选择收获受害者的一小部分灵魂，将其束缚在你随身携带的小物件中，比如宝石、玩偶或武器。每个物体一次只能包含一个这样的灵魂。",
	"As a bonus action, you can choose to unleash one of these enslaved spirits to do your bidding, freeing it from the item.

After the attack is made, the ethereal weapon vanishes.": "作为一个额外的行动，你可以选择释放这些被奴役的灵魂中的一个来为你服务，将它从物品中解放出来。如果灵魂被束缚在武器上，你会召唤出武器的鬼魂版本，并用它来进行一次近战武器攻击，攻击范围为15英尺。这次攻击会造成力量伤害。攻击完成后，空灵的武器会消失。",
	"If the spirit was bound to any other item, its release opens a small, shadowy rift to the Graveyard through the Ethereal Plane.

Each undead can use its reaction to move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks and ignoring difficult terrain.": "此外，你可以使用你的额外行动，使你周围60英尺内的所有友军亡灵涌现出超凡的力量。每个亡灵都可以使用它的反应来移动30英尺，而不会引起机会攻击，并且无视困难地形。",
	"At 17th level, your darkly stained soul fully reconnects with your body, allowing you to bridge the gap between the Graveyard and the other planes with ease. Whenever you roll initiative, you can choose one hostile creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature is marked by the Gate of Souls as a beacon for the energies of the fallen who lurk within the Graveyard. Once per turn when you deal damage to that creature, you can choose to bind a single soul from the Graveyard to an item in your possession. This mark lasts for one minute.": "在17级时，你那被黑暗玷污的灵魂与你的身体完全重新连接，使你能够轻松地在墓地和其他星球之间架起桥梁。每当你掷出主动权时，你可以选择一个你能看到的60英尺内的敌对生物。该生物被灵魂之门标记为潜伏在墓地中的堕落者能量的灯塔。每回合当你对该生物造成伤害时，你可以选择将墓地中的一个灵魂与你所拥有的物品绑定。这个标记会持续一分钟。",
	"You've made a pact with the cheerful wandering cubes of sentient ooze that wiggle and wobble their way across the multiverse. They visit worlds beyond measure with the singular goal of spreading their offspring within the deepest dungeons to collect and absorb the memories of the fallen.

You are not subject to acid damage that would be caused by a non-hostile ooze touching you, and you gain resistance to acid damage.": "在1级时，你获得了与渗水体对话的能力，并能交流简单的概念，即使它们不会说一种语言。你不会受到非敌对的渗虫接触你所造成的酸液伤害，并且你获得对酸液伤害的抗性。",
	"At 6th level, your body becomes somewhat... slimy. Whenever you suffer damage, you can use your reaction to divide into a Medium swarm of Tiny oozes. Your hit points remain the same, and you function as a single unified swarm that occupies the same space as a Medium creature. While in this state, you can't take actions other than the Dash action, your movement speed is halved, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, you gain immunity to acid and poison damage, you don't provoke opportunity attacks, and you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. You can return to your normal form at will without using an action, provided there is room to do so.": "6级时，你的身体变得有些......粘稠。每当你受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应来分裂成一群中等大小的细小渗虫。你的命中率保持不变，而你作为一个统一的虫群发挥作用，占据的空间与一个中型生物相同。在这种状态下，除了冲刺动作外，你不能采取其他行动，你的移动速度减半，你获得对打击、穿刺和切割伤害的抵抗力，你获得对酸和毒伤害的免疫力，你不会引发机会攻击，而且你可以在任何狭窄的1英寸空间内移动而不被挤压。只要有足够的空间，你可以在不使用行动的情况下随意恢复到你的正常形态。",
	"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 10th level, you can use this feature at will as an action. Using this feature as a reaction is still limited to once per long rest.": "一旦你使用了这个特性，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。从10级开始，你可以随心所欲地以行动方式使用这个特性。作为反应使用这个特性仍然被限制在每个长休息时间一次。",

	"The truth is, both are correct.": "事实是，两者都是正确的。",
	"Esoteric plasmology has long ties to the Gelatinous Convocation, which wanders between worlds spreading happy, cheerful slimes to all corners of the multiverse. Though direct interaction with the Convocation is uncommon for practitioners of this tradition, many are apprenticed to more powerful ooze wizards for a time as they learn to control their newfound power. While the slime core that awakens within a practitioner seems to grant a surprising amount of control over one's form, careful study and research is required to coax the more powerful magics from this arcane phenomenon. As such, ooze wizards traditionally adventure in order to expand their knowledge of the physical world, enjoying a life of leisure and hardship alike in their quests for purpose and power.": "神秘的质子学与胶质议会有着长期的联系，它在各个世界之间游荡，向多元宇宙的各个角落传播快乐、欢快的粘液。尽管对这个传统的从业者来说，与圣会的直接互动并不常见，但许多人在学习控制他们新发现的力量时，会在更强大的渗水巫师那里当一段时间的学徒。虽然在修行者体内觉醒的粘液核心似乎可以对自己的形态进行惊人的控制，但要想从这种神秘的现象中获得更强大的魔力，就必须进行仔细的学习和研究。因此，渗水巫师传统上都是通过冒险来扩展他们对物质世界的认识，在追求目标和力量的过程中享受休闲和艰辛的生活。",
	"When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, a slime core develops within your body, allowing you to assume the primordial form of the first acolytes of the Convocation. As an action, you can enter a primordial form, filling yourself with the giddy glee of an ooze and changing your appearance to appear as a slime-like caricature of your normal form. You gain advantage on Charisma checks and gain resistance to acid damage, but you suffer disadvantage on Wisdom checks. You can exit this form as an action, though doing so requires a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.": "当你在2级时选择了这个传统，一个粘液核心就会在你的身体里发展起来，使你能够呈现出圣会的第一批圣徒的原始形态。作为一个动作，你可以进入一个原始形态，使自己充满渗水的喜悦，并改变你的外表，使之成为你正常形态的一个粘液状的漫画。你在魅力检查中获得优势，并获得对酸性伤害的抵抗力，但你在智慧检查中处于劣势。你可以在行动中退出这个形态，不过这样做需要用智慧救赎来对抗你的法术救赎DC。",
	"Also at 2nd level, your newfound malleability and magical aptitude grants you several benefits. You can use an action to begin to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light in a 20-foot radius.": "同样在2级时，你新发现的可塑性和魔法能力赋予你一些好处。你可以使用一个动作，开始在10英尺的范围内发出亮光，在20英尺的范围内发出暗光。",

	"At 6th level, the mystical motions you perform when casting spells become fluid and warped, causing slime to drip from your fingertips with every gesture. Whenever you cast a spell, you can choose an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The coiling ooze from your hands assembles in this space, forming a 5-foot cube of colorful slime. This slime is immobile, provides half cover, has an AC of 6, and has hit points equal to your wizard level. The slime remains until you dismiss it (no action required) or it is destroyed.": "在6级时，你施法时的神秘动作变得流畅而扭曲，使粘液从你的指尖随着每一个手势而滴落。每当你施展法术时，你可以在你周围10英尺内选择一个无人的空间。从你手中流出的卷曲的渗出物会在这个空间集合，形成一个5英尺长的彩色粘液立方体。这个粘液是不动的，提供一半的掩护，有一个6级的攻击力，并且拥有与你的巫师等级相等的命中率。粘液会一直存在，直到你将其解散（不需要行动）或被摧毁。",
	"As a bonus action, you can cause one of these slimes to extend a pseudopod to grab a creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If they fail, they are grappled by the cube. The DC to escape from the grapple is equal to your spell save DC.": "作为一个额外的动作，你可以使其中一个史莱姆伸出一个假肢来抓住5英尺内的生物。目标必须对你的巫师法术救赎DC做一个力量救赎。如果他们失败了，他们就会被这个立方体抓紧。从抓捕中逃脱的难度等于你的法术救赎难度。",
	"At 10th level, the magic you wield becomes further infused with ooze. Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of \"Instantaneous\" that affects an area, you can use a bonus action to summon a mass of slime in the area. The ground within the area becomes difficult terrain for one minute, or until another spell is cast targeting the area that inflicts fire, cold, or necrotic damage. Creatures that end their turn within the area suffer 1d6 acid damage. You ignore the effects of this slime.": "在10级的时候，你挥舞的魔法会进一步被渗水所浸润。每当你施展持续时间为 \"瞬间 \"的法术影响一个区域时，你可以使用一个额外行动在该区域内召唤一团粘液。该区域内的地面在一分钟内会变成困难地形，或者直到针对该区域施展另一个造成火、冷或坏死伤害的法术。在该区域内结束其回合的生物会受到1d6的酸性伤害。你无视这种粘液的影响。",
	"At 14th level, your mastery of the arts of esoteric plasmology has granted you a connection with the Gelatinous Convocation, allowing you to tap into their understanding of the world through the creatures they have gracefully consumed. Whenever you are in your primordial form, you can add your proficiency bonus to any skill or ability check you make.": "在14级时，你对深奥的浆液学艺术的掌握使你与胶质共鸣者建立了联系，使你能够通过他们优雅地吞噬的生物来获取他们对世界的理解。每当你处于原始形态时，你可以把你的熟练度加到你所做的任何技能或能力检查上。",
	"Additionally, you learn to cast speak with dead as a ritual.": "此外，你还学会了作为一种仪式施展与死人对话的能力。",
	"Your dedication to art and beauty has led you to discover the art of creating a Gray Portrait: an artifact that your soul and body are bound to that channels the ambitions you have always held but never revealed. The portrait reflects your inner self and the dark desires you hold, and suffers the damage you would take, the diseases you would contract, and the cruelty you may inflict. It grants you the power to use your art to perform feats of incredible magic, and to paint beauty and ugliness alike upon the fabric of reality. This freedom often has hideous consequences, as you are forever tormented by the demands of that horrible self that lurks within your painted mirror. You are not yourself. You are a copy, a false perfection created by a master, and your master's demands must be met.

	"At 1st level, you create and magically bind yourself to your Gray Portrait. The Gray Portrait is a Small or Medium object that weighs at least 15 pounds, has AC 15, hit points equal to four times your warlock level, resistance to all damage, and uses your statistics for saving throws. It can be repaired at a rate of 1 hit point per minute. You can choose to see through the Portrait's eyes at any time and are always aware of its current state. If your portrait is destroyed, you tirelessly construct another during your next long rest, and you gain no benefit from that long rest.": "在1级时，你创造并以魔法方式将自己与你的灰色画像绑定。灰色画像是一个小型或中型物体，至少有15磅重，有15点攻击力，命中率相当于你的术士等级的4倍，对所有伤害都有抵抗力，并使用你的统计数据来进行蓄力攻击。它可以以每分钟1点命中率的速度进行修复。你可以选择在任何时候通过肖像的眼睛看到它，并且总是知道它当前的状态。如果你的画像被毁，你会在下一次长时间休息时不知疲倦地建造另一个画像，而你不会从那次长时间休息中获得任何好处。",
	"If a spell has the sole effect of restoring you to life, such as {@spell revivify}, the caster can cast the spell on the portrait as though it were your whole corpse without using material components,causing you to step forth from your portrait. However, if your portrait is destroyed and you are dead, you can't be revived without the use of the {@spell wish} spell.": "如果一个法术的唯一效果是让你恢复生命，例如{@spell revivify}，施法者可以在画像上施法，就像它是你的整个尸体一样，不需要使用物质成分，使你从画像上走出来。然而，如果你的画像被毁，你已经死了，如果不使用{@spell wish}的法术，你就不能复活。",

Whenever a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you cast using a warlock spell slot, you can use your bonus action to tear an unseen fraction of their life from them. When you do, you learn the target's ability scores. For 1 minute, you gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws associated with their highest ability score, and they gain disadvantage on their first saving throw associated with that score.": "在6级时，你的肖像的欲望开始追上你，只有残忍或创造才能满足它。每当一个生物对你用术士法术槽施放的法术的救赎成功时，你可以使用你的额外行动从他们身上撕下一个看不见的生命片段。当你这样做时，你会了解目标的能力分数。在1分钟内，你在与他们最高能力分数相关的能力检查和蓄力投掷上获得优势，而他们在与该分数相关的第一次蓄力投掷上获得劣势。",
	"At 10th level, your distinction between reality and the false world of art grows ever thinner. As a bonus action, you can touch an artwork that is Large or larger, creating a portal to a demiplane. The demiplane can be up to 100 feet in every dimension, depending on the level of detail present in the artwork. Any object, creature, or effect can pass through into the art demiplane freely as though the art was an open doorway to another room. The demiplane duplicates the subject of the artwork, containing all objects and locations depicted therein. Everything within the artwork is static, including painted creatures, instantly disintegrates to dust if removed, and has no value. While within, everything from the real world changes in appearance to match the style of the art. A creature trying to detect that something within the art demiplane is real has disadvantage on checks made to do so, and creatures standing still within the art demiplane have advantage on Stealth checks. While you are in an art demiplane, you have advantage on checks made to identify objects, people, and concepts represented within.": "在10级的时候，你在现实和虚假的艺术世界之间的区别变得越来越小。作为一个额外的动作，你可以触摸一个大的或更大的艺术品，创造一个通往半位面的入口。半位面在每个维度上都能达到100英尺，这取决于艺术品的细节程度。任何物体、生物或效果都可以自由地通过艺术品的半位面，就像艺术品是一个通往另一个房间的敞开的门。半位面复制了艺术品的主题，包含其中描述的所有物体和地点。艺术品中的所有东西都是静止的，包括画中的生物，如果被移走，会立即分解成灰尘，而且没有价值。在艺术作品中，现实世界的一切都会在外观上发生变化，以配合艺术作品的风格。试图检测艺术半位面内的东西是否真实的生物在接受检查时处于劣势，而在艺术半位面内静止的生物在隐身检查时具有优势。当你在一个艺术世界中时，你在识别物体、人和概念的检查中具有优势。",

Through your intensive study of anatomy and artistry, you've begun to unlock the secrets of instilling your soul into your creations. The creation of a Gray Portrait is a perversion of this technique, linking one's whole essence and intrinsic talent to a single piece of art. Artisans like you view that heretical practice as shortsighted and limited. True artistic mastery lies in the ability to imbue each masterpiece with a fragment of one's soul, binding each creation to the artist in an elegant and harmonious union. Your skill and talent in the manipulation of your life essence allows you to create and animate works of art in your own image. Narcissism is common among the practitioners of this College, though it can hardly be faulted.
