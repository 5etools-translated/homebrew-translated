	"A knight standing on the deck of a ship in space.  He doesn't freeze. He doesn't blow up. He doesn't float away. Everything that follows comes out of that one image...": "一个骑士站在太空中飞船的甲板上。 他没有被冻住。他不会被炸毁。他没有飘走。接下来的一切都来自于这一个画面...",
	"Imagine that you're standing on your favorite D&D world. All around you, there might be forests, swamps, mountains, bogs, ruins, cities, and more. Beneath your feet, there are countless labyrinthine tunnels and cave systems, perhaps even the Underdark. Whether you're traveling along your favorite D&D world's surface or in the caverns below, we have a good idea of how to run a game in that environment.": "想象一下，你正站在你最喜欢的D&D世界上。在你的周围，可能有森林、沼泽、山脉、沼泽、废墟、城市，以及更多。在你的脚下，有无数的迷宫般的隧道和洞穴系统，甚至可能是地下世界。无论你是沿着你最喜欢的D&D世界的表面旅行，还是在下面的洞穴中旅行，我们都有一个很好的想法，如何在这种环境中运行一个游戏。",
	"Now what we if we look up? Sure, there may be a cloud city, but I mean what if we look way up? What if we look up at a star and wonder what's up there? How do we go there? You might try flying, but you don't make it far before the spell fails and exhaustion takes over. Perhaps an airship? How does your airship fly when the air of the upper atmosphere begins to thin?  Is this some insuperable barrier to our exploration of fantasy worlds?": "现在，如果我们往上看呢？当然，可能会有一个云端城市，但我的意思是，如果我们抬头看，会怎么样？如果我们抬头看一颗星星，想知道上面有什么呢？我们怎么去那里呢？你可能会尝试飞行，但你没走多远，就被咒语打断了，疲惫不堪。也许可以用飞艇？当上层大气的空气开始变得稀薄时，你的飞艇如何飞行？ 这是我们探索奇幻世界的一些不可逾越的障碍吗？",
	"Wildjammer is a setting neutral rule-set inspired by the D&D campaign setting Spelljammer, created by Jeff Grubb and published by TSR, Inc. in 1989 as the flagship setting for D&D 2nd edition. Spelljammer gave us the means to bring our adventures up into space without losing any of the essential fantasy of D&D. It envisioned a universe structured in such a way that all D&D settings could be navigable without the rules or unique character of one setting hampering another.  Your character from Faerun (Forgotten Realms) could travel into space and find Oerth (Greyhawk) or Krynn (Dragonlance), or any other setting the DM decides to add. The goal of this Wildjammer is much the same: to offer a rule-set that can be used in a D&D 5th edition game to unite different settings and do so in a way that doesn't hamper the essential fantasy flavor of D&D.": "Wildjammer是一个设定中立的规则集，其灵感来自D&D战役设定Spelljammer，该设定由Jeff Grubb创造，并由TSR公司在1989年出版，作为D&D第二版的旗舰设定。Spelljammer为我们提供了将我们的冒险带入太空而又不失D&D的基本幻想的方法。它设想了一个宇宙的结构，使所有的D&D设定都能被驾驭，而不会因为某个设定的规则或独特的性格而妨碍另一个设定。 你的角色可以从Faerun（被遗忘的领域）进入太空，找到Oerth（Greyhawk）或Krynn（Dragonlance），或者DM决定添加的任何其他设定。这个Wildjammer的目标也是一样的：提供一个可以在D&D第五版游戏中使用的规则集，以统一不同的设定，并以不妨碍D&D的基本幻想风味的方式做到这一点。",
	"Whenever we start talking about going to space, most of us immediately start thinking of science-fiction or science-fantasy tropes. We envision a universe with at least the veneer of being scientific, with the impossible explained by techno-babble. There isn't much out there that takes us into space and doesn't also add this guise of science to the universe.": "每当我们开始谈论去太空时，我们中的大多数人都会立即开始想到科幻小说或科学幻想类的题材。我们设想一个至少有科学外衣的宇宙，用技术性的废话来解释不可能的事情。没有什么东西能在带我们进入太空的同时不给宇宙加上科学的幌子。",
	"Wildjammer isn't science-fiction or science-fantasy, it's space fantasy. The universe isn't inherently scientific, it is inherently fantastical. You don't need every planet to be more or less spherical why not have a planet in the shape of a donut? Why not have planets that have a hollow earth inside of them? Why not have stars that are conscious and intelligent? This is fantasy after all! The limit is your imagination.": "Wildjammer》不是科幻小说或科学幻想，它是空间幻想。宇宙本来就不是科学的，它本来就是幻想的。你不需要每个星球都是或多或少的球形，为什么没有一个星球是甜甜圈的形状？为什么没有行星的内部有一个空心的地球？为什么没有有意识和智慧的星星？这毕竟是幻想! 限制是你的想象力。",
	"As you read through this supplement, you'll hear some really wild ideas that have no place in a scientific universe. I'd like to challenge you to extend your disbelief while going through this supplement, the same way we extend our disbelief when a monk runs 75 feet up a wall in a single turn of combat. Why can a sailing ship fly in space? Magic. Why do people not get sucked into the vacuum of space? It's a fantasy. Embrace it and enjoy the freedom of fantasy in space!": "当你读完这本补充资料时，你会听到一些非常疯狂的想法，这些想法在科学的宇宙中是没有地位的。我想挑战你，在阅读这本补充手册时，你要扩展你的信仰，就像我们在一回合的战斗中，当一个和尚跑上75英尺的墙时，我们要扩展我们的信仰一样。帆船为什么能在太空中飞行？魔法。为什么人们不会被吸进太空的真空中？这是个幻想。拥抱它，享受太空中的自由幻想吧!",
	"Much like Spelljammer, Wildjammer draws a great deal of influence from the Age of Sail and the Golden Age of Piracy. Rather than thinking of Wildjammer as fantasy Star Trek, think of it more like Pirates of the Caribbean, just in space. Think Treasure Planet, sailing out into the unknown to find the space equivalent of buried treasure in the sea of night. You're sailors, except instead of sailing the ocean blue and battling sea monsters, pirates, and finding islands with buried treasure, you're sailing through space, fighting off space monsters , pirates, and finding asteroids with buried treasure.": "与《咒语》一样，《荒野大镖客》从航海时代和海盗的黄金时代中汲取了大量的影响。与其把Wildjammer想成是幻想中的《星际迷航》，不如把它想成是《加勒比海盗》，只是在太空。想想《宝藏星球》，航行到未知的地方去寻找太空中被埋藏的宝藏，相当于在夜晚的海洋中。你们是水手，只不过不是在蓝色的海洋中航行，与海怪、海盗搏斗，寻找埋藏宝藏的岛屿，而是在太空中航行，与太空怪兽、海盗搏斗，寻找埋藏宝藏的小行星。",
	"If you've looked around the internet for a bit, you've probably noticed that there are quite a few projects like this one that seek to bring the wonder of Spelljammer to D&D 5e. You might be wondering why I've made this when there are already so many others out there.": "如果你在互联网上看了一会儿，你可能已经注意到，有不少像这样的项目，试图把《咒语》的奇迹带到D&D 5e中。你可能会想，既然已经有这么多其他的项目，为什么我还要做这个？",
	"Simply put, while I was looking around at different products for doing D&D in space, I came across the Dark Matter campaign setting by Mage Hand Press.  This book is an excellent science-fantasy space opera setting and rule book, perfect for those looking for a setting where Spelljammer meets Mass Effect. I highly suggest checking it out! While I was reading through it, I found that the book had a wonderfully intuitive ship combat system. I decided that I wanted to adapt that system for the space fantasy of Spelljammer. Thus was born Wildjammer: More Adventures in Space!": "简单地说，当我在四处寻找在太空中进行D&D的不同产品时，我发现了法师之手出版社的《黑暗物质》活动设定。 这本书是一本优秀的科学幻想太空歌剧设定和规则书，非常适合那些寻找 \"咒语 \"和 \"质量效应 \"的设定的人。我强烈建议你去看看。当我读完这本书时，我发现这本书有一个非常直观的飞船战斗系统。我决定，我想把这个系统改编为《咒语战士》的太空幻想。因此，Wildjammer就诞生了。更多的太空冒险!",
	"What makes the ship combat system stand out to me is how closely it mirrors ground combat. There are definitely some differences, but as a general rule of thumb, things in ship combat happen similar to how they happen in ground combat. When you fire a ballista, you're not using the ballista's attack bonus, you use your own. When a ship makes a saving throw, it is the Helmsman who makes the save, not the ship itself. Running a ship in this system treats the ship as a tool that you use and get better with as you level up, not as a stat block you use for this side game of D&D.": "舰艇战斗系统让我眼前一亮的是它与地面战斗有多么接近。肯定有一些差异，但作为一般的经验法则，舰艇战斗中发生的事情与地面战斗中发生的事情相似。当你发射弹弓时，你没有使用弹弓的攻击力，而是使用你自己的。当一艘船进行蓄力时，是舵手进行蓄力，而不是船本身。在这个系统中运行一艘船，把船当作你使用的工具，并随着你的等级提高而变得更好，而不是当作你在D&D的这个侧面游戏中使用的一个状态块。",
	"The first chapter of this supplement will be going over the universe of Wildjammer. This chapter starts from the perspective of a character on a normal D&D world, and then slowly zooms out to encompass all the other settings and the planes.": "本补充资料的第一章将介绍Wildjammer的宇宙。这一章从一个普通D&D世界的角色的角度开始，然后慢慢放大，包含了所有其他的设定和平面。",
	"In the second chapter, we turn our attention to character creation. This chapter has new options for playable species, as well as class features, subclasses, weapons, and spells. If you're going to be playing ina Wildjammer game, I highly recommend reading this chapter in particular.": "在第二章中，我们将注意力转向角色创建。这一章有关于可玩物种的新选项，以及等级特征、子等级、武器和法术。如果你要参加Wildjammer游戏，我强烈建议你特别阅读本章。",
	"The third and longest chapter is all about the ships we call wildjammers. This goes over how they work, how they move, how to manage them, example stat blocks, ship combat, and bridge crew roles.": "第三章，也是最长的一章，是关于我们称之为 \"野战 \"的船只。这包括它们如何工作，如何移动，如何管理它们，举例说明状态块，船只的战斗，以及舰桥人员的角色。",
	"The fourth chapter is an overview of the people and places that one can find throughout the infinite worlds of Wildspace.": "第四章是对整个威尔兹空间的无限世界中可以找到的人和地方的概述。",
	"The final chapter is a DM toolkit, resources to hel, understand and hopefully make it easier to run a game using Wildjammer.": "最后一章是DM工具包，是帮助、理解并希望能使使用Wildjammer运行游戏更容易的资源。",
	"Wildjammer isn't a projection into the future. It's a love letter to the Age of Sail.  This was an era from roughly the late-1500s to the mid-1800s that was dominated by naval warfare, gunpowder weaponry, piracy, naval trading companies, and privateers. This age of exploration saw massive ships with numerous masts and sails traveling across the world to far off lands. Wildjammer seeks to capture the same feeling, but in space.": "Wildjammer》并不是对未来的一种预测。它是一封写给航海时代的情书。 这是一个大约从15世纪末到18世纪中叶的时代，以海战、火药武器、海盗行为、海军贸易公司和私掠者为主导。在这个探索时代，拥有众多桅杆和风帆的大型船只穿越世界，前往遥远的地方。Wildjammer试图捕捉同样的感觉，但在太空中。",
	"Throughout this chapter, I'll be relating experiences aboard a wildjammer to their naval counterpart. My goal in doing this is to help you envision how space exploration can mirror that of a nautical adventure.": "在本章中，我将把乘坐野战船的经历与海军的经历联系起来。我这样做的目的是帮助你设想空间探索如何能够反映出航海冒险的情况。",
	"There are two ways we can talk about the universe here. We could start at the highest level and then zoom in, or start zoomed in and slowly extend our field of view out across the universe. In this chapter, we'll be doing the latter. We're going to start by visualizing things from the perspective of your character on a D&D world and then slowly zoom out until we've included the entire universe.": "在这里我们有两种方式可以谈论宇宙。我们可以从最高层开始，然后放大，或者从放大开始，慢慢将我们的视野延伸到整个宇宙。在本章中，我们将采用后者。我们将从你的角色在D&D世界中的视角开始想象，然后慢慢地放大，直到我们包括整个宇宙。",
	"At this point, I'd like to again emphasize that you should extend the same suspension of disbelief you give to most of the impossible things in fantasy as we go through the following chapter. Space is wild, and some of the things here are not at all realistic, but each plays a role in creating a universe that can work with any D&D setting.": "在这一点上，我想再次强调，当我们通过下面的章节时，你应该对幻想中大多数不可能的事情给予同样的悬念。空间是狂野的，这里的一些东西根本就不现实，但在创造一个可以与任何D&D设定相配合的宇宙时，每一个都发挥着作用。",
	"Lets say you're living on Toril, the planet of Forgotten Realms. One night, you leave the walls of Waterdeep and look up to the stars. You'd already know a few things about space. You'd know of the sun that warms and lights the day. You'd be aware of Selune, the moon of Toril with its glittering asteroids called Selune's Tears. You'd also be aware of those glittering lights in the night's sky that people call stars.": "假设你住在托里尔，被遗忘的领域的星球。一天晚上，你离开沃特迪普的城墙，抬头看向星空。你已经知道了一些关于太空的事情。你会知道温暖和照亮一天的太阳。你会知道塞卢尼，托里尔的卫星，以及它那被称为塞卢尼之泪的闪亮的小行星。你也会知道夜空中那些闪亮的光，人们称之为星星。",
	"What you might not know is that there are other planets out there, just like the one you're standing on.  These planets could be made of earth like the one you're probably on, or they could be made of water, lava, fire, air, flesh, plants, or anything. They could be spherical planets, or they could be in the shape of a torus, or a snowflake, or a cluster of floating chunks of earth. There are also asteroids, some which even have cities on them, nebulae, sargasso clouds, and all sorts of interesting things to find. These are celestial bodies, the objects and places that reside within the sea of night up above you.": "你可能不知道的是，外面还有其他星球，就像你所站的那个。 这些行星可能是由地球构成的，就像你可能在的那个，或者它们可能是由水、熔岩、火、空气、肉体、植物或任何东西构成。它们可能是球形的行星，也可能是环形的，或者是雪花状的，或者是一簇漂浮的大块的地球。还有小行星，有些小行星上甚至有城市，星云，马尾云，以及各种有趣的东西，都可以找到。这些都是天体，是居住在你上方的夜海中的物体和地方。",
	"Celestial bodies are not required to obey the normal laws of physics. They can be made of anything and they can rotate and revolve in any direction. You can have a flat ribbon of water flowing in and between asteroids in an asteroid belt that ships sail on between floating asteroids. You can have a planet that is hollow and people live on the inside surface. Put a sun in there if you want! You can have square worlds, triangular worlds, disc worlds, turtle worlds, whatever! You are not bound by physics, as these were crafted by gods or magic. The only limit is your imagination!": "天体不需要遵守正常的物理学定律。它们可以由任何东西组成，可以在任何方向上旋转和转动。你可以有一条平坦的水带，在小行星带中的小行星之间流动，船只在漂浮的小行星之间航行。你可以有一个中空的星球，人们住在里面的表面。如果你愿意，还可以在里面放一个太阳。你可以有正方形的世界，三角形的世界，圆盘的世界，龟形的世界，任何东西！你可以不受物理学的约束。你不受物理学的约束，因为这些都是由神或魔法制作的。唯一的限制是你的想象力!",
	"Celestial bodies are like islands. While you might spend a lot of your time sailing the seas of space, it is usually on these islands where you'll find buried treasure, port cities to resupply, and adventure!": "天体就像岛屿。虽然你可能会花很多时间在太空中航行，但通常是在这些岛屿上，你会发现被埋藏的宝藏、补给的港口城市和冒险！在这些岛屿上，你会发现有很多东西。",
	"Now let's say you decide you want to leave your planet.  You decide you want to go up into the sea of night and find out what's up there. Maybe you want to see the moon up close, or travel out to a star, or find another planet and see who lives there. If you were to find a way to travel up and away from your planet, you'd eventually hit a threshold, a point where air and gravity simply stop. This is the boundary between your planet and what is called {@b wildspace}.": "现在我们说你决定要离开你的星球。 你决定要到夜海中去，看看上面有什么。也许你想近距离看月亮，或者去一颗星星旅行，或者找到另一个星球，看看谁住在那里。如果你要找到一种方法向上旅行，离开你的星球，你最终会碰到一个门槛，一个空气和重力简单停止的点。这就是你的星球和所谓的（%0%）之间的边界。",
	"Wildspace is essentially outer space, the empty void between celestial bodies that is often called the sea of night. It is suffused with a nearly imperceptible but ever present magical energy known as {@b aether}.": "荒野空间本质上是外太空，是天体之间的空虚，通常被称为夜之海。它充斥着一种几乎无法察觉但却永远存在的神奇能量，被称为（%0%）。",
	"Comparing this to an Age of Sail adventure, if a celestial body is an island, than wildspace is the sea.  Just as the sea is comprised of a large amount of water, wildspace is comprised of a large amount of aether.  Now keep in mind that wildspace is the sea, not yet the ocean. When we look at the wildspace around the Forgotten Realms setting, it's like we're looking at an archipelago of islands.": "将此与《航海时代》的冒险相比较，如果天体是一个岛屿，那么荒野空间就是大海。 就像大海是由大量的水组成的一样，wildspace是由大量的乙醚组成的。 现在请记住，wildspace是海，还不是海洋。当我们看到被遗忘的领域周围的野性空间时，就像我们看到了一个岛屿的群岛。",
	"Your mind is made up. You want to leave your planet and set sail into wildspace, the sea of night. How exactly do you get off of your island?": "你的想法已经决定了。你想离开你的星球，驶入荒野空间，夜之海。你究竟如何离开你的岛屿？",
	"The first challenge you face in leaving your planet is gravity. Imagine that gravity is like a powerful rip tide, always pulling you back in when you try to leave. That said, gravity behaves differently in Wildjammer than you might expect. Unlike real-life, gravity is either on or off, and it always pulls like earth-normal gravity, unless magic gets involved to amplify or hamper it. In other words, gravity doesn't get stronger or weaker based on its source, it just extends out farther from the source. Any object with a dimension of 25 feet or more has a gravity field.": "离开你的星球，你面临的第一个挑战是重力。想象一下，重力就像一个强大的裂缝潮，当你试图离开时，总是把你拉回来。也就是说，在《荒野大镖客》中，重力的表现与你想象的不同。与现实生活不同的是，重力要么开启，要么关闭，而且它总是像地球上的正常重力一样拉动，除非有魔法介入，放大或阻碍它。换句话说，重力不会因为它的源头而变强或变弱，它只是从源头延伸到更远的地方。任何尺寸在25英尺以上的物体都有一个重力场。",
	"You might wonder why this never comes up in your favorite D&D setting. The answer is that when two sources of peavey) are in close contact, the larger field trumps the smaller. Since everything on a planet is smaller than the planet, the planet's gravity is the only one in effect (unless some form of magic is used). Only in wildspace can two gravity fields overlap without one disabling the other, and even then only if the sources don't touch.  ": "你可能会想，为什么这在你最喜欢的D&D设置中从未出现过。答案是，当两个 \"豌豆 \"的源头紧密接触时，较大的磁场会战胜较小的。由于行星上的一切都比行星小，所以行星的重力是唯一有效的重力（除非使用某种形式的魔法）。只有在荒野空间中，两个重力场才可以重叠而不使另一个失效，即使如此，也只有在源头不接触的情况下。",
	"Another interesting feature about gravity is that it always pulls in the direction most convenient to the source. This usually results in a single gravity source that pulls all things toward it. For example, a planet pulls down to the core, while a wildjammer's gravity pulls down to the main deck of the snip Similarly, a dragon could lay down on its gravity plane and swim through space. They just can't get close to the planet.": "关于重力的另一个有趣的特点是，它总是朝着对来源最方便的方向拉动。这通常会导致一个单一的重力源将所有东西拉向它。例如，一颗行星向下拉向核心，而野人的引力则向下拉向主甲板的狙击手 同样，一条龙可以躺在它的引力平面上，在太空中游泳。他们只是不能靠近行星。",
	"This leads to some interesting physics. First, imagine a classic Age of Sail ship. There's the main deck, masts, sails, and all of that. The gravity field runs along the main deck, pulling you down onto it while you're standing on it. If you go beneath the main deck, you end up swinging past the gravity plane so you're standing on the underside of the main deck! You're upside down from those on the main deck. Luckily, most ships that go into space are designed to make the gravity field pull to the lowest deck, so this doesn't always come up.": "这导致了一些有趣的物理学问题。首先，想象一艘经典的航海时代的船。有主甲板、桅杆、船帆和所有这些东西。重力场沿着主甲板运行，当你站在上面时，会把你拉到甲板上。如果你走到主甲板下面，你最终会荡过重力平面，所以你就站在主甲板的下面！你和那些站在主甲板下面的人相比，是颠倒的。你和主甲板上的人是颠倒的。幸运的是，大多数进入太空的飞船都被设计成使重力场拉到最低的甲板上，所以这并不总是出现。",
	"Now that you understand gravity, what about air? How are you supposed to breath outside of the air of your planet? In Wildjammer, all creatures and objects can carry a certain amount of air out into wildspace with them based on their size. The size of this air bubble is always the same as the size of the gravity field, if the creature or object has one. All things can carry air into empty space, but only larger things have gravity.": "现在你理解了重力，那空气呢？你应该如何在你的星球的空气之外呼吸呢？在《荒野猎人》中，所有的生物和物体都可以根据它们的大小携带一定量的空气到荒野空间。这个空气泡的大小总是与重力场的大小相同，如果该生物或物体有一个重力场的话。所有的东西都可以带着空气进入空旷的空间，但只有较大的东西才有重力。",
	"What this means is that as soon as you find a way off of your planet's gravity field, you're also going to leave its air envelope and take only as much air as your size allows. This means you'll want something large like a wildjammer. These ships are large enough that they carry a substantial air bubble with them wherever they go. Similarly, massive creatures like dragons that fly through space carry their own air bubble that can sometimes be enough to sustain them for long trips.": "这意味着，一旦你找到离开你的星球引力场的方法，你也要离开它的空气包络层，并在你的尺寸允许的范围内只取用尽可能多的空气。这意味着你会想要一些大型的东西，如野战船。这些飞船足够大，无论走到哪里都会带着大量的空气泡。同样，像龙这样在太空中飞行的巨大生物也会携带自己的空气泡，有时足以支撑它们进行长途旅行。",
	"Be wary however, you can end up running out of air!  All wildjammers can carry an amount of air based on their size. The more creatures aboard that breath the air, the less time it takes to expend it all. Once the air is expended, it becomes fouled, giving all creatures breathing it disadvantage on all checks. The fouled air lasts just as long as the fresh air did. If this fouled air is expended, the air becomes lethal and all creatures aboard gain a point of exhaustion every minute they breath the lethal air.": "但是要注意，你可能最终会耗尽空气!  所有的野战船都可以根据它们的大小携带一定量的空气。船上呼吸空气的生物越多，耗尽空气所需的时间就越短。一旦空气耗尽，它就会变得污浊，使所有呼吸它的生物在所有检查中处于不利地位。污浊空气的持续时间与新鲜空气的持续时间相同。如果这些污浊的空气被消耗掉了，空气就会变成致命的，所有在船上的生物每呼吸一次致命的空气就会获得一分疲惫。",
	"Luckily, getting new air isn't too difficult! Whenever two air envelopes come into contact, the air distributes evenly between the two envelopes. For example, if two equal sized air envelopes overlapped, and one of them is lethal and the other is completely fresh, they would both split the difference and become foul. This isn't the best way to get new air.": "幸运的是，获得新空气并不太困难! 每当两个空气包络体接触时，空气会在两个包络体之间均匀分布。例如，如果两个同等大小的空气包络体重叠，其中一个是致命的，另一个是完全新鲜的，它们都会分出差异，变成污浊。这并不是获得新空气的最佳方式。",
	"The best and most common way to get new air is to sail your wildjammer close enough to a planet's atmosphere that the ship's air envelope overlaps with the planet's air envelope. Since the planet has so much more air than the ship, the ship's air bubble is fully replenished. It is also possible to restore some air to an air envelope by finding pockets of air around asteroids. The air in asteroid fields is generally far less abundant than in the atmosphere of a planet.": "获得新空气的最好和最常见的方法是将你的野战船驶近一个星球的大气层，使飞船的空气包络层与星球的空气包络层重叠在一起。由于星球的空气比飞船多得多，所以飞船的空气泡得到了充分的补充。也可以通过寻找小行星周围的空气袋来恢复空气包络的一些空气。小行星领域的空气通常比行星的大气层中的空气要少得多。",
	"Now we know that to escape from our planet, we need to find a way to get past our planet's gravity and a way to carry a lot of air with us. A wildjammer will carry the air for us, so we just need a way to escape from our planet's gravity field. Luckily, having a wildjammer allows the person flying it to see aether currents, rivers of luminescent blue energy that descend down from wildspace onto the planet.": "现在我们知道，要想逃离我们的星球，我们需要找到一种方法来避开我们星球的引力，以及一种能携带大量空气的方法。Wildjammer将为我们携带空气，所以我们只需要一个方法来逃离我们星球的重力场。幸运的是，拥有野战机的人可以看到乙醚流，即从荒野空间降落到地球上的发光蓝色能量河流。",
	"If a planet is an island, wildspace is the sea, and the aether is the water that comprises the sea, then these aether currents are like large rivers, bays, and inlets.  These make navigating from an island to the sea significantly easier. Just as different groups during the Age of Sail looked to control port cities, bays, and river ways, so too do factions in wildspace seek to control these points of entry into and out of planets.": "如果一个星球是一个岛屿，Wildspace是大海，而乙太是组成大海的水，那么这些乙太流就像大河、海湾和港湾。 这些使从一个岛屿到海洋的航行明显更容易。就像航海时代的不同团体希望控制港口城市、海湾和河道一样，荒野空间的各派别也在寻求控制这些进出行星的地点。",
	"To extend the comparison even further, just like natural rivers, bays, and inlets, catastrophes can occur that cause these to dry up and no longer provide access to wildjammers looking to ascend from or descend to the planet. These schisms can be caused by magical catastrophe or just through natural processes that aren't well understood. No matter what, those who are interested in controlling these shipping lanes into planets might find themselves scrambling to maintain control after such a shift! Even worse, all the aether currents could dry up, isolating the planet from the wildjammers of wildspace.": "为了进一步的比较，就像自然界的河流、海湾和进水口一样，灾难的发生会导致这些河流、海湾和进水口干涸，不再为想要从地球上上升或下降的野生动物们提供通道。这些分裂可能是由魔法灾难造成的，也可能是通过不甚了解的自然过程。无论怎样，那些对控制这些进入行星的航道感兴趣的人，可能会发现自己在这样的转变之后争先恐后地保持控制！更糟糕的是，所有的乙太凝结在一起，会让人感到不舒服。更糟糕的是，所有的乙太流都可能干涸，把这个星球与荒野空间的狂热者隔离开来。",
	"Alright! We've now escaped from our planet (island) and we've sailed along the aether (water) all around wildspace (the sea). In that time, you meet other creatures, encounter dangers in space, and all sorts of fun stuff. Eventually your eye might turn to one of the stars. What is there beyond this sea? What lies beyond wildspace? Where is the ocean in this comparison I've been making? You decide to find out. You turn your wildjammer to a star you see and you set sail away from the only planets (islands) that you have known.  Now things start to get weird! You've set sail, you've got a crew with you all eager to see what lies at that star you picked out. You have that same anxious optimism that Truman Burbank felt as he sailed out across the sea that had trapped in The Truman Show (1998). Just like Truman, you're in for a big surprise when the bowsprit of your wildjammer crashes into a wall.": "好了！我们现在已经逃离了我们的星球（岛屿）。我们现在已经逃出了我们的星球（岛），我们沿着乙太（水）航行到了wildspace（海）的四周。在这段时间里，你会遇到其他生物，遇到太空中的危险，以及各种有趣的事情。最终你的目光可能会转向其中一颗星星。这片海之外有什么？野生空间之外是什么？在我所做的这个比较中，海洋在哪里？你决定去找出来。你把你的野战机转向你看到的一颗星星，然后你启程离开你所知道的唯一的行星（岛屿）。 现在事情开始变得奇怪了！你已经起航了，你已经离开了。你已经起航，你有一群船员和你在一起，他们都渴望看到你选中的那颗星上有什么。你有那种焦虑的乐观情绪，就像杜鲁门-伯班克在《杜鲁门秀》（1998年）中被困在大海中航行时的感觉一样。就像杜鲁门一样，当你的野战船的船头桅杆撞上一堵墙时，你会有一个大惊喜。",
	"You walk to the fore of your ship and reach out. Your hand settles on a wall. That blackness you saw so long ago when you were standing on your planet is a wall, a shell surrounding wildspace on every side. What you're touching is called a crystal sphere.": "你走到你的船头，伸出手。你的手落在一堵墙上。很久以前，当你站在你的星球上时，你看到的那片黑色是一堵墙，一堵四面环绕着荒野空间的外壳。你所触摸的东西被称为水晶球。",
	"Crystal spheres are supermassive constructs so large they can contain an entire solar system (or more) within them. The idea of crystal spheres is based on the theory of the celestial spheres presented to us by Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Eudoxus, and Copernicus.  The theory held that our solar system is surrounded by a shell with the stars affixed to the inside of it.": "水晶球是超大规模的构造，大到可以在其中包含整个太阳系（或更多）。水晶球的概念是基于柏拉图、亚里士多德、托勒密、尤多克斯和哥白尼向我们提出的天体球理论。 该理论认为，我们的太阳系被一个外壳所包围，恒星贴在外壳的内部。",
	"In Wildjammer, these crystal spheres are real. These spheres mark the boundary of a campaign setting.  When you pass through a crystal sphere, you are officially leaving that setting and its rules behind.": "在《荒野猎人》中，这些水晶球是真实的。这些球体标志着竞选环境的边界。 当你通过一个水晶球时，你就正式离开了那个环境和它的规则。",
	"Even the gods are limited to the inside of the crystal Spheres: This makes it so that no matter how powerful the gods, how wild the lore, how unique the lore is, it doesn't influence any other setting out there. Want a low magic setting? Maybe a sci-fi setting? Maybe one where people are slowly driven insane due to an eldritch horror living in the sun? Maybe you want a sphere that just has a bunch of space turtles with worlds on their backs. All of this is possible just by wrapping it in a sphere.": "即使是神也被限制在水晶球的内部。这使得无论神灵多么强大，传说多么狂野，传说多么独特，都不会影响到外面的任何其他设定。想要一个低魔法的设定？也许是科幻设定？也许是一个人们由于生活在太阳中的长生恐怖而慢慢被逼疯的环境？也许你想要一个只有一群背着世界的太空乌龟的球体。所有这些都是可能的，只要把它包裹在一个球体中。",
	"Luckily passing through a crystal sphere isn't too hard. Natural portals appear and disappear seemingly at random along the crystal sphere. These portals can be located with lower level divination spells for the starting wildjammer crew, or they can be created with advanced wildjammer equipment or high level spells.": "幸运的是，通过一个水晶球并不难。天然的传送门沿着水晶球似乎是随机出现和消失的。这些传送门可以用低级别的占卜法术来定位，也可以用高级野战装备或高级法术来创造。",
	"In the ongoing comparison, think of the sphere as that point when you pass from the sea into the ocean itself. Behind you is an archipelago of islands, and ahead of you is the open ocean.": "在持续的比较中，把球体看作是你从海上进入海洋本身的那个点。你的身后是一个群岛，你的前方是广阔的海洋。",
	"Now lets continue on in our adventure. We repair the damage done to the hull by crashing into the wall of the crystal sphere unexpectedly and then we find a way to one of the portals on its surface. In much the same way that a sailing ship departs from an archipelago to set sail across the vast ocean, as you pass the threshold of the crystal sphere, you'll find yourself in the vast rainbow ocean known as the phlogiston.": "现在让我们继续我们的冒险。我们修复了因意外地撞上水晶球壁而对船体造成的损坏，然后我们找到了通往水晶球表面的一个传送门的方法。就像一艘帆船从一个群岛出发，在浩瀚的海洋中起航一样，当你通过水晶球的门槛时，你会发现自己在被称为phlogiston的巨大彩虹海洋中。",
	"The phlogiston, sometimes called the flow or the rainbow ocean, is a vast expanse of rainbow colors that fill in the space between crystal spheres. It is hard to describe the actual substance of the phlogiston, as it does flow into a ship's air bubble without replacing the air itself. It doesn't block sight except for things at a distance, much like a fog. It is like being in a rainbow colored expressionist painting.": "活塞，有时也被称为流动或彩虹海洋，是一大片彩虹色，填充在水晶球之间的空间。很难描述活塞的实际物质，因为它确实流进了船舶的空气泡中，而没有取代空气本身。除了对远处的事物，它不会阻挡视线，很像雾。它就像置身于一幅彩虹色的表现主义绘画中。",
	"Take a moment to imagine a fish tank. In this fish tank, we have an infinite amount of space and it is full of this rainbow substance. Floating around inside are these large glass balls, inside which is wildspace, celestial bodies, and all the civilizations we know from our D&D adventures. This is the material plane. See?  I told you things get wild in space!": "花一点时间想象一个鱼缸。在这个鱼缸里，我们有一个无限大的空间，里面充满了这种彩虹物质。里面漂浮着这些大玻璃球，里面是荒野空间、天体，以及我们在D&D冒险中知道的所有文明。这就是物质层面。看到了吗？ 我告诉过你，太空中的东西会变得很狂野!",
	"That said, the phlogiston has some odd properties.  The first and more important one is that it is highly flammable and acts like an accelerant. If you are brave or foolish enough to light a flame, you will invariably find the flame exploding the second it is ignited, likely harming you and your ship in the process. There have been many attempts over the years to attempt to weaponize the phlogiston, but regrettably it dissipates shortly after brought brought past the threshold of a crystal sphere. No one is sure why this happens, but it is probably for the best. If the phlogiston were ever to flow into a crystal sphere, it would find its way to the fire planets and sun, causing it to ignite the phlogiston and blow up the entire sphere!": "也就是说，活塞有一些奇怪的特性。 第一个也是更重要的一个是，它高度易燃，而且像助燃剂一样。如果你有足够的勇气或愚蠢地点燃火焰，你将无一例外地发现火焰在被点燃的一瞬间爆炸，很可能在这个过程中伤害你和你的飞船。多年来，人们曾多次尝试将菲力浦武器化，但遗憾的是，它在被带过水晶球的门槛后不久就消散了。没有人知道为什么会这样，但这可能是最好的结果。如果活塞流入水晶球，它就会找到火行星和太阳，导致它点燃活塞并炸毁整个水晶球！\"。",
	"Perhaps even more oddly, the phlogiston seems to ground dimensional or planar magic. All attempts to reach out to the inner or outer planes from the flow fail completely. This is because there are no planes while you're in the phlogiston!": "也许更奇怪的是，活塞似乎将维度或平面魔法置于地下。所有试图从流动中接触到内部或外部平面的尝试都完全失败。这是因为当你在活塞中的时候，没有任何平面！这就是为什么你在活塞中的时候，没有任何平面。",
	"The best way to think about the phlogiston is as an insulation between settings. No matter how powerful a god might be in Forgotten Realms, that god has no power in Ravnica until the DM decides they have powers and can act as a god in that setting. No matter what the writers for Greyhawk do with the planes, it doesn't contaminate what Eberron does with their planes. The phlogiston insulates against setting contamination, giving the DM the freedom to use whatever cosmos they like, or mix it up per setting.": "思考Phlogiston的最好方式是作为设定之间的绝缘体。无论一个神在《被遗忘的领域》中多么强大，在Ravnica中都没有力量，直到DM决定他们有力量并能在那个环境中作为一个神。无论格雷霍克的作者如何处理平面，它都不会污染Eberron对其平面的处理。活塞可以防止设定的污染，让管理员可以自由地使用他们喜欢的任何宇宙，或者按设定混合使用。",
	"With regards to the Age of Sail comparison, the phlogiston is like the open ocean. It is a vast, empty space that exists between archipelagos and continents.  Most of the time, all you'll see is the horizon until you reach new land, such as finding a new crystal sphere.  Just as sailors found routes across the ocean based on wind and water currents, so too are there flow currents in the phlogiston that help sailors navigate the flow.": "关于航海时代的比较，菲利普斯就像开放的海洋。它是一个存在于群岛和大陆之间的广阔、空旷的空间。 大多数时候，你看到的都是地平线，直到你到达新的陆地，例如找到一个新的水晶球。 就像水手们根据风和水的流动找到穿越海洋的路线一样，活塞中也有帮助水手们导航的流动。",
	"While combat can happen in the phlogiston, it isn't common. The open ocean is vast and the chance of running into another ship is slim when compared to the chance of running into another ship in a more densely packed archipelago. Even if you do encounter another ship, it is rare that they want to engage in combat due to the limits on gunpowder. Still, there are sailors that tell tall tales about great flow fiends that harvest unwary sailors who fall overboard. It's enough for most to remain vigilant out on the rainbow ocean.": "虽然战斗可能发生在活塞号上，但它并不常见。开阔的海洋是巨大的，与在更密集的群岛中遇到另一艘船的机会相比，遇到另一艘船的机会是很小的。即使你真的遇到了另一艘船，由于火药的限制，他们想参与战斗的情况也很少。不过，还是有水手讲述了关于大流魔的高大传说，它们会收割掉在海里的不小心的水手。这足以让大多数人在彩虹海洋上保持警惕。",
	"Now that we've discussed how you can take your ship across the material plane, from your home planet to a completely different campaign setting, what about the planes? Most D&D settings have some concept of the planes above, whether it be the Great Wheel from Planescape, the World Tree from Forgotten Realms, or even the Cosmology of Eberron. The different models can sometimes include similar or identical planes, or they could have completely new ones. This poses an interesting challenge to Wildjammer where our adventurers may travel from one setting to another, but not an insuperable one.": "现在我们已经讨论了如何让你的飞船穿越物质界，从你的母星到一个完全不同的战役背景，那么星球呢？大多数D&D设定都有一些上面的星球的概念，无论是Planescape的Great Wheel、Forgotten Realms的World Tree，甚至是Eberron的Cosmology。不同的模型有时会包括类似或相同的星球，也可能有全新的星球。这对我们的冒险者可能从一个背景到另一个背景的Wildjammer构成了一个有趣的挑战，但不是一个不可逾越的挑战。",
	"All of the planes reside within a massive ocean-like space called the Astral Sea, and a properly equipped wildjammer can get there and sail between the planes themselves, just as it would between worlds. This is made possible through an expensive upgrade to a wildjammer that etches powerful arcane runes to the hull which allow a spellcaster who casts {@i plane shift} to warp their ship and all of its passengers into the Astral Sea near the plane they want to reach. From there they can simply sail through the threshold of the plane to appear in it.": "所有的星球都居住在一个巨大的类似海洋的空间里，叫做星海，一艘装备精良的野战船可以到达那里，并在各星球之间航行，就像在世界之间一样。这是通过对野战船进行昂贵的升级来实现的，野战船的船体上刻有强大的奥术符文，允许施法者施展{@i plane shift}，使他们的船和所有乘客都进入他们想要到达的位面附近的星海。在那里，他们可以简单地驶过飞机的门槛，出现在飞机上。",
	"All that said, sailing the Astral Sea can be dangerous.  Massive monstrosities like the Astral Dreadnought swim around searching for prey. The dominions of the gods send out fleets to battle against one another, or protect the borders of their plane from attack. The Blood War itself reaches into the Astral Sea, with the Helljammers of Baator working regularly to restrain the expansion of the Scourge Fleet of the Abyss. Traveling through the Astral Sea is not something to take lightly!": "综上所述，在星海中航行可能是危险的。 像星际无畏舰这样的巨大怪兽在周围游走，寻找猎物。诸神的统治区派出舰队相互作战，或保护他们的星球边界不受攻击。血战本身也延伸到了星海，巴托尔的地狱干扰器定期工作以限制深渊祸害舰队的扩张。在星海中旅行是不能掉以轻心的。",
	"If you like this kind of content and want a more, check out The Planes Above by Rob Heinsoo, published in 2010 by Wizards of the Coast. It is a D&D 4e book all about sailing the Astral Sea!": "如果你喜欢这类内容并想了解更多，可以看看Rob Heinsoo的《The Planes Above》，2010年由Wizards of the Coast出版。这是一本关于在星海中航行的D&D 4e书籍!",
	"In Wildjammer, the planes can best be understood through the Infinite Planes model. Any plane the DM can imagine exists somewhere in the Astral Sea. These planes are completely independent of one another and the material plane until they are bound by thought, belief, and the faith of people in a crystal sphere. This means that the population of each sphere creates a metaphysical link between their sphere and a subset of the infinite planes. This in turn shapes how scholars of that sphere see the planar cosmos.": "在《荒野猎人》中，可以通过 \"无限平面 \"模型来最好地理解各平面。DM能够想象的任何平面都存在于星海的某个地方。这些平面完全独立于彼此和物质平面，直到它们被思想、信仰和水晶球中的人们的信念所束缚。这意味着每个水晶球的人口在他们的水晶球和无限平面的一个子集之间建立了形而上学的联系。这反过来又塑造了该球体的学者如何看待平面宇宙。",
	"For example, lets say a crew from Faerun which has a connection to the Great Wheel were to travel to Ravnica where there isn't a Mount Celestia. Although those people know about Mount Celestia, a plane shift spell couldn't bring them there because Mount Celestia isn't connected to that sphere. On the other hand, some planes do have connections in multiple spheres, like Mount Celestia being recognized in both the Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms campaign settings.  You could plane shift from either crystal sphere to the same Mount Celestia and back to either.": "例如，让我们假设一个来自Faerun、与大轮回有联系的船员前往Ravnica，那里没有天山。虽然这些人知道天山，但平面转移法术不能把他们带到那里，因为天山与那个球体没有联系。另一方面，有些星球确实与多个球体有联系，比如天山在灰鹰和被遗忘的领域的活动设定中都被认可。 你可以从任何一个水晶球到同一个天山，再回到任何一个水晶球进行平面转移。",
	"This allows a crystal sphere to be as independent from or engaged with other settings, even at the planar level. Hopefully you see how all of this, the phlogiston, the spheres, the Astral Sea comes together into a model of the multiverse that is highly adaptable and flexible to any campaign a DM wants to run!": "这使得一个水晶球可以独立于或参与其他设置，甚至在平面层面上。希望你能看到所有这些，活塞、球体、星海是如何组合成一个多元宇宙模型的，它对DM想要开展的任何活动都具有高度的适应性和灵活性",
	"When using magic that allows long distance travel, I use the following interpretation:": "当使用允许长距离旅行的魔法时，我使用以下解释。",
	"{@spell Teleport|phb} allows you to move between any two points in your current crystal sphere or plane.": "{@spell Teleport|phb}允许你在你当前水晶球或平面的任何两点之间移动。",
	"{@spell Dream of the Blue Veil|tce} allows you to move between two crystal spheres, but not within one.": "{@spell Dream of the Blue Veil|tce}允许你在两个水晶球之间移动，但不能在一个水晶球内移动。",
	"{@spell Plane Shift|phb} allows you to travel between your current sphere and any linked plane, between any linked planes, or from one of those planes back to a linked sphere.": "{@spell Plane Shift|phb}允许你在你当前的球体和任何链接的平面之间，在任何链接的平面之间，或从这些平面之一回到链接的球体。",
	"Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space...": "空间是很大的。你不会相信它有多么巨大，巨大，令人难以置信。我的意思是，你可能认为去化学家那里的路很远，但那只是太空中的小人物......",
	"Across the seemingly infinite expanse of the flow, there are countless spheres, each containing worlds that hold the potential for unique life, interesting civilizations, diverse cultures, and more. This means a game in Wildjammer is inherently a game with a great eal of diversity in character species, class aesthetics, items, spells, and all variety of character options.": "在看似无限广阔的流动中，有无数的球体，每一个球体都包含有潜在的独特生命、有趣的文明、多样的文化等等的世界。这意味着《荒野大镖客》的游戏本质上是一个在角色种类、等级美学、物品、法术和各种角色选项方面具有极大多样性的游戏。",
	"In this chapter, we'll be talking about a handful of character options to help bring some of that diversity to your Wildjammer game. We'll be going over some payable species, optional class features, subclasses, background considerations, new items, and new spells.  I recommend that all players in a Wildjammer game read this chapter before building their character!": "在本章中，我们将讨论一些角色选项，以帮助给你的《荒野猎人》游戏带来一些多样性。我们将讨论一些可支付的物种、可选择的等级特征、子等级、背景考虑、新物品和新法术。 我建议所有参加Wildjammer游戏的玩家在建立他们的角色之前阅读这一章。",
	"Wildjammer provides us with the freedom to bring together whatever settings, whatever source material, whatever random material we want into a single playable universe. This means Wildjammer is open to a great deal of species diversity. There is no assumption that humanity is the most common species you'll find in space. Humanity is just one of thousands! If you want to play a minotaur of Theros, a goblin of Ravnica, an elf of Forgotten Realms, a tinker gnome of Dragonlance, or a giff of Spelljammer, all are totally reasonable choices for a Wildjammer game!": "Wildjammer为我们提供了自由，可以将任何设定、任何源材料、任何我们想要的随机材料汇集到一个单一的可玩宇宙中。这意味着Wildjammer对大量的物种多样性是开放的。没有人假设人类是你在太空中找到的最常见的物种。人类只是成千上万的物种之一。如果你想玩Theros的牛头人、Ravnica的地精、被遗忘的领域的精灵、Dragonlance的工匠地精或Spelljammer的吉夫，都是Wildjammer游戏中完全合理的选择。",
	"Speaking of assumptions, there is no assurance that a species in Wildjammer will behave the same as ina campaign setting. For example, mind flayers in Wildjammer are more metropolitan than their groundling counterparts. This is because they are clinging to the vast vestiges of their once great empire before the Gith revolution, and that has forced them to being open to cooperating and trading with others. The most common advice given to a new ship is to keep an open mind and a tight grip on your weapon.": "说到假设，我们不能保证一个物种在Wildjammer中的行为会和在战役环境中的行为一样。例如，在Wildjammer中，思想传播者比他们的地面人更有都市感。这是因为在吉斯革命之前，他们还坚持着曾经的伟大帝国的巨大残余，这迫使他们对与他人的合作和贸易持开放态度。给予新船的最常见的建议是保持开放的心态和紧握你的武器。",
	"This supplement's species options were designed with the Tasha's Cauldron of Everything standard, allowing you to choose a +2/+1 between two different ability scores, or +1/+1/+1 across three different ability scores.": "这个补充的物种选项是以塔莎的万物之灵标准设计的，允许你在两个不同的能力分数之间选择+2/+1，或者在三个不同的能力分数之间选择+1/+1/+1。",
	"In this section, I'll be providing a few optional features for a few classes to help them have a better time in a Wildjammer game. Please consult with your DM before taking any of these features.

	"If an option here has the same name as a class feature, it adds to (not replaces) the core feature. Some optional features will add to a class' starting proficiencies gained at 1st level. Lastly, some features will add to a list of features, such as Fighting Styles.  You don't automatically gain this option, you can just choose it as you would any other from that list.": "如果这里的选项与等级特征的名称相同，它就会增加（而不是取代）核心特征。一些可选特征会加入到一个等级在1级时获得的起始熟练度中。最后，有些特性会添加到一个特性列表中，比如战斗风格。 你不会自动获得这个选项，你可以像选择清单上的任何其他选项一样选择它。",
	"An artificer is a master of engineering and tinkering that almost always has the right tool for a job. As such, they are a welcomed sight among any ship crew.": "工匠是一个工程和修补的大师，几乎总是有合适的工具来完成一项工作。因此，他们是任何船队中受欢迎的风景。",
	"As experts on nature, druids often find themselves both highly desired and out of their element in space.  Their ability to create food and cultivate nature make them invaluable, but sailing the stars takes the druid away from their planetary environment.": "作为自然界的专家，德鲁伊经常发现自己在太空中既被高度重视，又脱离了自己的元素。 他们创造食物和培养自然的能力使他们变得无价，但在星空中航行使德鲁伊离开了他们的行星环境。",
	"Fighters represent the best of the relentless pursuit for mastery over the weapons and techniques of war. The crew of a wildjammer would be vulnerable without the expertise of these warriors.": "战士们代表了对掌握战争武器和技术的不懈追求的最好结果。如果没有这些战士的专业知识，野战船的船员就会很脆弱。",

	"In this section, I'll out lining a handful of hopefully interesting subclasses that are flavored around different aspects of the Wildjammer campaign setting.  That said, these subclasses might have their origins in Wildjammer lore, but they can easily fit in any classic D&D adventure as well. Please consult with your DM before making use of one of these subclasses.": "在这一节中，我将介绍一些希望是有趣的子类，这些子类围绕着Wildjammer战役设定的不同方面而展开。 也就是说，这些子类可能起源于《荒野猎人》的传说，但它们也可以轻松地适用于任何经典的D&D冒险。在使用这些子类之前，请咨询你的管理员。",

	"Backgrounds play an interesting role in designing a character for a D&D 5e game. They not only provide a degree of mechanical benefit, but they help you fine tune who your character is and what they are good at.  Since Wildjammer makes it possible to bring people together from any world you can imagine, the options for backgrounds is virtually endless.": "在为D&D 5e游戏设计角色时，背景扮演着一个有趣的角色。它们不仅提供了一定程度的机械效益，而且还帮助你调整你的角色是谁以及他们擅长什么。 由于《荒野大镖客》可以将来自任何你能想象到的世界的人聚集在一起，所以背景的选择几乎是无止境的。",
	"Who was your character before they were in wildspace? A bounty hunter, a merchant, a guard? It could be that they were a sailor that was brought into wildspace by a people from the stars in a story similar to Styx's Come Sail Away. Or maybe your character has always been in wildspace, born on one of the asteroid cities. Whatever it is, your character's background gives you a good idea of how your character exists in the universe.": "你的角色在进入荒野空间之前是谁？赏金猎人，商人，警卫？他们可能是一个水手，被一个来自星星的人带到了荒野空间，故事类似于冥河的《远航》。也可能你的角色一直在荒野空间，出生在某个小行星城市。不管是什么，你的角色的背景让你对你的角色在宇宙中的存在方式有一个很好的概念。",
	"That said, there are some things to consider with your background. Some tool proficiencies simply have more value in a Wildjammer game than they might otherwise have in another D&D 5e game. Additionally, the backgrounds from the Ghosts of Saltmarsh (pg. 29) book require some slight adjustment to work in a Wildjammer game. In this section, we'll talk about both of these.": "这就是说，有一些事情需要考虑你的背景。有些工具的熟练程度在Wildjammer游戏中的价值比在另一个D&D 5e游戏中的价值更高。此外，《萨尔马什的幽灵》（第29页）一书中的背景需要稍作调整才能在荒野猎人游戏中发挥作用。在本节中，我们将讨论这两个问题。",
	"Depending on the type of game your DM runs, you might find that some tools have more value than others. If you're in an underwater adventure, your vehicles (land) proficiency might not end up being as useful as they otherwise would. Similarly, the nature of sailing through space means that a few tools have more value than they might otherwise have. I usually encourage players to use the customizing background rules from the Players Handbook (pg. 125) to get at least one of these tool proficiencies:": "根据你的DM所经营的游戏类型，你可能会发现有些工具比其他工具更有价值。如果你是在水下冒险，你的车辆（陆地）熟练度最终可能不会像它们那样有用。同样，在太空中航行的性质意味着一些工具的价值比它们本来可能具有的更大。我通常鼓励玩家使用《玩家手册》中的自定义背景规则（第125页）来获得这些工具的至少一种熟练度。",
	"This tool proficiency represents a character's ability to handle a ship sailing in the water. Since a wildjammer functions similar to a nautical ship, anyone who is proficient with vehicles (water) is also treated as proficient with handling a wildjammer. Your DM may call for yo to make an Intelligence (water vehicles) check to understand how the ship's sails work, or a - Dexterity (water vehicles) check for the Helmsman to avoid hitting an asteroid.": "这种工具的熟练程度代表了一个角色处理在水中航行的船只的能力。由于野战船的功能类似于航海船，任何精通车辆（水）的人也会被视为精通操控野战船。你的经理可能会要求你进行智力（水上交通工具）检查以了解船帆的工作原理，或者为舵手进行灵巧（水上交通工具）检查以避免撞上小行星。",
	"These tools have unique value in a Wildjammer game as they are the tools you'd use for making repairs to your ship. The vast majority of ships in this supplement are wooden ships) ss meaning it takes a carpenter's tools check to repair it. Nevertheless, through play you might end up with a metallic ship, in which case you'd want to use smith's tools instead. Anyone who wants to be a ship's boatswain should have this.": "这些工具在Wildjammer游戏中具有独特的价值，因为它们是你用来修理船只的工具。这本补充手册中的绝大多数船只都是木制的，这意味着需要用木匠的工具检查来修理它。然而，通过游戏，你可能最终会拥有一艘金属船，在这种情况下，你会想用铁匠的工具来代替。任何想当船夫的人都应该有这个。",
	"These tools allow someone to accurately read a star chart and plot a course through wildspace. Take this tool proficiency if you want to be able to keep the ship on course!": "这些工具可以让人准确地阅读星图，并在荒野空间中绘制出一条航线。如果你希望能够保持飞船的航向，那么就把这个工具熟练掌握吧!",

	"While looking at backgrounds, a player might notice that there are a variety of nautical themed backgrounds presented in the book {@adventure Ghosts of Saltmarsh (pg. 29-35)|gos|0|saltmarsh backgrounds}.

	"You gain advantage on ability checks made to use fishing tackle. While your ship isn't moving and is in wildspace, you can set up traps in the area around your ship to gather wild birds and space fish. So long as you have a few hours each day to fish, you can catch enough to feed yourself and up to five other people each day without making use of your ship's food stores.": "你在使用钓具的能力检查中获得优势。当你的飞船没有移动并且处于荒野空间时，你可以在飞船周围的区域设置陷阱来收集野生鸟类和太空鱼。只要你每天有几个小时的时间来钓鱼，你就可以捕到足够的食物来养活自己和其他五个人，而不用动用你的飞船的食物储存。",

This includes an overview of some background considerations, the prevalence of gunpowder in the Age of Sail and how to run it in a Wildjammer game, a set of new weapons your character may want to use, some subclasses and new class features to help characters feel more at home in a Wildjammer game, and lastly some spells.": "当你开始为Wildjammer活动制作你的角色时，你应该考虑很多关于空间的事情。在本节中，我们将讨论其中的一些事情，以及各种新的角色选择，以适应以Wildjammer为主题的游戏。这包括对一些背景考虑的概述，火药在航海时代的盛行以及如何在Wildjammer游戏中运行它，一套你的角色可能想要使用的新武器，一些子类和新的类特征，以帮助角色在Wildjammer游戏中感觉更自如，最后是一些法术。",
	"Many DMs shy away from using gunpowder firearms in their games. It might be because it doesn't fit the aesthetic of the game or because it feels too under- powered or unrealistic when compared to other weapons. As Wildjammer is influenced by the Age of Sail and the Golden Age of Piracy, I strongly encourage DMs to allow firearms in their Wildjammer game.": "许多管理员对在他们的游戏中使用火药枪支感到畏惧。这可能是因为它不符合游戏的审美，或者是因为与其他武器相比，它感觉动力不足或不现实。由于《荒野大镖客》受到航海时代和海盗黄金时代的影响，我强烈鼓励管理员在他们的《荒野大镖客》游戏中允许使用火器。",
	"Some fans of Spelljammer may be readying to throw tomatoes at me. In Spelljammer, there wasn't as much emphasis on gunpowder, instead cannons made use of a highly volatile and dangerous substance called smoke powder. Based on a {@link tweet by Ed Greenwood|https://twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953}, it seems like smoke powder was created due to concerns by TSR executives rather than out of a design choice. Since black powder is so prominent in Age of Sail stories, I feel it is essential to include!": "一些《咒语大师》的粉丝可能正准备向我扔西红柿。在《咒怨》中，没有那么强调火药，相反，大炮使用了一种叫做烟粉的高度挥发的危险物质。根据{@link tweet by Ed Greenwood|https://twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953}，烟火似乎是由于TSR高层的担忧而产生的，而不是出于设计上的选择。由于黑火药在《航海时代》的故事中非常突出，我觉得有必要把它包括进去！\"。",
	"As a result, a Wildjammer game should make use of firearms. I suggest the {@variantrule firearms|dmg|rules} presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide (pg. 266). The rules presented there are easy to use and don't add much complication to the life of a DM. Additionally, they are compatible with the feat Gunner from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (pg.  80). The firearms presented in the next section are built along these same lines.": "因此，《荒野猎人》游戏应该使用火器。我建议采用《地下城主指南》（第266页）中介绍的（%0%）。那里的规则很容易使用，而且不会给管理员的生活增加太多的复杂性。此外，它们还与塔莎的《万物熔炉》（第80页）中的 \"枪手 \"技能兼容。下一节介绍的火器也是按照这些思路构建的。",
	"Some people question the realism of how firearms are presented in these rules. That's fair, but D&D isn't a realistic game. We have magic, monks running up vertical walls for 90 feet, and so much more. What we probably care about is verisimilitude. Maybe instead of our firearms being barrel loaders, they are all breech loaded, like a shotgun you flip forward and load shells into. It has the veneer of being realistic while still embracing the fantasy of D&D.": "有些人质疑这些规则中的枪支呈现方式的现实性。这很公平，但D&D不是一个现实的游戏。我们有魔法，僧侣在垂直的墙壁上跑90英尺，还有更多。我们所关心的可能是真实性。也许我们的枪支不是桶装的，而是后膛装的，就像一把猎枪，你可以向前翻转，把子弹装进去。这就有了现实的外衣，同时还拥抱了D&D的幻想。",
	"Weapons in a Wildjammer game will generally range from your standard fifth edition simple and martial weapons up to Renaissance era firearms. Although DMs are free to add more futuristic weapons as they see fit (after all, you might end up in a science fiction sphere!), this supplement will focus on Renaissance era firearms as described in the DMG.": "在Wildjammer游戏中，武器的范围通常从标准的第五版简单和武术武器到文艺复兴时期的枪械。虽然管理员可以在他们认为合适的时候添加更多的未来主义武器（毕竟，你可能会在一个科幻领域结束！），本补充资料将专注于DMG中描述的文艺复兴时期的枪械。",
	"The DMG provides rules for two Renaissance era firearms, the {@item pistol|dmg} and the {@item musket|dmg}, on page 268. As these items are not in the SRD, I can't reprint them here. The firearms I offer in this section are in addition to those two presented in the DMG": "DMG在第268页提供了两种文艺复兴时期的火器的规则，即（%0%）和（%1%）。由于这些项目不在SRD中，我不能在此重印。我在本节中提供的枪械是DMG中介绍的那两种枪械之外的。",

	"In this section, we'll be talking about some spells that characters can take to aid their wildjammer in their voyage across the stars. Remember that when sailing through the phlogiston, there are some specific limits on spellcasting:": "在这一节中，我们将讨论角色可以采取的一些法术，以帮助他们的野人在穿越星空的航行中。请记住，在航行过程中的phlogiston，对法术的使用有一些特定的限制。",

	"Conjuration spells automatically fail if they pull energy from the planes.": "凝聚法术如果从星球上抽取能量，就会自动失败。",
	"Generally speaking, sailing through the phlogiston is a time for downtime activities and roleplay. While combat encounters can happen, they are like running into another ship on the open ocean, a rarity rather than the norm. Most traffic and encounters happen where there is more local traffic, in a sea or archipelago (that is, inside of a sphere).": "一般来说，航行在phlogiston中是一个停工活动和角色扮演的时间。虽然战斗相遇可能发生，但它们就像在公海上遇到另一艘船一样，是罕见的，而不是正常的。大多数交通和遭遇发生在当地交通较多的地方，在海洋或群岛（也就是球体内部）。",
	"At this point, I'd like to remind DMs that it generally isn't fun to have your class abilities hampered. While being isolated from the planes in the phlogiston helps build that feeling of isolation from a long ocean voyage, if you throw too many combat encounters at player characters that rely on planar stuff for their power, they are going to have a bad time. Use the phlogiston as a way to convey the space between settings and the isolation of long voyages: not to make your spellcasters regret their class choice!": "在这一点上，我想提醒DM，一般来说，让你的等级能力受到阻碍并不有趣。虽然在phlogiston中与各星球隔绝有助于建立那种与世隔绝的远洋航行的感觉，但如果你把太多的战斗遭遇扔给那些依靠星球上的东西来获得力量的玩家角色，他们就会过得很糟糕。用phlogiston来表达设置之间的空间和长期航行的孤立感：而不是让你的施法者后悔他们的等级选择",
	"Mega spells are massive spells created to battle wildjammers or mega creatures found in wildspace. These spells have no effect on creatures or objects not on mega scale or when used on a planet or settlement. They are only intended for ship to ship combat or for ship scale utility. During ship combat, a spellcaster can cast these spells on their turn instead of using one of their bridge crew roles.": "巨型法术是为了与野生动物或在野外空间发现的巨型生物作战而创造的大规模法术。这些法术对非巨型生物或物体没有效果，或者在行星或定居点上使用时也没有效果。它们只适用于船与船之间的战斗或用于船的规模。在飞船战斗中，施法者可以在他们的回合中施放这些法术，而不是使用他们的舰桥人员角色之一。",
	"While concentrating on a mega spell, you roll concentration as normal if you take damage or if the wildjammer you're on takes hull damage. You do not need to roll concentration for damage absorbed by bulwark points. For determining the DC of a concentration check, treat mega damage as if it were regular damage.": "当你专注于一个大型法术时，如果你受到伤害或你所在的野战船受到船体伤害，你就会像平常一样掷出注意力。你不需要为被堡垒点吸收的伤害掷出注意力。在确定注意力检查的DC时，将巨型伤害视为普通伤害。",
	"If a mega spell has a range of Self, it encompasses the entire wildjammer you are casting the spell from.": "如果一个巨型法术的范围是 \"自我\"，那么它就包括了你施放法术的整个野区。",
	"Some DMs may wish to allow some spellcasters with a fixed number of known spells (sorcerers, warlocks) to learn one mega spell for free every few levels to not hamper their normal spell list.": "有些DM可能希望允许一些拥有固定数量已知法术的施法者（巫师、术士）每隔几级免费学习一个巨型法术，以不妨碍他们的正常法术列表。",
	"No game of Wildjammer would be complete without the wildjammers themselves! It doesn't matter if you're looking to be pirates, privateers, part of a trading company, a group of mercenaries or bounty hunters, or explorers into the great unknown, you're going to need a ship to move around wildspace. This chapter is going to focus on describing everything you need to know about wildjammers, from how they work to their statistics and even how to fight with them!": "如果没有野蛮人自己，任何野蛮人游戏都是不完整的! 无论你是想成为海盗、私掠者、贸易公司的一部分、一群雇佣兵或赏金猎人，还是进入伟大的未知世界的探险者，你都需要一艘船来在荒野空间中移动。本章将重点描述你需要知道的关于野战船的一切，从它们如何工作到它们的统计数字，甚至是如何与它们战斗！本章将对野战船进行介绍。",
	"This chapter will begin by reviewing the five major components that make up a wildjammer. They are:": "本章将首先回顾构成野战军的五个主要组成部分。它们是",

	"The general shape and structure of the ship that primarily determines its statistics.": "主要决定其统计数据的船舶的一般形状和结构。",
	"On traditional Age of Sail ships, a ship's helm is that large steering wheel. In Wildjammer helms take on the appearance of large thrones that are conduits for magical power. When a spellcaster sits on these thrones, they can attune to the helm, allowing their magic to seep into it and then throughout the ship itself. This causes the Helmsman's senses to extend across the ship and allow them to move it as if they were moving their own bodies. Through this bond, a Helmsman is able to propel their ship at incredible speeds that allow them to sail across the vast distances of wildspace and the Flow.": "在传统的航海时代的船上，船舵就是那个大方向盘。在《荒野大镖客》中，舵手的外表是一个大宝座，是魔法力量的通道。当施法者坐在这些宝座上时，他们可以与舵手进行调和，让他们的魔法渗入其中，然后渗透到整艘船本身。这使得舵手的感觉延伸到整个船，并允许他们移动它，就像移动自己的身体一样。通过这种联系，舵手能够以难以置信的速度推动他们的飞船，使他们能够在荒野空间和水流的广阔距离上航行。",
	"The type of helm I just described is known as a Wildjammer Helm. It is the most common type of helm found around the spheres thanks to the effort of their main purveyors, the Arcane. Nevertheless, there are other helms out there. Mind flayers use a Pool Helm, a type of brine pool filled with illithid slugs that craw upon the psionic energy of the Helmsman.  There's the Orbus, a weakened and enslaved beholder that is used by other beholders to propel their Tyrant Ships. Dwarves favor a helm called the Forge Helm, which when installed into the core of a mountain can create propulsion from the energy of their creations, resulting in flying mountains. The neogi favor a type of helm called a Lifejammer Helm, an iron maiden like device that drains the blood and essence out of slaves and converts it into propulsion.": "我刚才描述的那种头盔被称为 \"野蛮人头盔\"。它是球体周围最常见的头盔类型，这要归功于其主要传播者--奥术师的努力。尽管如此，也有其他的头盔存在。心灵分裂者使用水池头盔，这是一种装满了幻术蛞蝓的盐水池，可以利用舵手的幻术能量爬行。 还有奥布斯，一个被削弱和奴役的头盔，被其他头盔者用来推动他们的暴君之船。矮人偏爱一种叫做 \"锻造头盔 \"的头盔，当它被安装到山的核心时，可以用他们创造的能量创造出推进力，从而使山飞起来。纽吉人喜欢一种叫做 \"生命之锤 \"的头盔，这是一种类似于铁娘子的装置，可以吸干奴隶的血液和精华并将其转化为推进力。",
	"Even these helms are only the tip of the iceberg.  While the Wildjammer Helm is the most popular due to how easily accessible it is, there are countless designs out there, far too many for this supplement to cover. There are even unique and legendary helms that exist only in legend for the right adventurers to find!": "即使这些头盔也只是冰山一角。 虽然野蛮人头盔因其容易获得而最受欢迎，但还有无数的设计，多到本补编无法涵盖。甚至还有一些独特的传奇性头盔，它们只存在于传说中，供合适的冒险者去寻找。",
	"A species of blue skinned giants called the Arcane run an incredibly powerful cartel that controls the sale and distribution of all Wildjammer Helms in the spheres. No one knows where the Arcane come from or how they build the Wildjammer Helms, just that they are the only ones who sell them and anyone who tries to cut in on that market quickly ends up dead.": "有一种被称为 \"阿卡恩 \"的蓝皮肤巨人经营着一个非常强大的卡特尔，他们控制着球体中所有野蛮人头盔的销售和分销。没有人知道Arcane是从哪里来的，也没有人知道他们是如何制造Wildjammer Helms的，只是知道他们是唯一出售Wildjammer Helms的人，任何试图切入这个市场的人都会很快死掉。",
	"Luckily the Arcane make it easy to get a hold of them. By simply spreading around any major city in any of the spheres that you're looking for the Arcane, word will get back to them and they will contact you in a short time. This means Wildjammer Helms are never hard to find if you know how to contact the Arcane.": "幸运的是，奥术师让你很容易就能找到他们。只要在任何一个球体的主要城市散布你要找的奥术师，消息就会传回他们那里，他们会在短时间内与你联系。这意味着，如果你知道如何与奥术师联系，野人头盔永远不难找到。",
	"As mentioned, there are helms beside Wildjammer Helms. Most of these are designed for specific types of ships or have limited functionality. This leads to most wildjammers making use of a Wildjammer Helm.": "如前所述，在Wildjammer Helms旁边还有一些舵机。其中大部分是为特定类型的船只设计的，或者功能有限。这就导致大多数野战舰艇都在使用野战舰舵。",
	"A species of highly secretive merchants, the Arcane are the only known distributors of Wildjammer Helms. Anyone who is aware of, wildjammers and wants to buy a Wildjammer Helm need only circulate around the rumor mill of a large city that they are looking for the Arcane. Usually within a week, they will have a secretive meeting with one of these blue giants.": "作为一个高度神秘的商人物种，奥术师是唯一已知的野蛮人头盔经销商。任何知道野蛮人并想购买野蛮人头盔的人，只需要在大城市的传言中流传他们正在寻找奥术师的消息。通常在一个星期内，他们就会与这些蓝色巨人中的一个进行秘密会面。",
	"As eager as the Arcane are to make deals, they are just as, protective of their status as the sole purveyors of Wildjammer Helms. Just about everyone who sails through wildspace and the flow has heard a story of some captain trying to sell a Wildjammer Helm they looted secondhand. The stories always end with a gruesome death at the hands of Arcane enforcers, They seem to have some type of ability to track Wildjammer Helms and know if someone is the licensed owner. Thanks to this combination of seemingly omnipotent knowledge of every helm and the severity of their enforcement, no black market has ever emerged.": "尽管奥术师们急于进行交易，但他们也同样保护自己作为野人头盔的唯一供应者的地位。几乎所有在荒野空间和水流中航行的人都听说过这样一个故事：一些船长试图出售他们掠夺来的二手野人头盔。这些故事总是以惨死在奥术执法者手中而告终，他们似乎有某种能力来追踪野人头盔，并知道某人是否是合法的主人。由于他们对每个头盔的了解似乎无所不能，再加上他们执法的严厉性，所以从来没有出现过黑市。",
	"If a captain does acquire a Wildjammer Helm that they wish to sell, the Arcane will pay 10% of the Wildjammer Helm's value as a finder's fee. Alternatively, they can transfer ownership of the helm to the captain for a fee of 10% of the helm's value.": "如果船长确实获得了他们想要出售的野战船舵，奥术师将支付野战船舵价值的10%作为发现者的费用。或者，他们也可以将舵的所有权转让给船长，但要支付舵的价值的10%。",
	"To make use of a helm, a spellcaster needs to meet the prerequisites to attune to the helm as shown on the item's description. Although this is an attunement, attuning to a Wildjammer Helm doesn't use up one of the character's attunement slots, it just takes a half- hour to become attuned.": "为了使用头盔，施法者需要满足物品描述中显示的与头盔相适应的前提条件。虽然这是一种调和，但调和野蛮人头盔并不占用人物的一个调和槽，只是需要半小时来调和。",
	"When a spellcaster becomes attuned to a Wildjammer Helm, they are treated as that ship's Helmsman. Their body is partially paralyzed, leaving them only control over their mouth and hands. In this state, they are unable to defend themselves from attack unless they first break attunement with the helm. Similarly, they are unable to get up from the helm until they break attunement with it by taking another half-hour. Due to this vulnerability while attuned to the helm, most wildjammers are designed with the helm in a highly defensible room.": "当一个施法者与野蛮人头盔相适应时，他们会被当作该船的舵手。他们的身体被部分麻痹，只剩下对嘴和手的控制。在这种状态下，他们无法保护自己免受攻击，除非他们首先打破与舵手的契合度。同样地，他们也无法从头盔上站起来，除非他们再花半个小时打破与头盔的契合。由于在与头盔相合时的这种脆弱性，大多数野蛮人都将头盔设计在一个高度可防御的房间里。",
	"Although the Helmsman loses a great deal of control over their own body, they gain considerable control over the ship, as if it was their body. Their senses are extended across the ship and can move it the same way they would start walking. Additionally, while attuned to the helm, the Helmsman is also able to deploy their senses to any spot on the wildjammer, as if they had an ethereal body to walk around with.": "虽然舵手失去了对自己身体的大量控制，但他们获得了对船的相当大的控制权，就好像它是他们的身体一样。他们的感官延伸到整个船上，可以像开始走路一样移动它。此外，在与舵手配合时，舵手还能将他们的感官部署到野战船上的任何地方，就像他们有一个空灵的身体可以走动一样。",
	"If a wildjammer ever has to make a saving throw or skill check, the Helmsman makes that roll with their own character's statistics.": "如果一个野蛮人需要做拯救动作或技能检查，舵手会用自己角色的统计数据来做这个测试。",
	"A Helmsman can stay attuned for up to 12 hours a day before they start risking exhaustion, as per the {@book Forced March rules (PHB, pg. 181)|phb|-1|forced march}. Attunement can be ended at any time, though some helms may have a backlash effect when you do.": "根据{@book Forced March rules (PHB, pg. 181)|phb|-1|forced march}的规定，舵手在开始有疲惫的风险之前，每天最多可以保持12小时的调整。驯服可以在任何时候结束，尽管有些头盔在你这样做的时候可能会有反作用力。",
	"There are two speeds we deal with in Wildjammer: tactical and jamming.": "我们在Wildjammer中处理的速度有两种：战术和干扰。",
	"When moving at tactical speed, a Helmsman and crew have considerable control over a wildjammer's movement. At this speed, the wildjammer could maneuver the ship up to a dock, near another wildjammer, approach a space anomaly, or engage in wildjammer combat. It is comparable to a creature's movement speed in combat.": "当以战术速度移动时，舵手和船员对野战船的移动有相当大的控制权。在这个速度下，野人可以操纵飞船到一个码头，靠近另一个野人，接近一个空间异常点，或者参与野人战斗。它与生物在战斗中的移动速度相当。",
	"In this system tactical speed is based on the stats of the wildjammer itself. Smaller wildjammers tend to move quicker and particularly heavy wildjammers tend to have lower speeds and require stronger helms to move them.": "在这个系统中，战术速度是基于野战船本身的属性。较小的野战船往往移动较快，而特别重的野战船往往有较低的速度，需要更强的舵手来移动它们。",
	"Tactical speed is useful when we want to maneuver or turn, but not so much when we want to cover the vast distances in space. For long distances, wildjammers will accelerate to jamming speeds by channeling magic in the helm for a minute. A wildjammer can't accelerate to jamming speed while in the gravity field of another mega scale object or mega creature.": "当我们想要机动或转向时，战术速度很有用，但当我们想要覆盖太空中的巨大距离时，就不那么有用了。对于长距离来说，野生干扰器会通过在舵手中引导魔法一分钟来加速到干扰速度。当处于另一个超大型物体或超大型生物的引力场中时，野人不能加速到干扰速度。",
	"When moving at jamming speed, the wildjammer always moves in a straight line and always at a speed of just over 4 million miles per hour. This means in a standard 12 hour traveling day for a Helmsman, the wildjammer can travel 50 million miles That's a little over half the distance from earth to the Sun. With two on alternating shifts, the ship travels 100 million miles per day, a bit over the distance from earth to the Sun.": "当以干扰速度移动时，Wildjammer总是在一条直线上移动，而且速度总是略高于每小时400万英里。这意味着在一个舵手的标准12小时旅行日中，Wildjammer可以行驶5000万英里，那是地球到太阳距离的一半多一点。如果两个人轮流值班，这艘船每天可以行驶1亿英里，比从地球到太阳的距离还要长一点。",
	"While in jamming speed, small debris is easily ignored. It's only when encountering an object on mega scale that jamming speeds fail. Should a wildjammer be traveling and get close to a mega creature, wildjammer, celestial body, or some other large object on mega scale, the wildjammer immediately slows to tactical speed. This sudden loss of speed isn't a detriment to anyone aboard, but it does mean the wildjammer has to maneuver around the obstacle and spend another minute charging the helm to accelerate back to jamming speeds.": "在干扰速度下，小碎片很容易被忽略。只有在遇到超大规模的物体时，干扰速度才会失效。如果一个野生动物正在旅行，并接近一个超大型生物、野生动物、天体或其他一些超大规模的物体，野生动物会立即减慢到战术速度。这种突然的速度损失对船上的任何人都没有坏处，但它确实意味着野战车必须绕过障碍物，再花一分钟给舵手充电，以加速回到干扰的速度。",
	"For the most part, traveling through the phlogiston is the same as traveling through wildspace: tactical for close range encounters and jamming for long distance. The main difference is that the phlogiston has what are called flow rivers. These flow rivers help guide wildjammers from one sphere to the next and speed them up beyond normal jamming speeds. A Helmsman is able to see these flow rivers and sail upon them from sphere to sphere.": "在大多数情况下，在phlogiston中旅行和在wildspace中旅行是一样的：近距离遭遇时是战术性的，远距离是干扰性的。主要的区别是Phlogiston有所谓的流动河流。这些河流帮助引导野生干扰器从一个球体到下一个球体，并使它们的速度超过正常干扰速度。舵手能够看到这些流动的河流，并在它们上面航行，从一个球体到另一个球体。",
	"From time to time, a wildjammer might want to take an aether current and travel down to a planet. On average, sailing ships tend to travel at about 4 miles per hour over water and air ships at 9 miles per hour through the air. Wildjammers can easily mimic these speeds to blend in, or they can use {@i Hover Sailing} to go faster. When hover sailing, a wildjammer can sail or fly a maximum number of miles per hour equal to five times the Helmsman's highest unexpended spell slot.  Although this method of travel is expedient, it isn't at all inconspicuous. If you happen to catch the eye of locals, they may decide to try and steal your ship.": "时不时地，一个野蛮人可能想乘着乙太流，下到一个星球。平均而言，帆船在水面上的行驶速度约为每小时4英里，航空船在空中的行驶速度为每小时9英里。野战船可以很容易地模仿这些速度来混入，或者他们可以使用（%0%）来更快。当悬停航行时，野蛮人可以每小时航行或飞行的最大里程数等于舵手最高未用法术槽的5倍。 虽然这种旅行方式很方便，但它一点也不显眼。如果你碰巧引起了当地人的注意，他们可能会决定尝试偷你的船。",
	"The mechanics of wildjammer combat I've discussed so far are all fairly simple. In the combat section, I talked about how mega scale encounters attempt to mimic ground scale combat as closely as possible.  Sadly, there is one mechanic that needs to be added that has no ground scale equivalent: maneuverability.": "到目前为止，我所讨论的野战战斗的机制都相当简单。在战斗部分，我谈到了巨型规模的遭遇战如何尽可能地模仿地面规模的战斗。 遗憾的是，有一个机制需要加入，它没有地面规模的对应物：可操作性。",
	"Generally speaking, maneuverability is the degree to which the wildjammer can turn while in motion. In ground scale combat, we're used to being able to move in any direction up to our speed. While controlling a ship in a mega scale encounter, we are limited in how much we can turn.": "一般来说，机动性是指野战车在运动中可以转向的程度。在地面战斗中，我们习惯于能够在任何方向上以我们的速度移动。而在超大规模的遭遇战中控制一艘船时，我们的转弯程度是有限的。",
	"Picture a ship sailing on the sea. If they wanted to turn around, could they pivot on the spot? Not really.  They could try doing some fancy maneuvers, but turning a large ship generally takes a bit of time and an arc in the path they sail.": "想象一下一艘在海上航行的船。如果他们想掉头，他们能当场转弯吗？并非如此。 他们可以尝试做一些花哨的动作，但转动一艘大船通常需要一些时间，而且在航行的路径上要有一个弧度。",
	"To deal with this mechanically, every wildjammer has a maneuverability score. This score can be 360°, 180°, 135°, 90°, 45°, and 0°. When a wildjammer moves, they can move up to their speed within a cone of movement equal to that maneuverability score.  After they move, they can then turn up to that many degrees left or right from the direction they are facing.": "为了在机械上处理这个问题，每台野战机都有一个可操作性分数。这个分数可以是360°，180°，135°，90°，45°，和0°。当一个野蛮人移动时，他们可以在与该可操作性分数相等的移动圆锥范围内移动到他们的速度。 在他们移动之后，他们可以从他们所面对的方向向左或向右转，最多可以转那么多度。",
	"For grid play, wildjammers can face up to 8 directions, corresponding with the four cardinal directions and four intercardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, & NW. Each of these is 45°. For example, if your ship's speed is 3,000 ft. (90°) and it is facing north, it can move 3,000 feet in a 90° cone, and then can turn up to 90° left or right, from north to east or from north to west.": "对于格子游戏，野球手最多可以面对8个方向，与四个红心方向和四个心间方向相对应。N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, & NW。每个方向都是45°。例如，如果你的船的速度是3000英尺（90°），它朝向北方，它可以在一个90°的圆锥体中移动3000英尺，然后可以向左或向右，从北到东或从北到西，最多转向90°。",
	"For those of you who play gridless or use hexes, use whatever works at your table! Just adjust these rules to take account of it. Hex play will probably be the toughest as this system is designed around grid or gridless to match up with normal fifth edition combat.": "对于那些玩无格子游戏或使用六边形的人来说，在你的桌子上使用任何可行的方法！只要调整这些规则就可以了。只需调整这些规则以考虑到它。六角形游戏可能是最困难的，因为这个系统是围绕网格或无网格设计的，以配合正常的第五版战斗。",
	"It's also worth noting that while a wildjammer is sailing at wildjammer speed, the crew do not need to actively work the sails because a wildjammer can't turn while at that speed. Crew still need to be standing by at the ready in case they get pulled out of jamming speed by something!": "同样值得注意的是，当一艘野战船以野战船的速度航行时，船员不需要积极地操作船帆，因为野战船在这个速度下不能转向。船员们仍然需要随时准备着，以防他们被什么东西拉出干扰速度。",
	"Although the propulsion of a wildjammer is primarily from the Helmsman, it is the crew working the sails that give the wildjammer its maneuverability. Every wildjammer has a minimum number of crew required, representing how many people it takes to properly work the sails. When your wildjammer has fewer than the minimum number of crew necessary, your ship's maneuverability is reduced based on the deficit. The degree of penalty is ultimately up to the DM discretion based on circumstance, but the below table can be used as a rough guideline for penalties.": "尽管野战船的推进力主要来自舵手，但正是由于船员们在帆上工作，才使野战船具有了可操作性。每艘野战船都有一个最低限度的船员人数要求，即需要多少人才能正确地操作船帆。当你的野战船的船员人数少于所需的最低人数时，你的船的机动性就会根据不足之处而减少。惩罚的程度最终由DM根据情况决定，但下表可以作为惩罚的一个粗略准则。",

Nevertheless, there are some shipwrights and enchanters that have worked together to build magical figureheads that provide boons to a ship. The magic of these figureheads is activated by the Helmsman on their turn.": "水手看到的大多数头像都是纯粹的装饰品，是加在船头的装饰品，只是为了美观。然而，也有一些船匠和魔法师共同建造了具有魔力的船头，为船只提供了福音。这些头像的魔法由舵手在他们的回合中激活。",
	"The hull of a wildjammer is the large frame which holds everything else. Hulls can be made of different materials, bringing about a variety of different style ships, though they can generally be clumped into families based on the shape of the hull.": "野战船的船体是容纳其他一切的大框架。船体可以由不同的材料制成，带来各种不同风格的船只，尽管它们通常可以根据船体的形状被归纳为不同的家族。",
	"In this section, I'm going to start by going over the different figures you'll see when looking at a wildjammer's stat block. In normal fifth edition terms, this is the section where | explain hit points, armor class, movement speed, and the like. After that, we'll dig right into the wildjammers themselves, with a long list of wildjammers organized by size and value.": "在这一节中，我将首先介绍一下当你看到一个野人的状态块时，你会看到的不同数据。用第五版的术语来说，这部分是解释命中率、护甲等级、移动速度等的地方。之后，我们将直接讨论野战车本身，并按尺寸和价值列出一长串野战车的清单。",
	"Just like the ships from the Age of Sail, wildjammers tend to have a lot of unique character to each of them.  While there are many commonalities from one to another, people generally like to vary it a bit. Even two wildjammers crafted in the same place will tend to have slight variations in room layout and overall form.  That said, there are some general attributes that wildjammers tend to have.": "就像航海时代的船只一样，野战船往往有很多独特的特征。 虽然有许多共同点，但人们通常喜欢有一些变化。即使是在同一个地方制作的两艘野战船，在房间布局和整体形式上也会有轻微的变化。 这就是说，有一些一般的属性，野人往往有。",
	"Armor Class is treated identically to how you are used to it from D&D 5e. Attacks that meet or beat the Armor Class of a wildjammer hit.": "装甲等级的处理方式与你在D&D 5e中所习惯的方式相同。符合或超过野蛮人装甲等级的攻击会被击中。",
	"Hull Points is the short-hand name we use for mega hit points with regards to wildjammers. Each mega hit point/hull point represents 100 regular hit points.  When a wildjammer's hull points reach 0, the wildjammer loses its structural integrity and breaks apart. The air bubble remains behind, so survivors do have time to either be picked up or get to safety.": "船体点数是我们对巨型命中率的简称，与野战军有关。每一个巨型打击点/船体点代表100个普通打击点。 当野战车的车体点数达到0时，野战车就会失去其结构的完整性并解体。气泡仍在后面，所以幸存者确实有时间被接走或到达安全地带。",
	"Repairing hull points isn't a quick process. Once per day, the Boatswain can roll a DC 15 Intelligence (carpenter's tools) check. On a success, they can repair the ship's hull or any damaged modules, ship weapons, sails, etc. for a total number of hull points equal to ten times their proficiency bonus. On a failure, they repair a half as many hull points. Only one check can be made to repair either the hull, a module, or the sails each day.": "修复船体点并不是一个快速的过程。每天一次，船工可以掷出DC15智力（木匠工具）检查。如果成功，他们可以修复船体或任何损坏的模块、船上的武器、船帆等，修复的船体点数等于他们熟练度加成的10倍。失败时，他们只能修复一半的船体点数。每天只能做一次检查来修复船体、模块或船帆。",
	"In fifth edition, ships generally shrug off damage through the damage threshold stat. In Wildjammer, we forgo the use of damage threshold in favor of a new mechanic called {@b Bulwark Points (BP)}. Bulwark points represent the same basic idea, but instead of simply ignoring small amounts of damage, this represents a buffer that can be easily repaired. In mechanical terms, bulwark points are like temporary hit points: whenever an attack hits the wildjammer, damage is first dealt to the ship's bulwark points.": "在第五版中，船只通常通过伤害阈值统计来摆脱伤害。在《荒野大镖客》中，我们放弃了伤害阈值的使用，而采用了一种叫做（%0%）的新机制。堡垒点代表了同样的基本理念，但它不是简单地忽略少量的伤害，而是代表了一个可以轻松修复的缓冲区。在机械术语中，防波堤点就像临时的命中率：每当攻击击中野战舰时，伤害首先会对舰船的防波堤点造成伤害。",
	"While hull points take a good bit of time to repair, bulwark points are regularly replenished when the wildjammer has someone acting as the boatswain. See the section on wildjammer combat for more (pg. 72).": "虽然船体点数需要很长时间来修复，但当野战军有人充当船夫时，防波堤点数会定期得到补充。更多内容请参见野战军作战一节（第72页）。",
	"See the Speeds section (pg. 31) for more information. Speed is made up of two values, a movement speed and a maneuverability score. The speed of a ship is largely based on the ship's design, weight, and the way the helm converts magical power from the Helmsman into propulsion. If a ship has no Helmsman, the ship's speed is reduced to 0 ft.": "更多信息请参见速度部分（第31页）。速度是由两个数值组成的，一个是移动速度，一个是机动性得分。船只的速度主要基于船只的设计、重量以及舵手将来自舵手的魔法力量转化为推进力的方式。如果一艘船没有舵手，那么这艘船的速度就会降低到0英尺。",
	"Similarly, maneuverability is based on a ship's sails and the crew working them. If a ship's sails become disabled, the ship's maneuverability drops to 0°, and if the ship has too few crew, penalties can be applied. See the Interaction With Crew section (pg. 32) for more.": "同样的，机动性也是基于船只的风帆和操作风帆的船员。如果一艘船的船帆失效，该船的机动性就会下降到0°，如果该船的船员太少，就会受到惩罚。更多内容请参见与船员的互动部分（第32页）。",
	"Some wildjammers will have upgrades or features that grant them additional movement speed or abilities that help them move around the battlefield.": "一些野战部队会有升级或功能，赋予他们额外的移动速度或能力，帮助他们在战场上移动。",
	"Hardpoints represent the number of slots available for siege weaponry onboard your wildjammer, as well as their facing.  A weapon can be affixed to a hardpoint with any facing, but if the weapon is fixed, it can only fire in a 90° angle once it is installed. Some hardpoint positions on a wildjammer add the fixed property to weapons mounted there.": "硬点代表了你的野战坦克上可用于攻城武器的槽位数量，以及它们的方向。 一件武器可以被安装在任何方向的硬点上，但如果武器是固定的，一旦被安装，它只能以90°的角度发射。野战车上的一些硬点位置为安装在那里的武器增加了固定属性。",
	"There are 3 sizes of hardpoints that can exist on a wildjammer: small, medium, and large. A ship mounted weapon can fit on a hardpoint of the same size or greater. So a Light Catapult (small) can be installed on a small, medium, or large hardpoint, but a Heavy Catapult (large) can only be installed on a large hardpoint.": "在野战舰上可以存在3种尺寸的硬点：小、中、大。舰载武器可以安装在相同大小或更大的硬点上。因此，轻型弹射器（小型）可以安装在小型、中型或大型硬点上，但重型弹射器（大型）只能安装在大型硬点上。",
	"This represents how many people are needed at minimum to operate the sails and keep the ship moving. This number doesn't include the crew requirement for operating ship mounted weapons.": "这代表了至少需要多少人去操作船帆和保持船的移动。这个数字不包括操作舰载武器的船员需求。",
	"Crew above the minimum isn't essential, though if you lose crew members while sailing through space, your ships maneuverability will suffer. Refer to the table \"Crew Deficit\" on page 32 to determine your wildjammer's maneuverability when it has less than the minimum crew available.": "超过最低限度的船员并不重要，但如果你在太空中航行时失去了船员，你的飞船的机动性将受到影响。请参考第32页的 \"船员不足 \"表，以确定你的野战船在可用船员少于最低限度时的机动性。",
	"A wildjammer with no crew has no maneuverability and can only turn in big, clumsy arcs. With regards to tactical speed, the wildjammer can't turn in combat.  Nevertheless, if it has enough time, it can make turns and slowly drag itself back to a port for a new crew and likely some much needed repairs.": "没有船员的野战车没有机动性，只能以大而笨拙的弧线转向。在战术速度方面，野战船不能在战斗中转向。 然而，如果它有足够的时间，它可以转弯，慢慢地把自己拖回港口，换上新的船员，并可能进行一些急需的修理。",
	"Wildjammers come in many different sizes, but based on ground scale, they would all be gargantuan. Since that doesn't help us all that much, this supplement uses an alternate breakdown of sizes similar to that of ground scale, just the mega equivalent. The names have been changed to match some Age of Sail terminology, but they are all ultimately just mega + ground equivalent size.": "野蛮人有许多不同的尺寸，但根据地面比例，他们都是巨无霸。由于这对我们帮助不大，本补充资料采用了与地面比例相似的另一种尺寸分类，只是用巨型当量。名称已经改变，以符合《风帆时代》的一些术语，但它们最终都只是巨型+地面等效尺寸。",

	"Gargantuan": "巨大的",
	"Ship of the Line": "航线上的船只",
	"Cargo hold is simply a measure of how much available room there is on the wildjammer. This can be used for transporting trade goods between planets and spheres, carrying large sums of loot, or as temporary shelter for people who need help getting somewhere else.": "货舱只是衡量野战船上有多少可用空间。它可以用来在行星和球体之间运输贸易货物，携带大量的战利品，或者作为需要帮助的人去其他地方的临时住所。",
	"All wildjammers come with a pantry that can support the maximum crew count of the ship for 3 months without taking up cargo space.": "所有的野战船都配有一个茶水间，可以在不占用货物空间的情况下支持该船的最大船员数3个月。",
	"If you're going on a long voyage though, you may want to stock up! Every 1 ton of cargo storage you fill with food and water can provide 2,400 days of sustenance for 1 person. Divide 2,400 by the number of people you have to supply for and you'll have the number of days 1 ton can sustain.": "如果你要进行长期的航行，你可能会想储存起来! 你每装满1吨食物和水的货物仓库可以为一个人提供2400天的营养。用2400除以你需要供应的人数，你就可以得到1吨可以维持的天数。",
	"The cost of food and water is included in the daily cost of crew members to make food and water management simple. If you add passengers or stock up, the cost of food and water is 5 silver per per person per day, or 1,200gp for 1 ton.": "食物和水的费用包含在船员的日常费用中，使食物和水的管理变得简单。如果你增加乘客或囤积，食物和水的成本是每人每天5银，或1吨1,200gp。",
	"This refers to the number of days of fresh air a ship can sustain a single person. If a wildjammer has 600 days of fresh air in its air bubble, it can sustain a single person for 600 days before the air becomes fouled, and then 600 more days before it becomes lethal.": "这指的是一艘船可以维持一个人的新鲜空气的天数。如果一艘野战船的空气泡里有600天的新鲜空气，那么在空气变得污浊之前，它可以维持一个人600天，然后在变得致命之前再维持600天。",
	"Most wildjammers have crews with more than a single person, meaning you will need to do just a tiny bit of math. Simply divide the total days of fresh air by the number of people aboard, and you'll get how many days it can sustain that crew.": "大多数野战船的船员都不止一个人，这意味着你只需要做一点小小的计算。只要把新鲜空气的总天数除以船上的人数，你就会得到它能维持该船员的天数。",
	"For example, lets say we have a ship with 10 people on it and the ship's air bubble has 600 days of fresh air. We would take 600, divide it by 10, and get 60. So this should has enough air to sustain people for 60 days before going foul, and then for 60 more days before becoming lethal.": "例如，假设我们有一艘船上有10个人，船上的空气泡有600天的新鲜空气。我们取600，除以10，得到60。因此，这应该有足够的空气来维持人们60天的生命，然后再有60天的生命，然后再变得致命。",
	"Creatures that leave a wildjammer air bubble carry 1 minute worth of air with them. This air fouls after a minute. A minute after that, a character can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).": "离开野蛮人气泡的生物会携带1分钟的空气。这种空气在一分钟后就会污浊。一分钟后，角色可以屏住呼吸，时间等于他们的体质修正值（最少30秒）。",
	"While all wildjammers are designed to operate when sailing through space, their ability to function on a planet can be somewhat limited depending on the model. All wildjammers are capable of hover sailing which allows them to either fly like an airship or skim the surface of water at exceptional speeds, but not all of them can actually touch down on a planet safely without a Helmsman remaining attuned to the helm to keep it hovering above the surface.": "虽然所有的野战船都是为了在太空中航行而设计的，但它们在星球上的运作能力可能会受到一定的限制，这取决于模型的不同。所有的野战船都能够进行悬停航行，这使它们能够像飞艇一样飞行，或者以超常的速度滑过水面，但并不是所有的野战船都能够在没有舵手保持舵手的情况下安全地在行星上着陆。",
	"If a wildjammer shows that it is able to land in water, that means that the wildjammer can both land and sail in water. A ship that can land on land has landing gear that can keep the ship's hull from touching down fully, like the wheels of a plane.": "如果一艘野战船显示它能在水中登陆，那就意味着这艘野战船既能在水中登陆也能在水中航行。能在陆地上登陆的船有起落架，可以使船体不完全着地，就像飞机的轮子一样。",
	"Most wildjammer crews will do their best to avoid contact with groundling civilization. There are more than a few tales of a group of groundlings stealing a wildjammer from an unwary crew. The best way to avoid that fate is to go without anyone knowing what you have. Remember, a wildjammer is a valuable magic item, and there are many who would like to have it for themselves.": "大多数野人船员会尽力避免与地面人的文明接触。一群地面人从不知情的船员手中偷走野战车的故事不只一次。避免这种命运的最好办法是在没有人知道你有什么的情况下出发。请记住，野战锤是一件有价值的魔法物品，有很多人想把它据为己有。",
	"Luckily, most ships that can land on water and sail through water are built to look like regular ships, just with exotic design. Such ships may catch some eyes, but they are usually inconspicuous enough to pull into harbor safely.": "幸运的是，大多数能在水面上登陆和在水中航行的船只都被建造得像普通船只，只是有异国情调的设计。这样的船可能会吸引一些人的眼球，但它们通常不显眼，可以安全地驶入港口。",
	"Wildjammers are not generally mass produced in a factory. You're unlikely to find automated production lines crafting hulls, ship mounted weapons, or modules in one of the many jamming port cities.  The vast majority of wildjammers were, at some point or another, crafted by a person or group of people who have their own personal preferences, goals for the wildjammer, and/or artistic vision. Like the creations of shipwrights during the Age of Sail, each wildjammer carries the unique signature of the person or people who originally crafted it.": "野生干扰器一般不在工厂里大规模生产。你不可能在众多干扰港口城市中找到制作船体、舰载武器或模块的自动化生产线。 绝大多数的野战舰在某种程度上是由一个人或一群人制作的，他们有自己的个人喜好，野战舰的目标，和/或艺术眼光。就像航海时代的船匠的作品一样，每个野战船都带有最初制作它的人的独特签名。",
	"That said, we can generally categorize wildjammers into types based on similar aesthetic style or design philosophy. Think of this as a picture that we show two different artists and ask them to reproduce. Each of those artists will bring their own unique flavor and style to it, resulting in two variations of the same original picture.": "也就是说，我们一般可以根据类似的审美风格或设计理念，将野战机分为不同的类型。想想看，这就像我们给两个不同的艺术家看一张图片，并要求他们进行复制。每一个艺术家都会带来他们自己独特的味道和风格，从而形成同一张原始图片的两种变化。",
	"In this section, I'm going to talk about these types and offer a starting stat block for NPC wildjammers or as a starting point for PC wildjammers. All of these stat blocks are generalized and each will vary based on the shipwright that created it. Weapons may vary from those shown on the stat block and attack bonuses definitely vary based on the character using them in wildjammer combat.": "在本节中，我将讨论这些类型，并为NPC野战船提供一个起始状态块，或者作为PC野战船的起点。所有这些状态块都是概括性的，每个状态块都会根据创建它的船工而有所不同。武器可能与状态块上显示的不同，攻击奖励也肯定会根据在野战中使用这些武器的角色而有所不同。",
	"As you look through this section and you see wildjammers like the Hammership, remember that just because it appears to be made of wood doesn't mean it has to be. Imagine if the party puts in a work order for a Hammership with a dwarven shipwright.  That wildjammer might end up being created out of metal instead of wood, resulting in more AC but slower movement speed. Imagine if the party puts in a work order for a Hammership with an elven shipwright. That elf might grow the wildjammer from the starfly plant, making the ship more maneuverable than it normally would be but less heavily armored.": "当你看完这一节，看到像铁锤船这样的野战船时，请记住，仅仅因为它看起来是木头做的，并不意味着它必须是木头。想象一下，如果党派向矮人船匠提交了一个锤子船的工作订单。 那艘野战船最终可能是用金属而不是木头制造的，从而导致更多的交流，但移动速度较慢。想象一下，如果党派为锤子船向精灵船匠下达了工作指令。那位精灵可能会从星空植物中培育出野战锤，使这艘船的机动性比正常情况下更强，但装甲更少。",

Perhaps your party comes across a group of derelict Spirit Warriors and form a bond with them. Instead, maybe they are part of the Elven Imperial Navy and are trying to earn the prestige of becoming one with a Spirit Warrior.

	"When the Spirit Warrior has to make an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, the bonded warrior makes the check instead.": "当精神战士需要进行能力检查、蓄力投掷或攻击卷时，绑定的战士会代替他进行检查。",
	"When the bonded warrior makes use of a class feature, the Spirit Warrior amplifies it up to mega scale. For example, a Fighter's Second Wind feature will recover mega hit points instead of regular hit points to the Spirit Warrior. A spellcaster's spells will have their range and covered area multiplied by 100 and their damage converted to mega damage.": "当绑定的战士使用一个等级特征时，精神战士会将其放大到超大规模。例如，战士的 \"第二风 \"功能将恢复巨量的命中率，而不是普通的命中率给灵武者。一个施法者的法术范围和覆盖区域将乘以100，其伤害也将转换为巨额伤害。",
	"As you can see, in this kind of a game the Spirit Warrior is significantly enhanced to translate a player character's strengths and weaknesses into mega scale. The main thing that the Spirit Warrior doesn't do is translate the benefits of magical items. If a player character normally has 50 hit points, but wears a magic item to bring them up to 75 hit points, the Spirit Warrior has 50 mega hit points because the Spirit Warrior isn't wearing the item.": "正如你所看到的，在这种游戏中，精神战士被大大加强，将玩家角色的优势和劣势转化为超大规模。精神战士不做的主要事情是转化魔法物品的好处。如果一个玩家角色通常有50点命中率，但穿上一件魔法物品使其达到75点命中率，那么精神战士就有50点巨额命中率，因为精神战士没有穿上这个物品。",
	"That said, part of the fun of having a Spirit Warrior is being able to customize it! Not only the cosmetic appearance of the Spirit Warrior, but its equipment too. DMs can provide any item they would normally give a player character, just scaled up to mega scale for the Spirit Warrior. Heck, a DM can even start making more wild and fun magic items that don't make sense for a player character's small size!": "也就是说，拥有精神战士的部分乐趣在于能够定制它！不仅是精神战士的外观，还有其装备。不仅是精神战士的外观，还有它的装备。管理员可以提供任何他们通常会给玩家角色的物品，只是将其放大到精神战士的巨大规模。糟糕的是，管理员甚至可以开始制作更多野生和有趣的魔法物品，这些物品对于玩家角色的小尺寸来说是没有意义的。",
	"Spirit Warriors can't travel at jamming speeds. They are limited to the movement their body provides for them through the bond with their warrior. As a result, most Spirit Warriors will find themselves aboard a wildjammer with most or all of its cargo storage devoted to fighter bays for the Spirit Warriors to land and be worked on. This carrier can travel at jamming speeds to move the player characters around, but when combat starts, Seep lye characters all deploy in their Spirit Warriors to fight whatever threatens the ship. This is still space combat, but it works pretty much identically to normal combat.": "精神战士不能以干扰的速度旅行。他们被限制在他们的身体通过与战士的联系为他们提供的运动。因此，大多数精神战士会发现自己在一艘野战船上，它的大部分或全部货物存储都是供精神战士降落和工作的战斗机舱。这艘航母可以以干扰的速度移动玩家角色，但当战斗开始时，Seep lye角色都会部署他们的精神战士，与任何威胁这艘船的东西战斗。这仍然是太空战斗，但它的工作原理与正常战斗基本相同。",
	"If a group of Spirit Warriors are particularly close and the situation demands it, a group of three to five can unite and merge into a single Spirit Warrior called a Zwarth.

	"Starting the following round, the Zwarth and all its bonded warriors act on the same turn based on the highest initiative roll among them. The Zwarth can only move once, but each bonded warrior can use their action to attack with the Zwarth's weapons or cast spells they know using the Zwarth.": "从下一回合开始，侏儒和它的所有绑定的战士在同一回合内根据他们中最高的主动权卷轴采取行动。矮人只能移动一次，但每个结义武士可以用他们的行动来使用矮人的武器进行攻击，或者用矮人施展他们知道的法术。",
	"The Zwarth expires and breaks into its constituent Spirit Warriors after 8 hours, when any constituent Spirit Warrior chooses to end it early, or when the Zwarth is reduced to 0 mega hit points. If it is reduced to 0 mega hit points, it breaks apart and each Spirit Warrior is reduced to 0 mega hit points. A Spirit Warrior that has been in a Zwarth can't join another for 30 days due to the strain it causes.": "8小时后，当任何一个成员的精神战士选择提前结束它，或者当Zwarth被降低到0兆分时，Zwarth就会失效并分解成它的成员精神战士。如果它被降低到0兆点，它就会分裂，每个精神战士都被降低到0兆点。一个已经加入Zwarth的精神战士在30天内不能再加入另一个Zwarth，因为它会造成压力。",
	"Running a Spirit Warrior game is not unlike running a normal D&D adventure. Since the Spirit Warrior translates a character's skills into mega scale, the only thing that varies is equipment and magic items. As such, balancing a Spirit Warrior game is going to be much like balancing any other D&D game.": "运行一个精神战士游戏与运行一个正常的D&D冒险没有什么不同。由于精神战士将角色的技能转化为巨大的规模，唯一不同的是装备和魔法物品。因此，平衡精神战士游戏与平衡任何其他D&D游戏一样。",
	"This game mode does put the onus of equipment building on you. You can handle this easily by just treating any normal magic item as a mega version for the Spirit Warrior. You can also choose to get more creative and relish in the clear anime influences in this style of game and let things get ridiculous and silly while in the Spirit Warriors.": "这个游戏模式确实把装备建造的责任放在你身上。你可以通过把任何普通的魔法物品当作精神战士的巨型版本来轻松处理。你也可以选择变得更有创意，并在这种游戏风格中津津乐道于明显的动漫影响，让事情变得荒唐和愚蠢，而在精神勇士中。",

	"Although there are many interesting wildjammers provided in this book, a party might like to design their own. While DMs could and should feel free to use their balancing intuition, in this section we'll be going through a process that a DM or the party can follow to design their own wildjammer!": "尽管本书中提供了许多有趣的野战游戏，但聚会可能会喜欢设计他们自己的。虽然管理员可以而且应该自由地使用他们的平衡直觉，但在本节中，我们将通过一个过程，让管理员或聚会可以按照这个过程来设计他们自己的野战游戏",
	"It would be advantageous to read through this entire section first before starting to build your own ship. It will likely be easier the second time through!": "在开始建造你自己的船之前，先读完这一节是有好处的。第二次阅读时可能会更容易一些",
	"To begin, we start with a generic ship template with AC 10 and a speed of 3,000 (90°). As we go through the following steps and you make your choices, you will make changes to these values.": "首先，我们从一个通用的船舶模板开始，AC为10，速度为3,000（90°）。当我们通过下面的步骤和你做出选择时，你将对这些数值进行修改。",
	"Please note that this assumes your ship is being built for space travel. Ships designed by groundlings for naval travel suffer a -45° maneuverability penalty.": "请注意，这是假设你的飞船是为太空旅行而建造的。地面人设计的用于海上航行的飞船会受到-45度的机动性惩罚。",
	"The first thing we need to do is decide how big the ship is going to be. A larger ship tends to have better AC, HP, BP, cargo storage, and hardpoints, but they are slower and more expensive.": "我们需要做的第一件事是决定这艘船要有多大。一艘大船往往有更好的AC、HP、BP、货物存储和硬点，但它们的速度更慢，价格更贵。",
	"Start by choosing a hull size, any size between 10 and 100. The higher this number, the bigger the ship, and also the more expensive. See the Hull Sizes Table below and modify the generic ship with the values in the AC, speed, and maneuverability columns.": "首先选择一个船体大小，在10到100之间的任何大小。这个数字越大，船就越大，也就越贵。请看下面的船体尺寸表，用AC、速度和机动性一栏中的数值修改通用船。",
	"Schooner (1x1)": "帆船 (1x1)",
	"Sloop (1x1)": "单桅帆船 (1x1)",

	"Heavy Frigate (3x3)": "重型护卫舰 (3x3)",
	"Ship of the Line (4x4)": "舰艇 (4x4)",
	"To calculate your ship's hull points, multiply the ship's tonnage by 3.5, round down, then add 40 to the result.": "要计算你的船只的船体点数，将船只的吨位乘以3.5，四舍五入，然后在结果中加上40。",
	"For example: If your ship has a tonnage of 38, that's 38 x 3.5 = 133. Add 40 for a total of 173 hull points.": "比如说。如果你的船的吨位是38，那就是38 x 3.5 = 133。再加上40，总共是173个船体点。",
	"To calculate your ship's bulwark points, divide the hull points by 10 and round to the nearest even whole number. In this example, 173 / 10 = 17.3. We then round to 18. This ship has 18 bulwark points.": "要计算你的船的防波堤点数，要用船体点数除以10，然后四舍五入到最接近的偶数整数。在这个例子中，173/10=17.3。然后我们四舍五入到18。这艘船有18个防波堤点数。",
	"Your wildjammer can be made out of a wide variety of different materials. Choose an option from the Hull Materials table below. This will modify your ship's AC, speed, and maneuverability. It will also determine the cost per ton for the hull.": "你的野战船可以由各种不同的材料制成。从下面的船体材料表中选择一个选项。这将改变你的船的交流、速度和可操作性。它也将决定每吨船体的成本。",
	"Please note that not all materials listed here are easily found on the market. For example, elves enviously guard the rituals for growing plant based ships. They are listed for for situations where the characters have earned the ability to buy them.": "请注意，这里列出的材料并非都能在市场上轻易找到。例如，精灵们羡慕地守护着种植植物性船只的仪式。它们是为人物赢得购买能力的情况而列出的。",
	"Next we do some quick and easy calculations.": "接下来我们做一些快速而简单的计算。",
	"{@b Cargo Hold} is equal to half your ship's tonnage, rounded down.": "{@b Cargo Hold}等于你的船的吨位的一半，向下取整。",
	"{@b Crew (Min)} is equal to 1/3 of your ship's tonnage, rounded down.  + Crew (Max) is equal to your ship's tonnage.": "{@b Crew (Min)}等于你的船的吨位的1/3，向下取整。 +船员（最大）等于你的船的吨位。",
	"{@b Days of Air} is equal to your ship's Crew (Max) multiplied by 100.": "{@b Days of Air}等于你船上的船员(Max)乘以100。",
	"For example, our 38 ton ship has a cargo hold of 19 tons. It has a minimum crew required equal to 12, and a maximum crew of 38. It has 3,800 days of air.": "例如，我们38吨的船有一个19吨的货舱。它所需的最小船员等于12人，最大船员为38人。它有3,800天的空气。",
	"Many ships are designed with a modifier that further adjusts the hull's statistics. This is optional and it can only be applied at ship construction. Adding one of these options increases the cost of the hull by 10%. Choose {@b one} from the list below.": "许多船只在设计时都有一个修改器，可以进一步调整船体的统计数据。这是可选的，它只能在船舶建造时应用。添加这些选项之一会使船体的成本增加10%。从下面的列表中选择（%0%）。",
	"In most cases, you'll want to use a {@item Wildjammer Helm (Minor)|wjmais|Wildjammer Helm}. If your ship is a Heavy Frigate or Ship of the Line sized ship, you will need to use a {@item Wildjammer Helm (Major)|wjmais}. If you already own a {@i Wildjammer Helm}, a member of the Arcane will transfer it and license it to this new ship for a modest 10,000gp fee.": "在大多数情况下，你会想使用{@item Wildjammer Helm (Minor)|wjmais|Wildjammer Helm}。如果你的船是一艘重型护卫舰或军舰大小的船，你将需要使用{@item Wildjammer Helm (Major)|wjmais}。如果你已经拥有一艘{@i Wildjammer Helm}，凯旋门的成员会将其转让并授权给这艘新船，费用不高，10,000gp。",
	"If you have acquired a helm that you want to use in lieu of a {@i Wildjammer Helm}, a shipwright will usually install it. Consult with your DM.": "如果你获得了一个你想用来代替{@i Wildjammer Helm}的舵，通常会有一个船工来安装它。请咨询你的DM。",
	"Both this and the next step require DM input. The number of hardpoints on a ship varies considerably based on the ship's overall design.": "这一步和下一步都需要DM的投入。舰艇上的硬点数量根据舰艇的整体设计而有很大的不同。",
	"Consider the Clipper. The Clipper is a ship with a crew (min/max) of 18/65. It also has a whopping 26 medium hardpoints, usually with a 12-pounder long gun that needs 4 crew each. This means that to use the guns, the Clipper needs 104 crew members. This is a poorly designed ship, but it works for the giff because they are willing to deal with the unfortunate living conditions if it means more guns.": "考虑一下Clipper号。快艇是一艘拥有18/65名船员（最小/最大）的船。它还有一个惊人的26个中型硬点，通常有一门12磅的长炮，每门需要4名船员。这意味着，为了使用这些火炮，Clipper号需要104名船员。这是一艘设计很差的船，但它对吉夫来说是可行的，因为如果这意味着更多的枪支，他们愿意处理不幸的生活条件。",
	"Now consider the Hammership. The Hammership has a crew (ruin/mar) of 24/60. The ship has 3 large hardpoints, usually for 24-pounder cannons, each of which require 6 crew to operate. That means to use each of these guns, the ship needs 18 crew. In total, that's 42 crew to operate the sails and guns, with 18 in reserve should any crew meet an unfortunate end or otherwise be incapacitated. This ship makes sense.": "现在考虑Hammership。锤子船有24/60名船员（废墟/海洋）。该船有3个大的硬点，通常用于24磅大炮，每个硬点需要6名船员来操作。这意味着为了使用这些大炮，该船需要18名船员。总的来说，有42名船员来操作风帆和火炮，如果有船员不幸遇难或丧失能力，还有18名后备船员。这艘船是有意义的。",
	"With that in mind, there are some general rules to follow when assigning the number of hardpoints for a reasonably designed wildjammer. See the Hardpoint Table below for the maximum hardpoint size and number of hardpoints by ship size.": "考虑到这一点，在为设计合理的野战舰分配硬点数量时，有一些一般规则可以遵循。请看下面的硬点表，以了解最大的硬点尺寸和按船型划分的硬点数量。",
	"Remember, these are guidelines. Many of the ships in this document break them!": "记住，这些是指导方针。本文件中的许多船只都违反了这些准则",
	"Assigning ship features is another step that requires DM input. Features are meant to represent the things that the ship is good at. A quick and agile ship might have a feature like Evasive, allowing it to move in any direction when the Helmsman uses the Evasive Maneuvers bridge crew action. It wouldn't make much sense for the massive and clunky Whaleship to have that same feature.": "指派船舶特征是另一个需要DM输入的步骤。功能是为了代表该船擅长的事情。一艘快速灵活的船可能会有一个像 \"回避 \"这样的功能，当舵手使用 \"回避机动 \"的舰桥动作时，它可以向任何方向移动。对于庞大而笨重的鲸鱼船来说，拥有同样的功能就没有什么意义了。",
	"Just like with weapons, I can only offer guidelines to help DMs in assigning features to a new ship. See the Features Table for a rough estimate of how many features a ship should have based on its tonnage.": "就像武器一样，我只能提供一些准则来帮助管理员为新船分配功能。请看特征表，以粗略估计一艘船根据其吨位应该有多少特征。",
	"When a ship is being built, it can forego installing a fore mantle in exchange for 1 additional ship feature in addition to the number shown on the table below.": "当一艘船正在建造时，它可以放弃安装前幔，以换取除下表所示数量之外的1个额外的船舶特征。",
	"In addition to assigning features, the DM must also assign landing gear. This is largely based on the ship's aesthetic. Does it have legs? It lands on the ground just fine. Is it shaped like a boat? It can land in water just fine. Use your best judgment based on the design.": "除了分配特征外，DM还必须分配起落架。这主要是基于飞船的审美。它有腿吗？它可以很好地降落在地面上。它的形状像船吗？它就可以在水中降落。根据设计，使用你的最佳判断。",
	"Now that you've mapped out your ship, you'll pay the shipwright based on the cost per ton multiplied by the ship's tonnage. Construction takes a number of days equal to the ship's tonnage. You can also purchase modules, upgrades, fore mantle equipment, and ship weapons directly from the shipwright to have them installed during construction and save some time. Once your ship is done, you'll want to gather the crew for a naming ceremony. It's bad luck to deploy a ship on its maiden voyage without a name! This is the perfect opportunity for a fun roleplay heavy scene!": "现在你已经画出了你的船，你将根据每吨的成本乘以船的吨位来支付造船师。建造需要的天数与船的吨位相等。你也可以直接向造船师购买模块、升级、前舱设备和舰船武器，以便在建造过程中安装它们，节省一些时间。一旦你的船完成了，你要召集船员举行命名仪式。在首航中部署一艘没有名字的船是很不吉利的！这是个很好的机会，可以让大家一起玩耍。这是一个有趣的角色扮演场景的完美机会!",
	"Wildspace is largely untamed. Much like sailing on the open seas or traveling between towns in the old west, there are no police that can help you outside of major cities. This means a well prepared wildjammer must be able to protect itself on a journey through wildspace.": "野生空间在很大程度上是未被驯服的。就像在公海上航行或在旧西部的城镇之间旅行一样，在主要城市之外没有警察可以帮助你。这意味着，一个准备充分的野营者必须能够在穿越荒野空间的旅程中保护自己。",
	"In this section, we'll be going over how wildjammers protect themselves against the other ships and the gargantuan mega creatures that live in wildspace. The ship combat system presented here is an adaptation of the ship combat system Mage Hand Press designed for their Dark Matter campaign setting. This system is not compatible with the ship combat system presented in the official D&D 5e books. The goal of this system is to make the ship feel more like a tool the party uses and gets better at as they level up, similar to getting better with a weapon or at casting spells.": "在这一节中，我们将讨论野战船如何保护自己，以对抗其他船只和生活在荒野空间的巨型生物。这里介绍的飞船战斗系统是法师之手出版社为他们的《暗物质》战役设定设计的飞船战斗系统的改编。这个系统与D&D 5e官方书籍中的飞船战斗系统不兼容。这个系统的目标是使飞船更像是一方使用的工具，并且随着他们等级的提高而变得更好，类似于在武器或施法方面变得更好。",
	"That said, you {@b do not need to use ship combat in a Wildjammer game}. This section is entirely optional. Many DMs are completely fine with using the party's ship as a narrative tool for conveying the party around to different locations, to act as a central base, and even as a recurring battlemap with monsters attacking the party on the ship itself. That said, you may be a DM who wants your party to encounter monsters like a space kraken or a D&D version of Charybdis & Scylla. This system is for those DMs.": "也就是说，你（%0%）。这一部分完全是可选的。许多DM完全可以把派对的飞船作为一种叙事工具，用来把派对输送到不同的地点，作为一个中央基地，甚至作为一个反复出现的战斗地图，让怪物在飞船上攻击派对本身。也就是说，你可能是一个希望你的队伍遇到像空间海怪或D&D版的卡律布迪斯和斯库拉这样的怪物的DM。这个系统就是为这些DM设计的。",
	"As you've read through this supplement, you've likely seen the word mega come up a lot. In Wildjammer, you can run combat in either ground scale or mega scale. Ground scale is the scale that you're likely already familiar with from playing D&D 5e. Mega scale is the scale in which ship combat takes place. If this book refers to something as mega, it means that something is only applicable to ship scale combat. For example, ships have mega hit points, also called hull points, and they deal mega damage. The purpose of this is to keep a clear line between which mechanics apply to which kind of combat. A bunch of undead landing on your ship and attacking the crew is a ground scale fight, while battling a massive space kraken or a rogue moon is a mega scale fight.": "当你读完这本补充资料时，你可能已经看到巨型这个词出现了很多次。在《荒野大镖客》中，你可以用地面规模或巨型规模进行战斗。地面比例是你在玩D&D 5e时可能已经熟悉的比例。巨型比例是发生在船舶战斗中的比例。如果本书将某样东西称为巨型，那就意味着该东西只适用于船舶规模的战斗。例如，船只有超大的命中率，也叫船体点数，它们会造成超大的伤害。这样做的目的是为了保持哪种机制适用于哪种战斗之间的清晰界限。一群亡灵降落在你的船上并攻击船员是地面规模的战斗，而与巨大的太空海怪或流氓月球作战则是超大规模的战斗。",
	"As a general rule of thumb, something mega is 100 times what it normally would be. For example, ground scale has a 5-foot by 5-foot grid, while at mega scale, ship combat has a 500-foot by 500-foot grid. If you deal 1 damage to a creature, they lose 1 hit point, but if you deal 1 mega damage to a creature, they lose 100 hit points, which is equivalent to 1 mega hit point.": "作为一般的经验法则，超大型的东西是正常情况下的100倍。例如，地面规模有一个5英尺乘5英尺的格子，而在巨型规模下，船舶战斗有一个500英尺乘500英尺的格子。如果你对一个生物造成1次伤害，他们就会失去1个命中点，但如果你对一个生物造成1次超大型伤害，他们就会失去100个命中点，这相当于1个超大型命中点。",
	"As you might imagine, this means you could easily mop up Tiamat with her ~600 hit points by dealing just 6 mega hit points. For this reason, it is important to understand that this difference of scale is a convention for the division of mechanics, not for translating them between scales. Just as a wizard shouldn't be casting a ground scale fireball at an enemy ship, an enemy ship shouldn't be attacking a ground scale wizard. There are ways for the wizard to cast their spells in a mega scale fight, and if the enemy ship wants to attack the wizard, they can get in close and board the wizard's ship and handle it in ground combat.": "正如你所想象的那样，这意味着你可以通过处理6个巨大的命中率来轻易地拖垮拥有600点命中率的提亚马特。由于这个原因，重要的是要理解这种规模的差异是机械划分的惯例，而不是在规模之间的转换。就像一个巫师不应该向敌舰施放地面规模的火球一样，敌舰也不应该攻击地面规模的巫师。巫师有办法在超大规模的战斗中施展他们的法术，如果敌舰想要攻击巫师，他们可以靠近并登上巫师的飞船，在地面战斗中处理。",
	"One thing that doesn't scale up between these scales is time. A single round of combat is 6 seconds in both. The purpose of this is to make it easier on the DM should player characters be in ground combat while others are on the ship fighting against something else.": "有一件事在这两个尺度之间不存在规模上的差异，那就是时间。一轮战斗的时间在两者中都是6秒。这样做的目的是，如果玩家角色在地面上作战，而其他人在飞船上与其他东西作战时，可以让管理员更轻松。",
	"In a normal D&D 5e game, there are melee and ranged attacks, which can be either weapon or spell attacks. While it may seem intuitive that the cannons on a ship would be dexterity based ranged weapons, this leaves many martial characters at a disadvantage that doesn't feel particularly fun. For this reason, this system has a new kind of attack, a {@i Ship Weapon Attack}.": "在正常的D&D 5e游戏中，有近战和远程攻击，可以是武器或法术攻击。虽然看起来很直观，船上的大炮会是基于灵巧的远程武器，但这让许多武将角色处于劣势，感觉不是特别有趣。出于这个原因，这个系统有一种新的攻击方式，即（%0%）。",
	"When a character makes a ship weapon attack, they roll a d20 and add their proficiency plus either their Strength or Dexterity modifier (their choice) to the attack roll. Based on circumstances, the DM may call for this roll to be made at advantage or disadvantage. If the total of this attack meets or beats the AC of the target, the attack hits. On a hit, the character rolls the damage of the ship weapon, but they do not add their modifier to the damage roll.": "当一个角色进行舰船武器攻击时，他们会掷一个D20，并在攻击卷上加上他们的熟练度和他们的力量或灵巧修饰（他们的选择）。根据情况，DM可以要求在优势或劣势的情况下进行该卷。如果这次攻击的总和达到或超过了目标的AC，则攻击命中。一旦命中，角色就会卷起舰船武器的伤害，但他们不会在伤害卷上加上自己的修正值。",
	"Some classes have features that modify their attacks. Both the Gunner and Fighter Helmsman role have a feature to allow these to work in ship combat subject to DM approval. Using a feature like {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} with a ship weapon is fairly self-explanatory, but a feature like a barbarian's Reckless Attack doesn't translate well to mega scale. It either has no drawback or it has a drawback that hampers the entire group (beyond what it normally would). Luckily, a barbarian could jump into a Spirit Warrior where Reckless Attack makes more sense.": "一些等级有修改其攻击的功能。枪手和战士舵手的角色都有一个特性，允许这些角色在船舶战斗中发挥作用，但需要得到DM的批准。在舰船武器上使用（%0%）这样的特征是不言自明的，但像野蛮人的鲁莽攻击这样的特征并不能很好地转化为巨型规模。它要么没有缺点，要么有一个阻碍整个团体的缺点（超出正常情况下的缺点）。幸运的是，野蛮人可以跳到精神战士中，在那里鲁莽的攻击更有意义。",
	"DMs, remember that players build their characters because they like to use the abilities of the character. Reckless Attack is problematic because the drawback effects the entire party. Something like Divine Smite has no such drawback. I encourage you to be open and adaptable to using class features at mega scale!": "DM们，请记住，玩家建立他们的角色是因为他们喜欢使用角色的能力。鲁莽的攻击是有问题的，因为它的缺点影响到整个团队。像 \"神圣打击 \"这样的东西就没有这样的缺点。我鼓励你以开放和适应的态度来使用超大规模的阶级特征。",
	"As a DM, you may encounter a situation where some player characters are aboard the ship while others are either aboard another ship or on the ground. Since combat is 6 seconds on both scales, you can run both of these side by side if you wish.": "作为DM，你可能会遇到这样的情况：一些玩家角色在船上，而其他玩家角色要么在另一艘船上，要么在地上。由于两个规模的战斗都是6秒，如果你愿意，你可以把这两个规模的战斗并列进行。",
	"On a creature's turn in initiative, they may choose whether to act on ground scale or to act on mega scale. If a character is aboard an enemy ship, they can't be operating one of the party's ship's guns, for example. If they are busy fighting enemies on their ship, they can't focus on ship combat. Use good judgment.": "在一个生物的主动权回合中，他们可以选择是按地面规模行动还是按巨型规模行动。例如，如果一个角色在敌人的船上，他们就不能操作一方的舰炮。如果他们正忙于在船上与敌人作战，他们就不能专注于船上作战。使用良好的判断力。",
	"In most cases, ship combats are fought until one side surrenders or runs away. It is truly rare for them to result in a ship's destruction. Even if the bridge crew want to fight to the death, most crew will mutiny and run up the white flag to take their chances. Better than suffocating in wildspace. Few would want to destroy a ship anyway. Ships are valuable loot.": "在大多数情况下，战舰的战斗一直持续到一方投降或逃跑。导致船只被摧毁的情况确实很罕见。即使舰桥上的船员想要战斗到死，大多数船员也会叛变，举起白旗去碰碰运气。总比在荒野空间里窒息要好。反正很少有人会想摧毁一艘船。船只是有价值的战利品。",
	"A ship's grapple always involves a contested check, but the check is determined by how the grapple was initiated. When a ship is grappled to another, both ships move at half their normal speed, and both move when the other moves. A ship grapple ends when a ship's Captain uses their action to break it and passes the escape DC of the initial grapple. A ship which is at 50% or fewer hull points has disadvantage on grapple checks. A ship at 25% or fewer hull points will usually have a mutiny to force the bridge crew to surrender.": "一艘船的抓取总是涉及到一个有争议的检查，但这个检查是由抓取的开始方式决定的。当一艘船被抓到另一艘船上时，两艘船都以正常速度的一半移动，并且在对方移动时都会移动。当一艘船的船长使用他们的行动来打破它，并且通过了初始抓捕的逃脱DC时，一艘船的抓捕就结束了。一艘船的船体点数为50%或更少时，在抓捕检查中处于不利地位。一艘船在25%或更少的船体点数时，通常会发生兵变，迫使舰桥人员投降。",
	"While in a ship grapple, the crew of either side can board the other if a boarding party is initiated by the Captain. Otherwise fighting commences on the ship.": "在舰艇抓斗中，如果舰长发起登船队，任何一方的船员都可以登上对方。否则，船上的战斗就开始了。",
	"When engaged in a ship fight, it's important for player characters to have a way to contribute to the fight. If the fight feels too much like the ships themselves fighting, like in a classic war game, often players won't feel like they are still playing their character. To help with this, Wildjammer makes use of bridge crew roles. A creature can only occupy a single bridge crew role at a time. Some roles, like the Captain, Helmsman, or Boatswain can have only one occupant, while Gunner and Fighter Helmsman can have as many as the ship has capacity for. A creature can switch between roles as a bonus action on their turn, but if the role they are switching into is occupied, the current occupant must agree to the swap.": "当参与战舰战斗时，玩家角色有办法对战斗做出贡献是很重要的。如果战斗的感觉太像船只本身的战斗，就像在经典的战争游戏中一样，玩家往往不会觉得他们还在扮演自己的角色。为了帮助解决这个问题，《荒野大镖客》使用了舰桥船员的角色。一个生物在同一时间只能占据一个舰桥船员角色。一些角色，如船长、舵手或船夫，只能有一个人，而炮手和战斗机舵手可以有足够多的船的容量。一个生物可以在他们的回合中作为一个额外的行动在不同的角色之间进行转换，但是如果他们要转换的角色被占用了，那么当前的占用者必须同意进行交换。",
	"As a character levels up, they also gain new abilities for their bridge crew roles. Starting at 1* level, a character gains 4 bridge crew proficiencies. They gain 2 more points at levels 5, 9, 13, and 17. Each character starts at rank 0 in each bridge crew role and can spend points to increase their rank, unlocking that rank's feature. You must meet the level requirement to buy a rank and must buy them in order.": "随着角色等级的提高，他们也会获得新的能力，用于他们的舰桥人员角色。从1*级开始，一个角色获得4个舰桥人员的能力。他们在5、9、13和17级时又获得2点。每个角色在每个舰桥人员角色中都从0级开始，可以花费点数来提高他们的等级，解锁该等级的功能。你必须满足等级要求才能购买等级，而且必须按顺序购买。",
	"A character may reallocate their ranks by spending 1 week of downtime per rank changed.": "一个角色可以通过每改变一个等级花费1周的停工时间来重新分配他们的等级。",
	"There are five roles included in this supplement:": "本补编中包括五个角色。",
	"You lead the crew in repairing the wildjammer and working the sails.": "你带领船员们修理野战船和操作船帆。",
	"With a booming voice, the Captain coordinates their crew and bolsters their abilities.": "舰长用洪亮的声音，协调他们的船员，增强他们的能力。",
	"You deploy in a small fighter craft to harass enemy ships and mega creatures.": "你部署在一个小型战斗机上，骚扰敌人的船只和巨型生物。",
	"You command a small team of crew members in operating one of the ship's weapons.": "你指挥一小队船员操作船上的一种武器。",
	"You are the ship, controlling its every movement around a battlefield.": "你就是那艘船，控制它在战场上的每一个动作。",
	"As the Boatswain (also called the 'bosun') your job aboard a wildjammer includes maintaining and managing the wildjammer's hull, masts, sails, and rigging. You are also responsible for leading the crew in operating the sails and repairing the wildjammer.": "作为船夫（也被称为 \"船神\"），你在野船上的工作包括维护和管理野船的船体、桅杆、船帆和索具。你还负责带领船员操作船帆和修理野船。",
	"Your responsibilities include daily inspections of the wildjammer's hull, masts, sails, rigging, and crew. You provide daily reports to the Captain with the results of your inspection and to keep them up to date with ongoing maintenance and service needs of the wildjammer and crew.": "你的职责包括对野船的船体、桅杆、船帆、索具和船员进行日常检查。你每天向船长提供检查结果的报告，并让他们及时了解野船和船员的持续维护和服务需求。",
	"As a captain, you decide what goes on and when. Through your work, you coordinate the different groups aboard the wildjammer into the most efficient path toward victory.": "作为一名船长，你决定什么事情和什么时候进行。通过你的工作，你协调野战船上的不同小组，使其以最有效的方式走向胜利。",
	"Your responsibilities include being bold and decisive when issuing commands. You are responsible for the safety of the wildjammer and its crew, as well as the success of the crew.  Every captain sits with the axe of mutiny over their neck, which means captains tend to be those with the force of personality to keep people unified and understanding.": "你的责任包括在发布命令时要大胆果断。你要对野战船及其船员的安全负责，也要对船员的成功负责。 每个船长的脖子上都坐着叛变的斧头，这意味着船长往往是那些具有人格力量的人，以保持人们的团结和理解。",
	"A Fighter Helmsman acts as a fighter pilot for a pips Using small craft, these fighters launch out of or off of a larger wildjammer with the cargo to hold it. They are able to move quickly and make devastating targeted attacks to disable and weaken enemy wildjammers.": "战斗机舵手作为战斗机飞行员，使用小型飞船，这些战斗机从较大的野战机中发射出来，或者从带有货物的野战机上发射出来。他们能够快速移动，并进行毁灭性的定向攻击，以破坏和削弱敌人的野战机。",
	"Unlike a Helmsman, a Fighter Helmsman doesn't use a Wildjammer Helm, meaning they don't have to be a spellcaster. Instead, their ships make use of alternate forms of propulsion fueled by the aether of wildspace and the phlogiston of the rainbow ocean. While these helms might seem better than a Wildjammer Helm at first glance, they only generate enough power to move the smallest of vessels in space, and never at jamming speeds necessary to cross large distances. As a result, these fighters are best when deployed from a larger ship for combat encounters.": "与舵手不同，战斗机舵手不使用野战舵，这意味着他们不需要是一个施法者。相反，他们的战舰使用由荒野空间的乙醚和彩虹海洋的活塞提供燃料的另一种推进方式。虽然这些头盔乍看之下可能比野蛮人头盔更好，但它们产生的动力只够在太空中移动最小的船只，而且从来没有达到跨越大距离所需的干扰速度。因此，这些战机最好是从较大的飞船上部署，以便进行战斗交锋。",
	"When you take on the role of a Gunner, you are put in command of a small group of crew members operating a ship mounted weapon. These weapons are designed with sufficient firepower to puncture even the greatest of beasts one might find while sailing into the depths of wildspace.": "当你扮演炮手的角色时，你将指挥一小队船员操作船上的武器。这些武器被设计成具有足够的火力，甚至可以刺穿在航行到荒野空间深处时可能发现的最大的野兽。",
	"A ship can have as many Gunners as it has weapons. Any character can be a Gunner, as ship weapons use either your Strength or your Dexterity. If a character is a spellcaster, they can even get the weapon enchanted to use their spellcasting ability modifier.": "一艘船有多少武器，就可以有多少炮手。任何角色都可以成为炮手，因为船上的武器使用你的力量或你的灵巧。如果一个角色是一个施法者，他们甚至可以让武器被施以魔法，以使用他们的施法能力修正值。",
	"As a Gunner, your job is to bring swift death upon anything that dares to threaten your ship.": "作为一名炮手，你的工作是让任何敢于威胁你的飞船的东西迅速死亡。",
	"When you settle down into the helm of a wildjammer, you feel the ship become a natural extension of your body, moving just as if you were walking. This gives you, the Helmsman, the most intimate knowledge of the wildjammer. When it is hurt, you can feel it. When nearly crashing into an asteroid, you feel your own heart beating with adrenaline. The ship isn't just an inanimate tool, the ship is you.": "当你在野战船上掌舵时，你会感觉到船成为你身体的自然延伸，就像你在走路一样移动。这使你，舵手，对野战船有了最深入的了解。当它受到伤害时，你可以感觉到它。当差点撞上一颗小行星时，你能感觉到自己的心脏因肾上腺素而跳动。这艘船不仅仅是一个无生命的工具，这艘船就是你。",
	"As the Helmsman, you control how the ship moves around the battlefield. You are the one who powers it and moves it. While the Boatswain and the crew work to manage the sails that enable your full movement, it is ultimately you who controls how the ship moves.": "作为舵手，你控制飞船如何在战场上移动。你是为它提供动力和移动它的人。虽然舵手和船员们努力管理使你能够充分移动的风帆，但最终是你控制着船的移动。",
	"Spelljammer was initially thought of as being AD&D in space (Sorry - Innnnn Sppaaaaace!), but soon became obvious as a way to tie the existing campaigns together. One of the challenges of all the campaigns existing in the same reality, was that there are small differences like gods, for example, some of which overflow into other campaigns and others which do not. And things like the constellations of Krynn moving around. Crystal spheres, enclosing each solar system in its own container, were the answer to that.": "Spelljammer最初被认为是太空中的AD&D（对不起--Innnn Sppaaaaace！），但很快就成为将现有战役联系在一起的明显方式。所有的活动都存在于同一个现实中，其中一个挑战是存在一些小的差异，比如说神明，其中一些溢出到其他活动中，另一些则没有。还有像Krynn的星座到处移动的事情。水晶球，把每个太阳系围在它自己的容器里，是解决这个问题的办法。",
	"Those who have tried to merge the settings together have often run into little hiccups. Often, these hiccups are easy enough for a DM to handle by just ruling things at their table. Want to stick to the Forgotten Realms pantheon? The DM says it and it is so. When creating a rule set like Wildjammer, we don't have that same luxury. The rules need to account for whatever.": "那些试图将这些设定合并在一起的人经常会遇到一些小麻烦。通常情况下，这些小插曲对管理员来说很容易处理，只需在他们的桌子上规定一下就可以了。想坚持使用《被遗忘的领域》中的万神殿？DM说了，就是这样。当创建像《荒野大镖客》这样的规则集时，我们就没有这样的奢侈。规则需要考虑任何因素。",
	"I concluded the last section talking about how to interpret the planes across settings. In this section, I'll be talking about faiths that exist in wildspace across the various spheres. These gods may be represented in a setting or not, but they can usually be found somewhere in wildspace!": "我在上一节结束时谈到了如何在不同的环境中解释平面。在这一节中，我将讨论存在于荒野空间中的、跨越不同界线的信仰。这些神灵可能在设定中有所体现，也可能没有，但他们通常可以在荒野空间的某个地方找到！\"。",
	"How is it that one god has so much power in one setting but not in another? In Wildjammer, the answer is rather simple: No matter how strong a god is in one sphere, that power doesn't translate to another sphere. No matter how hegemonic their power may be in their sphere, the sphere itself is a hard limit. Ifa god wishes to have power in another sphere, they need expand their religion and get followers in that sphere.": "为什么一个神在一个环境中拥有如此大的权力，而在另一个环境中却没有呢？在《荒野猎人》中，答案相当简单。无论一个神在一个领域有多强大，这种力量都不会转化到另一个领域。无论他们的力量在他们的领域中多么霸道，领域本身就是一个硬限制。神希望在另一个领域拥有权力，他们需要扩大他们的宗教并在该领域获得追随者。",
	"A consequence of this is that classes like cleric or paladin that derive divine power from a deity end up beyond the reach of their god.": "这样做的一个后果是，像牧师或圣骑士这样从神灵那里获得神力的类别最终会超出他们的神的范围。",
	"Luckily, there are two divine spells included in this supplement that help account for this: {@spell Contact Home Power|wjmais} and {@spell Detect Powers|wjmais}. These spells allow the cleric or paladin to once again regain spell slots while they are away from home. Paladins that worship an ideal rather than a specific god will still want to use {@spell Detect Powers|wjmais}, as it links them up to the power of that ideal in the new crystal sphere.": "幸运的是，本补充文件中有两个神圣的法术可以帮助说明这一点：（%0%）和（%1%）。这些法术使牧师或圣骑士在离家时能再次恢复法术槽。崇拜理想而非特定神灵的圣骑士仍然希望使用{@spell Detect Powers|wjmais}，因为它将他们与新水晶球中的理想力量联系起来。",
	"Warlocks are able to bypass this limitation because their patrons are generally lesser planar beings that don't have the same power as a god. Gods tend to only get concerned about the intervention of other gods.": "术士能够绕过这个限制，因为他们的赞助人一般都是较小的星球生物，没有和神一样的力量。神灵往往只关注其他神灵的干预。",
	"If a cleric or paladin were to spend the time to spread the faith of their god in another sphere, they would start regaining spell slots as normal. Though be warned, the gods of that sphere may take issue with a cleric or paladin coming along to proselytize the faith of an interloping deity.": "如果一个牧师或圣骑士花时间在另一个领域传播他们的神的信仰，他们将开始恢复正常的法术槽。但请注意，该领域的神灵可能会对牧师或圣骑士来劝说一个跨领域的神灵的信仰有意见。",
	"Some gods already occupy multiple spheres, giving their clerics and paladins more freedom. Think of how many different settings use Correlon and Lolth. Worship of these gods can be found in multiple settings, and so the clerics and paladins of those faiths have power in those settings. There are also a handful of popular faiths in Wildjammer that are present almost everywhere. These faiths are the Temple of Ptah, the Path and the Way, and the Celestians.": "一些神灵已经占据了多个领域，给他们的牧师和圣骑士更多的自由。想想看，有多少不同的设定使用科瑞隆和洛尔思。对这些神的崇拜可以在多个环境中找到，因此这些信仰的神职人员和圣骑士在这些环境中拥有权力。在《荒野猎人》中也有少数流行的信仰，几乎到处都有。这些信仰是普塔神庙、路径和道路，以及天神。",
	"Ptah is among the oldest of the known gods to exist. While groundling civilizations based off of Egyptian mythology see Ptah as a god of artisans and designers, the spacefaring Temple of Ptah grant Ptah far greater prestige than such a minor title. The Temple of Ptah believe that Ptah is the creator god of the spheres, the one that first found a way to separate wildspace from the phlogiston.": "普塔是已知存在的最古老的神之一。虽然基于埃及神话的地面文明将普塔视为工匠和设计师之神，但航天的普塔神庙给予普塔的威望远远超过这样一个小称号。普塔神庙相信，普塔是球体的创造者，是第一个找到将荒野空间与phlogiston分离的方法的人。",
	"Priests of Ptah are fanatics about converting people to their faith. They argue that since they don't need rituals to contact their god in other spheres, it shows that they have found the originator god from which all the spheres were forged Opponents rightly point out that the Temple of Ptah is old enough and has such wide reach that they have worship in most spheres. Their access to magic comes from them being widespread, not because Ptah has some special status.": "普塔的祭司们狂热地想让人们皈依他们的信仰。他们认为，既然他们不需要仪式就能在其他领域接触到他们的神，这表明他们已经找到了所有领域都是由它铸造出来的始祖神。 反对者正确地指出，普塔神庙已经足够古老，并且有如此广泛的影响力，他们在大多数领域都有崇拜者。他们获得魔法的机会来自于他们的广泛性，而不是因为普塔具有某种特殊地位。",
	"In their zealotry, the priests of Ptah will often conflate Ptah with whatever god is at the top of a pantheon they run into to try to show that Ptah is the supreme ruler of all pantheons.  This has gone so as far as to have the Priests of Ptah saying that Ao the Overgod of Realmspace is an aspect of Ptah. This stance often leads to others being hostile to them.": "在他们的狂热中，普塔的祭司们经常会把普塔和他们遇到的万神殿中处于顶端的任何神灵混为一谈，试图表明普塔是所有万神殿的最高统治者。 这甚至包括普塔的祭司们说，境界空间的超神奥是普塔的一个方面。这种立场常常导致其他人对他们产生敌意。",
	"{@b Suggested Domains:} Forge, Knowledge": "{@b Suggested Domains:} 锻造，知识",
	"Originating from the continent Kara'tur of Toril (the Forgotten Realms campaign setting), the Path and the Way is a general name that refers to the countless variations of belief in the celestial bureaucracy. This belief holds that the entirety of the universe and the planes is all a well managed and organized bureaucracy with specific powers taking on unique roles within that bureaucracy.": "起源于托里尔的卡拉图尔大陆（《被遗忘的领域》战役设定），\"路径和道路 \"是一个总称，指的是天体官僚机构中无数的信仰变化。这种信仰认为，整个宇宙和星球都是一个管理有序的官僚机构，特定的力量在这个官僚机构中承担着独特的角色。",
	"Funny enough, there is great disagreement over which gods fill which roles at which time, resulting in this faith splintering into countless factions with their own interpretation. It doesn't appear to matter much, however. Paladins and clerics of the Path and the Way from one sphere are just as at home in another sphere, suggesting that they are all correct and connected in some divine way. As such, a cleric from Kara'tur in Realmspace that sees the Overgod Ao as the head of the celestial bureaucracy is still in good standing with the Path and the Way of Greyspace, where they believe that Boccob resides at the top of the celestial bureaucracy instead of Ao.": "有趣的是，对于哪些神在什么时候担任什么角色存在很大的分歧，导致这种信仰分裂成无数派别，有各自的解释。不过，这似乎并不重要。来自一个领域的圣骑士和道路牧师在另一个领域也一样自如，这表明他们都是正确的，并以某种神圣的方式联系在一起。因此，一个来自境界空间的卡拉图尔的教士，如果将超神敖视为天体官僚机构的首领，那么他仍然与灰色空间的路径和道路保持着良好的关系，在那里他们相信博卡布居住在天体官僚机构的顶端而不是敖。",
	"Although this faith is split into many factions, the factions rarely war with one another in a violent fashion. They work with one another readily enough, even if they have different interpretations. This has allowed the Path and the Way to be a considerable power in the spheres. On top of that, they have no overt enemies. Since the followers of the Path and the Way believe that everything has its place in the celestial bureaucracy, they don't make enemies easily. Only those who subvert their faith or attack their people are enemies.": "虽然这种信仰分为许多派别，但各派别之间很少以暴力的方式进行战争。他们很乐意彼此合作，即使他们有不同的解释。这使得 \"路 \"和 \"道 \"在各领域都有相当大的影响力。除此之外，他们没有公开的敌人。由于 \"道路与方法 \"的追随者相信在天体的官僚机构中一切都有它的位置，他们不容易树敌。只有那些颠覆他们信仰或攻击他们的人是敌人。",
	"As you can probably guess, the only people they have issue with are the followers of Ptah who claim it is Ptah at the head of the celestial bureaucracy. This dislike hasn't turned into bloodshed, but tensions do grow with time.": "你可能能猜到，他们唯一有意见的是普塔的追随者，他们声称是普塔在领导天体官僚机构。这种不喜欢还没有变成流血事件，但紧张关系确实随着时间的推移而增长。",

	"The Celestians are a loosely knit group of religious people that follow the god Celestian from Greyspace. They build their temples exclusively in space, out of the influence of planets. They believe firmly in being a traveler, not settling down into one place or another. It is their belief that a good life is one spent traveling across as many spheres as they can and seeing as much of this world as possible. Some say that Celestian ranks his followers in the afterlife based on how many places they have visited.": "天体人是一个松散的宗教团体，追随来自灰色空间的天体神。他们专门在太空中建造寺庙，不受行星的影响。他们坚信要做一个旅行者，而不是在一个地方定居下来。他们相信，美好的生活是在尽可能多的球体中旅行，尽可能多地看到这个世界。有人说，塞莱斯蒂安根据其追随者去过的地方的多少，在来世给他们排名。",
	"Celestians are always in touch with their god while they are in wildspace, even if the faith of Celestian has no influence in the sphere. That said, if they were to land on a planet, they would then be out of contact with their god, as they are now on the planet rather than in wildspace.": "天体人在荒野空间时总是与他们的神保持联系，即使天体人的信仰在这个领域没有影响。也就是说，如果他们降落在一个星球上，他们就会与他们的神失去联系，因为他们现在是在这个星球上，而不是在野外空间。",
	"Celestians have allies of convenience. Since they rarely get involved in war or conflict, Celestians are only really valued for their wanderlust. Worshipers of Celestian will often take long voyages that other Helmsman would reject. Many trading companies deal with the Celestians for this reason.  Their alliances have limits though. Celestians will not fly warships or any ships that carry slaves. They don't seek war or conquest, and they won't aid others in doing so. They are allowed to aid mercenaries, but only when the mercenary work is defensive in nature.": "天体人有方便的盟友。由于他们很少卷入战争或冲突，天人族真正被重视的只是他们的漫游癖。天神的崇拜者经常会进行其他舵手会拒绝的长途旅行。许多贸易公司因为这个原因与天体人打交道。 不过他们的联盟是有限制的。天体人不会驾驶战舰或任何载有奴隶的船只。他们不寻求战争或征服，也不会协助他人这样做。他们被允许帮助雇佣兵，但只有当雇佣兵的工作是防御性的。",
	"The Seekers find themselves working with the Celestians the most. This has resulted in a substantial amount of overlap between Celestian worshipers and membership in the Seekers.": "探索者发现自己与天体人的合作最多。这导致了天体崇拜者和探索者组织成员之间有大量的重叠。",
	"The Temple of Ptah has a deep and long held hatred for the Celestians. This is firmly rooted in the fact that Celestians, much like followers of the Path and the Way, are widespread enough to be a threat to what they claim to be Ptah's unique status.": "普塔神庙对天体人有着深刻而长久的仇恨。这牢牢地扎根于这样一个事实：天人，就像路径和道路的追随者一样，广泛存在，足以对他们所声称的普塔的独特地位构成威胁。",

	"Ever since the elves first began to plan their departure from the Feywild and going to the material plane, a small contingent of elves were fearful of what this could mean for their species. Separated across various worlds, their species could become more fractured than ever, and as a result, become more vulnerable to their enemies. Rather than join the others on the various worlds, these elves decided to migrate to space to act as a cohesive force for elf-kind. These elves formed the Elven Imperial Navy.": "自从精灵们第一次开始计划离开精灵世界，前往物质世界，一小部分精灵就对这对他们的物种意味着什么感到恐惧。分离在不同的世界中，他们的物种可能会变得比以往更加支离破碎，因此，变得更容易受到敌人的攻击。这些精灵没有加入各个世界的其他人，而是决定迁徙到太空，作为精灵族的凝聚力。这些精灵组成了精灵帝国海军。",
	"Through careful cultivation of the starfly plant, a plant native to wildspace, the original members of the Elven Imperial Navy managed to grow the first of the Armadas.  These massive butterfly shaped wildjammers could host hundreds of elves and carry them through space for an extended period of time. This is achieved through carefully cultivated gardens that regularly replenish the air envelope.": "通过对原产于荒野空间的植物--星萤植物的精心培育，精灵帝国海军的最初成员成功地培育出了第一艘军舰。 这些巨大的蝴蝶形状的野战船可以容纳数百名精灵，并带着他们在太空中航行一段很长的时间。这是通过精心培育的花园实现的，这些花园定期补充空气包络。",
	"Before long, the Elven Imperial Navy began to growa smaller form of the Armada called the Man-o-War. Then they grew the Cutter and finally the Flitter. Each of these is a smaller version of the previous, and all together they make up the backbone of the Elven Imperial Navy.": "不久之后，精灵帝国海军就开始了名为 \"战神 \"的小型舰队的建设。然后，他们发展了 \"切割者\"，最后发展了 \"飞鸟\"。每一种都是前一种的缩小版，它们共同构成了精灵帝国海军的骨干力量。",
	"Their primary mission is two-fold: First, they battle the enemies of elf-kind across the many spheres and do so in support of groundling elven civilization. Second, they coordinate between elf-kind by performing an annual check up, dispatching a ship to check in on every major known settlement.": "他们的主要任务有两个方面。首先，他们在许多领域与精灵族的敌人作战，并支持地面的精灵文明。其次，他们通过执行年度检查来协调精灵族之间的关系，派遣一艘船去检查每个主要的已知定居点。",
	"Both of these missions are coordinated through their base of operations, {@i Lionheart}. Lionheart is the name of a collection of Armadas that have been joined together into a base. This base has been blessed directly by the Seldarine to make it into a mythal, one capable of transporting the entire base from one sphere to another. This mobility has helped assure that no matter how deadly a threat the elves face, they will never have their main base of operations cornered.": "这两个任务都是通过他们的行动基地来协调的，{@i Lionheart}。狮心 \"是一个集合了多个军团的基地的名字，这些军团被联合起来成为一个基地。这个基地得到了塞尔达林的直接祝福，使其成为一个神话般的存在，能够将整个基地从一个球体运送到另一个球体。这种流动性有助于确保无论精灵们面临多么致命的威胁，他们都不会把他们的主要行动基地逼到绝境。",

Although their arrogance is obvious to anyone who meets them, they are generally through of as a force of stability, which in turn drives trade.": "作为所有这些的结果，精灵帝国海军已经成为球体中发现的最大的军事力量之一。虽然他们的傲慢对任何遇到他们的人来说都是显而易见的，但他们通常被认为是一种稳定的力量，这反过来又推动了贸易。",

It is the purview of this Knight Commander to choose how justice is to be enacted within the sphere and which evils should be hunted down. While enemies like the neogi make for easily agreed upon enemies, sometimes different Knight Commanders will disagree.

	"The Pragmatic Order of Thought, often referred to just as \"Pots\" is an organization devoted to undermining slavery and assuring the promises of freedom and liberty among the various species of wildspace. From the point of view of the Pots, not enough is being done to counteract slavery in wildspace. Both the neogi and illithids are well known for taking humanoids as slaves, and while it is true that slave trading is illegal with both the Elven Imperial Navy and the Company of the Chalice, more needs to be done and it needs to be done now.": "实用主义思想组织，通常被称为 \"壶\"，是一个致力于破坏奴隶制的组织，并确保在荒野空间的各种物种中实现自由的承诺。从 \"壶 \"的角度来看，在反对荒野空间的奴隶制方面做得还不够。尼奥吉人和伊利希德人都以把人类当作奴隶而闻名，虽然在精灵帝国海军和圣杯公司看来，奴隶贸易确实是非法的，但需要做更多的工作，而且现在就需要做。",
	"This organization is highly decentralized, with various splinter cells each focused on a different task without much coordination between cells. In places where slavery is illegal through another powerful faction, the Pots work as spies to root out underground slave rings and bring them to justice. In spheres where slavery isn't illegal, whether it be due to anarchy or despotism, Pots run safety shelters and help smuggle slaves out of these spheres and work to undermine slavery operations at every turn.": "这个组织是高度分散的，各种分裂的细胞各自专注于不同的任务，细胞之间没有太多的协调。在那些通过另一个强大的派别将奴隶制定为非法的地方，锅子们作为间谍工作，铲除地下奴隶团伙并将其绳之以法。在奴隶制不违法的地方，不管是由于无政府主义还是专制主义，锅子们经营着安全庇护所，帮助把奴隶偷运出这些地方，并致力于破坏奴隶制运作的每一步。",
	"Some organizations that agree with the anti-slavery focus of the Pots feel that the Pots are losing focus on the big picture and there is a way to effect greater change at a higher level Pots disagree with this reasoning.

That said, if both are possible, they'll definitely do both!": "一些同意壶友会反奴隶制重点的组织认为，壶友会失去了对大局的关注，有办法在更高的层次上实现更大的变化，壶友会不同意这种推理。如果有机会现在拯救10个奴隶，或者让他们以后拯救1万个奴隶，壶友们一般会选择现在拯救10个奴隶。也就是说，如果两者都有可能，他们肯定会同时进行",
	"Freedom is secondary to security and peace. This is the central tenet held by The Tenth Pit, a small but highly organized group that present themselves as a force for stability, but ultimately seek to serve their own self-interest through control. To those of The Tenth Pit, there is nothing wrong with being a tyrant, a despot, a cruel monarch, just so long as that restrains lawlessness and brings stability to the lives of those in wildspace.

	"Mercantile organizations are exactly what you expect: They are groups devoted to making profit by trading goods between spheres or planets.

	"As the situation became more hostile, an elven admiral named Sindiath offered an alternative. He would retire from the Elven Imperial Navy and take a handful of the ships that were policing these lines. These ships would be rebranded as a private mercantile organization called The Sindiath Line.  The Elven Imperial Navy would still control this group behind the scenes, but to the people of the spheres, it would appear as an independent trade and transportation organization.  Should any of their ships ever find a threat to elf-kind, they would immediately report it back to the Elven Imperial Navy.": "随着局势变得更加险恶，一位名叫辛迪亚斯的精灵上将提出了一个替代方案。他将从精灵帝国海军中退役，并带走少数几艘在这些航线上巡逻的船只。这些船将被重新命名为一个名为 \"辛迪亚斯航线 \"的私人商业组织。 精灵帝国海军仍将在幕后控制这个组织，但对于球体的人们来说，它将作为一个独立的贸易和运输组织出现。 如果他们的任何船只发现了对精灵族的威胁，他们会立即向精灵帝国海军报告。",

	"The Chainmen is a human operated slavery organization that actively seeks to acquire slaves and sell them to whoever is looking to buy. As a result, The Chainmen are hated and feared by most decent folks in the spheres, but regrettably they can be found in many port cities.": "链子人是一个由人类经营的奴隶制组织，他们积极寻求获得奴隶，并将他们卖给任何想买的人。因此，链子人被球体中大多数正直的人所憎恨和惧怕，但遗憾的是，他们在许多港口城市都能找到。",
	"As a mercantile organization, The Chainmen avoids getting involved in taking slaves from other wildspace civilizations. Though they are known to swoop down and abduct groundling humanoids into slavery, when it comes to wildspace, they work through other means. They will often set up contracts with governments to get rid of unwanted prisoners in their dungeons. Another common practice is for The Chainmen to offer bounties on criminals against the local government, usually at a higher price than the local government would pay. Unfortunately for many, The Chainmen rarely concern themselves with making sure a bounty is legitimate, resulting in many being put in chains on the claim that they're a criminal.": "作为一个商业组织，链子人避免卷入从其他荒野空间文明中获取奴隶。虽然他们也知道会俯冲下来绑架地面人类作为奴隶，但当涉及到荒野空间时，他们会通过其他方式来工作。他们经常与政府签订合同，以摆脱他们地牢中不受欢迎的囚犯。另一个常见的做法是，链子人提供对当地政府的罪犯的赏金，通常比当地政府支付的价格要高。对许多人来说，不幸的是，链子人很少关注确保赏金是合法的，导致许多人因声称自己是罪犯而被戴上镣铐。",
	"There are a few other factions found in wildspace, but they don't fit as either military or mercantile.": "在荒野空间还有一些其他派别，但他们不适合作为军事或商业派别。",
	"This organization has a singular focus on learning more about space and the big questions that are still unanswered.  For a long while now, academics have noted that the edge of a crystal sphere is always twice the distance from the primary system body as the farthest out planet. Every sphere seems to follow this pattern. Why were they created this way?  And by whom? Is there some greater purpose behind this oddity? These are the types of questions The Seekers like to investigate when traveling through the spheres. The only people they make their enemies are those that spread lies.": "这个组织有一个独特的重点，那就是学习更多关于空间和仍然没有答案的大问题。 很久以来，学者们已经注意到，一个水晶球的边缘与主系统体的距离总是最远的星球的两倍。每个球体似乎都遵循这个模式。为什么它们会被创造成这样？ 又是由谁创造的？这种奇怪的现象背后有什么更大的目的吗？这些都是探索者们在穿越球体时喜欢调查的问题类型。他们唯一的敌人是那些传播谎言的人。",
	"The Xenos are a group of human supremacists with a deep hatred for non-human life. They actively seek to destroy or subjugate any non-human species found around the spheres.  In the point of view of the Xenos, the elves didn't just start leaving Faerun for Evermeet, they were fleeing the Time of Troubles which they started. The elves could have wiped out the orcs once and for all at the end of the Unhuman Wars, but they didn't because they wanted to keep the orcs around to use against groundling humans and maintain their position of superiority. Both of these claims are {@b false}, but the Xenos spread these kind of lies to bolster support for their cause.  This has made them an enemy of the Seekers.": "Xenos是一群人类至上主义者，对非人类生命有着深深的仇恨。他们积极寻求摧毁或征服球体周围发现的任何非人类物种。 在Xenos的观点中，精灵们不仅仅是开始离开Faerun前往Evermeet，他们是在逃离由他们引发的动乱时期。精灵们本可以在非人类战争结束时彻底消灭兽人，但他们没有这样做，因为他们想把兽人留在身边，用来对付地面上的人类，保持他们的优势地位。这两种说法都是{@b false}，但异族人散布这类谎言以加强对他们事业的支持。 这使他们成为探索者的敌人。",
	"This group is a coalition of various spellcasters found across the spheres who come together to share knowledge of magic between one another. They have a strong interest in maintaining stability and order around them so that way they can focus on their spellcraft. This has made the Shapers an ally of anyone that promises to leave them alone to their Art while keeping the distractions to a minimum.": "这个团体是一个由各个领域的施法者组成的联盟，他们聚集在一起，相互之间分享魔法知识。他们对维持周围的稳定和秩序有着强烈的兴趣，这样他们就可以专注于他们的法术。这使得塑造者们成为了任何承诺让他们独自从事艺术的人的盟友，同时将分心的程度降到最低。",
	"If someone is ever looking for some sort of rare magic from some specialized school of magic, the Shapers will generally know someone who can help.": "如果有人想从某个专门的魔法学校寻找某种罕见的魔法，塑造者们一般都会知道谁能帮忙。",
	"In this section, I'll be going over a few major points of interest established in the Wildjammer lore. This includes the solar system of Forgotten Realms (Realmspace), Greyhawk (Greyspace), Dragonlance (Krynnspace), and more. Finally, I'll talk about the Rock of Bral, an asteroid city that can snap into any sphere to start a game!": "在这一节中，我将介绍在《荒野大镖客》传说中确立的几个主要兴趣点。这包括被遗忘的领域（Realmspace）、灰鹰（Greyhawk）、龙之谷（Krynnspace）等太阳系。最后，我将谈一谈布拉尔之石，一个可以扣入任何球体开始游戏的小行星城市!",

	"In Wildjammer, celestial bodies come in many shapes and sizes. Remember that these celestial bodies didn't form through natural processes, but through construction by gods and beings of substantial power.": "在Wildjammer，天体有许多形状和大小。请记住，这些天体并不是通过自然过程形成的，而是通过神和具有实质性力量的生命的建造。",
	"In the following sections, you'll see me refer planets as.  earth body or air body, etc. This is a categorization system used in Wildjammer to define what kind of celestial body it is. There are five types: earth, air, water, fire, and life. The type is determined by the composition of the celestial body from surface to core. For example, earth is an earth body planet because it is primarily earth from surface to core. A water planet would be water from surface to core, and a living planet would be plant life from surface to core.": "在下面的章节中，你会看到我把行星称为：地球体或空气体，等等。这是Wildjammer中使用的一个分类系统，用来定义它是哪种天体。有五种类型：土，空气，水，火，和生命。类型是由天体从表面到核心的组成决定的。例如，地球是一个土体行星，因为它从表面到核心主要是土。一个水行星从表面到核心是水，一个生命行星从表面到核心是植物生命。",
	"As home to the {@i Forgotten Realms} campaign setting, as well as {@i Oriental Adventures} and {@i Al-Qadim}, Realmspace is a particularly lively and active sphere. The gods of Realmspace tend to be more interested in their own politics than messing with spacefarers and the groundlings are more or less unobtrusive. This has resulted in Realmspace being a popular spot for traders, adventurers, and mercenaries.": "作为{@i Forgotten Realms}战役背景的所在地，以及{@i Oriental Adventures}和{@i Al-Qadim}，王国空间是一个特别活泼和活跃的领域。境界空间的诸神往往对他们自己的政治更感兴趣，而不是与太空人打交道，而地面人或多或少都是不引人注意的。这导致境界空间成为商人、冒险家和雇佣兵的热门地点。",
	"The solar system of Realmspace is heliocentric and has eight planets. There are also a handful of other smaller celestial bodies to check out, but I won't go into those in this supplement. For more details, look up {@link SJR2 Realmspace (1991)|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17259/SJR2-Realmspace-2e} originally published by TSR, Inc.": "境界空间的太阳系是日心的，有八颗行星。还有一些其他较小的天体可供查看，但我不会在本补编中介绍这些天体。欲了解更多详情，请查阅（%0%）最初由TSR公司出版。",
	"Realmspace has a large, fiery yellow colored sun. The sun hosts portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire which keep it lit up in flame and is home to fiery creatures.": "境界空间有一个巨大的、火黄色的太阳。太阳上有通往火元素界的门户，使它在火焰中闪闪发光，是火热生物的家园。",
	"Anadia is the closest planet to the Sun in Realmspace. The vast majority of the planet is covered in umber hulks, with the exception of the two poles. The two poles have a more reasonable climate, resulting in lush and fertile earth. The north pole is ruled over by feudal halflings beneath an emperor. The halflings here keep non-halflings in reservations or in guarded slums, claiming it is for their own protection from clever halflings. The south pole lacks a hierarchical structure, with halflings split into various family factions and clans, only trusting those they already know.": "阿纳迪亚是境界空间中离太阳最近的行星。除了两极之外，这个星球的绝大部分都被乌黑的大树所覆盖。两极的气候比较合理，形成了茂盛而肥沃的土地。北极由一个皇帝手下的封建半身人统治着。这里的半身人把非半身人关在保留区或有警卫的贫民窟里，声称这是为了保护他们自己不受聪明的半身人的伤害。南极缺乏等级结构，半身人被分成各种家庭派别和宗族，只信任他们已经认识的人。",
	"The next planet from the sun is Coliar, a gas giant made up of breatheable air with large chunks of earth making up islands that float around rapidly within. There are three dominant lifeforms in this cluster: lizardfolk, aaracokra, and dragons}. While the lizardfolk and aaracokra are in constant war with one another, the dragons play both sides off of one another, and neither side is willing to pick a fight with them. Aaracokra love to fly the winds of Coliar while lizardfolk value how close it is to the sun, believing that being close to the sun makes their eggs hatch stronger offspring. All three deal with wildjammer society.": "从太阳出发的下一个行星是科里亚尔，这是一个由可呼吸的空气组成的气态巨行星，大块的地球组成了岛屿，在里面快速漂浮。在这个星团中，有三种主要的生命体：蜥蜴人、Aaracokra和龙}。蜥蜴人和Aaracokra之间的战争不断，而龙则把双方都玩弄于股掌之间，任何一方都不愿意与他们挑起争端。Aaracokra喜欢在Coliar的风中飞行，而蜥蜴人则看重它离太阳有多近，认为离太阳近会让他们的蛋孵化出更强壮的后代。这三种人都与野人社会打交道。",
	"The third planet from the sun is Toril, the one you are likely most familiar with. The continent of Faerun is the main setting for {@i Forgotten Realms}, while the eastern continent Kara'tur is the setting of {@i Oriental Adventures}. South of both of these is Zak'hara, where the {@i Al-Qadim} setting takes place.  Most civilizations in Faerun and Zak'hara are not aware of wildjammer society and not many seem interested in introducing them to it. Toril is best known in the stars as the home for one of the main branches of the Elven Imperial Navy in Evermeet, as well as for the nations of Shou Lung and Wa in Kara'tur. The Path and the Way has spread far from Shou Lung through voyages of their Treasure Fleet of Dragonships, plus the people of Wa are known throughout the spheres as the creators of the legendary Tsunami wildjammers, considered by many to be among the greatest ships designed yet.": "从太阳算起的第三颗行星是托里尔，是你可能最熟悉的那颗。Faerun大陆是{@i Forgotten Realms}的主要背景，而东部的Kara'tur大陆是{@i Oriental Adventures}的背景。这两个大陆的南部是Zak'hara，那里是{@i Al-Qadim}的背景。 Faerun和Zak'hara的大多数文明都不知道野蛮人社会，似乎也没有多少人有兴趣向他们介绍这个社会。托里尔在星际中最出名的是Evermeet的精灵帝国海军的主要分支之一，以及Kara'tur的Shou Lung和Wa国家的所在地。通过他们的龙船宝藏舰队的航行，\"道路 \"和 \"道路 \"已经从寿隆远远地传播开来，另外，佤族人因创造了传奇的 \"海啸 \"野战船而闻名于世，许多人认为这是迄今为止设计的最伟大的船只之一。",
	"Toril has a moon named Selune which is the home to an unknown race of pale humanoids. Most wildjammer civilization lives in the Tears of Selune, an asteroid field which follows Selune.": "托里尔有一颗名为Selune的卫星，是一个未知的苍白人种的家园。大多数野蛮人文明居住在塞卢娜之泪，这是一个跟随塞卢娜的小行星区域。",
	"Our next planet is Karpri. It is a water planet, meaning that the entire globe is water, from the surface all the way to the core. The poles of the planet have thick ice caps with arctic native creatures. Around the equator is a dense thicket of seaweed and underwater plant life. Between the equator and the ice caps is an area of smooth sailing. There are no islands on Karpri and civilization is entirely underwater. A wildjammer that can land on land could attempt to land on the ice caps, though that is risky at best. There are also some massive branches that grow out of the thicket that can also be landed on, but travelers are warned not to as the thicket is the most dangerous place on the planet.": "我们的下一个星球是卡普瑞。它是一个水行星，意味着整个地球都是水，从表面一直到核心。这个星球的两极有厚厚的冰盖，有北极的本土生物。赤道周围是密密麻麻的海藻和水下植物。在赤道和冰盖之间是一个平稳的航行区域。卡普里岛没有岛屿，文明完全在水下。一个能在陆地上登陆的野人可以尝试在冰盖上登陆，尽管这充其量是有风险的。还有一些从灌木丛中长出来的巨大树枝也可以登陆，但旅行者被警告不要这样做，因为灌木丛是地球上最危险的地方。",
	"Our next planet, Chandos, is also a water world. Unlike Karpri though, this planet has a staggering number of islands. Imagine a water balloon filled with ball bearings and water. That's what Chandos is like. Islands stack upon one another to form something like a surface, but it is constantly in flux around the currents of the planet. Most lifeforms that live on the surface of Chandos live nomadic lives as storms are constantly shifting the position of islands and potentially even destroying them. Any traveler descending into Chandos is advised to bring light, as the large amount of islands above cause the waters within to become quite dark and murky.": "我们的下一个星球，Chandos，也是一个水世界。但与卡普里不同的是，这个星球有数量惊人的岛屿。想象一下，一个装满滚珠轴承和水的水球。这就是Chandos的情况。岛屿相互堆叠，形成类似于表面的东西，但它不断地围绕着这个星球的洋流而变化。生活在钱多斯表面的大多数生命体都过着游牧的生活，因为风暴不断地改变着岛屿的位置，甚至有可能摧毁它们。任何下到钱多多的旅行者都被建议带着光，因为上面大量的岛屿导致里面的水变得相当黑暗和浑浊。",
	"If you ask me, there is no better place to put anglerfish monstrosities in a D&D game than on Chandos.": "如果你问我，在D&D游戏中，没有比钱多多更好的地方可以把鮟鱇鱼的怪兽放在一起。",
	"Do not go to Glyth. These words cannot be emphasized more clearly to any traveler around the spheres. Glyth is a perfect microcosm of what to expect of a universe conquered by mind flayers. Beneath the surface of Glyth reside countless colonies of mind flayers that live in war with one another. In their minds, anyone that lands upon the surface is fair game to enslave, as Glyth is their sovereign property.": "不要去找Glyth。这些话对任何在球体周围的旅行者来说都是再清楚不过的了。格利斯是一个完美的缩影，说明了一个被噬心者征服的宇宙会有什么后果。在Glyth的地表下，居住着无数的心灵传播者的殖民地，他们彼此之间生活在战争之中。在他们看来，任何降落在地表的人都是可以奴役的，因为Glyth是他们的主权财产。",
	"When mind flayers need to deal with one another or with the outside world, they meet on Haven, the moon of Glyth.  This acts as a neutral ground for all of the mind flayers of Glyth and a relatively safe space for travelers.": "当心灵传播者需要彼此打交道或与外部世界打交道时，他们会在Glyth的月亮Haven会面。 这里是所有Glyth的心灵传播者的中立地，也是旅行者的一个相对安全的空间。",
	"Our next planet is Garden. Garden is a large collection of asteroids floating within the same air envelope. A plant connects each of these islands together like a world tree.  Many of the asteroids in Garden have towns and villages that make for a resupply point for travelers through Realmspace.  That said, given the dense number of islands and places to hide, pirates love to prowl around here.": "我们的下一个星球是花园。花园是一个大的小行星集合体，漂浮在同一个空气包络内。一棵植物将这些岛屿连接在一起，就像一棵世界树。 花园中的许多小行星都有城镇和村庄，成为穿越境界空间的旅行者的补给点。 也就是说，鉴于岛屿和藏身之处的密集程度，海盗们喜欢在这里游荡。",
	"Our last planet, H'Catha, is unlike all of the others so far in that it isn't a sphere. H'Catha is a massive disk of outward flowing water from a mountain at the center called the Spindle. When the water gets a good distance away from the Spindle, it falls off of the gravity plane and dissipates in wildspace. H'Catha is home to a variety of beholders, most of which are at war with one another for control of the Spindle.": "我们的最后一颗行星，H'Catha，与迄今为止的所有其他行星不同，它不是一个球体。H'Catha是一个巨大的圆盘，由中心的一座叫做Spindle的山向外流动的水组成。当水离纺锤体有一段距离时，它就会从重力平面上掉下来，消散在荒野空间。H'Catha是各种持有者的家园，其中大多数都在为控制纺锤体而相互争斗。",
	"Greyspace is the home to the Greyhawk campaign setting, which takes place on its first planet, Oerth. Unlike Realmspace, Greyspace is geocentric, with its sun revolving around Oerth. Greyspace has a rich and diverse array of celestial bodies and gods that are all too happy to stay out of space. Like Realmspace, this means Greyspace is a favorite location for traders, adventurers, and mercenaries.": "灰空间是灰鹰战役背景的所在地，它的故事发生在它的第一个星球Oerth。与王国空间不同，灰色空间是以地心为中心的，其太阳围绕着Oerth旋转。灰空间拥有丰富多样的天体和诸神，他们都很乐意呆在太空之外。与王国空间一样，这意味着灰色空间是商人、冒险家和雇佣兵最喜欢的地方。",
	"For more detail on Greyspace, look up {@link SJR6 Greyspace (1992)|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17251/SJR6-Greyspace-2e} originally published by TSR, Inc.": "关于灰色空间的更多细节，请查阅（%0%）最初由TSR公司出版。",
	"Oerth is the main planet where the {@i Greyhawk} campaign setting takes place. It is situated at the center of its view of the universe, and many adventurers and powerful figures have egos that believe much the same about themselves. As a result, Oerth doesn't tend to care much about what's going on in wildspace. They are already the center of the universe, why care about being anywhere else?": "Oerth是{@i Greyhawk}战役设定发生的主要星球。它位于其宇宙观的中心，许多冒险家和有权势的人物都有自我，对自己的看法基本相同。因此，Oerth并不倾向于关心荒野空间发生了什么。他们已经是宇宙的中心，为什么还要关心其他地方？",
	"The next planet out is Celene. Although every planet in this geocentric system is technically a moon to Oerth, Celene can be distinguished in the sky of Oerth, making it more of a moon than the other planets past. Celene has no atmosphere and no active civilization. There are ruins there, but the difficulty in exploring a planet without an atmosphere is substantial and not many have cared to try exploring it yet.": "下一个出来的行星是Celene。尽管在这个地心系统中的每颗行星在技术上对Oerth来说都是一颗卫星，但Celene在Oerth的天空中可以被分辨出来，使它比过去的其他行星更像一颗卫星。塞林没有大气层，也没有活跃的文明。那里有遗迹，但探索一个没有大气层的星球的难度是很大的，还没有多少人愿意去尝试探索它。",
	"Luna is the second planet that, like Celene, is often thought of as a moon to Oerth because it can be distinguished against the sky from Oerth. Unlike Celene, Luna is not a dead planet, but one with a rich and diverse ecosystem extending all across the world What stands out about Luna is that there appear to be no more native intelligent species to the planet, only travelers who've settled down there. All native life on Luna is monstrous.": "Luna是第二颗行星，和Celene一样，经常被认为是Oerth的一颗卫星，因为它可以在天空中与Oerth区分开来。与Celene不同，Luna不是一个死寂的星球，而是一个有着丰富多样的生态系统的星球。 Luna的突出之处在于，这个星球似乎没有更多的本地智能物种，只有在那里定居的旅行者。月球上所有的本地生命都是畸形的。",
	"Liga is the third body out from Oerth and the star of the Greyspace sphere. The sun burns a bright gold but has tiny specks of blue within it.": "利加是离开厄尔士的第三个天体，是灰空间球体的明星。太阳燃烧着明亮的金色，但里面有微小的蓝色斑点。",
	"The Grinder is less of a planet and more of a massive asteroid field It surrounds Oerth on all sides, not just in a disk orbit, so no matter what approach one uses, they must contend with The Grinder. While some parts of The Grinder support wildjammer civilization, other parts are full of monstrous creatures and undead. Be wary when traveling through The Grinder.": "碾压者与其说是一颗行星，不如说是一个巨大的小行星场，它四面环绕着Oerth，而不仅仅是在圆盘轨道上，所以无论人们使用什么方法，他们都必须与碾压者抗衡。虽然研磨器的某些部分支持野蛮人的文明，但其他部分则充满了畸形的生物和亡灵。在研磨机中旅行时要小心谨慎。",
	"Edill is the first planet as we move out from The Grinder. It is an air planet with sporadic islands. Edill is primarily occupied by dragons who use these islands to lay eggs and protect their treasure hoards.": "埃迪尔是我们从研磨机出来后的第一个星球。它是一个有零星岛屿的空气星球。埃迪尔主要由龙占领，它们利用这些岛屿产卵并保护它们的宝藏。",
	"On the same orbital parth as Edill, but on the opposite side is Gnibile. Gnibile is an air body world that seems to have strong connections with the negative energy plane and undead things. It is not uncommon to hear stories of ghost wildjammers sailing out from Gnibile.": "与埃迪尔在同一个轨道上，但在对面的是Gnibile。Gnibile是一个空气体世界，似乎与负能量层和亡灵事物有很强的联系。从Gnibile驶出的鬼魂野战船的故事并不鲜见。",
	"The next planet out is Conatha. Conatha is a large oblong water planet with a pair of large chunks of earth at its core separated by a few thousand miles. As these two large chunks of earth revolve around one another at the core, the waters also move. This makes Conatha look almost like an ooze toppling over itself repeatedly as it orbits Oerth.  Conatha is full of sahuagin, whales, triton, and other aquatic creatures. Due to its odd orbit pattern, there are no islands.": "下一个星球是Conatha。科纳塔是一个大型的长方形水行星，其核心有一对大块的地球，相隔几千英里。当这两块大的地球在核心处互相旋转时，水也在移动。这使Conatha看起来几乎就像一个在围绕Oerth运行时反复倾倒的渗水体。 科纳塔充满了萨瓦金、鲸鱼、特里顿和其他水生生物。由于其奇怪的轨道模式，没有岛屿。",
	"Our next planet is a crescent shaped planet called Ginsel Ginsel looks like a planet with a large bite taken out of it.  There are creatures living in all sides and within it. There isn't much in the way of monstrosities or beasts on Ginsel, it's mostly feudal Europe civilizations warring with one another They are aware of wildjammers and will side with wildjammer folk so long as it helps them against their rivals.": "我们的下一个星球是一个月牙形的星球，叫Ginsel Ginsel看起来像一个被咬了一大口的星球。 在它的四面八方和内部都有生物生活。Ginsel上没有太多的怪兽或野兽，主要是欧洲的封建文明在互相争斗。他们知道野蛮人，只要能帮助他们对抗对手，就会站在野蛮人一边。",
	"Borka used to be a goblinoid stronghold before the Elven Imperial Navy had the planet destroyed during the Unhuman Wars. All that remains of Borka are vast small chunks of sandstone connected by a shared air envelope. The goblinoids who survived this destruction and still live on Borka attack anyone who gets close on sight. They can't afford word getting to the Elven Imperial Navy that there are still goblinoids living on Borka.": "在精灵帝国海军在非人类战争中摧毁这个星球之前，博尔卡曾经是一个地精族的据点。波尔卡只剩下巨大的小块砂岩，由一个共同的空气包络层连接。在这次毁灭中幸存下来并仍然生活在博尔卡上的地精们，一见到任何人就会攻击他们。他们不能让精灵帝国海军知道博尔卡上还住着妖精人的消息。",
	"Our next planet is really a collection of small planetoids called Greela. These planets are mostly lush, becoming increasingly dense with plant life as you get closer to the center of Greela. The primary occupants of Greela are elves, though each planetoid has its own ecosystem of predators.": "我们的下一个星球实际上是一个叫做Greela的小行星的集合。这些行星大部分都很茂盛，当你越接近格雷拉中心时，植物生命就越密集。格雷拉的主要居住者是精灵，尽管每个行星都有自己的捕食者生态系统。",
	"The final celestial body in Greyspace is the Spectre. It is named this because it seems to blink in and out of existence from the point of view of Oerth. In truth, the Spectre is a disk world that spins on its orbital path, meaning that a viewer from Oerth might see one of its two faces in full, or it may be flat and therefore practically invisible to a viewer from Oerth.": "灰空间的最后一个天体是 \"幽灵\"。它之所以被命名为 \"幽灵\"，是因为从Oerth的角度来看，它似乎是一闪一闪地存在着。事实上，幽灵是一个在其轨道上旋转的圆盘世界，这意味着从Oerth的视角可能会看到它两个面中的一个完整的面，或者它可能是平的，因此从Oerth的视角几乎看不到。",
	"There is no natural animal life on The Spectre, even though the disk could easily support it. This has made The Spectre a favorite location for wildjammers to set up outposts and cities for traveling ships.": "幽灵号上没有自然的动物生命，尽管这个圆盘可以很容易地支持它。这使得幽灵号成为野蛮人最喜欢的地点，为旅行船建立前哨和城市。",
	"Krynnspace is home to the {@i Dragonlance} campaign setting.  Relative to Greyspace and Realmspace, the gods of Krynnspace are few in number but significantly more active and meddlesome in the affairs of mortals. This makes travelers a bit wary of this sphere.": "Krynnspace是{@i Dragonlance}竞选环境的所在地。 相对于灰空间和境界空间，克里恩空间的神灵数量不多，但明显更活跃，对凡人的事务更爱管闲事。这使得旅行者对这个领域有些警惕。",
	"For more detail on Krynnspace, look up {@link SJR7 Krynnspace (1993)|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17254/SJR7-Krynnspace-2e} originally published by TSR, Inc.": "更多关于Krynnspace的细节，请查阅{@link SJR7 Krynnspace (1993)|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17254/SJR7-Krynnspace-2e}最初由TSR公司发布。",
	"To date, no one has discovered anything unique about the sun of Krynnspace.": "迄今为止，没有人发现克里恩空间的太阳有什么独特之处。",
	"Sirion is the first planet out from the Sun. As one would expect, it is a fire body planet. The surface is cool enough to allow a crust of basalt to form for fire creatures like salamanders and efreet, but it remains hot enough that the surface is constantly shifting. Only around the north and south pole is there any amount of geographical stability.": "天狼星是离开太阳的第一颗行星。正如人们所期望的，它是一个火体行星。它的表面足够凉爽，可以形成玄武岩地壳，供蝾螈和伊夫雷特等火系生物使用，但它仍然足够热，以至于表面不断变化。只有在南极和北极周围才有一定的地理稳定性。",
	"The next planet out is Reorx. It is an earth body planet, but unlike those we've talked about so far, Reorx is not smooth.  The entire surface is covered in ravines, tall mountains, and deep chasms. It's almost like a ball of clay that has been badly scratched all over the surface by a cat. All bodies of water exist within these chasms, sometimes reaching up to the top.  'They are not wide or circular, they are always in these long cuts across the surface of the planet.": "下一个出场的行星是Reorx。它是一个土体行星，但与我们迄今为止谈到的那些不同，Reorx并不光滑。 整个表面布满了沟壑、高大的山脉和深邃的鸿沟。它几乎就像一个被猫严重抓伤的粘土球，表面到处都是。所有的水体都存在于这些鸿沟之中，有时甚至可以到达顶部。 '它们不宽也不圆，总是以这些长长的切口横跨地球的表面。",
	"The planet is inhabited by dwarves, Krynnish gnomes, and mind flayers. It also has a single moon called The Hammer.": "这颗星球上居住着矮人、克莱恩地精和心灵分裂者。它也有一颗名为 \"锤子 \"的卫星。",
	"Krynn is the center of humanoid activity in Krynnspace and the location of the Dragonlance campaign setting. It is an earthike planet covered in the ruins of an ancient advanced civilization that was destroyed by a meteor strike (potentially from the gods). Krynn has 3 moons named Nuitari, Lunitari, and Solitari. All are uninhabited, though Krynnish gnomes have been seen exploring them from time to time.": "Krynn是Krynnspace中人类活动的中心，也是《龙之谷》战役设定的所在地。它是一个像地球一样的星球，覆盖着一个被流星撞击（可能是来自神的）摧毁的古代先进文明的遗迹。Krynn有三个卫星，分别是Nuitari、Lunitari和Solitari。所有这些卫星都无人居住，尽管有人看到克莱恩的地精不时地在探索它们。",
	"Our next planet is Chislev, an incredibly dense forest world.  Although it is technically an earth body planet, at this point it is called a 'living world' because plants grow everywhere, including on and from other plants. This means you're unlikely to ever find the ground without a lot of hard work cutting down into thicket. Weather is always stormy and rainy on Chislev. Traditional humanoids don't find Chislev to be a good place to live. Instead, it is giants and dragons who primarily live on Chisley, hunting the monstrous and gargantuan wildlife of the planet.": "我们的下一个星球是奇斯利夫，一个极其茂密的森林世界。 虽然从技术上讲，它是一个土体行星，但在这一点上，它被称为 \"活的世界\"，因为植物到处生长，包括在其他植物上和从其他植物上生长。这意味着如果不经过艰苦的砍伐，你不太可能找到地面上的灌木丛。Chislev上的天气总是暴风雨，雨天。传统的人形生物并不觉得奇斯利夫是个好地方。相反，主要是巨人和龙居住在奇斯利，猎杀这个星球上的畸形和巨大的野生动物。",
	"The final planet in Krynnspace is Zivilyn, an air body world.  There are continent sized boulders that fly around within Zivilyn, but it isn't particularly conducive to humanoid living.  Even dragons don't make their home in Zivilyn, likely due to the lack of wildlife to hunt for food. The main living creatures in Zivilyn are the crews of wrecked wildjammers or miners left behind from abandoned expeditions. Zivilyn has twelve moons, all of which are earth bodied.": "克林空间的最后一颗行星是齐维林，一个空气体世界。 齐维林内有大陆大小的巨石飞来飞去，但它并不特别有利于人形生物的生活。 即使是龙也不在兹维林安家，可能是因为缺乏可供猎取食物的野生动物。齐维林的主要生物是失事的野战船船员或被遗弃的探险队留下的矿工。齐维林有12颗卫星，都是土生土长的。",
	"The {@i Astromundi Cluster} is a campaign setting created for Wildjammer to occupy the sphere called Clusterspace. This sphere is larger than any of the others discussed so far, so rather than go over an entire campaign setting, I'm going to review the broad ideas presented in the original material.": "{@i Astromundi Cluster}是为Wildjammer创建的一个战役设置，占据了名为Clusterspace的球体。这个球体比迄今为止讨论的任何其他球体都要大，所以我不打算去看整个战役设定，而是要回顾一下原始材料中提出的大致想法。",
	"For more detail on Clusterspace, look up {@link The Astromundi Cluster (1993)|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17243/The-Astromundi-Cluster-2e}, originally published by TSR, Inc.": "关于集群空间的更多细节，请查阅（%0%），最初由TSR公司发布。",
	"Clusterspace is an easy sphere to get into, but difficult to escape. It has rivers leading to it from Krynnspace, Greyspace, and Realmspace, yet it is often avoided Wildjammers find it easy to find portals to get in, but portals leading out are nearly non-existent and inaccessible to normal wildjammers even when found. Only the living ships of the Elven Imperial Navy seem to be able to escape.": "集群空间是一个容易进入的球体，但很难逃脱。它有河流从克林空间、灰色空间和境界空间通向它，但它经常被避开。野战者发现很容易找到进入的门户，但通往外面的门户几乎不存在，即使找到了，普通野战者也无法进入。只有精灵帝国海军的活体船似乎能够逃脱。",
	"As you might imagine from the name, most celestial bodies in Clusterspace are clusters of small objects. There are numerous asteroid belts, a pair of suns, large nebulae made up of space debris and gas, and so on. Most civilization you find in Clusterspace is going to be made on clusters of asteroids that are connected by bridges and ladders.": "正如你从名字中可以想象的那样，星团空间中的大多数天体都是小天体的星团。有许多小行星带，一对太阳，由空间碎片和气体组成的大星云，等等。你在星团空间发现的大多数文明都是在由桥梁和梯子连接的小行星群上形成的。",
	"Clusterspace has just about every species you've ever imagined trapped there. The neogi and illithids make for common enemies, but other people trying to escape are just as dangerous.": "集群空间有几乎所有你想象过的物种被困在那里。neogi和illithids是共同的敌人，但其他试图逃跑的人也同样危险。",
	"Although this makes it sound like Clusterspace is a blank slate, many of the destroyed planets that now make up the clusters of floating space debris hold ancient ruins that suggest Clusterspace is the origin sphere of the mind flayers.": "虽然这让人觉得群星空间是一块白板，但许多被摧毁的星球现在构成了漂浮的空间碎片群，它们拥有古老的遗迹，这表明群星空间是思想驱逐者的起源球。",
	"According to {@i CGR1 The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook (1992)}, Ravenloft as a setting exists in a demiplane rather than in a crystal sphere. The main way a Ravenloft campaign begins is with an adventuring party getting caught up in a random appearance of the Mists of Ravenloft. The same can be true for a wildjammer crew! The Mists of Ravenloft can reach to anywhere in wildspace in any sphere. The only place a wildjammer crew would never run into the Mists of Ravenloft is in the phlogiston.": "根据{@i CGR1 The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook (1992)}，拉文洛夫特作为一个设定存在于一个半位面而不是一个水晶球中。拉文洛夫特战役开始的主要方式是冒险队伍被随机出现的拉文洛夫特迷雾所吸引。同样的情况也可以发生在野蛮人的队伍中。拉文洛夫特的迷雾可以到达任何范围内的荒野空间的任何地方。荒野猎人团队唯一不会遇到雷文洛夫特之雾的地方是在菲力浦。",
	"If a wildjammer ends up in Ravenloft, it functions as normal, except that if it travels too far away, the mists bring it back to Barovia.": "如果一个野蛮人最终出现在拉文洛夫特，它的功能和正常一样，只是如果它走得太远，迷雾会把它带回巴洛维亚。",
	"Eberron was originally published in 2004 by Wizards of the Coast, a decade after Wildjammer had stopped being published, As a result, we never really got much in how Eberron fits within Wildjammer's model of the universe. This leaves it up to the DM to decide how they wish to handle including Eberron in their game world. Perhaps it is in a parallel dimension, a pocket of the material plane, or simple so far away and the sphere is only accessible through a black hole. However you choose to do it, Eberron was intentionally segmented off from the rest of D&D.": "Eberron最初于2004年由Wizards of the Coast出版，在Wildjammer停止出版的十年之后，因此我们从未真正了解Eberron如何适合Wildjammer的宇宙模型。这就使得DM可以决定他们希望如何处理将Eberron纳入他们的游戏世界。也许它是在一个平行维度上，是物质世界的一个口袋，或者简单到只能通过黑洞进入球体。无论你如何选择，Eberron都被有意地与D&D的其他部分分割开来。",
	"Many of the Magic the Gathering settings have been getting published in D&D 5e, be it through full campaign settings like {@book Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (2018)|ggr} or {@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros (2000)|mot} or in the {@i Plane Shift} series. So how do these fit in Wildjammer?": "许多《魔法集结号》的设定已经在D&D 5e中发布，无论是通过完整的战役设定，如{@book Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (2018)|ggr}或{@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros (2000)|mot}还是{@i Plane Shift}系列。那么，这些在《荒野大镖客》中是如何体现的呢？",
	"In terms of lore, they really don't. In classic Magic the Gathering lore, each world is its own universe and planeswalkers are the only ones who travel between them.  You couldn't simply fly up from Theros through Nyx and eventually get to Ravnica, as the universe has a solid ending point. In that way, it's more like Ravenloft.": "就传说而言，他们真的不知道。在经典的《魔力集结》传说中，每个世界都是自己的宇宙，而行者是唯一能在它们之间旅行的人。 你不可能简单地从塞洛斯（Theros）飞过尼克斯（Nyx）并最终到达拉夫尼卡（Ravnica），因为这个宇宙有一个坚实的终点。从这个角度来说，它更像《雷文洛夫特》。",
	"When it comes to using Magic the Gathering settings in a Wildjammer game, you simply need to relax the rigidity of that part of the lore. Many of these settings already are established as planets or moons, it's just that there's nothing if you sail out into space. So instead of saying it just ends, put the threshold of a crystal sphere there. Some settings might do better as a plane instead of a sphere, like Lorwyn. Lorwyn is full of fairy tale creatures brutally killing one another over and over. That would fit nicely in the Feywild perhaps demi-plane of the Feywild.": "当谈到在Wildjammer游戏中使用Magic the Gathering的设定时，你只需要放松那部分传说的僵化。许多这样的设定已经被确立为行星或卫星，只是如果你驶向太空，就什么都没有了。所以与其说它只是结束，不如把水晶球的门槛放在那里。有些环境可能作为一个平面而不是一个球体更好，比如洛温。洛温充满了童话故事中的生物，它们一次又一次地残酷地互相残杀。这将很适合于Feywild，也许是Feywild的半平面。",
	"The Rock of Bral is a vibrant city built upon a one mile long asteroid with labyrinthine tunnels between the two sides. It was originally created by the Wildjammer team as a hub city that can be put anywhere as the DM requires.": "布拉尔之石是一个充满活力的城市，它建立在一个一英里长的小行星上，两边是迷宫般的隧道。它最初是由Wildjammer团队创建的，作为一个枢纽城市，可以按照DM的要求放在任何地方。",
	"For more details on the Rock of Bral, look up {@link SJR5 Rock of Bral (1992)|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17264/SJR5-Rock-of-Bral-2e} originally published by TSR, Inc.": "关于布拉尔岩石的更多细节，请查阅（%0%），最初由TSR公司出版。",
	"The Rock of Bral's history started about 150 years ago when pirates started making use of it for their bases. It had been occupied before, but those occupants were long since gone.  Ina short time, a bandit king named Cozar managed to bring all of the other pirates on the Rock under his sway. Over time and under his rule, the Rock started to become a more legitimate settlement instead of just a pirate's den. As the city grew, Cozar eventually put out a public ban on piracy as a means to drive more trade through the Rock.": "布拉尔岩石的历史始于大约150年前，当时海盗开始利用它作为他们的基地。它以前曾被占领过，但那些占领者早已不在了。 在很短的时间内，一个名叫科扎尔的强盗国王成功地将岩石上的所有其他海盗置于他的控制之下。随着时间的推移，在他的统治下，岩石城开始成为一个更合法的定居点，而不仅仅是一个海盗窝。随着城市的发展，科扎尔最终公开禁止了海盗行为，以此来推动更多的贸易在岩石上进行。",
	"That said, piracy remains in the lifeblood of the Rock.  While committing piracy around the Rock is responded to, everyone sort of looks the other way if you are a pirate looking to fence some goods you got elsewhere. The worst crime is that which endangers the Rock itself. Prisoners found guilty are gifted to the illithid embassy.": "也就是说，海盗行为仍然是岩石城的命脉。 虽然在岩石周围实施海盗行为会受到打击，但如果你是一个想把从其他地方得到的货物销赃的海盗，大家都会睁一只眼闭一只眼。最严重的罪行是危及岩石本身的罪行。被认定有罪的囚犯会被赠送给伊利希德大使馆。",
	"Cozar's son, Frun, wasn't as efficient a leader as his father.  It was during this time that the ruling house started to delegate more tasks to various factions on the Rock. Many different factions and royalty started to arise.": "科扎尔的儿子弗伦并不像他父亲那样是个高效的领导者。 正是在这一时期，统治者开始将更多的任务委托给岩石上的各个派别。许多不同的派别和王室开始出现。",
	"When Frun died, his eldest son Calar took over. Within a week, Calar was assassinated, passing the throne on to Andru, the younger son. Unlike his elder brother and father, Andru took after his grandfather. Within a week, Andru claimed to have found the assassins and had them executed.  Yet, rumors go around that the alleged assassins were actually people Andru owed money to and he conspired to kill his older brother to get the throne and remove those he was indebted to. No one knows for sure.": "弗伦死后，他的长子卡拉尔接任。一周之内，卡拉尔被暗杀，将王位传给了小儿子安德鲁。与他的兄长和父亲不同，安德鲁继承了他的祖父。一周之内，安德鲁声称已经找到了刺客，并将他们处决。 然而，有传言说，所谓的刺客其实是安德鲁欠下的人，他密谋杀死他的哥哥，以获得王位，并清除他所欠下的人。没有人知道是怎么回事。",
	"Whatever happened, Prince Andru of Bral is but one player in the politics of the Rock of Bral. There are now many factions and embassies that struggle for power over the Rock, as well as the constant threat to dangers still lurking inside the Rock that has yet to be fully explored.": "无论发生了什么，布拉尔的安德鲁王子只是布拉尔岩石政治中的一个角色。现在有许多派别和使馆在争夺岩石的权力，以及对仍然潜伏在岩石内部的危险的不断威胁，这些危险还没有被完全探索出来。",
	"The gravity plane of the Rock of Bral separates the asteroid into an upper and lower part. The upper half is the city proper, called the City of Bral. The lower half is reserved entirely for the Prince.": "布拉尔岩石的重力面将小行星分成上下两部分。上半部分是城市本身，称为布拉尔城。下半部分则完全保留给王子。",
	"The city is located on the upper half of the Rock. There are two parts: The High City and the Low City. The High City is on the more elevated part of the asteroid and houses Prince Andru's castle. The Low City is the rest of the city. A wall separates these two parts from one another.": "该市位于岩石的上半部。有两个部分。高城和低城。高城位于小行星较高的部分，里面有安德鲁王子的城堡。低城是城市的其他部分。一道墙将这两部分相互隔开。",
	"The Rock of Bral has a big hole going right through it. This hole is filled with water that gathers around the gravity plane running through the Rock. This means the lake has a top on both sides of the Rock. Various creatures live in the water as a means to clean up filth and waste.": "布拉尔的岩石有一个大洞，直接穿过它。这个洞里的水聚集在贯穿岩石的重力平面周围。这意味着湖水在岩石的两边都有一个顶部。各种生物生活在水中，作为清理污垢和废物的手段。",
	"The Rock has an edge on both sides that fall off sharply.  Guard posts are set up along the edge to watch for anyone unfortunate enough to have fallen off.": "岩石的两边都有一个急剧下降的边缘。 沿着边缘设置了岗哨，以监视任何不幸跌落的人。",
	"The underside is the lower part of the Rock. This area is entirely the property of Prince Andru and it hosts a private fleet of wildjammers. Also visible from the underside are the Vanes, large wing-like constructs that extend out to allow some limited control of how the Rock is drifting.": "底部是岩石的下半部分。这个区域完全是安德鲁王子的财产，这里有一支私人的野战船队。从底部还可以看到帆状物，这些大型的翼状物延伸出来，可以有限地控制岩石的漂移。",
	"The thinner portion of the Rock has a set of extensive wooden docks to accept all travelers to the city. A wildjammer that attempts to land in the city will likely find themselves under arrest quite quickly. Just off to the side of the wooden docks is a dry-dock for wildjammers that can land on land.": "岩石较薄的部分有一套广泛的木制码头，接受所有前往城市的旅行者。试图在城市中登陆的野人可能会很快发现自己被逮捕。在木制码头的一侧是一个干船坞，供可以在陆地上登陆的野战船使用。",
	"Inside of the asteroid between the upper and lower half are the caverns. These labyrinthine caves are largely the result of creatures that once lived on the Rock well before Cozar first took it over. These caverns have not been fully explored though they are sometimes used for moving from one side of the Rock to the other. Few seem particularly interested in stirring up whatever might be waiting deep within.": "在小行星的上半部和下半部之间的内部是岩洞。这些迷宫般的洞穴主要是在科扎尔首次占领岩石之前，曾经生活在岩石上的生物所造成的。这些洞穴还没有被完全开发，尽管它们有时被用来从岩石的一侧移动到另一侧。似乎很少有人对搅动可能在深处等待的东西特别感兴趣。",
	"Much of the real estate of the Rock is devoted to markets.  Given that many of the original founders of the Rock were pirates, there was a lot of stuff to sell off and so many shops were created. There is a central Great Market that resides toward the center of the Low City. On the other side of the Low City is the Lesser Market where shady dealings happen.": "岩石城的大部分房地产都是用于市场。 鉴于岩石城的许多原始创建者都是海盗，有很多东西需要出售，因此创建了许多商店。有一个中央大市场，位于低城的中心。在低城的另一边是小市场，那里发生着不光彩的交易。",
	"There are five major districts to the Rock of Bral set up by species that grouped together early on in the founding of the Rock. There is The Burrows for halflings, the Dwarven District, the Dracon Enclave, the Forest for elves, and Giff 'Town for the Giff. Each of these is run by factions focused on the interest of their species on the Rock.": "布拉尔之岩有五个主要的地区，都是在建立之初就组合在一起的物种所设立的。半身人的洞穴区、矮人区、龙人飞地、精灵的森林区和吉夫人的吉夫镇。每一个都是由专注于其物种在岩石上的利益的派别管理。",
	"There are temples to various gods on the Rock just near Lake Bral They include churches to The Path and the Way and to the temple of Ptah.": "在布拉尔湖附近的岩石上有供奉各种神灵的庙宇，其中包括供奉路径和道路的教堂以及供奉普塔的庙宇。",
	"Not many can afford to be buried here. Most are instead burned or set adrift in space.": "没有多少人能够埋葬在这里。大多数人被烧掉或漂流到太空。",
	"The Donjon is the name of the Crown's prison for criminals judged too dangerous to be allowed to work off their crime.": "冬宫是皇家监狱的名称，用于关押被判定为太危险的罪犯，不允许他们以工代赈。",
	"The Festival Grounds were built over the damage done by a neogi controlled dwarven citadel crashing into the Rock.  Instead of rebuilding city, they put in grounds for festivals and built an arena.": "节日场地是在一个由Neogi控制的矮人城堡撞向岩石造成的破坏上建造的。 他们没有重建城市，而是为节日活动提供场地，并建造了一个竞技场。",
	"Located in the High City, the barracks houses the military of Prince Andru of Bral.": "这座军营位于高城，是布拉尔王子安德鲁的军队所在地。",
	"This chapter is all about DMing! So far this supplement has covered the universal model, player options, ship mechanics, and even some setting materials you can lo choose to use to add people and places to your world. But what about running the game? What about things that will pop up once we start DMing a game? Well, that's what we're going to be going over in this chapter. I can't say I'll cover everything, but I'm going to try to cover enough to smooth over some potential problems when running a game of Wildjammer.": "这一章是关于DMing的! 到目前为止，本补编已经涵盖了通用模型、玩家选项、飞船机制，甚至还有一些你可以选择使用的设定材料，来为你的世界添加人物和地点。但是，关于游戏的运行呢？一旦我们开始管理游戏，那些会冒出来的东西怎么办？嗯，这就是我们在这一章中要讨论的内容。我不能说我会涵盖所有的东西，但我会试着涵盖足够多的东西，以便在运行Wildjammer游戏时顺利解决一些潜在问题。",
	"That said, it is important to understand that this chapter is just guidelines. This is just a bunch of stuff that I have found help me when running a game. You may not agree and want to run stuff a different way. Go for it! The only wrong way to run a game is one where you and your players aren't having fun.": "这就是说，重要的是要理解这一章只是指南。这只是一堆我发现在运行游戏时对我有帮助的东西。你可能不同意，并想用不同的方式来运行东西。那就去做吧。唯一错误的游戏运行方式就是你和你的玩家都没有乐趣。",
	"Any game of Wildjammer is invariably going to end up with someone asking about a trip, \"How long does it take to get there?\". On the surface, this question is no more difficult to answer than telling your party how long it will take them to get down the road to the big city they are heading for. You might have a map that shows you distances, you might have it written down in your notes, or you might just make it up on the spot.": "任何一个Wildjammer游戏最后都会有人问到旅行的问题，\"到那里需要多长时间？\"。从表面上看，这个问题并不难回答，就像告诉你的聚会要花多长时间才能走到他们要去的大城市的路上。你可能有一张显示距离的地图，你可能把它写在你的笔记里，或者你可能只是在现场编造它。",
	"You can answer this question the same way in a Wildjammer game. Nothing about running a game in space requires you to map out every detail of every system, including planetary orbital motion. You can if that's something you enjoy, but you don't have to.": "在Wildjammer游戏中，你可以用同样的方式回答这个问题。在太空中运行游戏并不要求你绘制出每个系统的每一个细节，包括行星轨道运动。如果你喜欢，你可以这样做，但你不需要这样做。",
	"In this section, I'm going to run through a few travel related rules and tidbits of information that may help you depending on how you like to handle travel!": "在本节中，我将介绍一些与旅行有关的规则和花絮，这些信息可能对你有所帮助，这取决于你喜欢如何处理旅行问题",
	"There's at least two things for you to consider when it comes to a party setting sail between planets. First, how do they intend to navigate to their destination? Second, how long does it take to get there?": "当涉及到一个在行星之间起航的政党时，至少有两件事需要你考虑。第一，他们打算如何航行到目的地？第二，到达那里需要多长时间？",
	"Navigation in space can be fairly easy thanks to the stars all around. When getting ready to set sail, you can simply require the players to make a Navigator's Tools check to plot a course to their destination.": "由于周围都是星星，在太空中导航可以相当容易。当准备起航时，你可以简单地要求玩家做一个导航工具检查，以绘制通往目的地的路线。",
	"If you want it to be more difficult or if they are in an unfamiliar sphere, you might require them to first get a hold of a Star Chart. A star chart isn't some magic item, it's more of a reference chart for how the system works. It shows the orbital path of the known planets there and how to plot a course to them based on the stars. This would allow a crew to plot a course even when they have no basis for understanding the stars they are looking at. I generally make it so star charts can be purchased for between 100gp and 600gp at any port in one of the surrounding crystal spheres.": "如果你想让它更难，或者如果他们在一个不熟悉的领域，你可能会要求他们先掌握一张星图。星图并不是什么神奇的东西，它更像是一张关于该系统如何运作的参考图。它显示了那里的已知行星的轨道，以及如何根据星图绘制一条通往它们的路线。这将使船员在没有了解他们所看的星星的基础上也能绘制出一条路线。我一般会让星图在周围水晶球中的任何一个港口以100gp到600gp的价格购买。",
	"These rules might be useful for more theater of mind travel, but if you want to build a scale map that you can move planet tokens around on, you want to use the Planetary Display!": "这些规则可能对更多的心灵旅行很有用，但如果你想建立一个可以在上面移动行星令牌的比例尺地图，你要使用行星显示器！你可以用它。",
	"In the dropbox with this supplement, there is an image called the planetary display. This shows a pair of circles, each comprised of rings. These rings are orbits that a planet or similar can be on centered around a sun or other primary. Each ring is divided up into squares that you can place tokens on and move them along the ring as they revolve. The first ring out from the center has 6 blocks, the second ring has 12, the third ring has 18, and so on.": "在这个补充文件的下载箱中，有一张名为行星显示的图片。它显示了一对圆圈，每个圆圈都是由环组成的。这些环是行星或类似物体围绕太阳或其他主要物体的轨道。每个环都被划分为多个方块，你可以在上面放置代币，并在它们旋转时沿着环移动。从中心出来的第一个环有6块，第二个环有12块，第三个环有18块，以此类推。",
	"The two circles represent the inner and outer system. All of the right side circle is contained within the center of the left side circle. The right side represents the inner system, planets like Mercury or Mars. On the left display, we have the outer system, for planets far away from one another, like Jupiter or Neptune.": "这两个圆圈代表内部和外部系统。所有右边的圆都包含在左边圆的中心。右侧代表内系统，像水星或火星这样的行星。在左边的显示屏上，我们有外系统，为远离彼此的行星，如木星或海王星。",
	"On each circle, you can determine the scale. Lets say we know our ship moves 100 million miles a day, so we make a square on the right equal to 50 million miles. Our ship can move two squares per day. When scaling this up on the right display, multiply by 20. Nowa square is a billion miles, or 10 days of travel. This is to show how much closer things are in the inner system than in the outer system.": "在每个圆圈上，你可以确定比例。假设我们知道我们的船每天移动1亿英里，所以我们在右边做一个等于5千万英里的方块。我们的飞船每天可以移动两个方块。当在右边的显示屏上把这个比例放大时，乘以20。现在一个正方形就是10亿英里，或者10天的行程。这是为了显示在内部系统中的东西比外部系统中的东西要近得多。",
	"Remember that you can determine this scale! The goal is to give you the tools to show relative distances between planets over large distances.": "请记住，你可以决定这个比例! 我们的目标是给你提供工具，以显示大距离的行星之间的相对距离。",
	"For those of you familiar with Excel, you might find this useful. Back in 2016, Lord Torath, a contributor on The Piazza shared a neat {@link Excel sheet|https://www.thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=15437&sid=63566002267c02896cf1b092f5c2a3c6}. On this sheet, you can put in your planet's names, sizes, orbital speeds, and the like. Once it is done, you can override the \"Starting Position\" column's equations with flat integers and it will give you a set display. You can give the worksheet your party's travel speed and two planets and it will tell you the time it takes to travel between the two. If you change the time elapsed cell at the top of the page, it will automatically move every planet around the display and recalculate distances. If you're a fan of Excel, you'll find this useful!": "对于那些熟悉Excel的人来说，你可能会发现这很有用。早在2016年，The Piazza上的贡献者Lord Torath分享了一个整洁的（%0%）。在这张表上，你可以输入你的星球的名称、大小、轨道速度等等。一旦完成，你可以用平坦的整数覆盖 \"起始位置 \"栏的方程式，它就会给你一个设定的显示。你可以给工作表提供你方的旅行速度和两颗行星，它将告诉你在两颗行星之间旅行所需的时间。如果你改变了页面顶部的时间流逝单元格，它就会自动在显示屏上移动每颗行星并重新计算距离。如果你是一个Excel的粉丝，你会发现这很有用",
	"In a narrative sense, traveling between spheres can be handled quite easily. The phlogiston and the spheres within are all moving around slowly. At certain spots in the phlogiston, there are flow rivers, invisible currents that can be felt by and used by a Helmsman to sail the phlogiston. These rivers invariably lead between crystal spheres, like the strings of a spider's web leading to intersections. Traveling from one sphere to the next can be as simple as the party leaving their current crystal sphere and following a flow river all the way to their destination.": "在叙述的意义上，球体之间的旅行可以很容易处理。活塞和其中的球体都在缓慢移动。在活塞的某些地方，有流动的河流，这是看不见的水流，舵手可以感觉到并利用它来航行活塞。这些河流总是通向水晶球之间，就像蜘蛛网的绳索通向交叉点。从一个球体到下一个球体的旅行可以很简单，只要当事人离开他们当前的水晶球体，沿着流动的河流一直走到目的地。",
	"Alternatively, you can make use of a flow map. In the dropbox with this supplement, you'll find a copy of Nerik's Map of the Flow, a fantastic homebrew map that gives relative placement for many crystal spheres and approximate travel time along flow rivers between them. If you like using maps like this, you can use this similar to a nautical map, showing the best routes across the world's waterways.": "另外，你也可以利用流动地图。在本补充资料的下载箱中，你会发现一份Nerik's Map of the Flow的副本，这是一张奇妙的自制地图，它给出了许多水晶球的相对位置，以及它们之间沿流动河流的大致旅行时间。如果你喜欢使用这样的地图，你可以使用这个类似于航海地图的东西，显示穿越世界水路的最佳路线。",
	"Anyone proficient in Navigator's Tools can spend some time to notice a planet among the stars by noting how they move, but how close to do you need to be to just see the planet? This varies by planet size, as a bigger planet can be seen farther away, but my rule of thumb is that you can distinguish the planet from the stars when you're within 300 million miles (3 days travel).": "任何精通导航仪工具的人都可以花一些时间通过注意它们的运动方式来注意到恒星中的行星，但你需要多近才能仅仅看到行星？这因行星的大小而不同，因为更大的行星可以在更远的地方看到，但我的经验法则是，当你在3亿英里范围内（3天的行程），你就可以把行星从星星中区分出来。",
	"In most games of D&D, there is more than a little bit of combat. Whether it is the adventurers fighting for their lives through the labyrinthine caverns of the Underdark, or them ending up in a fight against the corrupt guards protecting a vampire's estate, one way or another, combat comes up.": "在大多数D&D游戏中，都有不止一点点的战斗。无论是冒险者在地下世界的迷宫般的洞穴中为自己的生命而战，还是他们在与保护吸血鬼庄园的腐败守卫的战斗中结束，或多或少都会出现战斗。",
	"Running combat in Wildjammer need not be any different than running it in any other setting, but there are some extra considerations.": "在Wildjammer中进行战斗与在其他环境中进行战斗没有任何区别，但有一些额外的考虑。",
	"Just like a sailor might someday end up in a fight with something beneath the water they sail on, sailors in Wildjammer might find themselves in the aether of wildspace. This forces them to fight in a particularly challenging environment.": "就像水手有一天可能会与他们航行的水面下的东西发生争斗一样，《荒野大镖客》中的水手可能会发现自己身处荒野空间的太虚之中。这迫使他们在一个特别具有挑战性的环境中战斗。",
	"When making a {@i melee weapon attack}, a creature that has no way to magically fly, levitate, hover, or in some way move while in the aether has disadvantage on the attack roll.": "当进行{@i melee weapon attack}时，没有办法用魔法飞行、悬浮、盘旋或以某种方式在乙太中移动的生物，在攻击卷上处于劣势。",
	"When making a {@i ranged weapon attack}, the weapon's normal range is doubled, but a creature that has no way to magically fly, levitate, hover, or in some way move while in the aether has disadvantage on the attack roll.": "当进行{@i ranged weapon attack}时，武器的正常射程会增加一倍，但在乙太中没有办法用魔法飞行、悬浮、盘旋或以某种方式移动的生物，在攻击卷上有劣势。",
	"In a groundling adventure in D&D 5e, we can make use of the CR system to have a general ballpark idea for how powerful a creature is. Unfortunately, that doesn't extend to ship combat. We can't just scale up a creature to mega scale and expect things to work out. As much as I've tried to make the ship combat mirror ground combat, it does differ, and it is important to take that into account when designing encounters.": "在D&D 5e的地面冒险中，我们可以利用CR系统来对一个生物的强大程度有一个大致的概念。不幸的是，这并没有延伸到船舶战斗中。我们不能只是把一个生物的规模扩大到巨型规模，并期望事情能够顺利进行。尽管我努力使飞船战斗与地面战斗相一致，但它确实不同，而且在设计遭遇战时必须考虑到这一点。",
	"Think of a standard party. Each character has their own amount of hit points, AC, magic items, features, features, and so on. When going into a fight, creature balance accounts for the fact that there are multiple player character targets, each with their own stats. This doesn't translate to ship combat where the ship defines the entire party's HP, AC, number of weapons, movement speed, and more. {@b What your party can do is constrained by the ship they are in.}": "想想看，一个标准的聚会。每个角色都有自己的命中率、AC值、魔法物品、特征、特性等等的数量。当进入战斗时，生物平衡考虑到有多个玩家角色目标的事实，每个人都有自己的属性。这并没有转化为船舶战斗，船舶定义了整个团队的HP、AC、武器数量、移动速度等等。{@b What your party can do is constrained by the ship they are in.}",
	"Lets dive into that a bit more. I think understanding how a ship constrains the party is important to cake ship scale encounters.": "让我们更深入地了解一下这个问题。我认为理解一艘船是如何制约党的，对蛋糕船规模的遭遇很重要。",
	"Lets imagine we have a level 15 party consisting of 5 player characters. Among them, we have a Helmsman, a Boatswain, and 3 Gunners. At level 15, they all have a 20 (+5) to their main offensive ability score with a proficiency bonus of +5.": "让我们想象一下，我们有一个15级的队伍，由5个玩家角色组成。其中，我们有一个舵手，一个船夫，和三个炮手。在15级时，他们的主要攻击能力得分都是20（+5），熟练度奖励为+5。",
	"Now lets put this party in a Dragonfly. This ship has 75 HP, 12 AC, and 1 light catapult. When one of the Gunners uses the light catapult, they have a +10 to hit and they deal 7 (3d4) mega bludgeoning damage per attack, plus 5 once per turn from the Gunner feature {@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais}. Assuming our Gunner is a Fighter with {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} (2), that means this ship can deal an average of 26 (7 + 7 + 7 + 5) mega damage each turn if every attack hits. That's pretty good when going against a Dragonfly or other low tier ship!": "现在让我们把这一方放在一艘蜻蜓号上。这艘船有75HP，12AC，和一个轻型弹射器。当其中一个炮手使用轻型弹射器时，他们有+10的命中率，每次攻击造成7（3d4）的巨大伤害，加上炮手特性（%0%）每回合5次。假设我们的炮手是一个拥有{@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5}(2)的战斗机，这意味着如果每次攻击都命中的话，这艘船每回合平均可以造成26(7+7+7+5)的巨额伤害。这在对抗蜻蜓或其他低级别的飞船时是非常好的!",
	"Lets put the same party in something bigger, a Hammership. Their ship has 250 HP, 16 AC, and 3 heavy catapults. The Gunners still have a +10 to hit, but now they deal 13 (3d8) mega bludgeoning damage per attack, plus 5 from the {@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais} Gunner feature. Furthermore, all 3 Gunners can make attacks, as the ship has more hardpoints. Lets say all Gunners are Fighters with {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} (2), that means they can do 44 a +13+13+5) each. That's a total of 132 damage if all attacks hit!": "让我们把同一批人放在更大的东西上，一艘锤子船。他们的船有250HP，16AC，和3个重型弹射器。炮手仍然有+10的命中率，但现在他们每次攻击会造成13（3d8）的巨大打击伤害，再加上{@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais}炮手特性的5。此外，所有3个炮手都可以进行攻击，因为这艘船有更多的硬点。假设所有的炮手都是拥有{@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5}(2)的战士，这意味着他们每个人可以造成44次+13+13+5的伤害。如果所有的攻击都命中了，那么总共有132个伤害。",
	"See how different this is? The same party in separate ships is a big change. The point I want to convey here is that when you are balancing your encounters, you need to design the offensive potential of your enemies based on the defensive potential of your party's ship. Your party will get better, but a ship is like a piece of equipment. It doesn't level up with you, it doesn't get better just because the characters aboard it are better. The characters can use weapons better (higher attack bonuses and the like), but the ship isn't changing.": "看看这有多大的不同？同一党派在不同的船只上是一个很大的变化。我想在这里表达的观点是，当你在平衡你的遭遇时，你需要根据你的一方的船的防御潜力来设计你的敌人的进攻潜力。你的队伍会变得更好，但船就像一件装备。它不会和你一起升级，也不会因为船上的人物更好而变得更好。角色可以更好地使用武器（更高的攻击加成等），但船并没有改变。",
	"Generally speaking, I recommend all DMs start out by designing mega creatures for their first ship combats. I recommend this because mega creatures are just big creatures designed for ship combat. This makes it much easier to run the encounter and to balance things against the party. I'll go into mega creatures more in the next section.": "一般来说，我建议所有的DM在一开始就为他们的第一次船战设计巨型生物。我推荐这样做是因为巨型生物只是为飞船战斗而设计的大型生物。这使得运行遭遇战和平衡事情对党的影响要容易得多。我将在下一节中详细介绍巨型生物。",
	"That said, you may reach a point where you want to throw an enemy ship at your party. After all, it is ship combat! I recommend you {@b design your enemy ships exactly like monsters.} In a normal D&D 5e game, we don't normally assign class levels to enemy creatures, we simply give them enough HP and AC to last, with enough attacks to hurt and create tension, and enough features to make the fight fun. Build your enemy ships in exactly the same way. Don't get bogged down on the exact stats of every bridge crew officer (except for use in a boarding fight). I never reference the creatures aboard the ship when running an enemy ship, I just build the ship's stat block to include whatever features I want it to have.": "也就是说，你可能会达到一个点，你想把敌人的飞船扔到你的队伍中。毕竟，这是船的战斗! 我建议你 {@b design your enemy ships exactly like monsters.} 在正常的D&D 5e游戏中，我们通常不会给敌人的生物分配等级，我们只是给他们足够的HP和AC来维持，有足够的攻击来伤害和制造紧张，有足够的特征来让战斗变得有趣。以完全相同的方式建造你的敌舰。不要纠结于每个舰桥人员的确切数据（除了在登船战斗中使用）。在运行敌舰时，我从不参考舰上的生物，我只是建立舰艇的状态块，包括我想让它具有的任何特征。",
	"That also means I don't worry about an enemy ship's bridge crew actions. If there is a bridge crew action | want the ship to be able to do, I'll make it a part of the ship's stat block. I'll always let a ship repair half of its bulwark points, move, and attack each turn, but something like a Captain's {@optfeature Fire At Will|wjmais} feature I just wrap up into the ship's multiattack.": "这也意味着我不担心敌舰的舰桥人员行动。如果有一个舰桥人员的行动，我想让这艘船能够做，我会让它成为这艘船的状态块的一部分。我总是让一艘船在每一回合修复一半的防波堤、移动和攻击，但像船长的{@optfeature Fire At Will|wjmais}功能，我只是把它包在船的多重攻击中。",
	"Throughout this supplement, I've mentioned mega creatures, but I haven't said much about them. This book doesn't have any mega creatures (other than the one that follows), but it is something a DM might want to add to their game. What's a ship sailing adventure without a kraken, without Charybdis and Scylla, without sharks circling and looking for a meal?": "在整个补编中，我提到了巨型生物，但对它们没有多说。本书没有任何巨型生物（除了下面这个），但它是一个DM可能想添加到他们的游戏中的东西。如果没有海怪，没有卡律布迪斯和希拉，没有鲨鱼盘旋着寻找食物，那还算什么船舶航行冒险？",
	"All mega creatures are treated as creatures scaled up to mega scale. They are so massive that they are larger than gargantuan. These mega creatures occupy at least a single 500 foot by 500 foot square on a mega scale grid. All mega creatures possess mega hit points instead of regular hit points Their movement and senses are also scaled up. Mega creatures can't be summoned by traditional magic and non-mega creatures cannot transform into them by magic.": "所有巨型生物都被视为按比例放大到巨型的生物。它们是如此巨大，以至于比巨无霸还大。这些巨型生物至少占据了一个500英尺乘500英尺的巨型格子。所有的巨型生物都拥有巨型的命中率，而不是普通的命中率，它们的移动和感官也是按比例增加的。巨型生物不能被传统的魔法所召唤，非巨型生物也不能通过魔法转化为它们。",
	"Unlike the normal creatures you see in fifth edition, I will not be providing a challenge rating. Consider a level 10 party in a Threshership. Even though they are level 10 and will be able to draw upon more class features and higher proficiency bonus for acting in ship combat, they are acting through a Threshership, one of the cheaper ships out there. If you were to throw them up against enemies with offensive capabilities to match the far more durable Hammership, the Threshership would get devoured.  As such, you need to balance your encounters to the party and their wildjammer.": "与你在第五版中看到的普通生物不同，我将不提供挑战等级。想想看，一个10级的队伍在长矛舰上。尽管他们是10级，并且能够利用更多的等级特征和更高的熟练度奖励来进行舰艇战斗，但他们是通过长矛船行动的，而长矛船是最便宜的船只之一。如果你让他们去对付那些拥有与更耐用的锤子船相媲美的进攻能力的敌人，长矛船会被吞噬。 因此，你需要平衡你的聚会和他们的野蛮人的遭遇。",
	"If you are a math person, you can feel free to dig into balancing that way. If you prefer to just feel things out, start simple! The sharchinid example is a nice easy encounter to start with. Start easy and work up in difficulty from there as you get used to the system.": "如果你是一个喜欢数学的人，你可以放心地去钻研平衡的方法。如果你更喜欢摸索，那就从简单的开始吧! sharchinid的例子是一个很好的简单遭遇，可以从它开始。从简单的开始，随着你对这个系统的习惯，难度会逐渐增加。",
	"Although I haven't put together a Monster Manual worth of mega creatures for this supplement, I figured it would make sense to at least share a couple of examples! I encourage you to tailor your mega creatures to your party and their particular abilities.": "虽然我还没有为这个补充版的巨型生物编写怪物手册，但我想至少分享几个例子是有意义的！我鼓励你根据你的派对和他们的特殊能力来定制你的巨型生物。我鼓励你根据你的队伍和他们的特殊能力来定制你的巨型生物。",
	"The two stat blocks included here are two I have used in my low to mid tier games in the past. Feel free to use these as is or build your own off of the ideas presented here. I'll again strongly recommend you check out the Dark Matter campaign setting by Mage Hand Press as that book has a number of interesting mega creatures that your party can encounter!": "这里包括的两个数据块是我过去在我的中低层游戏中使用过的。你可以按原样使用这些数据，或者根据这里的想法建立你自己的数据。我再次强烈建议你看看法师之手出版社的《黑暗物质》战役设定，因为该书有许多有趣的巨型生物，你的队伍可以遇到它们",
	"When running a Wildjammer game, you might run a game that takes place entirely in a city like the Rock of Bral. You might run a game that focuses on a small cluster of worlds. You might focus in on just one sphere. You might also like to have your players voyage across many spheres and see different settings.": "在运行Wildjammer游戏时，你可能会运行一个完全发生在布拉尔岩石这样的城市的游戏。你可能会运行一个专注于一小簇世界的游戏。你可能只专注于一个球体。你也可能喜欢让你的玩家在许多球体上航行，看到不同的环境。",
	"However you run your Wildjammer game, homebrew is in the lifeblood of this setting. You build your own ideas, your own worlds, your own villains, and so on.

The beauty of crystal spheres is that you can reasonably put any setting you can imagine into your Wildjammer universe.": "无论你如何运行你的Wildjammer游戏，自制都是这个设定的命脉。你可以建立你自己的想法，你自己的世界，你自己的反派，等等。这里有足够的设定材料，你可以在Eberron、Wildemont、Forgotten Realms等之间飞行，但你也可以加入你自己的设定材料! 水晶球的魅力在于，你可以合理地将任何你能想象到的设定放入你的Wildjammer宇宙。",

Do they have moons or odd creatures living upon them?": "外面有多少颗行星？有小行星带吗？它们是如何围绕主星运行的，是以圆形模式还是其他方式？它们是否自转，如果是，是以一种奇怪的方式还是不自转？对于每个行星，它们有多大？它们是火行星、土行星、水行星、空气行星，还是生命行星？它们是否有卫星或奇怪的生物生活在上面？",
	"Who in the sphere is aware of wildspace and spacefaring society? Are they friendly or hostile? What are their experiences with other spacefaring societies? How do they perceive the universe through a cultural, political, social, and religious lens?

	"In the original Spelljammer campaign setting, just as in this supplement, the phlogiston is a place beyond the reach of the planes and dimensional magic. This was done as a way to justify why the gods of different setting don't mess up the lore of other settings, which preserves each setting's integrity. In 2e Spelljammer though, this also meant that clerics, paladins, and others who derived their power from planar sources were also isolated from their more powerful spells. If you want some of this original flavor, use this rule.": "在最初的Spelljammer战役设定中，就像在本补充文件中一样，Phlogiston是一个平面和维度魔法无法到达的地方。这样做是为了证明为什么不同设定的神不会扰乱其他设定的传说，从而保留了每个设定的完整性。不过在2e Spelljammer中，这也意味着牧师、圣骑士和其他从平面来源获得力量的人也被隔离在他们更强大的法术之外。如果你想要一些这种原始风味，就使用这个规则。",
	"When using the Anti-Planar Phlogiston optional rule, spell slots don't return as normal. Clerics and paladins can only regain 1st and 2nd level spell slots when finishing a long rest while in the phlogiston.  Even paladins that serve a virtue or ideal are limited by this, as their service might not be to a deity, but a deity does sponsor the power to the paladin.": "当使用反平坦的Phlogiston可选规则时，法术槽不会像平常一样恢复。牧师和圣骑士只有当在活塞中完成长时间休息时才能恢复一阶和二阶的法术槽。 即使是为美德或理想服务的圣骑士也受此限制，因为他们的服务可能不是为神灵服务，但神灵确实赞助了圣骑士的力量。",
	"Warlocks are similarly limited. When a warlock regains spell slots on a short rest, these spell slots are limited to 2nd level, even if they would otherwise be cast at a higher level.": "术士也有类似的限制。当术士在短暂的休息中重新获得法术槽时，这些法术槽被限制在2级，即使它们本来可以在更高的级别上施放。",
	"When in crystal spheres where the divine entity that sponsors the character's power has no influence, the character must use the {@spell Contact Home Power|wjmais} or {@spell Detect Powers|wjmais} spell to establish a link to the divine benefactor or to temporarily gain power from a local power. If the character doesn't establish this link, they continue to only regain spell slots up to 2nd level until such time as their divine benefactor has power in that sphere.": "当在水晶球体中，赞助角色力量的神性实体没有影响力时，角色必须使用{@spell Contact Home Power|wjmais}或{@spell Detect Powers|wjmais}的咒语来建立与神性恩人的联系，或从当地的力量中暂时获得力量。如果角色没有建立这种联系，他们继续只能恢复二级以下的法术槽，直到他们的神圣恩人在该领域拥有力量时为止。",
	"Ship combat in Wildjammer is meant to mirror ground combat as closely as possible while still retaining the feeling of being in a ship, so there isn't anything like a critical hit chart for ship fights. Nevertheless, if you want to have devastating critical effects, you can use the Critical Effects table provided below.": "荒野大镖客》中的舰艇战斗是为了尽可能地反映地面战斗，同时仍然保留在舰艇中的感觉，所以没有任何类似于舰艇战斗的关键打击表。尽管如此，如果你想拥有毁灭性的关键效果，你可以使用下面提供的关键效果表。",

	"A ship weapon, module, or sails is broken! Until the Boatswain takes the {@optfeature Fix It Up|wjmais} bridge crew action to repair it, it is inactive and unusable.

The attacker chooses which ship component is damaged.": "一艘船的武器、模块或船帆被破坏了! 在船夫采取{@optfeature Fix It Up|wjmais}的舰桥人员行动来修复它之前，它是不活跃的，无法使用。武器不能发射，模块不能使用，船帆也不能用来转向。攻击者可以选择哪个船的部件被损坏。",
	"The power of the attack has knocked everyone aboard the ship off balance. The first attack made by each Gunner before the end of their next turn is made at disadvantage. If the ship suffers additional instances of Ship Shaken in the same turn, the number of attacks made at disadvantage increases by 1 each.": "攻击的力量使船上的每个人都失去了平衡。每个炮手在下一回合结束前进行的第一次攻击都是以劣势进行的。如果该船在同一回合内遭受到额外的 \"船震 \"实例，则以劣势进行的攻击次数各增加1次。",

	"Since Wildjammer is based on the Age of Sail, there is going to be a great deal of downtime between events.  Sailing the high seas is great, but you're not likely to get 7 encounters into an adventuring day when sailing.  When there is just 1 encounter a day, it often leads to characters 'going nova' and using all their strong abilities and trivializing encounters because there's only going to be one in the day. To account for this, you may wish to apply this revised version of the Gritty Realism rules.": "由于Wildjammer是以航海时代为基础的，事件之间会有大量的停顿时间。 在公海上航行是很好的，但是在航行时，你不可能在一个冒险日里有7次遭遇。 当一天只有一次奇遇时，往往会导致角色 \"变成新星\"，使用他们所有的强大能力，并使奇遇变得微不足道，因为一天中只有一次。为了解决这个问题，你可能希望应用这个修订版的 \"狡猾的现实主义 \"规则。",
	"Using this variant, whenever your characters spend 8 hours resting (or shorter if the character has a feature that allows them to finish the rest in some other way), they finish a short rest. They can only complete a rest once every 24 hours. Every 7th rest the characters take is a long rest.": "使用这个变体，每当你的角色花8小时休息（或者更短，如果角色有允许他们以其他方式完成休息的特征），他们就完成一次短暂的休息。他们每24小时只能完成一次休息。角色每进行第7次休息就是一次长时间休息。",
	"The goal of this is to allow more even combat pacing across multiple days, without requiring characters do nothing for an entire week to achieve a long rest. This also helps the DM to avoid unwanted gaps in narrative development just because characters must complete their long rest. It sucks to build up a sense of urgency and have characters go, \"Well, we can't do anything because we need to sit around for 7 days to long rest.\"": "这样做的目的是为了让战斗节奏在多天内更加均匀，而不要求角色在一整个星期内什么都不做来实现长期休息。这也有助于管理员避免因为角色必须完成长期休息而在叙事发展上出现不必要的空白。建立一种紧迫感，然后让角色说：\"好吧，我们什么都不能做，因为我们需要坐7天来进行长期休息\"，这很糟糕。",

Charging the weapon doesn't expend a spell slot, but if the amplifier is not used on the next round, it discharges harmlessly and must be charged again.": "奥术放大器是一个独特的模块，因为它必须安装在一个中型或大型硬点中，而不是占用货物空间。作为该硬点的替代，该炮允许施法者将攻击性的唤起法术放大到巨型法术的规模。要使用奥术放大器，你必须是一个施法者，而且你必须是炮手桥头组的角色。要使用奥术放大器，你必须先用你的行动为它充电一回合。为武器充电并不消耗一个法术槽，但如果在下一回合没有使用放大器，它就会无害地放电，必须再次充电。",
	"If you use your action to cast an evocation spell into the charged amplifier, you can choose a ship or mega creature instead of a creature as the target for the spell. The spell must have a duration of instantaneous and a range of 5 feet or greater. The DM can decide if a spell is inappropriate to be magnified by the amplifier.": "如果你用你的行动向带电的放大器施放唤起法术，你可以选择一艘船或巨型生物而不是一个生物作为法术的目标。该法术的持续时间必须是瞬时的，范围必须是5英尺或更大。DM可以决定一个法术是否不适合被放大器放大。",
	"The arcane amplifier transforms the spell into a mega spell, and is subject to all the normal limitations of mega spells.

Also the spell deals mega damage instead of normal damage.": "奥术放大器将该法术转化为巨型法术，并受到巨型法术的所有正常限制。它的范围和法术效果的维度都乘以100，最大范围为10,000英尺。同时，该法术会造成巨型伤害而不是普通伤害。",
	"This device is another creation by the Arcane to add value to using their helms over others. When installed, this device is attached to a ship's hull and has a magical connection to the ship's Wildjammer Helm. As a ship sails, it gathers residual magical energy from the aether and phlogiston.": "这个装置是奥术师的另一项创造，目的是为了增加使用他们的舵的价值而不是其他。安装后，这个装置附着在船体上，并与船上的野人头盔有着神奇的联系。当船只航行时，它会从乙太和活塞中收集残留的魔法能量。",

	"Anyone aboard a ship can activate the chameleon orb.

A creature can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to attempt to see through the illusion.": "船上的任何人都可以激活变色龙球。当被激活时，它会产生一个周围景观的幻象，将船隐藏在气泡之外的人的视线中。一个生物可以进行DC20智力（调查）检查，试图看穿这个幻象。",

	"When a creature casts the {@spell Invisibility} spell, they can touch the ship and have the spell amplified to mega scale. Until the spell ends, everything inside of the ship's air bubble is invisible to anyone outside of it. The spell ends early if anyone aboard the ship makes a {@i Ship Weapon Attack}, casts a mega spell, or if the ship moves more than 500 feet in a turn.": "当一个生物施展{@spell Invisibility}法术时，他们可以接触到这艘船，并让法术放大到巨型规模。在咒语结束之前，飞船的气泡内的所有东西对它之外的人都是不可见的。如果船上的人做出（1%）、施放巨型法术，或在一个回合内移动超过500英尺，则咒语会提前结束。",
	"This sectioned off portion on the stern of the ship can be activated by any bridge crew office as an action to release a wall of debris into space behind the ship.

	"These hard-shelled vessels are designed to hone in on the nearest large celestial body and fall into them. Lifeboats are small enough to go undetected by most.

Once they land, lifeboats break down and become inoperable.": "这些硬壳船的设计是为了磨练最近的大天体并落入其中。救生艇很小，足以不被大多数人发现。救生艇可以抵御大部分的伤害，但它们不能处理野战舵手或以干扰的速度行驶。一旦着陆，救生艇就会分解，变得无法使用。",
	"Each lifeboat takes up 1 ton of cargo space and can carry 5 medium creatures to safety.": "每艘救生艇占用1吨的货物空间，可以携带5个中型生物到安全地带。",
	"This device was created by the Arcane to make it easier on for ships to sail through crystal spheres and the flow. By leeching a small amount of magic off of the Helmsman through use on the ship, the passage device builds up a charge that can be used by the Helmsman to create a portal in a crystal sphere, much like casting the {@spell Create Portal|wjmais} without expending a spell slot.": "这个装置是由奥术师创造的，以使船只更容易通过水晶球和水流。通过在船上使用，从舵手身上吸取少量的魔力，这个通道装置可以建立起一个电荷，舵手可以用这个电荷在水晶球中建立一个入口，就像施放{@spell Create Portal|wjmais}一样，而不需要消耗一个法术槽。",

	"This amplification doesn't work unless there is a Helmsman actively attuned to the helm. If this spell is cast on a ship with an unwilling Helmsman, they must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against the spell save DC of the caster to resist the effect.": "除非有一个舵手积极地配合舵手的工作，否则这种放大作用是无效的。如果这个法术被施放在一个有不愿意的舵手的船上，他们必须用魅力值来对抗施法者的法术保全DC，以抵御这个效果。",
