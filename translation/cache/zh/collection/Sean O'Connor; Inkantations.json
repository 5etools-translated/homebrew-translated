	"This book covers both mundane tattoos and body art, as well as magically infused tattoos–some merely decorative, others imbuing the bearer with special abilities the equal of many magical items. From a butterfly tattoo that flutters its wings, to tattoo gills that allow one to breathe underwater, magical tattoos come in many different varieties. In addition to tattoos, other forms of body art can be found in various cultures, from ritual or decorative scarification, to branding, to getting variety of body parts pierced. Not every craftsman who offers one of these will offer all three, and certain forms of body art will be rare no matter where one travels. Tattoos vary widely by culture, by subculture, by race, and by class or occupation. Tattoos can often tell the canny observer quite a bit about the decorated individual, whether it reveals membership in a secret society, indicates having been a prisoner, or even a past bound in slavery. By the same token, different cultures have different associations with tattooing. For example, in some cultures, having a tattoo is the sign of being a criminal, and as such has a negative stigma attached. In another culture, a tattoo marking a rite of passage may be required before one is allowed to live independently or marry and start a family. Tattoos often serve as a symbol of brotherhood, with mercenaries often getting the emblem of their company tattooed on their skin. (Author's note: These are mainly intended to provide guidelines for NPCs and background for PCs)": "本书涵盖了平凡的纹身和人体艺术，以及被注入魔法的纹身--有些只是装饰性的，有些则赋予持有者特殊的能力，与许多魔法物品相当。从扇动翅膀的蝴蝶纹身，到允许人在水下呼吸的鳃部纹身，神奇的纹身有许多不同的种类。除了纹身，其他形式的人体艺术在各种文化中都可以找到，从仪式性或装饰性的伤疤，到烙印，再到在身体各部位穿孔。并非每个提供其中一种的工匠都会提供所有三种，而且无论在哪里旅行，某些形式的人体艺术都很罕见。纹身因文化、亚文化、种族、阶级或职业而有很大不同。纹身通常可以告诉精明的观察者关于被装饰的个人的很多信息，无论是揭示秘密社会的成员身份，还是表明曾经是一名囚犯，甚至是被奴役的过去。同样的道理，不同的文化与纹身有不同的关联。例如，在一些文化中，有纹身就是罪犯的标志，因此有一种负面的污名。在另一种文化中，在一个人被允许独立生活或结婚和组建家庭之前，可能需要一个标志着成年仪式的纹身。纹身经常作为兄弟情谊的象征，雇佣兵经常在皮肤上纹上他们公司的徽章。(作者注：这些主要是为了给NPC提供指南，给NPC提供背景。）",
	"Race is usually not a major factor in whether or not an individual is likely to admire or get tattoos. Those are much more a part of the subculture and social class an individual is a member of. What race does determine is much simpler: whether or not an individual can in fact get tattoos in the first place. In basic terms, any creature of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type, barring those with incorporeal or reptilian subtypes, are eligible for tattooing. Creatures with fast healing or regeneration powers are also ineligible for tattoos–their bodies repair the miniscule damage from the needle too quickly to allow the tattoo to form. In addition, creatures with natural body armor have their natural armor bonus added to the tattoo artist's DC for the tattoo, and creatures with an Immunity to piericng cannot get tattoos unless special tools are used (see the {@item Gnomish Tattoo Machine|INK} in Chapter 1 and {@item Katavahndi's Stylus|INK} in Chapter 3).": "种族通常不是一个人是否可能欣赏或获得纹身的主要因素。这些更多是一个人的亚文化和社会阶层的一部分。种族决定的因素要简单得多：一个人是否可以首先获得纹身。基本上，任何类人或畸形人类型的生物，除了那些无体或爬行动物的亚型外，都有资格进行刺青。具有快速愈合或再生能力的生物也不符合纹身的条件--它们的身体会迅速修复针头造成的微小伤害，从而使纹身形成。此外，拥有天然身体护甲的生物，其天然护甲加成会加到纹身师的纹身DC上，而对穿刺有免疫力的生物不能纹身，除非使用特殊工具（见第一章的（%0%）和第三章的（%1%））。",
	"When you do consider the races, elves infrequently use tattoos as they prefer the unspoiled beauty of natural forms. However, their appreciation of beauty means that when they do adopt the art they usually master it with the same graceful and intricate design work seen in their architecture and clothing, using the tattoo to enhance the beauty of its wearer. Orcs usually use cruder materials under the care of less skilled craftsmen. Their tattoos are often rough, larger, in a few brash colors and have an almost smeared quality to them. Not surprisingly, these tattoos are easier to see at a distance and are more useful on a battlefield. Halflings rarely adopt tattooing in their native cultures, though some who live among humans develop a taste for it. Gnomes use tattoos even less than halflings do, with a few rare crafters' guilds adopting the use to show rank among colleagues. Of the so called ‘short races' dwarves are probably the only race to widely adopt tattoos, though it is far from universal. For example, dwarven miners or soldiers may get ink done after getting drunk (and dying their beards pink). Humans are the most creative and diverse of tattoo enthusiasts, though they are also so varied as to defy generalization.": "当你考虑到这些种族时，精灵们不常使用纹身，因为他们更喜欢自然形式的未受破坏的美。然而，他们对美的欣赏意味着，当他们采用这种艺术时，他们通常会用他们的建筑和服装中看到的同样优雅和复杂的设计工作来掌握它，用纹身来增强佩戴者的美。兽人通常在不太熟练的工匠的照料下使用粗糙的材料。他们的纹身通常是粗糙的，较大的，有一些粗暴的颜色，并且有一种几乎被涂抹的质量。毫不奇怪，这些纹身在远处更容易看到，在战场上也更有用。半身人在他们的本土文化中很少采用纹身，尽管一些生活在人类中的半身人对纹身产生了兴趣。地精比半身人更少使用纹身，只有少数罕见的手工业者行会采用纹身来显示同事之间的等级。在所谓的 \"矮小种族 \"中，矮人可能是唯一广泛采用纹身的种族，尽管这远非普遍现象。例如，矮人矿工或士兵在喝醉后可能会去做墨水（并将他们的胡子染成粉红色）。人类是最具创造性和多样性的纹身爱好者，尽管他们也是如此多样，以至于无法归纳。",
	"Beyond the common races, there are other factors to consider–fur covered humanoids can get tattoos, but are unlikely to want to endure the arduous task of repeated shaving to get and display the inkwork. Beings such as centaurs and lamias can get tattoos on their humanoid parts without having to deal with such things. Fey such as pixies, dryads, and nymphs, are beings of constant change, and while they may use henna and body paints or magic to mimic tattoos for decorative purposes, they will rarely permanently mark themselves. Reptilian creatures such as kobolds, lizardmen, and troglodytes cannot get tattoo work done because of their scaled hide–the ridged scales prohibit the smooth line work necessary for tattooing to be possible.": "除了常见的种族之外，还有其他因素需要考虑--被毛皮覆盖的人形生物可以得到纹身，但不太可能愿意忍受反复剃须以获得和展示墨迹的艰巨任务。半人马和拉米亚人等生物可以在他们的人形部位得到纹身，而不必处理这种事情。小精灵、干尸和仙女等精灵，是不断变化的生命，虽然他们可能使用指甲油和人体颜料或魔法来模仿纹身以达到装饰目的，但他们很少会在自己身上留下永久的标记。爬行动物，如哥布林、蜥蜴人和troglodytes不能进行纹身工作，因为他们有鳞片的皮肤--脊状的鳞片阻止了纹身所需的平滑线条工作的实现。",
	"Undead creatures cannot get tattoos, but they will keep any they had in life. With vampires in particular, the ink will often look much bolder due to the pallor of the flesh and will not fade with time. In the case of magical tattoos, they will remain functional for intelligent, self-aware undead only. Constructs may be sculpted with markings and engravings that look like tattoos, but they cannot get actual ink of any sort done. Shapeshifters who aren't otherwise prohibited may get tattoos, however unless their tattoos are enhanced with the shapechanging aspect (see Chapter 1), they are hopeless distorted in any form other than the one they were tattooed in.": "不死生物不能纹身，但他们会保留他们生前的任何纹身。尤其是吸血鬼，由于肉体的苍白，墨水往往看起来更大胆，而且不会随着时间的推移而褪色。在魔法纹身的情况下，它们只对聪明的、有自我意识的亡灵保持功能。构造物可以被雕刻上看起来像纹身的标记和刻痕，但他们不能得到任何形式的实际墨水。没有被禁止的变形者可以得到纹身，然而除非他们的纹身在变形方面得到加强（见第一章），否则他们在任何其他形式的纹身中都无可救药地被扭曲。",
	"Of special note: elves and other species with large or pointed ears may get tattoos on their ears, but this is only common among some subcultures–it is often a signal of slavery. Multiple piercings are much more common. Ear tattoos, if magical, occupy the head slot (or the optional Ear slot–see Magical Body Jewelry in Chapter 3).": "需要特别注意的是：精灵和其他拥有大耳朵或尖耳朵的物种可能会在耳朵上纹身，但这只在一些亚文化中很常见--这通常是奴隶制的一个信号。多重穿孔则更为常见。耳朵上的纹身，如果有魔力的话，会占据头部的位置（或可选的耳朵位置--见第三章的魔力身体饰品）。",
	"In general, wilderness cultures tend to feature extensive tattooing, especially to indicate strength, prowess, or the gift of magic. Tribal warriors will bear extensive tattoos as a testament to their pain tolerance, made all the more impressive when one considers the method used to create the tattoos–tools such as sharpened bone needles and a small hammer are common. Nonwarriors may have tattoos to indicate passage into adulthood, marital status, as cosmetics, and in slaveowning cultures, to indicate who owns them. Clans within the tribe may also have their own markings to show their heritage. Shamans will usually have numerous tattoos to correspond to their experience and their level of power or prestige. In fact, almost all important occasions in some tribes are marked in such a way, leading to all members of the tribe except children being tattooed extensively.": "一般来说，荒野文化往往以广泛的纹身为特征，特别是为了表示力量、能力或魔法的天赋。部落战士会有大量的纹身，以证明他们对疼痛的耐受力，如果考虑到创造纹身的方法，就更令人印象深刻了--磨尖的骨针和小锤子等工具很常见。非战士可能有纹身，以表示进入成人期，婚姻状况，作为化妆品，以及在奴隶制文化中，表示谁拥有他们。部落内的部族也可能有自己的标记，以显示他们的遗产。巫师们通常会有许多纹身，以对应他们的经验和他们的权力或威望水平。事实上，在一些部落中，几乎所有的重要场合都会有这样的标记，导致部落中除儿童外的所有成员都会有大量的纹身。",
	"Wilderness cultures characteristically have rather abstract, stylized tattoos that are deeply reminiscent of the pictographs many tribes use to record tribal history and legends. Such tattoos may appear crude, but in truth tribal tattoos do not attempt for realistic representations. Instead, they attempt to capture the ‘spirit' of what they depict in an abstract manner. For example, a tattoo that, to the civilized eye, might look like a cluster of jagged lines with a serpentine track between them, may represent the mountain stream where the tribe successfully fought off a lethal invader. Lines and circles depicting natural cycles are also common motifs. Of particular note are tattoos mimicking tribal war paint–warriors who are inked with permanent war paint are often berserkers, lethal in combat and troublesome in peace, who even members of the same tribe will give a wide berth. Such tattoos are both an honorific and a warning. Tribal tattoos are also a means of identification and unity. Outsiders wearing tattoos that look like tribal tattoos will instantly be viewed with suspicion and unless they can convince a tribal member they earned the tattoo in a fitting manner (successful Persuasion or Deception check with -5 circumstance penalty), are likely to be attacked and if they're lucky, only have the offending tattoo forcibly removed (see Tattoo Removal in Chapter 1).": "荒野文化的特点是有相当抽象的、风格化的纹身，让人深深联想到许多部落用来记录部落历史和传说的象形文字。这种纹身可能看起来很粗糙，但事实上，部落纹身并不试图进行现实的表述。相反，他们试图以一种抽象的方式捕捉他们所描绘的 \"精神\"。例如，在文明人的眼中，一个纹身可能看起来像一簇锯齿状的线条，在它们之间有一条蛇形的轨迹，但它可能代表部落成功击退致命入侵者的山涧。描绘自然周期的线条和圆圈也是常见的图案。特别值得注意的是模仿部落战争颜料的纹身--涂有永久战争颜料的战士往往是狂暴者，在战斗中是致命的，在和平时期是麻烦的，即使是同一个部落的成员也会对他们敬而远之。这样的纹身既是一种尊称，也是一种警告。部落纹身也是一种识别和团结的手段。除非他们能以合适的方式让部落成员相信他们获得了这个纹身（劝说或欺骗检查成功，环境惩罚为-5），否则很可能会被攻击，如果他们幸运的话，只会被强行移除违规的纹身（见第一章的纹身移除）。",
	"Nomadic and seafaring cultures often use tattoos as a means of self-decoration that doesn't take up precious space or add unnecessary weight during one's travels. Tattoos among such cultures are generally highly individual, as opposed to the community-based tattoos found among tribal peoples. The tattoos are less abstract in their representations and are usually easily deciphered. Sailors are likely to have images of ships, exotic natives, of battles against sea creatures, and of strange ports tattooed on themselves. Nomadic herders and traders tend to commemorate family, prized livestock, or whatever suits their fancy. Traders will collect tattoos from a variety of lands they travel through, while herders will usually avoid the needlework of other cultures, maintaining a sense of \"home\" no matter where they go. Both of these cultures frequently have scripted tattoos as well as representative tattoos, with sayings, names, or mottoes all being popular forms of ink among nomadic and seafaring peoples.": "游牧文化和航海文化经常使用纹身作为一种自我装饰的手段，在旅行中不占用宝贵的空间或增加不必要的重量。这类文化中的纹身通常是高度个人化的，与部落民族中以社区为基础的纹身不同。纹身的表现形式不那么抽象，通常很容易被破译。水手们很可能在自己身上纹上船只、异国土人、与海洋生物的战斗以及陌生港口的图像。游牧民和商人倾向于纪念家庭、珍贵的牲畜，或任何适合他们的东西。商人会从他们旅行过的各种土地上收集纹身，而牧民通常会避免其他文化的针线活，无论他们去哪里，都会保持一种 \"家 \"的感觉。这两种文化都经常有文字刺青和代表刺青，谚语、名字或格言都是游牧民族和航海民族中流行的墨水形式。",
	"Agrarian cultures are generally sparing of tattoos–subsistence farmers can't afford the luxury of self-adornment that inking represents, and larger, wealthier farmers don't find much appeal in it. Priests of agricultural deities may occasionally be marked with the symbol of their gods, but otherwise there is little interest or call for tattooing among farming cultures. A major reason for this is because they stay in one place to develop the land and raise crops, thus reducing their exposure to other cultures and eliminating the need to carry a \"piece of home\" with oneself. In addition, because farming is labor intensive, it's impractical to have a farm worker unable to work for a few days over getting a tattoo done.": "农耕文化通常对纹身不屑一顾--自给自足的农民负担不起墨水所代表的自我装饰的奢侈，而更大、更富有的农民也不觉得它有什么吸引力。农业神的祭司可能偶尔会被打上他们的神的符号，但除此之外，农业文化中对纹身的兴趣和呼声都不高。一个主要原因是他们呆在一个地方开发土地和种植庄稼，因此减少了与其他文化的接触，不需要随身携带 \"家的一部分\"。此外，由于农业是劳动密集型产业，让一个农场工人因为做纹身而无法工作几天是不现实的。",
	"It is among urban cultures where the art of tattoos becomes the most diverse and idiosyncratic. The density of population allows for a degree of anonymity, and the relative affluence of cities mean that tattoo artists can find enough customers to support their art. While tattoos in urban culture have less immediate meaning across the culture, they can be very meaningful to the individual and are often indicative of one's subculture. Trade cities are also likely to have a variety of artists, styles, and methods to choose from, while more isolated cities might only have one method, but it is developed to a very high degree.": "正是在城市文化中，纹身艺术变得最多样化和特异化。人口密度允许一定程度的匿名性，而城市的相对富裕意味着纹身艺术家可以找到足够的客户来支持他们的艺术。虽然城市文化中的纹身在整个文化中的直接意义较小，但它们对个人来说可能非常有意义，而且往往表明一个人的亚文化。贸易城市也可能有各种艺术家、风格和方法可供选择，而更偏僻的城市可能只有一种方法，但它已经发展到非常高的程度。",
	"One's subculture is truly the determining factor for most tattoos. Gangs, mercenary companies, military units, clans, tribes, and guilds are all likely to have tattoos which serve as a badge of membership. Sailors in the same crew will often bear either the ensign or the name of the ship, witches in the same coven may have the same mark imbued on their skin. Essentially any group which places value and pride on membership is likely to have a tattoo common to its members. Adventurers who have been traveling together a long time and shared many escapades may memorialize this with tattoos as well.": "一个人的亚文化确实是大多数纹身的决定因素。帮派、雇佣兵公司、军事单位、宗族、部落和行会都可能有作为成员徽章的纹身。同一船队的水手往往会有军旗或船名，同一女巫会的女巫可能在皮肤上有相同的标记。基本上，任何以成员身份为价值和骄傲的团体都可能有其成员共同的纹身。一起旅行了很长时间并分享了许多冒险经历的冒险者，也可能用纹身来纪念这一点。",
	"In societies with very rigid social classes, or even hereditary castes, tattoos marking one's station may be found. Slaves in particular will be tattooed or branded as a method of marking them as chattel, and distinguishing which slaves belong to which owner. Peasants or indentured servants might bear similar marks to show who they serve or work for.": "在有非常严格的社会等级，甚至是世袭种姓的社会中，可能会发现标志个人地位的纹身。特别是奴隶会被纹上或打上烙印，作为标记他们是动产的一种方法，并区分哪些奴隶属于哪个主人。农民或契约仆人可能会有类似的标记，以显示他们为谁服务或工作。",
	"Some communities take the opposite approach, with commoners and slaves bearing no tattoos or brands, and the higher-ranking members of society being decorated instead. Nobles and merchants may receive tattoos as they move up in rank on the local social ladder, or in politics or business. In areas with high rates of illiteracy, business-owners may find that a tattoo marking them as a butcher brings them more customers than hanging a sign above their door.": "有些社区采取相反的做法，平民和奴隶没有纹身或烙印，而社会中地位较高的成员则被装饰起来。贵族和商人在当地的社会阶梯上，或在政治或商业上的地位上升时，可能会接受纹身。在文盲率高的地区，企业主可能会发现，标明他们是屠夫的纹身比在门上挂个牌子能带来更多的顾客。",
	"Tattooing and other body arts require specific skills and equipment not normally possessed by the general population. They also have unique terminology, especially when it comes to magical tattoos. Before one can become a tattooist or other body artist, much less an inkantationist, one must learn extensively about the craft.": "纹身和其他身体艺术需要特定的技能和设备，一般人都不具备。它们也有独特的术语，尤其是涉及到魔法纹身时。在成为一名纹身师或其他身体艺术家之前，更不用说成为一名喷墨师了，必须广泛地学习这门技艺。",
	"While common skills such as {@item Painter's Supplies}, {@item Calligrapher's Supplies}, {@skill Arcane}, even {item Alchemist's Supplies} and {@skil Medicine} are all important in the processes of applying tattoos and other body art, there are is new skills specific to the field, Tattoo/Body Artist Supplies. With some specific applications:": "虽然{@item Painter's Supplies}、{@item Calligrapher's Supplies}、{@skill Arcane}、甚至{item Alchemist's Supplies}和{@skil Medicine}等常见技能在应用纹身和其他人体艺术的过程中都很重要，但还有一些新技能是该领域特有的，即纹身/身体艺术家用品。有了一些具体的应用。",

	"{@b Enhanced Tattoos}: Animated, Luminous, Shapechanging, Long-lasting: Tattoos beyond the norm, enhanced tattoos are touched with magic to give them a variety of extraordinary effects. Animated tattoos add motion to their images: animals caper, dancers flow, trees rustle with the breeze, and so on. Luminous tattoos produce their own light, glowing in the color of their ink. The light is not bright–a Medium luminous tattoo produces about as much illumination as a candle. However, it does make the tattoo readily visible and memorable. The light produces no heat and can be extinguished at will with a command word. Shapechanging tattoos do not move like animated tattoos, rather they shift between one form and another, normally. However, when on a creature with the shapechanger subtype, they will retain their form even as the bearer changes. Normally a tattoo would be hopelessly distorted by the shapeshift. Long-lasting tattoos are just as they sound, remaining vibrant for twice as long as usual. Regular tattoos, even with perfect care, need to be touched up due to fading, every 5 + 1d6 years. Long-lasting tattoos look fresh for 10 + 2d6 years. An abstract tattoo.

Tattoo base cost is reduced by half for each size step down (though the DC goes up 1 per size level below Medium), so a Tiny tattoo would be 25 sp per DC of the tattoo. Conversely, the cost is doubled for each size level above Medium, so a Huge tattoo (big enough to cover the entire back of a typical human) would be 40 gp per DC. Tables 1-2 and 1-3 describe the costs and sizes of tattoos in more detail. Enhanced and wondrous tattoos have additional costs due to the magic involved.": "制作纹身墨水也使用工艺（纹身/身体艺术家用品）技能，除非涉及到不寻常的或神奇的原料，在这种情况下，使用工艺（炼金术士用品）。世俗的纹身根据大小和复杂程度的不同而费用不同。一个中等大小的纹身每DC为10戈比，约为6英寸乘6英寸。纹身的基本费用每降低一个尺寸就会减少一半（不过低于中号的尺寸，DC会增加1），所以一个小号的纹身每DC是25sp。反之，超过中等尺寸的每一级，成本都会翻倍，所以一个巨大的纹身（大到足以覆盖一个普通人的整个背部）将是每DC40戈比。表1-2和表1-3更详细地描述了纹身的成本和大小。增强型和奇妙型的纹身由于涉及到魔法而有额外的费用。",

The tattoo artist can work a number of consecutive hours equal to their Constitution score. The character receiving the tattoo takes nonlethal damage equal to half the Craft DC of the tattoo, and can endure a number of hours of getting work done equal to their Constitution score. The character must make a Constitution save to endure the process, with a failed save meaning the character does not hold still and the tattoo is not applied, wasting that day's time.": "接下来是纹身的应用，即实际的针墨工作。这是一个工艺（纹身/身体艺术家用品）卷，根据纹身师所使用的工具进行修改，每个DC的纹身的基本时间为1小时，超过中等尺寸的每级修改1小时，低于中等尺寸的每级减半。纹身师可以连续工作的小时数等于他们的体质得分。接受纹身的角色受到的非致命伤害等于纹身的工艺DC的一半，并且可以忍受的工作时间与他们的体质分数相等。角色必须进行宪法救赎才能忍受这个过程，救赎失败意味着角色不能保持静止，纹身也不会被应用，浪费了当天的时间。",
	"Finally, upon completing the tattoo the artist must make a Medicine check, DC equal to ½ the DC of the tattoo, modified by the tools and facilities available to the artist, to make sure it heals correctly.

Applying henna or silver henna requires a DC 10 Craft (henna) check, +5 for especially large or complex patterns.": "{@b Henna}: 亨纳是一种由指甲花植物制成的天然染料，可将皮肤染成红褐色至深褐色，而银色亨纳是一种最初由乌鸦开发的草药混合物，会留下明亮的银色污点。无论哪种类型的指甲花，其使用方法都是一样的，即制作精心设计的临时纹身。这些设计通常具有文化或宗教意义，但有时只是为了增强接受指甲花的人的美感。涂抹指甲花或银色指甲花需要进行DC 10工艺（指甲花）检查，对于特别大或复杂的图案，需要+5。",
	"{@b Piercings}: Adorning one's body isn't limited to rings, amulets, and other traditional forms of jewelry. Body jewelry includes nose rings, labrets, tongue piercings (usually bar or stud shaped), eyebrow rings, navel rings, and even such exotica as nipple piercings and piercings of the private areas and arrangements like the \"corset piercing\". Sometimes piercings are connected by fine chains as well. In some cultures these decorations are worn only on special occasions, such as one's wedding day, with far plainer jewelry worn day to day. In other subcultures, body piercings may be openly displayed at all times, often as a symbol of rebellion or rejection of traditional looks. Performing a piercing requires a Craft (piercing) check, DC 5 +10 for more sensitive areas. The recipient takes 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. Failing the roll by more than 5 does the same amount of lethal damage, with 1 point of bleed for 1d3 rounds, or until healed.": "{@b Piercings}: 装饰自己的身体并不局限于戒指、护身符和其他传统形式的珠宝。身体首饰包括鼻环、唇环、舌环（通常是条形或螺柱形）、眉环、脐环，甚至包括乳头穿孔和私密部位的穿孔以及像 \"胸衣穿孔 \"这样的安排。有时，穿孔也是由细链连接的。在一些文化中，这些装饰品只在特殊场合佩戴，比如一个人的婚礼当天，而日常佩戴的首饰则朴素得多。在其他亚文化中，身体上的穿孔可能在任何时候都公开展示，通常作为叛逆或拒绝传统外观的象征。进行穿孔需要进行工艺（穿孔）检查，对于更敏感的部位，DC5+10。接受者会受到1d2点非致命伤害。如果失败超过5次，则造成相同数量的致命伤害，并在1d3回合内有1点出血，或直到痊愈。",

	"{@b Scarification}: Any adventurer worth their title is going to pick up a scar or two. Some are disfiguring, others grant a certain roguish charm. None of these are actual scarification, however. Scarification is the process of being intentionally scarred for decoration. Some cultures, especially among races that cannot be tattooed, use it instead of tattooing; others have religious significance associated with the act. Whatever the purpose, the process is generally the same. Sharp tools, not unlike leatherworking tools, are used to carve a pattern into living flesh, which is then either cauterized or otherwise treated to form clean scars. Performing scarification requires a Craft (scarification) check, DC 10 +5 for complex patterns. Scarification does 1d6 points of non-lethal damage and 1d3 lethal damage. Failing the roll by more than 5 does the total amount in lethal damage, with 1 point of Bleed damage for 1d6 rounds, or until healed. Failing by more than 10 gives the recipient a permanent disfiguring (non-artistic) scar, resulting in -1 Charisma drain.": "{@b Scarification}: 任何有价值的冒险者都会有一两个伤疤。有些是毁容的，有些则赋予某种无赖的魅力。然而，这些都不是真正的伤疤。疤痕化是指为了装饰而故意留下疤痕的过程。一些文化，特别是在不能纹身的种族中，用它来代替纹身；另一些文化则将宗教意义与这种行为联系起来。不管是什么目的，其过程一般都是一样的。锋利的工具，与皮革加工工具不一样，被用来在活人的肉体上雕刻图案，然后对其进行烧灼或其他处理，形成干净的疤痕。进行伤痕处理需要进行工艺（伤痕处理）检查，对于复杂的图案，DC10+5。疤痕化会造成1d6点非致命性伤害和1d3致命性伤害。如果失败超过5次，则造成总的致命伤害，并在1d6回合内造成1点出血伤害，或直到痊愈。失败超过10次会给受术者带来永久性的毁容（非艺术性）疤痕，导致-1的魅力消耗。",
	"At its most basic, the art of tattooing needs only a sharpened implement and ink. While needles are the most standard equipment, in some cases it may be as simple as a sharpened bit of bone or a writing quill used to pierce the skin. Or sharp bone chisels may used, leaving the skin grooved instead of smooth. Pigment varies from ink with iron filaments in it, to burnt timbers mixed with fat, to alchemical concoctions which produce luminous ink or other magical effects. Even cruder methods are used in prisons, with improvised tools and ink. The other body arts also require specific supplies, though without quite as much variety as exists for tattoo equipment. The items listed in Table 1-4 are described below.": "在最基本的情况下，纹身艺术只需要一个削尖的工具和墨水。虽然针是最标准的设备，但在某些情况下，它可能只是简单地用削尖的骨头或写字用的羽毛笔来刺破皮肤。或者使用锋利的骨凿，使皮肤出现凹槽而不是光滑。颜料的种类繁多，从含有铁丝的墨水，到与脂肪混合的烧焦的木材，再到产生发光墨水或其他神奇效果的炼金术混合物。监狱里使用的方法甚至更粗糙，使用的是简易的工具和墨水。其他身体艺术也需要特定的用品，尽管没有像纹身设备那样多的种类。表1-4中列出的物品描述如下。",

	"{@b Flash}: Pre-existing sample illustrations of tattoo art, flash is displayed on the walls of a tattoo parlor to give customers an idea of the artist's abilities. Using a piece of flash art negates the designing phase and, because it's a design well practiced by the artist, reduces the tattoo application DC by 5. Simple, basic flash can cost the artist as little as 5 sp in supplies to produce, while large detailed designs can cost as much as 50 gp.": "{@b Flash}: 预先存在的纹身艺术的样本插图，闪光显示在纹身店的墙上，让顾客了解艺术家的能力。使用闪光艺术可以省去设计阶段，而且因为它是艺术家练习过的设计，所以可以减少5的纹身应用DC。简单的、基本的闪光可以让艺术家只花费5sp的材料来制作，而大型的详细设计可以花费50gp。",
	"{@b Henna}: Henna is a natural dye used to cover the hands, feet and other body parts with tattoo-like designs that fade after a number of days (usually 3 + 3d6 days).

One package of henna powder (which is mixed with water to use) is enough to cover the hands and feet of two Medium-sized creatures once.": "{@b Henna}: Henna是一种天然染料，用于覆盖手、脚和其他身体部位的类似纹身的图案，在若干天后（通常是3+3d6天）会褪色。只要指甲油还在，穿戴者就能在欺骗和劝导检查中获得+1的奖励。一包指甲花粉（使用时与水混合）足以覆盖两个中型生物的手和脚一次。",
	"{@b Henna, Silver}: Silver henna is not true henna, but is a unique pigment with similar properties. It is common primarily among the drow, orcs and other darker-skinned races, but is gaining popularity with others. This unique herbal concoction allows intricate tattoo-like designs to show up on dark skin where regular ink or henna would be less visible. Like normal henna, silver henna begins to fade after a few days (usually 3 + 3d6 days). Also like normal henna, silver henna grants a +1 bonus to Deception and Persuasion checks for as long as the henna persists. A package of silver henna powder (which is mixed with water to use)is enough to cover the hands and feet of two Medium-sized creature once.": "{@b Henna, Silver}: 银色指甲油不是真正的指甲油，但却是一种具有类似特性的独特颜料。它主要在乌鸦、兽人和其他皮肤较黑的种族中很常见，但在其他人中也越来越受欢迎。这种独特的草药混合物可以让复杂的纹身式设计在深色皮肤上显现出来，而普通墨水或指甲油则不太明显。与普通指甲油一样，银色指甲油在几天后开始褪色（通常是3+3d6天）。也和普通指甲油一样，银色指甲油在持续存在的时间内，会给欺骗和劝说检查带来+1的奖励。一包银色指甲油粉末（使用时与水混合）足以覆盖两个中型生物的手和脚一次。",
	"{@b Piercing Kit}: A piercing kit contains a wide array of needles, clamps, pads, gauze, alcohol, and other implements used to pierce the skin. The cost of a piercing kit does not include jewelry.

	"{@b Tattoo Machine, Gnomish}: A gnomish-designed contraption that speeds up the tattoo process by rapidly punching the needle into the skin and injecting the ink several times per second. With practice, this makes doing complex tattoos much faster and easier for most artists. Using a tattoo machine effectively requires 4 or more ranks in Craft (Tattoo/Body Artist Supplies). A tattoo machine reduces the DC of the tattoo by 5 and reduces the time by half. Appropriate needles–bone, gold or steel–must be purchased separately. These machines are made from brass and steel with rubber tubes and steel chains. They have adjustable controls for speed while depth of the needle is controlled by the operator. A foot pump provides the pneumatic pressure. Because of the expense of the equipment there is a lucrative market in second hand tattooing machines. Due to the rapid and powerful punching motion of a gnomish tattoo machine, a tattoo artist can overcome damage reduction, and apply ink to creatures whose skin cannot be penetrated by normal tattooing methods.": "{@b Tattoo Machine, Gnomish}: 一个地精设计的装置，通过快速将针头打入皮肤并在每秒内注入墨水来加快纹身过程。通过练习，这使得大多数艺术家在做复杂的纹身时更加快速和容易。有效使用纹身机需要4级或以上的工艺（纹身/身体艺术家用品）。纹身机可以使纹身的DC减少5，时间减少一半。适当的针头--骨针、金针或钢针--必须单独购买。这些机器由黄铜和钢制成，带有橡胶管和钢链。它们有可调节的速度控制，而针的深度则由操作员控制。一个脚踏泵提供了气动压力。由于设备的费用，二手纹身机有一个有利可图的市场。由于地精纹身机的快速而有力的打孔运动，纹身师可以克服损伤的减少，并将墨水应用于普通纹身方法无法穿透的生物。",
	"{@b Tattoo Toolkit, Bone}: Consists of various size needles or chisels, bamboo needle holders, and a mallet for tapping the design into the flesh. Use these tools adds +5 to the Constitution save of the recipient–tattoos done in this manner are quite painful to receive. As such, they are often used in rites of passage among warlike cultures. Orcs in particular consider enduring such tattoos to be a sign of adulthood. Replacement needles and holders need to be purchased after every 20 uses.": "{@b Tattoo Toolkit, Bone}: 由各种尺寸的针或凿子、竹制针架和一个用于将图案敲入肉体的木槌组成。使用这些工具可以使受术者的体质恢复能力增加5％--以这种方式完成的纹身在接受时是相当痛苦的。因此，在好战的文化中，它们经常被用于通过仪式。特别是兽人认为忍受这种纹身是成年的标志。每使用20次就需要购买替换的针头和支架。",
	"{@b Tattoo Toolkit, Gold}: Similar to the steel tattoo kit, but with gold needles, which are easier to keep sterile than steel. Due to the reduced risk of infection, gold needles are the tool of choice for tattoo artists who have the means, and they offer a -5 to the MedicineDC.

	"{@b Tattoo Toolkit, Steel}: The standard variety of equipment among tattoo artists, this is an array of steel needles hollowed out to inject the ink. Often this is part of a mechanical device; however there are some types that are hand-operated, much like acupuncture needles. Steel tools are cheap and effective, but cannot be re-used. They have no benefits or penalties to tattoo work. The kit also includes a variety of sizes of bamboo needle holders. Replacement needles and holders need to be purchased after every 20 uses.": "{@b Tattoo Toolkit, Steel}: 纹身师中的标准设备品种，这是一个由钢针掏出的阵列，用于注射墨水。通常这是机械装置的一部分；但也有一些类型是手工操作的，很像针灸针。钢制工具既便宜又有效，但不能重复使用。它们对纹身工作没有任何好处或惩罚。该工具包还包括各种尺寸的竹制针架。每使用20次后需要购买替换针和针架。",

Enhanced tattoos are tattoos that have very minor magic placed on them permanently, allowing a tattoo of a bird to seem to flap its wings, or a dancing girl to spin and twirl.

	"Most spell tattoos use symbolic imagery to reflect the spell contained within–a helm for a mage armor tattoo, an ornate doorway to represent dimension door, the word \"heal\" to mark a cure light wounds tattoo–though some prefer their spell tattoos to be of an abstract nature so it is not obvious to the casual oberserver that they are covered in spells.": "大多数法术纹身使用象征性的意象来反映其中包含的法术--法师盔甲纹身的头盔，代表维度门的华丽门口，标记治愈轻伤纹身的 \"治愈 \"一词--尽管有些人喜欢他们的法术纹身具有抽象的性质，这样对于偶然的观察者来说，他们身上的法术并不明显。",
	"Spell tattoos are activated with a word or by touching the tattoo (this is set by the artist at the time of creation), and when the tattoo is activated, the spell contained within is released. The spell can be activated only by the bearer of the tattoo. Until activated, a spell tattoo will radiate magic of the school the spell belongs to; after activation, no magical aura remains. Within a week the ink fades and the space retains only a faint tracery. Future tattoos of the SAME tattoo however are at a 25% reduction in cost/time": "咒语刺青是用一句话或通过触摸刺青来激活的（这是由艺术家在创作时设定的），当刺青被激活时，其中包含的咒语会被释放。咒语只能由持有纹身的人激活。在激活之前，法术纹身会散发出该法术所属流派的魔力；激活之后，没有魔力光环留下。在一周内，墨水会褪去，空间只保留了一个微弱的痕迹。然而，未来同一纹身的费用/时间会减少25%。",

	"The Bravos of House Arimaa are given the all-mask at their culmination ceremony (few initiates survive to receive this honor, however). The all-mask is an elaborate tattoo covering the entire head, face, neck, and ears, with an abstract pattern unique to its owner–no two are exactly alike. The all-mask, when activated, changes the character's facial appearance to that of another face, real or imagined. Once activated, the tattoo's duration is ½ hour per character level, and may be used a number of times per day equal to their Charisma modifier. The all-mask does not change the bearer's voice or the height, weight or body type, altering only the face, eyes, ears, and hair. When used to impersonate an actual person, the tattooed character can make a DC 15 Wisdom Save, adding his ranks in Disguise to the save. For every point they beat the check by, the duration of the tattoo is increased by one hour, up to 24 hours maximum. This only applies when impersonating an actual person, not when changing features to a fictional person. If the duration is increased to 20 or more hours, it may not be activated again for a full 24 hours. The secrets of the all-mask have been stolen from House Arimaa so it is possible to get the tattoo elsewhere, however seeking the tattoo risks incurring the wrath of agents of the house.

	"These geometric tattoos traditionally cover a single finger of the right hand with such tight sigils and designs that from just a few feet away it looks sickened or diseased. The deep reddish purple ink often spills onto the rest of the hand, and onto the arm, in different swirls depending upon which type of tattoo it is. Originally created long ago by the Amaranthine order of wizards, the knowledge and ability to create the tattoo has since spread much more widely. A single finger sleeve doubles the number of spells an arcane caster can cast each day; with the spell level doubled the same as the sleeve level (similar to a ring of wizardry). Because of the nature of the tattoos, a wizard must have the lesser version before getting the next step tattooed (for instance, a wizard cannot simply have a sleeve III, she must also have a sleeve I and II). Thus, if a wizard wishes to receive a sleeve III tattoo, the costs (and benefits) of sleeves I and II are added to the cost of the sleeve III (130,000 gp total). As each sleeve is added, it takes up another tattoo slot, so a sleeve V takes up a ring slot, hand slot, wrist slot, shoulder slot and back slot, and the tattoo covers all five fingers, the hand, the entire arm, the top and back of the shoulder and upper back, and the lower back. The wizard with such a tattoo has the number of spells of 1st through 5th levels he can cast each day doubled. Since the decline of the Amaranthine Order in recent decades, no one has seen a wizard with a sleeve V, though there are rumors of powerful liches or vampire wizards with such tattoos.": "这些几何图案的纹身传统上覆盖在右手的一个手指上，上面有严密的符号和设计，从几英尺远的地方看，它看起来是病态的或有病的。深红的紫色墨水经常溢出到手的其他部分，以及手臂上，根据不同的纹身类型，形成不同的漩涡。纹身最初是很久以前由阿玛兰丁巫师团创造的，后来创造纹身的知识和能力传播得更广。一个指套可以使奥术施法者每天施放的法术数量翻倍；法术等级翻倍，与指套等级相同（类似于巫师戒指）。由于纹身的性质，一个巫师在得到下一步的纹身之前必须拥有较低的版本（例如，一个巫师不能简单地拥有一个袖子III，她还必须拥有一个袖子I和II）。因此，如果一个巫师希望得到一个袖子III的纹身，那么袖子I和II的费用（和好处）会加到袖子III的费用上（共130,000GP）。随着每一个袖子的增加，它又占用了一个纹身槽，所以一个五号袖子占用了一个戒指槽、手槽、手腕槽、肩膀槽和背部槽，纹身覆盖了所有五个手指、手、整个手臂、肩膀和上背部的顶部和背面以及下背部。拥有这种纹身的巫师，每天可以施展的1至5级法术数量翻倍。自从近几十年来亚马逊教团衰落以来，没有人见过有V型袖子的巫师，尽管有传言说强大的地衣或吸血鬼巫师有这种纹身。",

Also, if the bearer of the tattoos attempts to hide, the activator can always find them.": "奥术束缚是一种阴险的惩罚性纹身，由每个手腕上的一系列奥术符文组成。一旦完成并激活，纹身者将受到激活纹身者的控制。除非纹身以某种方式被移除或失效，否则纹身者不能离开激活者超过1000英尺--试图这样做会导致纹身者冻结在原地，就像咒语中的hold person一样，直到激活者在精神上希望他们获得自由。同样地，激活者可以在任何时候激活对纹身持有者的固定效果。另外，如果纹身的持有者试图隐藏，激活者总能找到他们。",

When two people are the very best of friends, and stand side by side in all that they do, they want a way to keep track of each other and help each other out when they need assistance. Inkantationist sisters Mindra and Mindera Goldleaf created the bonds of friendship tattoos so they could do just that for each other. Bonds of friendship are matching tattoos that two people receive in the same location on their bodies. Many friends choose matching ring tattoos, but any abstract or symbolic tattoo will work, so long as they are exactly the same and in the same spot.

Additionally, when both tattoo bearers are fighting in the same battle (within 100 feet of each other), they each receive a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

	"This wondrous tattoo is a tattoo of a coin in the palm of the hand, which, when activated, allows the character to conjure a single gold coin. It is a real coin, and may be used as such, but it only remains in existence for 24 hours. Whatever coin image is tattooed in the palm is the type of coin that is conjured, so all conjured coins look exactly alike. The tattooed character can conjure one coin per round. If multiple coins are spent in the same place, a DC 20 Perception check allows the person receiving the coins to notice something odd about them (that they are all identical). The name of the tattoo comes not from the creator of the tattoo–as most named wondrous tattoos do–but rather from the name of the most unfortunate person to ever bear the tattoo. Cantrell Ovin was a wainwright in a tiny village who once repaired the wagon of the traveling inkantationist Rezol Ungmir. As payment, Rezol gave Cantrell the coin tattoo, but the only gold coin he had as a likeness was one from a far away empire. Rezol warned Cantrell to use the power of the tattoo sparingly and discretly. Unfortunately, Cantrell did not heed the warning and used the coins everywhere, in grand fashion. It didn't take long for the locals to notice that only Cantrell spent the foreign coins, which always disappeared within 24 hours. Less than a month after receiving the tattoo, Cantrell Ovin was hanged as a thief. His name stuck to the wondrous tattoo afterward as a warning for others to heed Rezol Ungmir's warning of discretion.": "这个奇妙的纹身是在手掌中的一个硬币的纹身，当它被激活时，可以让人物变出一枚金币。它是一个真正的硬币，可以这样使用，但它只保持24小时的存在。纹在手掌上的金币形象就是所变出的金币类型，所以所有变出的金币看起来都一模一样。纹身的人物每回合可以变出一个硬币。如果多个硬币被花在同一个地方，通过DC20的感知检查可以让接受硬币的人注意到它们的奇怪之处（它们都是一样的）。纹身的名字不是来自于纹身的创造者--就像大多数被命名的奇妙纹身一样--而是来自于曾经拥有该纹身的最不幸的人的名字。坎特雷尔-奥文是一个小村庄的锻工，他曾经修理过旅行中的喷墨者雷佐尔-昂米尔的马车。作为报酬，Rezol给了Cantrell金币纹身，但他唯一的金币是来自一个遥远的帝国的像。雷索尔警告坎特雷尔要谨慎地使用纹身的力量。不幸的是，坎特雷尔没有听从警告，到处使用金币，大行其道。没过多久，当地人就注意到，只有坎特雷尔花了这些外国硬币，而这些硬币总是在24小时内消失。收到纹身后不到一个月，坎特雷尔-奥文就被当作小偷吊死了。他的名字后来一直停留在这个奇妙的纹身上，作为对其他人的警告，让他们听从雷佐尔-昂米尔的警告，谨慎行事。",

As with the contingency spell, the spell stored within the tattoo must be 6th level or lower and must be a spell that affects the person bearing the tattoo only.

The coward's brand is effectively a permanent bestow curse, effective whenever the character acts in fear. The effect of the brand is usually sharp and intense pain in the legs and feet resulting in a -6 penalty to Dexterity and movement reduced to 10 feet. Note that cowardice in this context does not apply to those who are affected by a magical fear effect or aura–the magic within the brand can differentiate between innate cowardice and magical fear. A coward so branded can redeem himself by performing a great act of heroism and bravery.

	"A criminal's brand is a magical tattoo or brand that marks a criminal. The mark is in the form of a letter representing the crime–\"R\" for rape, \"T\" for theft, \"M\" for murder, etc. In most societies, the criminal's brand is reserved for repeat offenders or for especially heinous crimes and usually takes the place of imprisonment. The effects of a criminal's brand are varied, depending on the crime. For minor crimes, such as theft under 1,000 gp, disturbing the peace, vandalism, etc., the effect is a -3 penalty to Charisma and a -5 penalty to a skill related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was theft, the penalty would apply to Sleight of Hand or Stealth). GMs should apply the skill penalty as they see fit, but to only a single skill. For major crimes, such as assault, murder, theft over 1,000 gp, or rape, the effect is a -5 penalty to Charisma and a -10 penalty to a skill or ability related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was rape, the penalty could apply to Intimidate or to attack). GMs should apply the penalty as they see fit, but to only one skill or ability. The criminal's brand can be set to fade after a certain length of time (the sentence for the crime, usually a few weeks to a couple of years) or to be permanent (usually the case for the most heinous of crimes). An unexpected benefit to criminals who bear the mark is that in some criminal circles, the Charisma penalty suffered by the tattoo bearer is not only negated, but a bonus equal to half the value of the penalty is actually received (round down). For instance, a thief who receives the criminal's brand for stealing a 750 gp gem might find that among some of his fellow thieves his -3 penalty to Charisma becomes a +1 bonus. This is a GM's decision, however, for some members of the branded thief's guild (especially his superiors) might be irritated he was caught and punished.": "罪犯的烙印是一种标记罪犯的神奇纹身或烙印。烙印的形式是代表犯罪的字母--\"R \"代表强奸，\"T \"代表偷窃，\"M \"代表谋杀，等等。在大多数社会中，罪犯的烙印是留给惯犯或特别令人发指的罪行的，并且通常取代了监禁。犯罪分子的烙印的影响是不同的，取决于犯罪。对于轻微的犯罪，例如1000金币以下的盗窃、扰乱治安、破坏公物等，其效果是对魅力的惩罚为-3，对与犯罪有关的技能的惩罚为-5（例如，如果犯罪是盗窃，惩罚将适用于神机妙算或隐形）。GM应该按照他们认为合适的方式应用技能惩罚，但只适用于一个技能。对于重大犯罪，比如袭击、谋杀、盗窃超过1000金币或强奸，其效果是对魅力的惩罚为-5，对与犯罪有关的技能或能力的惩罚为-10（例如，如果犯罪是强奸，该惩罚可以适用于恐吓或攻击）。GM应该按照他们认为合适的方式进行惩罚，但只能对一个技能或能力进行惩罚。罪犯的烙印可以被设定为在一定的时间内消退（犯罪的刑期，通常是几周到几年），或者是永久性的（通常是最令人发指的罪行）。对带着这个标记的罪犯来说，一个意想不到的好处是，在一些犯罪圈子里，纹身者所遭受的魅力惩罚不仅会被否定，而且实际上会得到相当于惩罚价值一半的奖励（向下取整）。例如，一个小偷因为偷了一颗750gp的宝石而被打上了罪犯的烙印，他可能会发现在他的一些小偷伙伴中，他的魅力值-3的惩罚变成了+1的奖励。然而，这是GM的决定，因为被打上烙印的盗贼公会的一些成员（尤其是他的上级）可能会对他被抓住并受到惩罚感到恼火。",
	"The deserter's shame is similar to the coward's brand, although more specific. The tattoo appears as either a tattered and broken standard lying on the ground or, more simply, as the letter \"D\". The deserter is confined to one location (a garrison, castle, encampment, etc) and cannot willingly go more than 50 feet from it without suffering the effects of a bestow curse, manifesting as a sharp and intense pain in the legs and feet resulting in a -3 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. The effects double for every 50 feet beyond the limit they go. Under the effects of this curse, attributes can drop below zero and result in death. The magic of the tattoo is such that a superior officer can give the shamed tattoo bearer orders to leave the designated area for specific tasks, but if the deserter does not return by a pre-determined time the effects begin to kick in. Likewise, a superior officer can change the area the tattoo bearer is confined to as he needs to or as he sees fit. The deserter's shame punitive tattoo can never be removed by performing a heroic deed, as with the coward's brand. However, a deserter who later redeems himself can be released from the effects of the tattoo (though the physical tattoo remains in place).": "逃兵的耻辱与懦夫的烙印相似，不过更加具体。纹身表现为躺在地上的一个破烂不堪的标准，或者更简单地说，是一个字母 \"D\"。逃兵被限制在一个地方（驻军、城堡、营地等），不能自愿离开它超过50英尺，否则就会受到赐予的诅咒的影响，表现为腿和脚的剧烈疼痛，导致力量和灵活性受到-3的惩罚。每超过50英尺，效果就会加倍。在这种诅咒的影响下，属性会下降到零以下，导致死亡。纹身的魔力是这样的：上级军官可以给有耻辱感的纹身持有者下达命令，让他离开指定区域执行特定任务，但如果逃兵在预定的时间内没有回来，效果就会开始生效。同样地，上级官员可以根据需要或他认为合适的时候改变纹身者被限制的区域。逃兵的耻辱惩罚性纹身永远不能像懦夫的烙印那样，通过做英雄事迹来消除。然而，后来赎罪的逃兵可以摆脱纹身的影响（尽管身体上的纹身仍在原地）。",

	"Located on the forehead and symbolizing the person's misdeeds, the mark of atonement reveals the penitent to all, but also indicates a sincere effort at making amends.

The mark cannot be removed by any means until the bearer has successfully attained redemption, at which point the mark fades of its own accord. The mark will reappear through any disguise, alter self or similar spell or effect, or any other attempts at hiding or concealing one's appearance, and will actually glow softly in darkness. The advantage to receiving the mark of atonement rather than simply submitting to an atonement spell is that the penitent one does not need to spend thousands of gold he may not have on incense and herbs. The drawback is that unlike the spell, the mark of atonement is not instantaneous. Upon receiving the mark, the bearer is tasked with performing some deed of atonement–one who usually takes anywhere from several days to several years to accomplish. While the penitent one is not compelled to complete the task, as they would be by a geas/ quest spell, until that task is completed, the mark of atonement remains, and the penitent one is not truly forgiven of his sins.

	"Gregor Darkwanderer, a wizard and inkantationist of the northlands, didn't do as much wandering as his name might suggest. He did, however, need things, and from time to time and would hire adventurers to procure those things for him. In order to insure a sought after item's quick return, Gregor crafted a magic tattoo with a one-time use. This ink, once tattooed on a subject, acts as a greater teleport spell, recalling the subject and everything he carries/holds to the summoning room of Gregor's tower. To activate the teleportation the subject slaps the mark and shouts, \"Return!\" The magic of the tattoo affects only the tattoo bearer and her gear, familiar, and/or divine animal companion. It will not teleport more than one individual otherwise, and will not transport pets or animals not magically bound to the tattoo bearer. A side effect of the activation is that the ink burns away as the magic activates, doing 1d4 fire damage, and leaving a non-magical brand-like mark in the same shape as the original tattoo. The ingredients for the ink of this tattoo were shared with several others, and soon it spread across the world. Though carefully guarded, there are several inkantationists and wizards who know how to craft a mark of recall. The design of the tattoo is usually symbolic of the location to which the bearer is to return (the original mark of recall was an image of Gregor's tower) but when secrecy is a must, an abstract image can be used.

	"Tattoos of fierceness are usually possessed by rangers or anyone who regularly battles a specific foe, or has a hatred for a specific type of foe.

	"A tattoo of the unseen is an open eye placed at the base of the neck where it is often hidden from view by clothing and long hair.

They may still be specialists in a school of magic or be universalist wizards, and still require at least some spell components (often incorporating them into the very ink of their tattoos). In keeping with their dogma of self-reliance, tattooed wizards learn how to ink their own tattoos, and add new tattoos to their body whenever possible.

Ink Transmogrification (Ex): Beginning at 9th level, the ink of your tattoos changes, becoming infused with various metals–steel, mithral, adamantine, etc.–and this change grants you a permanent +2 natural armor bonus.

At 13th and 17th levels, the natural armor bonus increases by another +1.": "{@b Bloodline Powers}: 你的绘画遗产给了你一些独特的能力，很多都与墨水和针的艺术有关。即使是普通的纹身，你也有非凡的能力，甚至你的魔法也有一丝墨水的味道。墨水射线（Sp）：从1级开始，你可以释放一条魔法墨水射线作为范围内的触碰攻击。如果它击中了目标（一个生物），它会在你选择的颜色中留下一个可见的标记，持续的回合数等于3+你的魅力修改器。在这样的标记下，你的盟友在注意、追踪或跟踪目标的感知检查中获得+5的奖励，在对该目标的近战攻击中获得+1的奖励，在远程攻击中获得+2。这个能力每天可以使用的次数等于你的魅力修改器。魔法墨水瓶（Sp）：在3级时，你获得了将咒语暂时储存在一个世俗的纹身中的能力，可以是你自己身上的，也可以是别人身上的。储存法术会占用每天的法术槽，直到该法术被使用（一旦耗尽，休息后会正常恢复），但会一直储存下去，直到使用或通过驱散魔法或类似效果驱散。带有储存法术的纹身在有侦测魔法或类似法术的情况下会被侦测到是有魔法的。墨水转化（Ex）：从9级开始，你的纹身的墨水会发生变化，变成注入各种金属--钢、米塔尔、金刚砂等--这种变化赋予你永久的+2自然护甲奖励。这种变化并不改变你的纹身的外观。在13级和17级时，自然护甲加成又增加了+1。",
	"{@i Living Ink (Sp)}: At 15th level, you can infuse life into your creature tattoos, summoning them to assist you for a short time. This ability functions as a summon monster VII spell, summoning the selected tattoo creature for 1 round/level. The tattoo disappears from your body while active; if the creature is destroyed in combat, you take 1d4 non-lethal damage and the tattoo does not reappear until you have rested for at least 8 hours. To summon a creature, you must have a tattoo of the creature on your body (for instance, you cannot use this ability to summon a dire bear if you do not have a dire bear tattoo somewhere on your body). This can be used once per day at 15th level and twice per day at 19th level.": "{@i Living Ink (Sp)}: 15级时，你可以将生命注入你的生物纹身，召唤它们在短时间内协助你。这个能力的作用如同召唤怪物七号咒语，召唤所选的纹身生物，持续1轮/级。纹身在激活时从你的身体上消失；如果该生物在战斗中被摧毁，你会受到1d4的非致命伤害，并且在你休息了至少8小时后，纹身才会重新出现。要召唤一个生物，你的身体上必须有该生物的纹身（例如，如果你的身体上某处没有可怕的熊的纹身，你就不能使用这个能力来召唤可怕的熊）。这个能力在15级时每天可以使用一次，在19级时每天可以使用两次。",
	"{@i Inked Master (20th)}: The ink on your skin becomes infused with your arcane power, and every magical tattoo has added potential. Whenever you activate a power from a wondrous tattoo that has a duration measured in rounds, you increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to half your sorcerer level. If the duration is measured in minutes or hours, you increase the duration by a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. Any tattoo with a limited number of uses per day can be used one extra time each day. Also, any damage delivered to a foe through the power of one of your tattoos adds a bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier. Finally, a number of tattoos equal to your Charisma modifier are treated as if they were created with the Compact Tattoo feat. This applies only to existing tattoos, not to tattoos received after you gain this bloodline power, and this does not affect any tattoo already created with the Compact Tattoo feat.": "{@i Inked Master (20th)}: 你皮肤上的墨水会注入你的奥术力量，每一个神奇的纹身都有额外的潜力。每当你从一个奇妙的纹身中激活一个持续时间以回合计算的力量时，你会增加相当于你巫师等级一半的回合数。如果持续时间是以分钟或小时计算的，你会增加相当于你巫师等级的分钟数。任何每天有使用次数限制的纹身，每天可以额外使用一次。另外，通过你的纹身的力量对敌人造成的任何伤害都会增加相当于你的魅力修正值的伤害奖励。最后，与你的魅力修饰值相等的纹身数量会被视为用紧凑纹身特技创造的。这只适用于现有的纹身，而不是在你获得这种血统力量后得到的纹身，而且这不影响任何已经用紧凑纹身特技创造的纹身。",
	"While some adventurers use body art to protect themselves, to gain a magical attack, or to record a couple of experiences, painted ones choose to wear their entire lives on their skin. They move beyond simple designs and rebellious urges to master the personal icons impressed into their flesh. Their origins, talents, and trials are traced in symbols and script across their limbs–but only painted ones understand the deeper meanings behind each piece. From those meanings, they are able to draw more power from their ink than most others find possible.": "有些冒险家用人体艺术来保护自己，获得魔法攻击，或者记录一些经历，而画画的人则选择将自己的整个生命都穿在皮肤上。他们超越了简单的设计和叛逆的冲动，掌握了印在他们肉体上的个人图标。他们的出身、才能和考验都以符号和文字的形式出现在他们的四肢上--但只有彩绘者明白每件作品背后的深层含义。从这些意义中，他们能够从他们的墨水中汲取更多的力量，而不是其他大多数人认为可能的。",
	"{@b Role}: Painted ones travel in search of new abilities and designs for their body art, and along the way they typically offer stealth and arcane support.

She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known, and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a painted one, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. If the character had no levels in an arcane spellcasting class (qualifying for the painted one prestige class through class or racial features), she gains spells initially as a 1st level bard, and bard is considered her existing spellcasting class for further advancement of spellcasting ability.": "{@b Spells per Day}: 在2、3、4、6、8、9级时，该角色每天获得新的法术，就像她在参加声望等级之前也获得了她所属的奥术法术等级一样。然而，除了每天获得额外的法术、已知的法术和增加的有效法术等级外，她并没有获得该等级的人物所能获得的其他好处。如果一个角色在成为画中人之前有一个以上的奥术法术等级，她必须决定将新的等级加到哪个等级上，以确定每天的法术。如果该角色在奥术法术类中没有任何等级（通过等级或种族特征有资格成为绘者声望类），她最初会以1级吟游诗人的身份获得法术，吟游诗人被视为她现有的法术类，用于进一步提高法术能力。",
	"{@b Enhanced Ink (Sp)}: The flesh of a painted one is a specially prepared canvas, and it yields greater results from magical body art. At 1st, 5th and 9th levels, painted ones who activate a tattoo power with a duration gain 1 additional round (if the duration is measured in rounds) or 1 additional minute (if the duration is measured in minutes or hours) of its effect. This benefit may be used once per day per painted one level.": "{@b Enhanced Ink (Sp)}: 彩绘者的肉体是一块特别准备的画布，它能从神奇的人体艺术中产生更大的效果。在1级、5级和9级时，激活有持续时间的纹身能力的彩绘者会获得额外的1轮（如果持续时间以轮为单位）或1分钟（如果持续时间以分钟或小时为单位）的效果。这个好处每天可以在每个绘者等级使用一次。",

	"{@b Marks of the Past}: Painted ones blend their new art with their earlier training. At 2nd level and every other level thereafter, a painted one can select one special ability she could have obtained if she had remained in a different class and gained a level in it. In order to activate the ability in question, she must have a tattoo dedicated to her former class and the tattoo must be uncovered for the duration of the effect.": "{@b Marks of the Past}: 绘画的人将他们的新艺术与他们早期的训练相融合。在2级和之后的每一级，彩绘师可以选择一种她可以获得的特殊能力，如果她留在不同的等级并在其中获得一个等级。为了激活该能力，她必须有一个专用于她以前等级的纹身，并且该纹身在效果持续期间必须被揭开。",
	"For example, a 4th level rogue/2nd level painted one could increase her sneak attack to +3d6, choose a rogue talent, or advance her trap sense to +2.

A series of three DC 25 Craft (Tattoo/Body Artist Supplies) checks are required by the artist to bind the weapon to the body art. The ritual requires three days, and one Craft check is made each day. By the end of the ritual, 500 gp of ink and supplies must be spent per +1 of the weapon's enhancement (consider the total bonus value of the weapon, so a +1 flaming shortsword counts as a +2 weapon, and thus requires 1,000 gp worth of ink and supplies). The weapon cannot weigh more than 10 pounds, nor can it be more than 6 feet long. The corresponding tattoo does not have to resemble the weapon, or any weapon, but if the tattoo does resemble the weapon, the painted one receives a +5 bonus to each of the Craft checks.": "{@b Tattoo Weapon (Sp)}: 绘者可以将一件具有至少+1奖励的魔法武器与一个新的世俗纹身神秘地联系起来。画师需要进行一系列的DC25工艺（纹身/身体艺术家用品）检查，以将武器与人体艺术结合起来。仪式需要三天时间，每天进行一次工艺检查。在仪式结束时，武器的每+1的强化必须花费500GP的墨水和用品（考虑到武器的总奖励价值，所以+1的火焰短剑算作+2的武器，因此需要价值1000GP的墨水和用品）。武器的重量不能超过10磅，长度也不能超过6英尺。相应的纹身不必与武器或任何武器相似，但如果纹身确实与武器相似，被画的人就会在每次工艺检查中获得+5的奖励。",
	"Once the ritual is successfully completed, the weapon can be magically stored inside the tattoo and can be summoned with a command word as a move action. It will appear in the painted one's hand or, if her hands are full or bound, at her feet. The tattoo must be visible for the weapon to be called forth, and remain visible for the duration of the effect. The weapon will manifest for 1 minute per caster level, after which it disappears back into the tattoo. A painted one can call on her weapon twice per day at 5th level, 3 times per day at 7th level, and 4 times per day at 9th level.": "一旦仪式成功完成，武器可以被神奇地储存在纹身内，并且可以用一个命令词作为移动动作来召唤。它将会出现在被画者的手中，如果她的手已满或被束缚，则出现在她的脚下。纹身必须是可见的，武器才能被召唤出来，并在效果持续期间保持可见。武器会在每个施法者等级中显现1分钟，之后就会消失在纹身中。绘者在5级时每天可以召唤她的武器两次，7级时每天3次，9级时每天4次。",
	"If the tattoo is somehow removed while the weapon is inside it, the weapon and the link to the weapon are lost forever. If the weapon is damaged while it is in use, its pieces may be returned to the ink, but they will not re-form or regenerate and it will appear as a broken weapon when called forth again. The weapon will have to be repaired (by mundane or magical methods) before it is useable again. A new weapon cannot be linked to a tattoo that has housed another weapon; a new piece of art will have to be applied to bind a new weapon, and the ritual costs will have to be paid again.": "如果武器在纹身内时，纹身被以某种方式移除，武器和与武器的联系就会永远消失。如果武器在使用过程中被损坏，其碎片可以返回到墨水中，但它们不会重新形成或再生，当再次被召唤时，它将显示为一个破碎的武器。该武器在再次使用前必须进行修复（通过世俗或魔法方法）。新的武器不能与已经安置了另一件武器的纹身相联系；必须应用新的艺术作品来绑定新的武器，而且必须重新支付仪式费用。",
	"{@b Sentient Tattoo (Su)}: At 10th level, a painted one can awaken intelligence in one of her existing tattoos, or do so for a newly applied piece. A ritual is performed to grant sentience to the design, which must reflect the personality and traits the painted one wants the tattoo to have. The tattoo must resemble an animal or creature that normally is not sentient, or an object, such as a weapon or item. A tattoo previously designated as a tattoo weapon by the painted one cannot also be a sentient tattoo. The tattoo has the same alignment as the painted one, can communicate telepathically with the painted one, and has blindsense 60 feet.": "{@b Sentient Tattoo (Su)}: 在10级的时候，彩绘师可以唤醒她现有纹身中的智力，或者对新的纹身进行唤醒。一个仪式会被执行以赋予设计的智慧，它必须反映出绘者希望纹身具有的个性和特征。纹身必须类似于通常没有灵性的动物或生物，或者是一个物体，比如武器或物品。之前被绘者指定为纹身武器的纹身不能同时成为有生命的纹身。纹身的排列方式与被画者相同，可以与被画者进行心灵感应，并具有60英尺的盲觉。",
	"A painted one can only have one sentient tattoo at a time, and the awakening is permanent unless spells like wish or miracle are invoked to permanently dispel it.

If the painted one's alignment changes, the alignment of her sentient tattoo remains the same, despite any penalties that might bring.": "一个被画的人一次只能有一个有生命的纹身，而且觉醒是永久性的，除非调用像愿望或奇迹这样的咒语来永久地驱除它。移除带有有情纹身的肢体会使其暂时失去功能，但如果肢体被恢复，纹身会再次发挥作用。如果画中人的排列方式改变了，她的有生命的纹身的排列方式也会保持不变，尽管这可能带来任何惩罚。",
	"A sentient tattoo essentially functions in ways similar to a wizard's familiar or bonded object. The sentient tattoo can cast any one spell the painted one knows once per day, without using up a spell slot. This spell cannot be modified with metamagic feats.

As they progress in rank over the years, they receive further tattoos to mark their progress. By tradition, all new tattoos received by a member of the Order must be done with traditional hand-held needles, not with machines or magical tattooing devices. As members learn self-discipline, they learn to channel away the pain of receiving a tattoo. For every 4 monk levels the member has increased vigor, or 1 temp hp which regenerates on each short or long rest. Because members of the Order are forbidden from owning much in the way of material goods (no more than 500 gp worth of gear and magic items), most cover their bodies with magical tattoos to help protect themselves, aid them in combat, and provide other bonuses. Outside of their own region, Ryueken Order members are sometimes mistaken for tattooed wizards, inked bloodline sorcerers, or painted ones. The Ryueken Order has no mark for former members–members are free to come and go as they please, and are always considered welcome at the monastery. The order rarely asks a member to leave, but those who cannot maintain lawful tendencies do not fit in with the tenets of the order. Members who shift alignment or break other tenets of the order, are marked and forcibly removed from the monastery grounds.

	"Originally created long ago by the Amaranthine order of wizards, the knowledge and ability to create the tattoo has since spread much more widely. A single finger sleeve doubles the number of spells an arcane caster can cast each day; with the spell level doubled the same as the sleeve level (similar to a ring of wizardry). Because of the nature of the tattoos, a wizard must have the lesser version before getting the next step tattooed (for instance, a wizard cannot simply have a sleeve III, she must also have a sleeve I and II). Thus, if a wizard wishes to receive a sleeve III tattoo, the costs (and benefits) of sleeves I and II are added to the cost of the sleeve III (130,000 gp total). As each sleeve is added, it takes up another tattoo slot, so a sleeve V takes up a ring slot, hand slot, wrist slot, shoulder slot and back slot, and the tattoo covers all five fingers, the hand, the entire arm, the top and back of the shoulder and upper back, and the lower back. The wizard with such a tattoo has the number of spells of 1st through 5th levels he can cast each day doubled. Since the decline of the Amaranthine Order in recent decades, no one has seen a wizard with a sleeve V, though there are rumors of powerful liches or vampire wizards with such tattoos.": "纹身最初是很久以前由阿玛兰丁巫师团创造的，后来创造纹身的知识和能力传播得更广。一个单指套可以使奥术施法者每天施放的法术数量翻倍；法术等级翻倍与套的等级相同（类似于巫师之环）。由于纹身的性质，一个巫师在得到下一步的纹身之前必须拥有较低的版本（例如，一个巫师不能简单地拥有一个袖子III，她还必须拥有一个袖子I和II）。因此，如果一个巫师希望得到一个袖子III的纹身，那么袖子I和袖子II的费用（和好处）会加到袖子III的费用上（共130,000GP）。随着每一个袖子的增加，它又占用了一个纹身槽，所以一个五号袖子占用了一个戒指槽、手槽、手腕槽、肩膀槽和背部槽，纹身覆盖了所有五个手指、手、整个手臂、肩膀和上背部的顶部和背部，以及下背部。拥有这种纹身的巫师，每天可以施展的1至5级法术数量翻倍。自从近几十年来亚马逊教团衰落以来，没有人见过有V型袖子的巫师，尽管有传言说强大的地衣或吸血鬼巫师有这种纹身。",

	"This tattoo when activated, allows the character to conjure a single gold coin. It is a real coin, and may be used as such, but it only remains in existence for 1 hour. Whatever coin image is tattooed in the palm is the type of coin that is conjured, so all conjured coins look exactly alike. The tattooed character can conjure one coin per round. If multiple coins are spent in the same place, a Perception [DC 16] Investigation [DC 12] check allows the person receiving the coins to notice something odd about them (that they are all identical). The name of the tattoo comes not from the creator of the tattoo–as most named wondrous tattoos do–but rather from the name of the most unfortunate person to ever bear the tattoo. Cantrell Ovin was a wainwright in a tiny village who once repaired the wagon of the traveling inkantationist Rezol Ungmir. As payment, Rezol gave Cantrell the coin tattoo, but the only gold coin he had as a likeness was one from a far away empire. Rezol warned Cantrell to use the power of the tattoo sparingly and discretly. Unfortunately, Cantrell did not heed the warning and used the coins everywhere, in grand fashion. It didn't take long for the locals to notice that only Cantrell spent the foreign coins, which always disappeared within 24 hours. Less than a month after receiving the tattoo, Cantrell Ovin was hanged as a thief. His name stuck to the wondrous tattoo afterward as a warning for others to heed Rezol Ungmir's warning of discretion.": "这个纹身被激活后，可以让角色变出一枚金币。它是一个真正的硬币，并且可以这样使用，但它只存在1小时。纹在手掌上的金币图像就是所变出的金币类型，所以所有变出的金币看起来都一模一样。纹身的人物每回合可以变出一个硬币。如果多个硬币被花在同一个地方，通过感知[DC16]调查[DC12]检查可以让接受硬币的人注意到它们的奇怪之处（它们都是一样的）。纹身的名字不是来自于纹身的创造者--就像大多数被命名的奇妙纹身一样--而是来自于最不幸的人的名字，他曾经拥有这个纹身。坎特雷尔-奥文是一个小村庄的锻工，他曾经修理过旅行中的喷墨者雷佐尔-昂米尔的马车。作为报酬，Rezol给了Cantrell金币纹身，但他唯一的金币是来自一个遥远的帝国的像。雷索尔警告坎特雷尔要谨慎地使用纹身的力量。不幸的是，坎特雷尔没有听从警告，到处使用金币，大行其道。没过多久，当地人就注意到，只有坎特雷尔花了这些外国硬币，而这些硬币总是在24小时内消失。收到纹身后不到一个月，坎特雷尔-奥文就被当作小偷吊死了。他的名字后来一直停留在这个奇妙的纹身上，作为对其他人的警告，让他们听从雷佐尔-昂米尔的警告，谨慎行事。",

	"A criminal's brand is a magical tattoo or brand that marks a criminal. The mark is in the form of a letter representing the crime–\"R\" for rape, \"T\" for theft, \"M\" for murder, etc. In most societies, the criminal's brand is reserved for repeat offenders or for especially heinous crimes and usually takes the place of imprisonment. The effects of a criminal's brand are varied, depending on the crime. For minor crimes, such as theft under 1,000 gp, disturbing the peace, vandalism, etc., the effect is a -2 penalty to Charisma and disadvantage for checks to a skill related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was theft, the penalty would apply to Sleight of Hand and/or Stealth). GMs should apply the skill penalty as they see fit, but to only a single skill. For major crimes, such as assault, murder, theft over 1,000 gp, or rape, the effect is a -2 penalty to Charisma and a -10 penalty to a skill or ability related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was rape, the penalty could apply to Intimidate or to attack). GMs should apply the penalty as they see fit, but to only one skill or ability. The criminal's brand can be set to fade after a certain length of time (the sentence for the crime, usually a few weeks to a couple of years) or to be permanent (usually the case for the most heinous of crimes). An unexpected benefit to criminals who bear the mark is that in some criminal circles, the Charisma penalty suffered by the tattoo bearer is not only negated, but a bonus equal to half the value of the penalty is actually received (round down). For instance, a thief who receives the criminal's brand for stealing a 750 gp gem might find that among some of his fellow thieves his -3 penalty to Charisma becomes a +1 bonus. This is a GM's decision, however, for some members of the branded thief's guild (especially his superiors) might be irritated he was caught and punished.": "罪犯的烙印是一种标记罪犯的神奇纹身或烙印。烙印的形式是代表犯罪的字母--\"R \"代表强奸，\"T \"代表偷窃，\"M \"代表谋杀，等等。在大多数社会中，罪犯的烙印是留给惯犯或特别令人发指的罪行的，并且通常取代了监禁。犯罪分子的烙印的影响是不同的，取决于犯罪。对于轻微的犯罪，例如1000金币以下的盗窃、扰乱治安、破坏公物等，其效果是对魅力的惩罚是-2，对与犯罪有关的技能的检查是不利的（例如，如果犯罪是盗窃，惩罚将适用于神机妙算和/或隐形）。GM应该按照他们认为合适的方式应用技能惩罚，但只适用于一个技能。对于重大犯罪，比如袭击、谋杀、盗窃超过1000金币或强奸，其效果是对魅力的惩罚为-2，对与犯罪有关的技能或能力的惩罚为-10（例如，如果犯罪是强奸，该惩罚可以适用于恐吓或攻击）。GM应该按照他们认为合适的方式进行惩罚，但只能对一个技能或能力进行惩罚。罪犯的烙印可以被设定为在一定的时间内消退（犯罪的刑期，通常是几周到几年），或者是永久性的（通常是最令人发指的罪行）。对带着这个标记的罪犯来说，一个意想不到的好处是，在一些犯罪圈子里，纹身者所遭受的魅力惩罚不仅会被否定，而且实际上会得到相当于惩罚价值一半的奖励（向下取整）。例如，一个小偷因为偷了一颗750gp的宝石而被打上了罪犯的烙印，他可能会发现在他的一些小偷伙伴中，他的魅力值-3的惩罚变成了+1的奖励。然而，这是GM的决定，因为被打上烙印的盗贼公会的一些成员（尤其是他的上级）可能会对他被抓住并受到惩罚感到恼火。",

For every 30 feet beyond the limit they go, they gain another level of exhaustion and the loss of 5ft from their movement. The magic of the tattoo is such that a superior officer can give the shamed tattoo bearer orders to leave the designated area for specific tasks, but if the deserter does not return by a pre-determined time the effects begin to kick in. Likewise, a superior officer can change the area the tattoo bearer is confined to as he needs to or as he sees fit.

The drawback is that unlike the spell, the mark of atonement is not instantaneous. Upon receiving the mark, the bearer is tasked with performing some deed of atonement–one who usually takes anywhere from several days to several years to accomplish. While the penitent one is not compelled to complete the task, as they would be by a geas/ quest spell, until that task is completed, the mark of atonement remains, and the penitent one is not truly forgiven of his sins.

He did, however, need things, and from time to time and would hire adventurers to procure those things for him. In order to insure a sought after item's quick return, Gregor crafted a magic tattoo with a one-time use. This ink, once tattooed on a subject, acts as a teleport spell, recalling the subject and everything he carries/holds to the summoning room of Gregor's tower. To activate the teleportation the subject slaps the mark and shouts, \"Return!\" The magic of the tattoo affects only the tattoo bearer and her gear, familiar, and/or divine animal companion. It will not teleport more than one individual otherwise, and will not transport pets or animals not magically bound to the tattoo bearer. A side effect of the activation is that the ink burns away as the magic activates, doing 1d4 fire damage, and leaving a non-magical brand-like mark in the same shape as the original tattoo. The ingredients for the ink of this tattoo were shared with several others, and soon it spread across the world. Though carefully guarded, there are several inkantationists and wizards who know how to craft a mark of recall.

	"When you do consider the races, elves infrequently use tattoos as they prefer the unspoiled beauty of natural forms. However, their appreciation of beauty means that when they do adopt the art they usually master it with the same graceful and intricate design work seen in their architecture and clothing, using the tattoo to enhance the beauty of its wearer. Orcs usually use cruder materials under the care of less skilled craftsmen. Their tattoos are often rough, larger, in a few brash colors and have an almost smeared quality to them. Not surprisingly, these tattoos are easier to see at a distance and are more useful on a battlefield. Halflings rarely adopt tattooing in their native cultures, though some who live among humans develop a taste for it. Gnomes use tattoos even less than halflings do, with a few rare crafters' guilds adopting the use to show rank among colleagues. Of the so called 'short races' dwarves are probably the only race to widely adopt tattoos, though it is far from universal. For example, dwarven miners or soldiers may get ink done after getting drunk (and dying their beards pink). Humans are the most creative and diverse of tattoo enthusiasts, though they are also so varied as to defy generalization.": "当你考虑到这些种族时，精灵们不常使用纹身，因为他们更喜欢自然形式的未受破坏的美。然而，他们对美的欣赏意味着，当他们采用这种艺术时，他们通常会用他们的建筑和服装中看到的同样优雅和复杂的设计工作来掌握它，用纹身来增强佩戴者的美。兽人通常在不太熟练的工匠的照料下使用粗糙的材料。他们的纹身通常是粗糙的，较大的，有一些粗暴的颜色，并且有一种几乎被涂抹的质量。毫不奇怪，这些纹身在远处更容易看到，在战场上也更有用。半身人在他们的本土文化中很少采用纹身，尽管一些生活在人类中的半身人对纹身产生了兴趣。地精比半身人更少使用纹身，只有少数罕见的手工业者行会采用纹身来显示同事之间的等级。在所谓的 \"矮小种族 \"中，矮人可能是唯一广泛采用纹身的种族，尽管这远非普遍现象。例如，矮人矿工或士兵在喝醉后可能会做墨水（并将他们的胡须染成粉红色）。人类是最具创造性和多样性的纹身爱好者，尽管他们也是如此多样，以至于无法概括。",
	"Wilderness cultures characteristically have rather abstract, stylized tattoos that are deeply reminiscent of the pictographs many tribes use to record tribal history and legends. Such tattoos may appear crude, but in truth tribal tattoos do not attempt for realistic representations. Instead, they attempt to capture the 'spirit' of what they depict in an abstract manner. For example, a tattoo that, to the civilized eye, might look like a cluster of jagged lines with a serpentine track between them, may represent the mountain stream where the tribe successfully fought off a lethal invader. Lines and circles depicting natural cycles are also common motifs. Of particular note are tattoos mimicking tribal war paint–warriors who are inked with permanent war paint are often berserkers, lethal in combat and troublesome in peace, who even members of the same tribe will give a wide berth. Such tattoos are both an honorific and a warning. Tribal tattoos are also a means of identification and unity. Outsiders wearing tattoos that look like tribal tattoos will instantly be viewed with suspicion and unless they can convince a tribal member they earned the tattoo in a fitting manner (successful Persuasion or Deception check with -5 circumstance penalty), are likely to be attacked and if they're lucky, only have the offending tattoo forcibly removed (see Tattoo Removal in Chapter 1).": "荒野文化的特点是有相当抽象的、风格化的纹身，让人深深联想到许多部落用来记录部落历史和传说的象形文字。这种纹身可能看起来很粗糙，但事实上，部落纹身并不试图进行现实的表述。相反，他们试图以一种抽象的方式捕捉他们所描绘的 \"精神\"。例如，在文明人的眼中，一个纹身可能看起来像一簇锯齿状的线条，在它们之间有一条蛇形的轨迹，但它可能代表部落成功击退致命入侵者的山涧。描绘自然周期的线条和圆圈也是常见的图案。特别值得注意的是模仿部落战争颜料的纹身--涂有永久战争颜料的战士往往是狂暴者，在战斗中是致命的，在和平时期是麻烦的，即使是同一个部落的成员也会对他们敬而远之。这样的纹身既是一种尊称，也是一种警告。部落纹身也是一种识别和团结的手段。除非他们能以合适的方式让部落成员相信他们获得了这个纹身（劝说或欺骗检查成功，环境惩罚为-5），否则很可能会被攻击，如果他们幸运的话，只会被强行移除违规的纹身（见第一章的纹身移除）。"
