	"He has short, wavy, red hair and rugged, pockmarked, white skin. He applauds the characters for getting past his goons before attacking. Bayo is careful to reserve his reaction for feather fall.

	"Well, would you look at that? Dreams do come true!": "好吧，你会看吗？梦想是可以实现的!",
	"That might actually sound a little more dramatic than intended, but that's just how I see it. What started out as a tiny idea after playing through a popular video game where a bald man and his whiny child climb a treacherous mountain (or two) has turned into what you see before you.": "这听起来实际上可能比预想的要夸张一些，但这就是我的看法。起初只是在玩过一个流行的视频游戏后的一个小小的想法，在这个游戏中，一个光头男人和他的发牢骚的孩子爬上了一座险峻的山（或两座），变成了你眼前的这一切。",
	"This is a labor of love, a collaborative work of art, and, in my humble opinion, a worthwhile supplement to your game. The team that put this together spent a lot of time and effort to ensure that the various tattoos you see in this book are gorgeous, fun, and mechanically sound. On top of that, there is an adventure and a brand new class waiting for you within these pages that we are very proud to include in this book.": "这是爱的结晶，是艺术的合作作品，以我的愚见，这是对你的游戏值得的补充。编写这本书的团队花费了大量的时间和精力，以确保你在书中看到的各种纹身是华丽的、有趣的，并且在机制上是合理的。除此之外，在这些页面中还有一个冒险和一个全新的等级在等着你，我们非常自豪地将其纳入本书中。",
	"I do have to make sure that I thank all the backers who made this project possible. A lot of people say it, but in this case, you all know this to be true. I would not have been able to do this without you. Thank you for believing in me and in this idea, and for trusting in the quality of work you would receive. I hope that you continue to support my team at Natwuns as we strive to provide meaningful products that add to your tabletop gaming experience.": "我确实要确保感谢所有使这个项目成为可能的支持者。很多人都这么说，但在这种情况下，你们都知道这是真的。没有你们，我不可能做到这一点。感谢你们相信我和这个想法，感谢你们相信你们将收到的作品的质量。我希望你们继续支持我在Natwuns的团队，因为我们努力提供有意义的产品，增加你们的桌面游戏体验。",
	"So yes, I urge you to \"liberate your imagination\". That's why we play, right? Not simply as an escape, but to bring to life all the magical ideas that live inside us as well. Use our tome wisely adventurer, to further the enjoyment, excitement, and enchantment for your party! And remember: you don't have to strictly follow the rules written here. Feel free to carve out your own path whenever you need to.": "因此，是的，我敦促你 \"解放你的想象力\"。这就是我们玩的原因，对吗？不仅仅是为了逃避，而是为了将所有生活在我们内心深处的神奇想法变为现实。明智地使用我们的小册子吧，冒险家，为你的聚会带来更多的乐趣、刺激和魅力 请记住：你不必严格遵守这里的规则。只要你需要，就可以自由地开辟你自己的道路。",

	"Mystical tattoos are an ancient form of magic that imparts bearers with extraordinary gifts. They can be seen on any creature willing to allow magic to be embedded deeper into their being than ever before.": "神秘的纹身是一种古老的魔法形式，赋予持有者非凡的天赋。它们可以在任何愿意让魔法比以往任何时候都更深入地嵌入其体内的生物身上看到。",
	"A tattoo's magical properties are born of their magically imbued designs, often a testament to the original tattooist's expertise. A great example of this is a special variant of magic tattoos known as spellbangers, smaller designs replicating arcane spellcasting, restricted to the same tattooist that created them.": "纹身的魔法属性源于其被注入魔法的设计，通常是原始纹身师专业知识的证明。这方面的一个很好的例子是被称为 \"咒语者 \"的魔法纹身的特殊变体，这些较小的设计复制了奥秘的咒语，只限于创造它们的同一个纹身师。",
	"Magic tattoos are imbued with power by their creators. While sketching, tattooists weave their magics directly into the ink of their design. The design is layered with intent, serving as both pathway and instructions for the tattooist's magic. This can be an impossible task for those inexperienced in the tattooists' method. In a process that takes just a few seconds after the design's completion, the magic blooms within the design, and it acquires its intended effect or property.": "魔法纹身被其创造者灌输了力量。在绘制草图时，纹身师将他们的魔法直接编织到设计的墨水中。设计是分层的，作为纹身师魔法的途径和指示。对于那些对纹身师的方法没有经验的人来说，这可能是一项不可能完成的任务。在设计完成后仅需几秒钟的过程中，魔法在设计中绽放，并获得其预期效果或属性。",
	"The practice adopted by tattooists for distributing their magic tattoos is simple and permits them to benefit from their work, while still allowing for tattoos to be widely accessible. Magic tattoos are initially sketched within the pages of an enchanted sketchbook by a tattooist. After the design is drawn on an enchanted sketchbook page, any individual may extract that tattoo into an empty needle using tattooist's tools. This allows designs to be more easily distributed or acquired. The page is empty once the design is extracted, but a special needle is now ready to be applied.": "纹身师分发魔法纹身的做法很简单，允许他们从自己的工作中获益，同时还允许纹身被广泛使用。魔法纹身最初是由纹身师在魔法素描本的页面上画出的。在魔法素描本的页面上画出图案后，任何个人都可以使用纹身师的工具将该纹身提取到空针上。这使得设计可以更容易地被传播或获得。一旦图案被提取出来，这一页就是空的，但现在特殊的针头已经准备好被应用。",
	"The creator's whims often drive the initial design, but this can be steered by other individuals requiring a particular result. Some would say that this is what sets magic tattoos apart from other magic items. The degree of control that tattooists have over their designs while applying their artistry and magics often yields truly remarkable results, limited only by their skill and imagination.": "创作者的奇思妙想往往推动了最初的设计，但这也可以由其他要求特定结果的人引导。有人会说，这就是魔法纹身与其他魔法物品的区别。纹身师在应用他们的艺术和魔法时，对其设计的控制程度往往产生真正非凡的结果，只受限于他们的技能和想象力。",
	"The {@item tattooist's tools|ToMT} are a type of artisan's tools consisting of two main components - the {@item hammer|ToMT} and {@item chisel|ToMT}. The chisel contains a simple mechanism that can twist to clasp onto needles of various widths. The hammer can act as an activator when it strikes the chisel, temporarily applying a magnetic property unique to magically-imbued inks into the needle.": "{@item tattooist's tools|ToMT}是一种工匠的工具，由两个主要部件组成--{@item hammer|ToMT}和{@item chisel|ToMT}。凿子包含一个简单的机制，可以扭动以扣住各种宽度的针头。锤子在敲击凿子时可以作为一个激活器，暂时将神奇的墨水所特有的磁性特性应用到针上。",
	"One of the main uses of tattooist's tools in regards to magic tattoos is extraction. An individual holds the chisel affixed with an empty needle against an {@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT} page or skin upon which a magic tattoo is applied. The wielder then taps the opposite end of the chisel, drawing the tattoo design inside of the affixed, empty needle.": "纹身师的工具在魔法纹身方面的主要用途之一是提取。一个人拿着贴有空针的凿子，对着被施以魔法纹身的页面或皮肤（%0%）。然后施术者敲击凿子的另一端，在贴着的空针头内绘制纹身图案。",
	"The tattooist's tools also include plenty of needles and medical supplies for sterilization. This is necessary in case the tattooist's tools are used to apply mundane tattoos as well. For non-magical tattoo applications, the chisel's needle can be dipped into the appropriate pigments and then hammered against an individual's skin, scales, or feathers to ink a tattoo.": "纹身师的工具还包括大量针头和用于消毒的医疗用品。如果纹身师的工具也被用来进行世俗的纹身，这是必要的。对于非魔法纹身的应用，凿子的针头可以蘸上适当的颜料，然后在个人的皮肤、鳞片或羽毛上敲打，以涂上纹身。",
	"Applying a magic tattoo from a needle simply requires that the special needle be held against one's skin. A magic tattoo counts towards the number of magic items to which a creature can attune.": "使用针头的魔法纹身只需要将特殊的针头顶在自己的皮肤上。一个魔法纹身可以计入一个生物所能适应的魔法物品的数量。",
	"The design slowly flows from the needle into the skin upon contact, molding itself to suit the individual's body. An applied tattoo appears as it did on its sketchbook page, retaining the visual properties of the ink used when it was sketched. In this way, the design transitions from page to person through a needle.": "设计在接触时慢慢地从针头流进皮肤，形成自己的形状以适应个人的身体。一个应用的纹身就像它在素描本上的样子，保留了素描时所用墨水的视觉特性。通过这种方式，设计通过针头从页面过渡到人。",
	"For unusual skin types, the tattoo will often take on a different form. As an example, a creature covered in fur or feathers might witness the tattoo take shape as markings as it leaves the needle. A creature with a metallic exterior might see the tattoo engrave itself onto their shell. As a tattoo is simply another form of magic item, this can be interpreted as the attunement process.": "对于不寻常的皮肤类型，纹身往往会以不同的形式出现。例如，被皮毛或羽毛覆盖的生物可能会看到纹身在离开针头时以标记的形式出现。具有金属外观的生物可能会看到纹身在它们的外壳上刻下自己。由于纹身只是另一种形式的魔法物品，这可以被解释为调和过程。",
	"The process to end attunement to a magic tattoo is different from the process to end attunement to a normal magic item. A creature other than the one to whom the tattoo is applied must use tattooist's tools and an empty needle to extract the tattoo from the skin, as it was once extracted from a tattooist's sketchbook page.": "结束对魔法纹身的调和的过程与结束对普通魔法物品的调和的过程不同。纹身者以外的生物必须使用纹身师的工具和空针头从皮肤上提取纹身，就像曾经从纹身师的素描本上提取一样。",
	"While there is undoubtedly more beauty to admire in tattoos of increasing size and complexity, these factors often belie their true potential.": "虽然在越来越大和越来越复杂的纹身中，无疑有更多的美值得欣赏，但这些因素往往掩盖了它们的真正潜力。",
	"A more pertinent factor to investigate when shopping for a new tattoo is the original intent behind its design and, of course, aesthetics. These factors will determine whether the tattoo suits its future bearer and whether the tattoo will work in harmony with their existing abilities. You will find that tattoos ranging drastically in rarity and power can be of the same proportion.": "在选购新的纹身时，需要调查的一个更相关的因素是其设计背后的初衷，当然还有美学。这些因素将决定该纹身是否适合其未来的持有者，以及该纹身是否能与他们现有的能力相协调。你会发现，在稀有度和力量方面差异巨大的纹身可以是同一种比例。",
	"Also of note, magic tattoos that are applied on the same body part can coexist. All magic tattoos can be layered upon each other, with individuals not having to fear for their properties being tainted or diminished. Magic tattoos are sketched with purpose, and are not so easily disrupted simply by their proximity to one other. In this case, an individual can mentally decide which tattoo sits at the forefront to make it so.": "同样值得注意的是，应用在同一身体部位的魔法纹身可以共存。所有的魔法纹身都可以相互叠加，个人不必担心自己的属性被玷污或减弱。魔法纹身的绘制是有目的的，不会因为彼此的接近而轻易中断。在这种情况下，个人可以在精神上决定哪个纹身处于最重要的位置，使之成为最重要的。",
	"Although magic tattoos should initially be applied to a specific body part, the magic connects more intimately with the host as time progresses. In the event a tattoo is damaged or a body part lost, the tattoo retains its magical properties and will immediately shift to the next most appropriate part of the attuned individual's body (GM's choice).": "尽管魔法纹身最初应该应用于特定的身体部位，但随着时间的推移，魔法与宿主的联系会更加紧密。如果纹身被损坏或身体部位丢失，纹身会保留其魔法属性，并会立即转移到被调谐者身体的下一个最合适的部位（GM的选择）。",
	"Stepping into your first tattoo parlor can be an overwhelming experience. You will find {@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT} pages plastered on the walls, showcasing the sitting tattoo artist's work, as well those of their colleagues. Tattooist's tools, from the basic copper to gold-plated, will be available for purchase, often along with a plethora of swirling, colorful, and iridescent inks lining the shelves.": "踏入你的第一家纹身店可能是一个令人不知所措的经历。你会发现墙上贴着{@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT}页，展示着坐着的纹身师的作品，以及他们同事的作品。纹身师的工具，从基本的铜制到镀金的，都可以买到，往往还有大量旋转的、五颜六色的、彩虹色的墨水在架子上摆放。",
	"Tattooists use ink as they sketch a tattoo and anyone may use inks later on to alter a tattoo. While a finished tattoo is extracted into a needle, it can be dipped using a set of tattooist's tools into a bottle of ink to absorb the ink and the requisite volume. This completely replaces the visual property of any existing ink used to create or alter the tattoo at an earlier point in time. Each 1-ounce bottle contains enough ink to create one chest or back tattoo, or two face, neck, arm, or leg tattoos.": "纹身师在绘制纹身草图时使用墨水，任何人都可以在以后使用墨水来改变纹身。当一个完成的纹身被提取到针头中时，可以使用一套纹身师的工具将其浸入一瓶墨水中，以吸收墨水和必要的体积。这完全取代了在早期用于创造或改变纹身的任何现有墨水的视觉特性。每瓶1盎司的墨水足以创造一个胸部或背部纹身，或两个面部、颈部、手臂或腿部的纹身。",
	"Common": "普通",
	"Uncommon": "不常见",
	"Very Rare": "非常罕见",
	"Legendary": "传说中的",
	"A chubby dwarf chuckles while applying the last drops of baleful ink onto his hammer, ensuring that his strike inflicts an extra dose of pain upon his unwitting target.": "一个胖乎乎的侏儒一边笑着，一边把最后一滴可恶的墨水涂在他的锤子上，确保他的一击能给不知情的目标带来额外的痛苦。",
	"A deft-fingered gnome finishes her design with a final flourish of golden ink. Concentrating, she lifts the swirls from the page, decorating her fingertips with a few quick strokes.": "一个手指灵巧的地精用金色墨水的最后一笔完成了她的设计。她专心致志地从书页上抬起漩涡，用几笔快速的笔触装饰她的指尖。",
	"The tattoo on the elf's arm began to glimmer as she places a steady hand upon her companion. Playful wisps of arcane energy dances around them, as the tattoo slides slowly from her onto the weary human—bestowing him with the means and magic to bring down the fearsome creature looming above.": "当她把一只稳定的手放在她的同伴身上时，精灵手臂上的纹身开始闪闪发光。俏皮的缕缕奥术能量在他们周围飞舞，当纹身从她身上慢慢滑落到疲惫的人类身上时--赋予他手段和魔法，让他打倒上面隐约可见的可怕的生物。",
	"While her party rests, the tattooist works in the dying campfire light to sketch intricate tattoo designs in hopes of empowering her companions. In the heat of battle, a tattooist manipulates magic and ink to empower attacks, distribute mystical tattoos on the fly, and conceive new designs based on the arcane spellslinging of her opponents.": "当她的队伍休息时，纹身师在即将熄灭的篝火光中画出复杂的纹身图案，希望能给她的同伴带来力量。在激烈的战斗中，纹身师操纵魔法和墨水来增强攻击力，即时分发神秘的纹身，并根据对手的神秘咒语来构思新的设计。",
	"Just as tattooists blur the line between artist and magician, so too can they occupy multiple niches on the battlefield. As keen observers will instantly recognize, tattooists have an uncanny vitality mystically fortified by their craft. Many tattooists do their best fighting on the frontlines, shrugging off some nasty hits in the process. While not as devoted to the practice of magical arts as most spellcasters, their ability to comprehend the intricacies of magic and incorporate the arsenal of others into their own is a formidable and perplexing challenge for their opponents.": "就像纹身师模糊了艺术家和魔术师之间的界限一样，他们也可以在战场上占据多个位置。敏锐的观察者会立即意识到，纹身师有一种不可思议的生命力，通过他们的手艺得到了神秘的强化。许多纹身师在前线做了最好的战斗，在这个过程中甩掉了一些讨厌的打击。虽然没有像大多数施法者那样致力于魔法的实践，但他们理解错综复杂的魔法并将他人的武器库纳入自己的能力，对他们的对手来说是一个可怕的、令人困惑的挑战。",
	"An adventuring party can be sure that a tattooist in their midst will do their utmost to carry their weight. As they struggle and persevere with the group, the selection of magic tattoos that tattooists are able to understand and produce expands in tandem.": "一个冒险队伍可以确信，他们中间的纹身师会尽最大努力来承担他们的重量。随着他们与队伍的斗争和坚持，纹身师能够理解和制作的魔法纹身的选择也在同步扩大。",
	"Tattooists will often strive to improve themselves and their craft in different ways. Some may seek apprenticeship under proven virtuosos. Others may be aware of their genius and push forward on their own towards discoveries that change their profession in unfathomable ways. Ultimately, however, most tattooists are devoted to fashioning designs that can move the hearts and minds of others with both their beauty and their magical potential.": "纹身师往往会以不同的方式努力提高自己和自己的技艺。有些人可能会在公认的大师手下寻求学徒。其他人可能意识到自己的天才，并以自己的方式推动发现，以深不可测的方式改变他们的职业。然而，最终，大多数纹身师都致力于塑造设计，以其美丽和神奇的潜力打动他人的心和思想。",
	"As you create a tattooist, it is essential to consider the path you took and what compels your character to move forward. Are you self-taught, or did you have a legendary mentor? What sort of style have you adopted and how does this influence you beyond your artwork? What sets you apart from your peers?": "当你创造一个纹身师时，必须考虑你所走的道路，以及是什么迫使你的性格向前发展。你是自学成才，还是有一个传奇的导师？你采用了什么样的风格，这在你的艺术作品之外如何影响你？是什么让你从同龄人中脱颖而出？",
	"Perhaps you were begrudgingly mentored by a skilled tattooist, who imparted to you knowledge that would have confounded a less capable apprentice. Maybe you were looking for a way to remain an artist while still braving the dangers that exist around every corner of this world. Or conceivably, you wish to journey to enrich your work, all the while building up your list of future clientele.": "也许你被一个熟练的纹身师勉强指导过，他传授给你的知识会让一个能力较差的学徒感到困惑。也许你正在寻找一种方法，在保持艺术家身份的同时，仍然勇敢地应对这个世界每个角落存在的危险。或者可以想象，你希望通过旅行来丰富你的工作，同时建立起你未来的客户名单。",
	"You can make a tattooist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background Acolyte|PHB} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名纹身师。首先，让宪法成为你的最高能力得分，其次是灵巧。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing, here's what you need to know if you choose the tattooist as one of your classes.": "如果你的团体使用了关于多类的可选规则，那么如果你选择纹身师作为你的一个类别，你需要知道以下内容。",
	"{@b {@i Ability Score Minimum.}} As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Constitution score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a tattooist.": "{@b {@i Ability Score Minimum.}}作为一个多类人物，你必须有至少13分的体质分才能在这个类别中取得一个等级，如果你已经是一个纹身师，则在其他类别中取得一个等级。",
	"{@b {@i Proficiencies Gained.}} If the tattooist isn't your initial class, you gain the following proficiencies when you take your first level as a tattooist: light armor, painter's supplies, and tattooist's tools.": "{@b {@i Proficiencies Gained.}}如果纹身师不是你的初始等级，当你作为纹身师的第一级时，你会获得以下熟练度：轻甲，画家用品，以及纹身师的工具。",
	"{@b {@i Spellcasting.}} Add half your levels (rounded up) in the tattooist class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. The number of spellbangers you apply on your body (as well as their spell level) remains tied to your individual level in the tattooist class.": "{@b {@i Spellcasting.}}将你的纹身师等级的一半（四舍五入）与其他等级的相应等级相加，以确定你的可用法术槽。你在身上施加的咒语数量（以及它们的法术等级）仍然与你在纹身师等级中的个人等级有关。",
	"Your list of learned spells that can be turned into spellbangers as a tattooist are completely separate from the spells you know and are able to prepare from other classes.": "你作为纹身师所学到的可以变成法术的法术清单与你所知道的、能够从其他类别中准备的法术完全分开。",
	"You can not create spellbangers for spells other than the two you obtain at the first level as a tattooist, and spells successfully observed using your Sketchy Imitation feature.": "除了你作为纹身师在第一层获得的两个法术，以及用你的素描模仿功能成功观察到的法术外，你不能为其他法术创造咒语。",
	"You also can't use spell slots to cast the two spells you learn to convert into spellbangers at the first level as a tattooist, or spells successfully observed using your Sketchy Imitation feature. If the spell is also a spell you know and can prepare because it is associated with another one of your classes, you use either your spell slots or your applied spellbangers to cast that spell (they are not the same resource).": "你也不能使用法术槽来施放你在作为纹身师的第一级学习转换为法术的两个法术，或者使用你的素描模仿功能成功观察到的法术。如果这个法术也是你所知道并能准备的法术，因为它与你的另一个等级有关，你就用你的法术槽或你的应用法术师来施放这个法术（它们不是同一资源）。",
	"Once in a blue moon, fortunate tattooists might be struck by what can only described as \"divine inspiration\". These individuals often report receiving repeated flashes of creative visions while engaged in a variety of different situations. Whether they are struck while dreaming in bed, or as they are engaged in mortal combat, the end result remains the same. True divine inspiration allows a tattooist to bring a divine tattoo into existence—a full-body suit (full-body tattoo) mimicking the abilities of the powerful deity it represents.": "幸运的纹身者可能会被只能被描述为 \"神圣的灵感 \"所震撼。这些人经常报告说，他们在各种不同的情况下收到了反复闪现的创造性幻觉。无论他们是在床上做梦时被击中，还是在进行致命的战斗时被击中，最终的结果都是一样的。真正的神圣灵感使纹身师能够带来一个神圣的纹身--全身套装（全身纹身），模仿它所代表的强大神灵的能力。",
	"A divine tattoo is often an artist's most breathtaking work. It can also be looked at as the prime example of a tattooist's technical mastery over their craft. An aficionado might notice the impossibly complex magical pathways weaved within the tattoo, purposefully laid within the simplest strokes and inconspicuous curves forming the foundation of the design.": "神圣的纹身往往是艺术家最令人惊叹的作品。它也可以被看作是纹身师对其工艺的技术掌握的主要例子。一个爱好者可能会注意到在纹身中编织的不可能的复杂的魔法路径，有目的地在最简单的笔触和不显眼的曲线中形成设计的基础。",
	"A tattooist might describe the experience of conceiving a divine tattoo as akin to channeling the very will of a deity. Every line, every curve of the design, is representative of different aspects of the being's power.": "纹身师可能将构思神圣纹身的经验描述为类似于引导神灵的意志。设计的每一条线，每一条曲线，都代表着神的力量的不同方面。",
	"A divine tattoo is inherently very powerful and exceedingly rare. Even the most distinguished tattooists would only realistically be able to craft one such masterpiece in their lifetime. A great deal of artists will abandon the task altogether, after recognizing that the quest to acquire the necessary materials can often be impossible for a regular individual.": "神圣的纹身本质上是非常强大的，而且极其罕见。即使是最杰出的纹身师，在现实中也只能在他们的一生中制作一个这样的杰作。很多艺术家在认识到获取必要的材料对一个普通人来说往往是不可能的之后，会完全放弃这项任务。",
	"Those interested in procuring a divine tattoo would naturally want to talk to the sitting tattooists at any and all tattoo parlors they come across. The creations won't simply be found on display at a storefront, where they can easily be shoplifted.": "那些对购买神圣纹身感兴趣的人，自然希望与他们遇到的任何和所有纹身店的现任纹身师交谈。这些作品不会被简单地陈列在店面里，因为它们很容易被偷窃。",
	"A tattooist may be willing to part with their masterpiece in exchange for a hefty (often ludicrous) price, a magical item or items of equal or greater value (in their eyes), an undesirable task (which they certainly cannot handle themselves), or a variety of other equally challenging demands. In all these scenarios, you should consider that you are likely asking for a tattooist's most prized possession. It will not be easy.": "纹身师可能愿意放弃他们的杰作，以换取高昂的（通常是可笑的）价格、一件或多件（在他们眼中）具有同等或更大价值的神奇物品、一项不受欢迎的任务（他们肯定无法自己处理），或其他各种同样具有挑战性的要求。在所有这些情况下，你应该考虑到，你很可能要求获得纹身师最珍贵的财产。这将是不容易的。",
	"An even greater challenge awaits those who are fortunate enough to secure a divine tattoo. Due to the sheer power they hold, attuning to a legendary full-body suit actually makes it impossible for an individual to attune to more than one other magic item. Some have said this is a manifestation of divinity's pride—and that would be an astute observation. An experienced tattooist would also add that a mortal body was never meant to bear a tattoo created to embody the gods themselves.": "一个更大的挑战在等待着那些有幸获得神性纹身的人。由于它们所拥有的巨大力量，对一件传奇的全身套装进行调谐实际上使一个人不可能调谐到一个以上的其他魔法物品。有人说这是神性的骄傲的表现--这将是一个精明的观察。有经验的纹身师也会补充说，凡人的身体本来就不应该承受为体现神灵本身而创造的纹身。",
	"A selection of unique spells that are referenced by some of the magic tattoos found within the pages of this book.": "本书中的一些魔法纹身所引用的独特咒语的精选。",
	"{@b Humperdink the Warlock} has been crafting spells to imbue into new magic tattoos. If you want to check out his shop, use your Quantum Reader to scan this teleportation tattoo:": "{@b Humperdink the Warlock}一直在制作法术，以灌输到新的魔法纹身中。如果你想看看他的商店，用你的量子阅读器扫描这个传送纹身。",

	"You can make a tattooist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background acolyte} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名纹身师。首先，让宪法成为你的最高能力得分，其次是灵巧。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"As a mystical tattoo artist, you have an {@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT} that you can use to create spellbangers. Spellbangers are the smallest type of magic tattoos, easily fitting upon your fingertips. They only require a few minutes of focus to sketch during a long rest. The application process for spellbangers is similar to the application process for magic tattoos, requiring spare needles and tattooist's tools in hand.": "作为一个神秘的纹身艺术家，你有一个{@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT}，你可以用它来创造咒语者。咒语者是最小的魔法纹身类型，很容易在你的指尖上找到。它们只需要在长时间的休息中集中几分钟的时间来勾画。施法者的申请过程与魔法纹身的申请过程相似，需要备用针头和纹身师的工具在手。",
	"Casting a spell using a spellbanger is akin to casting a spell from an item, so you must take an action, bonus action, or reaction (depending on the original spell's casting time) to produce its spell's effects, but you may do so without material components. If the spell requires a material component with a cost, you must have that specific component before you can cast the spell using a spellbanger. If the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate.": "使用施法者施法类似于用物品施法，所以你必须采取行动、额外行动或反应（取决于原始法术的施法时间）来产生其法术效果，但你可以在没有材料组件的情况下这样做。如果该咒语需要一个有代价的物质成分，你必须在使用咒语者施放该咒语之前拥有该特定的成分。如果该法术需要集中注意力，你必须集中注意力。",
	"Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since the spellbangers are fueled by the magical energy that naturally courses through your body, as blood flows through your veins.": "体质是你施法的能力，因为施法者是以自然流经你身体的魔法能量为燃料的，就像血液流经你的血管一样。",
	"At 1st level, you've learned how to observe spells in the heat of battle and conceive spellbanger designs to recreate the effects of those spells.": "一级时，你已经学会了如何在激烈的战斗中观察法术，并构思出法术师的设计来重塑这些法术的效果。",
	"As a reaction when a creature (other than you) that you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell from the Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard spell list, you can make an ability check using your tattooist spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, you can sketch a spellbanger representing that spell during a long rest within the next month. If you do not sketch the spellbanger within the allotted time, you must observe the spell being cast again. Once you have sketched a particular spellbanger, you may sketch it without needing to observe the spell again.": "作为反应，当你能看到的60英尺范围内的生物（除你之外）从吟游诗人、巫师、术士或魔法师的法术列表中施放一个法术时，你可以使用你的纹身师法术能力进行能力检查。能力值等于10+法术的等级。如果成功，你可以在下个月的长时间休息中画出一个代表该法术的咒语。如果你没有在规定的时间内画出咒语者，你必须再次观察该咒语的施展。一旦你画出了某个特定的咒语者，你就可以画出它，而不需要再去观察这个咒语。",
	"The Tattooist table shows whether or not you can apply the spellbanger.": "纹身师表显示你是否可以应用咒语者。",
	"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能的次数等于你的体质修正值（最少一次）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得任何已消耗的使用次数。",
	"At 1st level, you have an empty {@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT}. Your enchanted sketchbook acts as a repository for the spellbangers you sketch. Tattooists will only need to devote a single page of their sketchbook for sketching and accumulating spellbangers.": "1级时，你有一个空的（%0%）。你被施了魔法的素描本可以作为你素描的咒语者的储存库。纹身师只需要在他们的素描本中拿出一页来画素描和积累咒语者。",
	"At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spellbanger designs of your choice from any arcane caster class spell lists (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard). The Tattooist table shows how many applied spellbangers of each spell level your body can sustain at your current tattooist level.": "在1级时，你会从任何奥术施法者等级的法术列表（吟游诗人、巫师、术士或魔法师）中选择两个1级的咒语设计。纹身师表显示了在你当前的纹身师等级下，你的身体可以承受多少个每个法术等级的应用咒语者。",
	"Each spellbanger is designed for a specific spell and can only be utilized to cast that spell at its lowest level. Once the spell is cast, the spellbanger vanishes from your skin. You can expend multiple spellbangers of the same design, to incrementally increase the spells level for that casting.": "每个施法者都是为一个特定的法术而设计的，并且只能用来施展该法术的最低等级。一旦施法完毕，施法者就会从你的皮肤上消失。你可以使用多个相同设计的施法者，以逐步提高该次施法的法术等级。",
	"For instance, if you have two spellbangers for {@spell burning hands|PHB} (a 1st-level spell), you can cast the spell on two separate occasions at 1st level or expend both tattoos to cast the spell at 2nd level. Unlike other tattoos that you create, spellbangers function in part thanks to your lived experience informing the magic imbued within their design. Tattooing a spellbanger on another creature does not grant them the ability to cast the spell. Once you have utilized all the applied spellbangers for a particular spell, they cannot be cast again in this way until reapplied. You can remove and apply as many spellbangers as your body can sustain during a long rest.": "例如，如果你有两个{@spell burning hands|PHB}（一个1级法术）的spellbangers，你可以在1级时分两次施放该法术，或者在2级时消耗两个纹身来施放该法术。与你创造的其他纹身不同，咒语者的功能部分归功于你的生活经验为其设计中注入的魔法。在另一个生物身上纹上咒语者并不赋予他们施法的能力。一旦你为某个特定的咒语使用了所有的施法者，它们就不能再以这种方式施放，除非重新施放。在长时间的休息中，你可以移除和应用你的身体所能承受的咒印，数量不限。",
	"Applied directly onto the surface your skin, spellbangers are in the optimal place to draw freely from the magical energy coursing throughout your body. You therefore use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for any spell you cast using a spellbanger and when making an attack roll with one.": "直接涂抹在你的皮肤表面，施法者处于最佳位置，可以自由地汲取流经你全身的魔法能量。因此，每当咒语提到你的施法能力时，你就会使用你的体质。此外，在为你使用施法者施展的任何法术设定蓄力DC时，以及在用施法者进行攻击时，你都会使用你的体质修改器。",
	"The spellbangers you sketch in your enchanted sketchbook are a unique variant of the main branch of magic tattoos you can create. As you gain levels, you also gain more experience with the fascinating manner in which magic flows through all things in the multiverse. This allows you to find imaginative ways to manipulate the flow of magic on a smaller scale through your arcane designs. Your expertise inevitably allows you to better comprehend the tattoos created by others as well, whether discovered on the back of a traveling mercenary or a legendary deity.": "你在魔法素描本中勾画的咒语者是你可以创造的魔法纹身的主要分支的独特变体。随着你等级的提高，你也获得了更多关于魔法在多元宇宙所有事物中流动的迷人方式的经验。这使你能够找到富有想象力的方法，通过你的神秘设计在更小的范围内操纵魔法的流动。你的专业知识不可避免地使你能够更好地理解他人创造的纹身，无论是在旅行的佣兵还是传奇的神灵背上发现的。",
	"Your sketchbook will often end up a mess of inksplotched parchment and scribbles. A sketchbook can come in many forms, sometimes as a pile of parchment clipped onto a flat plank of wood, or at other times just a hastily bound pile of sketches. Every tattooist's precious sketchbook is unique, each page treated with a generous amount of magical energy.": "你的素描本最后往往会变成一堆涂满墨水的羊皮纸和潦草的文字。素描本可以有多种形式，有时是一叠夹在平坦木板上的羊皮纸，有时只是一叠匆匆装订的草图。每个纹身师的珍贵素描本都是独一无二的，每一页都经过了大量的魔法能量处理。",
	"If you wanted to make a backup copy of your sketchbook, it is a relatively easy process. After all, the designs of your spellbangers and magic tattoos are fixed in your mind. However, spellbangers and magic tattoos can not be preserved on just any regular page.": "如果你想给你的素描本做一个备份，这是个相对容易的过程。毕竟，你的咒语者和魔法纹身的设计已经固定在你的脑海中。然而，咒语者和魔法纹身不能只保存在任何普通的页面上。",
	"In order to create an enchanted sketchbook, you must spend some time alone to focus and enchant a new sketchbook, treating each page with the magics which allow your designs to flourish and be preserved within its pages. The new sketchbook must have a minimum of one page and must be bound together in some manner if there is more than one page in the stack. The amount of time you need is 5 minutes per page, which can be broken up into multiple sessions should you require more time. This is light activity.": "为了制作一本施了魔法的素描本，你必须花一些时间独自关注并给一本新的素描本施魔法，用魔法处理每一页，让你的设计在书页中蓬勃发展并被保存下来。新的素描本必须至少有一页，如果有多于一页的书，必须以某种方式装订在一起。你需要的时间是每页5分钟，如果你需要更多的时间，可以分成多次进行。这是轻度活动。",
	"If you wish, you can also find enchanted sketchbooks for sale at any tattoo parlor.": "如果你愿意，你也可以在任何一家纹身店找到魔法素描本出售。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you've gained the ability to sketch magic tattoos.": "从2级开始，你已经获得了勾画魔法纹身的能力。",
	"When you gain this feature, you are able to pick four magic tattoo designs with a rarity of common to learn. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace two of the magic tattoo designs you learned, with two new ones.": "当你获得这个特性时，你能够挑选四个稀有度为普通的魔法纹身图案来学习。当你在这个等级中获得一个级别时，你可以用两个新的魔法纹身图案取代你所学的两个图案。",
	"Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can use 1 hour as light activity to sketch one of your known magic tattoo designs into your enchanted sketchbook. A creature can attune to the magic tattoo immediately after you complete the sketch, provided you conduct a quick application before the long rest ends. If you or another creature decides to attune to the magic tattoo later, you must undergo the usual process for attunement.": "每当你进行短期或长期休息时，你可以用1小时作为轻度活动，在你的魔法素描本上画出一个你已知的魔法纹身图案。一个生物可以在你完成草图后立即与魔法纹身相合，只要你在长休结束前进行快速应用。如果你或其他生物决定以后再适应这个魔法纹身，你必须经过通常的适应过程。",
	"A magic tattoo retains its properties and remains a magic item indefinitely. This remains true even if the original tattooist dies.": "魔法纹身会保留其属性，并无限期地保持为魔法物品。即使最初的纹身师死了，也是如此。",
	"A character requesting a tattoo or a tattooist sketching a tattoo must have the appropriate materials to do so. There always needs to be a formula in place for creating a magic tattoo.": "要求纹身的人物或绘制纹身草图的纹身师必须有相应的材料才能做到。创造一个神奇的纹身总是需要有一个公式。",
	"The {@item enduring fortitude tattoo|ToMT} can be used as an example. This was a tattoo designed to help an individual resist disease, poison, and the effects of alcohol.": "{@item enduring fortitude tattoo|ToMT}可以作为一个例子。这是一个纹身，旨在帮助个人抵抗疾病、毒药和酒精的影响。",
	"While ink and a capable tattooist are necessary in tattoo creation, so too are the constituent material components. These materials are similar to the components necessary for crafting other, equally-potent magic items. For a magic tattoo like the enduring fortitude tattoo, the requisite materials can range from the poisonous mandibles of a fearsome creature to a bottle of exquisite alcohol only produced in a distant land (or both). The necessary components are all magically broken down and mixed in with the ink before a tattooist even begins sketching a magic tattoo.": "虽然墨水和有能力的纹身师在纹身创作中是必要的，但构成材料的成分也是如此。这些材料与制作其他同样强大的魔法物品所需的成分类似。对于像持久毅力纹身这样的魔法纹身来说，必要的材料可以是可怕的生物的有毒下颚，也可以是一瓶只在遥远的地方生产的精致酒精（或者两者都是）。在纹身师开始绘制魔法纹身的草图之前，必要的成分都被神奇地分解并与墨水混合在一起。",
	"The suggested challenge rating of a creature for a party to face in pursuit of material components is included in the Suggested CR for Exotic Material Gathering table. Most material components necessary for this process can also be found at tattoo parlors (though stock can fluctuate wildly between establishments). The cost of crafting components for magic tattoos is around half the average price provided on the Magic Tattoos Price Guide table depending on the tattoo's rarity.": "为追求材料成分而面对的生物的建议挑战等级包括在异国材料收集的建议CR表中。这个过程所需的大部分材料成分也可以在纹身店中找到（不过各家店的存货会有很大的波动）。制作魔法纹身的部件的成本大约是魔法纹身价格指南表上提供的平均价格的一半，这取决于纹身的稀有程度。",
	"There will be times during your journey where you discover a magic tattoo, perhaps applied on a creature or sketched upon another tattooist's sketchbook page, that you wish to make your own.": "在你的旅程中，有时你会发现一个神奇的纹身，也许是应用在一个生物上，或者是在另一个纹身师的素描本上勾勒出来的，你希望能成为自己的纹身。",
	"If the tattoo you wish to copy into your enchanted sketchbook is of a rarity you are able to sketch, the process requires direct vision of the magic tattoo for 1 hour and all the necessary material components.": "如果你想复制到你的魔法素描本中的纹身是你能够素描的珍品，这个过程需要直接看到魔法纹身1小时和所有必要的材料成分。",
	"If the tattoo you wish to copy into your enchanted sketchbook is of a rarity you are not yet able to sketch, the process requires direct vision of the magic tattoo for 3 hours and all the necessary material components. After the process, you must make an ability check using your tattooist spellcasting ability. The DC equals 15 + 2 per level of rarity above the highest level of rarity you are currently able to sketch. For instance, if you wish to copy a magic tattoo with a rarity of very rare but are only able to learn magic tattoo designs with a rarity of common, then the DC is 21. On a success, you are able to copy the magic tattoo. On a fail, you are unable to copy the magic tattoo and the material components you used for the process are wasted.": "如果你想复制到你的魔法素描本中的纹身是你还不能素描的稀有品种，这个过程需要直接看到魔法纹身3小时，以及所有必要的材料成分。在这个过程之后，你必须使用你的纹身师法术能力进行能力检查。DC等于15+每一级稀有度的2，高于你目前能够画出的最高稀有度的等级。例如，如果你想复制一个稀有度很高的魔法纹身，但只能学习稀有度为普通的魔法纹身设计，那么DC是21。如果成功，你就能复制魔法纹身。如果失败，你将无法复制魔法纹身，并且你在这个过程中使用的材料成分也会被浪费掉。",
	"Your copied magic tattoo designs do not count towards your total learned magic tattoo designs, and copied magic tattoo designs do not remain fixed in your mind for sketching again later.": "你复制的魔法纹身图案不计入你所学的魔法纹身图案总数中，而且复制的魔法纹身图案也不会固定在你的脑海中，以便以后再次勾勒。",
	"At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a tattooist style of your choice. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.": "在3级时，你深入研究你所选择的一种纹身师风格的高级技术。你的选择在5级时赋予你特性，在9级和15级时再次赋予你特性。",
	"At 3rd level, you have learned how to apply defective magical ink onto weapons. To use this ability, you must have tattooist's tools in hand. You can use a bonus action to unload and apply charges of Bad Ink onto the weapon of a willing creature within 5 feet of you.": "在3级的时候，你已经学会了如何将有缺陷的魔法墨水涂抹在武器上。要使用这个能力，你必须有纹身师的工具在手。你可以使用一个额外的动作来卸下并在你5英尺范围内自愿的生物的武器上涂抹不良墨水。",
	"On the next hit using that weapon, it does an additional {@dice 1d6} acid damage per charge applied and the ink vanishes. If you don't hit a target with the inked weapon within the next hour, the Bad Ink fades away. You have a number of charges equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "在下一次使用该武器击中目标时，每应用一次电荷会造成额外的{@dice 1d6}酸性伤害，并且墨水会消失。如果你在接下来的一小时内没有用带墨的武器击中目标，坏墨就会消失。你拥有与你的体质修饰值相等的充电次数（最少一次）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得任何已消耗的使用次数。",
	"The additional damage die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a {@dice d8} at 5th level, a {@dice d10} at 10th level, and a {@dice d12} at 15th level.": "当你在这个等级中达到一定级别时，额外的伤害模子会发生变化。该模子在5级时变成{@dice d8}，10级时变成{@dice d10}，15级时变成{@dice d12}。",
	"When you reach 4th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.": "当你达到四级时，你可以将你选择的一项能力得分提高2分，或者你可以将你选择的两项能力得分提高1分，和通常一样，你不能用这个功能将能力得分提高到20分以上。",
	"If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.": "如果你的DM允许使用特技，你可以改用特技。",
	"At 5th level, you gain a feature granted by your Tattooist Style.": "在5级时，你获得一个由你的纹身师风格赋予的功能。",
	"At 6th level, you are able to pick three magic tattoo designs with a rarity of uncommon to learn. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace two of the magic tattoo designs you learned, with two new ones.": "在6级的时候，你能够挑选三个稀有度为不常见的魔法纹身图案来学习。当你在这个等级中获得一个级别时，你可以用两个新的魔法纹身图案取代你所学的两个图案。",
	"At 7th level, you've learned how to manipulate magic tattoos in unusual ways. With tattooist's tools in hand, you can use an action to magically transfer one of your magic tattoos from yourself onto one willing creature within 5 feet of you that has an available attunement slot. The creature may use that magic tattoo as if they were attuned to it. This exchange is reversed after a short or long rest, at which point the transferred magic tattoo disappears from the creature's skin and reappears on yours.": "在第七级时，你已经学会了如何以不寻常的方式操纵魔法纹身。手持纹身师的工具，你可以使用一个动作，将你的一个魔法纹身从自己身上神奇地转移到你周围5英尺内一个有可用调谐槽的自愿生物身上。该生物可以使用那个魔法纹身，就像他们被调和到它一样。这种交换在短暂或长时间的休息后会被逆转，此时转移的魔法纹身会从该生物的皮肤上消失，并重新出现在你的皮肤上。",
	"A creature can only benefit from Art Loan from one tattooist at a time.": "一个生物一次只能从一个纹身师的艺术贷款中受益。",
	"When you reach 8th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.": "当你达到8级时，你可以将你选择的一项能力得分提高2分，或者你可以将你选择的两项能力得分提高1分，和平常一样，你不能用这个功能将能力得分提高到20分以上。",
	"At 9th level, you gain a feature granted by your Tattooist Style.": "9级时，你获得一个由你的纹身师风格赋予的特性。",
	"When you reach the 10th level, you have gained an astute understanding of magic tattoo application. While you use at least three attunement slots to attune to magic tattoos, you can attune to one more magic tattoo without requiring an attunement slot. If fewer than three of your attunement slots are used to attune to magic tattoos, you lose this bonus attunement.": "当你达到10级时，你已经对魔法纹身的应用有了敏锐的认识。当你使用至少三个调和槽来调和魔法纹身时，你可以再调和一个魔法纹身而不需要调和槽。如果你使用的调谐槽少于三个，你就会失去这个额外的调谐。",
	"At 11th level, your skill for manipulation of mystical tattoos has deepened immensely. You gain additional properties for certain class features.": "在11级时，你操纵神秘纹身的技能得到了极大的深化。你为某些等级特征获得了额外的属性。",
	"During a long rest, you can now apply one spellbanger of {@filter 6th|spells|level=6|class=Tattooist (ToMT)} or {@filter 7th|spells|level=7|class=Tattooist (ToMT)} level.": "在长期休息期间，你现在可以应用一个{@filter 6th|spells|level=6|class=Tattooist (ToMT)}或{@filter 7th|spells|level=7|class=Tattooist (ToMT)}等级的法术宝典。",
	"When you use Art Loan, you also retain a copy of the magic tattoo you transfer to your ally. The transferred tattoo still disappears from the target's skin after a short or long rest.": "当你使用艺术贷款时，你也会保留一份你转移给盟友的魔法纹身的副本。转移的纹身在短期或长期休息后仍然会从目标的皮肤上消失。",
	"When you reach 12th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.": "当你达到12级时，你可以将你选择的一项能力得分提高2分，或者你可以将你选择的两项能力得分提高1分，和平常一样，你不能用这个功能将能力得分提高到20分以上。",
