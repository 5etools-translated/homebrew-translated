	"This clear glue can dissolve almost any mundane adhesive. One dose of the solvent can cover a 1-foot square surface.

If dissolved into container holding more than 10 gallons, the substance has no effect.": "一小撮这些微小的晶体就能溶解在高达10加仑的液体容器中。1分钟后，该溶液会清除沾染液体的任何毒物或疾病。这对本身是毒药的液体或已经被毒药或疾病影响的生物没有效果。如果溶解在盛放10加仑以上的容器中，该物质就没有效果。",
	"A dose of this liquid, if splashed out of a flask, can ruin light vegetation and undergrowth (but not trees) in up to 4 patches, each about five feet square.

	"Eggshell Grenade, Pepper. This grenade, when it strikes the face (or near the sensory organs of a creature), bursts into a cloud of noxious, stinging chemicals. Because the grenade must be targeted so precisely, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. If you hit, the target must succeed in a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated.

	"One round after lighting this device, a chemical reaction propels a missile from its containing tube. The rocket shoots forward up to 100 feet, where it bursts in a brilliant flare accompanied by a bang audible within 300 feet. Rockets are typically fired into the air to create a signal visible at a great distance. Each is manufactured to flare with a specific color for this purpose. A rocket can instead be used as an improvised weapon with a range of 100 feet.
