	"Published on r/UnearthedArcana & feyrunelabs.com on October 23, 2017": "2017年10月23日发表于r/UnearthedArcana & feyrunelabs.com",
	"The existence of this document is predicated on the feeling that not all gunslingers must be fighters. Just as there is room in D&D for all classes to wield a sword (some better than others, granted), so too should all classes have an option that deals with guns.": "这份文件的存在是基于这样一种感觉：并非所有的枪手都必须是战士。就像在D&D中，所有等级都有挥舞剑的空间（当然，有些等级比其他等级更好），所以所有等级也应该有一个处理枪支的选项。",
	"We must first credit the magnificent Matthew Mercer for his Gunslinger archetype, which is an excellent piece of work. We haven't included a Fighter archetype here because we didn't think we could do better. And just as he took inspiration from Pathfinder, we take inspiration from him, and some of our archetypes share a feature or two with the Gunslinger (primarily the simple proficiencies with firearms and {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB}). Some features have also been inspired by or adapted from Pathfinder archetypes.": "我们必须首先归功于伟大的Matthew Mercer，他的枪手原型是一个优秀的作品。我们在这里没有包括战士原型，因为我们认为我们无法做得更好。正如他从《探路者》中获得的灵感一样，我们也从他那里获得了灵感，我们的一些原型与枪手共享一两个特征（主要是对枪械和（%0%）的简单熟练度）。一些特征也受到了《开拓者》原型的启发或改编。",
	"Each archetype has its own theme, and not every ability deals explicitly with firearms. Some are more weapon-focused than others, and others have their own twists.": "每个原型都有自己的主题，并不是每个能力都明确涉及到枪械。有些人比其他的人更注重武器，而其他的人则有他们自己的扭曲。",
	"In a world where firearms are more common, questions of their creation and maintenance inevitably arise, particularly among players who are anxious to tinker with their weapons. Thus, also included is an expanded list of firearms and rulesets for crafting both firearms and ammunition.": "在一个枪支更加普遍的世界里，不可避免地会出现关于枪支制造和维护的问题，特别是在那些急于修补武器的玩家中。因此，也包括一个扩大的枪支清单和制作枪支和弹药的规则集。",
	"We're not shy in admitting that what initially drew us to create this codex was a wild west vibe, as one of us is running a campaign in such a setting. But setting isn't baked too deeply into the rules (more on that below), so you could take a campaign many different directions while still including firearms.": "我们并不羞于承认，最初吸引我们创建这个法典的原因是西部荒野的氛围，因为我们中的一个人正在运行这样一个背景下的战役。但是设定并没有深入到规则中去（下面会有更多介绍），所以你可以在包括枪械在内的情况下，将战役推向许多不同的方向。",
	"As just a few examples:": "仅举几个例子。",
	"There's the Van Helsing feel, where guns are the specialized tools of the wealthy or truly dangerous. That, of course, may or may not be...": "有一种范海辛的感觉，在那里枪支是富人或真正危险的人的专门工具。当然，这可能是也可能不是......",
	"Steampunk. Industry, Victorian culture, and steam are the driving forces, and guns are a natural fit.": "蒸汽朋克。工业、维多利亚文化和蒸汽是驱动力，而枪支则是自然而然的。",
	"The Dishonored feel, of video game fame, with whale oil and supernatural dystopian overtones.": "视频游戏中有名的Dishonored感觉，带有鲸鱼油和超自然的二元论色彩。",
	"The historical approach, where technology advances more slowly and spreads more slowly.": "历史的方法，技术进步更慢，传播更慢。",
	"Cowboys!": "牛仔们!",
	"Pirates!": "海盗!",
	"And, of course, combinations of these and many more that spring from the inventive minds of DMs. The point is simply to say that the inclusion of guns in your campaign doesn't define in which genre you can play—it implies a level of technology, true, but even that has plenty of wiggle room. Enjoy pondering the possibilities!": "当然，还有这些的组合，以及更多来自DMs的创造性思维的组合。重点只是说，在你的活动中加入枪支并不意味着你可以玩哪种类型的游戏--它意味着一个技术水平，没错，但即使是这样也有很多回旋的余地。请尽情思考各种可能性吧。",
	"First off: yes, guns are powerful. Basic guns are on par with longbows and heavy crossbows, while more advanced guns outstrip any weapons in the Player's Handbook. This is by design. Depending on how you chose to integrate firearms into your campaign, this might have one of two effects: firearms may be rare and coveted tools (much like magic items), or firearms are common enough that enemies and PCs both possess them and balance each other out.": "首先：是的，枪支很强大。基本枪支与长弓和重弩相当，而更高级的枪支则超过了《玩家手册》中的任何武器。这是设计上的问题。根据你选择如何将枪支融入你的战役，这可能会产生两种效果之一：枪支可能是罕见的、令人垂涎的工具（很像魔法物品），或者枪支足够普遍，以至于敌人和NPC都拥有它们，并相互平衡。",
	"If a few player characters carry firearms, especially advanced or enchanted variants, the CR of your encounters will certainly be affected. If the encounter involves NPCs with weapons, one simple solution is to give them guns as well. This may make fights a bit faster and more brutal, but that's a historically accurate side effect of introducing guns into warfare. For DMs wanting to restrict the proliferation of firearms, simply using higher CR foes or giving the same ones more hit points should suffice.": "如果一些玩家角色携带枪支，特别是高级或附魔的变体，你的遭遇战的CR肯定会受到影响。如果遭遇战涉及携带武器的NPC，一个简单的解决方案就是给他们也配备枪支。这可能会使战斗变得更快、更残酷，但这是在战争中引入枪支的一个符合历史的副作用。对于想限制枪支扩散的管理员来说，只需使用较高CR的敌人或给同样的敌人更多的命中率就足够了。",
	"As was touched on above, firearms can easily fit into many different settings, whether that's vibes of 15th century Italy, 18th century Mexico, steampunk, or something entirely different. Mechanically, though, there's probably only two things that will change about firearms in these different environments: scarcity and level of technology.": "正如上面提到的，枪支可以很容易地融入许多不同的环境，无论是15世纪的意大利、18世纪的墨西哥、蒸汽朋克，还是完全不同的东西。不过，从机制上讲，在这些不同的环境中，枪械可能只有两点会发生变化：稀缺性和技术水平。",
	"For those wanting to implement firearms as they were in the early medieval period, it may be best to limit those available to basic or perhaps moderate complexity (see gear listings). Guns would probably be rare and expensive, and ammunition hard to find—the simplest adjustment is perhaps to double the listed prices of basic guns, triple those of moderate complexity, and so on. Characters in such settings might have to (or want to) do more of their own crafting to offset this rarity.": "对于那些想要实现中世纪早期的枪支的人来说，最好是把那些可用的枪支限制在基本的或者是中等复杂程度的（见装备列表）。枪支可能会很稀有和昂贵，弹药也很难找到--最简单的调整可能是将基本枪支的价格提高一倍，将中等复杂程度的枪支提高三倍，以此类推。在这样的环境中，角色可能不得不（或想要）自己做更多的手工，以抵消这种稀有性。",
	"Inversely, characters in worlds where firearms are common face a different problem: staying alive. Guns, particularly more advanced varieties, pack a heavy punch, and player characters will probably want to have a healer, stock up on potions, or just boost their Armor Class to increase their survivability.": "相反，在枪支普遍存在的世界中，角色面临着一个不同的问题：保持生命。枪支，尤其是更先进的枪支，具有很强的冲击力，玩家角色可能希望有一个治疗师，储存药水，或只是提高他们的护甲等级，以增加他们的生存能力。",
	"The firearms presented here possess a few properties and rules different from those presented in the Dungeon Master's Guide or other sources. All material presented in The Gunpowder Codex assumes use of these mechanics.": "这里介绍的火器拥有一些不同于《地下城管理指南》或其他资料中的属性和规则。火药法典》中介绍的所有材料都假定使用了这些机制。",
	"Characters proficient in martial weapons are automatically proficient in {@b martial firearms}. These firearms are a common sight in most settings, and many different characters learn to use them. {@b Advanced firearms}, however, require more specialized training that may be acquired either through the Advanced Gunner feat, one of the archetypes presented in the following pages, or by fulfilling some other requirement established by the DM.": "精通武术武器的角色会自动精通（%0%）。这些枪械在大多数环境中都是常见的，许多不同的角色都会学习使用它们。然而，{@b Advanced firearms}需要更专业的训练，可以通过高级枪手特技、下面几页中介绍的原型之一，或者通过满足DM制定的其他要求来获得。",
	"As with bows or crossbows, all firearms require ammunition to make an attack. If using the simple rules, this ammunition all takes the form of bullets; if using gritty rules, ammunition might be musketballs, cartridges, or buckshot (see the Crafting Ammunition section below). Regardless of ruleset, crafting ammunition requires use of @item {Tinker's Tools|PHB}, although merchants in locations where firearms are more common often sell ammunition as well.": "与弓或弩一样，所有火器都需要弹药来进行攻击。如果使用简单的规则，这种弹药都是以子弹的形式出现的；如果使用狡猾的规则，弹药可能是火枪弹、弹壳或弹头（见下面的制作弹药部分）。不管是哪种规则，制作弹药都需要使用@item {Tinker's Tools|PHB}，尽管在枪支比较普遍的地方，商人也经常出售弹药。",
	"In most settings, firearms are a new technology, and even those practiced in their use have to work around a few unique limitations, as detailed below. For the purposes of rules text, firearms count as both ranged weapons and firearms, and are eligible for abilities that include ranged weapon attacks.": "在大多数环境中，火器是一种新的技术，即使是那些精通火器的人也必须绕过一些独特的限制，详见下文。就规则文本而言，火器既算作远程武器也算作火器，并且有资格使用包括远程武器攻击的能力。",
	"A firearm may be shot a number of times equal to its Reload score before it must be reloaded by using either an action or a bonus action. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm—although you could use your free action to stow a weapon in your other hand before reloading.": "在必须使用行动或额外行动重新装弹之前，枪械可以被射击的次数与它的重新装弹分数相等。你必须有一只自由的手来给枪械装弹--尽管你可以在装弹前用你的自由行动把武器放在另一只手上。",
	"If you are using Matthew Mercer's Gunslinger archetype with the Gunpowder Codex (which we recommend), you may notice that these reload rules are slightly different than those he presents. Our feeling is that the use of a single attack to reload should be the fastest possible reload time, and should be swapped with the ability to reload as a bonus action in the Lightning Reload ability.": "如果你使用Matthew Mercer的枪手原型与火药法典（我们推荐），你可能会注意到这些重装规则与他提出的略有不同。我们的感觉是，使用单次攻击来装填应该是最快的装填时间，并且应该与闪电装填能力中的装填作为奖励动作的能力对换。",
	"Furthermore, fighters have very little use for bonus actions, and this change can greatly aid their action economy. DMs may choose to leave Gunslinger as is, of course, and doing so won't upset anything presented here—although it could potentially cause confusion at the table if the gunslinger is using different firearms rules than other characters. Ultimately, that choice is up to the DM.": "此外，战士们很少使用奖励行动，而这种改变可以极大地帮助他们的行动经济。当然，管理员可以选择让枪手保持原样，这样做不会破坏这里的任何内容--尽管如果枪手使用的枪械规则与其他角色不同，有可能会在桌子上造成混乱。归根结底，这个选择取决于管理员。",
	"Whenever you roll an attack roll with a firearm and the result on the die is equal to or lower than a firearm's Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the firearm is in danger of breaking completely. You may spend an action to clear the misfire (no check required), but if you do not, a second misfire will cause an explosion and break the weapon. This explosion deals the weapon's listed damage to you and any creatures or objects within five feet. Clearing a misfire out of combat similarly requires no check. Repairing a broken firearm, however, requires one hour and an Intelligence-based check with {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB} (DC 10 + the firearm's misfire score). On a success, the weapon is repaired and functional again; failure simply means you must spend another hour to attempt the repairs again.": "每当你用火器掷出一个攻击卷，并且骰子的结果等于或低于火器的失火分数，武器就会失火。攻击失败，枪械有完全损坏的危险。你可以花一个行动来清除失火（不需要检查），但如果你不这样做，第二次失火将导致爆炸并使武器破裂。这次爆炸会对你和五英尺内的任何生物或物体造成武器所列举的伤害。在战斗中清除失火同样不需要检查。然而，修复一个坏掉的枪支需要一个小时和一个基于智力的检查，检查内容为（%0%）（DC 10+枪支的失火分数）。如果成功，武器就会被修复并重新发挥作用；失败意味着你必须再花一个小时来尝试修复。",
	"When you fire a weapon with the scatter property at a target, you may simultaneously attack a second target that is within 5 feet of the first. Use the same attack and damage rolls for both targets.": "当你向一个目标发射带有散射属性的武器时，你可以同时攻击在第一个目标5英尺内的第二个目标。对两个目标使用相同的攻击和伤害卷。",
	"Weapons with the burst property have two additional attack options. The wielder may fire five pieces of ammunition in one attack in order to grant advantage on their attack roll. Alternately, they may use their action to fire fifteen pieces of ammunition and attack up to four targets, none of which can be more than five feet from another. Make separate attack rolls for each target, but only roll damage once for all targets.": "具有爆裂属性的武器有两个额外的攻击选项。持枪者可以在一次攻击中发射五枚弹药，以便在他们的攻击卷上获得优势。或者，他们可以使用他们的行动来发射15枚弹药，并攻击最多4个目标，其中任何一个都不能超过5英尺。对每个目标进行单独的攻击卷，但对所有目标只卷一次伤害。",
	"Weapons with the covert property grant advantage on checks made to conceal the weapon—whether on your person, under or in an object, or somewhere else. The DM has the final say on whether or not this property applies to a situation.": "具有隐蔽属性的武器在检查隐藏武器时具有优势--不管是在你身上，还是在物体下面或里面，还是在其他地方。对于这种属性是否适用于某种情况，DM有最终决定权。",
	"While some players may be familiar with some or all of the items listed on the tables below, each is described briefly here for clarity and those less familiar.": "虽然有些玩家可能对以下表格中列出的部分或全部项目都很熟悉，但为了让不太熟悉的人更清楚，这里对每个项目都做了简单的描述。",
	"{@b Bayonet.} A bayonet is a knife, spike, or similar piece of metal designed to fit on the muzzle of a firearm. Its purpose is to serve as a last resort melee weapon in instances where taking the time to switch weapons is impractical or impossible. Usage of a bayonet is important in determining its damage—if attached to a one-handed weapon, it may only use the listed one-handed damage. If attached to a two-handed firearm, it can be used as a versatile weapon. If used on its own, unattached to a firearm, a bayonet uses the statistics of a dagger.": "{@b Bayonet.}刺刀是一把刀，钉子，或类似的金属片，设计在枪支的枪口上。它的目的是作为最后的近战武器，在花时间切换武器是不切实际或不可能的情况下。刺刀的使用对确定其伤害很重要--如果连接在单手武器上，它只能使用列出的单手伤害。如果附在双手武器上，它可以作为一种多功能的武器使用。如果单独使用，不与枪械相连，刺刀使用匕首的统计数据。",
	"{@b Arquebus.} The most basic combination of barrel, stock, and trigger, arquebuses use actual burning matches to set off their powder charge. This makes them cumbersome to use and load, but also cheap to produce, and therefore quite common.": "{@b Arquebus.}最基本的枪管、枪托和扳机的组合，箭筒使用实际燃烧的火柴来引爆火药。这使得它们在使用和装填时很麻烦，但生产成本也很低，因此相当普遍。",
	"{@b Flintlock Pistol.} The first kind of pistol that didn't require using an actual match, these are muzzle-loading, single-shot pistols. They are simple to build and perhaps the most common firearm around.": "{@b Flintlock Pistol.}第一种不需要使用实际火柴的手枪，这些都是枪口装弹，单发的手枪。它们制造简单，也许是周围最常见的火器。",
	"{@b Musket.} A step up from an arquebus, a musket is a flintlock weapon that uses steel on flint to set off the powder. It is still slow to load, but has slightly better range, packs more of a punch, and weighs less.": "{@b Musket.}火枪是箭杆枪的升级版，是一种燧发枪，使用钢制的火石来引爆火药。它的装填速度仍然很慢，但射程稍好，冲击力更大，而且重量更轻。",
	"{@b Pocket Pistol.} A gentleman's weapon, pocket pistols are basic flintlock weapons designed to be easily hidden. They are, however, notably unreliable and short range.": "{@b Pocket Pistol.}作为一种绅士的武器，袖珍手枪是基本的燧发枪，设计上很容易隐藏。然而，它们明显不可靠，而且射程很短。",
	"{@b Scattergun.} Scatterguns are similar to muskets in that they are muzzle-loaded and must be reloaded after each shot. They are similarly flintlock weapons, but instead of a single ball they fire buckshot—a grouping of tiny pellets that spread out over a wide area.": "{@b Scattergun.}散弹枪与火枪类似，都是枪口装弹，每次射击后必须重新装弹。它们也是类似于燧发枪的武器，但它们发射的不是单一的弹丸，而是散弹--一组微小的弹丸，散布在大范围内。",
	"{@b Double Hunting Rifle.} A hunting rifle with two barrels, one stacked atop the other.": "{@b Double Hunting Rifle.}有两个枪管的猎枪，一个堆放在另一个上面。",
	"{@b Gatling Gun.} A large, lever-cranked weapon that can be fired rapidly, gatling guns are usually mounted on wagons or carried via complicated leather harnesses. They are exceedingly intricate and expensive to build, making them rare finds in most locations.": "{@b Gatling Gun.}一种可以快速发射的大型杠杆式武器，加特林枪通常安装在马车上，或通过复杂的皮绳携带。它们制造起来非常复杂和昂贵，因此在大多数地方都很难找到。",
	"{@b Harmonica Gun.} A harmonica gun is breech-loaded with a steel slide, containing a number of chambers bored in it which are filled with cartridges. As you fire each shot, you push the slide through a bit to line up the next cartridge. An intricate design, these are rare sights in most areas.": "{@b Harmonica Gun.}口琴枪是用钢制滑道后膛装弹的，里面有许多钻孔的枪膛，里面装满了弹壳。当你发射每一发子弹时，你将滑道推过一点，以排入下一个弹匣。这是一种复杂的设计，在大多数地区都是罕见的景象。",
	"{@b Howdah Pistol.} Designed specifically for killing large game, howdah pistols are large-caliber handguns that pack a wallop. They are breech-loaded but single-shot, trading capacity for power.": "{@b Howdah Pistol.} 豪达手枪是专门为猎杀大型猎物而设计的，是大口径的手枪，具有震撼力。它们是后膛枪，但却是单发的，以容量换取威力。",
	"{@b Hunting Rifle.} More sophisticated than a musket, a hunting rifle is a breech-loader and fires cartridges. Its long range makes it popular with hunters and marksmen, although they are not as common or cheap as muskets or arquebuses.": "{@b Hunting Rifle.}比火枪更复杂，猎枪是一种后膛装弹器，可以发射子弹。它的远射程使它受到猎人和射手的欢迎，尽管它们不像火枪或箭步枪那样常见或便宜。",
	"{@b Lever-Action Rifle.} The rare product of master gunsmiths, lever-action rifles keep extra rounds in a tubular magazine under the barrel, and each new cartridge is loaded by using the lever that's part of the trigger guard. They are intricate and difficult to build, making them prized possessions of those lucky enough to own one.": "{@b Lever-Action Rifle.}作为枪械大师的稀有产品，杠杆式步枪将多余的子弹放在枪管下的管状弹仓中，每一个新的子弹都是通过使用扳机护圈中的杠杆装入的。它们复杂而难以制造，使它们成为那些有幸拥有的人的珍贵财产。",
	"{@b Pepperbox.} The simplest method to fire multiple shots without reloading is to have more barrels, as a pepperbox does. All four barrels rotate together to line up the next barrel with the hammer.": "{@b Pepperbox.}在不重新装弹的情况下进行多次射击的最简单方法是拥有更多的枪管，就像胡椒盒那样。所有四个枪管一起旋转，使下一个枪管与击锤对齐。",
	"{@b Pistol.} A slight upgrade from the flintlock, the pistol has two barrels stacked on top of each other and is more reliable. They are a common sight with guards and soldiers in some places.": "{@b Pistol.}比燧发枪稍有升级，这种手枪有两个枪管叠在一起，更加可靠。在一些地方，它们是卫兵和士兵的常见装备。",
	"{@b Revolver.} Considered by many the pinnacle of handguns, revolvers use rotating chambers with a single barrel. They are reliable, easier to clean and reload, and can fire six times before reloading. Their mechanical complexity, however, can sometimes make them difficult to find or afford.": "{@b Revolver.}被许多人认为是手枪的顶峰，左轮手枪使用旋转枪膛，只有一个枪管。它们很可靠，更容易清洗和重新装弹，而且在重新装弹之前可以发射六次。然而，它们的机械复杂性有时会使它们难以找到或买不起。",
	"{@b Shotgun.} An upgrade from scatterguns, shotguns have two barrels, are breach-loaded, and are set off by a hammer instead of a flint. They are additionally more reliable and hit harder, and this extra bit of craftsmanship generally makes them more expensive as well.": "{@b Shotgun.} 霰弹枪是散弹枪的升级版，它有两个枪管，可以突破性装弹，由锤子而不是火石引爆。此外，它们更可靠，打击力度更大，而这种额外的工艺通常也使它们更昂贵。",
	"{@b Sniper Rifle.} Sniper rifles are essentially hunting rifles that have been machined to a higher degree of precision and quality. This results in better range, damage, but also more weight and skill to craft, and they can often be very difficult to find.": "{@b Sniper Rifle.} 狙击步枪本质上是狩猎步枪，已经被加工成更高的精度和质量。这导致了更好的射程和伤害，但也有更多的重量和技能来制作，而且他们往往是非常难以找到。",
	"{@b Sniper Rifle, Revolver.} Even rarer than its single-shot brother, the revolver sniper rifle operates on the same principles, but carries four cartridges in revolving chambers, allowing for faster follow-up shots and less time spent reloading.": "{@b Sniper Rifle, Revolver.}比起它的单发兄弟，左轮狙击步枪甚至更罕见，它的操作原理相同，但在旋转的枪膛中携带四个弹夹，允许更快的后续射击，并减少重新装弹的时间。",
	"{@b Bomb.} A bomb is a unadorned sphere of thin iron designed to disintegrate when the powder inside it detonates. As an action, you may place the bomb on the ground or throw it up to 20 feet. Bombs do not go off immediately, instead exploding at the beginning of your next turn. Anyone within a 5-foot radius of the bomb when it detonates takes 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful DC 13 Dexterity save.": "{@b Bomb.} 炸弹是一个没有任何装饰的薄铁球，当里面的火药引爆时就会解体。作为一个动作，你可以把炸弹放在地上，或者把它扔到20英尺以外。炸弹不会立即爆炸，而是在你下一个回合开始时爆炸。炸弹爆炸时，半径5英尺范围内的任何人都会受到2d6的火焰伤害和2d6的穿刺伤害，或者在成功进行DC13灵巧救赎后受到一半的伤害。",
	"{@b Buckshot.} A package of small lead pellets that scatter when fired, doing damage to creatures in a large area.": "{@b Buckshot.} 一包小的铅弹，发射后会散开，对大范围内的生物造成伤害。",
	"{@b Cartridges.} A bullet and dose of powder are combined within a package of stiff, chemically treated paper to form a cartridge. The paper and powder burn away when fired, sending the bullet forward on its own. If your group is using the rules for simple ammunition crafting, the terms cartridge and bullet may be used interchangeably, and you should use the statistics for cartridges for bullets.": "{@b Cartridges.} 一颗子弹和一定剂量的火药结合在一包坚硬的、经过化学处理的纸上，形成一个弹壳。发射时，纸和火药烧掉，使子弹自行向前。如果你的小组使用的是简单的弹药制作规则，那么弹壳和子弹这两个词可以互换使用，你应该把弹壳的统计数据用于子弹。",
	"{@b Concussive Cartridge (Alchemical).} Concussive cartridges deal an additional 2d6 thunder damage when they hit a target. Like explosive cartridges, they are volatile and prone to failure—the Misfire score of a firearm is temporarily raised by 2 for a shot made using an concussive cartridge. Such ammunition cannot usually be bought from merchants, and must be handmade.": "{@b Concussive Cartridge (Alchemical).} 震荡弹在击中目标后会造成额外的2D6雷霆伤害。和爆炸弹一样，它们也是不稳定的，而且容易失败--使用震荡弹射击时，枪支的失火分数会暂时提高2分。这种弹药通常不能从商人那里买到，必须是手工制作的。",
	"{@b Explosive Cartridge (Alchemical).} For important shots or simply more firepower, explosive cartridges deal an additional 2d6 fire damage when they hit a target. Their volatility, however, makes them prone to failure—the Misfire score of a firearm is temporarily raised by 2 for a shot made using an explosive cartridge. Such ammunition cannot usually be bought from merchants, and must be handmade.": "{@b Explosive Cartridge (Alchemical).}对于重要的射击或更多的火力，爆炸弹在击中目标时能造成额外的2d6火力伤害。然而，它们的挥发性使它们容易失败--使用爆炸性弹夹射击时，火器的失火分数会暂时提高2分。这种弹药通常不能从商人那里买到，必须是手工制作的。",
	"{@b Gunpowder Horn.} Often hung on a leather strap for easy portability, a gunpowder horn holds up to 100 doses of gunpowder. Groups using the rules for simple ammunition crafting do not need to worry about gunpowder.": "{@b Gunpowder Horn.}为了便于携带，火药角通常挂在皮绳上，可容纳100剂量的火药。使用简单弹药制作规则的团体不需要担心火药问题。",
	"{@b Gunpowder Keg.} Less portable than a horn, a gunpowder keg holds up to 1000 doses of gunpowder and is often transported via horse or wagon. Groups using the rules for simple ammunition crafting do not need to worry about gunpowder.": "{@b Gunpowder Keg.}火药桶比号角更不容易携带，它可以容纳1000剂量的火药，通常通过马匹或马车运输。使用简单弹药制作规则的团体不需要担心火药问题。",
	"{@b Musketballs.} A simple ball of lead, paired with a dose of black powder when loaded into a firearm. Although the ball and powder are technically two separate items, they're mechanically treated as one for the sake of simplicity.": "{@b Musketballs.}一个简单的铅球，在装入枪支时与一剂黑火药配对。虽然从技术上讲，铅球和火药是两个独立的物品，但为了简单起见，它们在机械上被视为一个整体。",
	"The effort and cost of creating a firearm from scratch is directly proportional to its complexity. More complicated guns require special components and experimentation to get right.

During a short rest, the number you craft is simply equal to the result of your check.
