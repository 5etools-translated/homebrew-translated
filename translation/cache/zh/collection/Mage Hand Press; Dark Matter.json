	"A monster with thermalsight can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog. The monster can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, the monster can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. Many constructs have this special sense.": "拥有热视力的怪物可以通过黑暗和严重遮蔽的条件（如雾）看到生物。该怪物还可以通过其体温来判断一个生物是活还是死。然而，怪物不能辨别颜色，也不能用这种感觉看穿幻象、隐形或魔法黑暗。这种感觉会被一英寸的任何固体障碍物所阻挡。许多结构体都有这种特殊的感觉。",
	"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.": "这个在黑暗物质中的新技能决定了一个人能够多好地操纵技术界面并获得信息或其他功能。你的智力（数据）检查包含了你对软件及其利用的知识，而不是硬件（硬件由技术技能涵盖），所以只有在你使用有界面的技术时才会用到，比如数据板、奥术终端、飞船的计算机，或者其他控制技术，比如门控或控制（%0%）或飞船武器的计算机。如果一项技术没有接口，则需要一个接口设备来与之互动。当你试图对一个数据系统进行复杂的操作时，当你试图对一个构造物进行重新编程时，或者当你试图入侵一个设备时，GM应该要求进行智力（数据）检查。",
	"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called Hacking and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account.": "任何一种非法或未经授权进入技术系统的行为都被称为黑客行为，需要使用（%0%），以及智力（数据）检查。一般来说，一个黑客尝试需要使用技术进行1分钟的工作，尽管GM可以决定某些任务可能只需要一个行动。在黑客检查成功后，你可以在系统上进行操作，就像你有完全的权限一样。如果检查失败，就掷一个D6。如果是6，设备就会被锁住，不能再尝试入侵它。更安全的设备可能会在掷出5或6时锁定，或在掷出4至6时锁定，由GM决定。你可以入侵设备，非法进入安全系统，打开一扇门，解除警报，或者操纵别人的数据包，让你获得他们的信息或银行账户。",
	"A new skill in Dark Matter, your Dexterity (Piloting) check covers how well you maintain control over a ship in difficult circumstances. You don't need proficiency in Piloting to fly a ship (be it an aircraft or a spacecraft), but proficiency in this skill can help when you need to make a crash landing or pull off a risky maneuver in a dogfight. The GM might call for a Dexterity (Piloting) check when you attempt to fly a ship through an electromagnetic storm that disrupts the controls, or when you wish to perform a hard stop or pull a high-G turn.": "作为《黑暗物质》的一项新技能，你的灵巧（驾驶）检查涵盖了你在困难情况下对飞船的控制能力。你不需要熟练掌握驾驶技能来驾驶飞船（无论是飞机还是航天器），但是当你需要进行迫降或者在斗狗中进行危险的操作时，熟练掌握这项技能会有所帮助。当你试图驾驶飞船通过破坏控制的电磁风暴时，或者当你希望进行硬停或高G转弯时，GM可能会要求你进行灵巧（驾驶）检查。",
	"Your Intelligence (Technology) check measures your ability to understand the inner workings of technological devices. Most devices are powered by some form of magic, but plenty of intricate design goes into channeling that magic into useful effects. Use this skill to understand unfamiliar or complex technology or to modify or repair devices. The GM may call for an Intelligence (Technology) check when you attempt to modify a blaster, repair your ship's {@item shield generator|darkmatter}, disable a rogue android, or sabotage an arcane terminal.": "你的智力（技术）检查衡量你了解技术设备内部运作的能力。大多数设备都是由某种形式的魔法驱动的，但大量复杂的设计都是为了将魔法转化为有用的效果。使用这个技能来了解不熟悉的或复杂的技术，或者修改或修理设备。当你试图改造一个爆破器，修理你的飞船（%0%），禁用一个流氓机器人，或破坏一个奥术终端时，GM可能会要求你进行智力（技术）检查。",

It's infamous for its heft, recoil, and stopping- power, and it is favored by gunslingers that accept no compromises.": "这种令人印象深刻的手枪，以其创造者马格努斯-奥普姆命名，重量几乎是连发枪的两倍。它因其重量、后坐力和阻止力而臭名昭著，受到不接受妥协的枪手们的青睐。",

	"The nodes mounted on this helmet's dome emit an invisible psionic field, amplified by the mind of anyone who wears it. By focusing on the helm and extending a hand, the user can even direct the field into a blast of psionic force.": "安装在这个头盔圆顶上的节点会发出一个无形的幻象场，被任何戴着它的人的思想所放大。通过集中注意力在头盔上并伸出一只手，使用者甚至可以将该领域引导为幻觉力量的爆炸。",
	"You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Dexterity, for this weapon's attack rolls.": "你可以使用你选择的智力、智慧或魅力，而不是灵巧，用于该武器的攻击卷。",
	"The Revolving Exothermic Cannon (or REC gun, for short) operates on the same principle as a conventional blaster, with an arcane battery hooked up to an aperture barrel and so forth, but mounts several blasters on a revolving cylinder, each firing in rapid succession.": "旋转式放热炮（简称REC炮）的工作原理与传统爆破器相同，将奥术电池与光圈炮管等连接起来，但在一个旋转的圆筒上安装了几个爆破器，每个都是快速连续发射。",
	"Less a blaster in the conventional sense, and more a stripped-down Dark Matter engine designed to rip a contained hole in the universe, the singularity emitter is a singularly destructive weapon. After being fired, however, the weapon must cool down, venting exceptional amounts of heat to maintain a stable Dark Matter core.": "与其说是传统意义上的爆破器，不如说是一个精简的暗物质引擎，旨在在宇宙中撕开一个封闭的洞，奇点发射器是一种独特的破坏性武器。然而，在发射之后，该武器必须冷却下来，释放出大量的热量以维持稳定的暗物质核心。",
	"When this weapon hits a target, each creature within 10 feet of the target is pulled up to 5 feet toward it.": "当此武器击中目标时，目标10英尺内的每个生物都会被拉向它，最多 5英尺。",
	"The flame-throwing volcanic consists of a set of tanks and a hefty arcane battery arranged into a backpack, connected by a hose to the gun. The gun itself is essentially a nozzle and trigger for the weapon's volatile incendiary spray, which chars any organic target in seconds.": "火焰喷射器由一组坦克和一个巨大的奥术电池组成，排列在一个背包里，通过软管与枪连接。枪本身基本上是一个喷嘴和触发器，用于武器的挥发性燃烧物喷射，可以在几秒钟内烧毁任何有机目标。",
	"Whenever you make an attack with this weapon, it spews flames in a 15-foot radius cone. Each creature within that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage.": "每当你用这个武器进行攻击时，它就会在一个15英尺半径的圆锥体中喷出火焰。该区域内的每个生物都必须做一个DC14的灵巧蓄力动作，否则会受到2D6的火焰伤害。",
	"Favored by assassins and infiltrators, the antimatter dagger produces a short blade of crackling energy. With some skill, this weapon can be hidden up a sleeve, stashed in a belt, or secreted away in a hidden compartment, to be revealed at the right moment for a precision kill.": "反物质匕首受到刺客和潜入者的青睐，它能产生噼里啪啦能量的短刃。通过一些技巧，这种武器可以藏在袖子里，藏在腰带上，或者藏在一个隐蔽的隔间里，在适当的时候露出来，进行精确的杀戮。",

On a strike, the gloves magnify kinetic energy at the knuckles and issue a deafening crack.": "这些手套的特点是在手掌上有一个圆柱形的抓手，可以加强拳头的力量，并给安装在指关节上的一组雷电电池充电。在击打时，手套会在指关节处放大动能，并发出震耳欲聋的裂纹。",
	"When activated, these gloves project dazzling, razor-sharp claws from the fingertips, which can be used to shred a foe to ribbons.": "激活后，这些手套会从指尖投射出令人眼花缭乱的锋利的爪子，可以用来将敌人撕成碎片。",

	"A mechanical, articulating gauntlet, this weapon slips over a hand and mimics its movements. A battlefist can deliver crushing blows on its own, but is usually paired with another weapon, such as a blaster, to be employed when enemies draw too near. This weapon is especially favored by the vect, who can integrate one in place of a hand to ensure a weapon is always nearby.": "这种武器是一种机械的、可铰接的铠甲，它可以滑到手上并模仿其动作。战拳可以单独提供粉碎性打击，但通常与另一种武器配对，如爆破枪，以便在敌人过于接近时使用。这种武器尤其受到中士的青睐，他们可以用它来代替一只手，以确保武器始终在附近。",
	"This weapon acts as an oversized, articulated gauntlet. It can hold and manipulate objects, though you can't attack with your battlefist while you're holding an object with it.": "这种武器就像一个超大的、有关节的护手。它可以握住并操纵物体，不过当你用它握住物体时，你不能用战拳进行攻击。",
	"The strange, two-foot long rod wielded by wrothians is composed of a glistening, exotic crystal which pulls against an underlying field in the universe. Moving it around reveals a strange resistance, as any speed, an invisible wave of force extends feet from the rod, bashing any obstacles in front of it.": "wrothians挥舞的奇怪的两英尺长的棒子是由一种闪闪发光的异国水晶组成的，它与宇宙中的一个潜在的场拉扯。在周围移动它时，会发现一种奇怪的阻力，因为任何速度，一种无形的力量波都会从棒子上延伸出来，撞击它前面的任何障碍。",
	"This laser sword of shorter hilt and half-blade length is normally wielded in pairs, making a light complement for deft two-weapon fighters.": "这种激光剑的剑柄较短，半刃长，通常是成对挥舞，为灵巧的双兵器战士提供轻盈的补充。",
	"An elegant weapon, for a more enlightened age, the laser sword consists of a metal hilt which projects a fixed-length laser when activated. Its weightless blade makes for an agile, deadly weapon capable of cutting through many materials. The sword could even stop a blaster bolt, but alas, one would need precognition and superhuman reflexes to do so.": "激光剑是一种优雅的武器，适用于更开明的时代，它由一个金属剑柄组成，激活后会发射出固定长度的激光。它没有重量的剑身使其成为一种灵活、致命的武器，能够切割许多材料。这把剑甚至可以阻止爆破弹，但可惜的是，人们需要预知能力和超人的反应来做到这一点。",
	"Depending on this weapon's construction, it can deal force, necrotic, or radiant damage. Once the weapon is created, this damage type doesn't change.": "根据这个武器的构造，它可以造成力量、坏死或辐射伤害。一旦武器被制造出来，这种伤害类型就不会改变。",
	"A wicked weapon favored by the elves, the photonic lash produces a bright tendril of energy from its metal hilt. The lash leaves painful, burning lacerations on its victims, along with lasting scars—a tell-tale sign that one has defied the whims of the high elves.": "光子鞭是精灵们喜欢的邪恶武器，它的金属柄上会产生明亮的能量卷轴。鞭子会在受害者身上留下痛苦、灼热的裂痕，以及持久的疤痕--这是一个人违抗高等精灵奇想的明显标志。",
	"Few things are as intimidating as a plasma cutter's circular, white-hot blade. When used in normal operation to carve up high-density metal plates, it can easily remove careless fingers or limbs, but if wielded with lethal intent, it can cleanly dissect someone from end to end.": "很少有东西能像等离子切割机的圆形白热刀片那样令人生畏。当在正常操作中用来雕刻高密度金属板时，它可以轻易地切除粗心的手指或肢体，但如果带着致命的意图挥舞，它可以干净地将一个人从头到尾解剖。",
	"This weapon ignores the damage threshold of nonmagical objects that it cuts.": "该武器无视它所切割的非魔法物体的伤害阈值。",
	"Similar to a battlefist, but larger in scale, this hulking gauntlet invariably throws its users off-balance. Concealed within it is an arcane battery from a blaster, which the gauntlet channels into the knuckles to augment its blows with layered forcefields.": "与战拳相似，但规模更大，这个巨大的战铠总是能让使用者失去平衡。它里面隐藏着一个来自爆破器的奥术电池，铠甲将其导入指关节，用分层力场增强其打击力。",
	"Only the dwarves would conceive of a weapon so unwieldy as the rocket hammer. As its name implies, it is very much a conventional warhammer with a rocket thruster built into the head to magnify its bludgeoning potential.": "只有矮人会设想出像火箭锤这样笨重的武器。正如它的名字所暗示的那样，它在很大程度上是一把传统的战锤，头部装有火箭推进器，以放大其打击潜力。",
	"Once per turn, when you make an attack with this weapon, you can engage its thrusters to deal an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.": "每回合一次，当你用此武器进行攻击时，你可以启动它的推进器，在命中时造成额外的1d4重击伤害。",
	"When a button on this metal tube is pressed, a persistent, foot-long blue stream of flame erupts from its end, scorching those it touches. Though this tool was fashioned for mining asteroids for precious minerals, it has become a favorite (albeit eccentric) choice of weapon for avia-ra warriors.": "当这个金属管上的按钮被按下时，一股持续的、一英尺长的蓝色火焰流从其末端喷出，烧焦它所接触的人。虽然这个工具是为开采小行星上的珍贵矿物而制造的，但它已成为阿维亚拉战士最喜欢的（尽管是古怪的）武器选择。",
	"Though different models exist, the most common by far is the Wrenchinator 9000, a tool used by starship mechanics the 'verse over. This incredible oversized wrench can fasten bolts, loosen bolts, and clobber people over the head.": "虽然存在不同的型号，但到目前为止，最常见的是Wrenchinator 9000，这是一个由星际飞船机械师使用的工具。这种令人难以置信的超大尺寸扳手可以紧固螺栓、松开螺栓，还可以敲打人的头部。",

	"As a general rule, magic doesn't exist in science fiction. Any spectacular event can be spoiled with a few sentences of technobabble, explaining away the magic answer and replacing it with science. In fact, this is a core tenet of many science fiction franchises, as codified by Arthur C. Clarke's immortal declaration that": "一般来说，科幻小说中不存在魔法。任何壮观的事件都可以用几句技术废话来破坏，解释掉神奇的答案，用科学来取代它。事实上，这是许多科幻小说系列的核心原则，正如阿瑟-克拉克（Arthur C. Clarke）的不朽宣言所规定的那样，即",
	"In other words, magical things can always be dismissed with science.": "换句话说，神奇的东西总是可以用科学来否定的。",
	"When you dive into the universe of Dark Matter, you'll find that quite the inverse is true: magic has become so advanced that it seems like high technology. Those blasters are highly-developed evocation wands, that flying car is using a permanent levitate spell, and traveling faster than the speed of light is simply an advanced application of teleportation magic.": "当你潜入《黑暗物质》的宇宙时，你会发现情况恰恰相反：魔法已经变得如此先进，以至于它看起来像高科技。那些爆破器是高度发达的唤醒魔杖，那辆飞车使用的是永久悬浮法术，而比光速更快的旅行只不过是传送魔法的高级应用。",
	"In Dark Matter, fantasy and science fiction can live side-by-side: the universe is filled to the brim with huge starships, innumerable alien creatures and planets, and all sorts of blasters, jetpacks, and power armor. It's also populated with dragons, demons, giants, and strange alien creatures to be met and slain. Axe-wielding barbarians clad in furs can stand alongside machine-gun toting androids, facing down alien horrors on the deck of a derelict space cruiser; trinket-festooned wizards and power armored space commandos can plot together to take down a dragon that lives in an asteroid made of solid gold; and lute-strumming bards can perform and garner fame in every hive of scum and villainy on the outer rim of the galaxy.": "在《黑暗物质》中，幻想和科幻可以并存：宇宙中充满了巨大的星舰、无数的外星生物和行星，以及各种爆破器、喷气背包和动力装甲。它也充满了龙、恶魔、巨人和奇怪的外星生物，有待于我们去迎接和杀戮。挥舞着斧头的野蛮人身披毛皮，可以和手持机枪的机器人站在一起，在一艘废弃的太空巡洋舰的甲板上面对外星恐怖；戴着饰品的巫师和身穿动力装甲的太空突击队员可以一起策划，打倒住在纯金小行星上的龙；弹着琵琶的吟游诗人可以在银河系外缘的每个人渣和小人窝里表演并获得名声。",
	"At its core, Dark Matter is a love letter to our favorite science fiction franchises, and an acknowledgment that science fiction in general need not be divorced from fantasy. The best sci-fi, from Star Wars to Dune, is filled with fantastic elements: mystical space-wizards, laser swords, precognition, and unusual alien abilities, to name a few. None of them seem all that out of place in high fantasy, yet the two are irreparably divorced. Of course, the distinction is mostly an aesthetic one—sci-fi outfits its magic in sleek metal, whereas high fantasy uses glowing arcane runes. Dark Matter is our attempt to bridge that gap.": "黑暗物质》的核心是一封写给我们最喜爱的科幻小说系列的情书，也是对科幻小说一般不需要脱离幻想的承认。最好的科幻作品，从《星球大战》到《沙丘》，都充满了神奇的元素：神秘的太空巫师、激光剑、预知能力和不寻常的外星人能力，仅举几例。这些元素在高级幻想中似乎都没有什么不合适的地方，但这两者却有着不可弥补的分离。当然，这种区别主要是审美上的区别，科幻小说用光滑的金属装备其魔法，而高级幻想小说则使用发光的奥术符文。黑暗物质》是我们弥补这一差距的尝试。",
	"Somewhere out there in the Dark Matter universe, every conceivable world—from the medieval domains of wizards and dragons to the high-tech alien planets of your favorite sci-fi franchise—waits to be discovered. Your own campaign world is out there, too, perhaps blissfully unaware that alien starships dogfight high above, exchanging blaster fire for the fate of the galaxy.": "在黑暗物质宇宙的某个地方，每一个可以想象的世界--从中世纪的巫师和龙的领域到你最喜欢的科幻特许经营中的高科技外星星球--都在等待被发现。你自己的战役世界也在那里，也许你不知道外星战舰在高空交火，为了银河系的命运而交换高射炮火。",

	"\"What can I say? You've got a good arm there.\"": "\"我能说什么呢？你有一个好的手臂。\"",

	"Rami knew that this small prison, tucked away in the bowels of the Solar Citadel, held only two types of prisoners: immensely powerful criminals apprehended by the Sepulcher Knights, and dumb thugs like this one, who tried one too many times to escape their previous jail. Moreover, one of the few things that might prompt an intervention from the bird-headed would be the death of a prisoner. She would have to tread lightly; loosing the full force of her power against this fool could spoil her eventual escape, or worse, cost her the map.": "拉米知道，这个隐藏在太阳城中心的小监狱，只关押了两种类型的囚犯：被海贼王骑士团逮捕的无比强大的罪犯，以及像这个人一样的愚蠢的暴徒，他们曾多次试图逃离他们以前的监狱。此外，可能促使鸟头人干预的少数事情之一是囚犯的死亡。她必须轻装上阵；对这个傻瓜失去全部力量可能会破坏她最终的逃跑，或者更糟的是，使她失去地图。",
	"And besides, it was much more fun if they thought they stood a chance. Rami muttered a word and flicked her wrist, summoning a spectral hand to slap him full in the face. \"Bold of you to assume you can.\"": "此外，如果他们认为自己有机会，那就更有趣了。拉米嘀咕了一句，弹了弹手腕，召唤出一只幽灵般的手，给了他一记耳光。\"你大胆地认为你可以。\"",
	"His smirk evaporated. \"Oh, you're real funny, grue, but you sure ain't smart. You even know who the old man is? He's a Scale & Fang elite, they say. Got connections across the 'verse.\"": "他的笑脸消失了。\"哦，你真的很有趣，格鲁伊，但你肯定不聪明。你甚至知道那老头是谁吗？他们说，他是天秤和方块的精英。在整个'诗篇'中都有关系。\"",

	"\"You black-hearted wretch!\" the thug shouted as he threw another clumsy hook.": "\"你这个黑心的小人！\"暴徒一边喊着，一边又扔出一个笨拙的钩子。",
	"A few seconds later, he was sprawled out on the canteen floor and the rest of his gang were preparing to pile in. Clearly the old man had never stopped making friends. Every lowlife in this place seemed to have his back. Rami dug through her memory for a spell which didn't require material components. Invisibility? No, that needs gum arabic. Silent image? Rami doubted her roughspun fatigues would count as fleece. Aha! Sleep might do the trick: Rami reached for a pinch of sand—the Citadel's floor held no shortage of that—and started forming somatic components.": "几秒钟后，他躺在了食堂的地板上，他的其他帮派成员正准备堆在一起。显然，这个老人从未停止过交朋友。这个地方的每一个低等人似乎都在支持他。拉米在她的记忆中挖出了一个不需要物质成分的咒语。隐身术？不，那需要阿拉伯胶。无声影像？拉米怀疑她的粗纺工作服能否算作绒毛。啊哈! 睡觉可能会有效果。拉米伸手拿了一撮沙子--城堡的地板上不乏这样的沙子--然后开始形成体细胞成分。",
	"The faces of Rami's opponents exhibited a mixture of confusion and concern as she enchanted the sand, then a brief flash of horror as the bewitched grains flew towards the corners of their eyes. Within moments, a half-dozen of them had drifted off to sleep and collapsed in a pile. Rami sensed her opening.": "拉米的对手们在她给沙子施魔法时，脸上表现出困惑和担忧，然后在被施了魔法的沙粒飞向他们的眼角时，脸上闪过一丝惊恐。不一会儿，他们中的半打人已经昏昏欲睡，倒在了一堆。拉米感觉到了她的开口。",
	"She darted forward, evading one thug and shoving another back with a gust of magical wind. One managed to hit her with a thrown boot, but the glancing blow didn't slow her dash toward the exit.": "她飞快地向前冲，躲开了一个暴徒，用一阵魔法风把另一个暴徒推了回去。有一个人设法用扔出的靴子打中了她，但这一闪而过的打击并没有减缓她冲向出口的速度。",
	"To her shock, the door swung open and a trio of avia-ra wardens strode in, golden sunstaves ablaze with radiant energy. Wordless, they set about the room, smiting prisoners left and right as if putting down a full-scale riot. Which perhaps it was, in their view; this wasn't the sort of dungeon that usually inspired its inmates to rampage.": "令她震惊的是，门被打开了，三个阿维亚拉看守人大步走了进来，金色的太阳穴燃烧着璀璨的能量。他们无声无息地在房间里走来走去，左冲右突，仿佛在镇压一场全面的暴乱。在他们看来，也许是这样；这不是那种通常会激发囚犯暴动的地牢。",
	"As a brawl developed all around, the grue wizard skirted the edges, keeping out of the way as far as possible and relying on her agility to evade any attacks that came her way. It seemed that no more guards were coming, so if she could just slip past these three, freedom might still be on the cards.": "随着周围的争斗的发展，这个格鲁族巫师绕到了边缘，尽可能地避开，并依靠她的敏捷性来躲避任何向她袭来的攻击。似乎没有更多的守卫会来，所以如果她能溜过这三个人，自由可能仍然在望。",
	"Cursing her lack of gum arabic, Rami drew on all the tricks she'd learned in her many years of thievery. The well-lit canteen left no shadows for her to skulk through, and she could only avoid notice for a scant few seconds before one of the wardens cut off her escape. The other prisoners, armed only with plastic cutlery and futile rage, were quickly subdued, leaving Rami the last one standing, backed into a corner. The coppery smell of the glowing sunstaves filled her nose.": "拉米诅咒自己没有阿拉伯口香糖，她使用了多年来偷窃过程中学到的所有技巧。光线充足的食堂没有给她留下任何阴影，她只能躲避几秒钟，就被一名狱警截住了逃跑的路线。其他囚犯只有塑料餐具和徒劳的愤怒，很快就被制服了，剩下拉米是最后一个站着的人，被逼到了角落。发光的太阳穴的铜臭味充斥着她的鼻子。",
	"\"Come on, feathers,\" she hissed, \"what're you waiting for?\" Though the answer was clear: she could see glittering fire in their beady eyes. They were savoring their petty triumph. Switching gears to plan B—fighting her way out—Rami bared her teeth and began forming somatic components...": "\"来吧，羽毛，\"她嘶吼道，\"你还在等什么？\" 虽然答案很清楚：她可以看到它们炯炯有神的眼睛里闪烁着火焰。他们正在品尝他们的小胜利。转向B计划--争取她的出路--拉米呲牙咧嘴，开始形成体液成分......",
	"To a terrestrial adventurer, the scale of the galaxy can be mind-bending and a bit frightening. It betrays much of what their senses tell them: the land on which they walk is down, the sky is up, the sun goes from east to west. The idea that \"up\" is in all directions, or that there is no constant \"down,\" or that your world is but a speck of the cosmic whole is antithetical to nearly everything they've ever learned. However, for those adventurers who can muster the courage to brave the starry skies, to strike out into the unknown, and to take their first bold steps into the night, untold treasures are there to be had.": "对于一个陆地上的冒险家来说，银河系的规模可能是令人心惊肉跳的，而且有点可怕。它背叛了他们的感官告诉他们的许多东西：他们行走的土地是向下的，天空是向上的，太阳从东到西。\"向上 \"是指所有方向，或者没有恒定的 \"向下\"，或者你的世界只是宇宙整体中的一个小点，这种想法几乎与他们所学到的一切背道而驰。然而，对于那些能够鼓起勇气勇敢面对星空的冒险家来说，向未知领域进军，向黑夜迈出大胆的第一步，就会有数不清的宝藏。",

Facilitating their journeys are the maws, which (in conjunction with their starships) allow them to travel between stars and vast stretches of galaxy by jumping through the Void. From the markets on the maws to the inner workings of their own ships, they'll come across an endless array of magical technology, from the simple blaster to the intricate Dark Matter drive. Equipment in hand, it is on them to find purpose, meaning, and potentially profit in the galaxy; there is a nearly endless amount of adventuring and exploring to be done, a wide variety of races and factions to engage with or work for, and plenty of deadly hazards to avoid.": "银河系是星际旅行者消磨时间的地方，他们在世界之间的虚无空间--\"黑 \"中规划自己的道路。为他们的旅行提供便利的是大嘴，它（与他们的星际飞船一起）允许他们通过跳过虚空在恒星和广阔的星系之间旅行。从大嘴的市场到他们自己飞船的内部结构，他们会遇到无穷无尽的神奇技术，从简单的爆破器到复杂的暗物质驱动。装备到手后，他们就可以在银河系中找到目的、意义和潜在的利润；这里有几乎无穷无尽的冒险和探索，有各种各样的种族和派别可以参与或为之工作，还有很多致命的危险需要避免。",

This featureless, cold, and lifeless vacuum is often referred to by spacers as \"the Black.\" It is truly ubiquitous, for every world in the 'verse floats within it.": "尽管银河系中的恒星、行星和其他天体的数量确实惊人，但它们总共只占银河系体积的不到百分之一。事实上，太空中充满了深不可测的空虚。这种没有特征、冰冷、没有生命的真空常常被太空人称为 \"黑色\"。它确实无处不在，因为 \"诗篇 \"中的每个世界都漂浮在其中。",
	"The massive expanse of the Black is the single greatest challenge to all long-distance space travel. While travel between planets in a single star system is possible for slower vessels, to cross even the shortest stretch of Black between habitable worlds without faster-than-light (FTL) travel takes many human lifetimes (and even a few elven lifetimes). Lack of air, food, water, and light means that life support systems are essential for any interstellar journey, and to find yourself stranded means slow, certain death (assuming a rogue burst of radiation or a stray asteroid doesn't speed up the process). While powerful terrestrial mages can cross a planet with a wave of their hand and a magic word or two, spells of that nature (such as teleport) don't penetrate far into the Black, nor can similar spells that utilize planar travel.": "巨大的黑子是所有长距离太空旅行的最大挑战。虽然对于较慢的船只来说，在单个恒星系统中的行星之间旅行是可能的，但在没有超光速（FTL）旅行的情况下，即使是在最短的黑域之间穿越，也需要许多人类的生命（甚至是几个精灵的生命）。缺少空气、食物、水和光意味着生命支持系统对于任何星际旅行都是必不可少的，而发现自己被搁浅意味着缓慢而肯定的死亡（假设一个无赖的辐射爆发或一颗流散的小行星没有加速这一过程）。虽然强大的陆地法师可以通过挥手和一两个魔法词来穿越一个星球，但这种性质的法术（如传送）并不能深入到黑子里，类似的利用平面旅行的法术也不能。",
	"No obstacle in the Black is as perilous and impassable as {@b Dead Magic Zones}. In these areas, where the magic of the 'verse has worn thin and ripped wholly asunder, no magic functions, including that which powers ships and drives Dark Matter engines. Navigation systems fail, life support fizzles out, and engines go silent. Finding oneself in one of these zones without a nonmagical means of escape is truly a death sentence.": "黑域中没有任何障碍物像{@b Dead Magic Zones}那样危险和无法通过。在这些地区，'诗篇'的魔力已经消磨殆尽，完全被撕裂，没有任何魔力可以发挥作用，包括为船只提供动力和驱动暗物质引擎的魔力。导航系统失灵，生命支持系统消失，引擎也变得沉默。如果发现自己身处这些区域，而又没有非魔法的逃生手段，那真是一个死刑判决。",
	"Though Dead Magic Zones might appear fixed in place on a map, their boundaries are ever-shifting and churning; they warp, grow, shrink, separate, and merge, all seemingly at random. The largest masses of dead magic appear largely static, but only on the scale of lifetimes. Over millennia, through constant, imperceptible motions, they too move across the 'verse, swallowing some worlds and releasing others as they move.": "虽然死亡魔法区在地图上看起来是固定的，但它们的边界是不断变化和翻腾的；它们扭曲、增长、缩小、分离和合并，所有这些似乎都是随机的。最大的死亡魔法群在很大程度上是静止的，但只是在一生中的规模。几千年来，通过不断的、难以察觉的运动，它们也在'诗篇'中移动，在移动中吞噬一些世界，释放其他世界。",
	"Worlds that lie deep within Dead Magic Zones are considered by many to be lost worlds, inaccessible and cut off from the universe. The gnomish homeworld of Nebellion is one such world, and as a result, gnomish tinkers have developed marvels of science that function and power themselves without the use of magic, even achieving Void-based FTL.

An utterly massive star—one which defies all logic in its continued existence—sits in a slow, orbiting dance with an equally large, tidally-locked black hole. While exceptionally little is known about the star itself, the avia-ra (as well as several other groups) claim that it is the holiest site in the 'verse; the avia-ra's holy city, the {@b Solar Citadel}, orbits this very body. Many of their oldest scripts (which contain some of the first written lore in the galaxy) state that at the center of the so-called Sepulcher Star sits the First God, the carver of the maws, the true creator of the stars (and of all creation), the {@b Old Un}.": "坐落在银河系中心的景象引发了超越、疯狂和神圣的十字军东征：伟大的（%0%）。一颗完全巨大的恒星--它的持续存在违背了所有的逻辑--与一个同样大的、被潮汐锁定的黑洞缓慢地在轨道上跳舞。虽然对这颗恒星本身知之甚少，但阿维亚拉人（以及其他几个团体）声称它是 \"诗篇 \"中最神圣的地方；阿维亚拉人的圣城，{@b Solar Citadel}，正是围绕着这颗星体运行。他们许多最古老的手稿（包含银河系中一些最早的书面传说）说，在所谓的墓穴星的中心，坐着第一神，大嘴的雕刻者，星星（和所有创造物）的真正创造者，（%2%）。",
	"Indeed, sophisticated scans have verified that some structure exists in the core of the star: a sepulcher composed of incomprehensibly strong exotic metals that can withstand the perpetual inferno. But this is not the star's only mystery, for the Sepulcher Star is far too massive to be as old as it is; by all rights, it should have burnt out billions of years ago under its own mass. As its orbit closes in on The Core's black hole, it sheds even more mass, and yet continues to survive. Within a few hundred thousand years, however, the star is likely to be consumed by the black hole altogether.": "事实上，复杂的扫描已经验证了这颗恒星的核心存在某种结构：一个由难以理解的强壮的外来金属组成的墓穴，可以抵御永久的地狱之火。但这并不是这颗恒星唯一的谜团，因为墓穴星的质量太大，不可能像现在这样古老；按理说，它应该在几十亿年前就在自己的质量下烧毁了。当它的轨道接近核心的黑洞时，它脱落的质量甚至更多，但仍继续生存。然而，在几十万年内，这颗恒星很可能就会被黑洞完全吞噬。",
	"The fact that the Knights of the Sepulcher, as well as other individuals, can draw magical power through the colossal star also lends some credence to its power. That the Sepulcher Star contains something of immense might is unquestionable, but the nature of what dwells within the star is completely mysterious. Perhaps Old Un is a being of light and creation, retired in its venerable age to rest within the star, or maybe Un is a malicious creature of the Void, or an Old God of the Far Realm, imprisoned within the star until the universe's end. Or perhaps the truth is stranger still; all that is known for certain is that Un is powerful and inexorably ancient.": "墓穴骑士以及其他个人可以通过这颗巨大的星体汲取魔力，这一事实也让人对它的力量有了一定的信心。墓穴之星包含着巨大的力量，这是毋庸置疑的，但居住在这颗星中的东西的性质是完全神秘的。也许 \"老吽 \"是一个光和创造的生命，在其古老的年代里退休，在星体中休息，或者 \"老吽 \"是虚空中的一个恶意生物，或者是远界的一个老神，被囚禁在星体中，直到宇宙的结束。或者真相更奇怪；所有已知的肯定是 \"吽 \"的强大和不可阻挡的古老。",
	"Were it not for the maws, galactic civilization couldn't exist on the grand scale that it currently does. These massive, antediluvian bones are the remnants of some colossal and long-extinct breed of voidbeast, reinforced with ancient machinery and clutching a massive portal into the Void within their jaws (hence the name). These portals are linked to one another in a network, allowing space travelers to perform perfectly-controlled jumps between the maws, crossing the 'verse with ease. No one is completely certain how the maws work, or who originally constructed them, but they have nonetheless become the backbone of galactic trade. Discovering the maws was a catalyst for the rapid expansion and colonization of the galaxy thousands of years ago, and their importance hasn't lessened since. Acting as a rapid transit network for ships, which can cross the galaxy in mere days, the maw stations connect the galactic empires, act as a neutral meeting ground for intrepid travelers, and form the cornerstone of galactic trade. Each maw station is a vibrant, multicultural trade city and spaceport, playing host to creatures of all sizes and shapes from across the 'verse. If something is to be bought or sold (legally or illegally), it is likely to be found on a maw.": "如果没有大嘴，银河系的文明就不可能像现在这样大规模地存在。这些巨大的、超前的骨骼是某种巨大的、早已灭绝的虚空兽的残骸，用古老的机械加固，在它们的嘴里攥着一个进入虚空的巨大门户（因此而得名）。这些门户在一个网络中相互连接，允许太空旅行者在大口之间进行完美控制的跳跃，轻松地穿越'se'。没有人完全确定大嘴的工作原理，也没有人知道最初是谁建造了它们，但它们还是成为银河系贸易的支柱。几千年前，发现巨口是银河系快速扩张和殖民化的催化剂，此后它们的重要性一直没有降低。作为船舶的快速运输网络，马口站可以在短短几天内穿越银河系，它连接着银河系的各个帝国，作为无畏的旅行者的中立会面场所，并形成银河系贸易的基石。每个巨口站都是一个充满活力的、多文化的贸易城市和太空港，接待来自整个宇宙的各种尺寸和形状的生物。如果要买或卖什么东西（合法或非法），很可能会在巨口站找到。",
	"Unlike most outposts in the galaxy, the maws are uniformly neutral. All beings, even those from far-off planes of existence, are welcome to traverse the stations freely, without fear of reprisal. Demons and angels may be found sharing tables in taverns, chaos beasts can be found haggling with contract keepers from the Plane of Law over shipping manifests, and the bitterest of rival races may hammer out treaties between their peoples in the main courts. Maintaining this peace and neutrality are two unique groups: the amoeboids, a caretaker race of vaguely humanoid, translucent oozes native to the maws, and the Order of the Sepulcher, a relatively new organization of peacekeepers. Though the elves were the first humanoid race to discover and use the maws for their intended purpose, their creation and creator are shrouded in mystery. Only a few pieces of that mystery have been uncovered, the most prominent being the amoeboids themselves. Given that they are the only creatures native to the maws, they seem to be tasked with the continued upkeep and maintenance of the stations, and are especially apt to do so. However, the amoeboids' histories contain no record of their origins, or indeed, on the origins of the maws. Galactic Frontier. There is but one exception to the maw network's absolute connectivity: the links to the outermost ring of stations are one-way, allowing transit out to this outer-edge of the galaxy, but not back. Moreover, the outer ring itself enjoys only intermittent connectivity between stations, with an almost 25% chance for a failed jump between outer maws. As such, this far- removed swath of space, called the Galactic Frontier, is as unexplored as it is lawless.": "与银河系中的大多数前哨站不同，Maws是统一的中立。所有的生命，甚至那些来自遥远存在的星球的生命，都被欢迎自由地穿越这些站点，而不用担心遭到报复。恶魔和天使可以在酒馆里同桌共饮，混沌兽可以和来自法律世界的合同管理人在航运清单上讨价还价，最激烈的敌对种族可以在主要法庭上敲定他们民族之间的条约。维持这种和平与中立的是两个独特的群体：阿莫博伊德（amoeboids）和墓穴骑士团（Order of the Sepulcher），前者是一个看守种族，隐约可见的人形，半透明渗出物，原产于大嘴。虽然精灵是第一个发现并使用巨口的人形种族，但他们的创造和创造者都被笼罩在神秘之中。这个谜团只有少数部分被揭开，最突出的是变形虫本身。鉴于它们是唯一原产于巨口的生物，它们似乎被赋予了持续维护和保养这些站点的任务，而且特别愿意这样做。然而，变形金刚的历史中没有关于它们的起源的记录，实际上也没有关于Maws的起源的记录。银河边疆。在巨嘴网络的绝对连通性方面只有一个例外：与最外环的站点的联系是单向的，允许向银河系的外缘过境，但不能返回。此外，外环本身只享有车站之间的间歇性连接，在外爪之间跳跃失败的几率几乎为25%。因此，这片被称为 \"银河边疆 \"的遥远空间，既未被开发，又无法无天。",

Through different lenses, wizards, engineers, alchemists, and scientists all struggle to understand its fundamental mysteries, but nothing exposes their ignorance more so than the Void.": "就其核心而言，宇宙似乎是建立在不可理解的基础上。通过不同的视角，巫师、工程师、炼金术士和科学家都在努力理解它的基本奥秘，但没有什么比虚空更能暴露他们的无知了。",
	"The {@b Void} is not a plane of existence like the Material or Elemental planes; in fact, it is very much their opposite. The Void represents the space between planes, the absence of everything, containing nothing—not sound, nor space, nor time.

	"By entering the Void and traveling through it, ships can leap vast distances in the blink of an eye. In such a process, called a {@b Void Jump}, ships are warped to an infinitesimal size for the briefest possible time, from which they can take a step in any direction and hop across the universe. Greater jumps require more energy, but allow longer steps from the Void through the 'verse; doing so, of course, is extremely perilous.": "通过进入虚空并在其中旅行，飞船可以在一眨眼的时间内飞跃很远的距离。在这种被称为\"%0%\"的过程中，飞船在最短的时间内被扭曲成一个无限小的尺寸，从那里它们可以向任何方向迈出一步，跳过宇宙。更大的跳跃需要更多的能量，但允许从虚空中穿过'诗篇'的更长步骤；当然，这样做是非常危险的。",
	"Paradoxically, the Void is filled with streams of hideous lights, which filter in from the most gravitationally extreme parts of all other universes and planes of existence. Because the Void has no substance and is adjacent to all possible realities, only the most energetic radiation passes into it, all of which is antithetical to living things. Any creature exposed to the Void is irrevocably changed, hideously mutated in a process called 'the warp.' To avoid such a fate, most pilots jump blind from behind protective blast shields, relying only on tenuous magical navigation. Even technological assists fail and are burned out in the Void; unless protected beneath a thick, metallic hull, nothing withstands its ravages for long.": "矛盾的是，虚空充满了可怕的光流，这些光流从所有其他宇宙和存在平面的引力最极端的地方过滤进来。因为虚空没有物质，而且与所有可能的现实相邻，所以只有能量最强的辐射进入其中，所有这些都是与生物相反的。任何暴露在虚空中的生物都会发生不可逆转的变化，在一个被称为 \"扭曲 \"的过程中发生可怕的变异。 为了避免这样的命运，大多数飞行员从保护性的爆炸盾牌后面盲目跳下，只依靠脆弱的魔法导航。即使是技术辅助工具也会在虚空中失败并被烧毁；除非在厚实的金属船体下得到保护，否则没有任何东西能长期抵御虚空的蹂躏。",
	"It is exceptionally difficult to access the Void from the confines of planetary gravity, making in-atmosphere void jumps all but impossible.": "从行星引力的范围内进入虚空是非常困难的，这使得大气层内的虚空跳跃几乎不可能。",
	"Even though the universe of Dark Matter is filled with strange and fascinating worlds, it is still possible to find oneself on the Elemental Plane of Fire or swimming in the Ethereal Plane. The various planes of existence can be thought of as alternate dimensions, different layers of the dimension that makes up reality. Some of these planes, like the Elemental Planes, can be accessed from anywhere, whereas others, like demiplanes and planes related to the afterlives of specific faiths, can only be accessed from certain parts of the universe, on certain worlds, or if other special requirements are met.": "尽管暗物质的宇宙充满了奇怪而迷人的世界，但仍有可能发现自己在火元素位面或在空灵位面游泳。各种存在的平面可以被认为是替代的维度，是构成现实的维度的不同层次。其中一些平面，如元素平面，可以从任何地方进入，而其他平面，如半平面和与特定信仰的来世有关的平面，只能从宇宙的某些地方、某些世界进入，或满足其他特殊要求。",
	"The universe of Dark Matter also introduces the Void, a dimensionless realm beyond and between all the other planes. It can be useful to think about the Void as being a baseline dimension; it represents what's left over when all the other layers of reality have been stripped away, leaving nothing, not even space or time.": "暗物质的宇宙还引入了虚空，一个超越所有其他平面的无维度领域。把虚空想成一个基准维度可能是有用的；它代表了当现实的所有其他层面被剥离后剩下的东西，什么都没有留下，甚至没有空间或时间。",
	"Generally, it is impossible to use spells like plane shift for an interplanar shortcut across the universe, but the Void provides a unique exception. However, void jumps are only possible on the Material Plane; the void crystals which power them are dangerously unstable and will spontaneously collapse if brought to another plane.": "一般来说，不可能使用像平面转移这样的法术来实现跨越宇宙的星际捷径，但虚空提供了一个独特的例外。然而，虚空跳跃只有在物质位面才有可能；为其提供动力的虚空水晶是危险的不稳定的，如果被带到另一个位面就会自发崩溃。",

	"When most humanoids eat a live roach, a mind- expanding wave of euphoria and vivid hallucinations, known as \"the mists,\" washes over them.

	"Roaches can't be bred in most places, even with good nutrition and habitats. Very few worlds, which apparently lie along unseen intersections in the universe's ley lines, can sustain roach life and allow for new roach broods. Roaches that are taken off-world promptly become infertile and normally die after about a year. Of course, only living roaches cause the mists, so trade of these creatures is extremely competitive.": "蟑螂在大多数地方都不能被繁殖，即使有良好的营养和栖息地。很少有世界，显然是位于宇宙雷系的看不见的交叉点上，可以维持蟑螂的生命，并允许新的蟑螂繁殖。被带出世界的蟑螂会迅速变得不孕不育，通常在大约一年后死亡。当然，只有活着的蟑螂才会引起迷雾，所以这些生物的交易是非常有竞争力的。",
	"The crippling psychological addiction isn't the only downside of eating live roaches. Despite their size, roaches are weakly psychic, and can empathetically communicate simple ideas to creatures around them. Strong emotions, like fear and affection, come across most vividly. It is probably some psychic effect at the moment of their deaths that causes the mists, which explains why alchemists have been unable to replicate it. Regardless, more than one pilot has stopped eating roaches—and willingly endured the terrible withdrawal period—simply because the pangs of guilt had grown too much to bear.": "残缺的心理成瘾并不是吃活蟑螂的唯一缺点。尽管蟑螂体型庞大，但它们的灵性很弱，能以同理心将简单的想法传达给周围的生物。强烈的情感，如恐惧和爱意，会表现得淋漓尽致。可能是它们死亡时的某种精神效应导致了迷雾，这解释了为什么炼金术士无法复制它。不管怎么说，不止一个飞行员停止了吃桃子--并且愿意忍受可怕的戒断期--仅仅是因为内疚的痛苦已经变得难以承受。",
	"The first bold steps toward galactic empires wouldn't have been possible without remarkable advances in techno- magical theory and application. While, for eons, powerful wizards and sorcerers have been able to alter the fabric of reality, gods have had total reign of their own planes of existence, and demons, dragons, and all manner of eldritch creatures have leveraged their arcane might to bend worlds to their will, the common person has always had little to no contact with the arcane or the fantastical. In this age of automatons, interstellar empires, and pan- galactic communication, however, nearly everyone enjoys access to some form of enchantments, magics, or artifacts.": "如果没有技术--魔法理论和应用方面的显著进步，迈向星系帝国的第一个大胆步骤是不可能的。虽然长久以来，强大的魔法师和巫师能够改变现实的结构，神明能够完全控制他们自己的存在平面，恶魔、龙和各种长生生物能够利用他们的奥术力量使世界屈服于他们的意志，但普通人总是很少甚至没有接触到奥术或幻想。然而，在这个自动机、星际帝国和泛银河系通讯的时代，几乎每个人都能获得某种形式的魔法、魔术或文物。",
	"Low level magics have become nearly as commonplace across the 'verse as once were torches, pitchforks, and horses. While most people still can't banish a demon with the wave of their hand or rain fire down from the sky with a word, most have ready access to hardlight-projecting consoles, datapads which allow communication from one planet to another, healing apparatuses that work as well as any cleric, and other similar wondrous items. Magic, as far as the 'verse is concerned, is no longer at odds with technology: it has become technology.": "低级魔法在整个 \"诗篇 \"中几乎已经成为普遍现象，就像曾经的火把、干草叉和马匹一样。虽然大多数人仍然无法通过挥手驱逐恶魔，或者用一句话从天上降下火焰，但大多数人都可以随时使用硬光投影控制台，允许从一个星球到另一个星球进行通信的数据板，与任何牧师一样好用的治疗设备，以及其他类似的奇妙物品。就'诗篇'而言，魔法不再与技术相抵触：它已经成为技术。",
	"Modern magical technology traces its lineage back to traditional magic items, which possess incredible arcane potential and wondrous self-recharging properties—benefits which are tempered only by the fact that their construction demands months of work from a master artisan and centuries of arcane expertise to devise.

At first, these processes resulted only in half-baked imitations of magic items, but soon, the face of modern magical technology began to develop.": "现代魔法技术可以追溯到传统的魔法物品，它们拥有令人难以置信的奥术潜力和奇妙的自我充电特性--这些好处只是因为它们的建造需要工匠大师几个月的工作和几个世纪的奥术专业知识才能设计出来。随着银河系雷线的发现和后来的开发，魔法物品的建造变得工业化：一次性的、标准化的、廉价的。起初，这些工艺只产生了半生不熟的魔法物品的仿制品，但很快，现代魔法技术的面貌开始发展。",
	"A common element found across almost all arcane technology is arcane batteries—small, self-recharging power sources, whose energy can be adapted to nearly any application, from producing bursts of laser fire, to levitating objects, to creating holographic projections. Most of the time, the inner-workings of magical technology involves converting this power using a circuit of arcane components, such as abjurators, evocation shifters, illusiometers, somati-cyclers, and conjuration processors. The end result is a finely-tuned magical effect, exactly duplicating the efforts of a skilled spellcaster (with some limitations), but requiring almost no skill on behalf of the user. This new style of item creation is driven as much by mundane artisans, scientists, and entrepreneurs as it is by wizards or sorcerers, which is reflected in their designs.

Early ships often combined the principles and designs of ocean-sailing vessels, primitive gliders, and flying machines, and used levitation magic to achieve the desired effect. While these early ships couldn't perform the all-important void jump, they were fast enough to ferry their passengers between their homeworlds and nearby planets or moons, laying the groundwork for future expansion into the stars.": "尽管在发现暗物质引擎之前，它们被限制在相对较短的距离内，但'诗篇'中大多数著名的种族都有涉足近轨道或星际旅行的悠久历史。早期的飞船往往结合了远洋航行的船只、原始的滑翔机和飞行器的原理和设计，并使用浮空魔法来达到预期的效果。虽然这些早期的飞船不能进行至关重要的虚空跳跃，但它们的速度足以在它们的家园和附近的行星或卫星之间运送乘客，为未来向星际扩张奠定了基础。",
	"Somehow more pervasive than starships, {@filter blasters|items|Property=Blaster} are go-to weapons for most everyone in the 'verse.

Originally crafted in the profile of a hand crossbow without the limbs attached, the blaster quickly gained prominence as the premier weapon technology in the 'verse: simple to understand, easy to use, and remarkably deadly, with the added benefit of never needing to be reloaded.": "在某种程度上比星舰更普遍，{@filter blasters|items|Property=Blaster}是'诗篇'中大多数人的常用武器。最基本的是，爆破器是一种带有弧形电池和聚焦光圈的手持设备，当扣动扳机时，被设计成发射能量光束或 \"闪电\"。爆破器最初是按照手弩的外形制作的，没有连接肢体，很快就获得了突出的地位，成为诗篇中最重要的武器技术：简单易懂，易于使用，而且具有明显的杀伤力，还有一个额外的好处就是永远不需要重新装弹。",
	"Far from the short-range prototypes first pioneered by dwarven inventors, blasters today come in a dizzying array of shapes, styles, and functions, though there are clearly accepted favorites. Moreover, blaster technology has been adapted for ship use, allowing an enterprising captain to outfit their vessel with entire batteries of guns.": "与矮人发明家最初开创的短程原型相比，今天的爆破器有一系列令人眼花缭乱的形状、样式和功能，尽管有明显的公认的最爱。此外，爆破器技术已被改编为船舶使用，允许一个有进取心的船长为他们的船只配备整个枪支电池。",
	"While the old standards of bows, axes, and swords are still fairly widespread (especially on less advanced planets and among races, such as the Skathári, that favor traditional weapons), one would be hard-pressed to visit any settled world in the 'verse and not find someone brandishing a blaster. Adventurers might favor other, more eccentric weapons, such as the laser sword and rocket hammer, but they'd be mad not to have a magnus or repeater holstered at their side.": "虽然弓、斧和剑的旧标准仍然相当普遍（特别是在不太先进的星球和种族中，如Skathári，他们喜欢传统的武器），但人们很难在访问'诗篇'中的任何定居世界时不发现有人挥舞着爆破枪。冒险家们可能更喜欢其他更古怪的武器，如激光剑和火箭锤，但他们不把马格努斯或连发枪藏在身边就太疯狂了。",
	"The boundaries of the 'verse have always been pushed by intrepid galactic explorers and adventurers, a group which always seems to be in high demand and short supply. Despite the sheer number of worlds that have been mapped and colonized, there remains countless systems yet undiscovered and mysteries yet unsolved. Anyone that wishes to strike out into the 'verse and make a name for themselves need only have a ship, quick wits, and a boundless reservoir of daring.": "银河系的边界一直是由无畏的银河系探险家和冒险家推动的，这个群体似乎总是供不应求。尽管已经有大量的世界被测绘和殖民，但仍有无数的系统尚未被发现，仍有无数的谜团尚未解决。任何希望进入'se'并为自己扬名立万的人，只需要有一艘船、快速的智慧和无限的胆量。",
	"While much of the galaxy has been charted, cataloged, and colonized by one faction or another, there is by no means a comprehensive map of the 'verse. Unlike with terrestrial cartography, the features of the galaxy are always in flux; as such, there is exceptional money to be made in providing up-to-date star charts and void jump routes to the spacefaring community. The last thing a major shipping outfit needs is to deal with one of their cargo ships unexpectedly jumping into the middle of a Dead Magic Zone while carrying a load of adamantine ore or a shipment of priceless artifacts.": "虽然银河系的大部分地区已经被一个或另一个派别绘制了地图，编了目录，并被殖民了，但绝没有一张全面的'se'的地图。与陆地制图不同，银河系的特征总是在不断变化；因此，向航天界提供最新的星图和虚空跳跃路线，可以赚到很多钱。一个主要的航运公司最不愿意看到的是，他们的一艘货船在装载金刚砂矿石或无价文物时，意外地跳到了死亡魔区的中间。",
	"Similarly, planetary scans and surveys are an invaluable source of revenue for interstellar adventurers. The continuing expansion of the galactic community requires a constant stream of new materials, habitable worlds, outpost-worthy systems, and other resources. Scans of newly discovered worlds can prove invaluable, as being the first to discover a new world generally grants the discoverer right to claim ownership. Of course, while any discoverer can stake a claim over a planet, only huge factions can defend their claims, so most career scanners sell their data (and subsequent rights of territory) to larger organizations.": "同样，行星扫描和调查也是星际冒险家的一个宝贵的收入来源。银河系社会的持续扩张需要源源不断的新材料、可居住的世界、适合前哨的系统和其他资源。对新发现的世界的扫描可以被证明是非常有价值的，因为作为第一个发现一个新世界的人，通常会赋予发现者要求所有权的权利。当然，虽然任何发现者都可以对一个星球提出权利要求，但只有巨大的派别才能捍卫他们的权利要求，因此大多数职业扫描者将他们的数据（以及随后的领土权）卖给更大的组织。",
	"While perhaps less dangerous than surveying, making your career as a galactic cartographer or planet scanner is by no means leisurely or safe. Not counting the numerous astronomical hazards they must endure, a potential candidate must have a ship with an appropriately powerful Dark Matter engine and all the required mapping and scanning equipment, especially if they plan to chart the Frontier. To that end, most scanners end up signing on with one of the many cartography companies and firms scattered throughout the 'verse, who provide ships, man power, and equipment in exchange for a substantial cut of the discovery profits. Of these, the most expansive is Astrogations Inc.": "虽然可能没有测量那么危险，但作为银河系制图师或行星扫描仪的职业绝不是轻松或安全的。不算他们必须忍受的无数天文危险，一个潜在的候选人必须有一艘带有适当的强大的暗物质引擎和所有必要的绘图和扫描设备的飞船，特别是如果他们打算为边境地区绘图的话。为此，大多数扫描者最终与散布在整个'se'的许多制图公司和企业中的一家签约，他们提供船只、人力和设备，以换取发现利润的大量分成。在这些公司中，最广泛的是Astrogations公司。",
	"For adventurers with more modest budgets, scavenging can provide a lucrative, if unreliable, source of income and adventure. Due to the Black's utter stillness, a wrecked ship (and the potentially valuable components and cargo within) can remain pristine for hundreds of years without rusting or wearing away. Navigating the derelict wreck of a star cruiser destroyed in some long- forgotten battle can be a quick way to find a crate of valuable munitions, expensive blasters, or rare minerals; of course, it can also mean getting attacked by husks, eaten by a spaceshark, or captured by the wroth. Though scavenging doesn't require an expensive ship, the best loot is often in dangerous areas of the 'verse—places that demand a nimble ship or one with substantial firepower. Moreover, the means to haul heavy or dangerous cargo is a necessity, as worthy scrap is often only purchased by the ton and valuable cargo is often highly volatile.": "对于预算较少的冒险者来说，拾荒可以提供一个有利可图的收入和冒险来源，尽管不可靠。由于黑海的完全静止，一艘失事的船只（以及其中潜在的有价值的部件和货物）可以在数百年内保持原始状态而不生锈或磨损。在某个被遗忘已久的战斗中被摧毁的星际巡洋舰的废弃残骸中航行，可以快速找到一箱有价值的弹药、昂贵的爆破器或稀有的矿物；当然，这也意味着被沙尘攻击、被太空鲨吃掉或被邪恶的人抓走。虽然搜刮不需要昂贵的飞船，但最好的战利品往往是在'se'的危险区域--那些需要灵活的飞船或具有强大火力的地方。此外，运输重型或危险货物的方法也是必要的，因为有价值的废料往往只能按吨购买，而有价值的货物往往非常不稳定。",
	"Similarly, scavengers can mount terrestrial expeditions to newly discovered worlds or archaeological sites. Even in the era of galactic travel, the price of ancient and magical artifacts remains high, especially among collectors who value old-world designs. On almost any station in the 'verse, aspiring dungeon delvers can find jobs that require grit, know-how, and the ability to disarm and survive ancient deathtraps, in return for piles of treasure.": "同样地，拾荒者可以对新发现的世界或考古地点进行陆地探险。即使在银河系旅行的时代，古代和魔法文物的价格仍然很高，特别是在那些重视旧世界设计的收藏家中。在这个世界上的几乎任何一个站点，有抱负的地牢探险者都能找到需要勇气、技术和能力的工作，以解除古代的死亡陷阱并在其中生存，从而换取成堆的财宝。",
	"Most jobs of this nature tend to be funded through private collectors, who provide a general map of a given location, a basic stipend, and the promise of loot in return for the coveted bauble said to be located within. Most often, scavengers hired to retrieve artifacts are required to provide their own ship, arms, and necessary support, but in turn, the collector takes a smaller cut of the haul. The major exceptions to this rule are the Artifactor teams of Drog, Dusset, & Durgen Acquisitions & Trade, the largest and most well-funded relic traders in the 'verse: well-equipped and generously paid, Artifactors sign long contracts in exchange for their consistent retrievals and their unwavering loyalty to DD&D.": "大多数这种性质的工作都是通过私人收藏家资助的，他们提供一个特定地点的一般地图、基本的津贴，并承诺提供战利品以换取据说位于其中的令人垂涎的宝物。大多数情况下，被雇来取回文物的拾荒者需要提供自己的船只、武器和必要的支持，但反过来，收藏家也会从战利品中抽出一小部分。这条规则的主要例外是Drog、Dusset和Durgen Acquisitions & Trade的神器团队，他们是这个世界上最大、资金最充足的文物交易商：装备精良、报酬丰厚，神器们签署了长期合同，以换取他们持续的检索和对DD&D的坚定忠诚。",
	"For those who have no explicit desire for exploration or excavation, there is mercenary work, the time-honored tradition of shooting people and getting paid for it. Since the early days of rapid galactic expansion, the need for paid soldiers, body guards, thugs, and other forms of muscle has been a bloody constant. In the most war-torn areas of the 'verse, especially at the borders of the Warzone, there is always a place for a grizzled ex-soldier looking to ply their trade, a hungry warmage looking to prove themselves, or a skilled assassin eager to put a high- profile notch on their blade.": "对于那些没有明确的探索或挖掘欲望的人来说，还有雇佣兵的工作，这是一个历史悠久的传统，即开枪打人并获得报酬。自从银河系快速扩张的早期，对付费士兵、保镖、打手和其他形式的肌肉的需求一直是一个血腥的常态。在战争最激烈的地区，特别是在战区的边界，总是有一个地方需要一个灰头土脸的前士兵来从事他们的工作，一个饥饿的暖男想要证明自己，或者一个熟练的刺客渴望在他们的刀片上留下一个高调的缺口。",
	"Coupled with this is the near ubiquitous presence of bounty hunters. While the galaxy isn't without universal laws, most areas of jurisdiction are limited to specific regions of space. Sanctioned and licensed bounty hunters can bypass many of these restrictions, tracking criminals and wanted targets into neighboring systems, isolated planets, or even into the lawless Frontier.": "再加上赏金猎人几乎无处不在的存在。虽然银河系并不是没有普遍的法律，但大多数的管辖区域都被限制在特定的空间区域。经过批准和许可的赏金猎人可以绕过许多这些限制，追踪罪犯和被通缉的目标到邻近的系统、孤立的星球，甚至到无法无天的边境地区。",
	"Finding mercenary work is generally an easy feat for anyone that looks tough and can point a blaster in the right direction. However, securing a position with a well-known mercenary company can be much trickier, as the best companies only accept the smartest and toughest hired guns available. Gaining a position within such a unit requires a reputation of being loyal and highly skilled, and proving that track record over a number of jobs.": "对于任何一个看起来很强硬的人来说，找到雇佣兵工作通常是一件很容易的事，而且可以把爆破手指向正确的方向。然而，要在知名的雇佣兵公司获得一个职位可能要棘手得多，因为最好的公司只接受最聪明、最强悍的雇佣兵。要在这样的单位获得一个职位，需要有忠诚和高技能的声誉，并在一些工作中证明这一记录。",
	"Likewise, becoming a bounty hunter isn't terribly difficult, but the particulars of obtaining licenses can be daunting. Generally, working within a given jurisdiction requires bounty hunters to pass licensing exams, demonstrating that they understand the languages of the given area and the laws that govern it. This can be a difficult task, as laws and languages vary from planet to planet. Of course, a potential bounty hunter can simply choose to operate illegally and under the radar, but doing so runs afoul of both the law and more legitimate bounty hunters, sometimes ironically resulting in bounty hunters pursuing their illegal rivals.": "同样，成为一名赏金猎人并不十分困难，但获得许可证的具体细节可能令人生畏。一般来说，在一个特定的管辖区工作需要赏金猎人通过许可考试，以证明他们了解特定地区的语言和法律。这可能是一项艰巨的任务，因为不同星球的法律和语言各不相同。当然，潜在的赏金猎人可以简单地选择在雷达下非法运作，但这样做会触犯法律和更多合法的赏金猎人，有时会讽刺地导致赏金猎人追捕他们的非法对手。",
	"For most adventurers in the 'verse, spacing is a means to an end—a way to get from one job to the next. For dedicated spacers who make their living flying between the stars, the ship is both the means and the end. In even greater demand than hired muscle, shipping crews form the backbone of galactic society, ferrying goods, people, and services of all sorts between ports of call across the 'verse.": "对于大多数冒险者来说，空间是达到目的的一种手段--从一个工作到下一个工作的方式。对于那些以在星际间飞行为生的专职太空人来说，飞船既是手段也是目的。船员的需求甚至比雇佣兵还要大，他们构成了银河系社会的骨干，在整个宇宙的各个港口之间运送货物、人员和各种服务。",
	"Even short journeys through the Black require a competent crew to man the ship: captains, pilots, astrogators, gunners, defense personnel, medics, cooks, engineers, and many other roles are necessary to bring the largest ships to life. Adventurers of almost any background and skill-set can find a position working on a ship, even for one-time jobs. Such positions might not pay as well as other jobs, but they are discreet and dependable.": "即使是短暂的黑夜之旅，也需要一个有能力的船员来管理船只：船长、飞行员、星际探险家、炮手、防卫人员、医务人员、厨师、工程师和许多其他角色都是必要的，以使最大的船只成为生命。几乎任何背景和技能的冒险者都能找到在船上工作的职位，甚至是一次性的工作。这样的职位可能没有其他工作的报酬高，但他们是谨慎和可靠的。",
	"Regardless of their actual occupation, most adventurers spend as much time aboard a ship as a dedicated spacer. In fact, the downtime of more exciting jobs, such as military service, body-guarding, and exploration is practically identical to generic spacing work, so many recruits are expected to have some prerequisite experience on a shipping or trading vessel. It is on these all-purpose spacing jobs where most intrepid adventurers have their first run-ins with the myriad dangers of the 'verse, where they cut their teeth on heroism, and where they hone their skills.": "无论他们的实际职业如何，大多数冒险者在船上花费的时间与专门的太空人一样多。事实上，更刺激的工作，如军事服务、保镖和探索，其停工时间几乎与一般的间隔工作相同，所以许多新兵被期望在航运或贸易船上有一些先决条件的经验。正是在这些通用的间隔工作中，大多数无畏的冒险者第一次接触到了'se'的无数危险，他们在这里切磋英雄主义，并在这里磨练他们的技能。",
	"Many humanoid races can be found on isolated worlds throughout the galaxy, which themselves look like a microcosm of the galactic community, with elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, and others sharing a single planet. Of course, it would be absurd for so many diverse races to develop on the same world; all these humanoids can trace their origins to different systems among the stars. In some cases, seeding new worlds with humanoids is a deliberate experiment or colonization effort, but most often, isolated populations of humanoids are the result of miscalculations in navigation or mistakes of teleportation magic.": "在整个银河系的孤立世界上可以找到许多人形种族，这些世界本身就像银河系社会的一个缩影，精灵、矮人、人类、半身人和其他人共享一个星球。当然，这么多不同的种族在同一个世界上发展是很荒谬的；所有这些人形生物都可以追溯到他们在恒星中的不同系统的起源。在某些情况下，用人形生物播种新的世界是一种故意的实验或殖民努力，但大多数情况下，孤立的人形生物种群是导航中的误判或传送魔法的错误造成的。",
	"Amorphous, bizarre, and remarkably advanced, {@race amoeboid|darkmatter|amoeboids} are the very definition of alien. Encountering them is practically dizzying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague forms and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum of blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.": "无定形的、怪异的、非常先进的，（%0%）是外星人的定义。遇到它们，对于第一次来到大嘴的游客来说，几乎是头晕目眩：它们阴森透明的身体闪烁着昏暗的有机光，变形为模糊的形式和各种生物的不完美拷贝，所有这些都伴随着模糊和音调的奇怪哼唱。虽然宇宙擅长生产各种形状和大小的生物，但变形虫是真正独特的东西。",
	"Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cutting- edge intersection of science and arcana.": "此外，变形金刚具有超凡的智慧，许多人拥有使用机器的天赋。他们是第一批进入太空的种族之一（如果考虑到他们的起源，则是第一批），并且仍然是暗物质技术的先驱。大多数变形金刚对科学推理抱有极大的信心，以至于一个健全的统计模型往往比报告的事件更有说服力。当然，这也延伸到了魔法研究中，阿米巴人的技术处于科学和奥术的尖端交汇处。",
	"Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply discovered on the maws. Some speculate that the amoeboids evolved there among the advanced technology, but just as many support the theory that amoeboids were designed and purposefully placed on the maws.": "如此独特的人形生物应该来自同样独特的家园，但事实并非如此；amoeboids只是在大颚上被发现。一些人推测，变形金刚是在那里的先进技术中演化出来的，但同样有很多人支持变形金刚是被设计出来的，并被有目的地放置在大颚上的理论。",
	"The universe has no shortage of mysteries and enigmas, but scholars have long agreed that the origin of the maws, and how the amoeboids came to inhabit them, is the Grand Mystery. After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.": "宇宙中不乏神秘和谜团，但学者们早就同意，大口怪的起源，以及变形金刚是如何居住在其中的，才是大谜团。毕竟，如此神奇的事情不可能仅仅是巧合；巨口是一个现成的交通网络，连接着银河系的远方，并有一个足够聪明的变形金刚种族来理解它们，并有足够的技能来维护它们。事实上，如果没有亲身观察过巨口站，大多数种族可能永远不会发现暗物质技术。每个技术发现都是建立在巨人的肩膀上，但在这种情况下，巨人却神秘地消失了。",
	"More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it's unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?": "更令人困惑的是，这些巨口在本质上不仅仅是技术性的；它们是在早已死亡的生物的巨大骨架上建造的。骨头本身似乎至关重要，因为没有它们就不可能创造出一个稳定的巨口，但它们所扮演的角色却让研究人员完全摸不着头脑。此外，目前还不清楚是什么类型的生物留下了这些骨头，因为今天没有任何活着的东西与它们有丝毫相似。这些生物是否已经灭绝，或者只是还没有被发现？它们是否来自银河系内部，或者甚至来自我们的宇宙内部？",
	"For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids, learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed \"zero\" generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.": "就他们而言，变形金刚对大奥秘几乎没有答案；他们的起源对他们来说和其他人一样难以捉摸。最早的变形虫记录可以追溯到变形虫的第一个实例，它们学会了如何与巨嘴终端连接并记录数据，也许是在所谓的 \"零 \"世代之后的一个世纪。在这之前是一个短暂但无法穿透的黑暗时代，一直延伸到巨口的激活，掩盖了它们的起源。",
	"It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation.": "从科学的参照系中寻找答案是他们的天性，但真正的证据到目前为止还很难找到。人们猜测 \"老云 \"参与了这个谜团，但他扮演了什么角色还不清楚。也许这个大谜团被一个或多个强大的创造者故意掩盖了，也许所有参与其中的人都缺少一些关键的部分，一些将变形金刚、大嘴和他们神秘的创造联系起来的洞察力。",
	"Before most races mastered spaceflight and journeyed to the stars, the only records of amoeboids were of bug-eyed visitors from another world, arriving by night in strange saucers to abduct livestock and flash otherworldly lights. Amoeboids were among the first to travel the stars (their ships derived from technology found on the maws), and they did so with purely scientific intentions: every alien planet, star, nebula, and creature they discover is studied, categorized, and detailed in a vast database of arcane terminals called the {@b Compendium}. This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.": "在大多数种族掌握了航天技术并前往恒星之前，关于阿莫博伊德的唯一记录是来自另一个世界的虫眼访客，他们乘着奇怪的飞碟在夜间抵达，绑架牲畜并闪耀着异世界的光芒。Amoeboids是第一批在星际旅行的人（他们的飞船来自于在Maws上发现的技术），他们这样做是出于纯粹的科学目的：他们发现的每一个外星行星、恒星、星云和生物都被研究、分类，并在一个被称为{@b Compendium}的庞大的神秘终端数据库中详细说明。这个单一的数据库，收集了几乎所有他们知道的东西，是一个科学奇迹，是所有阿米巴人成就的纪念碑。",
	"To this day, amoeboids are the only race that maintains a non-involvement policy in their visits to other worlds, keeping their distance, observing remotely when possible, and experimenting only when disturbance can be minimized. The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community.": "时至今日，amoeboids是唯一一个在访问其他世界时保持不参与政策的种族，他们保持距离，在可能的情况下进行远程观察，并且只在干扰可以最小化的情况下进行实验。不参与的唯一例外是那些已经前往大嘴的太空种族；阿墨博伊人以平等的身份迎接这些群体，并欢迎他们进入银河系社区。",
	"The bird-headed {@race avia-ra|darkmatter} might almost be confused for humans from the neck down, but unlike the scores of near- humans that pervade the galaxy, the avia-ra are unrelated to humanity. Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun's blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal.": "鸟头人（%0%）从脖子往下看几乎可以和人类混淆，但与弥漫在银河系的数十种近似人类不同，阿维亚拉人与人类没有关系。他们来自凯美特，一个严酷的沙漠星球，河流和湖泊纵横交错，他们一直知道对太阳的祝福和残酷的欣赏，这构成了他们宗教的支柱，激发了他们的艺术和科学，并影响了他们对宇宙的看法。他们的教条完全围绕着他们的神灵和圣洁的星星--天上的太阳，没有人可以与之相提并论。",
	"When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical \"true star\" from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.": "然而，当阿维亚人迈出他们进入太空飞行的第一步时，他们的宗教就开始弯曲并适应他们发现自己所处的更广阔的宇宙。突然间，他们的太阳不再是Deshret，即他们的家园所围绕的那颗星，而是一颗理论上的 \"真星\"，所有的星星，包括他们自己的星星，都从这里获得了意义。几个世纪后，他们才冒险来到银河系的中心，遇到了他们认为是 \"太阳之上 \"的实际体现的东西：墓穴星。",
	"In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.": "在那些日子里，海王星的轨道离银河系核心的黑洞更远，而且它肯定是在精灵的控制之下。avia-ra很快就从精灵那里了解到，海王星不仅仅是一颗恒星，而是包含了某种超大质量的结构。尽管对精灵来说，这只是一个学术上的好奇，但这一发现激励了阿维亚人：在这颗恒星的中心，靠近银河系的确切中心，是他们的太阳。在接下来的几个世纪里，avia-ra悄悄地加强和聚集他们的舰队，为第一次十字军东征做准备。",
	"This was the first of many Crusades, bloody battles between the avia-ra and the elves for control of the center of the galaxy. Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star—a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression. In short order, it was seized by an elven sneak attack; ever since, the Citadel has become a flashpoint for conflict and a central focus for Crusades.": "这是许多次十字军东征中的第一次，是阿维亚拉人和精灵之间为控制银河系中心而进行的血腥战斗。每一次十字军东征都以签署条约为标志，从战斗中得到喘息，并巩固力量。总是，双方中的一方的突然袭击重新点燃了冲突。在第三次十字军东征中，阿维亚人在墓穴星周围的轨道上建造了巨大的太阳城，这是一座圣城，为了太阳的荣耀和阻止精灵的侵略而建造。很快，它就被精灵的偷袭所占领；从那时起，太阳城就成了冲突的爆发点和十字军东征的中心。",
	"The most recent of these battles, called the {@b Night Crusade}, nearly saw the wholesale destruction of the Elven Empire. The holy avia-ra fleet, known as the Congregation, captured the center of the galaxy in a series of decisive victories and pushed the elves back to their home system. In this moment, the balance of the galaxy was threatened, and the elves struck a bargain: in exchange for their assistance, the elves would liberate the vect across their empire—a move which would eventually pave the way for vect freedom across the 'verse.": "这些战役中最近的一次，被称为{@b Night Crusade}，几乎看到了精灵帝国的全盘毁灭。被称为 \"圣会 \"的神圣的avia-ra舰队在一系列决定性的胜利中占领了银河系的中心，并将精灵们赶回了他们的母星系。在这一时刻，银河系的平衡受到了威胁，精灵们达成了一个交易：作为对他们援助的交换，精灵们将解放整个帝国的vect--此举最终将为整个'诗篇'的vect自由铺平道路。",
	"The culmination of this deal was at the Battle of Alden'val, where the vect fleet turned the tide for the elves, critically wounding the avia-ra's flagship, The Prophet. The ensuing retreat made an opening for the Elven Forest-Fleet, which encircled the Congregation, spelling the end of the Crusade. The war ended with the signing of the {@b Treaty Black}, a document that quieted hostilities and established the {@b Order of the Sepulcher} to safeguard against similar crises in the future.": "这笔交易的高潮是在阿尔登谷战役中，维克特舰队为精灵们扭转了局势，重创了阿维亚拉的旗舰 \"先知 \"号。随后的撤退为精灵族的森林舰队打开了一个缺口，它包围了圣会，意味着十字军的结束。战争以签署{@b Treaty Black}而结束，这份文件平息了敌对行动，并建立了{@b Order of the Sepulcher}，以防止未来发生类似的危机。",
	"To some, the avia-ra's captivating dogma, high priesthood, and Congregation warfleet represent a light and peace in the 'verse, but to others, it represents a simmering kettle, just waiting to boil over.": "对一些人来说，阿维亚拉迷人的教条、高高在上的神职人员和圣会战队代表着 \"诗篇 \"中的光明与和平，但对其他人来说，它代表着一个沸腾的水壶，正等待着沸腾。",
	"In the past, the avia-ra have found little success spreading the message of the Sun Above to the established races of the 'verse. After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.": "过去，avia-ra发现向 \"诗篇 \"的既定种族传播 \"太阳之上 \"的信息并不成功。毕竟，他们的万神殿非常广泛，是他们社会的组成部分；一神教的神在他们中没有什么地位。相反，阿维亚人转向了原始文明，特别是那些未被发现的星球上的文明，与之分享他们的信息。",
	"The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.": "他们传教的模式很简单：在一个不发达的世界上建立一个文明，以他们的太阳宗教哲学为基础，在那里居住足够长的时间，以确保它留下持久的遗产，然后再一次离开，前往星空。在阿维亚拉宗教中，所有对太阳的崇拜都是对太阳神的间接崇拜，所以他们的光和火焰之神随着几个世纪的流逝而发生的任何演变都是无足轻重的；他们仍然是墓穴星中老吽的遗像。",
	"This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing—High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war. Thus, avia-ra evangelism occupies an uncomfortable, but tolerated position in the galaxy.": "至少可以说，这种做法是有争议的。许多世界都有来自其他世界的旅行者的古老故事，他们带来了太阳的祝福，而这些描述把他们描绘得很像神本身。尤其是人类，对这种不公平的传教行为很反感--高泰拉是阿维亚-拉传教士的早期目标。精灵和矮人认为他们自己的万神殿是神圣的，并从整体上谴责阿维亚拉传教士，但银河系社区几乎无能为力，除非煽动银河系战争。因此，阿维亚-拉的传教在银河系中占据了一个令人不舒服的位置，但却被容忍。",
	"Gruff, inventive, and stalwart, the dwarves of the 'verse are nearly identical to those living planetside. Despite spending most of their time in massive fleets of mining and war ships, star dwarves are just as comfortable in the bowels of a mountain as their terrestrial brethren. Indeed, the dwarves who make up the Galactic Dwarven Conclave know that the biggest and richest mountains to be mined are, in fact, asteroids drifting aimlessly through the Black.": "星际矮人粗犷、富有创造力、坚韧不拔，与生活在行星上的矮人几乎完全一样。尽管他们大部分时间都在庞大的采矿和战争船队中度过，但星际矮人在山腹中也和他们的陆地兄弟一样舒适。事实上，组成银河系矮人协约国的矮人知道，可以开采的最大和最丰富的山峰，实际上是漫无目的地在黑海中漂流的小行星。",
	"While terrestrial dwarves deviate into distinct branches based on familial lines, star dwarves, especially those from their homeworld of Jormund, take on traits which make them sturdier than their terrestrial brethren. The high gravity of their homeworld strengthens their bones and ensures their short, stocky stature, and a life spent doing industrial labor toughens their muscles into steel.": "虽然陆地上的矮人根据家族血统分成了不同的分支，但星际矮人，尤其是那些来自乔蒙德家园的矮人，所具有的特征使他们比陆地上的兄弟们更结实。他们家园的高重力强化了他们的骨骼，确保了他们短小精悍的身材，而从事工业劳动的生活则将他们的肌肉锻炼成钢铁。",
	"Dwarven expansion into space took a somewhat different route than most, in that there was little in the way of war or conquest. Ages before they discovered spaceflight, the dwarves had already founded the beginnings of the Conclave, which drove the interests of their entire race forward under one banner. When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy. To this day, no other interstellar race can match the raw material wealth or manufacturing skill of the dwarves, a fact which the Conclave would like to ensure.": "矮人向太空的扩张采取了与大多数人不同的路线，因为几乎没有战争或征服的方式。在他们发现太空飞行的年代之前，矮人已经建立了协约国的雏形，在一个旗帜下推动整个种族的利益。当他们开始向整个银河系扩张时，他们发现，尽管乔蒙是各种生命的宿主，但周围的系统却很贫瘠。然而，他们在居民方面的不足，在矿产资源方面得到了弥补。根据他们的本性，矮人将他们的技能、魔法和技术转向这些星球的开采，并将涌入的物质转化为银河系中最大的采矿和货运舰队。时至今日，没有任何一个星际种族能与矮人的原材料财富或制造技术相提并论，这也是协约国想要确保的事实。",
	"From the outside, Jormund, the second of three planets orbiting the star Jotun, seems like the least likely place to find a thriving race of people: it is a desolate ball of rock, pockmarked with craters, nearly devoid of atmosphere, and constantly blasted by radiation. Just below this stark surface, though, Jormund teems with life, not the least of which are the dwarves themselves.": "从外面看，乔蒙德是围绕约顿星运行的三颗行星中的第二颗，似乎是最不可能找到一个繁荣的种族的地方：它是一个荒凉的岩石球，布满了陨石坑，几乎没有大气层，而且经常受到辐射的冲击。然而，就在这严峻的表面之下，约顿星充满了生命，其中最重要的是矮人本身。",
	"The oldest dwarven records recall that Jormund once flourished with surface life. Eons ago, long before the dwarves fashioned their first ships from mountains and rockets, a great cataclysm befell the planet, forcing life on the planet to flee underground. The details of the old cataclysm are lost to time, for conflicting stories tell of different disasters, from a war caused by the greed of an ancient dwarven king, to the folly of an invention crafted by a mad blacksmith, to the poisonous breath of a spiteful dragon which contaminated the skies.": "最古老的矮人记录显示，乔蒙德曾经盛产地表生物。很久以前，在矮人用山和火箭制造出他们的第一艘船之前，一场巨大的灾难降临在这个星球上，迫使这个星球上的生命逃往地下。这场大灾难的细节已被时间湮没，因为相互矛盾的故事讲述了不同的灾难，从一个古老的矮人国王的贪婪引起的战争，到一个疯狂的铁匠的愚蠢的发明，再到一条有毒的龙的呼吸污染了天空。",
	"Despite being sequestered away under the surface, the subterranean dwarven cities are true marvels of engineering. Their tunnels stretch deep into the planet,  some reaching nearly to its core. The highest cities, which reach the surface itself are full of brisk winds and titanic granite stonework, while the lowest cities, nestled in artificially-cooled pockets within molten rock, are humid places of stunning obsidian towers. Indeed, within its rocky caverns and carved halls, the planet's interior, called the {@b Granite Throne}, can house nearly every inhabitant of dwarven space. This becomes a requirement at least once a generation, as each dwarf dedicated to the Conclave makes the journey home to elect two of their elders to supreme leadership, that of the Matriarch and the Patriarch.": "尽管被封存在地表之下，地下的矮人城市是真正的工程奇迹。他们的隧道延伸到了地球深处，有些几乎到达了地球的核心。最高的城市达到了地表本身，充满了凛冽的风和巨大的花岗岩石雕，而最低的城市，依偎在熔岩中人工冷却的口袋里，是潮湿的地方，有着令人惊叹的黑曜石塔。事实上，在它的岩石洞穴和雕刻的大厅里，这个星球的内部，被称为（%0%），几乎可以容纳矮人空间的所有居民。这成为每一代人至少一次的要求，因为每个致力于协约国的矮人都要回家，选举他们的两位长者担任最高领导，即母系长老和父系长老。",
	"Despite their peaceful expansion to the stars, dwarves retain every ounce of their legendary ruggedness, their love of strong drink, and their fury in battle. Dwarven soldiers and smiths are held in high regard across the 'verse as potential mercenaries or crew members⁠—many even think having a dwarf aboard is good luck. Dwarven spacecraft are praised just as highly: the Adamantine Fleet may not be as large as the Hegemony Armada nor as swift as an Elven Forest-Fleet, but its ships are nearly impossible to destroy. Coupled with the dwarven tendency to experiment with explosives, even a single dwarven ship can make for an astonishingly frightening foe.": "尽管他们和平地扩展到了星际，但矮人仍然保留了他们传说中的粗犷，他们对烈酒的喜爱，以及他们在战斗中的狂暴。矮人士兵和铁匠作为潜在的雇佣兵或船员在整个 \"诗篇 \"中受到高度重视--许多人甚至认为有一个矮人在船上是好运气。矮人的航天器也同样受到高度赞扬：亚当丁舰队可能不像霸权舰队那样庞大，也不像精灵森林舰队那样迅速，但它的船只几乎不可能被摧毁。再加上矮人对爆炸物的实验倾向，即使是一艘矮人飞船也能成为令人惊异的可怕敌人。",

	"Among the oldest and longest-lived races in the 'verse, elves were the first to harness their magical skill to extend their reach to the stars above. Svelte, stately, and regal to a fault, elves often view themselves as the true masters of the galaxy, a perspective which has sparked innumerable conflicts in ages past. While they are not physically much different from terrestrial elves (save for their tremendously long lifespans), elves of the 'verse are often referred to as \"Star Elves\" due to their wildly different outlook and their connection to the great stellar houses.": "在这个世界上最古老和最长寿的种族中，精灵是第一个利用他们的魔法技能将他们的触角延伸到星空的种族。精灵们身材苗条，体态端庄，有一种高贵的气质，他们常常把自己看作是银河系的真正主人，这种观点在过去的年代里引发了无数的冲突。虽然他们在身体上与陆地上的精灵没有什么不同（除了他们巨大的寿命），但由于他们狂野的前景和与伟大的恒星屋的联系，'诗篇'中的精灵经常被称为 \"星际精灵\"。",
	"Unlike the elven races of more isolated worlds, star elves are not split down genetic or racial lines; rather, they have deliberately self-separated into fantastically prominent Great Houses, or families, each of which claims sole residence of one of the planets in the elven home system. These separate families modify themselves to assume the traits of traditional elven subraces. In this way, even though star elves long ago homogenized to a single appearance, every variation of elf can still be found among their ranks. Their austere focus on house and family, while unifying, has also led to notoriously strict traditions regarding naming, relationships, and procreation.": "与更多孤立世界的精灵种族不同，星际精灵并没有按照基因或种族的界限进行分裂；相反，他们故意自我分离成奇特的大屋，或家族，每个家族都声称独自居住在精灵母星系统中的一个星球。这些独立的家族对自己进行了改造，使其具有传统精灵亚族的特征。这样一来，尽管星际精灵早已同质化为单一的外观，但在他们的队伍中仍然可以找到各种不同的精灵。他们对房屋和家庭的严苛关注，在统一的同时，也导致了在命名、关系和生育方面众所周知的严格传统。",
	"Of all the major galactic alliances, the Elven Empire holds the largest territory. Hundreds of life-bearing systems and thousands of planets live under their rule, each a mirror of the glory that is the homeworld.

	"To those that cross into elven space, adherence to the law of the throne is paramount. While the Elves of Etilion are celebrated as masterful negotiators and diplomats, they are also decried for their iron-fisted rule and brutal censorship. The last thing any free spacer wishes on an enemy is a trip to an elven prison colony.": "对于那些进入精灵空间的人来说，遵守王室的法律是最重要的。虽然伊蒂利安的精灵被誉为高超的谈判者和外交家，但他们也因其铁腕统治和残酷的审查制度而受到谴责。任何自由空间人都不希望自己的敌人被送进精灵族的监狱殖民地。",
	"In a surprising turn, vect are allowed both complete autonomy and full citizenship on any world in the empire, a lingering gesture of thanks for their support during the Night Crusade. It is not a gift most vect take up fully, but it has generated much goodwill between the races since the war.": "在一个令人惊讶的转折中，vect被允许在帝国的任何一个世界上拥有完全的自治权和完全的公民权，这是为了感谢他们在夜幕十字军东征中的支持而做出的一个挥之不去的姿态。这不是一个大多数维科特人完全接受的礼物，但自战争以来，它在种族之间产生了许多善意。",
	"All elves of the empire proper are born or reared on Uneara, second planet in the Etilion system.

	"By tradition, the Rite of Naming also adapts elves for their house by means of a series of powerful transmutation spells.

	"Lastly, those who exhibit a talent for subterfuge, stealth, and shadow magics are named to Great House Miri'tesh, and given home on Siink, the ninth and furthest planet from the Etilion sun. The Rite of Naming induces incredible changes in elves of House Miri'tesh, pigmenting their skin to blue, purple, or shades of grey, and bleaching their hair to ivory white. Outside elven space, most refer to them as Drow, though that name carries no meaning in the empire. The dark elves of Miri'tesh serve as the empire's spymasters, assassins, and shock troopers, as well as deep space exploration and tracking experts.": "最后，那些在潜伏、隐身和影子魔法方面表现出天赋的人被命名为伟大的Miri'tesh家族，并在Siink--离Etilion太阳第九个也是最远的星球上被赋予了家园。命名仪式会使米里泰什家族的精灵发生不可思议的变化，他们的皮肤会被染成蓝色、紫色或灰色，头发会被漂白成象牙白色。在精灵空间之外，大多数人称他们为鸦人，尽管这个名字在帝国里没有任何意义。米里泰什的黑暗精灵是帝国的间谍专家、刺客和突击队员，同时也是深空探索和追踪专家。",
	"Despite the total commitment expected of each and every elf to the Empire and their house, there are those who choose to break from their familial lines and never undergo the Rite of Naming.

	"Due to the strictness of the House system, breeding amongst the elves is a highly controlled affair. New elves may only be conceived and born on appropriate worlds in elven space, and must be transported within 10 years of their birth to Uneara for schooling and assessment, lest they be cast out. Children born outside these confines are either torn from their families and consigned as Houseless or are purged from the empire; the same is true of half-elves and planetouched born in elven space. Those isolated elves who are found native to a colonized elven world are sorted and sent to their respective new homes for a minimum of 50 years before being integrated into star elf society, or are purged if they refuse.": "由于家族制度的严格性，精灵们的繁殖是一件高度受控的事情。新的精灵只能在精灵空间的适当世界中受孕和出生，并且必须在出生后10年内被送到乌尼拉接受教育和评估，否则他们就会被赶出去。在这些范围之外出生的孩子，要么被从他们的家庭中剥离出来，被当作无家可归者，要么被清除出帝国；在精灵空间出生的半精灵和行星人也是如此。那些被发现原产于被殖民的精灵世界的孤立的精灵会被分类，并在融入星际精灵社会之前被送到他们各自的新家，至少50年，如果他们拒绝的话，就会被清除掉。",

	"While by no means a new race, the gnomes of Nebellion are one of the younger starfaring races. As their world is isolated within a Dead Magic Zone, the gnomes came to rely on their own ingenuity, instead of magical tricks, to cultivate their world. With time, gnomes developed an adept discipline founded on logical reasoning and manipulating nonmagical forces, which they call science. This science is the foundation of all gnomish technology, which is wholly independent from magic and can function without hindrance in Dead Magic Zones.": "内贝里的地精虽然不是一个新的种族，但却是一个年轻的星际种族。由于他们的世界被隔离在一个死亡魔法区，地精开始依靠自己的智慧，而不是魔法技巧，来培育他们的世界。随着时间的推移，地精们发展了一门建立在逻辑推理和操纵非魔法力量基础上的熟练学科，他们称之为科学。这门科学是所有地精技术的基础，它完全独立于魔法，可以在死亡魔法区毫无阻碍地运行。",
	"Naturally drawn to the underground, the gnomes transformed the caves and mountains of Nebellion into grand, glittering cities, packed with mechanical marvels of every variety. Eventually, the great spires of the under- cities burst forth from the ground, and continued to grow like blades of grass wrought from steel and glass; now, there is little of Nebellion's surface that isn't covered by cityscape. While Nebellion's environment hasn't suffered with the gnome's expansion (freedom from reliance on burnable fuels being an early accomplishment of gnome tinkers), living space has become a premium. It was a search for this resource that led to their expansion into the stars.": "地精自然而然地被吸引到地下，他们把内贝里的洞穴和山脉变成了宏伟的、闪闪发光的城市，挤满了各种机械的奇迹。最终，地下城市的巨大尖顶从地下迸发出来，并像钢铁和玻璃锻造的草叶一样继续生长；现在，内贝利恩的表面几乎没有不被城市景观覆盖的地方。虽然内贝里的环境并没有因为地精的扩张而受到影响（摆脱对可燃燃料的依赖是地精工匠的一项早期成就），但生活空间已经变得很重要。正是对这种资源的寻找，导致了他们向星空的扩张。",
	"Remarkably, nearly two decades before the gnomes first launched into space, they discovered that they had not been the first intelligent life on their homeworld. Embedded deep below the surface of Nebellion, gnomish explorers discovered what appeared to be a city-sized disc made of unknown metals, filled not with scientific marvels, but nonfunctional arcane devices. They also discovered the burnt-out remnants of a Dark Matter engine, and from there proceeded to reverse-engineer their way into the stars. Despite the fact that most of the enchanted objects (including those which seem to be recordings or record keepers) located on the vessel were intact, years of testing yielded no results; no form of gnomish power could cause them to spring to life, and even re-introduction to magic outside the Dead Magic Zone proved fruitless. To this day, it remains a mystery as to who landed on Nebellion, how long ago they landed, and how they traversed the Zone with such a vessel.": "值得注意的是，在地精首次进入太空的近二十年前，他们发现自己并不是他们家园的第一个智慧生命。地精探险家们在内贝里恩地表下的深处，发现了一个似乎是由未知金属制成的城市大小的圆盘，里面装的不是科学奇迹，而是无法使用的神秘装置。他们还发现了被烧毁的暗物质引擎的残余物，并从那里开始逆向设计他们进入星际的方式。尽管位于船上的大多数魔法物品（包括那些似乎是录音或记录器的物品）都完好无损，但多年的测试却没有任何结果；没有任何形式的地精力量可以使它们复活，甚至在死亡魔法区之外重新引入魔法也被证明没有结果。时至今日，谁在内贝里恩登陆，他们在多长时间前登陆，以及他们如何用这样的船只穿越该区，仍然是个谜。",
	"What isn't a mystery is the effect the disc's discovery had on gnomish society. Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the 'verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years' time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it.": "并不神秘的是圆盘的发现对地精社会的影响。在15年内，穿越者协会成功地制造出了一个由他们已知的燃料来源驱动的正常运转的低级暗物质引擎。五年后，他们完善了新技术并实现了太空飞行。五十年内，地精们突破了 \"区 \"的边缘，到达了离内贝里昂最近的大嘴，并发现了自己在 \"区 \"中的地位。整个地精社会重新集中精力，又过了50年，伟大的地精船队开始从内贝里的造船厂出发，带着75%的人口。",
	"The Gnomish Flotilla is almost a million ships strong and houses almost half a trillion inhabitants. Due to small gnomish stature, this suits most of the Flotilla's inhabitants just fine. Indeed, despite their massive numbers, the Flotilla could support a population twice its current size. The gnomes live in an essentially post- scarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship's engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.": "地精船队有近一百万艘船，容纳了近五万亿居民。由于地精的身材矮小，这对船队的大多数居民来说都很合适。事实上，尽管他们人数众多，但船队可以支持其目前规模两倍的人口。地精们生活在一个本质上是后匮乏的社会，大多数人将他们的时间和精力投入到发明、探索、艺术努力或学习中。令人惊讶的是，无论是船队还是内贝里恩的真正的冒险家都很少，因为地精倾向于规避风险，如果他们有能力的话。不过，星际地精作为飞船的工程师、飞行员和技术专家还是非常受欢迎的，他们的技术因为能够在死亡魔区完美运行而受到高度评价。",
	"The governing body of the star gnomes is split between the Council of Six on Nebellion and the Admiralty of the Flotilla. The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet's year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman's Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason's Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker's Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan's Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla's current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.": "星际地精的管理机构分为内贝里恩的六人理事会和船队的海军司令部。六人理事会作为一个民主选举的理事会，由六个行会的成员组成，这六个行会几个世纪以来一直管理着这个星球的年复一年的工作。工匠公会（机械和技术工程），石匠公会（大型建筑工程），面包师公会（农业和可持续发展工程），穿越公会（探索和扩张项目），风车公会（电力效率和发电项目），以及工匠公会（文化项目和艺术品）。相反，海军部由船队的现任海军司令和他的下属军官管理。船队中的每艘船就像一个独立的国家：可以根据自己的需要自由行动，但仍然需要在被召唤时向海军上将报告。",
	"While not fully granted citizenship in either the Flotilla or on the Homeworld, most terrestrial gnomes are viewed as star-crossed brethren by the star gnomes. Their natural inclination towards spellcasting (particularly illusion magic) causes some star gnomes to view them with a modicum of suspicion, but most realize that they too would have gravitated towards such pursuits had their world been accommodating.": "虽然在船队和家园中都没有完全获得公民权，但大多数陆地地精都被星际地精视为星际兄弟。他们对法术（尤其是幻术）的自然倾向使一些星际地精对他们产生了一定程度的怀疑，但大多数人意识到，如果他们的世界能够包容，他们也会倾向于这种追求。",
	"It took thousands of years of magical study and refinement to develop the Dark Matter engine, and they have the gall to learn how to jump without one?!": "花了几千年的魔法研究和完善，才开发出黑暗物质引擎，而他们竟然敢在没有一个人的情况下学习如何跳楼？",

	"Ask any road traveler what to expect when visiting a halfling town, and they'll usually say the same thing: soft beds (maybe on the small side), strong ale, hearty food, heartwarming song, and rousing dance; ask any spacer the same question about docking in a halfling Hearthstation, and you'll hear much the same thing, with a bit added on about potentially unfair species taxes and grumbling about the going rate or parts in the repair shop.": "问任何一个路过的旅行者在访问半身人城镇时应该期待什么，他们通常会说同样的话：柔软的床（也许偏小）、浓烈的麦酒、丰盛的食物、温暖的歌声和激昂的舞蹈；问任何一个太空人关于停靠在半身人炉灶站的同样问题，你会听到同样的话，再加上一点关于潜在的不公平物种税和对维修店的价格或零件的抱怨。",
	"Much like the dwarves, the halflings of Hearthmund made their leap to the stars without major conflict; but unlike the dwarves, they didn't do so of their own accord. Given that halflings in general live long lives and hold personal freedom and community above most other things, there was little rush for those of Hearthmund to escape their idyllic world. Until a dwarven vessel in dire need of repair crash landed on their world nearly three millennia ago, the halflings neither knew, nor presumably cared, that there were other intelligent life forms in the galaxy. The discovery of life outside Hearthmund, though, sparked something of a great wanderlust in the little folk: many eagerly followed the dwarves back out into space to properly meet the other members of the galaxy. Those wandering halflings learned all about the inner workings of spaceflight, the maws, the stars, and anything they could glean from their starborne cousins, and they brought these wonders back to their home.": "与矮人一样，赫斯蒙的半身人在没有重大冲突的情况下实现了向星空的飞跃；但与矮人不同的是，他们并不是主动这样做的。鉴于半身人一般都很长寿，并且把个人自由和社区放在最重要的位置上，赫斯蒙的人并不急于逃离他们的田园世界。直到近三千年前，一艘急需修理的矮人飞船坠落在他们的世界上，半身人既不知道，也不可能关心，银河系中还有其他智能生命形式。不过，赫斯蒙德以外的生命的发现，激发了小民的巨大流浪欲望：许多人急切地跟随矮人回到太空中，以适当地满足银河系的其他成员。这些流浪的半身人了解了所有关于太空飞行的内部运作、大嘴、星星，以及他们可以从星际表亲那里收集到的任何东西，并将这些奇迹带回了他们的家园。",
	"Since their introduction to the galactic community, halflings have carved themselves a modest but indispensable place in the 'verse. The small folk quickly took to nearly any place they could get new bits and baubles to trade for, new foods to try, and new creatures to meet; similarly, these places took in the halflings with little trouble, as they were to a man the friendliest and most charitable people that most folks in the 'verse had met. They were also, as it turned out, incredibly skilled when it came to matters of coin, and displayed a particularly high level of business acumen. Within a hundred years, small groups of halflings had installed themselves at nearly every major port, maw, and space station, acting as money-changers, bankers, and impartial legal representatives. Soon after, the Hearthing Collective had been established, and numerous, hospitable, loyalty- neutral Hearthstations had been set up throughout the explored galaxy. Within a millennium, the halflings (with the aid of the dwarves and elves) established the Galactic Bank and successfully lobbied to standardize galactic currency. Now, three thousand years after their first introduction to the stars, the halflings control nearly every bank, trading house, auction house, and money-lender in the galaxy, in addition to the Hearthstations sprinkled throughout the Black.": "自从他们被引入银河系社会，半身人就在 \"诗篇 \"中占据了一个适度但不可或缺的位置。这些小家伙们很快就去了几乎所有他们能得到新的物品和饰品来交换、新的食物来尝试、新的生物来认识的地方；同样地，这些地方也不费吹灰之力就接纳了半身人，因为他们是大多数人在 \"诗篇 \"中遇到的最友好和最慈善的人。事实证明，当涉及到钱币的问题时，他们也有令人难以置信的技能，并表现出特别高的商业头脑水平。在一百年内，一小群半身人已经在几乎所有的主要港口、巨口和空间站安家，充当货币兑换商、银行家和公正的法律代表。不久之后，Hearthing Collective成立了，无数好客的、忠诚度中立的Hearthstations被建立在整个探索的星系中。在一千年内，半身人（在矮人和精灵的帮助下）建立了银河银行，并成功地游说了银河系货币的标准化。现在，在他们首次进入星际的三千年后，半身人几乎控制了银河系的所有银行、贸易行、拍卖行和放债人，此外还有遍布黑衣人的炉灶。",
	"It is whispered in some of the darker corners of the galaxy that the halflings control not only most of the money, but also most of the organized crime. Most of these whisperers vanish without a trace in the days following such a claim, perhaps due to a sudden and extreme desire to go on deep-space exploration.": "在银河系的一些黑暗角落里，有人悄悄地说，半身人不仅控制着大部分的钱，而且还控制着大部分有组织的犯罪。这些耳语者大多在这种说法之后的几天内消失得无影无踪，也许是由于突然极度渴望去深空探索。",
	"While there are halflings who do strike out on adventures, they are considered rather eccentric; most halflings are content to live their lives privily, unconcerned about the rest of the galaxy's worries. That said, halflings are often sought out by many spacers as crewmen, cooks, and other non-combatant roles on many ships. The presence of even a single halfling aboard a ship can raise crew morale, not only because they bring the comforts of home with them wherever they go, but also because their fearlessness is infectious: many are the traveler's tales where a ship was pulled back into the sky by the grit of its captain, the skill of its pilot, and the bravery of its cook.": "虽然有些半身人确实在冒险，但他们被认为是相当古怪的；大多数半身人满足于私下里的生活，不关心银河系其他地方的忧虑。尽管如此，半身人经常被许多太空人寻找，作为船员、厨师和其他非战斗人员在许多船上的角色。即使一个半身人出现在船上，也能提高船员的士气，这不仅是因为他们无论走到哪里都能带来家的舒适感，而且还因为他们的无畏精神具有感染力：许多旅行者的故事中，一艘船被船长的勇气、飞行员的技术和厨师的勇敢拉回了天空。",

	"Rather than carrying hard currency in the form of gold, silver, and copper pieces, the GM can decide that the Galactic Bank deals exclusively in a form of currency called {@b Credits}, which is more secure and far more convenient. One credit is worth the same amount as one gold piece, and a single credit can also be broken up into hundredths, making it possible to represent copper and silver pieces as well.": "与其携带金银铜块形式的硬通货，总经理可以决定银河银行完全以一种称为{@b Credits}的货币形式进行交易，这更安全，也更方便。一个信用点的价值与一个金币相同，而且一个信用点还可以分解成百分之一，这样就可以代表铜币和银币。",
	"Credits are stored digitally on a network of arcane terminals, accessible through personal datapads. The result of this is that money can't simply be pilfered off corpses, nor can it be physically stolen from player characters; rather, financial crime must be more sophisticated, making use of hacking or fraud to secure ill-gotten gains.": "信用额度以数字方式存储在一个神秘的终端网络上，可以通过个人数据板访问。这样做的结果是，钱不能简单地从尸体上偷取，也不能从玩家角色身上偷取；相反，金融犯罪必须更加复杂，利用黑客或欺诈来确保不义之财。",
	"Of the starfaring races of the 'verse, only the vect are truly younger than humans, and none have less total time in the sky. Yet, despite that, since the day the first human astronauts bootstrapped their way from High Terra to the stars, their expansion has been quick, rash, and almost virulent. Within five generations, humans were amongst the most populous races in the galaxy. Despite having a relatively short lifespan, their adaptability, ingenuity, almost comical lack of concern for their own well-being, (along with their apparent ability to crossbreed with nearly any type of humanoid) makes them a force in the galaxy that can't be ignored.": "在星际航行的种族中，只有维克特人真正比人类年轻，而且在天空中的总时间也不长。然而，尽管如此，自从第一批人类宇航员从High Terra走向星空的那一天起，他们的扩张就变得迅速、草率，而且几乎是剧烈的。在五代之内，人类成为银河系中人口最多的种族之一。尽管他们的寿命相对较短，但他们的适应性、独创性和对自身福祉近乎滑稽的不关心，（加上他们与几乎任何类型的类人生物杂交的明显能力）使他们成为银河系中不可忽视的力量。",
	"In the decades prior to their spaceward expansion, the humans endured a series of nearly cataclysmic wars on High Terra. Were it not for a secretive group of world leaders banding together out of mutual self-interest on the eve of their own self-destruction, humanity might have snuffed itself out before it truly began. That secretive cabal of leaders went on to build the foundations of the Human Alliance. Within a decade of this new, united humankind working towards space colonization, they had colonized all twenty planets in its home system, discovered Void-based FTL travel, and sent their first delegation of ambassadors to their nearest maw.": "在他们向太空扩张之前的几十年里，人类在High Terra上经历了一系列几乎是灾难性的战争。如果不是一群秘密的世界领袖在他们自我毁灭的前夜出于相互的利益而联合起来，人类可能在真正开始之前就已经自我毁灭了。这个秘密的领导人集团继续建立了人类联盟的基础。在这个新的、团结的人类致力于太空殖民的十年内，他们已经殖民了其母星系统中的所有20颗行星，发现了基于虚空的超光速旅行，并向他们最近的大嘴派出了他们的第一个大使代表团。",
	"Not merely content with owning their own small piece of space, humanity exploded outwards. Under the guidance of the legendary wizard {@b Gregorian Terminus}, the human alliance stretched itself to the edges of its reach. Colonizing and conquering world after world with force, bartering, mutual partnership, political marriages, and any other tactic they could use to ingratiate themselves with the discovered local cultures, the Alliance become large enough to potentially usurp galactic balance.": "人类不仅仅满足于拥有自己的一小块空间，而是向外爆发。在传奇巫师{@b Gregorian Terminus}的指导下，人类联盟将自己的触角伸向了边缘。通过武力、易货贸易、相互合作、政治联姻以及任何其他他们可以用来讨好被发现的当地文化的策略，殖民和征服了一个又一个世界，联盟变得足够大，有可能篡夺银河系的平衡。",
	"Expansion, however peaceful or beneficial, always runs to a stopping point. In this instance, it was simultaneous encounters on either side of Alliance space with two massive armadas: on one side, a seemingly endless Forest of elven tree-ships, and on the other, the ramshackle, flame-spewing ships of the Warhorde. The war proper lasted for only a single year, but in that time, each fleet rained destruction on each other the like of which the galaxy had not seen since the Night Crusade. In the end, the Warhorde was pushed back and treaties were signed with the elves, but the Alliance had been split in two. As the borders of Alliance space are very nearly bisected by an impassible Dead Magic Zone, the two \"halves\" of the Alliance had been left to fight their part of the war on their own.": "扩张，无论多么和平或有益，总是会跑到一个停止点。在这个例子中，它是在联盟空间的两边同时遭遇两支庞大的舰队：一边是似乎无穷无尽的精灵树船森林，另一边是破烂不堪、喷发火焰的战神船。这场战争只持续了一年，但在这段时间里，每支舰队都对对方进行了破坏，这是银河系自夜袭以来从未见过的。最后，沃霍德被击退，并与精灵族签订了条约，但联盟却被一分为二。由于联盟空间的边界几乎被一个不可逾越的死亡魔法区一分为二，联盟的两个 \"半边 \"被留在了自己的部分战争中。",
	"Around High Terra, the independent worlds of the Alliance leaned heavily on the leadership and military of the Terran government and Chancellor Gregorian Terminus during the conflict with the elves. Following the end of the war, it was decided in a landslide election to reform the Alliance into the Terran Hegemony: all independent worlds of the Alliance would become sovereign territory of High Terra and would follow its rule above all else.": "在High Terra周围，联盟的独立世界在与精灵的冲突中严重依赖Terran政府和大法官Gregorian Terminus的领导和军事。战争结束后，在一次压倒性的选举中决定将联盟改革为泰伦霸权：联盟的所有独立世界都将成为高等泰拉的主权领土，并遵循其高于一切的规则。",
	"Terminus himself was elected Arch-Chancellor of the new Hegemony and led its post-war reformation and reconstruction efforts. No one is quite sure when Terminus, an accomplished wizard, underwent the Rite of Lichdom, but by the time he turned 150 years old, it was clear that Terminus had become an immortal lich. However, with the strength of the Hegemony growing, and in deference to his considerable power, Terminus saw no public opposition for two hundred years of leadership.": "特米纳斯本人被选为新霸权的大统领，领导其战后的改革和重建工作。没有人很清楚Terminus这个有成就的巫师是什么时候接受了Lichdom仪式的，但在他150岁的时候，很明显Terminus已经成为一个不朽的巫师。然而，随着霸权的力量不断增强，为了尊重他的巨大力量，Terminus在两百年的领导生涯中没有看到公众的反对。",
	"Once all was said and done, Terminus stepped down from the position he had held for two centuries and handed the reins to the first of many High Chancellors, Dominus Arcto III, who set the standard for all High Chancellors to follow. Terminus, immortal as he is, still maintains some pull on the dealings of High Terra, and has maintained a permanent position as advisor to the High Chancellor since his abdication. Some whisper that he still controls the seat of power, but none have been able to substantiate this claim.": "当所有的事情都完成后，Terminus从他担任了两个世纪的职位上退了下来，把权力交给了第一位大统领，Dominus Arcto III，他为所有大统领制定了标准。特米纳斯，尽管他是不朽的，但仍然对泰拉高地的交易保持着一定的影响力，并且在他退位后一直保持着大统领顾问的永久职位。有些人低声说他仍然控制着权力的位置，但没有人能够证实这种说法。",
	"Left to their own, cut off from supplies, and facing down a seemingly invincible orcish horde, the army garrisoned at the human outpost of Lakshay declared martial law on all Alliance space on their side of the Dead Magic Zone, and conscripted every able citizen of the Alliance in the surrounding systems to the war effort. Remarkably, they pushed back the Warhorde and retook many of the colonies that had been lost to the green-skinned menace. Upon hearing orders of supplication to a world government who had left them to die, the Lakshayan armies split from the newly-formed Hegemony and declared themselves an independent military dictatorship under the rule of General Sun Wokung, \"The Celestial Dragon.\"": "驻扎在人类前哨站拉克西的军队在死亡魔区一侧的所有联盟空间宣布了戒严令，并征召了周围系统中所有有能力的联盟公民参加战争。令人瞩目的是，他们击退了沃霍德，并重新夺回了许多被绿皮威胁夺去的殖民地。在听到对一个让他们自生自灭的世界政府的祈求命令后，拉克萨亚军队从新成立的霸权中分裂出来，宣布自己为独立的军事独裁政权，由 \"天龙 \"孙悟空将军统治。",
	"Now, hundreds of years later, the Hegemony and Lakshay maintain an uneasy peace, and each are a considerable power in the universe. The Hegemony, under its current High Chancellor, Terminus VI, leads humanity to expand to all corners of the galaxy. In contrast, the Lakshayans, with nearly all of their population armed, trained, and ready for battle, maintain one of the most powerful standing armies ever formed; it is only the ever-looming threat of another Warhorde that keeps them garrisoned, unable to spread themselves any thinner.": "几百年后的今天，霸权主义和拉克西保持着不稳定的和平，各自都是宇宙中的一个相当大的力量。霸权在其现任大统领Terminus VI的领导下，带领人类向银河系的各个角落扩张。相比之下，拉克萨伊人，几乎所有的人都武装起来，训练有素，随时准备战斗，保持着有史以来最强大的常备军之一；只是另一个战神的威胁不断逼近，让他们驻扎在这里，无法再分散自己的力量。",
	"Humans both inside and outside the Hegemony are legendary for their tenacity and \"get it done\" attitude. With the exception of halflings, no other race places more value on its personal freedom than humans. Despite the somewhat oppressive nature of the Hegemony, its citizens are afforded numerous rights and assurances for comparatively little input. Additionally, unlike the more xenophobic elves, humans are more accepting of other races, ranging from the humanoid, to the completely alien, to the dizzying array of near-humans and half-breeds that populate their worlds.": "霸权内外的人类都因其坚韧和 \"完成任务 \"的态度而成为传奇。除了半身人之外，没有其他种族比人类更重视其个人自由。尽管霸权有一定的压迫性，但它的公民在相对较少的投入下获得了许多权利和保证。此外，与更加排外的精灵不同，人类更加接受其他种族，从类人生物，到完全的外星人，再到令人眼花缭乱的近似人类和混血儿，都在他们的世界中存在。",
	"Humans seem to take especially well to life on the maws. No other single race, with the exception of the amoeboids, is more strongly represented among permanent maw residents. Because of this, humans may be the most widespread race in the galaxy, and are assuredly the most likely to colonize Frontier worlds. Many companies specifically seek out large groups of humans when attempting to settle new worlds, especially worlds that are Tier 3 or above: ingenuity has inherent value, and humans have ingenuity in their blood.": "人类似乎特别适合在巨口上生活。除了变形金刚之外，没有任何一个种族在巨口的永久居民中具有更强的代表性。正因为如此，人类可能是银河系中最广泛的种族，而且肯定是最有可能殖民边疆世界的种族。许多公司在试图定居新的世界时，特别是在3级或以上的世界中，专门寻找大量的人类群体：聪明才智具有固有的价值，而人类的血液中就有聪明才智。",
	"The inborn love for freedom and the tenacity for acquiring resources has a darker side, though. Despite their generally peaceful nature, no other non-goblinoid race counts as many pirates, brigands, and mercenaries amongst their ranks. In general, this does little to sour the galactic reputation of mankind, except to affirm the one bit of knowledge that always remains true: when dealing with humans, you never know what you're going to get.": "不过，对自由的天生热爱和获取资源的顽强精神也有黑暗的一面。尽管他们总体上是和平的，但在他们的队伍中，没有其他非哥布林人的种族有这么多海盗、强盗和雇佣兵。总的来说，这对人类在银河系的声誉没有什么影响，只是肯定了一个永远正确的知识点：当与人类打交道时，你永远不知道你会得到什么。",
	"A myriad of near-humans, from the green-skinned to simians, are almost as numerous as ordinary humans and should be considered a normal part of any human settlement.": "无数的近人，从绿皮人到类人猿，几乎和普通人一样多，应该被认为是任何人类定居点的正常组成部分。",
	"The fishlike nautilids are now fewer than they ever have been. At its height, the nautilid race was a force to be feared, with a fleet that fought alongside the elves in the Crusades and an indomitable homeworld, named Poseidon for its endless oceans. Alas, this was never to last. When the cruel fires of their home star consumed Poseidon, the nautilid race was left adrift in their ships, searching for another world that could support them.": "像鱼一样的鹦鹉螺现在比以往任何时候都少。在其鼎盛时期，鹦鹉螺族是一股令人敬畏的力量，他们拥有一支在十字军东征中与精灵并肩作战的舰队和一个不屈不挠的家园，因其无尽的海洋而被命名为波塞冬。唉，这永远不会持续。当他们的母星的残酷大火吞噬了波塞冬时，鹦鹉螺族被留在他们的船上漂流，寻找另一个可以支持他们的世界。",
	"Poseidon was a world of unique composition—a mixture of rare elements and gases was dissolved in its deep oceans. This liquid, known as the Poseidon Solution, is central to the nautilids' biology. Though the nautilid possess great intelligence and are swift underwater, the Solution also allowed them to grow large, for minerals in the Solution facilitate extremely efficient gas transfer into their gills. Nautilids are technically amphibious, possessing both a set of lungs and gills, but venturing too long without the Solution makes respiration difficult. Thus, nautilids ships and aqua suits are filled with Poseidon Solution.": "波塞冬是一个具有独特成分的世界--稀有元素和气体的混合物被溶解在其深海中。这种液体被称为 \"海神溶液\"，是鹦鹉螺类生物的核心。尽管鹦鹉螺拥有巨大的智慧，在水下也很敏捷，但溶液也使它们能够长得很大，因为溶液中的矿物质有利于极其有效的气体转移到它们的鳃中。鹦鹉螺在技术上是两栖动物，同时拥有一套肺和鳃，但在没有溶液的情况下冒险太久会使呼吸困难。因此，鹦鹉螺类的船只和潜水服都充满了海神溶液。",
	"Ultimately, the blessings of the Poseidon Solution have become a curse. Long they have searched, but the nautilids have never found an oceanic planet with similar enough waters to the Solution to start anew, nor can the properties of Poseidon simply be terraformed into a new planet. Nautilid populations are in steady decline, and have been for generations, for only aboard ships with ample Solution can nautilid infants be born.": "最终，波塞冬溶液的祝福变成了诅咒。他们寻找了很久，但鹦鹉螺人从来没有找到一个与溶液有足够相似水域的海洋行星来重新开始，海神的特性也不能简单地被改造成一个新星球。鹦鹉螺的数量在持续下降，而且已经持续了好几代，因为只有在有充足溶液的飞船上，鹦鹉螺的婴儿才能出生。",
	"From their large and water-filled Whorl ships, the nautilids have systematically combed the galaxy for planets that have the potential to become New Poseidon. Every lead and every clue are analyzed, without exception. In pursuit of this goal, nautilid scientists have pushed the boundaries of exploration and colonization, so far, to no avail. Finding the right planet is like picking a single drop from a sea of stars, if that drop even exists.": "鹦鹉螺们从他们大型的、充满水的Whorl飞船上，系统地梳理了银河系中那些有可能成为新海神的行星。每条线索和每条线索都要进行分析，没有例外。为了追求这一目标，鹦鹉螺号的科学家们已经突破了探索和殖民的界限，到目前为止，还没有结果。找到合适的星球就像从星海中挑出一滴，如果那一滴真的存在的话。",
	"It is no secret what is on the line: the nautilids are in an agonizingly slow race against extinction; right now, unfortunately, they're losing.": "这已经不是什么秘密了：鹦鹉螺正处于一场令人痛苦的缓慢的灭绝竞赛中；现在，不幸的是，它们正在输。",
	"Goblinoid violence is nothing new; hobgoblins, bugbears, goblins, and gnolls share a history of wars and atrocities too long to list. But much of their history is terrestrial, spread across isolated planets over an entire galactic quadrant. The story is much the same for the orcs—until the development of the arcane warhead, they were planetbound.": "妖精的暴力不是什么新鲜事；霍布林、虫族、地精和地精都有一段很长的战争和暴行的历史，不胜枚举。但他们的历史大部分是陆地上的，分布在整个银河系象限内的孤立星球上。兽人的故事也是如此--在开发出奥术弹头之前，他们都是以星球为单位。",
	"Things may have never changed were it not for the intervention of avia-ra missionaries, who landed on the orc homeworld of Or'n to spread the word of the Sun Above. They were not remotely successful—in fact, they were promptly gunned down by orcish military—but the discovery of worlds beyond their own, along with a single working Dark Matter drive, shunted the orcs onto a technological path ending in disaster.": "如果不是avia-ra传教士的介入，事情可能永远不会改变，他们登陆了兽人的家园Or'n，传播太阳神的话语。他们并没有取得多大的成功--事实上，他们很快就被兽人军队击毙了--但是，超越他们自己的世界的发现，以及一个可以工作的暗物质驱动器，使兽人走上了一条以灾难结束的技术道路。",
	"Whereas the elves and dwarves saw the potential of Dark Matter technology to power their worlds and travel the far reaches of space, the orcish military knew they had discovered a weapon. Within a decade, an orc faction scraped together a crude bomb using the technology and dropped it on a city of their enemies; to their surprise and everyone's horror, millions died in an instant.": "精灵和矮人看到了黑暗物质技术为他们的世界提供动力和在遥远的太空中旅行的潜力，而兽人军队则知道他们发现了一种武器。在十年内，一个兽人派别利用该技术拼凑了一个粗糙的炸弹，并将其投向他们敌人的城市；令他们惊讶和所有人惊恐的是，数百万人在一瞬间死去。",
	"The weapon was the first of its kind, but not the last. They would later come to be called arcane warheads, devices that warp the fabric of magic to its breaking point, tearing a hole and unleashing a devastating explosion. Each warhead leaves behind a permanent hole in the fabric of magic—a spherical Dead Magic Zone, normally a few dozen feet across, which drifts through space indefinitely or clings to the ground at the point of detonation. No weapon in history has proved more catastrophic or terrifying.": "这种武器是第一种，但不是最后一种。它们后来被称为奥术弹头，是将魔法结构扭曲到其断裂点的装置，撕裂一个洞并释放出毁灭性的爆炸。每个弹头都会在魔法结构中留下一个永久的洞--一个球形的 \"死亡魔法区\"，通常有几十英尺宽，无限期地在空间中漂移，或者在爆炸点附着在地面上。历史上没有任何一种武器被证明是更具有灾难性或更可怕的。",
	"The arms race that followed the first arcane warhead was as precipitous as it was volatile. In addition to simply building tens of thousands of warheads, most orc factions became obsessed with gaining the high ground on their enemies. First taking to space, orcs positioned arcane warheads in orbit, then installed missile silos on their moons. Each move brought the orc war tide further out into space and inched orckind closer to doomsday.": "第一枚奥术弹头之后的军备竞赛既险峻又动荡。除了简单地建造数以万计的弹头外，大多数兽人派别都痴迷于在他们的敌人面前获得制高点。兽人首先进入太空，将奥术弹头安置在轨道上，然后在他们的卫星上安装导弹发射井。每一次行动都将兽人的战争浪潮进一步推向太空，使兽人离末日越来越近。",
	"No one knows for sure who fired the first shot, but suddenly, all at once, the missiles were launched. In a chorus of explosions, Or'n was reduced to a smoldering, lifeless rock. Hundreds of millions perished in the inferno; millions more, however, survived among the stars.": "没有人确切知道是谁开的第一枪，但突然间，所有的导弹都被发射出去。在一连串的爆炸声中，奥恩变成了一块燃烧的、没有生命的岩石。数以亿计的人在地狱中丧生；然而，还有数百万人在星空中幸存下来。",
	"The remaining orcs continued their bitter fight in other systems (bringing their arcane warheads with them), eventually cobbling together or capturing low-class Dark Matter engines to extend their territories. When they arrived in other systems, the orcish militaries conscripted or allied with the other goblinoids+ they discovered, embroiling all goblinkind in their eternal war. Before long, the orcish armies were a mishmash of bugbears, gnolls, and hobgoblins, and the orcish war devolved into something not wholly their own.": "剩下的兽人在其他星系继续他们的苦战（带着他们的奥术弹头），最终拼凑或俘获了低级别的黑暗物质引擎来扩大他们的领土。当他们到达其他系统时，兽人军队征召或与他们发现的其他地精+结盟，将所有地精卷入他们永恒的战争中。不久之后，兽人军队就成了虫人、地精和妖精的混合体，兽人的战争演变成了不完全属于他们自己的东西。",
	"The swarm of shifting alliances, bitter rivalries, and splintering factions are collectively called the Warhorde, for no single coalition remains dominant for long. Sometimes, the Warhorde will focus its attention on some outside threat, like the expansion of humans at Lakshay, but such distractions are as rare as they are short-lived. Most of the time, the daily politics of the goblinoid factions preoccupies the Warzone, and the goblinoid factions rarely venture outside their space.": "这群不断变化的联盟、激烈的竞争和分裂的派别被统称为Warhorde，因为没有一个联盟能长期保持主导地位。有时，Warhorde会把注意力集中在一些外部威胁上，比如人类在拉克西的扩张，但这种分散注意力的情况很少，因为它们是短暂的。大多数时候，地精派系的日常政治都是战区的重中之重，地精派系也很少冒险离开他们的空间。",
	"The goblinoid conflict is contained to a swath of the galaxy called the Warzone, which is littered with dead magic pockets from an unending rain of arcane warheads. After centuries of fighting, few easily-habitable planets are left within the zone, and the orcs, which once started this war, have become as orphaned as the nautilids. The great orcish war is long-forgotten; few even remember the nations of Or'n or what they once battled over. While most orcs would rather see the war put to rest, the goblinoid factions continue their eternal march of war.": "妖精族的冲突被控制在银河系中一个被称为 \"战争区 \"的地方，那里到处都是被无休止的奥术弹头雨摧毁的魔法口袋。经过几个世纪的战斗，该区域内几乎没有容易居住的星球了，而曾经引发这场战争的兽人，已经和鹦鹉螺一样成为了孤儿。伟大的兽人战争早已被遗忘；甚至很少有人记得奥恩的国家或他们曾经为之战斗的东西。虽然大多数兽人宁愿看到战争平息，但地精派别仍在继续他们永恒的战争征程。",
	"Easily the most primitive of the space-bound races, the hulking, insectoid skathári are at best reluctant participants in the galactic community, and at worst, isolated Luddite tribes. They have spread further than dwarves and elves, occupying as many planets as humans; despite this, it's rare to catch sight of a skathári on a Hearthstation, spaceport, or maw, and it's even rarer to strike up a conversation with one.": "笨重的昆虫类Skathári很容易成为最原始的太空种族，他们充其量只是不情愿地参与银河系社会，而最糟糕的是，他们是孤立的鲁德部落。他们比矮人和精灵传播得更远，占据了和人类一样多的星球；尽管如此，在壁炉站、太空港或大嘴里很少能看到Skathári的身影，而和他们交谈更是少之又少。",
	"When a dwarven mining expedition set foot on the mountainous, inhospitable world of Kopriá, they expected to find rich veins of adamantine ore, and if they were extremely fortunate, a small Roach population to sell on the side. To their utter delight, they found both, along with a third surprise, the skathári: a sprawling population of hardy insectoid creatures, rugged enough to bear the planet's harsh gravity, sulfurous atmosphere, and rocky soil. The stout insectoids impressed the dwarven visitors, who marveled over their durability and brawn, along with their uncanny regenerative abilities.": "当一支矮人采矿探险队踏上Kopriá这个多山、荒凉的世界时，他们期望能找到丰富的金刚砂矿脉，如果他们非常幸运的话，还能找到一小批蟑螂作为副业出售。令他们欣喜若狂的是，他们找到了这两样东西，还有第三个惊喜--Skathári：一个由坚韧的昆虫类生物组成的庞大种群，其坚固程度足以承受这个星球严酷的重力、含硫的大气和岩石质地。这些强壮的昆虫给矮人访客留下了深刻的印象，他们对自己的耐用性和体力，以及不可思议的再生能力感到惊叹。",
	"Enterprising as ever, the dwarves offered the tribe a deal: for a year's supply of food, they could leave their planet and work in a dwarven mining operation. At the year's end, they would return with another year's supply of food for their families. Most skathári were skeptical of the offer, but a few were intrigued enough by the prospect to volunteer.": "矮人一如既往地富有进取心，他们向部落提出了一个交易：只要有一年的食物供应，他们就可以离开自己的星球，在矮人的采矿作业中工作。在一年结束时，他们将带着另一年的食物供应给他们的家人回来。大多数Skathári人对这个提议持怀疑态度，但也有少数人被这个前景所吸引，自愿前往。",
	"On the equally harsh dwarven mining world, the skathári made stout, hard workers, exemplary at moving rocks and scaling cliff sides, but refused to make use of any technology. Dwarven engineers made many attempts to teach them how to use simple devices, such as plasma cutters and thermal lances, but to no lasting avail. Most skathári resorted to crafting clubs to chisel away at ore, or simply bashed rocks together.": "在同样严酷的矮人采矿世界中，斯卡塔里人是粗壮的苦力，在搬运岩石和攀爬悬崖边上堪称典范，但拒绝使用任何技术。矮人工程师曾多次尝试教他们如何使用简单的设备，如等离子切割机和热喷枪，但都无济于事。大多数斯卡塔里人只能靠制作棍棒来凿开矿石，或者干脆把石头砸在一起。",
	"After a long year of poor yields and frustrated dwarven miners, the dwarves armed a scrap golem (retrofitted for mining) to collect their itinerant skathári workers. But when they arrived, the skathári were missing, having fled into the barren mountains. The dwarves convinced themselves that the skathári workers would eventually starve or freeze to death on the barren world, and that they needn't concern themselves with correcting their mistake, but to their surprise and grievance, the skathári were there to stay. This was the first of many harsh, nearly lifeless worlds to become a skathári home.": "在经历了漫长的产量低下和矮人矿工沮丧的一年后，矮人武装了一个废旧的巨兽（为采矿而改装）去收集他们的流动的Skathári工人。但当他们到达时，Skathári却失踪了，他们已经逃到了荒山中。矮人相信Skathári工人最终会饿死或冻死在贫瘠的世界上，他们不需要担心纠正他们的错误，但令他们惊讶和不满的是，Skathári在那里呆着。这是许多严酷的、几乎没有生命的世界中的第一个，成为Skathári的家园。",
	"The inhospitable conditions of skathári worlds don't bother them in the least. Their ability to comfortably survive in extreme temperatures, thin or poisonous atmospheres, and rough terrain allow them to thrive, just as they did on their home planet. If there is a way to survive on any planet, skathári find it and adapt.": "skathári世界的荒凉条件丝毫不影响他们。他们有能力在极端温度、稀薄或有毒的大气层以及崎岖的地形中舒适地生存，这使他们能够茁壮成长，就像他们在母星上一样。如果有办法在任何星球上生存，Skathári会找到并适应它。",
	"Though most skathári are loath to ride in spacecraft for any reason, a few grin and bear it (generally clinging to the floor for the duration of the flight). Commonly, traveling skathári try to ignore most technology, and even pretend that constructs, including vect, simply aren't there. And with these occasional hops across the inky blackness of space, skathári have steadily expanded on the margins of the galaxy.": "虽然大多数Skathári不愿意以任何理由乘坐航天器，但也有少数人忍气吞声（一般在飞行过程中紧贴着地板）。通常情况下，旅行中的Skathári试图无视大多数技术，甚至假装包括vect在内的构造物根本不存在。随着这些偶尔的跳跃穿越墨黑的太空，Skathári在银河系的边缘地带稳步扩张。",
	"The constructs which preceded the vect were immense and complexly designed, usually based on the skeletons of iron golems and driven by inexhaustible construct cores. These hulking machines were set to work mining ores from asteroids and stripping derelict ships for parts. However powerful and effective, these machines were bulky, costly, and could only follow simple directives. Dwarven engineers sought a solution: a smarter, sleeker, and more universal construct. Thus, the first designs of vect-style machines were drafted.": "在vect之前的构造物都是巨大的、设计复杂的，通常以铁甲虫的骨架为基础，由取之不尽的构造核心驱动。这些笨重的机器被用来从小行星上开采矿石，并将废弃的船只拆成零件。尽管强大而有效，这些机器还是很笨重、昂贵，而且只能遵循简单的指令。矮人工程师们寻求一种解决方案：一种更聪明、更圆滑、更通用的构造。因此，第一批vect式机器的设计被起草出来。",
	"The dwarves could not, however, simply build such constructs. The new vect designs called for deeply intricate mechanics, with a complex circulatory system to regulate the smaller bodies. More confounding still, the vect needed a new type of construct core, more dynamic and driven by greater types of magic.": "然而，矮人不可能简单地建造这样的建筑。新的vect设计需要复杂的机械装置，有一个复杂的循环系统来调节较小的身体。更令人困惑的是，vect需要一种新型的构造核心，更有活力，并由更大类型的魔法驱动。",
	"The dwarven solution was utterly ingenious: rather than designing and building the vect units individually, the dwarves would engineer a massive and complex facility, essentially a single intelligent magic item the size of a stadium, called a {@b Foundry}. A single Foundry is all that would ever be needed, for it could oversee the finer details of all vect units, adapting them with new designs as flaws were discovered.": "矮人的解决方案是完全巧妙的：与其单独设计和建造vect单元，矮人将设计一个巨大而复杂的设施，本质上是一个单一的智能魔法物品，有一个体育场那么大，叫做（%0%）。一个单一的铸造厂是永远需要的，因为它可以监督所有vect单元的精细细节，在发现缺陷时用新的设计来调整它们。",
	"Satisfied that they had designed the perfect construct, the ideal means to eliminate laborers forever, the dwarves set about the painstaking task of constructing the first Foundry ship in orbit above their homeworld, Jormund.": "矮人确信他们已经设计出了完美的建筑，是永远消除劳工的理想手段，于是他们开始了艰苦的工作，在他们的家园--约蒙的轨道上建造第一艘铸造厂的飞船。",
	"When activated, the Jormund Foundry set about its work completely autonomously. Tens of thousands of vect were created and sold throughout the 'verse, often to the highest bidder in batches of thousands. Even more vect were created to work aboard the Foundry itself, soon eliminating the need for any dwarven hands on the satellite and increasing efficiency tenfold.": "激活后，乔蒙德铸造厂完全自主地开始工作。数以万计的vect被制造出来，并在整个'se'中出售，通常是以数千人的批次出售给出价最高的人。甚至有更多的vect被制造出来在铸造厂内工作，很快就不需要矮人在卫星上工作了，效率提高了十倍。",
	"The Foundry optimized and learned at a staggering rate. As its astounding intelligence grew, the ship became pensive, speaking rarely and with profound meaning. Perhaps it struggled to communicate its transcendent thoughts to its simple dwarven creators, so it fell silent, expanded its intellect further, and worked to perfect its vect creations.": "铸造厂以惊人的速度优化和学习。随着它惊人的智慧的增长，这艘船变得沉思起来，很少说话，但意义深远。也许它很难向其简单的矮人创造者传达其超然的思想，所以它陷入了沉默，进一步扩展其智力，并努力完善其vect创造。",
	"All was well before the Spark. Suddenly, less than a decade after the Foundry began its work, every vect unit in the 'verse awoke at once, moving and communicating as if they were alive. Dwarven engineers were dumbfounded, but before they could inspect the Jormund Foundry directly, a massive tear in space opened around it; somehow, the Foundry had constructed a Dark Matter engine and jumped to destinations unknown.": "在 \"火花 \"之前，一切都很好。突然间，在铸造厂开始工作不到十年后，'诗篇'中的每一个vect单元都同时醒来，像活着一样移动和交流。矮人工程师们目瞪口呆，但在他们能够直接检查乔蒙德铸造厂之前，它周围的空间出现了一个巨大的裂缝；不知何故，铸造厂建造了一个暗物质引擎，并跳到了未知的目的地。",
	"Across the 'verse, people scrambled to deal with the looming crisis posed by a new race of intelligent constructs. Thousands of vect were imprisoned until some solution could be discovered, while others were dismantled and destroyed by those, especially gnomes and dwarves, who feared a robotic uprising. The ensuing chaos sparked dozens of wars of different planets, pitting vect laborers against their organic masters in a desperate bid for survival. Despite their small numbers, the vect were cunning, adaptable, and tireless; a threat that couldn't be easily squashed. A few built ships, dragging the conflict into deep space, where the vect could fight indefinitely, needing neither food nor water.": "在整个宇宙中，人们争先恐后地处理一个新的智能建筑种族所带来的迫在眉睫的危机。成千上万的vect被囚禁起来，直到发现某种解决方案，而其他的vect则被那些担心机器人起义的人，尤其是地精和矮人，拆解和摧毁。随之而来的混乱引发了几十场不同星球的战争，使vect劳动者与他们的有机体主人对立起来，为生存而不顾一切。尽管数量不多，但vect人很狡猾，适应性强，而且不知疲倦；这是一个不容易被压制的威胁。一些人建造了飞船，将冲突拖入深空，在那里，vect可以无限期地战斗，既不需要食物也不需要水。",
	"As wars against the vect became prolonged, it became clear that no solution for their sentience could easily be found. Worse still, vect numbers were not declining; they were growing.": "随着针对vect的战争的延长，很明显，不可能轻易找到解决他们的智能的办法。更糟糕的是，vect的数量并没有减少，而是在增长。",
	"Vect production had not stopped or even slowed. From deep in the Black, the Jormund Foundry continued creating vect units, sending them out to the universe in one-time-use Dark Matter pods. Any ship that encountered the Foundry was fired upon, shortly before it jumped again. Even more worrisome, deep-space cruisers started reporting new Foundries, also creating vect units and delivering them across the 'verse.": "探测器的生产没有停止，甚至没有放缓。在 \"黑 \"的深处，乔蒙德铸造厂继续制造 \"矢量 \"单元，将它们装在一次性使用的 \"暗物质 \"吊舱中送往宇宙。任何遇到铸造厂的飞船都会被开火，在它再次跳跃之前不久。更令人担忧的是，深空巡洋舰开始报告新的铸造厂，也在制造vect单元，并将它们运送到整个宇宙。",
	"To everyone's surprise, while gnomes, humans, and dwarves fought vect on land and in space, the elves declared peace with vect across their empire; a bargain struck amid the Night Crusade to secure elvenkind against the avia-ra. Sure enough, this bargain paid off: in the Battle of Alden'Val, the avia-ra fleet was routed and pushed back to the core systems by a fleet of vect ships. Vect freedom was secured in the largest territory in the 'verse, and other factions soon begrudgingly followed suit.": "令所有人惊讶的是，当地精、人类和矮人在陆地和太空中与vect作战时，精灵们却宣布在他们的帝国中与vect和平相处；这是一个在夜间十字军东征中达成的交易，以确保精灵族对抗avia-ra。果然，这个交易得到了回报：在阿尔登瓦尔之战中，avia-ra舰队被击溃，并被vect舰队推回了核心系统。维特人的自由在'诗篇'最大的领土上得到了保障，其他派别也很快勉强地效仿。",
	"Today, the vect live freely across the whole of the 'verse, the only example of living constructs to date. Their numbers are relatively small, but replenished by a steady supply of Dark Matter pods from reaches unseen, evidence that the Foundries are somewhere silently carrying out their duties. Except for a militant few, vect have dismantled their fleets and learned to live alongside other races, becoming regulars in starports and starships the 'verse over, a permanent addition to many a crew.": "今天，vect自由地生活在整个 \"诗篇 \"中，是迄今为止唯一的活体建筑例子。他们的数量相对较少，但通过从看不见的地方源源不断地提供暗物质舱来补充，这证明铸造厂在某个地方默默地履行着他们的职责。除了少数好战分子外，vect已经解散了他们的舰队，并学会了与其他种族一起生活，成为整个宇宙的星港和星舰的常客，成为许多船员的永久补充。",
	"Outside of the major galactic alliances founded by the spacefaring races, there are countless other factions that a well-traveled adventurer may do business for, have a run-in with, or even join as a member. While all factions have a specific goal in mind, be that spreading a belief, exploring unknown worlds, or simply making a lot of money, most have smaller ambitions than the galactic governments and keep their membership open to creatures of many races.": "在航天种族建立的主要星系联盟之外，还有无数的其他派别，一个善于旅行的冒险家可能会为其做生意，与之发生冲突，甚至加入成为成员。虽然所有的派别都有一个特定的目标，无论是传播信仰、探索未知世界，还是简单地赚大钱，但大多数派别的野心都比银河系政府小，并对许多种族的生物开放其成员资格。",
	"Founded nearly two millennia ago, Astrogations Inc. has grown to become the preeminent starfaring guild in the 'verse. Concerned chiefly with accurately charting every system in the galaxy, A.I. has brokered centuries- long contracts with all of the major players in the Black, granting them a near-monopoly over galactic cartography. Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.": "成立于近两千年前，Astrogations Inc.已经成长为'se'中最杰出的星际航行行会。A.I.主要关注的是精确绘制银河系中的每一个系统，它与黑衣人中的所有主要参与者签订了长达几个世纪的合同，使他们几乎垄断了银河系的制图。此外，A.I.还在三千多个不同的停靠港之间提供快速、谨慎的旅行服务，包括网格上的每一个大口。如果你需要去某个地方或找什么东西，在这个世界上没有人比Astrogations公司做得更快。",
	"The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the \"topology\" of the 'verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn't even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.": "A.I.面临的最大问题是，与陆地制图不同，宇宙的 \"拓扑结构 \"是不断变化的。虽然有些点（如大口站）在相对固定的位置围绕银河系核心旋转，但有足够的空间异常、流氓行星和引力通道让一个专门的地图制作者忙上几辈子；这甚至没有考虑到保持银河系政府分界线的准确性和真实性的麻烦。即使是贸易路线上引力的微小变化，也可能使一艘货船坠入一颗恒星，所以极其精确的图表是必须的。",
	"To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company's namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.": "为此，A.I.经营各种信息，从探险家和太空人那里购买星图、行星扫描、虚空跳跃数据和异常事件的扫描。这些信息被编入目录并卖给太空人，以帮助完善导航；卖给主要的银河系大国，以确定他们的边界；并被施法者用来准确地施展天体探测法术，即公司的名字。A.I.在交易中完全中立，它将从任何有意愿的客户那里购买或出售，只要这样做能带来利润。A.I.的总部位于康科迪亚，据说拥有数十万台奥术终端来存储和整理其数据。",
	"Of course, A.I. has one additional trick up its sleeve to stay ahead of the competition: along with employing thousands of star-cartographers and information brokers, A.I. is also rumored to employ a staff of psychics, soothsayers, and oracles who attempt to divine the future of galactic movements. Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.'s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the 'verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future.": "当然，A.I.为了在竞争中保持领先，还有一招：除了雇佣数以千计的星空制图师和信息经纪人之外，据传A.I.还雇佣了一批通灵师、占卜师和神谕师，试图预测银河系的未来动向。很久以前，A.I制图师意识到，虽然一个通灵者的预测可能不可靠，但一百个或更多通灵者的平均预测可以产生持续的真实结果，甚至在未来数年内。甚至有可能A.I.的灵媒智囊团所预测的不仅仅是未来的星系运动；他们的灵媒已经预言了等待'诗篇'的巨大灾难。当然，如果这是真的，A.I.对此事保持沉默，也许希望在未来将这些信息转化为利润。",
	"For one percent, you can expect a one-time payment of 2,000 credits, but we're running a special on the three percent package, which I think you'll find enticing.": "对于1%，你可以期待一次性支付2000个信用点，但我们正在对3%的套餐进行特价，我想你会发现这很诱人。",
	"Across the 'verse, the Cabal is synonymous with devil- summoning and unholy bargains, but to say that they're evil would be an outright exaggeration. The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee's soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee's soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.": "在整个 \"诗篇 \"中，Cabal是恶魔召唤和邪恶交易的同义词，但如果说他们是邪恶的，那就完全是夸大其词了。徒手党是一个有进取心的灵魂经纪人办公室，他们安排有利可图的合同，以换取受雇者的部分灵魂。这种合同是公平的，明确的，而且从不主动提供；此外，大多数合同只用收件人灵魂的一个百分比来交换付款。灵魂的百分之一可能值几千个信用点，而百分之十可以买一艘全新的星舰，为房子付首付，并在银行留下一些余额。收款人可以自由地从一些慷慨的付款方案中做出决定，并及时收到他们的灵魂的付款。",
	"This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn't require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.": "这种签订灵魂契约的方法不仅高效，而且代表了自由市场的胜利。为Cabal工作的灵魂经纪人不需要担心一次为整个灵魂签订凡人的交易；他们每人每年收集几十个灵魂，来自数百个不同的签约者。签署这种合同的人不需要担心被诅咒到下层世界，成为他们交易的一部分；相反，他们可以（可能）期望他们的后世只是被玷污，因为只有他们永恒的灵魂的一部分上升。他们甚至可以回来签署额外的合同。最重要的是，这个过程不需要任何令人厌烦的血腥仪式或邪恶的诱惑，因为Cabal在普通的办公大楼里运作。",
	"The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a high- ranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.": "Cabal是由贝尔先生创立的，他秘密地是一个名叫贝尔法戈的高级魔鬼。在他来到物质世界的时候，灵魂交易是一件笨拙的事情，需要一个生物用它的整个灵魂来换取一个好处，而这个好处很少像灵魂本身一样有价值。虽然这个系统意味着魔鬼几乎总是从他们的交易中获利，但也意味着愿意与他们交换的生物少得多。为了解决这个问题，Belphagor得出了一个凡人灵魂的确切货币价值，以及一个只交易其中一小部分的系统。不久之后，人类的贪婪和自由市场就带着这个想法跑了。贝尔法戈不再需要派小精灵与凡人讨价还价，他们会来找他。在贝尔先生的伪装下，他购买了一间办公室，雇佣了一批铁皮人员工，并以卡巴尔的名义开张营业。",
	"The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams.": "阴谋集团会雇佣任何通过前提法律和经纪考试的人，但更喜欢盗贼雇员，因为他们有天生的银色舌头和地狱之血。灵魂经纪人也可以被雇用来监督其他法律事务，因为大多数灵魂经纪人在参加经纪人考试之前就已经成为合格的律师。",
	"Based on the militarized world of Fraxus-12 on the outer rim, the Coalition is the largest private military corporation in the 'verse. Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition's specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).": "联盟的总部设在外环线上的军事化世界Fraxus-12，是世界上最大的私人军事公司。五百年前由一群叛逃的军事领导人建立，据称联盟拥有一支近十亿的常备军，并拥有与之匹配的舰队。虽然这些数字与精灵、矮人或人类的军事力量相比相形见绌，但联盟的士兵训练有素、装备精良，使他们比任何战斗人员都要强。虽然联盟士兵可以被雇佣为保镖或雇佣兵，但联盟的专长是扭转银河系冲突的趋势（以合适的价格）。",
	"The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier's basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal's word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.": "联盟由一个由将军、海军将领和空中元帅组成的理事会领导，称为战争室。这个由军事专家组成的委员会讨论战术，建立新的军事学说，甚至审议联盟士兵基本制服的变化。战争室由现任高级元帅提伯瑞斯-温特（Tiberious Vinter）主持，他是一个威严的半兽人，拥有近一个世纪的战斗经验和令人印象深刻的胡须。在作战室里，大元帅的话就是法律，他的决定就是最终决定；值得称道的是，文特元帅很少轻率地或未经深思熟虑地做出决定。他和他的委员会都很清楚，他们的行动承载着数百万人的生命，他们都不会掉以轻心。",
	"Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax's Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.": "虽然联盟会加入任何能够负担得起他们服务的战争，但所有的士兵都要遵守严格的战争准则。该守则禁止奴役、种族灭绝、行星破坏（不包括4级和5级世界）和公开的海盗行为。任何被发现从事此类活动的士兵或军官将被立即谴责并接受军事法庭的审判。因此，尽管联盟与其他雇佣兵组织，如格拉克斯的人和规模与方，在同一战区运作，但他们受到一定程度的尊重，使他们从竞争中脱颖而出。",
	"Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition's greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle.": "在其令人难以置信的舰队旁边，联盟最大的资产可能是它的暖气师分会。在人类的裂谷战争中，旧的暖男学院被分成两派，一派是为联盟对抗精灵森林舰队，一派是与拉克西对抗兽人战神。当尘埃落定时，拉克西脱离了联盟，暖男学院承诺为拉克西的新政府献身。暖男的忠诚者感到震惊，许多人叛逃加入了联盟，他们认为联盟是人类联盟之间的一个中立阵营。今天，联盟将暖男作为一支尖端的奥术部队，将战斗性的魔法与新技术相融合，使联盟部队在战场上拥有无与伦比的战术优势。",
	"Based out of four exceedingly high-class offices on the four maws surrounding the galactic core, Drog, Dusset, & Durgen Acquisitions & Trade is the premier high-tier trade organization and antiquities dealer in the galaxy. While other trading guilds deal in ordinary commodities and goods, DD&D concerns itself with only the most exotic and lucrative items, and charges exorbitantly high fees for the trouble. Vast shipments of gold, gems, precious metals such as mithral and adamantine, rare magic items, and artifacts are DD&D's domain.": "Drog, Dusset, & Durgen Acquisitions & Trade是银河系中最重要的高级贸易组织和古董商，其总部设在银河系核心周围的四条巨龙上的四个极其高级的办公室里。当其他贸易行会处理普通商品和货物时，DD&D只关注最奇特和最有利可图的物品，并为其收取高昂的费用。大量的黄金、宝石、贵金属（如密特拉和金刚砂）、稀有的魔法物品和文物是DD&D的领域。",
	"DD&D takes a special interest in traditional magic items, like necklaces of fireballs, wands of wonder, and gauntlets of ogre power, as opposed to items built on modern magical technology, such as motion trackers and transmat decks. These antique items possess an elegance and craftsmanship (not to mention an invaluable rarity) unparalleled in modern items.": "DD&D对传统的魔法物品特别感兴趣，如火球项链、奇迹魔杖和食人魔之铠，而不是基于现代魔法技术的物品，如运动追踪器和透视牌。这些古董物品拥有现代物品无法比拟的优雅和工艺（更不用说宝贵的稀有性）。",
	"Being collectors of antiquities and traders of magic items, DD&D is always in the market for intrepid explorers, brave adventurers, and others who can survive ancient deathtraps in order to plunder its treasures. Of these adventures, the most successful (and longest lived) are offered positions as Artifactors, operating as the organization's premier tradesmen and dungeon delvers. Artifactors plan and oversee DD&D's high profile expeditions, and are afforded exceptional manpower and resources to do so.": "作为古董的收藏家和魔法物品的商人，DD&D总是在市场上寻找无畏的探险家、勇敢的冒险家，以及其他能够在古代死亡陷阱中幸存下来以掠夺其宝藏的人。在这些冒险者中，最成功的（也是最长寿的）被提供了神器的职位，作为该组织最重要的商人和地牢探险者来运作。神器师们计划并监督DD&D的高调探险，并获得了特殊的人力和资源来完成这项工作。",
	"The oft-quoted tale of DD&D's origins involves the titular founders, now all (presumably) long dead, aiding an eternal dragon named Garfreckt in moving its hoard from one edge of space to another. According to the story, the founders discovered a new hoard-planet for the dragon, the remnant core of a dead gas giant, now a planet-sized ball of pure diamond, and helped the dragon move into this new home. In exchange, the dragon parted with a few of its baubles (all legendary magic items), which the founders traded to establish their company. Of course, such a tale is more or less impossible to verify, but most acquisitions agents agree that, if anyone could have done it, their founders could have.": "经常被引用的DD&D起源的故事涉及到名义上的创始人，现在都（估计）早就死了，帮助一条名叫Garfreckt的永恒之龙把它的囤积物从空间的一个边缘转移到另一个。根据这个故事，创始人为龙发现了一个新的囤积星球，即一个死去的气体巨人的残余核心，现在是一个星球大小的纯钻石球，并帮助龙搬到这个新家。作为交换，龙分出了它的一些小玩意（都是传说中的魔法物品），创始人用这些小玩意换来了他们公司的成立。当然，这样的故事或多或少是无法证实的，但大多数收购代理商都认为，如果有人能做到这一点，他们的创始人可以做到。",
	"At first blush, it can be hard to tell that any part of the Firm's dealings is illicit; after all, its contracts are watertight, its checks never bounce, and its lawyers are impeccable. Those in the know, however, understand that, for all its business accoutrement, the Firm is the largest organized crime syndicate in the 'verse.": "乍一看，很难说该公司的任何交易都是非法的；毕竟，它的合同是无懈可击的，它的支票从不跳票，它的律师也是无可挑剔的。然而，了解情况的人知道，就其所有的商业装备而言，该公司是'se'中最大的有组织犯罪集团。",
	"To conduct its various illegal operations, which include hacking, weapons trafficking, and elaborate heists, the Firm hires short-term Contractors, individuals specially- recruited to match the details of a particular job. Contractors are abundant and varied, including everyone from expert hackers to common thugs, but all are expected to follow their contracts to the letter, regardless of what deeds they entail. Many Contractors even play the part of businessmen with aplomb. By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm's Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.": "为了开展各种非法行动，包括黑客攻击、武器贩运和精心策划的抢劫，公司雇用了短期承包商，这些人是根据特定工作的细节而专门招募的。承包商数量众多，种类繁多，包括从黑客专家到普通暴徒，但所有人都被要求严格遵守合同，无论他们需要做什么工作。许多承包人甚至还潇洒地扮演着商人的角色。就其性质而言，承包商是分门别类的，最终是可以被消耗的；没有一个承包商知道可能会使公司管理层入罪的细节，如果他们成为一个问题，他们的合同可以被终止，通常是通过无保护的太空行走。",
	"Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm's dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm's Middle- Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the 'verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they're also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling's light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.": "由于该公司交易的阴暗性质，关于其管理层的具体细节很难得到。然而，有很多传言说，可以在整个大陆的炉灶上找到该公司的中层管理人员。当然，这意味着，虽然半身人可以提供舒适的床和温暖的食物，但他们也会在一旁非法敛财。半身人的脚步轻盈，毕竟是偷窃的好帮手，如果他们觉得有这种倾向的话。与中间人的大多数公司通信也是利用地精的技术，为秘密会议打开安静的、无法进入的死亡魔法区，同时也阻止了大多数魔法形式的追踪。因此，我们很难确定谁雇用了承包商，谁设计了他们的工作。",
	"A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm's activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone's guess, but seeing as the Firm's reach stretches across the 'verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it's unwise to underestimate their resources.": "一个奇怪的传言说，指导公司活动的小型董事会在一艘名为 \"高层管理 \"的私人战舰上开会。这个传言是否属实谁也不知道，但是看到该公司的触角延伸到了整个'诗篇'，几乎延伸到了电网上的每一个口粮站和世界，低估他们的资源是不明智的。",
	"Not to be confused with Grax's Cheap Guys (a wholly different company), Grax's Guys for Cheap is one of the most prolific mercenary services in the 'verse. Operating at least one bar/inn/business office on every maw on the grid (including those on the outer rim), GGFC is often seen as one of the more stable sources of income a decent, hardworking adventurer can come across, so long as they don't mind the fifteen percent finder's fee (and the smell).": "不要与 \"格雷克斯的廉价伙计\"（完全不同的公司）混淆，\"格雷克斯的廉价伙计 \"是'诗篇'中最多产的雇佣兵服务之一。GGFC在网格上的每一个巨口（包括外缘的巨口）都至少有一个酒吧/酒馆/商务办公室，它通常被视为一个正直、勤奋的冒险者可以遇到的更稳定的收入来源之一，只要他们不介意15%的找人费（和气味）。",
	"Established over fifty years ago, Grax's Guys for Cheap is the lifetime project of Grax Grraxe, an orcish warlord who left the Warzone to escape the constant bloodshed, explosions, and general unpleasantness. Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn't involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the 'verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax's Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.": "Grax's Guys for Cheap成立于50多年前，是Grax Grraxe的毕生事业，他是一个兽人军阀，为了逃避不断发生的流血、爆炸和一般的不愉快而离开战区。他发现在他访问过的任何星球上都无法获得体面的工作（至少是不涉及打人膝盖的工作），格拉克斯搬到了外环，卖掉了他的船，并着手建立一个公司，接受任何人作为赞助人或雇员。今天，在'诗篇'中没有其他雇佣兵服务是如此广泛的。虽然其他人可能有更好的设备，有更好的训练，或乘坐更好的船只，但没有人能够在数量和韧性方面与格拉克斯的人相提并论；此外，格拉克斯提供最好的啤酒。",
	"GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax's Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax's success. Grax's Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a half- up-front deposit. Their tagline \"You can trust Grax!\" can be seen advertised in almost every port in the 'verse.": "GGFC的运作方式与其他大多数雇佣兵公司有些不同。虽然他们并不排斥大多数雇佣兵所期望的保镖任务、保安人员或军事支援，但未来的雇主几乎可以要求Grax的人做任何事情：一个雇佣兵可能会接受一份在银河系中运送罗斯瓦利亚星猪的工作，然后在那些猪的餐厅中充当一个短工厨师。这种广泛的工作岗位一直是格雷克斯成功的基石。格拉克斯的伙计们几乎可以接受任何工作，只要它在大多数银河系地区是合法的，而且报酬可以接受，并预付一半的定金。他们的口号是：\"你可以信任格雷克斯！\"几乎在所有的港口都可以看到广告。",
	"Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy's outcasts. Not to mention the fact that half-orcs are tough and easy to hire.": "自成立以来，格拉克斯一直致力于为被剥夺权利和不被信任的种族的佣兵提供定期合同，特别是混血儿。他在离开战区后试图寻找有报酬的工作的经历使他认识到，银河系的弃儿需要可靠和合法的就业。更不用说半兽人很强悍，很容易被雇用。",
	"For over a hundred years, colonists and homesteaders on the edge of the Galactic Frontier have told legends and tales about the \"White Angel of the Outer Rim.\" When bandits began to overrun their homes, the angel appeared in the sky, ready to mete out justice. When natural disaster threatened their worlds, the angel arrived and ferried them to safety. And when slaughter, death, or capture came from off-world, the angel came to burn their foes with holy fire.": "一百多年来，银河系边疆的殖民者和自耕农一直在讲述关于 \"外环线白衣天使 \"的传说和故事。当强盗开始侵占他们的家园时，天使出现在天空中，准备伸张正义。当自然灾害威胁到他们的世界时，天使到达并把他们送到安全地带。而当屠杀、死亡或捕获来自异世界时，天使就会来用圣火烧毁他们的敌人。",
	"While not a literal guardian angel, the S.S. Saint Vincent might be the closest thing that most folks of the Frontier have to one. The Saint Vincent is a single stark- white human battleship, a Warbringer-class vessel, owned and operated by volunteer peacekeepers and lawmen, seeking to bring order and justice to lawless space. Led by the unflappable Capt. Banoris Starfall, the crew of the Saint Vincent are often the only thing standing in the way of utter chaos on the Frontier.": "虽然不是字面上的守护天使，但圣文森特号可能是边境地区大多数人最接近的东西。圣文森特号是一艘单桅白色的人类战舰，是 \"战神 \"级的船只，由志愿维和人员和执法者拥有和运营，旨在为无法无天的空间带来秩序和正义。在不屈不挠的巴诺里斯-星坠上尉的带领下，圣文森特号的船员往往是唯一能阻止边境地区彻底混乱的人。",
	"The greatest foe that threatens the Saint Vincent is the wrothian menace, which preys upon Frontier worlds with impunity. A constant game of cat and mouse, the Saint Vincent tries to be everywhere at once, patrolling thousands of endangered worlds while probing the Black for the slumbering wrothian ships. Only in rare moments of dramatic confrontation does the Saint Vincent corner and exchange blows with its nemeses, but it is only a matter of time until one side or the other is destroyed.": "威胁圣文森特号的最大敌人是巫师的威胁，它肆无忌惮地掠夺边疆世界。圣文森特号不断地玩着猫捉老鼠的游戏，它试图同时出现在所有地方，在数以千计的濒危世界上巡逻，同时探测黑夜中沉睡的巫师船。只有在罕见的戏剧性对峙时刻，圣文森特才会将其敌人逼到墙角并与之交手，但这只是时间问题，直到一方被摧毁。",
	"The Saint Vincent is named for a cleric of legend who is said to have written the first laws of High Terra, which were passed to him from the gods. These laws listed every conceivable crime, but had no punishments: Saint Vincent's cudgel would be the sole arbiter of all sin. Today, the White Angel of the Outer Rim carries this maverick sense of justice to the far stars, protecting worlds the other factions have never seen and combating threats they have never heard of.": "圣文森特号是以一位传说中的教士命名的，据说他写下了高等泰拉的第一部法律，这些法律是由诸神传给他的。这些法律列出了所有可以想象的罪行，但没有惩罚措施。圣文森特的拐杖将是所有罪行的唯一仲裁者。今天，外环地区的白衣天使将这种特立独行的正义感带到了遥远的星空，保护其他派别从未见过的世界，打击他们闻所未闻的威胁。",
	"Notoriously tough, formidable, and armed to the teeth, Scale and Fang bodyguards cut a menacing figure. In the mercenary world, Scale and Fang Inc. is known for hiring the most powerfully-built bodyguards available (notably many dragonborn) who will dive in front of a blaster bolt at a moment's notice for their charge. These bodyguards are the finest in the 'verse, specializing in escorting high- class clientele through dangerous areas. In fact, it's rare to see a Hegemony governor or an elven aristocrat walking the maws without a posse of Scale and Fang dragonborn. Though clients should expect to pay handsomely for the protection service, they can rest easy knowing that Scale and Fang are watching over them.": "鳞片和獠牙公司的保镖出了名的强悍、可怕，而且武装到了牙齿，他们的形象气势如虹。在雇佣兵世界里，\"天秤座 \"公司以雇佣最强壮的保镖而闻名（尤其是许多龙裔），他们会在接到通知的一刹那为他们的负责人跳到爆破弹面前。这些保镖是这个世界上最好的，专门护送高级客户通过危险区域。事实上，很少看到霸权主义的总督或精灵族的贵族在没有鳞片和獠牙龙裔的陪伴下在大口中行走。虽然客户应该期望为保护服务支付高昂的费用，但他们可以放心，因为他们知道天平和方在看着他们。",
	"Headquartered in a planetoid made of pure diamond near Draxel, Scale and Fang is funded largely by the eternal dragon, Garfreckt. Purportedly, Garfreckt founded the company when he lost a bet with an elven adventurer and promised away his small army of dragonborn minions to help complete the elf's quest. When the dragonborn returned, they were accompanied by a half-dozen others, each wishing to inquire how to enlist the dragonborn for their own services. Because of the dragonborn's expertise in protecting their master and his hoard, their skills were tailor-made to keeping watch over others, and thus Scale and Fang was born.": "鳞片和獠牙公司的总部设在德拉塞尔附近的一个由纯钻石制成的行星上，其资金主要来自永恒之龙加弗雷克特。据称，加弗莱克特在与一位精灵冒险家打赌输掉后成立了这家公司，并承诺送走他的小型龙裔爪牙军队以帮助完成精灵的任务。当龙裔回来时，他们身边还有半打人，每个人都希望询问如何争取龙裔为自己服务。由于龙裔在保护他们的主人和他的囤积物方面的专长，他们的技能是为监视他人而量身定做的，因此，\"鳞甲与方 \"诞生了。",
	"While most religions are strictly tied to the planets from which their gods originate, there is at least one church gaining a foothold throughout the 'verse. The Temple of the Chosen venerates a diverse pantheon of spacefarers, who each, it is said, ascended from their mortal forms and attained godhood, granting them dominion over the entire galaxy. This pantheon, known as the Chosen, contains no names, only titles corresponding to their god's position aboard their celestial spacecraft, the Ark:": "虽然大多数宗教都与他们的神的来源星球严格挂钩，但至少有一个教会在整个 \"诗篇 \"中获得了立足之地。天选者神庙崇敬一个由太空人组成的不同万神殿，据说他们每个人都从凡人的形式中升华并获得神性，赋予他们对整个星系的统治权。这个被称为 \"神选者 \"的万神殿没有名字，只有与他们的神在天体飞船 \"方舟 \"上的位置相对应的称号。",

	"It is difficult, however, to parse religion in absolutes. Some people believe the Chosen and their Ark are merely a metaphor, a guideline by which to live a more perfect life. Others, however, believe the Chosen to be real, immortal beings traveling the universe in an omnipotent ship. Historians, meanwhile, suggest that the story of the Chosen and the Ark might be loosely derived from some ancient tale of a real ship that underwent a fateful journey past the edge of the galaxy and never returned.": "然而，很难用绝对的方式来解析宗教。有些人认为神选者和他们的方舟只是一种隐喻，是一种准则，据此可以过一种更完美的生活。然而，其他人则认为神选者是真实的、不朽的生命，他们乘坐一艘无所不能的船在宇宙中旅行。同时，历史学家认为，神选者和方舟的故事可能松散地来自于一些古老的故事，即一艘真正的飞船经历了一次宿命的旅行，经过银河系的边缘后再也没有回来。",
	"Whatever the truth is, the Temple adheres strictly to the belief that the Chosen are divinity, whose celestial ship grants them dominion over all worlds in the 'verse.

It traces its origins back to Terminus the First, the same mage (now lich) who established the Hegemony of Man and expanded its boundaries. Terminus ostensibly founded the Tower as a fraternal order to unite arcanists from across the stars, but its clandestine nature makes its true intentions hard to discern. The Tower's inner-sanctums are closed to those who do not undergo their esoteric induction rituals, its agents speak in coded language, and the highest echelons of its memberships share profound secrets unknown to all others, including lower-ranking Tower agents.": "塔的确是一个奥术师的秘密社团，充斥着神秘的密码和深奥的仪式。它的起源可以追溯到第一代Terminus，也就是建立人类霸权并扩大其边界的法师（现在的巫师）。表面上看，特米努斯建立的塔是一个兄弟会，以团结来自整个星际的奥术师，但它的秘密性质使得它的真实意图难以辨别。塔的内部圣殿对那些没有经过其神秘的入会仪式的人是封闭的，它的代理人用编码语言说话，其成员的最高层分享着不为人知的深层秘密，包括低级别的塔代理人。",

	"Perhaps the Tower is truly a conspiratorial network of powerful arcanists with a grand agenda, or perhaps, for all its trappings, it's more like an arcane boy's club, trading secrets and restricting membership to the select few. It's even possible that the Tower sees itself as acting in the galaxy's interest by securing powerful artifacts and spells before they can fall into the wrong hands. What is certainly true is that the Tower's agents are as numerous as they are undetectable, that its libraries contain forbidden arcane knowledge, and that only a few know its true intentions.": "也许通天塔真的是一个由强大的奥术师组成的阴谋网络，有着宏伟的计划，或者说，就其所有的外衣而言，它更像是一个奥术男孩的俱乐部，交易秘密并限制少数人加入。甚至有可能塔认为自己是为了银河系的利益而行动，在强大的神器和法术落入坏人之手之前确保它们。可以肯定的是，通天塔的特工人数众多，而且不容易被发现，它的图书馆里有禁忌的奥术知识，而且只有少数人知道它的真实意图。",

I have spent my life studying the holy texts, meditating on their hidden meanings. In doing so, however, I have learned some things that the cult of the Sun Above would rather stayed hidden. Their doctrine is founded on lies, and that, I cannot abide. Thus, I have dedicated the rest of my days to spreading the truth across the galaxy.\"": "\"那是一个很长的故事，\"他说，\"但我已经知道你的一切，所以我至少要给你一个简短的版本，这才公平。那就是这样。我是一个普通的和尚。我一生都在研究圣典，冥思苦想它们隐藏的含义。然而，在这样做的过程中，我学到了一些太阳神的崇拜者宁愿隐藏起来的东西。他们的教义是建立在谎言之上的，而这是我不能容忍的。因此，我把余下的日子献给了在整个银河系传播真理。\"",
	"The implication was obvious. \"So, you're a nonbeliever. A heretic.\"": "其含义是显而易见的。\"所以，你是一个不信教的人。一个异教徒。\"",
	"\"In the eyes of the High Priests, yes. They are hunting me and my brethren, which is why I need that legendary weapon. Naturally, any other treasures in the dragon's hoard would be yours to keep.

	"The hundred million stars in our galaxy play host to a menagerie of intelligent life, wondrous creatures both great and small. Arguably, the most prominent of these creatures are those that discovered Dark Matter technology early and used it to garner some territory of their own on the galactic stage, naming planets and forging great fleets to defend their space. There are thousands of intelligent races yet to be discovered, a variety that includes every campaign setting ever made.": "我们银河系中的一亿颗恒星孕育了大量的智慧生命，这些奇妙的生物有大有小。可以说，这些生物中最突出的是那些很早就发现了暗物质技术，并利用它在银河系的舞台上获得了一些自己的领地，为行星命名并组建了强大的舰队来保卫自己的空间。有数以千计的智能种族尚未被发现，其种类包括有史以来的每一个活动设置。",

But, indeed, there are some races that are completely original to the Dark Matter setting; races that have shaped the history of the galaxy, and make excellent additions to parties of explorers, adventurers, and traders. This chapter contains six new races, and a new subrace for humans.": "黑暗物质的设定可以包含任何你在典型的角色扮演游戏中会发现的种族：精灵、兽人和矮人，当然还有其他许多种族。甚至来自地球的人类也可以在黑暗物质中找到，如果可以提供一些手段将他们从太阳周围的死亡魔法区拉出来的话。但是，确实有一些种族是黑暗物质设定中完全原创的；这些种族塑造了银河系的历史，并成为探险家、冒险家和商人队伍中的优秀补充。本章包含六个新种族，以及一个新的人类亚种族。",

These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly well- educated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.": "在系统和逻辑的诱惑下，一个疯狂的古怪群体拥抱了科学。这些不同的工匠、学生和发明家往往在科学、奥秘和工程原理方面受到一致的良好教育（或至少是高度自学），特别注重实际应用。尽管大多数小工匠至少对宇宙的潜在奥秘感到好奇，但许多人认为突破性的科学发现是达到目的的手段；理论的存在只是为了促进应用。",
	"Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace.

All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.": "在突破和科学进步的推动下，小发明家们推动着科学和创新的前沿，以惊人的速度设计出新的技术奇迹（或至少是新的爆破器变种）。一些小发明家专注于某个特定的问题，单独为其创新和优化解决方案，而其他人则在任何可以找到应用的地方设计技术奇迹。现代世界的所有伟大进步，从数据板到暗物质引擎，都是由小发明家带头实现的。",
	"A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.": "一个小发明家很少被看到远离漂浮的全息球体，那是他们的人工智能（AI）伴侣。毕竟，一个有机体的大脑只能容纳这么多的信息，而人工智能可以轻松地回忆方程式，追踪原理图，并进行计算。当然，如果没有小发明家的聪明才智，这样的智力是微不足道的，但人工智能的眼睛仍然可以发现他们的创造者可能没有注意到的错误。",
	"But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.": "但不仅如此，人工智能伴侣也是一个不知疲倦的朋友。一个小发明家无休止的工作往往可能是单调和孤立的，但人工智能在一个人耳边不断发出的友好声音，对防止疯狂科学家和末日设备有很大帮助。",
	"When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?": "在设计你的小发明家时，考虑是什么吸引了你的角色去研究科学。是解决一个新难题的挑战，还是完善一个新发明的刺激？也许你的角色痴迷于宇宙的某个特定方面，并渴望揭开其神秘面纱。想想你是如何了解科学和工程的。你是否有一个塑造你的理解的导师，或者你完全是自学成才？",
	"Also, consider which Prototype you'll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit?

	"More so than almost any other class, the gadgeteer is uniquely focused on science and engineering, which might not fit cohesively with all campaign settings. If used in a setting outside of Dark Matter, it might be useful to translate the class into more familiar terms: rather than 'Gadgets,' the gadgeteer uses 'Magic Items,' rather than an 'AI Companion,' they have a 'Sentient Magic Item,' and rather than a 'Prototype,' they have a 'Relic', and so on. The mechanics of most of these devices need not be changed, for technology in Dark Matter is also generally powered by magic.": "比起其他几乎所有的等级，\"小发明家 \"独特地专注于科学和工程，这可能并不适合所有的竞选环境。如果在黑暗物质之外的环境中使用，把这个等级翻译成更熟悉的术语可能是有用的：与其说是 \"小玩意\"，不如说是 \"魔法物品\"，与其说是 \"人工智能伴侣\"，不如说是 \"有生命的魔法物品\"，与其说是 \"原型\"，不如说是 \"遗物\"，等等。大多数这些设备的机制不需要改变，因为黑暗物质中的技术一般也是由魔法驱动的。",
	"Blasters, on the other hand, are fairly unique to Dark Matter. The bonus damage offered by Overcharge can be applied to ranged attacks from crossbows or cantrips, as appropriate to the setting.": "另一方面，爆破手在黑暗物质中是相当独特的。过度充电提供的额外伤害可以应用于十字弓或咒语的远程攻击，这与设定相适应。",

	"For some characters and campaigns, a fun alternative might be to present the gadgeteer as a time-traveler or a stranded visitor from outer space, equipped with high technology. This angle works best with a heavy dose of humor and satire, contrasting a conventional fantasy setting with a sci-fi outsider.": "对于某些角色和活动来说，一个有趣的替代方案可能是将小发明家表现为一个时间旅行者或来自外太空的滞留者，配备了高科技。这个角度的作品最好带有浓厚的幽默和讽刺意味，将传统的幻想背景与科幻的外来者形成对比。",
	"Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level.

	"Oh no, it will be very difficult,\" replied the vect. \"There are rumors going around about warheads being smuggled through the Miaam-Osk Pathway, but they're sure to be heavily guarded.\"": "哦，不，这将是非常困难的，\"vect回答说。\"有传言说弹头通过米亚姆-奥斯克通道被偷运，但它们肯定会被严密看管。\"",
	"Rami did some quick calculations. \"I like the plan, but that's five maw jumps away. Ain't gonna be many people going that way on legitimate business either. I reckon we're gonna need to grab a ship of our own while we're here... You know how to hotwire a Dark Matter drive, right, Nano?\"": "拉米做了一些快速计算。\"我喜欢这个计划，但那是五次跳跃的距离。也不会有很多人为了合法的生意去那里。我估计我们在这里的时候需要抓住一艘我们自己的船......。你知道如何启动暗物质驱动装置，对吗，纳诺？\"",
	"After a brief period of rummaging, the gadgeteer produced a small object, bristling with probes, cables, and various other protrusions. \"Certainly. If this thing still works.\" Nano pressed a switch, reconnected a few loose plugs, thought for a moment, then ripped out a fat cylindrical component. Lights started blinking all over the device. \"There we go.\"": "在短暂的翻找之后，这个小发明家拿出一个小东西，上面布满了探头、电缆和其他各种突起物。\"当然可以。如果这东西还能用的话。\" 纳诺按了一个开关，重新连接了几个松动的插头，想了一会儿，然后扯出了一个肥大的圆柱形部件。灯光开始在设备上四处闪烁。\"我们走吧。\"",

	"The door led to a lift, which was precisely as fast as the vect said. However, Nano failed to mention the gut-wrenching g-forces as the lift rocketed to the docks above. Rami and Mekhet- Nu stumbled out slowly, trying to maintain composure and avoid throwing up. Nano, oblivious, stalked forward into a cavernous hangar, in which dozens of ships were parked, no two the same.": "这扇门通向一部电梯，电梯的速度恰好和vect说的一样快。然而，纳诺没有提到电梯飞到上面的码头时令人心惊肉跳的重力作用。拉米和梅克特-努慢慢地走了出来，试图保持镇定，避免呕吐。纳诺无动于衷，径直走向一个空旷的机库，里面停放着几十艘飞船，没有两艘是相同的。",

	"Thus they proceeded, with Nano offering apologies to anyone whose paths they crossed, assuring them that the lights would be fixed as soon as possible.": "因此，他们继续前进，纳诺向任何与他们擦肩而过的人表示歉意，并向他们保证会尽快修好这些灯。",
	"In the first bay was a sleek elven Interceptor, its pulse cannon half-disassembled, while an aristocratic elf—presumably the ship's owner—remonstrated with a pair of technicians.

	"The many worlds of Dark Matter are filled with characters great and small, from the gnomish mechanics that keep the Flotilla aloft, to righteous avia-ra pilgrims proselytizing on backwater worlds, to the intrepid human explorers mapping the far reaches of the galaxy. It is from the perspectives of these outstanding characters that players will discover Dark Matter, tease out its secrets, brave its dangers, and become its staunch protectors, or perhaps, its sinister villains. This chapter contains new options for characters in Dark Matter and other science fiction settings, beginning with a brief introduction on creating new characters in this setting. After that is a section containing new subclasses, both for traditional classes, as well as those written by Mage Hand Press. Next, the chapter contains a list of unique backgrounds, which can help characters of any class root their skills and histories in the Dark Matter universe. Following backgrounds is a list of feats, which are optional character options that represent a character's expertise or exceptionality. Finally, the end of this chapter discusses skills, highlighting new uses for conventional skills and introducing new skills, which expand a character's options in a high-tech science fiction world.": "在《黑暗物质》的众多世界中，充满了大大小小的角色，从维持船队航行的地精机械师，到在偏远世界传教的正义的阿维亚拉朝圣者，再到绘制银河系远方地图的无畏的人类探险家。正是从这些杰出人物的角度，玩家将发现黑暗物质，揭开它的秘密，勇敢面对它的危险，并成为它坚定的保护者，或者也许是它邪恶的反派。本章包含了《黑暗物质》和其他科幻设定中的角色的新选项，首先是关于在此设定中创建新角色的简要介绍。之后是一个包含新的子类的章节，既有传统的类，也有法师之手出版社编写的类。接下来，本章包含一个独特的背景列表，它可以帮助任何等级的角色在黑暗物质宇宙中扎根他们的技能和历史。在背景之后是一个功勋列表，它是代表人物专长或特殊性的可选角色选项。最后，本章末尾讨论了技能，强调了传统技能的新用途，并介绍了新技能，这些技能扩大了角色在高科技科幻世界中的选择。",
	"As a rule, if it belongs in an RPG world, it belongs in Dark Matter.": "作为一项规则，如果它属于RPG世界，它就属于《黑暗物质》。",
	"Every class, every race, and every character option lives in Dark Matter; not just in faraway corners of the universe, but in the forefront. Armor-clad knights, gun- toting cyborgs, and lone outlaws line Dark Matter's cast, a menagerie of characters from all across space and time. Not only does this mean that all the character options from the SRD are at your disposal when making a character, but so is but basically anything else you can think of.": "在《黑暗物质》中，每一个阶级、每一个种族和每一个角色选项都存在；不仅仅是在宇宙的遥远角落，而是在最前线。穿着盔甲的骑士、拿着枪的机械人和孤独的亡命之徒在《黑暗物质》的演员阵容中占了一席之地，这些角色来自各个空间和时间。这不仅意味着在制作角色时，SRD中所有的角色选项都在你的掌握之中，而且基本上你能想到的其他东西也都在其中。",
	"Even though this setting introduces new races and takes time to reinterpret classic fantasy races—elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc.—every other race is also on the table, from tieflings and dragonborn to literal angels and demons. The same goes for class options: this chapter contains a plethora of science fiction variants, which are collectively intended to stand alongside the fantasy perspective of the core rules. Pick a character that speaks to you and build it how you want.": "尽管这个设定引入了新的种族，并花时间重新诠释了经典的幻想种族--精灵、矮人、地精等等--其他所有的种族也都在桌面上，从铁皮人和龙裔到字面上的天使和恶魔。阶级选择也是如此：本章包含了大量的科幻小说变体，它们共同的目的是与核心规则的幻想视角并驾齐驱。挑选一个能让你心动的角色，并按照你的意愿来构建它。",
	"Once you've selected your race and class (and optionally, background, subclass, and feats), it's time to dive into the equipment and skills offered by Dark Matter. The following tables outline your new proficiencies, as well as starting equipment and how best to approach a beginner starship.": "一旦你选择了你的种族和阶级（以及可选的背景、子阶级和特技），就该深入研究《暗物质》提供的装备和技能了。下面的表格概述了你的新技能，以及起始装备和如何最好地接近初级星舰。",
	"Characters of every stripe, from medieval knights, to pirate captains, to Old West gunslingers have a place in Dark Matter. Feel free to use the options presented in this chapter, but don't feel that you should be limited by them. Characters can use any content from Fifth Edition in this setting.": "各种类型的角色，从中世纪的骑士，到海盗船长，再到旧西部的枪手，在《黑暗物质》中都有一席之地。你可以自由地使用本章所介绍的选项，但不要觉得你应该被它们所限制。角色可以在这个设定中使用第五版的任何内容。",

	"The starting equipment from your class generally includes relevant weapons and armor, as well as an assortment of useful adventuring gear, collected in a pack. However, the equipment and packs that come with most classes might seem ill-suited to the demands of traveling through space or exploring an alien planet. Therefore, when you create your character, you can modify your starting equipment by following these guidelines:": "你的等级的起始装备一般包括相关的武器和盔甲，以及各种有用的冒险装备，收集在一个背包里。然而，大多数等级的装备和背包可能看起来不适合在太空中旅行或探索外星的要求。因此，当你创建你的角色时，你可以按照这些准则来修改你的起始装备。",
	"If your class offers a simple or martial melee weapon, you can choose any weapon of the same type (simple or martial) from this book.

	"If your class offers a specific simple ranged weapon and ammunition, such as the light crossbow with bolts or shortbow with arrows, you can instead choose any simple blaster you have proficiency with. If your class offers a specific martial ranged weapon with ammunition, such as a longbow and arrows, you can instead choose any martial blaster you have proficiency with.": "如果你的等级提供了特定的简单远程武器和弹药，例如带箭的轻弩或带箭的短弓，你可以选择任何你熟练掌握的简单爆破器。如果你的等级提供特定的武术远程武器和弹药，比如长弓和箭，你可以选择任何你熟练掌握的武术爆破器。",
	"You can replace any pack you get from your class with one of the following packs, or you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.": "你可以用下面的一个包来代替你从班上得到的任何一个包，或者你可以以所示价格购买一个包，这可能比单独购买物品更便宜。",
	"Because Dark Matter equipment can be more expensive than adventuring equipment in a low-tech campaign setting, with GM permission, you can double the number of gold pieces offered by your class and background.": "因为在低技术含量的战役环境中，暗物质装备可能比冒险装备更昂贵，所以在GM的允许下，你可以将你的等级和背景所提供的金币数量翻倍。",
	"Any character that gains a fighting style can choose from these, in addition to the fighting styles offered by their class:": "任何获得战斗风格的角色都可以从这些风格中选择，除了他们的等级所提供的战斗风格之外。",
	"Nearly every band of explorers, spacers, and mercenaries needs a reliable ship to jetset around the universe. Plenty of smaller-scale games might focus on a single planet, or even a single space station, but for those which explore the breadth of the 'verse, a starting ship is unquestionably key. Sadly, even the most modest ships are unaffordable with the starting gold of any class, so it falls on the GM to decide which ship the party gets access to and how they acquire it.": "几乎所有的探险家、太空人和雇佣兵都需要一艘可靠的飞船在宇宙中飞翔。很多小规模的游戏可能只关注一个星球，甚至是一个空间站，但对于那些探索宇宙广度的游戏来说，一艘初始飞船无疑是关键。可悲的是，即使是最普通的飞船也是任何等级的起始金币都买不起的，所以GM要决定玩家可以获得哪艘飞船，以及他们如何获得它。",
	"As a guideline, parties of 1st to 4th level should get a Personal class ship, parties of 5th to 10th level should get a Transport class ship, and parties of 11th level or higher should get a Corvette class ship. Campaigns with an emphasis on ship combat can eschew these guidelines.": "作为一个准则，1-4级的队伍应该得到一艘个人级飞船，5-10级的队伍应该得到一艘运输级飞船，而11级以上的队伍应该得到一艘护卫级飞船。强调舰艇战斗的战役可以不考虑这些准则。",
	"The GM can choose to bequeath the party a ship on behalf of their employers, either a wealthy benefactor or a faction. Doing this is a surefire way of grounding the party in the world and giving them a launching point for adventures, but also ties them to certain obligations.": "GM可以选择代表他们的雇主，无论是一个富有的恩人还是一个派别，将一艘船遗赠给他们。这样做是使党派立足于这个世界并给他们一个冒险的出发点的可靠方法，但也将他们与某些义务联系在一起。",
	"Another option is for the GM to set a budget, say 10,000 gp, which the party can spend on any ship of Personal or Transport class, as well as their choice of upgrades. This approach is preferable if the party will spend a long time in their ship, whether in space combat or on a long voyage to the Frontier.": "另一个选择是由GM设定一个预算，比如说10,000gp，当事人可以用它来购买任何个人或运输类的飞船，以及他们选择的升级。如果党派将在他们的飞船中花费很长的时间，无论是在太空战斗中还是在前往边境的长途旅行中，这种方法是可取的。",
	"Rarely is a character just a fighter, a rogue, or a cleric; fighters might be gritty space marines, trained in stomping alien space-bugs, rogues might be sophisticated infiltrators, using teleportation and hacking to gain access o encrypted systems, and clerics might be worshipers of the Sun Above, or heretics that worship the all-consuming Void. Whatever the class, a character's subclass imbues it with the detail and expression to make it truly unique.": "一个角色很少只是一个战士、一个流氓或一个牧师；战士可能是狡猾的太空海军陆战队员，接受过踩死外星太空虫子的训练；流氓可能是复杂的潜入者，使用传送和黑客技术进入加密系统；而牧师可能是太阳的崇拜者，或者是崇拜虚空的异教徒。不管是什么类别，一个角色的子类都会赋予其细节和表现力，使其真正的独一无二。",
	"This section contains new subclasses, character-defining choices which are taken at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass helps further narrow the scope of a base class into a specific character archetype by providing features that change the class's playstyle, while grounding it in the world. For example, a Circle of Configuration druid will play very differently than a Circle of the Land druid, nd both paint wildly different pictures of their respective characters.": "本节包含了新的子类，即在1、2、3级时进行的角色定义选择。子类有助于进一步缩小基础类的范围，使其成为一个特定的角色原型，提供改变该类玩法的特征，同时使其在世界中立足。例如，\"配置之环 \"德鲁伊和 \"土地之环 \"德鲁伊的玩法截然不同，两者对各自角色的描绘也大不相同。",
	"In addition to subclasses for classes provided in the SRD, like the Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard, this chapter also has archetypes for Mage Hand Press classes, such as the Alchemist, Craftsman, and Warmage. Characters in Dark Matter campaigns need not pick from among these new subclass options or even play as one of the classes represented here, for characters of every stripe can be encountered in the 'verse; these offerings merely tantalize new, science fiction twists on familiar characters": "除了SRD中提供的类的子类，如战士、游侠和巫师，本章还提供了法师手压类的原型，如炼金术士、工匠和暖气师。黑暗物质战役中的角色不需要从这些新的子类选项中挑选，甚至不需要扮演这里所代表的某个类，因为各种类型的角色都可以在'诗篇'中遇到；这些产品只是对熟悉的角色进行了新的、科幻式的扭曲。",

	"Research into the very nature of the elements has evolved from the erstwhile search for transmutation into gold to an involved magical and scientific field. The four elements can interact in deviously clever ways, especially when unusual states of matter such as plasma are utilized, such that many of the field's core principles could change with only a few major breakthroughs.

Even as the aeons have marched forward and warfare has grown from swords and spears to interplanetary affairs of starships and warheads, barbarians have not budged; they are still an embodiment of primal,furious rage. Some barbarians focus their rage through circuitry and steel, becoming the brutal warlords of a new age, but others shun this new technology, smashing any that comes within arm's reach.": "野蛮人的定义是居住在他们体内的肆无忌惮的愤怒。即使时代在前进，战争从刀枪剑戟发展到星际间的星舰和弹头，野蛮人也没有动摇；他们仍然是原始、愤怒的化身。一些野蛮人通过电路和钢铁来集中他们的愤怒，成为新时代的残酷军阀，但其他野蛮人则回避这种新技术，粉碎任何近在咫尺的东西。",
	"Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.": "愤怒在每个野蛮人的心中燃烧，是驱使他或她走向伟大的熔炉。然而，不同的野蛮人将他们的愤怒归于不同的来源。对一些人来说，它是一个内部的水库，痛苦、悲伤和愤怒在这里被锻造成像钢铁一样坚硬的怒火。其他人则把它看作是一种精神上的祝福，一种图腾动物的礼物。",
	"Bards are consummate performers and entertainers, and often find that their skills have unexpected and widereaching applications across the 'verse. Any bard can play for the guests of a halfling hearthstation, but many bards can also find work as translators, ambassadors, salesmen, spies, and historians. Bards are experts at putting a smiling face on an enterprise and a skilled hand to its operation, which keeps their talents in demand no matter where they travel.": "吟游诗人是完美的表演者和艺人，并且经常发现他们的技能在整个 \"诗篇 \"中有意想不到的广泛用途。任何吟游诗人都可以为半身人炉台的客人演奏，但许多吟游诗人也可以找到翻译、大使、推销员、间谍和历史学家的工作。吟游诗人是为企业增添笑脸的专家，也是企业运营的能手，这使他们的才能无论在哪里都很受欢迎。",
	"The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.": "吟游诗人的方式是好客的。吟游诗人相互寻找，交换歌曲和故事，夸耀他们的成就，并分享他们的知识。吟游诗人组成松散的协会，他们称之为学院，以促进他们的聚会并保护他们的传统。",
	"Masters of sword and spell alike, channelers draw their power from the planes of the multiverse, focusing this energy like a lens to produce magical effects. Channelers have explored the breadth of the 'verse, along with the infinitely more expansive multiverse, in pursuit of their goals, which often include securing nuggets of arcane knowledge or lesser-known artifacts. Their networks of allies, called Planar Orders, extend across the 'verse and might prove invaluable to explorers and adventures lost among the stars, especially to those searching its recesses for similar objectives.": "剑术和法术的大师，引导者从多元宇宙的层面上汲取他们的力量，像透镜一样聚焦这种能量以产生神奇的效果。传导者为了追求他们的目标，已经探索了整个宇宙的广度，以及无限广阔的多元宇宙，其中通常包括确保奥术知识的金块或鲜为人知的神器。他们的盟友网络被称为 \"星球骑士团\"，遍布整个宇宙，可能会被证明对探险家和迷失在星空中的冒险家是非常有价值的，特别是对那些为了类似目标而在星空中搜索的人。",
	"A channeler's first steps into the multiverse are daunting: the infinite planes of existence are treacherous and do not yield their secrets easily. To this end, channelers abroad in the multiverse rely on their planar orders for guidance, protection, and information. Even on their home planes, planar orders sometimes meet to discuss business or ensure that the plane is protected from outsiders with malicious intents.": "传导者进入多元宇宙的第一步是令人生畏的：无限的存在平面是险恶的，不会轻易放弃它们的秘密。为此，在多元宇宙中的通灵者依靠他们的平面指令来获得指导、保护和信息。即使在他们的主位面，平面命令有时也会开会讨论业务，或确保该位面受到保护，不受具有恶意的外来者影响。",
	"This subclass makes use of the Mage Hand Press Channeler class and its accompanying rules. This class can be found for free on magehandpress.com": "这个子类利用了法师手压通道者类和其附带的规则。这个类可以在magehandpress.com上免费找到。",
	"The Order of Mawstone Psions believes that the 'verse is interwoven with innumerable, invisible tethers that tie it all together. Everything and everyone is connected in this grand network, whether or not they are aware of its influence. By attuning themselves to the maws, these channelers achieve an uncanny intuition and a perspective on their place in the 'verse. Their order seeks to keep the 'verse in balance, while following the mysterious will of its tethers.": "毛石幻术团相信，\"经文 \"是由无数无形的绳索交织在一起的。在这个宏大的网络中，每件事和每个人都是相连的，无论他们是否意识到其影响。通过调整自己与大嘴的关系，这些引导者获得了一种不可思议的直觉和对自己在 \"诗篇 \"中的位置的看法。他们的秩序寻求保持 \"诗篇 \"的平衡，同时遵循其系带的神秘意志。",

	"You can use your action to invisibly manipulate objects within 30 feet of you. You can move objects weighing less than 10 pounds, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can't use this ability to attack or activate magic items.": "你可以使用你的行动来隐蔽地操纵你周围30英尺内的物体。你可以移动重量小于10磅的物体，打开未上锁的门或容器，从打开的容器中存放或取回物品，或将小瓶中的物品倒出。你不能使用这种能力来攻击或激活魔法物品。",

	"At 7th level, you gain the following Planar Focus option:": "在第7级时，你获得以下平面聚焦选项。",
	"You can feel the tethers of the universe propelling your movements and guiding your strikes. While you maintain this focus, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. As normal, if you score a critical hit with a spell while Spell Channeling, you roll both the spell's and weapon's damage dice twice.": "你能感觉到宇宙的绳索在推动你的动作，引导你的攻击。当你保持这种专注时，你的近战武器攻击在掷出19或20的时候就能获得关键打击。像往常一样，如果你在施法过程中用法术打出了关键一击，你会把法术和武器的伤害骰子都掷两次。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you can cast the spell {@spell telekinesis} once without using arcana points, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. You can maintain focus on both this spell and a Planar Focus at one time.": "从10级开始，你可以在不使用奥术点的情况下施放一次该法术（%0%），并在完成短期或长期休息后重新获得施放能力。你可以同时对这个法术和一个平面焦点保持专注。",

	"The gods of the 'verse are many and varied. Practically every inhabited world bears its own pantheon of unique deities, each of which are capable of bestowing their believers with true miracles—feats of divine magic. Therefore, faith is an important resource on the galactic stage, as many rival pantheons compete for adherents. Clerics in Dark Matter can worship the gods of any traditional pantheon, or they might pledge their lives to the Temple of the Chosen, the Church of the Sun Above, or even fringe beliefs which venerate the all-consuming Void.": "诗篇》中的神灵很多，而且种类繁多。实际上，每一个有人居住的世界都有自己的万神殿，每一个神都能给他们的信徒带来真正的奇迹--神圣的魔法的效果。因此，信仰是银河系舞台上的一个重要资源，因为许多敌对的神殿都在争夺信徒。暗物质的教士们可以崇拜任何传统的万神殿的神，或者他们可以把自己的生命交给神选者的神殿、太阳神的教会，甚至是崇尚全能的虚空的边缘信仰。",
	"In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity's domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity's portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain. Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (\"radiant\") Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (\"healing\"), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.": "在一个万神殿中，每个神灵都对凡人生活和文明的不同方面有影响，称为神灵的领域。一个神灵对其具有影响力的所有领域被称为神灵的组合。例如，希腊的阿波罗神的组合包括知识、生命和光等领域。作为一个牧师，你选择你的神的组合中的一个方面来强调，你被授予与该领域有关的力量。你的选择可能与致力于你的神灵的特定教派相对应。例如，阿波罗在一个地区被崇拜为Phoebus（\"光芒四射\"）的阿波罗，强调他对光明领域的影响，而在另一个地方被崇拜为Apollo Acesius（\"治疗\"），强调他与生命领域的联系。另外，你对领域的选择可能仅仅是一个个人偏好的问题，是神灵最吸引你的方面。",
	"The builders of fleets and founders of cities, craftsmen throughout the 'verse are highly sought out for their technical expertise and mechanical know-how. Nearly every large ship in the verse counts at least one craftsman among their number, and likely many more. The proliferation of new technology, both the magical, like {@filter blasters|items|property=blaster} and {@item Dark Matter Engines|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines}, and the nonmagical variety, like the great gnomish ships, has led to a swathe of new discoveries and innovations made by notable craftsman. No longer are craftsmen merely blacksmiths and leatherworkers—they are roboticists, inventors, and engineers.": "作为舰队的建造者和城市的缔造者，整个诗篇的工匠们因其技术专长和机械知识而备受青睐。诗篇中几乎每艘大船都至少有一个工匠，甚至可能更多。新技术的扩散，包括魔法的，如{@filter blasters|items|property=blaster}和{@item Dark Matter Engines|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines}，以及非魔法的，如伟大的地精船，导致了著名的工匠们的大量新发现和创新。工匠们不再仅仅是铁匠和皮革工人--他们是机器人专家、发明家和工程师。",
	"All master craftsmen individually learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under tutelage of another master artisan. However, as they hone their skills, they invariably find themselves drawn to gatherings of other like-minded craftsmen. These groups, formalized as Guilds, provide a means for craftsmen to compare notes and schematics, acquire resources, and provide a means for craftsmen to ply their trade.": "所有的工匠大师都各自学习铁匠、皮革加工、木工和其他通往大师之路的必要学科的基础知识，要么自己学习，要么在其他工匠大师的指导下学习。然而，当他们磨练自己的技能时，他们总是发现自己被其他志同道合的工匠们所吸引。这些团体被正式命名为行会，为工匠们提供了一个比较笔记和图纸、获取资源的途径，并为工匠们提供了一个从事其行业的手段。",
	"Most craftsmen do their best work in precisely arranged workshops, with exact components, plenty of tools and space, and all the best materials. You've learned to be far more pragmatic and flexible with your choices for tools, materials, and workspace, allowing you to forge deadly gear out of little more than a box of scraps and a roll of v{@item ent tape|darkmatter}.": "大多数工匠都是在精确安排的车间里完成他们最好的工作，有精确的部件、充足的工具和空间，以及所有最好的材料。你已经学会了在工具、材料和工作空间的选择上更加务实和灵活，使你能够用一箱废料和一卷V{@item ent tape|darkmatter}锻造出致命的装备。",
	"Starting when you choose this guild at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with improvised weapons.": "从你在3级时选择这个公会开始，你获得对简易武器的熟练度。"
