	"A monster with thermalsight can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog. The monster can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, the monster can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. Many constructs have this special sense.": "拥有热视力的怪物可以通过黑暗和严重遮蔽的条件（如雾）看到生物。该怪物还可以通过其体温来判断一个生物是活还是死。然而，怪物不能辨别颜色，也不能用这种感觉看穿幻象、隐形或魔法黑暗。这种感觉会被一英寸的任何固体障碍物所阻挡。许多结构体都有这种特殊的感觉。",
	"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.": "这个在黑暗物质中的新技能决定了一个人能够多好地操纵技术界面并获得信息或其他功能。你的智力（数据）检查包含了你对软件及其利用的知识，而不是硬件（硬件由技术技能涵盖），所以只有在你使用有界面的技术时才会用到，比如数据板、奥术终端、飞船的计算机，或者其他控制技术，比如门控或控制（%0%）或飞船武器的计算机。如果一项技术没有接口，则需要一个接口设备来与之互动。当你试图对一个数据系统进行复杂的操作时，当你试图对一个构造物进行重新编程时，或者当你试图入侵一个设备时，GM应该要求进行智力（数据）检查。",
	"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called Hacking and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account.": "任何一种非法或未经授权进入技术系统的行为都被称为黑客行为，需要使用（%0%），以及智力（数据）检查。一般来说，一个黑客尝试需要使用技术进行1分钟的工作，尽管GM可以决定某些任务可能只需要一个行动。在黑客检查成功后，你可以在系统上进行操作，就像你有完全的权限一样。如果检查失败，就掷一个D6。如果是6，设备就会被锁住，不能再尝试入侵它。更安全的设备可能会在掷出5或6时锁定，或在掷出4至6时锁定，由GM决定。你可以入侵设备，非法进入安全系统，打开一扇门，解除警报，或者操纵别人的数据包，让你获得他们的信息或银行账户。",
	"A new skill in Dark Matter, your Dexterity (Piloting) check covers how well you maintain control over a ship in difficult circumstances. You don't need proficiency in Piloting to fly a ship (be it an aircraft or a spacecraft), but proficiency in this skill can help when you need to make a crash landing or pull off a risky maneuver in a dogfight. The GM might call for a Dexterity (Piloting) check when you attempt to fly a ship through an electromagnetic storm that disrupts the controls, or when you wish to perform a hard stop or pull a high-G turn.": "作为《黑暗物质》的一项新技能，你的灵巧（驾驶）检查涵盖了你在困难情况下对飞船的控制能力。你不需要熟练掌握驾驶技能来驾驶飞船（无论是飞机还是航天器），但是当你需要进行迫降或者在斗狗中进行危险的操作时，熟练掌握这项技能会有所帮助。当你试图驾驶飞船通过破坏控制的电磁风暴时，或者当你希望进行硬停或高G转弯时，GM可能会要求你进行灵巧（驾驶）检查。",
	"Your Intelligence (Technology) check measures your ability to understand the inner workings of technological devices. Most devices are powered by some form of magic, but plenty of intricate design goes into channeling that magic into useful effects. Use this skill to understand unfamiliar or complex technology or to modify or repair devices. The GM may call for an Intelligence (Technology) check when you attempt to modify a blaster, repair your ship's {@item shield generator|darkmatter}, disable a rogue android, or sabotage an arcane terminal.": "你的智力（技术）检查衡量你了解技术设备内部运作的能力。大多数设备都是由某种形式的魔法驱动的，但大量复杂的设计都是为了将魔法转化为有用的效果。使用这个技能来了解不熟悉的或复杂的技术，或者修改或修理设备。当你试图改造一个爆破器，修理你的飞船（%0%），禁用一个流氓机器人，或破坏一个奥术终端时，GM可能会要求你进行智力（技术）检查。",

It's infamous for its heft, recoil, and stopping- power, and it is favored by gunslingers that accept no compromises.": "这种令人印象深刻的手枪，以其创造者马格努斯-奥普姆命名，重量几乎是连发枪的两倍。它因其重量、后坐力和阻止力而臭名昭著，受到不接受妥协的枪手们的青睐。",

	"The nodes mounted on this helmet's dome emit an invisible psionic field, amplified by the mind of anyone who wears it. By focusing on the helm and extending a hand, the user can even direct the field into a blast of psionic force.": "安装在这个头盔圆顶上的节点会发出一个无形的幻象场，被任何戴着它的人的思想所放大。通过集中注意力在头盔上并伸出一只手，使用者甚至可以将该领域引导为幻觉力量的爆炸。",
	"You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Dexterity, for this weapon's attack rolls.": "你可以使用你选择的智力、智慧或魅力，而不是灵巧，用于该武器的攻击卷。",
	"The Revolving Exothermic Cannon (or REC gun, for short) operates on the same principle as a conventional blaster, with an arcane battery hooked up to an aperture barrel and so forth, but mounts several blasters on a revolving cylinder, each firing in rapid succession.": "旋转式放热炮（简称REC炮）的工作原理与传统爆破器相同，将奥术电池与光圈炮管等连接起来，但在一个旋转的圆筒上安装了几个爆破器，每个都是快速连续发射。",
	"Less a blaster in the conventional sense, and more a stripped-down Dark Matter engine designed to rip a contained hole in the universe, the singularity emitter is a singularly destructive weapon. After being fired, however, the weapon must cool down, venting exceptional amounts of heat to maintain a stable Dark Matter core.": "与其说是传统意义上的爆破器，不如说是一个精简的暗物质引擎，旨在在宇宙中撕开一个封闭的洞，奇点发射器是一种独特的破坏性武器。然而，在发射之后，该武器必须冷却下来，释放出大量的热量以维持稳定的暗物质核心。",
	"When this weapon hits a target, each creature within 10 feet of the target is pulled up to 5 feet toward it.": "当此武器击中目标时，目标10英尺内的每个生物都会被拉向它，最多 5英尺。",
	"The flame-throwing volcanic consists of a set of tanks and a hefty arcane battery arranged into a backpack, connected by a hose to the gun. The gun itself is essentially a nozzle and trigger for the weapon's volatile incendiary spray, which chars any organic target in seconds.": "火焰喷射器由一组坦克和一个巨大的奥术电池组成，排列在一个背包里，通过软管与枪连接。枪本身基本上是一个喷嘴和触发器，用于武器的挥发性燃烧物喷射，可以在几秒钟内烧毁任何有机目标。",
	"Whenever you make an attack with this weapon, it spews flames in a 15-foot radius cone. Each creature within that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage.": "每当你用这个武器进行攻击时，它就会在一个15英尺半径的圆锥体中喷出火焰。该区域内的每个生物都必须做一个DC14的灵巧蓄力动作，否则会受到2D6的火焰伤害。",
	"Favored by assassins and infiltrators, the antimatter dagger produces a short blade of crackling energy. With some skill, this weapon can be hidden up a sleeve, stashed in a belt, or secreted away in a hidden compartment, to be revealed at the right moment for a precision kill.": "反物质匕首受到刺客和潜入者的青睐，它能产生噼里啪啦能量的短刃。通过一些技巧，这种武器可以藏在袖子里，藏在腰带上，或者藏在一个隐蔽的隔间里，在适当的时候露出来，进行精确的杀戮。",

On a strike, the gloves magnify kinetic energy at the knuckles and issue a deafening crack.": "这些手套的特点是在手掌上有一个圆柱形的抓手，可以加强拳头的力量，并给安装在指关节上的一组雷电电池充电。在击打时，手套会在指关节处放大动能，并发出震耳欲聋的裂纹。",
	"When activated, these gloves project dazzling, razor-sharp claws from the fingertips, which can be used to shred a foe to ribbons.": "激活后，这些手套会从指尖投射出令人眼花缭乱的锋利的爪子，可以用来将敌人撕成碎片。",

	"A mechanical, articulating gauntlet, this weapon slips over a hand and mimics its movements. A battlefist can deliver crushing blows on its own, but is usually paired with another weapon, such as a blaster, to be employed when enemies draw too near. This weapon is especially favored by the vect, who can integrate one in place of a hand to ensure a weapon is always nearby.": "这种武器是一种机械的、可铰接的铠甲，它可以滑到手上并模仿其动作。战拳可以单独提供粉碎性打击，但通常与另一种武器配对，如爆破枪，以便在敌人过于接近时使用。这种武器尤其受到中士的青睐，他们可以用它来代替一只手，以确保武器始终在附近。",
	"This weapon acts as an oversized, articulated gauntlet. It can hold and manipulate objects, though you can't attack with your battlefist while you're holding an object with it.": "这种武器就像一个超大的、有关节的护手。它可以握住并操纵物体，不过当你用它握住物体时，你不能用战拳进行攻击。",
	"The strange, two-foot long rod wielded by wrothians is composed of a glistening, exotic crystal which pulls against an underlying field in the universe. Moving it around reveals a strange resistance, as any speed, an invisible wave of force extends feet from the rod, bashing any obstacles in front of it.": "wrothians挥舞的奇怪的两英尺长的棒子是由一种闪闪发光的异国水晶组成的，它与宇宙中的一个潜在的场拉扯。在周围移动它时，会发现一种奇怪的阻力，因为任何速度，一种无形的力量波都会从棒子上延伸出来，撞击它前面的任何障碍。",
	"This laser sword of shorter hilt and half-blade length is normally wielded in pairs, making a light complement for deft two-weapon fighters.": "这种激光剑的剑柄较短，半刃长，通常是成对挥舞，为灵巧的双兵器战士提供轻盈的补充。",
	"An elegant weapon, for a more enlightened age, the laser sword consists of a metal hilt which projects a fixed-length laser when activated. Its weightless blade makes for an agile, deadly weapon capable of cutting through many materials. The sword could even stop a blaster bolt, but alas, one would need precognition and superhuman reflexes to do so.": "激光剑是一种优雅的武器，适用于更开明的时代，它由一个金属剑柄组成，激活后会发射出固定长度的激光。它没有重量的剑身使其成为一种灵活、致命的武器，能够切割许多材料。这把剑甚至可以阻止爆破弹，但可惜的是，人们需要预知能力和超人的反应来做到这一点。",
	"Depending on this weapon's construction, it can deal force, necrotic, or radiant damage. Once the weapon is created, this damage type doesn't change.": "根据这个武器的构造，它可以造成力量、坏死或辐射伤害。一旦武器被制造出来，这种伤害类型就不会改变。",
	"A wicked weapon favored by the elves, the photonic lash produces a bright tendril of energy from its metal hilt. The lash leaves painful, burning lacerations on its victims, along with lasting scars—a tell-tale sign that one has defied the whims of the high elves.": "光子鞭是精灵们喜欢的邪恶武器，它的金属柄上会产生明亮的能量卷轴。鞭子会在受害者身上留下痛苦、灼热的裂痕，以及持久的疤痕--这是一个人违抗高等精灵奇想的明显标志。",
	"Few things are as intimidating as a plasma cutter's circular, white-hot blade. When used in normal operation to carve up high-density metal plates, it can easily remove careless fingers or limbs, but if wielded with lethal intent, it can cleanly dissect someone from end to end.": "很少有东西能像等离子切割机的圆形白热刀片那样令人生畏。当在正常操作中用来雕刻高密度金属板时，它可以轻易地切除粗心的手指或肢体，但如果带着致命的意图挥舞，它可以干净地将一个人从头到尾解剖。",
	"This weapon ignores the damage threshold of nonmagical objects that it cuts.": "该武器无视它所切割的非魔法物体的伤害阈值。",
	"Similar to a battlefist, but larger in scale, this hulking gauntlet invariably throws its users off-balance. Concealed within it is an arcane battery from a blaster, which the gauntlet channels into the knuckles to augment its blows with layered forcefields.": "与战拳相似，但规模更大，这个巨大的战铠总是能让使用者失去平衡。它里面隐藏着一个来自爆破器的奥术电池，铠甲将其导入指关节，用分层力场增强其打击力。",
	"Only the dwarves would conceive of a weapon so unwieldy as the rocket hammer. As its name implies, it is very much a conventional warhammer with a rocket thruster built into the head to magnify its bludgeoning potential.": "只有矮人会设想出像火箭锤这样笨重的武器。正如它的名字所暗示的那样，它在很大程度上是一把传统的战锤，头部装有火箭推进器，以放大其打击潜力。",
	"Once per turn, when you make an attack with this weapon, you can engage its thrusters to deal an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.": "每回合一次，当你用此武器进行攻击时，你可以启动它的推进器，在命中时造成额外的1d4重击伤害。",
	"When a button on this metal tube is pressed, a persistent, foot-long blue stream of flame erupts from its end, scorching those it touches. Though this tool was fashioned for mining asteroids for precious minerals, it has become a favorite (albeit eccentric) choice of weapon for avia-ra warriors.": "当这个金属管上的按钮被按下时，一股持续的、一英尺长的蓝色火焰流从其末端喷出，烧焦它所接触的人。虽然这个工具是为开采小行星上的珍贵矿物而制造的，但它已成为阿维亚拉战士最喜欢的（尽管是古怪的）武器选择。",
	"Though different models exist, the most common by far is the Wrenchinator 9000, a tool used by starship mechanics the 'verse over. This incredible oversized wrench can fasten bolts, loosen bolts, and clobber people over the head.": "虽然存在不同的型号，但到目前为止，最常见的是Wrenchinator 9000，这是一个由星际飞船机械师使用的工具。这种令人难以置信的超大尺寸扳手可以紧固螺栓、松开螺栓，还可以敲打人的头部。",

	"As a general rule, magic doesn't exist in science fiction. Any spectacular event can be spoiled with a few sentences of technobabble, explaining away the magic answer and replacing it with science. In fact, this is a core tenet of many science fiction franchises, as codified by Arthur C. Clarke's immortal declaration that": "一般来说，科幻小说中不存在魔法。任何壮观的事件都可以用几句技术废话来破坏，解释掉神奇的答案，用科学来取代它。事实上，这是许多科幻小说系列的核心原则，正如阿瑟-克拉克（Arthur C. Clarke）的不朽宣言所规定的那样，即",
	"In other words, magical things can always be dismissed with science.": "换句话说，神奇的东西总是可以用科学来否定的。",
	"When you dive into the universe of Dark Matter, you'll find that quite the inverse is true: magic has become so advanced that it seems like high technology. Those blasters are highly-developed evocation wands, that flying car is using a permanent levitate spell, and traveling faster than the speed of light is simply an advanced application of teleportation magic.": "当你潜入《黑暗物质》的宇宙时，你会发现情况恰恰相反：魔法已经变得如此先进，以至于它看起来像高科技。那些爆破器是高度发达的唤醒魔杖，那辆飞车使用的是永久悬浮法术，而比光速更快的旅行只不过是传送魔法的高级应用。",
	"In Dark Matter, fantasy and science fiction can live side-by-side: the universe is filled to the brim with huge starships, innumerable alien creatures and planets, and all sorts of blasters, jetpacks, and power armor. It's also populated with dragons, demons, giants, and strange alien creatures to be met and slain. Axe-wielding barbarians clad in furs can stand alongside machine-gun toting androids, facing down alien horrors on the deck of a derelict space cruiser; trinket-festooned wizards and power armored space commandos can plot together to take down a dragon that lives in an asteroid made of solid gold; and lute-strumming bards can perform and garner fame in every hive of scum and villainy on the outer rim of the galaxy.": "在《黑暗物质》中，幻想和科幻可以并存：宇宙中充满了巨大的星舰、无数的外星生物和行星，以及各种爆破器、喷气背包和动力装甲。它也充满了龙、恶魔、巨人和奇怪的外星生物，有待于我们去迎接和杀戮。挥舞着斧头的野蛮人身披毛皮，可以和手持机枪的机器人站在一起，在一艘废弃的太空巡洋舰的甲板上面对外星恐怖；戴着饰品的巫师和身穿动力装甲的太空突击队员可以一起策划，打倒住在纯金小行星上的龙；弹着琵琶的吟游诗人可以在银河系外缘的每个人渣和小人窝里表演并获得名声。",
	"At its core, Dark Matter is a love letter to our favorite science fiction franchises, and an acknowledgment that science fiction in general need not be divorced from fantasy. The best sci-fi, from Star Wars to Dune, is filled with fantastic elements: mystical space-wizards, laser swords, precognition, and unusual alien abilities, to name a few. None of them seem all that out of place in high fantasy, yet the two are irreparably divorced. Of course, the distinction is mostly an aesthetic one—sci-fi outfits its magic in sleek metal, whereas high fantasy uses glowing arcane runes. Dark Matter is our attempt to bridge that gap.": "黑暗物质》的核心是一封写给我们最喜爱的科幻小说系列的情书，也是对科幻小说一般不需要脱离幻想的承认。最好的科幻作品，从《星球大战》到《沙丘》，都充满了神奇的元素：神秘的太空巫师、激光剑、预知能力和不寻常的外星人能力，仅举几例。这些元素在高级幻想中似乎都没有什么不合适的地方，但这两者却有着不可弥补的分离。当然，这种区别主要是审美上的区别，科幻小说用光滑的金属装备其魔法，而高级幻想小说则使用发光的奥术符文。黑暗物质》是我们弥补这一差距的尝试。",
	"Somewhere out there in the Dark Matter universe, every conceivable world—from the medieval domains of wizards and dragons to the high-tech alien planets of your favorite sci-fi franchise—waits to be discovered. Your own campaign world is out there, too, perhaps blissfully unaware that alien starships dogfight high above, exchanging blaster fire for the fate of the galaxy.": "在黑暗物质宇宙的某个地方，每一个可以想象的世界--从中世纪的巫师和龙的领域到你最喜欢的科幻特许经营中的高科技外星星球--都在等待被发现。你自己的战役世界也在那里，也许你不知道外星战舰在高空交火，为了银河系的命运而交换高射炮火。",

	"\"What can I say? You've got a good arm there.\"": "\"我能说什么呢？你有一个好的手臂。\"",

	"Rami knew that this small prison, tucked away in the bowels of the Solar Citadel, held only two types of prisoners: immensely powerful criminals apprehended by the Sepulcher Knights, and dumb thugs like this one, who tried one too many times to escape their previous jail. Moreover, one of the few things that might prompt an intervention from the bird-headed would be the death of a prisoner. She would have to tread lightly; loosing the full force of her power against this fool could spoil her eventual escape, or worse, cost her the map.": "拉米知道，这个隐藏在太阳城中心的小监狱，只关押了两种类型的囚犯：被海贼王骑士团逮捕的无比强大的罪犯，以及像这个人一样的愚蠢的暴徒，他们曾多次试图逃离他们以前的监狱。此外，可能促使鸟头人干预的少数事情之一是囚犯的死亡。她必须轻装上阵；对这个傻瓜失去全部力量可能会破坏她最终的逃跑，或者更糟的是，使她失去地图。",
	"And besides, it was much more fun if they thought they stood a chance. Rami muttered a word and flicked her wrist, summoning a spectral hand to slap him full in the face. \"Bold of you to assume you can.\"": "此外，如果他们认为自己有机会，那就更有趣了。拉米嘀咕了一句，弹了弹手腕，召唤出一只幽灵般的手，给了他一记耳光。\"你大胆地认为你可以。\"",
	"His smirk evaporated. \"Oh, you're real funny, grue, but you sure ain't smart. You even know who the old man is? He's a Scale & Fang elite, they say. Got connections across the 'verse.\"": "他的笑脸消失了。\"哦，你真的很有趣，格鲁伊，但你肯定不聪明。你甚至知道那老头是谁吗？他们说，他是天秤和方块的精英。在整个'诗篇'中都有关系。\"",

	"\"You black-hearted wretch!\" the thug shouted as he threw another clumsy hook.": "\"你这个黑心的小人！\"暴徒一边喊着，一边又扔出一个笨拙的钩子。",
	"A few seconds later, he was sprawled out on the canteen floor and the rest of his gang were preparing to pile in. Clearly the old man had never stopped making friends. Every lowlife in this place seemed to have his back. Rami dug through her memory for a spell which didn't require material components. Invisibility? No, that needs gum arabic. Silent image? Rami doubted her roughspun fatigues would count as fleece. Aha! Sleep might do the trick: Rami reached for a pinch of sand—the Citadel's floor held no shortage of that—and started forming somatic components.": "几秒钟后，他躺在了食堂的地板上，他的其他帮派成员正准备堆在一起。显然，这个老人从未停止过交朋友。这个地方的每一个低等人似乎都在支持他。拉米在她的记忆中挖出了一个不需要物质成分的咒语。隐身术？不，那需要阿拉伯胶。无声影像？拉米怀疑她的粗纺工作服能否算作绒毛。啊哈! 睡觉可能会有效果。拉米伸手拿了一撮沙子--城堡的地板上不乏这样的沙子--然后开始形成体细胞成分。",
	"The faces of Rami's opponents exhibited a mixture of confusion and concern as she enchanted the sand, then a brief flash of horror as the bewitched grains flew towards the corners of their eyes. Within moments, a half-dozen of them had drifted off to sleep and collapsed in a pile. Rami sensed her opening.": "拉米的对手们在她给沙子施魔法时，脸上表现出困惑和担忧，然后在被施了魔法的沙粒飞向他们的眼角时，脸上闪过一丝惊恐。不一会儿，他们中的半打人已经昏昏欲睡，倒在了一堆。拉米感觉到了她的开口。",
	"She darted forward, evading one thug and shoving another back with a gust of magical wind. One managed to hit her with a thrown boot, but the glancing blow didn't slow her dash toward the exit.": "她飞快地向前冲，躲开了一个暴徒，用一阵魔法风把另一个暴徒推了回去。有一个人设法用扔出的靴子打中了她，但这一闪而过的打击并没有减缓她冲向出口的速度。",
	"To her shock, the door swung open and a trio of avia-ra wardens strode in, golden sunstaves ablaze with radiant energy. Wordless, they set about the room, smiting prisoners left and right as if putting down a full-scale riot. Which perhaps it was, in their view; this wasn't the sort of dungeon that usually inspired its inmates to rampage.": "令她震惊的是，门被打开了，三个阿维亚拉看守人大步走了进来，金色的太阳穴燃烧着璀璨的能量。他们无声无息地在房间里走来走去，左冲右突，仿佛在镇压一场全面的暴乱。在他们看来，也许是这样；这不是那种通常会激发囚犯暴动的地牢。",
	"As a brawl developed all around, the grue wizard skirted the edges, keeping out of the way as far as possible and relying on her agility to evade any attacks that came her way. It seemed that no more guards were coming, so if she could just slip past these three, freedom might still be on the cards.": "随着周围的争斗的发展，这个格鲁族巫师绕到了边缘，尽可能地避开，并依靠她的敏捷性来躲避任何向她袭来的攻击。似乎没有更多的守卫会来，所以如果她能溜过这三个人，自由可能仍然在望。",
	"Cursing her lack of gum arabic, Rami drew on all the tricks she'd learned in her many years of thievery. The well-lit canteen left no shadows for her to skulk through, and she could only avoid notice for a scant few seconds before one of the wardens cut off her escape. The other prisoners, armed only with plastic cutlery and futile rage, were quickly subdued, leaving Rami the last one standing, backed into a corner. The coppery smell of the glowing sunstaves filled her nose.": "拉米诅咒自己没有阿拉伯口香糖，她使用了多年来偷窃过程中学到的所有技巧。光线充足的食堂没有给她留下任何阴影，她只能躲避几秒钟，就被一名狱警截住了逃跑的路线。其他囚犯只有塑料餐具和徒劳的愤怒，很快就被制服了，剩下拉米是最后一个站着的人，被逼到了角落。发光的太阳穴的铜臭味充斥着她的鼻子。",
	"\"Come on, feathers,\" she hissed, \"what're you waiting for?\" Though the answer was clear: she could see glittering fire in their beady eyes. They were savoring their petty triumph. Switching gears to plan B—fighting her way out—Rami bared her teeth and began forming somatic components...": "\"来吧，羽毛，\"她嘶吼道，\"你还在等什么？\" 虽然答案很清楚：她可以看到它们炯炯有神的眼睛里闪烁着火焰。他们正在品尝他们的小胜利。转向B计划--争取她的出路--拉米呲牙咧嘴，开始形成体液成分......",
	"To a terrestrial adventurer, the scale of the galaxy can be mind-bending and a bit frightening. It betrays much of what their senses tell them: the land on which they walk is down, the sky is up, the sun goes from east to west. The idea that \"up\" is in all directions, or that there is no constant \"down,\" or that your world is but a speck of the cosmic whole is antithetical to nearly everything they've ever learned. However, for those adventurers who can muster the courage to brave the starry skies, to strike out into the unknown, and to take their first bold steps into the night, untold treasures are there to be had.": "对于一个陆地上的冒险家来说，银河系的规模可能是令人心惊肉跳的，而且有点可怕。它背叛了他们的感官告诉他们的许多东西：他们行走的土地是向下的，天空是向上的，太阳从东到西。\"向上 \"是指所有方向，或者没有恒定的 \"向下\"，或者你的世界只是宇宙整体中的一个小点，这种想法几乎与他们所学到的一切背道而驰。然而，对于那些能够鼓起勇气勇敢面对星空的冒险家来说，向未知领域进军，向黑夜迈出大胆的第一步，就会有数不清的宝藏。",

Facilitating their journeys are the maws, which (in conjunction with their starships) allow them to travel between stars and vast stretches of galaxy by jumping through the Void. From the markets on the maws to the inner workings of their own ships, they'll come across an endless array of magical technology, from the simple blaster to the intricate Dark Matter drive. Equipment in hand, it is on them to find purpose, meaning, and potentially profit in the galaxy; there is a nearly endless amount of adventuring and exploring to be done, a wide variety of races and factions to engage with or work for, and plenty of deadly hazards to avoid.": "银河系是星际旅行者消磨时间的地方，他们在世界之间的虚无空间--\"黑 \"中规划自己的道路。为他们的旅行提供便利的是大嘴，它（与他们的星际飞船一起）允许他们通过跳过虚空在恒星和广阔的星系之间旅行。从大嘴的市场到他们自己飞船的内部结构，他们会遇到无穷无尽的神奇技术，从简单的爆破器到复杂的暗物质驱动。装备到手后，他们就可以在银河系中找到目的、意义和潜在的利润；这里有几乎无穷无尽的冒险和探索，有各种各样的种族和派别可以参与或为之工作，还有很多致命的危险需要避免。",

This featureless, cold, and lifeless vacuum is often referred to by spacers as \"the Black.\" It is truly ubiquitous, for every world in the 'verse floats within it.": "尽管银河系中的恒星、行星和其他天体的数量确实惊人，但它们总共只占银河系体积的不到百分之一。事实上，太空中充满了深不可测的空虚。这种没有特征、冰冷、没有生命的真空常常被太空人称为 \"黑色\"。它确实无处不在，因为 \"诗篇 \"中的每个世界都漂浮在其中。",
	"The massive expanse of the Black is the single greatest challenge to all long-distance space travel. While travel between planets in a single star system is possible for slower vessels, to cross even the shortest stretch of Black between habitable worlds without faster-than-light (FTL) travel takes many human lifetimes (and even a few elven lifetimes). Lack of air, food, water, and light means that life support systems are essential for any interstellar journey, and to find yourself stranded means slow, certain death (assuming a rogue burst of radiation or a stray asteroid doesn't speed up the process). While powerful terrestrial mages can cross a planet with a wave of their hand and a magic word or two, spells of that nature (such as teleport) don't penetrate far into the Black, nor can similar spells that utilize planar travel.": "巨大的黑子是所有长距离太空旅行的最大挑战。虽然对于较慢的船只来说，在单个恒星系统中的行星之间旅行是可能的，但在没有超光速（FTL）旅行的情况下，即使是在最短的黑域之间穿越，也需要许多人类的生命（甚至是几个精灵的生命）。缺少空气、食物、水和光意味着生命支持系统对于任何星际旅行都是必不可少的，而发现自己被搁浅意味着缓慢而肯定的死亡（假设一个无赖的辐射爆发或一颗流散的小行星没有加速这一过程）。虽然强大的陆地法师可以通过挥手和一两个魔法词来穿越一个星球，但这种性质的法术（如传送）并不能深入到黑子里，类似的利用平面旅行的法术也不能。",
	"No obstacle in the Black is as perilous and impassable as {@b Dead Magic Zones}. In these areas, where the magic of the 'verse has worn thin and ripped wholly asunder, no magic functions, including that which powers ships and drives Dark Matter engines. Navigation systems fail, life support fizzles out, and engines go silent. Finding oneself in one of these zones without a nonmagical means of escape is truly a death sentence.": "黑域中没有任何障碍物像{@b Dead Magic Zones}那样危险和无法通过。在这些地区，'诗篇'的魔力已经消磨殆尽，完全被撕裂，没有任何魔力可以发挥作用，包括为船只提供动力和驱动暗物质引擎的魔力。导航系统失灵，生命支持系统消失，引擎也变得沉默。如果发现自己身处这些区域，而又没有非魔法的逃生手段，那真是一个死刑判决。",
	"Though Dead Magic Zones might appear fixed in place on a map, their boundaries are ever-shifting and churning; they warp, grow, shrink, separate, and merge, all seemingly at random. The largest masses of dead magic appear largely static, but only on the scale of lifetimes. Over millennia, through constant, imperceptible motions, they too move across the 'verse, swallowing some worlds and releasing others as they move.": "虽然死亡魔法区在地图上看起来是固定的，但它们的边界是不断变化和翻腾的；它们扭曲、增长、缩小、分离和合并，所有这些似乎都是随机的。最大的死亡魔法群在很大程度上是静止的，但只是在一生中的规模。几千年来，通过不断的、难以察觉的运动，它们也在'诗篇'中移动，在移动中吞噬一些世界，释放其他世界。",
	"Worlds that lie deep within Dead Magic Zones are considered by many to be lost worlds, inaccessible and cut off from the universe. The gnomish homeworld of Nebellion is one such world, and as a result, gnomish tinkers have developed marvels of science that function and power themselves without the use of magic, even achieving Void-based FTL.

An utterly massive star—one which defies all logic in its continued existence—sits in a slow, orbiting dance with an equally large, tidally-locked black hole. While exceptionally little is known about the star itself, the avia-ra (as well as several other groups) claim that it is the holiest site in the 'verse; the avia-ra's holy city, the {@b Solar Citadel}, orbits this very body. Many of their oldest scripts (which contain some of the first written lore in the galaxy) state that at the center of the so-called Sepulcher Star sits the First God, the carver of the maws, the true creator of the stars (and of all creation), the {@b Old Un}.": "坐落在银河系中心的景象引发了超越、疯狂和神圣的十字军东征：伟大的（%0%）。一颗完全巨大的恒星--它的持续存在违背了所有的逻辑--与一个同样大的、被潮汐锁定的黑洞缓慢地在轨道上跳舞。虽然对这颗恒星本身知之甚少，但阿维亚拉人（以及其他几个团体）声称它是 \"诗篇 \"中最神圣的地方；阿维亚拉人的圣城，{@b Solar Citadel}，正是围绕着这颗星体运行。他们许多最古老的手稿（包含银河系中一些最早的书面传说）说，在所谓的墓穴星的中心，坐着第一神，大嘴的雕刻者，星星（和所有创造物）的真正创造者，（%2%）。",
	"Indeed, sophisticated scans have verified that some structure exists in the core of the star: a sepulcher composed of incomprehensibly strong exotic metals that can withstand the perpetual inferno. But this is not the star's only mystery, for the Sepulcher Star is far too massive to be as old as it is; by all rights, it should have burnt out billions of years ago under its own mass. As its orbit closes in on The Core's black hole, it sheds even more mass, and yet continues to survive. Within a few hundred thousand years, however, the star is likely to be consumed by the black hole altogether.": "事实上，复杂的扫描已经验证了这颗恒星的核心存在某种结构：一个由难以理解的强壮的外来金属组成的墓穴，可以抵御永久的地狱之火。但这并不是这颗恒星唯一的谜团，因为墓穴星的质量太大，不可能像现在这样古老；按理说，它应该在几十亿年前就在自己的质量下烧毁了。当它的轨道接近核心的黑洞时，它脱落的质量甚至更多，但仍继续生存。然而，在几十万年内，这颗恒星很可能就会被黑洞完全吞噬。",
	"The fact that the Knights of the Sepulcher, as well as other individuals, can draw magical power through the colossal star also lends some credence to its power. That the Sepulcher Star contains something of immense might is unquestionable, but the nature of what dwells within the star is completely mysterious. Perhaps Old Un is a being of light and creation, retired in its venerable age to rest within the star, or maybe Un is a malicious creature of the Void, or an Old God of the Far Realm, imprisoned within the star until the universe's end. Or perhaps the truth is stranger still; all that is known for certain is that Un is powerful and inexorably ancient.": "墓穴骑士以及其他个人可以通过这颗巨大的星体汲取魔力，这一事实也让人对它的力量有了一定的信心。墓穴之星包含着巨大的力量，这是毋庸置疑的，但居住在这颗星中的东西的性质是完全神秘的。也许 \"老吽 \"是一个光和创造的生命，在其古老的年代里退休，在星体中休息，或者 \"老吽 \"是虚空中的一个恶意生物，或者是远界的一个老神，被囚禁在星体中，直到宇宙的结束。或者真相更奇怪；所有已知的肯定是 \"吽 \"的强大和不可阻挡的古老。",
	"Were it not for the maws, galactic civilization couldn't exist on the grand scale that it currently does. These massive, antediluvian bones are the remnants of some colossal and long-extinct breed of voidbeast, reinforced with ancient machinery and clutching a massive portal into the Void within their jaws (hence the name). These portals are linked to one another in a network, allowing space travelers to perform perfectly-controlled jumps between the maws, crossing the 'verse with ease. No one is completely certain how the maws work, or who originally constructed them, but they have nonetheless become the backbone of galactic trade. Discovering the maws was a catalyst for the rapid expansion and colonization of the galaxy thousands of years ago, and their importance hasn't lessened since. Acting as a rapid transit network for ships, which can cross the galaxy in mere days, the maw stations connect the galactic empires, act as a neutral meeting ground for intrepid travelers, and form the cornerstone of galactic trade. Each maw station is a vibrant, multicultural trade city and spaceport, playing host to creatures of all sizes and shapes from across the 'verse. If something is to be bought or sold (legally or illegally), it is likely to be found on a maw.": "如果没有大嘴，银河系的文明就不可能像现在这样大规模地存在。这些巨大的、超前的骨骼是某种巨大的、早已灭绝的虚空兽的残骸，用古老的机械加固，在它们的嘴里攥着一个进入虚空的巨大门户（因此而得名）。这些门户在一个网络中相互连接，允许太空旅行者在大口之间进行完美控制的跳跃，轻松地穿越'se'。没有人完全确定大嘴的工作原理，也没有人知道最初是谁建造了它们，但它们还是成为银河系贸易的支柱。几千年前，发现巨口是银河系快速扩张和殖民化的催化剂，此后它们的重要性一直没有降低。作为船舶的快速运输网络，马口站可以在短短几天内穿越银河系，它连接着银河系的各个帝国，作为无畏的旅行者的中立会面场所，并形成银河系贸易的基石。每个巨口站都是一个充满活力的、多文化的贸易城市和太空港，接待来自整个宇宙的各种尺寸和形状的生物。如果要买或卖什么东西（合法或非法），很可能会在巨口站找到。",
	"Unlike most outposts in the galaxy, the maws are uniformly neutral. All beings, even those from far-off planes of existence, are welcome to traverse the stations freely, without fear of reprisal. Demons and angels may be found sharing tables in taverns, chaos beasts can be found haggling with contract keepers from the Plane of Law over shipping manifests, and the bitterest of rival races may hammer out treaties between their peoples in the main courts. Maintaining this peace and neutrality are two unique groups: the amoeboids, a caretaker race of vaguely humanoid, translucent oozes native to the maws, and the Order of the Sepulcher, a relatively new organization of peacekeepers. Though the elves were the first humanoid race to discover and use the maws for their intended purpose, their creation and creator are shrouded in mystery. Only a few pieces of that mystery have been uncovered, the most prominent being the amoeboids themselves. Given that they are the only creatures native to the maws, they seem to be tasked with the continued upkeep and maintenance of the stations, and are especially apt to do so. However, the amoeboids' histories contain no record of their origins, or indeed, on the origins of the maws. Galactic Frontier. There is but one exception to the maw network's absolute connectivity: the links to the outermost ring of stations are one-way, allowing transit out to this outer-edge of the galaxy, but not back. Moreover, the outer ring itself enjoys only intermittent connectivity between stations, with an almost 25% chance for a failed jump between outer maws. As such, this far- removed swath of space, called the Galactic Frontier, is as unexplored as it is lawless.": "与银河系中的大多数前哨站不同，Maws是统一的中立。所有的生命，甚至那些来自遥远存在的星球的生命，都被欢迎自由地穿越这些站点，而不用担心遭到报复。恶魔和天使可以在酒馆里同桌共饮，混沌兽可以和来自法律世界的合同管理人在航运清单上讨价还价，最激烈的敌对种族可以在主要法庭上敲定他们民族之间的条约。维持这种和平与中立的是两个独特的群体：阿莫博伊德（amoeboids）和墓穴骑士团（Order of the Sepulcher），前者是一个看守种族，隐约可见的人形，半透明渗出物，原产于大嘴。虽然精灵是第一个发现并使用巨口的人形种族，但他们的创造和创造者都被笼罩在神秘之中。这个谜团只有少数部分被揭开，最突出的是变形虫本身。鉴于它们是唯一原产于巨口的生物，它们似乎被赋予了持续维护和保养这些站点的任务，而且特别愿意这样做。然而，变形金刚的历史中没有关于它们的起源的记录，实际上也没有关于Maws的起源的记录。银河边疆。在巨嘴网络的绝对连通性方面只有一个例外：与最外环的站点的联系是单向的，允许向银河系的外缘过境，但不能返回。此外，外环本身只享有车站之间的间歇性连接，在外爪之间跳跃失败的几率几乎为25%。因此，这片被称为 \"银河边疆 \"的遥远空间，既未被开发，又无法无天。",

Through different lenses, wizards, engineers, alchemists, and scientists all struggle to understand its fundamental mysteries, but nothing exposes their ignorance more so than the Void.": "就其核心而言，宇宙似乎是建立在不可理解的基础上。通过不同的视角，巫师、工程师、炼金术士和科学家都在努力理解它的基本奥秘，但没有什么比虚空更能暴露他们的无知了。",
	"The {@b Void} is not a plane of existence like the Material or Elemental planes; in fact, it is very much their opposite. The Void represents the space between planes, the absence of everything, containing nothing—not sound, nor space, nor time.

	"By entering the Void and traveling through it, ships can leap vast distances in the blink of an eye. In such a process, called a {@b Void Jump}, ships are warped to an infinitesimal size for the briefest possible time, from which they can take a step in any direction and hop across the universe. Greater jumps require more energy, but allow longer steps from the Void through the 'verse; doing so, of course, is extremely perilous.": "通过进入虚空并在其中旅行，飞船可以在一眨眼的时间内飞跃很远的距离。在这种被称为\"%0%\"的过程中，飞船在最短的时间内被扭曲成一个无限小的尺寸，从那里它们可以向任何方向迈出一步，跳过宇宙。更大的跳跃需要更多的能量，但允许从虚空中穿过'诗篇'的更长步骤；当然，这样做是非常危险的。",
	"Paradoxically, the Void is filled with streams of hideous lights, which filter in from the most gravitationally extreme parts of all other universes and planes of existence. Because the Void has no substance and is adjacent to all possible realities, only the most energetic radiation passes into it, all of which is antithetical to living things. Any creature exposed to the Void is irrevocably changed, hideously mutated in a process called 'the warp.' To avoid such a fate, most pilots jump blind from behind protective blast shields, relying only on tenuous magical navigation. Even technological assists fail and are burned out in the Void; unless protected beneath a thick, metallic hull, nothing withstands its ravages for long.": "矛盾的是，虚空充满了可怕的光流，这些光流从所有其他宇宙和存在平面的引力最极端的地方过滤进来。因为虚空没有物质，而且与所有可能的现实相邻，所以只有能量最强的辐射进入其中，所有这些都是与生物相反的。任何暴露在虚空中的生物都会发生不可逆转的变化，在一个被称为 \"扭曲 \"的过程中发生可怕的变异。 为了避免这样的命运，大多数飞行员从保护性的爆炸盾牌后面盲目跳下，只依靠脆弱的魔法导航。即使是技术辅助工具也会在虚空中失败并被烧毁；除非在厚实的金属船体下得到保护，否则没有任何东西能长期抵御虚空的蹂躏。",
	"It is exceptionally difficult to access the Void from the confines of planetary gravity, making in-atmosphere void jumps all but impossible.": "从行星引力的范围内进入虚空是非常困难的，这使得大气层内的虚空跳跃几乎不可能。",
	"Even though the universe of Dark Matter is filled with strange and fascinating worlds, it is still possible to find oneself on the Elemental Plane of Fire or swimming in the Ethereal Plane. The various planes of existence can be thought of as alternate dimensions, different layers of the dimension that makes up reality. Some of these planes, like the Elemental Planes, can be accessed from anywhere, whereas others, like demiplanes and planes related to the afterlives of specific faiths, can only be accessed from certain parts of the universe, on certain worlds, or if other special requirements are met.": "尽管暗物质的宇宙充满了奇怪而迷人的世界，但仍有可能发现自己在火元素位面或在空灵位面游泳。各种存在的平面可以被认为是替代的维度，是构成现实的维度的不同层次。其中一些平面，如元素平面，可以从任何地方进入，而其他平面，如半平面和与特定信仰的来世有关的平面，只能从宇宙的某些地方、某些世界进入，或满足其他特殊要求。",
	"The universe of Dark Matter also introduces the Void, a dimensionless realm beyond and between all the other planes. It can be useful to think about the Void as being a baseline dimension; it represents what's left over when all the other layers of reality have been stripped away, leaving nothing, not even space or time.": "暗物质的宇宙还引入了虚空，一个超越所有其他平面的无维度领域。把虚空想成一个基准维度可能是有用的；它代表了当现实的所有其他层面被剥离后剩下的东西，什么都没有留下，甚至没有空间或时间。",
	"Generally, it is impossible to use spells like plane shift for an interplanar shortcut across the universe, but the Void provides a unique exception. However, void jumps are only possible on the Material Plane; the void crystals which power them are dangerously unstable and will spontaneously collapse if brought to another plane.": "一般来说，不可能使用像平面转移这样的法术来实现跨越宇宙的星际捷径，但虚空提供了一个独特的例外。然而，虚空跳跃只有在物质位面才有可能；为其提供动力的虚空水晶是危险的不稳定的，如果被带到另一个位面就会自发崩溃。",

	"When most humanoids eat a live roach, a mind- expanding wave of euphoria and vivid hallucinations, known as \"the mists,\" washes over them.

	"Roaches can't be bred in most places, even with good nutrition and habitats. Very few worlds, which apparently lie along unseen intersections in the universe's ley lines, can sustain roach life and allow for new roach broods. Roaches that are taken off-world promptly become infertile and normally die after about a year. Of course, only living roaches cause the mists, so trade of these creatures is extremely competitive.": "蟑螂在大多数地方都不能被繁殖，即使有良好的营养和栖息地。很少有世界，显然是位于宇宙雷系的看不见的交叉点上，可以维持蟑螂的生命，并允许新的蟑螂繁殖。被带出世界的蟑螂会迅速变得不孕不育，通常在大约一年后死亡。当然，只有活着的蟑螂才会引起迷雾，所以这些生物的交易是非常有竞争力的。",
	"The crippling psychological addiction isn't the only downside of eating live roaches. Despite their size, roaches are weakly psychic, and can empathetically communicate simple ideas to creatures around them. Strong emotions, like fear and affection, come across most vividly. It is probably some psychic effect at the moment of their deaths that causes the mists, which explains why alchemists have been unable to replicate it. Regardless, more than one pilot has stopped eating roaches—and willingly endured the terrible withdrawal period—simply because the pangs of guilt had grown too much to bear.": "残缺的心理成瘾并不是吃活蟑螂的唯一缺点。尽管蟑螂体型庞大，但它们的灵性很弱，能以同理心将简单的想法传达给周围的生物。强烈的情感，如恐惧和爱意，会表现得淋漓尽致。可能是它们死亡时的某种精神效应导致了迷雾，这解释了为什么炼金术士无法复制它。不管怎么说，不止一个飞行员停止了吃桃子--并且愿意忍受可怕的戒断期--仅仅是因为内疚的痛苦已经变得难以承受。",
	"The first bold steps toward galactic empires wouldn't have been possible without remarkable advances in techno- magical theory and application. While, for eons, powerful wizards and sorcerers have been able to alter the fabric of reality, gods have had total reign of their own planes of existence, and demons, dragons, and all manner of eldritch creatures have leveraged their arcane might to bend worlds to their will, the common person has always had little to no contact with the arcane or the fantastical. In this age of automatons, interstellar empires, and pan- galactic communication, however, nearly everyone enjoys access to some form of enchantments, magics, or artifacts.": "如果没有技术--魔法理论和应用方面的显著进步，迈向星系帝国的第一个大胆步骤是不可能的。虽然长久以来，强大的魔法师和巫师能够改变现实的结构，神明能够完全控制他们自己的存在平面，恶魔、龙和各种长生生物能够利用他们的奥术力量使世界屈服于他们的意志，但普通人总是很少甚至没有接触到奥术或幻想。然而，在这个自动机、星际帝国和泛银河系通讯的时代，几乎每个人都能获得某种形式的魔法、魔术或文物。",
	"Low level magics have become nearly as commonplace across the 'verse as once were torches, pitchforks, and horses. While most people still can't banish a demon with the wave of their hand or rain fire down from the sky with a word, most have ready access to hardlight-projecting consoles, datapads which allow communication from one planet to another, healing apparatuses that work as well as any cleric, and other similar wondrous items. Magic, as far as the 'verse is concerned, is no longer at odds with technology: it has become technology.": "低级魔法在整个 \"诗篇 \"中几乎已经成为普遍现象，就像曾经的火把、干草叉和马匹一样。虽然大多数人仍然无法通过挥手驱逐恶魔，或者用一句话从天上降下火焰，但大多数人都可以随时使用硬光投影控制台，允许从一个星球到另一个星球进行通信的数据板，与任何牧师一样好用的治疗设备，以及其他类似的奇妙物品。就'诗篇'而言，魔法不再与技术相抵触：它已经成为技术。",
	"Modern magical technology traces its lineage back to traditional magic items, which possess incredible arcane potential and wondrous self-recharging properties—benefits which are tempered only by the fact that their construction demands months of work from a master artisan and centuries of arcane expertise to devise.

At first, these processes resulted only in half-baked imitations of magic items, but soon, the face of modern magical technology began to develop.": "现代魔法技术可以追溯到传统的魔法物品，它们拥有令人难以置信的奥术潜力和奇妙的自我充电特性--这些好处只是因为它们的建造需要工匠大师几个月的工作和几个世纪的奥术专业知识才能设计出来。随着银河系雷线的发现和后来的开发，魔法物品的建造变得工业化：一次性的、标准化的、廉价的。起初，这些工艺只产生了半生不熟的魔法物品的仿制品，但很快，现代魔法技术的面貌开始发展。",
	"A common element found across almost all arcane technology is arcane batteries—small, self-recharging power sources, whose energy can be adapted to nearly any application, from producing bursts of laser fire, to levitating objects, to creating holographic projections. Most of the time, the inner-workings of magical technology involves converting this power using a circuit of arcane components, such as abjurators, evocation shifters, illusiometers, somati-cyclers, and conjuration processors. The end result is a finely-tuned magical effect, exactly duplicating the efforts of a skilled spellcaster (with some limitations), but requiring almost no skill on behalf of the user. This new style of item creation is driven as much by mundane artisans, scientists, and entrepreneurs as it is by wizards or sorcerers, which is reflected in their designs.

Early ships often combined the principles and designs of ocean-sailing vessels, primitive gliders, and flying machines, and used levitation magic to achieve the desired effect. While these early ships couldn't perform the all-important void jump, they were fast enough to ferry their passengers between their homeworlds and nearby planets or moons, laying the groundwork for future expansion into the stars.": "尽管在发现暗物质引擎之前，它们被限制在相对较短的距离内，但'诗篇'中大多数著名的种族都有涉足近轨道或星际旅行的悠久历史。早期的飞船往往结合了远洋航行的船只、原始的滑翔机和飞行器的原理和设计，并使用浮空魔法来达到预期的效果。虽然这些早期的飞船不能进行至关重要的虚空跳跃，但它们的速度足以在它们的家园和附近的行星或卫星之间运送乘客，为未来向星际扩张奠定了基础。",
	"Somehow more pervasive than starships, {@filter blasters|items|Property=Blaster} are go-to weapons for most everyone in the 'verse.

Originally crafted in the profile of a hand crossbow without the limbs attached, the blaster quickly gained prominence as the premier weapon technology in the 'verse: simple to understand, easy to use, and remarkably deadly, with the added benefit of never needing to be reloaded.": "在某种程度上比星舰更普遍，{@filter blasters|items|Property=Blaster}是'诗篇'中大多数人的常用武器。最基本的是，爆破器是一种带有弧形电池和聚焦光圈的手持设备，当扣动扳机时，被设计成发射能量光束或 \"闪电\"。爆破器最初是按照手弩的外形制作的，没有连接肢体，很快就获得了突出的地位，成为诗篇中最重要的武器技术：简单易懂，易于使用，而且具有明显的杀伤力，还有一个额外的好处就是永远不需要重新装弹。",
	"Far from the short-range prototypes first pioneered by dwarven inventors, blasters today come in a dizzying array of shapes, styles, and functions, though there are clearly accepted favorites. Moreover, blaster technology has been adapted for ship use, allowing an enterprising captain to outfit their vessel with entire batteries of guns.": "与矮人发明家最初开创的短程原型相比，今天的爆破器有一系列令人眼花缭乱的形状、样式和功能，尽管有明显的公认的最爱。此外，爆破器技术已被改编为船舶使用，允许一个有进取心的船长为他们的船只配备整个枪支电池。",
	"While the old standards of bows, axes, and swords are still fairly widespread (especially on less advanced planets and among races, such as the Skathári, that favor traditional weapons), one would be hard-pressed to visit any settled world in the 'verse and not find someone brandishing a blaster. Adventurers might favor other, more eccentric weapons, such as the laser sword and rocket hammer, but they'd be mad not to have a magnus or repeater holstered at their side.": "虽然弓、斧和剑的旧标准仍然相当普遍（特别是在不太先进的星球和种族中，如Skathári，他们喜欢传统的武器），但人们很难在访问'诗篇'中的任何定居世界时不发现有人挥舞着爆破枪。冒险家们可能更喜欢其他更古怪的武器，如激光剑和火箭锤，但他们不把马格努斯或连发枪藏在身边就太疯狂了。",
	"The boundaries of the 'verse have always been pushed by intrepid galactic explorers and adventurers, a group which always seems to be in high demand and short supply. Despite the sheer number of worlds that have been mapped and colonized, there remains countless systems yet undiscovered and mysteries yet unsolved. Anyone that wishes to strike out into the 'verse and make a name for themselves need only have a ship, quick wits, and a boundless reservoir of daring.": "银河系的边界一直是由无畏的银河系探险家和冒险家推动的，这个群体似乎总是供不应求。尽管已经有大量的世界被测绘和殖民，但仍有无数的系统尚未被发现，仍有无数的谜团尚未解决。任何希望进入'se'并为自己扬名立万的人，只需要有一艘船、快速的智慧和无限的胆量。",
	"While much of the galaxy has been charted, cataloged, and colonized by one faction or another, there is by no means a comprehensive map of the 'verse. Unlike with terrestrial cartography, the features of the galaxy are always in flux; as such, there is exceptional money to be made in providing up-to-date star charts and void jump routes to the spacefaring community. The last thing a major shipping outfit needs is to deal with one of their cargo ships unexpectedly jumping into the middle of a Dead Magic Zone while carrying a load of adamantine ore or a shipment of priceless artifacts.": "虽然银河系的大部分地区已经被一个或另一个派别绘制了地图，编了目录，并被殖民了，但绝没有一张全面的'se'的地图。与陆地制图不同，银河系的特征总是在不断变化；因此，向航天界提供最新的星图和虚空跳跃路线，可以赚到很多钱。一个主要的航运公司最不愿意看到的是，他们的一艘货船在装载金刚砂矿石或无价文物时，意外地跳到了死亡魔区的中间。",
	"Similarly, planetary scans and surveys are an invaluable source of revenue for interstellar adventurers. The continuing expansion of the galactic community requires a constant stream of new materials, habitable worlds, outpost-worthy systems, and other resources. Scans of newly discovered worlds can prove invaluable, as being the first to discover a new world generally grants the discoverer right to claim ownership. Of course, while any discoverer can stake a claim over a planet, only huge factions can defend their claims, so most career scanners sell their data (and subsequent rights of territory) to larger organizations.": "同样，行星扫描和调查也是星际冒险家的一个宝贵的收入来源。银河系社会的持续扩张需要源源不断的新材料、可居住的世界、适合前哨的系统和其他资源。对新发现的世界的扫描可以被证明是非常有价值的，因为作为第一个发现一个新世界的人，通常会赋予发现者要求所有权的权利。当然，虽然任何发现者都可以对一个星球提出权利要求，但只有巨大的派别才能捍卫他们的权利要求，因此大多数职业扫描者将他们的数据（以及随后的领土权）卖给更大的组织。",
	"While perhaps less dangerous than surveying, making your career as a galactic cartographer or planet scanner is by no means leisurely or safe. Not counting the numerous astronomical hazards they must endure, a potential candidate must have a ship with an appropriately powerful Dark Matter engine and all the required mapping and scanning equipment, especially if they plan to chart the Frontier. To that end, most scanners end up signing on with one of the many cartography companies and firms scattered throughout the 'verse, who provide ships, man power, and equipment in exchange for a substantial cut of the discovery profits. Of these, the most expansive is Astrogations Inc.": "虽然可能没有测量那么危险，但作为银河系制图师或行星扫描仪的职业绝不是轻松或安全的。不算他们必须忍受的无数天文危险，一个潜在的候选人必须有一艘带有适当的强大的暗物质引擎和所有必要的绘图和扫描设备的飞船，特别是如果他们打算为边境地区绘图的话。为此，大多数扫描者最终与散布在整个'se'的许多制图公司和企业中的一家签约，他们提供船只、人力和设备，以换取发现利润的大量分成。在这些公司中，最广泛的是Astrogations公司。",
	"For adventurers with more modest budgets, scavenging can provide a lucrative, if unreliable, source of income and adventure. Due to the Black's utter stillness, a wrecked ship (and the potentially valuable components and cargo within) can remain pristine for hundreds of years without rusting or wearing away. Navigating the derelict wreck of a star cruiser destroyed in some long- forgotten battle can be a quick way to find a crate of valuable munitions, expensive blasters, or rare minerals; of course, it can also mean getting attacked by husks, eaten by a spaceshark, or captured by the wroth. Though scavenging doesn't require an expensive ship, the best loot is often in dangerous areas of the 'verse—places that demand a nimble ship or one with substantial firepower. Moreover, the means to haul heavy or dangerous cargo is a necessity, as worthy scrap is often only purchased by the ton and valuable cargo is often highly volatile.": "对于预算较少的冒险者来说，拾荒可以提供一个有利可图的收入和冒险来源，尽管不可靠。由于黑海的完全静止，一艘失事的船只（以及其中潜在的有价值的部件和货物）可以在数百年内保持原始状态而不生锈或磨损。在某个被遗忘已久的战斗中被摧毁的星际巡洋舰的废弃残骸中航行，可以快速找到一箱有价值的弹药、昂贵的爆破器或稀有的矿物；当然，这也意味着被沙尘攻击、被太空鲨吃掉或被邪恶的人抓走。虽然搜刮不需要昂贵的飞船，但最好的战利品往往是在'se'的危险区域--那些需要灵活的飞船或具有强大火力的地方。此外，运输重型或危险货物的方法也是必要的，因为有价值的废料往往只能按吨购买，而有价值的货物往往非常不稳定。",
	"Similarly, scavengers can mount terrestrial expeditions to newly discovered worlds or archaeological sites. Even in the era of galactic travel, the price of ancient and magical artifacts remains high, especially among collectors who value old-world designs. On almost any station in the 'verse, aspiring dungeon delvers can find jobs that require grit, know-how, and the ability to disarm and survive ancient deathtraps, in return for piles of treasure.": "同样地，拾荒者可以对新发现的世界或考古地点进行陆地探险。即使在银河系旅行的时代，古代和魔法文物的价格仍然很高，特别是在那些重视旧世界设计的收藏家中。在这个世界上的几乎任何一个站点，有抱负的地牢探险者都能找到需要勇气、技术和能力的工作，以解除古代的死亡陷阱并在其中生存，从而换取成堆的财宝。",
	"Most jobs of this nature tend to be funded through private collectors, who provide a general map of a given location, a basic stipend, and the promise of loot in return for the coveted bauble said to be located within. Most often, scavengers hired to retrieve artifacts are required to provide their own ship, arms, and necessary support, but in turn, the collector takes a smaller cut of the haul. The major exceptions to this rule are the Artifactor teams of Drog, Dusset, & Durgen Acquisitions & Trade, the largest and most well-funded relic traders in the 'verse: well-equipped and generously paid, Artifactors sign long contracts in exchange for their consistent retrievals and their unwavering loyalty to DD&D.": "大多数这种性质的工作都是通过私人收藏家资助的，他们提供一个特定地点的一般地图、基本的津贴，并承诺提供战利品以换取据说位于其中的令人垂涎的宝物。大多数情况下，被雇来取回文物的拾荒者需要提供自己的船只、武器和必要的支持，但反过来，收藏家也会从战利品中抽出一小部分。这条规则的主要例外是Drog、Dusset和Durgen Acquisitions & Trade的神器团队，他们是这个世界上最大、资金最充足的文物交易商：装备精良、报酬丰厚，神器们签署了长期合同，以换取他们持续的检索和对DD&D的坚定忠诚。",
	"For those who have no explicit desire for exploration or excavation, there is mercenary work, the time-honored tradition of shooting people and getting paid for it. Since the early days of rapid galactic expansion, the need for paid soldiers, body guards, thugs, and other forms of muscle has been a bloody constant. In the most war-torn areas of the 'verse, especially at the borders of the Warzone, there is always a place for a grizzled ex-soldier looking to ply their trade, a hungry warmage looking to prove themselves, or a skilled assassin eager to put a high- profile notch on their blade.": "对于那些没有明确的探索或挖掘欲望的人来说，还有雇佣兵的工作，这是一个历史悠久的传统，即开枪打人并获得报酬。自从银河系快速扩张的早期，对付费士兵、保镖、打手和其他形式的肌肉的需求一直是一个血腥的常态。在战争最激烈的地区，特别是在战区的边界，总是有一个地方需要一个灰头土脸的前士兵来从事他们的工作，一个饥饿的暖男想要证明自己，或者一个熟练的刺客渴望在他们的刀片上留下一个高调的缺口。",
	"Coupled with this is the near ubiquitous presence of bounty hunters. While the galaxy isn't without universal laws, most areas of jurisdiction are limited to specific regions of space. Sanctioned and licensed bounty hunters can bypass many of these restrictions, tracking criminals and wanted targets into neighboring systems, isolated planets, or even into the lawless Frontier.": "再加上赏金猎人几乎无处不在的存在。虽然银河系并不是没有普遍的法律，但大多数的管辖区域都被限制在特定的空间区域。经过批准和许可的赏金猎人可以绕过许多这些限制，追踪罪犯和被通缉的目标到邻近的系统、孤立的星球，甚至到无法无天的边境地区。",
	"Finding mercenary work is generally an easy feat for anyone that looks tough and can point a blaster in the right direction. However, securing a position with a well-known mercenary company can be much trickier, as the best companies only accept the smartest and toughest hired guns available. Gaining a position within such a unit requires a reputation of being loyal and highly skilled, and proving that track record over a number of jobs.": "对于任何一个看起来很强硬的人来说，找到雇佣兵工作通常是一件很容易的事，而且可以把爆破手指向正确的方向。然而，要在知名的雇佣兵公司获得一个职位可能要棘手得多，因为最好的公司只接受最聪明、最强悍的雇佣兵。要在这样的单位获得一个职位，需要有忠诚和高技能的声誉，并在一些工作中证明这一记录。",
	"Likewise, becoming a bounty hunter isn't terribly difficult, but the particulars of obtaining licenses can be daunting. Generally, working within a given jurisdiction requires bounty hunters to pass licensing exams, demonstrating that they understand the languages of the given area and the laws that govern it. This can be a difficult task, as laws and languages vary from planet to planet. Of course, a potential bounty hunter can simply choose to operate illegally and under the radar, but doing so runs afoul of both the law and more legitimate bounty hunters, sometimes ironically resulting in bounty hunters pursuing their illegal rivals.": "同样，成为一名赏金猎人并不十分困难，但获得许可证的具体细节可能令人生畏。一般来说，在一个特定的管辖区工作需要赏金猎人通过许可考试，以证明他们了解特定地区的语言和法律。这可能是一项艰巨的任务，因为不同星球的法律和语言各不相同。当然，潜在的赏金猎人可以简单地选择在雷达下非法运作，但这样做会触犯法律和更多合法的赏金猎人，有时会讽刺地导致赏金猎人追捕他们的非法对手。",
	"For most adventurers in the 'verse, spacing is a means to an end—a way to get from one job to the next. For dedicated spacers who make their living flying between the stars, the ship is both the means and the end. In even greater demand than hired muscle, shipping crews form the backbone of galactic society, ferrying goods, people, and services of all sorts between ports of call across the 'verse.": "对于大多数冒险者来说，空间是达到目的的一种手段--从一个工作到下一个工作的方式。对于那些以在星际间飞行为生的专职太空人来说，飞船既是手段也是目的。船员的需求甚至比雇佣兵还要大，他们构成了银河系社会的骨干，在整个宇宙的各个港口之间运送货物、人员和各种服务。",
	"Even short journeys through the Black require a competent crew to man the ship: captains, pilots, astrogators, gunners, defense personnel, medics, cooks, engineers, and many other roles are necessary to bring the largest ships to life. Adventurers of almost any background and skill-set can find a position working on a ship, even for one-time jobs. Such positions might not pay as well as other jobs, but they are discreet and dependable.": "即使是短暂的黑夜之旅，也需要一个有能力的船员来管理船只：船长、飞行员、星际探险家、炮手、防卫人员、医务人员、厨师、工程师和许多其他角色都是必要的，以使最大的船只成为生命。几乎任何背景和技能的冒险者都能找到在船上工作的职位，甚至是一次性的工作。这样的职位可能没有其他工作的报酬高，但他们是谨慎和可靠的。",
	"Regardless of their actual occupation, most adventurers spend as much time aboard a ship as a dedicated spacer. In fact, the downtime of more exciting jobs, such as military service, body-guarding, and exploration is practically identical to generic spacing work, so many recruits are expected to have some prerequisite experience on a shipping or trading vessel. It is on these all-purpose spacing jobs where most intrepid adventurers have their first run-ins with the myriad dangers of the 'verse, where they cut their teeth on heroism, and where they hone their skills.": "无论他们的实际职业如何，大多数冒险者在船上花费的时间与专门的太空人一样多。事实上，更刺激的工作，如军事服务、保镖和探索，其停工时间几乎与一般的间隔工作相同，所以许多新兵被期望在航运或贸易船上有一些先决条件的经验。正是在这些通用的间隔工作中，大多数无畏的冒险者第一次接触到了'se'的无数危险，他们在这里切磋英雄主义，并在这里磨练他们的技能。",
	"Many humanoid races can be found on isolated worlds throughout the galaxy, which themselves look like a microcosm of the galactic community, with elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, and others sharing a single planet. Of course, it would be absurd for so many diverse races to develop on the same world; all these humanoids can trace their origins to different systems among the stars. In some cases, seeding new worlds with humanoids is a deliberate experiment or colonization effort, but most often, isolated populations of humanoids are the result of miscalculations in navigation or mistakes of teleportation magic.": "在整个银河系的孤立世界上可以找到许多人形种族，这些世界本身就像银河系社会的一个缩影，精灵、矮人、人类、半身人和其他人共享一个星球。当然，这么多不同的种族在同一个世界上发展是很荒谬的；所有这些人形生物都可以追溯到他们在恒星中的不同系统的起源。在某些情况下，用人形生物播种新的世界是一种故意的实验或殖民努力，但大多数情况下，孤立的人形生物种群是导航中的误判或传送魔法的错误造成的。",
	"Amorphous, bizarre, and remarkably advanced, {@race amoeboid|darkmatter|amoeboids} are the very definition of alien. Encountering them is practically dizzying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague forms and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum of blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.": "无定形的、怪异的、非常先进的，（%0%）是外星人的定义。遇到它们，对于第一次来到大嘴的游客来说，几乎是头晕目眩：它们阴森透明的身体闪烁着昏暗的有机光，变形为模糊的形式和各种生物的不完美拷贝，所有这些都伴随着模糊和音调的奇怪哼唱。虽然宇宙擅长生产各种形状和大小的生物，但变形虫是真正独特的东西。",
	"Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cutting- edge intersection of science and arcana.": "此外，变形金刚具有超凡的智慧，许多人拥有使用机器的天赋。他们是第一批进入太空的种族之一（如果考虑到他们的起源，则是第一批），并且仍然是暗物质技术的先驱。大多数变形金刚对科学推理抱有极大的信心，以至于一个健全的统计模型往往比报告的事件更有说服力。当然，这也延伸到了魔法研究中，阿米巴人的技术处于科学和奥术的尖端交汇处。",
	"Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply discovered on the maws. Some speculate that the amoeboids evolved there among the advanced technology, but just as many support the theory that amoeboids were designed and purposefully placed on the maws.": "如此独特的人形生物应该来自同样独特的家园，但事实并非如此；amoeboids只是在大颚上被发现。一些人推测，变形金刚是在那里的先进技术中演化出来的，但同样有很多人支持变形金刚是被设计出来的，并被有目的地放置在大颚上的理论。",
	"The universe has no shortage of mysteries and enigmas, but scholars have long agreed that the origin of the maws, and how the amoeboids came to inhabit them, is the Grand Mystery. After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.": "宇宙中不乏神秘和谜团，但学者们早就同意，大口怪的起源，以及变形金刚是如何居住在其中的，才是大谜团。毕竟，如此神奇的事情不可能仅仅是巧合；巨口是一个现成的交通网络，连接着银河系的远方，并有一个足够聪明的变形金刚种族来理解它们，并有足够的技能来维护它们。事实上，如果没有亲身观察过巨口站，大多数种族可能永远不会发现暗物质技术。每个技术发现都是建立在巨人的肩膀上，但在这种情况下，巨人却神秘地消失了。",
	"More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it's unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?": "更令人困惑的是，这些巨口在本质上不仅仅是技术性的；它们是在早已死亡的生物的巨大骨架上建造的。骨头本身似乎至关重要，因为没有它们就不可能创造出一个稳定的巨口，但它们所扮演的角色却让研究人员完全摸不着头脑。此外，目前还不清楚是什么类型的生物留下了这些骨头，因为今天没有任何活着的东西与它们有丝毫相似。这些生物是否已经灭绝，或者只是还没有被发现？它们是否来自银河系内部，或者甚至来自我们的宇宙内部？",
	"For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids, learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed \"zero\" generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.": "就他们而言，变形金刚对大奥秘几乎没有答案；他们的起源对他们来说和其他人一样难以捉摸。最早的变形虫记录可以追溯到变形虫的第一个实例，它们学会了如何与巨嘴终端连接并记录数据，也许是在所谓的 \"零 \"世代之后的一个世纪。在这之前是一个短暂但无法穿透的黑暗时代，一直延伸到巨口的激活，掩盖了它们的起源。",
	"It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation.": "从科学的参照系中寻找答案是他们的天性，但真正的证据到目前为止还很难找到。人们猜测 \"老云 \"参与了这个谜团，但他扮演了什么角色还不清楚。也许这个大谜团被一个或多个强大的创造者故意掩盖了，也许所有参与其中的人都缺少一些关键的部分，一些将变形金刚、大嘴和他们神秘的创造联系起来的洞察力。",
	"Before most races mastered spaceflight and journeyed to the stars, the only records of amoeboids were of bug-eyed visitors from another world, arriving by night in strange saucers to abduct livestock and flash otherworldly lights. Amoeboids were among the first to travel the stars (their ships derived from technology found on the maws), and they did so with purely scientific intentions: every alien planet, star, nebula, and creature they discover is studied, categorized, and detailed in a vast database of arcane terminals called the {@b Compendium}. This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.": "在大多数种族掌握了航天技术并前往恒星之前，关于阿莫博伊德的唯一记录是来自另一个世界的虫眼访客，他们乘着奇怪的飞碟在夜间抵达，绑架牲畜并闪耀着异世界的光芒。Amoeboids是第一批在星际旅行的人（他们的飞船来自于在Maws上发现的技术），他们这样做是出于纯粹的科学目的：他们发现的每一个外星行星、恒星、星云和生物都被研究、分类，并在一个被称为{@b Compendium}的庞大的神秘终端数据库中详细说明。这个单一的数据库，收集了几乎所有他们知道的东西，是一个科学奇迹，是所有阿米巴人成就的纪念碑。",
	"To this day, amoeboids are the only race that maintains a non-involvement policy in their visits to other worlds, keeping their distance, observing remotely when possible, and experimenting only when disturbance can be minimized. The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community.": "时至今日，amoeboids是唯一一个在访问其他世界时保持不参与政策的种族，他们保持距离，在可能的情况下进行远程观察，并且只在干扰可以最小化的情况下进行实验。不参与的唯一例外是那些已经前往大嘴的太空种族；阿墨博伊人以平等的身份迎接这些群体，并欢迎他们进入银河系社区。",
	"The bird-headed {@race avia-ra|darkmatter} might almost be confused for humans from the neck down, but unlike the scores of near- humans that pervade the galaxy, the avia-ra are unrelated to humanity. Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun's blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal.": "鸟头人（%0%）从脖子往下看几乎可以和人类混淆，但与弥漫在银河系的数十种近似人类不同，阿维亚拉人与人类没有关系。他们来自凯美特，一个严酷的沙漠星球，河流和湖泊纵横交错，他们一直知道对太阳的祝福和残酷的欣赏，这构成了他们宗教的支柱，激发了他们的艺术和科学，并影响了他们对宇宙的看法。他们的教条完全围绕着他们的神灵和圣洁的星星--天上的太阳，没有人可以与之相提并论。",
	"When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical \"true star\" from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.": "然而，当阿维亚人迈出他们进入太空飞行的第一步时，他们的宗教就开始弯曲并适应他们发现自己所处的更广阔的宇宙。突然间，他们的太阳不再是Deshret，即他们的家园所围绕的那颗星，而是一颗理论上的 \"真星\"，所有的星星，包括他们自己的星星，都从这里获得了意义。几个世纪后，他们才冒险来到银河系的中心，遇到了他们认为是 \"太阳之上 \"的实际体现的东西：墓穴星。",
	"In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.": "在那些日子里，海王星的轨道离银河系核心的黑洞更远，而且它肯定是在精灵的控制之下。avia-ra很快就从精灵那里了解到，海王星不仅仅是一颗恒星，而是包含了某种超大质量的结构。尽管对精灵来说，这只是一个学术上的好奇，但这一发现激励了阿维亚人：在这颗恒星的中心，靠近银河系的确切中心，是他们的太阳。在接下来的几个世纪里，avia-ra悄悄地加强和聚集他们的舰队，为第一次十字军东征做准备。",
	"This was the first of many Crusades, bloody battles between the avia-ra and the elves for control of the center of the galaxy. Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star—a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression. In short order, it was seized by an elven sneak attack; ever since, the Citadel has become a flashpoint for conflict and a central focus for Crusades.": "这是许多次十字军东征中的第一次，是阿维亚拉人和精灵之间为控制银河系中心而进行的血腥战斗。每一次十字军东征都以签署条约为标志，从战斗中得到喘息，并巩固力量。总是，双方中的一方的突然袭击重新点燃了冲突。在第三次十字军东征中，阿维亚人在墓穴星周围的轨道上建造了巨大的太阳城，这是一座圣城，为了太阳的荣耀和阻止精灵的侵略而建造。很快，它就被精灵的偷袭所占领；从那时起，太阳城就成了冲突的爆发点和十字军东征的中心。",
	"The most recent of these battles, called the {@b Night Crusade}, nearly saw the wholesale destruction of the Elven Empire. The holy avia-ra fleet, known as the Congregation, captured the center of the galaxy in a series of decisive victories and pushed the elves back to their home system. In this moment, the balance of the galaxy was threatened, and the elves struck a bargain: in exchange for their assistance, the elves would liberate the vect across their empire—a move which would eventually pave the way for vect freedom across the 'verse.": "这些战役中最近的一次，被称为{@b Night Crusade}，几乎看到了精灵帝国的全盘毁灭。被称为 \"圣会 \"的神圣的avia-ra舰队在一系列决定性的胜利中占领了银河系的中心，并将精灵们赶回了他们的母星系。在这一时刻，银河系的平衡受到了威胁，精灵们达成了一个交易：作为对他们援助的交换，精灵们将解放整个帝国的vect--此举最终将为整个'诗篇'的vect自由铺平道路。",
	"The culmination of this deal was at the Battle of Alden'val, where the vect fleet turned the tide for the elves, critically wounding the avia-ra's flagship, The Prophet. The ensuing retreat made an opening for the Elven Forest-Fleet, which encircled the Congregation, spelling the end of the Crusade. The war ended with the signing of the {@b Treaty Black}, a document that quieted hostilities and established the {@b Order of the Sepulcher} to safeguard against similar crises in the future.": "这笔交易的高潮是在阿尔登谷战役中，维克特舰队为精灵们扭转了局势，重创了阿维亚拉的旗舰 \"先知 \"号。随后的撤退为精灵族的森林舰队打开了一个缺口，它包围了圣会，意味着十字军的结束。战争以签署{@b Treaty Black}而结束，这份文件平息了敌对行动，并建立了{@b Order of the Sepulcher}，以防止未来发生类似的危机。",
	"To some, the avia-ra's captivating dogma, high priesthood, and Congregation warfleet represent a light and peace in the 'verse, but to others, it represents a simmering kettle, just waiting to boil over.": "对一些人来说，阿维亚拉迷人的教条、高高在上的神职人员和圣会战队代表着 \"诗篇 \"中的光明与和平，但对其他人来说，它代表着一个沸腾的水壶，正等待着沸腾。",
	"In the past, the avia-ra have found little success spreading the message of the Sun Above to the established races of the 'verse. After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.": "过去，avia-ra发现向 \"诗篇 \"的既定种族传播 \"太阳之上 \"的信息并不成功。毕竟，他们的万神殿非常广泛，是他们社会的组成部分；一神教的神在他们中没有什么地位。相反，阿维亚人转向了原始文明，特别是那些未被发现的星球上的文明，与之分享他们的信息。",
	"The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.": "他们传教的模式很简单：在一个不发达的世界上建立一个文明，以他们的太阳宗教哲学为基础，在那里居住足够长的时间，以确保它留下持久的遗产，然后再一次离开，前往星空。在阿维亚拉宗教中，所有对太阳的崇拜都是对太阳神的间接崇拜，所以他们的光和火焰之神随着几个世纪的流逝而发生的任何演变都是无足轻重的；他们仍然是墓穴星中老吽的遗像。",
	"This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing—High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war. Thus, avia-ra evangelism occupies an uncomfortable, but tolerated position in the galaxy.": "至少可以说，这种做法是有争议的。许多世界都有来自其他世界的旅行者的古老故事，他们带来了太阳的祝福，而这些描述把他们描绘得很像神本身。尤其是人类，对这种不公平的传教行为很反感--高泰拉是阿维亚-拉传教士的早期目标。精灵和矮人认为他们自己的万神殿是神圣的，并从整体上谴责阿维亚拉传教士，但银河系社区几乎无能为力，除非煽动银河系战争。因此，阿维亚-拉的传教在银河系中占据了一个令人不舒服的位置，但却被容忍。",
	"Gruff, inventive, and stalwart, the dwarves of the 'verse are nearly identical to those living planetside. Despite spending most of their time in massive fleets of mining and war ships, star dwarves are just as comfortable in the bowels of a mountain as their terrestrial brethren. Indeed, the dwarves who make up the Galactic Dwarven Conclave know that the biggest and richest mountains to be mined are, in fact, asteroids drifting aimlessly through the Black.": "星际矮人粗犷、富有创造力、坚韧不拔，与生活在行星上的矮人几乎完全一样。尽管他们大部分时间都在庞大的采矿和战争船队中度过，但星际矮人在山腹中也和他们的陆地兄弟一样舒适。事实上，组成银河系矮人协约国的矮人知道，可以开采的最大和最丰富的山峰，实际上是漫无目的地在黑海中漂流的小行星。",
	"While terrestrial dwarves deviate into distinct branches based on familial lines, star dwarves, especially those from their homeworld of Jormund, take on traits which make them sturdier than their terrestrial brethren. The high gravity of their homeworld strengthens their bones and ensures their short, stocky stature, and a life spent doing industrial labor toughens their muscles into steel.": "虽然陆地上的矮人根据家族血统分成了不同的分支，但星际矮人，尤其是那些来自乔蒙德家园的矮人，所具有的特征使他们比陆地上的兄弟们更结实。他们家园的高重力强化了他们的骨骼，确保了他们短小精悍的身材，而从事工业劳动的生活则将他们的肌肉锻炼成钢铁。",
	"Dwarven expansion into space took a somewhat different route than most, in that there was little in the way of war or conquest. Ages before they discovered spaceflight, the dwarves had already founded the beginnings of the Conclave, which drove the interests of their entire race forward under one banner. When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy. To this day, no other interstellar race can match the raw material wealth or manufacturing skill of the dwarves, a fact which the Conclave would like to ensure.": "矮人向太空的扩张采取了与大多数人不同的路线，因为几乎没有战争或征服的方式。在他们发现太空飞行的年代之前，矮人已经建立了协约国的雏形，在一个旗帜下推动整个种族的利益。当他们开始向整个银河系扩张时，他们发现，尽管乔蒙是各种生命的宿主，但周围的系统却很贫瘠。然而，他们在居民方面的不足，在矿产资源方面得到了弥补。根据他们的本性，矮人将他们的技能、魔法和技术转向这些星球的开采，并将涌入的物质转化为银河系中最大的采矿和货运舰队。时至今日，没有任何一个星际种族能与矮人的原材料财富或制造技术相提并论，这也是协约国想要确保的事实。",
	"From the outside, Jormund, the second of three planets orbiting the star Jotun, seems like the least likely place to find a thriving race of people: it is a desolate ball of rock, pockmarked with craters, nearly devoid of atmosphere, and constantly blasted by radiation. Just below this stark surface, though, Jormund teems with life, not the least of which are the dwarves themselves.": "从外面看，乔蒙德是围绕约顿星运行的三颗行星中的第二颗，似乎是最不可能找到一个繁荣的种族的地方：它是一个荒凉的岩石球，布满了陨石坑，几乎没有大气层，而且经常受到辐射的冲击。然而，就在这严峻的表面之下，约顿星充满了生命，其中最重要的是矮人本身。",
	"The oldest dwarven records recall that Jormund once flourished with surface life. Eons ago, long before the dwarves fashioned their first ships from mountains and rockets, a great cataclysm befell the planet, forcing life on the planet to flee underground. The details of the old cataclysm are lost to time, for conflicting stories tell of different disasters, from a war caused by the greed of an ancient dwarven king, to the folly of an invention crafted by a mad blacksmith, to the poisonous breath of a spiteful dragon which contaminated the skies.": "最古老的矮人记录显示，乔蒙德曾经盛产地表生物。很久以前，在矮人用山和火箭制造出他们的第一艘船之前，一场巨大的灾难降临在这个星球上，迫使这个星球上的生命逃往地下。这场大灾难的细节已被时间湮没，因为相互矛盾的故事讲述了不同的灾难，从一个古老的矮人国王的贪婪引起的战争，到一个疯狂的铁匠的愚蠢的发明，再到一条有毒的龙的呼吸污染了天空。",
	"Despite being sequestered away under the surface, the subterranean dwarven cities are true marvels of engineering. Their tunnels stretch deep into the planet,  some reaching nearly to its core. The highest cities, which reach the surface itself are full of brisk winds and titanic granite stonework, while the lowest cities, nestled in artificially-cooled pockets within molten rock, are humid places of stunning obsidian towers. Indeed, within its rocky caverns and carved halls, the planet's interior, called the {@b Granite Throne}, can house nearly every inhabitant of dwarven space. This becomes a requirement at least once a generation, as each dwarf dedicated to the Conclave makes the journey home to elect two of their elders to supreme leadership, that of the Matriarch and the Patriarch.": "尽管被封存在地表之下，地下的矮人城市是真正的工程奇迹。他们的隧道延伸到了地球深处，有些几乎到达了地球的核心。最高的城市达到了地表本身，充满了凛冽的风和巨大的花岗岩石雕，而最低的城市，依偎在熔岩中人工冷却的口袋里，是潮湿的地方，有着令人惊叹的黑曜石塔。事实上，在它的岩石洞穴和雕刻的大厅里，这个星球的内部，被称为（%0%），几乎可以容纳矮人空间的所有居民。这成为每一代人至少一次的要求，因为每个致力于协约国的矮人都要回家，选举他们的两位长者担任最高领导，即母系长老和父系长老。",
	"Despite their peaceful expansion to the stars, dwarves retain every ounce of their legendary ruggedness, their love of strong drink, and their fury in battle. Dwarven soldiers and smiths are held in high regard across the 'verse as potential mercenaries or crew members⁠—many even think having a dwarf aboard is good luck. Dwarven spacecraft are praised just as highly: the Adamantine Fleet may not be as large as the Hegemony Armada nor as swift as an Elven Forest-Fleet, but its ships are nearly impossible to destroy. Coupled with the dwarven tendency to experiment with explosives, even a single dwarven ship can make for an astonishingly frightening foe.": "尽管他们和平地扩展到了星际，但矮人仍然保留了他们传说中的粗犷，他们对烈酒的喜爱，以及他们在战斗中的狂暴。矮人士兵和铁匠作为潜在的雇佣兵或船员在整个 \"诗篇 \"中受到高度重视--许多人甚至认为有一个矮人在船上是好运气。矮人的航天器也同样受到高度赞扬：亚当丁舰队可能不像霸权舰队那样庞大，也不像精灵森林舰队那样迅速，但它的船只几乎不可能被摧毁。再加上矮人对爆炸物的实验倾向，即使是一艘矮人飞船也能成为令人惊异的可怕敌人。",

	"Among the oldest and longest-lived races in the 'verse, elves were the first to harness their magical skill to extend their reach to the stars above. Svelte, stately, and regal to a fault, elves often view themselves as the true masters of the galaxy, a perspective which has sparked innumerable conflicts in ages past. While they are not physically much different from terrestrial elves (save for their tremendously long lifespans), elves of the 'verse are often referred to as \"Star Elves\" due to their wildly different outlook and their connection to the great stellar houses.": "在这个世界上最古老和最长寿的种族中，精灵是第一个利用他们的魔法技能将他们的触角延伸到星空的种族。精灵们身材苗条，体态端庄，有一种高贵的气质，他们常常把自己看作是银河系的真正主人，这种观点在过去的年代里引发了无数的冲突。虽然他们在身体上与陆地上的精灵没有什么不同（除了他们巨大的寿命），但由于他们狂野的前景和与伟大的恒星屋的联系，'诗篇'中的精灵经常被称为 \"星际精灵\"。",
	"Unlike the elven races of more isolated worlds, star elves are not split down genetic or racial lines; rather, they have deliberately self-separated into fantastically prominent Great Houses, or families, each of which claims sole residence of one of the planets in the elven home system. These separate families modify themselves to assume the traits of traditional elven subraces. In this way, even though star elves long ago homogenized to a single appearance, every variation of elf can still be found among their ranks. Their austere focus on house and family, while unifying, has also led to notoriously strict traditions regarding naming, relationships, and procreation.": "与更多孤立世界的精灵种族不同，星际精灵并没有按照基因或种族的界限进行分裂；相反，他们故意自我分离成奇特的大屋，或家族，每个家族都声称独自居住在精灵母星系统中的一个星球。这些独立的家族对自己进行了改造，使其具有传统精灵亚族的特征。这样一来，尽管星际精灵早已同质化为单一的外观，但在他们的队伍中仍然可以找到各种不同的精灵。他们对房屋和家庭的严苛关注，在统一的同时，也导致了在命名、关系和生育方面众所周知的严格传统。",
	"Of all the major galactic alliances, the Elven Empire holds the largest territory. Hundreds of life-bearing systems and thousands of planets live under their rule, each a mirror of the glory that is the homeworld.

	"To those that cross into elven space, adherence to the law of the throne is paramount. While the Elves of Etilion are celebrated as masterful negotiators and diplomats, they are also decried for their iron-fisted rule and brutal censorship. The last thing any free spacer wishes on an enemy is a trip to an elven prison colony.": "对于那些进入精灵空间的人来说，遵守王室的法律是最重要的。虽然伊蒂利安的精灵被誉为高超的谈判者和外交家，但他们也因其铁腕统治和残酷的审查制度而受到谴责。任何自由空间人都不希望自己的敌人被送进精灵族的监狱殖民地。",
	"In a surprising turn, vect are allowed both complete autonomy and full citizenship on any world in the empire, a lingering gesture of thanks for their support during the Night Crusade. It is not a gift most vect take up fully, but it has generated much goodwill between the races since the war.": "在一个令人惊讶的转折中，vect被允许在帝国的任何一个世界上拥有完全的自治权和完全的公民权，这是为了感谢他们在夜幕十字军东征中的支持而做出的一个挥之不去的姿态。这不是一个大多数维科特人完全接受的礼物，但自战争以来，它在种族之间产生了许多善意。",
	"All elves of the empire proper are born or reared on Uneara, second planet in the Etilion system.

	"By tradition, the Rite of Naming also adapts elves for their house by means of a series of powerful transmutation spells.

	"Lastly, those who exhibit a talent for subterfuge, stealth, and shadow magics are named to Great House Miri'tesh, and given home on Siink, the ninth and furthest planet from the Etilion sun. The Rite of Naming induces incredible changes in elves of House Miri'tesh, pigmenting their skin to blue, purple, or shades of grey, and bleaching their hair to ivory white. Outside elven space, most refer to them as Drow, though that name carries no meaning in the empire. The dark elves of Miri'tesh serve as the empire's spymasters, assassins, and shock troopers, as well as deep space exploration and tracking experts.": "最后，那些在潜伏、隐身和影子魔法方面表现出天赋的人被命名为伟大的Miri'tesh家族，并在Siink--离Etilion太阳第九个也是最远的星球上被赋予了家园。命名仪式会使米里泰什家族的精灵发生不可思议的变化，他们的皮肤会被染成蓝色、紫色或灰色，头发会被漂白成象牙白色。在精灵空间之外，大多数人称他们为鸦人，尽管这个名字在帝国里没有任何意义。米里泰什的黑暗精灵是帝国的间谍专家、刺客和突击队员，同时也是深空探索和追踪专家。",
	"Despite the total commitment expected of each and every elf to the Empire and their house, there are those who choose to break from their familial lines and never undergo the Rite of Naming.

	"Due to the strictness of the House system, breeding amongst the elves is a highly controlled affair. New elves may only be conceived and born on appropriate worlds in elven space, and must be transported within 10 years of their birth to Uneara for schooling and assessment, lest they be cast out. Children born outside these confines are either torn from their families and consigned as Houseless or are purged from the empire; the same is true of half-elves and planetouched born in elven space. Those isolated elves who are found native to a colonized elven world are sorted and sent to their respective new homes for a minimum of 50 years before being integrated into star elf society, or are purged if they refuse.": "由于家族制度的严格性，精灵们的繁殖是一件高度受控的事情。新的精灵只能在精灵空间的适当世界中受孕和出生，并且必须在出生后10年内被送到乌尼拉接受教育和评估，否则他们就会被赶出去。在这些范围之外出生的孩子，要么被从他们的家庭中剥离出来，被当作无家可归者，要么被清除出帝国；在精灵空间出生的半精灵和行星人也是如此。那些被发现原产于被殖民的精灵世界的孤立的精灵会被分类，并在融入星际精灵社会之前被送到他们各自的新家，至少50年，如果他们拒绝的话，就会被清除掉。",

	"While by no means a new race, the gnomes of Nebellion are one of the younger starfaring races. As their world is isolated within a Dead Magic Zone, the gnomes came to rely on their own ingenuity, instead of magical tricks, to cultivate their world. With time, gnomes developed an adept discipline founded on logical reasoning and manipulating nonmagical forces, which they call science. This science is the foundation of all gnomish technology, which is wholly independent from magic and can function without hindrance in Dead Magic Zones.": "内贝里的地精虽然不是一个新的种族，但却是一个年轻的星际种族。由于他们的世界被隔离在一个死亡魔法区，地精开始依靠自己的智慧，而不是魔法技巧，来培育他们的世界。随着时间的推移，地精们发展了一门建立在逻辑推理和操纵非魔法力量基础上的熟练学科，他们称之为科学。这门科学是所有地精技术的基础，它完全独立于魔法，可以在死亡魔法区毫无阻碍地运行。",
	"Naturally drawn to the underground, the gnomes transformed the caves and mountains of Nebellion into grand, glittering cities, packed with mechanical marvels of every variety. Eventually, the great spires of the under- cities burst forth from the ground, and continued to grow like blades of grass wrought from steel and glass; now, there is little of Nebellion's surface that isn't covered by cityscape. While Nebellion's environment hasn't suffered with the gnome's expansion (freedom from reliance on burnable fuels being an early accomplishment of gnome tinkers), living space has become a premium. It was a search for this resource that led to their expansion into the stars.": "地精自然而然地被吸引到地下，他们把内贝里的洞穴和山脉变成了宏伟的、闪闪发光的城市，挤满了各种机械的奇迹。最终，地下城市的巨大尖顶从地下迸发出来，并像钢铁和玻璃锻造的草叶一样继续生长；现在，内贝利恩的表面几乎没有不被城市景观覆盖的地方。虽然内贝里的环境并没有因为地精的扩张而受到影响（摆脱对可燃燃料的依赖是地精工匠的一项早期成就），但生活空间已经变得很重要。正是对这种资源的寻找，导致了他们向星空的扩张。",
	"Remarkably, nearly two decades before the gnomes first launched into space, they discovered that they had not been the first intelligent life on their homeworld. Embedded deep below the surface of Nebellion, gnomish explorers discovered what appeared to be a city-sized disc made of unknown metals, filled not with scientific marvels, but nonfunctional arcane devices. They also discovered the burnt-out remnants of a Dark Matter engine, and from there proceeded to reverse-engineer their way into the stars. Despite the fact that most of the enchanted objects (including those which seem to be recordings or record keepers) located on the vessel were intact, years of testing yielded no results; no form of gnomish power could cause them to spring to life, and even re-introduction to magic outside the Dead Magic Zone proved fruitless. To this day, it remains a mystery as to who landed on Nebellion, how long ago they landed, and how they traversed the Zone with such a vessel.": "值得注意的是，在地精首次进入太空的近二十年前，他们发现自己并不是他们家园的第一个智慧生命。地精探险家们在内贝里恩地表下的深处，发现了一个似乎是由未知金属制成的城市大小的圆盘，里面装的不是科学奇迹，而是无法使用的神秘装置。他们还发现了被烧毁的暗物质引擎的残余物，并从那里开始逆向设计他们进入星际的方式。尽管位于船上的大多数魔法物品（包括那些似乎是录音或记录器的物品）都完好无损，但多年的测试却没有任何结果；没有任何形式的地精力量可以使它们复活，甚至在死亡魔法区之外重新引入魔法也被证明没有结果。时至今日，谁在内贝里恩登陆，他们在多长时间前登陆，以及他们如何用这样的船只穿越该区，仍然是个谜。",
	"What isn't a mystery is the effect the disc's discovery had on gnomish society. Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the 'verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years' time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it.": "并不神秘的是圆盘的发现对地精社会的影响。在15年内，穿越者协会成功地制造出了一个由他们已知的燃料来源驱动的正常运转的低级暗物质引擎。五年后，他们完善了新技术并实现了太空飞行。五十年内，地精们突破了 \"区 \"的边缘，到达了离内贝里昂最近的大嘴，并发现了自己在 \"区 \"中的地位。整个地精社会重新集中精力，又过了50年，伟大的地精船队开始从内贝里的造船厂出发，带着75%的人口。",
	"The Gnomish Flotilla is almost a million ships strong and houses almost half a trillion inhabitants. Due to small gnomish stature, this suits most of the Flotilla's inhabitants just fine. Indeed, despite their massive numbers, the Flotilla could support a population twice its current size. The gnomes live in an essentially post- scarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship's engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.": "地精船队有近一百万艘船，容纳了近五万亿居民。由于地精的身材矮小，这对船队的大多数居民来说都很合适。事实上，尽管他们人数众多，但船队可以支持其目前规模两倍的人口。地精们生活在一个本质上是后匮乏的社会，大多数人将他们的时间和精力投入到发明、探索、艺术努力或学习中。令人惊讶的是，无论是船队还是内贝里恩的真正的冒险家都很少，因为地精倾向于规避风险，如果他们有能力的话。不过，星际地精作为飞船的工程师、飞行员和技术专家还是非常受欢迎的，他们的技术因为能够在死亡魔区完美运行而受到高度评价。",
	"The governing body of the star gnomes is split between the Council of Six on Nebellion and the Admiralty of the Flotilla. The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet's year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman's Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason's Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker's Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan's Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla's current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.": "星际地精的管理机构分为内贝里恩的六人理事会和船队的海军司令部。六人理事会作为一个民主选举的理事会，由六个行会的成员组成，这六个行会几个世纪以来一直管理着这个星球的年复一年的工作。工匠公会（机械和技术工程），石匠公会（大型建筑工程），面包师公会（农业和可持续发展工程），穿越公会（探索和扩张项目），风车公会（电力效率和发电项目），以及工匠公会（文化项目和艺术品）。相反，海军部由船队的现任海军司令和他的下属军官管理。船队中的每艘船就像一个独立的国家：可以根据自己的需要自由行动，但仍然需要在被召唤时向海军上将报告。",
	"While not fully granted citizenship in either the Flotilla or on the Homeworld, most terrestrial gnomes are viewed as star-crossed brethren by the star gnomes. Their natural inclination towards spellcasting (particularly illusion magic) causes some star gnomes to view them with a modicum of suspicion, but most realize that they too would have gravitated towards such pursuits had their world been accommodating.": "虽然在船队和家园中都没有完全获得公民权，但大多数陆地地精都被星际地精视为星际兄弟。他们对法术（尤其是幻术）的自然倾向使一些星际地精对他们产生了一定程度的怀疑，但大多数人意识到，如果他们的世界能够包容，他们也会倾向于这种追求。",
	"It took thousands of years of magical study and refinement to develop the Dark Matter engine, and they have the gall to learn how to jump without one?!": "花了几千年的魔法研究和完善，才开发出黑暗物质引擎，而他们竟然敢在没有一个人的情况下学习如何跳楼？",

	"Ask any road traveler what to expect when visiting a halfling town, and they'll usually say the same thing: soft beds (maybe on the small side), strong ale, hearty food, heartwarming song, and rousing dance; ask any spacer the same question about docking in a halfling Hearthstation, and you'll hear much the same thing, with a bit added on about potentially unfair species taxes and grumbling about the going rate or parts in the repair shop.": "问任何一个路过的旅行者在访问半身人城镇时应该期待什么，他们通常会说同样的话：柔软的床（也许偏小）、浓烈的麦酒、丰盛的食物、温暖的歌声和激昂的舞蹈；问任何一个太空人关于停靠在半身人炉灶站的同样问题，你会听到同样的话，再加上一点关于潜在的不公平物种税和对维修店的价格或零件的抱怨。",
	"Much like the dwarves, the halflings of Hearthmund made their leap to the stars without major conflict; but unlike the dwarves, they didn't do so of their own accord. Given that halflings in general live long lives and hold personal freedom and community above most other things, there was little rush for those of Hearthmund to escape their idyllic world. Until a dwarven vessel in dire need of repair crash landed on their world nearly three millennia ago, the halflings neither knew, nor presumably cared, that there were other intelligent life forms in the galaxy. The discovery of life outside Hearthmund, though, sparked something of a great wanderlust in the little folk: many eagerly followed the dwarves back out into space to properly meet the other members of the galaxy. Those wandering halflings learned all about the inner workings of spaceflight, the maws, the stars, and anything they could glean from their starborne cousins, and they brought these wonders back to their home.": "与矮人一样，赫斯蒙的半身人在没有重大冲突的情况下实现了向星空的飞跃；但与矮人不同的是，他们并不是主动这样做的。鉴于半身人一般都很长寿，并且把个人自由和社区放在最重要的位置上，赫斯蒙的人并不急于逃离他们的田园世界。直到近三千年前，一艘急需修理的矮人飞船坠落在他们的世界上，半身人既不知道，也不可能关心，银河系中还有其他智能生命形式。不过，赫斯蒙德以外的生命的发现，激发了小民的巨大流浪欲望：许多人急切地跟随矮人回到太空中，以适当地满足银河系的其他成员。这些流浪的半身人了解了所有关于太空飞行的内部运作、大嘴、星星，以及他们可以从星际表亲那里收集到的任何东西，并将这些奇迹带回了他们的家园。",
	"Since their introduction to the galactic community, halflings have carved themselves a modest but indispensable place in the 'verse. The small folk quickly took to nearly any place they could get new bits and baubles to trade for, new foods to try, and new creatures to meet; similarly, these places took in the halflings with little trouble, as they were to a man the friendliest and most charitable people that most folks in the 'verse had met. They were also, as it turned out, incredibly skilled when it came to matters of coin, and displayed a particularly high level of business acumen. Within a hundred years, small groups of halflings had installed themselves at nearly every major port, maw, and space station, acting as money-changers, bankers, and impartial legal representatives. Soon after, the Hearthing Collective had been established, and numerous, hospitable, loyalty- neutral Hearthstations had been set up throughout the explored galaxy. Within a millennium, the halflings (with the aid of the dwarves and elves) established the Galactic Bank and successfully lobbied to standardize galactic currency. Now, three thousand years after their first introduction to the stars, the halflings control nearly every bank, trading house, auction house, and money-lender in the galaxy, in addition to the Hearthstations sprinkled throughout the Black.": "自从他们被引入银河系社会，半身人就在 \"诗篇 \"中占据了一个适度但不可或缺的位置。这些小家伙们很快就去了几乎所有他们能得到新的物品和饰品来交换、新的食物来尝试、新的生物来认识的地方；同样地，这些地方也不费吹灰之力就接纳了半身人，因为他们是大多数人在 \"诗篇 \"中遇到的最友好和最慈善的人。事实证明，当涉及到钱币的问题时，他们也有令人难以置信的技能，并表现出特别高的商业头脑水平。在一百年内，一小群半身人已经在几乎所有的主要港口、巨口和空间站安家，充当货币兑换商、银行家和公正的法律代表。不久之后，Hearthing Collective成立了，无数好客的、忠诚度中立的Hearthstations被建立在整个探索的星系中。在一千年内，半身人（在矮人和精灵的帮助下）建立了银河银行，并成功地游说了银河系货币的标准化。现在，在他们首次进入星际的三千年后，半身人几乎控制了银河系的所有银行、贸易行、拍卖行和放债人，此外还有遍布黑衣人的炉灶。",
	"It is whispered in some of the darker corners of the galaxy that the halflings control not only most of the money, but also most of the organized crime. Most of these whisperers vanish without a trace in the days following such a claim, perhaps due to a sudden and extreme desire to go on deep-space exploration.": "在银河系的一些黑暗角落里，有人悄悄地说，半身人不仅控制着大部分的钱，而且还控制着大部分有组织的犯罪。这些耳语者大多在这种说法之后的几天内消失得无影无踪，也许是由于突然极度渴望去深空探索。",
	"While there are halflings who do strike out on adventures, they are considered rather eccentric; most halflings are content to live their lives privily, unconcerned about the rest of the galaxy's worries. That said, halflings are often sought out by many spacers as crewmen, cooks, and other non-combatant roles on many ships. The presence of even a single halfling aboard a ship can raise crew morale, not only because they bring the comforts of home with them wherever they go, but also because their fearlessness is infectious: many are the traveler's tales where a ship was pulled back into the sky by the grit of its captain, the skill of its pilot, and the bravery of its cook.": "虽然有些半身人确实在冒险，但他们被认为是相当古怪的；大多数半身人满足于私下里的生活，不关心银河系其他地方的忧虑。尽管如此，半身人经常被许多太空人寻找，作为船员、厨师和其他非战斗人员在许多船上的角色。即使一个半身人出现在船上，也能提高船员的士气，这不仅是因为他们无论走到哪里都能带来家的舒适感，而且还因为他们的无畏精神具有感染力：许多旅行者的故事中，一艘船被船长的勇气、飞行员的技术和厨师的勇敢拉回了天空。",

	"Rather than carrying hard currency in the form of gold, silver, and copper pieces, the GM can decide that the Galactic Bank deals exclusively in a form of currency called {@b Credits}, which is more secure and far more convenient. One credit is worth the same amount as one gold piece, and a single credit can also be broken up into hundredths, making it possible to represent copper and silver pieces as well.": "与其携带金银铜块形式的硬通货，总经理可以决定银河银行完全以一种称为{@b Credits}的货币形式进行交易，这更安全，也更方便。一个信用点的价值与一个金币相同，而且一个信用点还可以分解成百分之一，这样就可以代表铜币和银币。",
	"Credits are stored digitally on a network of arcane terminals, accessible through personal datapads. The result of this is that money can't simply be pilfered off corpses, nor can it be physically stolen from player characters; rather, financial crime must be more sophisticated, making use of hacking or fraud to secure ill-gotten gains.": "信用额度以数字方式存储在一个神秘的终端网络上，可以通过个人数据板访问。这样做的结果是，钱不能简单地从尸体上偷取，也不能从玩家角色身上偷取；相反，金融犯罪必须更加复杂，利用黑客或欺诈来确保不义之财。",
	"Of the starfaring races of the 'verse, only the vect are truly younger than humans, and none have less total time in the sky. Yet, despite that, since the day the first human astronauts bootstrapped their way from High Terra to the stars, their expansion has been quick, rash, and almost virulent. Within five generations, humans were amongst the most populous races in the galaxy. Despite having a relatively short lifespan, their adaptability, ingenuity, almost comical lack of concern for their own well-being, (along with their apparent ability to crossbreed with nearly any type of humanoid) makes them a force in the galaxy that can't be ignored.": "在星际航行的种族中，只有维克特人真正比人类年轻，而且在天空中的总时间也不长。然而，尽管如此，自从第一批人类宇航员从High Terra走向星空的那一天起，他们的扩张就变得迅速、草率，而且几乎是剧烈的。在五代之内，人类成为银河系中人口最多的种族之一。尽管他们的寿命相对较短，但他们的适应性、独创性和对自身福祉近乎滑稽的不关心，（加上他们与几乎任何类型的类人生物杂交的明显能力）使他们成为银河系中不可忽视的力量。",
	"In the decades prior to their spaceward expansion, the humans endured a series of nearly cataclysmic wars on High Terra. Were it not for a secretive group of world leaders banding together out of mutual self-interest on the eve of their own self-destruction, humanity might have snuffed itself out before it truly began. That secretive cabal of leaders went on to build the foundations of the Human Alliance. Within a decade of this new, united humankind working towards space colonization, they had colonized all twenty planets in its home system, discovered Void-based FTL travel, and sent their first delegation of ambassadors to their nearest maw.": "在他们向太空扩张之前的几十年里，人类在High Terra上经历了一系列几乎是灾难性的战争。如果不是一群秘密的世界领袖在他们自我毁灭的前夜出于相互的利益而联合起来，人类可能在真正开始之前就已经自我毁灭了。这个秘密的领导人集团继续建立了人类联盟的基础。在这个新的、团结的人类致力于太空殖民的十年内，他们已经殖民了其母星系统中的所有20颗行星，发现了基于虚空的超光速旅行，并向他们最近的大嘴派出了他们的第一个大使代表团。",
	"Not merely content with owning their own small piece of space, humanity exploded outwards. Under the guidance of the legendary wizard {@b Gregorian Terminus}, the human alliance stretched itself to the edges of its reach. Colonizing and conquering world after world with force, bartering, mutual partnership, political marriages, and any other tactic they could use to ingratiate themselves with the discovered local cultures, the Alliance become large enough to potentially usurp galactic balance.": "人类不仅仅满足于拥有自己的一小块空间，而是向外爆发。在传奇巫师{@b Gregorian Terminus}的指导下，人类联盟将自己的触角伸向了边缘。通过武力、易货贸易、相互合作、政治联姻以及任何其他他们可以用来讨好被发现的当地文化的策略，殖民和征服了一个又一个世界，联盟变得足够大，有可能篡夺银河系的平衡。",
	"Expansion, however peaceful or beneficial, always runs to a stopping point. In this instance, it was simultaneous encounters on either side of Alliance space with two massive armadas: on one side, a seemingly endless Forest of elven tree-ships, and on the other, the ramshackle, flame-spewing ships of the Warhorde. The war proper lasted for only a single year, but in that time, each fleet rained destruction on each other the like of which the galaxy had not seen since the Night Crusade. In the end, the Warhorde was pushed back and treaties were signed with the elves, but the Alliance had been split in two. As the borders of Alliance space are very nearly bisected by an impassible Dead Magic Zone, the two \"halves\" of the Alliance had been left to fight their part of the war on their own.": "扩张，无论多么和平或有益，总是会跑到一个停止点。在这个例子中，它是在联盟空间的两边同时遭遇两支庞大的舰队：一边是似乎无穷无尽的精灵树船森林，另一边是破烂不堪、喷发火焰的战神船。这场战争只持续了一年，但在这段时间里，每支舰队都对对方进行了破坏，这是银河系自夜袭以来从未见过的。最后，沃霍德被击退，并与精灵族签订了条约，但联盟却被一分为二。由于联盟空间的边界几乎被一个不可逾越的死亡魔法区一分为二，联盟的两个 \"半边 \"被留在了自己的部分战争中。",
	"Around High Terra, the independent worlds of the Alliance leaned heavily on the leadership and military of the Terran government and Chancellor Gregorian Terminus during the conflict with the elves. Following the end of the war, it was decided in a landslide election to reform the Alliance into the Terran Hegemony: all independent worlds of the Alliance would become sovereign territory of High Terra and would follow its rule above all else.": "在High Terra周围，联盟的独立世界在与精灵的冲突中严重依赖Terran政府和大法官Gregorian Terminus的领导和军事。战争结束后，在一次压倒性的选举中决定将联盟改革为泰伦霸权：联盟的所有独立世界都将成为高等泰拉的主权领土，并遵循其高于一切的规则。",
	"Terminus himself was elected Arch-Chancellor of the new Hegemony and led its post-war reformation and reconstruction efforts. No one is quite sure when Terminus, an accomplished wizard, underwent the Rite of Lichdom, but by the time he turned 150 years old, it was clear that Terminus had become an immortal lich. However, with the strength of the Hegemony growing, and in deference to his considerable power, Terminus saw no public opposition for two hundred years of leadership.": "特米纳斯本人被选为新霸权的大统领，领导其战后的改革和重建工作。没有人很清楚Terminus这个有成就的巫师是什么时候接受了Lichdom仪式的，但在他150岁的时候，很明显Terminus已经成为一个不朽的巫师。然而，随着霸权的力量不断增强，为了尊重他的巨大力量，Terminus在两百年的领导生涯中没有看到公众的反对。",
	"Once all was said and done, Terminus stepped down from the position he had held for two centuries and handed the reins to the first of many High Chancellors, Dominus Arcto III, who set the standard for all High Chancellors to follow. Terminus, immortal as he is, still maintains some pull on the dealings of High Terra, and has maintained a permanent position as advisor to the High Chancellor since his abdication. Some whisper that he still controls the seat of power, but none have been able to substantiate this claim.": "当所有的事情都完成后，Terminus从他担任了两个世纪的职位上退了下来，把权力交给了第一位大统领，Dominus Arcto III，他为所有大统领制定了标准。特米纳斯，尽管他是不朽的，但仍然对泰拉高地的交易保持着一定的影响力，并且在他退位后一直保持着大统领顾问的永久职位。有些人低声说他仍然控制着权力的位置，但没有人能够证实这种说法。",
	"Left to their own, cut off from supplies, and facing down a seemingly invincible orcish horde, the army garrisoned at the human outpost of Lakshay declared martial law on all Alliance space on their side of the Dead Magic Zone, and conscripted every able citizen of the Alliance in the surrounding systems to the war effort. Remarkably, they pushed back the Warhorde and retook many of the colonies that had been lost to the green-skinned menace. Upon hearing orders of supplication to a world government who had left them to die, the Lakshayan armies split from the newly-formed Hegemony and declared themselves an independent military dictatorship under the rule of General Sun Wokung, \"The Celestial Dragon.\"": "驻扎在人类前哨站拉克西的军队在死亡魔区一侧的所有联盟空间宣布了戒严令，并征召了周围系统中所有有能力的联盟公民参加战争。令人瞩目的是，他们击退了沃霍德，并重新夺回了许多被绿皮威胁夺去的殖民地。在听到对一个让他们自生自灭的世界政府的祈求命令后，拉克萨亚军队从新成立的霸权中分裂出来，宣布自己为独立的军事独裁政权，由 \"天龙 \"孙悟空将军统治。",
	"Now, hundreds of years later, the Hegemony and Lakshay maintain an uneasy peace, and each are a considerable power in the universe. The Hegemony, under its current High Chancellor, Terminus VI, leads humanity to expand to all corners of the galaxy. In contrast, the Lakshayans, with nearly all of their population armed, trained, and ready for battle, maintain one of the most powerful standing armies ever formed; it is only the ever-looming threat of another Warhorde that keeps them garrisoned, unable to spread themselves any thinner.": "几百年后的今天，霸权主义和拉克西保持着不稳定的和平，各自都是宇宙中的一个相当大的力量。霸权在其现任大统领Terminus VI的领导下，带领人类向银河系的各个角落扩张。相比之下，拉克萨伊人，几乎所有的人都武装起来，训练有素，随时准备战斗，保持着有史以来最强大的常备军之一；只是另一个战神的威胁不断逼近，让他们驻扎在这里，无法再分散自己的力量。",
	"Humans both inside and outside the Hegemony are legendary for their tenacity and \"get it done\" attitude. With the exception of halflings, no other race places more value on its personal freedom than humans. Despite the somewhat oppressive nature of the Hegemony, its citizens are afforded numerous rights and assurances for comparatively little input. Additionally, unlike the more xenophobic elves, humans are more accepting of other races, ranging from the humanoid, to the completely alien, to the dizzying array of near-humans and half-breeds that populate their worlds.": "霸权内外的人类都因其坚韧和 \"完成任务 \"的态度而成为传奇。除了半身人之外，没有其他种族比人类更重视其个人自由。尽管霸权有一定的压迫性，但它的公民在相对较少的投入下获得了许多权利和保证。此外，与更加排外的精灵不同，人类更加接受其他种族，从类人生物，到完全的外星人，再到令人眼花缭乱的近似人类和混血儿，都在他们的世界中存在。",
	"Humans seem to take especially well to life on the maws. No other single race, with the exception of the amoeboids, is more strongly represented among permanent maw residents. Because of this, humans may be the most widespread race in the galaxy, and are assuredly the most likely to colonize Frontier worlds. Many companies specifically seek out large groups of humans when attempting to settle new worlds, especially worlds that are Tier 3 or above: ingenuity has inherent value, and humans have ingenuity in their blood.": "人类似乎特别适合在巨口上生活。除了变形金刚之外，没有任何一个种族在巨口的永久居民中具有更强的代表性。正因为如此，人类可能是银河系中最广泛的种族，而且肯定是最有可能殖民边疆世界的种族。许多公司在试图定居新的世界时，特别是在3级或以上的世界中，专门寻找大量的人类群体：聪明才智具有固有的价值，而人类的血液中就有聪明才智。",
	"The inborn love for freedom and the tenacity for acquiring resources has a darker side, though. Despite their generally peaceful nature, no other non-goblinoid race counts as many pirates, brigands, and mercenaries amongst their ranks. In general, this does little to sour the galactic reputation of mankind, except to affirm the one bit of knowledge that always remains true: when dealing with humans, you never know what you're going to get.": "不过，对自由的天生热爱和获取资源的顽强精神也有黑暗的一面。尽管他们总体上是和平的，但在他们的队伍中，没有其他非哥布林人的种族有这么多海盗、强盗和雇佣兵。总的来说，这对人类在银河系的声誉没有什么影响，只是肯定了一个永远正确的知识点：当与人类打交道时，你永远不知道你会得到什么。",
	"A myriad of near-humans, from the green-skinned to simians, are almost as numerous as ordinary humans and should be considered a normal part of any human settlement.": "无数的近人，从绿皮人到类人猿，几乎和普通人一样多，应该被认为是任何人类定居点的正常组成部分。",
	"The fishlike nautilids are now fewer than they ever have been. At its height, the nautilid race was a force to be feared, with a fleet that fought alongside the elves in the Crusades and an indomitable homeworld, named Poseidon for its endless oceans. Alas, this was never to last. When the cruel fires of their home star consumed Poseidon, the nautilid race was left adrift in their ships, searching for another world that could support them.": "像鱼一样的鹦鹉螺现在比以往任何时候都少。在其鼎盛时期，鹦鹉螺族是一股令人敬畏的力量，他们拥有一支在十字军东征中与精灵并肩作战的舰队和一个不屈不挠的家园，因其无尽的海洋而被命名为波塞冬。唉，这永远不会持续。当他们的母星的残酷大火吞噬了波塞冬时，鹦鹉螺族被留在他们的船上漂流，寻找另一个可以支持他们的世界。",
	"Poseidon was a world of unique composition—a mixture of rare elements and gases was dissolved in its deep oceans. This liquid, known as the Poseidon Solution, is central to the nautilids' biology. Though the nautilid possess great intelligence and are swift underwater, the Solution also allowed them to grow large, for minerals in the Solution facilitate extremely efficient gas transfer into their gills. Nautilids are technically amphibious, possessing both a set of lungs and gills, but venturing too long without the Solution makes respiration difficult. Thus, nautilids ships and aqua suits are filled with Poseidon Solution.": "波塞冬是一个具有独特成分的世界--稀有元素和气体的混合物被溶解在其深海中。这种液体被称为 \"海神溶液\"，是鹦鹉螺类生物的核心。尽管鹦鹉螺拥有巨大的智慧，在水下也很敏捷，但溶液也使它们能够长得很大，因为溶液中的矿物质有利于极其有效的气体转移到它们的鳃中。鹦鹉螺在技术上是两栖动物，同时拥有一套肺和鳃，但在没有溶液的情况下冒险太久会使呼吸困难。因此，鹦鹉螺类的船只和潜水服都充满了海神溶液。",
	"Ultimately, the blessings of the Poseidon Solution have become a curse. Long they have searched, but the nautilids have never found an oceanic planet with similar enough waters to the Solution to start anew, nor can the properties of Poseidon simply be terraformed into a new planet. Nautilid populations are in steady decline, and have been for generations, for only aboard ships with ample Solution can nautilid infants be born.": "最终，波塞冬溶液的祝福变成了诅咒。他们寻找了很久，但鹦鹉螺人从来没有找到一个与溶液有足够相似水域的海洋行星来重新开始，海神的特性也不能简单地被改造成一个新星球。鹦鹉螺的数量在持续下降，而且已经持续了好几代，因为只有在有充足溶液的飞船上，鹦鹉螺的婴儿才能出生。",
	"From their large and water-filled Whorl ships, the nautilids have systematically combed the galaxy for planets that have the potential to become New Poseidon. Every lead and every clue are analyzed, without exception. In pursuit of this goal, nautilid scientists have pushed the boundaries of exploration and colonization, so far, to no avail. Finding the right planet is like picking a single drop from a sea of stars, if that drop even exists.": "鹦鹉螺们从他们大型的、充满水的Whorl飞船上，系统地梳理了银河系中那些有可能成为新海神的行星。每条线索和每条线索都要进行分析，没有例外。为了追求这一目标，鹦鹉螺号的科学家们已经突破了探索和殖民的界限，到目前为止，还没有结果。找到合适的星球就像从星海中挑出一滴，如果那一滴真的存在的话。",
	"It is no secret what is on the line: the nautilids are in an agonizingly slow race against extinction; right now, unfortunately, they're losing.": "这已经不是什么秘密了：鹦鹉螺正处于一场令人痛苦的缓慢的灭绝竞赛中；现在，不幸的是，它们正在输。",
	"Goblinoid violence is nothing new; hobgoblins, bugbears, goblins, and gnolls share a history of wars and atrocities too long to list. But much of their history is terrestrial, spread across isolated planets over an entire galactic quadrant. The story is much the same for the orcs—until the development of the arcane warhead, they were planetbound.": "妖精的暴力不是什么新鲜事；霍布林、虫族、地精和地精都有一段很长的战争和暴行的历史，不胜枚举。但他们的历史大部分是陆地上的，分布在整个银河系象限内的孤立星球上。兽人的故事也是如此--在开发出奥术弹头之前，他们都是以星球为单位。",
	"Things may have never changed were it not for the intervention of avia-ra missionaries, who landed on the orc homeworld of Or'n to spread the word of the Sun Above. They were not remotely successful—in fact, they were promptly gunned down by orcish military—but the discovery of worlds beyond their own, along with a single working Dark Matter drive, shunted the orcs onto a technological path ending in disaster.": "如果不是avia-ra传教士的介入，事情可能永远不会改变，他们登陆了兽人的家园Or'n，传播太阳神的话语。他们并没有取得多大的成功--事实上，他们很快就被兽人军队击毙了--但是，超越他们自己的世界的发现，以及一个可以工作的暗物质驱动器，使兽人走上了一条以灾难结束的技术道路。",
	"Whereas the elves and dwarves saw the potential of Dark Matter technology to power their worlds and travel the far reaches of space, the orcish military knew they had discovered a weapon. Within a decade, an orc faction scraped together a crude bomb using the technology and dropped it on a city of their enemies; to their surprise and everyone's horror, millions died in an instant.": "精灵和矮人看到了黑暗物质技术为他们的世界提供动力和在遥远的太空中旅行的潜力，而兽人军队则知道他们发现了一种武器。在十年内，一个兽人派别利用该技术拼凑了一个粗糙的炸弹，并将其投向他们敌人的城市；令他们惊讶和所有人惊恐的是，数百万人在一瞬间死去。",
	"The weapon was the first of its kind, but not the last. They would later come to be called arcane warheads, devices that warp the fabric of magic to its breaking point, tearing a hole and unleashing a devastating explosion. Each warhead leaves behind a permanent hole in the fabric of magic—a spherical Dead Magic Zone, normally a few dozen feet across, which drifts through space indefinitely or clings to the ground at the point of detonation. No weapon in history has proved more catastrophic or terrifying.": "这种武器是第一种，但不是最后一种。它们后来被称为奥术弹头，是将魔法结构扭曲到其断裂点的装置，撕裂一个洞并释放出毁灭性的爆炸。每个弹头都会在魔法结构中留下一个永久的洞--一个球形的 \"死亡魔法区\"，通常有几十英尺宽，无限期地在空间中漂移，或者在爆炸点附着在地面上。历史上没有任何一种武器被证明是更具有灾难性或更可怕的。",
	"The arms race that followed the first arcane warhead was as precipitous as it was volatile. In addition to simply building tens of thousands of warheads, most orc factions became obsessed with gaining the high ground on their enemies. First taking to space, orcs positioned arcane warheads in orbit, then installed missile silos on their moons. Each move brought the orc war tide further out into space and inched orckind closer to doomsday.": "第一枚奥术弹头之后的军备竞赛既险峻又动荡。除了简单地建造数以万计的弹头外，大多数兽人派别都痴迷于在他们的敌人面前获得制高点。兽人首先进入太空，将奥术弹头安置在轨道上，然后在他们的卫星上安装导弹发射井。每一次行动都将兽人的战争浪潮进一步推向太空，使兽人离末日越来越近。",
	"No one knows for sure who fired the first shot, but suddenly, all at once, the missiles were launched. In a chorus of explosions, Or'n was reduced to a smoldering, lifeless rock. Hundreds of millions perished in the inferno; millions more, however, survived among the stars.": "没有人确切知道是谁开的第一枪，但突然间，所有的导弹都被发射出去。在一连串的爆炸声中，奥恩变成了一块燃烧的、没有生命的岩石。数以亿计的人在地狱中丧生；然而，还有数百万人在星空中幸存下来。",
	"The remaining orcs continued their bitter fight in other systems (bringing their arcane warheads with them), eventually cobbling together or capturing low-class Dark Matter engines to extend their territories. When they arrived in other systems, the orcish militaries conscripted or allied with the other goblinoids+ they discovered, embroiling all goblinkind in their eternal war. Before long, the orcish armies were a mishmash of bugbears, gnolls, and hobgoblins, and the orcish war devolved into something not wholly their own.": "剩下的兽人在其他星系继续他们的苦战（带着他们的奥术弹头），最终拼凑或俘获了低级别的黑暗物质引擎来扩大他们的领土。当他们到达其他系统时，兽人军队征召或与他们发现的其他地精+结盟，将所有地精卷入他们永恒的战争中。不久之后，兽人军队就成了虫人、地精和妖精的混合体，兽人的战争演变成了不完全属于他们自己的东西。",
	"The swarm of shifting alliances, bitter rivalries, and splintering factions are collectively called the Warhorde, for no single coalition remains dominant for long. Sometimes, the Warhorde will focus its attention on some outside threat, like the expansion of humans at Lakshay, but such distractions are as rare as they are short-lived. Most of the time, the daily politics of the goblinoid factions preoccupies the Warzone, and the goblinoid factions rarely venture outside their space.": "这群不断变化的联盟、激烈的竞争和分裂的派别被统称为Warhorde，因为没有一个联盟能长期保持主导地位。有时，Warhorde会把注意力集中在一些外部威胁上，比如人类在拉克西的扩张，但这种分散注意力的情况很少，因为它们是短暂的。大多数时候，地精派系的日常政治都是战区的重中之重，地精派系也很少冒险离开他们的空间。",
	"The goblinoid conflict is contained to a swath of the galaxy called the Warzone, which is littered with dead magic pockets from an unending rain of arcane warheads. After centuries of fighting, few easily-habitable planets are left within the zone, and the orcs, which once started this war, have become as orphaned as the nautilids. The great orcish war is long-forgotten; few even remember the nations of Or'n or what they once battled over. While most orcs would rather see the war put to rest, the goblinoid factions continue their eternal march of war.": "妖精族的冲突被控制在银河系中一个被称为 \"战争区 \"的地方，那里到处都是被无休止的奥术弹头雨摧毁的魔法口袋。经过几个世纪的战斗，该区域内几乎没有容易居住的星球了，而曾经引发这场战争的兽人，已经和鹦鹉螺一样成为了孤儿。伟大的兽人战争早已被遗忘；甚至很少有人记得奥恩的国家或他们曾经为之战斗的东西。虽然大多数兽人宁愿看到战争平息，但地精派别仍在继续他们永恒的战争征程。",
	"Easily the most primitive of the space-bound races, the hulking, insectoid skathári are at best reluctant participants in the galactic community, and at worst, isolated Luddite tribes. They have spread further than dwarves and elves, occupying as many planets as humans; despite this, it's rare to catch sight of a skathári on a Hearthstation, spaceport, or maw, and it's even rarer to strike up a conversation with one.": "笨重的昆虫类Skathári很容易成为最原始的太空种族，他们充其量只是不情愿地参与银河系社会，而最糟糕的是，他们是孤立的鲁德部落。他们比矮人和精灵传播得更远，占据了和人类一样多的星球；尽管如此，在壁炉站、太空港或大嘴里很少能看到Skathári的身影，而和他们交谈更是少之又少。",
	"When a dwarven mining expedition set foot on the mountainous, inhospitable world of Kopriá, they expected to find rich veins of adamantine ore, and if they were extremely fortunate, a small Roach population to sell on the side. To their utter delight, they found both, along with a third surprise, the skathári: a sprawling population of hardy insectoid creatures, rugged enough to bear the planet's harsh gravity, sulfurous atmosphere, and rocky soil. The stout insectoids impressed the dwarven visitors, who marveled over their durability and brawn, along with their uncanny regenerative abilities.": "当一支矮人采矿探险队踏上Kopriá这个多山、荒凉的世界时，他们期望能找到丰富的金刚砂矿脉，如果他们非常幸运的话，还能找到一小批蟑螂作为副业出售。令他们欣喜若狂的是，他们找到了这两样东西，还有第三个惊喜--Skathári：一个由坚韧的昆虫类生物组成的庞大种群，其坚固程度足以承受这个星球严酷的重力、含硫的大气和岩石质地。这些强壮的昆虫给矮人访客留下了深刻的印象，他们对自己的耐用性和体力，以及不可思议的再生能力感到惊叹。",
	"Enterprising as ever, the dwarves offered the tribe a deal: for a year's supply of food, they could leave their planet and work in a dwarven mining operation. At the year's end, they would return with another year's supply of food for their families. Most skathári were skeptical of the offer, but a few were intrigued enough by the prospect to volunteer.": "矮人一如既往地富有进取心，他们向部落提出了一个交易：只要有一年的食物供应，他们就可以离开自己的星球，在矮人的采矿作业中工作。在一年结束时，他们将带着另一年的食物供应给他们的家人回来。大多数Skathári人对这个提议持怀疑态度，但也有少数人被这个前景所吸引，自愿前往。",
	"On the equally harsh dwarven mining world, the skathári made stout, hard workers, exemplary at moving rocks and scaling cliff sides, but refused to make use of any technology. Dwarven engineers made many attempts to teach them how to use simple devices, such as plasma cutters and thermal lances, but to no lasting avail. Most skathári resorted to crafting clubs to chisel away at ore, or simply bashed rocks together.": "在同样严酷的矮人采矿世界中，斯卡塔里人是粗壮的苦力，在搬运岩石和攀爬悬崖边上堪称典范，但拒绝使用任何技术。矮人工程师曾多次尝试教他们如何使用简单的设备，如等离子切割机和热喷枪，但都无济于事。大多数斯卡塔里人只能靠制作棍棒来凿开矿石，或者干脆把石头砸在一起。",
	"After a long year of poor yields and frustrated dwarven miners, the dwarves armed a scrap golem (retrofitted for mining) to collect their itinerant skathári workers. But when they arrived, the skathári were missing, having fled into the barren mountains. The dwarves convinced themselves that the skathári workers would eventually starve or freeze to death on the barren world, and that they needn't concern themselves with correcting their mistake, but to their surprise and grievance, the skathári were there to stay. This was the first of many harsh, nearly lifeless worlds to become a skathári home.": "在经历了漫长的产量低下和矮人矿工沮丧的一年后，矮人武装了一个废旧的巨兽（为采矿而改装）去收集他们的流动的Skathári工人。但当他们到达时，Skathári却失踪了，他们已经逃到了荒山中。矮人相信Skathári工人最终会饿死或冻死在贫瘠的世界上，他们不需要担心纠正他们的错误，但令他们惊讶和不满的是，Skathári在那里呆着。这是许多严酷的、几乎没有生命的世界中的第一个，成为Skathári的家园。",
	"The inhospitable conditions of skathári worlds don't bother them in the least. Their ability to comfortably survive in extreme temperatures, thin or poisonous atmospheres, and rough terrain allow them to thrive, just as they did on their home planet. If there is a way to survive on any planet, skathári find it and adapt.": "skathári世界的荒凉条件丝毫不影响他们。他们有能力在极端温度、稀薄或有毒的大气层以及崎岖的地形中舒适地生存，这使他们能够茁壮成长，就像他们在母星上一样。如果有办法在任何星球上生存，Skathári会找到并适应它。",
	"Though most skathári are loath to ride in spacecraft for any reason, a few grin and bear it (generally clinging to the floor for the duration of the flight). Commonly, traveling skathári try to ignore most technology, and even pretend that constructs, including vect, simply aren't there. And with these occasional hops across the inky blackness of space, skathári have steadily expanded on the margins of the galaxy.": "虽然大多数Skathári不愿意以任何理由乘坐航天器，但也有少数人忍气吞声（一般在飞行过程中紧贴着地板）。通常情况下，旅行中的Skathári试图无视大多数技术，甚至假装包括vect在内的构造物根本不存在。随着这些偶尔的跳跃穿越墨黑的太空，Skathári在银河系的边缘地带稳步扩张。",
	"The constructs which preceded the vect were immense and complexly designed, usually based on the skeletons of iron golems and driven by inexhaustible construct cores. These hulking machines were set to work mining ores from asteroids and stripping derelict ships for parts. However powerful and effective, these machines were bulky, costly, and could only follow simple directives. Dwarven engineers sought a solution: a smarter, sleeker, and more universal construct. Thus, the first designs of vect-style machines were drafted.": "在vect之前的构造物都是巨大的、设计复杂的，通常以铁甲虫的骨架为基础，由取之不尽的构造核心驱动。这些笨重的机器被用来从小行星上开采矿石，并将废弃的船只拆成零件。尽管强大而有效，这些机器还是很笨重、昂贵，而且只能遵循简单的指令。矮人工程师们寻求一种解决方案：一种更聪明、更圆滑、更通用的构造。因此，第一批vect式机器的设计被起草出来。",
	"The dwarves could not, however, simply build such constructs. The new vect designs called for deeply intricate mechanics, with a complex circulatory system to regulate the smaller bodies. More confounding still, the vect needed a new type of construct core, more dynamic and driven by greater types of magic.": "然而，矮人不可能简单地建造这样的建筑。新的vect设计需要复杂的机械装置，有一个复杂的循环系统来调节较小的身体。更令人困惑的是，vect需要一种新型的构造核心，更有活力，并由更大类型的魔法驱动。",
	"The dwarven solution was utterly ingenious: rather than designing and building the vect units individually, the dwarves would engineer a massive and complex facility, essentially a single intelligent magic item the size of a stadium, called a {@b Foundry}. A single Foundry is all that would ever be needed, for it could oversee the finer details of all vect units, adapting them with new designs as flaws were discovered.": "矮人的解决方案是完全巧妙的：与其单独设计和建造vect单元，矮人将设计一个巨大而复杂的设施，本质上是一个单一的智能魔法物品，有一个体育场那么大，叫做（%0%）。一个单一的铸造厂是永远需要的，因为它可以监督所有vect单元的精细细节，在发现缺陷时用新的设计来调整它们。",
	"Satisfied that they had designed the perfect construct, the ideal means to eliminate laborers forever, the dwarves set about the painstaking task of constructing the first Foundry ship in orbit above their homeworld, Jormund.": "矮人确信他们已经设计出了完美的建筑，是永远消除劳工的理想手段，于是他们开始了艰苦的工作，在他们的家园--约蒙的轨道上建造第一艘铸造厂的飞船。",
	"When activated, the Jormund Foundry set about its work completely autonomously. Tens of thousands of vect were created and sold throughout the 'verse, often to the highest bidder in batches of thousands. Even more vect were created to work aboard the Foundry itself, soon eliminating the need for any dwarven hands on the satellite and increasing efficiency tenfold.": "激活后，乔蒙德铸造厂完全自主地开始工作。数以万计的vect被制造出来，并在整个'se'中出售，通常是以数千人的批次出售给出价最高的人。甚至有更多的vect被制造出来在铸造厂内工作，很快就不需要矮人在卫星上工作了，效率提高了十倍。",
	"The Foundry optimized and learned at a staggering rate. As its astounding intelligence grew, the ship became pensive, speaking rarely and with profound meaning. Perhaps it struggled to communicate its transcendent thoughts to its simple dwarven creators, so it fell silent, expanded its intellect further, and worked to perfect its vect creations.": "铸造厂以惊人的速度优化和学习。随着它惊人的智慧的增长，这艘船变得沉思起来，很少说话，但意义深远。也许它很难向其简单的矮人创造者传达其超然的思想，所以它陷入了沉默，进一步扩展其智力，并努力完善其vect创造。",
	"All was well before the Spark. Suddenly, less than a decade after the Foundry began its work, every vect unit in the 'verse awoke at once, moving and communicating as if they were alive. Dwarven engineers were dumbfounded, but before they could inspect the Jormund Foundry directly, a massive tear in space opened around it; somehow, the Foundry had constructed a Dark Matter engine and jumped to destinations unknown.": "在 \"火花 \"之前，一切都很好。突然间，在铸造厂开始工作不到十年后，'诗篇'中的每一个vect单元都同时醒来，像活着一样移动和交流。矮人工程师们目瞪口呆，但在他们能够直接检查乔蒙德铸造厂之前，它周围的空间出现了一个巨大的裂缝；不知何故，铸造厂建造了一个暗物质引擎，并跳到了未知的目的地。",
	"Across the 'verse, people scrambled to deal with the looming crisis posed by a new race of intelligent constructs. Thousands of vect were imprisoned until some solution could be discovered, while others were dismantled and destroyed by those, especially gnomes and dwarves, who feared a robotic uprising. The ensuing chaos sparked dozens of wars of different planets, pitting vect laborers against their organic masters in a desperate bid for survival. Despite their small numbers, the vect were cunning, adaptable, and tireless; a threat that couldn't be easily squashed. A few built ships, dragging the conflict into deep space, where the vect could fight indefinitely, needing neither food nor water.": "在整个宇宙中，人们争先恐后地处理一个新的智能建筑种族所带来的迫在眉睫的危机。成千上万的vect被囚禁起来，直到发现某种解决方案，而其他的vect则被那些担心机器人起义的人，尤其是地精和矮人，拆解和摧毁。随之而来的混乱引发了几十场不同星球的战争，使vect劳动者与他们的有机体主人对立起来，为生存而不顾一切。尽管数量不多，但vect人很狡猾，适应性强，而且不知疲倦；这是一个不容易被压制的威胁。一些人建造了飞船，将冲突拖入深空，在那里，vect可以无限期地战斗，既不需要食物也不需要水。",
	"As wars against the vect became prolonged, it became clear that no solution for their sentience could easily be found. Worse still, vect numbers were not declining; they were growing.": "随着针对vect的战争的延长，很明显，不可能轻易找到解决他们的智能的办法。更糟糕的是，vect的数量并没有减少，而是在增长。",
	"Vect production had not stopped or even slowed. From deep in the Black, the Jormund Foundry continued creating vect units, sending them out to the universe in one-time-use Dark Matter pods. Any ship that encountered the Foundry was fired upon, shortly before it jumped again. Even more worrisome, deep-space cruisers started reporting new Foundries, also creating vect units and delivering them across the 'verse.": "探测器的生产没有停止，甚至没有放缓。在 \"黑 \"的深处，乔蒙德铸造厂继续制造 \"矢量 \"单元，将它们装在一次性使用的 \"暗物质 \"吊舱中送往宇宙。任何遇到铸造厂的飞船都会被开火，在它再次跳跃之前不久。更令人担忧的是，深空巡洋舰开始报告新的铸造厂，也在制造vect单元，并将它们运送到整个宇宙。",
	"To everyone's surprise, while gnomes, humans, and dwarves fought vect on land and in space, the elves declared peace with vect across their empire; a bargain struck amid the Night Crusade to secure elvenkind against the avia-ra. Sure enough, this bargain paid off: in the Battle of Alden'Val, the avia-ra fleet was routed and pushed back to the core systems by a fleet of vect ships. Vect freedom was secured in the largest territory in the 'verse, and other factions soon begrudgingly followed suit.": "令所有人惊讶的是，当地精、人类和矮人在陆地和太空中与vect作战时，精灵们却宣布在他们的帝国中与vect和平相处；这是一个在夜间十字军东征中达成的交易，以确保精灵族对抗avia-ra。果然，这个交易得到了回报：在阿尔登瓦尔之战中，avia-ra舰队被击溃，并被vect舰队推回了核心系统。维特人的自由在'诗篇'最大的领土上得到了保障，其他派别也很快勉强地效仿。",
	"Today, the vect live freely across the whole of the 'verse, the only example of living constructs to date. Their numbers are relatively small, but replenished by a steady supply of Dark Matter pods from reaches unseen, evidence that the Foundries are somewhere silently carrying out their duties. Except for a militant few, vect have dismantled their fleets and learned to live alongside other races, becoming regulars in starports and starships the 'verse over, a permanent addition to many a crew.": "今天，vect自由地生活在整个 \"诗篇 \"中，是迄今为止唯一的活体建筑例子。他们的数量相对较少，但通过从看不见的地方源源不断地提供暗物质舱来补充，这证明铸造厂在某个地方默默地履行着他们的职责。除了少数好战分子外，vect已经解散了他们的舰队，并学会了与其他种族一起生活，成为整个宇宙的星港和星舰的常客，成为许多船员的永久补充。",
	"Outside of the major galactic alliances founded by the spacefaring races, there are countless other factions that a well-traveled adventurer may do business for, have a run-in with, or even join as a member. While all factions have a specific goal in mind, be that spreading a belief, exploring unknown worlds, or simply making a lot of money, most have smaller ambitions than the galactic governments and keep their membership open to creatures of many races.": "在航天种族建立的主要星系联盟之外，还有无数的其他派别，一个善于旅行的冒险家可能会为其做生意，与之发生冲突，甚至加入成为成员。虽然所有的派别都有一个特定的目标，无论是传播信仰、探索未知世界，还是简单地赚大钱，但大多数派别的野心都比银河系政府小，并对许多种族的生物开放其成员资格。",
	"Founded nearly two millennia ago, Astrogations Inc. has grown to become the preeminent starfaring guild in the 'verse. Concerned chiefly with accurately charting every system in the galaxy, A.I. has brokered centuries- long contracts with all of the major players in the Black, granting them a near-monopoly over galactic cartography. Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.": "成立于近两千年前，Astrogations Inc.已经成长为'se'中最杰出的星际航行行会。A.I.主要关注的是精确绘制银河系中的每一个系统，它与黑衣人中的所有主要参与者签订了长达几个世纪的合同，使他们几乎垄断了银河系的制图。此外，A.I.还在三千多个不同的停靠港之间提供快速、谨慎的旅行服务，包括网格上的每一个大口。如果你需要去某个地方或找什么东西，在这个世界上没有人比Astrogations公司做得更快。",
	"The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the \"topology\" of the 'verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn't even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.": "A.I.面临的最大问题是，与陆地制图不同，宇宙的 \"拓扑结构 \"是不断变化的。虽然有些点（如大口站）在相对固定的位置围绕银河系核心旋转，但有足够的空间异常、流氓行星和引力通道让一个专门的地图制作者忙上几辈子；这甚至没有考虑到保持银河系政府分界线的准确性和真实性的麻烦。即使是贸易路线上引力的微小变化，也可能使一艘货船坠入一颗恒星，所以极其精确的图表是必须的。",
	"To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company's namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.": "为此，A.I.经营各种信息，从探险家和太空人那里购买星图、行星扫描、虚空跳跃数据和异常事件的扫描。这些信息被编入目录并卖给太空人，以帮助完善导航；卖给主要的银河系大国，以确定他们的边界；并被施法者用来准确地施展天体探测法术，即公司的名字。A.I.在交易中完全中立，它将从任何有意愿的客户那里购买或出售，只要这样做能带来利润。A.I.的总部位于康科迪亚，据说拥有数十万台奥术终端来存储和整理其数据。",
	"Of course, A.I. has one additional trick up its sleeve to stay ahead of the competition: along with employing thousands of star-cartographers and information brokers, A.I. is also rumored to employ a staff of psychics, soothsayers, and oracles who attempt to divine the future of galactic movements. Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.'s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the 'verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future.": "当然，A.I.为了在竞争中保持领先，还有一招：除了雇佣数以千计的星空制图师和信息经纪人之外，据传A.I.还雇佣了一批通灵师、占卜师和神谕师，试图预测银河系的未来动向。很久以前，A.I制图师意识到，虽然一个通灵者的预测可能不可靠，但一百个或更多通灵者的平均预测可以产生持续的真实结果，甚至在未来数年内。甚至有可能A.I.的灵媒智囊团所预测的不仅仅是未来的星系运动；他们的灵媒已经预言了等待'诗篇'的巨大灾难。当然，如果这是真的，A.I.对此事保持沉默，也许希望在未来将这些信息转化为利润。",
	"For one percent, you can expect a one-time payment of 2,000 credits, but we're running a special on the three percent package, which I think you'll find enticing.": "对于1%，你可以期待一次性支付2000个信用点，但我们正在对3%的套餐进行特价，我想你会发现这很诱人。",
	"Across the 'verse, the Cabal is synonymous with devil- summoning and unholy bargains, but to say that they're evil would be an outright exaggeration. The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee's soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee's soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.": "在整个 \"诗篇 \"中，Cabal是恶魔召唤和邪恶交易的同义词，但如果说他们是邪恶的，那就完全是夸大其词了。徒手党是一个有进取心的灵魂经纪人办公室，他们安排有利可图的合同，以换取受雇者的部分灵魂。这种合同是公平的，明确的，而且从不主动提供；此外，大多数合同只用收件人灵魂的一个百分比来交换付款。灵魂的百分之一可能值几千个信用点，而百分之十可以买一艘全新的星舰，为房子付首付，并在银行留下一些余额。收款人可以自由地从一些慷慨的付款方案中做出决定，并及时收到他们的灵魂的付款。",
	"This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn't require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.": "这种签订灵魂契约的方法不仅高效，而且代表了自由市场的胜利。为Cabal工作的灵魂经纪人不需要担心一次为整个灵魂签订凡人的交易；他们每人每年收集几十个灵魂，来自数百个不同的签约者。签署这种合同的人不需要担心被诅咒到下层世界，成为他们交易的一部分；相反，他们可以（可能）期望他们的后世只是被玷污，因为只有他们永恒的灵魂的一部分上升。他们甚至可以回来签署额外的合同。最重要的是，这个过程不需要任何令人厌烦的血腥仪式或邪恶的诱惑，因为Cabal在普通的办公大楼里运作。",
	"The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a high- ranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.": "Cabal是由贝尔先生创立的，他秘密地是一个名叫贝尔法戈的高级魔鬼。在他来到物质世界的时候，灵魂交易是一件笨拙的事情，需要一个生物用它的整个灵魂来换取一个好处，而这个好处很少像灵魂本身一样有价值。虽然这个系统意味着魔鬼几乎总是从他们的交易中获利，但也意味着愿意与他们交换的生物少得多。为了解决这个问题，Belphagor得出了一个凡人灵魂的确切货币价值，以及一个只交易其中一小部分的系统。不久之后，人类的贪婪和自由市场就带着这个想法跑了。贝尔法戈不再需要派小精灵与凡人讨价还价，他们会来找他。在贝尔先生的伪装下，他购买了一间办公室，雇佣了一批铁皮人员工，并以卡巴尔的名义开张营业。",
	"The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams.": "阴谋集团会雇佣任何通过前提法律和经纪考试的人，但更喜欢盗贼雇员，因为他们有天生的银色舌头和地狱之血。灵魂经纪人也可以被雇用来监督其他法律事务，因为大多数灵魂经纪人在参加经纪人考试之前就已经成为合格的律师。",
	"Based on the militarized world of Fraxus-12 on the outer rim, the Coalition is the largest private military corporation in the 'verse. Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition's specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).": "联盟的总部设在外环线上的军事化世界Fraxus-12，是世界上最大的私人军事公司。五百年前由一群叛逃的军事领导人建立，据称联盟拥有一支近十亿的常备军，并拥有与之匹配的舰队。虽然这些数字与精灵、矮人或人类的军事力量相比相形见绌，但联盟的士兵训练有素、装备精良，使他们比任何战斗人员都要强。虽然联盟士兵可以被雇佣为保镖或雇佣兵，但联盟的专长是扭转银河系冲突的趋势（以合适的价格）。",
	"The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier's basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal's word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.": "联盟由一个由将军、海军将领和空中元帅组成的理事会领导，称为战争室。这个由军事专家组成的委员会讨论战术，建立新的军事学说，甚至审议联盟士兵基本制服的变化。战争室由现任高级元帅提伯瑞斯-温特（Tiberious Vinter）主持，他是一个威严的半兽人，拥有近一个世纪的战斗经验和令人印象深刻的胡须。在作战室里，大元帅的话就是法律，他的决定就是最终决定；值得称道的是，文特元帅很少轻率地或未经深思熟虑地做出决定。他和他的委员会都很清楚，他们的行动承载着数百万人的生命，他们都不会掉以轻心。",
	"Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax's Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.": "虽然联盟会加入任何能够负担得起他们服务的战争，但所有的士兵都要遵守严格的战争准则。该守则禁止奴役、种族灭绝、行星破坏（不包括4级和5级世界）和公开的海盗行为。任何被发现从事此类活动的士兵或军官将被立即谴责并接受军事法庭的审判。因此，尽管联盟与其他雇佣兵组织，如格拉克斯的人和规模与方，在同一战区运作，但他们受到一定程度的尊重，使他们从竞争中脱颖而出。",
	"Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition's greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle.": "在其令人难以置信的舰队旁边，联盟最大的资产可能是它的暖气师分会。在人类的裂谷战争中，旧的暖男学院被分成两派，一派是为联盟对抗精灵森林舰队，一派是与拉克西对抗兽人战神。当尘埃落定时，拉克西脱离了联盟，暖男学院承诺为拉克西的新政府献身。暖男的忠诚者感到震惊，许多人叛逃加入了联盟，他们认为联盟是人类联盟之间的一个中立阵营。今天，联盟将暖男作为一支尖端的奥术部队，将战斗性的魔法与新技术相融合，使联盟部队在战场上拥有无与伦比的战术优势。",
	"Based out of four exceedingly high-class offices on the four maws surrounding the galactic core, Drog, Dusset, & Durgen Acquisitions & Trade is the premier high-tier trade organization and antiquities dealer in the galaxy. While other trading guilds deal in ordinary commodities and goods, DD&D concerns itself with only the most exotic and lucrative items, and charges exorbitantly high fees for the trouble. Vast shipments of gold, gems, precious metals such as mithral and adamantine, rare magic items, and artifacts are DD&D's domain.": "Drog, Dusset, & Durgen Acquisitions & Trade是银河系中最重要的高级贸易组织和古董商，其总部设在银河系核心周围的四条巨龙上的四个极其高级的办公室里。当其他贸易行会处理普通商品和货物时，DD&D只关注最奇特和最有利可图的物品，并为其收取高昂的费用。大量的黄金、宝石、贵金属（如密特拉和金刚砂）、稀有的魔法物品和文物是DD&D的领域。",
	"DD&D takes a special interest in traditional magic items, like necklaces of fireballs, wands of wonder, and gauntlets of ogre power, as opposed to items built on modern magical technology, such as motion trackers and transmat decks. These antique items possess an elegance and craftsmanship (not to mention an invaluable rarity) unparalleled in modern items.": "DD&D对传统的魔法物品特别感兴趣，如火球项链、奇迹魔杖和食人魔之铠，而不是基于现代魔法技术的物品，如运动追踪器和透视牌。这些古董物品拥有现代物品无法比拟的优雅和工艺（更不用说宝贵的稀有性）。",
	"Being collectors of antiquities and traders of magic items, DD&D is always in the market for intrepid explorers, brave adventurers, and others who can survive ancient deathtraps in order to plunder its treasures. Of these adventures, the most successful (and longest lived) are offered positions as Artifactors, operating as the organization's premier tradesmen and dungeon delvers. Artifactors plan and oversee DD&D's high profile expeditions, and are afforded exceptional manpower and resources to do so.": "作为古董的收藏家和魔法物品的商人，DD&D总是在市场上寻找无畏的探险家、勇敢的冒险家，以及其他能够在古代死亡陷阱中幸存下来以掠夺其宝藏的人。在这些冒险者中，最成功的（也是最长寿的）被提供了神器的职位，作为该组织最重要的商人和地牢探险者来运作。神器师们计划并监督DD&D的高调探险，并获得了特殊的人力和资源来完成这项工作。",
	"The oft-quoted tale of DD&D's origins involves the titular founders, now all (presumably) long dead, aiding an eternal dragon named Garfreckt in moving its hoard from one edge of space to another. According to the story, the founders discovered a new hoard-planet for the dragon, the remnant core of a dead gas giant, now a planet-sized ball of pure diamond, and helped the dragon move into this new home. In exchange, the dragon parted with a few of its baubles (all legendary magic items), which the founders traded to establish their company. Of course, such a tale is more or less impossible to verify, but most acquisitions agents agree that, if anyone could have done it, their founders could have.": "经常被引用的DD&D起源的故事涉及到名义上的创始人，现在都（估计）早就死了，帮助一条名叫Garfreckt的永恒之龙把它的囤积物从空间的一个边缘转移到另一个。根据这个故事，创始人为龙发现了一个新的囤积星球，即一个死去的气体巨人的残余核心，现在是一个星球大小的纯钻石球，并帮助龙搬到这个新家。作为交换，龙分出了它的一些小玩意（都是传说中的魔法物品），创始人用这些小玩意换来了他们公司的成立。当然，这样的故事或多或少是无法证实的，但大多数收购代理商都认为，如果有人能做到这一点，他们的创始人可以做到。",
	"At first blush, it can be hard to tell that any part of the Firm's dealings is illicit; after all, its contracts are watertight, its checks never bounce, and its lawyers are impeccable. Those in the know, however, understand that, for all its business accoutrement, the Firm is the largest organized crime syndicate in the 'verse.": "乍一看，很难说该公司的任何交易都是非法的；毕竟，它的合同是无懈可击的，它的支票从不跳票，它的律师也是无可挑剔的。然而，了解情况的人知道，就其所有的商业装备而言，该公司是'se'中最大的有组织犯罪集团。",
	"To conduct its various illegal operations, which include hacking, weapons trafficking, and elaborate heists, the Firm hires short-term Contractors, individuals specially- recruited to match the details of a particular job. Contractors are abundant and varied, including everyone from expert hackers to common thugs, but all are expected to follow their contracts to the letter, regardless of what deeds they entail. Many Contractors even play the part of businessmen with aplomb. By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm's Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.": "为了开展各种非法行动，包括黑客攻击、武器贩运和精心策划的抢劫，公司雇用了短期承包商，这些人是根据特定工作的细节而专门招募的。承包商数量众多，种类繁多，包括从黑客专家到普通暴徒，但所有人都被要求严格遵守合同，无论他们需要做什么工作。许多承包人甚至还潇洒地扮演着商人的角色。就其性质而言，承包商是分门别类的，最终是可以被消耗的；没有一个承包商知道可能会使公司管理层入罪的细节，如果他们成为一个问题，他们的合同可以被终止，通常是通过无保护的太空行走。",
	"Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm's dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm's Middle- Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the 'verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they're also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling's light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.": "由于该公司交易的阴暗性质，关于其管理层的具体细节很难得到。然而，有很多传言说，可以在整个大陆的炉灶上找到该公司的中层管理人员。当然，这意味着，虽然半身人可以提供舒适的床和温暖的食物，但他们也会在一旁非法敛财。半身人的脚步轻盈，毕竟是偷窃的好帮手，如果他们觉得有这种倾向的话。与中间人的大多数公司通信也是利用地精的技术，为秘密会议打开安静的、无法进入的死亡魔法区，同时也阻止了大多数魔法形式的追踪。因此，我们很难确定谁雇用了承包商，谁设计了他们的工作。",
	"A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm's activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone's guess, but seeing as the Firm's reach stretches across the 'verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it's unwise to underestimate their resources.": "一个奇怪的传言说，指导公司活动的小型董事会在一艘名为 \"高层管理 \"的私人战舰上开会。这个传言是否属实谁也不知道，但是看到该公司的触角延伸到了整个'诗篇'，几乎延伸到了电网上的每一个口粮站和世界，低估他们的资源是不明智的。",
	"Not to be confused with Grax's Cheap Guys (a wholly different company), Grax's Guys for Cheap is one of the most prolific mercenary services in the 'verse. Operating at least one bar/inn/business office on every maw on the grid (including those on the outer rim), GGFC is often seen as one of the more stable sources of income a decent, hardworking adventurer can come across, so long as they don't mind the fifteen percent finder's fee (and the smell).": "不要与 \"格雷克斯的廉价伙计\"（完全不同的公司）混淆，\"格雷克斯的廉价伙计 \"是'诗篇'中最多产的雇佣兵服务之一。GGFC在网格上的每一个巨口（包括外缘的巨口）都至少有一个酒吧/酒馆/商务办公室，它通常被视为一个正直、勤奋的冒险者可以遇到的更稳定的收入来源之一，只要他们不介意15%的找人费（和气味）。",
	"Established over fifty years ago, Grax's Guys for Cheap is the lifetime project of Grax Grraxe, an orcish warlord who left the Warzone to escape the constant bloodshed, explosions, and general unpleasantness. Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn't involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the 'verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax's Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.": "Grax's Guys for Cheap成立于50多年前，是Grax Grraxe的毕生事业，他是一个兽人军阀，为了逃避不断发生的流血、爆炸和一般的不愉快而离开战区。他发现在他访问过的任何星球上都无法获得体面的工作（至少是不涉及打人膝盖的工作），格拉克斯搬到了外环，卖掉了他的船，并着手建立一个公司，接受任何人作为赞助人或雇员。今天，在'诗篇'中没有其他雇佣兵服务是如此广泛的。虽然其他人可能有更好的设备，有更好的训练，或乘坐更好的船只，但没有人能够在数量和韧性方面与格拉克斯的人相提并论；此外，格拉克斯提供最好的啤酒。",
	"GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax's Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax's success. Grax's Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a half- up-front deposit. Their tagline \"You can trust Grax!\" can be seen advertised in almost every port in the 'verse.": "GGFC的运作方式与其他大多数雇佣兵公司有些不同。虽然他们并不排斥大多数雇佣兵所期望的保镖任务、保安人员或军事支援，但未来的雇主几乎可以要求Grax的人做任何事情：一个雇佣兵可能会接受一份在银河系中运送罗斯瓦利亚星猪的工作，然后在那些猪的餐厅中充当一个短工厨师。这种广泛的工作岗位一直是格雷克斯成功的基石。格拉克斯的伙计们几乎可以接受任何工作，只要它在大多数银河系地区是合法的，而且报酬可以接受，并预付一半的定金。他们的口号是：\"你可以信任格雷克斯！\"几乎在所有的港口都可以看到广告。",
	"Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy's outcasts. Not to mention the fact that half-orcs are tough and easy to hire.": "自成立以来，格拉克斯一直致力于为被剥夺权利和不被信任的种族的佣兵提供定期合同，特别是混血儿。他在离开战区后试图寻找有报酬的工作的经历使他认识到，银河系的弃儿需要可靠和合法的就业。更不用说半兽人很强悍，很容易被雇用。",
	"For over a hundred years, colonists and homesteaders on the edge of the Galactic Frontier have told legends and tales about the \"White Angel of the Outer Rim.\" When bandits began to overrun their homes, the angel appeared in the sky, ready to mete out justice. When natural disaster threatened their worlds, the angel arrived and ferried them to safety. And when slaughter, death, or capture came from off-world, the angel came to burn their foes with holy fire.": "一百多年来，银河系边疆的殖民者和自耕农一直在讲述关于 \"外环线白衣天使 \"的传说和故事。当强盗开始侵占他们的家园时，天使出现在天空中，准备伸张正义。当自然灾害威胁到他们的世界时，天使到达并把他们送到安全地带。而当屠杀、死亡或捕获来自异世界时，天使就会来用圣火烧毁他们的敌人。",
	"While not a literal guardian angel, the S.S. Saint Vincent might be the closest thing that most folks of the Frontier have to one. The Saint Vincent is a single stark- white human battleship, a Warbringer-class vessel, owned and operated by volunteer peacekeepers and lawmen, seeking to bring order and justice to lawless space. Led by the unflappable Capt. Banoris Starfall, the crew of the Saint Vincent are often the only thing standing in the way of utter chaos on the Frontier.": "虽然不是字面上的守护天使，但圣文森特号可能是边境地区大多数人最接近的东西。圣文森特号是一艘单桅白色的人类战舰，是 \"战神 \"级的船只，由志愿维和人员和执法者拥有和运营，旨在为无法无天的空间带来秩序和正义。在不屈不挠的巴诺里斯-星坠上尉的带领下，圣文森特号的船员往往是唯一能阻止边境地区彻底混乱的人。",
	"The greatest foe that threatens the Saint Vincent is the wrothian menace, which preys upon Frontier worlds with impunity. A constant game of cat and mouse, the Saint Vincent tries to be everywhere at once, patrolling thousands of endangered worlds while probing the Black for the slumbering wrothian ships. Only in rare moments of dramatic confrontation does the Saint Vincent corner and exchange blows with its nemeses, but it is only a matter of time until one side or the other is destroyed.": "威胁圣文森特号的最大敌人是巫师的威胁，它肆无忌惮地掠夺边疆世界。圣文森特号不断地玩着猫捉老鼠的游戏，它试图同时出现在所有地方，在数以千计的濒危世界上巡逻，同时探测黑夜中沉睡的巫师船。只有在罕见的戏剧性对峙时刻，圣文森特才会将其敌人逼到墙角并与之交手，但这只是时间问题，直到一方被摧毁。",
	"The Saint Vincent is named for a cleric of legend who is said to have written the first laws of High Terra, which were passed to him from the gods. These laws listed every conceivable crime, but had no punishments: Saint Vincent's cudgel would be the sole arbiter of all sin. Today, the White Angel of the Outer Rim carries this maverick sense of justice to the far stars, protecting worlds the other factions have never seen and combating threats they have never heard of.": "圣文森特号是以一位传说中的教士命名的，据说他写下了高等泰拉的第一部法律，这些法律是由诸神传给他的。这些法律列出了所有可以想象的罪行，但没有惩罚措施。圣文森特的拐杖将是所有罪行的唯一仲裁者。今天，外环地区的白衣天使将这种特立独行的正义感带到了遥远的星空，保护其他派别从未见过的世界，打击他们闻所未闻的威胁。",
	"Notoriously tough, formidable, and armed to the teeth, Scale and Fang bodyguards cut a menacing figure. In the mercenary world, Scale and Fang Inc. is known for hiring the most powerfully-built bodyguards available (notably many dragonborn) who will dive in front of a blaster bolt at a moment's notice for their charge. These bodyguards are the finest in the 'verse, specializing in escorting high- class clientele through dangerous areas. In fact, it's rare to see a Hegemony governor or an elven aristocrat walking the maws without a posse of Scale and Fang dragonborn. Though clients should expect to pay handsomely for the protection service, they can rest easy knowing that Scale and Fang are watching over them.": "鳞片和獠牙公司的保镖出了名的强悍、可怕，而且武装到了牙齿，他们的形象气势如虹。在雇佣兵世界里，\"天秤座 \"公司以雇佣最强壮的保镖而闻名（尤其是许多龙裔），他们会在接到通知的一刹那为他们的负责人跳到爆破弹面前。这些保镖是这个世界上最好的，专门护送高级客户通过危险区域。事实上，很少看到霸权主义的总督或精灵族的贵族在没有鳞片和獠牙龙裔的陪伴下在大口中行走。虽然客户应该期望为保护服务支付高昂的费用，但他们可以放心，因为他们知道天平和方在看着他们。",
	"Headquartered in a planetoid made of pure diamond near Draxel, Scale and Fang is funded largely by the eternal dragon, Garfreckt. Purportedly, Garfreckt founded the company when he lost a bet with an elven adventurer and promised away his small army of dragonborn minions to help complete the elf's quest. When the dragonborn returned, they were accompanied by a half-dozen others, each wishing to inquire how to enlist the dragonborn for their own services. Because of the dragonborn's expertise in protecting their master and his hoard, their skills were tailor-made to keeping watch over others, and thus Scale and Fang was born.": "鳞片和獠牙公司的总部设在德拉塞尔附近的一个由纯钻石制成的行星上，其资金主要来自永恒之龙加弗雷克特。据称，加弗莱克特在与一位精灵冒险家打赌输掉后成立了这家公司，并承诺送走他的小型龙裔爪牙军队以帮助完成精灵的任务。当龙裔回来时，他们身边还有半打人，每个人都希望询问如何争取龙裔为自己服务。由于龙裔在保护他们的主人和他的囤积物方面的专长，他们的技能是为监视他人而量身定做的，因此，\"鳞甲与方 \"诞生了。",
	"While most religions are strictly tied to the planets from which their gods originate, there is at least one church gaining a foothold throughout the 'verse. The Temple of the Chosen venerates a diverse pantheon of spacefarers, who each, it is said, ascended from their mortal forms and attained godhood, granting them dominion over the entire galaxy. This pantheon, known as the Chosen, contains no names, only titles corresponding to their god's position aboard their celestial spacecraft, the Ark:": "虽然大多数宗教都与他们的神的来源星球严格挂钩，但至少有一个教会在整个 \"诗篇 \"中获得了立足之地。天选者神庙崇敬一个由太空人组成的不同万神殿，据说他们每个人都从凡人的形式中升华并获得神性，赋予他们对整个星系的统治权。这个被称为 \"神选者 \"的万神殿没有名字，只有与他们的神在天体飞船 \"方舟 \"上的位置相对应的称号。",

	"It is difficult, however, to parse religion in absolutes. Some people believe the Chosen and their Ark are merely a metaphor, a guideline by which to live a more perfect life. Others, however, believe the Chosen to be real, immortal beings traveling the universe in an omnipotent ship. Historians, meanwhile, suggest that the story of the Chosen and the Ark might be loosely derived from some ancient tale of a real ship that underwent a fateful journey past the edge of the galaxy and never returned.": "然而，很难用绝对的方式来解析宗教。有些人认为神选者和他们的方舟只是一种隐喻，是一种准则，据此可以过一种更完美的生活。然而，其他人则认为神选者是真实的、不朽的生命，他们乘坐一艘无所不能的船在宇宙中旅行。同时，历史学家认为，神选者和方舟的故事可能松散地来自于一些古老的故事，即一艘真正的飞船经历了一次宿命的旅行，经过银河系的边缘后再也没有回来。",
	"Whatever the truth is, the Temple adheres strictly to the belief that the Chosen are divinity, whose celestial ship grants them dominion over all worlds in the 'verse.

It traces its origins back to Terminus the First, the same mage (now lich) who established the Hegemony of Man and expanded its boundaries. Terminus ostensibly founded the Tower as a fraternal order to unite arcanists from across the stars, but its clandestine nature makes its true intentions hard to discern. The Tower's inner-sanctums are closed to those who do not undergo their esoteric induction rituals, its agents speak in coded language, and the highest echelons of its memberships share profound secrets unknown to all others, including lower-ranking Tower agents.": "塔的确是一个奥术师的秘密社团，充斥着神秘的密码和深奥的仪式。它的起源可以追溯到第一代Terminus，也就是建立人类霸权并扩大其边界的法师（现在的巫师）。表面上看，特米努斯建立的塔是一个兄弟会，以团结来自整个星际的奥术师，但它的秘密性质使得它的真实意图难以辨别。塔的内部圣殿对那些没有经过其神秘的入会仪式的人是封闭的，它的代理人用编码语言说话，其成员的最高层分享着不为人知的深层秘密，包括低级别的塔代理人。",

	"Perhaps the Tower is truly a conspiratorial network of powerful arcanists with a grand agenda, or perhaps, for all its trappings, it's more like an arcane boy's club, trading secrets and restricting membership to the select few. It's even possible that the Tower sees itself as acting in the galaxy's interest by securing powerful artifacts and spells before they can fall into the wrong hands. What is certainly true is that the Tower's agents are as numerous as they are undetectable, that its libraries contain forbidden arcane knowledge, and that only a few know its true intentions.": "也许通天塔真的是一个由强大的奥术师组成的阴谋网络，有着宏伟的计划，或者说，就其所有的外衣而言，它更像是一个奥术男孩的俱乐部，交易秘密并限制少数人加入。甚至有可能塔认为自己是为了银河系的利益而行动，在强大的神器和法术落入坏人之手之前确保它们。可以肯定的是，通天塔的特工人数众多，而且不容易被发现，它的图书馆里有禁忌的奥术知识，而且只有少数人知道它的真实意图。",

I have spent my life studying the holy texts, meditating on their hidden meanings. In doing so, however, I have learned some things that the cult of the Sun Above would rather stayed hidden. Their doctrine is founded on lies, and that, I cannot abide. Thus, I have dedicated the rest of my days to spreading the truth across the galaxy.\"": "\"那是一个很长的故事，\"他说，\"但我已经知道你的一切，所以我至少要给你一个简短的版本，这才公平。那就是这样。我是一个普通的和尚。我一生都在研究圣典，冥思苦想它们隐藏的含义。然而，在这样做的过程中，我学到了一些太阳神的崇拜者宁愿隐藏起来的东西。他们的教义是建立在谎言之上的，而这是我不能容忍的。因此，我把余下的日子献给了在整个银河系传播真理。\"",
	"The implication was obvious. \"So, you're a nonbeliever. A heretic.\"": "其含义是显而易见的。\"所以，你是一个不信教的人。一个异教徒。\"",
	"\"In the eyes of the High Priests, yes. They are hunting me and my brethren, which is why I need that legendary weapon. Naturally, any other treasures in the dragon's hoard would be yours to keep.

	"The hundred million stars in our galaxy play host to a menagerie of intelligent life, wondrous creatures both great and small. Arguably, the most prominent of these creatures are those that discovered Dark Matter technology early and used it to garner some territory of their own on the galactic stage, naming planets and forging great fleets to defend their space. There are thousands of intelligent races yet to be discovered, a variety that includes every campaign setting ever made.": "我们银河系中的一亿颗恒星孕育了大量的智慧生命，这些奇妙的生物有大有小。可以说，这些生物中最突出的是那些很早就发现了暗物质技术，并利用它在银河系的舞台上获得了一些自己的领地，为行星命名并组建了强大的舰队来保卫自己的空间。有数以千计的智能种族尚未被发现，其种类包括有史以来的每一个活动设置。",

But, indeed, there are some races that are completely original to the Dark Matter setting; races that have shaped the history of the galaxy, and make excellent additions to parties of explorers, adventurers, and traders. This chapter contains six new races, and a new subrace for humans.": "黑暗物质的设定可以包含任何你在典型的角色扮演游戏中会发现的种族：精灵、兽人和矮人，当然还有其他许多种族。甚至来自地球的人类也可以在黑暗物质中找到，如果可以提供一些手段将他们从太阳周围的死亡魔法区拉出来的话。但是，确实有一些种族是黑暗物质设定中完全原创的；这些种族塑造了银河系的历史，并成为探险家、冒险家和商人队伍中的优秀补充。本章包含六个新种族，以及一个新的人类亚种族。",

These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly well- educated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.": "在系统和逻辑的诱惑下，一个疯狂的古怪群体拥抱了科学。这些不同的工匠、学生和发明家往往在科学、奥秘和工程原理方面受到一致的良好教育（或至少是高度自学），特别注重实际应用。尽管大多数小工匠至少对宇宙的潜在奥秘感到好奇，但许多人认为突破性的科学发现是达到目的的手段；理论的存在只是为了促进应用。",
	"Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace.

All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.": "在突破和科学进步的推动下，小发明家们推动着科学和创新的前沿，以惊人的速度设计出新的技术奇迹（或至少是新的爆破器变种）。一些小发明家专注于某个特定的问题，单独为其创新和优化解决方案，而其他人则在任何可以找到应用的地方设计技术奇迹。现代世界的所有伟大进步，从数据板到暗物质引擎，都是由小发明家带头实现的。",
	"A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.": "一个小发明家很少被看到远离漂浮的全息球体，那是他们的人工智能（AI）伴侣。毕竟，一个有机体的大脑只能容纳这么多的信息，而人工智能可以轻松地回忆方程式，追踪原理图，并进行计算。当然，如果没有小发明家的聪明才智，这样的智力是微不足道的，但人工智能的眼睛仍然可以发现他们的创造者可能没有注意到的错误。",
	"But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.": "但不仅如此，人工智能伴侣也是一个不知疲倦的朋友。一个小发明家无休止的工作往往可能是单调和孤立的，但人工智能在一个人耳边不断发出的友好声音，对防止疯狂科学家和末日设备有很大帮助。",
	"When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?": "在设计你的小发明家时，考虑是什么吸引了你的角色去研究科学。是解决一个新难题的挑战，还是完善一个新发明的刺激？也许你的角色痴迷于宇宙的某个特定方面，并渴望揭开其神秘面纱。想想你是如何了解科学和工程的。你是否有一个塑造你的理解的导师，或者你完全是自学成才？",
	"Also, consider which Prototype you'll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit?

	"More so than almost any other class, the gadgeteer is uniquely focused on science and engineering, which might not fit cohesively with all campaign settings. If used in a setting outside of Dark Matter, it might be useful to translate the class into more familiar terms: rather than 'Gadgets,' the gadgeteer uses 'Magic Items,' rather than an 'AI Companion,' they have a 'Sentient Magic Item,' and rather than a 'Prototype,' they have a 'Relic', and so on. The mechanics of most of these devices need not be changed, for technology in Dark Matter is also generally powered by magic.": "比起其他几乎所有的等级，\"小发明家 \"独特地专注于科学和工程，这可能并不适合所有的竞选环境。如果在黑暗物质之外的环境中使用，把这个等级翻译成更熟悉的术语可能是有用的：与其说是 \"小玩意\"，不如说是 \"魔法物品\"，与其说是 \"人工智能伴侣\"，不如说是 \"有生命的魔法物品\"，与其说是 \"原型\"，不如说是 \"遗物\"，等等。大多数这些设备的机制不需要改变，因为黑暗物质中的技术一般也是由魔法驱动的。",
	"Blasters, on the other hand, are fairly unique to Dark Matter. The bonus damage offered by Overcharge can be applied to ranged attacks from crossbows or cantrips, as appropriate to the setting.": "另一方面，爆破手在黑暗物质中是相当独特的。过度充电提供的额外伤害可以应用于十字弓或咒语的远程攻击，这与设定相适应。",

	"For some characters and campaigns, a fun alternative might be to present the gadgeteer as a time-traveler or a stranded visitor from outer space, equipped with high technology. This angle works best with a heavy dose of humor and satire, contrasting a conventional fantasy setting with a sci-fi outsider.": "对于某些角色和活动来说，一个有趣的替代方案可能是将小发明家表现为一个时间旅行者或来自外太空的滞留者，配备了高科技。这个角度的作品最好带有浓厚的幽默和讽刺意味，将传统的幻想背景与科幻的外来者形成对比。",
	"Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level.

	"Oh no, it will be very difficult,\" replied the vect. \"There are rumors going around about warheads being smuggled through the Miaam-Osk Pathway, but they're sure to be heavily guarded.\"": "哦，不，这将是非常困难的，\"vect回答说。\"有传言说弹头通过米亚姆-奥斯克通道被偷运，但它们肯定会被严密看管。\"",
	"Rami did some quick calculations. \"I like the plan, but that's five maw jumps away. Ain't gonna be many people going that way on legitimate business either. I reckon we're gonna need to grab a ship of our own while we're here... You know how to hotwire a Dark Matter drive, right, Nano?\"": "拉米做了一些快速计算。\"我喜欢这个计划，但那是五次跳跃的距离。也不会有很多人为了合法的生意去那里。我估计我们在这里的时候需要抓住一艘我们自己的船......。你知道如何启动暗物质驱动装置，对吗，纳诺？\"",
	"After a brief period of rummaging, the gadgeteer produced a small object, bristling with probes, cables, and various other protrusions. \"Certainly. If this thing still works.\" Nano pressed a switch, reconnected a few loose plugs, thought for a moment, then ripped out a fat cylindrical component. Lights started blinking all over the device. \"There we go.\"": "在短暂的翻找之后，这个小发明家拿出一个小东西，上面布满了探头、电缆和其他各种突起物。\"当然可以。如果这东西还能用的话。\" 纳诺按了一个开关，重新连接了几个松动的插头，想了一会儿，然后扯出了一个肥大的圆柱形部件。灯光开始在设备上四处闪烁。\"我们走吧。\"",

	"The door led to a lift, which was precisely as fast as the vect said. However, Nano failed to mention the gut-wrenching g-forces as the lift rocketed to the docks above. Rami and Mekhet- Nu stumbled out slowly, trying to maintain composure and avoid throwing up. Nano, oblivious, stalked forward into a cavernous hangar, in which dozens of ships were parked, no two the same.": "这扇门通向一部电梯，电梯的速度恰好和vect说的一样快。然而，纳诺没有提到电梯飞到上面的码头时令人心惊肉跳的重力作用。拉米和梅克特-努慢慢地走了出来，试图保持镇定，避免呕吐。纳诺无动于衷，径直走向一个空旷的机库，里面停放着几十艘飞船，没有两艘是相同的。",

	"Thus they proceeded, with Nano offering apologies to anyone whose paths they crossed, assuring them that the lights would be fixed as soon as possible.": "因此，他们继续前进，纳诺向任何与他们擦肩而过的人表示歉意，并向他们保证会尽快修好这些灯。",
	"In the first bay was a sleek elven Interceptor, its pulse cannon half-disassembled, while an aristocratic elf—presumably the ship's owner—remonstrated with a pair of technicians.

	"The many worlds of Dark Matter are filled with characters great and small, from the gnomish mechanics that keep the Flotilla aloft, to righteous avia-ra pilgrims proselytizing on backwater worlds, to the intrepid human explorers mapping the far reaches of the galaxy. It is from the perspectives of these outstanding characters that players will discover Dark Matter, tease out its secrets, brave its dangers, and become its staunch protectors, or perhaps, its sinister villains. This chapter contains new options for characters in Dark Matter and other science fiction settings, beginning with a brief introduction on creating new characters in this setting. After that is a section containing new subclasses, both for traditional classes, as well as those written by Mage Hand Press. Next, the chapter contains a list of unique backgrounds, which can help characters of any class root their skills and histories in the Dark Matter universe. Following backgrounds is a list of feats, which are optional character options that represent a character's expertise or exceptionality. Finally, the end of this chapter discusses skills, highlighting new uses for conventional skills and introducing new skills, which expand a character's options in a high-tech science fiction world.": "在《黑暗物质》的众多世界中，充满了大大小小的角色，从维持船队航行的地精机械师，到在偏远世界传教的正义的阿维亚拉朝圣者，再到绘制银河系远方地图的无畏的人类探险家。正是从这些杰出人物的角度，玩家将发现黑暗物质，揭开它的秘密，勇敢面对它的危险，并成为它坚定的保护者，或者也许是它邪恶的反派。本章包含了《黑暗物质》和其他科幻设定中的角色的新选项，首先是关于在此设定中创建新角色的简要介绍。之后是一个包含新的子类的章节，既有传统的类，也有法师之手出版社编写的类。接下来，本章包含一个独特的背景列表，它可以帮助任何等级的角色在黑暗物质宇宙中扎根他们的技能和历史。在背景之后是一个功勋列表，它是代表人物专长或特殊性的可选角色选项。最后，本章末尾讨论了技能，强调了传统技能的新用途，并介绍了新技能，这些技能扩大了角色在高科技科幻世界中的选择。",
	"As a rule, if it belongs in an RPG world, it belongs in Dark Matter.": "作为一项规则，如果它属于RPG世界，它就属于《黑暗物质》。",
	"Every class, every race, and every character option lives in Dark Matter; not just in faraway corners of the universe, but in the forefront. Armor-clad knights, gun- toting cyborgs, and lone outlaws line Dark Matter's cast, a menagerie of characters from all across space and time. Not only does this mean that all the character options from the SRD are at your disposal when making a character, but so is but basically anything else you can think of.": "在《黑暗物质》中，每一个阶级、每一个种族和每一个角色选项都存在；不仅仅是在宇宙的遥远角落，而是在最前线。穿着盔甲的骑士、拿着枪的机械人和孤独的亡命之徒在《黑暗物质》的演员阵容中占了一席之地，这些角色来自各个空间和时间。这不仅意味着在制作角色时，SRD中所有的角色选项都在你的掌握之中，而且基本上你能想到的其他东西也都在其中。",
	"Even though this setting introduces new races and takes time to reinterpret classic fantasy races—elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc.—every other race is also on the table, from tieflings and dragonborn to literal angels and demons. The same goes for class options: this chapter contains a plethora of science fiction variants, which are collectively intended to stand alongside the fantasy perspective of the core rules. Pick a character that speaks to you and build it how you want.": "尽管这个设定引入了新的种族，并花时间重新诠释了经典的幻想种族--精灵、矮人、地精等等--其他所有的种族也都在桌面上，从铁皮人和龙裔到字面上的天使和恶魔。阶级选择也是如此：本章包含了大量的科幻小说变体，它们共同的目的是与核心规则的幻想视角并驾齐驱。挑选一个能让你心动的角色，并按照你的意愿来构建它。",
	"Once you've selected your race and class (and optionally, background, subclass, and feats), it's time to dive into the equipment and skills offered by Dark Matter. The following tables outline your new proficiencies, as well as starting equipment and how best to approach a beginner starship.": "一旦你选择了你的种族和阶级（以及可选的背景、子阶级和特技），就该深入研究《暗物质》提供的装备和技能了。下面的表格概述了你的新技能，以及起始装备和如何最好地接近初级星舰。",
	"Characters of every stripe, from medieval knights, to pirate captains, to Old West gunslingers have a place in Dark Matter. Feel free to use the options presented in this chapter, but don't feel that you should be limited by them. Characters can use any content from Fifth Edition in this setting.": "各种类型的角色，从中世纪的骑士，到海盗船长，再到旧西部的枪手，在《黑暗物质》中都有一席之地。你可以自由地使用本章所介绍的选项，但不要觉得你应该被它们所限制。角色可以在这个设定中使用第五版的任何内容。",

	"The starting equipment from your class generally includes relevant weapons and armor, as well as an assortment of useful adventuring gear, collected in a pack. However, the equipment and packs that come with most classes might seem ill-suited to the demands of traveling through space or exploring an alien planet. Therefore, when you create your character, you can modify your starting equipment by following these guidelines:": "你的等级的起始装备一般包括相关的武器和盔甲，以及各种有用的冒险装备，收集在一个背包里。然而，大多数等级的装备和背包可能看起来不适合在太空中旅行或探索外星的要求。因此，当你创建你的角色时，你可以按照这些准则来修改你的起始装备。",
	"If your class offers a simple or martial melee weapon, you can choose any weapon of the same type (simple or martial) from this book.

	"If your class offers a specific simple ranged weapon and ammunition, such as the light crossbow with bolts or shortbow with arrows, you can instead choose any simple blaster you have proficiency with. If your class offers a specific martial ranged weapon with ammunition, such as a longbow and arrows, you can instead choose any martial blaster you have proficiency with.": "如果你的等级提供了特定的简单远程武器和弹药，例如带箭的轻弩或带箭的短弓，你可以选择任何你熟练掌握的简单爆破器。如果你的等级提供特定的武术远程武器和弹药，比如长弓和箭，你可以选择任何你熟练掌握的武术爆破器。",
	"You can replace any pack you get from your class with one of the following packs, or you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.": "你可以用下面的一个包来代替你从班上得到的任何一个包，或者你可以以所示价格购买一个包，这可能比单独购买物品更便宜。",
	"Because Dark Matter equipment can be more expensive than adventuring equipment in a low-tech campaign setting, with GM permission, you can double the number of gold pieces offered by your class and background.": "因为在低技术含量的战役环境中，暗物质装备可能比冒险装备更昂贵，所以在GM的允许下，你可以将你的等级和背景所提供的金币数量翻倍。",
	"Any character that gains a fighting style can choose from these, in addition to the fighting styles offered by their class:": "任何获得战斗风格的角色都可以从这些风格中选择，除了他们的等级所提供的战斗风格之外。",
	"Nearly every band of explorers, spacers, and mercenaries needs a reliable ship to jetset around the universe. Plenty of smaller-scale games might focus on a single planet, or even a single space station, but for those which explore the breadth of the 'verse, a starting ship is unquestionably key. Sadly, even the most modest ships are unaffordable with the starting gold of any class, so it falls on the GM to decide which ship the party gets access to and how they acquire it.": "几乎所有的探险家、太空人和雇佣兵都需要一艘可靠的飞船在宇宙中飞翔。很多小规模的游戏可能只关注一个星球，甚至是一个空间站，但对于那些探索宇宙广度的游戏来说，一艘初始飞船无疑是关键。可悲的是，即使是最普通的飞船也是任何等级的起始金币都买不起的，所以GM要决定玩家可以获得哪艘飞船，以及他们如何获得它。",
	"As a guideline, parties of 1st to 4th level should get a Personal class ship, parties of 5th to 10th level should get a Transport class ship, and parties of 11th level or higher should get a Corvette class ship. Campaigns with an emphasis on ship combat can eschew these guidelines.": "作为一个准则，1-4级的队伍应该得到一艘个人级飞船，5-10级的队伍应该得到一艘运输级飞船，而11级以上的队伍应该得到一艘护卫级飞船。强调舰艇战斗的战役可以不考虑这些准则。",
	"The GM can choose to bequeath the party a ship on behalf of their employers, either a wealthy benefactor or a faction. Doing this is a surefire way of grounding the party in the world and giving them a launching point for adventures, but also ties them to certain obligations.": "GM可以选择代表他们的雇主，无论是一个富有的恩人还是一个派别，将一艘船遗赠给他们。这样做是使党派立足于这个世界并给他们一个冒险的出发点的可靠方法，但也将他们与某些义务联系在一起。",
	"Another option is for the GM to set a budget, say 10,000 gp, which the party can spend on any ship of Personal or Transport class, as well as their choice of upgrades. This approach is preferable if the party will spend a long time in their ship, whether in space combat or on a long voyage to the Frontier.": "另一个选择是由GM设定一个预算，比如说10,000gp，当事人可以用它来购买任何个人或运输类的飞船，以及他们选择的升级。如果党派将在他们的飞船中花费很长的时间，无论是在太空战斗中还是在前往边境的长途旅行中，这种方法是可取的。",
	"Rarely is a character just a fighter, a rogue, or a cleric; fighters might be gritty space marines, trained in stomping alien space-bugs, rogues might be sophisticated infiltrators, using teleportation and hacking to gain access o encrypted systems, and clerics might be worshipers of the Sun Above, or heretics that worship the all-consuming Void. Whatever the class, a character's subclass imbues it with the detail and expression to make it truly unique.": "一个角色很少只是一个战士、一个流氓或一个牧师；战士可能是狡猾的太空海军陆战队员，接受过踩死外星太空虫子的训练；流氓可能是复杂的潜入者，使用传送和黑客技术进入加密系统；而牧师可能是太阳的崇拜者，或者是崇拜虚空的异教徒。不管是什么类别，一个角色的子类都会赋予其细节和表现力，使其真正的独一无二。",
	"This section contains new subclasses, character-defining choices which are taken at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass helps further narrow the scope of a base class into a specific character archetype by providing features that change the class's playstyle, while grounding it in the world. For example, a Circle of Configuration druid will play very differently than a Circle of the Land druid, nd both paint wildly different pictures of their respective characters.": "本节包含了新的子类，即在1、2、3级时进行的角色定义选择。子类有助于进一步缩小基础类的范围，使其成为一个特定的角色原型，提供改变该类玩法的特征，同时使其在世界中立足。例如，\"配置之环 \"德鲁伊和 \"土地之环 \"德鲁伊的玩法截然不同，两者对各自角色的描绘也大不相同。",
	"In addition to subclasses for classes provided in the SRD, like the Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard, this chapter also has archetypes for Mage Hand Press classes, such as the Alchemist, Craftsman, and Warmage. Characters in Dark Matter campaigns need not pick from among these new subclass options or even play as one of the classes represented here, for characters of every stripe can be encountered in the 'verse; these offerings merely tantalize new, science fiction twists on familiar characters": "除了SRD中提供的类的子类，如战士、游侠和巫师，本章还提供了法师手压类的原型，如炼金术士、工匠和暖气师。黑暗物质战役中的角色不需要从这些新的子类选项中挑选，甚至不需要扮演这里所代表的某个类，因为各种类型的角色都可以在'诗篇'中遇到；这些产品只是对熟悉的角色进行了新的、科幻式的扭曲。",

	"Research into the very nature of the elements has evolved from the erstwhile search for transmutation into gold to an involved magical and scientific field. The four elements can interact in deviously clever ways, especially when unusual states of matter such as plasma are utilized, such that many of the field's core principles could change with only a few major breakthroughs.

Even as the aeons have marched forward and warfare has grown from swords and spears to interplanetary affairs of starships and warheads, barbarians have not budged; they are still an embodiment of primal,furious rage. Some barbarians focus their rage through circuitry and steel, becoming the brutal warlords of a new age, but others shun this new technology, smashing any that comes within arm's reach.": "野蛮人的定义是居住在他们体内的肆无忌惮的愤怒。即使时代在前进，战争从刀枪剑戟发展到星际间的星舰和弹头，野蛮人也没有动摇；他们仍然是原始、愤怒的化身。一些野蛮人通过电路和钢铁来集中他们的愤怒，成为新时代的残酷军阀，但其他野蛮人则回避这种新技术，粉碎任何近在咫尺的东西。",
	"Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.": "愤怒在每个野蛮人的心中燃烧，是驱使他或她走向伟大的熔炉。然而，不同的野蛮人将他们的愤怒归于不同的来源。对一些人来说，它是一个内部的水库，痛苦、悲伤和愤怒在这里被锻造成像钢铁一样坚硬的怒火。其他人则把它看作是一种精神上的祝福，一种图腾动物的礼物。",
	"Bards are consummate performers and entertainers, and often find that their skills have unexpected and widereaching applications across the 'verse. Any bard can play for the guests of a halfling hearthstation, but many bards can also find work as translators, ambassadors, salesmen, spies, and historians. Bards are experts at putting a smiling face on an enterprise and a skilled hand to its operation, which keeps their talents in demand no matter where they travel.": "吟游诗人是完美的表演者和艺人，并且经常发现他们的技能在整个 \"诗篇 \"中有意想不到的广泛用途。任何吟游诗人都可以为半身人炉台的客人演奏，但许多吟游诗人也可以找到翻译、大使、推销员、间谍和历史学家的工作。吟游诗人是为企业增添笑脸的专家，也是企业运营的能手，这使他们的才能无论在哪里都很受欢迎。",
	"The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.": "吟游诗人的方式是好客的。吟游诗人相互寻找，交换歌曲和故事，夸耀他们的成就，并分享他们的知识。吟游诗人组成松散的协会，他们称之为学院，以促进他们的聚会并保护他们的传统。",
	"Masters of sword and spell alike, channelers draw their power from the planes of the multiverse, focusing this energy like a lens to produce magical effects. Channelers have explored the breadth of the 'verse, along with the infinitely more expansive multiverse, in pursuit of their goals, which often include securing nuggets of arcane knowledge or lesser-known artifacts. Their networks of allies, called Planar Orders, extend across the 'verse and might prove invaluable to explorers and adventures lost among the stars, especially to those searching its recesses for similar objectives.": "剑术和法术的大师，引导者从多元宇宙的层面上汲取他们的力量，像透镜一样聚焦这种能量以产生神奇的效果。传导者为了追求他们的目标，已经探索了整个宇宙的广度，以及无限广阔的多元宇宙，其中通常包括确保奥术知识的金块或鲜为人知的神器。他们的盟友网络被称为 \"星球骑士团\"，遍布整个宇宙，可能会被证明对探险家和迷失在星空中的冒险家是非常有价值的，特别是对那些为了类似目标而在星空中搜索的人。",
	"A channeler's first steps into the multiverse are daunting: the infinite planes of existence are treacherous and do not yield their secrets easily.

	"The gods of the 'verse are many and varied. Practically every inhabited world bears its own pantheon of unique deities, each of which are capable of bestowing their believers with true miracles—feats of divine magic. Therefore, faith is an important resource on the galactic stage, as many rival pantheons compete for adherents.

	"In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity's domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity's portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain. Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (\"radiant\") Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (\"healing\"), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.": "在一个万神殿中，每个神灵都对凡人生活和文明的不同方面有影响，称为神灵的领域。一个神灵对其具有影响力的所有领域被称为神灵的组合。例如，希腊的阿波罗神的组合包括知识、生命和光等领域。作为一个牧师，你选择你的神的组合中的一个方面来强调，你被授予与该领域有关的力量。你的选择可能与致力于你的神灵的特定教派相对应。例如，阿波罗在一个地区被崇拜为Phoebus（\"光芒四射\"）的阿波罗，强调他对光明领域的影响，而在另一个地方被崇拜为Apollo Acesius（\"治疗\"），强调他与生命领域的联系。另外，你对领域的选择可能仅仅是一个个人偏好的问题，是神灵最吸引你的方面。",
	"The builders of fleets and founders of cities, craftsmen throughout the 'verse are highly sought out for their technical expertise and mechanical know-how. Nearly every large ship in the verse counts at least one craftsman among their number, and likely many more. The proliferation of new technology, both the magical, like {@filter blasters|items|property=blaster} and {@item Dark Matter Engines|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines}, and the nonmagical variety, like the great gnomish ships, has led to a swathe of new discoveries and innovations made by notable craftsman.

	"All master craftsmen individually learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under tutelage of another master artisan. However, as they hone their skills, they invariably find themselves drawn to gatherings of other like-minded craftsmen. These groups, formalized as Guilds, provide a means for craftsmen to compare notes and schematics, acquire resources, and provide a means for craftsmen to ply their trade.": "所有的工匠大师都各自学习铁匠、皮革加工、木工和其他通往大师之路的必要学科的基础知识，要么自己学习，要么在其他工匠大师的指导下学习。然而，当他们磨练自己的技能时，他们总是发现自己被其他志同道合的工匠们所吸引。这些团体被正式命名为行会，为工匠们提供了一个比较笔记和图纸、获取资源的途径，并为工匠们提供了一个从事其行业的手段。",
	"Most craftsmen do their best work in precisely arranged workshops, with exact components, plenty of tools and space, and all the best materials.

	"Strange, alien worlds are watched over by strange, alien druids. A druid's magic is an embodiment of the natural world; however, in the vastness of space, 'natural' usually means something completely unrecognizable to one's home planet.

	"Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.

	"When most everyone in the 'verse carries a blaster, it can be hard to distinguish the true gunslingers from the pretenders. Real gunslingers draw first, aim true, and know where their shots will land before they pull the trigger; most of them even look good while doing it.

Bottom line: you don't want to be staring at the business end of a gunslinger's blaster; you probably won't see much after.": "当这个世界上的大多数人都带着爆破枪时，就很难区分真正的枪手和伪装者了。真正的枪手首先拔枪，瞄准，在扣动扳机之前就知道他们的子弹会落在哪里；他们中的大多数人甚至在扣动扳机的时候还很好看。他们不依靠技巧或盟友来赢得胜利；他们只需要一个可靠的爆破器和自己的勇气。一句话：你不会想盯着枪手的爆裂枪头看的；你可能不会看到什么。",

An overheated weapon can't be fired again until the end of your next turn.": "同样在3级时，当你在你的回合中使用不具有过热属性的爆破枪进行{@action Attack}行动时，你可以使用你的额外行动来给它过电。每当你在攻击行动中用这把爆裂枪的攻击击中一个生物，你可以对该生物造成一个额外的模子伤害。然而之后，你的武器就会过热，在你的下一个回合结束之前，你不能再使用这个功能。过热的武器在你下一回合结束前不能再次发射。",
	"At 7th level, you can customize your blaster to better suit the rugged lifestyle of a frontiersman. If you spend a short rest working on a blaster, you can modify it such that its normal and long ranges are doubled, it functions normally in adverse weather conditions, it can be fired normally underwater, and it can be used as a melee weapon with the statistics of a mace. You can only have one blaster modified in this way at any given time, and only you are able to use this weapon proficiently.": "在7级时，你可以定制你的冲击波，以更好地适应边疆人的粗犷生活。如果你花短暂的休息时间在爆破枪上，你可以修改它，使它的普通和远距离射程增加一倍，在恶劣的天气条件下正常工作，在水下可以正常发射，并且可以作为近战武器使用，统计学上是一个大锤。你在任何时候都只能有一个以这种方式改装的冲击波，而且只有你能熟练地使用这种武器。",

In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks you make to interact with aberrations.": "到了10级，各种外星人的奇怪战斗方式不再让你感到惊讶。你在对抗由异形、怪兽、或渗出物造成的影响时有优势。此外，你在与反常者互动的魅力检查中也有优势。",
	"When you reach 14th level, you master the art of fighting in deep space, fitting jet thrusters to your gear in order to gain extra maneuverability.

	"Though there are innumerable monasteries scattered throughout the 'verse, both on established worlds and on secluded asteroids far from them, monks can eschew traditional training and instead take guidance from other avenues. Some monks learn to fight on the streets of elven megacities, adopting balance and focusing their ki as a means of survival. Others learn to manipulate their ki from seclusion on long interstellar voyages; on such journeys, there is little occupation apart from introspection. And some monks learn martial arts from military organizations, such as the Lakshay defense force, and carry their skills forward to find a higher purpose. No matter how a monk learns to fight and manipulate their ki, they all achieve profound spiritual balance.": "虽然有无数的寺院散布在整个'诗篇'中，无论是在成熟的世界还是在远离它们的僻静的小行星上，僧侣们可以放弃传统的训练，而从其他途径获得指导。一些僧侣在精灵族大城市的街道上学习战斗，采用平衡和集中他们的气力作为生存的手段。其他人则在漫长的星际航行中从隐居中学习操纵他们的气；在这样的旅程中，除了反省，几乎没有什么职业。还有一些僧侣从军事组织中学习武术，如拉克西防御部队，并将他们的技能发扬光大，以寻找更高的目标。无论僧侣如何学习战斗和操纵他们的气力，他们都能达到深刻的精神平衡。",
	"A handful of monastic traditions are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the many traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.": "在散布于多元宇宙的寺院中，少数寺院传统是常见的。大多数寺院只练习一种传统，但也有少数寺院尊重许多传统，并根据每个僧侣的能力和兴趣来指导他们。所有的传统都依赖于相同的基本技术，随着学生的成长和熟练程度的提高而有所区别。因此，僧侣只有在达到第三级时才需要选择一个传统。",
	"The monk feature Deflect Missiles assumes that all ranged weapons use a missle of some variety. By extension, in Dark Matter, monks can deflect and redirect ranged attacks from blasters as if they were missiles.": "僧侣的特点是，所有远程武器都使用某种类型的导弹。推而广之，在《黑暗物质》中，僧侣可以偏转和重定向来自爆破手的远程攻击，就像它们是导弹一样。",
	"A sacred oath is binding, no matter how far a paladin travels. Even a million light years from home, on the frontier of an alien world, their oaths still propel them forward and guide their hands. Such is the strength of a paladin's devotion.": "一个神圣的誓言是有约束力的，无论一个圣骑士走多远。即使是在离家一百万光年的地方，在一个异世界的边疆，他们的誓言仍然推动他们前进，指导他们的行动。这就是圣骑士的奉献精神的力量。",
	"Clad in gleaming power armor and wielding blinding laser swords, paladins are known to uphold justice throughout the 'verse. It is no accident, therefore, that a knightly order of paladins, the Order of the Sepulcher, watches over the maws and the Solar Citadel, ensuring that peace remains. Only the rigorous tenets of a paladin's vows could be trusted with something of such magnitude; were it any other group watching over these places, the 'verse likely would have descended into another great war, perhaps a second Night Crusade, centuries ago.": "穿着闪亮的动力装甲，挥舞着耀眼的激光剑，圣骑士们在整个 \"诗篇 \"中以维护正义而闻名。因此，由圣骑士组成的骑士团--墓穴骑士团，守护着大嘴和太阳城，确保和平的存在，这并非偶然。只有严格的圣骑士誓言才可以被信任来处理如此重大的事情；如果是其他团体在看守这些地方，'诗篇很可能在几个世纪前就会陷入另一场大战争，也许是第二次夜色十字军。",
	"Apart from their orders, lone paladins pursue their righteous quests across the galaxy, often falling in line with other, less holy adventurers. Among these crews, paladins are differentiated by their unwavering honor and loyalty, as well as their penchant for protecting the innocent and slaying the wicked.": "除了他们的命令之外，孤独的圣骑士在银河系中追求他们的正义任务，经常与其他不太神圣的冒险家们在一起。在这些队伍中，圣骑士的区别在于他们坚定不移的荣誉和忠诚，以及他们对保护无辜者和杀戮邪恶者的偏好。",
	"Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.": "成为一名圣骑士需要宣誓，使圣骑士致力于正义的事业，这是一条积极打击邪恶的道路。当他或她达到3级时，最后的誓言是所有圣骑士训练的高潮。一些拥有这个等级的角色在达到3级并做出这个誓言之前，不认为自己是真正的圣骑士。对其他人来说，实际的宣誓只是一种形式，是对圣骑士内心深处一直以来的真实想法的一种正式印记。",
	"Wanderlust is in a ranger's blood. These master survivalists can set foot on just about any world and scrounge up enough food and water to survive there, but that's never enough; they need to keep exploring and seeing new horizons everywhere. In the 'verse, rangers feel most at home on the Galactic Frontier, planet-hopping between unseen worlds, far from the boundaries of squabbling galactic empires. Any sane adventuring party traveling that far from the galactic core counts a ranger among their number, for only an expert ranger can brave the perils of those undiscovered worlds and live to tell the tale.": "漫游是游侠的血液。这些生存大师几乎可以踏上任何一个世界，并在那里找到足够的食物和水来生存，但这永远是不够的；他们需要不断探索，看到各地的新视野。在'诗篇'中，游侠们在银河系边境感觉最自在，在看不见的世界之间跳来跳去，远离争吵的银河系帝国的边界。任何理智的冒险队伍在远离银河系核心的地方旅行时，都会把游骑兵算作他们的一员，因为只有专业的游骑兵才能勇敢面对那些未被发现的世界的危险，并活着讲述这个故事。",
	"The ideal of the ranger has many expressions, from the nimble two-weapon fighter, to the deadly marksman, and everything in between.": "游骑兵的理想有许多表现形式，从灵活的双武器战士到致命的射手，以及两者之间的一切。",
	"Crooks, criminals, smugglers, thieves; rogues in the 'verse have many names, none of them kind. Perhaps the most generous name applied to many rogues is 'Contractor', which signifies that they have a specific arrangement, a contract, with the Firm, the most notorious criminal organization in the 'verse. The Firm hires Contractors of all types, from the impressively strong, to the magically talented, to those with technological know-how, and signs them on for limited-time jobs. The Firm pays its Contractors well, and demands total compliance in return, no matter what they ask.": "骗子、罪犯、走私者、盗贼；流氓在 \"诗篇 \"中有许多名字，但都不是善类。也许适用于许多流氓的最慷慨的名字是 \"承包商\"，这意味着他们与公司有一个特定的安排，一个合同，公司是诗篇中最臭名昭著的犯罪组织。事务所雇用各种类型的承包商，从令人印象深刻的强者，到有魔法天赋的人，再到拥有技术知识的人，并与他们签订有限时间的工作。该公司付给承包商高额报酬，并要求他们完全服从，无论他们要求什么。",
	"This association with the Firm and other criminal enterprises has soured the reputation of many rogues in the 'verse, who would rather use their resourcefulness and talents elsewhere. So-called 'independent' rogues, like many smugglers and hackers, struggle to shake the stigma that clings to everyone in their profession, due in large part to the Firm and its contracts.": "这种与公司和其他犯罪企业的联系使许多流氓的声誉受损，他们宁愿在其他地方使用他们的智慧和才能。所谓的 \"独立 \"流氓，就像许多走私者和黑客一样，努力摆脱附着在他们行业中每个人身上的耻辱，这在很大程度上是由于公司和它的合同。",
	"Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.": "流氓有许多共同的特点，包括他们强调完善他们的技能，他们对战斗的精确和致命的方法，以及他们越来越快的反应。但不同的流氓在不同的方向上引导这些天赋，体现在流氓原型上。你对原型的选择反映了你的关注点--不一定是你所选择的职业的标志，而是对你偏好的技术的描述。",
	"There is magic in blood; there always has been, and there always will be. Sorcerers are arcanists by heritage, tracing their magic back to noble ancestries of dragons, demons, and angels, but others still acquire their sorcerous magic in their lifetimes, becoming the first in a new line of sorcerers. Because of the sheer prevalence of strange magical effects in the 'verse, sorcerers spawned by exposure to life-changing arcana outnumber those of magical bloodlines. Sorcerers who gain their power in this way, such as by being bombarded by radioactive voidlights, by being tinged by the darkness of a black hole, or by being infested with a swarm of nanobots, can never return to their old lives, and instead turn to adventuring, exploring, and mercenary work to practice their new magic and make ends meet.": "血液里有魔法；过去有，将来也会有。巫师的遗产是奥术师，他们的魔法可以追溯到龙、恶魔和天使的高贵祖先，但其他人仍然在他们的一生中获得了巫术魔法，成为新的巫师系列中的第一人。由于奇怪的魔法效果在 \"诗篇 \"中非常普遍，通过接触改变生活的奥术而产生的巫师比那些有魔法血统的人更多。以这种方式获得力量的巫师，比如被放射性虚空光轰击，被黑洞的黑暗所染，或者被一群纳米机器人侵袭，永远无法回到他们原来的生活，而是转向冒险、探险和雇佣兵工作，以练习他们的新魔法并维持生计。",
	"Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: an eldritch bloodline and the influence of exotic magical energy.": "不同的巫师声称他们天生的魔法有不同的起源。虽然存在许多变化，但这些起源大多分为两类：长生的血统和异国的魔法能量的影响。",
	"When the poor, weak, and defenseless cry out, wardens answer. These mighty guardians are chosen to be sentinels or vulnerable worlds and lone outposts. Every warden is impelled by a call, most often to protect individuals, but sometimes to defend an idea from those that would despoil it. Whereas a paladin chooses their oath, a champion's call irresistibly draws its warden, and it is on the warden alone to honor it.": "当穷人、弱者和毫无防备的人呼喊时，看守人就会回应。这些强大的守护者被选为哨兵或脆弱的世界和孤独的前哨。每个守护者都被一种召唤所驱使，最常见的是保护个人，但有时是为了保护一种思想不被那些人掠夺。虽然圣骑士选择了他们的誓言，但冠军的召唤却不可抗拒地吸引着它的守护者，而且只有守护者才会履行它。",
	"Throughout the 'verse, many wardens are called to defend the galaxy from profoundly dangerous threats: extra-galactic entities, sinister factions, and reality-damaging technology. Few things are more important, and wardens seldom turn their back on calls of such enormity.": "在整个 \"诗篇 \"中，许多看守人被要求保卫银河系，使其免受极度危险的威胁：银河系外的实体、险恶的派系和破坏现实的技术。很少有比这更重要的事情，狱警们很少会对这种巨大的召唤置之不理。",
	"A warden's call is a binding charge to protect and defend others from harm. Every warden eventually hears a call, and responds with mighty deeds. In answering this call, they embrace the traits of those they stand to protect, gaining primal, and sometimes even mystical, abilities.": "典狱长的号召是一种有约束力的指控，要保护和捍卫他人免受伤害。每个典狱长最终都会听到召唤，并以强大的行动来回应。在响应这一召唤的过程中，他们接受了他们所要保护的人的特征，获得了原始的，有时甚至是神秘的能力。",
	"Lawbringers hear the steady, unyielding call of universal law and follow it without question. This set of invisible guidelines organizes the universe into its current state, but deviations from it threaten to destabilize all of creation. Reckless reality changing, time travel, and immortality are all violations of this law, and must be punished. Lawbringers are summoned to enforce laws both magical and mundane, and to deliver punishment when necessary.": "守法者听到了稳定的、不屈不挠的宇宙法则的召唤，并毫不怀疑地遵循它。这套无形的准则将宇宙组织成目前的状态，但对它的偏离有可能会破坏所有的创造物的稳定。肆无忌惮地改变现实、时间旅行和永生都是对这一法律的违反，必须受到惩罚。执法者被召唤来执行魔法和世俗的法律，并在必要时给予惩罚。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, lawbreakers can never escape your mark. When a creature you have marked within 30 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to move up to half your movement speed. You must end your movement closer to the marked creature than you began.": "从第三级开始，违法者永远无法逃脱你的标记。当一个被你标记的生物在你30英尺范围内移动时，你可以使用你的反应来移动，最多达到你移动速度的一半。你必须在结束移动时比开始时更接近被标记的生物。",
	"At 3rd level, you have advantage on ability checks you make to discern if a creature you can see is telling the truth.": "在3级时，你在辨别你所看到的生物是否说实话的能力检查中具有优势。",
	"At 6th level, you can cast the spell {@spell command} once without using a spell slot. This spell targets each creature you choose within 30 feet of you, using the same command for each target. The saving throw for this ability is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "在6级时，你可以在不使用法术槽的情况下施展该法术（%0%）一次。这个法术的目标是你选择的30英尺范围内的每个生物，对每个目标使用相同的指令。这个能力的蓄力值是8+你的熟练度加成+你的体质修正值。一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短暂或长时间的休息。",
	"Starting at 13th level, your mind is a fortress, unbendable and unbreakable. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Whenever you succeed on a saving throw against an enchantment spell or an ability that attempts to cloud your thoughts or control your mind, the caster takes {@damage 4d6} psychic damage.": "从13级开始，你的思想是一座堡垒，不可弯曲，不可打破。你对被魅惑或被惊吓的救赎有优势。每当你对试图蒙蔽你的思想或控制你的心智的魔法或能力的救赎成功时，施法者会受到0%的精神伤害。",
	"At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into an embodiment of universal law, a ticking construct of inevitable intent. For 1 minute, you gain the following features:": "在20级的时候，作为一个动作，你可以转化为宇宙法则的化身，一个具有不可避免的意图的定时器。在1分钟内，你会获得以下特征。",
	"You can't be exhausted, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned.": "你不能被耗尽、惊吓、抓紧、丧失能力、瘫痪、石化、中毒、击倒在地、被束缚或被击晕。",

	"You can use your Mandate ability at will.": "你可以随意使用你的任务能力。",
	"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "一旦你使用这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成长时间的休息。",
	"When most people of the 'verse stare up at the night sky, a twinkle of wonder and curiosity glistens in their eyes; warlocks, however, shudder at the black chasm of the sky, for they have seen what dwells in the great beyond and know the horror that awaits travelers to the stars.": "当大多数人注视着夜空时，他们的眼中闪烁着惊奇和好奇；然而，术士们对天空的黑色鸿沟感到不寒而栗，因为他们已经看到了大千世界中居住的东西，知道等待星空旅行者的恐怖。",
	"Warlocks that travel the 'verse in search of eldritch secrets often uncover things far more terrifying than they bargained for. Out among the stars, the antediluvian patrons are more ancient, more enigmatic, than terrestrial beings, and offer darker secrets to their followers. These patrons might be colossal alien beasts, strange entities sequestered away within stars or black holes, or the everpresent Void itself.": "为了寻找长生不老的秘密而旅行的术士们，往往会发现比他们的讨价还价更可怕的东西。在星空中，远古的守护者比陆地上的生物更古老、更神秘，并向他们的追随者提供更黑暗的秘密。这些赞助者可能是巨大的外星野兽，被封存在恒星或黑洞中的奇怪实体，或永远存在的虚空本身。",
	"The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.": "作为术士的赞助人，他们是其他存在领域的强大居民--不是神，但他们的力量几乎是神一样的。不同的赞助人让他们的术士获得不同的力量和召唤，并期望得到重要的好处作为回报。有些赞助人收集术士，相对自由地发放神秘知识，或吹嘘他们有能力将凡人束缚在自己的意志之下。其他赞助人只是不情愿地赋予他们的权力，并可能只与一个术士签订契约。为同一赞助人服务的术士可能会将对方视为盟友、兄弟姐妹或竞争对手。",
	"For generations prior to the advent of space travel, the College of Warmages operated as a mercenary force, with few, if any, political ties. They trained legions of warriors in a simple, yet extremely effective style of magic which made them nigh undefeatable on the battlefield.": "在太空旅行出现之前的几代人中，暖男学院作为一支雇佣兵部队运作，几乎没有任何政治关系。他们用一种简单而又极其有效的魔法风格训练战士军团，使他们在战场上几乎无往不利。",
	"Initially based on Camberly, a world now in the heart of Hegemony territory, the College quickly became a major player in the Human Alliance. However, when the Rift War split human-controlled space in two, it similarly divided the College. Many of those who remained in the newly-formed Hegemony found themselves frustrated with generations of College leaders who had turned the organization away from its original purpose. To this end, the College built inroads with the Coalition and endeavored to move their base of operations to Fraxus-8.": "最初，学院的总部设在坎伯利，一个现在处于霸权领土中心的世界，它很快就成为人类联盟的一个主要参与者。然而，当裂谷战争将人类控制的空间一分为二时，它也同样分裂了学院。许多留在新形成的霸权中的人发现自己对几代学院领导人感到失望，他们使组织偏离了最初的目的。为此，学院与联盟建立了联系，并努力将他们的行动基地转移到Fraxus-8。",
	"Warmages who served with Lakshay, standing against the onslaught of the Warhorde, were offered a place of honor in the court of General Sun Wokung. Seizing the opportunity to forge something more meaningful than a mercenary force, the warmages of Lakshay founded the Court of the Celestial Lion, enveloping their previous warmage houses into their new organization and establishing a new house, the House of Lancers. Loyal only to Lakshay and its general, the Court quickly became the backbone of Lakshayan military might.": "为拉克赛服务的暖男们，在抵御沃霍德的进攻时，在孙悟空将军的宫廷中获得了一个荣誉的位置。抓住这个机会，拉克赛的暖男们建立了比雇佣军更有意义的东西，成立了天狮宫，将他们以前的暖男们纳入新的组织，并建立了一个新的家族--长枪党。只忠于拉克赛和它的将军，法院很快成为拉克赛军事力量的骨干。",
	"Within the College, different warmages are divided into separate Houses, each of which emphasizes a different approach to combat.": "在学院内部，不同的热心人被划分为独立的议院，每个议院都强调不同的战斗方法。",
	"Adapted to the modern scale and complexity of interstellar warfare, warmages of the Coalition blend the tactics of the College with formidable blaster technology. Squads of these arcanists form the backbone of Coalition special forces, as their firepower and discipline are unmatched, even among Coalition troops.": "为了适应现代星际战争的规模和复杂性，联盟的热血战士将学院的战术与强大的爆破技术相结合。这些奥术师组成了联盟特种部队的骨干，因为他们的火力和纪律即使在联盟部队中也是无与伦比的。",
	"Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain a specialized spell focus known as a blaster gauntlet, which allows you to apply some of the traits of blasters to cantrips you cast through it.

	"Shooting at a close range target, you increase the cantrip's damage dice by one die size for the attack. For example, if the cantrip deals d6s for damage, it deals d8s instead. If it deals d8s, it instead deals d10s, up to a maximum of d12s. This cantrip can't target a creature further than 10 feet from you.": "向近距离的目标射击，你将咒语的伤害骰子增加一个大小的攻击。例如，如果咒语造成的伤害是d6，那么它将造成d8。如果它造成的是d8的伤害，那么它就会造成d10的伤害，最多达到d12的效果。这个咒语不能针对离你10英尺以外的生物。",

To them, it represents a guiding light in the darkness, a confidant or keeper of secrets, and a link to the powerful natural forces that govern time and tide. Lunar witches are the masters of the night: shadowy, quiet, and exceptionally difficult to pin down.": "月亮对许多女巫来说是一个有力的象征，尤其是那些被迫隐姓埋名从事其艺术的女巫。对他们来说，月亮代表着黑暗中的指路明灯，是秘密的知己或守护者，也是与支配时间和潮流的强大自然力量的联系。月亮女巫是夜晚的主宰：阴暗、安静，特别难以捉摸。",
	"When you join this craft at 3rd level, you gain the ability to drive people mad. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers from one long-term madness effect, selected at random, until the end of your next turn.": "当你在3级时加入这个工艺，你获得了把人逼疯的能力。作为一个动作，选择一个你能看到的60英尺范围内的生物，做一个魅力救赎动作。拯救失败后，该生物会受到一个长期的疯狂效果，随机选择，直到你下一回合结束。",
	"By 6th level, you have developed a supernatural affinity for shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can take the {@action Hide} action as a bonus action.": "到6级时，你已经对阴影有了超自然的亲和力。当你处于昏暗的光线或黑暗的区域时，你可以采取{@action Hide}的行动作为额外行动。",
	"At 10th level, you can use your accursed powers to suppress light around you. As an action, you can cause all areas of direct sunlight within 300 feet of yourself to become bright light, bright light to become dim, and dim light to become total darkness for 10 minutes. Sources of light are still visible; only the illumination they provide is reduced. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you take a short or long rest.": "在10级的时候，你可以使用你的诅咒之力来压制你周围的光线。作为一个行动，你可以使自己周围300英尺内的所有阳光直射区域变成亮光，亮光变成暗光，而暗光变成完全的黑暗，持续10分钟。光源仍然是可见的；只是它们提供的照明会减少。一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再使用它，直到你进行短期或长期休息。",
	"At 14th level, you can see through illusions with ease. You have truesight out to a range of 60 feet and you perceive a shimmering halo of moonlight around any creature you can see that has the shapechanger subtype.": "14级时，你可以轻松地看穿幻象。你拥有60英尺范围内的真实视力，你能感知到在你能看到的任何具有变身者亚型的生物周围有一个闪亮的月光晕。",
	"Nearly all of the cornerstone inventions—arcane batteries, {@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines}, starships, and intelligent constructs—were pioneered by brilliant engineer-wizards, long before gadgeteers and more traditional arcanist-wizards parted paths. In Dark Matter, wizards can have any one of a myriad of roles, and can focus their magic on hundreds of subschools and specialties, but they largely fall into those two main categories: engineer-wizards, which study practical applications of magic, especially as it relates to groundbreaking technologies, and arcanist-wizards, which are concerned with the practice of magic itself in the purest sense. Regardless of their specialty, all wizards push the envelope of arcane understanding through research and experimentation, and are a force to be reckoned with.": "几乎所有的基石发明--甘蔗电池、{@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines}、星际飞船和智能建筑--都是由杰出的工程师-魔法师开创的，早在小发明家和更传统的奥术师-魔法师分道扬镳之前。在《暗物质》中，魔法师可以有无数种角色中的任何一种，并且可以将他们的魔法集中在数百种子流派和专业上，但他们主要分为两大类：工程师魔法师，研究魔法的实际应用，尤其是与突破性技术有关的应用；以及奥术师魔法师，关注最纯粹意义上的魔法实践本身。无论他们的专业是什么，所有的巫师都通过研究和实验来推动对奥术的理解，并且是一种不可忽视的力量。",
	"The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the 'verse, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.": "巫术的研究很古老，可以追溯到最早的凡人发现的魔法。它在 \"诗篇 \"中得到了牢固的确立，有各种传统致力于其复杂的研究。",
	"The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.": "多元宇宙中最常见的奥术传统是围绕着魔法流派展开的。历代的巫师们已经将数以千计的法术编入目录，并将它们归入称为流派的类别。在一些地方，这些传统就是字面上的学校；一个巫师可能在幻术学校学习，而另一个则在城外的魔法学校学习。在其他机构中，这些学校更像是学术部门，相互竞争的院系为学生和资金而竞争。即使是在自己的塔楼里孤独地训练学徒的巫师，也会把魔法分为学校作为一种学习手段，因为每个学校的法术需要掌握不同的技术。",
	"A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.": "特技代表一种天赋或一个专业领域，赋予角色特殊的能力。它体现了训练、经验和超越阶级的能力。",
	"At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.": "在某些级别上，你的等级会给你能力分值提升的特性。使用可选的特技规则，你可以放弃使用该特征，而选择使用一个特技。每项特技你只能选一次，除非特技的描述另有规定。",
	"You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.": "你必须满足某项特技中规定的任何先决条件才能使用该特技。如果你失去了一项特技的先决条件，你就不能使用该特技，直到你重新获得该先决条件。例如，擒拿手特技要求您的力量达到13或更高。如果你的力量以某种方式降低到13以下--也许是由于枯萎的诅咒--你就不能从擒拿手特技中受益，直到你的力量恢复。",
	"These feats are broken up into four broad categories: general feats, which can be taken by any character that meets the prerequisites, racial feats, which can only be taken by members of a particular race, faction feats, which signify one's allegiance with a faction, and ship feats, which directly relate to exemplars of ship combat.": "这些功勋分为四大类：一般功勋，任何符合先决条件的角色都可以服用；种族功勋，只有特定种族的成员才能服用；派系功勋，标志着一个人对某个派系的忠诚；以及船舶功勋，直接与船舶战斗的典范有关。",
	"Whether it's a unique style of blaster combat or an addiction to gambling, one solid personality trait can make a character stand out from the rest. Feats are an excellent way of accomplishing this, while also providing a concrete, mechanical benefit. The following feats can make any character feel like they belong in the world of Dark Matter, but don't rely on a specific race, faction, or ship role.": "无论是独特的冲击波战斗风格还是对赌博的沉迷，一个可靠的个性特征可以使一个角色从其他角色中脱颖而出。特质是实现这一目标的绝佳方式，同时还能提供具体的、机械的好处。下面这些特质可以让任何角色感觉到他们属于《黑暗物质》的世界，但并不依赖于特定的种族、派别或飞船角色。",
	"The new races in the Dark Matter campaign setting are extremely diverse, running the gamut from almost entirely humanoid, to barely resembling a living creature. As such, these new races also have a deep well of expertise to draw upon, as represented in the following feats.": "黑暗物质》战役背景中的新种族非常多样化，从几乎完全是人形，到几乎不像是生物的范围。因此，这些新种族也有很深的专业知识可供借鉴，正如以下功法所代表的那样。",
	"Life on a starship is arduous, and those without proper training can find themselves completely unprepared to face the challenges posed by deep space. Even a simple run-in with a spaceshark or a pack of var'zuul grubs can spell disaster for the uninitiated. The following feats each correspond to a character role aboard a starship, and represent training and expertise in that role.": "星舰上的生活是艰苦的，那些没有经过适当训练的人可能会发现自己完全没有准备好面对深空带来的挑战。即使是与太空鲨或一群var'zuul grubs的简单碰撞，也会给不熟悉的人带来灾难。下面的功绩分别对应于星舰上的一个角色，并代表该角色的训练和专长。",
	"Characters can gain a role feat in two distinct ways: they can pick a role feat when they would normally gain a feat, or the GM can award them to characters who excel in a particular role aboard their starship. Used in this latter way, role feats can serve to cement a character's permanent rank or job among the crew, or can be awarded to represent a character's experience aboard the ship. A character can have only one role feat awarded in such a way at a time.": "角色可以通过两种截然不同的方式获得角色特技：他们可以在正常情况下获得特技时挑选一个角色特技，或者GM可以将其授予在星舰上的某个特定角色中表现出色的角色。在后一种情况下，角色特技可以用来巩固一个角色在船员中的永久等级或工作，也可以用来代表一个角色在飞船上的经验。一个角色在同一时间只能有一个以这种方式授予的角色特技。",
	"Veteran adventurers are likely to make enemies across the 'verse , but if they're lucky, they might forge some alliances too. The greatest of these alliances are likely to be with factions, which provide work, services, and connections to spacers everywhere. Of course, such allies don't come free. Factions generally also require work and commitment from their members, which might come in the form of small tasks, important favors for higher ranking members, or even regular obligations for the organization. For their efforts, adventurers can gain specific and useful skills from their factions, as represented by the feats below:": "资深的冒险家可能会在整个宇宙中树敌，但如果他们幸运的话，他们也可能建立一些联盟。这些联盟中最大的可能是与派别，它们为各地的太空人提供工作、服务和联系。当然，这样的盟友并不是免费的。派别通常也需要其成员的工作和承诺，这可能是小任务的形式，为更高等级的成员提供重要的帮助，甚至是对组织的定期义务。对于他们的努力，冒险者可以从他们的派别中获得具体而有用的技能，正如下面的功绩所代表的那样。",
	"Generally, faction feats can be awarded two ways: players can pick a faction feat when they would normally gain a feat or the GM can offer the feats as incentives to joining a faction or ascending its ranks. In this case, awarding the feat is entirely up to the GM. A faction feat might be awarded the moment the characters sign up with a faction, after training with them for some time, or only after attaining a respectable rank within the organization. A character can have only one faction feat awarded in such a way at a time.": "一般来说，派别特技有两种授予方式：玩家可以在正常情况下获得特技时挑选一个派别特技，或者GM可以提供特技作为加入派别或提升派别等级的奖励。在这种情况下，授予特技完全由GM决定。一个派别的特技可以在角色加入派别时授予，也可以在与派别一起训练一段时间后授予，或者只有在组织内达到一个可敬的等级后授予。一个角色在同一时间只能有一个派别的功绩。",
	"Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a galactic peacekeeper or a grizzled space marine. Your wizard could have been an engineer or a medical doctor. Your rogue might have joined the thieves' network or piloted a commercial ship.": "每个故事都有一个开头。你的角色的背景揭示了你从哪里来，你如何成为一个冒险家，以及你在这个世界上的位置。你的战士可能是银河系的维和人员，也可能是一个灰头土脸的太空人。你的巫师可能是一名工程师或医生。你的流氓可能已经加入了盗贼网络或驾驶一艘商业船只。",
	"Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?": "选择一个背景为你提供了关于你的角色身份的重要故事线索。关于你的背景，最重要的问题是什么改变了？为什么你不再做你的背景所描述的任何事情而开始冒险？你从哪里得到钱来购买你的起始装备，或者，如果你来自一个富有的背景，为什么你没有更多的钱？你是如何学习你所在等级的技能的？是什么让你与与你有相同背景的普通人不同？",
	"In Dark Matter, many already-existing skills take on new and important roles. For example, {@skill Survival} becomes a critical skill in navigating unfamiliar and hostile alien environments, and {@skill Insight} might be used to understand the behaviors of alien races. In addition, there are brand new skills that will be necessary to survive and thrive in the unforgiving 'verse. This section will explore new uses for conventional skills in Dark Matter and will introduce the new skills that will be important in any science fiction campaign.": "在《黑暗物质》中，许多已经存在的技能具有新的和重要的作用。例如，{@skill Survival}成为在陌生和敌对的外星环境中航行的关键技能，而{@skill Insight}可能被用来了解外星种族的行为。此外，还有一些全新的技能，是在无情的'se'中生存和发展的必要条件。本节将探讨《黑暗物质》中传统技能的新用途，并将介绍在任何科幻活动中都很重要的新技能。",
	"Even in a far-flung setting of robots and blasters, there's sometimes no replacement for brute strength. Your Strength check covers your ability to push, drag, lift, run, jump, and break things, and your Athletics check reflects specific types of Strength checks.": "即使是在机器人和爆破手的遥远环境中，有时也无法替代蛮力。你的力量检查涵盖了你推、拖、举、跑、跳和砸东西的能力，而你的运动检查反映了特定类型的力量检查。",
	"As always, your Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check covers any physically imposing situation, from lifting heavy objects, to running, swimming, or climbing. In a science fiction setting, this might extend to various activities during zero-gravity spacewalks or high-gravity environments. Of course, a high Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check might also be used to overpower or disable a construct that would otherwise have the upper hand.": "像往常一样，你的力量({@skill Athletics})检查包括任何体力上的情况，从举起重物，到跑步、游泳或攀爬。在科幻小说中，这可能延伸到零重力太空行走或高重力环境中的各种活动。当然，一个高力量（%1%）的检查也可以用来制服或禁用一个本来占上风的结构。",
	"In addition to the normal uses of a Strength check, the GM might call for you to make a Strength check when you attempt any of the following:": "除了力量检查的正常使用之外，当你尝试以下任何一项时，GM可能会要求你进行力量检查。",
	"Smashing a terminal or blaster.": "砸碎终端或爆破器。",
	"Standing up and moving around in high-gravity environments.": "在高重力环境中站立和移动。",
	"Climbing a rocky ravine on an uncharted world.": "在一个未知的世界上攀登岩石的沟壑。",
	"Manual maintenance of a spacecraft, such as replacing weapons or systems, without construct assistance.": "对航天器进行人工维护，如更换武器或系统，不需要构造物协助。",
	"In a setting where high-power blasters can melt holes in steel plates and pilots can dogfight in zero-gravity, it pays to have a deft hand and fast reflexes. Your Dexterity checks govern your ability to be swift, quiet, or precise, skills which have become exponentially more important with advancing technology.": "在这样一个环境中，大功率爆破器可以在钢板上熔化出洞，飞行员可以在零重力环境下进行狗斗，拥有一双灵巧的手和快速的反应力是值得的。你的灵巧检查决定了你迅速、安静或精确的能力，这些技能随着科技的发展而变得成倍的重要。",
	"As in a conventional setting, your Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check determines how nimble you are and governs your body control in specific circumstances, such as balancing on a narrow ledge,performing a flip, or keeping your footing in a tricky situation. Your GM might ask for these checks to avoid falling when your ship is hit by an unshielded blast, when you try to balance on the ledge of a tall building, or when you try to move quickly in zero-gravity.": "就像在传统环境中一样，你的灵巧（（%0%））检查决定了你有多灵活，并在特定情况下控制你的身体，例如在狭窄的壁架上保持平衡，进行翻转，或在一个棘手的情况下保持你的脚步。当你的飞船被无防护的爆炸击中时，当你试图在高楼的窗台上保持平衡时，或者当你试图在零重力下快速移动时，你的GM可能会要求你进行这些检查以避免坠落。",
	"A new skill in Dark Matter, your Dexterity ({@skill Piloting|DarkMatter}) check covers how well you maintain control over a ship in difficult circumstances. You don't need proficiency in {@skill Piloting|DarkMatter} to fly a ship (be it an aircraft or a spacecraft), but proficiency in this skill can help when you need to make a crash landing or pull off a risky maneuver in a dogfight. The GM might call for a Dexterity ({@skill Piloting|DarkMatter}) check when you attempt to fly a ship through an electromagnetic storm that disrupts the controls, or when you wish to perform a hard stop or pull a high-G turn.": "作为《黑暗物质》的一项新技能，你的灵巧（%0%）检查涵盖了你在困难情况下对飞船的控制能力。你不需要熟练掌握{@skill Piloting|DarkMatter}来驾驶飞船（无论是飞机还是航天器），但当你需要迫降或在狗斗中完成一个危险的动作时，熟练掌握这个技能可以帮助你。当你试图驾驶飞船通过破坏控制的电磁风暴时，或者当你希望执行硬停或进行高G转弯时，GM可能会要求你进行灵巧（（%2%））检查。",
	"In science fiction settings, blasters, {@item datapad|darkmatter|datapads}, and gadgets are the chief domain for the {@skill Sleight of Hand} skill. This skill determines how well you can conceal objects on your person, slyly pilfer them into your pockets, plant objects on others, and otherwise furtively move small things about. You will likely require a Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to hide a blaster (such as a {@item phaser|darkmatter}) on your person, draw and aim a blaster at a close target without their knowledge, swap a {@item datapad|darkmatter} with a fake, or use any gadget or magic item stealthily.": "在科幻小说中，爆破器、（%0%）和小工具是（%1%）技能的主要领域。这个技能决定了你能在多大程度上隐藏你身上的物品，狡猾地把它们偷放到你的口袋里，把物品放在别人身上，以及以其他方式偷偷摸摸地移动小东西。你可能需要通过灵巧（（%%2%））检查来隐藏身上的爆破器（如（%%3%）），在不知情的情况下拔出爆破器并瞄准近距离目标，将（%%4%）换成假的，或隐秘地使用任何小工具或魔法物品。",
	"Whereas {@skill Sleight of Hand} governs how to sneakily move objects, Stealth governs how well you sneakily move or hide yourself.

	"Balancing several things in your arms at once.": "同时在你的怀里平衡几样东西。",
	"Quickly performing a well-rehearsed sequence of actions, such as disassembling and reassembling a device.": "迅速完成一连串精心排练的动作，如拆卸和重新组装一个设备。",
	"Constitution measures your bodily toughness, your ability to take a punch, and your ability to withstand pain. Though there are no skills directly tied to Constitution, this score determines your all-important hit points, and is therefore indispensable in any campaign.": "体质衡量你的身体韧性，你承受拳头的能力，以及你承受痛苦的能力。虽然没有与体质直接相关的技能，但这个分数决定了你最重要的命中率，因此在任何战役中都是不可或缺的。",
	"Your GM might call for a Constitution check to accomplish any of the following tasks:": "你的总经理可能会要求进行宪法检查以完成以下任何任务。",
	"Maintaining consciousness in extreme g-forces, such as when maneuvering a fighter above its maneuverability limit or passing near a black hole.": "在极端的重力作用下保持意识，例如当操纵战斗机超过其可操作性极限或在黑洞附近通过时。",

	"Breathing through air choked by smoke, sand, or vapors.": "通过被烟雾、沙子或蒸汽窒息的空气呼吸。",
	"An acute mind, technical insights, and an expansive education are invaluable assets in any science fiction setting. Though the Intelligence score, which measures one's acuity, logic, and memory, has always been important to a number of skills in conventional campaign settings, it takes on a role of paramount importance in Dark Matter, for Intelligence is the singular tool one uses to modify and exploit technology.": "敏锐的头脑、技术上的洞察力和广泛的教育在任何科幻设定中都是无价的资产。虽然衡量一个人的敏锐度、逻辑性和记忆力的智力分值在传统的战役设置中一直对一些技能很重要，但在《暗物质》中，它的作用极其重要，因为智力是一个人用来修改和利用技术的唯一工具。",
	"The {@skill Arcana} skill reflects your knowledge on a wide range of magical subjects, from understanding the theory and practice of spellcasting, to comprehending the planes of the multiverse, to recalling lore about magic items. Importantly, however, the {@skill Arcana} skill doesn't govern magical technology, which includes ships and most of the magic items that are included in this book—that knowledge is encompassed in the {@skill Technology|DarkMatter} skill. The GM might call for an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check when you examine a strange dimensional anomaly in space, when you need to determine which type of spells or spellcaster might have caused a particular effect, when you must unravel a heretofore unseen magical effect, or when you try to understand esoteric magical concepts, like the nature of a vect's soul.": "{@skill Arcana}技能反映了你在广泛的魔法主题上的知识，从了解法术的理论和实践，到理解多元宇宙的平面，再到回忆关于魔法物品的传说。然而，重要的是，{@skill Arcana}技能并不管理魔法技术，其中包括船只和本书中包含的大多数魔法物品--这些知识都包含在{@skill Technology|DarkMatter}技能中。当你检查空间中一个奇怪的维度异常时，当你需要确定哪种类型的法术或施法者可能造成了一个特定的效果时，当你必须解开一个前所未见的魔法效果时，或者当你试图理解深奥的魔法概念时，比如一个vect的灵魂的性质时，GM可能会要求进行智力（%3%）检查。",
	"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence ({@skill Data|DarkMatter}) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the {@skill Technology|DarkMatter} skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a {@item datapad|darkmatter}, an {@item arcane terminal|darkmatter}, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an {@item interface rig|darkmatter} is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence ({@skill Data|DarkMatter}) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.": "这个在黑暗物质中的新技能决定了一个人能够多好地操纵技术界面并获得信息或其他功能。你的智力（{@skill Data|DarkMatter}）检查包含了你对软件及其利用的知识，而不是硬件（硬件由{@skill Technology|DarkMatter}技能覆盖），所以只有在你使用有界面的技术时才会用到，比如{@item datapad|darkmatter}、{@item arcane terminal|darkmatter}、飞船的电脑，或者其他控制技术，比如门控或控制{@item shield generator|darkmatter}或飞船武器的电脑。如果一项技术没有接口，则需要一个（%5%）来与之互动。当你试图对一个数据系统进行复杂的操作时，当你试图对一个构造物进行重新编程时，或者当你试图入侵一个设备时，GM应该要求进行智力（%6%）的检查。",
	"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called {@b Hacking} and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence ({@skill Data|DarkMatter}) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's {@item datapad|darkmatter} to give you access to their information or bank account.": "任何一种非法或未经授权进入技术系统的行为都被称为{@b Hacking}，需要使用{@item interface rig|darkmatter}，以及智力{@skill Data|DarkMatter}检查。一般来说，黑客尝试需要使用技术进行1分钟的工作，尽管GM可以决定某些任务可能只需要一个行动。在黑客检查成功后，你可以对系统进行操作，就像你有完全的权限一样。如果检查失败，就掷一个D6。如果是6，设备就会被锁住，不能再尝试入侵它。更安全的设备可能会在掷出5或6时锁定，或在掷出4至6时锁定，由GM决定。你可以入侵设备，非法进入安全系统，打开门，解除警报，或者操纵别人的（3%），让你获得他们的信息或银行账户。",
	"In Dark Matter, the {@skill History} skill is far broader than in other campaign settings, for it encompasses history from all across the galaxy, as well as xenogeography, the study of distant worlds. An Intelligence ({@skill History}) check can reveal facts about recent or ancient wars, insights about important figures, living and dead, the different worlds that are controlled by the {@race elf|phb|elves} or {@race avia-ra|darkmatter}, or the differences between the Hegemony and Lakshay. Additionally, if you are marooned on a strange planet, this can help determine the planet's identity, provided the planet has been noted in historical record.": "在《黑暗物质》中，{@skill History}技能比其他战役背景下的技能要广泛得多，因为它包含了整个银河系的历史，以及对遥远世界的研究--异域地理学。情报学（{@skill History}）检查可以揭示关于最近或古代战争的事实，关于重要人物的见解，活着的和死去的，被{@race elf|phb|elves}或{@race avia-ra|darkmatter}控制的不同世界，或者霸权和拉克西的区别。此外，如果你被放逐到一个陌生的星球上，这可以帮助确定这个星球的身份，只要这个星球在历史记录中被注明。",
	"As always, your Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check measures your active attempts to search for something, and governs your deductions about what you find. This check covers detective work of all kinds, from finding hidden objects, patterns, or clues, to determining what kind of blaster made a particular blast mark, to analyzing a ship for structural weaknesses.": "像往常一样，你的智力({@skill Investigation})检查衡量你主动尝试去寻找什么，并管理你对你所发现的东西的推断。这个检查涵盖了所有类型的侦探工作，从寻找隐藏的物体、模式或线索，到确定哪种爆破器制造了一个特定的爆炸痕迹，再到分析一艘船的结构缺陷。",
	"As with {@skill History}, the {@skill Nature} skill is vastly expanded in Dark Matter, for it covers knowledge of animals, plants, and terrain, from all across the galaxy.

A successful check can help you identify the holy symbols of a cult, recall the rites and prayers of the {@race avia-ra|darkmatter}, or identify the marks of divine magic.": "你的智力({@skill Religion})检查衡量你回忆整个'se'的数千个不同宗教和神话的传说的能力。这既包括现代的教条，如{@race avia-ra|darkmatter}或神殿所持的教条，也包括古老的传统，如高等泰拉的古老神灵或尊敬的矮人万神殿。成功的检查可以帮助你识别一个邪教的神圣符号，回忆起{@race avia-ra|darkmatter}的仪式和祈祷，或者识别神圣魔法的标记。",
	"Your Intelligence ({@skill Technology|DarkMatter}) check measures your ability to understand the inner workings of technological devices. Most devices are powered by some form of magic, but plenty of intricate design goes into channeling that magic into useful effects. Use this skill to understand unfamiliar or complex technology or to modify or repair devices. The GM may call for an Intelligence ({@skill Technology|DarkMatter}) check when you attempt to modify a blaster, repair your ship's {@item shield generator|darkmatter}, disable a rogue android, or sabotage an {@item arcane terminal|darkmatter}.": "你的智力({@skill Technology|DarkMatter})检查衡量你理解技术设备内部运作的能力。大多数设备都是由某种形式的魔法驱动的，但大量复杂的设计是为了将魔法引导到有用的效果中。使用这个技能来了解不熟悉的或复杂的技术，或者修改或修理设备。当你试图改造一个爆破器，修理你的飞船的{@item shield generator|darkmatter}，禁用一个流氓机器人，或破坏一个{@item arcane terminal|darkmatter}时，GM可能会要求你进行智力({@skill Technology|DarkMatter})检查。",
	"Your GM may call for Intelligence checks to accomplish any of the following tasks:": "你的总经理可以要求进行智力检查以完成以下任何任务。",
	"Solving a cypher or a riddle.": "解开一个密码或谜语。",
	"Estimating the value of a ship's cargo.": "估计船舶货物的价值。",
	"Reading corrupted data on an {@item arcane terminal|darkmatter}.": "在一个{@item arcane terminal|darkmatter}上读取损坏的数据。",
	"Calculating the trajectory of a falling spacecraft.": "计算下落的航天器的轨迹。",
	"Winning a logic game against a construct.": "赢得一场针对构架的逻辑游戏。",
	"In many ways, Wisdom is the silent ability score. It governs your connections to the world at large, and your experience within it, which in turn influences your intuition, awareness, and decision-making skills, especially when a gut call needs to be made or a moral conundrum presents itself.": "在许多方面，智慧是无声的能力得分。它支配着你与整个世界的联系，以及你在其中的经验，这反过来又影响着你的直觉、意识和决策能力，尤其是在需要做出直觉判断或出现道德难题的时候。",
	"In Dark Matter, your Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check governs how you interact with animals, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial, domesticated and wild. This check applies to a myriad of alien beasts and might be useful when attempting to ride a strange alien horse-bird or when calming down a baby {@creature spaceshark|darkmatter}.": "在黑暗物质中，你的智慧({@skill Animal Handling})检查决定了你如何与动物互动，包括陆生和外星的，驯养的和野生的。这个检查适用于无数的外星野兽，在试图骑上一只奇怪的外星马鸟或安抚一个婴儿时可能会很有用（%1%）。",
	"Understanding a creature's motivations, intentions, and emotional state is the domain of your Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. This skill is especially useful when a foreign (or alien) language or culture acts as a barrier for communication; a successful check can elucidate another creature's intents, even across such gaps. You can use this skill in lieu of a {@item universal translator|darkmatter}, or when encountering an alien race that doesn't communicate using conventional language or telepathy.": "了解一个生物的动机、意图和情绪状态是你的智慧（（%0%））检查的范畴。当外国（或外来）语言或文化成为交流的障碍时，这个技能特别有用；成功的检查可以阐明另一个生物的意图，即使是在这种差距中。你可以用这个技能来代替{@item universal translator|darkmatter}，或者在遇到不使用传统语言或心灵感应进行交流的外星种族时。",
	"You use a Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check to stabilize dying allies and to diagnose illnesses. The result of this check chiefly reflects your medical experience, but in a setting like Dark Matter, can also be used to make guesses about alien biology or pathology. This is exceptionally useful when a party consists of a wide range of races from across the galaxy.": "你用智慧({@skill Medicine})检查来稳定垂死的盟友并诊断疾病。这个检查的结果主要反映你的医疗经验，但在像黑暗物质这样的环境中，也可以用来猜测外星人的生物学或病理学。当一方由来自整个银河系的各种种族组成时，这一点特别有用。",
	"As always, you use a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check when you attempt to notice, detect, spot, or hear something. If you are not actively looking for something, your GM might use your passive {@skill Perception} score instead of asking for you to roll a check. This skill is often contrasted with the Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, which is used when you're searching for something specific (or checking if something specific is present), whereas the Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check measures whether or not you've noticed something out of the ordinary. You can use this skill to check for the sounds of an ambush, notice the tell-tale signs of ships flying overhead, or sense if someone is getting ready to fire a concealed blaster.": "像往常一样，当你试图注意、探测、发现或听到某些东西时，你要使用智慧（（%0%））检查。如果你没有主动寻找什么东西，你的GM可能会使用你的被动（%1%）得分，而不是要求你进行检查。这个技能通常与智力（（%2%））检查相对应，后者用于你寻找特定的东西（或检查是否有特定的东西存在），而智慧（（%3%））检查衡量你是否注意到一些不寻常的东西。你可以用这个技能来检查是否有埋伏的声音，注意到头顶上飞过的船只的蛛丝马迹，或者感知是否有人准备发射隐藏的爆破器。",
	"The {@skill Survival} skill is a critical for those exploring the universe, especially when touching down on strange, alien planets. This skill is normally used to hunt, follow tracks, and gather food, but in Dark Matter, a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check can also be used to determine which types of alien plants and animals are edible, dangerous, or intelligent, to navigate unseen alien environments, and to predict the weather (and weather-like phenomena) on alien worlds. Additionally, this skill can be used to determine the identity of a planet, provided the planet has been visited before and has some sort of unique natural characteristic.": "{@skill Survival}技能对于那些探索宇宙的人来说至关重要，特别是在陌生的外星星球上着陆时。这个技能通常用于打猎、追踪足迹和收集食物，但在《黑暗物质》中，智慧（%1%）检查也可以用来确定哪种类型的外星植物和动物是可食用的、危险的或智能的，为看不见的外星环境导航，并预测外星世界的天气（和类似天气的现象）。此外，这个技能还可以用来确定一个星球的身份，前提是这个星球以前被访问过，并且有某种独特的自然特征。",
	"Your GM might call for a Wisdom check to accomplish any of the following tasks:": "你的总经理可能会要求用智慧检查来完成以下任何一项任务。",
	"Determining if a newly-discovered creature is intelligent, hostile, or both.": "确定一个新发现的生物是否有智慧，是否有敌意，或者两者都有。",
	"Following a gut feeling of whether to fight, flee, or negotiate with an unidentified ship.": "遵循直觉，是打仗、逃亡还是与不明身份的飞船谈判。",
	"Figuring out if the smuggler lost your blasters, or stole them.": "弄清楚走私者是弄丢了你的爆破器，还是偷了它们。",
	"Understanding the bad feeling that you get when flying into an asteroid field.": "理解你在飞入小行星领域时的不良感觉。",
	"Across the many worlds of the 'verse, the power of persuasion is the one skill guaranteed to make you coin and friends, whether it's in a Halfling Hearthstation or in the halls of the Solar Citadel. Adventurers and traders who have a forceful personality are often referred to as 'Faces' for their ability to put a friendly face on any situation. Many Charisma skills are fundamentally unchanged in Dark Matter, but their contexts will be far more important, as the reputations these skills shape can spread across the 'verse faster than any ship.": "在众多的世界中，说服力是保证你能赚取钱财和朋友的一项技能，无论是在半身人的炉台还是在太阳城的大厅。拥有强势人格的冒险者和商人经常被称为 \"面孔\"，因为他们有能力在任何情况下都能表现出友好的一面。许多魅力技能在《黑暗物质》中基本没有变化，但它们的背景将更为重要，因为这些技能所塑造的声誉可以比任何船只更快地传播到整个'se'。",
	"Your Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check determines how well you can lie, withhold information, or otherwise mislead others. This skill can cover everything from lies of omission, to misrepresenting true facts, to full-scale con jobs. You might use this skill to fast-talk your way onto a starship without registering, lead inspectors away from smuggled cargo, disguise yourself on a hostile world, conceal your intentions from a sepulcher knight, or tell a blatant lie to an orcish warlord.": "你的魅力({@skill Deception})检查决定了你在撒谎、隐瞒信息、或以其他方式误导他人方面的能力。这个技能可以涵盖一切，从遗漏的谎言，到歪曲真实的事实，再到全面的诈骗工作。你可能会用这个技能来快速地谈论你登上星舰的方式而不去登记，引导检查员远离走私货物，在一个敌对的世界上伪装自己，从一个墓园骑士那里隐瞒你的意图，或者对一个兽人军阀说一个公然的谎言。",
	"When you choose to use direct threats, physical coercion, or even subtle statements of future retribution, your GM might ask you to use a Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check. You might employ these tactics when interrogating a Tower agent for information, shaking down a shopkeep for a few coins, or when you intend to frighten a petty thug into leaving you be.": "当你选择使用直接威胁、身体胁迫、甚至是未来报复的微妙声明时，你的GM可能会要求你使用魅力（（%0%））检查。你可能会在审问塔楼特工以获取信息时使用这些策略，为了几个硬币而敲诈店主，或者当你打算吓唬一个小混混让他离开你时。",
	"Whether it's singing a ballad or entertaining a crowd with some simple magic tricks, your Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check determines how well you can enthrall an audience and entertain individuals.": "无论是唱民谣还是用一些简单的魔术来娱乐观众，你的魅力({@skill Performance})检查决定了你有多大能力来吸引观众和娱乐个人。",
	"When diplomacy is in order, you can influence someone using the {@skill Persuasion} skill, pulling out all manner of charm, tact, and convincing arguments in order to influence someone. Your Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check is normally used as a catch-all for convincing someone through conversation, as long as your methods don't more appropriately fall under {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, or {@skill Performance}. You might use this skill to win allies to your side with a quid pro quo argument, convince an intelligent monster to delay consuming you until after it has taken a long nap, or convince an {@race amoeboid|darkmatter} scientist to share its research with you.": "在外交方面，你可以使用{@skill Persuasion}技能来影响别人，拿出各种魅力、策略和令人信服的论据来影响别人。只要你的方法不属于{@skill Deception}、{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Performance}的范畴，你的魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查通常被用来作为通过谈话说服别人的万能工具。你可以用这个技能通过交换条件的论证来赢得盟友加入你的阵营，说服一个聪明的怪物推迟消费你，直到它打了个长盹，或者说服一个（%5%）科学家与你分享他的研究。",
	"Your GM may call for a Charisma check to accomplish any of the following tasks:": "你的总经理可能会要求进行魅力检查以完成以下任何任务。",

	"\"Don't you worry, Rami, I know what I'm doing,\" Nano assured her. \"You'd better get on the pulse cannon, Mek. Never know what might be out there.\"": "\"你不用担心，拉米，我知道我在做什么，\"纳诺向她保证。\"你最好上了脉冲炮，梅克。永远不知道外面会有什么。\"",
	"The feathered monk obliged, lowering himself into a seat surrounded by shimmering scrying mirrors, with control yokes built into each arm. As he did so, the whole ship seemed to awaken with magical energy, Rami having found her way to the engine room.": "羽毛和尚答应了，把自己放倒在一个座位上，周围是闪闪发光的窥视镜，每个手臂上都有控制轭。当他这样做的时候，整艘船似乎被魔法能量唤醒了，拉米已经找到了她去引擎室的路。",
	"\"Fasten your seatbelts, everyone,\" Nano announced, firing up the impulse thrusters, \"we don't exactly have clearance to take off, so this might be a little bumpy...\"": "\"大家系好安全带，\"纳诺宣布，启动脉冲推进器，\"我们并没有确切的起飞许可，所以这可能会有点颠簸......\"",
	"And indeed it was, but once their Freelancer was clear of the station, they were away quickly, launching into a void jump moments after passing through the hangar doors. A blind jump, yes, but one Nano was familiar with. Besides, the Miaam-Osk Pathway had long been a favorite route for both smugglers and legitimate merchants, so even if the jump wasn't entirely accurate, there would be enough beacons, signals and landmark planetoids to get back on track.": "确实如此，但是一旦他们的自由者号离开了空间站，他们就迅速离开了，在通过机库门后不久就开始了虚空跳跃。一个盲目的跳跃，是的，但纳诺对它很熟悉。此外，米亚姆-奥斯克通道长期以来一直是走私者和合法商人最喜欢的路线，所以即使跳跃并不完全准确，也会有足够的信标、信号和标志性的行星来回到轨道上。",
	"As the ship progressed through the void, Rami popped back to the bridge. \"If them Firm boys are anywhere, they'll be in the Whiteglass cluster at the far edge of the Miaam system. The asteroids there block all divination magic somehow. It's a good place to hide...\"": "当飞船在虚空中前进时，拉米突然回到了舰桥。\"如果那些坚定的男孩在任何地方，他们会在米亚姆系统最边缘的白镜群中。那里的小行星以某种方式阻止了所有的占卜魔法。那是个藏身的好地方......\"",
	"\"...but it also means they won't be able to see us coming.\" Mekhet-Nu finished the thought.": "\"......但这也意味着他们将无法看到我们的到来。\" 梅克特-努完成了这个想法。",
	"\"Excellent. Let's go steal us an arcane warhead.\"": "\"很好。我们去给我们偷一个奥术弹头吧。\"",
	"Sure enough, they touched down on one of the icy asteroids without any kind of interception. \"Are you sure they're here?\" asked Mekhet-Nu, while he nonetheless readied his sunstaff in a battle stance.": "果然，他们在没有任何拦截的情况下降落在其中一个冰冷的小行星上。\"你确定他们在这里吗？\"梅克特-努问道，而他还是以战斗的姿态准备好他的太阳杖。",
	"\"You saw the junk drifting around up there. Someone's here, and if their lack of respect for interplanetary littering laws is anything to go by, I deduce they must be hardened criminals,\" whispered Nano, expression unreadable.": "\"你看到上面漂浮着的垃圾了。有人在这里，如果他们不尊重星际垃圾法的话，我推断他们一定是顽固的罪犯。\"纳诺低声说，表情看不出来。",
	"\"Did—did the vect just tell a joke?\" Rami gawked.": "\"那......那医生刚才说了一个笑话吗？\" 拉米瞪大了眼睛。",
	"Her bewilderment was interrupted by a flurry of blaster fire, which began to scythe through the party from an unseen pillbox, half buried in snow.": "她的困惑被一阵爆破炮火打断了，这些炮火开始从一个看不见的、半埋在雪地里的药箱中穿过队伍。",
	"\"Damn it!\" Rami cursed, ducking and rolling to one side. Seeing Firm goons appearing out of their holes, she hurled a fireball, scorching the nearest group.": "\"该死的！\" 拉米咒骂着，躲开并滚到一边。看到坚定的歹徒从他们的洞中出现，她扔出一个火球，烧毁了最近的一群。",
	"Meanwhile, Nano triggered a gadget, deploying a large hemisphere of force around the three of them. \"Here, save your spells. I grabbed a carbine for you from the ship; it should be enough to hold them off while I get set up.\"": "同时，纳诺触发了一个小工具，在他们三人周围部署了一个大的半球形的力量。\"在这里，保存你的法术。我从船上给你拿了一把卡宾枪；在我准备好的时候，它应该足以拖住他们。\"",
	"\"Set up?\" Rami tried to ask, but another hail of fire came in, shattering the gadgeteer's temporary dome. Hitting the deck, she used a cantrip to raise a low wall out of ice. \"Blast it, Mek, get down!\"": "\"设置了吗？\" 拉米想问，但又是一阵火光袭来，击碎了小精灵的临时穹顶。打到甲板上，她用咒语在冰上升起一道矮墙。\"炸掉它，梅克，下来！\"",
	"The avia-ra, several scorch marks already burned into his muscular chest, squawked as he fired his sunstaff into the attackers, but soon realized that Rami had a point. Against so many, defensive measures would be necessary.": "阿维亚拉的肌肉胸膛上已经烧出了几道焦痕，他一边叫着一边用太阳杖向攻击者射击，但很快就意识到拉米说得有道理。面对这么多的人，防卫措施是必要的。",
	"The two of them exchanged shots with the smugglers, pinning some of them down, but doing little to reduce their numerical advantage. Before long, Firm gunmen were moving into flanking positions, and one of their leaders shouted: \"I don't know who you are, but anyone who thinks they can barge onto our asteroid and get away alive can't be very smart! We'll be taking that ship, too!\"": "他们两人与走私者交火，将其中一些人击倒，但对减少他们的人数优势没有什么作用。没过多久，坚定的枪手们就进入了侧翼位置，他们中的一个领导人喊道。\"我不知道你是谁，但任何认为他们可以闯入我们的小行星并活着离开的人都不会很聪明！\"。我们也要拿下那艘船！\"",
	"Just then, Nano stopped working on a turret-like device. \"Don't count your roaches before you've jumped, fleshbag!\" The device then began to glow.": "就在这时，纳诺在一个类似炮台的装置上停止了工作。\"在你跳下去之前不要数你的蟑螂，肉包子！\" 然后，该装置开始发光。",
	"\"Is that... should we...?\" Rami stammered.": "\"那是......我们应该......吗？\" 拉米结结巴巴地说。",
	"\"Yes, we should probably get out of the way. The targeting matrix in this is kind of... improvised.\"": "\"是的，我们也许应该让开路。这里面的目标定位矩阵有点......即兴的。\"",
	"The three of them scrambled away, just in time to see Nano's hastily-constructed turret let loose a beam of crackling energy, which then proceeded to sweep through the ranks of assailants, jerking up and down to eliminate targets both near and far.": "他们三个人争先恐后地跑开，正好看到纳诺匆忙建造的炮塔释放出一束噼里啪啦的能量，然后继续扫过袭击者的队伍，上下抽动，消灭远近的目标。",
	"When the screeching turret at last quieted, Nano was the first to speak. \"Well, they aren't storing the warhead on the surface at least. Thankfully for us. Come on, it must be somewhere inside.\"\"": "当刺耳的炮塔终于安静下来时，纳诺第一个发言。\"好吧，他们至少没有把弹头存放在表面。对我们来说是值得庆幸的。来吧，它一定在里面的某个地方。\"",
	"Across the 'verse, new advances are constantly pushing the pinnacle of technology. Fundamental limitations, like the speed of light and force of gravity, have long been broken by magic, but with the advent of magical technology, anyone can sidestep the bounds of physics. In most of the galaxy, spacefaring vessels are commonplace, blasters have replaced conventional firearms, and constructs, living and otherwise, have become a mundane sight.": "在整个宇宙中，新的进展不断推动着技术的巅峰。基本的限制，如光速和引力，早已被魔法所打破，但随着魔法技术的出现，任何人都可以绕过物理学的界限。在银河系的大部分地区，太空船是很常见的，爆破器已经取代了传统的枪械，而建筑，无论是活的还是其他的，都已经成为一种平凡的风景。",
	"Such high technology will be invaluable to adventurers and explorers, who risk their lives daily in the harsh expanse of space. This chapter details new options for magical technology, which ranges from essential gear to blasters and other weapons. The most advanced magical equipment is more potent and unique—essentially magic items in their own right. Additionally, this section contains a number of upgrade components, which can be installed directly into the bodies of vect or other creatures.": "这样的高科技对于冒险家和探险家来说将是无价之宝，他们每天都在严酷的太空中冒着生命危险。本章详细介绍了魔法技术的新选择，其范围从基本装备到爆破器和其他武器。最先进的魔法装备具有更强的效力和独特性--本质上就是魔法物品本身。此外，本节还包含一些升级组件，可以直接安装在vect或其他生物的身体里。",
	"Weapons in the Dark Matter setting range from traditional swords and shields to advanced pieces of technology, powered by void crystals or arcane batteries. There are many who believe that the old weapons are more elegant or civilized, while others maintain that a simple blaster is reliable enough for almost any engagement. As a result, axes, blasters, bows, and energy blades crisscross the 'verse—a culmination of eras and fighting styles all contending in combat.": "黑暗物质设定中的武器从传统的剑和盾牌到先进的技术作品，由虚空水晶或奥术电池驱动。有很多人认为古老的武器更优雅或更文明，而其他人则坚持认为简单的爆破器几乎对任何交战都足够可靠。因此，斧头、爆破器、弓箭和能量刀纵横交错，这是各种时代和战斗风格在战斗中的巅峰对决。",
	"This section introduces a few of the high technology options available to players, including blasters and laser swords. All of the following weapons except for the {@item skathári warclub|darkmatter} and {@item wrenchinator|darkmatter} count as magical technology.": "本节介绍了一些可供玩家选择的高技术，包括爆破手和激光剑。除了{@item skathári warclub|darkmatter}和{@item wrenchinator|darkmatter}之外，以下所有的武器都算作魔法技术。",
	"Blasters are arcane weapons that eschew traditional projectiles in favor of energetic pulses, powered by arcane batteries and focused through specialized apertures. Because they self-recharge, blasters need not ever be reloaded, even though some are prone to overheating.": "爆破器是奥术武器，它摒弃了传统的投射物，转而使用能量脉冲，由奥术电池提供能量，并通过专门的孔隙集中。因为它们可以自我充电，所以爆破器永远不需要重新装弹，尽管有些爆破器容易过热。",
	"Unlike other weapons, you don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of a blaster unless otherwise stated.": "与其他武器不同的是，除非另有说明，否则你不会将你的能力修饰值加到冲击波的伤害卷上。",
	"Unlike other ranged weapons, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with two light blasters. When you do so, you subtract 2 from the damage roll of the bonus attack, to a minimum of 1 damage.": "与其他远程武器不同，你可以用两把轻型爆破枪进行双武器战斗。当你这样做时，你从奖励攻击的伤害卷中减去2，最低为1的伤害。",
	"Many in the 'verse, including quite experienced spacers, prefer the reliability of a sword or the heft of an axe. After all, for all their dazzle, blasters and energy weapons are fallible: they can malfunction, be disabled by Dead Magic Zones, and simply fall to pieces. None of these apply to good old-fashioned weapons. As such, every weapon in the SRD has a place in Dark Matter.": "许多人在'诗篇'中，包括相当有经验的太空人，更喜欢剑的可靠性或斧头的厚重感。毕竟，尽管它们很耀眼，但爆破器和能量武器是有缺陷的：它们可能发生故障，被死亡魔法区破坏，或者干脆摔成碎片。这些都不适用于好的老式武器。因此，SRD中的每一种武器都在《黑暗物质》中占有一席之地。",
	"Of course, even among those who would eschew a blaster in favor of a close-quarters weapon, there are many who prefer high-tech options. The {@item laser sword|darkmatter} is an extremely popular choice with everyone from backwater hermits to trained sepulcher knights, as it combines the traditionalism of a steel sword with the advantages of modern technology. Most high-tech melee weapons in Dark Matter share a similar appeal, since exotic materials and fixed-length energy blades have novel properties not found elsewhere.": "当然，即使在那些愿意放弃爆破手而选择近身武器的人中，也有许多人喜欢高科技的选择。{@item laser sword|darkmatter}是一个非常受欢迎的选择，从落后的隐士到训练有素的墓园骑士，因为它结合了钢剑的传统性和现代技术的优势。黑暗物质》中的大多数高科技近战武器都有类似的吸引力，因为奇异的材料和固定长度的能量刀具有其他地方没有的新颖特性。",
	"Other weapons, such as the {@item plasma cutter|darkmatter}, {@item thermal lance|darkmatter}, and {@item wrenchinator|darkmatter}, are more tools than weapons, but have become a favorite with spacers everywhere, due in part to their availability, and part to their brutal effectiveness.": "其他武器，如{@item plasma cutter|darkmatter}、{@item thermal lance|darkmatter}和{@item wrenchinator|darkmatter}，与其说是武器，不如说是工具，但已经成为各地太空人的最爱，部分原因是它们的可用性，部分原因是它们的残酷有效性。",
	"Avia-Ra {@item sunstaff|darkmatter|Sunstaff}": "阿维亚-拉 {@item sunstaff|darkmatter|Sunstaff}",
	"In the extensive Dead Magic Zones prevalent throughout the 'verse, gnomes have thrived using blasters powered by technological means, rather than magical ones. In fact, nearly all of gnomish technology forgoes magic in favor of their strange and complex technologies, for gnomish science sees itself as equal to all arcana.": "在整个 \"诗篇 \"中普遍存在的广泛的 \"死亡魔法区 \"中，地精使用由技术手段而非魔法手段驱动的爆破器而繁荣起来。事实上，几乎所有的地精技术都放弃了魔法，而选择了他们奇怪而复杂的技术，因为地精的科学认为自己与所有的奥术是平等的。",
	"A gnomish blaster is functionally much the same as an ordinary one, but costs twice as much, deals force damage instead of the blaster's normal damage type, and functions normally in Dead Magic Zones.": "地精的爆破器在功能上与普通的爆破器基本相同，但成本是普通爆破器的两倍，造成武力伤害，而不是爆破器的正常伤害类型，并且在死亡魔法区的功能正常。",
	"Gnomish technology still counts as magical technology for the purposes of spells and magical effects that influence such technology.": "地精的技术仍然算作魔法技术，以影响这种技术的法术和魔法效果为目的。",
	"Just as the onward march of technology has pushed handheld weapons from crossbows to blasters, so too has it improved and iterated on armor from plate mail to hightech nanofiber materials. These more complex materials are mostly constructed to absorb and deflect hazardous energies, but still provide ample defense from physical damage.": "正如技术的前进推动了手持武器从弩到爆破器一样，它也改进和迭代了盔甲，从板甲到高科技的纳米纤维材料。这些更复杂的材料主要是为了吸收和偏转有害的能量，但仍然提供充足的物理伤害防御。",
	"The gradient of armors on offer in the SRD are more than sufficient to outfit characters of any class, and most classes are designed with these statistics in mind. Therefore, to maintain the game's balance, Dark Matter doesn't employ any additional armor options, but rather suggests alternative names for them, in keeping with the science-fiction setting. The Armor table above shows these new names and also restates the armors' statistics, for convenience.": "SRD中提供的盔甲梯度足以装备任何等级的角色，而且大多数等级的设计都考虑到了这些统计数据。因此，为了保持游戏的平衡，《黑暗物质》没有采用任何额外的盔甲选项，而是为它们建议了其他名称，以符合科幻小说的设定。上面的盔甲表显示了这些新的名称，为了方便起见，还重述了盔甲的统计数据。",
	"Some class features (such as the Gadgeteer's Experimental Frame) and equipment (such as the Spiked Plating construct graft) give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.": "一些阶级特征（比如小发明家的实验框架）和装备（比如尖刺镀层构造嫁接）给了你不同的方法来计算你的AC。如果你有多个特性给你不同的方法来计算你的攻击力，你可以选择使用哪一个。",
	"High technology comes in a wide degree of forms, from legendary artifacts of unspeakable complexity, to the humble {@item life suit|darkmatter}. Practical technology might not be the most glamorous, but it's certainly indispensable: no ship could travel far in the 'verse without functioning life suits, and explorers would literally be in the dark without {@item flashlight|darkmatter|flashlights}. Of course, adventurers and explorers still make use of conventional gear, much of which has evolved with the march of progress: healer's kits, locks, and manacles have all changed considerably, but they still serve the same purpose. Other things, like backpacks, have hardly changed at all.": "高科技的形式多种多样，从复杂得难以言喻的传奇文物，到简陋的（%0%）。实用技术可能不是最迷人的，但它肯定是不可缺少的：在'诗篇'中，如果没有正常的救生衣，任何船只都无法远行，而探险家如果没有（1%），简直就是在黑暗中。当然，冒险家和探险家仍然使用传统的装备，其中许多装备随着进步的脚步而演变：治疗包、锁和手铐都有很大的变化，但它们仍然有相同的用途。其他东西，如背包，几乎没有任何变化。",
	"The following devices are considered magical technology: {@item bottled lightning|darkmatter}, {@item comm set|darkmatter|comm sets}, {@item concussion grenade|darkmatter|concussion grenades}, {@item datapad|darkmatter|datapads}, {@item flashlight|darkmatter|flashlights}, {@item holo-sphere|darkmatter|holo-spheres}, {@item igniter|darkmatter|igniters}, {@item interface rig|darkmatter|interface rigs}, {@item life suit|darkmatter|life suits}, {@item log keeper|darkmatter|log keepers}, {@item quadcorder|darkmatter|quadcorders}, and {@item wristwatch|darkmatter|wristwatches}.

	"{@race Vect|darkmatter} can replace sections of their bodies with customized or improved components with ease.

Uncovering or vying to control an artifact can form the basis for entire campaigns, prompting the ascension of new villains and staunch allies around the characters.": "神器是撼动战役的魔法物品，是完全独特的、具有奇异力量的物品。一个普通的魔法物品可能会改变一个角色或一个王国，而神器则与宇宙本身交织在一起。揭开或争夺对神器的控制可以构成整个战役的基础，促使新的反派人物和人物身边的坚定盟友登场。",
	"Some artifacts are merely objects of ruinous power, imbued with arcana from the very conception of the universe, when magic was still lithe and youthful. Others are stained with divine magic or are intertwined with the fabric of the multiverse. In most cases, however, an artifact's power is simply too great for mortal hands. Even if its might were placed in the right hands, the eventuality of sinister forces gaining control over it would spell inevitable doom. Adventurers, therefore, often make it their mission to destroy artifacts they encounter, a task which normally entails a great quest of its very own, for artifacts can't be sundered easily.": "有些艺术品仅仅是具有毁灭力量的物品，从宇宙诞生之初就被灌注了奥术，那时魔法还很轻盈，很年轻。其他的则沾染了神圣的魔法，或者与多元宇宙的结构交织在一起。然而，在大多数情况下，一件神器的力量对于凡人的手来说实在是太伟大了。即使它的力量被放在正确的人手中，邪恶的力量获得对它的控制也会带来不可避免的厄运。因此，冒险家们经常把摧毁他们遇到的神器作为自己的任务，这项任务通常需要一个伟大的探索，因为神器不可能被轻易割断。",
	"No artifact should be placed in a campaign lightly. These items are as much plot devices as they are treasure; they appear when the GM desires and leave when the story demands it. For better or for worse, stories featuring artifacts will gravitate around the items' incredible power, so they should be used carefully, conservatively, and deliberately.": "任何神器都不应该被轻易地放在竞选活动中。这些物品既是剧情装置，也是宝物；它们在GM希望的时候出现，在故事需要的时候离开。不管是好是坏，以神器为特色的故事都会围绕着这些物品的不可思议的力量而展开，所以应该谨慎、保守、有意识地使用它们。",

	"\"Three unidentified bogeys approaching from another part of the asteroid field. I'm trying to confirm whether or not they're hostile...\" said Nano, prompting Rami to jump onto the intercom.": "\"三个不明身份的敌机从小行星区的另一个地方接近。我正试图确认它们是否有敌意...... \"纳诺说，促使拉米跳上对讲机。",
	"\"Don't bother, skip—they're hostile. I'm wanted in over a hundred systems, Mek's got an entire empire out to get him, and we just stomped all over the Firm's flower beds.\"": "\"别费劲了，跳过--他们是有敌意的。我在一百多个系统中被通缉，Mek有一个完整的帝国要抓他，而我们刚刚踩遍了公司的花坛。\"",
	"\"I don't recall seeing any flowers, but the other two are good points. Battle stations!\"": "\"我不记得看到过什么花，但其他两个是好的观点。战位！\"",
	"Like most craft designed in the Hegemony of Man, this Freelancer was compact, efficient and easy to fly, allowing Nano to swing the ship around the asteroid in a tight arc, and come around the other side pointing straight at the hostile targets.": "与人类霸权中设计的大多数飞船一样，这艘自由人飞船结构紧凑，效率高，易于飞行，允许纳诺将飞船以紧密的弧线围绕小行星摆动，然后从另一侧绕过，直指敌对目标。",
	"Mekhet-Nu, as dexterous with the pulse cannon controls as he was with his sunstaff, seized the initiative the instant his targets came into view. Two bolts of radiant energy screamed into one of the oncoming ships, blasting huge chunks out of its hull.": "Mekhet-Nu，对脉冲炮的控制和他的太阳杖一样灵巧，在他的目标出现在视野中的一瞬间就抓住了主动。两道辐射能量射向其中一艘迎面而来的战舰，将其船体炸出一大块。",
	"Nano could see the attackers now: three ships with Firm markings, weapons charged. Two were small fry, Privateers by the looks of them, and one already damaged. The other appeared to be a Smuggler ship, much like the Freelancer the trio were flying.": "纳诺现在可以看到攻击者了：三艘有公司标志的船，武器已经装好。有两艘是小船，从外观上看是私人船只，其中一艘已经损坏。另一艘似乎是一艘走私船，很像三人所驾驶的自由者号。",
	"\"Nice shot Mek, but now it's my turn,\" came Rami's voice from the engineer's post. \"It's about time I put this arcane cannon to good use...\"": "\"射得好，梅克，但现在轮到我了。\"拉米的声音从工程师的岗位上传来。\"是时候让我好好利用这门奥术炮了......\"",
	"An ominous hum began to drone out of the bowels of the engine room.": "一个不祥的嗡嗡声开始从引擎室的深处传出。",
	"The attackers were getting closer now, firing with all available weapons. The first barrage tore down the shields and lanced into the lone Freelancer's armor plating, setting off alarm sirens on Nano's console. The vect silenced them with a gesture.": "攻击者现在越来越近，用所有可用的武器进行射击。第一轮炮击击碎了护盾，并射入孤独的自由人的装甲层，在纳诺的控制台上发出警报声。兽医用一个手势让它们安静下来。",
	"\"It looks like they're splitting up to get at us from the sides. Rami, keep the shield facing their Smuggler. Mek, take down those Privateers, now!\"": "\"看起来他们正在分头行动，从侧面对付我们。拉米，让盾牌面对他们的走私者。Mek，打倒那些私掠者，现在！\"",
	"Fighting to keep up with the evasive maneuvers of his targets, Mekhet-Nu could only score one hit with his second salvo; the damaged Privateer retaining just enough structural integrity to remain a threat. Meanwhile, auto turret shots continued to impact their port side.": "为了跟上目标的回避动作，Mekhet-Nu在第二轮炮击中只能打中一发子弹；受损的私掠者只保留了足够的结构完整性来保持威胁。同时，自动炮塔的射击继续冲击他们的左舷。",
	"\"I'm doing the best I can, Nano,\" the monk replied, eyes still glued to his screens. \"Damage?\"": "\"我正在尽力而为，纳诺，\"和尚回答说，眼睛仍然紧盯着他的屏幕。\"损害？\"",
	"\"Nothing too bad yet, but I think they've got the same idea about charging their arcane cannon...\"": "\"还没有什么太糟糕的事情，但我认为他们对充实他们的奥术炮有同样的想法......\"",
	"Rami's voice came on the intercom, saying \"Don't worry kids, there's no way they've got a wizard out here who can go toe to toe with me for long!\" Presently, a blizzard of icy shards blasted out of the Freelancer's arcane cannon, obliterating the undamaged Privateer and ripping into the frontal armor of the lead Firm ship. The small firebolt they produced in reply was off target, and things suddenly looked a lot better for the three thieves.": "对讲机里传来拉米的声音，说：\"别担心，孩子们，他们在这里不可能有一个巫师能和我长时间交手！\" 当下，一阵冰冷的碎片从自由者号的奥术炮中轰出，湮没了那艘未受损伤的私掠者号，并撕开了领先的坚定号的正面装甲。他们作为回应的小火球偏离了目标，而对这三个盗贼来说，事情突然看起来好了很多。",
	"The Firm ships kept up the chase for a short time, firing a few more desultory volleys, but Mekhet-Nu's accurate fire soon eliminated the second Privateer and forced the last, crippled survivor to disengage.": "坚船利炮在短时间内继续追击，又进行了几轮不痛不痒的射击，但梅克尔-努的精确射击很快就消灭了第二艘私掠船，并迫使最后一艘残缺不全的幸存者脱离了战斗。",
	"\"Hey Rami, you've still got that map to Garfeckt's hoard, right?\" Nano asked, preparing to chart a new—and even more dangerous—course. \"Let's lay in the coordinates.\"": "\"嘿，拉米，你仍然有那张通往加菲克特囤积物的地图，对吗？\" 纳诺问道，准备制定一个新的、甚至更危险的路线。\"让我们把坐标放进去。\"",
	"Be it for planet-hopping exploration, high-stakes smuggling, or white-knuckle dogfighting, no campaign in Dark Matter is complete without a starship. This chapter details how to use Dark Matter engines, ship statistics, crew roles, ship combat, and space exploration. Additionally, it includes a plethora of ship options.": "不管是在星球间的探索、高风险的走私，还是白刃战，在《黑暗物质》中，没有一艘星际战舰是不完整的。本章详细介绍了如何使用《黑暗物质》的引擎、飞船统计、船员角色、飞船战斗和空间探索。此外，它还包括大量的飞船选项。",
	"The common saying goes: 'No two ships in the 'verse are alike.' Though any mechanic will tell you that this isn't exactly true, the meld of magic and technology spacefaring vessels employ to cross the gulfs of space vary in thousands of ways. Even ships laid down in the same yard to the same specification are likely to go through multiple refits, overhauls, and repairs during their lives, leaving them unrecognizable after a few years in the Black. For most purposes, ships are described by statistics which include the following information: Size classification, hit points, shield points, Armor Class, engines, systems, crew, cargo, cost, challenge, and weapons, all of which are detailed below.": "俗话说 宇宙中没有两艘船是一样的'。尽管任何一个机械师都会告诉你这并不完全正确，太空船在穿越太空的沟壑时采用的魔法和技术的融合有成千上万种不同的方式。即使是在同一个船厂按照同样的规格建造的船只，在它们的生命中也可能会经历多次改装、大修和修理，使它们在黑夜中几年后无法识别。在大多数情况下，舰艇是由包括以下信息的统计数据来描述的。尺寸分类、命中率、护盾点数、装甲等级、引擎、系统、船员、货物、成本、挑战和武器，所有这些都在下面详细说明。",
	"More details for how these statistics are used can be found in the Ship Combat section.": "关于如何使用这些统计数据的更多细节，可以在舰船战斗部分找到。",
	"Ships are categorized according to their Size Classification, which generally determines other important aspects: its crew size, top speed outside of void jumps, maneuverability, and durability. For example, a larger ship might be able to carry more men and guns, but a smaller ship can outrun and outmaneuver it. Different size classifications are detailed in the Size Classification table below.": "舰艇是根据其尺寸分类的，这通常决定了其他重要的方面：它的船员规模、虚空跳跃之外的最高速度、机动性和耐久性。例如，一艘较大的船可能会携带更多的人员和枪支，但一艘较小的船可以超越它，并在机动性方面胜过它。不同的尺寸分类详见下面的尺寸分类表。",
	"Ships also mention which race generally builds that type of ship. This has no mechanical effect on its own; instead, it gives an impression about which types of creatures might be piloting them, and what statistics you can expect from that type of ship. For example, Hammers, which are dwarven fighters, are sturdily built, and possess a higher Armor Class than many other fighters as a result.": "船只还提到哪个种族通常建造该类型的船只。这本身没有任何机械作用；相反，它给人的印象是哪种类型的生物可能会驾驶它们，以及你可以从该类型的飞船中得到什么数据。例如，锤子是矮人的战斗机，建造得很结实，因此拥有比许多其他战斗机更高的装甲等级。",
	"Additionally, the Ship Classification table indicates the size of a ship in feet and its size using the optional Grid Combat rules. The sizes listed are maximum sizes.": "此外，船舶分类表显示了船舶的尺寸（以英尺为单位）以及使用可选的网格战斗规则的尺寸。列出的尺寸是最大尺寸。",
	"A typical adventuring party might begin their adventures with a modest personal ship and invest in larger, more capable vessels as their fortunes grow. Larger parties, however, will find the cargo space and crew capacity of a transport ship essential. At very high levels, characters might enlist a crew to man a frigate or even an entire fleet.": "一个典型的冒险队伍可能从一艘小型的个人船只开始冒险，随着财富的增长，他们会投资于更大、更有能力的船只。然而，更大的队伍会发现运输船的货物空间和船员能力是必不可少的。在非常高的级别，人物可能会招募船员来管理一艘护卫舰甚至整个舰队。",
	"In general, a party's character level has no bearing on ship size (and by extension, ship combat power), but a GM can award a party with larger ships as they grow in level. As such, the Ship Classification table also includes a recommended character level for some ship sizes.": "一般来说，一方的角色等级与船的大小（以及延伸到船的战斗力）没有关系，但GM可以在一方的等级增长时给予他们更大的船。因此，船舶分类表也包括一些船舶尺寸的推荐人物等级。",

	"In many ways, the rules of space combat are the same as regular combat, but bigger. If you're not sure how to create new stats or how to interpret an effect happening at starship scale, remember that hit points and damage (which use mega points), movement speed, and ship scale are generally scaled up by 100 times. This can provide a good rule of thumb when a quick decision is necessary at the table.": "在许多方面，太空战斗的规则与普通战斗相同，但规模更大。如果你不确定如何创建新的状态，或者如何解释在星舰规模下发生的效果，请记住，命中率和伤害（使用巨型点数）、移动速度和飞船规模通常是按100倍的比例放大的。当需要在桌子上做出快速决定时，这可以提供一个很好的经验法则。",
	"Like creatures and structures, ships have an Armor Class (AC). Unlike creatures, however, a ship's Armor Class is perfectly literal: it represents how heavily armored a ship is and determines how successful an attack is likely to be.": "像生物和结构一样，船舶有一个装甲等级（AC）。然而，与生物不同的是，船舶的装甲等级是完全的字面意思：它代表了船舶的装甲程度，决定了攻击的成功率。",
	"The damage necessary to injure and kill the hardiest of men is paltry compared to the durability and lethality of an entire starship. Therefore, ships use Mega Hit Points, instead of regular hit points, to describe their damage and repair. A single mega hit point equals 100 hit points. A ship's hit points represent the resilience of its hull.": "与整艘星舰的耐久性和杀伤力相比，伤害和杀死最顽强的人所需的伤害是微不足道的。因此，飞船使用巨型命中率，而不是普通的命中率，来描述它们的伤害和修复。一个巨型打击点等于100个打击点。一艘船的命中率代表了其船体的复原力。",
	"In addition to hit points, many ships have Shield Points, (expressed in mega points) which determine how much damage can be absorbed by the ship's shield.": "除了命中率之外，许多船只还有护盾点数，（以兆分表示），它决定了船只的护盾可以吸收多少伤害。",
	"Shields are always created by a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} system and are controlled by the ship's engineer.": "护盾总是由{@item shield generator|darkmatter}系统创建，并由飞船的工程师控制。",
	"Ships generally have two Engine types, a {@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engine} to perform void jumps, and an Impulse engine, used to maneuver when not in the Void. Each impulse engine has a given Speed in hundreds of feet per turn and a Maneuverability score, measured in degrees, which determines a ship's cone of movement.": "舰船通常有两种引擎类型，一种是{@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engine}用于执行虚空跳跃，另一种是脉冲引擎，用于在不在虚空时进行机动。每个脉冲引擎都有一个给定的速度，以每回合数百英尺为单位，还有一个可操作性分数，以度数计算，决定了一艘船的移动锥度。",

	"If the need arises, a ship can temporarily take on more passengers than it can safely support. Doing so taxes the life-support, however, and can only be performed for a short time. For each day that the ship is above its passenger capacity, every passenger onboard gains one level of exhaustion. These levels of exhaustion can't be removed by those aboard until the ship is once again below capacity.": "如果有需要，一艘船可以暂时接纳比它能安全支持的更多乘客。然而，这样做会对生命支持系统造成负担，而且只能在短时间内进行。船只每超过一天的载客量，船上的每个乘客都会获得一个级别的疲惫。这些等级的疲惫不能被船上的人消除，直到船只再次低于容量。",
	"Each ship has a fixed Cargo capacity, which indicates the amount of cargo the ship can carry.": "每艘船都有一个固定的载货量，这表明该船可装载的货物数量。",
	"Most ships can be bought and sold at docks and starports throughout the 'verse, and therefore have an included Cost. This price is a typical figure for a ship of its type, but unscrupulous (or simply ignorant) merchants might sell ships for a far higher or far lower price.": "大多数船只可以在整个大陆的码头和星港进行买卖，因此有一个包含的成本。这个价格是同类型船只的典型数字，但无良（或根本无知）的商人可能以更高或更低的价格出售船只。",

When determining encounter difficulty, it is best to use the average of the party's level and their ship's challenge rating as the party's effective level.": "和怪物一样，飞船也有一个挑战等级，以帮助GM用它们来组成具有挑战性的遭遇战。在确定遭遇战的难度时，最好使用队伍的等级和船只的挑战等级的平均值作为队伍的有效等级。",
	"Ship-mounted weaponry comes in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, from physical battering rams, to extremely large flamethrowers, to deployable mines, but the most common ship-mounted Weapons are based on the same principles as handheld blasters. They are, nonetheless, singularly destructive, capable of melting clean through armored hulls in a single shot.": "舰载武器有各种令人困惑的形状和尺寸，从物理撞锤，到极其巨大的火焰喷射器，再到可部署的地雷，但最常见的舰载武器是基于与手持式爆破器相同的原理。然而，它们具有独特的破坏力，能够在一枪之内将装甲的船体融化干净。",

	"Spacefaring vessels in the 'verse are abundant and varied, reflecting hundreds of societies and their diverse technologies. Nearly all of them operate via a Dark Matter engine, a solid or latticework crystal structure surrounded by heat sinks, stabilizers, and other supporting equipment. These engines are powered by magic, allowing them to carry a ship on short jumps through the Void to cross vast gulfs of space.": "宇宙飞船丰富多样，反映了数以百计的社会和他们不同的技术。几乎所有的飞船都是通过暗物质引擎运行的，这是一个固体或格子状的晶体结构，周围有散热器、稳定器和其他支持设备。这些引擎由魔法提供动力，使它们能够携带飞船在虚空中短距离跳跃，穿越巨大的空间海湾。",
	"{@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines} are the hearts of starships. Most ships also have other engines, called impulse engines, to travel outside of void jumps, but a Dark Matter engine is required to embark on any planet-hopping adventure.": "{@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engines}是星舰的心脏。大多数飞船也有其他引擎，称为脉冲引擎，用于在虚空跳跃以外的地方旅行，但要开始任何行星跳跃的冒险，都需要一个暗物质引擎。",

	"If a spellcaster directly powers the engine using their magic, they can cause a Dark Matter engine to jump two more times on a given day. However, progressively more powerful engines require more arcane magic. A Class 1 engine can be powered by a 1st level spell slot, but a Class 2 engine requires a 2nd level spell slot, and so on.": "如果一个施法者直接用他们的魔法为引擎提供能量，他们可以使一个黑暗物质引擎在某一天再跳两次。然而，逐渐强大的引擎需要更多的奥术魔法。一个1级引擎可以由1级法术槽驱动，但2级引擎需要2级法术槽，以此类推。",
	"Engines with the lowest classes are ostensibly system- hoppers, allowing a small starship to jump around a single system, or to go on longer journeys between nearby systems. Often, these types of ships will need to be carried within higher class starships to cross longer distances.": "最低等级的引擎表面上是系统跳跃器，允许小型星舰在单一系统中跳跃，或在附近系统之间进行较长的旅行。通常情况下，这些类型的飞船需要搭载在更高等级的星舰中，以跨越更远的距离。",

Such an engine could cross the galaxy in a single day, requiring no spellcasters of any sort, and would have to be the direct creation of the gods, or some ancient, mystical alien race.": "10级引擎是严格意义上的理论性或传奇性，这取决于你问谁。这样的引擎可以在一天之内穿越银河系，不需要任何形式的施法者，而且必须是诸神的直接创造，或者是一些古老、神秘的外星种族。",
	"Dark Matter engines are constructed with void crystals at their cores. Rare, fragile, and extracted from the Void at the event horizons of black holes, these crystals are among the most valuable and volatile materials in the 'verse. If a void crystal is damaged in the slightest, it risks not only becoming inoperable, but also collapsing into a {@item sphere of annihilation|dmg}, destroying the rest of the engine and the entire ship. Thus, most of the stabilizing equipment surrounding the core of a Dark Matter engine serves only to insulate and protect the crystal within.": "黑暗物质引擎是以虚空晶体为核心建造的。稀有、脆弱，从黑洞事件视界的虚空中提取，这些晶体是'诗篇'中最有价值和最不稳定的材料。如果一个虚空晶体有丝毫的损坏，它不仅有可能变得无法操作，而且还会崩溃成{@item sphere of annihilation|dmg}，摧毁引擎的其他部分和整个飞船。因此，围绕着暗物质引擎核心的大部分稳定设备只是为了隔离和保护里面的晶体。",
	"To many, it seems that Dark Matter engines are temperamental and perplexing without end, behaving like living things unto themselves. No single race's designs and no particular model accurately represents the variety of these engines; even engines of the same model act differently when fed different types of magical energy.": "对许多人来说，黑暗物质引擎似乎是喜怒无常的，令人困惑不已，其行为就像自己的生命体。没有一个种族的设计，也没有一个特定的模型能准确地代表这些引擎的多样性；即使是同一模型的引擎，在输入不同类型的魔法能量时也有不同的表现。",
	"When a ship has long had a warlock working as an engineer, the Dark Matter engine may start to belch clouds of sulfur and brimstone, and charge faster when those aboard the ship are miserable. Wizards, on the other hand, keep rather tidy, if meticulously modified, engines, which are likely to pulse with rhythmic bursts of force when engaged in a jump. The variations are endless: engines run by illusionists chromatically aberrate the air around them, druid-kept engines sprout twigs and grass in their crevices, and some dwarven engines produce a small amount of beer as exhaust.": "当一艘船长期有一个术士担任工程师时，黑暗物质引擎可能会开始喷出硫磺和硫磺云，当船上的人感到痛苦时就会加速充电。另一方面，巫师们保持着相当整洁的，如果经过精心改造的引擎，在参与跳跃时可能会出现有节奏的力量爆发的脉冲。变化是无穷无尽的：幻术师运行的引擎会使周围的空气产生色差，德鲁伊保存的引擎会在缝隙中长出树枝和草，一些矮人的引擎会产生少量的啤酒作为排气。",
	"All Dark Matter engines, regardless of type, require significant energy to charge-up before a jump. Older or worn models of engine can take several hours of warm-up time, during which they must be fed a continuous stream of magical energy. In general, assume that an engine requires 1 minute of warm-up time prior to a jump.": "所有的暗物质引擎，不管是什么类型，在跳跃前都需要大量的能量来充电。较老的或磨损的发动机型号可能需要几个小时的预热时间，在此期间，它们必须被持续地输入魔法能量。一般来说，假设一个引擎在跳跃前需要1分钟的预热时间。",
	"Ship-mounted weapons are among the most lethal devices ever conceived. A direct shot with any of these massive weapons can vaporize an unprotected person, but no less is necessary to pierce the armored hull of a starship.": "舰载武器是有史以来最致命的装置之一。用这些巨大的武器直接射击可以蒸发一个没有保护的人，但要刺穿一艘星舰的装甲船体，也是必不可少的。",

	"Many ship weapons rely on blaster technology, which are powered strictly by the ship's {@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engine}, and don't require ammunition of any sort. Other ship weapons (especially those favored by gnomes) are more closely related to firearms in design and require ammunition, or deploy from the ship and fly independently, almost like separate vehicles. Ammunition and deployable weapons have independent costs and must be purchased separately.": "许多飞船武器都依赖于爆破技术，这些武器严格由飞船的（%0%）提供动力，并且不需要任何类型的弹药。其他的飞船武器（尤其是那些地精喜欢的武器）在设计上与火器更接近，需要弹药，或者从飞船上部署并独立飞行，几乎像独立的车辆。弹药和可部署的武器有独立的成本，必须单独购买。",
	"The largest of ships, which are equipped with dozens of guns, don't so much fire them independently as they do shell an entire area. This is called a broadside attack. When a ship makes a broadside attack, each mega creature and the pilot of each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Broadside attacks require a gunner, much like other attacks.": "最大的舰艇，配备了几十门火炮，与其说是独立开火，不如说是对整个区域进行炮击。这被称为 \"侧翼攻击\"。当一艘船进行侧翼攻击时，区域内的每个巨型生物和每艘船的驾驶员都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，如果蓄力失败则受到全额伤害，如果蓄力成功则受到一半的伤害。舷侧攻击需要一个炮手，和其他攻击一样。",
	"A broadside attack can only be used once on each round. If a broadside attack is disabled, it can still be used to make an attack, but deals only half damage on a failed saving throw, and no damage on a successful save.": "侧面攻击在每个回合只能使用一次。如果侧翼攻击被禁用，它仍然可以用来进行攻击，但在救赎失败时只造成一半的伤害，而在救赎成功时没有伤害。",
	"A ship with broadside attacks can't replace them with other ship weapons.": "拥有宽舷攻击的舰艇不能用其他舰艇武器代替。",
	"Some ships have tremendous built-in melee weapons, designed to crush, rip, and tear other ships into pieces.

Ship melee weapons can't be replaced like normal ship weapons, nor can they replace normal ship weapons.": "一些战舰有巨大的内置近战武器，旨在将其他战舰碾压、撕裂、撕成碎片。为了在特别近的范围内使用，这些武器可以针对相邻方格内的任何其他船只或巨型生物（500英尺内的目标）。舰船近战武器不能像普通舰船武器一样被替换，也不能替换普通舰船武器。",
	"A ship relies on a myriad of technological systems to provide most of its noncombative functions. All ships have a ship computer which provides executive function to all its other systems, and nearly all possess a life support system.": "一艘船依靠无数的技术系统来提供其大部分的非战斗性功能。所有的飞船都有一台飞船计算机，为所有其他系统提供执行功能，而且几乎所有的飞船都拥有一个生命支持系统。",

Upgrading a Dark Matter engine on a ship larger than a frigate is generally impossible, as larger engines are too deeply interconnected to the ship to be replaced.": "尽管有风险和成本，你可以将一艘船的暗物质引擎升级1级（或将1级暗物质引擎安装到一艘没有的船上），工作时间为7天，材料和人工成本如暗物质升级表所示。在比护卫舰大的舰艇上升级暗物质引擎通常是不可能的，因为更大的引擎与舰艇之间的联系太深，无法被替换。",
	"The ideal ship would have dozens of weapons installed on every external surface, covering every possible direction with extreme firepower. Reality, however, gets in the way. Because each weapon needs a gunner, each external weapon is linked to a single gunner station on the inside of the ship. Unfortunately, this means most ships can't install additional weapons—doing so would require a complete overhaul of the ship's internal layout.": "理想的飞船会在每个外部表面安装几十种武器，用极端的火力覆盖每个可能的方向。然而，现实是有障碍的。因为每件武器都需要一个炮手，每件外部武器都与船内的一个炮手站相连。不幸的是，这意味着大多数战舰不能安装额外的武器--这样做需要对战舰的内部布局进行彻底的改造。",
	"It is relatively simple, however, to replace one ship weapon with another. Doing so requires 1 day of work and the cost of the weapon to be installed. Removed weapons can be kept in storage (though most are massively heavy and spacious) or sold at half market value.": "然而，用一种舰载武器替换另一种舰载武器是比较简单的。这样做需要1天的工作和武器的安装费用。被拆除的武器可以保留在仓库里（尽管大多数都是巨大的重量和空间）或以一半的市场价值出售。",

	"Ships have a wide variety of systems at their disposal, expanding their capabilities and comforts, making them both powerful weapons and cozy homes. Ships have room to install three additional systems before space on board becomes a significant problem. However, fighter-sized ships have much tighter space, and have no room for additional systems. After the maximum number of systems are installed, new systems can only be installed by removing other systems from the ship.": "舰艇有各种各样的系统可供支配，扩大了它们的能力和舒适度，使它们既是强大的武器又是舒适的家。舰艇有空间安装三个额外的系统，在船上的空间成为一个重大问题之前。然而，战斗机大小的舰艇的空间要小得多，而且没有空间安装额外的系统。在安装了最大数量的系统后，新的系统只能通过从船上拆除其他系统来安装。",

You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so, any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.": "有时，你在舰对舰战斗中的目标需要你登上一艘敌对的船只。如果你的船有一个脐带，如果双方的船都在500英尺以内，并且你的船的驾驶员与对方的速度相匹配，你就可以登上另一艘船。当你这样做时，任何数量的船员或乘客都可以加入登船队伍。只要两艘船保持在500英尺的范围内，脐带就会保持连接。",
	"A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.": "登船队和任何有敌意的船员都会滚动他们自己的主动权，这与正在进行的船只战斗是平行的。作为登船队的战斗与正常的战斗是一样的。",
	"The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.": "登船队伍通过脐带到达一个房间，只能通过脐带返回自己的飞船。对方舰艇的舰长或工程师可以解除生命支持系统（或选择只解除重力、大气或热量），或启动舰艇的自毁计时器。此外，如果登船队伍进入了重要的位置，如引擎室、护盾发生器或放置飞船武器的战斗台，他们可以利用这个机会破坏或禁用飞船的各种系统和武器。",
	"If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.": "如果党派消灭了被登船的所有敌对船员，他们可以征用这艘船，只要他们有一个知识渊博的飞行员和足够的船员来操作它。",
	"The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.": "GM并不单独扮演NPC船的各个角色。相反，每艘NPC船都会滚动自己的主动权，并能在其回合中执行所有相关的行动。此外，NPC船不计算炮手的统计数据，而是使用武器条目中包含的攻击奖励，并且通常每种武器都有一个炮手。GM还可以决定NPC船员的相关能力检查和蓄力攻击。",
	"If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.": "如果NPC船有一个船长角色，GM也可以允许该船在其回合中采取额外的行动。",
	"Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship's explosion.": "大多数GM让NPC船在下降到0点时立即爆炸。常见的例外情况包括：一个或多个玩家角色登上了飞船，或者一个重要的NPC或反派在飞船上。另外，GM可以规定有关角色在飞船爆炸前不久乘坐救生舱或穿梭机逃跑。",
	"Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.": "舰船作战特别适合在基于方格的地图上使用微型模型。使用这一规则，每个方格是500英尺×500英尺，每艘船都面向其周围方格的侧面或角落。运输船大小或更小的船只适合在一个方格内。在它的回合中，一艘船每移动500英尺就会移动一个方格。",
	"When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.": "在网格上计算距离时，第一个对角线方格算作1个移动方格，第二个对角线方格算作2个方格。每当你在对角线上计数时，都要重复这种1格、2格的模式，即使你在不同的运动位之间进行水平或垂直移动。",
	"Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.": "虽然船舶战斗主要发生在二维平面上，但你可以使用这个变体规则将战斗转换为类似于三维空间的形式。当战斗开始时，GM决定有多少个运动平面存在。在开放空间，可能有三到四个，而在围绕恒星的轨道上，可能只有两个。",
	"When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.": "当你移动你的飞船时，你可以消耗1,000英尺的移动量来向上或向下移动一个移动平面（这样做也会使你在你的移动锥中向前移动500英尺）。当你以其他运动平面上的船只为目标时，它们会被视为在你的船和目标之间的每一个运动平面上都有额外的500英尺距离。两艘船可以在同一空间内，在不同的运动平面上，在彼此的上方或下方通过。",
	"It is impossible to underscore the vastness of space. Without a {@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engine}, even the most advanced civilizations the 'verse over would not have crossed the vast Black separating worlds, but with one, a ship can skip from nebula to nebula on a whim.": "不可能强调空间的广袤性。如果没有{@item Dark Matter Engine|darkmatter|Dark Matter engine}，即使是最先进的文明'se over也不会跨越分隔世界的巨大黑色，但有了它，一艘船可以随心所欲地从星云跳到星云。",
	"To cross the 'verse quickly, Dark Matter engines conduct their ships through the Void, an utterly incomprehensible dimension of singularity. The Void's hostile nature renders direct exposure to it untenable, and worse still, its strange radiation baffles navigational instruments. The safest means to perform a jump, therefore, is to lower thick protective shutters and jump nearly blind, with perhaps some assistance from powerful divination magic.": "为了快速穿越'诗篇'，暗物质引擎让他们的飞船穿过虚空，一个完全无法理解的奇异空间。虚空的敌对性质使得直接暴露在其中是不可行的，更糟糕的是，其奇怪的辐射使导航仪器感到困惑。因此，进行跳跃的最安全的方法是放下厚厚的保护性百叶窗，几乎是盲目地跳跃，也许有强大的占卜魔法的帮助。",
	"Travel by void jump isn't perfect, but it is a necessity; the flow of people and goods across the 'verse is borne by regular use of Dark Matter engines, so resourceful pilots have found a few ways to heighten the accuracy of their jumps. There are three principle types of void jump using a Dark matter engine: a blind jump, without navigational aide of any sort, an assisted jump, which uses recent star charts or the astrogation spell as a guide, or a maw jump, which translocates the ship from one maw to another, always without error.": "通过虚空跳跃旅行并不完美，但它是一种必需品；穿越'诗篇'的人员和货物流动是通过定期使用暗物质引擎来实现的，所以机智的飞行员已经找到一些方法来提高他们跳跃的准确性。使用暗物质引擎的虚空跳跃有三种主要类型：盲目跳跃，没有任何形式的导航辅助；辅助跳跃，使用最近的星图或天体探测法术作为指导；或大口跳跃，将飞船从一个大口转移到另一个大口，总是没有错误。",
	"An unassisted, or \"Blind,\" jump carries a significant risk. Often, it's preferable to assured death, but one can never be too sure when they will jump into a star, an asteroid field, or into a dangerous orbit around a black hole. When making a blind jump, the ship's pilot chooses a destination within range of the ship's jump distance and rolls on the Blind Jump table.": "无人协助的，或 \"盲目 \"的跳跃有很大的风险。通常情况下，这比有把握的死亡要好，但一个人永远不能太确定他们何时会跳入一颗恒星、一个小行星场，或者跳入一个围绕黑洞的危险轨道。当进行盲目跳跃时，飞船的驾驶员在飞船的跳跃距离范围内选择一个目的地，然后在盲目跳跃表上进行滚动。",
	"Your ship emerges dangerously close to a star or black hole. Your ship loses half of its HP and all its systems are reduced to 0 HP and disabled. Your ship can't perform a void jump until it is repaired with a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Technology|DarkMatter}) check and 1 hour of work. If the ship can't escape within an hour, it will be destroyed.": "你的飞船危险地接近一颗恒星或黑洞。你的飞船失去了一半的HP，它的所有系统都被降低到0HP并被禁用。你的飞船不能进行虚空跳跃，直到它被DC20智力（{@skill Technology|DarkMatter}）检查和1小时的工作所修复。如果飞船在一小时内不能逃脱，它将被摧毁。",
	"You are no closer to your destination.": "你没有更接近你的目的地。",
	"Your ship emerges from a turbulent jump with immense claw marks streaking down its hull. Your ship loses 25% of its HP (rounded down) and all its systems are reduced to 0 HP and disabled.": "你的飞船从湍急的跳跃中出现，船体上有巨大的爪痕划过。你的飞船失去了25%的HP（四舍五入），所有的系统都被降低到0HP并被禁用。",
	"You are no closer to your destination": "你没有更接近你的目的地",
	"Your ship encounters a concussive wave of energy by exiting the jump out of phase. Your ship loses half of its HP.": "你的飞船因跳出相位外而遇到了震荡波的能量。你的飞船失去了一半的HP。",
	"Intense waves of void radiation impact the outside of your ship and cook its insides. Each creature on the ship takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage and half the ship's weapons, rounded up, are reduced to 0 HP and disabled.": "强烈的虚空辐射波冲击你的飞船外部，并烤熟其内部。船上的每个生物都受到7({@damage 2d6})的火焰伤害，船上一半的武器(四舍五入)被降低到0HP并失效。",
	"Your ship emerges from its jump in deep space. You are up to 50% closer to your destination than you began.": "你的飞船从深空的跳跃中出现了。你离你的目的地比你开始时要近50%。",
	"Your void jump sends you wide of your intended target. At the GM's discretion, there is a 10% chance that you encounter an undiscovered planet, derelict spacecraft, spatial anomaly, or other significant location.": "你的虚空跳跃使你偏离了你的预定目标。由GM决定，你有10%的机会遇到一个未被发现的星球、废弃的航天器、空间异常点或其他重要地点。",
	"You are up to 50% closer to your destination than you began.": "你离你的目的地比你开始时最多接近50%。",
	"You are close enough to your target to reach it with 10 minutes of sublight travel.": "你离你的目标足够近，用10分钟的亚光速旅行就能到达它。",
	"Your ship emerges from the void jump precisely where you intend to, often near a spaceport or in orbit around a planet.": "你的飞船从虚空跳跃中出现的地方正是你打算去的地方，通常是在一个太空港附近或在一个星球周围的轨道上。",
	"Canny spacers have worked for centuries to circumvent the obstacles presented by the Void's strange radiation, and have come up with a few ways of doing so.": "聪明的太空人几个世纪以来一直在努力绕过虚空的奇怪辐射所带来的障碍，并想出了一些办法。",
	"Starfaring guilds have devised the means to integrate void jump data, gravitational scans, and planetary maps into {@b Star Charts}, downloadable data packages which ship computers can use to calculate rough jump trajectories. Though the ship still technically flies blind, it spends time before the jump simulating different jump results until it finds a generally safe course. This always takes one hour. Using a star chart for an assisted jump always places the ship near its intended target, close enough to reach the destination with 10 minutes of sublight travel.": "星际航行的行会已经设计出了将虚空跳跃数据、引力扫描和行星地图整合到{@b Star Charts}、可下载的数据包中的方法，飞船计算机可以用它来计算出粗略的跳跃轨迹。尽管飞船在技术上仍然是盲目飞行，但它在跳跃前会花时间模拟不同的跳跃结果，直到找到一个普遍安全的路线。这总是需要一个小时。使用星图进行辅助跳跃总是将飞船置于其预定的目标附近，近到可以用10分钟的亚光旅行到达目的地。",
	"Star charts become obsolete after about 18 months due to the shifting topology of space. A single chart allows transit to all the settled worlds in one territory, such as the Hegemony of Man or the Dwarven Conclave, but there are few, if any, charts to the Galactic Frontier. Moreover, a ship must be in good standing with a territory to gain access to its star charts, though large factions routinely circumvent this, offering charts to any ships in their employ.": "由于空间拓扑结构的变化，星图在大约18个月后就会被淘汰。一张星图可以让人前往一个地区的所有定居世界，例如人类霸权或矮人协约国，但很少有，甚至没有前往银河系边境的星图。此外，一艘船必须与一个领地保持良好的关系才能获得其星图，尽管大的派别经常规避这一点，向任何受雇于他们的船只提供星图。",
	"A cheaper alternative to purchasing a chart to an entire territory is to follow a specific route. Such routes are downloaded from existing flight data and calculated the same way as jumps using star charts, but only work from a specific starting point to a specific destination.": "与购买整个地区的海图相比，一个更便宜的选择是遵循一条特定的路线。这种路线是从现有的飞行数据中下载的，计算方法与使用星图的跳跃相同，但只从一个特定的起点到一个特定的目的地。",
	"Resourceful mages have created a powerful divination spell to discern some semblance of direction when performing a void jump: {@spell astrogation|darkmatter}. If the pilot of a ship performs a void jump while under the effect of this spell, they automatically make a perfect jump, arriving precisely where they intend to, often near a spaceport or in orbit around a planet.": "机智的法师创造了一个强大的占卜咒语，在进行虚空跳跃时可以辨别一些方向的迹象。{@spell astrogation|darkmatter}. 如果飞船的驾驶员在这个法术的作用下进行虚空跳跃，他们会自动进行一次完美的跳跃，准确地到达他们想要到达的地方，通常是在一个太空港附近或在一个星球的轨道上。",
	"Consuming a {@item roach|darkmatter} triggers a wave of euphoria and mind-expanding effects. Many pilots believe they can see the entire universe after consuming a roach, even though some see terrible visions of the Void. Consuming a roach grants a creature the benefits of the {@spell astrogation|darkmatter} spell: a perfect jump. Roaches are generally cheaper than hiring an astrogator, but long-term roach use is dangerous and addictive. See Roach Addiction in Appendix E for more information.": "消耗一只{@item roach|darkmatter}会引发一波欣快感和思维扩张的效果。许多飞行员相信他们在食用蟑螂后可以看到整个宇宙，尽管有些人看到的是虚空的可怕幻象。摄取蟑螂可以让生物获得{@spell astrogation|darkmatter}法术的好处：完美的跳跃。蟑螂一般比雇佣天体探测器要便宜，但长期使用蟑螂是危险的，而且会上瘾。更多信息见附录E中的蟑螂成瘾。",
	"A maw jump carries no miss chance; any ship capable of performing a void jump can travel from one maw to the next without rolling on the Blind Jump table. Ships can only travel between adjacent maws in the network.": "盲跳没有失误的机会；任何能够进行虚空跳跃的飞船都可以从一个盲跳到下一个盲跳，而不需要在盲跳表中进行滚动。舰船只能在网络中相邻的巨口之间旅行。",
	"Whereas the maw stations in the center of the galaxy are extremely reliable, the outermost stations on the Galactic Frontier are a different matter entirely. Making a jump to a station on the outer ring is a one-way trip; you can't jump back from the outer ring via a maw station. Additionally, maws on the outer ring have only intermittent connection between themselves: when you arrive at a new maw station on the outer ring, there is a 25% chance that an outgoing connection to an adjacent maw is disabled and won't be restored for at least 7 days.": "银河系中心的马口站非常可靠，而银河系边境的最外层站则完全是另一回事。跃迁到外环上的站点是一个单程旅行；你不能通过马口站从外环跳回来。此外，外环上的马口站之间只有断断续续的连接：当你到达外环上的一个新马口站时，有25%的机会与相邻的马口站之间的出站连接被禁用，而且至少7天内不会恢复。",
	"When a pilot wants to travel within a star system, such as between a planet and its moon or between two planets, without initiating a void jump, they can achieve a cruising speed by accelerating in a straight line for 1 minute. While traveling at cruising speeds, the ship's speed increases to a maximum of 1/20th the speed of light, and it can make only gradual course corrections. The ship requires 1 minute to safely decelerate. A ship of Frigate size or larger takes 10 minutes to accelerate or decelerate.": "当飞行员想在一个恒星系统内旅行时，例如在一个行星和它的卫星之间或两个行星之间，而不启动虚空跳跃，他们可以通过直线加速1分钟来达到巡航速度。在以巡航速度行驶时，飞船的速度最多增加到光速的1/20，它只能进行渐进的航线修正。该船需要1分钟来安全减速。一艘护卫舰大小的飞船需要10分钟来加速或减速。",
	"When exploring the Frontier worlds of the 'verse, it's a good idea to learn more about a planet before entering its atmosphere. A planet might look harmless, but you might discover upon touching down that its atmosphere is poisonous or its \"water\" is actually liquid carbon dioxide. For this reason, most ships' come equipped with a complex planetary scanning system, designed to inform their crew about a planet from a safe distance.": "在探索边疆世界的时候，在进入一个星球的大气层之前，最好能多了解一下这个星球。一个星球可能看起来无害，但你可能在着陆后发现它的大气层是有毒的，或者它的 \"水 \"实际上是液体二氧化碳。出于这个原因，大多数飞船都配备了一个复杂的行星扫描系统，旨在从一个安全的距离告知其船员关于一个星球的情况。",
	"While you are in the Captain role of a ship with functional {@item sensors|darkmatter}, you can spend 1 hour to conduct an in-depth scan of a planet within your sensors' range to learn its basic geography and composition. If you spend 8 hours conducting a scan, you also learn any of the planet's major environmental hazards, such as high gravity, a poisonous atmosphere, or volcanic activity. If you spend 24 hours conducting a planetary scan, you also learn whether the planet's surface is inhabited, what general level of technology said inhabitants seem to possess (by detecting the presence of bronze, iron, steel, uranium, etc.), and its weather patterns over the next 24 hours.": "当你在一艘有功能（%0%）的飞船上担任船长时，你可以花1小时对你传感器范围内的星球进行深入扫描，以了解它的基本地理和组成。如果你花8小时进行扫描，你还可以了解该星球的任何主要环境危险，如高重力、有毒的大气层或火山活动。如果你花24小时进行一次行星扫描，你还可以了解该星球的表面是否有人居住，这些居民似乎拥有什么样的技术水平（通过检测青铜、铁、钢、铀等的存在），以及未来24小时的天气模式。",
	"Occasionally, one or more of a planet's traits may prevent you from learning more about it. For example, a thick, cloudy atmosphere may prevent you from examining the planet's geography or learning about any inhabitants, or a strong arcano-magnetic field might disrupt the scan entirely.": "偶尔，一个星球的一个或多个特征可能会妨碍你对它的了解。例如，厚重、多云的大气层可能使你无法检查该星球的地理状况或了解任何居民，或者一个强大的弧形磁场可能会完全破坏扫描。",
	"If your ship is equipped with a {@vehicle probe|darkmatter}, you can plunge it into the planet's atmosphere to get a closer look, potentially circumventing obstacles which prevent you from learning about the planet. Doing so allows you to gain a full 24-hour scan of the planet in 1 hour, but destroys the probe in the process.": "如果你的飞船配备了{@vehicle probe|darkmatter}，你可以把它投入到星球的大气层中去仔细观察，有可能绕过阻碍你了解这个星球的障碍。这样做可以让你在1小时内对该星球进行24小时的全面扫描，但在此过程中会毁掉探测器。",
	"Information gained from planetary scans are stored on your ship's computer and can be later sold to interested parties, such as Astrogations Inc. Such payment is usually based on the planet's tier of habitability, with superior planets (at lower tiers) paying best, and special bonuses for rare finds, such as Tier X worlds.": "从行星扫描中获得的信息储存在你的飞船电脑中，以后可以卖给感兴趣的人，如Astrogations公司。这种支付通常是基于行星的可居住性等级，高级行星（较低的等级）的支付是最好的，而对于罕见的发现，如X级世界，则有特别的奖励。",
	"In between the maw jumps, blind jumps, narrow escapes from the authorities, and broadsides delivered into an unfortunate spaceshark, the three thieves had ample time to plan their raid on Garfreckt's hoard. All that remained was to plant the distraction, sneak into the treasure cave, and make a clean getaway.": "在大口跳跃、盲目跳跃、从当局手中险些逃脱，以及向一只不幸的太空鲨发射宽幅子弹之间，这三个小偷有足够的时间来计划对加弗莱克特的囤积物进行突袭。剩下的就是分散注意力，潜入藏宝洞，然后干净利落地逃走。",
	"It did not take long at all for things to go awry. Mere seconds after their arrival in Garfreckt's asteroid field, the dragon appeared on the sensor screens, an ominous rendering of wings and horns perched atop an asteroid, and a fearsome growl filled the vacuum of space. \"You fools think to rob me? Ha! Preposterous! I am Garfreckt, the Eternal Dragon!! And I can smell your humanoid stink from light years away.\"": "没过多久，事情就出了岔子。在他们到达加弗莱克特的小行星领域后仅几秒钟，龙就出现在传感器屏幕上，一个不祥的翅膀和角的渲染，栖息在一颗小行星上，可怕的咆哮声充满了太空的真空。\"你们这些傻瓜想抢劫我？太荒谬了! 我是加弗莱克特，永恒的龙！! 而且我在光年之外就能闻到你们人类的臭味。\"",

	"Mekhet-Nu composed himself. \"To fire such a weapon... it is a weighty thing, even if there's no one nearby to be caught in the blast. At least allow me a moment to reflect.\" The monk paused for several seconds, exhaled, then pressed the button.": "Mekhet-Nu整理了一下自己。\"发射这样的武器......这是一件很重的事情，即使附近没有人被卷入爆炸。至少让我有时间思考一下。\" 和尚停顿了几秒钟，呼了口气，然后按下了按钮。",
	"Nano and Mekhet-Nu sat on a silent bridge for what seemed like an eternity. They looked at each other, expressions blank. Both were starting to reach for their controls when the shockwave hit; the massive discharge of energy making waves in the very fabric of reality. Hurled from their seats, they were surprised to find themselves floating up to the ceiling, the artificial gravity temporarily disabled.": "纳诺和Mekhet-Nu坐在寂静的桥上，似乎有很长一段时间了。他们互相看着对方，表情茫然。当冲击波袭来时，两人都开始伸手去拿他们的控制器；巨大的能量释放在现实的结构中产生了波浪。他们被从座位上推开，惊讶地发现自己漂浮在天花板上，人工重力暂时失效。",
	"Mekhet-Nu reacted fastest, whirling around in mid-air and catapulting himself off the ceiling and back to his station. \"Rami!\" He barked into the intercom. \"Damage report!

	"\"On it,\" she replied. \"Uh, this might take a while. Try not to breathe too much...\"": "\"正在办，\"她回答。\"呃，这可能需要一些时间。尽量不要呼吸太多......\"",
	"\"Can do!\" Nano chirped, now back in the captain's chair. The next message went out to Garfreckt: \"So how do you like that, dragon? We've got plenty more where that came from!\"": "\"能行！\" 纳诺鸣叫着，现在又回到了船长的位置上。下一条信息是发给加弗莱克特的：\"那么你喜欢这个吗，龙？我们还有很多东西要做！\"",
	"A furious hissing was the only response, as the thieves watched Garfreckt retreat behind an asteroid for cover.": "愤怒的嘶嘶声是唯一的回应，因为盗贼们看着加弗莱克特退到一颗小行星后面作掩护。",

	"As they closed on their goal, Rami appeared on the bridge, filthy and reeking of ozone. \"I've done all I can. Fabricator and arcane cannon are fried. Life support is busted too, but I've managed to rig the air filter up so we won't suffocate. At least, for a while. Also, while I was down there, I noticed that the antivirus module on the computer seems to be overheating...

	"This chapter includes a large selection of monsters that can be encountered throughout the verse, followed by a selection of NPCs that might be used to populate your maws, hearthstations, and crews.": "这一章包括在整个诗篇中可以遇到的大量怪物，然后是可能用于填充你的大嘴、灵堂和船员的NPC的选择。",
	"The constructs and alien beasts found on expeditions to the farthest reaches of space have unique traits never seen in terrestrial creatures.": "在最遥远的太空探险中发现的构造物和外星兽类具有在陆地生物中从未见过的独特特征。",
	"Dark Matter introduces a new size category, larger even than Gargantuan: Mega. Creatures of Mega size will always have the Mega Creature trait, which will elaborate on its dimensions. Some Mega creatures occupy a 500-by-500-foot space (only one square using the Rule of 100), while others can be as large as a 2000-by-2000-foot space. Generally, Mega creatures will possess mega hit points, deal mega damage, and will have movement and senses reaching thousands of feet, to match their scale.": "黑暗物质 \"引入了一个新的尺寸类别，甚至比 \"巨无霸 \"更大。巨型。巨型生物总是具有巨型生物的特征，这将详细说明其尺寸。一些巨型生物占据了500乘500英尺的空间（使用100法则只占一个平方），而另一些则可以大到2000乘2000英尺的空间。一般来说，巨型生物会拥有超强的命中率，造成超强的伤害，并且会有数千英尺的移动和感知能力，以配合它们的规模。",
	"Mega creatures can't be summoned, and non-mega creatures can't transform into them.": "巨型生物不能被召唤，非巨型生物也不能转化为它们。",
	"Slaying one of these creatures is no task for terrestrial adventurers; they are best combated using ships, tanks, and warheads. Even the smallest Mega creatures can pose a profound threat to entire worlds.": "对于陆地上的冒险者来说，杀死这些生物并不是什么任务；它们最好用飞船、坦克和弹头来对付。即使是最小的巨型生物也能对整个世界构成深刻的威胁。",
	"A monster with {@sense thermalsight|DarkMatter} can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog. The monster can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, the monster can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. Many constructs have this special sense.": "拥有{@sense thermalsight|DarkMatter}的怪物可以通过黑暗和严重遮蔽的条件，例如雾，看到活的生物。怪物还可以通过体温来判断一个生物是生是死。然而，该怪物不能辨别颜色，也不能用这种感觉看穿幻觉、隐形或魔法黑暗。这种感觉会被一英寸的任何固体障碍物所阻挡。许多结构体都有这种特殊的感觉。",
	"The {@spell find familiar|darkmatter} spell provides a comfortable number of options to arcanists, but many spellcasters are eager to summon more exotic companions with the spell. With the GM's permission, a spellcaster can summon any of the following monsters as a familiar: a {@creature mechanical spider|darkmatter}, a {@creature psi-worm|darkmatter}, a {@creature software bug|darkmatter}, a {@creature thwirrel|darkmatter}, or a {@creature wizmo|darkmatter}.": "{@spell find familiar|darkmatter}法术为奥术师提供了舒适的选择，但许多施法者渴望用该法术召唤出更多奇特的同伴。在GM的允许下，施法者可以召唤以下任何怪物作为熟悉的人：一个（1%），一个（2%），一个（3%），一个（4%），或一个（5%）。",
	"The following table lists the monsters included in this book by challenge rating.": "下表按挑战等级列出了本书收录的怪物。",
	"The 'verse is home to such a variety of life that much of it defies classification. Though many types of alien creatures appear to share throughlines in shape and function, they are outnumbered by the remarkable and utterly unique creatures found on nearly every world. Each habitable world demands unique adaptations, and through complex chains of evolution, sometimes assisted by magic, they can become inhabited by truly bizarre creatures.": "宇宙中的生命种类繁多，很多都无法分类。尽管许多类型的外星生物在形状和功能上似乎都有共同点，但它们的数量要比在几乎每个世界上发现的非凡和完全独特的生物多。每个可居住的世界都需要独特的适应性，通过复杂的进化链，有时在魔法的帮助下，它们可以成为真正奇怪的生物的居住地。",
	"As completely alien as these creatures might seem, they are no more than ordinary beasts on their homeworlds; by contrast, monstrosities and aberrations lie outside this natural framework altogether.": "尽管这些生物可能看起来完全陌生，但它们在自己的家园不过是普通的野兽；相比之下，怪兽和畸形人完全不在这个自然框架之内。",
	"No matter how strange an alien beast might be, adventurers and explorers are likely to refer to them by analogy to things they understand. Descriptions like 'an alligator with a giraffe's neck and a whale's body' are not uncommon. For some alien beasts, these analogies aren't far off; some appear merely like discolored or missized versions of familiar animals. Others, however, are far more exotic. It's difficult to describe the floating ooze-fungus beasts of Nix, for example, without mentioning how their three long legs resemble the arms of a praying mantis, but translucent and many times their size.": "无论外星野兽多么奇怪，冒险家和探险家都可能通过与他们了解的事物进行类比来描述它们。像 \"长颈鹿的脖子和鲸鱼的身体的鳄鱼 \"这样的描述并不少见。对于一些外星动物来说，这些类比并不遥远；有些看起来只是像熟悉的动物的变色或错误大小的版本。然而，其他的则要奇特得多。例如，如果不提它们的三条长腿如何类似于螳螂的手臂，就很难描述尼克斯的漂浮物--真菌兽，但它们是半透明的，而且大小是它们的数倍。",
	"The animals and plants of distant worlds are much like terrestrial creatures and retain the same statistics, except as noted below:": "遥远世界的动物和植物很像陆地上的生物，并保留相同的统计数据，除了下面提到的情况。",

	"The alien beast can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) force damage if it ends the turn inside an object.": "异兽可以在其他生物和物体中移动，就像它们是困难地形一样。如果它在一个物体内结束回合，则会受到5（（%0%））的武力伤害。",
	"The alien beast can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.": "外星野兽可以爬上困难的表面，包括倒立在天花板上，而不需要进行能力检查。",
	"This section contains statistics for nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventures might encounter when traveling across the 'verse, including lowly crewmen and deadly space marines.

	"Nano rolled out of the stasis bubble, leaking strange fluids from a dozen fractured body parts. It was a struggle just to get the cap off the healing potions, let alone drink them, but Nano ignored the screaming pain signals and pushed through.": "纳诺从死气沉沉的气泡中滚了出来，从十几个断裂的身体部位渗出奇怪的液体。光是把治疗药水的盖子拿下来就很费劲，更不用说喝了，但纳诺不顾疼痛信号的尖叫，硬是挺了过来。",
	"More potions revived Rami and Mekhet-Nu, but all three were still groggy and disoriented when the sound of blaster fire erupted nearby. Dragonborn fighters were descending on all sides, gliding through the low-gravity environment with practiced grace—these were obviously Scale & Fang elites, Garfreckt's personal bodyguards.": "更多的药水使拉米和梅克特-努恢复了活力，但当附近爆发的爆破枪声响起时，这三个人仍然昏昏沉沉，不知所措。龙裔战士从四面八方赶来，在低重力环境中滑行，动作娴熟优雅--这些人显然是鳞片和獠牙的精英，加弗雷克特的私人保镖。",
	"The three of them forced their aching bodies into action, pushing back the first wave of dragonborn for the price of a haste spell and a salvo of tiny missiles. As they neared the treasure vault, another dragonborn ambusher broke cover to attack.": "他们三个人强迫他们疼痛的身体行动起来，以一个急速咒语和一连串小导弹的代价击退了第一波龙族。当他们接近宝库时，另一个龙裔伏击者打破掩体进行攻击。",
	"\"Stand back: this one's mine!\" The wizard leapt up, bowling her target over. He scrabbled for his blaster, but it had already floated nearly ten feet into the air. Eyes fixed on her supine foe, Rami shouted her verbal components, conjuring three massive fists of glowing force. The barrage of strikes slammed home, crushing armor and bone alike.": "\"退后：这个人是我的！\" 巫师一跃而起，把她的目标打翻在地。他拼命寻找他的爆破器，但它已经飘到了近10英尺的空中。拉米眼睛盯着她仰卧的敌人，喊出了她的语言组件，变出了三只发光的巨大拳头。这一连串的攻击猛烈地击中了目标，将盔甲和骨头都击碎了。",
	"Rami led Mekhet-Nu and Nano through a narrow tunnel, cutting off pursuit with a hasty casting of stone shape. At the tunnel's end, they came to a sealed bulkhead door; the wizard needed only to knock and the passageway opened into Garfreckt's treasure room.": "拉米带领梅克特-努和纳诺穿过一条狭窄的隧道，用匆忙投下的石头形状切断了追兵。在隧道的尽头，他们来到一扇密封的隔板门前；巫师只需敲一下，通道就会打开，进入加弗雷克特的藏宝室。",
	"Filling most of the asteroid's internal space, the hoard seemed to shine with auric light. Jewel-encrusted statues and gargantuan paintings lent a smattering of color to the golden backdrop, with countless technological wonders nestled among the piles of coin.": "填充了小行星的大部分内部空间，这些囤积物似乎闪耀着灵光。镶嵌着宝石的雕像和巨大的画作给金色的背景增添了一丝色彩，无数的技术奇迹依偎在成堆的硬币中。",
	"\"There, that's the Blaster Prototype!\" Mekhet-Nu pointed to a pedestal in the center of the room. He set off towards it at a sprint but Garfreckt's voice flooded into the room.": "\"那里，那是爆破手原型！\" Mekhet-Nu指着房间中央的一个基座。他以冲刺的速度向它出发，但加弗莱克特的声音涌入房间。",
	"\"ENOUGH!!\" He raged, sending the thieves to the ground by the sheer force of his will. \"NONE OF YOU WILL LEAVE HERE ALIVE!!\"": "\"够了！！\" 他怒气冲冲，用他的意志力把盗贼们打倒在地。\"你们谁也别想活着离开这里！！\"",
	"The dragon smashed a claw through the ceiling of the chamber, puncturing the vacuum seal and disrupting whatever spell or device was generating the asteroid's artificial gravity. Billions of coins scattered in every direction as the air began to rush, howling, out of the room.": "这条龙用爪子砸破了房间的天花板，刺破了真空密封，破坏了产生小行星人工重力的任何咒语或装置。数以亿计的硬币散落在各个方向，空气开始冲出房间，发出嚎叫。",
	"Mekhet-Nu, desperation in his eyes, lunged for the Prototype, propelled by his ki in a colossal leap forward.

	"...And a metallic thump as he hit the deck of a ship? The tightness receded, and Rami stepped away from her comrade. \"Man, that was close. You are one lucky duckling, Mek.\"": "......当他撞上船的甲板时，还发出金属的砰砰声？紧绷的感觉退去了，拉米从她的战友身边走过。\"伙计，真险啊。你是一只幸运的小鸭子，梅克。\"",

	"\"The wizard conjured us a 'Telaros' terrific transport,'\" said Nano's distinctive voice. \"Though we'd never have been able to pick you up without my jetpack.

	"Rami and Nano, blindsided by the presence of these unexpected allies, handed the comms to the avia-ra without another word.": "拉米和纳诺被这些突如其来的盟友吓了一跳，没有再说话就把通讯器交给了阿维亚拉。",

	"Mega spells possess immense scale and ruinous power, making them ideal for theaters of space combat. However, their construction is fragile, causing them to collapse harmlessly whenever any part of the spell's effect would intersect with an area of gravity, such as on a planet, moon, or asteroid, or in an area of artificial gravity, such as within a ship. A mega spell can be cast from inside an area of gravity or artificial gravity, as long as its effect lies solely outside the area. These spells are marked with the (mega) tag.": "巨型法术拥有巨大的规模和毁灭的力量，使它们成为太空作战的理想选择。然而，它们的结构是脆弱的，只要咒语效果的任何部分与重力区域相交，如在行星、月球或小行星上，或在人工重力区域，如在飞船内，就会无害地崩溃。一个巨型法术可以在重力区域或人工重力区域内施放，只要其效果只在该区域之外。这些法术被标记为（mega）标签。",
	"If a spellcaster that is concentrating on a mega spell is within a ship or a large structure when that object takes damage, the spellcaster must make a concentration check as if they took an amount of damage equal to the number of mega points of damage taken by the object.": "如果一个正在专注于巨型法术的施法者在船舶或大型建筑内，当该物体受到伤害时，施法者必须进行专注度检查，就像他们受到的伤害等于该物体受到的巨型点数的伤害。",

	"Though teleportation magic seems limitless for terrestrial applications, it falls woefully short on a galactic scale. Spells that instantaneously move creatures hundreds of miles, such as teleport, don't penetrate far into the Black. Therefore, any such spell fails if the target location is further than one million miles from its origin. Spells such as gate or plane shift can't circumvent this limit, either, since leaving and returning to the Material Plane moves very little distance through space.": "尽管传送魔法在陆地上的应用似乎是无限的，但在银河系的范围内，它却显得非常不足。瞬间移动生物几百英里的法术，如传送，并不能深入到黑域。因此，如果目标地点离它的起点超过一百万英里，任何此类法术都会失败。诸如门或平面转移之类的法术也无法绕过这个限制，因为离开和返回物质界在空间中移动的距离非常小。",
	"These spells are presented in alphabetical order. Mega spells are noted in parentheses.": "这些法术是按字母顺序排列的。大型法术在括号中注明。",
	"A wild cheer went up in the cantina. \"A round for my adoring fans!\" Rami waved her datapad, full of credits, in the direction of the bartender.": "酒馆里响起了一阵狂热的欢呼。\"为我的崇拜者来一轮！\" 拉米向酒保的方向挥舞着她的数据板，上面写满了信用额度。",

	"\"Okay, but how did you get away from the asteroid?\" Came the immediate response. \"Your shuttle wouldn't have lasted six seconds against the dragon.\"": "\"好吧，但你是怎么离开小行星的？\" 立即得到了回应。\"你的航天飞机在面对巨龙时连六秒钟都坚持不了。\"",
	"\"You can thank him for that,\" she pointed at Mekhet-Nu, seated at the other end of the bar. \"Turns out he'd got in touch with some of his disciples ahead of time.

	"\"I did not expect such petulant behavior!\" The weapon, of course, said nothing. It was in one of its sulky moods today. Mekhet-Nu adopted a parental tone.": "\"我没有想到会有这样的撒娇行为！\" 武器，当然，什么也没说。它今天正处于它的一种生闷气的情绪中。Mekhet-Nu采用了一种家长式的语气。",
	"\"Young miss, are you not the legendary Prototype, first of all blasters?\" The weapon's arcane engine revved, emitting bright blue exhaust from two ports like piercing eyes.": "\"小姑娘，你不是传说中的原型机，所有爆破手中的第一人吗？\" 武器的奥术引擎转动起来，从两个像刺眼的端口发出明亮的蓝色废气。",
	"\"Do you not possess terrific power?\" Again, the weapon unleashed a wild torrent of fire, this time scorching a training dummy to ash.": "\"你不拥有可怕的力量吗？\" 武器再次释放出疯狂的火焰，这次把一个训练用的假人烧成了灰。",
	"\"Then why won't you yield?\" said the avia-ra, aggravation cracking his usual stony demeanor. Defiant, the blaster belched forth a wave of exhaust gas.": "\"那你为什么不屈服呢？\"阿维亚拉说，他一贯严肃的神情中出现了委屈的情绪。挑衅的是，爆破手喷出了一波废气。",
	"Mekhet-Nu took a deep breath to center himself. The Blaster Prototype was not only alive, but downright tempestuous. Yet he had patience in droves. More importantly, he had no other options. When the High Priests of the Sun came for him, he and the Prototype would have to be ready.": "Mekhet-Nu深深地吸了一口气，让自己集中精力。爆破手原型不仅是活着，而且是彻头彻尾的暴躁。然而他有成群的耐心。更重要的是，他没有其他选择。当太阳大祭司来找他时，他和原型机必须做好准备。",
	"\"Almost... there...\" Nano groaned, leveraging the wrenchinator with all possible weight. As the bolt gave way, the entire chassis clunked into place and circuits sprung to life. Dragon's fire rushed outward from the breastplate, ejecting spouts of flame at every bolt and joint. As the flames reached the golem's extremities, its hands clenched and its head turned to see its creator.": "\"几乎......到了......\" 纳诺呻吟着，用所有可能的重量撬动扳钳。当螺栓松动时，整个底盘哐当一声就到位了，电路也活了起来。龙的火焰从胸甲向外冲出，在每个螺栓和关节处喷射出火焰。当火焰到达巨像的四肢时，它的双手紧握，头转向看它的创造者。",
	"Nano was surprised that the trinket stolen from the dragon's hoard even fit, but dumbfounded to see it working. After all, the inside of the golem was now more vent tape than circuitry.": "纳诺对从龙的囤积物中偷来的饰品竟然适用感到惊讶，但看到它在工作时又感到茫然失措。毕竟，巨魔的内部现在更多的是通风带而不是电路。",
	"\"Welcome to the 'verse, Mac!\" Nano knocked once on the golem's chest to hear the satisfying clunk. This was the gadget to end all gadgets! Should probably build some legs for it, though.": "\"欢迎来到'诗篇'，麦克！\" 纳诺在石像的胸部敲了一下，听到了令人满意的 \"哐当 \"声。这就是所有小工具中的佼佼者! 不过，也许应该为它造一些腿。",

Humanoid settlement is limited to a handful of fortified outposts—mainly in mountains and other easily-defensible terrain—at least until the curse can be lifted.": "这个星球上的野生动物被一个恶魔的诅咒所折磨，导致动物变得更大、更凶猛地进攻。至少在诅咒被解除之前，人形生物的居住地仅限于少数强化的前哨--主要是在山区和其他容易防御的地形。",
	"The air here is thin and unwelcoming, meaning that this planet cannot sustain animal life without either technological or magical breathing apparatus. What buildings there are will be either airtight gnomish bunkers or else protected by a hallow spell.": "这里的空气稀薄且不受欢迎，这意味着如果没有技术或魔法呼吸装置，这个星球无法维持动物生命。这里的建筑要么是密不透风的地精碉堡，要么是由神圣的咒语保护。",
	"Orbiting a binary star, this planet suffers from long, hot days with only the briefest of nights in which to gain some respite. Those who can adapt their sleeping patterns, however, are able to enjoy a complex calendar of solstices, perihelions, and apogees that grants great power to druids and plentiful inspiration for bards.": "这颗行星围绕着一颗双子星运行，白天漫长而炎热，只有最短暂的夜晚才能获得一些喘息的机会。然而，那些能够适应他们的睡眠模式的人，能够享受到由至阴点、近阴点和远阴点组成的复杂的日历，赋予德鲁伊以巨大的力量，给吟游诗人以丰富的灵感。",

	"This planet is tidally-locked—that is to say, the same side of it always faces its star—causing extremely hot temperatures on one side, and bitterly cold temperatures on the other. Its atmosphere is also extremely thin, which accentuates the temperature gradient, and places another considerable hurdle in the way of survival.": "这颗行星是潮汐锁定的--也就是说，它的同一面总是面对着它的恒星--导致一边的温度极高，而另一边的温度极低。它的大气层也非常稀薄，这加剧了温度梯度，并在生存的道路上设置了另一个相当大的障碍。",
	"The very chemical nature of this planet is hostile; its atmosphere is toxic to almost all living things (with the exception of certain insects), and it's also corrosive to specific metals and alloys. A ship entering the atmosphere might dissolve completely, or only lose a few critical nuts and bolts, depending on its composition. Moreover, the planet has a considerable amount of liquid water, but all of it is laden with dissolved metals, which must be filtered extensively before consumption.": "这个星球的化学性质是敌对的；它的大气层对几乎所有的生物都是有毒的（某些昆虫除外），而且它对特定的金属和合金也有腐蚀性。一艘进入大气层的飞船可能会完全溶解，或者只失去一些关键的螺母和螺栓，这取决于它的成分。此外，这个星球有相当数量的液态水，但所有的水都充满了溶解的金属，在饮用前必须进行广泛的过滤。",
	"This world, as well as the others in its system, are newborns, only recently solidified from clumps of molten metal into true terrestrial bodies. Every inch of its surface is a rocky desert, blasted by windstorms and scorched by frequent volcanic eruptions. Perhaps it will be quite habitable in a billion years, but until then, it is a desolate, evershifting, lifeless wasteland.": "这个世界，以及它的系统中的其他世界，都是新生儿，最近才从一团熔化的金属凝结成真正的陆地体。它表面的每一寸土地都是岩石沙漠，被暴风吹拂，被频繁的火山喷发烧焦。也许10亿年后它会相当适合居住，但在那之前，它是一片荒凉的、不断变化的、没有生命的荒地。",
	"This rogue world was once ejected from its home system, and now flies aimlessly through the lifeless Black. It is a frozen ball of rock, bitterly cold, even on a cosmological scale.": "这个流氓世界曾经被从它的母星系统中弹出，现在漫无目的地在没有生命的黑子中飞翔。它是一个冰冻的岩石球，即使在宇宙学规模上也是严寒的。",
	"With liquid water, suitable farmland, and moderate temperatures, this planet would undoubtedly be suitable as a Tier 2 or Tier 3 world, that is, were it not for the {@b mega tarrasque} (as per the tarrasque statistics, but Mega sized, occupying a 2,000 × 2,000 ft. square, with mega hit points, dealing mega damage, capable of swallowing any creature or ship that can fit within a 1,000-ft. square). A creature of unimaginable power and ferocity, it roams this planet, slaughtering anyone who steps foot on it. Powerful spells, orbital bombardments, and even arcane warheads have been rained down upon it, to no effect.": "拥有液态水、合适的农田和适中的温度，这个星球无疑适合作为二级或三级世界，也就是说，如果不是因为{@b mega tarrasque}（根据塔拉斯克的统计数据，但体积巨大，占据2000×2000英尺的正方形，拥有巨大的命中率，造成巨大的伤害，能够吞噬任何能够在1000英尺范围内的生物或飞船）。一个具有难以想象的力量和凶猛的生物，它在这个星球上游荡，屠杀任何踏足它的人。强大的法术、轨道轰炸，甚至是奥术弹头都被倾泻到它身上，但都没有效果。",
	"Though it has been perhaps a thousand years since anything crawled across this planet's surface, its face is still marred by its last foolish inhabitants. The remnants of civilization here have long since crumbled away, but one thing is evidently clear: those who lived here managed to create an arsenal of arcane warheads, including one large enough to take a chunk out of the planet visible from space. There is no water here anymore, and little atmosphere. Dead magic pockets litter the world where the bombs detonated; the only remaining monument to the civilization's folly.": "尽管自从有东西爬过这个星球的表面以来，也许已经过去了一千年，但它的面孔仍然被它最后的愚蠢的居民所破坏。这里的文明残余早已崩溃，但有一件事显然是清楚的：那些住在这里的人设法创造了一个奥秘的弹头库，包括一个大到足以从太空中看到这个星球的大块。这里已经没有水了，大气层也很少。炸弹引爆的地方到处都是死亡的魔法口袋；这是文明的愚蠢的唯一剩余的纪念碑。",
	"At first blush, this world appears to be an undiscovered Tier 2, or even Tier 1, world. It is lush with life, and its surface is covered by jungles brimming with mega-trees. However, an uneasy silence meets any traveler here—despite abundant plant life, there are no animals to speak of; no birds, no fish, and no scurrying rodents. The only other living things are microorganisms—extremely dangerous ones at that. Any animal that is exposed directly to any part of this planet is sure to die from its diseases within a day.": "乍一看，这个世界似乎是一个未被发现的二级世界，甚至是一级世界。它生命力旺盛，其表面被充满巨型树木的丛林所覆盖。然而，一种不安的寂静迎接着任何旅行者--尽管有丰富的植物生命，却没有任何动物可言；没有鸟，没有鱼，也没有窜动的啮齿动物。唯一的其他生物是微生物，而且是极其危险的微生物。任何直接暴露在这个星球的任何部分的动物，肯定会在一天内死于疾病。",
	"A sinister presence plagues this planet. Little more than a barren rock with a breathable atmosphere, it is otherwise simply lifeless, but those who remain on it too long discover that the entire world is connected to the Lower Planes and is replete with infernal power. By degrees, the planet drains the life-force of its residents, visiting them with nightmares and hallucinations which grow more frequent and more intense with time. At last, those on the planet go violently insane or merely wither away.": "一个邪恶的存在困扰着这个星球。它只不过是一块荒芜的岩石，拥有可呼吸的大气层，除此之外没有任何生命，但那些在上面停留太久的人发现，整个世界与下层世界相连，充满了地狱般的力量。随着时间的推移，这个星球耗尽了居民的生命力，他们的噩梦和幻觉越来越频繁，越来越强烈。最后，这颗星球上的人要么暴躁地疯掉，要么只是枯萎。",
	"A type of living crystal has taken root on this world, resulting in a dazzling spectacle of glass deserts and diamond-spike gardens that cover most of the world. Unfortunately, the crystal is extremely lethal to living creatures, crystallizing and spreading inside an exposed creature's blood, killing it in mere minutes.": "一种活的水晶已经在这个世界上生根发芽，形成了玻璃沙漠和钻石穗花园的耀眼景象，覆盖了世界的大部分地区。不幸的是，这种水晶对生物极为致命，它会在暴露的生物的血液中结晶和扩散，在短短几分钟内杀死它。",

	"This planet's star periodically releases massive bursts of radiation. No amount of magic can shield someone caught in one of these ion storms; the only hope is to retreat deep underground when they occur. Consequently, any kind of meaningful agriculture and colonization is impossible.": "这个星球的恒星会定期释放大量的辐射。任何魔法都无法保护被卷入这些离子风暴中的人；唯一的希望是在它们发生时退到地下深处。因此，任何有意义的农业和殖民化都是不可能的。",

	"This planet orbits close to its parent star, creating an almost binary system. In addition to being massive and uninhabitable, it is also incomprehensibly hot.": "这颗行星紧紧围绕着它的母星运行，形成了一个几乎是双星的系统。除了质量大、不适合居住外，它的温度也令人难以理解。",
	"Dark and bitterly cold, this gas giant orbits far from its star on a strange plane of motion, as if it were captured from another system long ago. Though its atmosphere contains a number of rare metals not found elsewhere in its system, it also contains a number of compounds that can eat away at a ship's hull.": "这颗气态巨行星黑暗而严寒，在一个奇怪的运动平面上远离其恒星运行，仿佛是很久以前从另一个系统捕获的。虽然它的大气层中含有一些在其系统中其他地方没有的稀有金属，但它也含有一些可以侵蚀船体的化合物。",
	"This planet emits a field of arcane flux, which alternates between strengthening and destroying magic energy. The ship's Dark Matter engine and all of its magically-powered instruments malfunction every five to six seconds.": "这个星球发出一个奥术通量场，它在加强和破坏魔法能量之间交替进行。这艘船的暗物质引擎和所有以魔法为动力的仪器每隔五到六秒就会发生故障。",

	"For unknown reasons, this planet, which emits a high-pitched buzzing on all lines of communication, has a twisted vector of gravity, intensely pulling nearby objects, not at all pulling objects of medium distance, and weakly repelling objects that are very distant to it. Rather than orbit, its numerous moons simply congregate in an uneasy stasis about its neutral region.": "由于未知的原因，这颗在所有通讯线路上都发出高亢的嗡嗡声的行星，有一个扭曲的重力矢量，强烈地拉动附近的物体，完全不拉动中等距离的物体，而微弱地排斥与它非常遥远的物体。它的众多卫星不是在轨道上运行，而是简单地聚集在它的中性区域周围，处于不安的停滞状态。",
	"Made of etherstone, this planet's thousands of moons have perplexing characteristics. Depending on their rotations and velocities, two moons can collide, pass through one another, or even merge into a single larger moon. Because of this, the planet's orbit is a frenetic debris field of seemingly random collisions.": "这颗行星的数千颗卫星由醚石制成，具有令人困惑的特性。根据它们的旋转和速度，两颗卫星可以相互碰撞，相互穿过，甚至合并成一颗更大的卫星。正因为如此，这颗行星的轨道是一个狂热的碎片场，似乎是随机碰撞。",

	"Seemingly less a planet and more a tightly-compacted asteroid field, this planetoid consists of thousands of floating islands of rock, metal, and ice floating in layered orbits around a ball of solid iron. Perhaps the planetoid used to be solid, but encountered a catastrophe of epic proportions, shattering the planet and heavily magnetizing the core. It seems this magnetization, as well as the heavy iron content found in every bit of rock and ice in orbit within the planetoid, is what holds the disparate chunks of land in their orbit.": "这颗行星似乎不是一颗行星，而是一个紧缩的小行星场，它由数以千计的岩石、金属和冰的浮岛组成，以分层轨道漂浮在一个固体铁球的周围。也许这颗行星曾经是固体，但遇到了一场史诗般的灾难，粉碎了这颗行星并使核心严重磁化。似乎这种磁化，以及在行星轨道上的每一块岩石和冰中发现的重铁含量，是将这些不相干的陆地固定在其轨道上的原因。",

It seems to be constructed of some unbelievably dense exotic metal, buried under some miles of soil and rock. No force maintains an artificial gravity on the flat planetoid, so all of its water congregates in a spherical ocean, atop the gravitational center. On this small ocean, gravity would appear to behave normally, but venturing further out onto the coin would reveal that gravity always points to the center, making the flat surface feel like a slope that grows ever steeper as one nears the edge.": "几乎不用解释，这个行星（如果可以这么叫的话）的形状是一个巨大的圆形平面，就像一枚硬币在其轨道上不断翻转，先是露出一个面，然后是另一个面。它似乎是由某种难以置信的高密度外来金属构成的，被埋在几英里长的土壤和岩石之下。在这个平坦的行星上，没有任何力量维持人工重力，所以它所有的水都聚集在一个球形的海洋里，在引力中心的顶部。在这个小海洋上，重力似乎表现得很正常，但如果进一步向硬币上冒险，就会发现重力总是指向中心，使平坦的表面感觉像一个斜坡，随着人们接近边缘而变得越来越陡峭。",
	"All of the natural beasts on this planet are huge; they would be considered 'giant' or 'dire' beasts anywhere else in the 'verse.": "这个星球上所有的天然野兽都是巨大的；在'诗篇'的其他地方，它们会被认为是'巨人'或'可怕'的野兽。",
	"In contrast to being spherical (or even a vaguely globular shape), this planet has six faces, as a regular cube. Other than this bizarre construction, which relegates its north and south poles to the top and bottom faces of the cube, and bombards the other faces with intermittent but immense storms, this planet seems devoid of construction. How it maintains this shape is a mystery. The rest of its solar system, too, has perplexing geometries. It's nearest neighboring planet (whose orbit is closer to the parent star) is shaped as a tetrahedron, and its next nearest neighbor (further away from the star) is octahedral. The other two more distant planets have equally geometrical constructions. Most perplexing, the star itself (named Icosahedrax) has 20 sides, and radiates varying amounts of heat from its edges and its vertices. This star, too, seems more like a divine accident than a physical construction.": "与球形（甚至是一个模糊的球状）相反，这个星球有六个面，就像一个规则的立方体。除了这种奇怪的结构，将其南北两极归于立方体的顶部和底部，用间歇性但巨大的风暴轰击其他面，这个星球似乎没有任何结构。它如何保持这种形状是一个谜。它的太阳系的其他部分，也有令人困惑的几何形状。它最近的邻星（其轨道离母星更近）的形状是四面体，而它的下一个近邻（离母星更远）是八面体。另外两颗更远的行星也有同样的几何结构。最令人困惑的是，这颗恒星本身（被命名为二十面体）有20个面，并从其边缘和顶点辐射出不同数量的热量。这颗星，也似乎更像是一个神圣的意外，而不是一个物理结构。",
	"This planet is a single, colossal living creature—possibly the largest living thing in the 'verse. Its face, which takes up almost an entire hemisphere, is vaguely humanoid, with a pair of eyes the size of oceans and a gaping maw lined with jagged mountain ranges. What it eats and how it propels itself through space is a mystery. With powerful psionics, it might even be possible to communicate with the planet (thereby discovering that its motives are irredeemably evil), but doing so would no doubt enrage the planet, which despises all lesser lifeforms.": "这个星球是一个单一的、巨大的生物--可能是'诗篇'中最大的生物。它的脸，几乎占据了整个半球，隐约是人形，有一双海洋般大小的眼睛和一个有锯齿状山脉排列的大口。它吃什么，以及它如何在太空中推进自己，都是一个谜。如果有强大的幻术，甚至有可能与这个星球沟通（从而发现它的动机是不可救药的邪恶），但这样做无疑会激怒这个星球，它鄙视所有较小的生命体。",
	"This planet suffers from a mysterious temporal anomaly that randomly speeds up or slows down time on different parts of its surface. Two people separated by only a few miles could be the same age on one day, and ten years apart on the next. Communication across this world is routinely scrambled, as messages can arrive before they are even sent.": "这个星球上有一种神秘的时间异常现象，在其表面的不同地方随机地加快或减慢时间。两个相隔仅几英里的人在某一天可能是同龄人，而在下一天则相差十年。这个世界上的通信经常被扰乱，因为信息甚至在发送之前就已经到达。",
	"This planet is a luxury world, fabricated from scratch to have beautiful and diverse scenic vistas as far as the eye can see. It is climate-controlled to have year-round balmy weather and mild seasons. Even the wild food growing here is abundant and delicious. As perfect as it might seem, underneath the ground is a mechanical hellscape in charge of maintaining conditions on the surface. Those that live here are little more than a servant population, held under despotic rule and charged with maintenance on the 'Paradise Machine.'": "这个星球是一个豪华的世界，从头开始制造，拥有目之所及的美丽和多样化的风景。它的气候得到了控制，全年都有温和的天气和温和的季节。即使是生长在这里的野生食物也很丰富和美味。尽管看起来很完美，但在地面下是一个机械的地狱景象，负责维持地面上的条件。住在这里的人只不过是一个仆人，在专制统治下，负责维护 \"天堂机器\"。",
	"This planet is clearly artificial, for its entire surface is constructed of mile-wide hexagonal tiles. Each tile is raised to its own height and seems to consist of only one biome or terrain type. For example, the north pole of the planet is covered in similar-looking tundra tiles, but one coast abruptly gives way to mountain tiles and another forms a steep cliff where the sea meets the land.": "这个星球显然是人造的，因为它的整个表面是由一英里宽的六边形瓷砖构成的。每块瓷砖都被抬高到自己的高度，而且似乎只由一种生物群落或地形类型组成。例如，这个星球的北极被看起来相似的苔原瓷砖所覆盖，但一个海岸突然让位于山地瓷砖，另一个则在大海与陆地的交汇处形成了一个陡峭的悬崖。",
	"This small, gray world might appear to be a moon, but is actually a space station of incredible size, housing a weapon capable of razing entire worlds.": "这个灰色的小世界可能看起来是一个月球，但实际上是一个大小惊人的空间站，里面有一种能够夷平整个世界的武器。",
	"This planet appears to be a normal Tier 2 or Tier 3 world, with vibrant plant life, comfortable temperatures, and plentiful liquid oceans. Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that these oceans are not liquid water, but some other form of exotic fluid (liquid methane, blood, healing potion, mercury, tears, etc.)": "这个星球似乎是一个正常的2级或3级世界，有充满活力的植物生命，舒适的温度和丰富的液体海洋。仔细观察后发现，这些海洋不是液态水，而是其他形式的奇异液体（液态甲烷、血液、治疗药水、水银、眼泪等）。",
	"This planet is simultaneously two worlds: an idyllic Garden World by day, and a nightmarish hellscape by night. It is not simply that the land takes on a grim or beautiful aspect as its light changes; it seems that two planets literally occupy the same space here, alternating at dawn and dusk. Moreover, the two worlds are fully disparate, for where one might have a temple and a shaded forest, the other has a lake of lava and a craggy mountain. Only visitors to this world seem to notice the shift. Unattended objects, including those brought by visitors, and the planet's residents (monstrous and otherwise) simply vanish when the shift occurs, and reappear when their world returns.": "这个星球同时是两个世界：白天是田园风光的花园世界，晚上是噩梦般的地狱风景。这不仅仅是土地随着光线的变化而呈现出严峻或美丽的一面；似乎两个星球真的在这里占据了同一个空间，在黎明和黄昏交替出现。此外，这两个世界是完全不同的，因为一个世界可能有一座寺庙和一片阴凉的森林，另一个世界则有一个熔岩湖和一座峭壁山。只有这个世界的游客似乎才注意到这种转变。无人看管的物品，包括游客带来的物品，以及星球上的居民（畸形或其他）在转变发生时简单地消失，并在他们的世界恢复时重新出现。",
	"This majestic ringworld was clearly the creation of an extremely advanced race. At its center is a small artificial sun, which bathes the ring in everpresent sunshine, and powers its numerous hidden mechanisms.": "这个雄伟的环形世界显然是由一个极其先进的种族创造的。在它的中心是一个小型的人造太阳，它使环形世界沐浴在无时无刻的阳光下，并为其众多的隐藏机制提供动力。",
	"Sometimes, a planet doesn't need a grand design to make it stand out; just a few interesting traits will do. These quirks should help add some character to your planet, without otherwise requiring too much exposition.": "有时，一个星球不需要宏大的设计来使其脱颖而出；只要有一些有趣的特征就可以了。这些怪癖应该有助于为你的星球增加一些特征，而不需要过多的说明。",

	"Even brief exposure to hazardous radiation can kill, as evidenced by the bursts of radiant energy produced by blasters, but prolonged exposure can be just as deadly. A creature that spends one minute exposed to radiation must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour. While poisoned, the creature's hit point maximum is decreased by 5. Each subsequent failed saving throw against radiation while the creature is poisoned increases the duration the creature is poisoned by an additional hour and decreases its hit point maximum by an additional 5.

	"Long term consumption of Ocoulori Radavitis, also known as '{@item roach|darkmatter|roaches}', is addictive and dangerous. Roaches are sentient and psychic creatures, and their violent deaths gradually wear down the psyche of those who eat them. When a creature consumes a roach, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes addicted and gains one randomly-determined Indefinite Madness trait.

	"Whenever a ship loses its life support system while in the Black or someone decides to go on a spacewalk, they experience zero gravity. In zero gravity environments, creatures and objects hang in the air until they are moved. A creature in zero gravity can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. Its speed is otherwise reduced to zero. Once a creature or object is set into motion, it can't stop moving until it collides with an obstacle.

On a failure, it can't move at all on its turn.": "在高重力区域的每个生物，每移动一英尺必须花费两英尺的移动量，包括飞行、跳跃和攀爬移动。这可以和困难的地形结合起来，因此每移动一英尺要花费三英尺。如果一个俯卧的生物想要站起来，它必须成功地进行DC12力量检查。如果失败，它在它的回合中就不能移动。",
