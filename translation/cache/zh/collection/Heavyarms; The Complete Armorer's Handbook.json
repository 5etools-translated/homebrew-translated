Runestones, crafted from gemstones, can be affixed to runic equipment and act as a conduit for the powerful magics contained within, but channeling such magics requiresd attunement by the wielder.

	"Unfortunately the core rules don't offer any options for the scaling of items alongside the player character—and so that sword is inevitably discarded, cast away and forgotten.

Second, responsibility for equipment progression is yet another responsilibity on the shoulders of the Dungeon Master.": "不幸的是，核心规则没有提供任何与玩家角色一起缩放物品的选项，因此那把剑不可避免地被丢弃、抛弃和遗忘。这个问题是双重的。首先，它排除了将你的装备融入你的故事的可能性--要么是作为背景故事的一部分，要么是通过游戏使物品成为角色的组成部分（或者事实上，两者都是）。第二，装备发展的责任是地下城管理员的另一个责任。",

	"This appendix discusses the mathematical reasoning and other factors concerning the weapon upgrade system.": "本附录讨论了有关武器升级系统的数学推理和其他因素。",
	"The following table presents the average damage dealt per attack by a 5th level character (+4 ability modifier) for a weapon with each upgrade individually (no other upgrades) using on a Monte Carlo simulation of 50,000 rounds of attacks against a Normal Distribution of CR-appropriate enemies for that level (model assumes a mean AC of 15 with a 1.5 Standard Deviation.) For ease of comparison, a baseline (no upgrades) is presented following the same methodology:": "下表显示了一个5级的角色（+4能力修改器）对每个升级的武器（没有其他升级）的每次攻击的平均伤害，这是通过蒙特卡洛模拟，对该级别CR合适的敌人进行了50000次攻击（模型假设平均AC为15，标准偏差为1.5）。 为了便于比较，按照同样的方法显示了一个基线（没有升级）。",
	"In addition, the following table presents the average damage of a fully-upgraded weapon against a baseline +3 magic weapon for various categories of weapon grouped by die size and available upgrade mix at 15th level (+5 ability modifier, model assumes a mean AC of 18 with a 2.0 Standard Deviation) following the same methodology:": "此外，下表按照同样的方法介绍了各类武器按模子大小和15级时可用的升级组合（+5能力修改器，模型假设平均AC为18，标准偏差为2.0）对基线+3魔法武器的平均伤害。",
	"A fully-upgraded {@dice 2d6} weapon—the highest average damage—is equal to the baseline to within one decimal place, showing that the upgrade system doesn't exceed magical weapons at the top end. In addition, there is an increasing relative improvement for weapons with lower average damage, which helps to reward and incentivize their use.": "完全升级（%0%）的武器--最高的平均伤害--与基线相等，在小数点后一位之内，表明升级系统在最高端并没有超过魔法武器。此外，平均伤害较低的武器的相对改进也越来越大，这有助于奖励和激励其使用。",
	"A fully-upgraded {@dice 1d12} weapon possesses higher average damage than an equivalent {@dice 2d6} weapon due to stronger synergy with the {@b {@i brutal}} tag. This presents the player with an interesting choice: higher initial damage ({@dice 2d6}) versus higher average final damage ({@dice 1d12}). Furthermore, the 2d6 maul benefits the new siege property (if you are using the new weapon properties) and also has access to the {@b {@i flanged}} upgrade—offering an attractive option at an additional cost.": "一个完全升级的{@dice 1d12}武器拥有比同等的{@dice 2d6}武器更高的平均伤害，因为它与{@b {@i brutal}}标签的协同作用更强。这给玩家带来了一个有趣的选择：更高的初始伤害（（%3%））与更高的平均最终伤害（（%4%））。此外，2d6大锤得益于新的攻城属性（如果你使用新的武器属性），也可以获得{@b {@i flanged}}的升级--以额外的成本提供一个有吸引力的选择。",
	"These weapons can match a {@item greataxe|phb} for an additional cost of 4,000 gp. Functionally, this is 4,000 gp for the reach property at the finish line, which is fine.": "这些武器可以匹配一个{@item greataxe|phb}，额外费用为4,000GP。从功能上讲，这是在终点线上达到的属性的4,000GP，这很好。",
	"{@item Blowguns|phb} and {@item darts|phb} are significantly below the baseline, but gain exclusive access to powerful new types of special ammunition. Bows and crossbows are also below the baseline, and are likewise accounted for by the availability of special ammunition. In both cases, the lower total cost of upgrading is offset by the additional cost of ammunition.": "{@item Blowguns|phb}和{@item darts|phb}明显低于基线，但获得了强大的新类型特殊弹药的独家使用权。弓和弩也低于基线，同样是由特殊弹药的供应来说明。在这两种情况下，升级的总成本降低被弹药的额外成本所抵消。",
	"{@item Dagger|PHB|Daggers} benefit from an exceptional relative increase over the baseline thanks to exclusive access to the {@b {@i saw-toothed}} tag. This is personal taste, but its always bothered me that the iconic dagger is so mechanically suboptimal for a rogue. This closes the gap to the {@item rapier|phb} subsantially without the need for an errata of official material, and also provides the dagger with some unique flavor.": "{@item Dagger|PHB|Daggers}得益于对{@b {@i saw-toothed}}标签的独家使用，从相对于基线的特殊增加中获益。这是我的个人喜好，但我一直对标志性的匕首在机械上对流氓来说是次优的感到困扰。这在很大程度上缩小了与{@item rapier|phb}的差距，而不需要对官方材料进行勘误，并且还为匕首提供了一些独特的风味。",
	"The tables in this appendix are intended as convenient reference for players when determining available upgrades for each weapon type, the process for which is described in chapter 1.": "本附录中的表格旨在为玩家在确定每种武器类型的可用升级时提供方便的参考，其过程在第1章中描述。",

	"In short, because that's what money is for: a universal medium of exchange for goods and services. It's far more believable than alternative systems like exponential (and often unreasonable) time scaling or arbitrary level-locking. These alternatives are mechanically fine, but they feel very much like artificial restrictions (because they are).": "简而言之，因为这就是钱的作用：商品和服务的普遍交换媒介。这比其他系统，如指数（通常是不合理的）时间比例或任意的等级锁定，要可信得多。这些替代方案在机械上是好的，但它们感觉非常像人为的限制（因为它们是）。",
	"Furthermore, using money allows players to make universal value judgements. Could the fighter potentially upgrade their weapon at a faster-than-anticipated rate? Absolutely—if the group is willing to pay the opportunity cost (i.e. less gold for other things), which has a ripple effect far beyond the boundaries of this system. The more decisions you can hitch to money, the more valuable and interesting money becomes. As stated in the introduction, this is my first such supplement to be released on the Dungeon Masters Guild, but it won't be the last!": "此外，使用金钱可以让玩家做出普遍的价值判断。斗士有可能以比预期更快的速度升级他们的武器吗？当然可以--如果团队愿意支付机会成本（即减少用于其他事物的金币），这将产生远远超出这个系统界限的连锁反应。你能将更多的决定与金钱挂钩，金钱就变得更有价值和有趣。正如介绍中所说，这是我在地下城主协会上发布的第一个这样的补充资料，但它不会是最后一个!",
	"The best answer to this question is if the party has enough to afford some of the (level-appropriate) things they want but not everything then you're on the right track or thereabouts. This supplement is based on the relevant sections of the {@b {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}}, including the expected rate of accrual of wealth using the Treasure Hoard tables therein. This means that—used standalone—this supplement should put you on that right track. If, however, you incorporate additional money sinks (such as those in Strongholds & Followers) then consider increasing money-rewards accordingly, perhaps increasing the amount of coin awarded and decreasing magic item rewards by a commensurate amount (or allowing the group to sell any surplus magic items). Exercise your judgement based on the needs of your campaign.": "对这个问题的最佳答案是，如果当事人有足够的财力来购买他们想要的一些（与等级相适应的）东西，但不是所有的东西，那么你就在正确的轨道上，或者差不多了。这个补充是基于{@b {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}}的相关章节，包括使用其中的宝藏表的预期财富累积率。这意味着--单独使用--本补编应使你走上正确的轨道。然而，如果你加入了额外的金钱消耗（例如堡垒和追随者中的那些），那么就考虑相应地增加金钱奖励，也许增加奖励的硬币数量，并相应地减少魔法物品的奖励（或允许团体出售任何多余的魔法物品）。根据你的活动的需要进行判断。",
	"Yes! The system can easily accommodate this. First, you should attempt to \"recreate\" the weapon as closely as possible using a base weapon and any combination of upgrade tags in order to determine what tags it might already possesses. For example, to recreate the {@item dagger of venom|DMG} from the {@b {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}}:": "是的! 该系统可以很容易地适应这种情况。首先，你应该尝试使用基本武器和任何升级标签的组合，尽可能地 \"重新创建 \"武器，以确定它可能已经拥有的标签。例如，从{@b {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}}重新创建{@item dagger of venom|DMG}。",
	"Add the {@b {@i silvered}} and {@b {@i magical}} tags to overcome resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.": "添加{@b {@i silvered}}和{@b {@i magical}}标签以克服对非魔法攻击和伤害的抵抗和免疫。",
	"Add both the {@b {@i balanced}} and {@b {@i wounding—keen}} tags to gain a +1 bonus to attacks and damage made with this weapon.": "同时添加{@b {@i balanced}}和{@b {@i wounding—keen}}标签，以获得使用该武器的攻击和伤害的+1奖励。",
	"Add the {@b {@i runic}} tag and create an appropriate rune with the properties of the poisoning action described in the item text.": "添加{@b {@i runic}}标签并创建一个适当的符文，其属性为物品文本中描述的中毒行动。",
	"The above recreates the {@item dagger of venom|DMG} as if it were made following the rules in chapter 1. The dagger now requires attunement by the wielder (to gain the benefits of the affixed rune) but can now be upgraded!": "以上重现了{@item dagger of venom|DMG}，就好像它是按照第一章的规则制作的一样。匕首现在需要持剑者的调和（以获得所附符文的好处），但现在可以升级了",
	"The {@b {@i brutal}} tag {@u only} considers the weapon's damage dice, which means base weapon damage dice plus additional rolls of those dice from a critical hit. This doesn't include extra damage from other sources such as Divine Smite, Sneak Attack, the {@b {@i saw-toothed}} tag, and the {@optfeature tempest|TCAH} runestone.": "{@b {@i brutal}}标签{@u only}考虑了武器的伤害骰子，这意味着基本的武器伤害骰子加上来自关键打击的额外骰子卷。这不包括来自其他来源的额外伤害，如神击、偷袭、{@b {@i saw-toothed}}标签和{@optfeature tempest|TCAH}符石。",
	"Absolutely! For armor there is no issue because (armor proofing notwithstanding) available upgrades are independent of one another. For weapons, the cost-doubling nature of the system ensures that you can keep adding upgrades beyond what's presented while keeping any power creep cost-appropriate (i.e. exponential). For example, you could create a new 1st tier focus tag that enables a weapon to be used as a spellcasting focus for your spells.": "当然！对于装甲来说，没有任何问题，因为（尽管有装甲防护）可用的升级是相互独立的。对于盔甲来说，没有任何问题，因为（尽管有盔甲防卫）可用的升级是相互独立的。对于武器来说，系统的成本翻倍性质确保了你可以不断地增加升级，同时保持任何力量的攀升都是成本适当的（即指数式的）。例如，你可以创建一个新的第一层焦点标签，使武器能够被用作你的法术的焦点。",
	"Furthermore, you can scale the weapon upgrade system into epic levels by creating a new 4th tier with a base cost of 100,000 gp, and even a 5th tier with a base cost of 1,000,000 gp—though presumably these tiers are beyond the skillset of even a master artisan, and the group will need to entreat a higher power for assistance!": "此外，你可以通过创建一个基础成本为100,000金币的新的第四层，甚至是基础成本为1,000,000金币的第五层，将武器升级系统扩展到史诗级别--尽管这些层级可能超出了甚至是工匠大师的技能范围，并且该小组将需要向更高的力量寻求帮助",
	"A tangential benefit of the armor upgrade system is giving heavier armors a bit more \"oomph\" than under the default rules, where Dexterity and light armor are typically regarded as king. If you don't like it, the power is yours.": "盔甲升级系统的一个切身好处是给较重的盔甲以更多的 \"动力\"，而在默认规则下，灵巧和轻型盔甲通常被视为国王。如果你不喜欢它，权力就是你的。",
	"You have a keen eye, Watson! Indeed, while I usually loathe to befoul official material in this way (overlapping or redundant features and such), after much consideration the muffled tag remains to my eye the more natural means of obtaining this particular benefit. As such, in games that use feats consider replacing the first bullet of the {@feat Medium Armor Master|PHB} feat with the following:": "你有一双敏锐的眼睛，华生! 的确，虽然我通常不愿意以这种方式来玷污官方材料（重叠或多余的特征等），但在我看来，经过深思熟虑后，消音标签仍然是获得这种特殊好处的更自然的方法。因此，在使用特技的游戏中，可以考虑将{@feat Medium Armor Master|PHB}特技的第一项内容替换为以下内容。",
	"Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.": "使你的灵巧得分增加1，最高为20。",
	"During the creation of this ruleset we tried a variety of mechanics to \"track\" equipment degredation, and ultimately found none worth the time and effort of doing so. Instead, a simple \"milestone\" approach (whereby the DM reminds players when their gear might starting to show signs of wear) seems to be the best approach.": "在创建这套规则的过程中，我们尝试了各种机制来 \"追踪 \"装备的退化，但最终发现没有一个值得花时间和精力去做。相反，一个简单的 \"里程碑 \"方法（DM提醒玩家他们的装备何时开始出现磨损迹象）似乎是最好的方法。",
	"New runestones are always being created or discovered by members of the Runesmith's Guild! Magic items are a popular field of study, meaning an easy way to create your own runestones is to use the properties of your favorite magic items. Who knows, maybe a bounty is offered by the guild for magic items with undiscovered properties or will accept donations of such items for study—offering the donor a runestone imbued with its magical properties once they have been decoded.": "新的符文石总是被符文师协会的成员们创造或发现的! 魔法物品是一个很受欢迎的研究领域，这意味着创造自己的符文石的一个简单方法是使用你最喜欢的魔法物品的属性。谁知道呢，也许公会会对具有未被发现的属性的魔法物品进行悬赏，或者接受捐赠的此类物品进行研究--一旦这些物品被解码，就会向捐赠者提供被赋予魔法属性的符文石。",
	"Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver ammunition, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their ammunition in silver. You can silver ten pieces of ammunition for 25 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the ammunition without making it less effective.": "一些对非魔法武器有免疫力或抵抗力的怪物容易受到银色弹药的影响，因此谨慎的冒险者会投入额外的硬币，将弹药镀成银色。你可以用25金币给10件弹药镀银。这笔费用不仅代表了银的价格，还代表了在弹药上添加银而不降低其效果所需的时间和专业知识。",
	"This is a type of body armor made from small rectangular plates (scales or lamellae) of iron, leather, or bronze laced into horizontal rows.": "这是一种由铁、皮革或青铜制成的矩形小板（鳞片或薄片）系成横排的护身甲。",
