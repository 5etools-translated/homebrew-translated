	"An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.": "天使杀戮邪恶的生物而无怨无悔。作为法律和善的化身，天使的判断几乎从不出错。这种品质会在天使身上产生一种优越感，当天使的任务与其他生物的目标发生冲突时，这种感觉就会凸显出来。天使从不默许或让步。当一个天使被派来帮助凡人时，它不是被派来服务，而是被派来指挥。因此，善神只在最可怕的情况下才派他们的天使到凡人中间。",
	"An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.": "天使的道德指南针赋予它一种无懈可击的感觉，而这种感觉有时会使它走向灭亡。天使通常很聪明，不会被简单的欺骗所迷惑，但有时骄傲会使人做出邪恶的行为。无论有意还是无意，这样的行为都是一个永久的污点，标志着天使是一个被抛弃的人。堕落的天使保留了他们的力量，但失去了与他们被制造出来的神祗的联系。大多数堕落的天使对他们的放逐耿耿于怀，通过寻求对深渊某部分的统治权或在九层地狱的其他堕落者中占有一席之地来反抗他们所服务的权力。九层地狱第一层的统治者扎里尔就是这样一个生物。一些堕落的天使并没有反叛，而是在物质世界中甘愿过着与世隔绝的生活，伪装成简单的隐士生活。如果他们被救赎，他们可以成为强大的盟友，致力于正义和慈悲的服务。",
	"An angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "天使不需要吃、喝、睡。",

This is often to the chagrin of the more straightforward other head who merely wishes to return to a simple life of squashing smaller folk and stealing sheep.
