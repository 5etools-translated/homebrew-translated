You can use your action to take total control of one of the targets. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you decide and does nothing you don't allow it to. You can also have the creatures use a reaction, but this takes your reaction as well. Any action you force a creature to do that requires a roll is at disadvantage.": "从当前命中率最低的生物开始，每个受此能力影响的生物都受你控制。从总数中减去每个生物的命中率，然后再转向命中率次低的生物。一个生物的命中率必须等于或小于剩余的总数，该生物才会受到影响。所有受影响的生物都会被克制。你可以使用你的行动来完全控制其中一个目标。直到你的下一回合结束，该生物只采取你决定的行动，不做你不允许它做的事。你也可以让生物使用反应，但这也需要你的反应。你强迫生物做的任何需要掷骰子的动作都是不利的。",
	"At the start of a creature's turn, it can make a Wisdom saving throw, on a success the ability ends. On a failure, they are still affected by Blood Puppetry. If the target takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the ability ends for that creature.": "在一个生物的回合开始时，它可以做一个智慧救赎，如果成功，能力就会结束。如果失败，它们仍会受到血偶术的影响。如果目标受到伤害，它可以再次进行智慧救赎。如果成功，该生物的能力就会结束。",
	"Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this ability.": "亡灵和对被魅惑免疫的生物不受此能力影响。",
	"At 10th level, you can spend Blood Points to reduce incoming damage. If you would normally take damage, you can use your reaction and spend any number of Blood Points to reduce the damage taken by {@damage 1d10} per Blood Point spent in this manner. Additionally, you deal necrotic damage equal to half your wizard level rounded down to the attacking creature.": "在10级的时候，你可以花费血点来减少传入的伤害。如果你通常会受到伤害，你可以使用你的反应并花费任意数量的血量来减少所受的伤害，每花费一个血量就减少百分之零点。此外，你对攻击的生物造成的坏死伤害等于你的巫师等级的一半，向下取整。",
	"At 14th level, your Blood Puppetry improves to {@damage 1d12} per Blood Point spent and a controlled creature no longer has disadvantage on the roll to perform forced actions.": "14级时，你的血傀儡术提高到（%0%），每消耗一个血点，被控制的生物在进行强制行动时不再有劣势。"
