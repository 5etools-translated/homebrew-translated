	"This work is a combination of several dragon themed homebrew that I have created over the years, as well as a few collaborations. It also features art that I have commissioned from several artists, as mentioned in the Credit chapter.": "这部作品是我多年来创作的几部以龙为主题的自制作品的组合，以及一些合作作品。它还包括我委托几位艺术家创作的艺术作品，这一点在 \"信用 \"一章中已经提到。",
	"Dragons have always been a centerpiece for Dungeons & Dragons, and I felt that the transition of 3.5 Edition to 5th Edition left several great dragon themed works behind. As such I created this homebrew for those that want to have more dragon related content in their campaigns. It also includes several revisions of existing races and subclasses, due to how unthematic or underwhelming they have felt to many players, including myself. Particularly, the Dragonborn have felt rather underwhelming and are widely accepted to be underpowered compared to the other race options. This homebrew is meant to make them more on equal footing with the other races by giving them subraces of their own.": "龙一直是《龙与地下城》的核心，我觉得从3.5版过渡到5版时，留下了一些以龙为主题的伟大作品。因此，我为那些想在他们的战役中拥有更多与龙有关的内容的人创造了这个自制作品。它还包括对现有种族和子类的一些修订，因为这些种族和子类对许多玩家来说是不伦不类的，包括我自己。特别是，龙族给人的感觉是相当的无力，与其他种族的选择相比，他们被普遍认为是力量不足的。这个自制版本旨在通过赋予他们自己的子种族，使他们与其他种族更平等地站在一起。",
	"I have also created a half dragon player race, who are less bestial than the Monster Manual version, because I based them on their more human appearance in the 2006 book Races of the Dragon, which just made more sense to me.": "我还创造了一个半龙人的玩家种族，他们没有《怪物手册》版本那么兽性，因为我根据2006年《龙的种族》一书中他们更像人类的外表，这对我来说就是更有意义。",
	"Additionally, I've added a revised Draconic Bloodline for the sorcerer class. It is largely the same as the original, but allows for more playstyle options. This version grants additional benefits when you're within melee range of your enemies, which is traditionally dangerous for a sorcerer, and allows melee sorcerers to become more viable.": "此外，我还为巫师类添加了修订后的《德拉贡血统》。它与原版基本相同，但允许更多的玩法选择。这个版本在你处于敌人的近战范围内时给予额外的好处，这对巫师来说是传统的危险，并允许近战巫师变得更加可行。",
	"I have given some subclasses mechanics that let you gain different benefits if you already have resistance, so that half dragons and dragonborn can choose thematic dragon types without being punished for having the same resistance.": "我给了一些子类的机制，让你在已经拥有抗性的情况下获得不同的好处，这样半龙和龙裔就可以选择主题龙类型，而不会因为拥有相同的抗性而受到惩罚。",
	"This work contains several subclasses, including a revised Purple Dragon Knight subclass for the fighter class, also known as the Banneret subclass. It also contains a dragon themed spell list, items, and unique items that can be gifted by dragons themselves to players. The Religion section covers draconic lore that is less known, seeing as many books already refer Tiamat and Bahamut. Which is why the kobold god Kurtulmak has the biggest section, as outside the 2006 book Races of the Dragon, little of his other side is mentioned. I have added additional dinosaurs for the Circle of Savagery (or as foes), and although the dilophosaurus and spinosaurus aren't truly accurate I felt it would be fine for a fantasy setting.": "本作包含了几个子类，包括修订后的战士类的紫龙骑士子类，也被称为班纳特子类。它还包含了以龙为主题的法术列表、物品，以及可以由龙自己赠予玩家的独特物品。宗教部分涵盖了鲜为人知的龙族传说，因为许多书已经提到了提亚马特和巴哈姆特。这就是为什么哥布林神Kurtulmak拥有最大的部分，因为在2006年的《龙的种族》一书之外，很少提到他的其他方面。我为 \"野蛮圈 \"增加了额外的恐龙（或作为敌人），虽然地龙和刺龙并不真正准确，但我觉得对于一个奇幻设定来说，这是很好的。",
	"The Dragon Student is a bit unusual, due to their pact choice restriction; but I wanted to shift their customization options to the dragon types to make it more interesting, and also to balance the subclass out while keeping them thematic. It is similar to the Battle Smith, yet also quite different, and so far the playtests have been promising.": "龙族学生有点不寻常，因为他们的契约选择受到限制；但我想把他们的自定义选项转移到龙族类型上，以使其更有趣，同时也是为了在保持主题的同时平衡子类。它与战斗史密斯相似，但也有很大的不同，到目前为止，游戏测试结果令人满意。",
	"The content in this work has been playtested, and based on all the feedback I believe it should be fairly balanced in practice. Of course, whether you can use the content in this work is still up to the DM's discretion. I hope that you will enjoy this finalized work, as well as the artworks that I have commissioned for it, and that you may have many fun and interesting adventures with it.": "本作品中的内容已经过游戏测试，根据所有的反馈，我相信它在实践中应该是相当平衡的。当然，你是否能使用本作品中的内容，仍由管理员决定。我希望你会喜欢这部定稿的作品，以及我为它委托的艺术作品，并希望你可以用它进行许多有趣的冒险。",
	"{@b NOTE:} The spells that are cast through racial traits in this work do not require any material components. This includes player race traits, and the spells that the Dragon Student gains through their unique trait, including rituals.": "{@b NOTE:} 本作中通过种族特质施展的法术不需要任何物质成分。这包括玩家的种族特质，以及龙族学生通过其独特特质获得的法术，包括仪式。",
	"The four races presented in this work—{@race Dragonborn|CotDDPRaS|Dragonborn (Revised)}, {@race Half Dragon|CotDDPRaS}, {@race Kobold|CotDDPRaS|Kobold (Revised)} and {@race Lizardfolk|CotDDPRaS|Lizardfolk (Revised)} can be found, along with their subraces and variant options, in the {@filter Races|races|source=CotDDPRaS} page.": "本作品中介绍的四个种族--{@race Dragonborn|CotDDPRaS|Dragonborn (Revised)}、{@race Half Dragon|CotDDPRaS}、{@race Kobold|CotDDPRaS|Kobold (Revised)}和{@race Lizardfolk|CotDDPRaS|Lizardfolk (Revised)}，以及它们的子种族和变体选项，都可以在{@filter Races|races|source=CotDDPRaS}页中找到。",

	"Half dragons, dragonborn, and kobolds are often collectively referred to as the draconic races. The one thing that all draconic races have in common is that the blood of dragons flows through their veins. Because of this, or in some cases despite this, they are naturally drawn to each other.": "半龙人、龙裔和哥布林通常被统称为龙人种族。所有龙人种族都有一个共同点，那就是他们的血管里流淌着龙的血液。正因为如此，或者在某些情况下，尽管如此，他们还是会自然地相互吸引。",
	"Dragonborn, as their name indicates, are born from dragons. They were created with the essence of dragons and look the most draconic out of all the humanoid draconic races. Like half dragons, the blood of a particular type of dragon runs strong through each dragonborn, granting additional traits.": "龙裔，正如他们的名字所示，是由龙诞生的。他们是用龙的精髓创造出来的，在所有的人形龙族中看起来最像龙族。就像半龙人一样，龙族中流淌着一种特殊类型的龙的血液，赋予了他们额外的特征。",
	"Despite this, most don't have a tail like the half dragons have, and those that do are often shunned due to it being considered a bad omen for dragonborn to have a tail. They are divided into subgroups based on the draconic fragments that they possess. Most are blessed with a powerful soul piercing roar, while others have developing wings. Regardless of their gifts, they have a reputation for being reliable and honorable.": "尽管如此，大多数人都没有像半龙那样的尾巴，而那些有尾巴的人往往会被避开，因为有尾巴被认为是龙裔的一个坏兆头。他们根据所拥有的龙族碎片被划分为不同的亚群。大多数人被赋予了强大的穿透灵魂的吼声，而其他人则拥有发育中的翅膀。无论他们的天赋如何，他们都以可靠和可敬著称。",
	"Their origins vary, but often they were created by dragons as shock troops and servants. Because of this dragonborn have mixed feelings towards dragons in general. A few take pride in their origin, but most hold a grudge against dragons as they were little more than slaves. Regardless of their stance on this, dragonborn pride themselves on their own skill and ability to take care of themselves, showing their worth through their own actions. As such, a continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the dragonborn race. They value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. And they make mastery of a particular skill their lifetime goal. Those half dragons that are raised by dragonborn communities usually have a similar mindset and will often strive even harder to prove their worth. To most dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position. Unlike half dragons, dragonborn live relative short lives, only around 80 years, but no less fulfilling ones.": "他们的起源各不相同，但通常他们是由龙创造的，作为冲击部队和仆人。正因为如此，龙族对一般的龙有着复杂的感情。少数人对自己的出身感到自豪，但大多数人对龙抱有怨恨，因为他们只不过是奴隶而已。无论他们对此的立场如何，龙族都以自己的技能和照顾自己的能力为荣，通过自己的行动显示自己的价值。因此，对自我完善的持续推动反映了龙裔种族的自给自足。他们重视所有努力中的技能和卓越。他们讨厌失败，在放弃某件事情之前，他们会把自己逼到极致努力。而且他们把掌握某项技能作为自己的终身目标。那些被龙裔社区抚养长大的半龙人通常也有类似的心态，并且往往会更加努力地证明自己的价值。对大多数龙裔来说，氏族比生命本身更重要。每个龙裔的行为都反映了他或她的氏族的荣誉，给氏族带来的不光彩会导致被驱逐和流放。每个龙族都知道他或她在族中的地位和职责，而荣誉要求保持这种地位的界限。与半龙不同，龙族的寿命相对较短，只有80年左右，但也不失为一个充实的生命。",
	"Dragonborn as a whole share a strong bond with half dragons, despite the origins of the latter. Even those dragonborn that hold the greatest grudge against dragons will often not extend this grudge to half dragons. This is likely due to the similarities that both races share, most of all how they similarly have draconic blood, and don't feel that this defines them similar to how it does not define themselves.": "龙族作为一个整体，与半龙有着紧密的联系，尽管后者的起源是如此。即使是那些对龙族抱有最大怨恨的龙族，也往往不会将这种怨恨延伸到半龙身上。这可能是由于两个种族都有相似之处，最重要的是他们都有类似的龙族血统，并且不觉得这定义了他们，就像它没有定义自己一样。",
	"They also tolerate the presence of kobolds, and even come to their defense when they are in trouble. Unless they deserve it, which is usually the case. Nonetheless, they respect the race it's devotion to their families and the group as a whole, and have grown to appreciate their skill at sewage management.": "他们也容忍哥布林的存在，甚至在哥布林遇到麻烦时还会为他们辩护。除非他们罪有应得，通常是这样的。尽管如此，他们尊重这个种族它对家庭和整个团体的奉献，并逐渐欣赏他们在污水管理方面的技能。",
	"They often get annoyed at the borderline worship that kobolds have for them, but generally tolerate it while simultaneously relying heavily upon their unorthodox skills and high numbers.": "他们经常对哥布林对他们的边缘崇拜感到恼火，但一般都能容忍，同时又非常依赖他们非正统的技能和高数量。",
	"Their opinion on the other races varies, as they tend to value people's skill and merit the most. Usually, they tend to get along with dwarves due to their strong senses of honor and duty. Humans are seen as both fascinating as well as dangerous, but overall they have a friendly relationship. They respect the skill of the Elves and the strong sense towards communities that halflings have. Gnomes are seen with a slightly less positive view due to their rivalry with the kobolds, to whom they have grown somewhat attached. But if a gnome proves its merit, it will often find a devoted ally and friend.": "他们对其他种族的看法各不相同，因为他们倾向于最重视人们的技能和功绩。通常情况下，他们倾向于与矮人相处，因为他们有强烈的荣誉感和责任感。人类被视为既迷人又危险，但总的来说，他们有一种友好的关系。他们尊重精灵的技能和半身人对社区的强烈意识。由于地精与哥布林的竞争，他们对哥布林有些依恋，因此地精的看法略显不积极。但如果一个地精证明了自己的优点，它往往会找到一个忠实的盟友和朋友。",
	"The dragonborn are the most organized of all the draconic races. This is because they were originally created as foot soldiers for true dragons, to fight in their many wars. Eventually many broke free, but they kept their military ways. Although dragonborn are divided within clans, all clans come together and form legions together, working under a council that was elected by the numerous clans. These are named the Ironscale Legions, and are a force to be reckoned with.": "龙族是所有龙族中最有组织的种族。这是因为他们最初是作为真龙的步兵，在他们的许多战争中作战。最终，许多人挣脱了束缚，但他们保留了自己的军事方式。虽然龙族在部族内有分歧，但所有部族都聚集在一起，共同组成军团，在由众多部族选出的理事会领导下工作。这些军团被命名为铁鳞军团，是一支不可忽视的力量。",
	"These legions comprise mostly out of dragonborn, but also contain a large number of kobolds, who function as scouts and support, as well as half dragons who fill more specialized roles. True dragons however, due to the stigma that the dragonborn have against them, are generally not accepted within the ranks of a legion. Other humanoid races who are part of draconic communities, provided they prove their worth, may also become part of an Ironscale Legion. Usually these are mortal partners of half dragons, or simply races that have been absorbed within the draconic nation.": "这些军团主要由龙裔组成，但也包含大量的哥布林，他们充当侦察员和支援者，以及担任更多特殊角色的半龙。然而，由于龙族对他们的鄙视，真龙一般不被军团接受。其他属于龙人社区的类人种族，只要他们证明自己的价值，也可以成为铁鳞军团的一员。通常这些人是半龙的凡人伙伴，或者仅仅是被龙人国家吸收的种族。",
	"Divine spellcasters are a touchy subject, because they believe that the gods created them to be slaves of the dragons. Because of this many dragonborn consider it taboo for dragonborn to worship the gods. Especially since they feel that one must prove themselves through their own skill and show their worth instead of worshiping gods. Nonetheless, within the Ironscale Legion the results are ultimately what matters.": "神圣的施法者是一个敏感的话题，因为他们相信诸神创造他们是为了成为龙的奴隶。正因为如此，许多龙裔认为龙裔崇拜神灵是一种禁忌。尤其是他们觉得一个人必须通过自己的技能来证明自己，显示自己的价值，而不是去崇拜神灵。尽管如此，在铁鳞军团内部，结果才是最终的关键。",
	"The Legion understands the use of healing and supportive magic, and as such dragonborn clerics are tolerated and even appreciated if they prove their worth. Though most divine spellcasters tend to be half dragons. Bards on the other hand are greatly appreciated within the ranks, both for their skill at healing as well as boosting the morale of the troops. Wizards and Sorcerers are also a fundamental part of a legion, as they suffer no taboo for their magic. After all, they learned how to wield magic themselves after either hard work, or because they were naturally talented, which are both traits that the dragonborn value.": "军团了解治疗和支持性魔法的使用，因此龙裔牧师被容忍，如果他们证明自己的价值，甚至会受到赞赏。尽管大多数神圣的施法者往往是半龙人。另一方面，吟游诗人在队伍中受到极大的赞赏，因为他们在治疗方面的技能以及提高部队的士气。巫师和女巫也是军团的基本组成部分，因为他们的魔法不受禁忌。毕竟，他们是在努力工作之后才学会如何挥舞魔法的，或者是因为他们天生就有天赋，这都是龙裔重视的特征。",
	"The relationship that dragonborn have with the gods is a complicated one. Depending on your setting, this may also vary. In the forgotten realms setting, the dragonborn originate from Abeir, where they were servants and slaves of the dragons. Religion never took place on Abeir because the gods only existed on Toril, which is the main setting of the forgotten realms. Abeir was the planet of the primordials, where they ruled instead. On Abeir, no god would answer your prayers, so divine magic was largely useless there. The dragons eventually rose up against their former primordial masters, and eventually conquered most of the planet.": "龙族与诸神的关系是一种复杂的关系。根据你的设定，这也可能有所不同。在被遗忘的国度的设定中，龙裔起源于亚伯尔，他们是龙的仆人和奴隶。宗教从未在Abeir发生过，因为诸神只存在于Toril，这是被遗忘的领域的主要设定。Abeir是原始人的星球，他们在那里进行统治。在Abeir，没有神会回应你的祈祷，所以神圣的魔法在那里基本没有用。龙族最终奋起反抗他们以前的原始人主人，并最终征服了这个星球的大部分地区。",
	"Through this war they artificially created the dragonborn, as the perfect soldiers. They lived short lives compared to dragons, but they reproduced a lot faster, and were created in mass numbers. Some tried to fight off the tyranny of dragons, but most failed. During the spell plague, a large city of dragonborn was transported to Toril, and from here dragonborn were able to walk among humans and the many other races. This could be different for your setting, but they are generally former slaves of the dragons, and believe that the gods abandoned them to dragon kind. Nevertheless, they respect talented clerics for their support magic, and once they have proven their worth will generally always accept them. Among the newly accepted gods, Bahamut the platinum dragon has become the most popular.": "通过这场战争，他们人为地创造了龙裔，作为完美的士兵。与龙相比，他们的寿命很短，但他们的繁殖速度快得多，而且被大量创造。一些人试图反抗龙的暴政，但大多数人都失败了。在法术瘟疫期间，一个大型的龙族城市被运送到了托里尔，从这里龙族能够在人类和许多其他种族中行走。这对你的设定来说可能有所不同，但他们一般都是龙族的前奴隶，并相信诸神将他们抛弃给了龙族。尽管如此，他们尊重有天赋的神职人员的支持性魔法，一旦他们证明了自己的价值，一般总是会接受他们。在新接受的神灵中，铂金龙巴哈姆特已经成为最受欢迎的神灵。",
	"Dragonforged are modified warforged, and considered the pinacle of dragonborn crafting. The creation of these dragonforged was commissioned by several legions, who sought to create loyal and stalwart sentries against enemies that relied heavily on ambush tactics and assassinations. These modifications include darkvision, a \"breath weapon\" which launches several metal shards, and a restoration system that allows them to be more easily revived after battle. However, this came at the cost of their specialized design, and their new restoration system had a significant flaw; it conflicted with their integrated protection, and limited restoration magic from sources other than itself, as the system saw those as an outside threat while the dragonforged was in combat. Nevertheless, this flaw was accepted as many saw it at as a way of self reliance, which is considered a great virtue among dragonborn. The legions considered the project a great success, as they became known as efficient sentries, guards, and vanguard. Once they gained sentience, the dragonborn openly welcomed them in their societies, due to the merit they had shown in their shared battles. Now these dragonforged must find their own place in this world, or they can remain in the service of their creators, which many do.": "龙锻人是经过改良的战锻人，被认为是龙族工艺的巅峰之作。这些龙人的创造是由几个军团委托的，他们试图创造出忠诚和坚韧的哨兵来对付那些严重依赖伏击战术和暗杀的敌人。这些改造包括黑暗视觉，发射数个金属碎片的 \"呼吸武器\"，以及允许他们在战斗后更容易复活的修复系统。然而，这是以他们的专门设计为代价的，他们的新修复系统有一个显著的缺陷；它与他们的综合保护相冲突，并限制来自自身以外的修复魔法，因为系统将那些视为外部威胁，而龙锻人正在战斗中。尽管如此，这个缺陷还是被接受了，因为许多人认为这是一种自力更生的方式，这在龙族中被认为是一种伟大的美德。军团认为这个项目非常成功，因为他们被称为高效的哨兵、卫兵和先锋队。一旦他们获得了知觉，龙族就公开欢迎他们加入他们的社会，因为他们在共同的战斗中表现出的功绩。现在，这些龙人必须在这个世界上找到自己的位置，或者他们可以继续为他们的创造者服务，很多人都这么做了。",
	"When playing a warforged, you can choose to play the dragonforged variant, provided you have your DM's permission. If you do, then you lose your Specialized Design trait, and you must choose Draconic as your other language. In exchange you gain the following racial traits:": "当你扮演一个战神时，你可以选择扮演龙神的变体，只要你有你的DM的许可。如果你这样做了，那么你就失去了你的专业设计特性，并且你必须选择龙语作为你的其他语言。作为交换，你将获得以下的种族特性。",
	"You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can only discern shades of gray in darkness.": "你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线下看东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中就像昏暗光线一样。你在黑暗中只能分辨出灰色的深浅。",
	"You go through a process every time you rest in which you shed metal on the inside and it is collected inside your \"stomach\". You can use your bonus action to exhale these shards of metal in a 15- foot cone. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes {@dice 2d6} piercing damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases by an additional {@dice 1d6} at 5th level, 8th level, 11th level, and 17th level. You regain the use of your breath weapon after finishing a short or long rest.": "你每次休息时都会经历一个过程，你会在内部脱落金属，并将其收集到你的 \"胃 \"中。你可以使用你的额外行动将这些金属碎片呼出，范围为15英尺。当你使用你的呼吸武器时，呼气区域内的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。这个蓄力动作的DC等于8+你的宪法修改器+你的熟练度奖励。蓄力失败时，生物会受到{@dice 2d6}的穿刺伤害，蓄力成功时则受到一半的伤害。在5级、8级、11级和17级，伤害会额外增加1%。在完成短期或长期休息后，你可以重新使用你的呼吸武器。",
	"While wearing magical armor, these shards count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you add double the armor's magic AC bonus (if any) as additional damage to this breath weapon.": "在穿戴魔法盔甲时，这些碎片算作魔法，以克服对非魔法攻击和伤害的抵抗力和免疫力，并且你将盔甲的双倍魔法交流奖励（如果有的话）作为该呼吸武器的额外伤害。",
	"While you are in combat, any healing you receive from other creatures is halved.": "当你处于战斗状态时，你从其他生物获得的任何治疗都会减半。",
	"If a spell, such as {@spell raise dead}, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), then the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you. In addition, these spells can be used to resurrect you within 1 day if the original time limit was shorter (such as the {@spell revivify} spell). While {@condition unconscious}, when you become stable you regain 1 hit point after 1 minute.": "如果一个法术，例如{@spell raise dead}，唯一的效果是让你恢复生命（但不是不死），那么施法者不需要物质成分来对你施法。此外，如果原来的时限更短，这些法术可以在1天内使你复活（比如{@spell revivify}的法术）。当{@condition unconscious}时，当你变得稳定时，你会在1分钟后恢复1点命中。",
	"You can attune to magic items that require attunement by a dragonborn.": "你可以调整需要龙裔调和的魔法物品。",
	"Half dragons are the most \"human\" among the draconic races. They appear like humans, with scales and hair colors that match their most dominant draconic ancestor. They have a long scaly tail, scaled legs, and a few scales on their torso, arms, and face.": "半龙是龙族中最 \"人性化 \"的种族。他们看起来像人类，拥有与他们最主要的龙人祖先相匹配的鳞片和头发颜色。他们有一条长长的有鳞的尾巴，有鳞的腿，以及躯干、手臂和脸上的一些鳞片。",
	"In addition they have draconic horns sprouting from their heads, as well as draconic looking eyes. Half dragons are divided in subraces based on which draconic ancestor is the most dominant for them. Based on their ancestry, they are blessed with various benefits. But a powerful breath weapon is what they all have in common, even compared to that of the dragonborn.": "此外，他们的头上还长有龙人的角，以及龙人的眼睛。半龙根据哪个龙族祖先对他们来说是最主要的，而被划分为子种族。根据他们的祖先，他们被赋予了各种好处。但强大的呼吸武器是他们的共同点，即使与龙裔相比也是如此。",
	"Half dragons are different from dragonborn in that they were not artificially created, but instead are born or are descended from unions between dragons and mortal partners. Metallic dragons are known for their ability to take on humanoid forms, especially silver dragons, whose love for humanity has caused them to create an entire human subrace; the silverbrow humans. However, dragons are magical creatures, and many are able to wield powerful magic (see the Dragons as Innate Spellcasters variant rule in the Monster Manual on page 86). As such many chromatic dragons have been able to create half dragon bloodlines of their own. Blue dragon particularly are known for creating many half dragon offspring, as a way of creating weaker soldiers that will be less likely to betray them. Interesting enough, despite being chromatic dragons, blue dragons are known for being loving parents to any of their children, dragon or half dragon. Half dragons possess less bestial traits than dragonborn, but possess undeniable potential and the possibility to \"ascend to dragonhood\". This grants the half dragon the ability to assume their true dragon form, and become a full-fledged dragon.": "半龙与龙裔不同，他们不是人工创造的，而是龙与凡人伙伴结合后的产物或后代。金属龙以其具有人形的能力而闻名，尤其是银龙，他们对人类的爱使他们创造了一个完整的人类亚种：银眉人。然而，龙是一种神奇的生物，许多龙能够挥舞强大的魔法（参见《怪物手册》第86页的龙是天生的施法者变异规则）。因此，许多色龙已经能够创造出属于自己的半龙血统。尤其是蓝龙，他们以创造许多半龙血统的后代而闻名，以此来创造较弱的士兵，使他们不太可能背叛自己。有趣的是，尽管是色龙，但蓝龙却以对其任何孩子，无论是龙还是半龙，都是慈爱的父母而闻名。半龙拥有比龙裔更少的兽性特征，但拥有不可否认的潜力和 \"升为龙族 \"的可能性。这使半龙有能力拥有他们真正的龙形，并成为一个成熟的龙。",
	"In addition, half dragons live a lot longer than dragonborn, being able to live almost a millennium, and surpassing the age of elves. Despite this, they often have more children than elves do, and as such are a fast expending race, almost as fast as dragonborn. The only thing keeping this race in check from overwhelming areas are the many conflicts they tend to have. Not because they are necessarily violent (though in the case of some half dragon subraces this is indeed the case), but because they are a prideful race that doesn't shy away from a challenge and often meets it head on. Combined with the half dragon race its desire to become stronger and seek out challenges, they tend to live dangerous lives. In order to expand and increase their survival changes, half dragons usually spend the early parts of their long lives rearing and raising children, and will only adventure once they feel they have experienced this kind of life long enough, potentially leaving their current children into the care of their spouse or families. Their long lives allow them to experience both lifestyles, and it isn't uncommon for a half dragon adventurer to have children waiting at home, or to return to a life of family once their adventuring lives are behind them. However, despite their claims, their adventuring lives are never truly left behind, as their racial drive to become stronger often pushes them back into it once more. Despite this, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, and some start their lives as adventurers instead. The pull towards worthwhile challenges taking priority for them.": "此外，半龙的寿命比龙裔长得多，几乎能活上一千年，并超过了精灵的年龄。尽管如此，他们往往比精灵有更多的孩子，因此是一个快速消耗的种族，几乎和龙裔一样快。唯一让这个种族不至于压倒性地区的是他们往往有许多冲突。并不是因为他们一定是暴力的（尽管在一些半龙子族的情况下确实如此），而是因为他们是一个骄傲的种族，不回避挑战，经常迎难而上。再加上半龙族渴望变得更强并寻求挑战，他们往往过着危险的生活。为了扩大和增加他们的生存变化，半龙人通常会在他们漫长生命的早期阶段养育孩子，只有当他们觉得自己经历这种生活的时间足够长时才会去冒险，可能会把他们现在的孩子交给他们的配偶或家人照顾。他们漫长的生命使他们能够体验两种生活方式，半龙人冒险家有孩子在家里等着，或者在冒险生活结束后回到家庭的生活中，这并不罕见。然而，尽管他们声称，他们的冒险生活从未被真正抛在脑后，因为他们变得更强大的种族驱动力常常将他们再次推回到冒险中。尽管如此，半龙人是一个拥有强大个体的种族，有些人反而开始了他们的冒险生活。对他们来说，对有价值的挑战的吸引力是优先的。",
	"Alongside half silver dragons and half blue dragons, half red dragons are among the most numerous of half dragons. This has baffled many scholars, as red dragons do not have the love for humanity that, silver dragons have, nor the organization and family bonds of blue dragons. On top of that red dragons are infamous for their pride and desire to make achievements without the help of others. And ironically, while the half red dragons have the strongest desire out of all the half dragons to become stronger, they do work very well together. They are known as sea coast raiders, who pillage while sailing their longboats. While this is partially true, there are also more peaceful half red dragon villages. The half red dragons generally believe that they were formerly human tribes, who sought to create more half red dragon tribesmen to give them an edge in their many wars. They did this through temporary forged alliances with red dragons, whom they bought with gold and treasure. Over time their dominant genes spread, creating entire tribes of half red dragons.": "除了半银龙和半蓝龙之外，半红龙是半龙中数量最多的一种。这让许多学者感到困惑，因为红龙没有银龙对人类的爱，也没有蓝龙的组织和家庭关系。除此之外，红龙还因其骄傲和渴望在没有他人帮助的情况下取得成就而臭名昭著。具有讽刺意味的是，虽然半红龙在所有半龙中有最强烈的愿望变得更强大，但他们确实合作得非常好。他们被称为海岸突袭者，他们在驾驶长船时进行掠夺。虽然这部分是真的，但也有更多和平的半红龙村庄。半红龙一般认为，他们以前是人类部落，他们试图创造更多的半红龙部落成员，以使他们在许多战争中获得优势。他们通过与红龙临时结成联盟来做到这一点，他们用黄金和财宝收买红龙。随着时间的推移，他们的优势基因扩散，创造了整个半红龙部落。",
	"There are also groups of half dragons that work together with their full-blooded kin. The most notable of those are the half silver dragons, who are often raised in human settlements by their silver dragon family. These children are often the result of the silver dragon's fascination with humans, resulting in unions that create half silver dragons. Another group are the half blue dragons, who were intentionally created by blue dragon families, as they sought to create plentiful and loyal troops to serve them. Despite this ulterior motive, blue dragons are surprisingly good parents, treating their half and full-blooded offspring with equal affection. This generally results in half blue dragons being loyal servants and agents of their families. Despite being chromatic dragons, blue dragons are more likely to be mocking and manipulative than outright cruel or murderous to \"lesser\" creatures, which is why they love using hallucinations on travelers. The family always goes first, even if it means defying Tiamat. Because the dragons themselves already provide the brute strength to their forces, half blue dragons often become Stormscales; specialized warriors who perform key tasks. These include taking out spellcasters, who often pose the biggest threat to their full-blooded kin, assassinating key leaders, or using their incredible speed to surprise foes and take them headon. These Stormscales are fiercely loyal to their fullblooded dragon kin, to the point that blue dragons even trust them enough to allow them to be hired by those with sufficient gold. They are greatly feared by even the most powerful of wizards, as more than one spell caster has met a grizzly demize at the hands of a Stormscale. Stormscale are also known as honorable in many cases, rewarding those that have provided a service to their cause. This seems strange to many due to their blue dragon heritage, as they generally worship Tiamat. Many speculate that they have this code of honor due to pragmatism, as it allows them the best results to persuade others, as they often have enough riches. However, if those that have gained freely gifted scales from a dragon (blue or otherwise), and requests that these scales are interweaved into light armor, most Stormscale will ensure that they find someone who can do that for them. Despite being honorable, Stormscale will pragmatically eliminate anyone who might pose a threat to their family.": "也有一些半龙群体与他们的全血亲属一起工作。其中最引人注目的是半银龙，他们经常在人类定居点被他们的银龙家族抚养。这些孩子往往是银龙迷恋人类的结果，导致结合后产生了半银龙。另一个群体是半蓝龙，他们是由蓝龙家族有意创造的，因为他们试图创造出丰富而忠诚的部队来为他们服务。尽管有这种不可告人的目的，但蓝龙是出人意料的好父母，对他们的半身和全血后代有同等的感情。这通常会导致半蓝龙成为其家庭的忠诚仆人和代理人。尽管是色龙，蓝龙更倾向于嘲弄和操纵，而不是对 \"低等 \"生物直接残忍或谋杀，这就是为什么他们喜欢对旅行者使用幻觉。家族永远是第一位的，即使这意味着违抗提亚马特。因为龙本身已经为他们的部队提供了蛮力，所以半蓝龙经常成为风暴之鳞；执行关键任务的专门战士。这些任务包括干掉施法者（他们往往对他们的全血亲属构成最大的威胁）、暗杀主要领导人，或者利用他们难以置信的速度来突袭敌人并迎头赶上。这些风暴之鳞对它们的全血龙亲属非常忠诚，以至于蓝龙们甚至信任它们，允许它们被那些拥有足够金币的人雇佣。即使是最强大的巫师也非常惧怕他们，因为不止一个施法者在暴风女的手中遭遇了灰暗的死亡。在许多情况下，风暴之神也被称为是光荣的，他们奖励那些为他们的事业提供服务的人。由于他们的蓝龙血统，这在很多人看来很奇怪，因为他们一般都崇拜提亚马特。许多人猜测他们有这种荣誉准则是因为实用主义，因为这可以让他们有最好的结果来说服别人，因为他们往往有足够的财富。然而，如果那些从龙（蓝龙或其他龙）那里免费获得的天赋鳞片，并要求将这些鳞片交织成轻质盔甲，大多数风暴之神会确保他们找到能为他们做这件事的人。尽管很光荣，但风暴之神会务实地消灭任何可能对他们家族构成威胁的人。",
	"Half dragons get along the best with dragonborn, sharing similarities with this draconic race. However, unlike dragonborn, half dragons tend to be more individualistic due to their stronger ties to their draconic ancestry, despite their more humanoid appearance. Half dragons are also the ones most accepted within dragonborn communities. This despite the long tail that half dragons have, which is seen as a bad omen if it belongs to a dragonborn. Dragonborn see half dragons as fundamentally different, despite the similarities, and that would explain their tolerance for their tails.": "半龙人与龙裔相处得最好，与这个龙裔种族有相似之处。然而，与龙裔不同的是，尽管半龙的外表更像人类，但由于他们与龙裔的祖先有更紧密的联系，因此半龙往往更有个性。半龙人也是龙裔社区中最被接受的人。尽管半龙有一条长长的尾巴，如果它属于龙裔，就会被视为一个坏兆头。在龙裔看来，尽管有相似之处，但半龙在本质上是不同的，这也可以解释他们对尾巴的容忍度。",
	"Kobolds are often seen in an endearing way, thinking of them as comedic but still being respectful enough to them due to their usefulness. They will usually come to the defense of one because of this endearing feeling, unless the kobold deserves its misfortune which it often does. Half dragons can be annoyed with them from time to time. However, the kobold's valuable skills and devout worship makes these annoyances easier to overlook in the eyes of a half dragon.": "哥布林经常以一种可爱的方式被看待，认为他们是滑稽的，但由于他们的有用性，仍然对他们足够尊重。他们通常会因为这种可爱的感觉而为一个人辩护，除非哥布林的不幸是罪有应得，而它经常如此。半龙会时不时地对他们感到恼火。然而，哥布林有价值的技能和虔诚的崇拜使这些烦扰在半龙眼中更容易被忽略。",
	"They tend to get along well with most other races, though the drive and ambition that humans often possess makes half dragons gravitate towards humans more often than not. They are, however, wary of races that have unfavorable reputations based on past actions or beliefs. Yet, many half dragons will judge individuals based on their merits before deciding on an opinion about them.": "他们倾向于与大多数其他种族相处融洽，尽管人类通常拥有的动力和野心使半龙更倾向于人类。然而，他们对那些基于过去的行为或信仰而具有不利声誉的种族保持警惕。然而，许多半龙人在决定对他们的看法之前，会根据他们的优点来判断个人。",
	"There is an existing half dragon template, which is meant as a boon on top of existing monsters. The half dragon player race is different in both appearance and power. Where the template makes the creature look extremely dragonlike, the playable half dragon still has a very humanoid appearance. The half dragon can have the appearance of a dwarf or halfling if the mortal parent was one, though due to its larger size it would still be medium, as well as possess all the other half dragon traits.": "有一个现有的半龙模板，它是作为现有怪物之上的一个福音。半龙的玩家种族在外观和力量上都有所不同。模板使生物看起来非常像龙，而可玩的半龙仍然有非常像人的外观。如果凡人的父母是矮人或半身人，那么半龙可以有矮人或半身人的外表，尽管由于它的体型较大，它仍然是中等体型，并拥有所有其他的半龙特征。",
	"The term half dragon is also used as a reference to those who are descendants of such unions between dragon and mortal, and as such the name is a bit inaccurate when used in those cases. Regardless, it is a generally acceptable term when used to describe the more humanoid descendants of dragon kind.": "半龙这个词也被用来指代那些龙与凡人结合的后代，因此在这些情况下使用这个名字有点不准确。不管怎么说，当用来描述龙类的更多人形后裔时，这是一个普遍可以接受的术语。",
	"For those players that want to play a half dragon with wings, you can discuss the following option with your DM; access to the Draconic Heritage feat from the dragonborn:": "对于那些想扮演带翅膀的半龙人的玩家来说，你可以和你的DM讨论以下方案；从龙裔那里获得龙族遗产的特技。",
	"Most half dragons only possess a draconic tail and lower body, along with several scales on their upper bodies. However, there are a rare few who are blessed by the dragon gods (usually Bahamut or Tiamat) and are granted draconic wings. These blessings seem to be random, as even the most devout followers of Bahamut will find it unlikely that they would be blessed with them. Those who are lucky enough to be granted this blessing will often start with smaller or weaker wings, which need time to properly grow in size or strength. And, similar to the lesser dragon form, these wings will only further motivate them to ascend to dragonhood.": "大多数半龙只拥有龙族的尾巴和下半身，以及上半身的几片鳞片。然而，也有少数人受到龙神（通常是巴哈姆特或提亚马特）的祝福，被授予龙族的翅膀。这些祝福似乎是随机的，因为即使是巴哈姆特最虔诚的追随者也会发现他们不太可能得到这些祝福。那些幸运地获得这种祝福的人，开始时往往会有较小或较弱的翅膀，需要时间来适当地增长大小或力量。而且，与小龙形态类似，这些翅膀只会进一步激励他们升华为龙。",
	"Some half dragons are blessed by the dragon gods and may choose the Draconic Heritage feat (page 7) from the {@race dragonborn|CotDDPRaS} as their feat once, to gain the Wings trait of the Wayfarer subrace. This grants them draconic wings.": "有些半龙受到龙神的祝福，可以从（%0%）中选择龙族传统特技（第7页）作为他们的特技，以获得路人亚种的翅膀特质。这将赋予他们龙族的翅膀。",

	"The zekyl (also known as zekylynor) are the offspring of shadow dragons and their drow partners. The shadow dragons of clan Jaezred are infamous for creating half drow and half dragon children as infiltrators as they seek to destroy drow society from within and end the oppressive and cruel matriarchy that Lolth has forced upon the drow race. Though their reasons are less benign, as they seek to rule over all of drow kind themselves, while secretly living among them.": "泽基尔（又称泽基林诺）是影龙和他们的乌鸦伙伴的后代。杰兹瑞德（Jaezred）氏族的影龙以制造半乌鸦和半龙的孩子作为渗透者而臭名昭著，他们试图从内部摧毁乌鸦社会，结束洛尔兹强加给乌鸦种族的压迫和残忍的母权制。虽然他们的理由不那么善意，因为他们试图自己统治所有的乌鸦种类，同时秘密地生活在他们中间。",
	"As they grow stronger, they are able to ascend to dragonhood in a similar manner as half dragons are, and will become known as drow-dragons. However, due to the chaotic influences of the shadowfell, they are not truly half dragons themselves, as they are genetically closer to their elven lineage. Which is why, when ascended, they consider themselves an entirely different species.": "随着他们越来越强壮，他们能够以类似于半龙的方式升为龙族，并将被称为乌鸦龙。然而，由于阴影地带的混乱影响，他们本身并不是真正的半龙，因为他们在基因上更接近于精灵血统。这就是为什么，当升天时，他们认为自己是一个完全不同的物种。",
	"Due to the chaotic influences of the shadowfell, their appearance varies, but they always share some draconic characteristics. Unlike half dragons they do not have a natural resistance against an elemental type, but instead their shadow touched nature allows them to change their appearance, enabling them to infiltrate drow society from within. They are also far more likely to develop wings than regular half dragons are, which scholars believe is due to the influences of the shadowfell instead of a deity.": "由于阴影地带的混乱影响，他们的外表各不相同，但他们总是有一些龙族的特征。与半龙不同的是，他们没有对元素类型的天然抵抗力，相反，他们被影子触动的天性使他们能够改变自己的外表，使他们能够从内部渗透到乌鸦社会。他们也比普通的半龙更容易长出翅膀，学者们认为这是由于阴影地带的影响而不是神灵的影响。",
	"Similar to blue dragons, shadow dragons are affectionate to all of their children, shadow dragon or zekyl alike. Because of this strong family bond, most zekyl have an strong sense of loyalty to the shadow dragons that govern over them. Yet some Zekyl follow the deities Vhaeraun and Eilistraee, whom they consider allies against Lolth. While others become adventurers, who seek to leave the Underdark all together.": "与蓝龙相似，影龙对他们所有的孩子都很亲近，无论是影龙还是泽基尔都是如此。由于这种强烈的家庭纽带，大多数泽基尔人对统治他们的影龙有一种强烈的忠诚感。然而，有些Zekyl追随Vhaeraun和Eilistraee神，他们认为他们是反对Lolth的盟友。而另一些人则成为了冒险家，他们寻求离开暗黑世界。",

These communities either welcomed these children, or their draconic parents used their magic to alter their appearance. Over time, as these children mingled with other humans, the overtly draconic physical characteristics faded, leaving human-looking children with silver dragon bloodlines. Eventually, the dragons themselves departed, leaving behind a strong draconic heritage; a silver streak or highlights in the hair.

Nevertheless, kobolds are quite capable crafters and builders, if they are instructed well enough. And they have an uncanny natural affinity for tunneling and laying traps. Kobolds can live up to 120 years, but their tendency of almost comedically getting themselves killed means they rarely live that long. They are the most numerous of all the draconic races, and they are also renowned for their teamwork. When fighting alongside other kobolds they are also far less cowardly.": "当大多数人想到哥布林时，拥有龙人的祖先可能是他们最后想到的事情之一。哥布林生性胆小，道德地位比其他大多数种族要弱。因此，他们与龙人的祖先似乎没有什么共同之处。然而，如果得到足够的指导，哥布林是相当有能力的工匠和建造者。他们在挖掘隧道和布置陷阱方面有一种不可思议的自然亲和力。哥布林可以活到120岁，但他们几乎以滑稽的方式把自己弄死的倾向意味着他们很少能活那么久。他们是所有龙人种族中数量最多的，而且他们也以团队合作而闻名。当与其他哥布林并肩作战时，他们的胆子也小得多。",

His holy symbol, an unadorned circle, represents totality.": "阿斯哥拉斯，又称伊欧，是合法中立的创世龙神。他（或她，正如一些传统所建议的）被认为是多元宇宙和龙族的创造者。他通过运作方式操纵所有龙的命运，没有人怀疑他的参与。阿斯哥拉斯被认为包含了所有的取向，但通常被认为是中立的。在外层世界，他更多地被称为艾欧。他的神圣标志是一个没有装饰的圆圈，代表着整体性。",
	"Some sages believe that Asgorath is an aspect of the World Serpent concept, while others claim that Asgorath is actually a primordial that had ascended to godhood. Regardless, Asgorath is revered by dragons of all kinds. He is also worshiped by some half dragons, kobolds, lizardfolk, troglodytes, humans, and even a few dragonborn.": "一些圣人认为阿斯哥拉斯是世界之蛇概念的一个方面，而其他人则声称阿斯哥拉斯实际上是一个已经升为神的原始人。无论如何，阿斯哥拉斯受到各种龙的敬仰。他也被一些半龙、哥布林、蜥蜴人、troglodytes、人类，甚至是一些龙裔所崇拜。",
	"Asgorath has no enemies among the other gods, because of his neutral point of view. Even those of opposing alignments can find common cause under the banner of the World Shaper.": "阿斯哥拉斯在其他诸神中没有敌人，因为他的观点是中立的。即使是那些反对派也能在世界塑造者的旗帜下找到共同的事业。",
	"Bahamut is the lawful good dragon god of justice, good dragons, metallic dragons, wisdom, and enlightened justice (justice tempered with mercy and punishment with forgiveness). Bahamut is stern and very disapproving of evil, always arguing with Asgorath about his crusade against it. He accepts no excuses for evil acts, and doesn't tolerate even minor offenses by evil creatures. Despite his stance, he is also considered one of the most compassionate beings in the multiverse. He has limitless empathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed, and the helpless. He usually prefers to polymorph those who had offended him instead of killing them, although it is also said that Bahamut loathes to sully himself with the blood of evil creatures. By draconic standards, Bahamut is neither vain or desirous of treasure. He values wisdom, knowledge, prophecies, and songs instead. He uses the great wealth he has amassed over the ages to help those in need, while using the magic items he has gathered to further his goals. However, he also pursues viciously (usually sending his champions and followers) those who try to steal the hoard from his palace as, after all, he is a god of justice.": "巴哈姆特是合法的好龙神，掌管正义、好龙、金属龙、智慧和开明的正义（正义中带有仁慈，惩罚中带有宽恕）。巴哈姆特是严厉的，非常不赞成邪恶，总是与阿斯哥拉斯争论他对邪恶的讨伐。他不接受为邪恶行为找任何借口，甚至不容忍邪恶生物的轻微违法行为。尽管他的立场，他也被认为是多元宇宙中最富有同情心的人之一。他对被压迫者、被剥夺者和无助者有着无限的同情。他通常喜欢把那些冒犯过他的人变成多面体，而不是杀死他们，尽管据说巴哈姆特不喜欢用邪恶生物的血来玷污自己。按照龙人的标准，巴哈姆特既不虚荣，也不贪恋财宝。他更重视智慧、知识、预言和歌曲。他利用自己历代积累的巨大财富来帮助那些需要帮助的人，同时利用他所收集的魔法物品来推进他的目标。然而，他也会恶狠狠地追捕那些试图从他的宫殿里偷走囤积物的人（通常是派他的冠军和追随者），因为毕竟他是一个正义之神。",
	"Bahamut also likes to prove the strength and worthiness of his followers by battling against them in his dragon form, halting the combat when his followers are injured or when he overcomes them. However, he is prone to get carried away by his zeal, and has powerful healers on hand in case he has gravely injured one of his followers in those battles.": "巴哈姆特还喜欢通过以龙的形态与他的追随者战斗来证明他们的力量和价值，当他的追随者受伤或他战胜他们时，就会停止战斗。然而，他很容易被他的热情冲昏头脑，并有强大的治疗师在手，以防他在这些战斗中严重伤害他的追随者。",
	"While his court is comprised only of gold dragons, Bahamut enjoys the company of all good dragons, delighting in their differences and varied personalities.": "虽然他的宫廷只由金龙组成，但巴哈姆特喜欢与所有好龙为伴，喜欢它们的差异和不同的个性。",
	"Kurtulmak is the lawful evil or lawful neutral (depending on branch) patron god of kobolds. Interesting enough, there are two branches of worship that revere him.": "库图尔马克是哥布林的合法邪恶或合法中立（取决于分支）守护神。有趣的是，有两个分支的崇拜都敬仰他。",
	"The first one is practiced by the wild kobolds, who preach that Kurtulmak tirelessly drives kobolds to make war upon gnomes, in retaliation for a prank the gnomish deity Garl Glittergold pulled on him. This version of Kurtulmak is known to have neither compassion nor a sense of humor. Their symbol is a gnome's skull pierced with an iron stake.": "第一种是由野生哥布林实行的，他们宣扬库图尔马克不知疲倦地驱使哥布林向地精开战，以报复地精神灵加尔-闪金对他进行的恶作剧。众所周知，这个版本的库尔图马克既没有同情心，也没有幽默感。他们的标志是一个被铁桩刺穿的地精的头骨。",
	"The second branch is practiced by the more civilized kobolds, in which Kurtulmak is of lawful neutral alignment. It tells that Kurtulmak is a victim of a cowardly act by Garl Glittergold, but that one day their people will rise up and bring him to justice. Their holy symbol is the head of a kobold with golden eyes, and two crossed pickaxes.": "第二个分支是由更文明的哥布林实行的，其中库图尔马克是合法的中立派。它告诉人们，库尔图尔马克是加尔-闪金懦弱行为的受害者，但有一天他们的人民会站起来将他绳之以法。他们的神圣标志是一个有金色眼睛的哥布林头像，以及两把交叉的镐。",
	"The First story tells of how Kurtulmak decided to carve out a great cavern and rig it to collapse, whereupon he would then play a great jest; he would invite all of the other racial deities to the cavern for a feast, whereupon he would tell them the tale of \"The Violation of Tiamat's Lair.\" At the tale's end, he would pull out an ornate stone trigger and bury the assembled deities alive. The subsequent turn of events differs on whether the myth's teller is a kobold or a gnome, but either way Garl Glittergold stumbled across Kurtulmak's cavern and pulled the trigger, burying the God of the kobolds in his own trap. The kobold version insists that Garl Glittergold did so because he was jealous of Kurtulmak's creation, whilst the gnomish version claims that Garl admired Kurtulmak's work and pulled the keystone out simply to see if it worked.": "第一个故事讲述了库图尔马克决定开凿一个巨大的洞穴，并让它倒塌，然后他将玩一个伟大的玩笑；他将邀请所有其他种族的神灵到洞穴里来参加宴会，然后他将告诉他们 \"侵犯蒂阿马特巢穴 \"的故事。在故事结束时，他将拔出一个华丽的石头扳机，将聚集在一起的神祗活埋。随后的事件发展因讲述神话的人是哥布林还是地精而不同，但无论如何，加尔-闪金偶然发现了库图尔马克的洞穴并扣动了扳机，将哥布林之神埋葬在自己的陷阱里。哥布林人的版本坚持认为加尔-格莱特戈德这样做是因为他嫉妒库图尔马克的创造，而地精的版本则声称加尔钦佩库图尔马克的工作，拉出钥石只是为了看看它是否有效。",
	"The second story, as told by those kobolds that are more civilized, tells an entirely different tale: When Io gave the secret of creation to the first true dragons, the first dragon to use that secret was Caesinsjach, a green dragon. The first kobold was Kurtulmak. Caesinsjach chose to command her new creations through Kurtulmak; and he ascended to a position of leadership. When Caesinsjach told the kobolds to mine for precious metal, Kurtulmak invented the pickaxe When she ordered them to tile her lair with gold Kurtulmak Kurtulmak minted the first draconic coin. And when she told them to mine precious stones, Kurtulmak taught himself sorcery to divine where minerals were located. When Caesinsjach's lair was finished and she had become the wealthiest dragon in creation she let the kobolds go free. In emulation of his former mistress, Kurtulmak immediately began mining a lair for him-self. Although he never asked for help, every kobold he ever worked with came to his aid. Kurtulmak found a spot with a near limitless supply of metal ore and precious stones. With Kurtulmak commanding the operation, it quickly became the most structurally sound and resourcefully designed mine the world had ever seen. Kurtulmak called it Darastrixhurthi, a fortress fit for dragons. Nothing rivaled it. Garl Glittergold was not pleased. While his gnomes were playing useless games, the kobolds were busy working and were ready to emerge as a dominant race. And so with a wave of his hand, Garl collapsed Kurtulmak's mine, crushing all the kobolds inside. The other gods demanded an explanation but no deity came forward to reverse the damage done. Io, realizing that no god would help, found Kurtulmak still clinging to life. Even buried under the mountain he would not give up on his people. Io gave Kurtulmak a choice. He would empower Kurtulmak with the strength to rebuild the mine, or he would make the mighty kobold a champion of his people for all eternity. In this latter case, the loss of Darastrixhurthi would remain, but the memory of what happened would never be forgotten.": "第二个故事，由那些更文明的哥布林讲述的，是一个完全不同的故事。当艾欧把创造的秘密交给第一条真龙时，第一条使用这个秘密的龙是凯辛斯亚克，一条绿龙。第一条哥布林是库图尔马克。Caesinsjach选择通过Kurtulmak来指挥她的新造物；他升到了领导地位。当Caesinsjach告诉哥布林们开采贵重金属时，Kurtulmak发明了镐头 当她命令他们用黄金铺设巢穴时，Kurtulmak Kurtulmak铸造了第一枚龙族硬币。而当她让他们开采宝石时，库尔图马克自学了巫术，以占卜矿物的位置。当凯欣雅克的巢穴完工后，她已经成为造物主中最富有的龙，她让哥布林人获得了自由。为了效仿他以前的女主人，库图尔马克立即开始为自己开采巢穴。虽然他从未寻求过帮助，但每一个与他合作过的哥布林都来帮助他。Kurtulmak找到了一个有近乎无限供应的金属矿石和宝石的地方。在Kurtulmak的指挥下，它很快成为世界上有史以来结构最合理、设计最巧妙的矿场。库尔图马克称它为Darastrixhurthi，一个适合龙的堡垒。没有什么能与之匹敌。Garl Glittergold并不高兴。当他的地精们在玩无用的游戏时，哥布林们正忙于工作，并准备作为一个主导的种族出现。于是，加尔一挥手，崩塌了库尔图马克的矿井，压死了里面所有的哥布林。其他神灵要求解释，但没有神灵站出来扭转所造成的损害。伊欧意识到没有神会帮忙，发现库图尔马克仍在坚持生命。即使被埋在山下，他也不会放弃他的人民。艾欧给了库图尔马克一个选择。他将赋予库图尔马克重建矿场的力量，或者他将使这个强大的哥布林人成为他的人民永远的冠军。在后一种情况下，Darastrixhurthi的损失将继续存在，但对所发生的事情的记忆将永远不会被遗忘。",
	"All kobolds are far less fearful when fighting alongside their tribe, as they believe that when they die serving their tribe they will be reincarnated as the next egg laid in a hatchery. If a kobold dies serving its own need instead of those of the tribe, it gets reincarnated as the next pup born in the dire weasel stables. And if it betrays the tribe, it will reincarnate as a giant stag beetle. Those who die while sacrificing them-selves for the tribe are instead send to Kurtulmak's mine in heaven, and the most productive and loyal kobolds there will be reincarnated as dragons on the material plane. Those faithfully serving a dragon, without betraying their tribe, also gain these divine rewards. They live, they die, they live again.": "所有的哥布林在与他们的部落并肩作战时都会少很多恐惧，因为他们相信，当他们为部落服务而死时，他们会转世为孵化场里的下一个蛋。如果一个哥布林为自己的需要而不是为部落的需要而死，它就会转世为下一个在可怕的黄鼠狼马厩里出生的幼崽。而如果它背叛了部落，它将转世为一只巨大的雄鹿甲虫。那些在为部落献身时死去的人，会被送到天堂的库图尔马克矿场，而那里最有生产力和最忠诚的哥布林会转世为物质世界的龙。那些忠诚地服务于龙的人，没有背叛他们的部落，也会获得这些神圣的奖赏。他们活着，他们死了，他们又活着。",
	"Known as the Dragon Queen, Tiamat is the lawful evil dragon goddess of greed and evil dragons. She is the eternal rival of her brother Bahamut, ruler of the good metallic dragons.": "提亚马特被称为龙后，是贪婪和恶龙的合法恶龙女神。她是她哥哥巴哈姆特（Bahamut）的永恒对手，他是善良金属龙的统治者。",
	"Tiamat is arrogant, greedy, hateful, spiteful and vain. She never forgives any kind of slight, and is focused in obtaining more power and wealth. She disdains mortals, regarding them as mere disposable tools in her schemes. When needed, she is charming and fey, but her self-serving and reptilian personality betrays her sooner or later. Tiamat enjoys the company of male dragons, and has many great wyrm consorts of the chromatic varieties. She also has an insatiable greed for treasures but prefers that her followers bring it to her in the form of gifts instead of searching for riches on her own.": "提亚马特傲慢、贪婪、憎恨、唾弃和虚荣。她从不原谅任何形式的轻视，并专注于获得更多的权力和财富。她对凡人不屑一顾，认为他们只是她计划中可有可无的工具。在需要的时候，她很有魅力，很有风度，但她自私自利和爬行动物的个性迟早会出卖她。提亚马特喜欢与雄性龙为伍，并有许多色系的大巫妖妃子。她对财宝也有一种永不满足的贪婪，但她更喜欢她的追随者以礼物的形式把财宝带给她，而不是自己去寻找财富。",
	"Tiamat feels only scorn towards her brother, as she believes that dragons should dominate the world and rule over the lesser and weaker races. Nonetheless, if a mortal follower of her proves his worth, she will indeed bestow her blessings and strength upon him. Strength and independence are virtues she is always fond off, and she can even become fond of mortals without draconic blood in their veins.": "提亚马特对她的兄弟只感到蔑视，因为她认为龙应该主宰世界并统治较小和较弱的种族。尽管如此，如果一个凡人的追随者证明了他的价值，她确实会将她的祝福和力量赐予他。力量和独立是她一直喜欢的美德，她甚至会喜欢那些没有龙族血统的凡人。",
	"Dragons are known to be among the most powerful beings in the multiverse. As such there are few that seem to be able challenge their power. However, the multiverse is a fast place, and the enemies of dragon kind have more than one way of bringing ruin to the realms they believe are rightfully theirs.": "众所周知，龙是多元宇宙中最强大的生物之一。因此，似乎很少有人能够挑战他们的力量。然而，多元宇宙是一个快速的地方，龙类的敌人有不止一种方法来毁掉他们认为属于自己的领域。",
	"The primordials, or dawn titans, are god-like beings made of manifest entropy and elemental energy. Long ago, they used the dragons as slave-steeds in their war with the gods. Later on they were banished to their own world of Abeir and took several of their slave-steeds with them. There, the dragons rose up against their masters, and were even able to defeat them. Now they are the ones to rule over Abeir. Meanwhile, many dragons were left behind by the primordials, and became a dominant species in many worlds. The primordials still remain a threat however, as some have vowed to bring dragon kind back under their rule. They usually operate through cultists, to manipulate the draconic races and destroy them from within. These cultists pose themselves as virtuous, claiming that their dragon blood makes them tended towards evil, and that they must follow the cult for guidance and let the cult take care of them. Because of the draconic races their tendency towards valuing strength and independence, this has always met with little success. When manipulating the other mortal races against them on the other hand, they have had far better success, as they paint everyone who has dragon blood in their veins as tyrants to the other races. While many true chromatic dragons are indeed evil and must be slain, more than one innocent half dragon or dragonborn has been the victim of a hateful mob set up by primordial cultists.": "原始人，或称黎明泰坦，是由显性熵和元素能量构成的神一样的存在。很久以前，他们在与诸神的战争中使用龙作为奴隶的种子。后来，他们被放逐到他们自己的世界Abeir，并带走了他们的几个奴隶种子。在那里，龙们奋起反抗他们的主人，甚至能够打败他们。现在他们是统治Abeir的人。与此同时，许多龙被原始人留下，并成为许多世界的主导物种。然而，原始人仍然是一个威胁，因为有些人发誓要把龙族带回他们的统治之下。他们通常通过崇拜者来操纵龙族，并从内部摧毁他们。这些邪教徒把自己打扮得很贤惠，声称他们的龙血使他们倾向于邪恶，他们必须遵循邪教的指导，让邪教来照顾他们。由于龙族有重视力量和独立的倾向，这种做法总是收效甚微。另一方面，当操纵其他凡人种族反对他们时，他们的成功率要高得多，因为他们把所有流着龙血的人都描绘成其他种族的暴君。虽然许多真正的色龙确实是邪恶的，必须被杀死，但不止一个无辜的半龙人或龙裔成为原始崇拜者所设立的仇恨暴徒的受害者。",
	"Bazim-Gorag the Firebringer is an ascended primordial and chaotic evil elemental lord. His appearance is that of a froglike humanoid with red-gold skin and two froglike heads. Many of his followers are Slaad, due to him being the primordial of change. His portfolios are chance and chaos, and he is invoked by gamblers and anyone who wants the impossible. More often than not, his assistance comes at a too high price to pay. His worship is forbidden among the races of order, as he is revered as the patron of Chaos itself, and invoked by those who want a twist of fate no matter the dark price to pay. He poses a significant threat, even to dragon- kind, as his followers are mainly Slaadi. Slaadi are twisted frog like beings of pure chaos, and are renowned for their tremendous power and ability to multiply rapidly at the expense of other races. Fortunately they are usually only native to Limbo and the Supreme Throne, a fiendish plane in the World Tree cosmology. But that doesn't stop the primordial their cultists from trying to summon them into the material planes. With all the horrors that come with them.": "火焰使者巴兹姆-戈拉格（Bazim-Gorag）是一个升华的原始人和混乱的邪恶元素领主。他的外表是一个有着红金色皮肤和两个青蛙头的青蛙状人形。他的许多追随者都是斯拉德，因为他是变化的原始人。他的组合是机会和混乱，他被赌徒和任何想要不可能的人所召唤。更多的时候，他的帮助需要付出极高的代价。他的崇拜在秩序种族中是被禁止的，因为他被尊为混沌本身的守护神，并被那些想要扭转命运的人所召唤，无论付出多大的黑暗代价。他构成了巨大的威胁，甚至对龙族也是如此，因为他的追随者主要是斯拉迪。斯拉迪是像青蛙一样的扭曲的纯混沌生命，以其巨大的力量和快速繁殖的能力而闻名，并以牺牲其他种族为代价。幸运的是，他们通常只原产于Limbo和Supreme Throne，这是世界树宇宙论中的一个邪恶的平面。但这并不能阻止原始的他们的崇拜者试图将他们召唤到物质世界中。伴随着所有的恐怖，它们也随之而来。",

Those who attune to dragon scale armor made of these scales gain an extension of the dragon's very essence. Only rarely does a dragon willingly give up its scales, however, as it also grants the wearer immunity against that dragon's breath weapon. Equally rare are the daggers and other weapons made of gifted dragon fangs and claws. The Dragon-friend's Armor is especially sought after by druids, who are able to wear this armor due to its lack of metal.": "大多数冒险者都听说过龙鳞的非凡力量；然而，很少有人知道，相对于强行夺取的龙鳞，自由给予的龙鳞要强大得多。那些与这些龙鳞制成的龙鳞盔甲相适应的人，获得了龙的本质的延伸。然而，只有极少数的龙会自愿放弃它的鳞片，因为它也赋予穿戴者对龙的呼吸武器的免疫力。同样罕见的是用龙的獠牙和爪子制成的匕首和其他武器。龙友的盔甲尤其受到德鲁伊的追捧，由于缺乏金属，他们能够穿上这种盔甲。",

	"Half dragons? Yeah, total freaks, those guys. Imagine dragonborn but then more human. I guess some people will sleep around with just about anyone these days, even dragons.

Now, his look was hilarious!": "半龙？是的，完全的怪胎，那些家伙。想象一下龙族，但又更像人类。我猜现在有些人几乎会和任何人上床，甚至是龙。不过，我的队伍里也有几个，我对他们的结果无可辩驳。有一次，一条银龙在一个兽人劈开我的头之前就把他冻住了。现在，他的表情很滑稽。",
	"Many dragons are not only fearsome beasts, but renowned masters of magic as well. As such, it is not uncommon for one to change shape and walk among the masses, or even take a mortal lover. The children of such unions are known as half dragons. Not quite as monstrous looking as the dragonborn, but still very much recognizable due to its draconic traits.": "许多龙不仅是可怕的野兽，而且也是著名的魔法大师。因此，一个人改变形状，在大众中行走，甚至与凡人的爱人结合，这并不罕见。这种结合的孩子被称为半龙。虽然不像龙裔那样长相怪异，但由于其龙族的特征，还是非常容易被识别。",
	"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time.": "半龙看起来和它们的凡人父母非常相似，除了覆盖在它们身上的角和部分鳞片，以及它们的龙形腿和长尾巴。然而，半龙因其危险的元素呼吸，以及变身的天赋而更加出名。虽然只有少数半龙最终升为真正的龙族，但有些半龙被赋予了 \"较小 \"的形态，使他们能够在短时间内爆发出力量，并获得飞行的天赋。",
	"Half dragons' color patterns are similar to their draconic parent, and in the case of two half-dragons having children, the child is often born in the color scheme of either parent, though occasionally they instead look like one of the other draconic ancestors of the parents, as half dragons are strongly drawn to one another and known to quickly make families and communities. They are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet and being taller and heavier than females. They also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them.": "半龙的颜色模式与它们的龙族父母相似，在两个半龙生孩子的情况下，孩子出生时往往采用父母中任何一方的颜色方案，尽管偶尔他们反而看起来像父母的其他龙族祖先之一，因为半龙被强烈地吸引到彼此之间，并被称为快速建立家庭和社区。他们身材高大，体格强壮，雄性往往接近六英尺半，比雌性更高、更重。他们也会根据哪种龙族遗产对他们更有优势而获得优势。",
	"Half dragons share much of their draconic parent's strength, but they are also vulnerable in the early stages of their long lives. The lucky ones are raised by two half dragon parents, who raise them into protected communities. Others are abandoned by the draconic parent or both parents and forced to survive alone or hope they get adopted by other half dragons or by dragonborn. Though those with a metallic dragon parent are, more often than not, properly raised and cared for.": "半龙分享了他们龙族父母的大部分力量，但他们在漫长生命的早期阶段也很脆弱。幸运的人被两个半龙父母抚养长大，他们被养成受保护的群体。其他人则被龙人父母或双亲遗弃，被迫独自生存，或希望被其他半龙人或龙裔收养。虽然那些有金属龙父母的人通常都会得到适当的抚养和照顾。",
	"Those adopted by dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan and are raised to show strong loyalty to their clan. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the selfsufficiency of the dragonborn race as a whole, which is then reflected upon the half dragon. These half dragons value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. These dragonborn-raised half dragons hold mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal, alongside the desire to ascend to dragonhood. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn their respect.": "那些被龙裔收养的人被作为家族的一部分带入，并被培养成对其家族的强烈忠诚。对自我完善的持续驱动反映了龙裔种族作为一个整体的自给自足，这也反映在半龙身上。这些半龙人重视所有努力中的技巧和卓越。他们讨厌失败，在放弃某件事情之前，他们把自己逼到极致。这些龙裔培养的半龙把掌握一项特殊的技能作为终生的目标，同时也渴望升为龙族。其他种族的成员如果有同样的承诺，会发现很容易赢得他们的尊重。",
	"Eventually, all half dragons have a universal drive to become stronger. By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful. Such half dragons have \"ascended to dragonhood,\" and become true dragons with all their terrifying might. This true dragon form, however, is not easy to attain and requires great devotion and resolve. But those who succeed are held in very high regard by half dragon society.": "最终，所有的半龙都有一个普遍的动力，那就是变得更强大。通过以多种方式获得力量，他们发现自己与龙族的传统有了更多的接触，这一点以掌握其元素气息的形式呈现出来，甚至直接转化为龙。这种形式通常不像真龙那样强大，除非是那些真正虔诚而强大的人。这样的半龙已经 \"升格为龙\"，并以其所有可怕的力量成为真龙。然而，这种真龙形态并不容易达到，需要极大的奉献和决心。但那些成功的人在半龙社会中受到高度重视。",
	"In the most recent years, half dragons have been forming communities at an increasing rate. This has created many half dragon families, and in turn, many adventurers as well due to their drive to ascend to dragonhood. Usually, however, many half dragons start a family and have children, with the mother being encouraged to take care of the children while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. These communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to dragonhood and make for formidable opponents.": "在最近几年里，半龙人形成的社区越来越多。这创造了许多半龙人家庭，反过来也创造了许多冒险者，因为他们有升为龙的动力。然而，通常情况下，许多半龙人建立了家庭并有了孩子，母亲被鼓励照顾孩子，而父亲则出去养家糊口。如果母亲选择成为一名冒险家，那么祖父母或大家庭中的一员通常会照顾孩子。虽然他们的数量很少，但由于高生育率和大家庭，半龙人的数量正在迅速增加。这些社区受到他们长辈的保护，其中一些人已经升为龙族，成为可怕的对手。",
	"Half dragon names are usually based on the language of its mortal parent, as Draconic names are often much harder to pronounce. Some half dragons who are adopted within dragonborn clans will instead be given a dragonborn name:": "半龙的名字通常以其凡人父母的语言为基础，因为龙族的名字通常更难发音。一些在龙裔部族中被收养的半龙会被赋予一个龙裔的名字。",
