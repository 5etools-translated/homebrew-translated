Ivellios leads a small cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra in Lethyr. He carries a strong hatred for the Nentyarch, believing they have forsaken the elvish cause. He was instrumental in finding a way to use the demonic cysts that are buried beneath the Dale to allow Lossarwyn the Ice Lich to escape his confinement in Direwood.": "这种仇恨与Eldreth Veluuthra（见第9章）完全一致，他们是一个激进的精灵教派，试图将人类从Faerûn的脸上抹去。Ivellios在Lethyr领导着Eldreth Veluuthra的一个小团体。他对Nentyarch怀有强烈的仇恨，认为他们已经抛弃了精灵的事业。他在找到一种方法，利用埋藏在戴尔地下的恶魔囊肿，让冰封巫师洛萨温逃离他在迪瑞伍德的禁锢方面发挥了作用。",
