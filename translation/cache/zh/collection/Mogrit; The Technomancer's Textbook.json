There are countless portals to this digital world that people have sitting around in their pockets, their homes, or even in their heads.": "很难想象在互联网之前有什么生活。在每一个活着的（或死去的）人、每一件电器、汽车、路灯、以及文明的每一个平方英寸都与每一块相连之前的一个时代。即使没有星外领域，也存在着一个与肉体空间平行的世界，一个以二进制比特存储的数据海洋。有无数个通往这个数字世界的门户，人们在他们的口袋里、家里，甚至在他们的脑子里都有。",
	"This chapter provides the description and rules of utilizing technology to interact with this mirror world, allowing characters to browse the internet, enter it with virtual reality, break it through hacking, and more.": "本章提供了利用技术与这个镜像世界互动的描述和规则，允许角色浏览互联网，用虚拟现实技术进入其中，通过黑客攻击打破它，等等。",
	"The internet is a world-spanning telecommunication system that connects people, places, and things. The internet has become so ingrained in business and society that many cannot imagine a life without it. Its proliferation has bridged the gap between civilizations, cross-contaminating cultures in ways previously unimaginable.": "互联网是一个跨越世界的电信系统，连接着人、地方和事物。互联网已经在商业和社会中根深蒂固，许多人无法想象没有它的生活。它的扩散弥合了不同文明之间的差距，以以前无法想象的方式交叉感染了各种文化。",
	"However, this melting pot hides a seething cesspool just beneath the surface. It brings together people with dangerous ideologies, and allows malicious entities to prey upon victims on a global scale.": "然而，这个大熔炉的表面下隐藏着一个沸腾的污水池。它将具有危险意识形态的人聚集在一起，并允许恶意的实体在全球范围内掠夺受害者。",
	"Network is the generic term for a telecommunication system like the internet, but usually on a smaller scale. A local network ranges in size from a small family network for a few computers around a home, to a business network encompassing a huge multi-building complex.": "网络是像互联网一样的电信系统的通用术语，但通常规模较小。本地网络的规模从家庭周围的几台计算机的小型家庭网络，到包括一个巨大的多建筑群的商业网络。",
	"Typically, networks are protecteed from the rest of the internet with firewalls and other security mechanisms to keep data and resources from being vulnerable access and abuse from the rest of the world. Important networks that hold corporate or government classified information are even air-gapped from the internet, so there is no connection at all.": "通常情况下，网络受到防火墙和其他安全机制的保护，以防止数据和资源受到来自世界其他地区的脆弱访问和滥用。持有企业或政府机密信息的重要网络甚至与互联网隔绝，所以根本没有连接。",
	"A network can still cross large geographical distances, and even cross through sections of the internet with the help of cryptography to keep that information secure as it travels through uncontrolled space.": "一个网络仍然可以跨越很大的地理距离，甚至可以在密码学的帮助下穿越互联网的各个部分，以保证信息在不受控制的空间中传播时的安全性。",
	"In game terms, a network consists of the numerous, integrated mesh of connections between multiple machines.": "在游戏方面，网络由多台机器之间的众多综合网状连接组成。",

Machines can be connected to each other by universal cables or wirelessly, forming a network and allowing them to communicate information.": "几乎所有的现代电器和设备都有储存和使用它们所需信息的系统。机器可以通过通用电缆或无线方式相互连接，形成一个网络，让它们进行信息交流。",
	"For the purpose of these rules, a machine is an object with information processing or storage capabilities, such as a smartphone, computer, vending machine, flash drive, router, microwave, magnetic lock. A machine is not a building or vehicle that is composed of many other machines and objects.": "在这些规则中，机器是指具有信息处理或存储能力的物体，如智能手机、电脑、自动售货机、闪存驱动器、路由器、微波炉、磁锁。一台机器不是由许多其他机器和物体组成的建筑物或车辆。",
	"While even everyday items such as clothes, furniture, food containers, and dish detergent have tiny identification chips for the purpose of sales and inventory tracking, singular chips or circuit boards do not make an object a machine.": "虽然即使是衣服、家具、食品容器和洗碗剂等日常用品也有微小的识别芯片，用于销售和库存跟踪，但单一的芯片或电路板并不能使一个物体成为机器。",
	"A port is an interface that allows connection to a machine, and possibly to other machines connected to that machine in a network. A port may be a data outlet on a computer, a socket on the underside of a magnetic lock for maintenance, a receptacle allowing access to a vehicle's computer, or a small jack in a wall that connects to a network router. They may also be wireless in nature, allowing connections through a wireless signal to a machine, from one wireless chip to another.": "端口是一个接口，允许连接到一台机器，并可能连接到网络中与该机器连接的其他机器。端口可以是计算机上的一个数据出口，磁力锁底部用于维护的插座，允许进入车辆计算机的插座，或墙壁上连接到网络路由器的一个小插孔。它们也可以是无线的，允许通过无线信号连接到机器，从一个无线芯片到另一个。",
	"These ports are generally standardized for the sake of simplicity, and can be connected to with a universal cable or wireless transceiver. Almost all machines will have ports for access and maintenance, though they may not be immediately accessible to any passersby.": "为了简单起见，这些端口一般都是标准化的，可以用通用电缆或无线收发器来连接。几乎所有的机器都会有用于访问和维护的端口，尽管它们可能不会被任何路人立即访问。",
	"Many machines have wireless capabilities for flexibility and efficiency. Other machines with wireless capabilities may be able to connect to wireless ports. For example, you can connect your smartphone to a wireless router and send a command to open your garage if the door is on the same network as the router.": "许多机器都有无线功能，以提高灵活性和效率。其他具有无线功能的机器可能能够连接到无线端口。例如，你可以将你的智能手机连接到无线路由器，如果车库的门与路由器在同一个网络上，就可以发送命令打开车库。",
	"Wireless networks are often limited to certain areas, such as within a radius of a machine or the interior of a building.": "无线网络通常被限制在某些区域，如机器的半径范围内或建筑物的内部。",
	"Access to a machine may be limited to certain individuals who are granted keys, which let a user authenticate themselves to the machine and gain access. Often this is represented as a login screen, although it may appear more esoteric in VR. A key may be a password, an identification card, a fingerprint, a spoken word, or a combination of multiple factors. The only way to access a machine without having the key is to use hacking tools.": "对一台机器的访问可能仅限于某些人，他们被授予钥匙，让用户对机器进行认证并获得访问权。这通常表现为一个登录屏幕，尽管它在VR中可能显得更加深奥。密钥可以是一个密码、一张身份证、一个指纹、一句话，或多个因素的组合。在没有钥匙的情况下进入机器的唯一方法是使用黑客工具。",
	"There may be different levels of access, such as standard user and administrator, or specific accounts for each user. A standard user may not have access to all of the functions that an administrator has.": "可能有不同的访问级别，如标准用户和管理员，或每个用户的特定账户。一个标准用户可能没有权限使用管理员所拥有的所有功能。",
	"You may be able to access a machine through a terminal, such as a monitor and keyboard, or by connecting to it wirelessly or over a network. A machine cannot be accessed at all if it is turned off, or if it is not functioning for any reason, such as a nearby EMP.": "你可以通过一个终端，如显示器和键盘，或通过无线或网络连接来访问机器。如果一台机器被关闭，或由于任何原因（如附近的EMP）而无法运作，则根本无法访问该机器。",
	"With a datajack that has been surgically integrated with its brain, a creature can connect itself to a machine through a port. If a machine is connected to a network, then the user may also be able to gain access to it, and other machines on the network, or reach the internet.": "通过手术与大脑集成的数据包，生物可以通过一个端口将自己与机器连接。如果一台机器连接到一个网络，那么用户也可以访问它，以及网络上的其他机器，或者到达互联网。",
	"When connected to a machine or network with the datajack, the datajack uses VR technology to feed sensory input from the machine or network to the user's brain, simulating sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Organizations, businesses, and corporations will often develop virtual locations which range from realistic and professional to fantastic and bizarre.": "当用数据采集器连接到机器或网络时，数据采集器使用VR技术将感官输入从机器或网络输送到用户的大脑，模拟视觉、听觉、触觉、嗅觉和味觉。组织、企业和公司通常会开发虚拟地点，其范围从现实和专业到梦幻和怪异。",
	"A forum for religious discussion might be set in a medieval temple on a snowy mountaintop, while a business meeting might be set in a tranquil garden with a koi pond. In this space, creatures appear as their avatar, a representation of themselves in any form (subject to local protocols for decency and taste).": "一个宗教讨论的论坛可能设置在雪山顶上的中世纪寺庙里，而一个商业会议可能设置在一个有锦鲤池塘的宁静花园里。在这个空间里，生物作为他们的化身出现，是他们自己的任何形式的代表（要遵守当地的体面和品味的协议）。",
	"Basic machines, such as a vending machine, will often have no or extremely basic aesthetics, focusing instead on utility and control mechanisms. However, such machines in a network may be made a part of the network's VR experience, so that an elevator in a skyscraper in real life becomes a teleporter hub aboard a huge starship.": "基本的机器，如自动售货机，往往没有或极其基本的美感，而是专注于实用性和控制机制。然而，网络中的这种机器可以成为网络的VR体验的一部分，因此，现实生活中摩天大楼的电梯成为巨大的星舰上的传送枢纽。",
	"Be aware that connecting to a machine with VR is potentially dangerous, since your psyche is integrated with your avatar and partially uploaded to a network. Because of this, you can only be connected to one VR instance at a time. While you are in VR, you are still conscious and capable of your normal activity in the physical world. If you are disconnected from a network without properly exiting, you risk a psychic breakdown known as dumpshock. This may occur if, for example, the machine you've connected to is destroyed, the universal cable is cut, or you move out of range for a wireless connection.": "请注意，用VR连接机器是有潜在危险的，因为你的心理与你的化身融为一体，并部分上传到网络。正因为如此，你在同一时间只能连接到一个VR实例。当你在VR中时，你仍然是有意识的，能够在物理世界中进行正常活动。如果你在没有正确退出的情况下与网络断开连接，你就会有被称为dumpshock的精神崩溃的风险。例如，如果你连接的机器被摧毁，通用电缆被切断，或者你离开了无线连接的范围，就可能发生这种情况。",
	"After disconnection, you have 1 minute to reconnect to your avatar or you'll experience dumpshock. Your avatar is unresponsive during this time.": "断开连接后，你有1分钟的时间重新连接到你的化身，否则你会经历倾覆。在这段时间内，你的头像是没有反应的。",
	"Leaving VR is normally an easy task. It requires moving your avatar back to the machine's port you used to enter. However, should circumstances trap you in a network, you may have no choice but to use an action to manually eject from the simulation. If this occurs, your avatar is destroyed, and you experience dumpshock.": "离开VR通常是一个简单的任务。它需要将你的化身移回你用来进入的机器的端口。然而，如果环境将你困在一个网络中，你可能别无选择，只能使用一个动作来手动弹出模拟。如果发生这种情况，你的化身就会被摧毁，你就会经历dumpshock。",
	"When your psyche is separated from you, forcefully ejected from VR, or destroyed, you experience dumpshock. Dumpshock is a disorienting, painful, and possibly deadly illness that occurs as a mind attempts to rebuild its own psyche.": "当你的心灵与你分离，被强行从VR中弹出，或被摧毁时，你会经历倾覆性休克。Dumpshock是一种迷失方向的、痛苦的、可能是致命的疾病，它发生在一个人试图重建自己的精神世界时。",
	"A secured network may place destructive programs in the user's brain upon connection, essentially holding the user's brain as collateral for good behavior. If triggered by ICE from the network, or upon impromptu disconnection, these programs will heighten the dumpshock by harming you, either as a painful nonlethal warning, or in an attempt to render you braindead.": "一个安全的网络在连接时可能会在用户的大脑中放置破坏性的程序，本质上是将用户的大脑作为良好行为的抵押品。如果被网络中的ICE触发，或在临时断开连接时，这些程序将通过伤害你来加剧倾覆，要么作为一个痛苦的非致命警告，要么试图使你脑死亡。",
	"When you experience dumpshock, you immediately gain 1 level of exhaustion and become stunned until the end of your next turn. Depending on the situation which led to your dumpshock, you may also take psychic damage at your DM's discretion.": "当你经历倾倒时，你会立即获得1级疲惫，并被击晕，直到你下一回合结束。根据导致你倾倒的情况，你可能还会受到精神伤害，这由你的DM决定。",
	"Typically, being disconnected from online shopping will not be dangerous, but having your psyche destroyed by high powered corporate ICE could be lethal.": "通常情况下，与网上购物脱节不会有什么危险，但让你的心理被高能的公司ICE破坏可能是致命的。",
	"AR takes the real world and overlays it with multimedia information to make that world more visually interesting and functional. If a location is set up with AR objects or creatures, the physical world can be dressed up and altered, even putting objects or creatures in your vision that don't appear in reality. They can also be used to alter your own appearance, allowing you to change clothes or physical aspects of your body to others viewing you in AR vision.": "AR将现实世界与多媒体信息叠加在一起，使这个世界在视觉上更加有趣和实用。如果一个地点设置了AR物体或生物，那么物理世界可以被装扮和改变，甚至将现实中没有出现的物体或生物放入你的视野。它们也可以用来改变你自己的外观，让你向在AR视觉中观看你的其他人改变衣服或身体的各个方面。",
	"These objects and creatures can also be interactable, such as allowing customers to check out their own items without a store clerk or gain access to a building's directories. However, AR objects and creatures are similar to illusions; they are not capable of affecting the physical world except through their interactions, unless an effect specifies otherwise or a physical machines allows them to do so.": "这些物体和生物也可以是可互动的，比如允许顾客在没有店员的情况下自己结账，或者获得对建筑物目录的访问。然而，AR对象和生物类似于幻觉；除了通过互动，它们不能够影响物理世界，除非效果另有规定或物理机器允许它们这样做。",
	"In order to gain AR vision, you must have a means of doing so. You can activate or deactivate AR vision from your datajack, if you have one installed, at any time (no action required). Alternatively, you can wear specialized eyewear, such as sunglasses, goggles, or contact lenses, and gain AR vision.": "为了获得AR视觉，你必须有一种方法来这样做。你可以在任何时候从你的数据包中激活或关闭AR视觉，如果你有安装的话（不需要任何行动）。另外，你也可以佩戴专门的眼镜，如太阳镜、护目镜或隐形眼镜，获得AR视觉。",
	"While some might dip their toes in the pool of the internet, others embrace it as a tool, a career, or a weapon. Hackers are skilled at computer programming and traveling the data streams of the telecommunications grid.": "有些人可能会在互联网的池子里浸泡，而其他人则把它当作一种工具、一种职业或一种武器来拥抱。黑客们擅长计算机编程和穿梭于电信网络的数据流中。",
	"They use their hacking tools to search for important files, control remote computer systems, and tap phone calls. They can also utilize programs to clash with other hackers, admins, or ICE.": "他们利用黑客工具搜索重要文件，控制远程计算机系统，并窃听电话。他们还可以利用程序与其他黑客、管理员或ICE发生冲突。",
	"Valuable target machines and networks are often kept disconnected from the greater internet or other, less secure networks, requiring the hacker to first reach its physical location. Even for networks connected to the internet, attempting to approach a network from the outside means going through the most concentrated area of security devices and measures, making the attempt much more difficult than attempting to breach the network from an internal port.": "有价值的目标机器和网络通常与更大的互联网或其他不太安全的网络断开连接，要求黑客首先到达其物理位置。即使是连接到互联网的网络，试图从外部接近一个网络意味着要穿过安全设备和措施最集中的区域，这使得尝试比试图从内部端口突破网络要困难得多。",
	"It can be easy to spend too much time describing network VR locations, interactions, and ability check outcomes while the other players may be unable to involve themselves in the scenes. Hacking is meant to be an expanded futuristic equivalent of classic D&D navigation through locked doors and traps. If narration of network events are slowing the pacing down to a crawl, you can always opt out of describing situations in VR.": "花太多时间描述网络VR的位置、互动和能力检查的结果是很容易的，而其他玩家可能无法参与到这些场景中。黑客攻击的目的是扩大未来主义，相当于经典的D&D导航，通过锁定的门和陷阱。如果网络事件的叙述把节奏拖得很慢，你总是可以选择不在VR中描述情况。",
	"It's also important to note that hacking is not the only way to interact with machines and networks, especially in a VR setting. One cannot hack their way into finding the correct file in a vast database, that's more likely to be an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Technology) check. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma skills can be utilized in a variety of ways when interacting with systems, users, and AI. People and AI can be judged for their motives, persuaded, intimidated, or lied to as easily in a VR setting as in reality.": "同样重要的是要注意，黑客不是与机器和网络互动的唯一方式，特别是在VR环境中。一个人不可能通过黑客手段在庞大的数据库中找到正确的文件，那更可能是智力（调查）或智力（技术）检查。在与系统、用户和人工智能互动时，智力、智慧和魅力技能可以以各种方式加以利用。在VR环境中，人们和人工智能的动机可以被判断，被说服，被恐吓，或被欺骗，就像在现实中一样容易。",
	"There are also ways that Stealth or Sleight of Hand may be used, using Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma instead of Dexterity, at the DM's discretion. For example, quietly moving through a network without being noticed may be a Wisdom (Stealth) check to travel in a manner security are least likely guard against.": "也有一些方法可以使用隐身术或灵巧术，使用智力、智慧和魅力而不是灵巧，由DM决定。例如，悄悄地穿过一个网络而不被发现，可以用智慧（隐身）检查，以安全最不可能防范的方式旅行。",
	"While the normal hacking rules can be applied throughout a campaign to hacking activities ranging from breaking a vending machine to cracking open a high-security vault in a corporate bunker, there is room for additional complexity for DMs and players interested in differentiating hacking from other ability checks.": "虽然正常的黑客规则可以在整个战役中应用于黑客活动，从破坏自动售货机到破解公司地堡中的高度安全的金库，但对于有意将黑客活动与其他能力检查区分开来的DM和玩家来说，还有增加复杂性的空间。",
	"The following rules are meant for extended hacking sessions, such as breaking into a skyscraper and stealing research data or other heist-like scenarios, and not for simple activities like cracking the password on a smartphone. These rules allow the consequences of previous hacking attempts to carry over into the next attempt, heightening the difficulty the longer the hacker lingers on hostile networks, and placing the hacker in potentially deadly situations.": "以下规则是针对长时间的黑客活动，如闯入摩天大楼偷取研究数据或其他类似抢劫的场景，而不是针对破解智能手机密码这样的简单活动。这些规则允许以前的黑客尝试的后果延续到下一次尝试中，使黑客在敌对网络上逗留的时间越长，难度就越大，并使黑客处于潜在的致命境地。",
	"When utilizing these variant rules and making an ability check with hacking tools, if the total equals or exceeds 10, the ability check is a success. Otherwise, it is a failure. Furthermore, if the total is less than the target's alert level, then the hacker gains 1 lockdown point.": "当利用这些变体规则并使用黑客工具进行能力检查时，如果总数等于或超过10，能力检查就成功了。否则，就是失败。此外，如果总数小于目标的警戒等级，那么黑客就会获得1个锁定点。",
	"Similar to a Difficulty Class, each machine or network has an initial alert level decided by the DM which describes the state of security. Each attempt to hack the target will raise the alert level by 1. Special events, such as alarms going off or security being warned, may also raise the alert level. The hacker is aware of the current alert level of the target.": "类似于难度等级，每台机器或网络都有一个由DM决定的初始警报等级，描述安全状态。每一次入侵目标的尝试都会使警报等级提高1。特殊事件，如警报响起或安全警告，也可能提高警报等级。黑客知道目标的当前警报等级。",
	"Heightened alert levels are specific to the target machine or network, and will often remain in effect until 24 hours have passed since the most recent hacking attempt.": "加强的警报级别是针对目标机器或网络的，并且通常会保持有效，直到最近一次黑客攻击尝试后的24小时。",
	"For guidance on setting the initial alert level, look at the Typical Hacking DCs table above. Depending on the length and difficulty of the operation being attempted, it is suggested to subtract between 2 and 5 from the typical DC to get the initial alert level.": "关于设置初始警报级别的指导，请看上面的典型黑客攻击等级表。根据正在尝试的操作的长度和难度，建议从典型的DC中减去2到5来得到初始警报级别。",
	"Lockdown points are indicators of how close a target's security is to finding and eliminating you from its system. If the hacker gains 3 lockdown points, their lockdown points are reset to 0, their avatar is destroyed by the ICE and they experience dumpshock. If the hacker succeeds and is destroyed on the same ability check, they achieve their goal and their avatar is destroyed simultaneously.": "锁定点是一个目标的安全系统在多大程度上接近找到你并将你从其系统中消除的指标。如果黑客获得了3个封锁点，他们的封锁点会被重置为0，他们的化身会被ICE摧毁，并且他们会经历倾覆。如果黑客成功并在同一能力检查中被摧毁，他们就实现了他们的目标，他们的化身同时被摧毁。",
	"Lockdown points are specific to a machine or network, and do not carry over from one to the next unless the two targets are connected. In general, lockdown points remain in effect for a target until 24 hours have passed since the most recent hacking attempt, unless the DM says otherwise.": "封锁点是针对一台机器或网络的，除非两个目标是相连的，否则不会从一个目标延续到另一个目标。一般来说，封锁点对一个目标一直有效，直到最近一次黑客尝试后的24小时，除非DM另有规定。",
	"The hacker must return to the port that they used to enter in order to leave, as usual. However, while the hacker has 1 or more lockdown points, they are bound, and must succeed on a hacking tools check to exit VR. If the hacker gains the third lockdown point and succeeds on the same ability check to exit, they are still subjected to dumpshock.": "黑客必须像往常一样回到他们用来进入的端口才能离开。然而，当黑客拥有1个或更多的锁定点时，他们会被束缚，必须通过黑客工具检查成功才能离开VR。如果黑客获得了第三个锁定点，并在同样的能力检查中成功退出，他们仍然会受到dumpshock的影响。",
	"When you experience dumpshock, you immediately gain 1 level of exhaustion and become stunned until the end of your next turn. If you have any lockdown points, you take psychic damage based on the alert level and the target's ICE color.

	"A machine or network may employ different types of ICE. In general, stronger ICE is more expensive and difficult to configure, limiting who has access to the more powerful ICE. It also determines whether or not an intruder could potentially be physically harmed, or even killed by the ICE. This is a dangerous decision for an organization, depending on the local regulations of lethal ICE, and the possibility of deadly false positives.": "一个机器或网络可以采用不同类型的ICE。一般来说，更强的ICE更昂贵，也更难配置，限制了谁可以接触到更强大的ICE。这也决定了入侵者是否有可能受到身体上的伤害，甚至被ICE杀死。这对一个组织来说是一个危险的决定，取决于当地对致命ICE的规定，以及出现致命假阳性的可能性。",
	"Regardless of the ICE's appearance, there will always be a telltale display of their color. The color of an ICE denotes how dangerous it is to be caught and exterminated by it.": "无论ICE的外观如何，总会有它们的颜色显示。ICE的颜色表示被它抓住并消灭的危险程度。",
	"If nonlethal damage from ICE reduces a character to 0 hit points, they are unconscious and stable. Lethal damage may cause a creature to begin dying or kill them outright, as normal.": "如果来自ICE的非致命伤害使一个角色的命中率降至0，他们就会失去知觉并稳定。致命的伤害可能会导致生物开始死亡或直接杀死他们，如常。",

	"Admins are users with elevated credentials who defend their network from intruders by actively hunting them down. An administrator aware of the hacker may contest your hacking tools checks with their own. Instead of succeeding on an ability check with a total of 10 or more, the hacker must have a higher result than the admin. Each attempt increases the alert level and may cause the intruder to gain lockdown points, as usual.": "管理员是拥有高等级证书的用户，他们通过积极追捕入侵者来保卫他们的网络。管理员意识到黑客的存在，可以用他们自己的黑客工具检查来挑战你。黑客必须有比管理员更高的结果，而不是在总分10分以上的能力检查中取得成功。每一次尝试都会增加警戒级别，并可能导致入侵者获得锁定点数，和往常一样。",
	"While hackers are typically up against the admin when trying to invade a network, the same hacker may be put in the position of admin if their home or organizational network is attacked.": "虽然黑客在试图入侵网络时通常是与管理员对抗，但如果他们的家庭或组织网络受到攻击，同样的黑客可能被置于管理员的位置。",
	"In a situation where hackers, admins, or even AI are facing off, they can make contested hacking checks against each other to determine success or failure. If they are attempting to eliminate each other from a network or machine, the result of a contested hacking check may be the loser gaining a lockdown point.": "在黑客、管理员、甚至人工智能对峙的情况下，他们可以对对方进行有争议的黑客检查，以确定成功或失败。如果他们试图从网络或机器上消灭对方，竞争性黑客检查的结果可能是输家获得一个锁定点。",
	"There's an inherent risk with installing powerful computing hardware into your skull and linking it to your brain.

	"The roads, waterways, and skies of a city are constantly flowing with traffic, the lifeblood that keeps the whole show running. Whether it's a high speed chase, an illegal gun smuggling expedition, or a bout of vehicular manslaughter, vehicle stat blocks are necessary for a wide variety of situations. The following section describes vehicle stat blocks ranging from a plain four-seater car to aerial combat hovercraft, as well as instructions on how to create statistics for your own vehicles.": "一个城市的道路、水路和天空都在不断地流淌着交通，这是维持整个表演的命脉。无论是高速追击、非法枪支走私，还是车辆过失杀人，车辆状态块在各种情况下都是必要的。下文介绍了从普通的四座汽车到空战气垫船的车辆状态块，以及如何为自己的车辆创建统计数据的说明。",
	"A vehicle stat block includes many parts that are similar to creature statistics. They have hit points, armor class, speed, ability scores, and so on. This section covers the important distinctions between vehicles and creature statistics.": "一个车辆统计块包括许多与生物统计相似的部分。它们有命中率、护甲等级、速度、能力分数等等。本节涵盖了车辆和生物统计之间的重要区别。",
	"Vehicles have size categories similar to creatures, though there is not always a direct correlation between a vehicle's real world size and its size category. For example, in the real world, the average motorboat can be 15 feet long or more, but instead of being Huge, as a creature would usually be, it is a Large vehicle which would imply it is no longer than 10 feet if it were a creature.": "车辆的尺寸类别与生物类似，尽管车辆的现实世界尺寸与它的尺寸类别之间并不总是有直接的联系。例如，在现实世界中，一般的摩托艇可以有15英尺长或更多，但它不是像生物通常那样是巨大的，而是大型车辆，这意味着如果它是一个生物，它的长度不会超过10英尺。",
	"Instead of thinking of vehicles in terms of absolute lengths, the size categories are meant to be comparative for different classes of vehicles. Some vehicles are clearly larger or smaller than others. For example, Medium vehicles include motorcycles and jet skis, Large vehicles include cars and speedboats, Huge vehicles include monster trucks and helicopters, and Gargantuan vehicles include buses and yachts.": "与其用绝对长度来考虑车辆，尺寸类别是为了对不同类别的车辆进行比较。一些车辆显然比其他车辆大或小。例如，中型车辆包括摩托车和水上摩托车，大型车辆包括汽车和快艇，巨型车辆包括怪物卡车和直升机，巨型车辆包括公共汽车和游艇。",
	"Size is primarily used for determining damage in crashes and damage from attacks.": "尺寸主要用于确定撞车时的损害和攻击时的损害。",
	"A vehicle can be a land, water, or air vehicle, depending on the types of special movement available to them. A land vehicle moves or climbs across solid surfaces, a water vehicle has a swimming speed, and an air vehicle has a flying speed.": "车辆可以是陆上、水上或空中车辆，这取决于它们可用的特殊运动类型。陆地车辆在固体表面上移动或攀爬，水上车辆有游泳的速度，而空中车辆有飞行的速度。",
	"If a vehicle has more than one movement type, then the precedence of the vehicle's type is determined by whether it has a swimming or flying speed. Water takes precedence over land, and air takes precedence over land and water. For example, the floatplane has both a swimming and flying speed. The flying speed means it is an air vehicle, which takes precedence over its swimming speed.": "如果一辆车有一个以上的运动类型，那么该车的类型的优先权是由它的游泳或飞行速度决定的。水优先于陆地，而空气优先于陆地和水。例如，浮空飞机既有游泳速度又有飞行速度。飞行速度意味着它是一种空中交通工具，它优先于它的游泳速度。",
	"If a vehicle that lacks a swimming speed enters a liquid substance, it can't move and it begins to sink at a rate of 10 feet per round until it is removed from the liquid.": "如果缺乏游泳速度的车辆进入液体物质，它就不能移动，并开始以每回合10英尺的速度下沉，直到它被从液体中移出。",
	"The rider limit determines the amount of people that can comfortably inhabit a vehicle without squeezing, or without exceeding the safety equipment of the vehicle. For example, a car might have space for 5 riders, and any additional riders past the limit may have to squeeze in between other riders, sit on their laps, or even try and find space in the trunk.": "乘坐人数限制决定了可以舒适地居住在车辆中而不被挤压，或不超过车辆的安全设备的人数。例如，一辆车可能有5名乘客的空间，任何超过限制的额外乘客可能不得不挤在其他乘客之间，坐在他们的腿上，甚至试图在后备箱中寻找空间。",
	"The DM decides the exact penalty for exceeding the rider limit. For example, a creature squeezing between other riders or in awkward positions may suffer the effects of a creature squeezing into a smaller place: the squeezing creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against the creature have advantage against the creature. A creature lying in the trunk of a vehicle may have vulnerability to crashing damage. A second rider on a motorcycle may go flying off of it in a crash. Too many people standing on a boat may risk falling overboard in rough weather or in a crash, or even capsizing the boat.": "DM决定对超过骑手限制的确切惩罚。例如，一个生物挤在其他骑手之间或处于尴尬的位置，可能会受到一个生物挤在较小地方的影响：被挤的生物在攻击卷和灵巧救赎上有劣势，对该生物的攻击卷对该生物有优势。躺在车辆后备箱中的生物可能对碰撞伤害有脆弱性。摩托车上的第二个骑手可能在碰撞中飞出去。太多的人站在船上，在恶劣的天气下或在碰撞中可能会有落水的危险，甚至会翻船。",
	"A vehicle's capacity is the amount of weight a vehicle can carry without penalty. The weight of riders does not count against a vehicle's capacity, unless the DM decides that a rider is particularly heavy.": "车辆的容量是指车辆可以承载的重量而不受惩罚。乘员的重量不计入车辆的容量，除非管理部决定某个乘员特别重。",
	"If a vehicle's cargo capacity is exceeded, its fuel efficiency is decreased, the vehicle consumes 2 miles of range for every 1 mile it travels. If a vehicle is carrying more than twice its cargo capacity, its speed is reduced by half. If a vehicle is carrying more than thrice its cargo capacity, the vehicle can't move.": "如果车辆的载货量超过了，其燃油效率就会下降，车辆每行驶1英里就会消耗2英里的续航能力。如果车辆携带的货物超过其容量的两倍，其速度将减少一半。如果车辆携带的货物超过其容量的三倍，车辆就不能移动。",
	"A vehicle's range is the maximum distance a vehicle can travel on a full tank of fuel. Fuel for a vehicle can be a variety of fossil fuels, electricity in charged batteries, or another form of energy. Once a vehicle is out of fuel, it can't move, can't take actions or reactions, and if it would explode when it reaches 0 hit points, it does not.": "车辆的续航能力是指车辆加满油后可以行驶的最大距离。车辆的燃料可以是各种化石燃料，充电电池中的电力，或其他形式的能源。一旦车辆没有燃料，它就不能移动，不能采取行动或反应，如果它的命中率达到0时就会爆炸，它也不会爆炸。",
	"Most types of fuel are easy to purchase at a rate of 1 credit per 5 miles, and fuel stations are on every other street corner. Some vehicles may use nuclear reactors, or other futuristic technology, and acquiring fuel for them may be more difficult.": "大多数类型的燃料都很容易购买，价格为每5英里1个信用点，而且每隔一个街角都有加油站。有些车辆可能使用核反应堆，或其他未来主义技术，为它们获取燃料可能更困难。",
	"A vehicle has the six ability scores and modifiers: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.": "一辆汽车有六个能力分数和修饰物。力量、灵巧、体质、智力、智慧和魅力。",
	"A vehicle's Strength represents a combination of its size, weight, and the torque or power it can bring to bear. A vehicle's Dexterity describes its handling, braking, acceleration, and stability. A vehicle's Constitution embodies its durability, the sturdiness of its frame, and the amount of damage its internals can sustain before it ceases to function. Constitution also determines a system's internal resilience to meddling from spells and the sophistication of its targeting systems.": "一辆汽车的强度代表了它的尺寸、重量和它能带来的扭矩或动力的组合。车辆的灵巧性描述了它的操作、制动、加速和稳定性。一辆汽车的体质体现了它的耐用性，它的框架的坚固性，以及它的内部结构在停止运作之前所能承受的损坏程度。体质还决定了一个系统对法术干扰的内部复原力，以及其瞄准系统的复杂程度。",
	"Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and automatically fail any ability check or saving throw using those scores. One major exception are sentient vehicles, which typically have non-zero Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.": "车辆通常在智力、智慧和魅力方面的得分都是0，并且在使用这些分数时，任何能力检查或拯救动作都会自动失败。一个主要的例外是有知觉的车辆，它们的智力、智慧和魅力得分通常不为零。",
	"A vehicle has hit points, and will be destroyed if they are reduced to 0. A vehicle does not have Hit Dice. To restore hit points, the vehicle must be repaired.": "车辆有命中率，如果命中率降至0，就会被摧毁。要恢复命中率，必须对车辆进行修理。",
	"Vehicles each have a challenge rating, similar to monsters or non-player characters. When creating a vehicle, you can use a process similar to the 'Creating a Monster' section of the DMG.": "车辆都有一个挑战等级，类似于怪物或非玩家角色。在创建车辆时，你可以使用类似于DMG中 \"创建怪物 \"部分的程序。",
	"The primary difference comes when calculating a vehicle's offensive challenge rating. Many vehicles, such as cars or motorcycles, don't have weapons included in their stat blocks, since they have no weapons installed by default. For these cases it is recommended to calculate a vehicle's offensive challenge rating as though it has weapons installed; use the statistics for a melee weapon mount if the vehicle has a high Strength score, otherwise use the statistics for a ranged weapon mount.": "主要的区别是在计算车辆的进攻性挑战等级时。许多车辆，如汽车或摩托车，其属性块中不包括武器，因为它们默认没有安装武器。在这种情况下，建议计算车辆的攻击性挑战等级，就像它安装了武器一样；如果车辆的力量值很高，就使用近战武器的统计数据，否则就使用远程武器支架的统计数据。",
	"See the 'Vehicle Weapons and Damage' section later in this appendix for more information on arming a vehicle.": "参见本附录后面的 \"车辆武器和损害 \"一节，以了解有关武装车辆的更多信息。",
	"A vehicle's proficiency bonus is determined by its challenge rating, in a manner similar to monsters, as shown in the table below.": "车辆的熟练度奖励由其挑战等级决定，方式类似于怪物，如下表所示。",
	"A vehicle's proficiency bonus is added to the relevant ability modifier when the vehicle makes ability checks and saving throws with which it is proficient. It also adds it to ranged weapon attacks that the vehicle makes using its Constitution modifier.": "当车辆进行它所精通的能力检查和蓄势待发时，车辆的熟练度加成会加到相关的能力修改器上。在车辆使用宪法修改器进行远程武器攻击时，也会将其加入。",
	"Almost all vehicles explode when they are reduced to 0 hit points. Typically, targets near the vehicle must make a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage. The DC of the saving throw is 10 + the vehicle's Constitution modifier.": "几乎所有的车辆在被降低到0命中率时都会爆炸。通常情况下，车辆附近的目标必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作来减少伤害。蓄力的DC是10+车辆的体质修正值。",
	"The fire damage caused by the explosion is based on its size category, as shown in the Vehicle Explosion table.": "爆炸造成的火灾损失是根据其大小类别而定的，如车辆爆炸表所示。",
	"Vehicles can have many different types of actions and reactions, although they can't use them unless a driver grants the vehicle its action or reaction. A vehicle can only take the Attack, Disengage, or Ready actions. See Chapter 4 for more information on controlling vehicles.": "车辆可以有许多不同类型的行动和反应，尽管它们不能使用它们，除非驾驶员授予车辆行动或反应。车辆只能采取攻击、脱离或准备行动。关于控制车辆的更多信息，见第4章。",
	"A vehicle may have weapons installed on it through the melee or ranged weapon mount vehicle modifications. Alternatively, it may have special weapons designed for it that have their own properties. Any weapons and other special actions available to the vehicle fall under the Actions section of the vehicle's stat block.": "一辆汽车可以通过近战或远程武器安装车辆改装来安装武器。或者，它也可以有为它设计的特殊武器，这些武器有其自身的属性。车辆可用的任何武器和其他特殊行动都属于车辆状态块中的行动部分。",
	"Typically, when the vehicle's special actions and abilities, such as the floating fortress's railgun, force a target to make a saving throw, the saving throw DC is determined by using the following formula: 8 + the vehicle's proficiency bonus + the vehicle's Constitution modifier. However, some actions may use other ability modifiers.": "通常情况下，当车辆的特殊动作和能力，例如浮动堡垒的轨道炮，迫使目标做出蓄力动作时，蓄力动作的DC由以下公式决定。8+车辆的熟练度加成+车辆的体质修正值。然而，有些行动可能会使用其他的能力修改器。",
	"Vehicles may also have reactions available to them through modifications or special equipment, such as the attack helicopter's Decoy Flare.": "车辆也可以通过改装或特殊装备获得反应，如攻击直升机的诱饵信号灯。",
	"Some vehicles even have legendary actions. Vehicles with legendary actions require a driver that is proficient with the vehicle type to drive them, and can only take legendary actions while the vehicle has a proficient driver that is not incapacitated.": "有些车辆甚至有传奇性的行动。具有传奇行动的车辆需要一个精通该车辆类型的司机来驾驶，并且只有在车辆有一个精通的司机且没有丧失能力的情况下才能采取传奇行动。",
	"Vehicles may be equipped with mounted melee and ranged weapons. They can be standard weapons like those available as vehicle modifications, in the form of the Melee Weapon Mount and the Ranged Weapon Mount. Alternatively, they could be weapons specially designed for the vehicle, such as the VTOL warship or the war mech's weapons.": "车辆可以配备近战和远程武器。它们可以是标准的武器，比如那些可以作为车辆改装的武器，以近战武器架和远程武器架的形式出现。或者，它们也可以是专门为车辆设计的武器，如VTOL战舰或战争机械的武器。",
	"When determining the attack bonus and damage of a vehicle's standard Melee Weapon Mount, use the table below. The weapon usually deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, depending on the nature of the weapon.": "当确定车辆的标准近战武器装备的攻击奖励和伤害时，请使用下面的表格。该武器通常会造成打击、穿刺或砍击伤害，这取决于该武器的性质。",
	"Vehicle's Strength modifier + proficiency bonus": "车辆的力量修改器+熟练度奖励",
	"1d8 + the vehicle's Strength modifier": "1d8 + 车辆的力量修改器",
	"2d8 + the vehicle's Strength modifier": "2d8+车辆的力量修改器",
	"3d8 + the vehicle's Strength modifier": "3d8+车辆的力量修改器",
	"4d8 + the vehicle's Strength modifier": "4d8+车辆的力量修改器",
	"For the attack bonus of a vehicle's standard Ranged Weapon Mount, the attack bonus depends on whether the attack is made using the driver's Dexterity or the Vehicle's Constitution for the attack roll, as shown in the Ranged Weapon Mount Attacks table (driver chooses when they make the attack). The damage type depends on the weapon and ammunition.": "对于车辆的标准远程武器架的攻击加成，攻击加成取决于攻击是使用驾驶员的灵巧还是车辆的体质进行攻击卷，如远程武器架攻击表所示（驾驶员选择何时进行攻击）。伤害类型取决于武器和弹药。",
	"Dexterity": "灵活性",
	"Driver's Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus": "司机的灵巧修改器+熟练度奖励",
	"Constitution": "宪法",
	"Vehicle's Constitution modifier + proficiency bonus": "车辆的宪法修改器+熟练度奖励",
	"In addition, if the vehicle is Huge or larger, the vehicle also uses more powerful ranged weaponry, and thus can add its Constitution modifier to damage rolls for its ranged weapon attacks.": "此外，如果车辆是巨大的或更大的，车辆也会使用更强大的远程武器，因此可以在其远程武器攻击的伤害卷中加入其宪法修改系数。",
	"When creating statistics for a vehicle, it's recommended to use the vehicle's Constitution formula for determining its attack bonus. This makes it easier to standardize the vehicle for challenge rating calculation without having to make assumptions on the statistics of the driver.": "在为车辆创建统计数据时，建议使用车辆的体质公式来确定其攻击奖励。这使得在计算挑战等级时更容易对车辆进行标准化，而不必对驾驶员的统计数据进行假设。",
	"If your cyberpunk world has advanced beyond the need for roads and streets, then your vehicles will need to fit the environment. Such worlds may have cities filled with skyscrapers that rise for miles from deep pits where the sun cannot reach, or cities which hang from the underside of some great shell or creature, or even cities where the ground and the air near it is too toxic live upon, and so the rich and wealthy have constructed tall spires or anti-gravity islands to escape it. In such cities, traffic lanes become complex webs in the sky, moving between towers.": "如果你的赛博朋克世界已经超越了对道路和街道的需求，那么你的车辆将需要适应这个环境。这样的世界可能会有充满摩天大楼的城市，这些摩天大楼从太阳无法到达的深坑中拔地而起，或者城市悬挂在一些巨大的贝壳或生物的底部，甚至城市中的地面和附近的空气太过有毒，所以富人和有钱人建造了高大的尖塔或反重力岛屿来逃避它。在这样的城市里，交通车道成为天空中复杂的网，在塔楼之间穿梭。",
	"You can make any land or water vehicle into an air vehicle by making its flying speed equal to its walking speed. The DM can optionally reduce its walking speed to 0. If these rules are used, it is recommended to allow most people who would live in such cities to be able to drive air vehicles even if they are not proficient with them.": "你可以使任何陆地或水上交通工具成为空中交通工具，使其飞行速度等于其步行速度。如果使用这些规则，建议允许大多数生活在这种城市的人能够驾驶空中交通工具，即使他们并不精通这些交通工具。",
	"The following are a list of vehicles for use by player characters and non-player characters alike. The vehicles in this list are organized alphabetically, except for vehicles with similar functionality that can be grouped up.": "以下是一份供玩家角色和非玩家角色使用的车辆清单。这个列表中的车辆是按字母顺序排列的，除了具有类似功能的车辆可以归为一组。",
	"Of course, the vehicles presented here are simply those that come standard a production line. The DM is welcome to create their own vehicle using the rules in the vehicle stat block section, or customize one from the following list. Similarly, with the DM's approval, the players might create their own vehicles that suit their purposes using the same rules.": "当然，这里介绍的车辆只是那些标准生产线上的车辆。欢迎DM使用车辆状态块部分的规则创建他们自己的车辆，或者从以下列表中定制一个。同样，在管理员的同意下，玩家可以使用同样的规则创造出适合他们自己的车辆。",
	"For a vehicle's ranged weapon attacks, the listed attack bonus in the vehicle stat block is determined using the vehicle's Constitution modifier and the vehicle's proficiency bonus. When the driver grants the vehicle its Attack action, the driver may instead opt to use its own Dexterity and proficiency bonus.": "对于车辆的远程武器攻击，车辆状态块中列出的攻击奖励是用车辆的体质修饰和车辆的熟练度奖励决定的。当驾驶员赋予车辆攻击动作时，驾驶员可以选择使用自己的灵巧和熟练度加成。",
	"Also, as a reminder, vehicles do not have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks when creatures are within 5 feet of them. A samurai giving a gentle backscratch to a main battle tank with their katana is not going to alter the tank's aim.": "另外，作为提醒，当生物在其5英尺范围内时，车辆在远程武器攻击上没有劣势。一个武士用他们的武士刀给一辆主战坦克来个温柔的反击，并不能改变坦克的目标。",

	"Say what you will about the corporations, the cold streets, the garbage piled higher than your head, and the thick smog that clogs your lungs and makes your nose bleed. At the end of the day, the real problem is every other fucker trying to get ahead in life by using you as a stepladder.": "说说你对公司、寒冷的街道、堆得比你的头还高的垃圾，以及堵塞你的肺和让你流鼻血的浓雾的看法。在一天结束时，真正的问题是每一个试图通过利用你作为阶梯在生活中出人头地的其他混蛋。",
	"The city is packed to the brim with scum, and the worst of the lot looks back at you from the mirror. Every soul and soulless husk in this city has goals, whether it be to climb out of the heap of misery they live in, or to look out for the few bastards they care about, or just to survive.": "这座城市挤满了人渣，其中最糟糕的人从镜子里望着你。这个城市的每一个灵魂和没有灵魂的躯壳都有目标，不管是为了爬出他们生活的苦难堆，还是为了照顾他们关心的几个混蛋，或者只是为了生存。",
	"A living world needs inhabitants, and this appendix provides creature statistics and descriptions for numerous monsters and humanoids that fit into a cyberpunk world.": "一个有生命的世界需要居民，本附录提供了适合赛博朋克世界的众多怪物和类人生物的统计和描述。",

	"{@bold Weapons and Armor.} Anachronistic weapons and armor may or may not fit into your intended cyberpunk setting. If you want to modernize a creature, you can replace its ranged weapons and armor with simple and martial firearms and the cyberpunk armor equivalent. There is no difference in Armor Class between equivalent versions of medieval and cyberpunk armor.": "{@bold Weapons and Armor.}不合时宜的武器和盔甲可能适合也可能不适合你预定的赛博朋克环境。如果你想使一个生物现代化，你可以用简单的和武术的枪械以及赛博朋克的盔甲来代替它的远程武器和盔甲。在中世纪和赛博朋克盔甲的同等版本之间，盔甲等级没有区别。",
	"For example, there's no reason you couldn't create a gang of goblin street racers by simply altering the goblin stat block to replace their shortbows with pistols and their leather armor with steelcloth clothing.": "例如，你没有理由不通过简单地改变地精的属性块来创造一帮地精街头赛车手，把他们的短弓换成手枪，把他们的皮甲换成钢布衣服。",
	"Also, bear in mind that the smartgun augment and weapon accessory exists, so a creature with a high Strength score but a low Dexterity score can still used range weapons with its Strength, provided it would be able to get the correct equipment.": "另外，请记住，智能枪的增强和武器配件的存在，所以一个力量得分高但灵巧得分低的生物仍然可以用它的力量使用范围武器，只要它能够得到正确的装备。",
	"{@bold Spellcasters.} Mages, wizards, warlocks, and similar creatures are often very easy to reflavor into a cyberpunk equivalent with a wardrobe change, provided that magic is present in your setting. Volo's Guide to Monsters is a fantastic resource for these types of creatures.": "{@bold Spellcasters.}法师、巫师、术士和类似的生物通常很容易通过改变衣着来重新塑造一个赛博朋克的形象，只要你的环境中存在魔法。沃罗的《怪物指南》是这些类型的生物的绝佳资源。",

	"Some monsters could try to adapt and fit themselves into the modern society. An ogre could find a job as a bouncer for a club in a shady district, or a dragon might find ways to expand its hoard by becoming an executive of a major corporation. Demons and devils have never had such an ample supply of desperate souls willing to strike any bargain for scraps of power. And, of course, there may still be dark corners of the wide world where the sane fear to tread.": "一些怪物可以尝试适应并使自己融入现代社会。食人魔可以在阴暗地区的俱乐部找到一份保镖的工作，或者龙可能会通过成为一家大公司的高管来找到扩大其囤积物的方法。恶魔和魔鬼从未有如此充足的绝望的灵魂，愿意为权力的碎片进行任何交易。当然，世界上还有一些黑暗的角落，理智的人不敢涉足。",
	"The following are a list of creatures, their statistics, and descriptions for use in your campaign. They range from people you might encounter on the street or in offices, to the embodiment of nuclear fallout as a radioactive nightmare.": "以下是一份生物清单，它们的统计资料和描述，供你在竞选中使用。它们的范围从你在街上或办公室里可能遇到的人，到作为放射性噩梦的核沉降物的体现。",
	"You'll find a hierarchy of criminal scum, from the lowest street thugs to the bosses of organized crime syndicates. There are security forces, ranging in effectiveness depending on their training, equipment, and pay grade. There are a multitude of combat-ready operators who could act as opponents or allies to your players.": "你会发现犯罪人渣的等级制度，从最低的街头混混到有组织犯罪集团的老板。还有安全部队，其效力取决于他们的训练、装备和工资等级。有许多准备战斗的操作人员，他们可以作为你的玩家的对手或盟友。",

	"Of course, not every person in the city is a certified badass waiting for the player characters to step to them. As with medieval cities, most folks are just people trying to get by, even if it's politically incorrect to call them 'peasants' these days.

They don't need food, time off, healthcare, maternity leave, or a paycheck. Best of all, they don't question orders. Essentially, a drone is kind of like you, but better.": "无人机对各种活动都很有用。从制造，到运输，到打捞和清理，到让街道上的污物远离你的贵重物品，无人机可以做到这一切。它们不需要食物、休息时间、医疗保健、产假或工资。最重要的是，它们不会质疑命令。从本质上讲，无人机有点像你，但比你更好。",
	"Typically, drones will have been manufactured for a specific task, such as construction, serving, or manufacturing. They are then purchased and deployed for that purpose by an individual or organizaiton. Most will have no will of their own, being incapable of making their own decisions without first being told what to do.": "通常情况下，无人机是为某一特定任务制造的，如建筑、服务或制造。然后它们被个人或组织购买并用于该目的。大多数无人机没有自己的意志，在没有被告知要做什么的情况下，没有能力做出自己的决定。",
	"Of course, there are exceptions, such as in the cases of rogue drones abandoning their designated tasks and pursuing their own mysterious objectives. There are also cases where the control of a drone force is seized by an AI, whose commands they follow without hesitation. Such cases frequently result in violence.": "当然，也有例外，比如流氓无人机放弃指定任务，追求自己的神秘目标的情况。还有一些情况是，无人机部队的控制权被人工智能夺取，他们毫不犹豫地听从人工智能的命令。这种情况经常导致暴力。",
	"For Dungeons & Dragons purposes, drones are creatures that can be used in a manner similar to monsters, or as resources for the goals of the player characters, or even just as ambience for other events.": "就《龙与地下城》而言，无人机是一种生物，可以以类似于怪物的方式使用，或者作为玩家角色目标的资源，甚至只是作为其他事件的氛围。",

	"However, in order to stop the wholesale takeover of drones by any hacker at any time, they are typically given a set of instructions, and their ports, wireless and physical, are closed during normal duty hours. It's only when they are plugged in for charging or maintenance (or violently disabled) that they are openly vulnerable to malicious influence.": "然而，为了阻止任何黑客在任何时候全盘接管无人机，它们通常被赋予一套指令，它们的端口，无线和物理端口，在正常值班时间是关闭的。只有当它们被插上电源进行充电或维护（或被暴力禁用）时，它们才会公开地受到恶意影响。",
	"For hacking purposes, this means that a player character or other creature cannot simply hack into a drone's mind mid-combat and tell it to stop fighting, or turn on its owners. This is also true for AIs, but an AI has an advantage in being well placed to sneak into any vulnerable drone from a network.": "就黑客攻击而言，这意味着玩家角色或其他生物不能简单地在战斗中侵入无人机的思想，并告诉它停止战斗，或打开其主人。这对人工智能来说也是如此，但人工智能有一个优势，就是可以很好地从网络中潜入任何脆弱的无人机。",

	"An AI may serve numerous purposes for the DM and players alike.": "一个人工智能可以为管理员和玩家提供多种用途。",
	"For DMs, you may wish to create a situation in which a rogue AI has taken over a building and its defensive systems, allowing for interesting and challenging interactions with the player characters. Or perhaps an AI collects information on the actions of the player characters, and intends to blackmail them, or the AI is an indifferent, slumbering mind that must be awakened to perform a necessary task.": "对于DM来说，你可能希望创造这样一种情况：一个无赖的AI接管了一座建筑和它的防御系统，允许与玩家角色进行有趣的、具有挑战性的互动。或者，人工智能收集了关于玩家角色行动的信息，并打算敲诈他们，或者人工智能是一个冷漠的、沉睡的头脑，必须被唤醒以执行一个必要的任务。",
	"For players, not all encounters with AI need to be hostile. A favor performed for an AI may result in offers of information or assistance. Through a variety of means, an AI may be convinced to take up residence in a vehicle or a home computing system.": "对于玩家来说，并不是所有与人工智能的相遇都是敌对的。为人工智能提供的帮助可能会导致信息或援助的提供。通过各种手段，人工智能可能被说服在车辆或家庭计算系统中居住。",
	"Ultimately, an AI is a person, as unique and individual as any of us.": "归根结底，人工智能是一个人，就像我们任何人一样独特和有个性。",
	"An AI's appearance is a bit complicated. They will typically have an avatar of choice when operating in VR. Depending on their nature, the AI's avatar may vary in appearance from comfortingly humanoid to horrifically malformed and nightmarish, or anything in between, so long as it can 'adjust' the local network's limitations on avatar styles.": "一个人工智能的外观有点复杂。在VR中操作时，他们通常会有一个选择的化身。根据他们的性质，人工智能的化身可能在外观上有所不同，从舒适的人形到可怕的畸形和梦魇，或介于两者之间的任何东西，只要它能 \"调整 \"本地网络对化身风格的限制。",

The AI may be able to use cameras and microphones to see and hear events transpiring in the physical world.": "如果有AR投影仪，人工智能可能会出现在有AR视觉的人面前，并通过心灵感应或附近的扬声器与他们交谈。人工智能可能能够使用摄像头和麦克风来看到和听到物理世界中发生的事件。",
	"Similar to biological creatures, AI have statistics that define their capabilities and limitations. AIs are not gods, though some may seem all-powerful in a technologically advanced world, but they are not without their caveats.": "与生物类似，人工智能也有定义其能力和限制的统计数据。人工智能不是神，尽管在一个技术先进的世界里，有些人工智能可能看起来无所不能，但它们也不是没有注意事项的。",
	"They differ from typical creatures in many ways. For example, an AI is a digital creature, and will typically not have an AC, hit points, speed, size, or saving throws. Their statistics are described in the sections below.": "它们在许多方面与典型的生物不同。例如，人工智能是一种数字生物，通常没有攻击力、命中率、速度、大小或蓄力。它们的统计数据在下面的章节中进行了描述。",
	"An AI's category describes its data structure and composition. AIs fall into two categories: core and roaming. The two AI categories are distinct from each other in form and function, as described below.": "一个人工智能的类别描述了其数据结构和组成。AI分为两类：核心和漫游。这两个人工智能类别在形式和功能上是相互区别的，如下所述。",
	"This type of AI exists as a static creature resident in a special type of machine designed to be the core of the AI's existence. While it may be able to use its abilities to access and control numerous machines, drones, and vehicles, the essential aspects of an AI's being is in its core.": "这种类型的人工智能作为一种静态生物存在于一种特殊类型的机器中，旨在成为人工智能存在的核心。虽然它可能能够利用其能力访问和控制众多的机器、无人机和车辆，但人工智能存在的基本方面是在其核心。",
	"An AI can have more than one core, especially if it is high in scale. It is up to the DM how many cores an AI has, but typically an AI with a scale up to 5 has only one core, and the amount rises from there.": "一个人工智能可以有一个以上的核心，特别是如果它的规模很大。一个人工智能有多少个核心是由管理员决定的，但通常一个规模在5以下的人工智能只有一个核心，然后数量从那里开始增加。",
	"For a core AI, migrating from one core to another or attempting to add a core to its systems are long, difficult, and expensive processes, which are not without risk of failure. A core can also be shutdown, stored, and rebooted, with the AI inside it unconscious but unharmed for the duration.": "对于一个核心人工智能来说，从一个核心迁移到另一个核心，或者试图将一个核心添加到其系统中，都是漫长、困难和昂贵的过程，其中不乏失败的风险。一个核心也可以被关闭、储存和重启，里面的人工智能在这段时间内没有意识但没有受到伤害。",
	"This type of AI is more free-form than the core AIs. It is much less limited in its movements, using the processing power of systems it can access as it momentarily rides through them, from one location to the next. This type of AI is more likely to be magical or accidental in nature.": "这种类型的人工智能比核心人工智能的形式更自由。它在行动上受到的限制要少得多，当它瞬间穿越系统，从一个地方到另一个地方时，它使用它可以访问的系统的处理能力。这种类型的人工智能在本质上更可能是神奇的或偶然的。",
	"This is both a benefit, due to the heightened mobility compared to the static core AIs, and a potential downfall, since a roaming AI lacks a safe operating base. A roaming AI must commit portions or the entirety of its consciousness to a building or network if it wants to exert its control there, risking losing those aspects of itself, along with their memories.": "这既是一个好处，因为与静态的核心人工智能相比，它具有更高的流动性，也是一个潜在的缺点，因为漫游的人工智能缺乏一个安全的操作基地。如果一个漫游的人工智能想在一个建筑或网络中行使其控制权，就必须将其意识的一部分或全部投入到该建筑或网络中，这样就有可能失去自己的这些方面，以及它们的记忆。",
	"An artificial intelligence (AI) can be born in many ways. It may be developed for certain purposes by a well-financed research team, or coalesce from the ocean of running functions and processes on the Internet, or arise from the conjunction of spiritual energy and technology, or any number of other means.": "人工智能（AI）可以以多种方式诞生。它可能是由一个资金雄厚的研究团队为某些目的而开发的，或者是从互联网上运行的功能和程序的海洋中凝聚而成的，或者是由精神能量和技术的结合而产生的，或者是其他任何一种方式。",

	"{@bold Fey AIs} are often created by natural forces intermingling with high technology. These AIs typically act as tricksters and pranksters on the open Internet, although they are often bound by rules and etiquette that wouldn't be out of place in a fey Court.": "{@bold Fey AIs}通常是由自然力量与高科技交融而创造的。这些人工智能通常在开放的互联网上充当捣蛋鬼和恶作剧者，尽管他们经常受到规则和礼仪的约束，而这些规则和礼仪在翡冷翠的法庭上是不会过时的。",
	"{@bold Undead AIs} are rare creatures, which is probably for the best. Perhaps a user died in real life while connected to VR, and their avatar simply refused to give up the ghost. Or an AI might have been deleted, but traces of its innate magic continue its processes in a mindless effort to achieve the dead AI's goals.": "{@bold Undead AIs}是罕见的生物，这可能是最好的情况。也许一个用户在连接到VR时在现实生活中死亡，而他们的化身只是拒绝放弃幽灵。或者一个人工智能可能已经被删除了，但它与生俱来的魔法的痕迹继续其进程，无意识地努力实现死去的人工智能的目标。",
	"Please note that other AI types may exist, the ones listed here are only the most common. For example, if a world is affected by divine and demonic influences, there may be celestial or fiendish AIs.": "请注意，其他AI类型可能存在，这里列出的只是最常见的。例如，如果一个世界受到神性和魔鬼的影响，可能会有天神或魔鬼的人工智能。",
	"Is the AI the embodiment of hatred toward living beings? Does it ache to torture them until each aspect of their psychology is irrevocably shattered into a million pieces? Or does it instead want to use its vast processing capabilities to make the world a better place? Or just a sillier place?": "人工智能是对生物的仇恨的化身吗？它是否痛恨折磨他们，直到他们心理的每一个方面都被不可逆转地打碎成一百万块？还是它想利用其庞大的处理能力使世界变得更好？或者只是一个更愚蠢的地方？",
	"AIs can have alignments like any creature, or be unaligned.": "AI可以像任何生物一样拥有结盟，也可以不结盟。",
	"Depending on its origins, one AI may differ substantially from another. Its capabilities will depend on the AI's design and its purpose, as well as the computing power available to the AI.": "根据其起源，一个人工智能可能与另一个有很大不同。它的能力将取决于人工智能的设计和它的目的，以及人工智能可用的计算能力。",
	"An AI has the six ability scores and modifiers: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. An AI's Intelligence represents its cognitive abilities and processing power, as well as the accumulation of databases it can access. An AI's Wisdom and Charisma are similar in function to a creature's.": "一个人工智能有六个能力分数和修饰。力量、灵巧、体质、智力、智慧和魅力。人工智能的智力代表它的认知能力和处理能力，以及它可以访问的数据库的积累。人工智能的智慧和魅力在功能上类似于生物的智慧和魅力。",
	"Unless an AI can somehow manifest itself in the physical world, it will usually have a score of 0 in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. If an AI needs to roll initiative, it uses its Intelligence for the roll instead of its Dexterity.": "除非人工智能能够以某种方式在物理世界中表现自己，否则它的力量、灵巧和体质通常都是0分。如果一个人工智能需要掷出主动权，它会使用它的智力而不是它的灵巧来掷出。",
	"Instead of a creature's challenge rating or size category, an AI has a scale category, from 1 to 8.

	"{@bold Scale 1.} These AIs are typically barely on the edge of sentience, often little more than digital ghosts inhabiting singular appliances or machines. One computer experiencing a series of unexplained bugs and glitches may be work of one of these AIs.": "{@bold Scale 1.}这些人工智能通常勉强处于有意识的边缘，往往只是居住在单一电器或机器上的数字幽灵。一台电脑出现了一系列无法解释的错误和故障，可能是这些AI的杰作。",
	"{@bold Scale 2.} The most common form of an AI which provides a service, often in the form of a website, application, or program, or operates a single piece of machinery or vehicle. For example, an automated chatbot or shopping assistant may be operated by an AI in the background. Drones and other machinery may be controlled by an internal core AI.": "{@bold Scale 2.} 最常见的人工智能形式，它提供一种服务，通常以网站、应用程序或程序的形式出现，或操作单一的机械或车辆。例如，一个自动聊天机器人或购物助手可能由人工智能在后台操作。无人机和其他机械可能由内部核心人工智能控制。",
	"{@bold Scale 3.} These AIs often hold processing power or databases that take up an entire server rack and are capable of handling a multitude of functions at once. Such AIs are often marketed and sold as personal assistants capable of organizing and managing the complex daily lives of managerial or executive employees with mechanical precision.": "{@bold Scale 3.}这些人工智能往往拥有占用整个服务器机架的处理能力或数据库，能够同时处理多种功能。这类人工智能通常被作为个人助理进行销售，能够机械地精确组织和管理经理或行政人员的复杂日常生活。",
	"{@bold Scale 4.} A towering skyscraper is a hive of physical and digital activity that requires a large amount of computing power to orchestrate. These complex tasks are often left to be handled by AIs. An example of one such AI would be a security AI that manages authentication and access, cameras, drone patrols, scanners, trip lasers, and directing security personnel for a building.": "{@bold Scale 4.} 高耸的摩天大楼是一个物理和数字活动的蜂巢，需要大量的计算能力来协调。这些复杂的任务通常由人工智能来处理。这种人工智能的一个例子是管理认证和访问、摄像机、无人机巡逻、扫描器、绊脚石和指挥大楼的保安人员的安全人工智能。",
	"{@bold Scale 5.} At this scale, an AI is unlikely to be constrained to a single building. A research facility or college campus may use such an AI to collaborate with researchers and scientists for maximum efficiency. Alternatively, the scale may represent the power a magically infused AI might be able to leverage, rivaling powerful magi.": "{@bold Scale 5.} 在这种规模下，人工智能不太可能被限制在一个单一的建筑物内。一个研究机构或大学校园可以使用这样的人工智能来与研究人员和科学家合作，以获得最大的效率。另外，这个规模可能代表了一个被注入魔法的人工智能所能利用的力量，可以与强大的魔法师相媲美。",
	"{@bold Scale 6.} By networking together the combined processing capabilities of multiple blocks of urban area, or a large rural area, an AI's influence can expand to a point where it becomes difficult to contain or destroy. This is good news for military AIs, who may take up residence in the bunkers of a military base and develop plans and strategies for upcoming battles.": "{@bold Scale 6.}通过将多个街区的城市区域或大型农村地区的综合处理能力联网，一个人工智能的影响力可以扩大到难以遏制或摧毁的程度。这对军事AI来说是个好消息，它们可能会在军事基地的地堡里居住，为即将到来的战斗制定计划和战略。",
	"{@bold Scale 7.} These extremely powerful AI may call an entire city or rural state, or the equivalent of such spread throughout the world, its dominion. Or perhaps, instead of controlling landmass, the AI has a series of data centers that provide it with enough information to make predictions and estimations that border on foretelling the future.": "{@bold Scale 7.}这些极其强大的人工智能可能会称整个城市或农村国家，或相当于遍布世界的这些国家为其统治区。又或者，人工智能并不控制陆地，而是拥有一系列的数据中心，为它提供足够的信息来进行预测和估计，从而接近于预知未来。",
	"{@bold Scale 8.} At this scale, the AI is approaching near omniscience and/or omnipotence. Depending on its nature and desires, AIs of this scale may appear very different. A control oriented AI may hold sway over one or more continents like a tyrant king. An AI that seeks knowledge may hold access to the entirety of the world's collective information at its digital fingertips. And, of course, no one is safe from the epic pranks of a scale 8 trickster AI. No one.": "{@bold Scale 8.}在这种规模下，人工智能接近于全知和/或全能。根据它的性质和欲望，这种规模的人工智能可能会显得非常不同。一个以控制为导向的人工智能可能会像一个暴君国王一样控制着一个或多个大陆。一个寻求知识的人工智能可能在其数字指尖上掌握着整个世界的集体信息。而且，当然，没有人能够在8级捣蛋鬼人工智能的史诗般的恶作剧面前安全。没有人。",
	"An AI's scale isn't a permanent, set number, it may rise in accordance with increased level of resources and knowledge, or it may diminish as its reach is quarantined or its machines are cut off from its control.": "一个人工智能的规模并不是一个永久的、固定的数字，它可能随着资源和知识水平的提高而上升，也可能随着它的影响范围被隔离或机器被切断控制而减少。",
	"However, an AI is constrained by its capabilities and its nature. If a parasitic AI makes its way to the Internet, it doesn't immediately balloon to scale 8, because it doesn't have access to all of the resources the world has to offer, and security measures are in place to prevent exactly this sort of situation from happening. Instead, an AI that wishes to grow must expand its reach over time through manipulation of economics, information, and people.": "然而，一个人工智能受到其能力和性质的限制。如果一个寄生的人工智能进入互联网，它不会立即膨胀到8级，因为它没有机会获得世界上所有的资源，而且安全措施也正是为了防止这类情况的发生。相反，希望成长的人工智能必须通过对经济、信息和人的操纵来逐渐扩大其影响力。",
	"AIs, designed or otherwise, are often extremely capable in their areas of focus. Similar to any creature, an AI can be proficient with certain skills. For specialist AIs who have a high level of expertise with certain skills, the AI may double its proficiency bonus with the skill.": "人工智能，不管是设计的还是其他的，通常在他们的重点领域都有极强的能力。与任何生物类似，AI可以精通某些技能。对于那些对某些技能有很高的专业水平的人工智能来说，人工智能可以将其对该技能的熟练度加成翻倍。",
	"The AI can speak a number of languages based on the knowledge in its databases. With a decent sized database, many AIs of larger scale will know all languages. AIs often have a method of communicating wirelessly to creatures with datajacks in a manner similar to telepathy. The range dictates the distance the target of the communication can be from a machine the AI controls.": "人工智能可以根据其数据库中的知识说一些语言。有了一个相当规模的数据库，许多规模较大的人工智能会知道所有的语言。人工智能通常有一种方法，以类似于心灵感应的方式与有数据插口的生物进行无线通信。范围决定了通信的目标与AI控制的机器之间的距离。",
	"A creature can turn off it's datajacks wireless capabilities to shut out the telepathy. This telepathy also does not function in an area where wireless and radio connections have been suppressed by EMP or a similar effect.": "一个生物可以关闭它的数据包的无线功能来关闭心灵感应。这种心灵感应也不会在无线和无线电连接被EMP或类似的效果所抑制的地区发挥作用。",
	"Sooner or later, conflict is bound to arise between an AI and the player characters, or another faction, or even between two AIs. How does one go about resolving this conflict through violence or cunning?": "迟早有一天，人工智能和玩家角色之间，或另一派系之间，甚至两个人工智能之间，都会出现冲突。如何通过暴力或狡猾来解决这种冲突？",
	"The AI has no neck to cut and no hit points to damage, so it cannot be killed by conventional D&D means, but that doesn't mean it is immortal. An AI is still composed of one or more networked machines, and it has key vulnerabilities that the informed can exploit.": "人工智能没有脖子可以砍，没有命中率可以伤害，所以它不能被传统的D&D手段杀死，但这并不意味着它是不朽的。人工智能仍然是由一个或多个联网的机器组成的，它有一些关键的弱点，可以被知情者利用。",
	"An AI has many limitations on its actions in combat. Unless it has special equipment that allows it to do more, it can only take the Cast a Spell, Ready, and Search actions.": "AI在战斗中的行动有很多限制。除非它有特殊的装备可以做得更多，否则它只能采取施法、准备和搜索等行动。",
	"When an AI rolls for initiative, it uses its Intelligence for the roll instead of its Dexterity.": "当一个人工智能为主动权而滚动时，它使用它的智力而不是它的灵巧来滚动。",
	"Many AIs are capable of utilizing the same sort of hacking tools that any hacker might use. Some AIs are specially designed for that purpose.": "许多人工智能能够利用任何黑客可能使用的相同类型的黑客工具。有些人工智能是专门为此目的而设计的。",
	"Hacking tools can also be used against AI to try and contain or potentially destroy them. The following are some examples of ways that hacking tools can be used against an AI, depending on the scale and category of an AI, and they are typically contested by the AI's hacking tools if it is proficient with hacking tools, or the AI's Intelligence or Wisdom if it is not proficient.": "黑客工具也可以被用来对付人工智能，试图遏制或潜在地摧毁它们。以下是黑客工具可以用来对付人工智能的一些例子，这取决于人工智能的规模和类别，如果人工智能精通黑客工具，它们通常会被人工智能的黑客工具所争夺，如果人工智能不精通，则会被人工智能的智力或智慧所争夺。",

	"AIs are usually intelligent, dedicated beings that do not require sleep or nourishment, and may not quite understand the purpose of mercy or empathy. This makes them formidable, but not infallible.": "人工智能通常是聪明的、专注的生命，不需要睡眠或营养，而且可能不太理解怜悯或同情的目的。这使他们变得强大，但不是无懈可击。",
	"An AI has access to a limited number of machines, drones, and vehicles in its technological army, and each one destroyed may be difficult to recover, especially for AIs low in scale. An AI that suffers defeats that cost it a large portion of its resources may be reduced in scale, piece by piece, until what remains is no immediate threat to anyone.": "一个人工智能在其技术大军中能使用的机器、无人机和车辆数量有限，每一个被摧毁的机器、无人机和车辆都可能难以恢复，特别是对于规模较小的人工智能。一个人工智能如果遭受失败，损失了它的大部分资源，那么它的规模可能会一块一块地缩小，直到剩下的东西对任何人都没有直接威胁。",
	"Destroying AIs can be complicated, and it gets more difficult the larger their scale. It also depends on the AI's category, as described below.": "摧毁AI可能很复杂，它们的规模越大就越困难。这也取决于AI的类别，如下所述。",
	"{@bold Core AI.} Destroying the machine containing an AI's core destroys the AI itself, unless it has more than one core. Even then, the loss of a core is a devastating blow for an AI, and cause for its scale to be reduced. As an example, think of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey slowly being shutdown by removing HAL's core modules one by one.": "{@bold Core AI.} 摧毁包含人工智能核心的机器会摧毁人工智能本身，除非它有一个以上的核心。即使如此，失去一个核心对一个人工智能来说也是毁灭性的打击，并导致其规模缩小。举个例子，想想《2001年：太空漫游》中的HAL 9000，通过逐一移除HAL的核心模块而慢慢关闭。",
	"{@bold Roaming AI.} These AIs are more tricky to destroy, especially as they grow in scale. A roaming AI can enter or leave a local network in minutes, or more slowly if it wants to make itself difficult to detect. Higher scale AI, typically 6 or higher, can separate its functions and processes into redundant pieces and commit only what it thinks it can afford to lose into a risky excursion.": "{@bold Roaming AI.}这些人工智能更难消灭，特别是当它们的规模越来越大时。一个漫游的人工智能可以在几分钟内进入或离开一个本地网络，如果它想让自己难以被发现，则可以更慢。更高规模的人工智能，通常是6级或更高，可以将其功能和流程分离成冗余的部分，只将它认为可以承受的损失投入到危险的远行中。",
	"Still, if one can cut off or quarantine the entire AI, you can destroy it by purging it from the system while it is trapped. For the higher scale AI, you can trap or purge the local portions of the AI's consciousness and prevent it from returning to the AI's primary consciousness. This can damage the AI and cause it be reduced in scale, as well as cause it to forget memories and access keys.": "尽管如此，如果能切断或隔离整个人工智能，你可以在它被困住的时候将它从系统中清除出去，从而摧毁它。对于较高规模的人工智能，你可以困住或清除人工智能意识的局部部分，并防止它回到人工智能的主要意识中。这可能会损害人工智能并导致其规模缩小，以及导致其忘记记忆和访问钥匙。",
	"You can find a list of AIs on the {@filter Bestiary|bestiary|source=TTT} page.": "你可以在{@filter Bestiary|bestiary|source=TTT}页面上找到AI的列表。",
	"This appendix provides a number of variants to various rules throughout the book. The DM can choose to add one or more of these rules to their game.": "本附录为全书的各种规则提供了一些变体。管理者可以选择在他们的游戏中加入一个或多个这样的规则。",
	"When running chase scenes, racing scenes, or vehicular combat on a highway with other non-combat vehicles driven by civilians in the area, it can be difficult to manage so many different vehicles. Moreover, with such high speeds, it can seem jarring that between turns where the drivers can catch up to each other, they are more than a hundred feet apart when narratively they are racing along at nearly the same speed.": "当在高速公路上运行追逐场面、赛车场面或与该地区平民驾驶的其他非战斗车辆进行战斗时，管理这么多不同的车辆可能会很困难。此外，在如此高的速度下，在司机们可以追上对方的转弯处，他们之间的距离超过了100英尺，而在叙述中他们几乎是以同样的速度在飞驰，这似乎很刺眼。",
	"For these situations, its recommended to use ambient speed, or the speed at which all relevant vehicles in a scene move in the same direction on the same initiative count. For example, when playing out a chase scene on the highway, you can say that the ambient speed is 60 feet.": "在这些情况下，建议使用环境速度，或场景中所有相关车辆在同一方向上以相同的举措计数移动的速度。例如，当在高速公路上上演追逐戏时，你可以说周围的速度是60英尺。",
	"On initiative count 20, all of the vehicles in the scene use 60 feet of their movement speed to proceed in the same direction, or in the direction of traffic. If you're using a map or a grid on an 'endless road', this might mean that no movements need to be made at all for the vehicles. The remaining movement can be used on the driver's turns for movement as normal, such as the remaining 70 feet of movement from a motorcycle's speed of 130.": "在主动计数20时，场景中的所有车辆都用60英尺的移动速度向同一方向前进，或向交通方向前进。如果你使用的是地图或网格上的 \"无尽路\"，这可能意味着车辆根本不需要做任何移动。剩余的移动可以在驾驶员的回合中用于正常的移动，例如摩托车的速度为130，剩余70英尺的移动。",
	"On the other hand, creatures not on vehicles, having been pushed off or gotten out of their vehicles do not move. Drivers can also make a choice to attempt to break out of ambient speed and try something fancy, or try to move against the flow of traffic. This may require a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check from the vehicle for this fancy driving, at the DM's discretion. Failure, or moving to a place in front of another vehicle may possibly result in a crash if the vehicle would move into another vehicle or creature with their ambient movement speed. It can create fun moments where a creature is pushed in front of some random vehicle on a highway, and have that vehicle's momentum from ambient speed crash into the creature.": "另一方面，不在车辆上的生物，被推下或从车辆上下来后，也不会移动。驾驶员也可以做出选择，试图突破环境速度，尝试一些花哨的东西，或者试图逆向行驶。这可能需要车辆对这种花式驾驶进行灵巧（杂技）检查，由DM决定。如果失败，或者移动到另一辆车的前面，可能会导致撞车，如果该车会以其周围的移动速度移动到另一辆车或生物中。这可以创造出有趣的时刻，在高速公路上，一个生物被推到一些随机的车辆前面，让那辆车以环境速度的势头撞上这个生物。",
	"Some artificer features are affected by the number of magic items that the artificer is attuned to.

	"If drugs are a bit too rewarding and don't have enough risk, you can apply the burnout condition to any creature at addiction level 3.": "如果毒品的奖励有点多，而且风险不够大，你可以对任何成瘾程度为3的生物适用倦怠条件。",
	"The burnout condition has the following effects:": "倦怠状态有以下影响。",
	"At the end of a long rest, a creature with this condition has its maximum hit points reduced by 1d6.": "在长期休息结束时，具有这种状况的生物的最大命中率会减少1d6。",

These follow the same general set of rules as normal hacking, such as having to connect to the target machine or network with a universal cable or wirelessly. However, if a datajack is no longer involved in the process, then VR, dumpshock, and related facets of technology may no longer be a factor.": "你可以不使用安装在你大脑中的黑客工具增强器，而是使用外部形式的黑客工具。你可以购买并携带这种专门的机器，就像你购买任何一套工具一样。这些工具遵循与普通黑客相同的一般规则，例如必须用通用电缆或无线方式连接到目标机器或网络。然而，如果在这个过程中不再涉及数据黑客，那么VR、dumpshock和相关的技术层面可能不再是一个因素。",

	"In addition to its normal uses, inspiration allows you to perform a flashback to take action to impact your current situation.

	"Luck points from your lifestyle are based on the Lucky feat, but they are not restored when you finish a long rest. If you have the Lucky feat, the luck points from your lifestyle are added to your other luck points if you have the Lucky feat, and you choose which source of luck point you use when you spend it.": "来自你的生活方式的幸运点是基于幸运特技的，但是当你完成一个长时间的休息时，它们不会被恢复。如果你有幸运特技，你的生活方式中的幸运点会加到你的其他幸运点上，你可以选择在花费幸运点时使用哪个来源。",

	"This variant of the rule for short rests is intended for use in high-stakes, swift operations where the player characters will have no chance of finding a full hour to settle down and recuperate.

	"The College of Anarchy is less a place and more a state of mind. It is a rejection of oppressive governments, of soulless megacorporations, and of any shithead that wants to tell you what to do.

	"Like any form of organization, corporate hierarchies take many forms. For some corporations, the corporation is a family business. The sons and daughters of executives are bred and trained for succession, the money passed down the bloodline. For other corporations, promotions are merit- based.

	"Not all firearms are created equally. The average pistol a street thug is carrying may be dented, its sights off-center, its barrel corroded with traces of rust.
