	"It is unknown when the age of the ancients began, but most researchers and scholars believe it started when the first races experienced death for the first time. Having been immortal before time began, the first races feared this unending sleep and prayed to the Five who blessed them with these forms to save them. The Aspects heard their plight and were crushed to see the pain in the hearts of the first races, and so the Aspects sought to ease their suffering. First, by extending the life of the halflings by a hundred years or so, hoping that this extended time would ease their pain before the unending sleep. To their dismay, it only prolonged the inevitable. The Aspects continued to experiment, extending the life of dwarves, gnomes, elves, and lastly the wyverians far beyond that of humans, but they found it was not within their power to extend the life of the first races indefinitely, but they could mold it. Death was not the end, but instead it was the beginning and end of a cycle. When a creature died, the Aspects welcomed the first races and all other creations of the five to the Outer Planes where they remained until they were infused with new life and returned to the material plane. This is commonly referred to as \"The Wheel.\"": "古人的时代是什么时候开始的不得而知，但大多数研究人员和学者认为它是在第一批种族第一次经历死亡时开始的。在时间开始之前就已经是不朽的了，第一批种族害怕这种无休止的睡眠，并向赐予他们这些形式的五人组祈祷，以拯救他们。诸神听到了他们的困境，看到第一个种族心中的痛苦而感到震惊，因此诸神试图减轻他们的痛苦。首先，将半身人的寿命延长了一百年左右，希望这个延长的时间能减轻他们在无尽的睡眠前的痛苦。令他们沮丧的是，这只是延长了不可避免的时间。方面军继续进行实验，延长了矮人、地精、精灵和最后的维维人的寿命，远远超过了人类的寿命，但他们发现他们没有能力无限期地延长第一批种族的寿命，但他们可以塑造它。死亡不是结束，而是一个周期的开始和结束。当一个生物死亡时，本体欢迎第一种族和所有其他五行的创造物到外部星球，在那里他们一直呆着，直到他们被注入新的生命并回到物质界。这通常被称为 \"轮回\"。",
	"But the Wheel was flawed. Unknown to the Aspects, the twisting and contorting of the Five's original creation had corrupted it. This corruption slowly seeped into the pores of the Outer Plane, forming the Fatalis, the lord of the newly formed Lower Planes. Thought to be created by the mixing of energy between Limbo, the Abyss, and the Nine Hells the Fatalis sought to destroy and recreate in its own image. In the beginning it started small, first influencing small monsters making them rabid and territorial. The harmony of nature had been broken, but the Aspects did not take notice. their concern for the first races blinded them to small changes in the world. As the wheel turned, the Fatalis grew in power and began twisting and contorting the monsters under its command into the first demons.": "但转轮是有缺陷的。各个方面都不知道，五人最初创造时的扭曲和变形已经破坏了它。这种腐蚀慢慢地渗入外部世界的毛孔，形成了法塔利斯，新形成的低层世界的主宰。它被认为是由Limbo、深渊和九层地狱之间的能量混合而产生的，Fatalis试图按照自己的形象进行破坏和重新创造。一开始，它从小处着手，首先影响小怪物，使它们变得狂暴和具有领土性。自然界的和谐被打破了，但各方面并没有注意到。他们对第一批种族的关注使他们对世界的微小变化视而不见。随着轮子的转动，法塔利斯的力量越来越大，并开始将其指挥下的怪物扭曲变形，成为第一批魔物。",
	"Next it moved its sights to the first races, offering power and knowledge to the weakest of them. The ones who accepted the Fatalis's offer became the first devils. The ones who attempted to resist the Fatalis but failed, were twisted into the monstrous races like the orcs, goblins, or kobolds.": "接下来，它把目光转向了第一批种族，向他们中最弱小的种族提供力量和知识。接受Fatalis提议的人成为第一批魔鬼。那些试图抵抗法塔利斯但失败的人被扭曲成了兽人、哥布林或哥布林这样的畸形种族。",

Monsters and humanoids alike were being slaughtered, forests were burning, mountains were demolished, and seas became sand. The War of the Ancients had begun.": "当这些对自然的憎恶侵入五人的创作时，各方面都惊恐地看着。怪物和人类都被屠杀，森林在燃烧，山脉被拆毁，海洋变成了沙子。古代人的战争已经开始。",
	"The War of the Ancients threatened to undo everything the Five created. The battle took place across all creation and the Aspects were unable to focus their assistance in just one area. So they shared their knowledge with the first races, showing them how to fortify themselves by creating walled settlements. They taught them how to harness the nature around them to fight, how to bend the earth to their will, use the bodies of fallen monsters to strengthen themselves,harness the destructive power of the magic they possessed, and work with the uncorrupted monsters of the world. A century went by, but inch by inch the monsters and first races forged ahead together. They pushed back the corruption from the world, winning skirmish after skirmish until the emergence of a new threat.": "古人的战争威胁到了五人组所创造的一切。这场战役发生在所有的造物主身上，而方面军无法将他们的援助仅仅集中在一个地区。因此，他们与最初的种族分享他们的知识，告诉他们如何通过建立围墙定居点来加固自己。他们教他们如何利用周围的自然环境来战斗，如何使大地屈服于他们的意志，利用堕落的怪物的身体来加强自己，利用他们拥有的魔法的破坏力，并与世界上未被腐蚀的怪物合作。一个世纪过去了，但怪物们和第一种族一起一寸一寸地向前迈进。他们击退了世界上的腐败，赢得了一场又一场的小规模战斗，直到出现了新的威胁。",
	"The Fatalis released its generals across the Material and Upper Planes. Created from granting its most powerful warriors fused with its own essence, the Archdevils were theones to invade the Upper Planes in an attempt to break the Wheel and spread the corruption further. On the material plane Demon Lords, created from elder dragons under its influence of the Fatalis, trampled armies and once again threatened the existence of the Five's creation. With hope wanning, the first races once again turned to the Aspects again, praying for assistance.": "法塔利斯在物质世界和上层世界释放了它的将军们。大恶魔是由授予它最强大的战士与它自己的精髓融合而成的，他们入侵上层世界，试图打破轮回并进一步传播腐败。在物质层面上，恶魔领主是在法塔利斯的影响下由长老龙创造出来的，他们践踏军队，并再次威胁到五神创造物的存在。随着希望的破灭，第一批种族再次求助于本体，祈求援助。",
	"It was never in the Aspect's power to grant immortality to all of the first races and they knew that, but it was within their power to gift it to a select few. In doing so they would weaken themselves, but it was what was required. And so, the Aspects called upon the most faithful, wise, and powerful of the first races and ascended them to godhood. These lesser pantheons of gods took to the battlefield against the Archdevils and Demonlords pushing them back into the Nine Hells and the Abyss. The Aspects themselves took the fight to the Fatali's lair where they sealed Fatalis away, preventing it from ever physically leaving its lair for eternity, but at the cost of the first Aspect Io's life.": "Aspect没有能力给予所有第一种族不朽，他们知道这一点，但他们有能力将它赠送给少数人。这样做，他们会削弱自己，但这是必须的。于是，诸神召唤了第一种族中最忠诚、最聪明、最强大的人，并将他们提升为神。这些较小的众神殿在战场上与大恶魔和魔王作战，将他们推回九层地狱和深渊。方面军自己把战斗带到了法塔利的巢穴，他们把法塔利封印起来，防止它永远离开巢穴，但代价是第一个方面军艾欧的生命。",
	"In the small village of Cathar, old folktales are told of Heaven's Mounts creation during the War of the Ancients. It has been said that the peak of Heaven's mount is a gateway to the Upper Planes and was guarded by a number of elder dragons known as dalamadur. When the Archdevils attacked the Upper Planes, they used the gate atop the mountain to invade, but not before the dalamadurs massacred much ofthe Devil's army. Now the mountains have markings all overthem, showing where each of these elder dragons dug. In the present, chunks of the mountains are falling to the ground and the formations don't look natural in the slightest. It is said that these giant elder dragons went underground under the mountain and still guard the gate to this day.": "在凯撒的小村庄里，古老的民间故事讲述了天堂山在古人的战争中的创造。据说天堂山的山顶是通往上层世界的大门，由一些被称为达拉马杜尔的长老龙守护着。当大恶魔进攻上层世界时，他们利用山顶的大门进行入侵，但在dalamadur屠杀了恶魔的大部分军队之前。现在，山体上到处都有标记，显示出这些长老龙的挖掘地点。现在，大块大块的山峰倒在地上，这些构造看起来丝毫不自然。据说这些巨大的长老龙进入了山下的地下，直到今天还在守卫着山门。",
	"In the War of the Ancients, a brawl took place in the Great Forest. This fight was between an espinas and an unknown elder dragon, believed to be the first of many created by the Fatalis.": "在古人的战争中，大森林里发生了一场争吵。这场争斗是在一只艾斯宾娜和一只不知名的长老龙之间进行的，据说这是法塔利斯创造的众多龙中的第一只。",
	"Espinas was the ruler and protected its home with all of its might, even going as far as taking on the elder dragon solo to stay. Through determination and power, espinas was able to defeat the elder dragon and claim its title as Lord of the Great Forest. This made espinas one of the few monsters equal to an elder dragon during this age, but there is no known sighting of espinas in recent years.": "埃斯皮纳斯是统治者，全力保护它的家园，甚至不惜与长老龙单挑，也要留下来。通过决心和力量，埃斯皮纳斯能够击败长老龙，并称其为大森林之主。这使espinas成为这个时代为数不多的与长老龙相当的怪物之一，但近年来没有人知道espinas的踪迹。",
	"In Ancient times, the desert region of the Old World was covered by a great sea filled with the ancestors of some monsters seen today. The Jhen Mohran's ancestors ruled the region and defended it with the tritons against the Demon Lord Dagon and its army during the War of the Ancients. These sea battles did untold damage not only to the sea itself, but it remained in a constant stalemate between the two forces until the end of the war. Whenever one side would win a battle, the other would counter attack somewhere else, canceling out the territory each gain. It wasn't until the lesser gods entered the battle that Dagon was forced back to the abyss, but not before he opened a portal to the Shadowsea that would consume the entirety of the region's water before vanishing. For centuries after the war, the region remained an inhospitable barren waste of sea creature bones and decayed vegetation until the Sand God, Odibatorasu transformed the region into the deserts found in the present.": "在远古时代，旧世界的沙漠地区被一个巨大的海洋所覆盖，其中充满了今天所看到的一些怪物的祖先。詹莫兰的祖先统治着这个地区，并在古人战争期间用三叉戟抵御魔王达贡及其军队。这些海战不仅对海洋本身造成了难以言喻的损害，而且直到战争结束，两支部队之间仍处于持续的僵持状态。每当一方赢得一场战斗，另一方就会反攻其他地方，抵消各自获得的领土。直到小神们加入战斗，达贡才被迫回到深渊，但在此之前，他打开了一个通往影海的入口，在消失之前消耗了该地区全部的水。在战后的几个世纪里，该地区仍然是一片荒凉的不毛之地，到处是海洋生物的骨头和腐烂的植被，直到沙神奥迪巴托拉苏将该地区改造成现在的沙漠。",
	"The war finally came to a close when Fatalis and its generals were finally pushed back to their respective planes. The second Aspect, Pelor, filled the void that the First Aspect left behind, becoming the leader of the other Aspects and gods.The lesser gods, or guardians as they came to be known as, said their goodbyes to the first races and joined the remaining Aspects in the Upper Planes.

	"Though the Fatalis was sealed, the corruption of the Five's creation still seeped into the Lower Plane, forming new devils, creatures, and other abominations. It was only a matter of time before the corruption once again leaked intothe Material Plane.

	"Unlike the original five Aspects, the Guardians did not agree on how exactly to go about protecting the world and split into smaller pantheons that reported to one of the Aspects. They were known as: The Platinum Court, The Wild Lords, and the Radiant Eye. Some believed the creation of new monsters and expansion of nature was the best solution, and so they went to the Beastlands to begin their work. Others believed that the first races were the answer. After all the Aspects choose them to become gods. So they shared their power and knowledge with those deserving and created what is now known as the ancient civilization. Finally a select few, thought to contain the corruption, preventing its spread. In doing so, the world would remain in harmony forever, or so they thought.": "与最初的五个方面不同，守护者们并没有就如何保护世界达成一致意见，而是分裂成更小的万神殿，向其中一个方面汇报。他们被称为。铂金法庭、野蛮人领主和辐射之眼。一些人认为创造新的怪物和扩大自然界是最好的解决办法，因此他们前往野兽地带开始他们的工作。其他人则认为第一批种族就是答案。毕竟本体选择他们成为神。因此，他们与那些有资格的人分享他们的力量和知识，并创造了现在被称为古代文明的东西。最后，少数人被认为可以遏制腐败，防止其蔓延。这样一来，世界将永远保持和谐，或者说他们是这样认为的。",
	"When the Guardians formed the Platinum Court they presented themselves to the new leaders of the first races at the request of the third Aspect Bahamut. The pantheon nurtured the first races, expanding their knowledge and power beyond their wildest dreams. Thousands of years passed and the ancestors of the first races came to be known as the ancient civilization. In time they used their newfound knowledge and the materials they collected from the monster corpses during the War of the Ancients to build giant towers that reached to the heavens, cities of stone within the mountains, elegant towns in the forests, and settlements of all different types across the world. They became a highly-advanced society with technology that the races of today still can't figure out.": "当守护者们组成白金法庭时，他们应第三位Aspect Bahamut的要求，向第一种族的新领导人介绍了自己。万神殿培育了第一种族，扩大了他们的知识和力量，超出了他们最疯狂的梦想。几千年过去了，第一种族的祖先们被称为古代文明。随着时间的推移，他们利用新发现的知识和在古人战争期间从怪物尸体上收集的材料，建造了直达天际的巨塔、山中的石头城市、森林中的优雅城镇，以及世界各地的各种不同类型的定居点。他们成为一个高度先进的社会，拥有今天的种族仍然无法理解的技术。",
	"The Wild Lords under the leadership of the Fifth Aspect Eldath, spent their time repairing the world and creating monsters to inhabit it. They started with the creation of three monsters; the akantor, odibatorasu, and ukanlos. To the races of the present day they are known respectively as the black, white, and sand gods. The odibatorasu created the deserts from the now empty sea, while the ukanlos and akantor repaired the damage from the demons within the Northern El De regions. They filled the world with warrior monsters to defend the land. These formidable beasts could mold the world around them and bend the elements to their will.": "荒野领主在第五位Aspect Eldath的领导下，花时间修复世界并创造怪物来居住。他们首先创造了三种怪物：阿坎托尔、奥迪巴托拉苏和尤坎洛斯。对于今天的种族来说，他们分别被称为黑神、白神和沙神。奥迪巴托拉苏（odibatorasu）从现在空荡荡的大海中创造了沙漠，而尤坎洛斯（ukanlos）和阿坎托尔（akantor）则修复了北艾尔德地区的恶魔造成的破坏。他们让世界充满了捍卫土地的战士型怪物。这些强大的野兽可以塑造他们周围的世界，并使各种元素屈从于他们的意志。",
	"Before the world could return to what it once was, the Radiant Eye under the command of the Fourth Aspect, Tiamat, set out to rid the material plane of the corruption that remained after the War of the Ancients. They enlisted the members of the ancient civilization and monsters alike to hunt down the rabid beasts, and sanctify the lands across the world. Using the technology of the ancient civilization and with the assistance of the Platinum Court they crafted weapons and armor to combat the new monsters born from the corruption. They used the powers granted to them by the gods, blessing the land, and sending the corruption back to the Lower Plane, but in doing so they strengthened the demons, devils, and the Fatalis himself.": "在世界能够恢复到它曾经的样子之前，辐射之眼在第四面Tiamat的指挥下，开始清除物质界在古人之战后留下的腐败。他们招募了古代文明的成员和怪物来猎杀狂暴的野兽，并使世界各地的土地神圣化。他们利用古代文明的技术，并在白金法庭的协助下，制作了武器和盔甲，以对抗腐败中诞生的新怪物。他们使用诸神赋予他们的力量，祝福土地，并将腐败送回下层世界，但在这样做的过程中，他们加强了恶魔、魔鬼和法塔里斯本人。",
	"It all started with the Great Wheel. Tiamat along with the assistance of the Radiant Eyes attempted to patch the holes in the Great Wheel where the corruption emanated from. If successful, the corruption would grow no stronger, and the Lower Planes and Fatalis would no longer be able to use it to enter the material plane without first weakening themselves in the process. The patch for a time was a success, but it was applied at an unknown and devastating cost. The corruption had taken hold of Tiamat and as it grew within her, so did the Fatalis's influence.": "这一切都始于巨轮。提亚马特在辐射眼的协助下，试图修补大转轮上的漏洞，因为腐败是从那里发出的。如果成功的话，腐败将不再变得更强，下层世界和法塔利斯将不再能够利用它进入物质世界，而不会在这个过程中首先削弱自己。这个补丁在一段时间内是成功的，但它是以一个未知的、破坏性的代价来应用的。腐败已经控制了提亚马特，随着它在她体内的增长，Fatalis的影响也在增长。",
	"With Tiamat as its new vestige, the Fatalis set its plan in motion. Tiamat slowly spread the corruption through the Radiant Eyes and its followers, twisting and contorting them into the pantheon known as the Eyes of the Abyss. Soon the corrupt monsters roamed free, spreading Fatalis's influence to the Wild Lord's creations.": "有了提亚马特作为它的新继承人，法塔利斯开始实施它的计划。提亚马特通过辐射之眼和它的追随者慢慢地传播腐败，将它们扭曲成被称为深渊之眼的万神殿。很快，这些腐败的怪物就自由自在地游荡，将法塔利斯的影响传播到野性之主的创造物上。",
	"During this time, the ancient civilization had stalled. Reports of Tiamat's successful patching of the Great Wheel brought celebration to the ancients, but with their resources running dry from the War of the Ancients and with the now corrupt followers of the Radiant Eye no longer killing new monsters, the ancients grew desperate. After much discussion and a bit of influence by Fatalis, the decision was made to begin hunting the monsters throughout the world. Waiting for them to die was too slow and would only ever be enough for repairs.": "在这段时间里，古代文明已经停滞不前。关于提亚马特成功修补巨轮的报告给古人带来了庆祝，但随着他们的资源在古人战争中的枯竭，以及现在腐败的辐射之眼的追随者不再杀死新的怪物，古人越来越绝望。经过多次讨论和法塔里斯的影响，决定开始在全世界范围内猎杀怪物。等待他们死亡的过程太慢了，而且只够用来修理。",
	"At the same time the other gods began to take notice of the spreading corruption throughout the Five's world. The three confronted Tiamat who responded by opening a portal for the Archdevils and their army to enter the Upper Plane, sending the heavens into chaos. The Great Dragon War had begun.": "与此同时，其他诸神也开始注意到五神世界中不断蔓延的腐败。三人与提亚马特对峙，提亚马特的回应是为大恶魔和他们的军队打开了一个进入上层世界的门户，使天堂陷入混乱。大龙战争开始了。",
	"As the war raged in the heaven's above, the ancient civilization continued to advance on the material plane. Their advancement did not come without sacrifices as an innumerable amount of dragons were hunted, killed, and captured for the sake of research; to improve the quality of life for the ancients. Because of this, many of the species were left on the brink of extinction. This wanton destruction of the their kin angered the dragons. No longer would they sit idly by and let their kind be killed or be used as mere cattle. It was time to break away from the ancients who had forgotten the rules of nature, and destroy them.": "当战争在天上肆虐时，古代文明继续在物质层面上前进。他们的进步并不是没有牺牲，因为为了研究，无数的龙被猎杀和捕获；为了改善古人的生活质量。正因为如此，许多物种被留在了灭绝的边缘。这种对他们亲属的肆意破坏激怒了龙。他们再也不会坐视不管，任由自己的同类被杀或被当做牲口使用。现在是时候与那些忘记了自然规则的古人决裂了，并摧毁他们。",
	"Eventually the wars converged, Tiamat and the archdevils were pushed out of the Upper Planes into the Material Plane. In an attempt to weaken the Aspects army, Fatalis sent an aspect of itself to destroy the kingdom of Schrade. The material plane became the battle field for all sides. The monsters of the world had been fully consumed by the corruption and joined the demons and devils in the war. This began a long, violent war between the ancients, dragons, devils, and demons that spread worldwide, leaving behind mass destruction just about everywhere.": "最终，战争交织在一起，提亚马特和大恶魔被赶出上层世界，进入物质世界。为了削弱Aspects的军队，Fatalis派自己的一个方面去摧毁Schrade王国。物质界成为各方的战场。世界上的怪物们已经完全被腐败所吞噬，并加入了恶魔和魔鬼的战争中。这开始了古人、龙、魔鬼和恶魔之间漫长而激烈的战争，这场战争蔓延到全世界，几乎在所有地方都留下了大规模的破坏。",
	"At the end of the war, the ancient civilization and almost every creature in the world was wiped out. Tiamat was banished to the Nine Hells, along with the Archdevils. Those within her pantheon were scattered across the Planes of Limbo and Pandemonium, a punishment for their treason. The Aspect of Fatalis was sealed away in the ruins of Castle Schrade and the Platinum Court with the Wild Lords returned to the Upper Planes victorious in the war at the cost of everything.": "在战争结束时，古代文明和世界上几乎所有的生物都被消灭了。提亚马特和大恶魔一起被放逐到九层地狱。她的神殿中的那些人被分散到Limbo和Pandemonium星球上，这是对他们叛国的惩罚。法塔利斯之神被封印在施拉德城堡的废墟中，白金法庭和野生领主以一切代价在战争中取得了胜利，回到了上层世界。",
	"Centuries passed before the gods regained their power, and many were devastated by the destruction of their creations. Some gods were so filled with despair and grief they wished to leave and start anew. Others wished to stay and rebuild. After much debate and input from the remaining three Aspects, the gods looked to rebuild. There was just one complication.": "几个世纪过去了，众神才重新获得了他们的力量，许多人被他们的创造物的毁灭所摧毁了。一些神被绝望和悲痛所充满，他们希望离开并重新开始。其他人则希望留下来重建。经过大量的辩论和其余三个方面的意见，众神寻求重建。只是有一个复杂的问题。",
	"When the Great Wheel was patched by Tiamat, the corruption had only one place to go, into the life of the new creations. The corruption and fatalis's influence would always remain within anything the gods created and they no longer had the power to change or create a new system. So they did only what they could, they poured their own divine influence into the wheel. Their creations from this point forward would be capable of both good and evil, and the war with Fatalis would continue through their creations, but so long as they guided them towards the light, the balance would remain.": "当大轮盘被提亚马特修补后，腐败只有一个地方可以去，就是进入新造物的生命。腐败和法塔利斯的影响将永远留在诸神创造的任何东西中，他们不再有能力改变或创造一个新的系统。所以他们只做了他们能做的，他们把自己的神性影响注入轮子。他们的创造物从这一点上看既能行善也能作恶，与法塔利斯的战争将通过他们的创造物继续进行，但只要他们引导它们走向光明，平衡就会保持下去。",
	"The Wild Lords filled the world with new creatures, big and small, but none as powerful as the warrior monsters that existed before. They adapted nature to work with the corruption and keep it in balance with the help of the wyverians, who became the first druids and rangers.": "野生领主让世界充满了新的生物，有大有小，但都不如之前存在的战士怪物强大。他们对自然进行了改造，使之与腐败现象相适应，并在维维利亚人的帮助下保持平衡，他们成为第一批德鲁伊和游侠。",
	"The Platinum Court created the races once more. Using religion and worship, the Platinum Court guided the masses indirectly towards the light. They shared their power with those they deemed worthy and limited the knowledge they gave, letting the races advance their technology slowly through the information found in the ruined settlements of the ancient civilization.": "白金法庭再次创造了种族。利用宗教和崇拜，白金法庭间接地引导大众走向光明。他们与那些他们认为有价值的人分享他们的力量，并限制他们提供的知识，让种族通过在古代文明的废墟定居点中发现的信息来慢慢推进他们的技术。",
	"Hundreds of years after the rebuilding of the world, some wyverians began to hunt down monsters at the request of the Wild Lords. This was the beginning of the hunting career. These wyverians were known to wander the world in search of creatures that fell to the Fatalis's corruption but also to be one with nature itself, due to having a great compassion for it and its many life forms. Besides hunting, some wyverians became merchants and began to take requests from people to do certain things, such as gathering mushrooms or mining for rare ore. The main reason why the wyverians started hunting is because the other races were defenseless against the harsh monsters that haunted many areas, due to the Platinum's Court decision to limit the knowledge they passed down. This led to wyverians protecting the other races against said monsters due to the will of the Wild Lords and taking pity on the other races. Some of the other races saw this act and followed in the footsteps of the wyverians. This eventually led to the Hunter's Guild forming some time later.": "在世界重建的数百年后，一些wyverians开始应野生领主的要求猎杀怪物。这就是狩猎生涯的开始。这些wyverians被称为在世界范围内徘徊，寻找那些落入Fatalis腐败的生物，但也由于对自然和它的许多生命形式有极大的同情心，而与自然本身融为一体。除了狩猎，一些wyverians成为商人，开始接受人们的请求，做一些事情，如收集蘑菇或开采稀有矿石。wyverians开始狩猎的主要原因是，由于白金法庭决定限制他们传授的知识，其他种族对困扰许多地区的严酷怪物毫无抵抗力。这导致wyverians在野生领主的意志下保护其他种族对抗上述怪物，并对其他种族表示同情。一些其他种族看到了这一行为，并追随了wyverians的脚步。这最终导致了猎人公会在一段时间后的形成。",
	"The Hunter's Guild was formed when the other races saw what the wyverians were doing in order to help preserve all species and to harmonize all races with nature. This led to the corporation growing overtime and becoming well-known among the world for its hunters and hunting restrictions. Other corporations soon formed, such as the {@i Royal Paleontology Scriveners} and {@i Elder Dragon Observation Team}.": "当其他种族看到wyverians所做的事情时，猎人公会就成立了，以帮助保护所有物种，并使所有种族与自然和谐相处。这使得该公司加班加点地发展，并因其猎人和狩猎限制在世界范围内闻名。其他公司很快就形成了，如（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"Generations passed since the founding of the Hunter's guild. In this time, new rules were founded in the hunters guild and technology continued to progress as hunters and other explorers searched the ruins of the ancient civilization that were dotted across the world. But those are stories for another time.": "猎人公会成立后，几代人过去了。在这段时间里，猎人公会建立了新的规则，随着猎人和其他探险家对遍布世界的古代文明遗迹的搜寻，技术不断进步。但这些都是另一个时代的故事了。",
	"The gods found within these pages are not set in stone and you should feel free to add or remove them as you see fit.

Once their work was done, the Five left aspects of themselves to watch over their creation before leaving the Universe. The Five were never named, and only ever referenced by their number.": "五人组是世界和上层世界的创造者。他们用生物填充宇宙，用他们的力量祝福了许多第一批人类，创造了第一批种族。一旦他们的工作完成，五人组就会在离开宇宙之前留下自己的一部分来看护他们的创造。五人组从未被命名，只用他们的数字来指代。",

	"The Archdevils and Demon Lords were born from corruption when the Abyss and Nine Hells were formed. Being born in this way, these god-like beings have no innate allegiance to Fatalis, but they're willing to work with it and its followers if it proves to work in their favor. The standard 5e Demon Lords and Archdevils are all found within this setting.": "大恶魔和恶魔领主是在深渊和九层地狱形成时从腐败中诞生的。由于是以这种方式诞生的，这些神一样的存在并没有天生效忠于法塔里斯，但他们愿意与法塔里斯及其追随者合作，如果这被证明对他们有利。标准的5e恶魔领主和大恶魔都可以在这个设定中找到。",
	"Since the reemergence after the Great Dragon War a thousand years ago, the races of the world crawled back from extinction.

	"In the time of the ancient civilization the dragonborn were known far and wide, as the most devout and honorable race of the time. The original dragonborn were known to be humans who had ascended, by the grace of Io, to a state of body and mind that closely resembled the original image of the Five. These dragonborn excelled at all they did, becoming great heroes, community leaders, head of clergies and other research institutions of the ancient civilization.": "在古老的文明时代，龙裔是远近闻名的，是当时最虔诚、最尊贵的种族。众所周知，最初的龙裔是在艾欧的恩惠下升华到与五人的原始形象非常相似的身体和心灵状态的人类。这些龙裔在他们所做的一切中表现出色，成为伟大的英雄、社区领袖、神职人员和古代文明的其他研究机构的负责人。",
	"By the end of the Great Dragon War, most of the dragonborn had been wiped out with many of the elder dragonborn bloodlines going extinct with their elder dragon brethren. After the reemergence dragonborns were a rare sight for villages and even some towns. Those that lived in cities were typically well respected noble families that could trace their heritage back to the ancient civilization. New dragonborns that weren't born from these families were almost unheard of. It was a rare occasion when a person of any race proved themselves worthy to an Aspect, and were granted the gift as a reward. In Tiamat's case, she lorded the ascension over her followers, only granting the gift to those who bring her priceless artifacts, great wealth, or progress her plans beyond her expectations. Those who fail her, or request the ascension, instead are typically turned into kobolds.": "在大龙战争结束时，大部分龙族被消灭了，许多长老龙族的血统与他们的长老龙族一起灭绝了。重新出现后，龙裔在村庄甚至是一些城镇都是罕见的。那些住在城市里的人通常是受人尊敬的贵族家庭，他们的遗产可以追溯到古老的文明中。不是从这些家庭出生的新龙裔几乎闻所未闻。当任何种族的人证明自己配得上 \"展望\"，并被授予天赋作为奖励时，这是一个罕见的情况。在提亚马特的例子中，她对她的追随者进行统治，只把礼物授予那些给她带来无价的文物、巨大的财富，或者使她的计划取得超出她预期的进展的人。那些辜负她的人，或者要求升天的人，通常会被变成哥布林。",
	"Dragonborn of any age have a well-known dedication to honor, but how deeply rooted this trait is remains debatable. However, all dragonborn tended to view all living things, even hated enemies, as deserving of courtesy and respect. To dragonborn, honor was more than a word and was often considered more important than life itself. Cowardice was not simply undesirable among dragonborn, it was considered outright repulsive.": "任何时代的龙裔都有众所周知的对荣誉的奉献精神，但这种特质的根基有多深仍有待商榷。然而，所有的龙裔都倾向于将所有的生物，甚至是憎恨的敌人，视为值得礼遇和尊重的。对龙族来说，荣誉不仅仅是一个词，而且往往被认为比生命本身更重要。懦弱在龙族中不仅仅是不受欢迎，它被认为是彻头彻尾的厌恶。",
	"Part of the roots of this honorable attitude lay in the dragonborn's drive for self-improvement. The draconic nature of dragonborn gave them a strong self-consciousness and a tendency for strong emotions. Both of these combined to make dragonborn particularly wanting for the approval of others. Dragonborn placed great value on the skill of an individual, including themselves. Failing at a task was anathema to dragonborn and as a result they could sometimes push themselves to unhealthy extremes of effort. This aspect of the dragonborn mind meant few of the race took a laid-back approach to any skill or ability, striving always to become the masters of a particular skill, and dragonborn respected those among other races who approached life in the same manner. As a result, most dragonborn adventurers came to their way of life through a desire to prove themselves and win respect from their brethren.": "这种可敬的态度的部分根源在于龙裔自我完善的动力。龙族的龙性使他们具有强烈的自我意识和强烈的情感倾向。这两点结合起来，使龙族特别希望得到别人的认可。龙族对个人的技能非常重视，包括他们自己。在一项任务中失败是龙裔的耻辱，因此他们有时会把自己推到不健康的极端努力中。龙族的这种思想意味着很少有人对任何技能或能力采取轻松的态度，他们总是努力成为某项技能的主人，龙族尊重其他种族中那些以同样方式对待生活的人。因此，大多数龙裔冒险者都是通过渴望证明自己并赢得兄弟们的尊重而走上他们的生活道路的。",
	"The bold and hardy dwarves of the Old World are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Modeled by the All-Father after the reemergence almost every dwarf in the Old World originates from Harth, a village near the Everwoods (located west of the Old World). Harth itself still stands as the central heart of dwarven society, but in the last few hundred years they have welcomed the troverians into their home. Combining their crafts, the troverians and dwarves have made a dramatic impact on a hunter's quality of life. Mountain and hill dwarves alike can be found in the many cities and locales of the Old World, but typically in small numbers. Hill dwarves are known to make above ground settlements of their own. If drawn to more dangerous pursuits, many dwarves turn to mercenary work, working with the hunters guild and wycademy in search of ancient civilization artifacts.": "旧世界大胆而坚韧的矮人以熟练的战士、矿工以及石头和金属的工人而闻名。在全能之父的示范下，旧世界的每个矮人几乎都来自哈斯，一个靠近常林的村庄（位于旧世界的西部）。哈斯本身仍然是矮人社会的核心，但在过去的几百年里，他们欢迎特罗维利亚人进入他们的家园。结合他们的手艺，特罗维拉人和矮人对猎人的生活质量产生了巨大的影响。在旧世界的许多城市和地方都可以找到山地和丘陵矮人，但通常数量不多。众所周知，山地矮人会在地面上建立自己的定居点。如果被更危险的追求所吸引，许多矮人转而从事雇佣兵工作，与猎人公会和巫师学院合作，寻找古代文明的文物。",
	"The dwarves that stray away from their heritage and gave into the corruption in their heart became the first duergar. As generations passed, the duergar carved out an existence in the Underdark, near the volcanoes in the northern el de region. Their kinship to other dwarven subraces could be compared to that of the drow to surface elves.": "那些偏离了他们的传统并向他们心中的堕落屈服的矮人成为了第一批duergar。随着时间的推移，duergar在暗黑世界的北部el de地区的火山附近开辟了一个生存空间。他们与其他矮人亚族的亲缘关系可以比作鸦人与地表精灵的关系。",
	"Duergar are a dark and cruel race, who show no mercy to their foes and who take great pleasure in inflicting pain on others. They are pessimistic of their future and deeply cynical regarding the motives of others. Because of their pessimism, duergar rarely adventured of their own free will and were instead most commonly exiles cast out of their society. These adventurers, most commonly concerned with personal gratification, were commonly outlanders, gladiators, criminals, or urchins.": "杜尔加是一个黑暗而残酷的种族，他们对敌人毫不留情，并以给别人带来痛苦为乐。他们对自己的未来持悲观态度，对他人的动机抱有深深的嘲讽。由于他们的悲观主义，杜尔加人很少按照自己的意愿进行冒险，而是最常见的被社会抛弃的流亡者。这些冒险家最关心的是个人满足，他们通常是外乡人、角斗士、罪犯或顽童。",
	"Hill dwarves are stout, tough individuals like their mountain brethren but are less off-putting and gruff in nature. They are a deeply materialistic race who believe that the resources of the natural world exist only to serve the purpose of conscious beings. To a hill dwarf, there is no greater purpose than to fashion the minerals of the earth into things of beauty.": "山地矮人和他们的山地兄弟一样，都是粗壮、坚韧的人，但在本质上没有那么令人讨厌和粗暴。他们是一个极度物质主义的种族，相信自然界的资源只是为了服务于有意识的人类而存在。对山地矮人来说，没有比把地球上的矿物塑造成美丽的东西更重要的目的了。",
	"Hill dwarves were once mountain dwarves that were exiled from their homes or had their home destroyed and moved above ground instead of deeper like their duergar cousins. As generations passed, these dwarves settled above ground, forsaking the old ways and in exchange found new friends, new business opportunities, spiritual enlightenment, and even arcane knowledge.": "山地矮人曾经是山地矮人，他们被放逐出自己的家园，或者家园被毁，于是搬到了地面上，而不是像他们的杜尔加表兄弟那样深入地下。随着时间的推移，这些矮人在地面上定居下来，放弃了旧的方式，作为交换，他们找到了新的朋友、新的商业机会、精神启蒙，甚至是神秘的知识。",
	"Whether or not the mountain dwarves claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves are polite, particularly to elders, and possess a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves value their traditions and look for inspiration from the ancient civilization. Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism.": "无论山地矮人声称他们是由世界的石头雕刻而成的说法是否属实，矮人都有许多被认为与他们生活的石头相似的品质。坚强、坚韧、可靠，矮人很有礼貌，尤其是对长者，拥有超越许多其他种族的智慧。矮人重视他们的传统，并从古代文明中寻找灵感。矮人也以其顽固的天性和愤世嫉俗而闻名。",
	"A mountain dwarves friendship and trust is hard to earn, but was ironclad once won. For dwarves, loyalty is more than a word and they feel that it should be both valued and rewarded. Naturally suspicious, the mountain dwarves are slow to trust others and rightfully so. Many of their attempts at expanding their territory proved disastrous due to trusting other races. They do not forgive these past mistakes easily and the entire race has more or less declared war on goblins and orcs as a whole, wiping them out where they find them.": "山地矮人的友谊和信任是很难赢得的，但一旦赢得，就是铁板一块。对矮人来说，忠诚不仅仅是一句话，他们觉得忠诚应该得到重视和回报。山地矮人天生多疑，对他人的信任很慢，这也是理所当然的。由于信任其他种族，他们在扩大领土方面的许多尝试被证明是灾难性的。他们不会轻易原谅这些过去的错误，整个种族或多或少地对地精和兽人整体宣战，在他们发现的地方将他们消灭掉。",
	"The elves were one of the first races created after the creation of the Old World. They were the first race to be created by Eldath meant to represent the beauty of nature. The elves originated in the wooded lands of the Verdant Hills, and many elves still call the forest their home. After the War of the Ancients, when the elves allied themselves with Eldath against Fatalis and its demonic horde, many of the high elf families did not return to the forest, instead choosing a new life in the city of Riveru. Even after the reemergence, Riveru was a wonderous thing of beauty. Many elven heroes and hunters originate from this city.": "精灵是旧世界创建后的第一批种族之一。他们是由艾尔达斯创造的第一个种族，旨在代表自然之美。精灵们起源于翠绿山丘的林地，许多精灵仍然把森林当作他们的家。古代战争之后，当精灵们与艾尔达斯结盟对抗法塔里斯及其恶魔部落时，许多高等精灵家族并没有返回森林，而是选择在里维鲁城过上新的生活。即使在重新崛起之后，里维鲁也是一个神奇的东西。许多精灵英雄和猎人都源自这座城市。",
	"The high elves, named for their close resemblance to Eldath and innate magic ability, call the city of Riveru home. Within the city, the elves focus their studies and talents on the protection of the city.

	"The high elves are in good standing with their wood elf kin, and with the other races of the world. They have a deep seeded hatred for the Dark Mother and the drow that follow her. Seeking to disrupt her plans over anything else, besides the protection of their city.": "高等精灵与他们的木精灵亲属，以及世界上的其他种族都有良好的关系。他们对黑暗之母和追随她的乌鸦有着根深蒂固的憎恨。除了保护他们的城市之外，他们寻求破坏她的计划，而不是其他任何东西。",
	"Since ancient times, the wood elves have fought to protect their homeland. After the founding of the Hunters Guild and the Elder Dragon Observation team, young wood elves found that their wanderlust and skills in hunting and survival were a perfect fit for these organizations. Over the passage of time, the wood elf clans spread far and wide, preferring to take up residence in the small villages or outposts near or in the forests of the world. They viewed themselves as guardians of these forests. They were allies and teachers rather than rivals to those in their communities. As a people, wood elves are largely seen as calm and level-headed.": "自古以来，木精灵就为保护自己的家园而战。猎人公会和长老龙观察队成立后，年轻的木精灵发现他们的流浪精神和狩猎及生存技能非常适合这些组织。随着时间的推移，木精灵部族传播得越来越广，他们更愿意在世界森林附近或森林中的小村庄或前哨站居住。他们认为自己是这些森林的守护者。他们是盟友和老师，而不是他们社区中那些人的对手。作为一个民族，木精灵在很大程度上被认为是冷静和平和的。",
	"Many hours of a typical wood elf's life are spent on the hunt, which was both a practical activity and a pleasurable one. Most of the time that wood elves were not hunting they were enjoying themselves at ease within the highest branches of their forest homes.": "一个典型的木精灵生活中的许多时间是在狩猎中度过的，这既是一项实用的活动，也是一项愉悦的活动。在木精灵不打猎的大部分时间里，他们都在森林家园的最高枝头内自得其乐。",
	"Few elves let alone other races wish to be associated with their subterranean kin. The drow were once high elves that worshiped the goddess Sune. When the goddess was corrupted she used her alluring whispers to convince her followers to ally with Fatalis in the Great Dragon War. After the Dark Mothers banishment to the Lower Planes, her high elf followers went into exile, hiding below the earth. As generations went by, the high elves blonde hair turned a silvery white, eyes blood red, and their once beautiful skin turned the color of ash. They took on a new name, no longer the high elves, but the drow servants of Lolth.": "很少有精灵，更不用说其他种族希望与他们的地下亲属有联系。乌鸦曾经是崇拜苏妮女神的高等精灵。当女神被腐蚀后，她用她诱人的低语说服她的追随者在大龙战争中与法塔里斯结盟。在黑暗之母被放逐到下层世界后，她的高等精灵追随者们开始流亡，躲在地底。随着时间的推移，高等精灵的金发变成了银白色，眼睛变成了血红色，他们曾经美丽的皮肤变成了灰烬的颜色。他们有了一个新的名字，不再是高等精灵，而是洛尔思的乌鸦仆人。",
	"Drow, by reputation, were almost entirely evil. The drow society nominally had two purposes, called \"the First and Second Part of the Destiny of the People\". The former was about forcing all other races of the Underdark into subservience, while the latter was about driving the entire elven population into extinction. To achieve this Lolth promoted perpetual infighting and violent competition, so that the constant training would make them stronger and smarter. However, the extreme, self-destructive degree to which this was taken prevented the drow from achieving either of their purposes, barring possibilities for significant growth. In fact, despite her rhetoric, Lolth merely enjoyed the infighting that she promoted and put no effort into reaching the supposed goals.": "乌鸦，从名声上看，几乎完全是邪恶的。乌鸦社会名义上有两个目的，称为 \"人民命运的第一和第二部分\"。前者是为了迫使暗黑世界的所有其他种族臣服，而后者则是为了将整个精灵人口赶尽杀绝。为了达到这个目的，洛尔思提倡永久的内讧和暴力竞争，这样不断的训练会使他们变得更强大和更聪明。然而，这种极端的、自我毁灭的程度使鸦人无法实现他们的任何一个目的，阻碍了显著增长的可能性。事实上，尽管她说得头头是道，但洛尔思只是享受她所提倡的内讧，并没有为达到所谓的目标而付出努力。",
	"Drow rarely come to the surface, for most are too proud to return defeated to the sun-drenched lands of the Green Goddess, even to escape the madness of the underworld. Nevertheless, some still choose this dishonorable path. Those that travel to Riveru seeking redemption are executed before they enter the gates. The drow that return to their original homeland are welcomed by the wood elves, but only after renouncing Lolth and embracing Eldath once again. Others seek to join the Hunters Guild, as a way of atoning for their races' past sins by slaying the corruption that seeps into other creatures, like it did to their ancestors.": "鸦人很少来到地表，因为大多数人都太骄傲了，不愿意将被打败的人送回绿色女神的阳光普照的土地，即使是为了逃离疯狂的冥界。然而，有些人仍然选择了这条不光彩的道路。那些前往里维鲁寻求救赎的人在进入大门之前就被处决了。回到故乡的鸦人受到木精灵的欢迎，但只有在放弃洛尔兹并再次拥抱艾尔达斯之后。其他人则寻求加入猎人公会，通过杀死渗入其他生物体内的腐败，就像他们的祖先一样，来为他们的种族过去的罪孽赎罪。",
	"For a human, having a half-elf child was a blessing that brought their family closer to the gods. They grew up adored in their communities, growing up with acceptance and praise. It is uncommon for a half-elf to leave their families or communities when they come of age. Most of them take over family businesses or find a respectable job in town. Those that do feel the wanderlust from their elven heritage, usually join the Hunters Guild or Wycademy as a way to satiate that need.": "对于人类来说，拥有一个半精灵的孩子是一种祝福，使他们的家庭更接近神灵。他们在社区中受到崇拜，在接受和赞美中成长。半精灵成年后离开他们的家庭或社区是不常见的。他们中的大多数人都会接管家族企业或在镇上找到一份受人尊敬的工作。那些从他们的精灵血统中感受到流浪欲望的人，通常会加入猎人公会或Wycademy，作为满足这种需求的一种方式。",
	"For the elves, their opinions varied. The wood elves welcome the half-elves with arms wide open, sharing their traditions and knowledge. The high elves of Riveru are not so accepting, the half-elves in their eyes are tainted. Their innate magic and ancestry are weakened by the human blood flowing within them, but that isn't to say that the half-elves have their uses. half-elves in Riveru work as house servants and doing other menial tasks in the town.": "对于精灵们来说，他们的意见各不相同。木精灵们张开双臂欢迎半精灵，分享他们的传统和知识。里维鲁的高等精灵则不那么接受，在他们眼中，半精灵是有污点的。他们与生俱来的魔法和血统被流淌在他们体内的人类血液所削弱，但这并不是说半身人有他们的用处。半身人在里弗鲁做家仆，在镇上做其他琐碎的工作。",
	"It is a tough life, that many half-elves choose to leave once they come of age, never to return to the city. Finally, the drow do not breed with weaker races, as such no drow half-elves are known to exist, but should one ever come to be, it would only find death by both the high elves and drow, but it might find sanctuary with the wood elves.": "这是一种艰难的生活，许多半精灵一旦成年就会选择离开，再也不回城市了。最后，乌鸦不与弱小的种族交配，因此没有已知的乌鸦半精灵存在，但如果有的话，它只会被高等精灵和乌鸦杀死，但它可能会在木精灵那里找到庇护所。",
	"The gnomes and gnomish culture were extremely prevalent during the time of the ancient civilization. There wasn't a village street or a city block where the sound of gears grinding, minor explosions, and yelps of surprise were mixed in with bursts of laughter and joy. The gnomes were responsible for many of the great innovations and inventions of the time. After the reemergence the ruins of the Tower to the far east and the Sky's Corridor on a remote island off the east coast of the great forest still stand as a testament to their work.": "在古代文明时期，地精和地精文化极为盛行。没有一条村街或一个城市街区的齿轮摩擦声、轻微的爆炸声和惊讶的叫声与阵阵笑声和欢乐声混在一起。地精们对当时许多伟大的创新和发明负有责任。重新出现后，远在东方的塔的废墟和大森林东海岸的一个偏远岛屿上的天空走廊仍然作为他们工作的证明而存在。",
	"The rock gnomes are more closely related to their ancestors than their cousins the forest gnomes. They have a natural curiosity towards technology and seek to find ways to better improve the lives of those in their communities. Their natural inventiveness leads them to become alchemists and tinkerers, seeking ways to use the resources around them in new ways.": "与他们的表亲森林地精相比，岩石地精与他们的祖先关系更为密切。他们对技术有天然的好奇心，并寻求方法来更好地改善他们社区中人的生活。他们天生的创造力使他们成为炼金术士和工匠，寻求以新的方式使用他们周围的资源。",

	"By the time they had returned to the Old World, generations had passed. The forest gnomes, as they were now called, had taken up residence in the Verdant Hills. Preferring to live in nature than in the bustling cities like their kin, the forest gnomes are more than happy to help their rock gnomish kin in their search to understand how nature works and how to manipulate it.": "当他们回到旧世界时，已经过去了几代人。森林地精，他们现在被称为森林地精，已经在绿野山庄居住了下来。比起像他们的亲戚一样生活在繁华的城市里，森林地精更愿意帮助他们的岩石地精亲戚去了解大自然的运作方式和如何操纵它。",
	"They tend to be good friends with good-spirited woodland folk, aiding them in their endeavors. Forest gnomes make great scouts for the Hunters Guild and Elder Dragon Observation Team due to their ability to befriend small woodland animals. Using these animals the forest gnomes are able to relay information about threats that might prowl their lands.": "他们往往与善良的林地居民成为好朋友，协助他们的工作。森林地精是猎人公会和长老龙观察小组的优秀侦察员，因为他们有能力与林地小动物交好。利用这些动物，森林地精能够传递有关可能在他们土地上徘徊的威胁的信息。",
	"One of the last races created by the gods before the Great Dragon War, the goliaths were outlanders who resided in the Snowy Mountains. Molded by Eldath from those who worshiped the ukanlos that resided deep in the mountain range, the goliaths are a race wrapped in tradition. Their society's key focus was competitiveness and held equality and fairness in high regard. They kept track of their accomplishments and saw everything as a challenge. Many outside of the race that didn't understand this tradition would find it quite annoying when a goliath would bring up how many times a certain thing would happen.": "哥利亚人是诸神在大龙战争前创造的最后一个种族之一，他们是居住在雪山上的外乡人。由艾尔达斯从那些崇拜居住在山脉深处的ukanlos的人中塑造出来的，歌利亚人是一个被传统所包裹的种族。他们社会的重点是竞争，并高度重视平等和公平。他们记录着自己的成就，并将一切视为挑战。许多不了解这种传统的种族外人会发现，当歌利亚人提起某件事情会发生多少次时，他们会感到相当恼火。",
	"This was not the case however. To goliaths, score-keeping was a natural and integral part of life, not meant to belittle or demean anyone.": "然而，情况并非如此。对高丽人来说，记分是生活中自然的、不可分割的一部分，并不是为了轻视或贬低任何人。",
	"Ancient goliaths lived in small tribes in the Snowy Mountains, that numbered between forty and sixty. This was usually made up of three to five extended families. Most goliaths lived in the same tribe their entire life. On rare occasions, a tribe that got too large would split into smaller tribes or smaller tribes would merge together.": "古代歌利亚人生活在雪山上的小部落里，人数在40到60之间。这通常是由三到五个大家庭组成的。大多数歌利亚人一生都生活在同一个部落里。在极少数情况下，一个太大的部落会分裂成更小的部落，或者小部落会合并在一起。",
	"These tribes only went to war as a final option, and for much of the Great Dragon War they were successful in this endeavor. It wasn't until the death of their beloved ukanlos by the hands of the Dark Mother's cultists that they allied with the Aspects. The war was bloody for the goliaths, many of the families and tribes were wiped out. Those that survived returned to the Snowy Mountains beaten and bruised, but with a new found respect for their allies.": "这些部落只把战争作为最后的选择，而在大龙战争的大部分时间里，他们在这方面是成功的。直到他们心爱的尤坎洛斯死于黑暗之母的邪教徒之手，他们才与方面军结盟。这场战争对歌利亚人来说是血腥的，许多家庭和部落被消灭了。那些幸存下来的人回到雪山后，虽然被打得遍体鳞伤，但对他们的盟友有了新的尊重。",
	"After the reemergence, the goliaths were an integral part of the Pokke Village's founding. The Snowy Mountains had always been their home, and their knowledge of the territory prevented many casualties in those initial years. Though most goliath tribes are nomadic, many of them chose to remain in Pokke Village as gladiators, soldiers, and hunters. In fact, after the founding of the Hunters Guild in Pokke Village, the goliaths were one of the first to join up. The guild to them, represented the tradition that was lost after ukanlos' death. They were able to compete not only with their fellow goliaths, but also all the other members of the guild. Rumors in the past have told of goliath hunters returning to the Snowy Mountain with large pure white eggs. Though they deny it, many believe the goliaths are searching for a ukanlos egg, in hopes of returning on to the mountains once again.": "重新崛起后，高丽人是博克村建立的一个组成部分。雪山一直是他们的家园，他们对领土的了解避免了最初那些年的许多伤亡。虽然大多数巨人部落是游牧民族，但他们中的许多人选择留在Pokke村作为角斗士、士兵和猎手。事实上，在Pokke村的猎人公会成立后，歌利亚人是第一批加入的人。这个公会对他们来说，代表了尤坎洛斯死后失去的传统。他们不仅能够与他们的同僚竞争，而且还能与公会的所有其他成员竞争。过去有传言说，歌利亚猎人带着大型纯白鸡蛋回到雪山。虽然他们否认，但许多人认为歌利亚人正在寻找尤坎洛斯的蛋，希望能再次回到山上去。",
	"Halfling clans have always been known for their curiosity and tendency to collect things.

	"When the War of the Ancients began, the halfling clans splintered. The lightfoot clan wished to avoid the war directly, instead focusing their attention on the curative and other beneficial properties the resources they gathered could provide their armies. The Stoutfoot were ready to fight, but while the adults headed to the front lines, their young took to defending the settlements as guards. The forgefoot clan as they came to be known during the war, strayed from plants and mushrooms. Instead they turned their focus on ways to bend the earth to the war's needs.": "当古人的战争开始时，半身人氏族分裂了。轻足部族希望直接避免战争，而是把注意力集中在他们收集的资源可以为他们的军队提供治疗和其他有益的属性上。Stoutfoot氏族已经做好了战斗的准备，但当成年人前往前线时，他们的年轻人则作为卫兵保卫着定居点。在战争期间，他们被称为 \"锻足氏族\"，他们远离了植物和蘑菇。相反，他们把重点放在如何使地球适应战争的需要上。",
	"After the war the halfling clans did not reunite. Two of the clans had found a new passion while the lightfoot clan stuck to the halfling traditions. The lightfoots resented the other clans for straying from the old ways which caused some minor conflicts between the clans throughout the time of the ancient civilization, but their accomplishments overshadowed these \"minor\" skirmishes.": "战后，半身人氏族并没有重新团结起来。其中两个部族找到了新的激情，而光脚氏族则坚持了半身人的传统。光脚族憎恨其他部族偏离了旧的方式，这在整个古代文明时期造成了部族之间的一些小冲突，但他们的成就掩盖了这些 \"小 \"冲突。",
	"After the reemergence the lightfoot clan has spread far and wide.

Tired of having a name similar to the traditionalist who are unwilling to change, the Stoutfoot clan came to be known as the Stoutguard clan. The Stoutguards are well known throughout the settlements of the Old World. Many do not take up hunting, instead choosing to guard the villages, cities, and towns they were born in. On a rare occasion, a Stoutguard has been known to enter the ranks of guild knight. Those who reach this achievement are treated as heroes and legends in their halfling communities.": "Stoutfoot氏族在重新崛起后取了一个新名字。由于厌倦了与那些不愿改变的传统主义者相似的名字，Stoutfoot氏族开始被称为Stoutguard氏族。坚固卫士在整个旧世界的定居点都很出名。许多人不从事狩猎，而是选择守卫他们所出生的村庄、城市和城镇。在极少数情况下，一个坚固卫士被称为进入了公会骑士的行列。那些达到这一成就的人在他们的半身人社区中被视为英雄和传奇人物。",
	"During the ancient times the human civilizations were widespread across the known world. They are diverse in skills and quick to adapt, which allowed them to learn and live with the other races without conflict. After the reemergence, the humans were recreated by the Aspect Pelor. With the Great Wheel infused with both divine and corruption, the Humans were made stronger, but their once good nature was now shaped by the world around them. Human hunters and folk heroes can originate from anywhere in the Old World and are typically found in all villages, cities, and towns. Most Commonly though, hunters that graduate from the hunter academy are from Minegarde or villages nearby in the Verdant Hills.": "在古代，人类文明广泛存在于整个已知世界。他们技能多样，适应能力强，这使他们能够在没有冲突的情况下与其他种族一起学习和生活。重新出现后，人类被Aspect Pelor重新创造。由于大轮回注入了神性和腐败，人类被变得更加强大，但他们曾经的善良本性现在被周围的世界所塑造。人类猎人和民间英雄可以来自旧世界的任何地方，通常在所有的村庄、城市和城镇都能找到。不过最常见的是，从猎人学院毕业的猎人都是来自米内加德或附近的维多山庄的村庄。",
	"Humans living in the Verdant hills provide the infrastructure for port and trade between the three largest cities; Dundorma, Verudo, and Riveru; and the rest of the world. As such, humans are typically skilled in some craft, business, or production. For the humans seeking a life away from civilization, more often than not find work with the wycademy or hunters guild as research explorers, archeologist, handlers, or hunters themselves.": "生活在维丹丘陵的人类为三个最大的城市--邓多马、维鲁多和里维鲁--与世界其他地区之间的港口和贸易提供基础设施。因此，人类通常精通一些工艺、商业或生产。对于寻求远离文明的生活的人类来说，更多的是在巫师学院或猎人公会找到工作，作为研究探索者、考古学家、搬运工或猎人本身。",
	"The Lynians are a relatively common race in the Old World, able to adapt to their environments much like humans. Although many of the lynian subspecies originated on the main continent in the Old World many of them have migrated to all corners of the world. For those who stay within multispecies communities, their short stature and beast-like nature has always proved a social hindrance in the lands of the tall folk. While lynians fight for respect within human communities, they can prove themselves through deeds, or humor, among their taller neighbors. They've been seen being farmers, traders, adventurers, etc. Some Lynians, known as \"palicos\", are known to assist hunters and quite a few are independent monster hunters, known as prowlers.": "莱尼人是旧世界中一个比较常见的种族，能够像人类一样适应环境。尽管许多莱尼人亚种起源于旧世界的主要大陆，但他们中的许多人已经迁移到世界的各个角落。对于那些呆在多物种社区的人来说，他们矮小的身材和野兽般的本性一直被证明是高大民族土地上的一个社会障碍。虽然莱尼人在人类社区中争取尊重，但他们可以通过行动或幽默来证明自己，在他们高大的邻居中。他们被认为是农民、商人、冒险家等等。一些被称为 \"Palicos \"的莱尼人被称为协助猎人，还有相当多的人是独立的怪物猎人，被称为游荡者。",
	"Cousins to the shakalaka, the boaboa are one of the few lynians that can tolerate the cold. They call the arctic regions of the world home and strangely enough worship the popo as a god. During the Great Dragon War, the boaboa allied with the Dark Mother when the goliaths and warforged came for the popo's fur and meat. At the Dark Mother's request, the boaboa were tasked with killing their enemies in the most torturous way possible. In return, the Dark Mother promised her protection of the popo. The boaboa excelled at their task, and it wasn't until her banishment that they realized her betrayal. The northern sea had been poisoned, filled with the corpses of the goliaths the boaboa had slain. It tainted everything, killing the popo and boaboa alike.": "波波亚是沙卡拉卡的表亲，是少数能忍受寒冷的莱尼人之一。他们以世界上的北极地区为家，奇怪的是，他们把波波作为神来崇拜。在大龙战争期间，当高丽人和战争锻造者为了波普的皮毛和肉而来时，波普与黑暗之母结盟。在黑暗之母的要求下，波波人的任务是以最折磨人的方式杀死他们的敌人。作为回报，黑暗之母承诺她会保护波波。Boaboa出色地完成了他们的任务，直到她被放逐，他们才意识到她的背叛。北部海域已经被毒化，充满了博阿婆所杀的巨人的尸体。它玷污了一切，杀死了波波和波波亚的人。",
	"After the reemergence, the boaboa worship the Wild Lords. It was by their grace that the popo returned to the world. They still have a great hate for the goliaths, just as the goliaths do for them. They're slow to trust, but once you earn it, the boaboa can prove to be an invaluable lifelong friend.": "重新出现后，波波人崇拜野人领主。正是在他们的恩惠下，波波族回到了这个世界。他们仍然对歌利亚人怀有极大的仇恨，就像歌利亚人对他们一样。他们对信任很迟钝，但一旦你赢得了信任，波波人就会被证明是一个无价的终生朋友。",
	"The felyne and melynx are the most common lynian subspecies found in the Old World. While both easily adapt to lifestyles with other races taking up jobs as chefs, blacksmith assistants, and other odd jobs, the melynx have a tendency to revert back to their more... wild nature. They are known to occasionally have items of value \"appear\" in their hands with no knowledge of how they got there. Of course they gladly return the items if asked, but any that go unclaimed are taken to their homes for safekeeping until their owner comes to retrieve them. For those felyne and melynx seeking greater respect, they typically join up with hunters as their palico or as prowlers themselves.": "Felyne和Melynx是在旧世界发现的最常见的lynian亚种。虽然两者都很容易适应其他种族的生活方式，从事厨师、铁匠助手和其他奇怪的工作，但梅林克斯有一种倾向，即恢复到他们更多的......野生性质。众所周知，他们偶尔会有一些有价值的物品 \"出现 \"在他们手中，却不知道它们是如何到达的。当然，如果被要求的话，他们会很乐意归还这些物品，但任何无人认领的物品都会被带到他们的家里保管，直到他们的主人来取回它们。对于那些寻求更多尊重的felyne和melynx来说，他们通常会加入猎人的行列，成为他们的伙伴，或者自己成为徘徊者。",
	"Felyne and Melynx that live in the wild are looked at as their own culture due to their intelligence, lifestyle, and groups. They are known to form villages in secluded areas, where most monsters wouldn't dare to venture to. These villages are known to have tribal exchanges with other lynians and other cultures. They are also known to worship the Wild Lords, with many felyne and melynx druids and rangers originating from these settlements.": "生活在野外的Felyne和Melynx由于其智慧、生活方式和群体，被视为自己的文化。众所周知，他们在大多数怪物不敢涉足的僻静地区形成村庄。众所周知，这些村庄与其他莱尼人和其他文化有部落交流。他们也被称为崇拜野生领主，许多费里尼和梅林克斯的德鲁伊和游侠都来自这些定居点。",
	"The gajalaka worship the Lord of Murder and answered his call for war during the Great Dragon War. They are outlanders much like their shakalaka cousins, but are aggressive towards all monsters and hunters that enter their territory. After the reemergence the few that remained after the war hid themselves away in an attempt to build their numbers back up. It wasn't until recent history that the gajalaka showed themselves once more. A gajalaka rarely works with anyone from the civilized world, unless exiled, or if it benefits them. They are also rarely accepted due to many of them being acolytes to the Lord of Murder, necromancers, criminals, or thieves.": "加加拉卡人崇拜谋杀之王，并在大龙战争期间响应他的战争号召。他们是外乡人，很像他们的沙卡拉卡表亲，但对所有进入他们领地的怪物和猎人都很有攻击性。在战争后重新出现的少数人把自己藏起来，试图重新建立起他们的数量。直到最近的历史，gajalaka才再次出现。gajalaka人很少与文明世界的人合作，除非被流放，或者对他们有利。他们也很少被接受，因为他们中的许多人是谋杀之主的信徒、死灵法师、罪犯或盗贼。",
	"The grimalkyne were once one large tribe during the time of the ancient civilization. They were outlanders, who lived off the land and worked in harmony with nature. They worshiped the Wild Lords and still do to this day.": "在古代文明时期，格里马基人曾经是一个大部落。他们是外乡人，以土地为生，与自然和谐相处。他们崇拜野生领主，直到今天仍然如此。",
	"The reason the grimalkyne split into the separate tribes of today during the Great Dragon War, was due to a disagreement between its four leaders. Each of them believed they were walking the grimalkyne down the correct path. The Bugtrappers tribe headed into the ancient forests, choosing to seclude themselves like the shakalaka. The Protectors and Troupers tribes joined the other races of the world in the fight against Fatalis and Tiamat. Those grimalkyne who become palicos or prowlers are typically from these two tribes. Finally the Plunderers tribe sought to scavenge the battlefields and other ruins of the world, gathering enough supplies to protect themselves.": "在大龙战争期间，格力玛尔基族之所以分裂成今天的独立部落，是由于其四位领导人之间存在分歧。他们每个人都认为自己是在为格力玛尔基人走正确的道路。捕虫人部落进入了古老的森林，选择像沙卡拉卡一样隐居起来。保护者和群居者部落加入了世界上的其他种族，与法塔里斯和提亚马特作战。那些成为帕里科人或徘徊者的格雷玛尔基人通常来自这两个部落。最后，掠夺者部落试图在战场和世界的其他废墟上搜刮，收集足够的物资来保护自己。",
	"After the reemergence the Bugtrappers remained in the forests as outlanders, hermits, and sages. They assist hunters and provide aid to those who enter their territories. The Protectors and Troupers took their leave, traveling into the deserts and high mountains to build their own communities. Occasionally these tribes have been known to send emissaries to towns, cities, and guilds as a sign of good will. The Plunderers tribe still remain scavengers and criminals. It is not unheard of for a Plunderers tribe grimalkyne to impersonate a Protector or Trouper as a way to enter a town or guild without suspicion.": "在重新出现后，捕虫人作为外乡人、隐士和圣人留在森林中。他们协助猎人，为进入他们领地的人提供帮助。保护者和驯兽师们离开了，进入沙漠和高山，建立他们自己的社区。偶尔，这些部落也会向城镇、城市和行会派遣使者，以示友好。掠夺者部落仍然是拾荒者和罪犯。掠夺者部落的格力马基恩冒充保护者或麻烦制造者，作为进入城镇或行会而不被怀疑的一种方式，这并不是没有听过。",
	"The Shakalaka are very similar to humans, in that they hunt and gather, but are less civilized in nature. Even before the rise of the ancient civilization the shakalaka had secluded themselves deep in the forests of the world. In doing so, the shakalaka avoided much of the carnage of the Great Dragon War, but also stunted their growth as a society, leaving themselves primitive and barbaric even after the reemergence. Even so, the shakalaka are a proud and barbaric subspecies of lynians, attacking most creatures, including hunters, on sight. Young shakalaka or, Ōme Shakalaka (unripe shakalaka) as they are known in their tribes, have been known to befriend hunters, helping them on their quests.": "沙卡拉卡人与人类非常相似，他们善于狩猎和采集，但本质上不太文明。甚至在古代文明兴起之前，Shakalaka人就把自己隐居在世界的森林深处。这样做，Shakalaka人避免了大龙战争的大部分屠杀，但也阻碍了他们作为一个社会的成长，使他们即使在重新崛起后也是原始而野蛮的。即便如此，Shakalaka是一个骄傲而野蛮的lynians亚种，一见到大多数生物，包括猎人，就会进行攻击。年轻的Shakalaka或，Ōme Shakalaka（未成熟的Shakalaka），在他们的部落中被称为，已经知道与猎人交好，帮助他们完成任务。",
	"Hunters typically encounter these young Shakalaka when they partake in a coming-of-age ritual in which they are sent out of their settlement to bring back items of great value to their tribe. This can take the form of a rare monster material, treasure, or an object with historical or cultural importance to the tribe (such as a special mask).": "猎人通常在参加成年仪式时遇到这些年轻的Shakalaka，他们被送出定居点，带回对他们部落有重大价值的物品。其形式可以是罕见的怪物材料、宝藏，或者是对部落具有历史或文化意义的物品（如特殊的面具）。",
	"Hunters are able to spot an Ōme Shakalaka by their mask. These masks aren't the usual telltale orange gourd masks that adult shakalaka wear. Instead young shakalaka wear masks of all varieties, most commonly acorn masks. Shakalaka that become palicos or prowlers are known to have full helms crafted from the creatures they've killed.": "猎人们能够通过面具来识别大梅沙卡拉卡。这些面具并不是成年Shakalaka所戴的那种常见的橙色葫芦面具。相反，年轻的Shakalaka戴着各种各样的面具，最常见的是橡子面具。众所周知，成为帕里科人或徘徊者的 \"沙卡拉卡 \"拥有用他们杀死的生物制作的全盔。",
	"Power hungry, unworthy, untrustworthy scoundrels, and abomination are many of the words that the races of the world used to describe the ancient tieflings. Created when a cult of teostra, shunned by the gods for their power hungry nature, began experimenting in an attempt to ascend by themselves. After numerous failed attempts, their leader cried out to the gods every night, begging for an answer, until he finally received one. Unknowingly under the guidance of the newly manifested Fatalis, the cultist succeeded in their endeavor, but not before killing their beloved teostra and completing the ritual by injecting its blood into their veins.": "权力饥渴、不值得、不值得信任的恶棍和可憎是世界上许多种族用来描述古代铁弗林的词语。当一个因权力饥渴而被众神回避的泰奥斯特拉教派开始尝试自己升天时，他们就产生了。在无数次失败的尝试之后，他们的领袖每晚都向诸神哭诉，乞求一个答案，直到他最终得到一个答案。在不知情的情况下，在新显现的法塔利斯的指导下，邪教组织成功地完成了他们的努力，但在杀死他们心爱的泰奥斯特拉并将其血液注入他们的血管以完成仪式之前。",
	"These first tieflings had a more beastial look similar to the teostra. They had a fiery coloration, thick horns that curve backwards, large fangs, and a tail that ended in a clump of fur. The males had long flowing red hair and a beard that resembled the teostra's flowing mane. Female tieflings' hair varied in length and the hair between their horns was varying shades of yellow.": "这些最初的Tieflings有一个更像野兽的外观，类似于Teostra。他们有着火红的颜色，向后弯曲的粗大的角，大獠牙，以及一条尾巴，尾巴的末端是一丛毛。雄性有飘逸的红色长发和胡须，类似于泰奥斯特拉的飘逸的鬃毛。雌性Tieflings的头发长短不一，它们的角之间的头发是深浅不一的黄色。",
	"Though they had ascended, they had committed an unspeakable act. Killing an elder dragon during this point in history was tantamount to attacking one of the Five themselves. The tieflings were forced to live as outlanders in small communities, or as hermits, but their allure of ascension brought those who felt ignored by the gods to their ranks. The tieflings continued to experiment with other elder dragon blood on the humans that came to them, creating new tieflings of all different colors and abilities. Their continual killing of the elder dragons did not go unnoticed. The Fifth Aspect, Eldath, sensed the blasphemy and the growing threat of the tieflings. So with the help of the other 4 Aspects, the tieflings were banished to the Lower Planes and the ritual was lost to the ages.": "虽然他们已经升天，但他们却犯下了不可告人的罪行。在历史上的这一时刻，杀死一条长老龙就等于攻击了五龙之一。盗贼们被迫作为外乡人生活在小社区里，或者作为隐士，但他们升天的诱惑力将那些感到被神明忽视的人带到了他们的队伍中。盗贼们继续用其他长老的龙血在来找他们的人类身上做实验，创造出各种不同颜色和能力的新盗贼。他们对长老龙的持续杀戮并没有被忽视。第五位Aspect，Eldath，感觉到了亵渎神灵的行为和铁皮人日益增长的威胁。因此，在其他四个方面的帮助下，铁皮人被驱逐到了下层世界，而这个仪式也消失在了历史长河中。",
	"The tieflings did not return to the material plane until the Great Dragon War. Their time in the Lower Planes had changed their appearance to the commonly known demonic look of today. Many of the tieflings fought in the archdevils armies, but tieflings were no longer predisposed to evil or power hungry as they once were. Those that sought to defect took the chance to escape and fight on the side of the Platinum Court and Wild Lords, who allowed them to remain on the material plane after the war had ended.": "盗贼直到大龙战争时才回到物质界。他们在下层世界的时间改变了他们的外貌，变成了今天常见的恶魔的样子。许多铁皮人在大恶魔的军队中作战，但铁皮人不再像以前那样有邪恶的倾向或权力欲。那些试图叛变的人抓住机会逃跑，并站在白金法庭和野性领主一边作战，后者允许他们在战争结束后留在物质界。",
	"Although their evil ancestors could be many generations removed, the taint lingered. Tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people are uncomfortable around them, whether they are aware of the tiefling's unsavory ancestry or not.": "虽然他们邪恶的祖先可能已经离开了很多代，但污点仍然存在。盗贼往往有一种令人不安的气息，大多数人在他们身边都很不自在，无论他们是否知道盗贼的不光彩的祖先。",
	"When these prejudices were put aside, the tieflings' cunning and personal allure, which made them excellent deceivers, also made them inspiring leaders. Members of other races find that once they demonstrate friendship and trust towards a tiefling, it would quickly be reciprocated in full. Once that bond was forged, it was rarely broken.": "当这些偏见被抛开时，铁皮人的狡猾和个人诱惑力，使他们成为优秀的欺骗者，也使他们成为鼓舞人心的领导者。其他种族的成员发现，一旦他们对铁皮人表现出友谊和信任，很快就会得到充分的回报。一旦这种关系被建立起来，就很少被打破。",
	"The tritons were the first humans to worship the Fives creation and as such were infused with the power of the sea. Due to this, many tritons come across as arrogant, but they are in fact benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a ceadeus awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.": "三角兽是第一批崇拜五行创造物的人类，因此被注入了海洋的力量。由于这一点，许多特里顿人表现得很傲慢，但实际上他们内心是善良的生物，确信其他文明种族值得他们保护。他们的态度可能会令人不快，但当海盗船队在海面上徘徊，或有一只塞拉德斯从沉睡中苏醒时，他们是第一个拿起武器保护他人的人。",
	"During the War of the Ancients, the tritons suffered massive defeats and many were twisted by Fatalis' offer of power, transforming them into sahuagins. It wasn't until Persana ascended to godhood that the tritons were finally able to push the sahuagins and other corrupt creatures back to the elemental plane of water.": "在古人的战争中，三体人遭受了巨大的失败，许多人被法塔里斯提供的力量扭曲了，把他们变成了萨瓦金人。直到Persana升为神，三体人终于能够将萨瓦金人和其他腐败的生物推回水元素界。",

So they began building some small settlements beside deep trenches and even some in other dangerous spots far from the land.": "在战争结束后，三体人被Persana委以重任，成为海洋的看守者。因此，他们开始在深海战壕旁建造一些小型定居点，甚至在远离陆地的其他危险地点建造一些定居点。",
	"That isn't to say that all triton's live so far from the other races. Many of them call Moga Village and many of the port towns across the Old World home.": "这并不是说所有的特里顿人都离其他种族那么远。他们中的许多人把莫加村和整个旧世界的许多港口城镇当作自己的家。",
	"Many triton's that live among the other races work as dockhands, shipwrights, or merchants in the ports. While others may join the hunters guild or other research guilds, using their unique attributes to their advantage.": "许多生活在其他种族中的特里顿人在港口担任码头工人、船工或商人。而其他人则可能加入猎人公会或其他研究公会，利用他们独特的属性来发挥自己的优势。",
	"Known as the forgefoots in ancient times, the troverians took their new name after the reemergence.

	"The troverians were an instrumental part of the ancient civilization, working with gnomes and dwarves and combining their technology with their own. It was this adaptability that led to the creation of the equal hunter weapons. It was one of their greatest accomplishments and greatest regrets.

	"The troverians live in the mountains and hills, in recent years they were welcomed to the village of Harth where they work together with the dwarves to develop new weapons and items for the Hunters Guild.

	"By the time of the Great Dragon War, the ancient civilization had made vast improvements to their original design. By pumping wyvern blood through their body and using energized streamstone as its core, the ancient civilization had produced a sapient hunter, now more commonly known as warforged. During the Great Dragon War, these warforged were not just front line soldiers and defenders of the many settlements across the world, they were also tasked with the collection of vast amounts of dragon blood to fuel the ancient civilizations newest weapon, the Equal Dragon Weapon. By the end of the war, all of the warforged had been destroyed, deactivated, or left incomplete in workshop ruins.": "到了大龙战争的时候，古老的文明已经对他们最初的设计进行了巨大的改进。通过将狼人的血液注入他们的身体，并使用能量化的流石作为核心，古代文明已经产生了一个有智慧的猎人，现在更多的是被称为战神。在大龙战争期间，这些战争锻造者不仅是前线士兵和世界各地许多定居点的保卫者，他们还负责收集大量的龙血，为古代文明的最新武器--平等龙武器提供燃料。在战争结束时，所有的战争锻造者都被摧毁，停用，或留在工场废墟中不完整。",
	"After the reemergence, there have been different points in history when a warforged or two have woken up, their programing either incomplete or degraded over time, these warforged have a greater range of free will, and as such, albeit begrudgingly by some of the races, have been recognized as a new species.": "在重新出现之后，历史上有不同的时间点，有一两个战神醒来，他们的程序要么不完整，要么随着时间的推移而退化，这些战神有更大范围的自由意志，因此，尽管被一些种族勉强接受，但已经被承认为一个新物种。",

Not all of these tools will be used by every DM and more tools may be added in the future and the guide grows.": "本章的目的是为管理员提供额外的工具来运行他们自己的怪物猎人风格的游戏。这些工具的范围包括指导DM如何创建自己的狩猎，以及创建自己的战利品表。并非所有这些工具都会被每个DM使用，将来可能会有更多的工具加入，而且指南也会不断增加。",
	"Creating a Hunt can be just as or more difficult than creating your own dungeon. The biggest challenge is how do you create a hunt that feels natural without building it like a normal dungeon? In this section you will find a set of variant rules to help you bring the feeling of monster hunter to D&D.": "创建一个猎场可能和创建自己的地牢一样或更难。最大的挑战是你如何创建一个感觉自然的狩猎，而不像普通的地牢那样建造它？在本节中，你会发现一套变体规则，以帮助你将怪物猎人的感觉带入D&D。",
	"Choosing which creature(s) is the first step and easiest step in creating your hunt. Typically a creature the PCs are hunting will be a deadly encounter with one or more creatures for the parties level.": "选择哪种生物是创建狩猎的第一步，也是最简单的一步。通常情况下，NPC要猎杀的生物将是一个致命的遭遇，有一个或多个符合当事人水平的生物。",
	"There are things to consider though when choosing your creature. In the monster hunter video game series, hunters would typically go up against a single deadly monster, but in 5e d&d the action economy does not handle solo boss fights well. So how do we adapt to the fight?": "不过在选择生物的时候，有一些事情需要考虑。在怪物猎人的视频游戏系列中，猎人通常会去对付一个致命的怪物，但在5e d&d中，行动经济并不能很好地处理单人BOSS战。那么，我们如何适应这种战斗呢？",
	"adding in lower CR creatures to the fight that if left alone may cause issues for the party.": "在战斗中加入低CR值的生物，如果放任不管可能会给党带来麻烦。",
	"A simpler version of the paragon monster system, you choose a monster that is weaker but acts as if it was multiple monsters. It has multiple turns per round equal to the number of monsters it is supposed to represent, and its hit points is equal to the total of all the monsters it would represent.": "一个更简单的准绳怪物系统版本，你选择一个较弱的怪物，但其行为就像多个怪物一样。它每回合有多个回合，等于它应该代表的怪物数量，它的命中率等于它将代表的所有怪物的总和。",
	"For 3 PCs, maximize the creature's hit points. For 4 PCs, maximize its hit points and then add an additional 50% more hit points to it. For 5 PCs maximize its hit points and then double it.": "对于3个NPC，最大化生物的命中率。对于4个NPC，最大化它的命中率，然后为它增加50%的命中率。对于5个NPC，最大限度地提高其命中率，然后将其加倍。",
	"Additionally due to their damage output on their turn, you might consider reducing the number of attacks its multiattack can make, and instead give it a number of legendary attack actions equal to the number of attacks removed from its multi attack": "另外由于它们在回合中的伤害输出，你可以考虑减少它的多重攻击可以进行的攻击次数，而给它一个相当于从它的多重攻击中删除的攻击次数的传奇攻击行动。",
	"Creating the creatures territory is the second step in setting up your hunt. The territory is just like a dungeon, but instead of rooms, it uses areas.": "创建生物领地是设置狩猎的第二步。领土就像一个地牢，但它使用的不是房间，而是区域。",
	"An area is a location within the monster's territory where something may be found or some type of event occurs. Each area should have some type of description, much like a room in a dungeon, and have an idea of what resources would be available.": "一个区域是怪物领地内的一个地点，在那里可以找到一些东西或发生一些类型的事件。每个区域都应该有某种类型的描述，就像地牢里的房间一样，并有一个可用资源的概念。",
	"Typically a hunt should have between 8-10 areas, some of which the party may or may not explore.": "通常情况下，一次狩猎应该有8-10个区域，其中一些区域可能会或可能不会被探索。",
	"Traveling between areas should take time. It might be 5 minutes, an hour, or 4 hours. This helps explain why creatures aren't aware of the party when they enter a new area or why the environment might change dramatically between them. Such as going from a muddy forested area to a full blown swamp.": "地区之间的旅行应该需要时间。它可能是5分钟、1小时或4小时。这有助于解释为什么生物在进入一个新的区域时没有意识到他们的存在，或者为什么环境在他们之间可能会发生巨大的变化。例如，从一个泥泞的森林地区到一个完整的沼泽地。",
	"How we incorporate these areas into the hunt and decide what might challenges might be in each area can be found in the {@i Tracking down your prey} section below.": "我们如何将这些领域纳入狩猎，并决定每个领域可能存在的挑战，可在下面的（%0%）部分找到。",
	"When the group heads out on a hunt, does the guild provide them with supplies? At lower rank hunts, probably. At higher ranks, they most likely have enough gold to supply themselves. Nonetheless, the guild supply chest is a great way as a GM to give your PCs supplies they might need in an immersive fashion, instead of just telling them that they get 2 potions of healing and a pickaxe before the game starts.": "当团队外出狩猎时，公会是否为他们提供物资？在低级别的狩猎中，可能会。在较高的等级中，他们很可能有足够的金币来供应自己。尽管如此，作为一个GM，公会补给箱是一个很好的方法，可以让你的NPC以一种身临其境的方式获得他们可能需要的补给，而不是在游戏开始前只告诉他们有两个治疗药水和一把镐。",
	"When a hunt begins, the PCs choose between 4 different roles to take on. These roles are the Trailblazer, Scout, Spotter, & Artisan. More information about these roles can be found in Chapter 2 character options, but a simple description of the roles are:": "当狩猎开始时，NPC会在4个不同的角色中选择自己的角色。这些角色是开拓者、侦察员、观察者和工匠。关于这些角色的更多信息可以在第二章角色选择中找到，但对这些角色的简单描述是：。",
	"Decides which way the party goes. They make survival checks that determine what type of complications or benefits the party encounters.": "决定党派走哪条路。他们进行生存检查，决定党派遇到什么类型的复杂情况或利益。",
	"The frontrunner of the group. They quietly scout the areas ahead and typically report their findings back to the group. Though it's not unheard of them waiting for the group to reach them instead.": "队伍中的排头兵。他们悄悄地侦查前方的区域，并通常将他们的发现报告给团队。不过也不是没有人等着队伍来找他们。",
	"The person responsible for keeping an eye out while the rest of the group focuses on their tasks. Can notice things the scout may have missed, or perhaps resources in an area.": "在小组其他成员专注于他们的任务时，负责留意的人。可以注意到侦察员可能遗漏的东西，或许是某个地区的资源。",
	"The chef, they provide boons at the start of hunts or during short or long rests.": "厨师，他们在狩猎开始时或在短期或长期休息时提供恩惠。",
	" There is no specific formula for creating the magical effects that the food grants the characters. If you create your own, the effects should provide minor useful bonuses that may or may not be situational. You should try not to overstep on class features when making your food.": " 在创造食物赋予人物的神奇效果方面没有具体的公式。如果你创造了自己的效果，那么这些效果应该提供轻微的有用的奖励，这些奖励可能是也可能不是情境性的。在制作食物时，你应该尽量不要超越等级特征。",
	"Sometimes the party may split up, when split into groups of two. The only roles available are the trailblazer and the spotter.": "有时，队伍可能会分开，当分成两组。可用的角色只有开拓者和观察者。",
	"If someone is alone, they are both the trailblazer and spotter, but they either have to choose to take disadvantage on their survival roll for finding signs or take a -4 to their passive perception.": "如果有人独自一人，他们既是开拓者又是观察者，但他们要么选择在寻找标志的生存卷上吃亏，要么对他们的被动感知力采取-4。",
	"Tracking down the creature the party is hunting is the main goal of monster hunters. So how do we find the creature? As a GM, do we just put it down in an area and say that is where it is always going to be? do we put it in the last area and they eventually get to it, much like the end of a dungeon?": "追踪党所猎杀的生物是怪物猎人的主要目标。那么，我们怎样才能找到这个生物呢？作为GM，我们是否只是把它放在一个区域，然后说它一直在那里？我们是否把它放在最后一个区域，他们最终会找到它，就像地下城的尽头？",
	"NO! This creature is in the wilderness; it travels around, leaves signs, and acts like any animal would. That is what the system below is designed to represent. The party travels around the creature's territory, dealing with environmental hazards, skill challenges, and other creatures while searching for signs of their prey.": "不! 这种生物在荒野中；它到处旅行，留下痕迹，像任何动物一样行事。这就是下面这个系统所设计的内容。队伍在该生物的领地周围旅行，处理环境危险、技能挑战和其他生物，同时寻找猎物的迹象。",
	"On the hunt, the party must discover signs of the creature: distant roars, tracks, marking, fresh kills, etc. {@b The party will need to typically find between 3 and 5 signs. Once they do, they locate the monster and the final battle of the hunt begins.}": "在狩猎过程中，党必须发现生物的迹象：远处的吼声、足迹、标记、新鲜的杀戮等（%0%）。",
	"When you are on a hunt, the creature you are looking for is not the only one in the area. One of the GM options in the minor and major challenges is finding false signs. These signs work the same as finding signs for the current creature you are hunting. Once you find 3-5 of these false signs, a hard or deadly encounter occurs.": "当你在打猎的时候，你要找的生物并不是该地区唯一的生物。在小挑战和大挑战中，GM的一个选项是寻找虚假的标志。这些标志的作用与寻找你正在猎杀的当前生物的标志相同。一旦你发现了3-5个这样的假标志，就会发生一个困难或致命的遭遇。",
	"It is typically best to know what creature the PCs will encounter when they find these false signs. It wouldn't make much sense if they are finding tufts of fur and then end up fighting a rathalos.": "通常情况下，最好是知道NPC在发现这些虚假迹象时将会遇到什么生物。如果他们发现的是毛绒绒的东西，最后却要与拉塔罗斯战斗，那就没有什么意义了。",
	"Whenever the trailblazer rolls a survival check for entering an area, the GM rolls on the table below to determine what signs, challenges, or benefits they may find in the area.": "每当开拓者为进入一个区域进行生存检查时，GM就会在下面的表格上进行滚动，以确定他们在这个区域可能会发现什么迹象、挑战或好处。",
	"major challenge": "重大挑战",
	"minor challenge": "小挑战",
	"1 sign, minor challenge": "1个标志，小挑战",
	"2 signs, benefit": "2个标志，受益",
	"If the trailblazer rolls anything less than an 18 on their Tracking Roll, they must overcome a challenge on their hunt. These challenges can be either minor or major, depending on the result. Likewise, if a group rolls a 20 on their Tracking roll, they come across a benefit that can seriously aid them in their hunt.": "如果追踪者在他们的追踪卷上掷出的分数低于18分，他们必须在狩猎中克服一个挑战。这些挑战可以是小的，也可以是大的，视结果而定。同样地，如果一个小组在追踪卷上掷出20分，他们就会遇到一个可以严重帮助他们狩猎的好处。",
	"Minor Challenges include non combat encounters, skill checks, or minor environmental hazards. They might also include minor combats against weaker foes (medium difficulty encounter). In general, a minor challenge should cost a few resources and be a minor setback, but shouldn't stop the PCs dead in their tracks.": "小挑战包括非战斗性的遭遇，技能检查，或小的环境危险。它们也可能包括与较弱的敌人进行的小规模战斗（中等难度的遭遇战）。一般来说，小挑战应该花费一些资源，并且是一个小挫折，但不应该让NPC死在他们的轨道上。",
	"Major Challenges are potentially deadly or severely hinder the party. A major challenge might include a dangerous environmental hazard, a deadly encounter, expending limited resources such as spell slots or items. They shouldn't be impossible to overcome but should require MUCH more effort from the PCs.": "主要的挑战是潜在的致命的或严重的阻碍党。主要挑战可能包括危险的环境危害、致命的遭遇、消耗有限的资源（如法术槽或物品）。这些挑战不应该是不可能克服的，但应该需要NPC做出更大的努力。",
	"Benefits are a boon to the party. These could be a hidden cache of hunter supplies, the carvable corpse of a recently deceased monster that is normally outside the parties ability to kill, or anything else the GM might come up with. Below you will find a list of generic suggestions for benefits, challenges, or signs:": "利益是对当事人的一种恩惠。这些好处可以是隐藏的猎人用品，可以是最近死去的怪物的可雕刻的尸体，这些怪物通常不在当事人的能力范围内，或者是GM可能想到的其他东西。下面你会发现一个关于利益、挑战或标志的通用建议列表。",

	"The first thing I do is decide on the creature for this hunt, a {@creature Yian Kut-ku|MHMM} (CR 3) which will take 3 signs to find. My false sign creature will be a {@creature Blue Yian Kut-ku|MHMM} (CR 5) that takes 5 signs to locate. Most likely they will need to run from it, but with some luck they could kill it.": "我做的第一件事是决定这次狩猎的生物，一个{@creature Yian Kut-ku|MHMM}(CR 3)，需要3个标志才能找到。我的假信号生物将是一个{@creature Blue Yian Kut-ku|MHMM}(CR 5)，需要5个信号才能找到。最有可能的是，他们需要逃离它，但如果运气好的话，他们可以杀死它。",

	"The trailblazer is up next, as the group leaves the starting area and moves towards area 1 they make a DC 12 survival check. They roll a 17. As the GM that means I roll a d20 on the finding signs table, keeping it hidden to prevent any type of metagaming, I roll a 11. Consulting the finding signs table, it means they find 1 sign (a broke kut-ku scale) and a minor challenge occurs in area 1. I choose the 4 velociprey minor challenge.": "接下来是开路先锋，当这群人离开起始区域并向1号区域移动时，他们做了一个DC12的生存检查。他们掷出了17分。作为GM，这意味着我在寻找标志的表格上掷了一个D20，为了防止任何类型的元游戏，我把它隐藏起来，我掷了一个11。查看寻找标志表，这意味着他们找到了一个标志（一个破碎的Kut-ku秤），并且在1号区域发生了一个小挑战。我选择了4个伶人的小挑战。",
	"Now the scout is up, they go on ahead to scout out the area. I have them roll a stealth check (18) and a perception check (12). Upon their arrival into area 1, I describe the area. The scout goes unseen by the velociprey who are currently head first into a aptonoth carcass. With such a low perception they don't notice the kut-ku scale in the grassy fields. With the group still about 10 minutes back, the scout returns and relays the information he saw.": "现在侦查员上场了，他们继续往前走，探查这个地区。我让他们进行隐身检查（18）和感知检查（12）。他们到达1号区域后，我描述了这个区域。侦察员没有被目前正一头扎进阿普顿斯尸体的伶人发现。由于感知力太低，他们没有注意到草场上的Kut-ku规模。当这群人还在后面10分钟的时候，侦察员回来了，把他看到的信息转达给了他们。",
	"Once regrouped, the party continues into area 1 stealthily. While the spotter keeps an eye out with their passive Perception, the scout points out the velociprey up ahead. Most are still feeding on the aptonoth, but one is up and wandering around. With some careful planning, the party quickly wipes out the velociprey and carves their bodies for materials. During this time, the spotter finds the broken kut-ku scale using their passive Perception and the hunt continues on...": "集合后，队伍继续隐蔽地进入1号区域。观察者用他们的被动感知力留意着，而侦察员则指出前面的天鹅绒动物。大多数人仍在以阿普顿斯为食，但有一只已经起来并四处游荡。通过一些精心的计划，他们很快就消灭了这些天鹅绒动物，并把它们的尸体雕刻成材料。在这期间，观察者利用他们的被动感知能力找到了破碎的库特库鳞片，狩猎继续进行......",

	"While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.": "在旅行时，一群冒险者可以以正常、快速或缓慢的速度移动，如旅行速度表所示。该表说明了一行人在一段时期内可以走多远，以及步伐是否有任何影响。快步走会使人物的感知力下降，而慢步走则可以潜行，并更仔细地搜索一个区域。",

	"With the additional rules you will read below, the party has the chance of 14 random encounters during a week of travel.

Next you need to determine how many runes the material has.": "当创建一个有符文的材料时，你首先需要确定该材料效果是否会有多个能力或法术，你可以消耗符文，或者该材料只有一个能力或法术，你可以消耗符文。接下来你需要确定该材料有多少符文。",
	"Materials effects that have a single ability or spell typically have 2, 3, 5, or 7 charges and you only have to expend 1 charge to use the ability or spell. When determining how many runes to give the material effect you need to take into consideration many uses keeps it the effect balanced. Common materials 2 runes or once per day, Uncommon typically have 3 runes, and rare and higher materials can vary between 3, 5, and 7 charges.": "具有单一能力或咒语的材料效果通常有2、3、5或7个电荷，你只需要消耗1个电荷就可以使用该能力或咒语。当决定给材料效果多少符文时，你需要考虑到多次使用可以保持效果平衡。普通材料2个符文或每天一次，不普通的材料通常有3个符文，而稀有和更高的材料可以在3、5和7个收费之间变化。",
	"Materials that have multiple options to expend its runes on (Most often, multiple spell options), are a bit more complicated. The number of runes this type of material has can vary and you can adjust the number as you see fit, though most often it has 5 (rare or lower rarity) or 10 charges (rare or higher rarity). The goal behind this material type, is to allow 3-5+ uses before it needs to recharge. This is accomplished by having different rune costs for each effect.": "有多种选择来消耗其符文的材料（最常见的是多种法术选择），就比较复杂了。这类材料的符文数量可能不同，你可以根据自己的需要调整，不过最常见的是它有5个（稀有或较低稀有度）或10个收费（稀有或较高稀有度）。这种材料类型背后的目标是在它需要充电之前允许3-5次以上的使用。这是通过为每个效果设置不同的符文费用来实现的。",
	"Spells are the best example for this; Spells have a rune cost equal to their spell level, so a 6th level spell costs 6 runes, a 1st level spell only requires you to expend 1 rune, and a 3rd level spell requires you to expend 3 runes.": "法术是这方面最好的例子；法术的符文成本等于其法术等级，所以6级法术需要6个符文，1级法术只需要你消耗1个符文，3级法术需要你消耗3个符文。",
	"From the information above, if you had a 10 rune material, you could expend 6 runes to cast the 6th level spell, then 1 rune for that 1st level spell, before expending your last three runes to cast the 3rd level spell. In another case, the character might cast three 3rd level spells and one level spell; or perhaps they cast ten 1st level spells.": "从上面的信息来看，如果你有一个10符文的材料，你可以消耗6个符文来施放6级法术，然后用1个符文施放那个1级法术，再消耗最后3个符文施放3级法术。在另一种情况下，这个角色可能会施放三个三级法术和一个等级法术；或者他们可能会施放十个一级法术。",
	"Runes with multiple options need a detriment, or most of them could almost be considered legendary quality magic items. Much like the {@item staff of frost} and {@item staff of fire} found in the DMG, expending all your runes can be detrimental, though not as bad as those two staves. When you expend all your runes on one of these materials, you roll a d20. On a 1, you can't regain any expend runes for this material. It's a painful effect, but it is still better than the two staves that are destroyed when you roll a 1 in a normal campaign.": "有多种选择的符文需要一个不利因素，或者说大部分的符文几乎可以被认为是传奇品质的魔法物品。就像DMG中的{@item staff of frost}和{@item staff of fire}一样，消耗你所有的符文也是有害的，虽然没有那两根棍子那么糟糕。当你在这些材料上耗尽你所有的符文时，你要掷一个D20。如果是1，你就不能为这种材料重新获得任何消耗的符文。这是一个痛苦的效果，但它仍然比在正常的战役中当你掷出1时被摧毁的那两根棍子好。",
	"Finally, when you are making these materials, make sure you are still only granting the spells that are weaker or equal to their rarity. An uncommon material shouldn't have a 7th level spell as an option to expend your charges on.": "最后，当你制作这些材料时，要确保你仍然只赋予那些较弱的或与它们的稀有性相等的法术。一个不常见的材料不应该有一个7级的法术作为选项来消耗你的费用。",
	" When expended runes recharge can vary. Most commonly, runes recharge daily at dawn, but other options exist. They could also be regained at: dusk; a couple days; weekly; after a long rest; or a short or long rest.": " 消耗的符文何时充能会有所不同。最常见的是，符文每天在黎明时分充能，但也有其他选择。它们也可以在以下时间重新获得：黄昏；几天；每周；长时间休息后；或短期或长期休息。",
	"The number of charges they regain can also vary. Typically material roll to recharge their full amount. Typically this is either a 1d3, 1d4+1, or 1d6+1. If you don't use the standard charges, you will need to determine what the player rolls to recharge their material.": "他们重新获得的电荷数量也会有所不同。通常情况下，材料滚动来充能他们的全部数量。通常这是一个1d3，1d4+1，或1d6+1。如果你不使用标准电荷，你将需要确定玩家滚动什么来补充他们的材料。",
	"In other cases, with powerful materials effects, they may not roll for their full amount instead rolling for closer to 80% of their charges. In the case of 10 charges, the player would roll 1d8, with 5 charges it would be a 1d4. It is up to you to decide on which type of recharge the material deserves.": "在其他情况下，如果有强大的材料效果，他们可能不会掷出全额，而是掷出接近80%的费用。在10次充电的情况下，玩家将滚动1d8，5次充电则是1d4。由你来决定材料应该得到哪种类型的充能。",
	"Below you will find a list of named material effects found in the Monster Hunter Monster Loot Tables organized by rarity. These material effects can be used in your own monster loot tables if you believe they fit, or may work as a guide for creating your own effects.": "下面你会发现在《怪物猎人》怪物战利品表中发现的命名材料效果列表，按稀有度排列。如果你认为这些材料效果适合，可以在你自己的怪物战利品表中使用，也可以作为创建你自己效果的指南。",

It is not uncommon for a hunter to be out on a hunt during an eruption.": "火山位于北埃尔德地区。它是该地区最大的火山，也是更为严酷和荒凉的地方。这个地区的熔岩流在附近行走很危险，它在夜间溢出，造成地形的变化。地面上也到处都是爆炸性的岩石，这些岩石是由该地区的挥发性矿物形成的。猎人在火山爆发期间外出狩猎的情况并不罕见。",
	"The Old Volcano was the first hunting ground designated by the Hunter's Guild in the north el de region. The area is an active volcano and the surrounding area. A camp has been set up at the base of the mountain, where the hunters can explore the surrounding area before making the journey to the molten center. On their journey they will travel through many caves, emerging from them before they can begin their perilous ascent to the peak. Withering heat demands that hunters use cool drinks if they wish to venture into this land. Hunters should also be wary of strange rocks which can explode violently when damaged.": "老火山是猎人公会在北埃尔德地区指定的第一个狩猎场。该地区是一座活火山和周边地区。在山脚下设立了一个营地，猎人们可以在前往熔岩中心之前探索周围的区域。在旅途中，他们将穿过许多洞穴，在开始危险的登顶前从这些洞穴中走出来。枯燥的热量要求猎人如果想冒险进入这片土地，就必须使用清凉饮料。猎人还应该警惕奇怪的岩石，这些岩石在损坏后会发生剧烈的爆炸。",
	"Due to the little vegetation to be found, the Old Volcano is home to only the heartiest of creatures, including the Basarios, Gravios, Azure Rathalos, Yian Kut-Ku, Iodrome and Shogun Ceanataur. The low vegetation also means poor gathering in the ways of herbs and insects. These two shortcomings are far overcome by an overwhelming abundance of ores and minerals to be mined.": "由于植被稀少，老火山只住着最强壮的生物，包括巴萨里奥斯、格拉维奥斯、蔚蓝拉塔洛斯、伊安库特库、伊德洛姆和幕府将军西纳图尔。植被少也意味着在草药和昆虫方面的采集能力差。这两个缺点被压倒性的丰富的矿石和矿物的开采所远远克服。",
	"Aptly named the 'battleground', this hunting ground is located in the back-end of the Volcanic Belt. Getting to the battleground is no easy task due to the mile wide lava rivers that flow around the area, but it is nothing compared to the beasts that call it home. Ferocious beasts such as the Fatalis and Akantor make their lair in this large barren space. Due to this, the guild has never been able to set up a base camp in this area, and it is impossible to leave the area without use of magic or an airship like the Soaratorium.": "这个狩猎场被恰当地命名为 \"战场\"，位于火山带的后端。由于周围流淌着一英里宽的熔岩河，到达战场并不是一件容易的事，但与把它当作家的野兽相比，这算不了什么。凶猛的野兽，如法塔利斯（Fatalis）和阿坎托尔（Akantor），都在这个大的荒芜空间中筑巢。由于这个原因，公会从来没有能够在这个地区建立一个大本营，如果不使用魔法或像Soaratorium这样的飞艇，就不可能离开这个地区。",
	"The Lava Canyon is found at the very center of the Volcanic Belt. It is a sunken area surrounded by ever flowing lava falls from all directions. These lava falls feed the lava pool surrounding the massive lava rock and ash covered patch of ground in the center of the area. Creatures like the Akantor have been known to make this area their lair.": "熔岩峡谷位于火山带的最中心。它是一个被来自四面八方不断流动的熔岩瀑布包围的凹陷区域。这些熔岩瀑布为该地区中心的巨大熔岩和火山灰覆盖的地面周围的熔岩池提供了能量。像阿坎托尔（Akantor）这样的生物已经知道将这个地区作为他们的巢穴。",
	"The Sacred Land is a remote area somewhere within the volcanic region. Due to the extreme heat, a Cold Drink is required for any hunter venturing into this land. Much like the battlegrounds, this area has been the lair for an alatreon in the past. Within the sacred lands is a circular patch of land that is enclosed by a lava river, and contains two pools of lava in its center. The base camp is set up behind a crevasse in the mountain wall where hunters and scouts can rest. However, it is no easy task to climb the obsidian walls to the camp.": "圣地是火山地区的某个偏远地区。由于极端炎热，任何进入这片土地的猎人都需要喝冷饮。与战场一样，这片区域过去曾是阿拉泰隆的巢穴。在圣地内有一片圆形的土地，被一条熔岩河包围着，中心有两个熔岩池。大本营设立在山壁的一个裂缝后面，猎人和侦察员可以在这里休息。然而，要爬上黑曜石墙到营地并不是一件容易的事。",
	"The South El De Region is a region consisting of a cluster of islands in the sea. This region is home to a fishing village near the shores of its volcanic belt. This village only trades with residents of the nearby islands, such as Jumbo Village, due to North El De Region's harsh volcanoes.": "南埃尔德地区是一个由海中岛屿群组成的地区。这个地区在其火山带的海岸附近有一个渔村。这个村子只与附近岛屿的居民进行交易，如珍宝村，因为北埃尔德地区的火山很恶劣。",
	"Unlike the other volcanoes in the El De Region, this hunting ground is located on an island to the west of Jumbo Village in the south el de region. This volcano has remained simply \"The Volcano\" without any prefixes or name changes.": "与埃尔德地区的其他火山不同，这个狩猎场位于埃尔德地区南部珍宝村以西的一个岛屿上。这座火山一直只是 \"火山\"，没有任何前缀或名称的变化。",
	"This hunting ground is a volatile location; it begins with low, forested areas, before moving to the base of the volcano, where lava collides with water, creating a curtain of steam at the shoreline. In addition, this volcano differentiates itself in that it has no dry, craggy, rocky areas, and the actual volcano is visible from camp, as opposed to ominous dark clouds in the distance. From the sea shore, the center volcano can be found, and finally the towering peak.": "这个狩猎场是一个不稳定的地方；开始是低矮的森林地区，然后是火山的底部，熔岩与水碰撞，在海岸线上形成一道蒸汽幕。此外，这座火山的不同之处在于，它没有干燥、峭壁、岩石的区域，而且从营地可以看到真正的火山，而不是远处不祥的乌云。从海边，可以找到中心火山，最后是高耸的山峰。",
	" Today, I'm researching volcanoes. More specifically, I'm looking at one that is the fascination of eccentric hunters everywhere, the Old Volcano. ... Instructor, are you trying to kill me?": " 今天，我在研究火山。更具体地说，我正在研究一个让各地古怪的猎人着迷的火山，即老火山。... 教官，你想杀了我吗？",
	"Anyway, I made a nice discovery before I even formally started my research. Looking into the spring at my camp, I found it was populated with the ultra-rare Goldenfish. Thinking that it must be a good sign, I set out for the volcanic caverns, which are filled with rivers of molten lava, in good spirits.": "总之，在我正式开始研究之前，我有了一个不错的发现。观察我营地的泉水，我发现里面住着极其罕见的金鱼。我想这一定是个好兆头，于是我精神抖擞地出发去火山岩洞，那里到处都是熔岩河。",
	"So what are volcanoes good for? Why, ores, of course! And as expected, I found some good mining points. Still riding the wave of good vibrations, I headed deeper into the volcano with plenty of Cool Drinks in tow, of course. Oh, but how wrong I was to think that things were going to be easy...": "那么，火山有什么用？为什么呢，当然是矿石了! 正如预期的那样，我发现了一些好的采矿点。我仍然乘着良好的振动浪潮，向火山深处走去，当然，还带着大量的清凉饮料。哦，但我以为事情会很容易，那就大错特错了......",
	"In the bowels of the cave, a Gravios with its devastatingly hard shell stood at the ready. It took a deep breath and giant boulders came tumbling down as it unleashed its intense heat ray. I tried to dodge, but my feet wouldn't budge nary an inch. ": "在山洞的深处，一只拥有毁灭性的坚硬外壳的格拉维奥斯站在那里准备着。它深吸一口气，当它释放出强烈的热射线时，巨石滚滚而下。我试图躲避，但我的脚却寸步难行。",
	" Just when I thought all was lost.": " 就在我以为一切都没了的时候。",
	"...the hunters who came to my rescue in the Old Swamp came out of nowhere and saved me again! Just when we thought we were in the clear, another Gravios reared its ugly head. It was like the apocalypse had come!

	"But we were now very low on Cool Drinks, and the hunters' wounds were severe. Searching for a way to help, I took a look around the entrance. To my surprise, I found some large ancient stones If we can decipher these, they could be the key to propelling our research forward. That's when I knew I couldn't die yet!": "但是我们现在的清凉饮料已经非常少了，而且猎人的伤势也很严重。为了寻找帮助，我在入口处看了一下。令我惊讶的是，我发现了一些大型的古代石头 如果我们能破译这些石头，它们可能是推动我们研究的关键。这时我知道我还不能死!",
	"Yes, and at that moment, I spied the gently swaying stalks of a Dragon Seed plant between tall plumes of volcanic smoke! I took some and combined it to make Dragon Ammo. I remembered what you said, Instructor, that no matter how strong they are against dragon element, if you shoot between the plates of its shell... This was our last shot!": "是的，就在那一刻，我在高高的火山烟之间看到了轻轻摇曳的龙种植物的茎秆！我取了一些，并将其混合在一起制成了龙弹。我拿了一些，并把它组合起来，做成了龙弹。我记得你说过，教官，不管他们对龙元素有多强，如果你在它的壳板之间射击...... 这是我们的最后一击!",
	"Gunfire, explosions, roars... It's all a big blur. But the next thing I clearly remember is all of us walking back into camp. Wounded all over, we piled into the boat that would take us home. I took this time to further examine the ancient stones I'd found. There is a sort of ancient text carved on them, but I have no idea what it says.": "枪声、爆炸声、吼声......。这一切都很模糊。但接下来我清楚地记得，我们所有人都走回了营地。浑身是伤的我们挤上了将带我们回家的船。我利用这段时间进一步检查了我发现的古代石头。上面刻着一种古老的文字，但我不知道它写了什么。",
	"The knowledge we get from my research, the passion of the moment, and teamwork... These are the important aspects of practical experience that you wanted me to understand, right!? ": "我们从我的研究中得到的知识，当时的激情，以及团队合作......。这些都是你希望我了解的实践经验的重要方面，对吗！？",

	"That's what I was thinking, but after a while, I began to think that it's a rather disagreeable teaching method. I mean, I was always one breath away from death! That's why I've decided that from now on, I will go on research trips and practicals with you, and only you, Instructor. Carpe diem!": "我也是这么想的，但过了一会儿，我开始觉得这是个相当令人不快的教学方法。我的意思是，我总是离死亡只有一口气! 这就是为什么我决定，从现在开始，我将和你一起去研究旅行和实践，而且只有你，教官。胜利在望",
	"Said to have been created by the Sand God, Odibatorasu, during the time of the ancient civilization. A once vast inhospitable barren waste land on the western side of the Old World was claimed by the monster as its own territory. The Odibatorasu burrowed through the ground grinding the bones, earth, and fossilized plants into a fine sand, terraforming the land into the deserts found today. It is unknown what stopped the Sand God from expanding its territory beyond the edge of the Old Jungle, some believe the ancient civilization killed it during the Great Dragon War, while others believe it to be hibernating deep below the desert, perhaps it feared the black dragon of the Schrade Region, or maybe its purpose the gods gave it was fulfilled.": "据说是由沙神Odibatorasu在古代文明时期创造的。在旧世界的西边，曾经有一片广袤的荒芜之地，被这个怪物宣称为自己的领土。奥迪巴托拉苏钻入地下，将骨头、泥土和植物化石磨成细沙，将土地改造成今天的沙漠。是什么阻止了沙神将其领土扩展到旧丛林的边缘，不得而知，有人认为古文明在大龙战争中杀死了它，也有人认为它在沙漠深处冬眠，也许它害怕施德拉德地区的黑龙，也可能是众神赋予它的目的已经实现了。",

Please...?": "...或者说，如果这里不是如此炽热，我就会报告！我的动机是红色的。我把这个放在一起的动机是红色的。我已经喝了很多清凉饮料，我的胃正威胁着要造反。作为奖励，我已经彻底干枯了，沙子把我的舌头变成了一张砂纸。我可以回家了吗...？求你了......？",
	"Anyway... Right, work. I took a quick walk and found that the Old Desert, while expansive, is enclosed on all sides by cliffs.

Could I have stumbled onto something incredibly big here!?": "总之... 对了，工作。我快速走了一圈，发现旧沙漠虽然广阔，但四面都被悬崖包围着。富含矿石的小洞穴点缀其间，我甚至还发现了一个似乎是食草狼人的巢穴！？难道我在这里偶然发现了什么不可思议的大东西！？",
	"Chewing on a Cephalos Fin, I made my way to the underground lake on the north side where I took a break. I also finally had the chance to use a Bugnet and collect some bugs.

The ceadeus fled after a long, drawn out battle, and the villager rejoiced over the victory.

Many of their blood vessels and veins can be seen through their pale skin. Their tail features a specialized orifice which bonds to the ground during electrical attacks and helps them cling onto cave ceilings. Their mouth features rows of sharp teeth. Khezu feet lack claws, and instead have suction pad-like toes to assist them in climbing and hanging from cave walls and ceilings. Spending most of their lives in the dark, their eyes have regressed greatly, though they make up for this with a superb sense of smell. A layer of fat helps to keep them warm and prolong the time they can spend hunting for food. Khezu have an extendable neck which allows them to grasp and ambush prey from afar, such as from a cave ceiling. Khezu are hermaphrodites, which means an individual is both male and female. To reproduce they paralyze a creature and inject their young, known as Whelps. The Whelps grow inside their victim until it dies, or when they are strong enough to leave.": "Khezu是大型的、苍白的Wyverns，有一张松弛的、橡胶的皮，它们经常保持潮湿，类似于两栖动物的皮。透过它们苍白的皮肤，可以看到它们的许多血管和静脉。它们的尾巴上有一个特殊的孔，在电击时能与地面结合，并帮助它们紧紧抓住洞穴的天花板。它们的嘴里有一排排锋利的牙齿。Khezu的脚没有爪子，而是有类似吸盘的脚趾，以帮助它们攀爬和悬挂在洞壁和天花板上。他们的大部分时间都在黑暗中度过，他们的眼睛已经大大退步，尽管他们以极好的嗅觉来弥补这一点。一层脂肪帮助他们保持温暖，延长他们狩猎食物的时间。Khezu有一个可伸展的脖子，这使它们能够从远处抓取和伏击猎物，例如从洞穴的天花板。Khezu是雌雄同体，这意味着一个个体既是男性又是女性。为了繁衍后代，它们会麻痹一个生物，并注射它们的幼崽，即所谓的Whelps。胎儿在受害者体内生长，直到受害者死亡，或者当它们足够强大可以离开时。",

	"On a failed check, Zuri was unable to create the meal as she had planned, this could be due to a lack of fruit she was able to obtain, her recipe was incorrect, or perhaps she removed it from the fire too soon.
