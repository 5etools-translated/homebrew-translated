	"An iconic moment in fantasy fiction is the grand tournament. From the archery contests of Robin Hood to the jousts of Ivanhoe, it seems like half the stories about the Middle Ages have the heroes attend such a festival somewhere along the line. Whether honoring the king's birthday, the birth of a saint, the nation's victory over its enemies, or just because it's Midsummer's Day, festive pavilions are raised and flags and pennants flap in the rising breeze to signal that it is time for the main event to begin! However, even in the real-world tournaments were about far more than bows and lances, and in a fantasy game the options for what would constitute a friendly (or even not-so-friendly) competition are infinitely varied, from gritty and brutal feats of raw strength to magical marvels of the highest fantasy. That is what Royal Tournaments is all about. It provides a fantastic resource for incorporating tournaments and festivals into your campaign, including an array of different tournament events and awards, some physical, some magical, some social, and all delightful. Whether your players want to promote the interests of their own kingdom or simply fight for glory and prizes, Royal Tournaments has everything you need to make the tournaments in your campaign magnificent and memorable. Legendary Games was founded on the principle of delivering first-class product for your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game experience, brought to you by the very authors who design and contribute to the adventures, hardbacks, and campaign supplements you are already using. The Legendary Games tradition is to combine rich story and background, innovative layout, beautiful aesthetics, and excellence in design that is second to none. This product is the latest in that tradition, and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it. Game on!": "奇幻小说中的一个标志性时刻是大比武。从罗宾汉的射箭比赛到伊凡诺的比武，似乎一半的中世纪故事都有英雄们在某处参加这样一个节日。无论是纪念国王的生日、圣人的诞生、国家对敌人的胜利，还是仅仅因为是仲夏节，节日的亭子都会升起，旗帜和旗帜在升起的微风中飘扬，以示主要活动开始的时间! 然而，即使在现实世界中，锦标赛的内容也远远超过了弓箭和长矛，而在一个幻想游戏中，构成友好（甚至不友好）竞争的选项是无限多样的，从原始力量的粗暴和残酷的壮举到最高幻想的魔法奇迹。这就是《皇家锦标赛》的全部内容。它为将锦标赛和节日纳入你的活动提供了一个奇妙的资源，包括一系列不同的锦标赛活动和奖项，有些是物理的，有些是魔法的，有些是社会的，而且都是令人愉快的。无论你的玩家是想促进自己王国的利益，还是仅仅为了荣誉和奖品而战，《皇家锦标赛》都有你所需要的一切，使你的战役中的锦标赛宏伟而令人难忘。传奇游戏公司成立的原则是为您的开拓者角色扮演游戏体验提供一流的产品，这些产品由设计您已经在使用的冒险、精装书和战役补充材料并为之作出贡献的作者带来。传奇游戏的传统是将丰富的故事和背景、创新的布局、美丽的美学和卓越的设计结合起来，这是首屈一指的。本产品是这一传统的最新成果，我们希望你能像我们制作它一样喜欢使用它。游戏开始!",
	"While player characters are used to living lives of high adventure with chances for glorious victory or potentially fatal failure lurking around every corner, they may sometimes lose sight of the fact that most people in the world they inhabit are not so lucky. True, the common folk perhaps have a different kind of luck, one which involves far less risk of death on a daily basis, but there is still something terribly romantic and exciting about being able to at least play at the kind of dramatics and heroics they hear about in the stories. That is where Royal Tournaments come in! Every now and then, it is time for a festival, and while competitions and mock battles often play a large part they are hardly the only element to entice the common folk. Festivals can be held for many purposes, and these are no different in a fantasy world than they are in the real world.": "虽然玩家角色习惯于过着高度冒险的生活，每个角落都潜伏着辉煌的胜利或潜在的致命失败的机会，但他们有时可能会忽略一个事实，即他们居住的世界中的大多数人都没有这么幸运。诚然，普通人也许有一种不同的运气，一种每天涉及的死亡风险要小得多的运气，但能够至少发挥他们在故事中听到的那种戏剧性和英雄主义，仍然有一些可怕的浪漫和兴奋。这就是皇家锦标赛的意义所在 每隔一段时间，就会有一个节日，虽然比赛和模拟战斗经常发挥很大的作用，但它们并不是吸引普通民众的唯一因素。举行节日的目的有很多，这些在幻想世界中与现实世界中没有什么不同。",
	"Festivals can generally be divided into two categories: civic and religious. Civic festivals may commemorate the founding of a nation or a city, or the birth of a great leader or hero, or the overthrow of a hated tyrant. Celebrations may mark the day of a mighty battle, mixing celebration of victory with a solemn memorial of those lost in the struggle, or the consummation of peace after a long period of strife. Civic festivals may celebrate the life of a particular person of great renown, or they may be aimed at the entire populace. Likewise, they may be local to a single city or locality, or they may be widespread across an entire continent.": "节日一般可分为两类：公民性节日和宗教性节日。民间节日可能是为了纪念一个国家或城市的建立，或伟大领袖或英雄的诞生，或推翻一个可恨的暴君。庆祝活动可能标志着一场强大的战斗的日子，将庆祝胜利与庄严纪念那些在斗争中丧生的人结合起来，或在长期的冲突后完成和平。公民节日可能会庆祝某个著名人物的生命，也可能是针对全体人民的。同样，它们可能是一个城市或地区的地方性节日，也可能是整个大陆的普遍性节日。",
	"Religious festivals may occur independently of any corresponding civic events. In some societies, the regular worship rituals of religion may be a weekly or daily occurrence, or even multiple times per day as the faithful are called to prayer by cathedral bells or the echoing calls of the priesthood. Other religions may have less structured worship routines, but nearly all commemorate the birth or death of saints or religious leaders in much the same way civic festivals celebrate secular leaders. Religious festivals, however, may also focus upon dates fixed by the dogma of the church for events beyond mortal ken, when their divine patron stepped foot upon the earth or first appeared to its acolytes in the spirit or in the flesh. Divine incarnations, interventions, apotheosis, sacrifice, resurrection, and more may be marked by the adherents of the faith with a celebration large or small.": "宗教节日可能独立于任何相应的公民活动而发生。在一些社会中，宗教的定期礼拜仪式可能每周或每天都会举行，甚至每天都会举行多次，因为信徒们被大教堂的钟声或神职人员的回声召唤去祈祷。其他宗教可能没有那么多结构化的礼拜程序，但几乎所有的宗教都会纪念圣人或宗教领袖的出生或死亡，其方式与公民节日庆祝世俗领袖的方式基本相同。然而，宗教节日也可能集中在教会教条所规定的凡人无法理解的事件的日期，即他们的神圣守护者踏上地球或首次以精神或肉体出现在其信徒面前的日期。神圣的化身、干预、神化、牺牲、复活等等都可能被信仰的信徒们用大大小小的庆祝活动来标记。",
	"There are, of course, festive occasions that may fall into either category, especially those that are tied to the seasons. Such natural markers on the calendar often gain religious significance or may be considered sacred to many faiths. Special prayers may be offered up for the planting in the spring or the harvest in the fall, while Midsummer's may be a time for worshipful offerings or blessed marriages amid summer's bounty even as Midwinter's sees vigils throughout the long dark. This is particularly true in areas where druidical faiths predominate, but the religious associations with the seasons (if any) may vary a great deal from region to region and culture to culture. In areas where no one faith is dominant, cultural attachments around seasonal holidays may be far more important to the citizenry than any particular religious celebration. A diverse city or region may see multiple overlapping holidays celebrated in many ways among the different cultures and faiths present in the area.": "当然，有一些节日可能属于这两类，特别是那些与季节有关的节日。日历上的这种自然标记往往具有宗教意义，或者可能被许多信仰认为是神圣的。仲夏节可能是为春天的播种或秋天的收获而进行的特别祈祷，而仲夏节可能是在夏天的丰收中进行崇拜的供品或祝福的婚姻的时候，即使仲冬节也会在漫长的黑暗中守夜。这在德鲁伊信仰占主导地位的地区尤其如此，但与季节有关的宗教联系（如果有的话）可能因地区和文化的不同而有很大的差异。在没有一种信仰占主导地位的地区，对公民来说，围绕季节性节日的文化联系可能比任何特定的宗教庆祝活动重要得多。一个多元化的城市或地区可能会看到多个重叠的节日在该地区不同的文化和信仰中以多种方式庆祝。",
	"Even apart from the seasons, important events may be conflated and commemorated by coincidence, just because they happen to occur on or around a known local event or existing holiday. St. Crispin's Day, a minor holiday whose lineage is somewhat unclear, nonetheless was immortalized by Shakespeare's recounting of the Battle of Agincourt in Henry V. The possibly apocryphal saints still lend their name to the 25th of October, and for that matter to the rousing \"St. Crispin's Day speech\" that Shakespeare wrote nearly 200 years after the battle, but the memory of the day has evolved to be more a celebration of the band of brotherhood between warriors.": "甚至除了季节之外，重要的事件也可能因为巧合而被混在一起纪念，只是因为它们恰好发生在一个已知的地方事件或现有的节日上或周围。圣克里斯平日是一个小节日，其来源有些不清楚，但莎士比亚在《亨利五世》中对阿金库尔战役的叙述使其不朽。可能是天书的圣人仍然把他们的名字借给10月25日，为此，莎士比亚在战役发生近200年后写下了激动人心的 \"圣克里斯平日演讲\"，但对这一天的记忆已经演变为对战士之间兄弟关系的庆祝。",
	"In roleplaying terms, the nature of the festival is not critically important, other than to provide an overall theme and to help determine what manner of ancillary events, such as tournaments or contests, might be most appropriate. If you are using the Festival Edict rules in Ultimate Rulership (5E) from Legendary Games, civic and religious festivals provide different types of bonuses to your kingdom based on the buildings available in the city where the festival takes place.": "在角色扮演方面，节日的性质并不十分重要，只是为了提供一个整体的主题，并帮助确定什么方式的辅助活动，如锦标赛或竞赛，可能是最合适的。如果你使用的是传奇游戏公司的《终极统治》（5E）中的节日诏书规则，公民和宗教节日会根据节日所在城市的可用建筑为你的王国提供不同类型的奖励。",
	"Festivals are typically held in and around a city, town, or village. However, during a festival, settlements are typically thronged with people, so unless the festival is a failure (see the Festival Edict rules in {@book Ultimate Rulership|UltRule}, reprinted in the Appendix of this book) you should treat the settlement as one size larger than its actual size for all purposes.": "节日通常是在城市、城镇或村庄及其周围举行。然而，在节日期间，居民点通常都是人山人海，所以除非节日是失败的（见本书附录中重印的{@book Ultimate Rulership|UltRule}中的节日诏书规则），否则你应该将居民点视为比其实际大小大一号的地方。",
	"In some cases, festivals may be held outside of any settlement, often near a Landmark (see Special Terrain the Kingdom-building rules in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games). In this case, the number of attendees at the festival can be highly variable, depending on how significant the festival, how often other festivals are held, the season of the year, and how far travelers typically come to attend.": "在某些情况下，节日可能会在任何定居点之外举行，通常是在地标附近（见传奇游戏公司《王国》（5E）中的《特殊地形》王国建设规则）。在这种情况下，参加节日的人数可能会有很大变化，这取决于节日的重要性、其他节日的举办频率、一年中的季节以及旅行者通常会到多远的地方去参加。",
	"Because of the high concentration of merchants and wealthy visitors (as well as black marketeers), the gp limit for buying and selling should be treated as a large city for the duration of the festival.": "由于商人和富有的游客（以及黑市商人）的高度集中，在节日期间，买卖的gp限制应被视为一个大型城市。",
	"The thronging crowds present at a typical festival do not interfere with the ability of PCs to move around the festival, but if tactical movement and line of sight are important (as during a combat encounter), there is a 50% chance that when an encounter begins at a festival the PCs will be in the midst of a crowd 20 to 80 feet in diameter. Crowds provide cover, allow Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and are considered difficult terrain for movement purposes. A DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check or DC 15 Charisma (Intimidate) check allows a PC to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction (up to 30 feet per round), as long as the PC can be seen or heard.": "在一个典型的节日里，拥挤的人群并不影响NPC在节日里的移动能力，但是如果战术移动和视线很重要的话（如在战斗中），有50%的机会，当在节日里开始遭遇时，NPC会处于直径20到80英尺的人群之中。人群提供了掩护，允许进行灵巧（隐身）检查，并被认为是移动的困难地形。通过DC12魅力（说服）检查或DC15魅力（恐吓）检查，可以说服人群向一个特定的方向移动（每轮最多30英尺），只要可以看到或听到PC。",
	"Finding a particular location in the festival grounds is a simple task to locate lesser-known merchants and locations. No roll should be necessary, especially if what is being sought is something available to the common folk. Finding information on specific people at the festival can be accomplished through Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather information, or at the GM's option with Wisdom (Insight) checks to learn about common folk and Intelligence (History) to learn about the rich and powerful. The DC should be relatively low, but feel free to use this as an opportunity to disclose information that may feed into the adventure.": "在节日的场地上寻找一个特定的位置是一个简单的任务，可以找到不太知名的商人和地点。不需要掷骰子，特别是如果所寻找的是普通人可以得到的东西。在节日中寻找特定人物的信息可以通过智力（调查）检查来收集信息，或者由GM选择用智慧（洞察力）检查来了解普通人，用智力（历史）来了解富人和权贵。测验的难度应该相对较低，但可以利用这个机会来披露可能会影响到冒险的信息。",
	"For the common folk simply attending a festival is a reward in and of itself, and low-level player characters can approach a festival the same way, as tourists and gawkers at the spectacle of it all. As PCs advance in level, however, they should see festivals as an opportunity to spread their fame across the land. They can do this by earning honor by showing mercy and gentility alongside prowess and might, gaining reputation and fame by drawing attention to themselves and their exploits, recruiting contacts and cultivating relationships, or even running a business or building up an organization.": "对于普通人来说，参加节日本身就是一种奖励，低级别的玩家角色可以以同样的方式接近节日，作为游客和目不转睛地看着这一切的景象。然而，随着NPC等级的提高，他们应该把节日看作是一个在全国范围内传播自己名声的机会。他们可以通过以下方式来实现这一目标：通过在展示能力和力量的同时表现出仁慈和温文尔雅来赢得荣誉，通过吸引人们对自己和自己的功绩的注意来获得声誉和名声，招募联系人和培养关系，甚至经营生意或建立一个组织。",
	"A tournament can serve as entertainment and an opportunity to engage in some contests and trials less dangerous than the normal adventuring life, but it also offers a great opportunity for adventurers to make an impact in the campaign world. This is doubly true if one or more of the PCs is ruling a kingdom, especially a new domain just trying to establish itself. They can put their newborn kingdom into the public eye amongst the notables and the commons alike from surrounding lands, earning prestige simply by being present for a major event. Of course, the more effort they put into promoting themselves the more prestige they can earn for themselves and their land, which will enhance their legitimacy, inducing other rulers to acknowledge them as equals and fellow rulers rather than up-jumped nobodies waiting to be picked off by their betters. This advancement in their fame and esteem is called Renown.": "锦标赛可以作为娱乐和参与一些竞赛和试炼的机会，其危险性比正常的冒险生活要小，但它也为冒险者提供了一个在活动世界中产生影响的好机会。如果一个或多个NPC正在统治一个王国，特别是一个刚刚试图建立自己的新领域，那就更是如此了。他们可以把他们的新生王国带入公众视野，在周围土地上的知名人士和普通人中间，仅仅通过出席一个重大事件就能赢得声望。当然，他们越是努力宣传自己，就能为自己和自己的土地赢得更多的声望，这将提高他们的合法性，促使其他统治者承认他们是平等的，是统治者的伙伴，而不是等待被他们的上级挑走的无名小卒。这种对他们的名声和尊敬的提升被称为 \"声誉\"。",
	"{@b Starting Renown}: PCs can take a variety of actions that earn Renown, but their baseline Renown is equal to 5 before any further adjustments.": "{@b Starting Renown}: 个人可以采取各种行动来获得荣誉，但在进一步调整之前，他们的基准荣誉等于5。",
	"{@b Keeping Up Appearances}: Whether PCs visit a festival, they may simply walk the grounds like the common folk or they may reserve a patch of the grounds for themselves and their accommodations. Even if they do not intend to stay at the festival overnight, putting up a structure displaying their ensign or flag is seen by others at the festival as a mark of their legitimacy. As a result, Renown is modified by their choice of quarters. PCs using magic to create their lodgings still must pay half of the above cost for the right to host their structure on the festival grounds. PCs may emulate a pavilion or grand pavilion with {@spell mirage arcana|phb} or similar magic, but each day they do this there is a cumulative 7% chance that they are discovered. Once the illusion is discovered, word gets around of the PCs' pretensions to glory and their Renown is reduced by 2.": "{@b Keeping Up Appearances}: 无论NPC是否参观节日，他们都可以像普通人一样在场地上行走，也可以为自己和自己的住宿保留一块场地。即使他们不打算在节日里过夜，在节日里竖起一个展示他们的旗帜的建筑物也会被其他人视为他们合法身份的标志。因此，他们的名声会因为他们选择的住所而有所改变。使用魔法来创造他们的住所的NPC仍然必须支付上述费用的一半，以获得在节日场地上搭建他们的建筑的权利。PC可以用（1%）或类似的魔法来模仿一个亭子或大亭子，但是每一天他们这样做都有累计7%的机会被发现。一旦幻觉被发现，NPC对荣耀的假装就会被传开，他们的声望会减少2。",
	"{@b Beggar's Hill} (free) PCs stand among the rabble, peeking over fences, hanging from trees, or otherwise watching from the fringes of the venue.": "{@b Beggar's Hill} (免费) PC站在乌合之众中，从栅栏上偷看，挂在树上，或以其他方式从会场的边缘观察。",
	"{@b Absence} (free) PCs may choose to simply not attend the events hosted at the arena, which may be deemed an affront to their hosts. All PCs need not attend all events, but they should send at least one representative to attend.": "{@b Absence}（免费）NPC可以选择干脆不参加竞技场举办的活动，这可能被认为是对主人的侮辱。所有的NPC不需要参加所有的活动，但他们应该至少派一名代表参加。",
	"{@b Stands} (2 gp per PC per day) PCs have a bench seat inside the arena, but far back from the action.": "{@b Stands} (每个人每天2金币) 个人在竞技场内有一个长椅，但离行动很远。",
	"{@b Box Seats} (50 gp per day) PCs have a reserved seat up front for up to 6 people, with refreshments brought to them.": "{@b Box Seats} (50 gp/day) PC在前面有一个最多可以容纳6人的预留座位，并有茶点送到他们面前。",
	"{@b Royal Box} (500 gp per day) PCs have padded seats and lavish canopies to keep off the sun or rain (often blocking the view of commoners behind them), with elaborate refreshments for up to a dozen people in a box adjacent to that of the hosts.": "{@b Royal Box} (500 gp/day) PC有软垫座椅和豪华的雨棚来遮挡阳光或雨水（经常挡住后面平民的视线），在与主人的包厢相邻的地方有精心准备的茶点，最多能容纳十几个人。",
	"{@b Commons} (free) PCs wander the festival or stay amongst the smallfolk, talking to people as they can and vying for attention with performers and hawkers.": "{@b Commons} (免费) PC在节日里闲逛，或呆在小市民中间，尽可能地与人交谈，与表演者和小贩争夺注意力。",
	"{@b Tent} (10 gp per day) PCs have a small tent or lodge for conducting private meetings or a single secure shelter.": "{@b Tent} (每天10金币) 个人有一个小帐篷或小屋，用于进行私人会议，或一个单一的安全住所。",
	"{@b Pavilion} (100 gp per day) PCs have a large tent sufficient to host a formal meeting, with table, chairs, and other furniture, or multiple secure shelters, with a corral and grooms to keep their mounts close at hand.": "{@b Pavilion} (每天100金币) 个人拥有一个足以举办正式会议的大帐篷，有桌子、椅子和其他家具，或多个安全的庇护所，有一个畜栏和马夫，使他们的坐骑近在咫尺。",
	"{@b Grand Pavilion} (1,000 gp per day) PCs have an opulent structure, which can be raised with a rod of splendor or daily use of mage's magnificent mansion. Mounts are kept in a separate adjacent structure staffed with multiple grooms.": "{@b Grand Pavilion} (1,000 gp/day) 个人拥有一个富丽堂皇的结构，可以用辉煌之棒或日常使用法师的宏伟豪宅来提升它。坐骑被饲养在邻近的独立结构中，配备有多个马夫。",
	"{@b King of the Hill}: A festival may have a particular spot reserved for celebrations, often a small hill or rise on the edge of the festival grounds, ringed in trees, for picnics and parties by day and revels by night by those wealthy folks who lack the title or privilege to claim an established pavilion. They can nonetheless attract the acclaim of errants and lesser noble scions and other untitled yet affluent folk by winning a lottery to host the celebrations for a night, wearing a crown as the King of Fools, a Crown of Holly, or a similar award. A chance in the lottery depends on the size of the festival, but is typically 1d10 x 10 gp. PCs who bid may roll a d20; on a natural 20, they win the crown and may invite any they wish to attend, but must provide music, food, and drink to all. They may provide entertainment themselves (or may hire a bard or other performer) and must provide 1d10 x 100 gp worth of food and drink, but they gain 1 point of Renown (see below) each time they win the honor.": "{@b King of the Hill}: 一个节日可能会有一个特定的庆祝地点，通常是在节日场地边缘的一个小山丘或高地，环抱着树木，供那些缺乏头衔或特权的富人在白天野餐和聚会，在晚上狂欢，以获得既定的亭子。然而，他们可以通过抽签赢得一个晚上的庆祝活动，戴上愚人王、冬青王冠或类似的奖励，来吸引移民和较小的贵族子弟以及其他无权无势的富人的赞誉。抽签的机会取决于庆典的规模，但通常是1d10 x 10 gp。参加竞标的人可以掷出一个D20；如果自然数为20，他们就赢得了王冠，并可以邀请任何他们想参加的人，但必须为所有人提供音乐、食物和饮料。他们可以自己提供娱乐（也可以雇佣吟游诗人或其他表演者），并且必须提供价值1d10 x 100 gp的食物和饮料，但他们每次赢得荣誉都会获得1点名望（见下文）。",
	"{@b Noble Boxes}: If the festival grounds have an arena for tests of skill and strength, such as jousting lists, archery ranges, racetracks, or more exotic competitions, PCs can build their repute by purchasing the rights to the best seats, nearest to the action and to the hosts of the tournament, rather than sitting with the rabble.": "{@b Noble Boxes}: 如果节日的场地上有一个测试技能和力量的竞技场，比如比武大会、射箭场、赛马场，或者更多的异国比赛，NPC可以通过购买最佳座位的权利来建立自己的声誉，这些座位离比赛现场和主持人最近，而不是和乌合之众坐在一起。",
	"{@b Making a Name and Spreading Your Fame}: In addition to simply establishing their presence with a pavilion or box seats for the grand events of the tournament, PCs can make an active effort at building the reputation of their domain. They can do this by personally entering and succeeding in contests and tournaments or hiring champions to do so on their behalf or by using their own skills and abilities. Each of the following methods requires a day of effort by one or more party members (cohorts may participate, and PCs able to make alliance with a noble patron with bards at his beck and call may be able to access their skills as well). Each effort requires the use of more than one skill; if one PC attempts to fulfill multiple skill requirements, all of their skill checks have disadvantage due to dividing their attention and efforts. If PCs succeed on all of the required skills (DC 12 each), they gain one point of Renown. If they fail one or more skill checks, they gain nothing, but if they fail all skill checks for a method by 5 or more, they lose 1 point of Renown. Each of these methods can be used more than once by repeating the effort on a subsequent day, but the DC increases by 2 each time a method is repeated.": "{@b Making a Name and Spreading Your Fame}: 除了简单地在锦标赛的盛大活动中建立自己的存在，NPC还可以积极努力地建立自己领域的声誉。他们可以通过亲自参加比赛和锦标赛并获得成功，或者雇佣冠军代表他们参加，或者利用自己的技能和能力来做到这一点。以下每种方法都需要一名或多名党员付出一天的努力（同党可以参加，而能够与有吟游诗人的贵族赞助人结盟的NPC也可以获得他们的技能）。每项努力都需要使用一个以上的技能；如果一个PC试图满足多个技能要求，他们所有的技能检查都会因为分散注意力和努力而处于劣势。如果PC在所有要求的技能上都成功了（每个技能的DC为12），他们会获得1点荣誉。如果他们有一个或多个技能检查失败，他们就没有任何收获，但如果他们对一种方法的所有技能检查都失败5次或以上，他们就会失去1点Renown。这些方法中的每一种都可以在以后的日子里通过重复努力而多次使用，但每次重复使用时，DC增加2。",
	"Success at one of these efforts can be awarded experience points as an encounter with a CR 2 lower than the party's average level.": "在这些努力中的一个成功，可以作为一个CR值比党的平均水平低2的遭遇而获得经验值。",
	"A festival has all manner of common entertainments, minstrels, mummers, singers, jugglers, tumblers, trained animals, and on and on, but much of its allure is in the glory of competition. One factor to consider in preparing to run a festival or tournament is the level of magic available in the world. In a campaign where magic is rare and mysterious like that of Tolkien, simple fortune telling and fireworks are a marvelous spectacle that the folk at the festival may remember for years to come. In a typical fantasy campaign, however, magic is far more commonplace. Even small villages may well have a hedge mage or two capable of working real magic, or a cleric, or druid tending the local shrine. Even a 1st-level sorcerer or wizard can put on an impressive display of stage magic with spells like {@spell dancing lights}, {@spell flare}, {@spell ghost sound}, and {@spell prestidigitation}, and can go well beyond that with low-level illusions like {@spell minor image} and {@spell major image}.": "一个节日有各种常见的娱乐活动，吟游诗人、哑巴、歌手、杂耍者、翻跟头者、训练有素的动物，等等，但它的大部分诱惑力在于竞争的荣耀。在准备举办节日或锦标赛时要考虑的一个因素是世界上可用的魔法的水平。在像托尔金那样魔法稀少而神秘的战役中，简单的算命和烟花是一种奇妙的景象，参加节日的人们可能会在以后的日子里记得。然而，在一个典型的幻想活动中，魔法要普遍得多。即使是小村庄，也很可能有一两个能够施展真正魔法的树篱法师，或一个牧师，或照料当地神殿的德鲁伊。即使是一级巫师或魔法师，也可以用{@spell dancing lights}、{@spell flare}、{@spell ghost sound}和{@spell prestidigitation}这样的法术来展示令人印象深刻的舞台魔法，还可以用{@spell minor image}和{@spell major image}这样的低级幻术来超越它。",
	"In addition to basic showmanship, the level of magic that exists in the campaign world on an everyday basis affects the kinds of events you include. A simple footrace in a low-magic campaign could become an exercise in super-speed or even a teleportation contest in a campaign saturated with magic power, horses replaced with pegasi and bowshots replaced with hurled lightning or psychic duels. The tone and feel of the campaign, as well as the level of the PCs, are important to consider when deciding what kinds of contests to incorporate into a festival.": "除了基本的表演技巧外，战役世界中日常存在的魔法水平也会影响到你所包括的事件种类。在一个低魔法水平的战役中，一场简单的赛跑可能会变成一场超级速度的练习，甚至在一个充满魔法力量的战役中变成一场传送比赛，马被替换成小马，弓箭被替换成投掷的闪电或精神决斗。在决定将哪种比赛纳入节日时，活动的基调和感觉，以及PC的水平，都是需要考虑的。",
	"Whatever the style of contests you employ in your festival, including having different festivals each with their own focus, they are most enjoyable for players if their characters take part, and certainly other nobles in nearby lands may encourage them to enter, or even early in their careers to ride on that leader's behalf as her or his champions. PCs not directly involved in the contest still might enjoy watching the proceedings or making wagers on them, and you may also allow players to take the role of one of the NPC contestants (perhaps ‘sponsoring' them or hiring them to compete in the name of their own land). Contestants can always yield in a contest if they wish, but such public surrender results in a loss of 1 point of Renown (see below), while winning a contest usually nets 1 point of Renown; if a contest has two different victory conditions and the same contestant wins both, that contestant wins 3 points of Renown. In addition, competing in such contests, while not generally dangerous in the same way as adventuring, still should be worth and appropriate xp award, typically as an encounter containing monsters that are roughly of a challenge rating of 1-3 levels below the PCs' own level.": "无论你在节日中采用什么风格的竞赛，包括有不同的节日，每个节日都有自己的重点，如果玩家的角色参与其中，他们就会感到最愉快，当然，附近土地上的其他贵族可能会鼓励他们参赛，甚至在他们职业生涯的早期，作为她或他的冠军，代表那个领袖骑马。没有直接参与比赛的NPC仍然可能喜欢观看比赛过程或为他们下赌注，你也可以允许玩家扮演NPC参赛者之一的角色（也许是 \"赞助 \"他们或雇用他们以自己土地的名义参赛）。如果参赛者愿意，他们总是可以在比赛中屈服，但这种公开投降的结果是损失1点声望（见下文），而赢得比赛通常会得到1点声望；如果一场比赛有两个不同的胜利条件，而同一个参赛者赢得了两个，那么这个参赛者会赢得3点声望。此外，参加这样的比赛，虽然一般来说不像冒险那样危险，但仍然应该值得并获得适当的经验奖励，通常是遭遇怪物，这些怪物的挑战等级大约比NPC自己的等级低1-3级。",
	"Display of Triumph": "胜利的展示",
	"The PCs stage a dramatic re-enactment of the PCs' adventures and accomplishments in founding their domain, establishing their status as rightful rulers.": "NPC上演了一场戏剧性的重演，讲述了NPC在建立其领地时的冒险和成就，确立了他们作为合法统治者的地位。",

	"It is not just the events themselves where magic is relevant, however. Whatever the basic magic level of the world and the tournament, player characters themselves certainly have access to magic, and so too do significant NPCs, even if the rank and file competitors and spectators do not. Since magic does exist in the game world, it is entirely plausible that some competitors will seek to use magic (or other extraordinary means) to cheat, either on their own behalf or to bias the results of events in favor of one competitor versus another. Bearing in mind that festivals and tournaments are sponsored by the wealthy, this could mean that some sponsors might use such chicanery and skullduggery to favor their own champions in the contests, but it also means that the patrons of the event have the means and wherewithal to enlist magical sentries and to have warding effects in place to prevent cheating. Of course, such supernatural sentries may not be wholly trustworthy, as they are not necessarily obliged to enforce the rules honestly and fairly equally across the board. Corrupt contest marshals might look the other way when certain competitors come to the list.": "然而，与魔法有关的不仅仅是赛事本身。无论世界和比赛的基本魔法水平如何，玩家角色本身肯定可以使用魔法，重要的NPC也是如此，即使普通的竞争对手和观众没有。由于魔法确实存在于游戏世界中，一些竞争者试图使用魔法（或其他特殊手段）来作弊是完全合理的，无论是为他们自己还是为偏袒某个竞争者的活动结果。考虑到节日和锦标赛是由富人赞助的，这可能意味着一些赞助商可能会利用这种欺骗和诡计在比赛中偏袒他们自己的冠军，但这也意味着活动的赞助人有办法和资金来招募魔法哨兵，并有防护效果来防止作弊。当然，这种超自然的哨兵可能并不完全值得信赖，因为他们不一定有义务诚实和公平地全面执行规则。当某些竞争者来到名单上时，腐败的比赛指挥员可能会睁一只眼闭一只眼。",
	"The attitudes towards cheating can be determined entirely at the GM's discretion, of course, but they also can be determined by the characteristics of the area where the festival is being held. Specifically, areas with high levels of Corruption and Crime (see the Settlement rules in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games) are likely to be tolerant of cheating, while those with high levels of Law will take a dim view of such shenanigans. However, cultural, racial, and even religious attitudes may play a role in determining the level of dishonesty likely to be encountered.": "当然，对作弊的态度可以完全由GM决定，但也可以由举办节日的地区的特点决定。具体来说，腐败和犯罪程度高的地区（见传奇游戏公司的王国（5E）中的定居规则）可能会容忍作弊，而法律程度高的地区会对这种诡计不屑一顾。然而，文化、种族、甚至宗教态度都可能在决定可能遇到的不诚实的程度上起作用。",
	"The capabilities of monitoring the competition depend on the resources of the hosts. Small local festivals may operate on the honor system out of necessity, but a festival sponsored by a king might have marshals (either in ostentatious uniforms, hidden amongst the crowd, or both) using spells like detect thoughts to check for evidence of cheating. Even in areas known for skullduggery, a host making a great show of striving for a clean competition might require competitors to use the equipment provided by the host, including clothing as well as arms and armor, to avoid them smuggling contraband items into the competition. Of course, Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used to smuggle small items in despite such surveillance.": "监督比赛的能力取决于主办方的资源。小规模的地方节日可能出于需要而采用荣誉制度，但由国王赞助的节日可能会有元帅（要么穿着浮夸的制服，要么隐藏在人群中，或者两者都有）使用侦查思想等法术来检查作弊的证据。即使是在以诡计多端著称的地区，主办方也可能要求参赛者使用主办方提供的装备，包括服装以及武器和盔甲，以避免他们将违禁品偷运到比赛中。当然，可以用灵巧（狡猾）的检查来不顾这种监视而将小物品偷运进来。",
	"While combat-focused may seem more glamorous, virtually anything can be a competition. One need look no further than county and state fairs to see the vestiges of agricultural and crafting competitions in the modern day, to say nothing of competitive cooking shows and the like on television. While these competitions may not stir the imagination of most adventurers there are some with an interest in such background skills who may wish to try their own hand or to sponsor an NPC ally or associate on toward victory.": "虽然以战斗为中心可能看起来更有魅力，但几乎任何事情都可以成为一种竞争。在现代，人们不需要再去看县和州的博览会，就能看到农业和手工艺比赛的遗迹，更不用说电视上的竞争性烹饪节目之类的。虽然这些比赛可能不会激起大多数冒险者的想象力，但也有一些对这种背景技能感兴趣的人可能希望尝试自己的手艺，或者赞助NPC盟友或同事走向胜利。",

	"{@i Winning}: Contests using a tool proficiency typically call for three skill checks, with the winner in each category based on the highest total score on all three checks. However, a prize also may be awarded for the \"Best in Show\" in each category, reflecting the highest single skill check even if that contestant's total score did not measure up. In the event of a tie, both may be awarded as Best in Show, or you may have each contestant roll 1d20 with the high roll determining the winner.": "{@i Winning}: 使用工具熟练度的竞赛通常要求进行三次技能检查，每个类别的获胜者以所有三次检查的最高总分为准。然而，每个类别的 \"最佳表现 \"也可获奖，反映出最高的单项技能检查，即使该参赛者的总分不符合要求。如果出现平局，两个人都可以获得最佳表现奖，或者你可以让每个参赛者掷出1D20，由掷出的高分决定胜负。",

	"Some contests require contestants to bring their submissions already completed and ready for the judges, while others (cooking contests in particular) may be spontaneous affairs presenting the contestants with secret or strange ingredients they must use to create delicious dishes in a very limited amount of time.

Each event provides rules to adjudicate the tournament, possible prizes for the winner (and runners-up), and complications which make the events trickier or even lethal.": "本书其他地方描述的大多数竞赛对富人和权贵举办的正式比赛和盛大活动都很有效，但有时你想要一个规模较小的节日，也许是农村的小集市或当地的夏季庆祝活动。当然，即使是小规模的比赛，你也可以使用田径比赛和射箭或投刀、投斧，但下面的活动是专门为朴实的村民和百姓之间的比赛而设计。每个事件都提供了裁决比赛的规则，为冠军（和亚军）提供可能的奖品，以及使事件更加棘手甚至致命的复杂情况。",

A contestant that rolls a natural 1 on any saving throw must immediately attempt a new save against the same DC; if this save fails, he immediately falls unconscious for 1 round, even if it is his first failed save.": "每吃一道菜都需要成功地进行体质救赎，以避免因食物带来的可怕的胃肠道不适（或立即中毒）而变得痛苦、恶心和痉挛。体质救赎的DC值为10，第一道菜之后每道菜增加2。 第一次救赎失败会导致食用者中毒一小时。第二次失败会使进食者中毒1d4分钟，第三次拯救失败会使进食者昏迷一回合。参赛者如果在任何救赎中掷出自然1，必须立即尝试新的救赎，对抗相同的DC；如果这次救赎失败，他立即昏迷1轮，即使这是他第一次救赎失败。",
	"Any class features that provide bonuses against ingested poison or against pain also apply to this save; however, the effect is not actually poison and thus spells that affect the poisoned condition, and similar effects, are of no help in enduring the pain.": "任何对摄入的毒物或疼痛提供奖励的类特性也适用于这种救赎；然而，这种效果实际上不是毒药，因此影响中毒状况的法术和类似的效果对忍受疼痛没有帮助。",
	"Tests of speed and stamina are among the oldest and simplest of all contests, and they come in a great variety of types, each one taxing the skills, endurance, and physical talents of every competitor.

	"{@b Broad Jumps}: A broad jump is a jump for maximum horizontal distance. There is a foul line that shows where the jumper must begin their jump; if they step over the line, the jump is treated as a foul and does not count. If the jumper's check results in an 8 or lower, they accidentally step over the foul line and are disqualified. In some cases, only a single jump is allowed, but in formal athletic competitions usually each contestant makes a set number of jumps (from three to six) and keeps their best result. The best overall result wins the contest, and in the case of a tie either both jumpers may be named the winners, or they may compare their second-best result or have them go to an additional jump-off. Long Jump: A long jump is a running jump. Standing Broad Jump: A broad jump is performed from a standing start. Triple Jump: A triple jump, also called a \"hop, skip, and jump\" is a combination of a single running long jump, after which the runner lands and immediately makes a second jump off one foot, and a third jump off of both feet. The third jump is treated as a standing jump with advantage. The total result of the three relevant checks gives the total distance jumped. High Jumps: A high jump is a jump for maximum vertical distance, done by jumping over a bar set at a target height, typically starting at 2 feet for standing jumps, 5 feet for running high jumps, or 10 feet for the pole vault, and all jumpers must clear this qualifying height. Jumpers who clear the height move on in the contest, while those who fail must try again. Jumpers who fail to clear three jumps (regardless of height) are disqualified. A natural 1 on a jump check to perform a high jump is an automatic failure. Once all jumpers have cleared the height or been disqualified, the bar is raised, typically half a foot at a time and the process is repeated. Confident jumpers who clear the qualifying height may pass on jumping at lower heights thereafter in order to save their attempts for later jumps. The process of raising the bar and new attempts for each remaining jumper continues at each new height, with any jumpers accumulating three failed jumps being disqualified. If at the end of all jumps at any height only one jumper left has cleared that height, they are the winner. If two or more jumpers remain, they proceed to the next height and continue the process until only one jumper remains. If neither jumper clears the new height, the jumper with the fewest failed jumps prior to the final height is the winner. If only a single jumper is left and they have not failed three jumps, they may choose to raise the bar and continue trying to clear higher heights for the sake of getting the best possible result, and the may continue trying indefinitely until they fail three jumps or until the sponsor of the contest calls for an ending.": "{@b Broad Jumps}: 宽体跳是一种最大水平距离的跳跃。有一条犯规线，显示了跳远者必须开始跳的位置；如果他们踩过了这条线，则跳远被视为犯规，不计分。如果跳远者的检查结果是8分或更低，他们就会不小心踏过犯规线，被取消资格。在某些情况下，只允许跳一次，但在正式的体育比赛中，通常每个参赛者都要跳一定数量的跳台（从三到六），并保留其最佳成绩。总成绩最好的选手赢得比赛，如果出现平局，要么两个跳远选手都被评为优胜者，要么比较他们第二好的成绩，或者让他们再进行一次跳远比赛。跳远。跳远是一种跑跳。立定跳远。跳远是以站立方式进行的。三级跳远。三级跳，也叫 \"跳、跳、跳\"，是由一次跑动中的跳远组合而成，跑者落地后立即用一只脚进行第二次跳，然后用双脚进行第三次跳。第三次跳跃被视为具有优势的站立跳跃。三个相关检查的总结果给出了总的起跳距离。跳高。跳高是为了获得最大的垂直距离，通过跳过设置在目标高度的横杆来完成，一般来说，站立跳的起点是2英尺，跑步跳高的起点是5英尺，撑杆跳的起点是10英尺，所有跳高者必须通过这个限定的高度。在比赛中，跳过这个高度的选手继续前进，而失败的选手必须再次尝试。未能通过三跳（无论高度如何）的跳水运动员将被取消资格。如果跳高检查中出现自然1，则自动失败。一旦所有跳高者都跳过了高度或被取消了资格，栏杆就会被抬高，通常每次抬高半英尺，然后再重复这一过程。自信的跳水运动员在通过资格赛的高度后，可以放弃在较低的高度跳水，以便为以后的跳水保留尝试的机会。在每一个新的高度上，都要继续提高栏杆和新的尝试，任何跳跃者累计三次失败都会被取消资格。如果在任何一个高度的所有跳跃结束时，只剩下一个跳跃者通过了该高度，他们就是胜利者。如果还有两个或更多的跳远选手，他们将进入下一个高度，继续这一过程，直到只剩下一个跳远选手。如果两个人都没有跳过新的高度，那么在最后一个高度之前，失败次数最少的跳远选手就是赢家。如果只剩下一个跳远者，而且他们没有失败过三次，他们可以选择提高标准，继续尝试清除更高的高度，以获得最好的结果，他们可以无限期地继续尝试，直到他们失败三次，或者直到比赛的赞助商要求结束。",
	"For the purpose of the contest, rather than setting a specific height you can use target DCs instead. This allows you to bypass metric conversions for jumping or worrying about the specific calculations of each height.

	"{@i Pole Vault}: A pole vault is a running high jump that uses a flexible pole to provide leverage and spring to launch the jumper higher than they could under their own power. Using a pole allows the jumper to double the result of their Acrobatics check. However, if their vault is 10 feet or higher they also must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check on the way down to avoid falling damage.": "{@i Pole Vault}: 撑杆跳是一种跑步跳高，使用一根灵活的杆子来提供杠杆和弹簧，使跳远者比他们自己的力量更高。使用杆子可以使跳远者的杂技检查结果翻倍。然而，如果他们的跳高高度是10英尺或更高，他们也必须在下降的过程中尝试DC15的灵巧（杂技）检查，以避免坠落伤害。",

	"{@b Sprint}: Each contestant in a sprint race is assumed to take the Dash action, running a short burst in a straight line. Each racer multiplies their speed by 2; this number is their base race score. In addition, the start and finish of the race are of key importance. The start is represented by an initiative check for each runner, while the ability to run through the finish without tiring is represented by a Constitution check.": "{@b Sprint}: 在短跑比赛中，每个参赛者都被认为采取了冲刺的动作，在直线上跑了一阵子。每个选手的速度乘以2；这个数字是他们的基本比赛得分。此外，比赛的起点和终点也很重要。起点是由每个选手的主动性检查来表示的，而跑过终点而不累的能力是由宪法检查来表示的。",
	"The result of these two checks is added to each runner's base race score to give a total race score. In a simple sprint, the highest total score wins.

Additional contestants with the best overall scores remaining from those who did not finish in the top two in their heat may be added to the next round as well.": "这两个检查的结果与每个选手的基本比赛得分相加，得出比赛总得分。在简单的短跑比赛中，总分最高者获胜。在大型比赛中，选手们分几轮进行比赛，每轮比赛的前两名选手进入下一轮比赛。在热身赛中未进入前两名的选手中，剩余的总分最好的选手也可进入下一轮。",

	"{@b Lap Running}: A running track is typically round, oval, or with parallel straightaways joined by curved ends. The precise shape does not matter, but the fact that runners must navigate those curves means that their speed is reduced to by 5 feet, affecting both their movement and Dash action. Each racer uses this run speed as their base race score.": "{@b Lap Running}: 跑道通常是圆形的，椭圆形的，或者是由弯曲的末端连接的平行直线。准确的形状并不重要，但跑者必须穿过这些曲线，这意味着他们的速度会降低到5英尺，影响他们的运动和冲刺动作。每个赛跑者都用这个跑步速度作为他们的基本比赛得分。",
	"Unlike a sprint race, a lap race proceeds for multiple laps, each taking approximately one minute. On the first round of the race, all racers make an initiative check and add that result to their speed. The top three race scores may choose whether to begin the race as leaders, chasers, or trailers (see below). Leaders are running as hard as they can to take and keep the lead and put distance between themselves and the runners behind them. Chasers keep together and push the pace just enough to keep the leaders within reach without opening too big of a lead. Trailers conserve their energy and follow the leaders and chasers, waiting for fatigue to eliminate their competition and to win with a strong finishing kick.": "与冲刺赛不同的是，单圈赛进行多圈，每圈大约需要一分钟。在第一轮比赛中，所有选手都要进行主动性检查，并将结果加到他们的速度上。比赛得分前三名可选择以领跑者、追赶者或拖车的身份开始比赛（见下文）。领跑者尽其所能地奔跑，以取得并保持领先，并在自己和后面的选手之间拉开距离。追赶者保持在一起，推动步伐，使领先者保持在可及的范围内，而不至于拉开太大的差距。追赶者保存体力，跟在领先者和追赶者后面，等待疲劳时消除竞争，以强有力的终结性踢腿取胜。",
	"Each turn after the first, all runners make a Constitution check, adding the result to their race score for that turn (see below). The check begins at DC 8, with the DC increasing by 1 for each round after the first for chasers and by 2 for each round after the first for leaders (the DC does not increase for trailers). The result of this check determines the multiple of their speed that serves as their race score for that turn.": "第一轮之后的每一轮，所有选手都要进行宪法检查，并将结果加入该轮的比赛得分（见下文）。检查从DC 8开始，追赶者的DC在第一轮后每轮增加1，领先者在第一轮后每轮增加2（拖车的DC不增加）。这个检查的结果决定了他们的速度的倍数，作为他们该回合的比赛得分。",

	"{@b Relays}: A relay is simply a race between teams of racers, who must pass a ring, flag, baton, or similar small object between them, or sometimes simply taps the next racer with their hand to signal the start of their course. The first runner takes the item from the start, runs their course, and then hands it to the next racer on their team (or taps them to begin), who runs their own race, and so on until each racer on the team has had one turn to race. The team with the highest total race score is the winner. However, relays are fraught with risk on the exchange, if a racer begins their stage before the previous runner has actually touched them or successfully handed off the relay item. At each exchange, the two racers must each succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check. If both runners fail the check, the exchange is botched and their team is disqualified. If one succeeds and the other fails, the exchange is made but sloppily, and the delay causes the new racer to take a penalty on their race score equal to the margin by which the save was failed (and with disadvantage on a natural 1).": "{@b Relays}: 接力赛只是各队选手之间的比赛，他们必须在彼此之间传递一个戒指、旗子、接力棒或类似的小物件，或者有时只是用手拍打下一个选手，以示开始他们的比赛。第一个选手从起点拿起物品，跑完自己的路线，然后把它交给本队的下一个选手（或拍打他们开始），后者跑自己的比赛，以此类推，直到本队的每个选手都有一次比赛机会。比赛总分最高的队伍就是赢家。然而，如果一个赛手在前一个赛手真正接触到他们或成功交出接力物品之前就开始他们的阶段，那么接力赛在交换时就充满了风险。在每次交换时，两位选手必须各自成功地进行DC 10灵巧检查。如果两位选手都没有通过检查，则交换失败，他们的队伍将被取消资格。如果一个人成功了，另一个人失败了，那么交换就完成了，但是很草率，而且延迟会导致新的选手在比赛中受到惩罚，惩罚的程度相当于挽救失败的幅度（自然1的情况下是不利的）。",
	"{@b Steeplechases}: A steeplechase is a race wherein runners must leap over several obstacles on their way through the race course. Typically, these are logs or similar wooden barriers, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to clear without incident. Each time a runner fails this check, he deducts twice the amount by which he failed the check from his final race score. If he fails the check by 5 or more, he falls prone (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw negates), and does not add anything to his racing score for that turn. If he falls, 1d3-1 other random contestants must attempt an additional Acrobatics check or be forced to stumble or even be knocked prone by the runner as he falls. While in a short sprint, a fall such as this is an automatic loss, in a longer race a runner may have time to get back up and resume running.": "{@b Steeplechases}: 障碍赛是一项比赛，选手必须在比赛过程中跃过几个障碍。通常情况下，这些障碍物是木头或类似的木头障碍物，需要成功的DC15灵巧（杂技）检查才能顺利通过。每次检查失败，他都会从他的最终比赛成绩中扣除检查失败的两倍金额。如果他的检查失败了5次或更多，他就会倒下（DC 15灵巧救赎否定），并且不会为他那一回合的比赛得分增加任何东西。如果他倒下了，1d3-1个其他的随机参赛者必须尝试额外的杂技检查，或者在他倒下时被迫绊倒，甚至被跑者撞倒。虽然在短距离冲刺中，像这样的跌倒是自动失败的，但在长时间的比赛中，选手可能有时间重新站起来继续跑。",
	"In addition to simple hurdles or barriers, many steeplechase races add additional hazards, such as a pool of water or mud on the far side of the barrier (increasing the DC by 2 or by 5 to avoid stumbling or falling). In more brutal cultures, the barriers themselves or hazards beyond them may be spiked, bladed, laced with caltrops, or otherwise made deadly dangerous, or the barriers may have actual pit traps or similar threats in front of or behind them. Such hazards are resolved as normal for traps, falling damage, etc.": "除了简单的跨栏或障碍之外，许多障碍赛还增加了额外的危险，例如在障碍的远处有一池水或泥浆（增加2或5的DC以避免绊倒或跌倒）。在更残酷的文化中，障碍物本身或障碍物之外的危险可能是带刺的、带刃的、带卡路里的，或以其他方式使其具有致命的危险，或者障碍物的前后可能有实际的坑道陷阱或类似的威胁。这种危险的解决方式与正常的陷阱、坠落伤害等一样。",
	"{@b Riding Races}: Riding races combine the abilities of mount and rider to determine a winner. They generally follow the rules for sprint and endurance races, except as described below. On the first round of the race, the rider makes an initiative check, adding the mount's initiative modifier to his own. In addition, each rider must make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, adding the result to the mount's race score during the first turn.": "{@b Riding Races}: 骑术比赛结合坐骑和骑手的能力来决定胜负。它们通常遵循短跑和耐力赛的规则，除了以下描述。在比赛的第一轮，骑手进行主动性检查，将坐骑的主动性修正值加入自己的主动性。此外，每个骑手必须进行智慧（动物处理）检查，在第一轮中把结果加到坐骑的比赛得分上。",
	"Mounts carrying a heavy load reduce their speed multiplier by 10 feet when figuring their race score in a sprint or in an endurance race. Constitution checks are made by the mount rather than the rider; however, each time the mount makes a Constitution check to determine its race score, the rider also makes a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, and the rider may use the result of either the mount's check or the rider's to determine the mount's race score for that race turn. Negative effects of a failed Constitution check, such as falling or fatigue, still apply based on the result of the Constitution check itself and cannot be negated by substituting the rider's Wisdom (Animal Handling) check in this way.": "携带重物的坐骑在计算其短跑或耐力赛的比赛成绩时，其速度乘数会减少10英尺。体质检查是由坐骑而不是骑手进行的；然而，每次坐骑进行体质检查以确定其比赛得分时，骑手也会进行智慧（动物处理）检查，并且骑手可以使用坐骑检查或骑手检查的结果来确定坐骑在该比赛回合的比赛得分。体质检查失败的负面效果，例如跌倒或疲劳，仍然基于体质检查本身的结果而适用，不能通过这种方式替代骑手的智慧（动物处理）检查而否定。",
	"{@i Mounted Steeplechases}: These races function as a normal steeplechase, but the mount must make all Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to clear the barriers along the race.

	"{@i Token Races}: Some riding races involve collecting a token during the course of the race, such as a flag or brightly colored ring or baton, which is typically suspended from a rope or otherwise is difficult to reach and must be snatched without slowing down, since the race requires a combination of speed and successfully grabbing these tokens.": "{@i Token Races}: 有些骑行比赛涉及在比赛过程中收集信物，如旗帜或颜色鲜艳的环形物或接力棒，这些信物通常被悬挂在绳子上或以其他方式难以触及，必须在不减速的情况下抢夺，因为比赛需要速度和成功抓住这些信物的组合。",
	"A spectacular version of this kind of contest is the ring race, wherein fully armored knights propel their gaily caparisoned steeds around the racecourse while they use their lances to grab beribboned rings suspended overhead whose color matches their own. Each race turn, racers can attempt an attack roll against AC 15 (or higher, for contests aimed at higher-level contestants using smaller targets more difficult to catch) to snatch a ring at full speed. Trailers in a ring race gain a +2 bonus on their attack rolls, as their measured pace helps them focus on the dancing and swinging rings overhead. If the attack roll misses by less than 5, there is a 20% chance the attacker accidentally snatches a ring of the wrong color (chosen randomly).": "这种比赛的一个壮观的版本是环形赛，全副武装的骑士推动着他们华丽的马匹在赛马场上奔跑，同时他们用长矛抓住悬挂在头顶上的颜色与自己相配的贝雷布环。每个比赛回合，参赛者可以尝试对AC15（或更高，对于针对更高级别的参赛者的比赛，使用更难捕捉的小目标）进行攻击卷，以全速抢夺一个环。擂台赛中的拖车在他们的攻击卷上获得+2的奖励，因为他们有节制的步伐可以帮助他们专注于头顶上跳舞和摆动的环。如果攻击卷的失误少于5，攻击者有20%的机会意外地抢到一个错误颜色的戒指（随机选择）。",
	"A racer who already has at least one ring on their lance who rolls a natural 1 on a subsequent attack roll or combat maneuver check must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or allow one of his rings already snatched to slip off, losing the points he would have gained from it.": "已经在他们的长矛上至少有一个戒指的赛车手，如果在随后的攻击卷或战斗动作检查中掷出自然的1，必须在DC15灵巧的救赎中成功，或者让他已经被抢走的一个戒指滑落，失去他将从它获得的点数。",

	"{@b Swimming Races}: Swim races function similarly to land-based races for creatures with a swim speed; however, for most land-dwelling creatures swimming races use the following rules. Racers make an initiative check and a Constitution check at the beginning of the race, adding them together to get their base race score, and each round they spend swimming, they add the number of feet traveled to their race score (a successful Strength (Athletics) check against a DC based on the water conditions results in moving half the character's land speed).

	"{@b Caber Tossing}: In Scottish highland games, a caber is a tapered log nearly 20 feet long and weighing 175 pounds, which must be lifted, balanced, and thrown so that the top end strikes the ground first, and ideally so that the caber falls directly away from the thrower.": "{@b Caber Tossing}: 在苏格兰高地游戏中，Caber是一根近20英尺长、重175磅的锥形木头，它必须被举起、平衡并抛出，使其上端首先撞击地面，最好是使Caber直接落在远离抛掷者的地方。",
	"The competitor must first hoist the caber up off the ground, requiring a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. Once the caber is lifted, the contestant must then balance the caber and prepare to throw it, requiring a special DC 12 ability check; the contestant makes both Strength and Dexterity checks and may select the better result. If any of these ability checks fails, the caber is dropped. Depending on the competition, a single drop may eliminate a contestant, while in other competitions contestants may be allowed a certain number of drops before being disqualified.": "参赛者必须首先将冰壶吊离地面，需要成功进行DC17力量（运动）检查。一旦卷轴被举起，参赛者必须平衡卷轴并准备投掷它，需要一个特殊的DC 12能力检查；参赛者同时进行力量和灵巧检查，并可以选择更好的结果。如果这些能力检查中有任何一项失败了，那么纸币就会掉落。根据不同的比赛，一次投掷就可以淘汰参赛者，而在其他比赛中，参赛者在被取消资格之前，可能被允许投掷一定数量。",
	"Once the caber is ready, the tosser must hurl it up in the air so that it falls top-end first, requiring a ranged attack (treat as AC 10, with disadvantage). If the attack misses, the caber fails to land top-end up and falls to the ground, scoring 0 points. To determine the direction the caber falls on a successful ranged attack, roll 1d8, with a 1 indicating the caber falls directly away from the tosser and 2-8 rotating around the target in a clockwise direction. The tosser can adjust this d8 result up or down by 1 for point by which his attack roll exceeds the target AC.": "一旦纸壶准备好了，抛掷者必须把它抛到空中，让它先从上端落下，这需要一次远程攻击（视作AC10，有劣势）。如果攻击没有命中，纸币就不能从上往下落，而是落到地上，得0分。为了确定远程攻击成功后小白兔的下落方向，请滚动1d8，1表示小白兔直接从抛掷者身边落下，2-8则以顺时针方向围绕目标旋转。投掷者可以将这个d8的结果向上或向下调整1，因为他的攻击卷超过了目标的AC。",

	"{@b Distance Throwing}: While caber tossing is a very specific event, similar tests of strength could feature large rocks or any other heavy and unwieldy item that must be lifted, balanced, and thrown at a target, and the term can be used in a universal sense to indicate other similar items for such events.": "{@b Distance Throwing}: 虽然扔纸币是一个非常具体的活动，但类似的力量测试可以以大石头或任何其他沉重和不方便的物品为特征，必须举起、平衡并扔向目标，这个术语可以在普遍意义上用于表示此类活动的其他类似物品。",
	"In addition, while distance does not matter in traditional caber tossing, hurling an object for distance is likewise a feat of strength and technique, such as the Greek shotput or discus or the modern Olympic hammer throw. For such events, each contestant makes a ranged attack roll against AC 10 with disadvantage. If the attack misses, the throw lands out of bounds and is not counted. If the attack roll hits, the thrower additionally makes a Strength check and adds the result to his attack roll to determine his score. If throwing a weaponlike object, such as a dart, javelin, or spear, the attack roll does not have disadvantage if the thrower is proficient in the weapon.": "此外，虽然在传统的投掷纸币中距离并不重要，但投掷物体的距离同样是力量和技术的壮举，比如希腊的铅球或铁饼或现代奥运会的掷锤。在这种比赛中，每个参赛者都要对AC10做一个不利的远程攻击卷。如果攻击不中，投掷物就会落在界外，不被计算在内。如果攻击卷命中，投掷者另外进行力量检查，并将结果加入他的攻击卷中以确定他的得分。如果投掷类似武器的物体，例如飞镖，标枪，或者长矛，如果投掷者精通该武器，那么攻击卷不会有劣势。",

Each anchor makes their checks, applying any modifiers for their team, and compare the result.

After that point, each competitor must increase the weight after each successful lift by at least 10 pounds, though they may choose to increase the weight of their lift if desired. If they fail a lift, they can retry the same weight. Lifters continue increasing their weight as many times as desired until they fail a total of three lifts, at which point the highest weight they successfully lifted stands.": "一场比赛通常以最低资格重量开始（通常至少150磅）；未能举起该重量的人不能参赛。在这之后，每位参赛者在每次成功举起后必须增加至少10磅的重量，不过他们可以根据需要选择增加举起的重量。如果他们举重失败，他们可以重试相同的重量。举重选手继续增加重量，次数不限，直到他们总共举起三次失败，此时他们成功举起的最高重量就成立。",

	"{@i Knockout}: If either competitor is rendered unconscious by the reducing their opponent to 0 hit points, he is knocked out and his opponent is declared the winner. If a fighter confirms a critical hit during a boxing match, the target must make a Constitution saving throw equal to 10 + the damage dealt or gain a level of exhaustion, or two exhaustion levels if they fail the save by 5 or more. Rolling a natural 1 on this save renders the target unconscious. Any exhaustion levels gained in this way are removed when the afflicted boxer finishes a long rest.": "{@i Knockout}: 如果任何一位参赛者因将对手的命中率降至0而失去意识，他就会被击倒，他的对手被宣布为胜利者。如果拳手在拳击比赛中确认了关键一击，目标必须做一个相当于10+所受伤害的宪法救赎，或者获得一个等级的疲惫，或者如果他们的救赎失败5或更多，则获得两个疲惫等级。在这个救赎中掷出一个自然的1，会使目标失去知觉。以这种方式获得的任何疲惫等级会在受影响的拳击手完成长时间休息后被移除。",
	"{@i Rounds}: A boxing match can last any number of rounds agreed upon by the contestants, though usually a minimum of 3 rounds and a maximum of 15. These rounds can be literal combat rounds, or they can be any length stipulated by the combatants, though rarely longer than 1 minute.": "{@i Rounds}: 一场拳击比赛可以持续到参赛者同意的任何数量的回合，但通常最少3个回合，最多15个回合。这些回合可以是字面上的战斗回合，也可以是战斗人员规定的任何长度，但很少超过1分钟。",
	"{@i Scoring}: If neither opponent is knocked unconscious during the duration of the fight, the victor is determined by a scoring system. Each competitor tallies one point per hit and two points for each critical hit. In any round in which a fighter scores more hits than his opponent, he gains one additional bonus point. A fighter can use a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) contest to appear to land more punches than he actually does; this contest is opposed by the passive Perception of the judge(s) scoring the match, and the check is made each round. Both the fighter and the judge(s) add their proficiency bonus to these checks even if they lack proficiency in the appropriate skill as long as they are proficient with unarmed strikes. If a fighter's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check exceeds the Wisdom (Perception) check of the judge(s), he is treated as if he scored 1 additional hit during that round, plus one additional hit for every 5 points by which his check exceeded the judge's highest Wisdom (Perception) check.": "{@i Scoring}: 如果在战斗过程中双方都没有被击倒，则由评分系统决定胜负。每位参赛者每击中一次计1分，每击中一次要害计2分。在任何一个回合中，如果一个战士比他的对手获得更多的命中，他将获得一个额外的奖励点。拳手可以使用灵巧（诡计多端）的比赛，使自己看起来比实际打出更多的拳头；这种比赛是由为比赛评分的裁判的被动感知力来反对的，而且每轮都要进行检查。拳手和裁判都会在这些检查中加入他们的熟练度加成，即使他们缺乏对相应技能的熟练度，只要他们精通徒手打击。如果一个战士的灵巧（灵巧）检查超过了裁判的智慧（感知）检查，他将被视为在该回合中获得了1次额外的命中，另外，他的检查每超过裁判的最高智慧（感知）检查5分，就有一次额外的命中。",

	"{@i Clinch}: One boxer grabs onto another as a defensive maneuver to prevent his opponent from landing effective punches. Treat this as a grapple contest. If the target's opposed roll is 5 or more points lower than the grappler, the target is has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of next turn. A referee will usually end the grapple after 1 turn.": "{@i Clinch}: 一名拳击手抓住另一名拳击手作为防守手段，以防止他的对手打出有效的拳头。将此视为一场抓斗比赛。如果目标的反对卷比抓捕者低5分或更多，则目标在攻击卷上有劣势，直到下一回合结束。裁判员通常会在一回合后结束抓斗。",

	"{@i Jab}: This is a standard unarmed strike.": "{@i Jab}: 这是一个标准的徒手攻击。",
	"{@i Low Blow}: A blow below the belt is generally considered against the rules, much like a head butt, and in such cases making a low blow without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the passive Perception checks of the judges as described previously. If noticed, a successful low blow does not score a point and results in a 1-point penalty to the attacker. A successful hit with a low blow deals an additional 1d3 points of damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion that goes away after the target finishes a short rest.": "{@i Low Blow}: 腰部以下的打击通常被认为是违反规则的，就像头部撞击一样，在这种情况下，在不被注意的情况下进行低位打击，需要成功的灵巧（灵巧）检查，由裁判的被动感知检查来争夺，如前面所述。如果被注意到，成功的低击不得分，并导致攻击者被罚1分。一个成功的低空打击会造成额外的1d3点伤害。此外，目标必须做一个DC 8的宪法救赎动作，或者获得一个级别的疲惫，这个疲惫在目标完成短暂的休息后会消失。",
	"{@b Wrestling}: Wrestling is a contest of combat maneuvers, especially (but not exclusively) the grapple contest. Shove contests are used to take a foe to the ground and make them easier to pin, while in other forms of wrestling such as sumo the object is to force the opponent out of the ring. Matches can be simple submission contests, wherein the match continues until one wrestler is subdued through maintaining a grapple for a certain number of rounds. Wrestling matches typically occur in a 15-foot diameter ring (which may be round or square), though larger rings may be use for tag team or group wrestling matches. The rules below present a formalized scoring system that can be used to reward specific maneuvers and outcomes.": "{@b Wrestling}: 摔跤是一种战斗技巧的比赛，特别是（但不限于）擒拿比赛。摔跤比赛是用来把敌人按在地上，使他们更容易被钉住，而在其他形式的摔跤中，如相扑，目的是把对手逼出擂台。比赛可以是简单的屈服比赛，即比赛继续进行，直到一个摔跤手通过保持一定数量的抓握被制服。摔跤比赛通常发生在一个直径15英尺的擂台上（可以是圆形或方形），尽管更大的擂台可以用于标记团队或团体摔跤比赛。下面的规则提出了一个正式的计分系统，可以用来奖励特定的动作和结果。",
	"{@i Duration}: A wrestling match usually lasts a set number of rounds (usually 10, 12, or 15), though the match can end early if one wrestler maintains a grapple for 3 rounds. If neither wrestler can maintain, the match is decided on total points. If the score is tied at the end of the set duration, the match continues in a sudden death format, where the first wrestler to outscore his opponent in a round wins the match.": "{@i Duration}: 摔跤比赛通常持续一定数量的回合（通常为10、12或15），但如果一个摔跤手保持3个回合的抓握，比赛可以提前结束。如果两个摔跤手都不能保持，比赛将根据总分决定。如果在设定的持续时间结束时分数相同，比赛将以突然死亡的形式继续进行，即在一个回合中第一个超过对手的摔跤手赢得比赛。",
	"{@i Exhaustion}: Wrestling matches take a considerable amount of energy. A wrestler can wrestle for a number of rounds equal to one-half his Constitution score before risking exhaustion. After this time, each wrestler must succeed at a DC 10 Constitution check or gain an exhaustion level at the end of each round. The DC increases by 1 for each round thereafter. When a wrestler gains an exhaustion level, the DC resets to 10 but additional checks must be made each round to avoid gaining further levels. A wrestler using a Dodge action does not need to make a Constitution check that round and reduces the DC of subsequent checks by 1. Exhaustion levels gained are never lethal and are removed after a short rest.": "{@i Exhaustion}: 摔跤比赛需要相当多的能量。摔跤手在冒着筋疲力尽的危险之前，可以摔跤的回合数等于他体质得分的二分之一。在这之后，每个摔跤手必须在DC10宪法检查中取得成功，否则在每轮结束时获得一个疲惫等级。此后的每一回合，DC增加1。当摔跤手获得一个疲惫等级时，DC重置为10，但每轮必须进行额外的检查以避免获得更多等级。使用闪避动作的摔跤手不需要在该回合进行体质检查，并将后续检查的DC减少1。所获得的疲惫等级永远不会致命，并在短暂的休息后消除。",
	"{@i Give and Take}: Scoring occurs at the end of each round of a wrestling match. A grapple that is not maintained to the end of the opponent's turn scores no points.": "{@i Give and Take}: 计分发生在摔跤比赛的每个回合结束时。没有维持到对手回合结束的抓斗不得分。",
	"{@i Showboating}: Wrestling bouts can be simple athletic endeavors, or they can be grand spectacles with casts of colorful costumed characters with outlandish names and costumes to match, from masked luchadors or gloriously spangled and sequined performers with catchphrases, capes, props, and bombastic entrance music. These endeavors may still be highly athletic (though in some cases they may follow a prearranged script as to who wins or loses a match), but a Charisma (Athletics) check can be made in place of a Strength (Athletics) check.": "{@i Showboating}: 摔跤比赛可以是简单的运动项目，也可以是盛大的场面，由色彩斑斓的人物组成，他们的名字和服装都很怪异，有戴面具的斗牛士，也有光鲜亮丽的表演者，还有口头禅、斗篷、道具和轰鸣的入场音乐。这些努力可能仍然是高度运动性的（尽管在某些情况下，他们可能遵循预先安排好的比赛输赢的剧本），但可以用魅力（运动）检查来代替力量（运动）检查。",
	"{@i Tag Team}: This style of wrestling pits two teams against each other, though only one wrestler from each team is on the mat at a time. At any time during the match, a wrestler can tag their partner and then exit the ring, while their partner enters the fray in their place. The partner outside the ring must stay in a specific location and cannot move around the ring to get closer to their partner.": "{@i Tag Team}: 这种风格的摔跤让两队对决，但每队每次只有一个摔跤手在垫子上。在比赛的任何时候，一个摔跤手可以标记他们的伙伴，然后退出擂台，而他们的伙伴则代替他们进入战场。擂台外的搭档必须呆在一个特定的位置，不能在擂台上移动以接近他们的搭档。",
	"{@i Team Wrestling}: Some wrestling matches pit evenly matched teams against one another, with all wrestlers in the match at once. Scoring proceeds as described below, and wrestlers may choose to combine their efforts to pin and hold one of their opponents or may engage in multiple one-on-one grapples simultaneously. A wrestler who is grappled and held for three rounds is out of the match and the bout continues until all of one team's wrestlers have been eliminated, or based on the aggregate score for each team if both teams still have wrestlers remaining at the end of the match. Any successful point-scoring move by a wrestler counts toward the aggregate total for their team.": "{@i Team Wrestling}: 有些摔跤比赛是由势均力敌的队伍对阵，所有摔跤手同时参加比赛。计分过程如下所述，摔跤手可以选择合力夹住一个对手，也可以同时进行多个一对一的擒拿。被擒抱的摔跤手在三个回合内出局，比赛继续进行，直到一队的所有摔跤手都被淘汰，如果两队在比赛结束时仍有摔跤手，则以每队的总分为准。摔跤手的任何成功计分动作都计入本队的总分。",
	"{@i Unsportsmanlike Conduct}: In a wrestling match, you often can escape the view of any judges or referees, and dirty tricks can be used to put an opponent in a compromising position and gain advantage. Using an illegal hold or an unsportsmanlike maneuver such as an eye gouge, groin grab, strike with a closed fist, and so on without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check opposed by the passive Perception checks of the judges and your opponent. This is a bonus action, and you may choose one of the following options:": "{@i Unsportsmanlike Conduct}: 在摔跤比赛中，你经常可以躲过任何裁判员的视线，肮脏的伎俩可以用来将对手置于不利的位置并获得优势。在不被注意的情况下使用非法的抱摔或不符合体育精神的动作，如挖眼、抓腹股沟、用闭合的拳头击打等等，需要成功的灵巧（灵巧）检查，并与裁判和你的对手的被动感知检查相对立。这是一个额外动作，你可以选择以下选项之一。",

	"If the dirty trick is noticed, the wrestler receives a warning and his opponent gains 1 point. A second dirty trick that is noticed results in the wrestler being disqualified.": "如果肮脏的把戏被注意到，摔跤手会受到警告，他的对手会得到1分。第二次被发现的阴招将导致该摔跤手被取消资格。",
	"Because of the chaos and confusion of a match with multiple wrestlers on a side, Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver without being noticed have advantage in a team wrestling match.": "由于一方有多个摔跤手的比赛的混乱，在团队摔跤比赛中，通过灵巧（灵巧）的检查，在不被发现的情况下进行肮脏的战斗动作是有优势的。",

This also can be accomplished with a grapple when you force the opponent to move.": "@b相扑}。相扑和类似形式的摔跤并不依靠抓住对手，而是通过推搡比赛将对手逼到地上或摔出场外。当你迫使对手移动时，这也可以通过抓斗来完成。",
	"Both wrestlers begin near the center of a 15- or 20foot ring, and must force their opponent back or to the side 10 feet to force them out of the ring, or knock them prone. Both wrestlers begin from a set position marked within the ring and roll initiative at the beginning of the match. In some cultures, the rules of sumo are considered sacred, and any unsportsmanlike conduct noticed by the judges is grounds for immediate disqualification and forfeit of the match. If you use a 15-foot ring, assume both wrestlers begin in the center square; if you wish a bit more movement opportunity using a standard grid of 5-foot squares, a 20-foot ring may work better.": "双方摔跤手从15或20英尺的擂台中心附近开始，必须将对手逼退或逼到10英尺之外，将其逼出擂台，或将其击倒在地。双方摔跤手都从圈内标记的固定位置开始，并在比赛开始时进行主动滚动。在一些文化中，相扑的规则被认为是神圣的，任何被裁判注意到的不符合体育道德的行为都会被立即取消资格并被罚下场。如果你使用15英尺的擂台，假设两个摔跤手都从中间的方格开始；如果你希望使用5英尺的标准方格有更多的运动机会，20英尺的擂台可能效果更好。",
	"In the case of a shove contest, the winner can move both his opponent and himself 5 feet. If the opponent's contested check is 5 points or more lower than the attacker, they are knocked prone and lose that match.": "在推搡竞赛的情况下，获胜者可以将对手和自己都移动5英尺。如果对手的争夺检查比攻击者低5分或更多，他们就会被打倒在地，并输掉该场比赛。",

	"{@b Scoring}: A sumo contest typically consists of a set number of matches, either within the same day or over a span of days. In a single contest, two wrestlers might have five matches, with the winner determined by whomever wins the most individual matches. Tradition dictates that all matches in the set are completed, even if one wrestler has an insurmountable advantage in that set, both for the loser to demonstrate stoic aplomb in defeat and to determine total number of matches won if the sumo event stretches over multiple days and involves multiple wrestlers, as the winner of the highest aggregate total number of matches at the end of the event is the grand champion of that event.": "{@b Scoring}: 相扑比赛通常由一定数量的比赛组成，可以在同一天内进行，也可以在数天内进行。在一次比赛中，两名摔跤手可能有五场比赛，由谁赢得最多个人比赛决定胜负。传统规定，所有的比赛都要完成，即使一个摔跤手在该组比赛中具有不可逾越的优势，这既是为了让失败者在失败中表现出谦逊的风度，也是为了在相扑比赛持续多天、涉及多名摔跤手的情况下确定赢得的总场次，因为在比赛结束时总场次最多的赢家是该赛事的总冠军。",
	"While the preceding section details a broad array of familiar contests from real-world history and culture, this is a fantasy game and it's eminently possible in a higher-magic campaign, or one that features higher-level characters, to dial up the difficulty and complexity of your tournament events.

This is true even if another contestant has charged the majority of the energy into the pillar; it is the contestant who pushes the pillar beyond 100 radiant or necrotic hit points that captures it (this includes creatures summoned by a contestant). Captured pillars become amazingly durable (AC 18, Damage Threshold 8, 180 hit points).": "每位参赛者都会得到一块彩色令牌，当他们使石柱达到100点正值或100点负值时，他们就会 \"捕获 \"该石柱，因为它完全变成白色（辐射）或黑色（坏死），安装在石柱顶部的水晶球也会发出他们的颜色的亮光。即使另一位参赛者将大部分能量注入石柱也是如此；只有将石柱推到超过100个辐射或坏死命中率的参赛者才能捕获它（这包括由参赛者召唤的生物）。被俘虏的柱子会变得惊人地持久（AC18，伤害阈值8，180点命中率）。",

Faceless and nameless \"black knights\" throughout the years have sought titles of achievement and honor in the tourneys while keeping their identity a secret, or have hidden their past shame beneath a mask or hood while they sought to repair their honor. Most trueborn and honorable knights avoid confrontations with them for fear of besmirching their own reputation by losing to an opponent of no repute (with little renown to be gained even in victory), and such knights typically have no recourse to compel their challenge to be answered. However, for decades knights who have refused challenges from nameless foes have been found murdered, their bodies battered, charred, and mutilated, with scarcely a trace found of their killers but a crude, sooty black mask drawn in the dirt.

Not content to lure mortals of good heart to their doom through the typical sin of lust, she devised a rare plan to play upon pride and wrath, seeking out those paragons of goodness and mercy who sought to rise in public esteem and to be inspirations to the people at large. Her bestial son would instead seek them out in the guise of a common steed, or recruit a rider for himself willing to help take down the proud and the mighty, humiliating them on the field before slaughtering them once their fame and renown had been destroyed.

He attempts to lure the target into riding him, replacing grooms and valets with his own minions or intimidating others into sending PCs his way, making excuses about why other horses cannot be used in the list.

In addition, the PCs' kingdom gains the following political benefits based on their final Renown. Each level of renown includes the benefits of all levels that precede it. If your tournament is large, with many events, you might choose to increase the Renown required to earn each of the following levels of fame and esteem. Losing large amounts of renown may cause your followers and cohort to leave you, or at the very least to become disgruntled.": "一旦比武结束，就可以将党派的声望加总。该团体可以招募追随者为他们的领地服务，他们将担任管家、城堡管理员、战争队长、高级法官、主教、宫廷法师、宫廷吟游诗人或类似的重要角色。这些人效忠于整个领地--而不是单一的PC--尽管他们听从任何一个PC的指挥，以保持玩家所决定的等级制度。这些追随者的挑战等级不能超过2，尽管他们中的90%会是挑战等级1/2或0。一个拥有至少1点声望的团体还可以获得一个特殊的同族追随者，该追随者可以是一个挑战等级比团体平均水平低2点的NPC。这些追随者和同伙不需要招募，他们会立即从节日的人群中站出来宣誓效忠。此外，NPC的王国会根据他们的最终声望获得以下政治利益。每个级别的声望都包括之前所有级别的好处。如果你的锦标赛规模很大，有很多活动，你可以选择增加获得以下每个级别的名声和尊敬所需的声望。失去大量的声望可能会导致你的追随者和同伙离开你，或者至少变得不满意。",
	"If the PCs are simple adventurers with no direct connection to a kingdom of their own or anyone else's, they may compete in tournaments for fun of it, or to win prizes of money, magic, or special favors from the sponsors of the tournament. Monetary prizes are listed for some events above, but unless otherwise noted should be commensurate to the risk involved and the treasure for an encounter with a foe of a challenge rating appropriate to the challenge of each event.

You can invest any amount of BP (up to a maximum equal to your Renown) in this trade route, as if you had used a Trade Edict to establish the route, but the route is created immediately and grants you a +1 bonus to Economy for one year and increases your treasury by a number of BP equal to the trade route's route modifier (RM) plus 2d4 BP for every 5 BP you invested.

This functions as a military unit owned by the PCs' kingdom for as long as the alliance lasts, but they do not need to pay upkeep or maintenance costs, as they are paid by their ally. Accepting the army requires the PCs to make a successful Loyalty check each month to avoid generating 1 point of Unrest; if they make three consecutive successful checks, their citizens accept the presence of the allied army and no further checks are required.

	"A Festival Edict is a special edict distinct from the broader Holiday Edict. Whereas a Holiday Edict declares days to celebrate on the calendar across the length and breadth of your kingdom, a Festival Edict is a specific, onetime event (though it could be repeated later) focused in a particular place at a particular time for a particular purpose. A Festival may be called for any reason or for no reason at all and include tournaments, games, music, dancing, feasting, drinking, parades, fireworks or magical displays, and similar entertainments of all kinds, but each one undertaken with special magnificence. Festival Edicts bring great crowds of people together to celebrate and are normally held in the same hex as a settlement, to facilitate easy access for crowds to reach the festival grounds. Festivals can, however, be hosted at any Landmark special terrain. Festivals may be either civic or religious in nature. Cost: Festivals require a great deal of resources to pull off. A festival costs 1d2 BP if held at a Landmark in the countryside, 1d4 BP if held in a village, 1d8 BP if held in a town, and 2d6 BP per city district if held in a city.

PCs not directly involved in the contest still might enjoy watching the proceedings or making wagers on them, and you may also allow players to take the role of one of the NPC contestants (perhaps 'sponsoring' them or hiring them to compete in the name of their own land). Contestants can always yield in a contest if they wish, but such public surrender results in a loss of 1 point of Renown (see below), while winning a contest usually nets 1 point of Renown; if a contest has two different victory conditions and the same contestant wins both, that contestant wins 3 points of Renown.
