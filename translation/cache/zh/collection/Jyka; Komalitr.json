Haruspices are influencers of fate, magic and the arcane. The cards they draw influence the world, and can give or take the powers of those around them.": "Haruspices在一些人眼里被称为 \"算命的\"，在许多人眼里被称为 \"骗子\"，然而很少有人真正了解卡片背后的魔法。Haruspices是命运、魔法和神秘的影响者。他们抽出的牌影响着世界，并能赋予或夺取他们周围人的力量。",
	"What may seem a simple card to an observer may be a burden on the target, cursed to suffer its effects. The reversed tarot are a dangerous tool when in the hands of a haruspex.": "在观察者看来简单的牌，对目标来说可能是个负担，被诅咒要承受其影响。颠倒的塔罗牌在骚扰者手中是一个危险的工具。",
	"The same can be said for an upright card pulled by a haruspex. it can mimic the blessing of a god, if only for a limited time. ": "由哈鲁斯佩克拉出的直立牌也可以这么说。它可以模仿神的祝福，即使只是在有限的时间内。",
	"The energy found within a haruspex's cards mimic the presence of a holy symbol of a Cleric, or a royal amulet of a noble, both in power and recognition.": "在哈鲁斯佩克的牌中发现的能量，在力量和认可度上都模仿教士的神圣符号，或贵族的皇家护身符。",
	"Depending on the city, government or individual, a haruspex might be praised, humiliated or hunted. Their magic is often seen akin to that of a warlock, though they do not inherently cast any spells.": "根据不同的城市、政府或个人，哈鲁斯佩克可能会被赞扬、羞辱或被追杀。他们的魔法经常被视为类似于术士的魔法，尽管他们本身并不施放任何法术。",
	"The power of the haruspex can be compared to the inherited magic of a Sorcerer, but also the pact-born magic of a Warlock. Though it is not fully certain where it first began, most haruspices are taught the tarot-based magic by a close relative or mentor. Cases have been found where ordinary men and women are blessed by a God or Goddess and develop the abilities of a haruspex, though it is a rare occurance.": "哈鲁斯派斯的力量可以与巫师的继承性魔法相比，也可以与术士的契约性魔法相比。虽然不能完全确定它最初始于何处，但大多数哈鲁斯派斯都是由近亲或导师教授基于塔罗牌的魔法。也有一些案例显示，普通人受到上帝或女神的祝福而发展出哈鲁斯派斯的能力，但这是一种罕见的情况。",

	"Haruspicees rarely serve common folk, with the exception of predicting the future of a city or town for mass influence. The power that a haruspex holds is fueled by the belief others place in them. Haruspices travelling in a party often benefit from having good relations with their fellow travellers.": "Haruspicees很少为普通人服务，除了预测一个城市或城镇的未来以获得大众影响。一个哈鲁斯派斯所拥有的力量是由其他人对他们的信任所推动的。与同伴一起旅行的哈鲁斯派斯往往会因为与同伴的良好关系而受益。",
	"A haruspex can see into the future, if only a short while. The act of them doing so is said to be quite exhausting. As such, many simply refuse to do so unless paid generously. This metaphysical 'eye' can take physical form on the haruspex, normally conforming to their personality, race and self-image. ": "哈鲁斯佩克可以看到未来，即使只是很短的时间。据说他们这样做的行为是相当累人的。因此，许多人干脆拒绝这样做，除非得到慷慨的报酬。这种形而上的 \"眼睛 \"可以在哈鲁斯佩克身上形成实体，通常与他们的个性、种族和自我形象相一致。",
	"For example, common forms include a third eye, a halo above the head, or additional non-physical limbs around the body, similar to an astral form.": "例如，常见的形式包括第三只眼、头顶上的光环，或身体周围有额外的非物理性肢体，类似于星体的形式。",
	"Haruspices train rigorously to be able to use Future Sight, with some falling to the strain of future sight during their training.": "哈鲁斯派斯为了能够使用未来之眼而进行严格的训练，有些人在训练期间倒在了未来之眼的压力之下。",
	"When you create a haruspex, the first thing you want to consider is their past. Were they a performer in a circus? Perhaps a fortune-teller in a big city? Or were they a royal family's future sight?": "当你创造一个haruspex时，你要考虑的第一件事就是他们的过去。他们是马戏团的表演者吗？也许是大城市里的算命师？或者他们是一个皇室的未来视线？",
	"Once you have chosen their past, you can begin to think about their future. What path will they follow as they strive for greatness? Or is it the opposite? Do they only wish to be alone?": "一旦你选择了他们的过去，你就可以开始考虑他们的未来。在他们争取伟大的过程中，他们将走什么样的道路？还是相反？他们是否只希望孤独？",
	"You can make a haruspex quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the entertainer background.": "遵循这些建议，你可以很快做出一个哈鲁斯佩克。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力分数，其次是智慧。第二，选择艺人背景。",
	"If you wish to focus on using a haruspex's card effects, focus on Charisma. If you wish to focus on spellcasting, focus on Wisdom.": "如果你想专注于使用哈鲁斯佩克的卡牌效果，请专注于魅力。如果你想专注于施法，就专注于智慧。",

See what happens when you spend a point from each respective pool below.": "使用精神点是一个奖励行动，无论你从哪个池子里使用它。从每个不同的池子中使用精神点都有不同的效果。白池的效果是治疗，黑池的效果是伤害，而红池的效果是提升你的盟友或你的召唤物，一旦它们对你可用。看看当你从下面的每个池子里花费一个点时会发生什么。",
