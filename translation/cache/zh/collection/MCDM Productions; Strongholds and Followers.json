	"As master of discipline, Oregg's favorite way to get an orc to behave or torture prisoners is to lock them in their own armor and cast heat metal to sear their flesh. He has practiced this spell for years, bartering with the druids of other orc tribes to unlock its magical secrets.": "作为纪律大师，奥雷格最喜欢让兽人听话或折磨囚犯的方法是把他们锁在自己的盔甲里，并施放热金属来灼烧他们的肉体。他多年来一直在练习这个法术，与其他兽人部落的德鲁伊进行交易，以解开其神奇的秘密。",

	"The character so crowned feels a rush of divine power, a tiny fraction of the same energy all the Celestial Court are made of. Apart from the blazing crown over their head, their new power manifests as beams of light shooting from their eyes, their skin flashing to gold in an instant, or their hair turning to blazing, heatless fire. Upon losing the crown, they feel a period of melancholy as their previous greatness flees, leaving them mortal, again, and lesser.": "被加冕的人物会感受到一股神圣的力量，这是所有天庭的能量中的一小部分。除了头上那顶炽热的王冠外，他们的新力量还表现为从他们的眼睛中射出的光束，他们的皮肤在瞬间闪耀成金色，或者他们的头发变成了炽热的、没有温度的火焰。在失去王冠后，他们会感到一阵忧郁，因为他们以前的伟大之处消失了，让他们再次成为凡人，变得更弱。",

	"The Crown prevents any attempt to force its wearer to behave in any way contrary to their will, so the Princip tends to Crown the character most likely to fail a Wisdom saving throw. The wearer of the Crown chooses which ability they want to raise, but raising Wisdom while wearing the Crown isn't the best use, as you're already basically immune to charm person and other mind-dominating spells. That is, unless you use Wisdom for spellcasting, in which case 24 Wisdom is going to rock your enemies for however long it lasts.": "王冠能阻止任何试图强迫佩戴者以任何违背其意愿的方式行事的行为，因此公爵倾向于将最有可能在智慧救赎中失败的角色加冕。皇冠的佩戴者可以选择他们想要提高的能力，但在佩戴皇冠时提高智慧并不是最好的用途，因为你已经基本上对魅惑者和其他支配心灵的法术免疫了。也就是说，除非你用智慧来施法，在这种情况下，24的智慧会让你的敌人震撼不已，无论它持续多久。",
	"Raising Constitution to 24 means you're probably not going to lose the Crown when you take damage. And you'll gain a bunch of hit points, making you less likely to die.

So it's a choice between surviving longer and doing your thing better.": "将体质提高到24意味着你在受到伤害时可能不会失去王冠。而且你会获得一堆命中率，使你不那么容易死亡。但24是如此之高（+7！），以至于你甚至可以提高你的最佳能力，并在你做的任何事情上更加出色。因此，这是在生存时间更长和做得更好之间的一个选择。",
	"Once someone is Crowned, the Princip enjoys wading into battle and smashing things with its scepter. Like all the Court, the Princip prefers to smash evil over neutral monsters, but it tends to try to defend the character it Crowned, even over the character who summoned it. However, if it thinks the Crowned character is now so powerful it doesn't need help, it defaults to the character who summoned it (if they're different people). If neither its summoner or the Crowned needs help, the Princip defends the most vulnerable party member.": "一旦有人被加冕，公爵就喜欢涉足战斗，用它的权杖砸碎东西。像所有的法庭一样，普林斯比起中立的怪物，更喜欢粉碎邪恶的怪物，但它倾向于保护被它加冕的角色，甚至比召唤它的角色更努力。然而，如果它认为被加冕的角色现在非常强大，不需要帮助，它就会默认召唤它的角色（如果他们是不同的人）。如果它的召唤者和被加冕者都不需要帮助，普林斯就会保护最脆弱的一方成员。",
	"While one character is enjoying the benefits of temporary godhood, the Princip dispenses other buffs to the party in an attempt to turn the tide of battle. Which, wow, it's gonna do that. It can cast haste three times, which is enough to make a huge difference on its own. Or stoneskin for anyone who's getting hammered in combat, and remove curse in case the party was in trouble when it arrived.": "当一个角色享受着临时神的好处时，公爵向党派派发了其他BUFF，试图扭转战局。哇，它能做到这一点。它可以施放三次哈斯特，这足以让它自己产生巨大的变化。或者为那些在战斗中受到打击的人施放石皮，以及消除诅咒，以防在它到达时队伍陷入困境。",
	"If the battle lasts long enough, or if the Princip is summoned again after using its daily spells, it hands out shield of faith and enhance ability to the PCs, giving each of them a little pep talk in its own bizarre fashion. The Princip enjoys proclaiming the heroes' greatness a lot, speaking in flowery prose that doesn't make literal sense but conveys the idea that it thinks the heroes are literally glorious.": "如果战斗持续的时间足够长，或者如果普林西比在使用了它的日常法术后再次被召唤出来，它就会向NPC发放信仰之盾和增强能力，以它自己的怪异方式给他们每个人讲点鼓舞人心的话。公爵很喜欢宣扬英雄们的伟大，用花哨的散文说话，虽然没有字面意义，但却传达了它认为英雄们真的很光荣的想法。",

	"Pretty much what you'd expect from an angelic being called an Authority. It is the knight of the Celestial Court. What paladins would like to be when they grow up. The Authority arrives on our plane in heavy armor, armed with the Brightsword and looking for evil to smash. It is responsible for maintaining celestial order, and while it's still absolutely committed to smashing evil, it tends to smash chaotic evil a little more than other evils.": "与你所期望的差不多，一个被称为当局的天使存在。它是天庭的骑士。圣骑士们长大后都想成为这样的人。权威者穿着厚重的盔甲来到我们的星球，以光明剑为武器，寻找可以击碎的邪恶。它负责维护天庭的秩序，虽然它仍然绝对致力于粉碎邪恶，但它倾向于粉碎混乱的邪恶，比其他邪恶更多一点。",
	"The Authority sometimes appears spontaneously in times when a good king or democratic civilization is facing an existential threat. It seems concerned with the fate of the human race. Whether this represents some kind of political stance on the part of the Celestial Court as a whole, or a priority peculiar to the Authority is a matter of great debate.": "权力机构有时会在一个好的国王或民主文明面临生存威胁的时候自发出现。它似乎关注着人类的命运。这是否代表了整个天庭的某种政治立场，还是管理局特有的优先权，这是一个非常值得讨论的问题。",
	"Badrashanti Dar, a sage from the Shauraseni Empire speaks of 'an angelic host clad all in golden mail with six wings and a burning helm' who strode across the battlefield of the last Shauraseni emperor, thousands of years ago. This is the earliest known record of the creature that is recognizably the Authority. Dar records the being as pronouncing judgement on the battlefield, saying \"Ours is to defend the children of the earth!\" But this translation is debated and there are none left who speak the sage's language natively.": "绍拉森尼帝国的圣人巴德拉桑提-达尔（Badrashanti Dar）说，\"几千年前，有一位身穿金甲、拥有六只翅膀和燃烧头盔的天使主人，在绍拉森尼最后一位皇帝的战场上大步走过。这是已知最早的关于该生物的记录，可以说是权威。达尔记录了该生物在战场上宣布判决，说 \"我们的任务是保卫地球上的孩子！\" 但这个翻译有争议，现在已经没有人再讲圣人的母语了。",
	"If Dar's record describes the Authority, then there is reason to believe the Authority has been a part of every major, decisive battle between good and evil in the last 5,000 years. Sometimes affecting victory, sometimes being overwhelmed. But in each instance allying itself against tyranny and cruelty. The gods, it seems, have hope for the human race and send their greatest servants to bolster that hope among mortals.": "如果达尔的记录描述了权力机构，那么我们有理由相信，在过去5000年里，权力机构一直是善与恶之间每一场重大、决定性战斗的一部分。有时影响胜利，有时被压倒。但每次都是与暴政和残忍的行为结盟。众神似乎对人类抱有希望，并派他们最伟大的仆人在凡人中加强这种希望。",
	"Well, it finds the biggest, most evil thing and bashes the hell out of it (perhaps literally) with the Brightsword. This thing does {@dice 3d6 + 4d8 + 4} damage to evil creatures, which is like 32 damage on average, and it can do this three times per turn. And it has wings and a fly speed of 40 feet, so it can get where it needs to, to do what it must.": "好吧，它找到了最大的、最邪恶的东西，用亮剑把它打得落花流水（也许是真的）。这东西对邪恶生物造成{@dice 3d6 + 4d8 + 4}的伤害，平均来说就是32点伤害，而且它每回合可以做三次。它有翅膀，飞行速度为40英尺，所以它可以到达它需要的地方，做它必须做的事。",
	"A collection of mouths and hands that arrives and sings power, which is a totally normal thing to do. The Virtue is the Word of the Gods, and that word is death to evil.

	"It is not unusual for the Dominion to make oracular pronouncements, but given that her speech is a cryptic, stream of consciousness open poetry, it unclear whether anyone has ever properly decoded her intent. Instances where, in retrospect, it seems as though a mortal was able to make sense of the Dominion's pronouncement could have been pure coincidence.": "多米尼克发表神谕并不罕见，但鉴于她的讲话是一种隐秘的、意识流的开放式诗歌，目前还不清楚是否有人正确解码过她的意图。现在回想起来，似乎凡人能够理解多米尼克的声明，这可能纯粹是一种巧合。",

	"The great thing about the Dominion is that you don't have to choose whether to attack an enemy or heal an ally. The Ray of Salvation does both, making the Dominion one of the most straightforward servitors you can summon. It flies, it has a pretty good ranged attack, and its resistances mean it's going to be extremely difficult for enemies to deal with. It doesn't do much damage for a CR 8 creature, unless it's fighting evil. {@dice 3d6} twice isn't the end of the world, but the fact that it's healing your allies while damaging your enemies means it will change the tide of battle. Which is the point of servitors!": "多米尼克的伟大之处在于，你不必选择是攻击敌人还是治疗盟友。救世之光两者兼而有之，使多米尼克成为你可以召唤的最直接的仆人之一。它可以飞行，有相当好的远程攻击，它的抵抗力意味着它将是敌人极难对付的。对于一个CR8的生物来说，它的伤害并不高，除非它在与邪恶战斗。{@dice 3d6}两次并不是世界末日，但它在治疗你的盟友的同时伤害你的敌人，这意味着它将改变战斗的态势。这就是仆人的意义所在。",
	"Obviously it should focus on those enemies adjacent to one or more of your allies! But it doesn't have to, if a well-placed bolt of light from its scepter would make a difference.": "很明显，它应该专注于那些与你的一个或多个盟友相邻的敌人！但它不一定要这样做，如果它的权杖发出的闪电会带来不同的效果。但它不一定要这样做，如果从它的权杖上发出一道好的光束就会有所作为。",

	"The Throne is the jailor of the gods. It quarantines evil by trapping it and burning it. It refers to itself, variously, as the Key and the Cage. It is one of the less communicative in the Court, if that is possible, and has its own motivations, which it does not reveal. It is so dedicated to removing evil from the world that it won't obey its master. It chooses its enemies based solely on their commitment to evil powers, not the threat they pose in combat.": "王座是众神的狱卒。它通过诱捕和焚烧来隔离邪恶。它称自己为 \"钥匙 \"和 \"笼子\"，说法不一。如果可以的话，它是宫廷中不太善于沟通的一个，它有自己的动机，但并不透露。它致力于从世界上清除邪恶，以至于它不会服从它的主人。它选择敌人的唯一依据是他们对邪恶力量的承诺，而不是他们在战斗中造成的威胁。",

The tales they tell upon returning are confusing and inconsistent.": "王座是亵渎教团的世袭敌人（详见下文）。当它囚禁了一个邪恶的代理人并退回到......天主所居住的地方时，它把它的俘虏也带走了。只有最强大和最有经验的时空游侠才能尝试跟随。他们回来后讲述的故事是混乱和不一致的。",
	"Each of those who survive the Throne's imprisonment and return to tell the tale describe the realm of the Celestial Court differently. Some describe an island with green grass and tall white marble columns. Some describe a vast field of wheat where prides of lions lounge under a brilliant blue sky. Or a thick forest with tame woodland beasts and ripe fruit hanging from the trees.": "每个从王座的监禁中幸存下来并回来讲述故事的人对天庭的境界都有不同的描述。有些人描述了一个长着绿草和高大的白色大理石柱的岛屿。有些人描述的是一片广阔的麦田，成群的狮子在灿烂的蓝天下休憩。或者是一片茂密的森林，森林里有驯服的野兽，树上挂着成熟的水果。",
	"Whether these are different places, the same place with different regions, or some manifestation created from the mind of the imprisoned is not known. Only the Knights of Desolation know the secret of gaining access to that realm, and they will not reveal what they know.": "这些是不同的地方，是同一地方有不同的区域，还是从被囚禁者的头脑中创造出来的一些表现形式，我们不得而知。只有荒芜骑士知道进入那个领域的秘密，而且他们不会透露他们所知道的东西。",
	"It chooses the most evil enemy creature (by whatever metric you want) and attacks it. Once it is imprisoned, the Throne will obey its summoner and attack whomever they want, but not if it would free the evil trapped within.": "它选择最邪恶的敌方生物（按你想要的任何标准）并攻击它。一旦被囚禁，王座将服从其召唤者，攻击他们想要攻击的人，但如果会释放被困在里面的邪恶，则不会。",

	"The greatest of the Celestial Court, the Seraph devastates anything on the battlefield foolish enough to oppose the heroes, taking special interest in evil creatures, obviously, but also in chaotic beings. It just vomits damage onto everything and everyone.": "塞拉弗是天庭中最伟大的，它破坏了战场上任何愚蠢到反对英雄的东西，显然对邪恶的生物特别感兴趣，但也对混乱的生命感兴趣。它只是向所有的东西和人吐出伤害。",
	"It has the same telepathy the rest of the Celestial Court have, but it rarely uses it for anything other than shouting single-word epithets into people's minds. \"Burn!\" \"Finish!\" \"Exult!\"": "它拥有与天庭其他成员相同的心灵感应，但它很少用它来做任何事情，而只是向人们的头脑中喊出单字的辱骂。\"燃烧！\" \"结束！\" \"赞美！\"",
	"In spite of not having like...a face, or eyes, the Seraph cannot be flanked or surprised. It can use each weapon twice, so you decide if it needs to be in melee or not, and then either make two bow shots each from Alpha and Omega, or two mace attacks each from Good and Law. Alpha heals allies next to enemies it damages, which will help you choose which enemies to get next to.": "尽管没有......脸，也没有眼睛，但塞拉弗不能被包抄或惊吓。它可以使用每种武器两次，所以你要决定它是否需要处于近战状态，然后用阿尔法和欧米茄各打两张弓，或者用善和法各打两把矛。阿尔法会治疗它所伤害的敌人旁边的盟友，这将有助于你选择挨着哪些敌人。",

They hope, by nurturing this court, to challenge the current King and Queen of Chaos.": "在此后的岁月里，女王起起落落，现在发现自己与马拉达-迪克特姆结盟了。他们之间是一种便利的婚姻。双方都看到了联盟带给他们的好处。双方都不期望对方给予更多，也许正是因为这个原因，在他们漫长的合作岁月中，双方都没有背叛过对方。那会有什么意义呢？每个人都已经在为自己的最佳利益而行动，而且只为自己的最佳利益而行动。他们希望通过培养这个宫廷，挑战目前的混沌国王和皇后。",
	"The oldest surviving member of the Court, with the possible exception of the madness-flesh Uursovk, the Queen is languid and slow to anger. She looks at her enemies with mild annoyance. They are temporary. Change is eternal. She will show them.": "女王是宫廷中现存的最年长的成员，可能只有疯狂的乌尔索夫克是个例外，她无精打采，愤怒起来很慢。她带着温和的恼怒看着她的敌人。他们是暂时的。改变是永恒的。她将向他们展示。",
	"She rides an animation of skeletons harvested from the creatures she's killed. They are not undead, more like a moving sculpture. The Queen is an artist, with bone her preferred medium. Ideally the bones of the living.": "她骑着从她杀死的生物中收获的骷髅的动画。它们不是亡灵，更像是一个移动的雕塑。女王是一位艺术家，她喜欢用骨头作为媒介。最理想的是活人的骨头。",
	"A powerful spellcaster, the Queen arrives armed with a combination of spells designed to aid the summoner and damn their enemies. Freedom of movement will undo many ills, and stoneskin or shield of faith will help her allies withstand damage. Death ward is for those allies close to death. Dispel magic is a Swiss army knife of solutions to many problems.": "女王是一个强大的施法者，她带着旨在帮助召唤者和诅咒敌人的法术组合来到这里。行动自由将消除许多弊病，而石头皮或信仰之盾将帮助她的盟友抵御伤害。死亡守护是为了那些接近死亡的盟友。驱散魔法是一把瑞士军刀，可以解决很多问题。",
	"And of course she has many standard offensive spells, including banishment for those enemies summoned from other planes by evil priests with their own temples!": "当然，她还有许多标准的攻击性法术，包括对那些由拥有自己的神庙的邪恶牧师从其他星球召唤来的敌人的放逐！她的法术也是如此。",
	"The Queen's favorite offensive tactic, of course, is her Ossuary. By taking control of a target's skeleton, she can freeze them in place, imprisoning them with their own bones. On average this is only going to last two rounds, if it works, but that's still two rounds of an enemy doing nothing. Since its DC is Constitution-based, she tends to target spellcasters and glass cannons.": "当然，女王最喜欢的进攻手段是她的 \"骨灰盒\"。通过控制目标的骨架，她可以将他们冻结在原地，用他们自己的骨头将他们囚禁起来。如果成功的话，这平均只能持续两轮，但这仍然是两轮敌人无所作为的时间。因为它的DC是基于宪法的，所以她倾向于针对施法者和玻璃炮。",
	"The Vizier of the Court, Lord Rall is Maladar's personal wizard. Once Lord Rall had a more conventional form, but he forgot it somewhere and never seemed to notice. As he demonstrates in battle, he can reform himself out of any old organs you may have lying around.": "法院的维齐尔，拉尔勋爵是马拉达的私人巫师。拉尔勋爵曾经有一个更传统的形式，但他把它忘在了某个地方，而且似乎从未注意到。正如他在战斗中展示的那样，他可以用你身边的任何旧器官来改造自己。",
	"Rall is precise and surgical. Tactical. He likes experimenting on his enemies. He is fascinated by creatures with one set form. Creatures who find their identities wrapped up in their shape. How strange, Lord Rall thinks. Imagine what a different person you would be if you wore your brains on the outside. Or if you had many fewer, or many more, limbs. Only fools fear change.": "拉尔是精确的和手术式的。有战术性。他喜欢在他的敌人身上做实验。他对只有一个固定形态的生物非常着迷。那些发现自己的身份被包裹在形状中的生物。多么奇怪啊，拉尔勋爵想。想象一下，如果你把你的大脑穿在外面，你会是一个多么不同的人。或者如果你有更少或更多的肢体。只有傻瓜才害怕改变。",
	"Rall has no ambition, does not plot or scheme. For this reason he does not rise higher than vizier to this, the lower court. But neither does he need fear betrayal.": "拉尔没有野心，不搞阴谋诡计。由于这个原因，他在这个下级法院的地位不比宰相高。但他也不需要害怕背叛。",
	"Rall is a potent wizard. Unlike the Queen of Bone, Rall is not particularly interested in helping his allies, preferring to drop cloudkill on his enemies or lock them in place with black tentacles.": "拉尔是一个强有力的巫师。与骨后不同，拉尔对帮助他的盟友并不特别感兴趣，他更喜欢在他的敌人身上投下云杀，或者用黑色的触手把他们锁在原地。",
	"Lord Rall channels his power through {@footnote The Staff of Changing|Like all the servitor items, it possesses no magic of its own, so the players don't suddenly come into possession of a powerful artifact if they kill Lord Rall.}, molding enemies to suit his terrible whims. Because of his deep understanding of form and changing, he does not need to concentrate on this. He fully expects to be able to turn every enemy in the battle into slimy things, given time.": "拉尔勋爵通过{@footnote The Staff of Changing|Like all the servitor items, it possesses no magic of its own, so the players don't suddenly come into possession of a powerful artifact if they kill Lord Rall.}引导他的力量，塑造敌人以适应他可怕的奇想。由于他对形态和变化的深刻理解，他不需要专注于此。他完全期望能够把战斗中的每个敌人都变成黏糊糊的东西，只要有时间。",
	"The Mad Oracle, the Madness-flesh, Uursovk may once have been a king or queen of Chaos itself. No one remembers that far back. Rumors are easy to come by, tales of things older than the Thrones themselves. Things of pure changing power, with no minds, no will except to remake the universe in their own terrible fluctuating imageless images.": "疯狂的神谕，疯狂的肉体，乌尔索夫克可能曾经是混沌本身的国王或女王。没有人记得那么久远的事。谣言是很容易得到的，比王座本身更古老的东西的故事。纯粹的变化力量的东西，没有思想，没有意志，除了用他们自己可怕的波动的无想象力的图像重塑宇宙。",
	"Uursovk is the only member of the Court who is vulnerable to shapechanging magics, lacking sufficient will to prevent it.": "乌尔索夫克是法院中唯一容易受到变形魔法影响的成员，他缺乏足够的意志来阻止它。",
	"Any image of Uursovk is by definition a facile rendering by lesser minds. Gazing upon the Mindwiper, one sees organs and limbs twisting and reshaping. Often one feels one is seeing many sides of the same beast at the same time, or an amalgam of many different creatures each superimposed over the others. But this is no image—their limbs meld into each other, twisting in torturous ways. Often the various appendages shudder, as though the creatures who once had these body parts are suffering incredible agony.": "根据定义，乌尔索夫克的任何形象都是由较小的头脑进行的简单渲染。凝视着心灵捕手，人们看到器官和肢体的扭曲和重塑。人们常常觉得自己同时看到了同一只野兽的许多面，或者是许多不同生物的混合体，每一种都叠加在其他生物上。但这不是图像，它们的肢体相互融合，以折磨人的方式扭曲。通常，各种附属物都在颤抖，仿佛曾经拥有这些身体部位的生物正在遭受难以置信的痛苦。",
	"The smell itself is enough to choke someone, a rotting abattoir of putrid maggoty meat.": "这种气味本身就足以让人窒息，一个腐烂的屠宰场，腐烂的蛆虫肉。",
	"Uursovk is also known as the Oracle of the Court of All Flesh, occasionally making prophetic pronouncements that often come true. Uursovk's madness in no way impairs his second sight.": "乌尔索夫克也被称为 \"众肉法院的神谕\"，他偶尔会发表预言，而这些预言往往会成为现实。乌尔索夫克的疯狂丝毫不影响他的第二视觉。",
	"The Madness-flesh broadcasts an Insanity Field that interferes with conscious thought, causing nausea in intelligent creatures. Because its DC is based on Intelligence, maybe don't drop this guy next to the enemy magic-user. Fighters and rogues are more likely to fail their saves.": "疯狂的肉体广播了一个干扰意识思维的疯狂场，使智能生物感到恶心。因为它的DC是基于智力的，所以也许不要把这家伙放在敌人的魔法使用者旁边。斗士和流氓更有可能使他们的救赎失败。",
	"Just the sight of Uursovk ignites its Madness Aura, which blocks enemies' minds from being able to formulate the thoughts required to cast spells. This is a passive ability, though, so you don't have to burn an action to do it.": "只要看到乌尔索夫克就会点燃它的疯狂光环，它能阻止敌人的头脑形成施法所需的思想。但这是一个被动的能力，所以你不需要用行动来完成它。",
	"Uursovk's epic closer is Meld Flesh, which literally melts two adjacent enemies into one gestalt. Not as radical as it sounds, the gestalt creature can do anything the original two creatures could do, but it only gets one turn. This one prompts a Constitution saving throw, so it's a good option for hitting magic-users and glass cannons.": "乌尔索夫克的史诗结局是 \"肉体融合\"，它实际上是将两个相邻的敌人融化为一个格式化生物。这并不像它听起来那么激进，这个格式化的生物可以做任何原来两个生物可以做的事情，但它只有一个回合。这一招提示了宪法救赎，所以它是打击魔法使用者和玻璃大炮的一个好选择。",
	"Currently one of the Dukes of Chaos, Lord Dictum serves the Red Queen. He is ambitious and plans to replace both the King and Queen...but so do all the Dukes and Duchesses of Chaos. For now, Dictum bides his time and waits.": "目前，迪克特姆勋爵是混沌公爵之一，为红皇后服务。他雄心勃勃，计划取代国王和王后......但所有的混沌公爵和公爵夫人也是如此。目前，迪克图姆在等待时机，等待着。",
	"Dictum does not enjoy being pulled to the Mundane World and forced to do the bidding of uni-form mortals. The Red Queen knows this, and enjoys dispatching Dictum.": "迪克特姆不喜欢被拉到世俗世界，被迫听从单体凡人的命令。红皇后知道这一点，并乐于派遣迪克特姆。",
	"What she may not know is that Maladar has the power, alone of all the servitors, to summon the other members of his court. This means His Grace may have power beyond the Thrones of Chaos. May know something the other members of the court do not. If he summons the rest of his court in some other realm, who knows what new court of Chaos might be established there.": "她可能不知道的是，马拉达有能力，在所有的仆人中，单独召唤他的法庭的其他成员。这意味着陛下可能拥有超越混沌王座的力量。可能知道一些宫廷其他成员不知道的事情。如果他在其他领域召唤他的宫廷的其他成员，谁知道那里会建立什么新的混沌宫廷。",
	"Maladar chafes at his summoning and openly yearns to unleash his power on whatever universe he finds himself in. But...the Red Queen commands, and Maladar Dictum must obey. For now...": "马拉达对他的召唤感到不满，并公开渴望在他发现自己所在的任何宇宙中释放他的力量。但是......红皇后的命令，马拉达-迪克特姆必须服从。就目前而言...",
	"This dude...you really don't want to damage this guy, it's only going to make things harder for you. Unless he's on your side, in which case absolutely dump him in the middle of a melee and stand back. He will, after only one round of attacks, be dealing outstanding amounts of damage. He'll have claws and tentacles or eleven-tacles or twelve-tacles!": "这家伙......你真的不想伤害这家伙，这只会让你的事情更难办。除非他是站在你这边的，在这种情况下，绝对要把他扔到近战中间，然后站在后面。只经过一轮攻击，他就会造成巨大的伤害。他将会有爪子和触手，或者是11个触手或12个触手！这就是他的优势。",
	"If you really want to see things get out of control very quickly, watch Maladar summon Korsoth Vastikan and stand back as the Duke of Chaos orders his ranger to fire four arrows from Formkiller into him. Boom! Instant four extra attacks per round oh my god. Whose idea was this? Madness!": "如果你真的想看到事情很快失去控制，就看马拉达召唤科索斯-瓦斯蒂坎，并在混沌公爵命令他的游侠向他发射四支杀阵的箭时站在后面。轰隆隆! 每轮即时的四次额外攻击，哦，我的上帝。这是谁的主意？疯狂!",
	"The swashbuckling adventurers of the Arcadians, the Mantis Knights love dueling and drinking and terrible poetry. The greatest of them, like Lady Eweshtleth, keep an air of grave dignity about them, because they have known battle across the Myriad Worlds. But most Mantis Knights just want to show up, do something dashing and acrobatic, spit an enemy upon their sword, and then go carousing with the mortals who summoned them.": "螳螂骑士是阿卡迪亚人的冒险家，他们喜欢决斗、喝酒和可怕的诗歌。他们中最伟大的人，如艾维斯特雷斯女士，保持着一种严肃的尊严，因为他们经历了跨越无数世界的战斗。但大多数螳螂骑士只想出现，做一些潇洒的杂技表演，在他们的剑上吐出一个敌人，然后和召唤他们的凡人一起狂欢。",
	"Their armor makes them very hard to grapple, and they enjoy showing this off by taunting enemies who rely on grappling. They bolster the spirits of their allies with heroism and shield of faith, making mortals almost the equals of an Arcadian! You're welcome!": "他们的盔甲使他们很难被抓住，他们喜欢通过嘲弄那些依赖抓捕的敌人来炫耀这一点。他们用英雄主义和信仰之盾支持他们的盟友的精神，使凡人几乎与阿卡迪亚人平起平坐! 不客气!",
	"Otherwise, they enjoy dancing around the battlefield, laying into enemies with their twin rapiers. Simple pleasures.": "否则，他们喜欢在战场上跳舞，用他们的双头剑攻击敌人。简单的快乐。",
	"The Monarchon is the embodiment of youth and death, spring and fall. It is gay and sprightly and a harbinger of doom. Once, mortals knew that to gaze upon the death's-head skull of the Monarchon spelled the end. Now, it's been so long since last the Arcadians lived in the Mundane World that mortals must learn these lessons all over again.": "君子兰是青春和死亡的化身，是春天和秋天的象征。它是快乐的、活泼的，也是厄运的预兆。曾经，凡人都知道，注视着君主神的死亡头颅就意味着结束。现在，阿卡德人已经很久没有在世俗世界生活了，凡人必须重新学习这些课程。",
	"The Monarchon enjoys speaking with those who summoned her, but she speaks in cryptic, open poetry. This language is perfectly clear to other created fey, the naiads and dryads and centaurs, but is usually opaque to mortals.": "Monarchon喜欢和那些召唤她的人说话，但她说的是隐晦的、开放的诗歌。这种语言对其他被造的精灵，如naiads和dryads以及半人马来说是非常清楚的，但对凡人来说通常是不透明的。",
	"\"Trees grow roots, but also leaves.\"": "\"树要长根，也要长叶\"。",

	"Pretty cringey. But don't say that around the Monarchon—she might turn your face inside out.": "相当令人厌恶。但不要在君主的身边说这些话，她可能会把你的脸转过来。",
	"When not withering or hypnotizing her enemies, she is pleasant to be around. She is fascinated by mortals. Loves watching the artfully slow decay of their flesh into inevitable death. If she had her way, she'd stick around for the final myocardial infarction and then celebrate your death, possibly by baking your corpse into bread. So weird.": "当不对她的敌人进行枯萎或催眠时，她是令人愉快的。她对凡人很着迷。喜欢看着他们的肉体艺术性地缓慢腐烂，进入不可避免的死亡。如果她有办法，她会坚持到最后的心肌梗塞，然后庆祝你的死亡，可能是把你的尸体烤成面包。太奇怪了。",
	"The Monarchon can fly—I mean, of course she can, look at those wings. She prefers to fly around the battlefield, casting spells and hypnotizing enemies. The saving throw for her Hypnotic Display is Wisdom-based, so she often targets melee fighters or rogues. She won't bother using it on enemy shamans or priests.": "君子兰能飞--我是说，她当然能飞，看看她的翅膀。她更喜欢在战场上飞行，施展法术和催眠敌人。她的催眠术的蓄力是以智慧为基础的，所以她经常针对近战战士或流氓。她不会对敌人的巫师或牧师使用。",
	"Finally, if she is attacked or otherwise there is great need, she will land and use her Withering Touch. This is something of a last resort—she prefers to use this ability on enemies close to death.": "最后，如果她受到攻击或有其他重大需要，她会降落并使用她的枯萎之触。这是最后的手段，她更喜欢对接近死亡的敌人使用这种能力。",

	"Nerium the Petal Dragon, known also as the Oleander Dragon, is one of the prize pets of Val and normally slumbers decoratively in one of the courtyards. Its disguise is so perfect, newcomers to the Court often fail to recognize it's not actually a flowering topiary shrub in the shape of a sleeping dragon.": "花瓣龙Nerium，也被称为夹竹桃龙，是瓦尔的得意宠物之一，通常在某个院子里装饰性地睡着。它的伪装是如此完美，新来的人往往无法认出它实际上不是一个开花的灌木，而是一个睡着的龙的形状。",

This has no practical value other than being artful and poetic, which is really the only thing the Arcadians care about.": "Nerium是宫廷中唯一真正的变身者，她喜欢赞美那些召唤她的人，把他们变成一个非常谄媚的形象。除了艺术性和诗意之外，这没有任何实际价值，这也是阿卡德人唯一关心的事情。",

	"Unlike any other dragon...and most creatures, the Oleander Dragon has no physical attack. It has no teeth or claws and considers such things crude. She prefers to be beautiful and would rather awe enemies so overmuch with its perfect glamour as to force them to reconsider the terrible decisions they made in their lives and abandon all violence.": "与其他任何龙......以及大多数生物不同，夹竹桃龙没有物理攻击。它没有牙齿或爪子，认为这种东西很粗糙。她更喜欢美丽，宁愿用它完美的魅力让敌人感到敬畏，以至于迫使他们重新考虑他们在生活中做出的可怕决定，放弃一切暴力。",

She opens combat with the spores from her Pollen Breath, then sings the song of cestilani, which can end a battle all by itself.": "由于缺乏物理攻击，尼里姆依靠植入的梦魇用恐惧来压倒她的敌人。她用花粉呼吸的孢子开启战斗，然后唱起塞斯提拉尼之歌，这首歌本身就能结束一场战斗。",
	"Tasked with defending and escorting guests to Arcadia, the Ash Marshal is also the only member of the Court to be regularly sent seeking across the planes, dispatched by Val to bring {@footnote those who would harm his creation|The elves.} to justice.

Because Alloy is neutral ground, the Knights are often seen in the company of visiting members of the Court of Arcadia (especially the Mantis Knights or the Orchid Count) or the Knights of Axiom. Even the unchanging changers from the Court of All Flesh are welcome. The Knights of Fire seem to enjoy the company of Korsoth Vastikan especially.": "合金骑士享有在整个时空的冲突中保持中立的特权。因为合金是中立地，骑士们经常被看到与来访的阿卡迪亚宫廷成员（尤其是螳螂骑士或兰花伯爵）或公理院骑士为伍。即使是来自 \"万物之庭 \"的不变的变革者也受到欢迎。火之骑士们似乎特别喜欢科索斯-瓦斯蒂坎的陪伴。",
	"The Knights keep tabs on the most powerful visitors to Alloy. While within the city walls, they have a sixth sense that alerts them to the presence in the city of newcomers who are able to cause a lot of trouble. Presuming they've sobered up from the previous night's festivities, the Knights will check on the newcomer to make sure they're behaving.": "骑士们一直在监视合金的最强大的访客。在城墙内，他们有一种第六感，能提醒他们注意那些能够造成很多麻烦的新来者出现在城市里。假设他们已经从前一晚的庆祝活动中清醒过来，骑士们会检查新来者的情况，以确保他们的行为。",
	"The Knights of Fire make no pretense of hiding while doing this, but the Knights of Air are skilled at following powerful entities without them knowing about it. Should violence threaten, the Knights can instantly summon a Source and a Pillar, though this power is granted them only in the city of Alloy.": "火之骑士在做这件事的时候并不假装隐藏，但空气之骑士擅长在他们不知道的情况下跟踪强大的实体。如果有暴力威胁，骑士们可以立即召唤出一个源泉和一个支柱，尽管这种力量只在合金城被赋予。",
	"A Knight of Air is pretty straightforward, relying primarily on The Sword of Clouds, which apart from its cool name has no other extraordinary property. Its spells are situational, with no tactical theme. Wind wall will section off the battlefield and pummel anyone caught in it, protecting allies. The Wind Lords, as the Knights of Air are sometimes called, use gaseous form to protect an ally.": "空中骑士是相当简单的，主要依靠云中剑，除了它很酷的名字之外，没有其他特别的属性。它的法术是情景性的，没有战术主题。风墙会将战场分割开来，对陷入其中的人进行打击，保护盟友。风之领主，有时被称为空气骑士，使用气态的形式来保护盟友。",
	"Otherwise, the Wind Lords use their high Armor Class and crazy-good movement to get where they need to engage enemies in melee, often blowing right past enemies, enduring attacks of opportunity, relying on their plate and shield to survive.": "否则，风之领主就会利用他们的高护甲等级和疯狂的移动来到达他们需要与敌人近战的地方，经常直接吹过敌人，忍受机会攻击，依靠他们的板子和盾牌来生存。",
	"The Magistrates of the Burning City are the priests and judges of the Lady of Fire. The motes, sources, and knights are diagnosticians. They identify and evaluate the problem. The Lords of Storm cure it.": "燃烧之城的行政官是火之女神的祭司和法官。微粒、来源和骑士是诊断师。他们识别和评估问题。风暴领主则负责治疗。",
	"Exactly as high and mighty as you would expect them to be, the Magistrates are a cruel and bastardly bunch, enjoying their power, using it casually, some say recklessly. They give no thought to the consequences of their actions—they assume the Sources, Pillars, and Knights have done their jobs and identified a criminal. The Magistrates arrive ready to prosecute.": "正如你所期望的那样，地方法官是一群残忍而混蛋的人，他们享受他们的权力，随意地使用它，有人说是鲁莽的。他们不考虑自己行为的后果--他们认为源头、支柱和骑士们已经完成了他们的工作，并确定了罪犯。行政官们来到这里准备起诉。",
	"\"You have done nothing of value in your short and meaningless life. Take this opportunity to at least die well.\"": "\"在你短暂而无意义的一生中，你没有做任何有价值的事情。借此机会，至少要好好地死去。\"",
	"The Magistrates know that when they are called to the Mundane World, it is to aid the concordant and damn their enemies. Many of the Storm Lords' spells help the PCs—enhance ability, mass cure wounds, freedom of movement—but just as many are offensive. Flame strike is a classic opening. Banishment can handle enemy servitors summoned by evil priests and warlocks.": "行政官们知道，当他们被召唤到世俗世界时，是为了帮助和谐的人并诅咒他们的敌人。风暴领主的许多法术都能帮助NPC--增强能力、大量治疗伤口、行动自由--但也有许多是攻击性的。火焰打击是一个经典的开场。放逐术可以处理由邪恶的牧师和术士召唤的敌方仆从。",

Use this as soon as the Magistrate arrives to maximize the number of rolls you'll get on the recharge, increasing the likelihood you'll get to use it again.": "县长最致命的武器是风暴打击，它结合了连锁闪电和一些辐射伤害。县长一来就使用它，以最大限度地增加你在充能时获得的滚动次数，增加你再次使用它的可能性。",
	"The High Templars serve the Lady of Brass, but unlike the rest of the Court of Elements they were not created by her.

	"The High Templar of Dust focuses on movement, moving through enemies to use its Scour ability, damaging everyone standing around with Sandstorm, and generally wading into enemies.

It tends to fire off Lightning and Fire before engaging in melee with its halberd.": "尘土高阶圣殿骑士专注于移动，穿过敌人来使用它的清除能力，用沙尘暴伤害站在周围的每个人，并且一般都是涉入敌人。它的装甲等级并不惊人，但它有大量的命中率，应该能经受住几轮的惩罚。它倾向于在用戟进行近战之前发射闪电和火焰。",
	"One of the oldest species of gemstone dragons, the emeralds studied the lore of the sea and the unique, chaotic boundary between sea and land. It was the tide pools and estuaries that fascinated them, and they developed a theory of the timescape based on this intermingling. The Estuarial Hypothesis holds that the Mundane World lies on an interspace boundary between the worlds, and for this reason good, evil, chaos, and law all intermingle here.": "作为最古老的宝石龙物种之一，祖母绿研究海洋的传说，以及海洋和陆地之间独特的、混乱的边界。正是潮池和河口让他们着迷，他们在这种交融的基础上发展了一种时空的理论。河口假说认为，世俗世界位于世界之间的空间边界上，为此，善、恶、混乱和法律都在这里交融。",

Their forelimbs atrophied until now all that remains of them are a handful of small bones that can only be seen via dissection.": "他们对海洋的痴迷和他们独特的生物和节奏使他们进入了海洋，直到经过一万代，他们特别适应了海洋。他们的前肢萎缩了，直到现在只剩下少数几块小骨头，只有通过解剖才能看到。",
	"Water dampens the dragon's mindspeech and as a result their psionics has evolved to be stronger, to pierce this liquid veil. As a side effect, an emerald dragon's mind is so powerful that it interferes with the thinking portions of other creatures' brains, making it very difficult for them to maintain concentration on their spells.": "水抑制了龙的心语，因此它们的幻术进化得更加强大，可以穿透这层液体的面纱。作为一种副作用，绿宝石龙的心智非常强大，它可以干扰其他生物大脑的思考部分，使他们很难保持对法术的专注。",
	"Their interest in our world and its relation to others makes them experts on the planes. Rumors speak of emerald dragons whose wings propel them naturally through the Sea of Stars that separates worlds, allowing them to travel at will to any plane. But this behavior has never been witnessed by mortals.": "他们对我们的世界及其与其他世界的关系的兴趣使他们成为各平面的专家。有传言说，翡翠龙的翅膀能自然地推动它们穿过分隔各世界的星海，使它们能够随意前往任何位面。但这种行为从未被凡人目睹过。",

	"They alone understand the danger that illusionists present to the Mundane World, because they alone know what even the most powerful spellcasters do not: illusion magic, properly applied, could replace this reality. Starve it until it withers, replace it with a phantasm. They are happy to sequester themselves from the world, locking their knowledge away. But should a sufficiently powerful illusionist catch a glimpse of the power contained within their spells, they will wake, seeking mortals to help them prevent the end of the Real. They believe that illusions are manifestations in this world of beings, objects, and power from other worlds—and that, given the chance, those alien worlds would attack ours.": "只有他们了解幻术师对世俗世界的危险，因为只有他们知道即使是最强大的施法者也不知道的事情：幻术魔法，适当地应用，可以取代这个现实。饿死它，直到它枯萎，用一个幻象取代它。他们乐于将自己与世界隔离开来，把他们的知识锁起来。但如果一个足够强大的幻术师瞥见了他们法术中所包含的力量，他们就会醒来，寻求凡人帮助他们阻止真实的终结。他们相信，幻觉是来自其他世界的生命、物体和力量在这个世界上的表现--如果有机会，这些异世界会攻击我们。",
	"They are measured and formal, slow to give trust. They like seeing things done properly, traditions obeyed and upheld. If you approach one with respect and introduce yourself properly and do not saw the air too much with your hands, then they will listen and grant you the opportunity to impress them.": "他们是有分寸的，正式的，缓慢地给予信任。他们喜欢看到事情得到妥善处理，传统得到遵守和维护。如果你以尊重的态度接近一个人，适当地介绍自己，不要用你的手在空气中看到太多，那么他们会倾听，并给予你机会来打动他们。",
	"Eldest, first, the sapphire dragons inspire awe in any who see them. They guard the knowledge of past and future and the power that lets one shift between them. They approve of the dwarves, who imposed the rigid rules of causality on the world, and consider the remnant domains of the elves, the wodes, as a danger. Not a threat per se, because they know it is in the elves' nature to ignore past and future, but when mortals exploit this or discover the means to move through time, or summon creatures from the past and future, then the sapphire dragons get riled up.": "最年长的，首先，蓝宝石龙让任何看到它们的人感到敬畏。他们守护着对过去和未来的了解，以及让人在它们之间转换的力量。他们赞同矮人，他们把严格的因果关系规则强加给世界，并认为精灵的残余领域，即沃德，是一种危险。这本身并不是一种威胁，因为他们知道忽略过去和未来是精灵的天性，但当凡人利用这一点或发现穿越时间的方法，或召唤来自过去和未来的生物时，蓝宝石龙就会被激怒。",
	"Of course, because they guard this knowledge, they are also experts on it and thus are sometimes the best sages to seek out if you are in dire need. They will aid adventurers, using their knowledge to bend the rules of the timescape if they feel the danger warrants it.": "当然，由于他们守护着这些知识，他们也是这方面的专家，因此如果你有迫切的需要，有时是最好的圣人。他们会帮助冒险者，如果他们觉得危险有必要，就会利用他们的知识来弯曲时空的规则。",
	"Being oldest, they are also the most reserved, taciturn. Even the young sapphires are aware of their species' place in history and expect to be treated with respect. They talk like old university professors who know they have tenure and expect everyone to hang on their every word.": "作为最年长的人，他们也是最矜持、最沉默寡言的。即使是年轻的蓝宝石也意识到他们这个物种在历史上的地位，并期望得到尊重。他们说话就像大学里的老教授一样，知道自己有任期，希望每个人都能听他们的每句话。",
	"The youngest species, the most enthusiastic about the world, the one you're most likely to meet, topaz dragons study magic obsessively, and their older kin consider this juvenile.

Harumph.": "他们为之着迷，他们收集卷轴和书籍，就像其他龙囤积金块和宝石一样，黄玉龙觉得这些东西隐约有威胁性。为什么对宝石特别着迷？如果你不是想表达自己的观点，为什么要睡在它们的床上？我没有睡在鳞片的床上。欢呼吧。",
	"They all seem like absentminded professors. They accumulate so much lore that they spend all their time categorizing it, and just when they have everything neatly filed away they realize this one treatise doesn't fit any classification and the whole thing must be redone from scratch. Ugh. It will take millennia at this rate.": "他们看起来都像心不在焉的教授。他们积累了如此多的传说，以至于他们把所有的时间都花在了分类上，而就在他们把所有的东西都整齐地归档时，他们发现这篇论文不适合任何分类，整个事情必须从头开始重新做。唉。以这样的速度要花上几千年的时间。",
	"They're approachable and easy to talk to as long as you don't mind never getting a straight answer.

They can imagine anything and defend it with references, many of which contradict each other.": "他们平易近人，容易交谈，只要你不介意永远得不到一个直接的答案。考虑到他们有那么多书，你会认为他们会是一切的专家，但事实恰恰相反。他们可以想象出任何东西，并以参考资料为其辩护，其中许多是相互矛盾的。",
	"The renegades of the jeweled dragons, the amethyst dragons seek new knowledge and so manipulate mortals to do dangerous, even deadly things in order to push the boundary of the known.": "作为珠宝龙的叛徒，紫晶龙寻求新的知识，因此操纵凡人做危险甚至致命的事情，以推动已知的边界。",
	"The other gemstone dragons are aware of this dangerous obsession but turn a blind eye to it. Perhaps they're afraid of meddling, or perhaps they look forward to benefitting from the new lore produced this way, without having to get their hands dirty.": "其他宝石龙意识到这种危险的痴迷，但对它视而不见。也许他们害怕多管闲事，也许他们期待从这样产生的新传说中获益，而不必弄脏自己的手。",
	"The amethyst are sinister, manipulating, and scheming. They enjoy using the psionic manifestation form (Not all known manifestations are listed here.) to disguise themselves as mortals and infiltrate colleges of wizardry and sorcery. They have no feeling or remorse for mortals and willingly drive them and ultimately sacrifice them if it means learning something new about the fabric of the timescape.": "紫晶人是阴险的、操纵的、有阴谋的。他们喜欢使用幻象的表现形式（这里并没有列出所有已知的表现形式。），将自己伪装成凡人，潜入巫师和巫术的学院。他们对凡人没有任何感觉或悔恨，并愿意驱使他们，最终牺牲他们，如果这意味着学习一些关于时空结构的新知识的话。",
	"When encountered, they are often conciliatory, deferent. They want to put you at ease to catch you off guard. They are helpful, they love helping mortals, they love making mortals trust them, because it is a short path from trust to dependence. They cannot be trusted.": "遇到时，他们往往是和解的，恭敬的。他们想让你放心，让你措手不及。他们乐于助人，他们喜欢帮助凡人，他们喜欢让凡人信任他们，因为从信任到依赖是一条捷径。他们不能被信任。",
	"The Inexorable limitations of Space forbid anyone from moving from point A to point Z without passing through the rest of the alphabet. Certainly nothing as vulgar as teleportation is allowed on Axiom.": "空间的不可逾越的限制禁止任何人从A点移动到Z点而不经过字母表的其他部分。当然，在公理号上不允许有像传送这样粗俗的行为。",
	"\"The fundamental theorem forbids,\" is a common refrain whenever Space prevents someone from moving in a manner contrary to the strict laws of motion.

	"Space is the light infantry of the Inexorables, and pretty easy to use in combat. Fast like all the Knights of Axiom, Space uses its 40 feet of movement to get where it needs to be, to bludgeon its enemies. It prefers to focus on spellcasters but obeys the commands of the creature who summoned it.": "太空是Inexorables的轻型步兵，在战斗中相当容易使用。像所有公理骑士一样快速，空间利用其40英尺的移动距离到达它需要去的地方，来打击它的敌人。它更喜欢集中精力对付施法者，但服从召唤它的生物的命令。",
	"\"This microstate partition lacks sufficient entropy. I will repair.\"": "\"这个微观状态的分区缺乏足够的熵。我将修复。\"",

	"Death does not cause this ending, it enforces it. It arrives ready to stop something or someone trying to undo the Law of Death. Therefore, it focuses most on the undead, on those things persisting after their natural end.": "死亡并没有造成这种结局，而是强制它。它随时准备阻止试图解除死亡法则的东西或人。因此，它最关注的是不死之身，是那些在其自然结束后仍然存在的事物。",
	"It also has the power to prevent a creature from meeting its end before its time. Why it is granted the power to use magic, when magic is chaos and therefore anathema to the Inexorables, is a question Death does not know the answer to. It only knows it can prevent.": "它也有能力阻止一个生物在它的时间之前达到它的终点。为什么它被授予使用魔法的力量，而魔法是混沌的，因此对Inexorables来说是不祥的，这是一个死神不知道答案的问题。它只知道它可以阻止。",
	"This thing is powerful, but not hard to run. Its Law of Death radiates damage to undead, and its Death to Undeath ability has an obvious use. But if there aren't any undead around, it'll happily wade into combat for you, just smashing things with its hammer-like fists.": "这东西很强大，但并不难办。它的死亡法则会对亡灵造成伤害，它的 \"死而复生 \"能力有明显的用途。但如果周围没有任何亡灵，它就会很乐意为你涉足战斗，只是用它那锤子般的拳头砸东西。",
	"A close cousin to the Inexorables of Death and Fate, the Law of Change states that what has been done cannot be undone.

	"Depending on the battle, and the enemies you're fighting, forcing them to make all attacks with a 10 result on their die may mean they simply can't hit your more heavily armored allies. Or they can't miss, so be careful with where you position Fate.": "根据战斗的情况，以及你正在战斗的敌人，强迫他们用10的结果进行所有的攻击，可能意味着他们根本无法击中你的重装甲的盟友。或者他们不能失手，所以要注意你对命运的定位。",
	"The Destiny Light makes an enemy always do average damage if they fail their save. This is incredibly useful against boss monsters with attacks that combine many dice and will give players a lot more certainty about what it can do. They will know, for instance, how many more successful attacks they can weather.": "命运之光使敌人在救赎失败的情况下总是造成平均伤害。这在对付拥有结合许多骰子的攻击的BOSS怪物时非常有用，而且会让玩家对它的能力有更大的把握。例如，他们会知道自己还能经受多少次成功的攻击。",
	"Because Fate does not use dice (see The Law of Fate, below) there may be enemies Fate simply cannot hit. Fate is not omniscient though and won't know that until it tests an enemy. Once it fails to hit, it won't attack the same enemy again.": "因为命运不使用骰子（见下面的命运法则），所以可能有一些敌人命运根本无法击中。但命运不是全知全能的，在测试敌人之前不会知道这一点。一旦它未能击中，它就不会再攻击同一个敌人。",
	"Time is something of the hypocrite among the Inexorables, perfectly happy to speed things up for itself while denying that same ability to anyone else. Many of the Inexorables don't mind if their allies bend the rules so long as their enemies toe the line, and if this seems like commentary on the nature of law and how it tends to be applied, of course it is. Or is it? Maybe it's the opposite.": "在Inexorables中，时间是个伪君子，它完全乐于为自己加速，而拒绝为其他人提供同样的能力。许多Inexorables不介意他们的盟友违反规则，只要他们的敌人遵守规则，如果这似乎是对法律的性质和如何应用法律的评论，当然是这样。或者是这样吗？也许恰恰相反。",
	"Time enforces the rules of causality and ensures the past remains firmly behind the future in spite of attempts by creatures like the elves to muddy the waters. The Inexorable of Time really doesn't like elves, by the way. The elves have an annoying habit of ignoring causality altogether.": "时间强制执行因果关系的规则，并确保过去牢牢地跟在未来后面，尽管像精灵这样的生物试图搅浑水。顺便说一句，时间的不可抗拒性真的不喜欢精灵。精灵们有一个恼人的习惯，就是完全无视因果关系。",
	"Time prevents enemies from taking bonus actions or reactions, which is very useful for players who want to maneuver around enemies without suffering attacks of opportunity. Like most of the Knights of Axiom, Time lacks ranged weapons and thus is barely effective against flying enemies, but if its target is on the ground, it is going to pummel the thing into oblivion. Between Haste and Time Is Inexorable, Time can act many times, moving around enemies while denying them opportunity attacks, and it can attack seven times! Time prefers to focus on those enemies benefitting from Haste or who act on turns other than their own. And elves, of course.": "时间可以阻止敌人采取额外的行动或反应，这对那些想在敌人身边周旋而不遭受机会攻击的玩家非常有用。像大多数公理骑士一样，\"时间 \"缺乏远程武器，因此对飞行的敌人几乎没有效果，但如果它的目标是在地面上，它就会把那东西打得稀巴烂。在Haste和Time Is Inexorable之间，Time可以多次行动，在敌人周围移动，同时剥夺他们的攻击机会，它可以攻击七次！它的攻击力是很强的。时间更喜欢专注于那些受益于急速的敌人，或者在他们自己的回合之外采取行动的敌人。当然，还有精灵。",
	"Chief amongst the Knights of Axiom is Nature. The Law of Nature states that all actions must proceed according to the fundamental axioms of the universe.. Magic is a tool used by those who would bypass those laws and act on the world using their will alone. This cannot be permitted. Nature can reflexively attempt to counter a spell as it's being cast, pointing at the caster and bellowing, \"OBEY!\" or \"CONFORM!\"": "公理骑士中最主要的是自然法则。自然法则指出，所有行动都必须按照宇宙的基本公理进行。魔法是那些想绕过这些法则，仅凭自己的意志对世界采取行动的人使用的一种工具。这是不允许的。自然可以在施法时反射性地试图反击，指着施法者并吼道：\"服从！\"或 \"顺应！\"",
	"Nature has no particular interest in the local phenomenon humans call \"nature.\" Plants and streams and such. To the Inexorables, \"Nature\" is stars and elementary particles. The world Men inhabit is messy but legal as far as the Inexorables are concerned. Until someone starts using magic.": "大自然对人类称之为 \"自然 \"的局部现象没有特别兴趣。植物和溪流之类的。对Inexorables来说，\"自然 \"是星星和基本粒子。人类居住的世界是混乱的，但在Inexorables看来是合法的。直到有人开始使用魔法。",
	"Nature's counterspell reaction has a range of 60 feet, so Nature can pummel easy-to-reach enemies while keeping tabs on enemy wizards and denying them their spells. Nature also abhors creatures who travel to other planes under their own power, especially fiends and members of the Court of All Flesh, whom the Inexorables hate above all others.": "大自然的反咒反应的范围是60英尺，所以大自然可以打击容易接近的敌人，同时监视敌人的巫师，不让他们施法。大自然也憎恨那些以自己的力量前往其他星球的生物，尤其是魔人和万物之灵的成员，Inexorables对他们恨之入骨。",

I knew Chris and Brad played board games and roleplaying games, and I wanted in.": "1985年，我15岁，是赛普拉斯高中的二年级学生，这一年我在计算机科学课上与布拉德-托马斯和克里斯-斯蒂尔一起讨论埃里克和黑公司以及不朽的化身。他们是校外的朋友，是一个更大的团体的一部分，但我仍然和我在公寓楼里长大的孩子们一起玩耍。我知道克里斯和布拉德玩棋盘游戏和角色扮演游戏，我想加入。",
	"At the end of the school year I signed their yearbooks: \"If you guys get together to play games, give me a call.\" They did. About thirty seconds later, they were my best friends. It changed my life.": "学年结束时，我在他们的年鉴上签名。\"如果你们聚在一起玩游戏，给我打个电话。\" 他们照做了。大约三十秒后，他们成为我最好的朋友。这改变了我的生活。",
	"We spent that summer playing board games and RPGs and going to the mall, and the arcade, and hanging out at the pool. It's a time and place that has now been immortalized and paid homage to in popular fiction. When I want to connect with my mother's formative years, I watch {@i American Graffiti}, filmed one town over from where she grew up. Folks looking for that same experience for my generation's formative years watch {@i Stranger Things}. It was easy for an adult back then watching us sitting around Dave Miles' pool table rolling strange dice, listening to Rush, and pretending to be elves to imagine we were wasting our time. And not just adults, a lot of our peers felt the same way. But I never did. I knew something worthwhile and remarkable would come out of the hobby: a lifetime of creativity and memories and shared experiences doing something amazing with my friends whom I loved. You don't need YouTube or Kickstarter, it's reward enough just ending up at the end of your life being able to look back on the worlds you created and shared with your friends and the heroic adventures you undertook. The hobby isn't a means to an end, it is an end unto itself. And while the places and events and people and things we create and meet in our secondary worlds are not real, one thing is.": "我们在那个夏天玩棋盘游戏和RPG游戏，去商场和电玩城，并在游泳池闲逛。这是一个现在已经在流行小说中被不朽和致敬的时间和地点。当我想与我母亲的成长岁月联系起来时，我就看{@i American Graffiti}，该片是在她长大的地方的一个小镇上拍摄的。人们想为我们这一代人的成长岁月寻找同样的体验，就会看{@i Stranger Things}。对于当时的成年人来说，看着我们坐在戴夫-迈尔斯的台球桌旁，掷着奇怪的骰子，听着拉什的歌，假装成精灵，很容易想象我们是在浪费时间。不仅仅是成年人，我们的很多同龄人都有同样的感觉。但我从未这样做过。我知道这个爱好会带来一些有价值的、了不起的东西：一生的创造力和记忆，以及与我所爱的朋友们一起做一些了不起的事情的共同经历。你不需要YouTube或Kickstarter，只要在你的生命结束时，能够回顾你创造的世界并与你的朋友分享，以及你所进行的英雄般的冒险，就已经是足够的奖励了。爱好不是达到目的的手段，它本身就是一个目的。虽然我们在第二世界中创造和遇到的地方、事件、人和事都不是真实的，但有一件事是真实的。",
	"Dreams are not real. Nothing that happens in a dream is real. With one exception. Chris Nolan wrote a whole movie about it.": "梦是不真实的。在梦中发生的一切都不是真实的。只有一个例外。克里斯-诺兰为此写了一整部电影。",
	"{@i Inception} takes place in dreams but it's about movies. It argues that while all these people and places and events are not real, something in film is. The emotions you feel watching a movie are real. That's what gives them meaning and value. When I watch Casablanca I fall in love with Ilsa every time. Generations of kids watched {@i The Adventures of Robin Hood} and ran outside play-swordfighting. Because the emotions you feel at the movies are real. Inception is using dreams to make a point about movies. And, I argue, RPGs.": "{@i Inception}发生在梦中，但它是关于电影的。它认为，虽然所有这些人、地方和事件都不是真实的，但电影中的东西却是真实的。你看电影所感受到的情感是真实的。这就是赋予它们的意义和价值。当我看《卡萨布兰卡》时，我每次都爱上了伊尔莎。一代又一代的孩子们看了{@i The Adventures of Robin Hood}，跑到外面玩耍-斗剑。因为你在电影中感受到的情感是真实的。盗梦空间》是用梦境来表达对电影的看法。而且，我认为，RPG也是如此。",
	"Don't let anyone tell you the hobby is a waste of time. Tell your friends you're going to get together and play tonight. Tell them you're going to do something real.": "不要让任何人告诉你这个爱好是浪费时间的。告诉你的朋友你今晚要聚在一起玩。告诉他们你要去做一些真正的事情。",

	"Once upon a time in the dim days of the hobby known as the 1970s, the game assumed you played until you were about 7th level and then built a stronghold. There were no rules for this, nor was any reason given for why the player or their character might want to do such a thing.": "很久以前，在被称为20世纪70年代的爱好的昏暗日子里，游戏假定你玩到7级左右，然后建立一个据点。对此没有任何规则，也没有给出任何理由说明为什么玩家或他们的角色可能想做这样的事情。",
	"For those original players, building a stronghold was a {@i self-evident good}. It was just neat, and they assumed it would be obvious why you would want to do such a thing. It meant your character was now interested in things besides killing orcs and acquiring gold. Treasure was a means to an end. As your character grew in power, they became more concerned with the state of the world. There were political conflicts and armies and incursions from other dimensions, and a single fighter with a sword, even a very nice sword with its own personality and special purpose, was not enough. You needed an army, or new spells, or extraplanar allies.": "对于那些最初的玩家来说，建立一个据点是一个（%0%）。它只是很整洁，而且他们认为你为什么要做这样的事情是很明显的。这意味着你的角色现在除了杀兽人和获得金币之外，还对其他事情感兴趣。宝藏是达到目的的一种手段。随着你的角色权力的增长，他们变得更加关心世界的状况。有政治冲突，有军队，有来自其他空间的入侵，一个拿着剑的战士，即使是一把有自己个性和特殊用途的非常好的剑，也是不够的。你需要一支军队，或新的法术，或星外盟友。",
	"The game transitioned from local problems to national problems, to global problems. Eventually, your 7th-level character fought a few wars or invented a spell or two, and then retired. Typically around 13th level. And that was it. The game had an end.": "游戏从地方问题过渡到国家问题，再到全球问题。最终，你的七级角色打了几场战争或发明了一两个法术，然后就退休了。通常是在13级左右。就这样了。游戏已经结束了。",
	"This book seeks to recreate that style of play, but in a modern sense, by giving the players reasons to build strongholds. And we got a lotta reasons. 😃": "本书试图重现这种游戏风格，但在现代意义上，通过给玩家提供建造据点的理由。我们有很多的理由。😃",
	"In this book you will find rules for four types of strongholds: {@book keeps|SaF|3} help you raise armies and improve your fighting ability, {@book temples|SaF|5} help you summon extraplanar allies to aid you in battle, {@book towers|SaF|4} let you research new spells, and {@book establishments|SaF|6} let you collect secrets and generate cash.": "在这本书中，你可以找到四种据点的规则：{@book keeps|SaF|3}帮助你组建军队并提高你的战斗力，{@book temples|SaF|5}帮助你召唤星外盟友来帮助你作战，{@book towers|SaF|4}让你研究新的法术，{@book establishments|SaF|6}让你收集秘密并产生现金。",
	"Every stronghold also improves your signature class feature, powering up your Bardic Inspiration or your monk's Ki. Strongholds grant {@b improved class features} because they draw power from the land itself.": "每个要塞都能提高你的标志性等级特征，增强你的吟游诗人灵感或僧侣的气力。堡垒赋予（%0%），因为它们从土地本身汲取力量。",
	"The local area around your stronghold is called your {@b demesne} (deh-MAIN). Within your demesne, your character is now, if not ruler, certainly a very important person, so the power of the land manifests itself in unusual ways in your favor.": "你的据点周围的地方被称为你的（%0%）（deh-MAIN）。在你的领地内，你的角色现在即使不是统治者，也肯定是一个非常重要的人，所以土地的力量以不寻常的方式表现出来，对你有利。",
	"Building a stronghold also inspires people, allowing you to {@b attract followers} by rolling on a chart specific to your class. These followers could be mercenary legions or artisan peasants, foreign ambassadors or fellow adventuring heroes!": "建立据点还可以激励人们，让你通过在特定于你的等级的图表上滚动来（%0%）。这些追随者可以是佣兵军团或工匠农民，也可以是外国大使或冒险英雄的同伴！这些追随者可以是佣兵军团或工匠农民。",
	"Large-scale actions taken by your new army, your stronghold, or your followers sometimes take {@b months or seasons}. Also, your new abilities eventually run out of juice, after which you must return to your demesne to refresh yourself. This is called an {@b extended rest}.": "你的新军队、你的据点或你的追随者所采取的大规模行动有时会花费{@b months or seasons}。另外，你的新能力最终会耗尽，之后你必须回到你的领地来刷新自己。这被称为{@b extended rest}。",
	"To support these new options, the book comes with many new systems, including rules for {@book warfare|SaF|10}, in which units of soldiers clash; rules for {@b concordance}, which allows any character to plead with their deity for aid; rules for {@b creating new magic items}; and rules for taking your {@b retainers|SaF} with you into combat without having to run an entire second character.": "为了支持这些新的选择，本书配备了许多新的系统，包括{@book warfare|SaF|10}的规则，其中士兵单位发生冲突；{@b concordance}的规则，允许任何角色向他们的神灵恳求援助；{@b creating new magic items}的规则；以及将你的{@b retainers|SaF}带入战斗而不必运行整个第二个角色的规则。",
	"Talk to your GM to make sure these new rules are allowed in their game. This book asks a lot of your GM, they are expected to:": "请与你的GM商量，确保这些新规则在他们的游戏中是被允许的。这本书对你的GM提出了很多要求，他们被期望。",
	"Run NPC followers, including complex and powerful special allies.": "运行NPC追随者，包括复杂而强大的特殊盟友。",
	"Figure out which neighbors are happy or upset with your growing power in the local area.": "弄清楚哪些邻居对你在当地日益增长的力量感到高兴或不安。",
	"Make combat harder, to compensate for your new combat abilities.": "增加战斗难度，以弥补你的新战斗能力。",
	"That's a lot of work and your GM may have different plans for their game. They might be okay with some of these rules, but not others!": "这是一个很大的工作，你的总经理可能对他们的游戏有不同的计划。他们可能对其中一些规则没有意见，但对另一些规则就没有意见了",
	"This book references alignment a lot—don't freak out. It's merely deployed as an organizational tool. A fun way of saying \"allied\" or \"opposed.\" And a way to categorize allies and monsters dramatically. Paladins oppose chaos and evil, clerics embody good; these are just cool ways of referring to the forces opposing or allied with the heroes.": "这本书提到了很多对齐方式--不要吓坏了。它只是作为一种组织工具被使用。这是一种有趣的说法，即 \"结盟 \"或 \"反对 \"的方式。也是对盟友和怪物进行显著分类的一种方式。圣骑士反对混乱和邪恶，牧师体现了善；这些只是指反对英雄或与英雄结盟的力量的很酷的方式。",
	"Feel free to recontextualize these references however you like. If you're playing a...lawful neutral paladin, perhaps opposing chaos is more important or useful to you than good or evil. Or maybe alignment isn't useful at all, in which case the player and the GM can agree to use \"allied\" or \"opposed.\" Alignment was originally invented as an excuse to yell at players who were backstabbing other players by inventing \"teams\" and requiring them to pick \"our team\" if they were going to continue playing, so best not to take it too seriously.": "你可以随心所欲地对这些参考文献进行重新编排。如果你扮演的是一个......合法中立的圣骑士，也许对你来说反对混乱比善或恶更重要或更有用。或者，也许结盟根本就没有用，在这种情况下，玩家和GM可以同意使用 \"结盟 \"或 \"反对\"。结盟最初是作为一个借口被发明出来的，用来吼叫那些通过发明 \"团队 \"并要求他们选择 \"我们的团队 \"来继续游戏的玩家，所以最好不要把它看得太重。",
	"It's cool to have a place of your own. A headquarters, a base. A castle, a tower, a keep.": "有一个属于自己的地方是很好的。一个总部，一个基地。一座城堡，一座塔，一座堡垒。",
	"It would be even better if your headquarters {@i did} something cool for you. Gave you some useful ability, preferably in combat, since that's where a lot (not all!) of the game happens. It's certainly where the life and death stuff happens.": "如果你的总部（%0%）为你提供一些很酷的东西，那就更好了。给你一些有用的能力，最好是在战斗中，因为那是游戏中很多（不是全部！）发生的地方。这当然是生死攸关的事情发生的地方。",
	"It's also nice to have a reason to hoard money. Delving deep into dark dungeons promises three rewards: experience, magic items, and {@i money}.": "有一个囤积金钱的理由也很好。深入黑暗的地牢会带来三种奖励：经验、魔法物品和（%0%）。",
	"Experience is a self-evident good, as it makes your character level up and gain power.": "经验是一种不言而喻的好处，因为它使你的角色等级提高，获得力量。",
	"Magic items, likewise. They let you do cool things your character would never normally be able to do.": "同样，魔法物品也是如此。它们可以让你做你的角色通常无法做到的酷事。",
	"Money, though? What are we supposed to do with it? At least one edition granted players easy access to creating magic items, a fine way to spend your money. A side effect of this is the assumed presence of shops in sufficiently large cities where you can buy magic items.": "不过，钱呢？我们应该用它做什么呢？至少有一个版本赋予玩家创造魔法物品的便利，这是一种花钱的好方法。这样做的一个副作用是，在足够大的城市中假定存在着可以购买魔法物品的商店。",
	"But the modern edition makes the opposite assumption. Players during the 5E playtest said they wanted magic to be rare, and the dev team listened. Magic is rare and \"magic shoppes\" are not assumed in the base game.": "但现代版却做出了相反的假设。在5E游戏测试期间，玩家们说他们希望魔法是稀有的，而开发团队听从了。魔法是罕见的，\"魔法商店 \"在基本游戏中没有被假定。",
	"Strongholds and their upgrades, therefore, give you a good reason to save your money.": "因此，堡垒和它们的升级，给了你一个很好的理由来节省你的钱。",
	"There are four types of basic stronghold, one complex stronghold, and many varieties. Any character can build or use any stronghold, although why a non-spellcasting character might build a tower is an exercise left to the reader. Maybe they have a spellcasting NPC ally!": "有四种类型的基本据点，一种复杂的据点，以及许多种类。任何角色都可以建造或使用任何据点，尽管为什么非法术角色会建造一座塔是留给读者的一个练习。也许他们有一个会法术的NPC盟友！\"。",
	"A {@book keep|SaF|3} is a martial stronghold for characters interested in raising armies and defending the local townsfolk. Barbarian camps and pirate ships are variations on this.": "A{@book keep|SaF|3}是一个武术据点，供有兴趣组建军队和保卫当地乡亲的角色使用。野蛮人营地和海盗船是其变种。",
	"A {@book tower|SaF|4} is an arcane stronghold for doing spell research and learning battle magic.": "A（%0%）是一个奥术据点，用于进行法术研究和学习战斗魔法。",
	"A {@book temple|SaF|5} is a divine stronghold for summoning extraplanar allies and learning battle magic. A druid's grove is a popular variation.": "一个{@book temple|SaF|5}是一个神圣的据点，用于召唤星外盟友和学习战斗魔法。德鲁伊的小树林是一个流行的变体。",
	"An {@book establishment|SaF|6} is an espionage stronghold for sabotaging your enemies and generating revenue.": "一个{@book establishment|SaF|6}是一个间谍据点，用于破坏你的敌人和创造收入。",
	"A {@book castle|SaF|2|Castles: Complex Strongholds} combines two or more of the above into a larger complex owned and run by multiple characters, each of whom can gain the mechanical benefits thereof.": "A {@book castle|SaF|2|Castles: Complex Strongholds}将上述两个或更多的项目组合成一个更大的综合体，由多个角色拥有和经营，每个角色都可以获得其中的机械利益。",
	"Ultimately, the idea that there are four kinds of strongholds (and some variations of each) is completely arbitrary. You could easily have six kinds, or one for each class. Or no \"types,\" just different abilities to buy a la carte. But I find these four get us 90% of what we need, with their variations getting us another 9%. And for those players who want a stronghold not listed here, hopefully the variations are sufficient to help the GM come up with a unique variant without much work.": "归根结底，有四种据点（以及每种据点的一些变化）的想法是完全随意的。你可以很容易地有六种，或者每个等级都有一种。或者没有 \"类型\"，只是有不同的能力，可以自选购买。但我发现这四种可以满足我们90%的需要，而它们的变体可以让我们得到另外9%的东西。对于那些想要这里没有列出的据点的玩家来说，希望这些变化足以帮助GM想出一个独特的变化，而不需要太多的工作。",
	"There are three basic ways for the party to acquire a stronghold: they are (in order of most expensive to least expensive) build a new one, renovate an old one, or receive one from a local noble.": "党有三种获得据点的基本方式：它们是（按照从最贵到最便宜的顺序）建造一个新的据点，改造一个旧的据点，或者从当地贵族那里得到一个据点。",
	"The cost (in gold) and time to build (in days) for each of the four strongholds are listed below. These are not based on any historical numbers mostly because humans were building castles for about 600 years until the invention of gunpowder made them obsolete and there's no reasonable way to translate those costs into a fantasy game. But even were we to pick a historical period as our baseline, there was no time in history that had bands of wizards and warlocks roaming the countryside pillaging dragon hordes and coming back to civilization with tens of thousands of gold pieces.": "下面列出了四个据点的成本（以金币计）和建造时间（以天计）。这些不是基于任何历史数字，主要是因为人类建造城堡的时间大约为600年，直到火药的发明使其过时，而且没有合理的方法将这些成本转化为一个幻想的游戏。但是，即使我们选择一个历史时期作为我们的基准，历史上也没有出现过巫师和术士的队伍在乡间游荡，掠夺龙群并带着数万枚金币回到文明社会的情况。",
	"Therefore any costs we derive must first be based in the economies of a fantasy RPG. And that means they must cost a lot, but not take too long. If it takes 10 years to build your stronghold, no PC would ever do it. Keeps and towers, temples and establishments each have wildly different purposes with different costs and different times to build.": "因此，我们得出的任何成本必须首先基于幻想RPG的经济。这意味着它们必须花费很多，但不会花费太长时间。如果要花10年时间来建造你的据点，没有一个人愿意这么做。堡垒和塔楼、寺庙和机构的目的大不相同，建造成本和时间也不同。",
	"{@book Keeps|SaF|3} are larger and more fortified for defensive purposes and therefore take longer to build: 150 days.": "{@book Keeps|SaF|3}的规模更大，防御性更强，因此需要更长的时间来建造。150天。",
	"{@book Temples|SaF|4} and {@book towers|SaF|5} are less fortified but still usually made of stone and take 120 days to complete at 1st level.": "{@book Temples|SaF|4}和{@book towers|SaF|5}的强化程度较低，但通常仍由石头制成，一级时需要120天才能完成。",
	"An {@b establishment} serves no defensive purpose, typically existing within a town or city with its own fortifications. But your establishment is still well-constructed with basements, multiple floors, and probably secret passages for you and your allies to escape out of...or in to! They take 90 days to complete.": "一个{@b establishment}没有防御作用，通常存在于一个有自己防御工事的城镇或城市中。但你的机构仍然有很好的结构，有地下室、多层，可能还有秘密通道供你和你的盟友逃出......或逃入！他们需要90天完成。它们需要90天才能完成。",
	"Keeps, towers, and temples also count as Fortifications in Warfare (see page 231 for the rules on Warfare). These fortifications grant Morale bonuses to the soldiers defending them in battle. They also have a Size representing the die used to track damage done to them, and a Toughness rating representing how hard they are to damage. Because they don't attack, they have no Attack, Defense, or Power ratings.": "堡垒、塔楼和寺庙也算作战争中的防御工事（见第231页的战争规则）。这些防御工事会给在战斗中保卫它们的士兵带来士气上的奖励。它们也有一个尺寸，代表用来追踪对它们造成的伤害的骰子，还有一个坚韧等级，代表它们受伤害的难易程度。因为它们不进行攻击，所以它们没有攻击、防御或力量等级。",
	"+2 Morale per level": "每一级的士气+2",
	"Tower": "塔楼",
	"+1 Morale per level": "每级+1士气",
	"Temple": "寺庙",
	"Establishment": "设立",
	"Once built, your stronghold can be upgraded by taking more time and spending more money, as shown on the charts on the previous page. You can spend more money to build a larger stronghold from the start, but there is no time or cost savings.": "一旦建成，你的据点可以通过花更多的时间和花更多的钱来升级，如上页的图表所示。你可以花更多的钱从一开始就建造一个更大的据点，但并不节省时间和成本。",
	"A stronghold belongs to whoever pays for it, and they are its master. If Cail the Wizard builds a tower, he gets to decide who gains its benefits. He may allow his sorcerer or warlock pals to do spell research there... until one or both betrays him! Or he, them! Only one character can gain the benefit of a given stronghold at a time, and each character can only benefit from one stronghold ability at a time.": "一个据点属于谁，谁就为它付钱，他们就是它的主人。如果巫师凯尔建造了一座塔，他就可以决定谁能得到它的好处。他可以允许他的巫师或术士伙伴在那里进行法术研究......直到有一个或两个人背叛了他！或者他，他们！\"。或者是他，他们! 每次只有一个角色可以从一个给定的据点中获得好处，而且每个角色一次只能从一个据点的能力中获益。",
	"If multiple characters chip in to pay for a stronghold—or one character just spends a lot of money—it is a castle and provides multiple benefits. Complex tasks take proportionally more time and money than simple ones, so a castle costs 10% more and takes 10% longer for every basic stronghold function it incorporates.": "如果多个角色为一个据点出资，或者一个角色只是花了很多钱，那么它就是一座城堡，并提供多种好处。复杂的任务比简单的任务需要按比例花费更多的时间和金钱，因此，一座城堡的每项基本据点功能都要多花费10%的时间和精力。",
	"Jess, Anna, and Lars decide to pitch in together and buy a castle. It will contain a keep, a temple, and a tower. It will cost 33,800 gp and take 507 days. That's 10,000 gp for the keep and 8,000 gp each for the tower and temple, 150 days for the keep and 120 days each for the temple and tower. Then an extra 30% on top (multiply time and cost each by 1.3) to account for the extra work necessary to incorporate many functions in one structure.": "杰斯、安娜和拉斯决定一起投钱，买下一座城堡。它将包含一座堡垒、一座神庙和一座塔。它将花费33,800金币，需要507天。这意味着10,000金币用于建造堡垒，8,000金币用于建造塔和庙，150天用于建造堡垒，120天用于建造庙和塔。然后在此基础上再增加30%（时间和成本各乘以1.3），以考虑到在一个结构中加入许多功能所需的额外工作。",
	"A castle cannot contain multiple of the same type of stronghold. If you build a castle with two towers, for instance, only one of them grants the benefits of spell research. Also, a stronghold's benefit only applies to one character at a time. A character can switch between which stronghold benefits they receive by taking an {@book extended rest|SaF|2} (page 15).": "一座城堡不能包含多个相同类型的据点。例如，如果你建造了一座有两座塔的城堡，那么只有其中一座可以获得法术研究的好处。另外，一个据点的好处在同一时间只适用于一个角色。一个角色可以通过服用{@book extended rest|SaF|2}(第15页)来切换他们获得的据点利益。",
	"The purpose of the design is, on the one hand, to somewhat model the real world where building a movie theater and automotive plant in the same building would (one assumes) take longer than the time to build each separately. For one thing the different kinds of strongholds have different requirements and therefore it takes more and different kinds of workers to complete them and the more workers you have the harder it is to coordinate them all.": "设计的目的一方面是为了在某种程度上模拟现实世界，在同一建筑中建造电影院和汽车厂，（人们假设）要比分别建造的时间长。一方面，不同种类的据点有不同的要求，因此需要更多不同种类的工人来完成，而且工人越多，就越难协调他们。",
	"But also, one goal of these rules is to give players things to do in their {@b downtime}, and this is a period for individual goals and initiative. Usually when one of my players builds a stronghold, everyone hangs out there.": "但同时，这些规则的一个目标是让玩家在他们的{@b downtime}里有事情可做，这是一个个人目标和主动性的时期。通常情况下，当我的一个玩家建立了一个据点，每个人都会在那里闲逛。",
	"All the Avengers hang out at Avenger's Mansion but at the end of the day, Tony Stark built that place and it and Jarvis answer to him and when things go wrong he's on the hook for it.": "所有的复仇者都在复仇者大厦玩耍，但在一天结束时，托尼-斯塔克建造了那个地方，它和贾维斯都对他负责，当事情出错时，他要为此负责。",
	"Finally, don't presume that just because you as a player think it would be a good idea for \"all of us\" to build a stronghold together, that everyone else at the table agrees. In my experience, one or two players may agree, one or two players won't care, but one or two players actually have their own ideas about what should be done with what they perceive as \"their share of the treasure.\" Make sure you've polled the electorate and listen to what they say. Folks who disagree often keep their mouths shut just to avoid conflict, and this is a great recipe for breeding unhappy players.": "最后，不要以为你作为一个玩家认为 \"我们所有人 \"一起建造一个据点是个好主意，就认为桌子上的其他人都会同意。根据我的经验，有一两个玩家可能会同意，有一两个玩家不会在意，但有一两个玩家实际上对他们认为的 \"他们那份财宝 \"应该怎么做有自己的想法。请确保你已经对选民进行了调查，并听取他们的意见。不同意的人经常闭口不谈，只是为了避免冲突，而这是滋生不快乐的玩家的一个好办法。",
	"Since building or repairing any stronghold requires a labor force, it's reasonable for players to conclude that hiring more artisans and laborers will speed up the process!": "由于建造或修复任何据点都需要劳动力，所以玩家有理由得出结论，雇佣更多的工匠和工人会加快这一过程！这就是为什么我们要在这里建立一个据点。",
	"To a small degree this is true, but the rules assume your workers are working optimally, so adding more laborers will, paradoxically, cause it to take longer. This is a fact as well-documented as it is oft-ignored. The famous (real-world) book {@b The Mythical Man-Month} details exactly what happens: Beyond a certain point, the larger your network, the more management it requires, the more communication it takes for everyone involved, and the harder it becomes for any single worker to find the answer to their question, get a task approved, or get unblocked (or even know who's blocking them) on a process.": "在很小的程度上这是真的，但规则假定你的工人是在最佳状态下工作的，所以增加更多的劳动者，矛盾的是，会导致花费更长的时间。这是一个有据可查的事实，因为它经常被忽视。著名的（现实世界）书（%0%）详细说明了所发生的情况。超过某一点，你的网络越大，就需要更多的管理，每个人都需要更多的沟通，任何一个工人就越难找到他们问题的答案，得到任务的批准，或者在一个进程中得到解封（或者甚至知道谁在阻挡他们）。",
	"Therefore, we assume the times represent a group of workers getting the job done in a reasonably fast manner and that adding more people to the team would just complicate things.": "因此，我们假设这些时间代表了一群工人以合理的方式快速完成工作，增加更多的人加入团队只会使事情变得复杂。",
	"Of course, what seems reasonable to me may seem wildly unreasonable to you! Each GM's campaign is different, and different in ways that cannot be predicted or detected by any given designer.": "当然，在我看来合理的东西，在你看来可能是非常不合理的 每个GM的活动都是不同的，而且不同的方式是任何特定的设计者都无法预测或检测的。",
	"Therefore, feel absolutely free to charge your players more or less, or speed up or slow down the time it takes to fit both your idea of what's reasonable, and the precedents you've established for your game. To make these decisions seem less like GM fiat and ground them in the rules and your game, consider the following.": "因此，你完全可以向你的玩家收取更多或更少的费用，或者加快或减慢所需的时间，以适应你对什么是合理的想法，以及你为游戏建立的先例。为了使这些决定看起来不那么像GM的命令，并将它们建立在规则和你的游戏中，请考虑以下几点。",
	"Strongholds take more or less time to construct based on the availability of local workers. Maybe recent events in your campaign have made laborers and artisans scarce or plentiful! Whatever local problem the players have recently dealt with, it may have scared many valuable workers away from the area (strongholds take more time). Or, with that problem solved, maybe more workers are available and willing to help our stalwart heroes (strongholds take less time)!": "堡垒的建造时间取决于当地工人的可用性。也许在你的战役中，最近发生的事件使工人和工匠变得稀少或丰富！无论玩家最近处理的是什么地方的问题，都可能把许多有价值的工人吓跑了（据点需要更多时间）。无论玩家最近处理了什么地方的问题，都可能把许多有价值的工人从该地区吓跑了（据点需要更多时间）。或者，随着问题的解决，可能会有更多的工人愿意帮助我们坚毅的英雄（据点需要更少的时间）。",
	"Strongholds may cost more if the local area turns out to be resource poor. It takes wood and stone to make a stronghold, and not just any wood or stone.": "如果当地的资源匮乏，要塞的成本可能会更高。建造一个据点需要木材和石头，而且不是任何木材或石头。",
	"\"Can't build from this,\" Arranel the Woodwright says, shaking her head. \"Trees are all beech round here. Can't make a proper truss or scaffold with beech. No block or tackle neither. Rope'll chew right through it.\"": "\"不能用这个建造，\"木匠Arranel说，摇摇头。\"这里的树木都是山毛榉树。用山毛榉做不了一个合适的桁架或脚手架。也没有木块或钓具。绳子会把它咬断的。\"",
	"\"And the stone here's all got lime running through it. Water table's just a few feet down, I reckon,\" Galder of Chalk, the stonemason observes. \"Gonna have to send to Rest to get some proper granite. Cost a pretty penny, that.\"": "\"这里的石头都有石灰流过。我估计，地下水位就在几英尺以下。\"石匠高德观察到。\"我得派人到雷斯特去找一些合适的花岗岩。这可花了不少钱。\"",
	"So the costs may be more exorbitant than the rules imply. The reverse is also true!": "因此，费用可能比规则所暗示的要高得多。反过来也是如此!",
	"\"No gold, sorry to break it to you. Know you ratcatchers love comin' up gold. But plenty of iron,\" Zoran Steeleye, foreman of the mine, says. \"More'n enough to get you started on a proper keep.\"": "\"没有金子，抱歉打断你。我知道你们这些捕鼠者喜欢来找黄金。但有大量的铁，\"佐兰-斯蒂尔耶，矿场的领班，说。\"多到足以让你开始适当地保持。\"",
	"Circumstances both natural and political may conspire to make your campaign's costs different from these. Indeed, in some campaign worlds metal is as rare as...a very rare thing! And we might imagine a stronghold would be a very expensive proposition on that dead world under a black star.": "自然条件和政治条件都可能使你的竞选活动的成本与这些不同。事实上，在一些竞选世界中，金属就像......一种非常罕见的东西！而我们可以想象，在黑星下的死寂世界中，一个据点会非常昂贵。而我们可以想象，在黑星下的那个死寂的世界里，一个据点将是一个非常昂贵的提议。",
	"Keep in mind that a 1st-level keep is a simple motteand-bailey and would still appear to be \"under construction\" when it is actually done. It can act as a defensive stronghold well before it's pretty and all the finishing touches are complete. It may be hard to imagine Camelot being built in a little more than a year, but that's because the structure we imagine with pink walls and pennants flying is what you get long after the place was a functioning castle.": "请记住，一级堡垒是一个简单的堡垒，当它真正完成时，看起来仍然是 \"正在建造\"。它可以作为一个防御性的据点，在它漂亮和所有收尾工作完成之前。也许很难想象卡梅洛在一年多一点的时间里就建成了，但这是因为我们想象中粉墙黛瓦、彩旗飘飘的结构是在这个地方成为一个正常运作的城堡之后很长时间才得到的。",
	"There's no correct answer to this, it is entirely up to the GM. I've run games in which the PCs started at 1st level playing local nobles complete with strongholds and domains. I've run for groups who at 3rd level cleared out an overrun watchtower and claimed it as their base.": "这没有正确的答案，这完全取决于GM。我玩过的游戏中，NPC从1级开始扮演当地的贵族，并拥有据点和领地。我也曾为那些在3级时清理了一个被占领的瞭望塔并声称它是他们的基地的团体运行过。",
	"As the GM, you can simply decide it would be fun if the players started with or cleared out their own stronghold at low levels. One of the great moments in any campaign, for me, is just after the players de-orc a ruined keep and realize, \"Hey! We could make this place our base!\" This is the moment when the players start using the things they find in the world as their own resources. The world feels real to them. They are thinking about things besides killing monsters.": "作为GM，你可以简单地决定，如果玩家从低级别的据点开始或清理他们自己的据点，那会很有趣。对我来说，任何战役中最伟大的时刻之一，就是在玩家解除了一个废墟上的巫术后，意识到：\"嘿！我们可以把这个地方变成我们的基地！\" 这是玩家开始使用他们在这个世界上发现的东西作为自己的资源的时刻。这个世界对他们来说是真实的。除了杀怪之外，他们还在思考其他事情。",
	"Maybe the question is \"At what level can the PCs afford to build their own stronghold?\" That's easy to figure out. We start by imagining the players want to pool their money together to build a castle for 50,000 gold pieces.": "也许问题是 \"NPC在什么级别可以负担得起建造他们自己的据点？\" 这很容易搞清楚。我们先想象一下，玩家们想把他们的钱集中起来，用50,000个金币建造一座城堡。",
	"So we scrubbed through the published adventures to figure out: when would the characters be able to afford a keep? Well if they go through the official 5E Big Giant Adventure...the answer is surprising. By 6th level in the Big Giant Adventure, the players can have accumulated enough gold to buy a keep. Assuming they find all the gold and roll average on random results.": "因此，我们通过已出版的冒险故事来弄清楚：角色们什么时候才能买得起养鸡场？好吧，如果他们通过官方的5E大巨人冒险......答案是令人惊讶的。在《大巨人冒险》的第6层，玩家可以积累足够的金币来购买一个堡垒。假设他们找到了所有的金子，并在随机结果上进行平均滚动。",
	"In practice, however, it difficult to find all the gold in an adventure, especially adventures with sandbox elements, or branches. Different groups often come out with wildly different amounts of cash from the same adventure. 7th level, therefore, is a reasonable conclusion.": "然而，在实践中，很难在一次冒险中找到所有的黄金，特别是有沙盒元素的冒险，或分支。不同的小组往往从同一个冒险中得到的现金数量大不相同。因此，第七级是一个合理的结论。",
	"Different editions treat gold differently. Some classic 1st Edition adventures award many tens of thousands of gold at low levels (often in copper pieces, on purpose, to make the act of getting the gold back to civilization a challenge in itself). Some adventures have hardly any gold in them at all. Not only does this vary from edition to edition, it varies wildly from one adventure to another within an edition.": "不同的版本对待黄金的方式不同。一些经典的第一版冒险在低级别的时候就能获得数以万计的金币（通常是以铜块为单位，目的是使将金币带回文明的行为本身就是一种挑战）。有些冒险中几乎没有任何黄金。这不仅因版本而异，而且在一个版本中，不同的冒险也有很大的差异。",
	"Therefore, Game Masters who think \"my players will want a stronghold\" should make sure they dump enough gold on the players to make it possible. The gold you award becomes a knob you turn to adjust when exactly the players can afford a stronghold of their own. Assuming they need to buy the thing at all! There are other options!": "因此，认为 \"我的玩家会想要一个据点 \"的游戏管理员应该确保他们向玩家倾倒足够的金币以使其成为可能。你授予的金币成了一个旋钮，你可以转动它来调整玩家究竟何时能买得起自己的据点。假设他们需要买这个东西的话! 还有其他选择!",
	"As any druid worth their salt—or any other minerals—will tell you: nature is pretty aggressive. Without proper upkeep, roots and vines and weather will take their toll and in only a year a stronghold can require so much upkeep to get back in shape that it qualifies as a ruin. Practically, if the keep or tower or temple in your adventure has some crumbling walls and perhaps a few rooms or entire floor exposed to the elements, it is certainly a ruin.": "任何有价值的德鲁伊或其他矿物都会告诉你：大自然是相当有侵略性的。如果没有适当的维护，树根、藤蔓和天气就会造成损失，仅一年时间，一个据点就需要大量的维护来恢复原状，以至于它可以成为一个废墟。实际上，如果你的冒险中的堡垒或塔楼或寺庙有一些摇摇欲坠的墙壁，也许有几个房间或整个楼层暴露在大自然中，它肯定是一个废墟。",
	"{@b Repairing a ruin saves you half the time and cost of the final stronghold}. So repairing a ruined level 1 keep would only cost 5,000 gold and take 75 days.": "{@b Repairing a ruin saves you half the time and cost of the final stronghold}. 因此，修复一个被毁坏的1级堡垒只需花费5000金币，并需要75天。",
	"It's up to the GM to decide whether the ruin is a single-player stronghold or a castle that can serve as a complex that contains some combination of basic strongholds within.": "这取决于GM决定废墟是一个单人的据点，还是一个可以作为综合体的城堡，其中包含一些基本据点的组合。",
	"How badly ruined a stronghold is, is purely a judgement call by the GM, but here are some guidelines. If it has multiple levels with any intact rooms, {@b each level} saves another 500 gold in cost and 7 days off the total time. If it has any {@b wholly intact} levels, each level instead saves you 1,000 gp and 14 days.": "一个据点被毁的程度，纯粹是由GM来判断的，但这里有一些准则。如果它有多级，有任何完整的房间，{@b each level}可以再节省500金币的成本和7天的总时间。如果它有任何{@b wholly intact}层，每层反而可以节省1000金币和14天。",
	"If there are several (more than three, including a dungeon level) levels with intact rooms, then this is probably not a 1st-level stronghold. It could be a 2nd-level or 3rd-level stronghold! GMs, remember in your generosity that strongholds cap out at 5th level. Letting players repair a ruin so that they end up with a level 4 or 5 stronghold gives them immense power and little left to strive for.": "如果有几层（超过三层，包括地牢层）有完整的房间，那么这可能不是一级据点。它可能是一个2级或3级的据点。GM们，记住你们的慷慨，据点的上限是5级。让玩家修复一个废墟，使他们最终拥有一个4级或5级的据点，会给他们带来巨大的力量，但却没有什么可以争取的。",
	"Any local stronghold in good enough shape not to need repair actually belongs to someone. Legally. Some local noble. It might be currently overrun by orcs, or even sitting surrounded by forest overgrowth, forgotten. But as soon as the party clears it out, it becomes unforgotten and the local duke or queen says, \"Hey that's mine.\"": "任何状况良好、不需要修理的当地据点实际上都属于某人。在法律上。一些当地的贵族。它目前可能被兽人占领，甚至被森林杂草包围，被遗忘。但是一旦党派将其清除，它就会变得不被遗忘，当地的公爵或女王会说：\"嘿，那是我的。\"",
	"Nobles get really persnickety when a bunch of ratcatchers decide some stronghold in the noble's territory is \"theirs.\" The local nobles start to feel like maybe these itinerant campaigners are trying to muscle in on their cushy gig.": "当一群捕鼠者决定将贵族领地上的某个据点作为 \"他们的 \"时，贵族们就变得非常挑剔。当地的贵族们开始觉得，也许这些流动的竞选者正试图插手他们舒适的工作。",
	"At the same time, nobles are not stupid—though they may well be prideful, fearful, or full of hubris—so they might realize {@b any mercenary group powerful enough to clear out the orcs would serve better as subjects or allies than enemies}.": "同时，贵族并不愚蠢--尽管他们很可能是骄傲的、恐惧的或充满傲慢的--所以他们可能会意识到（%0%）。",
	"So {@i typically} the local noble will be very thankful and generous. A duke might nominate the most noble and trustworthy party member (favoring lawful good, or lawful, or the same alignment as the noble) and invest them as baron. Congratulations! You're a landed noble!": "所以（%0%）当地的贵族会非常感激和慷慨。公爵可能会提名最尊贵、最值得信赖的党员（倾向于合法的善，或合法的，或与贵族相同的排列），并将他们封为男爵。祝贺你！你是一个土地贵族。你是一个有土地的贵族!",
	"As democratic and egalitarian as the players may feel, unless your world is {@i wildly} different from a medieval society, the local noble won't be keen on the idea of an autonomous collective running a stronghold. The {@i players} may feel like they collectively saved the noble's forgotten stronghold for them, but the noble does not recognize \"an adventuring party\" as a legitimate form of government.": "尽管玩家们可能觉得很民主、很平等，但除非你的世界与中世纪社会有{@i wildly}的不同，否则当地的贵族不会热衷于让一个自治的集体来管理一个据点的想法。{@i players}的人可能会觉得他们集体为他们拯救了贵族的被遗忘的据点，但贵族并不承认 \"冒险党 \"是合法的政府形式。",
	"So while {@i many} PCs can enjoy the benefits of a castle (i.e. a complex stronghold, one that belongs to many characters) as far as local politics are concerned, {@i one} PC is responsible for it. When the local noble has a problem, it's that PC who's on the hook.": "因此，虽然{@i many}PC可以享受城堡（即一个复杂的据点，属于许多角色）的好处，就当地政治而言，{@i one}PC要对它负责。当当地的贵族有问题时，是那个PC在负责。",
	"Furthermore, the local noble can simply award the players a stronghold as payment for some service. \"Thank you for stopping that local death cult, here's the right and title to a small keep.\" Now, this may be exactly as it seems and the players just get a stronghold, no strings attached. Not very {@i dramatic} though, is it?": "此外，当地贵族可以简单地授予玩家一个据点作为某种服务的报酬。\"感谢你阻止了当地的死亡邪教，这是一个小堡垒的权利和所有权。\" 现在，这可能正是它看起来的那样，玩家只是得到一个据点，没有任何附加条件。但这不是很{@i dramatic}，是吗？",
	"In a situation like that, we expect there's some reason the stronghold is available to be awarded. Maybe it's a ruin, and there may be some costs associated with getting it up and running. Or it's full of goblins. Or...oozes! Yeah that sounds dramatic. A cult of Orcus! Good luck!": "在这样的情况下，我们希望这个据点有某种原因可以被授予。也许它是一个废墟，要让它运转起来可能会有一些费用。或者它充满了地精。或者是......渗出物！？是的，这听起来很戏剧化。一个奥库斯的邪教! 祝您好运!",
	"Ultimately the rule is there is {@i always} some \"cost.\" Either in gold or risk. Even a 100% no-strings-attached, no-orc-infestation stronghold will have required the players to do something incredibly risky beforehand, adventure-wise, to earn the local noble's favor.": "最终的规则是有（%0%）一些 \"成本\"。要么是黄金，要么是风险。即使是一个100%没有附加条件、没有兽人入侵的据点，也会要求玩家事先做一些风险极大的事情，从冒险的角度来说，以赢得当地贵族的青睐。",
	"Something I've enjoyed doing in my own campaign is putting a document granting right and title to a stronghold to whosoever holds the deed. This is, certainly, ahistorical...but it is dramatic!": "我在自己的活动中很喜欢做的事情是，把一份授予据点权利和所有权的文件交给持有契约的人。这当然是不符合历史的......但它是很有戏剧性的!",
	"This throws an interesting monkey wrench into the political landscape, since the dead king wrote this document and therefore technically all the local nobility must abide by it. But...is it really a good idea to have some murderhobos running the show over there?": "这给政治格局带来了一个有趣的麻烦，因为这个文件是死去的国王写的，因此从技术上讲，所有当地的贵族都必须遵守它。但是......让一些杀人狂在那里主持大局真的是个好主意吗？",
	"That kind of \"well yes this document says the keep is yours but I, and my army {@i really} want it\" conflict makes great drama! With lots of local powers lining up to see who they should ally with, who's going to be on the winning side of any future conflict.": "那种 \"嗯，是的，这份文件上说，这个地方是你的，但我和我的军队（百分之十）想要它 \"的冲突是很好的戏剧性的！很多地方势力都在排队，看看他们应该和谁结盟，谁会在未来的冲突中获胜。很多地方势力都在排队，看看他们应该与谁结盟，谁会在未来的冲突中成为胜利者。",
	"Generally, you'll want to assume that the PCs' actions have {@b unintended consequences}. When you build or buy or clear out a tower and make it yours, you make allies and enemies.

	"There is typically no cost here—the stronghold is a gift. The cost can be thought of as the risk to life and limb the players undertook. Though the local noble may gift the PCs a stronghold that needs some repair, that's pretty classic. The players imagine Greywall Keep as a Camelot-esque castle with pink walls and strict laws governing precipitation, but when they arrive they will discover the local noble was perhaps not as forthcoming with details as might be desired. Classic.": "这里通常没有成本--据点是一种礼物。成本可以被认为是玩家所承担的生命和肢体的风险。虽然当地的贵族可能会送给NPC一个需要修理的据点，但那是非常经典的。玩家将灰墙堡想象成一个有着粉红色墙壁和严格的法律管理沉淀物的卡米洛特式的城堡，但是当他们到达时，他们会发现当地的贵族也许并不像他们所希望的那样主动提供细节。经典。",
	"This is purely a tradition in my campaign, but as soon as the players begin getting a stronghold, I tell them outright: they can spend the money, and it will get built, but they don't gain the benefit of it until they defend it in battle, as described more in {@book Appendix Two: Warfare|SaF|10} (page 231). This is, usually, the first time the players have encountered the Warfare system, but so far over approximately six campaigns, the players have never balked at this condition, and so far they have always looked forward to the battle! Of course, your mileage may vary.": "这纯粹是我的战役中的一个传统，但玩家一开始得到一个据点，我就直截了当地告诉他们：他们可以花钱，据点也会被建起来，但他们要在战斗中保卫它才会获得好处，正如{@book Appendix Two: Warfare|SaF|10}（第231页）中更多描述的那样。这通常是玩家们第一次遇到战争系统，但到目前为止，在大约六次战役中，玩家们从未对这一条件表示过异议，而且到目前为止，他们总是期待着战斗的到来！当然，你的想法可能会有所不同。当然，你的里程可能会有所不同。",
	"The idea here is that raising the metaphorical flag and saying \"this place is mine\" sends a signal to local actors who heretofore took no notice of some low-level ratcatchers. But once you'd built a tower, keep, or temple, suddenly you're important enough to fear!": "这里的想法是，举起隐喻的旗帜，说 \"这个地方是我的\"，向当地的行动者发出信号，而这些行动者以前对一些低级的捕鼠者不屑一顾。但是，一旦你建造了一座塔、堡垒或寺庙，你就突然变得足够重要，足以让人畏惧！\"。",
	"Establishments attract less attention, certainly, but even building a new inn or tavern sends a signal, in which case it is the town itself, not the establishment that comes under attack. Better start building some walls!": "当然，机构吸引的注意力较少，但即使是建造一个新的旅馆或酒馆也会发出信号，在这种情况下，受到攻击的是城镇本身，而不是机构。最好开始建造一些墙!",
	"Strongholds grant special abilities, which quickly run out of uses and must be recharged by taking an {@b extended rest}. An extended rest requires spending a week at your stronghold, touching base with your subjects and followers, and attending to your affairs.": "堡垒赋予特殊能力，这些能力很快就会用完，必须通过服用{@b extended rest}来充能。延长休息时间需要在你的据点呆上一周，与你的臣民和追随者接触，并处理你的事务。",
	"This rule exists for a couple of reasons. First, it reinforces verisimilitude. It's unreasonable to expect a stronghold to grant its benefits indefinitely. A fighter who hasn't visited their keep in years is indistinguishable from a fighter without a stronghold!": "这一规则的存在有几个原因。首先，它加强了真实性。指望一个据点无限期地给予其利益是不合理的。一个多年未曾访问过他们的堡垒的战士与一个没有堡垒的战士是没有区别的。",
	"Second, they give players a good reason to return home and that grants you, the GM, the opportunity to advance the politics of your campaign. It's possible, {@i via sending} or a {@i diplomats} pouch or just mundane messengers on horseback, to advance your politics without visiting your stronghold and, indeed, some of this should be allowed, but major events and revelationsare better handled in person and, should war break out, a lord cannot command their troops from the bottom of a dungeon.": "第二，他们给了玩家一个回家的好理由，这就给了你，GM，一个推进你的活动的政治的机会。有可能，{@i via sending}或{@i diplomats}袋或只是骑在马背上的普通信使，在不访问你的据点的情况下推进你的政治，而且，确实应该允许一些这样的做法，但重大事件和启示最好亲自处理，而且，如果战争爆发，领主不能从地牢的底部指挥他们的部队。",
	"{@footnote {@b Strongholds unbalance the game}|I think 5E is the best-designed edition of the game, but I also think some players overfocus on \"balance\" because they feel the game is something to be \"solved.\" They expect a level of rigor more appropriate to a wargame or a card game.

It's fine to let your players get ahead of the power curve; you, the GM, have all the tools you need to challenge them. You have access to all the monsters, and you can make them nastier than usual.": "{@footnote {@b Strongholds unbalance the game}｜我认为5E是设计最好的游戏版本，但我也认为一些玩家过度关注 \"平衡\"，因为他们觉得游戏是需要 \"解决 \"的。他们期望的严格程度更适合于战争游戏或卡片游戏。我对RPG游戏没有这种期望。｝ 一个拥有完全升级的据点的圣骑士比没有据点的圣骑士可以获得更多的能力。这是在设计上。让你的玩家领先于力量曲线是没问题的；你，GM，有所有你需要的工具来挑战他们。你可以接触到所有的怪物，而且你可以让它们比平时更恶心。",
	"To help rebalance things, we give villains and their minions their own stronghold abilities that are less complex—and therefore easier for an already overburdened GM to use—than the stronghold abilities of the PCs. See \"Villain Strongholds\" on page 66.": "为了帮助重新平衡，我们给反派和他们的爪牙提供了他们自己的据点能力，这些能力没有那么复杂，因此对于已经负担过重的GM来说，更容易使用，而不是PC的据点能力。参见第66页的 \"小人的堡垒\"。",
	"Strongholds also represent a political framework. Many campaigns tick along nicely without anyone, including the GM, worrying about things like \"who's in charge here?\" Where \"here\" is \"this area of the map\" or \"this town\" or \"the area around the dungeon.\" This is perfectly fine; many successful campaigns have run for years without anyone needing to worry about this. These rules change those assumptions. Because a Stronghold is also a symbol of power, it threatens other local lords. Even if your players have no martial ambitions, if they attract a few units of light cavalry suddenly they will start wondering \"hey what can I do with these?\"": "堡垒也代表了一个政治框架。许多战役进行得很顺利，没有人，包括GM，担心诸如 \"谁负责这里 \"的问题。这里 \"是指 \"地图的这个区域 \"或 \"这个城镇 \"或 \"地牢周围的区域\"。这完全没有问题；许多成功的战役已经运行了多年，没有人需要担心这个问题。这些规则改变了这些假设。因为堡垒也是权力的象征，它可以威胁到其他地方的领主。即使你的玩家没有武功野心，如果他们吸引了几支轻骑兵部队，突然间他们会开始想：\"嘿，我能用这些做什么？\"",
	"So your world, if you use this book, slowly transforms into one where there are local powers. These \"powers\" are usually nobility, but they can be any characters with power and an army. A wizard with a tower may only have a small hamlet outside, and that hamlet has its own town council and the wizard doesn't bother them. But if the local Baron needs arcane assistance, it's this wizard he turns to. These nobles and powerful NPCs rule different areas, they have their own strongholds and armies and their own subjects who work for them and will fight with them.": "所以你的世界，如果你使用这本书，就会慢慢转变为一个有地方势力的世界。这些 \"权力 \"通常是贵族，但也可以是任何拥有权力和军队的人物。一个拥有高塔的巫师可能只在外面有一个小村庄，而那个小村庄有自己的镇议会，巫师不会打扰他们。但如果当地男爵需要奥术援助，他就会求助于这个巫师。这些贵族和强大的NPC统治着不同的地区，他们有自己的据点和军队，有自己的臣民为他们工作并会与他们一起战斗。",

	"So in general, building any kind of stronghold makes a statement. But a keep is a military fortification.

	"An organization is any collection of people who agree to common rules and hierarchy in order to further some agenda, goal, or philosophy.

	"Some organizations contain organizations of their own. A church may sponsor a secret order of knights. Spying on the church is easy—it's a big organization that operates out in the open.

In other words, if a player says, \"I think the Order of Five Stars is secretly in league with the baron,\" and they roll well, do not merely say, \"Yes that's true.\" That is deeply unsatisfying, since the player already suspected that.": "避免确认猜测。换句话说，如果玩家说：\"我认为五星会暗中与男爵结盟。\"而且他们掷得很好，不要只是说：\"是的，这是真的。\" 那是非常不令人满意的，因为玩家已经怀疑了。",
	"Instead, give them something to act on. \"Yes, it seems like they are in league. Your people overheard a conversation that only makes sense if the wizard Luris is selling information to the baron.\"": "相反，给他们一些行动的依据。\"是的，看来他们是一伙的。你的人偷听到一段对话，只有在巫师卢斯向男爵出售信息时才说得通。\"",
	"Hey now, that is actionable. Maybe you just made up that wizard, that's fine! That's your job! But now the player has something to do.": "嘿，现在，那是可操作的。也许你只是编造了那个巫师，这很好! 那是你的工作! 但现在玩家有事情要做了。",
	"Your players will make a Gather Intel check, and you'll give them some juicy bit of knowledge, but of course you're not going to tell them everything. Which means they're going to ask for more. They'll want to drill down on what you said and pursue it. \"Where did I get this info? Who told it to me?\"": "你的玩家会做一个Gather Intel检查，你会给他们一些多汁的知识，但你当然不会告诉他们所有的事情。这意味着他们会要求得到更多。他们会想深入了解你所说的内容，并继续追问。\"我从哪里得到这些信息？谁告诉我的？\"",
	"This just makes your life as GM more complicated because we GMs, of course, have no idea exactly who their spies heard this from, and if we're suddenly faced with the responsibility of not only inventing an NPC who we didn't know about five seconds ago, but also figuring out the entire signal path of how this NPC knows what they know and who they got it from, then we're going to want to ditch this whole system because it just makes more problems than solutions.": "这只是让你作为GM的生活变得更加复杂，因为我们GM当然不知道他们的间谍到底是从谁那里听到的，如果我们突然面临着不仅要发明一个五秒钟前我们还不知道的NPC，还要弄清楚这个NPC如何知道他们所知道的以及他们是从谁那里得到的整个信号路径，那么我们就会想要抛弃这整个系统，因为它只是制造了更多的问题而不是解决方案。",
	"So when your players inevitably ask, \"How exactly do I know this?\" there's one easy answer: \"Someone who works for you, someone you trust, overheard it, but they don't remember who said it.\"": "因此，当你的球员不可避免地问，\"我到底是怎么知道的？\"有一个简单的答案。\"为你工作的人，你信任的人，无意中听到了，但他们不记得是谁说的。\"",
	"You can even play it out. When the player, out of character, asks, \"How do I know this?\" You can respond in character. \"{@i Don't know, ma'am. I was workin' the shop and overheard it. Ooh it musta been a week or more ago?}\"": "你甚至可以把它发挥出来。当玩家脱离角色，问道：\"我怎么知道这个？\" 你可以用角色来回答。\"{@i Don't know, ma'am. I was workin' the shop and overheard it. Ooh it musta been a week or more ago?}\"",
	"The player may not be satisfied by that and may even try to subvert the system by giving orders to their employees to, like, write everything down or keep a journal. At this point, it is perfectly appropriate to tell them, \"This is the limit of what your stronghold can do.\" No point in misleading them—just give it to them straight. They are looking for a degree of specificity this system does not support.": "玩家可能对此不满意，甚至可能试图颠覆这个系统，给他们的雇员下达命令，比如，把所有东西都写下来或者写日记。这时，完全可以告诉他们：\"这是你的据点所能做到的极限。没有必要误导他们--只要直接告诉他们。他们正在寻找这个系统不支持的具体程度。",
	"The best character to deliver the results of the Gather Intel check to the PC is the PC's lieutenant. This is the character who runs the establishment while the PC is out adventuring and who is a trusted NPC. When pressed, \"how did you get this information?\" the lieutenant can shrug and say \"I didn't collect it personally, one of the workers we employ overheard it.\"": "将收集情报检查的结果传递给PC的最佳角色是PC的副手。这是一个在PC外出冒险时管理机构的角色，他是一个值得信赖的NPC。当被问及 \"你是如何得到这些信息的？\"时，中尉可以耸耸肩说：\"我没有亲自收集，是我们雇佣的一个工人无意中听到的。\"",
	"If the player is persistent and really wants to dig down and get more details, that may be reasonable, but it might also require more work on your part to invent an answer. In which case that's a good reason to ask for another Gather Intel check.": "如果玩家很执着，真的想挖掘并获得更多的细节，这可能是合理的，但这也可能需要你做更多的工作来发明一个答案。在这种情况下，这就是要求再进行一次收集情报检查的好理由。",
	"Back at the start of this chapter we said you probably had little use for an army or a modified spell, but if you did, shouldn't you be able to spend a little money, help someone out, and earn a favor from them? According to these rules...yes! You temporarily gain the benefit of another stronghold! Once per season, you may spend 1,000 gp to choose a favor below. To do this, you must know someone with the appropriate stronghold who considers you an ally.": "早在本章开始时我们就说过，你可能对军队或修改后的法术没有什么用处，但如果你有，你难道不应该花点钱，帮助别人，并从他们那里获得好处吗？根据这些规则......是的! 你暂时获得了另一个据点的好处! 每季一次，你可以花1,000金币选择以下一个忙。要做到这一点，你必须认识一个拥有相应据点并将你视为盟友的人。",
	"You gain 500 points per level of your ally's keep to spend on units for one battle. These units cost you no gold pieces, have no upkeep, but disband after the battle is over. The units may only come from ancestries you and your ally with a keep have access to. You'll find more about the point values of units in {@book Appendix: Warfare (page 233)|SaF|10}.": "你的盟友每升一级就会获得500点积分，用于购买一场战斗中的单位。这些单位不需要花费你的金币，没有维护费，但在战斗结束后会被解散。这些单位只能来自于你和你的盟友所拥有的守卫的祖先。你可以在{@book Appendix: Warfare (page 233)|SaF|10}中找到更多关于单位的积分值。",
	"Choose a modified spell researched by an NPC ally or other party member. You can cast that modified spell a number of times equal to your establishment level before you forget it. Once you forget it, you must pay for another favor in order to cast it again.": "选择一个由NPC盟友或其他党员研究的改良法术。在你忘记它之前，你可以施放该改良法术的次数与你的机构等级相等。一旦你忘记了它，你必须支付另一个人情才能再次施放它。",
	"Choose an allied NPC or party member with a temple. You can petition their deity and use their concordance once. If you summon a servitor, it remains for a number of rounds equal to your establishment level.": "选择一个有庙宇的盟友NPC或聚会成员。你可以向他们的神灵请愿，并使用他们的协奏曲一次。如果你召唤一个仆从，它所停留的回合数与你的建立等级相等。",
	"The money for the favor goes to the ally. A PC ally could refuse to grant the favor but they cannot change how much the favor costs. They may want to negotiate better terms, or get something else in return, but the benefits of the favor originate from the establishment and the power of the network of people in your employ to lie, manipulate, and double-deal so that the folks granting the favor think it was their idea. A PC ally therefore might want to name their own terms, (\"I will grant you this favor if...,\") but if they accept the payment, the establishment's owner gets the favor. As a rule, an NPC ally will not try to negotiate. They will accept the money and the PCs gains the favor.": "这个恩惠的钱归盟友所有。一个PC盟友可以拒绝给予恩惠，但他们不能改变恩惠的价格。他们可能想要谈判更好的条件，或者得到其他的回报，但是这个恩惠的好处来自于你所雇佣的人的建立和网络的力量，他们可以撒谎、操纵和进行双重交易，从而使授予恩惠的人认为这是他们的主意。因此，一个PC盟友可能想说出他们自己的条件，（\"如果......，我就给你这个忙\"），但是如果他们接受付款，机构的所有者就会得到这个忙。作为一项规则，NPC盟友不会试图进行谈判。他们会接受钱，而NPC则获得好处。",
	"Regardless of whether you build a keep, a tower, a temple, or an establishment, your stronghold improves your signature class ability, and attracts followers based on your class.": "无论你建造的是堡垒、塔楼、庙宇还是机构，你的据点都会提高你的标志性等级能力，并根据你的等级吸引追随者。",
	"The stronghold for each class has a dramatic name—a \"bard's theater,\" a \"monk's monastery.\" But these names are merely examples chosen for flavor, you are free to imagine and name your stronghold in whatever manner seems best to you. Maybe your bard owns a library! Fantastic excuse to get folks coming in and out each dropping off useful nuggets of information. Maybe your barbarian prefers calling it their Horde rather than a camp! It's entirely up to you.": "每个等级的据点都有一个戏剧性的名字--\"吟游诗人的剧院\"、\"和尚的修道院\"。但这些名字只是为了调味而选择的例子，你可以自由想象并以你认为最好的方式命名你的据点。也许你的吟游诗人拥有一个图书馆！这是个很好的借口。这是一个很好的借口，可以让人们进进出出，把有用的信息扔掉。也许你的野蛮人更喜欢称它为部落，而不是营地。这完全取决于你。",
	"Furthermore, many of the following abilities reference alignment, but that's purely because I'm old-fashioned and prefer the era when paladins fought for good, and I always assume warlocks are sinister. Feel free to reinterpret the abilities so they benefit you and your allies and harm your enemies, however they're defined.": "此外，下面的许多能力都提到了结盟，但这纯粹是因为我是个老古董，喜欢圣骑士为善而战的时代，而且我总是认为术士是邪恶的。你可以自由地重新解释这些能力，使它们对你和你的盟友有利，对你的敌人有害，不管它们被如何定义。",
	"Owning a stronghold, leading people, inspires you and grants you insight. It also allows you to draw power from the land itself. The land you protect serves you just as the workers who built your keep, and you in turn protect the land just as you protect your {@footnote peasants and serfs|Not very egalitarian, but accurate. Besides, the traditional relationship between the lord and the people who worked the land was a lot less exploitative than people think.}.": "拥有一个据点，领导人们，激励你并授予你洞察力。它还能让你从土地本身汲取力量。你保护的土地为你服务，就像建造你的堡垒的工人一样，而你反过来保护土地，就像保护你的（%0%）一样。",
	"This mystical connection manifests in actual power. When your druid takes on the form of a bear and gains fire breath, or your paladin's sword cuts through the enemy defenses, this is the power of the land itself coursing through you. Rewarding you for your protection of it.": "这种神秘的联系表现为实际的力量。当你的德鲁伊变成熊的形态并获得火的气息，或者你的圣骑士的剑穿过敌人的防御，这就是土地本身的力量在你身上流淌。奖励你对它的保护。",
	"The ruler feels this and knows when the land is ill. The connection between the ruler and their land is real and palpable.": "统治者感受到了这一点，并知道土地何时生病。统治者和他们的土地之间的联系是真实的、可感知的。",
	"The area governed by a stronghold is called a demesne (deh-MAYNE) and grows as the stronghold does, expanding the owner's rule in a radius of hexes equal to the stronghold level. Kingdoms & Warfare will have many more rules for this. The system in both books assumes a 24-mile hex, so all powers affect a 12-mile radius per stronghold level.": "一个据点所管辖的区域被称为demesne（deh-MAYNE），并随着据点的增长而增长，在与据点等级相等的六边形半径内扩大所有者的统治。王国与战争》将有许多这方面的规则。这两本书中的系统都假设了24英里的六边形，所以所有的权力都影响到每个据点等级的12英里半径。",
	"The power of a stronghold changes the land around it in dramatic and sometimes mechanically interesting ways. As the regent of the land, you'll gain new abilities that only work within your stronghold, the nexus of your power. These stronghold actions are epic! But don't worry, GMs—stronghold actions only work inside the stronghold (unless otherwise noted), so there's no danger the player will use them to unbalance your game.": "一个据点的力量会以戏剧性的、有时是机械性的有趣方式改变它周围的土地。作为土地的摄政者，你将获得新的能力，这些能力只在你的据点--你的力量的中心点--内发挥作用。这些据点的行动是史诗般的。但是别担心，GM们--据点行动只在据点内起作用（除非另有说明），所以不会有玩家使用它们来破坏游戏平衡的危险。",
	"Building a stronghold makes a statement. You make allies, but also enemies. Having some of those enemies attack the player in their stronghold, perhaps infiltrating it under cover of night, perhaps gaining entrance under guise of some diplomatic or trade mission, gives the player a chance to feel really badass, which is a core element of this fantasy we're all engaging with.": "建立据点是一种声明。你会结交盟友，但也会有敌人。让其中一些敌人攻击玩家的据点，也许是在夜色的掩护下潜入据点，也许是在一些外交或贸易任务的掩护下进入据点，让玩家有机会感受到真正的坏蛋，这也是我们所从事的这个幻想的核心元素。",
	"Players may be tempted to abuse their stronghold actions, using them to show off in inappropriate circumstances. Should they abuse this privilege, they may find the land they serve and which grants them this power has limited resources and even less patience.": "玩家可能会受到诱惑而滥用他们的据点行动，在不适当的情况下利用它们来炫耀。如果他们滥用这种特权，他们可能会发现他们所服务的、授予他们这种权力的土地资源有限，甚至没有耐心。",
	"Founding a stronghold improves your class' signature feature as your new demesne grants you power. Typically this improved class feature has a limited number of uses (based on your stronghold level, usually) after which you must take an {@book extended rest|SaF|2} (page 15) to refresh the ability.": "创立一个据点可以提高你的等级特征，因为你的新领地会赋予你力量。通常情况下，这种改进的等级特征有一定的使用次数（通常基于你的据点等级），之后你必须服用一个（%0%）（第15页）来刷新该能力。",
	"Each class has its own unique follower chart, listed below. These charts make certain assumptions about how the different classes are each perceived by society. Two classes may be equally effective in combat, but that doesn't say anything about how the local artisans or infantry company feel about them.": "每个阶级都有自己独特的追随者图表，列在下面。这些图表对社会如何看待不同阶级做出了一定的假设。两个阶级在战斗中可能同样有效，但这并不能说明当地的工匠或步兵连对他们有什么感觉。",
	"Some classes have a wider range of results. Paladins can gain more different followers than Sorcerers. This reflects how normal people view the different classes. Paladins and fighters and clerics tend to be respected, trusted. If they have spells, they often use them to help and heal. But peasants don't react well to sorcery, to arcane knowledge Man Was Not Meant to Know!": "有些类别的结果范围更广。圣骑士可以比巫师获得更多不同的追随者。这反映了正常人如何看待不同的阶级。圣骑士和战士以及牧师往往被尊重，被信任。如果他们有法术，他们经常用它们来帮助和治疗。但农民对巫术、对人类本不应该知道的神秘知识反应不大。",
	"The follower options for each class reflect this. Martial classes are more likely to get military units, while classes that use sorcery and delve into hidden places or research forgotten lore are more likely to get {@table special allies|SaF} (page 67).": "每个等级的随从选项都反映了这一点。武术类更有可能得到军事单位，而使用巫术和深入隐秘场所或研究被遗忘的传说的类更有可能得到（%0%）（第67页）。",

But I don't know your campaign or your characters! By all means, if you think your player's ranger would attract a paladin follower, feel free to change their follower chart. Or just award them a paladin follower. No need to roll!": "{@b The follower charts in this chapter are meant to inspire you, not limit you.}它们是基于假设的，其中有些假设你可能不同意！我倾向于认为游侠和流氓是偷偷摸摸的、游击式的角色。例如，我倾向于认为游侠和流氓是阴险的、游击式的角色，所以在这个系统中他们不能吸引像圣骑士那样的法律代理人。但我并不了解你的活动和你的角色！如果你认为你的活动和你的角色有问题，你可以提出来。如果你认为你的玩家的游侠会吸引一个圣骑士的追随者，请随意改变他们的追随者列表。或者直接授予他们一个圣骑士随从。不需要滚。",

	"Like all such choices, including the choice of what adventure to run, or which monsters to use, or how a given NPC will react, this option gives you the power to curate the experience and pick something you know both the player will like and won't unbalance your game or make your life hard.

	"Running a PC is actually quite a lot of work compared to almost any other kind of game we play.

	"Then on top of this, the cleric inevitably asks, \"Well, okay, but what is that compared to your total?\" Because obviously \"30 damage\" can mean very different things to different characters and at different levels. So the cleric wants to know what {@i percentage} of your health you have left. But no one ever asks that—that would mean even more math.": "然后在此基础上，教士不可避免地会问：\"好吧，好吧，但与你的总数相比，这算什么？\" 因为很明显，\"30次伤害 \"对不同的角色和不同的等级意味着非常不同的东西。所以教士想知道你的健康状况还剩多少（%0%）。但是从来没有人问过这个问题--那意味着更多的数学问题。",

You're to be forgiven for not knowing the difference.\" It glanced at them again briefly. \"Do you know where I put the Treatise on Manifold Planes? I was certain I filed it away with the rest of the geometries. Will take me forever to organize this place. And I don't have forever.\" This last was muttered under its...": "\"啊，浮空，我想你会发现，\"那个生物说，没有看他们。\"尽管可以肯定的是，精神动力学更类似于你的飞行法术。你们不知道其中的区别，应该得到原谅。\" 它又简短地瞥了他们一眼。\"你知道我把《多元平面论》放在哪里了吗？我确信我把它和其他的几何图形一起归档了。我得花一辈子时间来整理这个地方。而我没有永远。\" 最后这句话是在它的下面嘀咕的。",
	"\"I...can you all hear that?\" Jeremy asked, pressing his hands to his head.": "\"我......你们都能听到吗？\" 杰里米问道，用手按住自己的头。",
	"\"It's in my mind,\" Credan said. \"I can hear it between my ears.\" It wasn't an unpleasant sensation. There was a bit of an echo. The voice seemed to be coming from a cave. Were it not for the incredibly expressive face of the creature, eyebrows raising, eyes darting around, lips frowning or sneering, they wouldn't have connected the voice to the creature.": "\"它在我的脑海里，\"克里坦说。\"我可以听到它在我的两耳之间。\" 这并不是一种不愉快的感觉。有一点回声。那声音似乎来自一个山洞。如果不是那张令人难以置信的表情丰富的脸，眉毛上扬，眼睛四处乱瞟，嘴唇皱着或冷笑，他们不会把这个声音与这个生物联系起来。",
	"The creature floated around. \"What?\" it asked. \"Oh. Well, we topaz develop mindspeech early. It shouldn't cause you any...discomfort.\" It spoke absentmindedly, tiny hand-like paws fingering the spines of books. A fin atop its head waved slowly in time with tendrils growing from its jaw, as though moved by underwater currents.": "该生物漂浮在周围。\"什么？\"它问。\"哦，好吧，我们托帕斯人很早就发展出了心语。它不应该给你带来任何......不舒服。\" 它心不在焉地说话，小手一样的爪子指着书的书脊。它头顶上的鳍随着下巴上长出的卷须缓缓挥动，就像被水下的水流冲动一样。",
	"\"It's a...I think it's a dragon,\" Meliora said.": "\"这是一条......我想这是一条龙，\"梅利奥拉说。",
	"The creature turned and gave them a knowing look. If it had possessed spectacles, it would have peered over them. \"Yes, well done. And you are terrans. Oh that's rude, isn't it? Forgive me. Men.\"": "这个生物转过身来，给了他们一个明白的眼神。如果它拥有眼镜，它就会从眼镜上看过去。\"是的，做得好。而你们是地球人。哦，这很无礼，不是吗？请原谅我。男人。\"",
	"\"And women!\" Wenna exclaimed.": "\"还有女人！\" 温娜感叹道。",
	"\"Truly?\" The dragon turned back to the books. \"Well. I cherish my ignorance on the subject.\"": "\"真的吗？\" 龙回过头来看书。\"嗯。我很珍惜我对这个问题的无知。\"",
	"\"If you're a dragon...\" Wenna said, suspiciously, \"where are your wings?!\" Credan tugged on her linen shirt in a vain attempt to hush her.": "\"如果你是一条龙......\" 温娜怀疑地说道，\"你的翅膀在哪里？\" 克里丹扯了扯她的亚麻布衬衫，妄图让她安静下来。",
	"\"Hands are better, don't you think?\"": "\"手是更好的，你不觉得吗？\"",
	"\"But how do you fly?\" Meliora demanded.": "\"但你怎么飞？\" 梅利奥拉要求道。",
	"The dragon turned again to them. It tapped its head with a single finger from its tiny forepaws, then returned to its work.": "这条龙再次转向他们。它用细小的前爪的一根手指敲打着自己的头，然后回到了自己的工作岗位上。",
	"\"We have to go back,\" Credan said, now tugging on Dade and Jeremy's makeshift armor.": "\"我们必须回去，\"克里坦说，现在拽着戴德和杰里米的临时盔甲。",
	"\"Da needs to know about this.\"": "\"达需要知道这件事。\"",
	"The topaz wyrmling turned at this, and stared at them, blinking. Then it made the connection. \"You're children!\"": "黄玉色的巫师听到这话转过身来，盯着他们，眨了眨眼睛。然后，它建立了联系。\"你们是孩子！\"",
	"\"I'll have eighteen summers this Lyleth,\" Dade said, standing up straight.": "\"我将有十八个夏天这个Lyleth，\"Dade说，站直了。",
	"\"Indeed? Fascinating, fascinating. Older than me, when taken in percentages.\"": "\"确实如此？迷人的，迷人的。比我还老，如果按百分比计算的话。\"",
	"\"Older than you?\" Meliora stepped forward. She couldn't control her curiosity. Her hands twitched with desire to touch the thing.": "\"比你大？\" 梅利奥拉向前走了一步。她无法控制自己的好奇心。她的手因渴望触摸那东西而抽搐。",
	"\"Yes, well. What is time? I've spent most of the last several thousand years asleep. Lot of that going around, I'm told. Though, of course, not anymore.\"": "\"是的，好。时间是什么？在过去的几千年里，我大部分时间都在睡觉。我听说有很多这样的事情在发生。虽然，当然，现在不是了。\"",
	"Very little of the conversation made sense to the children. Jeremy looked at Dade. Decided to assert himself.": "谈话内容对孩子们来说几乎没有意义。杰里米看了看戴德。决定坚持自己的立场。",
	"\"We killed the goblins,\" he said. \"Who infested the tower.\"": "\"我们杀了地精，\"他说。\"谁在塔里出没。\"",
	"\"Did you!? Well done, well done. Filthy little things, probably a mistake in retrospect. Ah, well that deserves an introduction, I dare say.\" The creature floated around, following the curve of the round room, lowering itself until its legs, in the daintiest way possible, reached out and touched the ground, supported its weight. Then it fluidly walked toward them, each of its six legs moving like on a well-coordinated marionette.": "\"你有吗！？做得好，做得好。肮脏的小东西，现在回想起来可能是个错误。啊，好吧，这值得介绍一下，我敢说。\" 这个生物漂浮着，沿着圆形房间的曲线，降低自己，直到它的腿，以最娇小的方式，伸出来接触地面，支撑着它的重量。然后，它流畅地走向他们，它的六条腿都像在一个协调良好的木偶上移动。",
	"\"My name is Irdizavonax.\" The little dragon bowed. When it straightened, it was only a little shorter than Dade. As tall as Jeremy. Taller than the others. \"I am the keeper of this tower. Currently. I believe the tradition established by the human wizards who build these things is that, having gained the inner sanctum, you may ask a question.\"": "\"我的名字是伊迪萨沃纳克斯。\" 小龙鞠了一躬。当它伸直身体时，它只比戴德矮一点。和杰里米一样高。比其他的人更高。\"我是这座塔的守护者。目前。我相信由建造这些东西的人类巫师建立的传统是，在获得内部圣殿后，你可以问一个问题。\"",
	"They looked at each other. Meliora, as was typical, ventured a response.": "他们互相看了看。梅利奥拉，作为典型的例子，大胆地做出了回应。",
	"\"Well...w-what should we ask?\"": "\"嗯......我们应该问什么？\"",
	"The topaz wyrmling looked around the abandoned wizard's tower, its original owner long dead, then looked back at the children. \"No idea!\" it exclaimed. \"Not my tradition. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you answers first.\"": "黄玉狼王环顾了一下被遗弃的巫师塔，它的原主人早就死了，然后回头看了看孩子们。\"不知道！\"它叹道。\"不是我的传统。也许我先给你们答案会更好。\"",
	"The creature looked at the ground, suddenly somber. Seemed to gather its thoughts. Then it regarded them again with its alien eyes.": "这只生物看着地面，突然阴沉下来。似乎在收集它的想法。然后它又用它那双异样的眼睛看着他们。",
	"\"Your world is in danger,\" the creature thought at them. \"Corovaxinar stirs, and many of my kith and kin awake. I don't need to tell you, this bodes ill.\"": "\"你们的世界处于危险之中，\"那个生物冲着他们想。\"Corovaxinar在骚动，我的许多亲属都醒来了。我不需要告诉你们，这预示着不好。\"",
	"\"It does?\" Jeremy asked, astonished.": "\"它是这样的？\" 杰里米惊奇地问。",
	"\"Alright, I do need to tell you. Someone from another world, perhaps the World Below? Primordius? I can't be certain, I'm new at this. Someone is trying to merge their world with yours. With ours. It's an invasion, you might say. One reality attacking another. If successful, it would mean most of our world would be...rewritten. Replaced. This would be a catastrophe, you understand.\" It drew itself up proudly.": "\"好吧，我确实需要告诉你。来自另一个世界的人，也许是下面的世界？Primordius？我不能确定，我是新手。有人试图将他们的世界与你的世界合并。和我们的。这是一种入侵，你可以说。一个世界攻击另一个世界。如果成功，这将意味着我们的世界大部分将被......改写。被取代。这将是一场大灾难，你明白吗？\" 它骄傲地站了起来。",
	"\"The gemstone dragons intend to stop them. I think...I think it's why we were created, if you would allow me to wax philosophical for a moment.\"": "\"宝石龙们打算阻止他们。我想......我想这就是我们被创造出来的原因，如果你允许我讲点哲学的话。\"",
	"Jeremy looked from Wenna to Credan to Dade. Meliora was lost in admiration. He looked back at the dragon. \"We don't understand.\"": "杰里米从文娜到克里坦再到戴德。梅利奥拉迷失在敬佩之中。他回头看了看那条龙。\"我们不明白。\"",
	"\"I'm not surprised. Well, this place is yours now, if it's anyone's. I can teach you what you want to know. Or at least, what you need to know, which is more important. I thought some great human wizard would be here but...perhaps...children are better. Much to learn here and all of it written by your ancestors, not mine. Your Shauraseni Empire rivaled any loremasters of the celestials. Ah, elves, I think you call them.": "\"我并不感到惊讶。好吧，这个地方现在是你的了，如果它是任何人的。我可以教你你想知道的东西。或者至少，你需要知道的东西，这更重要。我以为一些伟大的人类巫师会在这里，但是......也许......孩子们会更好。在这里可以学到很多东西，而且都是你们的祖先写的，不是我的。你们Shauraseni帝国可以与天人的任何一个洛雷姆相媲美。啊，精灵，我想你叫他们。",
	"\"In any event, by right this tower is now yours, and I,\" it said, bowing again, \"am your servant. For the time being at least.\"": "\"无论如何，根据权利，这座塔现在是你的，而我，\"它说，再次鞠躬，\"是你的仆人。至少暂时是这样。\"",
	"\"Oh my,\" Wenna said, and the others looked from the dragon to her. She turned to them and beamed.": "\"哦，天哪，\"温娜说，其他人从龙身上看向她。她转过身来，向他们微笑。",
	"\"We've been on a quest!\"": "\"我们一直在追求！\"",
	"A long-forgotten branch of the draco genus, draco crystallus are primarily hexapods like their more common cousins draco metallus and draco chromaticus. They are older than the other draconic genii, which accounts for their wider diversity in body type.": "作为龙王属的一个被遗忘已久的分支，水晶龙主要是六足动物，就像它们更常见的表亲金属龙和铬龙一样。它们比其他龙晶属更古老，这也是它们在身体类型上更广泛的多样性的原因。",
	"Many long ago abandoned their wings or let them atrophy, relying instead on their innate mental powers to lift and propel them telekinetically. They are now rare, hunted for the gemstones that grant them—and, for a brief time, anyone who holds one—their psionic powers. Many have slumbered or hidden from civilization for many thousands of years, only awakening during times of catastrophic need.": "许多人很久以前就放弃了他们的翅膀，或者让它们萎缩，而是依靠他们天生的精神力量来提升和推动他们的心灵感应。他们现在很罕见，被猎杀的原因是宝石赋予了他们--以及在短暂的时间内，任何持有宝石的人都能获得他们的幻觉能力。许多人已经沉睡或隐藏在文明之外数千年，只有在灾难性的需要时才会苏醒。",
	"They are sages and hoard knowledge rather than treasure and so are often found in or near ancient libraries. Their crystalline structure grants them enhanced speed and agility, their nerve impulses being conducted by the piezoelectric effect rather than mere chemical signals.": "他们是圣人，囤积知识而非财宝，因此经常在古代图书馆或附近被发现。他们的晶体结构赋予他们更强的速度和敏捷性，他们的神经冲动是通过压电效应而不是单纯的化学信号传导的。",
	"As a result they are more agile, and their quasicrystalline skin grants them natural armor. Weapons spark and chip jeweled fragments off their hides but find little purchase there. They are harder to hit and damage but have less raw health than their metallic and chromatic cousins.": "因此，他们更加灵活，他们的类晶体皮肤赋予他们天然的盔甲。武器会在他们的皮毛上产生火花和碎片，但在那里几乎找不到什么东西。他们更难被击中并受到伤害，但他们的原始健康状况却比他们的金属和有色表亲要差。",
	"They are the keepers of forgotten lore and rarely take sides in the battles between good, evil, law, and chaos. Rather, they act to preserve the world, or knowledge, or to prevent dangerous knowledge from falling into any hands. They come in every flavor of neutral alignment, but if one is neutral good, they're more neutral good than neutral good, if you take my meaning.": "他们是被遗忘的传说的守护者，很少在善、恶、法律和混乱的争斗中站队。相反，他们的行为是为了保护世界或知识，或防止危险的知识落入任何一方手中。他们有各种类型的中立立场，但如果一个人是中立善，他们就比中立善更中立，如果你明白我的意思。",
	"Unlike their more barbaric cousins, they rarely have an affinity for one type of terrain over other (the emeralds being an exception) and so their lairs can be found anywhere, caves, dungeons, libraries, cities, clouds, pocket dimensions. There is no such thing as a 'typical,' gemstone dragon lair.": "与它们更野蛮的表亲不同，它们很少对一种类型的地形情有独钟（绿宝石是个例外），因此它们的巢穴可以在任何地方找到，山洞、地牢、图书馆、城市、云层、袖珍空间。没有所谓的 \"典型 \"的宝石龙巢穴。",
	"Much rarer than their metallic or chromatic cousins, the gemstone dragonborn are the result of powerful rituals. They are proud of their heritage. Because the gemstone dragons are rare, so rare as to be considered mythical, it's not unusual for their humanoid descendants to pursue a great quest to find their ultimate progenitor...or just any gemstone dragon, to get a sense of where they came from and prove the jeweled dragons are real.": "比起他们的金属或彩色表亲，宝石龙裔要稀少得多，他们是强大仪式的结果。他们对自己的遗产感到自豪。因为宝石龙很稀少，稀少到被认为是神话，所以他们的人形后裔为了寻找他们的最终祖先......或任何宝石龙，以了解他们的来源并证明宝石龙的真实性，而进行伟大的探索是很常见的。",
	"A sound roared and thrummed in their minds. But the creature in front of them was recumbent, sleeping. Still. It looked like a great beast of the plains, satiated after a long hunt.": "一种声音在他们的脑海中咆哮着、激荡着。但他们面前的生物是躺着的，在睡觉。仍然如此。它看起来就像平原上的巨兽，在长时间的狩猎之后饱餐一顿。",
	"The massive sapphire gemstones embedded in and extruding from its skin flashed and coruscated like a lightning storm, arcing along its whole body. And as the young adventurers looked around the cave, with sapphires as big as houses jutting out from all angles, some growing through each other, the jewels of the cave flashed and hummed in response. Sympathetic energies echoed from dragon to cave and back.": "巨大的蓝宝石镶嵌在它的皮肤上，并从它的皮肤中挤出，像闪电风暴一样闪烁和晕眩，沿着它的整个身体划出弧线。当年轻的冒险家们环顾山洞，像房子一样大的蓝宝石从各个角度伸出来，有些还互相穿插生长，山洞里的宝石闪烁着，嗡嗡作响。共鸣的能量从龙到山洞再到龙的回声。",
	"\"Behold!\" Irdizavonax said, \"Corovaxinar!\"": "\"请看！\" Irdizavonax说，\"Corovaxinar！\"",
	"\"It's huge,\" Credan whispered. He and his friends were bathed in deep blue light.": "\"它是巨大的，\"克里坦低声说。他和他的朋友们都沐浴在深蓝色的光芒中。",
	"\"It's asleep!\" Wenna said.": "\"它在睡觉！\" 温娜说。",
	"\"It is in battle,\" Irdizavonax said.": "\"这是在战斗中，\"伊迪萨沃纳克斯说。",
	"\"Battle?!\" Jeremy asked. \"What...it's just lying there.\"": "\"战斗？\"。杰里米问道。\"什么......它只是躺在那里。\"",
	"\"In this realm, yes. But the Eldest are...what did Orvosortiax call it? Realitas? They are too real for one world alone. Corovaxinar exists simultaneously in many worlds. There's a term for the bending of the timescape back upon itself, but I won't bore you with it.\"": "\"在这个领域，是的。但长老们是......Orvosortiax怎么说的来着？真实性？他们对一个世界来说太真实了。科罗瓦克斯纳同时存在于许多世界。有一个术语是关于时空回溯的弯曲，但我不会用它来烦你。\"",
	"\"Thank you,\" Meliora said darkly.": "\"谢谢你，\"梅利奥拉暗暗地说。",
	"\"This is an ancient dragon?\" Wenna asked.": "\"这是一条古龙？\" 温娜问道。",
	"\"Any category would shame it. No, I met an ancient emerald once—it wasn't like this. It could still talk and move without...endangering anyone. This is more. This is the Eldest.\"": "\"任何类别都会让它感到羞耻。不，我曾经见过一块古老的绿宝石--它不像这样。它仍然可以说话和移动而不......危及任何人。这是更多。这是最古老的。\"",
	"\"Battle.\" Dade watched the creature's internal lightning strikes illuminate them and the cave. \"It's fighting something on some other plane.\"": "\"战斗。\" 戴德看着这个生物的内部雷击照亮了他们和洞穴。\"它正在与其他星球上的东西战斗。\"",
	"\"Better there than here!\" Credan said.": "\"在那里比在这里好！\" 克里坦说。",
	"\"We thought we came here for answers,\" Jeremy said, looking at Dade.": "\"我们以为我们是来这里寻找答案的，\"杰里米说，看着戴德。",
	"Dade looked to the topaz dragon who'd befriended them. \"But all we find is violence.\"": "戴德看向与他们结为朋友的黄玉龙。\"但我们找到的都是暴力。\"",
	"\"Oh, answers often lead to violence,\" the topaz wyrmling sighed. \"It is the way of things.\"": "\"哦，答案往往导致暴力，\"黄玉色的巫师叹了口气。\"这就是事情的方式。\"",
	"They noticed, every time the eldest sapphire dragon's gemstones flashed with deep blue energy, Irdizavonax's fins and tentacles blew in an invisible wind. The light from the eldest sapphire wasn't blinding, but Irdizavonax had to squint to see through whatever powers were bleeding out of the sleeping, embattled dragon.": "他们注意到，每当最年长的蓝宝石龙的宝石闪烁着深蓝色的能量时，Irdizavonax的鳍和触手就会被一股无形的风吹动。来自长生蓝宝石的光芒并不刺眼，但伊迪萨沃纳斯不得不眯起眼睛，以看清从这只沉睡的、受困的龙身上流出来的任何力量。",
	"\"I think...the same things we fought in Blackbottom...wherever they're from...that's where it,\" Jeremy nodded at the sleeping dragon, \"is fighting.\"": "\"我认为......我们在布莱克波特姆战斗的那些东西......无论他们来自哪里......那就是它，\"杰里米对着沉睡的龙点点头，\"正在战斗。\"",
	"\"How did you figure that out?\" Dade asked.": "\"你是怎么算出来的？\" 达德问。",
	"Jeremy shrugged. \"Just seemed obvious.\"": "杰里米耸了耸肩。\"只是看起来很明显。\"",
	"\"Hmhp,\" Irdizavonax sniffed.": "\"嗯哼，\"伊迪萨沃纳克斯闻言说道。",
	"\"Irdy,\" Meliora said. The little dragon appeared to ignore her. \"This is because of you, isn't it?\"": "\"Irdy，\"梅丽奥拉说。小龙似乎没有理会她。\"这都是因为你，不是吗？\"",
	"\"Ah, probably,\" the topaz wyrmling said. \"I'm not a theologist, but others have suggested that we topaz were made by Ket to ah...accelerate any potential victory.\" The little dragon turned to Meliora and smiled. \"Accelerate you, you might say. Dumb humans aren't much use to us.\"": "\"啊，可能吧，\"黄宝石巫师说。\"我不是神学家，但其他人认为，我们黄玉是由凯特制造的，以啊......加速任何潜在的胜利。\" 小龙转向梅丽奥拉，微笑着说。\"加速你，你可以说。愚蠢的人类对我们没有什么用处。\"",
	"\"What...what happens when we're not around you anymore?\" Wenna asked, gripping the handle of her lute tightly.": "\"什么......当我们不在你身边时会发生什么？\" 温娜问道，紧紧握住她的琵琶把手。",
	"\"You know the answer. Our name for ourselves is the Carisovantinaar. It means the Quickening of the Way. The sapphire dragons,\" he said, nodding to Corovaxinar, \"project Awe, as is their right as the First Born. The rubies enhance arcanism, as you yourself saw, Meliora, when we fought alongside Orvosortiax.": "\"你知道答案的。我们自己的名字是Carisovantinaar。它的意思是 \"道路的加速\"。蓝宝石龙，\"他说，向Corovaxinar点了点头，\"投射敬畏，这是它们作为长生者的权利。红宝石增强了奥术，正如你自己所看到的，梅丽奥拉，当我们与Orvosortiax并肩作战的时候。",
	"\"We topaz project...cleverness.\" It seemed the little dragon was amused.": "\"我们黄玉项目......很聪明。\" 看来小龙被逗乐了。",
	"\"Intelligence,\" Dade said.": "\"情报，\"达德说。",
	"The topaz dragon looked the eldest boy—certainly a man now, after everything they'd been through—up and down. \"Well that remains to be seen,\" he said. And Dade smiled, recognizing the joke. They'd all gotten used to the little dragon's mode of speech in the last few months.": "黄玉龙看着最年长的男孩--在他们所经历的一切之后，现在肯定是个男人。\"那还有待观察，\"他说。戴德笑了笑，认出了这个笑话。在过去的几个月里，他们都已经习惯了这只小龙的说话方式。",
	"\"I don't think I like it,\" Meliora said.": "\"我不认为我喜欢它，\"梅利奥拉说。",
	"\"Now you know how I feel,\" Irdy said, smiling.": "\"现在你知道我的感受了，\"伊迪说，微笑着。",
	"\"What happens if we wake him up?\" Wenna asked.": "\"如果我们把他吵醒会怎么样？\" 温娜问。",
	"\"Her, I think you'll find. Oh, I should think it would be the end of this reality,\" Irdizavonax said casually. \"Or at least this version of it. Perhaps something more interesting will come along, that would be nice.\"": "\"她，我想你会发现。哦，我应该认为这将是这个现实的结束，\"伊迪萨沃纳克斯随口说道。\"或者至少是它的这个版本。也许会有更有趣的东西出现，那就好了。\"",
	"\"The end...\" Dade said.": "\"结束了......\" 达德说。",
	"\"Well it's true of all the eldest. I don't mean the creatures of meat and bone you call dragons. Echoes. I mean the real thing. The chromatics, the metallics. The eldest of them sleep to protect the world—the ones remaining do, at any rate. Mostly I think the chromatics sleep because they know how angry their god would be if they dared to wake.\"": "\"嗯，所有最年长的人都是如此。我指的不是你们称之为龙的那些肉和骨头的生物。回声。我指的是真正的东西。有色人种，金属人种。他们中最年长的人睡觉是为了保护这个世界--不管怎么说，剩下的那些人都是如此。我想大多数情况下，铬族人睡觉是因为他们知道如果他们敢于醒来，他们的神会有多生气。\"",
	"\"But we have to talk to it!\" Wenna said. \"You saw what happened in Blackbottom! Our town may already be...be erased.\"": "\"但我们必须和它谈谈！\" 温娜说。\"你看到了在布莱克博特姆发生的事情！我们的小镇可能已经......被抹去了。我们的小镇可能已经......被抹去了。\"",
	"\"There may be other ways.\" Irdizavonax's tendrils stroked his own chin in thought.": "\"可能还有其他方法。\" 伊迪萨沃纳克斯的卷须抚摸着自己的下巴思考着。",
	"\"Can't you...talk into her head?\" Credan asked.": "\"你不能......对着她的脑袋说话吗？\" 克里坦问道。",
	"\"Oh of a surety,\" Irdizavonax said. \"But you see we jeweled dragons operate on similar wavelengths. And I am but a lowly wyrmling. Were I to attempt it...attempt it and succeed, she would almost certainly shatter my mind. Nothing personal, you understand.\" Irdy looked with some awe at the eldest sapphire. \"It's just the power of it.\"": "\"哦，肯定的，\"伊迪萨沃纳克斯说。\"但你看，我们珠宝龙在类似的波长上运作。而我只是一个卑微的巫妖。如果我尝试......尝试并成功，她几乎肯定会粉碎我的思想。这不是针对你的，你要明白。\" 伊尔迪有些敬畏地看着最年长的蓝宝石。\"这只是它的力量。\"",
	"After a moment lost in overwhelming fascination, Irdy turned to Meliora. \"I believe this is your puzzle to solve, young wizard.\"": "在迷恋了一会儿后，伊迪转向梅丽奥拉。\"我相信这是你要解决的难题，年轻的巫师。\"",
	"Meliora shook her head. \"No,\" she said, backing away. \"Not after the Fane. Not after what that ruby dragon did to me.\"": "梅丽奥拉摇了摇头。\"不，\"她说，向后退去。\"在法恩之后就不是了。在那条红宝石龙对我所做的一切之后。\"",
	"Irdy's tendrils drooped. \"I understand,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\"": "伊迪的卷须垂下。\"我明白，\"他说。\"我很抱歉。\"",
	"\"Wenna,\" Jeremy said. \"Wenna, what about you?\"": "\"温娜，\"杰里米说。\"温娜，你呢？\"",
	"The young girl gripped her lute in a brief panic.": "年轻的女孩在短暂的恐慌中抓紧了她的琵琶。",
	"\"Capital! Yes, tiny minstrel, sing us a song!\" Irdy said. Wenna cast him a dark look, but without much malice. She knew the dragon liked teasing her.": "\"首都！是的，小小的吟游诗人，为我们唱首歌吧！\" 伊迪说。温娜向他投去一个阴暗的眼神，但没有多少恶意。她知道这条龙喜欢戏弄她。",
	"Dade smiled and put a hand on her shoulder. \"You don't have to, if you don't want to.\" Had he not, she might have balked. But being condescended to pushed her over the edge. She jerked her shoulder away. \"I want to,\" she said defiantly.": "达德微笑着把一只手放在她的肩膀上。\"如果你不愿意，你不必这样做。\" 如果他不这样做，她可能会退缩。但被屈尊俯就把她推到了边缘。她把肩膀扭开。\"我想，\"她挑衅地说道。",
	"She tuned her lute and stepped forward. She always seemed frightened, frightened by everything, but music made her bold. Given the nature of her weapons, perhaps the boldest of them all. To face the ancient sapphire demigod, armed only with strings and a song.": "她调好了她的琵琶，走到了前面。她似乎总是很害怕，对一切都感到害怕，但音乐使她变得大胆。鉴于她的武器的性质，也许是所有武器中最大胆的。面对古老的蓝宝石半神，只用琴弦和歌声来武装自己。",
	"The song was a trifle. Nothing like the tunes the Riojan in Blackbottom taught her. It was a folk song from home, and it made the children glad and homesick.": "这首歌是个小东西。与布莱克博特姆的里约人教她的曲子完全不同。这是一首来自家乡的民歌，它让孩子们感到高兴和思乡。",
	"Before she could finish the song, a flash of sapphire energy—and a being materialized in mid-stride, walking toward them.": "在她唱完这首歌之前，蓝宝石般的能量一闪而过--一个生命在半路上实现了，向他们走来。",
	"It was short, at least, shorter than Dade. Lithe. Humanoid in form, but otherwise an insect with brilliant, multifaceted eyes. It bore twin rapiers at its hips and wore emerald green armor that reflected light with a liquid sheen, unlike any substance they'd seen before. It reminded them of a beetle's carapace.": "它很矮，至少，比戴德矮。身材轻巧。外形像人，但除此之外就是一只昆虫，有一双明亮、多面的眼睛。它的臀部有两把剑，穿着翠绿色的盔甲，反射着液体光泽的光线，与他们以前见过的任何物质都不同。这让他们想起了甲虫的甲壳。",
	"Its antennae curled and twitched, sensing arcane forces in the air. It seemed full of cocky confidence and daring.": "它的触角卷曲和抽动，感觉到空气中的奥秘力量。它似乎充满了狂妄的自信和胆量。",
	"\"A mantis knight!\" Irdy exclaimed in delight. \"Oh I'd forgotten about them. Well done, old lady.\"": "\"一个螳螂骑士！\" 伊迪高兴地喊道。\"哦，我已经忘记了他们。干得好，老太太。\"",
	"Wenna, Dade, and Jeremy had drawn their weapons. Credan started saying a prayer under his breath. Only Meliora did nothing, except wonder. She was already way ahead of them.": "温娜、戴德和杰里米已经拔出了他们的武器。克里丹开始在口中念念有词地祈祷。只有梅丽奥拉什么也没做，只是好奇。她已经远远超过了他们。",
	"\"This isn't real, is it?\" She could tell by the way it manifested.": "\"这不是真的，是吗？\" 她可以从它的表现方式上看出来。",
	"\"Very good,\" Irdizavonax said with a slight bow. \"Well, real is, as Orvosortiax taught you, mostly a collection of habits, and by that standard...this creature is very real.\"": "\"很好，\"伊迪萨沃纳克斯微微鞠躬说。\"嗯，真实是，正如Orvosortiax教给你的，主要是习惯的集合，按照这个标准......这个生物非常真实。\"",
	"The creature stopped before them and bowed, one hand flourishing before it, the opposite leg extended slightly out.": "这个生物在他们面前停了下来，鞠了一躬，一只手在它面前发扬光大，另一条腿稍微伸出来。",
	"It spoke. Its voice was gay, like birdsong on a spring morning. \"Corovaxinar remembers things that were, things that should have been, and things that might yet be. I am Lady Eweshtleth. I hold the honor of the Gate and the Door.\"": "它说话了。它的声音很欢快，像春天早晨的鸟鸣。\"Corovaxinar记得过去的事情，应该是过去的事情，还有可能是现在的事情。我是Eweshtleth女士。我拥有门和门的荣誉。\"",
	"The children stared in rapt attention. Only Irdizavonax was not in awe. \"They're from the Court of...well, now the Court of Arcadia, I suppose,\" he said. \"But once the Mantis Knights were the chief lieutenants of the elves. Still are, I imagine. Somewhere.\"": "孩子们全神贯注地盯着。只有伊迪萨沃纳克斯没有感到敬畏。\"他们来自......嗯，现在是阿卡迪亚法院，我想，\"他说。\"但曾经，螳螂骑士是精灵的首席副官。现在仍然是，我想。在某个地方。\"",
	"\"So this a...a memory?\" Meliora asked.": "\"那么这是......一段记忆？\" 梅利奥拉问道。",
	"\"Good guess, but I don't think so. Well, maybe. Rather I suspect this is a real person who lived...or will live, displaced chronographically.\"": "\"猜得好，但我不认为如此。嗯，也许吧。相反，我怀疑这是一个真实的人，他活着......或将活着，在时间上被取代。\"",
	"\"What?\" Several of the children asked.": "\"什么？\" 几个孩子问道。",
	"\"Oh she's from the past, probably. Or the future.\" When none of them spoke, Irdy took it upon himself to impress them with the gravity of the situation. \"This is the power of the Eldest.\"": "\"哦，她是来自过去，可能。或者是未来。\" 当他们都不说话时，伊尔迪主动向他们强调了情况的严重性。\"这就是长老会的力量。\"",
	"Meliora looked at the little dragon. Someday...if they succeeded, a million million years from now, Irdy would be like that massive creature slumbering before them. She wondered, privately, if the little dragon would remember them then.": "梅利奥拉看着小龙。有一天......如果他们成功了，从现在起一百万年后，伊迪也会像那个沉睡在他们面前的巨大生物一样。她私下里想，小龙到时是否会记得他们。",
	"\"Corovaxinar welcomes you,\" the alien insect-woman spoke in a smooth, assured voice. Quite unlike the absentminded old professor they'd gotten used to in Irdy.": "\"科罗瓦西纳欢迎你，\"这个外星昆虫女人用平稳、肯定的声音说话。与他们在伊迪习惯的那个心不在焉的老教授截然不同。",
	"Everyone looked to Irdy, but Irdy nodded to Meliora.": "大家都看向伊迪，但伊迪向梅丽奥拉点了点头。",
	"\"Oh. Ah. Okay, um...hello. Ah, welcome to...our world.\"": "\"哦，啊。好的，嗯......你好。啊，欢迎来到......我们的世界。\"",
	"\"A world under siege,\" the Mantis Knight said to Meliora. \"Corovaxinar needs your help.\"": "\"一个被围困的世界，\"螳螂骑士对梅丽奥拉说。\"科罗瓦克纳需要你的帮助。\"",

	"\"The Soul Carver!\" Irdizavonax exclaimed, taking a step back from Dade. \"Ah yes! Many threads converge. Much that was hidden is now revealed. Hah! And to think I stood with you when you found it. Ahh, to be alive and young in such a time.\"": "\"灵魂雕刻者！\" 伊迪萨沃纳克斯惊呼，从戴德身边退了一步。\"啊，是的! 许多线索汇聚在一起。许多被隐藏的东西现在被揭示出来。哈! 想想看，当你发现它时，我和你站在一起。啊，在这样一个时代活着，而且很年轻。\"",

	"The knight cleared her throat, and a portal opened behind her. A swirling, cloudy thing. \"I am the Gate and the Door,\" she said.": "骑士清了清嗓子，一个门户在她身后打开。一个漩涡状的、浑浊的东西。\"我是门和门，\"她说。",
	"\"The door to where?\" Meliora challenged.": "\"通往哪里的门？\" 梅利奥拉质疑道。",

	"At the edge of the portal, they stopped and looked behind them. Irdizavonax hadn't moved. Looking very small now, he stood alone.": "在传送门的边缘，他们停下脚步，看着身后。伊尔迪萨沃纳克斯没有动。现在看起来非常小，他独自站着。",
	"\"Aren't you coming with us?\" Credan asked.": "\"你不和我们一起去吗？\" 克里坦问道。",
	"\"Coming with you? Into that?\" The small topaz dragon nodded at the gate. \"I beg your pardon! Hardly. No, you've already got Corovaxinar on your side—I would be useless. A trifle.

But he really wasn't going.": "\"和你一起去？进入那个？\" 小小的黄玉龙对着大门点了点头。\"请您原谅！\"。很难说。不，你已经有了科罗瓦辛纳在你身边，我就没用了。一个小人物。此外，一个年轻的圣人与五个坚强的英雄相比有什么用！\" 他在戏弄他们。但他真的不打算去。",
	"Meliora walked back to him. She'd grown and was now a little taller than the topaz wyrmling. \"But we need you,\" she said, her eyes watering.": "梅丽奥拉走回他身边。她已经长大了，现在比黄玉色的巫师高一点了。\"但我们需要你，\"她说，她的眼睛在流泪。",
	"\"Ah, you like me, and for that am I flattered, lady. But you do not need me. Think back to all you've done. What hand did I play? A humble narrator, little more.

	"\"Meliora,\" he said, and she turned back.": "\"梅丽奥拉，\"他说，她回头。",
	"\"To answer your question,\" Irdy said, walking forward. His voice in her mind was quiet. She knew only she could hear him now. \"I will always remember you,\" Irdizavonax, the topaz wyrmling, said, his wide milky eyes looking up at her in wonder.": "\"为了回答你的问题，\"伊迪说，向前走去。他在她心中的声音是安静的。她知道现在只有她能听到他。\"我会永远记住你的。\"伊迪萨沃纳克斯，黄玉色的巫师，说，他宽大的乳白色眼睛好奇地看着她。",

	"\"Goodbye, tiny humans!\" He waved to them as Meliora joined her friends, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. \"And good luck.\"": "\"再见，小小的人类！\" 当梅丽奥拉加入她的朋友们时，他向他们挥手，用袍子的袖子擦拭她的眼睛。\"祝你好运。\"",
	"The children stepped through the portal. Lady Eweshtleth saluted Irdizavonax with her rapier, and followed.": "孩子们走过了门户。艾维斯特莱思夫人用她的剑锋向伊迪萨沃纳克斯致敬，然后跟了上去。",

What...?\"": "\"我知道。你以前也这么说过。但是......这次我没有召见你。\" 克里丹比他的同伴们以前看到的更大胆。这是他的领域，他的生意，当涉及到召唤他的圣人时，他的立场更加坚定。\"你是什么......为什么现在？什么......\"？",

	"Like the Celestial Court, the Inexorables do not have distinct psychologies, being more a manifestation of a deity. So while they can and do speak, it's not clear what their intention in the Mundane World is. They hate the violation of law, this much is clear, but their notion of what counts as a \"law\" is alien to mortal minds.": "像天庭一样，Inexorables没有独特的心理，更多的是一种神灵的表现形式。因此，虽然他们能够而且确实在说话，但不清楚他们在世俗世界的意图是什么。他们讨厌违反法律，这一点很清楚，但他们对什么是 \"法律 \"的概念与凡人的思想格格不入。",
	"How many Inexorables there are, no one knows. Only those who have visited the Five Cities of Ordos, the capital city of Axiom, can say. It is known that there are Inexorables greater and lesser than those described here. Probably there's an Inexorable for the Law of Whichever Side of the USB Cable You Try First Will Always Be the Wrong Side, but it'd be like CR 1/2 and probably an adorable little maniac.": "有多少Inexorables，没有人知道。只有那些访问过鄂尔多斯五城（Axiom的首都）的人才能说。众所周知，有比这里描述的更大和更小的Inexorables。可能有一个 \"USB电缆的哪一面你首先尝试总是错误的一面 \"法则的不可抗力，但它就像CR 1/2，可能是一个可爱的小疯子。",
	"The Inexorables are primarily infantry, eschewing ranged attacks, which limits them severely. The flip side of this is: they're very easy to run.": "Inexorables主要是步兵，摒弃了远程攻击，这严重限制了他们。这一点的反面是：他们非常容易跑。",
	"Each Inexorable has their own Law, and there are many Laws. But one force the Inexorables universally hate is magic. Magic is chaos made manifest. Magic is the tool chaos uses to disrupt the world.": "每个Inexorable都有自己的法则，而且有许多法则。但有一种力量是Inexorables普遍讨厌的，那就是魔法。魔法是混沌的表现。魔法是混沌用来扰乱世界的工具。",
	"Almost all the Inexorables are vulnerable to magic. It interferes with the perfect order of their logic and, moreover, it offends them. Its existence is anathema. Some Inexorables, however, can overcome this revulsion and maintain their purpose in the face of discord.": "几乎所有的Inexorables都容易受到魔法的影响。它干扰了他们逻辑的完美秩序，此外，它还冒犯了他们。魔法的存在是一种憎恨。然而，有些Inexorables可以克服这种厌恶感，并在不和谐的情况下保持他们的目的。",
	"The forces of Law that grant the Inexorables the power to travel the planes, arriving when summoned to repair the damaged fabric of reality, also prevent their duty from being interfered with. When it comes to denying the Inexorables the opportunity to pursue their purpose, even the chaos of magic cannot stop them. The Inexorables are immune to any effects that would slow them or deny them actions or movement.": "法律的力量赋予了Inexorables穿梭于各个星球的力量，当被召唤来修复受损的现实结构时，也阻止了他们的职责被干涉。当涉及到剥夺Inexorables追求其目的的机会时，即使是混乱的魔法也无法阻止他们。Inexorables对任何会减慢他们的速度或拒绝他们的行动或移动的影响都是免疫的。",
	"Large-scale battles have been part of the fantasy genre since Tolkien invented it in 1937 with The Hobbit and the Battle of Five Armies but, tellingly, that entire battle happens offscreen while Bilbo is knocked out.": "自从托尔金在1937年的《霍比特人和五军之战》中发明了大规模的战斗以来，大规模的战斗一直是奇幻小说的一部分，但有趣的是，在比尔博被击倒的时候，整个战斗发生在屏幕之外。",
	"Like that battle, warfare in the game has always been something the GM was expected to handwave away.

It's up to supplements like this to cover that material.": "就像那场战役一样，游戏中的战争一直都是期望GM能够挥霍掉的东西。对于核心游戏来说，这很好，它足以涵盖管理小规模冲突和RPG中可能发生的其他一切。这就需要像这样的补充资料来涵盖这些材料。",
	"Raising an army is a meaningful part of this book, and it plays heavily into the next book, {@footnote {@i Kingdoms & Warfare}|{@i Kingdoms & Warfare} by Matt Colville is currently unconverted for 5etools.}. Building a stronghold is only the beginning. The region around the stronghold becomes your demesne, and you might want to grow it beyond a single province and gain more power and influence. And in any event, as a GM I've always assumed the last step in acquiring a stronghold is {@i defending it in battle against those who would take it from you}.": "组建军队是本书的一个有意义的部分，它在下一本书中发挥了很大的作用，{@footnote {@i Kingdoms & Warfare}|{@i Kingdoms & Warfare}作者Matt Colville目前尚未为5etools.}转换。建立一个据点只是一个开始。要塞周围的地区会成为你的领地，你可能想把它发展到一个省之外，获得更多的权力和影响力。而且无论如何，作为一个GM，我一直认为获得据点的最后一步是（%2%）。",
	"To this end, we present a system for resolving epic battles featuring hundreds or thousands of combatants on a side. Since that system gets an entire book after this one, we present only those bits you'll need to get the job done.": "为此，我们提出了一个解决以数百或数千名战斗人员为一方的史诗般的战斗的系统。由于该系统在这本书之后还有一整本书，所以我们只介绍那些你需要完成工作的部分。",
	"One core assumption of this system is: 5th Edition players are already playing a very complex game and should not be expected to also play a whole other wargame.": "这个系统的一个核心假设是：第五版的玩家已经在玩一个非常复杂的游戏了，不应该指望他们还能玩一个完整的其他战争游戏。",
	"You may disagree with that. You might think that having a complete, robust, epic-scale miniatures wargame for 5th Edition would be keen. And I would agree with you! But you and I are not the only people to consider.": "你可能不同意这一点。你可能认为第五版有一个完整的、强大的、史诗规模的迷你模型战棋游戏会很有吸引力。我也会同意你的观点 但你和我并不是唯一需要考虑的人。",
	"Because every table I've played at had one or two players who loved wargames, one or two who didn't feel strongly about them one way or the other, and one or two who really didn't want to play a wargame of any sort. They showed up to play their character and had no interest in running an army.": "因为我玩过的每张桌子都有一两个热爱战争游戏的玩家，一两个对战争游戏没有强烈的感觉，还有一两个真的不想玩任何形式的战争游戏。他们来玩他们的角色，对管理军队没有兴趣。",
	"This system, therefore, is opt-in. You can award your players units, they can hire mercenary units, they can build a stronghold and attract units, and they may use them in battle. But a player who finds warfare distasteful can literally ignore it all, and while the other players are commanding an army, they'll just be playing their characters. While you can use this system all by itself to resolve a battle—or use the rules in {@book Appendix: Simple Warfare|SaF|11} (page 241) for something even faster and more streamlined—this system assumes a battle (clash of armies) takes place at the {@b same time} as an encounter (PCs fighting monsters and bad guys). While the heroes fight the villains in the castle courtyard, their armies clash outside.": "因此，这个系统是选择进入的。你可以授予你的玩家单位，他们可以雇佣雇佣兵单位，他们可以建立一个据点并吸引单位，他们可以在战斗中使用它们。但是，一个认为战争令人厌恶的玩家可以从字面上忽略这一切，当其他玩家在指挥军队的时候，他们只是在玩他们的角色。虽然你可以单独使用这个系统来解决战斗--或者使用{@book Appendix: Simple Warfare|SaF|11}（第241页）中的规则来实现更快、更精简的解决--但这个系统假设战斗（军队的冲突）是在{@b same time}作为遭遇战（NPC与怪物和坏人战斗）发生的。当英雄们在城堡的院子里与坏蛋们战斗时，他们的军队在外面发生冲突。",
	"This system deploys a lot of jargon that evokes the feel of real strategy and tactics—\"heavy infantry,\" \"flanking,\" \"morale\"—and those terms all have real mechanical meaning. But we don't track position at all. The Order of Battle (page 239) describes which units that a unit can legally attack, but {@b the physical positions of your units are entirely abstract}. The armies clash outside the castle walls, or over the nearby hill, or along the road leading to the town, but we don't worry about where the units are standing, or how far away they are from each other, or which unit is next to which. We presume the armies know how to do their job and are doing their best to maintain position and carry out orders.": "这个系统部署了很多行话，唤起了真实战略和战术的感觉--\"重装步兵\"、\"侧翼\"、\"士气\"--而这些术语都有真实的机械意义。但我们根本不追踪位置。战斗顺序（第239页）描述了一个单位可以合法地攻击哪些单位，但（%0%）。军队在城堡墙外，或在附近的山上，或在通往城镇的道路上发生冲突，但我们并不担心单位站在哪里，或它们彼此之间有多远，或哪个单位在哪个单位旁边。我们假定军队知道如何做他们的工作，并且正在尽最大努力保持位置和执行命令。",
	"Likewise, {@b we do not track individual soldiers} nor do we worry overmuch about exactly how big a unit is. The typical Medium Infantry unit is assumed to be 100 soldiers, give or take. A group of 12 knights could be a unit unto themselves, and they would have very good stats indeed, but a very small casualty die (probably a d4, see {@book The Casualty Die|SaF|11|The Casualty Die on page 242).": "同样，（%0%）我们也不太担心一个单位到底有多大。典型的中型步兵单位被认为是100名士兵，或多或少。一组12名骑士可以自成一个单位，他们确实会有很好的属性，但伤亡模子非常小（可能是d4，见{@book The Casualty Die|SaF|11|The Casualty Die on page 242）。",

	"I know that sounds like I'm exaggerating, but that's a real example of a complaint that stuck in my head.": "我知道这听起来像是我在夸大其词，但这是一个真实的例子，是一个停留在我脑中的抱怨。",
	"It's perfectly reasonable in an RPG about heroic fantasy to expect your hero to be the key figure in a war. But in my opinion, if that's the kind of game you want to run...you don't really need a system for warfare. If you're running a game where the outcome of an entire war depends on the actions of one character or a small group...you've got a whole fantasy RPG for that! That sounds like a great adventure!": "在一个关于英雄幻想的RPG游戏中，期望你的英雄成为战争中的关键人物是完全合理的。但在我看来，如果那是你想运行的游戏......你并不真的需要一个战争系统。如果你运行的游戏中，整个战争的结果取决于一个角色或一个小团体的行动......你可以有一个完整的幻想RPG来实现这一点 这听起来是一个很好的冒险!",
	"There are plenty of examples of this in the canon. WWII was certainly a war, but WWII movies aren't about armies—they're about small groups of heroes who alone make the difference. An RPG party, in other words. Look ye to The Dirty Dozen or Where Eagles Dare or Inglorious Basterds.": "这方面的例子在典籍中比比皆是。二战当然是一场战争，但二战电影并不是关于军队的，而是关于一小群英雄的故事，他们独自做出了改变。换句话说，就是一个RPG党。你可以看看《十恶不赦》（The Dirty Dozen）或《鹰击长空》（Where Eagles Dare）或《无耻之徒》。",
	"Instead we accept that warfare in the game is essentially the same as real medieval warfare, and the existence of wizards and clerics doesn't render armies obsolete—because, again, if that is your philosophy, you don't need rules—it just makes armies more interesting.": "相反，我们接受游戏中的战争与真实的中世纪战争基本相同，而魔法师和牧师的存在并没有使军队过时--因为，同样，如果这是你的哲学，你不需要规则--它只是使军队更有趣。",
	"All commanders yearn for a tactical masterpiece, a la the Battle of Cannae, whereby through careful planning, expert maneuvering, and a little luck, one side executes a perfect encirclement of the other.": "所有的指挥官都渴望有一个战术上的杰作，就像坎尼之战那样，通过精心的计划、专业的操纵和一点运气，一方对另一方实施了完美的包围。",
	"But even under these ideal conditions, the battle isn't won when the last soldier is killed—that is a deeply ahistorical notion. The battle is over as soon as one army breaks morale and runs. Archeological diggings bear this out: the heaviest casualties were not inflicted on the site of the battle, but along the path of the fleeing army.": "但是，即使在这些理想的条件下，当最后一个士兵被杀时，战斗并没有胜利--这是一个非常不符合历史的概念。只要有一支军队打垮士气并逃跑，战斗就结束了。考古发掘证明了这一点：最严重的伤亡不是在战斗现场造成的，而是沿着逃跑的军队的路径造成的。",
	"So, morale is critical. Every unit has a Morale score—its ability to deal with adversity and the unexpected without freaking out. Your units will make lots of Morale checks, and failing a Morale check is just as devastating to a unit as its soldiers dying.": "因此，士气是至关重要的。每个单位都有一个士气分数--它处理逆境和意外的能力，而不至于吓坏了。你的部队将进行大量的士气检查，而士气检查失败对部队的破坏力就像士兵死亡一样大。",
	"This is something all field commanders quickly learn: Killing a soldier with sword or pike is long, dangerous, bloody business. But if you can cause a soldier to panic, if you can convince them the battle is lost before it's begun, if you can throw their unit into disarray, then you have won.": "这是所有战地指挥官很快就能学会的事情。用剑或长矛杀死一个士兵是漫长、危险、血腥的事情。但是，如果你能使一个士兵惊慌失措，如果你能让他们相信战斗尚未开始就已经失败，如果你能使他们的部队陷入混乱，那么你就赢了。",
	"A soldier who quits the field and runs away is tactically no different than a dead soldier. Neither contributes their might to their unit anymore, and the unit is diminished as a result. If enough soldiers panic and flee, the unit disbands. An entire unit can be annihilated without a soldier ever dying. Because a unit is not merely a collection of soldiers—it is their ability to move, take orders, and fight in a coordinated fashion. Attack that ability, and you attack the unit.": "一个退出战场并逃跑的士兵在战术上与一个死去的士兵没有区别。两者都不能再为他们的部队贡献力量，而部队也因此被削弱了。如果有足够多的士兵惊慌失措地逃跑，那么这个部队就会解散。整个部队可以在没有士兵死亡的情况下被歼灭。因为一个单位不仅仅是一个士兵的集合--它是他们移动、接受命令和协调作战的能力。攻击这种能力，你就会攻击这个单位。",
	"The good news is, soldiers who run away actually do live to fight another day, and units that break morale in one battle can, under certain circumstances, be reformed to fight in the next battle.": "好消息是，逃跑的士兵实际上确实能活到下一天，在一场战斗中打破士气的部队在某些情况下可以被改造，参加下一场战斗。",

	"Of course, no adventure goes according to plan. The PCs will invariably throw these well-laid schemes into chaos, and they'll have to improvise.

	"One of our stretch goals was an adventure using these rules...and this is it! Some of you may be familiar with it if you've watched my original campaign diaries. They basically begin right before the action in this adventure. There are several ways to get a stronghold: a local noble awards one, you buy one, or—perhaps the most common: you clear out a ruin and say, \"Let's make this our base!\" So we use this adventure to show off arguably the most complex iteration of these rules: The players clear out a castle infested with orcs, become embroiled in the local political landscape, and must decide how they're going to use their new stronghold. (Is it a castle with a keep, tower, and temple inside? Or just a huge keep? Not an insignificant question when an enemy army is bearing down on you!)": "我们的扩展目标之一是使用这些规则进行冒险......而这就是它！如果你看了我最初的活动日记，你可能对它很熟悉。如果你们看了我的原始活动日记，你们中的一些人可能会对它感到熟悉。它们基本上是在这次冒险的行动之前开始的。有几种方法可以得到一个据点：当地贵族授予一个，你买一个，或者--也许是最常见的：你清理出一个废墟，然后说，\"让我们把这个作为我们的基地！\" 所以我们用这个冒险来展示这些规则的最复杂的迭代。玩家清除了一个被兽人侵扰的城堡，卷入了当地的政治格局中，并且必须决定如何使用他们的新据点。(这座城堡里面是有堡垒、塔楼和神庙吗？还是只是一个巨大的堡垒？当敌人的军队向你压来时，这不是一个无关紧要的问题！)",
	"I wrote the outline for this adventure and had already run it two or three times in my own games, but to minimize the impact on our production schedule, I asked James Haeck to write it.

When Bonebreaker Dorokor sent a scout to claim the promised artifact, Saxton killed the orc emissary and sent his knights across the countryside, nailing death warrants for Bonebreaker Dorokor and her White Tusk orcs in every tavern in every village they came across.": "萨克斯顿作为摄政者的第一个行动就是双规了他的兽人棋子。当Bonebreaker Dorokor派了一名侦察员来索取承诺的神器时，萨克斯顿杀死了兽人使者，并派他的骑士穿越乡村，在他们遇到的每个村庄的每个酒馆里为Bonebreaker Dorokor和她的白牙兽人钉上了死亡令牌。",
	"Lord Saxton envied his friend, the old baron, and felt he was better suited to rule. His lust for power turned him into a traitor long ago. He enjoys pitting the people of Bedegar against their humanoid neighbors, reveling in atrocity as long as the victims aren't humans. Thus does he tighten his iron grip on the people of Bedegar.": "萨克斯顿勋爵羡慕他的朋友，老男爵，觉得他更适合统治。他对权力的欲望使他在很久以前就变成了一个叛徒。他喜欢让贝迪格的人与他们的人形邻居对立起来，只要受害者不是人类，他就陶醉于暴行。因此，他加强了对贝迪格尔人民的铁腕控制。",

Sir Pelliton took his from the constellation of the Tower, long a symbol of tyrannical strength.}是一个专制的强人，他将自己真正的懦弱隐藏在贵族身份和他的上司萨克斯顿勋爵的权力的烟幕之后。他还拥有邪恶的力量，这要归功于他与一个黑暗的灵魂所达成的超自然的交易。他是格雷夫斯福德众所周知的小霸王，习惯于拿走他想要的东西，让任何人都不敢违抗他。",
	"Pelliton takes great pleasure in making other people fear and hate him, and whenever someone lashes out in anger, he strikes them down with sadistic glee. He rarely kills his victims, instead preferring to leave them covered with scars and just alive enough to grow his legendary infamy.": "佩里顿以让别人恐惧和憎恨他为乐，每当有人愤怒地挥拳相向时，他就会以虐待狂的方式将其击倒。他很少杀死他的受害者，而是更喜欢让他们满身伤痕，只留下足够的生命力来增加他的传奇性恶名。",

	"Her fanatical devotion to {@footnote Grole|The god of the orcs in my world.} is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness.

	"Despite her cunning, Dorokor knows little of the ways of human diplomacy. She assumes that humans are weak and, should you capture one, they will give up much to recover them. During the adventure, she initiates negotiations in the same way that Saxton dealt with her: she kidnaps a young woman from the nearby town of Gravesford and will only release her if they agree to parley. She reacts with confusion and hostility if the heroes arrive at her keep and attack. Dorokor's Common is simple but fluent. When speaking in Orc, however, she uses grandiose and often poetic turns of phrase.": "尽管多罗克尔很狡猾，但她对人类的外交方式知之甚少。她认为人类是软弱的，如果你抓住一个人，他们会放弃很多东西来找回他们。在冒险过程中，她以萨克斯顿对付她的方式启动了谈判：她从附近的格雷夫斯福德镇绑架了一名年轻女子，只有在他们同意谈判时才会释放她。如果英雄们到达她的堡垒并进行攻击，她的反应是困惑和敌意。多罗克尔的普通话简单而流利。然而，当她用兽人语说话时，她会使用宏大的、经常是诗意的短语。",

	"Other farmers are more sympathetic than \"Duke Carroc,\" as folk might grumble while drinking at the tavern. One farmer in particular, a sun-baked and calloused grandmother named Helanna, is quite fond of adventurers and their stories of danger and distant lands. She doesn't have the money or social power that Carroc's family wields, but she is beloved by all the common folk in Gravesford.": "其他农民比 \"卡洛克公爵 \"更有同情心，就像民间在酒馆喝酒时可能抱怨的那样。特别是一位农民，一位被太阳晒得满脸老茧的祖母，名叫海兰娜，她相当喜欢冒险家和他们关于危险和远方的故事。她没有卡洛克家族所拥有的金钱和社会权力，但她受到格雷夫斯福德所有平民百姓的爱戴。",
	"In the center of Gravesford is a market square. Most of the week, the square is empty except perhaps for children running about with sticks, pretending to be knights. The PCs, however, arrive in Gravesford on market day. Once a fortnight on this day, the square is transformed into a wild scene of colors and scents. All the artisans and farmers in town—including Jago and Morgouse, and the town's tanners and leatherworkers, woodworkers, stonemasons, millers, bakers, butchers, and others—set up shop in the market square and sell their wares. Just outside of the main market square is Tradesfolks' Way, a small alley where local farmers trade goods to one another. {@b Any {@filter item in the core rulebooks worth less than 10 gp|items|source=phb;dmg;mm|cost=[0;10]|miscellaneous=!magic|type=!modern;!renaissance;!futuristic} can be purchased from the traders at the Gravesford market.}": "在格雷夫斯福德的中心有一个市场广场。一周中的大部分时间，广场都是空的，也许只有孩子们拿着棍子跑来跑去，假装是骑士。然而，NPC在集市日来到了格雷夫福德。每两周一次的这一天，广场会变成一个充满色彩和气味的狂野场景。镇上所有的工匠和农民--包括Jago和Morgouse，以及镇上的制革工人、木工、石匠、磨坊主、面包师、屠夫和其他人都在市场广场上开店，出售他们的商品。在主市场广场外有一条Tradesfolks'Way，这是一条小巷子，当地农民在这里互相交易货物。(可以从格雷夫斯福德市场的商贩那里购买（%0%）。",
	"Pinna also sets up a stall in the market square, but she is usually too busy conjuring bouquets and playing with the children to actually sell any goods.

	"The Church of St. Gaed the Confessor is one of the oldest buildings in Gravesford—after the Reluctant Pig, of course. Its wooden beams need repair, but it is still the cultural center of the village, and Gravesford gathers here for all sorts of occasions, not just on holy days. The stained glass window depicting Saint Gaed in black armor smiting the traitor saint, Hylae the Corrupt, is the most astonishing piece of art anyone in town has ever seen. When the sun hits it, it's like a laser light show.": "圣盖德忏悔者教堂是格雷夫斯福最古老的建筑之一--当然是在不情愿的猪之后。它的木梁需要修理，但它仍然是村庄的文化中心，格雷夫斯福德在各种场合都会聚集在这里，不仅仅是在神圣的日子。描绘圣-盖德身穿黑色盔甲击打叛徒圣人海莱的彩色玻璃窗，是镇上任何人见过的最令人惊讶的艺术品。当太阳照射到它时，它就像一场激光灯表演。",
	"The church is run by Father Belderone, a priest of St. Gaed. He is a city man from Bedegar Keep, and it's reflected in his rapid, matter-of-fact speech, but the villagers treat him as one of their own. While several priests tend to the church, Father Belderone is its only cleric. He uses {@creature priest} statistics with the following changes:": "教堂由圣盖德的牧师贝尔德隆神父管理。他是一个来自贝德加堡的城市人，这反映在他快速、实事求是的讲话中，但村民们把他当作自己人。虽然有几位牧师在照料教堂，但贝尔德隆神父是教堂唯一的牧师。他使用{@creature priest}的统计数据，但有以下变化。",

	"A local priest, like Father Belderone, will be primarily concerned with the people's welfare. Village healers tend not to be foaming fanatics spouting doctrine at everyone. That kind of attitude doesn't survive long when you're living elbow-to-elbow with real people.": "像Belderone神父这样的当地牧师，将主要关注人民的福祉。村里的医护人员往往不是对所有人大谈教义的狂热分子。当你与真实的人生活在一起时，这种态度是不能长久的。",
	"So, Father Belderone is likely to spout a lot of folk wisdom first, then some general tenets of Cavall (\"Man cannot live where injustice thrives.\"), then something specific from Saint Gaed only in extreme moments.": "因此，贝尔德隆神父可能会先说很多民间智慧，然后说一些卡瓦尔的一般信条（\"人不能生活在不公正的地方。\"），然后只有在极端的时刻才会说一些圣盖德的具体内容。",

	"In my setting and novels, the people do not worship gods directly. Instead, they serve saints who act as interlocutors for the gods.

Heroes in life, the saints died and joined their gods, who award the priests who serve them with special abilities.": "在我的设定和小说中，人们并不直接崇拜神灵。相反，他们侍奉圣人，圣人作为神的对话者。为什么会这样从来没有解释过，但其含义是，神是不可言说和不可知的，而圣人是他们曾经的译者。生活中的英雄，圣人死后加入他们的神灵，神灵授予为他们服务的祭司以特殊能力。",
	"Gaed is a saint of Cavall. Cavall is one of the two \"good\" gods in this part of the world, and can be easily replaced with any lawful good god from your world who is primarily concerned with justice.

	"Gaed exposed this devil and did battle with it. He lost the battle and his life, but exposed a deadly conspiracy and saved the king and the kingdom. He forced the devil to reveal its true nature, and Cavall canonized him immediately as the Confessor, saint of exposing secrets and foiling conspiracies. It was Gaed who died at the hands of the devil spy. It was Saint Gaed the Confessor, now immortal, who returned and slew the devil.": "盖德揭露了这个魔鬼，并与它做了斗争。他在战斗中输掉了自己的生命，但却揭露了一个致命的阴谋，拯救了国王和王国。他迫使魔鬼暴露了它的真面目，卡瓦尔立即将他封为忏悔者，是揭露秘密和挫败阴谋的圣人。正是盖德死于魔鬼间谍之手。现在不死的忏悔者盖德才是圣人，他回来并杀死了魔鬼。",
	"The oldest building in Gravesford is the Reluctant Pig, a two-story inn with a moss-covered roof constructed from the same stone as the Gravesford Bridge.

She tolerates no violence in her bar, keeping a {@item mace|phb} by the taps in case of trouble. (She uses {@creature veteran} statistics.) She is, however, terrified of Sir Pelliton and the Knights of the Three Roses, and will not interfere with any quarrel between them and her patrons. She personally knew the vile Star Knight back when his cadre were simply mercenaries known as the Thorns, and still bears the scars from their last two meetings. Her husband, Gowan, is torn between his desire to protect his wife and the sure knowledge that Sir Pelliton would kill him in a moment just to make a point. It is for this reason that Giselle has been careful not to confront Pelliton if her husband is around.": "猪的主人是吉赛尔和高文以及他们的女儿布雷卡（{@adventure page 104|SaF|1|Giselle and Gowan|0}）。虽然一家人分工合作，但吉赛尔是经营生意的人，并出席镇议会的会议。她不容忍在她的酒吧里出现暴力，在水龙头旁放着一个{@item mace|phb}，以防出现麻烦。(她使用{@creature veteran}的统计数字）。然而，她很害怕佩里顿爵士和三玫瑰骑士团，不会干涉他们和她的顾客之间的任何争吵。她亲自认识这位卑鄙的星际骑士，当时他的手下还只是被称为荆棘的雇佣兵，现在还带着他们最后两次会面的伤痕。她的丈夫戈万在保护妻子的愿望和佩里顿爵士为了表明自己的观点会马上杀了他的肯定认知之间纠结。正是由于这个原因，吉赛尔一直很小心，如果她的丈夫在身边，就不会与佩里顿对抗。",

	"Deeper in the forest, the constricting trees choke out light until the bright day turns to dim twilight, and no illumination penetrates the forest during nighttime.

Did he {@i know} orcs govern by right of combat? Or did he guess at it?": "多罗科把埃德蒙-贝德加囚禁在她个人房间附近的一个舒适房间里。反正以兽人的标准来说，是很舒服的。作为俘虏的第一天，埃德蒙要求与多罗克尔单挑，声称他作为同族首领的权利。其他兽人都笑了起来，但多罗克尔用怀疑的眼光看着这个年轻的人类。他{@i know}兽人通过战斗的权利来管理吗？还是他猜测的？",
	"She indulged him, and stepped into the makeshift cage they created for him. Handing him a shortsword, she faced the young baron without a weapon of her own.

	"If the PCs try to kill their way through the orcs to rescue Pinna, Dorokor will not hesitate to threaten Edmund's life first, or Pinna's, and she means it. She will show some confusion at the PCs' tactics, as she believed that holding captives would force negotiations.

Only one, a squeamish runt named Glurpick, managed to escape. He fled for weeks, but after many trials he came into the presence of Sir Pelliton.

	"The PCs have a little time to travel around to nearby villages and recruit allies to help them defend Castle Rend. If the PCs found it, the castle's hidden treasury has a great deal of gold to facilitate the hiring of mercenaries from nearby Tarreton, and there are woodworkers and stonemasons in Gravesford and other nearby hamlets that could be paid to rebuild the castle's crumbling fortifications.

	"Even if they don't have a keep, even if they don't have any money, there's nothing stopping the PCs from going to the NPCs they've met and helped and just {@i asking} for aid.

	"Sir Pelliton arrives with his wizard Curor and six other allies in the flash of a {@spell teleport} spell read from a scroll. The PCs can see the scroll in Curor's hand turning to dust as the magic is expended. He's casting the spell from a scroll because he is not high enough level to know the spell. Here are the enemies in the encounter:": "Pelliton爵士带着他的巫师Coror和其他六个盟友，在从卷轴上读出的{@spell teleport}咒语的闪光中来到了这里。NPC可以看到Curor手中的卷轴随着魔法的消耗而变成了灰尘。他用卷轴施法是因为他的等级还不够高，不知道这个法术。下面是这次遭遇战中的敌人。",

	"The players may want to ignore the encounter and, for instance, try to go outside and take out the catapults themselves.": "玩家可能想忽略这个遭遇，比如说，试着到外面去，自己把投石器干掉。",
	"Doing this means surrendering the defense of the castle, in which case Sir Pelliton opens the gates. The castle no longer provides any Morale bonus to the players' troops but worse, the levies immediately flee (their heroes quit the field!) the orcs leave for the same reason, and all remaining ally troops must make a DC 15 Morale check or suffer one casualty. If the heroes want the benefits of the stronghold as a fortification and its psychological value to their troops, they must stay and defend it.": "这样做意味着交出城堡的防御，在这种情况下，佩里顿爵士打开了城门。城堡不再为玩家的部队提供任何士气奖励，但更糟糕的是，征兵队立即逃离（他们的英雄退出战场！）兽人也因为同样的原因离开，所有剩余的盟友部队必须进行DC15士气检查，否则就会遭受一次伤亡。如果英雄们想要获得据点作为防御工事的好处，以及它对部队的心理价值，他们就必须留下并保卫它。",
	"The players have the units they recruited, as well as Castle Rend itself. Sir Pelliton arrives with the following units: {@optfeature Saxton's Riders|SaF}, {@optfeature Bedegar Archers|SaF}, {@optfeature Catapults|SaF}, {@optfeature Bedegar Company of Foot|SaF}, and {@optfeature Redclaw Demonrunners|SaF}. The gnolls may be a surprise, but it's merely a sign that Lord Saxton is in league with fell powers.": "玩家拥有他们所招募的单位，以及Rend城堡本身。佩里顿爵士带着以下单位来到这里：{@optfeature Saxton's Riders|SaF}、{@optfeature Bedegar Archers|SaF}、{@optfeature Catapults|SaF}、{@optfeature Bedegar Company of Foot|SaF}和{@optfeature Redclaw Demonrunners|SaF}。地精可能是一个惊喜，但这只是一个迹象，表明萨克斯顿勋爵与堕落势力结盟。",
	"In the full warfare rules ({@book page 233|SaF|10}), units have Commanders: NPC allies to the heroes who command their units on the battlefield and give the units access to many more maneuvers than are presented here.": "在完整的战争规则（（%0%））中，单位有指挥官。英雄的NPC盟友，他们在战场上指挥他们的单位，并让单位获得比这里介绍的更多的机动性。",
	"But the simple warfare rules ({@book page 243|SaF|11}) let the players just run their units without assuming their PCs have any direct control over anything. We assume the units have sergeants commanding them, and the players control the sergeants.": "但是简单的战争规则({@book page 243|SaF|11})让玩家只是运行他们的单位，而不假设他们的NPC对任何东西有直接控制。我们假设单位有军士指挥，而玩家则控制军士。",
	"Pelliton is perfectly happy to focus on the heroes' peasant levies—in fact, this is an excellent way to put down a rebellion. He doesn't have any levies, so casualties go directly to his infantry, but he does have his gnoll allies to soak some damage.": "佩里顿非常乐意集中精力对付英雄们的农民军--事实上，这是平定叛乱的一个绝佳方法。他没有征兵，所以伤亡直接降临到他的步兵身上，但他有他的地精盟友来承受一些伤害。",
	"If the players have any archers, he orders his cavalry to attack them. This can be devastating, as archers are squishy and cavalry is...not.": "如果玩家有任何弓箭手，他就命令他的骑兵去攻击他们。这可能是毁灭性的，因为弓箭手很脆弱，而骑兵...不是。",
	"Meanwhile, his catapults hammer the players' castle.": "同时，他的弹射器锤击玩家的城堡。",
	"{@b If Sir Pelliton dies,} his army surrenders. The gnolls disband and flee into the forest, and Pelliton's remaining allies lay down their arms. They hope, they presume, the PCs will ransom them back to Lord Saxton. How successful that is depends on what kind of villain you think Saxton is.": "{@b If Sir Pelliton dies,}他的军队投降了。地精们解散并逃入森林，佩里顿剩下的盟友也放下了武器。他们希望，他们推测，NPC会把他们赎回给萨克斯顿大人。成功与否取决于你认为萨克斯顿是个什么样的恶棍。",
	"{@b If Pelliton's infantry is eliminated,} the cavalry retreat, and the gnolls disband. The cavalry aren't going to fight without an army, and the gnolls are certainly not going to fight without the knight they made their bargain with.": "{@b If Pelliton's infantry is eliminated,}骑兵撤退，而地精则解散。骑兵不会在没有军队的情况下作战，而地精也肯定不会在没有与他们达成交易的骑士的情况下作战。",
	"{@b If Castle Rend falls,} the heroes lose their orc allies and their peasant levies, and all remaining units must immediately make a DC 15 Morale check or suffer a casualty.": "{@b If Castle Rend falls,}英雄们失去了他们的兽人盟友和他们的农民军，所有剩下的单位必须立即进行DC15士气检查，否则就会有伤亡。",
	"{@b If the heroes' units are eliminated,} Pelliton and his allies gain an extra attack (not an extra attack action) each round as a Morale bonus.": "{@b If the heroes' units are eliminated,}佩里顿和他的盟友每回合获得一次额外的攻击（不是额外的攻击行动）作为士气奖励。",
	"The players might lose this battle. If they fight to the death and are captured, Sir Pelliton puts them in chains and tries to return them to Bedegar Keep to be executed—giving them many chances to escape!": "玩家可能会输掉这场战斗。如果他们拼死一搏并被俘，佩里顿爵士会把他们锁起来，并试图把他们送回贝德加堡处死--这给了他们许多逃跑的机会!",
	"If this happens, Sir Pelliton's army invests the keep, and another Knight of Three Roses, Lady Ruth or Sir Anglim, arrives to command the troops while Pelliton returns to Bedegar.": "如果发生这种情况，佩里顿爵士的军队就会侵入堡垒，而另一位三玫瑰骑士，露丝女士或安格林爵士就会赶来指挥部队，而佩里顿则返回贝德加。",
	"Otherwise, we hope the PCs win!": "否则，我们希望个人电脑能够获胜。",
	"The heroes rebuffed Sir Pelliton's army and saved Pinna, and Edmund Bedegar is now free from the orcs' clutches! If you are playing using milestone XP rules, each PC advances to 6th level.": "英雄们回绝了佩里顿爵士的军队，拯救了平纳，埃德蒙-贝德加现在已经从兽人的魔掌中解脱出来了! 如果你使用的是里程碑式的XP规则，每个人的等级都会提升到6级。",
	"More important than XP, however, is Castle Rend! The PCs are now the proud owners of a stronghold of their very own.
