	"Bards of the College of Wyrdsingers subscribe to the wyrd, a philosophy that centers around the phenomenon of the same name. The wyrd is that which will be, inexorably tied to such concepts as destiny and fate. Though some might consider the idea of a fixed destiny fatalistic, the bards of this college are Inspired by this viewpoint. One may not choose the manner of one's death, but one can choose how to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An insect might be caught in a spider's web. Whether it lives or dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety, and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle affects all things, however remotely connected they might be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves not even a ripple behind. To confront fate, to embrace the wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake the world and make it take notice.": "巫师学院的吟游诗人赞同巫术，这是一种围绕同名现象的哲学。巫术是指将会出现的东西，与命运和前途等概念不可分割地联系在一起。虽然有些人可能认为固定的命运是宿命的，但这个学院的吟游诗人却受到这种观点的启发。一个人可能无法选择自己的死亡方式，但可以选择如何去迎接它，这个想法是这个学院的核心所在。一只昆虫可能被卷入蜘蛛的网中。无论它是生是死，它的挣扎最终都会撼动整个网，它可能会通过这种努力来解脱自己。挣扎会影响到所有的事物，无论它们之间的联系有多远，而仅仅接受死亡的昆虫却连一丝涟漪都没有留下。面对命运，拥抱巫术和它带来的一切，就是拥有撼动世界的力量，让它注意到。",

Your ally gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on Attack rolls, Damage Rolls, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws for a number of rounds equal to your bard level. That ally cannot benefit from your Bardic Inspiration until the Duration of this feature has run its course.

Rather than relying on ancient lore or skill with arms, these bards throw themselves into new challenges just to see what happens, trusting in luck to see them through.

You gain Inspiration that is usable only on yourself and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Using this ability causes a chaos magic surge.": "一切都渴望成为别的东西。从14级开始，作为一个动作，幸运窃取者可以将一个已知的法术改变为吟游诗人法术列表中相同或更低级别的另一个法术。在吟游诗人的下一个回合结束时，他或她的已知法术列表恢复正常。使用这个能力会引起混乱的魔法波动。",

Though still nearly universally good, these wayward paladins are more neutral than lawful, and they use their relative freedom to bring their light to bear as they deem it most necessary.": "光明的誓言是黑夜中的灯塔，燃烧掉阴影和不死的腐败。(non-ogl places) see the white-and-yellow plumed helmets of these warriors of light. 辐射型圣骑士大胆而粗暴，厌恶隐身，大踏步地与黑暗势力作战。几乎每个宣誓的圣骑士都是寇斯的崇拜者。光辉之誓的圣骑士绝大多数都是善良的，而且大多数是合法的。有些人拒绝骑士团的严格性质，而选择了游侠的生活。尽管几乎所有的人都是善良的，但这些不守规矩的圣骑士更倾向于中立而非合法，他们利用自己的相对自由，在他们认为最需要的时候发挥他们的光芒。",
	"Paladins who swear the Oath of Radiance devote themselves to fighting the insidious powers of the Shadow Realm that darken mortal hearts and against the undead that extinguish the light of life and replace it with hungry darkness. Most importantly, they take it upon themselves to rescue those corrupted by Shadow or undead influence. They will spare mortal foes in the thrall of darkness in the hope that such creatures can be redeemed.": "宣誓加入 \"光芒之誓 \"的圣骑士们致力于与暗影领域的阴险力量作斗争，这些力量使凡人的心灵变得黑暗，并与那些熄灭生命之光并以饥饿的黑暗取而代之的亡灵作斗争。最重要的是，他们以拯救那些被阴影或亡灵影响的人为己任。他们会放过被黑暗控制的凡人敌人，希望这些生物能够得到救赎。",
	"I will burn out all creatures born of darkness, showing no pity or mercy. I will not suffer the company of dark creatures, save those taken in by darkness who I might redeem.": "我将烧掉所有从黑暗中诞生的生物，不显示任何怜悯或怜悯。我不会遭受黑暗生物的陪伴，除了那些被黑暗俘虏的人，我可以救赎他们。",

	"The oath of the annihilator is as ancient as the Darkness between stars. These paladins—sometimes called antipaladins, dark paladins, or death knights—represent the antithesis of the ideal Paladin.

Despite their extreme viewpoint and often brutal behavior, they still conduct themselves honorably and expect to be treated with respect.": "歼灭者的誓言就像星星之间的黑暗一样古老。这些圣骑士--有时被称为反圣骑士、黑暗圣骑士或死亡骑士--代表了理想圣骑士的反面。发出这种誓言的圣骑士将自己视为神圣的清算工具和末日预言者。尽管他们的观点极端，行为也往往很残忍，但他们仍然表现得很光荣，并期望得到尊重。",

At the end of the first month, you successfully remove any barriers to regrowth such as soil toxins or latent poisonous magic. At the end of the second month, your power reseeds the area with vegetation native to the location. By the end of the third month, the seeds sprout into saplings.

You can stay inside the Shadow connection for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you choose to; while there, you are Invisible, nothing can affect you, and you can't affect anything else. Each use of this ability costs you 4 Sorcery Points.": "在14级时，你获得了在成片的黑暗中穿行的能力。当你被轻度或重度遮蔽时，你可以作为一个额外的行动，穿过一个阴影，从200英尺以外的另一个阴影中走出来。如果你选择的话，你可以在阴影的连接处停留数个回合，相当于你的魅力修正值（最小为1）；在那里，你是隐身的，没有什么可以影响你，你也不能影响其他东西。每次使用这个能力需要消耗你4点巫术点数。",
	"Beginning at 18th level, you can emanate an aura of energy from the Shadow Realm.

	"Unlike many transmuters, who focus on the physical transformation of objects and creatures, alkemancers are concerned with the search for human perfection and immortality, and they use alchemy as a means in this pursuit. Still, there is much crossover between the two specialties. Alkemancers and transmuters can be found working toward the same goals, as both allies and rivals.": "与许多专注于物体和生物的物理转化的转化者不同，炼金术士关注的是对人类完美和不朽的追求，他们将炼金术作为这种追求的一种手段。不过，这两个专业之间还是有很多交叉的地方。炼金术士和转化者可以被发现为相同的目标而工作，既是盟友也是对手。",
	"Alkemancy spells typically blend conjuration, necromancy, and transmutation effects. Few alkemancy spells belong to the schools of evocation or illusion, since spells of these schools summon energy out of nothingness or create things that are not real; both concepts are at odds with the precepts of alkemancy, which seeks to reduce energy and matter to its constituent parts and refine them to a more purified (or useful) state of existence.": "炼金术的法术通常融合了法术、死灵术和转化效果。很少有炼金术属于唤起或幻觉流派，因为这些流派的法术会从虚无中召唤出能量或创造出不真实的东西；这两个概念都与炼金术的戒律相悖，炼金术的目的是将能量和物质还原成其构成部分，并将它们提炼成更纯粹（或有用）的存在状态。",
	"Except as noted below, alkemancers function as wizards and use the wizard spell list.": "除下文所述外，炼金术士的功能与巫师相同，并使用巫师的法术列表。",

Similarly, when you learn a new cantrip, it can be an alkemancy cantrip even if you've never previously encountered it.": "当你获得一个等级时，你为获得一个等级而学习的两个法术中的一个可以是碱液法术，即使你之前从未遇到过该法术。同样地，当你学习一个新的咒语时，即使你之前从未遇到过它，它也可以是一个碱性咒语。",
	"Beginning at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with alchemical supplies if you did not already have it and your proficiency bonus with alchemical supplies is doubled. You also halve the cost of alchemical items you create, enabling you to fashion most basic items in a single day. Finally, you gain proficiency with alchemical weapons, and you add your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls when you use them as weapons.": "从2级开始，如果你还没有熟练掌握炼金术用品，你将获得熟练掌握炼金术用品的能力加成，而且你的炼金术用品的熟练加成会翻倍。你还能将你制造的炼金物品的成本减半，使你能在一天内制造出大多数基本物品。最后，你获得了对炼金武器的熟练度，当你把它们作为武器使用时，你会在它们的伤害卷上加上熟练度加成。",

	"Adding lead to a spell that improves your armor class, such as mage armor or shield, increases the spell's AC bonus by 2. If the spell has a duration longer than 1 round, the duration also increases by a number of additional rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Any visible spell effect modified with lead takes on a dull gray sheen.": "在提高你护甲等级的法术中加入铅，例如法师护甲或盾牌，会使该法术的AC加成增加2。如果该法术的持续时间超过1轮，持续时间也会增加相当于你智力修正值的额外轮数（最小为1）。任何用铅修饰的可见的法术效果都会呈现出暗淡的灰色光泽。",
	"Adding quicksilver to a spell that changes the form of a creature or an object, such as alter self or polymorph, increases the spell's duration by a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

	"Adding quintessence to a necromantic spell that grants temporary hit points, such as false life or life hack, increases the temporary hit points gained by a number equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). Adding quintessence to a spell doesn't change the spell's visible aspects.": "将精髓添加到一个给予临时命中率的死灵法术中，例如假生命或生命黑客，会使获得的临时命中率增加两倍于你的智力修饰值（最低为2）。在一个法术中加入精髓并不改变该法术的可见方面。",
	"Adding salt to a spell that deals acid damage gives the acid a pale, crystalline hue and causes it to become extremely painful. Any creature damaged by the spell must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 points from its Strength and Dexterity scores (rolled separately). These lost points return automatically after a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).": "在造成酸液伤害的法术中加入盐，使酸液呈现苍白的结晶色泽，并使其变得极为痛苦。任何被该法术伤害的生物都必须成功地进行宪法救赎，或者从其力量和灵巧得分中损失1d4分（分别计算）。这些损失的点数在与你的智力修饰值相等的回合后自动恢复（最低为1）。",

Some of those who take the bait have a keen intellect, enabling them to use careful planning that circumvents this damnation—or at least delays it. In this way, power-hungry mages strike bargains and increase their magical might with the knowledge the fiends offer. A master of fiends, as these individuals are called, is either a diabolist (one who deals with devils) or a demonologist (one who traffics with demons). Most common folk care little about the distinction, seeing both simply as servants of evil, but the differences between the two are significant. Diabolists are masters of language and context, knowing that the contracts proffered by devils are complex and meant to mislead, and must be read carefully and fully understood so as to avoid any trickery. Demons have little use for subtlety; they understand and respect only one thing—power. A demonologist must have the magical power to compel such fiends to do their bidding, or they will surely be rent asunder and have their soul carried screaming back to the Abyss by the demon.

The DC of this save increases by 1 for every five levels you gain hereafter, to a maximum of DC 15 at 17th level. On a successful save, your soul is retrieved and the spell works normally. On a failed save, the spell ends and you remain dead. (The GM can opt to allow either you or the caster trying to revive you to strike a bargain that allows you to be raised.

They are rarely encountered outside dwarven nations, but they are easy to recognize thanks to their signature ring-staves.": "戒指守护者专注于转化学派，他们将矮人的手艺与奥术的力量融合在一起。他们很少在矮人国家以外的地方遇到，但由于他们标志性的环状刀，他们很容易被认出。",
	"Except as noted below, ring wardens function as transmuters and use the Wizard spell list.": "除了下面提到的情况，护环员的功能是转化者，并使用魔法师的法术列表。",
	"Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd Level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Transmutation spell into your Spellbook is halved.": "从你在2级时选择这个专长开始，你必须花费一半的金币和时间来复制一个转化法术到你的法术书中。",
	"In addition, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Ring Magic spell into your Spellbook is halved.": "此外，你将环形魔法咒语复制到你的法术书中所必须花费的金币和时间减半。",
	"Also at 2nd Level, you gain Proficiency in your choice of blacksmith's tools or jeweler's tools.": "同样在2级时，你获得对你所选择的铁匠工具或珠宝商工具的熟练度。",
	"At 2nd Level, you create a Special Quarterstaff with two Special metal rings adorning it. When you roll damage for a spell Attack while you hold your ring-staff, you can add your Proficiency bonus to the result. If the spell allows for multiple Damage Rolls against multiple Targets (such as with scorching ray), you must choose which roll gains the benefit before you roll the die. You can use this ability a number of times equal to the number of rings on your staff. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or Long Rest.": "在2级时，你创造了一根特殊的四角杖，上面有两个特殊的金属环装饰着它。当你拿着你的环形长棍时，你可以在结果中加入你的熟练度加成，以进行法术攻击。如果法术允许对多个目标进行多次伤害卷轴（例如炙热射线），你必须在掷骰子之前选择哪个卷轴获得好处。你可以使用这个能力的次数与你法杖上的戒指数量相等。当你完成短时或长时休息时，你会重新获得所有已消耗的使用次数。",

When using your chosen tools to craft nonmagical or magical items, you make twice the normal amount of progress each day.": "从6级开始，当你使用你在2级时选择的工具时，你可以增加两倍的正常熟练度奖励。当使用你选择的工具来制作非魔法或魔法物品时，你每天的进展是正常数量的两倍。",
	"Additionally, you learn the method for Crafting a single kind of magic ring chosen from the following list: ring of Jumping, Ring of Mind Shielding, ring of Protection, Ring of the Ram, Ring of Regeneration, or ring of Resistance. At the GM's discretion, you can choose a ring not listed here. You must meet all the standard Prerequisites for Crafting the ring and pay the required gold as normal, along with providing any Special materials or meeting any Conditions set by the GM.": "此外，你还学会了制作一种魔法戒指的方法，从以下列表中选择：跳跃之戒、心灵屏蔽之戒、保护之戒、公羊之戒、再生之戒、抵抗之戒。根据GM的决定，你可以选择这里没有列出的戒指。你必须满足制作戒指的所有标准先决条件，并像往常一样支付所需的金币，同时提供任何特殊材料或满足GM设定的任何条件。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you can imbue magic into the Special rings that decorate your ring-staff. When you Cast a Spell, instead of having it take Effect normally, you can choose to store the spell in one of the rings. As long as the spell is stored, you can't regain the expended spell slot. You can remove an imbued ring from the staff and give it to another creature (or hold it yourself) as an Action. A creature holding an imbued ring can release the stored spell as an Action. Attack rolls, Saving Throws, and damage are based on the caster who imbued the ring, but the creature holding the ring counts as the spell's caster for all other purposes.": "从10级开始，你可以将魔法注入装饰你的戒杖的特殊戒指中。当你施展法术时，你可以选择将法术储存在其中一个戒指中，而不是让它正常生效。只要咒语被储存起来，你就不能重新获得已消耗的咒语槽。你可以从法杖上取下一个被施法的戒指，并把它送给另一个生物（或自己持有）作为一个行动。持有施法戒指的生物可以以行动的方式释放储存的法术。攻击卷、蓄力攻击和伤害是基于给戒指灌注的施法者，但持有戒指的生物在所有其他方面都算作该法术的施法者。",
	"After you remove an imbued ring from the staff, you must create a new Special ring and affix it to the staff by working for 8 hours and spending 5 gp in raw materials. An imbued ring is considered a magical Effect for the Purpose of Dispel Magic. You can have a number of rings imbued at one time equal to your Proficiency bonus.": "当你从法杖上取下一个被灌输的戒指后，你必须创造一个新的特殊戒指，并通过工作8小时和花费5戈比的原材料将其粘贴在法杖上。为了驱除魔法的目的，一个被灌注的戒指被视为一个魔法效果。你可以在同一时间拥有与你的熟练度奖励相等的戒指数量。",
	"At 14th level or higher, with 1 hour of work (which can be accomplished during a short rest), you can embed a single magic ring that you possess into your ring-staff. The ring's Rarity must be Common, uncommon, or rare. As long as you hold the ring-staff, you gain the Effect of the embedded ring as if you were attuned to it and wearing it (including any negative Effects of attuning to the item, such as curses). This embedded ring doesn't count as one of your three allowable attuned magic items.": "在14级或更高的等级，通过1小时的工作（可以在短暂的休息中完成），你可以将你拥有的一枚魔法戒指嵌入你的戒杖中。戒指的稀有度必须是普通、不普通或稀有。只要你持有戒杖，你就会获得嵌入的戒指的效果，就像你与它相适应并佩戴它一样（包括与物品相适应的任何负面效果，如诅咒）。这个嵌入的戒指并不算作你的三个可允许的附魔物品之一。",
	"With one hour of work, you can remove an embedded ring (along with its attunement) and replace it with a new one if desired.": "通过一小时的工作，你可以取下一个嵌入的戒指（连同它的调和物），如果需要的话，可以用一个新的戒指来代替它。",

	"How to Start: If you're a Wizard who wants to become a timekeeper, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd Level, when you are also entitled to choose an Arcane Tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the timekeeper exclusively, you can forego the selection of an Arcane Tradition and gain the features of the timekeeper specialty instead.": "如何开始。如果你是一个想成为计时员的巫师，你可以在达到2级时做出决定，这时你也有权选择一个奥术传统。如果你决定只走计时员的道路，你可以放弃选择一个奥术传统，而获得计时员专业的特性。",
	"You can also pursue the timekeeper specialty in conjunction with one of the standard Arcane Traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to Temporal Magic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd Level, you choose whether to gain the Temporal Points feature (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, an Abjurer might select Arcane Ward at 2nd Level and Temporal Points at 6th Level, followed by either Projected Ward or Extended Magic at 10th level.": "你也可以结合标准的奥术传统追求时间守护者的专长。如果你选择这样做，你除了获得时空魔术师（如下所述）外，还将获得你所选学派的精明特征。同样在2级时，你可以选择是获得时空点的特性（见下文）还是你所选学派的2级特性。此后，在第6、10和14级时，你可以选择仍然可用的最低级别特征。例如，一个巫师可以在第2层选择奥术防护，在第6层选择时空点，然后在第10层选择投影防护或扩展魔法。",
	"Beginning when you select this school at 2nd Level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a temporal spell into your Spellbook is halved.": "从你在2级时选择这个流派开始，你必须花费一半的金币和时间来复制一个时空法术到你的魔法书中。",
	"Starting at 2nd Level, you gain access to temporal points, which you can spend to acquire benefits. You receive 2 temporal points at 2nd Level, and you gain 1 additional point every time you gain a level, to a maximum of 20 points at 20th level. You regain all spent temporal points when you finish a Long Rest.": "从第2级开始，你可以获得时空点，你可以用它来获得好处。你在第2级时获得2个时空点，你每增加一级就获得1个额外的时空点，到第20级时最多可获得20个。当你完成长期休息时，你会重新获得所有花费的时空点。",
	"You can spend 1 temporal point as a Reaction or a bonus Action on Your Turn to gain one of the following Effects for 1 round:": "你可以在你的回合中花费1个时间点作为反应或奖励行动，以获得下列效果之一，持续1回合。",

	"At 10th level, you add the haste spell to your Spellbook, if you don't have it already. From now on, you never suffer the negative aftereffects of the haste spell and can act normally when the spell ends.": "在10级时，如果你还没有法术书，你可以将急速法术加入你的法术书。从现在开始，你永远不会受到急速法术的负面后遗症，并且在法术结束时可以正常行动。",
	"Also, you can cast haste on yourself without expending a spell slot. Once you cast haste in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest. You can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.": "另外，你可以在不消耗法术槽的情况下对自己施放急速。一旦你以这种方式施放了急速，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。你仍然可以使用一个可用的法术槽来正常施放它。",
	"Starting at 14th level, you can choose to ignore the Effect of a temporal spell that would otherwise affect you. For instance, you can exempt yourself from the Effect of a slow spell cast in the area you occupy. Or, if you would be affected by a Quick Time spell, you can choose to automatically succeed on the saving throw.": "从14级开始，你可以选择忽略原本会影响你的时空法术的效果。例如，你可以免除在你所处区域施放的缓慢法术的效果。或者，如果你会受到一个快速时间法术的影响，你可以选择自动成功地进行拯救。",
	"Also, you can spend temporal points in the following ways.": "另外，你可以通过以下方式花费时间点。",

	"As a Reaction when another creature casts Time Stop, you can spend 5 temporal points to gain the ability to act during the spell's Duration. You and the spell's caster alternate taking turns, with the caster Acting first. You have the same restrictions as the caster. If the caster ends the spell, it ends for everyone; if you take an Action that ends the spell, it ends only for you, not for the caster.": "当另一个生物施展时间停止时，作为反应，你可以花费5个时空点来获得在法术持续时间内行动的能力。你和施法者轮流行动，由施法者先行动。你的限制与施法者相同。如果施法者结束咒语，它对所有人都会结束；如果你采取行动结束咒语，它只对你结束，而不是对施法者。",
	"Given the Nature of Void Magic, it comes as no Surprise that a specialty of arcane Spellcasting sprang up from the study of Void Speech.": "鉴于虚空魔法的性质，从虚空之语的研究中涌现出一种专业的奥秘法术，这并不奇怪。",
	"Void casters are a standoffish and secretive lot, prone to delving into monster-prowled ruins and the dark corners of moldering libraries with equal caution; carelessly reading a text that might be sprinkled with Void glyphs can be just as deadly as stumbling into a den of Trolls. As Void casters continue to study Void Speech, they learn to properly invoke the words and glyphs to empower a Special type of magic that taps the vast potential of the Void.": "虚空施法者是一个冷漠而神秘的群体，他们容易深入到怪物出没的废墟和发霉的图书馆的阴暗角落，同样小心翼翼；不小心读到可能撒有虚空石刻的文字，就像跌入巨魔的洞穴一样致命。随着虚空施法者继续研究虚空之语，他们学会了正确地调用文字和石刻来赋予一种特殊类型的魔法，挖掘虚空的巨大潜力。",
	"Some Void casters risk the Darkness for the sake of gaining knowledge or strengthening one's defenses against that which lies beyond. Others succumb to the Madness and corruption that Void Magic causes and become living conduits for the horrors seeking entry into the world.": "一些虚空施法者为了获得知识或加强自己对外界的防御而冒险进入黑暗。其他人则屈服于虚空魔法造成的疯狂和腐败，成为寻求进入世界的恐怖的活通道。",
	"A Void caster can accumulate twice the normal amount of Void Taint before being affected by exposure to the Void—and has advantage on Saving Throws made to resist gaining Void Taint.": "虚空施法者在受到虚空影响之前，可以积累两倍的虚空污点，并且在抵抗获得虚空污点的蓄力投掷中具有优势。",
	"Starting at 2nd Level, as a bonus Action immediately before Casting a Spell of 1st Level or higher, a Void caster can utter a few words of Void Speech and weave its Dark Magic into the spell. The tainted spell disorients one creature the caster can see that the spell affects when it is cast. The creature has disadvantage on the next Attack roll or ability check it makes before the start of the Void caster's next turn. The caster must be able to speak in order to use this feature.": "从2级开始，作为施放1级或以上的法术前的额外行动，虚空施法者可以说出几句虚空之语，并将其黑暗魔法编织到法术中。被玷污的咒语会使施法者在施法时看到的一个受影响的生物感到厌恶。该生物在虚空施法者下一回合开始前进行的下一次攻击卷或能力检查中处于劣势。施法者必须能够说话才能使用此功能。",
	"Beginning at 6th Level, when damaged by a creature within 60 feet, a Void caster can use a Reaction to bark a destructive word of Void Speech. If the creature can hear the caster, it takes necrotic damage equal to half the caster's Wizard level + his or her Intelligence modifier. A caster can use this ability a number of times equal to his or her Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), and regains all expended uses after finishing a Long Rest. The caster can't use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.": "从6级开始，当被60英尺内的生物伤害时，虚空施法者可以使用反应来叫出一个虚空言语的破坏性话语。如果该生物能听到施法者的声音，它将受到相当于施法者巫师等级的一半+他或她的智力修正值的坏死伤害。施法者可以使用这个能力的次数等于他或她的智力修饰值（最少一次），并且在完成一次长时间休息后恢复所有消耗的使用。如果施法者不能说话，他或她就不能使用这个功能。",

	"At 14th level, a Void caster can choose a point he or she can see within 60 feet and use an Action to utter a complicated phrase in Void Speech. The area within 20 feet of the point is shrouded in dim light for 1 minute. Any creature in the area that is Hostile to the caster gains vulnerability to necrotic damage and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks. An affected creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 3d6 necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful Constitution saving throw (using the Void caster's spell save DC). Once a caster uses this ability, it can't be used again until after finishing a short or Long Rest. The caster can't use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.": "在14级时，虚空施法者可以在60英尺范围内选择一个他或她能看到的点，并使用一个行动来说出一个复杂的虚空言语。该点20英尺范围内的区域将被笼罩在昏暗的光线中，持续1分钟。该区域内任何对施法者有敌意的生物都会获得对坏死性伤害的脆弱性，并在智慧检查中处于劣势。受影响的生物如果在该区域开始其回合，或者在其回合中第一次进入该区域，会受到3d6的坏死伤害，或者在成功进行宪法救赎的情况下受到一半的伤害（使用虚空施法者的法术救赎DC）。一旦施法者使用了这个能力，就不能再使用，直到完成短期或长期休息后。如果施法者不能说话，他或她就不能使用这个功能。",
	"An enlightened few wizards know that true mastery of life and death requires understanding of the uneasy balance between life, death, and undeath—the necromantic triad.": "少数开明的巫师知道，真正掌握生与死需要了解生命、死亡和不死之间的不稳定平衡--死灵学三要素。",

	"Also starting at 2nd Level, you can use an Action to heal a creature you can touch. The creature regains Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Wizard level (minimum of 1).

	"At 6th Level, you add the Animate Dead spell to your Spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast this spell, it has additional effects:": "在第6级时，如果你的法术书中没有 \"活死人 \"这个法术，你可以将它添加到法术书中。当你施展这个法术时，它有额外的效果。",

On a successful check, the creature remains under your control, and the DC of the next check you make to maintain control 24 hours later increases by 1.
