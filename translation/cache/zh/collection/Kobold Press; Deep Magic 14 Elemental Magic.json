The wind blows from you toward the end of the line, which is stationary once created. A creature in the line moving with the wind adds 10 feet to its speed, and ranged weapon attacks fired with the wind don't suffer disadvantage due to long range. Creatures in the line moving against the wind spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they move, and ranged weapon attacks fired through the line against the wind are made with disadvantage.": "你创造了一个漩涡状的强风隧道，从你自己向你选择的方向延伸。该隧道是一条60英尺长、10英尺宽的线。风从你身上吹向线的末端，一旦形成就会静止不动。线上的生物随风而动，其速度增加10英尺，随风发射的远程武器攻击不会因为距离过长而处于劣势。线条中的生物逆风而行，每移动1英尺就会消耗2英尺的移动距离，通过线条逆风而行的远程武器攻击会产生劣势。",

Elementalists are often secluded researchers, or they sign on with groups who appreciate their singular talents.": "你把你的奥术研究集中在元素界的内在力量上。有时会被误认为是唤醒者，元素师相信他们所选择的元素的优越性高于其他所有元素，而且他们并不羞于将这个事实公之于众。元素学家通常是隐居的研究者，或者他们与那些欣赏他们独特才能的团体签约。",

	"Some spells resonate with your focus element. They might deal the associated damage type, manipulate the element in question, or otherwise embody an elemental theme. Work with your GM to determine whether a given spell resonates with your focus. The gold and time you must spend to copy a spell resonant with your chosen element into your spellbook is halved. When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn for gaining a level can be an elemental magic spell even if you've never encountered the spell before. Similarly, when you learn a new cantrip, it can be an elemental magic cantrip even if you've never encountered it.": "有些法术与你的重点元素产生共鸣。它们可能会造成相关的伤害类型，操纵相关的元素，或以其他方式体现一个元素主题。与你的GM一起确定一个给定的法术是否与你的焦点产生共鸣。你必须花费一半的金币和时间将一个与你选择的元素产生共鸣的咒语复制到你的法术书中。当你获得一个等级时，你为获得一个等级而学习的两个法术中的一个可以是元素魔法的法术，即使你以前从未遇到过这种法术。同样地，当你学习一个新的咒语时，它可以是一个元素魔法咒语，即使你从来没有遇到过它。",

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你可以在你拥有的任何抵抗或豁免权适用之前使用这个能力。你可以使用这个能力的次数等于你的智力修饰值（最小为1），并且当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用次数。",
