This kinship could have either allowed you to form an innate connection to the void, thus drawing power from it, or you decided to study and research it, thus coming across obscure knowledge that opened new vistas of reality to you—and new capabilities.": "一些有生命的生物对宇宙的基本方法更加敏感，发现不存在的概念和存在一样美丽。根据定义的必然性，它总是在那里，当你在一个原本星光灿烂的夜晚抬头看一片空旷的地方时，你感到与它有一种亲缘关系。这种亲缘关系可能使你与虚空形成一种天生的联系，从而从它那里汲取力量，或者你决定学习和研究它，从而接触到晦涩难懂的知识，为你打开了现实的新视野--新能力。",
	"On the other hand, if you'd like your patron to be a conscious creature rather than a force of nature, your patron could be an individual—such as Navilid—that has uncovered great knowledge about the void, has put that knowledge into practice. They have come to be in tune enough with the void that they can bestow that power into others as well, and have selected you as their protege—or perhaps just another minion. What will you think of their agenda and their plans? Do they line up with how you see the world, and the force behind both your powers? Will you follow their cause, or create your own path?": "另一方面，如果你希望你的守护者是一个有意识的生物，而不是自然界的力量，你的守护者可以是一个人，比如纳维利德，他发现了关于虚空的伟大知识，并将这些知识付诸实践。他们已经与虚空有了足够的默契，以至于他们也能将这种力量赋予他人，并选择你作为他们的门徒，或者也许只是另一个奴才。你对他们的议程和计划有何看法？它们是否与你对世界的看法一致，以及你的力量背后的力量？你会跟随他们的事业，还是创造你自己的道路？",
	"The {@creature nullifier|IGtN} is a new choice of familiar for warlocks of the Void with the Pact of the Chain feature. The nullifier is a small elemental made of null energy that a warlock attuned with the Void can bring into existence.": "虚空者（%0%）是虚空术士的一个新的熟悉选择，具有链之契约的特性。虚空者是一个由虚空能量构成的小型元素，与虚空相适应的术士可以将其带入现实。",
	"The Void lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.": "虚空让你在学习术士法术时从扩大的法术列表中进行选择。以下的法术会被添加到术士法术列表中为你所用。",
	"{@spell summon elemental|TCE} (void only*), {@spell wall of void|IGtN}": "{@spell summon elemental|TCE}(仅适用于空白*), {@spell wall of void|IGtN}",
	"Starting at 1st level, you have started merging your existence with the concept of nothing. You cannot be detected by divination magic, and are immune to effects that sense your emotions or read your thoughts. It's as if you're not even there.": "从第一层开始，你已经开始将你的存在与无的概念融合在一起。你无法被占卜魔法探测到，并且对感知你的情绪或读取你的想法的效果免疫。就好像你根本不存在一样。",
	"This partial detachment also makes you harder to read. Creatures have a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Insight) score when trying to gauge you. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on an Wisdom (Insight) check regarding you, they start having doubts about whether you are even there, or if you are some kind of illusion or projection of their mind.": "这种部分分离也使你更难被读懂。生物在试图判断你时，他们的被动智慧（洞察力）得分会受到-5的惩罚。如果一个生物在关于你的智慧（洞察力）检查中得到一个自然的1分，他们就会开始怀疑你是否真的存在，或者你是否是某种幻觉或他们思想的投影。",
	"Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hitpoints, this nothingness inside you expands to strike every creature within 5 feet of you. They take damage equal to your warlock level + your charisma modifier. You can use this ability once per short or long rest.": "此外，当你的命中率降至0时，你体内的虚无会扩大，攻击你周围5英尺内的每一个生物。他们受到的伤害等于你的术士等级+你的魅力修改器。你可以在每个短时或长时休息中使用这个能力一次。",
	"Starting at 6th level, space is nothing but an illusion. You can use your bonus action to teleport to a point you can see within 120 feet of you. You must then complete a short or long rest before you can use this ability again. Additionally, you can't be banished from the plane you are on or teleported in any way against your will.": "从6级开始，空间只不过是一种幻觉。你可以使用你的额外行动来传送到你能看到的120英尺内的一个点。然后你必须完成一个短暂或长时间的休息，才能再次使用这个能力。此外，你不能被驱逐出你所在的平面，也不能以任何方式违背你的意愿进行传送。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you can transform into your natural state in order to avoid harm. When you are hit with an attack from an attacker you can see, you can use your reaction to disperse your body into nothingness and negate the damage. You disappear, without having any awareness of what is transpiring while you are gone. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn, at which point you return to the space you occupied.": "从10级开始，你可以转化为你的自然状态，以避免伤害。当你被你能看到的攻击者击中时，你可以用你的反应将你的身体分散成虚无，并抵消伤害。你会消失，对你离开时发生的事情没有任何意识。这个效果一直持续到你下一个回合的开始，这时你会回到你占据的空间。",
	"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期的休息。",
	"Starting at 14th level, even long distances are nothing but a step away when you realize the emptiness that suffuses the universe... So easily traversable. As an action, you can cast {@spell teleport} without expending a spell slot. Once you've used this ability, you have to complete a short or long rest before being able to do so again.": "从第14层开始，当你意识到弥漫在宇宙中的空虚时，即使是遥远的距离也不过是一步之遥......。如此容易穿越。作为一个动作，你可以在不消耗法术槽的情况下施放（%0%）。一旦你使用了这种能力，你必须在完成一次短暂或长时间的休息后才能再次使用。",
	"Each time a creature travels in this way small parts of it, little by little, are lost in the void realm, as it receives a point of null corruption. Whenever a creature does so, its current and maximum hitpoints are reduced by an amount equal to the total corruption points it has. This reduction cannot be cured by any effect other than a wish spell. If a creature's current or maximum hitpoints are reduced to 0 in this way, its body dematerializes into nothing during the teleportation, becoming one with the void realm.": "每当一个生物以这种方式旅行时，它的小部分就会一点一点地消失在虚空领域中，因为它得到了一点无效的腐败。每当一个生物这样做时，它的当前和最大命中率都会减少，减少的量等于它所拥有的腐败点总数。除了愿望法术之外，这种减少不能被任何效果所治愈。如果一个生物的当前或最大命中率以这种方式降低到0，它的身体会在传送过程中化为乌有，与虚空领域融为一体。",
	"You can spend 1 hour in meditation with an object no larger than 5 feet in any dimension to bestow some of your patron's nature to it. Once you're bonded to it, you can use an action to make the object disappear into nothingness no matter how far away from you it is. You can then at any point use an action to make it materialize on your person, or within 5 feet of you. If that object is armor, you can equip it in this way, or equip it to another willing creature within 5 feet of you.": "你可以花1小时与一个在任何维度上不超过5英尺的物体进行冥想，将你的守护者的一些本性赋予它。一旦你与它结合，你可以使用一个动作使该物体消失在虚无之中，无论它离你有多远。然后你可以在任何时候使用一个动作使它在你身上或在你的5英尺范围内出现。如果该物体是盔甲，你可以用这种方式装备它，或者将它装备给你周围5英尺内另一个愿意的生物。",
	"You can be bonded to a number of objects in this way equal to half your proficiency modifier (rounded up).": "你可以通过这种方式与一定数量的物体结合，其数量等于你的熟练度修改值的一半（四舍五入）。",
	"When you cast a warlock spell, you can choose to cast it without requiring any components. Once you've used this ability, you need to complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.": "当你施展术士法术时，你可以选择在不需要任何组件的情况下施展它。一旦你使用了这种能力，你需要完成一次短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",

	"You have learned to discorporate your body while still maintaining control over your mind. After a time of 1 minute spent in focus or meditation, your body phases out, disappearing from the material realm. You can remain nonexistent for up to 1 hour, at which point you return to the space you last occupied. Once you've used this ability, you need to complete a short or long rest before being able to use it again.": "你已经学会了在保持对心智的控制的同时抛弃你的身体。在专注或冥想1分钟后，你的身体会逐渐消失，从物质世界中消失。你可以保持不存在长达1小时，这时你会回到你最后占据的空间。一旦你使用了这种能力，你需要完成一个短期或长期的休息，然后才能再次使用它。",
	"Alternatively, while meditating you can focus on a location that you have visited before, and as your body discorporates, your mind is transported there. For 10 minutes, you can navigate towards any direction you like, but you can only observe what is happening around you in this form, without being able to interact with it in any way. You can only be perceived by a creature that has truesight, which would see a ghostly featureless body floating in the air. At the end of the duration, you return to the space you last occupied before discorporating.": "或者，在冥想时，你可以把注意力集中在一个你曾经去过的地方，当你的身体消失时，你的思想就被传送到那里。在10分钟内，你可以朝你喜欢的任何方向航行，但你只能以这种形式观察你周围发生的事情，而不能以任何方式与它互动。你只能被拥有真实视力的生物所感知，它将看到一个漂浮在空中的没有特征的幽灵般的身体。在持续时间结束时，你会回到你在化身之前最后占据的空间。",
	"You can cast {@spell dispel magic} once at the highest level available to you without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.": "你可以在你可用的最高等级下施放（%0%）一次，而不需要消耗一个法术槽。当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得这样的能力。",
	"Additionally, you can select one of the following benefits when you learn this invocation. You can only use these benefits when you cast the spell using this invocation:": "此外，当你学习这个召唤时，你可以选择以下一种好处。你只能在使用此咒语施法时使用这些好处。",
	"You can use a bonus action to cast the spell if you are targeting yourself with it.": "如果你以自己为目标，你可以使用一个额外的行动来施展该法术。",
	"If you make a spellcasting ability check to determine the outcome of the spell's casting, you can do so with advantage.": "如果你进行法术能力检查以确定该法术的施放结果，你可以以优势的方式进行。",

	"Your soul has overcome the need for matter. When you die, your body dematerializes back into nothing. When a creature casts a spell that requires your body to resurrect you, it can cast the spell even if your body is missing.": "你的灵魂已经克服了对物质的需求。当你死亡时，你的身体就会非物质化，重新变成虚无。当一个生物施展需要你的身体来复活你的法术时，即使你的身体不见了，它也可以施展这个法术。",
	"When a creature deals damage to a target you can see within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to turn that damage into nulling damage. Once you've used this ability, you need to complete a short or long rest before using it again.": "当一个生物对你周围60英尺内你能看到的目标造成伤害时，你可以用你的反应将该伤害变成无效伤害。一旦你使用了这个能力，你需要完成一个短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",
	"You can cast {@spell blink} once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell in this way instead of rolling a d20, you can decide at will whether you vanish from your current plane of existence or not at the end of your turn.": "你可以在不消耗法术槽的情况下施放一次（%0%）。当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得这样的能力。当你以这种方式施法而不是掷骰子时，你可以随意决定在你的回合结束时你是否从你当前的存在平面上消失。",
	"You can cast {@spell scatter|XGE} once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.": "你可以在不消耗法术槽的情况下施放一次（%0%）。当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会重新获得这样的能力。",

	"Nullborn have an entirely random existence, and their life spans vary wildly from individual to individual. They mature at the same rate as the heritage they were born in, but some nullborn may live for centuries, while others might reach their natural end only a few years after arriving into the world. {@dice 1d6+6} days after a nullborn dies, its remains begin to phase out of existence, until they return to nothingness.": "无名氏的存在是完全随机的，他们的寿命因人而异，变化很大。他们的成熟速度与他们出生时的遗产相同，但有些新生儿可能会活上几个世纪，而另一些新生儿可能在来到这个世界几年后才达到自然的终点。(空生儿死亡后的几天，其遗体开始逐渐消失，直到回归虚无。",
	"Nullborn are infused with the temperant nothingness that surrounds all being. Thus, they tend to be stoic and lean towards neutral alignments. Some nullborn however, rather than experiencing peace and timelessness at the though of nothingness, might feel a maniacal pleasure at the thought of its approach, and might seek to hasten it. Good nullborn tend to be dispassionate given they fact they don't understand corporeal matters, and may look at the big picture, rather than what is happening right now.": "无生者被围绕着所有存在的气质虚无所浸润。因此，他们倾向于坚忍不拔，并倾向于中立的取向。然而，有些新生儿并没有因为虚无而体验到平静和永恒，而是一想到它的到来就会感到狂喜，并可能试图加速它。好的无生者倾向于冷静，因为他们不了解肉体的事情，可能会着眼于大局，而不是现在正在发生的事情。",
	"You don't need to eat, sleep, drink or breathe. When taking a long rest, you need to spend 4 hours to focus on your existence by meditating in order to ground yourself into reality.": "你不需要吃、睡、喝或呼吸。在长期休息时，你需要花4个小时通过冥想来专注于自己的存在，以使自己立足于现实。",
	"Once per long rest, you can use an action to shed your physical existence, becoming a cloud of gas and light for 10 minutes. Looking much like a nebula, you can momentarily pass through other creatures and objects in your amorphous form, but you can't end your turn inside an object or creature. If you do, you are shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space. While in this state, you can't attack, speak or cast spells. You can use an action to end this effect early. After you reach 10th level, you can stay in this state for up to 1 hour.": "每长时休息一次，你可以使用一个动作来摆脱你的身体存在，变成一团气体和光，持续10分钟。你看起来很像一个星云，你可以在你的无定形中瞬间穿过其他生物和物体，但你不能在一个物体或生物中结束你的回合。如果你这样做了，你会被分流到最近的无人空间。在这种状态下，你不能攻击、说话或施法。你可以使用一个动作来提前结束这个效果。在你达到10级之后，你可以在这种状态下停留长达1小时。",
	"When you complete a long rest, you gain resistance to one random element. Roll 1d8. Your focus anchored you in reality so that it partially phases through you.": "当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会获得对一个随机元素的抵抗。滚动1d8。你的注意力将你锚定在现实中，所以它部分地通过你来进行。",
	"You warp the energy balance of space in a 30 ft. radius sphere centered on a point within range. For the duration, when the area of another spell or magical effect of your choice, such as fireball, extends into the sphere, it deals half as much damage to targets within the energy dissipator sphere. This spell only interacts with effects that deal damage by targeting an area of effect, rather than targeting a creature directly.": "你扭曲了空间的能量平衡，以范围内的一个点为中心，形成一个半径30英尺的球体。在持续时间内，当你选择的另一个法术或魔法效果（如火球）的区域延伸到该球体时，它对能量消散球体内的目标造成一半的伤害。这个法术只与以效果区域为目标造成伤害的效果互动，而不是直接以生物为目标。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, its casting does not require concentration.": "当你使用六级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，其施放不需要集中注意力。",
	"You channel the energy of the void as harmful energy strikes you, instantly nullifying it. You reduce the damage you take from the triggering effect to 0, by shunting the harmful energy to a parallel void realm. If the spell ends before its full duration elapses, the energy returns, striking you as it would normally have, and you take as much damage as you would have taken from this spell's triggering effect. If you concentrate on this spell for its full duration, the energy is siphoned off into nothing.": "当有害的能量袭击你时，你引导虚空的能量，瞬间使其失效。你通过将有害能量分流到一个平行的虚空领域，将你从触发效果中受到的伤害减少到0。如果咒语在其全部持续时间结束之前就结束了，那么能量就会回来，像平时一样攻击你，而你受到的伤害与你从这个咒语的触发效果中受到的伤害一样多。如果你专注于这个咒语的全部持续时间，能量会被抽走，化为乌有。",
	"You erase the existence of a creature you can see within range. The creature is instantly shunted out of the material realm, ceasing to exist for the duration of the spell. If you concentrate on this spell for its full duration, the target does not return and its existence is erased from the past, present and future. No one apart from you can remember its existence.": "你抹去范围内你能看到的一个生物的存在。该生物立即被分流出物质界，在咒语持续期间不再存在。如果你专注于这个法术的全部持续时间，目标就不会再回来，它的存在也会从过去、现在和未来被抹去。除了你之外，没有人能够记住它的存在。",
	"It is up to the discretion of the DM how its erasure will affect the timeline, as the act can have unpredictable consequences. For example, if you try to erase from existence a cruel warlord in order to prevent his crimes, a crueler one might take his place. Additionally, the DM could rule that this act creates an alternate timeline, and only creatures in that other timeline live in the universe where that creature did not exist.": "抹去后会对时间线产生怎样的影响，这取决于DM的自由裁量权，因为这种行为可能会产生不可预知的后果。例如，如果你试图从一个残酷的军阀身上抹去，以防止他犯罪，那么一个更残酷的军阀可能会取代他的位置。此外，DM可以规定这种行为创造了一条替代的时间线，而只有那条替代的时间线中的生物才能生活在那个生物不存在的宇宙中。",
	"The next time you hit with a weapon attack, you imbue it with the power of the void. The target takes an extra {@damage 1d6} nulling damage, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or be unable to cast spells until the end of its next turn.": "下次你用武器攻击时，你会将虚空的力量灌输给它。目标会受到额外的{@damage 1d6}无效伤害，并且必须在智慧救赎中成功，否则在下一回合结束前无法施展法术。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by {@dice 1d6} for each slot level above 2nd.": "当你使用3级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，法术槽等级每超过2级，额外的伤害就会增加（%0%）。",
	"You bend spacetime to form a wall of void on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.": "你弯曲时空，在范围内的固体表面形成一堵空墙。你可以使墙长达60英尺，高20英尺，厚1英尺，或者使环形墙的直径达20英尺，高20英尺，厚1英尺。墙是不透明的，并且持续时间较长。",
	"When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 5d8} nulling damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there": "当墙出现时，其范围内的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的救赎动作。拯救失败时，生物会受到{@damage 5d8}的无效伤害，拯救成功时则受到一半的伤害。当生物在一个回合中第一次进入墙内或在那里结束其回合时，会受到同样的伤害。",
	"When a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the wall, its density forms a gravity well that threatens to swallow them. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be pulled 10 feet towards the wall until they enter it.": "当一个生物在墙的10英尺范围内开始它的回合时，它的密度会形成一个重力井，威胁到吞噬它们。该生物必须成功地进行力量救赎，或者被拉向墙壁10英尺，直到他们进入墙壁。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@dice 1d8} for each slot level above 4th.": "当你使用五级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，每超过四级的法术槽等级，伤害会增加（%0%）。"
