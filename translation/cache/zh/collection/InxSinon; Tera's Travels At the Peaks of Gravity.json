	"The Peaks of Gravity mountain range juts out of the earth as if created by no physical phenomenon. The mountaintops are sharp peaks that can be seen for miles, yet intense gravitational energy prevents all but a few from scaling them. Some believe that centuries ago powerful gravitational waves passed through the area and altered its natural behavior, creating the mountain range and leaving long lasting magical energy. Others more closely connected to the earth say it is much more natural, and simply the forces of nature manifesting themselves.": "重力之峰 \"山脉从地球上伸出来，仿佛不是由物理现象造成的。山顶是尖锐的山峰，可以看到数英里之外，然而强烈的引力能量使除了少数人之外的所有人都无法攀登。一些人认为，几个世纪前，强大的引力波穿过这个地区，改变了它的自然行为，创造了这个山脉，并留下了长久的神奇能量。其他与地球关系更密切的人说，这是更自然的，只是自然界的力量表现出来。",

	"Throughout the path, there can often be points of interest on the side of the bordering mountains, such as a bird's nest or discarded grappling hook stuck in rock. A creature attempting to climb the side of the a mountain here must succeed on a DC 15 {@skill Athletics} check at the start of each of its turns, or be unable to climb until the start of its next turn.

	"Most signs or postings don't last here due to the harsh conditions, but there is one large bronze statue of a humanoid pointing upwards and to the north at the half way point between the west and east side of the mountain range. About 100 feet off the path there is a steep cliffside hill with noticeable footholds that follows the direction the statue is pointing. This is the beginning of the path to Rigi, and the beginning of the real dangers faced along the way.": "由于条件恶劣，大多数标志或张贴物在这里并不持久，但在山脉西侧和东侧的半山腰处，有一个大型的人形铜像指向上方和北方。在离小路大约100英尺的地方，有一个陡峭的崖边小山，有明显的立足点，沿着雕像所指的方向。这是通往Rigi的道路的开始，也是沿途面临的真正危险的开始。",
	"The hillside is 80 feet high, at almost a 90 degree angle, and only climbable to a width of 40 feet. A creature climbing the path must make a DC 15 {@skill Athletics} check each turn it attempts to climb higher. On a success, it moves at its climb speed for the turn. On a failure, a creature moves at only half its possible climb speed for the turn. If the creature fails by 5 or more, it loses all its movement for the turn and falls up to 10 feet down.": "山坡有80英尺高，几乎呈90度角，只能爬到40英尺宽。攀爬路径的生物必须在每一回合进行DC 15 {@skill Athletics}的检查，以试图爬高。如果成功，它就会在该回合内以其攀爬速度移动。如果失败，生物在这一回合只能以其可能的攀爬速度的一半移动。如果该生物失败了5次或更多，它就会失去该回合的所有移动，并跌落到10英尺以下。",

	"It is not uncommon for {@creature goblin|mm|goblins} or {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} to set ambushes at the top of the hill.

	"According to locals living in Rigi, everything between the first hill to Rigi and the town itself is know as the wide range. It is almost exclusively traversed by monsters, {@creature bandit|mm|bandits}, confident travelers, and adventurers. On occasion there are those studying or otherwise connecting to the gravitational energy that can be found living or passing through the wide range.": "据住在Rigi的当地人说，在通往Rigi的第一座山和小镇本身之间的一切都被称为宽广的范围。几乎只有怪物、（%0%）、自信的旅行者和冒险家才会穿越它。偶尔也有研究或以其他方式与引力能量相联系的人，他们可以发现生活在或经过宽广的范围内。",
	"The wide range encompasses dozens of mountains with summits ranging from just over 9,000 feet to well over 20,000. The highest peak, and location of Rigi, stands 24,042 feet above the ground. There is not one clear safest path to Rigi, and getting there relies on survival and always pressing towards the highest points. A party traveling at a normal pace can expect to spend several days traveling the mountains before reaching Rigi.": "这片广阔的山脉包括几十座山峰，山顶高度从刚过9000英尺到远远超过2万英尺不等。最高峰，也是Rigi的所在地，离地面有24042英尺。没有一条明确的最安全的路径通往Rigi，到达那里要依靠生存，并始终向最高点推进。一支以正常速度旅行的队伍在到达Rigi之前，可能要花几天时间在山上旅行。",
	"Several large mountains meet to form what looks like a valley of dirt and sand surrounded by rocky mountain peaks only 20- 60 feet above. This is a known spot for intelligent creatures, such as {@creature adult gravity dragon|TTAtPoG|gravity dragons}, to lurk and attack resting travelers.": "几座大山交汇在一起，形成一个看起来像泥土和沙子的山谷，周围是岩石山峰，海拔只有20-60英尺。这是一个已知的智能生物的地方，比如（%0%），潜伏并攻击休息的旅行者。",
	"One mountain within the wide range stands out with a completely flat rocky summit. The mountain is filled with a maze of tunnels mined out by adventures seeking to create a safe home within the peaks. Over time the tunnels were taken over by {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} and those with ill intentions looking for hiding.": "在广阔的山脉中，有一座山峰以完全平坦的岩石山顶而引人注目。这座山充满了迷宫般的隧道，这些隧道是由寻求在山峰中建立安全家园的冒险家开采出来的。随着时间的推移，这些隧道被{@creature bandit|mm|bandits}和那些心怀叵测的人占领，寻找藏身之处。",
	"The tunnels slowly path upwards, but are now littered with traps and dead ends that can lock you in behind bars. The {@creature bandit|mm|bandits} here are quick to make a deal to let prisoners go in exchange for items and gold. They don't rush to attack unless provoked. Though they do have at least one mage who specializes in gravitational magic and will not hesitate to use it against a threat.": "隧道慢慢往上走，但现在到处都是陷阱和死胡同，可以把你关在铁窗里。这里的（%0%）人很快就会达成交易，放走囚犯以换取物品和黄金。除非受到挑衅，否则他们不会急于攻击。虽然他们至少有一个法师专门研究引力魔法，并且会毫不犹豫地使用它来对付威胁。",
	"If one manages to fight, sneak, or persuade their way through the tunnels, they eventually lead out to the top of the rocky mountain. This flat summit serves as a great lookout across the wind range, and a great jumping off point for anyone with access to a {@spell fly} or similar spell.": "如果人们设法通过战斗、潜行或劝说的方式穿过隧道，它们最终会通向岩石山的顶部。这个平坦的山顶是一个很好的风向标，也是任何能够使用（%0%）或类似法术的人的一个很好的跳板。",
	"Rigi is a modestly sized village at the highest peak within the Peaks of Gravity. It is home to many different peoples and races that have found themselves there. Because of its secluded location, Rigi has its own cultural society and means of thriving. Yet they still use gold for trading as travelers often pass through.": "里吉是一个规模不大的村庄，位于重力之峰的最高峰。它是许多不同民族和种族的家园，他们在这里找到了自己。由于其隐蔽的位置，Rigi有自己的文化社会和繁荣的手段。然而，他们仍然使用黄金进行交易，因为旅行者经常经过这里。",
	"All the buildings here are flat one story structures, as the immense gravity would topple tall structures without extreme fortification. The earth is also flat covered in sandy dirt throughout the village with heavy cobblestone pressed in creating simple walkways. There are very few carts and no beasts of burden regularly used. If such a creature is brought here by magical means, it is a sight that is taken notice of.": "这里所有的建筑都是平坦的单层结构，因为巨大的重力会使高大的建筑在没有极端的防御措施的情况下倒塌。整个村庄的土地也是平坦的，覆盖着沙土，厚重的鹅卵石被压在上面，形成简单的步行通道。这里很少有马车，也没有经常使用的野兽。如果这种生物是通过魔法手段带到这里的，那就会引起人们的注意。",
	"There are set locations of vegetation within Rigi that are fueled by a crystal of {@spell plant growth}. The crystal is located in the the main government building of Rigi and is a sacred object to the people of the village. It is only brought out once a year at the harvest festival to initiate the plant growth for the next year. Such magical means are necessary to grow enough food for the entire city.": "在Rigi，有一些固定的植被位置，由{@spell plant growth}的水晶提供燃料。这块水晶位于Rigi的主要政府大楼里，对村里的人来说是个神圣的东西。它只在每年的收获节时被拿出来，以启动下一年的植物生长。这种神奇的手段是为整个城市种植足够的食物所必需的。",

	"Patrice's Potions is a small old wooden building that sits off the side of the open market. Its door and wooden floors creak when used. The owner, Patrice, is a bright blue and red Thrush woman that lives in a small room in the back filled with collected branches and trinkets making a large nest. Patrice crafts her own potions and sells them at a markup to the normal price, even to locals, and even more so to outsiders. Her supplies are limited, but she always has a few health potions unless adventurers have recently passed through.": "帕特里斯药房是一座小的旧木楼，坐落在公开市场的一侧。它的门和木地板在使用时发出吱吱声。店主帕特里斯是一个鲜艳的蓝红相间的女鲛人，她住在后面的一个小房间里，里面堆满了收集来的树枝和小饰品，构成了一个大窝。帕特丽斯自己制作药水，并在正常价格的基础上加价出售，即使对当地人也是如此，对外地人更是如此。她的供应是有限的，但她总是有一些健康药水，除非冒险者最近路过。",
	"Ol'Dinners is a local bar built of heavy stone and brick. On the inside it is painted with bright colors and is run by a middle aged human man that calls himself Ol'Dinger. He has a bell hanging behind the bar that he rings loudly whenever a drink is ordered. The more that is ordered, the more excited he gets, and the louder he rings the bell. He calls the local drink a dinger that he tries to sell to all customers if they haven't tried it.": "奥尔丁格是当地一家用厚重的石头和砖块建成的酒吧。里面涂着鲜艳的颜色，由一个自称为欧丁格的中年男子经营。他有一个挂在吧台后面的铃铛，每当有人点酒，他就会大声地摇铃。点的酒越多，他就越兴奋，铃声就越大。他把当地的饮料称为丁格，如果顾客没有尝试过，他就会试图把这种饮料卖给他们。",

Most everything is mundane and overpriced, but on rare occasion there are common magical items mixed with the trinkets.": "饰品和旅行是一个小的街头摊贩，出售随机的饰品和交易或旅行中发现的物品。大多数东西都是世俗的，而且价格过高，但偶尔也会有一些普通的魔法物品混在饰品中。",
