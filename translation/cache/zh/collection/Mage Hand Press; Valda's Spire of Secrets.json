	"As constructs, geppettin do not age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient.": "作为建构体，Geppettin不会衰老，一旦成为有意识的人，就会变得成熟。",
	"Geppettin, as varied as they are, run the gamut of alignments. Raggedies are generally good, bisques tend towards evil, and marionettes are usually in between": "Geppettin，就像他们一样变化多端，有各种不同的取向。褴褛的人一般是好的，假人倾向于邪恶，而牵线木偶通常介于两者之间。",
	"Geppettin have superior vision in dim light and darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "Geppettin在昏暗的光线和黑暗中拥有卓越的视觉。你可以在昏暗的光线下看到你周围60英尺内的东西，就像亮光一样，而黑暗中的东西就像昏暗的光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.": "即使你是被建造的，你也是一个活生生的生物。你对非魔法疾病有免疫力。你不需要吃或呼吸，但如果你愿意，你可以摄取食物和饮料。",
	"Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. You can still be placed into a torpor by sleepinducing magic.": "你不是在睡觉，而是每天进入4小时的不活动状态。在这种状态下，你不会做梦；你完全意识到你的周围环境，并像平常一样注意到接近的敌人和其他事件。你仍然可以通过诱导睡眠的魔法进入昏睡状态。",
	"Geppettin are generally indistinguishable from non-living dolls of the same type. Because of that, they can be very stealthy when required. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks you make to appear as a mundane toy": "Geppettin通常与同类型的非活体娃娃没有区别。正因为如此，他们在需要时可以非常隐蔽。你在进行魅力（欺骗）检查时有优势，你可以作为一个普通的玩具出现。",
	"Geppettin can read and write Common as well as one other language based on their creator's race (your choice).": "Geppettin可以读写普通话，以及根据他们的创造者的种族（你的选择）的一种其他语言。",
	"\"As soon as he reached home, Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette.\"": "\"一到家，杰佩托就拿起他的工具，开始切割和塑造木头，做成一个木偶。\"",
	"Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren't manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.": "Geppettin是孩子们的欢乐，它就像木头、布或瓷器制成的活的玩物。虽然很容易被误认为是木偶，但geppettin并不是由一个看不见的木偶师操纵的；它们是有生命的，有知觉的，独立的。",
	"As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities with each other that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not just freak mishaps of magic. While it may be that there are dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, a significant number of them have come to life on their own.": "作为一个种族，Geppettin是一个奇特的存在。虽然稀少，但他们的数量足够多，而且彼此之间有足够多的相似之处，可以算作一个真正的人种，而不仅仅是魔法的畸形失误。虽然可能有专门的geppettin创造者，就像golems一样，但有相当数量的geppettin是靠自己的力量活过来的。",
	"Physically, geppettin are quite small, often slightly shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by the materials of which they are composed: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and raggedy are made of fabric.": "从身体上看，geppettin是相当小的，通常比半身人略短。他们的身体特征因类型不同而有很大差异，但他们几乎都是人形的。为了简单起见，geppettin按其组成材料进行分类： bisque是瓷器，木偶是木头，而褴褛的是织物。",
	"Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience seems to grant them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins.": "尽管它们是由一些脆弱的材料制成的，但有意识似乎赋予它们一种奇怪的坚韧。此外，由于他们的非生命性质，他们从不饥饿，很少疲倦，并且善于表现得无害。大多数人在娱乐界找到了某种形式的工作或职业，但也有少数人作为间谍和刺客获得了巨大的成功。",
	"Though they bring delight to children, geppettin instill a cold fear in many adults—the type of fear that accompanies the uncanny realization that something inanimate is, in fact, alive. A person's first reactions to a geppettin can be most telling, and usually fall into two camps: those that find the geppettin delightful, perhaps recalling cherished childhood memories; and those that are taken by an unnerving phobia, feeling a sudden chill upon seeing a doll move of its own impetus.": "虽然它们给孩子们带来了快乐，但在许多成年人中，geppettin却灌输了一种冷酷的恐惧--那种伴随着不可思议的意识的恐惧，即无生命的东西实际上是活的。一个人对geppettin的第一反应是最有说服力的，通常分为两个阵营：那些觉得geppettin很有趣的人，也许会回忆起珍贵的童年记忆；以及那些被一种令人不安的恐惧症所困扰的人，在看到玩偶在自己的推动下移动时感到突然的寒冷。",
	"Like other constructs, geppettin rarely name themselves. Typically, a construct has no conception that living creatures obsessively name everything, and have a name bestowed upon them—in this case, geppettin are normally named by children, or are given terms of endearment by adults.": "像其他构造体一样，geppettin很少给自己起名字。通常情况下，构造体不知道生物会痴迷地给所有东西起名字，并给它们起一个名字--在这种情况下，geppettin通常由孩子们命名，或者由成年人给予爱称。",
	"None can say where this tradition originated, but mouselings hold to it strongly. If one is seen without a hood, it is a sure sign of disgrace and exile, the most personal punishment a village of mouselings can inflict.": "没有人可以说这一传统起源于哪里，但捕鼠者强烈地坚持它。如果一个人被看到没有戴头罩，那肯定是耻辱和流放的标志，这是一个村子的鼠人所能施加的最个人的惩罚。",

	"Mandrakes are known to keep centuries-old concords known only to the oldest of creatures. Though they stay neutral in most matters, they tend to lean toward lawful alignments.": "众所周知，曼德拉克斯保持着只有最古老的生物才知道的几个世纪的协约。虽然他们在大多数问题上保持中立，但他们倾向于合法的取向。",

Additionally, you can breathe through your leaves and extremities, and can absorb water and nutrients through your feet.": "尽管你不完全是植物，但你仍然拥有许多与植物相同的特征。只要你每天在阳光直射下至少4小时，你就不需要进食。此外，你可以通过你的叶子和四肢进行呼吸，并可以通过你的脚吸收水和营养物质。",
	"Even if you aren't proficient in Stealth, you can add your proficiency bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks that you make to hide in natural environments, such as forests.": "即使你不精通隐身术，你也可以将你的熟练度加到你在自然环境中隐藏的灵巧（隐身）检查上，例如森林。",
	"You know the {@spell shillelagh} cantrip and can target yourself with the spell, treating one of your limbs as a club instead of an unarmed strike. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell goodberry} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the barkskin spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "你知道{@spell shillelagh}的咒语，并能以自己为目标施法，把你的一个肢体当作棍棒而不是徒手攻击。当你达到3级时，你可以用这个特性施放一次（%1%）的咒语，并在你完成长时间休息时重新获得施放能力。当你达到5级时，你可以用这个特质施放一次巴克斯坦法术，并在完成长时间休息后重新获得施放能力。智慧是你对这些法术的施法能力。",

You can also communicate simple ideas to nonmagical plants and can question plants about events that occurred nearby during the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.": "你可以说、读、写普通话。你还可以与非魔法植物交流简单的想法，并可以向植物询问过去一天中在附近发生的事件，获得关于已经过去的生物、天气和其他情况的信息。",
	"\"It was an ancient thing of moss-covered wood which creaked like a greatoak as it breathed, but I'll never forget its eyes: those glowing points were a thing of the fey, a thing of the deep woods forgotten to man.\"": "\"它是一个古老的长满苔藓的木头，呼吸时像大橡树一样吱吱作响，但我永远不会忘记它的眼睛：那些发光的点是精灵的东西，是被人类遗忘的深林里的东西。\"",
	"Laymen believe that mandrakes are screaming, crying babies grown from the roots of a plant. However, small, wailing mandrakes are those which are harvested too early; literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, they emerge fully formed, able to mature into great and powerful tree people.": "外行人认为曼陀罗是由植物的根部生长出来的尖叫、哭泣的婴儿。然而，小而哭的曼陀罗是那些过早收获的植物；实际上是仍处于婴儿期的儿童。如果让它们在收获前生长一年零一天，它们就会完全成形，能够成熟为伟大而强大的树人。",
	"With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that while mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, they have become something midway between animal and plant through some strange magic or stranger evolution": "曼陀罗有着厚厚的树皮和生长在其四肢的叶子，你可以理解为曼陀罗只是奇怪的植物、树人或有生命的树木。这甚至可能是部分真实的：虽然曼陀罗起源于某种植物的祖先，但通过一些奇怪的魔法或奇怪的进化，它们已经成为介于动物和植物之间的东西。",
	"Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes. They bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone.": "曼德拉的解剖结构充满了悖论。它们流淌着红宝石般的汁液，让人联想到血液和树液。它们的心脏，看起来像一个根结，将其泵送到身体周围，用叶子和四肢上的特殊孔隙携带的氧气来充实它。根据偏好，曼陀罗可以沐浴在阳光下，或食用活物来获取营养，甚至可以通过它们的脚来吸收营养，不过它们很少只靠阳光和水来生存。",
	"Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates for her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids for aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors.": "炼金术士和奥术师都对曼陀罗搔首弄姿，但德鲁伊知道它们是站在动物和植物领域之间的绿色使者，为所有各方带来和平。在德鲁伊的传统中，曼陀罗是大自然母亲自己的独特、古老的构造，旨在作为她的意志的代表。曼陀罗被古老的德鲁伊认为是将精灵与森林和矮人与山峦结合在一起；只是随着人类的崛起和他们对神灵的偏爱，大多数生物才忘记了自然母亲和她的半植物大使。",
	"Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved.": "今天，曼陀罗已经很少见了，它们在村庄和城市与真正的荒野交汇处附近的森林里安家。人类传说曼陀罗会对进入其领地的人大打出手，但德鲁伊和那些尊重森林古老传统的人知道，这种愤怒很少是不应该的。",
	"Taking their names from the old spirits of the forest, which have long been forgotten by men, mandrakes treat all names with great reverence": "曼陀罗的名字来自森林中的古老精灵，这些精灵早已被人类遗忘，曼陀罗对所有的名字都非常敬重。",

	"Though the tiny, big-eared mousefolk are often overlooked by larger creatures, history is brimming with stories of gallant mouse-knights staring down dragons, crossing blades with warlords, and charging into grand battles. It happens that few histories are written about the valor of mousefolk—though many more should be—yet they make appearances in legend all the same, their bravery cementing their place in history.": "虽然小小的、大耳朵的鼠族经常被大型生物所忽视，但历史上却充满了英勇的鼠族骑士与龙搏斗、与军阀交锋、冲入大战役的故事。碰巧的是，很少有关于鼠族的英勇事迹被记载下来--尽管应该有更多的记载--但他们还是在传说中出现了，他们的勇敢巩固了他们在历史上的地位。",
	"Even excluding the long and proud history of mouse-knights, few mousefolk are apt to fear either big folk or monsters. Mousefolk are good to their neighbors and rarely pick fights; after all, most folk can be reasoned with. Those who can't be reasoned with, however, should rightly fear mousefolk striking at their knees. Mousefolk do not suffer bullies lightly.": "即使不考虑老鼠骑士的悠久而自豪的历史，也很少有老鼠族会害怕大人物或怪物。老鼠人对他们的邻居很好，很少挑起争端；毕竟，大多数人都可以被说服。然而，那些不能被说服的人，应该正确地害怕鼠人在他们的膝盖上动手。老鼠人不会轻易受欺负。",
	"The mousefolk language, Rodentia, has no written form. Thus, mousefolk preserve their history in story and in song passed from elders to children through the generations. Their oral tradition is rich, filled with stories of grand heroics, shrewd tricks, and swooning romance. Indeed, many mousefolk live to see themselves preserved in the legends of their people, their deeds remembered in a grand epic for the ages.": "鼠族的语言，Rodentia，没有书面形式。因此，鼠族用故事和歌声来保存他们的历史，这些故事和歌声由长者传给孩子，世代相传。他们的口述传统非常丰富，充满了伟大的英雄主义、精明的诡计和令人陶醉的浪漫故事。事实上，许多鼠族人活到现在，看到自己被保存在他们民族的传说中，他们的事迹被铭记在一部宏伟的史诗中，流传于世。",
	"Though ratlings have long abandoned the old ways, a mouseling is never to be seen without a hood.

What motivates you to keep fighting, even when you're at death's door?": "当创建一个监狱长时，考虑是什么驱动你的角色。是什么让你为他人举起你的盾牌？你是否为保护某个人或某个地方而战？对你的祖国或亲人的威胁可能是你的催化剂，但你也可能是为了打击对自然界的威胁而站起来。你的召唤是什么，你如何尊重它？是什么激励你继续战斗，即使你在死亡的边缘？",

This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.": "炼金炸弹是一个1磅重、苹果大小的球形玻璃或粘土烧瓶，里面装满了反应性化学品。一个装有试剂的较小的薄玻璃瓶悬浮在液体中，整个瓶子用软木塞或蜡封密封。化学品在混合后会发生剧烈爆炸。这发生在内瓶破裂时，通常是在炸弹撞击固体表面或导火线引爆小瓶内的小型炸药雷管之后。炸弹主要用于抵御敌人，但有创造力的炼金术士可能会为炸药找到更实用的用途，如拆除障碍物。",
	"More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions which replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as potions of healing, to the transformative, such as potions of gaseous form, to the downright deadly, such as potions of poison. Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right.": "更有经验的炼金术士学会将不太易挥发的物质混合成药水，即复制魔法效果的炼金术混合物。这些药水的范围很广，有药用的，如治疗药水；有转化的，如气态药水；也有直接致命的，如毒药药水。炼金术士是无可争议的药水大师，他们不断创新新的配方和制剂，将他们的药水改进为自己的魔法物品。",
	"The primary source of alchemy's power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher's stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher's stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets.": "炼金术力量的主要来源来自元素界。因此，炼金术士努力深入挖掘这种力量，研究和发现由元素组成的新化合物，这并不奇怪。炼金术的顶峰是哲学家之石，据传它能赋予持有者最高的元素力量。很少有炼金术士成功地创造出哲人石，更少有人能活着泄露它的秘密。",
	"When you create an alchemist, consider why your character studies alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power, or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability?": "当你创造一个炼金术士时，考虑你的角色为什么要研究炼金术。你是被其危险的力量所吸引，还是被其帮助他人的能力所吸引？你是否渴望使用魔法，但缺乏天赋或天生的能力？",
	"Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher's stone?": "你为什么要冒险？你在寻找新的炼金术配方或稀有成分吗？你是否像许多人一样，寻求哲学家的石头？",
	"Be sure to understand alchemy's place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity. Depending on the setting, you might be respected for your knowledge or feared for your destructive potential": "一定要了解炼金术在你的活动世界中的地位。你可能已经从一个大师那里学到了你的手艺，或者在大学里与工匠和巫师一起学习。你的手艺可能是普通的，也可能是奇特的。根据不同的背景，你可能因为你的知识而受到尊重，也可能因为你的破坏性潜力而受到畏惧。",
	"You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Choose any background.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快地做出一个炼金术士。首先，让智力成为你的最高能力得分，其次是灵巧。选择任何背景。",
	"An elf recites the motions again for the simplest spell she knows, repeating them until she knows they are perfect. With a single, precise stroke, she unleashes a wave of arcane energy, focused into a searing blue beam.": "一个精灵再次背诵了她所知道的最简单的咒语的动作，重复它们直到她知道它们是完美的。通过一个精确的动作，她释放了一波奥术能量，集中成一道灼热的蓝色光束。",
	"A tiefling waves her hands to conjure floating greatswords of humming blue energy, which dance about in mesmerizing and deadly arcs. One blade takes on an aspect of fire, and the other lightning, as she begins to cleave through the goblinoid horde.": "一个铁弗林挥舞着她的双手，变出了由嗡嗡作响的蓝色能量组成的浮动大剑，这些大剑以令人着迷和致命的弧线舞动。一把刀呈现出火的一面，另一把刀呈现出闪电的一面，她开始在地精部落中劈砍。",
	"Waving a black-and-red checkered banner, a dragonborn king charges into the fore. At his sides are warmages of all houses, a chessboard of elite arcanists, poised to turn the tide of battle.": "挥舞着黑红相间的格子旗帜，一位龙裔国王冲向前方。在他身边的是各个家族的暖男，一个精英奥术师的棋盘，准备扭转战局。",
	"The undisputed masters of cantrips, warmages turn the most fundamental types of magic into a deadly and precise art.": "作为无可争议的咒语大师，巫师将最基本的魔法类型变成了一种致命而精确的艺术。",
	"While other spellcasters aspire to grander and more complex spells, warmages refine and master the most fundamental magic: cantrips. Warmages wield their magic in the same way that a warrior uses a sword, bow, or axe: as weapons to be perfected and mastered, not as an unknowable force to be feared. In contrast to sorcerers and wizards, their magic is a trainable skill, one that can be mastered by almost anyone with discipline and aptitude. Therefore, warmages stand among the most fearsome of spellcasters, with only the most rudimentary of spells.": "当其他施法者渴望获得更宏大、更复杂的法术时，巫师们却在精炼和掌握最基本的魔法：咒语。暖男们挥舞着他们的魔法，就像战士们使用剑、弓或斧头一样：作为武器来完善和掌握，而不是作为一种不可知的力量来畏惧。与巫师和魔法师相比，他们的魔法是一种可训练的技能，几乎所有有纪律和能力的人都可以掌握。因此，巫师是最可怕的施法者之一，只拥有最基本的法术。",
	"Warmages have a long and storied history as masterful strategists and tacticians, both in grand battles and personal skirmishes. If a warmage is outgunned or outmanned, they'll try to outthink their foes, which works more often than not. They demonstrate an efficient kind of pragmatism, owing perhaps to their ability to solve many problems with just a few magical tools.": "暖男作为高超的战略家和战术家有着悠久的历史，无论是在大型战役还是在个人小规模冲突中。如果暖男的武器装备或人员不足，他们就会努力去思考他们的敌人，这往往是有效的。他们表现出一种高效的实用主义，也许是因为他们有能力用一些魔法工具解决很多问题。",
	"While some warmages are fully self-taught, the majority join a house: a loose confederation of warmages who practice together and share secrets of the trade. Houses teach invaluable battlefield strategy, but each individual house also touts their own brands of tactics and styles of magical tricks. The House of Knights, for example, emphasizes armor and martial prowess, whereas the House of Kings emphasizes battlefield strategy.": "虽然有些巫师是完全自学成才的，但大多数人都加入了一个家族：一个松散的巫师联盟，他们一起练习并分享行业的秘密。学院教授宝贵的战场策略，但每个学院也吹嘘他们自己的战术品牌和魔法技巧风格。例如，骑士团强调盔甲和武功，而国王团则强调战场策略。",
	"By way of metaphor, houses that value honor and teamwork above all else brand themselves after games of strategy, whereas those who epitomize self-reliance name themselves for games of chance. This division in the warmage houses is representative of a schism that dates back to the earliest warmage masters. Legend has it that the first two masters separated when one decided to found a college. The other, out of spite, built a casino outside its grounds.": "打个比方，重视荣誉和团队合作的家族以战略游戏为标志，而那些以自力更生为代表的家族则以机会游戏为标志。巫师协会的这种分裂代表了一种可以追溯到最早的巫师大师们的分裂。传说中，最初的两位大师在其中一位决定创办一所学院时分开了。另一位则出于怨恨，在其院外建了一个赌场。",
	"Warmages come from all walks of life, so as you build yours, consider where you first learned the fundamentals of magic, which you would go on to perfect. You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be self-taught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character's history with magic.": "暖炉来自各行各业，所以当你建立你的暖炉时，考虑一下你在哪里第一次学会了魔法的基本原理，你将继续完善这些原理。你可能从一个冒险家朋友那里学到了咒语，或者在巫师培训的早期阶段。你甚至可能是自学成才。选择一个最适合你的角色的魔法历史的奥术入门。",
	"Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot? Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal?": "此外，考虑你对整个魔法的感觉。你是否羡慕其他的施法者，或者你有信心无论如何你都能胜过他们？你是否曾经渴望成为一名巫师，但发现你永远无法凝聚足够的真正魔法来形成一个法术槽？你选择温热术是为了将你的天赋磨练到绝对的巅峰，还是选择它来挥舞没有战士可以匹敌的力量？",
	"Lastly, consider your prospective warmage House. Though you don't choose one until reaching 3rd level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights.": "最后，考虑一下你未来的暖气屋。虽然你在达到第三级之前不会选择一个，但你的愿望可能会决定你最喜欢哪个学院。如果你想涉足更大的奥术魔法，那么主教院是最合适的。如果前线的刀剑交锋引起你的兴趣，可以考虑骑士院。",
	"You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the House of Knights. Then choose the chill touch, force dart, force weapon, and phantom grapnel cantrips, and the Adventurer Arcane Initiation. Pick any background that emphasizes your magical discipline.": "你可以通过以下建议迅速成为一名暖男。首先，智力应该是你的最高能力分数，其次是体质。如果你打算加入骑士团，那么力量就是你的第三高分。然后选择寒冰之触、强力镖、强力武器和幻影弹片等咒语，以及冒险家的奥术启动。选择任何强调你的魔法学科的背景。",
	"A collage of diagrams, maps, and small items litters the wall, pinned with nails and connected by a spiderweb of colorful strings. An elf stands nearby, contemplating the mystery splayed out in front of her and readying her crossbow for work.": "墙上堆满了图表、地图和小物品，用钉子钉住，用五颜六色的绳子连接成蜘蛛网。一个精灵站在附近，思索着摆在她面前的谜题，并准备好她的弩箭。",
	"A half-orc wearing a wide-brimmed hat leafs through a thick tome, double-checking the preparations: a sturdy net trap, holy symbols on the doors, cloves of garlic, and several dozen wooden stakes. The preparations made, the half-orc slinks into the shadows and readies himself for the bloodshed.": "一个戴着宽边帽的半兽人翻阅着一本厚厚的书，反复检查准备工作：一个坚固的网状陷阱，门上的神圣符号，大蒜丁香，以及几十根木桩。准备工作完成后，半兽人溜进阴影中，为流血事件做好准备。",
	"Hastily tracing symbols in chalk, a human wearing a long coat whirls about in a wide arc, completing a rough magic circle in mere seconds. A monstrously fat demon, blood dripping with its drool, lunges at him, but instead impacts off an invisible magical barrier, a cylinder raised from the circle's edge. The fiend howls with rage, and the inquisitor breathes a sigh of relief.": "一个身穿长衫的人匆匆忙忙地用粉笔描画符号，在一个宽阔的弧线上打转，仅仅几秒钟就完成了一个粗糙的魔法圈。一个肥胖的恶魔，口水滴着血，向他扑来，但却撞上了一个无形的魔法屏障，一个从圆圈边缘升起的圆柱体。恶魔愤怒地嚎叫着，而审问者则松了一口气。",
	"Supernatural detectives and monster slayers, investigators are always on the hunt for malevolent outsiders. Whenever evil seeps into the world—be it fiends, undead, or strange abominations from beyond the stars—investigators will be the first to locate them and banish their foul corruption from the mortal plane.": "调查员是超自然的侦探和怪物杀手，他们总是在追捕邪恶的外来者。每当邪恶渗入世界--无论是恶魔、亡灵，还是来自星际之外的奇怪憎恶--调查员都会第一个找到他们，并将他们的肮脏腐败从凡间驱逐出去。",
	"There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands at a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night.": "有比时间更古老的力量，有比最邪恶的人更阴险的敌人，有比神灵更巨大的生命。世界站在悲惨和恐怖的悬崖边上，每晚都受到黑暗特工和成群怪物的威胁。调查员们冒着自己的生命和理智的危险，穿透匍匐在阴影中的邪恶，将其从世界上驱逐。他们的战斗是永无止境的，因为胜利只是把末日推迟了一个晚上。",
	"Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they often uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake.": "调查员追踪超自然的威胁，从无体的灵魂，到邪恶的吸血鬼和狼人，到恶魔和魔鬼的入侵。在他们的调查中，他们经常会发现一些秘密的邪教组织和受人指责的个人，他们把这些超自然的威胁带到了这里。他们的目标始终是通过任何必要的手段来阻止这些邪恶的人，必要时诉诸于诡计、欺骗、魔法和流血。对于调查员来说，当世界处于危险之中时，没有什么策略是不可想象的。",
	"Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters' powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams—everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator's occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire's fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs.": "即使他们努力遏制其对整个世界的影响，调查员也会涉足禁忌的魔法，以使自己在对抗超自然威胁时获得优势。有准备的调查员会保留一本库存充足的魔法秘籍，其中包括仪式、咒语、关于怪物力量和弱点的笔记、毒药配方和奥术图解--在平等基础上对抗敌人所需的一切。即便如此，调查员的职业也是危险的。一本魔法书可能会写出吸血鬼对阳光的恐惧和对银的厌恶，但这对他们的獠牙没有什么妨碍。",
	"As you build your investigator, consider what sort of supernatural threat first drove you to investigating and combating the occult. Did one of your family members strike a bargain with a fiend? Were you kidnapped by a cabal of vampires or a pack of lycanthropes? Did you stumble across evidence of an eldritch abomination, such as a Great Old One? The type of creature you first did battle with likely shaped your tools and methods later on.": "当你建立你的调查员时，考虑是什么样的超自然威胁首先驱使你去调查和打击神秘学。你的某个家庭成员是否与恶魔达成了交易？你是被一群吸血鬼或狼人绑架了吗？你是否偶然发现了长生不老的证据，比如一个伟大的老家伙？你第一次与之战斗的生物类型很可能塑造了你以后的工具和方法。",
	"Did you apprentice under a seasoned monster hunter, learning the ropes of tracking a threat, uncovering its weaknesses, and setting a trap for it? Or did you strike out on your own, compiling your own grimoire from hard-earned research? Perhaps you learned everything about monster hunting from someone else's grimoire, a masterwork containing an abridged library of occult knowledge and a lifetime of experience. It's even possible that you signed a contract with a minor fiend and turned to supernatural investigation in a last-ditch effort to save your soul.": "你是在经验丰富的怪物猎人手下当学徒，学习追踪威胁的技巧，发现其弱点，并为其设置陷阱？或者你自己出击，通过艰苦的研究编撰自己的魔法书？也许你从别人的魔法书里学到了关于猎杀怪物的一切，那是一部包含了神秘知识和一生经验的节选图书馆的杰作。甚至有可能你与一个小恶魔签订了合同，转而从事超自然调查，为拯救你的灵魂做最后的努力。",
	"Follow these suggestions to build an investigator quickly: Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength. Choose any background. Then, select the rituals {@spell clue|VSS}, {@spell comprehend languages|phb}, {@spell detect magic|phb}, and {@spell transient bulwark|VSS} to add to your grimoire.": "遵循这些建议来快速建立一个调查员。智力应该是你最高的能力分数，其次是灵巧或力量。选择任何背景。然后，选择仪式{@spell clue|VSS}、{@spell comprehend languages|phb}、{@spell detect magic|phb}和{@spell transient bulwark|VSS}来加入你的魔法书。",
	"Three old crones stoop over a boiling cauldron filled with all manner of bizarre filth, churning and bubbling with a noxious fume. In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one even cackles loudly at what she sees.": "三位老妪在一个沸腾的大锅前弯腰，大锅里装满了各种奇异的污物，搅动着，冒着有毒的烟雾。在大锅上方的烟雾和水汽中，三人可以辨认出一些重要的形状和数字，其中一个人甚至对她所看到的东西大声地笑了起来。",
	"A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure noone is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree's bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavy-set boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy's eyes.": "一个年轻女孩坐在树下，远离其他孩子玩耍的地方。她瞥了一眼，确保没有人在看，然后对着空旷的空气打了一个响指。沉默片刻后，一只黑猫出现在树弯处，与女孩对视，用一种奇怪的智慧盯着她看了很久。她对其中一个玩耍的孩子做了个手势，那是一个身材魁梧的男孩，脸上永远挂着一副皱纹；猫明白了。它徘徊在男孩身边，伸出爪子，变得很低，准备扑向男孩的眼睛。",
	"A young elf intently mutters something underneath his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony.": "一个年轻的精灵每次呼气时，都会在口中仔细地嘀咕些什么。只有他自己能看到，一串最肮脏的魔法从他身上蜿蜒而出，抓住了一个冲锋的兽人，兽人痛苦地跪在地上。",
	"Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts.": "女巫被如此黑暗的魔法所困扰，在她们的本质上印下了持久的阴影。仅仅通过个性的力量，她们就能将这种黑暗向外扩散，给生物施以魔法，施以操纵性的咒语，甚至用她们的思想来指挥一个熟悉的人。",
	"While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With gruesome effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torture which plagues them.": "当其他人受到魔法的祝福时，女巫却受到魔法的诅咒。受到一些可恨的奥术的影响，不管是意外还是故意，女巫都被它的日常折磨弄得里外扭曲。通过可怕的努力，她们可以将这种力量转化为法术，用困扰她们的同样的折磨来折磨别人。",
	"Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions about them, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night which prey on innocent people. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.": "几乎无一例外，女巫都被人害怕和憎恨。他们是一些关于他们的误解的受害者，通常将他们与女巫和其他掠夺无辜者的夜间邪恶生物联系起来。因此，已知的女巫面临着巨大的个人危险，通常可以发现她们居住在城镇居民很少涉足的文明郊区。这对阻止猎杀女巫和烧死女巫没有什么作用，但提供了某种程度的安全。",
	"In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer to healer to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches move frequently, never residing in one place for too long.": "在现实中，很少有人选择成为女巫，他们中的许多人都能熟练地隐藏在社会中，用他们的魔法来充当一些角色，从预言家到治疗师到药剂师。被指控为女巫会带来严重的后果，无论其说法是否正确，所以聪明的女巫会经常搬家，从不在一个地方居住太长时间。",
	"It is rare to find a witch without his or her constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch's familiar with good reason is ubiquitous to common folk. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.": "很少有女巫没有他或她的常伴--熟悉的人。尽管其他施法者也可能召唤出家人，但女巫的家人对普通人来说是无处不在的，理由很充分。女巫掌握直观的魔法，并与她们的家人有很深的联系。因此，他们可以召唤出更多奇特的家族成员，并比其他施法者更迅速地指挥他们。",
	"Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch's curse and think about how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart?": "创造一个女巫必然涉及到你的背景故事中一个强大的、恶意的诅咒。谁下的？你是否为了权力而把诅咒加在自己身上？你的整个血统在几代人之前就被诅咒了，导致了女巫的血统，还是另一个施法者用险恶的、被禁止的魔法诅咒了你一辈子？决定你的女巫诅咒的性质，想想你与它的关系。你是否觉得诅咒暗中是一种祝福，还是复仇的欲望在你心中燃烧？",
	"What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power of this curse outwards into hexes and spells?": "诅咒对你的个性和思想有什么负面的影响？你是否被鬼魂缠身，或者你的思想被破坏性的想法所困扰？你感觉如何操纵这个诅咒的力量向外转化为六合彩和咒语？",
	"Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic.": "与你的总经理合作，确定世界上对女巫的看法。他们是否害怕、被烧、被迫害？你是一个公开的女巫吗？你方的其他角色是否知道你是女巫？有些女巫对自己的魔法来源讳莫如深，或者自称是魔法师或巫师，以掩盖她们魔法的真正黑暗。",

	"Risk is in a gunslinger's blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive.": "风险存在于枪手的血液中。他们是大胆的叛逆者，与传统背道而驰，用危险而不雅的枪械开辟新的道路。枪手因靠智慧生存而臭名昭著，依靠瞬间的时机和相当多的运气来生存。",
	"Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Only the truly fearless seek to master it, for one must be mad or have nerves of steel to weather the risk of its use. But those who call themselves gunslingers are fearless combatants, hurling death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Adapted for shootouts, gunslingers are mobile and daring, knowing that life or death hangs on snap decision-making and one's own mettle.": "黑火药不适合胆小的人。它的雷鸣般的掌声是不稳定和不精确的--是一种勉强控制的针对敌人的爆炸。只有真正的无畏者才会寻求掌握它，因为一个人必须是疯子或有钢铁般的神经才能经受住使用它的风险。但那些自称是枪手的人是无畏的战斗者，在咆哮的嘈杂声中从他们的枪中抛出死亡。为适应枪战，枪手们机动而大胆，知道生死取决于快速决策和自己的胆量。",
	"A gunslinger's explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers will often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude which earns them few friends and bountiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and take great lengths to go unnoticed, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle.": "枪手的爆炸性生活方式很适合游荡和冒险。枪手往往会先开枪，后问话，这种态度为他们赢得了很少的朋友和大量的敌人。在他们的旅行中，大多数枪手都很隐蔽，并竭力不被人注意，以免他们被有仇必报的老对手发现。",
	"Yet, their skills are not unneeded. Anyone requiring protection or revenge of their own can count on a gunslinger to be in need of an odd job when they roll into town. After all, skill with a gun is always in demand somewhere.": "然而，他们的技能并不是不需要的。任何需要保护或报复自己的人都可以指望枪手在进城时需要打杂。毕竟，某个地方总是需要用枪的技巧。",
	"When creating your gunslinger, consider where firearms fit in the campaign's world and what the common perceptions are of those who use them. If firearms are the norm, your gunslinger might be a mercenary or militia fighter. If firearms are rare, your gunslinger might be one of a kind, a trailblazer in new types of warfare.": "在创造你的枪手时，考虑枪支在活动世界中的位置，以及对使用枪支的人的普遍看法。如果枪支是常态，你的枪手可能是一个雇佣兵或民兵战士。如果枪支很稀少，你的枪手可能是独一无二的，是新类型战争的开拓者。",
	"It's also not unusual for a gunslinger to be haunted by their past. Did some event drive you to the gun and motivate you to travel? Is there a bounty on your head in one or more areas? Do you have any old enemies that seek you for revenge?": "一个枪手被他们的过去所困扰也是很正常的。是否有什么事件驱使你拿起了枪，促使你去旅行？是否有一个或多个地区在悬赏你的头？你是否有旧日的敌人找你报仇？",

	"Starting at 10th level, you have discovered a way to deflect harmful projectiles by reverse engineering a plasma bomb. As a reaction when you would be hit by a ranged weapon attack that deals force, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage, you can roll a {@dice d6}. On a roll of 6, the attack misses you.": "从10级开始，你发现了一种通过逆向工程的等离子体炸弹来转移有害射弹的方法。当你被一个造成力量、闪电、坏死或辐射伤害的远程武器攻击击中时，作为一种反应，你可以掷出一个（%0%）。如果掷出6分，攻击就会打偏。",
	"At 18th level, you create a fist-sized \"discharge device\" that can absorb, store, and redirect small amounts of any energy that hits you. When you use your Electromagnetic Shield feature, regardless of your roll, your discharge device gains 1 charge, to a maximum of 10. Charges last for 24 hours. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend any number of stored charges and make a ranged attack roll against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes {@dice 1d8} force or radiant damage (your choice) for each charge expended.": "在18级时，你创造了一个拳头大小的 \"放电装置\"，可以吸收、储存和重新定向少量的任何击中你的能量。当你使用你的电磁盾功能时，无论你如何翻滚，你的放电装置都会获得1次充电，最多10次。充电时间持续24小时。作为你回合的额外行动，你可以消耗任何数量的存储电荷，并对60英尺内的目标进行一次远程攻击。一旦命中，目标就会因每一次消耗的电荷而受到{@dice 1d8}武力或辐射伤害（你选择）。",
	"While many mad bombers aren't actually mad, it takes a special kind of crazy to devote one's life to studying explosives.

	"At 6th level, you've learned how to set bombs to explode on a delay. When you take the {@action Use an Object} action to prime a bomb and throw it, you can set a duration for its detonation, which can be any number of rounds (any increment of 6 seconds) up to one minute. Following this duration, the bomb detonates at the end of your turn.": "在6级的时候，你已经学会了如何设置炸弹的延迟爆炸。当你采取{@action Use an Object}行动给炸弹填料并投掷它时，你可以为它的引爆设定一个持续时间，这个持续时间可以是任何数量的回合（6秒的任何增量），最多1分钟。在这个持续时间之后，炸弹会在你的回合结束时引爆。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you have developed an elemental plating to protect you from hazardous energies. You gain resistance to your choice of acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage and can change your selection whenever you finish a long rest.": "从10级开始，你已经开发出一种元素镀层来保护你免受危险能量的伤害。你获得了对你所选择的酸、冷、火或闪电伤害的抵抗力，并且每当你完成一次长时间的休息就可以改变你的选择。",

A black powder bomb has {@dice d12} damage dice.": "从18级开始，你可以制作可怕的黑火药炸弹。通过将你的炸弹的爆炸试剂换成黑火药，你可以把它变成黑火药炸弹。黑火药炸弹有{@dice d12}的伤害骰子。",
	"The study of alchemy is fundamentally the study of transformation. All alchemists transmute mundane materials into magical substances: potions, elixirs, and bombs, yet some take it one step further. You have discovered the secrets of the mutagen, the very keystone of transmutation, which allows you to transform your very body, gaining supernatural strength or speed, sprouting additional limbs or claws, or thickening your skin into a stony aegis.": "炼金术的研究从根本上说是对转化的研究。所有的炼金术士都将世俗的材料转化为神奇的物质：药水、灵药和炸弹，但有些人却更进一步。你已经发现了诱变剂的秘密，它是转化的关键，它使你能够改变你的身体，获得超自然的力量或速度，长出额外的四肢或爪子，或使你的皮肤变厚成为一个石质护罩。"
