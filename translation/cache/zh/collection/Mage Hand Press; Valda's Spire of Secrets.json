	"As constructs, geppettin do not age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient.": "作为建构体，Geppettin不会衰老，一旦成为有意识的人，就会变得成熟。",
	"Geppettin, as varied as they are, run the gamut of alignments. Raggedies are generally good, bisques tend towards evil, and marionettes are usually in between": "Geppettin，就像他们一样变化多端，有各种不同的取向。褴褛的人一般是好的，假人倾向于邪恶，而牵线木偶通常介于两者之间。",
	"Geppettin have superior vision in dim light and darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.": "Geppettin在昏暗的光线和黑暗中拥有卓越的视觉。你可以在昏暗的光线下看到你周围60英尺内的东西，就像亮光一样，而黑暗中的东西就像昏暗的光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.": "即使你是被建造的，你也是一个活生生的生物。你对非魔法疾病有免疫力。你不需要吃或呼吸，但如果你愿意，你可以摄取食物和饮料。",
	"Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. You can still be placed into a torpor by sleepinducing magic.": "你不是在睡觉，而是每天进入4小时的不活动状态。在这种状态下，你不会做梦；你完全意识到你的周围环境，并像平常一样注意到接近的敌人和其他事件。你仍然可以通过诱导睡眠的魔法进入昏睡状态。",
	"Geppettin are generally indistinguishable from non-living dolls of the same type. Because of that, they can be very stealthy when required. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks you make to appear as a mundane toy": "Geppettin通常与同类型的非活体娃娃没有区别。正因为如此，他们在需要时可以非常隐蔽。你在进行魅力（欺骗）检查时有优势，你可以作为一个普通的玩具出现。",
	"Geppettin can read and write Common as well as one other language based on their creator's race (your choice).": "Geppettin可以读写普通话，以及根据他们的创造者的种族（你的选择）的一种其他语言。",
	"\"As soon as he reached home, Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette.\"": "\"一到家，杰佩托就拿起他的工具，开始切割和塑造木头，做成一个木偶。\"",
	"Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren't manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.": "Geppettin是孩子们的欢乐，它就像木头、布或瓷器制成的活的玩物。虽然很容易被误认为是木偶，但geppettin并不是由一个看不见的木偶师操纵的；它们是有生命的，有知觉的，独立的。",
	"As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities with each other that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not just freak mishaps of magic. While it may be that there are dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, a significant number of them have come to life on their own.": "作为一个种族，Geppettin是一个奇特的存在。虽然稀少，但他们的数量足够多，而且彼此之间有足够多的相似之处，可以算作一个真正的人种，而不仅仅是魔法的畸形失误。虽然可能有专门的geppettin创造者，就像golems一样，但有相当数量的geppettin是靠自己的力量活过来的。",
	"Physically, geppettin are quite small, often slightly shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by the materials of which they are composed: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and raggedy are made of fabric.": "从身体上看，geppettin是相当小的，通常比半身人略短。他们的身体特征因类型不同而有很大差异，但他们几乎都是人形的。为了简单起见，geppettin按其组成材料进行分类： bisque是瓷器，木偶是木头，而褴褛的是织物。",
	"Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience seems to grant them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins.": "尽管它们是由一些脆弱的材料制成的，但有意识似乎赋予它们一种奇怪的坚韧。此外，由于他们的非生命性质，他们从不饥饿，很少疲倦，并且善于表现得无害。大多数人在娱乐界找到了某种形式的工作或职业，但也有少数人作为间谍和刺客获得了巨大的成功。",
	"Though they bring delight to children, geppettin instill a cold fear in many adults—the type of fear that accompanies the uncanny realization that something inanimate is, in fact, alive. A person's first reactions to a geppettin can be most telling, and usually fall into two camps: those that find the geppettin delightful, perhaps recalling cherished childhood memories; and those that are taken by an unnerving phobia, feeling a sudden chill upon seeing a doll move of its own impetus.": "虽然它们给孩子们带来了快乐，但在许多成年人中，geppettin却灌输了一种冷酷的恐惧--那种伴随着不可思议的意识的恐惧，即无生命的东西实际上是活的。一个人对geppettin的第一反应是最有说服力的，通常分为两个阵营：那些觉得geppettin很有趣的人，也许会回忆起珍贵的童年记忆；以及那些被一种令人不安的恐惧症所困扰的人，在看到玩偶在自己的推动下移动时感到突然的寒冷。",
	"Like other constructs, geppettin rarely name themselves. Typically, a construct has no conception that living creatures obsessively name everything, and have a name bestowed upon them—in this case, geppettin are normally named by children, or are given terms of endearment by adults.": "像其他构造体一样，geppettin很少给自己起名字。通常情况下，构造体不知道生物会痴迷地给所有东西起名字，并给它们起一个名字--在这种情况下，geppettin通常由孩子们命名，或者由成年人给予爱称。",
	"None can say where this tradition originated, but mouselings hold to it strongly. If one is seen without a hood, it is a sure sign of disgrace and exile, the most personal punishment a village of mouselings can inflict.": "没有人可以说这一传统起源于哪里，但捕鼠者强烈地坚持它。如果一个人被看到没有戴头罩，那肯定是耻辱和流放的标志，这是一个村子的鼠人所能施加的最个人的惩罚。",

	"Mandrakes are known to keep centuries-old concords known only to the oldest of creatures. Though they stay neutral in most matters, they tend to lean toward lawful alignments.": "众所周知，曼德拉克斯保持着只有最古老的生物才知道的几个世纪的协约。虽然他们在大多数问题上保持中立，但他们倾向于合法的取向。",

Additionally, you can breathe through your leaves and extremities, and can absorb water and nutrients through your feet.": "尽管你不完全是植物，但你仍然拥有许多与植物相同的特征。只要你每天在阳光直射下至少4小时，你就不需要进食。此外，你可以通过你的叶子和四肢进行呼吸，并可以通过你的脚吸收水和营养物质。",
	"Even if you aren't proficient in Stealth, you can add your proficiency bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks that you make to hide in natural environments, such as forests.": "即使你不精通隐身术，你也可以将你的熟练度加到你在自然环境中隐藏的灵巧（隐身）检查上，例如森林。",
	"You know the {@spell shillelagh} cantrip and can target yourself with the spell, treating one of your limbs as a club instead of an unarmed strike. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the {@spell goodberry} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the barkskin spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.": "你知道{@spell shillelagh}的咒语，并能以自己为目标施法，把你的一个肢体当作棍棒而不是徒手攻击。当你达到3级时，你可以用这个特性施放一次（%1%）的咒语，并在你完成长时间休息时重新获得施放能力。当你达到5级时，你可以用这个特质施放一次巴克斯坦法术，并在完成长时间休息后重新获得施放能力。智慧是你对这些法术的施法能力。",

You can also communicate simple ideas to nonmagical plants and can question plants about events that occurred nearby during the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.": "你可以说、读、写普通话。你还可以与非魔法植物交流简单的想法，并可以向植物询问过去一天中在附近发生的事件，获得关于已经过去的生物、天气和其他情况的信息。",
	"\"It was an ancient thing of moss-covered wood which creaked like a greatoak as it breathed, but I'll never forget its eyes: those glowing points were a thing of the fey, a thing of the deep woods forgotten to man.\"": "\"它是一个古老的长满苔藓的木头，呼吸时像大橡树一样吱吱作响，但我永远不会忘记它的眼睛：那些发光的点是精灵的东西，是被人类遗忘的深林里的东西。\"",
	"Laymen believe that mandrakes are screaming, crying babies grown from the roots of a plant. However, small, wailing mandrakes are those which are harvested too early; literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, they emerge fully formed, able to mature into great and powerful tree people.": "外行人认为曼陀罗是由植物的根部生长出来的尖叫、哭泣的婴儿。然而，小而哭的曼陀罗是那些过早收获的植物；实际上是仍处于婴儿期的儿童。如果让它们在收获前生长一年零一天，它们就会完全成形，能够成熟为伟大而强大的树人。",
	"With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that while mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, they have become something midway between animal and plant through some strange magic or stranger evolution": "曼陀罗有着厚厚的树皮和生长在其四肢的叶子，你可以理解为曼陀罗只是奇怪的植物、树人或有生命的树木。这甚至可能是部分真实的：虽然曼陀罗起源于某种植物的祖先，但通过一些奇怪的魔法或奇怪的进化，它们已经成为介于动物和植物之间的东西。",
	"Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes. They bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone.": "曼德拉的解剖结构充满了悖论。它们流淌着红宝石般的汁液，让人联想到血液和树液。它们的心脏，看起来像一个根结，将其泵送到身体周围，用叶子和四肢上的特殊孔隙携带的氧气来充实它。根据偏好，曼陀罗可以沐浴在阳光下，或食用活物来获取营养，甚至可以通过它们的脚来吸收营养，不过它们很少只靠阳光和水来生存。",
	"Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates for her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids for aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors.": "炼金术士和奥术师都对曼陀罗搔首弄姿，但德鲁伊知道它们是站在动物和植物领域之间的绿色使者，为所有各方带来和平。在德鲁伊的传统中，曼陀罗是大自然母亲自己的独特、古老的构造，旨在作为她的意志的代表。曼陀罗被古老的德鲁伊认为是将精灵与森林和矮人与山峦结合在一起；只是随着人类的崛起和他们对神灵的偏爱，大多数生物才忘记了自然母亲和她的半植物大使。",
	"Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved.": "今天，曼陀罗已经很少见了，它们在村庄和城市与真正的荒野交汇处附近的森林里安家。人类传说曼陀罗会对进入其领地的人大打出手，但德鲁伊和那些尊重森林古老传统的人知道，这种愤怒很少是不应该的。",
	"Taking their names from the old spirits of the forest, which have long been forgotten by men, mandrakes treat all names with great reverence": "曼陀罗的名字来自森林中的古老精灵，这些精灵早已被人类遗忘，曼陀罗对所有的名字都非常敬重。",

	"Though the tiny, big-eared mousefolk are often overlooked by larger creatures, history is brimming with stories of gallant mouse-knights staring down dragons, crossing blades with warlords, and charging into grand battles. It happens that few histories are written about the valor of mousefolk—though many more should be—yet they make appearances in legend all the same, their bravery cementing their place in history.": "虽然小小的、大耳朵的鼠族经常被大型生物所忽视，但历史上却充满了英勇的鼠族骑士与龙搏斗、与军阀交锋、冲入大战役的故事。碰巧的是，很少有关于鼠族的英勇事迹被记载下来--尽管应该有更多的记载--但他们还是在传说中出现了，他们的勇敢巩固了他们在历史上的地位。",
	"Even excluding the long and proud history of mouse-knights, few mousefolk are apt to fear either big folk or monsters. Mousefolk are good to their neighbors and rarely pick fights; after all, most folk can be reasoned with. Those who can't be reasoned with, however, should rightly fear mousefolk striking at their knees. Mousefolk do not suffer bullies lightly.": "即使不考虑老鼠骑士的悠久而自豪的历史，也很少有老鼠族会害怕大人物或怪物。老鼠人对他们的邻居很好，很少挑起争端；毕竟，大多数人都可以被说服。然而，那些不能被说服的人，应该正确地害怕鼠人在他们的膝盖上动手。老鼠人不会轻易受欺负。",
	"The mousefolk language, Rodentia, has no written form. Thus, mousefolk preserve their history in story and in song passed from elders to children through the generations. Their oral tradition is rich, filled with stories of grand heroics, shrewd tricks, and swooning romance. Indeed, many mousefolk live to see themselves preserved in the legends of their people, their deeds remembered in a grand epic for the ages.": "鼠族的语言，Rodentia，没有书面形式。因此，鼠族用故事和歌声来保存他们的历史，这些故事和歌声由长者传给孩子，世代相传。他们的口述传统非常丰富，充满了伟大的英雄主义、精明的诡计和令人陶醉的浪漫故事。事实上，许多鼠族人活到现在，看到自己被保存在他们民族的传说中，他们的事迹被铭记在一部宏伟的史诗中，流传于世。",
	"Though ratlings have long abandoned the old ways, a mouseling is never to be seen without a hood.

What motivates you to keep fighting, even when you're at death's door?": "当创建一个监狱长时，考虑是什么驱动你的角色。是什么让你为他人举起你的盾牌？你是否为保护某个人或某个地方而战？对你的祖国或亲人的威胁可能是你的催化剂，但你也可能是为了打击对自然界的威胁而站起来。你的召唤是什么，你如何尊重它？是什么激励你继续战斗，即使你在死亡的边缘？",

This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.": "炼金炸弹是一个1磅重、苹果大小的球形玻璃或粘土烧瓶，里面装满了反应性化学品。一个装有试剂的较小的薄玻璃瓶悬浮在液体中，整个瓶子用软木塞或蜡封密封。化学品在混合后会发生剧烈爆炸。这发生在内瓶破裂时，通常是在炸弹撞击固体表面或导火线引爆小瓶内的小型炸药雷管之后。炸弹主要用于抵御敌人，但有创造力的炼金术士可能会为炸药找到更实用的用途，如拆除障碍物。",
	"More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions which replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as potions of healing, to the transformative, such as potions of gaseous form, to the downright deadly, such as potions of poison. Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right.": "更有经验的炼金术士学会将不太易挥发的物质混合成药水，即复制魔法效果的炼金术混合物。这些药水的范围很广，有药用的，如治疗药水；有转化的，如气态药水；也有直接致命的，如毒药药水。炼金术士是无可争议的药水大师，他们不断创新新的配方和制剂，将他们的药水改进为自己的魔法物品。",
	"The primary source of alchemy's power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher's stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher's stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets.": "炼金术力量的主要来源来自元素界。因此，炼金术士努力深入挖掘这种力量，研究和发现由元素组成的新化合物，这并不奇怪。炼金术的顶峰是哲学家之石，据传它能赋予持有者最高的元素力量。很少有炼金术士成功地创造出哲人石，更少有人能活着泄露它的秘密。",
	"When you create an alchemist, consider why your character studies alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power, or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability?": "当你创造一个炼金术士时，考虑你的角色为什么要研究炼金术。你是被其危险的力量所吸引，还是被其帮助他人的能力所吸引？你是否渴望使用魔法，但缺乏天赋或天生的能力？",
	"Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher's stone?": "你为什么要冒险？你在寻找新的炼金术配方或稀有成分吗？你是否像许多人一样，寻求哲学家的石头？",
	"Be sure to understand alchemy's place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity. Depending on the setting, you might be respected for your knowledge or feared for your destructive potential": "一定要了解炼金术在你的活动世界中的地位。你可能已经从一个大师那里学到了你的手艺，或者在大学里与工匠和巫师一起学习。你的手艺可能是普通的，也可能是奇特的。根据不同的背景，你可能因为你的知识而受到尊重，也可能因为你的破坏性潜力而受到畏惧。",
	"You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Choose any background.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快地做出一个炼金术士。首先，让智力成为你的最高能力得分，其次是灵巧。选择任何背景。",
	"An elf recites the motions again for the simplest spell she knows, repeating them until she knows they are perfect. With a single, precise stroke, she unleashes a wave of arcane energy, focused into a searing blue beam.": "一个精灵再次背诵了她所知道的最简单的咒语的动作，重复它们直到她知道它们是完美的。通过一个精确的动作，她释放了一波奥术能量，集中成一道灼热的蓝色光束。",
	"A tiefling waves her hands to conjure floating greatswords of humming blue energy, which dance about in mesmerizing and deadly arcs. One blade takes on an aspect of fire, and the other lightning, as she begins to cleave through the goblinoid horde.": "一个铁弗林挥舞着她的双手，变出了由嗡嗡作响的蓝色能量组成的浮动大剑，这些大剑以令人着迷和致命的弧线舞动。一把刀呈现出火的一面，另一把刀呈现出闪电的一面，她开始在地精部落中劈砍。",
	"Waving a black-and-red checkered banner, a dragonborn king charges into the fore. At his sides are warmages of all houses, a chessboard of elite arcanists, poised to turn the tide of battle.": "挥舞着黑红相间的格子旗帜，一位龙裔国王冲向前方。在他身边的是各个家族的暖男，一个精英奥术师的棋盘，准备扭转战局。",
	"The undisputed masters of cantrips, warmages turn the most fundamental types of magic into a deadly and precise art.": "作为无可争议的咒语大师，巫师将最基本的魔法类型变成了一种致命而精确的艺术。",
	"While other spellcasters aspire to grander and more complex spells, warmages refine and master the most fundamental magic: cantrips. Warmages wield their magic in the same way that a warrior uses a sword, bow, or axe: as weapons to be perfected and mastered, not as an unknowable force to be feared. In contrast to sorcerers and wizards, their magic is a trainable skill, one that can be mastered by almost anyone with discipline and aptitude. Therefore, warmages stand among the most fearsome of spellcasters, with only the most rudimentary of spells.": "当其他施法者渴望获得更宏大、更复杂的法术时，巫师们却在精炼和掌握最基本的魔法：咒语。暖男们挥舞着他们的魔法，就像战士们使用剑、弓或斧头一样：作为武器来完善和掌握，而不是作为一种不可知的力量来畏惧。与巫师和魔法师相比，他们的魔法是一种可训练的技能，几乎所有有纪律和能力的人都可以掌握。因此，巫师是最可怕的施法者之一，只拥有最基本的法术。",
	"Warmages have a long and storied history as masterful strategists and tacticians, both in grand battles and personal skirmishes. If a warmage is outgunned or outmanned, they'll try to outthink their foes, which works more often than not. They demonstrate an efficient kind of pragmatism, owing perhaps to their ability to solve many problems with just a few magical tools.": "暖男作为高超的战略家和战术家有着悠久的历史，无论是在大型战役还是在个人小规模冲突中。如果暖男的武器装备或人员不足，他们就会努力去思考他们的敌人，这往往是有效的。他们表现出一种高效的实用主义，也许是因为他们有能力用一些魔法工具解决很多问题。",
	"While some warmages are fully self-taught, the majority join a house: a loose confederation of warmages who practice together and share secrets of the trade. Houses teach invaluable battlefield strategy, but each individual house also touts their own brands of tactics and styles of magical tricks. The House of Knights, for example, emphasizes armor and martial prowess, whereas the House of Kings emphasizes battlefield strategy.": "虽然有些巫师是完全自学成才的，但大多数人都加入了一个家族：一个松散的巫师联盟，他们一起练习并分享行业的秘密。学院教授宝贵的战场策略，但每个学院也吹嘘他们自己的战术品牌和魔法技巧风格。例如，骑士团强调盔甲和武功，而国王团则强调战场策略。",
	"By way of metaphor, houses that value honor and teamwork above all else brand themselves after games of strategy, whereas those who epitomize self-reliance name themselves for games of chance. This division in the warmage houses is representative of a schism that dates back to the earliest warmage masters. Legend has it that the first two masters separated when one decided to found a college. The other, out of spite, built a casino outside its grounds.": "打个比方，重视荣誉和团队合作的家族以战略游戏为标志，而那些以自力更生为代表的家族则以机会游戏为标志。巫师协会的这种分裂代表了一种可以追溯到最早的巫师大师们的分裂。传说中，最初的两位大师在其中一位决定创办一所学院时分开了。另一位则出于怨恨，在其院外建了一个赌场。",
	"Warmages come from all walks of life, so as you build yours, consider where you first learned the fundamentals of magic, which you would go on to perfect. You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be self-taught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character's history with magic.": "暖炉来自各行各业，所以当你建立你的暖炉时，考虑一下你在哪里第一次学会了魔法的基本原理，你将继续完善这些原理。你可能从一个冒险家朋友那里学到了咒语，或者在巫师培训的早期阶段。你甚至可能是自学成才。选择一个最适合你的角色的魔法历史的奥术入门。",
	"Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot? Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal?": "此外，考虑你对整个魔法的感觉。你是否羡慕其他的施法者，或者你有信心无论如何你都能胜过他们？你是否曾经渴望成为一名巫师，但发现你永远无法凝聚足够的真正魔法来形成一个法术槽？你选择温热术是为了将你的天赋磨练到绝对的巅峰，还是选择它来挥舞没有战士可以匹敌的力量？",
	"Lastly, consider your prospective warmage House. Though you don't choose one until reaching 3rd level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights.": "最后，考虑一下你未来的暖气屋。虽然你在达到第三级之前不会选择一个，但你的愿望可能会决定你最喜欢哪个学院。如果你想涉足更大的奥术魔法，那么主教院是最合适的。如果前线的刀剑交锋引起你的兴趣，可以考虑骑士院。",
	"You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the House of Knights. Then choose the chill touch, force dart, force weapon, and phantom grapnel cantrips, and the Adventurer Arcane Initiation. Pick any background that emphasizes your magical discipline.": "你可以通过以下建议迅速成为一名暖男。首先，智力应该是你的最高能力分数，其次是体质。如果你打算加入骑士团，那么力量就是你的第三高分。然后选择寒冰之触、强力镖、强力武器和幻影弹片等咒语，以及冒险家的奥术启动。选择任何强调你的魔法学科的背景。",
	"A collage of diagrams, maps, and small items litters the wall, pinned with nails and connected by a spiderweb of colorful strings. An elf stands nearby, contemplating the mystery splayed out in front of her and readying her crossbow for work.": "墙上堆满了图表、地图和小物品，用钉子钉住，用五颜六色的绳子连接成蜘蛛网。一个精灵站在附近，思索着摆在她面前的谜题，并准备好她的弩箭。",
	"A half-orc wearing a wide-brimmed hat leafs through a thick tome, double-checking the preparations: a sturdy net trap, holy symbols on the doors, cloves of garlic, and several dozen wooden stakes. The preparations made, the half-orc slinks into the shadows and readies himself for the bloodshed.": "一个戴着宽边帽的半兽人翻阅着一本厚厚的书，反复检查准备工作：一个坚固的网状陷阱，门上的神圣符号，大蒜丁香，以及几十根木桩。准备工作完成后，半兽人溜进阴影中，为流血事件做好准备。",
	"Hastily tracing symbols in chalk, a human wearing a long coat whirls about in a wide arc, completing a rough magic circle in mere seconds. A monstrously fat demon, blood dripping with its drool, lunges at him, but instead impacts off an invisible magical barrier, a cylinder raised from the circle's edge. The fiend howls with rage, and the inquisitor breathes a sigh of relief.": "一个身穿长衫的人匆匆忙忙地用粉笔描画符号，在一个宽阔的弧线上打转，仅仅几秒钟就完成了一个粗糙的魔法圈。一个肥胖的恶魔，口水滴着血，向他扑来，但却撞上了一个无形的魔法屏障，一个从圆圈边缘升起的圆柱体。恶魔愤怒地嚎叫着，而审问者则松了一口气。",
	"Supernatural detectives and monster slayers, investigators are always on the hunt for malevolent outsiders. Whenever evil seeps into the world—be it fiends, undead, or strange abominations from beyond the stars—investigators will be the first to locate them and banish their foul corruption from the mortal plane.": "调查员是超自然的侦探和怪物杀手，他们总是在追捕邪恶的外来者。每当邪恶渗入世界--无论是恶魔、亡灵，还是来自星际之外的奇怪憎恶--调查员都会第一个找到他们，并将他们的肮脏腐败从凡间驱逐出去。",
	"There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands at a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night.": "有比时间更古老的力量，有比最邪恶的人更阴险的敌人，有比神灵更巨大的生命。世界站在悲惨和恐怖的悬崖边上，每晚都受到黑暗特工和成群怪物的威胁。调查员们冒着自己的生命和理智的危险，穿透匍匐在阴影中的邪恶，将其从世界上驱逐。他们的战斗是永无止境的，因为胜利只是把末日推迟了一个晚上。",
	"Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they often uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake.": "调查员追踪超自然的威胁，从无体的灵魂，到邪恶的吸血鬼和狼人，到恶魔和魔鬼的入侵。在他们的调查中，他们经常会发现一些秘密的邪教组织和受人指责的个人，他们把这些超自然的威胁带到了这里。他们的目标始终是通过任何必要的手段来阻止这些邪恶的人，必要时诉诸于诡计、欺骗、魔法和流血。对于调查员来说，当世界处于危险之中时，没有什么策略是不可想象的。",
	"Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters' powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams—everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator's occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire's fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs.": "即使他们努力遏制其对整个世界的影响，调查员也会涉足禁忌的魔法，以使自己在对抗超自然威胁时获得优势。有准备的调查员会保留一本库存充足的魔法秘籍，其中包括仪式、咒语、关于怪物力量和弱点的笔记、毒药配方和奥术图解--在平等基础上对抗敌人所需的一切。即便如此，调查员的职业也是危险的。一本魔法书可能会写出吸血鬼对阳光的恐惧和对银的厌恶，但这对他们的獠牙没有什么妨碍。",
	"As you build your investigator, consider what sort of supernatural threat first drove you to investigating and combating the occult. Did one of your family members strike a bargain with a fiend? Were you kidnapped by a cabal of vampires or a pack of lycanthropes? Did you stumble across evidence of an eldritch abomination, such as a Great Old One? The type of creature you first did battle with likely shaped your tools and methods later on.": "当你建立你的调查员时，考虑是什么样的超自然威胁首先驱使你去调查和打击神秘学。你的某个家庭成员是否与恶魔达成了交易？你是被一群吸血鬼或狼人绑架了吗？你是否偶然发现了长生不老的证据，比如一个伟大的老家伙？你第一次与之战斗的生物类型很可能塑造了你以后的工具和方法。",
	"Did you apprentice under a seasoned monster hunter, learning the ropes of tracking a threat, uncovering its weaknesses, and setting a trap for it? Or did you strike out on your own, compiling your own grimoire from hard-earned research? Perhaps you learned everything about monster hunting from someone else's grimoire, a masterwork containing an abridged library of occult knowledge and a lifetime of experience. It's even possible that you signed a contract with a minor fiend and turned to supernatural investigation in a last-ditch effort to save your soul.": "你是在经验丰富的怪物猎人手下当学徒，学习追踪威胁的技巧，发现其弱点，并为其设置陷阱？或者你自己出击，通过艰苦的研究编撰自己的魔法书？也许你从别人的魔法书里学到了关于猎杀怪物的一切，那是一部包含了神秘知识和一生经验的节选图书馆的杰作。甚至有可能你与一个小恶魔签订了合同，转而从事超自然调查，为拯救你的灵魂做最后的努力。",
	"Follow these suggestions to build an investigator quickly: Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength. Choose any background. Then, select the rituals {@spell clue|VSS}, {@spell comprehend languages|phb}, {@spell detect magic|phb}, and {@spell transient bulwark|VSS} to add to your grimoire.": "遵循这些建议来快速建立一个调查员。智力应该是你最高的能力分数，其次是灵巧或力量。选择任何背景。然后，选择仪式{@spell clue|VSS}、{@spell comprehend languages|phb}、{@spell detect magic|phb}和{@spell transient bulwark|VSS}来加入你的魔法书。",
	"Three old crones stoop over a boiling cauldron filled with all manner of bizarre filth, churning and bubbling with a noxious fume. In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one even cackles loudly at what she sees.": "三位老妪在一个沸腾的大锅前弯腰，大锅里装满了各种奇异的污物，搅动着，冒着有毒的烟雾。在大锅上方的烟雾和水汽中，三人可以辨认出一些重要的形状和数字，其中一个人甚至对她所看到的东西大声地笑了起来。",
	"A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure noone is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree's bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavy-set boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy's eyes.": "一个年轻女孩坐在树下，远离其他孩子玩耍的地方。她瞥了一眼，确保没有人在看，然后对着空旷的空气打了一个响指。沉默片刻后，一只黑猫出现在树弯处，与女孩对视，用一种奇怪的智慧盯着她看了很久。她对其中一个玩耍的孩子做了个手势，那是一个身材魁梧的男孩，脸上永远挂着一副皱纹；猫明白了。它徘徊在男孩身边，伸出爪子，变得很低，准备扑向男孩的眼睛。",
	"A young elf intently mutters something underneath his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony.": "一个年轻的精灵每次呼气时，都会在口中仔细地嘀咕些什么。只有他自己能看到，一串最肮脏的魔法从他身上蜿蜒而出，抓住了一个冲锋的兽人，兽人痛苦地跪在地上。",
	"Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts.": "女巫被如此黑暗的魔法所困扰，在她们的本质上印下了持久的阴影。仅仅通过个性的力量，她们就能将这种黑暗向外扩散，给生物施以魔法，施以操纵性的咒语，甚至用她们的思想来指挥一个熟悉的人。",
	"While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With gruesome effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torture which plagues them.": "当其他人受到魔法的祝福时，女巫却受到魔法的诅咒。受到一些可恨的奥术的影响，不管是意外还是故意，女巫都被它的日常折磨弄得里外扭曲。通过可怕的努力，她们可以将这种力量转化为法术，用困扰她们的同样的折磨来折磨别人。",
	"Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions about them, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night which prey on innocent people. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.": "几乎无一例外，女巫都被人害怕和憎恨。他们是一些关于他们的误解的受害者，通常将他们与女巫和其他掠夺无辜者的夜间邪恶生物联系起来。因此，已知的女巫面临着巨大的个人危险，通常可以发现她们居住在城镇居民很少涉足的文明郊区。这对阻止猎杀女巫和烧死女巫没有什么作用，但提供了某种程度的安全。",
	"In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer to healer to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches move frequently, never residing in one place for too long.": "在现实中，很少有人选择成为女巫，他们中的许多人都能熟练地隐藏在社会中，用他们的魔法来充当一些角色，从预言家到治疗师到药剂师。被指控为女巫会带来严重的后果，无论其说法是否正确，所以聪明的女巫会经常搬家，从不在一个地方居住太长时间。",
	"It is rare to find a witch without his or her constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch's familiar with good reason is ubiquitous to common folk. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.": "很少有女巫没有他或她的常伴--熟悉的人。尽管其他施法者也可能召唤出家人，但女巫的家人对普通人来说是无处不在的，理由很充分。女巫掌握直观的魔法，并与她们的家人有很深的联系。因此，他们可以召唤出更多奇特的家族成员，并比其他施法者更迅速地指挥他们。",
	"Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch's curse and think about how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart?": "创造一个女巫必然涉及到你的背景故事中一个强大的、恶意的诅咒。谁下的？你是否为了权力而把诅咒加在自己身上？你的整个血统在几代人之前就被诅咒了，导致了女巫的血统，还是另一个施法者用险恶的、被禁止的魔法诅咒了你一辈子？决定你的女巫诅咒的性质，想想你与它的关系。你是否觉得诅咒暗中是一种祝福，还是复仇的欲望在你心中燃烧？",
	"What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power of this curse outwards into hexes and spells?": "诅咒对你的个性和思想有什么负面的影响？你是否被鬼魂缠身，或者你的思想被破坏性的想法所困扰？你感觉如何操纵这个诅咒的力量向外转化为六合彩和咒语？",
	"Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic.": "与你的总经理合作，确定世界上对女巫的看法。他们是否害怕、被烧、被迫害？你是一个公开的女巫吗？你方的其他角色是否知道你是女巫？有些女巫对自己的魔法来源讳莫如深，或者自称是魔法师或巫师，以掩盖她们魔法的真正黑暗。",

	"Risk is in a gunslinger's blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive.": "风险存在于枪手的血液中。他们是大胆的叛逆者，与传统背道而驰，用危险而不雅的枪械开辟新的道路。枪手因靠智慧生存而臭名昭著，依靠瞬间的时机和相当多的运气来生存。",
	"Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Only the truly fearless seek to master it, for one must be mad or have nerves of steel to weather the risk of its use. But those who call themselves gunslingers are fearless combatants, hurling death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Adapted for shootouts, gunslingers are mobile and daring, knowing that life or death hangs on snap decision-making and one's own mettle.": "黑火药不适合胆小的人。它的雷鸣般的掌声是不稳定和不精确的--是一种勉强控制的针对敌人的爆炸。只有真正的无畏者才会寻求掌握它，因为一个人必须是疯子或有钢铁般的神经才能经受住使用它的风险。但那些自称是枪手的人是无畏的战斗者，在咆哮的嘈杂声中从他们的枪中抛出死亡。为适应枪战，枪手们机动而大胆，知道生死取决于快速决策和自己的胆量。",
	"A gunslinger's explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers will often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude which earns them few friends and bountiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and take great lengths to go unnoticed, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle.": "枪手的爆炸性生活方式很适合游荡和冒险。枪手往往会先开枪，后问话，这种态度为他们赢得了很少的朋友和大量的敌人。在他们的旅行中，大多数枪手都很隐蔽，并竭力不被人注意，以免他们被有仇必报的老对手发现。",
	"Yet, their skills are not unneeded. Anyone requiring protection or revenge of their own can count on a gunslinger to be in need of an odd job when they roll into town. After all, skill with a gun is always in demand somewhere.": "然而，他们的技能并不是不需要的。任何需要保护或报复自己的人都可以指望枪手在进城时需要打杂。毕竟，某个地方总是需要用枪的技巧。",
	"When creating your gunslinger, consider where firearms fit in the campaign's world and what the common perceptions are of those who use them. If firearms are the norm, your gunslinger might be a mercenary or militia fighter. If firearms are rare, your gunslinger might be one of a kind, a trailblazer in new types of warfare.": "在创造你的枪手时，考虑枪支在活动世界中的位置，以及对使用枪支的人的普遍看法。如果枪支是常态，你的枪手可能是一个雇佣兵或民兵战士。如果枪支很稀少，你的枪手可能是独一无二的，是新类型战争的开拓者。",
	"It's also not unusual for a gunslinger to be haunted by their past. Did some event drive you to the gun and motivate you to travel? Is there a bounty on your head in one or more areas? Do you have any old enemies that seek you for revenge?": "一个枪手被他们的过去所困扰也是很正常的。是否有什么事件驱使你拿起了枪，促使你去旅行？是否有一个或多个地区在悬赏你的头？你是否有旧日的敌人找你报仇？",

These dynamos can be configured to store their energy at a specific resonance, such that, when it is released, it perfectly replicates the effect of a spell.

While the city exists, it lives in harmony with its people, a delicate balance mediated by the urban druids. These urban druids belong to the Circle of the City and are a direct antithesis to the conventional idea of a druid; whereas a normal druid lives among majestic forests or breathtaking mountains and dresses in the greenery of the forest, an urban druid wears unassuming clothes and wanders the back alleys of a well-trodden city.

You are unaffected by this difficult terrain. Additionally, you can use your action on each of your turns to raise up to three low walls from the floor, each 2 and 1/2 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 1 foot deep. Such a wall can generally provide half cover for a Medium creature. These walls provide no instability in surrounding structures. This ability lasts for 1 minute. After this time, all components and walls magically revert to their original positions.": "你可以神奇地操纵60英尺内的建筑地板的组成部分--砖头、鹅卵石、木板和类似的物体。每个组件最多可以移动1英尺，并且不会造成其结构的不稳定。当你使用这个效果时，你可以使该区域内你选择的任何部分的地板变成困难地形，并且可以使站在其中一个部分的任何生物对你的法术救赎DC进行灵巧反射，否则就会跌倒（%0%）。你不会受到这种困难地形的影响。此外，你可以在每个回合使用你的行动，从地上升起最多三面低矮的墙，每面高2.5英尺，宽5英尺，深1英尺。这样的墙一般可以为一个中等生物提供一半的掩护。这些墙不会给周围的结构带来任何不稳定。这种能力持续1分钟。在这段时间之后，所有的组件和墙壁都会神奇地恢复到它们原来的位置。",

Its new position can't include spaces occoupied by creatures or objects. If you cause the wall to grow or shrink, you can only change its dimensions vertically. These changes to the wall create no instability in their structures. After 1 minute, the wall reverts to its original size and position.": "一面你能在30英尺内看到的墙会神奇地移动、增长、缩小或旋转。这堵墙必须是一个没有拐角的连续表面，最多只有1英尺厚，而且必须是由木头、石膏或石头制成，或者不是自然形成的。这面墙必须保持垂直，但你可以将它移动到它之前的位置的60英尺半径内的任何位置。它的新位置不能包括被生物或物体占据的空间。如果你使墙壁增大或缩小，你只能垂直地改变它的尺寸。墙的这些变化不会在其结构中产生不稳定。1分钟后，墙会恢复到它原来的尺寸和位置。",

At the end of this duration, all creatures and objects fall from the affected surfaces.": "此外，当你使用你的城市形状功能时，你可以沿着你选择的60英尺半径内的任何表面扭曲重力。在接下来的一分钟里，在这些表面之一的15英尺范围内的生物和物体都会向它下落，就像它是地面一样。生物可以在这个表面上行走，就像它是平地一样，即使这个表面与地面垂直或倒立。在这个持续时间结束时，所有的生物和物体都会从受影响的表面跌落。",
	"The druids that maintain and protect the land are deluded to think that they keep dominion over the natural world, for they stand guard over only a small fraction of it; far greater, and far wilder, is the deep.

But to have control of yourself, and true understanding of your soul, grants you a breadth of magic few can hope to equal.": "每当你被心碎、恐惧或悲伤的深渊所充斥时，一波波的奥术能量就会从你身上溢出来。你可能在巨大的悲剧发生时，或者在你因愤怒而颤抖时发现了魔法的火花，或者它可能一直在你的灵魂深处徘徊，只有在你失去控制时才会爆发出来。无论它是如何起源的，控制你的情绪和了解你自己是操纵你的奥术能量深井的关键。失去焦点，被你的情绪所支配，会让你所有的魔法以壮观和不可控制的方式流经你。但如果能控制自己，并真正了解自己的灵魂，就能赋予你的魔法广度，很少有人能望其项背。",
	"At 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Emotional Spells table. The list of spells you know from this table changes with your predominant emotional state. These emotions should be informed by your character's history as much as the current situation; however, the GM decides whether or not a situation is appropriate to inspire a specific emotional state. For example, a pitched life-or-death battle is unlikely to inspire love. If your emotions would be uncertain, choose this state randomly.": "在1级的时候，当你在这个等级中达到一定的水平时，你会学习额外的法术，如情绪法术表所示。你从这个表中知道的法术列表会随着你的主要情绪状态而改变。这些情绪应该由你的角色的历史和当前的情况来决定；然而，GM决定一个情况是否适合激发一个特定的情绪状态。例如，一场生死攸关的战斗不太可能激发出爱情。如果你的情绪会不确定，就随机选择这种状态。",
	"Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.": "每个法术对你来说都算作一个巫师法术，但不计入你所会的巫师法术数量。这些法术在你获得这个等级的时候不能被替换。",
	"Also at 1st level, you can use your action to probe the surface level of a creature's emotions. You must be able to see the creature, it must be within 30 feet of you, and it must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. You learn the creature's emotional state and, at the GM's discretion, one of the creature's Bonds.": "同样在第一层，你可以用你的行动来探测一个生物的情绪的表面层次。你必须能够看到该生物，它必须在你30英尺以内，并且它的智力必须在3以上。你可以了解该生物的情绪状态，并由GM决定，了解该生物的一种束缚。",
	"Starting at 6th level, you can channel great swings of emotional energy at a whim. You can use the following abilities, regardless of your emotional state:": "从6级开始，你可以随心所欲地引导情绪能量的巨大波动。无论你的情绪状态如何，你都可以使用以下能力。",

On a failed save, it takes {@dice 2d6} fire damage.": "{@bold Burning Rage.} 作为你回合的额外行动，你可以花费1个巫术点来点燃奥术之怒。在你下一个回合开始前，当一个生物进入你5英尺范围内或在那里开始它的回合时，它必须对你的法术救赎DC做一个灵巧的投掷。如果救赎失败，它将受到1%的火焰伤害。",
	"{@bold Crestfallen.} Beset by sorrow, you can spend 2 sorcery points as a bonus action on your turn to fade out the world. Until the start of your next turn, you are visibly transparent, and attack rolls against you have disadvantage. This effect ends early if you are hit by an attack.": "{@bold Crestfallen.}被悲伤所困扰，你可以在你的回合中花费2点巫术点数作为额外行动来淡化世界。直到你的下一个回合开始，你会明显地透明，对你的攻击卷轴有劣势。如果你被攻击击中，这个效果会提前结束。",

	"{@bold Moment of Bliss.} As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. If you end your turn in the air without anything holding you aloft, and you are within 30 feet of the ground, you float gently to the ground. Otherwise, you fall.": "{@bold Moment of Bliss.}作为一个额外的动作，你可以花费1个巫术点来获得一个相当于你行走速度的飞行速度，直到你的回合结束。如果你在空中没有任何东西支撑你，并且你在离地面30英尺以内，你会轻轻地飘到地面上。否则，你会坠落。",

If the creature fails its saving throw, you can use one of the following abilities on it:": "在14级时，你可以用你的行动来弯曲60英尺内你能看到的生物的情绪，该生物必须对你的法术救赎DC做出魅力救赎。如果该生物的自救失败，你可以对其使用以下能力之一。",
	"{@bold Charmed.} You spend 1 sorcery point, and the creature is {@condition charmed} by you for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to the creature.": "{@bold Charmed.} 你花费1个巫术点，该生物被你{@condition charmed}，持续1分钟。如果你或你的同伴对该生物做了任何有害的事情，这个效果会提前结束。",
	"{@bold Frenzied.} You spend 3 sorcery points to cause the creature to become frenzied for up to 1 minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one.": "{@bold Frenzied.}你花费3点巫术点数，使该生物变得狂热，持续1分钟。该生物在受到伤害时可以重复这个蓄力动作，如果成功则结束对自己的影响。狂乱的生物会失去区分敌我的能力，把它能看到的所有生物都视为敌人。在发狂时，该生物会从它能看到的范围内的生物中随机选择其攻击、法术和能力的目标，如果有任何生物挑起攻击，它必须进行一次机会攻击。",

	"By 18th level, you have mastery over your mercurial feelings. You know all of the spells on your Emotional Spells list at all times. Additionally, you learn the spell {@spell antipathy/sympathy|PHB}, which counts as a sorcerer spell for you and doesn't count against your total number of spells known. You can cast this spell by spending 10 sorcery points, instead of using a spell slot.": "到了18级，你已经掌握了你那多变的感情。你在任何时候都知道你情感法术列表上的所有法术。此外，你还学会了{@spell antipathy/sympathy|PHB}这个法术，它对你来说算作一个巫师法术，不计入你已知的法术总数。你可以通过花费10点巫术点数来施展这个法术，而不是使用一个法术槽。",
	"One of your ancestors came from beyond the looking glass; a strange world where everything is a twisted reflection of the true reality. As such, you have inherited amazing powers of mimicry and illusion that allow you to copy other people's abilities. To fight against you is almost akin to fighting one's own mirror image, something few warriors would relish.": "你的一位祖先来自望远镜之外；在这个奇怪的世界里，一切都只是真实现实的扭曲反映。因此，你继承了惊人的模仿和幻觉能力，使你能够复制其他人的能力。与你作战几乎等同于与自己的镜像作战，很少有战士会喜欢这样做。",
	"When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can duplicate the magic that affects you.

You can't use this ability to learn a spell that had no effect on you, even if it forced you to make a saving throw against it.": "当你在第1级选择这个起源时，你可以复制影响你的魔法。当一个法术以你为目标被施放，或者你在一个法术的影响范围内，你可以用你的反应来学习那个法术。你不能使用这个能力来学习一个对你没有影响的咒语，即使它迫使你对它做了一个蓄力动作。",
	"You can only learn a spell if it is of a level for which you have spell slots. You can learn two 1st-level spells using this ability, which don't count against the total number of sorcerer spells you know. When you gain 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th-level spells, you can learn 2 spells for each of those levels, for a total of 10 additional spells known.

When a creature casts a spell that calls for a saving throw to resist its effects and targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can attempt to reflect the spell's energy back against its caster. Spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (1 sorcery point for cantrips). If you succeed on your saving throw against the spell, the caster must also make a saving throw against the spell, using their own spell save DC. On a failed save, the caster suffers the effects of the spell as if you had cast it and they had been the original target or been within the area of the spell.": "在6级的时候，你可以把你的皮肤变成一面闪闪发光的镜子，反射魔法。当一个生物施展一个需要蓄力抵抗其效果的法术，并以你为目标或将你纳入其影响范围时，你可以尝试将该法术的能量反射给其施法者。花费相当于该法术等级的巫术点数（咒语为1巫术点数）。如果你对该咒语的蓄力成功，施法者也必须对该咒语进行蓄力，使用他们自己的咒语蓄力DC。在救赎失败的情况下，施法者会受到该法术的影响，就像你施放该法术并且他们是原始目标或在该法术的范围内一样。",

Masters of this school, however, walk the generations as planeswalkers walk the cosmos, literally ending most conflicts before they even begin.": "计时学派专注于驾驭和操纵流动的时间能量。这是一个危险的传统，因为减缓、逆转或转移时间流的做法可能会意外地将新手撕成碎片，使他们稀里糊涂地跨越千年，有时甚至将他们完全丢入一个新的时代，没有办法返回家园。然而，这个学派的大师们，就像行者在宇宙中行走一样，在大多数冲突开始之前就已经结束。",
	"Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, all spells with the chronomancy tag are added to the wizard spell list for you. Additionally, the time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 10 minutes per spell level.": "从你在2级时选择这个学派开始，所有带有计时标签的法术都会被加入到你的巫师法术列表中。此外，你必须花时间将一个法术复制到你的法术书中，每个法术等级的时间等于10分钟。",
	"At 2nd level, you can abate time while casting your spells. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend another spell slot of the same level to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "2级时，你可以在施法时消减时间。当你施放一个施法时间为1个行动的1级或更高等级的法术时，你可以消耗另一个相同等级的法术槽，将这次施法的施法时间改为1个额外行动。你可以使用这个功能的次数与你的智力修饰值相等（最少一次）。当你完成长期休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用次数。",
	"By 6th level, you can enter a state of heightened focus as an action, allowing you to perform certain tasks five times faster than normal while you concentrate on them like a spell. These tasks must be purely intellectual in nature, such as research, translation, or computation, and must be tasks you can complete alone; others can't understand your speech or meaningfully help while you are working at increased speed. Furthermore, attempting to cast a spell, perform a ritual, or move further than 10 feet from where you began instantly returns you to the normal flow of time with a feeling of faintness which prevents you from maintaining concentration for 1 minute.": "到了6级，你可以作为一个动作进入高度集中的状态，让你在像施法一样集中精力时，执行某些任务的速度比平时快5倍。这些任务必须是纯智力性质的，比如研究、翻译或计算，而且必须是你能独自完成的任务；在你以提高的速度工作时，其他人无法理解你的讲话或提供有意义的帮助。此外，试图施展法术、进行仪式或从你开始的地方移动超过10英尺，会使你立即回到正常的时间流中，并有一种晕眩的感觉，使你无法保持1分钟的注意力。",
	"At 10th level, when you cast a spell, you can delay its effect for one, two, or three turns. When the spell is cast, you choose the spell's target and the number of rounds to delay the spell, and you roll any relevant attack rolls. Any effects on the spell's targets, including saving throws, are resolved when the spell triggers at the start of your turn after the chosen number of rounds. If any conditions change between casting and when the spell takes effect that would make the spell impossible—such as the target leaving the spell's maximum range—the spell fails.": "在10级时，当你施展法术时，你可以将其效果延迟一个、两个或三个回合。当施法时，你选择施法的目标和延迟施法的回合数，并滚动任何相关的攻击卷。对法术目标的任何影响，包括蓄力，都会在所选回合数后你的回合开始时触发法术时解决。如果在施法和咒语生效之间有任何条件发生变化，导致咒语不可能实现--比如目标离开了咒语的最大范围--则咒语失败。",
	"By 14th level, you have unlocked the power to turn back time and retrace your steps, correcting your most egregious errors. Whenever you finish a long rest, you are actually beginning your second attempt at the day's events. You are accompanied by a temporal shadow, an echo of your first time experiencing the day, which you follow perfectly in order to repeat the day's events. Acting on your foreknowledge destroys your temporal shadow until you finish a long rest, but allows you to use one of the following abilities:": "到了第14关，你已经解锁了时光倒流的能力，可以回溯你的脚步，纠正你最令人震惊的错误。每当你完成一次长时间的休息，你实际上是在开始你对这一天的事件的第二次尝试。你有一个时间上的影子伴随着你，这是你第一次经历这一天的回声，你完美地跟随它，以重复这一天的事件。根据你的预知行事会破坏你的时空影子，直到你完成一次长时间的休息，但允许你使用以下能力之一。",
	"You gain advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.": "你在攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷上获得优势。",
	"You can cause one attack roll that doesn't have advantage to miss you.": "你可以使一个没有优势的攻击卷错过你。",
	"You can act on the knowledge of one thing that you could have known before the end of the day, such as the answer to a riddle, the location of a pit trap, the path through a labyrinth, or someone's name.": "你可以根据你在一天结束前可以知道的一件事采取行动，比如谜语的答案、坑道的位置、通过迷宫的路径，或者某人的名字。",
	"Once you use this ability, all remaining foreknowledge leaves you until you finish a long rest.": "一旦你使用这个能力，所有剩余的预知能力都会离开你，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Gastronomy, the oft-satirized subschool of food-related magic, is rarely taught to wizardly apprentices, for even masters of transmutation can be terrible at cuisine. However, gastronomy is a truly nourishing magic which spans all cultures and is more akin to an art than an arcane tradition. Stereotypical gastronomists are thought of as monstrously fat and held aloft by magic, like great balloons in robes, but this is mostly a myth; wizards of this school are usually healthier than their contemporaries, owing to a healthy and balanced magical diet.": "美食学，这个经常被嘲笑的与食物有关的魔法分支，很少被教给巫师学徒，因为即使是转化大师也可能对美食很糟糕。然而，美食是一种真正有营养的魔法，它跨越了所有的文化，更类似于一种艺术而不是一种神秘的传统。刻板印象中的美食家被认为是畸形的胖子，被魔法高高举起，就像穿着长袍的大气球，但这多半是个神话；这个流派的巫师通常比他们同时代的人更健康，因为有健康和平衡的魔法饮食。",
	"Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with {@item cook's utensils|PHB} and have advantage on any ability check you make to cook or prepare ingredients. Additionally, you can cast the spell {@spell create food and water|PHB} once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell using this feature, the resulting food is a mouthwatering meal of your choosing.": "从你在2级时选择这个流派开始，你获得对（%0%）的熟练度，并在你为烹饪或准备材料而进行的任何能力检查中拥有优势。此外，你可以在不使用法术槽的情况下施放一次{@spell create food and water|PHB}的法术，当你完成长时间的休息时，你会重新获得施法的能力。当你使用此功能施法时，所产生的食物是你选择的令人垂涎的食物。",
	"Also at 2nd level, when you finish a short or long rest, you can prepare a meal using monsters that you and your allies have slain. The meal uses the entire corpse of a creature as an ingredient, which must have died within the last 24 hours or been preserved by a {@spell gentle repose|PHB} spell. You can't use this ability with the corpses of celestials, humanoids, or undead creatures. The meal contains enough food for a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier; this food spoils if not eaten in 24 hours. When a creature partakes of this meal at the end of a short or long rest, it rolls a number of d6s equal to the ingredient creature's challenge rating (1d6 for creatures of CR 1/2 and lower) and gains temporary hit points equal to the total rolled. Additionally, if the ingredient creature had immunity to a damage type other than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can choose for the meal to bestow resistance to one such damage type for 8 hours to any creature that partakes of it.": "同样在2级，当你完成短暂或长时间的休息时，你可以用你和你的盟友所杀的怪物准备一顿饭。这顿饭使用一个生物的整个尸体作为原料，这个生物必须在过去24小时内死亡，或者被一个（%0%）的法术保存起来。你不能对天人、人形生物或不死生物的尸体使用这种能力。这顿饭包含了足够的食物，其数量相当于你的智力修正值；如果在24小时内没有被吃掉，这些食物会变质。当一个生物在短期或长期休息结束时吃了这顿饭，它就会掷出与原料生物的挑战等级相等的d6（CR 1/2和更低的生物为1d6），并获得与掷出的总点数相等的临时命中。此外，如果原料生物对重击、穿刺或砍击伤害以外的伤害类型有免疫力，你可以选择让这顿饭在8小时内赋予任何吃了它的生物对这种伤害类型的抵抗力。",
	"You can only prepare one meal using this ability, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.": "你只能用这种能力准备一顿饭，当你完成长时间的休息后，就能重新获得这种能力。",
	"Beginning at 6th level, you can make other creatures smell delicious! Once per turn, when a creature fails a saving throw against a spell that you cast of 1st level or higher, you can cause the target to smell and taste like delectable food for up to 1 minute or until you use this ability again. This odor carries out to 15 feet and can resemble any food of your choosing, from freshly baked bread to grilling meat. While the target smells this way, attacks made to bite the creature or attack it with teeth have advantage, and the target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration.": "从第6级开始，你可以让其他生物闻到美味的味道 每回合一次，当一个生物对你施放的1级或更高等级的法术的救赎失败时，你可以使目标闻起来像美味的食物，持续1分钟或直到你再次使用这个能力。这种气味可以传到15英尺以外，并且可以类似于你选择的任何食物，从刚出炉的面包到烤肉。当目标以这种方式闻到气味时，咬该生物的攻击或用牙齿攻击该生物有优势，而目标在为保持注意力而进行的宪法拯救上有劣势。",
	"Additionally, creatures of Intelligence 3 or lower can't distinguish the target from the smell and react accordingly. Most creatures can distinguish the target from the odor after dealing damage to it.": "此外，智力为3或更低的生物无法从气味中分辨出目标并做出相应的反应。大多数生物在对目标造成伤害后可以从气味中分辨出来。",
	"At 10th level, you can cast the spell {@spell heroes' feast|PHB} once, creating enough food for one creature, without using a spell slot or material components. At 11th level, you can create enough food for 5 creatures.": "在10级时，你可以施展该法术（%0%）一次，为一个生物创造足够的食物，而无需使用法术槽或材料组件。在11级时，你可以为5个生物创造足够的食物。",
	"Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to summon a Large-sized disembodied mouth of magical force filled with sharp teeth in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. On each of your turns, you can command the mouth to float up to 30 feet (no action required), and you can use your bonus action to command it to bite a creature within 5 feet of it. The mouth uses your spell attack bonus for its melee attack roll, and on a hit, deals {@dice 4d10} force damage and grapples its target (escape DC equals your spell save DC) on a hit. The mouth can grapple only one target at a time, and can only attack the creature it is grappling.": "从14级开始，你可以用你的行动在你能看到的60英尺范围内的无人空间里召唤一个大尺寸的、充满了尖锐牙齿的魔法力量的非实体嘴。在你的每个回合中，你可以命令这张嘴漂浮到30英尺（无需行动），并且你可以使用你的额外行动命令它咬住5英尺内的生物。嘴巴使用你的法术攻击加成进行近战攻击卷，一旦命中，就会造成（%0%）武力伤害，并在命中后抓取目标（逃脱DC等于你的法术救赎DC）。嘴巴一次只能抓取一个目标，并且只能攻击它正在抓取的生物。",
	"If the mouth is grappling a target of Medium size or smaller at the start of your turn, you can use your bonus action to command it to swallow its target, depositing the creature in an extradimensional space filled with acid. While swallowed, the creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, taking {@dice 4d6} acid damage at the beginning of each of its turns. The creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC to escape. On a success, it magically reappears and falls {@condition prone} in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mouth. The creature automatically escapes when the mouth vanishes.": "如果在你的回合开始时，这张嘴正抓着一个中等大小的目标，你可以使用你的额外行动来命令它吞下目标，将该生物放在一个充满酸液的次元空间中。当被吞噬时，该生物是{@condition blinded}和{@condition restrained}，在其每个回合开始时受到{@dice 4d6}的酸液伤害。该生物可以用它的行动对你的法术救赎DC做一个力量救赎来逃跑。如果成功，它就会神奇地重新出现，并落在嘴边5英尺内无人的地方。当嘴巴消失时，该生物会自动逃脱。",
	"The mouth disappears after 1 minute, or if you dismiss it early on your turn (no action required). Once you summon the mouth, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "这张嘴在1分钟后消失，或者如果你在你的回合中提前解散它（不需要行动）。一旦你召唤了这张嘴，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Somnomancers are an idiosyncratic bunch, given to fancies, daydreams, and odd sartorial choices, so it is no surprise that their subschool of magic is rarely accorded any respect by mages of other schools. Although their obsession with sleep is occasionally useful, such as when someone needs to be hypnotized or must have their dreams interpreted, it is more often a source of humor—much to the chagrin of so-called \"pajama mages\"!": "嗜睡者是一群特立独行的人，喜欢幻想、做白日梦和奇怪的服装选择，所以他们的子魔法流派很少受到其他流派法师的尊重，这一点也不奇怪。虽然他们对睡眠的痴迷偶尔会有用处，比如有人需要被催眠或者必须解释他们的梦境，但更多时候是一种幽默的来源--这让所谓的 \"睡衣法师 \"感到很懊恼",
	"Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, your mastery over sleep magic has rendered you a persistent sleep-walker. While you are asleep, you can move around freely; you don't fully perceive your environment while asleep, so you must navigate from memory. Additionally, you can copy spells to your spellbook while asleep.": "从你在2级时选择这个流派开始，你对睡眠魔法的掌握使你成为一个持久的梦游者。在你睡着的时候，你可以自由地走动；在睡着的时候你不能完全感知你的环境，所以你必须根据记忆进行导航。此外，你可以在睡眠时将法术复制到你的法术书中。",
	"Also at 2nd level, you add the {@spell sleep|PHB} spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. Whenever you cast this spell, it is improved in the following ways:": "同样在2级的时候，如果你的法术书中没有这个{@spell sleep|PHB}的法术，你就把它加到你的法术书中。每当你施放这个法术时，它都会在以下方面得到改进。",
	"The total number of hit points that can be affected is equal to double the number rolled on the dice.": "可以影响的总命中率等于骰子上掷出的数字的两倍。",
	"The radius of the spell is increased to 30 feet.": "咒语的半径增加到30英尺。",
	"You can freely choose the order in which creatures are affected by a {@spell sleep|PHB} spell you cast.": "你可以自由选择生物受到你施放的（%0%）法术影响的顺序。",
	"Beginning at 6th level, by performing a repetitive action for 1 minute, you can hypnotize a willing creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you.": "从6级开始，通过执行1分钟的重复动作，你可以催眠60英尺范围内愿意看到和听到你的生物。",
	"While hypnotized by you, it is semi-conscious and {@condition charmed} by you. Other spells and effects that charm the creature or influence its mind have no effect while the creature is hypnotized. If you choose, you can cause a creature to repeat its saving throw against these effects, ending an effect on itself on a success.": "当被你催眠的时候，它是半清醒的，并且（%0%）被你催眠。当生物被催眠时，其他魅惑生物或影响其思想的法术和效果都没有效果。如果你选择，你可以使一个生物重复它对这些效果的蓄力动作，在成功后结束对它的影响。",
	"The creature has the ability to perfectly recall its memories while hypnotized, including memories that have been magically altered or suppressed. While hypnotized, the creature will truthfully answer any question you pose to it.": "该生物有能力在被催眠时完美地回忆起它的记忆，包括被魔法改变或压制的记忆。在被催眠时，该生物会如实回答你向它提出的任何问题。",
	"Lastly, you can specify a single command word to be embedded in the creature's subconscious for up to 24 hours. The first time the creature hears the command word while it is not hypnotized, it immediately performs the single action or repeats a certain phrase that you specified while the creature was hypnotized. The creature performs this action or speaks this phrase even if the effects of a spell would compel them to act otherwise.": "最后，你可以指定一个单一的命令词嵌入生物的潜意识中，时间最长为24小时。当生物在未被催眠时第一次听到这个命令词，它就会立即执行你在生物被催眠时指定的单一行动或重复某句话。即使法术的效果会迫使它们采取其他行动，该生物也会执行这个行动或说出这句话。",
	"The creature remains hypnotized by you for up to 1 hour, or until it takes damage or you end it early by saying a special command word.": "该生物被你催眠的时间长达1小时，或者直到它受到伤害或者你通过说一个特殊的命令词提前结束它。",
	"At 10th level, you add the spell {@spell dream|PHB} to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast this spell, the messenger may jump between up to 12 creatures (each makes their saving throw against the spell separately), conversing with any or all of them. They can only appear monstrous to one of the targets, however, and the spell ends immediately after that option is utilized.": "在10级的时候，如果你的法术书中没有这个法术，你可以把这个法术（%0%）加入你的法术书。当你施展这个法术时，信使可以在最多12个生物之间跳来跳去（每个人都要单独对法术进行蓄力），与他们中的任何一个或所有的人进行对话。然而，他们只能对其中一个目标显示为畸形，并且在使用该选项后，法术立即结束。",
	"When you reach 14th level, you can give creatures that you put to sleep terrible nightmares. At the start of their turn, you can choose to make any creature that is under the influence of a {@spell sleep} spell that you cast take {@dice 3d6} psychic damage. This damage can't wake a creature up, nor can it reduce a creature below 1 hit point.": "当你达到14级时，你可以让被你安眠的生物做可怕的噩梦。在他们的回合开始时，你可以选择让任何受到你施放的{@spell sleep}法术影响的生物受到{@dice 3d6}精神伤害。这种伤害不能唤醒生物，也不能使生物的命中率降低到1点以下。",
	"For all the wrong you have done in your life, the gods have graced you with an undeserved second chance. Your burden is to atone, to undo all the evils you have done in your life, and to seek redemption before the gods. How you accomplish this is your choice, so long as you remove any dark marks you leave behind. Ultimately, your final martyrdom might be a grand act, averting a great disaster or banishing a force of evil, or it might be as humble as redirecting the life of an evil person and causing them to seek redemption, passing the torch to a new martyr of atonement.": "对于你在生活中所做的一切错事，众神给了你一个不应有的第二次机会。你的责任是赎罪，消除你在生活中所做的一切罪恶，并在众神面前寻求救赎。如何实现这一目标是你的选择，只要你能消除你留下的任何黑暗印记。最终，你的最终殉道可能是一个伟大的行为，避免了一场巨大的灾难或驱逐了一股邪恶的力量，也可能是像重新引导一个邪恶的人的生活那样卑微，使他们寻求救赎，将火炬传给新的赎罪殉道者。",
	"You gain burden spells at the martyr levels listed.": "你在所列的殉道者等级中获得负担法术。",
