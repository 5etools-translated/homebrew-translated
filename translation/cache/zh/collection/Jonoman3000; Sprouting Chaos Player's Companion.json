While sunbathing, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep, and you are considered fully nourished for the rest of the day.": "你不需要在阳光下睡觉。相反，你可以选择每天晒太阳4个小时。晒太阳时，你可以做一个时尚的梦；这样的梦实际上是通过多年的练习而成为反射性的精神练习。以这种方式休息后，你获得了与人类8小时睡眠相同的好处，而且你被认为在一天的其余时间里得到了充分的营养。",

	"The Silva do not reproduce like the other races. Instead, they are born from the seed-pods of giant trees, called \"Mother Trees.\" These trees average around 400 to 500 feet in height, with the base of the trunk being about 20-25 feet in diameter. Each Silva city has one or two of these trees, which are always positioned near the center of the city. These trees grow a new Silva once a month, for an average of 12 a year.

They can consume food, but they prefer to get their nourishment from photosynthesis.": "席尔瓦不只是看起来像植物--它们是植物。它们不需要消耗食物来生存，当它们长期没有水和阳光时，就会枯萎。它们可以消耗食物，但它们更喜欢从光合作用中获得营养。",
	"Silva biology is very different from any other race. They do not have internal organs, but instead are formed from growing plant matter, with sap for blood, and leaves and bark for skin. A jaw, for example, can be formed by leaves, vines, or even shards of bark that grow and press together to form the silhouette of a jaw, but if you look closely you can still see the fibers and holes of the structure. Instead of bones, an arm is a mass of tightly-woven stems and leaves that work together to do the work of such a limb.": "Silva的生物学特性与其他种族非常不同。他们没有内部器官，而是由生长中的植物物质形成，以树液为血液，以树叶和树皮为皮肤。例如，下巴可以由树叶、藤蔓，甚至是树皮碎片形成，它们生长并压在一起，形成下巴的轮廓，但如果你仔细观察，还是可以看到结构的纤维和孔洞。胳膊不是骨头，而是一团紧密交织的茎和叶子，它们共同完成这样一个肢体的工作。",

Although they are not necessarily evil, an Awakened Blight is still feared and hunted wherever they go. Most races of the world do not consider awakened blights a race, but instead consider them monstrosities.": "被唤醒的植物被赋予了智慧和行动力的力量，瘟疫困扰着被黑暗污染的土地。\"觉醒者 \"是那些已经上升到更高智慧和力量的菌类。虽然大多数人仍然追随他们的邪恶主人，但如果他们愿意，觉醒的人能够偏离这条道路。虽然他们不一定是邪恶的，但觉醒的瘟疫仍然令人恐惧，无论他们走到哪里都会被追捕。世界上的大多数种族都不认为觉醒者是一个种族，而是认为他们是畸形的。",
	"Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire's evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.": "传说中，有一个叫古尔泰斯的吸血鬼，他施展可怕的魔法，建起了一座名为夜叉尖塔的可憎的塔。当一位英雄用木桩刺穿他的心脏时，古尔泰斯被解救了，但是当这个吸血鬼被消灭时，他的血液给木桩注入了可怕的力量。随着时间的推移，木头上长出了新的卷须，长成了一棵注入了吸血鬼邪恶精华的树苗。据说，一个疯狂的德鲁伊发现了这棵树苗，把它移植到一个可以生长的地下洞穴里。从这棵古尔蒂亚斯树上传来了种子，从那里播下了第一批瘟疫的种子。",
	"Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or power, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption. In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.": "只要一棵树或植物被邪恶的思想或力量的碎片所污染，就会有一棵Gulthias树出现，侵袭和腐蚀周围的森林。它的邪恶通过根部和土壤传播到其他植物上，这些植物就会灭亡或转化为疫病。随着这些枯萎病的蔓延，它们会毒害和拔除健康的植物，用荆棘、有毒的杂草和其他同类植物取代它们。随着时间的推移，枯萎病的侵袭可以将任何土地或森林变成一个腐败的地方。在被疫病侵袭的森林里，树木和植物以超自然的速度生长。藤蔓和矮树丛迅速蔓延，穿过建筑物，覆盖小路和道路。在瘟疫杀死或赶走其居民后，整个村庄可以在几天内消失。",

	"Risen from only the most powerful gulthias trees, a Thorn Giant is the most powerful blighted creature, capable to destroying towns, forests, and jungles in only a matter of weeks. More intelligent than their brethren, Thorn Giants act as the commanders of a swarm of blights, directing where they move and how they attack. When under the watch of a Thorn Giant, blights act far more intelligently, forming formations and employing standard battle tactics. The Thorn Giant knows the language of the giants, and attempts to bring any giants it encounters over to its cause.

The vine terror initially grows and feeds off of a host plant, until the terror becomes large enough to provide for itself.
