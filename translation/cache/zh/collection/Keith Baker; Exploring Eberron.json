	"Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons & Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world—which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.": "Wizards of the Coast在2002年宣布了 \"幻想设定搜索\"：为《龙与地下城》征集一个新的世界。他们收到了数以千计的作品，包括我的世界--它最终成为了Eberron。我与James Wyatt、Bill Slavicsek、Christopher Perkins以及其他许多人合作，将我最初的想法发展成了今天你们所知道的Eberron。",
	"I'm extremely proud of the world we've created. However, there are elements I love that I've never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations—considering the civilizations that the merfolk, sahuagin, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down—or in some cases, cut entirely—in our original {@i Eberron Campaign Setting.} The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn't nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.": "我对我们所创造的世界感到非常自豪。然而，有一些我喜欢的元素，我从来没有机会在正式书籍中探索。在最初设计这个世界时，我把水生国家包括在内--考虑到merfolk、sahuagin和其他智能海底物种可能建立的文明。我们为Eberron开发了一个独特的平面系统，与成熟的大轮盘有着截然不同的风味。我们提出了一个自豪的地精帝国的想法，它在人类到来之前就已经统治了Khorvaire。但是任何资料书的页数都是有限的，这些想法不得不被削减--或者在某些情况下，完全被削减--在我们的原始资料中（%0%）。 这些星球是存在的，但是从来没有足够的空间来描述它们，每个星球超过一段，这还不足以理解费尔尼亚与火元素星球的不同之处，或者你如何在马巴尔设置一个冒险。从正统材料中，我们知道萨瓦金人的存在，并且在斯托姆雷奇有大使，但对他们的文明没有任何透露。",
	"From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a {@i Planes of Eberron} sourcebook, but it never came to pass—and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn't have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I've always had dreams of Droaam and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the {@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron's history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}—the official fifth-edition hardcover—the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn't enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.": "从一开始，我就希望我们能看到一本{@i Planes of Eberron}的资料书，但它从未实现--当Eberron在D&D第四和第五版中回归时，资料书需要优先考虑设定的关键基础，而没有空间去探索这些隐藏的角落。因此，虽然我脑子里一直有Droaam和平面的梦想，但Eberron是海岸奇才的知识产权，只有他们能出版新的Eberron材料。这一切在2018年发生了变化，当时海岸奇才与我合作创作了{@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}，这是一本在地下城主协会网站上发布的PDF补充材料......随着这次发布，他们在Eberron的历史上第一次让任何人通过地下城主协会为Eberron创造新内容成为可能。第二年，在创建{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}--官方的第五版精装本时，设计团队扩展了莫洛矮人的故事。但是再一次，没有足够的空间来关注他们与达尔凯尔的冲突和地下世界的神秘。",
	"That's where Wayne Chang, who works with me on the podcast {@i Manifest Zone}, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I've always wanted to explore—the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations—as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!": "这就是与我一起做播客（%0%）的韦恩-张进入画面的地方。我们一起为这本书制定了一个计划，深入探讨了许多我一直想探讨的话题--飞机、达卡尼和海底国家--以及一些更近期的发展，如Moror。于是，这本书就诞生了。",
	"As it turns out, writing a book of this size is a {@i tremendous} amount of work. Laura Hirsbrunner accomplished herculean tasks as both editor and layout designer, while Will Brolley developed immersive monsters, magic items, archetypes, and more. Since working in a vacuum is a good way to die of asphyxiation, I'm incredibly grateful to Laura, Wayne, and Will for being a constant source of feedback and inspiration.": "事实证明，写一本这么大的书是一个（%0%）的工作量。劳拉-赫斯布鲁纳作为编辑和版面设计师完成了艰巨的任务，而威尔-布罗利则开发了令人沉浸的怪物、魔法物品、原型等等。由于在真空中工作是窒息而死的好方法，我非常感谢劳拉、韦恩和威尔，他们一直是我的反馈和灵感的来源。",
	"We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova's wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens chapter 3, to Marco Bernardini's amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it's been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life. In some instances, to convey a concept to an artist, I put my own limited artistic skills to work. Below is my first draft of a sahuagin city built around one of the slumbering kar'lassa—and in chapter 4, you can see how Vincentius Matthew made sense of my sketch!": "我们还与许多艺术家合作，为这本书开发原创艺术。从卡捷琳娜-波利亚科娃（Katerina Poliakova）为蒂拉-米隆（Tira Miron）所作的精彩画像（该画为第三章的开篇），到马可-贝纳迪尼（Marco Bernardini）令人惊叹的平面图，以及每个平面的微型视图，看到世界的这些未被探索的方面变成现实，令人激动。在某些情况下，为了向艺术家传达一个概念，我把自己有限的艺术技能用于工作。下面是我对一个围绕沉睡的卡拉萨建造的萨瓦金城市的初稿--在第四章中，你可以看到文森提斯-马修是如何理解我的草图的。",
	"I'd be remiss if I didn't also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive—including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis—who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.": "如果我不把Eberron的玩家、管理人和创作者群体也叫出来，那就太失职了，他们都在保持Eberron的活力--包括我们优秀的游戏测试者！当然，还有我聪明的妻子、创作伙伴和Twogether工作室的联合创始人Jennifer Ellis--她总是愿意和我谈论卧底鲨鱼人或和平星球的旅游景点。当然，还有我聪明的妻子、创作伙伴和Twogether工作室的联合创始人Jennifer Ellis--她总是愿意和我聊一聊卧底鲨鱼人或和平位面的旅游景点。",
	"Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You'll find a few details that don't align with previous sourcebooks; it's up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there's always a third option: using {@i your} answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now—when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death—we wanted Eberron to {@i inspire} players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon—and some, you might even ignore. This presents {@i my} Eberron, but I'm always thrilled to see people making the world their own.": "在我把这本书放在你面前之前，有一个免责声明：这是我在我的桌子上运行Eberron的愿景。你会发现一些与以前的资料书不一致的细节；这取决于你决定使用哪些。但请记住，总是有第三个选择：使用（%0%）的答案。从一开始，至今已近二十年了--当我们选择不介绍哀伤的原因或揭示死亡印记的力量时，我们就希望Eberron能够（%1%）玩家和地下城主，而不是限制他们。这是一本供你借鉴的书--有些你甚至可以忽略不计。这本书介绍了{@i my}Eberron，但我总是很高兴看到人们把这个世界变成自己的世界。",
	"And now—Eberron awaits!": "而现在--Eberron在等待着!",
	"\"You think it's safe?\" The crackling arcs of energy wreathing the elemental engine cast a pale blue light across the platform. Dela smiled back at him. \"It's perfectly safe, Rev. Haven't you been on a lightning rail before? What you see there is just a secondary manifestation—\"": "\"你认为这很安全吗？\" 环绕着元素引擎的噼里啪啦的能量弧线在平台上投下淡淡的蓝光。德拉回头对他笑了笑。\"这是完全安全的，牧师，你以前没坐过闪电轨道吗？你在那里看到的只是一个次要的表现--\"",
	"\"Not that.\" The warforged soldier's voice was deep and solemn, like a heavy drum. \"This task. The mountains. The island. The journey into dreams. Rusty says it's impossible.\"": "\"不是这样的。\" 战神士兵的声音低沉而庄重，像一面沉重的鼓。\"这个任务。这座山。这座岛。进入梦境的旅程。拉斯蒂说这是不可能的。\"",
	"\"Just because something's never been done doesn't mean it's impossible. It just means it's a problem I've never tried to solve. But safe? No, it's definitely not safe.\" She reached up, resting her hand on his steel shoulder. \"That's why I'm bringing you.\"": "\"某件事情从未被做过并不意味着它不可能。它只是意味着这是一个我从未试图解决的问题。但是安全吗？不，这绝对不安全。\" 她伸手，把她的手搁在他的钢肩上。\"这就是为什么我把你带来。\"",

	"Eberron is a world shaped by the rise and fall of great ancient civilizations. It's a setting scarred by the impact of the Last War and defined by the ongoing evolution of magic and artifice. What were the weapons of the Last War? How is magic a part of everyday life in the Five Nations? What events of the distant past could play a role in the present day?": "Eberron是一个由伟大的古代文明的兴衰塑造的世界。它是一个被最后一次战争的影响弄得伤痕累累的环境，并被不断进化的魔法和人工制品所定义。最后一次战争的武器是什么？魔法是如何成为五国日常生活的一部分的？遥远的过去有哪些事件会对今天产生影响？",
	"The present is shaped by the past. The shadow of the Last War hangs over Khorvaire, setting the stage for conflicts ahead. But Khorvaire also bears the marks of struggles far more ancient. The goblins in Sharn's slums are descended from the founders of a mighty empire, and they rightfully feel that humanity stole their homeland. The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters. The Church of the Silver Flame was founded at the end of the third century, but it's simply the latest manifestation of a conflict that began at the dawn of time—a battle still fought in the shadows by the fiendish Lords of Dust and the dragons of the Chamber.": "现在是由过去塑造的。最后一次战争的阴影笼罩着霍尔韦尔，为未来的冲突埋下伏笔。但霍尔韦尔也有更古老的斗争的痕迹。沙恩贫民区的地精是一个强大帝国的创始人的后代，他们有理由认为人类偷走了他们的家园。九世纪初对狼人的清洗使人类和变异者之间的关系变得紧张。银色火焰教会成立于第三世纪末，但它只是一场始于时间之初的冲突的最新表现，这场战斗仍然由邪恶的尘埃领主和商会的龙在阴影中进行。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} touches briefly on Eberron's history, but a detailed accounting of the world's hundred-thousand-year recorded history could easily fill an entire book.

	"Before history began, legend holds...": "在历史开始之前，传说中...",
	"The three Progenitor dragons created the planes.": "三条始祖龙创造了这些平面。",
	"In a cosmic quarrel, Khyber destroyed Siberys. Eberron then bound Khyber within her own body, forming the world.": "在一次宇宙争吵中，凯贝尔摧毁了西伯利亚。艾伯伦随后将凯伯捆绑在自己的身体里，形成了这个世界。",
	"No one knows what came before the world's creation. In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation—that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.": "没有人知道在这个世界被创造之前发生了什么。在一些说法中，Xoriat曾经包含了所有的东西；一些 \"下龙 \"的崇拜者断言，daelkyr只是在试图恢复现实的原始平衡。其他人则认为，在创造之前什么都没有--始祖是从更高层次的现实中降生的，也就是位于多鲁尔之上和之外的那个不可知的领域。但几乎所有的文化都同意将现实带入的力量。",
	"Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world.": "三个生命将各个平面编织起来，然后用这些概念作为物质世界的基础。巨人断言这三个生命是某种形式的泰坦，但常见的解释是祖巫的解释：三个巨大的宇宙龙。不管怎么说，这个故事以冲突结束。在完成物质界的创造后，凯伯毫无征兆地出手，将西伯利亚斯撕碎，留下他的残余物在西伯利亚斯的金环中漂流到世界各地。",
	"Knowing she couldn't defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below.": "Eberron知道自己无法战胜Khyber，便将她盘绕起来，成为世界本身，并将Khyber束缚在一个活生生的监狱中，一直保持到今天。因此，我们所知道的世界是由西伯利亚、艾伯伦和凯博尔的交集构成的：上面的龙，中间的龙，下面的龙。",
	"While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don't worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she's the source of all life, but doesn't actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.": "虽然这个故事家喻户晓，但有些传统赋予它更多的意义。在五族中，大多数人认为它是对天空、大地和潜伏在下面的怪物的简单比喻。即使那些认为它是字面意义上的真理的人（如许多德鲁伊），也不会像崇拜主宰者那样崇拜祖先。西伯丽丝已经死了，而Eberron是世界本身；她是所有生命的源头，但并不以任何方式积极干预。然而，少数邪教（特别是在霍尔韦尔的哥布林中）确实直接崇拜始祖。",
	"Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there {@i is} a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest.": "无论是字面上的真相还是隐喻，这些强大的祖先之战都发生在遥远的过去。它对现在的影响最重要的是：有（%0%）个现在。由于这一创造行为带来了万物的存在，霍尔韦尔的学者们还没有找到任何关于这个时间之前的遗迹或记录。如果一个故事涉及到一个来自更深的过去的物体，它很可能拥有巨大的力量，并具有巨大的学术兴趣。",
	"During the Age of Demons, myths tell us...": "在恶魔的时代，神话告诉我们...",

	"Champions, later known as the Sovereign Hosts, fought the overlords with an alliance of dragons and couatl.": "冠军们，后来被称为 \"主宰者\"，与龙和库拉特的联盟一起与霸主作战。",
	"The sacrifice of the couatl bound the overlords with a force that formed the silver Flame.": "库阿特尔的牺牲用一种形成银色火焰的力量束缚了霸主们。",
	"According to the Progenitor myth, Eberron became the world and all natural creatures are her children. But in the first days of the world, the children of Khyber—fiends, aberrations, and other monsters—rose up from the darkness and claimed dominion over the world. The greatest among these were the overlords, immortal archfiends embodying the evils that plague mortals. Each overlord shaped the world to match their whims, and no civilization could challenge them. It was a time of chaos that lasted for untold millennia.": "根据始祖神话，Eberron成为了世界，所有自然生物都是她的孩子。但在世界诞生的最初几天，开伯尔的孩子们--恶魔、畸形人和其他怪物--从黑暗中崛起，并要求统治这个世界。其中最伟大的是霸主，不朽的大恶魔，体现了困扰凡人的邪恶。每个霸主都按照自己的想法来塑造世界，没有任何文明可以挑战他们。那是一个持续了数千年的混乱时期。",
	"The Age of Demons came to an end after an extended war between the overlords and a legendary group of champions—now known as the Sovereign Host. Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods—or perhaps something else entirely—these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn't be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords. Even today, the overlords remain bound and the world protected from immense evil by this force, now known as the Silver Flame.": "恶魔时代在霸主和一群传奇的冠军--现在被称为 \"主宰者\"--之间的长期战争后结束了。这些叛乱者被一些人认为是龙，被另一些人认为是神，或者可能是其他完全不同的东西，他们组建了一支龙的军队，与couatl结盟，据说是体现了Siberys最后的光芒的本地天人。由于不朽的霸主无法被摧毁，无数的库亚特人牺牲了自己，他们的精神结合成一个纯粹的天体能量的监狱，可以约束霸主。即使在今天，这些霸主仍然被束缚着，世界也被这股力量保护着，免遭巨大的邪恶，现在被称为银色火焰。",
	"The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It's commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons—for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It's up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.": "恶魔时代在十万年前结束，远远早于今天任何文明的建立。但这个时代在神话中挥之不去，并继续影响着现代生活。人们普遍认为，主宰的神灵在这一时期行走于世界，并与霸主进行了肉搏战。然而，许多学者断言，这些神话实际上是基于英雄的龙的事迹--例如，主权者奥里昂的神话可能是受一条名叫奥里隆斯特里克斯的龙的事迹启发。真相由DM决定，但冒险者有可能找到与这个时代的主权者有关的地方或遗物。你可能会找到多尔-阿拉赫在与守门人卡塔什卡战斗时使用的长矛，或者她和多尔-多恩为嘲笑者的背叛而剥皮的地方。无论与神还是龙有关，这些遗址和遗迹仍然拥有力量。",
	"While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison... and there's no official list of all of the overlords or where they are bound. So if a story calls for a region where the restless dead rise and prey on the living, this could be the prison of Katashka the Gatekeeper. If a region is suddenly overcome by ice and snow, perhaps the shard-prison of Dral Khatuur has been brought there.": "虽然霸主们可能已经被打败，但他们无法被摧毁。每个霸主都被束缚在开伯尔龙石中，被银色火焰的力量关在监狱里。虽然被束缚，但霸主可以影响其监狱周围地区的世界......而且没有所有霸主的官方名单，也没有他们被束缚的地方。因此，如果一个故事要求一个地区的不安分的死人复活并捕食活人，这可能是守门人卡塔什卡的监狱。如果一个地区突然被冰雪覆盖，也许德拉-卡图尔的碎片监狱就被带到了那里。",
	"Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. As they reach higher levels, adventurers might even become active participants in this struggle instead of mere pawns. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.": "每位霸主只有在 \"龙族预言 \"的某个特定段落实现后才能被释放。被称为 \"尘埃领主 \"的恶魔们致力于发现和实施这些预言，而商会的龙则试图阻止他们。双方都经常利用凡人作为棋子，所以冒险者很容易发现自己被卷入了这些计划。当他们达到更高的水平时，冒险者甚至可能成为这场斗争的积极参与者，而不是单纯的棋子。虽然很少有凡人意识到这一点，但这是一场决定世界命运的持续冷战。",
	"Dungeons from the Age of Demons are rare, few surviving the passage of time. Any remaining sites would be infused with fiendish or celestial power. A vault created by the couatl could hold a deadly artifact tied to an overlord. An obsidian fortress might be imbued with Rak Tulkhesh's power, and people who settle there are consumed by homicidal rage. One of the best documented sites is Ashtakala, an ancient city in the heart of the Demon Wastes said to be the sanctuary of the Lords of Dust.": "恶魔时代的地下城是罕见的，很少有人能在时间的流逝中幸存下来。任何剩余的地点都会被注入恶魔或天体的力量。由库阿特尔创造的金库可能存放着与一个霸主有关的致命的神器。一个黑曜石堡垒可能被注入了拉克-图尔克什的力量，在那里定居的人被杀人的愤怒所吞噬。有记载的最佳地点之一是阿什塔卡拉，这是位于恶魔荒原中心的一座古城，据说是尘土领主的圣地。",

	"In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen'drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons' increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber's power (see chapter 3), the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.": "在恶魔时代之后，龙是Eberron中最强大的力量。一些龙帮助指导较小的生物，包括Xen'drik的巨人，使其掌握奥术。随着龙的统治力不断增强，开伯尔之女的力量激增（见第3章），龙被迫撤退到阿贡尼森的隔离区。他们至今仍留在那里，希望能阻止她的力量进一步增强。",
	"Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen'drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it's thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul'sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it's not known whether the Cul'sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.": "Xen'drik上出现了多个巨人国家。苏拉特联盟擅长元素束缚和魔法培育。他们创造了乌鸦作为活的武器来对付叛乱的精灵，人们认为火巨人是苏拉特的残余。十一国集团是一个由11个城邦组成的联盟，每个城邦都由一个强大的帝王法师领导。他们多样化的文化重视内部和外部的竞争，认为这推动了进化。Cul's Dominion由强大的帝王法师统治，试图主宰所有的现实。他们探索平面和世界；不知道Cul'sir是否攻击了Dal Quor，也不知道当时的Quori是否试图入侵Eberron，但这两个势力打了一场持久战。巨人用灾难性的魔法摧毁了埃伯龙的一颗卫星，破坏了达尔-库尔和世界之间的平面联系，从而结束了这场冲突。从那时起，科里人就无法亲自前往艾伯伦，也不再有任何通往达尔-库尔的显露区。",
	"These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul'sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the elves—both those oppressed by the Cul'sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul'sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen'drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler's Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du'rashka Tul—\"the madness of crowds\"—causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.": "这些行动对巨人文明产生了破坏性的影响。在这场动乱中，许多Cul's sir的臣民利用这个机会进行反抗，但最大的起义是精灵--既包括那些被Cul's sir压迫的精灵，也包括那些从未被巨人征服过的精灵战士。当Cul's sir威胁要再次动用他们最危险的魔法来摧毁精灵时，龙从Argonnessen强势崛起了。他们彻底摧毁了Xen'drik的文明，包括巨人和其他文明，然后对这片土地下了现代人无法理解的诅咒。时至今日，这片土地上的祸害阻止了任何先进文明的再次崛起。旅行者的诅咒扭曲了空间，使Xen'drik的旅行变得不可靠。被称为Du'rashka Tul的诅咒--\"人群的疯狂\"--导致过于先进或广泛的文明崩塌，陷入疯狂。德拉康诅咒被认为是巨人从强大的泰坦演变为山丘巨人和今天已知的其他巨人的原因。这些龙卷风诅咒的全部范围尚不清楚，但其影响是明确无误的。",
	"The curses laid on Xen'drik mean that the entire continent is in essence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped or explored. The giants mastered secrets of arcane magic as yet unmatched by humanity or even by the elves, and as such Xen'drik is a source for powerful artifacts, spells, and eldritch machines. Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to recover a Cul'sir artifact could easily drive an adventure, and Sulat weapons could shift the balance of power in Khorvaire if they fell into the wrong hands.": "对Xen'drik的诅咒意味着整个大陆在本质上是一个巨大的地牢，一个永远无法被完全映射或探索的土地。巨人掌握了人类甚至精灵都无法比拟的奥术秘密，因此Xen'drik是强大的神器、法术和超自然机器的来源。元素飞艇和战争锻造者的发展都是受到与古代巨人有关的发现的启发，而新的发现也可能同样重要。寻找库尔先生神器的竞赛很容易推动一场冒险，而苏拉特武器如果落入坏人之手，就会改变霍尔韦尔的权力平衡。",
	"While Xen'drik's many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn't stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach lies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to be explored.": "虽然Xen'drik的许多诅咒使人们几乎不可能在这片土地上殖民，但这并不妨碍人们的尝试！Stormreach城是一个位于未知边缘的前哨站。暴风城是未知世界边缘的前哨，是强大的神器、未知的魔法和奇异的生物流向霍尔韦尔的门户。在Stormreach之外，是一个充满废墟和奇迹的耐人寻味的大陆，等待人们去探索。",
	"Though the Age of Giants has faded into legend, consider these ideas how your character might encounter its echoes today:": "虽然巨人时代已经消逝在传说中，但考虑这些想法，你的角色今天可能会遇到它的回声。",
	"As an elf, you're haunted by trance-visions of an ancient city of your distant ancestors hidden somewhere in trackless Xen'drik. What is the force that's calling you there?": "作为一个精灵，你被恍惚的幻象所困扰，你遥远的祖先的古城隐藏在无轨的Xen'drik的某个地方。是什么力量在召唤你去那里？",
	"As an artificer, you're on the edge of an arcane breakthrough, but the final piece of the puzzle is tied to the work of the giants. You'll need to search through their ruins for clues.": "作为一名工匠，你正处在一个奥秘突破的边缘，但拼图的最后一块与巨人的工作有关。你需要在他们的废墟中寻找线索。",
	"You possess a trinket from Xen'drik—a prospector's map? an ancient key?—tied to an ancient Sulat vault.": "你拥有一个来自Xen'drik的饰品--一个探矿者的地图？ 一把古老的钥匙？--系在一个古老的Sulat金库上。",

	"Goblins and orcs dominated Khorvaire, while dwarves, dragonborn, gnomes, and halflings had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.": "地精和兽人主宰着霍尔韦尔，而矮人、龙裔、地精和半身人在大陆上的存在和影响较小。",
	"The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan flourished for ten thousand years, then was destroyed when the daelkyr invaded the Material Plane. Thought he daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.": "达卡安的妖精帝国繁荣了一万年，然后在达尔基尔人入侵物质世界时被摧毁。以为达尔基尔被打败了，但他们的疯狂种子摧毁了地精文明。",
	"The daelkyr conflict destroyed the dwarven Realm Below.": "daelkyr冲突摧毁了下面的矮人境界。",
	"After Xen'drik was shattered by the dragons, they remained isolated in Argonnessen. Human civilization was slowly taking shape on Sarlona, but the most dynamic cultures of this period were forming on and around the continent of Khorvaire. The elves founded a new homeland on Aerenal—\"Aeren's rest\" in Elvish—instituting the Undying Court and establishing the cultures that would become the Aereni and the Tairnadal. On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire. The Dhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes—the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with the dragonborn of what's now Q'barra, the dwarves of the Realm Below, and Tairnadal explorers, but none could stop the advance of Dhakaan.": "在Xen'drik被龙击碎后，他们仍然被隔离在Argonnessen。人类文明在萨洛纳慢慢形成，但这一时期最有活力的文化是在霍尔韦尔大陆及其周围形成的。精灵们在艾瑞纳（Aerenal）--埃尔维什语中的 \"艾瑞纳的休息\"--建立了不朽的法庭，并建立了后来成为艾瑞纳和泰尔纳达尔的文化。在霍尔韦尔，地精族崛起，在大约16000年前建立了达卡安帝国。在接下来的一万年里，它扩张到统治了整个霍尔韦尔中部。达卡尼人慢慢地把他们所有的竞争者都赶到了边缘地带--山区、荒野、大路。他们与现在Q'barra的龙裔、下层世界的矮人和Tairnadal探险家发生冲突，但没有人能够阻止达卡尼的前进。",
	"However, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations through portals from Xoriat, the Empire of Dhakaan was shattered—along with the Realm Below, the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves (see chapter 4).": "然而，当戴尔基尔（daelkyr）率领反常者的军队通过Xoriat的传送门时，达卡安帝国被粉碎了--同时被粉碎的还有地下世界，即矮人的巨大地下文明（见第四章）。",
	"Though this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani champions and Gatekeeper druids sealed the daelkyr in Khyber, the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to creating monsters such as dolgaunts and doppelgangers, the daelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness. One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids' shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization (see chapter 4). Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of Khorvaire were ruins and chaos.": "虽然这场激烈的冲突在达卡尼冠军和守门人德鲁伊将戴尔克尔封印在开伯尔时结束了，但造成的伤害是无法弥补的。除了创造出多尔衮和二重身等怪物外，达尔凯尔还释放出更多微妙的诅咒和疯狂的菌种。其中之一侵蚀了与地精族的共同梦想的联系，而这个梦想将达卡尼文明团结在一起（见第4章）。在几代人的时间里，这个古老的帝国崩溃了，陷入了内战。邪教和残忍在地精族中蔓延，很快，霍尔韦尔的表面只剩下了废墟和混乱。",
	"Dhakaani ruins are scattered across Khorvaire. Most major cities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations, and there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have been largely ignored by the human inhabitants. A Dhakaani ruin could be viewed as a simple dungeon, but these are the remnants of a proud civilization; what an adventurer sees merely as a useful magical weapon could be an important cultural relic of the goblins. While the Empire wasn't as advanced as the civilizations of giants that came before, the daashor artificers of Dhakaan—discussed in depth in chapter 4—produced remarkable artifacts and were master weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of adamantine and other exotic alloys.": "达卡尼废墟散布在霍尔韦尔。现代的大多数主要城市都建立在达卡尼人的基础上，在他们下面有一些隧道和战壕，但基本上被人类居民忽视了。达卡尼人的废墟可以被看作是一个简单的地牢，但这些都是一个骄傲的文明的遗迹；一个冒险家仅仅看作是有用的魔法武器的东西，可能是地精的重要文化遗物。虽然帝国并不像之前的巨人文明那样先进，但达卡安的daashor工匠--在第四章中深入讨论过--生产出了非凡的工艺品，并且是对金刚砂和其他异域合金有着卓越理解的武器制造大师。",
	"This is the story that underlies both the rise of Darguun and the recent emergence of the Heirs of Dhakaan. Before the arrival of humanity, goblins and orcs shaped the destiny of the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim that ancient glory.": "这就是达尔古恩的崛起和最近达卡安继承人的出现所依据的故事。在人类到来之前，地精和兽人塑造了这片大陆的命运，有许多人渴望重新获得那份古老的荣耀。",
	"Though it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the daelkyr incursion is still felt across Khorvaire. The cults of the Dragon Below and the Gatekeeper druids are active legacies of this conflict. As described in chapter 4, the Mror dwarves are venturing into the ruined Realm Below and recovering daelkyr symbionts and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed—and scheming—in Khyber, adventurers could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.": "虽然它发生在几千年前，但整个霍尔韦尔仍能感受到戴尔基尔入侵的影响。下面的龙的崇拜和守门人德鲁伊是这场冲突的积极遗留物。正如第四章所描述的，摩尔矮人正在冒险进入破败的下层世界，并恢复了daelkyr共生体和其他遗物。当达尔凯尔人仍然被封印在开伯尔，并且在谋划着什么的时候，冒险者们可能会偶然发现古代的防御工事、有机的达尔凯尔金库，或者这场被遗忘的战争的其他遗迹。",
	"Whether your character is a goblinoid, orc, or a more recent inhabitant of these lands, consider these ways the Age of Monsters might inform your past and your future:": "无论你的角色是哥布林人、兽人，还是这些土地上的新近居民，都要考虑怪物时代可能会影响你的过去和未来的方式。",
	"As a character from the Shadow Marches, you carry an heirloom amulet you've sworn to keep safe. Have you learned that it's part of the wards that bind the daelkyr in Khyber—and that cultists bound to a particular daelkyr will be hunting you, trying to destroy the amulet?": "作为一个来自阴影地带的角色，你带着一个你发誓要保护的传家宝护身符。你是否了解到这是束缚开伯尔的守护神的一部分--被某一特定守护神束缚的邪教徒将追杀你，试图摧毁这枚护身符？",
	"You're obsessed with the early history of Khorvaire and are always searching for leads on ancient Dhakaani ruins and daelkyr relics. Are you a city goblin or Tharashk half-orc searching for your roots? Or just a scholar of another race that's fascinated with the period?": "你对霍尔韦尔的早期历史非常着迷，总是在寻找关于古代达卡尼遗迹和戴尔基尔遗物的线索。你是一个城市地精或塔拉什克半兽人，正在寻找你的根源？或者只是一个对这个时期着迷的其他种族的学者？",
	"As a Dhakaani goblinoid (see chapter 4) you are an advance scout for a Dhakaani {@i kech}. Were you sent to reclaim lost Dhakaani artifacts, or are you studying the people of the surface, identifying weaknesses, and considering if any are worthy allies?": "作为一个达卡尼妖精（见第四章），你是达卡尼人（%0%）的先遣侦察员。你是被派去夺回丢失的达卡尼文物，还是在研究地表的人们，找出他们的弱点，并考虑是否有值得信赖的盟友？",
	"You possess a Dhakaani weapon, claimed by your ancestor and handed down through your family. There is power in the blade, but it only flows through a bearer when they prove worthy... and you haven't. Can you master the blade?

	"Scholars at Morgrave University call the last five thousand years the Age of Humanity, contending that its defining trait is the rise of human civilization and its spread from Sarlona to Khorvaire. The gnome sages of the Library of Korranberg call it the Dragonmarked Age, asserting that the appearance of the dragonmarks and the achievements of the dragonmarked houses are more significant in the grand sweep of history than mere human achievements. Most people dodge this debate by simply referring to it as the modern age.": "莫格雷夫大学的学者们将过去的五千年称为人类时代，认为它的决定性特征是人类文明的崛起及其从萨尔罗纳到科尔维尔的传播。科兰伯格图书馆的地精贤者称其为龙纹时代，断言龙纹的出现和龙纹家族的成就在历史的长河中比单纯的人类成就更为重要。大多数人通过简单地将其称为现代时代来回避这场辩论。",

	"The first aberrant dragonmarks appeared soon after the true dragonmarks. At the time the dragonmarked houses joined together as the Twelve, aberrant marks were spread across the Five Nations. Some members of the Twelve truly saw aberrant marks as abominations; others considered them a convenient scapegoat to unite the houses and strengthen their position. House propaganda and whispering campaigns amplified the perception of aberrant marks as dangerous and uncontrollable. Fear progressed to violence, and in time, to squads of Deneith soldiers, Vadalis trackers, and Medani inquisitors \"protecting communities from the aberrant threat.\"": "第一批反常的龙纹在真正的龙纹之后不久出现。在有龙纹的家族联合起来成为十二家族的时候，反常的龙纹已经遍布五国。十二家族的一些成员真的把异常龙纹视为可憎的东西；其他人则认为它们是一个方便的替罪羊，可以团结各家族并加强其地位。家族的宣传和窃窃私语活动扩大了人们对反常印记的看法，认为它们是危险和不可控制的。恐惧发展为暴力，并在一段时间内发展为由迪尼斯士兵、瓦达利斯追踪者和梅达尼审问者组成的小队，\"保护社区免受反常者的威胁\"。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks of the time were generally more powerful and dangerous than those of today. The Twelve took true stories of innocents harmed by uncontrolled marks and amplified them—superstition and fear did the rest. The title \"War of the Mark\" implies two even sides, but this was more of a purge than a struggle of equals. Toward the end, however, a few aberrant-marked champions rallied others and challenged the houses. The most infamous were Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague, who seized Sharn and declared it a haven for those with aberrant marks. Eventually, the forces of the Twelve laid siege to the city. When Tarkanan and the Lady saw victory was impossible, they unleashed the full power of their marks. Tarkanan's mark gave him power over the earth, and he shattered the towers. The Lady of the Plague called vermin up from the depths and spread vile diseases in the ruins. Both the aberrants sheltering in the city and the armies attacking it perished, and Sharn remained in ruins for centuries before Galifar I finally reclaimed it.": "当时的反常龙印通常比今天的龙印更加强大和危险。十二人组采用了被不受控制的龙印伤害的无辜者的真实故事，并将其放大--其余的都是迷信和恐惧。印记战争 \"的标题意味着双方势均力敌，但这更像是一场清洗，而不是一场平等的斗争。然而，到了最后，一些拥有反常印记的冠军召集了其他人，向各家族发起挑战。最臭名昭著的是哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）和瘟疫女士，他们占领了沙恩，并宣布它是那些拥有反常标记的人的避难所。最终，十二门派的军队围攻了这座城市。当塔卡南和夫人看到胜利是不可能的，他们释放了他们印记的全部力量。塔卡南的印记给了他对大地的力量，他击碎了塔楼。瘟疫女士将害虫从深处召唤出来，在废墟中传播卑鄙的疾病。躲在城市里的异教徒和攻击它的军队都死了，在加利法尔一世最终夺回它之前，沙恩在废墟中停留了几个世纪。",
	"Aberrant marks were almost completely eradicated during the War of the Mark. When they reappeared in later centuries, they were far weaker than Halas Tarkanan's earth-shaking power, but fear and prejudice linger. Over the last century, with no explanation, aberrant marks have begun manifesting with greater frequency and power. The criminal organization known as House Tarkanan has begun organizing and training those with aberrant marks, fearing another purge could lie ahead.": "在印记战争期间，异端印记几乎被完全根除。当它们在后来的几个世纪中重新出现时，它们远远弱于哈拉斯-塔卡南撼动地球的力量，但恐惧和偏见仍然存在。在过去的一个世纪里，在没有任何解释的情况下，反常的印记开始以更高的频率和力量显现出来。被称为塔卡南家族的犯罪组织已经开始组织和训练那些拥有反常印记的人，担心另一场清洗可能就在眼前。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks don't seem to deserve the prejudice leveled against them. They aren't that powerful, and player characters rarely lose control of their marks. But everyone knows that Halas Tarkanan shattered the towers of Sharn, the Lady of the Plague destroyed her village as a child, and the Dreambreaker was a monster who drove people mad as amusement. As a character with an aberrant mark, you bear the burden of centuries of superstition, stories encouraged and exaggerated by the Twelve. And the leaders of House Tarkanan point to the War of the Mark as a possible path the future might take. If you have an aberrant mark, will you join House Tarkanan and prepare to fight the Twelve? Or will you try to change public perception and fight the fears?": "异教徒的龙印似乎并不值得对它们的偏见。它们并不那么强大，而且玩家角色很少会失去对其标记的控制。但是每个人都知道哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）击碎了沙恩的塔楼，瘟疫女士在孩童时期就摧毁了她的村庄，而破梦者是一个把人逼疯的怪物，作为娱乐。作为一个拥有反常印记的角色，你背负着几个世纪以来的迷信，这些故事被十二门徒鼓励和夸大了。而塔卡南家族的领导人则指出，印记战争是未来可能采取的道路。如果你有一个反常的标记，你会加入塔卡南家族并准备与十二门徒作战吗？或者你会尝试改变公众的看法，与恐惧作斗争？",
	"Karrn the Conqueror failed to unite Khorvaire by force, but centuries later, his descendant Galifar Wynarn succeeded through might and clever diplomacy. Galifar didn't just want power—he wanted to build a better world, and on many levels, he succeeded. He abolished slavery and instituted laws that promised justice for all. Over time, the kingdom would promote public education and the rise of the merchant class. It can be argued that Galifar stumbled in giving the dragonmarked houses too much economic power; while the Korth Edicts prevent dragonmarked heirs from holding lands or titles, they also lay the foundation for the near-monopolies the houses hold today.": "征服者卡恩没能用武力统一霍尔韦尔，但几个世纪后，他的后裔加利法尔-维纳恩通过力量和聪明的外交手段获得了成功。加利法尔不仅仅想要权力，他还想建立一个更好的世界，在很多方面他都成功了。他废除了奴隶制，并制定了法律，承诺为所有人提供公正。随着时间的推移，这个王国将促进公共教育和商人阶层的崛起。可以说，加利法尔在给予龙纹家族太多的经济权力方面是失策的；虽然科思法令阻止了龙纹家族的继承人持有土地或头衔，但它们也为龙纹家族今天的近乎垄断奠定了基础。",
	"Galifar can also be faulted for his precarious system of succession. By this tradition, the children of the reigning monarch served as governors of the five provinces, with the eldest governing Cyre. The previous governors served as regents until an heir came of age, at which point they were expected to step aside. This system led to multiple rebellions and attempted secessions over the course of history, the Last War simply the largest and last of them.": "加利法尔也因其不稳定的继承制度而受到指责。根据这一传统，在位君主的子女担任五个省的总督，其中最年长的人负责管理赛尔。前任总督担任摄政者，直到继承人成年，这时他们就应该靠边站。这种制度在历史上导致了多次叛乱和分裂企图，最后一次战争只是其中最大和最后的一次。",
	"A century of brutal war has divided the people of the Five Nations, but they are still united by a host of common laws and customs—the legacy of Galifar. And there are still many who look back to Galifar as a golden age, who would be willing to go to war again for a chance to return to that supposed paradise.": "一个世纪的残酷战争分裂了五国人民，但他们仍然被一系列共同的法律和习俗所团结--加利法尔的遗产。仍有许多人将加利法尔视为黄金时代，他们愿意再次参战，以获得回到那个所谓的天堂的机会。",
	"Many of the institutions that define the nations—the Arcane Congress, the King's Citadel, Rekkenmark Academy—were originally dedicated to the common good of Galifar. Members of the longer-lived races, such as elves and dwarves, likely trained at these institutions, regardless of the nations they serve today.": "许多定义国家的机构--奥术大会、国王城堡、雷肯马克学院--最初都是为了加利法尔的共同利益。寿命较长的种族的成员，如精灵和矮人，很可能在这些机构中接受过训练，无论他们今天服务于哪个国家。",
	"Before the ninth century, lycanthropy was largely just a fearsome legend. Lycanthropes were known in the wilds of Khorvaire, but few people had ever seen one; most commoners thought lycanthropes and shifters were the same thing. Early in the ninth century, something changed—the curse of lycanthropy became more virulent, and its victims were driven to ever more extreme behavior. Werewolf attacks and wererat infestations became an increasing problem in western Aundair, and by 830 YK, some feared that an apocalyptic threat was brewing in the Towering Wood—that any day a horde of lycanthropes could sweep across the land and destroy all civilization.": "在第九世纪之前，狼人症基本上只是一个可怕的传说。狼人在Khorvaire的荒野中是众所周知的，但很少有人见过；大多数平民认为狼人和变身者是一回事。在第九世纪初，一些事情发生了变化--狼人的诅咒变得更加剧烈，它的受害者被驱赶到更加极端的行为。狼人的攻击和狼人的侵扰在昂代尔西部成为一个日益严重的问题，到公元830年，一些人担心在高耸的森林中正在酝酿一个世界末日的威胁--任何一天，狼人的部落都可能横扫这片土地并摧毁所有文明。",
	"In 832 YK, Keeper of the Flame Jolan Sol declared that lycanthropy corrupted the soul itself and must be completely eliminated. An army of templars was dispatched to Aundair, and servants of the Flame across Khorvaire were ordered to be vigilant and root out lycanthropes in hiding. And so they did.": "在公元832年，火焰守护者乔兰-索尔宣布，狼人症会腐蚀灵魂本身，必须彻底消除。一支圣殿骑士的军队被派往昂代尔，火焰的仆人们被命令在整个霍尔韦尔保持警惕，铲除隐藏的狼人。他们就这样做了。",
	"The Silver Crusade lasted for nearly fifty years. The first two decades were a brutal, bloody campaign. The lycanthropes were massing in great numbers on the edge of the Towering Wood (now part of the Eldeen Reaches), driven by some unknown evil; most sages believe it was an overlord on the verge of breaking its bonds. The templars were outmatched. The lycanthropes were cunning and could quickly replenish their numbers, and they intentionally stirred up conflict between templars and shifters. But after decades of bitter conflict, the tide slowly turned in favor of the templars. And somehow, the power of the curse was broken. Lycanthropy continued, but its effects weren't as strong, its victims not so driven to darkness.": "白银十字军持续了近五十年。前20年是一场残酷、血腥的运动。狼人在塔林的边缘（现在是Eldeen Reaches的一部分）大量集结，被一些未知的邪恶所驱使；大多数圣人认为那是一个即将打破束缚的霸主。圣殿骑士们不敌对手。狼人很狡猾，可以迅速补充他们的数量，他们故意挑起圣殿骑士和变身者之间的冲突。但经过几十年的激烈冲突，潮流慢慢转向对圣殿骑士有利。而且不知何故，诅咒的力量被打破了。狼人症继续存在，但它的影响没有那么强烈，它的受害者也没有那么被驱赶到黑暗中。",
	"While the true threat was dealt with, the peasants of Aundair had suffered through decades of terror and sought a greater revenge. The next thirty years saw an ongoing inquisition as zealous converts to the faith—later classified as an extremist sect, the Pure Flame—sought to hunt down every remaining lycanthrope. In the process, many innocents—including a great many shifters—were tortured and slain. So the Silver Crusade began as a selfless act that may well have saved Galifar, but ended up as an outlet for paranoia and hatred.": "虽然真正的威胁被解决了，但昂代尔的农民们经历了几十年的恐怖，并寻求更大的报复。在接下来的30年里，由于狂热的信仰皈依者--后来被归类为极端主义教派 \"纯正火焰\"--试图追捕所有剩余的狼人。在这个过程中，许多无辜的人--包括许多移居者--被折磨和杀戮。因此，银色十字军开始时是一种无私的行为，很可能拯救了加里法尔，但最后却成为一种偏执和仇恨的发泄。",
	"The Silver Crusade is a classic example of a virtuous act with bloody consequences. It highlights that the goals of the Silver Flame are to protect the innocent, but fear, greed, and anger can lead reasonable people astray. It's the origin of the Pure Flame, an extremist sect whose narrow vision of the Flame is as a ruthless weapon with which to burn evildoers. It has created a deep rift between shifters and followers of the Silver Flame, and hurt the reputation of shifters everywhere.": "银色十字军是一个典型的例子，说明了一个具有血腥后果的美德行为。它强调了银色火焰的目标是保护无辜者，但恐惧、贪婪和愤怒会使有理智的人误入歧途。这是 \"纯洁之火 \"的起源，这是一个极端主义教派，他们对 \"纯洁之火 \"的狭隘看法是将其作为一种无情的武器来烧死恶人。它在移居者和银色火焰的追随者之间造成了深刻的裂痕，并伤害了各地移居者的声誉。",
	"In the wake of the Silver Crusade, lycanthropy is considered to be a serious public health risk. Templars deal with any confirmed lycanthropes—when possible, they seek to apprehend and cure them, but lethal force is always an option. Lycanthropes can find a safe haven in Droaam (especially with the Dark Pack), and there are still a few scattered ‘thropes in Stormreach, Q'barra, Darguun, and other frontier nations.": "在白银十字军东征之后，狼人症被认为是一种严重的公共健康风险。圣殿骑士处理任何确认的狼人，在可能的情况下，他们寻求逮捕并治愈他们，但致命的武力总是一种选择。狼人可以在Droaam找到一个安全的避难所（特别是与黑暗族群一起），在Stormreach、Q'barra、Darguun和其他边境国家仍有一些零星的狼人。",
	"If you're playing a follower of the Silver Flame or a shifter, think about your view of the Silver Crusade. Likewise, if you're from Aundair or the Eldeen Reaches, consider if your family suffered during the lycanthropic terror.": "如果你扮演的是银色火焰的追随者或变身者，请考虑一下你对银色十字军的看法。同样地，如果你来自Aundair或Eldeen Reaches，请考虑你的家庭是否在狼人的恐怖中遭受了伤害。",

In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows—the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future.

	"The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King's Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together—the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the {@item everbright lantern|ERLW}, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece—a city of wonders—this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.": "加利法尔各省在很大程度上保留了它们曾经的国家的文化和传统。在许多方面，他们的差异得到了加强和颂扬。每个国家都有一个联合王国的支柱：昂代尔的奥术大会、布雷兰的国王城堡、卡尔纳特的雷肯马克学院、瑟兰的大神庙。赛尔是个例外。赛尔没有建立在梅特罗尔现有的文化上，而是从整个加利法尔吸引了专家和工匠。赛尔不是任何一个学科的中心，而是所有这些东西聚集在一起的枢纽--加利法尔可能是最好的。当奥术大会完善了{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}的时候，梅特罗尔是第一个街道被它们照亮的城市。士兵们在Rekkenmark训练，但最优秀的战士在Vermishard卫队服役。虽然梅特罗尔是展示品--一个充满奇迹的城市，但这一原则被应用于整个赛尔中部。通过教育、艺术、甚至农业，赛尔城展示了加利法尔能够完成的最好的东西。",
	"This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever.

	"Cyre's artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith's greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It's said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There's no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create,\" but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.": "赛尔的艺术气质（有人会说是异想天开）被坎尼斯家族的存在所平衡和维持，坎尼斯家族的总部设在伟大的制造之城。许多Cannith家族最伟大的锻造厂遍布赛尔城，为支持赛尔城的奇迹提供了一个实用的工业基础。而这些奇迹有很多形式。昂代尔的奥术大会专注于魔法的实际应用，而赛尔的维纳恩学院则探索奥术的艺术潜力。梅特罗尔是一座充满光明和奇迹的城市。游客可以与过去的英雄和国王的幻象对话，或者观看历史时刻的重演。据说，在梅特罗尔没有人挨饿，也没有人感受到冬天的叮咬。赛尔人说，这反映了赛尔人的慷慨和无私的精神；批评者指出，这些社会项目之所以能够实现，是因为其他省份的人民缴纳了税收。当然，赛尔掌握着加利法尔的财富，其生活水平高于其他任何省份。这是颓废吗？还是它是一个正在进行的工作，一个有朝一日可以应用于所有国家的模式？我们无从得知。居里人哀悼失去的东西；其他国家的人民批评居里人的生活方式是寄生的。\"我们的梦想是什么，我们的手就创造什么。\"但痛苦的局外人指出，虽然居里人的手可能已经建造，但他们使用的是别人辛勤工作收集的资源。",
	"This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar's traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch's children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.": "加利法尔的继承传统进一步助长了这种怨恨。以加利法尔一世为例，君主的子女担任五个省的总督。最年长的人管理赛尔，在君主去世后，他们将继承王位，他们的子女将接管各省的管理职位。之前的总督将作为摄政者，直到孩子们成年，之后则作为顾问。当一个君主没有五个孩子时，以前的总督将保留这些职位。但这个原则很简单。赛尔是加利法尔的心脏，其他一切都将围绕它进行。",
	"Galifar's goal with Cyre was to create something new, a culture combining the best aspects of the other nations. In the newly forged Thrane, Aundair, and Breland, the people kept their old traditions, and ruling families were often incorporated into the new governing structure; similarly, Galifar preserved the customs of his homeland of Karrnath. But in the old kingdom of Metrol—which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland—the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre's dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.": "加利法尔与赛尔的目标是创造新的东西，一种结合了其他国家的最佳方面的文化。在新成立的瑟兰（Thrane）、昂代尔（Aundair）和布雷兰（Breland），人们保留了他们的旧传统，统治家族往往被纳入新的管理结构中；同样，加利法尔也保留了他的家乡卡尔纳特（Karrnath）的习俗。但在旧的梅特罗尔王国--它的面积和形状大致相当于现代的哀牢地--旧的制度和统治者被推到一边，为赛尔的梦想腾出空间。梅特罗尔的一些贵族家庭接受了这条新路。其他人则被加利法尔重新安置，被授予对以前作为独立边界存在的地区的权力。",

There were ongoing clashes with goblins, a few severe, but the Ghaal'dar goblinoid clans largely remained in the mountains and dark places until the Last War.": "覆盖了现在的Darguun。在加里法尔建立时，它基本上没有得到解决，一直是王国阴影下的一个落后地区。它的人民最终繁荣起来，并以他们作为锡兰人的身份为荣，模仿中央王国的习俗。然而，他们几乎没有投资于北方的财富或随之而来的奇迹。与哥布林的冲突不断，有几次很严重，但Ghaal'dar的哥布林氏族基本上都留在了山区和黑暗的地方，直到最后一次战争。",
	"—now Valenar—was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar's greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it's because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called \"thrones\"), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime.": "-现在的瓦伦纳（Valenar）实际上是一个独立的国家，有着截然不同的文化和价值观。这可以说是加利法尔最失败的地方。该地区最初是由来自萨尔罗纳西部的库南地区的移民定居的。加利法尔一世想要旧梅特罗尔的土地，所以他把东赛尔的权力交给了其贵族，让他们成为库南定居者的封建领主。刀锋沙漠是物理和文化上的分界线，在授予贵族们土地后，加利法尔基本上没有理会他们。因此，贵族家庭坚持梅特罗尔的旧传统，而不是接受赛尔的新文化。许多人小气而骄傲，对这种安排不满意，并残忍地把气撒在他们的库南臣民身上。有些人想知道为什么精灵们夺取瓦伦纳的控制权如此简单；首先是因为库南人对他们的赛尔统治者（一般称为 \"王位\"）没有爱，许多人觉得他们在新政权下其实过得更好。",

Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre—expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with House Orien to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.": "在雅罗特国王的统治下，赛尔城继续发光发热。有抱负的艺术家和年轻的贵族们纷纷来到王国的中心，而最有前途的工匠们则在制造之城定居。贾罗特国王对赛尔城给予了极大的关注--扩大了弗米沙德宫，与奥瑞恩家族合作扩大了赛尔城的闪电轨道，并在威纳恩艺术学院和圣主大教堂上花费了数十万加里法。",
	"Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre's finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a paladin, Karrnath is a fighter, Aundair is a wizard, and Breland is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard—elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.": "贾罗特死后，加利法尔王国向战争螺旋式上升。起初，赛伦人的士气很高。米珊女王背后有几个世纪的传统。每个人都知道赛尔拥有最好的东西：最好的巫师，最好的士兵，最重要的工匠。从某种程度上说，这是真的，但当与卡尔纳特或瑟兰的武术文化相比，一支由杰出士兵组成的部队意义不大。赛尔最优秀的巫师是艺术家和理论学者，而昂代尔则长期致力于将魔法作为战争的工具。而专家级的工匠们在很大程度上与坎尼斯家族联系在一起，后者在战争中保持中立。如果把各国视为角色，瑟兰是圣骑士，卡尔纳特是战士，昂代尔是巫师，布雷兰德是流氓。在这个党派中，赛尔是酒吧--优雅、聪明，什么都会做一点......但在与他人合作时最好，不准备单独对抗强大的敌人。",
	"Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar's treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be—and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King's Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre's new military academy. But it was clear that the Cyran dream had been sustained by many hands, and now the nation had to learn to stand on its own.": "赛尔适应了；它必须这样做。起初，它严重依赖雇佣兵，因为它是加利法尔的国库所在地，有多余的黄金。但随着时间的推移和冲突范围的明确，赛尔人投身于战争。赛尔缺乏卡尔纳特或瑟兰的尚武精神，但它的人民因绝对相信他们是正确的而得到支持。除此之外，在人们的眼中，赛尔就是加利法尔。它体现了王国的理想，它可能成为的最好的东西--而这是值得为之奋斗的东西。尽管如此，这场斗争对赛尔人的心理造成了巨大的打击。几个世纪以来，赛尔人一直将自己视为表演的明星，受到所有人的爱戴；现在所有的人都在反对他们，至少有些人可以将他们以前的信仰视为傲慢和自恋。赛尔确实拥有最好的东西，但这是因为它是免费提供的。现在，奥术大会将其知识纯粹用于Aundair的利益，Rekkenmark只训练Karrns，而国王的城堡则为Breland服务。是的，赛尔有所有这些东西的回声。它的巫师仍然是除昂代尔之外的任何国家的对手，而弗米沙德卫队构成了赛尔新军事学院的核心。但很明显，赛尔的梦想是由许多人支持的，现在这个国家必须学会自立。",
	"For a millennium since its founding, Cyran culture blended the traditions of other nations. However, the Last War built walls between Cyre and the other nations, and each evolved in this century of relative isolation. Cyrans know the old add-a-verse songs beloved by Aundairians, but few know the {@i Epic of Valiant and Vigilant}, a tale of martial bravery close to the heart of every modern Aundairian. Nor do they know the maxims of Beggar Dane that now serve as a cornerstone of Brelish culture.": "在建国后的一千年里，赛尔文化融合了其他国家的传统。然而，最后的战争在赛尔和其他国家之间筑起了围墙，在这个相对孤立的世纪里，每个国家都在不断发展。赛尔人知道昂代尔人所喜爱的古老的加词歌曲，但很少有人知道{@i Epic of Valiant and Vigilant}，这是一个与每个现代昂代尔人心心相印的武勇故事。他们也不知道乞丐丹恩的格言，这些格言现在是布莱里什文化的一个基石。",
	"Even so, Cyrans see their culture as being founded on the best principles of Galifar, and can still find some common ground with people of any nation. A Cyran can play Conqueror with a Karrn, sing an add-a-verse song with an Aundairian, and debate religion with a Thrane. This reflects the founding principles of Cyre—to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there's no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there's always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera—a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it's a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they're constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation—that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better. But the Cyrans themselves assert that this approach is rooted in love, not arrogance, and call it the \"Cyran appreciation.\"": "即便如此，赛伦人认为他们的文化是建立在加利法尔的最佳原则之上的，并且仍然可以与任何国家的人找到一些共同点。赛尔人可以和卡恩人一起玩征服者游戏，和昂代尔人一起唱一首加冕歌曲，和瑟兰人一起辩论宗教。这反映了赛尔的创始原则--收集加利法尔最好的方面并在此基础上发展。赛尔人相信没有一条完美的道路；多样性是力量的源泉，但总是有改进的空间。因此，Cyran文化是一个奇怪的混合体--来自整个Khorvaire的熟悉元素与稳定、持续的进化相结合。西兰音乐家可能会用瑟兰人的虔诚风格演奏卡尔纳提人的葬礼哀歌；这是一个拼图，其中的碎片是已知的，但它们不断以新的方式被排列。其他国家的一些公民认为这是盗用--锡兰人是腐肉爬行者，他们偷窃别人的东西，却傲慢地认为自己能做得更好。但居里人自己断言，这种做法是源于爱，而不是傲慢，并称其为 \"居里人的欣赏\"。",
	"In playing a Cyran, you can find familiar things anywhere you go. But what do you treasure in your memories of Cyre? Do you cling to the past, or do you embrace the Cyran principle of always striving to find a new and better way?": "在扮演赛尔号的过程中，你走到哪里都能找到熟悉的东西。但在你对赛尔的记忆中，你珍惜什么呢？你是紧紧抓住过去，还是接受赛尔号的原则，一直努力寻找一种新的更好的方式？",
	"Cyran fashion blends practicality with endless diversity. Cyran clothing begins with a simple foundation—this base layer may be colorful, but it's first and foremost practical and durable. Whether breeches, skirts, shirts, or gowns, a Cyran starts with whatever the wearer finds most comfortable. Again, this base level is well made, but it's more functional than decorative.": "Cyran时尚融合了实用性和无尽的多样性。Cyran服装从一个简单的基础开始--这个基础层可能是彩色的，但它首先是实用和耐用的。无论是马裤、裙子、衬衫还是长袍，Cyran人从佩戴者认为最舒适的东西开始。同样，这个基础层做得很好，但它的功能性大于装饰性。",
	"After starting with simplicity, the Cyran adds flair. Cloaks and gloves are both integral parts of Cyran fashion. Gloves can be short and sturdy for work or war, or long and decorative for more formal occasions. Cloaks likewise vary between the practical and decorative: a heavy cloak for traveling, a short cape for casual socializing, and a long, light cloak with a {@item glamerweave|ERLW} lining for an evening at the Grand Stage. In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion. Often made from copper, leather, wood, or glass, Cyran jewelry is not a display of wealth, but rather a way to express individuality. Feathers and bells are also common accessories; there is a Cyran dance that involves belled bracelets and anklets. Finally, masks are often worn at formal or festive occasions. Cyran masks aren't intended to conceal identity or intent; rather, they are a way of enhancing identity and expressing a mood.": "从简单开始后，Cyran人增加了炫耀。斗篷和手套都是赛兰人时装的组成部分。手套可以是用于工作或战争的短而结实的，也可以是用于更正式场合的长而装饰性的。斗篷也同样在实用性和装饰性之间变化：厚重的斗篷用于旅行，短斗篷用于休闲社交，而长而轻的斗篷带有{@item glamerweave|ERLW}衬里，用于大舞台的夜晚。除了手套、靴子和斗篷等服装外，珠宝和其他配件也是锡兰时尚的重要组成部分。通常由铜、皮革、木头或玻璃制成，居里安人的珠宝不是财富的展示，而是表达个性的一种方式。羽毛和铃铛也是常见的配饰；有一种居里安人的舞蹈涉及到带铃铛的手链和脚链。最后，面具经常在正式或节日的场合佩戴。居里安人的面具并不是为了掩盖身份或意图；相反，它们是增强身份和表达心情的一种方式。",
	"Traditionally, Cyran fashion is filled with color (often accentuated with {@item glamerweave|ERLW}). In the wake of the Last War, many Cyrans have adopted Mourningwear—clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black. Others celebrate their nation by preserving its styles. Because of the emphasis on durability, your Cyran character may still have the clothes they were wearing on the Day of Mourning. What was that outfit, and do you still wear it? Do you favor a mask, and if so, what is its design?": "传统上，居里夫人的时装充满了色彩（通常用（%0%）来强调）。在最后一次战争之后，许多锡兰人采用了丧服--按锡兰风格剪裁的衣服，但完全是黑色的。其他人则通过保留其风格来庆祝他们的国家。由于强调耐用性，你的赛伦人角色可能还保留着他们在哀悼日所穿的衣服。那件衣服是什么，你还穿吗？你是否偏爱面具，如果是的话，它的设计是什么？",
	"Cyran cuisine reflects the Cyran principles of working with the best of all traditions while continuing to explore. In many ways, this is similar to the Sharn fusion found in the City of Towers, and a number of Cyran refugees are rising stars in Sharn's culinary scene. Cyrans blend the thrakel spices of Thrane with traditional Karrn stews, and add the heat of southern Breland to the delicate pastries of Aundair. While many refugees cling to family recipes as a way to remember the fallen nation, others continue the tradition of Cyran appreciation—adopting new favorites from the place they've found shelter and looking for ways to improve them.": "西兰美食反映了西兰的原则，即在继续探索的同时，与所有传统中的精华合作。在许多方面，这类似于在塔城发现的沙恩融合，一些赛兰难民是沙恩烹饪界的新星。西兰人将瑟兰的香料与传统的卡恩炖菜相融合，并将南部布雷兰的热度加入到昂代尔的精致糕点中。许多难民坚持使用家族食谱，以此来缅怀逝去的国家，而其他难民则继续保持着欣赏锡兰人的传统--从他们找到庇护所的地方采用新的最爱，并寻找改进它们的方法。",
	"Traditionally, Cyrans viewed arcane magic as an art form as well as a practical tool. This lent itself to a wider study of illusion and enchantment than found in other nations. But it's also about the presentation of magic, regardless of its school. Whether magewright, bard, or wizard, Cyrans often put more show into the performance of magic than even the Aundairians. For a wizard who's studied at the Wynarn Institute, somatic components are almost a dance, while verbal components have the cadence of song or poetry. This echoes the Cyran love of flowing capes and cloaks. As a Cyran spellcaster, you are truly a student of arcane arts; consider how your casting reflects this.": "传统上，锡兰人将神秘的魔法视为一种艺术形式以及一种实用工具。这使其对幻觉和魔法的研究比其他国家更广泛。但这也是关于魔法的展示，无论其流派如何。无论是魔法师、吟游诗人还是巫师，锡兰人在表演魔法时往往比昂代尔人更注重表演。对于一个在维纳恩学院学习过的巫师来说，身体的部分几乎是一种舞蹈，而语言的部分则有歌曲或诗歌的韵律。这与锡兰人对飘逸的披风和斗篷的喜爱相呼应。作为一个居里夫人的施法者，你是真正的奥术学生；考虑你的施法如何反映这一点。",
	"The Silver Flame had some devoted followers and temples in central Cyre, though the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith. However, religion is driven by faith and tradition, and Cyrans have always been encouraged to question and search for new paths. Outer Cyre is a different story. The nobles of Eastern Cyre were and are devout Vassals, convinced they have a divine right to leadership. The people of Southern Cyre are less arrogant, but most hold to a quiet, steadfast faith in the Sovereigns.": "银色火焰在赛尔中部有一些忠实的追随者和庙宇，尽管主权主神是主导性的信仰。然而，宗教是由信仰和传统驱动的，赛尔人一直被鼓励去质疑和寻找新的道路。外赛尔是一个不同的故事。东赛尔的贵族过去和现在都是虔诚的Vassals，坚信他们有神圣的领导权。南部赛尔的人民没有那么傲慢，但大多数人对君主抱有安静、坚定的信仰。",
	"The war drove some Cyrans to embrace their faith more tightly, but for others it was another source of doubt. Likewise, the Mourning threw many devout Cyrans into a crisis of faith, while for others, it actually strengthened it. A devout follower of the Silver Flame doesn't question the cause of the Mourning, they simply seek to protect the innocent from harm. Vassals of the Sovereign Host trust that there is a purpose to their suffering. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Mourning, some Cyrans have turned to the Blood of Vol or cults of the Dragon Below, cursing the gods they once worshiped or following a darker vision. There are also a number of new strains of the old faiths, Cyran twists on the Flame and the Host that seek to adapt traditions to make sense of the war and the world.": "战争促使一些居里人更紧密地拥抱他们的信仰，但对其他人来说，它是另一个怀疑的来源。同样地，哀悼使许多虔诚的赛伦人陷入了信仰危机，而对其他人来说，它实际上加强了信仰。银色火焰的虔诚追随者并不质疑哀悼的原因，他们只是寻求保护无辜者免受伤害。主宰者的附庸相信他们的痛苦是有目的的。同时，在哀悼之后，一些赛兰人转向沃尔之血或龙下的邪教，诅咒他们曾经崇拜的神灵或追随更黑暗的愿景。也有一些旧信仰的新变种，赛兰人对火焰和主人的扭曲，试图调整传统以了解战争和世界的意义。",
	"In playing a Cyran, whether a divine caster or other religious character, consider the impact the Mourning had on your faith. Are you conflicted and struggling to hold to your beliefs? Or was the Mourning a source of inspiration—you know you have a divine purpose, that your people need you? If you're tied to an existing faith, do you follow the standard traditions or have you found an unusual path?": "在扮演Cyran时，无论是神圣的施法者还是其他宗教角色，都要考虑哀悼对你的信仰产生的影响。你是在矛盾中挣扎着坚持自己的信仰？或者说，丧礼是灵感的来源--你知道你有一个神圣的目的，你的人民需要你？如果你与现有的信仰相联系，你是遵循标准的传统，还是找到了一条不寻常的道路？",
	"When most people say \"Cyre,\" they're thinking of central Cyre. When they speak of Cyran refugees, they are referring to the people who fled the Mourning. But there were Cyran refugees long before the end of the war. The Tairnadal elves established the eastern kingdom of Valenar in 956 YK, while Lhesh Haruuc claimed Southern Cyre as Darguun in 969 YK. While Valenar was an unpleasant surprise, it had relatively little impact on the nation. Eastern Cyre had always been isolated, and the Khunan majority embraced elf rule; the refugees were thus a handful of nobles who were painfully out of touch with the traditions of the central kingdom. The loss of Darguun was a more significant blow; Southern Cyre was a backwater, but this was still close to home, and it resulted in a flood of refugees that the war-torn nation was ill-prepared to handle. In creating a Cyran character, consider which Cyre you're from.": "当大多数人说 \"赛尔 \"时，他们想到的是赛尔中部。当他们说到Cyran难民时，他们指的是逃离哀牢的人。但早在战争结束前就有赛尔族难民了。泰尔纳达尔精灵在956 YK年建立了东部的瓦勒纳王国，而Lhesh Haruuc在969 YK年宣称南赛尔为达尔古恩。虽然瓦勒纳是一个令人不快的惊喜，但它对国家的影响相对较小。东赛尔一直与世隔绝，库南人多数接受精灵统治；因此难民是少数贵族，他们与中央王国的传统痛苦地脱节。达尔古恩的丢失是一个更重大的打击；南赛尔是一个落后的地方，但这仍然离家很近，它导致了难民的涌入，这个饱受战争蹂躏的国家没有做好准备来处理。在创建Cyran角色时，要考虑你来自哪个Cyre。",
	"If you're from central Cyre, odds are good that you think of your home as the \"true\" Cyre. Before the Mourning, did you give much thought to the refugees of Valenar and Darguun? Even now, do you think of them when you think of your homeland? Are you devoted to the idea of rebuilding your nation and clinging to your memories and traditions? Or following the Cyran appreciation, are you instead looking forward and trying to find a new and better path, even if that means abandoning the dreams of Cyre?": "如果你来自赛尔中部，你很有可能认为你的家是 \"真正的 \"赛尔。在哀悼之前，你是否考虑过瓦勒纳和达尔古恩的难民？即使是现在，当你想到你的祖国时，你会想到他们吗？你是否致力于重建你的国家，并紧紧抓住你的记忆和传统？还是遵循赛伦的赞赏，你反而向前看，试图找到一条新的、更好的道路，即使这意味着放弃赛尔的梦想？",
	"As an Eastern Cyran, you're tied to a noble family with roots in old Metrol, before Galifar even existed. You don't accept any of the nonsense about Cyre being \"the best of Galifar\" or challenging tradition; if people had stuck to the old ways, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Your people were devoted to the Sovereign Host and truly believed that Aureon had chosen you to rule. At the same time, your lands have been lost for over forty years, and the people of central Cyre have never avenged you or shown your family the respect you deserve. You're not as affected by the Mourning as some, because it wasn't your Cyre that was destroyed—now the others just get to see how you feel. While your character has noble ancestry, you're unlikely to choose the noble background, as nobody would care about such claims. Do you despise the Valenar and hope to reclaim your long-lost homeland? Or do you want to rally Cyran survivors around the {@i true} royal bloodlines, challenging Oargev and reestablishing the long-forgotten kingdom of Metrol?": "作为东锡兰人，你与一个贵族家庭联系在一起，根植于古老的梅托尔，甚至在加利法尔存在之前。你不接受任何关于赛尔是 \"加利法尔最好的 \"或挑战传统的废话；如果人们坚持旧有的方式，也许这一切都可以避免了。你们的人民忠于主宰者，真正相信奥里昂选择了你们来统治。同时，你的土地已经失去了四十多年，赛尔中部的人们从未为你报过仇，也没有对你的家人表示应有的尊重。你不像有些人那样受到哀悼的影响，因为被摧毁的不是你的赛尔城--现在其他人只是看到了你的感受。虽然你的角色有贵族血统，但你不太可能选择贵族背景，因为没有人会关心这种说法。你是否鄙视瓦伦纳人并希望夺回你失散多年的家园？或者你想把Cyran的幸存者团结在{@i true}王室血统周围，挑战Oargev，重建被遗忘已久的Metrol王国？",
	"Your people have been struggling for decades in Southern Cyre, eking out a life in camps and shelters. You were encouraged to take up military service—it was easier to send you to the front than to find a new home for you.

Were you an optimistic idealist? Or were you bitter and angry at the nation that failed to protect you? Are you loyal to Cyre, or are you solely concerned with Darguun and taking vengeance on the goblins?": "你们的人民在南赛尔挣扎了几十年，在难民营和收容所里勉强度日。你们被鼓励去服兵役--把你们送到前线比给你们找一个新家更容易。你的许多朋友和家人都选择崇拜丹妮尔女王和赛尔中央，认为她有远见，会重建加利法尔，恢复一个奇迹的时代。你有这种感觉吗？你是一个乐观的理想主义者吗？还是你对这个未能保护你的国家感到痛苦和愤怒？你是忠于赛尔，还是只关心达尔古恩和向妖精们复仇？",

What forces can be found patrolling the borders? And what were some of the major innovations of the Last War?": "一眼望去，霍尔韦尔会显得很有中世纪特色。士兵们手持长矛和剑，瑟兰因其弓箭手而闻名。但魔法是五国生活的核心部分，用于通信、运输、娱乐......以及战争。上一次战争的战场上使用了哪些武器？哪些部队可以在边境上巡逻？最后一次战争的一些主要创新是什么？",
	"To clarify what lies ahead: This section does not present a system for running mass combats. Rather, it explores the tools and tactics used in the Last War so that adventures can incorporate those elements into the story. This allows for an adventure in which the heroes have to make their way through a field of {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}, or must seize a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} to halt bombardment. But this section doesn't include a system detailing artillery spotting and the accuracy of sustained bombardment. It explores the tools of the Last War with the intent that they could appear in traditional adventures.": "为了澄清前面的内容。本节并没有提出一个进行大规模战斗的系统。相反，它探讨了最后战争中使用的工具和战术，以便冒险可以将这些元素纳入故事中。这允许冒险中的英雄们必须穿过（%0%）的领域，或者必须夺取一个（%1%）来阻止轰炸。但这一节并不包括详细介绍炮兵发现的系统和持续轰炸的准确性。它探讨了最后战争的工具，目的是让它们可以出现在传统的冒险中。",
	"Wands, staffs, and rods are well-established weapons in the world of Eberron. Similarly, arcane artillery doesn't employ any sort of physical projectile, relying solely on magical energy—but rather than a small weapon one person can easily carry, arcane artillery refers to a variety of larger arcane foci that can increase the range and area of magical attacks. Likewise, the war employed magical explosives such as {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} that could wreak devastation by triggering a previously stored spell.": "魔杖、法杖和棒子是Eberron世界中公认的武器。同样，奥术火炮也不采用任何种类的物理弹丸，完全依靠魔法能量--但奥术火炮不是一个人可以轻易携带的小武器，而是指各种较大的奥术焦点，可以增加魔法攻击的范围和面积。同样，战争中采用了魔法炸药，如{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}，可以通过触发先前储存的法术而造成破坏。",
	"As a general rule, the everyday magic of the Five Nations encompasses spell effects of up to 3rd level; while 4th- and 5th-level effects exist, they are rare and remarkable. This means that effects like {@spell wall of force} could be seen on the battlefield, but were exceptional and rarely deployed, while blasts of fire and lightning were more common.": "一般来说，五国的日常魔法包含了3级以下的法术效果；虽然4级和5级的效果也存在，但它们是罕见的、了不起的。这意味着像（%0%）这样的效果可以在战场上看到，但属于例外，很少部署，而火焰和闪电的爆炸则比较常见。",
	"While a specially trained spellcaster must operate arcane artillery, more than one person can assist with its operation, allowing a team to prime, aim, and fire in a single round.": "虽然必须由受过专门训练的施法者来操作奥术火炮，但不止一个人可以协助其操作，允许一个团队在一个回合内进行填料、瞄准和射击。",
	"All attack rolls and saving throws are based on the spellcasting ability of the operator firing the weapon. When arcane artillery is used to target someone at long range, any attack roll has disadvantage and any saving throw against the spell effect has advantage.": "所有的攻击卷和蓄力都是基于发射武器的操作员的法术能力。当奥术火炮被用来瞄准远距离的人时，任何攻击卷都是劣势，任何针对法术效果的蓄力都是优势。",
	"Using these weapons requires specialized training, similar to that of an artificer or magewright; someone trained to operate arcane artillery is generally called a bombardier. A typical bombardier may use the magewright stat block, but they also know one or more spells that they're only able to cast using a focus—such as a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} or {@object long rod|ExploringEberron}. So an Aundairian specialist might be able to produce {@spell cloudkill} through a focus, but not cast the spell on its own. Bombardiers don't use spell slots when casting these spells; instead, they prime the weapon using a dragonshard solution known as the {@i breath of Siberys}.": "使用这些武器需要专门的训练，类似于工匠或魔法师的训练；受过操作奥术火炮训练的人一般被称为投弹手。一个典型的投弹手可以使用魔法师的属性块，但他们也知道一个或多个法术，他们只能用一个焦点来施放--比如（%0%）或（%1%）。所以一个Aundairian专家可能能够通过一个焦点产生{@spell cloudkill}，但不能单独施放该法术。投弹手在施放这些法术时不使用法术槽；相反，他们使用被称为{@i breath of Siberys}的龙石溶液为武器打底。",
	"However, player characters are more versatile than magewrights or bombardiers. The DM could allow your spellcasting character to use artillery without penalty if it fits the needs of the story or if you have a background that justifies it—for example, if you're a wizard with the soldier background. Otherwise, the DM could say that you can operate it at a penalty: you can't cast spells or make attacks at long range; your attack rolls have disadvantage; and saving throws against your attacks have advantage. As a player character, you can prime the weapon using the {@i breath of Siberys}, or you can expend a spell slot as usual when priming the artillery.": "然而，玩家角色比魔法师或投弹手的用途更广泛。DM可以允许你的法术角色使用火炮而不受惩罚，如果这符合故事的需要，或者你的背景证明了这一点--例如，如果你是一个有士兵背景的魔法师。否则，管理员可以说你可以在受到惩罚的情况下操作它：你不能在远距离施法或进行攻击；你的攻击卷有劣势；对你的攻击进行蓄力攻击有优势。作为一个玩家角色，你可以使用（%0%）给武器打底，或者像往常一样在给火炮打底时消耗一个法术槽。",
	"While arcane artillery is a powerful force, there's still a place for mundane siege engines that use physical projectiles, described in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The {@object ballista}, {@object mangonel}, and {@object trebuchet} are all common forms of artillery, seen on both the battlefield and on warships. However, just as a Thrane archer may have used an enchanted bow, the siege engines of the Last War are enhanced with magical power.": "虽然奥术火炮是一种强大的力量，但使用物理弹丸的世俗攻城引擎仍有一席之地，在《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》的第八章中有所描述。{@object ballista}、{@object mangonel}和{@object trebuchet}都是常见的火炮形式，在战场上和战舰上都能看到。然而，就像瑟兰弓箭手可能使用被施了魔法的弓一样，最后战争的攻城引擎也是用魔法力量加强的。",
	"A siege engine can be partially animated, speeding its use. Generally, an animated engine loads itself while the crew aims it, requiring only two actions to fire an animated ballista or three to use an animated mangonel. House Cannith also manufactured fully animated siege engines, capable of self-aiming. Such an engine required the same number of actions to aim and fire as a crewed engine, it simply had no need of a crew. However, these engines could only follow simple instructions and had little ability to adapt, requiring clear, absolute orders to be effective: {@i \"Continue to attack the north tower until it is destroyed.\"}": "攻城车可以部分动画化，以加快其使用速度。一般来说，在工作人员瞄准它的时候，动画引擎会自动加载，只需要两个动作就可以发射动画弹幕，或者三个动作就可以使用动画芒果。坎尼斯家族还制造了完全动画化的攻城引擎，能够自我瞄准。这样的引擎在瞄准和发射时所需的行动次数与有船员的引擎相同，它只是不需要船员。然而，这些引擎只能听从简单的指令，没有什么适应能力，需要明确、绝对的命令才能有效：（%0%）。",
	"A {@object cannon} is a weapon that can inflict significant bludgeoning damage at great distances. As noted in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, a cannon doesn't have to use gunpowder, and those used in the Last War did not. The most common form of cannon is the {@i elemental cannon} produced by the gnomes of Zilargo, which uses the essence of a bound earth elemental to project stone cannonballs with tremendous force; Zilargo began supplying Breland with these weapons toward the end of the Last War. While Cannith and the Five Nations experimented with other cannon models, the {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} typically filled this role on the battlefield.": "{@object cannon}是一种可以在很远的距离上造成巨大的打击性伤害的武器。如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}所述，大炮不一定要使用火药，在最后一次战争中使用的大炮就没有。最常见的加农炮是由Zilargo的地精生产的{@i elemental cannon}，它使用一个被束缚的土元素的精华来投射具有巨大力量的石制炮弹；Zilargo在最后一次战争结束时开始向布雷兰德提供这些武器。虽然坎尼斯和五国试验了其他的大炮型号，但{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}通常在战场上充当这一角色。",
	"Ballista bolts and mangonel missiles are often enchanted with spell effects that trigger when the bolt strikes its target. This effect is in addition to the standard damage inflicted by the siege engine.": "弩炮弹和芒果导弹通常被赋予法术效果，当弩炮弹击中目标时就会触发。这种效果是在攻城机造成的标准伤害之外的。",
	"{@i Explosive ammunition} affects a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the bolt. Any creature in the area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 3d6}) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Typically, {@i explosive ammunition} deals fire damage, igniting flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. However, Karrnathi {@i deathbolts} deal necrotic damage and only harm living creatures, while Thrane {@i Tira's tears} deal radiant damage.": "{@i Explosive ammunition}影响到以闪电冲击为中心的30英尺半径范围的球体。区域内的任何生物必须做一个{@dc 15}灵巧的蓄力动作，蓄力失败会受到10({@damage 3d6})的伤害，蓄力成功会受到一半的伤害。通常情况下，{@i explosive ammunition}会造成火灾伤害，点燃没有被穿戴或携带的易燃物品。然而，Karrnathi {@i deathbolts}会造成坏死伤害，并且只伤害生物，而Thrane {@i Tira's tears}会造成辐射伤害。",
	"{@i Summoning ammunition} conjures creatures around the point of impact. Aundairian {@i firestones} produce a temporary flaming sphere that randomly rolls around the area of impact. Zil binders developed a more powerful form of this ammunition which casts {@spell conjure elemental} on detonation, but it is extremely costly and rare.": "{@i Summoning ammunition}在撞击点周围召唤生物。Aundairian {@i firestones}产生一个临时的火焰球体，随机地在撞击区域周围滚动。齐尔捆绑器开发了一种更强大的这种弹药，在引爆时施放{@spell conjure elemental}，但它非常昂贵且罕见。",
	"{@i Panic stones} force all creatures within a 90-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the stone to make a {@dc 12} Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw drops whatever it is holding and becomes {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use the {@action Dash} action to move away from the {@i panic stone}. If an affected creature ends its turn more than 90 feet away from the {@i panic stone}, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for that creature.": "{@i Panic stones}迫使以石头撞击为中心的90英尺半径范围内的所有生物做一个{@dc 12}智慧反射。任何失败的生物都会丢掉手中的东西，并在1分钟内变得（%2%）。受到惊吓的生物必须使用{@action Dash}行动来远离{@i panic stone}。如果受影响的生物在距离（%5%）超过90英尺的地方结束其回合，它可以做一个智慧救赎动作。拯救成功后，该生物的效果就会结束。",
	"The {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron} is the most common form of magical explosive used in the Five Nations. While {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} serve a similar role to bombs or landmines, they can produce a wide range of magical effects; a {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron} could trigger a burst of confusion and start a riot, or summon a rampaging elemental into a crowded town square.": "{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron}是五国中最常见的魔法爆炸物形式。虽然(1%)的作用与炸弹或地雷相似，但它们可以产生广泛的魔法效果；(2%)可以引发一阵混乱并引发暴乱，或将一个狂暴的元素召唤到拥挤的城镇广场。",

	"At first glance, the damage associated with many weapons described here may seem low. How is it that a massive siege staff could end up dealing less damage than a {@item staff of fire}? But in developing weapons of war, consider who those weapons are targeting. The typical soldier in the armies of the Five Nations would use the {@creature guard} or {@creature bandit} stat block, both of which have 11 hit points. When large numbers were called for, nations would employ peasant levies, most of who would use the {@creature commoner} stat block with a mere 4 hit points.": "乍一看，这里描述的许多武器的相关伤害可能看起来很低。一个巨大的攻城杖最终造成的伤害怎么会比一个{@item staff of fire}还要低呢？但在开发战争武器时，要考虑这些武器的目标是谁。五国军队中的典型士兵会使用{@creature guard}或{@creature bandit}状态块，它们都有11点命中率。当需要大量的士兵时，国家会雇佣农民，他们中的大多数会使用仅有4点命中率的{@creature commoner}状态块。",
	"Hit points are an abstract concept, a \"combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.\" That range of 4-11 hit points is normal; a typical person on the street could be mortally wounded by a single well-placed crossbow bolt. The high hit points of exceptional individuals—such as player characters—reflect their role as heroes, people who somehow avoid a deadly strike or who can grit their teeth and persevere through damage that would send a lesser person into shock. When designing weapons and battle magic, the mages of Arcanix and artificers of the Twelve were using the typical soldier as the baseline, not a player character.": "命中率是一个抽象的概念，是 \"身体和精神的耐久性、生存意志和运气的结合\"。4-11点的命中率范围是正常的；街上的一个普通人可能会被一个位置良好的弩箭射中而受致命伤。特殊个体的高命中率--比如玩家角色--反映了他们作为英雄的角色，他们以某种方式避免了致命的一击，或者能够咬紧牙关，坚持完成会让一个较小的人陷入休克的伤害。在设计武器和战斗魔法时，阿卡尼克斯的法师和十二星座的工匠们是以典型的士兵为基准，而不是以玩家角色为基准。",
	"So consider the {@spell fireball}. It has a range of 150 feet, affects a 20-foot sphere, and deals {@damage 8d6} fire damage. This is designed for an elite squad fighting against exceptional foes: it deals high damage with a significant area of effect. But imagine you're fighting 120 guards with longbows, who start shooting at you once you enter their long range of 600 feet. You may never get close enough to cast your {@spell fireball}. Even if you do, the damage output is far greater than you need (an average of 28 damage against enemies with 11 hit points). {@spell Fireball} is an excellent tool for a small squad engaging powerful foes, which describes the typical party of adventurers. But on a battlefield of common soldiers, it proves inefficient, as range and radius are more important than high damage output. The {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} may not inflict as much damage as a {@item staff of fire}, but it hits more enemies and from farther away.": "所以要考虑（%0%）。它的范围是150英尺，影响20英尺的范围，并造成{@damage 8d6}的火力伤害。这是为精英小队对抗特殊敌人而设计的：它能造成高额伤害，并有很大的影响范围。但想象一下，你正在与120名手持长弓的卫兵作战，一旦你进入他们600英尺的远距离范围，他们就开始向你射击。你可能永远无法接近到足以施放你的（%2%）。即使你做到了，伤害输出也远远超过你的需要（对11点命中率的敌人平均28点伤害）。{@spell Fireball}是一个小队对付强大敌人的优秀工具，这就是典型的冒险者队伍。但在普通士兵的战场上，它被证明是低效的，因为范围和半径比高伤害输出更重要。(4%)的伤害可能没有(5%)的多，但它能从更远的地方击中更多的敌人。",
	"This impacts how scenes unfold when your player character is on the battlefield. In the interests of story, the DM doesn't want your party to be wiped out by the first blast of a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}; how is that a compelling adventure? Instead, that blast might deal only 12 points of fire damage. It drops half of the soldiers accompanying you (who failed their saving throws), but you and your companions take shelter from the worst of the blast and keep pressing forward. {@damage 3d6} damage may feel low because it won't kill a player character. But it can kill commoners and typical soldiers; the fact that adventurers can keep going under fire shows how remarkable they are.": "这影响到你的玩家角色在战场上的场景如何展开。为了故事的利益，DM不希望你的队伍被{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}的第一次爆炸所消灭；这怎么会是一次引人注目的冒险呢？相反，那场爆炸可能只造成12点火力伤害。它使与你同行的士兵中的一半人死亡（他们的救赎失败），但你和你的同伴们躲避了最严重的爆炸，继续向前推进。(1%）的伤害可能感觉很低，因为它不会杀死一个玩家角色。但它可以杀死平民和典型的士兵；冒险者能在炮火下继续前进，说明他们是多么了不起。",
	"While the elemental airship is a recent innovation, aerial combat has long been a part of warfare. Flying scouts are a basic component of reconnaissance.

The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the {@i war staff} and {@i battle rod}. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it's no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people \"arcane dragoons.\" If you fight your battles with {@spell fire bolt} or {@spell sacred flame}, you're known as a \"wandslinger.\"": "魔法是会进化的。当加利法尔一世建立他的王国时，他的巫师们还没有掌握（%0%）或（%1%）。咒语--可以随意使用的休闲法术--的发展花了几个世纪，因为奥术大会研究了Aereni技术和巫术的力量。联合王国的士兵们依靠的是剑和弓。但是，随着最后一次战争的开始，Aundair对其资源进行了评估。由于奥术大会的存在，昂代尔在神秘主义教育方面领先于加利法尔。组建了第一个奥术兵团，昂代尔开发了{@i war staff}和{@i battle rod}。在最后一次战争的过程中，这些技术传遍了五国和其他国家。今天，看到强悍的探究者或哨兵元帅一手拿着剑，一手拿着魔杖，并不奇怪。但没有人称这些人为 \"奥术兵\"。如果你用（4%）或（5%）打仗，你就被称为 \"魔杖客\"。",

If so, do you display it prominently? Do you carry your {@item fernian ash wand|ERLW|wand of Fernian ash} with pride, twirling it and doing flame tricks? If so, you're a wandslinger.

	"Since NPCs don't follow the same rules as player characters and player characters are exceptional, the DM may decide that an NPC wandslinger needs an arcane focus in order to cast a spell. Player characters are versatile; it's useful for you to have a wand, but you can work around its absence. The typical arcane dragoon needs a wand, rod, or staff in order to cast a spell or cantrip. Here are a few examples of NPC wandslingers:": "由于NPC不遵循与玩家角色相同的规则，而且玩家角色是例外的，所以DM可以决定NPC魔杖手需要一个奥术焦点才能施法。玩家角色是多面手；你有一根魔杖是很有用的，但你可以绕过它的缺失。典型的奥术龙人需要一根魔杖、棒子或法杖，以便施展法术或咒语。这里有几个NPC使用魔杖的例子。",

	"While wandslingers are becoming more commonplace, at the moment this is still an elite specialty. By adding wandslinger capabilities to a standard stat block, such as a guard, you are reflecting specialized training, much like a player character acquiring a feat. If you want to add more national flavor to current or former soldiers, you can add different feats to a stat block. Thrane is known for its archers; if you want to represent an elite Thrane archer, you could use the scout stat block but add the benefits of the {@feat Sharpshooter} feat. Karrnath fielded exceptional heavy infantry, and a Karrnathi knight could gain the benefits of {@feat Heavy Armor Master}.": "虽然魔杖手正变得越来越普遍，但目前这仍然是一个精英专业。通过将巫师的能力添加到一个标准的状态块中，比如说一个卫兵，你就反映了专门的训练，就像玩家角色获得一个壮举。如果你想给现在或以前的士兵添加更多的国家色彩，你可以在一个状态块中添加不同的功绩。瑟兰以其弓箭手而闻名；如果你想表现一个精锐的瑟兰弓箭手，你可以使用侦察兵的状态块，但要加上{@feat Sharpshooter}的壮举的好处。卡尔纳特（Karrnath）的重装步兵非常出色，一个卡尔纳特的骑士可以获得（%1%）的好处。",
	"As Aundair expanded the use of arcane dragoons, it saw the need for spells that could match the range of the Thrane archers, or bring down large numbers of peasant levies. {@spell Force blast|ExploringEberron} is a simple spell that lacks the offensive punch of a {@spell fire bolt}, but has greater range than a longbow and a rarely resisted damage type. {@spell Concussive burst|ExploringEberron} isn't as deadly as {@spell burning hands} or {@spell thunderwave}, but it covers the same area as a {@spell fireball} while being accessible to a wandslinger. These spells may not appeal to player characters, but you could find them in the hands of enemy wandslingers.": "随着昂代尔扩大了对奥术龙骑兵的使用，它看到了对能与瑟兰弓箭手的射程相匹配的法术的需求，或者说能打倒大量农民军的法术。{@spell Force blast|ExploringEberron}是一种简单的法术，缺乏{@spell fire bolt}的攻击力，但比长弓的射程更大，而且是一种很少被抵抗的伤害类型。{@spell Concussive burst|ExploringEberron}不像{@spell burning hands}或{@spell thunderwave}那样致命，但它覆盖的范围与{@spell fireball}相同，同时也能让魔杖手接触到。这些法术可能对玩家角色没有吸引力，但你可以在敌人的巫师手中找到它们。",
	"The wandslinger is trained to use an arcane focus: the power isn't in the wand, it's simply a tool for channeling a spell. But what of magic wands, staffs, and rods? Under the wide-magic principles of Eberron, common and uncommon items are part of the magical industry; rare items are exotic and expensive; and very rare and legendary items are largely beyond the capabilities of Cannith and the Arcane Congress. As such, weapons such as a {@item wand of fireballs} or {@item wand of lightning bolts} could be found on the battlefield, especially when dealing with Aundair, but they were rare, only assigned to elite units and critical operations.": "魔杖手接受了使用奥术焦点的训练：力量不在魔杖里，它只是一个引导咒语的工具。但是魔杖、法杖和棒子呢？在Eberron的广泛魔法原则下，普通和不普通的物品是魔法产业的一部分；稀有物品是异国情调和昂贵的；而非常稀有和传奇的物品基本上超出了Cannith和奥术大会的能力。因此，像{@item wand of fireballs}或{@item wand of lightning bolts}这样的武器可以在战场上找到，特别是在对付昂代尔的时候，但它们很罕见，只分配给精英部队和关键行动。",
	"However, House Cannith and Aundair's Arcane Congress are always working to produce more efficient weapons, and the {@item wand of magic missiles} is one such recent development. Prior versions of the wand were more expensive, could only be used by trained spellcasters, or didn't regain charges. The {@item wand of magic missiles} breaks this barrier: it's an uncommon magic item that doesn't require attunement and can be used by any creature. A wealthy wandslinger could carry a brace of wands, unleashing a barrage of bolts from a new wand each round. {@item Wands of magic missiles} may be found in the hands of criminal enforcers, royal guards, or any number of other professionals, and can potentially be purchased across the Five Nations. However, they were perfected by the Arcane Congress just twelve years ago, and House Cannith has yet to replicate that technique. As a result, these wands are primarily found in Aundair or used by Aundairians; a wand being sold in Sharn may be surplus or salvage recovered from Aundairian soldiers during the war.": "然而，坎尼斯家族和昂代尔的奥术大会一直在努力生产更有效的武器，{@item wand of magic missiles}就是这样的一个最新发展。之前的魔杖版本比较昂贵，只能由训练有素的施法者使用，或者不能恢复充电。1%）打破了这一障碍：它是一种不常见的魔法物品，不需要调谐，任何生物都可以使用。一个富有的魔杖手可以带着一串魔杖，每回合从一个新的魔杖中释放出一连串的子弹。{@item Wands of magic missiles}可能会出现在犯罪执行者、皇家卫队或任何其他专业人士的手中，并有可能在整个五国买到。然而，它们是由奥术大会在十二年前完善的，而坎尼斯家族还没有复制这种技术。因此，这些魔杖主要在昂代尔发现，或者由昂代尔人使用；在沙恩出售的魔杖可能是战争期间从昂代尔士兵那里回收的剩余或残余物。",
	"Sooner or later House Cannith will duplicate this item and they'll become available at any Cannith enclave. But for now, these wands can still be difficult to find outside Aundair.": "坎尼斯家族迟早会复制这种物品，它们会在任何一个坎尼斯的飞地都能买到。但现在，这些魔杖在昂代尔之外仍然很难找到。",
	"Throughout the Last War, Cyre poured gold into House Cannith's coffers, urging them to develop ever-deadlier weapons. In 959 YK, Cannith presented Queen Dannel with the first warforged titans. For a time, this gave Cyre an edge—but as always, Cannith began selling these creations to other nations, as well as selling {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} and {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs} to those who needed to fight titans.": "在整个最后一次战争中，赛尔将黄金注入坎尼斯家族的库房，敦促他们开发更多的致命武器。在公元959年，坎尼斯向丹妮尔女王展示了第一批战争锻造的泰坦巨人。一时间，这给赛尔带来了优势--但像往常一样，坎尼斯开始向其他国家出售这些作品，同时也向那些需要与泰坦战斗的人出售（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"During the Last War, the warforged titan served a number of critical roles. The mere presence of an imposing titan provided a defensive bulwark for infantry, as enemy infantry could rarely afford to engage a titan without artillery or magical support. Titans are tireless, surprisingly swift, and capable of crossing almost any terrain. Thanks to the Siege Monster ability, they are also devastatingly effective against fortifications and siege engines.": "在最后的战争中，战争锻造的泰坦有许多关键作用。一个强大的泰坦的存在为步兵提供了一个防御堡垒，因为敌人的步兵很少能在没有火炮或魔法支持的情况下与泰坦作战。泰坦是不知疲倦的，令人惊讶的迅速，并且能够穿越几乎所有的地形。得益于围攻怪物的能力，它们对防御工事和攻城引擎也有毁灭性的效果。",
	"The statistics of a basic warforged titan, as described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, grant it additional versatility from its Platforms trait. A titan has two platforms in its chassis, each designed to hold one medium or smaller creature. Typically, these platforms hold archers, providing the warforged with some minimal ranged support to complement its powerful melee attacks. However, specialized crew can dramatically increase the capabilities of a titan: an evoker can provide strong ranged attacks, while an abjurer can stand ready to counter or dispel enemy magic, and an onboard artificer can keep the titan operational. Sending your titan against Karrnathi undead? An exorcist can be a boon for dealing with undead. Alternatively, a titan could simply serve as a battering ram, carrying two spies or commandos ready to leap off and blend into an enemy community as soon as the titan breaches a defensive wall.": "如同{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}所述，基本的战神泰坦的统计资料，从它的平台特质中赋予了它额外的多功能性。泰坦的底盘上有两个平台，每个平台可以容纳一个中型或小型生物。一般来说，这些平台可以容纳弓箭手，为战神提供一些最低限度的远程支持，以补充其强大的近战攻击。然而，专门的船员可以极大地提高泰坦的能力：一个唤醒者可以提供强大的远程攻击，而一个堕落者可以随时准备反击或驱散敌人的魔法，而船上的工匠可以保持泰坦的运作。派你的泰坦去对付卡尔纳特的亡灵？驱魔师可以成为对付亡灵的利器。另外，泰坦可以简单地充当攻城车，携带两名间谍或突击队员，准备在泰坦突破防御墙后立即跳下，混入敌人社区。",
	"While the warforged titan stat block represents the basic design, over the course of nearly forty years in service, there were many variations on that design. Consider using one of these options as a way to add flavor to a titan.": "虽然战神泰坦的属性块代表了基本的设计，但在近四十年的服役过程中，这个设计有很多变化。考虑使用这些选项中的一个，作为增加泰坦的风味的一种方式。",
	"One of the titan's weapons can be replaced with an integrated ballista. This weapon is self-loading and conjures ammunition. If the titan has an armbow, replace either the axehand or hammerfist with the following attack:": "泰坦的一种武器可以被替换成综合弹弓。这种武器可以自动装弹，并能变出弹药。如果泰坦有一个臂弓，用以下的攻击方式取代斧手或锤拳。",

	"Late in the war, Cannith developed titans that had only one platform, with a {@object long rod|ExploringEberron} (as described in the \"Arcane Artillery\" section) integrated in place of the other platform.": "在战争后期，坎尼斯开发了只有一个平台的泰坦巨人，在另一个平台的位置上集成了一个（%0%）（如 \"奥术火炮 \"部分所述）。",
	"Titans serving in particular regions were often shielded against a relevant type of elemental damage. For example, force and fire were the damage types most typically tied to {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} or {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs}, so Cannith often designed titans with resistance to one of these damage types.": "在特定地区服役的泰坦常常被屏蔽在相关类型的元素伤害之外。例如，力和火是最典型的与{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}或{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs}相关的伤害类型，所以坎尼斯在设计泰坦时经常对这些伤害类型之一进行抵抗。",
	"The titan has a hollow space within its chassis and can carry up to 6 Medium creatures or extra cargo. Due to the loss of body mass, a model made for transport only has an Armor Class of 18 and 100 hit points, but increases its walking speed to 45 feet.": "泰坦的底盘内有一个中空的空间，最多可以携带6个中型生物或额外的货物。由于身体质量的损失，为运输而制造的模型只有18的装甲等级和100的命中率，但将其行走速度提高到45英尺。",
	"While called \"warforged,\" the titans are quite different from the truly living constructs that came after them. Titans have limited sentience. They imprint on their commanders, and to a lesser degree, on the uniforms of their allies. They can follow orders and general instructions such as \"protect allies\" or \"engage enemies.\" But as a rule, titans don't feel emotion, reflected by the fact that they're immune to being charmed or frightened. Today, most remaining titans are simply waiting in storage, content to remain motionless until it's time to serve again.": "虽然被称为 \"战神\"，但泰坦与他们之后的真正的生命体有很大不同。泰坦拥有有限的知觉。他们在指挥官身上留下印记，在较小的程度上，在他们的盟友的制服上留下印记。它们可以服从命令和一般指令，如 \"保护盟友 \"或 \"与敌人交战\"。但通常情况下，泰坦巨人不会感受到情感，这体现在他们对被迷惑或被惊吓是免疫的。今天，大多数剩余的泰坦只是在仓库里等待，满足于保持不动，直到再次服务的时间。",
	"Yet there are stories of titans who've developed full consciousness. If the tales are true, this could be the result of rogue artificers (possibly cultists of the Traveler hidden within House Cannith), or it could be a random spark of evolution—suggesting that the potential for sentience lies within all titans.": "然而，有一些关于泰坦巨人发展出完整意识的故事。如果这些故事是真的，这可能是流氓工匠（可能是隐藏在坎尼斯家族中的旅行者的崇拜者）的结果，也可能是进化的随机火花--暗示着所有泰坦都有潜在的智慧。",
	"A sentient titan loses its immunity to psychic damage. It's no longer immune to being frightened or charmed, but it has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause these conditions. Its Intelligence increases to 10 (or higher) and it is capable of making its own decisions.": "有知觉的泰坦失去了对精神伤害的免疫力。它不再对被惊吓或被迷惑有免疫力，但它对造成这些情况的效果有救命的优势。它的智力增加到10（或更高），并且能够做出自己的决定。",

	"There are challenges facing every society, problems that need to be solved. Communication. Transportation. Even entertainment. In Khorvaire, magic is the tool people use to solve these problems.

	"The Five Nations are built on a foundation of magical tools and services. Arcane magic is understood to be a form of science: anyone with the aptitude for it can train at a house trade school to become a magewright or learn how to be a wandslinger. There's nothing strange about seeing an airship in the sky or sending a message to a distant friend using a {@item speaking stone|ERLW}.": "五国是建立在魔法工具和服务的基础上的。奥术魔法被理解为一种科学形式：任何有这方面才能的人都可以在房屋贸易学校接受培训，成为一名魔法师，或者学习如何成为一名魔杖手。在天空中看到一艘飞艇，或者用{@item speaking stone|ERLW}给远方的朋友发送消息，这并不奇怪。",
	"However, a common maxim about Khorvaire is that it possesses \"wide magic, not high magic.\" While the {@item speaking stone|ERLW} allows you to send messages between two stone stations, {@spell sending} is a rarer service that fewer people can afford. {@spell Lesser restoration} is available at any good Jorasco healing house, but {@spell raise dead} isn't so trivial.": "然而，关于霍尔韦尔的一句常见格言是，它拥有 \"广泛的魔法，而不是高超的魔法\"。虽然{@item speaking stone|ERLW}可以让你在两个石站之间发送消息，但{@spell sending}是一种比较罕见的服务，很少有人能负担得起。{@spell Lesser restoration}在任何好的乔拉斯科治疗所都可以得到，但{@spell raise dead}就不是那么微不足道了。",
	"As a broad rule, the people of Khorvaire are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or spells of 1st and 2nd level. They're familiar with 3rd-level spells—{@spell fireball||fireballs} on the battlefield, aristocrats using Sivis {@spell sending} services—but these things are expensive. Effects of 4th or 5th level are known—Orien maintains a network of teleportation circles, the dead can be raised, an oracle can cast {@spell divination}—but these things aren't part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn't expect to run into them. Magical effects of 6th level or higher are usually the product of more advanced civilizations—the dragons of Argonnessen, the elves of Aerenal, the ancient giants of Xen'drik. The same principle applies to magic items. Common and uncommon items are part of everyday life. Rare items exist, but they're rare. And very rare and legendary items are typically the product of advanced civilizations or remarkable events.": "作为一项广泛的规则，Khorvaire的人们习惯于与那些模仿一、二级咒语或法术的工具和服务打交道。他们熟悉三级法术--{@spell fireball||fireballs}在战场上，贵族们使用Sivis{@spell sending}服务--但这些东西都很昂贵。四级或五级的效果是已知的--奥利安维持着一个传送圈网络，死人可以复活，神谕者可以施展（%2%）--但这些东西并不是日常生活的一部分，一般的平民不会期望碰到它们。六级以上的魔法效果通常是更先进的文明的产物--阿贡尼森的龙，艾瑞纳的精灵，Xen'drik的古代巨人。同样的原则也适用于魔法物品。普通和不普通的物品是日常生活的一部分。稀有物品存在，但它们很罕见。而非常稀有和传奇的物品通常是先进文明或非凡事件的产物。",
	"There are exceptions to this rule. There are higher-level spellcasters in the world: Mordain the Fleshweaver, Jaela Daran, the Great Druid Oalian. But civilization is built on a foundation of common and uncommon items, and spells of 3rd level and below. High-level spellcasters are capable of remarkable feats, but these can't yet be mass produced.": "这条规则也有例外。世界上有更高级别的施法者。编肉者莫尔丹、杰拉-达兰、大德鲁伊-奥里安。但文明是建立在普通和不普通的物品以及3级及以下法术的基础上的。高级别的法术师能够做出非凡的功绩，但这些还不能大规模生产。",
	"Common magic items are common throughout Khorvaire. This isn't to say they are trivial—{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} sets the price of a common magic item at {@dice 2d4*10|2d4 × 10} gp, so even the simplest item will cost 20 gp. A farmer might treasure her {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} and the gown of {@item clothes of mending|XGE} that has been in her family for generations, while a wealthy young noble may flaunt his {@item glamerweave|ERLW} and {@item cloak of many fashions|XGE}.": "普通魔法物品在整个Khorvaire都很常见。这并不是说它们是微不足道的--{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}规定普通魔法物品的价格为{@dice 2d4*10|2d4 × 10}gp，所以即使是最简单的物品也要花费20gp。一个农民可能会珍惜她的{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}和她家世代相传的{@item clothes of mending|XGE}的长袍，而一个富有的年轻贵族可能会炫耀他的{@item glamerweave|ERLW}和{@item cloak of many fashions|XGE}。",
	"Common magic items generally aren't all sold in one place. A high-class tailor will sell both mundane and magical clothes, but you can't buy an everbright lantern at their shop.

	"Beyond this, consider that both in price and description, there's a wide range of quality between items, reflected in the range of price. A 20 gp {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} is ugly but functional, while for 80 gp you can get one inlaid with beautiful patterns, and you might even be able to adjust the shade and brilliance of the light source. {@item Glamerweave|ERLW} is clothing that's been imbued with illusions: both the quality of the base clothing and the illusion factor into the cost, and the finest glamerweave can be far more than 80 gp. In short, the magic item description tells you what a common item {@i does}, but it's also an object beyond that, and it's good to think about its form and quality.": "除此之外，考虑到无论是价格还是描述，物品之间的质量差异很大，反映在价格范围上。一个20戈比（%0%）的东西很丑，但很实用，而花80戈比就可以得到一个镶嵌着美丽图案的东西，你甚至可以调整光源的阴影和亮度。(1%)是被注入了幻觉的衣服：基本衣服的质量和幻觉都是成本的考虑因素，而最好的冰晶织品可能远远超过80戈比。简而言之，魔法物品描述告诉你什么是普通物品（%2%），但它也是一个超出这个范围的物品，考虑一下它的形式和质量是很好的。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} only calls out common magic items, but at the DM's discretion, uncommon magic items can also be purchased in major cities (especially in Aundair). Such items are more expensive—the price is typically between 200-500 gp, set by the DM based on the power and quality of the item—but selection will be far more limited. Just because you could theoretically purchase a {@item cloak of protection} doesn't mean one is always available in that particular shop or town. However, an exceptional weaponsmith may have a {@item +1 weapon} for sale or take a commission to create one, and large House Sivis enclaves often sell {@item sending stones}. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide what sort of uncommon magic items are available and who is selling them.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}只叫出了常见的魔法物品，但根据DM的决定，不常见的魔法物品也可以在主要城市（尤其是在Aundair）购买。这类物品更加昂贵--价格通常在200-500戈比之间，由DM根据物品的威力和质量来确定--但选择也会更加有限。理论上你能买到（1%）并不意味着在那个特定的商店或城镇里总能买到。然而，一个出色的武器匠可能会有一个{@item +1 weapon}出售，或者接受委托制造一个，而大型的西维斯家族飞地经常出售{@item sending stones}。归根结底，要由DM来决定什么样的不常见的魔法物品是可用的，以及谁在出售它们。",
	"Chapter 7 includes a list of dragonmark focus items. These represent that it's easier to create an item that can only be used by someone with a dragonmark—presenting focus versions of other magic items, but with a reduced rarity. Dragonmark focus items can only be created by a character with the Mark of Making or the dragonmark used by the item; while they are more common than similar items that work for unmarked characters, they are typically only available through the dragonmarked houses and often only as rewards for house service.": "第七章包括一份龙纹重点物品的清单。这些物品代表着更容易创造出只有拥有龙纹的人才能使用的物品--呈现出其他魔法物品的焦点版本，但稀有度降低。龙纹聚焦物品只能由拥有制造印记或物品所使用的龙纹的角色创造；虽然它们比对无印记的角色有效的类似物品更常见，但它们通常只能通过有龙纹的家族获得，而且往往只能作为家族服务的奖励。",
	"Most magic items are portable and designed for adventurers. However, you may also encounter magic items that are meant for industrial use. Just as a dragonmark focus item is easier to create because of its limitations, a large, immovable industrial item can make a rare or uncommon item's properties accessible to the public. An Aundairian village may have a large {@item cleansing stone|ERLW} set into the town square. If a theater has a magical tool that can generate {@spell minor illusion||minor illusions}, it could be similar in size and shape to a pipe organ. Essentially, in thinking about the magical items that people may encounter, keep in mind that they aren't necessarily designed for use in adventuring!": "大多数魔法物品都是便携式的，为冒险者设计。然而，你也可能遇到为工业用途设计的魔法物品。就像龙纹重点物品因其局限性而更容易创造一样，一个大型的、不可移动的工业物品可以使一个稀有或不常见的物品的属性为公众所了解。一个Aundairian村庄可能有一个大型的（%0%）设置在城镇广场。如果一个剧院有一个能产生（%1%）的魔法工具，它的大小和形状可能与管风琴相似。基本上，在思考人们可能遇到的魔法物品时，请记住它们不一定是为了在冒险中使用而设计的!",
	"The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the {@creature magewright|ERLW|magewrights}: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright knows few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they're able to cast them in ways others cannot.": "Eberron的魔法经济是建立在{@creature magewright|ERLW|magewrights}的基础上的：那些知道少数几个咒语或仪式的施法者，使他们能够提供重要的服务。巫师是出类拔萃的；他们通过几个小时的学习就能准备好任何法术，这反映了他们非凡的天赋和多才多艺。相比之下，魔法师知道的法术很少，但由于他们对这些法术的强烈关注，他们能够以其他人无法做到的方式施展这些法术。",
	"An artificer is equally exceptional. Most of the people assembling magic items at Cannith forgeholds aren't artificers; they work using industrialized processes, massive tools that enhance the creation process (like the {@i creation forge}), and house resources. These craftspeople couldn't just create a wand at home alone. By contrast, as an artificer, you are unconventional, using personalized techniques and improvising solutions.": "一个工匠同样是个例外。在Cannith锻造厂组装魔法物品的大多数人都不是工匠；他们使用工业化的流程、增强创造过程的大型工具（比如（%0%））和房屋资源来工作。这些工匠不可能只在家里单独创造一根魔杖。相比之下，作为一个工匠，你是非常规的，使用个性化的技术和即兴的解决方案。",
	"Just because {@i you} can create any common magic item with little time and effort doesn't mean that this is typical or that others could duplicate your work. Never forget that in Eberron, {@i player characters are exceptional}. Even at low levels, you have potential that the common magewright can't match. There are also exceptional NPCs, ones who can do things player characters cannot; but remember that as a player character, not everyone who follows your path can match your abilities.": "仅仅因为{@i you}可以用很少的时间和精力创造任何普通的魔法物品，并不意味着这是典型的，或者其他人可以复制你的工作。永远不要忘记，在Eberron，（%1%）。即使在低级别的情况下，你也有普通魔法师无法比拟的潜力。也有出类拔萃的NPC，那些能做到玩家角色无法做到的事情；但请记住，作为一个玩家角色，并不是每个追随你的人都能与你的能力相媲美。",
	"For simplicity's sake, magewrights cast spells from the existing spell lists. But magewright spells are unique in a few ways. First of all, magewrights cast all their spells as rituals—even spells that don't normally have the ritual tag. The drawback is that they can only be cast as rituals with an extended casting time. All magewright spells have a minimum casting time of 10 minutes, and the DM can choose to give a spell an even longer casting time; it may take a medium a full hour to cast {@spell speak with dead}.": "为了简单起见，魔法师从现有的法术列表中施展法术。但魔法师的法术在几个方面是独特的。首先，魔法师把他们所有的法术都当作仪式来施放--即使是那些通常没有仪式标签的法术。缺点是，它们只能作为有延长施法时间的仪式来施放。所有魔法师的法术都有至少10分钟的施法时间，而DM可以选择给一个法术更长的施法时间；它可能需要一个中等人整整一个小时来施法（%0%）。",
	"As magewrights can only cast spells as rituals, they don't use spell slots. But they do require a surge of magical energy to power the spell, typically generated by refined Eberron dragonshards, the fuel of arcane industry.": "由于魔法师只能以仪式的形式施展法术，他们不使用法术槽。但他们确实需要大量的魔法能量来驱动咒语，这些能量通常由精炼的艾伯伦龙石产生，是奥术工业的燃料。",
	"When a magewright performs a ritual, it consumes an amount of Eberron dragonshards worth 20 gp × the spell's level, in addition to any costly material components of the spell. This is the cost to the magewright to cast the spell; they might charge far more for offering that service to others, generally at least twice the casting cost. Following the general limitations of everyday magic, it's unusual to encounter a magewright that can cast a spell of 4th level or higher, and any such magewright would likely charge a significant premium for their services.": "当一个魔法师执行一个仪式时，除了法术中任何昂贵的物质成分外，它还会消耗价值为20gp×法术等级的Eberron龙石。这是魔法师施法的成本；他们为他人提供服务时可能会收取更多的费用，通常至少是施法成本的两倍。按照日常魔法的一般限制，能施放四级或更高级别的法术的魔法师并不多见，任何这样的魔法师都可能为他们的服务收取相当高的费用。",
	"Here are two new cantrips you might find employed by a magewright, other NPC, or player character in Khorvaire.": "这里有两个新的咒语，你可能会发现魔法师、其他NPC或玩家角色在霍尔韦尔使用的咒语。",
	"At DM discretion, a magewright's spells may have expanded—or limited—effects. Consider what it takes to make a spell a viable commercial service. For example, {@spell augury} only allows the caster to predict events 30 minutes in the future—useful for adventurers in the midst of a dungeon, but not for the farmer wanting an opinion on planting crops. A professional oracle might be able to predict woe or weal anywhere from a day to a week in advance—but such an oracle could have very specific limitations, such as only being able to make predictions related to weather or agriculture. As a DM, use the existing spells as a model, but adjust them as necessary to create a viable business.": "根据DM的决定，魔法师的法术可以有扩大的或有限的效果。考虑如何才能使一个法术成为可行的商业服务。例如，{@spell augury}只允许施法者预测未来30分钟内的事件--这对在地牢中的冒险者来说是有用的，但对想要对种植庄稼提出意见的农民来说就不是了。一个专业的神谕者也许能够提前一天到一周预测祸福，但这样的神谕者可能有非常具体的限制，比如只能预测与天气或农业有关的事情。作为DM，使用现有的法术作为模型，但要根据需要进行调整，以创建一个可行的企业。",
	"Player characters can't duplicate these effects. The unique aspects of magewright spells reflect both their devotion to a single subject and personal aptitude; the oracle has a unique talent for divination that even a diviner wizard can't replicate. Player characters have unmatched potential and great versatility; magewrights are extremely limited, but have unique advantages.": "玩家角色无法复制这些效果。魔法师法术的独特之处，既反映了他们对单一主题的奉献，也反映了个人的能力；神谕者在占卜方面有独特的天赋，即使是占卜师的巫师也无法复制。玩家角色具有无可比拟的潜力和极大的通用性；魔法师的能力极其有限，但却有独特的优势。",
	"In Aerenal, almost every citizen knows a few cantrips. The Five Nations aren't quite so advanced; there, cantrips are common, but still reflect specialized training. Most people rely on common magic items; a magewright can be proud of their talents, though just as magewrights have a narrow spell selection, their cantrips are also more limited than those used by player characters. A magewright chef uses effects similar to {@spell prestidigitation} to heat and flavor food, but they can't conjure illusions or extinguish flames. The idea is that the most versatile cantrips—such as {@spell prestidigitation} and {@spell thaumaturgy}—represent knowledge of a range of discrete spell effects, all categorized under one greater cantrip. Your spell list merely says {@spell prestidigitation}, but that encompasses a host of lesser cantrips; when you extinguish a fire, you're actually casting {@i incendiary purge}, and when you chill your drink, you're performing {@i culinary transmutation}. While this has no effect on player characters, consider that magewrights and other lesser spellcasters might only know limited forms of common cantrips, such as the following:": "在Aerenal，几乎每个公民都知道一些咒语。五国并不那么先进；在那里，咒语很常见，但仍然反映了专门的训练。大多数人都依赖普通的魔法物品；魔法师可以为自己的才能感到自豪，不过就像魔法师的法术选择很窄一样，他们的咒语也比玩家角色使用的咒语更有限。魔法师的厨师使用类似于（%0%）的效果来加热和调味食物，但他们不能施展幻术或熄灭火焰。我们的想法是，最通用的咒语--比如{@spell prestidigitation}和{@spell thaumaturgy}--代表了一系列不连续的法术效果的知识，都被归入一个更大的咒语。你的法术清单上只写着（%3%），但这包含了一系列较小的咒语；当你灭火时，你实际上是在施放（%4%），而当你冷却饮料时，你在执行（%5%）。虽然这对玩家角色没有影响，但考虑到魔法师和其他较低级的施法者可能只知道普通咒语的有限形式，比如说以下这些。",

	"Magewrights weave magic into their work. They are not only limited spellcasters, but skilled professionals who use magic as a tool. In addition to a limited range of magic ability, magewrights are also skilled in the mundane aspects of their specialty. A magewright chef doesn't make food by snapping their fingers; they're skilled with cook's utensils, as well as using {@i culinary transmutation} and {@i Zolan zest} as tools in their repertoire. Below are a few examples of magewright professions.": "魔法师将魔法编织到他们的工作中。他们不仅是有限的施法者，而且是将魔法作为一种工具的熟练的专业人员。除了有限的魔法能力之外，魔法师还精通他们专业的世俗方面。魔法师的厨师不是靠打响指就能做出食物的；他们熟练使用厨具，以及使用（%0%）和（%1%）作为他们剧目中的工具。以下是几个关于魔法师职业的例子。",

	"No dragonmarked house trains mediums. Instead, some come from communities steeped in the Blood of Vol, while others are Vassals who invoke Aureon and the Keeper. A medium performs {@spell speak with dead} as a ritual, and many use a form of {@spell minor illusion} to conjure up an image of the deceased in conjunction with the ritual. Some less-scrupulous mediums rely on {@skill Insight}, {@spell History}, or {@spell Deception} to simulate speaking with the dead without going through the full ritual.": "没有龙纹屋会训练媒介。相反，有些人来自于深受沃尔之血影响的社区，而有些人则是召唤奥瑞恩和守护者的附庸。灵媒将{@spell speak with dead}作为一种仪式来执行，许多人在仪式中使用{@spell minor illusion}的形式来召唤出死者的形象。一些不那么狡猾的灵媒依靠（%2%）、（%3%）或（%4%）来模拟与死者对话，而不经过完整的仪式。",

	"Licensed by the Warning Guild of House Medani, truthtellers are proficient in {@skill Insight} and can cast {@spell zone of truth} as a ritual.

	"Arcane magic is a science—magewrights master its techniques. However, there are other forms of magic which can likewise be adapted to everyday functions. An adept derives their magic from their faith, a more limited form of what a cleric can do; similarly, a gleaner masters the simplest forms of druidic magic. Especially with the adept, this is more of a calling than a job; you don't decide to become an oracle of Aureon, you find that you are gifted with visions. The rituals of an adept invoke divine forces, while a gleaner draws on the world around them and often uses an herbalism kit as a spellcasting focus. Adepts are common in Thrane and other religious communities, while gleaners provide useful services in the Eldeen Reaches.": "奥术魔法是一门科学--魔法师们掌握着它的技术。然而，还有其他形式的魔法也同样可以适应日常功能。精通者的魔法来自于他们的信仰，是牧师所能做到的更有限的形式；同样，拾荒者掌握最简单形式的德鲁伊魔法。特别是对行者来说，这更像是一种召唤而非工作；你不是决定要成为奥瑞恩的神谕，而是发现自己有幻觉的天赋。精通者的仪式会调用神圣的力量，而拾荒者则会利用他们周围的世界，并经常使用草药包作为施法的重点。精通者在瑟恩和其他宗教团体中很常见，而拾荒者则在Eldeen Reaches提供有用的服务。",
	"The people of Eberron don't use mechanical clocks, and if you're in a Mror mine or the heart of one of Sharn's towers, you can't see the sun. So how do you tell time?": "Eberron的人们不使用机械钟，如果你在Moror矿区或Sharn的一个塔楼的中心，你就看不到太阳。那么，你是如何计算时间的呢？",
	"The answer is simple: magic. There are a wide range of cantrips that tell time—some tied to an absolute time, some tied to the moons, some set to a local time. In Eberron, any character that has the skill to cast {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell thaumaturgy}, or {@spell druidcraft} can produce an additional effect allowing them to tell time. Clocks in Eberron are common magic items, and in most major cities, bells are rung to identify the hour; three bells means \"three o'clock.\" An {@item orb of time|XGE} is another common magic item—a small polished stone disk, often connected to a chain like a pocket watch—that tells time.": "答案很简单：魔法。有各种各样的咒语可以显示时间，有些与绝对时间有关，有些与月亮有关，有些与当地时间有关。在Eberron，任何拥有施放{@spell prestidigitation}、{@spell thaumaturgy}或{@spell druidcraft}技能的角色都可以产生一个额外的效果，使他们能够判断时间。在艾伯伦，时钟是常见的魔法物品，在大多数大城市，钟声会被敲响以确定时间；三个钟声意味着 \"三点钟\"。{@item orb of time|XGE}是另一种常见的魔法物品--一个打磨过的小石盘，通常像怀表一样与一条链子相连，可以显示时间。",

	"Most theaters employ illusions to add special effects to a performance, whether provided by magewrights or static items. Dream parlors provide entirely illusory entertainment. House Phiarlan's latest innovation is the {@i crystal theater}. A large device uses a tiny scrying crystal to project an image on a screen. The crystal is tied to a single location—one of the grand stages in House Phiarlan's central demesnes. This allows the patrons of a crystal theater to watch a live performance occurring on a distant stage. As this practice expands, this could provide entertainers and bards with a global reach; Phiarlan might even pay adventurers to license the rights to dramatize their exploits.": "大多数剧院都采用幻觉来为表演增加特殊效果，无论是由魔术师还是静态物品提供。梦幻厅则提供完全虚幻的娱乐。皮亚伦家族的最新创新是（%0%）。一个大型设备使用一个微小的窥探水晶在屏幕上投射出一个图像。水晶被绑在一个单一的位置--菲亚尔兰家族中央领地的大舞台。这使得水晶剧院的观众可以观看到远处舞台上发生的现场表演。随着这种做法的扩大，这可以为艺人和吟游诗人提供全球范围的影响；Phiarlan甚至可以付钱给冒险家，让他们授权将自己的事迹戏剧化。",
	"One form of fashion that hasn't been discussed in depth is the practice of {@i cosmetic transmutation}. A magewright beautician can perform a range of minor transformations—for a price. Minor cosmetic transmutation is quite common; most professional beauticians can change your hair or eye color. Unnatural effects are rarer, seen mainly in Aundair and Zilargo; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in Fairhaven, and in the days before Galifar, the nobles of Thaliost would adopt elf features. The effects of cosmetic transmutation typically last a week, but if you're dealing with a magewright of sufficient skill, you can extend the effect to one month. In some cities, you might even find an expert who can make the change permanent. The more complicated the transmutation, the more costly—and hard to find—the service becomes.": "一种还没有被深入讨论的时尚形式是（%0%）的做法。 小规模的美容改造是很常见的；大多数专业美容师可以改变你的头发或眼睛的颜色。非自然的效果比较少见，主要出现在昂代尔和齐拉尔戈；金属发色是费尔海文最近的流行趋势，在加利法尔之前的日子里，塔利奥斯特的贵族们会采用精灵的特征。化妆品转化的效果通常会持续一周，但如果你面对的是一个有足够技能的魔法师，你可以将效果延长到一个月。在一些城市，你甚至可以找到一个专家，他可以使变化永久化。改造越复杂，服务就越昂贵，也越难找到。",

However, the standard fare is 2 sp per mile, which is modest to comfortable in its appointments. Those on a budget can book passage in steerage for only 2 cp per mile, but this is typically squalid or poor in quality, and a long journey can be dangerous.

	"Manifest zones are areas where the influence of the other planes bleeds through into the Material Plane. {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} presents some possible manifest zone effects, and chapter 5 of this book explores these in more depth. Some manifest zones are dangerous, and such regions are shunned. However, other manifest zones have effects that can be quite useful for commerce or industry, and like any natural resource, these tend to be harnessed over time. The towers of Sharn are made possible by the manifest zone to Syrania, and any other city with a similar zone could support skycoaches and high towers. Lamannian manifest zones often promote fertility and growth, and many of the greatest farms and vineyards in Khorvaire are in such zones. Ultimately, this is one more factor in the wide magic of Khorvaire: it's not simply what spells can be cast, it's that there are places in the world itself that are inherently magical.": "显化区是其他位面的影响渗入物质位面的区域。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}介绍了一些可能的显灵区效应，本书第五章对这些效应进行了更深入的探讨。有些显灵区是危险的，这样的区域被避开了。然而，其他显化区的效果对商业或工业相当有用，就像任何自然资源一样，这些效果往往会随着时间的推移而被利用起来。沙恩的塔楼是由通往西拉尼亚的显露区实现的，任何其他拥有类似显露区的城市都可以支持空中客车和高塔。拉曼尼亚的显露区经常促进肥沃和增长，霍尔韦尔许多最伟大的农场和葡萄园都在这样的区域。归根结底，这是霍尔韦尔广泛的魔力的又一个因素：这不是简单的可以施展什么法术，而是世界上有些地方本身就有魔力。",
	"Arcane magic is a science. Wizards use words of power and mystic gestures, but there are many ways to channel arcane energies—suspended in the liquid of a potion, trapped in the sigils of a scroll, or focused through a wand.": "奥术魔法是一门科学。巫师们使用力量的语言和神秘的手势，但有许多方法可以引导奥术能量--悬浮在药水的液体中，被困在卷轴的符号中，或通过魔杖集中。",
	"The artificer is an arcane engineer; instead of working directly with mystical energy, they use tools to perform wonders. In a world where wandslingers take to the battlefields and airships sail through the skies, artificers are innovators and inventors developing tools to shape the future. Chapter 6 presents two new artificer subclasses and a number of infusions, representing the diversity of artifice styles and specializations.": "工匠是一个神秘的工程师；他们不直接使用神秘的能量，而是使用工具来创造奇迹。在一个巫师走上战场、飞艇在天空中航行的世界中，工匠是创新者和发明家，他们开发工具来塑造未来。第6章介绍了两个新的工匠子类和一些灌注，代表了工匠风格和专业的多样性。",
	"As an artificer, you possess remarkable talents. You don't need the eldritch machines or vast resources that are traditionally involved in arcane industry, and can produce magical effects using just your personal tools. But what's the foundation of your magic? Are you building on the basic principles used by House Cannith or exploring less traditional paths of arcane science?": "作为一个工匠，你拥有非凡的才能。你不需要传统上涉及奥术工业的超自然机器或大量资源，只需使用你的个人工具就能产生神奇的效果。但你的魔法的基础是什么？你是建立在坎尼斯家族使用的基本原则之上，还是探索不那么传统的奥术科学之路？",
	"The {@table Artificer Techniques|ExploringEberron} table presents a few ideas. Use one of these or develop your own, considering how this affects your appearance and the way you cast your spells. Your unique style doesn't have to change any of the default rules associated with your magic. For example, you may say that you're working with principles of mundane science, but your spells will still be negated by {@spell counterspell}. Find creative ways to explain how your character's techniques interact with game rules. Perhaps some of your theories are completely false; while you believe that you're producing magical effects by talking to spirits or using Thelanian logic, it's possible you've stumbled on a different way to trigger traditional arcane reactions. If you want to explore mechanical advantages and limitations based on your unusual techniques, discuss it with your DM.": "{@table Artificer Techniques|ExploringEberron}表提出了一些想法。使用其中一个或开发你自己的，考虑这对你的外表和你施法的方式有什么影响。你的独特风格不必改变任何与你的魔法相关的默认规则。例如，你可以说你使用的是世俗科学的原理，但你的法术仍然会被（%1%）所否定。找到创造性的方法来解释你的角色的技术如何与游戏规则互动。也许你的一些理论是完全错误的；虽然你相信你是通过与神灵对话或使用Thelanian逻辑来产生魔法效果的，但你有可能偶然发现了一种不同的方法来触发传统的奥术反应。如果你想探索基于你的不寻常技术的机械优势和限制，请与你的管理员讨论。",
	"When you cast an artificer spell, you follow the same rules as other spellcasters—but what are you {@i doing} when you use your action to produce a magical effect? You aren't praying for divine intervention, invoking a supernatural patron, or producing a fireball with words and gestures. To cast spells, you must be holding a tool you're proficient with—why? Because you're using that tool and its associated skills to produce magical effects. If you're using alchemist's supplies to cast {@spell cure wounds}, you aren't just poking someone with a beaker; you're mixing a healing salve.": "当你施展工匠法术时，你遵循与其他施法者相同的规则--但当你用你的行动产生魔法效果时，你是什么（%0%）？你不是在祈祷神灵的干预，召唤超自然的守护者，或者用语言和手势产生一个火球。要施展法术，你必须拿着一个你精通的工具--为什么？因为你要使用那个工具及其相关技能来产生魔法效果。如果你使用炼金术士的用品来施展（%1%），你不仅仅是在用烧杯戳人；你是在混合治疗药水。",
	"Think about what your tools actually are. Artisan's tools are an abstract concept—10 pounds of assorted objects and supplies, not just a singular tool. You may have a satchel holding them or a bandolier of pouches. If you use {@item tinker's tools|PHB} to create an effect, what specific tools are you using, and how? Some of the most common tools of artifice are discussed below, but you can cast spells using any artisan's tool you're familiar with. You could even perform your alchemy using {@item brewer's supplies|PHB} or {@item cook's utensils|PHB}; why drink a potion when you could eat a magical pie?": "想一想你的工具究竟是什么。工匠的工具是一个抽象的概念--10磅重的各种物品和用品，而不只是一个单一的工具。你可能有一个装着它们的挎包或一个带状的小包。如果你使用（%0%）来创造一个效果，你使用什么具体的工具，以及如何使用？下面将讨论一些最常见的工匠工具，但你可以使用任何你熟悉的工匠工具来施法。你甚至可以用{@item brewer's supplies|PHB}或{@item cook's utensils|PHB}来执行你的炼金术；当你可以吃一个神奇的馅饼时，为什么要喝药水？",
	"The challenge of creating an alchemical potion is in suspending the mystical chemical reaction for later consumption. It's much easier to trigger an instant effect, and that's what you're doing when you cast your spells. Your {@spell fire bolt} could be a thrown flask, {@spell poison spray} is flinging foul substances. {@spell Cure wounds}, {@spell false life}, and {@spell water breathing} could be potions you mix and serve on the spot. {@spell Disguise self} or {@spell alter self} could be magical cosmetics.": "制造炼金术药水的挑战在于暂停神秘的化学反应，以便以后服用。触发即时效果要容易得多，而这正是你施法时要做的。你的{@spell fire bolt}可能是抛出的酒壶，{@spell poison spray}是抛出的污秽物质。{@spell Cure wounds}、{@spell false life}和{@spell water breathing}可能是你当场混合并提供的药水。{@spell Disguise self}或{@spell alter self}可能是神奇的化妆品。",
	"Sigilry channels arcane power through symbols and sound, using special inks and techniques. As with alchemy, it's much easier to produce an instant effect than to suspend and sustain it as a scroll. When you cast {@spell fire bolt}, perhaps you use your quill to trace the name of fire in the air before you; or you might have the sigil written down and you just read it to produce the effect. Whether you draw sigils onto things or craft simple scrolls and read them, your pen is mightier than most swords.": "Sigilry通过符号和声音引导奥术力量，使用特殊的墨水和技术。就像炼金术一样，产生一个即时效果要比把它作为一个卷轴来悬挂和维持要容易得多。当你施展（%0%）时，也许你用你的羽毛笔在你面前的空气中描画出火的名字；或者你可能已经写下了符号，你只要读出它就能产生效果。无论你是在东西上画符咒，还是制作简单的卷轴并阅读它们，你的笔都比大多数剑更有力量。",
	"This is a twist on the sigilist, and you could use your tools in the same way, drawing arcane glyphs. Or, more exotically, you could specialize in calculating ley lines and the relationships between the planes. The world is filled with micro-manifest zones waiting to be triggered; you're using your tools to calculate the proper alignments to channel the planar energies you need.": "这是对符咒师的一种转折，你可以用同样的方式使用你的工具，画出神秘的字形。或者，更奇特的是，你可以专门计算雷线和各平面之间的关系。这个世界充满了等待触发的微观显现区；你用你的工具来计算适当的排列以引导你需要的平面能量。",
	"If you want to be fanciful about it, you could paint what you need into reality. When you cure wounds, you're literally painting over the injury; when you cast {@spell fire bolt}, you paint the flame in the air and it flies toward your opponent. This is a variation of sigilry, but the same underlying principles apply. You might even create scrolls that are images rather than words.": "如果你想胡思乱想，你可以把你需要的东西画成现实。当你治疗伤口时，你实际上是在伤处涂抹；当你施放（%0%）时，你在空中涂抹火焰，它飞向你的对手。这是圣痕术的一种变体，但同样的基本原则也适用。你甚至可以创建图像而非文字的卷轴。",
	"Artificers are proficient with both thieves' tools and tinker's tools, and you use them in similar ways. Thieves' tools include picks and other fine manipulators. You don't cast a {@spell fire bolt} by pointing a lockpick at someone; but you could use it to clear a problematic valve on a dragon-pistol you made with tinker's tools.": "工匠精通盗贼的工具和工匠的工具，你们使用它们的方式也类似。盗贼的工具包括镐和其他精细的操纵器。你不能用锁匙指着别人来施放（%0%）；但你可以用它来清除你用工匠工具制造的龙枪上有问题的阀门。",
	"You can justify all manner of odd gadgets with tinker's tools, putting together a prototype that becomes part of your toolkit. A dragon-shaped sidearm could produce {@spell fire bolt} or a modified gauntlet could deliver {@spell shocking grasp}. These unstable prototypes can't be used by anyone else, needing constant tinkering to keep them working. So you always carry your tools, and to cast a spell, a \"tool\" must be in hand—but it can be a dragon-gun, as opposed to pliers. You might cast {@spell cure wounds} using a tiny metal spider you've tinkered; while it looks like a mundane clockwork construct, magic lets it move and think. Mundane engineering is part of a tinker's creations, but magic makes them work.": "你可以用工匠的工具来证明各种古怪的小玩意，把一个原型放在一起，成为你工具包的一部分。一个龙形挎包可以产生（%0%），或者一个改良的铠甲可以提供（%1%）。这些不稳定的原型不能被其他人使用，需要不断修补以保持它们的工作。所以你总是带着你的工具，为了施法，必须有一个 \"工具 \"在手--但它可以是一把龙枪，而不是钳子。你可能会用你修补过的一只小金属蜘蛛来施展（2%）；虽然它看起来像一个世俗的发条结构，但魔法让它移动和思考。世俗的工程是工匠创作的一部分，但魔法使它们发挥作用。",
	"Wands, staffs, and rods are some of the most basic forms of arcane focus. If you perform magic with woodcarver's tools, you aren't actually blasting someone with a saw. Instead, you are using experimental, exotic, or temporary wands or rods. As with tinker's tools, you have to have a tool in your hand and you have to possess woodcarver's tools to perform your magic, but the exact nature of which tool is in your hand is up to you. It could appear to be a traditional wand, or you could have come up with a new revolutionary form of wand, staff, or rod.": "魔杖、法杖和棒子是一些最基本的奥术专注形式。如果你用木匠的工具施展魔法，你并不是真的用锯子轰击别人。相反，你使用的是实验性的、异国的或临时的魔杖或魔棒。和工匠的工具一样，你手中必须有一个工具，你必须拥有木匠的工具才能施展你的魔法，但你手中的工具的确切性质由你决定。它可能看起来是一根传统的魔杖，也可能是你想出了一种新的革命性的魔杖、法杖或棍子的形式。",
	"As an artificer, you prepare spells during a long rest, but it's not like a wizard reading a book. It's about assembling the specialized supplies and tools you need for the things you want to do. A sigilist can't create a scroll with just any ink, but has entirely different inks based on the type of effects they're going to produce. Likewise, an alchemist prepares special reagents that combine to produce spell effects. If you use tinker's tools, you're creating and fine-tuning your gadgets. You can't create a dragon-pistol in six seconds; you prepare the pistol during your rest, and when you cast a spell, you're simply loading enchanted ammunition or triggering the arcane sigils you set in place.": "作为一个工匠，你在长时间的休息中准备法术，但这并不像巫师读一本书。它是关于为你想做的事情组装你所需要的专门用品和工具。一个符咒师不能用任何墨水来制作卷轴，而是根据他们要产生的效果类型，拥有完全不同的墨水。同样地，炼金术士准备特殊的试剂，结合起来产生法术效果。如果你使用工匠的工具，你就在创造和微调你的小玩意。你不可能在六秒钟内创造出一把龙枪；你在休息时准备好手枪，而当你施法时，你只是在装入附魔的弹药或触发你设置的奥术符号。",
	"This also explains the idea of spell slots. The reagents you've prepared are tricky to produce and don't last forever. You're preparing as much as you can, but once you go through all your mystic inks, you can't produce another scroll effect until you have a few hours to work on it. Effectively, your spells use temporary magic items that only you can use, created during a long rest.": "这也解释了法术槽的概念。你准备的试剂生产起来很棘手，而且不会永远存在。你尽可能多地准备，但一旦你用完了所有的神秘墨水，你就无法产生另一个卷轴效果，直到你有几个小时的时间来研究它。实际上，你的法术使用的是只有你才能使用的临时魔法物品，是在长时间休息时产生的。",
	"Meanwhile, infusions allow you to create longer-lasting tools that you can share with your companions. Artificers create magic items, but to maintain class balance, you can't flood the party with them; it's up to you what you do with this limited resource.": "同时，灌注允许你创造更持久的工具，并与你的同伴分享。工匠创造了魔法物品，但为了保持等级平衡，你不能让它们充斥整个队伍；如何利用这一有限的资源取决于你。",
	"Artillerists produce eldritch cannons and arcane firearms. Battle Smiths make steel defenders. Any artificer can craft a homunculus companion. But what are these? Are Artillerists wielding guns like those of our own world? Not necessarily.": "炮手生产长生火炮和奥术火器。战斗技师制造钢铁防御者。任何工匠都可以制作一个同体人伴侣。但这些是什么？炮手们挥舞的枪支和我们自己的世界一样吗？不一定。",
	"These items are \"arcane\" and \"eldritch.\" Much as the primary form of arcane artillery is the {@item siege staff|ExploringEberron}, the Artillerist uses woodcarver's tools, turning \"a rod, staff, or wand into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.\" So you're a specialized wandslinger with improved wands, staffs, and rods. You choose their appearance—a wand, a specialized hand crossbow, a flintlock pistol, a tiny metal dragon, or any aesthetic you like. \"Arcane firearm\" doesn't necessarily mean \"handgun.\"": "这些物品是 \"奥术的 \"和 \"长生的\"。就像奥术火炮的主要形式是{@item siege staff|ExploringEberron}一样，炮手使用木雕工具，将 \"棒子、法杖或魔杖变成奥术火器，成为你破坏性法术的管道。\" 所以你是一个专门的巫师，拥有改良的魔杖、法杖和棒子。你可以选择它们的外观--一根魔杖、一把专门的手弩、一把燧发枪、一条小金属龙，或者任何你喜欢的审美。\"奥术火器 \"并不一定意味着 \"手枪\"。",
	"While the name \"eldritch cannon\" sounds like a massive piece of artillery, an eldritch cannon is either small or tiny, possibly small enough to hold in your hand. What does it look like, and does it have legs? Is it an animated ballista? A small siege staff? A tiny brass dragon that breathes fire on your enemies?": "虽然 \"长生大炮 \"这个名字听起来像是一件巨大的火炮，但长生大炮要么很小，要么很小，可能小到可以拿在手里。它是什么样子的，它有腿吗？它是动画弹弓吗？一个小型攻城杖？一条对敌人喷火的小铜龙？",
	"The same principle applies to a homunculi's appearance. Consider your style and the tools that you use for your magic. Your homunculus servant can deliver your touch spells, but how? If you use painter's supplies to perform your magic, your homunculus could be a tiny humanoid paintbrush, a floating palette, or even a creature made out of living paint. An alchemist's homunculus could be a tiny cauldron or a little humanoid creature made from glass and beakers.": "同样的原则也适用于同体人的外观。考虑到你的风格和你用来施展魔法的工具。你的同体人仆人可以传递你的触摸法术，但如何传递？如果你使用画家的用品来施展你的魔法，你的同体人可以是一个小小的人形画笔，一个漂浮的调色板，甚至是一个由活的颜料制成的生物。炼金术士的同形体可以是一个小小的大锅，或者一个由玻璃和烧杯制成的小人形生物。",
	"Through all of these, the mechanics don't change. The shape of your arcane firearm makes no difference in combat rules; what it changes is the story that you're telling. What's interesting about your artificer? What does your homunculus say about you?": "通过所有这些，机制并没有改变。你的奥术火器的形状在战斗规则中没有区别；它所改变的是你所讲述的故事。你的工匠有什么有趣的地方？你的同体人对你有什么说法？",
	"You've developed your style and chosen your tools. But how and where did you develop your skills? Do you have a connection to an established order of artificers? Consider these ways your background could reflect your experience as an artificer.": "你已经形成了自己的风格，选择了自己的工具。但你是如何以及在哪里发展你的技能的？你是否与某个既定的工匠组织有联系？考虑一下你的背景可以反映你作为工匠的经验。",
	"You worked your way up in House Cannith or the Arcane Congress, studying at a trade school and working in an industrial forgehold. While you've abandoned the factory in favor of adventure, you still have strong ties in the Fabricator's Guild.": "你在坎尼斯家族或奥术大会中一路走来，在贸易学校学习，在工业锻造厂工作。虽然你已经放弃了工厂而选择了冒险，但你在制造者公会仍有很强的联系。",
	"You operated and maintained the engines of war. What nation did you serve? Are you proud of your service, or haunted by your deeds? Did you serve and retire with distinction—or are you a folk hero who deserted to help innocents?": "你们操作和维护战争的引擎。你为哪个国家服务？你是为你的服务感到骄傲，还是为你的事迹感到困扰？你是否服役并出色地退役，或者你是为帮助无辜者而开小差的民间英雄？",
	"You don't do well with authority. You may have started with Arcanix or the Twelve, but you were thrown out after challenging the system one too many times. You're brilliant—but determined to find your own path.": "你不善于与权威打交道。你可能已经开始在Arcanix或12人组织工作，但你在挑战系统太多次后被赶了出来。你很聪明，但决心要找到自己的道路。",
	"You've never studied arcane science, but you have an intuitive talent for artifice. Perhaps you grew up on battlefields, scavenging parts from warforged titans or shattered floating fortresses. Your work isn't pretty—and often seems like it {@i shouldn't} work—yet you can do things no magewright can match.": "你从未学习过神秘的科学，但你对制造有一种直觉上的天赋。也许你是在战场上长大的，从被战争锻造的泰坦巨人或破碎的浮动堡垒上搜刮零件。你的工作并不漂亮，而且经常看起来像（%0%）工作，但你能做到任何魔法师都无法比拟的事情。",
	"You provided arcane assistance to an organization operating out of the public eye. Did you serve with the Royal Eyes of Aundair or the King's Citadel of Breland, crafting common items for agents? Or was it a shadier operation like the Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan? Why did you shift to a life of adventure? What pieces of your old life could come back to haunt you?": "你为一个在公众视野之外运作的组织提供了奥术援助。你是否为昂代尔的皇家之眼或布雷兰德的国王城堡服务，为代理人制作普通物品？还是像博洛玛家族或塔卡南家族那样的阴暗行动？你为什么会转向冒险生活？你以前的生活中有哪些片段会回来纠缠你？",
	"If you're a guild artisan, what guild did you work with? When you buy a {@item wand of magic missiles} in Sharn, who made it?

	"Throughout the golden age of Galifar, the Arcane Congress delved into magical mysteries for the good of all. Today, it only serves the people of Aundair, yet remains the largest institute of both wizardry and artifice outside of House Cannith. The Arcane Congress was largely devoted to the war effort, but it has also continued to develop common magic items and other magical tools to improve the daily life of people in Aundair.": "在整个加利法尔的黄金时代，奥术大会为了所有人的利益而深入研究魔法的奥秘。今天，它只为昂代尔的人民服务，但仍然是坎尼斯家族之外最大的巫术和人工制品研究所。奥术大会主要致力于战争，但它也继续开发普通魔法物品和其他魔法工具，以改善昂代尔人的日常生活。",

	"House Cannith is the single largest source of artifice in the Five Nations, providing training through its trade schools and employing magewrights and artificers in its factories and forgeholds. The Fabricator's Guild creates both magical and mundane goods, while the loosely organized Tinker's Guild focuses on maintenance and repair. While Cannith has a broad range of expertise, Cannith West in Aundair excels at alchemy, Cannith South in Breland has the edge in general industry, and Cannith East specializes in artillery and dabbles in necromancy.": "坎尼斯家族是五国中最大的人工制品来源，通过其贸易学校提供培训，并在其工厂和锻造厂雇佣魔法师和工匠。制造者行会创造魔法和世俗的物品，而组织松散的修补者行会则专注于维护和修理。虽然坎尼斯拥有广泛的专业知识，但位于昂代尔的西坎尼斯擅长炼金术，位于布雷兰的南坎尼斯在一般工业方面具有优势，而东坎尼斯则专门从事火炮并涉足死灵法术。",

	"Every nation employed enhanced and arcane artillery in the war, along with battle magic. While most relied heavily on House Cannith, every nation has its own program researching military applications of magic, along with a corps of magewrights trained to operate artillery.

	"In a parallel to the cults of the Traveler, this secret order of magewrights and artificers believe they're directly inspired by the Sovereign Onatar. Members can be found scattered throughout the other organizations in this section. Onatar's Chosen believe that artifice should serve the greater good, and they seek to drive their organizations toward such positive purposes.": "与旅行者的邪教平行，这个由魔法师和工匠组成的秘密组织相信他们直接受到奥纳塔君主的启发。成员可以在本节的其他组织中找到。奥纳塔的神选者相信，工匠应该为更大的利益服务，他们试图推动他们的组织朝着这样的积极目的前进。",

	"These cults are a dark reflection of Onatar's Chosen. Followers of the Traveler are found in most organizations in this section, with a strong presence in House Cannith. Traveler cultists pursue innovation at all costs, creating weapons or tools that could shatter the existing balance of power or cause chaos in other ways. Some outsiders believe airships (which cause strife between Orien and Lyrandar) and warforged may been created by these cultists—and many blame the Traveler for the Mourning.": "这些邪教是奥纳塔的神选者的黑暗反映。旅行者的追随者在这部分的大多数组织中都能找到，在坎尼斯家族中的存在感很强。旅行者崇拜者不惜一切代价追求创新，创造出可以打破现有权力平衡的武器或工具，或以其他方式造成混乱。一些外人认为飞艇（导致奥瑞恩和利兰达之间的纷争）和战争锻造者可能是由这些邪教徒创造的--许多人将哀悼归咎于旅行者。",

	"Changelings are spread across Khorvaire and Sarlona. They can interbreed with many other humanoid species, and the offspring of such a union will either be changeling or the other species—there are no \"half-changelings.\" So just as you can be a Brelish elf with no ties to Aerenal, you can be a changeling with no connection to any changeling culture or community. There are changeling students in Arcanix and Morgrave, changeling agents in the King's Citadel and the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and any number of changelings devoted to the nations they call home. So you don't {@i need} deep cultural ties to play a changeling character, but if you want to explore a connection to your changeling roots, here are a few ideas.": "变种人分布在霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳。他们可以与许多其他类人物种杂交，这种结合的后代要么是变种人，要么是其他物种，没有 \"半变种人\"。因此，正如你可以成为一个与Aerenal没有关系的Brelish精灵，你也可以成为一个与任何changeling文化或社区没有关系的changeling。在阿卡尼克斯和莫格雷夫有变种人学生，在国王城堡和阿恩代尔的皇家之眼有变种人特工，还有任何数量的变种人致力于他们称之为家园的国家。所以你不{@i need}有很深的文化联系来扮演一个变种人角色，但如果你想探索与你的变种人根的联系，这里有几个想法。",
	"Nomadic changelings are often referred to as \"travelers,\" a name referencing both to their wandering lifestyle as well as the Traveler of the Dark Six—who, legend holds, gave them the ability to change their form, and whose chaotic nature is echoed in the lives of many travelers today.": "游牧的变身者通常被称为 \"旅行者\"，这个名字既指他们的流浪生活方式，也指黑暗六人组的旅行者--传说是他给了他们改变形态的能力，而他的混乱本质在今天许多旅行者的生活中得到了回应。",
	"The oldest traveler tradition is that of the Children of Jes. Inspired by the Traveler, the Children follow migratory patterns that slowly evolve, keeping them from becoming too predictable to outsiders. Many travel in small groups—a troupe of entertainers, a merchant convoy, a stagecoach of exotic travelers. Others prefer to travel alone. Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.": "最古老的旅行者传统是杰斯之子的传统。受旅行者的启发，孩子们遵循缓慢发展的迁徙模式，使他们不至于对外人来说变得太容易预测。许多人以小团体的形式旅行--艺人的剧团、商人的车队、异国旅行者的马车。其他人则喜欢独自旅行。无论怎样，他们相信变化的重要性，在他们的流浪过程中扮演着许多角色。工匠、吟游诗人、信使和牧师是常见的角色，而变种人很可能在他们的行业中相当有天赋。旅行者牧师可以在早上向主人布道，在晚上带领火焰之歌。由于隐藏了他们真正的变种人本性，孩子们通常对他们周围的人来说是看不见的；他们使用一种秘密的纹身和伤疤语言来识别彼此，同时还有一套共同的角色。",
	"Few people in the Five Nations understand the culture and values held by changeling travelers. Some are unnerved by the concept of a hidden culture, that a stranger might not be the human or hobgoblin they appear to be. Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to \"obtain\" another's possessions as long as they're replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler's blessing is their license to prey on the \"single-skins\"—a term for races lacking the changeling gift for shapeshifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people—whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid—though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shapeshifting abilities and nomadic preferences.": "五国中很少有人理解变种人的文化和价值观。有些人对隐秘文化的概念感到不安，认为陌生人可能不是他们表面上的人类或妖精。其他人则认为，由于变种人拥有随意改变面孔的不可思议的能力，他们会利用这种能力达到邪恶的目的，在继续前进之前欺骗诚实的人。变形人的传统早于加利法尔和它的法律，事实上，有些人认为 \"获得 \"他人的财产是公平的，只要用同等价值的礼物来代替。一些旅行者声称，旅行者的祝福是他们掠夺 \"单皮 \"的许可--这是一个对缺乏变身天赋的种族的称呼。然而，旅行者并不比任何其他人更天生不诚实--无论是龙纹继承人还是守门人德鲁伊--尽管那些尊重当地习俗的人仍然会因为他们的变身能力和游牧偏好而受到很多怀疑。",
	"As a player character, the changeling traveler background presented in chapter 6 can allow you to be part of a secretive network of changelings spread across the nation. As a DM, you could present the Children as a stereotypical source of thieves and charlatans. But they could be more enigmatic—an unexpected ally that can appear almost anywhere.": "作为一个玩家角色，第6章中介绍的变种人旅行者背景可以让你成为遍布全国的变种人秘密网络的一部分。作为管理人，你可以将变异人呈现为盗贼和骗子的典型来源。但他们也可以更加神秘--一个几乎可以出现在任何地方的意外盟友。",
	"Under the rule of Galifar, many changelings chose to emerge from the shadows and live in the open, and today they can be found in most major cities of the Five Nations. Changelings in stable communities—such as Dragoneyes in Sharn or the Blackleaf district of Wroat—rarely hide their true nature. This allows them to sell their services openly and to pursue careers that make use of their unique talents, as explored in the \"Changeling Careers\" sidebar. However, many still make use of shared personas, and outsiders can be confused by the changelings' fluid relationship with identity. Settled changelings don't face the same level of prejudice as travelers, but there are still many single-skins who believe no changeling can be trusted.": "在加利法尔的统治下，许多变种人选择从阴影中走出来，生活在公开场合，如今他们可以在五国的大多数主要城市找到。稳定社区中的变种人--如沙恩的龙眼（Dragoneyes）或沃洛特的黑叶区--很少隐藏他们的真实本性。这使他们能够公开出售自己的服务，并从事能够利用其独特才能的职业，正如 \"变种人职业 \"侧栏中所探讨的那样。然而，许多人仍在使用共同的角色，外人可能会被变种人与身份的流动关系所迷惑。定居的变种人不会像旅行者那样面临同样程度的偏见，但仍有许多单皮人认为没有变种人可以信任。",
	"In addition to changeling neighborhoods in the cities of the Five Nations, there are two unique changeling cultures. The Gray Tide principality of the Lhazaar Principalities is a nation of changelings with a strong mercantile tradition; some say that the Gray Tide engages in a great deal of piracy, using their shapeshifting gifts to shift the blame to other princes. In Droaam, changelings are said to have a stronghold in the city of Lost. However, no outsider knows the location of Lost, and it's said that the city itself is alive, and can freely move and change its shape. Regardless, the changelings of Lost have been strong allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell, and changelings can be found serving Daask.": "除了五国城市中的变种人社区外，还有两种独特的变种人文化。拉扎尔公国的灰潮公国是一个拥有强大商业传统的变种人国家；有人说灰潮公国从事大量的海盗活动，利用他们的变身天赋将责任推给其他公国。在德罗阿姆，据说变革者在迷失之城有一个据点。然而，没有外人知道失落城的位置，据说这座城市本身是有生命的，可以自由移动和改变形状。不管怎么说，迷失之城的变化者一直是索拉-凯尔之女的强大盟友，而且可以发现变化者为达斯克服务。",
	"As a player character, a stable background gives you a place to call home and allows you to be open about your true nature. As a DM, a changeling community can be an interesting backdrop for an adventure or an easy place to find changeling services.": "作为一个玩家角色，一个稳定的背景给了你一个可以称之为家的地方，让你可以公开你的真实本性。作为DM，一个变种人社区可以成为一个有趣的冒险背景，或者一个容易找到变种人服务的地方。",
	"People often think of the shapeshifting talents of the changeling as a tool for deception. But in places where changelings live openly, including Droaam and the major cities of the Five Nations, there are many practical uses for shapeshifting. Changelings have long dominated the industry of paid companionship, using their talents to fulfill fantasies. While this can be sexual, there are many other changeling companions who specialize in giving a client the opportunity to have a meal or conversation with a distant loved one, or to practice a difficult conversation with a changeling stand-in. Many artists use changelings as versatile models. Changelings can also often be found as beauticians; in addition to possessing a deep understanding of the shifting nature of appearance, a changeling can use their own form as a palette on which to perfect the look a client is aiming for.": "人们通常认为变种人的变身才能是一种欺骗的工具。但在变种人公开生活的地方，包括德拉姆和五国的主要城市，变身有许多实际用途。长期以来，变种人一直主导着有偿陪伴的行业，利用他们的才能来满足人们的幻想。虽然这可以是性方面的，但也有许多其他的变身人伴侣，他们专门给客户提供与远方亲人吃饭或谈话的机会，或与变身人的替身练习困难的谈话。许多艺术家使用变身人作为多功能的模特。变种人也经常被发现是美容师；除了对外观的变化性质有深刻的理解外，变种人还可以用自己的外形作为调色板，在上面完善客户所要的外观。",
	"Impersonation is also a viable career. Do you need to be in two places at once? Do you want a local celebrity to appear at your child's birthday party? Hire a changeling impersonator. The Defender's Guild of House Deneith has recently begun training and licensing elite changeling bodyguards, capable of serving as body doubles or posing as harmless bystanders until needed.": "冒充也是一个可行的职业。你需要同时出现在两个地方吗？你想让当地名人出现在你孩子的生日聚会上吗？雇佣一个变种人的模仿者吧。迪尼斯家族的卫士公会最近开始培训和许可精英变种人保镖，他们能够充当替身，或者在需要时冒充无害的旁观者。",
	"Many changelings pursue a career in entertainment. After all, a changeling with the proper {@item shiftweave|ERLW} outfit can play five roles! However, House Thuranni and House Phiarlan have been accused of denying opportunities to changelings. In licensed Phiarlan companies, changelings are typically relegated to serving as understudies and stunt doubles for dragonmarked superstars.": "许多变种人追求娱乐事业。毕竟，一个拥有适当（%0%）装备的变种人可以扮演五个角色！但是，瑟兰尼家族和菲亚兰家族被指责为剥夺了变种人的机会。然而，瑟兰尼家族和菲亚尔兰家族一直被指责为拒绝给变种人提供机会。在获得许可的Phiarlan公司中，变种人通常被降级为龙纹超级明星的替身和特技替身。",
	"While changelings are well represented in the major cities, there are many villages and towns where they're treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a passer, you've crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You may live your entire life as a human warrior or an elf priest, engaging your shapeshifting abilities only as a last resort.": "虽然变种人在主要城市有很好的代表性，但在许多村庄和城镇，他们受到恐惧和怀疑的对待。你可能出生在这样一个社区，甚至可能从未认识过其他的变种人。作为一个通行者，你已经精心设计了一个单一的身份，你认为这是你的真实面目。你可能一生都在以人类战士或精灵牧师的身份生活，只有在不得已的情况下才使用你的变身能力。",
	"If you grew up as a passer, how do you live today? Do you want to learn more about other changeling cultures, or do you deny any connection to other changelings? Do you acknowledge your changeling nature, or do you consider your passer identity to be your true self?

	"Passer can be an interesting choice for an urchin, outlander, or a changeling who's lived through oppression and is only now coming to understand their true nature.

	"Changelings are as diverse as any other species, presenting many other cultures and paths you could explore. {@i Reality seekers} are settled changelings who prefer their natural form and avoid deception, instead searching for the ultimate truth. {@i Becomers} actively seek to live many lives in order to more fully understand the experiences of others. The Cabinet of Faces is a secret society devoted to the Traveler, and its members actively seek to challenge traditions and cause chaos. Do you have ties to any of these movements?": "变种人和其他物种一样多样化，呈现出许多其他文化和路径，你可以探索。{@i Reality seekers}是定居的变化者，他们喜欢他们的自然形态，避免欺骗，而是寻找最终的真相。{@i Becomers}积极寻求过多种生活，以便更充分地了解他人的经历。面孔内阁是一个致力于旅行者的秘密社团，其成员积极寻求挑战传统并造成混乱。你与这些运动中的任何一个有关系吗？",
	"For a changeling, an identity is like a set of clothes. Within a changeling community, a persona may serve the same role a badge of office or uniform would for a human. The local priest is Father Hes. The sheriff is Big Dol. The healer is Lela. Whoever takes on the job assumes that persona. There may be three different priests, but whoever is currently on duty assumes the identity of Hes. In part, this is visual, but it's also about adopting a personality—not just looking like Father Hes, but {@i becoming} Father Hes, giving the people a sense of continuity.": "对于一个变种人来说，身份就像一套衣服。在一个变种人社区里，一个角色的作用可能与人类的办公徽章或制服的作用相同。当地的牧师是Hes神父。警长是大多尔。治疗师是Lela。不管是谁担任这个工作，都要扮演这个角色。可能有三个不同的牧师，但目前正在值班的人都是Hes的身份。在某种程度上，这是视觉上的，但它也是关于采用一种个性--不仅仅是看起来像赫斯神父，而是（%0%）赫斯神父，给人们一种连续性的感觉。",
	"This is especially important for the traveling clans. Travelers use well-established personas as anchors in potentially hostile communities. A trusted merchant, a beloved storyteller, or a reliable mercenary—any traveler can use one of these established personas to ensure a warm welcome. Of course, when using an established persona, it's up to you to preserve its reputation. If you're exposed as a changeling or if you ruin the reputation of the persona, you're destroying a valuable tool.": "这对旅行者的家族来说尤其重要。旅行者在潜在的敌对社区中使用成熟的角色作为锚。一个值得信赖的商人，一个受人喜爱的说书人，或者一个可靠的雇佣兵--任何旅行者都可以使用这些既定的角色之一来确保受到热烈欢迎。当然，当你使用一个既定的角色时，你应该保护它的声誉。如果你被暴露为变种人，或者你破坏了这个角色的声誉，你就会毁掉一个有价值的工具。",
	"Many changelings develop their own unique personas. If you're a fighter with proficiency in the violin, you might use a grim half-orc form in combat and an elegant elf when you play the violin. You're not required to use a persona—the violinist could fight in their elf form—but the persona can serve as a way to focus on that particular skill. The {@feat Focused Personas|ExploringEberron} feat in chapter 6 provides a concrete reflection of this.": "许多变身者发展出他们自己独特的角色。如果你是一个精通小提琴的战士，你可能在战斗中使用狰狞的半兽人形态，而在拉小提琴时使用优雅的精灵形态。你不需要使用角色--小提琴手可以用他们的精灵形态战斗--但是角色可以作为专注于该特定技能的一种方式。第6章中的{@feat Focused Personas|ExploringEberron}壮举就具体反映了这一点。",
	"You could create a character of any class and background who just happens to be a changeling—or you can create a character whose concept is integrally tied to your identity as a changeling. Chapter 6 presents a changeling traveler background, three racial feats, and a Living Weapon monk subclass that blends shapechanging with martial discipline. However, you can have an equally interesting story with a character of any background or class, instead adjusting the \"fluff\"—the cosmetic details or backstory of a class—to fit an idea.

As an Aereni elf, you aren't expected to {@i improve} your society; your task is to prove yourself worthy of it and to earn your afterlife.": "作为Aereni的一员，你走的路与Khorvaire的人不同。你出生在一个由古老而强大的神灵守护和引导的领域。你从那些几千年前就已经死去的老师那里学到了教训，你知道即使是摆在你面前的几个世纪的生活也只是你灵魂旅程的开始。你们的人民拥有昂代尔无法掌握的奥秘知识；不死阁的祭司们拥有只有火焰守护者才能比拟的力量。你们来自一个充满奇迹的国度，一个由神圣力量引导的领域。简而言之，你们的人民已经达到了完美的境界。作为一个Aereni精灵，你并不被期望{@i improve}你的社会；你的任务是证明自己配得上它，并赢得你的来世。",
	"Aereni elves have a reputation for being arrogant and condescending. Why wouldn't you be? Humans are like children to you, with their short lives and desperation to do things quickly regardless of the quality of their efforts. Even the elves that settled in Khorvaire have abandoned the traditions of their ancestors and their blessed homeland. It's easy to be smug... but who wants that character around? An Aereni elf doesn't have to be unpleasant. As one of the Aereni, you are a traveler from a mysterious and magical kingdom. You possess ancient wisdom and a tie to divine spirits. Beyond that, the Undying Court is one of the few forces in the world that has a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy. Have you come to Khorvaire as an emissary of the Undying Court, whether as a diplomat or an agent of prophecy? Are you working on behalf of a noble family, pursuing mercantile interests, or seeking an artifact stolen from your people long ago? Are you an anthropologist fascinated by the behavior of humanity? Are you a paladin in the service of the Deathguard, charged to exterminate undead wherever they can be found? Or are you an exile, driven from your homeland and forced to live among the barbarians?": "Aereni精灵以傲慢和居高临下而闻名。你为什么不呢？人类对你来说就像孩子，他们生命短暂，不顾一切地快速做事，不顾他们的努力质量。即使是定居在霍尔韦尔的精灵，也放弃了他们祖先的传统和他们受祝福的故乡。自鸣得意很容易......但谁想让这种性格在身边呢？一个Aereni精灵不一定是不讨人喜欢的。作为艾瑞尼人的一员，你是一个来自神秘而神奇的王国的旅行者。你拥有古老的智慧和与神灵的联系。除此之外，不死阁是世界上为数不多的能瞥见德拉贡预言的力量之一。你是作为不死阁的使者来到霍尔韦尔，无论是作为外交官还是预言的代理人？你是代表一个贵族家庭工作，追求商业利益，还是在寻找很久以前从你的人民那里偷走的文物？你是一个对人类行为着迷的人类学家吗？你是一名为死亡守卫服务的圣骑士，负责在任何地方消灭亡灵？或者你是一个流亡者，被赶出你的家园，被迫生活在野蛮人中间？",
	"Whether you play an Aereni character or encounter them as NPCs, this section provides insight into the land of the elves. In addition, chapter 6 presents a feat and subrace for Aereni elves.": "无论你是扮演Aereni角色还是作为NPC遇到他们，本节都提供了对精灵土地的深入了解。此外，第6章介绍了Aereni精灵的特技和亚种族。",
	"Aerenal is an isolated nation with little interest in the outside world. They have little fear of conquest; the divine power of the Undying Court has repelled assaults by legions of dragons. But the power of the Undying Court doesn't extend beyond Aerenal, and the elves have chosen to remain in their haven rather than to expand across the world. From this island sanctuary, they have seen the Empire of Dhakaan rise and fall, and they expect to be around long after the Five Nations have fallen to dust. Here are a few more important things to know about Aerenal.": "Aerenal是一个与世隔绝的国家，对外部世界没有什么兴趣。他们几乎不惧怕征服；不死阁的神圣力量已经击退了龙族军团的进攻。但是，不死阁的力量并没有延伸到艾瑞纳之外，精灵们选择留在他们的避难所，而不是向全世界扩张。从这个岛屿上的避难所，他们见证了达卡安帝国的兴衰，他们期望在五国沦为尘埃之后还能长期存在。以下是关于Aerenal的一些更重要的事情。",
	"Aerenal is ruled by the living. The Sibling Kings lead the nation from Shae Cairdal, and the high priests and lords of the lines are mortal elves. But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to {@i spirit idols}, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These sprits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.": "Aerenal是由活人统治的。兄弟姐妹国王从沙伊-凯尔达尔领导这个国家，大祭司和各系领主是凡人精灵。但死者引导并保护着生者。当杰出的精灵死亡时，他们会被保存到死后。大多数人被绑在{@i spirit idols}，保存灵魂的雕像上，并防止其在Dolurrh解体。但也有一些人被养成了无死之身，类似于木乃伊的亡灵，但由正能量维持。没有死亡的士兵守卫着地下墓穴和神庙，没有死亡的圣人和顾问与他们的后代分享他们的知识和智慧。随着时间的推移，没有死亡的人可以上升到一个更伟大的境界，成为几乎不需要身体的纯粹精神的生命。这些被称为 \"升天议员 \"的精灵居住在伟大的城市Shae Mordai，当他们的精神在一个神秘的格式中结合在一起时，他们就会拥有神圣的力量。",
	"Many outsiders assume that the ascendant councilors are the Undying Court, and it's true they are the source of its power. But the Undying Court refers to {@i all} the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the {@i spirit idols}. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor—this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years—but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.": "许多外人认为，长老会成员就是不死阁，他们确实是不死阁的权力来源。但不死阁指的是（%0%）岛上的不死守护者，从士兵到（%1%）。你可能不会期望成为一个长老级的理事--这是一个通常需要数千年的进化过程--但你可以渴望在死后加入不死阁。",
	"As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones—such as the one in Shae Mordai—but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn't rely on faith; there's no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people—from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive.": "作为一个艾瑞尼人，你对自己对不死之庭的责任有着敏锐的认识。不死之身是靠正能量维持的；这可以从伊里安的显化区--比如Shae Mordai的显化区--汲取，但也可以通过爱和奉献产生。与Eberron的许多宗教不同，不死之庭并不依赖信仰；不存在不死之庭是否存在的问题。但它确实依赖于奉献。你的祈祷和你的信仰是你为法庭为你和你的人民所做的一切提供的交换条件--从保护你的土地不受入侵、瘟疫和自然灾害的影响，到指导你的领导人和训练你的年轻人。你们的祖先保护你们，但他们也需要你们的奉献来生存。",
	"The deathless state isn't the only way to experience eternity. Most honored dead of Aerenal are preserved in spirit idols that preserve the soul from the dissolution of Dolurrh. This stone bust of a dead elf holds relics of their corpse (bone shards, a lock of hair) embedded within it. While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance—a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A {@i spirit idol} can be awakened with the {@spell speak with dead} spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.": "无死亡状态并不是体验永恒的唯一途径。艾瑞纳的大多数尊贵的死者都被保存在精神偶像中，使灵魂免受多鲁尔的溶解。这个死去的精灵的半身石像内嵌有他们尸体的遗物（骨头碎片、一绺头发）。在休眠状态下，神像内的灵魂不知道外界或时间的流逝，存在于一种持续的恍惚中--一种由记忆和个人经历建立的梦境般的存在。一个{@i spirit idol}的神像可以通过{@spell speak with dead}的咒语被唤醒，尽管有些神像会无限期地保持意识，并且可以被发现担任导师、教务长和法官。",
	"Not all Aereni want to become deathless—many consider the {@i spirit idol} the superior state. The deathless are sworn to protect and serve the living, and must deal with the ongoing inconvenience of physical existence; within a {@i spirit idol}, an elf can experience eternal peace in a dream of their own making. For many Aereni, their greatest goal in life is to gather the memories and ideas that will be their companions in their eternal trance after death.": "并非所有艾瑞尼人都想成为无死之人--许多人认为{@i spirit idol}的状态更优越。没有死亡的人发誓要保护和服务于活着的人，并且必须处理身体存在的持续不便；在{@i spirit idol}的范围内，精灵可以在他们自己制造的梦境中体验永恒的和平。对许多Aereni来说，他们一生中最大的目标是收集记忆和想法，这些记忆和想法将成为他们死后永恒的恍惚中的伙伴。",
	"While there are more {@i spirit idols} than there are deathless, not all dead are preserved this way. {@i Spirit idols} are reserved for those who have proven worthy of eternal existence. The common dead are embalmed after death and interred in the vast catacombs below the land, along with a record of their life. Only those who have committed truly heinous crimes—such as grave robbers—are denied memory; such criminals are burned after death, their ashes scattered in the oceans, with no records kept of their lives.": "虽然{@i spirit idols}比没有死亡的人多，但并不是所有的死者都是这样被保存的。{@i Spirit idols}是留给那些已经证明值得永恒存在的人。普通死者死后被防腐处理，连同他们的生活记录一起被埋在土地下面的巨大地下墓穴中。只有那些犯下真正令人发指的罪行的人--如盗墓者--才会被剥夺记忆；这样的罪犯在死后被烧死，他们的骨灰散落在海洋中，没有关于他们生活的记录。",
	"Both arcane and divine magic are woven into Aereni civilization more deeply than in the Five Nations. Every citizen of Aerenal knows at least one useful cantrip; the skills of a master magewright in Khorvaire would be considered a mere apprentice's training in Aerenal. Here, spell effects of up to 5th level can be found woven into the fabric of everyday life. {@spell teleportation circle||Teleportation circles} link Aerenal's great cities, and {@i {@spell sending} stations} allow instant communication across any distance. Buildings are raised using the principles of {@spell stone shape}. Diviners communicate with other planes, and healers can break curses and reverse petrification. Spell effects of up to 7th level can be encountered in the hands of master wizards and high priests, and Aereni artificers can craft very rare magic items. As you explore Khorvaire and the lands beyond, bear in mind that in your Aereni eyes, it's little more than a primitive backwater.": "与五国相比，奥术和神术在Aereni文明中的交织程度更深。每个艾瑞纳的公民都至少知道一种有用的咒语；在霍尔韦尔，魔法大师的技能在艾瑞纳仅仅被认为是学徒的训练。在这里，5级以下的法术效果可以在日常生活的结构中找到交织。{@spell teleportation circle||Teleportation circles}连接着Aerenal的大城市，{@i {@spell sending}站}可以跨越任何距离进行即时通信。建筑物是利用（%2%）的原理升起的。占卜者可以与其他位面沟通，治疗者可以打破诅咒并扭转石化现象。大师级的巫师和大祭司手中可以遇到高达7级的法术效果，Aereni工匠可以制作非常罕见的魔法物品。当你探索霍尔韦尔和其他土地时，请记住，在你的Aereni眼中，它只不过是一个原始的落后地区。",
	"At a glance, the people of Aerenal are simply better at everything than their counterparts in Khorvaire, due to their exceptional work ethic and long lifespan. An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren't trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan's goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters—and in Aerenal, they're still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it's a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You've never been encouraged to innovate; you've been taught that {@i the old ways are the best ways}. Do you agree with this?": "一眼望去，艾瑞纳人在任何方面都比霍尔韦尔的同行要强，这是因为他们有特殊的职业道德和长寿命。一个Aereni工匠可以用多个人类的寿命来完善他们的工艺。即使是在恍惚的时候，一个精灵也可能在思考他们的工作。然而，在工业和创新方面，Aerenal落后于Khorvaire。艾瑞尼人并不试图找到更好的方法来做事情；精灵工匠的目标是与过去的大师的技能相匹配，而不是找到新的技术。挑战过去是对那些古老大师的侮辱--在Aerenal，他们仍然存在，仍然在传授他们的技术。一个Aereni工匠可以制造出非常罕见的魔法物品，这是Cannith锻造厂无法比拟的，但这是一件需要多年才能完成的手工艺术品，而Cannith锻造厂正在生产大量的普通和不普通的物品，并不断寻找创新的方法。今天的五国可能无法与Aerenal相提并论，但在过去的一千年中，五国已经发生了巨大的变化，而Aerenal却停滞不前。你从来没有被鼓励去创新，你一直被教导说（%0%）。你同意这一点吗？",
	"Aerenal is effectively a collection of city-states, united in devotion to the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court. Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, \"the line of Mendyrian\" refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname—such as Belaereth Mendyrian—is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it's not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings—the rulers of the united kingdom—are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren't blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.": "Aerenal实际上是一个城邦的集合体，在对兄弟姐妹国王和不朽的法庭的奉献中团结起来。这个国家的每个地区（除了泰尔纳达尔的北部领土）都由一个贵族家族管理。艾伦纳尔的原始定居者来自不同的文化和环境，各系代表了这一点；虽然所有的人都被艾伦纳尔的共同习俗所团结，但每个系都有自己独特的时尚和传统。一个家族是一个古老家族的联盟，由一个带有该家族名称的贵族家族管理。因此，\"门迪里安家族 \"指的是多个家族，但使用该姓氏的人--如贝拉里思-门迪里安--是贵族家族的成员。贵族血统代表了该地区的精英；它不是一个世袭家族，而是一个任人唯贤的组织，其成员从该地区的人民中选出。同样，兄弟姐妹国王--联合王国的统治者--也是同一家族的成员，象征性地是兄弟姐妹，但他们不是血亲。因此，在生活中，精灵们渴望被任命为他们的贵族系列；在死亡时，他们希望被提升到不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating an Aereni elf, work with your DM to develop details about your family and the line you owe allegiance to. Since each line is an alliance of multiple families, there's room for you to add your own details even within an existing line.

	"The line of Jhaelian governs the region around Taer Kalindal. Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the Undying Court and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many monks, clerics, and paladins, as well as many members of the Deathguard—the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down Mabaran undead. Members of this line have a tradition of using cosmetic transmutation to adopt a desiccated appearance—not unlike that of the deathless themselves—though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.": "Jhaelian家族管辖着Taer Kalindal周围的地区。Jhaelian有强大的精神传统；它的成员深深地致力于不朽的法庭和对神圣奥秘的沉思。这个系列产生了许多僧侣、牧师和圣骑士，以及许多死亡守卫的成员--致力于猎杀马巴兰亡灵的Aereni机构。这个系列的成员有一个传统，就是使用化妆术来采用干燥的外观--与无死亡者本身的外观并不一样--尽管其他Jhaelian Aereni喜欢戴面具。",
	"Governors of the region surrounding Pylas Talaear, the line of Melideth produces the finest sailors of Aerenal and maintains the Aereni navy.

	"The line of Mendyrian governs the region around Shae Cairdal, and for most of Aerenal's history they have also been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings. The Mendyrian Aereni are devoted to arcane lore, and many of the most gifted wizards and artificers are Mendyrian. The Mendyrian Aereni take particular pride in their appearance, favoring ornate patterns and decoration in clothing, elaborate hairstyles, and masks of metal or leather.": "门迪里安一系统治着沙伊-凯尔达尔周围的地区，在艾瑞纳的大部分历史中，他们也是兄弟姐妹国王的来源和所在地。门迪里安-艾瑞尼人专注于神秘的传说，许多最有天赋的巫师和工匠都是门迪里安人。门迪雅人对自己的外表感到特别自豪，他们喜欢华丽的图案和装饰的衣服，精致的发型，以及金属或皮革的面具。",
	"Centered around Pylas Zirinth, the line of Tolaen drives Aerenal's lumber industry, both harvesting wood for trade and producing the finest architects and wood-masons on the island. While they are devoted to the Undying Court, the Tolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts than in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen also produce many of Aerenal's soldiers and usually have good relations with the Tairnadal. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple, functional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are usually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen soldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.": "以Pylas Zirinth为中心，Tolaen家族推动了Aerenal的木材工业，既为贸易收获木材，又培养了岛上最好的建筑师和木匠。虽然他们致力于不朽之庭，但托拉恩-艾瑞尼更多的是致力于完善物理工艺，而不是沉思形而上的奥秘。托拉恩也生产许多艾瑞纳的士兵，并且通常与泰尔纳达尔的关系良好。托拉恩-艾瑞尼人喜欢简单、实用的衣服，没有什么装饰品。托拉恩的面具通常由木头制成，可能会有复杂的雕刻；托拉恩士兵经常戴着半面具，遮住他们的下脸。",
	"All but unknown in the Five Nations, the Valraea are a line of {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}. Their ancestors were magebred and charged to guard and govern the coastline of Aerenal. While rare, Valraea can be encountered in any of the port cities of Aerenal and are represented in the Undying Court. While Valraea characters use the sea elf subrace instead of the Aereni elf subrace presented in chapter 6, they are culturally Aereni and all the other material in this section applies to them. Valraea typically dress in leather and are comfortable with casual nudity; they fashion masks from shell and bone. More information about the Valraea Aereni can be found in chapter 4.": "瓦拉亚人在五国中几乎无人知晓，他们是{@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}的一族。他们的祖先是魔法师，负责保卫和管理Aerenal的海岸线。虽然很稀少，但在Aerenal的任何一个港口城市都可以遇到Valraea，并且在不朽的法庭中也有代表。虽然瓦拉亚人使用海精灵亚种，而不是第6章中介绍的艾瑞尼精灵亚种，但他们在文化上属于艾瑞尼人，本节中的所有其他材料都适用于他们。瓦拉亚人通常穿着皮衣，对随意的裸露感到舒服；他们用贝壳和骨头制作面具。更多关于瓦拉亚人的信息可以在第四章中找到。",

It may not be provable, but you believe it's a concrete environmental threat—have you noticed plants tend to die in places with lots of undead? As someone who's going to live a long time, your people take these things seriously. While you can put up with their presence if a situation absolutely requires it, you likely consider negative undead a serious threat.": "作为Aereni，你习惯于与死人一起生活，但那些没有死亡的人是用正能量维持的。与此相反，不死阁教导说，马巴兰亡灵--负能量的亡灵，从骷髅和僵尸到地衣和吸血鬼，都具有内在的破坏性。除了他们中的许多人为了生存而捕食活人之外，他们是马巴的通道，仅仅因为存在而耗尽了世界的环境生命。这可能无法证明，但你相信这是一个具体的环境威胁--你是否注意到在有大量亡灵的地方，植物往往会死亡？作为一个要活很久的人，你的人对这些事情很重视。虽然如果情况绝对需要，你可以忍受他们的存在，但你很可能认为负面的亡灵是一个严重的威胁。",
	"As an Aereni elf in Khorvaire, you're far from home. Are you an exile, an emissary, or a simple tourist? Here are some ways your background might affect your character's new life.": "作为霍尔韦尔的艾瑞尼精灵，你离家很远。你是一个流亡者，一个使者，还是一个普通的游客？这里有一些你的背景可能会影响你的角色的新生活的方式。",
	"As an acolyte, you're a recognized servant of the Undying Court. Temples of the Undying Court are rare in Khorvaire, but they can be found in major cities. Beyond this, you can request minor assistance from any Aereni; they won't place themselves in danger, but they'll show respect and support you.": "作为一名圣徒，你是不死阁公认的仆人。不死阁的寺庙在霍尔韦尔很少见，但在主要城市可以找到。除此之外，你可以向任何艾瑞尼人请求小的援助；他们不会将自己置于危险之中，但他们会对你表示尊重和支持。",
	"Crime is rare in Aerenal, but these backgrounds can reflect a connection to criminal organizations in Khorvaire. This could be something your family developed for business. It could be tied to your personal history, especially if you're an exile from Aerenal. Or you could be an agent of the Cairdal Blades—one of their spies—in which case you might be using criminal connections as a source of information.": "在阿伦纳尔，犯罪是罕见的，但这些背景可以反映出与霍尔韦尔的犯罪组织有联系。这可能是你的家族为了生意而发展的。它可能与你的个人历史有关，特别是如果你是一个来自Aerenal的流亡者。或者你可能是凯尔达尔之刃的特工--他们的间谍--在这种情况下，你可能利用犯罪关系作为信息来源。",
	"As an entertainer, your Popular Demand feature could reflect your reputation in Aerenal, Khorvaire, or both. Are your performances tied to the traditions of your ancestors or are you creating something new? Are you willing to work with House Phiarlan or House Thuranni—who will want to license any popular act—or do you despise the dragonmarked for abandoning Aerenal, refusing to work with them?": "作为一个艺人，你的 \"流行需求 \"功能可以反映你在艾瑞纳、霍尔韦尔或两者的声誉。你的表演是与你的祖先的传统联系在一起，还是你在创造新的东西？你是否愿意与皮亚伦家族或瑟兰尼家族合作--他们会想要许可任何受欢迎的行为--或者你鄙视龙纹家族放弃阿伦纳尔，拒绝与他们合作？",
	"Being considered a folk hero in Aerenal won't do you much good if you're adventuring in Khorvaire. The question is what you've done {@i since} arriving in Khorvaire to earn this reputation... and just as important, why. What is it that would drive you to fight for the common people of a distant land? Is it tied to the reason you left Aerenal? Are you just an altruist, or have you carefully constructed your identity as a folk hero as part of some grand design that could take a century to bear fruit?": "如果你在Khorvaire冒险，在Aerenal被认为是一个民间英雄对你没有什么好处。问题是你到了霍尔韦尔后做了什么（%0%）来赢得这个声誉......同样重要的是，为什么。是什么促使你为一个遥远的地方的普通人而战？它与你离开阿伦纳的原因有关吗？你只是一个利他主义者，还是你精心构建了你作为民间英雄的身份，作为一些可能需要一个世纪才能开花结果的宏伟设计的一部分？",
	"Both of these are sound paths for Aereni. An Aereni scholar could make an excellent sage. As a hermit, you may have had a vision from the Undying Court or a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy that has led you to distant lands.": "这两点对Aereni来说都是合理的途径。一个Aereni学者可以成为一个优秀的圣人。作为一个隐士，你可能有来自不死宫廷的异象，或者瞥见了龙人的预言，从而将你带到了遥远的地方。",
	"As a member of a noble line, you weren't born to your position, you were raised into it. What did you do to earn this honor? You're seen as one of the most promising members of your line, but you're also expected to serve the interests of your line and your people; do you embrace this duty? While you may not be a noble of the Five Nations, most of the nations of Khorvaire show great respect to Aereni nobles, and your Position of Privilege should still open doors in high society": "作为一个贵族家族的成员，你不是生来就有这个地位的，你是被养成的。你做了什么来赢得这个荣誉？你被视为你的家族中最有前途的成员之一，但你也被期望为你的家族和你的人民的利益服务；你是否接受这一职责？虽然你可能不是五国的贵族，但霍尔韦尔的大多数国家都对艾瑞尼贵族表现出极大的尊重，你的特权地位仍然可以在上流社会打开大门。",
	"The line of Melideth are the sailors of the Aereni. While Aerenal has little interest in exploration and remained neutral in the Last War, Melideth traders can be found across the seas.": "梅利达斯一系是艾瑞尼的水手。虽然艾瑞尼对探索没有什么兴趣，并在最后一次战争中保持中立，但在大洋彼岸可以找到梅利达斯商人。",
	"You may have served in the armed forces of your line, or you might be a member of the Deathguard, the elite military force tasked to eliminate negative undead (a logical background for a cleric or paladin). Your rank will likely be recognized by any loyal citizen of Aerenal. While you have no authority in the Five Nations, officers may at least respect you as a fellow soldier. On the other hand, as an elf, you've had a long life; it could be that you left Aerenal a decade or two ago and served with one of the Five Nations. If so, what drew you into the war? How does your family feel about your actions?": "你可能曾在你的家族的武装力量中服役，或者你可能是死亡守卫的成员，这是一支负责消除负面不死生物的精英军队（对于牧师或圣骑士来说是一个合理的背景）。你的等级可能会被任何忠诚的艾瑞纳公民所认可。虽然你在五国中没有权力，但官员们至少会把你当作同胞士兵来尊重。另一方面，作为一个精灵，你已经有了很长的生命；可能你在一二十年前就离开了Aerenal，在五国之一服役。如果是这样，是什么吸引你加入战争的？你的家人对你的行为有什么看法？",
	"The {@background far traveler|scag} and {@background inheritor|scag} backgrounds from the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag} are sound choices for an Aereni elf. The {@background haunted one|cos} background from {@adventure Curse of Strahd|cos} could reflect something you saw in the Mabaran manifest zones of your homeland—or you could be literally haunted by an ancestor.": "来自{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}的{@background far traveler|scag}和{@background inheritor|scag}的背景是一个Aereni精灵的合理选择。来自{@adventure Curse of Strahd|cos}的{@background haunted one|cos}背景可以反映出你在家乡的马巴兰宣言区看到的东西，或者你可能真的被一个祖先缠住了。",
	"The Aereni are the dominant culture of Aerenal. The Tairnadal are a separate culture that came to Aerenal during the exodus and laid claim to the northern steppes. Rather than preserving their ancestors as deathless or {@i spirit idols}, the Tairnadal believe they anchor their ancestors by emulating their heroic deeds.": "艾瑞尼人是艾瑞纳尔的主流文化。泰尔纳达尔人是一种独立的文化，他们在逃亡期间来到艾瑞纳尔，并对北部草原提出了要求。泰尔纳达尔人认为，他们不是把自己的祖先当作不死之身或（%0%）来保存，而是通过模仿他们的英雄事迹来固定祖先。",
	"The Tairnadal have a long alliance with the Aereni and fight alongside their cousins when the island is threatened. It's possible for elves to immigrate from one culture to another; the line of Tolaen is known for having close ties to the Tairnadal. But they're separate cultures; the Tairnadal don't worship the Undying Court and its warriors don't become deathless.": "泰尔纳达尔人与艾瑞尼人长期结盟，当岛屿受到威胁时与他们的表亲并肩作战。精灵有可能从一种文化移民到另一种文化；托拉恩一系因与泰尔纳达尔有密切联系而闻名。但它们是独立的文化；泰尔纳达尔人不崇拜不朽之庭，它的战士也不会变成不死之身。",
	"You were born with a bond to an otherworldly being. You have memories of a life you've never lived, visions of battling fiends and an endless struggle against darkness. When you sleep, you don't dream as others do, but you often wake with a sense of purpose or new ideas. You see the pain and suffering in the world and know that there is a path to light—but there are monsters in the shadows, faceless enemies that have been hunting you since before you were born.": "你出生时就与一个异世界的存在有联系。你有关于你从未经历过的生活的记忆，有与恶魔战斗的幻觉，有与黑暗的无尽斗争。当你睡觉时，你不像其他人那样做梦，但你经常带着目的感或新想法醒来。你看到世界上的痛苦和磨难，知道有一条通往光明的道路--但阴影中还有怪物，那些不露面的敌人从你出生前就一直在追捕你。",
	"Will you embrace the spirit within you and make its struggle your own? Will you stand against the darkness, even if it draws the many eyes of the Dreaming Dark upon you? Or will you ignore that inner voice and try to live your own life?": "你是否会拥抱你内心的精神，并把它的斗争作为你自己的斗争？你是否会站在黑暗的对立面，即使它吸引了许多梦想中的黑暗的眼睛来关注你？或者，你会无视那内心的声音，试图过你自己的生活吗？",
	"The quori are spirits of nightmare. But just as angels can fall, fiends can rise. Centuries ago, a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that dominates Dal Quor. The Dreaming Dark hunted them across the dreamscape, seeking to consume and reclaim them. In desperation, these rebel spirits reached out to Eberron, finding a haven in the minds and bodies of a group of Adaran monks. Sixty-seven spirits escaped, and the first kalashtar were born.": "科里是噩梦的灵魂。但就像天使会堕落一样，恶魔也会崛起。几个世纪前，一小撮科里人背叛了主宰达尔-库尔的邪恶力量il-Lashtavar。梦中的黑暗在整个梦境中追捕他们，试图吞噬并夺回他们。在绝望中，这些反叛的灵魂向艾伯伦伸出了援手，在一群阿达兰僧侣的思想和身体中找到了庇护所。六十七个灵魂逃了出来，第一批卡拉斯塔诞生了。",
	"As a kalashtar, you're descended from one of these monks. A quori is bound to your bloodline. It exists in the minds and dreams of all of your siblings, and as long as one of you is alive the quori is sustained. Should you all die, the spirit will be lost... and so, the Dreaming Dark is always happy to kill a kalashtar.": "作为一个卡拉什塔，你是这些僧侣中的一个的后代。Quori与你的血脉紧密相连。它存在于你所有兄弟姐妹的思想和梦境中，只要你们中的一个人活着，就能维持 \"魁力\"。如果你们都死了，精神就会丧失......因此，做梦的黑暗总是很高兴能杀死一个卡拉什塔。",
	"The kalashtar were born centuries ago, and have since spread out from Adar. What is your background? What has set you on the path to adventure? Are you searching for allies against the Dreaming Dark, or are you pursuing a mission of your own?": "卡拉什塔人诞生于几个世纪前，此后从阿达尔扩散出去。你的背景是什么？是什么让你走上了冒险的道路？你是在寻找对抗梦幻黑暗的盟友，还是在追求你自己的使命？",
	"The kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won't be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light.": "卡拉斯塔人出生在遥远的亚达大陆的萨洛纳。今天，里德拉帝国统治着萨洛纳，帝国军队无休止地围攻阿达尔。阿达尔的僧侣和祭司们相信，与启发者和il-Lashtavar的战争不会靠武器取胜；相反，祈祷和指导冥想将最终把平衡从黑暗转向光明。",
	"Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. If you are from Adar, what caused you to leave your monastery and brave the Riedran blockades? Have the elders entrusted you with a specific mission, or has your quori spirit driven you to distant lands? The hermit background is a good way to reflect a mystic from a distant land possessing dangerous revelations.": "阿达兰卡拉斯塔很少无缘无故地采取直接行动。如果你来自阿达，是什么原因导致你离开你的修道院，勇敢面对里德兰的封锁？是长老们委托你去完成一个特定的任务，还是你的夸里精神驱使你去遥远的地方？隐士背景是反映一个来自远方拥有危险启示的神秘主义者的好方法。",
	"Of all the origins mentioned here, you likely have the strongest connection to your quori spirit. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. You were taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness; can you reconcile this with your adventuring life? If you've recently arrived in Khorvaire after living your life in a monastery, you are unaccustomed to crime and greed. Is the chaos of a city like Sharn disorienting?": "在这里提到的所有起源中，你很可能与你的奎里精神有最强的联系。Adaran kalashtar是禁欲主义者，有纪律，专注于光明之路。你被教导要激励那些生活在恐惧中的人，启迪那些迷失在黑暗中的人；你能把这一点与你的冒险生活相协调吗？如果你在修道院生活后最近才来到霍尔韦尔，你不习惯犯罪和贪婪。像沙恩这样混乱的城市是否让人迷失方向？",
	"There are kalashtar communities in several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. Kalashtar prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. If you were raised in such a community, you're familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there's no Riedran army at the gates; you know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it's a ghost in the shadows.": "在五国的几个主要城市都有卡拉什塔社区，包括沙恩的眺望区和费尔海文的白墙。卡拉什塔人喜欢彼此靠近，既是为了实践他们共同的传统，也是为了共同抵御任何由梦幻黑暗构成的威胁。如果你在这样的社区长大，你就会熟悉光明之路和其他卡拉什塔人的习俗。但门口没有瑞德兰军队；你知道逐梦的黑暗是一种威胁，但它是阴影中的一个幽灵。",
	"Many kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don't believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and to ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher's focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.": "许多卡拉什塔只是想通过他们的日常行为来传播光明，例如表现出仁慈和同情心或调解争端。另一方面，霍尔韦尔的一些卡拉什塔人在与黑暗的斗争中走上了一条残酷的道路。影子守望者不相信邪恶可以仅仅通过仁慈和祈祷来对抗。这个组织的成员寻求确定腐败的来源，并无情地消除它们。虽然暗影监视者的重点是梦幻黑暗的代理人，但他们可以追捕任何邪恶的力量，无论是超自然的还是其他的。",
	"As a kalashtar of Khorvaire, you could bring a compassionate approach to any background; whether you're an acolyte of the Path of Light, a wise sage, or a lively entertainer, you do your best to help the innocent and lift spirits. Criminal and charlatan would be unusual paths, but the spy background could reflect the work of a Shadow Watcher. While you aren't as isolated from the world as an Adaran kalashtar, you're still guided by alien instincts and have an otherworldly demeanor.": "作为霍尔韦尔的卡拉什塔，你可以为任何背景带来一种同情心；无论你是光明之路的信徒、明智的圣人，还是活泼的艺人，你都会尽力帮助无辜的人，提升精神。犯罪分子和江湖术士将是不寻常的道路，但间谍背景可以反映出影子监视者的工作。虽然你不像阿达兰-卡拉什塔人那样与世隔绝，但你仍然被外星的本能所引导，并有一种异世界的气质。",
	"Kalashtar can breed with humans and half-elves, and their children have an equal chance of being fully kalashtar or the race of the other parent. Kalashtar are quite rare; even in cities like Sharn with kalashtar communities, there are many people who will assume kalashtar are just humans with strange eyes... or some sort of half-elf, maybe? Maybe it's a new fashion?": "卡拉什塔人可以与人类和半精灵交配，他们的孩子有同样的机会成为完全的卡拉什塔人或另一个父母的种族。卡拉什塔人相当罕见；即使在像沙恩这样有卡拉什塔人社区的城市，也有很多人会认为卡拉什塔人只是有奇怪眼睛的人类......或者某种半精灵，也许？也许这是一种新的时尚？",
	"As such, there are kalashtar in Khorvaire who grew up without the guidance of a kalashtar parent. Orphans may be entirely unaware of their heritage and the nature of their quori spirit—it tries to communicate through dream-visions and instincts, but lacking any context, such orphans rarely understand their quori bond. Nonetheless, the quori is an integral part of them, urging them toward the light—and indeed, most orphans follow such a path. A kalashtar orphan who chooses a darker path is fighting the instincts imparted by their spirit. Such a kalashtar is likely to be deeply conflicted, which can manifest as unidentified stress, fits of rage, depression, or unpredictable behavior.": "因此，在Khorvaire有一些卡拉什塔人，他们在没有卡拉什塔人父母的指导下成长起来。孤儿们可能完全不知道他们的遗产和他们的quori精神的性质--它试图通过梦境和本能来沟通，但由于缺乏任何背景，这些孤儿很少理解他们的quori纽带。尽管如此，\"魁力 \"是他们不可分割的一部分，敦促他们走向光明--事实上，大多数孤儿都走上了这样一条道路。一个选择黑暗道路的卡拉什塔孤儿是在与他们的精神所赋予的本能作斗争。这样的卡拉什塔人可能会有很深的冲突，这可以表现为不明的压力、愤怒、抑郁或不可预测的行为。",
	"An orphan kalashtar can follow any path. Whether altruistic, nefarious, or somewhere in between, work with your DM to decide how you interpret the influence of your quori bond. Have you followed its guidance despite not knowing its true nature? Do you interpret it as a curse or ghost, twisting your thoughts and putting you at odds with yourself? Have you found the inner determination to suppress it entirely? Do you ultimately want to come to terms with your kalashtar nature, or do you like being an outsider and prefer to stay that way?": "一个孤儿卡拉什塔可以走任何道路。无论是利他主义的、邪恶的，还是介于两者之间的，请与你的DM合作，决定你如何解释你的Qori纽带的影响。尽管你不知道它的真实性质，但你是否遵循它的指导？你是否把它解释为一种诅咒或幽灵，扭曲你的思想，使你与自己产生矛盾？你是否找到了完全压制它的内在决心？你最终是想接受你的卡拉什塔本性，还是喜欢做一个局外人，并宁愿保持这种状态？",
	"As a kalashtar, you're part of a spiritual lineage, traditionally reflected by the suffix of your name. For example, Lanhareth and Minhareth are both kalashtar of the lineage of Hareth. Your lineage is set before birth, tied to one of your parents. If you are born to kalashtar of Vaktri and Hareth, you inherit only one of the bonds, often that of the parent of your gender. Since you can't inherit both bonds, you won't be half Hareth and half Vaktri. Your lineage affects your appearance and personality, eye color, hair color, and other aspects. When you meet another kalashtar of your lineage, you'll see common traits, but you'll also feel a deeper connection; in some ways, you're one person.": "作为卡拉什塔，你是精神世系的一部分，传统上由你名字的后缀反映。例如，Lanhareth和Minhareth都是Hareth血统的卡拉什塔人。你的血统在出生前就已确定，与你的父母之一联系在一起。如果你是由瓦克特里和哈雷斯的卡拉什塔所生，你只能继承其中一个纽带，通常是你性别的父母的纽带。由于你不能同时继承两种纽带，所以你不会是一半哈雷斯和一半瓦克特里。你的血统会影响你的外表和性格、眼睛颜色、头发颜色和其他方面。当你遇到另一个与你同一血统的卡拉什塔，你会看到共同的特征，但你也会感到更深的联系；在某些方面，你们是一个人。",
	"The quori bond exists on a deep level. Your quori doesn't hover over your shoulder or whisper in your ear. Instead, it exists in the collective subconscious of all kalashtar of your lineage, shaping and guiding you all. You feel it as instinct, in memories of things you've never done—visions of a war in the realm of dreams. When you sleep, you don't dream, but the bond grows stronger. Your quori may even give visions to guide you. With time and training, you can strengthen this connection, learning to hear its psychic voice more clearly; the Quori Bond feat presented in chapter 6 is one way to reflect this stronger bond. Ultimately, it's up to you how you roleplay your connection. While the quori isn't an active presence that responds in conversation, some kalashtar do speak to it as if it was, talking with the quori as a way of processing their own thoughts. Others take comfort in its subconscious presence, confident it is with them at all times. And some—notably orphans—refuse to acknowledge it, determined to see their mind as their own.": "魁北克的关系存在于一个很深的层次。你的quori不会在你的肩膀上盘旋或在你耳边低语。相反，它存在于你的血统中所有卡拉什塔人的集体潜意识中，塑造并指导着你们所有人。你觉得它是一种本能，在你从未做过的事情的记忆中--在梦境中的战争预想。当你睡觉时，你不会做梦，但这种联系却越来越强。你的奎里甚至会发出幻觉来引导你。随着时间的推移和训练，你可以加强这种联系，学会更清楚地听到它的心灵之声；第6章中介绍的Quori Bond壮举是反映这种更强联系的一种方式。归根结底，这取决于你如何扮演你的联系。虽然Quori并不是一个能在对话中做出反应的主动存在，但一些卡拉什塔人确实像它一样与它对话，把与Quori对话作为处理他们自己想法的一种方式。其他人则对它的潜意识存在感到安慰，相信它一直与他们在一起。而有些人--特别是孤儿--拒绝承认它，决心把自己的思想看作是自己的。",
	"In creating a kalashtar character, it's important to consider what type of quori you're bound to. You can develop this through roleplaying, but it can also be reflected by your choice of class and by your abilities or spells. Each quori has a connection to a particular emotion. Fiendish quori feed on this emotion, using it to manipulate mortals. In your case, it could be that you understand how to generate that emotion in others, or that you yourself experience that emotion in a deep and powerful way. Or it could be that you have learned how to suppress that emotion, and that is the source of your strength. Whatever choice you make, it will be reflected throughout your lineage. If you decide that Vaktri is a du'ulora quori and that you draw on his burning fury to produce your own barbarian rage, then other Vaktri kalashtar you meet may also be barbarians or furious warriors.": "在创建一个卡拉什塔角色时，重要的是要考虑你与哪种类型的奎里有缘。你可以通过角色扮演来发展这一点，但它也可以通过你选择的等级和你的能力或法术来反映。每一个quori都与一种特定的情感有联系。邪恶的奎里以这种情感为食，利用它来操纵凡人。就你而言，你可能了解如何在他人身上产生这种情感，或者你自己以一种深刻而强大的方式体验到这种情感。也可能是你已经学会了如何压制这种情绪，而这就是你力量的来源。无论你做出什么选择，它都会反映在你的整个血统中。如果你决定瓦克特里是一个du'ulora quori，并且你从他燃烧的愤怒中汲取营养，产生你自己的野蛮人的愤怒，那么你遇到的其他瓦克特里卡拉什塔也可能是野蛮人或愤怒的战士。",
	"The three quori presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} are described below, along with another fourth common quori, the du'ulora, whose statistics are presented in chapter 8.

	"The fiendish du'ulora are spirits of rage and aggression. In Dal Quor, they craft dreams that drive feuds and vendettas, spurring mortals to violence and vengeance. Your du'ulora spirit has turned against the darkness, but fury remains its domain and anger is your birthright. How do you express this? As a bard, you might specialize in taunting enemies, turning their anger against them and driving them to rash action. As a barbarian, you could say that your spirit is the source of your rage. As a paladin, you might channel its fury when you smite your foes. You might be calm and serene most of the time, expressing sudden powerful moments of rage when you draw on your bond.": "邪恶的杜罗拉是愤怒和侵略的灵魂。在达尔-库尔，他们制作的梦境推动着仇怨和报复，刺激着凡人的暴力和复仇。你的du'ulora精神已经转向反对黑暗，但愤怒仍然是它的领域，愤怒是你的天赋权利。你如何表达这个？作为一个吟游诗人，你可能擅长嘲弄敌人，将他们的愤怒转向他们，促使他们采取轻率的行动。作为一个野蛮人，你可以说你的精神是你愤怒的源泉。作为一个圣骑士，你可能会在打击敌人时引导它的怒火。你可能在大多数时候都是平静安详的，当你利用你的纽带时，会突然表达出强大的愤怒。",
	"The key thing to remember is that your du'ulora has chosen the path of light, even if it is a spirit of rage. You may revel in moments when you get to unleash your anger on your enemies, but it still drives you to fight for a noble cause. Your fury is a tool, and you should never let it drag you into darkness.": "要记住的关键是，你的du'ulora已经选择了光明的道路，即使是愤怒的精神。你可能会陶醉在对敌人释放愤怒的时刻，但它仍然促使你为崇高的事业而战。你的愤怒是一种工具，你不应该让它把你拖入黑暗。",
	"The hashalaq are seducers and deceivers, feeding on doubt and desire. They are the spies and loremasters of the quori. Hashalaq kalashtar make excellent bards; the College of Lore reflects both your love of knowledge and your ability to confuse your foes. Hashalaq make excellent warlocks, with your spirit granting the {@optfeature Beguiling Influence} invocation and allowing you to charm your enemies. As a hashalaq kalashtar, consider whether you specialize in deception, or choose to be honest and focus on your ability to inspire positive emotion—do you prefer cunning {@skill Deception} or empathic {@skill Persuasion}? Hashalaq clerics typically follow this latter path, using their knowledge to guide allies and cut through the deception that comes so naturally to their kind.": "哈撒拉克是诱惑者和欺骗者，以怀疑和欲望为食。他们是科里人的间谍和传说家。哈沙拉克-卡拉什塔是优秀的吟游诗人；传说学院反映了你对知识的热爱和你迷惑敌人的能力。哈沙拉克人是优秀的术士，你的精神赋予了{@optfeature Beguiling Influence}召唤术，并允许你迷惑你的敌人。作为一个哈沙拉克的卡拉什塔，请考虑你是专攻欺骗，还是选择诚实，专注于你激发积极情感的能力--你是喜欢狡猾的（%1%）还是同情的（%2%）？哈沙拉克教士通常走后一条路，用他们的知识来引导盟友，并穿过对他们来说很自然的欺骗。",
	"The kalaraq are spirits of pride and ambition. The natural leaders of the quori, they dominate through sheer charisma and force of will. As a kalaraq kalashtar, you surely have your own grand ambitions. You excel at inspiring others to follow you and you won't hesitate to take bold action. You might lead in the vanguard as a paladin, or strengthen your allies as a cleric, or bend enemies to your will as a bard of the {@class bard||College of Glamour|glamour|XGE}.

	"The kalaraq are the rarest and most powerful of the quori. The kalaraq Taratai was the leader of the rebels, and hers is the only spiritual lineage that has been completely destroyed by Dreaming Dark; Taratai's own fate is unknown.

	"The tsucora feed on terror and craft the most classic nightmares. As a tsucora kalashtar, you have a deep understanding of fear.

	"Kalashtar are known for their psychic gifts, but aside from their Mind Link, how does this manifest in a kalashtar character? In fifth edition, how do they wield mental power? Chapter 6 presents a Mind Domain cleric and two kalashtar racial feats. In addition, characters carry an innate sense of mental discipline—a kalashtar monk could consider ki as a representation of psionic ability, and the Living Weapon monastic tradition in chapter 6 builds on this. But you can also change the flavor of a class without altering the mechanics. Consider the following ideas.": "Kalashtar以他们的精神天赋而闻名，但除了他们的心灵链接外，这在Kalashtar角色中是如何体现的？在第五版中，他们是如何挥舞精神力量的？第6章介绍了一个心灵领域的牧师和两个卡拉什塔人的种族特技。此外，角色还带有一种与生俱来的精神纪律感--卡拉什塔僧侣可以将ki视为幻术能力的代表，而第六章中的活体武器僧侣传统则是建立在这个基础之上的。但你也可以在不改变机制的情况下改变一个类别的味道。请考虑以下想法。",
	"Many kalashtar seek to fight evil through inspiration, and the bard can be an excellent foundation for this. While Bardic Inspiration is described as \"stirring words or music,\" you can describe your actions as being tied to psychic gifts; instead of a mystical song, you could describe your inspiration as a word backed by a surge of psychic energy. When you use the Words of Terror of the {@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE} or the Cutting Words of the {@class bard||College of Lore|lore}, this could easily reflect your powers of psychic manipulation. Likewise, your spellcasting is mechanically magic; it can be counterspelled, it won't work in an {@spell antimagic field}, and so on. But you can easily describe {@spell vicious mockery} or {@spell crown of madness} as psychic attacks, or present {@spell cure wounds} as a psychometabolic effect, using your mind to knit together the wounds of another. You gain no mechanical advantage from this—in the case of Bardic Inspiration, your target still has to be able to hear you, even if you're using psychic power—but there's nothing preventing you from presenting your bard as being psychically gifted as opposed to singing magic songs.": "许多卡拉什塔人寻求通过灵感来对抗邪恶，而吟游诗人可以成为这方面的一个很好的基础。虽然吟游诗人的灵感被描述为 \"激动人心的话语或音乐\"，但你可以把你的行动描述为与灵性的天赋联系在一起；而不是一首神秘的歌曲，你可以把你的灵感描述为由涌动的灵性能量支持的一个词。当你使用{@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}的恐怖之语或{@class bard||College of Lore|lore}的切割之语时，这很容易反映出你的精神操纵能力。同样地，你的咒语是机械性的魔法；它可以被反咒，在（%2%）的情况下不会起作用，等等。但你可以很容易地将（3%）或（4%）描述为精神攻击，或将（5%）呈现为精神代谢效果，用你的思想将他人的伤口编织起来。你没有从中获得任何机械优势--就吟游诗人的灵感而言，你的目标仍然必须能够听到你的声音，即使你使用的是精神力量--但没有什么能阻止你把吟游诗人说成是有精神天赋的，而不是唱魔法歌曲。",
	"Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic. Priests of the Path of Light say that the faithful are inspired by il-Yannah—the great light that will one day rise to replace the Dreaming Dark—but their power comes from within. As such, both cleric and paladin are logical paths for a kalashtar, and you can add psychic flavor to your spells as described with the bard above. When you cast {@spell command}, you aren't demanding your victim bow to il-Yannah; instead, il-Yannah is strengthening your mind and allowing you to impose your will on the target. Effects such as {@spell bless} could reflect your ongoing psychic guidance, while {@spell cure wounds} and similar spells could be psychometabolic. Your faith helps you focus your mind, but it's your mind that generates the power. If you want to take this farther, the {@class cleric||Mind domain|mind|ExploringEberron} presented in chapter 6 allows you to replace radiant damage with psychic damage; thus, you can flavor your {@spell sacred flame} as a psionic blast instead of holy fire.": "大多数卡拉什塔人都献身于光明之路，虽然它的信徒不崇拜任何神灵，但信仰本身可以成为神圣魔法的来源。光明之路的牧师们说，信徒们受到了伊尔-雅娜的启发--有朝一日会崛起取代梦幻黑暗的伟大之光--但他们的力量来自于内心。因此，牧师和圣骑士都是卡拉斯塔的合理途径，你可以像上面吟游诗人所描述的那样为你的法术添加灵性的味道。当你施展（%0%）时，你并没有要求你的受害者向il-Yannah鞠躬；相反，il-Yannah正在加强你的思想，并允许你将你的意志强加给目标。诸如(1%)这样的效果可以反映出你正在进行的精神指导，而(2%)和类似的法术可能是精神代谢。你的信仰帮助你集中精神，但产生力量的是你的思想。如果你想走得更远，第六章中介绍的{@class cleric||Mind domain|mind|ExploringEberron}允许你用精神伤害取代辐射伤害；因此，你可以把你的{@spell sacred flame}当作幻象爆炸而不是圣火。",
	"This same concept can work for a {@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE} sorcerer. You don't use the trappings of a priest, but your visions of il-Yannah have allowed you to focus your mind and alter reality. You can select spells that feel like they could be psychic powers; when you cast mage hand, it can be flavored as an act of telekinesis.": "这个概念同样可以适用于{@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE}巫师。你不使用牧师的外衣，但你对il-Yannah的幻觉使你能够集中精神并改变现实。你可以选择那些感觉像是通灵能力的法术；当你施展法师之手时，它可以被调味成心灵感应的行为。",

As a warlock, you might have an especially strong bond to this spirit and receive clearer visions than most kalashtar of your lineage; traditionally, kalashtar with such a strong connection are called atavists. The {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} is an easy choice, as many of its spells reflect mental manipulation; you can describe {@spell Evard's black tentacles} as ectoplasmic projections, or {@spell armor of Agathys} as a blend of telekinetic force and cryokinesis. The Awakened Mind feature soon becomes obsolete due to Mind Link; a DM could choose to combine the two, increasing the range of a kalashtar warlock's Mind Link feature by 30 feet. The {@class warlock||Celestial|celestial|XGE} patron is another logical choice, focusing on your quori as a spirit of light. As a {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} or any warlock using the {@optfeature Pact of the Blade}, you can describe your weapon as being forged from nightmares.": "你可以简单地将你的术士法术描述为来自精神力量，而不是奥术召唤。你的守护者是你的奎里精神。作为一个术士，你可能与这个精神有特别强烈的联系，并且比你的血统中的大多数卡拉什塔人得到更清晰的视野；传统上，具有这种强烈联系的卡拉什塔人被称为阿塔夫。{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}是一个简单的选择，因为它的许多法术都反映了精神操纵；你可以把{@spell Evard's black tentacles}描述为外质投影，或者{@spell armor of Agathys}描述为心灵感应和低温运动的混合。由于心灵链接的存在，觉醒的心灵功能很快就会被淘汰；DM可以选择将两者结合起来，将卡拉什塔术士的心灵链接功能的范围增加30英尺。{@class warlock||Celestial|celestial|XGE}的守护者是另一个合理的选择，专注于你作为光之精灵的quori。作为{@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}或任何使用{@optfeature Pact of the Blade}的术士，你可以将你的武器描述为由噩梦铸成。",

	"{@b Lurashtai} began her existence as a tsucora quori. She wove dreams of gothic horror, playing on her victims' fears of death and the undead. Raised on these morbid memories, the kalashtar of her line are comfortable with tragedy, have no fear of death, and see beauty in things that others find disturbing or terrifying. As a spirit of light, Lurashtai has taken an interest in the undead; she fears that by being trapped outside the cycle of life and dream, the undead weaken the shared soul of the age. As a result, the kalashtar of her line are often driven to hunt undead and lay their spirits to rest. Lurashtai kalashtar usually have pale complexions, sharp features, and silky, dark hair; they generally favor the color red in their clothing.": "{@b Lurashtai}开始她的存在是作为一个tsucora quori。她编织着哥特式恐怖的梦境，利用受害者对死亡和亡灵的恐惧。在这些病态的记忆中长大，她那一系的卡拉什塔对悲剧感到舒服，对死亡没有恐惧，并在别人认为令人不安或可怕的事物中看到了美。作为一个光之精灵，露拉丝泰对亡灵产生了兴趣；她担心，由于被困在生命和梦想的循环之外，亡灵会削弱这个时代的共同灵魂。因此，她这一系的卡拉什塔人经常被驱使去猎杀亡灵，让他们的灵魂安息。卢拉什泰-卡拉什塔通常有苍白的肤色，尖锐的特征，以及丝质的黑发；他们一般喜欢红色的衣服。",
	"{@b Aveth}, a hashalaq quori, wielded the twin weapons of manipulation and insight before his exodus from Dal Quor. He takes great interest in the potential that mortals hold to choose a nobler path, much as he and his kind fled Darkness in search of Light.

They have great confidence in their ability to win over potential foes, turning them into friends, which can yield unexpected allies—or the untimely death of the too-optimistic kalashtar.

	"As a shifter adventurer, you walk a path between the wilds and the civilized world. You are driven by primal instincts, the whispers of Wolf or Rat. When you embrace those voices, you transform.

Or do you hate shifting, fearing that you might one day lose yourself to the beast within?": "作为一个变身者的冒险者，你走在荒野和文明世界之间的路上。你被原始的本能所驱使，狼或鼠的低语。当你接受这些声音时，你就会转变。你是否将你的转变形态视为真正的自我，陶醉于这些原始的升华时刻？还是你讨厌转变，担心有一天你会被内心的野兽所迷惑？",

The bulk of the shifter population of Khorvaire is based in the Towering Wood, the vast forest that stretches across the northwest. Over the last four decades, shifters have emerged from the deep woods to live in the farmlands of the Eldeen Reaches, shaping the culture of this new nation. Outside the Towering Wood, many shifters fled the violence and persecution of the Silver Crusade, leading to their scattering across the Five Nations. While the hysteria of the Silver Crusade has long since died down, there are still many who treat shifters with fear or suspicion. {@i They're weretouched, more beast than human. They're prone to violence—they can't help it.

If you're from such a tribe, what drove you to leave the woods? Are you following a druidic prophecy? Pursuing an ancient evil that's escaped from the wood? Have you been exiled from your tribe, or are you simply driven by curiosity?

Shifters have full control over their gifts, while lycanthropes struggle with them. The beast within may shape a shifter's personality, but it doesn't overwhelm it. By contrast, lycanthropy attempts to destroy the victim's original personality and can turn the most virtuous hero into a bloodthirsty murderer. Wererats and werewolves are cruel killers... but Grandmother Wolf doesn't encourage savagery, and Grandfather Rat doesn't urge murder.

	"The Silver Crusade began when a dark power surged in the Towering Wood, amplifying the power of lycanthropy. The curse became more virulent. Victims fell prey to its power more quickly, guided by some dark power beyond the common evil of the curse. Within the Towering Woods, tribes of shifters fought their corrupted kin. Beyond it, the farmers of Aundair were tormented by raiding wolves and boars. When the templars responded, the beasts that were slain reverted to their natural forms, revealing that they were shifters. The word quickly spread: all shifters were weretouched, capable of turning into savage beasts. None could be trusted! Meanwhile, among the shifter tribes, scouts warned of atrocities committed by the foreign soldiers. In fact, the demagogues on both sides were wererats working to ensure that these possible allies would instead become bitter enemies... and the trick worked. Frightened templars and paranoid mobs slew many innocent shifters, and to this day the extremist sect known as the Pure Flame claims all shifters are servants of darkness.": "白银十字军开始时，一股黑暗的力量在高耸的森林中涌动，放大了狼人的力量。诅咒变得更加剧烈。受害者更快成为其力量的牺牲品，被某种黑暗的力量所引导，超越了诅咒的普通邪恶。在高耸的森林里，变种人部落与他们被腐蚀的亲属战斗。在它之外，昂代尔的农民们被突袭的狼和野猪折磨着。当圣殿骑士们做出反应时，被杀死的野兽恢复了它们的自然形态，显示出它们是变身者。消息很快传开了：所有的变身者都被感染了，能够变成野蛮的野兽。没有人可以信任! 同时，在变身者部落中，侦察员警告说，外国士兵犯下了暴行。事实上，双方的煽动者都在努力确保这些可能的盟友反而会成为痛苦的敌人......而且这招很有效。惊恐的圣殿骑士和偏执的暴徒杀害了许多无辜的变身者，直到今天，被称为 \"纯净火焰 \"的极端主义教派声称所有变身者都是黑暗的仆人。",
	"The fact of the matter is that {@i lycanthropy is a weapon}; it spreads through violence and turns its victims into killers. Its origins may never be discovered, but the Moonspeaker tale is as logical as any. Lycanthropes and shifters are related in that the first lycanthropes were cursed shifters. The unknown force responsible was likely also behind the surge that caused the Silver Crusade—and it could rise again. One logical contender is the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. It's said that Dyrrn created doppelgangers by twisting changelings; it could have used this same technique to create lycanthropes from shifters. Or it could have been the work of an overlord, an archfiend of the Age of Demons; some texts speak of the Wild Heart, an overlord who destroys civilizations and feeds on primal cruelty. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if the answer will be revealed, and if so, what it is. In battling the cults of the Dragon Below, could you face the original shifter champions corrupted by Dyrrn? Or might the schemes of the Lords of Dust unleash the Wild Heart?": "事实是，（%0%）；它通过暴力传播，把受害者变成杀手。它的起源可能永远不会被发现，但Moonspeaker的故事和其他故事一样符合逻辑。狼人和移居者是相关的，因为第一个狼人是被诅咒的移居者。负责的未知力量很可能也是导致银色十字军的激增的幕后推手--而且它可能再次崛起。一个合理的竞争者是被称为 \"腐蚀者Dyrrn \"的daelkyr。据说Dyrrn通过扭曲变种人创造了二重身；它可能用同样的技术从变种人中创造了狼人。也可能是一个霸主的杰作，一个恶魔时代的大恶魔；一些文本中提到了 \"野心\"，一个破坏文明并以原始的残忍为食的霸主。最终，将由DM来决定是否会揭晓答案，如果是的话，答案是什么。在与下面的龙的邪教斗争中，你能否面对被Dyrrn腐蚀的原始变身者冠军？或者尘土领主的计划可能会释放出野性之心？",

But despite the stereotype, the shifters of the Towering Woods fear and fight evil lycanthropes, and their tribes include Monster Slayer rangers who specialize in hunting werewolves. Shifters and lycanthropes resemble one another, but they are not the same—and shifters are just as vulnerable to the curse of lycanthropy as humans are.": "虽然移居者和狼人并不一样，但故事和刻板印象已经很成熟了。每个人都把移位者称为 \"被动者\"。在高耸的森林之外，有许多移位者确实认为他们是薄血的狼人。而银色十字军和纯净火焰造成的创伤永远不会完全愈合。但是，尽管有这样的刻板印象，塔林的移居者还是惧怕和打击邪恶的狼人，他们的部落包括专门猎杀狼人的怪物杀手游侠。移居者和狼人彼此相似，但他们并不一样，移居者和人类一样容易受到狼人的诅咒。",
	"The {@class barbarian||Totem Warrior|totem warrior} barbarian and the {@class druid||Circle of the Shepherd|shepherd|XGE} druid are both strong choices for a shifter character. But how do the totem options overlap with your ties to the beast within? If you decide that you're a beasthide shifter with a Bear spirit, can you take Wolf as your Totem Spirit feature? Of course you can—even as a Totem Warrior, you're not bound to a single totemic beast. You could play up the idea that you feel a connection to multiple spirits. With your DM's approval, you could even have your character develop physical traits tied to your second spirit; you've always been a big, bearlike warrior, but now you manifest lupine ears and fangs when you shift.": "{@class barbarian||Totem Warrior|totem warrior}野蛮人和{@class druid||Circle of the Shepherd|shepherd|XGE}德鲁伊都是变异者角色的有力选择。但图腾的选择与你与野兽的关系是如何重叠的？如果你决定你是一个有熊精神的兽性变异者，你能把狼作为你的图腾精神特征吗？当然可以--即使作为图腾战士，你也不会被一个单一的图腾兽所束缚。你可以发挥你与多个精神有联系的想法。经DM批准，你甚至可以让你的角色发展出与你的第二种精神相关的身体特征；你一直是个大块头、像熊一样的战士，但现在你转变时表现出羽扇的耳朵和獠牙。",
	"Another option is to rename your class features to match your beast within. There's no reason you can't take the Bear option for the Totem Spirit feature but call it \"Boar\" instead. There is no Rat option for a Totem Warrior, but you could take the Eagle option and call it Rat. Ultimately this is a question of story. If you want to highlight your tie to a single spirit and it makes sense, just change the names. But there's nothing wrong with having a totem menagerie!": "另一个选择是重新命名你的阶级特征，以配合你内心的兽性。你没有理由不采用图腾精神特征的熊选项，而是将其称为 \"野猪\"。图腾战士没有 \"鼠 \"的选项，但你可以采用 \"鹰 \"的选项并称之为 \"鼠\"。归根结底，这是一个故事的问题。如果你想突出你与单一精神的联系，而且有意义，就改变名称。但是，拥有一个图腾动物群并没有什么不妥之处。",
	"As a warforged, your body was made in a Cannith forgehold. The creation forge wove rootlike muscles across a frame of metal and darkwood, bathing your body in alchemical fluids, giving you skin of steel or hardened leather. And then the miracle occurred: you came to life. You are made from wood and steel, but you are {@i alive}, aware, capable of feeling love and anger. You were born with an innate sense of your purpose, the knowledge of war burned into the back of your mind. But you aren't bound to follow the path that your creators planned for you. You have freedom. You have the ability to learn. Perhaps you even have a soul.": "作为一个战争锻造者，你的身体是在Cannith锻造厂制造的。锻造师在金属和黑木的框架上编织根状的肌肉，将你的身体浸泡在炼金术的液体中，使你拥有钢铁的皮肤或硬化的皮革。然后奇迹发生了：你活了过来。你是由木头和钢铁制成的，但你有（%0%），有意识，能够感受到爱和愤怒。你生来就有一种与生俱来的使命感，战争的知识烙印在你的脑海里。但你并没有被束缚在你的创造者为你规划的道路上。你有自由。你有学习的能力。也许你甚至有一个灵魂。",
	"As a warforged, you were created for a reason—what was it? How did you find a new purpose and become an adventurer? What do you want from life now? Are you concerned about the fate of the warforged as a species, or do you feel more of a kinship with your adventuring companions than you do with other warforged?": "作为一个战神，你被创造出来是有原因的，是什么原因呢？你是如何找到一个新的目标并成为一名冒险家的？你现在想从生活中得到什么？你是否关心战神这个物种的命运，或者你是否觉得与你的冒险伙伴之间的关系比与其他战神之间的关系更密切？",
	"The first warforged were built for battle. As Cannith refined its techniques, what started as simple infantry gave way to more sophisticated designs: lithe scouts with mithral plating, powerful juggernauts, even \"living wands\" wielding the power of sorcerers. As people grew more accustomed to these living constructs, Cannith began designing civilian warforged with a wide array of talents.": "第一批战争锻造者是为战斗而建造的。随着Cannith技术的完善，最初的简单步兵让位给了更复杂的设计：带有米塔尔合金镀层的轻巧侦察兵，强大的杂耍者，甚至是挥舞着巫师力量的 \"活魔杖\"。随着人们越来越习惯于这些活体建筑，坎尼斯开始设计具有广泛才能的民用战堡。",
	"As a warforged, you have the ability to learn, and your background and class features could reflect this. If you're a warforged bard, were you built to entertain, or were you created as a simple laborer only to discover remarkable talent within yourself? If you're a sorcerer, were you designed to channel arcane power, or is it an unexpected development? Determine your original purpose from the options below, then consider how it relates to who you are today.": "作为一个战神，你有学习的能力，你的背景和等级特征可以反映这一点。如果你是一个战神吟游诗人，你是为娱乐而生的，还是被创造为一个简单的工人，只是为了发现自己内在的非凡天赋？如果你是一个巫师，你是被设计来引导奥术力量的，还是一个意外的发展？从下面的选项中确定你最初的目的，然后考虑它与今天的你有什么关系。",
	"Like most warforged, you were designed to serve in the Last War. You didn't choose your side; you were sold to one of the Five Nations and set to work. You weren't taught to question this role—war was the only purpose you knew. Some warforged came to feel a patriotic attachment to the nation they served, despising the enemies they fought. Others felt a close bond to the officers and soldiers they served with, fighting for this \"family\" rather than for a nation. How about you? Which nation did you fight for? Do you consider yourself to be a Thrane or a Cyran, or do you have no love for the nation that bought you and threw you on the front lines?": "像大多数战争锻造者一样，你被设计为在最后的战争中服务。你没有选择自己的阵营；你被卖给了五国中的一个国家，并被安排去工作。你没有被教导去质疑这个角色--战争是你知道的唯一目的。一些战友对他们所服务的国家产生了爱国情怀，鄙视他们所战斗的敌人。其他人则对与他们一起服役的军官和士兵感到密切的联系，为这个 \"家庭 \"而不是为国家而战。你呢？你为哪个国家而战？你认为自己是瑟兰人还是锡兰人，或者你对收买你并把你扔到前线的国家没有爱？",
	"Warforged were in service for the last three decades of the war. How long did you serve? What was your most dramatic experience? Did combat leave you with lasting scars or damage, even if they have no mechanical effect on your character?": "Warforged在战争的最后三十年里一直在服役。你服役了多长时间？你最戏剧性的经历是什么？战斗是否给你留下了持久的伤痕或损害，即使它们对你的角色没有机械影响？",
	"For many warforged, class abilities reflect the role you played on the battlefield. As a fighter, you likely fought in the vanguard. As a ranger or rogue, you may have been designed as a scout. A barbarian's rage could reflect a \"battle mode\"—you don't actually get angry, but you temporarily increase your damage output and resistance. Class abilities gained over time could reflect an evolution of that design as you unlock your full potential—is this true for you, or are you developing unexpected talents?": "对于许多战神来说，等级能力反映了你在战场上扮演的角色。作为一个战士，你可能是在先锋队作战。作为一个游侠或无赖，你可能被设计成一个侦察兵。野蛮人的愤怒可能反映了一种 \"战斗模式\"--你实际上并不生气，但你会暂时增加你的伤害输出和抵抗。随着时间的推移而获得的等级能力可能反映了这种设计的演变，因为你释放了你的全部潜力--这对你来说是真的，或者你正在开发出意想不到的天赋？",
	"In the last decade of the Last War, Cannith began selling warforged to civilian organizations. This wasn't a common thing; a farmer couldn't just go to the shop and take a warforged home. But you could have served a dragonmarked house, been a bodyguard or a tutor for a noble family, or even been designed to serve as an enforcer for a criminal organization. This path provides a wide range of possible backgrounds and unusual stories. If you take the {@background noble} background, that doesn't mean you hold noble rank yourself—you could be a trusted bodyguard who's still treated as a member of the household. Perhaps a noble has made you their heir; such a thing would be unprecedented, but it would be an interesting story! With the {@background folk hero} background, you could have served as the protector of a particular village, with the story of your brave deeds spreading far and wide.": "在最后一次战争的最后十年里，坎尼斯开始向民间组织出售战争锻造者。这并不是一件常见的事情；一个农民不可能直接去商店把一个战锻人带回家。但你可以为一个有龙纹的家族服务，成为一个贵族家庭的保镖或导师，甚至被设计为犯罪组织的执行者。这条路提供了广泛的可能背景和不寻常的故事。如果你选择{@background noble}的背景，并不意味着你自己拥有贵族等级--你可能是一个值得信赖的保镖，仍然被当作家庭的一员。也许某个贵族让你成为他们的继承人；这样的事情是史无前例的，但这将是一个有趣的故事! 有了{@background folk hero}的背景，你可能担任过某个村庄的保护者，你的勇敢事迹会传得很远很远。",
	"As a civilian warforged, does your class reflect your original purpose, or have you risen beyond that? For example, you could take the {@background sage} background to reflect that you were designed to be a tutor or a researcher. You weren't built to be a wizard—but over the course of your career, you began to master the arcane, far exceeding the expectations of your creators.": "作为一个平民战神，你的等级是否反映了你最初的目的，或者你已经超越了这个目的？例如，你可以采用{@background sage}的背景来反映你被设计成一个导师或研究员。你并不是为了成为一个巫师，但在你的职业生涯中，你开始掌握了奥术，远远超过了你的创造者的期望。",
	"Warforged who served on the battlefield are forced to find a new life, because there is no war. As you weren't made for war, did the end of the war have a dramatic impact on you? The Treaty of Thronehold released you from any form of indenture, but do you still feel an attachment to your family or village? Did you ever have a sense of loyalty to a nation, or has your worldview always been shaped by the people you worked with?": "在战场上服役的战神被迫寻找新的生活，因为没有战争了。由于你不是为战争而生，战争的结束是否对你产生了巨大的影响？王权条约》使你摆脱了任何形式的契约，但你是否仍然对你的家庭或村庄感到依恋？你是否曾有过对一个国家的忠诚感，还是你的世界观一直是由与你一起工作的人塑造的？",
	"Battlefield warforged were largely mass produced. But there were many small runs of experimental warforged using specialized designs or experimental techniques. Perhaps your warforged rogue was part of a secret unit of assassins that were never deployed; how many others were in the unit, and what's become of them? As a warforged entertainer, were you built to be a superstar—and if so, how does House Phiarlan feel about that? As a druid, have you found a bond to the natural world within, or did an eccentric artificer design you with the potential to change shape and bond with natural creatures?": "战场上的战神基本上都是大规模生产的。但也有许多小规模的实验性战堡使用专门的设计或实验性技术。也许你的战争锻造的流氓是一个秘密的刺客单位的一部分，但从未被部署；有多少其他人在这个单位，他们变得怎么样了？作为一个战神的艺人，你是为了成为一个超级明星而生的吗？作为一个德鲁伊，你是否在内心深处找到了与自然世界的联系，或者是一个古怪的工匠设计了你，让你有可能改变形状并与自然生物结合？",
	"In developing an exotic warforged, talk with your DM to develop details about your creator and your purpose. Are you one of a kind or part of a small run? Do you know who built you and why, or is your true purpose a mystery even to you?": "在开发一个异国情调的战神时，要与你的DM交谈，以发展关于你的创造者和你的目的的细节。你是独一无二的还是属于小规模的？你知道是谁建造了你，为什么建造你，还是你的真正目的甚至对你来说都是个谜？",
	"Cannith artificers designed your body and made you for a purpose. When the creation forge imbued you with life, there were things you {@i knew}. If you were built to be a warrior, you knew how to wield a sword and pike. You had an instinctive sense of squad tactics. There were things Cannith instructors had to teach you, but even there, it felt almost as if they were reminding you of things you already knew.": "Cannith工匠们设计了你的身体，并为一个目的制造了你。当造物主把你的生命灌输给你的时候，就有了你的东西（%0%）。如果你是为了成为一名战士，你知道如何挥舞剑和长矛。你对小队的战术有一种本能的感觉。有些东西是坎尼斯教官必须教给你的，但即使在那里，感觉上也是他们在提醒你已经知道的东西。",
	"This is one of the mysteries of the warforged. Where does your sentience come from? Cannith gave direction, but they didn't design your mind; if they could, they'd have made you without emotion, and likely without the capacity for true independence. Many arcane scholars theorize that the creation forges don't create the warforged mind, but rather summon it. Some believe that the warforged soul is drawn from the planes, that a warforged soldier is infused with the essence of Shavarath. Others suggest that the creation forges could be recycling husks from Dolurrh... perhaps the reason you sometimes feel that you're remembering new skills is because you possessed those skills in a former life.": "这也是战神的奥秘之一。你的知觉从何而来？坎尼斯提供了方向，但他们并没有设计你的思想；如果他们可以，他们会让你没有情感，而且很可能没有真正的独立能力。许多奥术学者理论上认为，创造锻造并没有创造出战神的思想，而是将其召唤出来。有些人认为，战神的灵魂来自于各个星球，一个战神的士兵被注入了沙瓦拉斯的精华。还有人认为，创世锻工可能是来自多鲁尔的回收壳......也许你有时觉得你记住了新技能的原因是你在前世拥有这些技能。",
	"Regardless, your Cannith instructors taught you to focus solely on the purpose they gave you. They trained you to suppress emotions, to be a weapon or a tool. Now you are free, able to explore your full potential. What does this mean for you? You can feel a full range of emotions, but do you? Or are you mystified by anger and love? What do you actually care about? Do you feel loyalty to a particular person? To a nation? To the future of the warforged race? Some warforged revel in the ability to choose a new path; others hold fast to their original purpose, and just want a reason to put those skills to work.": "不管怎么说，你的坎尼斯教官教你只专注于他们赋予你的目的。他们训练你压制情绪，成为一种武器或工具。现在你是自由的，能够探索你的全部潜力。这对你意味着什么？你可以感受到全方位的情绪，但你会吗？还是你被愤怒和爱所迷惑？你真正关心的是什么？你对某一个人感到忠诚吗？对一个国家？对战神种族的未来？一些战神陶醉于选择新的道路的能力；另一些战神则坚守他们最初的目的，只是想找一个理由把这些技能用于工作。",
	"Warforged aren't machines; they're living, magical beings, and can evolve both physically and mentally. Just as you can learn new skills, your body can transform over time. This is one way to reflect class benefits; can you think of a way that your body could physically change to account for a new ability? If you gain the Defense Fighting Style, that might reflect your natural armor becoming thicker. If you're a warforged sorcerer, the ability to cast new spells could be reflected by arcane sigils appearing on your body, or by growing crystals that project light or energy. Never forget that you're the product of magic as well as science. You may be made of metal and leather, but you're also alive.": "战神不是机器；他们是活生生的魔法生物，可以在身体和精神上进行进化。就像你可以学习新的技能一样，你的身体可以随着时间的推移而改变。这是反映等级优势的一种方式；你能想到你的身体可以通过什么方式来改变，以适应新的能力吗？如果你获得了防御战斗风格，这可能反映出你的天然盔甲变得更厚。如果你是一个战神级的巫师，施展新法术的能力可以通过你身上出现的奥术符号来反映，或者通过生长出投射光或能量的晶体来反映。永远不要忘记，你是魔法和科学的产物。你可能是由金属和皮革制成的，但你也是活着的。",
	"As a warforged, your armor is a part of you. Your skin is metal or leather, physically bonded to the rootlike tendrils that serve as your muscles. While it is possible for you to change your armor, very few warforged actually ever do this. The process is similar to a human peeling off their skin; while it's not dangerous for the warforged, it's a disturbing and uncomfortable experience. As an adventuring warforged, it's an important ability to have, as it allows you to improve your defense and to make use of magical armor. But be aware of the weight of what you're doing when you exchange your armor.": "作为一个战争锻造者，你的盔甲是你的一部分。你的皮肤是金属或皮革，与作为你肌肉的根状卷须物理性地结合在一起。虽然你有可能改变你的盔甲，但很少有战神真正做到这一点。这个过程类似于人类剥去他们的皮肤；虽然这对战神来说并不危险，但这是个令人不安和不舒服的经历。作为一个冒险的战神，这是一个重要的能力，因为它可以让你提高你的防御力，并利用魔法盔甲。但在交换盔甲时要注意你所做的事情的重量。",
	"Once you have integrated a suit of armor, it cannot be removed against your will. However, you are still considered to be wearing armor for purposes of the Defense Fighting Style or other feats and benefits that relate to armor. Likewise, integrated armor can be targeted by magical effects. The Juggernaut Plating feat presented in chapter 6 enhances your integrated armor and protects it from hostile magic.": "一旦你整合了一套盔甲，它就不能违背你的意愿被移除。然而，就防御战斗风格或其他与盔甲有关的功绩和利益而言，你仍然被认为是穿着盔甲。同样地，整合后的盔甲可以被魔法效果所针对。第6章中介绍的Juggernaut Plating特技可以增强你的综合装甲，并保护它不受敌对魔法的影响。",
	"Just as a warforged can bond to armor or weapons, it's possible to attach a tool to its body. There are two ways to do this. The first is to acquire an {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}. As presented in chapter 7, this is a common magic item that requires attunement; through attuning the tool, you bond it to your body. An alternative is to take the {@feat Envoy Specialist|ExploringEberron} feat found in chapter 6. This gives you the benefit of an attached tool without requiring attunement.": "就像战神可以与盔甲或武器结合一样，也可以将工具附在其身上。有两种方法可以做到这一点。第一种是获得一个（%0%）。正如第七章所介绍的，这是一个需要调和的普通魔法物品；通过调和工具，你将它与你的身体结合起来。另一个选择是参加第六章中的（1%）壮举。这可以让你获得附加工具的好处，而不需要调和。",
	"Unlike an {@item armblade|ERLW}, an {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron} represents more than just having a hammer attached to your hand. Most tools don't represent one single object, but rather, a range of smaller items. How does this manifest with you? If you have a set of integrated thieves' tools, do you use your fingers as lockpicks? Or do you draw the various tools you need out of compartments in your forearm? If you have an integrated instrument, is it built into your arm or your torso? Whatever you decide, remember that you have to have a hand free in order to make use of an integrated tool. You can say that your bagpipes are built into your chest, but you still need a free hand to play them.": "与{@item armblade|ERLW}不同的是，{@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}代表的不仅仅是在你的手上有一把锤子。大多数工具并不代表一个单一的物体，而是代表一系列较小的物品。这在你身上是如何体现的？如果你有一套集成的盗贼工具，你是用你的手指作为开锁工具？还是从你前臂的夹层中抽出你需要的各种工具？如果你有一套综合工具，它是内置于你的手臂还是你的躯干？无论你做出什么决定，请记住，你必须有一只手空出来，才能利用综合工具。你可以说你的风笛是内置在你的胸部，但你仍然需要一只自由的手来演奏它。",
	"An {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron} can be an interesting part of a character concept that reflects the purpose a warforged was built for. A warforged outlander could have a set of cartographer's tools built into her body; she was designed to explore, using her integrated tools and innate sense of direction to constantly update her maps. A warforged entertainer with an integrated flute is a compelling image. In both cases, it's not that the warforged acquires the tool, but rather, it was part of their original design. If you have an interesting origin story, you can see if your DM will allow you to take a tool you possess at character generation as an {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}. If not, integrated tools are common magic items and can be easily acquired over the course of your adventures.": "一个{@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}可以是角色概念中一个有趣的部分，它反映了一个战神被建造的目的。一个被锻造的外乡人可以在她的身体里内置一套制图工具；她被设计用来探索，使用她的综合工具和天生的方向感来不断地更新她的地图。一个集成了笛子的战神艺人是一个引人注目的形象。在这两种情况下，并不是战神获得了这个工具，而是它是他们最初设计的一部分。如果你有一个有趣的起源故事，你可以看看你的管理员是否会允许你在角色生成时把你拥有的工具作为一个（%1%）。如果没有，综合工具是常见的魔法物品，可以在你的冒险过程中轻易获得。",
	"When creating a warforged character, a simple place to start is to ask: What did you do during the war? How have you changed since it ended? Did you choose the path you're on, or were you designed for it? Chapter 6 includes two new subclasses that a warforged could explore. The Living Weapon monk could be a warforged whose abilities reflect physical evolution combined with martial discipline. The Circle of the Forged is a druid path that lets you explore your connection to the natural world while remaining a creature of wood and stone. Here are a few other unusual concepts.": "当创建一个战友角色时，一个简单的开始是问：你在战争期间做了什么？战争结束后你有什么变化？是你选择了你现在的道路，还是你被设计成这样的？第六章包括两个新的子类，战神可以探索。活体武器僧侣可以是一个战争锻造者，他的能力反映了身体进化与武术纪律的结合。锻造之环是一个德鲁伊之路，让你在保持木石之躯的同时探索你与自然世界的联系。这里有一些其他不寻常的概念。",
	"You were made by human hands. There are many who believe that you have no soul, that you're just a tool. What would draw you to a religion and imbue you with the faith required to channel divine magic?

As a {@class cleric||Forge|forge|XGE} cleric, you might believe that the warforged weren't designed by a mortal mind; rather, Aaren d'Cannith was guided by divine inspiration to bring Onatar's children into the world.

Or do you believe that the warforged have their own divine purpose that has yet to be fulfilled?": "奥纳塔是锻造之主，是铁匠和工匠的守护者。作为一个{@class cleric||Forge|forge|XGE}牧师，你可能会相信，战神并不是由凡人的思想设计出来的；相反，阿伦-德-坎尼斯在神圣的灵感指引下，将奥纳塔的孩子带到了这个世界。你想把人类和战神带到一起，促进和平共处？或者你相信战神有他们自己的神圣目的，但尚未实现？",

Meanwhile, in the far northeast, a small but devoted following held to the teachings of the Blood of Vol.": "数百年来，主权宿主一直是加利法尔和五国的信仰基石。但几个世纪以来，裂缝开始形成。在瑟兰，一位年轻的圣骑士将这个国家从恶魔的统治中解救出来，并将她的胜利归功于一种古老的光明力量。她所拯救的人们很快就接受了银色火焰的信仰，并逐渐扩散到整个加利法尔。与此同时，在遥远的东北部，一个小而忠实的追随者坚持沃尔之血的教义。",
	"Some scholars say that the growing power of industry and arcane science weakened faith. Why should a blacksmith make an offering to Onatar when he could use his copper to take Cannith courses and learn {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron}? Others say that the Last War is to blame. Whatever the cause, there are certainly many in Khorvaire who have no deep devotion to any religion. None would deny that divine power exists, but in a world with sorcerers and dragonmarks, the ability to perform magic is no assurance of the existence of gods. But many faithful see no conflict between the wonders of the modern age and their devotions. Even House Cannith has always claimed to prosper through the blessing of Onatar, and there have always been those within the house who have asked the Traveler for dangerous inspiration. While the Mourning caused some people to question their beliefs, for others, their faith was the source of stability and comfort in a bleak world: {@i Whatever horrors we face, surely there is a reason for our suffering... a divine purpose we can't yet understand.}": "一些学者说，工业和神秘科学的力量不断增强，削弱了信仰。当一个铁匠可以用他的铜钱参加坎尼斯课程并学习时，他为什么要向奥纳塔提供祭品（%0%）？还有人说，最后的战争是罪魁祸首。不管是什么原因，在霍尔韦尔肯定有很多人对任何宗教都没有深刻的虔诚。没有人会否认神力的存在，但在一个有巫师和龙纹的世界里，施展魔法的能力并不能保证神的存在。但许多信徒认为现代的奇迹与他们的虔诚之间没有冲突。甚至坎尼斯家族也一直声称是通过奥纳塔的祝福而繁荣起来的，而且家族中一直有人向旅行者寻求危险的灵感。虽然哀伤使一些人对自己的信仰产生了怀疑，但对另一些人来说，他们的信仰是暗淡世界中稳定和安慰的来源：{@i Whatever horrors we face, surely there is a reason for our suffering... a divine purpose we can't yet understand.}",
	"This chapter examines the role of divine power in daily life and explores the differences between arcane and divine magic. It examines the three major religions of Khorvaire and delves into the occult mysteries of the cults of the Dragon Below. It concludes with revelations about the {@race aasimar|VGM} and their place in the world of Eberron.": "本章研究了神力在日常生活中的作用，并探讨了奥术和神术的区别。它研究了霍尔韦尔的三大宗教，并深入探讨了龙下的邪教的神秘之处。最后，它对{@race aasimar|VGM}和他们在Eberron世界中的地位进行了揭示。",
	"While scholars debate if the Sovereigns truly exist, the presence of divine forces can be felt in everyday life. This is more pronounced in specific places—Thrane, Aerenal, a Seeker community in Karrnath—but even on the cynical streets of Breland, you can consult an oracle of Aureon or get help from an exorcist of the Silver Flame. Similarly, people may criticize the actions of the Church of the Silver Flame, but no one doubts that the Flame itself exists, and everyone knows that its champions wield mystic power. Player characters are remarkable, and paladins are rare, but it's common knowledge that paladins exist. When a paladin heals a wounded soldier by laying on hands, it's impressive, but not unprecedented. How is divine power encountered in the world, and how does it differ from the magic of wizards and artificers?": "虽然学者们争论主权者是否真的存在，但在日常生活中可以感受到神性力量的存在。这在特定的地方更为明显--特拉恩、艾瑞纳、卡尔纳特的一个探索者社区--但即使是在布雷兰玩世不恭的街道上，你也可以咨询奥瑞恩的神谕或从银焰的驱魔人那里获得帮助。同样地，人们可能会批评银色火焰教会的行为，但没有人怀疑银色火焰本身的存在，而且每个人都知道它的拥护者拥有神秘的力量。玩家角色是了不起的，而圣骑士是罕见的，但圣骑士的存在是众所周知的。当一个圣骑士通过按手治疗一个受伤的士兵时，这令人印象深刻，但并不是前所未有的。神圣的力量在这个世界上是如何遇到的，它与巫师和工匠的魔法有什么不同？",
	"A cleric, a bard, and an artificer can all cast cure wounds. Working strictly by the rules, the only difference between the three characters is the spellcasting ability associated with each, so arcane and divine magic aren't concrete mechanical concepts. Rather, it is part of the story itself, with the artificer and cleric each doing something fundamentally different; the artificer creates a quick healing salve, while the cleric lays their hands on the victim and calls for a miracle. This section explores the difference between arcane and divine magic, suggesting flavor that you can employ in describing the actions of spellcasters.": "牧师、吟游诗人和工匠都可以施展治伤术。严格按照规则行事，这三个角色之间的唯一区别是与每个角色相关的施法能力，所以奥术和神术并不是具体的机械概念。相反，它是故事本身的一部分，工匠和牧师各自做着根本不同的事情；工匠创造了一种快速治疗的药膏，而牧师则将他们的手放在受害者身上，呼唤神迹。本节探讨了奥术和神术之间的区别，提出了你在描述施法者的行为时可以采用的风味。",
	"While much of this chapter is applicable to both players and DMs, some information lies ahead that isn't common knowledge to most player characters. Even characters with proficiency in Religion don't automatically know the deep lore of their faith; for example, most clerics devoted to the Blood of Vol don't know how Erandis Vol is connected to it. As a player, recognize that your character is unlikely to know all the things you're about to read, and work with your DM to determine how much they know about their religion and its secrets.": "虽然本章的大部分内容对玩家和DM都适用，但有些信息对大多数玩家角色来说并不是常识。即使是精通宗教的角色也不会自动知道他们信仰的深层传说；例如，大多数致力于沃尔之血的牧师不知道埃兰迪斯-沃尔是如何与之相连的。作为玩家，要认识到你的角色不可能知道你将要读到的所有东西，并与你的DM合作，确定他们对自己的宗教及其秘密了解多少。",
	"It's also important to note that the faiths of Eberron have been presented in different ways over the course of different books and editions of the game. As a DM, it's up to you to decide what's true in your campaign. And as a player, keep in mind that your DM may not take this book as gospel! This chapter is meant as a source of inspiration, not as absolute truth.": "同样重要的是要注意，在游戏的不同书籍和版本中，Eberron的信仰以不同的方式呈现。作为一个管理员，你要决定在你的活动中什么是真实的。而作为玩家，请记住，你的DM可能不会把这本书当作福音 本章是作为灵感的来源，而不是绝对真理。",
	"Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this is dangerous and exhausting; this is why most spellcasters are limited in how many spells they can cast each day.": "奥术魔法是一种科学形式。有可预测的规则来塑造现实，通过适当的学习和意志力，任何人都有可能施展奥术魔法。这就是奥术魔法成为五国文明基础的原因：它可以被教授，而且一旦学会，就完全可靠。奥术魔法涉及到引导周围的魔法能量--各星球的力量、西伯利亚之环的散发--并将其集中起来改变现实。咒语的组成部分--如口头咒语、身体手势和重点物品--有助于这一过程，但咒语最重要的元素是精神集中。尽管一个战士可以完美地复制一个巫师的语言和手势，但什么也不会发生。你必须在心中施法，驾驭和塑造神秘的能量，这很危险，也很累人；这就是为什么大多数施法者每天能施放的法术数量有限。",
	"All arcane magic consists of reliable skills you can master, but there are different forms of arcane magic. While a wizard and sorcerer can both cast fireball, there's a difference, tied to the ability associated with spellcasting.": "所有的奥术魔法都由你可以掌握的可靠技能组成，但有不同形式的奥术魔法。虽然魔法师和巫师都可以施放火球术，但还是有区别的，与施法的相关能力有关。",
	"Spellcasting using Intelligence is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you're looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you're doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you're a scientist.": "使用智力的施法是以知识和逻辑为基础的。对这些人物来说，施法就像解方程一样--利用并仔细引导所需的精确数量的神秘能量，以产生你所寻找的效果。巫师可以使用力量的语言和神秘的手势来产生力量，而工匠则依靠工具。但无论如何，你从根本上知道自己在做什么，这就是为什么工匠和巫师都可以每天准备新的法术。奥术魔法是一门科学，而你是一位科学家。",
	"Spellcasting using Charisma is tied to instinct and force of personality. For these characters, casting a spell is like knowing a few amazing family recipes even though you have no concept of the fundamental principles of baking. Your spellcasting talents may come from an arcane bloodline, a mystic patron, or a magical song. Regardless, you still have to perform similar actions to a wizard; to cast a {@spell fireball}, you still need somatic gestures and verbal incantations along with a ball of guano or an arcane focus. But you don't have to understand what you're doing the way a wizard does; you just know that if you follow the recipe, you'll get a perfect result.": "使用魅力的施法与本能和人格力量相联系。对这些人物来说，施法就像知道一些惊人的家庭食谱，尽管你对烘焙的基本原理没有概念。你的法术天赋可能来自于一个神秘的血统，一个神秘的赞助人，或者一首神奇的歌曲。不管怎么说，你仍然要执行与巫师类似的动作；要施放一个（%0%），你仍然需要身体的手势和口头的咒语，以及一个鸟粪球或一个奥术焦点。但你不必像巫师那样理解你在做什么；你只知道如果你按照配方，你会得到一个完美的结果。",
	"In general, wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, artificers, bards, wandslingers, and magewrights use arcane magic. This still leaves room for individual flavor, and the techniques of an Aereni wizard may look quite different from those of an Aundairian wandslinger. But the same basic science underlies them both, and the principles of verbal and somatic components are familiar, even if the precise gestures or words are different. You can decide your character breaks this tradition, but this doesn't change any mechanical rules. You might say that your bard uses divine magic to cast spells—singing prayers to the Sovereigns, for example. However, this won't change your spellcasting ability or allow you to use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, unless you make arrangements with your DM.": "一般来说，魔法师、巫师、术士、工匠、吟游诗人、魔杖手和魔法师都使用奥术魔法。这仍然为个人风格留下了空间，Aereni巫师的技术可能与Aundairian巫师的技术有很大不同。但它们都是以相同的基本科学为基础的，即使精确的手势或话语不同，但语言和肢体成分的原则是熟悉的。你可以决定你的角色打破这一传统，但这并不改变任何机械规则。你可以说你的吟游诗人使用神圣的魔法来施法--比如说，向君主祈祷。然而，这不会改变你的法术能力，也不允许你使用神圣的符号作为法术的焦点，除非你与你的DM作出安排。",
	"There's no logic to divine magic, no pure science that can explain exactly how it works. An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can't even read might feel Onatar's guiding hands and cast {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron}. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.": "神圣的魔法没有逻辑，没有纯粹的科学可以确切地解释它是如何运作的。一个圣徒可能会花数年时间冥想和祈祷，做善事，照看羊群，但仍然无法获得施法的力量；与此同时，一个甚至不识字的铁匠可能会感受到奥纳塔的指导之手并施法（%0%）。神圣的魔法需要两样东西：绝对的信仰和与神圣力量来源的联系。",
	"Faith is about conviction. It can't be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you're smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn't mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can't think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.": "信仰是关于信念的。它不可能是你理性地对待的东西。你需要从心底里知道，你想用咒语产生的魔法效果应该而且会发生。无论你是在打击敌人还是治疗盟友，你都知道敌人会倒下，你会拯救你的朋友。这并不意味着你必须是一个没有任何疑虑的狂热者；你可以质疑你的整体行动方案。但在施法的那一刻，你不能考虑你的疑虑；在那一瞬间，你必须有纯粹的、绝对的确定性，相信这个法术会实现的。",
	"But faith alone isn't enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if Onatar actually guides all artisans or if Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not Dol Arrah exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be Dol Arrah granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who's spent decades studying texts doesn't? People of faith usually respond that it's because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that's true, or maybe it's all just luck.": "但仅有信仰是不够的；你还需要与神力的来源有联系。在Eberron，没有人能够证明主权者或其他神灵是否存在--如果Onatar真的指导所有工匠，或者Dol Dorn和Dol Arrah是否真的看守着每个战场。但无论多尔-阿拉是否存在，当她的圣骑士击打敌人时，他们从某种东西中汲取了力量。圣骑士相信那是多尔-阿拉赫给予她的恩惠，也许是这样。或者，成千上万相信圣主的人的共同信仰在集体无意识中创造了力量之井，而圣骑士则从这种强大的力量中汲取了力量。在实际意义上，真相并不重要；无论其性质和来源如何，力量都存在。而这正是科学失败的地方。银色火焰是神圣力量的源泉，这股力量几千年来一直遏制着恶魔。那些寻求保护无辜者和打击超自然邪恶的人可以利用它的力量。但是，为什么一个圣殿骑士会成为圣骑士而不是另一个具有同等信仰的人？为什么一个不识字的农民能获得神圣魔法的天赋，而一个花了几十年时间研究文本的宗教学者却不能？有信仰的人通常会回答说，这是因为农夫被阿拉威选中，或者因为一个圣殿骑士比另一个更容易接受火焰之声。也许那是真的，也许这一切只是运气。",
	"As a paladin or cleric, you are tied to a source of divine power. Have you been chosen for a grand purpose? Did you earn this gift through piety or virtue? No one can prove the answer one way or the other. All that matters is that you have your faith, and that when you call for divine power, something answers.": "作为一名圣骑士或牧师，你与神圣力量的源泉紧密相连。你被选中是为了一个宏伟的目的吗？你是否通过虔诚或美德获得了这种天赋？没有人可以证明答案是这样或那样的。重要的是你有你的信仰，而且当你呼唤神力时，有东西回应。",
	"To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: \"Dol Arrah smite my foe!\" or \"Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!\" Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn't just ask for something; they reach out and {@i take} the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it'll be exhausted until they can rest.": "对外部观察者来说，神圣的魔法与奥术魔法的味道非常不同。巫师描画发光的符号，用比人类更古老的语言说话；牧师则只是戏剧性地指向他们的敌人，呼唤银色的火焰将他们击倒。然而，无论一个咒语是由奥术还是神力推动的，它仍然需要语言和身体的成分。实际上，这意味着施法者必须能够说话和使用他们的手，而且这些都与施法有某种联系。但是，当一个巫师可能背诵复杂的咒语时，神圣魔法的语言成分可能是最简单的祈祷。\"多尔-阿拉赫打倒我的敌人！\"或 \"在火焰的光芒中站起来！\" 或者它可能更复杂，也许是唱一首赞美诗或背诵一段古文。在这两种情况下，言语成分都是信念和意图的陈述。就像奥术魔法不仅仅是语言和手势一样，神圣的魔法也同样有精神成分。施法者不只是要求什么；他们伸出手来，从神圣的源头获得{@i take}的力量，如果他们过于依赖这种联系，它将被耗尽，直到他们可以休息。",
	"Mechanically, there's no difference between arcane magic and divine magic. But Eberron's divine magic is inherently more mysterious—it's not a science and shouldn't be entirely consistent or reliable. If you and your DM both agree to it, the DM could add some uncertainty to your divine magic. Consider a few ways this could manifest:": "从机制上讲，奥术魔法和神圣魔法之间没有区别。但是Eberron的神术本来就比较神秘--它不是一门科学，不应该完全一致或可靠。如果你和你的DM都同意，DM可以为你的神术添加一些不确定性。考虑一下这可能表现的几种方式。",
	"A spell could have a more powerful effect than you expected, as if cast with a spell slot of a higher level.": "一个法术可能具有比你预期的更强大的效果，就像用更高等级的法术槽施放一样。",
	"The target of a spell could gain advantage or disadvantage on a saving throw against it.": "咒语的目标可以在对它的救赎中获得优势或劣势。",
	"A target could be unexpectedly included or excluded from a spell effect.": "一个目标可能被意外地纳入或排除在法术效果之外。",
	"This uncertainty should never become commonplace. It's the sort of thing that might happen once or twice during an adventure, if at all, and it should never be something you demand. It's a way to add that sense that divine magic isn't logical—not to create a concrete advantage or disadvantage for divine casters.": "这种不确定性不应该成为普遍现象。这是一种在冒险中可能会发生一两次的事情，如果有的话，它不应该成为你要求的东西。这是一种增加神圣魔法不符合逻辑的感觉的方法，而不是为神圣施法者创造具体的优势或劣势。",
	"You should generally have a sense of why the uncertainty is happening. If you doubt the righteousness of your cause, it would make sense for you to have disadvantage on your attack roll; conversely, if you're a Silver Flame priest facing one of the Lords of Dust and you've just made an impassioned speech condemning them in the name of the Flame, you might expect a surge in power. But divine magic should never be entirely logical. If you cast {@spell flame strike} and one of the targets is entirely untouched, is it because your faith faltered, or could it be a sign that you are supposed to spare this person's life?": "一般来说，你应该对不确定性的发生有一种感觉。如果你怀疑自己事业的正义性，那么你在攻击卷上处于劣势也是合理的；反之，如果你是一个银焰牧师，面对尘土领主之一，而你刚刚以火焰的名义发表了慷慨激昂的演讲谴责他们，你可能会期待力量的激增。但神圣的魔法永远不应该是完全合乎逻辑的。如果你施放了{@spell flame strike}，而其中一个目标完全没有受到影响，这是因为你的信仰动摇了，还是可能是你应该饶恕这个人生命的迹象？",
	"As a divine caster, you are in touch with a divine power source. DMs can add a sense of mystery to divine magic by granting you divine visions. This might be clear and direct: during a long rest, you have a vision of a dark cloud over a nearby town. You know that evil forces are gathering there and that you have been charged to defend the townsfolk. This can be an easy way to set an adventure in motion. But it can also be more cryptic and intriguing: as your paladin enters the village, you see a burning crown floating above the head of a crippled beggar. The vision lasts an instant and is gone, with no further guidance. Is it a sign that the beggar is the rightful ruler and you should restore him to power? Is it a warning that he's an agent of Rak Tulkhesh? There is no clear answer; it's up to you to interpret it. The divine power is telling you something, but can your mortal mind make sense of it? As with unreliable magic, visions should be rare and remarkable. Such a vision is a reminder that you are in touch with a higher power, but you should never take this gift for granted or come to expect it.": "作为一个神圣的施法者，你与一个神圣的力量源泉相联系。管理员可以通过赋予你神圣的幻象来为神圣的魔法增加神秘感。这可能是清晰而直接的：在长时间的休息中，你看到了附近城镇上空的一片乌云。你知道邪恶势力正聚集在那里，而你被责成去保卫镇民。这可以是一个简单的方法来启动一个冒险。但它也可以更隐蔽、更耐人寻味：当你的圣骑士进入村庄时，你看到一个燃烧的王冠漂浮在一个跛脚的乞丐头上。这个异象持续了一瞬间就消失了，没有进一步的指引。这是否预示着这个乞丐是合法的统治者，你应该恢复他的权力？是警告他是拉克-图尔克什的代理人吗？没有明确的答案；这取决于你的解释。神圣的力量在告诉你一些事情，但你的凡人之心能理解它吗？就像不可靠的魔法一样，异象应该是罕见的、非凡的。这样的异象是提醒你与更高的力量接触，但你千万不要把这种天赋视为理所当然，或者来期待它。",
	"Divine magic and arcane magic are the two most common forms of spellcasting, but they're far from the only paths. Primal magic draws on the ambient power of the natural world, and is commonly used by druids and rangers. The verbal components of a primal spell might include a bird call or invocation of an animal spirit; somatic components might mimic the motion of a beast or spreading roots. Psionic magic uses the focused power of the mind, and chapter 2 includes suggestions for adding psionic flavor to kalashtar characters. A warlock might say that they are directly channeling their patron, acting simply as a vessel for that power.": "神圣魔法和奥术魔法是两种最常见的施法形式，但它们远不是唯一的途径。原始魔法借助于自然界的环境力量，通常由德鲁伊和游侠使用。原始法术的语言成分可能包括鸟叫或对动物精神的召唤；身体成分可能模仿野兽的运动或蔓延的根系。幻术使用的是心灵的集中力量，第二章包括为卡拉什塔人物增加幻术风味的建议。一个术士可能会说，他们是在直接引导他们的守护者，只是作为该力量的一个容器。",
	"Faith is a part of everyday life in the Five Nations. The people of Galifar were devoted to the Sovereign Host, and this echoes through its institutions—marriages are sanctified by Boldrei and judges swear oaths to Aureon. The Sovereign Aureon is the patron of wizards and magewrights, and Cannith artificers look to Onatar and the Traveler for inspiration. Many dragonmarked heirs assert that their marks are divine gifts.": "在五国，信仰是日常生活的一部分。加利法尔的人民献身于主宰者，这一点在其机构中得到了回响--婚姻由波德莱赋予神圣性，法官向奥里昂宣誓。主权者奥瑞恩是巫师和魔法师的守护神，坎尼斯的工匠们向奥纳塔和旅行者寻求灵感。许多有龙纹的继承人宣称他们的龙纹是神圣的礼物。",
	"So faith remains widespread, and there is no inherent clash between arcane and divine magic, but most commercial magical services are provided by arcane magewrights, not divine adepts. Priests can often cast {@spell thaumaturgy} or {@spell ceremony}, but rarely wield other forms of magic. The job of the priest is to provide spiritual guidance to their community; if you're looking to fix your injured leg, you go to a Jorasco healing house, not to a temple.": "所以信仰仍然很普遍，奥术和神术之间没有内在的冲突，但大多数商业魔法服务是由奥术师提供的，而不是神术师。牧师通常可以施展（%0%）或（%1%），但很少挥舞其他形式的魔法。牧师的工作是为他们的社区提供精神指导；如果你想修复你的伤腿，你会去Jorasco疗养院，而不是去寺庙。",
	"As a result, people are well aware of divine magic, but it's not taken for granted in the same way arcane magic is. The people of Eberron understand that divine magic isn't necessarily reliable, as discussed in the \"Gifts in Time of Need\" sidebar. A paladin player character will never lose their class abilities, but an NPC templar might gain divine power only when fighting supernatural evil and be unable to produce those effects at other times.": "因此，人们很清楚神圣的魔法，但它不像奥术魔法那样被认为是理所当然的。Eberron的人们明白，神圣的魔法不一定可靠，正如在 \"需要时的礼物 \"边栏中所讨论的。一个圣骑士角色永远不会失去他们的等级能力，但一个NPC圣殿骑士可能只有在与超自然的邪恶战斗时才能获得神力，而在其他时候则无法产生这些效果。",
	"People with the abilities of clerics and paladins are usually found serving as champions of their faiths. They are exorcists, templar commanders, inquisitors, and missionaries venturing into dangerous lands. You wouldn't just go into a temple of Boldrei and demand to be healed. Clerics and paladins are remarkable, and people will assume that you were given your powers for a special purpose. NPC clerics of Boldrei might be found operating charitable clinics or fighting outbreaks of plague.": "拥有牧师和圣骑士能力的人通常会被发现作为他们信仰的拥护者。他们是驱魔人、圣殿骑士团指挥官、审问者，以及进入危险地区的传教士。你不会随便进入波德莱的神庙，要求得到治疗。牧师和圣骑士都很了不起，人们会认为你被赋予了特殊的力量。波德莱的神职人员可能会被发现经营慈善诊所或对抗瘟疫的爆发。",
	"Long ago, a simple smith received Onatar's blessing, and from then on, found he could use divine magic to cast magecraft. When a gang of bandits threatened his village, the old man struck down the bandit leader, then smote those who didn't flee. He exclaimed that Dol Arrah and Boldrei empowered him to protect his people. But when the bandits fled, this strength left him and he died.": "很久以前，一个普通的铁匠得到了奥纳塔的祝福，从那时起，他发现自己可以用神力来施展魔法了。当一伙强盗威胁到他的村庄时，这位老人击倒了强盗首领，然后击倒了那些没有逃跑的人。他感叹道，多尔-阿拉和波德莱赋予他保护人民的权力。但当强盗们逃跑时，这种力量离开了他，他就死了。",
	"This is a typical folktale in the Five Nations. You can't choose to become a divine spellcaster; the power is given to you. While some say this proves the existence of divine intervention, others assert it's simply that deep devotion allows anyone to channel divine power under the right circumstances. In some cases, divine power can be temporarily granted by an immortal entity, as the paladin Tira Miron was strengthened in her battle against Bel Shalor by a couatl guardian.": "这是五国的一个典型的民间故事。你不能选择成为一个神圣的施法者；力量是给你的。虽然有人说这证明了神的干预的存在，但也有人断言这只是深层的奉献允许任何人在适当的情况下引导神的力量。在某些情况下，神力可以由一个不朽的实体暂时授予，就像圣骑士提拉-米隆在与贝尔-沙洛的战斗中被一个库阿特尔守护者加强。",
	"Player characters rarely have power stripped away; their core abilities should be reliable unless the player and DM agree to add uncertainty to their abilities. But NPCs could receive temporary divine gifts; the old smith described above could be a vital ally in a battle, but at the end of the adventure, his powers leave him. In the case of a player character, any character with faith could temporarily receive a boon (as presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) tied to a particular quest or purpose. That purpose might be made clear—gifted by a spiritual guide like Tira's couatl, or revealed in a divine vision—or it could be a mystery. Such a gift is temporary, and will be lost when it has served its purpose. This sort of gift should be especially rare and remarkable; Tira and the couatl is a legendary event, not something taken for granted. But it is something that can happen if it fits an adventure.": "玩家角色很少被剥夺力量；他们的核心能力应该是可靠的，除非玩家和DM同意给他们的能力增加不确定性。但NPC可以得到临时的神赐；上面描述的老铁匠可能是一场战斗中的重要盟友，但在冒险结束时，他的力量会离开他。在玩家角色的情况下，任何有信仰的角色都可以暂时得到一个与特定任务或目的相关的恩赐（如（%0%）中提出的）。这个目的可能是明确的--由像提拉的库阿特尔这样的精神向导赋予的，或者在一个神圣的愿景中揭示的，或者它可能是一个神秘的。这样的礼物是暂时的，当它完成了它的目的后就会失去。这种礼物应该是特别罕见和了不起的；提拉和库阿特尔是一个传奇性的事件，不是理所当然的事情。但是，如果符合冒险的要求，它是可以发生的。",
	"While it's rare to find people selling divine magic as a service, it's not unheard of. Breland is infamous for corruption, and an NPC cleric could demand gold for mystical assistance. Oracles of Aureon typically demand \"donations\" for their insights. And in places where faith is especially strong or widespread, adepts can be found providing services commonly performed by magewrights. In a Seeker community in Karrnath, you may find skeletons animated by the local priest tilling a field. A devout blacksmith might cast {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron} by calling on Onatar instead of learning it from Cannith—but unlike with arcane magic, this devout blacksmith can't teach the spell to an apprentice. Divine spellcasting is a gift, not a job; an apprentice might earn that gift with their own devotion, but it's never a sure thing.": "虽然很少发现有人把神圣的魔法作为一种服务来出售，但也不是没有。布雷兰因腐败而臭名昭著，一个NPC神职人员可能会要求以金币换取神秘援助。奥瑞恩的神职人员通常要求为他们的洞察力提供 \"捐赠\"。而在信仰特别强烈或普遍的地方，可以发现神职人员提供通常由魔法师执行的服务。在卡尔纳斯的一个探索者社区，你可能会发现当地的牧师在耕地时给骷髅赋予了生命。虔诚的铁匠可以通过呼唤奥纳塔而不是向坎尼斯学习来施展（%0%），但与奥术魔法不同的是，这个虔诚的铁匠不能将法术传授给学徒。神圣的法术是一种天赋，而不是一份工作；学徒可能会通过自己的虔诚赢得这种天赋，但这绝不是一件肯定的事。",
	"Within the Five Nations, Thrane is the greatest example of divine magic being worked into everyday life. Even there, Jorasco still provides healing and people rely on Sivis speaking stones to communicate. But in Flamekeep the streets are lit with silvery {@item everbright lantern|ERLW|everbright lanterns} created by adepts instead of artificers, and many other common services are provided by divine faith instead of arcane science. Beyond the Five Nations, the cultures of Aerenal and the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes use divine magic nearly as commonly as arcane services.": "在五国中，瑟兰是神圣的魔法被运用到日常生活中的最大例子。即使在那里，乔拉斯科仍然提供治疗，人们依靠西维斯说话的石头来交流。但在Flamekeep，街道上的灯光是由神职人员而不是工匠创造的银色（%0%），许多其他普通服务是由神圣的信仰而不是奥术科学提供的。在五国之外，阿伦纳的文化和恶魔荒原的加什卡拉兽人几乎和奥术服务一样普遍使用神术。",
	"Divine magic is real. For a player character, it's reliable, and under fifth edition rules, clerics and paladins don't risk losing their powers if their actions aren't perfectly aligned with their faith. As discussed in the \"What is Divine Magic\" section above, there are many ways to reflect the importance of faith and what makes playing a divine spellcaster feel distinctly different than playing a wizard.": "神圣的魔法是真实的。对于玩家角色来说，它是可靠的，而且根据第五版规则，如果牧师和圣骑士的行为与他们的信仰不完全一致，他们不会有失去力量的风险。正如上文 \"什么是神术 \"一节所讨论的，有许多方法可以反映出信仰的重要性，以及使扮演神术师与扮演巫师的感觉截然不同。",
	"But what happens when that faith falters? A DM and player could work together to reflect the evolution or even loss of faith by an equally dramatic mechanical change to a character. Consider a paladin who discovers or does something that deeply undermines their faith. If the character simply loses their class features, no one will have fun. But you could redesign the character as a fighter of the same level, reflecting the idea that their divine abilities are gone, but they're still a tough, hardbitten warrior. Or in reverse, you could start a campaign playing a fighter as a former paladin who lost your way; if you find redemption or new faith over the course of the campaign, you could eventually redesign the character to be a full paladin.": "但是，当这种信仰发生动摇时，会发生什么？管理员和玩家可以一起工作，通过对角色进行同样戏剧性的机械改变来反映信仰的演变或甚至丧失。考虑到一个圣骑士发现或做了一些严重破坏其信仰的事情。如果这个角色只是失去了他们的等级特征，那么没有人会觉得有趣。但你可以把这个角色重新设计为同一级别的战士，反映出他们的神力消失了，但他们仍然是一个强硬的、坚韧的战士。或者反过来说，你可以在战役开始时把一个战士扮演成一个迷失方向的前圣骑士；如果你在战役过程中找到救赎或新的信仰，你可以最终把这个角色重新设计成一个完整的圣骑士。",
	"Similarly, a character's beliefs might evolve rather than be lost entirely. Tira Miron began as a paladin of Dol Arrah but later embraced the Silver Flame. It's equally possible for a cleric of the Sovereign Host to have a journey that leads them to embrace the Blood of Vol; this sort of character evolution can be a remarkable story, and be reflected mechanically by the DM and player working together to swap their class archetype.": "同样地，一个角色的信仰可能会演变，而不是完全丧失。提拉-米隆一开始是多尔-阿拉的圣骑士，但后来拥抱了银色火焰。同样地，圣主教会的牧师也有可能经历一个导致他们接受沃尔之血的旅程；这种角色的演变可以是一个了不起的故事，并通过DM和玩家一起工作以交换他们的类别原型而在机械上得到反映。",
	"These mechanical changes might require some suspension of disbelief, as the paladin who becomes a fighter might suddenly be a significantly better fighter, and the cleric who swaps domains might lose proficiencies and have to throw away their armor. This is an imperfect process, and it's up to both player and DM to find ways to push past this and explain them within the story: {@i \"My armor was a prison. Now that I've embraced the light, I can't bear to carry the weight of war on my shoulders.\"} It's important to maintain game balance, even if it means overlooking a few blips in the story. But changing beliefs can be a good reason for a dramatic mechanical shift within a character. Ultimately, your beliefs—or lack thereof—don't have to be limited by a class choice you made at 1st level. Whether it's ultimately strengthened or abandoned, questioning and exploring faith can be an interesting path for any character.": "这些机械性的变化可能需要一些怀疑，因为变成战士的圣骑士可能会突然变成一个明显更好的战士，而换了领域的牧师可能会失去熟练度，不得不扔掉他们的盔甲。这是一个不完美的过程，要靠玩家和管理员找到方法来克服这个问题，并在故事中加以解释：（%0%）保持游戏平衡很重要，即使这意味着忽略故事中的一些小插曲。但是信仰的改变可以成为角色内部发生戏剧性机械变化的一个很好的理由。最终，你的信仰--或缺乏信仰--不必受你在第一级时所作的等级选择的限制。无论最终是加强还是放弃，对信仰的质疑和探索对任何角色来说都是一条有趣的道路。",
	"Eberron is just one bad day away from collapsing into a demonic apocalypse. The fiendish overlords struggle against their bonds, and shapeshifting rakshasa are manipulating humanity and working to release their masters. If you live in Khorvaire, you know as absolute fact that the dead can rise to prey on the living. You know that horrific aberrations could burst out of the underworld at any time and that the bite of a werewolf is all it would take to turn you into a murderous monster. The more you know, the worse it gets—even your dreams could be orchestrated by the Dreaming Dark. These things aren't questions of faith; these are simple facts. The overlords embody our worst fears. They thrive on hatred, cruelty, and chaos. Even when they're bound, they can use their influence to drive people toward darkness. And if they break their bonds, the world as you know it will be destroyed.": "Eberron只差一天就会崩溃成一个恶魔的启示。邪恶的霸主们在与他们的束缚作斗争，而变形罗刹正在操纵人类，努力释放他们的主人。如果你生活在霍尔韦尔，你就会知道一个绝对的事实，即死人可以复活来捕食活人。你知道可怕的反常现象随时可能从地下世界爆发出来，而且只要被狼人咬一口就能把你变成一个杀人的怪物。你知道得越多，情况就越糟糕--甚至你的梦都可能是由做梦的黑暗组织策划的。这些事情不是信仰的问题；这些是简单的事实。霸主们体现了我们最糟糕的恐惧。他们以仇恨、残忍和混乱为生。即使在他们被束缚的时候，他们也能利用他们的影响力将人们推向黑暗。如果他们打破束缚，你所知道的世界将被摧毁。",
	"These realities—and the need to protect the world from them—form the vital foundation of the Church of the Silver Flame. This is a world where deadly supernatural evil is a concrete fact of existence, and the church itself was founded when a noble paladin gave her life to pull her nation back from the abyss. Some might mistakenly see the church merely as a militant hierarchical religious organization and assume that it must be a force of oppression. But while the Church of the Silver Flame is a religion, it's equally a volunteer militia whose members are prepared to risk their lives to protect every innocent from the real and deadly threats lurking in the shadows. At the end of the day, the templar isn't there to tell you how you should live your life; they're there to make sure you can live your life, to protect you from the monsters and fiends that could appear at any moment.": "这些现实以及保护世界免受其害的需要构成了银焰教会的重要基础。在这个世界上，致命的超自然邪恶是一个具体存在的事实，而教会本身就是在一位高贵的圣骑士为把她的国家从深渊中拉回来而献出生命时建立的。有些人可能会误认为教会只是一个好战的等级制宗教组织，并认为它一定是一种压迫的力量。但是，虽然银焰教会是一种宗教，但它同样是一支志愿民兵，其成员准备冒着生命危险，保护每一个无辜者免受潜伏在阴影中的真实和致命的威胁。说到底，圣殿骑士不是来告诉你应该如何生活的；他们是来确保你能过上自己的生活，保护你免受随时可能出现的怪物和魔鬼的伤害。",
	"The Silver Flame was forged in the Age of Demons, and heroes of many cultures have wielded its power over the ages. The following principles form the common foundation of the Flame, regardless of whether you're a Ghaash'kala orc or a templar of Thrane—though extremist sects pick and choose which tenets to follow or discard. When dealing with followers of the Silver Flame, keep these in mind.": "银色火焰是在恶魔时代铸造的，许多文化中的英雄在过去的岁月中挥洒过它的力量。以下原则构成了银色火焰的共同基础，无论你是加什卡拉兽人还是瑟兰圣殿骑士--尽管极端教派会选择遵循或摒弃哪些信条。在与银色火焰的追随者打交道时，请牢记这些。",
	"The Silver Flame is a force created during the Age of Demons to bind the overlords. It has a concrete purpose: it is the cage that keeps apocalyptic evil at bay. The Sovereigns and Six are deities, believed to influence every facet of daily life. The Silver Flame is different. It's not seen as an anthropomorphic entity; rather, followers recognize it as a pure force of celestial energy. It doesn't influence the world on its own, and can only empower champions who will use that gift to protect the innocent. The Flame itself doesn't speak to people; instead, it is the Voice of the Flame that guides the faithful. Ultimately, the Silver Flame is a resource; if you seek to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, you may be able to draw on the power of the Flame to aid you in your fight.": "银色火焰是在恶魔时代创造的一种力量，用来束缚霸主。它有一个具体的目的：它是让世界末日的邪恶不受影响的牢笼。主权者和六人组是神灵，被认为影响着日常生活的每一个方面。银色火焰则不同。它不被看作是一个拟人化的实体；相反，信徒们承认它是一种纯粹的天体能量。它本身并不影响世界，只能赋予那些将使用这种天赋保护无辜者的冠军以力量。银色火焰本身并不与人交谈；相反，是银色火焰的声音在引导信徒。归根结底，银色火焰是一种资源；如果你想保护无辜者免受超自然的邪恶之害，你也许可以借助火焰的力量来帮助你战斗。",
	"The Silver Flame won't grant you a good harvest as Arawai will, nor will it send storms like the Devourer. The Silver Flame isn't a god, but a resource to serve a specific purpose, and there is no inherent conflict between the beliefs of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host. The Church of the Silver Flame is a practical, pragmatic faith founded on active public service. It takes the approach that the world will manage itself—that there will be a harvest or a storm whether or not you acknowledge Arawai or the Devourer—and that the most important thing is to protect people from the darkness that could destroy them. The church doesn't inherently challenge the worship of the Sovereigns, and the two faiths have coexisted peacefully throughout history. Paladins of Dol Arrah often coordinate with templars of the Silver Flame to deal with threats, and Vassals of the Sovereign Host are usually happy to accept the assistance of templars when danger strikes.": "银色火焰不会像阿拉威那样赐予你丰收，也不会像吞噬者那样发出风暴。银色火焰不是神，而是一种为特定目的服务的资源，银色火焰的信仰与主宰者的信仰之间没有内在的冲突。银色火焰教会是一种建立在积极的公共服务基础上的实际、务实的信仰。它采取的方法是，世界会自我管理--无论你是否承认阿拉威或吞噬者，都会有收获或风暴，最重要的是保护人们免受可能毁灭他们的黑暗。教会本质上并不挑战对圣主的崇拜，两种信仰在历史上一直和平共处。多尔-阿拉的圣骑士经常与银色火焰的圣殿骑士协调，以应对威胁，而当危险来临时，圣主的附庸通常乐意接受圣殿骑士的援助。",
	"The Silver Flame protects the entire world from the evil of the overlords, and likewise, those who channel its power should protect all innocents from supernatural threats. While extremist sects may stray from this path, the core beliefs of the Church of the Silver Flame don't elevate any nation or species above another. Templars of the Silver Flame should protect everyone from evil. Friars should guide and care for all who are in need.": "银色火焰保护整个世界免受霸主的邪恶之害，同样，那些引导银色火焰力量的人应该保护所有无辜者免受超自然的威胁。虽然极端教派可能会偏离这条道路，但银色火焰教会的核心信仰并没有将任何国家或物种提升到另一个国家或物种之上。银色火焰的圣殿骑士应该保护每个人免遭邪恶。修士们应该指导和照顾所有需要帮助的人。",
	"This principle was clearly evident during the Last War. Even when the Church took power in Thrane, most priests and templars in other nations continued to serve their people. Regardless of the position of the cardinals and the Keeper, the mission of the Flame is to defend the innocent, not to rule the world. Brelish and Cyran templars would quickly unite with Thranes if a supernatural threat arose in the midst of a conflict; if demons from Shavarath appeared on a battlefield, all templars would unite against them. But in the absence of supernatural evil, there's nothing preventing a templar from serving their nation or protecting their family. While the templars of Thrane are also the army of Thrane, they still recognize the difference between their sacred duty and their service to their nation.": "这一原则在最后的战争中得到了明显的体现。即使教会在瑟兰掌权，其他国家的大多数牧师和圣殿骑士也继续为他们的人民服务。无论红衣主教和守护者的立场如何，圣火的使命是捍卫无辜者，而不是统治世界。如果在冲突中出现了超自然的威胁，布雷利什和锡兰的圣殿骑士会迅速与瑟兰斯联合起来；如果来自沙瓦拉斯的恶魔出现在战场上，所有圣殿骑士会联合起来对付他们。但在没有超自然的邪恶的情况下，没有什么能阻止圣殿骑士为他们的国家服务或保护他们的家庭。虽然瑟兰的圣殿骑士也是瑟兰的军队，但他们仍然认识到他们的神圣职责和为国家服务之间的区别。",
	"The Silver Flame was kindled to bind the fiendish overlords, immortal spirits that cannot be destroyed. The overlords are the embodiments of hatred, fear, greed, cruelty—and, like the overlords themselves, these things can never be permanently destroyed, only held at bay. The message of the Silver Flame isn't that evil can ever be permanently eradicated. It is that we must be ever vigilant and prepared to deal with evil when it arises. Even in the most peaceful moments, a new terror could emerge from Khyber, or a gate could spill shadows out of Mabar. And even in a town of virtuous people, someone could be corrupted by greed or anger. The templar stands ever ready to fight the physical threat, while the minister seeks to keep their people on the virtuous path.": "银色火焰的点燃是为了束缚邪恶的霸主，这些不朽的精神是无法被摧毁的。霸主是仇恨、恐惧、贪婪、残忍的化身--就像霸主本身一样，这些东西永远无法被永久地摧毁，只能被遏制。银色火焰的信息并不是说邪恶可以被永久地消除。而是我们必须时刻保持警惕，准备在邪恶出现时加以应对。即使在最和平的时刻，新的恐怖也可能从开伯尔出现，或者一个门可能从马巴尔溢出阴影。即使是在一个充满美德的城镇，也可能有人被贪婪或愤怒所腐蚀。圣殿骑士随时准备与身体上的威胁作斗争，而部长则试图让他们的人民保持在美德的道路上。",
	"The basic doctrine of the Silver Flame doesn't promise punishment or paradise after death. But its faithful commonly believe that the souls of those who live virtuous lives pass through Dolurrh unharmed, merging with the Silver Flame itself. By strengthening the Flame, these souls continue to protect the innocent of generations to come. Merging with the Flame is generally depicted as a transcendent union with those who have gone before, a state beyond mortal understanding—seen both as a reward and a duty.": "银色火焰的基本教义并不承诺死后的惩罚或天堂。但它的信徒们普遍相信，那些过着美德生活的人的灵魂会毫发无损地通过多勒尔，与银色火焰本身融合。通过加强银色火焰，这些灵魂继续保护后代的无辜者。与银色火焰的融合通常被描述为与前人的超然结合，一种超越凡人理解的状态，既被视为一种奖励，也被视为一种责任。",
	"Typically, souls that merge with the Flame don't return to the mortal world. However, it is possible for a spirit within the Flame to maintain its identity, guiding or advising the faithful from beyond. The Church of the Silver Flame calls out Tira Miron as the Voice of the Flame, who stands between eternity and mortality and guides the faithful toward the light. However, the Ghaash'kala and the serpent cults existed long before the sacrifice of Tira Miron, and they have their own Voices of the Flame—heroes who guide the faithful of these cultures.": "通常情况下，与火焰融合的灵魂不会返回凡人世界。然而，火焰中的灵魂有可能保持其身份，从外面指导或建议信徒。银色火焰教会称提拉-米隆为火焰之声，他站在永恒和凡间之间，引导信徒走向光明。然而，在提拉-米隆牺牲之前，加什卡拉和大蛇教已经存在了很长时间，他们有自己的火焰之声--引导这些文化的信徒的英雄。",
	"The Silver Flame empowers mortals to fight against evil. But not all evils are equal, and different threats call for different approaches. The Church of the Silver Flame defines the hierarchy of evil as follows:": "银色火焰赋予了凡人对抗邪恶的力量。但并非所有的邪恶都是平等的，不同的威胁需要不同的方法。银色火焰教会对邪恶的等级定义如下。",
	"These are the children of Khyber, encompassing all manner of fiends and aberrations. These beings are fundamentally unnatural and innately malevolent; even their presence is seen as harmful to the world.": "这些人是开伯尔的孩子，包括各种形式的恶魔和畸形人。这些人从根本上说是不自然的，而且天生恶毒；甚至他们的存在也被视为对世界有害。",
	"These are beings once native to Eberron that have been corrupted by alien forces. Undead and lycanthropes are the most obvious examples of this category—innocent people transformed into monsters. Like the followers of the Undying Court, the Church of the Silver Flame maintains that undead are inherently unnatural and harm the living simply through their existence.": "这些人曾经是Eberron的本地人，但却被外来的力量所腐蚀。亡灵和狼人是这一类最明显的例子--无辜的人变成了怪物。与不死阁的追随者一样，银焰教会认为不死族本质上是不自然的，仅仅因为他们的存在就伤害了活人。",
	"This is the most contentious category on the list, and it is the idea of {@i monsters}—that there are creatures native to Eberron who are evil by nature. In the past, the church has placed medusas, harpies, trolls, and similar creatures into this category, asserting that through no fault of their own, these creatures are vessels for supernatural evil and pose a threat to the innocent.": "这是名单上最有争议的类别，它是{@i monsters}的想法--认为Eberron原生的生物本质上是邪恶的。在过去，教会将梅杜莎、女妖、巨魔和类似的生物归入这一类别，断言这些生物不是因为自己的过错，而是超自然的邪恶的容器，对无辜者构成威胁。",
	"This encompasses all humanoids who are born innocent but choose to follow an evil path. Because such beings aren't evil by nature, the goal of the faithful should always be to lead them back to the light.": "这包括所有生来无罪但选择走邪恶道路的人类。因为这样的生命本质上并不邪恶，所以信徒的目标应该始终是引导他们回归光明。",
	"Every follower of the Flame must recognize their own capacity for evil action; only through awareness can they guard against it. The Shadow in the Flame is always whispering, and it is arrogant and foolish to ignore that threat.": "每个火焰的追随者都必须认识到自己的邪恶行为能力；只有通过认识才能防范它。火焰中的阴影总是在低语，无视这种威胁是傲慢和愚蠢的。",
	"Entities of alien and unnatural evil must be fought with steel and spell. This is the purpose of the Silver Flame: to protect the innocent against these threats. When such forces arise, followers of the Silver Flame are expected to set aside any differences until the evil is defeated; this was seen in the Last War, where templars might serve different nations but would unite to deal with a supernatural threat. If it's possible to eradicate a threat without violence—such as curing a lycanthrope rather than killing it—that's acceptable, even laudable. But protection of the innocent should always be the primary concern, which is why the Silver Crusade focused on the eradication of the lycanthropes; the templars rarely had the resources to capture and cure lycanthropes.": "外来的和非自然的邪恶实体必须用钢铁和法术来对抗。这就是银色火焰的目的：保护无辜者免受这些威胁。当这种力量出现时，银色火焰的追随者被期望搁置任何分歧，直到邪恶被击败；这在最后的战争中可以看到，圣殿骑士可能服务于不同的国家，但会联合起来应对超自然的威胁。如果有可能在不使用暴力的情况下消除威胁--比如治疗狼人而不是杀死它--那是可以接受的，甚至是值得称赞的。但保护无辜者应该永远是首要考虑的问题，这就是为什么银色十字军的重点是消灭狼人；圣殿骑士团很少有资源来捕获和治疗狼人。",
	"The Silver Flame is tied to Eberron. If you worship the Flame and cast a spell that normally contacts or summons an extraplanar ally, you touch the power of the Flame itself. This could be a couatl, or you could speak to the Voice of the Silver Flame—the spirit of Tira Miron, though now that she is bound to the Silver Flame, she is far more than just a ghost. {@spell Conjure celestial} will usually summon a couatl, its essence drawn from the Silver Flame and given temporary existence until its task is done. {@spell Planar ally} can produce more powerful celestials, but these aren't called from another plane; while they may use the statistics of angels, they are formed from the pure light of the Flame itself and return to the Flame when their work is done.": "银色火焰与Eberron息息相关。如果你崇拜银焰，并施展一个通常会接触或召唤星外盟友的法术，你就会触及银焰本身的力量。这可能是一个库拉特尔，或者你可以与银色火焰的声音--提拉-米隆的灵魂对话，尽管现在她已经被银色火焰束缚住了，她远不止是一个幽灵。{@spell Conjure celestial}通常会召唤一个库拉特，它的精华来自银色火焰，在完成任务之前，它被赋予暂时的存在。(1%)可以产生更强大的天人，但这些天人不是从另一个位面召唤来的；虽然他们可能使用天使的统计数据，但他们是由火焰本身的纯光形成的，当他们的工作完成后，就会回到火焰中。",
	"With those who choose evil and those who fall prey to the evil within, the Church of the Silver Flame urges compassion over brutality. Templars take arms against unnatural evil, but it is the purpose of friars and ministers to guide mortals to the light. Innocents must always be protected from those who would harm them, but anyone who chooses evil could be convinced to choose good, and true followers of the Flame are encouraged to act with empathy and compassion for all natural creatures.": "对于那些选择邪恶的人和那些成为邪恶的牺牲品的人，银焰教会敦促人们以同情心对待残暴。圣殿骑士拿起武器反对非自然的邪恶，但修士和牧师的目的是引导凡人走向光明。必须始终保护无辜者不受伤害，但任何选择邪恶的人都可以被说服选择善良，银色火焰的真正追随者被鼓励以同情和怜悯之心对待所有自然生物。",
	"In the past, the church assumed that trolls, harpies, worgs, and similar creatures were innately evil, so templars eliminated these threats wherever they were encountered. With the rise of Droaam and House Tharashk's introduction of monstrous mercenaries, Khorvaire is learning that these creatures aren't any more inherently evil than humans or dwarves. Ultimately, it is up to the Keeper of the Flame to make rulings on these matters—much like a past Keeper's ruling that the deathless of Aerenal are not creatures of unnatural evil. In 992 YK, Keeper Lavira Tagor ruled that the church needed to reevaluate the classification of innate evil, and that templars should judge the actions of creatures in question and seek guidance from the Voice of the Flame. Since then, the Council of Cardinals has been debating the status of Droaam, but Keeper Daran has yet to make a final ruling on the matter.": "在过去，教会认为巨魔、哈皮斯、虫子和类似的生物是天生邪恶的，所以圣殿骑士在遇到这些威胁时都会将其消灭。随着德罗阿姆的崛起和塔拉什克家族对畸形雇佣兵的引进，霍尔韦尔正在学习这些生物并不比人类或矮人更本质上邪恶。最终，要由火焰守护者对这些问题做出裁决--就像过去的守护者裁决Aerenal的无死亡者不是非自然的邪恶生物一样。在992年，守护者拉维拉-塔戈尔裁定，教会需要重新评估先天邪恶的分类，圣殿骑士应该判断有问题的生物的行为，并寻求火焰之声的指导。从那时起，红衣主教会议一直在辩论德罗阿姆的地位，但守护者达兰还没有对此事做出最终裁决。",
	"The Ghaash'kala, serpent cults, and other paths have their own traditions, each with the same core principle—the Silver Flame is a tool that allows the virtuous to fight fiends and unnatural horrors. Though those paths may share similar beliefs, this particular hierarchy of evil is specifically defined by the Keeper and the doctrine of the Church of Thrane.": "加什卡拉（Ghaash'kala）、大蛇教和其他道路都有自己的传统，每一个都有相同的核心原则--银色火焰是一种工具，可以让有德行的人与恶魔和非自然的恐怖作斗争。虽然这些道路可能有类似的信仰，但这种特殊的邪恶等级制度是由守护者和瑟兰教会的教义特别定义的。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame represents just one path of the faith. It was built on the teachings of Tira Miron, but less than a year elapsed between her vision—leading her to embrace the Flame and rally an army—and her final sacrifice to defeat Bel Shalor. Thus, it wasn't her own words that established most of the church's traditions and doctrines, but the words of those who fought alongside her during that year. These were refined over time by priests who'd never met her—despite the passage of time, it's believed these priests were guided by the Voice in the Flame.": "银色火焰教会只是代表了信仰的一条道路。它建立在提拉-米隆的教义之上，但从她的愿景--导致她拥抱火焰并召集军队--到她为击败贝尔-沙洛而做出最后的牺牲，中间只隔了不到一年的时间。因此，确立教会大部分传统和教义的并不是她自己的言论，而是那些在那一年与她并肩作战的人的言论。随着时间的推移，这些话被那些从未见过她的祭司们提炼出来--尽管时间流逝，但人们相信这些祭司是由火焰中的声音引导的。",
	"The Keeper of the Flame is tied specifically to the official Church of the Silver Flame. The Keeper's power is based in Flamekeep, and the fountain of fire they keep marks the spot where Tira Miron gave her life to restore the bonds of the overlord Bel Shalor.

While it's a focal point where the Silver Flame's power bleeds into the world and a conduit for those who seek the guidance of the Voice of the Flame, the Silver Flame itself is far more than a spark in one cathedral—its power stretches across Eberron, binding overlords on every continent. The Church of the Silver Flame celebrates the Keeper of the Flame as being both the vessel of the Voice and the channel for the power of the Flame. However, the faithful of other cultures—such as the Ghaash'kala of the Demon Wastes—see the Keeper as a powerful priest and nothing more.": "火焰守护者与官方的银色火焰教会有特殊的联系。守护者的力量基于火焰之城，他们保存的火之泉标志着提拉-米隆为恢复霸主贝尔-沙洛的束缚而献出生命的地方。有些人错误地认为这个火泉（%0%）就是银色火焰。虽然它是银色火焰的力量渗入世界的焦点，也是那些寻求火焰之声指引的人的通道，但银色火焰本身远不止是一个大教堂里的火花--它的力量延伸到整个艾伯伦，束缚着每个大陆上的霸主。银色火焰教会颂扬火焰守护者，认为他既是声音的容器，又是火焰力量的通道。然而，其他文化的信徒--比如恶魔荒原的加什卡拉--将守护者视为一个强大的牧师，仅此而已。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame is largely willing to overlook the divergent beliefs of groups like the Ghaash'kala. In the church's eyes, these northern orcs are a curiosity and their unusual beliefs don't threaten the faithful of the Five Nations. Likewise, the Council of Cardinals has taken no action to suppress the extreme beliefs of the Pure Flame, even going so far as appointing the puritan Archbishop Dariznu as governor of Thaliost. In part, this is because the Pure Flame came into its own over the course of the Last War, and the cardinals of Thrane had little ability to enforce their will over the faithful of Aundair. Dariznu's appointment was an effort to ensure that the followers of the Pure Flame would accept the authority of Flamekeep. Despite the church thus far taking no action against the Pure Flame, Keeper Daran is deeply troubled by this sect and is considering the best way to address the problem.": "银焰教会在很大程度上愿意忽略像加什卡拉这样的团体的不同信仰。在教会眼中，这些北方兽人是一种好奇心，他们不寻常的信仰不会威胁到五国的信众。同样，红衣主教会议也没有采取任何行动来压制纯洁之火的极端信仰，甚至不惜任命清教徒大主教达里兹努为塔利奥斯特的长官。在某种程度上，这是因为 \"纯洁之火 \"在最后一次战争的过程中形成了自己的势力，而瑟兰的红衣主教们几乎没有能力对昂代尔的信徒们强制执行他们的意志。达里兹努的任命是为了确保纯洁之火的信徒接受火焰镇的权威。尽管教会至今没有对纯洁之火采取任何行动，但达兰守护者对这个教派深感不安，正在考虑解决这个问题的最佳方法。",
	"There have been times when heretical beliefs divided the church, the most infamous known as the Time of Two Keepers. In 497 YK, a peasant woman calling herself Melysse Miron challenged Keeper Kyra Danth for control of Flamekeep and the Church of the Silver Flame. Melysse claimed that Tira Miron had revealed she was Tira's direct descendant and the rightful Keeper. She challenged many church doctrines and claimed it had strayed from its path. And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame—it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn't killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.": "曾有过异端信仰分裂教会的时候，最臭名昭著的是 \"两个守护者的时代\"。公元497年，一个自称米利塞-米隆的农妇向守护者凯拉-丹斯挑战，争夺对火焰镇和银焰教会的控制权。梅利塞声称，提拉-米隆已经透露她是提拉的直系后裔，是合法的守护者。她挑战了许多教会的教义，并声称教会已经偏离了它的道路。和守护者丹斯一样，梅利塞也令人震惊地能够在火焰镇挥舞火泉的力量，创造出其他牧师无法比拟的奇迹。这引发了一场持续多年的深刻分裂，直到梅莉斯最终被揭露是火焰中的阴影所选中的手--不是银色火焰，而是霸主贝尔-沙洛，在火焰镇强化了她。由于担心她的死亡会让贝尔-沙洛选择新的反守卫者，梅莉斯没有被杀死；相反，她被石化并被安置在Dreadhold，直到今天她还在那里。",
	"More recently, the church was divided in 914 YK when Keeper Serrain was invested with temporal authority over the nation of Thrane. While many celebrated the idea of a kingdom founded on the noble principles of the church, there are many—even some in Thrane itself—who believe that investing cardinals and Keeper with political power distracts the church from its proper mission and serves as an invitation to corruption. This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn't rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain. In the wake of this division, Stormreach was formally severed from Flamekeep; it receives no support and Flamekeep doesn't acknowledge its priests within the church hierarchy. As such, Stormreach has become a haven for those who believe in the principles of the Flame but question its doctrine.": "最近，教会在914 YK时出现了分歧，当时守护者Serrain被赋予了对Thrane国家的临时权力。虽然许多人庆祝一个建立在教会崇高原则基础上的王国的想法，但也有许多人--甚至是瑟兰本身的一些人--认为赋予红衣主教和守护者以政治权力会使教会偏离其应有的使命，并成为腐败的诱因。这成为在最后一次战争中与瑟兰作战的外国圣殿骑士的理由；他们争辩说，他们继续尊重守护者的精神权威，但教会不应该统治一个重新统一的加利法尔。暴风城的牧师们甚至谴责神权和守护者瑟兰。在这次分裂之后，Stormreach正式与Flamekeep断绝关系；它没有得到任何支持，Flamekeep也不承认它的牧师在教会的等级制度中。因此，Stormreach已经成为那些相信火焰的原则但质疑其教义的人的天堂。",

According to the stories, Tira Miron foresaw the danger of the Shadow in the Flame. On the eve of her battle with Bel Shalor, Tira charged her trusted companion Samyr Kes to monitor the Church that was to come for signs of fiendish corruption—to save those who could be saved, and eliminate those who could not. Those who believe these tales say that it was agents of Miron's Tears who recognized the threat of Melysse Miron and exposed her as an agent of Bel Shalor.": "大多数人认为米隆之泪是一个城市传奇--一个深入银色火焰教会的间谍和刺客的秘密组织，甚至对守护者和红衣主教都是隐藏的。根据这些故事，提拉-米隆预见到了火焰中的阴影的危险。在她与贝尔-沙洛之战的前夕，蒂拉责成她信任的同伴萨米尔-凯斯监视即将到来的教会，寻找恶魔般的腐败迹象--拯救那些可以被拯救的人，消灭那些无法被拯救的人。那些相信这些传说的人说，是米隆之泪的代理人认识到了梅利塞-米隆的威胁，并揭露了她是贝尔-沙洛的代理人。",
	"It's up to the DM to decide if this order exists or if it died out long ago.

Virtuous player characters could be recruited into the order. Or chaos could ensue when an ally of the player characters—secretly a servant of the Lords of Dust—is targeted by the Tears.": "这要由DM来决定这个教团是否存在，或者它是否早已消亡。如果他还活着，萨米尔-凯斯--一个被火焰延长了长寿的精灵，可能会对现代教会的腐败感到厌恶。除了打击恶魔般的腐败，米隆的眼泪还可以针对布雷兰的贪婪牧师，打击昂代尔的纯洁火焰的极端主义，甚至寻求推翻瑟兰的神权，将其视为对教会的腐败影响。有德行的玩家角色可以被招募到这个组织中。或者，当玩家角色的盟友--秘密的尘土领主的仆人--被眼泪组织盯上时，混乱就会随之而来。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame has lofty aspirations, and it's easy to find fault when it fails to live up to them. While there's always potential for corruption in the church, it's often exaggerated.

Usually this reflects a fundamental lack of faith, and as a result, opportunists rarely wield divine magic. If an opportunist can channel the power of the Flame, it suggests that somehow, they are able to justify these conflicting concepts—that they truly believe their actions are righteous and serve the greater good, even if those actions incidentally line the pockets of the priest. Such a character might believe that they need greater wealth or influence to help others, or that they are fighting fire with fire—teaching the wicked the error of their ways through political or economic means.

This still requires deep faith, but the Tarnished are devoted to quite different principles. The most widespread form of this corruption is the cult of the Whispering Flame, described in the section on \"The Cults of the Dragon Below.\" But the Tarnished can also be loners who embrace the evil within alone.

Not everyone can live up to these ideals, and the Last War was an inherently violent time. But the faith still urges everyone to resist the evil within, and instead to embrace the virtues of generosity and compassion.": "一些基本信条指导着忠实的群众。作为一个农民，你可能没有力量与外来的邪恶作斗争，但你总是可以防范内心的邪恶，帮助你周围的人选择光明而不是黑暗。教会教义敦促信徒们以同情心和怜悯之心行事，设法理解你周围人的烦恼，减轻他们的负担，抵制以怒制怒，只有在万不得已时才求助于暴力。不是每个人都能达到这些理想，而最后的战争是一个固有的暴力时代。但信仰仍然敦促每个人抵制内心的邪恶，而是拥抱慷慨和同情的美德。",

	"This is the message of the Blood of Vol. Life is suffering and death is annihilation, but you can defy this cruel fate—and perhaps even break the cycle for good.": "这就是《沃尔之血》的信息。 生命是苦难，死亡是毁灭，但你可以藐视这种残酷的命运--甚至可能永远地打破这个循环。",
	"Most followers of the Blood of Vol identify as Seekers of the Divinity Within—usually shortened to Seekers—though there are other traditions within the faith. The Blood of Vol has long been vilified, with outsiders often viewing it as a death cult, falsely equating it with the cult of Katashka the Gatekeeper (described later in this chapter), or blaming its members for plagues and blights. In the midst of misinformation and fear, what is the truth of the Blood of Vol?": "大多数沃尔之血的追随者都认同 \"内在神性的探索者\"--通常简称为 \"探索者\"--尽管在这个信仰中还有其他传统。沃尔之血长期以来一直受到诋毁，外人往往将其视为死亡邪教，错误地将其与守门人卡塔什卡的邪教（本章后面会介绍）等同起来，或者将瘟疫和疾病归咎于其成员。在错误信息和恐惧中，沃尔之血的真相是什么？",
	"Human settlers to Khorvaire brought the faith of the Sovereign Host with them, but the Blood of Vol is indigenous to the continent. The line of Vol was a noble line of Aerenal, as described in chapter 2, with a long tradition of necromancy tracing its roots back to Xen'drik. When members of the line of Vol developed the dragonmark known as the Mark of Death, they undertook a risky series of experiments designed to unlock its full powers. This ended when the Undying Court and the dragons of Argonnessen joined forces to eradicate the bloodlines that carried the Mark of Death. In the aftermath of this brutal purge, those elves who had supported Vol but didn't bear its blood were given the choice of exile or swearing fealty to the Sibling Kings of Aerenal. This resulted in a wave of exiled elves settling in the Lhazaar Principalities and spreading west into the lands that are now Karrnath.": "来到霍尔韦尔的人类移民带来了主宰者的信仰，但沃尔之血是这片大陆的原住民。如第二章所述，沃尔家族是艾瑞纳的一个贵族家族，拥有悠久的死灵法术传统，其根源可追溯至Xen'drik。当沃尔家族的成员开发出被称为 \"死亡印记 \"的龙纹时，他们进行了一系列危险的实验，旨在释放其全部力量。当不死阁和阿贡纳森的龙们联合起来消灭携带死亡印记的血统时，这一切就结束了。在这场残酷的清洗之后，那些曾经支持沃尔但没有携带其血统的精灵被赋予了流放或向艾瑞纳尔的兄弟姐妹国王宣誓效忠的选择。这导致了一波被流放的精灵在拉扎尔公国定居，并向西扩展到现在的卡尔纳特的土地。",
	"These exiles brought the knowledge of necromancy along with stories of how the heroic family of Vol had sought to attain godhood, only to be destroyed by the jealous gods. The people of the region knew nothing of Aereni traditions or dragonmarks, and they blended this story with their own experience of life in a harsh land, local tyrants, and the empty promises of Sovereign priests. And in the process, they somehow discovered something real. The line of Vol had never sought the divinity within, but these first priests found it, drawing divine power from their own conviction and their own souls.": "这些流亡者带来了亡灵巫术的知识，同时也带来了沃尔的英雄家族如何寻求成神的故事，但却被嫉妒的诸神所毁灭。该地区的人们对Aereni的传统和龙纹一无所知，他们将这个故事与自己在严酷的土地上的生活经历、当地的暴君以及主权祭司的空洞承诺相融合。而在这个过程中，他们不知不觉发现了一些真实的东西。沃尔家族从未寻求过内在的神性，但这些第一批祭司找到了它，从他们自己的信念和自己的灵魂中汲取神力。",
	"So despite its name, the religion was never practiced by the line of Vol, nor by the infamous Erandis Vol herself, who was in hiding during the period in which the faith evolved. It is a faith born of the blending of elf and human myths and traditions. While the faithful believe that \"Vol\" was the first person to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality, the faith is based around the divinity within each of us, not the worship of this mythical Vol. Even devoted priests of Vol do not know Erandis Vol's identity, though they respect the name of \"Vol\" as author of their core texts, believing that this Vol challenged the Sovereigns, then was subsequently destroyed by these jealous gods—a martyr of the faith. Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all. So if Erandis Vol were to proclaim her true identity, many of the faithful would be impressed by her lineage, but her bloodline alone wouldn't give her divine authority.": "因此，尽管它的名字叫 \"沃尔\"，但这个宗教从来没有被沃尔一族奉为圭臬，也没有被臭名昭著的埃兰迪斯-沃尔本人奉为圭臬，她在这个信仰发展的时期一直在躲藏。它是一种由精灵和人类的神话和传统混合而成的信仰。虽然信徒们相信 \"沃尔 \"是第一个发现内在神性并挑战死亡诅咒的人，但这个信仰的基础是我们每个人内在的神性，而不是对这个神话中的沃尔的崇拜。 即使是沃尔的忠实牧师也不知道埃兰迪斯-沃尔的身份，尽管他们尊重 \"沃尔 \"的名字，认为他是他们核心文本的作者，认为这个沃尔挑战了主权者，随后被这些嫉妒的神消灭了，他是这个信仰的殉道者。现代探索者学者对这个名字的起源进行了辩论，沃尔是一个人还是一群人，或者与精灵系根本就有关系。因此，如果埃兰迪斯-沃尔宣布她的真实身份，许多信徒会被她的血统所打动，但仅凭她的血统并不能赋予她神圣的权力。",
	"Millennia ago, as the faith of the Blood of Vol emerged in pre-Galifar Khorvaire, it stood in opposition to the dominant beliefs and authorities of the time. The tyrannical leaders asserted that the Sovereigns blessed their bloodlines and their rule. By challenging the benevolence of the Sovereigns, these early Seekers were also challenging the despots of the time. As time marched on and those petty tyrants fell, the Sovereign Host remained the dominant faith of humanity in Khorvaire, and the philosophical divide between Seeker and Vassal only grew.": "几千年前，当沃尔之血的信仰在前加里法尔-霍尔韦尔出现时，它与当时的主流信仰和权威相对立。暴虐的领袖们宣称，君主保佑他们的血统和他们的统治。通过挑战君主的仁慈，这些早期探索者也在挑战当时的专制者。随着时间的推移和那些小暴君的倒台，主宰者仍然是霍尔韦尔人类的主导信仰，而探索者和附庸之间的哲学分歧只会越来越大。",
	"The Seekers were also shunned for their use of necromancy, generally considered taboo and said to be condemned by Aureon and Dol Arrah. This prejudice grew worse with the rise of Galifar and the Church of the Silver Flame, which asserted that undead are inherently anathema and drain the life from the world by their very existence. In turn, this caused people to blame plagues and blights on the Seekers. However, the Blood of Vol is a faith grounded in the principle of an oppressive universe, and it endured in spite of this prejudice and persecution. But it never spread far beyond the harsh lands where it began, and Seekers are often still met with fear and suspicion today.": "探寻者们也因为使用死灵法术而被回避，这通常被认为是禁忌，据说是被奥瑞恩和多尔-阿拉赫谴责的。这种偏见随着加利法尔和银焰教会的兴起而变得更加严重，银焰教会认为亡灵本身就是一种诅咒，它们的存在会消耗世界的生命。反过来，这也导致人们将瘟疫和瘟疫归咎于探索者。然而，沃尔之血是一种建立在压迫性宇宙原则基础上的信仰，尽管有这种偏见和迫害，它还是经久不衰。但它从未在它开始的那片严酷的土地上传播得很远，而且探索者今天仍然经常遇到恐惧和怀疑。",
	"The universe is against us, and all we have is each other.": "宇宙对我们不利，而我们所拥有的只是彼此。",
	"This is one of the most basic principles of the Blood of Vol. Despite its grim outlook, it is a faith that emphasizes the value of friendship, family, and community. There are no benevolent gods looking out for us, so we have to look out for each other. Death is the end, so we can't let it steal the people we care about without a fight. And since there is no pleasant afterlife waiting for us, we should treasure the time we have with those we love. These values have kept the Blood of Vol alive through the centuries: the deep commitment to community and to working together even in the face of impossible odds.": "这是《沃尔之血》最基本的原则之一。 尽管它的前景很严峻，但它是一种强调友谊、家庭和社区价值的信仰。没有仁慈的神灵在照顾我们，所以我们必须互相照顾。死亡就是结束，所以我们不能让它不顾一切地偷走我们关心的人。既然没有愉快的来世在等着我们，我们应该珍惜与我们所爱的人在一起的时间。这些价值观使沃尔之血在几个世纪以来一直保持着活力：对社区的深刻承诺，以及即使在面对不可能的困难时也要一起工作。",
	"Divinity lies within our blood.": "神性存在于我们的血液中。",
	"In the eyes of the Seeker, life and the soul are both divine forces. Every soul has the potential to evolve and develop divine power—but this takes time and willpower, and most mortals die before they accomplish it.": "在探索者的眼中，生命和灵魂都是神圣的力量。每个灵魂都有进化和发展神圣力量的潜力--但这需要时间和意志力，大多数凡人在完成之前就已经死亡。",
	"As a divine spellcaster who follows the Blood of Vol, you believe that your power comes from your own soul. As a paladin, you are calling on the power of your own blood when you heal your allies or smite your enemies. The visible manifestations of magic of the Blood of Vol typically involve crimson energy, as if luminous tendrils of blood are flowing from you. But it's not simply your power. Consider the Seeker priest who casts {@spell commune}; how can they gain information they don't already know? The answer is that the divinity within is something far greater than you. It is a god, possessing celestial power you can't understand or imagine—but it is still in its chrysalis, waiting to be born. When you cast your spell, you awaken a sliver of its power; once the spell is done, it returns to its rest.": "作为一个遵循沃尔之血的神圣施法者，你相信你的力量来自你自己的灵魂。作为一名圣骑士，当你治疗你的盟友或打击你的敌人时，你是在召唤你自己血液的力量。沃尔之血的魔法的可见表现通常涉及深红色的能量，就像发光的血卷从你身上流淌出来。但这不仅仅是你的力量。考虑到施展（%0%）的探索者牧师；他们怎么能获得他们不知道的信息？答案是，内在的神性是远比你更伟大的东西。它是一个神，拥有你无法理解或想象的天体力量--但它仍在蛹中，等待诞生。当你施法时，你唤醒了它的一丝力量；一旦施法完成，它就会回到它的休息状态。",
	"Or at least, that's what a Seeker believes. Scholars of other faiths argue that the Seekers are deluded, that their powers are simply drawn from some other source, the same kind of delusion that allows a warforged cleric to draw magic from their devotion to the Lord of Blades. However, Seeker priests can reverse this same argument. What proof is there that all clerics aren't simply drawing on their own divine sparks—that even a paladin of Dol Arrah mistakenly thinks their power come from above, when really, it's always come from within?": "或者至少，探索者是这么认为的。其他信仰的学者认为探索者是被欺骗了，他们的力量只是来自于其他的来源，就像让战神教士从对刀锋之主的奉献中汲取魔法的那种错觉一样。然而，探索者牧师也可以反驳这种说法。有什么证据表明所有的牧师都不是简单地从他们自己的神圣火花中汲取力量--即使是多尔-阿拉的圣骑士也会错误地认为他们的力量来自于上面，而实际上，它总是来自于内心？",
	"The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what's left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community—why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.": "沃尔之血是在与艾瑞尼死灵法师的合作中出现的，而亡灵一直与信仰有关。首先，也是最重要的，这种联系是出于实用性。探索者对尸体没有敬畏之心；内在的神性与生命和灵魂息息相关，一旦这些东西消失，剩下的就只是肉和骨头。作为这一点的延伸，大多数探索者希望他们的尸体能够被利用。这种信仰是由服务社会的理念驱动的--当你的尸体可以帮助你的朋友和家人时，为什么要让它被浪费掉？因此，无意识的亡灵经常出现在探索者社区，充当守护者，从事体力劳动，并完成其他简单的任务。",
	"However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years—but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.": "然而，一个常见的误解是，探索者想成为不死之身。有些人确实如此，纯粹是被遗忘的恐惧所驱使，但不死是一种悲惨的半衰期，而不是一种胜利。内在的神性与你的血液和灵魂结合在一起，所以探索者认为不死人的灵魂被困在他们的尸体中，神性的火花在他们身上消失。那些拥抱不死之身的人被视为殉道者，通常被期望保护和服务他们的探索者群体。这些冠军中最公开的一个是阿图尔的大祭司--木乃伊领主Malevanor。阿图尔的前任大祭司是木乃伊阿斯卡洛，他担任这个职位超过四百年，但他对长期的不死之身感到厌倦。当马勒瓦诺在最后一次战争中严重受伤时，阿斯卡洛尔将他的权力和他的不死之身转移给了他的徒弟。这提出了一个有趣的问题：如果内心的神性在于血液，那么马勒瓦诺是如何施展神性魔法的？答案是，探索者群体以仪式方式抽取他们的血液并与这些冠军分享。吸血鬼喝这种血，而木乃伊或地衣则可能用它来洗澡。通过这种方式，亡灵祭司从活着的信徒的血液中汲取力量。",
	"Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones—so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them.": "沃尔之血与亡灵魔法之间的长期联系的另一个因素是，探索者社区经常在马巴尔的显灵区或附近形成。虽然这些地区往往是荒凉或危险的，但在许多世纪的过程中，探索者们已经学会了如何利用这些地方的能量。因为马巴兰的显化区通常是枯萎的，所以外人常常指责探索者造成枯萎。实际上，探索者们经常举行仪式，限制显化区的负面影响--因此，他们没有造成与马巴相关的瘟疫和疾病，而是经常防止它们。",
	"If the power of the Blood of Vol flows from within, who answers when a cleric conjures a celestial or invokes {@spell planar ally}? One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it's a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for {@spell planar ally}, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious—a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you've been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don't fully understand what it needs or wants.": "如果沃尔之血的力量从内部流淌出来，那么当牧师召唤出天人或召唤出（%0%）时，谁来回答？一个简单的答案是，DM可以使用一个具有天人或恶魔的统计资料的生命，但它是由血液和魔法形成的；它是你自己的神性本质的表现，当它的工作完成后就会消失。这对于{@spell planar ally}这个通常需要向外部力量付款的法术来说似乎是个奇怪的搭配，但即使是你自己本质的盟友也可能要求提供服务作为回报。这可以看作是来自你潜意识的要求--要求你做一些你知道你应该做，但你一直试图忽视的事情。另一方面，它可能是一个没有明显目的的神秘任务；这与你的内在神性是超越凡人理解的东西这一事实有关，你并不完全了解它需要或想要什么。",
	"Another possibility is that you're drawing on the Seeker community rather than reaching to the planes for assistance. One principle of the faith is that champions become undead so that they can help other Seekers. When you cast {@spell planar ally}, rather than calling a celestial or fiend, you might summon an undead champion of your faith; this could be anything from a vampire to a mummy lord or a death knight. In this case, the payment they demand for their service would likely be a tithe to the Seeker temple they are bound to. On a smaller scale, your DM could similarly decide that when you cast {@spell conjure celestial}, it summons a sarcastic flameskull instead of an angel.": "另一种可能性是，你在利用探索者群体，而不是向各星球寻求援助。信仰的一个原则是，冠军会变成不死之身，以便他们能帮助其他探索者。当你施展{@spell planar ally}时，你可能会召唤一个你信仰的不死战士，而不是召唤一个天神或魔鬼；这可能是任何东西，从吸血鬼到木乃伊领主或死亡骑士。在这种情况下，他们要求的报酬很可能是对他们所隶属的探索者神庙的什一税。在一个较小的范围内，你的管理员也可以决定，当你施放{@spell conjure celestial}时，它会召唤出一个讽刺的火焰骷髅，而不是一个天使。",
	"Throughout its history, the Blood of Vol has been treated with fear and suspicion by the people of the Five Nations. It's a faith that has dwelled in the shadows. This changed early in the Last War. His nation crippled by famine, King Kaius I accepted the aid of the Blood of Vol. The Seekers provided undead soldiers and necromantic expertise; with the resources of the crown behind them, Seekers developed necromantic rituals and weapons never before imagined. In exchange, Kaius elevated the Blood of Vol to the official state religion. Warlords were encouraged to embrace the faith, and Seeker families were given lands and titles.": "纵观其历史，沃尔之血一直被五国人民以恐惧和怀疑的态度对待。它是一种居住在阴影中的信仰。这种情况在最后一次战争初期发生了变化。寻求者提供了不死的士兵和亡灵魔法知识；在王室资源的支持下，寻求者开发了前所未有的亡灵魔法仪式和武器。作为交换，凯厄斯将沃尔之血提升为官方国教。军阀们被鼓励接受这一信仰，而探索者家族则获得了土地和称号。",
	"For a time, the Blood of Vol spread and was celebrated—or so it seemed. Most of the old warlord families still despised the Seekers and felt that the use of undead in battle debased the proud martial traditions of their ancestors. Toward the end of the war, Regent Moranna turned on the faith and the Blood of Vol became a scapegoat for all of Karrnath's troubles. Moranna claimed that the famines and plagues the people had suffered were caused by the Seekers. Its nobles were stripped of their lands. Chivalric orders of Seekers were disbanded. Some—notably the infamous Order of the Emerald Claw—refused to surrender, but most Seekers remained loyal to their nation even when it betrayed them.": "一时间，沃尔之血流传开来，受到人们的赞誉--或者说，看起来是这样。大多数老牌军阀家族仍然鄙视探索者，认为在战斗中使用不死生物贬低了他们祖先引以为豪的武术传统。在战争即将结束时，摄政王莫兰娜背叛了信仰，沃尔之血成为卡尔纳特所有问题的替罪羊。莫兰娜声称，人们遭受的饥荒和瘟疫是由探索者造成的。贵族们的土地被剥夺了。探索者的骑士团被解散了。有些人--特别是臭名昭著的翡翠之爪骑士团--拒绝投降，但大多数探索者仍然忠于他们的国家，即使他们背叛了他们。",
	"Today, the Blood of Vol has returned to the shadows, though there are still Seekers who serve the crown. Kaius III has sealed most of his undead forces in the crypts below Korth and Atur, but he isn't willing to entirely surrender this strategic advantage. Fort Bones and Fort Zombie remain bastions of loyal Seekers. But the faith is no longer celebrated, and the old warlord lines still mutter that they would have won the war if only they'd relied on skill and steel instead of foul magics. In playing a Karrnathi Seeker, do you support the crown and believe that Kaius III is only doing what he has to do to maintain the support of the warlords, or do you despise Kaius III and Moranna for betraying your faith?": "今天，沃尔之血已经回到了阴影中，尽管仍有为王室服务的探索者。凯乌斯三世将他的大部分亡灵部队封存在科思和阿图尔下面的地窖里，但他并不愿意完全放弃这一战略优势。骨头堡和僵尸堡仍然是忠诚的探索者们的堡垒。但信仰不再被颂扬，老军阀们还在嘀咕，只要他们依靠技巧和钢铁而不是肮脏的魔法，就能赢得战争。在扮演卡尔纳特探索者时，你是支持王室，相信凯乌斯三世只是为了维持军阀们的支持而做他必须做的事，还是鄙视凯乌斯三世和莫兰娜背叛了你的信仰？",
	"When creating a player character or NPC associated with the Blood of Vol, consider the following paths and which best fits your character.": "在创建与沃尔之血有关的玩家角色或NPC时，请考虑以下路径，以及哪条路径最适合你的角色。",
	"The Seekers of the Divinity Within are the largest and most widespread tradition associated with the Blood of Vol. The faith isn't as formally structured as the Church of the Silver Flame or even the Sovereign Host. For the most part, Seekers keep to themselves, living in their own villages and small towns or in isolated neighborhoods of larger communities, where they can practice their traditions without drawing the ire of their neighbors. The exception is the city of Atur: known as the City of Night, this remains the most public bastion of the Blood of Vol. Expanded and fortified during the Last War, Atur is the seat of Karrnath's necromantic research and development. While Kaius III has stripped the Blood of Vol of much of its standing, he still recognizes its potential value should the war begin anew, and many believe that he continues to provide support to Atur. The mummy lord Hass Malevanor is the high priest of Atur and the current spiritual leader of the faith. However, there are stories of undead champions who have guided and protected the Seekers for centuries. Sometimes known as the Crimson Covenant, these enigmatic figures may be the true power behind Atur.": "内在神性的探索者是与沃尔之血有关的最大和最广泛的传统。在大多数情况下，探索者们独来独往，住在自己的村庄和小镇上，或者住在大社区的偏僻街区，在那里他们可以实践自己的传统，而不会引起邻居们的愤怒。阿图尔城是个例外：它被称为 \"夜之城\"，仍然是沃尔之血最公开的堡垒。虽然凯乌斯三世已经剥夺了沃尔之血的大部分地位，但他仍然认识到，如果战争重新开始，它的潜在价值，而且许多人认为他继续向阿图尔提供支持。木乃伊领主哈斯-马勒瓦诺是阿图尔的大祭司，也是目前该信仰的精神领袖。然而，有一些关于亡灵冠军的故事，他们几个世纪以来一直在指导和保护探索者。这些神秘的人物有时被称为深红盟约，他们可能是阿图尔背后的真正力量。",
	"Outside Atur, for the most part, each Seeker community relies on their abactor—the priest that oversees a temple or community—and they rarely reach out to the world beyond. The largest temple in a region serves as a hub, coordinating with the other Seeker communities around it. But every community has its own stories and traditions and they're generally unconcerned with \"heresy\"; feel free to develop your character's own unique beliefs.": "在阿图尔之外，大部分情况下，每个探索者社区都依靠他们的守护者--监督寺庙或社区的牧师--他们很少接触到外面的世界。一个地区最大的寺庙是一个枢纽，与周围的其他探索者社区进行协调。但每个社区都有自己的故事和传统，他们一般不关心 \"异端\"；请自由发展你的角色的独特信仰。",
	"As an acolyte of the Blood of Vol, you've been ordained as a priest, but not bound to a single community as an abactor. You can receive shelter in any Seeker community. Are you following orders from Malevanor or the Crimson Covenant itself? Are you guided by visions from your own divinity within? As a Seeker hermit, you spent your time in isolation communing with your divinity within, and your Discovery may relate to the faith. Perhaps you have an insight into how to unlock your own power. Or perhaps you've learned a secret about the Crimson Covenant, and believe that a malevolent force is manipulating the faithful Seekers—can you find a way to bring down this ancient evil and free your people?": "作为沃尔之血的圣徒，你已经被任命为牧师，但不像修道者那样被约束在一个社区。你可以在任何一个探索者社区接受庇护。你是否听从玛勒瓦诺或深红圣约本身的命令？你是否被你自己内在的神性的幻象所指引？作为一个探索者隐士，你在与世隔绝的时间里与你内在的神性交流，而你的发现可能与信仰有关。也许你对如何释放你自己的力量有一种洞察力。或者你已经了解了一个关于深红盟约的秘密，并且相信有一股邪恶的力量正在操纵忠实的探索者--你能找到一种方法来打倒这个古老的邪恶并解放你的人民吗？",
	"The elves of the Bloodsail Principality occupy the island of Farlnen in the Lhazaar Principalities. The Bloodsails share the same roots as the Blood of Vol, as the principality was founded by Aereni exiles. However, they have followed a different path and hewn closer to the traditions of their ancestors. They don't believe in the divinity within and readily seek immortality through undeath. However, the island can only support a limited number of vampires, and Bloodsails must earn their afterlife by paying {@i velgys}—blood money—to the lords of the land. Those who fail to earn enough to buy a better afterlife are instead bound to objects after death. This is similar to the Aereni techniques described in chapter 2, but Bloodsail elves are often tied to ships and sails, enabling their vessels to move across a windless sea, sails driven by ghosts.": "血帆公国的精灵们占据着拉扎尔公国中的法尔宁岛。血帆公国与沃尔之血同根同源，因为该公国是由艾瑞尼的流亡者建立的。然而，他们走的是一条不同的道路，更接近于他们祖先的传统。他们不相信内在的神性，而是轻易地通过不死来寻求不朽。然而，这个岛屿只能支持有限数量的吸血鬼，血帆必须通过向土地的领主支付{@i velgys}--血钱来获得他们的来世。那些没能赚到足够的钱来买到更好的来世的人，死后反而会被束缚在物体上。这与第二章中描述的Aereni技术相似，但血帆精灵通常被绑在船和帆上，使他们的船只能够在无风的海上行驶，帆由鬼魂驱动。",

	"The Order of the Emerald Claw began as an elite military force comprised of devoted Seekers. When Regent Moranna turned on the Blood of Vol, the Emerald Claw refused to stand down. Today, members of the order include both Seeker extremists and Karrnathi patriots furious at Kaius III for embracing peace. The ultimate leader of the Emerald Claw is the lich known to most as the Queen of the Dead, though those in the inner circle know her to be the infamous Lady Illmarrow of Farlnen. She claims that her violent actions are for the good of Karrnath and the Blood of Vol, but in truth, they primarily benefit her and serve to spread terror.": "翡翠之爪骑士团最初是一支由忠诚的探索者组成的精英军事力量。当摄政王莫兰娜背叛沃尔之血时，翡翠之爪拒绝退缩。今天，该组织的成员包括探索者的极端分子和对凯厄斯三世拥抱和平感到愤怒的卡尔纳提爱国者。翡翠之爪的最终领导者是被大多数人称为 \"死亡女王 \"的巫师，但内部人员知道她是臭名昭著的法尔南的伊尔马罗女士。她声称她的暴力行动是为了卡尔纳特和沃尔之血的利益，但事实上，这些行动主要是为了让她自己受益，并用于传播恐怖。",

Or do you believe Kaius III is a traitor to your people?": "如果你想扮演一个没有翡翠之爪的反派关系的探索者老兵，玛瑙头骨骑士团是另一支由探索者组成的精英部队，但在莫兰娜的命令下解散了。作为沃尔之血的圣骑士，你可能是玛瑙头骨的一名骑士，在被国家抛弃后开始了冒险之旅。你是否仍然忠于卡尔纳特？或者你认为凯厄斯三世是你们民族的叛徒？",
	"The Seekers of the Divinity Within value community, urging the faithful to stand together. But there are others who follow the principles of the Blood of Vol who prefer to stand alone. The hermits known as Thieves of Life are determined to unlock their divinity within at any cost—not to help others, but solely to further their own quest for power and immortality. Thieves of Life are often master necromancers, but never become undead themselves; instead, they specialize in magics that allow them to drain the life from their foes.": "内部神性的探索者重视社区，敦促信徒们站在一起。但也有一些遵循沃尔之血原则的人喜欢独善其身。被称为 \"生命之贼 \"的隐士们决心不惜一切代价解开他们内在的神性--不是为了帮助别人，而只是为了促进他们自己对权力和不朽的追求。生命之贼通常是死灵法师，但自己从不成为不死之身；相反，他们擅长的魔法可以让他们吸干敌人的生命。",
	"As a hermit devoted to the Blood of Vol, you could choose the path of the Thief of Life. You are utterly devoted to the pursuit of your personal divinity, and your Discovery has likely shown you the path you must take. You might be a cleric, a Divine Soul sorcerer, or an Undying warlock (with your patron being your own nascent divinity within).

You may be utterly devoted to your quest for immortality—but what is your redeeming feature, your anchor to humanity?": "作为一个致力于沃尔之血的隐士，你可以选择 \"生命之贼 \"的道路。你完全致力于追求你个人的神性，而你的发现者很可能已经向你指明了你必须走的道路。你可能是一个牧师，一个神魂法师，或者是一个不死的术士（你的守护者是你自己内心新生的神性）。是什么将你和你的同伴联系在一起，他们为什么会选择与你交往？你可能完全献身于你对不朽的追求--但什么是你的救赎特征，你对人类的锚？",
	"An unusual option for a Thief of Life hermit is to say that you've actually been in a state of suspended animation for decades or even centuries—your Discovery was made on an inner journey. You were once far more powerful than you are today, but your powers have yet to return; as you gain levels, you are actually regaining the power you once had. If this is the case, it could be that one or more of your adventuring companions are actually descendants of yours; while you're obsessed with your quest for immortality, you also care about your own bloodline.": "对于生命之贼的隐士来说，一个不寻常的选择是说你实际上已经处于悬浮状态几十年甚至几个世纪了--你的发现是在一次内在旅行中做出的。你曾经比现在强大得多，但你的力量还没有恢复；随着你等级的提高，你实际上正在恢复你曾经拥有的力量。如果是这种情况，可能你的一个或多个冒险同伴实际上是你的后裔；当你沉迷于对不朽的追求时，你也关心自己的血脉。",

	"The Sovereign Host isn't a demanding religion, and there are many cultural variations and unique sects across Khorvaire. As a follower of this faith, you could feel an especially strong connection to a single deity, or you could have a general reverence for the pantheon as a whole. Do you believe that there is a particular Sovereign who guides your actions? Was there a key moment in your life where you felt the hand of one of the Sovereigns or Six?": "主权神并不是一个苛刻的宗教，整个霍尔韦尔有许多文化差异和独特的教派。作为这个信仰的追随者，你可能会觉得与某个单一的神灵有特别强烈的联系，或者你可能对整个万神殿有一种普遍的敬畏。你是否相信有一个特定的主宰在指导你的行动？在你的生活中是否有一个关键时刻，你感受到了其中一位或六位主宰的手？",
	"Followers of the Sovereign Host are generally called Vassals, but despite the shared name, they are anything but monolithic. Variations of the Sovereign Host can be found across Eberron in many different cultures—the Pyrinean Creed of humanity, the Rushemé faith of the giants of Xen'drik, the Cazhaak traditions of Droaam. Precise names and groupings change, but the faith's basic principles remain the same.": "主宰者的追随者通常被称为 \"附庸\"，但尽管有共同的名字，他们并不是铁板一块。在Eberron的许多不同文化中都能找到 \"主宰者 \"的变体--人类的皮里奈信条，Xen'drik巨人的Rushemé信仰，Droaam的Cazhaak传统。准确的名称和分组会发生变化，但信仰的基本原则仍然是一样的。",
	"The Sovereigns don't walk the world. No one expects to meet Dol Dorn in the flesh. To do so would, in fact, be unnecessary and limiting. You don't expect to meet Dol Dorn because you know he is with you every time a blade is drawn, ready to guide your hand. Aureon watches over the wizard studying magic and the judge presiding in court. The Devourer is present in every storm, and you can't fight him any more than you can defeat an earthquake with a sword. A true Vassal doesn't need proof of the Sovereigns' existence for the world itself is the proof.": "主权者不在世界范围内行走。没有人期望见到多尔-多恩的真面目。事实上，这样做是不必要的，也是有局限性的。你不期望见到多尔-多恩，因为你知道每次拔刀时他都和你在一起，随时准备引导你的手。奥瑞恩监视着研究魔法的巫师和主持法庭的法官。吞噬者存在于每一场风暴中，你无法与他对抗，就像你无法用剑击败一场地震一样。一个真正的附庸不需要证明君主的存在，因为世界本身就是证据。",
	"With that said, many myths depict the Sovereigns in the flesh, performing heroic acts and setting particular elements of creation in motion. These myths are set during the Age of Demons, and Vassal doctrine maintains that the Sovereigns defeated and bound the fiendish overlords. As the overlords previously ruled reality, once they were defeated, the Sovereigns ascended to fill that role. So there are stories of Dol Dorn performing tremendous feats of strength, and you might find an artifact said to be Onatar's hammer; but these date back to a mythic age when they were champions, not yet true Sovereigns.": "尽管如此，许多神话都描述了主权者的肉身，他们做出了英雄般的举动，并将特定的创造元素付诸行动。这些神话的背景是恶魔时代，瓦萨的学说认为，君主们打败了恶魔般的霸主并将其束缚。由于霸主之前统治着现实，一旦他们被打败，主宰们就会升起，填补这一角色。因此，有关于多尔-多恩发挥巨大力量的故事，你可能会发现一件据说是奥纳塔的锤子的文物；但这些可以追溯到神话时代，那时他们是冠军，还不是真正的主权者。",
	"Every culture depicts the Sovereigns in different ways. The giants depict them as giants while the Pyrinean Creed (discussed in a later section) depicts them as humans. Many cultures use draconic imagery to represent the Sovereigns. But since the Sovereigns don't manifest physically, any representation of them is purely symbolic. Dol Dorn is the Warrior, Onatar is the Smith—any image that clearly depicts these concepts will do.": "每种文化都以不同的方式来描绘圣主。巨人将他们描绘成巨人，而皮里奈信条（在后面的章节中讨论）将他们描绘成人类。许多文化都使用龙人的意象来代表主权者。但由于主宰者没有身体上的表现，对他们的任何表现都纯粹是象征性的。多尔-多恩是战士，奥纳塔是史密斯--任何能清楚描述这些概念的形象都可以。",
	"The Sovereigns are everywhere, offering guidance to anyone who will listen. Due to the personal nature of this faith, it doesn't have the same degree of organization and hierarchy as the Silver Flame. A large community generally has an eight-sided temple to the Sovereign Host, staffed by full-time priests. In smaller villages and towns, there might be an untended shrine or a local person who is considered to be especially close to a Sovereign and performs ceremonies. In the town of Riverford, the innkeeper Dara is said to speak with Boldrei's voice; she's the pillar of the community, and people come to her with their problems and disputes.": "主权者无处不在，向任何愿意倾听的人提供指导。由于这种信仰的个人性质，它没有像银色火焰那样的组织和等级制度的程度。一个大的社区一般都有一个八面玲珑的主神庙，由全职祭司负责。在较小的村镇，可能会有一个无人看管的神龛，或者有一个被认为与某位圣主特别亲近的当地人，并举行仪式。在里弗福镇，据说旅馆老板达拉会用波德雷的声音说话；她是社区的支柱，人们有问题和纠纷都会来找她。",
	"A Sovereign priest's role isn't simply as an intermediary to the divine; anyone can talk to the Sovereigns. Instead, priests offer guidance and clarity, helping you understand the path you're on. A temple or priest often serves another function beyond their religious duties; the Great Hall of Aureon in Sharn is a library as well as a temple, while you might find a shrine to Kol Korran at the center of the public market. Priests serve as teachers, mediators, and guides, but they are often also subject matter experts in the path tied to the Sovereign they serve.": "主权祭司的作用并不只是作为神的中介；任何人都可以与主权者交谈。相反，牧师提供指导和澄清，帮助你了解你所走的道路。寺庙或祭司往往在宗教职责之外还有其他功能；沙恩的奥瑞恩大殿既是图书馆，也是寺庙，而你可能会在公共市场的中心找到科尔-科兰的神龛。祭司作为教师、调解员和向导，但他们往往也是与他们所服务的君主联系在一起的道路上的主题专家。",
	"In creating a Vassal character, think about your personal relationship to the Sovereigns. Who do you feel particularly close to? Do you feel you are blessed or directly guided by a Sovereign? Is there a point in your life where you believe one of the Sovereigns intervened on your behalf?": "在创造一个附庸角色时，想想你与君主的个人关系。你觉得与谁特别亲近？你是否觉得自己受到了某位君主的祝福或直接指导？在你的生活中，是否有一个点是你认为某个君主为你进行干预的？",
	"When human settlers came from Sarlona, they brought the Sovereign Host with them. While some traditions have evolved over the course of centuries and civilizations, the Pyrinean interpretation of the Sovereigns is part of the very foundation of the Five Nations, and its creed is reflected in their values. You should follow the laws (Aureon) and value the traditions of your community (Boldrei). Industry (Onatar) and commerce (Kol Korran) are encouraged, though greed (the Keeper) is not. On the battlefield, you should fight with courage (Dol Dorn) and honor (Dol Arrah), while not engaging in needless cruelty (the Mockery). You should trust in Aureon's laws and not take vengeance into your own hands (the Fury).": "当人类定居者从萨尔罗纳来到这里时，他们带来了主宰者。虽然一些传统在几个世纪和文明的进程中不断演变，但皮林纳人对主权者的解释是五国基础的一部分，其信条反映在他们的价值观中。你应该遵守法律（Aureon），重视社区的传统（Boldrei）。工业（Onatar）和商业（Kol Korran）受到鼓励，但贪婪（守护者）则不受鼓励。在战场上，你应该以勇气（多尔-多恩）和荣誉（多尔-阿拉）而战，同时不参与无谓的残酷行为（嘲笑者）。你应该相信奥瑞恩的法律，不要把复仇掌握在自己手中（愤怒）。",
	"Beyond these basic values, the Sovereigns are ubiquitous in the Five Nations. When you go into a courtroom, you stand on an Eye of Aureon. Standard marriage ceremonies invoke Boldrei. Many people aren't devoted Vassals and don't actually believe the Sovereigns are guiding their every action. But even such pragmatists recall the names of each Sovereign, know many of their songs, and will celebrate Wildnight or Boldrei's Feast. By and large, if you live in the Five Nations, it's assumed you're a Vassal unless you specifically say you're not.": "除了这些基本价值之外，主权者在五国中无处不在。当你进入法庭时，你站在奥里昂之眼上。标准的结婚仪式会引用波德莱。许多人并不是虔诚的附庸，实际上并不相信君主们在指导他们的每一个行动。但即使是这样的实用主义者也会记得每个君主的名字，知道他们的许多歌曲，并会庆祝野夜或Boldrei的节日。总的来说，如果你住在五国，就会被认为是附庸，除非你明确说你不是附庸。",
	"The giants of Xen'drik raised temples to Ouralon Lawbringer long before humanity embraced Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Hunters in Aundair give thanks to Balinor, but orcs in the Shadow Marches invoke Baalkan the Beastlord, while the Talenta halflings tell stories of clever Bally-Nur.": "在人类拥护法律和传说的君主奥瑞恩之前，Xen'drik的巨人就已经为奥瑞恩--法律使者建立了寺庙。昂代尔（Aundair）的猎人感谢巴里诺（Balinor），但阴影地带的兽人则召唤野兽之王巴尔坎（Baalkan），而塔伦塔（Talenta）的半身人则讲述聪明的巴里诺（Bally-Nur）的故事。",
	"Some of this is a natural process of syncretism. The Marcher orcs blended their original beliefs with the traditions of human settlers. But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name—and if the deity's name is similar to \"Balinor,\" the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game—it's easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.": "这其中有一些是自然的融合过程。游行者兽人将他们的原始信仰与人类定居者的传统相融合。但是塔伦塔人在遇到人类之前就已经在讲述他们的故事了。虽然学者们争论其中的原因，但大多数人都同意，一个传统与一个典型的主权者越相似，就越容易从该信仰中汲取神圣的力量。一个召唤狩猎之神的文化比一个崇拜同名巨型鲑鱼的文化更容易产生牧师和圣骑士--如果神灵的名字与 \"Balinor \"相似，那么与神圣魔法的联系将更加容易。Vassals的圣人断言这证明了主权者的存在，而怀疑者则说这可能只是一个数字游戏--从共同的信仰中汲取力量更容易，而对主权者的信仰已经达到了临界质量。",
	"Because of this diversity, Vassal priests are rarely concerned with heresy. Those who follow the Pyrinean Creed may attempt to correct what they see as flawed beliefs, but ultimately, most just smile at the ignorance of the Marcher orc, content in the knowledge that {@i they} know the proper names of the Sovereigns. Likewise, while player characters and NPCs may choose to follow one of the paths described below, you can always develop a unique twist on tradition or introduce a new cult that worships a specific grouping of Sovereigns. This openness is also reflected in Vassal interactions with the Church of the Silver Flame. The Pyrinean Creed asserts that the Sovereigns defeated the overlords at the dawn of time; if the Silver Flame is what keeps the overlords bound, presumably the Sovereigns created it. So there's no inherent conflict; rather, a Vassal will simply shrug and say, \"But why do you worship a cage?\"": "由于这种多样性，瓦萨的牧师们很少关注异端。那些遵循皮里奈信条的人可能会试图纠正他们认为有缺陷的信仰，但最终，大多数人只是对行军兽人的无知微笑，满足于知道（%0%）知道主权者的正确名字。同样，虽然玩家角色和NPC可以选择遵循下面描述的路径之一，但你总是可以对传统进行独特的扭曲，或者引入一个新的崇拜特定君主群体的邪教。这种开放性也反映在附庸与银焰教会的互动中。皮里奈的信条宣称，主权者在时间之初就击败了霸主；如果银色火焰是让霸主受到约束的东西，那么据推测，是主权者创造了它。所以没有内在的冲突；相反，附庸者会简单地耸耸肩说：\"但你为什么要崇拜一个笼子？\"",
	"The Sovereigns are worshiped in many different configurations and forms. A particular community could be devoted to a single Sovereign, or it could present a Sovereign and member of the Dark Six as being allied forces (as seen with the Restful Watch). A few of the best-known variants are described below.": "人们以许多不同的配置和形式来崇拜君主。一个特定的社区可能致力于一个单一的君主，也可能将一个君主和黑暗六神的成员作为联盟的力量来呈现（如在安息日所见）。下面介绍几个最知名的变体。",
	"The standard names and attributes of the Sovereigns and Six as presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}—Aureon, Balinor, the Shadow—are drawn from the Pyrinean Creed, the dominant tradition within the Five Nations. This is the source of the Octogram symbol, the division of Nine and Six, and holy days like Boldrei's Feast. If you follow the Pyrinean Creed, you believe in the faith as it's presented in the core Eberron sourcebooks. You recognize all of the Sovereigns and Six, even if you may feel that one in particular is especially influential in your life.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中提出的君主和六人组的标准名称和属性--奥里昂、巴里诺、影子--都来自五国内部的主导传统--皮里奈信条。这是八角形符号、九和六的划分以及博尔德雷节等圣日的来源。如果你追随皮里纳信条，你就会相信Eberron核心资料手册中所介绍的信仰。你承认所有的君主和六人组，即使你可能觉得其中一个在你的生活中特别有影响力。",
	"While the common faithful know the term \"Pyrinean Creed,\" its history is largely only of interest to scholars and priests. A typical Vassal might know that they believe in the Pyrinean Creed, but if you asked five of them what Pyrine was, you'd get five different answers—\"He was a legendary missionary!\" \"It was an old town in Daskara where there was a council!\" In reality, these beliefs were codified thousands of years ago in the Sarlonan nation of Pyrine, then carried to Khorvaire by human settlers. While Pyrine was assimilated by the Empire of Riedra over a thousand years ago and its people no longer worship the Sovereign Host, their legacy lives on in Khorvaire.": "虽然普通信徒知道 \"皮林信条 \"这个词，但它的历史基本上只有学者和牧师才感兴趣。一个典型的瓦萨人可能知道他们相信皮林信条，但如果你问五个人皮林是什么，你会得到五个不同的答案--\"他是一个传奇的传教士！\" \"那是达斯卡拉的一个古镇，那里有一个议会！\" 实际上，这些信仰是几千年前在撒隆人的皮林国编纂的，然后由人类定居者带到了霍尔韦尔。虽然皮林在一千多年前被里德拉帝国同化，它的人民不再崇拜主宰者，但他们的遗产在霍尔韦尔继续存在。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} assigns domains to individual Sovereigns, but Pyrinean priests can often perform the rites of any Sovereign, invoking the deity most appropriate to the current situation. In creating a Sovereign cleric, you can assert that you have a close tie to a particular Sovereign and primarily speak on their behalf; in this case, use the domain associated with that Sovereign. For example, the {@class cleric||Life|life} domain is a good option for a cleric who speaks for all Sovereigns equally, as it provides a general ability to protect your allies and community; and the {@class cleric||Knowledge|knowledge} domain makes sense for a priest who's more scholar than warrior.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}将领域分配给各个主权者，但皮林纳的牧师通常可以执行任何主权者的仪式，召唤最适合当前情况的神灵。在创建君主教士时，你可以断言你与某位君主关系密切，并主要代表他们说话；在这种情况下，使用与该君主相关的领域。例如，对于一个平等地代表所有君主说话的牧师来说，{@class cleric||Life|life}领域是一个很好的选择，因为它提供了一种保护你的盟友和社区的一般能力；而对于一个学者多于战士的牧师来说，{@class cleric||Knowledge|knowledge}领域是有意义的。",
	"The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant worships the Sovereigns in the same groupings and names as the Pyrinean Creed. However, the church asserts that the champions who fought the overlords were dragons, depicting them as such. The church is very focused on wealth and economic power; members are expected to contribute to the hoard of their local temple, and the priests often engage in behavior that outsiders might consider to be corrupt. They hold the unorthodox belief that mortals can ascend to become Sovereigns themselves—that by emulating a particular Sovereign, a mortal can eventually take their place. Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon. While this Sovereign ascension is believed to occur after death, some priests teach that devoted members—especially those who donate great sums to the temple hoard—can actually become dragons in life. While this seems unlikely, it could be an interesting background for a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer; it's not that you have draconic ancestry, but rather, due to your devotion, you appear to be evolving into a dragon.": "升龙教会以与皮里纳信条相同的分组和名称崇拜主宰者。然而，该教会宣称与霸主作战的冠军是龙，将他们描绘成龙。教会非常注重财富和经济实力；成员们要为当地神庙的囤积物做贡献，牧师们经常从事外人可能认为是腐败的行为。他们持有一种非正统的信念，即凡人可以自己升华为君主--通过模仿某位君主，凡人最终可以取代他们的位置。流行的传言认为，科兰伯格图书馆的创始人多里斯-阿莱尔-伊尔-科兰，建造图书馆是为了继承奥瑞恩的衣钵。虽然这种主权的提升被认为是在死后发生的，但一些牧师教导说，虔诚的成员--特别是那些向神庙囤积的巨额捐赠者--实际上可以在生活中变成龙。虽然这似乎不太可能，但对于龙族血统的巫师来说，这可能是一个有趣的背景；并不是说你有龙族的血统，而是由于你的奉献，你似乎正在进化成一条龙。",
	"Wyrm Ascendant Vassals believe the dragons themselves are divine tools and emissaries of the Sovereigns and Six, though few dragons have ever acknowledged the church in any way.

They can be found in every major city in the Five Nations, and even smaller towns may have a devotee of the Watch tending the boneyard. The Restful Watch maintains that the souls of the dead pass through Dolurrh into the realm of the Sovereigns—unless they are snatched by the Keeper's greedy talons. One of a priest's most important duties is helping bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or sacrifices sufficient to distract the Keeper and ensure the deceased's soul reaches Dolurrh. For a simple person with few achievements, a single coin might suffice.

	"Faithful of the Watch rarely discuss another aspect of their faith with outsiders—that once a soul rises to the realm of the Sovereigns, it can never return. The Restful Watch believes that if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, so it can be restored when the time is right. Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.": "守望先锋的信徒们很少与外人讨论他们信仰的另一个方面--一旦灵魂升到主权者的境界，就再也回不来了。守夜人认为，如果奥瑞恩知道一个死去的英雄在未来会被需要，他就会让守夜人在灵魂到达多鲁尔之前将其抢走，这样就可以在时机成熟时将其恢复。因此，虽然守夜人主要敬重奥瑞恩，但他们也理解和尊重守护者，并相信他有重要的作用。",

On the one hand, they honor particular groupings of the Sovereigns and Six, asserting that there are members of the Six with something valuable to offer worshippers. Beyond this, the cults are also secret societies—a form of fraternal order that binds people together even if they aren't truly invested in the religious aspects of the cult.

	"honors Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and Dol Azur (the Mockery). It was part of the united armies of Galifar, and cult chapters can be found in all of the armies of the Five Nations. Sect meetings provide a place for soldiers and veterans to interact as friends and equals, regardless of rank or nationality. The cult asserts that honor and courage are to be valued, but there is also a time and place for cunning and cruelty, even if it is never to be desired.": "荣耀多尔-阿拉、多尔-多恩和多尔-阿苏尔（嘲讽）。它是加利法尔联合军队的一部分，在五国的所有军队中都能找到邪教的分会。教派会议为士兵和退伍军人提供了一个作为朋友和平等交流的场所，不分等级或国籍。邪教主张重视荣誉和勇气，但也有狡猾和残忍的时间和地点，即使它永远不被人看好。",
	"honors Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (the Devourer). Sects are usually found in rural communities, and include farmers, hunters, and all manner of wanderers. The Three Faces of the Wild supports agriculture and hunting, but recognizes that the wild cannot be fully tamed. Members sometimes engage in ritual sacrifices or the burning of fields or other acts of destruction. They believe that the Devourer must have his due—and by making their chosen offerings, they keep him from striking elsewhere.": "阿拉瓦伊、巴里诺和沙冈（吞噬者）的荣誉。教派通常出现在农村社区，包括农民、猎人和各种形式的流浪者。野性三面派支持农业和狩猎，但承认野性不可能被完全驯服。成员们有时会进行祭祀活动，或焚烧田地或其他破坏行为。他们相信吞噬者必须得到他应得的东西--通过提供他们选择的祭品，他们阻止他在其他地方攻击。",
	"When priests of the Sovereign Host cast spells such as {@spell commune} or {@spell planar ally}, they usually interact with celestials from the planes. Typically, this is a celestial that embodies the same concept as the Sovereign in question; when a Vassal priest casts {@spell conjure celestial} in Dol Arrah's name, a warlike angel may come from Shavarath. When a celestial speaks the name of a Sovereign, listeners will hear the name they are most familiar with, whether that's Balinor, Baalkan, or Bally-Nur. As such, some scholars assert that it's slightly unclear if a summoned angel serves \"Dol Arrah,\" or if it instead serves \"Honor in War\" and it's just being translated as Dol Arrah. If asked such a pedantic question, both the angel and a devout Vassal might simply respond with, \"What's the difference? Dol Arrah is honor in war.\"": "当圣主的牧师们施展诸如{@spell commune}或{@spell planar ally}的法术时，他们通常会与来自各星球的天人互动。通常，这是一个体现了与相关主宰相同概念的天人；当瓦萨牧师以多尔-阿拉的名义施展（%2%）时，一个好战的天使可能来自沙瓦拉斯。当天人说出君主的名字时，听众会听到他们最熟悉的名字，无论那是巴里诺、巴尔坎还是巴里努尔。因此，一些学者断言，稍微不清楚被召唤的天使是为 \"多尔-阿拉 \"服务，还是相反为 \"战争中的荣誉 \"服务，只是被翻译成了多尔-阿拉。如果被问到这样一个迂腐的问题，天使和虔诚的瓦萨都可能简单地回答：\"有什么区别？Dol Arrah是战争中的荣誉\"。",
	"The Sovereigns embody pillars of civilization: agriculture, commerce, industry, honor, law. The Dark Six represent frightening and destructive forces, their existence explaining why bad things happen in the world. When a wildfire destroys a village, the Devourer is to blame. When someone commits a crime of passion, they were overcome by the Fury. When monsters prey on the innocent, good people curse the Shadow.": "主权者体现了文明的支柱：农业、商业、工业、荣誉、法律。黑暗六人组代表可怕的破坏性力量，他们的存在解释了为什么世界上会发生坏事。当一场野火摧毁了一个村庄时，吞噬者应受到谴责。当有人犯下激情犯罪时，他们被 \"愤怒 \"所征服。当怪物掠夺无辜者时，善良的人们会诅咒阴影。",
	"The Pyrinean Creed exhorts that the Dark Six should be shunned, teaching their names and aspects so that people can recognize their works and understand how to resist them. When Pyrinean Vassals do make offerings to the Dark Six, it's usually as an act of desperation: begging the Devourer to calm storm-tossed waters or calling on the Fury to enact a terrible revenge when the law has failed. However, there are those in the Five Nations and beyond who see the Dark Six as powers to be respected and worshiped in their own right. This section presents a brief overview of the Dark Six and how their followers can be encountered in the Five Nations. These descriptions expand on the material presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, further developing the roles of these deities. The monsters of Droaam also have a quite different view of the Sovereigns and Six, explored in more detail in chapter 4.": "皮里纳信条劝告人们应该避开黑暗六神，教导他们的名字和方面，以便人们能够识别他们的作品并了解如何抵制他们。当皮林尼亚的臣民向黑暗六神献祭时，通常是出于无奈：乞求吞噬者平息风暴之水，或在法律失效时呼唤怒火来实施可怕的复仇行动。然而，在五国和其他国家，也有一些人将黑暗六人组视为值得尊重和崇拜的力量，他们有自己的权利。本节简要介绍了黑暗六人组的情况，以及在五国中如何遇到他们的追随者。这些描述是对{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中的材料的扩展，进一步发展了这些神祗的作用。德罗亚姆的怪物们对君主和六人组也有相当不同的看法，在第四章中会有更详细的探讨。",
	"Nature's wrath": "大自然的愤怒",
	"The Devourer is the tsunami that overwhelms the tallest ship, the wildfire that consumes the grandest castle, the earthquake that levels the most glorious city. He is the vast and primordial power of nature, a force that will break any chain and wear down the strongest wall. The Devourer is the glorious cruelty that drives the predator, the cry of the hawk and the howl of the wolf. He is all that is wild, savage, and unknowable. He is the deepest ocean, a force that can be crossed but never controlled.": "吞噬者是压倒最高船只的海啸，是吞噬最宏伟城堡的野火，是夷平最光辉城市的地震。他是自然界巨大而原始的力量，是一种可以打破任何链条、磨灭最坚固墙壁的力量。吞噬者是驱使捕食者的光荣的残酷，是鹰的叫声和狼的嚎叫。他是所有野性、野蛮和不可知的东西。他是最深的海洋，一种可以跨越但永远无法控制的力量。",
	"Those who fear the Devourer see him as an entirely destructive force. Arawai is the patron of agriculture, of peacefully harvesting nature's bounty. Balinor is the patron of the hunt, of civilized folk using bow, spear, and skill to challenge or tame the mightiest beasts. These deities reflect the power of civilization to harness and control the natural world, but the Devourer puts the lie to this, showing that nature will never be truly tamed.": "那些害怕吞噬者的人认为他是一种完全的破坏性力量。阿拉威是农业的守护神，和平地收获大自然的恩惠。巴里诺（Balinor）是狩猎的守护神，文明人使用弓箭、长矛和技巧挑战或驯服最强大的猛兽。这些神灵反映了文明驾驭和控制自然界的力量，但 \"吞噬者 \"却对其进行了否定，表明自然界永远不会被真正驯服。",
	"Those who embrace the Devourer celebrate the glorious power of the wilds. They revel in the raging storm and gladly embrace their predatory instincts. They accept that nature is often bloody and cruel, and don't hesitate to follow its example. But while it may be harsh, nature is rarely evil. Priests of the Devourer often urge their parishioners to follow their instincts, or teach people to live in accord with nature instead of forcing their will upon it. They may serve as intermediaries, convincing the Devourer to redirect his wrath and spare their followers—or to turn his rage against their enemies.": "那些拥护吞噬者的人庆祝荒野的光荣力量。他们陶醉于汹涌的风暴，欣然接受自己的掠夺本能。他们接受自然界往往是血腥和残酷的，并毫不犹豫地效仿它。但是，虽然它可能是严酷的，但自然界很少是邪恶的。吞噬者的牧师经常敦促他们的教友遵循他们的本能，或者教导人们顺应自然，而不是将他们的意志强加于自然。他们可能充当中间人，说服吞噬者改变其愤怒的方向，放过他们的追随者，或者将其怒火转向他们的敌人。",
	"Passion, revenge": "激情、复仇",
	"The Fury is a silent whisper that can drive you to doubt or despair. She is reckless rage and all-consuming passion. Instinct is the voice of the Fury, guiding us when rational thought fails. And she is the Sovereign of revenge, promising vengeance to those willing to surrender to her. Her father the Devourer embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control.": "愤怒是一种无声的低语，可以使你产生怀疑或绝望。她是不计后果的愤怒和无休止的激情。本能是 \"愤怒 \"的声音，在理性思考失败时引导我们。她是复仇的主宰，向那些愿意向她投降的人承诺复仇。她的父亲 \"吞噬者 \"体现了我们外部风暴的破坏力；\"愤怒 \"是我们内心深处的风暴，是我们努力控制的疯狂情绪。",
	"Devotees of the Fury generally follow one of two paths. Revelers believe that suppressing emotion causes anguish, and that people should embrace their emotions fully and act on impulse and instinct. They hold wild, ecstatic celebrations as a way for participants to throw off the chains of civilization for a moment and experience life and emotion fully. A player character who follows this path might be a Berserker barbarian or a bard using the {@class bard||College of Glamour|glamour|XGE}—either embracing their own primal emotion or inspiring it in others. A sorcerer might attribute their power to wild emotion; they can only access their magic when they let the Fury guide them.": "怒火的信徒一般遵循两条道路中的一条。狂欢者认为，压抑情感会导致痛苦，人们应该充分拥抱自己的情感，凭冲动和本能行事。他们举行狂热的庆祝活动，作为一种方式，让参与者暂时抛开文明的枷锁，充分体验生活和情感。走这条路的玩家角色可能是一个狂暴的野蛮人或使用（%0%）的吟游诗人--要么拥抱自己的原始情感，要么在别人身上激发它。一个巫师可能将他们的力量归结为狂野的情感；他们只有在让愤怒引导他们的时候才能使用他们的魔法。",
	"The other path of the Fury is the road of revenge. People who have suffered grievously can call on the Fury to give them the will and strength to take vengeance into their own hands. Or rather than seeking revenge themselves, one tradition calls for someone who has been wronged to place a red candle in a window, inscribed with the name of their tormentor. This is an invitation for the Fury to take vengeance on their behalf. A player character following this path could be charged to investigate and fulfill these calls for revenge. While this could be the path of a cleric or paladin, it could just as easily suit an {@class rogue||Assassin|assassin} rogue, a bard of the {@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}, or a warlock.": "愤怒之神的另一条道路是复仇之路。遭受不幸的人可以呼唤 \"愤怒 \"给他们意志和力量，让他们自己去复仇。或者，与其自己寻求复仇，一个传统要求受了委屈的人在窗户上放一根红蜡烛，上面刻着折磨者的名字。这是对愤怒之神的邀请，请他代表他们进行复仇。走这条路的玩家角色可以负责调查并完成这些复仇的召唤。虽然这可能是牧师或圣骑士的道路，但它也很容易适合{@class rogue||Assassin|assassin}游荡者、{@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}吟游诗人或术士。",
	"Death, greed, hoarding": "死亡、贪婪、囤积",
	"Every Vassal knows they should never flaunt good fortune, avoiding arrogance and pride. Those who crow too loudly may catch the jealous eye of the Keeper. Even the mightiest hero can be laid low by disease or ill fortune, as the Keeper has a vast arsenal to bring down those that he desires. Once he pulls you down into the darkness, he will snatch your soul before it can reach Dolurrh and add you to his endless hoard, where he can toy with you and torment you until the end of time.": "每个附庸都知道他们不应该炫耀好运，避免傲慢和自大。那些过于喧嚣的人可能会引起守护者嫉妒的目光。即使是最强大的英雄也会被疾病或厄运击倒，因为守护者有一个巨大的武器库来击倒他所希望的人。一旦他把你拉到黑暗中，他就会在你的灵魂到达多鲁尔之前抢走你的灵魂，把你加入他无尽的囤积中，在那里他可以玩弄你，折磨你，直到时间的尽头。",
	"The Keeper is the patron of those who put personal gain above all else. He guides those who use guile to gain gold, regardless of the cost to others. A rogue who invokes Olladra sees themselves as the hero of the story; one who calls on the Keeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals—though his bargains are always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make these deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are often abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could bargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for fame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous, there's no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to anticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die. This could easily be a part of the backstory of a player character. Did your entertainer make a bargain with the Keeper?": "守护者是那些将个人利益置于一切之上的人的守护者。他引导那些使用诡计获得金币的人，而不考虑其他人的代价。援引奥拉德拉的流氓认为自己是故事中的英雄；而召唤守护者的人则对成为反派毫无顾忌。除了引导那些把利益放在首位的人，守护者还以愿意做交易而闻名--尽管他的交易总是对他有利。被称为 \"爪牙 \"的祭司代表守护者进行这些交易，尽管这些条件通常是抽象的，而且纯粹是由信仰驱动的。一个艺人可以和塔隆讨价还价，用他们十年的生命换取名声；即使这个艺人后来成名了，也无法知道这是否是讨价还价的结果，也无法预料这个艺人何时会突然死亡。这很容易成为玩家角色的背景故事的一部分。你的艺人是否与守护者达成了交易？",
	"Another possible path for a player character or deadly NPC is that of being a Keeper's Fang. These people receive visions of things that the Keeper wishes to add to his hoard; these are usually the souls of specific people, but they could also be artifacts or other unique treasures. This is an interesting path for an {@class rogue||Assassin|assassin} rogue, an {@class paladin||Oathbreaker|oathbreaker|DMG} paladin, or a {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} warlock.": "玩家角色或致命的NPC的另一个可能的途径是成为守护者的方。这些人收到了守护者希望加入他的仓库的东西的幻象；这些东西通常是特定人的灵魂，但也可能是神器或其他独特的宝物。对于{@class rogue||Assassin|assassin}游侠、{@class paladin||Oathbreaker|oathbreaker|DMG}圣骑士或{@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}术士来说，这是一个有趣的途径。",
	"Betrayal and bloodshed": "背叛和流血事件",
	"Dol Arrah will show you how to fight with honor, Dol Dorn will grant you courage, and when you die, at least you'll know you did so bravely and honorably. The Mockery will drag you through mud and blood, drive you to betray your principles and employ tactics that horrify your allies and enemies alike—but at the end of the day, you'll be standing over the corpse of your foe. Which path will you follow?": "多尔亚拉会告诉你如何光荣地战斗，多尔多恩会赋予你勇气，当你死亡时，至少你会知道你是勇敢地、光荣地完成了任务。嘲笑会把你拖入泥潭和血泊中，驱使你背叛你的原则，采用让你的盟友和敌人都感到恐惧的战术--但在一天结束时，你会站在敌人的尸体上。你会走哪条路？",
	"Those who despise the Dark Six condemn the Mockery as a villain, a monster who encourages cruel and treacherous behavior. This can be as simple as ambushing an enemy, using stealth instead of facing them openly. Or it can mean slaughtering innocents, torturing your foes, breaking a truce—anything to bring you victory. Those who embrace the path of the Mockery may say that such tactics are the only way to bring down a superior foe. Honor is a luxury for the strong; for those who are weak and oppressed, victory is all that truly matters.": "那些鄙视黑暗六人组的人谴责嘲笑者是一个恶棍，一个鼓励残忍和奸诈行为的怪物。这可以是简单的伏击敌人，使用隐身术而不是公开面对他们。也可以是屠杀无辜者，折磨你的敌人，破坏停战协议--任何能给你带来胜利的事情。那些拥护嘲讽之路的人可能会说，这种战术是打倒优势敌人的唯一方法。荣誉是强者的奢侈品；对于那些弱者和被压迫者来说，胜利才是真正重要的。",
	"Others who follow the Mockery assert that the very idea of honor in war is delusional. Pain, terror, and death are the inevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the Mockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin who kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a weakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation—all these might view the Mockery as an ally. While this can be a dark path for a player character to follow, a hero could use the techniques of the Mockery in pursuit of a noble cause. A grim vigilante who uses stealth and fear to terrify cowardly criminals into changing their ways could be guided by the Mockery.": "其他追随 \"嘲笑 \"的人断言，在战争中获得荣誉的想法本身就是妄想。痛苦、恐怖和死亡是暴力的必然结果；至少那些追随Mockery的人承认其他人否认的事实。毫无征兆地杀人的刺客，视仁慈为弱点的野蛮人，培养可怕名声的海盗--所有这些人都可能将Mockery视为盟友。虽然对于玩家角色来说，这可能是一条黑暗的道路，但英雄可以使用Mockery的技术来追求一个崇高的事业。一个使用隐身术和恐惧来吓唬胆小的罪犯使其改过自新的严峻的义务警员，可以由Mockery指导。",
	"Ambition and temptation, forbidden knowledge, monsters": "野心和诱惑，禁忌的知识，怪兽",
	"The war between the Shadow and Aureon rages in all of us. Aureon's voice tells us that we are stronger together, that it's worth it to suffer for the sake of the common good. The Shadow whispers that there is no common good—all that matters is what you need and what you can do. Why should you make sacrifices for others instead of doing what's best for yourself? Why should you give when you can take?": "影子和奥里昂之间的战争在我们所有人的心中肆虐。奥瑞恩的声音告诉我们，我们在一起会更强大，为了共同的利益而受苦是值得的。影子低声说，没有共同利益--所有重要的是你需要什么，你能做什么。你为什么要为别人做出牺牲，而不是做对自己最有利的事情？你为什么要在你能得到的时候给予？",
	"The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition. Those who revere it view this as a positive trait; the Shadow will show you how to be the best you can be. But how far will you go in pursuit of your ambition? What—or who—will you sacrifice? Priests who embrace this aspect of the Shadow call themselves Mentors, emphasizing that they can show you how to achieve your full potential; others call them Tempters, as they will always drive you down the darkest path. The Pyrinean Creed says that the Shadow consumes the souls of those who fall prey to its temptation; a Mentor will tell you that this is exactly the sort of lie the Sovereigns use to trick you into following their rules.": "影子是野心的主宰者。那些崇尚它的人认为这是一个积极的特征；影子会告诉你如何成为最好的人。但是，为了追求你的野心，你会走多远？你会牺牲什么或谁？拥抱影子这一方面的牧师称自己为导师，强调他们可以告诉你如何实现你的全部潜力；其他人称他们为诱惑者，因为他们总是会把你赶到最黑暗的路上。皮里纳信条说，影子会吞噬那些受其诱惑的人的灵魂；导师会告诉你，这正是君主用来欺骗你遵守他们规则的谎言。",
	"The Shadow is also the keeper of forbidden knowledge, of secrets you know you shouldn't pursue. This includes arcane magic—granting powers virtuous people should shun (see the Forbidden Magic sidebar for ideas about this). Any spellcasting character could attribute their powers to the Shadow; a wizard might have been struggling with their studies, but after a sacrifice to the Shadow, they awoke with new insights. The Shadow can also serve as a warlock's patron, likely in the role of the {@class warlock||Fiend|fiend} or the {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}. While the Shadow won't interact directly with a warlock, they could receive visions like a priest; they could interact with a fiend who claims to speak for the Shadow; or they could be mistaken about the nature of their patron, and actually be bound to the overlord Sul Khatesh.": "影子也是禁忌知识的守护者，是你知道你不应该追求的秘密。这包括奥秘的魔法--赋予有德行的人应该回避的力量（见禁忌魔法侧边栏的想法）。任何法术角色都可以把他们的力量归功于影子；一个巫师可能一直在努力学习，但在向影子献祭后，他们以新的洞察力醒来了。影子也可以作为术士的守护者，可能是以（%0%）或（%1%）的角色。虽然影子不会直接与术士互动，但他们可以像牧师一样收到异象；他们可以与声称代表影子说话的恶魔互动；或者他们可能误解了他们的守护者的性质，实际上是与霸主Sul Khatesh绑定。",
	"In addition to mystical knowledge, priests of the Shadow often know things they simply shouldn't know—secrets that can harm people if revealed. Priests of the Shadow can sometimes be found working as fixers in the criminal underworld; how much are you willing to pay for the knowledge you seek?": "除了神秘的知识之外，影子牧师还经常知道一些他们根本不应该知道的事情--如果被揭露，会对人们造成伤害的秘密。阴影祭司有时会被发现在黑社会中充当掮客；你愿意为你所寻求的知识付出多少？",
	"Beyond all this, the Shadow is seen as a corrupting force that creates monsters, both figuratively through temptation, and literally—it is said to have created many of the monstrosities that prey on innocents. In turn, many monstrous creatures see the Shadow as their patron.": "除此以外，影子还被视为创造怪物的腐败力量，无论是通过诱惑，还是通过字面意思，据说它创造了许多掠夺无辜者的怪兽。反过来，许多怪物将影子视为他们的守护者。",
	"The Shadow tempts you to perform evil actions and can teach spells no one should know. While the game's rules aren't designed with the idea of forbidden spells that shouldn't be cast, a DM could choose to grant a character one or more additional spells that have dangerous or unpleasant side effects every time they're cast. Or the Shadow could grant a spellcaster the ability to increase the power of any spell they know—as if it was cast using a higher-level spell slot—once per long rest, but in doing this, it triggers a negative effect.": "阴影诱惑你进行邪恶的行动，并能教导任何人都不应该知道的法术。虽然游戏规则的设计没有考虑到不应该施展的禁忌法术，但管理员可以选择赋予角色一个或多个额外的法术，这些法术每次施展都会产生危险或不愉快的副作用。或者，影子可以赋予施法者增加他们所知道的任何法术的威力的能力--就像用更高等级的法术槽施法一样--每次长时休息一次，但在这样做时，会触发一个负面效应。",
	"Regardless of what effects you establish, they should illustrate a clear and concrete reason why this magic is forbidden. Someone or something will pay a price every time this magic is used. Consider the following ideas:": "无论你建立什么样的效果，它们都应该说明一个明确而具体的理由，说明为什么这个魔法是被禁止的。每次使用这种魔法时，某人或某物将付出代价。请考虑以下想法。",
	"When you cast the spell, roll a d6. The DM chooses you or one of your allies, either dealing the result as necrotic damage or applying it as a penalty to that creature's next saving throw.": "当你施展这个咒语时，掷一个D6。DM会选择你或你的一个盟友，将结果作为坏死伤害来处理，或将其作为该生物的下一个蓄力动作的惩罚。",
	"When you cast the spell, an innocent creature dies. You have no control over who will suffer and may never know who it is.": "当你施法时，一个无辜的生物会死亡。你无法控制谁会受苦，也可能永远不知道是谁。",
	"When you cast the spell, plants wither and all living creatures within 15 feet of you take one point of necrotic damage.": "当你施法时，植物会枯萎，在你周围15英尺内的所有生物都会受到一点坏死的伤害。",
	"When you cast the spell, choose an ally within sight. That player can reveal a disturbing secret about their character to you. This must be worse than any previous secret they've revealed; if they can't or if they choose not to, the spell fails.": "当你施法时，在视线范围内选择一个盟友。该玩家可以向你透露一个关于他们角色的令人不安的秘密。这个秘密必须比他们之前透露的任何秘密都要糟糕；如果他们不能透露或者他们选择不透露，则咒语失败。",
	"When you cast the spell, the effect of the spell itself is particularly horrifying.": "当你施展法术时，法术本身的效果特别恐怖。",
	"Change, chaos": "变化，混乱",
	"Paladins are rarely champions of the Traveler, though any oath's mechanical features could be used to pursue a life of change.": "圣骑士很少是旅行者的拥护者，尽管任何誓言的机械特征都可以用来追求改变生活。",
	"The Traveler touches the domains of many other Sovereigns. Like Aureon and the Shadow, the Traveler is a source of knowledge. Along with Olladra and the Mockery, it is a patron of those who rely on deception and cunning. Like Onatar and the Fury, it can provide inspiration to the artisan. Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere it agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it's because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you have known. If it helps you deceive, it's because your actions will introduce chaos and crisis—whether into your life or the lives of others. Onatar will teach a swordsmith to make a better sword; the Traveler might show them how to make a bomb, changing the face of warfare. The Traveler isn't here to satisfy your greed or to grant your ambitions. Instead, it will set you on paths you never thought to try. This may sometimes grant you good fortune, but when you call on the Traveler, you're inviting the unexpected into your life.": "旅行者触及许多其他君主的领域。像奥瑞恩和影子一样，旅行者是知识的来源。与奥拉德拉和嘲讽一样，它是那些依靠欺骗和狡猾的人的守护神。就像奥纳塔和怒火，它可以为工匠提供灵感。惧怕旅行者的人和崇尚旅行者的人都同意一件事：无论旅行者给予什么礼物，它们总是会导致混乱。如果旅行者给你知识，那是因为这个启示将迫使你重新评估你所知道的一切。如果它帮助你欺骗，那是因为你的行为会引入混乱和危机--无论是在你的生活中还是在别人的生活中。奥纳塔会教一个剑匠制造更好的剑；旅行者可能会告诉他们如何制造炸弹，改变战争的面貌。旅行者在这里不是为了满足你的贪婪，也不是为了实现你的野心。相反，它将使你走上你从未想过要尝试的道路。这有时可能会给你带来好运，但当你呼唤旅行者时，你就会邀请意外进入你的生活。",
	"One of the more infamous Traveler cults within the Five Nations is hidden within House Cannith. While Onatar is the acknowledged patron of House Cannith, some believe that the Traveler is the source of dramatic inspiration, helping artificers make unforeseen breakthroughs. Those who invoke the Traveler know that its gifts will surely have a cost and could shake the foundations of civilization, but they still yearn for that grand discovery. Many in House Cannith believe that Aaren d'Cannith—the inventor of the warforged—was a Traveler cultist; others assume that the Mourning may have been the work of a Cannith heir following the path of the Traveler.": "五国中比较臭名昭著的旅行者邪教之一就隐藏在坎尼斯家族中。虽然奥纳塔是坎尼斯家族公认的守护神，但有些人认为旅行者是戏剧性灵感的来源，帮助工匠们取得意想不到的突破。那些召唤旅行者的人知道，它的礼物肯定会有代价，并可能动摇文明的基础，但他们仍然渴望那个伟大的发现。坎尼斯家族中的许多人都相信阿伦-坎尼斯（Aaren d'Cannith）--战堡的发明者--是旅行者的崇拜者；其他人则认为，哀悼会可能是坎尼斯的一个继承人按照旅行者的路线所做的。",
	"Some who follow the Traveler are tricksters, causing chaos with no clear agenda. But others see themselves as guides, playing tricks on people in order to teach them lessons. Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions—not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven't outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers described in chapter 2 fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them. Ultimately, the Traveler will throw your life into chaos—for it's by adapting to this chaos that people grow.": "一些追随旅行者的人是诡计多端的人，在没有明确议程的情况下造成混乱。但也有人把自己看成是向导，在人们身上耍花招，以便给他们上课。引导者寻求挑战既定的传统、法律或制度--不一定是为了破坏它们，而是为了确保它们没有过期。还有一些人是流浪者，接受不断变化的生活。第二章中描述的变身旅行者就属于这一类，他们相信只要他们保持运动状态，旅行者就会引导和保护他们。最终，旅行者会让你的生活陷入混乱，因为人们正是通过适应这种混乱而成长。",

But no member of such an organization would call themselves a \"cultist of the Dragon Below.\" As a true believer, you might be a blessed eye of the All-Seer, a pilgrim on the road to the Inner Sun, or a warlock in the court of the Queen of Shadows. If you're a member of one of these three cults, you don't see the other two as allies, for they're clearly dangerous and delusional. And while outsiders may be able to guess what force is behind the cult—it doesn't take a Korranberg sage to guess that the people growing eyes on their hands might be tied to Belashyrra—only a fraction of the cults of the Dragon Below knowingly serve a daelkyr or overlord.": "\"下面的龙的崇拜 \"这一称号是一个笼统的术语，用来描述任何为邪恶力量服务或具有违背理性思维的怪异信仰的教派。但这样一个组织的成员都不会自称是 \"下面的龙的崇拜者\"。作为一个真正的信徒，你可能是万物之灵的祝福之眼，是通往内阳之路的朝圣者，或者是影后宫中的术士。如果你是这三个邪教中的一个，你就不会把其他两个看作是盟友，因为他们显然是危险和妄想的。虽然外人也许能猜到邪教背后的力量--不需要科兰伯格的圣人也能猜到，那些手上长着眼睛的人可能与贝拉希拉有关系--但只有一小部分龙之谷的邪教知道为daelkyr或霸主服务。",

And he produces revenants, innocents who wake up convinced they are reincarnated soldiers with a duty to complete unfinished battles. This is common—most overlords and daelkyr have multiple cults, each completely unaware of another. While each cult is unique, most fall into one of the following three categories.": "{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的野蛮人部落吵着要以他的名义在恶魔荒原洒下鲜血。他在五国的忠臣巧妙地散布仇恨和无知。他还制造复仇者，那些醒来后确信自己是转世的士兵，有责任完成未完成的战斗的无辜者。这种情况很常见--大多数霸主和达伊尔克尔都有多个邪教，每个邪教都完全不知道另一个。虽然每个邪教都很独特，但大多数都属于以下三类之一。",
	"Members of these cults are united by shared delusions, the reality of their minds corrupted by a horrifying alien force. Sometimes the delusion infects those who take part in the rituals; other times the ideas first leak into people's minds, then draw them to the cult. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below can never be wiped out, and why they can appear anywhere—you never know when or where an irrational idea can take root, twisting the thoughts and beliefs of innocent people.": "这些邪教成员因共同的妄想而结合在一起，他们头脑中的现实被一种可怕的外来力量所腐蚀。有时，这种妄想会感染那些参加仪式的人；其他时候，这些想法首先渗入人们的头脑，然后吸引他们加入邪教。这就是为什么 \"地下之龙 \"的邪教永远无法被消灭，也是为什么它们可以出现在任何地方--你永远不知道一个非理性的想法何时何地可以扎根，扭曲无辜者的思想和信仰。",
	"While a corrupted cult's beliefs and actions may seem irrational to outsiders, to members of the cult they make perfect sense. A revenant truly believes they are a legendary hero reincarnated. A Vigilant Eye cultist believes they've been given blessed vision that reveals evildoers who must die. The fact the cultist has grown a new eye doesn't seem strange to them—{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.} Corrupted cultists may see the world differently than people around them. A group of revenants could be working with a mind flayer and dolgrims, but they see these aberrations as loyal knights tied to their ancient order. When encountering a corrupted cult, player characters will face the challenge of making sense of the delusion—understanding what the cult members believe they're trying to accomplish, and how it relates to what they're actually doing. These delusions have nothing to do with mental illness and cannot be treated at a Jorasco healing house. This is a form of supernatural influence with a specific cause—a corrupting alien entity—and with a specific effect; corruption can take hold of anyone at any time, and cultists may otherwise appear perfectly healthy and sane.": "虽然在外人看来，一个堕落的邪教的信仰和行为可能是不合理的，但对邪教成员来说，它们是完全合理的。一个复仇者真正相信他们是传奇英雄的转世。一个警戒之眼的邪教成员相信他们得到了受祝福的视野，揭示了必须死亡的恶人。邪教徒长出了一只新的眼睛，这对他们来说并不奇怪--{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.}被腐蚀的邪教徒看到的世界可能与他们周围的人不同。一群复仇者可能正在与一个精神分裂者和dolgrims合作，但他们把这些反常者看作是与他们的古老秩序相联系的忠诚骑士。当遇到一个腐化的邪教时，玩家角色将面临的挑战是如何理解这种错觉--理解邪教成员认为他们要完成的任务，以及它与他们实际所做的事情之间的关系。这些妄想与精神疾病无关，不能在Jorasco疗养院治疗。这是一种超自然的影响，有特定的原因--腐败的外星实体--并有特定的效果；腐败可以在任何时候影响到任何人，而邪教成员可能在其他方面显得非常健康和理智。",
	"Corrupted cults rarely last long. They typically come into existence with a clear purpose, a specific scheme that somehow benefits their guiding power. After this scheme succeeds or fails, the driving force often abandons the survivors. The question is whether this releases cultists from the delusion, or whether they are simply abandoned—or even driven toward destructive acts. A second important question is whether it's possible to free a cultist from their delusion while the cult is still active. This could require magic, such as {@spell greater restoration}. But it could simply require the cultist to be isolated from their allies and deprogrammed, or perhaps separated from an item that is reinforcing the delusion. If this powerful delusion can be broken, perhaps the cultist's original identity can reassert itself.": "腐败的邪教很少持续很长时间。他们通常有一个明确的目的，一个特定的计划，以某种方式使他们的指导力量受益。在这个计划成功或失败后，驱动力往往会抛弃幸存者。问题是，这是否将邪教人员从妄想中释放出来，或者他们是否只是被抛弃，或者甚至被驱使去做破坏性的行为。第二个重要的问题是，在邪教仍然活跃的情况下，是否有可能将邪教人员从他们的妄想中释放出来。这可能需要魔法，比如（%0%）。但也可能只需要将邪教者与他们的盟友隔离开来，并对其进行解除编程，或者也许与加强妄想的物品分开。如果这个强大的错觉可以被打破，也许邪教者的原始身份可以重新得到确认。",
	"The power behind a corrupted cult isn't always obvious. Loyalists know the power they serve and often proudly proclaim it, but many other corrupted cults aren't aware of the power behind them. Vigilant Eye cultists could mistakenly believe that their blessed eyes are a gift from Aureon, while a revenant might believe Dol Arrah has returned them to the world. Even if the cultists themselves don't realize who they serve, the trappings can be a giveaway. Belashyrra's cultists often deal with eyes or beholders, Dyrrn employs illithids and doppelgangers, and Kyrzin's cults usually have something to do with oozes and slime. But sometimes a cult can appear perfectly innocent. Are you absolutely certain that revenant {@i wasn't} restored by Dol Arrah?": "腐败的邪教背后的力量并不总是很明显。忠诚者知道他们所服务的力量，并经常自豪地宣扬它，但许多其他被腐蚀的邪教并不清楚他们背后的力量。警惕之眼的邪教徒可能误以为他们被祝福的眼睛是奥瑞恩的礼物，而复仇者可能认为多尔-阿拉赫把他们还给了世界。即使邪教徒们自己没有意识到他们为谁服务，但他们的外衣也会让人看出来。Belashyrra的邪教徒经常与眼睛或持灵者打交道，Dyrrn雇佣了illithids和二重身，而Kyrzin的邪教徒通常与渗出物和粘液有关。但有时一个邪教可以显得非常无辜。你完全确定那个复仇者（%0%）是由多尔-亚拉恢复的吗？",
	"There are cults far older than any human civilization. Their strongholds are in desolate regions—the Demon Wastes, the Shadow Marches—but immigrants have carried these beliefs into the Five Nations. The members of these cults have been raised to believe that the traditions of their faith are normal. {@i You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.}": "有一些邪教比任何人类文明都要古老。他们的据点在荒凉的地区--恶魔荒原、阴影地带--但移民将这些信仰带到了五国。这些邪教的成员被培养成相信他们信仰的传统是正常的。{@i You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.}",
	"Traditional cultists are typically less volatile and extreme than corrupted cultists; surviving long enough to become a tradition means avoiding reckless behavior and learning to keep your faith hidden from strangers. Many traditional cults can seem harmless; for the most part, Whisperers have no interest in harming or interacting with outsiders. However, traditional cults provide a lurking support network that can be activated when needed. {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} has loyalists hidden throughout the armies of the Five Nations, always ready to escalate violent situations. And a town could be filled with followers of the Transcendent Flesh who appear completely harmless and mundane—until the Night of Six Moons, when they all attach their symbionts and tear apart any outsiders unlucky enough to be in the town that night.": "传统的邪教徒通常没有腐败的邪教徒那么动荡和极端；生存足够长的时间，成为一个传统意味着要避免鲁莽的行为，并学会对陌生人隐藏自己的信仰。许多传统邪教看起来无害；在大多数情况下，低语者对伤害或与外人交往没有兴趣。然而，传统邪教提供了一个潜伏的支持网络，可以在需要时启动。{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的忠诚者隐藏在五国的军队中，随时准备升级暴力局势。而一个城镇可能充满了超凡肉体的追随者，他们看起来完全无害，很平凡--直到 \"六个月亮之夜\"，他们都附着他们的共生体，撕碎任何有幸在那晚出现在城镇的外来者。",
	"Traditional cults are less extreme than corrupted ones, but they still see the world through a strange lens, despite knowing the power they're bound to. Some traditional cults believe their patrons are simply misunderstood—{@i Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!} Others celebrate the destructive or chaotic aspects of their patrons, either believing that this corrupt world deserves to be torn down, or that the faithful will be elevated in the next age. Even a cultist who reveres {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} may not be evil; they could believe the corrupt world must be washed in blood to cleanse evil, and aside from their duties to the Orphan King, they may be gentle and altruistic.": "传统的邪教没有腐败的邪教那么极端，但他们仍然通过一个奇怪的镜头来看待这个世界，尽管他们知道自己被束缚的力量。一些传统的邪教相信他们的守护者只是被误解了--{@i Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!}其他的则是庆祝他们的守护者的破坏性或混乱的一面，要么相信这个腐败的世界应该被拆毁，要么相信信徒们会在下一个时代得到提升。即使是崇尚{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的邪教徒也不一定是邪恶的；他们可能相信这个腐败的世界必须用血来洗净邪恶，除了对孤儿王的职责外，他们可能是温和的、利他的。",
	"The dark powers associated with the cults of the Dragon Below have much to offer. They can imbue their servants with mystical powers, following the model of the warlock. Daelkyr can provide symbionts and physical transformation, while the Lords of Dust can provide wealth, influence, or ancient artifacts to their loyal agents. As a result, transactional cults often begin as secret societies. People join of their own free will, eager to obtain whatever it is the cult has to offer. But even if someone joins for the most rational of reasons, the influence of a daelkyr or an overlord is difficult to resist; the longer someone remains in the cult, the more power it will have over them.": "与 \"下面的龙 \"邪教有关的黑暗力量有很多东西可以提供。他们可以按照术士的模式，给他们的仆人灌输神秘的力量。戴尔克尔（Daelkyr）可以提供共生体和身体改造，而尘土领主（Lords of Dust）可以为他们忠诚的代理人提供财富、影响力或古代文物。因此，交易型邪教往往以秘密社团的形式开始。人们按照自己的意愿加入，渴望获得邪教提供的任何东西。但是，即使有人出于最理性的原因加入，也很难抵制daelkyr或霸主的影响；某人在邪教中呆得越久，邪教对他们的权力就越大。",
	"Consider the Court of Shadows cult, tied to {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}. A wizard has a fascinating conversation with a colleague, discussing a spell unlike anything they've seen before. The colleague explains that the spell is from Ashtakala's vaults, and if the wizard joins the Court, they'll discover many amazing things about magic and history. So they go to a meeting and are impressed by the scholars and warlocks they meet. Soon they're initiated into the cult, swearing an oath to the Queen of Shadows and being invested as the Knight of the Forgotten Library. It seems like a game, and they're gaining access to fascinating new spells. But as time passes, they become ever more obsessed with rising in the Court of Shadows. The political interplay in the Kingdom of Shadows feels more real, more relevant than the mundane politics of Khorvaire. They pursue missions for the Queen, yearning to win her favor. And they hope that someday the Queen will rise from her slumber, for then, the Kingdom of Shadows will truly become real.": "考虑到影子法庭的邪教，与（%0%）挂钩。一个巫师与一个同事进行了一次精彩的对话，讨论了一个与他们之前见过的不同的咒语。同事解释说，这个咒语来自阿什塔卡拉的金库，如果巫师加入法庭，他们会发现许多关于魔法和历史的神奇之处。于是他们去参加了一个会议，并被他们遇到的学者和术士们所打动。很快，他们就被引入了邪教，向影后宣誓，并被授予被遗忘图书馆骑士的称号。这似乎是一场游戏，他们获得了迷人的新法术。但随着时间的推移，他们变得越来越痴迷于在阴影法庭中崛起。阴影王国的政治互动感觉更真实，比霍尔韦尔的世俗政治更有意义。他们为女王追求任务，渴望赢得她的青睐。他们希望有一天女王会从她的沉睡中醒来，因为那时，阴影王国将真正成为现实。",
	"Transactional cults can be found anywhere on this slippery slope. A transactional cult might use symbiont weapons but otherwise be quite rational. Or, while you can still see how they stumbled into this mess, they could be completely pulled into the warped reality espoused by the cult.": "交易型邪教可以在这个滑坡的任何地方找到。一个交易型邪教可能使用共生体武器，但在其他方面却相当理性。或者，虽然你仍然可以看到他们是如何跌入这个烂摊子的，但他们可能完全被拉入邪教所主张的扭曲的现实。",
	"Transactional cults are typically small, but can be widespread. A coven of the Court of Shadows may only have a few members, but the Court itself is spread across Khorvaire. Often, members of transactional cults know who they are dealing with, but greed or curiosity overrides concerns. However, it's also possible for people to only know part of the story; a warlock might believe that the Queen of Shadows is a mighty warlock or perhaps an archfey, not realizing she's actually an overlord.": "交易型邪教通常规模较小，但也可能很普遍。阴影法庭的女巫团可能只有几个成员，但该法庭本身却遍布霍尔韦尔。通常，交易型邪教的成员知道他们在和谁打交道，但贪婪或好奇心压倒了担忧。然而，人们也有可能只知道故事的一部分；一个术士可能认为阴影女王是一个强大的术士，或许是一个大法官，而没有意识到她其实是一个霸主。",
	"What do the cults of the Dragon Below {@i want}? What do members strive to achieve? This varies based on the structure and patron of the cult. All of the malevolent powers described in this section have loyalists, cults that are devoted to releasing their lords from Khyber or helping their agents (be they Lords of Dust, mind flayers, or rogue dragons) with whatever they require. But beyond the loyalists, cult goals can be a little more exotic.": "下面的龙的邪教{@i want}是什么？成员们努力实现的目标是什么？这根据邪教的结构和赞助人而有所不同。本节所描述的所有邪恶势力都有忠诚的信徒，这些邪教致力于将他们的领主从开伯尔释放出来，或者帮助他们的代理人（无论是尘埃领主、心灵传播者，还是流氓龙）满足他们的任何要求。但除了忠诚者之外，邪教的目标可以更奇特一点。",
	"Corrupted cults usually have some sort of immediate goal that drives the formation and expansion of the cult. {@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!} The goals are often terrible things that must be stopped, but it's not always obvious how they are helping the power behind the cult; these schemes may have nothing to do with the seals of the daelkyr or releasing an overlord. In the case of an overlord, the archfiends gain strength by driving mortals down their paths. For {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, getting mortals to use magic for malevolence strengthens her regardless of what they actually do; likewise, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} revels in all violence. Meanwhile, the daelkyr are truly incomprehensible. They certainly enjoy experimenting with their preferred mediums; one of {@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's} cults could enact a ritual that causes dragonmarks to come to life and attack their bearers, with no purpose beyond satisfying Dyrrn's curiosity. As the daelkyr experience time in a nonlinear fashion, it's also possible that what seems like meaningless chaos could have a unforeseen future—that there will come a time when a living dragonmark unleashed in the cult's bizarre rampage ends up being the vital element needed to defeat one of the Lords of Dust. The key point is that cults of the Dragon Below—particularly corrupted cults—may not have long-term plans; their schemes can and should often appear nonsensical.": "腐败的邪教通常有某种直接的目标，促使邪教的形成和扩张。{@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!}这些目标通常是必须被阻止的可怕事情，但它们如何帮助邪教背后的力量并不总是显而易见的；这些计划可能与daelkyr的封印或释放一个霸主毫无关系。在霸主的情况下，大恶魔通过驱使凡人走上他们的道路来获得力量。对于(1%)来说，让凡人使用魔法进行恶意攻击会让她变得更加强大，而不管他们实际做了什么；同样地，(2%)也沉醉于所有的暴力。同时，daelkyr是真正不可理喻的。他们当然喜欢用自己喜欢的媒介进行实验；其中一个{@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's}的教派可以举行仪式，使龙纹活过来并攻击它们的持有者，除了满足Dyrrn的好奇心之外，没有任何目的。由于daelkyr以非线性的方式体验时间，看似毫无意义的混乱也可能有一个不可预知的未来--有一天，邪教的怪异狂欢中释放的活龙印最终成为击败尘土领主之一的关键因素。关键的一点是，下面的龙的邪教--特别是腐败的邪教--可能没有长期的计划；他们的计划可能而且应该经常显得无稽之谈。",
	"Traditional cults are religions. They aren't driven by short term goals, but instead provide guidelines on how to live your whole life. Traditional cults can be peaceful and innocuous... until they aren't. A particular alignment of moons, a vision sent to the cult leader, a critical mass of outsiders arriving at the same time—any cult could have a set of circumstances that trigger bloody rituals or brutal sacrifices. This is where the absurdity of a traditional cult rises to the surface. The people of Lowholt couldn't be kinder—until the flesh barn runs low on spleen and they have to harvest your organs. {@i It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen}—the \"grandparents\" in this case being the gibbering mouther in the basement.": "传统的邪教是宗教。他们不是由短期目标驱动，而是提供如何生活的指导方针。传统的邪教可以是和平的、无害的......直到他们不是这样。一个特定的月亮排列，一个发送给邪教领袖的幻象，大量的外来者在同一时间到达，任何邪教都可能有一系列的情况，引发血腥的仪式或残酷的牺牲。这就是传统邪教的荒谬之处。洛霍特的人再仁慈不过了--直到肉仓里的脾脏不够用了，他们不得不收割你的器官。{@i It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen}--在这种情况下，\"祖父母 \"就是地下室里那个胡言乱语的人。",
	"Transactional cults are often initially driven by the desires of the members. Someone joins a transactional cult because they want the power to do something—to take revenge on their enemies, to overthrow a tyrant, to destroy a local criminal gang. But the patron always has a price, and this can eventually follow the same model described for corrupted cults earlier.": "交易型邪教最初往往是由成员的欲望驱动的。有人加入交易型邪教是因为他们希望有能力去做一些事情--向敌人复仇，推翻暴君，摧毁当地犯罪团伙。但赞助人总是有代价的，这最终会遵循前面描述的腐败邪教的相同模式。",
	"Each cult of the Dragon Below is tied to a sinister power trapped in Khyber, and a cult's goals usually reflect the power behind it. If the cult has inhuman allies, are they fiends, aberrations, or other monsters? What sort of treasures and magic items does the group use? These magic items aren't necessarily direct gifts from the patron; a cult of Kyrzin may have many potions because the high priest is an alchemist, or because a strange fountain in the temple secretes mystical fluids. In the case of loyalists and traditional cults, the connection to its patron may be quite obvious, whereas corrupted cults can be challenging to identify the hidden manipulator. Regardless of whether cultists know the identity of their patron, the power behind a cult has many effects.": "每一个 \"下面的龙 \"邪教都与困在开伯尔的邪恶力量有关，而一个邪教的目标通常反映了它背后的力量。如果该邪教有非人的盟友，他们是恶魔、反常者还是其他怪物？该团体使用什么样的宝物和魔法物品？这些魔法物品不一定是赞助人的直接礼物；一个Kyrzin教派可能有很多药水，因为大祭司是个炼金术士，或者因为神庙里的一个奇怪的喷泉会分泌神秘的液体。在忠诚者和传统邪教的情况下，与其守护者的联系可能相当明显，而腐败的邪教则很难识别隐藏的操纵者。不管邪教信徒是否知道其赞助人的身份，邪教背后的力量有很多影响。",
	"As a broad rule, cults tied to overlords (Rak Tulkhesh, Sul Khatesh, Katashka, Bel Shalor, the Daughter of Khyber) are either directly helping the Lords of Dust or trying to drive behavior that strengthens the archfiend. The daelkyr (Belashyrra, Dyrrn, Kyrzin, Orlaask, Valaara) are more enigmatic. Their traditional cults may continue strange patterns of behavior handed down for generations, performing sacrifices or mysterious rituals when the planes are aligned. But they can also engage in dramatic actions with no clear benefit to anyone. There's no clear reason for Orlassk to turn citizens of Sharn into gargoyles; it could be an experiment, or simply a form of art. But these actions will be related to the sphere of the daelkyr that causes it, whether that's oozes, stone, eyes, or insects.": "一般来说，与霸主（拉克-图尔克什、苏尔-凯特什、卡塔什卡、贝尔-沙洛尔、凯伯之女）相联系的邪教要么直接帮助尘土领主，要么试图推动加强大火球的行为。daelkyr（Belashyrra、Dyrrn、Kyrzin、Orlaask、Valaara）则更加神秘莫测。他们的传统邪教可能会延续世代相传的奇怪行为模式，在星球排列整齐时进行祭祀或神秘的仪式。但他们也可以从事戏剧性的行动，对任何人都没有明确的好处。奥拉斯克把沙恩的公民变成石像鬼并没有明确的理由；这可能是一个实验，或者只是一种艺术形式。但这些行动会与引起它的daelkyr的范畴有关，不管那是ozes、石头、眼睛还是昆虫。",
	"The ten powers described below reflect the most common cults, but there are many other overlords and daelkyr. There will never be a complete list, and DMs can always develop new powers. Use these as inspiration, but don't feel limited.": "下面描述的十种力量反映了最常见的邪教，但还有许多其他的霸主和daelkyr。永远不会有一个完整的清单，而且DM可以随时开发新的权力。用这些作为灵感，但不要觉得有什么限制。",
	"The brightest soul casts the longest shadow. You can't escape the evil within you. It's always one step behind, waiting for you to miss a step. Even if you keep your footing, do you truly believe that those around you are as strong as you? Are they so virtuous?

	"The overlords embody mortal fears, and Bel Shalor embodies our fear of {@i other mortals}—the eternal suspicion that a stranger means us harm, that even our friends can't be trusted. Bel Shalor thrives on paranoia and feasts when fear drives good people to do terrible things. Wars feed Rak Tulkhesh, but an inquisition that torments countless innocents delights Bel Shalor—especially when carried out by virtuous people. In the third century YK, Bel Shalor nearly escaped his bonds before being bound once more by the sacrifice of Tira Miron, but some sages wonder if Bel Shalor didn't in fact {@i allow} himself to be defeated. Now he is forever tied to Tira, and anyone who can hear the Voice of the Silver Flame can also hear the tempting whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.": "霸主体现了凡人的恐惧，而贝尔-沙洛体现了我们对（%0%）的恐惧--永远怀疑一个陌生人会对我们造成伤害，甚至我们的朋友也不可信。贝尔-沙勒以偏执狂为生，当恐惧驱使好人做出可怕的事情时，他就会大吃一惊。战争为Rak Tulkhesh提供食物，但折磨无数无辜者的宗教裁判所却让Bel Shalor感到高兴--特别是当由有德行的人执行时。在YK第三世纪，贝尔-夏洛尔几乎逃脱了他的束缚，然后被提拉-米隆的牺牲再次束缚，但一些圣人怀疑贝尔-夏洛尔是否事实上{@i allow}自己被打败了。现在他永远被绑在提拉身上，任何能听到银色火焰之声的人也能听到火焰中阴影的诱人低语。",
	"Bel Shalor doesn't encourage savage violence. Instead, he amplifies fears and suspicions while fanning the fires of greed and self-interest. He convinces us that the people around us are cruel and petty; the only way to survive is to strike first, to take what we need regardless of the cost to others.": "贝尔-沙洛尔并不鼓励野蛮的暴力。相反，他放大了恐惧和怀疑，同时煽起了贪婪和私利的火焰。他让我们相信，我们周围的人都是残忍和小气的；唯一的生存方式就是先下手为强，不顾他人的损失，拿走我们需要的东西。",
	"Corrupted cults can appear anywhere; Bel Shalor seizes on a suspicion and amplifies it. The Whispering Flame is a transactional cult hidden within the Church of the Silver Flame—a secret order of priests and templars who do Bel Shalor's bidding in exchange for power and influence. The greatest agents of the Whispering Flame rarely perform obvious acts of corruption themselves; instead, they subtly encourage others to compromise their principles or succumb to their fears.": "腐败的邪教可以出现在任何地方；贝尔-沙洛抓住了一个疑点并将其放大。低语之焰是一个隐藏在银焰教会中的交易性邪教--一个由牧师和圣殿骑士组成的秘密组织，他们听从贝尔-沙洛的命令，以换取权力和影响力。低语之焰最伟大的代理人很少自己进行明显的腐败行为；相反，他们巧妙地鼓励其他人妥协他们的原则或屈服于他们的恐惧。",
	"Bel Shalor's chief agents are {@creature rakshasa}, and his {@i prakhutu} (\"speaker\") on the Council of Ashtakala is known as the Wyrmbreaker.

	"Magic items associated with Bel Shalor typically are used to manipulate others, conceal thoughts, or control shadows.

	"Bel Shalor thrives on manipulating thoughts and emotions.

	"Any fear could be amplified by Bel Shalor and form the basis of a cult. A group of people in a small town might become convinced that there's a {@creature doppelganger} or a {@creature wererat} hidden in the community that has to be rooted out at any cost. Or perhaps it's a fear of foreign spies. Or warforged made to replace humans... can you prove that you're not a warforged imposter? Frequently such cults truly believe that they're protecting the innocent from a serious threat, and don't realize that they are the ones serving a dark power.": "任何恐惧都可能被贝尔-沙洛放大，形成邪教的基础。小镇上的一群人可能会相信，社区里隐藏着一个{@creature doppelganger}或一个{@creature wererat}，必须不惜一切代价将其铲除。也可能是对外国间谍的恐惧。或者是为了取代人类而制造的战神......你能证明你不是一个战神的冒牌货吗？经常有这样的邪教组织真正相信他们在保护无辜者免受严重的威胁，而没有意识到他们是为黑暗势力服务的人。",

Belashyrra's cultists can become obsessed with sight, both unable to believe what they can't see, and utterly convinced of those things they can. They might experience visions others can't see, or gain powers linked with sight, like a beholder's eye rays. The concept of seeing secret things is critical for these cults and typically drives their missions. It's common for devoted cultists of Belashyrra to grow new eyes, as with the Vigilant Eye cult.": "达尔凯尔（%0%）与视觉有关，并可能利用其崇拜者作为探索世界的容器。Belashyrra的崇拜者会对视觉着迷，既无法相信他们看不到的东西，又完全相信他们能看到的东西。他们可能会体验到别人看不到的幻象，或者获得与视觉相关的力量，比如观察者的眼睛射线。看到秘密事物的概念对这些邪教来说至关重要，通常会推动他们的任务。贝拉希拉的忠实崇拜者长出新眼睛是很常见的，就像警戒之眼邪教一样。",
	"Belashyrra has traditional cults in the Shadow Marches; members generally keep to themselves, unless guided by visions or gathering sacrifices. Belashyrra's corrupted cults can appear anywhere, driven by ecstatic visions or convinced that only they can see threats that must be dealt with (such as members of the Vigilant Eye believing they can see hidden demons). Belashyrra's cultists aren't always dangerous; they can be gifted oracles, and sometimes they truly can see threats hidden from others. Belashyrra is also known to be fighting the Umbragen drow beneath Xen'drik.": "Belashyrra在阴影地带有传统的邪教；除非有幻觉的指引或收集祭品，否则成员一般都保持自我。Belashyrra的堕落邪教可以出现在任何地方，他们被狂喜的幻觉所驱使，或者相信只有他们能看到必须处理的威胁（比如警戒之眼的成员相信他们能看到隐藏的恶魔）。Belashyrra的崇拜者并不总是危险的；他们可能是有天赋的神谕者，有时他们真的能看到别人看不到的威胁。众所周知，贝拉希拉也在与Xen'drik下面的Umbragen乌鸦作战。",
	"Belashyrra is the source of beholderkin in Eberron, though they can be found serving other daelkyr or operating independently. Any aberration whose powers revolve around eyes or vision could be tied to Belashyrra.

Symbiont items that grant sight-related abilities will often demand to see certain things; the wearer will simply have a sense that the robe wants to see what's inside that building, and refusing such requests could result in losing the powers of the item until a long or short rest has been completed. In addition to items, Belashyrra can grant supernatural gifts tied to sight, such as granting darkvision or the ability to use {@spell true seeing} once a week; such gifts usually take the form of a new eye manifesting on the victim, with the power only working through that eye.": "任何与视觉有关的魔法物品都可以与贝拉希拉联系在一起，通常以共生体的形式。崇拜者可以拥有有机版的（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）；（%3%）可以由皮革材料制成，与佩戴者的身体结合在一起。赋予视觉相关能力的共生物品往往会要求看到某些东西；穿戴者会简单地感觉到长袍想看看那个建筑里面有什么，拒绝这种要求可能会导致失去物品的能力，直到完成长时间或短时间的休息。除了物品之外，贝拉希拉还可以授予与视力有关的超自然礼物，例如授予暗视或每周使用一次（4%）的能力；这种礼物通常采取在受害者身上显现出一只新眼睛的形式，力量只通过这只眼睛起作用。",
	"Belashyrra can be an excellent patron for a {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} warlock, because typically what it asks of its warlocks is to see things; a warlock will be charged to find something or observe a particular event. Sight-related invocations are common, and spell effects may be channeled through the eyes—either the warlock's natural eyes, or new ones that they manifest. Any character could be guided by visions shown by Belashyrra; a paladin might not follow a god, but rather be driven by the visions of evil Belashyrra shows them. Is Belashyrra guiding them to stop evil, or is the All-Seer mocking them by showing them the evil people do, while the paladin is determined to prevent these visions from coming to pass?": "Belashyrra是一个优秀的{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}术士的守护者，因为它对术士的要求通常是看到东西；一个术士会被要求找到一些东西或观察一个特定的事件。与视觉有关的召唤很常见，法术效果可以通过眼睛来引导--无论是术士的天然眼睛，还是他们所显现的新眼睛。任何角色都可以被贝拉希拉展示的幻象所引导；一个圣骑士可能不会追随一个神，而是被贝拉希拉展示的邪恶幻象所驱动。Belashyrra是在引导他们阻止邪恶，还是全能神通过向他们展示人们所做的邪恶来嘲弄他们，而圣骑士则决心阻止这些幻象的发生？",
	"Due to a cult's actions, people start seeing hidden truths they don't want to know. A wave of visual hallucinations is causing people to see their friends as monsters or deadly enemies. A serial killer is collecting eyes of different species to offer to the All-Seer. A loyalist cult sees signs that reveal one of the adventurers is their next designated sacrifice. An individual or group (such as the Vigilant Eye) is guided by visions leading them to murder hidden demons—are they killing innocents, or could there truly be demons hidden in the community?": "由于邪教的行为，人们开始看到他们不想知道的隐藏真相。一波视觉幻觉使人们把自己的朋友看成怪物或致命的敌人。一个连环杀手正在收集不同物种的眼睛，以提供给全能者。一个忠诚的邪教组织看到了一些迹象，显示其中一个冒险者是他们的下一个指定牺牲品。一个人或团体（如警戒之眼）被幻觉引导着去谋杀隐藏的恶魔--他们是在杀害无辜者，还是真的有恶魔隐藏在社区中？",

	"Of all the cults, this is the one that most truly serves the Dragon Below. Loyalists serve the Daughter of Khyber as the greatest champion of her mother and the harbinger of Khyber's return. Loyalist doctrine maintains that Khyber didn't betray Siberys; instead, she was the one betrayed. Khyber had a grand and glorious vision for reality, but the other Progenitors turned on her. Cultists typically see themselves as being oppressed by laws and systems; like Khyber, they are imprisoned by their inferiors, by people who don't understand their vision for the world, and they will ascend to glory when Khyber rises. Some cults maintain that dragons themselves were the creations of Khyber and were stolen by Siberys and Eberron; under this belief, the Daughter isn't corrupting dragons, but rather restoring them to their rightful role. In any case, loyalists see themselves as warriors in a battle to restore proper balance to reality, heroes who will be elevated in the dark and beautiful reality soon to be revealed through dragonfire and blood.": "在所有的教派中，这是一个最真正服务于下面的龙的教派。忠诚派将开伯尔之女奉为她母亲最伟大的冠军和开伯尔回归的预兆。忠诚派的学说认为，开伯尔并没有背叛西伯利亚，相反，她才是被背叛的人。凯贝尔对现实有一个宏伟而光荣的愿景，但其他祖先却背叛了她。邪教信徒通常认为自己受到法律和制度的压迫；像开伯尔一样，他们被下级囚禁，被那些不理解他们对世界的愿景的人囚禁，当开伯尔崛起时，他们将升入荣耀。一些邪教坚持认为，龙本身就是开伯尔的创造物，被西伯利亚和艾伯伦偷走了；在这种信念下，女儿不是在腐蚀龙，而是将它们恢复到它们应有的角色。在任何情况下，效忠者都把自己看作是为恢复现实的适当平衡而战斗的勇士，他们将在即将通过龙火和鲜血揭示的黑暗而美丽的现实中得到升华的英雄。",
	"Corrupted cultists may share these beliefs. Other common delusions include the idea that cultists are dragons—either transformed and trapped in human form, or inheritors of draconic bloodlines who could someday regain their proper form.

However, there are other cults—such as the Transcendent Flesh—who see Dyrrn's actions in a positive light. Dyrrn transforms and creates new forms of life—but who are we to decide that these things are monsters? Such cultists believe that Dyrrn is driving evolution, and they can transcend their own limits by walking the path of the Foul Labyrinth. While this can start as simply transactional, the influence of the Corruptor is insidious, and cultists can soon start to see natural creatures as vile and weak.": "Dyrrn的效忠者认为，腐蚀者最终会吞噬和改造世界，只有那些为它服务的人才能活下来。然而，也有其他邪教--如超凡肉体--从积极的角度看待Dyrrn的行为。Dyrrn改造并创造了新的生命形式，但我们有什么资格决定这些东西是怪物？这类崇拜者认为，Dyrrn正在推动进化，他们可以通过走 \"污秽迷宫 \"的道路来超越自己的极限。虽然这开始只是简单的交易，但腐蚀者的影响是阴险的，邪教徒很快就会开始将自然生物视为卑鄙和软弱。",
	"Dyrrn has had a long presence in western Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, and the Wardens of the Wood remain ever watchful for its vile creations.

	"Katashka thrives both on the fear of death and fear of the undead. As such, his cults might spread plagues or otherwise cause mass death, or they might unleash ghouls in the sewers or trigger zombie outbreaks. His intent is not death itself—the Grim King draws strength from the {@i fear} of the living. As such, Katashka rarely seeks to kill people swiftly. The primary purpose of the lingering plague is to sow fear among those fighting it, and the small pack of ghouls that causes long-term terror is more effective than an army that wipes out a city in a day. Likewise, Katashka's undead champions revel in their unnatural condition; they want people to know what they are and to fear them.": "卡塔什卡在对死亡的恐惧和对亡灵的恐惧上都很兴旺。因此，他的邪教可能会传播瘟疫或以其他方式造成大规模死亡，也可能在下水道中释放食尸鬼或引发僵尸爆发。他的目的不是死亡本身--狰狞之王从活人的（%0%）中汲取力量。因此，卡塔什卡很少寻求迅速地杀人。挥之不去的瘟疫的主要目的是在与之斗争的人中散播恐惧，而造成长期恐怖的小群食尸鬼比在一天内消灭一座城市的军队更有效。同样，卡塔什卡的亡灵冠军们也陶醉于他们的非自然状态；他们希望人们知道他们是什么，并害怕他们。",
	"The Gatekeeper's cults are often transactional, with cultists serving the Grim King in exchange for secrets of necromancy or undead servants. Corrupted cults will in some way tie to death or the undead; Katashka also produces revenants. Katashka's cults have no established territories, but are actually rarer in Karrnath than elsewhere in the Five Nations, as the Blood of Vol presents a different path to necromantic magic along with a more positive overall message for followers.": "守门人的邪教往往是交易性的，邪教徒为狰狞之王服务，以换取亡灵法术的秘密或不死的仆人。腐败的邪教会以某种方式与死亡或亡灵挂钩；卡塔什卡也生产复仇者。卡塔什卡的邪教没有既定的领土，但实际上在卡尔纳特比五国的其他地方更少见，因为沃尔之血为追随者提供了一条不同的死灵魔法之路，以及更积极的整体信息。",
	"There are some obvious similarities between Katashka and the Keeper, and some scholars assert that they are one and the same—that Katashka's actions in the Age of Demons inspired the myths of the Keeper.

In contrast, priests of the Keeper also deal with general greed, offering deals that have nothing to do with death or undeath.": "卡塔什卡和守护者之间有一些明显的相似之处，一些学者断言他们是同一个人--卡塔什卡在恶魔时代的行为启发了守护者的神话。一个关键的区别是卡塔什卡对不死之身的关注，在某些方面类似于其他环境中奥库斯的角色。相比之下，守护者的祭司也处理一般的贪婪，提供与死亡或不死之身无关的交易。",

Beyond this, the greatest gift Katashka grants his followers is life after death. A champion of Katashka could be repeatedly raised after death, forcing adventurers to find more elaborate ways to prevent their resurrection. His champions could also be returned as undead; only valuable servants are granted a second life as liches or vampires, but lesser cultists could rise after death as zombies or ghouls—an unpleasant surprise for adventurers fighting them!": "卡塔什卡的宝物是消耗生命的工具，比如说（%0%）。他的崇拜者也可能拥有创造或指挥亡灵的工具。除此之外，卡塔什卡给予其追随者的最大礼物是死后的生命。卡塔什卡的冠军可以在死后反复复活，迫使冒险者找到更多的方法来阻止他们复活。他的冠军也可以作为亡灵返回；只有有价值的仆人才会被赋予作为地衣或吸血鬼的第二次生命，但较低级的邪教徒死后可以作为僵尸或食尸鬼复活--这对与他们战斗的冒险者来说是个不愉快的惊喜",

	"Any plotline involving evil undead or power-hungry necromancers can be laid at Katashka's feet; his cults require less nuance than the Blood of Vol. A common theme is the fact that Katashka doesn't simply want to kill innocents, he wants people to fear death and the undead.": "任何涉及邪恶的亡灵或渴望权力的死灵法师的情节都可以放在卡塔什卡的脚下；他的邪教需要的细微差别没有沃尔之血那么大。 一个共同的主题是，卡塔什卡不只是想杀死无辜者，他想让人们恐惧死亡和亡灵。",

It is infamous as the source of all oozes; some believe that there are living rivers of gray ooze and green slime in the depths of Khyber. Many cults revere gibbering mouthers and hear guiding words in the ravings of these beasts; such cults refer to Kyrzin as the Regent of Whispers. While oozes play a major role, its cults can be associated with liquid in any form. One cult might venerate an ancient well, while others say that the local lake holds the ghosts of their ancestors.

While many Marchers know stories of the Prince of Slime, it's typically seen as a dangerous but largely neutral force. Mold plays an important part in Marcher medicine, and the Bile Lord is seen as a force that can cause disease when angered, or help to prevent it. So most prefer to ignore and avoid Kyrzin, and Whisperers are largely left alone.": "Kyrzin的传统邪教在阴影地带得到了牢固的确立，但Whisperers则保持自我。游行者将普通的感冒称为 \"滴水 \"或 \"胆汁领主之吻\"；还有故事说，Kyrzin在牧场的河流中播下了巨大的渗水。虽然许多行军者知道粘液王子的故事，但它通常被视为一种危险但基本中立的力量。霉菌在行军者的医学中扮演着重要的角色，而胆汁领主被视为一种力量，在被激怒时可以导致疾病，或者帮助预防疾病。因此，大多数人宁愿忽略和避免Kyrzin，而低语者基本上不受影响。",
	"In Eberron, Kyrzin replaces Juiblex as the source of {@creature black pudding||black puddings}, {@creature gray ooze||gray oozes}, {@creature gibbering mouther||gibbering mouthers}, {@creature mimic||mimics}, and similar creatures, any of which could be tied to the Prince of Slime. It can also create creatures similar to living spells, though Kyrzin is not responsible for the living spells that roam the Mournland. Its most infamous creations are parasitic oozes, a form of black pudding that can enter a creature's body. More intelligent than their larger kin, these oozes can communicate telepathically with their hosts. An adventurer who kills a weak cultist may have an unpleasant surprise when a deadly parasitic ooze emerges from the corpse! Victims unwillingly bonded to a parasitic slime must find a way to coexist until they can be freed from the creature ({@spell greater restoration} will expel it). If angered, the ooze can eat its way out of the victim, which is usually fatal. Kyrzin is also served by {@creature dolgaunt|ERLW|dolgaunts} and {@creature dolgrim|ERLW|dolgrims}; those created by the Prince of Slime have slimy, translucent skin.": "在Eberron，Kyrzin取代了Juiblex成为{@creature black pudding||black puddings}、{@creature gray ooze||gray oozes}、{@creature gibbering mouther||gibbering mouthers}、{@creature mimic||mimics}和类似生物的来源，其中任何一种都可能与粘液王子有关。它还可以创造类似于活体法术的生物，尽管Kyrzin并不负责漫游在哀牢地的活体法术。它最臭名昭著的创造物是寄生性渗出物，一种可以进入生物体内的黑色布丁形式。比起它们较大的亲戚，这些渗虫更有智慧，可以与它们的宿主进行心灵感应。当一个冒险者杀了一个弱小的邪教徒后，可能会有一个不愉快的惊喜，因为从尸体中出现了一个致命的寄生性的渗出物。不愿与寄生黏液结合的受害者必须找到一种共存的方式，直到他们能够从该生物中解脱出来（（4%）会驱逐它）。如果被激怒了，这种黏液可以从受害者体内吃出来，这通常是致命的。Kyrzin也为{@creature dolgaunt|ERLW|dolgaunts}和{@creature dolgrim|ERLW|dolgrims}服务；那些由粘液王子创造的人有粘稠的、半透明的皮肤。",
	"Kyrzin's cults are well stocked with potions. While they may have standard effects, Kyrzin's potions are often disturbing to look at and may crawl about, ooze-like, if spilled. Kyrzin's symbionts often mimic the effects of magical garments, though they are fluid rather than fabric; Kyrzin's {@item cloak of elvenkind} is an amorphous shroud that shifts to match its surroundings.": "柯尔钦的邪教都有充足的药水储备。虽然它们可能有标准的效果，但Kyrzin的药水往往让人看了很不舒服，而且如果洒出来的话，可能会爬来爬去，像渗漏一样。Kyrzin的共生体经常模仿魔法服装的效果，尽管它们是流体而不是织物；Kyrzin的（%0%）是一个无定形的罩子，会随着周围环境的变化而变化。",
	"An artificer from an old Whisperer family could have an unorthodox approach to alchemy, and their homunculus could be a living ooze. A {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} warlock could specialize in spells dealing with fluids or confusing whispers; even {@spell eldritch blast} could be flavored as flinging globs of mystically charged slime.": "一个来自古老的语者家族的工匠可以对炼金术采取非正统的方法，而他们的同体人可以是一个活生生的渗水。一个{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}的术士可以专攻处理液体或混乱的低语的法术；甚至{@spell eldritch blast}的术士也可以被调教成投掷带着神秘色彩的粘液团。",
	"A cult could do something unusual to the water supply of a town, whether introducing poisons or hallucinogens, or transforming the water into living ooze. Kyrzin's parasitic oozes could spread throughout a town or take over a particular organization—but what do they actually want? Friends of the party could be consumed by a gibbering mouther—but could they still be alive within the slime?": "一个邪教组织可以对一个城镇的供水做一些不寻常的事情，无论是引入毒药或致幻剂，还是将水转化为活的渗水。Kyrzin的寄生渗出物可能会蔓延到整个城镇，或接管一个特定的组织--但他们到底想要什么？党的朋友们可能会被胡言乱语的口水虫吞噬，但他们在粘液中还能活着吗？",

So respect the stone, for it'll still be here long after you've turned to dust.": "石头是不朽的。它听着。它记住了。它选择静止，但任何见过夜行神龙的人都知道，只要它选择，它就能移动。所以要尊重石头，因为在你化为尘土之后，它还会在这里很久的。",
	"The daelkyr Orlassk is the master of stone. Orlassk's traditional cults say that it is the Still Lord who carves out caverns, and that it is the Voice in the Stone that guides the miner to the ore. Orlassk can breathe life into stone, as seen in the {@creature gargoyle}; but it can also turn living creatures into stone, and it's thought that most creatures with this power—{@creature medusa||medusas}, {@creature gorgon||gorgons}, {@creature basilisk||basilisks}, {@creature cockatrice||cockatrices}—are its creations. Cults may associate with such creatures, but they can also venerate stone itself. Orlassk's cultists could venerate a sacred stone that whispers when it's fed fresh blood, or maintain a deep chamber where all the secret knowledge of the cult is engraved into the walls.": "daelkyr Orlassk是石头的主人。奥拉斯克的传统崇拜说，是静止的主宰开凿了洞穴，是石头中的声音引导矿工找到了矿石。奥拉斯克可以将生命注入石头，如{@creature gargoyle}；但它也可以将生物变成石头，人们认为大多数具有这种能力的生物--{@creature medusa||medusas}、{@creature gorgon||gorgons}、{@creature basilisk||basilisks}、{@creature cockatrice||cockatrices}--都是它创造的。崇拜者可能会与这种生物联系在一起，但他们也可以崇尚石头本身。奥拉斯克的崇拜者可以崇拜一块神圣的石头，当它被喂食新鲜血液时，它就会发出低语，或者维护一个深邃的密室，将崇拜者的所有秘密知识刻在墙上。",
	"Orlassk is one of the lesser known daelkyr. Its cults are found where people live around stone, in high mountains and deep caves. Orlassk's corrupted cults often form around those who work with stone: masons, sculptors, stone giants, or even just people who dwell in stone towers. When the walls start whispering to you, Orlassk has found you.": "奥拉斯克是较少为人所知的达尔凯尔之一。它的邪教是在人们生活在石头周围的地方，在高山和深山洞穴中发现的。奥拉斯克的堕落邪教往往围绕着那些与石头打交道的人形成：石匠、雕塑家、石头巨人，甚至只是住在石塔里的人。当墙壁开始对你说悄悄话时，奥拉斯克已经找到了你。",
	"Orlassk is thought to have feuds with other daelkyr. Orlassk and Kyrzin are fundamentally opposed: solid against liquid, static against change.

	"Orlassk is tied to creatures of stone, both those made of stone and those that petrify. The {@creature medusa||medusas} of Cazhaak Draal in Droaam deny any connection to Orlassk, but it may have {@creature medusa} cultists elsewhere in Khyber. Orlassk has many {@creature gargoyle} servants in exotic variations. It employs creatively twisted earth elementals. Orlassk's {@creature dolgrim|ERLW} and {@creature dolgaunt|ERLW} minions have a rocky skin texture and can stand still indefinitely.": "奥拉斯克与石头的生物有关，包括那些由石头制成的生物和那些石化的生物。德罗亚姆的卡扎克-德拉尔（%0%）否认与奥拉斯克有任何联系，但它在开伯尔的其他地方可能有（%1%）的崇拜者。奥拉斯克有许多(2%)具有异国情调的仆人。它创造性地使用了扭曲的土元素。奥拉斯克的{@creature dolgrim|ERLW}和{@creature dolgaunt|ERLW}爪牙拥有岩石般的皮肤纹理，可以无限期地站立。",
	"Any form of magic item that is related to stone can be associated with Orlassk.

	"While most of the Orphan King's cults are driven by ruthless aggression, they could also believe they are serving a greater good. A corrupted cult might truly be determined to bring down bandits that are preying on innocents; they are simply driven by the delusion that there are no other alternatives to bloodshed. Another common delusion is that the current world must be cleansed in bloody battle to clear the path for a peaceful world—these cultists are only fighting today so that their children may know peace tomorrow.": "虽然大多数 \"孤儿王 \"的邪教都是被无情的侵略所驱使，但他们也可能认为自己在为更大的利益服务。一个堕落的邪教组织可能真的决心打倒那些掠夺无辜者的强盗；他们只是被一种错觉所驱使，即除了流血之外没有其他选择。另一个常见的错觉是，必须在血腥的战斗中清洗当前的世界，为和平的世界扫清道路--这些邪教分子今天的战斗只是为了让他们的孩子明天能知道和平。",
	"The Rage of War has a particularly strong following among the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, but he has drawn strength from the Last War and cults can be found anywhere in the Five Nations, especially in communities that suffered serious losses during the war.

But Rak Tulkhesh's forces are primarily mortal. In addition to the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, many of the {@creature minotaur||minotaurs} of Droaam revere Rak Tulkhesh in the guise of the Horned Prince.

The {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} warlock is a possible path for a cultist bound to Rak Tulkhesh; your weapon could be an artifact from the Age of Demons, forged by Mordakhesh the Shadowsword.

Sul Khatesh has no need of mortal souls, but a cultist might believe they have sworn their soul to her. What truly delights her is when magic is used for cruel purposes or in ways that cause people to fear it. While cultists may forge a bond for rational reasons, the more people that draw on her gifts, the more that corruption can creep in. Members of the Court of Shadows believe that they are part of a shadow kingdom that becomes more real with each day; some members even believe they can see its towers and spires overlapping the structures of the real world. Other cults may become obsessed with their own power, embracing the idea that those who can do magic are superior to those who cannot—that it is their right to prey on these mundane cattle. Given her love of secrets, the cults of Sul Khatesh are almost always hidden and subtle.

The primary question for such a warlock is whether you still serve her—whether you are seeking to rise in the Court of Shadows even as you go about your adventuring career—or whether you regret the bargain that you made and are trying to find a way out. Any spellcaster could have received a boon from Sul Khatesh even if they don't have the close bond of a warlock; did she teach you your first spell in your dreams, and are you afraid she'll return to call in this favor?

A cult of Sul Khatesh could be at the center of a web of blackmail that's tearing a city apart.

Victims of Valaara's delusions may believe that they are insects transformed into human form, or that they are being controlled or consumed by parasites. Its most widespread cult calls itself the Hive; members of this sect surrender their individuality to serve the collective, with mammals acting as if they're insects. The question when dealing with the Hive is whether it's solely a delusion and the victims can be saved, or whether the cultists truly have been consumed from within by Valaara's children, and are simply wearing human shells.": "daelkyr Valaara与昆虫和各种爬行的害虫一起工作。它的孩子们就在我们周围，在墙壁里倾听，吞噬我们的死者。在创造新的和致命的昆虫和蛛形纲动物的同时，瓦拉拉也在进行昆虫意识的实验，将一个人形的思想扩散到多个身体上。瓦拉拉妄想症的受害者可能会相信他们是转化成人形的昆虫，或者相信他们被寄生虫控制或吞噬。它最广泛的邪教自称为 \"蜂巢\"；这个教派的成员放弃他们的个性，为集体服务，哺乳动物的行为就像他们是昆虫一样。处理 \"蜂巢 \"的问题是，这是否只是一种错觉，受害者可以被拯救，或者这些邪教分子是否真的被瓦拉拉的孩子从内部吞噬，而只是戴着人类的外壳。",
	"Beyond the Hive, Valaara's cults invariably interact with insects in some way. Some believe they are receiving divine messages hidden in the buzzing of insects. Others cultivate massive hives of telepathic insects or create charnel pits as a breeding ground for maggots.": "在蜂巢之外，瓦拉拉的崇拜者总是以某种方式与昆虫互动。有些人相信他们收到了隐藏在昆虫嗡嗡声中的神圣信息。其他人则培养了大量有心灵感应的昆虫蜂巢，或创造了炭疽坑作为蛆虫的滋生地。",

Swarms, {@creature spider||spiders}, {@creature scorpion||scorpions}, and other similar creatures can be found with Valaara's cults. However, as with all the daelkyr, Valaara takes natural things and makes them unnatural. When using a relatively mundane insect as a base creature, consider what you can add to making it unnatural.

It creates symbionts that burrow into the flesh of the host; two of its gifts are the {@item throwing scarab|ExploringEberron} and the {@item spellburrow|ExploringEberron}, both presented in chapter 7.": "瓦拉拉创造壳质盔甲和活体武器。它创造的共生体可以钻进宿主的肉里；它的两个天赋是（%0%）和（%1%），都在第七章中介绍。",

	"A plague of unnatural locusts is stripping the land; what is drawing the insects here? A sect of the Hive is spreading through a squalid part of town, but are they preying on innocents, or are new members joining of their own free will? An insect follows the adventurers, whispering their secrets; is it a single warped creature, or just one drone from a telepathic hive?": "一场非自然的蝗虫瘟疫正在侵蚀这片土地；是什么吸引了这些昆虫？蜂巢的一个教派正在城镇的一个肮脏的地方蔓延，但他们是在掠夺无辜者，还是新成员自愿加入？一只昆虫跟着冒险者，低声说着他们的秘密；它是一个单一的扭曲的生物，还是只是一个心灵感应的蜂巢中的一个无人机？",
	"Members of the cults of the Dragon Below aren't always evil, and cults aren't always pursuing malevolent ends.

But what does it mean to be a barbarian drawing power from the Rage of War?": "下龙城的邪教成员并不总是邪恶的，而邪教也不总是追求恶毒的目的。上一节为玩家角色提供了大量与特定邪教有联系的想法。但是，作为一个从战争之怒中汲取力量的野蛮人意味着什么呢？",
	"Ultimately, the question is: what do you want it to mean? Do you want to play a character who knowingly serves a sinister power? Do you want to highlight the idea that while others see the power you deal with as evil, you interact with it in a positive way?

	"There are sources of divine magic that are concrete and clear—the Silver Flame is a pool of energy that binds the overlords, and spellcasters can divert its power for other purposes. There are other sources that are less certain—are the Sovereigns the deities their followers believe them to be, or is the power of a Sovereign cleric simply drawn from the power of collective belief? And then there's a third kind of source, where divine spellcasters draw power from devotion to forces that clearly are not divine and have no obvious way to grant such power. How is it that a warforged paladin can draw power from their devotion to the Lord of Blades when the Lord of Blades doesn't wield such power himself? Is a cleric of the Dragon Below actually receiving their power from a daelkyr, and if so, how?": "神圣魔法的来源是具体而明确的--银色火焰是束缚霸主的能量池，施法者可以将其力量转移到其他用途。还有一些来源不太确定--君主是他们的追随者认为的神，还是君主教士的力量仅仅来自于集体信仰的力量？还有第三种来源，即神圣的施法者从对显然不是神圣的力量的奉献中汲取力量，而且没有明显的方法来授予这种力量。当刀锋之主本身并不拥有这种力量的时候，一个战地圣骑士怎么能从对刀锋之主的奉献中汲取力量呢？低地之龙的牧师是否真的从戴尔基尔那里获得了他们的力量，如果是的话，是如何获得的？",
	"Ultimately, these questions don't need an absolute answer; after all, the most basic principle of divine magic is that it's not scientific and can't be absolutely explained. But here are a few ways to approach such spellcasters.": "归根结底，这些问题不需要一个绝对的答案；毕竟，神圣的魔法最基本的原则是它不科学，不能被绝对解释。但这里有几种方法可以接近这种施法者。",
	"The most common theory advanced by theologists in Eberron is that people with exotic or implausible beliefs who wield divine magic are actually drawing that power from another source without realizing it—that their faith is so strong that an actual existing power answers the prayer. Phthaso Mogan of Sharn has written a treatise in which he describes a man who performed miracles based on his fanatical devotion to his own shoe. Mogan concluded that the man was actually receiving his power from Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Travel. But while it's possible to draw spells from worshiping a shoe, this would be extremely rare. Though the cause is debated, scholars recognize that the more similar your target of worship is to an archetypal Sovereign, the more likely you are to be granted divine magic. And thus, over the ages, civilizations have gravitated toward worshiping a variation of the Sovereign Host.": "Eberron的神学家们提出的最常见的理论是，拥有异乎寻常或难以置信的信仰的人在挥舞着神圣的魔法时，实际上是在不知不觉中从另一个来源汲取了这种力量--他们的信仰是如此强烈，以至于一种实际存在的力量回应了祈祷。沙恩的Phthaso Mogan写了一篇论文，他在其中描述了一个基于对自己鞋子的狂热奉献而创造奇迹的人。莫根的结论是，这个人实际上是从旅行的主宰者科尔-科兰那里得到他的力量。但是，虽然有可能从对鞋子的崇拜中获得法术，但这将是极其罕见的。虽然原因尚有争议，但学者们承认，你崇拜的目标与典型的主权者越相似，你就越有可能被赋予神圣的魔法。因此，随着时间的推移，各种文明都倾向于崇拜一个变种的主宰者。",
	"Mogan also proposed that clerics of unusual faiths may actually receive their spells from the Traveler, who might support such ideas to cause chaos and undermine faith in established traditions. Korranberg scholar Dravo Den Talas has proposed an alternate theory: that if there is any truth to the beliefs of the Blood of Vol, {@i all} divine magic could be drawn from the mystic spark of the caster. According to Talas, the actual belief is irrelevant; it is purely the strength of faith that matters.": "莫根还提出，不寻常信仰的教士实际上可能从旅行者那里得到他们的法术，而旅行者可能会支持这样的想法，以造成混乱，破坏对既定传统的信仰。科兰伯格学者德拉沃-丹-塔拉斯提出了另一种理论：如果沃尔之血的信仰有任何真实性，（%0%）神圣的魔法可以从施法者的神秘火花中汲取。根据塔拉斯的说法，实际的信仰并不重要，重要的纯粹是信仰的力量。",
	"Regardless of what they conclude, the various theories generally acknowledge that a paladin who worships the Lord of Blades doesn't actually have to draw their power from the Lord of Blades himself. The power might come from within the paladin, it could be ultimately drawn from Dol Dorn or Onatar—or even be a gift of the Traveler.": "不管他们的结论如何，各种理论普遍承认，崇拜刀锋之主的圣骑士实际上不一定要从刀锋之主本人那里汲取力量。这种力量可能来自圣骑士的内心，也可能最终来自多尔多恩或奥纳塔，甚至是旅行者的礼物。",
	"Ultimately the distinction between divine spellcasting and arcane spellcasting is a question of flavor. There's nothing that says a paladin has to be considered to be a divine spellcaster. A kalashtar cleric could present their {@spell command} as psychic ability, while a paladin from a cult of the Dragon Below could describe Divine Smite or Lay on Hands as being empowered by a disturbing symbiont that encases the arms of the paladin. Warlocks and barbarians might seem more thematically appropriate for many of the cults of the Dragon Below, but the same concept can be applied to clerics or paladins; while they are driven by their faith, their powers are based on gifts, physical mutations, or otherworldly revelation, as opposed to coming as a literal answer to prayer.": "归根结底，神圣法术和奥术法术之间的区别是一个味道的问题。没有什么规定说一个圣骑士必须被认为是一个神术师。一个卡拉什塔教士可以把他们的（%0%）说成是通灵能力，而一个来自龙下邪教的圣骑士可以把 \"神圣打击 \"或 \"动手 \"说成是由包裹在圣骑士手臂上的一个令人不安的共生体赋予的。术士和野蛮人在主题上似乎更适合许多龙下之城的邪教，但同样的概念也可以适用于牧师或圣骑士；虽然他们受信仰驱使，但他们的力量是基于天赋、身体变异或其他世界的启示，而不是作为祈祷的字面答复。",
	"The Sovereign Host is by far the dominant faith of Khorvaire, followed by the Church of the Silver Flame, which has churches and shrines all across the Five Nations. While the Blood of Vol is a distant third, it has been well established in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities for over a thousand years. However, there are many other religions in the world. These include the druidic traditions of the Eldeen Reaches, the kalashtar Path of Light, and other faiths described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. In addition, players and DMs can always develop new religions, either as traditions that have recently appeared or as obscure faiths that have few followers. A few examples of uncommon religions are provided below.": "到目前为止，主权主机是霍尔韦尔最主要的信仰，其次是银焰教会，它的教堂和圣地遍布五国。虽然沃尔之血是遥远的第三位，但它在卡尔纳特和拉扎尔公国已经有一千多年的良好基础。然而，世界上还有许多其他宗教。这些宗教包括Eldeen Reaches的德鲁伊传统、卡拉什塔的光明之路，以及{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中描述的其他信仰。此外，玩家和DM可以随时发展新的宗教，要么是最近出现的传统，要么是很少有信徒的晦涩的信仰。下面提供了几个不常见的宗教的例子。",
	"The warforged (creation, evolution, ascension)": "战神（创造、进化、升华）",
	"This small cult believes that the souls of the warforged flow from a greater spiritual power. Those who follow the path of the Becoming God believe that House Cannith was merely a tool of the Becoming God; Cannith created bodies, but it was the God that shared its essence and gave the warforged life. Followers believe that each warforged holds a divine spark, that their people have a destiny, and that when they work as one, they can change the world. Followers seek to ensure a positive future for the warforged race, seeking to reactivate the old creation forges or to find a new way to create warforged. The faithful are also charged with helping to build a physical body for the Becoming God itself, and a community of warforged in the Mournland labors toward this aim. It could be that this vessel will be a vast form that dwarfs even the warforged colossi, but perhaps the Becoming God's size doesn't matter, only its perfection. Followers of the faith may receive visions of objects that must be located and brought to the Mournland to help with this quest.": "这个小邪教相信，战神的灵魂来自于一种更强大的精神力量。那些追随成神之路的人相信坎尼斯家族只是成神的一个工具；坎尼斯创造了身体，但却是成神分享了它的本质并赋予了战神的生命。追随者相信每个战神都拥有神圣的火花，他们的人民有一个命运，当他们团结一致时，他们可以改变世界。追随者们寻求确保战神种族的积极未来，寻求重新激活旧的创世锻炉或找到创造战神的新方法。信徒们还负责帮助为 \"成神 \"本身建立一个实体，而在哀伤之地的一个战锻人社区正朝着这个目标努力。这个容器可能是一个巨大的形式，甚至使战神巨像都相形见绌，但也许成神的大小并不重要，重要的是它的完美性。信仰的追随者可能会收到一些物品的幻象，这些物品必须被找到并带到哀牢地，以帮助完成这项任务。",
	"The cult of the Becoming God is notably less violent than the followers of the Lord of Blades. The faithful are determined to protect the warforged and help them reach their full potential, but they generally believe that it's possible to work with creatures of flesh and blood, and harmony is better than strife.": "成神的崇拜者明显没有刀锋之主的追随者那样暴力。信徒们决心保护战神，帮助他们充分发挥潜力，但他们普遍认为，与血肉之躯的生物合作是可能的，和谐比纷争更好。",
	"Destiny, divination": "命运，占卜",
	"Priests of the Draconic Prophecy embrace the idea that there is a guiding force underlying reality, and that they can see glimpses of its divine plan. A priest of the Draconic Prophecy believes that their divine powers are granted to keep the Prophecy on its proper path—that when a cleric uses {@spell cure wounds} to save a comrade, it's because that person isn't destined to die today. When they cast a spell such as {@spell commune}, it doesn't contact an extraplanar entity, but reveals a cryptic glimpse into the Prophecy itself.": "Draconic Prophecy的牧师接受这样的观点：现实中存在一种指导性的力量，他们可以看到其神圣计划的一瞥。Draconic预言的牧师相信他们的神力是为了保持预言的正确方向--当牧师使用{@spell cure wounds}来拯救一个同伴时，那是因为这个人今天注定不会死。当他们施展诸如{@spell commune}这样的法术时，并不是与一个星外实体联系，而是揭示了预言本身的一个隐秘的一瞥。",
	"Despite having priests, this isn't an organized religion and there are no clearly established traditions. It's a calling, and each champion must find their own path. Priests of the Prophecy are often set in opposition to forces that seek to manipulate the Prophecy and to use it for their own ends, notably the fiendish Lords of Dust.": "尽管有祭司，但这不是一个有组织的宗教，没有明确的既定传统。这是一种召唤，每个冠军必须找到自己的道路。预言的祭司们经常与那些试图操纵预言并将其用于自身目的的势力相对立，特别是邪恶的尘土领主。",
	"The warforged (conquest, revenge)": "战神(征服、复仇)",
	"The Lord of Blades is a warforged insurgent. He asserts that the warforged were created as tools and weapons, but now it is time for their former masters to reap the harvest they have sown. Some of his most devoted followers—who call themselves Blades—believe that there can be no peace between the warforged and creatures born of flesh and blood, and that there will come an apocalyptic reckoning between the two. They don't believe the Lord of Blades to be a god, but they do consider him to be a divine champion. There is a parallel here to the Becoming God, as the Blades believe the Lord of Blades is the vessel for the spirit of their people, the fulcrum of their destiny; the primary difference is that the followers of the Becoming God seek peaceful coexistence, while the Blades devotedly believe in both conquest and vengeance.": "刀锋之主是一名战锻人叛乱者。他宣称，战神是作为工具和武器被创造出来的，但现在是他们以前的主人收割他们所播种的成果的时候了。他的一些最忠实的追随者--他们自称为 \"刀锋\"--相信在战神和血肉之躯的生物之间不可能有和平，而且两者之间会有一场世界末日般的清算。他们不相信刀锋之主是神，但他们确实认为他是一个神圣的冠军。这里与成神有相似之处，因为刀锋战士相信刀锋之王是他们民族精神的容器，是他们命运的支点；主要区别是成神的追随者寻求和平共处，而刀锋战士则忠实地相信征服和复仇。",
	"Due to the antagonism between Blades and creatures of other races, this path would be an unusual choice for a player character, unless the entire party of adventurers is comprised of warforged. However, it's possible a Blade paladin could be pursuing a sacred mission—perhaps searching for a particular artifact or the secret of how new warforged can be created—that requires them to find a way to peacefully work alongside creatures of flesh. Perhaps along the way, they will conclude that coexistence is possible.": "由于刀锋战士和其他种族的生物之间的对立，这条道路对玩家角色来说是个不寻常的选择，除非整个冒险者队伍都是由战神组成的。然而，刀锋圣骑士有可能在追求一项神圣的任务--也许是在寻找一件特殊的神器，或者是寻找如何创造新的战神的秘密--这需要他们找到一种与肉体生物和平共处的方法。也许在这个过程中，他们会得出结论，共存是可能的。",
	"While the Blades believe that conflict is inevitable, they aren't fools, and few are bloodthirsty or cruel. Most Blades are combat veterans with tactical experience, and know better than to simply attack every human they encounter; when they act, they strike strategic targets and have a plan of attack. At the moment, there are working toward acquiring strategic resources, developing weapons, and striking at those perpetrating injustice toward the warforged. They may make bloody examples of their enemies, but most acts of violence are carefully planned.": "虽然刀锋战士认为冲突是不可避免的，但他们并不是傻瓜，很少有嗜血或残忍的人。大多数刀锋战士都是有战术经验的战斗老兵，他们知道最好不要简单地攻击他们遇到的每一个人类；当他们采取行动时，他们会打击战略目标并有一个攻击计划。目前，他们正在努力获取战略资源，开发武器，并打击那些对战神不公的人。他们可能会对他们的敌人进行血腥的杀戮，但大多数的暴力行为都是精心策划的。",
	"Nara smiled as she faced the assembled fiends. \"You're the ones who are outnumbered.\" Her spectral wings unfolded from beneath her cloak, rainbow feathers casting light across the chamber. \"All of the champions of the Silver Flame are with me, and no evil can stand against our power.\"": "娜拉微笑着面对聚集在一起的魔鬼们。\"你们才是寡不敌众。\" 她的幽灵翅膀从她的斗篷下展开，彩虹般的羽毛在房间里投射出光芒。\"所有银色火焰的冠军都和我在一起，没有任何邪恶可以对抗我们的力量。\"",
	"Divine magic is usually the product of deep faith and unyielding conviction, but an {@race aasimar|VGM} has a direct tie to a source of divine power and receives guidance from a celestial entity. Usually, these gifts aren't hereditary, and you can't necessarily identify an aasimar in Eberron by their appearance; there is no single recognized trait that defines an aasimar, and no reliable way of producing one. While the existence of aasimar may seem to fly in the face of Eberron's distant gods, it's important to remember that an aasimar needs no direct connection to a deity. An aasimar draws power from a divine energy source, and their spiritual guide is a celestial being—an angel, a couatl, or similar spirit. The aasimar may be marked as a champion of the faith, but even they can't prove the existence of the Sovereigns.": "神圣的魔法通常是深刻的信仰和不屈的信念的产物，但{@race aasimar|VGM}与神圣力量的来源有直接的联系，并接受天体的指导。通常情况下，这些天赋是不会遗传的，在Eberron，你不一定能通过他们的外表来识别Aasimar；没有一个公认的特质来定义Aasimar，也没有可靠的方法来产生一个Aasimar。虽然阿西玛人的存在似乎与Eberron的遥远的神灵格格不入，但重要的是要记住，阿西玛人不需要与神灵有任何直接联系。阿西玛人从神圣的能量源中获取力量，他们的精神向导是一个天人--天使、库阿特尔，或类似的精神。aasimar可能被标记为信仰的拥护者，但即使他们也不能证明主权者的存在。",

Fernian aasimar typically have crimson skin, and eyes or hair that burn with cold flame. Use the variant {@race aasimar (scourge variant; fernian)|ExploringEberron|Fernian aasimar} provided in chapter 6. Your guide drives you to provide comfort to the frightened and to battle forces of darkness. Fernian aasimar are often sorcerers wielding elemental flame; the {@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE} sorcerous origin is a good option to reflect your tie to your angel, or you can use the red dragon {@class sorcerer||Draconic Bloodline|draconic} origin, describing your features as angelic rather than draconic.": "你的向导体现了火的积极方面：提供光明和温暖的火焰，驱赶黑暗。费尔尼安-阿西玛尔通常拥有深红色的皮肤，以及燃烧着冷焰的眼睛或头发。使用第六章中提供的变体（%0%）。你的向导驱使你为受惊吓的人提供安慰，并与黑暗势力作战。Fernian aasimar通常是挥舞着火焰元素的巫师；{@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE}巫师出身是一个很好的选择，以反映你与你的天使的联系，或者你可以使用红龙{@class sorcerer||Draconic Bloodline|draconic}出身，将你的特征描述为天使而非龙人。",

Use the variant {@race aasimar (fallen variant; mabaran)|ExploringEberron|Mabaran aasimar} provided in chapter 6. Your guide still inspires you to follow the principles of its plane of origin, but it's fighting against Mabar's overwhelming despair and a hunger to drain the light and life from mortal creatures; when you use your Consuming Touch, you're channeling this energy to your guide. Your guide might hope you can someday release it from Mabar, though no immortal has ever escaped its corruption before. Or it could simply encourage you to follow the general principles of its plane of origin—balanced against its growing hunger and despair.

	"When Galifar was established, the province of Breland was granted dominion over all lands south of the Byeshk Mountains and west of the Seawall, extending to the waters of the Thunder Sea. This bold claim considerably extended the territory held by the preceding nation of Wroat—but it was nothing more than a claim. The Brelish people had no need of the lands to the west, nor did they want them. The Barrens—their name for everything west of the Graywall Mountains—were known to hold foul swamps and barren plains, an untamed region filled with all manner of deadly monsters. Explorers to Breland's newly acquired territory soon confirmed these tales. The plains were filled with goblins and hungry gnolls. The mountains were home to harpies whose songs could lead the unwary into deep chasms, where trolls slept on piles of bones. The Barrens had nothing the Brelish believed worth fighting for, and so it was left alone. Occasionally, questing knights or bold templars would cross the Graywall to battle giants and slay ogres, but the region was largely ignored.": "加利法尔建立时，布雷兰省被授予对拜什克山以南和海堤以西的所有土地的统治权，并延伸到雷海的水域。这一大胆的要求大大扩展了之前的Wroat国家所拥有的领土，但这只不过是一个要求而已。布雷利什人不需要西部的土地，他们也不想要它们。荒原--他们对灰墙山以西的一切的称呼--众所周知，那里有肮脏的沼泽和贫瘠的平原，是一个充满各种致命怪物的未驯服地区。前往布雷兰德新获得的领土的探险家们很快证实了这些传说。平原上到处都是地精和饥饿的地精。山区是女妖的家，她们的歌声会把不小心的人带入深渊，而巨魔则睡在成堆的骨头上。荒原上没有任何布雷利什人认为值得为之战斗的东西，所以它被冷落了。偶尔，探险的骑士或勇敢的圣殿骑士会穿越灰墙，与巨人作战，杀死食人魔，但这个地区基本上被忽视了。",
	"Over centuries, the Brelish slowly expanded west toward the Graywall. Castle Arakhain became a favored royal residence in the eighth century, bringing new prosperity to Ardev and Shavalant. However, the ensuing wave of western settlers was met by fierce raiders crossing the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake. Bloodied settlers brought back tales of bellowing minotaurs, orcs, ogres, and goblins lurking in every shadow. An attack at Castle Arakhain led to the brief Westward War, the might of Galifar driving the raiders back across the Graywall and obliterating many of the marauding bands. The fortress Orcbone was established as the gate between the people of Breland and the monsters of the Barrens, and the king founded the Westwind Riders to patrol the border. The Riders held the line throughout the ninth century, and Brelish settlers even staked claims along the Graywall. This period peaked with the founding of the fortress-town of Stubborn in the foothills (now known as Stonejaw). Then the Last War changed everything.": "几个世纪以来，布雷利什人慢慢向西边的灰墙扩张。阿拉哈因城堡在第八世纪成为了受人青睐的皇室居所，给阿德夫和沙瓦兰特带来了新的繁荣。然而，随之而来的西部定居者的浪潮遭到了穿越灰墙山脉和银湖之间的凶猛突袭者的袭击。鲜血淋漓的定居者们带回了关于咆哮的牛头人、兽人、食人魔和潜伏在每个阴影中的妖精的故事。对阿拉卡因城堡的攻击导致了短暂的西进战争，加利法尔的力量将袭击者赶回了灰墙，并消灭了许多掠夺者。兽骨要塞被确立为布雷兰德人与荒原怪物之间的大门，国王成立了西风骑士团，在边界巡逻。骑士们在整个第九世纪都坚守着这道防线，布瑞利什的定居者们甚至在灰墙沿线提出了要求。这一时期的顶峰是在山脚下建立了要塞城镇Stubborn（现在称为Stonejaw）。然后，最后一场战争改变了一切。",
	"The land known as the Barrens is far older than Galifar or Wroat. While less fertile than the fields of Breland or Aundair, this region holds rich mineral deposits. Some believe it was the original homeland of the goblinoids, a theory supported by a significant number of Dhakaani ruins along and below the mountain ranges, as well as below the Great Crag itself. In the Graywall Mountains, a set of thousand-foot statues commemorate the six kings who came together to form the ancient Empire of Dhakaan. But while this region may have once been important to the dar, it was utterly devastated in their war against the daelkyr, compounded by the return of forces long held at bay by the empire. Vicious gnolls swarmed south from the Towering Wood. Fierce orcs emerged from the western swamp. Trolls and ogres came down from the mountains. Those dar that remained were infected with daelkyr curses; instead of standing together against the invaders, they turned on each other, and centuries of chaos and bloodshed followed. By the time it was done, all that remained of Dhakaan was ruins. Hobgoblins and bugbears had been eradicated in the region, and goblins were scattered and divided.": "被称为荒原的土地远比加利法尔或沃罗特更古老。虽然没有布雷兰德或昂代尔的田地那么肥沃，但这个地区拥有丰富的矿藏。有些人认为这里是妖精的原始家园，这一理论得到了沿山脉和山脉下的大量达卡尼遗迹以及大峭壁本身的支持。在灰墙山脉，有一组千尺雕像纪念六位国王，他们共同组成了古代达卡尼帝国。但是，虽然这个地区可能曾经对达尔人很重要，但在他们与达尔人的战争中却遭到了彻底的破坏，再加上长期被帝国牵制的势力的回归，使之变得更加复杂。凶恶的地精从高耸的森林向南涌来。凶猛的兽人从西部的沼泽地里出现。巨魔和食人魔从山上下来。那些留下来的达尔人被daelkyr的诅咒所感染；他们没有站在一起对抗入侵者，而是互相攻击，几个世纪的混乱和流血随之而来。当一切结束时，达卡安只剩下了废墟。霍布林和虫族已经在该地区被根除，妖精们被分散和分裂。",
	"The region was dominated by anarchy from then on—some believe this merely follows the natural instincts of the region's inhabitants, while others point to the lingering influence of the daelkyr. There were a few bastions of civilization—the Venomous Demesne, the hidden village of Lost—but the people of these communities had no interest in expanding their culture; they were either fortified, hidden from the outside world, or both. Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as \"chieftain,\" but it literally means \"boss\" or \"big person\"—and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll—a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind. But while powerful, these creatures lacked the ambition or drive to build anything that could last. Occasionally a more intelligent leader—a minotaur warlord, a charismatic oni—would build a greater force, perhaps even establish a dynasty that would last a generation or two before being overwhelmed by the relentless, brutal tide.": "从那时起，该地区就被无政府状态所支配--有些人认为这只是遵循该地区居民的自然本能，而其他人则指出daelkyr的影响挥之不去。有几个文明的堡垒--毒妖院、隐蔽的迷失村--但这些社区的人对扩展他们的文化没有兴趣；他们要么筑起了防御工事，要么对外界隐藏起来，或者两者都有。在荒原的其他地方，历史被无数强大的奇布的崛起和衰落所标记。奇布是一个哥布林术语，有时被翻译成 \"酋长\"，但它的字面意思是 \"老板 \"或 \"大人物\"--而在荒原上，奇布往往只是周围最大的生物。通常情况下，一支队伍会围绕食人魔、艾丁或巨魔形成--一种足以对哥布林、哥布林或较小的同类生物宣示其意志的生物。但是，虽然强大，这些生物缺乏野心或动力来建立任何可以持久的东西。偶尔，一个更聪明的领导者--牛头人军阀，一个有魅力的鬼怪--会建立一个更强大的力量，也许甚至会建立一个王朝，在被无情的、残酷的潮流所淹没之前持续一两代。",
	"As the Last War began, the harpies held the Byeshk Mountains, where their flights endlessly feuded. Cazhaak Draal was in the hands of the medusas that claimed it centuries earlier. Wise creatures knew to avoid the Watching Woods, home to worgs and worse. In the plains, the strongest leader was the minotaur warlord Rhesh Toraa; around her keep, countless minor chibs fought one another more frequently than they struck the settlers.": "当最后的战争开始时，哈皮人占据了拜什克山，他们的飞行在那里无休止地争斗。卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）在几个世纪前被梅杜莎人占领。聪明的生物知道要避开观察之林，那里是虫子和更坏的人的家。在平原上，最强大的领袖是牛头人军阀雷什-托拉（Rhesh Toraa）；在她的堡垒周围，无数的小怪兽互相争斗，比他们袭击定居者还要频繁。",
	"The first days of the Last War led to a reduction of forces in the west of Breland; while it was a violent, unstable region, there were few settlers across the Graywall needing protection. Not all of the Westwind Riders were Brelish, and with Wroaan's coronation, soldiers returned to serve their home nations, and Wroaan needed all the troops she could muster. She reduced the Westwind Riders to a minimal force—enough to patrol between the fortresses of Orcbone and Stubborn, but little more.": "最后战争的最初几天导致布雷兰西部的部队减少；虽然这是一个暴力、不稳定的地区，但灰墙对面需要保护的定居者很少。并非所有的西风骑士都是布瑞尔人，随着沃罗安的加冕，士兵们回到了自己的国家效力，而沃罗安需要她能召集的所有部队。她将西风骑士团的兵力减少到最低限度--足以在兽骨堡垒和顽固堡垒之间巡逻，但也仅此而已。",
	"Many Aundairians had been part of the Westwind Riders, and on receiving their reports, Spy Master ir'Galanatyr saw an opportunity. The Royal Eyes of Aundair worked with Rhesh Toraa and other chibs in the Barrens, providing equipment and training to support attacks against Graywall settlers and raids across the gap. With forces tied up to the east, it was up to the commanders of Orcbone and Stubborn to protect the west. But ultimately, the provocateurs from Aundair and Karrnath found the Barrens raiders undisciplined and impossible to unify, never posing the dire threat Breland's enemies had hoped for.": "许多Aundair人曾是西风骑兵的一部分，在收到他们的报告后，间谍大师ir'Galanatyr看到了一个机会。Aundair的皇家之眼与Rhesh Toraa和荒原上的其他部落合作，提供装备和训练，以支持对灰墙定居者的攻击和跨越缺口的袭击。由于部队被束缚在东部，保护西部就要靠兽骨和顽固派的指挥官了。但最终，来自Aundair和Karrnath的挑衅者发现，巴伦斯的袭击者缺乏纪律，无法统一，从未构成布瑞兰的敌人所希望的可怕威胁。",
	"The fortress-town of Stubborn survived decades of raids and skirmishes, as the chibs of the Barrens had no patience for sieges and no weapons for breaking strong walls. Many lesser settlements and claims were overrun and lost, but Stubborn repelled countless attacks by goblins and minotaurs. However, it was utterly unprepared for the force that struck it in the last decade of the war. A typical band of raiders might include a single troll or a handful of ogres, but in 986 YK, the soldiers of Stubborn found themselves facing phalanxes of armored trolls fighting with deadly skill, and squads of ogres acting with discipline and coordination. Stubborn's defenders leapt off the walls in pursuit of harpies' songs, and the walls were shattered by hurled stones. Survivors were herded into the plains to face the leaders of the army; this was the first recorded encounter with the assembled Daughters of Sora Kell, three enigmatic hags discussed in depth later in this chapter.": "斯特伯恩要塞镇在几十年的袭击和小规模冲突中幸存下来，因为荒原上的赤匪对围攻没有耐心，也没有武器可以打破坚固的城墙。许多较小的定居点和领地被攻破并失去了，但斯图本击退了地精和牛头人的无数次进攻。然而，在战争的最后十年里，它对袭击它的力量完全没有准备。一个典型的突击队可能包括一个巨魔或少数食人魔，但在公元986年，顽固派的士兵发现他们面对的是以致命技巧作战的装甲巨魔方阵，以及以纪律和协调行动的食人魔方阵。斯特伯恩的守卫者在追寻哈皮斯的歌声中跃下城墙，城墙被投掷的石块击碎。幸存者被驱赶到平原，面对军队的首领；这是第一次有记录的与索拉-凯尔的女儿们的相遇，这三个神秘的女巫在本章后面将深入讨论。",
	"\"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\" Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"": "\"告诉你们的统治者，西部有一股新的力量，\"索拉-卡特拉告诉顽石的人们。\"你们称之为荒原的地方，我们现在称之为德罗阿姆。灰墙之外和Byeshk之下的土地属于我们的人民。迅速撤出你们的，尊重我们的要求；下一次，将没有幸存者。\"",
	"Once news of the fall of Stubborn reached Orcbone, the Westwind Riders traveled west in full force. But Sora Katra was true to her word; there were no survivors, nor any records of the last battle of the Westward Riders. A retaliatory strike from Droaam—merely a fraction of the forces at Stubborn—inflicted terrible damage on Orcbone itself. King Boranel swiftly deployed all the soldiers he could spare to this new front, reinforcing and fortifying Orcbone. In 987 YK, he formally ordered all Brelish citizens to withdraw from the lands west of Graywall, but he refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Daughters, and over the next decade, clashes continued.": "斯特伯恩陷落的消息一传到奥克本，西风骑士就全力向西行进。但索拉-卡特拉言出必行；没有幸存者，也没有任何关于西风骑士最后一战的记录。来自德罗阿姆的报复性打击--仅仅是斯特伯恩部队的一小部分--对奥克邦本身造成了可怕的破坏。博拉内尔国王迅速将他能抽出的所有士兵部署到这条新的战线上，加强并巩固了奥克邦。公元987年，他正式命令所有布莱里什公民撤出灰墙以西的土地，但他拒绝承认女儿国的主权，在接下来的十年里，冲突不断。",
	"To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere—and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya's Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya's Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved—that Maenya's lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation—but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.": "对于灰墙山脉以东的人们来说，索拉-凯尔的女儿们似乎是突然出现的，而对于荒原上的手足们来说，感觉也差不多。但有证据表明，这是多年、甚至几十年计划的结果。训练现在被称为玛尼亚之拳的巨魔和食人魔花了多长时间？女儿们是如何获得这支部队所挥舞的盔甲和武器的？有人说，索拉-玛尼亚在拜什克山下深处一个被遗忘的达卡尼堡垒里集结了她的部队，她在这个古老的铸造厂里监督了他们武器的锻造过程。索拉-梅尼亚称梅尼亚之拳的士兵为她的孩子，一些学者认为这可能是真的；她的战争巨魔和碎颅食人魔都比他们的普通表亲更聪明，更有能力。但这样的努力需要多长时间？科兰伯格图书馆的梅里安-米特-达万迪提出了一个理论，即半平面可能参与其中--缅因亚在开伯尔的巢穴可能存在于正常的时间流之外，使女儿们的计划既是最近的发展，又是几代人的努力。索拉-泰拉扎在公元985年接触了石像女王和毒液神殿的领主，女儿们在这段时间内为兹尼尔协议的一半雇佣兵提供了中介服务。没有人知道女儿们花了多长时间来准备--但公元986年，她们的存在才被人所知。",
	"Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with—and dominated—the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.": "在进攻顽固派之前，女儿们与荒原上最强大的力量对话，并且支配了这些力量。平原上的赤匪只懂得武力，而女儿们展示了武力；分散的突击队被迫屈服，那些拒绝向索拉-凯尔的女儿们屈服的人被以可怕的方式处决。",
	"In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region's most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient—when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters—Maenya's Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.": "公元987年，索拉-凯尔的女儿们将该地区最强大的领导人召集到现在被称为大峭壁的废墟上。在那里，索拉-凯尔提出了新国家的蓝图，任命了军阀并规定了他们的职责和区域。这个新国家最伟大的城市的工作开始了。灰墙、大峭壁和港口城市弗拉基克。古老的顽固堡垒被重新利用，并更名为石爪。虽然一些突击队被留下来沿袭他们的老路，但许多人被吸收到新国家。成千上万的地精和哥布林从压迫他们的阶级中解放出来，在新的城市中获得了机会。这个新的秩序由兹尼尔条约的地精维和人员来维持。当这被证明是不够的时候--当一个奇布拒绝释放他们的俘虏或藐视女儿们的时候--马恩雅的拳头就会降下来摧毁他们。这个信息很简单。改变即将到来。你可以在德罗阿姆找到自己的位置，也可以选择被消灭。",
	"The Daughters' ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam—at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Gargoyles and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. In Sharn, the Gargoyle replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable.": "女儿们的雄心勃勃的计划因与塔拉什克家族的结盟而得到加强。对塔拉什克来说，这提供了获得德罗阿姆丰富的矿产资源和畸形的雇佣兵服务的机会，这为该家族开辟了一条全新的道路。对女儿们来说，这将她们与一个在东方具有合法声音和影响力的势力联系在一起。塔拉什克的代理人说服了十二门徒会向德罗阿姆开放贸易--至少是向灰墙这个新城市开放。该家族帮助组织劳工，建造新的城市。通过Tharashk，Droaam的居民开始出现在整个五国，尽管在Orcbone附近的紧张局势仍在继续。夜行神龙和鹰身人在沙恩找到了自己的位置。在费尔哈文和沃罗特可以找到食人魔劳工。在沙恩，夜行神龙取代了八风之神中的蝙蝠。今天，五国的许多公民仍然对这些生物感到不舒服，但它们的存在正在慢慢变得不那么引人注目。",
	"The Daughters of Sora Kell sent representatives to Thronehold for the treaty negotiations, demanding to be recognized as a sovereign nation. This petition was denied. In practice, Droaam its territory. But legally, the land is still part of Breland. It's debatable whether the Droaamites are legally invaders or rebels defying the Brelish crown, but either way, they aren't considered citizens of Breland and aren't entitled to the protections of the Code of Galifar. However, their standing outside the law makes them a haven for war criminals, dissidents, deserters, and others who can find no place in the Five Nations.": "索拉-凯尔的女儿们派代表到王座镇参加条约谈判，要求被承认为一个主权国家。这一请求被拒绝了。实际上，德罗阿姆其领土。但在法律上，这块土地仍然是布雷兰德的一部分。值得商榷的是，德罗阿姆人在法律上是入侵者还是反抗布雷利什王室的叛军，但无论如何，他们都不被视为布雷兰的公民，无权享受加利法尔法典的保护。然而，他们在法律之外的地位使他们成为战犯、持不同政见者、逃兵和其他在五国中找不到位置的人的天堂。",
	"Most of the leaders of the Five Nations are convinced that Droaam won't last—that it's unstable, that these monsters will turn on each other any day now. They might be right; the Daughters have already had to crush a number of rebellious warlords and lesser chibs. But after eleven years, Droaam is stronger than ever. Its new cities are expanding. Dragonmarked houses are exploring their opportunities in the region. One important question still remains unanswered: What do the Daughters of Sora Kell want? Will they attack Breland in force if their demands aren't soon met? Or is there some grander scheme, tied to the prophetic visions of Sora Teraza?": "五国的大多数领导人都相信，德罗安不会持久--它不稳定，这些怪物随时都会反目成仇。他们可能是对的；女儿们已经不得不粉碎了一些反叛的军阀和较小的奇布。但在十一年后，德罗阿姆比以前更强大了。它的新城市正在扩张。龙纹屋正在探索他们在该地区的机会。有一个重要的问题仍未得到解答。索拉凯尔的女儿们想要什么？如果他们的要求不能很快得到满足，他们会不会大举进攻布雷兰？还是有什么更宏大的计划，与索拉-泰拉扎的预言相联系？",
	"While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride—driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. \"Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!\"": "虽然德罗安的所有公民都为索拉-凯尔之女服务，但每个地区都由一个军阀以女儿的名义独立管理，而在他们之下，奇布统治着当地社区。所有公民都被期望在被召唤时为他们的国家服务，并做任何被要求的事情。作为对忠诚和服务的交换，他们得到了食物、住所和自豪感--部分原因是他们知道自己在蔑视东方的傲慢国家。德罗亚姆的人民被鼓励相信他们是辉煌事物的一部分，这个事物还没有完全形成。\"今天可能很困难，明天可能更困难。但看看我们在一个十年里做了什么，想象一下我们在下一个十年里会取得什么成就！\"",
	"Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs—miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.": "在Droaam，一些公民有具体的、明确的工作--工人、石匠、士兵。其他人则是普通劳动力的一部分，可能每天都在换工作。这在不断扩张的大城市中尤其如此。然而，Droaam还不是一个高度组织化的官僚机构，如果你选择这样做，很容易从缝隙中溜走。在大城市中，许多公民追求自己的事业。那些看起来懒散的人或惹是生非的人被新闻帮派扫地出门，但那些显示出产业和对城市有贡献的人基本上被忽略了。归根结底，Droaam仍然是一个前沿阵地；这个国家只有十年的历史，它的城市仍在建设之中，还有许多变化尚未到来。",
	"While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist—ground meat made of troll flesh—that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder—the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.": "虽然许多外人可能认为德罗阿姆的制度听起来很压抑，但其大多数公民都真诚地致力于他们的新国家。在女儿们之前，他们的生活是残酷的、丑陋的。现在，他们拥有所有能吃的磨碎的巨魔肉，在当地的大厅里有一个屋顶和一张床，最重要的是，他们有了目标感。妖精可能会在矿场度过他们的一天，但他们知道他们正在建设一个伟大的城市，而不仅仅是为一个粗鲁的食人魔首领的粗鲁的想法服务。此外，许多市民真正敬畏索拉-凯尔的女儿们，在恐惧和惊奇之间取得了谨慎的平衡--对索拉-梅尼亚和她的拳头的实际恐惧，以及由索拉-卡特拉的话语激发的梦想。卓雅姆的人们知道索拉-凯尔的女儿们是传奇，她们拥有难以言喻的力量，而且索拉-泰拉扎知道未来会发生什么。大多数人真正相信，德罗阿姆有一个宏伟的命运，他们将藐视世界的期望，并且他们将共同建立一个辉煌的东西。",
	"Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.": "德罗亚姆有几种异国语言，从兹尼尔契约地精的喋喋不休到通过蛇的嘶嘶声和编织声相互交流的梅杜莎人。然而，这个地区曾经被达卡安帝国所统治，哥布林语长期以来一直是贸易的通用语言。几乎每个德罗阿姆人都会说哥布林语，或者至少能听懂。",
	"When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.": "当使用Droaamish生物的状态块时，你通常应该用哥布林来代替巨人或兽人。德罗亚姆的食人魔和巨魔与使用巨人语言的Xen'drik没有关系。兽人语言在几千年前就已经被淘汰了，如今在霍尔韦尔几乎已经绝迹，尽管可能有一个加兰兽人社区还在说这种语言。",
	"Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common—and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.": "通用语被用作一种贸易语言，在现代，除了哥布林语之外，许多生物也讲通用语。即使在女儿们到来之前，东部荒原的人们也经常因为与布莱里什定居者和西风骑士的交流而知道一点普通话。今天，女儿们正在鼓励普通话的传播，甚至已经开始在灰墙和大峭壁提供定期的语言课程，因为了解普通话对于商业和可以作为塔拉什克雇佣兵的生物来说是很有用的。归根结底，要由DM来决定一个特定的生物是否应该说普通话，如果是的话，它应该说多少。一个NPC有可能只知道一些特定的普通话短语，或者一个玩家角色将不得不进行魅力（（%0%））检查来向一个几乎不懂这种语言的生物传达他们的意思。",
	"Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.": "识字在Droaam较为文明的地区很普遍。梅杜莎人、铁弗林人和变种人一般都识字，从事商人或特使工作的人也一样。但目前，大部分普通民众都是文盲，这与五国不同，在五国，教育长期以来被视为一项基本权利。",
	"While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in {@i muut} or {@i atcha}, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms {@i chaat'oor} or {@i gath'dar} to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use {@i aravaat}—easterner—to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it.": "虽然Droaamites会说哥布林语，但他们并不像本章后面讨论的达卡尼人那样；他们对（%0%）或（%1%）没有兴趣，也不使用许多其他与达卡尼文化相关的词汇。值得注意的是，他们不使用{@i chaat'oor}或{@i gath'dar}这些术语来指代人类和他们的亲属。相反，他们用{@i aravaat}--easterner来指代五族人，更广泛地指代人类、半身人、矮人、精灵和类似物种。大多数德罗阿姆人不屑于学习霍尔韦尔不同国家的名称。西部是阴影地带，是塔拉什克的家乡，也是索拉-卡特拉的故乡。北部是高耸的森林，是索拉-迈尼亚的故乡。其他都是东方，这就是大多数人真正关心的东方。",
	"The nation of Droaam, which has only existed for eleven years, has a general structure established, but it's constantly evolving. The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice.

	"For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city—though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent. Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse—foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.": "目前，每个军阀都有权力统治他们的领地，并按照他们认为合适的方式组织自己的军队。无论是官僚还是士兵，都没有一个标准化的系统；在以前的荒原，最强大的地方官员仍然被称为chib，尽管他们可能不再是社区中最大或最有身体威胁的生物。在多个物种并存的城市中，普通民众被划分为士兵、熟练工人和普通劳动力；这些人由当地的奇布组织并在其直接领导下。这样的城市有一个磨坊（在本节后面讨论）和一系列的兵营，为所有工人提供食物和共同的住所。除非你有宝贵的技能或令人印象深刻的职位，否则你不会拥有财产，但你可以在任何城市找到免费的食物和住所--尽管由于城市仍在扩张以满足容量，在许多地方，这种住所就是帐篷里的床单。卡特拉的愿景是Droaam的所有生物都能一起工作，成为更大整体的一部分。理想情况下，努力工作的劳动者应该不用担心被虐待--工头们不应该心血来潮地殴打（或吃掉）他们的工作人员，这是对荒原生活的改进。卡特拉希望工人们的努力能得到尊重，就像戈林达尔人在凯奇达卡人中受到尊重一样。但是，虽然女儿们提倡这一理想，但在实践中并不总是奏效；仍然有lheshat残酷地对待工人。即使在工人受到良好待遇的地方，也会有这样的认识：任何挑战女儿会或军阀的人都会被毫不留情地击垮。",
	"In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:": "在任何特定的lheshat，军阀管理着他们的领地，而他们下面的兄弟们则领导着每个社区。但有三种力量在这个系统之外运作，直接为女儿们工作，并在整个土地上行使权力。",
	"The agents of {@b Katra's Voice} are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra's Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings, and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.": "{@b Katra's Voice}的代理人是特使和艺人、外交官和调解员。他们的任务是维持士气和沟通渠道，并在争端失控之前帮助解决。卡特拉之声的大多数代理人都是变种人，但也可以找到梅杜莎人、铁弗林人，甚至是哈皮人担任这一角色。许多人专注于他们作为艺人的角色，与普通人分享故事，描绘未来的光明前景。其他人则更注重调解和司法行政，特别是在奇布和劳工之间发生动乱时。",
	"A few elite soldiers of {@b Maenya's Fist} usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.": "一些精锐的{@b Maenya's Fist}士兵通常伴随着卡特拉之声的使者；如果声音不能抚平麻烦，拳头会结束它们。这些装甲巨魔和食人魔是致命的，并且完全献身于女儿们；一个战争巨魔可以粉碎一队不服从的牛头人。",
	"The agents of {@b Teraza's Eye} are sages, versed in the region's history and diverse customs. They survey ancient ruins and identify manifest zones and planar conjunctions. They often offer unsolicited advice to local warlords. Though the smallest of the three branches, some believe that those Eyes that are seen are merely the tip of the ankheg—that Teraza is served by changelings and other hidden agents who carry news of all developments back to the Daughters.": "{@b Teraza's Eye}的代理人是圣人，精通该地区的历史和各种习俗。他们勘察古代遗迹，识别显灵区和平面交汇点。他们经常向当地军阀提供不请自来的建议。虽然是三个分支中最小的一个，但有些人相信，那些被看到的眼睛仅仅是安克赫的一角--泰拉扎被变化者和其他隐藏的代理人所服务，他们将所有发展的消息带回女儿们那里。",
	"These names are the titles both of the organization and its officers; an agent acting on official business simply says, \"I am Teraza's Eye, and you will tell me what transpired here.\"": "这些名字既是该组织的头衔，也是其官员的头衔；执行公务的代理人只需说：\"我是Teraza的眼睛，你要告诉我这里发生了什么。\"",
	"Droaam isn't bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.": "Droaam不受加利法尔法典的约束，也没有统一的司法法典。因此，除非卡特拉之声推翻他们，否则正义完全掌握在当地长老手中。每个部落都有自己的卫兵部队。在一个小村庄里，这可能是一小撮加阿拉姆兽人，但在灰墙这样的大城市里，卫兵是一支多才多艺的重要力量：兽人、牛头人和食人魔，还有哈皮人和巨妖的支持。任何一个主要社区都有一支兹尼尔地精的驻军。这些雇佣兵在需要时充当维和人员，但他们直接为女儿会服务，而不是为奇布服务；在某种程度上，他们的存在是为了阻止奇布背叛女儿会。",
	"Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers—anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall—but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.": "归根结底，Droaam是一个狂野的边疆。在大多数情况下，法律很简单：不要招惹女儿国的人或任何属于女儿国的东西。警卫们并不关心随机的街头斗殴或酒吧斗殴。他们不关心是否有人偷了你的钱包。他们对一个逃犯在其他地方可能违反了什么法律不感兴趣。然而，他们确实关心对建筑物的重大破坏，或任何可能导致多个劳动者死亡的情况--任何威胁到社区整体生产力的事情。因此，玩家角色在Droaam可以逍遥自在，只要他们小心谨慎。当哨兵元帅逮捕躲在灰墙的战犯时，当地的守卫不会干涉，但当罪犯雇佣的三个巨魔袭击元帅时，他们也不会干涉。最重要的是，卫兵们要保护城镇和士兵；在德罗阿姆，个人权利和财产对低等公民来说意义不大。如果你想要正义，你通常必须自己制定它。",
	"In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.": "在大多数社区中，对严重的犯罪行为，法官会立即执行死刑。对于较轻的罪行，受害者会被打上烙印，要么被严刑拷打，要么被打成残废，要么接受战斗审判；大多数大城市都有一个竞技场，可以达到这个目的（尽管人们也可以选择成为角斗士）。那些在惩罚中幸存下来的人被释放了。",
	"There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it—but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice—but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.": "对于那些寻求正义的人来说，有一个求助渠道。卡特拉之声包括有权主持正义的治安法官。行政官在较小的社区之间穿梭，而较大的社区，如灰墙，则有一个常驻行政官。目前的时尚是，地方法官是medusas。如果地方法官认为一个案件有价值，她会命令法官处理它--但如果她认为投诉是轻率的，她会让原告石化。因此，很少有人冒着风险去寻求正义--但对于劳动者来说，知道他们可以这样做，是一种安慰。",
	"Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.": "灰墙有一个相当大的外国区，Calabas。灰墙的illithid军阀Xor'chylic授予Tharashk家族的Kundran Torrn起诉在Calabas犯下的罪行的权利；这意味着在该地区，Galifar法典的大部分内容具有影响力。这一制度可以适用于其他拥有相当多东部人口的社区。",
	"A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; {@i everyone} clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her—he needs to know better—but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.": "在考虑Droaam的法律和秩序时，要记住几个基本原则：虽然当地的卫兵一般不干涉街头的随意打斗，但致命的暴力并不像外人想象的那样常见。有一条不言而喻的规则，即大型生物拥有路权；地精知道要让开巨魔的道路。当然，也有例外；{@i everyone}为梅杜莎开出一条路。除此之外，大多数生活在大城市的德罗阿姆人都想成为卡特拉计划的一部分。巨魔知道，这些小妖精虽然很烦人，但应该是她的小兄弟。如果一个小兄弟推她，她会给他一记耳光，他需要知道更多--但她不会出手杀他，也不会吃他。如果你与巨魔作对，它可能会用爪子砍你；但如果你立即表示忏悔，冲突就会结束。相反，如果一群东方人开始挑衅，德罗阿姆人觉得对这些外来者没有这样的义务；即使卫兵不干涉，其他市民也可能会干涉，而聪明的人类在一个充满怪物的城市里保持低调。",
	"Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey—and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.": "怜悯和同情在Droaam是陌生的概念，既不期待也不提供。正义和复仇之间没有什么区别，如果你想得到这两种东西，你很可能必须抓住它。这个世界被分割成捕食者和猎物--做捕食者总是更好。活到最后是一种胜利，拥有住所和食物应该被庆祝，而不是被认为是理所当然。Droaam的人们是那些他们认为是朋友的坚定盟友，并为保护他们所爱的东西而战斗。但他们对陌生人的命运毫不关心：如果保护一个朋友意味着给陌生人带来痛苦，那就这样吧。",
	"Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.": "在创建Droaam的人物时，请记住这一点。如果你对陌生人很残忍，那是因为你认为这个世界是一个残酷的地方。你可能会追求高尚的目标，成为任何人都希望得到的最可靠的朋友，但你出生在一个残酷的世界，这是你唯一知道的生活。",
	"This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.": "这个残酷的世界正在发生变化。女儿们悬挂着一个更好的世界的梦想；卡特拉敦促德罗阿姆人把所有的战友都当成家人。为女儿们服务，你就会有食物和住所。但这一切都被这样一个事实所平衡：如果你挑战他们，他们会毫不留情地击垮你。而对大多数德罗阿姆人来说，这是一个非常合理的安排。",
	"Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth—so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage—\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"—adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam—or is perhaps even an ally—there won't be a bounty on its teeth.": "德罗亚姆没有既定的货币；日常劳动的标准报酬是食物和住所。大多数Droaam人依靠以物易物的方式购买商品、熟练劳动力或奢侈品。然而，主要城市的大多数商人接受东方的硬币，以及两种次要的 \"货币\"。矿工们经常使用小块的贵金属或宝石碎片进行交易。用带有赏金标记的牙齿进行交易和赌博也很常见。索拉-凯尔的女儿们（通过奇普斯）对某些危险的动物提供赏金，按牙齿支付。每颗牙齿上都会刻上一个哥布林符号，以识别它来自哪种动物，但大多数商人都不会接受牙齿，除非他们亲自认出该牙齿--所以你不能在狼牙上刻上 \"狼 \"字。虽然DM可以把标有赏金的牙齿当作另一种形式的硬币--\"老妖精提供了三颗流离兽的牙齿，价值10银\"--但杀死危险怪兽的冒险者可能会想知道他们的牙齿的赏金是什么。DM可以在《地下城主指南》第7章中的 \"个人宝藏表 \"上滚动，以确定对任何CR的生物提供的赏金。然而，牙齿的货币是基于女儿们对每个赏金的价值，而不是每个生物都有一张金口。一些危险的生物可能有很高的价值，而另一些则毫无价值。赏金是一种鼓励消除威胁的方式，如果一个生物没有威胁到Droaam的人民，或者甚至可能是一个盟友，那么它的牙齿就不会有赏金了。",
	"While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter—any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.": "虽然以物易物可能比用钱币交易更耗时，但这也是一个引入有趣的冒险钩子的机会。也许一个地精商人不能为一块铂金找钱，但她提供了一张废旧的牛皮纸作为交换；它看起来像一张地图，她说它来自城市的下面。达卡尼人的遗物、达尔凯尔战争的古怪残余、布瑞利什逃亡者当掉的东西--这些东西对提供它的人来说可能不值一提，但对接受它的人来说却是无价之宝。",
	"Droaam's main exports—brokered through House Tharashk—are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!": "Droaam的主要出口产品是通过Tharashk家族的中介--来自山区的byeshk和其他矿石，来自平原的Eberron碎片，以及其人民的雇佣兵服务。但它也是不光彩的商品的来源，这些商品在五国中通常是非法的。毒药是一个简单的例子，但还有其他更奇特的物质。龙血在{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}的第四章有描述。勇气是一种兴奋剂，可以使使用者在避免受到惊吓的拯救动作上获得优势；然而，长期使用会导致妄想症，并可能使人处于紧张的恐怖状态中。血杜松子酒是一种坏死的麻醉剂，由马巴兰显灵区的浆果在因暴力而死亡的人的血液中发酵而成；它在回放受害者生命的最后时刻时能引起欣快感，但经常使用它的人会做可怕的噩梦。这些只是几个例子，Droaam有许多其他地方找不到的非自然物品。它是异域生物的器官和皮毛的来源，这些可能是制造魔法物品的关键部件；如果你需要luecrotta的眼睛，灰墙市场可能是你最好的机会。德罗亚姆的市场还接收来自土匪的战利品，以及来自五国的逃兵、战犯和叛徒的零碎物品。总而言之，你永远不知道你会在地精市场上找到什么!",
	"In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the {@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron} table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne.": "在描述Droaam的商品时，要考虑到整个地区可以找到的大量风格和质量，其中一些在{@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron}表格中有所描述。荒原突袭者没有铁匠，用木头和石头的简单武器作战，或者用昂代尔或卡尔纳特提供的装备作战。然而，女儿们一直在努力改善这种状况，在许多更多的城市中可以找到地精和冥王的工匠工作。而毒液之神是一个神秘的先进社会；虽然他们缺乏坎尼斯家族的工业能力，但他们却能熟练地生产出超越五国的魔法珍品。德罗亚姆人使用的大多数魔法物品都来自于该王国。",
	"Droaam is a tapestry of many cultures with diverse beliefs. The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Demesne believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.": "德罗亚姆是一个由多种文化组成的织锦，有着不同的信仰。牛头人尊崇一个被称为 \"角王子 \"的存在，但每个部族都有自己对其守护神的私人称呼。妖怪们说他们用怒火的声音唱歌，但他们相信怒火是艾伯伦诞生世界时发出的痛苦呼喊。失落的变种人相信自己是旅行者的选民。兹尼尔契约的地精拒绝向任何神或魔物低头，而毒妖院的术士领主则认为神或魔物之间没有区别；只有可以被约束或讨价还价的力量。",
	"Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed—an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.": "尽管存在这种巨大的多样性，但整个地区对黑暗六神都有广泛的认可。虽然每个不同的亚文化都有自己偏爱的神灵和个人的扭曲，但大多数人都知道卡扎克信条的基本原则--由卡扎克-德拉尔的冥想家们对主权者和六神进行的解释。德罗亚姆的每个多元文化城市都有许多与小道相关的神龛和偶像，但真正的神庙是阴影之一，很可能是由美杜莎祭司打理。",
	"The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered \"monsters\" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.": "卡扎克信条》承认主权者的存在，但把他们描绘成对其崇拜者提出要求却不给予任何东西的暴君。相比之下，黑暗六人组支持自由和公平交换。根据该信条，影子是所有被东方人视为 \"怪物 \"的人的守护者。奥雷恩和九人组囤积了他们的力量，而暗影则给了它的孩子们奇妙的礼物：梅杜莎的目光、巨魔的再生、食人魔的力量。因此，影子是那些寻求神灵指引或干预的人最常召唤的神灵。",
	"Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find {@i your} path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species—from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.": "总的来说，卡扎克信条赋予黑暗六人组同样的价值，就像五国的皮里奈信条一样，但它将这些概念视为美德。阴影是野心的主宰，帮助你找到（%0%）通往权力的道路，即使这意味着在路上踩到别人。怒火是本能的主宰，如果你拥抱你的情绪，她会引导你度过难关；她也是复仇的主宰，这只是正义硬币的另一面。嘲笑者展示了通往战斗胜利的道路，即使这需要你拥抱背叛或恐惧；在Droaam，勇气和荣誉在胜利和生存面前是次要的。吞噬者挥舞着荒野的力量；他筛选出弱者，但那些经受住他考验的人却变得强大。守护者的祭司们执行殡葬仪式，这些仪式因物种而异--从使体弱者石化以便他们永远不死的梅杜莎人，到吃掉死者的巨魔和食人魔。祭司还充当治疗师，因为疾病和感染是守护者的工具，而祭司可以花钱消除它们。守护者是财富和贪婪的君主，他的祭司们总是愿意帮助请愿者提出交易。除了变革者之外，旅行者很少被直接崇拜，但它总是被承认。",
	"All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.": "所有这些都在《Droaam》中以许多微小的方式得到了回应。例如，狂欢是专门为 \"愤怒 \"举行的狂喜庆典，参与者被鼓励放弃一切克制，拥抱他们的情感。在战斗中，许多德罗阿姆人将杀戮献给守护者，希望通过为君主的囤积物增加灵魂来赢得青睐；同样，将意外之财的一部分献给守护者也是一种习惯，这样他就不会嫉妒了。",
	"Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.": "尽管（或因为）有许多不同的信仰和做法，德罗阿姆人还是非常纵容他人的信仰。Znir地精鄙视恶魔，但不干涉牛头人或铁弗林的做法。哈比人不与梅杜莎人争论愤怒的本质；他们知道真正的答案，这就足够了。每个人一般都尊重影子，即使这对不同的人意味着不同的事情。这个原则一般也适用于东方人。德罗亚姆人认为崇拜主宰者是愚蠢的，但如果你召唤奥里昂，也不会感到不安，而且不在乎卡拉什塔或精灵的信仰。",
	"There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam—the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone.": "对Droaam的宗教宽容有一个例外--银焰教会。教会认为他们的使命是保护无辜者免受超自然的威胁，而德拉姆的许多居民被视为 \"超自然的威胁\"。银色火焰已经带领许多突袭和任务进入荒原，黑暗族群不会很快忘记狼人的大清洗。任何公开佩戴银色火焰标志的人都会受到大多数德罗阿姆人的敌视，而且明智的做法是永远不要独自徘徊。",
	"Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn't feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.": "为什么荒原上的人们要花这么长时间来建造伟大的城市？在某种程度上，这是因为他们无法养活这样一个城市的人口。许多德罗阿姆的居民都是食肉动物，而那些不是食肉动物的人则缺乏大规模农业所需的纪律，无法养活像今天在灰墙或大峭壁发现的那些大量人口。这个简单的食物问题使荒原的人口受到控制。",
	"While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish—for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.": "虽然索拉-凯尔的女儿们用卡特拉的声音和梅尼亚的拳头来实施他们的统治，但他们也用食物来购买忠诚。索拉-凯尔的女儿们承诺，任何为她们服务的人都会有住所和食物。她们兑现了自己的承诺，提供了看似无穷无尽的食物供应。主食是一种被称为Grist的碎肉，可以作为炖肉、馅饼或香肠食用。碎肉又硬又酸，但却能填饱肚子，而且 \"碎肉厂 \"似乎有吃不完的东西。很少有Droaam人知道或关心grist的来源，但游客可能会比较胆怯，因为grist是由巨魔的肉磨成的，加工后供人食用。索拉-凯尔的女儿们掌握着加工格里斯特的秘密，在霍尔韦尔的其他地方是不吃格里斯特的。巨魔肉本身具有高度毒性和致癌性，但女儿们设计了一种神奇的草药和香料混合物，与磨碎的肉混合，使其可以食用。",
	"Every major town has a \"grist mill\"—a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate—though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily—stew, sausage, meat broth—but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew—there's plenty more where it came from!": "每个主要城镇都有一个 \"磨坊\"--一个提供磨料的公共食堂。碾磨厂包括装满巨魔的马厩；有些是作为惩罚而饲养的，有些则是为此目的而饲养的。他们的肉被慢慢切掉，总是留下时间让生物安全地再生--尽管这个过程的痛苦仍然令人痛苦。磨坊里提供的研磨剂的形式每天都在变化--炖肉、香肠、肉汤--但物质仍然是一样的，大多数东方人发现它是酸的和不愉快的。炉渣的一个好处是它是免费的。因此，请享受一碗炖糁--它的来源还有很多！\"。",
	"For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.": "对于那些有碎片或牙齿的人来说，还有很多选择。肉类是德罗阿米什的主食，而且大多数人喜欢几乎生吃；事实上，许多较小的巨人喜欢活吃。有些食物对人类来说可能是彻头彻尾的危险；例如，巨魔喜欢咀嚼干燥的腐肉爬虫触角，这对大多数生物都有显著的麻痹作用。有些菜肴是用一种微小的活体渗出物提供的，Droaamites认为这有助于消化。无论你走到哪里，菜肴都反映了该地区的异国野兽。在海岸线上，蒸熟的chuul备受喜爱，而在内陆，辛辣的流离兽则很受欢迎。",
	"It's commonly said that Eberron is \"wide magic, not high magic.\" The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society—communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster—finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.": "人们常说，Eberron是 \"宽泛的魔法，而不是高超的魔法\"。五国的文明是基于低级奥术魔法的应用，这些魔法被用来解决社会的问题--通信、娱乐、战争。然而，在Droaam，索拉-凯尔的女儿们正在建立一种文明，其基础不是广义的魔法，而是广义的怪物--为其不同公民的超自然天赋寻找公民应用。美杜莎的目光是一种可怕的武器，但石化也可以用来保护重伤或生病的人，直到他们能够得到适当的照顾。使用石像鬼作为信使，使用女妖作为镇上的传话人，这些都是他们自然天赋的明显应用，而制造麦片则是巨魔再生的一种更奇特的应用。在Droaam创造冒险时，要考虑如何以意想不到的、有用的方式使用怪物的天赋来推动文明。当你有一把锤子的时候，每一个问题看起来都像一个钉子。但是当你的工具是冥王星或石像鬼时，会发生什么呢？这里有几个应用要牢记在心。",
	"The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted \"songbird\" can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.": "东方的人们知道鹰嘴兽是一种怪物，它的声音可以引诱无辜的人走向死亡。但一个有天赋的 \"歌鸟 \"可以产生更广泛的效果，而不仅仅是不可抗拒的诱惑。一个有天赋的女妖的歌声可以激发希望或绝望，灌输快乐或使听众的眼睛流泪。鹞子在每个工作班的开始时都会唱歌，吸引工人们去完成他们的任务。每个磨坊都有一只鸣禽，它神奇的声音可以在下班时抚慰疲惫的工人。由于鹞子能以超自然的音量进行投射，鸣禽也能呼唤时间，并充当镇上的传令兵，在整个社区传递重要消息。",
	"The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it's not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with troll's blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is \"suck it up,\" but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce {@i troll's blood}, it could revolutionize public health.": "德罗亚姆的chirugeons采用的方法比乔拉斯科家族的方法更可怕，但这些技术仍然有效。Broodworms是一种蛆虫，其分泌物既能帮助麻醉病人，又能清洁受感染的伤口；微小的胶状方块也被用作一种不寻常的麻醉剂。虽然它还没有被广泛使用，但女儿们一直在用巨魔之血进行实验，这是一种具有显著治疗特性的药膏，事实上可能正是它所宣称的那样。德罗亚姆是一片严酷的土地，大多数时候，当人们遭受痛苦时，答案是 \"忍气吞声\"，但女儿们已经承诺在未来的日子里创造一个更好的世界。如果他们设法完善并大规模生产（%0%），它可以彻底改变公共卫生。",
	"With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.": "由于拥有众多食人魔和巨人，德罗阿姆拥有大量的原始力量。许多在五国需要专门设备或负重兽的任务，只需由一个巨大而强大的人形生物完成。",
	"The population of Droaam is staggeringly diverse. In addition to the sentient creatures that are part of this culture, the region is home to a remarkable number of monstrosities and exotic beasts. In part, this is due to the ancient influence of the daelkyr and the more modern experiments of Mordain the Fleshweaver. There are a considerable number of manifest zones in the area, along with passages to Khyber. But most of all, this has been a frontier for thousands of years. The central region of Khorvaire has long been home to powerful civilizations, and over time, its people actively worked to eliminate dangerous threats. Some monsters were exterminated, while others were driven away—and Droaam is one of the places they were driven to. There may have been a time when trolls and manticores roamed freely across all of Khorvaire; now, Droaam is the land of monsters.": "德罗亚姆的人口种类多得令人吃惊。除了作为这种文化一部分的有生命的生物之外，这个地区还有大量的怪兽和奇异的野兽。部分原因是由于古老的达尔凯尔（daelkyr）的影响和织肉者莫尔丹（Mordain）更现代的实验。该地区有相当数量的显灵区，还有通往凯博尔的通道。但最重要的是，几千年来这里一直是一个边境地区。霍尔韦尔中部地区长期以来一直是强大文明的家园，随着时间的推移，其人民积极努力消除危险的威胁。一些怪物被消灭了，而另一些则被赶走了--德罗阿姆就是他们被赶走的地方之一。也许曾经有一段时间，巨魔和尾兽在整个Khorvaire自由游荡；现在，Droaam是怪物的土地。",
	"So Droaam is a place where you can meet three impossible things before breakfast—and one of them may be the one serving you breakfast. While there are enclaves—such as Cazhaak Draal and the Venomous Demesne—that are largely populated by a single species, most of the great cities of Droaam are diverse communities hosting all manner of monsters. It's important to recognize just how varied the inhabitants of Droaam can be. There are significant differences in basic biology, psychology, and intellect. Ogres, trolls, hill giants, and ettins possess great physical power but are not as intelligent as humans, and Droaam's other citizens know to express things in ways they can understand and not antagonize them unnecessarily. Gargoyles are elementals and don't eat or drink; if you want to make a kind gesture to a gargoyle, you don't offer it a drink, you present it with a riddle.": "因此，Droaam是一个你可以在早餐前遇到三种不可能的东西的地方--其中一个可能就是为你提供早餐的人。虽然有一些飞地--比如卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）和毒蛇神殿（Venomous Demesne）--主要由单一物种居住，但德拉姆的大多数大城市都是容纳各种怪物的多样化社区。重要的是要认识到德罗阿姆的居民是多么的多样化。在基本的生物学、心理学和智力方面有很大的差异。食人魔、巨魔、山丘巨人和埃廷斯拥有强大的身体力量，但却不像人类那样聪明，德罗阿姆的其他公民知道用他们能够理解的方式来表达，而不是不必要地与他们作对。夜行神龙是元素，不吃不喝；如果你想对夜行神龙做出善意的表示，你不会给它提供饮料，而是给它出个谜语。",
	"Here's an overview of the most common sentient creatures in Droaam and the roles they play in society.": "下面是Droaam中最常见的有生命的生物以及它们在社会中扮演的角色的概述。",
	"The changelings who leave their city of Lost often work directly for the Daughters. Most use their skills as part of Katra's Voice, serving as entertainers, mediators, and bards; others gather information as Teraza's Eyes. Unless they have reason not to, the changelings of Lost wear their true faces; however, they use their shapeshifting aesthetically, creating exotic or ever-changing patterns across their skin. Skindancing is a changeling art that blends physical motion with transformation, and it can be a remarkable experience.": "离开迷失之城的变异人常常直接为女儿们工作。大多数人把他们的技能作为卡特拉之声的一部分，充当艺人、调解员和吟游诗人；其他人则作为泰拉扎之眼收集信息。除非他们有理由不这样做，失落的变种人都戴着他们的真面目；然而，他们在审美上使用他们的变形术，在他们的皮肤上创造出奇异的或不断变化的图案。跳舞是一种变化人的艺术，它将身体的运动与变形结合起来，可以是一种非凡的体验。",
	"Since the rise of the Daughters, gargoyles have been deployed across Droaam; they are also favorite recruits of House Tharashk. Civilian gargoyles serve as messengers and couriers, while most warlords also have a unit of combatready gargoyles that serve as scouts and rapid response. As elementals, gargoyles don't eat, sleep, or drink, and they can remain motionless for months or years. While gargoyles have traditionally been depicted as cruel predators, the fact is that they love the {@i thrill} of hunting. They yearn for challenge, and love riddles and puzzles almost as much as hunting prey.": "自从女儿国崛起后，夜行神龙就被部署到了整个德拉姆；它们也是塔拉什克家族最喜欢的新兵。民间的夜行神龙充当信使和信使，而大多数军阀也有一支可以作战的夜行神龙部队，充当侦察兵和快速反应。作为元素，夜行神龙不吃、不睡、不喝，它们可以在几个月或几年内保持不动。虽然石像鬼在传统上被描绘成残酷的捕食者，但事实上它们喜欢狩猎的（%0%）。它们渴望挑战，对谜语和谜题的喜爱程度几乎不亚于猎杀猎物。",
	"The mountains of Droaam are home to ettins and hill giants, both of which are native to Khorvaire. Ettins are distantly related to orcs, while the hill giants of Khorvaire are a form of ogre; while they use the same stat block as the devolved hill giants of Xen'drik, they aren't actually related. In the Barrens of the past, giants would come down from the mountains and dominate groups of goblins and kobolds. In Droaam today, they have primarily been drawn into heavy labor, as well as providing raw power to the armies of Droaam. Giants are not especially bright; as long as they are fed well (which requires a lot of food!) and celebrated for their efforts, they are generally content to serve their purpose.": "德罗亚姆的山区是埃廷人和山地巨人的家园，这两种人都是霍尔韦尔的原住民。埃廷斯与兽人有远亲关系，而霍尔韦尔的山丘巨人则是食人魔的一种形式；虽然他们使用的属性块与Xen'drik的进化山丘巨人相同，但他们实际上并没有关系。在过去的荒原上，巨人会从山上下来，支配地精和哥布林的群体。在今天的Droaam，他们主要被吸引到重体力劳动中，以及为Droaam的军队提供原始力量。巨人并不特别聪明；只要他们吃得好（这需要大量的食物！），并为他们的努力而庆祝，他们一般都满足于服务他们的目的。",
	"Vralkek is also home to a small contingent of giants from Xen'drik that found a home in this land of monsters. Most serve the fire giant Gorodan Ashlord, or at least acknowledge him as their spokesman to the Daughters of Sora Kell.": "Vralkek也是来自Xen'drik的一小队巨人的家，他们在这片怪物的土地上找到了家。大多数人都为火巨人戈罗丹-阿什洛德服务，或者至少承认他是他们索拉-凯尔之女的代言人。",
	"The gnolls of Droaam are described in more detail later in this section, and playable racial traits are presented in chapter 6. Every major city has a garrison of gnoll soldiers, who protect the interests of the Daughters. These gnolls aren't part of Maenya's Fist, and generally serve as peacekeepers rather than being used in punitive actions. Some warlords hire additional gnolls to serve their own personal agendas. While almost all gnolls in Droaam serve as mercenaries with the Znir Pact, there are always those whose services aren't currently contracted. Idle gnolls often work as hunters, selling fresh game to the local markets; grist is sustaining, but there are many creatures who prefer other meat when they can get it.": "本节后面将详细描述德罗阿姆的地精，可玩的种族特征将在第6章介绍。每个主要城市都有一支由地精士兵组成的驻军，他们保护女儿们的利益。这些地精不属于缅因州的拳头，通常作为和平的维持者，而不是用于惩罚性的行动。一些军阀雇佣额外的地精来为他们自己的个人议程服务。虽然在德罗阿姆几乎所有的地精都在兹尼尔盟约中担任雇佣兵，但总有一些人的服务目前还没有签约。闲置的地精经常作为猎人工作，向当地市场出售新鲜的野味；草料可以维持生计，但有许多生物在能得到其他肉类时更喜欢。",
	"Both goblins and kobolds were once oppressed underclasses within the Barrens, dominated by almost every other species in the plains. Over time, they developed their own shared culture that's entirely different from the cultures of either species elsewhere in Khorvaire; when someone says \"goblin\" in Droaam, it's understood that they mean \"goblins or kobolds.\" Most goblins and kobolds feel a close kinship and look out for each other. They learned long ago to value cunning over strength; the heroes of their tales are quick and clever. They are patient and enduring, and tolerate endless suffering while waiting for an opportunity to present itself.": "地精和哥布林都曾经是荒原上受压迫的下层阶级，几乎被平原上的其他物种所支配。随着时间的推移，他们发展了自己的共同文化，与霍尔韦尔其他地方的任何一个物种的文化都完全不同；当有人在Droaam说 \"哥布林 \"时，人们会理解为他们是指 \"哥布林或哥布林\"。大多数地精和哥布林都有一种亲密的亲属关系，并相互照顾。他们很久以前就学会了重视狡猾而不是力量；他们故事中的英雄都是敏捷而聪明的。他们有耐心和耐力，在等待机会的同时容忍无尽的痛苦。",
	"Those goblins who serve the Daughters of Sora Kell lead far better lives than their ancestors in the Barrens, and they are among the most numerous inhabitants of the large cities—and the most devoted supporters of the Daughters of Sora Kell. Most are especially excited about Kethelrax the Cunning, the kobold warlord; they believe that this marks the beginning of a new age where goblins will be recognized and rewarded for their work. However, there are still goblins in the domains of some warlords—notably Turakbar's Fist—who live miserable, short lives. While most goblins are content to focus on their work, some seek to help their oppressed kin or take petty vengeance on ogres and giants for the vast suffering inflicted on their people.": "那些为索拉-凯尔之女服务的地精过着比他们在荒原的祖先好得多的生活，他们是大城市中最多的居民--也是索拉-凯尔之女最忠实的支持者。大多数人对 \"狡猾的凯特拉克斯\"（Kethelrax the Cunning）感到特别兴奋；他们认为这标志着一个新时代的开始，地精的工作将得到认可和奖励。然而，在一些军阀--特别是图拉克巴的拳头--的领地里，仍有地精过着悲惨、短暂的生活。虽然大多数地精满足于专注于他们的工作，但有些地精寻求帮助他们被压迫的亲属，或者对食人魔和巨人施加在他们人民身上的巨大痛苦进行小规模的报复。",
	"The harpies of the Byeshk Mountains claim to be the children of the Fury, and they take joy in flight and song. They are wild and passionate, embracing love and hate alike with reckless abandon. Those harpies who left the mountains to \"sing Katra's song\" have embraced her vision and are thrilled to be building a nation with their voices. They are generally more intelligent than the standard harpy in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} and have more control of their supernatural voices, being capable of inspiring a range of emotions. Harpies call the hour and summon workers; they also help with crowd control, serve as town criers, and entertain the people.": "拜什克山的哈比人自称是怒火的孩子，他们以飞行和歌唱为乐。他们狂野而富有激情，不顾一切地拥抱爱与恨。那些离开山区去 \"唱卡特拉的歌 \"的哈皮人已经接受了她的愿景，并为用他们的声音建立一个国家而感到兴奋。他们通常比标准的哈皮在（%0%）更聪明，对他们的超自然声音有更多的控制，能够激发一系列的情感。哈比人呼唤时间，召唤工人；他们还帮助控制人群，充当镇上的传声筒，并为人们提供娱乐。",
	"In representing a harpy character or interacting with one, highlight their passion. Harpies {@i love} what they do; if they don't, they won't do it. Singing isn't merely a magical tool; it's a joyful act, a communion with the Fury and a work of art woven together. Whether singing weary goblins to sleep in a grist mill or acting as a courier in Sharn, harpies embrace life with absolute zeal. But harpies hate just as strongly as they love—and there are harpies who hate the Daughters and the entire idea of Droaam.": "在表现一个哈比角色或与之互动时，要突出他们的激情。哈比人{@i love}他们所做的事；如果他们不这样做，他们就不会这样做。唱歌不仅仅是一种魔法工具；它是一种快乐的行为，是与怒火的交流，是一种艺术作品的交织。无论是在磨坊里唱着疲惫的地精入睡，还是在沙恩充当信使，哈皮人都以绝对的热情拥抱生活。但是哈比人的仇恨和他们的爱一样强烈--有的哈比人憎恨女儿们和整个Droaam的想法。",
	"The harpies who work with the Daughters of Sora Kell are more intelligent than their cousins, and have learned to use their remarkable voices—which they can amplify up to three times as loud as normal—for more than just luring enemies.": "与索拉-凯尔的女儿们一起工作的哈比人比他们的表亲更聪明，并且已经学会了使用他们非凡的声音--他们可以将声音放大到正常的三倍--不仅仅是引诱敌人。",
	"A typical harpy songbird has an Intelligence of 10 (+0), a Wisdom of 12 (+1), and a Charisma of 14 (+2), along with the skills Performance +6 and Persuasion +4.

	"Most humans living in Droaam are easterners—brigands or renegades evading the law, or merchants seeking opportunities. However, a few are natives, serving Droaam as part of the Venomous Demesne. While the demesne's nobles are tieflings, humans are a significant part of the population, and Demesne humans can be found serving as magewrights in other cities. The humans of the Venomous Demesne have little in common with the people of the East and feel no kinship to the Five Nations.": "大多数生活在德拉姆的人类都是东部人--强盗或逃避法律的叛徒，或寻求机会的商人。然而，也有少数人是本地人，作为毒液王国的一部分为Droaam服务。虽然恶魔国度的贵族是铁弗林，但人类也是人口的重要组成部分，恶魔国度的人类也可以在其他城市中担任魔法师。毒妖国的人类与东方的人们没有什么共同之处，对五国没有任何亲属关系。",
	"There are relatively few medusas in Droaam, but their intelligence and mystical power makes them a vital part of this growing nation. Medusa architects direct construction in the blended cities, laying the foundations of what this nation will become. Medusas who choose to serve as Voices of Katra are often called upon to resolve disputes and enforce justice, for who dares challenge the ruling of a medusa? Cazhaak Draal is also the seat of the most organized religious tradition in Droaam—the worship of the Dark Six—and most powerful priests of the Six are medusas. Compared to many denizens of the region, medusas tend to be calm and rational; however, they expect to be treated with respect and aren't above a few harsh lessons to make a point.": "在Droaam，美杜莎人相对较少，但他们的智慧和神秘力量使他们成为这个成长中的国家的重要组成部分。美杜莎建筑师指导混合城市的建设，为这个国家未来的发展打下基础。选择担任卡特拉之声的美杜莎人经常被要求解决争端和执行正义，因为谁敢挑战美杜莎的统治？卡扎克-德拉尔也是德罗阿姆最有组织的宗教传统的所在地--对黑暗六神的崇拜，而六神最强大的祭司都是美杜莎人。与该地区的许多居民相比，美杜莎人倾向于冷静和理性；然而，他们希望得到尊重，并不吝于用一些严厉的教训来表明自己的观点。",
	"The medusas of Droaam are capable of receiving visual impressions through their serpent mane, and can close their primary eyes to prevent any threat of petrification. Medusa magewrights can also master a ritual—the Medusa's Kiss—that undoes the effects of medusa petrification, allowing this power to be used in a number of useful ways (such as preserving the life of a creature about to die). Medusas can control the movements of their serpents, and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal have developed a simple sign language called Serpentine that uses the movements of the serpents to convey messages. Other species can learn to understand Serpentine as an exotic language, but there's no way to speak it without a mane of living serpents.": "德罗阿姆的美杜莎能够通过他们的蛇鬃接收视觉印象，并能闭上他们的主眼，以防止任何石化的威胁。美杜莎魔法师还能掌握一种仪式--美杜莎之吻--可以解除美杜莎石化的影响，使这种力量可以用在许多有用的地方（比如保存即将死亡的生物的生命）。美杜莎人可以控制他们的大蛇的运动，卡扎克-德拉尔的美杜莎人已经开发出一种简单的手语，叫做蛇语，利用大蛇的运动来传递信息。其他物种可以学习理解蛇语，作为一种外来语言，但如果没有活蛇的鬃毛，就没有办法说这种语言。",
	"The minotaur clans of Droaam are spread across the plains. They are fierce barbarians and warriors who dominated goblins, kobolds, orcs, and other creatures in the days of the Barrens, and to this day, it is these clans that often lead raids into Droaam. However, this fierce aggression has prevented the minotaurs from becoming a major power, due to the long, destructive feuds between the clans themselves.": "Droaam的牛头人氏族分布在整个平原上。他们是凶猛的野蛮人和战士，在荒原时代主宰着哥布林、哥布林、兽人和其他生物，时至今日，正是这些部族经常带头突袭德罗阿姆。然而，这种激烈的侵略性使牛头人无法成为一个主要的力量，因为各部族之间存在着长期的、破坏性的争斗。",

Each clan has their own private name for the Prince and their own beliefs about the conduct he expects of his followers. In most cases, the Horned Prince seems to be an analogue to the overlord Rak Tulkhesh, desiring only bloodshed. However, the Red Hooves worship He Who Walks Behind, who is much like the Mockery; they focus on the use of terror and in deceiving their enemies. The Blade Breakers worship One Horn, who rewards strength and courage—much like Dol Dorn. The Dawn Harvest was a clan whose version of the Prince—the Dawn Gorer—encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in Droaam. The Dawn Harvest was destroyed by Maenya's Fist after refusing to accept Rhesh Turakbar as the warlord of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across Droaam.": "牛头人相信他们是被选中的战士，通常被称为 \"角王子\"，他们在战斗中磨练自己的技能，以便死后能加入王子。每个部族都有自己对王子的私人称呼，以及他们对王子期望其追随者的行为的信念。在大多数情况下，\"角王子 \"似乎是霸主拉克-图尔克什的类似物，他只渴望流血。然而，\"红蹄 \"崇拜 \"走在后面的人\"，他很像 \"嘲笑者\"；他们专注于使用恐怖和欺骗敌人。刀锋战士崇拜 \"独角\"，他奖励力量和勇气--很像多尔多恩。黎明收割者是一个部族，他们的王子--黎明之神--鼓励追随者以荣誉而战，并保护弱者，这两个特征在德罗安很少见到。在拒绝接受雷什-图拉克巴成为他们地区的军阀后，黎明收获被梅尼亚之拳摧毁；该部族的少数成员幸存下来，现在散落在德罗阿姆各地。",

Skullcrushers are well trained and act with military discipline.": "一个典型的碎颅食人魔有12的灵活性（+1），10的智力（+0）和10的智慧（+0）。他们精通重甲和武术武器，并且通常穿着板甲。碎颅者训练有素，行动具有军事纪律性。",
	"The origins of the oni are a mystery. Some people believe oni are the offspring of hags and giants, and that some are children or grandchildren of the Daughters themselves. Other stories claim there's a kingdom of oni in Khyber, likely a demiplane, and that the oni of the surface world are criminals banished from this wondrous realm. While rare, their intelligence and power make them valuable to the Daughters of Sora Kell. The oni Tzaryen Rrac is a trusted warlord, while other oni serve as commanders in Maenya's Fist, inquisitors in Katra's Voice, or administrators throughout the realm.": "鬼兽的起源是个谜。有些人认为鬼怪是女巫和巨人的后代，有些是女儿们自己的孩子或孙子。其他故事声称在开伯尔有一个鬼怪王国，很可能是一个半位面，而地面世界的鬼怪是被放逐到这个奇妙境界的罪犯。虽然稀少，但他们的智慧和力量使他们对索拉-凯尔的女儿们很有价值。鬼兽Tzaryen Rrac是一个值得信赖的军阀，而其他的鬼兽则在Maenya的拳头中担任指挥官，在Katra的声音中担任审问者，或在整个王国中担任管理者。",
	"Oni are cunning and curious. Some serve the Daughters in exchange for treasure, others for arcane lore, while some are simply content with the power they hold as agents of the hags. You could tie their broader goals to their true origin—if the oni are exiles from a hidden kingdom, they might be building power to reclaim that kingdom. If they are the children of the Daughters, they could be competing with one another to impress their parent, and generally engaging in sibling rivalry.": "奥尼是狡猾而好奇的。有些人为女儿们服务以换取财宝，有些人则是为了神秘的传说，而有些人只是满足于他们作为女巫的代理人所拥有的权力。你可以把他们更广泛的目标与他们的真正起源联系起来--如果鬼魂是来自一个隐秘王国的流亡者，他们可能会建立权力来夺回那个王国。如果他们是女儿们的孩子，他们可能会为了讨好他们的父母而相互竞争，并且一般会进行兄弟姐妹之间的竞争。",
	"Over countless generations of life in the Barrens, the orcs of the region developed two distinct cultures. The larger of the two are the {@i Gaa'aram}—Children of Wrath. The Gaa'aram embraced the chaotic, raiding lifestyle of the Barrens. Where the goblins and kobolds were often forced into service by more powerful creatures, the Gaa'aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa'aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa'aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they're the reason for the name of the Orcbone fortress that guards the Gap of Graywall. Gaa'aram orcs can be found in all of the diverse cities, and they're usually passionate supporters both of Droaam and their local warlords.": "在荒原上生活了无数代之后，该地区的兽人发展出两种不同的文化。两种文化中较大的是愤怒的孩子（%0%）。Gaa'aram接受了荒原上混乱的、突袭的生活方式。地精和哥布林经常被更强大的生物强迫服役，而Gaa'aram则自愿团结在最强大的领导者周围，充当凶猛的战士。对于加阿兰的兽人来说，为谁而战并不那么重要，重要的是你要战斗，而且要打得好。因此，加阿兰兽人经常作为突袭者遇到；他们是守卫灰墙峡的兽骨堡垒名称的原因。Gaa'aram兽人可以在所有不同的城市中找到，他们通常是Droaam和他们当地军阀的热情支持者。",
	"In the days before Droaam, few people of the Five Nations had even heard of the smaller of the two cultures, the {@i Gaa'ran}—Children of Sacrifice. The Gaa'ran orcs are pacifists and farmers—one of the only cultures to farm in the open Barrens. They believe that violence stains the soul—that those whose souls are pure pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa'ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torture and death, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa'ran settlements to stand—with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa'ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa'ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.": "在Droaam之前的日子里，五国中很少有人听说过两种文化中较小的一种，即牺牲的孩子（%0%）。Gaa'ran兽人是和平主义者和农民，是唯一在空旷的荒原上耕作的文化之一。他们相信暴力会玷污灵魂--那些灵魂纯洁的人可以超越多鲁尔，但杀害他人会永远毁掉你的一块灵魂。Gaa'ran人即使面对酷刑和死亡也坚持自己的信仰，随着时间的推移，荒原上的部落允许Gaa'ran人的定居点存在，但他们的理解是，当地的袭击者会定期出现并拿走他们的产品。虽然这是一种严酷的生活，但在索拉-凯尔的女儿们的带领下，Gaa'ran人已经繁荣起来了。虽然麦芽是德罗阿姆的主要生计来源，但女儿们认识到农业的价值，加阿兰部落得到了资源，并被安排负责一些农业项目。",
	"The Gaa'aram and Gaa'ran are both local cultures with no direct ties to other orcs of Eberron. Gaa'aram orcs are among those monstrous mercenaries House Tharashk has recruited in Droaam. The Gaa'ran have a talent for primal magic that suggests they were once tied to the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches, but they are not Gatekeepers and don't fight aberrations; their interest lies solely in cultivation.": "Gaa'aram和Gaa'ran都是本地文化，与Eberron的其他兽人没有直接联系。Gaa'aram兽人是Tharashk家族在Droaam招募的那些畸形的雇佣兵之一。加阿兰人有一种原始魔法的天赋，这表明他们曾经与阴影地带的守门人有联系，但他们不是守门人，也不与反常者作战；他们的兴趣只在于修炼。",
	"There are a significant number of shifters among the humanoid population of Droaam. In the former Barrens, shifters were largely mixed together with the Gaa'aram orcs, much the same way that the goblins and kobolds of Droaam have formed a collective culture. These orcs call shifters {@i taarka'va}—wolf brothers. Pairings between shifter and orc can produce offspring, but the resulting half-orcs are almost always sterile.": "在Droaam的人形人口中，有相当数量的变身者。在以前的荒原上，变身者很大程度上与加阿兰兽人混在一起，就像德罗阿姆的哥布林和哥布林形成了一种集体文化一样。这些兽人称变身者为{@i taarka'va}-狼兄弟。变换者和兽人之间的配对可以产生后代，但产生的半兽人几乎总是不育。",
	"Another group of shifters are found in the Watching Woods. They call themselves {@i Ur'haakar}—First Panthers. These shifters shun civilization and take pride in their primal connection. Experts at stealth, they possess both Hunter rangers and Living Weapon monks. A few of the Ur'haakar have joined the Dark Pack and left the woods to serve the Daughters and Droaam, but most of the panthers prefer their isolation and consider the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack to be corrupted shifters.": "在守望森林中还发现了另一群变身者。他们自称为{@i Ur'haakar}--第一豹。这些变身者回避文明，以他们的原始联系为荣。他们擅长隐蔽，同时拥有猎人游侠和活体武器修士。少数Ur'haakar人加入了黑暗族群，并离开森林为女儿们和Droaam服务，但大多数黑豹喜欢与世隔绝，并认为黑暗族群的狼人是被腐蚀的变异者。",
	"The Venomous Demesne lies in the west of Droaam, hidden by powerful illusions. It was founded by tiefling refugees from the ancient Sarlonan kingdom of Ohr Kaluun, and its four ruling families possess great knowledge and vast arcane power. Tiefling wizards and warlocks can be found serving as Katra's Voice or Teraza's Eye. The people of the Venomous Demesne—including a significant human population—look down on both the inhabitants of Droaam and the Five Nations, but they value their alliance with the Daughters of Sora Kell and are willing to suffer some indignities for this cause.": "毒液王国位于德罗阿姆的西部，被强大的幻象所隐藏。它是由来自古老的萨洛南王国Ohr Kaluun的铁弗林难民建立的，它的四个统治家族拥有丰富的知识和巨大的奥术力量。铁弗林的巫师和术士可以被发现担任卡特拉之声或泰拉扎之眼。毒妖国的人民--包括大量的人类人口--看不起德罗阿姆和五国的居民，但他们重视与索拉-凯尔之女的联盟，并愿意为此而遭受一些侮辱。",
	"In the Barrens, trolls often established themselves as chibs. A clever troll would gather a band of Gaa'aram orcs and dominate (and occasionally eat) a pack of goblins and kobolds, ruling a tiny fiefdom with strength and fear. This arrangement still persists in places, especially around Turakbar's Fist. Elsewhere, trolls have been drawn into the greater society of Droaam, serving in the military or performing heavy labor; those trolls who refuse to cooperate are \"sent to work at the grist mills.\" Given this, most trolls aren't too disruptive to society. However, trolls expect to be treated with respect by smaller creatures—if you're killed after you insult a troll, it's considered an unusual form of suicide, not a fault on the part of the troll.": "在荒原上，巨魔经常建立自己的奇葩地位。一个聪明的巨魔会召集一帮加阿拉姆兽人，支配（偶尔也会吃掉）一群地精和哥布林，用力量和恐惧统治一个小小的领地。这种安排在一些地方仍然存在，特别是在图拉克巴的拳头周围。在其他地方，巨魔被拉进了德罗阿姆的大社会，在军队中服役或从事重体力劳动；那些拒绝合作的巨魔被 \"送去磨坊工作\"。鉴于此，大多数巨魔都不会对社会造成太大的破坏。然而，巨魔希望得到较小生物的尊重--如果你在侮辱巨魔后被杀死，这被认为是一种不寻常的自杀形式，而不是巨魔的错。",
	"Trolls are proud of their strength, and enjoy engaging in tests of strength, like tug of war or lifting, with other trolls or ogres. While they generally dismiss smaller creatures, a troll is impressed by anyone that performs remarkable feats of strength; they generally respond better to intimidation than to diplomacy.": "巨魔对自己的力量感到自豪，并喜欢与其他巨魔或食人魔进行力量测试，如拔河或举重。虽然他们通常不理会较小的生物，但巨魔对任何表现出非凡力量的人都印象深刻；他们通常对恐吓的反应比对外交的反应更好。",
	"Like the skullcrusher ogres, the war trolls of Maenya's Fist are a unique subspecies that may be the result of magebreeding. They are utterly devoted to Sora Maenya and to Droaam.": "和碎颅食人魔一样，迈尼亚之拳的战争巨魔也是一个独特的亚种，可能是魔法繁殖的结果。他们对索拉-缅因亚和德罗阿姆完全忠诚。",

	"In the wake of the Lycanthropic Purge, many lycanthropes fled to Droaam. Most congregated in the Watching Wood under the leadership of the werewolf Zaeurl. However, there are a few independent lycanthropes scattered across the region. At the end of the Purge, the power of the curse of lycanthropy was weakened, and most of these survivors couldn't spread the curse to others; they could only pass it to their offspring. Keen to avoid any chance of further persecution, many of these renegade lycanthropes spent their lives solely in animal form. Even today, most members of the Dark Pack are born in animal form and consider it their true form. The natural lycanthropes of Droaam have the ability to speak in beast form, as worgs do, though this gift isn't passed on to creatures they afflict with lycanthropy.": "在狼人大清洗之后，许多狼人逃到了Droaam。大多数人在狼人Zaeurl的领导下聚集在守望之林。然而，也有一些独立的狼人散布在这个地区。在大清洗结束时，狼人的诅咒力量被削弱了，这些幸存者中的大多数不能将诅咒传播给其他人，他们只能将诅咒传给他们的后代。为了避免任何进一步迫害的机会，这些叛逆的狼人中有许多人只以动物的形式度过一生。即使在今天，黑暗族群的大多数成员都是以动物形态出生的，并认为这是他们的真实形态。Droaam的自然狼人有能力以兽形说话，就像虫子一样，尽管这种天赋并没有传递给被他们折磨成狼人的生物。",
	"In time, Zaeurl forged an alliance between the renegade lycanthropes and the native worgs of the Watching Wood, and this bond—the Dark Pack—remains strong to this day. However, just as there are a small number of lycanthropes with no ties to the Pack, there are worg packs scattered across Droaam. Worgs would often ally with Barrens chibs, and gnolls of the Barrakas clan often form bonds to worg companions. In general, the people of Droaam are quite comfortable with the presence of large predators, and it's polite to say {@i ta kuur}—You speak?—to a beast you've never met before.": "随着时间的推移，Zaeurl在叛变的狼人和守望森林的本地虫人之间建立了一个联盟，这种纽带--黑暗族群--至今仍很强大。然而，就像有一小部分狼人与族群没有关系一样，也有分散在Droaam的虫族族群。虫人经常会与巴伦奇布结盟，而巴拉卡斯氏族的地精也经常与虫人同伴形成联系。一般来说，德拉姆人对大型食肉动物的存在相当适应，对从未见过的野兽说{@i ta kuur}--你会说话吗--是很礼貌的。",
	"In recent years, the potency of the lycanthropic curse has returned. Under the rules of fifth edition, all lycanthropes can spread the curse, but the Daughters and Zaeurl both wish to avoid spreading lycanthropy—at least for the moment. The Dark Pack follows strict instructions—{@i don't bite unless you intend to kill.} As with trolls, most town guards understand this rule; if your friend picks a fight with a werewolf, sorry, it has to kill them after biting them; that's just a matter of public safety. Sora Katra is studying the curse of lycanthropy and may develop ways to prevent accidental contagion... or instead, she might develop a program of carefully managed infection to create a new corps of lycanthrope soldiers.": "近年来，狼人的诅咒的效力已经恢复。根据第五版的规则，所有的狼人都可以传播诅咒，但女儿们和Zaeurl都希望避免传播狼人的诅咒--至少在目前。黑暗族群遵循严格的指示--{@i don't bite unless you intend to kill.}和巨魔一样，大多数城镇守卫都明白这个规则；如果你的朋友找狼人打架，对不起，它在咬了他们之后必须杀死他们；这只是一个公共安全的问题。索拉-卡特拉正在研究狼人的诅咒，并可能开发出防止意外传染的方法......或者相反，她可能会开发一个精心管理的感染计划，以创造一个新的狼人士兵团。",
	"These are the common species of Droaam, but there are many more that could appear. Mordain the Fleshweaver unleashes strange things into the world. Manifest zones can create monstrosities. And in general, the creatures of Droaam haven't been subject to the expansion of a great nation and their subsequent extermination, unlike other regions. There may be a colony of yetis in the mountains. A lamia may rule over an ancient Dhakaani ruin. There may not be a large community of manticores, but you could easily find one living in Graywall. The Daughters of Sora Kell find a place for every creature.": "这些是Droaam的常见物种，但还有很多可能出现。编肉者莫尔丹向世界释放了奇怪的东西。表现区可以创造出怪异的东西。而且总的来说，Droaam的生物还没有像其他地区那样，受到一个大国的扩张和随后的灭绝。山中可能有一个雪人的殖民地。一个拉米亚人可能统治着一个古老的达卡尼废墟。也许没有一个大型的尾兽社区，但你可以很容易地找到一个住在灰墙的尾兽。索拉之女凯尔为每一种生物都找到了一个地方。",
	"The destruction of Stubborn and the declaration of Droaam came as a terrible shock to the people of the Five Nations. This wasn't the work of an upstart prince or an ogre chieftain. Both Sora Katra and Sora Maenya were known from countless tales—mostly terrifying ones in which things don't end well for the heroes. To most people, the Daughters were legends, figures used to scare unruly children. The Daughters were the reason you were afraid of the darkness as a child; Sora Maenya could be lurking in the shadows, waiting to add your skull to her collection. Most people of the Five Nations know nothing of the daelkyr or of the Dreaming Dark, but they know the Daughters of Sora Kell. This is one reason the Five Nations have refused to acknowledge Droaam; at the end of the day, they can't believe that it is real, and they hope that maybe they'll wake up tomorrow and realize it was all just a bad dream.": "斯特伯恩的毁灭和德罗阿姆的声明对五国人民来说是一个可怕的冲击。这不是一个新起的王子或食人魔首领所为。索拉-卡特拉和索拉-梅尼亚都是在无数的故事中为人所知的--大多数是可怕的故事，其中的英雄都没有好结果。对大多数人来说，女儿们是传说，是用来吓唬不守规矩的孩子的人物。女儿们是你小时候害怕黑暗的原因；索拉-梅尼亚可能潜伏在阴影中，等待着将你的头骨加入她的收藏。五国的大多数人对戴尔基尔或梦幻黑暗一无所知，但他们知道索拉-凯尔的女儿们。这也是五国拒绝承认Droaam的原因之一；说到底，他们无法相信这是真的，他们希望也许明天醒来会发现这一切只是一场恶梦。",
	"In principle, the Daughters of Sora Kell are hags. Sora Katra is a green hag, cunning and charismatic. Sora Maenya is an annis hag, possessed of tremendous strength and hunger. And Sora Teraza is a dusk hag, who sees the tapestry of the future laid out before her. However, calling Sora Katra a green hag is like calling a legendary bard a \"human.\" It's a foundation—a basic archetype to begin with. But all of the Daughters possess powers far beyond what's normal for hags of their type. Their mother was Sora Kell, one of thirteen immortal night hags said to have been created by Eberron and Khyber at the dawn of time. Each had a different father; in some stories these were fiends, in others, giants. Regardless, they possess inherited power, which has only increased over centuries of schemes and adventures. While the Daughters are usually spoken of together, each is a legend in her own right; they each have their own goals and distinct personality, and each one can offer different hooks for story or adventure.": "原则上，索拉-凯尔的女儿们是女巫。索拉-卡特拉是一个绿色女巫，狡猾而富有魅力。索拉-梅尼亚（Sora Maenya）是一个安尼斯巫婆，拥有巨大的力量和饥饿感。而索拉-泰拉扎是一个黄昏女巫，她能看到摆在她面前的未来织锦。然而，称索拉-泰拉为绿袍人就像称一个传奇吟游诗人为 \"人类\"。这是一个基础--开始时的基本原型。但所有的女儿们都拥有远远超出她们这种类型的女巫的正常能力。她们的母亲是索拉-凯尔，十三位不朽的夜行者之一，据说是由艾伯伦和凯伯在时间之初创造的。每个人都有一个不同的父亲；在一些故事中，这些人是恶魔，在另一些故事中，是巨人。不管怎么说，她们拥有继承的力量，这种力量在几个世纪的阴谋和冒险中只增不减。虽然女儿们通常被放在一起谈论，但每个人都有自己的传奇；她们都有自己的目标和独特的个性，每个人都可以为故事或冒险提供不同的钩子。",
	"The stories of Sora Katra are many and varied, for she's a gifted shapeshifter who seems to love meddling in the lives of heroes. She's the old woman at the inn whose idle comment sows doubt in lovers' hearts. She's the tinker who gives the farmboy the magic sword that helps him become king—the same blade he uses to kill himself in the final act. It's only through a wink to the audience or a hint to the reader that Katra's true identity is revealed. In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring {@i tragedy.}": "索拉-卡特拉的故事多种多样，因为她是一个有天赋的变形金刚，似乎喜欢插手英雄们的生活。她是旅馆里的老妇人，她的闲言碎语在恋人的心中埋下了疑惑。她是一个工匠，给了农民男孩帮助他成为国王的魔剑--也就是他在最后一幕用来自杀的那把剑。只有通过向观众眨眼或向读者暗示，卡特拉的真实身份才被揭示出来。在某些方面，这个虚构的角色与旅行者的角色重叠，但旅行者的礼物带来了混乱，而索拉-卡特拉的礼物则不可避免地带来{@i tragedy.}",
	"However, Sora Katra isn't always the villain in tales. When she acts openly, she often poses a challenge that tests the hero's wits or resolve. In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge—which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them—and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It's this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.": "然而，索拉-卡特拉并不总是故事中的反派。当她公开行动时，她经常提出挑战，考验英雄的智慧或决心。在大多数这些故事中，冠军未能应对挑战--公平地说，这通常对他们不利--灾难随之而来。但在那些罕见的情况下，主人公仍然忠于他们的理想或战胜了巫婆，她总是坚持她的承诺。正是这种测试决心和惩罚失败的嗜好催生了一个流行的故事，即如果一个孩子做出承诺并食言，索拉-卡特拉就会在夜里来到这里，拿走他们的一根手指。",
	"Sora Katra is known as a schemer. In many stories she's found weaving curses on her loom—plotting misery and misfortunes to release into the world. In the tale {@i The Sleeping Prince}, she curses the Prince of Wroat three days after his birth. In the end of the story, the Woodcutter's Daughter kills the giant in the King's Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter's Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra's motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn't kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter's Daughter—did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there's no question that Katra's actions always bring misfortune to {@i someone}—especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.": "索拉-卡特拉是一个著名的阴谋家。在许多故事中，她被发现在她的织布机上编织诅咒，策划痛苦和不幸，以释放到世界上。在故事（%0%）中，她在沃罗特王子出生三天后就对他进行了诅咒。在故事的最后，樵夫的女儿在国王的森林里杀死了巨人，并把他的舌头交给了卡特拉，当诅咒被解除后，樵夫的女儿嫁给了王子。学者们长期以来一直在争论卡特拉在这个故事中的动机。是她无法杀死巨人，而在设置一个导致巨人垮台的计划？或者，实际上她的目标从一开始就是提升樵夫的女儿--她制造障碍是为了给她选择的英雄一个崛起的机会？虽然这是一个积极的转折，但毫无疑问，卡特拉的行为总是给{@i someone}带来不幸--特别是那些未能达到她的挑战的人。",
	"Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples' anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want—such as the ambitions of her warlords—and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal—just as the prince in {@i The Sleeping Prince} was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter's Daughter. It's possible Droaam is another of her tests—but who's being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?": "索拉-卡特拉是一位出色的演说家。在故事中，她通常用她的话语来播种怀疑或不和谐，但她同样有能力将人们结合在一起，编织荣耀的梦想。在Droaam，她是女儿们的代言人，她的演讲将十几个不同的物种吸引到一起，并使突袭者和强盗们相信他们是比他们想象的更伟大、更壮观的事物的一部分。在某种程度上，这是在利用人民的愤怒和对东方人的恐惧。但她也有一个诀窍，就是简单地知道人们想要什么--比如她的军阀们的野心--并利用这一点为她服务。在泰拉扎的指导下，她预见到了问题，并总能找到人替无法避免的事情背黑锅。从某种程度上说，这就是德罗阿姆的核心之谜。为什么一开始要建立一个国家？既然泰拉扎很可能知道这一努力会失败，为什么还要寻求被《王权条约》所承认？一种可能性是，整个国家只是她实现真正目标的垫脚石--就像{@i The Sleeping Prince}中的王子是最终提升樵夫之女的工具。德罗亚姆有可能是她的另一个测试--但谁在被测试，如果他们失败了会怎样？犯罪组织Daask呢？这只是Katra的一个转移，还是Daask在推进一个神秘的议程？",
	"In her natural form, the Mistress of the Mires is a green hag, with green skin and dark green hair. However, she loves illusion and rarely remains in her true form. If she has no reason to remain in a particular form, she often shifts in mid-speech. She delights in forms with a personal impact on the people she's dealing with—taking the face of a dead lover or a betrayed friend. She possesses abilities like a powerful bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.": "在她的自然形态下，米尔斯的女主人是一个绿色的巫婆，有着绿色的皮肤和深绿色的头发。然而，她喜欢幻觉，很少保持她的真实形态。如果她没有理由保持一个特定的形态，她经常在说话的过程中转变。她乐于采用对她所面对的人有个人影响的形式--采用死去的爱人或被背叛的朋友的脸。她拥有像强大的吟游诗人一样的能力，既能鼓舞人心，又能施展强大的魔法和幻术。",
	"Sora Katra loves challenging heroes, which makes it easy to tie her to a story. Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters—she's spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince—who Katra torments, seemingly without reason—or are they the Woodcutter's Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character's backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character's family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?": "索拉-卡特拉喜欢挑战英雄，这使她很容易与一个故事联系起来。也许Droaam本身就是为了测试玩家角色而创造的--她花了十年时间，建立了一个国家，迫使角色们做出艰难的决定。如果你想在卡特拉和某个角色之间建立联系，那么这个角色是典型的沉睡的王子--卡特拉似乎毫无理由地折磨他--还是樵夫的女儿，她可能受到挑战，但最后有机会出人头地？还可以考虑一下农夫成为国王的故事。卡特拉可能会无缘无故地给一个角色一件神器；他们可以明智地使用它，还是会让他们陷入绝望？虽然与Katra的联系可以在游戏中发展，但你可以在角色的背景故事中建立与Mires女主人的联系。也许Katra因为他们的父母所做的事情而诅咒了这个角色的家庭；这个角色是否可以做一些事情来解除诅咒？或者，当他们还是孩子的时候，角色无意中为伪装的卡特拉做了一件事，而她承诺会报答这一善举；角色将在什么时候以及如何报答这一恩情？",
	"Sora Maenya is often depicted as a monster, said to wander the Towering Wood. She is known for her strength and her endless appetite; it's commonly said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. Stories often depict her through her absence, as an unstoppable force that punishes arrogance or cruelty. The shepherd warns the foolish farmers not to settle in the forbidden meadow; later, he returns to find their bones picked clean and stacked near the hearth, but without their skulls. There's no need to say who it was or to show the battle. The tale notes the missing skulls, and everyone knows that Maenya keeps the skulls of her victims, binding their souls to the bone and using them as lanterns.": "索拉-马恩雅经常被描绘成一个怪物，据说她在高耸的森林里游荡。她以她的力量和无尽的食欲而闻名；通常说她可以徒手捏碎一个巨人，然后把整个东西吃掉，但仍然很饿。故事经常通过她的缺席来描绘她，作为一种不可阻挡的力量来惩罚傲慢或残忍的行为。牧羊人警告那些愚蠢的农民不要在禁忌的草地上定居；后来，他回来发现他们的骨头被挑干净，堆在壁炉附近，但没有头骨。没有必要说是谁，也没有必要展示战斗的过程。这个故事注意到了失踪的头骨，每个人都知道马恩雅保存着她的受害者的头骨，把他们的灵魂绑在骨头上并把它们当作灯笼。",
	"Maenya greatly enjoys games and challenges, and she may spare someone who shows spirit. While she doesn't lay out schemes as complex as does Sora Katra, there are many tales of Maenya wandering the woods in disguise and tricking travelers into unwise contests. Her endless appetite reflects a broad love of life; it's not simply that she's hungry, it's that she loves to eat. She fights for the sheer joy that comes in crushing an enemy, and in the folk song {@i Edar's Last Jig}, she dances until her partner dies of exhaustion. She seems to have a sense of humor, albeit a morbid one; she may spare someone who makes her laugh, or let someone live because it amuses her to do so. There are stories where a hero beats her in a seemingly impossible contest through cunning and courage; when defeated, she honors any promise she has made. However, a victor would be wise not to gloat; in the tales, this is a sure path to an unexpected end.": "玛妮雅非常喜欢游戏和挑战，她可能会放过那些表现出精神的人。虽然她不像索拉-卡特拉那样制定复杂的计划，但有许多关于玛妮雅乔装打扮在森林中游荡，欺骗旅行者参加不明智比赛的故事。她无穷无尽的食欲反映了她对生活的广泛热爱；这不仅仅是她饿了，而是她喜欢吃。她为粉碎敌人的纯粹的快乐而战斗，在民歌中（%0%），她跳舞直到她的伙伴精疲力竭而死。她似乎有一种幽默感，尽管是一种病态的幽默感；她可能会放过一个让她发笑的人，或者让一个人活着，因为这样做会让她感到高兴。在一些故事中，英雄通过狡猾和勇气在一场看似不可能的比赛中击败了她；当被击败时，她会履行自己的任何承诺。然而，胜利者最好不要幸灾乐祸；在故事中，这肯定会导致意外的结局。",
	"Sora Maenya is the general of Droaam's armies, the iron fist that crushes any rebellion. The core of her power is Maenya's Fist, an elite corps of war trolls and skullcrusher ogres. Everything about the Fist is shrouded in mystery. Some say Maenya bred and trained them in a buried Dhakaani fortress; others say that Maenya herself forged the imposing plate armor that they wear. Whatever the truth, the members of the Fist are fanatically devoted to Maenya. While Droaam has yet to assemble an army combining the full force of its warlords, thus far, Maenya has shown herself to be a brilliant and unorthodox strategist, one not to be underestimated.": "索拉-梅尼亚是德罗阿姆军队的将军，是粉碎任何叛乱的铁拳。她权力的核心是玛尼亚之拳，这是一支由战争巨魔和碎颅食人魔组成的精英队伍。关于拳头的一切都被笼罩在神秘的气氛中。有人说玛尼亚在一个被掩埋的达卡尼堡垒中培养和训练他们；还有人说玛尼亚亲自铸造了他们身上的气派的板甲。无论真相如何，拳头的成员都狂热地献身于玛尼亚。虽然德罗阿姆还没有组建一支结合了其军阀全部力量的军队，但到目前为止，玛茵雅已经显示出她是一个出色的、非正统的战略家，不容小觑。",
	"In her natural form, Sora Maenya is an annis hag—a towering, powerful figure. She can assume smaller forms, but rarely seeks to play psychological games with her shapeshifting as Katra does. She appears in many tales as a hungry woman—tall and thin, with ragged clothing and long black hair, seeking shelter and food. While her primary power is her martial might, she does have supernatural gifts; the most infamous is her soulbinding. And perhaps she also has other necromantic skills that haven't been revealed in the tales...": "在她的自然形态下，索拉-马恩雅是一个安尼斯女巫--一个高大、强大的形象。她可以变成较小的形态，但很少像卡特拉那样试图用她的变形术来玩心理游戏。在许多故事中，她都是以一个饥饿的女人的形象出现的--又高又瘦，衣衫褴褛，黑色长发，寻找住所和食物。虽然她的主要力量是她的武功，但她确实有超自然的天赋；最臭名昭著的是她的灵魂束缚。也许她还有其他的亡灵技能，但在故事中并没有被揭示出来......",
	"While she's known for her immense strength, Sora Maenya isn't just a brute; there are stories in which she actually trains a hero, either teaching them to fight or granting them unnatural strength. While it would be an unusual path, a monk or barbarian could attribute their class features to early training with Sora Maenya. The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain—asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she'll come to collect. Or perhaps it's the other way around; perhaps as a child, the character defeated Maenya at a game, and it's she who owes the character a favor.": "虽然她以巨大的力量而闻名，但索拉-梅尼亚并不只是一个蛮人；在一些故事中，她实际上是在训练一个英雄，要么教他们战斗，要么赋予他们非自然的力量。虽然这将是一条不寻常的道路，但僧侣或野蛮人可以把他们的等级特征归结为早期与索拉-马恩雅的训练。问题是当她教他们的时候，他们是否知道她的身份；她是森林里的Reaver，还是她以一种假想的形式教他们？如果一个角色来自Eldeen Reaches，他们是否会在童年时遇到Sora Maenya？也许他们离家出走，在他们离开的时候，玛恩雅吞噬了他们的村庄。或者他们做了一个不明智的交易--要求索拉-玛恩雅杀死一个童年时的对手，她做到了；现在这个角色欠她一笔债，有一天她会来讨债。也可能是相反的情况；也许在小时候，这个角色在一场比赛中打败了马恩雅，是她欠了这个角色一个人情。",
	"One thing that makes the Daughters interesting is that they aren't simply mundane tyrants or warlords. They're legends, and have matched wits with countless heroes. One way to reflect this is to provide them with powers that aren't easily represented or replicated by the standard rules of play. For example, when a character is negotiating with Sora Katra, the DM might ask the player, \"Tell me a time in your childhood when you broke a promise.\" Sora Katra might then bring that story up: \"I watched you through your window that night, warrior. I chose not to take your finger then, for I'd had my fill that evening. But why should I trust you today, when you broke your word to your childhood friend?\"": "使女儿们变得有趣的一点是，他们并不是简单的世俗暴君或军阀。他们是传奇人物，曾与无数的英雄们斗智斗勇。反映这一点的一个方法是为他们提供不容易被标准游戏规则所代表或复制的权力。例如，当一个角色与索拉-卡特拉谈判时，管理员可能会问玩家：\"告诉我在你的童年时代，你有一次违背了承诺。\" 然后索拉-卡特拉可能会提起这个故事。\"那晚我透过你的窗户看着你，勇士。我当时选择不接受你的手指，因为那天晚上我已经吃饱了。但今天我为什么要相信你，因为你对你的童年朋友食言了？\"",
	"There's no saving throw against this and no mechanical effect. It simply demonstrates that Katra has powers and influence that can't be measured or fully defined. Perhaps she's using some form of telepathy and the whole thing's a con. Or perhaps she was there that night. The point is that she's not just a powerful bard; no one knows exactly what she can do. Likewise with Teraza's visions, or the idea that Katra can weave curses on her loom—like eldritch machines, the limit on these abilities is whatever the story needs them to be.": "对这个没有救赎，也没有机械效应。这只是表明卡特拉拥有无法测量或完全定义的力量和影响。也许她使用了某种形式的心灵感应，整个事情是一个骗局。也可能她那晚就在那里。关键是，她不仅仅是一个强大的吟游诗人；没有人知道她到底能做什么。同样，泰拉扎的幻觉，或者卡特拉可以在她的织布机上编织诅咒的想法，这些能力的极限是故事需要的。",
	"In many ways, the Daughters feel like characters pulled out of faerie tales, and the DM could draw inspiration from elements of Thelanis from chapter 5 (such as curses). But the Daughters are natives of Eberron, not archfey from Thelanis. As such, the Daughters are extremely powerful and long-lived, but they're ultimately mortal; they should be very difficult to kill, but they can die. In addition, archfey largely cannot change, and continue to play out the same story indefinitely. The Daughters are part of Eberron, and as shown by Droaam itself, they may have their preferred themes, but they can create entirely new stories.": "在许多方面，女儿们感觉像是从精灵故事中抽出的角色，DM可以从第五章的Thelanis元素中获取灵感（比如诅咒）。但女儿们是Eberron的本地人，而不是Thelanis的大法官。因此，女儿们非常强大且长寿，但她们终究是凡人；她们应该很难被杀死，但她们会死。此外，大恶魔在很大程度上不能改变，并继续无限期地演绎着同一个故事。女儿们是Eberron的一部分，正如Droaam本身所示，她们可能有自己喜欢的主题，但她们可以创造全新的故事。",
	"Sora Teraza is the most enigmatic of the Daughters of Sora Kell. She's known to be blind, yet she's perfectly aware of her surroundings; it's not that she can see, she simply {@i knows} where everything is. In some tales, it's said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It's also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people—books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.": "索拉-特拉扎是索拉-凯尔的女儿中最神秘的一个。众所周知，她是个盲人，但她完全了解她的周围环境；这并不是说她能看见，她只是{@i knows}知道所有东西在哪里。在一些故事中，据说她知道每个人什么时候会死；在其他故事中，她自己选择每个人的死亡时间。还有人说，她有一个图书馆，里面保存着记录杰出人物生活的书籍--这些书籍包含了那些英雄的灵魂，当那个冠军接近死亡时，她就会出现收集灵魂。",
	"Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she's not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn't always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge—that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn't actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn't as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.": "索拉-泰拉扎是一个黄昏的巫婆。虽然她可以改变自己的形状，但她很少这样做；她穿着一件破旧的长袍，把她的脸藏在一个深深的头罩下面。她很少说话，除了发布隐晦的声明之外。当她不和她的姐妹们在一起时，她会把时间花在打理她在大峭壁上的图书馆，或者冥想中。泰拉扎无疑是这个时代最有天赋的神谕。这可能与德拉贡的预言有关，也可能是她以一种不同的方式感知未来。当然，泰拉扎从未被描述为必须寻求她的答案；似乎她只是知道它们。鉴于这种准确无误的知识，女儿们似乎不可能失败；她可以揭示他们敌人的计划和他们可能寻找的任何宝藏的位置。但是泰拉扎并不总是分享她的知识，不为她的姐妹们的最佳利益行事，甚至不为她自己的利益行事。为什么不呢？最简单的答案是她精神不正常；任何思想都可能被这种知识的负担所打破。一个更复杂的可能性是，她被自己的知识所困--她已经知道自己要做什么，实际上没有任何真正的自由意志。或者，她的知识并不像表面上那样绝对：她有可能知道任何事情，但有些事情只是躲避了她的视线。",
	"Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there's an Aundairian war criminal—a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for—hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart—leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information—via {@spell dream} or {@spell sending}—that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn't mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza's knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it's a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it.": "不管怎么说，Sora Teraza当然可以，有时也会警告她的姐妹们可能的威胁，如奸诈的军阀或接近的玩家角色，并指导他们走最好的道路以确保胜利。但她也可以保持沉默，或者只在别人认为有用的时候才提供信息。例如，她可以透露有一个Aundairian的战争罪犯--一个有巨大技能的巫师，Sora Katra肯定会有用武之地--藏匿在灰墙中。但她可能会在他到达一年后才提供这一信息，而且是在他计划离开的前一天--这使得卡特拉只有24小时的时间来动员特工，试图抓住这个巫师。这些特工将与玩家角色竞争，还是他们将成为玩家角色？泰拉扎也可能为一个角色提供一个神秘的信息--通过{@spell dream}或{@spell sending}--这可能非常有用，即使这可能会伤害她的姐妹们。这并不意味着她背叛了她的姐妹们；这只是她在必须做的时候做了她必须做的事。虽然Sora Teraza的知识可能是无限的，但在实践中，它是推动一个有趣故事的工具，而不是破坏它。",
	"Droaam is a wild frontier filled with monsters. It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common races of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can't tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It's an opportunity to make bargains you couldn't make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don't exist elsewhere.": "Droaam是一个充满了怪物的野生边境。它站在五国的法律之外。东方的普通种族在这里是局外人，不受待见。为什么明智的冒险家会去这个危险的地方？最简单的答案是，它提供了你在其他地方无法讲述的故事的机会，正是因为它超越了五国的法律。这是一个你可以与霍尔韦尔其他地方的生物互动的地方，一个探索这些生物在不只是吃冒险者或坐在成堆的金子上时能用他们的超自然天赋做什么的机会。这是一个机会，你可以在其他地方做不到的交易，也可以找到其他地方没有的冒险。",
	"The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation—even if Droaam isn't currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don't easily translate to low-level play—there's no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll—it's easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents new racial traits for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you're from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?": "索拉-凯尔的女儿们可以作为冒险者队伍的团体赞助人，如（%0%）所述。这支队伍可能是达斯克的代理人，而达斯克在德罗阿姆之外被认为是一个犯罪组织。但女儿们是国家元首，人物也可以是国家的合法特使--即使Droaam目前不被承认为合法国家。这对玩家来说是一个创建畸形角色团队的好机会。虽然有些生物不容易转化为低级游戏--没有简单的方法来制作一级战争巨魔--但玩兽人、移居者、变异者、哥布林、哥布林和牛头人很容易。此外，第6章介绍了创建地精角色的新种族特性。在创建一个怪物角色时，要考虑你是来自新的混合城市之一，还是来自旧的飞地；你的第一忠诚是对索拉-凯尔的女儿，还是对你的个人军阀？你是否渴望自己成为一个军阀？",
	"As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.": "作为Droaam的代理人，冒险者可以被派去执行女儿们的个人任务：也许是调查一个有可能导致起义的谜团，处理一个叛乱的军阀，或者从达卡尼废墟中恢复一件重要的文物。或者他们可以在更广阔的世界中充当特使，无论是与可能的盟友谈判，还是简单地充当亲善大使，向人们展示怪兽之国不需要被恐惧。",
	"There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam—perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon's blood and blood gin; it's also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon's blood, but to find out exactly who's creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.": "有许多不寻常的物品只能在德拉姆找到--也许一个工匠需要巴斯里斯克眼睛来完成他们最新的发明。德罗亚姆也是一些奇怪的炼金术混合物的唯一来源，比如龙血和血琴；也有可能五国的人物被派到德罗亚姆不是为了获得龙血，而是为了找出到底是谁在制造龙血以及如何制造。德罗亚姆也是一个可以与黑暗六神的强大牧师公开交流的地方；如果冒险者需要守护者的高级牧师的帮助，灰墙可能是最近和最快捷的选择。",
	"Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they're haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be legendary treasures hidden in the depths.": "德罗亚姆有大量的达卡尼遗迹，尚未被莫格莱夫探险家的贪婪之手所触及。在某些情况下，这些遗迹之所以没有被破坏，是因为它们被鬼魂缠身，被扭曲的畸形物侵扰，或者被野生怪兽或其他怪物占据，比如生活在卡扎克德拉尔的梅杜莎人。灰墙（Graywall）和大峭壁（Great Crag）都建在达卡尼（Dhakaani）废墟之上，无论冒险者是在寻找失落的达尔（Dar）神器还是可怕的达尔（Daelkyr）工具，深处都可能隐藏着传奇般的宝藏。",
	"The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa'vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region's goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?": "达尔凯尔-奥拉斯克（daelkyr Orlaask）曾在这个地区活动，在卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）和苏塔-德拉尔（Suthar Draal）下面有通往其半位面监狱的通道。腐蚀者迪尔恩（Dyrrn）也参与了这个地区的古代战争。根据一些说法，Dyrrn正是在这里释放了被称为 \"Kapaa'vola \"的传染性诅咒（在本章后面讨论），这也是为什么该地区的妖精与达尔古尔人和凯奇达卡安人如此不同的原因；能否在这里找到解除诅咒的关键？",
	"Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations—especially Aundair—might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel {@i The Queen of Stone} covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.": "布雷兰担心德罗阿姆正准备对其西部边境进行大规模攻击。其他国家--尤其是昂代尔--可能会鼓励这样的行动。索拉-凯尔的女儿们可以重复他们的要求，要求得到承认；《艾伯伦》小说（%0%）涵盖了这样一次峰会。同时，所有有龙纹的家族都对德罗安可能存在的商业机会感兴趣。这些利益集团中的任何一个都可以带着一队冒险者去德罗安，无论他们是作为间谍还是作为使节公开工作。",
	"Droaam—and Graywall in particular—is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It's a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it's a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It's the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.": "Droaam--尤其是灰墙--是持不同政见者、逃兵、强盗和战犯的共同目的地。这是一个成长中的城市，不受五国法律的约束。虽然它是一个怪物之城，但它有一个繁荣的外国区，是塔拉什克家族的主要飞地和越来越多的龙纹前哨的所在地。这是一个完美的藏身之所，一群冒险者可能被雇来从德拉姆（Droaam）找回某人，或者在事情上有更多个人利益。",
	"A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?": "一个在沙恩的计划失败的恶棍可以逃到灰墙；人物有多想报仇？或者，冒险者们可以了解到在更遥远的过去起作用的人的位置：最后一次战争中的老敌人，对战友的死亡或家乡的毁灭负责的人。他们是在寻找一个对无数平民死亡负责的昂代尔战争法师，还是一个试图刺杀博拉内尔国王的布雷利什贵族？另外，人物可能会发现一个老朋友躲在灰墙，但他们被一个强大的敌人盯上了；冒险者们能及时赶到他们身边帮忙吗？",
	"There have always been gnoll clans in the Barrens, though the Dhakaani goblins ruthlessly exterminated gnolls in imperial territories, driving them back into the wilds. But their story starts long before. In the dawn of time, Eberron was the domain of the fiendish overlords. This was an age of chaos, as the overlords constantly clashed with one another. {@creature Rak Tulkesh|ERLW}, the Rage of War, commanded armies of fiends, while the Wild Heart raised hordes of ravenous beasts. In the struggles between the two, the Wild Heart bred dire hyenas with the ability to consume the immortal essences of the Zakya warriors of Rak Tulkhesh. But the Wild Heart failed to anticipate how consuming fiends would affect its creations. Twisted from within by the immortal essence of the demons they'd devoured, the hyenas were warped into something entirely new, something that was neither beast nor demon: and so the first gnolls were born.": "荒原上一直有地精氏族，尽管达卡尼地精无情地消灭了帝国领土上的地精，把他们赶回了荒野。但他们的故事要从很久以前说起。在时间的黎明，艾伯伦是恶魔般的霸主的领地。这是一个混乱的时代，因为霸主们不断地相互冲突。(战争之怒（%0%）指挥着恶魔大军，而狂野之心则养育着成群的贪婪的野兽。在两者之间的斗争中，野性之心培育了可怕的鬣狗，有能力吞噬拉克图尔赫什的扎基亚战士的不朽精华。但野性之心没有预料到吞噬魔族会如何影响其创造物。鬣狗被它们吞噬的恶魔的不朽精华从内部扭曲，被扭曲成一种全新的东西，一种既不是野兽也不是恶魔的东西：于是，第一批地精诞生了。",
	"Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns. The fiendish spark burned within them, and when they weren't directly serving the Lords of Dust, most engaged in vicious acts of brutality. The Rage of War seeks endless battle, and when there is no greater conflict, it delights in setting its minions against one another. For countless generations, gnolls fought troll, ogre, and other gnolls seeking blood for their hungry idols.": "地精由战争和野性组成，被拉克-图尔克什和野性之心招募和培育。作为霸主的步兵，他们与兽人和其他早期人类作战，同时也与其他霸主的地精氏族作战。即使在霸主被打败并被银色火焰束缚之后，地精仍然是他们的棋子。邪恶的火花在他们体内燃烧，当他们不直接为尘土领主服务时，大多数人都从事着恶毒的暴行。战争之怒寻求无休止的战斗，当没有更大的冲突时，它乐于让它的奴仆们彼此对抗。无数代以来，地精与巨魔、食人魔和其他地精战斗，为他们饥饿的偶像寻求鲜血。",
	"Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin—then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as {@i Znir}—a word that simply means \"stone\"—and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one—not chib, god, or demon—to hold dominion over them.": "然后，几个世纪前，两个来自敌对部族的地精在浸透了他们亲属鲜血的战场上互相对峙，然后质疑导致他们的道路。这两个人劝说其他人拒绝那些要求无休止战争的声音，拒绝为恶魔服务而追逐死亡。两个人变成了四个人，然后是八个人，直到整个部族都听从了这个呼吁。族长们把他们的神像拖到现在被称为（%0%）的地方--这个词的意思是 \"石头\"--在那里，他们打碎了他们曾经服务的恶魔的形象。聚集在一起的猎人、巫师和战士们一起宣誓。他们可能是许多部族，但从今天起，他们将是一个族群。他们不允许任何人--无论是巫师、神还是恶魔--对他们进行统治。",
	"This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even just holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all of the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact.": "这说起来容易，做起来难。与内部的恶魔影响作斗争已经很有挑战性了，但荒原是一个混乱的战斗力量的织锦。新成立的兹尼尔盟约的领导人并不希望统治其他生物，但即使只是持有领土也会招致攻击。因此，他们制定了一条至今仍在前进的道路：雇佣兵之路。地精不会在兹尼尔周围的土地上要求任何领土。他们将为任何愿意支付公平价格的人而战。但如果有人试图奴役地精，或对兹尼尔本身发动攻击，他们将面临所有联合部族的愤怒。这是一个必须多次讲授的课程，但在一个多世纪后，这一点已经得到了验证。对那些付钱给他们的人来说，地精就像石头一样可靠。那些背叛他们或挑衅的人将在整个契约的威力面前倒下。",
	"Some scholars of the Five Nations find it strange that the Znir Pact never took the path of conquest. There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally—to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles—but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.": "一些研究五国的学者发现，兹尼尔盟约从未走上征服的道路，这很奇怪。在这个地区内，没有与盟约的联合力量相提并论的，他们本可以打败他们所服务的各种奇葩和军阀。但地精从来没有统治其他生物的愿望；他们喜欢狩猎和战斗的快感。契约之路允许他们做自然而然的事--跟踪和杀戮，进行无休止的战斗--但他们是一起做的。他们选择了他们所遵循的道路和他们所进行的战斗。人们可以看一下契约者，说他们为许多主人服务。但兹尼尔地精会回答说，他们只为自己服务：他们选择为谁而战，他们设定服务的条件。",
	"The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan's moon.": "兹尼尔地精包括十几个不同的部族，每个部族都拥有独特的传统。曾几何时，这些部族都献给了不同面孔的统治者，但当他们打碎了自己的雕像后，每个部族都选择了其中一个月亮。所有的地精都能熟练地打猎和战斗，但巴拉卡人被称为盟约中最优秀的追踪者；阿里特人是最致命的弓箭手；奥拉鲁恩人是最强壮的战士和最有力的先锋队。通常情况下，雇佣兵部队由单一部族的地精组成，根据未来任务的性质进行分配，合同通常是根据部族的月亮周期来协商期限的。",
	"The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls—though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.": "各部族在Znir地区保持着不同的领地，但任何部族的壁炉周围都欢迎所有的地精；Znir人努力粉碎部族之间出现的任何紧张关系。每个部族的巫师和领导人都在Znir的破碎神像周围维持一个议会。他们在这里调解争端，将合同分配给各部族，并分配资金和设备。艾尔部族磨练了他们作为铁匠和制革师的技能，他们制作了许多兹尼尔地精使用的设备--尽管兹尼尔人中仍有强烈的搜刮传统，而且战士们经常要求从倒下的敌人身上获得战利品。",
	"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Znir simply refuse to allow the demon within to hold dominion over them. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence—to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return.": "Znir人在粉碎他们的雕像时反抗了霸主，但每个地精的血液中仍有恶魔的火花。兹尼尔人只是拒绝让内心的恶魔主宰他们。年轻的地精学会了如何抵制这种影响--引导恶魔的力量，而不给它支配自己的权力。对大多数地精来说，这是一个纪律问题；兹尼尔地精以面对挑衅时保持冷静而著称，在学会与自己的恶魔斗争后，他们不容易被凡人所操纵。然而，有些地精学会利用他们的非自然遗产，并以有用的方式引导这种力量。兹尼尔地精有他们自己的游侠和野蛮人的对应物；游侠的原始魔法来自野性之心，而野蛮人则引导战争之怒的愤怒。兹尼尔萨满与术士类似，通常遵循恶魔之路。然而，在所有这些例子中，Znir人并不为黑暗力量服务。相反，他们可以被视为从黑暗力量中窃取力量；学会利用它而不给予任何回报。",
	"In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as {@i hwyri}—Gnoll for \"warden\"—and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats. There has been some tension between the Vult and the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack; the Vult shamans suspect that the Pack is vulnerable to the influence of the Wild Heart.": "为了不让恶魔的力量支配他们的人民，兹尼尔地精也发展了他们自己的技术来对抗超自然的威胁。被训练来面对恶魔和亡灵的冠军被称为{@i hwyri}--格诺尔人的 \"守护者\"--并拥有与其他国家的圣骑士类似的力量。然而，Hwyri并不崇拜任何神圣的力量。他们的能力来自于对恶魔的训练和理解；他们不是十字军，而是雇佣军的恶魔猎人。大多数hwyri来自Vult氏族，在一个回避银色火焰的土地上，这些地精可能是人们面对恶魔威胁的最佳希望。沃特族和黑暗族群的狼人之间一直存在着一些紧张关系；沃特族的巫师们怀疑，黑暗族群容易受到野心的影响。",
	"So as a gnoll, there is a spark of demonic influence within you. The Znir learn to control this at an early age. But how does it manifest in you? Do you suppress it completely, or do you channel it in some way—possibly reflected by your class abilities? Are you a hwyri who seeks to fight supernatural threats, or are you not concerned with such things?": "因此，作为一个地精，你体内有一个恶魔影响的火花。兹尼尔人在很小的时候就学会了控制它。但它是如何在你身上表现出来的呢？你是完全压制它，还是以某种方式引导它--可能反映在你的等级能力上？你是一个寻求与超自然威胁作斗争的巫师，还是对这种事情不关心？",
	"As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. With this in mind, the Eyre clan produces a weapon they call the {@i myrnaxe}, named for the smith who created it. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axeblade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Functionally, a myrnaxe is a battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either slashing damage (with the axe blade) or piercing damage (with the spear). It's common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk—thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes.": "作为怪物之乡的雇佣兵，兹尼尔地精准备面对各种各样的异国对手。考虑到这一点，Eyre氏族生产了一种他们称之为（%0%）的武器，以创造它的铁匠命名。myrnaxe有一个坚固的木柄，一端是弯曲的斧刃，另一端是长矛头。从功能上讲，米尔纳克斯是一把战斧，但它可以用来造成砍伤（用斧刃）或刺伤（用矛）。常见的情况是，每个头都由不同的金属制成，因此矛头可能是银的，而斧刃是由byeshk制成的--这样可以最大限度地发挥其对付多种敌人的多功能性。",
	"The Znir consider the myrnaxe a signature weapon of their pact and don't sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a myrnaxe is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.": "兹尼尔人认为myrnaxe是他们契约的标志性武器，不向外人出售。获得myrnaxe的唯一途径是被给予或从一个倒下的敌人那里得到它。",
	"Droaam is a small place, and the Znir serve any who will pay a fair price. This inevitably leads to conflict between Znir gnolls fighting for two opposing sides. In such situations, Znir fight one another with all their skill, but they strike to wound, not kill. A gnoll wounded by another gnoll immediately withdraws from battle, no matter how superficial the wound. While some clients take umbrage at this—\"You can still fight! Get back out there!\"—this is an absolute rule of all Znir contracts, and gnolls who defy this are punished by the united clans.": "德罗亚姆是一个小地方，兹尼尔人为任何愿意支付公平价格的人服务。这不可避免地导致了为两个对立面作战的兹尼尔地精之间的冲突。在这种情况下，兹尼尔人用他们所有的技巧互相厮杀，但他们的攻击是为了受伤，而不是杀人。被另一个地精打伤的地精会立即退出战斗，无论伤口有多浅薄。虽然有些客户对此表示不满--\"你还能战斗！回去吧！回到那里去！\"这是所有Znir合同的一个绝对规则，违抗这一点的地精会受到联合部族的惩罚。",
	"While Droaam has risen around them, the Znir Pact continues as it always has. They don't work for shelter and grist, and expect to be paid for their service. This is perfectly acceptable to the Daughters of Sora Kell, who have placed a full half of the Pact forces on extended retainer. Most large communities have a Znir garrison employed by the Daughters. These troops are present to protect the region from brigands or invaders, and to help maintain order. But they serve the Daughters, not the local chib; it's understood that if the chib or their warlord turns against the Daughters, the local Znir will act against them. The remainder of the Pact serves other masters, and many warlords of chibs employ Znir gnolls as bodyguards, enforcers, or hunters.": "当德罗阿姆在他们周围崛起的时候，兹尼尔盟约却一如既往地在继续。他们不为住所和草料工作，并期望为他们的服务获得报酬。这对于索拉-凯尔的女儿们来说是完全可以接受的，她们已经将整整一半的契约军置于长期的雇佣关系之下。大多数大型社区都有一支由女儿们雇用的兹尼尔驻军。这些部队的存在是为了保护该地区免受强盗或入侵者的侵害，并帮助维持秩序。但他们是为女儿会服务的，而不是为当地的奇布服务的；大家都知道，如果奇布或他们的军阀背叛女儿会，当地的兹尼尔人就会对他们采取行动。契约的其余部分为其他主人服务，许多奇布的军阀雇用兹尼尔地精作为保镖、执法者或猎人。",
	"The Znir take their contracts seriously. If the client breaks the terms of the agreement, the contract immediately ends; but as long as terms are met, Znir will face any danger and never betray a client. They have earned this reputation over the course of centuries, and this gives them a place much like the Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith in Khorvaire; everyone knows that the word of the Znir is as unbreakable as stone.": "Znir人认真对待他们的合同。如果客户违反了协议条款，合同立即终止；但只要条款得到满足，Znir会面对任何危险，从不背叛客户。他们在几个世纪的时间里赢得了这种声誉，这使他们的地位很像霍尔韦尔的迪尼斯家族的哨兵元帅；所有人都知道，兹尼尔人的话语像石头一样牢不可破。",
	"House Tharashk has begun brokering the services of Znir gnolls within the Five Nations, but the Pact leaders are cautious about this arrangement. Within Droaam, Znir customs are known and respected, and the Znir can unite against anyone who defies them. The Znir recognize that they don't hold such power over the rulers of the Five Nations, and are concerned about serving so far from their stones. In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world. This scouting role is a reasonable path for a gnoll player character; it's their job to travel the world beyond and learn its ways, and to make friends and allies.": "塔拉什克家族已经开始在五国境内为兹尼尔地精提供中介服务，但公约领导人对这种安排持谨慎态度。在德罗阿姆，兹尼尔人的习俗是众所周知的，并且受到尊重，兹尼尔人可以联合起来反对任何违抗他们的人。兹尼尔人认识到他们对五国的统治者并不拥有这样的权力，并对在离他们的石头这么远的地方服务感到担忧。除了那些通过塔拉什克家族或达斯克家族服务的人之外，一些兹尼尔人被派往东部研究五国，收集关于五国人民和习俗的知识，以便兹尼尔议会能够决定如何与更广泛的世界接触。对于一个地精玩家角色来说，这种侦察的角色是一个合理的途径；他们的工作是游历外面的世界，学习它的方式，并结交朋友和盟友。",
	"Here are some common characteristics of gnolls—some of them biological, others cultural—that can help make a Znir character come alive.": "这里有一些地精的共同特征--有些是生物性的，有些是文化性的--可以帮助使兹尼尔角色变得生动。",
	"A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on clan, this can be uniform in color, or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green, and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of the gnoll sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don't grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation.": "一个典型的地精身高超过7英尺，但他们驼背的姿势掩盖了这一点。雄性和雌性的外观相似，其他物种很难将它们区分开来。地精身体上有厚厚的皮毛；根据不同的部族，皮毛的颜色可以是统一的，也可以是由斑点或条纹组成的。它们的眼睛是黄色或绿色的，在反射光下闪闪发光。虽然这些都是常见的特征，但地精的恶魔血统有时也表现在其外表上。一个不寻常的地精可能有发光的红眼睛，有像火焰一样发光的条纹的皮毛，或者其他不寻常的特征。通常情况下，这些并不赋予特殊的能力，尽管你可以为这样的突变赋予一个等级能力或特技。",
	"Gnolls possess powerful jaws, as reflected by their bite attack. They can chew through and digest bone, and dislike letting food go to waste. When feral gnolls raid a village, they consume even the bones of their victims. Znir gnolls won't eat their fallen foes if they're in the company of creatures who are uncomfortable with such behavior. But they often eat a small piece of any creature they slay—even if it's just a finger—to form a bond with the victim. The Znir believe that those you kill wait for you in the realm of death, and honoring them ensures that they won't be hungry when you travel to that land.": "地精拥有强大的下颚，这从它们的咬合攻击中可以看出。它们可以咀嚼和消化骨头，并且不喜欢让食物浪费掉。当野蛮的地精袭击一个村庄时，它们甚至会吃掉受害者的骨头。如果他们与那些对这种行为感到不舒服的生物在一起，兹尼尔地精就不会吃他们倒下的敌人。但他们经常吃他们杀死的任何生物的一小块--即使只是一根手指，以形成与受害者的联系。兹尼尔人相信，你所杀的人在死亡之境中等待着你，而尊敬他们可以确保他们在你前往那片土地时不会感到饥饿。",
	"Gnolls have very strong pack instincts. They instinctively work together in combat, and think nothing of placing themselves in harm's way to protect their kin. Znir gnolls won't deceive members of their pack; if there are problems, they call them out directly. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters—but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don't show them the same respect.": "地精有非常强烈的群体本能。它们在战斗中本能地合作，并且不惜牺牲自己来保护自己的亲属。兹尼尔地精不会欺骗他们族群的成员；如果有问题，他们会直接叫出来。如果一个地精角色收养了一群冒险者作为他们的临时族群，这些事情也适用于其他角色--但如果他们的非地精族群伙伴没有对他们表示同样的尊重，地精会感到惊讶和愤怒。",
	"Gnolls often seem very aggressive to other creatures. However, gnolls themselves don't consider casual intimidation to be a hostile act; it's just a way to establish a place in the hierarchy of the pack, largely ignored once that hierarchy is established. This manifests in how gnolls make demands rather than requests, and use active statements rather than passive queries.": "地精对其他生物来说常常显得非常具有攻击性。然而，地精自己并不认为随意的恐吓是一种敌对行为；它只是一种在群体的等级制度中确立地位的方式，一旦这种等级制度确立，基本上就被忽略了。这表现在地精如何提出要求而不是请求，使用主动陈述而不是被动询问。",
	"Gnolls are strong and aggressive by nature. But both the Znir gnolls and their uncivilized kin are cunning hunters rather than simple brutes. Gnolls work together as a pack, always searching for weaknesses in enemies and supporting injured allies. Znir goals won't break their word, but they don't hold to any idea of honorable conduct on the battlefield; they are ruthless and efficient, and see nothing wrong with ambushing or tricking a superior foe. Some gnolls have a supernatural knack for mimicry (which could be represented by the use of {@spell minor illusion} or the {@feat Actor} feat) and use this gift to draw enemies into danger.": "地精的天性是强壮和好斗。但无论是Znir地精还是他们未开化的亲属，都是狡猾的猎人，而不是简单的畜生。地精作为一个群体一起工作，总是寻找敌人的弱点，支持受伤的盟友。兹尼尔人的目标是不会食言的，但他们在战场上并不坚持任何光荣的行为理念；他们无情而高效，认为埋伏或欺骗优势敌人没有错。一些地精有超自然的模仿技巧（可以用{@spell minor illusion}或{@feat Actor}的特技来表示），并利用这种天赋将敌人引入危险。",
	"Droaam is a diverse region, and the Znir gnolls have always been prepared to work for any master. They don't judge people by appearance or by their beliefs; just as they put up with demon-worshiping minotaurs in Droaam, a Znir hwyri can work alongside a templar of the Silver Flame or a warforged paladin of Dol Arrah. They may not like the people they are working with, and they may think that the beliefs of their companions are vile or foolish. But they place duty before such personal concerns, and won't insult allies or pick fights with them.": "Droaam是一个多元化的地区，Znir地精一直准备为任何主人工作。他们不以外表或信仰来判断人的好坏；就像他们在德拉姆容忍崇拜恶魔的牛头人一样，兹尼尔人可以与银色火焰的圣殿骑士或多尔-阿拉赫的战堡骑士一起工作。他们可能不喜欢和他们一起工作的人，他们可能认为他们的同伴的信仰是卑鄙或愚蠢的。但他们把责任放在这种个人关切之前，不会侮辱盟友或与他们争吵。",
	"The Gnoll language is unique, with a range of pitches that are difficult for humans to hear, let along duplicate. At first, it sounds much like the vocalizations of hyenas, with whining and chattering \"laughter.\" It's possible for non-gnolls to learn Gnoll, but it's a difficult feat. When stealth isn't necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it's common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond.": "地精的语言很独特，有一系列人类难以听到的音调，更不用说复制了。起初，它听起来很像鬣狗的发声，有呜咽和喋喋不休的 \"笑声\"。非格诺尔人有可能学会格诺尔语，但这是一项艰巨的任务。在不需要隐身的情况下，兹尼尔人在战斗中通常会很大声；他们通常用短促的格诺尔语来协调行动和确认位置。每个兹尼尔格诺尔人都有一个呼声，这是一种独特的呼声，它被用作一种口头签名；虽然这些呼声非常简短，但它们同时传达了个人身份和部族的忠诚。这些都是用来在战场上进行协调的，当一个地精进入一个友好的地方时，通常会发出呼声，作为一种简单的方式来识别自己，并给盟友一个回应的机会。",
	"Body language and posture—usually slumped—are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises up. The Znir dislike written communication, though they use it for contracts.": "肢体语言和姿势--通常是耷拉着的--是地精交流的一个重要部分；例如，当地精感到威胁或愤怒时，其脊柱下厚厚的毛峰会竖起来。Znir人不喜欢书面交流，尽管他们用它来签订合同。",
	"{@i Raat shi anaa:} the story continues. In the distant past, six mighty kings rose to power. Each sought to do their duty to their people: to bring them prosperity and security, to defeat all who would threaten them. Time and again, the six kings clashed on the field of battle, but the kings were matched in cunning and their warriors were equals in courage and skill. No victory could be won, and no compromise could be found. Jhazaal Dhakaan called the six kings together, and none could resist her summons. She brought them to a field soaked with blood and strewn with blunted blades.": "{@i Raat shi anaa:}故事继续。在遥远的过去，六位强大的国王崛起。每个人都试图为他们的人民履行职责：为他们带来繁荣和安全，击败所有威胁他们的人。一次又一次，六位国王在战场上发生冲突，但国王们的狡猾程度不相上下，他们的战士在勇气和技能方面也不相上下。没有胜利可言，也没有妥协可言。Jhazaal Dhakaan将六位国王召集在一起，没有人能够拒绝她的召唤。她把他们带到一个被鲜血浸透、散落着钝刀的场地。",
	"Jhazaal Dhakaan sang the song of the dar, reminding the kings that they were all one people. She sang the song of muut, of the duty all dar share. She sang the song of atcha, of the glory awaiting the people, of the heroes of the past and of those yet to come. With her words, she wove a dream, and she gave that dream to the six kings and to all who followed them. It was with this song that the Empire of Dhakaan was born, and it is this dream that guides us still.": "贾扎尔-达卡安唱起了达尔之歌，提醒国王们他们都是一个民族。她唱着muut的歌，唱着所有达尔人共同的责任。她唱的是Atcha之歌，唱的是等待人民的荣耀，唱的是过去和未来的英雄。她用她的话语编织了一个梦想，她把这个梦想给了六位国王和所有跟随他们的人。正是在这首歌的指引下，达卡安帝国诞生了，而且这个梦想至今仍在指导我们。",
	"Our empire was so grand that even the spirits grew jealous. The Lords of Madness crawled out of the shadows. They made monsters of our children and sought to break our people with terror. But no power could stand against the champions of Dhakaan. Our heroes blinded the Lord of Eyes and cut the roots of the Rotting Queen. They fought the great Corruptor and brought him down, but even as he fell, he whispered to the hero who defeated him. His foul words lingered, clinging to the champions, and they drowned out Jhazaal's song. As the whispers spread, those who heard them forgot the ways of muut and atcha. They forgot the glorious dream. They forgot what it meant to be dar. The duur'kala and the chot'uul came together, but there was no easy answer; only time would still the poisoned words. Our greatest leaders each took one of the treasures of our people and bore them down into the depths, into ancient fortresses that neither enemy nor poisoned word could penetrate. And there we remained, waiting for the echoes of that ancient curse to die, waiting to restore the dream of the people.": "我们的帝国是如此宏伟，甚至连神灵都嫉妒了。疯狂的领主从阴影中爬了出来。他们把我们的孩子变成了怪物，并试图用恐怖来摧毁我们的人民。但是，没有任何力量能够抵挡达卡安的冠军们。我们的英雄弄瞎了眼睛之王的眼睛，切断了腐烂女王的根基。他们与伟大的腐化者战斗，并将其击倒，但即使在他倒下时，他也对击败他的英雄低声说了话。他的污言秽语挥之不去，依附在冠军身上，它们淹没了贾扎勒的歌声。随着耳语的传播，那些听到耳语的人忘记了穆特和阿查的方式。他们忘记了光荣的梦想。他们忘记了成为达尔的意义。duur'kala和chot'uul走到了一起，但没有简单的答案；只有时间才能让这些有毒的话语停止。我们最伟大的领袖各自带着我们民族的一个宝藏，把它们带入深处，带入敌人和毒言都无法穿透的古老堡垒。我们留在那里，等待那古老诅咒的回声消失，等待恢复人民的梦想。",
	"Now that time is upon us. We have risen from our vaults and returned to a world that has been twisted by madness. Chaat'oor—defilers—have built foul cities on our foundations. The so-called \"goblins\" who remain have forgotten their glory and what it means to be dar. We must unite the Keepers of Dhakaan. We must reclaim our ancient treasures and crown the Emperor Yet to Come. And under their banner, we shall cleanse this land and restore our tarnished dream.": "现在，这个时代正在向我们走来。我们已经从地窖里站起来，回到了一个被疯狂扭曲的世界。Chaat'oor-诽谤者-在我们的地基上建造了肮脏的城市。留下来的所谓的 \"妖精 \"已经忘记了他们的荣耀和作为达尔的意义。我们必须团结达卡安的守护者。我们必须夺回我们古老的宝藏，为尚未到来的皇帝加冕。在他们的旗帜下，我们将净化这片土地，恢复我们被玷污的梦想。",

	"Little is known of the origins of the goblinoid species. Aereni records describe warring goblinoids on Khorvaire around forty thousand years ago, when the elves settled on Aerenal. But recent studies suggest that the goblinoids themselves appeared quite suddenly around this time. It's commonly believed that the goblinoids evolved in vast caverns below the surface, but some modern scholars hold competing theories. Kel Kador of the Library of Korranberg believes that the goblinoid subspecies were magebred from a common ancestor, and that this goblin progenitor might still be found underground. Hass Holan of Morgrave University has advanced a more exotic theory—that the goblinoids may have emerged from a demiplane within Khyber, from a warlike realm that has yet to be found. The goblins themselves have little interest in the origins of the {@i dar}—a Goblin word meaning \"the people.\" For them, the history of Dhakaan is the history of the dar. The two are considered synonymous, and regardless of their origins, the Dhakaani culture emerged approximately sixteen thousand years ago.": "对妖精物种的起源知之甚少。Aereni的记录描述了大约四万年前，当精灵们在Aerenal定居时，Khorvaire上的哥布林诺人发生了战争。但最近的研究表明，哥布林诺人本身就是在这个时候突然出现的。人们普遍认为，哥布林诺人是在地表下的巨大洞穴中进化而来的，但一些现代学者持有不同的理论。科兰伯格图书馆的凯尔-卡多认为，地精亚种是由一个共同的祖先磁力繁殖而来，而这个地精祖先可能仍然在地下被发现。莫格雷夫大学的哈斯-霍兰提出了一个更奇特的理论--地精可能是从开伯尔的一个半位面出现的，来自一个尚未被发现的好战领域。妖精们自己对{@i dar}的起源没有什么兴趣--妖精的意思是 \"人民\"。对他们来说，达卡安的历史就是达尔的历史。两者被认为是同义词，无论其起源如何，达卡尼文化出现在大约一万六千年前。",
	"The legend that opens this section deals with the roots of the Empire of Dhakaan, when six hobgoblin kings fought over ancient Khorvaire. Jhazaal Dhakaan was the greatest duur'kala bard of the age and the artifacts she crafted are testament to her remarkable power; the warhorn {@i Ghaal'duur} in chapter 7 is one of her creations. If the legend is to be believed, Jhazaal Dhakaan performed a feat of epic magic. She crafted the dream of an empire and bound the goblinoids of the time to this dream. This {@i Uul Dhakaan}—Dream of Dhakaan—gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first {@i marhu}—emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.": "本节开篇的传说涉及达卡安帝国的根源，当时六个妖精国王为古老的霍尔韦尔而战。Jhazaal Dhakaan是那个时代最伟大的duur'kala吟游诗人，她制作的神器证明了她的非凡能力；第七章中的战号（%0%）就是她的作品之一。如果传说是可信的，贾扎尔-达卡安完成了一项史诗般的魔法壮举。她精心打造了一个帝国的梦想，并将当时的妖精们捆绑在这个梦想上。这个{@i Uul Dhakaan}--达卡尼之梦--赋予了古老的妖精们统一的文化和目标，将他们团结在贾扎尔-达卡尼之下，成为达卡尼的第一位{@i marhu}--皇帝。达卡尼帝国遍布霍尔韦尔，将矮人推回开伯尔的深处，并将龙族赶到东部的丛林中。达卡尼人击退了泰尔纳达尔的殖民者，并将兽人、地精和其他次要文化人赶到了荒凉的边疆。",
	"The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the {@i duur'kala}—dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance—identified the threat but couldn't find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the {@i Kapaa'vola}—the Treacherous Whisper—had faded. These armies called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}, Keepers of the Empire—a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.": "达卡安的黄金时代持续了五千年之久，地精统治着后来被加利法尔要求的土地。正如传说中的那样，这个繁荣的时代随着Xoriat的入侵而结束，当时daelkyr带领反常者的军队进入Khorvaire。daelkyr摧毁了达卡尼的城市，并将哥布林诺人转化为畸形人，如dolgaunts和dolgrims。经过漫长而痛苦的斗争，达卡尼的冠军们扭转了局势。兽人守门人德鲁伊将达尔凯尔束缚在开伯尔，但正是达卡尼战士分散了他们的军队，猎杀了幸存的野兽。但正如传说中的那样，戴尔基尔即使在失败中也取得了胜利。腐蚀者Dyrrn创造了一种精神传染病，切断了地精与乌尔-达卡尼人的联系，并进一步鼓励了混乱的行为和非理性的信仰。{@i duur'kala}中的领导人--被视为智慧和指导的地精歌手--发现了这个威胁，但却找不到阻止它的方法；隔离是唯一的答案。达卡尼人决心保护自己的文化，他们把自己封闭在地下堡垒中，发誓只有在{@i Kapaa'vola}--诡谲的低语--消退后才会回来。这些军队称自己为{@i Kech Dhakaan}，帝国的守护者--这个词至今仍被用来涵盖所有达卡尼部族。",

As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor—artificers of Dhakaan—and the duur'kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth—that the foundations they'd built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel. It was in this time that the terms {@i goblin, bugbear,} and {@i hobgoblin} took root, even among the former dar themselves.": "从表面上看，帝国的残余部分四分五裂并崩溃了。就凯奇-达卡安人而言，达卡安帝国的历史在腐败者迪尔恩释放卡帕瓦人的那一刻就已经结束了。但事实上，在守护者们离开后，这个帝国还徘徊了几个世纪；更广泛的世界甚至不知道Kapaa'vola这个词，而历史书认为达卡安的衰落是一个漫长而丑陋的事件。迪尔恩的诅咒导致偏执狂和疯狂的信仰盛行，进一步使幸存者分裂。达卡安的纪律和知识消失了，达卡安的工匠--daashor和duur'kala的传统也被遗忘了。新的宗教和邪教出现了。一些部落拥护黑暗六神，而另一些部落则崇尚更广泛的万神殿。在达卡安的统治下，地精亚种被团结起来；在卡帕瓦人的统治下，强者统治弱者。一些部落发展了不寻常的复杂的传统，而另一些部落则是残酷和野蛮的。当人类探险家发现这些交战的部落生活在宏伟的城市废墟中时，许多人认为妖精族已经声称他们摧毁了人类文明的遗迹。这种错误的说法被用来为无数的暴行辩护。人类慢慢地取代了哥布林人，夺取了曾经属于达卡安的土地。妖精经常被征服，而虫族和霍布格林则被赶到荒野或开伯尔的上层。随着时间的推移，学者们了解了真相--他们所建立的基础是地精的城市，而不是人类的。但很少有人关心；在他们眼中，地精只是野蛮人，是黑暗六神的孩子，危险而残忍。正是在这个时候，{@i goblin, bugbear,}和{@i hobgoblin}这两个词开始扎根，甚至在以前的达尔人中也是如此。",
	"The oppression of goblins persisted for more than a thousand years, while bugbears and hobgoblins remained hostile forces in the fringes, dwelling in the wild lands ignored by humanity. When Galifar Wynarn began his conquest of the Five Nations, he promised freedom to any goblin who fought under his banner, Goblin soldiers played a vital role in the war that followed, and Galifar remained true to his word. Despite this freedom, goblins were still often treated with prejudice and suspicion, and denied education and other tools for success. Even today, goblins can be found in every major city of the Five Nations, but an overwhelming number live in poverty.": "对地精的压迫持续了一千多年，而虫族和霍布格林仍然是边缘的敌对势力，居住在被人类忽视的荒野之地。当加里法尔-维纳恩开始征服五国时，他承诺给任何在他旗帜下作战的地精以自由。地精士兵在随后的战争中发挥了至关重要的作用，而加里法尔仍然信守诺言。尽管有这样的自由，地精仍然经常受到偏见和怀疑的对待，并被剥夺了教育和其他成功的工具。即使在今天，在五国的每个主要城市都能找到地精，但绝大多数人都生活在贫困之中。",
	"In the shadow of Galifar, goblinoid cultures continued to develop and evolve. The most widespread were the Ghaal'dar tribes of the Seawall Mountains. While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal'dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued {@i muut} and {@i atcha}—their duty to their people and their personal honor—though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the {@i chaat'oor}–the non-native defilers—who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal'dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat'oor in the process.": "在加利法尔的阴影下，地精文化继续发展和进化。最广泛的是海堤山脉的Ghaal'dar部落。虽然他们仍然与乌尔-达卡安（Uul Dhakaan）断绝关系，对隐藏的守护者一无所知，但盖尔达尔人却恢复了他们古老历史的残片。妖精们追求{@i muut}和{@i atcha}--他们对人民的责任和个人的荣誉，尽管他们只知道这些是抽象的概念。他们对偷走他们古老土地的非本地破坏者（%2%）的愤怒得到了磨练。一些Ghaal'dar部落在最后一次战争中担任雇佣兵，在这个过程中对Chaat'oor有了更多了解。",
	"And then in 969 YK, chieftain Haruuc of the Rhukaan Taash led the uprising that claimed the lands of southern Cyre and founded the nation known as Darguun. Little did he know that other eyes were watching. Khesh'dar scouts and spies had been gathering information on the world above since the beginning of the Last War. The founding of Darguun made it even easier for the Silent Folk to move within the world. The duur'kala of the Kech Dhakaan concluded that the Kapaa'vola had faded; these Ghaal'dar might be victims of the daelkyr curse, but associating with them posed no threat to the Uul Dhakaan. And so, over the last two decades, the Keepers of Dhakaan have emerged from their vaults and returned to the world above.": "然后在公元969年，鲁卡安-塔什（Rhukaan Taash）的酋长哈鲁克（Haruuc）领导了起义，夺取了赛尔南部的土地，建立了被称为达尔古恩的国家。他不知道其他的眼睛在看着他。自最后一次战争开始以来，克什达尔的侦察兵和间谍一直在收集上面世界的信息。达尔古恩的建立使沉默民族在这个世界上的行动更加容易。Kech Dhakaan的duur'kala得出结论，Kapaa'vola已经消亡；这些Ghaal'dar可能是daelkyr诅咒的受害者，但与他们交往不会对Uul Dhakaan构成威胁。于是，在过去的20年里，达卡安的守护者们从他们的地窖里走出来，回到了上面的世界。",
	"{@i Ghaal'dar} is the Goblin word for \"mighty people.\" It has always been the Dhakaani term for the hobgoblins, just as the goblins are {@i golin'dar} (\"quick people\") and the bugbears are {@i guul'dar} (\"strong people\"). When used in lowercase—ghaal'dar—it refers to a hobgoblin of the Kech Dhakaan. However, when capitalized—Ghaal'dar—it's the name of the federation of hobgoblin-dominated tribes that dominate modern Darguun. The Ghaal'dar tribes are not Dhakaani; they mimic some of their customs and are proud of their imperial history, but they were twisted by the Kapaa'vola and differ from the dar in many important ways.": "{@i Ghaal'dar}是哥布林语的 \"强大的人\"。它一直是达卡尼人对妖精的称呼，就像妖精是{@i golin'dar}（\"敏捷的人\"），虫人是{@i guul'dar}（\"强壮的人\"）。当以小写字母ghaal'dar使用时，它指的是Kech Dhakaan的一个妖精。然而，当大写时--Ghaal'dar--它是主宰现代Darguun的、以妖精为主的部落联盟的名字。Ghaal'dar部落不是达卡尼人；他们模仿达卡尼人的一些习俗，并以他们的帝国历史为荣，但他们被卡帕瓦人扭曲了，在许多重要方面与达卡尼人不同。",
	"Likewise, {@i dar} means \"people.\" While common in the Goblin language, within this book, it's generally used to refer to the Dhakaani goblinoids who were unaffected by the Kapaa'vola. Today, the Ghaal'dar and other Darguuls have largely adopted the human words for their kind—goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear. Dar—the golin'dar, ghaal'dar, and guul'dar—are the original goblinoids who resisted daelkyr corruption.": "同样地，（%0%）的意思是 \"人\"。虽然在哥布林语言中很常见，但在本书中，它一般用来指未受卡帕瓦人影响的达卡尼哥布林人。如今，伽尔'达尔和其他达尔古尔人在很大程度上采用了人类对其种类的说法--哥布林、霍布林和虫人。达尔--戈林达尔、伽尔达尔和古尔达尔--是最初的妖精，他们抵制了达尔基尔的腐蚀。",
	"To unite the Six Kings, Jhazaal Dhakaan created a dream they could share—a vision that bound them all together. However, this isn't just a metaphor. When mortals sleep, their spirits touch Dal Quor and create temporary dreamscapes. Jhazaal Dhakaan bound the spirits of the dar together, creating a vast, permanent dreamscape within Dal Quor—a vision of the ideal empire. With the spirit of every dar tied to this place, when one of them sleeps, they dream of the empire and their place within it.": "为了团结六大国王，Jhazaal Dhakaan创造了一个他们可以共享的梦想--将他们所有人联系在一起的愿景。然而，这并不只是一个比喻。当凡人睡觉时，他们的精神会接触到Dal Quor并创造出暂时的梦境。Jhazaal Dhakaan将dar的精神捆绑在一起，在Dal Quor内创造了一个巨大的、永久的梦境--理想帝国的愿景。由于每个达尔的精神都与这个地方联系在一起，当他们中的一个人睡觉时，他们会梦到这个帝国和他们在其中的位置。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan isn't oppressive. Each dreaming dar has their own unique dreams within the Uul, and just like normal dreams, these are a place to process recent events and experiences. But the Uul Dhakaan provides a foundation that shapes and flavors those dreams, teaching and inspiring even while allowing the dar to process their own experiences. The Uul Dhakaan also retains the memories of all those who have gone before. While dreaming in the Uul Dhakaan, a warrior could experience a battle against the daelkyr that occurred thousands of years ago, fighting alongside one of the greatest heroes of that age. A smith could forge a blade alongside a legendary daashor. These things aren't real; both the hero and the smith are dreams, pieced together through memory. And as with any dream, the dreamer likely won't remember most of it after they wake up. But it remains in their subconscious as a source of inspiration and instinct. The dar {@i know} what the empire could and should be. They {@i know} the role they are supposed to play, the meaning of muut and atcha. And they {@i feel} the connection to the dar around them, understanding they all share that common vision. As discussed in the next section, this reinforces the other aspects of the Dhakaani psyche, strengthens their martial discipline, and underlies their adherence to caste roles.": "乌尔-达卡安并不压抑。每个做梦的达尔在乌尔有他们自己独特的梦，就像正常的梦一样，这些梦是处理最近事件和经验的地方。但是，Uul Dhakaan提供了一个塑造和调味这些梦想的基础，甚至在允许达尔处理他们自己的经验的同时，教导和启发。乌尔-达卡安还保留了所有前人的记忆。当在乌尔-达卡安做梦时，一个战士可以体验到几千年前发生的与达尔克尔的战斗，与那个时代最伟大的英雄之一并肩作战。一个铁匠可以和一个传奇的达索尔一起锻造一把刀。这些东西并不真实；英雄和铁匠都是梦，通过记忆拼凑起来的。就像任何梦一样，做梦的人在醒来后可能不会记得其中的大部分内容。但它仍然留在他们的潜意识中，成为灵感和本能的来源。达尔（%0%）帝国可以和应该是什么。他们（%1%）他们应该扮演的角色，muut和atcha的意义。而他们（%2%）与周围的达尔的联系，理解他们都有这个共同的愿景。正如下一节所讨论的，这加强了达卡尼人心理的其他方面，加强了他们的武术纪律，也是他们坚持种姓角色的基础。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan is a dream, and for most dar, it's nothing more than that. It's not something they discuss with outsiders, nor something they give much thought to from day to day; dreaming of the empire is just a part of life. But there are a few people within each kech who deal with the Uul Dhakaan in a more concrete fashion:": "乌尔-达卡安是一个梦想，对大多数达尔人来说，它不过如此。这不是他们与外人讨论的事情，也不是他们每天都会考虑的事情；对帝国的梦想只是生活的一部分。但在每个教会中，有几个人以更具体的方式处理Uul Dhakaan的问题。",
	"The \"dream watchers\" are an order of monks who monitor the Uul Dhakaan and protect it from corruption. In addition to specialized training and mental discipline, the chot'uul employ tools to retain their full consciousness and memories while dreaming, even allowing them to bring prized possessions into the dream. These {@i uul'kur} and {@i kra'uul} items are described in more detail in chapter 7. The chot'uul protect the Uul Dhakaan from quori manipulation, the corruption of the daelkyr, and other spiritual threats.": "看梦人 \"是一个僧侣组织，他们监督Uul Dhakaan并保护它不被腐蚀。除了专门的训练和精神纪律外，chot'uul还使用工具在做梦时保留他们的全部意识和记忆，甚至允许他们把珍贵的财产带入梦中。这些{@i uul'kur}和{@i kra'uul}的物品在第七章有更详细的描述。Chot'uul保护Uul Dhakaan免受Quori的操纵、daelkyr的腐蚀和其他精神威胁。",
	"A dirge singer's training often includes time within the Uul Dhakaan. An {@i uul'kur} allows the novice duur'kala to experience historical events within the dream or to study with the memory-shades of duur'kala masters.": "哀歌者的训练往往包括在乌尔-达卡安的时间。一个{@i uul'kur}允许新手duur'kala在梦中体验历史事件或与duur'kala大师的记忆阴影一起学习。",
	"The \"dream singers\" are dirge singers who specialize in walking in dreams. The deep vaults of the Kech Dhakaan are spread across Khorvaire, and the uul'kala act as their ambassadors and emissaries, maintaining communication between each kech and planning strategies. This serves a similar role to the {@item speaking stone|ERLW|speaking stones} of House Sivis, for a duur'kala equipped with an {@i uul'kur} can report back to superiors in their dreams. While useful, this practice isn't as widespread as the speaking stones of the Five Nations. {@i Uul'kur} are a limited resource, and even with one, it takes skill to navigate within the dream. There are kech vaults that lost their last uul'kala over the centuries in isolation, and as a result, that clan's fate remains unknown to the present day.": "梦想歌手 \"是专门在梦中行走的哀歌歌手。Kech Dhakaan的深库分布在Khorvaire，而uul'kala作为他们的大使和使者，在每个Kech之间保持沟通并计划战略。这与西维斯家族的{@item speaking stone|ERLW|speaking stones}有类似的作用，因为配备了{@i uul'kur}的杜尔卡拉可以在梦中向上级汇报。虽然很有用，但这种做法并不像五国的说话石那样普遍。{@i Uul'kur}是一种有限的资源，即使有一个，也需要技巧才能在梦中导航。有一些凯奇金库在几个世纪的隔离中失去了最后的uul'kala，因此，该部族的命运至今仍是未知数。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan serves as a foundation for the Dhakaani psyche, reinforcing their beliefs and traditions. But it's not an oppressive force, and for most Dhakaani, it's simply a source of instinct and inspiration. In creating a Dhakaani character, consider whether the Uul Dhakaan holds any special importance for you.": "乌尔-达卡安是达卡尼人心理的基础，强化了他们的信仰和传统。但它并不是一种压迫性的力量，对大多数达卡尼人来说，它只是一种本能和灵感的来源。在创造达卡尼人的角色时，要考虑乌尔-达卡安对你是否有特殊的重要性。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan is a stable region within Dal Quor. Dar are naturally drawn to it when they sleep, but it's possible for other creatures to stumble on it by accident, or even to seek it out. Chot'uul monks guard the dream, along with guardians formed by the dream itself, but this security isn't absolute.": "乌尔-达卡安是达尔-库尔的一个稳定区域。达尔人在睡觉时自然会被吸引到这里，但其他生物也有可能无意中发现它，甚至是寻找它。Chot'uul僧侣守护着这个梦境，还有由梦境本身形成的守护者，但这种安全并不是绝对的。",
	"There are many reasons adventurers might seek out the Uul Dhakaan. It holds the memories of the Dhakaani Empire, and could contain secrets about a weakness of daelkyr or locations of ancient relics. The King's Citadel might try to infiltrate the dream to learn more about the plans of the Kech Dhakaan. A Dhakaani character might need the help of other adventurers to repair some sort of disruption or corruption within the dream; are the chot'uul unable to see it, or have they themselves been corrupted? Again, while it is a repository of knowledge, the Uul Dhakaan is a dream, not designed for maximum efficiency or ease of use. Elements shift and change. You can revisit an ancient battlefield, but you'll have to find that battlefield, or find a way to call it up from the collective well of memories. The uul'kala and chot'uul are trained to find their way around the dreamempire, but such travel isn't always quick or easy.": "冒险家们有很多理由去寻找乌尔-达卡尼。它保存着达卡尼帝国的记忆，并可能包含关于达克尔的弱点或古代遗物位置的秘密。国王城堡可能会试图渗透到梦境中去，以了解更多关于凯奇-达卡尼的计划。达卡尼的角色可能需要其他冒险者的帮助来修复梦境中的某种破坏或腐败；是chot'uul无法看到，还是他们自己被腐蚀了？同样，虽然它是一个知识库，但Uul Dhakaan是一个梦，并不是为了最大限度地提高效率或方便使用而设计的。元素转移和变化。你可以重访一个古老的战场，但你必须找到那个战场，或者找到一种方法从集体记忆的井中调用它。uul'kala和chot'uul被训练成能在梦境中找到自己的路，但这种旅行并不总是快速或容易的。",
	"At the DM's discretion, a character that serves as an uul'kala or a chot'uul might possess rituals that allow them to draw allies into a dream, each maintaining full consciousness within the Uul. Otherwise, dream adventures will require tools like the {@i uul'kur} presented in chapter 6.": "根据DM的判断，作为uul'kala或chot'uul的角色可能拥有一些仪式，允许他们把盟友吸引到梦中，每个人都在Uul中保持完全的意识。否则，梦境冒险将需要像第六章中介绍的（%0%）那样的工具。",
	"So far, the quori have largely ignored the Uul Dhakaan. If anything, the stability of the dream-empire supports the overall goals of the Dreaming Dark, and the chot'uul are always watching for outside forces manipulating the dream. However, a campaign could explore a quori attempt to subvert the Uul, or consider the consequences of an alliance between the uul'kala and the Dreaming Dark. The Uul Dhakaan was formed in the current age of the Dreaming Dark; the Dhakaani know nothing of the quori belief in the Turning of the Age, and no one knows what will happen to the Uul Dhakaan when this occurs.": "到目前为止，曲里人在很大程度上忽略了乌尔-达卡安。如果有的话，梦想帝国的稳定支持了梦想黑暗的整体目标，而chot'uul一直在关注操纵梦想的外部力量。然而，一场战役可以探讨夸瑞试图颠覆乌尔，或者考虑乌尔卡拉和梦幻黑暗之间结盟的后果。Uul Dhakaan是在当前的梦幻黑暗时代形成的；Dhakaani对quori关于时代之交的信仰一无所知，也没有人知道当这一情况发生时，Uul Dhakaan会发生什么。",
	"When humans first came to Khorvaire, they knew nothing of the fallen goblin empire. What does the typical citizen of the Five Nations know today? Can a Brelish soldier tell the difference between a Ghaal'dar mercenary and a Dhakaani duur'kala? For that matter, what do the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins know about the Heirs of Dhakaan?": "当人类第一次来到Khorvaire时，他们对堕落的哥布林帝国一无所知。今天，五国的典型公民知道什么？布雷利什的士兵能分辨出Ghaal'dar雇佣兵和Dhakaani duur'kala之间的区别吗？就这一点而言，Ghaal'dar的妖精们对达卡尼的继承人了解多少？",
	"Anyone who has received the common education of the Five Nations knows that there was a goblin empire that fell before humans arrived on Khorvaire. Recalling the name \"Dhakaan\" requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. With a DC 15 check, a character also knows broad details—the territory controlled by the empire, the timeline of its rise and fall, the role of the subspecies, and its clashes with other cultures. A DC 20 check provides very detailed information: the importance of muut and atcha, the names of specific rulers, perhaps even the knowledge of the Kapaa'vola and the belief that some clans fled from this threat. Goblinoids of Darguun are more broadly familiar with their history, and would certainly know the name of the Empire of Dhakaan, know about the duur'kala and the Silent Clans, and understand the idea of muut and atcha, even if they don't experience these concepts in the same way as the dar. Darguuls must still make a history check to recall the names of specific heroes or events tied to the empire, but generally receive advantage on such checks.": "任何接受过五国共同教育的人都知道，在人类到达Khorvaire之前，有一个地精帝国已经灭亡。回顾 \"达卡安 \"这个名字需要成功进行DC10智力（历史）检查。通过DC15检查，一个角色也知道大致的细节--帝国控制的领土，它的兴衰时间表，亚种的作用，以及它与其他文化的冲突。DC20检定可以提供非常详细的信息：muut和atcha的重要性，特定统治者的名字，甚至可能知道Kapaa'vola以及一些部族逃离这一威胁的信念。达尔古尔的哥布林人更广泛地熟悉他们的历史，肯定会知道达卡安帝国的名字，知道duur'kala和沉默氏族，并理解muut和atcha的概念，即使他们没有像达尔人那样体验这些概念。达斡尔人仍然必须进行历史检查，以回忆起与帝国有关的特定英雄或事件的名字，但通常在这种检查中获得优势。",
	"So this is what people know about the fallen empire—but what about the Kech Dhakaan and its many clans? Do people know the origin and goals of the Keepers? This is more complicated, as the Kech Dhakaan have chosen to hide in plain sight. Before Darguun, goblinoid tribes and clans were scattered across the wilds of Khorvaire. When Haruuc established his nation, many unknown tribes stepped out of the shadows to take a place in his court. This was a perfect opportunity for the Kech Dhakaan and its Silent Clans. Two of these clans, the Kech Volaar and the Kech Shaarat have both revealed themselves to the Darguuls; but they have concealed their age, their power, and their resources. The Ghaal'dar know the Kech Volaar as an isolated clan of scholars with talented duur'kala. They know the Kech Shaarat as proud and deadly warriors. But the Ghaal'dar don't know that these clans have a direct tie to the ancient empire, that they possess powerful Dhakaani relics and daashor artificers, or that these clans are preparing to choose a new emperor of their own. Likewise, the Ghaal'dar don't know anything about the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand the fundamental differences between the modern goblins and the ancient dar. And because the Kech Dhakaan hide their true numbers and capabilities, the Ghaal'dar don't realize just how powerful these clans are; most of the Ghaal'dar tribes believe that the kech are small and somewhat backward, out of touch with modern life.": "因此，这就是人们所知道的关于堕落帝国的情况--但是凯奇-达卡安和它的许多部族呢？人们知道守护者的起源和目标吗？这就更复杂了，因为Kech Dhakaan人选择了隐藏在众目睽睽之下。在达尔古恩之前，地精部落和部族散布在霍尔韦尔的荒野中。当哈鲁克建立他的国家时，许多不知名的部落走出阴影，在他的宫廷中占据一席之地。这对凯奇-达卡安及其沉默的部族来说是一个完美的机会。这些部族中的两个，凯奇-沃拉尔和凯奇-沙拉特都向达尔古尔人透露了自己的身份；但他们隐瞒了自己的年龄、权力和资源。Ghaal'dar知道Kech Volaar是一个与世隔绝的学者部族，拥有天才的duur'kala。他们知道凯奇-沙拉特人是骄傲而致命的战士。但Ghaal'dar不知道这些部族与古代帝国有直接联系，不知道他们拥有强大的达卡尼遗物和达索尔工匠，也不知道这些部族正准备选择一个属于他们的新皇帝。同样，盖尔达尔人对乌尔-达卡尼人一无所知，他们也不了解现代地精和古代达尔人之间的根本区别。而且由于Kech Dhakaan隐藏了他们的真实数量和能力，Ghaal'dar并没有意识到这些部族有多强大；大多数Ghaal'dar部落认为Kech是小规模的，有些落后的，与现代生活脱节。",
	"If the Darguuls know little about the Kech Dhakaan, the people of the Five Nations know even less. When traveling abroad, the Heirs of Dhakaan generally take advantage of the broad ignorance of goblin culture, allowing people to assume that they're Darguul mercenaries. They won't hide their names or distinctive equipment, but it's a rare human who recognizes Dhakaani designs. Generally, the only way someone knows details about the Kech Dhakaan is if they've had personal experience with them.": "如果说达尔古尔人对凯奇-达卡安知之甚少，那么五国的人就更不了解了。在国外旅行时，达卡尼的继承人通常利用人们对地精文化的广泛无知，让人们以为他们是达古尔人的雇佣兵。他们不会隐藏自己的名字或独特的装备，但很少有人类能认出达卡尼的设计。一般来说，有人知道关于凯奇-达卡尼的细节的唯一途径是他们与他们有个人经历。",
	"To understand the Dhakaani, one must know the factors that shape them—biological, cultural, and supernatural. Some of these factors apply to all goblinoids, while others were weakened or destroyed by the Kapaa'vola, and apply solely to the Kech Dhakaan. As with any race or culture, these are generalized traits, and any individual dar could stray radically from this foundation. But it's a place to begin when creating a Dhakaani player character or NPC.": "要了解达卡尼人，就必须知道塑造他们的因素--生物的、文化的和超自然的。其中一些因素适用于所有的地精，而另一些则被卡帕瓦人削弱或摧毁，只适用于凯奇-达卡尼族。与任何种族或文化一样，这些都是概括性的特征，任何个别的达尔都可能完全偏离这一基础。但是，在创建达卡尼的玩家角色或NPC时，这是一个可以开始的地方。",
	"At a glance, the goblinoid subspecies are as different from one another as humans and halflings. The subspecies can't interbreed and have different lifespans. But a primal connection binds the dar together, with scent, body language, and other subtle factors uniting them; at an instinctual level, they feel more comfortable around goblinoids than they do with other humanoids.": "一眼望去，地精亚种之间的差异就像人类和半身人一样。这些亚种不能杂交，而且有不同的寿命。但一种原始的联系将达尔人联系在一起，气味、肢体语言和其他微妙的因素将他们联系在一起；在本能的层面上，他们觉得在地精族身边比在其他人形生物身边更舒服。",
	"Goblinoid civilization began in the caverns of Khyber, and the Kech Dhakaan have lived in subterranean vaults for countless generations. They are comfortable in close and barren environments, and may find vast open spaces to be disorienting.": "妖精文明起源于开伯尔的洞穴，凯奇-达卡安人在地下拱顶生活了无数个世代。他们在近距离和贫瘠的环境中很舒服，可能会发现广阔的开放空间让人迷失方向。",
	"Tied to their subterranean origins, the dar are used to living by the dim light of luminescent fungi or with no light at all. While absolute darkness impairs their darkvision, it's still possible to see and operate under those conditions, and many goblin tunnels have no light whatsoever. As a result, the dar have no inherent fear of darkness. They generally prefer to be active in times of dim light when their night-blind enemies are disadvantaged but the goblins can see freely, and Dhakaani communities come alive as night falls.": "与他们的地下出身有关，达尔人习惯于靠发光真菌的微弱光线或根本没有光线来生活。虽然绝对的黑暗损害了他们的黑暗视觉，但在这种条件下仍有可能看到和操作，而且许多地精隧道没有任何光线。因此，达尔人对黑暗没有固有的恐惧。他们一般喜欢在光线昏暗的时候活动，这时他们的夜盲症敌人处于劣势，但地精却可以自由地看东西，当夜幕降临时，达卡尼社区就会活跃起来。",
	"At a primal level, the dar seek structure and hierarchy. They prefer to work in groups and to have a clear plan of action, and tend toward lawful alignments. This doesn't mean that they feel any compulsion to follow the laws humans impose; rather, they are more inclined to work with others and to respect authority within their own communities. This basic instinct strengthens both the cultural drive of muut and the impact of the Uul Dhakaan.": "在原始的层面上，达尔人寻求结构和等级制度。他们喜欢在群体中工作，有一个明确的行动计划，并倾向于合法的结盟。这并不意味着他们感到有任何强迫性要遵守人类强加的法律；相反，他们更倾向于与他人合作，尊重自己社区内的权威。这种基本本能既加强了muut的文化动力，也加强了Uul Dhakaan的影响。",
	"The minds of dar are inherently pragmatic and rational. They have trouble engaging with entirely abstract concepts or things that cannot be proven. They prefer history to fiction; while the duur'kala inspire troops with stories, these are tales of things that actually happened. As a result, divine spellcasters are rare among the dar, as they struggle with the transcendental faith required to channel divine magic. While this could be considered a cultural trait, it's tied to the underlying psyche of the dar; they take well to structure and discipline, but struggle with pure faith. The Kapaa'vola weakened this trait within the wider goblinoid population, and there are priests of the Sovereigns and Six among the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins, but even there, priests, paladins, and divine magic are less common than among humans and their kin.": "达尔的思想本质上是务实的和理性的。他们很难接触到完全抽象的概念或无法证明的事物。他们更喜欢历史而不是小说；虽然杜尔卡拉用故事来激励军队，但这些故事都是实际发生的事情的故事。因此，神圣的施法者在达尔人中很少见，因为他们对引导神圣的魔法所需的超凡的信仰感到挣扎。虽然这可以被认为是一种文化特征，但它与达尔人的基本心理相联系；他们对结构和纪律很适应，但对纯粹的信仰却很挣扎。卡帕沃拉人在更广泛的地精人口中削弱了这一特征，在加尔达尔的地精中也有君主和六人组的祭司，但即使在那里，祭司、圣骑士和神圣魔法也不如在人类和他们的亲属中常见。",
	"The pointed ears of the dar are more flexible than human ears, and are an important part of the body language of the dar. Hobgoblins have especially expressive ears, and it's common for hobgoblin soldiers to use their ears to signal allies when silence is required, the same way a human soldier would use hand gestures. Two quick flicks of the ear is a common signal to allies to {@i be on guard}. Consider the ears of a dar in describing its mood.": "达尔人的尖耳朵比人类的耳朵更灵活，是达尔人身体语言的重要组成部分。霍布林的耳朵特别有表现力，霍布林士兵在需要安静的时候用耳朵向盟友发出信号是很常见的，就像人类士兵用手势一样。快速地扇动两下耳朵是向盟友发出的常见信号（%0%）。在描述达尔的情绪时，考虑到它的耳朵。",
	"Dhakaani society revolves around the concepts of {@i muut} and {@i atcha}. Muut is typically translated as \"duty,\" though it can also be seen as \"the honor of the empire\"—something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don't expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to \"thank you\" is {@i ta muut,} which simply means, \"You do your duty.\"": "达卡尼社会围绕着（%0%）和（%1%）的概念展开。Muut通常被翻译为 \"责任\"，尽管它也可以被看作是 \"帝国的荣誉\"--每个人都必须努力维护的东西。穆特是对你的期望，是你对你的战友们的回报。达卡尼人不会因为做了必须要做的事情而期望得到感谢；相反，他们对那些推卸责任的人感到厌恶。与 \"感谢 \"最接近的达卡尼语是{@i ta muut,}，意思很简单：\"你做你的职责\"。",
	"By contrast, atcha refers to \"personal honor\" or \"glory,\" an opportunity to exceed what is required of you. No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation {@i paatcha} means, \"This is a chance to gain honor!\"": "相比之下，atcha指的是 \"个人荣誉 \"或 \"荣耀\"，是一个超越对你的要求的机会。没有一个人满足于简单地做所期望的事情；对阿查的追求是一种强大的驱动力，它督促着飞镖去追逐他们的全部潜力。在战斗中，劝告（%0%）的意思是，\"这是一个获得荣誉的机会！\"",
	"The Ghaal'dar have adopted the concepts of muut and atcha, but merely as abstract concepts. For the dar, muut and atcha are the driving poles of daily life. Every dar {@i knows} muut; they know what is expected and what they owe to the empire. They feel a deep bond to their fellow dar, and know that in pursuing muut, they serve the common good. At the same time, they yearn to attain atcha—to exceed expectations, to do deeds that will be remembered by those who follow you. The deep role of muut and atcha is shaped both by childhood training, by daily life, and further by the Uul Dhakaan. So while Dhakaani have personal desires and ambitions, muut should always come first.": "Ghaal'dar采用了muut和atcha的概念，但只是作为抽象的概念。对于dar来说，muut和atcha是日常生活的驱动极。每个达尔（%0%）都是muut；他们知道什么是预期的，以及他们对帝国的亏欠。他们对自己的同伴感到深深的联系，并知道在追求muut的过程中，他们为共同利益服务。同时，他们渴望达到atcha--超越期望，做一些会被追随者记住的事。muut和atcha的深层作用是由童年训练和日常生活塑造的，并进一步由Uul Dhakaan塑造。因此，虽然达卡尼有个人的欲望和野心，但muut应该永远是第一位的。",
	"The Dhakaani idea of \"honor in victory\" is quite different from that of Dol Arrah and the people of the Five Nations. The Dhakaani prize victory and efficiency, both on and off the battlefield. Atcha comes from standing your ground against seemingly impossible odds and from displaying skill and discipline. There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire—but when possible, it's always better to kill for the empire. Muut demands that dar honor their debts and keep their promises; but ultimately, muut only binds dar to dar, and some feel no shame in lying to the chaat'oor who have stolen their lands and pillaged their tombs.": "达卡尼人对 \"胜利的荣誉 \"的想法与多尔-阿拉赫和五国人民的想法完全不同。达卡尼人重视胜利和效率，无论是在战场上还是在战场外。胜利来自于在看似不可能的情况下坚守阵地，来自于显示出的技巧和纪律。使用狡猾的手段来击败优势敌人是一种荣誉，因此，如果这是穆特的要求，游击战、伏击敌人，甚至暗杀都是可以接受的战术。达尔必须准备好为帝国而死，但在可能的情况下，为帝国而杀总是更好的。穆特要求达尔履行他们的债务，遵守他们的承诺；但最终，穆特只把达尔和达尔联系在一起，有些人觉得对偷走他们的土地和掠夺他们的坟墓的Chaat'oor撒谎并不羞耻。",
	"The culture of the Kech Dhakaan is relentlessly martial. The Keepers are armies who have been keeping the dream of the empire alive for thousands of years. There is no place for indolence or waste among the Dhakaani; surviving countless generations in the deep vaults required strict discipline. The young are assigned roles based on their subspecies and their aptitudes, and progress is based on performance. Now that the Dhakaani have returned to the surface, resources are more plentiful and life is less austere. However, thousands of years of strict tradition remain in place.": "Kech Dhakaan的文化是无情的武术。守护者是几千年来一直保持帝国梦想的军队。达卡尼人中没有懒惰或浪费的地方；在深藏的地窖中生存了无数代，需要严格的纪律。年轻人根据他们的亚种和他们的能力被分配角色，而进步则基于表现。现在，达卡尼人已经回到了地面，资源更加丰富，生活也不那么艰苦了。然而，数千年来的严格传统仍然存在。",
	"Within the Kech Dhakaan, all of the dar subspecies are celebrated for their strengths and what they have to offer the empire. This is reinforced both by the principle of muut and by the Uul Dhakaan. While different subspecies fill different roles in their community, it's important to note that among the Dhakaani, {@i all} roles are respected. Among the surface-dwelling Darguuls, goblins are often oppressed and dismissed, forced into menial tasks—by contrast, the Dhakaani are grateful for the service of the golin'dar, whether they are skilled crafters or menial workers. The goblin who cleans the latrines is serving the demands of muut as fully as a formidable hobgoblin warlord. The ghaal'dar lead because they are natural leaders. The guul'dar use their strength for the greater good. These things are simply {@i understood}, and the ghaal'dar don't have to use force to enforce their rule.": "在凯奇-达卡安（Kech Dhakaan）内部，所有的达尔亚种都因其优势和他们对帝国的贡献而受到赞誉。这一点在穆特原则和乌尔-达卡安中得到了加强。虽然不同的亚种在他们的社区中担任不同的角色，但重要的是要注意，在达卡尼人中，（%0%）角色受到尊重。在居住在地表的达尔古尔人中，妖精经常被压迫和解雇，被迫从事琐碎的工作--相比之下，达卡尼人对戈林达尔人的服务心存感激，无论他们是熟练的工匠还是琐碎的工人。打扫厕所的妖精是在为穆特的要求服务，就像一个强大的妖精军阀一样充分。ghaal'dar领导，因为他们是天生的领导者。guul'dar为了更大的利益而使用他们的力量。这些事情很简单（%1%），Ghaal'dar不需要使用武力来实施他们的统治。",
	"Stemming from this sense of unity, dar avoid killing other dar whenever they can. The Kech Dhakaan have different views on the future course of the empire, and each kech hopes to fill the throne. But they recognize that they are few against a world, and can't afford to carelessly spill the blood of other dar. This principle doesn't apply to the modern goblinoids of Darguun, the \"bugbears\" and \"hobgoblins.\" Physically, these creatures are dar, but they don't know the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand muut as the dar do. The leaders of the Kech Shaarat believe that while it may be possible to use the Darguuls, ultimately, they are not dar and must be treated as enemies. Some of the Kech Volaar are searching for a way to reconcile to these lost kin, expanding the Uul Dhakaan, undoing the damage of the Kapaa'vola and restoring its victims to the fold. Others among the Volaar argue that coexistence should be considered, that the isolationism of the empire must be reconsidered in the face of the widespread, powerful nations of the modern age. But compromise has never been a virtue of the Dhakaani, and what happens next will depend on the Emperor Yet to Come.": "源于这种团结的意识，只要有可能，达尔就会避免杀害其他达尔。Kech Dhakaan对帝国的未来发展方向有不同的看法，每个Kech都希望能坐上王位。但他们认识到，他们是少数人对一个世界，不能不小心地洒下其他达尔的血。这一原则并不适用于达尔古恩的现代妖精，即 \"虫族 \"和 \"霍布林\"。从身体上看，这些生物是达尔人，但他们不知道乌尔-达卡安，他们也不像达尔人那样理解穆特。Kech Shaarat的领导人认为，虽然有可能利用达尔古尔人，但最终，他们不是达尔人，必须作为敌人对待。一些凯奇-沃拉尔人正在寻找一种与这些失去的亲属和解的方法，扩大乌尔-达卡安，消除卡帕阿-沃拉的损害，并将其受害者恢复到该阵营。沃拉尔人中的其他人认为，应该考虑共存，面对现代广泛的强大国家，必须重新考虑帝国的孤立主义。但妥协从来都不是达卡尼人的美德，接下来会发生什么将取决于尚未到来的皇帝。",
	"While the principle of muut calls for individual sacrifice for the good of the empire, the dar generally have no great empathy for other species, and they are willing to take harsh action to secure the prosperity of their people. The Dhakaani don't subjugate other species—but not because of compassion. Rather, they consider it inefficient to try to force their values and traditions on creatures who have no concept of muut and who don't share the Uul Dhakaan. Thus, Dhakaani tradition has always been to drive enemies out of their territories, or if such exile is impossible, to kill them. They are fine with coexistence—as long as the enemy exists over there, and as long as the dar don't need more land.": "虽然Muut原则要求个人为帝国的利益做出牺牲，但达尔人通常对其他物种没有很大的同情心，他们愿意采取严厉的行动来确保他们的人民的繁荣。达卡尼人不征服其他物种--但不是因为同情心。相反，他们认为把自己的价值观和传统强加给那些没有Muut概念和不分享Uul Dhakaan的生物是没有效率的。因此，达卡尼人的传统一直是把敌人赶出他们的领土，如果这种放逐是不可能的，就把他们杀死。他们对共存没有意见--只要敌人在那边存在，只要达人不需要更多的土地。",
	"Family lines are of minimal importance among the Keepers. Rank must be earned, not inherited from a parent, and family names are only used within a clan. In a formal situation, the full clan name is used with no article (\"Dhaaka of Kech Volaar\"). Leaders often use the surname Dhakaan as a way of indicating that the empire itself is their family; thus, Tuura Dhakaan of Kech Volaar and Ruus Dhakaan of Kech Shaarat aren't actually related, it's a formal affectation.": "家系在守护者中的重要性微乎其微。等级必须靠自己争取，而不是从父母那里继承，而且姓氏只在一个部族内使用。在正式场合下，使用全宗族的名字，没有冠词（\"Kech Volaar的Dhaaka\"）。领导人经常使用Dhakaan这个姓氏，以表明帝国本身就是他们的家族；因此，Kech Volaar的Tuura Dhakaan和Kech Shaarat的Ruus Dhakaan实际上并没有关系，这是一种正式的影响。",
	"Depending on their purpose in the wider world, it's common for dar to use a \"traveling name\" among {@i gath'dar}—a general term for non-Dhakaani, without the pejorative tone of chaat'oor. The Kech Volaar and Kech Shaarat have both revealed their presence (though while posing as Darguul clans) and their names are used freely; other clans may or may not choose to operate openly.": "根据他们在更广泛的世界中的目的，达尔在{@i gath'dar}中使用 \"旅行的名字 \"是很常见的--对非达卡尼人的一般称呼，没有Chaat'oor的贬义语气。Kech Volaar和Kech Shaarat都透露了他们的存在（虽然是在冒充达尔古尔部族的时候），他们的名字被自由使用；其他部族可能选择公开活动，也可能不选择。",
	"The dar are soldiers. Most wear common uniforms, which have diverged slightly across clans, but the core designs are similar. Dhakaani uniforms and armor are durable and functional, designed to be worn comfortably for extended periods. Officers often sport hornlike protrusions on their helmets or shoulder plates that indicate rank. Many dar also wear an armored mask that covers the lower face; for lower-ranking soldiers, the design of the mask is usually tied to the clan, while for officers, it may evoke an honored ancestor or an imposing beast.": "达尔人是士兵。大多数人穿着普通的制服，这些制服在不同的部族中略有不同，但核心设计是相似的。达卡尼人的制服和盔甲经久耐用，功能齐全，可以长时间舒适地穿着。军官们的头盔或肩板上常常有角状突起，以显示军衔。许多达卡尼人还戴着覆盖下脸的装甲面具；对于低级别的士兵来说，面具的设计通常与部族有关，而对于军官来说，它可能会让人联想到一位尊贵的祖先或一只威武的野兽。",
	"Many dar make use of tattoos or scarification. Kech symbols are a common marking, but some—notably the Kech Volaar—take this further, with an ongoing series of tattoos that reflect the bearer's life and accomplishments.": "许多达尔人利用纹身或伤疤。凯奇符号是一种常见的标记，但有些人--特别是凯奇-沃拉尔人--更进一步，用一系列持续的纹身来反映持有者的生活和成就。",
	"Dhakaani art, like the rest of their culture, is practical and functional. Dar aren't fond of abstraction, and their art is primarily instructional (depicting an ideal to strive toward) or commemorative (preserving the deeds of heroes). Dar art can be realistic—faithfully representing historical figures—or symbolic—depicting Dhaakani ideals in simple and iconic ways.": "达卡尼人的艺术，就像他们文化的其他部分一样，是实用和功能性的。达卡尼人不喜欢抽象的东西，他们的艺术主要是指导性的（描绘了一个需要努力实现的理想）或纪念性的（保存了英雄的事迹）。达尔人的艺术可以是现实的--忠实地表现历史人物，也可以是象征性的--以简单和标志性的方式描述达卡尼的理想。",
	"Dar clothing and art is generally designed to be viewed in dark subterranean tunnels, where darkvision conveys color in shades of gray. As a result, color combinations can seem quite odd to human eyes, but this is because they aren't chosen for their color, but for how they appear in the dark.": "达尔人的服装和艺术一般都是为了在黑暗的地下隧道中观看，在那里，黑暗视觉以灰色的深浅来传达颜色。因此，在人类眼中，颜色组合可能看起来很奇怪，但这是因为它们不是因为颜色而被选择，而是因为它们在黑暗中的表现。",
	"The Kech Dhakaan began as armies, and further had limited resources in the deep vaults; as a result, their food focuses on practical nutrition, and waste is unacceptable. Dhakaani cuisine is simple, hearty, and very portable once prepared. Food tends to be thick and chewy, with sour and bitter flavors central to the dar palate, and strong spices sometimes used to mask undesirable tastes. On the surface, a grain known as {@i noon} is a primary source of sustenance. In the subterranean vaults, a fungus called {@i suur} fills this role. Surface-dwelling dar enjoy lizards and snakes—sources of both eggs and meat—while in the depths, blind cave fish and insects are common sources of protein.": "凯奇-达卡尼人开始时是军队，进一步在深宫中拥有有限的资源；因此，他们的食物注重实用营养，浪费是不可接受的。达卡尼人的菜肴简单、丰盛，而且一旦准备好就非常容易携带。食物往往是厚实耐嚼的，酸味和苦味是达卡尼人口味的核心，强烈的香料有时被用来掩盖不受欢迎的味道。在地表，一种被称为（%0%）的谷物是主要的养料来源。在地下拱顶，一种被称为{@i suur}的真菌充当了这个角色。地表居住的达尔喜欢蜥蜴和蛇--蛋和肉的来源，而在深处，盲洞鱼和昆虫是常见的蛋白质来源。",
	"Suur and noon are usually eaten in the form of starchy balls. Other Dhakaani meals are typically boiled or steamed in flavored liquids, such as eggs boiled in broth. In addition to being used for seasoning, pickling is a crucial form of preservation. Dehydrated meats, especially chewy lizard and fish jerky, are also common staples.": "苏尔和午时通常以淀粉球的形式食用。其他达卡尼餐通常是在调味液体中煮或蒸，如用肉汤煮鸡蛋。除了用于调味外，腌制也是一种重要的保存方式。脱水肉，特别是有嚼劲的蜥蜴和鱼干，也是常见的主食。",
	"While sweet foods are rare within the kech, the golin'dar have a noted sweet tooth. Traveling goblins often indulge in sweets and desserts while traveling with gath'dar. However, dar are often lactose intolerant, and as a result, might avoid many gath'dar foods.": "虽然甜食在凯奇内部很少见，但戈林达尔人却很喜欢甜食。旅行中的地精经常在与gath'dar一起旅行时沉溺于甜食和甜点中。然而，达尔通常对乳糖不耐受，因此，可能会避免许多加斯达尔的食物。",
	"Dhakaani daashor are the finest weaponsmiths on Khorvaire, their skill at metallurgy outstripping even House Cannith. Their traditions blend mundane skill and transmutation to create and manipulate remarkable alloys, including adamantine, mithral, and byeshk, and Dhakaani champions often wield weapons forged from such material. Dhakaani equipment is designed for durability and efficiency, rarely gaudy or bejeweled. Likewise, armor is tough and flexible—often with the properties of {@item mithral armor||mithral} or {@item adamantine armor}—but not dramatic in style.": "达卡尼人是霍尔韦尔岛上最优秀的武器制造者，他们的冶金技术甚至超过了坎尼斯家族。他们的传统融合了世俗的技能和嬗变，以创造和操纵非凡的合金，包括金刚砂、米塔尔和比塞克，达卡尼的冠军们经常挥舞着用这种材料锻造的武器。达卡尼人的装备是为耐用和高效而设计的，很少有华丽的或镶有宝石的。同样，盔甲也是坚韧而灵活的--通常具有{@item mithral armor||mithral}或{@item adamantine armor}的属性--但在风格上并不夸张。",
	"Dhakaani magic items are either created by the daashor (who specialize in armor and weapons) or by gifted duur'kala. Dhakaani magic rarely focuses on evocation effects, and they have no tradition of elemental binding. While the Dhakaani lack the wide-scale production capacity of House Cannith, they've had thousands of years to build supplies. Elite units are often equipped with uncommon magic items, such as {@item adamantine armor}, {@item cloak of protection||cloaks of protection}, {@item gauntlets of ogre power}, and {@i vola'khesh} (described in chapter 7). Shaarat'khesh assassins may use {@item hat of disguise||hats of disguise}, {@item bag of holding||bags of holding}, or {@item cloak of elvenkind||cloaks of elvenkind}—though not by that name!—and sometimes more powerful weapons, such as {@item dagger of venom||daggers of venom} or {@i Keeper's fangs} (also in chapter 7). So while the Dhakaani dar are relatively few in number compared to the people of the Five Nations, they're not only disciplined and highly skilled, but also well equipped.": "达卡尼人的魔法物品要么是由达索尔（擅长盔甲和武器）创造，要么是由有天赋的杜尔卡拉创造。达卡尼的魔法很少专注于召唤效果，他们也没有元素绑定的传统。虽然达卡尼人缺乏坎尼斯家族那样大规模的生产能力，但他们已经有数千年的时间来建立供应。精英部队通常装备有不常见的魔法物品，如（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）和（%3%）（在第七章中描述）。Shaarat'khesh刺客可能会使用（4%）、（5%）或（6%）--虽然不是这个名字！--有时还会使用更强大的武器，如（7%）或（8%）（也在第七章）。因此，虽然达卡尼人与五国人民相比，人数相对较少，但他们不仅纪律严明，技术高超，而且装备精良。",
	"When the empire was at its height, the daashor and duur'kala could create grand artifacts and eldritch machines, such as {@i Ghaal'duur} and the {@i grieving tree} presented in chapter 7. The creation of such artifacts was never trivial, and relied on remarkable talents, knowledge lost during the daelkyr incursion, and the use of rare substances and planar conjunctions. As such, while it's possible for the Dhakaani to create new artifacts, they are primarily concerned with recovering and reclaiming ancient treasures forged in the past. The Kech Dhakaan are deeply concerned about how many of their treasures have been claimed by chaat'oor, and react with anger toward other species carrying Dhakaani relics.": "当帝国处于鼎盛时期时，daashor和duur'kala可以创造出宏伟的神器和超自然的机器，例如第七章中介绍的{@i Ghaal'duur}和{@i grieving tree}。创造这样的神器绝非易事，它依赖于非凡的天赋、在达尔凯尔入侵期间失去的知识，以及对稀有物质和平面结合的使用。因此，虽然达卡尼人有可能创造新的神器，但他们主要关注的是恢复和回收过去铸造的古代珍宝。Kech Dhakaan人对他们的宝物被Chaat'oor认领的数量深感忧虑，并对携带Dhakaani遗物的其他物种做出愤怒的反应。",
	"As the Kapaa'vola spread and the Empire of Dhakaan quickly unraveled, many of its greatest leaders sealed their followers in deep vaults. Each of these units took responsibility for preserving one of the pillars of the empire. Together, they called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}—the Keepers of the Empire. The name of each individual clan was given based on their chosen ideal; thus the Kech Volaar are Keepers of the Word, and the Kech Shaarat are Keepers of the Sword. Uul'kala helped to coordinate this effort and to maintain communication between the isolated vaults over time, but there are kech vaults that never had uul'kala, and others who lost their uul'kala over time.": "随着卡帕沃拉的蔓延和达卡安帝国的迅速解体，许多最伟大的领导人将他们的追随者封存在深邃的地窖中。这些单位各自负责保护帝国的一个支柱。他们一起称自己为（%0%）--帝国的守护者。每个部族的名字都是根据他们所选择的理想而命名的；因此，Kech Volaar是文字的守护者，而Kech Shaarat是剑的守护者。Uul'kala帮助协调这种努力，并随着时间的推移保持孤立的金库之间的沟通，但有些金库从来没有Uul'kala，还有一些金库随着时间的推移失去了Uul'kala。",
	"Chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} includes general information about the Heirs of Dhakaan, campaign hooks, and possible NPCs. This section expands on the clans named in that chapter, including descriptions of some Keeper clans that are known or active.

	"Of these clans, both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar have made their presence known in Darguun. But while the Darguuls have heard of these clans, they don't fully understand their origins. The other clans are currently obscure and mysterious, though dramatic action could quickly bring them fame—or infamy.": "在这些部族中，Kech Shaarat和Kech Volaar都已在达尔古纳崭露头角。但是，尽管达尔古尔人听说过这些部族，他们并不完全了解它们的起源。其他部族目前还很模糊和神秘，尽管戏剧性的行动可能会很快给他们带来名声--或者臭名昭著。",
	"While the Dhakaani are renowned for their weaponcraft, it may be surpassed by their skill with fortifications and civic engineering. Many of the greatest cities of the Five Nations are built on Dhakaani foundations, and ruins of other Dhakaani fortresses still linger after many thousands of years. These techniques are the treasure guarded by the Kech Draal, and Draal daashor specialize in the transmutation effects and the shaping of earth and stone. Every kech has its architects, just as the Draal have their soldiers and their duur'kala—but stonework and mining are the pride of the Kech Draal.": "虽然达卡尼人以其武器工艺而闻名，但他们在防御工事和市政工程方面的技能可能超过了他们。五国中许多最伟大的城市都建立在达卡尼人的基础上，而其他达卡尼人堡垒的废墟在几千年后仍在徘徊。这些技术是Kech Draal所守护的宝藏，Draal daashor专门研究嬗变效果以及土石的塑造。每个凯奇都有它的建筑师，就像德拉尔人有他们的士兵和他们的duur'kala一样--但石雕和采矿是凯奇德拉尔人的骄傲。",
	"The Kech Draal have little interest in filling the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come. While they look forward to building the next empire, they have no interest in competing with the other Keepers; they seek only the realization of the dream. They have not yet made their presence felt in the world, and it is up to the DM where their deep vault lies. It's possible that they are beneath Wroat or Korth, secretly dwelling below the deepest foundations of a modern capital.": "Kech Draal人对填补尚未到来的皇帝的宝座没有什么兴趣。虽然他们期待着建立下一个帝国，但他们没有兴趣与其他守护者竞争；他们只寻求梦想的实现。他们还没有在这个世界上崭露头角，至于他们深藏的金库在哪里，就要看DM了。他们有可能在沃洛特或科斯的下面，秘密地居住在现代首都最深的地基之下。",
	"The golin'dar play a more central role in the Kech Draal than in many clans. While the clan is formally led by the dirge singer Kuula Dhakaan and the warlord Druun Dhakaan, the ghaal'dar consult with a golin'dar council on all major decisions. The golin'dar Taala is the senior voice on this council, respected for her wisdom and skill.": "与许多部族相比，戈林达尔在凯奇德拉尔扮演着更为核心的角色。虽然该部族正式由唱哀歌的库拉-达卡安和军阀德鲁恩-达卡安领导，但戈林达尔人在所有重大决策上都会与戈林达尔委员会协商。golin'dar Taala是这个委员会中的资深人士，因其智慧和技能而受到尊重。",
	"The neutrality of the Kech Draal can make them a good choice for a Dhakaani character, as they can find a welcome with any of the Keepers. A Draal character might be gathering information about the world, seeking lost treasure, or even just eager to survey the styles of architecture that have developed over the past millennia.": "Kech Draal的中立性可以使他们成为达卡尼角色的一个很好的选择，因为他们可以在任何一个守护者那里找到欢迎。一个Draal角色可能正在收集关于这个世界的信息，寻找丢失的宝藏，甚至只是渴望调查过去几千年来发展起来的建筑风格。",
	"When the kech sages identified the threat posed by the Kapaa'vola, some chose retreat—hiding in the deep vaults and waiting for the curse to pass. One of their leaders, Khaas Dhakaan, had no interest in hiding. Gathering the greatest heroes of the age—Dhakaani champions, Khesh'dar assassins, Gatekeeper orcs—Khaas led his army into the depths of Khyber, and into the demiplane that served as the prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Khaas swore to end the Treacherous Whisper and to recover artifacts stolen by Dyrrn and its minions—artifacts that Khaas believed could restore the splintering empire.": "当凯奇圣人发现卡帕瓦人构成的威胁时，一些人选择了撤退--躲在深邃的地窖里，等待诅咒的到来。他们的领导人之一，哈斯-达卡安，对躲藏没有兴趣。他召集了这个时代最伟大的英雄--达卡尼冠军、克什达尔刺客、守门兽人--哈斯带领他的军队进入凯博尔的深处，并进入作为腐蚀者迪尔恩监狱的半位面。哈斯发誓要结束奸诈的低语，并找回被迪尔恩及其爪牙偷走的文物--哈斯相信这些文物可以恢复分裂的帝国。",

In truth, they were trapped within Dyrrn's demiplane, fighting an endless struggle against the minions of the daelkyr. Time moves strangely in Dyrrn's realm, and by the reckoning of the Ghaalrac, it has been less than three centuries since they set out on their mission. Trapped in a realm of madness, the Ghaalrac have blended Dhakaani and Gatekeeper techniques with the symbionts of the daelkyr, with results that others might find horrifying. They have crafted powerful living weapons and artifacts, along with magebred champions with unnatural powers—armored bugbears with the regenerative abilities of trolls, goblin assassins with the ability to slip through space. They have found ways to bind aberrations to their will, and have forced beholders and grells to serve them.": "无论是在清醒的世界还是在乌尔-达卡安，卡奥斯和他的冠军们再也没有听到任何消息，人们认为他们已经迷失了。事实上，他们被困在迪尔恩的半位面中，与戴尔基尔的爪牙进行无休止的斗争。时间在Dyrrn的领域里走得很奇怪，根据Ghaalrac的计算，从他们出发执行任务到现在还不到三个世纪。困在一个疯狂的领域里，Ghaalrac将达卡尼和守门人的技术与戴尔克尔的共生体融合在一起，其结果是其他人可能会觉得很恐怖。他们制作了强大的活体武器和人工制品，以及具有非自然力量的魔法战士--具有巨魔再生能力的装甲虫人，具有穿越空间能力的地精刺客。他们已经找到了将反常者束缚在自己的意志之下的方法，并强迫信徒和格莱尔人为他们服务。",

While still driven by the goal of fighting aberrations, after hundreds of years in an alien land, the orcs of the Kech Ghaalrac would seem similarly alien to other Gatekeepers.": "与凯奇-盖拉克一起冒险进入开伯尔的守门兽人的后裔至今仍在，他们作为德鲁伊魔法的专家在氏族的种姓制度中找到了自己的位置。然而，这些曾经的守门人所携带的传统与他们的地面同行有很大的不同，部分原因是他们已经与自然世界隔绝。虽然仍以打击异类为目标，但在异地数百年后，凯奇-盖拉克的兽人对其他守门人来说似乎也很陌生。",
	"Now, after centuries of struggle in Khyber, the Kech Ghaalrac have returned. The current leader—who also uses the name Khaas—possesses what the Ghaalrac call {@i Ur'taash}, the \"First Crown.\" It's said that this was the final creation of Jhazaal Dhakaan, forged to unite the empire; it protects his mind, allows him to communicate with Ghaalrac squads across great distances, and possesses powerful coercive abilities. Khaas claims to have torn this crown from Dyrrn's grip as he dealt a mortal blow to the Corruptor. He believes that it is the Ghaalrac who broke the power of the Treacherous Whisper, and that only they can restore the Empire of Dhakaan.": "现在，在开伯尔经过几个世纪的斗争后，凯奇-盖拉克人回来了。现任领导人--他也使用Khaas这个名字--拥有Ghaalrac人所说的（%0%），\"第一皇冠\"。据说这是贾扎尔-达卡安（Jhazaal Dhakaan）的最后创作，是为了统一帝国而铸造的；它保护着他的思想，使他能够与远距离的加拉克小队沟通，并拥有强大的强制能力。哈斯声称在他对腐蚀者进行致命一击时，从迪尔恩的手中撕下了这顶皇冠。他认为，是盖尔拉克人打破了奸诈的低语的力量，只有他们才能恢复达卡安帝国。",
	"Khaas and the other leaders of the Kech Ghaalrac carry the names of heroes of ancient Dhakaan: Torrm of the Gatekeepers, the master assassin known only as Khesh, the mighty guul'dar Korrga. The original heroes are long dead, but these dar claim to be their descendants and carry their ancient weapons. They possess tremendous power, and they intend to use it. But there are many questions about the Kech Ghaalrac. Are they truly what they claim to be, or have they been corrupted by Dyrrn and turned into tools of the daelkyr, whether they realize it or not? They aren't part of the Uul Dhakaan as experienced by the other Keepers, but they have their own version of the dream that sustained them through the long war, and believe that it is the other clans who have lost sight of the dream. The other Keepers will know nothing of the Kech Ghaalrac until the Clan of Heroes reveals itself; will they support Khaas Dhakaan of their own volition, or be compelled by the power of {@i Ur'taash}? Or will the Heirs of Dhakaan oppose these transformed heroes?": "哈斯和凯奇-盖拉克的其他领导人都有着古代达卡安的英雄的名字。守门人的托尔姆（Torrm），只被称为克什（Khesh）的刺客大师，以及强大的古拉尔-科尔加（guul'dar）。最初的英雄们早已死去，但这些达尔人声称是他们的后代，并携带着他们的古老武器。他们拥有巨大的力量，而且他们打算使用它。但是，关于凯奇-加尔拉克有许多问题。他们是否真的像他们声称的那样，或者他们已经被Dyrrn腐蚀，变成了daelkyr的工具，无论他们是否意识到这一点？他们不是其他守护者所经历的乌尔-达卡安的一部分，但他们有自己版本的梦想，这个梦想支撑他们度过了漫长的战争，并相信是其他部族失去了对梦想的关注。其他守卫者对凯奇-盖拉克一无所知，直到英雄部族显露出来；他们是出于自愿支持凯奇-达卡安，还是被{@i Ur'taash}的力量所蛊惑？或者达卡安的继承人会反对这些变身后的英雄们吗？",
	"The Kech Ghaalrac can appear anywhere that suits the needs of the campaign. When they appear, it should be dramatic. One option is for them to seize the Gathering Stone, House Deneith's fortress in Darguun; this strikes a dramatic blow against chaat'oor and gives the Ghaalrac an opportunity to bend Darguuls to their will. Khaas Dhakaan believes that dar and Darguul alike are all flawed—but that all can be redeemed by the power of Ur'taash.": "Kech Ghaalrac可以出现在任何适合活动需要的地方。当他们出现时，应该是戏剧性的。一个选择是让他们夺取聚集之石，即迪尼斯家族在达尔古恩的堡垒；这对查特奥尔来说是一个戏剧性的打击，也给了盖尔拉克一个让达尔古尔人屈服于他们意志的机会。哈斯-达卡安认为，达尔和达尔古尔都是有缺陷的，但都可以通过乌尔塔什的力量得到救赎。",
	"The Kech Ghaalrac is an unlikely origin for a player character; their story works best when people don't know if they have been corrupted or are righteous, despite their unnatural tools and techniques. However, a Dhakaani character from another kech could be determined to uncover the truth about the Kech Ghaalrac. Or a character could be the distant descendant of one of the Ghaalrac heroes, seeking to learn the final fate of their ancestor and to recover a prized relic from the Ghaalrac champion who carries it.": "Kech Ghaalrac对于玩家角色来说是一个不太可能的起源；他们的故事在人们不知道他们是被腐蚀了还是正直的时候效果最好，尽管他们有非自然的工具和技术。然而，一个来自另一个Kech的Dhakaani角色可以决心揭开Kech Ghaalrac的真相。或者一个角色可能是盖尔拉克英雄之一的远方后裔，寻求了解他们祖先的最终命运，并从带着它的盖尔拉克冠军那里找回一个珍贵的遗物。",
	"Siege warfare and combat engineering are the specialties of the Kech Hashraac. The Dhakaani don't employ siege staffs or evokers, and the Hashraac has spent generations developing new weapons to dominate the battlefield. If the DM wishes to add the conventional firearms and cannons presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to a campaign, the Kech Hashraac could have developed these weapons during their long isolation. Alternatively, the Hashraac could specialize in the enhanced artillery described in chapter 1, alchemical explosives, or an entirely new form of weapon.": "攻城战和战斗工程是凯奇哈什拉克的专长。达卡尼人不采用攻城杖或驱逐者，哈什拉克人花了几代人的时间来开发新的武器，以主宰战场。如果DM希望在战役中加入{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中介绍的常规火器和大炮，那么凯奇-哈什拉克人可以在长期与世隔绝的过程中发展这些武器。或者，哈什拉克人可以专门研究第一章中描述的强化火炮、炼金炸药或一种全新的武器形式。",
	"The Kech Hashraac have yet to reveal their presence to the world at large. While few in number, the force they command could be vital in any conflict that lies ahead. Will they support another kech claiming the imperial throne, or will they pursue it themselves? The warlord Duul Hashraac leads the clan; he is noteworthy both for being a daashor as opposed to a common warrior, and for using his clan name instead of \"Dhakaan\" as his sobriquet. Duul is proud of what his people have achieved; whether he seeks the throne or serves as kingmaker, he believes the Kech Hashraac hold the keys to Dhakaani victory.": "Kech Hashraac还没有向整个世界展示他们的存在。虽然人数不多，但他们指挥的力量在未来的任何冲突中都是至关重要的。他们是支持另一个要求获得帝国王位的凯奇，还是自己追求王位？军阀杜尔-哈什拉克（Duul Hashraac）领导着该部族；他值得注意的是，他是一名达沙尔人，而不是一名普通的战士，而且他使用自己的部族名称而不是 \"达卡安 \"作为自己的绰号。杜尔为他的族人所取得的成就感到自豪；无论他是寻求王位还是担任决策者，他都认为凯奇-哈什拉克人掌握着达卡尼人胜利的钥匙。",
	"The Kech Hashraac are a logical choice for a Dhakaani Artillerist artificer; the artificer's magic can be tied to the tools the DM chooses to provide to these Keepers. A Hashraac player character could be dispatched to study the battle magic of the Five Nations, to seek out rare components needed for new weapons, or to investigate the Mournland and the theory that the Mourning was caused by battle magic. Alternatively, a Hashraac artificer could have left the clan to pursue their own unorthodox weapons research, hoping to return in triumph once they have perfected their techniques.": "Kech Hashraac是达卡尼炮兵工匠的合理选择；工匠的魔法可以与DM选择提供给这些守卫者的工具相联系。一个哈什拉克玩家角色可以被派去研究五国的战斗魔法，寻找新武器所需的稀有部件，或者调查哀伤之地和哀伤是由战斗魔法引起的理论。或者，一个哈什拉克工匠可能已经离开了部落，去追求他们自己的非正统武器研究，希望在他们完善了他们的技术后凯旋而归。",
	"Long ago, interaction with the Aereni line of Vol led to the dirge singer Iraala becoming the first dar vampire. She shared this gift with her lover, the warlord Muurat. In the centuries that passed, the two were placed in charge of the covert operations of the empire. Spying and assassination remained the domain of the Khesh'dar, but the Kech Nasaar served both as internal security and as commandos specializing in guerilla tactics and psychological warfare. It was the Kech Nasaar who first recognized the threat of the Kapaa'vola, and set the Keeper seclusion in motion.": "很久以前，与沃尔的Aereni系的互动导致了哀歌歌手伊拉拉成为第一个达尔吸血鬼。她与她的情人，军阀穆拉特分享了这种天赋。在过去的几个世纪里，这两个人被安排负责帝国的秘密行动。间谍和暗杀仍然是克什达尔人的领域，但凯奇-纳萨尔人既是内部安全人员，也是专门从事游击战术和心理战的突击队员。正是Kech Nasaar首先认识到了卡帕瓦人的威胁，并启动了守护者的隐居计划。",
	"Over their long seclusion, the Kech Nasaar have continued to study unconventional paths of warfare. Nasaar duur'kala often train in the techniques of the bardic College of Whispers, while elite soldiers of the Kech Nasaar might be {@class ranger||Gloom Stalker rangers|gloom stalker|XGE}. Under the leadership of Iraala and Muurat, the Nasaar have also explored the arts of necromancy, though it's up to the DM to decide just how far they've continued down this path. Do they have squads of vampire commandos? Have they developed entirely new forms of undead? Given their penchant for psychological warfare, Nasaar agents could sow terror and confusion by raising the bones of soldiers who died in the Last War, making it seem like the vengeful dead yearned to continue the battle. Or perhaps the Nasaar have developed techniques allowing them to seize control of undead raised by other necromancers—a technique that could cause untold chaos in Karrnath.": "在长期的隐居生活中，凯奇纳萨尔人一直在研究非常规的战争方式。Nasaar duur'kala经常训练吟游诗人学院的技术，而Kech Nasaar的精英士兵可能是（%0%）。在伊拉拉和穆拉特的领导下，纳萨尔人也探索了死灵的艺术，不过这要由DM来决定他们在这条路上走了多远。他们有吸血鬼突击队吗？他们是否开发了全新的亡灵形式？鉴于他们对心理战的偏爱，纳萨尔特工可以通过抬起在最后战争中死去的士兵的骨头来制造恐怖和混乱，让人觉得这些复仇的死者渴望继续战斗。或者，纳萨尔人已经开发出了允许他们控制其他死灵法师养育的亡灵的技术--这种技术可以在卡尔纳特造成巨大的混乱。",
	"Iraala and Muurat continue to lead the clan, giving a direct tie to the ancient empire. The edict of a long-dead emperor asserted that no dead creature could wear the imperial crown; while the services of the Nasaar were valued, the dead are severed from the Uul Dhakaan and cannot draw on the wisdom of the past or see Jhazaal's dream. The Nasaar could have fallen into true darkness in their isolation, and now seek to seize power for themselves. On the other hand, despite being cut off from the Uul Dhakaan, Iraala and Muurat remember the actual glory of the fallen empire, and could be the truest devotees of the concepts of muut and atcha, placing the needs of the empire above their personal ambitions. As in ancient times, they might seek to guide the living emperor, and to ensure the Dhakaani Empire follows the proper course.": "Iraala和Muurat继续领导该部族，使其与古代帝国有着直接的联系。一位早已去世的皇帝的诏书断言，任何死去的生物都不能戴上帝国的王冠；虽然纳萨尔人的服务受到重视，但死者与乌尔-达卡安断绝了联系，不能吸取过去的智慧，也不能看到贾扎尔的梦想。Nasaar可能在与世隔绝中陷入真正的黑暗，现在寻求为自己夺取权力。另一方面，尽管被切断了与乌尔-达卡安的联系，但伊拉拉和穆拉特还记得堕落帝国的实际荣耀，他们可能是穆特和阿查概念的最忠实信徒，将帝国的需求置于个人野心之上。就像在古代一样，他们可能会寻求指导活着的皇帝，并确保达卡尼帝国遵循正确的路线。",
	"A player character from the Kech Nasaar could follow unusual paths. A Nasaar dar might be gathering information for the clan, or they could be tasked to monitor the activities of the other Keepers, especially the Kech Ghaalrac and Kech Shaarat. Iraala may have hidden artifacts across Khorvaire before the fall; a Nasaar character could seek to recover these in her service, or could have gone rogue to pursue one of these treasures.": "一个来自Kech Nasaar的玩家角色可以走不寻常的路。一个Nasaar dar可能在为家族收集信息，或者他们可能被指派去监视其他守护者的活动，特别是Kech Ghaalrac和Kech Shaarat。Iraala可能在堕落之前就在Khorvaire各地隐藏了神器；一个Nasaar角色可以在她的服务下寻求恢复这些神器，也可能是为了追求这些宝藏而叛变。",
	"Beasts served many important roles in the Empire of Dhakaan. The Ruuska dar fill much the same role that House Vadalis does for the Five Nations: tending and training the many beasts of the empire, while always searching for—or creating—new beasts to fill a need. {@i Ruuska} is the Goblin word for \"tiger,\" and tigers and dire tigers are often used as cavalry in the vanguard of Dhakaani armies. But the Kech Ruuska breed all manner of beasts, from fierce guardians to clever messengers and simple livestock.": "野兽在达卡安帝国扮演着许多重要角色。鲁伊斯卡达尔的作用与瓦达里斯家族对五国的作用基本相同：照顾和训练帝国的众多野兽，同时一直在寻找或创造新的野兽来满足需求。{@i Ruuska}是哥布林语中 \"老虎 \"的意思，老虎和猛虎经常被用作达卡尼军队的先锋部队的骑兵。但凯奇-鲁伊斯卡人饲养各种类型的野兽，从凶猛的守护者到聪明的信使和简单的牲畜。",
	"Just as there are soldiers in every kech, there are tenders in every vault who maintain the beasts of that vault. However, the Kech Ruuska specialize in breeding and training them, producing the finest Beast Master rangers, and keeping the widest range of exotic creatures in their arsenals. The Ruuska also work with magebreeding and may have produced entirely new beasts or monstrosities previously unknown on the surface. While the Ruuska don't have a spiritual bond to the natural world, they might have developed a form of druid—a Moon druid serving as a specialist in assuming animal forms and controlling beasts. The Ruuska have also experimented with lycanthropy. It's up to the DM to decide if they were able to control and weaponize the curse, if their efforts ultimately came to nothing, or if lycanthropy has spread throughout the Ruuska—a secret they are concealing from the other clans.": "就像每个凯奇都有士兵一样，每个金库都有维护该金库的野兽的补给员。然而，Kech Ruuska专门从事繁殖和训练它们，生产最好的野兽大师游侠，并在他们的武库中保留最广泛的异国生物。鲁伊斯卡人还致力于魔力繁殖，并可能生产出全新的野兽或怪兽，这些都是以前在地面上不为人知的。虽然鲁伊斯卡人与自然界没有精神上的联系，但他们可能已经发展出一种德鲁伊--一个月球德鲁伊，作为拥有动物形态和控制野兽的专家。鲁伊斯卡人也曾试验过狼人的行为。如果他们能够控制诅咒并将其武器化，如果他们的努力最终一无所获，或者如果狼人症已经蔓延到整个鲁伊斯卡--一个他们对其他部族隐瞒的秘密，那就由DM决定。",
	"The Kech Ruuska are led by the Beast Master warlord Lhaar Dhakaan and the duur'kala Oruul. The Kech Shaarat are putting considerable pressure on the Ruuska to support their claim to the crown. It remains to be seen if Lhaar bows to these threats, or whether the Ruuska seek an alliance that lets them turn the tables on the powerful Shaarat.": "Kech Ruuska由野兽大师军阀Lhaar Dhakaan和duur'kala Oruul领导。Kech Shaarat对Ruuska施加了相当大的压力，以支持他们对王位的要求。Lhaar是否会向这些威胁低头，或者鲁伊斯卡是否会寻求一个联盟，让他们与强大的沙拉特人翻脸，这都有待观察。",

The clan can also be an interesting way to add new or exotic beasts or monstrosities into the world, and could be an intriguing foil for a storyline involving House Vadalis.": "凯奇-鲁伊斯卡是达卡尼游侠的一个不错的选择。该部族也是一种有趣的方式，可以将新的或异国的野兽或怪兽加入到这个世界中，并且可以成为涉及瓦达里斯家族的故事情节的一个有趣的衬托。",

Founded by the Warlord of the South in the final days of the empire, the Shaarat possess an artifact known as Skai Shaarat—the Great Blade—a sword handed down from warlord to warlord since the days of the Six Kings. While they lack the exotic specialties of the other clans, the Kech Shaarat excel at war. The deep vault of the Kech Shaarat is tied to a demiplane in Khyber known as the Ironlands. This provided them with access to resources and space denied to the other clans, including the byeshk ore the Dhakaani prize for their weapons (as presented in chapter 7), while also keeping them on a constant war footing. Of all the Keepers, the Kech Shaarat have the finest Forge Adept artificers (a new specialization presented in chapter 6), as well as talented Battle Smiths—though the Dhakaani don't generally employ constructs, these artificers have created innovative steel defenders. On the other hand, the Kech Shaarat have not emphasized the role of the duur'kala as much as other clans, and have a weaker bardic tradition.": "Kech Shaarat是最大的守卫者部族。由南方军阀在帝国最后的日子里建立，Shaarat拥有一件被称为Skai Shaarat的神器--大刀--一把自六王时代以来从军阀传到军阀的剑。虽然他们缺乏其他部族的异国特产，但凯奇-沙哈拉特人擅长战争。凯奇-沙拉特的深层金库与开伯尔的一个被称为铁地的半位面联系在一起。这为他们提供了其他部族所无法获得的资源和空间，包括达卡尼人奖励给他们的武器的byeshk矿石（如第七章所介绍的），同时也使他们一直处于战争状态。在所有的守护者中，Kech Shaarat拥有最优秀的锻造专家工匠（第六章介绍的新专业），以及有天赋的战斗工匠--尽管达卡尼人一般不使用构造物，但这些工匠已经创造了创新的钢铁防御者。另一方面，Kech Shaarat没有像其他部族那样强调duur'kala的作用，并且有一个较弱的吟游诗人传统。",
	"The Kech Shaarat have emerged into the open and are the most active of the Dhakaani tribes. The warlord Ruus Dhakaan (no relation to the Kech Ruuska, though his name does mean \"Tiger\") has reclaimed several ancient Dhakaani fortresses in the Seawall Mountains, and is working to refortify these ruins. In the course of this expansion, the Kech Shaarat have already absorbed a lesser clan—the Kech Nozhii, who maintained the treasury of the empire—which has expanded their resources. They are actively pressuring the Kech Ruuska to submit to an alliance acknowledging Ruus as the Emperor Yet to Come, and Shaarat warriors have a bitter rivalry with the Kech Volaar.": "Kech Shaarat人已经出现在公开场合，是达卡尼部落中最活跃的。军阀鲁斯-达卡安（Ruus Dhakaan）（与凯奇-鲁斯卡没有关系，尽管他的名字确实是 \"老虎 \"的意思）已经收复了海堤山脉的几个古代达卡尼堡垒，并正在努力重新加固这些废墟。在这一扩张过程中，凯奇-沙拉特已经吸收了一个较小的部族--凯奇-诺兹伊，他们维持着帝国的国库，这扩大了他们的资源。他们积极向凯奇-鲁伊斯卡施压，要求其加入承认鲁伊斯为未来皇帝的联盟，而沙拉特的战士与凯奇-沃拉尔有激烈的竞争。",

Ruus hasn't revealed the true nature of his people or the full scale of his forces to the Ghaal'dar, and most Darguuls believe the Kech Shaarat are a Ghaal'dar clan with strange traditions. House Deneith is keen to gain the services of these mysterious warriors, but Ruus Dhakaan refuses to have any dealings with the chaat'oor. Ruus Dhakaan is a brilliant strategist and charismatic leader. He earned {@i Skai Shaarat} with his courage and skill, and should never be underestimated. While he's determined to claim the imperial throne, he's also concerned with muut and the good of the empire; he will pressure other Keepers to support his claim, but won't butcher his own kind. However, he's ruthless when it comes to dealing with chaat'oor, and doubts whether the modern \"goblins\" can be redeemed. They may be close enough to dar that they could be worthy servants, but he's considering whether it's simpler to slaughter the Darguuls once the dar are united.": "Ruus已经派代表到Rhukaan Draal，并承诺支持Lhesh Haruuc，但这是一个旨在等待时间和衡量敌人的诡计。鲁斯还没有向盖尔达尔透露他的人民的真实性质和他的全部势力规模，大多数达尔古尔人认为凯奇沙拉特是一个有着奇怪传统的盖尔达尔部族。德尼兹家族热衷于获得这些神秘战士的服务，但鲁伊斯-达卡安拒绝与恰特奥尔人有任何往来。鲁斯-达卡安是一位杰出的战略家和富有魅力的领导人。他以自己的勇气和技巧赢得了{@i Skai Shaarat}，永远不应该被低估。虽然他决心夺取帝国的王位，但他也关心穆特和帝国的利益；他会向其他守卫者施压以支持他的要求，但不会屠杀自己的同类。然而，当涉及到处理Chaat'oor时，他是无情的，并怀疑现代 \"妖精 \"是否可以被救赎。他们可能足够接近达尔，可以成为值得信赖的仆人，但他正在考虑一旦达尔联合起来，屠杀达尔古尔人是否更简单。",
	"The Kech Shaarat are the most aggressive of the clans, and this is an interesting option for an entire party of dar adventurers.

The monks of the Kech Uul are devoted to protecting the dream from outside influences, but they're also experts in navigating the dream itself; if a Dhakaani dreamer is searching for a particular memory or wishes to speak with the dreamvestige of an ancient hero, a Kech Uul monk can be an invaluable guide. Likewise, the uul'kala of the Dream Keepers are the backbone of long-distance communication between clans; the uul'kala maintain message stations at various points within the dream, and can pass a message from one dreamer to another.": "Kech Uul人还没有回到Khorvaire的表面。他们的人大部分时间都在Uul Dhakaan本身，使用药物和冥想来进入梦境，甚至在醒来的时候。Kech Uul的僧侣们致力于保护梦境不受外界影响，但他们也是驾驭梦境本身的专家；如果达卡尼的梦者正在寻找一段特殊的记忆，或希望与古代英雄的梦遗体对话，Kech Uul的僧侣可以成为一个无价的向导。同样，守梦人的uul'kala是部族间长途通信的骨干；uul'kala在梦境中的各个点维持着信息站，并能将信息从一个梦者传递给另一个梦者。",
	"There are several ways that the Kech Uul could fit into a campaign. They can serve as a neutral resource supporting all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance through the dream. However, it could be that they're not what they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect Jhazaal's dream from outside influences, but it's possible the clan has been partially or fully replaced by quori imposters, who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the ends of the Dreaming Dark. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was destroyed long ago by the daelkyr or another threat; the Dream Keepers continue to serve their function, but they're actually long dead, and the chot'uul encountered in the Uul are simply dream-vestiges, memories lingering in Dal Quor.": "Kech Uul可以通过几种方式融入到一个活动中。他们可以作为一个中立的资源支持所有的部族，通过梦想保持沟通并提供指导。然而，他们可能并不像他们看起来那样。Kech Uul一直致力于保护Jhazaal的梦境不受外界影响，但有可能该部族已经部分或全部被Quori冒名顶替，他们计划影响尚未到来的皇帝，为黑暗梦境的目的服务。也可能Kech Uul在很久以前就被daelkyr或其他威胁摧毁了；守梦人继续发挥着他们的作用，但他们实际上早就死了，而在Uul中遇到的chot'uul只是梦的遗迹，在Dal Quor徘徊的记忆。",
	"The name of the Kech Uul's current leader is unknown outside the clan. Uul dar often wear masks or veils; they do not seek atcha, and desire only to help others achieve Jhazaal's dream.": "凯奇-乌尔族目前的领导人的名字在族外不为人知。乌尔达尔经常戴着面具或面纱；他们不寻求阿查，只希望帮助别人实现贾扎尔的梦想。",
	"A player character tied to the Uul dar could be an uul'kala, a bard (likely of the College of Glamour) pursuing a dream-vision or searching for dream-related artifacts. An exotic possibility is that the character believes it's possible to bring other species into the Uul Dhakaan, allowing for a peaceful union; if this is the case, is this goal supported by the clan elders, or is the character an eccentric renegade? Alternatively, any dar character could have a mentor from the Uul dar, who visits them in their dreams offering guidance and inspiration.": "一个与乌尔达卡联系在一起的玩家角色可能是一个乌尔卡拉，一个追求梦境的吟游诗人（可能是魅力学院的）或寻找与梦境有关的文物。一个异乎寻常的可能性是，这个角色相信有可能将其他物种带入Uul Dhakaan，从而实现和平的结合；如果是这样的话，这个目标是否得到部落长老的支持，或者这个角色是一个古怪的叛逆者？另外，任何达尔角色都可以有一个来自乌尔达尔的导师，他在梦中拜访他们，提供指导和灵感。",
	"The Kech Volaar believe that knowledge is power. Their deep vault holds scrolls and tablets recording thousands of years of imperial history.

	"While the Volaar weaponsmiths aren't a match for those of the Kech Shaarat, the clan leaders recognize the value of arcane magic over pure mundane might. The Volaar have long worked to push the limits of duur'kala magic, and to master the techniques that created wonders such as the Uul Dhakaan and the greatest artifacts of the old empire. The Volaar have experimented with warlocks—working with supernatural patrons under carefully controlled conditions—and sought to cultivate sorcerers when they have appeared among the dar populace. Since their return to the surface, the Kech Volaar are working both to recover the greatest artifacts and treasures of the empire, and to study the arcane techniques of the modern gath'dar. Where the Kech Shaarat believe that Dhakaani might can sweep aside any enemy, the Volaar recognize the arcane power wielded by the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and are doing everything they can to study and master this unfamiliar science.": "虽然沃拉尔的武器工匠无法与凯奇-沙拉特的武器工匠相比，但族长们认识到奥术的价值高于纯粹的世俗力量。长期以来，沃拉尔人一直致力于突破duur'kala魔法的极限，并掌握创造奇迹的技术，如Uul Dhakaan和旧帝国最伟大的神器。沃拉尔人对术士进行了实验--在精心控制的条件下与超自然的赞助人一起工作，并在达尔人中出现巫师时寻求培养他们。自从他们回到地面后，凯奇-沃拉尔人正在努力恢复帝国最伟大的文物和宝藏，并研究现代gath'dar的神秘技术。凯奇-沙拉特人相信达卡尼人的力量可以横扫任何敌人，而沃拉尔人则认识到五国和龙纹屋所挥舞的奥术力量，并竭尽全力研究和掌握这一陌生的科学。",
	"Perhaps because of this, the Kech Volaar are also the most conciliatory of the Keeper clans. They are the most willing to interact with the gath'dar, both because they recognize the need to understand these possible enemies, and in the hopes that some form of coexistence may be possible. Like the Kech Uul, Volaar leader Tuura Dhakaan wonders if the Uul Dhakaan can expand to incorporate other creatures—if the empire can unite gath'dar as it does the dar.": "也许正因为如此，凯奇-沃拉尔也是守护者部族中最具有和解性的。他们最愿意与加斯达尔人交流，因为他们认识到需要了解这些可能的敌人，并希望有可能实现某种形式的共存。就像Kech Uul一样，Volaar的领导人Tuura Dhakaan想知道Uul Dhakaan是否能扩展到其他生物--如果帝国能像对待达尔人一样团结gath'dar。",

They are the Keepers of History, and they know the sacrifices their ancestors had to make and the bitter wars against the chaat'or and the {@i taarn} (elves). They are wise and willing to seek all paths to prosperity, but will never surrender the dream of the eternal empire.": "尽管有这些希望，凯奇-沃拉尔人对达尔的奉献高于一切。他们是历史的守护者，他们知道他们的祖先不得不做出的牺牲，以及与恰特人和（%0%）（精灵）的痛苦战争。他们是明智的，愿意寻求所有的繁荣之路，但永远不会放弃永恒的帝国之梦。",
	"Tuura Dhakaan has revealed herself to the world, and has sent representatives to the court of Lhesh Haruuc. Like the Kech Shaarat, the Volaar have concealed their true history and power. Volaar duur'kala often travel among the Ghaal'dar sharing stories, helping to educate them about their glorious past and the traditions of muut and atcha; this ties to Tuura's hopes that the \"goblins\" can be redeemed and drawn back to their past glory. Tuura is determined to claim the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come; she hopes to find the strength needed to compel the Kech Shaarat through reclaiming powerful artifacts and building allies.": "图拉-达卡安已经向世界表明了自己的身份，并派代表前往勒什-哈鲁克的宫廷。与凯奇沙拉特人一样，沃拉尔人也隐瞒了他们的真实历史和权力。Volaar duur'kala经常在Ghaal'dar中旅行，分享故事，帮助他们了解他们光荣的过去以及muut和atcha的传统；这与图拉希望 \"妖精 \"能够被救赎并被吸引回他们过去的荣耀联系在一起。图拉决心夺取尚未到来的皇帝的宝座；她希望通过夺回强大的文物和建立盟友，找到迫使凯奇沙拉特的力量。",
	"The Kech Volaar are one of the most active Dhakaani clans. Adventurers could encounter Volaar reclaimers across Khorvaire as they search for Dhakaani relics. A Volaar wizard or artificer could be struggling to master the techniques of the gath'dar, while a duur'kala could be an envoy sent to recover an ancient treasure or to seek allies among the outsiders.": "凯奇-沃拉尔是最活跃的达卡尼部族之一。冒险者在搜索达卡尼遗物时，可能会在霍尔韦尔各地遇到沃拉尔开垦者。沃拉尔的巫师或工匠可能正在努力掌握gath'dar的技术，而duur'kala则可能是被派来回收古代宝藏或在外来者中寻求盟友的特使。",
	"Under Dhakaani tradition, the golin'dar—goblins—are traditionally laborers and artisans. While the guul'dar and ghaal'dar train for war, the golin'dar maintain the hearth. But there is a force that stands outside this tradition, lurking in the shadows of the Dhakaani Empire. These are the {@i Khesh'dar}—the Silent Folk—golin'dar who use their speed and cunning as spies, scouts, and assassins.": "根据达卡尼的传统，戈林达尔--哥布林--传统上是劳动者和工匠。当Guul'dar和Ghaal'dar为战争进行训练时，Golin'dar则负责维护炉灶。但是有一股力量站在这个传统之外，潜伏在达卡尼帝国的阴影中。这些人是{@i Khesh'dar}--沉默的人民--戈林达尔，他们利用自己的速度和狡猾作为间谍、侦察员和暗杀者。",
	"While the Khesh'dar are part of the Uul Dhakaan, they have always remained separate from its traditions. They have always served the emperor and their warlords, but they do so in their own time. Their refuges have always been hidden, even before the Kapaa'vola. The ascetic Khesh'dar aren't compelled by money or power; they choose when to offer aid, and set a fair price on their services. The Khesh'dar take no sides in disputes between clans, and they do not seek to rule; in the present day they serve both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar. However, they don't accept missions that they see as threatening the empire itself; as a result, they rarely accept a charge to kill a warlord or a duur'kala.": "虽然Khesh'dar人是Uul Dhakaan的一部分，但他们一直与它的传统保持分离。他们一直为皇帝和他们的军阀服务，但他们在自己的时间内这样做。他们的避难所一直都是隐蔽的，甚至在卡帕奥沃拉之前也是如此。苦行僧Khesh'dar并不为金钱或权力所迫；他们选择何时提供援助，并为他们的服务设定一个公平的价格。Khesh'dar在部族之间的争端中不偏袒任何一方，他们也不寻求统治；在今天，他们同时为Kech Shaarat和Kech Volaar服务。然而，他们不接受他们认为威胁到帝国本身的任务；因此，他们很少接受杀死军阀或duur'kala的指控。",
	"Because of this long tradition of secrecy, even the warlords of the Kech Dhakaan don't know where the vaults of the Khesh'dar are located, or just how many of the Silent Folk are out there. Goblins are spread throughout Khorvaire and most of the great cities of the Five Nations have significant goblin populations, and this provides an easy opportunity for the Khesh'dar to move freely throughout the modern world without drawing attention. The Khesh'dar have been active throughout the last century, spying on the chaat'oor and building up resources and safe houses across the Five Nations. They've recruited many eyes among the modern city goblins and the goblins of Darguun, though these contacts rarely understand exactly who they are dealing with. The Khesh'dar likewise have spies and agents among the golin'dar of every Keeper clan, ensuring that there are few secrets hidden from the Silent Folk.": "由于这种长期的保密传统，即使是凯奇达卡安的军阀也不知道Khesh'dar的金库在哪里，或者到底有多少沉默的民兵在那里。妖精遍布霍尔韦尔，五国的大多数大城市都有大量的妖精人口，这为Khesh'dar提供了一个轻松的机会，可以在整个现代世界自由移动而不引起注意。Khesh'dar在上个世纪一直很活跃，他们监视Chaat'oor，并在整个五国建立了资源和安全屋。他们在现代城市的地精和达尔古恩的地精中招募了许多眼线，尽管这些眼线很少了解他们到底在和谁打交道。Khesh'dar同样在每个守卫者部族的golin'dar中都有间谍和代理人，确保没有什么秘密可以瞒过沉默的民俗。",
	"The Khesh'dar are split into two primary traditions. The Taarka'khesh (\"Silent Wolves\") are swift scouts, experts in wilderness reconnaissance and targeted strikes. The Taarka'khesh typically rely on worg cavalry; many develop an unusual primal bond with their worg companions, and the golin'dar view the worgs as partners, not beasts. Though worgs don't have an innate tie to the Uul Dhakaan, the Beast Master rangers of the Taarka'khesh can summon their worg companions to them while dreaming.": "Khesh'dar分为两个主要传统。Taarka'khesh（\"沉默的狼\"）是迅速的侦察兵，是野外侦察和目标打击的专家。Taarka'khesh通常依靠虫族骑兵；许多人与他们的虫族同伴建立了不寻常的原始联系，而戈林达尔人将虫族视为伙伴，而不是野兽。虽然虫族与乌尔-达卡安（Uul Dhakaan）没有天生的联系，但塔尔卡赫什（Taarka'khesh）的野兽大师游骑兵可以在做梦时将他们的虫族同伴召唤过来。",
	"The second Khesh'dar tradition is that of the Shaarat'khesh (\"Silent Blades\"), spies and assassins trained to operate within cities. Both usually operate covertly, disguised to blend in with the local goblin population. However, each order has a distinctive half-mask that is worn over the lower face during formal interactions.": "第二个Khesh'dar的传统是Shaarat'khesh（\"无声之刃\"），这些间谍和刺客被训练成在城市中行动。两者通常都是秘密行动，伪装成与当地的地精人口融为一体。然而，每个教团都有一个独特的半面罩，在正式交往时戴在下脸。",
	"It's up to the DM to decide just how widespread the Khesh'dar are. They may have a single deep vault and only a few hundred operatives, or it could be that they are the largest of the Dhakaani clans, with outposts hidden across Khorvaire. They may have been building networks for thousands of years, simply waiting for the Keepers to rise before putting these resources to use. But are they truly content to serve any emperor? Or do the Khesh'dar have a hidden agenda of their own? Is it possible that they're tied to the Lords of Dust... or even to the dragons of the Chamber?": "Khesh'dar的范围有多广，这取决于DM的决定。他们可能只有一个深库和几百名特工，也可能是达卡尼家族中最大的一个，他们的前哨站隐藏在整个Khorvaire。他们可能已经建立了数千年的网络，只是在等待守护者的崛起，然后将这些资源投入使用。但他们真的满足于为任何皇帝服务吗？还是赫斯达尔人有他们自己的隐藏计划？他们是否有可能与尘土领主......甚至与商会的龙联系在一起？",
	"The Khesh'dar could serve as an espionage agency patron for a group of golin'dar adventurers. More likely, a single character could be an undercover operative of the Khesh'dar, either pursuing a deep, long-term mission or simply gathering intelligence while waiting for specific orders. It's not unusual for the Khesh'dar to seek to cultivate useful allies among the gath'dar. It would be unusual for one of the Khesh'dar to explain their traditions to an outsider, but it's not impossible that a Khesh'dar could form a bond to a gath'dar comrade over the course of their adventures.": "Khesh'dar可以作为一群Golin'dar冒险者的间谍机构的赞助人。更有可能的是，一个角色可以成为Khesh'dar的卧底，要么追求一个深入的、长期的任务，要么只是在等待具体命令时收集情报。Khesh'dar寻求在gath'dar中培养有用的盟友，这并不罕见。一个克什米尔人向外人解释他们的传统是不寻常的，但克什米尔人在冒险的过程中与加斯达尔人的同志建立起联系也不是不可能。",
	"Members of the Kech Dhakaan can be found across the world, seeking information, relics, and pursuing the goals of their people. They can be deadly foes—or unexpected allies against a common foe. While most of the characters on the {@table Dhakaani NPCs|ExploringEberron} table aren't spies, they won't volunteer information about their people or background unless they come to know and trust someone; generally, they allow others to believe that they're from an obscure Darguun clan.": "Kech Dhakaan的成员在世界各地都能找到，他们寻求信息、遗物，并追求他们的人民的目标。他们可以是致命的敌人，也可以是对抗共同敌人的意外盟友。虽然{@table Dhakaani NPCs|ExploringEberron}表上的大多数人物都不是间谍，但他们不会主动提供关于自己民族或背景的信息，除非他们认识并信任某人；一般来说，他们会让别人相信他们来自一个不起眼的达官氏族。",
	"For the Kech Dhakaan emerging from their vaults, the modern world is a waking nightmare. Modern goblinoids are hollow mockeries of the true dar. Foul chaat'oor hold the lands of the empire and pillage the treasures of the People. But the dar still have their dream. They know what the world should be, and know that together, somehow, they can defy the chaat'oor and restore the eternal empire. However, a long path lies ahead. The dar are badly outnumbered, and can't take on all of the Five Nations in open combat. They don't yet understand the enemy or know what they're capable of. The Kech Volaar, in particular, realize the power of the wide magic of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and recognize they need to know more. There's also the question of whether there's any hope for the modern goblinoids. Can they be instilled with Dhakaani values? Or are they no better than chaat'oor?": "对于从地窖里走出来的凯奇-达卡人来说，现代世界是一场清醒的噩梦。现代的妖精是真正的达尔的空洞的嘲弄。肮脏的Chaat'oor占据着帝国的土地，掠夺着人民的财物。但达尔人仍然有他们的梦想。他们知道这个世界应该是什么样子的，并且知道，他们一起，以某种方式，可以打败查特奥尔，恢复永恒的帝国。然而，前面有一条漫长的道路。达尔人人数众多，不可能在公开的战斗中对付所有的五国人。他们还不了解敌人，也不知道他们有什么能力。尤其是凯奇-沃拉尔人，他们意识到了五国和龙纹屋的广泛魔法的力量，并认识到他们需要了解更多。还有一个问题是，现代地精是否有任何希望。他们能被灌输达卡尼的价值观吗？还是他们比Chaat'oor好不了多少？",
	"Only a new emperor can make this decision. But the last emperor was lost to the Kapaa'vola before the Kech Dhakaan descended into the depths, and no single kech has the power to create a new emperor. The duur'kala speak of the Emperor Yet To Come, with the belief that once all the Keepers rise, a single emperor will somehow win universal acclaim, uniting them all against the chaat'oor. But whether they be lhesh, duur'kala, or daashor, it's unclear what will bring this to pass.": "只有一个新的皇帝才能做出这个决定。但在Kech Dhakaan坠入深渊之前，上一任皇帝已被Kapaa'vola夺走，没有任何一个Kech有能力创造一个新皇帝。duur'kala人谈论的是 \"尚未到来的皇帝\"，他们相信一旦所有的守护者崛起，一个单一的皇帝将以某种方式赢得普遍的赞誉，将他们全部联合起来对抗Chaat'oor。但无论他们是Lhesh、duur'kala还是daashor，都不清楚什么会使这一切成为现实。",
	"The Kech Uul believe that when a single dar has the support of the majority, the Uul Dhakaan will reveal them—that the emperor will be proclaimed and crowned within the universal dream. But even if true, what will trigger this? The Kech Shaarat believe that power will determine the emperor. They have already absorbed the Kech Nozhii and are pressuring the Kech Ruuska, using a combination of force and fear to convince the smaller clans that the path to victory lies through uniting under a single clan. The Kech Shaarat would prefer not to kill other dar, but Ruus Dhakaan is willing to take steps to prove his power and right to lead, and Shaarat and Volaar agents have clashed in the field.": "凯奇-乌尔人相信，当一个单一的达尔得到大多数人的支持时，乌尔-达卡安将揭示他们--皇帝将在普遍的梦想中被宣布并加冕。但是，即使是真的，什么会引发这种情况？Kech Shaarat认为，权力将决定皇帝。他们已经吞并了Kech Nozhii，并正在向Kech Ruuska施压，利用武力和恐惧的结合来说服小部族，通向胜利的道路在于团结在一个部族之下。凯奇-沙拉特宁愿不杀其他达尔，但鲁斯-达卡安愿意采取措施来证明他的权力和领导权，沙拉特和沃拉尔的特工在战场上发生了冲突。",
	"Tuura Dhakaan of the Kech Volaar is following a different path as she pursues the crown. She seeks to recover lost artifacts, reminding the dar of their glory while also amassing powerful tools. There are a few she is especially keen to find: {@i Ur'taash}, the First Crown; {@i Guulen}, the Rod of Kings; and {@i Ghaal'duur}, the horn of Jhazaal Dhakaan. {@i Ur'taash} is currently in the possession of the Khesh Ghaalrac, though its authenticity is in question. The whereabouts of {@i Guulen} and {@i Ghaal'duur} remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the Kech Shaarat remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the Kech Volaar believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.": "凯奇-沃拉尔的图拉-达卡安（Tuura Dhakaan）在追求王位的过程中走的是一条不同的道路。她寻求找回丢失的文物，提醒达尔人他们的荣耀，同时也积累了强大的工具。有几个是她特别想找到的。{@i Ur'taash}，第一王冠；{@i Guulen}，国王之棒；{@i Ghaal'duur}，贾扎尔-达卡安的角。 {@i Ur'taash}目前在凯什-加拉克手中，尽管其真实性受到质疑。{@i Guulen}和{@i Ghaal'duur}的下落仍然不明。除此之外，图拉正在评估现代世界，努力看看其他人是否能成为有用的盟友。因此，尽管凯奇-沙拉特仍然相信这场冲突仅仅是基于达尔内部的主导地位，但凯奇-沃拉尔认为，对现代世界的了解对于任何长期的成功都是至关重要的。",
	"Other Keepers may devise their own paths to winning allies or the throne, and there may be Keeper clans that have yet to be revealed. For now, the Kech Dhakaan are focused on gathering information and competing among themselves. Once they unite behind a single leader, they'll have to decide how to deal with the Darguuls, the dragonmarked houses, and the Five Nations.": "其他守护者可能会设计出他们自己的道路来赢得盟友或王位，而且可能还有一些守护者的部族尚未被揭示。目前，凯奇-达卡恩人专注于收集信息和彼此之间的竞争。一旦他们团结在一个领导者的身后，他们将不得不决定如何处理达尔古尔人、龙纹屋和五国的关系。",
	"There are a few factors to consider when creating a dar character. This section examines questions about the story—What's your clan? What's your background? In addition, chapter 6 presents three new racial options for Dhakaani player characters, along with two new class archetypes associated with the Dhakaani: the Forge Adept artificer specialist, and the bardic College of the Dirge Singer.": "在创建一个Dar角色时，有几个因素需要考虑。本节研究关于故事的问题--你的部族是什么？你的背景是什么？此外，第6章为达卡尼玩家角色提供了三个新的种族选择，以及与达卡尼相关的两个新的等级原型：锻造专家（Forge Adept artificer specialist）和吟游诗人（Dirge Singer）学院。",
	"The Dhakaani are among the most effective and elite forces on Khorvaire. They possess excellent training and techniques, exceptional discipline, and masterful equipment. If you're in a campaign where characters are starting at a higher level, this isn't an issue. But what if you're starting at level 1? Dhakaani fighters are often Battle Master or Samurai fighters in {@item adamantine armor}, but you don't gain your archetype until you've been adventuring outside your kech for several levels. Here are four ideas of how to explain the inconsistency:": "达卡尼人是霍尔韦尔岛上最有效和最精锐的部队之一。他们拥有优秀的训练和技术，卓越的纪律和精湛的装备。如果你的战役中的角色是从较高的级别开始的，这就不是一个问题。但如果你是从1级开始的呢？达卡尼战士通常是战斗大师或武士的{@item adamantine armor}，但你要在你的凯奇之外冒险了几个等级才会获得你的原型。以下是如何解释这种不一致的四个想法。",
	"You don't have your traditional equipment, and it takes you a little time to get used to working with this inferior gear. You're not used to working with chaat'oor; they don't respond to your obvious cues, and their behavior constantly confuses you. The wide sky above is extremely disorienting, as you've spent much of your life underground. And worst of all is the {@i smell}. It's going to take you a few adventures to get your groove back.": "你没有你的传统装备，你需要一点时间来适应这种劣质装备的工作。你不习惯与Chaat'oor一起工作；他们对你明显的提示没有反应，他们的行为不断使你困惑。上面宽阔的天空让人极度迷失方向，因为你大部分时间都在地下生活。而最糟糕的是（%0%）。你需要经过几次冒险才能恢复你的状态。",
	"You've suffered a significant physical or psychological injury and it's going to take you a while to recover. Frankly, after everything you've been through, it's impressive that you're even capable of functioning as well as you do. Is it a mundane injury, or something more exotic? Maybe you were possessed by a quori for a few years and you're still reclaiming your identity. Or perhaps you were struck by shards of an exploding dragonshard; once you're fully recovered, might those same slivers explain some of your unusual class abilities?": "你遭受了重大的身体或心理伤害，你将需要一段时间来恢复。坦率地说，在你所经历的一切之后，你甚至能够像现在这样运作良好，这令人印象深刻。是普通的伤害，还是更奇特的东西？也许你被夸父附身了几年，你仍然在恢复你的身份。或者你被爆炸的龙石的碎片击中；一旦你完全康复，这些碎片可能会解释你一些不寻常的能力？",
	"Most clans don't want the world to know their full history and capabilities. You would rather be mistaken for a Darguul or city goblin, and are keeping a low profile. You don't have {@i adamantine armor} because it would raise questions, and you intentionally conceal your full capabilities until you trust your fellow adventurers enough to reveal your true talents.": "大多数部族不希望世人知道他们的全部历史和能力。你宁愿被误认为是达古尔人或城市妖精，并保持低调。你没有（%0%），因为这会引起质疑，你故意隐瞒你的全部能力，直到你对你的冒险者同伴有足够的信任，才会暴露你的真实才能。",
	"All of your training up to this point has set you on this path; your past life experience readied you for the new skills you're learning today. You underwent endless training while in your kech, but the pieces didn't click into place until you spent time fighting in the field. One month of adventuring didn't trump a decade of intense training, but it helped to trigger it.": "到目前为止，你所有的训练都使你走上了这条道路；你过去的生活经历为你今天所学的新技能做好了准备。你在凯奇时经历了无尽的训练，但直到你花时间在战场上战斗时，这些碎片才会被点击到位。一个月的冒险并没有胜过十年的密集训练，但它有助于触发它。",
	"Ultimately, this is all about creating a story to carry you through your first few adventures. It doesn't have to be a flawless explanation, just use your imagination and keep adventuring; soon, you'll reach level 3!": "归根结底，这都是为了创造一个故事，让你度过最初的几次冒险。它不必是一个完美无缺的解释，只要发挥你的想象力，继续冒险；很快，你就会达到第三级",
	"The dar went into hiding thousands of years ago to avoid the Kapaa'vola. They have only recently emerged from those deep vaults and reclaimed fortresses on the surface. As a dar character, you were surely born in one of the deep vaults and indoctrinated into the traditions of your clan. Consider the following questions about your character's origins:": "几千年前，为了躲避卡帕阿沃拉人，达尔人躲了起来。他们最近才从那些深藏的地窖里出来，在地表上开垦出堡垒。作为一个达尔人的角色，你肯定是出生在一个深窖里，并被灌输了你的部族的传统。请考虑以下关于你的角色起源的问题。",
	"Are you one of the Kech Volaar, or are you a hermit from the Kech Uul? Consider the list of clans from the previous section and see which works best for the story you want to tell.": "你是凯奇-沃拉尔族的一员，还是凯奇-乌尔族的隐士？考虑一下上一节的部族名单，看看哪个最适合你想讲的故事。",
	"The Dhakaani are armies, working with limited resources and absolute focus. Everyone had a function to perform, likely reflected by your background and your class. What training did you receive, and what was the purpose of that training? Were you a soldier? Were you being prepared for a military specialty (possibly reflected by your choice of archetype)? If you're a bard, were you trained to inspire troops on the battlefield or were you primarily a diplomatic envoy? You wouldn't have been pushed into a role unless you showed an aptitude for it—but did you like the role you were given, or was it a path you had to follow?": "达卡尼人是军队，以有限的资源和绝对的专注来工作。每个人都有自己的职能，可能由你的背景和你的阶级反映出来。你接受了什么训练，训练的目的是什么？你是一名士兵吗？你是否正在为军事专业做准备（可能反映在你选择的原型上）？如果你是一个吟游诗人，你接受的训练是为了在战场上激励部队，还是主要作为外交使节？除非你表现出有这方面的才能，否则你不会被推入一个角色--但你喜欢你被赋予的角色吗，或者说这是你必须遵循的道路？",
	"Despite the demands of muut and the shaping influence of the Uul Dhakaan, every dar is a unique individual with their own passions and drives. Ultimately, what do you most care about? Do you believe in the dream of the Dhakaani Empire? Do you want to become the next emperor, or do you simply want to help your people thrive? Have you rejected the bond of muut and turned your back on the empire? Or are you seeking atcha and chasing a personal story—a quest for vengeance against the defiling chaat'oor, or completing the ancient vow of an ancestor? The {@table Dhakaani Departures|ExploringEberron} table suggests some reasons a dar might leave their clan.": "尽管有muut的要求和Uul Dhakaan的塑造影响，但每一个飞镖都是一个独特的个体，有自己的激情和动力。归根结底，你最关心的是什么？你相信达卡尼帝国的梦想吗？你想成为下一个皇帝，还是你只是想帮助你的人民繁荣发展？你是否拒绝了muut的纽带，背弃了帝国？还是你在寻求atcha，追逐一个个人的故事--寻求对玷污的Chaat'oor的复仇，或者完成祖先的古老誓言？{@table Dhakaani Departures|ExploringEberron}表提出了一些达尔人可能离开他们部族的原因。",
	"Your clan and character motivations often suggest a logical choice for your background. However, certain background features don't make much sense for a Dhakaani character. Soldier is a logical background for a dar fighter, but your Military Rank feature is unrecognized outside your clan. Likewise, it makes sense for a golin'dar from the Kech Draal to have the skills of a guild artisan, but you don't have membership in any guild known in the Five Nations.": "你的部族和人物动机往往表明你的背景是一个合理的选择。然而，某些背景特征对达卡尼人来说并没有什么意义。士兵是达卡尼战士的合理背景，但你的军衔特征在你的部族之外是不被承认的。同样，对于来自Kech Draal的Golin'dar来说，拥有公会工匠的技能是有意义的，但是你在五国中没有任何公会成员资格。",
	"Your background can be used to reflect your current mission as opposed to your basic training. If you're operating undercover, you might have been taught the skills of a charlatan and set up with a solid False Identity, even if you're a plainspoken soldier at heart. As a Shaarat'khesh monk, the urchin background can reflect your training and familiarity with cities, even though you were never an abandoned child. As one of the Kech Uul, the hermit background could represent your long isolation in Jhazaal's dream—and your Discovery could be a revelation you found in the dream, whether it concerns the future of the empire or something of even greater import.": "你的背景可以用来反映你目前的任务，而不是你的基本训练。如果你在做卧底，你可能被传授了骗子的技能，并被设置了一个可靠的假身份，即使你的内心是一个朴实的士兵。作为一个Shaarat'khesh僧侣，顽童的背景可以反映出你的训练和对城市的熟悉程度，即使你从来都不是一个被抛弃的孩子。作为Kech Uul中的一员，隐士的背景可以代表你在Jhazaal的梦中长期与世隔绝，而你的发现可能是你在梦中发现的启示，无论它是关于帝国的未来还是更重要的东西。",
	"Chapter 6 includes two variant background features for use with Dhakaani characters of any background. In addition, the {@table Dhakaani Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table below suggests simple items that your character might carry from their past; your DM might let you select one of these as your trinket, or to substitute it for another small item from your background equipment. What's its story? Why do you carry it today?": "第6章包括两个可变的背景特征，可用于任何背景的达卡尼人角色。此外，下面的{@table Dhakaani Trinkets|ExploringEberron}表格建议了你的角色可能从他们的过去携带的简单物品；你的管理员可能会让你选择其中一个作为你的饰品，或者用你的背景装备中的另一个小物品代替它。它有什么故事？你今天为什么要带着它？",
	"Some classes and archetypes are common among Dhakaani dar, while others aren't as likely. Here are some suggestions of interesting characters you might play for each class.": "一些等级和原型在达卡尼人中很常见，而其他的则不太可能。这里有一些你可能扮演的每个等级的有趣角色的建议。",
	"The Kech Dhakaan call their artificers daashor. The talent of artifice is rare, and some of the greatest secrets of the past were lost to the Kapaa'vola. Dhakaani artificers typically focus on the creation of arms and armor, taking the Forge Adept archetype, provided in chapter 6, or the Battle Smith archetype. Artillerist artificers are generally only found in the Kech Hashraac. The Kech Volaar are actively seeking to unlock the arcane traditions of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and a Volaar artificer could follow any archetype with the idea that you are blazing new trails through your work. While the most legendary daashor were male ghaal'dar, there are no gender or race restrictions for this role, and golin'dar often show a talent for artifice.": "Kech Dhakaan人称他们的工匠为daashor。工匠的天赋是罕见的，过去一些最伟大的秘密被卡帕奥瓦人所遗忘。达卡尼人的工匠通常专注于武器和盔甲的制造，采用第六章提供的锻造专家原型，或战斗史密斯原型。炮兵工匠一般只在凯奇-哈什拉克发现。凯奇-沃拉尔积极寻求解开五国和龙纹屋的奥术传统，沃拉尔工匠可以遵循任何原型，认为你在通过你的工作开辟新的道路。虽然最传奇的daashor是男性ghaal'dar，但这个角色没有性别或种族限制，golin'dar经常表现出工匠的天赋。",
	"It's unusual for ghaal'dar to follow the path of the barbarian, and unheard of for golin'dar. However, the guul'dar—bugbears—are taught that their strength is the strength of the empire, and guul'dar warriors typically serve as the terrifying vanguard of a Dhakaani army. This path can be represented by the barbarian, but with an important story difference—guul'dar barbarians aren't savages, and they don't surrender to unthinking rage. Instead, guul'dar \"rage\" is a cultivated surge of adrenaline and combat awareness, not unlike the Fighting Spirit of the Samurai fighter. The Path of the Totem Warrior is the common choice for guul'dar barbarians; the choice of totem doesn't reflect a primal spirit, but rather specialized combat training. If your DM approves of this concept, you might even be able to replace the 10th-level Spirit Walker feature with the Intimidating Presence of the Berserker barbarian, as it's difficult to explain how commune with nature is tied to your military training.": "Ghaal'dar走野蛮人的道路是不寻常的，而Golin'dar则闻所未闻。然而，guul'dar-bugbears-被教导说他们的力量就是帝国的力量，guul'dar战士通常作为达卡尼军队的可怕的先锋。这条道路可以由野蛮人代表，但有一个重要的故事差异--古尔邦德野蛮人不是野蛮人，他们不会向不假思索的愤怒投降。相反，guul'dar的 \"愤怒 \"是一种经过培养的肾上腺素和战斗意识的激增，与武士的战斗精神不一样。图腾战士之路是guul'dar野蛮人的共同选择；图腾的选择并不反映一种原始精神，而是专门的战斗训练。如果你的管理员认可这个概念，你甚至可以用狂暴野蛮人的 \"威慑力 \"来取代10级的 \"精神行者 \"特征，因为很难解释与自然的交流是如何与你的军事训练相联系的。",
	"Bards play a central role in Dhakaani culture, serving as spiritual leaders and taking the role that priests fill in many other cultures. However, Dhakaani bards inspire and guide the people using tales of the past and the dream of the future, as opposed to priests seeking the favor of divine forces. Bards are also found as diplomats, civic leaders, and healers, and are the primary spellcasters in Dhakaani society. The most common bards are the {@i duur'kala} (dirge singers); as a duur'kala, you'll likely want to follow the College of the Dirge Singer included in chapter 6, or perhaps the College of Lore. The duur'kala of the Kech Nasaar may choose the College of Whispers, while the uul'kala dream singers may follow the College of Glamour. Most clans have a strongly ingrained tradition that only female ghaal'dar can serve as duur'kala. However, player characters are exceptional, and it's always possible to defy this tradition.": "吟游诗人在达卡尼文化中起着核心作用，作为精神领袖，承担着其他许多文化中祭司的角色。然而，达卡尼的吟游诗人用过去的故事和未来的梦想来激励和引导人们，而不是像祭司那样寻求神圣力量的青睐。吟游诗人也是外交官、公民领袖和治疗师，并且是达卡尼社会的主要施法者。最常见的吟游诗人是{@i duur'kala}（哀歌者）；作为一个杜尔卡拉，你很可能想跟随第六章中的哀歌者学院，或者是传说学院。Kech Nasaar的duur'kala可以选择私语学院，而uul'kala的梦想歌手可以跟随魅力学院。大多数部族都有一个根深蒂固的传统，即只有女性Ghaal'dar可以担任duur'kala。然而，玩家角色是特殊的，总是有可能违背这一传统。",
	"The Dhakaani are a martial culture, and this is their greatest strength. Dhakaani combat techniques have been honed over thousands of years, blended with the natural instincts and exceptional discipline of the Dhakaani soldier. Both the Champion and Battle Master archetypes are appropriate for all Dhakaani fighters. The Samurai archetype is primarily found with the Kech Shaarat, and is a ghaal'dar variation of the guul'dar barbarian technique. Cavaliers are tied to the tiger cavalry, and are especially common in the Kech Ruuska. Within most clans, fighter training is reserved for male ghaal'dar. However, player characters can certainly challenge this stereotype.": "达卡尼人是一种武术文化，这也是他们最大的优势。达卡尼人的战斗技巧经过数千年的磨练，与达卡尼士兵的自然本能和卓越纪律相融合。冠军和战斗大师的原型都适合于所有达卡尼战士。武士的原型主要见于Kech Shaarat，是guul'dar野蛮人技术的ghaal'dar变种。骑士与老虎骑兵联系在一起，在凯奇-鲁伊斯卡尤其常见。在大多数部族中，战士训练是为男性ghaal'dar保留的。然而，玩家角色当然可以挑战这种刻板印象。",
	"Monks are rare among the Kech Dhakaan, but not unknown. The most widespread monastic tradition is the {@i shaarat'dor} (literally, \"No Sword\") technique of the Khesh'dar. Practitioners can focus on the physical art by following the Way of the Open Hand, or they can blend this with the Shaarat'khesh arts of stealth by choosing the Way of Shadow. The Khesh'dar are exclusively golin'dar, but an exceptional character of another race might be taken in by the Silent Folk. The other established monastic tradition is that of the chot'uul (Dream Watchers). Most of the chot'uul blend mental and martial discipline, and typically follow the {@class monk||Kensei|kensei|XGE} path. Others learn how to manipulate reality as one might shape a dream; these chot'uul might follow the Way of the Four Elements. Most chot'uul are part of the reclusive Kech Uul, but most kech vaults have a small, dedicated group of dream guardians.": "僧侣在克赫达卡人中很少见，但也不是没有。最广泛的僧侣传统是克什达尔的（%0%）（字面意思是 \"无剑\"）技术。练习者可以通过遵循 \"张手之道 \"专注于身体艺术，也可以通过选择 \"阴影之道 \"将其与 \"沙拉特 \"的隐身艺术结合起来。Khesh'dar是专门的Golin'dar，但其他种族的特殊人物可能会被沉默的民俗所接纳。另一个既定的寺院传统是chot'uul（守梦人）。大多数chot'uul融合了精神和武术的纪律，并且通常遵循（1%）的路径。其他人则学习如何操纵现实，就像人们塑造一个梦一样；这些chot'uul可能遵循四元素之道。大多数chot'uul是隐居的Kech Uul的一部分，但大多数Kech vaults都有一个小的、专门的梦想守护者团体。",
	"The golin'dar of the Taarka'khesh are legendary scouts and skirmishers, the most common rangers among the Dhakaani. However, guul'dar and ghaal'dar may also train as skirmishers. Typically, the cavalry are Beast Master rangers, working with worgs or tigers. Skirmishers are often {@class ranger||Hunters|hunter} or {@class ranger||Gloom Stalkers|gloom stalker|XGE}.": "Taarka'khesh的golin'dar是传奇的侦察兵和小兵，是达卡尼人中最常见的游骑兵。然而，guul'dar和ghaal'dar也可以作为小兵训练。通常情况下，骑兵是野兽大师游骑兵，与虫族或老虎一起工作。小兵通常是（%0%）或（%1%）。",
	"Typically, the Kech Dhakaan face their foes in open combat. The arts of the rogue are the domain of the Khesh'dar goblins, who operate in the shadows of the empire. While the Shaarat'khesh are best known for their assassins, specialists can be found following almost any archetype. The Silent Folk train and can dispatch Thieves when necessary. Arcane Tricksters have adapted a form of the duur'kala's magic. And if you're using {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, Inquisitive rogues are the top spies of the Khesh'dar, while a handful of Masterminds serve as expert strategists. It's entirely possible to run a campaign around a team of Shaarat'khesh rogues with different specialties, with the Khesh'dar serving as an espionage patron. Outside of the Khesh'dar, the Kech Nasaar are the only clan that regularly trains ghaal'dar spies and assassins.": "通常情况下，凯奇-达卡人在公开战斗中面对他们的敌人。流氓的艺术是克什达尔地精的领域，他们在帝国的阴影中活动。虽然沙拉特克什人以他们的刺客而闻名，但几乎可以找到遵循任何原型的专家。沉默的民兵们在必要时可以训练和派遣盗贼。奥术师改编了duur'kala的一种魔法形式。如果你使用的是{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}，好奇的流氓是克什达尔的顶级间谍，而少数大师级人物则是专家级战略家。完全可以围绕一队具有不同专长的Shaarat'khesh流氓开展活动，由Khesh'dar作为间谍赞助人。在赫什达尔家族之外，凯奇-纳萨尔家族是唯一一个定期训练加尔达尔间谍和刺客的部族。",
	"At the height of the Empire of Dhakaan, the only common spellcasters were artificers and bards. Focused on martial discipline, the Dhakaani never unlocked the secrets of wizardry or embraced eldritch bargains—but today, the Kech Volaar are actively trying to bridge this gap in their arsenal. As a Volaar wizard, you can follow any path; the key is that you are likely a trailblazer and your accomplishments and discoveries may be very important to your people. There is no established tradition of sorcery among the Dhakaani, but the Volaar are likewise seeking out any dar who show signs of sorcerous potential. The clan has even been experimenting with warlocks, actively seeking out arcane patrons and attempted controlled studies. So as a Volaar warlock, you might be the first dar to work with this particular patron, and your superiors are eager to see how it turns out.": "在达卡尼帝国的鼎盛时期，唯一常见的施法者是工匠和吟游诗人。由于专注于武术训练，达卡尼人从未解开过巫师的秘密，也没有接受过长生不老的交易--但今天，凯奇-沃拉尔人正在积极努力弥补他们武器库中的这一空白。作为一名沃拉尔巫师，你可以走任何道路；关键是你可能是一个开拓者，你的成就和发现可能对你的人民非常重要。达卡尼人中没有既定的巫术传统，但沃拉尔人同样也在寻找任何显示出巫术潜力的达尔。该部族甚至一直在用术士做实验，积极寻找奥术赞助人并尝试进行控制性研究。因此，作为一个沃拉尔术士，你可能是第一个与这个特殊赞助人合作的达尔，而你的上级也很想看看结果如何。",
	"There are a few other options for arcane spellcasters. Depending on the path the DM decides to take with the Kech Hashraac, they could be training Evokers; like the Volaar wizards, this would reflect cutting-edge research. The Kech Nasaar have been studying necromancy for a long time and may have developed Necromancer wizards. The Nasaar are more willing than most to dally with sinister powers, and it's likewise possible that they've had a tradition of warlocks.": "对于奥术施法者还有一些其他选择。根据DM决定对凯奇-哈什拉克采取的路径，他们可能正在训练Evokers；就像沃拉尔的巫师一样，这将反映出最前沿的研究。Kech Nasaar已经研究死灵法术很长时间了，可能已经开发了死灵法师巫师。纳萨尔人比大多数人更愿意与邪恶的力量打交道，同样，他们也有可能有术士的传统。",
	"The general mindset of the dar is ill-suited to the abstract concept of faith, whether in higher powers or the world itself. They believe in the past. They believe in their leaders. But they don't believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate. It is possible to play a Dhakaani paladin who draws their divine power from their absolute devotion to the empire, or a cleric who channels power from the Uul Dhakaan. But this was always intended as an intentional gap in the capabilities of the Dhakaani: they have far greater martial skill than most of the cultures of Khorvaire, but they simply don't have access to divine magic.": "达人的普遍心态不适合抽象的信仰概念，无论是对更高的权力还是对世界本身。他们相信过去。他们相信他们的领导人。但他们不相信有控制命运的宇宙力量或预言。有可能扮演一个从对帝国的绝对奉献中汲取神力的达卡尼圣骑士，或者一个从乌尔-达卡安那里输送力量的牧师。但这一直是达卡尼人能力中的一个有意的差距：他们的武术技能远远超过霍尔韦尔的大多数文化，但他们根本无法获得神圣的魔法。",
	"Chapter 6 presents new racial traits for Dhakaani goblinoids. If you're playing a dar, your racial traits are determined by whether you're a golin'dar (goblin), ghaal'dar (hobgoblin), or guul'dar (bugbear). The terms goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear are part of the Common tongue, introduced by human settlers. While most modern goblinoids have adopted these terms themselves, the dar maintain the old ways.": "第6章介绍了达卡尼妖精的新种族特性。如果你扮演的是达尔，你的种族特征是由你是戈林达尔（地精）、加尔达尔（妖精）还是古尔达尔（虫熊）决定的。术语 \"哥布林\"、\"哥布林 \"和 \"虫子 \"是通用语的一部分，由人类定居者引入。虽然大多数现代的地精都自己采用了这些术语，但达尔人仍然保持着古老的方式。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} provided racial traits for goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, but those represent the modern goblinoids, denizens of Darguun and Droaam whose ancestors were touched by the Kapaa'vola of Dyrrn the Corruptor. While the goblinoids of the Kech Dhakaan—the {@i dar}—are physically identical to their modern cousins, there are some important differences. The dar are bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system. As one of the dar, you know your place in society and have undergone intense training to hone your natural strengths. The racial traits in chapter 6 reflect that training, but if you were raised outside of Dhakaani society, you should instead use the standard goblinoid traits.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}提供了地精、妖精和虫族的种族特征，但这些代表了现代的地精，是达尔古恩和德罗安的居民，他们的祖先被腐败者迪尔恩的卡帕'沃拉触及。虽然Kech Dhakaan--{@i dar}--的妖精族在身体上与他们的现代表亲相同，但有一些重要的区别。达尔人被穆特和阿查的哲学以及乌尔-达卡人的精神联系结合在一起。他们的生活是由无情的武术文化和僵化的种姓制度塑造的。作为达尔人中的一员，你知道自己在社会中的地位，并经历了激烈的训练，以磨练自己的天赋优势。第6章中的种族特征反映了这种训练，但如果你是在达卡尼社会之外长大的，你应该使用标准的地精族特征。",

Don't believe me? Go take a look at the Face of Mror! No one could carve something like that, my friend; that's the mountain's original face. As for the others, well, they just went to sleep face down. That's the tale I had from my father, and you wouldn't want to call him a liar!": "Tol kollan! 有人说我们的祖先来自一个冰的地方，但我们都知道那是无稽之谈。我们的祖先是山脉本身。龙嫉妒他们强大的身材，所以他们施了一个咒语，让他们都睡着了，这就是山的来历。我们矮人？我们是他们额头上的汗水。不相信我？去看看莫尔的脸吧! 没有人能雕刻出这样的东西，我的朋友；那是山的原始面貌。至于其他人，嗯，他们只是脸朝下睡去了。这是我从我父亲那里得到的故事，你不会想说他是骗子吧！？",
	"Despite their long lives, the Mror dwarves are surprisingly unconcerned with recording the past. They care deeply about family. They cling to property, whether it's land or more portable possessions. They're fierce in protecting the things that they care about. But as the bard Kessler said, \"The Mror care deeply about their stories, but facts just get in the way.\" Mror talespinners have an endless supply of stories about the mighty deeds of clan heroes, but when it comes to specific dates or verifiable facts, things often get muddy. Records of debts, marriages, adoptions—these things are written down by Sivis scribes. But general history is largely trusted to the passed-down tales of the spinners, and they make history {@i interesting}. A particular story could be placed in three different centuries by three different clans, and the villain of one tale could be the hero in the neighboring holdfast.": "尽管他们的寿命很长，但Moror矮人却出奇地不关心记录过去。他们非常关心家庭。他们紧紧抓住财产，无论是土地还是更多的便携物品。他们猛烈地保护他们所关心的东西。但正如吟游诗人凯斯勒所说，\"Moror人非常关心他们的故事，但事实却阻碍了他们。梭罗族的故事家们有无穷无尽的关于氏族英雄的强大事迹的故事，但当涉及到具体日期或可核实的事实时，事情往往变得很复杂。债务、婚姻、收养的记录--这些东西都由西维斯的文士写下来。但一般的历史在很大程度上被信任于纺纱工的传世故事，他们创造了历史（%0%）。一个特定的故事可以由三个不同的部族放在三个不同的世纪里，一个故事里的恶棍可能是邻近的坚守里的英雄。",
	"Dwarves aren't native to Khorvaire, but no one knows exactly how or when they arrived. Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that's enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization—or ruins of it—waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there's no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.": "矮人并不是霍尔韦尔的原住民，但没有人确切知道他们是如何或何时到达的。大多数纺纱师都同意矮人来自冰和霜的土地，尽管从本节开头的序言中可以看出，并非所有故事都同意。虽然这对Mror来说已经足够了，但其他学者仍在争论他们可能来自哪里，以及他们是如何来到霍尔韦尔的。最流行的理论是，第一批矮人来自冰霜之城，通过凯博尔的半位面通道旅行。这个观点的支持者认为，在冰霜之城可能有一个未被发现的矮人文明--或者是它的遗迹--等待着被发现。第二个流行的理论是，矮人起源于萨洛纳的塔沙纳苔原，在人类定居者之前的几千年，他们航行到霍尔韦尔并在拉扎尔公国登陆。然而，现代Akiak矮人与Moror的文化几乎没有重叠，也没有证据表明他们曾经建造过船只。最奇特的故事是，萨洛纳和霍尔韦尔的矮人都来自里西亚，而且在里西亚的冰层深处可能还隐藏着一个伟大的文明。虽然各个部族的起源故事各不相同，但讲故事的人都同意随后出现的Moror历史的广泛时代。",
	"Wherever the dwarves came from, they sunk their roots into the soil of Khorvaire. Dhakaani dirge singers sing of battles between dwarf and dar that took place in vast halls below the earth. Dhakaani records—which are more accurate than those of the dwarves—show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn't worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call {@i Sol Udar}, the Realm Below.": "无论矮人从哪里来，他们都把根扎进了霍尔韦尔的土壤。达卡尼人的哀歌歌手唱出了矮人和达尔之间的战斗，这些战斗发生在地底巨大的大厅里。达卡尼人的记录--比矮人的记录更准确--显示达卡尼人在达卡尼帝国的黄金时代后期遇到了矮人，并将他们赶到了东部，最终达成了僵局。古代矮人缺乏威胁达卡尼的数量或资源，但他们在铁根山下建立了一条防线，并在无数次的进攻中守住了这条防线。达尔人不需要这块领土，而且随着时间的推移，他们认为征服的努力并不值得回报。这就是矮人所说的{@i Sol Udar}，下面的境界的起源。",
	"The next major era in Mror history was {@i Mallanok}, the Exile. At some point—whether years or centuries later is unclear—a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn't decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known.": "姆罗尔历史上的下一个重要时代是（%0%），流放。在某个时刻--是多年后还是几个世纪后还不清楚--一群矮人战士被放逐出地下世界，并与他们的家人和追随者一起在山上找到了新家。流放的原因取决于你问谁。莫洛伦的故事家们说，索尔乌达的国王莫洛无法决定他的13个继承人中哪个应该继承他的王位，所以他把这些英雄推到山上，以证明自己配得上他的王国。索多拉克人说，摩尔国王是个软弱的暴君，他流放这十三位英雄是因为他害怕起义。科兰伯格的梅里安-米特-达万迪教授提出了一个理论，即古代矮人可能将罪犯流放到地表世界，而不是维持监狱，而摩尔庄园的创始人是各种各样的罪犯和不受欢迎的人。真相被埋藏在几千年的重压之下，可能永远不会被发现。",
	"The Exile was followed by {@i Dul Krok}, Bloody Stones. When humanity came to Khorvaire, the Ironroot Mountains were divided between thirteen powerful clans of dwarves. These mountain dwarves were proud and warlike, but they were mired in feuds—and these ancient conflicts kept them from substantially advancing their culture or their influence in the world. Even as humans spread across the land, the dwarves continued to devote their energy and resources to their own ongoing vendettas. While they were unquestionably fierce warriors and made fine weapons, their deep division prevented any progress. The Ironroot dwarves weren't the only dwarves on Khorvaire; some had spread east into what's now the Lhazaar Principalities. It was largely these Lhazaar dwarves who integrated with humanity, spreading west with them, though there were also a few Mror who left their feuds behind to help build the foundations of the new kingdoms.": "放逐者之后是{@i Dul Krok}，血色石头。当人类来到霍尔韦尔的时候，铁根山被13个强大的矮人部族所分割。这些山地矮人骄傲而好战，但他们深陷于世仇之中--这些古老的冲突使他们无法实质性地推进他们的文化或他们在世界上的影响力。即使人类在这片土地上传播，矮人也继续将他们的精力和资源投入到他们自己正在进行的仇杀中。虽然他们无疑是凶猛的战士，也制造了精美的武器，但他们深刻的分裂阻碍了任何进步。铁根矮人并不是霍尔韦尔岛上唯一的矮人；一些矮人已经向东扩散到现在的拉扎尔公国。主要是这些Lhazaar矮人与人类融合在一起，与他们一起向西传播，尽管也有一些Moror留下了他们的恩怨，帮助建立新王国的基础。",
	"As the Five Nations took form, humanity largely shunned the Ironroot Mountains and left the dwarves to their feuding. Following the rise of the united kingdom of Galifar, Prince Karrn finally made a concerted effort to pacify the mountain dwarves. This time is known as {@i Bal Dulor}, the Great Sorrow. The soldiers of Galifar were disciplined and took advantage of the existing feuds, isolating the clans or pitting them against one another. The central fortresses of the holds were impregnable, but Galifar held the surrounding lands; the compromise that followed left the dwarves as lords of their territories, but as subjects of Galifar, forced to pay tribute and taxes.": "随着五国的形成，人类在很大程度上回避了铁根山，而让矮人去争斗。随着加利法尔统一王国的崛起，卡尔恩王子终于做出了协调一致的努力来安抚山区矮人。这段时间被称为{@i Bal Dulor}，大悲痛。加利法尔的士兵们纪律严明，利用现有的恩怨，孤立各部族或使其相互对立。碉堡的中心要塞坚不可摧，但加利法尔却掌握着周围的土地；随后的妥协使矮人成为其领土的领主，但却成为加利法尔的臣民，被迫缴纳贡品和税收。",
	"The Mror Holds occupy the mountainous region that separates Karrnath from the Lhazaar Principalities. The Mror dwarves occupy this entire region, and they call it {@i tra Mroreln}, the Iron Roots. When humans first came to Khorvaire and settled the Lhazaar Principalities, they called the foreboding range to the west the Hoarfrost Mountains.": "姆罗尔大区占据了将卡尔纳特与拉扎尔公国分开的山区。Mror矮人占据了这整个地区，他们称之为（%0%），铁根。当人类第一次来到霍尔韦尔并在拉扎尔公国定居时，他们把西边的不祥山脉称为霍尔弗罗斯特山脉。",
	"Today, the Mror and most others refer to the entire region as the Ironroot Mountains. However, the people of the Lhazaar Principalities still call them the Hoarfrost, and some people use this term to refer to the mountains east of Mirror Lake.": "今天，摩尔人和其他大多数人都把整个地区称为铁根山。然而，拉扎尔公国的人民仍然称它们为胡尔弗罗斯特，有些人用这个词来指称镜湖以东的山脉。",
	"While the Great Sorrow was a source of deep shame to the dwarves, it brought a forced end to their violent feuds and forced them to raise the funds to pay their tribute. Warriors became miners, and the Ironroot Mountains proved to be an astonishingly rich source of mineral wealth. Mror talespinners say that the Sovereign Onatar had his forge in the mountains, and that Kol Korran kept his hoard beneath it; other scholars have speculated that there could be a more unsavory supernatural force at work, an overlord tied to greed bound beneath the peaks. Whatever the truth, this led to the period known as {@i Korran Hal}, Korran's Blessing. Even with the taxes owed to Galifar, the Mror prospered and built a thriving society. While the ancient feuds were never forgotten, violence was no longer their first answer. The bearers of the Dragonmark of Warding, Clan Kundarak, were drawn into the Twelve and became House Kundarak. Working closely with House Sivis, Kundarak parleyed its wealth and the power of its dragonmark to establish the Banking Guild, and the influence of Kundarak helped to drive a further wave of cultural advancement.": "虽然 \"大悲 \"让矮人深感羞耻，但它使他们被迫结束了激烈的争斗，并迫使他们筹集资金来支付贡品。勇士们变成了矿工，而铁根山被证明是一个惊人的丰富的矿物财富来源。姆罗尔的故事家们说，君主奥纳塔在山上有他的锻造厂，科尔-科兰把他的囤积物放在山下；其他学者推测，可能有一种更不光彩的超自然力量在起作用，一个与贪婪捆绑在山峰之下的霸主。无论真相如何，这导致了被称为{@i Korran Hal}，Korran的祝福的时期。即使欠下了加里法尔的税款，摩尔人仍然兴旺发达，建立了一个繁荣的社会。虽然古代的恩怨从未被遗忘，但暴力不再是他们的第一答案。守护龙纹的持有者昆达拉克氏族被吸引到十二宫中，成为昆达拉克家族。昆达拉克与西维斯家族紧密合作，利用其财富和龙纹的力量建立了银行公会，而昆达拉克的影响力也帮助推动了文化的进一步发展。",
	"As the dwarves expanded their mines and fortress holds, they'd occasionally find tunnels and outposts that seemed to be tied to Sol Udar—outposts that appeared to have been abandoned many thousands of years ago. The dwarves continued to dig deeper toward the Realm Below, and this led to a wave of breakthroughs in the early tenth century, an event broadly known as {@i tra Halor}, the Revelation. Miners and masons found evidence of a vast, wondrous subterranean empire, with enormous city-halls below all of the modern holds. Early explorers found finely crafted treasures, along with evidence of even deeper mines and fortresses. It was clear that these cities had been built by dwarves, and it speaks to Mror character that rather than pondering the fate of the builders of this abandoned realm, the dwarves simply embraced this as a miraculous stroke of fortune and proof of their collective destiny.": "随着矮人扩大他们的矿场和要塞，他们偶尔会发现一些似乎与索尔-乌达有关的隧道和前哨--这些前哨似乎在几千年前就被抛弃了。矮人继续朝下界深入挖掘，这导致了十世纪初的一波突破，这一事件被广泛称为{@i tra Halor}，启示。矿工和石匠们发现了一个巨大的、奇妙的地下帝国的证据，在所有的现代建筑下面有巨大的城市大厅。早期的探险家们发现了制作精良的宝物，以及更深的矿井和堡垒的证据。很明显，这些城市是由矮人建造的，这说明了莫尔的性格，即矮人并没有思考这个被遗弃的王国的建造者的命运，而是简单地接受了这一奇迹般的幸运之举和他们集体命运的证明。",
	"By this time, the Last War was underway. For the last decade, Karrnath had been steadily raising taxes and demanding troop levies. But the dwarves were conquered long ago by {@i Galifar}, whereas Karrnath was just a piece of that broken kingdom. Inspired by Sol Udar and recognizing how far their people had come since the Great Sorrow, the lords of the holds convened in {@i Mror Aulan}, the Iron Council. The lords of the Iron Council affirmed their union and declared the sovereignty of {@i Mror Solu}—the Realms of Iron—a name which even the Mror themselves usually translate into Common as the Mror Holds. It's worth noting that in calling themselves the Mror, dwarves aren't professing fealty to Clan Mroranon or the ancient king of Sol Udar; rather, they're simply calling themselves \"the Ironfolk.\"": "此时，最后一场战争正在进行中。在过去的十年里，卡尔纳特一直在稳步提高税收，要求征收军队。但矮人在很久以前就被{@i Galifar}征服了，而卡尔纳特只是那个破碎王国的一块。在索尔-乌达的激励下，认识到他们的人民自大悲咒以来已经取得了很大的进步，各领地的领主在{@i Mror Aulan}召开了铁议会。铁之议会的领主们确认了他们的联合，并宣布了{@i Mror Solu}--铁之国的主权--这个名字甚至连摩尔人自己都通常将其翻译成通用的摩尔大区。值得注意的是，矮人称自己为 \"Moror\"，并不是向Mororanon氏族或Sol Udar的古代国王宣誓效忠；相反，他们只是称自己为 \"铁民\"。",
	"The time that followed was initially known as {@i Aul Aur}, the Age of Gold. While Karrnath engaged in retaliatory actions during the Last War, it was struggling with famine and against its neighbors, and lacked the power to stop the rebellion. The dwarves expanded and explored Sol Udar, reclaiming wondrous relics and facilities. But soon they learned what had become of the ancient dwarves of the Realm Below, and why the kingdom had never reached up to the exiles. The ancient dwarves had been wiped out thousands of years ago by the daelkyr, for Sol Udar abutted on the demiplane prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor, one of the mightiest of the daelkyr. The first explorers found curious tools formed from flesh and bone—and then they discovered the creatures that made them. Dolgrim hordes rose from the depths. Entire colonies were lost and consumed by illithid corruption. While the Five Nations fought the Last War, the Mror fell into {@i Dol Udar}, the War Below, discussed in more detail later in \"The Realm Below\" section.": "随后的时间最初被称为（%0%），即黄金时代。虽然卡尔纳斯在最后一次战争中参与了报复行动，但它正与饥荒和邻国作斗争，缺乏阻止叛乱的力量。矮人扩张并探索了索尔乌达，夺回了奇妙的遗物和设施。但很快他们就了解到下界的古代矮人变成了什么样子，以及为什么王国从未向流亡者伸出援手。古老的矮人在几千年前就被达尔凯尔人消灭了，因为索尔乌达紧邻腐蚀者迪尔恩的半位面监狱，是达尔凯尔人中最强大的一个。第一批探险者发现了由肉和骨形成的奇怪工具，然后他们发现了制造这些工具的生物。多尔格瑞姆（Dolgrim）部落从深处崛起。整个殖民地都失去了，并被illithid的腐败所吞噬。当五国进行最后的战争时，Moror陷入了{@i Dol Udar}，即下面的战争，在后面的 \"下面的领域 \"部分有更详细的讨论。",
	"Today, the Mror Holds are in a stalemate against the aberrations below, and remain balanced between the Age of Gold and the War Below. Even with their current holdings, the dwarves continue to draw vast wealth from their mines. Clans take pride in the treasures reclaimed from the depths, and Mror artificers continue to learn from studying ancient artifacts. Though the dwarves are few in number, their economic power and strong fortifications have deterred any Karrnathi retribution, and no one challenged their recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold. The dwarves are proud and prosperous—and yet, old feuds linger. The Realm Below remains both a glorious lure and a deadly threat. And tensions are further exacerbated by the other treasures recovered from the depths—tools made not by dwarves, but by the daelkyr.": "今天，摩尔庄园与下面的异常者处于僵持状态，并在黄金时代和下面的战争之间保持平衡。即使在目前的持有量下，矮人继续从他们的矿场中汲取大量财富。各个部族以从深渊中开垦出的宝藏为荣，Moror的工匠们也继续从研究古代文物中学习。虽然矮人的数量不多，但他们的经济实力和强大的防御工事阻止了任何卡尔纳提的报复，也没有人挑战他们在《王权条约》中的地位。矮人是骄傲的，繁荣的--然而，旧的仇怨仍然存在。下层世界仍然是一个光荣的诱惑和致命的威胁。而从深渊中找到的其他宝物进一步加剧了紧张局势--这些工具不是由矮人制造的，而是由daelkyr制造的。",
	"Dwarves aren't human. In creating a Mror character, it can help to reflect on the ways dwarves differ from humans. Clan plays a significant role in Mror culture; especially in the wake of rediscovering the Realm Below, a Mroranon dwarf is quite different from a Soldorak dwarf. But there are a few common things that can be borne in mind for any Mror character.": "矮人并不是人类。在创造一个Moror角色时，思考一下矮人与人类的不同之处会有所帮助。宗族在Moror文化中起着重要的作用；尤其是在重新发现下层世界之后，Mororanon的矮人与Soldorak的矮人有很大的不同。但对于任何一个摩尔人角色来说，有一些共同的东西可以铭记在心。",
	"While the dwarves of the Realm Below may have spent their entire lives below the surface, the Mror dwarves were born on the surface of the Ironroot Mountains. Mror dwarves appreciate sunlight and color, and their buildings typically have windows, but dwarves don't need light. Absolute darkness impairs their darkvision, but this is merely inconvenient, not unbearable, and many mine tunnels and stretches of the Realm Below have no light sources.": "下界的矮人可能一辈子都在地表下生活，而摩尔矮人则出生在铁根山的地表上。Mror矮人欣赏阳光和色彩，他们的建筑通常有窗户，但矮人不需要光。绝对的黑暗会损害他们的黑暗视觉，但这只是不方便，而不是无法忍受，许多矿井隧道和绵延的下界都没有光源。",
	"Resulting from this, the circadian rhythms of dwarves are more flexible than those of humans. While it's important to maintain a regular schedule, day and night have little meaning for the Mror. Mror communities are active at all hours, and major Mror businesses are continuously open. \"Nightlife\" isn't a concept in Mror society, and entertainment can likewise be found at all hours, so traveling Mror are often frustrated by the limited opportunities in human communities.": "因此，矮人的昼夜节律比人类的更灵活。虽然保持一个有规律的时间表很重要，但白天和黑夜对摩尔人来说没有什么意义。巫师社区在任何时候都很活跃，主要的巫师企业也持续营业。\"夜生活 \"在Moror社会中不是一个概念，娱乐活动也同样可以在任何时间找到，所以旅行中的Moror常常对人类社区中有限的机会感到沮丧。",
	"Characters from the Five Nations are shaped by the Last War, and similarly, Mror are shaped by Dol Udar, the War Below. Currently, this conflict is simmering, but there has been no victory and the threat remains. When the war was at its height, all Mror lived in daily fear of aberrant attacks and society's resources were devoted to the war effort. The Mror Holds are smaller than the Five Nations, and the impact of the conflict was intense. All civilians engaged in combat drills in preparation for dolgrim assault, and everyone was expected to contribute to the war effort—repairing or producing arms and armor, maintaining fortifications, or fighting. For the Mror, this is the source of the Weapon Training and Tool Proficiency racial features. For example, if you are proficient in brewer's tools, you may have been involved in creating supplies for the soldiers.": "五国的角色是由最后的战争塑造的，同样地，Moror也是由Dol Udar，即下面的战争塑造的。目前，这场冲突正在酝酿之中，但还没有取得胜利，威胁依然存在。在战争最激烈的时候，所有的Moror人每天都生活在对反常攻击的恐惧中，社会的资源都被用于战争努力。Mror Holds比五国更小，冲突的影响也很强烈。所有的平民都参与战斗演习，为多尔格林的攻击做准备，每个人都被期望为战争努力做出贡献--修理或生产武器和盔甲，维护防御工事，或战斗。对Moror来说，这就是武器训练和工具熟练度种族特征的来源。例如，如果你精通酿酒工具，你可能参与了为士兵制造物资。",
	"In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider how the war affected you and how this is reflected by your class and proficiencies. A few questions to consider...": "在创建Moror角色或NPC时，考虑战争是如何影响你的，以及这如何反映在你的等级和能力上。有几个问题需要考虑...",
	"Did you fight on the front lines, battling aberrations in the depths? If so, what's the most terrifying thing you saw in the conflict? Are you scarred by your experiences, or does nothing scare you anymore?": "你是否在前线作战，与深处的反常者作战？如果是这样，你在冲突中看到的最可怕的东西是什么？你是否因你的经历而伤痕累累，或者没有什么能让你害怕了？",
	"If you didn't fight in the Realm Below, did you serve on any civilian support brigades? Did you spend your childhood sharpening axes and repairing armor? Were you kept out of the conflict by family connections, or did you refuse to serve?": "如果你没有在下层世界作战，你是否在任何平民支援旅中服务？你的童年是在磨斧头和修理盔甲中度过的吗？你是因家庭关系而被排除在冲突之外，还是拒绝服役？",
	"Who or what did you lose to the conflict? Did you have a stake in a colony or mine that had to be abandoned? Do you have a sibling or lover lost in the depths—and if so, are you sure that they're dead, or could they be prisoners of Dyrrn?": "你在冲突中失去了谁或什么？你是否在一个不得不放弃的殖民地或矿场中拥有利益？你是否有兄弟姐妹或爱人在深海中失踪--如果有，你确定他们已经死了，或者他们可能是Dyrrn的囚犯？",
	"Do you dream of delving deeper into the depths, or would you rather see the Realm Below sealed away forever?": "你是梦想深入研究深渊，还是愿意看到下层世界永远被封存？",
	"The Mror Holds are a feudal society, comprised of holds, spires, and families. There are twelve active holds, each governed by a ruling clan, which gives its name to the hold—so Droranathhold is ruled by Clan Droranath. Each hold is then broken up into smaller territories known as spires, each ruled by a clan; there are ancient ties of kinship and marriage between clans and the ruling clan. Within a spire, families maintain tenant relationships with the local clan. Land is held by a clan or family, and most businesses are family businesses. Families are long established, and the creation of a new family is an extremely rare event.": "摩尔庄园是一个封建社会，由庄园、塔楼和家族组成。共有12个活跃的封地，每个封地由一个统治部族管理，该部族为封地命名--因此德洛拉那斯封地由德洛拉那斯部族统治。每个封地又被分割成更小的领土，称为尖塔，每个尖塔由一个部族统治；部族和统治部族之间存在着古老的亲属关系和婚姻关系。在一个尖塔内，家庭与当地部族保持着租户关系。土地由一个部族或家族持有，大多数企业是家族企业。家庭是长期建立的，建立一个新的家庭是极其罕见的事情。",
	"The Mror engage with their history through stories, and clans and families are the characters in those stories. Typically, a Mror tale refers to heroes and villains solely by their family names. So in {@i Mroranon and the Troll King}, it doesn't matter exactly when the story took place or which specific Mroranon it was; it's a story about {@i Mroranon}. In one tale, he is a heroic youth, and in another, she is a battle-scarred veteran, and yet they're depicted as the same Mroranon. And in both cases, all Mroranon dwarves should strive to live up to that example. Where the Tairnadal elves seek to emulate specific ancestors, Mror dwarves view their family as a greater whole. Your family is a direct extension of your identity; it's only natural that you'd help a family member in need, and betraying a family member is like stabbing yourself in the hand. This drives feuds and alliances; if you're wronged by a Hronnath dwarf, the blame lies with Clan Hronnath, not simply the individual. To draw another comparison to the elves, the Aereni preserve their ancestors as deathless undead. In contrast, the Mror don't feel that need to preserve individuals; you preserve your family by living up to its character and by adding to its story. The Mror also aren't as particular about precisely following the traditions of ancestors, as shown by the clans that are embracing symbionts; what you do is less important than how you do it, the values you stand for, and the lines you refuse to cross.": "摩尔人通过故事来了解他们的历史，而部族和家庭就是这些故事中的人物。通常情况下，Moror故事中的英雄和恶棍只用他们的姓氏来指代。因此，在（%0%）中，故事究竟发生在什么时候，或者是哪一个具体的Mororanon并不重要；它是一个关于（%1%）的故事。在一个故事中，他是一个英雄般的青年，而在另一个故事中，她是一个饱经战火的老兵，但他们却被描绘成同一个Mororanon。而在这两种情况下，所有的Mororanon矮人都应该努力践行这一榜样。在泰尔纳达尔精灵寻求效仿特定祖先的地方，莫罗尔矮人将他们的家庭视为一个更大的整体。你的家庭是你身份的直接延伸；你会帮助有需要的家庭成员是很自然的，而背叛一个家庭成员就像在自己手上捅了一刀。这推动了仇视和联盟；如果你被一个赫罗纳斯矮人冤枉，责任在于赫罗纳斯氏族，而不仅仅是个人。为了和精灵做另一个比较，艾瑞尼人把他们的祖先作为不死的亡灵保存起来。相比之下，Moror人并不觉得有必要保留个人；你通过活出自己的性格和增加自己的故事来保护你的家族。姆罗尔人也不像其他人那样讲究精确地遵循祖先的传统，正如那些接受共生体的部族所显示的那样；你做什么并不重要，重要的是你如何做，你所代表的价值观，以及你拒绝跨越的界限。",
	"This doesn't mean that Mror don't take personal responsibility for their actions or feel pride in their personal deeds. The deeds of living dwarves are generally acknowledged by name, but when they take their place in history, their names are unlikely to be remembered. Instead, every dwarf hopes that their grand deeds will be added to the trove of stories told of their family—and that they won't shame their family with the memories of their misdeeds.": "这并不意味着Moror不为自己的行为负责，也不为自己的个人事迹感到骄傲。活着的矮人的事迹一般都被点名承认，但当他们在历史上占有一席之地时，他们的名字不太可能被人记住。相反，每个矮人都希望他们的宏伟事迹能被添加到关于他们家族的故事库中--而且他们不会因为回忆自己的错误行为而使家族蒙羞。",
	"In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider your family. Are you part of a clan or ruling clan? If so, are you close enough to power to take the noble background, or are you a lesser heir? Are you from a tenant family, and if so, what is your family's business? Even more crucial, what is your family's {@i character}? When people tell stories about your family, what are the virtues they highlight? Are there any particular things your family is known for, any celebrated deeds you might emulate, or anything a member of your family should never do? Some families have specific taboos; a Tronnan must never break their word, while a Holladon never turns away a guest. Does your family have any such traditions?": "在创建一个Moror角色或NPC时，要考虑你的家庭。你是一个部族或统治部族的一员吗？如果是的话，你是否足够接近权力而采取贵族的背景，或者你是一个较小的继承人？你是否来自佃户家庭，如果是的话，你的家庭是做什么的？更为关键的是，你的家族的（%0%）是什么？当人们讲述关于你的家庭的故事时，他们强调的优点是什么？有什么特别的事情是你的家庭所熟知的，有什么值得你效仿的著名事迹，或者有什么是你的家庭成员不应该做的？有些家庭有特定的禁忌；Tronnan人决不能食言，而Holladon人决不能拒绝客人。你的家族有这样的传统吗？",
	"Also consider how your family was affected by the Dol Udar. Did they invest deeply in the depths, only to suffer grievous losses when the horrors rose? Did they fight on the front lines, or largely remain above? Do they have a family treasure recovered from the Realm Below—a legendary item or artifact you might someday have the honor to wield? Are they willing to embrace symbionts, or are they disgusted by the tools of the daelkyr?": "还要考虑你的家庭是如何受到多尔-乌达的影响的。他们是否在深处投资，只是在恐怖上升时遭受了严重的损失？他们是在前线战斗，还是基本上留在上面？他们是否有从下层世界找回的家族宝物--一个传说中的物品或神器，你有朝一日可能有幸挥舞它？他们是愿意接受共生体，还是对daelkyr的工具感到厌恶？",
	"Finally, what is your standing with your family? If it's good, consider why you left the Mror Holds; chapter 1 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} includes a table with suggestions for this. If your standing is bad, what happened? Is it a situation you hope to fix, or have you turned your back on your family? As a player, talk to your DM about the role your family might play in a campaign; do you want to have cousins showing up in need of assistance or to be drawn into new feuds, or would you rather your family remain in your backstory?": "最后，你在家庭中的地位如何？如果是好的，考虑一下你为什么离开Mror Holds；{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}的第一章包括一个表格，其中有这方面的建议。如果你的地位不好，发生了什么？这是你希望解决的情况，还是你已经背弃了你的家人？作为玩家，请与你的DM讨论你的家人在战役中可能扮演的角色；你想让表兄弟出现在需要帮助的地方或被卷入新的争斗中，还是你希望你的家人留在你的背景故事中？",
	"The Mror attitude toward family is one example of how they deal with their long lives. A dwarf can live to be up to 350 years old; intellectually, they mature at about the same rate as humans, but they generally aren't considered to be full adults until around 50 years of age. This ties to the fact that dwarves have a low fertility rate and their reproductive peak is between 50 and 120. While under 50, a Mror dwarf is usually learning the family trade and working directly for their parents, uncles, or aunts; at 50 and above, a dwarf starts thinking about starting their own branch of the family tree and the family trade.": "Mror对家庭的态度是他们如何处理其长寿的一个例子。一个矮人可以活到350岁；在智力上，他们的成熟速度与人类差不多，但他们一般在50岁左右才被认为是完全成年。这与矮人的生育率低有关，他们的生育高峰在50至120岁之间。在50岁以下时，Moror矮人通常在学习家族贸易，并直接为他们的父母、叔叔或阿姨工作；50岁以上时，矮人开始考虑开始自己的家谱分支和家族贸易。",
	"In stark contrast to the elves of Aerenal, the Mror dwarves deal with their long lives by largely ignoring the passage of time: they intentionally don't record every detail or remember every person, instead simply holding on to the best moments and ideas. To them, the story matters more than the concrete facts. Individuals come and go, but the family remains, and the story continues. And the Mror deeply love stories. Like the dar, they prefer stories to be based on fact as opposed to being absolute fiction—but to the Mror, a story should always be entertaining, and as long as the spirit is true, it's fine to exaggerate the details. So while the talespinner bard serves as a keeper of history, their role as entertainers is as important—if not more so—than their role as sage.": "与艾瑞纳的精灵们形成鲜明对比的是，摩尔矮人在处理他们漫长的生命时，在很大程度上忽略了时间的流逝：他们有意不记录每一个细节或记住每一个人，而只是保留着最美好的时刻和想法。对他们来说，故事比具体事实更重要。个人来了又走，但家庭还在，故事还在继续。而且Moror人深爱着故事。像达尔人一样，他们更喜欢以事实为基础的故事，而不是绝对的虚构，但对先生们来说，一个故事应该永远是娱乐性的，只要精神是真实的，夸大细节也是可以的。因此，虽然讲故事的吟游诗人是历史的守护者，但他们作为娱乐者的角色与他们作为圣人的角色同样重要，甚至更重要。",
	"Mror dwarves can be seen as boastful by outsiders, quick to share tales of their exploits. However, they don't seek to dominate every conversation with their tales, but expect others to share their stories as well—and if others don't, Mror are quick to boast about the deeds of their companions. Anyone who spends much time around Mror quickly grows used to the phrase {@i Tol kollan}—or the Common translation, \"That reminds me of a story.\" Mror hate quick meetings; any gathering should have time for tales. In playing a Mror character, you might come up with a few stories you love, as well as taking joy in dramatically retelling the story of your adventures—the deeds of both you and your fellow adventurers—celebrating and highlighting your finest moments.": "在外人看来，Moror矮人是夸夸其谈的，很快就会分享他们的事迹。然而，他们并不寻求用他们的故事来主导每一次谈话，而是希望其他人也能分享他们的故事，如果其他人不这样做，Moror会很快夸耀他们同伴的事迹。任何在Moror身边呆久了的人都会很快习惯这句话（%0%）--或者普通的翻译：\"这让我想起了一个故事。\" 巫师讨厌快速的会议；任何聚会都应该有时间讲故事。在扮演一个Moror角色时，你可能会想出一些你喜欢的故事，以及在戏剧性地复述你的冒险故事时感到高兴--你和你的同伴的事迹--庆祝和强调你最美好的时刻。",
	"Most Mror businesses are family businesses passed down over generations. However, families can and do adapt to deal with changing circumstances. In particular, the arrival of the dragonmarked houses forced many families to change their paths or to find a way to work with the houses. The Jolnar family of Toldrathhold had been healers for generations, but they couldn't match the healing capabilities of House Jorasco. Over time, the Jolnar shifted their focus to cultivating medicinal herbs and other supplies needed by Jorasco. They are still devoted to the health of others, but they've found a way to work with Jorasco instead of directly challenging it.": "大多数Moror企业是世代相传的家族企业。然而，家族可以而且确实在适应变化的环境。特别是，龙纹屋的到来迫使许多家庭改变了他们的道路，或者找到一种与龙纹屋合作的方式。Trathhold的Jolnar家族世代都是治疗师，但他们无法与Jorasco家族的治疗能力相比。随着时间的推移，乔尔纳家族将他们的重点转移到种植药材和乔拉斯科需要的其他用品上。他们仍然致力于他人的健康，但他们已经找到了一种与乔拉斯科合作的方式，而不是直接挑战它。",
	"In short, Mror families are more flexible than the Tairnadal or Aereni. They are willing to change their specific traditions or techniques to adapt to changing times; what matters is remaining true to the core values of the family.": "简而言之，Moror家族比Tairnadal或Aereni更灵活。他们愿意改变自己的具体传统或技术，以适应不断变化的时代；重要的是保持对家庭核心价值的忠诚。",
	"The Mror are known for their love of objects—their love of {@i treasure}. In part, this ties to a deep appreciation of quality work. The dwarves appreciate beautiful things, but durability and functionality are far more important—as shown by the willingness of many dwarves to embrace grotesque symbionts. However, the dwarves are not greedy hoarders; while there are certain families known for their thrift, generosity is an important virtue to the Mror. As much as they value their treasures, there's joy in giving the perfect gift—showing that you can afford to give away a treasure, and that you recognize someone who will appreciate it and make good use of it. A common tradition at a grand feast is for each of the greatest heroes present—typically, the scions of ruling clans—to offer a gift to the host along with a tale of how they came by the gift; the one who gives the finest gift is served first at the feast.": "莫洛尔人以其对物品的热爱而闻名，他们对{@i treasure}的热爱。在某种程度上，这与对高质量工作的深刻欣赏有关。矮人欣赏美丽的东西，但耐用性和功能性要重要得多--许多矮人愿意接受怪诞的共生体就说明了这一点。然而，矮人并不是贪婪的囤积者；虽然有一些家庭以节俭著称，但慷慨大方对摩尔人来说是一种重要的美德。尽管他们非常珍视自己的财宝，但送出完美的礼物也是一种乐趣--表明你有能力送出财宝，而且你认识到有人会欣赏它并善加利用它。在盛大的宴会上，一个常见的传统是，每个在场的最伟大的英雄--通常是统治家族的子孙--都要向主人献上一份礼物，并讲述他们如何得到这份礼物的故事；献出最好礼物的人在宴会上第一个上菜。",
	"While you may not have many feasts, consider this tradition when you have time and opportunity. Is there a chance to give a comrade a perfect gift? Is there a treasure you possess that might be better suited to one of your companions?": "虽然你可能没有很多宴席，但当你有时间和机会时，考虑这个传统。是否有机会给一个同伴一个完美的礼物？是否有你拥有的宝物可能更适合于你的某个同伴？",
	"The Mror are deeply interested in objects with stories of their own. Every family has their own family treasures. Sometimes these are the most powerful magic items the dwarves have acquired, notably the case with artifacts and legendary items that have been recovered from the Realm Below over the last century; part of the pride of the ruling clans is derived from the treasures they can boast of. But a family treasure can also be a mundane item that has been a part of many epic stories. As noted earlier, no one cares which specific Mroranon heir was the hero of {@i Mroranon and the Troll King}. But if the house still has the bracer that hero made from the troll king's nose ring, carrying this relic is a tremendous source of pride. As a Mror adventurer, when you find treasures, you want to know the stories they already carrying—who forged this flame tongue shortsword and what battles has it seen? Also consider the items you possess that you feel a strong attachment to—how are their stories evolving along with yours?": "Mror对有自己故事的物品深感兴趣。每个家族都有自己的家族宝藏。有时，这些是矮人获得的最强大的魔法物品，尤其是在过去一个世纪里从地下世界找到的神器和传奇物品；统治家族的部分自豪感来自于他们可以夸耀的宝物。但是，家族宝藏也可以是一个平凡的物品，它曾是许多史诗故事的一部分。如前所述，没有人关心哪个具体的Mororanon继承人是（%0%）的英雄。但如果房子里还有英雄用巨魔王的鼻环做的手镯，带着这个遗物就是巨大的骄傲了。作为一个Moror冒险家，当你发现宝物时，你想知道它们已经承载的故事--谁锻造了这把火焰舌短剑，它经历了哪些战斗？也要考虑你所拥有的那些让你感到强烈依恋的物品，它们的故事是如何与你的故事一起发展的？",
	"Clothes tell a story, and Mror dwarves love to tell tales with them—of clan and family, faith, and personality. As with most Mror possessions, the quality of clothing comes first. Because of this, dwarves from lesser families may only have a single set of clothing, but these are durable and well made. Though their basic outfits may be few, Mror place great stock in accessories, and a Mror outfit typically has elements that can be reversed, shifted, or removed. Brooches have important cultural significance, and can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, the symbol of a Sovereign whose favor is sought, or even moods; some brooches mean \"leave me alone\" or \"looking for company.\" Other forms of jewelry—rings, chains, bracelets—are commonly worn by dwarves of both genders; this is an opportunity to show wealth, but decorative ornaments of iron are also worn by common folk. The {@i dultar}—blood blade—is a dagger worn both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance; each of the ruling clans has a distinct style of dultar. Any Mror dwarf can immediately identify another dwarf's clan from their dultar; for an outsider to recognize one, it requires a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill History}) check.": "衣服会讲故事，而摩尔矮人喜欢用衣服讲故事，包括家族和家庭、信仰和个性。与大多数Moror的财产一样，衣服的质量是第一位的。因此，来自小家庭的矮人可能只有一套衣服，但这些衣服都很耐用，而且做工精细。虽然他们的基本服装可能不多，但摩尔人非常重视配件，而且摩尔人的服装通常都有可以反转、转移或移除的元素。胸针具有重要的文化意义，可以描绘出家族的徽章、统治部族的印章、被寻求的君主的象征，甚至是心情；有些胸针意味着 \"让我一个人呆着 \"或 \"寻找同伴\"。其他形式的珠宝--戒指、链子、手镯--通常由男女矮人佩戴；这是一个展示财富的机会，但普通人也会佩戴铁制的装饰品。{@i dultar}--血刃--是一把匕首，既是一种实用工具，也是一种效忠的声明；每个统治部族都有一种独特的dultar风格。任何一个Moror矮人都可以从他们的dultar上立即识别出另一个矮人的部族；对于一个外人来说，要识别一个dultar，需要成功地进行{@dc 13}智力({@skill History})检查。",
	"Many Mror clans favor a martial aspect to their attire, especially in the wake of Dol Udar. However, not everyone wants to wear heavy steel all day, and the Mror generally use light alloys and thin layers of metal to craft their armor. Many Mror wear decorative armor that uses the statistics of light armor, but evokes the general flavor of a heavier breastplate—though anyone proficient in medium or heavy armor immediately recognizes the decorative nature of it.": "许多Moror氏族喜欢在服饰上体现出武术的一面，尤其是在Dol Udar之后。然而，并不是每个人都愿意整天穿着厚重的钢铁，Moror通常使用轻型合金和薄层金属来制作他们的盔甲。许多Moror穿着装饰性的盔甲，使用轻型盔甲的统计数据，但唤起了更重的胸甲的一般味道--尽管任何精通中型或重型盔甲的人都能立即认识到它的装饰性本质。",
	"Facial hair is common among the Mror, but styles vary by clan and family. Some families prefer neatly trimmed beards. Many clans weave beads into beards, with the design of the bead invoking the favor of a Sovereign or honoring a clan. Hair dye is often used as a form of personal expression.": "脸部毛发在姆罗尔人中很常见，但风格因部族和家庭而异。有些家族喜欢修剪整齐的胡须。许多部族将珠子编织在胡须上，珠子的设计能唤起君主的青睐或对某个部族的尊敬。染发剂经常被用来作为个人表达的一种形式。",
	"Clans that have embraced the use of symbionts—notably Soldorak, Toranath, and Narathun—have developed many exotic fashions over the last century. For such dwarves, wearing symbiont clothing or accessories is a sign of courage and power, much as a hunter might wear the hides of animals they've defeated. Living clothing typically has a texture similar to leather, though chitin plating or hornlike protrusions are possible. Patterns or colors may shift to reflect the mood of the wearer, and a living cloak may ripple or billow of its own accord. Living clothing is self-cleaning and mending, and feeds on the excretions (primarily sweat) of the host. Narathun currently has the finest artisan-breeders working with living clothing, and styles are constantly evolving": "接受使用共生体的部族--特别是索多拉克、托拉纳特和纳拉逊--在过去一个世纪里开发了许多奇特的时尚。对于这些矮人来说，穿着共生体的衣服或配饰是勇气和力量的象征，就像一个猎人可能穿着他们打败的动物的皮一样。活体服装的质地通常与皮革相似，但甲壳素镀层或角状突起也有可能。图案或颜色可能会改变，以反映穿戴者的情绪，而活体斗篷可能会自行产生波纹或波浪。活生生的衣服可以自我清洁和修补，并以主人的排泄物（主要是汗水）为食。纳拉逊目前有最好的工匠培育者在从事活体衣的工作，而且样式也在不断发展。",
	"Mror dwarves have exceptional constitutions and are resistant to poison, and thanks to these traits, they enjoy cuisine that others might avoid. The dwarves live in high mountains and subterranean settlements; while some of their meats and vegetables are familiar to the people of the Five Nations, they also use a wide variety of mushrooms and moss. Red pudding is a form of peaceful ooze raised as livestock and used in a variety of dishes. Mror stew can sicken creatures with more delicate stomachs, but it's entirely harmless to any creature resistant to poison damage, and many stout halflings of the Talenta Plains enjoy Mror cuisine.": "Mror矮人有特殊的体质，对毒药有抵抗力，由于这些特征，他们喜欢吃别人可能会避免的美食。矮人生活在高山和地下定居点；虽然他们的一些肉类和蔬菜是五国人民所熟悉的，但他们也使用各种各样的蘑菇和苔藓。红色布丁是一种作为牲畜饲养的和平渗出物，用于各种菜肴。姆罗尔炖肉会让胃部更脆弱的生物感到不适，但对任何抗毒害的生物来说完全无害，塔伦塔平原的许多粗壮的半身人喜欢姆罗尔美食。",
	"Alcohol is also a form of poison, and Mror spirits have to be exceptionally strong for sturdy dwarves to enjoy their mindaltering properties. Mror brewers often use mushrooms to produce alcohol, and also produce mushroom-based beverages with light hallucinogenic effects. The drinks of the Five Nations are extremely weak by Mror standards, and some consider the ability to brew personal supplies to be a basic survival tool when traveling in foreign lands. And when outsiders visit the Mror, their hosts are careful to keep these travelers from buying drinks that could kill them.": "酒精也是一种毒药，摩尔人的酒必须特别烈，才能让结实的矮人享受其改变心智的特性。摩尔人的酿酒师经常使用蘑菇来生产酒精，还生产具有轻度致幻作用的蘑菇饮料。按照Moror的标准，五国的饮料是极其微弱的，有些人认为在异国他乡旅行时，酿造个人用品的能力是一种基本的生存工具。而当外来者访问Moror时，他们的主人会小心翼翼地防止这些旅行者购买可能杀死他们的饮料。",
	"Mror talespinners maintain that the dwarves are the original chosen people of the Sovereigns, especially Kol Korran and Onatar. It's a curious coincidence that {@i kol} is the Dwarvish word for \"commerce,\" while {@i dol} means \"war,\" and the talespinners say the Traveler stole the names of the Sovereigns from the dwarves during the Exile. The priests of Krona Peak say that Kol Korran came to the hero Mroranon and promised the dwarves wealth if they remembered his name and followed his path, while the talespinners of Doldarunhold swear that the hero Doldarun was the son of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah. The records of the Library of Korranberg show that Zil missionaries were active in the Ironroots in the centuries before Bal Dulor, and some sages assert that these tales may have been the work of clever missionaries. Whatever the truth, the Mror already had shrines to the Sovereigns when young Karrn led his forces to conquer the holds.": "Mror讲故事的人坚持认为，矮人是君主最初的选民，特别是科尔科尔兰和奥纳塔。一个奇怪的巧合是，{@i kol}是矮人的 \"商业 \"一词，而{@i dol}是 \"战争 \"的意思，故事家们说旅行者在流放期间从矮人那里偷走了主权者的名字。克罗纳峰的祭司们说，科尔-科兰来到英雄莫洛兰身边，并承诺如果矮人记住他的名字并追随他的道路，他们就能获得财富，而多尔达伦霍德的传说家们则发誓，英雄多尔达伦是多尔多恩和多尔阿拉的儿子。科兰贝格图书馆的记录显示，在巴尔-杜勒之前的几个世纪里，齐尔传教士活跃在铁矿区，一些圣人断言，这些故事可能是聪明的传教士所为。无论真相如何，当年轻的卡恩率领他的军队征服该地时，Moror已经有了供奉主权者的神龛。",
	"While the Mror broadly acknowledge all of the Sovereigns, Kol Korran and Onatar are the most beloved; Boldrei and Olladra are also often invoked. Clan Doldarun, Mroranon, and Soranath are especially devout, while Droranath, Soldorak, and Toldorath are the most pragmatic. The Blood of Vol and the Dark Six have small followings in Narathun.": "虽然Moror人广泛承认所有的君主，但Kol Korran和Onatar是最受喜爱的；Boldrei和Olladra也经常被援引。多尔达伦（Doldarun）家族、莫拉农（Mororanon）和索拉纳特（Soranath）特别虔诚，而德罗纳特（Droranath）、索多拉克（Soldorak）和托尔多拉斯（Toldorath）则最务实。沃尔之血和黑暗六人组在纳拉逊有少量的追随者。",
	"While humanity largely ignored the Mror until after the foundation of Galifar, Zil explorers came to the mountains well before Bal Dulor. The characters of the Zil and Mror complement each other; the Zil are fascinated with abstract knowledge and love keeping records and accounting, while the Mror prefer story and emotion to dull fact. Resultingly, Zil scribes quickly became a standard feature in clan courts.": "虽然人类在很大程度上忽视了Moror，直到Galifar建立之后，Zil探险家早在Bal Dulor之前就来到了山区。齐尔人和莫洛人的性格相辅相成；齐尔人对抽象的知识着迷，喜欢记录和核算，而莫洛人则喜欢故事和情感，而不是枯燥的事实。因此，齐尔文士很快就成了氏族法庭的一个标准特征。",
	"As the Mror embraced banking and international business, this partnership grew. The Mror Holds and Zilargo are strong allies, and the alliance between House Kundarak and House Sivis is the strongest of the Twelve.": "随着Moror家族拥抱银行业和国际商业，这种伙伴关系也在不断发展。Mror Holds和Zilargo是强大的盟友，而Kundarak家族和Sivis家族的联盟是12个家族中最强大的。",
	"Each clan holds dominion over a spire, with the ruling clans laying claim to all remaining land within a hold. Critically, a clan holds domain both over its territory and all that lies below it. Early in the tenth century, miners in multiple holds broke through to the Realm Below. Wide tunnels shaped by elemental magic led to grand halls and subterranean cities crafted with techniques far beyond those of the modern Mror earthmovers. Avenues were lit by {@spell continual flame}, and environmental enchantments ensured purity of air and comfortable climate. One might think the dwarves would have been more curious about the fate of the builders, but the ancient halls were entirely empty, with no signs of blood or bone. To those who discovered them, these empty halls were not foreboding, but a gift from the Sovereigns—a wondrous realm waiting for residents.": "每个部族对一个尖顶拥有统治权，统治部族对一个地区的所有剩余土地提出要求。最重要的是，一个部族对其领土和其下面的所有土地都拥有统治权。十世纪初，多个矿区的矿工突破重围，进入地下世界。由元素魔法塑造的宽阔隧道通向宏伟的大厅和地下城市，其技术远远超过了现代的Moror挖土机。大道由（%0%）照明，环境魔法确保了空气的纯净和舒适的气候。人们可能会认为矮人会对建造者的命运更加好奇，但这些古老的大厅完全是空的，没有血迹或骨头的痕迹。对那些发现它们的人来说，这些空荡荡的大厅不是预兆，而是来自君主的礼物--一个等待居民的奇妙境界。",
	"Clan leaders proceeded with caution, but were lured in as greater wonders were discovered. Ancient forges held the promise of forgotten techniques that could yet be reclaimed. Explorers returned with ornaments of gold and silver, found simply lying around the avenues for the taking. And there were mines—mines far safer and grander than those above, yet still containing riches. In time, explorers would realize that some of the richest mines were not entirely natural—that some shafts connect to demiplanes where the rules of reality don't always apply, like mines where emeralds grow like moss. This, too, could have been a warning, but the clan rulers were dazzled by wonder and opportunity. Expeditions moved into these upper levels, establishing colonies in the Realm Below. Miners began working the ancient veins, and smiths brought some of the forgotten foundries back online.": "族长们小心翼翼地前进，但随着更大的奇迹被发现，他们被吸引了过来。古老的锻造厂蕴含着被遗忘的技术的希望，这些技术还可以被重新获得。探险家们带着金银饰物回来，这些饰物被发现时就躺在通道周围供人取用。还有一些矿井--比上面那些更安全、更宏伟的矿井，但仍然蕴藏着丰富的财富。随着时间的推移，探险家们会意识到，一些最富有的矿井并不完全是自然形成的--有些矿井连接到现实规则并不总是适用的半位面，比如绿宝石像苔藓一样生长的矿井。这也可能是一个警告，但氏族统治者被奇迹和机会所迷惑。探险队进入这些上层，在下层世界建立殖民地。矿工们开始开采古老的矿脉，铁匠们将一些被遗忘的铸造厂重新投入使用。",
	"For a time, it seemed like a golden age. No one knows exactly what brought it to an end. It may be the fault of adventurers and explorers who pressed too deep, ever searching for greater treasures. Or it could be that Dyrrn and its minions were watching the Mror expansion all along, waiting for the civilian population in the subterranean colonies to reach a critical level. At first, scouts brought back reports of newly exposed tunnels and chambers, of passages coated with unnatural fluids and strange things growing among mushroom gardens. Then the scouts stopped returning and the first wave of attacks began. Squads of dolgrims. Chokers lurking in the shadows. Soldorakhold faced howling mobs of derro—possibly the twisted survivors of Noldrunhold, the Lost Clan (described later in this chapter). Strange plagues and implacable oozes spread through the sunken colonies of Londurak. It was a time of terror, but also determination: whatever this unknown threat was, it must be held in the depths at any cost.": "有一段时间，这似乎是一个黄金时代。没有人知道到底是什么导致了它的结束。这可能是冒险家和探险家的错，他们压得太深，不断寻找更大的宝藏。也可能是Dyrrn和它的爪牙一直在观察Moror的扩张，等待地下殖民地的平民人口达到一个关键水平。起初，侦察员带回了关于新暴露的隧道和房间的报告，以及涂有非自然液体的通道和蘑菇园中生长的奇怪东西。然后，侦察员不再返回，第一波攻击开始了。一队队的多林人。潜伏在阴影中的扼杀者。索多拉克霍德面对着嚎叫的德鲁人--可能是诺德伦霍德的扭曲幸存者，失落的家族（在本章后面描述）。陌生的瘟疫和无情的渗出物在朗杜拉克的沉没殖民地中蔓延。那是一个恐怖的时代，但也是一个决心：无论这种未知的威胁是什么，都必须不惜一切代价将其控制在深处。",
	"Armies were rallied, clans sending their finest soldiers into the depths, while every citizen trained with axe and hammer in preparation for dolgrim raids or a more dramatic surface assault. While some clans considered withdrawal, pride and a hunger for the wealth and wonders still hidden kept the dwarves fighting. They believed if they didn't hold them below, the aberrations would merely follow them to the surface. The years that followed were a time of endless terror and uncertainty. As the horrors were driven back in one hold, they would strike with redoubled force in another. New threats appeared with alarming regularity; dolgrims and derro were common foes, but there was no telling when a previously unknown danger would rise.": "军队被召集起来，各部族将他们最优秀的士兵送入深渊，而每个公民都在用斧头和锤子进行训练，准备迎接多尔格林姆的袭击或更引人注目的地面攻击。虽然有些部族考虑撤军，但自豪感和对仍然隐藏着的财富和奇迹的渴望使矮人不断战斗。他们相信，如果他们不把他们关在下面，反常者只会跟着他们到地面上。随后的几年是一个无尽的恐怖和不确定性的时期。当恐怖在一个地方被击退时，它们会在另一个地方以加倍的力量袭击。新的威胁以惊人的频率出现；多勒姆和德罗是常见的敌人，但不知道什么时候会出现一个以前未知的危险。",
	"Two major discoveries shaped the second decade of the war. The first was the revelation of the enemy the Mror faced: the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. In 943 YK, the illithid Dyrrashar seized the colony below Loran's Gate in Soldorakhold, and broadcast a psychic message known as Dyrrn's Promise. This telepathic message didn't take the form of words, and attempts to transcribe it have produced widely varied translations. But the thrust was this: \"You have drawn the gaze of the Overmind. You walk the Foul Labyrinth. Everything will change.\" Clan Soldorak eventually retook Loran's Gate and forced Dyrrashar to retreat, but the illithid general has risen elsewhere and remains at large today. None who experienced Dyrrn's Promise can ever forget it.": "两个重大发现决定了战争的第二个十年。第一个发现是揭示了摩尔人所面临的敌人：被称为 \"腐蚀者迪尔恩 \"的戴尔克尔。在公元943年，幻术师迪尔拉夏尔夺取了索多拉克霍德的洛兰之门下的殖民地，并广播了一条被称为 \"迪尔恩的承诺 \"的心灵感应信息。这条心灵感应的信息并没有采取文字的形式，而且试图转录它所产生的译文也大相径庭。但其主旨是这样的。\"你已经吸引了超能力者的目光。你走在肮脏的迷宫里。一切都会改变。\" 索尔多拉克家族最终夺回了洛兰之门，并迫使迪尔拉萨撤退，但这位伊里希德将军已在其他地方崛起，至今仍逍遥法外。经历过迪尔恩之约的人都无法忘记它。",
	"Even as Dyrrn's Promise spread fear, a second discovery brought hope. Following grave losses, Clan Londurak withdrew its forces to the surface. The Londurak prepared their defenses for a surface attack... but it never came. This pattern was repeated in other spires and holds; though the reasons are unclear, Dyrrn's forces won't pursue their enemies beyond Sol Udar.": "就在Dyrrn的承诺传播恐惧的同时，第二个发现带来了希望。在遭受严重损失后，朗杜拉克部族将其部队撤回到地面。朗杜拉克人准备好了他们的防御措施，准备迎接地面的攻击......但它从未到来。这种模式在其他尖塔和堡垒中重复出现；虽然原因不明，但迪尔恩的军队不会在索尔乌达之外追击他们的敌人。",
	"Nobody's sure why the aberrations avoid attacking the surface in force. Sages theorize it's tied to the wards that bind Dyrrn within its demiplane, and the aberrations only venture so far from the realm of their master. Or perhaps it's just a tactical choice. Regardless of the reason, the war has been in a stalemate over the last few years. But many sages believe that complacency is foolish, and until they know with absolute certainty what keeps Dyrrn's forces from rising to the surface, they can't know their protection will last. And even if the dolgrim hordes won't leave the tunnels and there's no threat of a large-scale assault, the Slithering Lord could be unfolding more subtle schemes.": "没人知道为什么反常者会避免大举进攻地面。贤者们推测，这与将迪尔恩束缚在其半位面内的防护装置有关，而反常者只在其主人的领域内冒险。或者，这只是一个战术选择。不管是什么原因，在过去的几年里，战争一直处于僵持状态。但许多圣人认为，自满是愚蠢的，在他们绝对确定地知道是什么让多尔恩的部队不上升到地面之前，他们无法知道他们的保护会持续下去。而且，即使多尔恩大军不会离开隧道，也没有大规模攻击的威胁，滑翔翼之王可能正在展开更微妙的计划。",
	"Londurakhold and Tordannonhold have both pulled back from the war, fortifying all passages to the Realm Below and forbidding any traffic with the depths; they ignore the Realm Below, believing that if they don't poke the stirge's nest, the aberrations won't threaten them. Most of the other major clans maintain lines in the depths, defending claimed mines and colonies with steel and blood. These territories are secured by heavy fortifications, strong enough to repel attack, though serving on the line is a dangerous job. But the dwarves aren't trying to press beyond their current lines, for if they venture across it, their fate is unknown.": "Londurakhold和Tordannonhold都从战争中撤退了，他们加固了所有通往下层世界的通道，并禁止任何与深渊的交通；他们无视下层世界，认为如果他们不捅破搅屎棍的老巢，畸形人就不会威胁到他们。大多数其他主要部族都在深海中保持着防线，用钢铁和鲜血保卫他们所声称的矿场和殖民地。这些领土由重型防御工事保障，足以击退攻击，尽管在防线上服务是一项危险的工作。但矮人并不试图超越他们目前的防线，因为如果他们冒险越过防线，他们的命运是未知的。",
	"The future of the war remains unclear. Many of the clan lords yearn to press deeper. But there have been all too many casualties over the past few decades, and there is still considerable fear that the current lull is a trick—that Dyrrn is building forces for a renewed assault. And no one knows if there is a way to win the war once and for all, or if it's just a matter of advancing the line another hundred feet. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide whether the war remains as a lurking threat, or if it heats up and dominates the story.": "战争的前景仍然不明朗。许多部族的领主都渴望深入推进。但在过去的几十年里，已经有太多的伤亡，而且人们仍然相当担心目前的平静是一个骗局--Dyrrn正在建立部队，准备再次发动攻击。没有人知道是否有办法一劳永逸地赢得战争，或者只是将战线再向前推进100英尺的问题。最终，战争是作为一种潜伏的威胁，还是升温并主导故事的发展，将由DM来决定。",
	"While the aberrations have yet to come to the surface in force, the war is ongoing, and it can be felt on the surface. Individual aberrations occasionally come to the surface; a lone choker might carry out a spree of killings, or an illithid could rise to work with a dwarf cult. Psychic attacks, unnatural diseases, and other threats can emanate from the depths.": "虽然反常者还没有大规模地出现在地表，但战争仍在进行，而且在地表可以感受到。个别反常者偶尔会浮出水面；一个孤独的窒息者可能会进行疯狂的杀戮，或者一个伊利希德人可能会崛起与一个矮人邪教合作。精神攻击、非自然疾病和其他威胁会从深处发出来。",
	"In the past three decades, the touch of Dyrrn has become seen even in the children born to the Mror dwarves. Very rarely, an infant born to ordinary parents is different. Known as ruinbound dwarves, these unusual infants are born with a personal symbiont bound to them, along with other unnerving mutations—and unexpected powers. Chapter 6 contains more information about ruinbound dwarves (and their reception amongst the Mror), along with a playable subrace.": "在过去的三十年里，即使在莫尔矮人所生的孩子身上，也能看到迪尔恩的触觉。极少数情况下，普通父母所生的婴儿会有所不同。这些不寻常的婴儿被称为 \"废墟中的矮人\"，他们出生时就被绑定了一个个人共生体，还有其他令人不安的变异和意想不到的力量。第6章包含了更多关于废墟矮人的信息（以及他们在摩尔人中的地位），以及一个可玩的亚种族。",
	"The {@table Influence of Dyrrn|ExploringEberron} table gives examples of threats that could arise either in a subterranean colony or on the surface itself. These things aren't common, and clan soldiers are ever wary to repel threats, but these ideas could drive a story set in a Mror community.": "{@table Influence of Dyrrn|ExploringEberron}表给出了可能出现在地下殖民地或地表本身的威胁的例子。这些东西并不常见，氏族士兵永远警惕地击退威胁，但这些想法可以推动一个以Moror社区为背景的故事。",
	"It's important to recognize the scope of the conflict in the depths. No one knows the full size of the Realm Below, though it appears to stretch across the Ironroot Mountains, and connects to multiple demiplanes in Khyber. There's a good chance it exists below every major Mror city, but not every spire has broken through and made a connection to Sol Udar. When creating adventures in a Mror city, decide if there is an established passage to the Realm Below; if so, is it a simple passage, or is there a subterranean fortress or colony? In a spire with no known connection, a cult could be secretly digging to try to reach their aberrant masters. Or a clan could have opened a passage beneath its keep but lacked the courage to explore it—a job for adventurers.": "认识到深层冲突的范围是很重要的。没有人知道地下世界的全部规模，尽管它似乎横跨铁根山脉，并与开伯尔的多个半位面相连接。它很有可能存在于每个主要的Moror城市下面，但不是每个尖顶都能突破并与Sol Udar建立联系。当在一个Moror城市创建冒险时，决定是否有一个既定的通道通往下面的领域；如果有，是一个简单的通道，还是有一个地下要塞或殖民地？在一个没有已知联系的尖顶上，一个邪教组织可能正在秘密地挖掘，试图接触他们的反常主人。或者，一个部族可能已经在它的堡垒下打开了一条通道，但却缺乏勇气去探索它--这是冒险者的工作。",
	"To an outsider, the idea of pressing into the Realms Below may seem like madness, but several factors drive the ongoing Mror presence in the depths. The first is a hunger for the wonders that lie below. The ancient dwarves possessed the ability to craft legendary objects and artifacts. They understood Khyber's systems of demiplanes in a way even the Dhakaani haven't mastered; many clan lords dream of bottomless mines or resources that can't be found in the natural world. Beyond the innate desire for these things, for the Mror, it's a matter of pride. Sol Udar is the work of their ancestors. The knowledge that it holds, the untold wealth, this is their birthright. It's a burning reminder that they could be more than they are now—they could be greater than the Five Nations or the Aereni. Additionally, many dwarves are driven by their desire to know the story—to understand who their ancestors were and what became of them.": "对局外人来说，进入地下世界的想法可能看起来很疯狂，但有几个因素推动了Moror在深处的持续存在。首先是对下面的奇迹的渴求。古老的矮人拥有制作传奇物品和文物的能力。他们对开伯尔的半平面系统的理解，甚至连达卡尼人都没有掌握；许多部族的领主都梦想着无底的矿藏或在自然界找不到的资源。除了对这些东西的天生渴望之外，对Moror来说，这也是一个骄傲的问题。Sol Udar是他们祖先的作品。它所拥有的知识，难以计数的财富，这是他们与生俱来的权利。这强烈地提醒他们，他们可以比现在做得更多--他们可以比五国或Aereni更伟大。此外，许多矮人被他们对故事的渴望所驱使--了解他们的祖先是谁，以及他们的结局如何。",
	"If a player character is a Mror noble, the Realm Below can be a tempting opportunity for advancement. The clans hold all lands below their territory. If a noble with a stalwart band of allies can secure an outpost in Sol Udar and fortify against the forces of Dyrrn, they can claim it as their personal estate. This could be a remarkable keep for a party of adventurers—if they are powerful enough to maintain it! The {@table Realm Below Story Hooks|ExploringEberron} table contains some more ideas for why adventurers might delve into the Realm Below.": "如果玩家的角色是一个Moror贵族，下面的境界可以是一个诱人的晋升机会。氏族控制着他们领土以下的所有土地。如果一个贵族和一帮坚定的盟友能在索尔乌达确保一个前哨，并为抵御迪尔恩的力量而设防，他们就可以把它作为自己的个人财产。对于冒险者队伍来说，这可能是一个了不起的堡垒--如果他们有足够的力量来维持它的话! {@table Realm Below Story Hooks|ExploringEberron}表包含了更多关于冒险者可能深入地下世界的想法。",
	"The lines between regions secured by the Mror and those held by Dyrrn's forces are clearly marked. As the aberrations generally don't come to the surface, there are places where the uppermost passage has simply been sealed with magic and steel. In other places where the dwarves have established colonies, the edge of the colony is heavily fortified and patrolled by soldiers, ever alert for some new attack. In most cases, soldiers won't prevent someone from proceeding into the depths—but anyone returning goes through careful scrutiny to ensure they haven't been infected by unnatural influences. And if an explorer has returned with treasures, it's considered polite to offer a gift to the guardians.": "由莫尔人控制的区域和由迪尔恩的部队控制的区域之间的界限被清楚地标明。由于反常者一般不会出现在地面上，所以有些地方的最上层通道只是被魔法和钢铁封住了。在其他矮人建立了殖民地的地方，殖民地的边缘有重兵把守，并有士兵巡逻，时刻警惕着新的攻击。在大多数情况下，士兵不会阻止某人进入深处--但任何返回的人都要经过仔细审查，以确保他们没有被非自然的影响所感染。如果一个探险家带着宝物回来，向守护者提供一份礼物被认为是一种礼貌。",
	"The Realm Below blends the civilization of Sol Udar with the alien touch of the daelkyr. The dwarves of Sol Udar were an advanced civilization employing arcane science beyond that currently possessed by the Five Nations. The halls were shaped by elemental magic—an improved form of the {@spell move earth} spell—and reinforced to be stronger than any natural stone. Barring any alien influence, the air is renewed by magic and remarkably fresh; a permanent prestidigitation effect keeps these halls clean after thousands of years and untold conflicts. Ultimately, venturing into this environment can be somewhat eerie: though there may have been a brutal battle there just months ago, the halls are silent and pristine.": "下层世界融合了索尔乌达的文明和达尔凯尔的异域风情。索尔乌达的矮人是一个先进的文明，他们使用的奥术科学超出了五国目前拥有的水平。大厅是由元素魔法塑造的--一种改进的{@spell move earth}法术形式--并被强化为比任何天然石头更坚固。在没有任何外来影响的情况下，空气被魔法更新，而且非常新鲜；一个永久的预知效应使这些大厅在几千年和数不清的冲突之后仍然保持清洁。最终，进入这个环境会有些阴森恐怖：尽管几个月前那里可能发生过一场残酷的战斗，但大厅里却寂静而原始。",
	"Widespread magic was a part of daily life in Sol Udar. Explorers might find a chamber where illusory music begins to play as soon as someone enters, or discover a theater still performing ancient entertainment. Many doors are sealed by {@spell arcane lock||arcane locks}, and high-security areas may have self-restoring {@spell glyph of warding||glyphs of warding} or more sophisticated security. The people of Sol Udar weren't warlike by nature. Their halls contain great forges and foundries, but many of their wonders are utilitarian. An Udar kitchen has tools that replicate the heating, chilling, and flavoring effects of {@spell prestidigitation}, and might have a builtin {@item alchemy jug} to dispense whatever liquids are needed. Of course, not all enchantments are automatically noticeable, and many effects require some form of command word or gesture to activate; modern colonists who have settled in the upper levels of Sol Udar are still struggling to understand the full capabilities of their new home.": "广泛的魔法是索尔乌达日常生活的一部分。探险者可能会发现一个密室，里面只要有人进入就会开始播放虚幻的音乐，或者发现一个仍在表演古代娱乐节目的剧院。许多门都被{@spell arcane lock||arcane locks}封住了，而高度安全的区域可能有自我恢复{@spell glyph of warding||glyphs of warding}或更复杂的安全设施。索尔乌达的人本质上并不好战。他们的大厅里有伟大的锻造厂和铸造厂，但他们的许多奇迹是功利性的。一个乌达人的厨房有复制加热、冷却和调味效果的工具（%2%），并可能有一个内置的（%3%）来分配任何需要的液体。当然，并不是所有的魔法都能自动察觉，许多效果需要某种形式的命令词或手势来激活；在索尔-乌达上层定居的现代殖民者仍在努力理解他们新家的全部功能。",
	"The dwarves of Sol Udar also took advantage of the many demiplanes that lie within Khyber, identifying passages to them and building around them, just as the people of the surface build around manifest zones. A typical demiplane portal is clearly marked and heavily secured, of great potential value—and danger—as they can break the laws of the natural world. Demiplanes are entirely unpredictable in size, some no larger than a town, with others the size of Khorvaire itself. Within a demiplane, time might run differently. Gemstones could grow on trees. A demiplane can have its own sun, and provide vegetation and other resources that couldn't be found in any natural cave. But a demiplane could also hold strange curses, unnatural diseases, or deadly creatures—or in the case of Dyrrn's prison-realm, all three.": "索尔-乌达的矮人也利用了开伯尔境内的许多半位面，确定了通往它们的通道，并围绕它们进行建设，就像地表的人们围绕显灵区进行建设一样。一个典型的半位面入口有明确的标记和严格的安全保护，具有巨大的潜在价值和危险性，因为它们可以打破自然界的规律。半位面的大小是完全不可预测的，有些不比一个镇子大，有些则有霍尔韦尔本身那么大。在一个半平面内，时间可能以不同的方式运行。宝石可以在树上生长。一个半平面可以有自己的太阳，并提供植被和其他资源，这在任何自然洞穴中都是找不到的。但一个半位面也可能有奇怪的诅咒、非自然的疾病或致命的生物，或者在迪尔恩的监狱领域中，三种都有。",
	"The Realm Below isn't one single contiguous community. It was an entire nation, one that stretched at least the length of the Ironroot Mountains. There are major cities, small outposts, and long passages connecting them. The Realm Below likely had some form of rapid transit: Teleportation circles? Something similar to the lightning rail? A system tied to demiplanes? Whatever this was, it has yet to be discovered, and may lie on the lower levels held by Dyrrn's minions. In creating a section of the Realm Below for an adventure, the DM should think about the purpose of this particular area. Was it an industrial center? A residential community? A hospital? A prison? If it contains a passage to a demiplane, the nature of the demiplane should relate to the function of the community; if it's a hospital, perhaps the local demiplane has alien vegetation that has remarkable medicinal properties. But what unknown threats could dwell in the demiplane—threats the ancient dwarves knew to avoid?": "下界并不是一个单一的连片社区。它是一个完整的国家，一个至少延伸到铁根山的长度。有主要的城市，有小的前哨站，还有连接它们的漫长通道。下面的境界很可能有某种形式的快速交通。传送圈？类似于闪电轨道的东西？一个与半飞行器相联系的系统？不管是什么，它都还没有被发现，可能就在迪尔恩的爪牙把持的低层。在为冒险创造下层世界的一个部分时，管理员应该考虑这个特定区域的目的。它是一个工业中心吗？住宅区？医院？监狱？如果这里有一条通往半位面的通道，那么半位面的性质应该与社区的功能有关；如果是医院，也许当地的半位面有外来的植物，具有显著的药性。但是，半位面中可能居住着什么未知的威胁--古代矮人知道要避免的威胁？",
	"Dyrrn's minions have spread throughout the lower reaches of Sol Udar. Areas inhabited by aberrations are generally easy to spot. Often, organic matter covers the surfaces of the buildings. Explorers have encountered fleshlike coating, with tendrils of muscle spread out like spiderwebs; organic fluids that move along the walls, a harmless form of living ooze; floating, bioluminescent globes that could be neurons in a vast brain; and other, stranger things. There are strange smells and sounds. People often experience telepathic static, hearing thoughts of people around them or having flashes of alien imagery. Areas infested by the daelkyr may use any of the traps found in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, but in this realm, hazards are generally {@i alive}. A falling net is a web-like membrane secreted by the ceiling. Poison darts are chitinous stingers grown by the walls. These traps can still be evaded by the standard methods, though at the DM's discretion, unusual skills could also apply; perhaps an organic poison needle trap could be disarmed with a Dexterity ({@skill Medicine}) check instead of using thieves' tools.": "迪尔恩的爪牙已经遍布索尔乌达的下游地区。反常者居住的地区通常很容易发现。通常，有机物覆盖在建筑物的表面。探险家们遇到了类似肉体的涂层，肌肉的卷须像蜘蛛网一样散开；沿着墙壁移动的有机液体，一种无害的活体渗出物；漂浮的生物发光球，可能是一个巨大大脑中的神经元；以及其他更奇怪的东西。有奇怪的气味和声音。人们经常体验到心灵感应的静电，听到周围人的想法，或有外来图像的闪现。被戴尔基尔侵扰的地区可以使用在（%0%）中发现的任何陷阱，但在这个领域，危险一般是（%1%）。落网是由天花板分泌的网状薄膜。毒镖是由墙壁长出的几丁质的刺。这些陷阱仍然可以用标准的方法来躲避，不过由DM决定，不寻常的技能也可以适用；也许一个有机毒针陷阱可以用灵巧（（%2%））检查来解除，而不是使用盗贼的工具。",
	"Dyrrn's specialty is corruption, both mental and physical. Thus it has created creatures like the dolgrims and dolgaunts—goblinoids physically transformed into monsters, the most prolific denizens of the dark—as well as the derro, who still bear some resemblance to the dwarves they once were, but whose minds have been altered.": "Dyrrn的专长是腐败，包括精神和身体。因此，它创造了像多尔格林斯和多尔冈茨这样的生物--在身体上变成怪物的妖精，是黑暗中最多产的居民--以及德鲁人，他们与曾经的矮人仍有一些相似之处，但他们的思想已经被改变了。",
	"Dolgaunts often command units of dolgrims, but dolgaunts can also be found acting alone or maintaining strange shrines. The statistics presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} represent the typical creature, but unique dols can have greater abilities. Dols are capable of acting with surprising discipline and precision, but their strategies are often unorthodox and enigmatic.": "多尔衮经常指挥多尔衮的部队，但也可以发现多尔衮单独行动或维护奇怪的神龛。以{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}表示的统计数据代表了典型的生物，但独特的多尔人可以有更大的能力。多尔人能够以惊人的纪律性和精确性行动，但他们的策略往往是非正统的和神秘的。",
	"Derro aren't aberrations, but are believed to be dwarves twisted by Dyrrn's power. There may be derro whose roots go back to the ancient dwarves who built Sol Udar; however, the common assumption is that the derro are the descendants of the lost dwarves of Noldrunhold. Other derro could be more recent victims, created from Mror settlers captured in the Dol Udar. The derro are nomadic scavengers who remain in constant motion, roaming the deep tunnels of the Realm Below. They completely ignore Dyrrn's aberrations, and seem to be ignored in turn; one scout reported seeing a derro band walk through a dolgrim camp, without acknowledgment from either side. Some scholars believe that the derro can't perceive the aberrations, and that some believe themselves to be in a reality in which Sol Udar is still in its time of glory, and the derro are its lords. They don't appear to serve Dyrrn directly, but they definitely see all outsiders from above as enemies. A derro warlord calling himself Lord Mror has repeatedly attacked Mror colonies; however, it's unclear if this is a single powerful derro with followers across the realm, or if several derro savants use this title.": "德鲁并不是异类，而是被认为是被迪尔恩的力量扭曲的矮人。可能有一些德鲁人的根源可以追溯到建造索尔乌达的古代矮人；然而，普遍的假设是德鲁人是诺德隆霍德失落的矮人的后代。其他的德鲁人可能是最近的受害者，是由在多尔乌达尔俘虏的摩尔定居者创造的。德鲁人是游牧的清道夫，他们保持着持续的运动，在地下世界的深层隧道里游荡。他们完全无视Dyrrn的反常行为，而且似乎反过来也被无视；一名侦察员报告说看到一支德鲁人队伍穿过多尔格瑞姆营地，双方都没有承认。一些学者认为，德鲁人无法感知反常现象，一些人认为自己处在一个现实中，在这个现实中，索尔乌达仍然处于辉煌时期，而德鲁人是其领主。他们似乎并不直接为Dyrrn服务，但他们肯定将所有来自上面的外来者视为敌人。一个自称Moror勋爵的derro军阀曾多次攻击Moror殖民地；然而，目前还不清楚这是否是一个在整个王国都有追随者的强大derro，还是有几个derro savants使用这个称号。",
	"The daelkyr often hold the most important areas of an Udar site; as such, these dungeons contain both treasures created by the dwarves and the organic tools of the daelkyr. However, the purpose of areas claimed by Dyrrn's forces varies widely. In some cases, there's a clear logic to what these creatures are doing: dolgrims could have seized an ancient foundry and begun forging weapons. Explorers could find some sort of spawning pit where new aberrations are being produced. But the behavior of aberrations is often alien and inexplicable; a chamber could contain a giant, beating heart that serves no apparent purpose, or a pool of liquid that reflects another location. The inhabitants of the depths are unpredictable, and aberrations may not have the same biological needs as natural humanoids; for example, dolgrims don't need to work subterranean farms for food.": "戴尔克尔通常掌握着乌达遗址中最重要的区域；因此，这些地牢中既有矮人创造的宝物，也有戴尔克尔的有机工具。然而，迪尔恩势力所声称的区域的目的差别很大。在某些情况下，这些生物所做的事情有一个清晰的逻辑：多尔恩可能占领了一个古老的铸造厂并开始锻造武器。探索者可以找到某种产卵坑，在那里生产新的畸变体。但畸变体的行为往往是陌生的、无法解释的；一个密室可能包含一个巨大的、跳动的心脏，但没有明显的作用，或者是一池反映另一地点的液体。深处的居民是不可预测的，畸形体可能没有与自然界人类相同的生物需求；例如，Dolgrims不需要在地下农场工作以获得食物。",
	"Some aberrations are permanently settled in a region, but others may spill out of portals to Dyrrn's domain, and others may be grown on the spot by the organic matter spread throughout infested regions, or created from the corpses of foolish explorers. A gibbering mouther may whisper with the voices of the dwarves who ventured into the depths last week.": "有些反常者在一个地区永久定居，但其他反常者可能从通往迪尔恩领域的门户溢出，还有一些反常者可能由遍布受侵扰地区的有机物就地生长，或者由愚蠢的探险者的尸体创造。一个胡言乱语的人可能与上周冒险进入深处的矮人的声音窃窃私语。",
	"While mind flayers can be found serving any daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is their creator. Sol Udar is thus a logical place to encounter mind flayers or any creatures associated with them: intellect devourers, ulitharids, neothelids, and the like. Bear in mind that these creatures may serve a very different role in Eberron than in other settings, as they are the creations of Dyrrn; a neothelid may be an intentional creation, as opposed to an accidental abomination. Elder brains are tools used as telepathic anchors, linking local mind flayers, while the elder brains are linked to Dyrrn itself. In general, mind flayers serve as Dyrrn's emissaries and lieutenants—directing lesser aberrations or humanoid cults, or engaged in inscrutable research. The most infamous mind flayer is Dyrrashar, the ulitharid who delivered Dyrrn's Promise. It has appeared multiple times since then, often leading subtle attacks against Udar colonies.": "虽然可以找到为任何daelkyr服务的思想传播者，但腐蚀者Dyrrn是他们的创造者。因此，索尔-乌达尔是一个符合逻辑的地方，可以遇到思想絮乱者或任何与之相关的生物：智力吞噬者、乌利塔里德、新泰尔德，以及类似的生物。请记住，这些生物在Eberron中的作用可能与其他环境中的非常不同，因为它们是Dyrrn的创造物；neothelid可能是一种有意的创造物，而不是一种意外的憎恶。长老的大脑是用作心灵感应的工具，它连接着当地的心灵传播者，而长老的大脑则连接着Dyrrn本身。一般来说，噬心者是迪伦的使者和副手--指挥较小的反常者或人形邪教，或从事难以捉摸的研究。最臭名昭著的读心者是Dyrrashar，他是传递Dyrrn承诺的ulitharid。此后，它多次出现，经常领导对乌达殖民地的微妙攻击。",
	"Most other threats are encountered in isolation, and almost any sort of aberration could be found in the darkness; you can also use unusual variations of aberrations or monstrosities, shifting the creature to fit your story. For example, beholders primarily serve Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes, but Dyrrn could have beholder servitors with beaks surrounded with tentacles, as opposed to toothy maws.": "大多数其他威胁都是在孤立的情况下遇到的，在黑暗中几乎可以找到任何种类的畸变；你也可以使用畸变或怪兽的不寻常的变体，将生物转变为适合你的故事。例如，目击者主要服务于眼睛之主Belashyrra，但Dyrrn可以让目击者的仆人长着嘴，周围有触手，而不是牙齿的大嘴。",
	"A tool's a tool. I don't care if my axe is made of steel or bone; I care about its edge. Our people found gold and iron beneath the mountains. We seized that opportunity and we prospered.

	"The first Mror dwarves to explore Sol Udar were amazed at the treasures they found. While there was no sign of the original inhabitants, their possessions remained. Early explorers found remarkable jewelry, intriguing artwork, and caskets of coins—but magic items were often the most valuable. Many of these are like those found in the Five Nations, with a focus on practicality—items such as the {@item alchemy jug}, {@item bag of holding}, or {@item decanter of endless water}. While similar items are produced in the Five Nations, the arcane techniques used are intriguing, and some items displayed superior qualities; one team of scouts found an alchemy keg that's bulkier than the standard jug, but can produce twice the amount of liquid each day—and the alcohol it produces is far more potent than that of a standard {@item alchemy jug}. The {@table Sol Udar Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table presents some interesting items, both magical and mundane, that might be found adventuring in the Realm Below.": "第一批探索索尔-乌达的Moror矮人对他们发现的宝藏感到惊奇。虽然没有原始居民的迹象，但他们的财产仍然存在。早期的探险家们发现了非凡的珠宝、耐人寻味的艺术品和一箱箱的硬币--但魔法物品往往是最有价值的。其中许多就像在五国发现的一样，注重实用性--如（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）等物品。虽然五国也生产类似的物品，但所使用的奥秘技术却耐人寻味，有些物品显示出卓越的品质；一队侦察兵发现了一个炼金桶，它比标准壶更笨重，但每天可以生产两倍的液体，而且它生产的酒精远比标准的（%3%）更有效。{@table Sol Udar Trinkets|ExploringEberron}表格介绍了一些有趣的物品，包括魔法和世俗的，可能会在地下世界的冒险中发现。",
	"Beyond the minor curiosities scattered throughout Sol Udar, there were far greater treasures—legendary magic items and artifacts, things that can't be created in the present day. Only a few of these wonders have been found, and these have become a source of immense pride for the clans that possess them. It's common for a clan to declare such items to be the work of their ancestors, though this is typically a talespinner's fancy. Little concrete scholarship has been done on most of these treasures, and despite the commonly accepted myth of the dwarven exile, there's no reason to think that the ancestors of the modern Mror were all distributed evenly around the mountains, their descendants just happening to have remained exactly above their ancestral homes. Nonetheless, these relics are seen as proof of the power and potential of a clan, and most clan leaders don't look kindly on outsiders questioning their stories. Surely even more powerful and precious artifacts remain to be found in the deeper layers of the Realm Below, but the Dol Udar has kept the Mror from claiming these wonders.": "除了散落在索尔乌达的小奇物之外，还有更多的宝藏--传奇的魔法物品和神器，这些东西在当今时代是无法创造的。这些奇迹中只有少数被发现，而这些已经成为拥有它们的部族的巨大骄傲的来源。一个部族宣布这类物品是他们祖先的作品是很常见的，尽管这通常是一个讲故事的人的幻想。对这些宝物的具体研究很少，尽管普遍接受了矮人流亡的神话，但没有理由认为现代Moror的祖先都是均匀地分布在山区，他们的后代只是恰好留在了他们祖先的家园之上。尽管如此，这些遗物被看作是一个部族的力量和潜力的证明，大多数部族领袖对外人质疑他们的故事不以为然。当然，在地下世界的更深层，还有更多强大而珍贵的文物有待发现，但多尔-乌达一直阻止着摩尔人对这些奇迹的索取。",
	"While battling aberrations and making expeditions into infested layers, the dwarves recovered another unusual treasure—symbionts, living tools crafted by the daelkyr. Chapter 7 presents eight new symbionts that might be found in the Realm Below. Many clans want nothing to do with these foul things; Doldarun dwarves always burn symbionts with the corpses of the creatures that carry them. But not all dwarves share this distaste. Some clans see symbionts as just another form of treasure from the depths. The Toldorath and Droranath dwarves have no fear of symbionts, and a warrior may carry a {@i hungry axe} (as described in chapter 7) without protest from their clan; but these clans haven't embraced symbionts beyond keeping the trophies taken from fallen enemies. Both Soldorak and Narathun have gone further; in addition to using salvaged symbionts, these clans have spent decades studying the science behind these items and creating their own symbionts. In some cases, they are replicating existing items, but Soldorak fleshcrafters have also created unique symbionts, integrating the principles of daelkyr magic with their own arcane traditions. Those clans that favor such tools call fleshcrafted items {@i dolaur}—spoils of war. On the other hand, those that despise them often call symbionts and those who use them {@i dularash}—foul blood—a term often used to refer to spoiled meat or corrupted bloodlines.": "在与反常者作战并对出没的地层进行考察时，矮人找到了另一种不寻常的宝物--共生体，即由戴尔基尔制作的生活工具。第七章介绍了八种可能在下层世界发现的新共生体。许多部族都不想和这些肮脏的东西扯上关系；多达伦的矮人总是把共生体和携带它们的生物的尸体一起烧掉。但并不是所有的矮人都有这种厌恶感。有些部族将共生体视为来自深渊的另一种形式的宝物。Toldorath和Droranath矮人对共生体没有恐惧感，战士可以携带（%0%）（如第七章所述），而不会遭到部族的抗议；但这些部族除了保留从倒下的敌人身上夺来的战利品外，并没有接受共生体。索多拉克和纳拉逊都走得更远；除了使用打捞上来的共生体，这些部族还花了几十年时间研究这些物品背后的科学，并创造了自己的共生体。在某些情况下，他们是在复制现有的物品，但索多拉克的肉体制造者也创造了独特的共生体，将daelkyr魔法的原理与他们自己的奥术传统相结合。那些喜欢这种工具的部族把肉体制作的物品称为{@i dolaur}--战争的废品。另一方面，那些鄙视它们的人通常称共生体和使用它们的人为（%2%）--肮脏的血液--这个词通常用来指变质的肉或腐败的血统。",
	"Many existing magic items can be reflavored as symbionts. A Soldorak artificer might create a {@item cloak of elvenkind}, but formed of leathery, living flesh that shifts in hue like a chameleon. A Narathun {@item rope of climbing|XGE} isn't rope at all, but a coiled tentacle that follows the commands of the creature holding it. The Soldorak have created {@i lighting bugs}—identical in function to {@item everbright lantern||everbright lanterns}, but able to cling or detach to a surface on command. These bugs need to be fed a few drops of blood each day, and in communities that use these, the former lamplighters now walk the streets to feed the bugs from their own body.": "许多现有的魔法物品可以作为共生体被重新调味。一个索多拉克工匠可能会创造一个（%0%），但是由皮革状的活肉形成，像变色龙一样变换着颜色。Narathun{@item rope of climbing|XGE}根本不是绳子，而是一个盘绕的触手，听从握着它的生物的命令。索多拉克人创造了{@i lighting bugs}--与{@item everbright lantern||everbright lanterns}的功能相同，但能够按照指令附着或分离到表面。这些虫子每天需要被喂食几滴血，在使用这些虫子的社区，以前的点灯人现在走街串巷，用自己的身体喂食这些虫子。",
	"Outsiders may be horrified by these living tools, but the motives of dwarves that use them are rational to many of their people. To many Mror, these items are trophies, concrete proof of Mror victories over the daelkyr: \"If you took a magic axe from a fallen foe, you'd be a fool to throw it away. So what if it moans when it kills? It's a powerful weapon, and it's mine by right of conquest!\" Many Mror also see carrying these tools as a sign of their courage, proudly demonstrating they aren't afraid to put on living armor. They may bask in the fear that their treasures instill in their enemies. In addition, both Soldorak and Narathun are ambitious clans, and leaders hope that by unlocking the secrets of fleshcrafting, they can increase the power of their clans.": "外人可能会对这些活生生的工具感到恐惧，但对许多人来说，使用这些工具的矮人的动机是合理的。对许多Moror来说，这些物品是战利品，是Moror战胜daelkyr的具体证明。\"如果你从一个倒下的敌人身上拿了一把魔斧，把它扔掉就太傻了。如果它在杀人时发出呻吟，那又如何？这是一个强大的武器，它是我征服的权利！\" 许多Moror还把携带这些工具看作是他们勇气的象征，自豪地表明他们不害怕穿上活的盔甲。他们可能会沉浸在他们的宝物给敌人带来的恐惧之中。此外，索多拉克和纳拉逊都是雄心勃勃的部族，他们的领导人希望通过解开肉体制造的秘密，可以提高他们部族的力量。",
	"Those clans that revile symbionts say that fleshcrafting is an abomination and an affront to Aureon and Onatar. The Narathun counter that Onatar is the master artisan and can work with any material; it is the doubters who insult Onatar by thinking his servants can't master this new medium. This argument has found supporters in Clan Soranath; while the Soranath dwarves don't fully embrace symbionts as the Soldorak and Narathun do, they are interested in the science of fleshcrafting and have been studying these techniques.": "那些蔑视共生体的部族说，肉体制作是一种可憎的行为，是对奥里昂和奥纳塔的侮辱。纳拉逊人反驳说，奥纳塔是工匠大师，可以使用任何材料；正是那些怀疑者认为奥纳塔的仆人无法掌握这种新媒介，从而侮辱了奥纳塔。这一论点在索拉纳特氏族中找到了支持者；虽然索拉纳特矮人并不像索多拉克和纳拉逊那样完全接受共生体，但他们对肉体制作的科学感兴趣，并一直在研究这些技术。",
	"The clans that embrace these techniques say that there is no danger, that this is just another form of science, while Doldarun dwarves insist that there can be no traffic with the daelkyr without corruption. The DM will have to decide the truth—can Soldorak benefit from their exploration of fleshcrafting, or are their warlocks and artificers being corrupted by Dyrrn? Whatever the truth of it, tensions between those clans who embrace these tools and those who revile them continue to rise.": "接受这些技术的部族说没有危险，这只是另一种形式的科学，而多尔达伦矮人则坚持认为，没有腐败就不可能有与达尔凯尔的交流。DM将不得不决定真相--索多拉克能从他们对肉体工艺的探索中获益，还是他们的术士和工匠正在被Dyrrn腐蚀？无论真相如何，接受这些工具的部族和蔑视这些工具的部族之间的紧张关系继续上升。",
	"A character exploring the fleshcrafting techniques could be an artificer, describing their spellcasting as being tied to organic tools. Other arcane scholars who explore the techniques of the daelkyr become warlocks, typically using the Great Old One as their patron. In creating a Mror warlock, consider whether you're bargaining with Dyrrn itself—are you a cultist of the Dragon Below, willing to serve the daelkyr to gain power? Or have you gained your powers from studying the daelkyr and their methods, but instead of serving them, you're essentially stealing their techniques and hacking their systems? If you follow the latter path, you might not have a literal patron at all, or your \"patron\" could be a cabal of other dwarves studying the same techniques, and their requests help all of you learn more about fleshcrafting. Or if your DM is willing, perhaps you can even tap into the telepathic network of Dyrrn and the elder brains to steal their secrets; rather than receiving requests from your \"patron,\" you gain flashes of insight or information about them—attacks that are going to happen, plans you might stop—that could drive your actions.": "探索肉体制造技术的人物可以成为工匠，将他们的法术描述为与有机工具相联系。其他探索达尔凯尔（daelkyr）技术的奥术学者则成为术士，通常以伟大的古神为他们的守护者。在创造Moror术士时，要考虑你是否在与Dyrrn本身讨价还价--你是下界龙的崇拜者，愿意为daelkyr服务以获得力量？还是你通过研究达尔凯尔和他们的方法获得了力量，但你不是在为他们服务，而是在偷窃他们的技术和入侵他们的系统？如果你走的是后一条路，你可能根本就没有真正的赞助人，或者你的 \"赞助人 \"可能是一个研究相同技术的其他矮人组成的集团，他们的要求帮助你们所有人学习更多关于肉体制造的知识。或者，如果你的DM愿意的话，也许你甚至可以利用Dyrrn和长老大脑的心灵感应网络来窃取他们的秘密；你不是从你的 \"赞助人 \"那里收到请求，而是获得关于他们的闪光的洞察力或信息--即将发生的攻击，你可能停止的计划--这些都可以推动你的行动。",
	"The Mror Holds are divided into twelve holds, each bearing the name of the ruling clan that exercises authority within that region. These twelve clans are the foundation of Mror culture, and every citizen owes allegiance to one of these clans. This section provides an overview of the twelve ruling clans, including their most remarkable mineral resources, their established feuds, and the virtues they assign to their mythic founder—and thus, the virtues they strive to embody. It's worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing. Clan Doldarun certainly values strength, but in the story, Doldarun's defining feature is his courage and integrity, while Droranath is known for his untamable strength. Likewise, while each clan includes suggestions for possible character classes, any character could come from any clan; in particular, talespinner bards and entertainers are found in every clan.": "姆罗尔领地分为12个领地，每个领地都有在该地区行使权力的统治部族的名字。这十二个部族是Moror文化的基础，每个公民都效忠于其中一个部族。本节概述了十二个统治部族的情况，包括他们最出色的矿产资源、他们的宿怨以及他们赋予神话中的创始人的美德--因此，他们努力体现的美德。值得注意的是，几乎所有的Moror都重视这些美德中的许多，但在他们的故事中，有一位创始人被公认为在那件事上最出色。多尔达伦氏族当然重视力量，但在故事中，多尔达伦的决定性特征是他的勇气和正直，而德洛拉纳特则以其不可驯服的力量著称。同样，虽然每个部族都包括可能的角色类别建议，但任何角色都可能来自任何部族；特别是，每个部族都有讲故事的吟游诗人和艺人。",
	"While all Mror are bound to one of the ruling clans, there are many lesser clans, and below those, tenant families. In creating a Mror character, it's up to you whether your character is tied directly to a ruling clan or if you're part of a lesser family. While many Mror take inspiration from their ruling clan, they don't all share the same virtues; in creating a Mror family of your own, you can decide what their celebrated virtues are.": "虽然所有的Moror都与一个统治部族有联系，但还有许多较小的部族，以及在这些部族之下的佃户家庭。在创建Moror角色时，你可以决定你的角色是直接与统治氏族联系在一起，还是属于一个较小的家族。虽然许多Moror从他们的统治氏族中获得灵感，但他们并不都有相同的美德；在创建一个属于你自己的Moror家族时，你可以决定他们的著名美德是什么。",
	"Among the Mror, the dwarven subraces largely reflect their culture and personal aptitude, not bloodlines, and a Mror dwarf can take any subrace. For example, mountain dwarves have expanded martial training, likely due to militia service in Dol Udar, while dwarves with the Mark of Warding have a blood tie to House Kundarak in their family tree.": "在摩尔人中，矮人的亚种主要反映了他们的文化和个人能力，而不是血统，摩尔矮人可以选择任何亚种。例如，山地矮人扩大了武术训练，可能是由于在多尔-乌达的民兵服务，而拥有守护印记的矮人在他们的家谱中与昆达拉克家族有血缘关系。",

There are countless tales of Doldarun facing terrifying monsters, fiends, and undead; if you need an exorcist in the Mror Holds, Doldarunhold is your best bet.": "多尔达伦氏族的传说者说，他们的传奇创始人是多尔-多恩和多尔-阿拉的孩子，而多尔达伦霍尔的矮人将此铭记于心。多尔达伦的士兵一直是矮人中训练有素、纪律最严明的战士，他们最愿意为了大家的利益而冒着生命危险。多尔达伦面对可怕的怪物、恶魔和亡灵的故事数不胜数；如果你在莫尔霍尔需要一个驱魔人，多尔达伦霍尔是你最好的选择。",

In the meantime, Doldarun draws a hard line against trafficking with the daelkyr or any form of fleshcrafting, and any outsider carrying symbionts receives a very hostile reaction in Doldarunhold. Clan Doldarun has an ancient feud with Clan Soldorak, and denounced Narathun twenty years ago over Narathun fleshcrafting.": "多尔达伦在下面的战争中损失惨重；部分原因是它是最有决心赢得战争而不是接受目前的僵局的部族，许多多尔达伦士兵在对肮脏的敌人的大胆打击中死亡。该部族在银刃堡下面保留了一个驻扎的殖民地，并正在为新的攻势积蓄力量。同时，多尔达伦对贩卖达尔基尔人或任何形式的肉体制造都采取了严厉的态度，任何携带共生体的外来者在多尔达伦霍德都会受到非常敌对的反应。多尔达伦部族与索尔多拉克部族有着古老的恩怨，二十年前因纳拉逊的肉体技艺而谴责了纳拉逊。",

Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called {@i tra dolhass}—the battle cry—a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The \"Mror Howlers\" are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors.

This ties to the mythic story of Mroranon as the leader—Doldarun is a mighty champion, but Mroranon has the vision. Mroranon are strong supporters of the Sovereign Host and believe that the dwarves are blessed; many of the most devout Mror priests and powerful adepts hail from Mroranonhold.": "莫洛拉农矮人对他们作为战士和谈判者的技能感到自豪，即使他们承认多达伦和科尔卡伦是这些领域的佼佼者。使Mororanon人与众不同的是领导力。Mroranon看到了未来，并激励其他人跟随。Mroranon团结起来，为所有人的利益做出明智的决定。这与神话故事中Mororanon的领袖地位有关--Doldarun是一个强大的冠军，但Mororanon有远见。姆罗拉农是主宰者的坚定支持者，相信矮人是受祝福的；许多最虔诚的姆罗牧师和强大的神职人员都来自姆罗拉农霍德。",
	"With the largest and most industrialized territory, Mroranon has the deepest investment in the Realm Below. It has multiple colony outposts, including one tied to a demiplane mine and another holding an ancient fortress, and is holding a firm line while building power for another surge.

Narathun was renowned for its magewrights, especially its oracles; while they draw rubies and sapphires from their mines and produce beautiful jewelry, secrets have always been one of Narathunhold's primary exports. Narathun dwarves appreciate tragedy and sacrifices. The clan is known for its artists and its bards; its work is unquestionably beautiful, but certainly more morbid than that of other clans; it's no accident that its largest city is called Shadowspire.": "Narathun是一个小部族，但一直拥有权力。神话中的英雄Narathun是流亡者中孤独的魔法师，他们的人囤积了这些知识。Narathun以其魔力而闻名，尤其是它的神谕；虽然他们从矿场中提取红宝石和蓝宝石，并生产美丽的珠宝，但秘密一直是Narathunhold的主要出口之一。Narathun矮人欣赏悲剧和牺牲。该部族以其艺术家和吟游诗人而闻名；其作品无疑是美丽的，但肯定比其他部族的作品更加病态；其最大的城市被称为Shadowspire，这并非偶然。",

Narathun artificers have embraced the study of fleshcrafting; while they are no match for Mordain the Fleshweaver, they have made remarkable developments over the past few decades.": "在现代，加里法尔的龙纹屋和传统给所有的人带来了魔法权利。但它的神谕仍然受到尊重，而影子之城的埃邦图书馆是霍尔韦尔最好的占卜学校之一。Narathun的圣人总是断言，任何知识都不应该被禁止，而Shadowspire拥有影子和沃尔之血的神庙。 Narathun氏族对地下世界很着迷，尽管它缺乏力量来深入Sol Udar，而Narathun的赞助人很可能雇用冒险者，愿意在深处冒生命危险。纳拉逊的工匠们已经接受了肉体制造的研究；虽然他们无法与肉体制造者莫尔丹相比，但在过去几十年里，他们已经取得了显著的发展。",

However, the other clans value its jewels and its knowledge, and others have always stood in between Narathun and Doldarun. Soldorak and Narathun are staunch allies, reinforced by their interest in the Realm Below.": "纳拉逊矮人积怨已久。他们从未原谅托尔达农和托尔多拉斯在巴尔-杜洛尔之前发生的盗窃行为，并鄙视德洛拉纳特在八个世纪前发生的谋杀。多尔达伦长期以来一直谴责纳拉逊的 \"肮脏行为\"，而其对肉体制作的追求更加剧了这种情况。然而，其他部族重视它的珠宝和知识，其他部族一直站在纳拉逊和多尔达伦之间。索多拉克和纳拉逊是坚定的盟友，他们对下层世界的兴趣使他们的关系更加紧密。",

In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.": "在矮人语中，（%0%）意味着 \"王国的捍卫者\"。虽然大多数摩尔人的传说都把传说中的摩尔领主描述成一个睿智而强大的领袖，但索朗格普的故事家们说，摩尔领主是一个铁腕的暴君--英雄索多拉克为了普通人的利益挑战了摩尔，正是这一点导致了流放的发生。在所有的故事中，索尔多拉都支持弱者，挑战过时的制度和压迫性的权威。在某些方面，这与索尔多拉克仍然属于定义了一千年的封建制度的事实相抵触。然而，索多拉克比其他部族更灵活。租户家庭有一条成为自由人的道路，而且和艾瑞尼家族一样，索多拉克也力图把各行各业最有才华的矮人吸引到统治家族中来。然而，这是一把双刃剑；人们也可以被驱逐出统治部族，而且继承人要不断证明他们的价值和狡猾，而不是简单地依靠他们的名字的力量。",
	"This principle is the cornerstone of the Soldorak character. \"Power must be earned. The ends justify the means.\" They believe the common concept of \"honor\" is a trick that serves those in power; true honor lies in using your wits to defeat impossible odds. It was this principle that led clan nobles to found the Aurum, originally as a nexus for acts of rebellion against Galifar; today it continues to counterbalance the influence of foreign aristocrats and dragonmarked houses.": "这一原则是索多拉克性格的基石。\"权力必须赢得。目的是为了证明手段的正确性\"。他们认为常见的 \"荣誉 \"概念是为掌权者服务的把戏；真正的荣誉在于用你的智慧去战胜不可能战胜的困难。正是这一原则导致氏族贵族们创立了奥鲁姆，最初是作为反叛加里法尔行为的纽带；今天，它继续制衡着外国贵族和龙纹屋的影响。",
	"Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of {@i dolaur}—symbionts—and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarf artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That's the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe—that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them—but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.": "索多拉克是人口最多、也是最富有的领地之一。它的财富在于各种贵金属，尤其是铂金和黄金；索多拉克铸币厂的硬币在整个霍尔韦尔流通，而且索多拉克有许多外国投资。它在地下世界进行了大量投资，在地下资产方面仅次于莫拉农氏族。然而，索多拉克已经接受了{@i dolaur}--共生体的使用，并继续探索daelkyr的外来力量，甚至在回收矮人神器的同时。索多拉克也接受了术士的道路。与他们在纳拉逊的盟友相比，这些矮人对奥术研究的耐心较少，也不太可能成为工匠或巫师。但是为权力讨价还价，用你的智慧和意志赢得超自然的礼物？这就是索多拉克的方式。索尔多拉克坚持认为这种传统是完全安全的--索尔术士可以在不为他们服务的情况下利用daelkyr的力量--但多达伦确信所有索尔多拉克的矮人都是腐败的，而莫洛伦认为这种肮脏的做法是诋毁其对手的另一种方式。",
	"While it's home to nobles and soldiers, Soldorakhold also has more than its fair share of charlatans and criminals. It's a haven for all manner of rogues and warlocks, especially Great Old One warlocks manipulating the powers of the daelkyr. While outsiders view the Soldorak as evil, they are primarily about challenging tradition and refusing to accept unearned authority; a Soldorak folk hero could champion underdogs anywhere in Khorvaire. Soldorak dwarves are typically skeptical of organized religion; there are relatively few temples in the region, and clerics and acolytes are uncommon.": "虽然这里是贵族和士兵的家，但索多克霍德也有不少骗子和罪犯。这里是各种流氓和术士的天堂，尤其是操纵达尔凯尔之力的伟大的老一辈术士。虽然外人认为索多拉克人是邪恶的，但他们主要是挑战传统，拒绝接受不劳而获的权威；索多拉克人的民间英雄可以在霍尔韦尔的任何地方为弱势者辩护。索多拉克矮人通常对有组织的宗教持怀疑态度；该地区的寺庙相对较少，神职人员和圣徒也不常见。",

But Soranath artisans are unmatched in their techniques and their work ethic. Rather than being bound by secrets of the past, Soranath smiths are always looking for ways to improve their techniques, searching for new sources of inspiration. While this sounds impressive, Soranath is a small hold with limited resources, without the capabilities either in research or production of House Cannith or the Arcane Congress. The artisans of Clan Soranath won't change the world with their works, but they produce remarkable things for those who can afford it.": "并非所有的工匠都来自索拉那斯，就像并非所有索拉那斯霍德的居民都是工匠一样。在Mororanonhold的大多数刀片是由Mororanon的铁匠锻造的。但索拉那斯的工匠在技术和职业道德方面是无与伦比的。索拉纳特的工匠们没有被过去的秘密所束缚，而是一直在寻找改进他们技术的方法，寻找新的灵感来源。虽然这听起来令人印象深刻，但索拉纳特是一个资源有限的小王国，在研究和生产方面都没有坎尼斯家族或奥术大会的能力。索拉纳斯家族的工匠们不会用他们的作品来改变世界，但他们为那些买得起的人制作了非凡的东西。",

Industry is the prime virtue of Soranath, and its people work hard and live austere lives; for Soranath dwarves, a job done well is more satisfying than any luxury. Soranath has abundant deposits of dragonshard geodes, and thus isn't dependent on Tharashk, but doesn't seek to challenge Tharashk as an exporter of shards. Due to its otherwise limited resources, Soranath is dependent on other clans for many things, including protection. Soranath artificers are fascinated by the potential of the Realm Below and what they could learn both from the Udar artifacts and the symbionts of the daelkyr, and Grayroot Spire has been experimenting with fleshcrafting.

This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.": "Toldorath和Tordannon有很多技能，尽管他们是少数的大师。他们是猎人和牧民，战士和矿工。但最重要的是，他们是流亡者中最有天赋的治疗师，随时准备帮助任何有需要的人。在巴尔-多鲁尔之前，霜冻之城的治疗师在各处都能找到。这种情况随着乔拉斯科家族的到来而改变。今天，莫尔霍尔最好的治疗师是半身人，但矮人仍然在治疗室服务。更重要的是，Toldorath和Tordannon的农场是许多药草和鲜花的主要来源，这些药草和鲜花推动了Jorasco在整个Khorvaire的运作。",
	"At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They're stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans—to family, clan, and the holds themselves.": "乍一看，Toldorath和Tordannon有很多共同之处。他们开采铜矿，在镜湖周围的田野上放养山地部落和其他野兽。当他们必须战斗时，他们是坚忍不拔的战士，但除非被逼无奈，否则他们从不挑起争吵。在其他方面，他们是相当不同的。托尔丹农矮人献身于主宰者，而托尔多拉斯人对宗教的态度是矛盾的。托丹农人在地下战争中损失惨重；他们回避共生体，封锁了他们的深层通道，并生活在对下一次攻击的恐惧中。相比之下，托尔多拉斯人对共生体很感兴趣，并热衷于深入研究索尔乌达。尽管有这些差异，他们还是互相支持。忠诚是这些部族的主要美德之一，对家庭、部族和持有者本身。",
	"But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash'tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy—the modern Jhorash'tar aren't particularly adept healers—but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash'tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.": "但有一件事让这两个冰霜之城的部族脱颖而出：他们对乔拉什塔尔兽人的支持。一个故事说，在流亡的最初几天，一个兽人萨满将治疗术传授给了托尔多拉斯和托尔达农。这可能纯属幻想--现代的Jhorash'tar并不是特别擅长治疗，但无论如何，这两个部族一直在寻求兽人和侏儒之间的和平。这使他们与德洛拉那斯氏族发生了激烈的冲突。也有一些时候，冰霜之城的部族自己也遭受了兽人的伤害，当一个部落为了报复被认为是背叛的行为而打击了托丹农的尖塔。但氏族领主仍然致力于在两个民族之间建立一座桥梁。在过去的一个世纪里，他们推动了让兽人在铁议会中拥有一个席位的概念。托尔多拉斯雇佣了乔拉什塔尔雇佣兵来帮助保护其在下层世界的殖民地，并且正在寻求扩大这支力量以推动新的攻势。",

While they held onto their ancestral lands, the Korth Edicts required Kundarak to sever its ties to the other clans, putting the interests of its clients ahead of those of the Mror. While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world. Kundarak helped bring dragonmarked services to the Mror Holds, and also helped build connections between houses and clans—House Deneith and the Droranath, House Jorasco and the Frosthaven clans. So while there was some estrangement, the clans generally accepted Kundarak's new role—though Soldorak has long decried Kundarak as abandoning traditional values and selling out the dwarves.": "但在巴尔-杜洛尔之后不久，昆达拉克家族成为昆达拉克家族，将其影响力扩大到整个霍尔韦尔。虽然他们守住了自己的祖传土地，但科思法令要求昆达拉克切断与其他部族的联系，将客户的利益放在了莫洛尔人的利益之上。虽然这造成了最初的紧张局势，但它也带来了大量的黄金和影响力，并成为封地和外部世界之间的桥梁。昆达拉克帮助将龙纹服务带到了摩尔领地，也帮助建立了家族和宗族之间的联系--迪尼斯家族和德洛拉那斯家族，乔拉斯科家族和弗罗斯特哈文宗族。因此，虽然有一些隔阂，但各部族普遍接受了昆达拉克的新角色--尽管索多拉克长期以来一直谴责昆达拉克放弃了传统的价值观并出卖了矮人。",

Should it choose to send expeditions below, it would do so with extreme care and caution.": "昆达拉克家族在铁议会中没有席位，也不被认为是摩尔家族的一员。昆达拉克已经尽力不参与地下战争，尽管在地下战争期间，昆达拉克的工程师在建造防御设施方面发挥了重要作用，并获得了丰厚的报酬。尽管有宝藏和过去的奥秘的诱惑，昆达拉克没有兴趣在其权力所在地的下面寻求灾难；它已经加强了其尖顶下的所有深层门户。如果它选择派遣探险队到下面，它将非常小心和谨慎。",

Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine—Korran's Maw—was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of House Kundarak and Zilargo, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.": "摩尔庄园有十二个庄园，包括昆达拉克家族--但故事中却有十三位流亡者。诺德伦很聪明，也很好奇，是个探险家，总是能发现新东西。诺德隆霍尔德从来不是一个大的部族，但它最大的矿场--科兰之口--是一个丰富的来源，可以提供一系列看似不可能的矿物，包括埃伯龙和凯伯龙碎片。这使得它成为昆达拉克家族和齐拉尔戈家族的强大盟友，并为该部族带来了巨大的财富。",
	"And then, approximately four hundred years ago, Noldrunhold fell silent. Messengers sent into the hold never returned. Noldrun had previously fought many fierce battles with the Jhorash'tar, and blame immediately fell to the orcs; but none could explain how the Jhorash'tar could have achieved such a massacre.": "然后，大约四百年前，Noldrunhold沉寂了。派往该地的信使从未回来。诺德隆之前与乔拉什塔尔人进行了许多激烈的战斗，责任立即落在了兽人身上；但没有人能够解释乔拉什塔尔人如何能够实现这样的屠杀。",
	"The fate of Noldrunhold remains a mystery to this day. Most contemporary records of what explorers found were passed down orally and are unreliable.

Neighboring clans Soldorak and Droranath both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned—again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The Droranath blame the Jhorash'tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of Jhorash'tar still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran's Maw.": "Nrunold的命运至今仍是一个谜。当代关于探险家所发现的大部分记录都是口口相传的，并不可靠。在一些记载中，尸体被剥皮了；在另一些记载中，没有尸体，好像诺德伦人都直接消失了。有些人认为诺德伦人都聚集在一起，下到了科兰的大口中；有些人说乔拉什塔尔人杀死了他们，并把尸体扔进了大口中。邻近的索尔多拉克和德洛拉纳特部族都试图向被遗弃的领土扩张，并要求获得空旷的尖顶，但所有的尝试都被放弃了--同样，关于原因的故事也是不可靠的。有人说新的定居者在非理性的狂热中自相残杀，也有人说他们只是消失了。德拉纳特人指责乔拉什塔尔兽人，而且神秘的是，乔拉什塔尔部落仍然生活在诺德伦的旧地上，尽管即使他们也回避空城和科兰之口。",
	"Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below—that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that's all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the Jhorash'tar after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal.": "今天，许多人认为诺德伦人一定是地下战争的第一批受害者--他们挖得太深，被迪尔恩摧毁。有些人认为在索尔乌达发现的德鲁人是诺德伦矮人的残余。但这都只是猜测。也许这是被囚禁在该地区的邪恶霸主所为。也许这是造成哀伤的早期影响，或者是某种坎尼斯的实验。或者，也许这毕竟是乔拉什塔尔人，而兽人拥有一些他们尚未揭示的隐藏力量。",
	"The Jhorash'tar are an alliance of orc tribes that have dwelt in the Ironroot Mountains since before the arrival of the dwarves. The Jhorash'tar have no written records, but their tales suggest they once held most of the Ironroots, and that many of their tribes were annihilated in the early days of the Exile. However, others suggest that the orcs might have been eradicated by the civilization that built Sol Udar. Indeed, the existence of the Face of Mror—a mountain sculpted to resemble a dwarf king, a feat of engineering far beyond the capabilities of the modern Mror—implies the dwarves of Sol Udar were active on the surface of the mountains at some point. Whatever the truth, by the time of Bal Dulor, the bulk of the Jhorash'tar had been pushed to the southwestern regions of the Ironroot Mountains, where they continued to clash with Clan Droranath and Clan Noldrun.": "乔拉什塔尔人是一个兽人部落联盟，在矮人到来之前就一直居住在铁根山脉。Jhorash'tar没有书面记录，但他们的故事表明他们曾经拥有铁根山脉的大部分地区，他们的许多部落在流放初期被消灭了。然而，也有人认为，兽人可能已经被建造索尔乌达的文明所消灭。事实上，\"摩尔之面 \"的存在--一座被雕刻成矮人国王模样的山，这一工程壮举远远超出了现代摩尔人的能力--暗示着索尔-乌达的矮人曾在某个时期在山的表面活动。不管事实如何，到了巴尔-杜洛尔时期，大部分乔拉什塔尔人已经被赶到了铁根山脉的西南部地区，在那里他们继续与德洛拉纳特家族和诺德伦家族发生冲突。",
	"The Jhorash'tar orcs have a distinct culture, with nothing in common with the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes or the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches. There are at least six distinct tribes, each split into smaller bands; the DM can add details to a particular tribe to suit the story. Some dwell on the surface of the mountains—often in caves along canyon walls—while others dwell underground, in the same layer the dwarves mined for centuries before breaking through into Sol Udar. The Jhorash'tar have never formed large communities, and usually split when a band has a hundred or more adult members, or whenever a bonecaster—their spiritual leader—advises it.": "乔拉什塔尔兽人有一种独特的文化，与恶魔荒原的加什卡拉兽人或阴影地带的守门人没有任何共同之处。至少有六个不同的部落，每个部落又分成更小的队伍；DM可以根据故事的需要增加某个部落的细节。有些部落居住在山脉的表面--通常是在峡谷壁上的洞穴中--而其他部落则居住在地下，与矮人在闯入索尔乌达之前开采了几个世纪的矿层相同。乔拉什塔尔人从未形成过大型社区，通常在一个乐队有一百个或更多成年成员时，或者在他们的精神领袖--bonecaster--提出建议时，才会分裂。",
	"The primary spiritual tradition of the Jhorash'tar is called the Path of Bones. Bonecasters are their priests and diviners. They can speak with the dead and temporarily conjure spirits to produce magical effects, but traditionally they don't create lasting undead. A player character following this path might be a cleric with the Grave domain, though the typical bonecaster doesn't have access to all the spells and features of a cleric. Bonesworn are elite champions strengthened by spirits; a player character following this path could be an Ancestral Guardian or Zealot barbarian. The Jhorash'tar believe that the ghosts of the fallen linger, and continue to guide the living through whispers and dreams. Tribes often decorate the entrances of their dwellings with the bones of their own fallen warriors, believing that the spirits of the fallen protect them.": "乔拉什塔尔人的主要精神传统被称为 \"骨头之路\"。造骨者是他们的祭司和占卜者。他们可以与死人对话，并暂时召唤灵魂以产生神奇的效果，但传统上他们不会创造持久的亡灵。走这条路的玩家角色可能是一个拥有坟墓领域的牧师，尽管典型的铸骨者并不能使用牧师的所有法术和功能。刺骨者是由灵魂强化的精英冠军；走这条路的玩家可以是一个祖先守护者或狂热者野蛮人。乔拉什塔尔人相信堕落者的鬼魂会一直存在，并继续通过耳语和梦境引导活人。部落经常用自己阵亡战士的骨头来装饰他们的住所入口，相信阵亡者的灵魂会保护他们。",
	"The Jhorash'tar don't work metal, though some are willing to use metal weapons and armor acquired from the Mror. Bonecaster rituals allow them to shape and harden bone, and they often incorporate bones in weapons and armor. While they often use the bones of large creatures, it's also common for one of the bonesworn to carry a weapon or token that incorporates an ancestor's bone. The Jhorash'tar also work with other natural materials, including wood and stone. They have no equivalent to heavy armor, but can combine bone and leather to create armor that offers similar protection to a breastplate or scale mail.": "乔拉什塔尔人不加工金属，尽管有些人愿意使用从姆罗尔人那里获得的金属武器和盔甲。铸骨者的仪式使他们能够塑造和硬化骨头，他们经常在武器和盔甲中融入骨头。虽然他们经常使用大型生物的骨头，但骨骸人中的一个人携带融合了祖先骨头的武器或信物也很常见。乔拉什塔尔人也使用其他天然材料，包括木材和石头。他们没有相当于重甲的东西，但可以将骨头和皮革结合起来，制造出与胸甲或鳞甲相似的保护性盔甲。",
	"Many of the Jhorash'tar tribes wish for peace with the dwarves, and are working with the Frosthaven clans to reach an understanding. For the most part, these tribes don't want to live alongside Mror in their cities, but wish for their own recognized lands, and want the right to gather the bones of other orcs from across the holds. However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn—but it's possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.": "许多乔拉什塔尔部落希望与矮人和平相处，并且正在与冰霜之城的部族合作以达成谅解。在大多数情况下，这些部落并不想在他们的城市中与摩尔并肩生活，而是希望拥有自己公认的土地，并希望有权收集整个地区的其他兽人的骨头。然而，也有一些部落渴望复仇，被他们死去的人的哭声所驱使。这些部落继续参与游击战，并尽可能地散布恐怖。据Moror所知，兽人没有与下层世界或Dyrrn的力量接触过，但也有可能某个部落被腐蚀者触动了，并可能出现不寻常的力量，甚至与反常者结盟。",
	"It's up to the DM whether the Jhorash'tar were involved in the destruction of Noldrunhold. Whatever the truth, Jhorash'tar tribes live safely in Noldrun territory, though they shun its cities.": "Jhorash'tar人是否参与了Noldrunhold的毁灭，这取决于DM。无论真相如何，Jhorash'tar部落安全地生活在Noldrun领地，尽管他们避开了它的城市。",
	"The people of the Five Nations only think of the world in terms of the things they've seen, the lands they can visit. Forests and farmland, valleys and hills. But there's another world a Brelish farmer can't even imagine, a land of wonders a league below the water's surface, lit by bioluminescence and cold fire. This is no empty wilderness. There are civilizations in the oceans, cultures older than even those of the giants of Xen'drik.": "五国人民只想到他们所见过的东西，他们可以访问的土地，这就是世界。森林和农田，山谷和山丘。但还有一个布雷利什农民无法想象的世界，一个在水面下的奇迹之地，由生物发光和冷火照亮。这不是空旷的荒野。海洋里有文明，甚至比Xen'drik的巨人的文化还要古老。",
	"Eberron is home to ten seas, as diverse as the continents of the world above. Each of the seas is home to powerful nations, deadly creatures, and hidden secrets. This section focuses on the Thunder Sea, beginning with an overview of the region and delving into the major cultures found there.": "Eberron是十个海洋的家园，就像上面的世界大陆一样多样化。每片海域都有强大的国家、致命的生物和隐藏的秘密。本节主要介绍雷霆之海，从该地区的概况开始，深入了解那里的主要文化。",
	"In general, there's little traffic between the people who dwell on land and those who live in the ocean depths. Just as a common Brelish farmer cares little about the ocean's denizens, a typical merfolk kelp-tender knows nothing of Breland and has no interest in the surface dwellers. But anyone who sails the Thunder Sea needs to know what—and who—lies below. The nations of the depths maintain their borders like any other nation, and someone who blunders into the Eternal Dominion without proper authorization faces sahuagin wrath. Most major port cities—including Sharn and Stormreach—host representatives of nearby aquatic nations, and envoys on the docks can help plan and authorize travel through their domains. As a result, most sailors know at least a little about the cultures of the waters they pass through, and every Lyrandar crew includes a \"sea speaker\" who knows Sahuagin and Aquan.": "一般来说，住在陆地上的人和住在海洋深处的人之间没有什么交流。就像一个普通的布莱里什农夫对海洋居民不感兴趣一样，一个典型的人鱼族的海带搬运工对布莱里什一无所知，对表面居民也不感兴趣。但是，任何在雷海航行的人都需要知道下面有什么，还有谁。深海中的国家像其他国家一样维持着自己的边界，如果有人在没有适当授权的情况下贸然进入永恒领地，将面临萨瓦金人的愤怒。大多数主要港口城市--包括沙恩和Stormreach--都有附近水生国家的代表，码头上的特使可以帮助计划和授权通过他们的领地旅行。因此，大多数水手至少对他们经过的水域的文化有一点了解，每个Lyrandar船员中都有一个了解萨瓦金和阿奎恩的 \"海上发言人\"。",
	"The Thunder Sea lies between Khorvaire, Xen'drik, and Aerenal. It takes its name from the unnatural storms that rage over some areas, never-ending tempests fueled by the elemental power of Lamannia. As dangerous as these waters are, this is a crucial crossroads for trade, and there's a constant stream of ships flowing between Sharn, Stormreach, and Pylas Talaer. It's here that the sahuagin first arose, the seat of their greatest civilization.": "雷海位于霍尔韦尔、Xen'drik和Aerenal之间。它的名字来自于在某些地区肆虐的非自然风暴，由拉曼尼亚的元素力量推动的无休止的暴风雨。尽管这些水域很危险，但这是一个重要的贸易十字路口，有源源不断的船只在沙恩、斯托姆雷奇和皮拉斯-塔拉尔之间流动。这里是萨瓦金人最早出现的地方，是他们最伟大的文明所在地。",
	"In the dawn of time, the Thunder Sea was the domain of the Lurker in Shadow. This overlord embodies the fear of the unknown, of the evil that could be lurking just beyond sight, and the fear that our friends could be secretly scheming against us. The Lurker created the aboleths, who conquered and dominated creatures of the deep—giants, dragons, and sahuagin. The struggle against the overlords played out beneath the water just as it did above. Dragons battled krakens and giants fought aboleths, while the sahuagin consumed the fallen on both sides. The wrath of the Lurker shattered the ocean floor. Dragons were impaled on spires of demonglass. But in time, the overlords were bound and the aboleths fled into the deepest abysses.": "在时间的黎明，雷海是阴影中的潜伏者的领域。这个霸主体现了对未知的恐惧，对可能潜伏在视线之外的邪恶的恐惧，以及对我们的朋友可能在暗中谋划反对我们的恐惧。潜伏者创造了aboleths，他们征服并支配着深海的生物--巨兽、龙和萨瓦金。对抗霸主的斗争在水底进行，就像在水面上进行一样。龙与克拉肯（Krakens）战斗，巨人与阿波利斯（Aboleths）战斗，而萨瓦金（sahuagin）吞噬了双方的死者。潜伏者的愤怒震碎了海底。龙被钉在恶魔玻璃的柱子上。但随着时间的推移，霸主们被束缚住了，阿波勒斯逃到了最深的深渊。",
	"Today, the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion are spread far and wide across the floor of the Thunder Sea. Their mightiest cities are built around—and {@i into}—massive slumbering creatures known as {@i kar'lassa}, \"great dreamers.\" The merfolk live in the upper waters above the sahuagin. Their permanent settlements are tied to manifest zones, and they perform rituals to contain the threat posed by these zones. The other major power in the Thunder Sea is the Valraean Protectorate, the domain of the sea elves. These elves laid claim to the waters around Aerenal, conquering the local sahuagin and other species, and bending them to their will. The Dominion sahuagin despise the Valraean elves, but thus far, the power of the Undying Court has repelled every assault.": "今天，永恒国度的萨瓦金人在雷海的地面上分布得很广。他们最强大的城市是围绕着--{@i into}--被称为{@i kar'lassa}，\"伟大的梦想家 \"的巨大的沉睡生物建造的。人鱼族生活在萨瓦金人以上的水域。他们的永久定居点与显灵区联系在一起，他们举行仪式来控制这些区域所带来的威胁。雷海的另一个主要力量是瓦拉恩保护国，这是海精灵的领地。这些精灵对艾瑞纳周围的水域提出了要求，征服了当地的萨瓦金人和其他物种，并使他们屈服于自己的意志。主导者萨瓦金人鄙视瓦拉恩精灵，但迄今为止，不死阁的力量已经击退了每一次攻击。",
	"What will bring your adventurers to the Thunder Sea? Will you delve into the depths to explore ruins built by long-dead giants? Will you negotiate with sahuagin and work to prevent a war between land and sea? Or will you struggle to survive after you're pulled down by the aboleths and the ancient evils that lurk in the ultimate darkness?": "什么会把你的冒险者带到雷海？你会深入到深处去探索由死去已久的巨人建造的遗迹吗？你会与萨瓦金人谈判，努力阻止陆地和海洋之间的战争吗？或者你会在被阿波利斯和潜伏在终极黑暗中的古老邪恶拉下水后挣扎求生？",
	"The Thunder Sea is a critical path for trade. Any traffic with Xen'drik crosses the Thunder Sea. In addition to the ships of House Lyrandar (both elemental galleons with dragonmarked captains and mundane ships licensed by the house), the Thunder Sea sees traffic from Aerenal, Zilargo, Breland, and Riedra. The most important ports include Pylas Maradal (Valenar), Pylas Talaer (Aerenal), Sharn (Breland), Stormreach (Xen'drik), Trolanport (Zilargo), Wyvernskull (Darguun), and Zarash'ak (Shadow Marches).": "雷海是贸易的关键路径。任何与Xen'drik的交通都要经过雷海。除了利兰达家族的船只（包括带有龙纹船长的元素大帆船和家族许可的世俗船只），雷海还有来自艾瑞纳、兹拉尔戈、布雷兰和里德拉的交通。最重要的港口包括Pylas Maradal（Valenar）、Pylas Talaer（Aerenal）、Sharn（Breland）、Stormreach（Xen'drik）、Trolanport（Zilargo）、Wyvernskull（Darguun）和Zarash'ak（Shadow Marches）。",
	"These major ports see both commercial, diplomatic, and military traffic. Aereni merchants carry shipments of exotic lumber, Riedran vessels are laden with crysteel and dragonshards, Lyrandar ships carry all manner of trade goods, and smugglers sneak barrels of kuryeva and tilxin blood into hidden coves. While the standard map of Khorvaire focuses on these major ports, there are also countless smaller ports and fishing villages scattered along the coastline.": "这些主要港口有商业、外交和军事往来。艾瑞尼（Aereni）商人运送异国木材，里德兰（Riedran）船只满载水晶和龙石，利兰达（Lyrandar）船只运送各种贸易货物，走私者将一桶桶库瑞瓦（Kuryeva）和提尔辛（Tilxin）的血液偷偷运进隐藏的海湾。虽然霍尔韦尔的标准地图集中在这些主要港口，但还有无数的小港口和渔村散布在海岸线上。",
	"The masters of the Thunder Sea—the sahuagin—don't want dryskins blundering through their territory. Traveling directly along the coastline is reasonably safe, and local fisherfolk don't need to negotiate with sahuagin every time they set sail; the sahuagin don't lay claim to the waters within 6 miles of Khorvaire's coast, and permit fishing an additional 20 miles beyond that. But crossing the Thunder Sea is an entirely different story. Setting aside the territorial claims of the sahuagin, the sea is filled with deadly hazards—endless storms, demonglass spires, and hungry monstrosities.": "雷霆之海的主人--萨瓦金人--不希望干巴巴的人在他们的领地上乱闯。直接沿着海岸线旅行是相当安全的，而且当地渔民不需要每次出海都与萨瓦金人交涉；萨瓦金人不对霍尔韦尔海岸6英里内的水域提出要求，并允许在此之外的20英里处捕鱼。但穿越雷霆海是一个完全不同的故事。撇开萨瓦金人的领土要求不谈，这片海域充满了致命的危险--无尽的风暴、恶魔玻璃尖顶和饥饿的怪兽。",
	"The Eternal Dominion has established specific routes that captains must follow, safe from hazards and monitored by the Dominion. Captains who wish to use these routes must obtain {@i beacons of passage}—common magic items that tell the sahuagin their travel is authorized, charged to last for a set time. Even with a {@i beacon}, there are places—such as Shargon's Teeth—where a wise captain pays for the services of a sahuagin or merfolk guide.": "永恒的统治者已经建立了特定的路线，船长们必须遵循，远离危险，并由统治者监控。希望使用这些路线的船长必须获得{@i beacons of passage}--普通的魔法物品，告诉萨瓦金人他们的旅行已被批准，并在规定的时间内充电。即使有了{@i beacon}，有些地方--比如沙贡之牙--明智的船长也会支付萨瓦金人或人鱼向导的服务费。",
	"Some brave (or foolish) souls deviate from these approved routes, whether desiring speed or avoiding the cost of local customs and the price of a {@i beacon}. The Thunder Sea is nearly the size of Khorvaire itself, and the sahuagin aren't everywhere; however, those regions shunned by the sahuagin and merfolk are usually avoided with good reason, and smugglers may face dangerous environmental hazards or hungry monstrosities.": "一些勇敢的（或愚蠢的）灵魂偏离了这些被认可的路线，无论是渴望速度还是避免当地习俗的代价和（%0%）的价格。雷霆之海的面积几乎相当于霍尔韦尔本身，萨瓦金人并非无处不在；然而，那些被萨瓦金人和人鱼族回避的地区通常被避开，理由很充分，走私者可能面临危险的环境危害或饥饿的怪兽。",
	"Venturing underwater can be a challenge for adventurers. They'll need assistance just to be able to breathe. Chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} presents additional rules for underwater adventures; swimming is exhausting, it's hard to see underwater, and many attacks suffer disadvantage. At the same time, it can seem as though things aren't limited enough. Shouldn't something strange happen when you generate lightning damage underwater? Shouldn't spells that deal cold damage freeze the water? And even if you can breathe underwater, if you go to the depths where the sahuagin are, thousands of feet under the surface, won't the pressure crush you?": "水下探险对冒险家来说是一个挑战。他们需要援助，只是为了能够呼吸。{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的第五章提出了水下冒险的额外规则；游泳很累，在水下很难看到，而且许多攻击都会受到不利影响。同时，看起来好像事情的限制还不够多。当你在水下产生雷电伤害时，难道不应该发生一些奇怪的事情吗？造成寒冷伤害的法术难道不应该冻结水面吗？即使你能在水下呼吸，如果你去萨瓦金人所在的深处，在水面下数千英尺，压力不会把你压垮吗？",
	"It's certainly possible to come up with more complicated rules that address all scientific concerns. But ultimately, the goal is to have a fantastic pulp adventure, not to realistically model a deep-sea dive. So it's okay to follow the rules in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} and not worry too much about the science—perhaps the magic allowing you to breathe underwater also protects you from changes in pressure.": "当然也可以想出更复杂的规则来解决所有的科学问题。但归根结底，我们的目标是进行一次奇妙的纸浆冒险，而不是真实地模拟一次深海潜水。因此，遵循（%0%）中的规则而不太担心科学问题也是可以的--也许让你在水下呼吸的魔法也能保护你不受压力变化的影响。",
	"{@adventure Ghosts of Saltmarsh|gos} also presents extensive options for running ocean adventures; many of these may offer inspiration as you build your undersea world. Regardless of the rules you decide to use, remember that the Thunder Sea isn't on Earth. In addition to the environmental effects of manifest zones, you have the aftereffects of conflict between giants, dragons, and archfiends. You have flora and fauna that don't exist on Earth, which have their own effects on the environment. A story should focus on creating an interesting, exciting environment to explore, even if it isn't a realistic match for true marine ecology.": "{@adventure Ghosts of Saltmarsh|gos}也为运行海洋冒险提供了广泛的选择；当你建立你的海底世界时，其中许多可能会提供灵感。无论你决定使用哪种规则，请记住，雷海并不在地球上。除了表现区的环境影响外，你还有巨人、龙和大恶魔之间冲突的后果。你有地球上不存在的植物和动物，它们对环境有自己的影响。一个故事应该专注于创造一个有趣的、令人兴奋的探索环境，即使它不是真正的海洋生态的现实匹配。",
	"The storms of the Thunder Sea are legendary. Beyond wind and rain, tales speak of maelstroms that drag down even the largest vessels and masses of vegetation that rise from the water to entangle ships. All of these are very real threats, even more so because these dangers don't obey simple laws of wind and water. The Thunder Sea is home to a wide range of manifest zones, but the most powerful and numerous are those tied to Lamannia. The endless fury of the First Storm lashes ships with lightning and storm winds, and great maelstroms can pull a ship down into the Endless Ocean. The vast masses of vegetation are tied to the Twilight Forest, fueling unnatural growth that can latch onto a vessel and trap it in the sargassum. Though the influence of Lamannia is most strongly felt here, it's also possible to find an unexpected region of icebergs surrounding a manifest zone tied to Risia, boiling waters around a Fernian zone, or a region tied to Mabar where the shadows of sailors turn on the living.": "雷海的风暴是传奇性的。除了风和雨，传说中的漩涡甚至可以拖垮最大的船只，大量的植被从水中升起，缠住船只。所有这些都是非常真实的威胁，甚至更多，因为这些危险并不服从简单的风和水的规律。雷海是各种显露区的家园，但最强大和最多的是那些与拉曼尼亚有关的显露区。第一风暴的无尽怒火用闪电和暴风抽打船只，巨大的漩涡可以将船只拉入无尽之海。大量的植被与暮色森林联系在一起，助长了非自然的生长，可以抓住船只并将其困在马尾藻中。虽然这里最能感受到拉曼尼亚的影响，但也有可能发现一个意外的冰山区域围绕着与里西亚相连的显影区，沸腾的水域围绕着费尼安区，或者一个与马巴尔相连的区域，水手们的影子转向了生活。",
	"As any skilled ocean navigator can tell you, manifest zones are stable, physical locations. While a manifest zone's influence extends beyond its focal point, the worst storms of the Thunder Sea remain confined to specific areas. However, when the plane linked to a manifest zone is coterminous, its impact is dramatically enhanced, with storms extending beyond their usual radius and becoming far more powerful. This is why knowledge of the sea is vitally important for sailors; if you venture off the approved trade routes, you need to chart a course that will avoid the storms.": "正如任何熟练的海洋导航员可以告诉你的那样，显影区是稳定的物理位置。虽然显影区的影响超出了它的焦点，但雷海最严重的风暴仍然局限于特定区域。然而，当与显露区相连的平面是同向的，它的影响就会大大增强，风暴会超出其通常的半径，变得更加强大。这就是为什么对海洋的了解对水手来说是至关重要的；如果你冒险离开被批准的贸易路线，你需要制定一个可以避免风暴的路线。",
	"Lamannian manifest zones often release elementals into Eberron. An eternal storm may contain air elementals, while water elementals can be found in the region around a maelstrom. Such elementals aren't intentionally cruel, but they're driven to express their elemental drives—which often makes them dangerous to ships, which they perceive as alien invaders. Manifest zones can also produce dire beasts—octopi, sharks, and other creatures of remarkable size.": "拉曼人的显灵区经常向伊伯伦释放元素。一个永恒的风暴可能包含空气元素，而水元素则可以在大漩涡周围的区域找到。这样的元素并不刻意残忍，但它们被驱使着去表达它们的元素驱动力--这往往使它们对船只感到危险，因为它们认为这些船只是外来的入侵者。表现区也可以产生可怕的野兽--八爪鱼、鲨鱼和其他体型惊人的生物。",
	"The merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed in more detail later in this section) serve as planar shepherds, tending manifest zones and helping to contain and mitigate their effects. This isn't absolute; the merfolk can't entirely disperse the power of the First Storm, or stop the growth of the Twilight Forest. But they seek to direct it, choosing to vent its power at times when there is minimal danger to innocents. Even when a region has especially bad storms due to a manifest zone, those storms could be far, far worse if the merfolk stopped performing their rituals or were driven away entirely.": "雷海的人鱼族（在本节后面会详细讨论）作为平面牧羊人，照看显化区，帮助遏制和减轻它们的影响。这不是绝对的；人鱼族不能完全驱散第一风暴的力量，也不能阻止暮色森林的生长。但他们试图引导它，选择在对无辜者的危险最小的时候宣泄其力量。即使当一个地区因显灵区而出现特别糟糕的风暴时，如果人鱼族停止举行仪式或完全被赶走，这些风暴可能会糟糕得多、多。",
	"Throughout the sea, vast spires of stone and coral rise up from the bottom of the ocean—in some cases, over a mile in height. Some reach the surface, while other clusters lie hundreds of feet below it. While these spires formed naturally, they're often interspersed with a more dangerous—and unnatural—substance. {@i Demonglass} is similar to obsidian, but virtually indestructible. These demonglass spires—commonly called \"needle teeth\"—can pierce the hull of a swiftly moving ship despite being just a few inches in width. The spires in this region were created by the Lurker in Shadow during the First War (though it wasn't responsible for the demonglass found elsewhere in Eberron, such as Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes).": "在整个海洋中，巨大的石头和珊瑚尖顶从海底升起--有些情况下，高度超过1英里。有些达到了海面，而其他集群则位于海面以下数百英尺。虽然这些尖顶是自然形成的，但它们往往夹杂着一种更危险的、非自然的物质。{@i Demonglass}与黑曜石相似，但几乎是不可摧毁的。这些恶魔玻璃尖顶--通常被称为 \"针齿\"--尽管只有几英寸宽，却能刺穿迅速移动的船体。这个地区的尖顶是由阴影中的潜伏者在第一次战争期间创造的（尽管它并不负责在Eberron的其他地方发现的恶魔玻璃，例如恶魔荒原的阿斯塔卡拉）。",
	"The region known as Shargon's Teeth—a Common adaptation of the Sahuagin name for the Devourer—lies directly between Sharn and Stormreach, and is the most infamous manifestation of these hazardous needle teeth. Stone spires and demonglass spikes of all sizes are scattered between this chain of islands. Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a course through the Teeth without the help of a sahuagin guide; as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers and pirates, preying on ships that founder on the Teeth.": "被称为 \"沙刚之牙 \"的地区--由萨瓦金人对吞噬者的称呼改编而成--直接位于沙恩和风暴地带之间，是这些危险针牙最臭名昭著的表现。大大小小的石质尖塔和恶魔玻璃尖刺散落在这一连串的岛屿之间。只有最老练的航海家才能在没有萨瓦金人向导的帮助下规划出一条穿越针齿的路线；因此，这些岛屿长期以来一直是走私者和海盗的天堂，他们捕食在针齿上创建的船只。",
	"Throughout the Thunder Sea, needle teeth are a dangerous hazard for those who stray from the established trade routes—but they also provide an opportunity to interact with creatures of the sea. Any number of aquatic monstrosities may make a lair in the upper reaches of a spire. The sahuagin also often colonize the larger teeth, carving tunnels throughout a spire. High teeth thus serve as outposts projecting up to the upper waters where light can reach, allowing travelers to visit a sahuagin outpost without having to descend to the absolute depths.": "在整个雷霆之海，对于那些偏离既定贸易路线的人来说，针齿是一种危险的危险，但它们也提供了一个与海洋生物互动的机会。任何数量的水生怪兽都可能在尖塔的上游筑起巢穴。萨瓦金人也经常在较大的牙齿上定居，在整个尖顶上开凿隧道。因此，高牙作为前哨站投射到光线可以到达的上层水域，使旅行者可以访问萨瓦金人的前哨站，而不必下到绝对的深处。",
	"The greatest wonders of the Thunder Sea lie deep below the surface, all but unknown to the people of Khorvaire. The kar'lassa are enormous beasts—miles in length—half-buried and sleeping in the floor of the Thunder Sea. Not even the dragons of Argonnessen know the origin of the kar'lassa. They've slept since the beginning of recorded history, and are immune to all forms of divination magic. They could be creations of Khyber trapped before they could rise to the surface, or they could've been crafted by Eberron to guard against some future threat. Perhaps they are young progenitors, and when they finally wake, they will create new worlds.": "雷霆海最伟大的奇迹深藏在地表之下，但却不为霍尔韦尔的人们所知。卡拉萨是巨大的野兽--长达数英里--半埋在雷海的地面上沉睡。甚至连阿贡纳森的龙都不知道卡拉萨的起源。它们从有记载的历史开始就一直在沉睡，而且对所有形式的占卜魔法都免疫。他们可能是开伯尔的创造物，在上升到地表之前就被困住了，也可能是艾伯伦为了防范未来的威胁而制作的。也许他们是年轻的祖先，当他们最终醒来时，他们将创造新的世界。",
	"All that's known for certain is that the kar'lassa are massive, immortal monstrosities... and that each is bound to one of the planes. Each kar'lassa radiates the effects of a powerful manifest zone, extending up to 13 miles. The appearance of each kar'lassa reflects the plane they're tied to; the kar'lassa of Shavarath is a massive draconic beast with steel scales, while the kar'lassa of Fernia is a serpent of embers, water forever boiling against its skin. But the strangest aspect of the kar'lassa is their dreams. As described in chapter 5, when mortals dream, their spirits are usually drawn into Dal Quor. However, when the kar'lassa dream, {@i they don't dream in Dal Quor}. Instead, each kar'lassa dreams in the plane it's tied to—and more wondrous yet, each great dreamer draws in the spirits of dreaming mortals. Any creature that dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa—including unwary sailors passing above, if any are bold enough to go off the approved travel routes—is pulled into the behemoth's dream, instead of dreaming in Dal Quor. So, for example, anyone who sleeps in the Dominion city of Hal'iri dreams their dreams in Irian. While dreaming in this way, a creature is only present as a spirit, and is immune to the negative environmental effects of that plane; so a mortal dreamer isn't hurt by the extreme heat of Fernia or the cold of Risia. Even if a dreamer dies in their dream from other causes, they just wake up. This is still {@i dreaming}; unless the dreamer is capable of lucid dreaming, they have little control of their actions and will likely only remember fragments of the experience. But if they do have tools or training that allow lucid dreaming (as with the {@i uul'kur} in chapter 7), this can be an interesting way to explore the planes.": "所有可以确定的是，卡拉萨是巨大的、不朽的怪物......而且每个人都被束缚在一个平面上。每个卡尔拉萨都散发着强大的显灵区的影响，延伸至13英里。每个卡尔拉萨的外观都反映了它们所隶属的位面；沙瓦拉斯的卡尔拉萨是一个巨大的带有钢鳞的龙兽，而费尔尼亚的卡尔拉萨则是一条火蛇，水在它的皮肤上永远沸腾。但卡拉萨最奇怪的地方是他们的梦。正如第五章所述，当凡人做梦时，他们的精神通常被吸引到达尔-库尔。然而，当卡尔拉萨人做梦时，（%0%）。相反，每个卡拉萨都会在它所处的位面做梦--更奇妙的是，每个伟大的梦想家都会把做梦的凡人的灵魂吸引过来。任何在kar'lassa周围13英里范围内做梦的生物--包括在上面经过的不知情的水手，如果有任何胆大妄为的人偏离了批准的旅行路线--都会被拉进巨兽的梦中，而不是在Dal Quor做梦。因此，举例来说，任何在多米尼克城市Hal'iri睡觉的人都会在伊里安做梦。当以这种方式做梦时，一个生物只是作为一个精神存在，并且对该平面的负面环境影响免疫；所以一个凡人梦者不会被费尔尼亚的极热或里西亚的寒冷所伤害。即使梦者在梦中因其他原因死亡，他们也只是醒过来。这仍然是{@i dreaming}；除非做梦者有能力做清醒的梦，否则他们几乎无法控制自己的行为，很可能只记得经历的片段。但如果他们有工具或训练，可以做清醒的梦（如第七章的（%2%）），这可能是探索平面的一种有趣方式。",
	"When the dar dream, they are drawn to the Uul Dhakaan, the shared dream of the empire—but when anyone dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa, they're drawn into its dream. So what happens if a golin'dar dreams near a kar'lassa? These ancient primordial forces trump the work of Jhazaal Dhakaan, and the dar are pulled into the dream of the kar'lassa instead of to Dal Quor. However, all of the dream-tools crafted by the Kech Dhakaan—the {@i kra'uul} and {@i uul'kur}—function normally within the dream of a kar'lassa.": "当达尔人做梦时，他们被吸引到Uul Dhakaan，即帝国的共同梦想--但当任何人在卡拉萨的13英里范围内做梦时，他们就会被吸引到它的梦中。那么，如果一个Golin'dar在kar'lassa附近做梦会怎样？这些古老的原始力量战胜了Jhazaal Dhakaan的工作，dar被拉入kar'lassa的梦中，而不是拉到Dal Quor。然而，所有由Kech Dhakaan制作的梦境工具--{@i kra'uul}和{@i uul'kur}--在kar'lassa的梦境中正常运作。",
	"What about kalashtar? Their connection to Dal Quor has been completely severed, but they do dream; when a kalashtar sleeps, they create dreams within their own mind, drawing on their memories and their quori spirit. However, if kalashtar find themselves within the range of a kar'lassa, they're pulled into its dream, as with the dar.": "那么卡拉什塔人呢？他们与达尔-库尔的联系已被完全切断，但他们确实在做梦；当卡拉什塔人睡觉时，他们在自己的头脑中创造梦境，利用他们的记忆和他们的库尔精神。然而，如果卡拉什塔人发现自己在一个卡拉萨的范围内，他们就会被拉入它的梦境，就像达尔一样。",
	"The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are aware of how the kar'lassa influence the dreams of \"lesser\" races. Though the Protectorate hasn't yet captured any Dominion cities, they take great pride in their belief that because they don't sleep, they would be above the influence of the kar'lassa—but this belief is wrong! It's true that elves trance rather than sleep, entering a deep meditative state much like a lucid dream, self-directed and untouched by the influence of either Dal Quor or a kalashtar's quori spirit. However, this process is physiologically similar to a human's dreams and can likewise be hijacked by the kar'lassa—which would be a startling experience for an elf who's never dreamed before!": "Valraean保护国的海精灵们知道kar'lassa是如何影响 \"小 \"种族的梦境的。虽然保护国还没有占领过任何统治者的城市，但他们对自己的信念感到非常自豪，因为他们不睡觉，所以他们不会受到卡拉萨的影响--但这种信念是错误的! 诚然，精灵们是恍惚而非睡眠，进入一种深沉的冥想状态，很像一个清醒的梦，自我引导，不受达尔-库尔或卡拉什塔的库里精神的影响。然而，这个过程在生理上与人类的梦境相似，同样可以被卡拉萨劫持--这对一个从未做过梦的精灵来说将是一个惊人的经历！\"。",
	"Twelve kar'lassa have been discovered; one for each plane, aside from Dal Quor. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion have built their largest cities around eight of these great dreamers, though they've shunned the kar'lassa associated with Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the kar'lassa, and these substances are the fuel that drives their industry.": "已经发现了12个卡尔拉萨；除了达尔-库尔之外，每个平面都有一个卡尔拉萨。永恒领地的萨瓦金人围绕着这些伟大的梦想家中的八个建立了他们最大的城市，尽管他们避开了与马巴尔、Xoriat、Thelanis和Risia有关的卡拉萨。萨瓦金人从卡尔拉萨身上采集生物物质，这些物质是驱动他们工业的燃料。",
	"The kar'lassa are a source of wonder, not monsters to be fought. To all tests, they appear to be immortal, and regenerate damage quickly. Spells such as {@spell stone to flesh} or {@spell disintegrate} only work on a tiny sliver of the kar'lassa, and even that's quickly restored. If one of these ancient slumbering monstrosities were to rise, it would be an almost unstoppable force of destruction, and destroy the Dominion city in the process. If one of these vast creatures emerged onto land, it could easily devastate cities without even meaning to.": "卡尔拉萨是一个奇迹的来源，而不是要与之战斗的怪物。在所有的测试中，他们似乎是不死之身，并能迅速再生伤害。诸如{@spell stone to flesh}或{@spell disintegrate}的法术只对卡拉萨的一小部分起作用，即使是这样也会很快恢复。如果这些古老的沉睡的怪兽中的一个上升，它将是一个几乎不可阻挡的破坏力量，并在这个过程中摧毁多米尼克城。如果这些庞大的生物中的一个出现在陆地上，它可以轻易地破坏城市，甚至没有意义。",
	"Titanic, unstoppable monstrosities that could threaten entire cities? That sounds a little like the tarrasque. And indeed, a simple way to introduce the tarrasque into Eberron is to present it as a kar'lassa rising from its slumber and threatening Sharn or Stormreach; just add the effects of a manifest zone to the region around it. The tarrasque is small for a kar'lassa; most are miles long, large enough that the sahuagin build cities around them. But it's possible a small kar'lassa might be the first to wake—can the heroes who oppose it find a way to return it to its slumber before the others wake? If a DM chooses to explore this plotline, they'll have to decide the truth about the origins of the kar'lassa. If they're the children of Eberron, they might not want to destroy innocent creatures; they could have an important purpose as yet unfulfilled. On the other hand, if they're tools of the overlords or the Devourer, their rising will spell disaster.": "泰坦尼克号，不可阻挡的怪兽，可以威胁到整个城市？这听起来有点像塔拉斯克。事实上，将塔拉斯克引入Eberron的一个简单方法是将它呈现为一个从沉睡中苏醒并威胁着沙恩或Stormreach的卡拉萨；只需在它周围的区域添加一个宣言区的效果。对卡拉萨来说，塔拉斯克很小；大多数卡拉萨都有数英里长，大到萨瓦金人可以在其周围建造城市。但有可能一个小的卡拉萨会是第一个醒来的--反对它的英雄们能否在其他的卡拉萨醒来之前找到让它恢复沉睡的方法？如果DM选择探索这条情节线，他们就必须决定关于卡拉萨的起源的真相。如果他们是Eberron的孩子，他们可能不想毁灭无辜的生物；他们可能有一个尚未完成的重要目的。另一方面，如果他们是霸主或吞噬者的工具，他们的崛起将带来灾难。",
	"The Thunder Sea is home to the ancient evil of the aboleths, who yearn to dominate the minds of all creatures. It holds the sleeping kar'lassa, who could devastate cities or nations if they rose from slumber. Where do the krakens fit in this hierarchy?": "雷海是古代邪恶的阿波利斯人的家园，他们渴望主宰所有生物的思想。它拥有沉睡的卡拉萨（kar'lassa），如果他们从沉睡中醒来，就会对城市或国家造成破坏。克拉肯人在这个等级制度中的地位如何？",
	"Krakens are children of Khyber, born in the Age of Demons. Unlike the aboleths, they weren't created by a fiendish overlord and they don't serve any overlord; each kraken is a power in its own right. Krakens enjoy exercising their power and being worshipped by lesser creatures, and each one carved out a domain within the chaos of the Age of Demons. The binding of the overlords didn't adversely affect the krakens; however, many feared that the alliance that had formed to defeat the fiends might well turn its attention to them next, so they chose to go into hiding and sleep, waiting for an age when the champions of the Age of Demons were dead and the oceans were free.": "克拉肯是开伯尔的孩子，诞生于恶魔时代。与阿波利斯人不同，他们不是由邪恶的霸主创造的，他们也不为任何霸主服务；每个克拉肯都是自己的力量。克拉肯喜欢行使它们的权力，并被较小的生物所崇拜，每个人都在恶魔时代的混乱中划出一个领域。霸主的束缚并没有对克拉肯产生不利影响；然而，许多人担心，为击败魔族而组成的联盟很可能会在接下来将注意力转向他们，所以他们选择躲起来睡觉，等待恶魔时代的冠军们死去，海洋自由的时代到来。",
	"Krakens are spread across all of the oceans of Khorvaire. For the most part, they don't work together, in part to avoid the interest of Argonnessen. One kraken dominating an island of humanoids is of no concern to the dragons; an alliance of krakens is another story. However, multiple krakens have occasionally joined forces. Tens of thousands of years ago, five krakens devastated the previous civilization of the sahuagin of the Thunder Sea. Despite their power, they were eventually overcome; their remains are preserved in the city of Hal'shavar.": "克拉肯人分布在霍尔韦尔的所有大洋上。在大多数情况下，他们不在一起工作，部分原因是为了避免引起阿贡纳森的兴趣。一个克拉肯人统治着一个人形岛屿，对龙族来说并不重要；而一个克拉肯人的联盟则是另一回事。然而，多个克拉肯人偶尔也会联合起来。数万年前，五只克拉肯摧毁了雷海的萨瓦金人的先前文明。尽管他们很强大，但最终还是被战胜了；他们的遗体被保存在哈尔沙瓦城中。",
	"There are a few krakens in the Thunder Sea, but they avoid the Eternal Dominion, dwelling either in its fringes or in dangerous places that are shunned by the sahuagin. The kraken Bastyreth has established a sanctum below the kar'lassa tied to Mabar; it's raising a legion of undead minions and preparing to take vengeance on the Dominion.": "雷海中有一些克拉肯，但它们避开了永恒领地，要么住在它的边缘，要么住在萨瓦金人避之不及的危险地方。克拉肯-巴斯蒂尔斯（Bastyreth）在与马巴尔相连的卡尔拉萨（kar'lassa）下面建立了一个圣地；它正在养育一个不死的奴仆军团，准备向统治者复仇。",
	"The Thunder Sea is vast and ancient. The sahuagin call their civilization the Eternal Dominion, but in truth, it's risen and fallen multiple times. The Lurker, as well, has nearly risen several times, and aboleths have set the sea devils against one another in vicious civil wars. There are a handful of storm giants in the depths, but any nation they once possessed was destroyed long ago. Remnants of these conflicts are spread across the Thunder Sea. Explorers could find an ancient temple haunted by the ghosts of the storm giants that built it, an overgrown sahuagin fortress from a previous age of the Dominion, or the tomb of a dragon sealed tens of thousands of years ago.": "雷海是广阔而古老的。萨瓦金人称他们的文明为 \"永恒的主宰\"，但事实上，它已经兴起和衰落了多次。潜伏者（Lurker）也几乎崛起了好几次，阿波勒斯（Aboleths）让海魔在恶性内战中互相对抗。深海中还有少数风暴巨人，但他们曾经拥有的任何国家都在很久以前被摧毁。这些冲突的残余物遍布雷海。探险者可能会发现一座被建造它的风暴巨人的鬼魂所困扰的古老神庙，一个多米尼克时代的杂草丛生的萨瓦金堡垒，或者一个数万年前被封印的龙的坟墓。",
	"Most dangerous of all are the deepest abysses, strongholds of the surviving servants of the Lurker in Shadow. These cracks in the ocean floor might hold mighty artifacts forged during the Age of Demons, but they're home to aboleths, fiends, and even more terrifying creatures.": "最危险的是最深的深渊，这是阴影中潜伏者幸存的仆人的据点。这些海底的裂缝中可能藏有恶魔时代铸造的强大神器，但它们是阿波利斯人、恶魔和更可怕的生物的家。",
	"When dealing with the Thunder Sea, remember that it's just as civilized as the Five Nations. It does have wilderness regions with feral beasts roaming at will, and you might find wild plesiosaurs, a scheming sea hag, or a hungry scrag. But in the areas above and around sahuagin city-states, such beasts have been tamed or destroyed. All cultures of the Thunder Sea farm fish like the people of the land farm sheep or cattle; a pod of whales may be carefully managed and cultivated, and their farmers will be quite angry with dryskins who poach their ichthyic livestock. There are sharks—and giant sharks—in the wild waters, but in the civilized zones, the sahuagin use them much as humans use hounds. Dragon turtles serve different roles depending where they're found; in the Dominion, dragon turtles are forced to serve as beasts of burden and living engines of war, while the merfolk form alliances with dragon turtles and consider them partners in a community.": "在与雷海打交道时，请记住，它和五国一样是文明的。它确实有荒野地区，有野性的野兽在随意游荡，你可能会发现野生的plesiosaurs，一个诡计多端的海巫师，或者一个饥饿的scrag。但在萨瓦金城邦的上方和周围地区，这种野兽已经被驯服或摧毁。雷海的所有文化都在养鱼，就像陆地上的人在养羊或养牛一样；一群鲸鱼可能被精心管理和培养，他们的农民会对偷猎他们的鱼类牲畜的干皮相当生气。野生水域有鲨鱼，而且是巨鲨，但在文明区，萨瓦金人使用它们就像人类使用猎犬一样。龙龟在不同的地方扮演着不同的角色；在统治区，龙龟被迫作为负担的野兽和战争的活引擎，而人鱼族则与龙龟结成联盟，认为它们是社区中的伙伴。",

Sahuagin storm priests tell the common tale of how gods and demons fought in the first age, but their story doesn't end with the binding of the overlords. Once the fiends were defeated, the Sovereigns were determined to take their place and rule as tyrants. The sahuagin Sha'argon was a bold hunter and mighty warrior. He stalked the Sovereigns of the natural world, Arra'ai and Ba'alor. Sha'argon trapped them and consumed them, claiming their power as his own. The other Sovereigns were angry, but none could outwit Sha'argon, and he already had the power of two gods; so they fled to the world above and beyond, and to this day, they flee when the mighty hunter draws near.": "暴风城的任何水手都可以告诉你，萨瓦金人崇拜吞噬者，他们称之为沙冈。但这只是故事的一部分。萨瓦金人的风暴祭司讲述了第一个时代中神与魔的斗争的普通故事，但他们的故事并没有随着霸主的约束而结束。一旦魔族被打败，君主们就决心取而代之，作为暴君进行统治。萨瓦金人Sha'argon是一个大胆的猎手和强大的战士。他盯上了自然界的主宰者，阿拉艾和巴洛尔。Sha'argon困住了他们并吞噬了他们，将他们的力量据为己有。其他君主很生气，但没有人能够智取沙康，而且他已经拥有两个神的力量；所以他们逃到了地上和外面的世界，直到今天，当这个强大的猎人靠近时，他们也会逃跑。",
	"Sha'argon is the greatest of the gods. He sets the laws of the world, and they are cruel. Life is an endless struggle. The weak will perish in the storm or be consumed by the mighty. Those with cunning and courage can conquer the world itself, and the victor has the right to devour their vanquished foe. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion take these messages to heart. There is no foe they cannot conquer, no power they cannot claim.

	"If the Dominion wished to conquer the surface world, it could do so easily—or so the sahuagin say. But to what end? Dryskins are pathetic barbarians, weak in both body and mind. The Eternal Dominion seeks grander prey, power worthy of Sha'argon. Some seek to consume the overlords; others plan the conquest of worlds beyond the world. Is this pure arrogance? Or can the Eternal Dominion gain mastery over reality itself?": "如果多米尼克想征服地表世界，它可以很容易地做到--或者萨瓦金人是这么说的。但是为了什么目的呢？旱地人是可怜的野蛮人，身体和心灵都很脆弱。永恒的统治者寻求的是更大的猎物，是配得上Sha'argon的力量。有些人寻求吞噬霸主；有些人计划征服世界之外的世界。这是纯粹的傲慢吗？还是永恒的统治者能够获得对现实本身的控制权？",
	"The sahuagin dwell on the floor of the Thunder Sea. They possess an uncanny ability to rapidly adapt to changing pressure, and can ascend from the depths to the surface with no ill effects.

From the moment they emerge from the spawning pools, young sahuagin undergo a regimen of diet, mystic rituals, and training that shapes them for their intended purpose. Sahuagin aren't clones, but a sahuagin warrior is imbued with strength and fury, and a sahuagin assassin is swift and deadly—each by design. The sahuagin {@i create} their sorcerers. All Dominion sahuagin go through this initial process of shaping, and those who prove themselves worthy can go farther still, undergoing the rituals that produce champions such as the four-armed barons and the malenti. But these are just two examples of what the sahuagin magebreeders can achieve. The Claws of Sha'argon—presented in chapter 8—are another example of these magebred champions.": "人类学者知道萨瓦金 \"突变体 \"的存在，但很少有人意识到这些不是随机的突变；他们是一个系统的最明显的产物，这个系统涉及到多米尼克的每一个萨瓦金人。从他们从产卵池里出来的那一刻起，年轻的萨瓦金人就接受了饮食、神秘仪式和训练的养生之道，以塑造他们的预期目的。萨瓦金人不是克隆人，但萨瓦金人的战士被赋予了力量和愤怒，而萨瓦金人的刺客则是迅速而致命的--每一个都是经过设计的。萨瓦金人（%0%）他们的巫师。所有Dominion的萨瓦金人都要经历这个最初的塑造过程，而那些证明自己有价值的人可以走得更远，经历产生冠军的仪式，如四臂男爵和马伦蒂。但这只是萨瓦金魔力培育者能够实现的两个例子。第8章中介绍的 \"沙氩之爪 \"是这些魔法培育的冠军的另一个例子。",
	"What do sahuagin eat? Whatever they want, and often, whoever they want. Sahuagin are voracious omnivores who demonstrate their mastery over things by consuming them. Food brings great pleasure to the sahuagin, and they take pride both in the preparation of food and in the diversity of their diet; they farm both fish and flora, and hunt creatures that can't be farmed. Eating a locathah servant can either be an act of punishment or a great honor, depending on how the meal is prepared and consumed. Like the gnolls of the Znir Pact, it's common for a sahuagin to eat at least part of a fallen enemy, though this is more to seal the victory than to honor the spirit; you haven't truly defeated someone until you've consumed them. With this concept in mind, a DM may wish to give sahuagin NPCs advantage on saving throws against any sort of ingested poison and resistance to poison damage from such poisons.": "萨瓦金人吃什么？他们想吃什么就吃什么，而且往往是想吃谁就吃谁。萨瓦金人是贪婪的杂食者，他们通过吃东西来证明自己对事物的掌握。食物给萨瓦金人带来了极大的乐趣，他们对食物的准备和饮食的多样性都感到自豪；他们既养殖鱼类和植物，也猎杀无法养殖的生物。吃一个locathah的仆人既可以是一种惩罚行为，也可以是一种巨大的荣誉，这取决于这顿饭是如何准备和食用的。就像兹尼尔盟约的地精一样，萨瓦金人通常会吃掉倒下的敌人的至少一部分，尽管这更多的是为了巩固胜利而不是为了尊重精神；在你吃掉他们之前，你还没有真正打败某人。考虑到这一概念，管理员可能希望让萨瓦金人的NPC在面对任何种类的摄取的毒物时都有优势，并对这种毒物的伤害有抵抗力。",

	"Sahuagin culture is deeply aggressive; in any situation, they look to see how they can win. This combines with a deep sense of cultural unity; what matters isn't that I defeat the foe, it's that {@i we} defeat it. So while sahuagin frequently compete with other sahuagin, seeking to advance in rank and earn evolution into a higher form, this is about strengthening the Dominion, not simply personal pride. Sahuagin don't seek to cheat their way into positions they believe they don't deserve. Similarly, weakness can't be tolerated, and they spare no time on sentimentality. The sahuagin are children of the Devourer: the point of storm and sickness is to cleanse weakness and strengthen those who survive. Anyone who grows too old or infirm should be challenged by those below them—but this is rare in practice, for a sahuagin who realizes they can no longer perform their role will usually abdicate before they're challenged. It's common practice for a respected retiring leader to be consumed by their subordinates, so their spirit and skills will remain part of the Dominion. The sahuagin warrior who has grown too old to serve has no regrets about being consumed; they lived well, and now they give what strength they have left to nourish those who will come after them. A single life is fleeting; the Dominion is eternal, and your spirit lives on in your comrades who consume you. On the other hand, those seen as having no value—who are best excised from the Dominion—will simply be fed to the sharks.": "萨瓦金文化具有很强的攻击性；在任何情况下，他们都要看自己如何才能获胜。这与深刻的文化团结意识相结合；重要的不是我打败了敌人，而是（%0%）打败了敌人。因此，虽然萨瓦金人经常与其他萨瓦金人竞争，寻求提升等级并赢得进化到更高的形式，但这是为了加强统治，而不仅仅是个人的骄傲。萨瓦金人不会寻求欺骗他们的方式进入他们认为不值得的位置。同样地，不能容忍软弱，他们不遗余力地进行感性分析。萨瓦金人是吞噬者的孩子：风暴和疾病的意义在于清洗弱点，加强那些幸存的人。任何太老或太弱的人都应该受到下面人的挑战--但这在实践中很少见，因为意识到自己不能再履行职责的萨瓦金人通常会在受到挑战之前退位。通常的做法是，一个受人尊敬的退休领导人会被他们的下属所吞噬，这样他们的精神和技能就会继续成为统治者的一部分。已经老得不能再老的萨瓦金战士对被吞噬并不感到遗憾；他们活得很好，现在他们把自己剩下的力量用来滋养那些将在他们之后的人。一个人的生命是转瞬即逝的；统治者是永恒的，你的精神在吞噬你的战友中继续存在。另一方面，那些被视为没有价值的人--他们最好从主宰中剔除--将被简单地喂给鲨鱼。",
	"Stemming from this, the people of the Eternal Dominion are extremely industrious. Sahuagin never relax, and don't understand why anyone would—if you stop moving, you're dead. They're always looking for something to do, a challenge to overcome. However, this leaves them little time for abstract reflection, romance, or whimsy; life is war, and there's no time for poetry. Some would also say this limits innovation, and the Dominion is indeed slow to change its methods. Sahuagin are austere in their needs and desires, and don't seek comfort, luxury, or personal wealth. This isn't to say the sahuagin don't enjoy life or seek entertainment—but rather, what drives the sahuagin is victory. They don't care for music or theater, but they enjoy gladiatorial combat and other forms of aggressive sport, such as public debates and arcane duels. They also love to eat, as this is a symbolic victory over whatever they're eating. Symbols of all kinds are important in sahuagin culture. Their armor, weapons, and architecture are designed to intimidate enemies and show off one's rank and status.": "源于此，永恒国度的人民非常勤奋。萨瓦金人从不放松，也不明白为什么有人会放松--如果你停止行动，你就死定了。他们总是在寻找一些事情做，寻找一个可以克服的挑战。然而，这使他们几乎没有时间进行抽象的思考、浪漫或异想天开；生活就是战争，没有时间去写诗。有些人还会说这限制了创新，而多米尼克确实在改变其方法方面很缓慢。萨瓦金人的需求和欲望都很简朴，不追求舒适、奢华或个人财富。这并不是说萨瓦金人不享受生活或寻求娱乐--而是说，驱动萨瓦金人的是胜利。他们不关心音乐或戏剧，但他们喜欢角斗士的战斗和其他形式的侵略性运动，如公开辩论和神秘的决斗。他们也喜欢吃东西，因为这是对他们所吃的东西的象征性胜利。各种各样的符号在萨瓦金文化中都很重要。他们的盔甲、武器和建筑都是为了恐吓敌人，炫耀自己的等级和地位。",
	"Sahuagin have no families nor concept of personal property. Your loyalty is to your city, and then to the Dominion as a whole. You were born in the spawning pools of your city and assigned a purpose and a {@i shiver}—the group of sahuagin you trained with as a child, to whom you may have a personal attachment. From there, you worked your way up to prove your value and earn a higher rank. All positions are based on merit; while the title of a military leader is often translated as \"baron,\" the position is earned, not inherited. The city gives you equipment and lodging based on your position, though you can earn trophy items through sporting victories. Sahuagin always look for ways to prove themselves and earn advancement, but never at the expense of your shiver, your city, or the Dominion. Sahuagin find criminal behavior and those who betray their people for personal gain to be repulsive, a sign of an inferior species.','The society of the Eternal Dominion is split into three primary forces:": "萨瓦金人没有家庭，也没有个人财产的概念。你的忠诚是对你的城市，然后是对整个统治者。你出生在你的城市的产卵池中，并被分配了一个目的和一个{@i shiver}--你小时候训练的萨瓦金人团体，你可能对他们有个人感情。从那里开始，你努力向上证明你的价值并获得更高的等级。所有的职位都是基于功绩；虽然军事领导人的头衔通常被翻译为 \"男爵\"，但这个职位是赢得的，而不是继承的。城市根据你的职位给你提供装备和住宿，尽管你可以通过体育比赛的胜利来获得奖杯物品。萨瓦金人总是想方设法证明自己，赢得进步，但决不是以牺牲你的颤抖、你的城市或统治者为代价。萨瓦金人认为犯罪行为和那些为了个人利益而背叛他们的人是令人厌恶的，是劣等物种的标志。",
	"The {@b Ra'har} (\"body\") is the military. The sahuagin view life as conflict, and are zealous about maintaining a strong military. When there is no active conflict, they engage in war games and engage in gladiatorial combat—both locally, and in a league against the other cities—to entertain the people.": "{@b Ra'har}（\"身体\"）是军队。萨瓦金人将生活视为冲突，并热衷于维持一支强大的军队。当没有积极的冲突时，他们会进行战争游戏，并参与角斗士的战斗--无论是在本地，还是在与其他城市的联盟中，以娱乐人民。",
	"The {@b Ta'har} (\"mind\") are the scholars, scientists, and priests—which, among the sahuagin, are all branches of a single path. Alchemy and sorcery are core sciences in the Dominion. The sahuagin recognize divine magic as a resource, and excel at the aggressive cultivation of the faith required to channel it. Ta'har scholars advise the Ra'har, using the lessons of history to drive military strategy, while Ta'har artificers work with the Su'har to maintain the infrastructure of the cities.": "{@b Ta'har}（\"心灵\"）是学者、科学家和牧师--在萨瓦金人中，他们都是一条道路的分支。炼金术和巫术是统治者的核心科学。萨瓦金人认识到神圣的魔法是一种资源，并擅长于积极培养引导它所需的信仰。Ta'har学者为Ra'har提供建议，用历史的教训来推动军事战略，而Ta'har工匠则与Su'har合作，维护城市的基础设施。",
	"The {@b Su'har} (\"heart\") maintain the civic infrastructure. They maintain and expand the cities, ensure the steady flow of supplies, and organize the spawning pools and the education and evolution of the young. The Ta'har develop new techniques, but it's the Su'har who turn the wheels of industry.": "{@b Su'har}（\"心脏\"）维护公民的基础设施。他们维护和扩大城市，确保供应的稳定流动，组织产卵池和年轻人的教育和进化。Ta'har开发新技术，但Su'har才是转动工业车轮的人。",
	"Each city is governed by a {@i Sha'rei}—Council of Three—with a leader from each force. Councilors add the prefix \"kar\" to their force, so the {@i Kar'ra'har} is the military leader of a sahuagin city. Cities coordinate through the {@i Sha'lassa}—Council of Dreams—as described in the \"Harvesting the Dreamers\" section. The priesthood of the Eternal Dominion follows one of two paths. The {@i razh'ash}—storm priests—are devoted to Sha'argon, and serve as the primary spiritual guides of the people. They teach the harsh lessons of the Devourer, while also wielding his might in battle when needed. The second path is that of the {@i lass'ash}, \"dream priests\"; their work is important and they support the Su'har, but they don't preach to the people.": "每个城市都由一个{@i Sha'rei}--三人理事会管理，每个势力都有一个领导人。议员们在他们的部队上加上 \"kar \"的前缀，所以{@i Kar'ra'har}是萨瓦金城市的军事领袖。城市通过{@i Sha'lassa}--梦想理事会进行协调，如 \"收获梦想者 \"部分所述。永恒统治者的神职遵循两条道路中的一条。{@i razh'ash}--风暴祭司--献身于沙阿贡，并作为人民的主要精神向导。他们传授吞噬者的严厉教训，同时在需要时在战斗中挥舞他的力量。第二条道路是{@i lass'ash}，\"梦想祭司\"；他们的工作很重要，他们支持Su'har，但他们不向人民传教。",
	"The Eternal Dominion claims the entirety of the Thunder Sea as its territory, and maintains outposts across the sea, often carved into stone spires that rise up to the surface. However, most of their population is concentrated in the great cities of the Dominion. These lie on the seafloor, thousands of feet below the surface, far beyond the reach of sunlight—yet illuminated by sahuagin-engineered bioluminescent coral. Each city is named after the kar'lassa it's built around, and the kar'lassa in turn are in turn named for the plane they're bound to.": "永恒的统治者声称整个雷海是其领土，并在海面上保持着前哨站，通常被雕刻成石制尖顶，耸立在海面上。然而，他们的大部分人口都集中在统治者的伟大城市。这些城市位于海底，在海面以下数千英尺，远离阳光的照射，但却被萨瓦金人设计的生物发光珊瑚所照亮。每座城市都以其周围的卡拉萨命名，而卡拉萨又以其所绑定的飞机命名。",
	"The city of Hal'daan is the administrative heart of the Dominion. Here, the leaders of the Su'har develop the civic models used throughout the Dominion. This city also holds the bureaucratic archives of the Dominion.": "Hal'daan市是多米尼克的行政中心。在这里，Su'har的领导人制定了整个国家的公民模式。这座城市还保存着多米尼克国的官僚档案。",
	"The smallest of the great cities, Hal'dol is a center for necromantic research. The skulls of great leaders and priests from across the Dominion are preserved in the Bone Library, where sahuagin mediums can use speak with dead to consult with them.": "Hal'dol是最小的大城市，是死灵研究的中心。来自整个王国的伟大领袖和牧师的头骨被保存在骨头图书馆里，萨瓦金人的灵媒可以利用与死者对话来咨询他们。",
	" This region has an abundance of geothermal vents, and due to Fernia's influence, it's also a source of pure elemental flame that burns underwater. Hal'fer is an industrial center working with heat and steam; it's the primary source of metal goods, and mints the currency used with surface dwellers.": " 这个地区有大量的地热喷口，由于费尔尼亚的影响，它也是一个在水下燃烧的纯元素火焰的来源。Hal'fer是一个利用热量和蒸汽工作的工业中心；它是金属制品的主要来源，并铸造了地面居民使用的货币。",
	"This is a stronghold of the Ta'har, driving mystical research and holding the largest temples in the Dominion—both in reality and in the kar'lassa's dream. Many priests train in Hal'iri, and its people have grand dreams of what the Dominion can become. It's a center for exploring lofty goals, such as defeating the Valraean Protectorate, consuming the overlords to gain their power, and perhaps even conquering the planes (as discussed in the \"Story Hooks\" section).": "这里是Ta'har的一个据点，推动着神秘的研究，并拥有全域最大的寺庙--无论是在现实中还是在kar'lassa的梦中。许多牧师在Hal'iri受训，这里的人们对多米尼克能成为什么样的国家有着宏伟的梦想。它是一个探索崇高目标的中心，比如击败瓦拉恩保护国，吞噬霸主以获得他们的力量，甚至可能征服各个星球（正如在 \"故事钩子 \"部分所讨论的）。",
	" The influence of Kythri supports magic tied to change and transmutation, and these are vital to the society of the Dominion. Hal'kyth is the heart of the alchemical industry. While all great cities harvest the blood of the kar'lassa (as discussed in the next section), it is Hal'kyth that has the greatest capacity for refining it. Though the Dominion is slow to innovate, the artificers of Hal'kyth are an exception, and they continue to develop new techniques; the plasmids discussed in chapter 8 were first magebred in Hal'kyth.": " Kythri的影响支持与变化和转化相关的魔法，而这些对多米尼克的社会至关重要。Hal'kyth是炼金业的核心。虽然所有伟大的城市都在收获卡尔拉萨的血液（正如下一节所讨论的），但只有哈尔凯斯有最大的能力来提炼它。虽然多米尼克创新缓慢，但Hal'kyth的工匠是个例外，他们继续开发新技术；第八章中讨论的质粒是在Hal'kyth首次培育的。",
	"The flora and fauna of this region are unnaturally fertile. Hal'laman is a center for all forms of animal husbandry, and also holds the largest spawning pools of the Dominion. When Lamannia is coterminous, growth rates spike dramatically; it's always a struggle to keep the city safe during these times, with aggressive beasts swept into frenzies and vegetation becoming shambling mounds.": "这个地区的植物和动物都是非自然的肥沃。Hal'laman是各种形式的畜牧业中心，也拥有全域最大的产卵池。当拉曼尼亚同城化时，增长速度急剧飙升；在这些时候，要保证城市的安全总是很费劲，好斗的野兽被卷进狂热中，植被变成摇摇欲坠的土堆。",
	"This is the military seat of the Dominion, where the finest barons and strategists are trained. Here, the Ra'har of Hal'shavar establish the military traditions used throughout the Dominion. Mock battles and other grand spectacles are carried out in the grand arena of Hal'shavar.": "这里是多米尼克的军事基地，最优秀的男爵和战略家都在这里接受训练。在这里，哈尔沙瓦的拉哈尔人建立了整个国家的军事传统。在哈尔沙瓦的大竞技场上进行模拟战斗和其他盛大的表演。",
	" This is the center for commerce and trade with other cultures. Hal'syra even has a rarely-used quadrant enchanted so surface dwellers can breathe within it. This city is the source of the ambassadors, envoys, and merchants who deal with surface dwellers and other cultures, and it's here that the scholars of the Ta'har study surface dwellers and debate the best ways to deal with them.": " 这里是与其他文化进行商业和贸易的中心。Hal'syra甚至有一个很少使用的象限，使地表居民可以在其中呼吸。这座城市是与地表居民和其他文化打交道的大使、特使和商人的来源地，塔哈尔的学者们也在这里研究地表居民，讨论与他们打交道的最佳方式。",
	"These major cities are each home to hundreds of thousands of sahuagin, and the total population of the Dominion is well into the millions. Farms and other small communities scattered between the great cities are often largely inhabited by locathah, with a core group of sahuagin overlords. In between, there are large stretches with no humanoid population; here, ruins of the giants and remnants of other fallen civilizations might be found.": "这些主要城市都是几十万萨瓦金人的家，而多米尼克的总人口远远超过了数百万。散布在大城市之间的农场和其他小社区通常主要由Locathah居住，并有一群核心的萨瓦金人统治者。在两者之间，有大片没有人烟的地方；在这里，可能会发现巨人的遗迹和其他堕落文明的残余。",
	"The eight greatest cities of the Eternal Dominion are built around kar'lassa, each tied to a different plane. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the slumbering behemoths, and this is the driving fuel of the Eternal Dominion. Pipelines channel the blood of the beasts, and workers dig muscle and bone out of mines carved into their flesh. The eldritch energies sustaining the kar'lassa regenerate damage at a remarkable rate; the Dominion has been harvesting them for over a thousand years, and so far, they haven't come close to taxing these resources.": "永恒统治者的八个最伟大的城市都是围绕着kar'lassa建立的，每个城市都与一个不同的平面相连。萨瓦金人从沉睡的巨兽身上采集生物物质，这也是永恒统治者的动力燃料。管道输送着巨兽的血液，工人们从刻在巨兽肉体上的矿井中挖出肌肉和骨骼。维持卡尔拉萨的长生能量以惊人的速度再生损害；主宰者已经收获了一千多年，到目前为止，他们还没有接近对这些资源的消耗。",
	"All biomatter from the kar'lassa is infused with arcane energy, and the sahuagin use these substances in the same way the Five Nations rely on dragonshards. In addition, the biomatter of each kar'lassa has unique properties and potential due to the plane it's tied to. The scales of Hal'shavar can be forged into powerful armor and weapons. The steam-breath of Hal'fer is an extremely powerful catalyst for evocation magic. The blood of Hal'kyth is an exceptional conduit for transmutation. These are just a few examples of the potential of the kar'lassa, and the Dominion itself is still discovering new uses for these resources. The Five Nations have never had an opportunity to work with this biomatter and know nothing of the kar'lassa. If a group of adventurers recovered a significant amount of biomatter—or secured a trade deal with the Dominion—House Cannith could produce strange new wonders.": "所有来自kar'lassa的生物物质都被注入了奥术能量，萨瓦金人使用这些物质的方式就像五国人依赖龙鳞一样。此外，由于所处的位面不同，每个卡尔拉萨的生物物质都有独特的属性和潜力。哈尔沙瓦的鳞片可以被锻造成强大的盔甲和武器。Hal'fer的蒸汽呼吸是一种极其强大的唤起魔法的催化剂。Hal'kyth的血液是一种特殊的转化渠道。这些只是卡尔拉萨潜力的几个例子，而多米尼克本身仍在发现这些资源的新用途。五国从未有机会与这种生物物质打交道，而且对卡拉萨一无所知。如果一群冒险家回收了大量的生物物质--或者与多米尼克达成贸易协议--坎尼斯家族就能产生新的奇怪的奇迹。",
	"So the kar'lassa are priceless resources and sources of power for the sahuagin; their biomatter drives Dominion industry, and cities benefit from the effects of their manifest zones. Only eight of the twelve kar'lassa have cities built around them, due to the dangers of the manifest zones extending from the kar'lassa tied to Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. But even in the cities of the \"safer\" kar'lassa, the sahuagin pay a price for the power they've harnessed. When the people of these cities sleep, their spirits are drawn into the dream of the local kar'lassa—a vast alien dream that takes place in its bound plane, rather than Dal Quor. Most sahuagin aren't lucid dreamers, and don't remember their dreams with any more accuracy than most humans do. But this experience has a notable impact on the personality and aptitudes of the people of each city; the people of Hal'shavar are the most aggressive of the sahuagin, while the people of Hal'syra are the most conciliatory.": "因此，kar'lassa是sahuagin的无价资源和力量源泉；它们的生物物质驱动着Dominion的工业，而城市则受益于它们的显现区的影响。12个卡拉萨中只有8个在其周围建立了城市，因为显露区的危险性从卡拉萨延伸到马巴尔、Xoriat、Thelanis和Risia。但即使在 \"更安全 \"的卡拉萨的城市，萨瓦金人也要为他们掌握的力量付出代价。当这些城市的人睡觉时，他们的精神被卷入当地卡拉萨的梦境中--一个巨大的异域梦境，发生在它的边界平面，而不是达尔奎尔。大多数萨瓦金人不是清醒的梦者，他们对梦境的记忆并不比大多数人类更准确。但这种经历对每个城市的人的个性和能力有明显的影响；Hal'shavar的人是sahuagin中最有攻击性的，而Hal'syra的人则是最和善的。",
	"The lass'ash—the \"dream priests\"—are an arm of the Ta'har devoted to the kar'lassa of their cities. These priests treat the kar'lassa both as divine beings and as servants; they believe that it's their rituals and devotions that keep the dreamers safely asleep, allowing the Dominion to continue to harvest their biomatter. At the heart of each temple lies the Or'lassa, the First Dreamer—a sahuagin priest sustained by direct infusions of kar'lassa blood. These infusions cause physical mutations that often reflect the shape of the kar'lassa and the plane it is tied to, as well as keep the First Dreamer in a comatose state. Their spirit permanently resides in the kar'lassa dream, where they anchor a temple formed from their pure will. Dream priests are trained in lucid dreaming, and they use these temples as a base both for planar research and to maintain communication across the Dominion. While they reside in different planes, the temples are mystically linked through the kar'lassa, and rituals allow the priests to spiritually travel between the dream-temples, carrying messages to the other cities. And it's in the dream of Hal'iri that the spirits of the Or'lassa meet to coordinate the actions of the Dominion; this is the {@i Sha'lassa}, the Council of Dreams.": "lass'ash--\"梦境祭司\"--是Ta'har的一个部门，专门负责他们城市的kar'lassa。这些祭司既把kar'lassa当作神圣的生命，也当作仆人；他们相信，正是他们的仪式和奉献让做梦的人安全入睡，让统治者能够继续收获他们的生物物质。在每个寺庙的中心，都有奥拉萨，即第一梦想家--一个通过直接注入卡拉萨血液维持生命的萨瓦金人牧师。这些注入的血液会导致身体变异，通常反映出卡尔拉萨的形状和它所联系的平面，并使第一梦想者处于昏迷状态。他们的精神永久地居住在kar'lassa的梦中，在那里他们固定着一个由他们纯粹的意志形成的神庙。梦的祭司接受过清醒梦境的训练，他们把这些神庙作为一个基地，用于平面研究和保持整个统治区的沟通。虽然他们居住在不同的平面，但这些寺庙通过kar'lassa有神秘的联系，仪式允许祭司们在梦中的寺庙之间进行精神旅行，将信息传递给其他城市。而正是在哈尔伊里的梦境中，奥拉萨的灵魂们会聚在一起，协调多米尼克的行动；这就是{@i Sha'lassa}，梦境议会。",
	"The Eternal Dominion is an advanced civilization that employs both arcane and divine magic as part of everyday life. It's generally more sophisticated than the Five Nations, but less advanced than Aerenal. Though the Dominion possesses capabilities beyond the Five Nations, its approaches can vary dramatically; for example, while the Dominion could generate {@spell continual flame}, light is largely provided by engineered bioluminescent coral. While the sahuagin employ all schools of magic—generally influenced by the resources of that city's kar'lassa—the Dominion's greatest advances are in alchemy, transmutation, and magebreeding.": "永恒统治者是一个先进的文明，在日常生活中同时使用奥术和神术。它通常比五国更复杂，但不如Aerenal先进。虽然多米尼克拥有超越五国的能力，但它的方法会有很大的不同；例如，虽然多米尼克可以产生（%0%），但光线主要是由工程生物发光珊瑚提供的。虽然萨瓦金人使用所有的魔法流派--通常受到该城市kar'lassa资源的影响--但多米尼克的最大进步是在炼金术、转化术和魔法繁殖方面。",
	"The Dominion has an exceptional talent for producing potions, allowing Dominion forces to temporarily boost their capabilities. But their technologies go far beyond temporary alterations, as the Dominion specializes in magebreeding all manner of creatures. The sahuagin themselves are carefully engineered to excel at the tasks chosen for them. In particular, the Dominion creates magewrights and sorcerers. This process isn't quick, taking place over the course of a sahuagin childhood, and including training as well as ongoing rituals and an unusual diet. The blood of the kar'lassa is used as a transformative catalyst, combined with the sahuagin principle, \"If you consume a thing you gain its power.\" As a result, creating a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer requires a young sahuagin to consume the flesh of a dragon—so there's a concrete limit on how many of these sorcerers the sahuagin can create.": "多米尼克有生产药水的特殊才能，允许多米尼克部队暂时提高他们的能力。但他们的技术远远超出了临时改变的范围，因为多米尼克擅长用魔法培育各种生物。sahuagin本身是经过精心设计的，以便在为他们选择的任务中表现出色。特别是，主宰者创造了魔法师和巫师。这个过程不是一蹴而就的，需要在萨瓦金人的童年时期进行，包括训练以及持续的仪式和不寻常的饮食。卡拉萨的血液被用作转化催化剂，结合萨瓦金人的原则，\"如果你吃了一个东西，你就会获得它的力量。\" 因此，创造一个龙族血统的巫师需要一个年轻的萨瓦金人吃掉一条龙的肉，所以萨瓦金人能够创造多少这样的巫师是有具体限制的。",
	"In addition to these basic techniques that guide the evolution of a young sahuagin, the Dominion can also induce dramatic secondary mutations; many sahuagin are highly motivated by this prospect of attaining a higher form. The malenti and the four-armed barons are the best known of these, but they represent just a fraction of the Dominion's magebreeding abilities, and the DM can create additional mutants to suit the story. For example, the Claw of Sha'argon (presented in chapter 8) possesses a secondary mutation that's granted to powerful priests. These forms of ascension require rare resources and a significant amount of kar'lassa blood (drawn from a particular dreamer based on the type of transformation sought), and are only granted to sahuagin who prove themselves worthy.": "除了这些指导年轻萨瓦金人进化的基本技术外，多米尼克还可以诱发戏剧性的二次变异；许多萨瓦金人被这种获得更高形态的前景所激励。马伦蒂和四臂男爵是其中最著名的，但他们只是多米尼克的魔法繁殖能力的一小部分，DM可以创造更多的变异体来适应故事。例如，\"沙氩之爪\"（在第8章中介绍）拥有一种次级变异，被授予强大的牧师。这些形式的提升需要稀有的资源和大量的卡尔拉萨血（根据所寻求的变异类型从特定的梦者身上提取），并且只授予那些证明自己有资格的萨瓦金人。",
	"In addition to altering themselves, the sahuagin put many enhanced beasts to good use. Enhanced mantas are a common mount, possessing a swim speed of 90 feet. Mutated giant sharks and eels are used as larger vehicles, sometimes with seating areas formed upon their backs, other times with bony handles protruding from the beast's hide, allowing multiple riders to cling to the side. In place of warships, the Dominion fields dragon turtles with siege staffs embedded into their shells. The sahuagin have also created entirely new forms of life. The alchemists of Hal'kyth used the blood and biomatter of the kar'lassa to create plasmids: protean creatures similar to mimics, but capable of replicating the texture of inanimate objects as well as shape. Plasmids can be guards—often serving as living doors to secure chambers—but they're also a useful tool of industry, as a trained plasmid can itself become the tools a sahuagin artisan needs to perform its work.": "除了改变自己之外，萨瓦金人还将许多强化的野兽派上用场。增强的螳螂是一种常见的坐骑，拥有90英尺的游泳速度。变异的巨鲨和鳗鱼被用作更大的交通工具，有时在它们的背上形成座位区，有时在兽皮上突出骨质把手，使多个骑手可以紧靠在旁边。作为战舰的替代品，多米尼克的龙龟将攻城杖嵌入其壳内。萨瓦金人还创造了全新的生命形式。Hal'kyth的炼金术士用kar'lassa的血液和生物物质创造了质体：类似于模仿者的蛋白体生物，但能够复制无生命物体的纹理和形状。质体可以成为守卫--通常作为安全房间的活门，但它们也是一种有用的工业工具，因为经过训练的质体本身可以成为萨瓦金工匠完成工作所需的工具。",
	"Skilled Dominion magewrights can cast {@spell fabricate} as a ritual, shaping raw materials into their desired form through magic. The Dominion also uses a substance called {@i korlass} (\"dream stone\"), formed from dreamer biomass, as an industrial material; it can be sculpted like clay, then fixed in its shape by a magewright ritual. {@i Korlass} has the strength of steel, with a texture similar to shell, though its appearance varies depending on which kar'lassa it's drawn from.": "熟练的Dominion魔法师可以将{@spell fabricate}作为一种仪式，通过魔法将原材料塑造成他们想要的形状。多米尼克还使用一种叫做{@i korlass}（\"梦石\"）的物质，由梦者的生物质形成，作为一种工业材料；它可以像粘土一样被雕刻，然后通过魔法师的仪式固定在其形状。{@i Korlass}具有钢铁的强度，质地类似于贝壳，尽管它的外观因从哪个卡拉萨提取而不同。",
	"When considering the abilities of Dominion sahuagin, it's likely that storm priests are Tempest clerics or Conquest paladins, while dream priests are Knowledge clerics. Sahuagin artificers are usually Alchemists, and the most common forms of arcane spellcasters are sorcerers (either Storm Sorcery or Draconic Bloodline) and magewrights. Sahaugin warriors are typically Battle Masters or Champions, but some embrace the blood frenzy of barbarians. Bards, druids, wizards, and warlocks aren't supported by the traditions of the Dominion and are rarely encountered.": "在考虑Dominion sahuagin的能力时，风暴牧师很可能是暴风雨牧师或征服圣骑士，而梦想牧师是知识牧师。萨哈金人的工匠通常是炼金术士，而最常见的奥术施法者形式是巫师（风暴巫术或龙族血统）和魔法师。萨哈金战士通常是战斗大师或冠军，但也有一些拥抱野蛮人的血腥狂热。吟游诗人、德鲁伊、巫师和术士不受多米尼克传统的支持，很少遇到。",
	"\"Dominion\" isn't just a title; the sahuagin dominate other creatures, from other aquatic humanoids to mighty dragon turtles. Before the rise of the Eternal Dominion, there were six locathah nations spread across the Thunder Sea; in the last thousand years, these have all been conquered and assimilated by the Dominion. Locathah laborers are now found in all of the great cities, and there are farming communities across the seafloor where locathah are ruled by sahuagin overseers.": "\"统治者 \"不仅仅是一个头衔，萨瓦金人还统治着其他生物，从其他水生类人到强大的龙龟。在永恒主宰崛起之前，有六个Locathah国家分布在雷海；在过去的一千年里，这些国家都被主宰征服和同化了。现在，所有的大城市都有Locathah的劳工，整个海底都有Locathah的农业社区，由sahuagin的监督者统治。",
	"The locathah are the most widespread subjects of the Dominion, but other creatures have been forced into servitude as well. The sahuagin of Hal'laman may have merfolk subjects. There could be a small population of subjugated koalinth near the coast of Darguun, or a city where there are still a few storm giants compelled into service. Typically, creatures that are Dominion subjects know the Sahuagin language, either instead of Common, or in addition to it (if they have regular contact with dryskins).": "locathah是统治者最广泛的臣民，但其他生物也被迫成为奴仆。哈尔拉曼的萨瓦金（sahuagin）可能有人鱼的臣民。在达尔古恩的海岸附近可能有一小部分被征服的考林斯人，或者在一个城市里还有一些被强迫服役的风暴巨兽。通常情况下，作为统治者的臣民的生物都知道萨瓦金语，或者代替普通话，或者在普通话之外（如果他们经常与干皮接触）。",
	"The Kalamer merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed later in this section) have largely been allowed to remain independent, as long as they continue to serve the needs of the Dominion. The Kalamer provide a valuable service, containing the impact of dangerous manifest zones and serving as intermediaries between the Dominion and the Valraean Protectorate.": "雷海的卡拉默人鱼族（在本节后面讨论）基本上被允许保持独立，只要他们继续为多米尼克的需要服务。卡拉默人提供了有价值的服务，他们控制着危险的流形区的影响，并作为多米尼克和瓦拉恩保护国之间的中间人。",
	"The people of the Five Nations know little about the Eternal Dominion. Ambassadors and envoys have visited Hal'syra, so there are stories drifting around that the sahuagin city is built around a massive, mysterious creature. This experience and the occasional clashes when people have challenged the territorial demands of the Dominion have taught the Five Nations and the houses to respect the Dominion, but they still know almost nothing about it, aside from the fact that they worship the Devourer. The Aereni have greater knowledge of the Dominion, and have seen its power in the long conflict with the Valraean Protectorate. They know about the kar'lassa, but because of the ongoing conflict, haven't actually explored its lands or visited its cities. So any adventurers who venture into the Dominion are pioneers, exploring unknown realms; academic institutions and dragonmarked houses alike will surely want to hear about their exploits.": "五国人民对 \"永恒的主宰 \"知之甚少。大使和特使曾访问过Hal'syra，所以有一些故事流传着，说这个萨瓦金城市是围绕着一个巨大的、神秘的生物建立的。这种经历以及人们挑战统治者的领土要求时偶尔发生的冲突，使五国和各家族学会了尊重统治者，但他们除了崇拜吞噬者外，对统治者仍然几乎一无所知。艾瑞尼人对多米尼克有更多的了解，并在与瓦拉恩保护国的长期冲突中看到了它的力量。他们知道卡尔拉萨，但由于持续的冲突，还没有真正探索过它的土地或访问过它的城市。因此，任何冒险进入多米尼克的冒险者都是先驱者，探索未知的领域；学术机构和龙纹屋都一定会想听听他们的探索经历。",
	"For their part, the sahuagin have little interest in the affairs of the dryskins. At this time, the Dominion has no interest in conquering the surface world, and they don't believe the dryskins pose any threat to their rule of the sea. However, the proud sahuagin don't want surface-dwellers bumbling through their territory or polluting their waters. They enforce their territorial waters as a show of strength, demanding that travelers pay tolls and follow the established trade routes.": "就他们而言，萨瓦金人对干皮人的事务兴趣不大。目前，多米尼克没有兴趣征服地表世界，他们不认为干皮会对他们的海洋统治构成任何威胁。然而，骄傲的萨瓦金人不希望地表居民在他们的领土上乱闯，或污染他们的水域。他们为了显示自己的实力，强制要求旅行者支付通行费并遵循既定的贸易路线。",
	"The Dominion remained neutral in the Last War. Trade between the sea and the surface has been limited, but has expanded in recent years. In particular, Merrix d'Cannith has discovered that the sahuagin have a surplus of Siberys shards; the shards fall into the ocean, but the Dominion economy is based on the blood of the kar'lassa as opposed to dragonshards, and they have little use for them. As such, the Dominion has much to offer Cannith, and securing a steady supply of Siberys shards would strengthen Merrix's position within his house. The trick is finding something the Dominion wants in return, and he's currently pursuing this. Merrix (and other dryskins) are as yet unaware of the vast resources of the kar'lassa; if they were discovered, and Cannith found a way to harness them, it could change the face of industry in Khorvaire.": "多米尼克在上次战争中保持中立。海洋和地面之间的贸易一直很有限，但近年来有所扩大。特别是，梅里克斯-坎尼斯（Merrix d'Cannith）发现，萨瓦金人有过剩的西伯利亚碎片；这些碎片落入海洋，但多米尼克的经济是基于卡拉萨人的血液，而不是龙碎片，他们对这些碎片没有什么用处。因此，多米尼克有很多东西可以提供给坎尼斯，而获得稳定的西伯利亚碎片供应将加强梅里克斯在他家的地位。诀窍是找到多米尼克想要的东西作为回报，而他目前正在追求这个目标。梅里克斯（和其他干皮）还没有意识到卡尔拉萨的巨大资源；如果它们被发现，而坎尼斯找到了利用它们的方法，它可能会改变霍尔韦尔的工业面貌。",
	"The Dominion despises the sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate, and in the past, they've launched full-scale campaigns against them, but the power of the Undying Court has thus far repelled all assaults. Currently, it's a stalemate; the Protectorate can't expand beyond the Undying Court's sphere of influence (as discussed later in this section), and the Dominion can't drive them back.": "主导者鄙视Valraean保护国的海精灵，在过去，他们对他们发动了全面的战役，但到目前为止，不死阁的力量击退了所有的攻击。目前，这是一个僵局；保护国无法扩张到不朽之庭的势力范围之外（正如本节后面所讨论的），而统治国也无法将其赶回。",
	"The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion aren't driven by the desire for gold that draws many humans to the path of adventure. Most are fiercely devoted to the Dominion—but what if your duty to the Dominion requires you to venture onto dry land? Perhaps you need to negotiate with the dryskins. Maybe you're seeking information on a force that's meddling with the Dominion—is it House Cannith or the Lords of Dust? Perhaps you're pursuing your peoples' goal of consuming an overlord or conquering the planes. Maybe you've been sent to study the dryskins themselves, to decide whether they're worth conquering. Or you might just be an exile or a rebel, a rare outlier who opposes the ambitions and actions of your people.": "永恒领地的萨瓦金人并不像许多人类那样被对黄金的渴望所驱使而走上冒险的道路。大多数人对统治者有强烈的奉献精神，但如果你对统治者的责任要求你到干地去冒险呢？也许你需要与旱地人进行谈判。也许你在寻找关于干涉统治者的势力的信息--是坎尼斯家族还是尘土领主？也许你在追求你的人民的目标，即吞噬一个霸主或征服各个星球。也许你被派来研究干尸本身，以决定他们是否值得征服。或者你可能只是一个流亡者或反叛者，一个反对你的人民的野心和行动的罕见的异类。",
	"While this book doesn't include racial traits for sahuagin, you can use the {@race locathah|LR} traits from {@book Locathah Rising|LR} (available on the Dungeon Masters Guild), and simply describe the character as a sahuagin. The Blood Frenzy trait of sahuagin NPCs is a special feature magebred into sahuagin soldiers, and not possessed by the general population (though you could represent this trait by playing a sahuagin barbarian).": "虽然本书没有包括萨瓦金人的种族特征，但你可以使用{@book Locathah Rising|LR}中的{@race locathah|LR}特征（可在地下城主协会中找到），并简单地将角色描述为萨瓦金人。萨瓦金NPC的 \"血之狂热 \"特质是萨瓦金士兵的一个特殊特征，而不是一般人所拥有的（尽管你可以通过扮演萨瓦金野蛮人来表现这一特质）。",
	"However, there are two significant challenges to adventuring as a sahuagin. The first is that you're an alien, a creature with a face few recognize, and that those who do typically view with fear. The second is the Limited Amphibiousness trait possessed by both sahuagin and locathah—a need for regular immersion in water can be a crippling requirement when an adventure leads to the Blade Desert. However, the sahuagin have developed a solution that solves both of these problems. While most people of the Five Nations have never {@i seen} a sahuagin, that doesn't mean they've never {@i met} one. Scholars who study the sahuagin know of malenti, sahuagin that are born indistinguishable from sea elves; the common belief is that this is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren't born, they're {@i made}. One of the sacred rituals of Sha'argon allows a sahuagin priest to guide a subject through ritually consuming a humanoid—and in consuming the creature, the sahuagin {@i becomes} that creature, taking both their form and their powers. People know about sea elf malenti, as they've been caught and exposed in the Dominion's long war with the Protectorate. But unbeknownst to the Five Nations, there are human malenti in Sharn, dwarf malenti in Stormreach, malenti passing as many races and traveling the surface wherever the Dominion needs eyes and hands.": "然而，作为一个萨瓦金人进行冒险有两个重大挑战。第一个挑战是你是一个外星人，是一个很少有人认识的生物，而那些认识的人通常会对你产生恐惧。其次是萨瓦金人和Locathah都具有的有限两栖性特征--当冒险前往刀锋沙漠时，需要经常浸泡在水中，这可能是一个令人沮丧的要求。然而，萨瓦金人已经开发出一种解决方案，解决了这两个问题。虽然五国的大多数人都没有（%0%）过萨瓦金人，但这并不意味着他们没有（%1%）过。研究萨瓦金人的学者们知道马伦蒂，即生来就与海精灵无异的萨瓦金人；普遍认为这是萨瓦金人和海精灵生活在一起时发生的随机变异。萨瓦金人很乐意支持这个神话，因为真相要令人不安得多。马伦蒂不是天生的，他们是（%2%）。Sha'argon的一个神圣仪式允许萨瓦金人的牧师引导一个对象通过仪式性地吞噬一个人形生物--在吞噬这个生物时，萨瓦金人（%3%）那个生物，同时拥有他们的形式和力量。人们知道海精灵马伦蒂，因为他们在多米尼克与保护国的长期战争中被抓住并暴露出来。但五国不知道的是，在沙恩有人类的马伦蒂，在风暴地带有矮人的马伦蒂，马伦蒂以许多种族的身份出现，在多米尼克需要眼睛和手的地方旅行。",
	"Chapter 6 provides a malenti background that could be coupled with any race, along with additional story hooks for malenti adventurers. Using this background, you can secretly play a sahuagin who's assumed the identity of the person they appear to be. While the Dominion has carried out a few targeted replacements to get malenti into influential positions, often malenti are just replacing people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: smugglers, fisherfolk, or pirates who strayed into Dominion territory. The purpose of this replacement isn't to take advantage of the character's previous life, but rather to place agents who can breathe on land and move freely without drawing attention. So as a malenti you might have been a sailor or a pirate—but now you're an adventurer traveling the world!": "第6章提供了一个可以与任何种族结合的马伦蒂背景，以及马伦蒂冒险者的额外故事钩。使用这个背景，你可以秘密地扮演一个萨瓦金人，他承担了他们看起来的身份。虽然统治者进行了一些有针对性的替换，让马伦蒂进入有影响力的位置，但通常马伦蒂只是替换那些碰巧在错误时间出现在错误地点的人：走私者、渔民或误入统治者领土的海盗。这种替换的目的不是利用角色以前的生活，而是为了安置那些可以在陆地上呼吸和自由移动而不引起注意的特工。因此，作为一个马伦蒂，你可能曾经是一个水手或海盗--但现在你是一个在世界范围内旅行的冒险家！\"。",
	"The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion are an advanced and ancient culture that has little interest in the surface world. Its people generally wouldn't randomly attack a fishing village. But what if you want an adventure where the sahuagin attack?": "永恒领地的萨瓦金人是一种先进而古老的文化，对表面世界没有什么兴趣。它的人民一般不会随意攻击一个渔村。但是，如果你想要一个萨瓦金人袭击的冒险呢？",
	"The Eternal Dominion is a culture, but the sahuagin species extends beyond it. In Khorvaire, you have humans of the Five Nations, but you also have humans of the Shadow Marches and humans of the Demon Wastes. Similarly, the Eternal Dominion hasn't extended beyond the Thunder Sea, and sahuagin in other waters may be very different; perhaps the sahuagin off the shores of the Demon Wastes have been twisted by their devotion to fiends. Even in the Thunder Sea, the border sahuagin are wilder than those of the inner Dominion, and you could find sahuagin in the fringes that have never accepted the traditions of the Dominion. The Eternal Dominion is a sahuagin culture, but it's not the only option. With that said, the secondary mutations—the barons, the malenti, the Claws of Sha'argon—are created using Dominion rituals and the blood of the kar'lassa, and these should be tied to the Eternal Dominion.": "永恒的主宰是一种文化，但萨瓦金人种的范围超出了它。在Khorvaire，你有五国的人类，但你也有阴影地带的人类和恶魔荒地的人类。同样地，永恒的统治还没有延伸到雷海之外，其他水域的萨瓦金人可能非常不同；也许恶魔荒原海岸的萨瓦金人已经被他们对恶魔的奉献所扭曲了。即使在雷海，边境的萨瓦金人也比内部的多米尼克的人更狂野，你可以在边缘地区找到从未接受多米尼克传统的萨瓦金人。永恒主宰是一种萨瓦金文化，但它不是唯一的选择。话虽如此，次级变异--男爵、马伦蒂、沙氩之爪都是利用多米尼克仪式和卡拉萨的血液创造出来的，这些都应该与永恒主宰联系在一起。",
	"The Eternal Dominion has no interest in conquering Khorvaire—at least for now. But the sahuagin believe life is conflict, and if you aren't moving forward, you'll wither away. This section contains story hooks and major aspirations of the sahuagin that might drive an encounter—or an entire campaign.": "永恒的统治者对征服Khorvaire没有兴趣--至少目前是这样。但萨瓦金人相信生活就是冲突，如果你不向前走，你就会枯萎。本节包含了萨瓦金人的故事钩子和主要愿望，可能会推动一场遭遇战--或者整个战役。",
	"The sahuagin hate the sea elves and yearn to hold dominion over the entirety of the Thunder Sea. The power of the Undying Court protects the elves from any direct assault, so the sahuagin must find another answer. They've been embedding malenti agents into the Valraean Protectorate for years. What's the next step? Will they launch a decisive first strike from within the Protectorate? Will they target Shae Mordai itself? Might they be willing to forge an alliance with a dragonmarked house or a dryskin nation to bring down the Protectorate?": "萨瓦金人憎恨海精灵，渴望掌握整个雷海的统治权。不死鸟法庭的力量保护着精灵们免受任何直接攻击，所以萨瓦金人必须找到另一个答案。多年来，他们一直在向瓦拉恩保护国安插马伦蒂的特工。下一步是什么？他们会从保护国内部发动决定性的第一次攻击吗？他们会把目标放在沙伊-莫尔达伊本身吗？他们会不会愿意与一个有龙纹的家族或一个干皮国家结成联盟来推翻保护国？",
	"The sahuagin don't need more land, but they're always hungry for more power. The most powerful beings in Eberron are the overlords of the First Age. These archfiends have lingered in their prisons since the dawn of time—while they can't be destroyed, could they be {@i consumed?} Could a sahuagin champion follow Sha'argon's path to divinity by somehow devouring the essence of an overlord, thus taking its spirit and strength? This goal could bring sahuagin agents to the surface if they determine the most vulnerable overlords are imprisoned on land. This is no simple task; it could require eldritch machines, planar alignments, and a particular unfolding of the Prophecy. Rak Tulkhesh is bound to multiple shards; perhaps the sahuagin have found a way to consume these one at a time, and now seek each shard. What will happen if a sahuagin champion completes this ascension?": "萨瓦金人不需要更多的土地，但他们总是渴望获得更多的权力。Eberron中最强大的生命是第一时代的霸主。这些大恶魔自古以来就在他们的监狱中徘徊，虽然他们无法被摧毁，但他们是否可以{@i consumed?}一个萨瓦金人的冠军可以通过某种方式吞噬一个霸主的精华，从而获得其精神和力量，来追随沙氩的神性之路？如果萨瓦金人确定最脆弱的霸主被囚禁在陆地上，这个目标可以将萨瓦金人特工带到地面上。这不是一个简单的任务；它可能需要长生机、平面排列和预言的特别展开。Rak Tulkhesh被捆绑在多个碎片上；也许萨瓦金人已经找到了一次吞噬这些碎片的方法，现在正在寻找每个碎片。如果一个萨瓦金人冠军完成了这一升华，会发生什么？",
	"The kar'lassa give the Eternal Dominion a foothold in eight planes, and they've been learning new ways to exploit this over the last century. Now, some among the Ta'har wonder if they could expand their influence, using the kar'lassa as an anchor from which to conquer a layer of a plane. This idea is unprecedented—is it even possible? Success could depend on recovering artifacts created by the Cul'sir giants during their war against the quori, and the sahuagin would need a way to bind the immortal spirits of that plane. Which plane will they try to conquer? What would happen to Eberron if they succeeded?": "卡拉萨给了永恒统治者在八个位面的立足点，在过去的一个世纪里，他们一直在学习新的方法来利用这一点。现在，Ta'har中的一些人想知道他们是否可以扩大他们的影响力，利用kar'lassa作为一个锚，从那里征服一个平面的某一层。这个想法是史无前例的--它甚至可能吗？成功与否可能取决于是否能找回库尔班巨人在与科里人的战争中创造的文物，而萨瓦金人需要一种方法来约束那个平面的不朽灵魂。他们会试图征服哪个位面？如果他们成功了，Eberron会发生什么？",

	"Children of the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, the merfolk have been drawn into Eberron time and again during grand convergences between the planes. Merfolk can be found across the seas of Eberron, and every kara—tribe—has its own traditions and customs. The primary merfolk culture in the Thunder Sea is Karakala, whose members call themselves the Kalamer.": "人鱼族是拉曼尼亚无尽之海的子民，在各位面之间的大融合中，他们一次又一次地被吸引到伊伯伦。人鱼族在Eberron的各个海域都能找到，每个卡拉部落都有自己的传统和习俗。雷海的主要人鱼文化是卡拉卡拉，其成员自称为卡拉默。",
	"The Thunder Sea has many strong manifest zones to Lamannia, the source of the endless storms that give the region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion were lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged. At the height of this disaster, Kalamer merfolk were pulled through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the sahuagin and sea elves agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper waters, so long as they managed the manifest zones. Today, many Kalamer consider the Thunder Sea their new home, and travel from zone to zone, practicing their primal traditions. In a sense, they're nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As they're recognized as neutral by both the Dominion and the Protectorate, they often serve as messengers, couriers, and mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these powers—an important role, as the sahuagin refuse to speak directly to the sea elves. The reach of Karakala extends along the southern coast of Khorvaire, and the arrival of a Kalamer bard is often a celebrated event in small Brelish or Zil fishing villages; more than once, they've managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.": "雷海有许多强势的显露区，到拉曼尼亚，是无尽风暴的源头，该地区的名字就是这样的。近两个世纪前，一次异常强烈的汇合放大了显化区的影响。Valraean保护国和Eternal Dominion都被Lamannia的力量所鞭打，人们担心世界之间的屏障会被永久地破坏。在这场灾难的高峰期，卡拉默人鱼族被从拉曼尼亚拉过来；他们发现自己没有办法回家，就用他们的仪式和典礼来控制和修复损害。上游水域的这些野生区域一直是一个威胁，一旦明确卡拉卡拉可以减轻危险，萨瓦金人和海精灵都同意给他们在上游水域旅行的自由，只要他们管理好显露的区域。今天，许多卡拉卡拉认为雷海是他们的新家，他们从一个区到另一个区，实践着他们的原始传统。从某种意义上说，他们是游牧的园丁，保护着野性。由于他们被多米尼克和保护国承认为中立者，他们经常充当信使、信使和调解人，代表这些势力传递消息和进行谈判--这是一个重要的角色，因为萨瓦金人拒绝与海精灵直接对话。卡拉卡拉的势力范围沿霍尔韦尔南部海岸延伸，卡拉默吟游诗人的到来往往是布雷利什或齐尔小渔村的庆祝活动；他们不止一次成功地解决了渔民和统治者之间的争端。",
	"Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all with traveling between the manifest zones—which they call the roots—and performing the rituals that keep them stable. However, there are Kalamer pods who quietly despise those who bend nature for their own benefit—dryskin, sahuagin, and sea elf alike—and especially oppose the use of elemental binding; these have come to see House Lyrandar as their foes. There are Kalamer who dream of someday cleansing the oceans of all traces of industry, of unleashing the full power of the manifest zones instead of keeping them contained. To date, Karakala has maintained its peaceful course, but it's always possible that their darker impulses will rise to the fore—that they'll show House Lyrandar and the nations of the world the true power of the storm.": "总的来说，卡拉卡拉是一个中立的力量，首先关注的是在显化区之间的旅行--他们称之为根部--以及执行保持它们稳定的仪式。然而，有一些卡拉麦荚悄悄地鄙视那些为了自己的利益而弯曲自然的人--干皮、萨瓦金和海精灵都是如此--尤其反对使用元素束缚；这些人已经把利兰达家族视为他们的敌人了。有一些卡拉玛人梦想着有一天能够清洗海洋中所有的工业痕迹，释放出显化区的全部力量，而不是将它们控制起来。迄今为止，卡拉卡拉一直保持着它的和平路线，但他们更黑暗的冲动总是有可能上升到前台--他们会向利兰达家族和世界各国展示风暴的真正力量。",
	"The Kalamer are a primal people, feeling the currents, tides, and winds in a profound way; some say that the ocean sings a song. Consider these philosophies when dealing with merfolk of Karakala:": "卡拉玛人是一个原始的民族，以一种深刻的方式感受着水流、潮汐和风；有人说，海洋在唱歌。在与卡拉卡拉的人鱼族打交道时，请考虑这些哲学。",
	"{@i \"The water is always moving; follow it, let the currents guide you.\"} Kalamer prefer to remain in motion, and deeply rely on instinct and intuition.": "{@i \"The water is always moving; follow it, let the currents guide you.\"}卡拉姆更喜欢保持运动状态，并深深依赖本能和直觉。",
	"{@i \"Flow around a problem or away from it.\"} Kalamer value flexibility over pride and aggression.": "{@i \"Flow around a problem or away from it.\"} Kalamer重视灵活性，而不是骄傲和侵略性。",
	"{@i \"Keep only that which lifts you up, not what drags you down.\"} Kalamer avoid anything that anchors them too strongly to one place or mood, including property and vendettas.": "{@i \"Keep only that which lifts you up, not what drags you down.\"}卡拉姆人避免任何使他们太强烈地固定在一个地方或情绪上的东西，包括财产和仇杀。",
	"{@i \"Make no judgment until you know the story.\"} Kalamer are naturally curious and seek to understand the people and things they encounter.": "{@i \"Make no judgment until you know the story.\"}卡拉姆人天生好奇，寻求了解他们遇到的人和事。",
	"Karakala is a culture rather than a nation. There are approximately ten thousand Kalamer spread across the Thunder Sea, but they claim no territory and have no single leader. Most live in small pods, following a pattern of migration between the manifest zones of the upper water. When they reach a manifest zone, they remain there for a week or so, performing primal rituals that stabilize the zone. They prize manifest zones to Lamannia, and time spent at a Lamannian zone is a time of celebration. However, they travel to all manifest zones, and their rituals can contain the harmful effects of any manifest zone.": "卡拉卡拉是一种文化，而不是一个国家。大约有一万名卡拉卡拉人分布在雷海，但他们没有宣称自己的领土，也没有单一的领袖。大多数人生活在小豆荚里，按照一种模式在上层水域的表现区之间迁移。当他们到达一个显露区时，他们会在那里停留一个星期左右，进行稳定该区域的原始仪式。他们奖励拉曼尼亚的显露区，在拉曼尼亚区度过的时间是一个庆祝的时刻。然而，他们前往所有的显化区，他们的仪式可以遏制任何显化区的有害影响。",
	"The Kalamer don't worship deities, but revere the forces of nature and believe the world speaks to those who listen. While outsiders might view this as worshiping Eberron, the Kalamer don't need to anthropomorphize nature for it to be worthy of reverence. The Kalamer value wisdom over strength, and the leader of the pod holds that position because the others trust their instincts; often they're an elder, but age isn't a requirement.": "卡拉默人不崇拜神灵，但崇尚自然的力量，并相信世界会对那些倾听者说话。虽然外人可能会认为这是对Eberron的崇拜，但卡拉默人不需要将自然拟人化就值得敬畏了。卡拉默人重视智慧而非力量，豆荚的领导者占据着这个位置，因为其他人信任他们的直觉；他们通常是长者，但年龄并不是一个要求。",
	"In general, Karakala is peaceful; this is one reason both the Dominion and Protectorate allow the Kalamer to move freely. Most merfolk seek to understand any threats they encounter, to see if they can find a way to coexist—or failing that, to simply move past the danger. However, they can be dangerous foes when they're forced to act or encounter a true threat to the balance of nature.": "一般来说，卡拉卡拉是和平的；这也是统治国和保护国都允许卡拉马自由行动的原因之一。大多数人鱼寻求了解他们遇到的任何威胁，看看他们是否能找到一种共存的方式，或者如果不能，就简单地越过危险。然而，当他们被迫采取行动或遇到对自然平衡的真正威胁时，他们会成为危险的敌人。",
	"Kalamer fashion is simple and functional. It's rare for Kalamer to wear anything heavier than leather armor, and most just wear leather straps to hold their tools and personal possessions. Many carry small tokens—shells, stones, bones—that remind them of a place or moment. Sometimes humans describe hearing the sound of the ocean in a shell; however, many Kalamer truly receive primal impressions from natural objects.": "卡拉默的时尚是简单而实用的。卡拉默人很少穿比皮甲更重的东西，大多数人只穿皮带来装他们的工具和个人财产。许多人带着小信物--贝壳、石头、骨头--让他们想起某个地方或时刻。有时人类会描述在贝壳中听到海洋的声音；然而，许多卡拉麦人真正从自然物体中获得原始的印象。",
	"Kalamer speak Aquan, their native tongue from Lamannia. Most of them also speak either Elvish, Common, or Sahuagin, depending on where their route takes them, and merfolk bards may speak all of these. Any Kalamer capable of casting at least one Druidic spell can speak Druidic, which they consider to be the language of the wind and water.": "Kalamer说Aquan语，这是他们来自Lamannia的母语。他们中的大多数人还会说精灵语、普通话或萨瓦金语，这取决于他们的路线走向，而人鱼吟游诗人可能会说所有这些语言。任何有能力施展至少一个德鲁伊法术的卡拉麦人都能说德鲁伊语，他们认为这是风和水的语言。",
	"The merfolk of Karakala can be found across the Thunder Sea; Kalamer pods follow migratory patterns, while wandering sirens let intuition guide them. The Kalamer remain in the upper waters where sunlight allows photosynthesis. There are no Kalamer cities, but they establish simple outposts along their migratory paths, often in masses of floating vegetation (which are especially common in Lamannian manifest zones).": "卡拉卡拉的人鱼族在整个雷霆海都能找到；卡拉玛的豆荚遵循迁徙模式，而流浪的海妖则由直觉引导。卡拉默人留在上层水域，那里的阳光可以进行光合作用。没有卡拉默的城市，但他们沿着迁徙路线建立了简单的前哨站，通常是在大量的浮动植被中（在拉曼尼亚的显影区特别常见）。",
	"Many pods bond with a dragon turtle, which serves as the locus of the pod; the merfolk strap themselves to the turtle when they sleep. Unlike the dragon turtles of the Eternal Dominion, this is a symbiotic relationship; the merfolk help their companion find food and keep the dragon turtle entertained. Other pods bond with gargantuan beasts that have passed into Eberron from Lamannia.": "许多豆荚与龙龟结合，龙龟是豆荚的中心；人鱼族睡觉时把自己绑在龙龟身上。与永恒国度的龙龟不同，这是一种共生关系；人鱼族帮助他们的同伴寻找食物，并让龙龟得到娱乐。其他豆荚则与从拉曼尼亚进入埃伯龙的巨兽结合。",
	"Karakala has no tradition of wizardry or artifice. However, most Kalamer possess at least a touch of primal magic, and can shape water or strike a foe with a thunderclap; this can be reflected by giving Kalamer merfolk a cantrip or single-use spell from the druid or ranger spell list. Kalamer with greater gifts are called stormcallers, and can summon lightning and wind; these are discussed in more depth in chapter 8. Kalamer champions could possess the abilities of rangers or druids, and might be able to assume the forms of deadly sea creatures.": "卡拉卡拉没有巫术或工匠的传统。然而，大多数卡拉玛人至少拥有一丝原始魔法，他们可以塑造水或用雷鸣来打击敌人；这可以通过给卡拉玛人的人马提供德鲁伊或游侠法术列表中的咒语或一次性法术来体现。拥有更多天赋的卡拉默被称为风暴召唤者，可以召唤闪电和风；这些将在第八章中深入讨论。Kalamer冠军可以拥有游侠或德鲁伊的能力，并且可能会变成致命的海洋生物的形态。",
	"Other Kalamer hear music in the motion of wind and water and become bards. Kalamer sirens can weave illusions with their words, or cloud the minds of enemies. These sirens often travel alone, sharing news and songs both with Kalamer pods and with all other ships and communities they come across. While most Kalamer bards seek to bring joy to everyone they encounter, there are stories of sirens turned bitter after the destruction of a pod or witnessing great cruelty; these merfolk may turn their powers to punishing those they see as evil. Kalamer bards generally rely on their voices as opposed to using instruments, and can sing while submerged.": "其他卡拉默人在风和水的运动中听到音乐，并成为吟游诗人。卡拉默海妖可以用他们的语言编织幻觉，或者蒙蔽敌人的头脑。这些海妖经常独自旅行，与卡拉默人的吊舱以及他们遇到的所有其他船只和社区分享消息和歌曲。虽然大多数卡拉默吟游诗人寻求给他们遇到的每个人带来欢乐，但也有海妖在船舱被毁或目睹了巨大的残忍行为后变得痛苦的故事；这些人鱼可能会将他们的力量转向惩罚那些他们认为是邪恶的人。卡拉默吟游诗人通常依靠他们的声音，而不是使用乐器，并且可以在水下唱歌。",

	"Karakala is politically neutral, holding no nation or people above any other. A siren or pod may have a strong bond to a particular fishing village, but that affection doesn't extend to the dryskin nation that claims it. Generally, Karakala tries to ignore the actions of nations, focusing on its never-ending pilgrimage, though individual Kalamer—sirens, triton champions—may become more actively involved with a single nation.": "卡拉卡拉在政治上是中立的，没有任何国家或民族凌驾于任何其他国家或民族之上。一个海妖或豆荚可能与某个特定的渔村有很强的联系，但这种感情并不延伸到声称拥有它的干皮国家。一般来说，卡拉卡拉试图忽略国家的行动，专注于它永无止境的朝圣之旅，尽管个别卡拉默人、特里顿冠军可能会更积极地参与某个国家。",
	"While they maintain their neutrality and serve as messengers and couriers between all the people of the sea, Karakala doesn't {@i like} the Eternal Dominion or the Valraean Protectorate. The Kalamer dislike seeing any creature held in bondage, and they may help renegade locathah or smugglers sailing beyond approved Dominion routes. However, while they may help peaceful smugglers, they dislike cruelty and greed; violent pirates can find that the merfolk are just as dangerous as House Lyrandar or a Dominion patrol.": "虽然他们保持中立，并作为所有海洋人民之间的信使和信使，但卡拉卡拉并不{@i like}是永恒主宰或瓦拉恩保护国的。卡拉卡拉人不喜欢看到任何被束缚的生物，他们可能会帮助叛逆的Locathah或走私者在被批准的统治者路线之外航行。然而，虽然他们可能会帮助和平的走私者，但他们不喜欢残忍和贪婪；暴力的海盗会发现人鱼族和Lyrandar家族或Dominion巡逻队一样危险。",
	"To date, Karakala has been a passive, mediating force, trusted by all. But the fact remains that Kalamer dislike all forms of industry in the sea. If it were an option, many Kalamer would destroy all dryskin shipping and shatter the cities of the Dominion and Protectorate alike. Currently, they work to contain the manifest zones of the Thunder Sea and to keep peace; but if they chose, they could instead release the power of these zones to terrible effect. Hostile Kalamer could begin by calling elemental tempests and megafauna beasts from Lamannia and unleashing them into shipping lanes, increasing the dangers of the sea—with plausible deniability as to their source. By coordinating rituals with coterminous periods, the Kalamer could dramatically enhance the effects of manifest zones. Using the Lamannia zones in this way, they could create devastating hurricanes and tsunamis. Could tidal waves devastate Stormreach, or elemental hurricanes topple one of the towers of Sharn? Karakala has no interest in conquest; if the merfolk pursued this course of action, it would purely be to drive commerce and civilization from the sea.": "迄今为止，卡拉卡拉一直是一个被动的、调解的力量，受到所有人的信任。但事实是，卡拉卡拉不喜欢一切形式的海洋工业。如果可以的话，许多卡拉卡拉会摧毁所有的干皮航运，并粉碎多米尼加和保护国的城市。目前，他们的工作是遏制雷海的显化区并维持和平；但如果他们选择，他们反而可以释放这些显化区的力量，产生可怕的效果。敌对的卡拉默可以从拉曼尼亚召唤元素风暴和巨型动物野兽开始，并将它们释放到航道上，增加海洋的危险性--对它们的来源进行合理的否认。通过协调仪式与同时期的关系，卡拉默可以极大地增强显灵区的效果。以这种方式使用拉曼尼亚区，他们可以创造毁灭性的飓风和海啸。潮汐可以摧毁风暴地带，或者元素飓风可以推翻沙恩的一座塔？卡拉卡拉对征服没有兴趣；如果人鱼族采取这种行动，那将纯粹是为了把商业和文明从海上赶走。",
	"Kalamer are at home in the water, and rarely have any interest in walking on dry land. However, a few do hear the wind calling them to emerge from the water. A Kalamer who embraces this path can gain the ability to transform into a fully humanoid form—that of a triton—able to operate freely in dry land.": "卡拉默以水为家，很少有兴趣在干地上行走。然而，少数人确实听到风在召唤他们从水中出来。拥抱这条道路的卡拉默可以获得变身为完全的人形的能力--也就是可以在旱地上自由活动的三顿。",
	"Most Kalamer tritons have a strong sense of purpose—a call that's drawn them to leave their pod and the sea behind. In general, the Kalamer work to protect the balance of nature; a triton might be drawn to investigate the Mourning, to help the Gatekeepers battle aberrations, or even to oppose the dragonmarked houses. Such a champion of nature might be a coastal druid of the Circle of Land, a ranger (likely a Hunter, Monster Slayer, or Horizon Walker), or even a paladin with the Oath of the Ancients.": "大多数卡拉默三体人都有一种强烈的使命感--一种吸引他们离开他们的船舱和大海的召唤。一般来说，卡拉默人致力于保护自然界的平衡；一个三体人可能会被吸引去调查哀伤，帮助守门人对抗异常现象，甚至是反对龙纹屋。这样的自然冠军可能是土地之环的沿海德鲁伊、游侠（可能是猎人、怪物杀手或地平线行者），甚至是拥有古人之誓的圣骑士。",
	"The Kalamer triton could also be a bard; sometimes it's easier to investigate the Mourning or fight dragonmarked houses with words instead of primal magic. Triton bards are likely to follow their people's drive to help bring people together and settle disputes. The College of Glamour could reflect the enthralling song of the siren, but the College of Lore is also an option for a bard.": "卡拉默-特里顿也可能是一名吟游诗人；有时，用语言而不是原始魔法来调查悼念活动或与龙纹屋作战会更容易。特里顿的吟游诗人很可能追随他们民族的动力，帮助人们团结起来，解决争端。魅力学院可以反映出海妖令人陶醉的歌声，但传说学院也是吟游诗人的一个选择。",
	"As a Kalamer triton, you've left your entire world behind you. Do you miss your pod and the songs of the ocean? Or are you following the basic drives of Karakala—to always move forward, and not to let the anchors of the past pull you down? As someone born in a wild, primal world, how do you deal with the intense civilization of a city such as Sharn?": "作为一个卡拉默三体人，你已经离开了你的整个世界。你是否怀念你的船舱和海洋之歌？或者你是否遵循卡拉卡拉的基本驱动力--永远向前，不要让过去的锚把你拉下来？作为一个出生在野性、原始世界的人，你是如何处理像沙恩这样的城市的激烈文明的？",
	"Kalamer tritons use the {@race triton|VGM} racial traits provided in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}, with two changes. These replace the Languages trait of the standard triton:": "卡拉默三体人使用{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}中提供的{@race triton|VGM}种族特征，但有两个变化。这些特性取代了标准三体人的语言特性。",
	"When you finish a short rest, you can change your form. You can either take on the two-legged form of a triton, or the form of a merfolk with a tail. While in merfolk form, your base walking speed is reduced to 10 feet, and your swimming speed is increased to 40 feet. When you assume merfolk form, you can choose whether equipment and clothing worn on your legs falls to the ground, or whether it's merged into your body until you resume your triton form. The transformation has no other effects.": "当你完成短暂的休息后，你可以改变你的形态。你可以变成三足动物的双腿形态，或者变成有尾巴的人鱼形态。当你变成人鱼形态时，你的基本行走速度降低到10英尺，而你的游泳速度增加到40英尺。当你变成人鱼形态时，你可以选择穿在你腿上的装备和衣服是掉在地上，还是融入你的身体，直到你恢复三叉戟形态。这种转变没有其他影响。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Aquan.": "你能说、读、写普通话和阿肯语。",

	"As adventurers visit a coastal town, they hear a beautiful, clear song rising from the harbor and see people running towards the pier. The arrival of a Kalamer siren is a celebrated event along the southern coast; even the Ghaal'dar welcome friendly sirens. These bards bring news and stories of the sea—of ships in the area, storms, or even just gossip from the next village down the coast—combined with enthralling song. Aside from being an interesting scene, the siren could bring news that's directly relevant to the adventurers—perhaps news of a ship they were waiting for that was sunk offshore, or perhaps they'll share a story of a ruin hidden off the coast. As sirens act as intermediaries, a bard could also come carrying a message for the adventurers from a powerful figure in the Dominion or Protectorate.": "当冒险家们访问一个沿海城镇时，他们听到了从港口升起的美丽而清脆的歌声，看到人们向码头跑去。卡拉默海妖的到来是南部海岸的一个值得庆祝的事件；甚至连盖尔达尔人都欢迎友好的海妖。这些吟游诗人带来了海上的新闻和故事--该地区的船只、风暴，甚至只是来自海岸线下一个村庄的八卦--与令人陶醉的歌曲结合在一起。除了是一个有趣的场景之外，海妖还可能带来与冒险者直接相关的消息--也许是他们正在等待的一艘船在近海沉没的消息，或者他们会分享一个隐藏在海岸边的遗迹的故事。由于海妖充当了中间人的角色，吟游诗人也可以为冒险者带去来自统治国或保护国中有权势人物的消息。",
	"Perhaps the characters' ship leaves the safe trade routes and runs afoul of an endless storm. Or maybe they're simply crippled by pirates, or by a forgotten weapon of the Last War. A pod of Kalamer can save the characters, using primal magic to allow the dryskins to breathe underwater, helping them to safety. But do the Kalamer need something in return? A powerful monstrosity could be lurking around a manifest zone, preventing the pod from performing their rituals. Or an aboleth serving the Lurker in Shadow may have captured members of their pod; they need help to defeat the beast.": "也许人物的船离开了安全的贸易路线，遇到了无尽的风暴。或者，他们只是被海盗或被最后战争中被遗忘的武器打成了残废。Kalamer舱可以拯救这些角色，使用原始魔法让干皮在水下呼吸，帮助他们到达安全地带。但是，卡拉姆人需要什么作为回报吗？一个强大的怪兽可能潜伏在一个显露区周围，阻止吊舱进行他们的仪式。或者一个为阴影中的潜伏者服务的aboleth可能俘虏了他们豆荚中的成员；他们需要帮助来打败这个野兽。",
	"Though Kalamer are peaceful, the stormcaller Llaratala can no longer share the water with House Lyrandar and its oppression of elementals. She and her pod are targeting elemental galleons, shattering Lyrandar ships and freeing the bound spirits. The house hires the adventurers to find out who's responsible for the destruction of their vessels. How will the characters track the merfolk mastermind, and what will they choose to do?": "虽然卡拉玛是和平的，但风暴召唤者拉拉塔拉不能再与利兰达尔家族及其对元素的压迫分享水。她和她的船舱以元素帆船为目标，击碎了Lyrandar的船只，释放了被束缚的灵魂。该家族雇佣了冒险者来找出谁该对他们的船只被毁负责。角色们将如何追踪人鱼族的主谋，他们又会选择怎样做？",
	"A Kalamer hails the druid of the party while the adventurers are on the coast or on a ship. The stormspeaker addresses them in Druidic, as a fellow defender of the natural world, asking them to help deal with an unnatural threat.

	"Long ago, the waters along the western coast of Aerenal were inhabited by peaceful locathah. The sahuagin of Sha'argon's Kingdom—a predecessor to the Eternal Dominion—steadily advanced toward Aerenal, conquering and assimilating the locathah. Concerned by the obvious aggression of the sahuagin, the Sibling Kings acted to secure the waters around Aerenal, establishing a buffer zone that would ensure that Sha'argon's Kingdom posed no direct threat. The line of Valraea was chosen, and through the power of the Undying Court, its nobles were physically transformed into {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}, gaining iridescent skin and the ability to breathe beneath the water.": "很久以前，Aerenal西海岸的水域中居住着和平的Locathah。Sha'argon王国的Sahuagin--永恒统治者的前身--稳步向Aerenal推进，征服并同化了locathah。出于对萨瓦金人明显的侵略性的担忧，兄弟姐妹国王们采取行动，保护Aerenal周围的水域，建立一个缓冲区，确保沙阿贡王国不构成直接威胁。瓦拉亚一系被选中，通过不死阁的力量，其贵族的身体被转化为（%0%），获得了彩虹色的皮肤和在水底呼吸的能力。",
	"Initially, the line of Valraea served as protectors and advisors, organizing the locathah and helping them construct superior defenses. Then the attacks began. The conflict slowly escalated; the harder the locathah fought, the more it drove sahuagin determination to claim the region. Valraean priests brought the full power of the Undying Court to bear against the attackers, and Sha'argon's Kingdom couldn't match their transcendent might. A generation later the sahuagin returned, and the elves retaliated, using the divine power of the Undying Court to seize the Sha'argon border fortresses. It was at this time—when the region claimed included both sahuagin and locathah lands—that the elves officially declared it the Valraean Protectorate. According to the proclamation, the Undying Court would protect all peoples of the Protectorate and the line of Valraea would provide them with guidance and security... all of which was a gentle way of saying that the people were now under Aereni rule and would be forced to embrace Aereni customs. While this decision was driven in part by a desire to ensure the island's security, it may have also been tied to the discovery of dragonshard deposits along the seabed—both fallen Siberys shards and indications of deep Khyber shards.": "起初，瓦拉亚一系充当保护者和顾问，组织locathah，帮助他们建造优越的防御设施。然后，攻击开始了。冲突慢慢升级；locathah打得越狠，就越促使sahuagin下定决心要占领这个地区。瓦拉恩的牧师们发挥了不朽之庭的全部力量来对付进攻者，而沙阿贡的王国无法与他们超凡的力量相提并论。一代人之后，萨瓦金人回来了，精灵们进行了报复，利用不死阁的神圣力量夺取了沙氩的边境堡垒。正是在这个时候，当声称的地区包括萨瓦金人和洛加塔人的土地时，精灵们正式宣布它为瓦拉恩保护国。根据该公告，不朽的法庭将保护保护国的所有人民，瓦拉亚家族将为他们提供指导和安全......所有这些都是一种温和的说法，即人民现在处于Aereni的统治之下，将被迫接受Aereni的习俗。虽然这一决定的部分原因是为了确保该岛的安全，但它也可能与海底发现的龙石矿藏有关--既有掉落的西伯利亚碎片，也有深层开伯尔碎片的迹象。",
	"The next thousand years brought chaos, as the sahuagin—first Sha'argon's Kingdom, then the Eternal Dominion—continued to attack and the Valraean elves continued to retaliate by conquering additional sahuagin territories. But the power of the Undying Court is geographically limited. While clerics can draw on the power of the Court to cast spells anywhere in the world, the transcendent might that can repel dragons or defeat sahuagin armies has a limited range. When the elves pressed beyond that, they suffered terrible losses; and yet, the Dominion couldn't challenge the elves within the Court's sphere of influence. This began a long stalemate that continues to this day. The Eternal Dominion has launched numerous attacks over the last few centuries, testing the power of the Undying Court, but thus far, the might of the deathless has been sufficient to repel every sahuagin assault.": "接下来的一千年带来了混乱，因为萨瓦金人--首先是Sha'argon王国，然后是永恒的统治者--继续进攻，而瓦拉恩精灵继续通过征服更多的萨瓦金人领土进行报复。但不死阁的力量在地理上是有限的。虽然神职人员可以借助法院的力量在世界任何地方施法，但能够击退龙或击败萨瓦金军队的超凡力量的范围是有限的。当精灵们超越这个范围时，他们遭受了可怕的损失；然而，统治者无法在法院的影响范围内挑战精灵们。这开始了漫长的僵局，一直持续到今天。在过去的几个世纪里，\"永恒的主宰 \"发动了无数次进攻，考验着不死鸟法庭的力量，但迄今为止，不死鸟的力量足以击退每一次萨瓦金的进攻。",
	"Most subjects of the Valraean Protectorate are locathah and sahuagin; despite this, the Protectorate is modeled after Aereni society in many ways. In Aerenal, any elf can prove themselves worthy of joining the noble line. In the Protectorate, subjects likewise strive to prove their worth—but in this case, they seek to be worthy of {@i serving} the elves of the noble line. Valraean subjects are raised to believe that all elves are semidivine beings. They're ancient and wise, masters of powerful magic and remarkable skills... and most importantly, only elves can ascend to join the Undying Court.": "瓦拉恩保护国的大多数臣民都是locathah和sahuagin；尽管如此，保护国在很多方面都是仿照艾瑞尼社会的。在艾瑞尼，任何精灵都可以证明自己有资格加入贵族行列。在保护国，臣民同样努力证明自己的价值--但在这种情况下，他们寻求配得上（%0%）贵族阶层的精灵。Valraean的臣民在成长过程中相信，所有的精灵都是半神的存在。他们古老而睿智，掌握着强大的魔法和非凡的技能......而最重要的是，只有精灵才能升入不朽阁。",
	"The sea elves of the line of Valraea live in the midst of this enforced adulation. They're idolized and adored from birth, and have been playing the role of divine guardians and guides for so long that many have come to believe it: they {@i were} shaped by the Undying Court to be the guardians of the sea, and they do stand above their adoring subjects. But while the Valraean sea elves are often arrogant and overconfident, they generally strive to live up to that vision, to protect anyone in their charge, to be the noble and gracious rulers that (most of) their subjects imagine them to be. They aren't petty tyrants; they believe in ensuring the safety and security of their people—but they also feel no qualms about the fact that their subjects are ultimately trapped in their lives, with all positions of power held by sea elves. They consider their privilege logical and natural; and so do the overwhelming majority of Valraean subjects, who believe the elves, with their long lives and deathless ancestors, are more capable than other mortals could ever be with their fleeting lifespans.": "瓦拉亚系的海精灵生活在这种强制的崇拜之中。他们从出生起就被视为偶像，受到崇拜，长期以来一直扮演着神圣的守护者和引导者的角色，以至于许多人都相信：他们（%0%）被不朽的法庭塑造为海洋的守护者，他们确实站在他们崇拜的对象之上。但是，虽然瓦拉恩海精灵经常傲慢和过度自信，但他们一般会努力实现这个愿景，保护他们负责的任何人，成为（大多数）他们的臣民所想象的高贵而亲切的统治者。他们不是小气的暴君；他们相信要确保人民的安全和保障--但他们也对他们的臣民最终被困在他们的生活中感到毫无顾虑，所有的权力位置都由海精灵掌握。他们认为自己的特权是合乎逻辑和自然的；绝大多数瓦拉恩的臣民也是如此，他们认为精灵们拥有漫长的生命和不死的祖先，比其他凡人短暂的寿命更有能力。",
	"Meanwhile, Valraean subjects believe they too are elevated above all outsiders, lower than the elves, but still blessed to receive the guidance of the elves and the living (or rather, deathless) gods of the Undying Court. And most subjects strive to prove themselves worthy of this blessing. All subjects of the Protectorate receive an education and learn trades. Its people engage in simple industry that no Aereni elf wants to dirty their hands with, as well as laboring to provide an important source of dragonshards for the mainland. In all of this, Valraeans are generally honest and industrious, trying to emulate the Aereni and perfect their skills; but they're taught that they'll never be as gifted as elves, since an Aereni elf spends an entire locathah lifetime in just their initial studies. This reflects the cornerstone of Valraean culture, which is, boiled down, that {@i elves are glorious and better at everything than you}. As a Valraean you're just lucky to be near elves, to have their guidance and protection. It's your duty to honor the Undying Court, because without it, you would be torn apart by the vicious sahuagin in the cruel world outside the Protectorate. And while no non-elf has ever proven worthy to join the Undying Court—how could they, with a paltry century to perfect their skills—maybe, just {@i maybe}, if you keep working hard enough and become the best person you can be, you might be the first.": "同时，瓦拉恩的臣民相信他们也被提升到所有外人之上，比精灵更低，但仍有福气接受精灵和不死阁的活神（或者说，不死）的指导。而大多数臣民都努力证明自己配得上这种祝福。保护国的所有臣民都接受教育和学习行业。它的人民从事简单的工业，没有一个Aereni精灵愿意弄脏他们的手，同时也为大陆提供重要的龙碎片来源而劳动。在这一切中，瓦尔拉人一般都很诚实和勤奋，试图模仿艾瑞尼人并完善他们的技能；但他们被告知，他们永远不会像精灵那样有天赋，因为艾瑞尼精灵仅在最初的学习中就花费了整个locathah的时间。这反映了瓦拉因文化的基石，归纳起来就是：（%0%）。作为一个瓦拉因人，你很幸运能靠近精灵，得到他们的指导和保护。你有责任尊重不朽之庭，因为没有它，你会在保护国之外的残酷世界里被邪恶的萨瓦金人撕碎。虽然没有一个非精灵被证明有资格加入不死鸟法庭，但他们怎么可能，用一个微不足道的世纪来完善他们的技能--也许，只是{@i maybe}，如果你继续努力，成为你能成为的最好的人，你可能成为第一个。",
	"While many members of the line of Valraea believe their own propaganda, the simple truth is that the benevolent Protectorate is an oppressive regime, sometimes brutally so. The line of Valraea has long worked to stamp out all traces of the native cultures, replacing the local languages with Elvish and eliminating the locathah religion. Few subjects publicly challenge elven rule, but those who do are quickly silenced. But despite these efforts, there are those among the masses who resist the Valraean propaganda and seek to reclaim and preserve their ancient traditions. Rebel sahuagin may work with malenti and support Dominion espionage. The locathah have a more difficult path, as for their kind, life in the Dominion would be even worse than in the Protectorate. But the locathah resistance still clings to hope, believing that as long as they are free in their hearts, they may yet find a way to overthrow all of the tyrants.": "虽然瓦拉亚家族的许多成员相信他们自己的宣传，但简单的事实是，仁慈的保护国是一个压迫性的政权，有时甚至是残酷的。长期以来，瓦拉亚一系一直致力于消除所有本土文化的痕迹，用精灵语取代当地语言，并消除了Locathah宗教。很少有臣民公开挑战精灵的统治，但那些挑战者很快就会被压制。但是，尽管有这些努力，群众中还是有一些人抵制瓦拉恩的宣传，并寻求恢复和保护他们的古老传统。反叛的萨瓦金人可能与马伦蒂合作，并支持多米尼克的间谍活动。locathah的道路更加艰难，因为对他们这种人来说，在多米尼克的生活会比在保护国的生活更加糟糕。但locathah的抵抗力量仍然坚持着希望，相信只要他们的内心是自由的，他们就有可能找到推翻所有暴君的方法。",
	"Valraean subjects are split into houses, each of which includes members of multiple species; this, in part, serves to deemphasize the importance of direct family. Each house has a patron in the Undying Court. They are taught to idolize this patron and believe that it personally protects them; in some cases this may actually be true, though many deathless councilors pay no attention to their Valraean devotees. Regardless, the Valraeans' ongoing adoration of the Undying Court provides a valuable source of positive energy for the Court itself.": "瓦拉恩人被分成几个家族，每个家族都包括多个物种的成员；这在某种程度上是为了强调直接家庭的重要性。每个家族在不朽之庭都有一个赞助人。他们被教导要崇拜这个守护者，并相信它能亲自保护他们；在某些情况下，这可能是真的，尽管许多无死亡的理事们并不关注他们的瓦尔拉人的信徒。不管怎么说，瓦拉恩人对不死阁的持续崇拜为不死阁本身提供了一个宝贵的正能量来源。",
	"Valraean fashion largely mirrors that of Aerenal, though using different materials. Fine leather takes the place of cloth, and Valraeans generally wear less clothing than their counterparts on the surface. Coral, ivory, and bloodvines (described in Tools and Traditions) are often used as ornaments. As in Aerenal, masks are important accessories; elves wear full face masks, while accomplished non-elves generally wear masks that cover their lower faces.": "瓦拉因的时尚在很大程度上反映了艾瑞纳的时尚，尽管使用的材料不同。精致的皮革取代了布，瓦拉伊人通常比地面上的人穿得少。珊瑚、象牙和血藤（在工具和传统中有所描述）经常被用作装饰品。和艾瑞纳一样，面具是重要的配件；精灵们戴着全脸面具，而有成就的非精灵一般戴着覆盖下脸的面具。",
	"All subjects of the Protectorate speak Elvish. This replaces Aquan among locathah and Sahuagin among sahuagin. Those who dream of resistance work to preserve their ancestral languages, but they're not spoken where elves can overhear them.": "保护国的所有臣民都说精灵语。这在locathah中取代了Aquan，在sahuagin中取代了Sahuagin。那些梦想反抗的人努力保留他们的祖先语言，但在精灵可以听到的地方不说这些语言。",
	"The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are Aereni elves, though they use a different subrace. They still have cousins on the surface, take vacations on Aerenal, and travel to Shae Mordai to consult with the Deathless Councilors. So while there's some cultural divergence, they're still loyal to the fundamental principles of Aerenal and think of themselves as Aereni. And most of all, it is possible for sea elves of the line of Valraea to become deathless. There are deathless sea elves in the Valrean Protectorate—soldiers and councilors who protect and guide the people—and a few ancient sea elves sit on the councils of Shae Mordai.": "瓦拉恩保护国的海精灵是艾瑞尼精灵，尽管他们使用不同的亚种。他们在海面上仍有表亲，在阿伦纳上度假，并前往沙伊-莫尔达伊与无死角议员协商。因此，虽然有一些文化上的分歧，但他们仍然忠于Aerenal的基本原则，认为自己是Aereni。而最重要的是，瓦尔拉亚系的海精灵有可能成为无死亡者。瓦尔瑞亚保护局里有不死的海精灵，他们是保护和指导人民的士兵和议员，还有一些古老的海精灵坐在沙伊-莫尔代的议会中。",
	"Some remarkable locathah and even sahuagin have been preserved as spirit idols, and these are held up as paragons to the common people; this is immortality you can attain! While the hope that a non-elf could become deathless has long been dangled in front of the people, it's never been done, and isn't something any elf believes is possible. However, the possibility is explored in Story Hooks later in this section.": "一些杰出的Locathah甚至sahuagin被保留下来作为精神偶像，这些人被作为普通人的典范；这是你们可以达到的不朽！\"。虽然非精灵可以成为不死之身的希望长期以来一直在人们面前晃来晃去，但它从未被做到过，也没有任何精灵认为这是可能的。然而，这种可能性在本节后面的故事钩子中得到了探讨。",
	"The Valrean Protectorate extends approximately 150 miles from the coast of Aerenal. Within this radius, the Undying Court wields great power; it can control the weather and produce other dramatic environmental effects. As a result, the Protectorate truly seems a blessed land; the waters are peaceful and the weather is beautiful. The Protectorate includes settlements along the shelf in the upper water and on the ocean floor.": "Valrean保护国从Aerenal的海岸延伸了大约150英里。在这个范围内，不死鸟法庭拥有强大的力量；它可以控制天气，并产生其他戏剧性的环境效果。因此，保护国似乎真的是一块受祝福的土地；水面平静，天气优美。保护国包括沿大陆架的上层水和海底的定居点。",
	"The Protectorate has fought many wars with the Eternal Dominion and its predecessors. Ultimately, the transcendental power of the Undying Court holds enemies at bay, but over thousands of years, the Protectorate has developed and fortified defenses on the border of their territory. A series of bone-coral towers stand along the front, connected by rune-lines—glowing patterns engraved in the sea-bed that help focus and channel the power of the Court when it is needed. The region contains {@i spirit mines}—floating ivory spheres that conjure angry ghosts into any ship that comes too close—and other defenses. All shipping is wise to follow the sanctioned routes for entry.": "保护国与永恒统治者及其前身进行了多次战争。最终，不朽之庭的超凡力量将敌人压制住了，但数千年来，保护国在其领土的边界上发展并加强了防御。一系列的骨质珊瑚塔矗立在前线，由刻在海床上的流线型图案连接，在需要时帮助集中和引导法院的力量。该地区有{@i spirit mines}--浮动的象牙球，可以将愤怒的鬼魂召唤到任何过于接近的船只上，还有其他防御措施。所有的航运都是明智的，要遵循批准的路线进入。",
	"The manifest zones in this region are mostly tied to Irian and Mabar. However, there are a few manifest zones tied to Lamannia, and those in the upper waters are prone to the violent surges seen in zones across the sea. While the Undying Court can contain these surges, this is an expenditure of energy on their part; as a result, the Valraeans welcome the merfolk of Karakala, whose rituals stabilize the zones.": "这个地区的显露区大多与伊里安和马巴尔相连。然而，也有一些与拉曼尼亚有关的显灵区，那些位于上层水域的显灵区很容易出现海面上的暴力浪潮。虽然不死鸟法庭可以控制这些浪潮，但这对他们来说是一种能量的消耗；因此，瓦拉伊人欢迎卡拉卡拉的人鱼，他们的仪式可以稳定这些区域。",
	"Valraeans of all species practice the same traditions as the elves of Aerenal. Though magic is widespread in the Protectorate, Valraean subjects aren't taught the higher arts, so the overall level of common magic is more on par with the Five Nations, with greater wonders seen in the coral palaces of the line of Valraea. The common populace of the Protectorate includes magewrights and adepts, with a handful of gifted wizards. While all subjects are taught to worship the Undying Court, the actual priests are sea elves.": "所有物种的Valraeans都奉行与Aerenal的精灵一样的传统。虽然魔法在保护国很普遍，但瓦拉恩人并没有被教授高级魔法，所以普通魔法的总体水平与五国相当，在瓦拉恩家族的珊瑚宫殿中可以看到更多的奇迹。保护国的普通民众包括魔法师和神职人员，还有少数有天赋的巫师。虽然所有的臣民都被教导要崇拜不死阁，但真正的祭司是海精灵。",
	"Sea elves of the line of Valraea typically focus on divine or arcane magic. The sea elves are encouraged to think of themselves as divine champions, and many do become clerics or paladins. Arcane spellcasters are typically wizards, and the strengths of the Protectorate are divination, abjuration, and necromancy. There are also a handful of artificers among the line. While the power of the Undying Court defends the region, the line of Valraea maintains the many wards and monitors the seas for sahuagin activity, or any other threat that might arise.": "瓦拉亚系的海精灵通常专注于神圣或奥术魔法。海精灵们被鼓励把自己当作神圣的冠军，许多人确实成为了牧师或圣骑士。奥术施法者通常是巫师，护国者的强项是占卜、咒语和死灵法术。他们中也有少数的工匠。当不死鸟法庭的力量保卫这个地区的时候，瓦拉伊亚的队伍维持着许多防护措施，并监视着海洋上的萨瓦金人活动，或任何其他可能出现的威胁。",
	"The artisans of the Protectorate work with the exotic woods of Aerenal, but they use other exotic materials as well. Leather is the primary material used in clothing, both fine, thin leather for simple fashions, and tougher hides for armor. Bone-coral is a form of coral that is artificially grown and hardened using arcane techniques, used for everything from buildings to ornaments. Bloodvines are an aquatic form of Aereni livewood; they draw sustenance from any creature in contact with them (though not so much as to be noticeable in any way) and thus remain alive, even when shaped into ornaments or armor.": "保护国的工匠们使用阿伦纳尔的奇异木材，但他们也使用其他奇异材料。皮革是用于服装的主要材料，既有用于简单时装的精细薄皮，也有用于盔甲的坚硬皮革。骨珊瑚是珊瑚的一种形式，是用奥术技术人工种植和硬化的，用于从建筑到装饰品的一切。血藤是一种水生形式的Aereni活木；它们从与它们接触的任何生物身上汲取养分（尽管没有多到以任何方式引起注意），因此保持活力，即使被塑造成装饰品或盔甲。",
	"The artificers of the line of Valraea are curious about the arcane potential of kar'lassa biomatter—the foundation of Dominion arcane magic—and are always eager to acquire it. Valraean sahuagin don't have access to the magebreeding and alchemical techniques of the Eternal Dominion; as a result, they develop as any other creatures would, instead of being guided down a particular path. This also means the Protectorate doesn't have any of the secondary mutants—such as barons, malenti, and Claws of Sha'argon—found in the Dominion.": "Valraea系的工匠们对kar'lassa生物物质的奥秘潜力感到好奇--这是统治者奥秘魔法的基础，他们总是渴望获得它。Valraean sahuagin没有机会接触到永恒主宰的魔法培育和炼金技术；因此，他们像其他生物一样发展，而不是被引导到一个特定的道路上。这也意味着保护国没有任何二级变异体--如男爵、马伦蒂和沙阿贡之爪--在统治国中发现。",
	"The Valraean Protectorate is an extension of Aerenal, and diplomacy with surface nations is conducted by the elves of the islands. Generally, the only time surface-dwellers encounter sea elves or Valraean subjects is at customs checkpoints when approaching Aerenal; thus, sailors may be familiar with them, but most people of the Five Nations have never seen a sea elf or a locathah. Aerenal takes the security of its coastal waters seriously, and ships must adhere to specific shipping lanes or risk running afoul of spirit mines and other traps.": "瓦拉恩保护国是阿伦纳尔的延伸，与地面国家的外交是由岛上的精灵进行的。一般来说，地表居民只有在接近爱伦纳尔时，才会在海关检查站遇到海精灵或瓦拉恩的臣民；因此，水手们可能对他们很熟悉，但五国的大多数人从未见过海精灵或Locathah。Aerenal对其沿海水域的安全非常重视，船只必须遵守特定的航道，否则就有可能触犯精神地雷和其他陷阱。",
	"Today, the Valraean Protectorate remains at a chilly impasse with the Eternal Dominion of the sahuagin, as Valraea strengthes its defenses and the Dominion works to place ever more malenti agents within the Protectorate. Both refused to engage in direct commerce or diplomacy with each other, though the Dominion allows Aereni vessels to use their shipping lanes (at a price). Karakala serves as an intermediary between the two, carrying messages and conducting simple trade.": "今天，Valraean保护国与sahuagin的Eternal Dominion仍然处于寒冷的僵局中，因为Valraea加强了防御，而Dominion则努力在保护国中安置更多的malenti特工。双方都拒绝与对方进行直接的商业或外交活动，但多米尼克允许Aereni船只使用他们的航道（有代价）。卡拉卡拉作为双方的中间人，负责传递信息和进行简单的贸易。",
	"Elves of the line of Valraea rarely leave the Protectorate. They have important duties to tend to, and issues in the surface world are generally dealt with by the elves of the island. However, the line of Valraea is devoted to the Undying Court, and an adventurer could be following a direct mandate either from the court itself or from a specific deathless sea elf. Such a character could use the sea elf racial traits from {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}; you might be a cleric using the Life or Knowledge domain, or a paladin following the Oath of the Ancients or the Oath of Devotion. In any case, this character would likely be proud; in your eyes, you're a celestial in the service of the divine.": "瓦雷亚系的精灵很少离开保护国。他们有重要的职责要做，表面世界的问题一般由岛上的精灵来处理。然而，瓦拉伊亚一系致力于不死之庭，一个冒险者可以遵循来自不死之庭本身或特定的无死之海精灵的直接授权。这样的角色可以使用{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}的海精灵种族特征；你可能是一个使用生命或知识领域的牧师，或者一个遵循古人之誓或奉献之誓的圣骑士。在任何情况下，这个角色都可能会感到骄傲；在你眼里，你是一个为神灵服务的天人。",
	"Or you might be a sea elf who questions the traditions of the Protectorate. Perhaps you feel that the Protectorate—and Aerenal as a whole—should be emulating the spirit of innovation of the Five Nations rather than just holding to Aereni arcane traditions. As an artificer or wizard, you could be determined to study as many other systems of magic as possible; you don't believe that the defenses of the Protectorate will hold forever, and you want to develop something new.": "或者你可能是一个对保护国的传统提出质疑的海精灵。也许你觉得保护国以及整个Aerenal应该效仿五国的创新精神，而不是仅仅坚持Aereni的奥术传统。作为一个工匠或魔法师，你可能决心尽可能多地研究其他的魔法系统；你不相信保护国的防御系统会永远存在，你想开发一些新的东西。",
	"Alternatively, you could play a locathah from the Valraean Protectorate (using the racial traits presented in {@adventure Locathah Rising|lr}). Locathah are all but unknown on Khorvaire. As a Valraean locathah, you have the benefits of Aereni education, and may have adopted many elf mannerisms. Are you a proud champion of your nation and a loyal servant of the Undying Court? Or were you exiled after you opposed the Aereni oppression of your people? If so, are you acting in the interests of Valraean locathah now? Do you want to find a way for your people to develop their own deathless? Or are you following your own path in the world, leaving the Protectorate in your wake?": "另外，你可以扮演瓦拉恩保护国的Locathah（使用{@adventure Locathah Rising|lr}中介绍的种族特征）。Locathah在Khorvaire几乎无人知晓。作为一个Valraean locathah，你有Aereni教育的好处，并且可能已经采用了许多精灵的举止。你是你的国家的骄傲冠军和不朽宫廷的忠诚仆人吗？还是因为你反对艾瑞尼人对你的人民进行压迫而被流放？如果是的话，你现在是在为瓦拉恩-洛塔哈的利益而行动吗？你想为你的人民找到一条发展他们自己的无死亡的道路吗？还是说你在这个世界上走自己的路，把保护国留在你的身后？",
	"The line of Valraea are the sea elves of the Thunder Sea, but they aren't the only sea elves in Eberron. If you want to play a sea elf but don't want ties to the oppressive Protectorate, there are two additional options you can explore.": "瓦拉亚一系是雷海的海精灵，但他们并不是Eberron中唯一的海精灵。如果你想扮演海精灵，但又不想与压迫性的保护国联系在一起，有两个额外的选择，你可以探索。",
	"The Valraean Protectorate guards the Thunder Sea and holds the line between Aerenal and the Thunder Sea. But that's not the only aquatic border of Aerenal. Along the eastern coastline, the elves of the line of Maraen are the sentinels of the Dragonreach. This isn't a colony, but rather, a military operation. In the wake of the last draconic incursion, Valraeans were conscripted to serve the Maraen line, but in the Dragonreach, they're not subjects, but soldiers and equals. Here, Maraen sea elves scout and fight alongside sahuagin and locathah. They hold firmly to the meritocratic principles that underlie Aerenal, and have formally adopted some of their non-elf soldiers into the line. They have yet to nominate a non-elf for admission into the Undying Court, but it's certainly a path they may pursue.": "瓦拉恩护卫队守卫着雷海，坚守着阿伦纳尔和雷海之间的界限。但这并不是Aerenal唯一的水上边界。沿着东部的海岸线，马拉恩一系的精灵们是Dragonreach的哨兵。这不是一个殖民地，而是一个军事行动。在上一次龙人入侵之后，瓦拉伊人被征召为马拉恩系服务，但在龙之谷，他们不是臣民，而是士兵和平等的人。在这里，马拉恩海精灵与萨瓦金人和洛萨塔人一起侦查和战斗。他们坚定地坚持艾瑞纳的择优录取原则，并正式将一些非精灵士兵纳入该系。他们还没有提名一个非精灵进入不朽之庭，但这肯定是他们可能追求的道路。",
	"The conflict between the Undying Court and the line of Vol shook Aerenal. While most of the line of Valraea were staunch supporters of the Undying Court, there were some among both Valraea and Maraen who saw the persecution of Vol as unjust and fought against their kin. After Vol was defeated, they went into exile with other supporters of the line, traveling north to the Lhazaar Principalities. A few dwell off the coast of Farlnen, where they have adopted the necromantic traditions of the Bloodsails. The rest followed their elf kin to Orthoss, where they are a proud part of the Wind Whisperer principality.": "不死鸟法庭和沃尔一系之间的冲突震撼了Aerenal。虽然大多数瓦拉亚家族都是不死阁的坚定支持者，但在瓦拉亚和马拉恩中都有一些人认为对沃尔的迫害是不公正的，并与他们的亲属进行斗争。沃尔被打败后，他们和其他的支持者一起流亡，向北走到拉扎尔公国。少数人居住在法尔南（Farlnen）的海岸边，他们在那里采用了血帆（Bloodsails）的亡灵传统。其余的人跟随他们的精灵亲属来到奥瑟斯，在那里他们是风语者公国的骄傲。",

	"The adventurers are on a ship that is drawn off course (by hijackers? a freak occurrence?) and runs afoul of Valraean defenses, crippling the vessel. The characters are rescued by a group of Valraean locathah who maintain a farm on the edge of a small island. While waiting for someone to retrieve them, the adventurers get to know these locathah... and perhaps discover a dangerous secret hidden on the tiny island.": "冒险家们乘坐的船偏离了航线（被劫持者劫持？这些人物被一群瓦拉安人救了出来，他们在一个小岛的边缘维持一个农场。在等待有人来救他们的时候，冒险家们认识了这些locathah......也许还发现了隐藏在小岛上的一个危险的秘密。",
	"A group of Valraean visionaries—locathah, sahuagin, and sympathetic sea elves—are determined to develop sahuagin or locathah deathless, their first step to establishing equality within the region. These revolutionaries are searching out scattered tombs that tie to the creation of deathless, along with artifacts that channel the power of Irian. Are their methods peaceful or violent? Will the adventurers assist them or oppose them?": "一群瓦拉因的幻想家--洛卡塔、萨瓦金和同情的海精灵--决心开发萨瓦金或洛卡塔无死角，这是他们在该地区建立平等的第一步。这些革命者正在寻找与创造无死角有关的散落的坟墓，以及能引导伊里安力量的文物。他们的方法是和平的还是暴力的？冒险家们将协助他们还是反对他们？",
	"To strengthen their support among the common people, the line of Valraea proclaims that a locathah hero has been raised to the Undying Court—the first non-elf to be admitted. But is this true, or is it a lie to placate the masses? The adventurers are hired to investigate, and if it's a hoax, to expose it. Are their patrons members of the locathah resistance, or might they be unknowingly working for the Eternal Dominion?": "为了加强他们在普通人中的支持，瓦拉亚的路线宣称，一位当地的英雄已经被提升到不朽之庭--第一个被接纳的非精灵。但这是真的吗？还是为了安抚群众的谎言？冒险家们被雇来调查，如果这是一个骗局，则要揭穿它。他们的赞助人是Locathah抵抗组织的成员，还是可能在不知不觉中为永恒统治者工作？",
	"The Protectorate is eager to tap the power and the potential of the kar'lassa, and the best candidate is Hal'thela—the kar'lassa bound to Thelanis. But the kar'lassa is deep behind enemy lines. Can the adventurers help find its location and lead a team there? Why do the sahuagin shun it? Is it simply that they can't control the capricious fey? Or is the entire region touched by a fey curse—something that must be lifted before anyone can explore it safely?": "保护国渴望开发卡拉萨的力量和潜力，而最好的人选是哈尔拉--与塞拉尼斯绑定的卡拉萨。但卡拉萨深入敌后。冒险家们能否帮助找到它的位置并带领团队前往？为什么萨瓦金人避开它？难道只是因为他们无法控制那些反复无常的精灵？还是整个地区都受到了费伊人的诅咒--在任何人都能安全地探索它之前，必须先解除诅咒？",
	"There are places where even sahuagin fear to swim. Like all the overlords, the Lurker in Shadow couldn't be destroyed, only imprisoned. It's bound in Khyber, deep below the center of the Thunder Sea. But there are passages to its prison spread across the region, in vast rifts and lightless tunnels. The servants of the Lurker linger in these places, building their strength and watching the world above.": "有些地方连萨瓦金人都害怕游泳。像所有的霸主一样，阴影中的潜伏者无法被摧毁，只能被囚禁。它被束缚在开伯尔，在雷海中心的深处。但是，在巨大的裂缝和无光的隧道中，有一些通往它的监狱的通道遍布整个地区。潜伏者的仆人们在这些地方徘徊，增强他们的力量，并观察上面的世界。",
	"The chief servants of the Lurker in Shadow are the aboleths. Though driven from the sea itself, they've maintained a shadow empire in the tunnels below the seabed. Across eras, they've collected their subjects—locathah, sahuagin, withered storm giants, people of the Five Nations stolen from their ships. Those aboleths with little interest in humanoids instead craft aberrations and monstrosities, like the chuul. While the aboleths have no direct ties to the Lords of Dust, there are fiends among their allies—shadow demons and other spirits created by the Lurker in Shadows.": "阴影中的潜伏者的主要仆人是aboleths。虽然他们被赶出了海洋本身，但他们在海床下的隧道里维持着一个影子帝国。在不同的时代，他们收集了他们的臣民--洛卡塔、萨瓦金、枯萎的风暴巨人、从船上偷来的五国人民。那些对人类兴趣不大的boleths反而会制作畸形和怪胎，比如楚尔人。虽然boleths与尘土领主没有直接联系，但他们的盟友中也有恶魔--阴影恶魔和其他由阴影中的潜伏者创造的精神。",
	"The aboleths also possess untold riches and powerful artifacts from the Age of Demons—tools they can use to arm their allies, or to motivate with greed and bribery when direct mental domination isn't an option. The aboleths have risen en masse in the past, bringing down previous civilizations, fomenting war between the sahuagin and the giants. There have been dark centuries where the aboleths have ruled the sea—though these days were long before the rise of Galifar, and humanity knows little about the threat.": "aboleths还拥有数不清的财富和来自恶魔时代的强大文物--他们可以用这些工具来武装他们的盟友，或者在无法直接进行精神统治时用贪婪和贿赂来进行激励。Aboleths在过去曾大规模崛起，摧毁了以前的文明，在萨瓦金人和巨人之间煽动战争。曾经有几个黑暗的世纪，aboleths统治着大海--尽管这些日子早在加利法尔崛起之前就已经存在，而且人类对这种威胁知之甚少。",
	"Today, the aboleths are spread across the ocean, and it's up to the DM to decide how powerful they are. Are they a hidden empire preparing to shake the world? Or are there just a few in hiding, preying on forgotten fishing villages and stealing thralls from shipwrecks? Consider the following ideas.": "今天，阿波利斯人分布在大洋彼岸，他们有多强大，就看DM的决定了。他们是一个准备撼动世界的隐藏帝国吗？还是只有少数人躲在暗处，掠夺被遗忘的渔村，从沉船上偷取鲛人？请考虑以下想法。",
	"A new wave of piracy spreads across the trade lanes in the vicinity of Stormreach. The villain is Red Daskia, a Cloudreaver captain from the Lhazaar Principalities. But she has fiendish allies and artifacts from the Age of Demons that let her vessel outrun even Lyrandar vessels and disappear in fog. When the adventurers finally confront the pirate queen, it becomes clear that she's merely the agent of an aboleth mastermind; can the characters stop the true villain?": "一股新的海盗浪潮在暴风城附近的贸易通道上蔓延开来。恶棍是红色的达斯基亚，一个来自拉扎尔公国的猎云者船长。但她有邪恶的盟友和来自恶魔时代的神器，让她的船甚至能超过Lyrandar的船只，并在雾中消失。当冒险家们最终与海盗女王对峙时，很明显，她只是一个aboleth主谋的代理人；这些角色能阻止真正的恶棍吗？",

An aboleth has seized control of a Dominion outpost and is seeking to cause conflict between the Dominion and the surface; it might also stage dryskin attacks on Dominion bases. Can the adventurers get to the bottom of it?": "冒险家们陷入了似乎是多米尼克对一个沿海社区或和平船只的攻击中。一个阿波利斯人夺取了一个多米尼克前哨的控制权，并试图引起多米尼克和地面之间的冲突；它还可能对多米尼克的基地发动干皮攻击。冒险家们能查出真相吗？",
	" A cabal of aboleths have gained control of the leaders of Hal'shavar. They use this power to foment unrest across the Dominion, turning city against city.

Can the adventurers end this civil war?": " 一个阴谋集团获得了对Hal's shavar领导人的控制权。他们利用这种力量在整个统治区煽动动乱，使城市与城市之间发生冲突。这些冲突可能会蔓延到和平的旅行者身上；一次大规模的攻击甚至会影响到沙恩或Stormreach。这可能会导致整个多米尼克的崩溃吗？起初，冒险者们只遇到了冲突的副作用，直到一位研究德拉贡预言的学生意识到，如果多米尼克崩溃，阴影中的潜伏者就会被释放。冒险家们能结束这场内战吗？",
	"The sky was full of dreams. Countless points of light glittered against the endless darkness. But these were no stars. Some were quite close to Dela, and she could see them more clearly. There was movement within each iridescent sphere, images of people and places from across the world. In one, she could see a child begging on the streets of Sharn. In another, a woman was being crowned, surrounded by cheering people. Dela knew that if she touched one of these spheres, she would enter the dream, experiencing it just as if it was real. If she could find Rusty's dreams, she could speak to him. Try to save him. But how could she find one dream among the endless multitude?": "天空中充满了梦想。无数的光点在无尽的黑暗中闪闪发光。但这些都不是星星。有些离德拉很近，她可以更清楚地看到它们。每个彩虹色的球体中都有运动，是世界各地的人和地方的图像。在一个球体中，她可以看到一个孩子在沙恩的街头乞讨。在另一个中，一个女人正在加冕，周围是欢呼的人群。德拉知道，如果她触摸到这些球体中的一个，她就会进入梦境，体验它，就像它是真的一样。如果她能找到拉斯蒂的梦，她就能和他说话。试图拯救他。但她怎么能在无尽的众多梦境中找到一个梦呢？",
	"It was then that she saw the shadow moving against the darkness. Its body was nearly invisible against the sky, but it was surrounded by a halo of glowing eyes. Gentle had warned Dela about these. Each eye was the essence of a mortal; its dreams had been consumed by the kalaraq and its soul bound to service. And now, it was searching for her.": "就在这时，她看到那个黑影在黑暗中移动。它的身体在天空中几乎看不见，但它被一圈发亮的眼睛所包围。温柔曾警告过德拉关于这些。每只眼睛都是一个凡人的精华；它的梦想已经被卡拉OK吞噬，它的灵魂被束缚在服务中。而现在，它正在寻找她。",
	"All mortals are connected on a spiritual level to Eberron's thirteen planes. This is most obvious with Dal Quor and Dolurrh. When (most) creatures sleep, their spirits are drawn to Dal Quor, where their dreams take shape. When creatures die, their souls are pulled to Dolurrh. These facts are obvious and indisputable. But many people don't realize that just like their spirits are pulled by Dolurrh and Dal Quor, they're similarly tied to all of the planes. A storyteller might be inspired by Thelanis without ever knowing it, while an artist's revelation may come from Xoriat, and a soldier's courage could flow from Shavarath. The basic energy of life itself flows into the world from Irian, while Mabar consumes both life and hope. These forces are everywhere, as much a part of the soul as gravity is part of the world.": "所有的凡人都在精神层面上与Eberron的13个位面相连。这一点在达尔-库尔和多鲁尔最为明显。当（大多数）生物睡觉时，他们的灵魂会被吸引到达尔库尔，在那里他们的梦境会成形。当生物死亡时，他们的灵魂会被拉到Dolurrh。这些事实是显而易见、无可争议的。但许多人没有意识到，就像他们的灵魂被Dolurrh和Dal Quor所牵引一样，他们也同样与所有的平面联系在一起。一个讲故事的人可能在不知不觉中受到Thelanis的启发，而一个艺术家的启示可能来自Xoriat，而一个士兵的勇气可能来自Shavarath。生命本身的基本能量从伊里安流入世界，而马巴尔则同时吞噬了生命和希望。这些力量无处不在，就像重力是世界的一部分一样，是灵魂的一部分。",

Each of these thirteen planes have qualities of both Inner and Outer Planes as defined in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and affect the Material Plane in subtle and obvious ways. In addition to the constant influence of the planes on each creature, planes can also affect the world more directly, as seen in manifest zones and coterminous periods.": "Eberron的13个存在位面包含了Eberron本身的物质位面。虽然艾伯伦是一个更广泛的多元宇宙的一部分，但它完全被切断了，有自己独特的宇宙学。这十三个位面中的每一个都具有{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中定义的内位面和外位面的特质，并以微妙和明显的方式影响物质位面。除了平面对每个生物的持续影响外，平面也能更直接地影响世界，如在显化区和同位素时期所见。",
	"The most important thing to understand about the planes is that they're {@i ideas}. Each one is a pure, iconic concept. War. Peace. Chaos. Order. They are eternal, and with few exceptions, unchanging. Eberron is the Material Plane, where these concepts come together and interact. It's a world that feels the passage of time, where life can change and evolve. The planes of Eberron are archetypal ideas. The precise details can change, but there's always been war in Shavarath, and always will be; that's what Shavarath is.": "要了解这些飞机最重要的一点是，它们是（%0%）。每一架都是一个纯粹的、标志性的概念。战争。和平。混乱。秩序。它们是永恒的，而且除了少数例外，是不变的。Eberron是物质世界，这些概念在这里聚集并相互作用。这是一个能感受到时间流逝的世界，在这里生命可以改变和进化。Eberron的各个平面是典型的概念。准确的细节可以改变，但在沙瓦拉斯一直有战争，而且永远会有；这就是沙瓦拉斯。",
	"If adventurers visit one of the planes, they'll find it has certain unnatural properties that can be felt consistently throughout the entire plane of existence. A plane's universal properties can often be felt on Eberron itself; one of the most common effects of manifest zones is to extend one or more of that plane's universal properties into the Material Plane, sometimes reliably, other times unpredictably. The section for each plane presents a list of universal effects that affect that entire plane; these generally apply to all creatures within that plane.": "如果冒险者访问其中一个位面，他们会发现它具有某些非自然的属性，可以在整个存在位面中持续感受到。一个位面的普遍属性往往可以在Eberron本身感受到；显化区最常见的效果之一是将该位面的一种或多种普遍属性延伸到物质界，有时是可靠的，有时是不可预测的。每个位面的章节都列出了影响整个位面的普适效果；这些效果通常适用于该位面的所有生物。",
	"Time doesn't pass at the same rate on every plane; it could move faster, slower, or even unpredictably. For spells and similar effects that target oneself or require concentration, the duration is calculated based on the flow of time the caster is currently experiencing. If a spell doesn't require concentration and is cast on a target other than self (for example, a {@spell geas} spell), its duration is based on the target's current plane and time.": "时间在每个平面上的流逝速度并不一样；它可能更快、更慢，甚至是不可预测的。对于针对自己或需要集中注意力的法术和类似效果，持续时间是根据施法者当前经历的时间流速计算的。如果一个法术不需要集中注意力，并且是对自己以外的目标施放的（例如，{@spell geas}法术），其持续时间是基于目标的当前平面和时间。",
	"Every plane's inhabitants are unique, but each creature can generally be classified in one of the following categories.": "每个平面的居民都是独特的，但每个生物一般都可以归入以下类别之一。",
	"A dragon rains fire down on a platoon of soldiers in Shavarath. Cheering crowds throng the streets of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Dragon, soldiers, crowds—none of these things are truly real. When you dream that you're taking a test at Arcanix, the sarcastic professor and mocking students aren't fully sentient spirits; they're manifestations of Dal Quor, created for that scene, and as soon as you wake, they'll vanish. These creatures can appear to be sentient, and you might be able to have a conversation with soldiers in Shavarath—but they won't have anything to say that you couldn't imagine coming out of the mouth of an extra in a war movie. As a general rule, manifestations can't leave the layers of the planes that they're in, and like dreams, they usually don't persist indefinitely; when their purpose is served, they simply evaporate until they're needed again. Very rarely, a manifestation might develop a more independent, sentient existence—like the drifters of Dal Quor—though they're generally still bound to their plane of origin and unable to deviate from their central purpose.": "一条龙向沙瓦拉特的一排士兵倾泻火焰。欢呼的人群拥挤在伊里安的阿马兰斯城的街道上。龙、士兵、人群--这些东西都不是真正的真实。当你梦见自己在阿卡尼克斯参加考试时，讽刺的教授和嘲笑的学生并不是完全有知觉的精神；他们是达尔-库尔的表现，为那个场景而创造，一旦你醒来，他们就会消失。这些生物可以看起来是有知觉的，你也许可以和沙瓦拉斯的士兵进行对话--但他们不会有任何你无法想象的、从战争电影中的临时演员口中说出的话语。一般来说，显灵不能离开它们所在的飞机层，而且像梦一样，它们通常不会无限期地存在；当它们的目的达到后，它们会简单地蒸发，直到再次需要它们。极少数情况下，一个显现体可能会发展出更独立的、有生命的存在，就像达尔-库尔的漂流者一样，尽管他们通常仍被束缚在他们的起源平面，无法偏离他们的中心目的。",
	"Manifestations vary by plane; in Dal Quor they're called figments, while in Shavarath, they're conscripts. In some planes, the manifestations are formed from the soul-stuff of mortals, while in others they're entirely imaginary. A plane never runs out of the potential for manifestations, but these creatures typically follow the internal logic of a scene. If you fight a dragon in Shavarath, it feels just like fighting an actual dragon, and when you kill it, it seems dead and you can enjoy your victory. However, if you return a day later, there's no sign of the corpse, and instead, there's a new dragon in the sky.": "表现形式因位面而异；在Dal Quor，他们被称为虚影，而在Shavarath，他们是征召者。在某些位面，显现物是由凡人的灵魂物质形成的，而在其他位面，它们完全是想象出来的。一个位面永远不会耗尽显灵的潜力，但这些生物通常遵循一个场景的内部逻辑。如果你在沙瓦拉斯与龙战斗，感觉就像与一条真正的龙战斗，当你杀死它时，它似乎已经死了，你可以享受你的胜利。然而，如果你一天后再回来，就没有尸体的迹象了，相反，天空中出现了一条新的龙。",
	"Some planes don't have manifestations of creatures, because the ideas they represent don't need them. Instead, these planes generally rely on native mortals to make up the supporting cast. So while Shavarath needs a constant churn of conscripts in battle, and Dal Quor creates figments to flesh out mortal dreams, other planes—Dolurrh, Fernia, Lamannia, and Syrania—don't create manifestations. For example, Lamannia needs mortal beasts to tell its story; birth, growth, and even death are part of its concept, and reflecting that requires a mortal population.": "有些位面没有生物的表现，因为它们所代表的思想不需要它们。相反，这些星球通常依靠本地凡人来组成配角。因此，虽然沙瓦拉斯在战斗中需要不断地征召新兵，达尔-库尔创造了一些形象来充实凡人的梦境，但其他星球--多勒尔、费尔尼亚、拉曼尼亚和西拉尼亚--并没有创造显灵。例如，拉曼尼亚需要凡人的野兽来讲述它的故事；出生、成长、甚至死亡都是它的概念的一部分，而反映这一点需要一个凡人的人口。",
	"Immortal beings are an integral part of their native plane, each expressing a particular aspect of its core ideas. For example, in Shavarath, devils embody the concept of war fought in pursuit of tyranny, while angels are living symbols of the endless fight for justice. The name \"immortal\" doesn't mean \"unkillable\"—they can indeed be killed (as discussed in the \"Killing Immortals\" sidebar). While immortals don't show the effects of age, some have a limited lifespan and can die a natural death as well. However, their {@i essence} is immortal and their numbers remain constant.": "不朽的生命是其本位面的一个组成部分，每个人都表达了其核心思想的一个特定方面。例如，在沙瓦拉斯，魔鬼体现了为追求暴政而进行的战争的概念，而天使则是为正义而进行的无尽斗争的活生生的象征。\"不朽 \"这个名字并不意味着 \"不可杀死\"--他们确实可以被杀死（正如在 \"杀死不朽者 \"边栏中所讨论的）。虽然不朽者不会显示出年龄的影响，但有些人的寿命有限，也可以自然死亡。然而，他们的（%0%）是不朽的，他们的数量保持不变。",
	"Most immortals don't care about Eberron. Many consider Eberron to be an unfinished experiment, while their realm is the finished, perfected work of the Progenitors. Others simply believe in their purpose to the exclusion of all other things; to the angel of Shavarath, the eternal battle is the single most important struggle in the multiverse, and leaving their post for even an instant could give the enemy an advantage. So most immortals aren't concerned with the fates of mortals or their civilizations; of course mortals may die, that's their most defining feature. An angel has seen many human civilizations rise and fall—what's one more? While there are a few exceptions—immortals who chose to dwell on Eberron, whether to prey on mortals, observe them, or assist them—immortals are generally bound to their planes, and your problems are not their problems.": "大多数不朽者并不关心Eberron。许多人认为Eberron是一个未完成的实验，而他们的领域是祖先们完成的、完美的作品。还有一些人只是相信他们的目的，而不是其他的东西；对沙瓦拉斯的天使来说，永恒的战斗是多元宇宙中唯一最重要的斗争，而离开他们的岗位哪怕是一瞬间都会给敌人带来优势。所以大多数不朽者并不关心凡人或其文明的命运；当然，凡人可能会死亡，这是他们最明确的特征。一个天使已经看到许多人类文明的兴起和衰落--再多一个又算得了什么？虽然有一些例外--选择居住在Eberron的不朽者，无论是捕食凡人，观察他们，还是帮助他们--不朽者一般都被束缚在他们的星球上，你的问题不是他们的问题。",
	"Immortals don't reproduce as mortal creatures do; if they're killed, their spiritual essence is instead reabsorbed into the plane and eventually reassembled. For example, in Shavarath, angels and devils are constantly being killed, but they're just as quickly being reborn to fight again. Immortals are each born as embodiments of specific ideas and don't choose their path; they're already mature, possessing their full abilities and knowledge, and imbued with an absolute understanding of their purpose. So while immortals possess great power, they lack the potential of mortals to grow and evolve, and find the idea of questioning their beliefs or straying from their purpose to be inconceivable.": "不朽者不会像凡间生物那样繁殖；如果他们被杀，他们的精神本质反而会被重新吸收到飞机上，最终重新组合。例如，在Shavarath，天使和魔鬼不断被杀死，但他们同样很快就会重生，再次战斗。不朽者生来就是特定理念的化身，他们不选择自己的道路；他们已经成熟，拥有全部的能力和知识，并被灌输了对其目的的绝对理解。因此，虽然不朽者拥有强大的力量，但他们缺乏凡人成长和进化的潜力，并发现质疑他们的信仰或偏离他们的目的的想法是不可想象的。",
	"Killing an immortal being is a temporary solution. Immortals that play a particularly significant role within a plane often return with their memories and personality intact; physical destruction is no more than a short trip to the penalty box. Lesser immortals may return with the same abilities, but with a new appearance, memories, or personality. The number of immortals remains the same, but it's a new incarnation of the idea. The only way to permanently eliminate an immortal is to somehow contain or redirect its spiritual essence; this is why the Silver Flame bound the overlords instead of destroying them.": "杀死一个不朽的生命是一个暂时的解决办法。在一个平面内扮演特别重要角色的不朽者通常会带着他们的记忆和人格完好无损地回来；身体上的破坏不过是去罚站的短途旅行而已。较小的不朽者可能带着同样的能力回来，但有新的外观、记忆或个性。不朽者的数量保持不变，但这是一个新的想法的化身。永久消除不朽者的唯一方法是以某种方式遏制或重定向其精神本质；这就是为什么银色火焰束缚了霸主而不是摧毁他们。",
	"While immortals can't be destroyed, it's possible that the manner of a creature's death, or circumstances that follow, could delay the return of a particular immortal, or force it to return as a new incarnation instead of retaining its memories. The DM could choose to make these general rules for a type of creature—perhaps immortals from Shavarath return in 24 hours if they're killed on Shavarath, but it takes 6 months for them to return if they're killed on Eberron. Or it could be extremely specific: the devil Hashtorak returns within a day of his death, but if he's killed with the Spear of Miron he'll be banished for ten years.": "虽然不朽者不能被摧毁，但一个生物的死亡方式或随后发生的情况有可能延迟某个不朽者的回归，或者迫使它以新的化身回归，而不是保留其记忆。DM可以选择为某种类型的生物制定这些一般规则--也许来自Shavarath的不朽者如果在Shavarath被杀，他们会在24小时内返回，但如果他们在Eberron被杀，则需要6个月才能返回。或者可以非常具体：恶魔Hashtorak在死亡后一天内返回，但如果他被米隆之矛杀死，他将被放逐十年。",
	"There are exceptions to all rules, of course. The kalashtar exist because a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar. Likewise, radiant idols are angels of Syrania that were corrupted by their time on the Material Plane and desired mortal adoration. But these examples are vanishingly rare. Sometimes it's because the unusual immortal is born embodying a unique perspective on the usual concept; this is essentially a mutation, as opposed to a choice. In other cases, an outside force might change or corrupt the immortal's fundamental nature. And rarely, an immortal might have an unusual sense of identity and the ability to choose.": "当然，所有规则都有例外。卡拉什塔的存在是因为一小撮科里人背叛了伊尔-拉什塔瓦。同样地，光芒四射的偶像是西拉尼亚的天使，他们被物质界的时间所腐蚀，渴望得到凡人的崇拜。但这些例子都消失得很罕见。有时是因为不寻常的不朽者出生时体现了对通常概念的独特观点；这本质上是一种突变，而不是一种选择。在其他情况下，一种外部力量可能会改变或腐蚀不朽者的基本性质。而在极少数情况下，一个不朽者可能会有一种不寻常的身份感和选择能力。",
	"If an immortal changes in a way that alters its core concept, this is often accompanied by a physical transformation, such as a corrupted angel becoming a radiant idol, thus losing its ability to fly. Immortals may be able to increase their abilities by absorbing other immortals, acquiring artifacts, or through other means unique to their plane. They simply don't grow or gain experience through time alone; after all, some of them are as old as the universe itself, and in the absence of a dramatic cause, they're utterly unchanging.": "如果一个不朽者的变化改变了它的核心概念，这往往伴随着身体的转变，比如一个被腐蚀的天使变成了一个有光芒的偶像，从而失去了飞行的能力。不朽者可能会通过吸收其他不朽者、获得神器或通过其所在位面特有的其他手段来增加他们的能力。他们根本不会仅仅通过时间来成长或获得经验；毕竟，他们中的一些人和宇宙本身一样古老，而且在没有戏剧性的原因的情况下，他们是完全不变的。",
	"Mortal creatures live in the planes, but they're much like their counterparts in Eberron. They have families and children, and can live quiet lives or be driven by grand ambitions. Unlike manifestations and immortals, mortal creatures can evolve and change their ways, and of course, they can die. In some planes, mortals are either subjugated by immortals or voluntarily serve them; in others, they pursue their own paths. In some cases—such as the merfolk of Lamannia or the eladrin of Thelanis—these creatures are natives of their home plane, were created by it, and have always been a part of it. Others—such as the frost giants of Risia—originally came from the Material Plane and simply carved out a place in their new plane. These non-native mortals may have lived in the planes for many generations, but on a fundamental level, they aren't truly a part of it.": "凡人生物生活在这个星球上，但他们很像Eberron的同类。他们有家庭和孩子，可以过平静的生活，也可以被宏大的野心所驱使。与显灵者和不朽者不同，凡人生物可以进化并改变他们的方式，当然，他们也会死亡。在一些星球，凡人要么被仙人征服，要么自愿为他们服务；在其他星球，他们追求自己的道路。在某些情况下，比如拉曼尼亚的人鱼族或塞拉尼斯的艾拉德林，这些生物是他们母体位面的本地人，由它创造，并且一直是它的一部分。其他人，比如里西亚的冰霜巨人，最初来自物质界，只是在他们的新位面开辟了一个位置。这些非本土的凡人可能已经在这个位面生活了很多代，但从根本上说，他们并不是真正的位面的一部分。",
	"The same type of creature can appear in different planes—demons can be found in Fernia, Dolurrh, Shavarath, and more. They might use the same statistics, but their appearance and motivations vary dramatically based on their planes, and they have no sense that being \"demons\" makes them all allies. The balor of Shavarath embodies the savagery of war; its wings are of steel, and blood drips from its notched sword. The balor of Fernia represents the terrifying destructive power of fire; its wings and sword are made of pure flame. With any planar creature—especially immortals—consider the idea it represents and how that can be uniquely embodied.": "同一类型的生物可以出现在不同的位面--恶魔可以在费尔尼亚、多鲁尔、沙瓦拉斯等位面找到。他们可能使用相同的统计数据，但他们的外表和动机根据他们的位面有很大的不同，而且他们没有意识到作为 \"恶魔 \"使他们成为所有的盟友。沙瓦拉斯的巴洛体现了战争的野蛮；它的翅膀是钢制的，血从它的缺口的剑上滴下来。费尔尼亚的巴洛代表了火的可怕的破坏力；它的翅膀和剑是由纯火焰制成的。对于任何平面生物--特别是不死生物--要考虑它所代表的理念以及如何独特地体现出来。",
	"Eberron is the Material Plane, bound by the logical limitations that govern material things. However, its thirteen planes are ideas, and these are potentially limitless. With this in mind, the planes of Eberron are divided into layers—distinct environments or realms that aren't bound by the laws of physical space nor physically connected. These layers can be tiny, seemingly infinite, or anything in between. A desert may wrap back upon itself, the alleys in a city could twist in impossible ways to always return you to the main square, or you could come to an absolute edge, where everything falls away into an endless void.": "Eberron是物质位面，受到支配物质事物的逻辑限制的约束。然而，它的13个位面是理念，而这些理念可能是无限的。考虑到这一点，Eberron的各个平面被划分为不同的层次--不受物理空间法则的约束，也没有物理联系的不同环境或境界。这些层可以是微小的，也可以是无限的，或者是介于两者之间的任何东西。一片沙漠可能会自相缠绕，一座城市的小巷可能会以不可能的方式扭曲，让你总是回到主广场，或者你可能会来到一个绝对的边缘，在那里一切都会落入一个无尽的虚空。",
	"Many scholars—including Dorius Alyre ir'Korran in his celebrated {@i Planar Codex}—describe the layers of a plane as a stack; however, the planes of Eberron aren't physically arranged in a particular order, and there's no concept of a top or bottom layer. Instead, each layer explores a different facet of the core concept that defines the plane. Lamannia is the Plane of Nature, and each layer showcases a particular environment—there's an endless ocean, a vast forest, a volcano forever on the edge of erupting. Shavarath is the Plane of War, and each layer contains a different aspect of war—a bitter siege, a bloody melee, a lingering guerilla conflict. Some planes have a core layer that serves as the heart of the plane, such as the Amaranthine Cities of Mabar and Irian. But the layers of Lamannia are all equal in importance.": "许多学者--包括Dorius Alyre ir'Korran在他著名的{@i Planar Codex}中--将一个平面的层次描述为一个堆叠；然而，Eberron的平面在物理上并没有按照特定的顺序排列，也没有顶层或底层的概念。相反，每一层都探讨了定义该平面的核心概念的不同方面。拉曼尼亚是自然界的平面，每一层都展示了一个特定的环境--有无尽的海洋、广阔的森林、永远处于喷发边缘的火山。Shavarath是战争平面，每一层都包含了战争的不同方面--痛苦的围攻、血腥的混战、挥之不去的游击冲突。有些位面有一个核心层，作为位面的核心，例如马巴尔和伊里安的亚马逊城市。但拉曼尼亚的各层在重要性上都是一样的。",
	"While they aren't stacked, most planes have layers bound by a reliable set of connections. The shape of these connections varies based on the plane. Some are obvious: a massive door sitting in the desert, a pool that reflects a scene from another layer. Others are more subtle; if you come upon an island while sailing on the Endless Ocean of Lamannia and you walk inland, you'll find that the island is a completely different layer—and when you turn around, the ocean is no longer behind you. A portal doesn't have to be physical at all; in Thelanis, you can travel to a new layer by acting out the elements of a new story.": "虽然它们不是堆叠的，但大多数平面都有被一组可靠的连接所约束的层。这些连接的形状根据平面的不同而不同。有些是显而易见的：一扇坐在沙漠中的巨大的门，一个反映另一层场景的水池。其他的则更加微妙；如果你在拉曼尼亚的无尽海洋上航行时遇到了一个岛屿，你向内陆走去，你会发现这个岛屿是一个完全不同的层--当你转身时，海洋已经不在你身后。传送门根本不一定是实体的；在Thelanis，你可以通过表演一个新故事的元素来旅行到一个新的层次。",
	"This chapter provides examples of notable layers for each plane, but these are only a sampling. Just as ideas have no limits, there are no limits on the number of layers a plane can contain. In developing or describing a layer to fit your story, keep the core concept of the plane in mind. What differentiates the vast fortress citadel of Irian's Amaranthine City from a fortress in Shavarath? A fortress in Shavarath is about war; the stones are worn, and there's a scent of blood and smoke in the air. In Irian, the fortress is a symbol of hope, of an empire on the rise; it's bright, clean, and may have never seen an actual battle. So while the layers of two planes might initially sound similar, look back to the core concept and consider how that's reflected in each layer.": "本章为每个平面提供了值得注意的层的例子，但这些只是一个样本。就像想法没有限制一样，一个平面可以包含的层数也没有限制。在开发或描述一个适合你的故事的层时，要牢牢记住平面的核心概念。伊里安的阿玛兰辛城的巨大堡垒要塞与沙瓦拉斯的堡垒有什么不同？沙瓦拉斯的堡垒是关于战争的；石头被磨损了，空气中弥漫着血和烟的气味。在伊里安，要塞是希望的象征，是一个正在崛起的帝国；它明亮、干净，而且可能从未见过一场真正的战斗。因此，虽然两个平面的层次最初可能听起来很相似，但回过头来看看核心概念，并考虑这如何反映在每一层中。",
	"Though travel to the planes is usually quite challenging and dangerous, even adventures on the world of Eberron can be profoundly impacted by the planes that lie beyond. This section discusses some unique aspects of the Material Plane and its place in the wider cosmology of Eberron.": "尽管前往各个位面的旅行通常是相当具有挑战性和危险性的，但即使是在艾伯伦世界中的冒险也会受到其他位面的深远影响。本节将讨论物质位面的一些独特之处，以及它在Eberron更广泛的宇宙学中的地位。",
	"Even without planar travel, there are many ways the planes can manifest in an adventure. This chapter examines these potential impacts for each plane using three general categories.": "即使没有平面旅行，飞机在冒险中也有许多表现方式。本章用三个一般的类别来研究每个飞机的这些潜在影响。",
	"These are places where the influence of a plane can be directly felt in the Material Plane. Each manifest zone is tied to a particular physical location on the Material Plane; this is true not only for the Eberron side of the zone, but for the region of the other plane it connects to. So if you live near a manifest zone to Thelanis, it always connects to a specific location in that plane; it's not simply a manifest zone to Thelanis, it's a manifest zone to a particular region of the Endless Weald (or any other layer of the plane).": "这些地方可以直接感受到一个位面在物质界的影响。每个显化区都与物质界的一个特定的物理位置相联系；这不仅适用于显化区的Eberron面，也适用于它所连接的其他位面的区域。因此，如果你住在通往Thelanis的显化区附近，它总是连接到该位面的一个特定位置；它不仅仅是通往Thelanis的显化区，也是通往无尽荒原（或该位面的任何其他层）的特定区域的显化区。",
	"Manifest zones often exhibit one or more of the universal properties of a plane; in a weak manifest zone, their effect might be diminished, and in a strong one, multiple effects might be present. Chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} suggests more possible features of manifest zones beyond those presented in this chapter. Some manifest zones can serve as direct portals between Eberron and another plane (though travel is blocked to Dal Quor and Xoriat). Most portals only open under certain circumstances—often when the planes are coterminous, when the moon associated with that plane is full, or both. These gateways can allow adventurers to travel to another plane—but can also be the source of unexpected, and sometimes hostile, creatures from other planes.": "显现区往往表现出一个或多个平面的普遍特性；在一个弱的显现区，它们的效果可能会减弱，而在一个强的显现区，可能会出现多种效果。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}的第四章提出了本章所介绍的以外的更多可能的显影区的特征。一些显化区可以作为Eberron和另一个位面之间的直接传送门（尽管前往Dal Quor和Xoriat的旅行被阻断）。大多数传送门只有在特定情况下才会打开--通常是在两个位面相邻的时候，或者与该位面相关的月亮满月的时候，或者两者都是。这些通道可以让冒险者前往另一个位面--但也可能是来自其他位面的意外、有时是敌对的生物的来源。",
	"Chapter 4 describes the kar'lassa, massive monstrosities that serve as living conduits to the planes. The kar'lassa are asleep, but they dream in planes other than Dal Quor, and mortal creatures that sleep in their vicinity are drawn into these dreams. Kar'lassa dreams exist as a unique layer within the plane, blending the plane's core principles with the alien consciousness of the dreamer; it's up to the DM to decide exactly how this manifests and how easy it is to reach other layers in the plane. Where the sahuagin have established a connection to a kar'lassa—as described in chapter 4—they've created a temple in its dreams, tended by dream priests.": "第四章描述了卡拉萨（kar'lassa），巨大的怪兽，作为通往各个星球的活体通道。卡拉萨是睡着的，但他们在达尔-库尔以外的其他星球上做梦，而在他们附近睡觉的凡人生物会被吸引到这些梦中。卡拉萨的梦境作为一个独特的层级存在于这个平面内，将平面的核心原则与做梦者的异己意识融合在一起；这取决于DM决定这到底是如何表现的，以及到达平面内其他层级的难度。在萨瓦金人已经与卡尔拉萨建立了联系的地方--如第4章所述--他们在其梦中创建了一座神庙，由梦中的祭司照看。",
	"The planes of Eberron are often depicted as orbiting the Material Plane, reflecting the fact that they move into and out of alignment with it. When a plane is {@i coterminous}, it's aligned; the plane's influence grows over the entire world, and it amplifies the effects of existing manifest zones. On the other hand, when a plane is {@i remote}, its power fades; since the planes are always influencing the Material in subtle ways, their absence impacts the world as strongly as their presence does. Multiple planes can be coterminous at the same time; these planar conjunctions are often related to the interactions of the moons, and characters proficient in Arcana can usually work out upcoming conjunctions.": "Eberron的各个位面经常被描述为围绕物质位面运行，这反映了它们与物质位面保持一致或不一致的事实。当一个平面是{@i coterminous}时，它就会被对齐；该平面的影响力会在整个世界范围内增长，并且会放大现有显化区的影响。另一方面，当一个平面是（%1%）时，它的力量就会减弱；因为平面总是以微妙的方式影响物质，它们的缺席对世界的影响与它们的存在一样强烈。多个位面可以同时出现；这些位面的结合通常与月亮的互动有关，精通奥术的人物通常可以算出即将到来的结合。",
	"These planar cycles are intended as plot devices, so DMs don't need to run them on strict calendar cycles. Instead, use them to suit the story. They can add an interesting mechanical twist to an adventure: because Mabar is coterminous, all undead are stronger! They can drive a villain's plot: {@i Lady Illmarrow must be stopped from activating the device in three days' time, when both Mabar and Dolurrh are coterminous—a conjunction that won't happen again for another century!}": "这些平面周期旨在作为情节装置，所以DM不需要在严格的日历周期上运行它们。相反，要根据故事的需要来使用它们。它们可以为冒险添加一个有趣的机械转折：因为马巴尔是同源的，所以所有的亡灵都更强大！它们可以推动反派的情节：（%0%）。它们可以推动反派的阴谋：{@i Lady Illmarrow must be stopped from activating the device in three days' time, when both Mabar and Dolurrh are coterminous—a conjunction that won't happen again for another century!}",
	"It's ultimately up to the DM to decide when planes are coterminous or remote. If it suits the story for Dolurrh to be remote for the next three days, make it so—just be sure to inform the arcane scholars among the adventurers, who'd likely know such a thing in advance. Other DMs might prefer to have concretely established cycles, which can add their own interesting flavor to an adventure. For example, Mabar is always coterminous on the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice, a time known as Long Shadows. On these nights, friends and family gather together and keep lights burning through the night. With this in mind, this chapter does discuss the traditional cycle of each plane, when it's reliably coterminous or remote—just remember the cycles are there to enhance your story, not limit it!": "最终要由DM来决定什么时候平面是相通的或遥远的。如果Dolurrh在接下来的三天里都是遥远的，那就这么做吧--只要确保通知冒险者中的奥术学者，他们可能会提前知道这样的事情。其他DM可能更喜欢有具体确定的周期，这可以为冒险增加自己的有趣的味道。例如，马巴尔总是在最接近冬至的新月之夜同日而语，这个时间被称为长影。在这些夜晚，朋友和家人聚集在一起，让灯光在夜里燃烧。考虑到这一点，本章确实讨论了每个平面的传统周期，当它可靠地同向或遥向时--只要记住周期是为了加强你的故事，而不是限制它！\"。",
	"The planes can be an excellent source of unusual materials, legendary magic items, and relics. Each section discusses a few kinds of items that could come from each plane and its associated manifest zones.": "平面可以是不寻常材料、传奇魔法物品和遗迹的绝佳来源。每一节都讨论了几种可能来自每个平面及其相关显化区的物品。",
	"In the myth of the Progenitors, Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber worked together to create the thirteen planes. Following this effort, they rested in the emptiness that lies at the center of the planes—and there, they quarreled.

	"This could be literal truth. Perhaps the ring in the sky was once the body of a great cosmic wyrm. But even if it's not literally true, it reflects truths about the world. From the surface, Eberron looks much like Earth; there is soil below your feet and moons and stars above. But the fact is that Eberron is {@i not} like Earth, and much of what can be seen isn't what it appears to be. As far as anyone has determined, Eberron is the sole planet in its Material Plane, and the fulcrum where the thirteen planes come together. Go below the surface of Eberron and you find not a molten core, but the demiplanes of Khyber. So what are the celestial bodies of Eberron?": "这可能是字面上的真相。也许天空中的戒指曾经是一个伟大的宇宙巫妖的身体。但即使它不是字面意义上的真实，它也反映了关于这个世界的真相。从表面上看，Eberron很像地球；你的脚下有土壤，上面有月亮和星星。但事实是，Eberron和地球一样（%0%），很多可以看到的东西并不是它看起来的那样。就任何人所确定的而言，Eberron是其物质位面中唯一的行星，也是13个位面汇聚在一起的支点。进入Eberron的表面之下，你发现的不是一个熔化的核心，而是Khyber的半平面。那么，Eberron的天体是什么？",

	"In the Progenitor myth, the three rested in the Material Plane after creating the planes. They created the sun, Arrah, much as mortals might kindle a campfire. This fire remained even after their battle, and continues to provide light, heat, and comfort to the world, functioning much like the sun we're used to in our own world. In the Sovereign Host, Dol Arrah is the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice; her name is, essentially, Warrior Sun.": "在始祖的神话中，三人在创造了各个平面后在物质界休息。他们创造了太阳，Arrah，就像凡人点燃篝火一样。这团火在他们的战斗之后仍然存在，并继续为世界提供光、热和舒适，其功能很像我们在自己的世界里所使用的太阳。在主宰者中，多尔-阿拉是太阳和牺牲的主宰者；她的名字本质上是勇士的太阳。",
	"There are stars in the sky of Eberron, but they aren't the anchors of distant solar systems. There are limits to the Material Plane, and the stars mark those limits; think of them as glittering points in a crystal sphere. The common constellations are figures of ancient dragons—Io, Tiamat, Chronepsis—though most people couldn't actually say where these names come from. It's generally assumed that they were handed down by one of the ancient kingdoms of Sarlona, or established by the ancestors of the Aereni—but in fact, the names are from a tradition spread by the sages of Argonnessen.": "Eberron的天空中有星星，但它们并不是遥远的太阳系的锚。物质世界是有界限的，而星星标志着这些界限；把它们想象成水晶球中的闪光点。常见的星座是古代龙的形象--伊欧、提亚马特、Chronepsis--尽管大多数人实际上无法说出这些名字的来源。人们普遍认为它们是由萨罗纳的某个古老王国传下来的，或者是由艾瑞尼的祖先建立的--但事实上，这些名字是由阿贡尼森的圣人传播的传统。",
	"Twelve orbiting moons are visible from Eberron—the former moon, Crya, hasn't been seen since ancient times, when tales say the empire of the giants destroyed it. Each moon goes through standard lunar phases, but during the month that shares its name, the moon enters an ascendant phase; during this time, the moon is brighter than usual. Each moon is associated with certain personality traits, and it's believed that people are influenced by the moon that's ascendant at the time of their birth. But there's a further complication, because the moons are also tied to the planes, as indicated on the Planar Destinations and Moons table. Each moon enters an additional ascendant phase whenever its associated plane is coterminous, and becomes unusually dim when the plane is remote. So while unusual, it's possible for there to be two or three ascendant moons at a time if multiple coterminous periods converge.": "从Eberron可以看到12个绕行的月亮--前一个月亮Crya自古以来就没有被看到过，当时的传说是巨人帝国摧毁了它。每个月亮都会经历标准的月相，但在与它同名的月份里，月亮会进入上升期；在这段时间里，月亮会比平时更亮。每个月亮都与某些个性特征有关，人们相信，人们会受到他们出生时上升星座的月亮的影响。但还有一个更复杂的问题，因为月亮也与星球有关，如星球目的地和月亮表所示。每一个月亮在其相关的平面是同向的时候都会进入一个额外的上升阶段，而当平面是遥远的时候就会变得异常的暗淡。因此，虽然不寻常，但如果多个同位素时期汇合，一次有可能出现两个或三个上升期的月亮。",
	"The connection between the planes and moons is reinforced by the fact that while on a plane, its associated moon is the only one that can be seen in the sky (though not all planar layers have a visible sky, like the dismal caverns of Dolurrh). While on a moon's associated plane, the phase of the moon doesn't necessarily match its current phase on Eberron. It may be fixed in a single phase—such as in Lamannia, where the moon is always full—or its phase might even change from layer to layer. While on a plane, if the moon is visible, it can be identified with a successful {@dc 10} Wisdom ({@skill Nature}) check.": "当在一个平面上时，其相关的月亮是唯一可以在天空中看到的月亮（虽然不是所有的平面都有可见的天空，比如多勒尔的阴暗洞穴），这一事实加强了平面与月亮之间的联系。虽然在月球的相关平面上，月相并不一定与它在Eberron上的当前相位一致。它可能固定在一个阶段--比如在拉曼尼亚，月亮总是满的，或者它的阶段甚至可能从一层到另一层发生变化。在一个平面上，如果月亮是可见的，可以通过成功的{@dc 10}智慧({@skill Nature})检查来识别它。",
	"To date, no humanoids have visited one of the moons. Because of this, their true nature remains a mystery. It's possible that they are orbiting, habitable planetoids, home to exotic creatures and valuable resources. But some sages believe that they aren't actually physical bodies at all, but rather, planar gateways—if an airship were to somehow fly high enough and attempt to land on a moon, perhaps it would instead pass into the sky of the associated plane. Determining the truth would be an epic adventure.": "迄今为止，还没有人类造访过其中一个卫星。正因为如此，它们的真实性质仍然是个谜。它们有可能是环绕的、可居住的行星，是奇异生物和宝贵资源的家园。但一些圣人认为，它们实际上根本不是物理体，而是平面通道--如果一艘飞艇以某种方式飞得足够高并试图在月球上降落，也许它反而会进入相关平面的天空。确定真相将是一场史诗般的冒险。",
	"The Sovereigns don't dwell in the planes, and the people of Eberron don't expect them to. Vassals of the Sovereign Host believe that the Sovereigns are everywhere at once. Onatar isn't working at a forge in Fernia, he's with every smith at {@i every} forge. Many Vassals believe that when mortal souls pass through Dolurrh, they join the Sovereigns, but this is seen more as an ecstatic union rather than joining them in an existential clubhouse.": "主权者并不居住在各个平面，Eberron的人们也不期望他们这样做。主权者的附庸们相信，主权者同时存在于各个地方。奥纳塔不是在费尔尼亚的一个锻造厂工作，他和每个铁匠都在{@i every}锻造厂。许多Vassals相信，当凡人的灵魂通过Dolurrh时，他们会加入Sovereigns，但这更多地被看作是一种狂喜的结合，而不是加入他们的生存会所。",
	"Some immortals in the planes honor the Sovereigns. A platoon of angels in Shavarath may carry the banner of Dol Arrah, while a squad of demons wear the skins of their foes and howl praise to the Mockery. The Librarian of Dolurrh may mention the time Aureon came to borrow a book—but that was almost a hundred thousand years ago. These acknowledgments don't prove anything, other than confirming the most basic myths of the Sovereign Host: that in the first age of the world, a band of champions defeated the overlords, as discussed in chapter 1. It's possible that they ascended and became the omnipresent entities many believe them to be, but that's the part that even angels must take on faith.": "各个位面中的一些不朽者向主宰者致敬。沙瓦拉斯的一排天使可能打着多尔-阿拉赫的旗帜，而一队恶魔则穿着他们敌人的皮毛，对嘲笑者发出赞美的嚎叫。多尔亚拉的图书管理员可能会提到奥瑞恩来借书的时间--但那几乎是十万年前的事了。这些承认并不能证明什么，只是证实了主宰者最基本的神话：在世界的第一个时代，一帮冠军击败了霸主，正如第一章中所讨论的那样。他们有可能升天并成为许多人认为的无所不在的实体，但这部分即使是天使也必须在信仰上接受。",
	"The Astral and Ethereal Planes are discussed in chapter 2 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The githyanki's vast ships can be found in the Astral Plane, as discussed in the section on Kythri.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的第二章中讨论了星界和虚空界的问题。githyanki的巨大飞船可以在星界找到，在关于Kythri的章节中讨论。",
	"It's possible that adventurers on either of these transitive planes may discover portals that lead back to the Material Plane or to twelve of Eberron's other planes; however, Dal Quor hasn't been accessible since the Age of Giants, and portals to this plane are impassable. The destination of Astral color pools and Ethereal curtains can be determined by their color; each portal closely resembles the appearance of the moon tied to that plane, as indicated in the {@table Planar Destinations and Moons|ExploringEberron} table.": "冒险者有可能在这些过渡位面中的任何一个发现通往物质位面或Eberron其他12个位面的传送门；然而，自巨人时代以来，Dal Quor就无法进入，通往这个位面的传送门是无法通行的。星空色池和虚无缥缈的窗帘的目的地可以通过它们的颜色来确定；每个传送门都与与该位面相连的月亮的外观非常相似，如{@table Planar Destinations and Moons|ExploringEberron}表中所示。",
	"Adventurers don't have to go beyond Eberron to find strange and magical realms. A layer of stone and soil lies beneath the surface of Eberron, and those who delve below may find natural caverns, subterranean ruins of Dhakaani goblinoids, or the realm of the dwarves of Sol Udar. But there's more to Khyber than rock and mud. The underdark contains countless demiplanes—pockets of space where the rules that govern the Material Plane don't apply. These are the source of Khyber's most unnatural aspects, where its fiends are formed and where the daelkyr remain imprisoned in their own layers (similar to the layers of Eberron's other planes). Demiplanes can be deadly, but they can also provide an unexpected opportunity for exploration and the discovery of wondrous new worlds just below the surface.": "冒险家们不必超越Eberron就能找到奇怪的魔幻境界。在艾伯伦的地表下有一层石头和土壤，那些深入地下的人可能会发现天然洞穴、达卡尼妖精的地下遗迹，或者索尔乌达的矮人境界。但开伯尔的东西不只是岩石和泥土。黑暗中包含了无数的半位面--在这些空间中，管理物质世界的规则并不适用。这些是开伯尔最不自然的方面的来源，它的恶魔在这里形成，daelkyr仍然被囚禁在他们自己的层中（类似于Eberron的其他位面的层）。半位面可以是致命的，但它们也可以为探索和发现地表下奇妙的新世界提供意外的机会。",
	"The Realm Below section of chapter 4 provides ideas of what it can be like to explore the upper regions of Khyber; this section gives an overview of the demiplanes adventurers might encounter as they delve deeper.": "第四章的 \"下面的世界 \"部分提供了探索开伯尔上层地区的想法；这部分概述了冒险者在深入探索时可能遇到的半位面。",
	"The demiplanes of Khyber are somewhat like the layers of other planes. Each demiplane has limited space, though it could be as small as a house or as large as a nation. Its borders might be defined by impassible physical barriers or walls of force, or the pocket of space could wrap around—if you walk far enough in one direction, you'll find you've looped back to where you began.": "开伯尔的半平面有点像其他平面的层次。每个半位面都有有限的空间，尽管它可以像房子一样小，也可以像一个国家一样大。它的边界可能由不可逾越的物理屏障或武力墙来界定，或者空间袋可以环绕--如果你在一个方向上走得足够远，你会发现你已经绕回了你开始的地方。",
	"Reaching a demiplane requires a portal. In some cases, travel also requires rituals or planar conjunctions, and some portals may be impassable, sealed by the ancient wards of dragons or Gatekeeper druids. However, many portals are not only active, but nearly imperceptible; adventurers walking down a tunnel may pass through a portal to the Ironlands without ever knowing it. Portals are static, remaining in one place, and as long as one remains open, adventurers can always retrace their steps to return to it.": "到达一个半位面需要一个传送门。在某些情况下，旅行还需要仪式或平面结合，有些传送门可能无法通过，被龙或守门德鲁伊的古老守卫所封印。然而，许多传送门不仅是活跃的，而且几乎无法察觉；走在隧道里的冒险者可能会在不知不觉中通过一个通往铁地的传送门。传送门是静态的，保持在一个地方，只要有一个传送门保持开放，冒险者总是可以追溯他们的脚步，回到它。",
	"Demiplanes may have two or more portals, each leading to anywhere on the Material Plane. The realm of Dyrrn the Corruptor has portals beneath the Shadow Marches and the Ironroot Mountains, while both the Kech Shaarat goblinoids of Darguun and the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes make use of portals tied to the Ironlands. As such, demiplanes can allow rapid travel across long distances; adventurers could enter a demiplane below Q'barra, walk what seems like only a mile, then emerge from a tunnel into Breland. Demiplanes have much in common with Eberron's thirteen planes. Natural laws may not apply within, and time, space, or other elements may behave in unnatural ways. A demiplane could have some of the properties of another plane, like the Burning Bright property of Fernia or the Primordial Matter property of Lamannia. But there's no universal theme that unites all demiplanes; each one is entirely unique. Some sages say that these demiplanes are Khyber's dreams. Others believe that demiplanes are unfinished ideas—early drafts of reality or seeds that never quite became planes.": "半位面可能有两个或更多的传送门，每个传送门都通向物质界的任何地方。腐蚀者迪尔恩的王国在阴影地带和铁根山下有传送门，而达尔古恩的凯奇-沙拉特妖精和恶魔荒原的加什卡拉兽人都使用了与铁地相连的传送门。因此，半平面可以实现长距离的快速旅行；冒险者可以进入卡巴拉（Q'barra）下面的半平面，走了似乎只有一英里，然后从隧道里出来，进入布雷兰德。半位面与Eberron的13个位面有很多共同之处。自然法则可能不适用于其中，时间、空间或其他元素可能以非自然的方式行事。一个半位面可以拥有另一个位面的一些属性，比如费尔尼亚的燃烧之光属性或拉曼尼亚的原始物质属性。但没有一个普遍的主题将所有半位面统一起来；每个半位面都是完全独特的。一些圣人说，这些半平面是开伯尔的梦想。其他人认为，半平面是未完成的想法--现实的早期草案或从未完全成为平面的种子。",
	"While demiplanes are usually limited in size, there's no inherent logic to their construction. It's possible to be a mile below the surface of Eberron when you discover a valley that appears to be open to the sky... but it's not the sky of Eberron! Unlike the planes, the demiplanes of Khyber don't contain any of Eberron's celestial objects—there could be moons, rings, even suns in the sky, but they'll be entirely unfamiliar.": "虽然半飞机的尺寸通常是有限的，但它们的构造并没有固有的逻辑。你有可能在艾伯伦地表下一英里处发现一个看似通向天空的山谷......但那并不是艾伯伦的天空 与平面不同，开伯尔的半平面不包含任何Eberron的天体--天空中可能有卫星、星环，甚至太阳，但它们将是完全陌生的。",
	"While there's no common theme that unites all demiplanes, there are three common categories of demiplane: hearts, prisons, and shadows.": "虽然没有共同的主题将所有的半位面统一起来，但有三个共同的半位面类别：心脏、监狱和阴影。",
	"The overlords—{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}, {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, and others—are said to be Khyber's first children. They were the first fiends to physically manifest, and each overlord brought forth a host of lesser fiends. When a fiend dies, its essence returns to Khyber. Each one is bound to and reincarnated in a particular demiplane within Khyber—the heart of an overlord. This is one reason the overlords can't be permanently destroyed; each is part of the architecture of Khyber itself, and the overlord's form that can be encountered in Eberron is simply a projection of its essence. To defeat the overlords, the champions of the Age of Demons used the Silver Flame to bind their immortal essence, preventing them from returning to their heart demiplane to reform. This essentially severed the brain from the heart—but the heart demiplanes still exist. The lesser servants of the overlord—its rakshasa and other fiend minions—return to the heart when they reform, and should an overlord's bonds be broken, it will recover its full strength in its heart realm.": "霸主--{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}、{@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}和其他--据说是开伯尔的第一个孩子。他们是第一个显现出来的恶魔，每个霸主都带来了一大批较小的恶魔。当一个恶魔死亡时，它的精华会回到开伯尔。每个人都被束缚在开伯尔的一个特定的半位面中转世--一个霸主的心脏。这也是霸主无法被永久消灭的原因之一；每一个霸主都是凯博尔本身架构的一部分，而在埃伯龙遇到的霸主的形态只是其本质的投影。为了打败霸主，恶魔时代的冠军们用银色火焰束缚住他们不朽的本质，防止他们回到自己的心魔世界进行改造。这实质上切断了大脑与心脏的联系，但心脏半位面仍然存在。霸主较小的仆人--它的罗刹和其他恶魔爪牙--在改造时返回心脏，如果霸主的束缚被打破，它将在其心界恢复全部力量。",
	"Heart demiplanes are relatively small, around the size of a large city. Each reflects the overlord it's tied to in appearance and properties. Just as the shard-prison of an overlord's spirit can affect a region, portals to a heart realm often affect the surrounding area; what's believed to be a manifest zone to Shavarath might instead be a portal to the Bitter Shield. While the overlords aren't consciously present in their hearts, their essences still permeate them. Heart realms are typically inhabited by a host of lesser fiends bound to that overlord. Many have no desire to return to Eberron until their overlords are free, while others serve in the Lords of Dust, using the heart as a refuge. A couple hearts are described below, but there are at least thirty—one for each overlord.": "心魔飞机相对较小，大约相当于一个大城市的大小。每个心界在外观和属性上都反映了它所联系的霸主。就像一个霸主的灵魂的碎片监狱可以影响一个地区一样，通往心界的门户往往会影响到周围的地区；被认为是通往沙瓦拉斯的显化区可能是通往苦难之盾的门户。虽然霸主们并没有有意识地出现在他们的心中，但他们的本质仍然渗透在其中。心灵领域通常居住着许多与该霸主有联系的低等魔物。许多人在他们的霸主获得自由之前，并不愿意回到Eberron，而其他人则在尘埃领主中服务，把心界作为一个避难所。下面介绍了几个心脏，但每个霸主至少有三十一个。",
	"Rak Tulkhesh's heart is a crimson fortress, with stones soaked in blood and walls studded with rusted iron spikes. Around the tower's base, rakshasas and other fiends endlessly battle, their pointless struggle reflecting the bloodlust of their master. Mordakhesh the Shadowsword often returns to the Bitter Shield between schemes, and is hailed as lord of the fortress.": "拉克-图尔克什的心脏是一座深红色的堡垒，石头被血浸透，墙上钉满了生锈的铁钉。在塔基周围，罗刹和其他魔鬼无休止地战斗，他们毫无意义的挣扎反映了他们主人的嗜血。影剑莫达克什（Mordakhesh the Shadowsword）经常在计划之间回到苦盾，并被誉为堡垒的领主。",
	"The Bitter Shield has the Unquenchable Fury and Bloodletting properties of Shavarath.": "苦难之盾具有沙瓦拉特的不灭之怒和放血属性。",
	"The heart of Sul Khatesh is a tower built from black stone traced with silver. It glitters in the light of three unfamiliar crescent moons. Here, it's always night, and the servants of the Keeper of Secrets sing paeans to the moons as they perform bloody sacrifices and trace eldritch symbols in the soil. The tower holds a library of dark secrets, and beside it, a scriptorium where fiends scribe the books of shadows that may be given to mortal warlocks. Beneath the city of Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes lies a portal to the Tower of Shadows, and the rakshasa Hektula dwells here when she's not tending to the library of Ashtakala.": "Sul Khatesh的中心是一座由黑色石头建成的塔，上面有银色的痕迹。它在三个陌生的新月的光芒下闪闪发光。在这里，永远是夜晚，秘密守护者的仆人们一边对着月亮唱颂歌，一边进行血腥的祭祀，并在土壤中描画出古老的符号。塔楼里有一个关于黑暗秘密的图书馆，旁边还有一个文字室，恶魔们在那里写下了可能会交给凡人术士的阴影之书。在恶魔荒原的阿什塔卡拉城下有一个通往阴影之塔的入口，当罗刹-赫克图拉不在照料阿什塔卡拉的图书馆时，她就住在这里。",

	"When something is described as being \"trapped in Khyber,\" it usually means it's trapped in a demiplane somewhere in Khyber. The most infamous prisoners of Khyber are the daelkyr, but there may well be others—either immortal spirits or mortal creatures that were trapped in the demiplane by their enemies.": "当某些东西被描述为 \"被困在开伯尔 \"时，通常意味着它被困在开伯尔的某个半位面。最臭名昭著的开伯尔囚犯是戴尔基尔（daelkyr），但也可能有其他人--要么是不朽的灵魂，要么是被敌人困在半位面的凡人生物。",
	"Dyrrn the Corruptor dwells in the Palace of Sinew, and Belashyrra in the Citadel of Lidless Eyes (both are described in {@book Eberron: Rising From The Last War|ERLW}). Valaara is bound in the Deepest Hive, described in chapter 8 of this book. It's said that the daelkyr Orlassk dwells in a fortress carved into a giant gargoyle that roams the tunnels of Khyber; it could be that the gargoyle exists in Orlassk's prison realm, or perhaps the massive creature contains a portal to its prison.": "腐蚀者Dyrrn住在筋肉宫殿，Belashyrra住在无眼城堡（两者都在{@book Eberron: Rising From The Last War|ERLW}中描述）。瓦拉拉被束缚在最深的蜂巢中，本书第八章有描述。据说daelkyr Orlassk住在一个雕刻成巨大石像的堡垒里，石像在开伯尔的隧道里游荡；可能是石像存在于Orlassk的监狱领域，也可能是这个巨大的生物包含一个通往其监狱的入口。",
	"When dealing with a prison demiplane, the DM will have to decide the limitations of the portals. In the case of the daelkyr demiplanes, the daelkyr can't leave them, but other creatures can freely enter or depart. So Dyrrn's minions can swarm out of the Palace of Sinew, but as long as the Gatekeepers' seals remain intact, Dyrrn itself cannot leave. The nature of the binding and the power of the daelkyr is such that they have shaped their demiplanes in their image, but lesser creatures could be trapped in more traditional prisons.": "在处理监狱半位面时，DM将不得不决定传送门的限制。就daelkyr半位面而言，daelkyr不能离开它们，但其他生物可以自由进入或离开。因此，Dyrrn的爪牙可以蜂拥而出，但只要守门人的封印保持完整，Dyrrn本身就不能离开。捆绑的性质和达尔凯尔的力量使他们以自己的形象塑造了他们的半平面，但较小的生物可以被困在更传统的监狱里。",
	"Unlike heart and prison demiplanes, shadow demiplanes serve no clear purpose. They aren't prisons or fortresses of evil, but rather, strange reflections of the world. Much like Xoriat, they often defy natural logic—and this often gives them great value. Beneath the Ironroot Mountains in the Realm Below, the dwarves found a realm where precious stones grow on trees. In the Vale of the Inner Sun, creatures don't age.": "与心脏和监狱的半平面不同，阴影半平面没有明确的目的。它们不是监狱或邪恶的堡垒，而是世界的奇怪反映。就像Xoriat一样，它们经常违背自然逻辑--而这往往赋予它们巨大的价值。在下界的铁根山下，矮人发现了一个宝石长在树上的境界。在 \"内太阳谷\"，生物不会衰老。",
	"Many sages call these \"shadow demiplanes\" because many seem to be shadows of other planes; the Abyssal Forest of Khaar is a reflection of Lamannia, while the Ironlands bears some resemblance to Shavarath. But in fact, demiplanes of Khyber have no ties to the other planes, nor are they touched by the natural influence of Eberron or the celestial light of Siberys. Perhaps the concepts woven into these demiplanes are echoes of Khyber's dreams or hints of what might have been... or perhaps their resemblance is inexplicable coincidence.": "许多贤者称这些为 \"影子半位面\"，因为许多似乎是其他位面的影子；卡亚尔的深渊森林是拉曼尼亚的反映，而铁地与沙瓦拉斯有一些相似之处。但事实上，开伯尔的半位面与其他位面没有任何联系，它们也没有受到艾伯伦的自然影响或西伯利亚的天体之光的触动。也许编织在这些半位面中的概念是开伯尔梦境的回声，或者是对可能发生的事情的暗示......或者它们的相似性是莫名其妙的巧合。",
	"Shadow realms may hold important resources that can be used or harvested—but these regions always have a malevolent aspect. Fiends are common, and even mortal creatures that dwell there are sinister. Remaining in a shadow realm for too long is usually an invitation to corruption. There are countless shadow demiplanes, some small and others vast; those mentioned here are just a few examples.": "影子领域可能拥有可以使用或收获的重要资源--但这些地区总是有一个邪恶的方面。恶魔很常见，甚至居住在那里的凡人生物也很邪恶。在影子领域停留过久通常是对腐败的一种邀请。有无数的影子世界，有些很小，有些很大；这里提到的只是几个例子。",
	"At first glance, this seems a primeval forest, but on closer inspection, it's filled with horrors. The demiplane is tangled in crimson vines filled with blood. It teems with monstrosities, twisted beasts that aren't as alien as the aberrations of the daelkyr, but just as deadly; even its most charming songbirds are carnivorous and cruel. The forest's strange vegetation can be used to make potions or deadly poisons, valuable resources—for those willing to brave its horrors. While in the Abyssal Forest of Khaar, any creature that's not naturally immune to poison damage becomes vulnerable to poison damage, and it has disadvantage on saving throws against poison.": "乍一看，这似乎是一片原始森林，但仔细一看，它充满了恐怖。半位面被充满鲜血的深红色藤蔓缠住了。这里充斥着怪兽、扭曲的野兽，它们并不像达尔凯尔的畸形动物那样异类，但同样致命；即使是它最迷人的鸣禽也是食肉的、残忍的。森林中奇怪的植被可以用来制作药水或致命的毒药，对于那些愿意勇敢面对森林恐怖的人来说，这是宝贵的资源。在卡亚尔的深渊森林中，任何对毒药伤害没有天然免疫的生物都会受到毒药伤害，并且在对毒药的救赎上有劣势。",
	"This realm's entire landscape is formed from metal. Adamantine trees grow razor-sharp leaves, and iron blades of grass cut through soft shoes. This demiplane, which has Shavarath's Bloodletting property, is home to bands of devils and demons that engage in their own endless wars. These fiends enjoy fighting and oppressing mortals, but fortunately, they can't leave their realm. The Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes raid the Ironlands, pillaging weapons from the warrior fiends. The Kech Shaarat (see chapter 4) have expanded their deep vault into the Ironlands; over many centuries, these dar have established an alliance with one of the devil clans, allowing them to hold onto this territory. It's up to the DM to decide on the foundation of this alliance and whether the Shaarat can leverage it in other ways.": "这个王国的整个景观是由金属形成的。金刚树长出锋利的树叶，铁制的草叶划破柔软的鞋子。这个拥有沙瓦拉特的放血属性的半位面，是一群魔鬼和恶魔的家园，他们从事着自己的无尽战争。这些恶魔喜欢战斗和压迫凡人，但幸运的是，他们不能离开自己的领域。恶魔荒原的加什卡拉（Ghaash'kala）兽人袭击了铁地，从战士魔人那里掠夺武器。Kech Shaarat人（见第4章）将他们的深渊金库扩展到了铁地；经过许多个世纪，这些达尔人与某个恶魔家族建立了联盟，使他们能够守住这片领土。至于这个联盟的基础，以及沙拉特人是否能以其他方式利用这个联盟，则由DM来决定。",
	"A widespread cult of the Dragon Below believes that there is a paradise within Khyber, a place free from suffering and death. The Vale of the Inner Sun does exist, and it has the Stillness of Flesh property of Risia and the Light of Life property of Irian. However, there is a price to this immortality; creatures who dwell in the Vale for an extended time become slowly mutated, eventually turning into unique aberrations. The inhabitants of the Vale—some of whom have been there for centuries—have no love of outsiders, and visitors must prove their worth to bathe in the prismatic light of the Inner Sun.": "一个广泛存在的 \"下面的龙 \"的崇拜者相信，在开伯尔内有一个天堂，一个没有痛苦和死亡的地方。内太阳谷确实存在，它拥有里西亚的肉体静止属性和伊里安的生命之光属性。然而，这种不朽是有代价的；长期居住在谷地的生物会慢慢变异，最终变成独特的畸形。谷地的居民--有些人已经在那里生活了几个世纪--对外来者没有好感，游客必须证明自己的价值才能沐浴在内太阳的棱镜光中。",

Orien has discovered one such passage; its enclaves in the cities of Passage (in Aundair) and Varna (in the Eldeen Reaches) are built above portals that connect to a tiny, safe shadow demiplane. This allows Orien to move between these two cities within minutes. However, the two cities are already close and well connected, so this has remained a secret resource instead of being put to widespread commercial use.": "影子飞机可以作为通往远方的虫洞--一种运输人员和货物的宝贵手段！Orien发现了一个这样的通道；它在通道（Aundair的城市）和瓦尔纳（Eldeen Reaches的城市）的飞地上建造了传送门，连接到小小的安全的影子飞机。Orien已经发现了一个这样的通道；它在通道（Aundair）和瓦尔纳（Eldeen Reaches）这两个城市的飞地都建在连接到一个微小、安全的影子半位面的门户之上。这使得Orien可以在几分钟之内在这两个城市之间移动。然而，这两座城市已经很接近了，而且联系紧密，所以这一直是一种秘密资源，而不是被广泛地用于商业用途。",

He dreams of finding a route providing safe, swift passage across the Mournland, which could become an Orien commercial route or even carry a lightning rail.

On the other hand, it can crush individuality and innovation. It shows that laws can serve justice, but they can also pose an endless series of obstacles, or even be the tools of tyrants. Daanvi encompasses all of these paths.

	"The angels and devils of Daanvi use normal statistics, but their appearance is similar to modrons and inevitables. They might have metallic skin or wings, or even look like living constructs. These immortals are creatures of absolute law and can't be compelled to break it or act against their nature. All celestials and fiends of Daanvi possess the following Axiomatic Mind trait:": "达安维的天使和魔鬼使用正常的统计数据，但他们的外观与莫德隆和不可避免的人相似。他们可能有金属皮肤或翅膀，甚至看起来像活的构造物。这些不朽者是绝对法则的生物，不能被强迫违反法则或违背本性行事。所有达安维的天人和魔人都拥有以下公理心的特征。",
	"The creature can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or instructions.": "不能强迫生物以违背其本性或指令的方式行事。",
	"Daanvi doesn't have a significant population of mortals, though there are other immortals in Daanvi beyond those explored by this section, each one representing a facet of the plane; for example, ant-like formians inhabit numerous layers of their own.": "达安维没有大量的凡人人口，尽管除了本节所探讨的那些之外，达安维还有其他的不朽者，每个人都代表了这个平面的一个方面；例如，像蚂蚁一样的formians居住在他们自己的无数层中。",
	"{@creature mordrone||Modrons}, Daanvi's most common inhabitants, are embodiments of pure law, with no bias toward justice or oppression. They do their assigned tasks and obey every law; nothing more, nothing less. Monodrones can be found in many layers performing the most basic tasks. More sophisticated modrons perform endless administrative tasks and enforce basic laws.": "{@creature mordrone||Modrons}，Daanvi最常见的居民，是纯粹的法律的化身，不偏向于正义或压迫。他们做他们被分配的任务，并遵守每一条法律；仅此而已，别无其他。在许多层中都可以找到单体，执行最基本的任务。更复杂的莫德隆人执行无尽的行政任务和执行基本法律。",
	"{@creature marut|MTF|Inevitables} are powerful constructs dedicated to enforcing the law in all its aspects. Mighty maruts can be assigned to enforce specific contracts; note that these maruts have nothing to do with their counterparts in Dolurrh, just as the devils of Daanvi aren't related to those in Shavarath. The Justify trait of Daanvian maruts transports victims to the Hall of Justice in Daanvi.": "{@creature marut|MTF|Inevitables}是致力于执行法律的各个方面的强大建筑。强大的马鲁特可以被指派去执行特定的合同；注意这些马鲁特与他们在多鲁尔的同行没有任何关系，就像达安维的魔鬼与沙瓦拉斯的魔鬼没有关系一样。达安维的马鲁特的 \"正义 \"特性可以将受害者传送到达安维的正义大厅。",
	"In addition to the modrons and inevitables presented in the {@book Monster Manual|mm} and {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}, all of which are found in Daanvi, there are others that serve specific tasks within the plane. In particular, an entity known as the Kolyarut resides beneath the Hall of Justice, with absolute authority over enforcing the law. The Kolyarut acts through a legion of host bodies, one of which serves on every inevitable tribunal; these beings are also called Kolyarut, though they're only representatives of the greater force.": "除了{@book Monster Manual|mm}和{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}中介绍的莫德隆和不可避免的人，所有这些人都在达安维被发现，还有一些人在这个星球上执行特殊任务。特别是，一个被称为 \"Kolyarut \"的实体居住在正义殿堂的下面，拥有执行法律的绝对权力。Kolyarut通过一个主机军团行事，其中一个在每个不可避免的法庭上服务；这些生命也被称为Kolyarut，尽管他们只是更大力量的代表。",
	"The angels of Daanvi represent law in the service of justice and the greater good. These immortals enforce the laws, but also do their best to act fairly and to see that justice is done. While angels have duties to attend to and rarely have time to simply chat with random mortals, they're typically kind and helpful when they do have time. They believe with all their being that law and civilization are the most vital virtues of all, and that the law can't be set aside for any reason.": "达安维的天使代表法律，为正义和更大的利益服务。这些神仙执行法律，但也尽最大努力公平行事，确保正义得到伸张。虽然天使有职责在身，很少有时间与随机的凡人聊天，但当他们有时间时，他们通常是善良和乐于助人。他们全身心地相信法律和文明是最重要的美德，法律不能因为任何原因而被搁置。",
	"{@creature deva||Devas} and other angels of similar power are local authorities. They can be found as ministers, magistrates, and sages. A deva may be appointed to serve as a counselor for mortals called before an inevitable tribunal. The devas at the Infinite Archive serve as sages; modrons file and record, but the devas study the data and reflect on it. Meanwhile, powerful planetars serve as high ministers and guardians of important gates and sites.": "{@creature deva||Devas}和其他具有类似能力的天使是地方当局。他们可以作为部长、行政长官和圣人出现。魔鬼可能被任命为凡人的顾问，被召集到一个不可避免的法庭前。无限档案馆的魔鬼作为圣人；摩登人归档和记录，但魔鬼研究数据并反思它。同时，强大的行星人作为高级部长和重要的门和地点的守护者。",
	"Solars dwell in the Panopticon. There are thirteen solars, each assigned to monitor and administer justice within one of Eberron's planes (though no solar holds dominion over the Material Plane). However, there are a host of restrictions on how and when they may act. Typically, a solar must be invoked by a legitimate authority within the plane in question—so while Hazariel, the Solar of Syrania, is usually called in to cast down radiant idols, Azazar, the Solar of Xoriat, has never yet been called on by that plane. Until called, they watch; while in the Panopticon, solars can observe anything that occurs in the plane of their dominion. Shortly before the shift of the Quor Tarai that produced il-Lashtavar, Tyrala, the Solar of Dal Quor, went to investigate the actions that resulted in Dal Quor being thrown off its planar axis; she hasn't been seen since.": "太阳人居住在泛神殿中。一共有13个太阳神，每个太阳神都被指派在Eberron的一个位面中监督和管理司法（尽管没有太阳神拥有对物质位面的统治权）。然而，他们的行动方式和时间都有一系列的限制。通常情况下，太阳神必须被相关位面的合法权威所召唤--所以西拉尼亚的太阳神哈扎里尔通常会被召唤来打倒光芒四射的偶像，而Xoriat的太阳神阿扎扎尔则从未被该位面召唤过。在被召唤之前，他们一直在观察；而在全景图中，太阳神可以观察到在他们统治的平面内发生的任何事情。在产生il-Lashtavar的Quor Tarai转变前不久，Dal Quor的太阳神Tyrala去调查导致Dal Quor被抛离其平面轴的行动；此后她就再也没有出现过。",
	"The devils of Daanvi represent law in the service of tyranny and personal gain. In essence, they depict the danger of laws and how order can become an oppressive force. While the angels and devils of Daanvi despise one another, the strict laws determining jurisdiction mean that they rarely come into contact and almost never engage in combat—though it's common for a devil and an angel to be found in opposite positions arguing a case before an inevitable tribunal in the Hall of Justice.": "达安维的魔鬼代表法律为暴政和个人利益服务。从本质上讲，他们描述了法律的危险性以及秩序如何成为一种压迫性的力量。虽然达安维的天使和魔鬼互相鄙视，但决定管辖权的严格法律意味着他们很少接触，也几乎从不交战--尽管在正义殿堂里，一个魔鬼和一个天使在不可避免的法庭前争论一个案子是很常见的。",
	"Most often, devils are found in layers such as the Iron Ward, where they're cruel enforcers and tyrants. They can be encountered as guardians and sentinels, though they're invariably too harsh when it comes to performing their duties. Other devils seek to exploit loopholes and use the law to their advantage, extorting adventurers or otherwise using the law as a weapon. Orthons and erinyes apprehend lawbreakers, while pit fiends serve as executioners in the Hall of Justice.": "最常见的是，魔鬼被发现在铁区等层，他们是残酷的执行者和暴君。他们可以作为守护者和哨兵被遇到，尽管他们在履行职责时总是过于严厉。其他魔鬼试图利用漏洞，将法律用于他们的利益，敲诈冒险者或以其他方式将法律作为武器。奥瑟斯（Orthons）和埃林耶斯（Erinyes）负责抓捕违法者，而坑道魔王则在正义之厅担任刽子手。",
	"Every tyrant needs people to oppress, while every utopian society needs people to enjoy its just laws. The countless manifestations of Daanvi, called subjects, serve this purpose. They're humanoid, but their shape is indistinct. They provide the {@i impression} of a person—someone completely normal and unremarkable, often of the same species as the viewer—but no matter how hard anyone tries, it's impossible to actually focus on them. Conversations with subjects are surface-level at best, with no distinct personality or goals. Subjects pose no threat in combat, and are dispersed if they suffer any damage, only to reform within a few minutes.": "每个暴君都需要人去压迫，而每个乌托邦社会都需要人去享受其公正的法律。达安维的无数表现形式，即所谓的臣民，就是为了这个目的。他们是人形，但他们的形状是不明确的。他们提供了一个人的{@i impression}--一个完全正常的、不引人注目的人，通常与观众是同一物种，但无论任何人如何努力，都不可能真正关注到他们。与受试者的对话充其量是表面的，没有明显的个性或目标。实验对象在战斗中不构成威胁，如果他们受到任何伤害，就会被驱散，只是在几分钟内就会恢复。",
	"Daanvi is home to hundreds of layers, and each is a metaphor for a particular aspect of order or civilization. Time is consistent across all layers, though in some, denizens work at all hours, while in others, there are strict regulations about what times certain activities are allowed. Daanvi has its own calendar, but denizens can easily translate it to the standard calendar of Galifar (or any other system) when dealing with visiting mortals.": "Daanvi有数百个层次，每个层次都是秩序或文明的一个特定方面的隐喻。所有层的时间都是一致的，尽管在一些层，居民在任何时间都可以工作，而在另一些层，对某些活动的时间有严格的规定。达安维有自己的日历，但居民在与来访的凡人打交道时，可以很容易地把它翻译成加利法尔的标准日历（或任何其他系统）。",
	"Traveling to Daanvi using plane shift or similar abilities takes you to the Prime Gate. The portals between layers are clearly labeled and easily found, with angelic guides happy to provide assistance. Lesser portals are guarded by modrons, while major portals may be maintained by a horned devil or planetar. Travel passes can be obtained at the Prime Gate, though violating local ordinances can result in a revoked travel pass.": "使用飞机转移或类似的能力旅行到达安维，会把你带到主门。各层之间的传送门都有明确的标记，很容易找到，天使向导很乐意提供帮助。较小的传送门由莫德隆（modrons）看守，而主要的传送门可能由有角的魔鬼或星球人维护。旅行通行证可以在主门获得，但违反当地法规会导致旅行通行证被吊销。",
	"While some rules—such as the system of gateways and travel passes—are universal, every layer has its own distinct laws. Often these are typical—no theft, no assault except in selfdefense. However, layers may have unusual ordinances—no spellcasting illusion magic after noon. The scope of laws, punishment, and enforcement vary considerably based on the oppressiveness of the layer; is it generally just (administered by angels), even-handed (modrons), or oppressive (devils)? In gentler layers, lawbreakers receive an instructive warning from an angel; those in harsher layers aren't so lucky. In some cases, guardians administer an immediate punishment, as discussed in the \"Daanvian Judgment\" sidebar. More serious offenders may be taken to the Hall of Justice to face an inevitable tribunal.": "虽然有些规则--如门禁系统和旅行通行证--是通用的，但每一层都有自己的独特法律。通常这些都是典型的--不偷不抢，除非自卫，否则不得攻击。然而，各层可能会有不寻常的条例--中午之后不得施展幻觉魔法。法律的范围、惩罚和执行根据该层的压迫性而有很大的不同；它通常是公正的（由天使管理），公平的（莫德隆），还是压迫的（魔鬼）？在较温和的层级，违法者会收到天使的指示性警告；而在较严酷的层级，则没有这么幸运。在某些情况下，监护人会立即进行惩罚，如 \"Daanvian Judgment \"侧边栏中所讨论的。更严重的犯罪者可能会被带到司法大厅，面对不可避免的法庭。",
	"What happens when characters break the laws of Daanvi? In theory, there's an incredibly complex Code of Justice that the Kolyarut uses to determine the ideal punishment. In practice, the punishment should fit the crime, but it depends on the district where the judgment takes place. An angel upholds the law but seeks to ensure that the punishment truly is fair; a devil may use the threat of a disproportionate punishment (entirely legitimate by the Code of Justice, of course) to drive extortion.": "当人物违反达安维的法律时会发生什么？在理论上，有一个非常复杂的《正义法典》，科里亚鲁特用它来决定理想的惩罚。在实践中，惩罚应该与犯罪相适应，但这取决于判决发生的地区。天使维护法律，但寻求确保惩罚真正公平；魔鬼可能利用不相称的惩罚的威胁（当然，根据《正义法典》完全合法）来推动敲诈。",
	"Physical punishments are possible, from beating to maiming (such as the loss of an eye or tongue) to execution. Such punishments are most common in oppressive layers. Imprisonment is rare, but possible, either in a local cell or the Inescapable Prison. Because of the flowing time of Daanvi, a hundred years in a Daanvi cell is only ten years on Eberron.": "身体上的惩罚是可能的，从殴打到致残（如失去眼睛或舌头）到处决。这种惩罚在压迫层中最为常见。监禁是罕见的，但也有可能，要么是在当地的牢房，要么是在不可逃脱的监狱。由于达安维的流动时间，在达安维牢房中的一百年在Eberron上只是十年。",
	"Fines are common, not because Daanvi needs revenue, but because it's easily adjusted to the individual. Fines like gold or property can be taken immediately, or future earnings might be garnished; perhaps half of all gold the character acquires immediately vanishes until the fine has been paid. Another common punishment is the {@i judgment tattoo}, a complex marking placed across the victim's face that can't be removed by any power short of a {@spell wish} spell. Any creature that speaks a language can magically understand its meaning, conveyed in a simple concept like MURDERER or THIEF. A successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check allows a character to identify it as a {@i judgment tattoo} from Daanvi.": "罚款很常见，不是因为达安维需要收入，而是因为它很容易调整到个人。像黄金或财产这样的罚款可以立即被拿走，或者未来的收入可能被扣留；也许角色获得的所有黄金的一半会立即消失，直到罚款被支付。另一种常见的惩罚是{@i judgment tattoo}，一种横在受害者脸上的复杂标记，除了{@spell wish}的法术外，任何力量都无法去除。任何会说一种语言的生物都能神奇地理解它的含义，用简单的概念来表达，如谋杀者或盗贼。一个成功的{@dc 15}智力({@skill Arcana})检查允许一个角色识别它是一个来自达安维的{@i judgment tattoo}。",
	"Other magical punishments could be imposed. The offender could experience the effects of {@spell bestow curse} for a year or a lifetime. A liar could be unable to tell a lie for a year (though they can be evasive in their answers). A convict could be stripped of a particular talent, taking disadvantage on a specific skill check during their the sentence. They could be stripped of fame, and no one will give the victim credit for positive actions, though they can still receive blame for misdeeds. There are few limits on what an inevitable tribunal can do, and undoing such a judgment requires the power of a {@spell wish}.": "可以施加其他神奇的惩罚。犯罪者可以在一年或一生中经历（%0%）的影响。骗子可以在一年内无法说谎话（尽管他们可以在回答问题时拐弯抹角）。一个罪犯可以被剥夺某项天赋，在服刑期间对某项技能的检查中处于劣势。他们可以被剥夺名声，没有人会给受害者的积极行为以荣誉，尽管他们仍然可以为错误行为受到指责。一个不可避免的法庭所能做的事情几乎没有限制，而撤销这样的判决需要有{@spell wish}的力量。",
	"Some of Daanvi's most noteworthy layers are described below; other layers each express some form of order of civilization, though most are of little interest to adventurers. There are examples of utopian governance, mob justice, and countless other examples of law at work. The Perfect Grange is a vast, precisely maintained farm, displaying the virtues of agricultural discipline. Hive 43 is a formian settlement where immortal ant-like spirits care for their queen; if that doesn't strike your fancy, maybe one of the other 42 hives will!": "下面描述了达安维最值得注意的一些层级；其他层级各自表达了某种形式的文明秩序，尽管大多数对冒险者来说兴趣不大。这里有乌托邦式的治理、暴民式的正义，以及无数其他法律发挥作用的例子。完美格兰奇是一个巨大的、精确维护的农场，展示了农业纪律的美德。第43号蜂巢是一个形式主义的定居点，不朽的蚂蚁一样的灵魂在那里照顾他们的女王；如果这还不能打动你，也许其他42个蜂巢中的一个会让你心动!",
	"Imagine Terminus Station in Sharn, but instead of skycoaches and rail tickets, portals lead to different layers. Hundreds of subjects and modrons mill about, standing in orderly queues as they wait to pass through a portal. By Daanvian law, all travelers must pass through the Prime Gate, where plane shift and astral travel deposit adventurers. If people enter Daanvi through some other means, they're in violation of the law—never a good idea.": "想象一下沙恩的终点站，但不是天车和火车票，而是通往不同层级的传送门。成百上千的臣民和莫德隆人在此穿梭，有序地排着队等待通过门户。根据Daanvian的法律，所有的旅行者都必须通过主门，在那里，平面转换和星际旅行的冒险家们都会有机会。如果人们通过其他方式进入达安维，他们就违反了法律--绝不是个好主意。",
	"While the Prime Gate's bustling appearance suggests Daanvi is as welcoming to travelers as Syrania, most traffic consists of local commuters moving between layers. Extraplanar visitors must acquire travel passes from the Passage Authority; how difficult this is depends on the tone of the Authority when you arrive... and this shifts from day to day. If the Authority is just, the angels keep it moving quickly and smoothly; as long as you truly have a valid reason for your travel, you should be able to pass. If the Authority is even-handed, it's managed by modrons; it's possible to get through, but there are immense lines and a lot of redundant paperwork. In addition to having a clearly stated reason for travel, Modrons might only provide access to specific layers, or impose restrictions—\"You'll have to drink that potion now or throw it away.\" And if the Authority is oppressive that day, the devils on duty make it a living hell; the question is whether they're more interested in extortion or tormenting travelers with bureaucratic burdens. Do they want a bribe? Do you need to perform a service for them? This is an archetypal abuse of power; what makes a good story?": "虽然首相门的热闹景象表明，达安维和锡拉尼亚一样欢迎旅行者，但大多数交通是由当地的通勤者在各层之间穿梭。平面外的游客必须从通道管理局获得旅行通行证；这有多难，取决于你到达时管理局的语气......而且这每天都会变化。如果管理局是公正的，天使们会让它快速而顺利地运转；只要你真的有合理的旅行理由，你就应该能够通过。如果管理局是公正的，它由模范人管理；有可能通过，但有巨大的队伍和大量多余的文书工作。除了有明确的旅行理由外，Modrons可能只提供进入特定层的机会，或施加限制--\"你现在必须喝下那瓶药水，否则就扔掉它\"。而如果当局当天是压迫性的，值班的魔鬼就会让它成为一个活生生的地狱；问题是他们是对敲诈更感兴趣，还是用官僚主义的负担来折磨旅行者。他们想要贿赂吗？你需要为他们提供服务吗？这是一个典型的滥用权力；什么是一个好的故事？",
	"In the grand tower of the Panopticon, a host of immortals monitor events occurring across Eberron's planes. Countless modrons observe {@item crysal ball||crystal balls}. There are chambers in which angels and devils stand around wide scrying pools, replaying recent events. And in the highest chamber of the Panopticon, twelve solars—with one seat empty—contemplate the events occurring in the planes they are bound to and wait to be summoned by the authorities of those planes.": "在全景塔中，一众不朽者监视着发生在Eberron星球上的事件。无数的莫德隆人在观察（%0%）。在一些房间里，天使和魔鬼站在宽大的窥视池周围，回放着最近发生的事件。而在泛神殿的最高房间里，十二个索拉人--其中一个座位是空的--在思考他们所绑定的位面所发生的事件，并等待这些位面的当局的召唤。",
	"The Panopticon is larger than the entire city of Sharn. Different sections are devoted to each of the planes, and some immortals have spent countless years monitoring a particular location or creature. It holds the most powerful and sophisticated scrying network in existence, dwarfing the capabilities of even the dragons of Argonnessen. However, this system is not intended to benefit mortals. Adventurers must have an exceptional reason to secure a travel pass allowing admittance to the Panopticon, and the immortals who work there are not inclined to answer questions.": "泛神殿比整个沙恩城都要大。每个星球都有不同的部分，有些不朽者花了无数年时间来监视某个特定的地点或生物。它拥有现存的最强大、最复杂的窥探网络，甚至让阿贡尼森的龙的能力都相形见绌。然而，这个系统并不打算让凡人受益。冒险者必须有一个特殊的理由才能获得允许进入泛神殿的旅行通行证，而在那里工作的不朽者也不愿意回答问题。",
	"The Hall of Justice is an immense complex containing an impossible number of courts and chambers of inquiry. In smaller chambers, immortals debate the actions of the beings observed in the Panopticon. There are angels discussing the Treaty of Thronehold, while inevitables dissect the latest actions in the endless wars of Shavarath. These debates are pro forma; while a judgment is made and recorded in the Infinite Archive, no action is ever taken. The weightier matters are resolved before an inevitable tribunal, led by a Kolyarut, an inevitable representative of the great arbiter of impartial justice whose spirit permeates the hall itself. The tribunal is typically filled out with a planetar and an amnizu, each working to sway the Kolyarut's deciding vote to their side.": "司法厅是一个巨大的建筑群，包含了不可能数量的法庭和调查室。在较小的房间里，不朽者们在讨论在全景图中观察到的生命的行为。有天使在讨论《王权条约》，而不可避免的人则在剖析沙瓦拉斯无尽战争中的最新行动。这些辩论是形式上的；虽然做出了判断并记录在无限档案中，但从未采取任何行动。更重要的事情是在一个不可避免的法庭上解决，由Kolyarut领导，他是公正的伟大仲裁者的不可避免的代表，其精神渗透到大厅本身。法庭通常由一名行星人和一名无名氏组成，每个人都在努力将Kolyarut的决定性一票摇到自己这一边。",
	"Adventurers who violate the laws of Daanvi are brought before an immortal tribunal. Usually this is a straightforward matter; the judges question the accused. The accused is granted an Advocate and opposed by a Voice of Justice; typically one of these is an angel, the other a devil. Both of these immortals may conjure images from the lives of the accused, drawing on the records gathered from the Panopticon. Such a case could be resolved quickly, but depending on protocols invoked or evidence sought (\"Your honors, I'd like to show you three years of the defendant's childhood\"), a case can take quite a long time. Luckily for the accused, the Flowing Time property of Daanvi ensures that when—or if—they return to the Material Plane, time has passed for their friends and foes much more slowly.": "违反达安维法律的冒险者会被带到一个不朽的法庭上。通常这是一个简单的问题；法官对被告进行询问。被告被授予一名辩护人，并由一名正义之声反对；通常其中一个是天使，另一个是魔鬼。这两位神仙都可能从被告的生活中调出图像，利用从泛神殿收集的记录。这样的案件可以很快解决，但根据援引的协议或寻求的证据（\"阁下，我想让你看看被告三年的童年\"），一个案件可能需要相当长的时间。对被告来说，幸运的是，达安维的时间流动属性确保了当或如果他们回到物质界时，他们的朋友和敌人的时间都过得更慢。",
	"Once a case is resolved, the inevitable tribunal enacts their judgment; this ruling is final, and can't be questioned or appealed. The \"Daanvian Judgment\" sidebar presents ideas for penalties that might be imposed on a wrongdoer.": "一旦案件得到解决，不可避免的法庭就会颁布他们的判决；这一裁决是最终的，不能被质疑或上诉。\"Daanvian Judgment \"侧边栏介绍了可能对不法行为人实施的惩罚的想法。",
	"Dolurrh's Library merely contains records of every mortal soul that's passed through it. By contrast, Daanvi's Infinite Archive contains records on every being that's ever existed. Here, the data gathered by the Panopticon and the rulings of the Hall of Justice are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on each individual's deeds, whether they've adhered to or violated countless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn't generally {@i do} anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction to act on it. So through your life, the immortals of Daanvi have watched and judged your every action. You aren't rewarded or punished for your deeds, but they know what you've done, and it's forever preserved on your permanent record.": "多勒赫的图书馆只包含了每个经过它的凡人灵魂的记录。相比之下，达安维的无限档案馆包含了每个曾经存在过的生命的记录。在这里，全景图收集的数据和正义殿堂的裁决被记录并有效地保存下来。记录的重点是每个人的行为，他们是否遵守或违反了无数的法律和道德标准的准则。达安维一般不会（%0%）用这些数据做任何事情；他们没有管辖权，无法对其采取行动。因此，在你的一生中，Daanvi的不朽者们一直在观察和评判你的每一个行动。你不会因为你的行为而受到奖励或惩罚，但他们知道你做了什么，并且永远保存在你的永久记录中。",
	"Mortals must present an excellent reason—or bribe a devil—to get access to the Archive, but it's not as restricted as the Panopticon. The Infinite Archive lives up to its name, and is unknowably vast. If adventurers have a legitimate inquiry, a deva sage can be quite helpful. Working with modrons is a long and tedious process, while devils make it even more unpleasant.": "凡人必须提出一个很好的理由--或者贿赂一个魔鬼--才能进入档案馆，但它并不像禁闭室那样受到限制。无限档案馆名副其实，它的规模大得无法估量。如果冒险者有合理的询问，魔族圣人可以提供很大的帮助。与莫德隆合作是一个漫长而乏味的过程，而魔鬼则使之更加不愉快。",
	"The Iron Ward, a city of gray stone, embodies the worst aspects of oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel amnizu, wields absolute power and can't be questioned or challenged. Most of the subjects of the ward are indentured servants, trapped in inescapable contracts; visitors must be careful not to accept any offers of work in the ward, lest they be similarly trapped. There are regular displays of brutal \"justice\" in the grand plaza. Imps scurry in the shadows, watching outsiders and carrying news of their actions to the chain devils and erinyes that serve as the brutal police force. While they can't punish adventurers \"unjustly,\" they {@i can} tempt visitors into misconduct; fiendish merchants and patrons have many appealing offers for adventurers, but almost all would surely lead to breaking a law of the ward, obscure and ridiculous as it may be.": "铁器区，一个灰色石头的城市，体现了压迫性法律的最糟糕的一面。阿拉斯塔议员，一个残酷的阿姆尼祖，掌握着绝对的权力，不能被质疑或挑战。病房里的大多数人都是契约仆人，被困在无法逃脱的合同中；访客必须小心，不要接受任何在病房里工作的提议，以免他们也被困住。在大广场上经常有残酷的 \"正义 \"展示。小恶魔们在阴影中游荡，监视着外来者，并将他们的行动消息传递给作为残酷的警察部队的链魔和埃林耶。虽然他们不能 \"不公正地 \"惩罚冒险者，但他们（%0%）会引诱游客做出不当行为；恶魔般的商人和顾客对冒险者有许多吸引人的提议，但几乎所有的提议都肯定会导致违反区里的法律，尽管它可能是晦涩和可笑的。",
	"While the Iron Ward symbolizes the evils of oppressive order, it is driven by order. The police and councilors twist the law and weaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws—the one advantage adventurers have in passing through this place. And while the subjects of the Iron Ward are brutally oppressed, they're largely symbolic; it's questionable if the subjects even exist when no one's around to observe their suffering.": "虽然铁狱象征着压迫性秩序的邪恶，但它是由秩序驱动的。警察和议员们扭曲法律并将其武器化，但最终即使他们也必须遵守法律--这是冒险者通过这个地方的一个优势。虽然铁牢的臣民受到了残酷的压迫，但他们在很大程度上是象征性的；当周围没有人观察他们的痛苦时，这些臣民是否存在都是值得怀疑的。",
	"Maintained by devils, this oppressive layer is the embodiment of prison—the inevitable consequence of challenging the law. With the full power of Daanvi behind it, the Inescapable Prison makes Dreadhold look like a cell in the local sheriff's office. It's designed to hold celestials, elementals, and other beings with vast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen planes of existence. Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological processes are put in suspension, so they don't need to eat or drink, and they don't age. It's rare for mortals to end up here, but there may be a few legendary historical figures, long thought dead, who have instead been held in the Inescapable Prison!": "在魔鬼的维护下，这个压迫层是监狱的化身--挑战法律的必然后果。在Daanvi的全部力量支持下，无法逃脱的监狱让Dreadhold看起来像当地警长办公室的一个牢房。它被设计用来关押天人、元素和其他拥有巨大力量的生命；这里有来自半打存在的星球的罪犯。凡人也可以被囚禁在这里；他们的生物过程被暂停，所以他们不需要吃喝，也不会衰老。凡人被关在这里的情况很少，但可能有几个传奇性的历史人物，长期以来被认为已经死亡，但却被关在无法逃脱的监狱里！\"。",

	"Manifest zones tied to Daanvi—which are relatively uncommon—often share one or more of the plane's universal properties. Zones with the Plane of Truth property are often used as makeshift courtrooms by local communities, and a number of the largest courthouses in the Five Nations are built in such zones. Intelligence agencies are always searching for zones with the Eyes of the Law property. Other zones simply reflect the unnatural order of the plane—crops innately grow in perfect rows, or residents find they are more naturally inclined to follow orders. Unsubstantiated legends tell of modrons appearing in manifest zones, attempting to \"repair\" any local buildings and redesigning them to match the architecture of the Perfect Order.": "与达安维相联系的显化区--这相对来说并不常见--通常会分享该平面的一个或多个通用属性。具有真理平面属性的区域经常被当地社区用作临时法庭，而五国中一些最大的法院就建在这样的区域中。情报机构一直在寻找具有法律之眼属性的区域。其他区域只是反映了这个星球的非自然秩序--作物天生生长在完美的行列中，或者居民发现他们更自然地倾向于服从命令。未经证实的传说告诉我们，莫德隆出现在显形区，试图 \"修复 \"当地的任何建筑，并重新设计它们以符合完美秩序的建筑。",
	"Daanvi has coterminous and remote periods, but unlike those of other planes, these have no obvious effects. Some sages believe it may impact the performance of certain rituals or the creation of eldritch machines, and others try to link the rise of major civilizations to coterminous periods, but any supporting examples could be entirely coincidental. Daanvi is noteworthy for its exceptionally long cycle. Traditionally, when Daanvi becomes coterminous, it remains so for an entire century; one hundred years after that, it becomes remote for a century.": "Daanvi有同位素和远程时期，但与其他星球的不同，这些没有明显的影响。一些圣人认为它可能会影响某些仪式的举行或长生机的创造，还有人试图将主要文明的兴起与同时期联系起来，但任何支持性的例子都可能是完全偶然的。达安维值得注意的是其特别长的周期。传统上，当Daanvi成为同位素时，它将保持整整一个世纪；一百年后，它将成为偏远的一个世纪。",
	"Daanvi does two things remarkably well: watch people and punish them. Adventurers could come into possession of an exceptional {@item crystal ball} that's been stolen from the Panopticon, or a set of {@item dimensional shackles} lost by an orthon bounty hunter. Another way that people on the Material Plane can interact with Daanvi is through an {@i unbreakable contract}. In the Hall of Justice, any two creatures can negotiate a contract before a Kolyarut. The terms are inscribed on an enchanted sheet of gold (worth 5,000 gp) and bound to a marut, which acts to enforce the contract. On Eberron, a powerful conjurer could use {@spell planar ally} or a similar spell to summon a Kolyarut to set a contract (though they must provide the gold).": "达安维有两件事做得非常好：观察人们和惩罚他们。冒险者可能会拥有一个从泛灵宫偷来的特殊的（%0%），或者一套被一个Orthon赏金猎人丢失的（%1%）。物质世界的人与达安维互动的另一种方式是通过一个（%2%）。在正义殿堂里，任何两个生物都可以在科里亚鲁特面前商谈一份合同。契约条款被刻在一张被施了魔法的金片上（价值5000金币），并被绑在一个Marut上，Marut负责执行契约。在Eberron，一个强大的魔法师可以使用{@spell planar ally}或类似的法术来召唤Kolyarut来订立契约（不过他们必须提供黄金）。",
	"Daanvi rarely intervenes in daily life, and people don't often think of it due to its lack of dramatic coterminous and remote cycles. Except for those who live near manifest zones, it doesn't intrude on people's lives. The main way Daanvi impacts adventures is if the party needs to get something from the plane itself—they might need knowledge contained in the Infinite Archive, or to know something that can only be seen from the Panopticon. However, they'll have to have a solid case to get past the Prime Gate... or be prepared to bribe a devil.": "达安维很少干预日常生活，人们也不常想到它，因为它缺乏戏剧性的同位素和远程循环。除了那些住在显灵区附近的人，它并不侵入人们的生活。达安维影响冒险的主要方式是，如果当事人需要从飞机本身获得一些东西--他们可能需要无限档案中包含的知识，或者要知道一些只能从泛神殿中看到的东西。然而，他们必须有一个可靠的案例才能通过主门......或者准备好贿赂一个魔鬼。",
	"After an ambush gone wrong, the adventurers find themselves in possession of a file stolen from the Infinite Archive—an indestructible journal containing deep and dangerous knowledge about someone very important. A king? The patriarch of a dragonmarked house? This could be ruinous if it falls into the wrong hands, and it's possible that the Archive will send someone—or something—to recover it. Since it can't be destroyed, what will they do with it?": "在一次出错的伏击后，冒险家们发现自己拥有一份从无限档案馆偷来的文件--一本坚不可摧的日记，其中包含关于某个重要人物的深刻而危险的知识。一个国王？一个有龙纹的家族的族长？如果落入坏人之手，这可能是一场灾难，而且档案馆有可能会派人--或者说是派人去找回它。既然它不能被销毁，他们会怎么处理它呢？",
	"After an adventuring mishap on another plane—perhaps in the Immeasurable Market, as Syrania is most likely to invoke Daanvi's justice—the adventurers are collected by a solar and must account for their actions before an inevitable tribunal.": "在另一个星球上发生冒险事故后--也许是在无量市场，因为锡拉尼亚最有可能援引达安维的正义--冒险者们被一个太阳能收集起来，必须在一个不可避免的法庭上对他们的行为做出解释。",
	"A longtime ally of the adventurers always wears a mask. During a battle, the mask is knocked aside, revealing a {@i judgment tattoo} that signifies LIAR. Is there a reasonable explanation for this?": "一个冒险家的长期盟友总是戴着面具。在一场战斗中，面具被打到一边，露出了一个标志着骗子的（%0%）。对此有什么合理的解释吗？",
	"The adventurers are negotiating a contract they don't intend to uphold, but the other party has a surprise; using a scroll of {@spell planar ally}, a Kolyarut inevitable is called to establish an {@i unbreakable contract}. Can the adventurers find a way around this? Will they accept the contract's terms, or face the wrath of the marut and judgment in Daanvi?": "冒险家们正在谈判一个他们不打算坚持的合同，但对方有一个惊喜；使用一个{@spell planar ally}的卷轴，一个Kolyarut的必然被召唤来建立一个{@i unbreakable contract}。冒险家们能找到绕过这个的办法吗？他们是接受合同的条款，还是面对马鲁特的愤怒和达安维的审判？",
	"Dal Quor is both impossibly distant and remarkably close. Tens of thousands of years ago, the giants of Xen'drik shattered the ties between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. Since then, it's been permanently remote, and no naturally occurring manifest zone to Dal Quor has been discovered. Not even {@spell plane shift} or astral travel can allow direct contact with the Region of Dreams. And yet, it's also the closest of the planes—to visit, just close your eyes. Dreaming is a form of spiritual travel, as your mortal consciousness is drawn to Dal Quor.": "达尔-库尔既是不可能的遥远，又是非常接近的。数万年前，Xen'drik的巨人打破了Dal Quor和物质世界之间的联系。从那时起，它就一直处于永久的遥远状态，没有发现任何自然发生的通往达尔奎尔的显化区。甚至连{@spell plane shift}或星际旅行都不能让人直接接触到梦之区。然而，它也是最接近的平面--访问，只要闭上眼睛。做梦是精神旅行的一种形式，因为你的凡人意识被吸引到Dal Quor。",
	"Dal Quor is the realm of dreams, a place of imagination where memory and emotion can shape reality. The stories of Thelanis bring people together in a shared tale; by contrast, the dreams of Dal Quor are unique, individual, and fleeting. They're defined by our experiences and desires, and we rarely remember them when they're over. Dreams allows us to sift through our subconscious, and they are ours alone—or at least, they {@i should} be... if they aren't manipulated by an outside force. The denizens of Dal Quor reflect the secondary theme of the plane, and—for now, at least—that theme is nightmares. The quori prey on mortal dreams, twisting them to produce the emotions they crave. This doesn't mean all dreams are nightmares—but when a quori takes an interest in your dream, it'll usually become one.": "Dal Quor是梦境，一个想象力丰富的地方，记忆和情感可以塑造现实。Thelanis的故事将人们聚集在一个共同的故事中；相比之下，Dal Quor的梦想是独特的、个别的和短暂的。它们是由我们的经历和欲望决定的，当它们结束时我们很少记得它们。梦境使我们能够筛选我们的潜意识，它们是我们自己的--或者至少，它们（%0%）是......如果它们没有被外部力量所操纵。达尔-库尔的居民反映了这个星球的次要主题，至少现在，这个主题是噩梦。奎里人捕食凡人的梦，扭曲它们以产生他们渴望的情绪。这并不意味着所有的梦都是噩梦--但是，当奎里人对你的梦感兴趣时，它通常就会变成噩梦。",
	"Dal Quor is a place where impossible things are possible and the surroundings can change in the blink of an eye. What differentiates it from Kythri and Xoriat is that these changes are drawn from the minds of dreamers, both from the mortal subconscious and the ancient dreams of il-Lashtavar itself. Even when you're exploring someone else's dreams, your desires and memories can infect the landscape. The {@table Shifting Dreams|ExploringEberron} table provides ideas for how a dream could change.": "Dal Quor是一个不可能的事情成为可能的地方，周围的环境可以在眨眼间改变。它与Kythri和Xoriat的不同之处在于，这些变化来自于做梦者的思想，包括来自凡人的潜意识和il-Lashtavar本身的古老梦想。即使你在探索别人的梦境时，你的欲望和记忆也会感染景观。{@table Shifting Dreams|ExploringEberron}表提供了关于梦境如何变化的想法。",
	"The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the DM's discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature's dream that they're currently experiencing.": "达尔-库尔的环境可以在任何时候转变。这些变化通常来自当前做梦者的思想，但由DM决定，冒险者的思想可能会影响他们当前正在经历的另一个生物的梦。",
	"When a creature casts an illusion spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.": "当一个生物施展持续时间为1分钟或更长的幻术时，持续时间会加倍。持续时间为24小时或以上的法术不受影响。",
	"For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane. While sleeping for 8 hours, a creature could spend 3 days in Dal Quor.": "在达尔-库尔每过10分钟，在物质界只过1分钟。在睡眠8小时的情况下，一个生物可以在达尔奎尔度过3天。",
	"The layers of Dal Quor are shaped by dreaming minds. The quori believe the heart of Dal Quor is itself the dream of an immense, ancient spirit, and that they themselves are simply part of its dream. They call this the Quor Tarai—the Dream of the Age. But there's a catch: every dream ends when the dreamer wakes up. Forty thousand years ago, the giants of Xen'drik fought a war with Dal Quor—but none of the current quori remember this war or anything that happened before it. They believe this is because the Quor Tarai came to an end. Dal Quor woke from its dream, then immediately returned to its slumber and began to dream again... but it was a {@i new} dream, with entirely new quori.": "达尔-库尔的层次是由做梦的头脑形成的。科里人相信达尔-库尔的心脏本身就是一个巨大的、古老的精神的梦，而他们自己只是梦的一部分。他们把这称为 \"Quor Tarai\"--时代的梦想。但有一个问题：每个梦都会在梦者醒来时结束。四万年前，Xen'drik的巨人与Dal Quor进行了一场战争，但现在的Quori都不记得这场战争或之前发生的任何事情。他们认为这是因为Quor Tarai已经结束了。达尔-库尔从梦中醒来，然后立即回到沉睡中，又开始做梦......但这是一个{@i new}的梦，有完全新的库里。",
	"The quori call this transition the Turning of the Age. They don't know how many times it's happened before, and they know nothing about the quori of the previous age. But they believe that each incarnation of the Quor Tarai has its own distinct flavor. The present Quor Tarai is {@i il-Lashtavar}, the Great Darkness that Dreams. It's malevolent and cruel, and that's reflected by the quori it's created. But a handful of quori didn't fit in this dream. These are the quori that became the kalashtar, who consider themselves harbingers of transformation. The kalashtar believe that the next incarnation of the Quor Tarai will be an age of hope and compassion; they call it {@i il-Yannah,} the Great Light.": "Quori称这种过渡为 \"时代的转折\"。他们不知道以前发生过多少次，也不知道上一个时代的曲里人的情况。但他们相信，Quor Tarai的每个化身都有其独特的味道。现在的Quor Tarai是{@i il-Lashtavar}，是梦想中的大黑暗。它是恶毒和残酷的，这一点从它所创造的昆利身上反映出来。但有一小部分的quori不适合这个梦。这些是成为卡拉什塔的科里，他们认为自己是变革的预言者。kalashtar相信，Quor Tarai的下一个化身将是一个充满希望和慈悲的时代；他们称之为{@i il-Yannah,}大光明。",
	"So all quori know that one day, Dal Quor will wake from its dream, and when it does, all existing quori will be destroyed. This drives the conflict between the kalashtar and the Dreaming Dark. The kalashtar believe their devotions and meditation slowly turn the wheel toward a dream of light. Meanwhile, the agents of the Dreaming Dark believe they can permanently anchor the Quor Tarai in the current age, if only they can control enough mortal dreams—a process begun with Sarlona. It's up to the DM to decide if the kalashtar can usher in a new age over the course of the campaign, or if the Dreaming Dark will maintain the status quo. If the Turning of the Age occurs, all existing quori will be destroyed and reborn; no one knows what this will do to the kalashtar or foreign creations like the Uul Dhakaan.": "因此，所有Quori都知道，有一天，Dal Quor会从梦中醒来，而当它醒来时，所有现存的Quori都会被摧毁。这推动了卡拉什塔人和做梦的黑暗之间的冲突。卡拉什塔人相信他们的虔诚和冥想会使轮子慢慢转向光明之梦。同时，做梦的黑暗的代理人相信，只要他们能控制足够多的凡人的梦境，他们就能把Quor Tarai永久地固定在当前的时代里--一个从Sarlona开始的过程。至于卡拉什塔能否在战役过程中迎来一个新的时代，或者造梦的黑暗是否会维持现状，则由DM来决定。如果时代的转变发生了，所有现存的夸瑞将被摧毁并重生；没有人知道这将对卡拉什塔人或像乌尔-达卡安这样的外来造物造成什么影响。",
	"The quori, children of il-Lashtavar, are the most numerous of the native spirits of Dal Quor. But quori aren't the only creatures dreamers can encounter in the Region of Dreams.": "奎里是拉什塔瓦的孩子，是达尔-库尔最多的本地精灵。但是科里并不是做梦者在梦境地区能遇到的唯一生物。",
	"At any given moment, there are millions of dreaming minds creating islands in Dal Quor. Humans, orcs, giants, dragons—any creature that dreams can be found in this plane.": "在任何特定的时刻，都有数以百万计的做梦的头脑在达尔库尔创造岛屿。人类、兽人、巨人、龙--任何会做梦的生物都可以在这个平面上找到。",
	"A rare few dreamers are lucid and in full control of their actions, due to either training or magic; these are capable of leaving their own dreams and moving between the plane's dream islands and layers. However, the vast majority of dreamers aren't lucid. They're driven by their subconscious, and react based on instinct and deep desires; they likely won't remember the events of a dream clearly. Either way, when a dreamer dies in their dream, they wake up; however, this death can still have consequences, as {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} describes in \"The Dreaming Dark\" section of chapter 4.": "少数梦者是清醒的，并能完全控制自己的行动，这是由于训练或魔法；这些人能够离开自己的梦境，在飞机的梦岛和梦层之间移动。然而，绝大多数的做梦者都不是清醒的。他们受到潜意识的驱使，根据本能和深层欲望做出反应；他们可能不会清楚地记得梦中的事件。无论如何，当做梦者在梦中死亡时，他们会醒来；但是，这种死亡仍然会产生后果，正如{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}在第四章的 \"梦中的黑暗 \"部分所描述的那样。",
	"When you have a dream and you meet your old drill sergeant, it's not actually your old drill sergeant, and it's (probably) not a quori. It's simply a figment, manifested from the void by Dal Quor. When you wake up—or even just leave the scene—this manifestation vanishes, absorbed back into the essence of the plane. A figment can be anything—a friend of yours, a zombie version of that friend, a demon, a dragon—but the catch is that it's drawn from the mind of the local dreamer. When you dream about your old drill sergeant, they can't tell you a secret you don't already know, because they're part of you. On the other hand, if you're in someone else's dream—or if a quori has taken control of your dream—then the figments can surprise you, because their capabilities and knowledge are drawn from someone else's mind.": "当你做梦遇到你的老教官时，它实际上并不是你的老教官，而且它（可能）不是Quori。它只是一个虚构的东西，由达尔-库尔从虚空中显现出来。当你醒来的时候，或者甚至只是离开这个场景，这个表现就会消失，被吸收回这个平面的本质中。虚构物可以是任何东西--你的朋友、那个朋友的僵尸版本、恶魔、龙，但问题是它是来自当地做梦者的思想。当你梦到你的老教官时，他们不能告诉你一个你不知道的秘密，因为他们是你的一部分。另一方面，如果你在别人的梦中--或者如果一个夸父控制了你的梦--那么这些小人可以让你吃惊，因为他们的能力和知识都来自于别人的头脑。",
	"A figment could use the statistics of the creature it represents, or it might be limited, as the dreamer doesn't know what it's actually capable of. Conversely, a figment goblin could have the statistics of an ogre—in this dream, that's one tough goblin.": "塑像可以使用它所代表的生物的统计数据，或者它可能是有限的，因为做梦者不知道它的实际能力。反过来说，虚构的小妖精可能有食人魔的统计数据--在这个梦里，那是一个强悍的小妖精。",
	"Occasionally, a remarkable figment develops the ability to persist beyond the dream that created it—becoming a truly sentient spirit instead of a simple manifestation. Such figments might be useful guides or allies for mortal dreamers, or become predators that travel from dream to dream and prey on mortal fears. Such free-willed figments are called drifters.": "偶尔，一个杰出的虚影会发展出超越创造它的梦境的能力--成为一个真正有生命的精神，而不是一个简单的表现。这样的小人可能是凡人梦者的有用向导或盟友，或者成为从一个梦到另一个梦的掠夺者，捕食凡人的恐惧。这种自由意志的小人被称为漂泊者。",
	"The quori themselves are figments—figments of il-Lashtavar, the current Dream of the Age. However, these figments are immortal, and don't disappear when a mortal's dream ends; if they're destroyed, they're simply reborn within the heart of il-Lashtavar. Like other figments, they come into existence knowing the role they are supposed to play: they are shapers of nightmares. Each type of quori feeds on a particular emotion; tsucora quori craft terrifying nightmares so they can feast on mortal fear, while the du'ulora thrive on anger.": "quori本身就是虚影--il-Lashtavar的虚影，当前时代的梦想。然而，这些雕像是不朽的，并不会在凡人的梦境结束时消失；如果它们被摧毁，它们只是在il-Lashtavar的心脏中重生。像其他雕像一样，它们的存在知道它们应该扮演的角色：它们是恶梦的塑造者。每种类型的昆利都以一种特定的情绪为食；TSUCOLA昆利制作可怕的噩梦，以便它们能以凡人的恐惧为食，而DU'ULORA则以愤怒为乐。",
	"When a quori enters a dream, it can create new figments, alter the story's script, or change its own appearance (though its statistics remain the same). If the invading quori is killed within the dream, the story reverts to the original script, so most quori prefer to remain in the background while shaping a dream; however, some are arrogant and can't resist playing a starring role. The quori don't create every nightmare; there are millions of dreamers, while the quori number only in the thousands. But the nightmares they personally create are works of art.": "当quori进入一个梦境时，它可以创造新的形象，改变故事的剧本，或者改变自己的外表（尽管它的统计数据保持不变）。如果入侵的昆利在梦中被杀死，故事就会恢复到原来的剧本，所以大多数昆利在塑造一个梦的时候喜欢留在背景中；然而，有些昆利很傲慢，忍不住要扮演一个主演角色。Quori并不创造每一个恶梦；有数以百万计的做梦者，而quori的数量只有数千人。但他们亲自创造的恶梦是艺术作品。",
	"In the first days of il-Lashtavar, the quori had no purpose aside from preying on mortal dreams. Now they believe they're fighting for their survival, and they use their abilities to manipulate mortals and the waking world. But always remember that the quori began as crafters of nightmares, and consider how each quori's favorite emotion may color its actions.": "在il-Lashtavar的最初日子里，除了掠夺凡人的梦境之外，quori没有任何目的。现在他们相信他们在为自己的生存而战，并利用他们的能力来操纵凡人和清醒的世界。但要永远记住，奎里人一开始就是噩梦的制造者，并考虑每个奎里人最喜欢的情绪会如何影响其行动。",
	"Some creatures in Dal Quor are neither figments nor mortal dreamers. Night hags freely come and go, collecting nightmares for their own purposes. Here are some other interlopers.": "达尔-库尔的一些生物既不是虚构的，也不是凡人的梦。夜行者自由来去，为自己的目的收集噩梦。这里有一些其他的闯入者。",
	"Taer Lian Doresh is a feyspire, one of the eladrin cities of Thelanis. Long ago, the tyrant empyrean Cul'sir cursed the feyspire and cast it into Dal Quor. Caught in the transformation of the Quor Tarai, these eladrin became embodiments of classic nightmares, and ease their pain by spreading fear among mortals. (They can be represented using shadar-kai stat blocks, but aren't shadar-kai and have no ties to Dolurrh's Queen of the Dead.)": "Taer Lian Doresh是一个火星，是Thelanis的Eladrin城市之一。很久以前，暴君帝王Cul'sir诅咒了费斯佩尔，并把它投进了达尔-库尔。陷入Quor Tarai的改造中，这些Eladrin成为经典噩梦的化身，并通过在凡人中散布恐惧来减轻他们的痛苦。(他们可以用沙达-凯的状态块来表示，但不是沙达-凯，而且与多鲁尔的死亡女王没有关系）。",
	"Taer Lian Doresh now exists between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. The eladrin of this feyspire can freely pass to both planes, but other creatures can only enter Taer Lian Doresh and return to their plane of origin; they can't use it as a portal to the other plane. Thus, quori and adventurers can walk the halls of the Fading Dream together, but the quori can't cross over to physically enter Eberron itself, nor can the denizens of the Material Plane (including eladrin of other feyspires, humans, and all other creatures of Eberron) enter Dal Quor.": "Taer Lian Doresh现在存在于Dal Quor和物质位面之间。这个火焰的精灵可以自由通过两个位面，但其他生物只能进入Taer Lian Doresh并返回他们的起源位面；他们不能把它作为通往另一个位面的门户。因此，奎利人和冒险者可以一起走在消逝的梦境的大厅里，但奎利人不能越过实体进入艾伯伦本身，物质界的居民（包括其他费星的精灵、人类和艾伯伦的所有其他生物）也不能进入达尔奎尔。",
	"Many dragons of Argonnessen believe they can attain immortality after death, passing through Dolurrh and becoming divine beings. However, some aren't willing to take that chance; using an eldritch machine hidden deep in Argonnessen, the most powerful can perform a ritual that tethers their spirits to a psychic anchor in Dal Quor. This Draconic Eidolon, a monument in the Ocean of Dreams, holds the souls of dragons long dead instead of releasing them to Dolurrh. The dragons no longer exist physically; like the Undying Court, they're a union of spirits, possessing greater power together than they would individually. They can't leave the Eidolon, but possess vast knowledge—secrets of history, insight into the Prophecy, and knowledge of epic magic. They have much to offer, but what do adventurers have that the dreams of dead dragons might want?": "许多阿贡尼森的龙相信他们可以在死后获得不朽，穿过多鲁尔，成为神圣的存在。然而，有些人并不愿意冒这个险；利用隐藏在阿贡纳森深处的长生机，最强大的人可以进行一种仪式，将他们的灵魂拴在达尔-库尔的一个精神锚上。这个Draconic Eidolon是梦幻之海中的一座纪念碑，它容纳着早已死去的龙的灵魂，而不是将它们释放到Dolurrh。这些龙不再实际存在；就像不死阁一样，它们是精神的结合体，在一起拥有的力量比它们单独拥有的要大。他们不能离开Eidolon，但拥有大量的知识--历史的秘密，对预言的洞察力，以及史诗般的魔法知识。他们可以提供很多东西，但冒险家们有什么是死龙的梦可能想要的呢？",
	"Dal Quor doesn't have layers like other planes. Instead, it can be seen as a vast ocean. When a mortal dreams, they fall into that ocean and create an \"island\": a dream pocket, shaped by their memories and desires. When they wake, this island disappears. So at any given moment, Dal Quor contains millions of islands, but none last for long. A passive dreamer can't leave their own island, but a lucid dreamer can find ways to travel between them. Typically this involves portals, doors within a dream that have a psychic connection to the destination—but it's also possible to break through the psychic border of an island, to fly to another island on a ship of dreams or an imaginary winged beast.": "达尔-库尔并不像其他飞机那样有层次。相反，它可以被看作是一个巨大的海洋。当一个凡人做梦时，他们会掉进这片海洋并创造一个 \"岛\"：一个由他们的记忆和欲望塑造的梦境口袋。当他们醒来时，这个岛就消失了。因此，在任何特定的时刻，Dal Quor包含数百万个岛屿，但没有一个能持续很久。一个被动的做梦者不能离开他们自己的岛屿，但一个清醒的做梦者可以找到方法在它们之间旅行。一般来说，这涉及到门户，即在梦中与目的地有精神联系的门--但也有可能突破一个岛屿的精神边界，乘坐梦之船或想象中的有翼兽飞往另一个岛屿。",
	"These flickering islands orbit the stable core of the realm, the dark heart of the Quor Tarai. In addition to the regions discussed below, there may be other permanent islands in the Ocean of Dreams, following the example of the Uul Dhakaan and the Draconic Eidolon. Who created the island, and what sustains it?": "这些闪烁的岛屿围绕着王国的稳定核心，即Quor Tarai的黑暗心脏。除了下面讨论的地区之外，在梦之海洋中可能还有其他永久性的岛屿，效仿乌尔-达卡安和德拉贡-艾德隆的例子。是谁创造了这个岛屿，又是什么支撑着它？",
	"A vast expanse of psychic space surrounds il-Lashtavar, home to millions of mortal dreams. The islands in the Ocean of Dreams range from the complex dreamscapes of sentient creatures, humans and dragons alike, to the simple dream of a dog that's imagining chasing a ball. From the outside, these islands appear as glittering bubbles, each with an image of its dreamer within it. They're loosely arranged based on the physical location of the dreamer, so there's a stretch of the ocean that contains dreamers near Breland, another for Thrane, and so on—including regions for any dreamers currently on other planes.": "一片广阔的精神空间围绕着拉什塔瓦，是数以百万计的凡人梦想的家园。梦之海洋中的岛屿从有生命的生物、人类和龙的复杂梦境，到一只想象着追赶一个球的狗的简单梦境。从外面看，这些岛屿就像闪闪发光的气泡，每个都有一个做梦者的形象在里面。它们根据做梦者的物理位置松散地排列着，所以有一片海洋包含了布雷兰附近的做梦者，另一片是瑟兰，以此类推--包括目前在其他星球的任何做梦者的区域。",
	"Over centuries, the Inspired have built a network of monoliths in Riedra, psychic anchors called {@i hanbalani altas}. These allow them to control everyone's dreams over a vast radius. Dreams are typically tailored to the region, including local news and instructions. However, if they choose, the Inspired can broadcast a single dream to all of Sarlona. Within Dal Quor, this manifests as a distinctive region of the Ocean of Dreams—an array of hundreds of thousands of islands, dream-bubbles arranged in perfect symmetrical rows, with identical images in each bubble.": "几个世纪以来，受启发者在里德拉建立了一个石碑网络，被称为{@i hanbalani altas}的精神锚。这使他们能够在广阔的范围内控制每个人的梦。梦境通常是为该地区量身定做的，包括当地的新闻和指示。然而，如果他们选择，受启发者可以向整个萨尔罗纳广播一个梦。在达尔-库尔，这表现为梦之海洋的一个独特区域--一个由数十万个岛屿组成的阵列，梦泡排列成完美的对称行，每个梦泡中都有相同的图像。",
	"Jhazaal Dhakaan united the dar through an act of epic bardic magic. When the dar dream, they don't create their own islands in the Ocean. Instead, they are drawn to a vast, ongoing dream—the Uul Dhakaan, as discussed in chapter 4. This is a vision of what the Dhakaani Empire could and should be, and it encompasses many cities and fortresses. In addition to the spirits of dreaming dar, this enormous dream is filled with countless figments—both background soldiers, artisans, and facsimiles of legendary champions whose memories have been preserved. Most dar aren't lucid dreamers and they don't fully remember the time they spend in the Uul Dhakaan, but it reinforces Dhakaani values and traditions. If adventurers want to experience what the Dhakaani Empire was at its height—and what it could be again—they can find it here. Chot'uul guardians maintain outposts throughout the dream, along with a great monastery in the capital city. The magic woven into the dream ensures that the throne in the imperial palace remains empty—for now. But when a new emperor is chosen and has the support of the majority of the dar, they'll hold the throne in the Uul Dhakaan as well as in the Material Plane.": "贾扎尔-达卡安通过史诗般的吟游诗人的魔法行为将达尔人联合起来。当达尔人做梦时，他们并没有在海洋中创造自己的岛屿。相反，他们被吸引到一个巨大的、正在进行的梦想--乌尔-达卡尼，正如第四章中所讨论的。这是对达卡尼帝国可能和应该成为的愿景，它包括了许多城市和堡垒。除了做梦的达尔的精神之外，这个巨大的梦境还充满了无数的形象--既有背景士兵、工匠，也有记忆被保存下来的传奇冠军的复制品。大多数达尔不是清醒的梦者，他们并不完全记得他们在乌尔-达卡安度过的时间，但它加强了达卡尼的价值观和传统。如果冒险者想体验达卡尼帝国在其鼎盛时期的情况，以及它可能再次成为的情况，他们可以在这里找到。Chot'uul守护者在整个梦境中维持着前哨站，以及首都的一座大寺院。交织在梦中的魔法确保了皇宫中的宝座暂时保持空虚。但是当一个新的皇帝被选中并得到大多数达尔人的支持时，他们将在乌尔-达卡安以及物质世界中占有王位。",
	"The dark heart of Dal Quor, il-Lashtavar, is the current incarnation of the Quor Tarai. This vast dreamscape, orbited by the Ocean of Dreams, is the source and home of the quori. It's a menagerie of nightmares, a showcase of terrors that haunt the dreams of mortals. On the edges of il-Lashtavar, corpses dangle from the trees of a haunted orchard. Blood drips from the leaves of a terrifying topiary maze. While the basic form of these nightmares is stable, they feed on the psyches of nearby mortals. Adventurers walking through the orchard see the hanging corpses as the people they most care about, or even as themselves—whatever is most disturbing to each intruder.": "达尔-库尔的黑暗中心，伊尔-拉什塔瓦，是库尔-塔拉伊的当前化身。这个巨大的梦境，由梦之海洋环绕，是奎尔人的来源和家园。它是一个噩梦的动物园，是萦绕在凡人梦中的恐怖的展示台。在拉什塔瓦的边缘，尸体从闹鬼的果园的树上垂下。鲜血从一个可怕的拓荒迷宫的叶子上滴落。虽然这些噩梦的基本形式是稳定的，但它们以附近凡人的精神为食。走过果园的冒险者把悬挂的尸体看成是他们最关心的人，甚至看成是他们自己--不管对每个入侵者来说是什么最令人不安。",
	"Those who press through this outer ring of nightmares find the great fortress-city of the Devourer of Dreams, the kalaraq quori who coordinates the actions of the Dreaming Dark on Eberron. The quori spirits tied to agents of the Dreaming Dark and the Inspired can return here whenever they choose, reporting to the Devourer and coordinating with other quori. The flowing time works to their advantage, as an hour in Dal Quor is just a few minutes on Eberron. The fortress itself is ever shifting; it might be formed from black twisted roots, or the walls could be blood-soaked spiderwebs. At the very center is a pool of shadows. It's here that newborn quori emerge when they're reincarnated, and here that the Devourer of Dreams descends into the pool to commune with the Great Darkness.": "穿过这个噩梦的外圈，就能找到 \"噬梦者 \"的伟大堡垒城市，他是协调Eberron上的 \"梦境之暗 \"行动的卡拉格-库里。与 \"梦境之暗 \"的代理人联系在一起的奎利人的灵魂，以及受到启发的人可以随时回到这里，向吞噬者报告并与其他奎利人进行协调。流动的时间对他们很有利，因为在达尔-库尔的一小时在艾伯伦只是几分钟的事。堡垒本身是不断变化的；它可能是由黑色的扭曲的树根形成的，或者墙壁可能是被血浸透的蜘蛛网。在最中心的地方有一个阴影池。新生的奎里在转世时就会出现在这里，而梦想的吞噬者也会在这里下到池子里与大黑暗交流。",
	"Il-Lashtavar is the most dangerous place in Dal Quor. At any given time, there are hundreds or even thousands of quori here. The Great Darkness doesn't act directly, but its presence can be felt in how the environment shifts to showcase the nightmares of intruders. Dreamers who die in this place can be trapped the same way kalaraq bind the souls of their victims. Only the most powerful and prepared adventurers should enter il-Lashtavar.": "Il-Lashtavar是Dal Quor最危险的地方。在任何时候，这里都有数百甚至数千名库里。大黑暗并不直接行动，但它的存在可以从环境的转变中感受到，以展示入侵者的恶梦。死在这里的梦者会被困住，就像卡拉格人捆绑受害者的灵魂一样。只有最强大和最有准备的冒险者才能进入拉什塔瓦。",
	"In those regions of il-Lashtavar that appear to be outdoors, adventurers may notice a dark, nearly invisible moon in the sky. A sage with considerable skill in History or Arcana may recognize this as the moon Crya, thought to be destroyed in the Age of Giants. Perhaps it was thrown into Dal Quor and could somehow be returned, restoring the plane to its proper orbit—or perhaps this is only il-Lashtavar dreaming of the lost moon.": "在il-Lashtavar的那些看似户外的地区，冒险者可能会注意到天空中有一个黑暗的、几乎看不见的月亮。对历史或阿卡纳有相当技能的圣人可能会认出这是月亮Crya，它被认为在巨人时代被摧毁。也许它被扔进了达尔-库尔（Dal Quor），并能以某种方式被送回，使这个平面恢复到它应有的轨道，或者这只是伊尔-拉什塔瓦梦到了丢失的月亮。",
	"Ever since the Age of Giants, it's been nearly impossible to physically interact with Dal Quor from the Material Plane. This forces the quori tied to the kalashtar and the Inspired to act through mortal agents. The only denizens of Dal Quor that can easily enter the world are the fey of the Fading Dream. The plane is always remote; undoing this damage would be an epic quest, potentially returning the thirteenth moon to the sky. But even at a distance, Dal Quor can affect the waking world.": "自从巨人时代以来，几乎不可能从物质世界与达尔-库尔进行物理互动。这迫使与卡拉什塔和启发者联系在一起的奎利人通过凡人代理人行事。唯一能轻易进入达尔-库尔世界的居民是 \"消逝的梦 \"的精灵。这个平面总是很遥远；消除这种损害将是一个史诗般的探索，可能会让第十三颗月亮回到天空。但即使在遥远的地方，达尔-库尔也能影响清醒的世界。",
	"The primary way that Dal Quor manifests in the world is through dreams. Chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} discusses the roles that dreams can play in a campaign.": "达尔-库尔在这个世界上表现的主要方式是通过梦。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}的第四章讨论了梦境在活动中可以发挥的作用。",
	"The metaphysical damage caused in the conflict between Dal Quor and the giants of Xen'drik broke the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor. There are no naturally occurring manifest zones to Dal Quor, and even {@spell plane shift} won't allow travel there. However, though {@i natural} manifest zones don't exist, anything is possible with an eldritch machine, whether in the hands of the Dreaming Dark pursuing subtle conquest, or simply an eccentric artificer seeking the advancement of arcane science.": "Dal Quor和Xen'drik的巨人之间的冲突所造成的形而上的损害打破了Eberron和Dal Quor之间的联系。达尔-库尔没有自然形成的显化区，甚至{@spell plane shift}也不允许在那里旅行。然而，尽管不存在{@i natural}的显化区，但只要有长生机，一切皆有可能，无论是在追求微妙征服的黑暗梦想者手中，还是在寻求奥术科学进步的古怪工匠手中。",
	"While it's rare to encounter objects on Eberron that come from Dal Quor, the Inspired of Sarlona create objects using quori techniques. The primary substance used in quori objects is a form of solidified emotion called {@i sentira}. It has an opalescent, organic texture similar to polished horn; the color depends on the emotion used in its creation, and the wearer can feel that emotion as a constant background presence in their mind. As a material, sentira is light and extremely strong, similar to mithral; an agent of the Dreaming Dark might wear armor that's functionally {@item mithral armor} but actually made from sentira. Quori items generally enhance telepathy or other psychic effects; a {@item ring of mind shielding} or {@item crystal ball of mind reading} would be logical creations of the quori.": "虽然在Eberron上很少遇到来自Dal Quor的物品，但Sarlona的启发者们使用quori技术创造了物品。Quori物品中使用的主要物质是一种叫做（%0%）的凝固情感。它有一种乳白色的有机质地，类似于抛光的牛角；颜色取决于在创造过程中使用的情感，而佩戴者可以感受到这种情感在他们的脑海中持续存在的背景。作为一种材料，sentira很轻，而且非常坚固，类似于密特拉；一个做梦的黑暗特工可能会穿上功能上（1%）但实际上是由sentira制成的盔甲。Quori物品通常会增强心灵感应或其他精神效果；{@item ring of mind shielding}或{@item crystal ball of mind reading}将是Quori的合理创造。",
	"Chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War provides story ideas related to dreams and the Dreaming Dark. Adventures can also use the kra'uul and uul'kur from chapter 7 of this book.": "Eberron的第4章。从最后的战争中崛起》提供了与梦境和梦境黑暗有关的故事创意。冒险也可以使用本书第七章中的kra'uul和uul'kur。",
	"The adventurers discover their dreams all share the same figure, appearing regularly to each of them. It could be humanoid (a childhood friend, an old mentor), a shapechanging raven, or a talking purple cat. It was once merely a figment of one of their dreams, but it's become a drifter, able to move between dreams. It could offer advice, carry messages to characters when they're separated from friends, or warn of things it's seen in the dreams of their enemies.": "冒险家们发现他们的梦境都有一个相同的人物，定期出现在他们每个人的面前。它可能是人形的（一个童年的朋友，一个老导师），一个会变身的乌鸦，或者一只会说话的紫猫。它曾经只是他们其中一个梦的虚构，但它已经成为一个漂泊者，能够在梦境之间移动。它可以提供建议，在人物与朋友分开时向他们传递信息，或者警告他们在敌人的梦中看到的东西。",
	"A single fortress in the Uul Dhakaan has become infected by a daelkyr curse, turning the figments within it into aberrations. Can this be contained and cleansed before it spreads and destroys the dream itself?": "在Uul Dhakaan的一个单独的堡垒已经被daelkyr诅咒所感染，把里面的人变成了畸形人。在它蔓延并摧毁梦境之前，能否控制并净化它？",
	"Taer Lian Doresh exists on the edge of Dal Quor, where mortals and quori meet face to face.

	"Endless caverns stretch throughout Dolurrh, bleak passages of gray stone. Wherever you go, shadowy figures reach toward you, imploring, but you feel only the faintest chill as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Mist pools around your feet, and as you press forward, you realize this swirling mist is moaning. This is no natural phenomenon; these are the remnants of souls who have forgotten themselves. This is Dolurrh. It's not the embodiment of the idea of death or dying, both of which are reflected in Mabar. Rather, Dolurrh is where mortal souls go after their bodies die, where memories fade and lives are forgotten.": "无尽的洞穴延伸到整个多鲁尔，灰色石头的暗淡通道。无论你走到哪里，阴暗的身影都向你伸出手来，暗示着你，但当他们没有实体的手指穿过你时，你只感到最微弱的寒意。雾气在你的脚边汇集，当你向前走时，你意识到这团雾气在呻吟。这不是自然现象；这些是已经忘记自己的灵魂的残余。这是Dolurrh。它不是死亡或死亡概念的体现，这两者都反映在马巴尔。相反，Dolurrh是凡人的灵魂在身体死亡后的去处，在那里记忆消逝，生命被遗忘。",
	"Mortal spirits are drawn to Dolurrh within moments of death, and their memories begin to decay immediately. Within days, most spirits no longer have any desire to leave Dolurrh, and within weeks, most only have the faintest memories of their previous lives. The faiths of Aerenal and the Blood of Vol assert that Dolurrh is the absolute end of existence, the last echoes of a life before it's completely gone. But when Dorius Alyre ir'Korran drew his classic planar map (seen at the beginning of this book), he used the Octogram symbol of the Sovereign Host to represent Dolurrh, because he declared it to be the door through which all mortals must pass to join with the Sovereigns. This has come to be a common view: what appears to be memory fading is actually the soul slowly ascending to a higher form of existence, rising to a level of reality no mortal can experience. The Vassals of the Sovereign Host say the faithful finally join the Sovereigns; followers of the Silver Flame say that noble souls strengthen the Flame. What is left is only a husk—the cast-off remnants, like an abandoned snakeskin or the traces of memory that can be read using {@spell speak with dead}. Thus, while Dolurrh has long been known as the Realm of the Dead, many call it the Gateway. Ultimately, this is a matter of faith—whether the other side of Dolurrh is oblivion or paradise, no one ever returns from it.": "凡人的灵魂在死亡的瞬间就被吸引到多鲁尔，他们的记忆立即开始腐烂。几天之内，大多数灵魂不再有离开多鲁尔的愿望，几周之内，大多数人对他们以前的生活只剩下最微弱的记忆。艾瑞纳和沃尔之血的信仰断言，多鲁尔是存在的绝对终点，是生命完全消失前的最后回声。但当多里乌斯-阿莱尔-伊尔-科兰绘制他的经典平面图时（见本书开头），他用主宰者的八角形符号来代表Dolurrh，因为他宣布它是所有凡人必须通过的门，以与主宰者结合。这已经成为一种普遍的观点：看似记忆消退的东西实际上是灵魂在慢慢升华到更高的存在形式，上升到凡人无法体验的现实层面。主宰者的附庸们说，信徒们最终加入了主宰者；银色火焰的追随者说，高贵的灵魂加强了火焰。留下的只是一个外壳--被抛弃的残余物，就像被遗弃的蛇皮或可以用（%0%）读取的记忆的痕迹。因此，虽然Dolurrh长期以来被称为死者之境，但许多人称它为门户。归根结底，这是一个信仰问题--无论多鲁尔的另一面是遗忘还是天堂，都没有人从那里回来。",
	"The sage Annolysse of Arcanix declared that Dolurrh must be the thirteenth plane, for it has no opposite. It doesn't embody an idea so much as it serves a purpose—that of gathering, collecting, and (perhaps) transitioning souls. Mortal actions are judged in Daanvi; by contrast, Dolurrh doesn't judge and it doesn't punish. It's simply the end of the journey—or depending how you look at it, the beginning of a new one.": "Arcanix的圣人Annolysse宣称，Dolurrh必须是第十三层，因为它没有反面。它并不体现一种思想，而是为一种目的服务--那就是聚集、收集和（也许）过渡灵魂。凡人的行为在Daanvi受到审判；相比之下，Dolurrh不审判也不惩罚。它只是旅程的结束--或者取决于你如何看待它，一个新旅程的开始。",
	"All living creatures come to Dolurrh, sooner or later. Those that come here before death are almost always looking for something—a lost soul, a forgotten memory. But living or dead, any who come to Dolurrh can be trapped by its power.": "所有的生物都会来Dolurrh，迟早的事。那些在死前来到这里的人几乎总是在寻找什么--失去的灵魂，被遗忘的记忆。但不管是活人还是死人，任何来到多鲁尔的人都会被它的力量所困。",
	"Everything about Dolurrh is gray and gloomy. Even the brightest colors seem faded, the most joyful sounds seem dull. The heavy weight of ennui settles on travelers the moment they arrive, making even the simplest tasks feel challenging. And there's a constant pull, tugging on memory and emotion, a desire to just sit down and let it all go.": "多鲁尔的一切都显得灰暗和阴郁。即使是最明亮的颜色也似乎已经褪色，最欢快的声音也显得沉闷。旅行者一到这里，就被沉重的忧郁所笼罩，即使是最简单的任务也觉得具有挑战性。有一种持续的拉力，牵引着记忆和情感，让人想坐下来，让一切都过去。",
	"When a creature enters Dolurrh, it immediately gains one level of ennui (described in the \"Ennui\" sidebar). While in Dolurrh, this level of ennui can't be removed by rest or by any other means. It's immediately removed when the creature leaves Dolurrh. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property's effects.": "当一个生物进入Dolurrh时，它立即获得一个等级的迷惘（在 \"迷惘 \"侧边栏中描述）。在Dolurrh中时，这个等级的迷失不能通过休息或任何其他方式消除。当生物离开Dolurrh时，它将立即被移除。土生土长的Dolurrh的生物对这个属性的效果免疫。",
	"In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell.

	"Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it gains one level of ennui. Each time it makes this saving throw, the DC increases by 1. Whenever a creature ends a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, it must make this saving throw as if it had just finished a rest, but its roll is made with disadvantage. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property's effects.": "每当一个生物完成短期或长期休息时，它必须做一个DC12的智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，它将获得一个等级的厌恶感。每当一个生物在24小时内没有完成长时间的休息时，它必须做这个蓄力动作，就像它刚刚完成休息一样，但是它的掷骰子是以劣势进行的。多鲁尔地区的生物对该属性的效果免疫。",
	"Time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. Creatures can benefit from resting, suffer damage, and die. However, a creature on Dolurrh doesn't age, and doesn't need to eat, sleep, or drink.": "时间的流逝速度与物质界相同，并且在其各层之间是一致的。生物可以从休息中获益，遭受伤害，并死亡。然而，在Dolurrh上的生物不会衰老，也不需要吃、睡、喝。",
	"Ennui drains motion and memory, reflecting the soul-sapping power of Dolurrh. This special condition is measured in levels, and has the same effects and rules as exhaustion (as presented in appendix A of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), with one exception—ennui affects all creatures that aren't native to Dolurrh, including undead and other creatures immune to exhaustion. Ennui is separate from exhaustion, and exhaustion levels don't stack with ennui. If a creature has both ennui and exhaustion, use whichever condition it has more levels of to determine the effects.": "Ennui会耗尽运动和记忆，反映出Dolurrh的灵魂侵蚀力量。这种特殊状况是以等级来衡量的，其效果和规则与衰竭相同（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}附录A所述），但有一个例外--ennui会影响所有不是Dolurrh本地的生物，包括亡灵和其他对衰竭免疫的生物。厌恶与疲惫是分开的，疲惫的等级不会与厌恶叠加。如果一个生物同时拥有苦闷和疲惫，则使用它拥有更多等级的条件来决定其效果。",
	"Undead can't recover from ennui while in Dolurrh. Whenever a living creature with 2 or more levels of ennui finishes a long rest, if it succeeds against its saving throw against Dolurrh's Inevitable Entrapment property by 5 or more, it reduces its ennui level by 1. When a creature leaves Dolurrh, all levels of ennui are removed.": "在Dolurrh中，亡灵无法从沉迷中恢复。每当一个有2级或更多迷失等级的生物完成一个长时间的休息时，如果它对Dolurrh的不可避免的禁锢属性的救赎成功了5次或更多，它的迷失等级就会降低1。",
	"When a creature reaches 6 levels of ennui, its will is completely broken and it can take no purposeful action; if this happens to a living creature, its physical body dies and it becomes a husk bound to Dolurrh.": "当一个生物达到6级沉迷状态时，它的意志就会完全崩溃，不能采取任何有目的的行动；如果这种情况发生在一个生物身上，它的肉体就会死亡，成为被Dolurrh束缚的躯壳。",

	"{@creature Marut} inevitables are powerful guardians, crafted in the Crucible of Dolurrh, forged from husksteel, and tasked to preserve the cycle of life and death. Maruts are occasionally dispatched to Eberron to intervene with acts of resurrection, or when a lich or mummy is created. No one's sure what triggers this deadly intervention—perhaps the resurrection defied the Prophecy—but Jorasco healers always cast augury before raising the dead. If the result is \"woe,\" they refuse the job, lest a Dolurrhi marut appear, destroying the resurrected creature, its healer, and possibly the whole healing house in the process.": "{@creature Marut}inevitables是强大的守护者，在Dolurrh坩埚中制作，由沙壳钢锻造而成，任务是保护生命和死亡的循环。Maruts偶尔会被派往Eberron，干预复活行为，或者当巫师或木乃伊被创造出来时。没有人确定是什么触发了这种致命的干预--也许是复活违背了预言--但乔拉斯科的治疗师总是在复活死者之前施放预言。如果结果是 \"悲哀\"，他们就会拒绝这项工作，以免Dolurrhi marut出现，摧毁复活的生物、它的治疗者，以及可能在这个过程中摧毁整个治疗室。",
	"{@race elf (shadar-kai)|MTF|Shadar-kai} are servants of the Queen of the Dead, shades granted new life. Though their new forms appear elf-like, they might've been any sort of humanoid in their previous life; when they caught the Queen's attention, she preserved their soul from entrapment. The shadar-kai serve in the Vault of Memories, and occasionally as her hands on Eberron. They might clash with necromancers (especially the agents of Lady Illmarrow), collect trinkets, or target mortals with no rhyme or reason. Many sages attempt to explain these enigmatic actions, often speculating that they're collecting especially tragic memories for the Vault.": "{@race elf (shadar-kai)|MTF|Shadar-kai}是亡灵女王的仆人，被赋予新的生命的阴影。虽然他们的新形态看起来像精灵，但他们在前世可能是任何一种人形生物；当他们引起女王的注意时，她就把他们的灵魂从禁锢中保存下来。沙达凯在记忆之库中服务，偶尔也会作为她的手在埃伯龙上服务。他们可能会与死灵法师（尤其是伊尔马罗夫人的代理人）发生冲突，收集饰品，或者毫无理由地针对凡人。许多圣人试图解释这些神秘的行为，常常猜测他们在为金库收集特别悲惨的记忆。",

	"The spirits of those who have died are omnipresent in Dolurrh, from shades huddled in the shadows to layers of moaning mist. The Dead might be considered manifestations of Dolurrh, but the plane didn't actually create them—all were once mortals. Shades are mortal souls that are freshly arrived in Dolurrh. They maintain a portion of their memory and original appearance, though they're insubstantial and can't interact with material objects.": "死者的灵魂在多鲁尔无处不在，从蜷缩在阴影中的阴影到一层层呻吟的雾气。亡灵可能被认为是多鲁尔的表现，但这个平面实际上并没有创造他们--他们都曾经是凡人。阴影是刚到多鲁尔的凡人灵魂。他们保持着一部分记忆和原来的样子，尽管他们没有实体，不能与物质物体互动。",
	"{@b Shades} are susceptible to ennui, and as they gain levels, their appearance blurs and their memories slowly fade. Shades can speak, and they may cry or beg adventurers to help them; however, most are incapable of taking any actions on their own. They're often found lost in thought, trying to remember something they've forgotten, or fixating on a past mistake.": "{@b Shades}很容易受到厌烦情绪的影响，随着他们等级的提高，他们的外表会变得模糊，记忆也会慢慢消退。阴影可以说话，他们可能会哭泣或乞求冒险者帮助他们；然而，大多数人没有能力自己采取任何行动。他们经常被发现迷失在思考中，试图记住一些他们已经忘记的事情，或者沉浸在过去的错误中。",
	"{@b Husks} are harmless shades that have been overcome by ennui and possess only the vaguest memories of their mortal existence. Most retain a semblance of their mortal shape, but they continue to fade over decades, eventually merging with other husks to form masses of moaning mist. Having no true consciousness of their own, husks are immune to ennui's effects. Occasionally, a group of husks cluster around a strong memory, forming an ectoplasmic mass that prowls in search of more scraps of memory, absorbing other husks. Such a creature is called a meld, and its statistics are provided in chapter 8.": "{@b Husks}是无害的影子，已经被厌恶感所征服，只拥有他们在凡间存在的最模糊的记忆。大多数人保留了他们凡人的外形，但他们在几十年后继续消退，最终与其他沙士合并，形成大量的呻吟的雾。由于没有自己的真正意识，哈士奇对安乐死的影响是免疫的。偶尔，一群哈士奇会聚集在一段强烈的记忆周围，形成一个外质体，四处寻找更多的记忆碎片，吸收其他哈士奇。这样的生物被称为 \"融合\"，其统计资料在第8章中提供。",
	"{@creature ghost||Ghosts} are formed when a shade clings to a particular memory with such intensity that even Dolurrh can't completely eradicate it—perhaps a terrible mistake or a bitter grudge. The rest of the spirit's memories fade, and it becomes immune to ennui, but this ember remains, defining its existence. Ghosts are driven by a primal desire to return to Eberron, to haunt the place where they died or where their anchoring memory was forged; they might escape to the Material Plane when Dolurrh is coterminous or when a resurrection goes wrong. Ghosts that are destroyed eventually reform; they can only find peace if their unfinished business is resolved.": "{@creature ghost||Ghosts}的形成是当一个阴魂紧紧抓住一个特定的记忆，其强度之大，甚至连Dolurrh都无法完全消除它--也许是一个可怕的错误或一个痛苦的怨恨。灵魂的其他记忆会逐渐消失，并且对厌恶感免疫，但这个微光仍然存在，决定了它的存在。鬼魂被一种原始的欲望所驱使，想要回到Eberron，萦绕在他们死亡的地方或者他们的锚定记忆被铸造的地方；当Dolurrh同构时或者当复活出错时，他们可能会逃到物质世界。被毁灭的鬼魂最终会改过自新；只有当他们未完成的事业得到解决时，他们才能找到平静。",
	"Other forms of undead are rarely seen in Dolurrh. The entities found in this plane are the spirits of the dead, slowly fading, transitioning—or trapped in that process.

	"Memories of joy and happiness do no harm in Dolurrh. But memories of pain, of cruelty, of anger... these don't fade so easily, and they can hurt others. Even if they don't trap shades as ghosts, this psychic residue can build up in the gears of the spiritual machinery of Dolurrh. It often takes the presence of a mortal to trigger it; when this occurs, the lingering pain and hate coalesces into a solid form. The least of these are lemures, formed from hateful memories or deeds. The emotional residue of hundreds or thousands of people can form deadly sorrowsworn—the Angry, the Hungry, the Lonely, the Lost, and the Wretched—as presented in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}. The Lingering are formed in Dolurrh and are immune to ennui, but they're a waste product, not the plane's desired result.

	"The Queen of the Dead, the most powerful being in Dolurrh, dwells in the great spire that rises up above the Vault of Memories. Little is known about her motives or her origins; curiously, she focuses on the Material Plane far more than most great planar powers do. Though she existed long before the elves, the Queen appears as an elf woman, her face hidden by a cracked alabaster mask, her robes of black feathers trimmed with silver. She can pluck shades from the cycle of entrapment, and even grant them new life, creating shadar-kai by housing them in new bodies. Other souls, she saves but doesn't restore, preserving them in the Vault of Memories. She collects secrets and memories, plucking her favorites from those gathered by the Librarian and keeping them in her personal collection. Sometimes she directly opposes mortal necromancers, especially Lady Illmarrow. At other times, she seems interested in killing specific people, perhaps so she can preserve their spirits or their memories. But such direct action is extremely rare, remarkable if it occurs more than once in a century; most of the time, she remains silent in Dolurrh, unknown and unknowable.": "亡灵女王是多鲁尔最强大的存在，她居住在记忆之库上方的巨大尖塔里。人们对她的动机和起源知之甚少；奇怪的是，她对物质世界的关注远远超过大多数伟大的星球力量。虽然她早在精灵之前就已经存在，但女王以精灵女子的身份出现，她的脸被一个破裂的雪花石面具遮住，她的长袍是用银色的羽毛修饰的。她能将阴影从禁锢的循环中拔出，甚至赋予他们新的生命，通过将他们安置在新的身体中来创造沙达凯。其他的灵魂，她拯救但不恢复，将它们保存在记忆之库中。她收集秘密和记忆，从图书管理员收集的秘密和记忆中挑出她最喜欢的，并将它们保存在她的个人收藏中。有时她直接反对凡人的死灵法师，尤其是伊尔马罗夫人。在其他时候，她似乎对杀死特定的人感兴趣，也许这样她就可以保存他们的灵魂或他们的记忆。但这样的直接行动是极其罕见的，如果在一个世纪内发生一次以上，那就很了不起了；大多数时候，她在多鲁尔保持沉默，不为人知，不为人知。",
	"Rarely, the bravest (and most foolish) of adventurers venture into the Queen of the Dead's realm, hoping to reclaim a lost spirit from Dolurrh. And rarely, they succeed, for she doesn't care if a shade or two are stolen every century, or even every decade. However, in the Age of Giants, the Cul'sir Dominion sent an army into Dolurrh to recover the spirits of a family lost in the Quori Conflict—none of them returned. The Queen's power cannot be contested in Dolurrh, and thieves who attract her personal attention find their shades torn from their bodies in the blink of an eye.": "很少有最勇敢（和最愚蠢）的冒险家冒险进入死亡女王的领域，希望从多勒尔手中夺回一个丢失的灵魂。他们很少成功，因为她不在乎每一个世纪，甚至每十年都有一两个阴魂被偷走。然而，在巨人时代，Cul's Dominion派了一支军队进入Dolurrh，以找回在Quori冲突中丢失的一个家族的灵魂--他们都没有回来。女王的权力在Dolurrh是无可争议的，引起她个人注意的盗贼会发现他们的阴影在眨眼间从他们的身体上被撕掉。",
	"Dolurrh is universally gray and gloomy. The accounts of brave explorers describe the sense of being underground, and no mortal has seen the moon or sky of Dolurrh. Unlike most planes, the layers of Dolurrh don't embody different ideas; instead, they serve different functions in this grand machine dedicated to processing souls.": "多鲁尔普遍是灰暗和阴沉的。勇敢的探险家的叙述描述了在地下的感觉，没有凡人看到过Dolurrh的月亮或天空。与大多数星球不同，多勒尔的各层并不体现不同的思想；相反，它们在这个专门处理灵魂的宏大机器中发挥着不同的功能。",
	"The four layers discussed below are the only ones described in the records of mortals who ventured to Dolurrh—and returned. But there could be more, as yet undiscovered, each likely serving a critical purpose. It's known that the Librarian has recorded the lives of dragons in the Vault of Memories; accordingly, sages theorize there may be a layer dedicated entirely to the spirits of dragonkind, which may linger longer than the spirits of simple humanoids.": "下面讨论的四层是凡人冒险前往多鲁尔并返回的记录中所描述的唯一一层。但可能还有更多，尚未被发现，每一个都可能有重要的用途。众所周知，图书管理员在记忆之库中记录了龙的生活；因此，贤者们推测可能有一层是完全为龙族的精神而设的，它们可能比简单的人类的精神更持久。",
	"Endless tunnels of gray stone wind through the Catacombs, the destination of humanoid spirits. Some passages are painfully tight, while others widen into grand halls with ceilings lost in darkness. The Dead are everywhere, shades pleading for release, husks keening in the shadows. The chambers of the Catacombs might contain vast wells filled with moaning mist, or nalfeshnees herding shades into pens and scraping lemures off the walls. The Catacombs may be larger than Khorvaire, or even Eberron itself. A mortal could wander forever through these winding tunnels—at least until they're consumed by ennui. However, there are junction points that transcend the logic of distance. If one knows the right symbols to follow, they can cross the vastness of the Catacombs quickly or pass to other layers—perhaps in search of a shade to rescue, as discussed in the \"Concerning Resurrection\" section.": "无尽的灰色石头隧道蜿蜒穿过地下墓穴，是人形灵魂的目的地。有些通道狭小得令人痛苦，而其他通道则扩展为大殿，天花板在黑暗中消失。亡灵随处可见，阴暗者恳求释放，沙哑者在阴影中呻吟。地下墓穴的房间里可能有巨大的水井，里面充满了呻吟的雾气，或者是纳费什尼人把阴魂赶进围栏，把墙上的雷姆雷特刮掉。地下墓穴可能比霍尔韦尔，甚至是埃伯伦本身还要大。一个凡人可以永远在这些蜿蜒的隧道中徘徊--至少在他们被倦怠吞噬之前。然而，有些交接点超越了距离的逻辑。如果知道正确的符号，他们可以快速穿越浩瀚的地下墓穴，或者进入其他层--也许是为了寻找一个可以拯救的阴影，正如 \"关于复活 \"一节中所讨论的。",
	"The Kennel is similar in appearance to the Catacombs, but contains the shades and husks of beasts and monstrosities, along with the nalfeshnee and maruts that tend them. Here, you'll hear the howls of fading wolf spirits, and see flocks of spectral birds flying through grand halls, along with larger and fiercer creatures. Beast spirits rarely linger long in Dolurrh, as most have fewer memories to erase. But all dogs go to Dolurrh!": "犬舍在外观上与地下墓穴相似，但包含了野兽和怪兽的阴影和躯壳，以及照顾它们的纳费斯内和马鲁特。在这里，你会听到消逝的狼魂的嚎叫，看到成群的幽灵鸟飞过大殿，还有更大、更凶猛的生物。兽魂很少在多鲁尔逗留太久，因为大多数人有较少的记忆需要消除。但所有的狗都会去多鲁尔!",
	"The Queen of the Dead might have created special servants that wander these halls, just as she made the shadar-kai. It's possible adventurers could be questioned by a clever raven with the soul of a poet.": "亡灵女王可能创造了特殊的仆人，在这些大厅里游荡，就像她创造了沙达凯一样。冒险者有可能被一只拥有诗人灵魂的聪明的乌鸦所询问。",
	"In this grand foundry, tended by shadar-kai and guarded by newly forged maruts, the immortal spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits into husksteel. From these lingering scraps of memory and emotion, she forges the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai, and creates the maruts from the husks of brave souls. She also creates smaller and stranger items from husksteel, as described in the \"Dolurrhi Artifacts\" section.": "在这个由沙达凯照看、由新锻造的马鲁特守卫的大型铸造厂里，被称为 \"灵魂史密斯 \"的不朽灵魂将消逝的灵魂的精华提炼成壳钢。从这些残留的记忆和情感的碎片中，她铸造了沙达凯的盔甲和武器，并从勇敢的灵魂的外壳中创造了maruts。她还用砻糠钢创造出更小、更奇怪的物品，如 \"多鲁尔希神器 \"部分所述。",
	"The Smith wears a mask of black steel and an apron of dragonhide. When forging maruts, she takes the form of a giant, and when crafting tiny trinkets, a gnome. It's possible that she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can replicate their works at her forge.": "史密斯戴着黑钢的面具，穿着龙皮的围裙。锻造马鲁特时，她会变成巨人的样子，而在制作小饰品时，她会变成地精的样子。她有可能收集了凡人工匠的记忆，并能在她的锻造厂复制他们的作品。",
	"The heart of Dolurrh is the Vault of Memories. This tower, carved up through gray stone, is larger than any of the great towers of Sharn. The lowest levels hold the Vault's library; here, the spirit known as the Librarian interviews each shade and makes a record of its life. His power is such that an entire life can be confined to a single large page. Every sigil inscribed holds a crucial memory, and if a creature is proficient in Arcana, they can read the symbol to experience that memory. The many floors of the library hold countless books of preserved lives, carefully tended by shadar-kai scribes. The Librarian himself is a massive hooded figure—his books are likewise enormous. It's said that he can be many places at once, allowing him to speak to every shade, capturing the story of its life, before it fades.": "多鲁尔的中心是记忆之穹。这座由灰色石头雕刻而成的高塔比沙恩的任何一座大塔都要大。最底层是金库的图书馆；在这里，被称为图书馆管理员的精神采访了每一个阴影，并对其生活进行了记录。他的力量是这样的，整个生命可以被限制在一个大的页面中。铭刻的每一个符号都有一段重要的记忆，如果一个生物精通阿卡纳，他们就可以通过阅读符号来体验那段记忆。图书馆的许多楼层里有无数保存生命的书籍，由沙达凯的文士们精心照料。图书管理员本人是一个巨大的蒙面人物--他的书也同样巨大。据说他可以同时出现在很多地方，让他能够与每一个阴影对话，在它消逝之前捕捉到它的生命故事。",
	"In the halls above the library, the Queen of the Dead keeps her many treasures. What seem to be obsidian statues are actually shades, crystallized to prevent them from being entrapped and lost in Dolurrh. Paintings and crystals contain memories that the Queen has chosen to isolate. Beyond these are countless trinkets and oddities, items collected by her shadar-kai over the vast scope of history. And higher still are the chambers of the Queen herself, where she usually sits in silent contemplation, listening to the whispers of the countless shades in her domain.": "在图书馆上方的大厅里，亡灵女王保存着她的许多宝物。那些看似黑曜石的雕像实际上是阴影，被结晶化以防止它们被困住并在多鲁尔中丢失。画作和水晶包含了女王选择隔离的记忆。除了这些，还有无数的饰品和古怪的东西，是她的沙达凯在广阔的历史范围内收集的物品。更高的是女王本人的房间，她通常坐在那里静静地沉思，听着她领地内无数阴影的低语。",
	"Returning life to the dead isn't a reliable service in Eberron. Many characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, from clerics to adepts of House Jorasco. But just because a spell {@i can} be cast doesn't mean that it {@i should} be cast... or that it will work if it does. The first and simplest limitation is time. The longer a spirit remains in Dolurrh, the more it falls under the sway of ennui. Any spell that returns life to the dead requires the spirit to {@i want} to return. Once the shade becomes a husk, it can no longer make that decision, and thus can't be raised or reincarnated. Most religions maintain that this happens because the true soul has moved on to a higher level of existence; who wants to be pulled back from a union with the Sovereigns? So you only have about a week or two—depending on the strength of the target's will—to pull them back. But even before that time, a spirit might choose not to return. What do they have to live for? Is it worth fighting the lulling ennui of Dolurrh?": "在Eberron，让死者重生并不是一项可靠的服务。许多角色都有能力施展必要的法术，从牧师到乔拉斯科家族的信徒。但是，仅仅因为一个法术{@i can}可以被施放，并不意味着它{@i should}可以被施放......或者说，如果它被施放，它就会起作用。第一个也是最简单的限制是时间。灵魂在Dolurrh中停留的时间越长，它就越容易受到沉迷的影响。任何让死者重获新生的咒语都需要灵魂返回（%2%）。一旦阴魂变成躯壳，它就不能再做这个决定，因此不能被复活或转世。大多数宗教坚持认为，发生这种情况是因为真正的灵魂已经转移到一个更高的存在层次；谁愿意从与圣主的结合中被拉回来？所以你只有大约一到两周的时间--取决于目标的意志力--把他们拉回来。但即使在那之前，一个灵魂也可能选择不回来。他们有什么理由活着？是否值得与Dolurrh的枯燥乏味作斗争？",
	"The second limitation is risk. Even if a spell is successful, Jorasco remains rightly concerned about whether that person is {@i supposed} to come back, or if it's their time to die—for if it's the latter, a marut may appear to challenge any resurrection. This is extraordinarily rare, but in part, that's because healers perform an {@spell augury} ritual beforehand and refuse to raise someone if there's a risk. Even if a marut doesn't intervene, there's a risk the resurrection could go poorly if Dolurrh is coterminous, perhaps calling back other spirits in addition to—or instead of—the person being brought back to life.": "第二个限制是风险。即使一个咒语成功了，乔拉斯科仍然正确地关注这个人是否（%0%）会回来，或者是否是他们的死期--如果是后者，一个Marut可能会出现，挑战任何复活。这种情况非常罕见，但部分原因是治疗师事先进行了{@spell augury}的仪式，如果有风险，他们会拒绝复活某人。即使Marut不干预，如果Dolurrh是同源的，复活也有可能不顺利，也许会在被复活的人之外或代替他召唤其他灵魂。",
	"The final limitation is the direct intervention of a higher power. The Queen of the Dead might crystallize a shade and prevent it from being restored, or catch a spirit that's about to be restored and set a price on its passage; a few examples are given on the Cost of a Life table. How long does the beneficiary have to settle their account? A day, a year, a lifetime? It's also said that the Keeper can snatch souls before they even reach Dolurrh; if this myth is true, such souls can only be recovered from the Lair of the Keeper in the Demon Wastes. The Keeper itself may or may not be there, but it's certainly the abode of a powerful dracolich!": "最后的限制是更高力量的直接干预。亡灵女王可能会使一个阴魂结晶，阻止它被恢复，或者抓住一个即将被恢复的阴魂，为它的通过设定一个价格；在生命成本表中给出了几个例子。受益人有多长时间来结清他们的帐？一天，一年，还是一生？还有人说，守护者可以在灵魂到达多鲁尔之前抢走它们；如果这个神话是真的，那么这些灵魂只能从恶魔荒原的守护者巢穴中找回。守护者本身可能在那里，也可能不在那里，但它肯定是一个强大的龙人的住所！\"。",
	"The flip side of direct intervention is that the Queen of the Dead (or another powerful entity) might offer to return a shade to life—for a price. This is a way to bring a low-level character back to life, despite their friends being unable to afford resurrection. {@table The Cost of a Life|ExploringEberron} table provides ideas.": "直接干预的另一面是，亡灵女王（或其他强大的实体）可能会提出让一个阴阳人重获新生--但要付出代价。这是一种让低级角色复活的方法，尽管他们的朋友无力承担复活费用。{@table The Cost of a Life|ExploringEberron}表提供了一些想法。",
	"If all else fails, there's one way you can always bring someone to life: go to Dolurrh, find their shade, and drag it back out to the Material Plane. It's simple—all you need to do is to locate a single soul in the endless Catacombs (perhaps with the help of a native guide, records in the Vault of Memories, or powerful divination magic), evade Dolurrh's many guardians, and return to Eberron with the soul in tow. If you succeed, the victim receives a new body, just as if you'd cast {@spell true resurrection}; and while Dolurrh's defenders will try to stop you from leaving, they won't interfere once you return to Eberron. It's theoretically possible to restore a husk in this way as well, though the resurrected husk generally won't regain its lost memories, even though it might learn new skills. As a result, it wouldn't do any good to bring back the Tairnadal ancestors or Galifar I; you could bring a {@i body} back to life, but it's not the original person in any meaningful way. This is why the Queen of the Dead (and perhaps the Keeper) preserves certain shades from decay—so that they might one day be restored, even after thousands of years.": "如果一切都失败了，有一个方法你总是可以让某人复活：去Dolurrh，找到他们的阴魂，并把它拖回物质界。这很简单--你需要做的就是在无尽的地下墓穴中找到一个单独的灵魂（也许是在本地向导的帮助下，记忆库中的记录，或者强大的占卜魔法），避开多鲁尔的众多守护者，然后带着灵魂回到埃伯伦。如果你成功了，受害者会得到一个新的身体，就像你施展的那样（%0%）；虽然多勒尔的守卫者会试图阻止你离开，但一旦你回到伊伯伦，他们就不会再干涉了。理论上来说，用这种方式来恢复皮壳也是可能的，不过复活的皮壳一般不会恢复它失去的记忆，即使它可能学会新的技能。因此，让泰尔纳达尔的祖先或加利法尔一世复活是没有任何好处的；你可以让一个（1%）的人复活，但从任何有意义的角度来看，它都不是原来的人。这就是为什么亡灵女王（也许还有守护者）保留了某些阴影不被腐化--这样他们有一天可能会被恢复，即使是在数千年后。",
	"Here are some ways Dolurrh can affect the Material Plane.": "以下是多鲁尔影响物质世界的一些方式。",
	"Manifest zones tied to Dolurrh rarely possess all of the plane's properties; travelers generally aren't entrapped by ennui simply by passing through one. But these zones are still close to the Realm of the Dead and exceptionally haunted, though not blighted, as Mabaran zones typically are. Shadows move in disturbing ways, and travelers may hear whispers they can't quite make out.": "与Dolurrh相联系的表现区很少拥有该平面的所有属性；旅行者一般不会仅仅因为经过一个表现区而被迷惑。但这些区域仍然接近亡灵之域，而且特别闹鬼，尽管没有像马巴兰区那样典型的瘟疫。阴影以令人不安的方式移动，旅行者可能会听到他们无法完全理解的低语。",
	"The restless spirits of Dolurrh yearn to return to the Material Plane, and it's easier for them to do so in manifest zones. They might manifest as ghosts, or animate the corpses of people buried in the zone, causing them to return as revenants or zombies. In some Dolurrhi zones, raising the dead can be dangerous; if spells or abilities that raise the dead are used in such a zone, roll on the Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps table to determine the result.": "多鲁尔（Dolurrh）不安定的灵魂渴望回到物质世界，而在显化区他们更容易做到这一点。他们可能会以鬼魂的形式出现，或者将埋葬在该区域的人的尸体激活，使他们以复仇者或僵尸的形式返回。在某些Dolurrhi区域，让死者复活是很危险的；如果在这样的区域使用让死者复活的法术或能力，请在Dolurrhi复活事故表上滚动以确定结果。",
	"Dolurrhi zones can also have positive effects. In many zones, it's easier to return people from the dead, halving the cost of any material components. In others, anyone can cast {@spell speak with dead} as a ritual that takes an hour to perform, as long as they have a personal connection to the deceased whose corpse they're questioning.": "Dolurrhi区也能产生积极的影响。在许多地区，让人起死回生比较容易，任何物质成分的成本都减半。在其他地区，任何人都可以施展（%0%），作为一种仪式，需要一个小时才能完成，只要他们与他们要询问的死者的尸体有个人联系。",
	"The most dramatic manifest zones are those that serve as gateways to enter the Catacombs of Dolurrh—and hopefully, to return. Opening such a gateway might call for a special ritual or significant sacrifice, perhaps under a particular alignment of the moon Aryth, or when Dolurrh is conterminous.": "最引人注目的显化区是那些作为进入多鲁尔地下墓穴的门户--希望能返回。打开这样的通道可能需要一个特殊的仪式或重要的牺牲，也许是在月亮Aryth的特定排列下，或者当Dolurrh是同位素时。",
	"Dolurrh has a slow planar cycle. Traditionally, once a century, it becomes coterminous for a full year. Fifty years after that, it's remote for a full year. It can also have shorter phases, tied to the movements of the moon Aryth.": "Dolurrh有一个缓慢的平面周期。传统上，每隔一个世纪，它就会变成同位素，持续一整年。五十年后，它就会遥遥领先一整年。它也可以有更短的阶段，与月亮Aryth的运动相联系。",
	"While Dolurrh is coterminous, it's easier for ghosts to slip from the Realm of the Dead into the Material Plane, especially around Dolurrhi manifest zones. Any spell or ability that raises the dead can also serve as a conduit for unwanted spirits; roll on the {@table Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps} table when any such spell is cast.": "虽然多鲁尔是同源的，但鬼魂更容易从亡灵界溜到物质界，特别是在多鲁尔希显灵区周围。任何使死者复活的法术或能力也可以作为不受欢迎的灵魂的通道；当任何此类法术被施放时，请在{@table Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps}表上滚动。",
	"While Dolurrh is remote, traditional resurrection magic, such as {@spell revivify} or {@spell reincarnate}, can't pull spirits back from Dolurrh. The only way to raise the dead in these times is by traveling to Dolurrh itself and pulling the shade back to the world, as described earlier in this section. Surprisingly, ghosts are also especially common in this time—but these aren't ghosts that return from Dolurrh. Rather, if Dolurrh is remote when someone dies in the grip of great emotion or with vital unfinished business, their spirit can more easily resist Dolurrh's pull, remaining on the Material Plane.": "当Dolurrh处于偏远地区时，传统的复活魔法，如{@spell revivify}或{@spell reincarnate}，无法将灵魂从Dolurrh拉回来。在这个时代，让死者复活的唯一方法是前往Dolurrh本身，将阴魂拉回世界，如本节前面所述。令人惊讶的是，鬼魂在这个时代也特别常见，但这些并不是从Dolurrh返回的鬼魂。相反，如果Dolurrh在遥远的地方，当某人在巨大的情感中死去，或者带着重要的未完成的事情，他们的灵魂可以更容易地抵抗Dolurrh的牵引，留在物质界。",
	"The most common Dolurrhi artifacts are creations of the Smith of Shadows, formed of husksteel, the fused essence of faded souls. Despite the name, husksteel can appear not only as dark metal, but also as slick black leather, dark iridescent cloth, or other substances. Such an object could be crafted from a single spirit—a dagger whose edge is forged from a single moment of pain—or from the emotional residue of multiple husks.": "最常见的Dolurrhi神器是阴影史密斯的作品，由husksteel形成，是褪色灵魂的融合精华。尽管名字是这样的，壳钢不仅可以表现为黑暗的金属，还可以表现为光滑的黑色皮革、黑暗的彩虹色布或其他物质。这样的物品可以由一个单一的灵魂制作而成--一把匕首，其边缘由一个痛苦的时刻锻造而成，或者由多个沙壳的情感残留物制作而成。",
	"In creating a husksteel object, consider the memory or emotion that's the heart of the item. For a magic item, this should reflect its purpose. A husksteel {@item cloak of elvenkind} could be formed from a secret. A husksteel variation on a {@item dagger of venom} might be formed from a moment of absolute terror; when its power is invoked, it could deal psychic damage and, on a failed Wisdom save, make the target frightened of the wielder.": "在创造一个砻谷物品时，考虑作为物品核心的记忆或情感。对于一个魔法物品来说，这应该反映它的目的。砻谷钢{@item cloak of elvenkind}可以由一个秘密形成。1%）的变体可能是由绝对恐怖的时刻形成的；当它的力量被调用时，它可以造成精神伤害，并且在智慧救赎失败时，使目标对施法者感到恐惧。",
	"Other Dolurrhi items are largely curiosities. The {@table Dolurrhi Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table provides examples.": "其他Dolurrhi物品基本上都是奇珍异宝。{@table Dolurrhi Trinkets|ExploringEberron}的表格提供了一些例子。",
	"Dolurrh can inspire many simple stories through its manifest zones and escaped ghosts. A husksteel trinket could provide a flash of memory that sets the adventurers on a particular path, and finding a way to rescue a shade from the underworld is always an epic tale. Here are a few deeper stories to consider.": "多鲁尔可以通过它的显灵区和逃脱的鬼魂激发许多简单的故事。一个沙石饰品可以提供一个闪光的记忆，使冒险者走上一条特殊的道路，而找到一种方法从阴间拯救一个阴魂总是一个史诗般的故事。这里有几个更深入的故事可以考虑。",
	"The Queen of the Dead is an enigmatic figure who wields great power in Dolurrh. But there's another being who uses this title: Erandis Vol, the last heir of the Mark of Death. Through her agents in the Order of the Emerald Claw and beyond, Erandis seeks to restore the power of her dragonmark; no one knows what godlike powers she might wield if she unlocks its full potential. Meanwhile, Dolurrh's Queen of the Dead seems to oppose Erandis, and often sends her agents—both shadar-kai and adventurers she's restored to life at a price—to interfere with Vol's schemes. This could be exactly what it appears; the Queen of the Dead may despise necromancers, and Vol is seeking to depose her. But perhaps there's more to it. Time works in strange ways when dealing with the planes and beings of vast power. Perhaps the Queen of the Dead isn't trying to stop Erandis, but guiding her down a very specific path. Perhaps Erandis will {@i become} the Queen of the Dead, in which case, she'll have always been her. Or perhaps that's what's {@i supposed} to happen, but there's a way in which it could still go wrong... which could destroy the Queen of the Dead and throw Dolurrh itself into chaos.": "亡灵女王是一个神秘的人物，在Dolurrh掌握着巨大的权力。但还有另一个生命在使用这个头衔。艾兰迪斯-沃尔（Erandis Vol），死亡印记的最后继承人。通过她在翡翠之爪骑士团和其他地方的代理人，艾兰迪斯试图恢复她的龙纹的力量；没有人知道，如果她释放出龙纹的全部潜力，她会拥有怎样的神力。与此同时，多鲁尔的亡灵女王似乎反对艾兰迪斯，并经常派遣她的代理人--包括沙达凯和她以代价恢复生命的冒险者--来干扰沃尔的计划。这可能正是它所表现出来的；死灵女王可能鄙视死灵法师，而沃尔正在寻求废黜她。但也许还有其他原因。在处理那些具有巨大力量的星球和生命时，时间以奇怪的方式运作。也许亡灵女王并不是要阻止艾兰蒂斯，而是在引导她走上一条非常特别的道路。也许艾兰蒂斯会（%0%）成为亡灵女王，在这种情况下，她会一直是她。或者也许这就是要发生的事情，但有一种方法仍然可能出错......这可能会摧毁亡灵女王，使多勒尔本身陷入混乱。",
	"The adventurers kill a nefarious villain that's long eluded them—but soon, their foe reappears alive and well. This happens time and again. How is the villain escaping from Dolurrh?

Either way, what can the adventurers do to lay them to rest once and for all?": "冒险家们杀死了一个长期躲避他们的邪恶的恶棍，但很快，他们的敌人又活蹦乱跳地出现了。这种情况一次又一次地发生。恶棍是如何从多鲁尔逃出来的？他们是作为死亡女王的代理人，还是仅仅找到了通往死亡之境的后门？无论是哪种情况，冒险家们都可以做什么来让他们彻底安息？",
	"When Dolurrh becomes coterminous, a powerful sorrowsworn emerges and devastates the region. The adventurers may not have the ability to defeat the sorrowsworn in battle, but if they understand the circumstances of its creation—the emotion that drives it and the event that triggered it—they might be able to disperse the deadly monster by defusing this emotion. When an adventurer touches—or is touched by—one of Dolurrh's Dead or Lingering, they might sense a flash of any lingering memory or emotion that creature possesses. Can this help them solve the mystery, or will they die in the attempt?": "当Dolurrh成为同位素时，一个强大的sorrowsworn出现了，并对该地区造成了破坏。冒险者可能没有能力在战斗中击败悲鸣者，但如果他们了解其产生的情况--驱动它的情绪和引发它的事件--他们也许能够通过化解这种情绪来驱散这个致命的怪物。当冒险者触碰或被多勒尔的一个死人或徘徊者触碰时，他们可能会感觉到该生物拥有的任何挥之不去的记忆或情感的闪光。这能帮助他们解开谜团吗，还是他们会在尝试中死去？",
	"There are many who believe that warforged are simply tools; House Cannith may be able to infuse something with life, but it can't create a soul.

Or could it be that warforged {@i recycle} souls, drawing husks drained of memory from Dolurrh and using them as a foundation? These questions are intentionally left unanswered; it's up to each DM to determine the true nature of warforged souls. But there's one simple fact: a warforged can be restored to life with {@spell revivify} or {@spell raise dead}. Which means that the answer must lie in Dolurrh, and someone—Arcanix? Merrix d'Cannith?

	"It's simple to say that Fernia embodies the concept of fire. The plane is filled with magma and flame, from massive volcanoes to cities eternally on the verge of being consumed by fire. But Fernia isn't about mundane fire; Lamannia is the source of simple, natural flame, and holds volcanoes and fire elementals. Rather, Fernia is about all the things we see in the flame, all the ideas it represents. It has layers reflecting wild destruction, where verdant forests eternally burn. It incorporates industry, with legions of azers forever toiling over fire and forge. And it reflects wild passion, burning emotions that can't be held in, and glorious spectacle; these are the realm of the efreet, the lords of the Sea of Flame, forever striving to outshine their rivals.": "简单地说，费尔尼亚体现了火的概念。这个平面充满了岩浆和火焰，从巨大的火山到永远处于被火吞噬边缘的城市。但费尔尼亚不是关于世俗的火；拉曼尼亚是简单的自然火焰的来源，拥有火山和火元素。相反，费尔尼亚是关于我们在火焰中看到的所有东西，它代表的所有想法。它有反映野性破坏的层次，青翠的森林永远在燃烧。它融合了工业，有永远在火和锻造中辛勤劳作的工匠军团。它还反映了狂野的激情、无法抑制的炽热情感和辉煌的景象；这些都是埃弗里特的领域，火焰之海的领主，永远努力超越他们的对手。",
	"Fire draws the eye and the attention, but where there's magma, there's also earth. The azers stand between earth and flame, harvesting the ore they feed to their hungry forges. And in the deep caverns, the dao polish jewels and admire their treasures. Even in these deep layers, the air sears the lungs of creatures that lack the proper protection, but for adventurers willing to brave the flames, wonders and wealth are waiting in the halls of fire and stone.": "火焰吸引了人们的眼球和注意力，但有岩浆的地方，也有泥土。阿扎尔人站在大地和火焰之间，收获他们喂给饥饿的锻工的矿石。而在深邃的洞穴中，道士们擦拭着珠宝，欣赏着他们的宝物。即使在这些深层中，空气也会灼伤缺乏适当保护的生物的肺部，但对于愿意冒着火焰的冒险者来说，火与石的大厅里有奇迹和财富在等待。",
	"The sweltering heat of Fernia can be deadly to unprotected creatures, and it burns through mortal metabolisms. The following properties apply to the entire plane.": "费尔尼亚的酷热对没有保护的生物来说是致命的，它烧毁了凡人的新陈代谢。以下属性适用于整个平面。",
	"All regions of Fernia are subject to extreme heat (as defined in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). In some areas of particularly deadly heat, a creature without protection must make a Constitution saving throw every minute instead of every hour. In addition, all creatures gain resistance to cold damage, and a creature that is usually resistant to cold damage becomes immune to it.": "费尔尼亚的所有地区都会受到极端高温的影响（如（%0%）第五章中的定义）。在一些特别致命的高温地区，没有保护措施的生物必须每分钟而不是每小时进行一次宪法救赎。此外，所有的生物都会获得对寒冷伤害的抵抗力，而通常对寒冷伤害有抵抗力的生物会对它免疫。",
	"When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals fire damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.": "当一个生物施展一级或更高等级的法术时，如果它造成火焰伤害，它就像在比所消耗的法术槽高一级的水平上施展一样。",
	"A creature has advantage on ability checks using tools (such as baking with {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, or forging an item with {@item smith's tools|PHB}) when it incorporates Fernian flame into its action in place of mundane flame.": "一个生物在使用工具（如用（%0%）烘烤，或用（%1%）锻造物品）的能力检查中具有优势，当它将费尔尼恩火焰纳入其行动中以代替世俗的火焰。",
	"Whenever a creature makes a death saving throw, it must make an additional saving throw, keeping the results of both rolls. In addition, when a creature gains a level of exhaustion, it gains an extra level; when it reduces a level of exhaustion, it reduces it by an additional level. In Fernia, whether you live or die, it's going to happen quickly!": "每当一个生物做了一个死亡拯救动作，它必须做一个额外的拯救动作，保持两个动作的结果。此外，当一个生物获得一个等级的疲惫时，它会获得一个额外的等级；当它减少一个等级的疲惫时，它会额外减少一个等级。在费尔尼亚，无论你是生是死，都会很快发生！\"。",
	"Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.": "时间的流逝速度与物质界相同，并且在其各层之间是一致的。",
	"Fernia is home to celestials and fiends, spirits that embody key concepts of fire and flame. But its primary denizens are elementals of earth and fire. There are no native mortals or manifestations in Fernia: the elemental population is set in stone, and when one elemental dies, a new one takes its place. This can take many forms; new mephits spring out of open flame, while the dao craft new azers out of bronze. But overall, the population is stable; when an efreeti pits two legions of salamanders against one another in a grand display, they know the salamanders will eventually be reborn.": "费尔尼亚是天人和魔鬼的家园，体现了火和火焰的关键概念的精神。但它的主要居民是土和火的元素。费尔尼亚没有原生的凡人或表现形式：元素的数量是固定的，当一个元素死亡时，一个新的元素会取代它的位置。这可以采取多种形式；新的梅菲特从明火中涌出，而道则从青铜中制作新的阿泽尔。但总的来说，人口是稳定的；当埃弗里蒂人把两个蝾螈军团对立起来进行盛大展示时，他们知道这些蝾螈最终会重生。",
	"The {@creature efreeti||efreet} are the brightest stars in the firmament of Fernia. They are aristocrats, dwelling in sprawling mansions and castles, attended by countless servants, dwelling amidst astonishing opulence. Fire consumes, and the efreet are masters of conspicuous consumption. They are passionate and wild, quick to both anger and joy. They are casually cruel, and can consume or destroy the lives of others even as they celebrate. However, the efreet aren't conquerors, for they already have everything they could possibly want; their elemental servants exist to serve them, and the efreet consider them to be casually disposable.": "{@creature efreeti||efreet}是费尔尼亚苍穹中最明亮的星星。他们是贵族，住在广阔的豪宅和城堡里，有无数的仆人陪伴，住在惊人的富贵之中。火会消耗，而埃弗里特人是显眼的消费大师。他们热情而狂野，愤怒和喜悦都很迅速。他们随意残忍，甚至在庆祝时也能消耗或摧毁他人的生命。然而，伊夫里特人并不是征服者，因为他们已经拥有了他们可能想要的一切；他们的元素仆人是为了服务他们而存在的，伊夫里特人认为他们是可随意处置的。",
	"The efreet have been competing with one another since the dawn of time. Passionate arguments can escalate into dramatic duels, and now and again, two efreet unleash their armies in a grand display of fire and burning blood. But by and large, the conflict between the efreet is social, as each strives to outshine their rivals. Efreet society is bound by an elaborate social calendar. At any moment in Fernia, one of the efreet is hosting a grand celebration. Sometimes there's a theme or explanation for the gala—the unveiling of a new work of art, the epic burning of an old piece of art, or the thousandth anniversary of an efreeti's last rebirth. Other times, the party needs no explanation.": "自古以来，伊夫里特人一直在相互竞争。激情的争论可能会升级为戏剧性的决斗，现在，两个伊夫里特人不时地释放他们的军队，展示他们的火焰和燃烧的血液。但总的来说，伊夫里特之间的冲突是社会性的，因为每个人都在努力超越他们的对手。埃弗里特社会被一个复杂的社会日历所约束。在费尔尼亚的任何时候，都有一个伊弗里特人在举办盛大的庆典。有时，晚会有一个主题或解释--一件新的艺术作品的揭幕，一件旧的艺术作品的史诗般的燃烧，或者一个伊夫里特人最后重生的一千周年。其他时候，晚会不需要解释。",
	"If an efreeti isn't hosting a gala, it's planning its next one—and always, always searching for ways to outshine every celebration that's come before. Often this is about working with the resources within the plane, pushing azers and dao to create new wonders. But efreet have vast wealth and the ability to travel the planes, and this can bring them to the Material Plane. If a celebration sports a flight of red dragons performing synchronized pyrotechnics, remember this—dragons aren't native to Fernia, and the plane doesn't have manifestations of creatures; thus, the efreeti hired those dragons from another plane. Imagine what it would take to convince dragons of Argonnessen to perform as entertainment! Efreet rarely have any reason to deal with adventurers, but if the characters do have something to offer—or if they're interesting enough simply to be invited to a party as curiosities—an efreeti can make it worth their time. An efreeti could also serve as the patron of a warlock—perhaps using the Fiend pact—giving the mortal power, but demanding that they always search for things that could give the efreeti an edge over their rivals in their endless social battles.": "如果一个伊夫里提没有举办晚会，它就在计划下一次，而且总是在寻找方法来超越之前的每一次庆典。这通常是指利用飞机内的资源，推动azers和dao来创造新的奇迹。但是伊夫利特拥有巨大的财富和穿越位面的能力，这可以把他们带到物质位面。如果一个庆祝活动有红龙飞行表演同步烟火，请记住这一点--龙不是费尔尼亚的原生动物，而且这个位面没有生物的表现形式；因此，伊夫里特人从另一个位面雇佣了这些龙。想象一下，要说服阿贡纳森的龙作为娱乐表演，需要付出多大的代价！？伊夫雷特很少有理由与冒险者打交道，但如果这些角色确实有东西可以提供--或者如果他们足够有趣，只是作为好奇心被邀请参加聚会--伊夫雷特可以让他们值得花时间。伊夫雷蒂也可以作为术士的赞助人--也许使用恶魔契约--给予凡人力量，但要求他们始终寻找可以让伊夫雷蒂在无尽的社会争斗中比对手更有优势的东西。",
	"While efreet have much to offer, any association with an efreeti is dangerous. They abide by the letter of any contracts they make, but adventurers would be wise to make sure a contract includes safety clauses. After all, efreet are spirits of fire, and they burn things they touch. They care about nothing save their own status and amusement, and destroy lives without a thought.": "虽然伊夫利特有很多东西可以提供，但与伊夫利特的任何联系都是危险的。他们遵守任何合同的条款，但冒险者最好确保合同包括安全条款。毕竟，伊弗里特是火的精灵，他们会烧毁他们所接触的东西。除了自己的地位和娱乐，他们什么都不在乎，并且不假思索地摧毁生命。",
	"There are a host of noble efreet in Fernia. Here are a few of the most prominent, including their public names they use with mortals—their Ignan names are far longer.": "在费尔尼亚有许多高贵的伊夫雷特。这里有几个最著名的，包括他们对凡人使用的公开名字--他们的伊格纳名字要长得多。",
	"tands at the top of the social order. He has assembled the grandest armies and enjoys displays of martial might, including exotic engines of war. His galas often involve gladiatorial matches or grand war games.": "他站在社会秩序的顶端。他组建了最宏伟的军队，喜欢展示武功，包括异国的战争机器。他的晚会经常涉及角斗士比赛或大型战争游戏。",
	"stands just below Ashalar in the social order and is determined to unseat her rival. She is cultivating the friendship of several dragons. She considers herself to be a connoisseur of art, and could take an interest in the work of an artistic adventurer.": "在社会秩序中，她的地位仅次于阿沙拉，并决心要推翻她的对手。她正在培养几条龙的友谊。她认为自己是一个艺术鉴赏家，可以对一个艺术冒险家的作品感兴趣。",
	"is the most cosmopolitan of the efreet. He has many friends in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, and enjoys betting on the outcome of battles in Shavarath. His appetite for gambling could draw the adventurers into his orbit, as he might make a wager with another immortal about the outcome of a particular adventure—then seek to put a burning finger on the scales.": "是伊夫里特中最国际化的人。他在西拉尼亚的无量市场有很多朋友，并且喜欢在沙瓦拉斯的战斗结果上下注。他对赌博的胃口可以把冒险者吸引到他的轨道上，因为他可能会与另一个不朽者就某次冒险的结果进行打赌--然后寻求把燃烧的手指放在天平上。",
	"Where do the many treasures of efreet come from? Who built their glorious city of brass? The dao are the answer to both of these questions. Azer laborers keep the foundries burning, but it's the dao who pluck wondrous jewels and pure adamantine from the primal earth, and it's they who craft the grandest and most remarkable wonders. Each dao has a particular specialty, a unique style of art or artifice. While they can craft artifacts that would be the envy of any mortal artificer, their techniques can't be easily replicated. Their work has an element of arcane science, but much of what they do involves channeling the essence of Fernia itself; a dao who settles in the Material Plane will find its talents more limited.": "伊弗里特的众多宝藏从何而来？谁建造了他们辉煌的黄铜之城？道是这两个问题的答案。艾泽尔的工人们让铸造厂继续燃烧，但正是道从原始的土地上摘取了奇妙的珠宝和纯正的金刚砂，正是他们制作了最宏伟和最了不起的奇迹。每个道都有一个特殊的专长，一种独特的艺术或工匠风格。虽然他们可以制作任何凡人工匠都羡慕的工艺品，但他们的技术却不容易被复制。他们的工作具有奥术科学的元素，但他们所做的大部分工作都涉及到引导费尔尼亚本身的精髓；定居在物质世界的道会发现其才能更加有限。",
	"The dao are more stoic than the fiery efreet, and don't throw extravagant parties. But they still engage in intense social competition with one another, striving to craft the most glorious creations. This doesn't necessarily mean their work is the most powerful; rather, it's about creating things that are most desired. The dao don't need gold, so the efreet usually pay them in barter, which creates a bizarre secondary market. The efreeti Raqashtar might offer a squad of elite salamander warriors in exchange for a wondrous crown; the dao has no use for them, but it knows that the efreeti Azhalar is collecting soldiers, so... ": "与火热的埃弗里特人相比，\"道 \"人更加坚忍，不举办奢侈的聚会。但他们仍然相互进行激烈的社会竞争，努力创造出最辉煌的作品。这并不一定意味着他们的作品是最强大的；相反，这是在创造最受欢迎的东西。道不需要黄金，所以伊弗里特人通常以易货贸易的方式支付给他们，这就形成了一个奇怪的二级市场。拉卡什塔（Raqashtar）的伊夫里特人可能会提供一队精锐的蝾螈战士，以换取一顶奇妙的王冠；大道对他们没有用处，但它知道阿扎拉伊夫里特人正在收集士兵，所以......",
	"Adventurers may seek out dao because of what they can do, but dao can also be interesting patrons. A dao may need some rare substance to complete its latest work, but it can only be obtained on the Material Plane—so it turns to adventurers to obtain it. Or a dao could even use a group of mortals as a focus group, seeking opinions on its latest work.": "冒险家们可能会因为道的作用而寻找道，但道也可能是有趣的赞助人。一个道可能需要一些稀有的物质来完成它最新的工作，但它只能在物质世界中获得，所以它求助于冒险者来获得它。或者一个道甚至可以利用一群凡人作为焦点小组，寻求对其最新工作的意见。",
	"Here are a few notable dao:": "这里有几个值得注意的道。",
	"sculpts fire, producing masterful artifacts and tools that channel or produce flame. She creates the majority of the azer, and she can create other elemental creatures, constructs, or unique blends between the two concepts. She's the foremost expert on elemental binding in the multiverse, though it would take a great deal to convince her to share her knowledge with mortals.": "雕刻火，制造出引导或产生火焰的高超人工制品和工具。她创造了大部分的艾泽，她还能创造其他的元素生物、构筑物，或者这两个概念之间的独特混合体。她是多元宇宙中最重要的元素束缚专家，尽管要说服她与凡人分享她的知识需要很大的努力。",
	"creates tools of war, from personal armor and weapons to grand siege engines. The efreeti Azhalar is his best client, but all of the efreet value his peerless work. He has spent eons trying to create the perfect sword, and often seeks out legendary blades on the Material Plane—sometimes to keep, sometimes to study for a few minutes, and sometimes to destroy.": "他创造战争工具，从个人盔甲和武器到大型攻城引擎。埃弗里特人阿扎拉尔是他最好的客户，但所有的埃弗里特人都重视他无以伦比的工作。他花了好几个世纪试图创造出完美的剑，并经常在物质星球上寻找传说中的剑，有时是为了保留，有时是为了研究几分钟，有时是为了摧毁。",
	"is the finest architect of the dao, and is responsible for most of the grand palaces of the efreet. She's always intrigued by unusual architecture and has visited Sharn a few times to study the towers.

	"Fernia is home to raw fire and earth elementals (though these can also be found in Lamannia), abstract spirits that want nothing more than to burn or surge. These primordial creatures are largely ignored by the efreet and dao, and they're driven by pure instinct. Elementals are Fernia's most common inhabitants; an efreeti wouldn't be a lord without subjects to lord over, and these lesser elementals serve that role. While humanoid in form, they're deeply alien, immortal spirits shaped by their element and driven by singular purpose. An azer lives for the forge, and a mephit delights in mischief. Most lesser elementals are content as long as they have the opportunity to pursue their purpose, but occasionally a lesser elemental unexpectedly develops a quirk that drives it to pursue a new purpose.": "费尔尼亚是原始火元素和土元素的家园（尽管这些元素在拉曼尼亚也能找到），这些抽象的精神只想燃烧或涌动。这些原始的生物在很大程度上被伊夫里特和道所忽视，它们被纯粹的本能所驱使。元素是费尔尼亚最常见的居民；如果没有臣民来统治，伊夫里特人就不会成为一个领主，而这些较小的元素就扮演了这个角色。虽然在外形上是人形，但他们是深深的异类，是由他们的元素塑造的不朽的精神，被单一的目的所驱动。阿泽尔人以锻造为生，梅菲特人以恶作剧为乐。只要有机会追求自己的目的，大多数低等元素都很满足，但偶尔也会有低等元素意外地发展出一种怪癖，促使它追求新的目的。",
	"The population of these elementals is limited, and thus their service is valuable to the efreet and dao. The efreet and dao often barter the service of their elemental subjects, sending them to allied or rival courts. Typically this doesn't matter to the elementals, but there have been a few cases of salamanders rebelling against a new lord or mephits playing tricks on their new comrades.": "这些元素的数量是有限的，因此他们的服务对伊夫雷特和道教来说是有价值的。易福瑞特和道经常以他们的元素臣民为交换条件，把他们送到盟国或对手的法庭。通常情况下，这对元素人来说并不重要，但也有少数情况下，蝾螈会反抗新的领主，或者Mephits对他们的新战友耍花招。",
	"Azers, mephits, and salamanders are the most common elementals, though others might be encountered somewhere in this plane.": "阿泽尔、梅菲特和蝾螈是最常见的元素，尽管其他元素可能会在这个平面的某个地方遇到。",
	"The dao craft {@creature azer||azers} from bronze and bring them to life using the primordial spark of Fernia. They are tireless laborers who love working with fire and metals. Dao may create the greatest wonders, but the azers do remarkable work—and far more of it. Azer are naturally gifted artisans, and can be assigned to any sort of task that involves fire. However, there are few things more miserable than an azer baking bread instead of working with brass.": "道的工艺（%0%）由青铜制成，并利用费尔尼亚的原始火花使它们获得生命。他们是不知疲倦的劳动者，喜欢用火和金属工作。道可能会创造最伟大的奇迹，但阿哲人的工作也很出色，而且做得更多。阿哲是天生的天才工匠，可以被分配到任何涉及火的任务。然而，很少有比阿哲人烤面包而不是与黄铜打交道更悲惨的事情。",
	"When encountered in the wilds, {@creature mephit||mephits} are capricious tricksters and their \"pranks\" can make life miserable for planar travelers.

	"The primary servants of the efreet, {@creature salamander||salamanders} can be found serving as soldiers or performing domestic tasks. For every salamander officer carrying an ornate spear, there's a salamander butler carrying a brass tray. Salamanders are extremely proud, and within their ranks there is great competition over rank and position. Most are dismissive of mortals, but they can be jealous of adventurers who receive too much attention or favor.": "伊夫雷特的主要仆人，{@creature salamander||salamanders}可以被发现作为士兵或执行家庭任务。每一个拿着华丽长矛的蝾螈军官，都有一个拿着黄铜托盘的蝾螈管家。蝾螈非常骄傲，在他们的队伍中，对等级和地位有很大的竞争。大多数人对凡人不屑一顾，但他们也会嫉妒那些受到太多关注或青睐的冒险家。",

Common demons include quasits (malevolent counterparts to the elemental mephits), vrocks with burning wings, and terrifying balors.": "反映了火的可怕的破坏力，无法控制的野火和使豪宅倒塌的火花。他们狂野而暴力，当冒险者与他们相交时，很少是一件好事。恶魔渴望烧毁所有奇妙的东西。有时，这导致他们把目标放在埃弗里蒂的大宅子上，但在同时期，他们也能影响物质世界中未被照料的火焰，或者偶尔会操纵凡人对火的粗心大意。常见的恶魔包括quasits（元素mephits的恶性对应物）、带有燃烧翅膀的vrocks和可怕的balors。",
	"represent the intentional use of fire as a weapon or to inspire fear—the burning iron used in torture, the screams of those dying on burning battlefields. Devils are rare and exceptionally cruel. They thrive both on causing pain and suffering in Fernia, and cajoling mortals into acts of arson or fiery torture in the Material Plane. Like demons, they can usually only influence mortals when the planes are coterminous, but occasionally a Fernian devil manages to slip through fire into Eberron. Imps, barbed devils, and pit fiends can all be found in Fernia.": "代表故意使用火作为武器或激发恐惧--在酷刑中使用的燃烧的铁，在燃烧的战场上死去的人的尖叫声。魔鬼是罕见的，也是特别残忍的。他们既在费尔尼亚制造痛苦，又在物质世界哄骗凡人进行纵火或火刑的行为。和恶魔一样，它们通常只能在两个位面共存的情况下影响凡人，但偶尔也会有费尼亚恶魔设法通过火焰溜进埃伯伦。小恶魔、带刺恶魔和坑道恶魔都可以在费尔尼亚找到。",

Campfire layers are safe havens, and a perfect place for travelers to rest.": "这些小层反映了火可以提供的舒适。篝火层可以是字面上的篝火，是最黑暗的荒野中的一盏孤灯。另一个篝火层是一家名为 \"第一炉 \"的旅店，天使般的酒吧老板阿什在壁炉旁提供温暖的饮料，旅店的名字就来自于此。篝火层是安全的避风港，也是旅行者休息的完美场所。",
	"Here are a few of the ways Fernia can affect the Material Plane.": "以下是费尔尼亚影响物质世界的几种方式。",
	"Manifest zones tied to Fernia often share one or more of the plane's universal properties. Those with Deadly Heat often have unusual volcanic or tectonic activity, and are generally shunned. However, House Cannith is always searching for Fernian zones with the Fires of Industry property; in addition to providing advantage on tool checks, these zones often allow artificers to craft enchantments that can't be replicated elsewhere (especially those tied to evocation and flame). A Fernian manifest zone can provide an unexpected haven in an arctic environment, or provide unusual geothermal benefits. In Karrnath, the town of Ember—on the edge of the Icetop Mountains—is renowned for its pleasant climate and thermal pools.": "与费尔尼亚相联系的表现区往往具有该平面的一个或多个普遍属性。那些具有致命热量的区域往往有不寻常的火山或构造活动，一般都会被避开。然而，坎尼斯家族一直在寻找具有工业之火属性的费尔尼亚区域；除了在工具检查上提供优势外，这些区域通常允许工匠制作其他地方无法复制的魔法（尤其是那些与唤起和火焰有关的魔法）。一个费尔尼亚人的宣言区可以在北极环境中提供一个意外的避风港，或者提供不寻常的地热效益。在卡尔纳特，位于伊克托普山脉边缘的微光镇以其宜人的气候和温泉池而闻名。",
	"While Fernia is coterminous, temperatures rise sharply, and warmer regions that would normally be safe can become extremely hot, taking on the Deadly Heat, Empowered Fire, and Burning Bright properties of the plane. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense flame can find themselves pulled through to Fernia itself.": "当费尔尼亚是同位素时，温度急剧上升，通常安全的温暖地区会变得非常热，具有飞机的致命热量、赋能之火和燃烧之光属性。在这些时候，在罕见的情况下，被卷入异常强烈的火焰区域的生物会发现自己被拉到了费尔尼亚本身。",
	"When Fernia is remote, intense heat loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat, as well as on saving throws against spells that deal fire damage.": "当Fernia处于偏远地区时，强烈的热量会失去一些咬合力。生物在抵抗极热的影响时，以及对造成火系伤害的法术进行救赎时，都有优势。",
	"Traditionally, Fernia is coterminous once every five years during the month of Lharvion, and it's remote once every five years during the month of Zarantyr (exactly two and a half years after it's coterminous).": "传统上，费尔尼亚每五年在Lharvion月期间同位一次，每五年在Zarantyr月期间远程一次（正好是同位后两年半）。",
	"The dao and the foundries of Fernia produce a vast array of wonders. Many of their creations are effectively trinkets, such as a gold model of a dragon that breathes actual fire. Others are far grander, such as {@item figurine of wondrous power||figurines of wondrous power}. While many Fernian artifacts relate to fire in some way—{@item wand of fireballs||wands of fireball}, {@item flame tongue} swords—they aren't limited to fire or evocation. Fernian items are often made from brass, obsidian, or basalt, but the dao work with all metals.": "费尔尼亚的道和铸造厂生产了大量的奇迹。他们的许多作品都是有效的小玩意，比如一个会喷火的黄金龙模型。其他的则要宏大得多，比如（%0%）。虽然许多费尔尼安人的工艺品以某种方式与火有关--{@item wand of fireballs||wands of fireball}、{@item flame tongue}剑--但他们并不局限于火或召唤。费尔尼安人的物品通常由黄铜、黑曜石或玄武岩制成，但道教对所有金属都有作用。",
	"Two additional resources from Fernia are {@i cold fire} and {@i Fernian ashes}. {@i Cold fire} is a form of {@spell continual flame} that occurs naturally in Fernia; the flames have the texture of warm putty. {@i Fernian ashes} are created from the wood of rare trees found only in the Sea of Fire. {@i Fernian ashes} are a potent component of magic items tied to the evocation school. In addition, if a spellcaster discards a pinch of {@i Fernian ashes} while casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, their spell deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. Both {@i Fernian ashes} and {@i cold fire} can occasionally be harvested from Fernian manifest zones, though not all trees will produce {@i Fernian ashes.}": "费尔尼亚的两种额外资源是（%0%）和（%1%）。{@i Cold fire}是一种在费尔尼亚自然形成的{@spell continual flame}；火焰的质地像温暖的油灰。 {@i Fernian ashes}是由只在火海发现的稀有树木的木材制成。{@i Fernian ashes}是与召唤学派相关的魔法物品的有力组成部分。此外，如果施法者在施放一级或更高级别的火系伤害的法术时丢弃一撮（%6%），他们的法术会造成火系伤害，就像它的施法等级比所消耗的法术槽高一级一样。{@i Fernian ashes}和{@i cold fire}都可以偶尔从费尔尼安的显露区收获，但不是所有的树都会产生{@i Fernian ashes.}",
	"Fernia is difficult to reach and dangerous to visit, but here are a few ideas that might spark adventures related to that plane.": "费尔尼亚很难到达，访问也很危险，但这里有一些想法，可能会引发与该飞机有关的冒险。",
	"The Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall is determined to unseat the Sultan Azhalar with her next gala. And what's in fashion at the moment? Adventurers. The Pasha whisks the adventurers to Fernia, promising to reward them well if they make the gala a success—and to throw them into the Sea of Fire should they fail her. Can the characters shine at a party of efreet and dao? Do they know which fork to use, especially when one of them is on fire? What happens when Azhalar's salamander general challenges a party member to a duel?": "火瀑镇的帕夏-沙什拉卡决心用她的下一场晚会推翻苏丹-阿扎拉尔的地位。而目前流行的是什么？冒险者。帕夏把冒险家们带到了费尔尼亚，承诺如果他们能使晚会成功，将给予他们丰厚的奖励--如果他们辜负了她，就把他们扔进火海。角色们能在埃弗里特和道的聚会上大放异彩吗？他们知道该用哪把叉子吗，特别是当其中一把叉子着火的时候？当阿扎尔的蝾螈将军向党员挑战决斗时会发生什么？",
	"The adventurers stumble across an Emerald Claw camp. These Seekers are working with the dao Sar Saraen, who's building them a devastating explosive device capable of leveling a city. Can the adventurers find out why Saraean is working with the Emerald Claw? If the dao is being compelled, can they free him? If it's part of a negotiation, can they make a better offer? And what will they do if they end up with the completed bomb?": "冒险家们偶然发现了一个翡翠之爪营地。这些探索者正在与道士萨拉恩合作，萨拉恩正在为他们制造一种能够炸平一座城市的毁灭性爆炸装置。冒险家们能否找出萨拉恩与翡翠之爪合作的原因？如果道是被蛊惑的，他们能释放他吗？如果是谈判的一部分，他们能提出更好的条件吗？而如果他们最终拿到了完成的炸弹，他们会怎么做？",
	"The adventurers find a curious brass key. When inserted into a door, it transforms that door into a portal to the First Hearth, an inn in Fernia. Who does the key belong to? How often can its power be used? The barkeep Ashe is always happy to see a few new faces, but who else will the adventurers meet at the bar?": "冒险家们发现了一把奇特的铜钥匙。当它插入一扇门时，它可以将这扇门变成通往费尔尼亚的一家旅馆--第一炉灶的入口。这把钥匙是谁的？它的力量可以经常使用吗？酒吧老板阿什总是很高兴看到一些新面孔，但冒险家们还会在酒吧里遇到谁？",
	"In Irian, birds sing in a fertile valley, while a group of settlers work together to raise their first home. Moving further in, you find the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets. There are dozens of layers in Irian, and each one is a vision of life triumphant. Irian is the dawn that inevitably banishes even the darkest night, the promise of spring triumphing over the coldest winter. It's the bastion of hope, the promise that life always find a way.": "在伊里安，鸟儿在肥沃的山谷中歌唱，而一群定居者在一起工作，建造他们的第一个家。再往里走，你会发现一个新帝国金光闪闪的首都，欢呼的人群在街上庆祝。伊里安有几十个层次，每一个层次都是生命胜利的愿景。伊里安是不可避免地驱逐了最黑暗的夜晚的黎明，是战胜最寒冷的冬天的春天的承诺。它是希望的堡垒，是生命总会找到办法的承诺。",
	"In his {@i Planar Codex,} Dorius Alyre ir'Korran calls Irian the Plane of Light, and indeed, its light is so prevalent that there's no full darkness within Irian. But it's also the plane of life, the source of positive energy, the force that sustains life and underlies most healing magic.": "在他的{@i Planar Codex,}Dorius Alyre ir'Korran称伊里安为光之平面，的确，它的光是如此普遍，以至于伊里安内部没有完全的黑暗。但它也是生命之界，是正能量的来源，是维持生命的力量，是大多数治疗魔法的基础。",
	"The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. Irian has the following universal properties.": "永恒的黎明之光增强了生者的力量。黑暗和疾病在这里没有用武之地，轻微的伤害也会消融。伊里安具有以下普遍属性。",
	"When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points or deals radiant damage, it's treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.": "当一个生物施展一级或更高等级的法术来恢复命中率或造成辐射伤害时，它被视为以比所耗费的法术槽高一级的等级施展。",
	"In order to cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.": "为了施放一个造成坏死伤害的法术，一个生物必须成功地进行法术能力检查，检查的难度等于10+法术的等级。如果检定失败，该法术就不会被施放，其法术槽也不会被消耗，但该动作会丢失。",
	"There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness only reduces the lighting to dim light.": "在伊里安没有黑暗。任何通常会产生黑暗的法术、效果或其他情况，都只会将照明减少到昏暗的光线。",
	"Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This has no effect on undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.": "亡灵生物在攻击卷轴、能力检查和蓄力方面都处于劣势。这对由伊里安维持的不死生物没有影响，比如艾瑞纳的不死精灵。",

	"A living creature has advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and fear.": "生物对毒药、疾病和恐惧的救赎有优势。",
	"Most of the planes are fixed in their form; for example, every mortal brings new dreams to Dal Quor, but the plane's structure doesn't change. Mabar is an exception: the Endless Night steals and corrupts fragments of other planes, adding them to its layers. Left unchecked, Mabar would consume reality. But as the Endless Night consumes, the Eternal Dawn creates. Whenever Mabar tears a fragment from another plane, a new planar seed appears in Irian. Initially, this is a small layer, populated by embers and lumi, that has Irian's planar properties. Over time, the layer grows and evolves, and the environment and its inhabitants take on the appearance of the void it's to fill. Little by little, it loses the properties of Irian and adopts the properties of its destination plane; when it finally loses the Light of Life property, its ties to Irian are severed and it fully becomes part of the other plane, replacing the region lost to Mabar.": "大多数星球的形式是固定的；例如，每个凡人都会给达尔-库尔带来新的梦想，但星球的结构并没有改变。玛巴尔是个例外：无尽之夜窃取并腐蚀其他位面的碎片，将它们加入自己的层次。如果不加控制，马巴尔会吞噬现实。但在无尽之夜吞噬的同时，永恒的黎明也在创造。每当玛巴尔从另一个平面撕下一个碎片，一个新的平面种子就会出现在伊里安。起初，这只是一个小层，由余烬和卢米组成，具有伊里安的平面属性。随着时间的推移，该层不断成长和进化，环境和居民都呈现出它所要填补的空白的样子。渐渐地，它失去了伊里安的属性，并采用了其目的地平面的属性；当它最终失去了生命之光的属性时，它与伊里安的联系就被切断了，它完全成为另一个平面的一部分，取代了马巴尔失去的区域。",
	"The planar seed is rarely a perfect match for the fragment that was lost. The embers take the form of local life, but especially for fragments torn from the Material Plane, a planar seed doesn't replace sentient creatures or buildings; it simply restores land and wildlife. If the Mourning had been the work of Mabar—which is unlikely for many reasons, but not impossible—Irian wouldn't restore the people killed in the Mourning or the destroyed structures, but it would restore life to the land and make it a welcoming environment.": "平面种子很少与失去的碎片完美匹配。余烬采取了当地生命的形式，但特别是对于从物质界撕裂的碎片，平面种子并不能取代有生命的生物或建筑；它只是恢复了土地和野生动物。如果哀伤是马巴尔的杰作--由于许多原因，这不太可能，但也不是不可能--伊里安不会恢复在哀伤中被杀的人或被摧毁的建筑，但它会恢复土地的生命，使其成为一个受欢迎的环境。",
	"In most planes, immortals can't reproduce, but they're reborn if they die, and their numbers remain constant. Irian breaks that rule, because it creates new immortals to replace those corrupted by Mabar. These begin as lumi and angels, but as the seed loses its properties, these immortals evolve into the denizens of that plane, drawing their personalities from the template for the new immortals. Irian makes no judgment about the spaces it fills, and it may create a squad of bloodthirsty demons when it replaces a lost fragment of Shavarath. These seed immortals can't leave their layer until it's fully bound to their final plane, so they can't wreak havoc in Irian, but it would be quite a surprise for nosy adventurers that stumble into that layer!": "在大多数星球上，不朽者不能繁殖，但他们死后会重生，而且他们的数量保持不变。伊里安打破了这一规则，因为它创造了新的不朽者来取代那些被玛巴尔腐蚀的不朽者。这些人一开始是卢米和天使，但随着种子失去其特性，这些不朽者就会演变成该平面的居民，从新的不朽者的模板中汲取他们的个性。伊里安对它所填充的空间不做任何判断，当它取代沙瓦拉特的一个丢失的碎片时，它可能创造出一队嗜血的恶魔。这些种子仙人在与他们的最终位面完全绑定之前不能离开他们的层，所以他们不能在伊里安肆虐，但对于偶然进入该层的多事的冒险者来说，这将是一个相当大的惊喜!",
	"The creation of seeds is an important drive for the inhabitants of Irian. Immortals monitor and guide the formation of the seeds, while lumi tend the embers and prepare to {@i become} inhabitants of the new plane. Irian immortals rarely interfere in other planes, because what they're already doing is the most important task they could perform.": "创造种子是伊里安居民的一个重要动力。不朽者监督和指导种子的形成，而卢米则照看余烬并为新位面的（%0%）居民做准备。伊里安的不朽者很少干涉其他位面，因为他们已经在做的事情是他们可以执行的最重要的任务。",
	"Most inhabitants of Irian fall into one of the following categories.": "伊里安的大多数居民属于以下几类。",
	"Irian is bursting with life. Songbirds, rabbits, and other creatures roam the Garden. The streets of the Amaranthine City are filled with happy people. But the Garden never has too many rabbits, and there's no risk of the citizens of the Amaranthine City starving—or needing to go on strike to prevent it. Sometimes, if you glimpse one out of the corner of your eye, you might see them differently, as an outline of pale white light—a glowing shadow.": "伊里安的生命力迸发。鸣鸟、兔子和其他生物在花园里游荡。阿马兰斯城的街道上到处是快乐的人们。但花园里的兔子永远不会太多，也没有阿玛兰辛城的市民挨饿的风险，或者需要罢工来防止。有时，如果你从眼角瞥见一只，你可能会看到它们的不同，是淡淡的白光的轮廓--发光的影子。",
	"These are manifestations, not living creatures. Called embers, each one is linked to a spark—a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature. Through this connection, mortals draw inspiration and hope, and remain linked to the positive energy that flows to and from all living things. An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn't fully conscious and doesn't have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal's brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds. There are many more sparks in Irian than there are embers at any given moment; Irian simply dips into the pool of sparks, manifesting as many embers as the scene calls for, shaping the light of each soul into something that looks like them.": "这些是表现，而不是活的生物。称为余烬，每一个都与火花相连--一个灵魂的微小回声，每一个都与一个生物相联系。通过这种联系，凡人获得灵感和希望，并与流向和来自所有生物的积极能量保持联系。一个微光体类似于其火花的凡人，但它没有完全的意识，也没有任何完整的记忆，仅仅是那个凡人最明亮的欢乐、最深切的希望和最伟大的行为的回声。伊里安的火花比任何时候的余烬都要多；伊里安只是浸泡在火花池中，根据场景的需要显现出尽可能多的余烬，将每个灵魂的光芒塑造成像他们一样的东西。",
	"Embers don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. They follow basic scripts, but can't improvise and don't have much knowledge beyond what they need for their role. As a rule, embers are happy, for they don't know any other way to be. An ember can't be truly killed; its body dissolves, but the spark that fueled it remains safely within Irian's deep well of light.": "烬不需要吃、喝、呼吸或睡觉。他们遵循基本的脚本，但不能即兴发挥，除了他们的角色所需的知识外，没有太多的知识。通常情况下，微光体是快乐的，因为他们不知道有什么其他的方式。微光不能被真正杀死；它的身体会溶解，但激发它的火花仍然安全地留在伊里安的深层光井中。",
	"While adventuring in Irian, you might see an ember that resembles you—but it won't recognize you, and might not even appear the same age. This ember is merely your light-shadow, manifested by Irian and channeling your life force. It holds the essence of your best moments and emotions, the light within you that drives you to goodness—but merely as a spark, not the fire of a living creature.": "在伊里安冒险时，你可能会看到一个与你相似的微光，但它不会认出你，甚至可能看起来不是同龄人。这个微光只是你的光影，由伊里安显现出来，并引导着你的生命力。它拥有你最好的时刻和情感的精髓，是你内心驱使你向善的光，但只是作为一个火花，而不是一个生物的火焰。",
	"When a mortal dies and their soul goes to Dolurrh, the thread connecting them to Irian is severed. Any ember fueled by their spark dissolves and the spark—the essence of the hopes and brightest moments of the mortal's life—begins to fade. But the sparks of the dead can merge together before they're lost completely, creating a new, unique entity—a lumi, formed from the same positive energy as the embers, but possessing true consciousness and life. Unlike the embers, who aren't fully conscious or aware of the memories they hold, lumi are sentient creatures, each with a unique identity, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives. So adventurers may meet a lumi who recognizes them, and who has a few memories and traits of a fallen friend.": "当一个凡人死亡，他们的灵魂去了多鲁尔，连接他们和伊里安的线就被切断了。任何以他们的火花为燃料的微光都会消失，而火花--凡人生命中的希望和最光明时刻的精华--开始消逝。但死者的火花在完全消失之前可以融合在一起，创造一个新的、独特的实体--卢米，由与余烬相同的正能量形成，但拥有真正的意识和生命。与余烬不同的是，余烬没有完全的意识，也不知道他们所拥有的记忆，而卢米是有意识的生物，每个人都有一个独特的身份，尽管他们的火花给了他们许多凡人生活的片段。因此，冒险者可能会遇到一个认出他们的卢米人，他有一些记忆和死去的朋友的特征。",
	"Lumi appear to be formed from solidified light, and generally take a body shape similar to the strongest of the sparks that formed them—usually those of sentient creatures. Their most distinctive feature is their head—a sphere of light suspended a few inches above their torso. Normally this is pure light, but with conscious effort, a lumi can sculpt and maintain a face. Their statistics can be represented by the {@creature priest} in the {@book Monster Manual|mm} (or an exceptionally powerful one might use the statistics of the {@creature war priest} in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}), but they don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, they don't age, and they're immune to poison and disease. When a lumi reaches 0 hit points, its body dissolves and its sparks fade. If an angel of Irian is nearby, it can consume these sparks; this won't save the lumi, but at least those memories are preserved. While most lumi are humanoids, there may be lumi formed from the sparks of other creatures, like giants or dragons, that dwell in layers of their own kind.": "卢米似乎是由凝固的光形成的，一般来说，他们的身体形状类似于形成他们的最强的火花--通常是那些有生命的生物。他们最独特的特征是他们的头--一个悬浮在他们躯干上方几英寸的光球。通常这是纯粹的光，但在有意识的努力下，卢米可以雕刻并保持一个脸。他们的统计数据可以用{@book Monster Manual|mm}中的{@creature priest}来表示（或者一个特别强大的可能会用{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}中的{@creature war priest}的统计数据），但是他们不需要吃、喝、呼吸或睡觉，他们不会衰老，而且对毒药和疾病免疫。当卢米的命中率达到0时，它的身体会溶解，其火花也会消退。如果伊里安的天使在附近，它可以吞噬这些火花；这不会拯救卢米，但至少这些记忆被保留下来。虽然大多数卢米人是人类，但也可能有卢米人是由其他生物的火花形成的，比如巨人或龙，他们居住在自己的同类层中。",
	"Lumi serve as the caretakers of the embers, and believe that by helping the embers play their roles, they're strengthening the light in the mortals the embers are connected to. Lumi help develop and maintain the planar seeds, and some even surrender their identity in order to become new creatures within that seed; they believe that in doing this, they're sowing the new layer with light. On rare occasions, lumi travel to other planes in service of the Architects. They are brave and compassionate, seeking always to spread hope, and ever prepared to lay down their lives for the greater good. Lumi can defend themselves, but they prefer to inspire others when possible, rather than resort to violence.": "卢米是余烬的看护者，他们相信通过帮助余烬发挥他们的作用，他们正在加强余烬所连接的凡人的光。卢米帮助发展和维护星球的种子，有些人甚至交出自己的身份，以便成为该种子中的新生物；他们认为这样做是在为新层播撒光明。在极少数情况下，卢米会前往其他星球为建筑师服务。他们勇敢而富有同情心，总是寻求传播希望，并随时准备为更大的利益献出自己的生命。卢米可以保护自己，但他们宁愿在可能的情况下激励他人，而不是诉诸暴力。",
	"Irian's immortals are spirits of light and hope. Irian is noteworthy for being the home of the ki-rin. These majestic creatures often act as emissaries for the Architects. Each planar seed has a ki-rin assigned to monitor it, help the lumi, and ease transition.": "伊里安的不朽者是光明和希望的灵魂。伊里安值得一提的是，它是麒麟的故乡。这些雄伟的生物经常充当建筑师的使者。每个星球的种子都有一个麒麟被指派来监视它，帮助卢米，并缓解过渡。",
	"Irian is also home to angels. Not as violent as the angels of Shavarath or as individualistic as the angels of Syrania, the angels of Irian embody the general principles of hope and compassion. Irian devas assist the lumi and help sustain the different layers; they are the knights and scholars of the Amaranthine City. Devas often change their form to play multiple roles within a layer, and adventurers may think that they've encountered multiple people, when in fact it's a single deva. Meanwhile, planetars act as champions and ministers, and each of the Architects has a single solar that serves as its right hand.": "伊里安也是天使的家园。伊里安的天使不像沙瓦拉特的天使那样暴力，也不像锡拉尼亚的天使那样有个性，他们体现了希望和慈悲的一般原则。伊里安的魔鬼协助卢米，并帮助维持不同的层次；他们是阿玛兰斯城的骑士和学者。魔法师经常改变他们的形式，在一个层中扮演多种角色，冒险者可能会认为他们遇到了多个人，而实际上是一个魔法师。同时，行星人充当冠军和部长，每个建筑师都有一个作为其右手的单一太阳。",
	"The angels of Irian have wings formed of light, which they can conceal if they wish. In their true form, they're luminescent humanoids of indeterminate species, but can choose to appear to mortals as a generic member of the viewer's species. Devas also possesses the ability to change into specific forms at will.": "伊里安的天使有一双由光形成的翅膀，如果他们愿意，可以将其隐藏起来。在他们的真实形态中，他们是发光的人形生物，物种不确定，但可以选择以观看者的物种的一般成员出现在凡人面前。魔鬼还拥有随心所欲地改变成特定形式的能力。",
	"The Architects are the most powerful spirits of Irian. Each embodies an aspect of the plane, and oversees a region within it, as discussed in the \"Layers\" section. They're unique celestials with great wisdom and power, but most of their time and energy is devoted to the planar seeds—guiding the growth of the seed, smoothing over problems, and adding a few personal touches. Planar seeds emerge within an Architect's realm, expanding until they break off and join their new planes.": "建筑师是伊里安最强大的神灵。每个人都体现了平面的一个方面，并监督其中的一个区域，正如在 \"层次 \"部分所讨论的。他们是独特的天人，拥有巨大的智慧和力量，但他们的大部分时间和精力都用在了星球的种子上，指导种子的成长，抚平问题，并加入一些个人修饰。平面种子在建筑师的领域内出现，不断扩大，直到它们脱离并加入它们的新平面。",
	"The power of the Architects is largely bound to their realms. They can't directly intervene in the Material Plane, though they can work with warlocks (as Celestial patrons) or send lumi. Often this involves the reintegration of a planar seed, or examining regions where Mabar has removed a fragment.": "架构师的力量在很大程度上受限于他们的领域。他们不能直接干预物质世界，尽管他们可以与术士合作（作为天体赞助人）或发送鲁米。通常这涉及到一个平面种子的重新整合，或者检查马巴尔移除碎片的区域。",
	"It's always morning in Irian; the skies are clear, the sun is fixed in the sky, and the moon Barrakas is faintly visible. The plane contains many layers, and it's always growing new ones. While the setting of a layer varies—a verdant valley, a growing city, a newly established farm—the story is always about life, growth, and hope. Things are growing, people are prosperous, and the future is bright. While there are many natural environments in Irian, it's this optimism that differentiates them from those of Lamannia. Irian is a celebration of life; Lamannia focuses on the untamable primordial power of nature, and often feels more threatening and wild.": "在伊里安总是早晨；天空晴朗，太阳固定在空中，月亮巴拉卡斯隐约可见。这个平面包含许多层，而且一直在增长新的层。虽然每一层的背景各不相同--青翠的山谷、成长中的城市、新建立的农场，但故事总是关于生命、成长和希望。事物在成长，人们在繁荣，未来是光明的。虽然伊里安有许多自然环境，但正是这种乐观主义使它们与拉曼尼亚的环境不同。伊里安是对生命的赞美；拉曼尼亚则专注于自然界不可驯服的原始力量，往往给人以更大的威胁和野性。",
	"The layers are linked in realms, each of which is bound to one of the Architects. The denizens and themes of a layer reflect the influence of that Architect, so all of the layers of the Garden have a focus on rustic nature, while those tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its rising imperial power. Some layers are bounded by physical barriers, but most either loop back on themselves or end in walls of warm mist—anyone who wanders into the fog reemerges elsewhere in the layer. Within realms, layers are often connected by physical portals like a massive gate or a pool of light. Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you're in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.": "各层之间以境界相连，每个境界都与建筑师之一有联系。一个层的居民和主题反映了该建筑师的影响，所以花园的所有层都以质朴的自然为重点，而与亚马逊城有关的层则反映了其不断上升的帝国力量。有些层以物理障碍物为界，但大多数层要么回环往复，要么以温暖的雾墙为终点--任何误入雾中的人都会在该层的其他地方出现。在境界内，各层通常由物理门户连接，如一个巨大的门或一个光池。在不同境界之间移动需要平面转换或与该境界相关的仪式。这些仪式可能并不神奇；它们只是必须要学习的秘密。如果你在亚马逊城，你想去花园旅行，你所要做的就是种下一朵花，并思考它的美丽；这些想法会带你到那里。",
	"Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they're small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they're to become. Thus, you could stumble into a layer that replicates a piece of Dolurrh's Catacombs or represents conflict in Shavarath. However, these layers aren't fully developed—once they are, they move onto their destination plane—so Irian's seed of the Catacombs of Dolurrh won't have the entrapping effect of Dolurrh itself.": "平面的种子从境界中萌发出来。在早期，它们是一些主题不明确的小层，但会逐渐扩大，并逐渐具有它们将要成为的平面的性质和属性。因此，你可能会偶然发现一个复制了多鲁尔墓穴（Dolurrh's Catacombs）或代表沙瓦拉斯（Shavarath）冲突的层。然而，这些层并没有完全发展起来--一旦发展起来，它们就会转移到它们的目的地平面--所以伊里安的多鲁尔地下墓穴的种子不会有多鲁尔本身的禁锢效果。",
	"Here are three examples of realms, but there are many more.": "这里有三个境界的例子，但还有很多。",
	"This immense metropolis fills an entire layer. The Amaranthine City is the capital of an empire in its first bloom of glory. Gilded banners catch the wind. Armored angels and pegasi patrols pass overhead. People laugh in the streets, healthy and happy. Artisans create a mosaic depicting glorious victories. While this is an empire, the message isn't about oppression, but one of {@i potential}. This is an empire where all the citizens are prosperous and all have equal opportunities. People are proud, the city is full of wonders, and the future is bright.": "这个巨大的大都市充满了整个楼层。阿马兰斯城是一个帝国的首都，正处于其最初的辉煌时期。镀金的旗帜迎风飘扬。装甲的天使和佩加西的巡逻队从头顶掠过。人们在街上欢笑，健康而快乐。工匠们创作了一幅幅马赛克，描绘了光荣的胜利。虽然这是一个帝国，但信息不是关于压迫，而是关于（%0%）的。这是一个所有公民都繁荣的帝国，所有人都有平等的机会。人们很自豪，城市充满了奇迹，未来一片光明。",
	"The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Irian. Its Dawn Empress is the first and greatest of the Architects. Her defining principle is growth, the opportunity to reach your full potential, and all layers of her realm reflect this. Her empire isn't driven by conquest, but rather by exploration—discovering new lands and opportunities, just as mortals can always find new talents within and opportunities beyond. The Dawn Empress is a celestial figure wreathed in light, though she can assume the shape of any humanoid or angel. She presides over festivals and tends the needs of her people, but she spends much of her time focused on the cultivation of her planar seeds. She occasionally works with mortals, typically warlocks; while she may have missions tied to planar seeds or to clashing with agents of Mabar, she also gives her agents tasks that are designed to help them with their own growth and evolution.": "阿马兰斯城被广泛认为是伊里安的心脏。它的黎明皇后是建筑师中第一个也是最伟大的一个。她的决定性原则是成长，是发挥你全部潜力的机会，她的领域的所有层面都反映了这一点。她的帝国不是由征服驱动的，而是由探索驱动的--发现新的土地和机会，就像凡人总是能在内部找到新的才能和超越的机会。黎明女皇是一个被光环笼罩的天体，尽管她可以变成任何类人或天使的形状。她主持节日，照顾她的人民的需要，但她把大部分时间都花在她的星球种子的培育上。她偶尔会与凡人合作，通常是术士；虽然她的任务可能与平面种子或与马巴尔的代理人发生冲突有关，但她也给她的代理人布置任务，旨在帮助他们自己的成长和进化。",
	"Layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of expansion and discovery. These layers may hold outposts in otherwise-uninhabited lands filled with wonders of nature, or they might hold prosperous farms and estates, inhabited by embers, with lumi and devas helping to drive the theme.": "与亚马逊之城相关的层反映了其扩张和发现的主题。这些层级可能是在其他无人居住的土地上的前哨站，充满了自然界的奇迹，也可能是繁荣的农场和庄园，由余烬居住，由卢米和魔鬼帮助推动这一主题。",
	"The Garden lives up to its name; it's a vast zoological garden filled with foliage. It contains every plant that can be found in the Material Plane, along with many that can't. There are winding paths, peaceful pools, wondrous topiaries, and complicated hedge mazes. In contrast to the wilds of Lamannia, this is very carefully cultivated. The Garden is suffused with a sense of peace, beauty, and the wondrous things life can create.": "花园名副其实；它是一个巨大的动物学花园，到处都是树叶。它包含了每一种在物质界可以找到的植物，以及许多不能找到的植物。这里有蜿蜒的小路，宁静的池塘，奇妙的拓荒植物，以及复杂的树篱迷宫。与拉曼尼亚的荒野相比，这里是非常精心栽培的。花园里充满了和平、美丽和生命所能创造的奇妙事物的感觉。",
	"The Garden is the realm of the Gardener, an Architect whose principle is life. He's a blend of angel and plant—more humanoid than treant, but with skin of bark, a beard of leaves, and a crown of flowers. Like all of the Architects, he's devoted to his planar seeds, but he also spends time wandering the garden, both tending it and appreciating its wonders. He apprecates those who nurture and heal others, and this is the behavior he expects of any mortals he associates with.": "花园是园丁的领域，是一个以生命为原则的建筑师。他是天使和植物的混合体--与其说是树人，不如说是人形，但有树皮的皮肤，树叶的胡须和花冠。像所有的建筑师一样，他致力于他的星球种子，但他也花时间在花园里徘徊，既照顾它又欣赏它的奇迹。他赞赏那些培育和治疗他人的人，这也是他对任何与他交往的凡人的期望行为。",
	"The many layers of the Garden realm showcase various elements of fertility and the triumph of life. There are a few layers that are slightly darker than the rest of Irian, though still suffused with dim light in their darkest corners—these reflect the principle that life overcomes hardship. The message of the ruined castle isn't to dwell on the destruction, but to see the flowers blooming on the walls. Most of the embers in the region take animal form, and {@creature ki-rin|VGM} are the most comon celestials.": "花园境界的许多层展示了各种生育和生命胜利的元素。有几层比伊里安的其他地方略微暗一些，尽管在其最黑暗的角落里仍然充斥着昏暗的光线--这些反映了生命战胜困难的原则。破败的城堡所传达的信息不是沉浸在破坏中，而是看到墙壁上绽放的花朵。该地区的大部分余烬都是动物形态，（%0%）是最常见的天体。",
	"The Refuge is a vast fortress-monastery, though it has aspects of a spa as well. It's filled with tranquil groves, soothing baths, and places to rest and reflect. The fortress walls don't represent potential conflict, but rather speak to the absolute security of the place—within its walls, you are safe from all threats. The Refuge holds healers who can treat your injuries, mediators who can talk through problems, and sages who may not know the answers you need, but can point you in the right direction. This isn't a place where adventures occur; it's where you recover from your injuries and plan your next move, knowing that you're safe and that there are answers to every problem.": "庇护所是一个巨大的堡垒-修道院，尽管它也有温泉的一面。它充满了宁静的小树林，舒缓的浴池，以及可以休息和思考的地方。堡垒墙并不代表潜在的冲突，而是说明这个地方的绝对安全--在墙内，你是安全的，不受任何威胁。避难所里有可以治疗你的伤势的医生，有可以讨论问题的调解人，还有可能不知道你需要的答案，但可以为你指出正确方向的贤人。这不是一个发生冒险的地方；它是你从伤害中恢复并计划下一步行动的地方，因为你知道你是安全的，而且每个问题都有答案。",
	"Araam is the Architect of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope. She's a wise advisor, and while she may not always have answers, she helps people look at their problems in new ways and see that all problems can be solved. She's the finest healer in Irian, and there are few injuries she cannot heal or curses she cannot break. There's no monetary cost for the services of the Refuge, but Araam charges thoes who benefit to give hope to someone who needs it; they won't be allowed to return to the Refuge until that debt is paid. While Araam isn't a god, a {@class cleric||Life cleric|life} could say that their class features come from training in the Refute and are tied to the power of Irian.": "阿拉姆是避难所的建筑师，体现了希望的概念。她是一个明智的顾问，虽然她不一定有答案，但她帮助人们以新的方式看待他们的问题，并看到所有问题都可以解决。她是伊里安最好的治疗师，很少有她不能治愈的伤痛或不能打破的诅咒。庇护所的服务没有货币成本，但阿拉姆向那些受益者收取费用，让他们给需要的人带来希望；在债务得到偿还之前，他们不会被允许回到庇护所。虽然阿拉姆不是神，但（%0%）可以说他们的阶级特征来自于驳斥的训练，并与伊里安的力量相联系。",
	"While not all layers of Araam's realm provide the security and succor of the Refuge itself, they all can provide comfort and hope. They don't have the absolute peace of Syrania, but they make people {@i feel} there's hope. Irian has no match for the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, so if you're looking for commerce, the Azure Sky has more options. But for adventurers who seek a relaxing vacation in the planes, the Refuge is unparalleled.": "虽然不是所有的阿拉姆境界都能提供庇护所本身的安全和救助，但它们都能提供安慰和希望。他们没有锡拉尼亚的绝对和平，但他们让人们{@i feel}有了希望。伊里安没有比得上锡拉尼亚的无量市场，所以如果你要寻找商业，蔚蓝天空有更多的选择。但对于在飞机上寻求轻松度假的冒险者来说，避难所是无与伦比的。",
	"Here are a few of the ways Irian can affect the Material Plane.": "以下是伊里安影响物质世界的几种方式。",
	"Manifest zones tied to Irian are wellsprings of positive energy. Plants and animals thrive in these zones, while people are less likely to dwell on negative emotions and find it easier to embrace hope and joy. Irian zones often have one or more of the plane's universal properties. Irian zones with the Radiant Power property support spells of healing and may enable rituals or support eldritch machines that can't be built anywhere else. In particular, the City of the Dead in Aerenal is built on a strong Irian manifest zone, which sustains the deathless councilors.": "与伊里安联系在一起的显化区是正能量的源泉。植物和动物在这些区域茁壮成长，而人们不太可能沉浸在负面情绪中，而是更容易接受希望和欢乐。伊里安区通常有一个或多个平面的普遍属性。具有辐射力属性的伊里安区支持治疗法术，并可能实现仪式或支持其他地方无法建造的长生机。特别是，艾瑞纳的亡灵之城建立在一个强大的伊里安显化区上，它支撑着无死亡的议员们。",
	"Irian zones rarely extend the full swift healing effect of Irian's Light of Life property. However, all of the following benefits are common when in an Irian zone:": "伊里安区很少能延长伊里安的生命之光属性的全部快速治疗效果。然而，在伊里安区域时，以下所有的好处都是常见的。",
	"You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks.": "你在智慧（医学）检查上有优势。",
	"Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points, use the highest number possible for each die.": "每当你花费命中率骰子来恢复命中率时，要尽可能使用每个骰子的最高数字。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.": "你对疾病、毒药和恐惧的救赎有优势。",
	"For all these reasons, Irian manifest zones are a valuable natural resource, and often become the foundations of villages, towns, or Jorasco healing houses. Irian manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, and traveling to Irian usually requires {@spell plane shift} or similar magic.": "由于所有这些原因，伊里安显现区是一种宝贵的自然资源，并经常成为村庄、城镇或乔拉斯科治疗所的基础。伊里安显化区很少作为通往平面的门户，前往伊里安通常需要（%0%）或类似的魔法。",
	"Life blossoms when Irian is coterminous. Health and fertility are enhanced, positive energy flows freely, and living creatures are infused with an abundant sense of hope. While Irian is coterminous, the Radiant Power property applies across Eberron and all creatures have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.": "当伊里安是同源的时候，生命就会开花结果。健康和生育能力得到增强，正能量自由流动，生物被注入了丰富的希望。当伊里安是同源的时候，辐射力量的属性适用于整个艾伯伦，所有的生物在面对疾病、毒药和恐惧时都有优势。",
	"When Irian is remote, colors seem to fade and a sense of psychic numbness pervades the world. All creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against fear and resistance to radiant damage. In addition, any effect that restores hit points—including spells and spending Hit Dice—only restores half the usual amount. However, creatures still regain full hit points after completing a long rest.": "当伊里安处于偏远地区时，颜色似乎会变淡，一种精神上的麻木感充斥着世界。所有的生物在对抗恐惧和抵抗辐射伤害时都有劣势。此外，任何恢复命中率的效果--包括法术和花费命中率--只能恢复通常量的一半。然而，生物在完成长期休息后仍能恢复全部命中率。",
	"Traditionally, Irian is coterminous for ten days in the month of Eyre and remote for ten days in the month of Sypheros. These effects occur once every three years; the remote cycle comes a year and a half after it is coterminous.": "传统上，伊里安在艾尔月有十天的同位，在西弗罗月有十天的遥位。这些影响每三年发生一次；远程周期是在同期之后的一年半。",
	"The Aereni harness Irian's energy, using it to create many of their tools, but industry isn't one of the core concepts of Irian and relics from the plane itself are relatively rare. Whether from the plane itself or simply drawing on its power, items tie to the effects of positive energy: healing, dealing radiant damage, generating light, bringing hope, or overcoming fear. A scroll that provides a single trip to the Refuge would be an invaluable boon.": "艾瑞尼人利用伊里安的能量，用它来制造许多工具，但工业并不是伊里安的核心概念之一，来自飞机本身的遗物也相对罕见。无论是来自飞机本身还是简单地利用它的力量，物品都与正能量的效果有关：治疗、造成辐射伤害、产生光亮、带来希望或克服恐惧。一张能提供一次前往避难所的卷轴将是一个无价之宝。",
	"Plants that grow in Irian manifest zones can often have remarkable properties. Many of of Aerenal's exotic lumbers—notably livewood—only grow in Irian zones. Araam's crown is a flower with remarkable medicinal properties; House Jorasco requires a steady supply of it for their healing potions. Another flower, dawn's glory, has euphoric properties and is used to make a drug often called fool's hope or liquid courage. This drug grants temporary immunity to fear, but with the side effect of encouraging dangerous and foolhardy behavior; it's strictly illegal in Sharn, due to the risk of users jumping off bridges.": "生长在伊里安显露区的植物往往能有非凡的特性。艾瑞纳的许多异国木材，特别是活木，只生长在伊里安地区。Araam's crown是一种具有显著药用价值的花；Jorasco家族的治疗药水需要稳定的供应。另一种花，黎明的荣耀，具有兴奋的特性，被用来制作一种药物，通常称为傻瓜的希望或液体勇气。这种药物赋予人们对恐惧的暂时免疫力，但它的副作用是鼓励危险和愚蠢的行为；由于使用者有跳桥的危险，它在沙恩是严格违法的。",
	"At first glance, Irian can seem much too good to be true. Its inhabitants are benevolent, and it heals you every round. What's the catch?": "乍一看，伊里安似乎好得不像真的。它的居民是仁慈的，而且每轮都会为你提供治疗。有什么问题吗？",
	"At the most basic level, there isn't a catch. It's the literal embodiment of light triumphing over darkness and the power of hope. While certain diseases could be seen as tied to the concept of growth, Irian doesn't have a dark side in the same way as, for example, Daanvi. However, there are a few obvious limitations. It's not an easy plane to reach, as its manifest zones don't act as portals. So the Refuge is a perfect shelter for anyone who can reach it, but you have to find a way to get there. And with the Refuge in particular, you get one free visit, but after that, Araam expects you to help someone else before she'll welcome you again.": "在最基本的层面上，并没有什么陷阱。它是光明战胜黑暗和希望的力量的字面体现。虽然某些疾病可以被视为与成长的概念相联系，但伊里安并不像达安维等人那样有黑暗的一面。然而，也有一些明显的限制。它不是一个容易到达的平面，因为它的显露区不能作为门户。因此，避难所对任何能到达它的人来说都是一个完美的庇护所，但你必须找到一种方法去那里。尤其是避难所，你可以免费参观一次，但在那之后，阿拉姆希望你能帮助其他人，然后她才会再次欢迎你。",
	"There are a few ideas you can explore. The first is that unfounded hope can be dangerous. A lumi or deva might spread hope because that's its nature—but in doing so, may convince people they have a chance to defeat an enemy that they should actually be fleeing from. You can also explore mortal forces abusing the power of Irian—Jorasco seizing a manifest zone to grow Araam's crown or criminals trafficking in fool's hope.": "有几个想法你可以探讨。第一个想法是，毫无根据的希望可能是危险的。一个卢米人或魔鬼可能会传播希望，因为这是它的本性，但在这样做的时候，可能会让人们相信他们有机会击败敌人，而实际上他们应该逃离。你也可以探索凡人的力量滥用伊里安的力量--乔拉斯科夺取了一个明显的区域来发展阿拉姆的王冠，或者犯罪分子贩卖愚人的希望。",
	"Perhaps a villain wields a Mabaran scythe that deals wounds that can't be healed by magic or rest, or a hag lays a terrible curse on an adventurer. It's said that all wounds and woes can be cured in the Refuge of Irian. But how will the adventurers reach the Eternal Dawn, and what will Araam ask of them in return?": "也许一个恶棍挥舞着马巴兰镰刀，造成魔法或休息无法治愈的伤口，或者一个巫婆对一个冒险者下了可怕的诅咒。据说，所有的伤口和痛苦都可以在伊里安的避难所中得到治愈。但是，冒险家们将如何到达永恒的黎明，阿拉姆又会向他们索取什么作为回报呢？",
	"When the adventurers cross paths with a lumi, it hails them. It holds the memory of a hero who once saved the life of one of the characters, and that debt was never repaid; the lumi asks them to honor that by helping with its current quest. This could be a debt incurred during the party's travels, or even something from a character's backstory; you could ask a player to tell you about a time someone saved their character's life, and let them add depth to the debt.": "当冒险者与卢米交汇时，它向他们发出了呼唤。它记忆中的英雄曾经救过其中一个角色的命，而那笔债从来没有偿还过；鲁米要求他们通过帮助它完成当前的任务来纪念这一点。这可以是党的旅行中产生的债务，甚至可以是角色背景故事中的东西；你可以让玩家告诉你某个人曾经救过他们的角色，并让他们为这笔债务增加深度。",
	"A barren region on the border of two nations or rival clans suddenly becomes a wondrous, fertile oasis. This is the result of a planar seed taking root. In addition to whatever remarkable plants or resources it holds, it's become an Irian manifest zone—a valuable resource. Dispute over the territory could have disastrous consequences; can the adventurers prevent bloodshed? And has the Architect hidden any secrets or artifacts in this seed land?": "两个国家或敌对部族边界上的一个贫瘠地区突然变成了一个奇妙的、肥沃的绿洲。这是一颗星球种子扎根的结果。除了拥有任何非凡的植物或资源外，它还成为了伊里安的表现区--一种宝贵的资源。对这块领土的争议可能会带来灾难性的后果；冒险家们能阻止流血事件吗？建筑师是否在这片种子地里藏有任何秘密或神器？",
	"It's hard to keep a consistent rhythm in Kythri. It takes effort to maintain any pattern of behavior; without even thinking about it, people in Kythri adjust their behavior to avoid repetition. This is the essence of Kythri. On the one hand it's a vision of chaos, but it's also about change, adapting to overcome the unexpected, and challenging traditions.": "在Kythri，要保持一致的节奏是很难的。保持任何行为模式都需要努力；在Kythri，人们甚至不假思索地调整自己的行为以避免重复。这就是Kythri的本质。一方面，它是一个混乱的愿景，但它也是关于变化、适应以克服意外，以及挑战传统的。",
	"Kythri is commonly imagined as utterly unstable, with landscapes taking shape only to boil away within moments. And this is true of the heart of the realm, known as the Sea of Chaos. But at the edges of the sea, there are islands that linger. The environments of these Shifting Islands steadily and constantly change; a vast desert might be a lush rainforest in a few hours. But the land itself remains constant, and creatures can live on these islands, adapting to the endlessly changing environment.": "Kythri通常被认为是完全不稳定的，地貌的形成在瞬间就会沸腾消失。这个王国的中心地带也是如此，被称为混乱之海。但在海的边缘，有一些岛屿在徘徊。这些移位岛的环境稳定且不断变化；一个巨大的沙漠可能在几个小时内就变成了茂盛的雨林。但土地本身保持不变，生物可以生活在这些岛屿上，适应无尽变化的环境。",
	"While Kythri constantly changes, its elements are usually natural. A jungle becomes a desert, a blizzard becomes a sandstorm—but it's comprised of sand, not tiny marble busts of King Boranel. This distinguishes Kythri from Xoriat or Dal Quor; while constantly changing, it's generally change between plausible options, unlike the unreal environments of the Realm of Madness and the Region of Dreams.": "虽然Kythri不断变化，但其元素通常是自然的。丛林变成了沙漠，暴风雪变成了沙尘暴--但它是由沙子组成的，而不是博拉内尔国王的微小大理石半身像。这将Kythri与Xoriat或Dal Quor区分开来；虽然不断变化，但它通常是在合理的选项之间变化，而不像疯狂之境和梦幻之域的虚幻环境。",
	"All things change in Kythri, even time and the future. The only thing that's truly reliable is that nothing's reliable.": "在Kythri，所有东西都在变化，甚至是时间和未来。唯一真正可靠的事情是，没有什么是可靠的。",
	"A creature can't take the exact same action on two consecutive turns. If it previously stood still, it must move. If it previously moved, it can stand still or move a different distance. A creature can cast a spell in two consecutive turns, but it can't be the same spell. A creature can attack on two consecutive turns, but the second attack must be described as substantially different in style from the one before.": "一个生物不能在连续两个回合中采取完全相同的行动。如果它之前站着不动，它必须移动。如果它之前移动过，它可以站着不动或移动不同的距离。一个生物可以在两个连续的回合中施放一个法术，但不能是同一个法术。一个生物可以在连续的两个回合中进行攻击，但第二次攻击必须被描述为与之前的攻击在风格上有很大不同。",
	"When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if it has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is doubled.": "当一个生物施展转化法术时，其范围增加一倍；如果它的持续时间至少为1分钟但少于24小时，则持续时间增加一倍。",
	"In order to cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 12 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. Divination spells cast on other planes can't affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.": "为了施展一级或更高等级的占卜法术，一个生物必须成功地进行施法能力检查，检查的DC等于12+该法术的等级。如果检定失败，该法术就不会被施放，其法术槽也不会被消耗，但该行动就会丧失。在其他位面施展的占卜法术不能影响或针对Kythri的生物、地方或物体。",
	"If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1 or a 2, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 19 or 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC, and is considered a critical hit. If a creature has an ability or item that increases its normal range of critical hits—such as the Champion fighter's Improved Critical—its range increases by 1.": "如果攻击的d20卷是1或2，则攻击不中，不考虑任何修饰因素或目标的AC。如果攻击的D20卷是19或20，那么无论任何修饰物或目标的AC，攻击都会命中，并被认为是关键一击。如果一个生物有一种能力或物品可以增加其正常的关键打击范围--比如冠军战士的改良关键--其范围增加1。",
	"Nothing remains exactly the same in Kythri. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe what's changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish Aundairian design when it was originally Karrnathi. You could choose for the change to be physical—your skin, hairstyle, or sex—or mental—you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the Sovereign Host. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins won't turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impact—for example, if your cleric's faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect that—discuss the possibility with your DM.": "在Kythri没有什么是完全不变的。每当一个生物完成了短期或长期的休息，它就会发现自己或自己的物品发生了一些变化。每个玩家都应该描述他们角色的变化；这可以很简单，比如你的斗篷变了颜色，或者你的剑现在有了时尚的Aundairian设计，而它原本是Karrnathi的。你可以选择身体上的变化--你的皮肤、发型或性别，或者精神上的变化--你突然讨厌橄榄，或者不再相信主宰者。这些变化没有机械影响：你口袋里的硬币可能会改变设计，但铜币不会变成白金。如果你想让一个变化产生机械影响--例如，如果你的牧师的信仰或种族发生了变化，你想让你的角色表反映出来--请与你的管理员讨论这个可能性。",
	"Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.": "时间在Kythri是流动的，与物质世界和它自己的岛屿都不一致。在Kythri呆了一天的冒险者可能会发现在Eberron已经过了一年，或者他们可能在Kythri被困了一年，当他们回来时发现只过了一个小时。",
	"Most of Kythri's denizens fall into one of three categories.": "大多数Kythri的居民属于三类之一。",
	"The islands of Kythri are inhabited. But how can a creature survive in an environment that can be a desert today and a glacier tomorrow? The answer, of course, is that the creature must change with the environment. Kythri's islands include some creatures that appear to be natural beasts, though they change as the region around them does; the wolf in the forest becomes an arctic wolf when the land turns into a glacier, and turns into a jackal when it's a desert. Even beyond their practical changes for survival, Kythrian creatures might be constantly shifting their plumage, behavior, and more fundamental biology, whether from moment to moment or day to day.": "Kythri的岛屿上有人居住。但是，一个生物如何能在今天是沙漠，明天是冰川的环境中生存？答案当然是，生物必须随着环境的变化而变化。Kythri的岛屿上有一些生物似乎是天然的野兽，尽管它们会随着周围地区的变化而变化；当土地变成冰川时，森林里的狼会变成北极狼，而当土地变成沙漠时，又会变成豺狼。即使是在为生存而进行的实际变化之外，基斯里安生物也可能不断地改变它们的羽翼、行为和更基本的生物学特性，无论是从一刻到一刻还是从一天到一天。",
	"However, not all of Kythri's wild things transform into familiar forms. Part of the plane's core concept is evolving in response to change, and Kythri is home to many creatures that blend the features of two or more natural beasts: monstrosities such as the owlbear, griffon, and chimera. It's commonly accepted that at least some of these monstrosities first appeared in Kythri, and that they first appeared in Eberron either by passing through portals or due to the influence of manifest zones.": "然而，并不是所有Kythri的野生动物都会变成熟悉的形态。这个星球的核心概念之一就是随着变化而进化，Kythri有许多融合了两种或更多天然野兽特征的生物：如猫头鹰熊、狮鹫和奇美拉等怪兽。人们普遍认为，这些怪兽中至少有一部分最早出现在Kythri，而它们第一次出现在Eberron是通过传送门或由于显化区的影响。",
	"Just as the environments of Kythri are chaotic but largely blend natural elements, Kythrian monstrosities typically blend the forms of natural creatures. While there are hippogriffs and griffons in Kythri, inherently alien creatures like kruthiks and gricks aren't found here. The wild things of Kythri also include natural shapechangers, notably a wide variety of mimics—even colossal ones that can assume the shape of natural features such as hills or mountains. It's quite likely the mimics of Eberron either immigrated from Kythri or were created by its influence, much like the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion use the blood of the kar'lassa bound to Kythri to create their plasmids.": "正如Kythri的环境是混乱的，但在很大程度上融合了自然元素，Kythrian的怪兽通常融合了自然生物的形式。虽然Kythri有河马和狮鹫，但这里并没有发现像kruthiks和gricks这样固有的外来生物。Kythri的野生动物还包括自然变型者，特别是各种各样的模仿者--甚至是能够承担自然特征（如山丘或山脉）形状的巨大模仿者。很可能Eberron的模仿者要么是从Kythri移民过来的，要么是受其影响而产生的，就像永恒领地的sahuagin使用绑定在Kythri的kar'lassa的血液来创造他们的质粒。",
	"Unlike other planes where these wild things would likely be manifestations, the wild things of Kythri are mortal creatures. They live, reproduce, and die following (mostly) natural means, and have to find sustenance and shelter in their islands. Between the strange flow of time and unusual environments, this can lead to dramatic surges in populations or sudden extinctions. However, the plane itself seeds new life into islands that somehow become depopulated, and if all the griffons in Kythri were to die, new ones would eventually evolve. So even though Kythri doesn't have manifestations, it ensures a steady stream of mortals exist—and when they die, it replaces them.": "与其他星球不同的是，Kythri的野生动物很可能是显灵的，而Kythri的野生动物是凡人的生物。它们的生活、繁殖和死亡都遵循（大部分）自然的方式，并且必须在它们的岛屿上找到养料和庇护所。在奇怪的时间流和不寻常的环境之间，这可能导致人口的急剧增加或突然灭绝。然而，飞机本身将新的生命播撒到那些以某种方式变得荒芜的岛屿上，如果Kythri的所有狮鹫都死了，新的狮鹫最终会进化出来。因此，即使Kythri没有表现形式，它也能确保有源源不断的凡人存在--当他们死亡时，它会取代他们。",
	"The slaadi are native immortals of Kythri. Though they do reproduce (in strange and disturbing ways) and can die of mortal ailments, they're defined as immortals because their population remains constant. Whenever a new slaad is born—whatever the method of its creation—an existing slaad dies, seemingly at random. And whenever a slaad is killed, a new one is formed. So while they seem to share many of the traits of mortals, they can never be wiped out even if they die en masse, and even if a blue slaad transforms a village of humans into slaadi with the chaos phage, the overall number of slaadi doesn't increase.": "slaadi是Kythri的本土不朽者。虽然他们确实在繁殖（以奇怪和令人不安的方式），并可能死于凡人的疾病，但他们被定义为不死之身，因为他们的人口保持不变。每当一个新的Slaad诞生--无论其创造方法如何--现有的Slaad都会死亡，似乎是随机的。而每当一个slaad被杀，就会有一个新的slaad形成。因此，虽然他们似乎与凡人有许多共同的特征，但即使他们大量死亡，也不会被消灭，即使一个蓝色的slaad用混沌噬菌体将一个村庄的人类变成slaadi，slaadi的总数量也不会增加。",
	"The slaadi are the only native civilization of Kythri. They aren't a monolithic society; some live in massive cities, while others are tiny rustic communities. Each slaad community has its own distinct culture and a grand name, and the {@table Slaad Cultures|ExploringEberron} table provides a few examples of these—but there are many more, and they're constantly changing. The grand city of Cornerstone may be the seat of the brutal Concordance of Iron today, and the Enlightened Lyceum League a month later. These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren't instant; there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and revolution in between a change. The scope of a community won't change—Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village—but the structures of the community shift. Under the Concordance of Iron, Cornerstone is filled with brutalist iron towers, while the Cornerstone of the Lyceum League is filled with slender glass spires.": "Slaadi是Kythri唯一的本土文明。他们并不是一个铁板一块的社会；有些人生活在巨大的城市里，而有些人则是小小的乡村社区。每个slaad社区都有自己独特的文化和宏伟的名字，{@table Slaad Cultures|ExploringEberron}表格中提供了一些例子--但还有很多，而且它们在不断变化。宏伟的基石城今天可能是残酷的铁之协约的所在地，而一个月后则是开明的荔枝园联盟。这些变化快得惊人，但也不是一蹴而就；通常在一次变化之间至少有几天的混乱过渡和革命。一个社区的范围不会改变--角石永远是一个大都市，而特恩永远是一个村庄--但社区的结构会转变。在 \"铁的协约 \"下，基石充满了粗暴的铁塔，而莱西姆联盟的基石则充满了细长的玻璃尖塔。",
	"The slaadi themselves retain their core forms while their buildings and government change. Red slaadi are always red toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are squat and heavy. Kythri's influence can also cause slaadi to change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating particular colors—a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos phage, creating red or green slaadi—but a green slaad could go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership frequently changes, because it's based on color, not personality.": "斯拉迪本身保留了它们的核心形态，而它们的建筑和政府则发生了变化。红色的斯拉迪总是红色的蛤蟆状生物，会植入卵子，但莱西姆斯拉迪可能是高大而纤细的，而协和斯拉迪则是蹲着的，很重。凯瑟里的影响也能使斯拉迪改变颜色。因此，slaadi遵循标准的方法来创造特定的颜色--蓝色的slaad用混沌噬菌体感染生物，创造出红色或绿色的slaadi--但一个绿色的slaad可能在某天晚上睡觉，醒来时变成了死亡的slaad，反之亦然。在像协和会这样的文化中，这意味着领导层经常变化，因为它是基于颜色而不是个性。",
	"Because slaad cultures change so rapidly, they rarely enact plans beyond their own communities, though cities occasionally clash. Some weeks they seek to exterminate the githzerai, and other weeks, to ally with them. You never know what you'll get.": "由于Slaad文化变化如此之快，他们很少制定超出自己社区的计划，尽管城市之间偶尔会发生冲突。有些星期，他们试图消灭吉斯泽拉人，而另一些星期则与他们结盟。你永远不知道你会得到什么。",
	"The {@race gith (githzerai)|MTF|githzerai} aren't natives of Kythri, and their presence is an act of defiance: through unparalleled mental discipline, they create bastions of order in the heart of chaos. If they seek order, why don't they dwell in Daanvi? It's not that they simply desire order, but to strengthen their will by imposing it on a reality that absolutely defies it. The struggle is the purpose. Beyond this, they're served by the fact that even great powers can't scry into Kythri. The \"Eberron and the Gith\" sidebar explains how the githzerai came to Kythri and what they seek to accomplish.": "{@race gith (githzerai)|MTF|githzerai}并不是Kythri的本地人，他们的存在是一种反抗行为：通过无与伦比的精神纪律，他们在混乱的中心创造了秩序的堡垒。如果他们寻求秩序，为什么他们不居住在达安维？这并不是说他们仅仅渴望秩序，而是要通过把秩序强加给一个绝对违背秩序的现实来加强他们的意志。斗争就是目的。除此以外，即使是强大的力量也无法探查到Kythri，这也是他们的服务。\"Eberron和吉斯人 \"的侧边栏解释了吉斯人是如何来到Kythri的，以及他们想要实现的目标。",
	"The githzerai don't dwell on the Shifting Islands of Kythri. Instead, they've created their own islands in the Sea of Chaos: vast monastery vessels the size of small towns, moving through the eddies of chaos and defying transformation. The githzerai devote themselves to meditation and self-improvement, with little interest in what transpires beyond their monasteries. They have no particular love of outsiders—they consider all creatures of Eberron to be warped shadows of their stolen reality—but neither are they inherently hostile. A persuasive group of adventurers could find brief shelter in a githzerai monastery, especially if they bring something interesting to trade or have compelling stories to share. However, should the outsiders offend the githzerai, they'll feel no remorse in eliminating them; there's nothing evil in shining light to dispel a shadow.": "githzerai并不居住在Kythri的移动岛屿上。相反，他们在混沌之海中创造了自己的岛屿：巨大的寺院船只有如小镇般大小，在混沌的漩涡中穿行，不畏变化。吉斯泽拉人专注于冥想和自我完善，对寺院之外的事情兴趣不大。他们并不特别喜欢外来者--他们认为Eberron的所有生物都是他们偷来的现实的扭曲的影子，但他们也不是天生的敌对者。一群有说服力的冒险家可以在吉斯泽拉修道院找到短暂的庇护所，特别是如果他们带来了有趣的交易或者有令人信服的故事可以分享。然而，如果外来者冒犯了吉斯泽拉人，他们会毫不留情地消灭他们；用光来驱散阴影并不邪恶。",
	"Long ago, a proud empire was crushed by the daelkyr. But this wasn't the Empire of Dhakaan, but a nation of gifted psychics who lived in towers of crysteel and sentira. Dyrrn the Corruptor transformed their champions into the first illithids, using them as living weapons to subjugate their own people. When defeat was inevitable, the great leader Gith led a planar exodus, fleeing into Kythri. The Churning Chaos hid the refugees from pursuit, and through absolute discipline, they imposed stability upon chaos.": "很久以前，一个骄傲的帝国被达尔凯尔粉碎了。但这并不是达卡安帝国，而是一个由天赋异禀的通灵者组成的国家，他们住在水晶和森特拉的塔楼里。腐蚀者Dyrrn把他们的冠军变成了第一批illithids，用他们作为活的武器来征服自己的人民。当失败不可避免时，伟大的领袖吉斯领导了一场星球大逃亡，逃到了凯瑟里。汹涌的混沌掩盖了难民的踪迹，通过绝对的纪律，他们将稳定强加给了混沌。",
	"Once the refugees regained their strength, a bitter divide split their people. Zerthimon the Wise maintained that the people of Gith should remain within Kythri. He believed mental discipline was the ultimate key to victory and that, in time, they could gain the power to reclaim their reality. But Gith was a warrior, and her followers yearned for battle. They wanted to build their strength and resources by raiding every layer of reality until they found a way to destroy Xoriat.": "一旦难民们恢复了力量，他们的人民就发生了激烈的分裂。智者泽尔西蒙坚持认为吉斯人应该留在基斯里。他相信精神纪律是胜利的最终关键，假以时日，他们可以获得夺回现实的力量。但吉斯是一个战士，她的追随者们渴望战斗。他们想通过袭击现实的每一层来建立自己的力量和资源，直到他们找到摧毁Xoriat的方法。",
	"This situation remains today. The githzerai dwell in their monastery vessels in Kythri, gaining strength through the endless imposition of order upon chaos. The githyanki dwell in vast fortress-ships the size of cities, anchored in the trackless wastes of the Astral Plane, but their raiders can attack any plane. They slaughter devils in Shavarath and pillage the grand galas of Fernia. At any time, a githyanki warship could attack a major city in Khorvaire; it's up to the DM if this has ever happened before, or if the githyanki have left Eberron alone. Alternately, a githyanki merchant could be a recurring NPC, showing up and offering items pillaged from across the planes. Where the githzerai are serene and disciplined, the githyanki are passionate and aggressive. All gith despise the daelkyr and slaughter illithids whenever they can, and they could be curious and unexpected allies against a cult of the Dragon Below.": "这种情况一直持续到今天。githzerai住在他们在Kythri的修道院船只里，通过无休止地将秩序强加于混乱之中而获得力量。githyanki居住在巨大的堡垒船中，其大小相当于城市，停泊在星界的无轨荒原上，但他们的突袭者可以攻击任何平面。他们在沙瓦拉斯（Shavarath）屠杀魔鬼，并掠夺费尔尼亚（Fernia）的盛大舞会。在任何时候，Githyanki战舰都可以攻击Khorvaire的一个主要城市；这取决于DM是否曾经发生过，或者Githyanki是否已经离开Eberron。另外，吉特扬基商人可以是一个经常出现的NPC，出现并提供从各个星球掠夺的物品。吉斯泽拉人是宁静而有纪律的，而吉特扬基人则是热情而有攻击性的。所有的吉斯人都鄙视戴尔克尔人，只要有机会就会屠杀伊利特人，他们可以成为好奇的、出乎意料的盟友，来对抗地下龙的邪教组织。",
	"Hearing this tale, one might well ask: where are the gith from? They're from Eberron—but not the Eberron that exists today. They came from a world surrounded by the Ring of Siberys, but there were no humans or elves on their Eberron. According to the githzerai, when the daelkyr completed their work on Eberron, they wiped the gith world from existence and created a new reality. If this is true, they may have done this countless times... and if they break the Gatekeeper seals, they could do it again. What the githzerai ultimately hope to achieve is to reassert their reality onto the Material Plane.": "听到这个故事，人们很可能会问：吉斯人来自哪里？他们来自Eberron，但不是今天的Eberron。他们来自一个被西伯利亚之环包围的世界，但在他们的Eberron上没有人类或精灵。根据吉斯泽拉人的说法，当daelkyr完成他们在Eberron的工作时，他们将吉斯人的世界从存在中抹去，创造了一个新的现实。如果这是真的，他们可能已经做了无数次......如果他们打破守门人的封印，他们可以再做一次。吉斯泽拉人最终希望实现的是将他们的现实重新放到物质世界中。",
	"It's possible that the gith are deluded about all of this. Even if the gith myth is true, it's doubtful the githzerai will ever have the strength to rewrite reality. But can it be entirely dismissed? Note that the draconic allies of the githyanki are descended from dragons from the gith Eberron; they have no loyalty to Argonnessen, and could be a curious wild card.": "吉斯人有可能对这一切产生了错觉。即使吉斯人的神话是真的，也很怀疑吉斯人是否有力量改写现实。但它能被完全否定吗？请注意，吉特希恩基的龙族盟友是来自吉斯-艾伯伦的龙的后裔；他们对阿贡尼森没有忠诚，可能是一张奇怪的野牌。",
	"Time moves strangely in Kythri and the Astral Plane, and the gith could've been dwelling in Kythri and raiding reality for thousands of years—or it could be that from their perspective, the destruction of reality was barely a century ago. Are the githyanki led by an ancient lich-queen, or by Gith herself?": "在Kythri和星界，时间的流动很奇怪，吉斯人可能已经在Kythri居住了几千年，并袭击了现实，或者从他们的角度来看，现实的毁灭仅仅是一个世纪前。githyanki是由一个古老的lich-queen领导的，还是由gith自己领导的？",
	"No one knows if there's a greater power shaping Kythri. The death slaadi are powerful beings, but there's no known equivalent to Dolurrh's Queen of the Dead or Dal Quor's il-Lashtavar. Some sages assert that there must be a consciousness at the heart of the Sea of Chaos, a sentience behind the chaos, but if so, its presence has never been proven.": "没有人知道是否有一种更强大的力量在塑造Kythri。死亡萨拉迪是强大的存在，但没有已知的与多鲁尔的亡灵女王或达尔-库尔的il-Lashtavar相当的存在。一些圣人断言，在混沌之海的中心一定有一个意识，一个在混沌背后的智者，但如果是这样，它的存在从未被证实。",
	"Unlike many planes, Kythri isn't divided into layers. Its structure is closer to that of Dal Quor; it has a planar core, with islands of reality suspended within the Sea of Chaos. The difference is that the core of Dal Quor is stable—while in Kythri, the closer you get to the heart of the sea, the more tumultuous it becomes.": "与许多星球不同，Kythri并没有被划分为不同的层次。它的结构更接近于达尔-库尔（Dal Quor）；它有一个平面核心，在混沌之海中悬浮着一些现实的岛屿。不同的是，达尔-库尔的核心是稳定的，而在凯斯里，你越接近海的中心，它就越动荡不安。",
	"There are many slaad communities spread across the Shifting Islands, and at least half a dozen githzerai monastery vessels in the Sea of Chaos. Cornerstone and Zertherun IV are examples that can be used as inspiration.": "有许多slaad社区分布在移居群岛，混沌之海中至少有半打githzerai修道院的船只。基石号和泽瑟伦四号是可以作为灵感的例子。",
	"Space has little meaning in the Sea of Chaos. Matter, distance, and gravity are in constant flux. Lands and creatures appear and dissolve within moments. There are waves of lightning, streams of lava, and hurricane winds constantly shifting direction. While the elements may be mundane—unlike the surreal vistas of Xoriat—size has little meaning. A thousand-foot-long dragon turtle might appear, try to swallow travelers, then become an island.": "空间在混沌之海中没有什么意义。物质、距离和重力都在不断地变化。土地和生物在瞬间出现和消失。有闪电波、熔岩流和飓风不断改变方向。虽然这些元素可能是平凡的，但与Xoriat的超现实景观不同，尺寸没有什么意义。一只长达一千英尺的龙龟可能会出现，试图吞下旅行者，然后变成一个岛屿。",
	"Travel through the Sea of Chaos is driven by pure will. Travelers must impose the concept of motion and distance on the environment using great mental focus, while also protecting their vessel from both the destructive forces and from being transformed. The DM could reflect this journey with a series of ability checks, or simply require the adventurers to have a captain and vessel capable of making the trip before they try to cross the sea. Regardless, to successfully travel, the adventurers must know where they want to go; without a destination to serve as a conceptual anchor, they'll quickly crash on a random Shifting Island.": "在混沌之海的旅行是由纯粹的意志驱动的。旅行者必须用极大的精神集中力将运动和距离的概念强加给环境，同时还要保护他们的船只不受破坏力和被改造的影响。管理员可以用一系列的能力检查来反映这个旅程，或者干脆要求冒险者在尝试渡海之前有一个船长和船只能够完成这次旅行。无论如何，要想成功旅行，冒险者必须知道他们想去哪里；如果没有一个目的地作为概念上的锚，他们很快就会坠落在一个随机的变幻岛。",
	"There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard. The DM can use the tables in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to determine weather, rolling again whenever it seems interesting to do so.": "混乱之海的边缘有无数的岛屿，大小不一，各有各的环境。这些都是不断变化的，但它们的变化很慢；一个岛屿从贫瘠的沙漠转变为青翠的丛林，可能需要一天到一周的时间。天气通常更有活力，而且经常与环境相冲突；一片广阔的沙漠可能突然面临一场戏剧性的暴风雪。DM可以使用《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第五章中的表格来确定天气，只要觉得有趣，就可以再次滚动。",
	"Other tables in that chapter can also be quite useful for determining the chaotic content of an island; the Monuments and Wierd Locales tables are a way to provide ideas for random discoveries, thought he DM can adjust them to fith the story and the theme. Keep in mind that Kythri is home to {@creature mimic||mimics} of all sizes; an unusual monument might be a colossal mimic!": "该章中的其他表格对于确定一个岛屿的混乱内容也是相当有用的；纪念碑和怪异地点表是为随机发现提供想法的一种方式，DM可以根据故事和主题来调整它们。请记住，Kythri是各种尺寸的（%0%）的家园；一个不寻常的纪念碑可能是一个巨大的模仿者",
	"The primary denizens of the Shifting Island are monstrosities and beasts that blend the features of multiple creatures. Populations expand and contract, and don't have to be sustainable, so adventurers could find a plateau filled with griffons, or a realm of chimeras where each one has a different arrangement of heads. The intelligent inhabitants of the island are almost entirely slaadi, but they aren't neccessarily hostile. The {@table Slaad Cultures|ExploringEberron} table earlier in the section can give ideas about their motives, and the Random Settlements tables in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} can generate a random slaad community.

Items that come from Kythri may have unpredictable effects.

But when you come to Lamannia, there are many predators, and you are prey; anyone who seeks to despoil the embodiment of nature will be hunted.": "拉曼尼亚靠近这个世界，是最容易到达的星球之一。它的宝藏是被注入元素力量的自然物体--木材、石头、草药和植物，它们都比凡人的同类更强大、更有力量。但是，当你来到拉曼尼亚时，有许多掠夺者，而你就是猎物；任何试图掠夺大自然的化身的人都会被猎杀。",
	"Lamannia is a reflection of the natural world, intensified and exaggerated. The air is pure and clean, the water fresh and clear. Colors are impossibly vivid. It's suffused with life—a realm in which any stone could be an earth elemental, where any tree could be awakened. Vegetation is nearly always in bloom, and beasts are almost always in the peak of health. Except for a few layers such as the Rot, Lamannia reflects the ideal state of the natural world. Here are some of the plane's consistent properties.": "拉曼尼亚是自然界的反映，被强化和夸张了。空气是纯净的，水是新鲜的，清澈的。颜色鲜艳得不可思议。它充满了生命力--一个任何石头都可以成为土元素，任何树木都可以被唤醒的境界。植被几乎总是盛开的，野兽几乎总是处于健康的巅峰状态。除了腐烂等少数层次，拉曼尼亚反映了自然世界的理想状态。以下是该飞机的一些一贯属性。",
	"When a creature casts a druid spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer while in Lamannia, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected. A DM could decide to extend this effect to other characters that draw on primal sources of magic, such as a Gatekeeper ranger or a Greensinger bard.": "当生物在拉曼尼亚时施放持续时间为1分钟或以上的德鲁伊法术时，持续时间会翻倍。持续时间为24小时或以上的法术不受影响。DM可以决定将这一效果扩展到其他利用原始魔法来源的角色，比如守门人游侠或绿星吟游诗人。",
	"Beasts and elementals have a +2 bonus to Constitution and advantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws. Upon its arrival in Lamannia, any elemental or beast that's charmed or bound in any way is immediately freed from that effect; this can be disastrous for an elemental airship that's thrown into the plane.": "野兽和元素有一个+2的体质加成，以及在智慧、智力和魅力方面的优势。抵达拉曼尼亚后，任何被魅惑或以任何方式被束缚的元素或野兽都会立即摆脱这种影响；这对于被扔进飞机的元素飞艇来说是灾难性的。",
	"When a creature casts a spell that summons or conjures an elemental, it does so as if the spell were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.": "当一个生物施展召唤或召唤元素的法术时，它所做的就像该法术的等级比所消耗的法术槽高一级一样。",
	"A creature has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks made to forage for food or shelter. In most layers of Lamannia, the vegetation is bountiful and the land sustaining. (While in the Broken Land, it may be very difficult to forage, but you'll at least have advantage to help you with the roll!)": "一个生物在寻找食物或住所的智慧检查中具有优势。在拉曼尼亚的大部分区域，植被丰富，土地可持续。(在破碎之地，觅食可能非常困难，但你至少会有优势来帮助你翻身！）。",
	"It's difficult to destroy or contaminate the matter of Lamannia. All nonmagical food and drink is purified and rendered free of poison and disease. In addition, natural materials such as wood and stone are tougher than their mundane counterparts. When trying to destroy objects made of Lamannian materials, increase the Armor Class suggested in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} by 3, and double the hit points of the object.": "要破坏或污染拉曼尼亚的物质是很难的。所有非魔法的食物和饮料都被净化，没有毒和疾病。此外，木头和石头等天然材料比世俗的同类材料更坚硬。当试图摧毁由拉曼尼亚材料制成的物体时，将{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第八章中建议的装甲等级增加3，并将该物体的命中率提高一倍。",
	"Lamannia's primary inhabitants are beasts—both ones that you might encounter in the wilds of Eberron, and massive creatures that can be seen as iconic representations of their type: the idealized incarnation of Bear or Wolf. Any natural creature can be found in Lamannia; indeed, some sages assert that the presence of a creature in Lamannia is what defines it as \"natural.\"": "拉曼尼亚的主要居民是野兽--既有你可能在埃伯龙的荒野中遇到的野兽，也有可以被视为其类型的标志性代表的大型生物：熊或狼的理想化身。任何自然生物都可以在拉曼尼亚找到；事实上，一些圣人断言，一个生物在拉曼尼亚的存在就是它的 \"自然 \"定义。",
	"For the most part, Lamannian beasts are no smarter than their counterparts on Eberron. However, some animals possess intelligence similar to that granted by the awaken spell, though even these beasts generally follow their natural instincts and live wild lives. While the giant owls of Sharn may own shops and run for city council, the giant owls of Lamannia are content to hunt the beasts of the Twilight Forest. So it's possible to find creatures in Lamannia that speak Common or a Primordial dialect, but most have little interest in long conversations.": "在大多数情况下，拉曼尼亚的野兽并不比Eberron的同类动物聪明。然而，有些动物拥有类似于觉醒咒语所赋予的智慧，不过即使是这些野兽也通常遵循它们的自然本能，过着野生的生活。沙恩的巨鸮可能拥有商店并竞选市议会，而拉曼尼亚的巨鸮则满足于狩猎暮色森林的野兽。因此，在拉曼尼亚有可能找到会说普通话或原始方言的生物，但大多数对长篇大论没有兴趣。",
	"The beasts of Lamannia generally fall into the following four categories.": "拉曼尼亚的魔兽一般分为以下四类。",
	"are identical to their counterparts in Eberron. Any natural creature can be found in a layer with an appropriate environment. If such beasts are the first things adventurers encounter in a visit to Lamannia, they might not even realize they've traveled to another plane.": "与Eberron中的对应物完全相同。任何自然生物都可以在一个有适当环境的层中找到。如果这样的野兽是冒险者在访问拉曼尼亚时遇到的第一件事，他们甚至可能没有意识到自己已经来到了另一个位面。",
	"are creatures of remarkable size. Such creatures are more common than mundane animals; in the Twilight Forest, most owls are giant owls, and they prey on giant weasels and rats. The {@book Monster Manual|mm} has a few examples of \"dire\" and \"giant\" beasts, but any natural beast could have a dire counterpart in Lamannia.": "是具有非凡体型的生物。这种生物比世俗动物更常见；在暮色森林，大多数猫头鹰是巨型猫头鹰，它们捕食巨型黄鼠狼和老鼠。{@book Monster Manual|mm}有一些 \"可怕 \"和 \"巨型 \"野兽的例子，但任何自然界的野兽在拉曼尼亚都可能有可怕的对应物。",
	"re gargantuan beasts. The roc is an example of Lamannian megafauna; those found in Eberron have been drawn through manifest zones or slipped between planes during coterminous periods. The DM can create a wide range of megafauna; a pack of gargantuan wolves could hound the adventurers, or they might meet a megafauna serpent that uses the statistics of a purple work—perhaps even a megafauna dinosaur! While these creatures are similar in form to beasts, they are typically classified as monstrosities. Between their vast size and their connection to the plane, they're immune to most effects that target beasts, and you can't charm a roc with a simple {@spell animal friendship} spell.": "巨大的野兽。大鹏鸟是拉曼尼亚巨型动物的一个例子；那些在Eberron发现的巨型动物都是在同时期通过显化区被吸引过来的，或者在不同的位面之间溜走。DM可以创造各种各样的巨型动物；一群巨大的狼可以围攻冒险者，或者他们可能会遇到一条使用紫色作品的统计数据的巨型蛇类--也许甚至是一只巨型恐龙！虽然这些生物的形态与大鹏鸟相似，但它们都有一个共同的特点，那就是它们都有一个共同的名字--大鹏。虽然这些生物的形态与野兽相似，但它们通常被归类为畸形生物。在它们巨大的体型和与平面的联系之间，它们对大多数针对野兽的效果都是免疫的，而且你不能用简单的（%0%）法术来魅惑大鹏。",
	"are beasts that are beyond the tactical scale—creatures that can be measured in miles. The gnome explorer Tasker tells a tale of an island in the Endless Ocean that turned out to be an enormous turtle; another of his stories features a pack of lycanthropes living in the fur of a massive roaming wolf. Such totems aren't natural creatures and don't need to eat. Their origins and purpose are unsolved mysteries, but most sages believe that they are immortal spirits projected by the plane itself. Some claim that the totems are connected to all creatures cast in their image. Others believe that the totems are sources of primal power, and barbarians, shifters, and druids can receive power and guidance from them. All that's known for sure is that they're immune to common spells, and there are no accounts of anyone successfully harming or communicating with a totem.": "是超越战术尺度的野兽--可以用英里来衡量的生物。地精探险家塔斯克（Tasker）讲述了一个关于无尽之海中一个岛屿的故事，这个岛屿原来是一只巨大的乌龟；他的另一个故事是一群狼人住在一只巨大的漫游狼的皮毛里。这种图腾不是自然生物，不需要吃东西。它们的起源和目的是未解之谜，但大多数圣人认为它们是飞机本身投射的不朽精神。有些人声称，图腾与所有按其形象铸造的生物有关。还有人认为，图腾是原始力量的来源，野蛮人、移居者和德鲁伊可以从它们那里获得力量和指导。目前可以确定的是，它们对普通法术免疫，而且没有任何人成功地伤害图腾或与之交流的记载。",
	"After beasts, the most common inhabitants of the plane are elementals. Unlike the genies, mephits, and anthropomorphic elementals of Fernia and Syrania, Lamannia's elementals are the pure, living essence of the elements, unburdened by any humanoid desire. These include the standard earth, fire, air, and water elementals, but they can come in a wide array of sizes and forms. Adventurers exploring the Broken Lands could encounter tiny globs of lava crawling across the land, while the leviathans of the Endless Ocean and the elder tempests of the First Storm are forces of apocalyptic power.": "在野兽之后，这个星球上最常见的居民是元素人。与费尔尼亚和锡拉尼亚的精灵、梅菲特和拟人化的元素不同，拉曼尼亚的元素是纯粹的、活生生的元素精华，不受任何人形欲望的影响。这些元素包括标准的土、火、空气和水元素，但它们可以有各种各样的大小和形式。探索破碎之地的冒险者们可能会遇到在陆地上爬行的小熔岩团，而无尽之海的暴君和第一风暴的长老风暴则是具有世界末日般的力量。",
	"The Zil gnomes commonly summon and bind the elementals of Lamannia, using them to propel lightning rails and airships. While intelligent, these elementals are utterly alien. They have little concept of time and perceive the world purely through the balance of elements. The sole desire of most elementals is to express their element: to {@i burn}, to {@i flow}, to {@i fly}. Many have an antagonistic attitude toward spirits of other elements, which drives the deadly conflict between them in the Broken Land—this poses an obstacle in dealing with elementals, as they tend to perceive humanoids as globs of water. While it's possible for a character that speaks Primordial to talk with a Lamannian elemental, it's usually difficult to establish any sort of common basis for negotiation. Still, there are legends of wandering druids who \"befriended earth and air,\" so anything is possible!": "齐尔地精通常召唤和束缚拉曼尼亚的元素，用它们来推动闪电轨道和飞艇。虽然有智慧，但这些元素体是完全陌生的。他们对时间没有什么概念，纯粹通过元素的平衡来感知世界。大多数元素人的唯一愿望是表达他们的元素：对（%0%），对（%1%），对（%2%）。许多人对其他元素的精神有一种对立的态度，这促使他们在破碎之地发生致命的冲突--这给与元素人打交道带来了障碍，因为他们倾向于将人类视为水球状。虽然说原始语的角色有可能与拉曼尼亚元素交谈，但通常很难建立任何形式的共同谈判基础。尽管如此，仍有关于流浪德鲁伊 \"与大地和空气结为朋友 \"的传说，所以一切皆有可能",
	"There are merfolk in Eberron—such as the Kalamer of the Thunder Sea—but their people began in the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, and are still found there. These primordial merfolk remain close to their elemental roots and instincts. They wield druidic magic, but don't craft tools or structures. Other humanoid natives of Lamannia are much the same; any race with a strong primal connection could be tied to Lamannia, but they're driven by instinct and avoid the trappings of civilization. There could be tabaxi dwelling in the branches of the Twilight Forest, but if so, they'll seem wild.": "在Eberron也有人鱼族--比如雷海的卡拉默--但他们的族人开始于拉曼尼亚的无尽之海，并且仍然在那里被发现。这些原始的人鱼族仍然接近于他们的元素根源和本能。他们挥舞着德鲁伊的魔法，但不制作工具或结构。拉曼尼亚的其他人形土著也是如此；任何具有强烈原始联系的种族都可能与拉曼尼亚联系在一起，但他们受本能驱动，避免文明的束缚。可能有Tabaxi住在暮色森林的树枝上，但如果是这样，他们就会显得很野蛮。",
	"Over a century ago, during the Silver Crusade, there were many lycanthropes who fled to Lamannia. As long as they remain on this plane, a lycanthrope can't spread the curse to anyone other than their offspring, and the unnatural impulses of the curse—the drive to prey on innocents, the bloodlust that can cause a victim of lycanthropy to lose control of their actions—are suspended. Meanwhile, primal instincts are amplified; Lamannian werewolves remain predators and take joy in the hunt, but they aren't driven to evil, and remain in full control. Packs and communities of lycanthropes are scattered across the layers. Most are descended from lycanthropes who fled Eberron to escape both the templars and the dark power whose corrupting influence led to the crusade; these shapeshifters embrace their primal nature and rarely assume humanoid forms. But there are also packs descended from afflicted templars who chose exile over death, and who strive to preserve the beliefs and traditions of their ancestors.": "一个多世纪以前，在银色十字军东征期间，有许多狼人逃到拉曼尼亚。只要他们留在这个星球上，狼人就不能把诅咒传播给他们的后代以外的任何人，而且诅咒的非自然冲动--捕食无辜者的驱动力，可能导致狼人的受害者失去对自己行为的控制的嗜血性--被暂停。同时，原始的本能被放大了；拉曼尼亚狼人仍然是捕食者，并以狩猎为乐，但他们并没有被驱使到邪恶的境地，仍然完全受控。狼人的群落和社区散布在各层。大多数狼人是逃离Eberron的狼人的后代，他们为了躲避圣殿骑士和黑暗势力的腐蚀而导致十字军东征；这些变身者拥抱他们的原始本性，很少变成人形。但也有一些受折磨的圣殿骑士的后代，他们选择流亡而不是死亡，并努力维护他们祖先的信仰和传统。",
	"A handful of druids and rangers have crossed into Lamannia and chosen to remain in this primal paradise. Many run with lycanthrope packs, embracing their feral instincts and spending their days in wild shape. Others act as planar shepherds, seeking to minimize the impact of dangerous manifest zones and help unwary travelers.": "少数德鲁伊和游侠已经进入拉曼尼亚，并选择留在这个原始的天堂。许多人与狼人群体一起奔跑，拥抱他们的野性本能，在野性中度过他们的日子。其他人则扮演着平面牧羊人的角色，试图将危险地带的影响降到最低，并帮助不小心的旅行者。",
	"There are no celestials or fiends in Lamannia. Yet explorers often report a feeling that they are being watched, and there are times when random events seem to be guided by an unseen hand. When outsiders have sought to establish industries in Lamannia, they've been attacked by megafauna or elder elementals, or struck by especially vicious turns of weather. It's possible that this is the work of the totems, and that they have great influence over their layers. Or there could be a greater power that watches over the entire plane. Some scholars assert that the moon Olarune is the consciousness that governs the plane, and Eldeen shifter traditions that predate the practices of the Wardens of the Wood also reflect this belief. Shifter druids suggest that Olarune created the shifters, and the first lycanthropes were her champions.": "在拉曼尼亚没有天神或魔鬼。然而，探险家们经常报告说，他们有一种被监视的感觉，而且有时随机事件似乎被一只看不见的手所引导。当外来者试图在拉曼尼亚建立工业时，他们会受到巨型动物或长老元素的攻击，或者受到特别邪恶的天气的打击。这有可能是图腾的工作，它们对其层有很大的影响。也可能有一种更大的力量在监视着整个平面。一些学者断言，月亮Olarune是管理这个平面的意识，而早于森林守护者做法的Eldeen移居者传统也反映了这种信念。变形者德鲁伊认为，奥拉鲁恩创造了变形者，而第一批狼人是她的拥护者。",
	"Each of Lamannia's layers highlights a particular aspect of primal nature. One layer in Lamannia might contain a single colossal mountain peak; on the other hand, the Twilight Forest could be as large as Khorvaire (or even Eberron itself). The edge of a layer could be an impassable physical barrier, or it could wrap around onto itself—if you sail far enough in the Endless Ocean, you'll find yourself back where you began. Most layers of Lamannia follow a traditional day-night cycle, though they aren't synchronized across layers, and when the moon Olarune is visible, it's always full.": "拉曼尼亚的每一层都突出了原始自然的一个特定方面。拉曼尼亚的某一层可能包含一座巨大的山峰；另一方面，暮色森林可能和霍尔韦尔（甚至是埃伯龙本身）一样大。一个层的边缘可能是一个不可逾越的物理屏障，或者它可以环绕到自己身上--如果你在无尽之海中航行得足够远，你会发现自己回到了开始的地方。拉曼尼亚的大多数层都遵循传统的昼夜周期，尽管它们在各层之间并不同步，而且当月亮Olarune被看到时，它总是满的。",
	"The portals that connect the layers of Lamannia often only allow travel in one direction. Any deep pool of water may connect a layer to the Endless Ocean; but while you can get to the Ocean by diving into a pond in the Twilight Forest, there's no gate back to the forest on the other side. The Endless Ocean contains small islands, and if you explore one, you'll find you've moved to a new layer.": "连接拉曼尼亚各层的传送门通常只允许朝一个方向旅行。任何一个深水池都可以将一个层级与无尽之海连接起来；但是当你潜入暮色森林的池塘就可以到达海洋，在另一边却没有门可以回到森林。无尽之海中有一些小岛，如果你探索其中一个，你会发现你已经移到了一个新的楼层。",
	"The following are just a handful of Lamannia's many layers. In creating a layer, think of a distinctive natural feature—a canyon, a desert, a lone mountain—and build the layer around it. What creatures would be found there? Have any outsiders taken up residence? Is there an unusual role for elementals? How does it connect to other layers or Eberron?": "以下只是Lamannia众多层次中的一小部分。在创建一个图层时，考虑一个独特的自然特征--峡谷、沙漠、孤山--然后围绕它建立图层。那里会有什么生物？是否有外来者居住？是否有元素的不寻常作用？它与其他层或Eberron有什么联系？",
	"The sky is hidden by the dense canopy of this vast rainforest, leaving the forest floor in an endless twilight. The trees are over a hundred feet in height—impressive, certainly, though not as tall as the greatpines of the Towering Wood in the Eldeen Reaches. But as people further explore the Twilight Forest, they come upon strange ridges and walls of wood, some forming twisted wooden canyons. Following these, explorers discover they're the roots of unimaginably colossal trees, vast titans wider and taller than the towers of Sharn. The Twilight Forest as mortals experience it lies in the shadow of the grander canopy that rises far above it, and these enormous trees are home to megafauna and mightier beings.": "天空被这片广袤的雨林茂密的树冠遮住了，只留下森林地面上无尽的暮色。树木的高度超过100英尺--当然令人印象深刻，虽然没有Eldeen Reaches的Towering Wood的大松树那么高。但当人们进一步探索暮色森林时，他们会发现奇怪的山脊和木墙，有些形成了扭曲的木质峡谷。沿着这些，探险者们发现它们是难以想象的巨树的根部，比沙恩的塔楼更宽更高的巨大巨人。凡人所经历的黄昏森林位于远在其上的更大的树冠的阴影之下，而这些巨大的树木是巨型动物和更强大的生命的家园。",
	"Though the Twilight Forest is wild and untamed, explorers can find wide cleared paths through the lower forest. Survival experts may recognize that these aren't trails created by humanoid hands; rather, they're the paths of totems, who have crushed the lesser forest beneath their colossal feet. The forest is filled with beasts—mundane and dire creatures in the lower forests, megafauna in the grand canopy above it, and the occasional passage of totems. There are multiple communities of lycanthropes scattered throughout the lower forest. A clan of wererats have carved out a warren in the roots of a colossal tree, while a pack of wild wereboars feuds with werewolves descended from exiled templars. An ancient elf druid named Haral, who spends most of her time in the form of an owl, does her best to maintain order; she is assisted in this by a megafauna owl she calls Ruark.": "虽然黄昏森林是野生的、未被驯服的，但探险者可以在低层森林中找到宽阔的清扫路径。生存专家可能会认识到，这些小路并不是由人形之手创造的；相反，它们是图腾的道路，它们将较小的森林压在自己巨大的脚下。森林里到处都是野兽--低层森林里的世俗和可怕的生物，上方大树冠里的巨型动物，以及偶尔通过的图腾。在低层森林中散布着多个狼人社区。一群狼人在一棵巨大的树的根部开辟了一个巢穴，而一群野生的狼人与被流放的圣殿骑士的后代狼人发生争执。一个名叫哈拉尔的古代精灵德鲁伊，大部分时间都以猫头鹰的形态存在，她尽力维持秩序；她在这方面得到了一只被她称为鲁阿克的巨型动物猫头鹰的帮助。",
	"The forest has many other inhabitants, and a few minor elementals can be found in this layer. A gust of wind, a pool of water, a rolling stone—in Lamannia, any of these things could be {@i alive}.": "森林里有许多其他居民，在这一层可以找到一些小的元素。一阵风，一池水，一块滚动的石头，在拉曼尼亚，这些东西都可能是（%0%）。",
	"The Broken Land is a volcanic region filled with high mountains and lava plains. There are constant eruptions, and the layer is home to many fire and earth elementals that engage in an ongoing environmental conflict. Fire elementals flow out with the lava as volcanoes erupt; earth elementals work to contain the eruptions and to rebuild the shattered peaks, only to have them erupt again. Few beasts manage to thrive in this layer, but some tough dinosaurs have clawed out a niche. While this region has fewer connections to Eberron than the Twilight Forest, it's also possible to find remnants of other travelers here; it's a harsh and deadly landscape for stranded adventurers or for those who seek a lost relic from this place.": "破碎之地是一个充满高山和熔岩平原的火山地区。这里不断有火山爆发，该层是许多火元素和土元素的家园，它们参与了一场持续的环境冲突。火元素在火山爆发时随熔岩流出；土元素则致力于控制火山爆发，并重建破碎的山峰，只是为了让它们再次爆发。很少有野兽能在这一层茁壮成长，但一些坚韧的恐龙已经抓出了一个小天地。虽然这个地区与Eberron的联系比暮色森林少，但也有可能在这里找到其他旅行者的遗迹；对于受困的冒险者或寻找这里的失落遗物的人来说，这里是一片严酷而致命的风景。",
	"This layer reflects the majesty of the ocean depths. It's home to a vast array of fish and aquatic beasts, along with merfolk tribes and a wide range of water elementals, from simple sentient currents and weirds to massive leviathans and battling megafauna. The Endless Ocean is where the gnome Tasker encountered an island that turned out to be a totem turtle. True islands are few and far between, and most are actually portals to other layers of Lamannia. There are many points in the Endless Ocean tied to manifest zones (most located in ocean depths) in the Material Plane.": "这一层反映了海洋深处的威严。它是大量鱼类和水生动物的家园，还有人鱼部落和各种水元素，从简单的有知觉的水流和鸟类到巨大的利维坦和战斗的巨型动物。无尽的海洋是地精Tasker遇到一个岛屿的地方，结果是一个图腾龟。真正的岛屿少之又少，而且大多数实际上是通往拉曼尼亚其他层的门户。无尽之海中有许多点与物质界的显现区（大部分位于海洋深处）相联系。",
	"A layer of plains and low hills, this region is permanently lashed by hurricane winds and endless storms. Beasts huddle in caves and the limited shelter, while all manner of elementals clash in the storm-lashed plains. A massive elder tempest drives the heart of the storm; during the Sundering of Sarlona, an apocalyptic cult in Ohr Kaluun sought to bring this elemental to Eberron, believing it would destroy the world.": "这片区域由平原和低矮的山丘组成，长期受到飓风和无尽风暴的侵袭。野兽们蜷缩在洞穴和有限的庇护所中，而各种元素则在被风暴袭击的平原上发生冲突。一个巨大的长老风暴驱动着风暴的中心；在萨尔罗纳的毁灭中，奥赫-卡鲁恩的一个世界末日邪教组织试图将这种元素带到艾伯伦，认为它将毁灭世界。",
	"Decay is part of nature, and this is reflected in the swamp-like Rot, a relatively small layer filled with fallen, rotting trees. Corpses of megafauna beasts lie scattered around the layer, and giant insects and other massive scavengers prey on their remains. There's a community of wererats thriving in the Rot, and there could be a small outpost of the Children of Winter who found their way here. While the Rot is a symbol of death and decay, it's entirely natural, and undead have no place here. IT's possible a necromancer could arrive here, hoping to animate the massive corpsese; however, this would violate the theme of the plane, and if there's any higher power at work in Lamannia, it would certianly direct forces to counter this. While most layers of Lamannia are free from disease, disease itself is part of nature; a manifest zone tied to the Rot could spread plagues into the surrounding region.": "腐烂是自然的一部分，这反映在沼泽般的腐烂中，这是一个相对较小的层，充满了倒下的、腐烂的树木。巨型动物的尸体散落在该层周围，巨型昆虫和其他大型食腐动物捕食它们的残骸。有一个狼人社区在腐烂层中繁衍生息，这里可能有一个冬之子的小前哨，他们在这里找到了自己的路。虽然腐烂区是死亡和腐烂的象征，但它是完全自然的，亡灵在这里没有地位。一个死灵法师有可能来到这里，希望使巨大的尸体复活；然而，这将违反这个星球的主题，如果在拉曼尼亚有任何更高的力量在起作用，它肯定会引导力量来对抗这种情况。虽然拉曼尼亚的大部分楼层都没有疾病，但疾病本身就是自然的一部分；一个与腐烂有关的显化区可能会将瘟疫传播到周围地区。",
	"Lamannia is filled with precious natural resources; it's hardly surprising that an advanced civilization would try to harvest them. During the Age of Giants, the Group of Eleven set up a research station and mining camp in a layer of Lamannia. After a decade struggling against megafauna attacks and elemental-enhanced weather, the outpost was finally overwhelmed and abandoned. It's a testament to the arcane engineering of the giants that anything remains of this structure... although it may be that it remains because the ruin itself has become a symbol of nature reclaiming civilization. Vines and moss cover shattered walls, and the bones of giants are scattered throughout the remnants of this garrison. Valuable and powerful treasures may well be hidden in the Folly, but explorers will have to contend with aggressive elementals, dangerous beasts, and traps left by the long-dead giants themselves.": "拉曼尼亚充满了珍贵的自然资源；一个先进的文明会试图收获它们，这并不奇怪。在巨人时代，11人集团在拉曼尼亚的一层建立了一个研究站和采矿营地。在与巨型动物的攻击和元素增强的天气斗争了十年之后，这个前哨站终于被压倒并放弃了。这是巨人的神秘工程的一个证明，这个结构还保留着任何东西......尽管它可能是因为废墟本身已经成为大自然收回文明的象征。藤蔓和苔藓覆盖着破碎的墙壁，巨人的骨头散落在这个驻军的遗迹中。富利中很可能隐藏着宝贵而强大的宝藏，但探险者将不得不与咄咄逼人的元素、危险的野兽以及早已死去的巨人自己留下的陷阱作斗争。",
	"A town is established in the desolate Blade Desert, but it thrives beside a small lake that provides fresh water and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fish. In a small Eldeen village, the locals live in harmony with a breed of giant rabbits unknown elsewhere in Khorvaire. A tribe of shifters lives in the branches of three massive trees that grow in a Lamannian manifest zone. These are all examples of how Lamannia can affect the Material Plane; below are a few more.": "在荒凉的刀锋沙漠中建立了一个城镇，但它在一个提供淡水和似乎取之不尽的鱼的小湖边蓬勃发展。在Eldeen的一个小村庄里，当地人与霍尔韦尔其他地方未知的巨兔品种和谐相处。一个移居者部落生活在三棵巨大的树的树枝上，这三棵树生长在拉曼尼亚的显要地带。这些都是拉曼尼亚如何影响物质世界的例子；下面还有一些例子。",
	"Lamannian manifest zones are relatively common, and usually share one or more of the plane's universal properties. They're often found at the heart of a region that resembles the connected layer; zones tied to the Endless Ocean are found underwater, while manifest zones tied to the Twilight Forest can be found in the Towering Wood, the King's Forest, and other vast woodlands. It's relatively common for these zones to serve as gateways to Lamannia, though they might require a lunar alignment or a coterminous period. This goes in reverse too, as creatures can be pulled through to the Material Plane, from hostile elementals to deadly megafauna.": "拉曼尼亚人的显灵区比较常见，通常与该平面的一个或多个通用属性相同。它们通常被发现在一个类似于连接层的区域的中心；与无尽海洋相连的区域被发现在水下，而与暮色森林相连的显灵区可以在高耸的森林、国王的森林和其他广阔的林地中找到。这些区域作为进入拉曼尼亚的门户是比较常见的，尽管它们可能需要月球的排列或同位素的时期。这也是反过来的，因为生物可以被拉到物质界，从敌对的元素到致命的巨型动物。",
	"Zilargo has a number of valuable zones with the Elemental Power property, and House Cannith and the Twelve are eager to find more of these zones—though they're also dangerous, as elementals sometimes spontaneously manifest in such places, linger for a few hours, then dissipate. Bound elementals can also break free from their bonds in some Lamannian manifest zones—especially unfortunate if that elemental is responsible for keeping an airship aloft!": "Zilargo有许多具有元素力量属性的宝贵区域，坎尼斯家族和十二人组都渴望找到更多这样的区域--尽管它们也很危险，因为元素有时会自发地在这些地方显现出来，逗留几个小时，然后消散。被束缚的元素也可以在一些拉曼尼亚的显现区挣脱束缚--如果该元素负责维持飞艇的飞行，那就特别不幸了！\"。",
	"Plants and beasts near Lamannian zones often are significantly larger and healthier than their counterparts in other areas, and many House Vadalis enclaves are built in these zones. Zones with the Primordial Matter property can also be a valuable resource for communities, with purified food and water and the presence of extremely durable wood and other materials for industry. The prison of Dreadhold is built in such a manifest zone.": "拉曼尼亚区附近的植物和野兽往往比其他地区的同类植物和野兽要大得多、健康得多，许多House Vadalis的飞地都建在这些区域。具有原始物质属性的区域也可以成为社区的宝贵资源，有净化的食物和水，以及极其耐用的木材和其他工业材料的存在。Dreadhold的监狱就建在这样的显化区。",
	"However, though Lamannian manifest zones can be useful tools for communities and dragonmarked houses, some zones actively resist and repel civilization. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay can combine to quickly destroy structures built in the zone and overgrow the ruins": "然而，尽管拉曼尼亚人的表现区可以成为社区和龙纹屋的有用工具，但有些区域却积极抵制和排斥文明。天气、植被和快速的腐烂速度可以迅速摧毁建在该区的结构，并使废墟过度生长。",
	"While Lamannia is coterminous, the effects of Lamannian manifest zones are enhanced. In regions of unspoiled nature—such as the Eldeen Reaches and the wilds of Q'barra—fertility of both plants and animals is enhanced, and beasts conceived in these periods are often exceptionally strong and healthy. Spells that target beasts or elementals are extended; if a spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.": "虽然拉曼尼亚是同源的，但拉曼尼亚显灵区的影响却得到了加强。在自然界未受破坏的地区--如Eldeen Reaches和Q'barra的荒野--植物和动物的生育能力都会增强，在这些时期孕育的野兽通常都特别强壮和健康。以野兽或元素为目标的法术会被延长；如果一个法术的持续时间为1分钟或更长，则持续时间会翻倍；持续时间为24小时或更长的法术不受影响。",
	"While Lamannia is remote, fertility rates drop, and beasts born in these periods are often weak or sickly. Animals are often uneasy, and the duration of spells that affect beasts or elementals are cut in half, to a minimum duration of one round.": "当拉曼尼亚处于偏远地区时，生育率下降，在这些时期出生的野兽通常是虚弱的或生病的。动物们常常感到不安，影响野兽或元素的法术持续时间减半，最短持续时间为一回合。",
	"Lamannia traditionally becomes coterminous for a week around the summer solstice, and is remote for a week during the winter solstice.": "传统上，Lamannia在夏至前后会有一周的同位素，而在冬至期间则会有一周的偏远。",
	"Lamannian vegetation is prized by alchemists. Herbs and roots from Lamannia can produce exceptionally strong potions, and many types of Lamannian vegetation have innate magical effects; there are bushes in the Twilight Forest that naturally produce {@spell goodberry||goodberries}. Lamannian lumber likewise can have unusual properties, mirroring the densewood and bronzewood found in Aerenal. Lamannian wood and stone can serve as powerful focuses for primal magic, for creating {@item figurine of wondrous power||figurines of wondrous power}, or for tools designed to summon or bind elementals.": "拉曼尼亚的植物被炼金术士所珍视。拉曼尼亚的草药和根茎可以产生特别强的药水，许多类型的拉曼尼亚植被具有天生的魔法效果；暮色森林中的灌木可以自然产生（%0%）。拉曼尼亚的木材同样也有不寻常的特性，与阿伦纳的密林和青铜木如出一辙。拉曼尼亚的木材和石头可以作为原始魔法的强大焦点，用于创造（%1%），或用于召唤或束缚元素的工具。",
	"Lamannia is a source of elementals and dire beasts. It's wild and untamed, strengthening primal magic and providing a haven to lycanthropes. It resists any intrusion by civilization. Here are a few ideas for working it into your story.": "拉曼尼亚是元素和可怕的野兽的来源。它狂野而不驯服，加强了原始的魔法，为狼人提供了一个避难所。它抵制任何文明的入侵。这里有一些将其纳入你的故事的想法。",
	"When a party of adventurers unknowingly passes through a Lamannian gateway, they must find a way to survive in this wild realm. This could be as simple as finding another manifest zone to take them home, or it could require them to survive in Lamannia for months while waiting for the planes to become coterminous. Or perhaps their airship passes through a manifest zone and the elemental breaks free; the adventurers are stranded, along with other survivors.": "当一队冒险者在不知情的情况下通过拉曼尼亚的大门时，他们必须找到在这个狂野领域生存的方法。这可能很简单，就是找到另一个显化区带他们回家，也可能需要他们在拉曼尼亚生存数月，等待两个星球成为同城。也可能他们的飞艇经过了一个显现区，元素挣脱了束缚；冒险者们和其他幸存者一起被搁浅了。",
	"An island near a Lamannian manifest zone is discovered to be the home to an unusual array of megafauna beasts. Adventurers could stumble onto this on their own, or they could be hired by an heir of House Vadalis who wants to investigate the rumors without drawing the attention of rivals in the house. Perhaps the adventurers find a legendary megafauna ape—which, if captured, might break free while on exhibition and climb the towers of Sharn!": "一个靠近拉曼尼亚宣言区的岛屿被发现是一系列不寻常的巨型动物的家园。冒险家们可能是自己偶然发现的，也可能是被瓦达里斯家族的继承人雇佣的，他想在不引起家族对手注意的情况下调查这些传言。也许冒险家们会发现一只传说中的巨型动物猿--如果被捕获，它可能会在展览时挣脱出来，爬上沙恩的塔楼!",
	"An Ashbound druid manages to establish a new Lamannian manifest zone in a major city, such as Fairhaven or Sharn. It's causing the city to crumble, releasing elementals and dense vegetation as the wilderness takes over. Can the adventurers find a way to remove the manifest zone?": "一个灰界德鲁伊设法在一个主要城市建立了一个新的拉曼尼人的表现区，比如费尔海文或沙恩。它导致了城市的崩溃，释放出元素和茂密的植被，因为荒野被占领了。冒险家们能找到移除显灵区的方法吗？",
	"A sea of liquid shadows laps against black sands and basalt cliffs. A skull lies half-buried in the sand, empty sockets gazing into the roiling mist. The bone isn't sun-bleached, for there is no sun here—only a faint glimmer from the smoky gray moon that hangs in the sky.": "一片液体阴影的海洋拍打着黑沙和玄武岩悬崖。一个头骨半埋在沙子里，空洞的眼眶凝视着翻滚的雾气。骨头没有被太阳晒坏，因为这里没有太阳，只有悬挂在天空中的烟灰色月亮发出的微弱光芒。",
	"Early scholars studying reports of Mabar concluded that it was the Plane of Darkness—that this physical property is its defining concept. However, the plane's eternal gloom is just a symptom of its true nature. Even the brightest day eventually ends in darkness, and Mabar embodies this idea. It's the shadow that surrounds every island of light, patiently waiting to consume it. It's entropy, despair, and loss. This isn't the place where the souls of the living go after death, but rather, it's the plane of death itself—the hunger that consumes both light and life.": "早期研究马巴尔报告的学者得出结论，它是黑暗平面--这一物理属性是其定义概念。然而，该平面的永恒阴暗只是其真实性质的一个症状。即使是最明亮的一天最终也会在黑暗中结束，而马巴尔体现了这一理念。它是围绕着每一个光岛的阴影，耐心地等待着吞噬它。它是熵，是绝望，是损失。这不是活人死后的灵魂去的地方，而是死亡本身--吞噬光明和生命的饥饿感。",
	"Mabar is the source of negative energy, and the origin of most undead. Manifest zones—and most undead—tied to Mabar consume the life force from the world around them. However, some people maintain that negative energy itself is just a tool, and that the power of Mabar can be harnessed for good.": "玛巴尔是负能量的来源，也是大多数亡灵的起源。与马巴尔相连的显化区--以及大多数亡灵--都会消耗周围世界的生命力。然而，有些人坚持认为，负能量本身只是一种工具，马巴尔的力量可以被善加利用。",
	"The Endless Night consumes life and light. It's a wellspring of necrotic energy, where light is swallowed by gloom, and unprotected creatures quickly die. Mabar has the following universal properties.": "无尽之夜吞噬了生命和光明。它是坏死能量的泉源，光被阴暗吞噬，没有受到保护的生物很快就会死亡。马巴尔具有以下普遍属性。",
	"A creature has disadvantage on saving throws against necromancy spells. An undead creature has 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and advantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.": "一个生物在对亡灵法术的救赎上有劣势。亡灵生物的每个命中率有2个额外的命中点，对被转化或惊吓的拯救动作有优势。",
	"In order to cast a spell that deals radiant damage or restores hit points, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.": "为了施放一个造成辐射伤害或恢复命中率的法术，一个生物必须成功地进行施法能力检查，检查的DC等于10+法术的等级。如果检定失败，则该法术不会被施放，其法术槽也不会被消耗，但该动作会丢失。",
	"There is no bright light in Mabar. Any object or effect that would usually create bright light only creates dim light.": "在马巴尔没有亮光。任何通常会产生亮光的物体或效果都只会产生暗光。",
	"Mabar consumes the life force of living things. For every minute a living creature spends in Mabar, it takes 10d6 points of necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar, creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage, and creatures under the effects of a {@spell death ward} spell are immune to the effects of this property.": "Mabar会消耗生物的生命力。生物在Mabar中每呆一分钟，就会受到10d6点的坏死伤害。如果这种伤害使生物的命中率降至0，它就会立即死亡，身体碎裂成灰。马巴尔的土著，对坏死伤害有抵抗力或免疫力的生物，以及受到{@spell death ward}法术影响的生物，对这个属性的影响免疫。",
	"The planes don't usually interact with one another. The armies of Shavarath endlessly battle each other; they don't lay siege to Xoriat. Each plane is an isolated, perfect vision of a particular concept. But the concept that defines Mabar is the hunger to consume all light and life, along with the inevitable downfall of all things. When the proper forces align, Mabar pulls fragments of other planes into the Endless Night; over time, these are drained of light and hope and transformed into new layers of Mabar.": "各个星球之间通常不相互影响。沙瓦拉斯的军队无休止地相互争斗；他们不会围攻Xoriat。每个平面都是一个孤立的，对一个特定概念的完美愿景。但定义马巴尔的概念是吞噬所有光和生命的饥饿感，以及所有事物不可避免的衰落。当适当的力量结合在一起时，马巴尔将其他平面的碎片拉入无尽之夜；随着时间的推移，这些碎片被耗尽了光和希望，并转化为马巴尔的新层。",
	"Initially, these captured planar fragments become part of the Hinterlands and night falls in the region, but they don't yet have any of Mabar's universal properties. Over time, the fragment's properties from its previous plane are replaced by the properties of Mabar. Once the fragment acquires the last property in this process, the Hunger of Mabar, it's fully assimilated into the Endless Night as a new symbol of entropy and despair. Mortal inhabitants of the fragment are typically transformed into shadows or other forms of undead, while immortals might become yugoloths, or twisted into dark mockeries of their former selves. The conversion is slow and inevitable, and the Dark Powers of Mabar don't have to take any action—but regardless, most enjoy tormenting the fragments. Undead prey on the edges of fragments besieged by the Bone King, and yugoloth soldiers raid fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows.": "最初，这些被捕获的平面碎片成为腹地的一部分，夜幕降临在该地区，但它们还不具备Mabar的任何通用属性。随着时间的推移，该碎片以前所在平面的属性被Mabar的属性所取代。一旦碎片获得了这个过程中的最后一个属性，即马巴尔的饥饿，它就被完全同化到无尽之夜中，成为一个新的熵和绝望的象征。碎片中的凡人居民通常被转化为阴影或其他形式的亡灵，而不朽者则可能成为尤戈洛特，或被扭曲成以前的自我的黑暗嘲弄。这种转化是缓慢而不可避免的，马巴尔的黑暗势力不必采取任何行动--但无论如何，大多数人都喜欢折磨这些碎片。亡灵在被骨王围困的碎片边缘捕食，尤戈洛人的士兵则突袭被阴影女皇声称的碎片。",
	"As an example of a converted fragment, consider the Drifting Citadel. This floating tower was once a library in Syrania. Now it drifts through an icy void, grand windows shattered and books fallen from their shelves. Shadows of sages clutch at books with insubstantial fingers, never able to turn a page. The angelic librarians have become tormented spirits who hunger for knowledge, draining the memories from any creature unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp.": "作为一个转换碎片的例子，考虑一下漂流城堡。这座漂浮的塔楼曾经是锡拉尼亚的一座图书馆。现在它在冰冷的虚空中漂流，巨大的窗户被打碎，书本从书架上掉落。贤者的影子用没有实体的手指抓着书本，永远无法翻开一页。天使般的图书管理员已经变成了渴望知识的折磨人的灵魂，从任何不幸落入他们手中的生物身上榨取记忆。",
	"At times, the great powers of other planes have tried to stop Mabar from capturing fragments of other planes—but to no avail. The darkness can't be stopped, as it's part of the machinery of reality—the Endless Night consumes and fragments are lost. Those pulled into the darkness can fight against it, but the ultimate outcome is inevitable. Were it not for Irian, Mabar would eventually consume everything. But as the Night consumes, the Dawn restores, and so balance is ultimately maintained.": "有时，其他星球的伟大力量曾试图阻止马巴尔捕捉其他星球的碎片--但无济于事。黑暗是无法被阻止的，因为它是现实机器的一部分--无尽的黑夜在吞噬，碎片在流失。那些被拉入黑暗的人可以与之斗争，但最终的结果是不可避免的。如果没有伊里安，马巴尔最终会吞噬一切。但随着黑夜的吞噬，黎明也会恢复，因此平衡最终得以维持。",
	"The process of consumption is slow and ongoing, and there are always multiple fragments in the Hinterlands. It may take Mabar months, years, or even centuries to consume a fragment. As the properties are replaced, the landscape of the fragment changes to reflect it. In a former fragment of Lamannia, the vegetation around the borders begins to wilt. Creatures become sickly, and totems may not be seen at all, or they might be terrifying shadows, killing the grass they walk on.": "消耗的过程是缓慢而持续的，在腹地总是有多个碎片。马巴尔可能需要几个月、几年、甚至几个世纪来消耗一个碎片。随着属性的更换，碎片的景观也会发生变化以反映出来。在以前的拉曼尼亚碎片中，边界周围的植被开始枯萎。生物变得病态，图腾可能根本看不到，或者它们可能是可怕的影子，杀死它们走过的草。",
	"Mabar typically targets other planes, but it can claim pieces of the Material Plane as well. This initial effect is reminiscent of the Mourning; gray fog rolls over the region that's affected, and all that's caught within the fog is lost. However, Mabar typically claims a region the size of a town, or perhaps a county; it's never been known to claim an entire country. Typically the fog fades within a day, leaving a barren region stripped of vegetation and structures. Mabar's power is such that it also consumes the memories of the place; most mortals simply forget that the affected region ever was anything but barren, and forget the people consumed in the process. This process isn't perfect or absolute, but when contradictory information is presented, people instinctively try to rationalize it. Maybe they heard a story about the lost town? The uncle who lived in that town? Didn't he die in the war? In short, player characters might realize something is wrong, but be unable to convince others of it. Because of this magical effect and the fact that it happens so rarely, the common people of Khorvaire don't know about this aspect of Mabar. But if a group of strong-willed player characters investigates it, they might be able to discover the cause of lost colonies and other mysteries.": "玛巴尔通常以其他位面为目标，但它也可以夺取物质位面的碎片。这种最初的效果让人联想到哀伤；灰色的雾气在受影响的区域上空翻滚，所有被卷入雾气的东西都会消失。然而，马巴尔通常只对一个镇或一个县大小的地区产生影响；它从来没有对整个国家产生过影响。通常情况下，大雾会在一天内消散，留下一个没有植被和结构的荒芜地区。马巴尔的力量是这样的，它也会吞噬这个地方的记忆；大多数凡人都会忘记受影响的地区曾经是什么，除了贫瘠，也会忘记在这个过程中被吞噬的人。这个过程并不完美或绝对，但当矛盾的信息出现时，人们本能地试图将其合理化。也许他们听到了一个关于失落小镇的故事？住在那个小镇的叔叔？他不是在战争中死去了吗？简而言之，玩家角色可能会意识到有些事情是错误的，但却无法说服他人。由于这种神奇的效果以及它很少发生，霍尔韦尔的普通人并不了解马巴尔的这一方面。但是，如果一群意志坚强的玩家角色对其进行调查，他们可能会发现丢失的殖民地和其他神秘的原因。",
	"From shadows of mortal souls to Mabar's Dark Powers, the Endless Night's inhabitants all embody aspects of darkness, despair, and death. The plane's denizens fall into these five general categories.": "从凡人灵魂的影子到马巴尔的黑暗力量，无尽之夜的居民都体现了黑暗、绝望和死亡的一面。这个平面的居民可分为以下五个大类。",
	"Shadows are the most numerous inhabitants of Mabar. These semi-sentient spirits linger in places where you might expect to find people, forlornly pantomiming the roles of the absent inhabitants. You'll find the shadows of children playing on the corner of a Mabaran street, and the shadow of a priest silently praying to an absent and unknown god in a shattered temple. In his Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran asserts that every mortal has a shadow in Mabar, much like the conscripts of Shavarath; this theory is supported by the shadow-gardeners of the Amaranthine City. However, the shadows of Mabar don't speak, and they're driven by impulse and instinct; if they're tied to living creatures, they're just a dark sliver of each soul. The shadows hunger for the lifeforce of mortals, but they ignore creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage or that are shielded by the {@spell death ward} spell.": "阴影是马巴尔最多的居民。这些半知觉的灵魂在你可能期望找到人的地方徘徊，孤独地模仿着不在的居民的角色。你会发现在马巴兰街道拐角处玩耍的孩子的影子，以及在一个破碎的寺庙里向一个不存在的、未知的神灵默默祈祷的牧师的影子。在他的《星球法典》中，多里乌斯-阿莱尔-伊尔-科兰断言，每个凡人在玛巴都有一个影子，就像沙瓦拉特的征兵一样；这个理论得到了阿玛兰城的影子园长的支持。然而，马巴尔的影子不会说话，它们被冲动和本能所驱使；如果它们与活生生的生物联系在一起，它们只是每个灵魂的一个黑暗片断。阴影渴求凡人的生命力，但它们无视那些对坏死伤害有抵抗力或免疫力的生物，或被（%0%）法术屏蔽的生物。",
	"Most Mabaran shadows use the statistics for {@creature shadow||shadows} from the {@book Monster Manual|mm}, though especially strong shadows could be represented by {@creature wraith||wraiths} or {@creature specter||specters}.": "大多数马巴兰人的影子都是用{@book Monster Manual|mm}的统计数据，不过特别强的影子可以用{@creature wraith||wraiths}或{@creature specter||specters}表示。",
	"The immortals of Mabar are spirits of darkness. The yugoloths—embodiments of hunger, despair, and death—are the citizens of a vast empire centered on the Amaranthine City, most serving as soldiers. In the Hinterlands, yugoloths battle celestials and fiends trapped in these doomed fragments, until the fragments are ultimately fully drained, assimilated, and their immortal inhabitants converted to a form more suited to the Endless Night. It's questionable if these battles actually speed up the assimilation, or if they're simply a way for the yugoloths to pass the time. If there are no immortals to battle, the yugoloths simply spread despair; an oinoloth may spread plague through a fragment of the Material Plane, then spend a year watching the result.": "马巴尔的不朽者是黑暗的精神。尤格洛斯--饥饿、绝望和死亡的化身--是以阿玛兰斯城为中心的庞大帝国的公民，大多数人担任士兵。在腹地，尤戈洛斯与被困在这些注定要毁灭的碎片中的天人和魔鬼作战，直到这些碎片最终被完全耗尽，被同化，其不朽的居民被转化为更适合无尽之夜的形式。令人怀疑的是，这些战斗是否真的加快了同化的速度，或者它们只是尤戈洛人打发时间的一种方式。如果没有不朽者可以战斗，尤戈洛人就会简单地散播绝望；一个奥诺洛人可能会在物质世界的一个碎片中散播瘟疫，然后花一年时间来观察结果。",
	"Some yugoloths are gardeners, but what they cultivate are shadows. By shaping a mortal's shadow, a fiend can fill that mortal with despair or drive them down dark paths. When the associated mortal eventually dies, the yugoloth can refine that shadow into quintessence; this substance is crafted by yugoloth artists and artisans into tools and weapons that can cause death and despair, should they make their way to the mortal world. While most gardeners work with shadows, some go into the fragments of the Hinterlands to directly torment the hostages in slow and subtle ways. Other yugoloths are philosophers and oracles who contemplate the nature of entropy and the way in which all things will end. And some serve menial roles in the Amaranthine City.": "有些尤格罗人是园丁，但他们培养的是阴影。通过塑造一个凡人的影子，恶魔可以让这个凡人充满绝望，或者把他们赶到黑暗的道路上。当相关的凡人最终死亡时，尤戈洛人可以将影子提炼成精髓；这种物质被尤戈洛人的艺术家和工匠制作成工具和武器，如果它们进入凡人世界，可以导致死亡和绝望。虽然大多数园丁与阴影打交道，但有些人进入腹地的碎片中，以缓慢而微妙的方式直接折磨人质。其他的玉格拉斯是哲学家和神谕者，他们思考着熵的本质和所有事物的终结方式。还有一些在亚马逊之城担任琐碎的角色。",
	"The yugoloths make up the majority of the immortals of Mabar, but there are others. Mabaran incubi and succubi embody emotional pain and loss. Some prey on hostages in fragments, while others live alongside the yugoloths and ply their wiles on them; the suffering of a fiend is just as satisfying to them as that of a mortal. Other incubi and succubi are gardeners, and some believe that these can drain the love from a mortal heart by bleeding it from their shadow. There are also immortals from other fragments that have been transformed—angels and devils reshaped by the Endless Night.": "尤戈洛人构成了马巴的大多数不朽者，但也有其他的。马巴兰的妖怪和女妖体现了情感上的痛苦和损失。一些人在碎片中捕食人质，而另一些人则与尤戈洛人生活在一起，对他们施展诡计；对他们来说，恶魔的痛苦与凡人的痛苦一样令人满意。其他的incubi和succubi是园丁，有些人相信这些人可以通过从他们的影子里放血来吸干凡人心中的爱。还有一些来自其他碎片的不朽者，他们已经被改造了--天使和魔鬼被无尽的黑夜重新塑造。",
	"Mabar is the origin of most undead. Sentient undead are created when a dying creature's soul is bound to Mabar instead of passing to Dolurrh. The energy of Mabar sustains the creature—be it wraith, mummy, or vampire—while the creature serves as a conduit to the Endless Night. This is why many undead directly consume the life force of other creatures. Even those who don't do so directly may drain life from the world simply by existing; this is why plants are often withered in areas frequented by the undead. Likewise, this connection to Mabar has a corrupting effect that pulls most intelligent undead toward evil alignments. Even people who were good in life find that Mabar erodes their empathy and compassion; it's a struggle to maintain your humanity when your existence is bound to the Endless Night.": "马巴尔是大多数亡灵的起源。当一个濒临死亡的生物的灵魂被束缚在马巴尔上，而不是转移到多鲁尔时，就会产生有知觉的亡灵。马巴尔的能量维持着这个生物--无论是巫师、木乃伊还是吸血鬼--而这个生物则是通往无尽之夜的通道。这就是为什么许多亡灵直接吞噬其他生物的生命力。即使那些不直接这样做的人，也可能仅仅因为存在而耗尽世界的生命；这就是为什么在亡灵经常出没的地方，植物往往会枯萎。同样地，这种与马巴尔的联系具有腐蚀作用，将大多数聪明的亡灵拉向邪恶的方向。即使是生前善良的人也会发现玛巴尔侵蚀了他们的同情心和怜悯心；当你的存在被无尽之夜束缚时，要保持你的人性是很困难的。",
	"There are also many undead in Mabar itself. Many of these are merely symbolic manifestations of Mabar, not actually the remains of mortal beings; the endless skeletal armies of the Bone King are manifestations and the Bone King himself was likely never mortal. Specters and wraiths are especially powerful shadows; some are the work of gardeners, while others emerge from the pure darkness of Mabar. The more desolate planes, like the Obsidian Desert, are ruled by nightwalkers, powerful conduits of negative energy; they often attack fragments, feeding on the energy of the fragment and accelerating its assimilation.": "在马巴尔本身也有许多亡灵。其中许多只是马巴尔的象征性表现，实际上并不是凡人的遗体；骨王的无尽骷髅军团就是表现，而骨王本人很可能从来不是凡人。幽灵和裹尸人是特别强大的影子；有些是园丁的杰作，而有些则是从玛巴尔的纯粹黑暗中出现的。更荒凉的星球，如黑曜石沙漠，由夜行者统治，他们是强大的负能量通道；他们经常攻击碎片，以碎片的能量为食，加速碎片的同化。",
	"Beyond this, the souls of sentient undead are bound to Mabar. When a vampire, mummy, lich, or similar creature is physically destroyed, it doesn't get the release of Dolurrh; instead, the soul becomes a wraith in Mabar, forever driven by the hunger of the Endless Night. Most are driven mad by this process, but perhaps the adventurers might once again encounter a vampire they previously killed, now a spectral lord in the Endless Night.": "除此之外，有生命的亡灵的灵魂也被束缚在Mabar。当一个吸血鬼、木乃伊、巫师或类似的生物被消灭后，它并没有得到Dolurrh的释放；相反，它的灵魂变成了Mabar的一个包裹，永远被无尽黑夜的饥渴所驱使。大多数人在这个过程中被逼疯了，但也许冒险者会再次遇到他们之前杀死的吸血鬼，现在他是无尽之夜中的幽灵领主。",
	"The mightiest and most malevolent beings in Mabar are known as the Dark Powers. Each embodies a particular aspect of Mabar and rules a domain of linked layers. Some have been part of Mabar since the beginning of time, while others have risen from the fragments consumed by the Endless Night. Most of the Dark Powers are equivalent in power to archfey or archfiends, though they're even stronger in the layer they're bound to, their seat of power. However, they have a limited ability to act beyond Mabar, and can only affect the Material Plane through warlocks or undead servants. Three of the Dark Powers that are known on Eberron are described later in this section, but there are many more in the shadows.": "马巴尔最强大和最邪恶的生命被称为黑暗势力。每个人都体现了马巴尔的一个特定方面，并统治着一个层层相连的领域。有些从时间之初就已经是玛巴尔的一部分，而有些则是从被无尽之夜吞噬的碎片中崛起的。大多数黑暗势力的力量等同于大帝或大恶魔，尽管他们在他们被束缚的那一层，即他们的权力所在地更加强大。然而，他们在玛巴尔之外的行动能力有限，只能通过术士或亡灵仆人影响物质世界。本节后面将介绍Eberron上已知的三种黑暗力量，但还有更多的黑暗力量在暗处。",
	"he fragments in the Hinterlands hold all the creatures that dwelled in each before they were captured. When a mortal dies there, they return as a shadow or undead. Immortals are bound to their fragment; they can't leave it, and if they die, they're reborn there. So creatures from any plane could be found here, including the Material Plane. A chunk of Risia might hold frost giants. A fragment of the Endless Ocean might have a pod of merfolk. But the longer they remain in Mabar, the more the plane corrupts the fragment and the creatures in it, until they become shadows, undead, or something worse. A mortal creature that lives through this process may have all the light drained from its soul or be consumed by despair. While it might retain its original appearance, it should be considered an aberration; in the end, it will seek to spread misery and extinguish both light and life.": "腹地的碎片保存着所有在被俘之前居住在其中的生物。当一个凡人死在那里，他们会以影子或不死之身返回。不朽者被束缚在他们的碎片中；他们不能离开它，如果他们死了，他们会在那里重生。所以任何位面的生物都能在这里找到，包括物质位面。里西亚（Risia）的一块碎片可能容纳冰霜巨人。无尽之海的一块碎片可能会有一窝人鱼。但他们在玛巴尔停留的时间越长，这个位面就越能腐蚀这个碎片和其中的生物，直到他们变成阴影、亡灵，或者更糟糕的东西。经历过这个过程的凡人生物可能会被抽走灵魂中所有的光，或者被绝望吞噬。虽然它可能会保留其原来的外观，但应该被视为一种畸形；最终，它将寻求传播痛苦，并熄灭光明和生命。",
	"It's always night in Mabar, and its shadowy moon, Sypheros, remains fixed in the sky. While the setting varies across its countless layers—a desert, a ruined city, the withered remains of fertile farmland—the story is always about loss, entropy, despair, and death. A layer might contain a massive battlefield filled with the intertwined bones of dragons and giants. Ossuaries and catacombs. Crumbling memorials, with names too faded to read. Barren orchards and dried riverbeds. And tombs, from tiny unmarked crypts to the death-palaces of fallen rulers, necropolises filled with traps and treasures. And this being the Endless Night, some of those dead rulers still dominate their domains, whether they take the form of undead or simply malevolent will.": "马巴尔的夜晚永远都是这样，它那朦胧的月亮，Sypheros，仍然固定在天空中。虽然其无数层的背景各不相同--沙漠、废墟、肥沃农田的枯萎，但故事总是关于损失、熵、绝望和死亡。一层可能包含一个巨大的战场，里面充满了龙和巨人的交织的骨头。尸骨库和地下墓穴。摇摇欲坠的纪念碑，上面的名字已经褪色，无法阅读。荒芜的果园和干涸的河床。还有坟墓，从没有标记的小墓穴到堕落统治者的死亡宫殿，充满陷阱和宝藏的墓地。由于是无尽的黑夜，这些死去的统治者中的一些人仍在统治着他们的领地，无论他们是以亡灵的形式出现，还是仅仅以恶意的意志出现。",
	"Layers are linked in domains, and each one is bound to one of the Dark Powers. The denizens of the layers and the overall themes reflect the influence of that Dark Power, so layers in the Kingdom of Bones are largely inhabited by undead, while yugoloths dwell in layers bound to the Amaranthine City. Some layers are bounded by physical barriers, but most either loop back on themselves or end in walls of fog—not unlike the dead-gray mists of the Mournland—and any who wander into the mists reemerge elsewhere in the layer. Within domains, layers are often connected by physical portals—perhaps a massive gate or a pool of shadows. Moving between domains requires plane shift or performing a ritual tied to that domain. These rituals need not be magical; they're simply secrets that have to be learned. If you're in the Kingdom of Bones and you want to get to the domain of the Queen of All Tears, the answer is simple: All you have to do is sincerely cry, and your tears will take you there.": "各层在领域中相互联系，每一层都与黑暗势力之一有关。各层的居民和整体主题反映了黑暗势力的影响，因此白骨王国的各层主要由亡灵居住，而尤戈洛特人则居住在与阿玛兰斯城相连的各层。有些层以物理屏障为界，但大多数层要么回环往复，要么在雾墙中结束--与哀伤之地的死灰色迷雾不一样--任何误入迷雾的人都会在该层的其他地方出现。在领域内，各层通常由物理门户连接--也许是一个巨大的门或一个影子池。在域之间移动需要进行平面转换，或者进行与该域相关的仪式。这些仪式不需要有魔法；它们只是必须要学习的秘密。如果你在骨头王国，而你想去所有眼泪女王的领域，答案很简单。你所要做的就是真诚地哭泣，你的眼泪会带你到那里。",
	"Here are three examples of Mabar's domains, each of which could hold many layers..": "这里有三个马巴尔领域的例子，每个领域都可以容纳很多层。",
	"The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Mabar. Experienced planar travelers may find it familiar, for it's a dark reflection of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Irian shows the city in its first days of glory: prosperous, clean, full of joy and life. The Amaranthine City of Mabar is a haunted shadow of this glory. Like its counterpart, this immense metropolis fills an entire layer, but here, its banners are faded and torn, walls are cracked, and fountains are dry. Shadows still move through the streets, a miserable reminder of the crowds that once filled the city. The rotting tapestries and chipped mosaics speak of a past age of wonders and glory. The two are unmistakably the same city, both in architectural style and the layout of its streets. This feels like the last days of a grand empire, an image of decaying grandeur; but there's great power beneath the tragic façade. The walls may be cracked, but they are still mighty, and the mezzoloth's rusty trident can kill you as easily as a polished one.": "阿玛兰斯城被广泛认为是马巴尔的中心。有经验的平面旅行者可能会发现它很熟悉，因为它是伊里安的阿玛兰丁城的黑暗反映。伊里安展示了这个城市最初的辉煌：繁荣、清洁、充满欢乐和生命。马巴尔的阿玛兰丁城是这一荣耀的鬼影。就像它的对应物一样，这个巨大的大都市充满了整个楼层，但在这里，它的横幅已经褪色和破损，墙壁开裂，喷泉干涸。阴影仍然在街道上移动，悲惨地提醒着人们曾经充满了这座城市的人群。腐烂的挂毯和剥落的马赛克讲述着过去那个充满奇迹和荣耀的时代。无论是建筑风格还是街道布局，这两座城市都毫不含糊地是同一个城市。这感觉就像一个大帝国的最后日子，一个衰败的宏伟形象；但在悲剧性的外表下，却有巨大的力量。城墙可能已经开裂，但它们仍然很强大，梅索罗斯生锈的三叉戟可以像抛光的三叉戟一样轻易地杀死你。",
	"The city's ruler, the Empress of Shadows, is the first and greatest of the Dark Powers. Her defining principle is hunger, the desire to consume all that is light, to expand her empire across eternity. She prefers an elegant fiendish form, with polished horns and chitin plates engraved with arcane sigils, but she can take the shape of any yugoloth. She spends much of her time presiding over the decaying pomp and grandeur of the Amaranthine City, but also closely monitors the campaigns in the Hinterlands and occasionally takes time to torment her hostages. The sages of Syrania believe that the Empress of Shadows chooses which fragments of other planes will be pulled into Mabar, and planar emissaries sometimes dwell in the Amaranthine City seeking to negotiate with her.": "这个城市的统治者，阴影女皇，是第一个也是最伟大的黑暗势力。她的决定性原则是饥饿，渴望吞噬所有的光明，将她的帝国扩展到永恒。她更喜欢优雅的恶魔形态，有抛光的角和刻有奥术符号的甲壳板，但她可以变成任何尤戈洛人的形状。她大部分时间都在主持阿玛兰斯城的衰败盛况，但也密切关注着腹地的战役，偶尔也会抽出时间来折磨她的人质。西拉尼亚的圣人相信，阴影女皇会选择哪些其他星球的碎片被拉入玛巴尔，而星球的使者有时会居住在阿玛兰斯城，寻求与她进行谈判。",
	"This city is the seat of the yugoloths; for every yugoloth in the Amaranthine City of Mabar, there is an angel in the city in Irian, all the way up to the Dawn Empress and the Empress of Shadows. Most likely, this is just a way of reflecting the planes' core concepts—beginnings and endings, hope and despair. But it's possible that Irian and Mabar are somehow the same—perhaps the Dawn Empress is the Empress of Shadows, and though they appear to exist at the same time, they reflect the beginning and end of the same spirit.": "这座城市是yugoloths的所在地；每一个Amaranthine马巴尔城的yugoloth，都有一个伊里安城的天使，一直到黎明女皇和阴影女皇。最有可能的是，这只是反映各星球的核心概念--开始和结束、希望和绝望的一种方式。但也有可能伊里安和马巴尔在某种程度上是相同的--也许黎明皇后就是阴影皇后，虽然他们看起来是同时存在的，但他们反映的是同一个精神的开始和结束。",
	"The layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of imperial ambition and decaying power. Some embody desperation—a collapsing fortress awaiting an assault that will surely destroy it, or an abandoned sanitarium whose inmates are trapped and starving. These regions are inhabited by shadows, but the fiendish gardeners can instill near-sentience into them if it serves their purposes. Fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows are drawn into her empire, and usually acquire a yugoloth outpost even as the life is drained from the region.": "与亚马逊之城相连的各层反映了其帝国野心和衰败的权力的主题。有些体现了绝望--一个正在坍塌的堡垒等待着一场必将摧毁它的攻击，或者一个被遗弃的疗养院，里面的人被困在那里，饥肠辘辘。这些地区居住着阴影，但邪恶的园丁可以向他们灌输近乎有意识的东西，如果这符合他们的目的。阴影女皇声称的碎片被吸引到她的帝国中，并且通常在该地区的生命被耗尽时获得一个尤格罗特的前哨。",
	"Where the domain of the Amaranthine City feels like an empire in its last days, the Kingdom of Bones is one that's already fallen. If a layer contains a fortress, it's not preparing for a final battle; it's what remained after the battle. The gates are shattered, and bloodstains and broken weapons are scattered across the floors. The people of this domain fought a dreadful war and lost... but this being Mabar, their bones remain. The skeletons of peasants continue their menial labors, seemingly oblivious to the futility of their actions. Even in death, these commoners are oppressed by their cruel lords. Wights, deathlocks, and vampire spawn might serve as the soldiers of the tyrants, while the overlords themselves may be vampires or mummy lords, still ruling from their ruined keeps.": "阿马兰斯城的领地给人的感觉是一个处于最后时期的帝国，而白骨王国则是一个已经沦陷的王国。如果一个楼层包含一个堡垒，它不是在为最后的战斗做准备；它是战斗后留下的东西。大门被击碎，血迹和破碎的武器散落在地板上。这个领地的人民进行了一场可怕的战争，并且输了......但这里是马巴尔，他们的骨头还在。农民的骸骨继续着他们的琐碎劳动，似乎对他们的行为的无用性视而不见。即使在死后，这些平民也被他们残忍的领主压迫着。骑士、死囚和吸血鬼的后代可能会成为暴君的士兵，而霸主本身可能是吸血鬼或木乃伊领主，仍然在他们的废墟上统治。",
	"All of the kingdom's cursed nobles bow before the Bone King, who embodies the concepts of death and decay. A lich in rotting finery, he stands as a warning that even the mightiest lords eventually become dust and bone. He prefers to drain the life slowly from fragments he claims; he wants his hostages to dwell on their coming death while their land withers around them, for lords to turn on their people before he finally kills them all.": "王国所有被诅咒的贵族都在骨王面前鞠躬，他体现了死亡和腐烂的概念。他是一个穿着腐烂衣服的巫师，他代表着一个警告，即使是最强大的领主最终也会变成灰尘和骨头。他更喜欢从他索取的碎片中慢慢榨取生命；他希望他的人质沉浸在即将到来的死亡中，而他们的土地在他们周围枯萎，在他最终将他们全部杀死之前，领主们会背叛他们的人民。",
	"The Bone King's statistics could be represented using Orcus as a foundation. He can serve as an Undying patron for warlocks, and is known to teach mortal wizards the foul rituals that allow ascension to lichdom. To all who serve him in this way, he grants titles in his kingdom—and the knowledge that when they die, they'll be forever bound to serve in it. He makes few demands of these servants; they feed him whenever they use the powers he grants to slay the living. But a warlock may be tasked to destroy a lich or vampire—or even another warlock—because the Bone King desires them to serve in his kingdom.": "骨王的统计数据可以用奥库斯作为基础来表示。他可以作为术士的不死守护者，并且众所周知，他可以教凡人的巫师进行肮脏的仪式，让他们升入巫师之境。对于所有以这种方式为他服务的人，他都会授予他们王国的头衔，并且知道当他们死后，他们将永远被束缚在王国中服务。他对这些仆人的要求不多；只要他们使用他授予的力量杀死活人，他们就能养活他。但一个术士可能会被派去消灭一个巫师或吸血鬼，甚至是另一个术士，因为骨王希望他们在他的王国里服务。",
	"A desert of black sand under a starless sky—this is one of Mabar's iconic images. In the Last Desert, there are remnants of glorious monuments: the half-buried head of a grand statue, its eye cracked; a fragment of a memorial wall, engraved with names that can no longer be read; ruins so worn that it's impossible to guess what purpose the building once served. Characters proficient in History and Arcana can recognize that these monuments are drawn from dramatically different cultures; some are the work of celestials, while others might have been created by the giants of Xen'drik.": "无星的天空下，一片黑沙的沙漠--这是马巴尔的标志性图像之一。在最后的沙漠中，有一些光荣的纪念碑的遗迹：半埋的大雕像的头，它的眼睛裂开了；纪念墙的碎片，刻着已经无法读懂的名字；废墟如此破旧，以至于无法猜测建筑曾经的用途。精通历史和奥术的人物可以认识到，这些纪念碑来自截然不同的文化；有些是天人的作品，而有些则可能是由Xen'drik的巨人创造的。",
	"At the center lies a massive tomb-palace. Its style suggests the architecture of Aerenal, but it's grander than even the City of the Dead. This is the fortress of the Queen of All Tears, the Dark Power of this domain. The Queen is an embodiment of misery, and her subjects are largely incorporeal undead, shadows and wraiths from the barren sand. Meanwhile, cruel specters and banshees attend the Queen, along with succubi and incubi who bask in the delicious misery that suffuses the region. The Queen herself takes the form of a mummified corpse, enshrouded by a spectral image of a beautiful elf woman. The suffering of others is her mead, and her only pleasure is the slow torment of the hostages in her Hinterland fragments.": "在中心位置有一个巨大的坟墓宫殿。它的风格暗示着艾瑞纳的建筑，但它甚至比死亡之城还要宏伟。这是所有眼泪女王的堡垒，这个领域的黑暗力量。女王是痛苦的化身，她的臣民大多是无体的亡灵，来自荒芜沙地的影子和裹尸者。同时，残酷的幽灵和女妖也在追随女王，还有那些沉浸在弥漫在这个地区的美味苦难中的魅魔和妖怪。女王本人以木乃伊尸体的形式出现，被一个美丽的精灵女子的幽灵形象所笼罩。其他人的痛苦就是她的蜂蜜酒，她唯一的乐趣就是在她的腹地碎片中慢慢折磨人质。",
	"The Queen of All Tears is one of the youngest of the Dark Powers. She was once a mortal who dreamed of mastering life and death, but her pursuit of these goals resulted in the deaths of everyone she ever loved and everyone who shared her blood. Her kingdom was razed, and she killed her own daughter and transformed her into a lich, so at least one piece of her legacy might survive. Her name was Minara Vol, and she was the mother of Erandis Vol. In the process of becoming a Dark Power, she's lost much of her own identity and sense of her past. She despises both elves and dragons, but has forgotten even her own daughter. If the Queen were to somehow regain her memories, she might seek to strike at the Undying Court and Argonnessen, or to aid Erandis—or it may be that she continues to dwell in her despair and ignore her past.": "所有眼泪的女王是最年轻的黑暗势力之一。她曾经是一个梦想掌握生命和死亡的凡人，但她对这些目标的追求导致了她所爱的每个人和每个与她有共同血缘关系的人的死亡。她的王国被夷为平地，她杀死了自己的女儿，并把她变成了一个巫师，因此她的遗产中至少有一块可能幸存下来。她的名字叫米娜拉-沃尔，她是埃兰迪斯-沃尔的母亲。在成为黑暗势力的过程中，她已经失去了很多自己的身份和对自己过去的感觉。她既看不起精灵，也看不起龙，但甚至连自己的女儿都忘记了。如果女王以某种方式恢复了记忆，她可能会寻求对不死阁和阿贡纳森的打击，或者帮助艾兰迪斯，或者她可能会继续沉浸在绝望中，忽略自己的过去。",
	"The Queen's layers are largely desolate and miserable, filled with wailing wraiths and banshees. One is a battlefield plucked from Aerenal, where the bones of elves and dragons lie intertwined; this may hold the key to discovering her past.": "女王的层级基本上都是荒凉和悲惨的，充满了哀嚎的巫师和女妖。其中有一个从Aerenal拔出的战场，那里有精灵和龙的骨头交织在一起；这可能是发现她的过去的关键。",
	"The Hinterlands are the outer edge of Mabar, the collection of planar fragments that are currently being consumed and integrated into the Endless Night. Here, the Hunger of Mabar property has not yet taken hold, which generally makes them safer to visit than other layers of Mabar. The Mabaran properties a fragment reflects vary depending on its nature and how close it is to complete integration with Mabar.": "腹地是马巴尔的外围，是目前正在被吞噬并融入无尽之夜的平面碎片的集合。在这里，马巴尔财产的饥饿感还没有形成，这通常使他们比马巴尔的其他层更安全地访问。一个碎片所反映的马巴兰属性取决于它的性质和它与马巴尔完全融合的程度。",
	"There can be infinite variety in the fragments within the Hinterlands. This largely depends on what plane a fragment is from. Is it a verdant forest of Lamannia? A floating tower of Syrania? Or is it a piece of the Material Plane—a fortress plucked out of the Last War or a Riedran village? The second question is how long the fragment has been under siege. To what degree does it retain its original flavor, and how much has the influence of Mabar oventaken it? The final question is which of the Dark Powers has claimed it—and why? What is it about this region that draws it towards a Dark Power's domain? The Empress of Shadows looks for places that shine too brightly—places that bask in their achievements, sure their glory will never fade. The Bone King claims fragments where commoners suffer or where rulers turn to tyranny; there are a few Karrnathi fragments in his domain, though it can be hard to tell how close they are to being subsumed. The Queen of All Tears seeks the places where terrible tragedies have occurred, forcing the inhabitants to forever dwell in these moments of misery. With fragments of the outer planes, it's more a question of reshaping the plance to fit these stories. By contrast, when it comes to the Material Plane, it's the story itself that often draws the dire hand of Mabar.": "腹地内的碎片可以有无限的多样性。这主要取决于碎片来自哪个平面。它是拉曼尼亚的青翠森林？西拉尼亚的浮动塔？还是物质世界的碎片--从最后战争中拔出的堡垒或里德兰村落？第二个问题是这个碎片被围困了多长时间。它在多大程度上保留了其原有的风味，而马巴尔的影响又在多大程度上侵袭了它？最后一个问题是，哪个黑暗势力声称拥有它--为什么？这个地区是什么吸引了它走向黑暗势力的领域？阴影女皇寻找的是那些光芒四射的地方--那些沉浸在自己的成就中，确信自己的荣耀永不褪色的地方。骨王要求寻找那些平民受苦或统治者转向暴政的地方；在他的领域里有一些卡尔纳提的碎片，尽管很难说它们有多接近被吞并。所有眼泪的女王寻找那些发生过可怕悲剧的地方，迫使居民永远沉浸在这些痛苦的时刻。对于外部星球的碎片，这更像是一个重塑羽翼以适应这些故事的问题。相比之下，当涉及到物质世界时，往往是故事本身吸引了马巴尔的可怕之手。",
	"Here are a few ways Mabar can influence the Material Plane.": "以下是马巴尔影响物质世界的几种方式。",
	"Mabaran manifest zones are infamous and almost universally shunned, for nearly all are harmful to the flora and fauna of the region. In some zones, life withers and dies. In others, it's twisted in strange ways; plants may seek the blood of living creatures, or grow unnaturally pale and cold. Rot and decay are often accelerated, and disease can thrive. However, such regions are also often powerful sources of negative energy. Mabaran zones often possess the Necrotic Power universal property, and there are epic rituals and eldritch machines that require a Mabaran manifest zone. The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. {@i In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy}, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns—which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.": "马巴兰宣言区声名狼藉，几乎人人避之不及，因为几乎所有的宣言区都对该地区的动植物有害。在某些区域，生命会枯萎和死亡。在其他区域，生命以奇怪的方式被扭曲；植物可能会寻找生物的血液，或变得异常苍白和寒冷。腐烂和腐朽往往加速，疾病可能兴旺。然而，这些地区往往也是强大的负能量来源。马巴兰区通常拥有Necrotic Power的普遍属性，有一些史诗般的仪式和长生机需要马巴兰显化区。创造卡尔纳提亡灵的奥达克尔仪式就是一个例子，而卡尔纳提的阿图尔城就建在马巴兰区。这往往有一个奇怪的协同作用：如果马巴兰显化区的负能量经常被引导到仪式或法术中，就能防止这种能量传播疾病或杀死植被。{@i In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy}，乔兰-哈斯-霍兰断言，战争初期卡尔纳特遭受的瘟疫和饥荒是由于通常照料这些区域的探索者出于战略考虑而被赶出这些区域--这反过来又迫使卡尔纳特接受死灵法术来对抗那些饥荒的影响。",
	"While Mabaran manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, they are powerful sources of negative energy and produce undead. Skeletons, zombies, and ghouls can all spontaneously rise in Mabaran manifest zones, and more powerful undead can be created under the proper circumstances.": "虽然马巴兰显灵区很少作为通往位面的通道，但它们是强大的负能量来源，并能产生亡灵。骷髅、僵尸和食尸鬼都可以在马巴兰显灵区自发地崛起，在适当的情况下还可以创造出更强大的亡灵。",
	"On nights when Mabar is coterminous, the Necrotic Power property encompasses the entire world, and the radius of all light sources are halved. During these periods, regions of deepest darkness can serve as gateways to Mabar, releasing shadows or other foul things into the world. This primarily occurs in regions that are suffused with despair or misery, and only at night, ending as soon as dawn breaks. As a result, during coterminous periods, friends and family usually huddle together indoors, keeping the lights burning and telling cheerful tales.": "在Mabar共存的夜晚，Necrotic Power属性涵盖了整个世界，所有光源的半径都减半。在这些时期，最深的黑暗区域可以作为通往Mabar的通道，将阴影或其他肮脏的东西释放到这个世界。这主要发生在充斥着绝望或痛苦的地区，而且只在夜间发生，在黎明时分就结束。因此，在同时期，朋友和家人通常在室内挤在一起，保持灯火通明，讲述欢快的故事。",
	"When Mabar is remote, all creatures have resistance to necrotic damage, and undead have disadvantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.": "当马巴尔在远处时，所有的生物都对坏死的伤害有抵抗力，而亡灵对被转化或被惊吓的救赎有不利的一面。",
	"Traditionally, Mabar is coterminous for three nights in the month of Vult—the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice. The people of the Five Nations call this time Long Shadows. Mabar is remote less frequently, for a period of five days around the summer solstice, but only once every five years.": "传统上，马巴尔与伏尔特月的三个晚上是相通的--最接近冬至的新月之夜。五族人民称这段时间为长影。Mabar偏僻的频率较低，在夏至前后有五天的时间，但每五年只有一次。",
	"Mabaran artifacts are formed from quintessence, the solidified energy of Mabaran shadows. This matte black substance can be used in a similar way to wood, metal, or cloth. Quintessence items are powerful conduits for necromancy and necrotic energy; a {@item staff of withering}, {@item sword of wounding}, or {@item sword of life stealing} might be made from Mabaran quintessence. Items that create undead or consume light might also be crafted from quintessence; such items drain joy and empathy from those that carry them, and those who wield such items often become cold and cruel. Yugoloth artisans can create unique items with even greater powers, but the purpose of these tools is to spread despair and misery. Some drain Hit Dice from their wielders to pay for their deadly abilities; others cause the bearer to rise as an undead creature after death.": "马巴兰的工艺品是由精髓形成的，是马巴兰影子的凝固能量。这种哑光的黑色物质可以以类似于木材、金属或布的方式使用。精髓物品是亡灵魔法和亡灵能量的强大通道；{@item staff of withering}、{@item sword of wounding}或{@item sword of life stealing}可能是由马巴兰精髓制成。创造亡灵或消耗光的物品也可能是由精髓制作的；这种物品会消耗携带者的快乐和同情心，挥舞这种物品的人往往会变得冷酷和残忍。Yugoloth工匠可以创造出具有更大力量的独特物品，但这些工具的目的是为了传播绝望和痛苦。有些物品会消耗持有者的命中率，以支付其致命的能力；有些物品会使持有者在死后变成不死生物。",
	"The most powerful Mabaran artifacts are battleloths—yugoloths that have allowed themselves to be forged into objects to spread death and despair. These are intelligent and powerful, but drive their wielders down dark paths.": "最强大的马巴兰神器是战神--允许自己被锻造成传播死亡和绝望的物品的尤戈洛人。这些都是聪明而强大的，但却把它们的施用者推向了黑暗的道路。",
	"When plants do grow in Mabaran manifest zones, they're often poisonous; bloodvine can produce a variety of deadly venoms. However, the elves of the Bloodsail Principality have mastered the art of gardening in Mabaran zones, and there, you can find wondrous plants that feed on shadows instead of sunlight—darkwood trees, ebon sedge grass, and more. Here, they produce spices and wines unlike any others in the world.": "当植物确实生长在马巴兰表现区时，它们往往是有毒的；血藤可以产生各种致命的毒液。然而，血帆公国的精灵们已经掌握了在马巴兰地区进行园艺的艺术，在那里，你可以找到奇妙的植物，它们以阴影而不是阳光为食--黑檀树、黑檀草，以及其他。在这里，他们生产的香料和葡萄酒与世界上任何其他地方都不同。",
	"Mabar inspires cruelty and despair. Its necrotic energies can be a general environmental threat or harnessed as a weapon by warlocks or necromancers. Here are some stories you might explore about this plane.": "马巴尔激发了残忍和绝望。它的坏死能量可以是一种普遍的环境威胁，也可以被术士或死灵法师作为武器来利用。这里有一些你可以探索的关于这个平面的故事。",
	"It's unlikely that the Mourning was caused by Mabar. The effect is much larger than any fragment, the lingering strangeness doesn't resemble Mabar, and people know it's been destroyed, unlike with most fragments. However, it's entirely possible that part of Cyre could have been claimed by Mabar as the Mourning unfolded—perhaps Metrol still exists in the Hinterlands of Mabar! If so, is there any chance it could be saved? Is Queen Dannel alive? Or could she have somehow been responsible, sacrificing her own people to become one of the Dark Powers herself?": "悼念活动不太可能是由马巴尔引起的。它的影响比任何碎片都要大得多，挥之不去的怪异感并不像马巴尔，而且人们知道它已经被摧毁了，与大多数碎片不同。然而，Cyre的一部分完全有可能在哀悼展开时被Mabar认领--也许Metrol仍然存在于Mabar的腹地! 如果是这样，有没有可能被拯救？丹妮尔女王还活着吗？或者她会不会以某种方式负责，牺牲自己的人民，自己成为黑暗势力的一员？",
	"While passing across a moor, the adventurers are set upon by the shadows of wolves and hawks. The following dawn, they discover that one of the characters is missing their shadow; it's been lost in the manifest zone. Do they need to go back and find it? If so, how? If not, what does it mean that this character no longer has a shadow?": "在经过一片荒野时，冒险家们被狼和鹰的影子袭击。第二天黎明，他们发现其中一个角色的影子不见了；它在显露区丢失了。他们需要回去找到它吗？如果是的话，怎么找？如果不需要，这个人物不再有影子意味着什么？",
	"A cruel warlock holds a small village in his grip. When the adventurers defeat the villain, they make an unpleasant discovery: the village of Shadholt is in a Mabaran manifest zone, and while the warlock was a villain, his rituals also prevented the zone from spreading plagues throughout the entire region. Can the adventurers help one of the villagers take the warlock's place, forging the pact and gaining the powers needed to contain the threat? What Dark Power must they deal with?": "一个残忍的术士将一个小村庄牢牢地控制在手中。当冒险家们打败了这个恶棍后，他们有了一个不愉快的发现：沙德霍尔特村位于马巴兰人的显灵区，虽然术士是个恶棍，但他的仪式也阻止了该区在整个地区的瘟疫蔓延。冒险家们能否帮助其中一个村民取代术士的位置，缔结契约并获得遏制威胁所需的力量？他们必须对付的是什么黑暗力量？",

	"Risia is known as the Plain of Ice, for that's the vast majority of what's found within it. Risia is defined by endless arctic wastes, and what appear to be mountains are just peaks of solid ice. But like Fernia, Risia's appearance can be deceiving. Because it's filled with glaciers and snow, many sages assume that this is its defining principle. But in Lamannia, there are also endless blizzards and majestic glaciers—ice in its natural state. By comparison, the core ideas that define Risia are isolation, stagnation, and preservation. The endless frozen plane isn't about snow, it's about the utter stillness, the empty and unchanging landscape. Risia is sparsely populated, because that's the point of it; it's bleak and lonely, a realm in which you could walk for days and never see another creature. Where a desert of sand can at least shift in the breeze, the frozen landscape of Risia is unchanging. Yet, unlike a stone plateau, it reflects a substance that could change at one point—but is now caught, frozen, stagnant.": "里西亚被称为 \"冰原\"，因为这是它的绝大部分内容。里西亚被定义为无尽的北极荒原，而那些看起来是山的地方只是固体冰的山峰。但和费尔尼亚一样，里西亚的外表也是骗人的。因为它充满了冰川和雪，许多圣人认为这是它的决定性原则。但在拉曼尼亚，也有无尽的暴风雪和雄伟的冰川--自然状态下的冰。相比之下，定义里西亚的核心思想是隔离、停滞和保存。无尽的冰面不是指雪，而是指彻底的静止，空旷和不变的风景。里西亚人烟稀少，因为这就是它的意义所在；它是荒凉和孤独的，是一个你可以在其中行走数日却从未见过其他生物的领域。沙漠至少可以在微风中移动，而里西亚的冰雪景观是不变的。然而，与石头高原不同的是，它反映了一种可能在某一时刻发生变化的物质，但现在被抓住了，冻结了，停滞了。",
	"Though this isolated and unchanging plane might not seem appealing to adventurers, it's important to remember that the plane represents preservation—and ancient secrets forgotten for ages could be frozen within the ice. And while the realm itself is barren, it's not completely deserted; over millennia, hardy creatures have come to Risia and settled in this desolate realm.": "虽然这个与世隔绝、一成不变的星球对冒险者来说似乎没有什么吸引力，但重要的是要记住，这个星球代表着保存--被遗忘多年的古老秘密可能被冻结在冰层中。虽然这个领域本身是荒芜的，但它并不是完全荒废的；几千年来，顽强的生物已经来到里西亚并在这个荒凉的领域定居。",

	"A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 10 minutes or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that's usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.": "暴露在里西亚的寒冷中的生物必须每10分钟在DC10宪法救赎中成功，否则会获得一级的疲惫。对寒冷伤害有抵抗力或免疫力的生物会自动成功，自然适应寒冷气候的生物或穿着适当防护装备的生物也是如此。此外，所有的生物都对火灾伤害有抵抗力，而通常对火灾伤害有抵抗力的生物则对其免疫。",

While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn't grow older.": "命中率为0的生物在其回合结束时变得稳定，进入悬空的动画状态。如果一个无意识的生物与地面保持接触超过1分钟，它就会被拉到地表以下，并被包裹在一个冰封的静止状态中。当被包裹在这种方式中时，时间停止流动，它不会变老。",
	"When a creature finishes a long rest, it doesn't regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. However, it does recover Hit Dice normally and can spend them to regain hit points.": "当一个生物完成长期休息时，它不会重新获得命中率或降低其疲惫等级。然而，它可以正常地恢复命中率，并且可以用它们来恢复命中率。",
	"Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature's body, and creatures don't age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points, and don't immediately kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property's effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.": "时间的流逝速度与物质界相同，并且在各层之间是一致的。然而，时间的流逝对凡间生物的身体没有影响，生物在里西亚时不会衰老或成长。精疲力竭、饥饿和疾病只是将生物的命中率降至0，而不会立即杀死它。矮人对这个属性的影响是免疫的，在里西亚他们可以成长、衰老和死亡，就像他们在物质界一样。",
	"Risia's few natives are rarely seen. The concept of the plane is bleak isolation, and an active population would defeat this purpose. A few layers hold creatures that have crossed into Risia from Eberron, ones that can thrive in arctic conditions; there are remorhazes hunting in the Frozen Sea and yetis in the Frostmantle. But these things come and go. The two primary forces in Risia are the native spirits of the plane and the frost giants that have carved out a home in the ice.": "里西亚为数不多的本地人很少被看到。这个星球的概念是与世隔绝的，而活跃的人口会破坏这一目的。有几层楼里有从Eberron进入Risia的生物，这些生物可以在北极条件下生长；有在冰海中狩猎的remorhazes和在Frostmantle的etis。但这些东西来了又走。里西亚的两个主要力量是这个星球上的本土精神和在冰雪中开辟出一个家园的冰霜巨兽。",
	"At first glance, Risia appears to be barren and empty. But some travelers have described a presence, a sense of being watched, and most feel this presence is malign. On the surface, the concept of Risia seems entirely neutral; there's nothing inherently evil about ice. But there's a hunger to Risia—an innate desire to consume warmth and to bury living things in ice. In the {@i Planar Codex}, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran calls this force the Killing Cold. This greatest power of the plane of isolation is uninterested in being known, and has never interacted directly with outsiders, but its presence can be felt through its manifestations. These include bheur hags, frost salamanders, ice devils, chain devils, and the Lonely (sorrowsworn). The appearance and nature of manifestations reflect the themes of Risia—a chain devil might be shrouded by frost-mist and can bind its enemies with chains of ice. Regardless of their form, these spirits don't speak with outsiders. Their intelligence reflects the cunning with which they stalk their prey, but they are spirits of the Killing Cold, of bitter isolation, and of the ice that entombs and preserves.": "乍一看，里西亚似乎是荒芜和空旷的。但一些旅行者描述了一种存在，一种被监视的感觉，而且大多数人觉得这种存在是邪恶的。从表面上看，里西亚的概念似乎完全是中性的；冰没有任何内在的邪恶。但是里西亚有一种饥饿感--一种与生俱来的消耗温暖和将生物埋入冰中的欲望。在{@i Planar Codex}中，Dorius Alyre ir'Korran称这种力量为杀戮之寒。这股与世隔绝的最大力量对被人所知不感兴趣，也从未与外人直接互动，但通过其表现形式可以感受到它的存在。这些表现形式包括 \"冰女\"、\"霜螈\"、\"冰魔\"、\"链魔 \"和 \"孤独者\"（悲哀者）。表现形式的外观和性质反映了里西亚的主题--链魔可能被霜雾笼罩，可以用冰链束缚敌人。无论它们的形式如何，这些精灵都不会与外人交谈。他们的智慧反映了他们跟踪猎物的狡猾，但他们是杀戮之寒的精灵，是痛苦的隔离，是禁锢和保存的冰的精灵。",
	"When these manifestations aren't active, they're absorbed into their layer; they manifest when they're needed, in the form that's needed. And in the meantime, as spirits of stagnation and isolation, they're perfectly content to sit in silence for centuries before something compels them back into physical form.": "当这些表现形式不活跃时，它们被吸收到它们的层中；当需要它们时，它们会以需要的形式表现出来。同时，作为停滞和孤立的精神，它们完全满足于在沉默中坐上几个世纪，直到有东西迫使它们回到物质形态。",
	"The Group of Eleven was an alliance of empyreans of tremendous skill and power. Each studied a different plane (leaving Fernia to the Sulat League and Dal Quor to the Cul'sir). The archarcanist Il'Ara was devoted to Risia, and she magebred her own lineage of frost giants over millennia. When the forces of Argonnessen began to lay waste to Xen'drik, Il'Ara gathered her faithful children and passed through to Risia, certain that they could find sanctuary in the isolation of the Plain of Ice.": "十一国集团是一个由具有巨大技能和力量的帝王联盟。每个人都研究一个不同的平面（把费尔尼亚留给苏拉特联盟，把达尔奎尔留给库尔先生）。大法师伊拉（Il'Ara）致力于里西亚，她用魔法培育了自己的冰霜巨人血统，历时数千年。当阿贡纳森的军队开始浪费Xen'drik时，Il'Ara收集了她忠实的孩子们，并通过Risia，确信他们可以在冰原的隔离中找到避难所。",
	"Il'Ara's children have since established themselves across the layers of Risia. There are a few citadels where multiple giants live together, while others have established their own solitary outposts. Each has found a different path to surviving the endless tedium of immortality in the icy wastes. Some have become artists, writing poetry or sculpting massive works of art that take centuries to complete. Others pursue physical diversions such as wrestling, hunting fiends, or crafting ornate games. These denizens always take great interest in outsiders as a source of diversion. The crueler giants take joy in hunting newcomers, but others can be excellent hosts. Many artists yearn for an audience—though a genteel giant artist can be deadly if guests don't show proper appreciation for their work. As these Risian frost giants are remnants of the grand civilization of Xen'drik, the DM may wish to increase their intelligence and abilities as suits the story.": "Il'Ara的孩子们从此在里西亚的各层建立了自己的地位。有几个城堡是多个巨人共同生活的地方，而其他巨人则建立了自己的孤独前哨。每个人都找到了一条不同的道路，在冰冷的荒原上度过无尽的乏味的永生。有些人成为艺术家，写诗或雕刻巨大的艺术作品，需要几个世纪才能完成。其他人则追求身体上的消遣，如摔跤、猎杀恶魔，或制作华丽的游戏。这些居民总是对外来者产生极大的兴趣，作为消遣的来源。残忍的巨人以猎杀新来者为乐，但其他巨人也可以成为出色的主人。许多艺术家都渴望有观众--尽管如果客人不对他们的作品表示适当的赞赏，一个有风度的巨人艺术家也可能是致命的。由于这些里西亚冰霜巨人是Xen'drik宏伟文明的残余，DM可能希望根据故事的需要提高他们的智力和能力。",
	"Il'Ara continues her arcane studies in her fortress, Winter. She may have found ways to wield vast power over Risia and to protect her children from the fiends... or she could be bored of her immortal existence, considering entering the ice and embracing stasis.": "Il'Ara在她的堡垒Winter继续她的奥术研究。她可能已经找到了对里西亚挥舞巨大力量的方法，并保护她的孩子不受恶魔的伤害......或者她可能对她不朽的存在感到厌烦，考虑进入冰层，拥抱停滞。",
	"The frost giants of Risia have dwarf servants. Their origin is a mystery: the giants know that Il'Ara produced these first dwarves, but they don't know—or at least remember—if she created them herself or pulled them through from Eberron. These dwarves know no other existence than their servitude to their giant masters, and Risia holds few other options for them. Mysteriously, these dwarves—and all dwarves—are immune to the Stillness of Fleshproperty of Risia. They age just as they would on Eberron, and unlike other mortals on this plane, they can give birth to children who grow and mature. So every giant in Risia came from Xen'drik, and as they die, no new giants replace them; but the dwarves that dwell in Risia were born there, and know nothing of the ancient past.": "里西亚的冰霜巨人有矮人仆人。他们的起源是个谜：巨人知道伊尔阿拉产生了第一批矮人，但他们不知道--或者至少不记得--是她自己创造了他们，还是从艾伯伦拉来了他们。这些矮人除了为他们的巨人主人服务之外，不知道还有什么其他的存在，而里西亚对他们来说也没有什么其他的选择。神秘的是，这些矮人和所有的矮人都对里西亚的 \"肉体静止 \"属性免疫。他们的年龄就像在Eberron上一样，而且与这个位面的其他凡人不同，他们可以生下孩子，这些孩子会成长和成熟。所以里西亚的每一个巨人都来自Xen'drik，随着他们的死亡，没有新的巨人取代他们；但居住在里西亚的矮人却出生在那里，对古代的历史一无所知。",
	"The layers of Risia are few in number but vast in size, connected by great archways of ice. Sometimes, travelers find pools of ice that show images from other layers; breaking through this ice sometimes allows passage, while other times, the images are simply lost. While depictions of Risia often show it with terrifying storms, these are only found in the Boundless Blizzard; most of Risia is utterly still, silent, and deadly. Risia's spirit manifestations can be found in all of these layers. The giants are concentrated in Frostmantle, but outliers can be found in other layers.": "里西亚的层数不多，但面积很大，由巨大的冰拱门连接。有时，旅行者会发现显示其他层图像的冰池；突破这些冰层有时可以通过，而其他时候，这些图像就会消失。虽然对里西亚的描述经常显示它有可怕的风暴，但这些只在无边的暴风雪中发现；里西亚的大部分地区都是完全静止的，沉默的，致命的。里西亚的精神表现可以在所有这些层中找到。巨人集中在冰霜之城，但在其他层也能发现离群的巨人。",
	"The most noteworthy layers are discussed below, but others exist as well. One is a vast, featureless glacier, which may be the inspiration for the title \"The Plain of Ice.\" A small layer holds immense ice sculptures of unknown humanoids; this could be a reflection of primal beings, or perhaps the work of a frost giant artisan who's been sculpting for thousands of years. Another plane contains a series of rivers flowing over an icy plain, but they aren't natural water; the liquid is so cold it shatters any mundane material placed within it.": "下面将讨论最值得注意的层，但也存在其他层。一个是巨大的、没有特征的冰川，这可能是 \"冰原 \"这一名称的灵感来源。一个小平面上有巨大的冰雕，是未知的人类；这可能是原始生命的反映，也可能是一个冰霜巨人工匠几千年来的雕塑作品。另一个平面上有一系列的河流在冰原上流淌，但它们不是天然的水；液体是如此寒冷，以至于将任何世俗的材料放在其中都会被震碎。",
	"This seemingly endless range of mountains, formed of solid ice, is surrounded by a sea of dense mist. Perhaps land lies somewhere far below, or the mountains might continue down indefinitely into the darkness. Frostmantle is the primary home of the frost giants of Il'Ara, who have carved citadels from the ice of the mountains. The three largest fortresses are called Freehearth, Remorse, and Winter. Remorse holds many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom, while Winter is the abode of Il'Ara herself. Numerous smaller keeps are spread across the peaks, the abodes of individual giants.": "这座看似无尽的山脉，由坚冰形成，被一片浓密的雾海所包围。也许陆地就在下面的某个地方，或者山脉可能会无限地向下延伸到黑暗中。冰霜之城是伊尔阿拉的冰霜巨人的主要家园，他们在山脉的冰层上雕刻了城堡。三个最大的堡垒被称为Freehearth、Remorse和Winter。悔恨 \"关押着许多因永恒的无聊而选择进入冰冻状态的巨人，而 \"冬天 \"则是伊尔阿拉本人的住所。众多较小的堡垒分布在山峰上，是各个巨人的住所。",

	"Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. Explorers may find themselves on an icy plateau or in a mountain pass; with the vicious storm, visibility is limited to 60 feet, so there's no knowing what lies ahead. Adventurers may find an occasional cave or other shelter, but it's always possible that it's already occupied by a remorhaz or other stranded monstrosity. As this is one of the more dangerous layers, this is a good place to search for the frozen bodies of other adventurers, held in stasis beneath the ice.": "寒风呼啸，雪和冰雹充斥着空气。探险者可能会发现自己身处冰冷的高原或山口；在恶劣的风暴中，能见度被限制在60英尺以内，所以不知道前面有什么。冒险者可能偶尔会发现一个洞穴或其他庇护所，但它总是有可能已经被remorhaz或其他搁浅的怪兽占据。由于这是较危险的一层，这里是寻找其他冒险者的冰冻尸体的好地方，这些尸体被固定在冰下。",
	"The raging storm of the Boundless Blizzard never ends, and adventurers face high winds and lethal cold. The layer is permanently caught between night and day; due to the storm, the light is dim at best, and areas of intense snow may be heavily obscured.": "无边暴风雪的汹涌风暴从未停止过，冒险者面临着大风和致命的寒冷。该层长期处于白天和黑夜之间；由于暴风雪的影响，光线充其量是暗淡的，而积雪严重的地区可能被严重遮蔽。",
	"magine an ocean frozen in a single instant. There's no sign of any shore, just waves caught mid-crest alongside the frozen funnels of maelstroms. And scattered across the realm, there are countless ships—vessels pulled from the oceans of Eberron in moments when the moons were right and Risia was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked, caught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are in perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice. Ships from throughout history can be found here, Lyrandar elemental galleons alongside massive ships built by the ancient giants of Xen'drik. There could be age-old survivors here, sheltering in their trapped vessels, or a frost giant might have raised a tower of ice above the frozen water. But the spirits are strong here as well, preying on survivors and pulling them down into the frozen depths.": "想象一下，海洋在一瞬间被冻结。没有任何海岸的迹象，只有波浪在冰冻的漩涡漏斗旁被夹在半山腰。而散落在整个王国中的无数船只--在月亮正确和里西亚共存的时刻，从埃伯龙的海洋中拉出来的船只。有些船已经碎裂或失事，在沉没的过程中被抓住。另一些则完好无损，被冻结在最薄的冰层之下。在这里可以找到历史上的船只，Lyrandar元素的大帆船和Xen'drik的古代巨人建造的巨大船只。这里可能有年代久远的幸存者，在他们被困的船只中避难，或者一个冰霜巨人可能在冰水之上竖起了一座冰塔。但这里的鬼魂也很强大，它们捕食幸存者并将他们拉入冰冻的深处。",

	"Here are a few of the ways Risia can affect the Material Plane.": "以下是里西亚影响物质世界的几种方式。",
	"Manifest zones to Risia are often found in cold or arctic regions, where their impact isn't immediately obvious. In warmer climes, most manifest zones tied to Risia create regions of unnatural cold, often taking on the plane's Lethal Cold and Empowered Ice properties of the plane, regardless of the regional climate.": "与里西亚有关的显化区经常出现在寒冷或北极地区，它们的影响并不明显。在温暖的气候中，大多数与里西亚相连的显化区都会创造出非自然的寒冷区域，通常都会带上飞机的致命寒冷和赋能冰的属性，而不考虑地区气候。",
	"In a few Risian zones, the effects of Stillness of Flesh can be felt, slowing or completely stopping the aging, growth, and reproduction of all creatures—except for dwarves, that is. While a manifest zone that prevents aging could be otherwise considered quite a boon, these zones can be quite small, and often tied to deadly cold that makes it difficult to live there.": "在一些里斯安地区，可以感受到肉体静止的影响，减缓或完全停止所有生物的衰老、生长和繁殖--除了矮人，就是如此。虽然一个防止衰老的显化区在其他方面可以被认为是一个相当大的福音，但这些区域可能相当小，而且往往与致命的寒冷联系在一起，使人难以在那里生活。",
	"It's unusual for a Risian zone to transport people to Risia, but it can happen when the planes are coterminous.": "里西亚区把人运到里西亚是不寻常的，但在飞机相通的情况下，也会发生这种情况。",
	"While Risia is coterminous, temperatures drop sharply, and areas that would normally be chilly but otherwise safe can take on the Lethal Cold, Empowered Ice, and Stillness of Flesh universal properties. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense cold can be unexpectedly transported to Risia. However, this effect is unpredictable; while it can happen if it serves the story, it's not something most people are afraid of.": "在里西亚的时候，气温急剧下降，通常情况下寒冷但安全的地区会呈现出致命的寒冷、赋能的冰和静止的肉体的普遍属性。在这些时候，在罕见的情况下，陷入异常严寒地区的生物可以意外地被传送到里西亚。然而，这种效果是不可预测的；虽然它可以发生，如果它为故事服务，但它不是大多数人害怕的东西。",
	"When Risia is remote, intense cold loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made against the effects of extreme cold and on saving throws against spells that deal cold damage.": "当Risia在远处时，严寒会失去一些咬合力。生物在面对极度寒冷的影响时，以及在面对造成寒冷伤害的法术时，都有救命的优势。",
	"Traditionally, Risia becomes coterminous once every five years for the full month of Zarantyr. Once every five years, exactly two and a half years after it is coterminous, it's remote during the month of Lharvion. However, this isn't always the case. Historians have recorded times when the cycle has extended far longer; in 657 YK, Risia entered a coterminous phase that lasted for three years.": "传统上，里西亚每五年成为同位素一次，时间为扎兰泰尔的整月。每五年一次，在它成为同位素后整整两年半的时间里，它在Lharvion月里是遥远的。然而，这并不总是这样的。历史学家曾记录过周期延长得更久的时候；在公元657年，里西亚进入了一个持续了三年的同位素阶段。",
	"Risian ice is vivid blue and charged with the essence of the plane. This ice maintains its temperature under any conditions and never melts, even on the Material Plane. An object carved from Risian ice can be used as a spellcasting focus for spells related to ice or water, and it's a powerful component for creating magical effects related to cold or stasis. While it can develop in both manifest zones and on the plane itself, Risian ice is relatively rare even within Risia; you can't just find giant sheets of it spread across Frostmantle.": "瑞仙冰是鲜艳的蓝色，并充满了平面的精华。这种冰在任何情况下都能保持其温度，即使在物质界也不会融化。用里斯安冰雕刻的物体可以作为与冰或水有关的法术的施法焦点，它也是创造与寒冷或停滞有关的魔法效果的一个强大组件。虽然它可以在显露区和物质界本身发展，但即使是在里西亚，里斯安冰也是相对罕见的；你不可能找到遍布冰霜之城的巨大冰片。",
	"The frost giants possess magic items and artifacts that they brought with them from Xen'drik, and Il'Ara has surely created new wonders over the years. Adventurers could also find treasures from any civilization there, either buried in the Frozen Sea or still clutched in the hands of people entombed within the ice.": "冰霜巨人拥有他们从Xen'drik带来的魔法物品和工艺品，而Il'Ara多年来肯定也创造了新的奇迹。冒险家们还可以在那里找到任何文明的宝物，要么埋在冰海里，要么还攥在埋在冰里的人的手里。",

	"Il'Ara and her giants possess wondrous relics whose like haven't been seen in Eberron since the Age of Giants. They're a living link to the elven uprising; a giant might have personally fought a Tairnadal elf's ancestor, and it could possess a trophy taken from them. If the adventurers need information or an object from the Age of Giants, they might find it here. The adventurers could seek a ritual found only in Il'Ara's colossal spellbook, or perhaps the empyrean has kept a collection of prisoners from the Age of Giants preserved in Risian ice; this could be a way to meet a Qabalrin elf or one of the first drow!": "Il'Ara和她的巨人拥有奇妙的遗物，自巨人时代以来，在Eberron从未见过这样的东西。他们是精灵起义的一个活生生的纽带；一个巨人可能曾亲自与泰尔纳达尔精灵的祖先作战，它可能拥有从他们那里夺来的战利品。如果冒险者们需要巨人时代的信息或物品，他们可能会在这里找到它。冒险者可以寻找只有在伊尔阿拉的巨大法术书中才能找到的仪式，也可能是帝王把巨人时代的囚犯收集起来保存在里西亚的冰层中；这可能是见到卡巴林精灵或第一批鸦人的一个途径！\"。",
	"In searching for a vital artifact, the adventurers might learn it's on a ship trapped in the Frozen Sea. The trail of a lost explorer could lead to the Boundless Blizzard. While adventurers could recover valuable treasures from the ice, it's also possible to recover people from it. A legendary hero—or infamous villain—could have been trapped in Risia for centuries. What would happen if adventurers discovered the pirate queen Lhazaar in an icy stasis on her ship in the Frozen Sea?": "在寻找一件重要的文物时，冒险家们可能会得知它在一艘被困在冰冻海的船上。一个迷失的探险家的踪迹可能导致无边的暴风雪。虽然冒险者可以从冰雪中找到有价值的宝物，但也有可能从冰雪中找到人。一个传说中的英雄或臭名昭著的恶棍，可能已经被困在里西亚几个世纪了。如果冒险家们发现海盗女王拉扎尔在冰封海的船上被冰封，会发生什么？",
	"What's the origin of the dwarves of Risia? Did the empyrean Il'Ara truly create the dwarves, or did she steal them from the Frostfell? Could dwarf adventurers free their distant cousins from the domination of the giants?": "里西亚的矮人的起源是什么？是帝王伊尔阿拉真的创造了矮人，还是她从冰霜之城偷走了他们？矮人冒险家能否将他们的远房表亲从巨人的统治下解放出来？",
	"What is the sinister presence that drives the spirits of ice? No mortal has ever interacted directly with the Killing Cold.

	"In Shavarath, angels and devils are locked in endless conflict. Radiant blades spill burning blood, and bolts of force smash angels from the sky.

	"The war in Shavarath began at the moment of creation, and it will continue to the end of time. Its primary combatants are immortal, and fallen soldiers return within a day or so. The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, \"Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something—anything—else?\" In particular, it's common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, \"Why don't you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!\"": "沙瓦拉特的战争从创世的那一刻开始，并将持续到时间的尽头。它的主要战斗人员是不朽的，倒下的士兵在一天左右就会回来。双方势均力敌，不可能取得决定性的胜利。对外人来说，这场战争似乎毫无意义。在Nullius Terram过去四百年的冲突中，正义军团已经将其前线推进了大约20英尺。凡人看到这一点，可能会问：\"为什么要继续战斗？为什么不干脆离开斗争，做一些其他的事情--任何事情？\" 特别是，凡人看到天人在战争中投入的大量资源，通常会抗议：\"你们为什么不帮助我们？你们声称自己是正义军团，但在你们打这场毫无意义的战争时，无辜的人正在Thaliost死去！\"",
	"The angel isn't fighting for a single nation, and this war isn't driven by gold or politics. The immortals of Shavarathbelieve that their war is reflected across every reality. Justice. Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory—every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram—strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.": "天使并不是为一个国家而战，这场战争也不是由黄金或政治所驱动。沙瓦拉特的不朽者相信，他们的战争反映在每个现实中。正义。暴政。残酷。沙瓦拉斯的战争是这些力量之间力量平衡的明显象征，当它在沙瓦拉斯发生变化时，不朽者相信它在任何地方都会发生变化。堕落的魔鬼将获得重生。新的飞艇将取代那些被摧毁的飞艇。但是每一个微小的胜利--每一个被打败的恶魔，每一次在Nullius Terram的前进，都会加强各地的正义力量。每个天使都知道他们永远不会赢得真正的决定性胜利，但只要他们战斗，他们至少可以守住阵地。",
	"So to an angel, the destruction of a human city—or an entire nation—is trivial. Mortals will die; that's their most defining trait. Even a sympathetic angel sees a mortal as a snowflake: unique, beautiful, but gone in a moment (and sooner if you touch it). The angels fought long before today's mortal civilizations existed, and if they hadn't held this line for countless eons, the Material Plane would be overrun by chaos and cruelty.": "所以对天使来说，一个人类城市或整个国家的毁灭是微不足道的。凡人会死；这是他们最具决定性的特征。即使是有同情心的天使，也把凡人看成是一片雪花：独特、美丽，但一会儿就消失了（如果你碰它，会更快）。在今天的凡人文明存在之前，天使就已经在战斗了，如果他们没有坚守这条防线无数个世纪，物质界将被混乱和残酷所淹没。",
	"If you're a hero, you might look to the angel and say, \"What can I do to help? Can we fight at your side?\" To which the angel simply smiles and responds, \"You already are.\" Just as every mortal dreams in Dal Quor and has a shadow in Mabar, there's a sliver of every mortal soul that fights in Shavarath. The skill and power of these conscripts reflect your own courage and will... and just like the angels, this sliver of yours can survive a thousand deaths. So it's not your place to fight on the battlefields of Shavarath. You do your part by living your life, by fighting for the principles you believe in wherever you may be.": "如果你是一个英雄，你可能会看向天使并说，\"我能做些什么来帮助你？我们能在你身边战斗吗？\" 对此，天使只是微笑着回应说：\"你已经是了。\" 就像每个凡人都在达尔奎尔做梦，在马巴尔有一个影子一样，每个凡人的灵魂都有一丝丝在沙瓦拉斯战斗。这些应征者的技能和力量反映了你自己的勇气和意志......就像天使一样，你的这一丝可以在千军万马中生存。所以在沙瓦拉的战场上战斗不是你的职责。你通过生活来尽你的职责，通过为你所相信的原则而战斗，无论你在哪里。",

	"There's a part of you that's always been in Shavarath, a sliver of your soul that's always been at war. When you're in Shavarath, those instincts guide you. It's easier to strike a deadly blow, or to grit your teeth and fight on through pain or injury.": "你有一部分一直在Shavarath，你灵魂的一小部份一直在战争中。当你在Shavarath时，这些本能会引导你。打出致命的一击，或者咬紧牙关，在痛苦或受伤的情况下继续战斗，都比较容易。",

While a barbarian is raging, its rage can't be ended early unless it's knocked unconscious.": "一个生物在面对任何魅惑目标的法术或能力时，以及在面对平静情绪和避难所法术时，都有拯救的优势。此外，这些效果的持续时间减半，最小持续时间为1回合。当野蛮人处于愤怒状态时，它的愤怒不能提前结束，除非它被打晕了。",
	"On a creature's turn, it can use a bonus action to spend 1 Hit Die. It rolls the die and adds its Constitution modifier, regaining hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). Once a creature benefits from this property, it must finish a short or long rest before it can do so again.": "在一个生物的回合中，它可以使用一个额外的行动来花费1个命中率。它掷出骰子并加上它的体质修饰，重新获得与总数相等的命中率（最低为1）。一旦一个生物从这个属性中受益，它必须完成一个短期或长期的休息才能再次这样做。",
	"When a creature scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, it can roll one of the attack's damage dice one extra time and add it to the extra dice of the critical hit.": "当一个生物在造成穿刺、砍击或重击伤害的攻击中获得关键一击时，它可以额外掷出一个攻击的伤害骰子，并将其加入关键一击的额外骰子。",
	"Time's passage varies between Shavarath's layers. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane; if you spend an hour fighting in the Burning Sky, an hour passes in Eberron. But other layers move at different speeds; you can spend a month in the trenches of Nullius Terram and find that less than three days have passed in Eberron. A creature with proficiency in Arcana can determine the passage of time in their layer by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.": "时间的流逝在Shavarath的各层之间是不同的。在许多层中，时间的流逝速度与物质界相同；如果你在燃烧的天空中花了一个小时战斗，那么在Eberron就会过一个小时。但是其他层的速度不同；你可以在Nullius Terram的战壕里呆上一个月，却发现在Eberron里只过了不到3天。一个精通奥术的生物可以通过DC14智力({@skill Arcana})检查成功来确定他们层的时间流逝。",
	"All creatures in Shavarath are part of the war, whether they're soldiers, tools, or victims. Those that fight are tied to legions, such as the Legion of Justice or the Legion of Tyranny. The immortals that fight in the war believe that each legion is governed by a higher power—simply called Command—and that these powers collectively shape the layers and determine the terms of battle. Immortals don't question Command or wonder why things are the way they are. Immortals never deal directly with the Command of their legion, and they don't even know if these powers have physical forms.": "沙瓦拉斯的所有生物都是战争的一部分，无论他们是士兵、工具，还是受害者。那些战斗的人都与军团联系在一起，如正义军团或暴政军团。参战的不朽者相信，每个军团都被一种更高的力量所支配--简单地说就是指挥部--这些力量共同塑造了层级并决定了战斗的条件。不朽者不会质疑司令部，也不会想知道为什么事情是这样的。不朽者从不直接与他们军团的司令部打交道，他们甚至不知道这些力量是否有实体形式。",
	"Vast legions are broken into smaller cohorts, which are in turn divided into centuries of one hundred immortals, each representing an aspect of war like pain, mercy, or despair. A few special centuries and individual immortals can move between layers, but the majority are bound to their cohort and their layer. Immortals can be reassigned to new cohorts, and promoted or demoted—usually tied to a physical transformation. This minimal movement between layers maintains balance, as cohort leaders must make use of the forces in their layer, while legion commanders can strategically direct the centuries that can move between layers—what layer is Justice pressing at the moment?": "庞大的军团被分成较小的队列，而这些队列又被分成由100名不朽者组成的世纪，每个世纪都代表战争的一个方面，如痛苦、怜悯或绝望。一些特殊的世纪和个别不朽者可以在各层之间移动，但大多数人都被约束在他们的队列和他们的层。不朽者可以被重新分配到新的队列中，并被提升或降级--通常与身体的转变相关联。这种最低限度的层间移动保持了平衡，因为队列领导人必须利用其所在层的力量，而军团指挥官可以战略性地指挥可以在层间移动的世纪--哪一层目前是正义的压力？",
	"An offensive's primary goals often focus on destroying an important opponent. The Legion of Justice knows it can't drive Tyranny from Nullius Terram, but defeating Lord Commander Astaralax is an important victory for the light, even though he's an immortal and will eventually return. Sometimes an especially grand victory might cause an immortal to be \"discharged\"—when this happens, a new being of equivalent power takes its place, but it has a new personality, and the original spirit is eradicated. Such victories are worth even more points in the grand system that calculates the balance of power between the legions.": "一次进攻的主要目标往往集中在摧毁一个重要的对手上。正义军团知道它无法将暴政赶出Nullius Terram，但击败Astaralax司令官对光明来说是一个重要的胜利，尽管他是个不死之身，最终会回来。有时，一个特别伟大的胜利可能会导致一个不朽者被 \"遣散\"--当这种情况发生时，一个具有同等力量的新生命将取代它，但它有一个新的人格，而原来的精神则被根除。这样的胜利在计算军团之间力量平衡的大系统中价值更高。",
	"In Nullius Terram, the trenches are filled with miserable soldiers waiting for the offensive. The City of Knives is filled with innocents struggling to survive and looters taking advantage of the chaos. There are dragons in the Burning Sky—but none of these are mortals. They're all manifestations, ideas conscripted to serve the purpose of the story. Conscripts appear to be sentient, but have no depth of personality or memory, can't leave their layers, and can't accomplish anything meaningful unless accompanied by a celestial or fiend. It's only when the angel leads a charge that the conscripts of Nullius Terram matter, and though they inevitably die, they eventually reform. Conscripts can use the statistics of the creatures they appear to be, but may not have their full capabilities; the dragons of the Burning Sky aren't as intelligent as true dragons. A conscript usually appears indistinct; it's hard to focus on them, and it's often easy for a viewer to imagine conscripts are members of their own species.": "在Nullius Terram，战壕里到处是等待进攻的悲惨士兵。刀锋之城充满了挣扎求生的无辜者和趁乱抢劫的人。燃烧的天空里有龙--但这些都不是凡人。他们都是显像，是被征召来为故事服务的意念。应征者看起来是有知觉的，但没有深度的人格或记忆，不能离开他们的层，除非有天人或魔鬼陪伴，否则无法完成任何有意义的事情。只有在天使领导的冲锋中，Nullius Terram的应征者才是重要的，虽然他们不可避免地会死亡，但他们最终会被改造。应征者可以使用他们所出现的生物的统计数据，但可能没有他们的全部能力；燃烧的天空的龙并不像真正的龙那样聪明。应征者通常显得模糊不清；很难将注意力集中在他们身上，而且观众往往很容易想象应征者是他们自己物种的成员。",
	"All mortal creatures have a spiritual connection to Shavarath, and there's a sliver of their spirit in the plane. The strength of this sliver is determined by the mortal's courage, willpower, and martial drive. Conscripts are formed from this spiritual energy, but have no awareness and may be formed from multiple slivers; unlike Irian's embers, the conscript doesn't resemble the source.": "所有的凡人生物都与沙瓦拉斯有精神上的联系，在这个平面上有他们精神的一丝丝。这片精神的强度由凡人的勇气、意志力和武功决定。应征者是由这种精神能量形成的，但没有意识，可能由多个碎片形成；与伊里安的余烬不同，应征者并不像来源。",
	"Sometimes, on the death of a great mortal warrior, echoes of their personality and martial spirit can coalesce into a sword wraith (though its abilities may vary based on the champion it echoes). Unlike standard conscripts, sword wraiths are capable of meaningful action even without the direction of an immortal and can command conscripts of their own. A sword wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of the memories, but it's only an echo of the mortal, much like the traces of memory that allow you to speak with dead. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. If there's a sword wraith of Karrn the Conqueror commanding troops in Nullius Terram, he believes that he's fighting for Karrnath and can't be convinced otherwise; after all, he's only a memory, and there are limits to his ability to reason.": "有时，在一个伟大的凡人战士死后，他们的人格和武术精神的回声可以凝聚成一个剑灵（尽管它的能力可能根据它所回声的冠军而有所不同）。与标准的应征者不同，剑灵即使没有不朽者的指导，也能采取有意义的行动，并能指挥他们自己的应征者。剑灵有其凡人来源的外观和一些记忆，但它只是凡人的回声，就像允许你与死者对话的记忆痕迹一样。剑裹尸人将他们的记忆与层内的战争相协调。如果有一个征服者卡尔恩的剑灵在Nullius Terram指挥军队，他相信自己是在为卡尔纳特而战，而且不能被说服；毕竟他只是一个记忆，而且他的推理能力是有限的。",
	"So adventurers might meet Lhazaar as she commands a ship in the Bloody Sea. Dhakaani champions, the Mror clan founders, heroes of the Last War—any of these could be found as sword wraiths, serving the legion that best matches their values. There are sword wraiths of many patron ancestors of the Tairnadal elves; however, these aren't the patrons themselves, simply echoes left behind. While sword wraiths generally form after a mortal's death, the slivers of especially remarkable heroes can manifest sword wraiths even while alive. King Boranel of Breland surely has a sword wraith serving in the Legion of Justice, and it's possible an adventurer could meet their own sword wraith while exploring Shavarath.": "因此，冒险者可能会在血海中指挥一艘船时遇到拉扎尔。达卡尼（Dhakaani）的冠军、莫洛（Moror）家族的创始人、最后战争的英雄--这些人中的任何一个都可以作为剑灵被发现，为最符合他们价值观的军团服务。泰尔纳达尔精灵的许多守护者祖先都有剑灵；然而，这些并不是守护者本身，只是留下的回声。虽然剑灵通常在凡人死后形成，但特别杰出的英雄的碎片甚至在活着的时候也能显现出剑灵。布雷兰国王博拉内尔（Boranel）肯定有一个剑灵在正义军团服役，而冒险者也有可能在探索沙瓦拉斯的时候遇到自己的剑灵。",
	"Shavarath's whirling blades are enigmatic and deadly. These manifestations are swarms of animated weapons—knives, swords—that tear through the air, eviscerating anything unfortunate enough to be in their path. Sometimes they follow consistent paths like flocks of birds. Other times, they appear in a flash, lashing at victims, then vanishing. The whirling blades may be a defense mechanism designed to keep mortals from interfering with Shavarath, and the longer mortals remain in Shavarath, the more likely they are to be struck. These blade storms can also leak out into the Material Plane in areas of particularly brutal conflict, spilling blood on all sides.": "沙瓦拉特的旋风之刃是神秘而致命的。这些表现形式是成群结队的灵动武器--刀、剑--在空中撕扯，将任何不幸挡在它们前面的东西斩尽杀绝。有时，它们像鸟群一样遵循一致的路径。其他时候，它们会在瞬间出现，向受害者扑去，然后消失。旋转的刀片可能是一种防御机制，旨在防止凡人干扰沙瓦拉斯，凡人在沙瓦拉斯停留的时间越长，他们就越有可能被击中。在特别残酷的冲突地区，这些刀锋风暴也会泄露到物质界，使各方都血流成河。",
	"Whirling blades might take the form of a {@spell cloud of daggers}, though the area and damage might both increase, or the most devastating manifestations could be represented with a {@spell blade barrier} that slowly moves across the terrain.": "旋转的刀片可能采取{@spell cloud of daggers}的形式，虽然面积和伤害可能都会增加，或者最具有破坏性的表现可以用{@spell blade barrier}来表示，在地形上缓慢移动。",
	"Most of Shavarath's celestials serve the Legion of Justice, which embodies the concept of war fought for a just cause. Cohorts and their component centuries represent specific concepts within that broad ideal. The Century of Mercy shows kindness to fallen foes, while the Century of the Innocent Guard protects civilians—even if they're just conscripts, the idea of civilians—and avoids collateral damage. Angels won't conscript adventurers, but also won't leave their duties to help them.": "沙瓦拉斯的大多数天人都为正义军团服务，它体现了为正义事业而战的概念。队列和他们的组成世纪代表了这一广泛理想中的具体概念。慈悲世纪对倒下的敌人表示仁慈，而无辜卫士世纪则保护平民--即使他们只是应征者，也就是平民的概念，并避免附带损害。天使不会征召冒险者，但也不会离开他们的职责去帮助他们。",
	"The angels of Shavarath have a martial aspect, most appearing clad in armor, with their faces—and species—hidden behind full helms. Any sort of angel can be found in Shavarath, with its power reflecting its position. Planetars command centuries, while each cohort is commanded by a solar or a celestial being of greater power, such as an empyrean. While the angels serve Justice Command, there are a few units also devoted to the Sovereigns. The Century of the Sun asserts that Dol Arrah is Justice Command, and sword wraiths formed from paladins of Dol Arrah serve with this century.": "沙瓦拉斯的天使有一个武术方面的特点，大多数都身穿盔甲出现，他们的脸和种类都被隐藏在全盔后面。任何种类的天使都可以在沙瓦拉斯找到，其力量反映了其地位。星球人指挥着几个世纪，而每个队列则由一个太阳人或具有更大力量的天体来指挥，比如说帝王。虽然天使们为正义司令部服务，但也有一些单位专门为主权者服务。太阳世纪宣称多尔-阿拉赫就是正义司令部，而由多尔-阿拉赫的圣骑士组成的剑灵则与这个世纪一起服务。",
	"While the Legion of Justice is the largest of the celestial legions, there are others that operate on a smaller scale. Most notable of these is the Legion of Freedom, reflecting the ideal of war fought to end oppression. They rarely field large armies and instead use swift strikes and guerrilla war; these angels embody the idea of champions who fight impossible odds for a noble cause, even if this forces them to follow ignoble paths.": "虽然正义军团是最大的天体军团，但还有其他一些军团在较小的范围内运作。其中最引人注目的是自由军团，反映了为结束压迫而进行战争的理想。他们很少出动大军，而是采用快速打击和游击战；这些天使体现了为崇高的事业与不可能的困难作斗争的冠军思想，即使这迫使他们走上不光彩的道路。",
	"Demons represent the chaotic savagery of war. Most serve the Legion of Cruelty, and are wild, brutal, and far less disciplined than the devilish forces of Tyranny. They torture civilians, have no concern for collateral damage or their own losses, and make little effort to hold territory. Their focus is purely on inflicting maximum damage on foes and their own region alike. The Century of the Salted Earth devastates the regions they fight in, while the Century of Terror creates hideous displays with the corpses of their victims and delights in psychological warfare. The Legion of Cruelty slaughters devils and angels with equal glee, and is despised by Justice and Tyranny alike.": "魔鬼代表着战争的混乱野蛮。大多数为残酷军团服务，他们狂野、残暴，远不如暴政的魔鬼部队有纪律。他们折磨平民，对附带损害或自己的损失毫不关心，而且很少努力守住领土。他们的重点纯粹是对敌人和他们自己的地区造成最大的伤害。咸鱼世纪 \"破坏了他们战斗的地区，而 \"恐怖世纪 \"则用他们受害者的尸体创造了可怕的展示，并以心理战为乐。残酷军团以同样的快乐屠杀魔鬼和天使，并被正义和暴政所鄙视。",
	"All manner of demons can be found in the Legion of Cruelty; their form reflects their military role, and many wear battered armor, steel scales, or are simply coated in fresh blood. Barlguras and hezrous are brutal shock troops. Chasmes and vrocks flood the skies, while goristros are living siege weapons. Mariliths and balors command centuries, while cohorts may be led by beings with the power of demon princes. As with all immortals of Shavarath, it's important to remember that these demons are first and foremost embodiments of war; regardless of what role a demon might play on another plane, here, it's devoted purely to the eternal war. It could be that there is a Cohort of Bones that uses undead conscripts in battle, commanded by a fiend with the stat block of Orcus—but this commander wouldn't have Orcus's ambitions, instead focusing on crushing the Cohort of the Sun in its layer.": "在残酷军团中可以找到各种形式的恶魔；他们的形态反映了他们的军事角色，许多人穿着破烂的盔甲、钢制的鳞片，或者只是涂着鲜血。巴尔古拉和赫兹鲁斯是残酷的冲击部队。裂缝和岩浆充斥着天空，而戈里斯特罗是活生生的攻城武器。Mariliths和balors指挥着几个世纪，而同伙们可能由具有恶魔王子力量的人领导。与沙瓦拉斯的所有不朽者一样，重要的是要记住，这些恶魔首先是战争的化身；无论恶魔在其他位面可能扮演什么角色，在这里，它纯粹是为了永恒的战争。可能有一个骨之队在战斗中使用不死的应征者，由一个拥有奥库斯体质的恶魔指挥--但这个指挥官不会有奥库斯的野心，而是专注于粉碎太阳之队这一层。",
	"As with angels devoted to the Sovereigns, some demons dedicate themselves and their unit to the Dark Six. Many within the Century of Terror wear the flayed skins of their foes and assert that the Mockery is part of Cruelty Command.": "就像天使献给圣主一样，一些恶魔将自己和他们的部队献给了黑暗六神。恐怖世纪内的许多人穿上了他们敌人的剥皮，并宣称嘲讽是残酷司令部的一部分。",
	"Devils can be just as cruel as demons, but they represent the disciplined practice of war in pursuit of oppression, and most serve the Legion of Tyranny. They seek to crush hope, and no form of treachery or dishonorable conduct is too low for a devil. However, they're far more disciplined than the savage hordes of the Legion of Cruelty, working with precision and careful plans. The Century of Chains forces enemy conscripts (and unlucky adventurers) to fight for them, and uses civilian conscripts as living shields. The Century of the Serpent is always willing to negotiate and makes many pleasing offers, but any agreement inevitably leads to betrayal.": "魔鬼可以像恶魔一样残忍，但他们代表了追求压迫的有纪律的战争实践，而且大多数为暴政军团服务。他们寻求粉碎希望，对魔鬼来说，任何形式的背叛或不光彩的行为都是太低级了。然而，他们比残酷军团的野蛮成群结队要有纪律性得多，工作精确，计划细致。枷锁世纪强迫敌人的义务兵（和不幸的冒险者）为他们作战，并把平民义务兵作为活的盾牌。蛇之世纪总是愿意谈判，并提出许多讨好的条件，但任何协议都不可避免地会导致背叛。",
	"All forms of devils can be found in the Legion of Tyranny. Their sole focus is war; they dominate and corrupt conscripts, but don't seek mortal souls from the Material Plane. Bearded and spined devils serve as basic troops, while elite squads of erinyes descend from the sky. Amnizu and balors command centuries, and beings with the power of archdevils lead cohorts.": "所有形式的魔鬼都可以在暴政军团中找到。他们唯一的关注点是战争；他们支配并腐蚀应征者，但不从物质世界寻找凡人的灵魂。有胡子和有刺的魔鬼作为基本部队，而精锐的埃林耶斯小队则从天而降。阿姆尼祖（Amnizu）和巴洛尔（balors）指挥着几个世纪，而拥有大恶魔力量的生物则领导着同伙。",
	"The devils of the Cohort of Misery say that the Mockery is part of Tyranny Command, a belief that fuels a bitter enmity with the demons of the Century of Terror. Curiously, the Cohort of the Iron Hand maintains that the Sovereign Aureon leads Tyranny Command, and that they are simply enacting his vision for universal order.": "痛苦之队的魔鬼们说，嘲讽是暴政司令部的一部分，这种信念助长了与恐怖世纪的魔鬼们的仇恨。奇怪的是，\"铁手队 \"坚持认为，主权者奥里昂领导着暴政司令部，他们只是在制定他对普遍秩序的愿景。",
	"The battlefields of Shavarath contain engines of war unlike anything imagined on Eberron. Steel krakens in the Bloody Sea. Massive cannons that could bring down Sharn's towers with a single volley. Immense monstrosities that serve as living battering rams. However, even the grandest of these creations isn't a product of industry or arcane science—these too are conscripts. The mighty cannon isn't forged in some great foundry, but formed by the layer itself, because it's part of the {@i idea} of this battle. Fernia is a plane of industry where an artificer might learn amazing techniques from the dao; by contrast, in Shavarath, an artificer might be inspired by what they see, but most of the greatest weapons can't be replicated.": "沙瓦拉斯的战场包含了不同于Eberron上任何想象的战争引擎。血海中的钢铁克拉肯。巨大的加农炮可以一炮击倒沙恩的塔楼。巨大的怪兽作为活的撞锤。然而，即使是这些最宏伟的创造物也不是工业或神秘科学的产物--它们也是征召来的。强大的大炮并不是在某个伟大的铸造厂里锻造出来的，而是由这一层本身形成的，因为它是这场战斗的（%0%）的一部分。费尔尼亚是一个工业平面，工匠可能会从道上学到惊人的技术；相比之下，在沙瓦拉斯，工匠可能会从他们看到的东西中得到启发，但大多数最伟大的武器是无法复制的。",
	"Shavarath has countless layers, each one reflecting a different struggle. There's a vicious guerilla war in the Forest of Shadows. The Monolith is a mighty fortress that's always under siege; occasionally, the attackers tear it away from the defenders, at which point the former defenders begin the siege anew. Layers are connected by a network of heavily fortified portals, though the most powerful immortals can shift between layers under their own power. Every legion has a command center or headquarters in the layers in which they operate. The legion might only assign a few centuries to smaller layers, but if a layer's large enough—such as Nullius Terram—it may host an entire cohort.": "沙瓦拉斯有无数个层次，每一个层次都反映了不同的斗争。阴影森林里有一场恶性的游击战。巨石是一个强大的堡垒，一直被围困着；偶尔，攻击者会把它从守卫者手中夺走，这时，前守卫者又开始了新的围困。各层之间是通过重重设防的传送门网络连接的，尽管最强大的不朽者可以凭借自己的力量在各层之间转换。每个军团都有一个指挥中心或总部在他们所处的层级。军团可能只把几个世纪分配给较小的层，但如果一个层足够大--比如Nullius Terram--它可能会容纳整个军团。",
	"These are a few examples of layers of Shavarath, but almost any vision of war could spawn a layer.": "这些是Shavarath层的几个例子，但几乎任何对战争的看法都可以催生一个层。",
	"One of the largest layers, Nullius Terram is a battlefield the size of a small nation. It's divided by several deep, heavily fortified trenches, which are separated by blasted regions of scorched earth, blast craters, and bones. Nullius Terram's multiple trench lines twist and curve throughout the region, and in the lands between the trenches lie strategic outposts. The region is marked by constant barrages and terrible tools of mass destruction—widescale {@spell cloudkill}, curses that transform conscripts into killers, and worse.": "作为最大的一层，Nullius Terram是一个战场，面积相当于一个小国家。它被几条深邃的、重兵把守的战壕分割开来，战壕被焦土、爆炸坑和骨头组成的爆破区隔开。Nullius Terram的多条战壕线在整个区域内蜿蜒曲折，而在战壕之间的土地上则是战略前哨。该地区的特点是持续的炮击和可怕的大规模杀伤性工具--大范围（%0%），将应征者变成杀手的诅咒，以及更糟糕的情况。",
	"Tyranny, Cruelty, and Justice are the three active legions in this region. Justice has a difficult position in Nullius Terram, but has been slowly gaining strength. Periodically, the commanders send troops to clash in the fields between the lines, either in simple skirmishes or full offensives. Ultimately, the theme of this layer is that of slow, agonizing stalemate, and the suffering war can inflict on both the land and the soldiers.": "暴政、残酷和正义是这个地区的三个活跃军团。正义在Nullius Terram的地位很困难，但一直在慢慢增强实力。指挥官们定期派遣部队在两线之间的战场上发生冲突，要么是简单的小规模冲突，要么是全面的攻势。最终，这一层的主题是缓慢、痛苦的僵局，以及战争对土地和士兵造成的痛苦。",
	"Nullius Terram is noteworthy for its flowing time; for every 10 minutes that pass in this layer, only 1 minute passes in Eberron. So it's a long, slow struggle—you could spend months here and only miss a week in Eberron.": "Nullius Terram因其流动的时间而值得注意；在这一层每过10分钟，在Eberron只有1分钟。所以这是一场漫长而缓慢的斗争--你可以在这里呆上几个月，而在Eberron只错过一个星期。",
	"The sky is filled with many airships, some large enough to be floating towns. A few islands of rock float amongst the solid clouds, but if there's any land below, it's hidden by deadly fog. While there are skirmishes on the stone islands, most of the action occurs in the skies. Winged angels and fiends circle and duel, while conscripts guide dragons and other aerial mounts.": "天空中充满了许多飞艇，有些大到可以成为漂浮的城镇。几座石岛漂浮在坚实的云层中，但如果下面有任何陆地，也被致命的雾气所掩盖。虽然石岛上有小规模的冲突，但大部分的行动都发生在天空中。有翅膀的天使和恶魔在空中盘旋和决斗，而应征者则引导龙和其他空中坐骑。",
	"It looks like this was once a city of marvels, with towers rivaling those of Sharn, gilded monuments, museums, gardens, and more. But the City of Knives lies between vast armies of the Legion of Justice and the Legion of Tyranny, and it represents the impact of brutal war on a glorious city. Ongoing bombardment is a constant threat. The civilian conscripts are fighting their own war for shelter and supplies; some rally together for the common good, while others have become looters and brigands. Justice and Tyranny hold their positions on either side of the city, relying on bombardment and occasional assaults. The Legion of Cruelty spreads terror within the city, while the celestials of the Legion of Freedom seek to rally the common people against all enemies.": "看上去这里曾经是一座充满奇迹的城市，有可与沙恩媲美的塔楼、镀金的纪念碑、博物馆、花园等等。但刀城位于正义军团和暴政军团的庞大军队之间，它代表了残酷的战争对一座辉煌的城市的影响。持续的轰炸是一种持续的威胁。平民应征者正在为他们自己的住所和供应品而战；一些人为了共同的利益团结在一起，而另一些人则成为抢劫者和强盗。正义和暴政在城市的两边坚守阵地，依靠轰炸和偶尔的攻击。残酷军团在城市内散布恐怖，而自由军团的天人则试图团结普通人对抗所有敌人。",
	"There are no continents in this aquatic layer, but a handful of islands support the warring fleets. Grand and powerful warships clash in the open waters and bombard settlements. The ships may be familiar, but there are many other unusual engines of war: constructed krakens, submersible warships, monstrosities and dragons bound to service—wonders that the people of Eberron can {@i imagine} but can't yet create. The pirate queen Lhazaar surely has inspired a sword wraith in the Bloody Sea... but which legion does her sword wraith fight for?": "在这个水生层中没有大陆，但有少数岛屿支持着交战的舰队。宏大而强大的战舰在开放的水域中发生冲突，并对定居点进行轰炸。这些战舰可能很熟悉，但还有许多其他不寻常的战争引擎：建造的克拉肯（Krakens）、潜水战舰、怪兽和被捆绑在服务上的龙--Eberron的人们可以（%0%）但还不能创造的奇迹。海盗女王拉扎尔（Lhazaar）肯定在血海中激发了一个剑灵......但她的剑灵为哪个军团而战？",
	"At first glance, this layer looks like the blasted land between the trenches of Nullius Terram. It's home to a number of warring cities, but they aren't static settlements. Rather, some are floating fortresses that dwarf the Argonth of Breland, and others walk on two legs. The warforged colossus in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|book} could be used as a model for a small fortress.": "乍一看，这一层就像Nullius Terram的战壕之间被炸毁的土地。它是许多交战城市的家园，但它们不是静态的定居点。相反，有些是漂浮的堡垒，使布雷兰的阿冈斯相形见绌，还有一些是用两条腿走路。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|book}中的战神巨像可以作为一个小型堡垒的模型。",
	"Here are a few ways Shavarath can affect the Material Plane.": "以下是沙瓦拉斯影响物质世界的几种方式。",
	"Manifest zones tied to Shavarath often inspire people to violence and aggression, and can convey any of the plane's universal properties. These zones can be dangerous places to dwell, but can also encourage martial discipline and enhance training. While many of the greatest weapons in Shavarath can't be removed from the plane, manifest zones tied to Shavarath can often provide inspiration for artificers and smiths, and it may be possible to craft deadly enchantments in a Shavaran manifest zone that simply aren't possible beyond it.": "与沙瓦拉斯相关的显化区往往会激发人们的暴力和侵略性，并能传达该平面的任何普遍属性。这些区域可能是危险的居住地，但也可以鼓励武术纪律和加强训练。虽然沙瓦拉的许多最伟大的武器无法从这个位面移出，但与沙瓦拉相关的显化区往往可以为工匠和铁匠提供灵感，而且有可能在沙瓦拉显化区制作致命的魔法，而这些魔法在显化区之外根本不可能。",
	"Manifest zones rarely act as gateways to Shavarath, but anything is possible when Shavarath is coterminous.": "表现区很少作为通往沙瓦拉的门户，但当沙瓦拉同在时，一切皆有可能。",
	"When Shavarath is coterminous, people are quick to anger and must be careful to not fight over trivial things. Angry words are more likely to produce brawls, and restless thought to lead to riots or revolutions. The plane's War Magic and Unquenchable Fury properties spread worldwide while it's coterminous, encouraging violence. Meanwhile, in Shavaran manifest zones, outbreaks of intense violence can draw whirling blades into the zone, slaughtering people on all sides.": "当Shavarath是同位的时候，人们很快就会发怒，必须注意不要为小事而打架。愤怒的话语更容易产生争吵，而不安的思想则会导致暴动或革命。该平面的战争魔法和永不熄灭的怒火属性在其共存时传播到全世界，鼓励暴力。同时，在沙瓦兰的表现区，激烈的暴力爆发会把旋风刀吸引到这个区域，屠杀各方的人。",
	"Shavarath is traditionally coterminous for 1 year every 36 years. Throughout history, some military leaders have plotted campaigns around this, while peaceful communities plan ahead to contain violence. In addition to its regular cycle, Shavarath frequently grows coterminous for a single day; predicting these periods was critical for battle strategy during the Last War. Shavarath is traditionally remote for a year every 36 years, which prevents the occasional single-day coterminous spikes, but otherwise has no apparent effect on the Material Plane.": "传统上，Shavarath每36年有1年是同位的。纵观历史，一些军事领导人围绕这一点策划战役，而和平社区则提前计划以遏制暴力。除了常规的周期外，Shavarath还经常在一天内增长；在最后一次战争中，预测这些时期对战斗策略至关重要。传统上，沙瓦拉斯每36年就会偏离一年，这就避免了偶尔出现的单日同向增长，但除此之外对物质世界没有明显影响。",
	"Unlike Fernian elementals, the immortals of Shavarath don't create their weapons and tools of war; they're shaped by the plane itself. Many of the grandest weapons—explosives that can level cities, airships the size of small towns—either can't be removed from Shavarath or wouldn't function elsewhere. But Shavarath is a potential source for armor, weapons, and tools of war, from common items to the artifacts wielded by the commanders of cohorts. These may be some of the most powerful weapons in the multiverse—but they're also irreplaceable. You can steal the {@item wand of orcus||Wand of Orra'Cys}, lord of the Cohort of Bones—but he'll certainly want it back, and may deploy demons, warlocks, or other agents to reclaim it.": "与费尔尼亚元素不同，沙瓦拉斯的不朽者并不创造他们的武器和战争工具；他们是由飞机本身塑造的。许多最伟大的武器--可以夷平城市的炸药，和小城镇一样大的飞艇--要么无法从沙瓦拉斯移走，要么在其他地方无法发挥作用。但是沙瓦拉特是一个潜在的盔甲、武器和战争工具的来源，从普通物品到同伙的指挥官所挥舞的神器。这些可能是多元宇宙中最强大的一些武器--但它们也是不可替代的。你可以偷取骨之队领主的（%0%）--但他肯定会想要回它，并可能部署恶魔、术士或其他代理人来夺回它。",
	"The legion an item is associated with affects its appearance. Tools of the Legion of Justice are bright and inspiring, while those tied to the Legion of Tyranny are grim and intimidating.": "一件物品与哪个军团有关会影响其外观。正义军团的工具是明亮和鼓舞人心的，而那些与暴政军团有关的工具则是严峻和令人生畏的。",
	"The simplest story is one of survival, escaping from Shavarath before being destroyed by the endless war. But Shavaran adventures touch the Material Plane too; here are some ideas.": "最简单的故事是关于生存的故事，在被无尽的战争摧毁之前逃离沙瓦拉思。但沙瓦拉的冒险也触及物质世界；这里有一些想法。",
	"Cannith builds a forgehold for manufacturing weapons on a manifest zone tied to Shavarath. All goes well—until a planar spike unleashes whirling blades and everything is thrown into chaos. Making things worse, some experimental constructs have gone berserk, an experimental Shavaran explosive is detonating in five hours... and it's possible an agent of the Lord of Blades has infiltrated the hold in the chaos. Can the adventurers get things under control?": "坎尼斯在一个与沙瓦拉斯相连的宣言区建立了一个制造武器的锻造厂。一切都很顺利，直到一个平面钉子释放出旋转的刀片，一切都被抛入混乱之中。更糟糕的是，一些实验性的构造物已经发狂，一种实验性的沙瓦拉炸药将在五小时内引爆......而刀锋之主的一名特工可能已经在混乱中渗透到了工场。冒险家们能控制住局面吗？",
	"In Fairhaven, an artificer creates an eldritch machine to channel Shavarath's power—but it works too well. When Shavarath becomes coterminous, the eldritch machine amplifies everyone's aggression. Riots and looting break out across the city, while the guards act brutally to contain it. Can the adventurers find and deactivate the machine before the city tears itself apart? Is this the work of a single reckless artificer, or tied to the cult of Rak Tulkhesh or the Order of the Emerald Claw?": "在费尔哈文，一个工匠创造了一个长生机来引导Shavarath的力量--但它的效果太好。当Shavarath成为同体时，长生机放大了每个人的侵略性。骚乱和掠夺在整个城市爆发，而守卫们则以残酷的方式来控制它。冒险家们能否在城市分崩离析之前找到并解除机器的功能？这究竟是一个鲁莽的工匠的杰作，还是与拉克-图尔克什的邪教或翡翠之爪组织有关？",
	"The adventurers find a corpse clutching a vorpal sword—the blade of Misery, an erinyes of the Legion of Tyranny. An agent of the Argentum died while attempting to take the blade to a place it could be destroyed. Will the adventurers try to complete the mission, or claim the powerful sword as a trophy? If they choose to keep it, Misery will eventually come looking for her sword... and this cruel immortal will want to take some time to torment any mortals who have sullied her blade.": "冒险家们发现了一具尸体，手里握着一把斩首剑--Misery之刃，是暴政军团的一员。一名阿根特姆的特工在试图将这把剑带到一个可以摧毁它的地方时死亡。冒险家们是想完成任务，还是把这把强大的剑当作战利品？如果他们选择保留它，Misery最终会来寻找她的剑......而这个残忍的不朽者会想花些时间来折磨那些玷污了她的剑的凡人。",
	"Imagine a perfect blue sky, stretching off into the horizon. There's no sign of the sun, but the sky is clear and bright, and the floating crystal towers gleam as if caught in a sunbeam. A warm, gentle breeze brushes over you, and there's a faint sound of distant chimes. You feel absolutely calm; in this moment, all anger melts away.": "想象一下，一个完美的蓝天，一直延伸到地平线。没有太阳的迹象，但天空清澈明亮，漂浮的水晶塔闪闪发光，仿佛被太阳光照到。一阵温暖、柔和的微风拂过你的身体，远处传来微弱的风铃声。你感到绝对平静；在这一刻，所有的愤怒都融化了。",
	"This is Syrania, the Azure Sky. While people often think of its floating towers and crystal spires—the same magic that sustains the great towers of Sharn—Syrania is the plane of peace and all that flourishes in peaceful times: commerce, education, reflection. There are no vast armies here, no dangerous monsters. The magic of Syrania allows all creatures to communicate and dispels aggression. As such, it's a common crossroads for beings who do travel the planes, and the Immeasurable Market of Syrania is the safest place to interact with fiends, slaadi, and other extraplanar beings. However, while bloodshed is rare in the Azure Sky, you can still make deadly enemies; mortals are always wise to tread lightly in the cities of angels.": "这就是锡兰尼亚，蔚蓝的天空。虽然人们经常想到它的浮动塔和水晶尖顶--与支撑沙恩的大塔相同的魔法--但西拉尼亚是和平的平面，以及所有在和平时期繁荣的东西：商业、教育、思考。这里没有庞大的军队，没有危险的怪兽。西拉尼亚的魔法允许所有生物进行交流，并驱散侵略性。因此，它是那些确实在各个星球上旅行的生物的共同十字路口，而西拉尼亚的无量市场是与恶魔、斯拉迪和其他星外生物交流的最安全的地方。然而，虽然在蔚蓝天空很少发生流血事件，但你仍然可以结交致命的敌人；凡人在天使之城总是明智地轻装前进。",
	"Syrania encourages communication and negotiation, and grants all creatures the gift of flight. The Open Sky of Syrania is an endless void, and without flight, you could fall indefinitely; fortunately, all creatures find that they can move through the air just as naturally as walking.": "西拉尼亚鼓励交流和谈判，并赋予所有生物飞行的天赋。西拉尼亚的开阔天空是一片无尽的虚空，如果没有飞行，你可能会无限期地坠落；幸运的是，所有生物都发现他们可以在空中移动，就像走路一样自然。",

	"Syrania is a curiously empty plane. While the Immeasurable Market is always bustling, most of this traffic is comprised of creatures from other planes. Syrania's other spires have comparatively few inhabitants—not so few that they feel desolate or barren, just enough so that it always feels slow and peaceful. There's no need for people to perform menial tasks in Syrania, nor does this plane have manifestations to populate it; damaged structures gradually repair themselves, and litter and debris slowly dissolve.": "西拉尼亚是一个奇怪的空旷的平面。虽然无量市场总是熙熙攘攘，但大部分的交通都是由来自其他星球的生物组成的。西拉尼亚的其他尖塔的居民相对较少--不是少到让人感觉荒凉或贫瘠，只是足够让人感觉缓慢和平静。在西拉尼亚不需要人去做琐碎的工作，这个平面也没有显像来填充它；损坏的结构会逐渐自我修复，垃圾和碎片会慢慢溶解。",
	"The native inhabitants of Syrania are winged humanoid immortals, collectively referred to as angels, though they differ from those of other planes in some important ways. While they're considered to be celestials, most angels of Syrania are neutral in alignment. They aren't champions of justice or bringers of hope; rather, they're observers and scholars, defined by their domain of study. The lesser immortals are simply referred to as angels, while the higher orders have titles—virtues, dominions, and thrones. These higher angels are bound to the contemplation of a particular concept, based on their domain, and devote their existence to contemplating and understanding it. Some believe that it's through this contemplation that the concept continues to exist (though most inhabitants of other places—mortal and immortal alike—consider this to be highly unlikely). The appearance of Syranian angels is influenced by their domain, so the Dominion of Storms might be wreathed in lightning and have wings formed of storm clouds, while the Dominion of Trees could have bark for skin and moss for hair.": "西拉尼亚的本地居民是有翅膀的人形不朽者，统称为天使，不过他们在一些重要的方面与其他星球的天使不同。虽然他们被认为是天人，但西拉尼亚的大多数天使在排列上是中立的。他们不是正义的拥护者或希望的带来者；相反，他们是观察者和学者，由他们的研究领域决定。较小的不朽者被简单地称为天使，而较高的等级则有头衔--美德、领地和王座。这些高级天使根据他们的领域，被束缚在对某一特定概念的沉思上，并将他们的存在用于沉思和理解它。有些人认为，正是通过这种沉思，这个概念才得以继续存在（尽管其他地方的大多数居民--不朽的和不朽的--都认为这是很不可能的）。锡兰天使的外表受其领域的影响，因此风暴之域可能被闪电环绕，并有风暴云形成的翅膀，而树木之域可能有树皮作为皮肤，苔藓作为头发。",
	"Unlike lesser angels and visitors to Syrania, virtues, dominions, and thrones are immune to the effects of Syrania's Absolute Peace property, and are capable of taking aggressive action to defend Syrania, or when pursuing their domain—so a virtue of war could fight. However, they always try to find nonviolent or nonlethal solutions to threats.": "与小天使和西拉尼亚的访客不同，美德、领地和王座对西拉尼亚的绝对和平属性的影响是免疫的，并且能够采取攻击性行动来保卫西拉尼亚，或者在追求他们的领域时--所以战争美德可以战斗。然而，他们总是试图找到非暴力或非致命的解决方案来应对威胁。",
	"Angels are the least of the immortals of Syrania. They have no names or domains and are generally interchangeable; they serve as scribes and guides, performing minor tasks. They do not engage in combat and their statistics are largely inconsequential.": "天使是西拉尼亚的不朽者中最少的。他们没有名字或领域，通常可以互换；他们充当抄写员和向导，执行小任务。他们不参与战斗，他们的统计数字基本上是不重要的。",
	"Virtues are a higher order of angel, with names and broad domains—{@i Hazari, Virtue of Nature}. They act as assistants and emissaries of the dominions. Virtues spend much of their time contemplating their domain, but they also gather information for their dominions—either by fetching existing records within Syrania, talking with creatures who visit the plane, or by venturing beyond Syrania and discretely observing. A dominion is always aware of everything that happens to its virtues and immediately knows all information they collect. Virtues typically use the stat blocks of devas, and they change their forms to conceal their presence while gathering intelligence. The \"Syranian Domains\" sidebar provides examples of some domains; it's possible that a virtue might be able to cast a couple additional spells that are associated with their domain, though they'll not know the full list. They can only use commune to answer questions tied to their domain, and can cast {@spell plane shift} once per day, but only when acting in the direct service of a dominion.": "美德是一种更高层次的天使，有名字和广泛的领域--（%0%）。他们充当统治者的助手和使者。美德们大部分时间都在沉思他们的领域，但他们也为他们的统治者收集信息--或者通过获取西拉尼亚内部的现有记录，与访问这个位面的生物交谈，或者通过冒险到西拉尼亚之外进行谨慎的观察。一个统治者总是知道发生在其美德身上的一切，并立即知道他们收集的所有信息。美德们通常使用魔鬼的状态块，他们在收集情报时，会改变自己的形式来掩盖自己的存在。\"Syranian领域 \"侧边栏提供了一些领域的例子；一个美德有可能能够施展一些与他们的领域相关的额外法术，尽管他们不会知道完整的清单。他们只能用交流来回答与他们的领域相关的问题，每天可以施展（1%）一次，但只有在直接为一个统治者服务时才可以。",
	"Dominions focus on a very specific aspect of a single domain, like wolves or swords. They have names and specific domains, along with extra titles for pomp—{@i Tezaria, Angel of the Storm, Dominion of the Seventh Spire}. They typically spend their time in contemplation and use virtues as their eyes and hands, but occasionally a dominion acts directly—especially if its spire is threatened in some way. As neutral observers, dominions have no sympathy for mortals, but they're often willing to discuss their domain with a mortal who has an interesting perspective on it.": "支配国专注于单一领域的一个非常具体的方面，如狼或剑。他们有自己的名字和特定的领域，还有额外的头衔以示隆重--（%0%）。他们通常花时间沉思，用美德作为他们的眼睛和手，但偶尔一个统治者会直接采取行动--特别是如果它的尖顶受到某种威胁。作为中立的观察者，统治者对凡人没有同情心，但他们通常愿意与对其有有趣观点的凡人讨论他们的领域。",
	"It's important to recognize the difference between a warrior angel of Shavarath and a dominion of Syrania with the domain of War. The Shavaran is an angel who fights wars, and this has no place in peaceful Syrania. On the other hand, the dominion of Syrania—perhaps called the Angel of Swords—{@i understands} war, and in particular, knows everything there is to know about a single thing: swords. They know sword-fighting techniques from every mortal and immortal culture. They can recognize any sword, know the locations of a number of long-forgotten legendary blades, and may have a few in their possession. They're likely one of the deadliest swordfighters in existence, but they don't actually desire to fight, because that's not the point: they are the Angel of Swords, and they contemplate swords.": "重要的是要认识到沙瓦拉斯的战士天使和拥有战争领域的锡兰尼亚的统治者之间的区别。沙瓦兰是一个打仗的天使，这在和平的西拉尼亚没有地位。另一方面，西拉尼亚的统治者--也许被称为剑天使--{@i understands}战争，特别是知道关于一件事的一切：剑。他们知道每个凡人和仙人文化中的剑术。他们能认出任何剑，知道一些早已被遗忘的传奇剑的位置，并且可能拥有几把。他们可能是现存最致命的剑客之一，但他们实际上并不渴望战斗，因为这不是重点：他们是剑之天使，他们在思考剑。",
	"Dominions often use the statistics of a {@creature planetar}, substituting the spells and skills on the \"Syranian Domains\" sidebar; however, they maintain the ability to cast {@spell detect good and evil} and {@spell invisibility} at will, and use the latter to move unseen when observing on the Material Plane. Dominions might also possess additional abilities reflecting their absolute knowledge of their domain. For example, the Angel of Swords could be immune to any damage inflicted by a sword; perhaps they know perfectly how to defend against such an attack, or the sword itself might even refuse to strike them.": "主宰通常使用{@creature planetar}的统计数据，取代 \"Syranian Domains \"侧边栏上的法术和技能；然而，他们保持着随意施放{@spell detect good and evil}和{@spell invisibility}的能力，并且在物质界观察时使用后者来移动，不被发现。主宰也可能拥有额外的能力，反映他们对自己领域的绝对知识。例如，剑天使可以对剑造成的任何伤害免疫；也许他们完全知道如何抵御这种攻击，或者剑本身甚至可能拒绝攻击他们。",
	"Each virtue, dominion, and throne is dedicated to contemplation and mastery of a domain. Here are some example domains, along with skills and spells that any dominion or throne dedicated to it would likely have; virtues might also be able to cast a couple spells from their associated domain.": "每个美德、统治权和王位都致力于对一个领域的思考和掌握。以下是一些领域的例子，以及任何致力于该领域的统治权或王位可能拥有的技能和法术；美德也可能能够从其相关领域中施展一些法术。",

They largely remain in deep contemplation, acting only if Syrania itself is threatened or if a dominion succumbs to corruption. A throne has powers equal to or greater than a solar, though when using spells such as {@spell commune}, it can only answer questions tied to its domain. A throne also has access to the skills and spells on the \"Syranian Domains\" sidebar.

	"Rather than being divided into separate layers in the same way as many other planes, Syrania is comprised of crystal spires floating in the seemingly infinite void of the Open Sky.

	"The majority of spires aren't all that vast. Most are the seats of a dominion, who is attended by a few virtues and additional angels as needed. These have the general flavor of a library or museum, with additional facilities to allow the dominion to practice or study its subject. The spire of a dominion of nature has gardens, while the tower of a dominion of war has displays of armor and a dueling chamber.

So while it takes a significant time to travel between the farthest points, it is possible. There are no native threats in the Open Sky, and all visitors to Syrania have the ability to fly; the catch is knowing where to go, as there are hundreds of spires.": "开阔的天空是广袤的蓝色地带，蔚蓝的天空由此得名。清澈、明亮、没有阳光的天空没有显示出时间流逝的迹象；可以看到月亮特伦多尔，但它不移动或有相位。尽管 \"开放的天空 \"看起来空间无限，但它却环绕在自己身上，有效地使它成为一个300英里的立方体。因此，虽然在最远的地点之间旅行需要相当长的时间，但这是可能的。在开阔天空中没有本地的威胁，所有来到锡拉尼亚的人都有能力飞行；问题是要知道去哪里，因为有数百个尖塔。",
	"The pursuit of knowledge and education are things that flourish in times of peace. While most dominions are devoted to their own personal contemplation, the Throne of Knowledge maintains the University of Syrania, where chosen students can study an astonishing array of subjects with virtues of knowledge and the occasional guest dominion.

At the moment, the University only has twenty students, chosen from across the planes by roaming virtues.": "追求知识和教育是在和平时期蓬勃发展的事情。当大多数领地都致力于他们自己的沉思时，知识王座维持着锡拉尼亚大学，在那里被选中的学生可以学习一系列令人惊讶的学科，拥有知识的美德和偶尔的客座领地。问题是，学生需要被录取......而且实际上并没有申请的程序。目前，大学只有20名学生，由漫游的美德从各星球上挑选出来。",
	"For planar travelers who come to Syrania, the University is a good repository of general knowledge; if the scholarly virtues can't help, they'll likely know the way to a dominion that can. It's also an unusual background for a player character; perhaps a Divine Soul sorcerer unlocked their powers at the University, or perhaps a warlock's Celestial patron is their thesis advisor. And it's a very exotic option for a university group patron...": "对于来到西拉尼亚的星球旅行者来说，大学是一个很好的常识库；如果学者的美德不能提供帮助，他们很可能会知道去一个可以的领地的路。对于玩家角色来说，这也是一个不寻常的背景；也许一个神魂法师在大学里释放了他们的力量，也许一个术士的天体赞助人是他们的论文导师。而对于大学团体的赞助人来说，这也是一个非常奇特的选择......",
	"While most planes are isolated from others and it's difficult to move from one plane to another, commerce and peaceful interaction are defining aspects of Syrania. Most planes have back doors that lead to the Immeasurable Market. The crystal spire in the Open Sky is merely a gateway leading to an open marketplace that extends as far as the eye can see. To one side, a slaadi haggles with a modron over the price of hippogriff eggs; to the other, a sly dao shows a Shavaran balor a selection of Fernia-forged blades. It's said that anything you can imagine—and many things you can't—can be found in the Immeasurable Market.": "虽然大多数飞机与其他飞机隔离，并且很难从一个飞机移动到另一个飞机，但商业和和平互动是锡拉尼亚的决定性方面。大多数星球都有通往无量市场的后门。开阔天空中的水晶尖顶只是一个通向开放市场的大门，这个市场一直延伸到眼睛所能看到的地方。在一边，一个斯拉迪和一个莫德隆为河马蛋的价格讨价还价；在另一边，一个狡猾的道人向一个沙瓦兰的巴罗尔展示了一些费尔尼亚锻造的刀片。据说，你能想象到的任何东西--以及许多你无法想象的东西--都可以在无量市场找到。",
	"The Immeasurable Market includes customers and merchants from across the planes, including the Material Plane; there are a few back doors to the Market hidden on Eberron, and those who find them can make a healthy profit trading in exotic goods. It also includes a significant number of native immortals. Angels work as servers and porters, while virtues of commerce run small stands and shops. Dominions of commerce run the largest and most reliable businesses, while the Throne of Commerce monitors the entire Market and banishes troublemakers.": "无量市场包括来自各个位面的顾客和商人，包括物质位面；在Eberron有一些隐藏在市场的后门，找到它们的人可以在异域商品交易中获得丰厚的利润。它还包括相当数量的本地不朽者。天使担任服务员和搬运工，而商业美德则经营小摊位和商店。商业领地经营着最大和最可靠的生意，而商业王座则监控着整个市场并驱逐麻烦制造者。",
	"There are countless merchants in the Market.

	"Violence is forbidden in the Market, and thieves and other criminals are generally deported to Daanvi for judgment and punishment. While merchants always try to get the best deal, when dealing with immortal customers, your reputation is everything. Beyond this, oaths made in the Market carry great weight, and can be enforced in the courts of Daanvi; in the Immeasurable Market, your word truly is your bond. This is important, because most of the merchants aren't interested in gold, and goods and services usually involve barter. The {@table Immeasurable Currencies|ExploringEberron} table gives a few examples of things that can be used in trade, but this is just a starting point; the DM should feel free to come up with other offers.": "市场上禁止暴力，小偷和其他罪犯通常被驱逐到达安维进行审判和惩罚。虽然商人总是试图获得最好的交易，但在与不朽的顾客打交道时，你的声誉就是一切。除此之外，在市场上的誓言具有很大的分量，可以在达安维的法庭上强制执行；在无量市场，你的承诺就是你的保证。这一点很重要，因为大多数商人对黄金不感兴趣，而商品和服务通常涉及易货贸易。{@table Immeasurable Currencies|ExploringEberron}表给出了几个可以用于交易的例子，但这只是一个起点；管理员应该自由地提出其他提议。",
	"Here are some ways that Syrania affects the Material Plane.": "以下是锡拉尼亚影响物质界的一些方式。",
	"Manifest zones tied to Syrania can reflect one or more of the properties of the plane, but often in more limited ways. The manifest zone containing the city of Sharn has a lesser aspect of the Unburdened property; it doesn't grant flight, but it enhances effects that grant flight or levitation, enabling the skycoaches and flying buttresses that support the towers. A zone that has the Absolute Peace property might have a lower DC for the saving throw, or it might encourage peaceful behavior without actively enforcing it. Temples are often built on Syranian zones with the Absolute Peace property, while universities and House Sivis search for zones with the Universal Understanding property.": "与西拉尼亚相连的显灵区可以反映出飞机的一个或多个属性，但往往是以更有限的方式。含有沙恩城的显化区有一个较小的无负担属性；它不授予飞行，但它增强了授予飞行或浮空的效果，使支持塔楼的空中客车和飞行扶壁成为可能。一个拥有绝对和平属性的区域可能会有一个较低的蓄势待发的DC，或者它可能会鼓励和平行为而不积极地执行它。寺庙通常建在具有绝对和平属性的锡兰地区，而大学和西维斯家族则寻找具有普遍理解属性的地区。",
	"In addition to standard manifest zones, there are a few portals to the Immeasurable Market hidden in Eberron. These take many forms; a back door could be an actual door, a large chest, or a shallow pool of water. A back door only opens under specific circumstances: when opened with a special key, when used at a certain time, when blood is spilled, or when a heart is broken. Most who discover these portals jealously guard them; a merchant with access to the Immeasurable Market can acquire remarkable goods!": "除了标准的清单区，还有一些通往无量市场的门户隐藏在Eberron中。这些门户有多种形式；后门可以是一扇真正的门，一个大箱子，或者一个浅水潭。后门只有在特定情况下才会打开：用特殊的钥匙打开，在特定时间使用，洒下鲜血，或者心碎时。大多数发现这些门户的人都嫉妒地守护着它们；一个能够进入无量市场的商人可以获得非凡的货物！这就是所谓的 \"无量\"。",
	"When Syrania is coterminous, goodwill spreads across the world and people find it nearly impossible to contemplate violence. These periods brought welcome moments of peace during the Last War, and there are stories of enemy soldiers coming together to share stories or play games. During these times, the Absolute Peace and Gentle Thoughts properties apply across Eberron. However, if a creature is attacked, harmed by a spell, or witnesses its friends being harmed, that creature is unaffected by Absolute Peace for one minute. The influence of Syrania limits violence, but once conflicts break out, it can't stop them.": "当西拉尼亚共处时，善意在全世界蔓延，人们发现几乎不可能考虑到暴力。这些时期在最后的战争中带来了可喜的和平时刻，也有敌方士兵走到一起分享故事或玩游戏的故事。在这些时期，绝对和平和温柔思考的属性适用于整个Eberron。然而，如果一个生物被攻击，被法术伤害，或者目睹它的朋友被伤害，这个生物在一分钟内不会受到绝对和平的影响。西拉尼亚的影响限制了暴力，但一旦冲突爆发，它就无法阻止它们。",
	"While Syrania is coterminous, the skies are clear and the weather is calm—it's believed that if you're in a Syranian manifest zone during this time, it's possible to fly into the Open Sky simply by flying straight up to the edge of the sky. This may be apocryphal or only true in certain manifest zones... there's only one way to find out!": "当锡拉尼亚是同位素时，天空晴朗，天气平静--据说如果你在这段时间内身处锡拉尼亚的显灵区，只需直飞到天空的边缘，就有可能飞到开阔的天空。这可能是个传说，也可能只在某些显灵区是真的......只有一个办法可以找出答案",
	"When Syrania is remote, the skies are gray and the sun can't be seen. People feel quarrelsome and it's difficult to come to an understanding. Creatures have disadvantage on all Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks and advantage on Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) checks. Outside of Syranian manifest zones, all flying speeds are reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet.": "当Syrania偏远的时候，天空是灰色的，看不到太阳。人们感到争吵不休，很难达成共识。生物在所有魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中处于劣势，在魅力({@skill Intimidation})检查中处于优势。在Syranian manifest区之外，所有的飞行速度都会降低10英尺，最低为5英尺。",
	"Traditionally, Syrania is coterminous on the 9th day of the month of Rhaan, once every ten years. Followers of the Sovereign Host celebrate this day every year as Boldrei's Feast, a time for people to come together and resolve their grievances; the tenth-year coterminous celebrations are especially grand. Syrania is remote once every ten years on the same day, five years after the coterminous period. This day is still celebrated, as people make a conscious effort not to give into anger.": "传统上，Syrania在Rhaan月的第9天进行同治，每10年一次。主宰者的追随者们每年都会在这一天庆祝波德莱的节日，这是人们聚集在一起解决怨恨的时刻；十年一次的同城庆祝活动尤其隆重。西拉尼亚每十年在同一天被遥控一次，也就是在同年的五年后。这一天仍然被庆祝，因为人们有意识地努力不屈服于愤怒。",
	"Syrania's greatest treasure is the Immeasurable Market itself, with all manner of exotic goods available there. Many of the dominions of Syrania are more interested in collecting relics tied to their domain than in creating them, but there are a few who do both; the limits of what they can produce are tied to their domain.": "西拉尼亚最大的宝藏是无量市场本身，那里有各种奇异的商品。西拉尼亚的许多领地对收集与自己领地相关的遗物比创造这些遗物更感兴趣，但也有少数领地两者都做；他们所能生产的东西的限制与他们的领地有关。",
	"Other Syranian items are usually linked to the plane's universal properties. The power of Syrania enhances flight; there's a stall in the Market that sells {@item wings of flying} that resemble the wings of an angel. Things that encourage or enforce peace may come from Syrania, along with items that enhance a character's diplomatic ability.": "其他Syranian物品通常与飞机的通用属性有关。西拉尼亚的力量可以增强飞行能力；市场上有一个摊位出售类似于天使翅膀的（%0%）。鼓励或执行和平的东西可能来自锡拉尼亚，还有增强角色外交能力的物品。",
	"Wandering angels can stumble into any story, and the Immeasurable Market is a boon for adventurers lucky enough to find it. The Last Resort can be an interesting place for a powerful enemy to arrange a meeting; what safer place for neutral negotiations than on the plane of peace? Given the versatility and opportunities available in the Immeasurable Market, a DM may wish to limit access to Syrania; even if adventurers find a back door, it could open only at certain times or require a particular sacrifice.": "漂泊的天使可以偶然进入任何故事，而无量市场对有幸找到它的冒险者来说是个福音。对于强大的敌人来说，最后的胜地可以是一个有趣的地方，可以安排一次会面；对于中立的谈判来说，还有什么地方比在和平的平面上更安全？鉴于无量市场的多功能性和机会，管理员可能希望限制进入西拉尼亚；即使冒险者找到了后门，它也只能在特定的时间打开，或者需要特定的牺牲。",
	"After the adventurers acquire a curious object that defies any attempt to divine its powers and history, a hireling or observer is revealed to be a Syranian angel that's observing the adventurers. The item is a powerful extraplanar artifact; the virtue doesn't want to take it from them, but rather, to observe the effect it has on its bearer and the world around them. The virtue is the key to unlocking the powers of this powerful artifact... but how do the characters feel about being subjects of a celestial case study?": "在冒险者们获得了一件奇怪的物品，它让人无法猜测它的力量和历史，一个雇佣者或观察者被发现是一个正在观察冒险者的赛拉尼亚天使。该物品是一件强大的星外神器；该美德并不想从他们手中夺走它，而是想观察它对持有者和他们周围世界的影响。美德是解开这个强大神器的力量的关键......但是人物对成为天体案例研究的对象有什么感觉？",
	"The adventurers need to obtain a particularly obscure piece of information, and the only being that might possess it is a dominion of knowledge in Syrania. Can the adventurers find a way to reach the celestial's library spire? What does it want in exchange for its knowledge—and will the adventurers try to pay this price, or steal the information they need?": "冒险家们需要获得一个特别晦涩的信息，而唯一可能拥有它的存在是锡拉尼亚的一个知识统治者。冒险家们能否找到方法到达天人的图书馆尖顶？它想要什么来换取它的知识--冒险者们会尝试支付这个代价，还是偷取他们需要的信息？",
	"Syranian virtues sometimes travel to the Material Plane to conduct research for their dominion, concealing their true nature through magic or invisibility, and trying to minimize their interactions with mortals. Occasionally, a dominion wishes to experience the Material Plane for itself, perhaps pursuing a lead or studying a particularly interesting group of subjects. However, this venture can be quite dangerous, for even angels fall.": "锡兰人有时会到物质界为他们的统治区进行研究，通过魔法或隐身术隐藏他们的真实性质，并尽量减少与凡人的互动。偶尔，一个统治者希望亲自体验一下物质世界，也许是在追寻一条线索或研究一组特别有趣的课题。然而，这种冒险可能是相当危险的，因为即使是天使也会堕落。",
	"Many sages believe that touching Eberron's ground makes angels vulnerable to the influence of Khyber and the overlords, while others theorize that mortal worship—the positive energy that sustains the Undying Court—is like a drug to the dominions. Whatever the cause, dominions who interact with mortals run the risk of becoming corrupted. Such immortals crave mortal adoration and often seek to dominate mortals by exercising the power of their sphere.": "许多贤者认为，接触Eberron的地面使天使容易受到Khyber和霸主的影响，而其他人则推测，凡人崇拜--维持不朽之庭的正能量--对统治者来说就像毒品。不管是什么原因，与凡人互动的统治者都有被腐蚀的风险。这些不朽者渴望得到凡人的崇拜，并经常试图通过行使其领域的权力来支配凡人。",
	"Not all dominions fall prey to this corruption, but once one does, there seems to be no way to undo it. Even if the angel is destroyed and reforms, the corruption remains. It's unlikely that such an angel would be met in Syrania itself; typically, these corrupted angels are forever stripped of the power of flight and condemned to walk the Material Plane as {@creature radiant idol|ERLW|radiant idols}.": "并非所有的领地都会成为这种腐败的牺牲品，但一旦发生，似乎就没有办法挽回了。即使这个天使被摧毁并进行了改革，腐败仍然存在。这样的天使不太可能在西拉尼亚本身遇到；通常，这些被腐蚀的天使会永远被剥夺飞行的能力，并被谴责为在物质界行走的（%0%）。",
	"Every culture has faerie tales—stories that use exaggeration and supernatural elements to warn children of the consequences of bad behavior or to demonstrate the virtues of society. Breland tells tales of the Sleeping Prince, cursed to slumber by a cruel hag until he's saved by the courage of the Woodcutter's Daughter. In the Mror Holds, there's a tale older than Breland itself, in which Lady Narathun curses Doldarun's son with eternal sleep, until he's saved by humble Toldorath. And the Dhakaani dar have an ancient story about how Hezhaal—a dirge singer who betrayed the empire and studied sinister magic—cast the marhu's son into a cursed slumber, until he was saved by a simple golin'dar.": "每种文化都有精灵故事--用夸张和超自然的元素来警告孩子们不良行为的后果，或展示社会的美德。布雷兰德讲述了沉睡的王子的故事，他被一个残忍的巫婆诅咒沉睡，直到他被樵夫的女儿的勇气所拯救。在Moror Holds，有一个比Breland本身更古老的故事，其中Narathun女士诅咒Doldarun的儿子永远沉睡，直到他被谦逊的Toldorath所救。达卡尼达尔有一个古老的故事，说的是赫扎尔--一个背叛了帝国并学习邪恶魔法的哀歌歌手--把玛尔胡的儿子扔进了一个被诅咒的沉睡中，直到他被一个简单的戈林达尔救了出来。",
	"This is just one of many stories that appear over and over in different cultures. The exact details may shift—is the sleeper a prince? The marhu's son? Doldarun's heir?—while the thrust of the tale and the lessons it teaches persist. But long before any of these cultures arose, these stories existed somewhere else. In a layer of Thelanis, the Lady in Shadow curses a prince with eternal sleep. She tends a garden full of wonders, and keeps her own daughter hidden in the heart of a labyrinth of thorns. At the deepest level, that is what the fey are: stories. The dryad isn't a natural spirit; it's the magic we want in the world when we see a slender tree move in the wind and imagine it as a beautiful person. Thelanis is built on iconic stories, but it's also the Faerie Court; at its heart, satyrs and nymphs dance in the shadows of the Palace of the Moon, while the archfey engage in immortal intrigues. It's a fantastic realm essentially built around the idea of adventures, but it's a deadly place for those who refuse to understand its rules.": "这只是在不同文化中反复出现的许多故事中的一个。确切的细节可能会改变--睡觉的人是王子吗？玛尔胡的儿子？多尔达伦的继承人？--与此同时，故事的主旨和它所教导的道理却一直存在。但早在这些文化出现之前，这些故事就存在于其他地方。在Thelanis的某一层，阴影中的女士诅咒一位王子永远沉睡。她打理着一个充满奇迹的花园，并将自己的女儿藏在荆棘迷宫的中心。在最深的层次上，这就是精灵们的特点：故事。干尸不是一种自然的精神；当我们看到一棵细长的树在风中移动，并把它想象成一个美丽的人时，它就是我们想要的世界上的魔法。Thelanis建立在标志性的故事之上，但它也是精灵法庭；在它的核心，萨提尔和仙女在月宫的阴影下跳舞，而大法官们则从事不朽的阴谋活动。这是一个本质上围绕着冒险的想法而建立的梦幻王国，但对于那些拒绝理解其规则的人来说，这是一个致命的地方。",
	"Thelanis is one of the easiest planes for mortals to reach. Just walk through a mushroom ring when Rhaan is full in the sky, or follow the sound of distant music in the forest. It's not always this easy, but it can be. One wrong step and you could find yourself in Thelanis, retracing the steps of storybook heroes and making dangerous bargains with the rulers of the Faerie Court.": "Thelanis是凡人最容易到达的星球之一。只要在雷恩满天飞的时候穿过一个蘑菇圈，或者跟着森林里遥远的音乐声走就行了。并非总是如此简单，但它可以是。走错一步，你就会发现自己在Thelanis，追寻故事书中英雄的足迹，与精灵法庭的统治者进行危险的交易。",
	"Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.": "Thelanis是不可预测的，它的基本规则是，各层遵循自己的故事。请考虑以下属性。",
	"Saving throws against illusion or enchantment spells have disadvantage. When a creature casts an illusion or enchantment spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.": "对幻觉或魔咒的自救有劣势。当一个生物施展持续时间为1分钟或更长的幻术或魔法时，持续时间会加倍；持续时间为24小时或更长的法术不受影响。",
	"No two layers of Thelanis are exactly alike. Each is driven by its story, and any rule can be overridden by a particular tale. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent; in the Valley of Stolen Fire, all fire damage becomes cold damage. Ability checks using particular skills could have advantage or disadvantage. In one layer, spells that restore hit points might have no effect; in another, a glass of wine could act as a {@item potion of healing}. But while these effects vary from layer to layer, they are entirely reliable within that layer and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story.": "没有两层Thelanis是完全相同的。每一个都是由它的故事驱动的，任何规则都可以被一个特定的故事所推翻。伤害类型可以被调换或变得无能为力；在盗火谷，所有的火伤害都变成了冷伤害。使用特定技能的能力检查可以有优势或劣势。在某一层，恢复命中率的法术可能没有效果；在另一层，一杯酒可以作为（%0%）的作用。但是，虽然这些效果因层而异，但在该层内是完全可靠的，而且应该根据当地故事的性质感到合乎逻辑。",
	"In Thelanis, words—and particularly promises—have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise. The price varies, a slightly broken promise to a greater fey might simply result in a run of bad luck, with disadvantage on the next few rolls. On the other hand, a promise to an archfey could inherently carry the power of a geas. The fey themselves are bound by this restriction—though they are aware of it and are exceedingly careful with their promises.": "在Thelanis，语言--尤其是承诺--是有力量的。生物在签订任何形式的正式协议时都应该非常小心，尤其是与大精灵签订；越是强大的精灵，违背承诺的后果就越严重。代价各不相同，对一个大精灵的承诺稍有违背，可能就会导致厄运连连，在接下来的几次滚动中处于不利地位。另一方面，对一个大精灵的承诺可能本身就带有地煞的力量。妖怪们自己也受到这种限制的约束--尽管他们意识到了这一点，并对他们的承诺极为谨慎。",
	"Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from layer to layer. It's possible for adventurers to spend a night in Thelanis, then discover that a year has passed in Eberron. But it's equally possible for a group of adventurers to find a layer where they save a kingdom and reign as kings and queens... only to stumble through a gate many years later and discover that only an hour has passed in their homes. Often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron—either swiftly aging them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades of time spent in Thelanis.": "在Thelanis，时间是完全灵活的，以不同的速度从一层移动到另一层。冒险者有可能在Thelanis度过一个晚上，然后发现在Eberron已经过了一年。但同样有可能的是，一群冒险者找到了一个层，在那里他们拯救了一个王国，并作为国王和王后统治着......只是在许多年后偶然穿过一扇门，发现在他们的家里只过了一个小时。当凡人回到艾伯伦时，时间往往会追上他们--如果他们在物质世界的时间越长，他们就会迅速衰老，或者有可能恢复他们的青春，抹去在Thelanis度过的几十年时间。",
	"Thelanis is home to fey in all their forms. Sprites flit between trees, singing to the dryads that dwell within them. There are birds in the trees, and if you talk to them, one might answer—either a bird or a tree, depending on the story. Most of the denizens of Thelanis fall into one of four categories.": "Thelanis是各种形式的精灵的家园。精灵在树间飞舞，为住在树上的干尸唱歌。树上有鸟，如果你和它们说话，可能会有鸟或树回答，这取决于故事的内容。Thelanis的大多数居民都属于四种类型之一。",
	"The vast majority of the creatures of Thelanis—the sprites in the forest, the dryads, the birds, and for that matter, the trees themselves—are manifestations. These members of the supporting cast exist because the story needs them to exist, and they have a specific role to play. While most supporting cast are fey, any creature can appear if the story requires it. A pack of wolves? An angry giant? A white horse that appears just when it's needed? Anything is possible.": "Thelanis的绝大多数生物--森林中的精灵、干尸、鸟类，以及树木本身--都是表现形式。这些配角的存在是因为故事需要他们的存在，而且他们有一个特定的角色要扮演。虽然大多数配角是精灵，但如果故事需要，任何生物都可以出现。一群狼？一个愤怒的巨人？一匹在需要时出现的白马？一切皆有可能。",
	"Supporting cast generally use the standard stat blocks for each creature, though they might be considered fey instead of other creature types. These creatures don't think of themselves as manifestations; it's simply that they have no real depth, no desires other than the drives they need to fill their role in the story, and no care for the passage of time. The sprite never gets bored of its song, and it never stops to question anything about its existence.": "配角一般使用每个生物的标准状态块，尽管他们可能被认为是费伊而不是其他生物类型。这些生物不认为自己是显灵；只是他们没有真正的深度，除了他们需要填补故事中的角色的驱动力外，没有其他欲望，也不关心时间的流逝。魍魉永远不会对它的歌声感到厌烦，它也不会停下来质疑关于它的存在的任何事情。",
	"The supporting cast reflects the fact that the stories of Thelanis don't change. The hungry giant will always be guarding the well. If adventurers defeat the giant, they're the heroes of the hour and it feels like a triumph; but if they return to the barony at a later date, the giant will be back—or at least, a remarkably similar giant—and it won't remember them or acknowledge their previous victory. As a general rule, supporting cast can't abandon their posts or leave their layers.": "配角们反映了一个事实，即Thelanis的故事不会改变。饥饿的巨人将永远守在井边。如果冒险者打败了巨人，他们就是那个时代的英雄，感觉就像一场胜利；但如果他们以后再回到男爵府，巨人就会回来，或者至少是一个非常相似的巨人，它不会记得他们，也不会承认他们以前的胜利。作为一般规则，配角不能放弃他们的岗位或离开他们的层级。",
	"However, more than the manifestations of other planes, the supporting cast of Thelanis can evolve. When an anchor baron gives the white horse to an adventurer, it becomes a mortal horse and they can ride it home. Supporting cast that drift into manifest zones become mortal fey, dwelling in the zone until they die. A supporting cast member can also evolve by gaining a greater role in the story. An individual sprite doesn't even have a name, but if the adventureres convince the sprite to help them, and it plays a critical role in their defeat of the giant at the well, it's no longer a nameless sprice; it's Clever Jack, or whatever name they gave it. If a manifestation becomes mortal, it can go anywhere it likes, even leaving its layer and following the adventureres back to Eberron... but if it dies, it's gone forever. On the other hand, a manifestation can evolve to become a greater fey; if this happens, it remains immortal, and it's still tied to its story, just with a bigger role and more personality.": "然而，比起其他位面的表现形式，Thelanis的配角可以进化。当一个男爵把白马送给一个冒险者时，它就变成了一匹凡人的马，他们可以骑着它回家。漂流到显化区的配角会变成凡人的费伊，在该区居住直到死亡。配角也可以通过在故事中获得更大的作用而进化。一个单独的精灵甚至没有名字，但如果冒险者说服精灵帮助他们，并且它在他们击败井边的巨人时发挥了关键作用，它就不再是一个无名的精灵；它是聪明的杰克，或者他们给它起的任何名字。如果一个显灵变成了凡人，它可以去任何它喜欢的地方，甚至离开它的那一层，跟随冒险者回到Eberron......但如果它死了，它就会永远消失。另一方面，一个显现体可以进化成一个更大的精灵；如果发生这种情况，它仍然是不朽的，而且它仍然与它的故事联系在一起，只是有更大的作用和更多的个性。",
	"There are two types of mortals in Thelanis. The first are the supporting cast that have become real and split off from their original stories. The second are natural-born mortals who do have their own cultures and cities; chief among these are the eladrin, who dwell in the feyspires of the Moonlit Vale. Each spire is ruled by an archfey, and each has a distinct story that shapes the personality of the local eladrin. The eladrin aren't as bound by story as other fey, but the magic of the plane encourages a deep devotion to their spire and their ruler. They hunt, they hold revels, they serve their ruler in the intrigues of the Moon Court; it rarely occurs to them that there could be more to life. However, they're indeed mortals; they fall in love, they have children, they are born, and they die. If an eladrin leaves their spire—whether to roam across Thelanis or into Eberron—they often gain a greater appreciation of the passage of time. Living among mortals in a mundane world can be a hard transition for an eladrin; compared to the wonders of the Faerie Court, there is little fey beauty in Khorvaire. The longer an eladrin lives in the mortal world, the more mortal it becomes; this is why eladrin player characters are considered humanoids (and elves) rather than fey.": "在Thelanis有两种类型的凡人。第一种是已经成为现实的配角，并从他们原来的故事中分裂出来。第二种是天生的凡人，他们确实有自己的文化和城市；其中最主要的是居住在月光谷的精灵塔的精灵。每个塔尖都由一个大帝统治，每个塔尖都有一个独特的故事，塑造了当地精灵族的个性。埃拉德林并不像其他精灵那样被故事所束缚，但这个星球的魔法鼓励他们对自己的塔尖和统治者有深深的奉献精神。他们打猎，他们举行狂欢，他们在月宫的阴谋中为他们的统治者服务；他们很少想到生活中可能有更多的东西。然而，他们确实是凡人；他们坠入爱河，他们有孩子，他们出生，他们死亡。如果一个艾拉德林人离开了他们的塔尖--不管是在Thelanis还是在Eberron漫游--他们往往会对时间的流逝有更多的体会。在世俗世界的凡人中生活，对精灵族来说是一个艰难的过渡；与精灵王庭的奇迹相比，霍尔韦尔几乎没有什么精灵之美。艾拉德林人在凡人世界生活的时间越长，就越是凡人；这就是为什么艾拉德林人的玩家角色被认为是人类（和精灵）而不是费伊。",
	"For the eladrin of Thelanis, the seasonal aspect remains a statement of their current mood and nature. However, seasons are also used as a political statement, reflecting a degree of support for that season in the Moon Court; there may be times when an eladrin will resist assuming a particular aspect so as not to offend a host.": "对于Thelanis的Eladrin来说，季节性方面仍然是他们当前情绪和性质的声明。然而，季节也被用作一种政治声明，反映出月球法庭对该季节的支持程度；有时，为了不冒犯主人，精灵族人可能会拒绝承担一个特定的方面。",
	"The eladrin are the most common mortals in the layer, but there are also a handful of mortals who have been drawn in from Eberron—the gnomes of Pylas Pyrial, wandering Greensingers, mortals personally chosen by one of the archfey, or creatures who accidentally wandered through manifest zones and are trying to find their way home.": "埃拉德林是该层中最常见的凡人，但也有少数凡人被从埃伯龙吸引过来--皮拉斯-皮亚尔的地精、流浪的格林辛格人、被某位大帝亲自选中的凡人，或者意外地闯入显化区并试图找到回家之路的生物。",
	"Greater fey are tied to a barony or have a role in the Moonlit Vale, but they have their own names, identities, and distinct personalities. They can have their own agendas and schemes within the grander story of the archfey, seeking love or revenge or other ambitions. Sometimes the protagonist of the story appears as a greater fey; in the case of the Sleeping Prince, perhaps the adventurers can actually meet the clever Woodcutter's Daughter. However, often the role of protagonist is left for the adventurers to fill; in Thelanis, {@i they} are the ones who must wake the Sleeping Prince.": "大精灵与一个男爵相联系，或在月光谷有一个角色，但他们有自己的名字、身份和独特的个性。他们在大精灵的宏大故事中可以有自己的议程和计划，寻求爱情、复仇或其他野心。有时，故事的主角会以更大的精灵出现；在《沉睡的王子》中，也许冒险家们可以真正见到聪明的樵夫之女。然而，主角的角色往往是留给冒险者来扮演的；在Thelanis，{@i they}是必须唤醒沉睡王子的人。",
	"Despite their individuality, these greater fey are still fey; they remain attached to their layers, and don't experience the passage of time as mortals do. They want to achieve things within their story, but few have any thoughts or desires that go beyond Thelanis. However, it's possible for them to go wherever they want. A greater fey could establish its own domain in a manifest zone tied to Thelanis, or be found selling strange trinkets in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania. When greater fey do leave Thelanis, they generally seek to create their own stories; they still want to be part of a narrative that makes sense to them.": "尽管他们有自己的个性，但这些大费伊人仍然是费伊人；他们仍然依附于他们的层次，不像凡人那样经历时间的推移。他们想在自己的故事中实现一些东西，但很少有人有超越Thelanis的想法或欲望。然而，他们也有可能去他们想去的地方。一个大精灵可以在与忒拉尼斯相连的显化区建立自己的领域，或者在锡拉尼亚的无量市场上出售奇怪的饰品。当大精灵离开塞拉尼斯时，他们通常会寻求创造自己的故事；他们仍然希望成为对他们有意义的叙述的一部分。",
	"Any fey creature can be used as a basic foundation for a greater fey, possibly with additional powers tied to the story they tell. A greater dryad might be able to see through all of the trees in the manifest zone she calls home, and to control its beasts. This isn't represented by a spell, as she couldn't control beasts in other places; it's simply part of the story.": "任何精灵生物都可以作为大精灵的基本基础，可能还有与它们所讲述的故事相关的额外力量。一个更伟大的干尸可能能够看透她称之为家的显化区的所有树木，并能控制其野兽。这不是用法术来表示的，因为她不能控制其他地方的野兽；这只是故事的一部分。",
	"As the story of a greater fey grows, its abilities can grow as well... but these are often tied to storybook logic, and power could be balanced by a weakness. A greater dryad could be immune to fire unless someone knows her name, at which point she is vulnerable to it. Or she might be immune to piercing damage but vulnerable to slashing damage—arrows and spears refuse to strike her, but axes hunger to cut her down.": "随着大精灵故事的发展，它的能力也可以增长......但这些往往与故事书的逻辑相联系，力量可以通过弱点来平衡。一个伟大的干尸可能对火免疫，除非有人知道她的名字，在这一点上她很容易受到影响。或者她可能对穿刺伤害免疫，但对切割伤害却很脆弱--箭和长矛拒绝攻击她，但斧头却渴望将她砍倒。",
	"The archfey are the foundation of Thelanis, the force that sets a story in motion. Where greater fey may be tied to a single story, most archfey have inspired countless tales—often as the antagonist, though they can also be benevolent. The Lady in Shadow is the archetype of the mighty witch who lives apart from society, whose anger can bring a terrible curse. She's the villain of the Sleeping Prince, but she also curses those who steal from her secret garden, and may have advice for those who approach her carefully and with gifts. In some cases, stories refer to the archfey by name. When something goes missing in the Five Nations, people in Eberron know the Forgotten Prince stole it; his story is explored in chapter 8. Other archfey inspire tales, but those stories are seen through a local lens. The Lady in Shadow set the story of the Sleeping Prince in motion long ago, but in Eberron, the villain of the story is Lady Narathun, or Hezhaal the dirge singer, or Sora Katra. This is fine with the Lady in Shadow; she doesn't need mortals to know her name.": "弓箭手是Thelanis的基础，是推动故事发展的力量。更大的精灵可能只与一个故事有关，而大多数大精灵则激发了无数的故事--通常是作为对立面，尽管他们也可以是善意的。阴影中的女士是强大的女巫的原型，她生活在社会之外，她的愤怒会带来可怕的诅咒。她是《沉睡的王子》中的反派，但她也诅咒那些从她的秘密花园里偷东西的人，并可能对那些小心翼翼地接近她并带着礼物的人有建议。在某些情况下，故事中提到了大主教的名字。当五国的东西丢失时，Eberron的人们知道是被遗忘的王子偷了它；他的故事在第八章中进行了探讨。其他大法官也激发了一些故事，但这些故事是通过当地的视角来看的。阴影中的女士很早就开始了沉睡王子的故事，但在Eberron，故事的反派是Narathun女士，或哀歌者Hezhaal，或Sora Katra。这对阴影中的女士来说很好；她不需要凡人知道她的名字。",
	"Many archfey dwell in the Moonlit Vale. Some rule over feyspires, while others dwell in the Palace of the Moon; the intrigues of the Court aretheir defining stories. Archfey that rule layers are known as anchor barons, as each is the anchor that defines the barony. They come to the Palace of the Moon for revels or conclaves, but prefer to dwell in their own story.": "许多大法官居住在月光谷中。有些人统治着翡冷翠，有些人则居住在月宫；宫廷的阴谋是他们的决定性故事。统治层的大法师被称为 \"锚 \"男爵，因为每个人都是定义男爵的锚。他们来到月宫参加狂欢或会议，但更喜欢住在自己的故事里。",
	"Archfey possess great power within Thelanis and its manifest zones, but to act in the world beyond, they need agents. Some recruit agents directly, working with Greensingers or training warlocks or other emissaries; an archfey could serve as an immortal group patron for a group of adventurers. Typically, an archfey wants its agents to take actions relating to its story; the Forgotten Prince charges his agents to steal secrets and unloved things. Others don't want agents; they want mortals to reenact their stories, as in many versions of the Sleeping Prince. Hezhaal the dirge singer really did curse the marhu's son long ago, and Sora Katra is another real person who just happens to resemble the Lady in Shadow in some ways. Neither Katra nor Hezhaal knowingly served the Lady in Shadow—but she may have secretly aided them, or placed gifts or obstacles in their paths that might make them reenact the stories, unknowingly becoming avatars of the archfey. Archfey can't be permanently killed; as long as their stories are told, the archfey will reform. However, this usually involves a greater fey being promoted to fill the role; the archfey still exists, but they aren't exactly the same as the one that came before.": "大祭司在塞拉尼斯和它的显化区拥有强大的力量，但要在外面的世界行动，他们需要代理人。有些人直接招募代理人，与绿心人一起工作，或训练术士或其他使者；大帝可以作为一群冒险者的不朽团体赞助人。通常情况下，大主教希望其代理人采取与其故事有关的行动；被遗忘的王子责成其代理人偷窃秘密和不受欢迎的东西。还有一些大法师不想要代理人；他们想要凡人重演他们的故事，就像许多版本的《沉睡的王子》。哀歌者Hezhaal在很久以前确实诅咒过marhu的儿子，而Sora Katra是另一个真实存在的人，只是碰巧在某些方面与影中人相似。Katra和Hezhaal都不知道为影中人服务，但她可能秘密地帮助他们，或在他们的道路上放置礼物或障碍，使他们重演这些故事，不知不觉地成为大帝的化身。大法师不能被永久地杀死；只要他们的故事被讲述，大法师就会改过自新。然而，这通常涉及到一个更大的精灵被提升来填补这个角色；大精灵仍然存在，但他们与之前的那个不完全一样。",
	"Chapter 8 includes two archfey, the Forest Queen and the Forgotten Prince, along with descriptions of their layers, their goals, and how they can assist adventurers—or oppose them. Additional archfey are mentioned in the {@table Archfey of Thelanis|ExploringEberron} table, just a few examples of the dozens in Thelanis. In creating new archfey, consider the stories that are told about them and how those stories could play out again in the current campaign.": "第八章包括两位大主教，即森林女王和被遗忘的王子，以及对他们的层级、目标以及他们如何协助冒险者--或反对他们的描述。在{@table Archfey of Thelanis|ExploringEberron}表中提到了其他的大主教，这只是Thelanis中几十个大主教中的几个例子。在创建新的大主教时，要考虑关于他们的故事，以及这些故事如何在当前的活动中再次上演。",
	"Much like Kythri, Dal Quor, and Syrania, Thelanis has a core layer surrounded by lesser layers. The heart of Thelanis is the Moonlit Vale, where all archfey gather for their revels. This is surrounded by endless baronies, each embodying the stories of a particular archfey. While eladrin and fey can shift between layers, it's more challenging for mortals to travel to a barony; this often requires a token from that realm, or for the mortals to act out some aspect of its story.": "与凯瑟里（Kythri）、达尔奎尔（Dal Quor）和西拉尼亚（Syrania）一样，忒拉尼斯也有一个核心层，周围有一些较小的层。Thelanis的中心是月光谷，所有的大主教都会在这里举行狂欢。它被无尽的男爵领地所包围，每个领地都体现了一个特定的大帝的故事。虽然埃拉德林和费伊可以在各层之间转换，但对于凡人来说，前往一个男爵领地则更具挑战性；这通常需要一个来自该领域的信物，或者由凡人来扮演其故事的某些方面。",
	"Regardless of the specific identity of a layer, Thelanis always feels magical and otherworldy. Its environments are typically vibrant and beautiful, but if they are harsh and ugly, they are exceptionally so. It feels like a story, exaggerated and unreal.": "无论某一层的具体身份如何，Thelanis总是给人以神奇和另类的感觉。它的环境通常是充满活力和美丽的，但如果它们是严酷和丑陋的，它们也是特别的。这感觉就像一个故事，夸张而不真实。",
	"This is the largest layer of Thelanis and the heart of the plane. The Moonlit Vale is essentially a country, with the feyspires spread across it as cities; it's possible to spend days traveling from spire to spire. While it's largely arboreal, there are beautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. It's always night here, and the moon Rhaan radiates bright light, always seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon doesn't move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court is covered in snow, while in spring, it's in brilliant flower. This has nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to do with the intrigues of the Palace of the Moon; the current season indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant. This is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: {@i things change}. The baronies are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the four seasons are the story Thelanis tells itself.": "这是塞拉尼斯最大的一层，也是飞机的中心。月光谷本质上是一个国家，精灵们像城市一样分布在这里；有可能花几天时间从一个尖塔到另一个尖塔。虽然这里大部分是树丛，但也有美丽的山谷、闪亮的湖泊和一座巨大的山。这里永远是夜晚，月亮Rhaan散发着明亮的光芒，似乎总是悬挂在观众的上方。虽然月亮不会移动或变化，但季节却会；在冬天，宫廷被雪覆盖，而在春天，它的花朵灿烂。这与时间的流逝无关，而与月宫的阴谋诡计有关；当前的季节表明哪个季节的宫廷目前占主导地位。这是月光谷的一个重要方面：（%0%）。各个男爵的故事是固定的，但四季的阴谋是Thelanis自己讲的故事。",
	"The Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the fey—otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of illusion—streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The beasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual colors and patterns; while many use standard stat blocks, sentient beasts might use the statistics for Valenar beasts from {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} (though these aren't in any way related to the Tairnadal). The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have advantage on foraging checks... though hunting without permission may incur the wrath of the local fey.": " 这里有许多自然的幻觉展示--发光的雾流、空灵的音乐、遥远的歌曲。光芒在树丛中缓缓飘动。该地区的野兽圆滑而优雅，有不寻常的颜色和图案；虽然许多野兽使用标准的状态块，但有生命的野兽可能使用{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}的瓦伦纳人野兽的统计数据（尽管这些与泰尔纳达尔人没有任何关系）。这片土地很肥沃，猎物很容易猎取，冒险者在觅食检查上有优势......不过未经许可的狩猎可能会招致当地精灵的愤怒。",
	"The grandest city in the Moonlit Vale is the Palace of the Moon. Its towers are built into the trunks of four vast trees, each one reflecting the influence of a particular season. The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer. At the apex of each season—perhaps a strangely arbitrary declaration in a realm with such a casual relationship to time—the fey of the ruling season host a grand revel, which draws archfey from all throughout the plane; this is a moment when intrigues bloom and stories are shaped, a time for duels and grand declarations.": "月光谷中最宏伟的城市是月宫。它的塔楼建在四棵大树的树干上，每棵树都反映了一个特定季节的影响。夏天的树盛开着，而冬天的树则枯萎着，光秃秃的。四个季节是月宫的精灵中的派别，住在宫殿里的人住在他们季节的树里。宫殿里充满了无尽的阴谋，使节们在谈判中与费斯皮尔和锚男爵结成联盟。对凡人来说，这些阴谋很多都显得微不足道和奇怪，但对费伊人来说，它们决定了统治的季节，这为这一层定下了基调。在每个季节的顶点，也许是一个奇怪的任意声明，在一个与时间关系如此随意的领域里，统治季节的费伊人举办了一个盛大的狂欢，吸引了来自整个平面的大费者；这是一个阴谋绽放和故事形成的时刻，一个决斗和盛大声明的时刻。",
	"The feyspires are the cities of the Moonlit Vale. Each is home to a single archfey whose personal story is reflected by the spire, along with a few greater fey and a host of eladrin and other mortals. Many feyspires serve as planar beachheads; they are tied to specific manifest zones in Eberron, and when the time is right, they can slip into Eberron for a short time. Usually the feyspires are hidden by powerful illusions during these times, but there are stories of people stumbling into magical cities that are gone the next day. In fourth edition, the {@i Eberron Campaign Guide} explored the idea that feyspires could be trapped in Eberron following the Mourning; it's up to a DM to decide if that's the story they want to tell. Here are a few notable feyspires:": "翡冷翠是月光谷的城市。每座城市都有一位大公爵，他的个人故事反映在尖塔上，还有一些大公爵和大量的伊拉德林和其他凡人。许多仙人尖塔作为平面滩头堡；它们与Eberron的特定显现区联系在一起，当时机成熟时，它们可以短时间内溜进Eberron。通常情况下，在这些时间里，仙境会被强大的幻象所掩盖，但也有一些故事，人们偶然进入魔法城市，但第二天就消失了。在第四版中，{@i Eberron Campaign Guide}探讨了在哀悼之后，费斯派可能被困在Eberron的想法；至于这是否是他们想讲的故事，则由DM决定。这里有几个值得注意的费斯皮尔。",
	"is the Gate of Joy, celebrated for its bards and revels. Tied to Zilargo, it has a significant gnome population.": "是欢乐之门，以其吟游诗人和狂欢而闻名。它与兹拉尔戈相连，拥有大量的地精人口。",
	"is the City of Emerald Lights; its illusionists are legendary. It appears in what is now Darguun.": "是翡翠灯之城；它的幻术师是传奇性的。它出现在现在的Darguun。",
	"is the City of Rose and Thorn, an arboreal spire frequently found in the Twilight Demesne of the Eldeen Reaches. Many Greensingers have close ties to this city.": "是玫瑰与荆棘之城，一个经常在Eldeen Reaches的Twilight Demesne发现的树状尖塔。许多绿心人与这座城市有着密切的联系。",
	"is the City of Silver and Bone. Tied to Xen'drik, it was sacked by the giants of the Cul'sir Dominion and never reclaimed; some believe the elves of Eberron are descended from the eladrin of Shae Tirias Tolai. Today, it's a haunted ruin, shunned by the fey.": "是银骨之城（City of Silver and Bone）。它与Xen'drik联系在一起，被Cul'sir统治区的巨人洗劫一空，从未被收回；有人认为Eberron的精灵是Shae Tirias Tolai的Eladrin的后代。今天，它是一个闹鬼的废墟，被精灵们避之不及。",
	"is the Court of the Silver Tree, largest of the feyspires. Its ruler, Shan Tira, is a master diviner and gifted oracle. All archfey respect her words, and she serves as a mediator between the seasons of the Moon Court. The spire is tied to Cyre, and there are stories that suggest the first Princess Cyre herself may have been a student of Shan Tira.": "是银树之庭，最大的费城。其统治者山提拉是一位占卜大师和有天赋的神谕。所有的大法师都尊重她的话，她也是月宫四季之间的调解人。这座尖塔与赛尔联系在一起，有故事表明第一位赛尔公主本人可能是山提拉的学生。",
	"is the Winter Citadel, seat of the Prince of Frost. This martial spire appears in a barren region of Karrnath. It's closely allied with the winter fey of the Moon Court.": "是冬季城堡，冰霜王子的所在地。这个武功高强的尖塔出现在卡尔纳特的一个荒芜地区。它与月宫的冬日精灵们紧密相连。",
	"Each barony is a collection of layers that embody the stories of their anchor baron. Only one archfey is found in each barony, and it is a serious transgression for another archfey to enter a barony uninvited, as their presence disrupts the story. Each barony is unique, but the layers are often quite small, reflecting the events of a familiar tale... though not all of the stories of Thelanis are known to every culture in Khorvaire! A few are described below, but there are many more.": "每个男爵区都是一层层的集合，体现了他们的主男爵的故事。每个男爵区只有一个大主教，另一个大主教不请自来进入男爵区是一种严重的违法行为，因为他们的存在会扰乱故事。每个男爵领地都是独一无二的，但其层次往往相当小，反映了一个熟悉的故事的事件......尽管并非所有Thelanis的故事都为Khorvaire的每一种文化所熟知 下面介绍了几个，但还有很多。",
	"The Endless Weald and the Castle of Forgotten Things are described in chapter 8; these are the baronies of the Forest Queen and the Forgotten Prince.": "第八章描述了无尽荒原和被遗忘的城堡；这些是森林女王和被遗忘的王子的男爵领地。",
	"The Assembly is the barony of the Forge Maiden. Here, innovation is celebrated, and any artificer spell cast in this layer is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. But while there are a few stories of how things go well, there are many where inventions go terribly wrong: the construct dragon that has claimed the workshop and gathered a hoard; the labyrinth the Maiden designed so well that she became lost in it; the {@spell time stop} spell that can't be undone. Wondrous (and impossible) artifacts can be found here, but so can many dangers.": "大会是锻造少女的男爵区。在这里，创新受到赞誉，任何在这一层施展的工匠法术都被视为比所消耗的法术槽高一级的施法。但是，虽然有一些事情进展顺利的故事，但也有许多发明出了大错的故事：夺取了工场并聚集了大量囤积物的构装龙；少女设计的迷宫如此出色，以至于她在其中迷失了方向；无法解除的（%0%）咒语。这里可以找到神奇（和不可能）的文物，但也有许多危险。",
	"The Shadow is the barony of the Lady in Shadow, with branches reflecting the many tales of this sinister figure. It includes a tiny kingdom, which serves as the set for the Sleeping Prince and similar tales; the kingdom is often named Whitestone, though this can change. The secret garden of the Lady is walled and protected by dangerous plant creatures, but holds imaginary flowers that an alchemist could use to do amazing things. The Lady's tower is hidden within a maze of thorns. Any story dealing with a sinister spellcaster dwelling on the edge of civilization could be found here.": "阴影是阴影中的女士的男爵，其分支反映了这个阴险人物的许多故事。它包括一个小王国，作为沉睡王子和类似故事的背景；这个王国通常被命名为白石，尽管这可能会改变。夫人的秘密花园有围墙，受到危险的植物生物的保护，但却有想象中的花朵，炼金术士可以用它来做一些惊人的事情。夫人的塔楼隐藏在一个荆棘的迷宫里。任何涉及到居住在文明边缘的阴险的施法者的故事都可以在这里找到。",
	"Folly is the barony of Fortune's Fool. Here, great misfortunes regularly occur, but invariably lead to unlikely success. In this layer, d20 rolls of 5 or below are always considered a 1, and rolls of 16 or above are always considered a 20. Folly contains a charming village and a number of threats—a dragon, a giant—that can't be defeated with weapons alone. However, skill checks can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it may take time for the adventurers to discover this.": "愚蠢是 \"财富傻瓜 \"的男爵区。在这里，巨大的不幸经常发生，但无一例外地导致了不可能的成功。在这一层，5或以下的D20卷总是被认为是1，而16或以上的卷子总是被认为是20。福莱包含一个迷人的村庄和一些威胁--一条龙，一个巨人--单靠武器是无法战胜的。然而，技能检查可以用来实现一些在现实中看起来不可能的事情。例如，每一次劝说或欺骗检查都可以用来说服龙吃掉自己的囤积物，每一次检查成功都会减少它的命中率，直到它爆体而亡。这是一个智慧比体力更重要的地方，尽管冒险者们可能需要时间来发现这一点。",
	"Here are a few ways Thelanis can affect the world.": "以下是Thelanis影响世界的几种方式。",
	"More than with any other plane, Thelanian manifest zones often allow travel between the planes. Fey creatures dwell in such zones, and a greater fey may turn such a manifest zone into its personal domain. Just as fey can cross over from Thelanis, mortals can travel to the Faerie Court. Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it's rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway—circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times—often when the moon Rhaan is full—and even then, there's usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won't stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That's on you.": "比起其他任何位面，Thelanian的显化区通常允许位面之间的旅行。费伊生物居住在这样的区域，而更大的费伊可以把这样的显化区变成它的个人领域。就像费伊人可以从Thelanis穿越一样，凡人也可以前往精灵宫。通路区总是与它们所连接的那一层共享一般的环境，尽管这种穿越发生的时间很少很明显，而且旅行者可能需要一段时间才能意识到他们已经穿越了。然而，总是有网关的迹象--一圈圈的蘑菇、奇怪的植被图案、阴森的灯光，或者微弱的、非人间的音乐，冒险者必须跟随。网关通常只在特定时间激活--通常是在月亮Rhaan满月的时候--即使如此，通常也有一些必须要做的事情，违反了已知的迷信。如果你呆在森林里的小路上，你就不会误入无尽荒原。但如果你跟着鬼魂的音乐走，或者追赶银色的鹿？那就是你的事了。",
	"Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word—and if you are false, you'll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove... will you?": "其他表现区反映了Thelanis的属性和影响，但不允许世界间的通行。具有魔法境界属性的区域是皮亚伦家族和瑟兰尼家族所追求的。具有故事书逻辑的区域以特定的方式打破了现实的规则；承诺之林是一片空地，里面有一个古老的石制喷泉。附近村庄的故事说，如果你对某人做出承诺，然后分享喷泉的水，你必须遵守你的承诺--如果你是假的，你会生病和死亡。镇上的人在树林里举行婚礼。年轻的恋人偷偷摸摸地把他们的心许给别人。甚至有商人喜欢在树林里完成他们的交易。镇上的人从不违背在树林中宣誓的承诺...你会吗？",
	"A final form of manifest zone is the beachhead; this phenomenon periodically draws a piece of Thelanis into Eberron. The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location—sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There's a tale in the Mror Holds of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, bestowing curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen... or until they die.": "最后一种表现形式是滩头；这种现象会定期将Thelanis的一部分吸引到Eberron。前面提到的翡冷翠就是一个例子，但滩头堡可以是任何不寻常的地方--肯定是当地的一个传说，但很少被寻找它的人发现，只是被偶然发现。在Mror Holds有一个关于被遗忘的国王之墓的故事，当一个旅行者在山洞里寻求庇护并发现了更深的通道时被发现。沿着这些通道，他们发现自己在一座古墓中。墙壁上镶嵌着珠宝。硬币堆在桌子上，洒落在地板上。在故事的某些版本中，守护者在墓中巡逻，他们是石头和金属的精灵。在其他版本中，则有致命的陷阱。但有一个细节在所有的故事中都是相同的：从坟墓中取出的宝物总是带来不幸，赋予诅咒，直到小偷再次找到坟墓并归还他们所偷的东西......或者直到他们死亡。",
	"When Thelanis is coterminous, new gateway zones spring up. Mischievous or cruel fey may cross over, and it's far easier for careless travelers to cross over. However, there are always warning signs, and you generally must break some superstition or taboo to be pulled through. Thus, when people know the planes are coterminous, they are cautious to remember the stories and avoid foolish behavior.": "当Thelanis被同化时，新的门户区就会出现。顽皮或残忍的费伊人可能会穿越，而粗心的旅行者也更容易穿越。然而，总是有警告标志，而且一般必须打破一些迷信或禁忌才能被拉过去。因此，当人们知道飞机是同向的，他们会谨慎地记住这些故事，避免愚蠢的行为。",
	"When Thelanis is remote, the effects of Thelanian manifest zones are suppressed. Fey creatures may be temporarily drawn back to Thelanis, even those that normally dwell on Eberron. In general, the world feels less magical.": "当Thelanis处于远程状态时，Thelanian显化区的效果会被抑制。费伊生物可能会被暂时吸引回忒拉尼斯，即使是那些通常居住在埃伯龙的生物。总的来说，这个世界感觉没有那么神奇。",
	"Traditionally, Thelanis becomes coterminous for a period of 7 years every 225 years, and it is remote for 7 years halfway between these cycles. However, there is evidence, such as beachheads remaining in place longer than usual, that something has disrupted this cycle. This may be a result of the Mourning... or it could be that the Mourning is just an easy excuse, and the true story is tied to the schemes of an archfey or a mortal mastermind. Nonetheless, no one knows when Thelanis will become coterminous again—or how long the phase might last when it does.": "传统上，Thelanis每225年就会有7年的时间成为同位素，而在这两个周期之间，它有7年的偏僻时间。然而，有证据表明，比如滩头的停留时间比平时长，有什么东西破坏了这个周期。这可能是哀悼的结果......也可能是哀悼只是一个简单的借口，而真正的故事是与一个大帝或凡人的阴谋联系在一起。尽管如此，没有人知道Thelanis何时会再次成为同城，或者当它发生时，这个阶段会持续多久。",
	"Thelanis can be a source of wondrous magical items. The simplest deal with illusion or enchantment: {@item eyes of charming} or a {@item hat of disguise}. But any sort of magic item can come from Thelanis—the catch is that Thelanian items invariably have a story attached to them. The {@item berserker axe} that can't be released until it kills someone you love. The {@item dragon slayer} that calls out to dragons, summoning wyverns for you to fight and drawing the attention of agents of the Chamber. The {@item crystal ball} that occasionally shows glimpses of things you don't want to know.": "Thelanis可以是一个神奇的魔法物品的来源。最简单的是幻觉或魔法：（%0%）或（%1%）。但任何类型的魔法物品都可以来自Thelanis--问题是Thelanis的物品总是有一个附带的故事。在杀死你所爱的人之前，不能释放的（%2%）。召唤龙的{@item dragon slayer}，为你召唤狼獾来战斗，并引起商会特工的注意。偶尔会露出你不想知道的东西的（%%4%）。",
	"Thelanian items can also hold curses that come with no accompanying benefit. The {@i mithral falcon} is a statue that amplifies existing greed.

	"Whether serving as patron for a warlock or an entire party, an archfey could work with adventurers, providing magical benefits—perhaps spells from the artificer or bard lists, or boons and magic items—in exchange for the character's services. It could be that the patron's goals are tied to the intrigues of the Moon Court or to some element of its story. It might want the characters to deal with the warlock agents of another archfey. Or it could be that the archfey is trying to get the adventurers to reenact its story in the present day, to have a character serve as an avatar for the archfey—or as the avatar for one of its enemies.": "无论是作为一个术士还是整个队伍的赞助人，大法官都可以与冒险者合作，提供魔法利益--也许是工匠或吟游诗人名单上的法术，或者是恩赐和魔法物品--以换取角色的服务。赞助人的目标可能与月宫的阴谋或其故事的某些元素有关。它可能希望角色与另一个大主教的术士代理人打交道。也可能是大主教想让冒险者在今天重演它的故事，让一个角色作为大主教的化身，或者作为它的一个敌人的化身。",
	"You don't have to be a warlock to draw powers from an archfey. An artificer could have been blessed by the Forge Maiden; their artifice isn't arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things. A barbarian's rage could be a curse from the Lady in Shadow, laid upon an ancestor and handed down through generations. All other members of the character's family have eventually been killed by their fury; does the barbarian seek to break the curse, or do they just want to live as wild a life as possible before it consumes them?": "你不一定非得是个术士才能从大法师那里获得力量。一个工匠可能得到了锻造少女的祝福；他们的工匠并不是奥术科学，他们只是创造了不可能的、异想天开的东西。野蛮人的愤怒可能是阴影中的女士的诅咒，施加在一个祖先身上并世代相传。这个人物的家族其他成员最终都被他们的怒火杀死了；野蛮人是想打破这个诅咒，还是只想在诅咒吞噬他们之前尽可能地过上狂野的生活？",
	"The archfey and the baronies are the source of faerie tales. You can draw from beloved tales in our own world to craft any adventure, adding an Eberron twist. Using these tropes gives the players a sense of familiarity with the story, just as the people of Eberron are familiar with these archetypal tales, played out time and time again across cultures and generations. So, the Sleeping Prince clearly follows the same basic principles as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, but with an Eberron twist—it's Sora Katra and the prince of Breland!": "大主教和男爵是精灵故事的来源。你可以从我们自己的世界里心爱的故事中汲取灵感，来制作任何冒险，并加入Eberron的元素。使用这些套路让玩家对故事有一种熟悉感，就像Eberron的人们熟悉这些典型的故事一样，这些故事在不同的文化和时代中一次次上演。因此，沉睡的王子显然遵循了与睡美人或白雪公主相同的基本原则，但却有一个Eberron的转折点--它是索拉-卡特拉和布雷兰德的王子!",
	"As a child, any character could have wandered through a manifest zone, stumbled into a feyspire, or even caught the eye of an archfey and been carried off to Thelanis. A bard could have learned their craft in Pylas Pyrial. A druid's abilities might be tied less to nature and more to the magic of the fey. It might be that a warlock doesn't have a patron, but they're the adopted child of the Lady in Shadow and learned her tricks by watching her. If this is the case, is the character welcome to one day return to Thelanis, or were they cast out of it? Did the Lady in Shadow encourage her child to leave, or did the adventurer escape from the maze of thorns where they were held prisoner (for their own good, of course)? Does the character have a fey lover or rival in Thelanis? With the DM's permission, such a changeling—of any race—could replace their background feature with the Fey Nature feature provided in the sidebar.": "作为一个孩子，任何角色都可能在显灵区徘徊，偶然进入一个精灵火种，甚至引起大法官的注意，被带到Thelanis去。吟游诗人可以在皮拉斯-皮亚尔学到他们的技艺。德鲁伊的能力可能与自然界的联系较少，而更多地与精灵的魔法有关。也许术士没有守护者，但他们是影中女士的养子，通过观察她学会了她的技巧。如果是这样的话，这个角色是否欢迎有朝一日回到Thelanis，或者他们被赶出了Thelanis？影中人鼓励她的孩子离开，还是冒险者从他们被囚禁的荆棘迷宫中逃脱（当然是为了他们自己的利益）？该角色在Thelanis有一个精灵的情人或对手吗？在DM的允许下，这样的改变--任何种族--都可以用侧边栏中提供的 \"费伊性质 \"特征来取代他们的背景特征。",
	"Due to the time you've spent in Thelanis, you feel more comfortable with the fey than your own kind, and can often find a welcome with them. This provides no protection from hostile fey, but fey that aren't aggressive are more likely to talk with you, and might provide you with safe passage through their territory or even share stories. Lesser fey are also hidden across the world—minor spirits that dwell in cupboards and clearings—and these spirits might emerge to offer you minor aid or advice. Just don't forget that you're always expected to offer payment for services you receive, even if it's just a gift of food or a song.": "由于你在Thelanis度过的时间，你觉得与费伊人相处比与你的同类相处更舒服，而且常常能在他们那里找到欢迎的感觉。这并不能保护你免受敌对的费伊人的伤害，但不具攻击性的费伊人更有可能与你交谈，并可能为你提供通过其领地的安全通道或甚至分享故事。较小的费伊也隐藏在世界各地--居住在橱柜和空地上的小精灵--这些精灵可能会出现，为你提供小的援助或建议。只是别忘了，你总是要为你得到的服务提供报酬，即使只是一份食物或一首歌的礼物。",
	"The touch of Xoriat will warp your flesh and corrupt your mind. The inhabitants of this alien realm seek to transform or destroy all that is natural, and even the slightest contact with it is dangerous.": "Xoriat的触摸将扭曲你的肉体，腐蚀你的思想。这个异域的居民试图改造或摧毁所有自然的东西，即使与它有最轻微的接触也是危险的。",
	"At least, that's the popular opinion—but it's not entirely true. The plane's title, \"Realm of Madness,\" is a label applied by the people of Eberron based on the perception that close interaction with Xoriat can interfere with your ability to process reality. But illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations... and this may be more accurate. Where Lamannia embodies the natural world, Xoriat instead embodies the unnatural. It's a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don't see, ones they're ill-equipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace—all of these are inventions. They're the foundations mortal lives are built on... but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.": "至少，这是流行的观点，但这并不完全正确。这个平面的标题，\"疯狂之境\"，是Eberron的人们根据与Xoriat的密切互动会干扰你处理现实的能力而贴的标签。但是伊利特人称Xoriat为 \"启示之境\"......而这可能更准确。拉曼尼亚体现了自然世界，而Xoriat则体现了非自然的世界。这是一扇了解现实运作的窗口，凡人通常看不到，他们没有能力处理这些问题。它表明，时间和空间、秩序和混乱、战争与和平，所有这些都是发明。它们是凡人生活的基础......但在这些基础之下是什么？在房子建成之前有什么，之后又会有什么？Xoriat拥有这些问题的答案，以及无限多的答案。",
	"Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat. Mortals dream in Dal Quor. Shavarath sparks mortal anger. Mabar feeds mortal shadows, while Irian holds their spark of light. When mortals die, their souls are drawn to Dolurrh. Mortals are influenced by all of the planes, and the influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat's also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn't evil or destructive. It's part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, Lamannia is the blueprint for nature, Daanvi provides guiding order. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been—and of the unseen ways it {@i is}.": "尽管这一事实经常被忽视，但所有凡人都与Xoriat有联系。凡人在达尔库尔做梦。沙瓦拉特激发了凡人的愤怒。马巴尔为凡人的阴影提供食物，而伊里安则持有他们的光之火花。当凡人死亡时，他们的灵魂会被吸引到多鲁尔。凡人受到所有平面的影响，而Xoriat的影响促使人们渴望质疑现实。它可以成为灵感的源泉，特别是对艺术家而言；它帮助人们挑战他们的假设，以一种全新的方式看待事物。但Xoriat也是融化任何过于接近的人的翅膀的太阳。从远处看，它的影响可以是一种积极的力量，但是凡人如果过于深入地凝视Xoriat，就会与他们的本土现实失去联系，失去驾驭自然世界的能力。所以Xoriat是一个非常危险的地方，但这个平面本身并不邪恶或破坏性。它是宇宙平衡的一部分，与其他星球的任何概念一样重要。伊里安带来了生命，拉曼尼亚是大自然的蓝图，达安维提供了指导性的秩序。Xoriat是对背后和超越的一瞥，是对现实可能存在的其他方式的一瞥，也是对它看不见的方式的一瞥（%0%）。",
	"To mortal eyes, Xoriat may seem more chaotic than Kythri. However, it's not defined by the idea of chaos; rather, mortals don't understand the logic that guides its changes. Additionally, Kythri's constant change is still always natural: fire and lightning, stone and water. On the other hand, in Xoriat, a tornado might be composed of ink. Each grain in a sandstorm could be a miniature bust of Queen Aurala of Aundair, or a tiny beating heart. It's not simply chaotic; it's unnatural.": "在凡人眼中，Xoriat似乎比Kythri更混乱。然而，它并不是由混乱的概念定义的；相反，凡人并不理解指导其变化的逻辑。此外，Kythri的不断变化仍然总是自然的：火和闪电，石头和水。另一方面，在Xoriat，龙卷风可能是由墨水组成。沙暴中的每一粒都可能是昂代尔女王奥拉拉的微型半身像，或者是一颗小小的跳动的心脏。这不是简单的混乱；它是不自然的。",
	"Immediately after a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.": "在生物施展一级或以上的法术后，立即在《{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}》第三章的野性魔法涌动表上滚动。",
	"Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it's afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). If it later fails this saving throw an additional time, its previous madness effect is replaced with a new one.": "每当一个生物完成短期或长期休息，或被降低到0命中率时，它必须做一个DC14的魅力储蓄动作。如果救赎失败，它就会受到一种随机的短期疯狂的影响（见《（%0%）》第8章）。如果它后来又一次失败，它之前的疯狂效果就会被一个新的效果取代。",
	"More than any other plane, time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It's even possible for them to return to Eberron {@i before} they left, potentially becoming stranded in another time, as discussed in the next section.": "在Xoriat，时间比任何其他位面都要不可靠。冒险家们可能会被困于疯狂之境，感觉像是一辈子，然后发现在Eberron只过了一瞬间。他们甚至有可能回到他们离开的Eberron（%0%），有可能成为另一个时代的滞留者，这在下一节中讨论。",
	"The things adventurers rely on—gravity, time, their identity itself—aren't always reliable in Xoriat. When characters enter a new layer, the DM can choose a property from the {@table Properties of Xoriat|ExploringEberron} table. This property could apply the entire time the adventurers are on that layer, or it could change when combat begins, whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, or at any other time the DM chooses. There are no saving throws against these effects, and an effect impacts all creatures in the layer until the DM replaces that property with a new one. In describing a property, don't just describe the effect, but explain how it manifests. {@spell Haste} and {@spell slow} reflect a shift in the local flow of time. When creatures can {@spell detect thoughts}, they can hear the thoughts of others flowing like music all around them, and if they concentrate on a single creature, they can translate the meaning of the melody. Each effect reflects a strange new property of reality in this layer.": "冒险者所依赖的东西--重力、时间、他们的身份本身--在Xoriat并不总是可靠。当角色进入一个新层时，DM可以从{@table Properties of Xoriat|ExploringEberron}表中选择一个属性。这个属性可以在冒险者在该层的整个过程中适用，也可以在战斗开始时、生物在D20上掷出1时或在DM选择的任何其他时间改变。对这些效果没有救赎，一个效果会影响该层的所有生物，直到DM用一个新的属性取代该属性。在描述一个属性时，不要只描述效果，还要解释它是如何表现的。{@spell Haste}和{@spell slow}反映了当地时间流的转变。当生物可以（%3%）时，他们可以听到其他人的思想像音乐一样在他们周围流动，如果他们集中在一个生物身上，他们可以翻译出旋律的含义。每种效果都反映了这一层中现实的一种奇怪的新属性。",
	"There's a logic to the structure of the planes. Irian is the beginning, where new seeds are born. Mabar is the end, consuming all things. Time sometimes moves at different rates in different planes, but it always moves forward... except in Xoriat.": "各个星球的结构有一个逻辑。伊里安是开始，新的种子在那里诞生。马巴尔是终点，吞噬所有的东西。在不同的星球，时间有时以不同的速度移动，但它总是向前移动......除了在Xoriat。",
	"Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn't tell you what will happen, because that hasn't been decided yet. It's a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at \"Queen Aurala is assassinated\" and then turn right at \"Breland becomes a democracy,\" you'll reach \"Sul Khatesh is released from her prison.\" The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire—a map to the many possibilities of the future.": "把时间想象成一个迷宫，把物质界想象成一只老鼠在其中移动，把其他星球穿成一个皇冠。这就是《德拉贡预言》的运作方式。它不会告诉你会发生什么，因为那还没有决定。它是通往迷宫的路线图，揭示了如果你在 \"奥拉拉女王被暗杀 \"处左转，然后在 \"布雷兰德成为一个民主国家 \"处右转，你就会到达 \"苏尔-卡蒂什从监狱中被释放\"。预言显示了你为实现你所期望的结果而需要走的道路--一张通往未来的多种可能性的地图。",
	"But Xoriat isn't bound to the rat. It hovers above the maze. And adventurers could return to the wrong time when they leave it, falling farther back in the maze. They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. Perhaps they help Halas Tarkanan win the War of the Mark; the dragonmarked houses are broken and scattered before they ever achieve their current glory, and people with aberrant dragonmarks thrive. With these changes, modern Khorvaire would be a very different place. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat's crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there—forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it's possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change—but it's always possible to restore a forgotten past.": "但Xoriat并没有被束缚在老鼠身上。它盘旋在迷宫之上。而冒险者在离开它时可能会回到错误的时间，在迷宫中跌得更远。他们可能会发现自己在达卡安帝国，或者在马克战争的中间。而在这个过程中，他们可能会改变未来。也许他们会帮助哈拉斯-塔卡南赢得印记之战；有龙纹的家族在获得目前的荣耀之前就被打破并分散了，而拥有反常龙纹的人则茁壮成长。有了这些变化，现代霍尔韦尔将是一个非常不同的地方。在这样做的过程中，冒险者们在迷宫中投下了一只新的老鼠。这只新老鼠变成了主物质界。它抢走了老老鼠的星球之冠，成为所有星球汇聚的现实，也是时间前进的地方。但是另一只老鼠仍然在那里--被遗忘和迷失，蜷缩在一个角落里，但仍然活着。而且，如果冒险家们回到Xoriat，他们有可能改变主意；他们可以找到回到最初的老鼠的方法，让它回到其作为主物质位面的角色。因此，Xoriat给了戏剧性变化的可能性--但总是有可能恢复被遗忘的过去。",
	"This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It's possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world, as described in the section on Kythri. The gith lived on a world that was once the Prime Material Plane. Now it may just be another rat lost and forgotten in the maze. Should the daelkyr rise and complete their work, it's possible the current Eberron could be torn away from the planes; it would still exist, but as a forgotten shadow of the new central reality that takes its place.": "这个观点对于理解daelkyr至关重要。他们站在迷宫之上，但他们也能下到迷宫中。他们在老鼠身上做实验，改变它。如果他们做了太多的改变会怎样？老鼠有可能爬到一个角落里死去，然后一只新的老鼠被释放出来：也许旧的擎天柱消失了，一个新的世界正在前进。这就是吉斯人认为他们的世界所发生的事情，在关于Kythri的章节中有所描述。吉斯人生活在一个曾经是主物质界的世界上。现在它可能只是迷失在迷宫中被遗忘的另一只老鼠。如果daelkyr崛起并完成了他们的工作，当前的Eberron有可能被从诸位面中剥离出来；它仍然存在，但作为新的中心现实的一个被遗忘的影子而被取代。",
	"If this doesn't entirely make sense, that's appropriate. Most scholars in Khorvaire would call this theory madness, and so Xoriat receives its name. But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. Irian is the beginning, Mabar is the end—and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn't bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn't entirely build reality, but rather, they {@i sculpted} it—chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.": "如果这并不完全合理，那也是合适的。Khorvaire的大多数学者会称这种理论为疯狂，因此Xoriat得到了它的名字。但其他人可能会说，这与祖先的神话是一致的。伊里安是起点，马巴尔是终点--而Xoriat可能是站在旅程之上的一个点，是祖先们可以研究他们工作的高处。Xoriat不受约束其他星球的法律的约束，而且它拥有所有被抛弃的想法。也许主宰者们并没有完全建立起现实，而是他们（百分之十）--把东西拿走，丢到了Xoriat。",
	"This is a metaphysical discussion that most adventurers will never need to worry about. There are three things to take away from it. Xoriat is a point from which history and reality itself can be changed. The daelkyr have changed it an unknown number of times. And from Xoriat, it's possible for adventurers to either change it themselves—or to undo damage they might have done.": "这是一个形而上的讨论，大多数冒险者永远不需要担心。有三件事可以从中得到启发。Xoriat是一个点，历史和现实本身可以被改变。daelkyr已经改变了它不知道多少次。而从Xoriat，冒险者有可能自己改变它--或者撤销他们可能已经造成的损害。",
	"In Xoriat, there are masses of swirling colors, hues never seen on Eberron. There are ripples in space that disrupt time in their wake. There are bursts of powerful emotion that drift across layers. These may well be alive in some way—but there's no way to communicate with them. This section discusses some of the creatures most relevant to adventurers. While the plane might hold other forces that could be considered alive, their thought processes would almost certainly be fundamentally inhuman, and they wouldn't recognize organic beings as life.": "在Xoriat，有大量旋转的颜色，在Eberron从未见过的色调。空间中的涟漪扰乱了时间。有强大的情感迸发，飘过各层。这些东西很可能在某种程度上是有生命的，但是没有办法与它们交流。本节讨论了一些与冒险者最相关的生物。虽然飞机上可能有其他可以被认为是有生命的力量，但它们的思维过程几乎肯定是根本没有人性的，而且它们不会承认有机生物是生命。",
	"The daelkyr came to Eberron to corrupt it and transform its people, and they crippled the Dhakaani Empire before being bound in Khyber. Six are known by name, but there are surely others. They remain trapped in Khyber to this day, waiting for the chance to rise and finish the work they began... and perhaps to pave the way for a new reality.": "daelkyr来到Eberron，腐蚀它并改造它的人民，在被束缚在Khyber之前，他们使Dhakaani帝国陷入瘫痪。有六个人的名字为人所知，但肯定还有其他人。他们至今仍被困在开伯尔，等待机会崛起并完成他们开始的工作......或许还能为新的现实铺平道路。",
	"There are no known accounts of mortals traveling to Xoriat—at least, none who returned—so adventurers who do so are likely undertaking a historic journey. And in that journey, they may make a shocking discovery—though the daelkyr may be bound in Khyber, they are also {@i still in Xoriat}. Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra—each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat's uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven't left yet, or they might've already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down—but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can't return to Eberron now, because they're already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they're also watching it all unfold from above. So adventurers could interact with any of the daelkyr in Xoriat, but fighting them there won't impact their actions on Eberron. However, it could help adventurers learn about the weaknesses of the daelkyr, or perhaps obtain tools or weapons to use against them in the future.": "没有任何关于凡人前往Xoriat的记载--至少，没有人回来--因此，这样做的冒险者很可能是在进行一次历史性的旅行。在这次旅行中，他们可能会有一个惊人的发现--虽然达尔基尔可能被束缚在开伯尔，但他们也是（%0%）。腐败者Dyrrn、Valaara、Belashyrra--每个人都住在Xoriat的一个领地里，有他们的仆人和军队陪伴。这与Xoriat与时间的不可思议关系有关。daelkyr可能在Xoriat，因为他们还没有离开，或者他们可能已经从监狱中被释放并回到了Xoriat。同样，如果时间是一个迷宫，daelkyr站在上面向下看，但同时，他们也在迷宫中奔跑。他们现在不能回到Eberron，因为他们已经在那里了；但这可能就是为什么他们看起来对长期监禁不以为然的原因，因为他们也在上面看着这一切的展开。因此，冒险者可以与Xoriat的任何一个daelkyr互动，但在那里与他们战斗并不会影响他们在Eberron的行动。然而，这可以帮助冒险者了解daelkyr的弱点，或者也许可以获得工具或武器，在未来用来对付他们。",
	"The natural inhabitants of the plane are often so alien that mortals don't even recognize them as living things. Most of the aberrations that people are familiar with on Eberron aren't creations of Xoriat itself. Rather, the daelkyr, powers designed to interact with the Material Plane and its with mortals, created these aberrations as their servants, soldiers, and mementos of past conquests. In Eberron, most daelkyr have mixed forces; mind flayers could be found serving any of the great lords. In Xoriat, they're more segregated; beholders dwell in the domain of Belashyrra, and mind flayers in the realm of Dyrrn.": "这个星球上的自然居民往往是如此的陌生，以至于凡人甚至都不认识他们是活物。人们在Eberron熟悉的大多数畸形生物都不是Xoriat自己创造的。相反，daelkyr，这些旨在与物质世界和凡人互动的力量，创造了这些异形作为他们的仆人、士兵和过去征服的纪念品。在Eberron，大多数daelkyr都有混合的力量；可以发现思想传播者为任何一个大领主服务。在Xoriat，他们更多的是被隔离开来；Beholders住在Belashyrra的领地，而mind flayers住在Dyrrn的领域。",
	"What other terrors do the daelkyr have in Xoriat that they've never unleashed in Eberron? This depends in part on how many other realities the daelkyr have transformed; the mind flayers are relics of the destruction of the gith, just as the dolgrims and dolgaunts are souvenirs of the downfall of Dhakaan.": "daelkyr在Xoriat还有什么可怕的东西是他们在Eberron从未释放过的？这在一定程度上取决于达尔凯尔人改造了多少其他的现实世界；噬心者是吉斯人毁灭后的遗物，就像多尔格林斯和多尔冈特是达卡安衰落后的纪念品。",
	"While aberrations created by the daelkyr are usually dangerous, there are also aberrations generated by the layers themselves. These planar creatures are alien and disturbing, but aren't threatening unless provoked. The {@table Native Aberrations|ExploringEberron} table presents a few examples.": "虽然由daelkyr创造的畸变通常是危险的，但也有一些畸变是由层本身产生的。这些平面生物是外来的、令人不安的，但除非受到挑衅，否则并不具有威胁性。{@table Native Aberrations|ExploringEberron}表格中介绍了几个例子。",
	"The daelkyr aren't the most powerful forces in Xoriat. There are greater powers in the void, spirits so vast and alien that they can only be perceived by the ripples they create in reality. Both the Unseen Citadel and Belashyrra are ideas in the mind of something greater. Do these powers slumber? Do they consciously adjust the rules of their layers? Or are they simply ideas cast aside by the Progenitors, models of reality that were ultimately abandoned? If Xoriat is the realm of discarded concepts, this could be the drive behind the daelkyr's endless quest to disfigure—or perfect—reality.": "daelkyr并不是Xoriat中最强大的力量。虚空中还有更强大的力量，精神是如此巨大和陌生，以至于只能通过它们在现实中产生的涟漪来感知。看不见的城堡和贝拉希拉都是更大的东西在头脑中的想法。这些力量会沉睡吗？它们会有意识地调整其层级的规则吗？或者它们只是被始祖抛弃的想法，是最终被抛弃的现实模型？如果Xoriat是被抛弃的概念的领域，这可能是daelkyr无休止地追求破坏或完善现实的动力。",
	"Xoriat is a void lacking not only matter, but also space and time, and a mortal creature that enters it effectively ceases to exist. But there are powers in this void, and the layers of Xoriat reflect their thoughts. Each of the daelkyr dwells in a layer, the place that spawned that daelkyr; this layer usually reflects the daelkyr in tone, and it can use its lair actions anywhere in its layer. However, not all of Xoriat's layers can support mortal life; there's a layer where intense gravity crushes any physical creature, and a layer where all matter is transformed into pure thought.": "Xoriat是一个虚空，不仅缺乏物质，而且缺乏空间和时间，进入它的凡人生物实际上就不存在了。但在这个虚空中存在着力量，Xoriat的各层反映了他们的想法。每个daelkyr都住在一个层里，也就是催生该daelkyr的地方；这个层通常反映了daelkyr的语气，它可以在其层的任何地方使用其巢穴行动。然而，并不是所有的Xoriat层都能支持凡人的生命；有一个层的强烈重力会粉碎任何物理生物，还有一个层的所有物质都被转化为纯粹的思想。",
	"Adventurers need to find portals to move from layer to layer. Portals are unique based on the layer's properties of each layer, and using a portal always has a price. Sometimes the price is paid in memories; the DM sets the emotional tone of the memory ( joy, sorrow, anger), then each player describes the memory their character has lost. With other portals, the price may be knowledge, but this isn't taken from the adventurers—rather, when they pass through the portal, they learn a secret they might have rather not known.": "冒险家们需要找到传送门来在各层之间移动。根据每一层的属性，传送门是独一无二的，而使用传送门总是有代价的。有时，代价是在记忆中付出的；DM设定记忆的情绪基调（快乐、悲伤、愤怒），然后每个玩家描述他们的角色所失去的记忆。对于其他的传送门，代价可能是知识，但这不是从冒险者身上夺走的--而是当他们通过传送门时，他们学到了一个他们可能宁愿不知道的秘密。",
	"In exploring the layers of Xoriat, it's important to highlight the fundamentally unnatural flavor of the plane. In addition to the {@table Properties of Xoriat|ExploringEberron} table provided earlier with shifting effects that have an impact on gameplay, the {@table Alien Attributes of Xoriat|ExploringEberron} table presents examples of cosmetic details that can be distinctive features of a layer. Beyond that, the layers of Xoriat contain revelations; these can be truths about the adventurers that they don't want to know, or secrets about reality itself. This is discussed in more detail in the section on Xorian Artifacts.": "在探索Xoriat的各层时，重要的是要强调该平面根本上不自然的味道。除了前面提供的{@table Properties of Xoriat|ExploringEberron}表格中的对游戏有影响的移位效果外，{@table Alien Attributes of Xoriat|ExploringEberron}表格中还提供了一些外观细节的例子，这些细节可以成为一个层的独特特征。除此之外，Xoriat的各层还包含启示；这些启示可以是冒险者不想知道的真相，也可以是关于现实本身的秘密。这将在 \"Xorian Artifacts \"一节中详细讨论。",
	"This is the stronghold and birthplace of the daelkyr Belashyrra. The Lord of Eyes imagined the beholders and brought that vision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin. Tiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like creatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. The true beholders are mostly focused in deep contemplation of specific things, and don't pay attention to outsiders unless they're disturbed. Some study strange paintings. Others watch scrying pools reflecting images of Eberron or other planes. And some examine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key, a dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few that patrol the Citadel, watchful for intruders.The surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent material that your eyes can't quite focus on, as if the walls and floor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls. Some run slow and show you younger than they are; others show glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you don't want to know—current events on Eberron, scenes from the past, or the possible future.": "这里是daelkyr Belashyrra的堡垒和诞生地。眼神之主想象出了看守者，并将这一愿景变为现实，而这个城堡则是众多看守者的家。微小的浮动眼睛像昆虫一样嗡嗡作响。千足虫一样的生物有一排眼睛在他们的背上流动。真正的观世者大多专注于对特定事物的深思熟虑，除非受到干扰，否则不会注意到外人。有些人研究奇怪的画。另一些人则观察反射着艾伯伦或其他位面的图像的探知池。还有一些研究看似平凡的物品，比如一把生锈的铁钥匙、一只死兔子或一顶昂贵的帽子。然而，也有少数人在城堡里巡逻，警惕着入侵者。城堡的表面是由一种彩虹色的材料制成的，你的眼睛无法完全聚焦，就像墙壁和地板是模糊的。大厅里到处都有镜子。有些镜子运行缓慢，显示你比他们年轻；有些镜子显示未来的一瞥。窥探池揭示了你不想知道的秘密--Eberron的当前事件，过去的场景，或者可能的未来。",

Varr farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate are emotions; anyone walking through a field feels a powerful emotion (fear, sorrow, anger, guilt) washing over them. Each field has an outpost containing an elder brain, with a bright line of thought transmitting the emotions to Dyrrn's tower at the heart of the layer.": "这一层是腐蚀者迪尔恩的领域。紫色的田野沐浴在紫外光中，荧光雕塑散发出阴森的暗光。瓦尔农民在打理田地时跳舞，但他们培养的是情感；任何走过田地的人都会感到一种强大的情感（恐惧、悲伤、愤怒、内疚）冲刷着他们。每块田地都有一个包含长者大脑的前哨，有一条明亮的思想线将情绪传送到位于该层中心的迪尔恩的塔。",

Mirrors reflect images of things the viewer hates, and books in the house chronicle the hateful deeds committed by everyone the adventurers know—including each other. The longer the adventurers stay in the houses, the easier it becomes to hate each other... or themselves.": "每个角色看到房子的形式略有不同，但他们都{@i feel}看到墙上的仇恨。镜子反射出观众讨厌的东西的图像，房子里的书记录了冒险家们认识的每个人--包括彼此--所犯下的可憎行为。冒险家们在房子里呆的时间越长，就越容易憎恨对方......或自己。",
	"There's seemingly no end to this endless void of bleak solitude. To proceed, the characters must act out their travel—pretending to travel just as they pretend there is meaning in their lives. If they can keep up the charade, the world they imagine will take shape around them.": "这无尽的空虚凄凉的孤独似乎没有尽头。为了继续下去，人物必须表演他们的旅行--假装旅行，就像他们假装自己的生活有意义一样。如果他们能保持这种伪装，他们所想象的世界就会在他们周围形成。",
	"The trees grow secrets, while more buzz around in the air like tiny birds. Some of them may be secrets of the adventurers, or those of their enemies. Others are secrets of strangers and secrets about reality. Do the adventurers block their ears, or do they try to listen?": "树上长着秘密，而更多的秘密像小鸟一样在空中嗡嗡作响。其中一些可能是冒险家的秘密，或者是他们的敌人的秘密。还有一些是陌生人的秘密和关于现实的秘密。冒险家们是堵住自己的耳朵，还是试着去听？",
	"The seals of the Gatekeepers block travel to Xoriat, but there are still many ways the Realm of Madness can affect the world.": "守门人的封印阻挡了通往Xoriat的旅行，但疯狂领域仍有许多方式可以影响世界。",
	"Manifest zones tied to Xoriat are common in the Shadow Marches, but rare elsewhere. The effects of a Xorian manifest zone are rarely as dramatic as the alien attributes of the plane itself. However, manifest zones may convey one or more of the universal properties of the plane. The most common is the Dangerous Revelations property. People who linger in a Xorian zone often find alien concepts creeping into their brains, instilling strange beliefs, or twisting their sense of reality. These zones can easily produce cults of the Dragon Below; in the Shadow Marches, the Gatekeepers struggle to keep people out of these zones, while Marcher cultists consider them to be sacred sites.": "与Xoriat有关的显化区在阴影地带很常见，但在其他地方却很罕见。Xorian显化区的效果很少像飞机本身的异形属性那样引人注目。然而，显化区可以传达一个或多个位面的普遍属性。最常见的是危险的启示属性。徘徊在Xorian区域的人经常发现外星概念悄悄进入他们的大脑，灌输奇怪的信仰，或扭曲他们对现实的感觉。这些区域很容易产生对下方之龙的崇拜；在阴影地带，守门人努力不让人们进入这些区域，而行军者的崇拜者则认为它们是神圣的场所。",
	"Unpredictable Magic is another common property; such zones often have unnatural flora or fauna, but these effects are unreliable and change with each generation. The properties of Time Is an Illusion and Strange Reality are rare in manifest zones, and may not be active all the time; these effects might only become active when Lharvion is full, or when disturbing rituals are performed.": "不可预测的魔法是另一个常见的属性；这种区域通常有非自然的植物或动物，但这些效果是不可靠的，并随着每一代人的变化而变化。时间是一种幻觉 \"和 \"奇怪的现实 \"的属性在显化区是很罕见的，而且可能不会一直活跃；这些效果可能只有在拉维恩满了，或者在进行令人不安的仪式时才会活跃。",
	"The last time Xoriat was coterminous, the daelkyr brought their armies through the walls of reality and laid waste to the Empire of Dhakaan. The seals crafted long ago by the Gatekeeper druids keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber, but they also keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous. Xoriat's remote phases have no known effect, and like Kythri, they're unpredictable, though the phases tend to come and go far more slowly than Kythri's do. There are no recorded instances of citizens of the Five Nations visiting Xoriat; most scholars believe that the Gatekeeper seals prevent all planar travel... though someone may have secretly built an eldritch machine in a manifest zone, perhaps incorporating illithid brains or the position of the moon Lharvion. What would happen if the adventurers stumbled on a cult of the Dragon Below just as the cult completes its sinister rituals?": "上一次Xoriat是同城化，daelkyr带着他们的军队穿过现实之墙，将达卡安帝国夷为平地。守门人德鲁伊很久以前制作的封印使戴尔基尔被束缚在开伯尔，但它们也使Xoriat不会成为同体。Xoriat的远程阶段没有已知的影响，和Kythri一样，它们是不可预测的，尽管这些阶段往往比Kythri的来去缓慢得多。没有五国公民访问Xoriat的记录；大多数学者认为，守门人的封印阻止了所有的星球旅行......尽管有人可能在一个显露区秘密建造了一台长生机，也许结合了illithid的大脑或月亮Lharvion的位置。如果冒险家们偶然发现了下面的龙的邪教，就在该邪教完成其邪恶的仪式时，会发生什么？",
	"The most common artifacts of Xoriat are the symbiont items created by the daelkyr. Examples of these living items can be found in chapter 7 of this book, as well as in chapter 5 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. However, adventurers could stumble on artifacts brought to Eberron by the daelkyr in their great incursion—or relics even more ancient. One effect of Xorian items could be to twist time. On a minor level, this could explain the powers of a cloak of displacement; it always shows you a few seconds ahead of your current position. A more powerful artifact could allow travel through time, or reset time in a small region. Does the time tunnel allow a return trip, or are those who use it trapped on the other side?": "Xoriat最常见的神器是由daelkyr创造的共生体物品。这些活体物品的例子可以在本书第七章以及（%0%）第五章中找到。然而，冒险者们可能会偶然发现daelkyr在他们的大入侵中带到Eberron的文物，或者更古老的遗物。Xorian物品的一个效果可能是扭曲时间。在一个小的层面上，这可以解释位移斗篷的力量；它总是显示你比你现在的位置提前几秒。一个更强大的神器可以允许穿越时间，或者在一个小区域内重置时间。时间隧道是否允许回程，或者那些使用它的人被困在另一边？",
	"Xoriat is also known for granting maddening knowledge and physical transformation. Either of these effects could be reflected by supernatural gifts, as presented in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Here are a few examples:": "Xoriat也以授予令人疯狂的知识和身体改造而闻名。这些效果中的任何一种都可以通过超自然的礼物来体现，如（%0%）的第七章所介绍的。这里有几个例子。",
	"The character's blood is replaced with a sentient protoplasm that whispers to them while they sleep. It grants the benefits of a blessing of wound closure.": "角色的血液被一种有生命的原生质体所取代，在他们睡觉时对他们耳语。它赋予伤口封闭的祝福的好处。",
	"The character gains the blessing of understanding, but they also learn that any time they cast a spell, something dies. When they cast a cantrip, it might be a rodent or a bird. The more powerful the spell, the more significant the death. The caster will likely never see this effect occur, but they know that someone somewhere is paying the price for their magic... and worse, this might be true of all spellcasters.": "该角色获得了理解力的祝福，但他们也了解到，任何时候他们施法，都会有东西死亡。当他们施展咒语时，可能是一只啮齿动物或一只鸟。咒语越强大，死亡就越明显。施法者可能永远不会看到这种效果的发生，但他们知道在某个地方有人正在为他们的魔法付出代价......更糟糕的是，这可能是所有施法者的真实情况。",
	"The character gains the blessing of Valhalla. The spirit warriors it summons are friends of the caster, plucked from the future; the character may not have met all of them yet, but they're people who the character knows or will know. They're returned to the future in an hour or when they drop to 0 hit points... in which case they may die upon being returned to their own time.": "该角色获得瓦尔哈拉的祝福。它所召唤的精神战士是施法者的朋友，从未来拔出来的；角色可能还没有见到他们所有人，但他们都是角色认识或将要认识的人。他们会在一小时后回到未来，或者当他们的生命值下降到0时......在这种情况下，他们可能会在回到自己的时间时死亡。",
	"The seals of the Gatekeepers make Xoriat one of the more difficult planes for adventurers to reach. However, a trip to Xoriat would be a revelatory adventure. Interactions with the denizens of Xoriat are largely limited to the cults of the Dragon Below and the servants of the daelkyr. However, there are a few ways the plane could spawn adventures.": "守门人的封印使Xoriat成为冒险者较难到达的星球之一。然而，到Xoriat的旅行将是一次启示性的冒险。与Xoriat居民的互动主要限于下面的龙的崇拜者和daelkyr的仆人。然而，有几种方法可以使飞机产生冒险。",
	"A warlock with a Great Old One patron could say that their patron isn't simply a daelkyr; rather, it's one of the Powers of the Void within Xoriat itself. Such contact is unprecedented—what is the nature of this connection? It may be that the Power doesn't converse with the warlock, but rather downloads knowledge directly into its mind. A disturbing possibility is that the warlock isn't supposed to be receiving this information; the knowledge stream could be intended for a powerful mind flayer, but the warlock has become linked to this psychic channel. This could provide information about the plans of the illithid's cult, but can the warlock do anything about it?": "一个拥有伟大的老一辈守护者的术士可以说，他们的守护者不仅仅是一个daelkyr，而是Xoriat本身的虚空力量之一。这样的接触是前所未有的，这种联系的本质是什么？可能是这股力量并不与术士交流，而是直接将知识下载到它的脑海中。一个令人不安的可能性是，术士并不应该接受这些信息；知识流可能是为强大的心灵猎手准备的，但术士已经与这个心灵通道联系起来。这可能提供了关于伊利希德的邪教计划的信息，但术士能对此做什么吗？",
	"When the adventurers interfere with a ritual of a cult of the Dragon Below, they find themselves three years in the future... and something has gone terribly wrong. Perhaps the Mourning has spread and consumed Breland. Maybe the overlord Sul Khatesh has broken her bonds; under her rule, the warlock-knights of Aundair are conquering the Five Nations. The adventurers must find a way back to their own time—after they learn how to keep this future from coming to pass.": "当冒险家们干扰了一个龙下教的仪式时，他们发现自己在未来的三年里......而且出了很大的问题。也许哀伤已经蔓延并吞噬了布雷兰德。也许霸主Sul Khatesh已经打破了她的束缚；在她的统治下，Aundair的术士骑士正在征服五国。冒险家们必须找到一条回到他们自己的时间的路，在他们学会如何阻止这种未来的发生之后。",
	"While the adventurers are in a Xorian manifest zone fighting a cult of the Dragon Below, one of the characters receives a revelation: {@i Merrix d'Cannith will destroy the world in two years.} Does it provide any additional information or just this one absolute fact? The character knowsthat this is the truth... but is this an actual glimpse of the future, or is it luring the character down a dark path?": "当冒险者们在一个Xorian的显露区与一个龙下的邪教组织战斗时，其中一个角色得到了一个启示：（%0%）它是否提供了任何额外的信息，或者只是这个绝对的事实？这个人物知道这是事实......但这是对未来的真实瞥见，还是在引诱这个人物走上一条黑暗的道路？",
	"The dwarf muttered to himself as he scaled the imposing cliff. \"‘It's the plane of nature, Rusty!' ‘It'll be a vacation, Rusty!' Well, this is the worst vacation I evaaaaaaaa—\"": "矮人一边攀爬着巍峨的悬崖一边喃喃自语。\"'这是大自然的飞机，拉斯蒂！''这将是一个假期，拉斯蒂！' 好吧，这是我有史以来最糟糕的假期--\"",
	"Dela was already drawing her wand even as her companion began to fall. Her fingers tightened around Rev's shoulder plating as she considered her options. Rusty was tied to the warforged, but his full weight on the rope could dislodge Rev and send them all tumbling down. In her mind, she pictured the threads of gravity pulling the dwarf down, then reshaped the pattern with her thoughts, weaving the threads into a malleable platform.": "甚至在她的同伴开始倒下时，德拉已经在拔她的魔杖。当她考虑她的选择时，她的手指紧紧抓住Rev的肩板。拉斯蒂被绑在战神身上，但他在绳子上的全部重量可能会使雷夫移位，使他们都翻滚下去。在她的脑海中，她想象着重力线将侏儒拉下来，然后用她的思想重塑图案，将线织成一个可塑的平台。",
	"\"—aaaaoOOF!\" Impact with the disk knocked the wind out of Rusty, but he wasn't seriously injured. Dela rotated her wand, reeling in the threads of gravity and pulling the platform toward her. He sat up, glancing around. \"Well, this is an improvement. Couldn't you have done this earlier? Saved my shoulders?\"": "\"-aaaaoOOF！\" 与圆盘的撞击把拉斯蒂的风打掉了，但他并没有受重伤。德拉转动她的魔杖，卷起重力线，把平台拉向她。他坐了起来，扫视四周。\"嗯，这是个进步。你就不能早点这样做吗？保住我的肩膀？\"",
	"\"I didn't want to waste the energy,\" Dela said, struggling to maintain her concentration.": "\"我不想浪费精力，\"德拉说，挣扎着保持她的注意力。",

	"Rev finally reached the top of the cliff. Digging his steel fingers into the soil, he pulled himself, Dela, and Gentle onto the plateau. Dela looked around... and then looked up. The plateau was dominated by a single massive tree—an oak taller than any of the towers of Sharn. Dela could see an airship nestled in the branches, like a child's discarded toy. It was the Storm's End. And they needed to reach it.": "牧师终于到达了悬崖的顶端。他把自己的钢指挖进土壤，把自己、德拉和温柔拉到高原上。德拉环顾四周......然后往上看。高原上有一棵巨大的树--一棵比沙恩的任何一座塔都要高的橡木。德拉可以看到一艘飞艇依偎在树枝上，就像一个孩子丢弃的玩具。那是 \"风暴的尽头\"。而他们需要到达那里。",

Some of the world's most eccentric and brilliant innovators are Maverick artificers, pushing the boundaries of science and magic. The ancient traditions of renowned Dhakaani daashor live on in the Forge Adept artificers of today. The College of the Dirge Singer reflects the wisdom and brilliant leadership that Dhakaani duur'kala offer in both war and peace. The kalashtar's psychic powers are honed in the Mind domain cleric. The Circle of the Forged allows a warforged druid to become a beast of steel.

	"Any kra'uul made of an otherwise-mundane object is a common magic item. Kra'uul made of other magic items are the same rarity as the standard version. While the techniques of crafting kra'uul objects are known only to the chot'uul, the DM can introduce other dreambound objects. A cursed sword might follow its bearer even into dreams, while a powerful artifact could be even more glorious when seen in Dal Quor. ": "任何由其他世俗物品制成的克拉乌尔都是普通的魔法物品。由其他魔法物品制成的Kra'uul与标准版本的稀有性相同。虽然制作kra'uul物品的技术只有chot'uul知道，但DM可以介绍其他与梦境有关的物品。一把被诅咒的剑甚至可以跟随它的持有者进入梦境，而一件强大的神器在Dal Quor中看到时可能会更加光彩夺目。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} includes variant races for dragonmarked characters, along with unique dragonmark focus items that can only be used by creatures with a specific dragonmark. This section provides more dragonmark focuses, as well as rules for granting powerful Siberys dragonmarks.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}包括龙纹角色的变异种族，以及只有拥有特定龙纹的生物才能使用的独特龙纹重点项目。本节提供了更多的龙印焦点，以及授予强大的西伯利亚人龙印的规则。",
	"Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it's easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren't overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases—such as the {@i storm spires} of House Lyrandar and the {@i creation forges} of House Cannith—the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.": "龙纹屋的大部分影响是基于一个简单的原则：放大一个现有的魔法效果，比如龙纹的效果，比从无到有创造同样的效果要容易。就其本身而言，龙纹所赋予的力量并不具有压倒性的力量。然而，经过几个世纪的发展，坎尼斯家族和十二家族已经开发出了一些项目，这些项目可以集中并增强龙印的力量，从而产生强大而可靠的效果。在许多情况下--例如莱兰达家族的{@i storm spires}和坎尼斯家族的{@i creation forges}--奥术大会无法为非龙纹生物复制这些强大的焦点物品的效果。其他物品后来也被复制成任何人都可以使用的形式，但需要使用者拥有特定龙纹的物品总是比对任何人产生同样效果的物品更容易制造，而且成本更低，这给了有龙纹的家族一个重要的优势。",
	"This chapter provides several new dragonmark focus items. In addition, you could have a dragonmark focus item that produces the same effect as an existing magic item from the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|ERLW}—except it can't be used or attuned unless you possess a particular dragonmark. House Lyrandar is working on a version of a {@item broom of flying} for dragonmarked heirs, though they haven't perfected it yet. House Ghallanda is developing a {@i portable inn}—a version of the {@item Daern's Instant Fortress||instant fortress}—but it's proven difficult. It's always up to the DM to decide if there's a dragonmark focus item that replicates the effects of any given magic item, and if so, how readily it's available.": "本章提供了几个新的龙纹重点项目。此外，你可以拥有一个龙纹焦点物品，它产生的效果与{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|ERLW}的现有魔法物品相同--只是除非你拥有特定的龙纹，否则无法使用或调整。Lyrandar家族正在为龙纹继承人开发一个{@item broom of flying}的版本，尽管他们还没有完善它。Ghallanda家族正在开发一个{@i portable inn}--一个{@item Daern's Instant Fortress||instant fortress}的版本--但事实证明这很难。这总是由DM来决定是否有一个龙纹重点项目可以复制任何特定魔法项目的效果，如果有的话，它有多容易获得。",
	"The {@table Dragonmark Focus Items|ExploringEberron} table provides examples of focus items, along with the item whose effects they reproduce and the mark required to use or attune to the focus item. A focus item's rarity is generally less than a similar item that anyone can use, reflecting the relative ease of manufacture. However, this doesn't mean they are readily available; dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear {@item Eyes of minute seeing||Medi spectacles}, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold.": "{@table Dragonmark Focus Items|ExploringEberron}表提供了焦点物品的例子，以及它们所重现的物品效果和使用或调整焦点物品所需的标记。焦点物品的稀有性通常低于任何人都可以使用的类似物品，这反映了其制造的相对容易性。然而，这并不意味着它们是现成的；龙纹聚焦物品很少在商店里出售。它们只能用专有的工具来制造，并由坎尼斯家族和十二家族独家生产，供龙纹家族的可靠代理人使用。因此，虽然许多梅达尼的探究者都戴着（1%），但他们是通过为家族服务而获得的，而不是通过用黄金购买。",
	"While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item, and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. With that said, a focus item's design can differ from the usual magic item's form—the {@i serpentine mirror} has a similar effect to a {@item crystal ball}, but it's a flat mirror as opposed to an orb.": "虽然龙纹聚焦物品通常具有与它所复制的物品相同的外观，但它在物品的某处印有所需标记的图像，并且通常带有相关家族的标志。西伯利亚的龙碎片是焦点物品的重要组成部分，大多数都包括某种形式的碎片。也就是说，聚焦物品的设计可以与通常的魔法物品的形式不同--{@i serpentine mirror}具有与{@item crystal ball}类似的效果，但它是一面平面的镜子，而不是一个球体。",
	"The thirteen true dragonmarks are tied to bloodlines. By the rules provided in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, a dragonmark must be selected during character creation. A dragonmark provides a basic set of abilities, gives you access to that subrace's or variant race's Spells of the Mark feature if you are a spellcaster, and allows you to make use of dragonmark focus items associated with your mark.": "十三枚真正的龙纹与血统有关。根据{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中提供的规则，在创建角色时必须选择一个龙纹。龙纹提供了一套基本的能力，如果你是一个施法者，你可以使用该亚种或变种的龙纹法术功能，并允许你使用与你的龙纹相关的龙纹重点项目。",
	"Rarely, a dragonmarked character develops power that surpasses that of other dragonmarked heirs—a fighter with the Mark of Passage could teleport even though they have no other spellcasting ability, and a Ghallanda innkeeper could summon a magnificent mansion. These rarest and most powerful of dragonmarks are known as Siberys dragonmarks. They are larger and have a far more complex pattern than do other dragonmarks. Typically, a Siberys dragonmark evolves from an existing mark, following a dire situation in which the bearer performs a remarkable feat related to the abilities of their developing mark. However, on even rarer occasion, someone spontaneously manifests a massive, powerful dragonmark despite having never possessed a lesser one.": "罕见的是，一个龙印角色会发展出超越其他龙印继承人的力量--拥有通行印记的战士可以传送，即使他们没有其他法术能力，而一个加兰达旅馆的老板可以召唤出一座宏伟的豪宅。这些最稀有和最强大的龙印被称为西伯利亚龙印。它们比其他龙印要大，图案也要复杂得多。通常情况下，西伯利亚龙印是由现有的龙印演化而来，在一个可怕的情况下，持有者会做出与他们发展中的龙印的能力有关的杰出壮举。然而，在更罕见的情况下，有人会自发地表现出一个巨大而强大的龙纹，尽管他从未拥有过一个较小的龙纹。",
	"Regardless of whether they manifest on a dragonmarked heir or an unknown foundling, the dragonmarked houses value heirs with Siberys dragonmarks. A character who displays such a mark is treated with more respect by other members of the house, but the barons and seneschals may also place greater demands on them. So a Siberys dragonmark is a blessing, but it can also be a burden. The manifestation of a Siberys dragonmark—especially one appearing spontaneously on an unmarked character—can be a sign that the bearer has an important role in the Draconic Prophecy, as well as a warning that dragons, fiends, and other powerful forces may try to manipulate or harm the character.": "无论他们是表现在龙纹继承人身上，还是表现在一个不知名的弃儿身上，龙纹家族都很重视带有西伯利亚龙纹的继承人。一个有这种标记的人物会受到家族其他成员的尊重，但男爵和元老们也会对他们提出更高的要求。因此，西伯利亚龙纹是一种祝福，但它也可能是一种负担。西伯利亚龙纹的显现--尤其是自发地出现在一个没有龙纹的人物身上--可以表明持有者在龙族预言中有着重要的作用，同时也是一个警告，龙、恶魔和其他强大的力量可能会试图操纵或伤害这个人物。",
	"The evolution of a dragonmark could be represented by the existing rules for the Spells of the Mark. At the discretion of the DM and player, a dragonmarked character who has the ability to cast a 5th-level Spell of the Mark could be described as possessing a Siberys dragonmark. Similarly, a dragonmark's progression can also be represented by linking class features to your mark; for example, a rogue with the Mark of Shadow could describe their use of Evasion as a cloak of shadows summoned through the dragonmark. Either of these approaches could reflect a growth in the power of the mark, depending on the story you want to tell and the abilities you want your marked character to possess.": "龙纹的演变可以用现有的印记法术规则来表示。在DM和玩家的决定下，一个有龙纹的角色如果有能力施展五级的印记法术，可以被描述为拥有西伯利亚的龙纹。同样，龙印的进展也可以通过将阶级特征与你的印记联系起来来表示；例如，一个拥有阴影印记的流氓可以将他们对闪避的使用描述为通过龙印召唤出来的阴影斗篷。这些方法中的任何一种都可以反映出印记力量的增长，这取决于你想讲述的故事和你希望你的印记人物拥有的能力。",
	"This section presents rules for developing Siberys dragonmarks as supernatural gifts. Chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} explains the rules for these supernatural gifts, which allow characters to receive rewards of blessings instead of treasure. This allows DMs to depict the sudden development of a dragonmark, or the unexpected growth of an existing one, in the middle of a campaign as best suits the story. Using these rules, the manifestation of a Siberys dragonmark can take a player as much by surprise as it would their character, instead of being tied to certain character levels, feats, or spellcasting ability.": "本节介绍了开发西伯利亚龙印作为超自然天赋的规则。{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的第七章解释了这些超自然礼物的规则，它允许角色获得祝福的奖励而不是宝物。这使得DM可以在战役中间以最适合故事的方式描绘龙印的突然发展，或者现有龙印的意外增长。使用这些规则，西伯利亚龙纹的表现可以让玩家感到惊讶，就像他们的角色一样，而不是与特定的角色等级、功绩或法术能力相联系。",
	"For a character that already possesses a true dragonmark (using a dragonmarked subrace or variant race from {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}), the DM can award them the supernatural gift of an evolving Siberys dragonmark. Characters can only develop the Siberys dragonmark associated with their existing mark; if they are a human with the Mark of Passage, they can't develop the Siberys Mark of Making. Previously dragonmarked characters that develop a Siberys dragonmark gain the benefits associated with the corresponding mark:": "对于已经拥有真正龙纹的角色（使用龙纹亚种或来自（%0%）的变异种族），DM可以授予他们进化的西伯利亚龙纹的超自然天赋。角色只能发展与他们现有印记相关的西伯利亚龙印；如果他们是拥有通行印记的人类，他们不能发展西伯利亚制造印记。之前有龙纹的角色在发展出西伯利亚龙纹后会获得与相应龙纹相关的好处。",
	"Previous editions of the game applied different rules to greater dragonmarks (which developed on characters who already possessed a lesser form of that dragonmark) and Siberys dragonmarks (which unexpectedly developed on characters that were previously unmarked). A character's development of these powerful dragonmarks was reflected by a mix of feats and prestige classes which could only be taken at certain levels; as a result, players often felt it necessary to carefully plan out their mark's progression at character creation for fear of missing out on key abilities.": "以前的游戏版本对大龙印（在已经拥有较小形式的龙印的角色上发展）和西伯利亚龙印（在以前没有龙印的角色上意外地发展）适用不同的规则。一个角色对这些强大的龙印的发展是通过混合的功绩和威望等级来体现的，这些功绩和威望等级只能在特定的等级上进行；因此，玩家常常觉得有必要在创建角色时仔细计划他们的龙印的发展，因为他们害怕错过关键的能力。",
	"However, both of these  marks share a central story, the rare evolution of an immensely powerful dragonmark. {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} streamlined the rules for dragonmarks into a single point of entry, a subrace or variant race chosen during character creation. Similarly, this chapter combines the mechanics for greater and Siberys dragonmarks into a single supernatural gift, granting the Spells of the Mark that lesser heirs possess along with greater powers.": "然而，这两种标记都有一个中心故事，即一个极其强大的龙印的罕见进化。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}将龙印的规则简化为一个单一的切入点，即在角色创建过程中选择的一个亚种族或变异种族。同样地，本章将大龙印和西伯利亚龙印的机制合并为一个单一的超自然天赋，授予较小的继承人所拥有的印记法术以及更大的力量。",
	"If it better suits your story, you could choose to take the approach of previous editions; a previously unmarked character could manifest a Siberys mark that only grants a singular high-level spell (without granting the lower-level spells of other marked characters). But by default, the rules in this book give the same abilities to all characters that develop advanced dragonmarks, regardless of whether they were marked previously.": "如果更适合你的故事，你可以选择采取以前版本的方法；一个以前没有标记的角色可以显现出一个西伯利亚人的标记，只授予一个单一的高级法术（不授予其他有标记的角色的低级法术）。但在默认情况下，本书的规则给所有发展出高级龙印的角色以相同的能力，无论他们之前是否被标记过。",
	"On rare occasion, a character that doesn't bear a dragonmark can spontaneously develop a Siberys dragonmark. These characters must be of the same base race as the other bearers of that dragonmark, as established by the subrace or variant race for that dragonmark from {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. So, for example, only a dwarf can manifest a Siberys Mark of Warding. All Siberys-marked characters have blood ties to the dragonmarked house that bears that mark, though they might not have known about the connection until the mark manifests. Dragonmarked houses usually try to recruit these characters, recognizing their immense value as envoys and agents.": "在极少数情况下，一个没有龙纹的角色可以自发地形成西伯利亚龙纹。这些角色必须与该龙纹的其他持有者属于同一基本种族，由该龙纹的子种族或变异种族确定（%0%）。因此，举例来说，只有矮人可以表现出Siberys的守护标记。所有带有西伯利亚标记的角色都与带有该标记的龙纹家族有血缘关系，尽管他们在标记显现之前可能并不知道这种关系。龙纹家族通常会试图招募这些角色，因为他们认识到自己作为使节和代理人的巨大价值。",
	"If a DM chose to tell a different story, they might break this rule and grant a Siberys mark to a character of a different species (such as granting a Mark of Warding to a changeling character). This would be an unprecedented historic event, and the house that bears the mark could consider the character an abomination and a threat.": "如果管理员选择讲述一个不同的故事，他们可能会打破这一规则，将西伯利亚人的标记授予一个不同物种的角色（比如将守护标记授予一个变种人角色）。这将是一个史无前例的历史事件，拥有该标记的家族可以将该角色视为一种憎恶和威胁。",
	"Previously unmarked characters that develop a Siberys dragonmark gain the following benefits:": "以前没有标记的角色，如果形成了西伯利亚的龙纹，会获得以下好处。",
	"The mark grants the same powers as the Siberys dragonmark does on previously marked characters, as described in the previous section.": "该标记授予的权力与西伯利亚龙纹对先前标记的人物所授予的权力相同，如上一节所述。",
	"The character can attune to and use any magic items that require a creature bear that particular dragonmark; for example, a character with a Siberys Mark of Detection can use {@item Eyes of minute seeing||Medi spectacles}, but not {@item dimensional shackles||Kundar chains}.": "该角色可以适应并使用任何需要生物带有该特定龙印的魔法物品；例如，拥有西伯利亚人的探测印记的角色可以使用（%0%），但不能使用（%1%）。",
	"If the character has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Spells of the Mark table for the corresponding dragonmarked subrace or variant race in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} are added to the spell list of their spellcasting class. However, the character doesn't gain any of the other racial features usually associated with their dragonmark's subrace or variant race.": "如果该角色拥有法术或契约魔法类特征，那么相应的龙纹亚族或变异种族的法术表上的法术会以（%0%）的比例加入他们法术类的法术列表。然而，该角色并没有获得任何其他通常与他们的龙纹亚族或变异种族相关的种族特征。",
	"This book uses the rules for supernatural gifts due to their flexibility, letting the DM tell a compelling story of a powerful dragonmark that manifests unexpectedly during a campaign. However, some DMs may wish to make Siberys dragonmarks available for players to select in more traditional ways. For example, some games use the Shared Campaign rules in Appendix A of {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, in which players earn \"treasure points\" they can use to select their own story rewards as the game progresses, rather than receiving DM-selected story rewards such as magic items or supernatural gifts. This sidebar contains suggestions on how to integrate Siberys dragonmarks into a game where the DM does not wish to use supernatural gifts.": "本书使用了超自然天赋的规则，因为其灵活性，让DM讲述一个引人注目的故事，即在战役中意外显现的强大龙印。然而，有些DM可能希望让Siberys的龙印供玩家以更传统的方式来选择。例如，有些游戏使用（%0%）附录A中的共享活动规则，其中玩家获得 \"宝藏点\"，他们可以随着游戏的进行用来选择自己的故事奖励，而不是接受DM选择的故事奖励，如魔法物品或超自然的礼物。本侧边栏包含了关于如何将西伯利亚龙纹整合到DM不希望使用超自然礼物的游戏中的建议。",
	"The Siberys dragonmarks presented in this section are significantly more powerful than an Ability Score Improvement or a feat (which characters can take as early as 4th level) and should not be allowed for first or second tier characters. However, as a variant rule, a DM could choose to allow characters of 12th level or above to take a Siberys dragonmark instead of an Ability Score Improvement.": "本节中介绍的西伯利亚龙印比能力分数提高或特技（角色最早可以在4级时采取）要强大得多，因此不应该允许第一或第二层的角色使用。然而，作为一条变通规则，DM可以选择允许12级或以上的角色服用西伯利亚龙纹，而不是能力分数提升。",
	"Under Shared Campaign rules, players obtain magic items by spending treasure points based on the value of the item they are acquiring. If a DM chooses, they could allow players to \"purchase\" a Siberys dragonmark as if it were a magic item found on Magic Item Table G.": "在共享活动规则下，玩家通过花费基于他们所获得的物品价值的宝藏点来获得魔法物品。如果管理员选择，他们可以允许玩家 \"购买 \"西伯利亚龙纹，就像它是魔法物品表G上的魔法物品一样。",
	"This section presents a few items that use magic readily accessible to the skilled artificers of Eberron. The Aereni mask would generally only be crafted on the island of Aerenal, and only given to worthy Aereni elves. The rest might be purchased in the major cities of Khorvaire, though they might have limited quantities or require you to find an artificer willing to take a special commission.": "本节介绍了一些使用Eberron的熟练工匠可以轻易获得的魔法的物品。艾瑞尼面具一般只在艾瑞纳岛上制作，并且只给有价值的艾瑞尼精灵。其余的可以在霍尔韦尔的主要城市购买，尽管它们可能数量有限，或者需要你找到一个愿意接受特殊委托的工匠。",
	"The daelkyr create living tools and weapons, objects formed from chitin, bone, and muscle. Many of these items bond to their bearer, drawing sustenance from the creature attuned to them; for this reason, they are commonly called \"symbionts.\" Though symbionts are living tools, they are mechanically considered a magic item, not a creature.": "daelkyr创造了活的工具和武器，由甲壳素、骨头和肌肉形成的物体。许多这样的物品与它们的持有者结合在一起，从与它们相适应的生物那里获取养分；因此，它们通常被称为 \"共生体\"。虽然共生体是活的工具，但它们在机械上被认为是一种魔法物品，而不是一种生物。",
	"This section introduces eight new symbiont items, like those in chapter 5 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. In addition, you could present any existing magic item as a daelkyr-made symbiont by describing the item as being made from organic materials. A {@item dagger of venom} crafted by Valaara could be a chitin blade that's warm to the touch. A {@item cloak of the bat} might feel like membranous leather, with veins running through the material. A {@item periapt of wound closure} could be a scarab that burrows into the flesh of the bearer, enhancing their blood. Even common magic items can be symbionts; an {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} could be a sluglike creature with a luminescent body.": "本节介绍了八个新的共生体项目，就像{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}第五章中的那些。此外，你可以把任何现有的魔法物品作为daelkyr制造的共生体来介绍，把该物品描述为由有机材料制成。瓦拉拉制作的（1%）可以是一把触感温暖的甲壳素刀。{@item cloak of the bat}可能感觉像膜质皮革，有血管穿过材料。一个（3%）可能是钻进携带者的肉里的刀疤，增强他们的血液。即使是普通的魔法物品也可以成为共生体；一个{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}可以是一个拥有发光体的蛞蝓状生物。",
	"When presenting an existing item as a symbiont, the DM must decide whether to add the Symbiotic Nature feature that other symbionts have. When such an item is attuned, it can't be removed from the bearer, even if they desire it; the only way to end the attunement and remove a symbiont is to use an effect that ends a curse. This prevents the item from being taken away, but limits a character's free will, so it's up to the story you want to tell. While Symbiotic Nature is a common attribute for symbionts, it's not a requirement. A slug that functions as an {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} wouldn't require attunement. Even if the {@item periapt of wound closure} is a scarab that digs into the flesh of the bearer, perhaps it could be pried loose, or it might release its grip voluntarily if the bearer ends the attunement.": "当把一个现有的物品作为共生体呈现时，DM必须决定是否加入其他共生体所具有的共生性质特征。当这样的物品被附和时，它不能从持有者身上移走，即使他们想要这样做；结束附和并移走共生体的唯一方法是使用一个结束诅咒的效果。这可以防止物品被夺走，但限制了角色的自由意志，所以这取决于你想讲的故事。虽然共生性质是共生体的一个常见属性，但这并不是一个要求。一个作为{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}的蛞蝓就不需要调谐。即使{@item periapt of wound closure}是一个钻进携带者的肉里的刀疤，也许它可以被撬开，或者如果携带者结束调和，它可能会主动释放它的抓握。",

	"A daelkyr knows secrets mortals can't comprehend and has plans they can't understand. Some sages believe that the daelkyr are artists and that worlds are their canvas; they destroy civilizations and unleash monsters because, to them, this is a thing of beauty. Others say that the daelkyr exist beyond time, and that their actions only make sense when viewed over the course of millennia. Still others assert that any creature that can understand the motives of the daelkyr will immediately turn to their cause—that it is dangerous to study the daelkyr too closely, lest their revelations destroy all prior understanding and identity. While they may be enigmatic, the daelkyr are unquestionably evil; they shatter innocent lives and entire civilizations without any remorse.": "daelkyr知道凡人无法理解的秘密，有他们无法理解的计划。一些圣人认为，daelkyr是艺术家，世界是他们的画布；他们摧毁文明，释放怪物，因为对他们来说，这是一种美。还有人说，daelkyr存在于时间之外，他们的行为只有在经历了几千年的时间后才有意义。还有人断言，任何能理解达尔凯尔动机的生物都会立即转向他们的事业--对达尔凯尔的研究过于仔细是危险的，以免他们的启示破坏了所有先前的理解和身份。虽然他们可能是神秘的，但daelkyr无疑是邪恶的；他们粉碎了无辜的生命和整个文明，没有任何悔意。",
	"Each daelkyr has a unique theme; Belashyrra is tied to sight. Valaara to insects, and Dyrrn to corruption and evolution. This theme is reflected in the daelkyr's appearance, in the minions it employs, and in the symbionts it creates. If the daelkyr is an artist, the theme is its medium. If it's a conqueror, the theme defines its weapons and the world it seeks to create. Additionally, each daelkyr holds secrets and revelations relating to its specific theme—secrets mortal minds can't comprehend. While in Belashyrra's presence, people may remember things they've seen and forgotten. Around Valaara, they may feel insects burrowing through their flesh, or sense the thoughts of their allies—a momentary sensation of being part of a hive.": "每个daelkyr都有一个独特的主题；Belashyrra与视觉有关。Valaara与昆虫有关，Dyrrn与腐败和进化有关。这个主题反映在daelkyr的外表、它雇用的奴仆和它创造的共生体中。如果daelkyr是个艺术家，主题就是它的媒介。如果它是一个征服者，主题就决定了它的武器和它想要创造的世界。此外，每个daelkyr都有与其特定主题有关的秘密和启示--凡人无法理解的秘密。当在贝拉希拉面前时，人们可能会想起他们所看到的和遗忘的东西。在瓦拉拉身边，他们可能会感觉到昆虫钻过他们的肉体，或者感觉到他们盟友的思想--一种成为蜂巢一部分的瞬间感觉。",
	"In an encounter with a daelkyr, consider ways to express its alien nature, such as the following:": "在遇到daelkyr时，要考虑如何表达它的异类性质，比如说以下。",
	"A daelkyr can teleport 30 feet as a bonus action. This reflects the idea that the daelkyr are loosely bound to space and time. The daelkyr shifts in space, but you can't remember it moving. You could represent this as a constant, casual effect; even outside of combat, the daelkyr shifts between spaces, unbound by the concept of distance or time.": "达尔凯尔人可以将传送30英尺作为一个额外动作。这反映了daelkyr对空间和时间的约束是松散的。daelkyr在空间中移动，但你却不记得它在移动。你可以把这表现为一种持续的、随意的效果；即使在战斗之外，daelkyr也会在空间之间移动，不受距离或时间概念的约束。",
	"The appearance of a daelkyr is subjective. The basic facts are constant: a daelkyr is a Medium bipedal creature, and its equipment doesn't change. Beyond this, its appearance reflects its theme blended with its alien nature; for example, Valaara typically appears as an angelic humanoid merged with insect elements. But after people encounter a daelkyr, those who compare notes may find they disagree on the details. The daelkyr might appear as someone the viewer knows, or its appearance could shift mid-conversation. This is not something the daelkyr controls, and it's not considered a beneficial trait; it's simply part of their alien nature.": "daelkyr的外观是主观的。基本的事实是不变的：daelkyr是一个中等的双足生物，它的装备不会改变。除此以外，它的外观反映了它的主题与它的外星性质相融合；例如，瓦拉拉通常表现为一个融合了昆虫元素的天使人形。但在人们遇到daelkyr后，那些比较过的人可能会发现他们在细节上有不同的看法。daelkyr可能会以观众认识的人的身份出现，或者它的外观可能在对话中发生变化。这不是daelkyr所能控制的，而且这也不被认为是一种有益的特征；这只是他们异类本性的一部分。",
	"Daelkyr have telepathy with a range of 120 feet. This is their primary form of communication and is intended to be broader in scope than typical telepathy. A daelkyr can communicate with any number of creatures within range at once, projecting a thought much as other creatures project sound. Typically when a daelkyr \"speaks,\" all creatures receive the same message, but the DM might decide that one or more creatures receive a different message. And just as people see different things when they look at a daelkyr, two people can perceive a daelkyr's \"speech\" in very different ways. One may feel as though the daelkyr is speaking aloud with a strange, alien voice. Another may hear the speech of the daelkyr as the voice of a dead lover, whispering in their ear. Another may not be able to remember actually hearing the daelkyr speak; instead, they just remember its words existing, as if they've always known them.": "Daelkyr有心灵感应，范围为120英尺。这是他们主要的交流方式，目的是为了比典型的心灵感应范围更广。戴尔克尔可以同时与范围内的任何数量的生物交流，像其他生物投射声音一样投射思想。通常情况下，当daelkyr \"说话 \"时，所有生物都会收到相同的信息，但DM可能会决定一个或多个生物收到不同的信息。就像人们在看daelkyr时看到不同的东西一样，两个人对daelkyr的 \"说话 \"也会有非常不同的感知。一个人可能觉得daelkyr在用一种奇怪的、外来的声音大声说话。另一个人可能会把daelkyr的讲话听成是一个死去的情人的声音，在他们耳边低语。另一个人可能不记得真正听到过daelkyr说话；相反，他们只记得它的话语存在，仿佛他们一直都知道。",
	"The Alien Mind feature of the daelkyr reflects the idea that the way that the daelkyr experience reality is so alien that any creature who tries to read their thoughts—to see the universe as they do—may become catatonic.": "达尔凯尔的 \"异形之心 \"特征反映了达尔凯尔人体验现实的方式是如此陌生，以至于任何试图读懂他们的想法--像他们那样看待宇宙--的生物都可能变得紧张。",
	"Any encounter with a daelkyr should be horrifying, driven by its alien, unknowable nature. The actions of the Lords of Dust and the Dreaming Dark make sense; the quori seek to control humanity's dreams, while the Lords of Dust strive to release their bound overlords. The actions of the daelkyr are just as deadly and destructive, but we cannot understand what they want, and those who attempt to do so often become cultists.": "任何与达尔凯尔的相遇都应该是可怕的，这是由它的异形、不可知的性质所驱动的。尘土领主和梦幻黑暗的行动是有道理的；昆仑人试图控制人类的梦境，而尘土领主则努力释放他们被束缚的霸主。daelkyr的行为同样是致命的、破坏性的，但我们无法理解他们想要什么，而那些试图这样做的人往往会成为邪教分子。",
	"The fey emanate from Thelanis. The least among them embody the magic we wish to see in the world—the idea of spirits in the trees and wind, of mischievous sprites and satyrs dancing in the glades.

	"The quori are the spirits that rule Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. Quori are immortal, but they can be slain; when a quori dies, its essence returns to the Dreaming Dark, where it is reconstituted as a new spirit. Quori spirits are bound to emotions, and they feed on those emotions and excel at manipulating them in mortals. The tsucora thrive on fear, the hashalaq manipulate pleasure, the du'ulora are driven by anger, and the kalaraq consume pride and ambition. These are the most common quori, but there are many others; the spiteful tsoreva and the domineering usvapna have already been mentioned in previous editions.": "Quori是统治Dal Quor，即梦境地区的精神。奎里是不朽的，但它们可以被杀死；当奎里死亡时，它的精华会回到梦境的黑暗中，在那里被重新组合成一个新的精神。Quori的精神与情感紧密相连，它们以这些情感为食，并擅长操纵凡人的情感。tsucora以恐惧为生，hashalaq操纵快乐，du'ulora受愤怒驱使，而kalaraq则吞噬骄傲和野心。这些是最常见的Quori，但还有许多其他的；在以前的版本中已经提到过充满怨恨的tsoreva和专横的usvapna。",
	"The quori are the creations of il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that shapes Dal Quor. Cruelty is a part of their nature. However, when a quori is reborn, there is a microscopic chance that it will be touched by il-Yannah, the incarnation of light that will one day replace the Dreaming Dark. It's possible for a quori to carry this seed of light and never embrace it. The kalaraq Taratai was the first to rally those quori who could sense the light, teaching them to push back the darkness and embrace il-Yannah. These rebels are the spirits who are now bound to the kalashtar. They are still quori—tsucora, hashalaq, du'ulora, kalaraq—and they are still tied to the emotion associated with their quori type. But they are driven by their vision of the light that is to come rather than the darkness of the present. Taratai's rebels fled Dal Quor long ago, and there have surely been new quori touched by il-Yannah since then. But today, the Dreaming Dark are constantly policing their own ranks and searching for such \"corrupted\" spirits. Any that are found will be destroyed, so their spirits can be reborn as proper servants of il-Lashtavar.": "科里人是il-Lashtavar的创造物，是塑造达尔-库尔的邪恶力量。残忍是他们本性的一部分。然而，当一个昆利人重生时，有一个微小的机会，它将被伊尔-雅娜所触动，伊尔-雅娜是光明的化身，有一天将取代梦幻的黑暗。Quori有可能携带这颗光的种子，但却从未拥抱过它。卡拉格-塔拉泰是第一个召集那些能感觉到光明的库里人的人，教导他们击退黑暗，拥抱伊尔-扬纳。这些反叛者是现在被束缚在卡拉克塔拉的精神。他们仍然是quori-tsucora、hashalaq、du'ulora、kalaraq--他们仍然被与他们quori类型相关的情感所束缚。但他们被他们对即将到来的光明的憧憬所驱使，而不是现在的黑暗。塔拉泰的叛军很久以前就逃离了达尔-库尔，从那时起，肯定有新的库里被伊尔-扬纳触动。但是今天，梦想的黑暗正在不断地监督自己的队伍，并寻找这种 \"被腐蚀 \"的精神。任何被发现的都将被摧毁，因此他们的灵魂可以重生，成为il-Lashtavar的适当仆人。",
	"All quori have powerful psionic abilities. DMs could choose to represent this by granting each quori from {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} telepathy with a range of 120 feet.

	"Quori aren't biological creatures. They're immortal spirits, fragments of nightmare spawned by il-Lashtavar. They don't sleep, and they dine only on the emotions of mortals. They are known for their ability to possess other mortals, a reflection of their fundamentally spiritual nature. All of these make them quite different from creatures such as beholders or mind flayers—monsters that are deeply alien, but that are still formed of flesh and blood.": "科里不是生物。他们是不朽的灵魂，是由IL-Lashtavar催生的噩梦的碎片。他们不睡觉，只以凡人的情感为食。他们以拥有其他凡人的能力而闻名，这反映了他们基本的精神性质。所有这些都使他们与诸如 \"看守者 \"或 \"心灵剥落者 \"之类的生物截然不同--它们是深层次的异类，但仍然是由血肉之躯构成的怪物。",
	"The choice to classify quori as aberrations in fifth edition reflects the idea that \"aberration\" is a broad category including any entity that is fundamentally alien; and certainly, the quori have no place in the natural world. However, this has a number of concrete mechanical effects. Many effects that target evil spirits only affect fiends and undead. As aberrations, quori can't be detected by a paladin's Divine Sense or banished to Dal Quor with {@spell divine word}. The spells {@spell hallow} and {@spell forbiddance} don't protect against them. This was an intentional decision that renders quori immune to many of the tools that can be deployed against devils or demons. However, as a DM, you can choose to make quori fiends instead of aberrations if you want these spells and effects to be effective against them. Or you could compromise by leaving quori as aberrations, but say that clerics and paladins devoted to the Path of Light can affect quori with any spell or class feature that affects fiends. This keeps quori as mysterious and alien, and gives the Path of Light a unique role in battling them.": "在第五版中选择将 \"异形 \"归类为畸形，反映了 \"畸形 \"是一个广泛的类别，包括任何从根本上说是异形的实体；当然，\"异形 \"在自然界中没有地位。然而，这有一些具体的机械效应。许多针对邪灵的效果只影响魔族和亡灵。作为异类，奎里不能被圣骑士的神识探测到，也不能用（%0%）驱逐到达尔库尔。咒语{@spell hallow}和{@spell forbiddance}也不能保护他们。这是一个有意的决定，它使库里对许多可以用来对付魔鬼或恶魔的工具免疫。然而，作为DM，如果你想让这些法术和效果对他们有效，你可以选择让奎里成为恶魔而不是畸形。或者你可以折中一下，让夸里成为反常者，但说致力于光明之路的牧师和圣骑士可以用任何影响恶魔的法术或类别特征来影响夸里。这样就能保持奎里的神秘性和异类性，并使光明之路在与它们的战斗中扮演一个独特的角色。",

Those touched by Valaara may undergo a physical metamorphosis and manifest insect traits, but Valaara's touch can also transform the mind. Some who hear the whispers of the Crawling Queen become fascinated by insects, while others suffer more dramatic transformations. Valaara's most persistent cults spread by forming a hive; one creature becomes the queen, and others touched by this cultist find their original personality and desires fading, consumed by the need to fulfill their purpose in the hive. Usually this effect is limited, a psychic connection that only binds a few people; but in a few cases, this psychic contagion has been virulent and contagious, consuming entire towns.": "瓦拉拉在各方面都体现了昆虫的异类性质。瓦拉拉的共生体可能是由甲壳素形成的，但它也有一些创造物，如咒语洞穴和投掷猩球（详见第七章）--这些昆虫会钻入携带者的皮肤。被瓦拉拉触碰的人可能会经历身体的蜕变，表现出昆虫的特征，但瓦拉拉的触碰也能改变人的思想。一些听到爬行女王的低语的人变得对昆虫着迷，而另一些人则遭受更戏剧性的转变。瓦拉拉最持久的邪教通过形成一个蜂巢来传播；一个生物成为女王，其他被这个邪教者触及的人发现他们原来的个性和欲望逐渐消失，被完成他们在蜂巢中的目的的需要所吞噬。通常这种影响是有限的，是一种只与少数人结合的精神联系；但在少数情况下，这种精神传染病具有毒性和传染性，会吞噬整个城镇。",
	"The cults of the Crawling Queen are described in detail in chapter 3. Valaara doesn't use dolgaunts or dolgrims; rather, it often transforms humanoids into insect forms. These creatures use the statistics of thri-kreen, driders, or umber hulks, but their appearance can vary dramatically; a group of servitors could be roach-people as opposed to the typical mantis form of the thri-kreen. In other places it works through consuming worms, producing creatures with the statistics of spawn of Kyuss. In general, Valaara may employ any sort of creature thematically related to insects or worms, from simple swarms and giant spiders to carrion crawlers, ankhegs, remorhazes, or even purple worms. But these monsters should be seen as a starting point. Like all daelkyr, Valaara is constantly experimenting and creating new things. Imagine a purple worm with malign intelligence and psychic powers, or teleporting ankhegs that burrow through the fabric of space.": "爬行女王的邪教在第三章有详细描述。瓦拉拉不使用多尔衮或多尔格林姆；相反，它经常将人类转化为昆虫形态。这些生物使用特里格林（thri-kreen）、钻头（driders）或乌尔克（umber hulks）的统计数据，但它们的外观可以有很大的不同；一群仆人可能是蟑螂人，而不是典型的特里格林的螳螂形态。在其他地方，它通过吞噬蠕虫来工作，产生具有Kyuss产卵统计学特征的生物。一般来说，瓦拉拉可以使用任何一种与昆虫或蠕虫有关的主题生物，从简单的虫群和巨型蜘蛛到腐尸爬行者、安克赫斯、雷莫哈兹，甚至是紫色蠕虫。但这些怪物应该被看作是一个起点。像所有的daelkyr一样，Valaara正在不断地进行实验，创造新的东西。想象一下，一个具有恶性智能和精神力量的紫色蠕虫，或者在空间结构中钻行的远距离传送的Ankhegs。",
	"Like other daelkyr, Valaara is bound within a demiplane in Khyber. However, Valaara has bred burrowing worms that chew through the fabric of reality, carving a web of passages between her Deepest Hive and the world above. An organization that discovers the upper layers of these tunnels could use them to move swiftly across the world, entering a tunnel in the Lhazaar Principalities, traveling five miles, and emerging in Sarlona or the Eldeen Reaches. Smugglers or explorers might make use of this wonder, never knowing what lies in the deeper tunnels—until Valaara's minions seize them, or until they are consumed by the psychic influence of the Crawling Queen. While tunnels to the Deepest Hive can appear anywhere that suits the story, they are also less permanent than the ties between Eberron and the realms of many other daelkyr. A tunnel to the Deepest Hive can appear wherever it suits the needs of a story, but it's also possible to collapse a passage and break a connection.": "像其他daelkyr一样，Valaara被束缚在Khyber的一个半位面中。然而，瓦拉拉培育的钻地虫咬破了现实的结构，在她最深的蜂巢和上面的世界之间刻画了一张通道网。一个发现这些隧道上层的组织可以利用它们迅速穿越世界，进入拉扎尔公国的隧道，行驶5英里，然后出现在萨洛纳或艾尔迪恩河谷。走私者或探险家可能会利用这个奇迹，永远不知道更深的隧道里有什么--直到瓦拉拉的爪牙抓住他们，或者直到他们被爬行女王的精神影响所吞噬。虽然通往最深蜂巢的隧道可以出现在任何适合故事的地方，但它们也不像Eberron和许多其他daelkyr的领域之间的联系那样永久。通往最深蜂巢的隧道可以出现在任何适合故事需要的地方，但也有可能使通道坍塌，中断连接。",
	"The upper tunnels of Valaara's realm are usually formed of fused glass-like material, then as explorers delve deeper, they find the walls formed of chitin and muscle, with insects swarming across every surface. One might discover pulsing cocoons, nests of slumbering purple worms, or chambers lined with thousands of glowing eggs.

	"There was a time when the world was the wood, when there were no towns or steel. The Forest Queen ruled the Endless Weald, maintaining peace between people and beasts.

I want to build a fortress and wield a blade of steel.\" The Queen replied, \"Then leave the wood, but do not bring your metal into my domain.\" And so he left the wood and founded the kingdom of Karrnath. The next day the eldest daughter came before the Queen. \"Mother, I dream of magic! I want to build a tower and conjure fire!\" The Queen replied, \"Then leave the wood, but do not cast your spells in my domain.\" And so she left the wood and founded the kingdom of Thaliost. One by one, the Queen's children left her, until she was alone in the woods with the spirits and the beasts. And as each child raised a kingdom, the woods grew smaller and farther apart, and the heart of the Forest Queen grew bitter and cold. The people are her great-grandchildren, and she will not harm those who stay on the path and respect the beasts of the forest. But those who stray from the path, who conjure fire or hunt with steel, those fools will be lost in the Endless Weald and never again see the light of day.": "曾几何时，世界是森林，没有城镇和钢铁。森林女王统治着无尽的荒野，维持着人类和野兽之间的和平。但随着时间的推移，她的孩子们在她的树荫下变得不安分。她的长子来到她面前，说：\"母亲，我梦想着战争！我想建立一个堡垒，让我的孩子们在这里生活。我想建造一座堡垒，挥舞着钢刀\"。王后回答说：\"那就离开树林，但不要把你的金属带入我的领域。\" 于是，他离开了树林，建立了卡尔纳特王国。第二天，大女儿来到女王面前。\"母亲，我梦见了魔法! 我想建造一座塔，并施展火焰！\" 女王回答说：\"那就离开这片树林，但不要在我的领地内施展你的法术。\" 于是，她离开了树林，建立了塔利奥斯特王国。女王的孩子们一个接一个地离开了她，直到她独自一人在树林里与鬼魂和野兽在一起。随着每个孩子都建立了一个王国，树林越来越小，距离越来越远，森林女王的心也越来越苦，越来越冷。人们是她的曾孙，她不会伤害那些留在道路上并尊重森林里的野兽的人。但是，那些偏离道路的人，那些用火施法或用钢铁打猎的人，这些傻瓜将在无尽的荒原上迷失，再也见不到阳光了。",
	"From the Towering Wood in the Eldeen Reaches to the Harrowcrowns of Thrane, from the Greenhaunt of Breland to the Shadowmount Forest of Karrnath, wherever people dwell by the deep forest, they share stories of the Forest Queen. She is the archdryad, linked to every root and bough. She is proud, and when protecting her subjects, she can be ruthless; but she shares many wonders with those who enter her woods with empty hands and open eyes. The story above is clearly apocryphal, but it's a common tale with many variations, such as her children founding nearby towns instead of nations. Regardless, the message is the same: {@i there is a power that watches over the woods}. Stories often depend on the character of the local forest; near the Towering Woods, the Forest Queen is often depicted as benevolent, while near the Nightwood of Karrnath, they talk of how the betrayals of her children froze the heart of the Forest Queen, leaving her cruel and hungry for revenge.": "从Eldeen Reaches的Towering Wood到Thrane的Harrowcrowns，从Breland的Greenhaunt到Karrnath的Shadowmount Forest，无论人们居住在森林深处，都会分享森林女王的故事。她是大树，与每一根树根和树枝相连。她很骄傲，在保护她的臣民时，她可能是无情的；但她与那些空手进入她的森林并睁开眼睛的人分享许多奇迹。上面的故事显然是天方夜谭，但这是一个常见的故事，有许多变化，例如她的孩子们建立了附近的城镇而不是国家。不管怎么样，信息是一样的：（%0%）。故事往往取决于当地森林的特点；在高耸的森林附近，森林女王往往被描绘成仁慈的，而在卡尔纳斯的夜林附近，他们谈论的是她的孩子们的背叛如何冻结了森林女王的心，使她变得残忍，渴望复仇。",
	"The Forest Queen rules the Endless Weald within Thelanis, an arboreal realm inhabited by dire beasts and wild fey. The Weald often leaks into the wood through manifest zones found in deep forests; in such places, dryads lurk in the trees and beasts may possess unusual cunning. Under the right circumstances, travelers passing through a zone might even slip into the Weald. Such forests typically have well-worn paths that avoid these pitfalls, thus strengthening the story of stay on the path. The Greensinger druids know rituals to connect a forest to the Endless Weald, establishing a temporary manifest zone in any deep wood. The Queen's influence can also be felt in any forest in times when Eberron and Thelanis are coterminous. Just like the stories, the Queen's personality often reflects the forest where she's currently manifesting; the Forest Queen is more likely to be benevolent in the Twilight Demesne and cruel in the Nightwood.": "森林女王统治着Thelanis的无尽荒原，这是一个由可怕的野兽和野生精灵居住的树状领域。荒原经常通过森林深处的显化区渗入森林；在这些地方，干尸潜伏在树上，野兽可能拥有不寻常的狡猾。在适当的情况下，经过某个区域的旅行者甚至可能溜进森林。这样的森林通常有磨损良好的道路，可以避开这些陷阱，从而加强留在路上的故事。格林辛格的德鲁伊们知道一些仪式，可以将森林与无尽的荒原连接起来，在任何深山老林中建立一个临时的显灵区。在艾伯伦和塞拉尼斯共存的时候，也可以在任何森林中感受到女王的影响。就像故事中一样，女王的个性往往反映了她目前所显现的森林；森林女王在暮光之城更可能是仁慈的，而在夜林则是残忍的。",
	"The Forest Queen has close ties to the Greensingers, and any Greensinger druid or ranger could have the Forest Queen as a patron. She's an option for a warlock with an Archfey patron, but the magic she teaches is primal in nature, not arcane. This doesn't change the spells available to the warlock; their spells simply draw on elemental forces and the power of the fey rather than arcane formulas. As a more exotic option, a character with the Outlander background could have slipped into the Endless Weald as a child and been raised in the court of the Forest Queen.": "森林女王与绿心人关系密切，任何绿心人德鲁伊或游侠都可以将森林女王作为守护者。她是一个拥有大法师守护者的术士的选择，但她所教授的魔法在本质上是原始的，而不是奥术。这并不改变术士可用的法术；他们的法术只是利用了元素的力量和精灵的力量，而不是奥术公式。作为一个更具异国情调的选择，一个具有《外乡人》背景的人物可以在童年时溜进无尽荒原，在森林女王的宫廷中长大。",
	"Regardless of origin, any character allied with the Forest Queen is expected to follow her rules.": "无论出身如何，任何与森林女王结盟的角色都应遵守她的规则。",
	"Don't use weapons or armor of metal.": "不要使用金属的武器或盔甲。",

	"Help any fey of the forest who comes to you in need.": "帮助任何向你求助的森林中的精灵。",
	"Beyond these basic principles, the Forest Queen's quests typically relate to the woods in some way. An agent of the Forest Queen could be tasked to reconsecrate a grove, to destroy an infestation of aberrations or other unnatural predators, or to prevent an ambitious dragonmarked house from expanding into woodlands. Beyond the forest, an agent could be tasked to recover a relic stolen from the Endless Weald (and once reclaimed, perhaps entrusted to carry this artifact on their adventures). Agents of the Forest Queen might be charged to act as envoys, negotiating with agents of other archfey or dealing with the Feyspires. Or perhaps there's a darkness in the Endless Weald, a canker that appeared when the forests of Cyre were consumed by the Mourning. The Forest Queen could task mortals to explore this region within the Weald, or charge them to explore the Mournland and to seek a cure for the wounded land.": "除了这些基本原则，森林女王的任务通常以某种方式与森林有关。森林女王的代理人可能会被要求重新祭祀一片树林，消灭畸形动物或其他非自然掠食者的侵扰，或者阻止一个雄心勃勃的龙纹屋向林地扩张。在森林之外，代理人可能会被要求找回从无尽荒原偷来的遗物（一旦找回，也许会被委托带着这个神器去冒险）。森林女王的代理人可能会被任命为特使，与其他大公国的代理人谈判或与费斯皮尔打交道。也许无尽荒原上有一种黑暗，当赛尔的森林被哀伤所吞噬时，出现了一种腐烂。森林女王可以委派凡人去探索荒原内的这个区域，或者责成他们去探索哀伤之地，为受伤的土地寻找治疗方法。",
	"One could make an enemy of the Queen by breaking one of her rules while in her woods, or perhaps by killing one of her favored beasts or devoted agents. Such a personal enmity could lead to a character being targeted by natural threats—singled out by aggressive beasts, led astray on journeys through wild regions, or targeted by malicious sprites. A character could also earn her ire by taking one of her relics from a forest, perhaps not knowing that the magic item is tied to the wood. On a larger scale, the Forest Queen could grow tired of civilization itself. The forests containing her manifest zones could expand, with fey and feral beasts attacking villages and towns as they're overgrown. Could adventurers find a way to placate the bitter Queen, or must they defeat her to end this advance?": "一个人可以通过在女王的森林中违反她的规则，或者通过杀死她宠爱的野兽或忠实的代理人而成为女王的敌人。这样的个人恩怨可能会导致角色成为自然威胁的目标--被攻击性的野兽勾引出来，在野外旅行中误入歧途，或者被恶意的精灵盯上。一个角色也可能因为从森林中拿走她的一件遗物而招致她的愤怒，也许他不知道这个魔法物品是与木材联系在一起的。在更大的范围内，森林女王可能对文明本身感到厌倦。含有她的显露区的森林可能会扩大，当它们长满杂草时，精灵和野性的野兽会攻击村庄和城镇。冒险家们能否找到一种方法来安抚痛苦的女王，或者他们必须击败她来结束这种进展？",
	"The Forest Queen charges those who follow her rules to never kill with steel or wear metal armor. This can be a serious limitation for a ranger or other character that has access to martial weapons or medium or heavy armor. However, they could seek out equipment of bronzewood,an exotic lumber that only grows in Aerenal and in a few groves hidden deep in the Towering Wood. This exceptionally dense wood can be used to fashion armor without metal, which could use the same statistics as any medium or heavy armor. Arrows and crowssbow bolts can also be fashioned from {@i bronzewood}, and this exceptionally durable ammunition breaks no more often than its steel counterpart. Similarly, {@i leafweave} armor is made from alchemically treated leaves of the bronzewood tree, and can offer the same level of protection as studded leather or a chain shirt.": "森林女王要求那些遵守她的规则的人永远不要用钢铁杀人或穿金属盔甲。这对游侠或其他可以使用武术武器或中、重型盔甲的角色来说是一个严重的限制。然而，他们可以寻找青铜木的装备，这是一种只在阿伦纳和隐藏在高耸森林深处的少数树林中生长的异国木材。这种特别致密的木材可以用来制造不含金属的盔甲，它可以使用与任何中型或重型盔甲相同的统计数据。箭和弓箭也可以用{@i bronzewood}来制造，这种特别耐用的弹药不会比它的钢制对应物更经常断裂。同样，(1%)盔甲是由经过炼金术处理的青铜树叶制成的，可以提供与镶钉皮革或链式衬衫相同的保护水平。",
	"Armor and weapons made using these substances are generally only available in Aerenal or within the Towering Woods, but if it fits a character's background, the DM could choose to allow a character's starting equipment to be made from such materials. Another option is a weapon formed from the bones of a monstrosity; here again, the principle is that the weapon is mechanically identical to a standard weapon, but doesn't violate the Forest Queen's ban on metal. If a character is using a bone weapon, there should certainly be a story to it: What creature is it from? Who killed the beast and shaped the weapon, and how did the character come by it?": "使用这些物质制造的盔甲和武器通常只能在阿伦纳或高耸的森林内获得，但如果符合角色的背景，DM可以选择允许角色的起始装备由这种材料制成。另一个选择是用怪兽的骨头做成的武器；在这里，原则是该武器在机械上与标准武器相同，但不违反森林女王对金属的禁令。如果一个角色使用的是骨质武器，当然应该有一个故事。它来自什么生物？谁杀死了野兽并塑造了这个武器，角色是如何得到它的？",
	"The Forest Queen watches over the Endless Weald in Thelanis. Fauns and dryads dance in clearings lit by gleaming sprites, and peaceful beasts congregate by glittering springs. A series of path connects the safe spaces within the woods.

Even when he saved the kingdom from a cruel dragon, the people assumed one of his brothers had done the deed. But in that dragon's lair, the prince discovered a strange sack. Reaching inside it, he found a toy he'd loved as a child and long forgotten about, a comb lost by his sister, and a map of a nation that no longer exists. Curious, he climbed into the sack and found a castle within it, filled with forgotten wonders. No one ever noticed he was gone, and no one remembers his name or his deeds. But the Forgotten Prince still dwells in his Castle of Lost Things. When you forget something you love, or when something you need is nowhere to be found, it's because the Forgotten Prince has taken it for his hoard.": "曾经有一个大国的王子，是八个儿子中最小的一个。他的兄弟们被誉为王国的英雄，但无论最小的王子做了什么，他的事迹从未被注意到；他的兄弟们留下的阴影太长了。甚至当他从一条残酷的龙手中拯救王国时，人们也认为是他的一个兄弟干的。但在那条龙的巢穴里，王子发现了一个奇怪的麻袋。伸手进去，他发现了一个他小时候喜欢的玩具，但早已忘记了，还有一把他姐姐丢失的梳子，以及一张不复存在的国家地图。出于好奇，他爬进麻袋，发现里面有一座城堡，充满了被遗忘的奇迹。没有人注意到他的离开，也没有人记得他的名字和他的事迹。但被遗忘的王子仍然住在他的失物城堡里。当你忘记了你喜欢的东西，或者当你需要的东西无处可寻时，那是因为被遗忘的王子把它带到了他的仓库里。",

Often such thefts are never noticed, but he might take things that are quite valuable if he believes them to be unloved or unappreciated by those who have them. Sometimes this is done to teach a lesson, how the loss of a simple and undervalued item or idea can have disastrous consequences. Battles have been lost and cities fallen because of the Prince's thefts—though often people fail to appreciate the lesson, as they never recall what was lost to begin with.": "当袜子丢失或工具放错地方时，人们会咒骂被遗忘的王子偷走了它。当有人忘记了他们要说的话，他们可能会说 \"王子拿走了我的思想\"。不用说，他的势力范围并不像这些故事所描述的那样广泛；但被遗忘的王子和他的爪牙确实偷了不被重视的东西，包括物质物品，甚至思想本身，把它们保存在他的失物城堡的金库和图书馆中。这种偷窃通常不会被注意到，但如果他认为拥有这些东西的人不爱或不欣赏，他可能会拿走相当有价值的东西。有时这样做是为了给人上一课，一个简单的、被低估的物品或想法的丢失会带来灾难性的后果。由于王子的偷窃行为，战斗已经失败，城市已经沦陷--尽管人们往往不能理解这个教训，因为他们从来没有想起一开始失去的是什么。",
	"The Forgotten Prince dwells in the Castle of Lost Things in Thelanis. His attendants are sly and cunning fey, along with mortals who were unappreciated in their mundane lives. Some say that the kenku are servants of the Forgotten Prince who fled from his service—that he stole their voices as punishment for their betrayal, but that a kenku can earn it back with clever deeds. True or not, the Prince has followers scattered across Khorvaire—thieves who sacrifice unloved objects and undervalued secrets to the Prince in exchange for his guidance and gifts. Followers of the Forgotten Prince rarely work together, but they can be found in many positions of influence. There are elves in the Shadow Houses who receive visions from the Prince when they trance, and changelings among the Tyrants of Sharn who engage in more subtle thefts on behalf of the Prince, stealing hearts or faces. While his thefts often go unnoticed by the greater world, the Forgotten Prince also takes pleasure in seeing celebrated people whose reputations are undeserved brought low, and his agents may act to expose such poseurs. Adventurers could also be forced to deal with the Prince if he has something they need—perhaps an artifact or secret long forgotten, now sealed away in the vaults of his dark castle.": "被遗忘的王子居住在Thelanis的失落之物的城堡里。他的随从是狡猾狡猾的费伊人，还有那些在世俗生活中不被重视的凡人。有人说肯库是被遗忘的王子的仆人，他们逃离了他的服务--他偷走了他们的声音作为对他们背叛的惩罚，但肯库可以通过聪明的行为赚回它。无论真假，王子的追随者散布在霍尔韦尔各地--那些向王子献上不受欢迎的物品和被低估的秘密以换取他的指导和礼物的盗贼。被遗忘的王子的追随者很少一起工作，但他们可以在许多有影响力的位置上找到。影子屋里的精灵们在恍惚时能从王子那里得到幻觉，而沙恩暴君中的变革者则代表王子从事更微妙的偷窃，偷取人心或面孔。虽然他的偷窃行为往往不被大世界所注意，但被遗忘的王子也乐于看到那些名声不佳的人被贬低，他的代理人可能会采取行动来揭露这些装腔作势的人。如果王子有他们需要的东西，冒险者也可能被迫与他打交道--也许是一件早已被遗忘的文物或秘密，现在被封存在他黑暗城堡的地下室里。",
	"The Forgotten Prince may reach out to people who have themselves been forgotten or unappreciated, provided he sees potential in them. Sometimes he brings them to the Castle of Lost Things; in other cases, he offers these agents purpose, rewarding them for their service with gifts or secrets.

The Forgotten Prince could be an Archfey patron for a warlock, or a Hexblade warlock could also receive their weapon as a gift from the Prince; what is the forgotten history and destiny of this weapon? The Forgotten Prince can also be an interesting patron for a bard of the College of Lore; the Prince values secrets no one else considers valuable, and the Cutting Words feature can be depicted as stealing opportunity from a foe—a trick taught by the Forgotten Prince. The Forgotten Prince could teach a rogue the talents of an Arcane Trickster or the skills of a Thief, provided they are willing to use those skills on his behalf.Missions issued by the Prince typically involve the theft of an object or a secret. These things may not be seen as valuable by the people that possess them, and such a task could easily be added on top of the mission for an existing adventure—\"While you're in Dreadhold, steal the ring under the warden's bed.\" The Prince could teach his agents a ten-minute ritual which allows him to pull the requested item into Thelanis (this only works with objects the Prince wants, so it's not a way to dispose of just any item). The Prince may also task agents with actions to expose or bring down people whose reputations are undeserved, or to assist those who are unappreciated. Note that good and evil don't enter into these judgments; the Prince could call on agents to bring down someone who's using their undeserved reputation for a good cause, or to help an unappreciated serial killer!": "被遗忘的王子可能会接触到那些自己被遗忘或不被重视的人，只要他看到他们的潜力。有时他把他们带到失落之物城堡；在其他情况下，他为这些代理人提供目的，用礼物或秘密奖励他们的服务。对于被世界遗忘但被王子选中的人来说，顽童背景是一个很好的选择，而隐士背景可以反映出一个在失落之物城堡中度过了大部分生活的人，其发现特征与他们在城堡中发现的一个早已被遗忘的秘密或文物有关。被遗忘的王子可以是一个术士的大法师赞助人，或者一个六角刀术士也可以从王子那里得到他们的武器作为礼物；这个武器有什么被遗忘的历史和命运？被遗忘的王子也可以成为传说学院吟游诗人的一个有趣的赞助人；王子重视别人不认为有价值的秘密，而 \"切语 \"功能可以被描述为从敌人那里偷取机会--这是被遗忘的王子教给他的技巧。被遗忘的王子可以教给流氓奥术师的才能或盗贼的技能，只要他们愿意为他使用这些技能。王子发布的任务通常涉及盗窃一件物品或一个秘密。这些东西可能不被拥有它们的人视为有价值的东西，这样的任务可以很容易地加在现有冒险的任务之上--\"当你在Dreadhold时，偷取典狱长床下的戒指。\" 王子可以教他的代理人一个十分钟的仪式，让他把所要求的物品拉到Thelanis（这只对王子想要的物品有效，所以这不是一个处理任何物品的方法）。王子也可以委派代理人采取行动，揭露或打倒那些名声不好的人，或帮助那些不受重视的人。请注意，善与恶不在这些判断之列；王子可以要求特工人员打倒那些利用其不应有的名声做善事的人，或者帮助那些不受重视的连环杀手！这也是王子的职责所在。",
	"The simplest way for the Prince to enter a story is for one of his agents to steal something that the adventurers need, or to take actions that cripple an organization or patron that the characters work for. This ties to the idea that the Prince may target someone with an undeserved reputation even if they are using it to do good; the adventurers themselves could be targeted if they acquire fame that the Prince considers unearned. Or the characters might discover they need something stolen long ago by the Prince—or an object they've recently acquired and desperately need has gone missing, and no one else seems to remember it. Characters could also be set against the Prince by another immortal patron; perhaps the Prince has stolen one of the memories of the Forest Queen, and she wants it back.": "王子进入故事的最简单的方式是让他的一个代理人偷取冒险者需要的东西，或者采取削弱人物工作的组织或赞助人的行动。这与王子可能针对拥有不应有的名声的人的想法有关，即使他们利用名声做好事；如果冒险者获得了王子认为不应该得到的名声，他们自己也可能成为目标。或者人物可能会发现他们需要的东西很久以前就被王子偷走了，或者他们最近获得的急需的东西不见了，而其他人似乎都不记得它。角色也可能被另一个不朽的赞助人陷害；也许王子偷了森林女王的一段记忆，而她想要回来。",
	"A defining part of the Forgotten Prince's story is that he himself has been forgotten. Should a character somehow learn the true name of the Forgotten Prince during their adventures, they gain advantage on saving throws against all of his lair actions.": "被遗忘的王子的故事的一个决定性部分是他自己已经被遗忘。如果一个角色在冒险过程中知道了被遗忘的王子的真名，那么他们在面对他所有的巢穴行动时都会获得救赎的优势。",
	"The Prince dwells in the Castle of Forgotten Things in Thelanis. The castle seems to be its own distinct layer of Thelanis; if it exists in some other realm, its location has been forgotten. There are no doors that allow exit from the castle, and all windows are sealed and show scenes of places that have been forgotten. The only way to enter or leave the castle is through magic, whether by spell, through a manifest zone, or through a portal. Such portals can take many forms, such as the sack described in the legend above; normal people forget the location of a portal within an hour of discovering it, though player characters and other remarkable people could be immune to this effect. It's possible characters could discover that what they assumed to be a normal {@item bag of holding} can serve as a portal to the Castle of Lost Things.": "王子居住在塞拉尼斯的 \"被遗忘的事物城堡\"。城堡似乎是Thelanis的一个独特的层次；如果它存在于其他领域，它的位置已经被遗忘。城堡里没有可以出去的门，所有的窗户都是密封的，显示的是已经被遗忘的地方的场景。进入或离开城堡的唯一方法是通过魔法，无论是通过咒语、通过显灵区，还是通过门户。这种传送门可以有多种形式，比如上面传说中的麻袋；正常人在发现传送门的一小时内就会忘记它的位置，不过玩家角色和其他杰出人物可能会对这种影响免疫。角色有可能发现，他们以为是普通的（%0%）可以作为通往失落之物城堡的门户。",

It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.": "熔合体从物质位面进入虚空位面，或反之亦然。当它在边界空灵界时，它在物质界是可见的，反之亦然，但它不能影响或被另一界的任何东西所影响。",
	"A meld is formed from the faded souls of mortals—husks whose memories have been consumed by Dolurrh. These husks are typically harmless, but sometimes an aggressive nucleus gathers other husks, forming a deadly gestalt. In essence, a meld is a fusion of half-formed ghosts; it has an amorphous shape, with vague faces and limbs projecting from the mass, then being consumed once more. It makes no sound when it moves, but mortals around a meld hear cries of pain, pleading voices, and unearthly moans. Its Conflicted Soul action reflects it projecting some of its husks into a mortal body, temporarily overwhelming the victim with conflicting desires and visions.": "融合是由凡人消逝的灵魂形成的--他们的记忆已经被多鲁尔吞噬。这些外壳通常是无害的，但有时一个有侵略性的核心会聚集其他外壳，形成一个致命的格式塔。从本质上讲，融合体是半成品鬼魂的融合；它有一个无定形的形状，模糊的面孔和肢体从一团中投射出来，然后再一次被吞噬。它在移动时不会发出任何声音，但在融合体周围的凡人会听到痛苦的呼喊、恳求的声音和非人间的呻吟。它的 \"灵魂冲突 \"行动反映了它将自己的一些躯壳投射到凡人的身体中，用冲突的欲望和幻觉暂时压倒受害者。",
	"Melds are born in Dolurrh, and prowl the endless caverns searching for scraps of memory. This hunger can draw them to Eberron through manifest zones or when planes are coterminous. A meld can also manifest when someone is raised from the dead, following in the wake of the soul being drawn back to the world of the living. Melds that enter Eberron rarely stray more than one mile from the point where they arrived.": "Melds在Dolurrh出生，并在无尽的洞穴中游荡，寻找记忆的碎片。这种饥饿感可以通过显化区或平面相接时将他们吸引到Eberron。当有人从死里复活时，融合体也会显现出来，跟随灵魂的脚步被吸引回活人的世界。进入Eberron的融合体很少会离开他们到达的地方超过1英里。",
	"A meld has the barest traces of dozens of souls. It remembers scraps of the most powerful moments of its component husks, but it can't place these in any context. The meld yearns to consume other spirits, to feast on their memories and emotions. While highly unusual, it's possible for a powerful personality within a meld to exert temporary control; this might cause the meld to pursue a particular individual or draw it to a specific location. When a meld kills a living creature and consumes its spirit, the flood of memories can also shift the purpose of the meld, as it suddenly acts on the desires of its most recent victim. A meld loose in Eberron retains the spirits it consumes, preventing them from transitioning to Dolurrh. This prevents the spirit from fading; a character could hear the whispers of a trapped spirit within a meld, and a husk could hold the souls of people who died long ago. A side effect of this is that creatures slain by a meld cannot be resurrected or raised from the dead until the meld is destroyed.": "一个融合体有几十个灵魂的最原始的痕迹。它记得其组成部分的外壳中最强大的时刻的碎片，但它无法将这些放在任何背景中。熔合体渴望吞噬其他灵魂，享用它们的记忆和情感。虽然非常不寻常，但融合体中的强大人格有可能施加暂时的控制；这可能导致融合体追求某个特定的人，或把它吸引到一个特定的地点。当一个融合体杀死一个生物并吞噬其精神时，记忆的泛滥也会改变融合体的目的，因为它突然按照最近的受害者的欲望行事。Eberron中松动的融合体保留了它所消耗的精神，防止它们过渡到Dolurrh。这可以防止精神消逝；一个角色可以听到一个被困在熔合体中的精神的低语，而一个躯壳可以容纳很久以前死去的人的灵魂。这样做的一个副作用是，被融合体杀死的生物不能复活或起死回生，直到融合体被摧毁。",

	"The Doldarun dwarves say that any contact with the Realms Below corrupts the Mror. There's one recent development that supports their argument—the occasional birth of ruinbound dwarves among the Mror clans. The ruinbound dwarf is born with a personal symbiont—an unnatural entity bound to the child. Unlike most symbionts, this entity cannot be separated from its host, and the two are permanently fused. Many ruinbound dwarves have additional disturbing mutations; you can roll on the Ruinbound Mutations table for ideas, or create your own. These secondary mutations are disturbing, but they don't change the rules of how that character is played or grant mechanical benefits. For example, even if a ruinbound dwarf seems to have no eyes, their vision uncannily works as well as any other dwarf, though it defies logic.": "多尔达伦矮人说，任何与下层世界的接触都会使莫洛人堕落。最近的一个发展支持了他们的论点--在摩尔氏族中偶尔会诞生一些被毁灭的矮人。被毁灭的矮人出生时有一个个人共生体--一个与孩子绑定的非自然实体。与大多数共生体不同，这个实体不能与它的宿主分离，两者是永久融合的。许多被毁灭的矮人都有额外的令人不安的变异；你可以在被毁灭的变异表上打分，或者创造自己的想法。这些次要的变异是令人不安的，但它们不会改变该角色的游戏规则，也不会给予机械上的好处。例如，即使一个被废墟包围的矮人看起来没有眼睛，他们的视力也会不可思议地和其他矮人一样好，尽管这违反了逻辑。",

	"To date, no one knows the origin or purpose—if any—of the ruinbound dwarves. Doldarun asserts that they are children corrupted by Dyrrn in the womb, tools of the daelkyr waiting to be activated. The sages of Clan Narathun say that they may indeed be the result of strange forces emanating from the Realm Below, but there's no evidence that the children have any direct tie to the daelkyr or that they're drawn to malefic actions. Regardless of the truth, ruinbound dwarves are a recent development. The first ruinbound children were born thirty years ago, and traditionally, dwarves aren't even considered to be adults until their fiftieth year; however, ruinbound children mature surprisingly (some say unnaturally) quickly.": "迄今为止，没有人知道废墟中的矮人的起源或目的，如果有的话。多尔达伦断言，他们是在子宫中被Dyrrn腐蚀的孩子，是等待被激活的daelkyr的工具。纳拉逊氏族的圣人说，他们可能确实是来自下界的奇怪力量的结果，但没有证据表明这些孩子与达尔凯尔有任何直接联系，也没有证据表明他们被邪恶的行为所吸引。无论真相如何，与废墟相连的矮人是最近的发展。第一批废墟地带的孩子是在30年前出生的，传统上，矮人在50岁之前甚至不被认为是成年人；然而，废墟地带的孩子成熟得出奇的快（有人说是不自然的）。",
	"Ruinbound dwarves are quite rare and can be born to dwarves of any bloodline. The Mror still don't know what to make of them, though their attitude toward symbionts generally mirrors that toward ruinbound dwarves. The Doldarun dwarves are hostile to any ruinbounds that come to their land, and claim that ruinbound children are never born in their clan; while that's a possibility, there are also rumors of Soldorak agents among the Doldarun that spirit away these infants to a clan that celebrates them, lest they meet a darker fate. The Droranath and Toldorath clans are curious, but they won't necessarily ostracize ruinbound dwarves. Soldorak and Narathun families might embrace a ruinbound child—but they also might reject them out of fear that other clans could use them to paint the entire family as corrupted. In creating a ruinbound character, you need to decide how you were received, reflected by your background. Are you an urchin or an outlander, having made your own way after being rejected by your family? Are you a charlatan or a criminal, forced down a dangerous path by the fears of those around you? Or might you be a noble, treasured by your family despite—or because of—your condition?": "毁坏性矮人是相当罕见的，任何血统的矮人都可以生下来。莫洛尔人仍然不知道该如何看待他们，尽管他们对共生体的态度通常反映了对废墟地带矮人的态度。多尔达伦矮人对任何来到他们土地上的废墟生物充满敌意，并声称废墟生物的孩子从未在他们的部族中出生；虽然这是个可能性，但也有传言说多尔达伦人中的索多拉克特工将这些婴儿送去庆祝他们的部族，以免他们遇到更黑暗的命运。德洛拉纳特和托尔多拉特氏族很好奇，但他们不一定会排斥废墟中的矮人。索尔多拉克和纳拉逊家族可能会接纳一个废墟化的孩子--但他们也可能会拒绝他们，因为他们担心其他家族会利用他们来描绘整个家族的堕落。在创建一个废墟化的角色时，你需要决定你是如何被接受的，由你的背景反映出来。你是一个顽童还是一个外乡人，在被家族拒绝后自己闯出一片天地？你是一个骗子或罪犯，被周围人的恐惧逼上了一条危险的道路？或者你可能是一个贵族，尽管--或者因为--你的状况而被你的家人所珍视？",
	"As a ruinbound dwarf, you could also choose to attribute your class abilities to your symbiont or your unnatural nature. As a sorcerer, your spellcasting could be channeled through your symbiont or other mutations.

If you're a ruinbound warlock, you could say that your symbiont is your patron, an active sentience within you—and if you help it grow, it promises you greater powers.": "作为一个毁灭的矮人，你也可以选择将你的等级能力归于你的共生体或你的非自然天性。作为一个巫师，你的法术可以通过你的共生体或其他变异来引导。任何拥有无甲防御的阶级都可以把它表现为与身体变异相联系；如果你是野蛮人，你的愤怒可以表现为一种主动的转变。如果你是个废墟术士，你可以说你的共生体是你的守护者，是你体内活跃的有生命力的东西--如果你帮助它成长，它就会给你带来更大的力量。",
	"While others might fear them, ruinbound dwarves aren't innately evil. In creating a ruinbound character, talk with your DM about where you'd like your story to go. Do you want to be faced with the threat of corruption? Is it possible that Dyrrn does have plans for you? Or do you want to be a true hero despite your seemingly sinister features?": "虽然其他人可能会害怕他们，但废墟中的矮人并不是天生的邪恶。在创建废墟角色时，与你的管理员讨论你想让你的故事走向哪里。你想面对腐败的威胁吗？Dyrrn有没有可能对你有计划？或者你想成为一个真正的英雄，尽管你看起来很阴险的特点？",

	"Young gnolls grow with uncanny speed. A gnoll is capable of fending for itself after only a few months, and is considered an adult at 5 years of age. Gnolls live to be around 30 years old. They remain vigorous until the end; death by old age is marked by a catastrophic decline over a space of a few days. Many believe this unusual lifecycle is tied to the supernatural origins of the gnoll.": "年轻的地精以不可思议的速度成长。一个地精只需几个月就能自食其力，5岁时就被认为是一个成年人。地精活到30岁左右。他们直到最后都保持着旺盛的生命力；老死的标志是在几天时间内出现灾难性的衰退。许多人认为这种不寻常的生命周期与地精的超自然起源有关。",

	"The most important identifier for a Znir gnoll is its whoop. While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflections that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it's impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names—names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflection of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don't speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan name to a formal introduction: \"Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.\"": "Znir侏儒最重要的识别标志是它的呼声。虽然声音很短，但它包括一系列的超声波转音，表示氏族、个人标识和家庭关系的暗示（兹尼尔人通过母亲追踪血统）。由于大多数非地精不可能正确地复制 \"呜呜 \"声，地精也使用契约名称--旨在与客户和其他外人使用的名称。所有地精使用的契约名称都有一个基本结构；名称的转折表示性别，不过如果不讲地精语，很少有人能认识到这一点。兹尼尔人通常在正式介绍时附上氏族名称。\"Ghyrryn Barrakas，Znir。\"",

	"The Nightmare Shroud is a kalashtar tradition. Rather than physically transforming, nightmare monks generate ectoplasmic projections, manifesting claws of shadow. Blending physical blows with psychic attacks, they strike fear into the mind of their enemies. A kalashtar typically surrounds themselves with the image of their quori spirit, but the shroud can take any shape.": "梦魇裹尸布是卡拉什塔的传统。梦魇僧侣不是身体上的转变，而是产生外质投影，显现出阴影的爪子。他们将物理打击与精神攻击结合起来，在敌人的头脑中制造恐惧。卡拉斯塔人通常用他们的奎里精神的形象围绕着自己，但这个罩子可以有任何形状。",

	"As a Living Weapon monk, you may draw on a singular technique, or you may instead combine different styles. Both the abilities you gain from this subclass and the base abilities of the monk class can reflect your ability to control and alter your physical form. When you use Slow Fall, you might be shifting shape to craft gliding membranes (Traveler's Blade) or catching the air in an ectoplasmic cloak (Nightmare Shroud). Unarmored Defense reflects defensive shapeshifting, and when you develop Ki-Empowered Strikes it reflects an enhancement of your natural weapons.": "作为一个活体武器僧侣，你可以使用一种单一的技术，也可以结合不同的风格。你从这个子类中获得的能力和僧侣类的基本能力都能反映出你控制和改变自己身体形态的能力。当你使用 \"慢速坠落 \"时，你可能会改变形状来制作滑翔膜（旅行者之刃），或者用外质斗篷来捕捉空气（梦魇之罩）。无甲防御反映了防御性的变形，而当你开发出气力打击时，它反映了你的自然武器的增强。",
	"Most of the Living Weapon techniques make use of natural gifts; for example, the Traveler's Blade assumes that you possess the malleable form of a changeling. However, any member of any species can follow these paths. If you don't possess any innate shapeshifting gifts or a bond to a quori spirit, it's up to you and your DM to explain how you manifest these gifts. If you're not a kalashtar, your Nightmare Shroud could be the ghost of an ancestor or lover, clinging to you and helping you fight. If you're not a changeling, perhaps you were altered by the daelkyr or part of a Vadalis supersoldier program—you can't change your face, but you can still grow bone blades and stretch your limbs to strike distant foes.": "大多数活体武器技术都利用了天赋；例如，\"旅行者之刃 \"假定你拥有变种人的可塑性形态。然而，任何物种的任何成员都可以遵循这些路径。如果你不具备任何先天的变身天赋或与夸里精灵的联系，那就由你和你的DM来解释你如何表现这些天赋。如果你不是卡拉什塔人，你的噩梦裹尸布可能是一个祖先或情人的鬼魂，紧紧抓住你并帮助你战斗。如果你不是变种人，也许你被daelkyr改变了，或者是Vadalis超级士兵计划的一部分--你不能改变你的脸，但你仍然可以长出骨刃，伸展你的四肢来打击远处的敌人。",

The effect ends early if the creature has one or more hit points restored, if any creature uses its action to expend one use of a healer's kit, or makes a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check with a DC equal to your ki save DC.": "每回合一次，当你用非武装攻击击中一个生物时，你可以花费1个奇异点来撕裂你的目标，并造成深层流血的伤口。在接下来的每一回合开始时，该生物会受到此效果的{@damage 1d4}点割裂伤害。如果该生物恢复了一个或更多的命中率，如果任何生物使用它的行动来消耗一个治疗包的使用权，或者成功地进行了智慧（医学）检查，其DC等于你的气力保存DC，则该效果提前结束。",

	"{@b The Vigilant Eye.} Cult members develop an alien eye on the palm of their non-dominant hand. When they view the world through this eye, members can see \"secrets\" about the world around them that feel true—such as seeing certain people are possessed by demons or about to commit murder. Members take vigilante action to eliminate the threats \"revealed\" by their eyes. This cult often takes root in House Deneith enclaves or city watch units.": "{@b The Vigilant Eye.} 邪教成员在其非主导的手掌上长出一只异形眼。当他们通过这只眼睛看世界时，成员可以看到他们周围世界的 \"秘密\"，感觉是真实的--比如看到某些人被恶魔附身或即将实施谋杀。成员们采取义警行动，消除他们眼睛 \"揭示 \"的威胁。这种邪教常常在迪尼斯家族的飞地或城市观察单位中扎根。",
	"Corrupted cult": "腐败的邪教",
	"{@b Whisperers.} An ancient tradition found across the Shadow Marches. Whisperers have a strange bond with gibbering mouthers, and a Whisperer family will keep a mouther somewhere in their home. When a family member reaches a certain age, they are fed to the mouther; the Whisperers believe that the soul of the departed lives forever in the mouther and can be heard in the gibbering. The name \"Whisperer\" comes from their tradition of prayer, a sort of ecstatic murmuring that mimics the chaotic gibbering of the mouther.": "{@b Whisperers.} 一个古老的传统，在整个阴影地带被发现。耳语者与胡言乱语的人有一种奇怪的联系，一个耳语者家庭会在家里的某个地方养一只胡言乱语者。当家庭成员到了一定的年龄，他们就会被喂给口吐莲花；耳语者相信，离世者的灵魂永远活在口吐莲花中，并能从口吐莲花中听到。Whisperer \"这个名字来自于他们的祈祷传统，一种模仿mouther的混乱胡言乱语的狂喜喃喃自语。",

	"Transactional cult": "交易型邪教",
	"{@b The Hive.} Members of the Hive believe they are the children of Valaara, the Crawling Queen. Most believe they began their lives as insects, which then crawled into a humanoid body and consumed its brain. Hive cultists are compelled to work together, tirelessly pursuing the goals of their queen.": "{@b The Hive.} 蜂巢的成员相信他们是爬行女王瓦拉拉的孩子。大多数人相信他们的生活是从昆虫开始的，然后爬进人形的身体并吞噬其大脑。蜂巢的崇拜者被迫一起工作，不知疲倦地追求他们女王的目标。",
	"{@b The Inner Sun.} This cult can be found across the west coast of Khorvaire, from the Shadow Marches to the Demon Wastes. Cultists believe that there is a paradise within Khyber: the Vale of the Inner Sun. To earn passage to the Vale, a champion must defeat a host of worthy foes, dedicating their souls to the Gatekeeper. Cults vary on the criteria for \"worthy foe\"—while some cultists are serial killers, others only consider monsters or evildoers as qualifying for their passage.": "{@b The Inner Sun.} 这个邪教在霍尔韦尔的整个西海岸都能找到，从阴影地带到恶魔荒野。教徒们相信，在开伯尔有一个天堂：内太阳谷。为了获得进入谷地的资格，冠军必须击败一大批有价值的敌人，将他们的灵魂献给守门人。邪教对 \"有价值的敌人 \"的标准各不相同--有些邪教徒是连环杀手，有些则只认为怪物或恶人才有资格通过。",

	"{@b The Transcendent Flesh.} Followers of the Transcendent Flesh walk the paths of the Foul Labyrinth in a quest to evolve beyond the bodies they were born in.

Revenants may operate alone, or a band of cultists may believe they are heroes from the same time period. Katashka, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}, and {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn the Corruptor} have all been known to produce revenant cults. The challenge of fighting a revenant cult is simple: How do you know they're not reborn heroes with a vital purpose?": "{@b Revenants.}不要与瓦伦纳的亡灵之刃相混淆，亡灵教的成员相信他们是古代的英雄转世，为神圣的目的服务。复活者可以单独行动，也可以由一帮邪教徒相信他们是同一时期的英雄。卡塔什卡（Katashka）、{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}和{@creature Dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn the Corruptor}都曾产生过复仇者邪教。打击复仇者邪教的挑战很简单。你怎么知道他们不是有重要目的的重生英雄？",
	"Varies": "不尽相同",
	"{@b Loyalists.} A common cult that can spring up anywhere, loyalists worship their immortal patron as a deity and are devoted to releasing it from Khyber. Traditional loyalists may have been slowly advancing their patron's goals for centuries, worming their way into positions of influence and aiding their master's inhuman minions. Corrupted loyalists are usually wildly dedicated to a single task, and the cult will dissolve if their attempt fails.": "{@b Loyalists.}一种常见的邪教，可以在任何地方兴起，忠诚者把他们不朽的守护者当作神灵来崇拜，并致力于把它从开伯尔释放出来。传统的效忠者可能在几个世纪以来一直在缓慢地推进他们守护者的目标，通过蠕动的方式进入有影响力的位置，并帮助他们主人的非人爪牙。腐败的忠诚者通常疯狂地致力于一项任务，如果他们的尝试失败，邪教就会解体。",

	"You're a revenant. You believe that you are the reincarnation of an ancient hero with a destiny to fulfill in the modern age.

	"You're tied to a transactional cult, such as the Court of Shadows. You believe that the good you can do with the powers you possess outweighs the sinister nature of their source.

If you succeed, will you lose those powers (perhaps changing your class or subclass to reflect this)? Are you being pursued by your former allies?": "你作为邪教冠军获得了部分或全部的阶级特征，但现在你正试图找到一种方法来打破这种联系。如果你成功了，你会失去这些力量吗（也许会改变你的等级或子类来反映这一点）？你是否正在被你以前的盟友追捕？",

	"You're a member of a traditional cult, and you believe that the power you serve will make the world a better place. If you're bound to Rak Tulkhesh, you may believe that conflict is the natural state of life; if you're tied to Sul Khatesh, you could feel that a world ruled by magic would be a better place.

These beliefs won't stop you from being a hero, they simply affect the path you take to heroic action.

	"{@b Aasimar Bloodline.} Typically, aasimar nature isn't hereditary... but in your case, it is. Where did your lineage begin? How large is your family? Are you closely tied to the church and celebrated for your gifts? Or was your family cast out long ago, branded as heretics and apostates?": "{@b Aasimar Bloodline.}通常，阿西玛人的天性是不会遗传的......但在你的情况下，它是。你的血统从哪里开始？你的家族有多大？你是否与教会有密切联系，并因你的天赋而受到赞誉？还是你的家族很久以前就被驱逐出去，被打成异端和叛教者？",
	"{@b Noble Birth.} While your line manifests an aasimar only once in a generation or so, your family is well known for its piety and virtue. Other members of your family might be clerics or paladins, and your family estate could be in a manifest zone tied to Daanvi, Irian, or Syrania. Are you a proud heir of your family, or do you chafe at its noble traditions? ": "{@b Noble Birth.}虽然你的家族在一代左右的时间里才会出现一个阿西玛人，但你的家族却以其虔诚和美德而闻名。你的家族其他成员可能是牧师或圣骑士，而你的家族产业可能位于与达安维、伊里安或锡拉尼亚相连的显灵区。你是一个骄傲的家族继承人，还是对其高贵的传统感到不满？",

	"{@b Experiment.} Your gifts weren't given freely; they were seized through arcane science. Perhaps House Vadalis is trying to produce divine souls. Maybe you've been fused to a Khyber shard that contains the essence of a trapped celestial. Did you volunteer for these experiments, or are you a victim? Do you work with your celestial guide, or do you consider it to be your servant?": "{@b Experiment.}你的天赋不是自由给予的；它们是通过神秘的科学夺取的。也许瓦达里斯家族正试图制造神圣的灵魂。也许你已经被融合到一个包含了被困天人精华的凯博尔碎片上。你是自愿参加这些实验的，还是你是受害者？你是与你的天体向导合作，还是认为它是你的仆人？",
