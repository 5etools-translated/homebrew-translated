	"Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons & Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world—which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.": "Wizards of the Coast在2002年宣布了 \"幻想设定搜索\"：为《龙与地下城》征集一个新的世界。他们收到了数以千计的作品，包括我的世界--它最终成为了Eberron。我与James Wyatt、Bill Slavicsek、Christopher Perkins以及其他许多人合作，将我最初的想法发展成了今天你们所知道的Eberron。",
	"I'm extremely proud of the world we've created. However, there are elements I love that I've never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations—considering the civilizations that the merfolk, sahuagin, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down—or in some cases, cut entirely—in our original {@i Eberron Campaign Setting.} The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn't nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.": "我对我们所创造的世界感到非常自豪。然而，有一些我喜欢的元素，我从来没有机会在正式书籍中探索。在最初设计这个世界时，我把水生国家包括在内--考虑到merfolk、sahuagin和其他智能海底物种可能建立的文明。我们为Eberron开发了一个独特的平面系统，与成熟的大轮盘有着截然不同的风味。我们提出了一个自豪的地精帝国的想法，它在人类到来之前就已经统治了Khorvaire。但是任何资料书的页数都是有限的，这些想法不得不被削减--或者在某些情况下，完全被削减--在我们的原始资料中（%0%）。 这些星球是存在的，但是从来没有足够的空间来描述它们，每个星球超过一段，这还不足以理解费尔尼亚与火元素星球的不同之处，或者你如何在马巴尔设置一个冒险。从正统材料中，我们知道萨瓦金人的存在，并且在斯托姆雷奇有大使，但对他们的文明没有任何透露。",
	"From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a {@i Planes of Eberron} sourcebook, but it never came to pass—and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn't have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I've always had dreams of Droaam and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the {@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron's history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}—the official fifth-edition hardcover—the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn't enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.": "从一开始，我就希望我们能看到一本{@i Planes of Eberron}的资料书，但它从未实现--当Eberron在D&D第四和第五版中回归时，资料书需要优先考虑设定的关键基础，而没有空间去探索这些隐藏的角落。因此，虽然我脑子里一直有Droaam和平面的梦想，但Eberron是海岸奇才的知识产权，只有他们能出版新的Eberron材料。这一切在2018年发生了变化，当时海岸奇才与我合作创作了{@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}，这是一本在地下城主协会网站上发布的PDF补充材料......随着这次发布，他们在Eberron的历史上第一次让任何人通过地下城主协会为Eberron创造新内容成为可能。第二年，在创建{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}--官方的第五版精装本时，设计团队扩展了莫洛矮人的故事。但是再一次，没有足够的空间来关注他们与达尔凯尔的冲突和地下世界的神秘。",
	"That's where Wayne Chang, who works with me on the podcast {@i Manifest Zone}, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I've always wanted to explore—the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations—as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!": "这就是与我一起做播客（%0%）的韦恩-张进入画面的地方。我们一起为这本书制定了一个计划，深入探讨了许多我一直想探讨的话题--飞机、达卡尼和海底国家--以及一些更近期的发展，如Moror。于是，这本书就诞生了。",
	"As it turns out, writing a book of this size is a {@i tremendous} amount of work. Laura Hirsbrunner accomplished herculean tasks as both editor and layout designer, while Will Brolley developed immersive monsters, magic items, archetypes, and more. Since working in a vacuum is a good way to die of asphyxiation, I'm incredibly grateful to Laura, Wayne, and Will for being a constant source of feedback and inspiration.": "事实证明，写一本这么大的书是一个（%0%）的工作量。劳拉-赫斯布鲁纳作为编辑和版面设计师完成了艰巨的任务，而威尔-布罗利则开发了令人沉浸的怪物、魔法物品、原型等等。由于在真空中工作是窒息而死的好方法，我非常感谢劳拉、韦恩和威尔，他们一直是我的反馈和灵感的来源。",
	"We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova's wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens chapter 3, to Marco Bernardini's amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it's been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life. In some instances, to convey a concept to an artist, I put my own limited artistic skills to work. Below is my first draft of a sahuagin city built around one of the slumbering kar'lassa—and in chapter 4, you can see how Vincentius Matthew made sense of my sketch!": "我们还与许多艺术家合作，为这本书开发原创艺术。从卡捷琳娜-波利亚科娃（Katerina Poliakova）为蒂拉-米隆（Tira Miron）所作的精彩画像（该画为第三章的开篇），到马可-贝纳迪尼（Marco Bernardini）令人惊叹的平面图，以及每个平面的微型视图，看到世界的这些未被探索的方面变成现实，令人激动。在某些情况下，为了向艺术家传达一个概念，我把自己有限的艺术技能用于工作。下面是我对一个围绕沉睡的卡拉萨建造的萨瓦金城市的初稿--在第四章中，你可以看到文森提斯-马修是如何理解我的草图的。",
	"I'd be remiss if I didn't also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive—including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis—who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.": "如果我不把Eberron的玩家、管理人和创作者群体也叫出来，那就太失职了，他们都在保持Eberron的活力--包括我们优秀的游戏测试者！当然，还有我聪明的妻子、创作伙伴和Twogether工作室的联合创始人Jennifer Ellis--她总是愿意和我谈论卧底鲨鱼人或和平星球的旅游景点。当然，还有我聪明的妻子、创作伙伴和Twogether工作室的联合创始人Jennifer Ellis--她总是愿意和我聊一聊卧底鲨鱼人或和平位面的旅游景点。",
	"Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You'll find a few details that don't align with previous sourcebooks; it's up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there's always a third option: using {@i your} answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now—when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death—we wanted Eberron to {@i inspire} players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon—and some, you might even ignore. This presents {@i my} Eberron, but I'm always thrilled to see people making the world their own.": "在我把这本书放在你面前之前，有一个免责声明：这是我在我的桌子上运行Eberron的愿景。你会发现一些与以前的资料书不一致的细节；这取决于你决定使用哪些。但请记住，总是有第三个选择：使用（%0%）的答案。从一开始，至今已近二十年了--当我们选择不介绍哀伤的原因或揭示死亡印记的力量时，我们就希望Eberron能够（%1%）玩家和地下城主，而不是限制他们。这是一本供你借鉴的书--有些你甚至可以忽略不计。这本书介绍了{@i my}Eberron，但我总是很高兴看到人们把这个世界变成自己的世界。",
	"And now—Eberron awaits!": "而现在--Eberron在等待着!",
	"\"You think it's safe?\" The crackling arcs of energy wreathing the elemental engine cast a pale blue light across the platform. Dela smiled back at him. \"It's perfectly safe, Rev. Haven't you been on a lightning rail before? What you see there is just a secondary manifestation—\"": "\"你认为这很安全吗？\" 环绕着元素引擎的噼里啪啦的能量弧线在平台上投下淡淡的蓝光。德拉回头对他笑了笑。\"这是完全安全的，牧师，你以前没坐过闪电轨道吗？你在那里看到的只是一个次要的表现--\"",
	"\"Not that.\" The warforged soldier's voice was deep and solemn, like a heavy drum. \"This task. The mountains. The island. The journey into dreams. Rusty says it's impossible.\"": "\"不是这样的。\" 战神士兵的声音低沉而庄重，像一面沉重的鼓。\"这个任务。这座山。这座岛。进入梦境的旅程。拉斯蒂说这是不可能的。\"",
	"\"Just because something's never been done doesn't mean it's impossible. It just means it's a problem I've never tried to solve. But safe? No, it's definitely not safe.\" She reached up, resting her hand on his steel shoulder. \"That's why I'm bringing you.\"": "\"某件事情从未被做过并不意味着它不可能。它只是意味着这是一个我从未试图解决的问题。但是安全吗？不，这绝对不安全。\" 她伸手，把她的手搁在他的钢肩上。\"这就是为什么我把你带来。\"",

	"Eberron is a world shaped by the rise and fall of great ancient civilizations. It's a setting scarred by the impact of the Last War and defined by the ongoing evolution of magic and artifice. What were the weapons of the Last War? How is magic a part of everyday life in the Five Nations? What events of the distant past could play a role in the present day?": "Eberron是一个由伟大的古代文明的兴衰塑造的世界。它是一个被最后一次战争的影响弄得伤痕累累的环境，并被不断进化的魔法和人工制品所定义。最后一次战争的武器是什么？魔法是如何成为五国日常生活的一部分的？遥远的过去有哪些事件会对今天产生影响？",
	"The present is shaped by the past. The shadow of the Last War hangs over Khorvaire, setting the stage for conflicts ahead. But Khorvaire also bears the marks of struggles far more ancient. The goblins in Sharn's slums are descended from the founders of a mighty empire, and they rightfully feel that humanity stole their homeland. The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters. The Church of the Silver Flame was founded at the end of the third century, but it's simply the latest manifestation of a conflict that began at the dawn of time—a battle still fought in the shadows by the fiendish Lords of Dust and the dragons of the Chamber.": "现在是由过去塑造的。最后一次战争的阴影笼罩着霍尔韦尔，为未来的冲突埋下伏笔。但霍尔韦尔也有更古老的斗争的痕迹。沙恩贫民区的地精是一个强大帝国的创始人的后代，他们有理由认为人类偷走了他们的家园。九世纪初对狼人的清洗使人类和变异者之间的关系变得紧张。银色火焰教会成立于第三世纪末，但它只是一场始于时间之初的冲突的最新表现，这场战斗仍然由邪恶的尘埃领主和商会的龙在阴影中进行。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} touches briefly on Eberron's history, but a detailed accounting of the world's hundred-thousand-year recorded history could easily fill an entire book.

	"Before history began, legend holds...": "在历史开始之前，传说中...",
	"The three Progenitor dragons created the planes.": "三条始祖龙创造了这些平面。",
	"In a cosmic quarrel, Khyber destroyed Siberys. Eberron then bound Khyber within her own body, forming the world.": "在一次宇宙争吵中，凯贝尔摧毁了西伯利亚。艾伯伦随后将凯伯捆绑在自己的身体里，形成了这个世界。",
	"No one knows what came before the world's creation. In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation—that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.": "没有人知道在这个世界被创造之前发生了什么。在一些说法中，Xoriat曾经包含了所有的东西；一些 \"下龙 \"的崇拜者断言，daelkyr只是在试图恢复现实的原始平衡。其他人则认为，在创造之前什么都没有--始祖是从更高层次的现实中降生的，也就是位于多鲁尔之上和之外的那个不可知的领域。但几乎所有的文化都同意将现实带入的力量。",
	"Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world.": "三个生命将各个平面编织起来，然后用这些概念作为物质世界的基础。巨人断言这三个生命是某种形式的泰坦，但常见的解释是祖巫的解释：三个巨大的宇宙龙。不管怎么说，这个故事以冲突结束。在完成物质界的创造后，凯伯毫无征兆地出手，将西伯利亚斯撕碎，留下他的残余物在西伯利亚斯的金环中漂流到世界各地。",
	"Knowing she couldn't defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below.": "Eberron知道自己无法战胜Khyber，便将她盘绕起来，成为世界本身，并将Khyber束缚在一个活生生的监狱中，一直保持到今天。因此，我们所知道的世界是由西伯利亚、艾伯伦和凯博尔的交集构成的：上面的龙，中间的龙，下面的龙。",
	"While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don't worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she's the source of all life, but doesn't actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.": "虽然这个故事家喻户晓，但有些传统赋予它更多的意义。在五族中，大多数人认为它是对天空、大地和潜伏在下面的怪物的简单比喻。即使那些认为它是字面意义上的真理的人（如许多德鲁伊），也不会像崇拜主宰者那样崇拜祖先。西伯丽丝已经死了，而Eberron是世界本身；她是所有生命的源头，但并不以任何方式积极干预。然而，少数邪教（特别是在霍尔韦尔的哥布林中）确实直接崇拜始祖。",
	"Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there {@i is} a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest.": "无论是字面上的真相还是隐喻，这些强大的祖先之战都发生在遥远的过去。它对现在的影响最重要的是：有（%0%）个现在。由于这一创造行为带来了万物的存在，霍尔韦尔的学者们还没有找到任何关于这个时间之前的遗迹或记录。如果一个故事涉及到一个来自更深的过去的物体，它很可能拥有巨大的力量，并具有巨大的学术兴趣。",
	"During the Age of Demons, myths tell us...": "在恶魔的时代，神话告诉我们...",

	"Champions, later known as the Sovereign Hosts, fought the overlords with an alliance of dragons and couatl.": "冠军们，后来被称为 \"主宰者\"，与龙和库拉特的联盟一起与霸主作战。",
	"The sacrifice of the couatl bound the overlords with a force that formed the silver Flame.": "库阿特尔的牺牲用一种形成银色火焰的力量束缚了霸主们。",
	"According to the Progenitor myth, Eberron became the world and all natural creatures are her children. But in the first days of the world, the children of Khyber—fiends, aberrations, and other monsters—rose up from the darkness and claimed dominion over the world. The greatest among these were the overlords, immortal archfiends embodying the evils that plague mortals. Each overlord shaped the world to match their whims, and no civilization could challenge them. It was a time of chaos that lasted for untold millennia.": "根据始祖神话，Eberron成为了世界，所有自然生物都是她的孩子。但在世界诞生的最初几天，开伯尔的孩子们--恶魔、畸形人和其他怪物--从黑暗中崛起，并要求统治这个世界。其中最伟大的是霸主，不朽的大恶魔，体现了困扰凡人的邪恶。每个霸主都按照自己的想法来塑造世界，没有任何文明可以挑战他们。那是一个持续了数千年的混乱时期。",
	"The Age of Demons came to an end after an extended war between the overlords and a legendary group of champions—now known as the Sovereign Host. Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods—or perhaps something else entirely—these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn't be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords. Even today, the overlords remain bound and the world protected from immense evil by this force, now known as the Silver Flame.": "恶魔时代在霸主和一群传奇的冠军--现在被称为 \"主宰者\"--之间的长期战争后结束了。这些叛乱者被一些人认为是龙，被另一些人认为是神，或者可能是其他完全不同的东西，他们组建了一支龙的军队，与couatl结盟，据说是体现了Siberys最后的光芒的本地天人。由于不朽的霸主无法被摧毁，无数的库亚特人牺牲了自己，他们的精神结合成一个纯粹的天体能量的监狱，可以约束霸主。即使在今天，这些霸主仍然被束缚着，世界也被这股力量保护着，免遭巨大的邪恶，现在被称为银色火焰。",
	"The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It's commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons—for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It's up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.": "恶魔时代在十万年前结束，远远早于今天任何文明的建立。但这个时代在神话中挥之不去，并继续影响着现代生活。人们普遍认为，主宰的神灵在这一时期行走于世界，并与霸主进行了肉搏战。然而，许多学者断言，这些神话实际上是基于英雄的龙的事迹--例如，主权者奥里昂的神话可能是受一条名叫奥里隆斯特里克斯的龙的事迹启发。真相由DM决定，但冒险者有可能找到与这个时代的主权者有关的地方或遗物。你可能会找到多尔-阿拉赫在与守门人卡塔什卡战斗时使用的长矛，或者她和多尔-多恩为嘲笑者的背叛而剥皮的地方。无论与神还是龙有关，这些遗址和遗迹仍然拥有力量。",
	"While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison... and there's no official list of all of the overlords or where they are bound. So if a story calls for a region where the restless dead rise and prey on the living, this could be the prison of Katashka the Gatekeeper. If a region is suddenly overcome by ice and snow, perhaps the shard-prison of Dral Khatuur has been brought there.": "虽然霸主们可能已经被打败，但他们无法被摧毁。每个霸主都被束缚在开伯尔龙石中，被银色火焰的力量关在监狱里。虽然被束缚，但霸主可以影响其监狱周围地区的世界......而且没有所有霸主的官方名单，也没有他们被束缚的地方。因此，如果一个故事要求一个地区的不安分的死人复活并捕食活人，这可能是守门人卡塔什卡的监狱。如果一个地区突然被冰雪覆盖，也许德拉-卡图尔的碎片监狱就被带到了那里。",
	"Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. As they reach higher levels, adventurers might even become active participants in this struggle instead of mere pawns. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.": "每位霸主只有在 \"龙族预言 \"的某个特定段落实现后才能被释放。被称为 \"尘埃领主 \"的恶魔们致力于发现和实施这些预言，而商会的龙则试图阻止他们。双方都经常利用凡人作为棋子，所以冒险者很容易发现自己被卷入了这些计划。当他们达到更高的水平时，冒险者甚至可能成为这场斗争的积极参与者，而不是单纯的棋子。虽然很少有凡人意识到这一点，但这是一场决定世界命运的持续冷战。",
	"Dungeons from the Age of Demons are rare, few surviving the passage of time. Any remaining sites would be infused with fiendish or celestial power. A vault created by the couatl could hold a deadly artifact tied to an overlord. An obsidian fortress might be imbued with Rak Tulkhesh's power, and people who settle there are consumed by homicidal rage. One of the best documented sites is Ashtakala, an ancient city in the heart of the Demon Wastes said to be the sanctuary of the Lords of Dust.": "恶魔时代的地下城是罕见的，很少有人能在时间的流逝中幸存下来。任何剩余的地点都会被注入恶魔或天体的力量。由库阿特尔创造的金库可能存放着与一个霸主有关的致命的神器。一个黑曜石堡垒可能被注入了拉克-图尔克什的力量，在那里定居的人被杀人的愤怒所吞噬。有记载的最佳地点之一是阿什塔卡拉，这是位于恶魔荒原中心的一座古城，据说是尘土领主的圣地。",

	"In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen'drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons' increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber's power (see chapter 3), the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.": "在恶魔时代之后，龙是Eberron中最强大的力量。一些龙帮助指导较小的生物，包括Xen'drik的巨人，使其掌握奥术。随着龙的统治力不断增强，开伯尔之女的力量激增（见第3章），龙被迫撤退到阿贡尼森的隔离区。他们至今仍留在那里，希望能阻止她的力量进一步增强。",
	"Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen'drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it's thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul'sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it's not known whether the Cul'sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.": "Xen'drik上出现了多个巨人国家。苏拉特联盟擅长元素束缚和魔法培育。他们创造了乌鸦作为活的武器来对付叛乱的精灵，人们认为火巨人是苏拉特的残余。十一国集团是一个由11个城邦组成的联盟，每个城邦都由一个强大的帝王法师领导。他们多样化的文化重视内部和外部的竞争，认为这推动了进化。Cul's Dominion由强大的帝王法师统治，试图主宰所有的现实。他们探索平面和世界；不知道Cul'sir是否攻击了Dal Quor，也不知道当时的Quori是否试图入侵Eberron，但这两个势力打了一场持久战。巨人用灾难性的魔法摧毁了埃伯龙的一颗卫星，破坏了达尔-库尔和世界之间的平面联系，从而结束了这场冲突。从那时起，科里人就无法亲自前往艾伯伦，也不再有任何通往达尔-库尔的显露区。",
	"These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul'sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the elves—both those oppressed by the Cul'sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul'sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen'drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler's Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du'rashka Tul—\"the madness of crowds\"—causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.": "这些行动对巨人文明产生了破坏性的影响。在这场动乱中，许多Cul's sir的臣民利用这个机会进行反抗，但最大的起义是精灵--既包括那些被Cul's sir压迫的精灵，也包括那些从未被巨人征服过的精灵战士。当Cul's sir威胁要再次动用他们最危险的魔法来摧毁精灵时，龙从Argonnessen强势崛起了。他们彻底摧毁了Xen'drik的文明，包括巨人和其他文明，然后对这片土地下了现代人无法理解的诅咒。时至今日，这片土地上的祸害阻止了任何先进文明的再次崛起。旅行者的诅咒扭曲了空间，使Xen'drik的旅行变得不可靠。被称为Du'rashka Tul的诅咒--\"人群的疯狂\"--导致过于先进或广泛的文明崩塌，陷入疯狂。德拉康诅咒被认为是巨人从强大的泰坦演变为山丘巨人和今天已知的其他巨人的原因。这些龙卷风诅咒的全部范围尚不清楚，但其影响是明确无误的。",
	"The curses laid on Xen'drik mean that the entire continent is in essence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped or explored. The giants mastered secrets of arcane magic as yet unmatched by humanity or even by the elves, and as such Xen'drik is a source for powerful artifacts, spells, and eldritch machines. Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to recover a Cul'sir artifact could easily drive an adventure, and Sulat weapons could shift the balance of power in Khorvaire if they fell into the wrong hands.": "对Xen'drik的诅咒意味着整个大陆在本质上是一个巨大的地牢，一个永远无法被完全映射或探索的土地。巨人掌握了人类甚至精灵都无法比拟的奥术秘密，因此Xen'drik是强大的神器、法术和超自然机器的来源。元素飞艇和战争锻造者的发展都是受到与古代巨人有关的发现的启发，而新的发现也可能同样重要。寻找库尔先生神器的竞赛很容易推动一场冒险，而苏拉特武器如果落入坏人之手，就会改变霍尔韦尔的权力平衡。",
	"While Xen'drik's many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn't stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach lies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to be explored.": "虽然Xen'drik的许多诅咒使人们几乎不可能在这片土地上殖民，但这并不妨碍人们的尝试！Stormreach城是一个位于未知边缘的前哨站。暴风城是未知世界边缘的前哨，是强大的神器、未知的魔法和奇异的生物流向霍尔韦尔的门户。在Stormreach之外，是一个充满废墟和奇迹的耐人寻味的大陆，等待人们去探索。",
	"Though the Age of Giants has faded into legend, consider these ideas how your character might encounter its echoes today:": "虽然巨人时代已经消逝在传说中，但考虑这些想法，你的角色今天可能会遇到它的回声。",
	"As an elf, you're haunted by trance-visions of an ancient city of your distant ancestors hidden somewhere in trackless Xen'drik. What is the force that's calling you there?": "作为一个精灵，你被恍惚的幻象所困扰，你遥远的祖先的古城隐藏在无轨的Xen'drik的某个地方。是什么力量在召唤你去那里？",
	"As an artificer, you're on the edge of an arcane breakthrough, but the final piece of the puzzle is tied to the work of the giants. You'll need to search through their ruins for clues.": "作为一名工匠，你正处在一个奥秘突破的边缘，但拼图的最后一块与巨人的工作有关。你需要在他们的废墟中寻找线索。",
	"You possess a trinket from Xen'drik—a prospector's map? an ancient key?—tied to an ancient Sulat vault.": "你拥有一个来自Xen'drik的饰品--一个探矿者的地图？ 一把古老的钥匙？--系在一个古老的Sulat金库上。",

	"Goblins and orcs dominated Khorvaire, while dwarves, dragonborn, gnomes, and halflings had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.": "地精和兽人主宰着霍尔韦尔，而矮人、龙裔、地精和半身人在大陆上的存在和影响较小。",
	"The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan flourished for ten thousand years, then was destroyed when the daelkyr invaded the Material Plane. Thought he daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.": "达卡安的妖精帝国繁荣了一万年，然后在达尔基尔人入侵物质世界时被摧毁。以为达尔基尔被打败了，但他们的疯狂种子摧毁了地精文明。",
	"The daelkyr conflict destroyed the dwarven Realm Below.": "daelkyr冲突摧毁了下面的矮人境界。",
	"After Xen'drik was shattered by the dragons, they remained isolated in Argonnessen. Human civilization was slowly taking shape on Sarlona, but the most dynamic cultures of this period were forming on and around the continent of Khorvaire. The elves founded a new homeland on Aerenal—\"Aeren's rest\" in Elvish—instituting the Undying Court and establishing the cultures that would become the Aereni and the Tairnadal. On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire. The Dhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes—the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with the dragonborn of what's now Q'barra, the dwarves of the Realm Below, and Tairnadal explorers, but none could stop the advance of Dhakaan.": "在Xen'drik被龙击碎后，他们仍然被隔离在Argonnessen。人类文明在萨洛纳慢慢形成，但这一时期最有活力的文化是在霍尔韦尔大陆及其周围形成的。精灵们在艾瑞纳（Aerenal）--埃尔维什语中的 \"艾瑞纳的休息\"--建立了不朽的法庭，并建立了后来成为艾瑞纳和泰尔纳达尔的文化。在霍尔韦尔，地精族崛起，在大约16000年前建立了达卡安帝国。在接下来的一万年里，它扩张到统治了整个霍尔韦尔中部。达卡尼人慢慢地把他们所有的竞争者都赶到了边缘地带--山区、荒野、大路。他们与现在Q'barra的龙裔、下层世界的矮人和Tairnadal探险家发生冲突，但没有人能够阻止达卡尼的前进。",
	"However, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations through portals from Xoriat, the Empire of Dhakaan was shattered—along with the Realm Below, the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves (see chapter 4).": "然而，当戴尔基尔（daelkyr）率领反常者的军队通过Xoriat的传送门时，达卡安帝国被粉碎了--同时被粉碎的还有地下世界，即矮人的巨大地下文明（见第四章）。",
	"Though this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani champions and Gatekeeper druids sealed the daelkyr in Khyber, the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to creating monsters such as dolgaunts and doppelgangers, the daelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness. One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids' shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization (see chapter 4). Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of Khorvaire were ruins and chaos.": "虽然这场激烈的冲突在达卡尼冠军和守门人德鲁伊将戴尔克尔封印在开伯尔时结束了，但造成的伤害是无法弥补的。除了创造出多尔衮和二重身等怪物外，达尔凯尔还释放出更多微妙的诅咒和疯狂的菌种。其中之一侵蚀了与地精族的共同梦想的联系，而这个梦想将达卡尼文明团结在一起（见第4章）。在几代人的时间里，这个古老的帝国崩溃了，陷入了内战。邪教和残忍在地精族中蔓延，很快，霍尔韦尔的表面只剩下了废墟和混乱。",
	"Dhakaani ruins are scattered across Khorvaire. Most major cities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations, and there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have been largely ignored by the human inhabitants. A Dhakaani ruin could be viewed as a simple dungeon, but these are the remnants of a proud civilization; what an adventurer sees merely as a useful magical weapon could be an important cultural relic of the goblins. While the Empire wasn't as advanced as the civilizations of giants that came before, the daashor artificers of Dhakaan—discussed in depth in chapter 4—produced remarkable artifacts and were master weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of adamantine and other exotic alloys.": "达卡尼废墟散布在霍尔韦尔。现代的大多数主要城市都建立在达卡尼人的基础上，在他们下面有一些隧道和战壕，但基本上被人类居民忽视了。达卡尼人的废墟可以被看作是一个简单的地牢，但这些都是一个骄傲的文明的遗迹；一个冒险家仅仅看作是有用的魔法武器的东西，可能是地精的重要文化遗物。虽然帝国并不像之前的巨人文明那样先进，但达卡安的daashor工匠--在第四章中深入讨论过--生产出了非凡的工艺品，并且是对金刚砂和其他异域合金有着卓越理解的武器制造大师。",
	"This is the story that underlies both the rise of Darguun and the recent emergence of the Heirs of Dhakaan. Before the arrival of humanity, goblins and orcs shaped the destiny of the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim that ancient glory.": "这就是达尔古恩的崛起和最近达卡安继承人的出现所依据的故事。在人类到来之前，地精和兽人塑造了这片大陆的命运，有许多人渴望重新获得那份古老的荣耀。",
	"Though it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the daelkyr incursion is still felt across Khorvaire. The cults of the Dragon Below and the Gatekeeper druids are active legacies of this conflict. As described in chapter 4, the Mror dwarves are venturing into the ruined Realm Below and recovering daelkyr symbionts and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed—and scheming—in Khyber, adventurers could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.": "虽然它发生在几千年前，但整个霍尔韦尔仍能感受到戴尔基尔入侵的影响。下面的龙的崇拜和守门人德鲁伊是这场冲突的积极遗留物。正如第四章所描述的，摩尔矮人正在冒险进入破败的下层世界，并恢复了daelkyr共生体和其他遗物。当达尔凯尔人仍然被封印在开伯尔，并且在谋划着什么的时候，冒险者们可能会偶然发现古代的防御工事、有机的达尔凯尔金库，或者这场被遗忘的战争的其他遗迹。",
	"Whether your character is a goblinoid, orc, or a more recent inhabitant of these lands, consider these ways the Age of Monsters might inform your past and your future:": "无论你的角色是哥布林人、兽人，还是这些土地上的新近居民，都要考虑怪物时代可能会影响你的过去和未来的方式。",
	"As a character from the Shadow Marches, you carry an heirloom amulet you've sworn to keep safe. Have you learned that it's part of the wards that bind the daelkyr in Khyber—and that cultists bound to a particular daelkyr will be hunting you, trying to destroy the amulet?": "作为一个来自阴影地带的角色，你带着一个你发誓要保护的传家宝护身符。你是否了解到这是束缚开伯尔的守护神的一部分--被某一特定守护神束缚的邪教徒将追杀你，试图摧毁这枚护身符？",
	"You're obsessed with the early history of Khorvaire and are always searching for leads on ancient Dhakaani ruins and daelkyr relics. Are you a city goblin or Tharashk half-orc searching for your roots? Or just a scholar of another race that's fascinated with the period?": "你对霍尔韦尔的早期历史非常着迷，总是在寻找关于古代达卡尼遗迹和戴尔基尔遗物的线索。你是一个城市地精或塔拉什克半兽人，正在寻找你的根源？或者只是一个对这个时期着迷的其他种族的学者？",
	"As a Dhakaani goblinoid (see chapter 4) you are an advance scout for a Dhakaani {@i kech}. Were you sent to reclaim lost Dhakaani artifacts, or are you studying the people of the surface, identifying weaknesses, and considering if any are worthy allies?": "作为一个达卡尼妖精（见第四章），你是达卡尼人（%0%）的先遣侦察员。你是被派去夺回丢失的达卡尼文物，还是在研究地表的人们，找出他们的弱点，并考虑是否有值得信赖的盟友？",
	"You possess a Dhakaani weapon, claimed by your ancestor and handed down through your family. There is power in the blade, but it only flows through a bearer when they prove worthy... and you haven't. Can you master the blade?

	"Scholars at Morgrave University call the last five thousand years the Age of Humanity, contending that its defining trait is the rise of human civilization and its spread from Sarlona to Khorvaire. The gnome sages of the Library of Korranberg call it the Dragonmarked Age, asserting that the appearance of the dragonmarks and the achievements of the dragonmarked houses are more significant in the grand sweep of history than mere human achievements. Most people dodge this debate by simply referring to it as the modern age.": "莫格雷夫大学的学者们将过去的五千年称为人类时代，认为它的决定性特征是人类文明的崛起及其从萨尔罗纳到科尔维尔的传播。科兰伯格图书馆的地精贤者称其为龙纹时代，断言龙纹的出现和龙纹家族的成就在历史的长河中比单纯的人类成就更为重要。大多数人通过简单地将其称为现代时代来回避这场辩论。",

	"The first aberrant dragonmarks appeared soon after the true dragonmarks. At the time the dragonmarked houses joined together as the Twelve, aberrant marks were spread across the Five Nations. Some members of the Twelve truly saw aberrant marks as abominations; others considered them a convenient scapegoat to unite the houses and strengthen their position. House propaganda and whispering campaigns amplified the perception of aberrant marks as dangerous and uncontrollable. Fear progressed to violence, and in time, to squads of Deneith soldiers, Vadalis trackers, and Medani inquisitors \"protecting communities from the aberrant threat.\"": "第一批反常的龙纹在真正的龙纹之后不久出现。在有龙纹的家族联合起来成为十二家族的时候，反常的龙纹已经遍布五国。十二家族的一些成员真的把异常龙纹视为可憎的东西；其他人则认为它们是一个方便的替罪羊，可以团结各家族并加强其地位。家族的宣传和窃窃私语活动扩大了人们对反常印记的看法，认为它们是危险和不可控制的。恐惧发展为暴力，并在一段时间内发展为由迪尼斯士兵、瓦达利斯追踪者和梅达尼审问者组成的小队，\"保护社区免受反常者的威胁\"。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks of the time were generally more powerful and dangerous than those of today. The Twelve took true stories of innocents harmed by uncontrolled marks and amplified them—superstition and fear did the rest. The title \"War of the Mark\" implies two even sides, but this was more of a purge than a struggle of equals. Toward the end, however, a few aberrant-marked champions rallied others and challenged the houses. The most infamous were Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague, who seized Sharn and declared it a haven for those with aberrant marks. Eventually, the forces of the Twelve laid siege to the city. When Tarkanan and the Lady saw victory was impossible, they unleashed the full power of their marks. Tarkanan's mark gave him power over the earth, and he shattered the towers. The Lady of the Plague called vermin up from the depths and spread vile diseases in the ruins. Both the aberrants sheltering in the city and the armies attacking it perished, and Sharn remained in ruins for centuries before Galifar I finally reclaimed it.": "当时的反常龙印通常比今天的龙印更加强大和危险。十二人组采用了被不受控制的龙印伤害的无辜者的真实故事，并将其放大--其余的都是迷信和恐惧。印记战争 \"的标题意味着双方势均力敌，但这更像是一场清洗，而不是一场平等的斗争。然而，到了最后，一些拥有反常印记的冠军召集了其他人，向各家族发起挑战。最臭名昭著的是哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）和瘟疫女士，他们占领了沙恩，并宣布它是那些拥有反常标记的人的避难所。最终，十二门派的军队围攻了这座城市。当塔卡南和夫人看到胜利是不可能的，他们释放了他们印记的全部力量。塔卡南的印记给了他对大地的力量，他击碎了塔楼。瘟疫女士将害虫从深处召唤出来，在废墟中传播卑鄙的疾病。躲在城市里的异教徒和攻击它的军队都死了，在加利法尔一世最终夺回它之前，沙恩在废墟中停留了几个世纪。",
	"Aberrant marks were almost completely eradicated during the War of the Mark. When they reappeared in later centuries, they were far weaker than Halas Tarkanan's earth-shaking power, but fear and prejudice linger. Over the last century, with no explanation, aberrant marks have begun manifesting with greater frequency and power. The criminal organization known as House Tarkanan has begun organizing and training those with aberrant marks, fearing another purge could lie ahead.": "在印记战争期间，异端印记几乎被完全根除。当它们在后来的几个世纪中重新出现时，它们远远弱于哈拉斯-塔卡南撼动地球的力量，但恐惧和偏见仍然存在。在过去的一个世纪里，在没有任何解释的情况下，反常的印记开始以更高的频率和力量显现出来。被称为塔卡南家族的犯罪组织已经开始组织和训练那些拥有反常印记的人，担心另一场清洗可能就在眼前。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks don't seem to deserve the prejudice leveled against them. They aren't that powerful, and player characters rarely lose control of their marks. But everyone knows that Halas Tarkanan shattered the towers of Sharn, the Lady of the Plague destroyed her village as a child, and the Dreambreaker was a monster who drove people mad as amusement. As a character with an aberrant mark, you bear the burden of centuries of superstition, stories encouraged and exaggerated by the Twelve. And the leaders of House Tarkanan point to the War of the Mark as a possible path the future might take. If you have an aberrant mark, will you join House Tarkanan and prepare to fight the Twelve? Or will you try to change public perception and fight the fears?": "异教徒的龙印似乎并不值得对它们的偏见。它们并不那么强大，而且玩家角色很少会失去对其标记的控制。但是每个人都知道哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）击碎了沙恩的塔楼，瘟疫女士在孩童时期就摧毁了她的村庄，而破梦者是一个把人逼疯的怪物，作为娱乐。作为一个拥有反常印记的角色，你背负着几个世纪以来的迷信，这些故事被十二门徒鼓励和夸大了。而塔卡南家族的领导人则指出，印记战争是未来可能采取的道路。如果你有一个反常的标记，你会加入塔卡南家族并准备与十二门徒作战吗？或者你会尝试改变公众的看法，与恐惧作斗争？",
	"Karrn the Conqueror failed to unite Khorvaire by force, but centuries later, his descendant Galifar Wynarn succeeded through might and clever diplomacy. Galifar didn't just want power—he wanted to build a better world, and on many levels, he succeeded. He abolished slavery and instituted laws that promised justice for all. Over time, the kingdom would promote public education and the rise of the merchant class. It can be argued that Galifar stumbled in giving the dragonmarked houses too much economic power; while the Korth Edicts prevent dragonmarked heirs from holding lands or titles, they also lay the foundation for the near-monopolies the houses hold today.": "征服者卡恩没能用武力统一霍尔韦尔，但几个世纪后，他的后裔加利法尔-维纳恩通过力量和聪明的外交手段获得了成功。加利法尔不仅仅想要权力，他还想建立一个更好的世界，在很多方面他都成功了。他废除了奴隶制，并制定了法律，承诺为所有人提供公正。随着时间的推移，这个王国将促进公共教育和商人阶层的崛起。可以说，加利法尔在给予龙纹家族太多的经济权力方面是失策的；虽然科思法令阻止了龙纹家族的继承人持有土地或头衔，但它们也为龙纹家族今天的近乎垄断奠定了基础。",
	"Galifar can also be faulted for his precarious system of succession. By this tradition, the children of the reigning monarch served as governors of the five provinces, with the eldest governing Cyre. The previous governors served as regents until an heir came of age, at which point they were expected to step aside. This system led to multiple rebellions and attempted secessions over the course of history, the Last War simply the largest and last of them.": "加利法尔也因其不稳定的继承制度而受到指责。根据这一传统，在位君主的子女担任五个省的总督，其中最年长的人负责管理赛尔。前任总督担任摄政者，直到继承人成年，这时他们就应该靠边站。这种制度在历史上导致了多次叛乱和分裂企图，最后一次战争只是其中最大和最后的一次。",
	"A century of brutal war has divided the people of the Five Nations, but they are still united by a host of common laws and customs—the legacy of Galifar. And there are still many who look back to Galifar as a golden age, who would be willing to go to war again for a chance to return to that supposed paradise.": "一个世纪的残酷战争分裂了五国人民，但他们仍然被一系列共同的法律和习俗所团结--加利法尔的遗产。仍有许多人将加利法尔视为黄金时代，他们愿意再次参战，以获得回到那个所谓的天堂的机会。",
	"Many of the institutions that define the nations—the Arcane Congress, the King's Citadel, Rekkenmark Academy—were originally dedicated to the common good of Galifar. Members of the longer-lived races, such as elves and dwarves, likely trained at these institutions, regardless of the nations they serve today.": "许多定义国家的机构--奥术大会、国王城堡、雷肯马克学院--最初都是为了加利法尔的共同利益。寿命较长的种族的成员，如精灵和矮人，很可能在这些机构中接受过训练，无论他们今天服务于哪个国家。",
	"Before the ninth century, lycanthropy was largely just a fearsome legend. Lycanthropes were known in the wilds of Khorvaire, but few people had ever seen one; most commoners thought lycanthropes and shifters were the same thing. Early in the ninth century, something changed—the curse of lycanthropy became more virulent, and its victims were driven to ever more extreme behavior. Werewolf attacks and wererat infestations became an increasing problem in western Aundair, and by 830 YK, some feared that an apocalyptic threat was brewing in the Towering Wood—that any day a horde of lycanthropes could sweep across the land and destroy all civilization.": "在第九世纪之前，狼人症基本上只是一个可怕的传说。狼人在Khorvaire的荒野中是众所周知的，但很少有人见过；大多数平民认为狼人和变身者是一回事。在第九世纪初，一些事情发生了变化--狼人的诅咒变得更加剧烈，它的受害者被驱赶到更加极端的行为。狼人的攻击和狼人的侵扰在昂代尔西部成为一个日益严重的问题，到公元830年，一些人担心在高耸的森林中正在酝酿一个世界末日的威胁--任何一天，狼人的部落都可能横扫这片土地并摧毁所有文明。",
	"In 832 YK, Keeper of the Flame Jolan Sol declared that lycanthropy corrupted the soul itself and must be completely eliminated. An army of templars was dispatched to Aundair, and servants of the Flame across Khorvaire were ordered to be vigilant and root out lycanthropes in hiding. And so they did.": "在公元832年，火焰守护者乔兰-索尔宣布，狼人症会腐蚀灵魂本身，必须彻底消除。一支圣殿骑士的军队被派往昂代尔，火焰的仆人们被命令在整个霍尔韦尔保持警惕，铲除隐藏的狼人。他们就这样做了。",
	"The Silver Crusade lasted for nearly fifty years. The first two decades were a brutal, bloody campaign. The lycanthropes were massing in great numbers on the edge of the Towering Wood (now part of the Eldeen Reaches), driven by some unknown evil; most sages believe it was an overlord on the verge of breaking its bonds. The templars were outmatched. The lycanthropes were cunning and could quickly replenish their numbers, and they intentionally stirred up conflict between templars and shifters. But after decades of bitter conflict, the tide slowly turned in favor of the templars. And somehow, the power of the curse was broken. Lycanthropy continued, but its effects weren't as strong, its victims not so driven to darkness.": "白银十字军持续了近五十年。前20年是一场残酷、血腥的运动。狼人在塔林的边缘（现在是Eldeen Reaches的一部分）大量集结，被一些未知的邪恶所驱使；大多数圣人认为那是一个即将打破束缚的霸主。圣殿骑士们不敌对手。狼人很狡猾，可以迅速补充他们的数量，他们故意挑起圣殿骑士和变身者之间的冲突。但经过几十年的激烈冲突，潮流慢慢转向对圣殿骑士有利。而且不知何故，诅咒的力量被打破了。狼人症继续存在，但它的影响没有那么强烈，它的受害者也没有那么被驱赶到黑暗中。",
	"While the true threat was dealt with, the peasants of Aundair had suffered through decades of terror and sought a greater revenge. The next thirty years saw an ongoing inquisition as zealous converts to the faith—later classified as an extremist sect, the Pure Flame—sought to hunt down every remaining lycanthrope. In the process, many innocents—including a great many shifters—were tortured and slain. So the Silver Crusade began as a selfless act that may well have saved Galifar, but ended up as an outlet for paranoia and hatred.": "虽然真正的威胁被解决了，但昂代尔的农民们经历了几十年的恐怖，并寻求更大的报复。在接下来的30年里，由于狂热的信仰皈依者--后来被归类为极端主义教派 \"纯正火焰\"--试图追捕所有剩余的狼人。在这个过程中，许多无辜的人--包括许多移居者--被折磨和杀戮。因此，银色十字军开始时是一种无私的行为，很可能拯救了加里法尔，但最后却成为一种偏执和仇恨的发泄。",
	"The Silver Crusade is a classic example of a virtuous act with bloody consequences. It highlights that the goals of the Silver Flame are to protect the innocent, but fear, greed, and anger can lead reasonable people astray. It's the origin of the Pure Flame, an extremist sect whose narrow vision of the Flame is as a ruthless weapon with which to burn evildoers. It has created a deep rift between shifters and followers of the Silver Flame, and hurt the reputation of shifters everywhere.": "银色十字军是一个典型的例子，说明了一个具有血腥后果的美德行为。它强调了银色火焰的目标是保护无辜者，但恐惧、贪婪和愤怒会使有理智的人误入歧途。这是 \"纯洁之火 \"的起源，这是一个极端主义教派，他们对 \"纯洁之火 \"的狭隘看法是将其作为一种无情的武器来烧死恶人。它在移居者和银色火焰的追随者之间造成了深刻的裂痕，并伤害了各地移居者的声誉。",
	"In the wake of the Silver Crusade, lycanthropy is considered to be a serious public health risk. Templars deal with any confirmed lycanthropes—when possible, they seek to apprehend and cure them, but lethal force is always an option. Lycanthropes can find a safe haven in Droaam (especially with the Dark Pack), and there are still a few scattered ‘thropes in Stormreach, Q'barra, Darguun, and other frontier nations.": "在白银十字军东征之后，狼人症被认为是一种严重的公共健康风险。圣殿骑士处理任何确认的狼人，在可能的情况下，他们寻求逮捕并治愈他们，但致命的武力总是一种选择。狼人可以在Droaam找到一个安全的避难所（特别是与黑暗族群一起），在Stormreach、Q'barra、Darguun和其他边境国家仍有一些零星的狼人。",
	"If you're playing a follower of the Silver Flame or a shifter, think about your view of the Silver Crusade. Likewise, if you're from Aundair or the Eldeen Reaches, consider if your family suffered during the lycanthropic terror.": "如果你扮演的是银色火焰的追随者或变身者，请考虑一下你对银色十字军的看法。同样地，如果你来自Aundair或Eldeen Reaches，请考虑你的家庭是否在狼人的恐怖中遭受了伤害。",

In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows—the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future.

	"The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King's Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together—the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the {@item everbright lantern|ERLW}, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece—a city of wonders—this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.": "加利法尔各省在很大程度上保留了它们曾经的国家的文化和传统。在许多方面，他们的差异得到了加强和颂扬。每个国家都有一个联合王国的支柱：昂代尔的奥术大会、布雷兰的国王城堡、卡尔纳特的雷肯马克学院、瑟兰的大神庙。赛尔是个例外。赛尔没有建立在梅特罗尔现有的文化上，而是从整个加利法尔吸引了专家和工匠。赛尔不是任何一个学科的中心，而是所有这些东西聚集在一起的枢纽--加利法尔可能是最好的。当奥术大会完善了{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}的时候，梅特罗尔是第一个街道被它们照亮的城市。士兵们在Rekkenmark训练，但最优秀的战士在Vermishard卫队服役。虽然梅特罗尔是展示品--一个充满奇迹的城市，但这一原则被应用于整个赛尔中部。通过教育、艺术、甚至农业，赛尔城展示了加利法尔能够完成的最好的东西。",
	"This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever.

	"Cyre's artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith's greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It's said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There's no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create,\" but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.": "赛尔的艺术气质（有人会说是异想天开）被坎尼斯家族的存在所平衡和维持，坎尼斯家族的总部设在伟大的制造之城。许多Cannith家族最伟大的锻造厂遍布赛尔城，为支持赛尔城的奇迹提供了一个实用的工业基础。而这些奇迹有很多形式。昂代尔的奥术大会专注于魔法的实际应用，而赛尔的维纳恩学院则探索奥术的艺术潜力。梅特罗尔是一座充满光明和奇迹的城市。游客可以与过去的英雄和国王的幻象对话，或者观看历史时刻的重演。据说，在梅特罗尔没有人挨饿，也没有人感受到冬天的叮咬。赛尔人说，这反映了赛尔人的慷慨和无私的精神；批评者指出，这些社会项目之所以能够实现，是因为其他省份的人民缴纳了税收。当然，赛尔掌握着加利法尔的财富，其生活水平高于其他任何省份。这是颓废吗？还是它是一个正在进行的工作，一个有朝一日可以应用于所有国家的模式？我们无从得知。居里人哀悼失去的东西；其他国家的人民批评居里人的生活方式是寄生的。\"我们的梦想是什么，我们的手就创造什么。\"但痛苦的局外人指出，虽然居里人的手可能已经建造，但他们使用的是别人辛勤工作收集的资源。",
	"This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar's traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch's children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.": "加利法尔的继承传统进一步助长了这种怨恨。以加利法尔一世为例，君主的子女担任五个省的总督。最年长的人管理赛尔，在君主去世后，他们将继承王位，他们的子女将接管各省的管理职位。之前的总督将作为摄政者，直到孩子们成年，之后则作为顾问。当一个君主没有五个孩子时，以前的总督将保留这些职位。但这个原则很简单。赛尔是加利法尔的心脏，其他一切都将围绕它进行。",
	"Galifar's goal with Cyre was to create something new, a culture combining the best aspects of the other nations. In the newly forged Thrane, Aundair, and Breland, the people kept their old traditions, and ruling families were often incorporated into the new governing structure; similarly, Galifar preserved the customs of his homeland of Karrnath. But in the old kingdom of Metrol—which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland—the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre's dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.": "加利法尔与赛尔的目标是创造新的东西，一种结合了其他国家的最佳方面的文化。在新成立的瑟兰（Thrane）、昂代尔（Aundair）和布雷兰（Breland），人们保留了他们的旧传统，统治家族往往被纳入新的管理结构中；同样，加利法尔也保留了他的家乡卡尔纳特（Karrnath）的习俗。但在旧的梅特罗尔王国--它的面积和形状大致相当于现代的哀牢地--旧的制度和统治者被推到一边，为赛尔的梦想腾出空间。梅特罗尔的一些贵族家庭接受了这条新路。其他人则被加利法尔重新安置，被授予对以前作为独立边界存在的地区的权力。",

There were ongoing clashes with goblins, a few severe, but the Ghaal'dar goblinoid clans largely remained in the mountains and dark places until the Last War.": "覆盖了现在的Darguun。在加里法尔建立时，它基本上没有得到解决，一直是王国阴影下的一个落后地区。它的人民最终繁荣起来，并以他们作为锡兰人的身份为荣，模仿中央王国的习俗。然而，他们几乎没有投资于北方的财富或随之而来的奇迹。与哥布林的冲突不断，有几次很严重，但Ghaal'dar的哥布林氏族基本上都留在了山区和黑暗的地方，直到最后一次战争。",
	"—now Valenar—was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar's greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it's because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called \"thrones\"), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime.": "-现在的瓦伦纳（Valenar）实际上是一个独立的国家，有着截然不同的文化和价值观。这可以说是加利法尔最失败的地方。该地区最初是由来自萨尔罗纳西部的库南地区的移民定居的。加利法尔一世想要旧梅特罗尔的土地，所以他把东赛尔的权力交给了其贵族，让他们成为库南定居者的封建领主。刀锋沙漠是物理和文化上的分界线，在授予贵族们土地后，加利法尔基本上没有理会他们。因此，贵族家庭坚持梅特罗尔的旧传统，而不是接受赛尔的新文化。许多人小气而骄傲，对这种安排不满意，并残忍地把气撒在他们的库南臣民身上。有些人想知道为什么精灵们夺取瓦伦纳的控制权如此简单；首先是因为库南人对他们的赛尔统治者（一般称为 \"王位\"）没有爱，许多人觉得他们在新政权下其实过得更好。",

Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre—expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with House Orien to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.": "在雅罗特国王的统治下，赛尔城继续发光发热。有抱负的艺术家和年轻的贵族们纷纷来到王国的中心，而最有前途的工匠们则在制造之城定居。贾罗特国王对赛尔城给予了极大的关注--扩大了弗米沙德宫，与奥瑞恩家族合作扩大了赛尔城的闪电轨道，并在威纳恩艺术学院和圣主大教堂上花费了数十万加里法。",
	"Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre's finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a paladin, Karrnath is a fighter, Aundair is a wizard, and Breland is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard—elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.": "贾罗特死后，加利法尔王国向战争螺旋式上升。起初，赛伦人的士气很高。米珊女王背后有几个世纪的传统。每个人都知道赛尔拥有最好的东西：最好的巫师，最好的士兵，最重要的工匠。从某种程度上说，这是真的，但当与卡尔纳特或瑟兰的武术文化相比，一支由杰出士兵组成的部队意义不大。赛尔最优秀的巫师是艺术家和理论学者，而昂代尔则长期致力于将魔法作为战争的工具。而专家级的工匠们在很大程度上与坎尼斯家族联系在一起，后者在战争中保持中立。如果把各国视为角色，瑟兰是圣骑士，卡尔纳特是战士，昂代尔是巫师，布雷兰德是流氓。在这个党派中，赛尔是酒吧--优雅、聪明，什么都会做一点......但在与他人合作时最好，不准备单独对抗强大的敌人。",
	"Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar's treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be—and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King's Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre's new military academy. But it was clear that the Cyran dream had been sustained by many hands, and now the nation had to learn to stand on its own.": "赛尔适应了；它必须这样做。起初，它严重依赖雇佣兵，因为它是加利法尔的国库所在地，有多余的黄金。但随着时间的推移和冲突范围的明确，赛尔人投身于战争。赛尔缺乏卡尔纳特或瑟兰的尚武精神，但它的人民因绝对相信他们是正确的而得到支持。除此之外，在人们的眼中，赛尔就是加利法尔。它体现了王国的理想，它可能成为的最好的东西--而这是值得为之奋斗的东西。尽管如此，这场斗争对赛尔人的心理造成了巨大的打击。几个世纪以来，赛尔人一直将自己视为表演的明星，受到所有人的爱戴；现在所有的人都在反对他们，至少有些人可以将他们以前的信仰视为傲慢和自恋。赛尔确实拥有最好的东西，但这是因为它是免费提供的。现在，奥术大会将其知识纯粹用于Aundair的利益，Rekkenmark只训练Karrns，而国王的城堡则为Breland服务。是的，赛尔有所有这些东西的回声。它的巫师仍然是除昂代尔之外的任何国家的对手，而弗米沙德卫队构成了赛尔新军事学院的核心。但很明显，赛尔的梦想是由许多人支持的，现在这个国家必须学会自立。",
	"For a millennium since its founding, Cyran culture blended the traditions of other nations. However, the Last War built walls between Cyre and the other nations, and each evolved in this century of relative isolation. Cyrans know the old add-a-verse songs beloved by Aundairians, but few know the {@i Epic of Valiant and Vigilant}, a tale of martial bravery close to the heart of every modern Aundairian. Nor do they know the maxims of Beggar Dane that now serve as a cornerstone of Brelish culture.": "在建国后的一千年里，赛尔文化融合了其他国家的传统。然而，最后的战争在赛尔和其他国家之间筑起了围墙，在这个相对孤立的世纪里，每个国家都在不断发展。赛尔人知道昂代尔人所喜爱的古老的加词歌曲，但很少有人知道{@i Epic of Valiant and Vigilant}，这是一个与每个现代昂代尔人心心相印的武勇故事。他们也不知道乞丐丹恩的格言，这些格言现在是布莱里什文化的一个基石。",
	"Even so, Cyrans see their culture as being founded on the best principles of Galifar, and can still find some common ground with people of any nation. A Cyran can play Conqueror with a Karrn, sing an add-a-verse song with an Aundairian, and debate religion with a Thrane. This reflects the founding principles of Cyre—to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there's no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there's always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera—a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it's a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they're constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation—that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better. But the Cyrans themselves assert that this approach is rooted in love, not arrogance, and call it the \"Cyran appreciation.\"": "即便如此，赛伦人认为他们的文化是建立在加利法尔的最佳原则之上的，并且仍然可以与任何国家的人找到一些共同点。赛尔人可以和卡恩人一起玩征服者游戏，和昂代尔人一起唱一首加冕歌曲，和瑟兰人一起辩论宗教。这反映了赛尔的创始原则--收集加利法尔最好的方面并在此基础上发展。赛尔人相信没有一条完美的道路；多样性是力量的源泉，但总是有改进的空间。因此，Cyran文化是一个奇怪的混合体--来自整个Khorvaire的熟悉元素与稳定、持续的进化相结合。西兰音乐家可能会用瑟兰人的虔诚风格演奏卡尔纳提人的葬礼哀歌；这是一个拼图，其中的碎片是已知的，但它们不断以新的方式被排列。其他国家的一些公民认为这是盗用--锡兰人是腐肉爬行者，他们偷窃别人的东西，却傲慢地认为自己能做得更好。但居里人自己断言，这种做法是源于爱，而不是傲慢，并称其为 \"居里人的欣赏\"。",
	"In playing a Cyran, you can find familiar things anywhere you go. But what do you treasure in your memories of Cyre? Do you cling to the past, or do you embrace the Cyran principle of always striving to find a new and better way?": "在扮演赛尔号的过程中，你走到哪里都能找到熟悉的东西。但在你对赛尔的记忆中，你珍惜什么呢？你是紧紧抓住过去，还是接受赛尔号的原则，一直努力寻找一种新的更好的方式？",
	"Cyran fashion blends practicality with endless diversity. Cyran clothing begins with a simple foundation—this base layer may be colorful, but it's first and foremost practical and durable. Whether breeches, skirts, shirts, or gowns, a Cyran starts with whatever the wearer finds most comfortable. Again, this base level is well made, but it's more functional than decorative.": "Cyran时尚融合了实用性和无尽的多样性。Cyran服装从一个简单的基础开始--这个基础层可能是彩色的，但它首先是实用和耐用的。无论是马裤、裙子、衬衫还是长袍，Cyran人从佩戴者认为最舒适的东西开始。同样，这个基础层做得很好，但它的功能性大于装饰性。",
	"After starting with simplicity, the Cyran adds flair. Cloaks and gloves are both integral parts of Cyran fashion. Gloves can be short and sturdy for work or war, or long and decorative for more formal occasions. Cloaks likewise vary between the practical and decorative: a heavy cloak for traveling, a short cape for casual socializing, and a long, light cloak with a {@item glamerweave|ERLW} lining for an evening at the Grand Stage. In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion. Often made from copper, leather, wood, or glass, Cyran jewelry is not a display of wealth, but rather a way to express individuality. Feathers and bells are also common accessories; there is a Cyran dance that involves belled bracelets and anklets. Finally, masks are often worn at formal or festive occasions. Cyran masks aren't intended to conceal identity or intent; rather, they are a way of enhancing identity and expressing a mood.": "从简单开始后，Cyran人增加了炫耀。斗篷和手套都是赛兰人时装的组成部分。手套可以是用于工作或战争的短而结实的，也可以是用于更正式场合的长而装饰性的。斗篷也同样在实用性和装饰性之间变化：厚重的斗篷用于旅行，短斗篷用于休闲社交，而长而轻的斗篷带有{@item glamerweave|ERLW}衬里，用于大舞台的夜晚。除了手套、靴子和斗篷等服装外，珠宝和其他配件也是锡兰时尚的重要组成部分。通常由铜、皮革、木头或玻璃制成，居里安人的珠宝不是财富的展示，而是表达个性的一种方式。羽毛和铃铛也是常见的配饰；有一种居里安人的舞蹈涉及到带铃铛的手链和脚链。最后，面具经常在正式或节日的场合佩戴。居里安人的面具并不是为了掩盖身份或意图；相反，它们是增强身份和表达心情的一种方式。",
	"Traditionally, Cyran fashion is filled with color (often accentuated with {@item glamerweave|ERLW}). In the wake of the Last War, many Cyrans have adopted Mourningwear—clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black. Others celebrate their nation by preserving its styles. Because of the emphasis on durability, your Cyran character may still have the clothes they were wearing on the Day of Mourning. What was that outfit, and do you still wear it? Do you favor a mask, and if so, what is its design?": "传统上，居里夫人的时装充满了色彩（通常用（%0%）来强调）。在最后一次战争之后，许多锡兰人采用了丧服--按锡兰风格剪裁的衣服，但完全是黑色的。其他人则通过保留其风格来庆祝他们的国家。由于强调耐用性，你的赛伦人角色可能还保留着他们在哀悼日所穿的衣服。那件衣服是什么，你还穿吗？你是否偏爱面具，如果是的话，它的设计是什么？",
	"Cyran cuisine reflects the Cyran principles of working with the best of all traditions while continuing to explore. In many ways, this is similar to the Sharn fusion found in the City of Towers, and a number of Cyran refugees are rising stars in Sharn's culinary scene. Cyrans blend the thrakel spices of Thrane with traditional Karrn stews, and add the heat of southern Breland to the delicate pastries of Aundair. While many refugees cling to family recipes as a way to remember the fallen nation, others continue the tradition of Cyran appreciation—adopting new favorites from the place they've found shelter and looking for ways to improve them.": "西兰美食反映了西兰的原则，即在继续探索的同时，与所有传统中的精华合作。在许多方面，这类似于在塔城发现的沙恩融合，一些赛兰难民是沙恩烹饪界的新星。西兰人将瑟兰的香料与传统的卡恩炖菜相融合，并将南部布雷兰的热度加入到昂代尔的精致糕点中。许多难民坚持使用家族食谱，以此来缅怀逝去的国家，而其他难民则继续保持着欣赏锡兰人的传统--从他们找到庇护所的地方采用新的最爱，并寻找改进它们的方法。",
	"Traditionally, Cyrans viewed arcane magic as an art form as well as a practical tool. This lent itself to a wider study of illusion and enchantment than found in other nations. But it's also about the presentation of magic, regardless of its school. Whether magewright, bard, or wizard, Cyrans often put more show into the performance of magic than even the Aundairians. For a wizard who's studied at the Wynarn Institute, somatic components are almost a dance, while verbal components have the cadence of song or poetry. This echoes the Cyran love of flowing capes and cloaks. As a Cyran spellcaster, you are truly a student of arcane arts; consider how your casting reflects this.": "传统上，锡兰人将神秘的魔法视为一种艺术形式以及一种实用工具。这使其对幻觉和魔法的研究比其他国家更广泛。但这也是关于魔法的展示，无论其流派如何。无论是魔法师、吟游诗人还是巫师，锡兰人在表演魔法时往往比昂代尔人更注重表演。对于一个在维纳恩学院学习过的巫师来说，身体的部分几乎是一种舞蹈，而语言的部分则有歌曲或诗歌的韵律。这与锡兰人对飘逸的披风和斗篷的喜爱相呼应。作为一个居里夫人的施法者，你是真正的奥术学生；考虑你的施法如何反映这一点。",
	"The Silver Flame had some devoted followers and temples in central Cyre, though the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith. However, religion is driven by faith and tradition, and Cyrans have always been encouraged to question and search for new paths. Outer Cyre is a different story. The nobles of Eastern Cyre were and are devout Vassals, convinced they have a divine right to leadership. The people of Southern Cyre are less arrogant, but most hold to a quiet, steadfast faith in the Sovereigns.": "银色火焰在赛尔中部有一些忠实的追随者和庙宇，尽管主权主神是主导性的信仰。然而，宗教是由信仰和传统驱动的，赛尔人一直被鼓励去质疑和寻找新的道路。外赛尔是一个不同的故事。东赛尔的贵族过去和现在都是虔诚的Vassals，坚信他们有神圣的领导权。南部赛尔的人民没有那么傲慢，但大多数人对君主抱有安静、坚定的信仰。",
	"The war drove some Cyrans to embrace their faith more tightly, but for others it was another source of doubt. Likewise, the Mourning threw many devout Cyrans into a crisis of faith, while for others, it actually strengthened it. A devout follower of the Silver Flame doesn't question the cause of the Mourning, they simply seek to protect the innocent from harm. Vassals of the Sovereign Host trust that there is a purpose to their suffering. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Mourning, some Cyrans have turned to the Blood of Vol or cults of the Dragon Below, cursing the gods they once worshiped or following a darker vision. There are also a number of new strains of the old faiths, Cyran twists on the Flame and the Host that seek to adapt traditions to make sense of the war and the world.": "战争促使一些居里人更紧密地拥抱他们的信仰，但对其他人来说，它是另一个怀疑的来源。同样地，哀悼使许多虔诚的赛伦人陷入了信仰危机，而对其他人来说，它实际上加强了信仰。银色火焰的虔诚追随者并不质疑哀悼的原因，他们只是寻求保护无辜者免受伤害。主宰者的附庸相信他们的痛苦是有目的的。同时，在哀悼之后，一些赛兰人转向沃尔之血或龙下的邪教，诅咒他们曾经崇拜的神灵或追随更黑暗的愿景。也有一些旧信仰的新变种，赛兰人对火焰和主人的扭曲，试图调整传统以了解战争和世界的意义。",
	"In playing a Cyran, whether a divine caster or other religious character, consider the impact the Mourning had on your faith. Are you conflicted and struggling to hold to your beliefs? Or was the Mourning a source of inspiration—you know you have a divine purpose, that your people need you? If you're tied to an existing faith, do you follow the standard traditions or have you found an unusual path?": "在扮演Cyran时，无论是神圣的施法者还是其他宗教角色，都要考虑哀悼对你的信仰产生的影响。你是在矛盾中挣扎着坚持自己的信仰？或者说，丧礼是灵感的来源--你知道你有一个神圣的目的，你的人民需要你？如果你与现有的信仰相联系，你是遵循标准的传统，还是找到了一条不寻常的道路？",
	"When most people say \"Cyre,\" they're thinking of central Cyre. When they speak of Cyran refugees, they are referring to the people who fled the Mourning. But there were Cyran refugees long before the end of the war. The Tairnadal elves established the eastern kingdom of Valenar in 956 YK, while Lhesh Haruuc claimed Southern Cyre as Darguun in 969 YK. While Valenar was an unpleasant surprise, it had relatively little impact on the nation. Eastern Cyre had always been isolated, and the Khunan majority embraced elf rule; the refugees were thus a handful of nobles who were painfully out of touch with the traditions of the central kingdom. The loss of Darguun was a more significant blow; Southern Cyre was a backwater, but this was still close to home, and it resulted in a flood of refugees that the war-torn nation was ill-prepared to handle. In creating a Cyran character, consider which Cyre you're from.": "当大多数人说 \"赛尔 \"时，他们想到的是赛尔中部。当他们说到Cyran难民时，他们指的是逃离哀牢的人。但早在战争结束前就有赛尔族难民了。泰尔纳达尔精灵在956 YK年建立了东部的瓦勒纳王国，而Lhesh Haruuc在969 YK年宣称南赛尔为达尔古恩。虽然瓦勒纳是一个令人不快的惊喜，但它对国家的影响相对较小。东赛尔一直与世隔绝，库南人多数接受精灵统治；因此难民是少数贵族，他们与中央王国的传统痛苦地脱节。达尔古恩的丢失是一个更重大的打击；南赛尔是一个落后的地方，但这仍然离家很近，它导致了难民的涌入，这个饱受战争蹂躏的国家没有做好准备来处理。在创建Cyran角色时，要考虑你来自哪个Cyre。",
	"If you're from central Cyre, odds are good that you think of your home as the \"true\" Cyre. Before the Mourning, did you give much thought to the refugees of Valenar and Darguun? Even now, do you think of them when you think of your homeland? Are you devoted to the idea of rebuilding your nation and clinging to your memories and traditions? Or following the Cyran appreciation, are you instead looking forward and trying to find a new and better path, even if that means abandoning the dreams of Cyre?": "如果你来自赛尔中部，你很有可能认为你的家是 \"真正的 \"赛尔。在哀悼之前，你是否考虑过瓦勒纳和达尔古恩的难民？即使是现在，当你想到你的祖国时，你会想到他们吗？你是否致力于重建你的国家，并紧紧抓住你的记忆和传统？还是遵循赛伦的赞赏，你反而向前看，试图找到一条新的、更好的道路，即使这意味着放弃赛尔的梦想？",
	"As an Eastern Cyran, you're tied to a noble family with roots in old Metrol, before Galifar even existed. You don't accept any of the nonsense about Cyre being \"the best of Galifar\" or challenging tradition; if people had stuck to the old ways, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Your people were devoted to the Sovereign Host and truly believed that Aureon had chosen you to rule. At the same time, your lands have been lost for over forty years, and the people of central Cyre have never avenged you or shown your family the respect you deserve. You're not as affected by the Mourning as some, because it wasn't your Cyre that was destroyed—now the others just get to see how you feel. While your character has noble ancestry, you're unlikely to choose the noble background, as nobody would care about such claims. Do you despise the Valenar and hope to reclaim your long-lost homeland? Or do you want to rally Cyran survivors around the {@i true} royal bloodlines, challenging Oargev and reestablishing the long-forgotten kingdom of Metrol?": "作为东锡兰人，你与一个贵族家庭联系在一起，根植于古老的梅托尔，甚至在加利法尔存在之前。你不接受任何关于赛尔是 \"加利法尔最好的 \"或挑战传统的废话；如果人们坚持旧有的方式，也许这一切都可以避免了。你们的人民忠于主宰者，真正相信奥里昂选择了你们来统治。同时，你的土地已经失去了四十多年，赛尔中部的人们从未为你报过仇，也没有对你的家人表示应有的尊重。你不像有些人那样受到哀悼的影响，因为被摧毁的不是你的赛尔城--现在其他人只是看到了你的感受。虽然你的角色有贵族血统，但你不太可能选择贵族背景，因为没有人会关心这种说法。你是否鄙视瓦伦纳人并希望夺回你失散多年的家园？或者你想把Cyran的幸存者团结在{@i true}王室血统周围，挑战Oargev，重建被遗忘已久的Metrol王国？",
	"Your people have been struggling for decades in Southern Cyre, eking out a life in camps and shelters. You were encouraged to take up military service—it was easier to send you to the front than to find a new home for you.

Were you an optimistic idealist? Or were you bitter and angry at the nation that failed to protect you? Are you loyal to Cyre, or are you solely concerned with Darguun and taking vengeance on the goblins?": "你们的人民在南赛尔挣扎了几十年，在难民营和收容所里勉强度日。你们被鼓励去服兵役--把你们送到前线比给你们找一个新家更容易。你的许多朋友和家人都选择崇拜丹妮尔女王和赛尔中央，认为她有远见，会重建加利法尔，恢复一个奇迹的时代。你有这种感觉吗？你是一个乐观的理想主义者吗？还是你对这个未能保护你的国家感到痛苦和愤怒？你是忠于赛尔，还是只关心达尔古恩和向妖精们复仇？",

What forces can be found patrolling the borders? And what were some of the major innovations of the Last War?": "一眼望去，霍尔韦尔会显得很有中世纪特色。士兵们手持长矛和剑，瑟兰因其弓箭手而闻名。但魔法是五国生活的核心部分，用于通信、运输、娱乐......以及战争。上一次战争的战场上使用了哪些武器？哪些部队可以在边境上巡逻？最后一次战争的一些主要创新是什么？",
	"To clarify what lies ahead: This section does not present a system for running mass combats. Rather, it explores the tools and tactics used in the Last War so that adventures can incorporate those elements into the story. This allows for an adventure in which the heroes have to make their way through a field of {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}, or must seize a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} to halt bombardment. But this section doesn't include a system detailing artillery spotting and the accuracy of sustained bombardment. It explores the tools of the Last War with the intent that they could appear in traditional adventures.": "为了澄清前面的内容。本节并没有提出一个进行大规模战斗的系统。相反，它探讨了最后战争中使用的工具和战术，以便冒险可以将这些元素纳入故事中。这允许冒险中的英雄们必须穿过（%0%）的领域，或者必须夺取一个（%1%）来阻止轰炸。但这一节并不包括详细介绍炮兵发现的系统和持续轰炸的准确性。它探讨了最后战争的工具，目的是让它们可以出现在传统的冒险中。",
	"Wands, staffs, and rods are well-established weapons in the world of Eberron. Similarly, arcane artillery doesn't employ any sort of physical projectile, relying solely on magical energy—but rather than a small weapon one person can easily carry, arcane artillery refers to a variety of larger arcane foci that can increase the range and area of magical attacks. Likewise, the war employed magical explosives such as {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} that could wreak devastation by triggering a previously stored spell.": "魔杖、法杖和棒子是Eberron世界中公认的武器。同样，奥术火炮也不采用任何种类的物理弹丸，完全依靠魔法能量--但奥术火炮不是一个人可以轻易携带的小武器，而是指各种较大的奥术焦点，可以增加魔法攻击的范围和面积。同样，战争中采用了魔法炸药，如{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}，可以通过触发先前储存的法术而造成破坏。",
	"As a general rule, the everyday magic of the Five Nations encompasses spell effects of up to 3rd level; while 4th- and 5th-level effects exist, they are rare and remarkable. This means that effects like {@spell wall of force} could be seen on the battlefield, but were exceptional and rarely deployed, while blasts of fire and lightning were more common.": "一般来说，五国的日常魔法包含了3级以下的法术效果；虽然4级和5级的效果也存在，但它们是罕见的、了不起的。这意味着像（%0%）这样的效果可以在战场上看到，但属于例外，很少部署，而火焰和闪电的爆炸则比较常见。",
	"While a specially trained spellcaster must operate arcane artillery, more than one person can assist with its operation, allowing a team to prime, aim, and fire in a single round.": "虽然必须由受过专门训练的施法者来操作奥术火炮，但不止一个人可以协助其操作，允许一个团队在一个回合内进行填料、瞄准和射击。",
	"All attack rolls and saving throws are based on the spellcasting ability of the operator firing the weapon. When arcane artillery is used to target someone at long range, any attack roll has disadvantage and any saving throw against the spell effect has advantage.": "所有的攻击卷和蓄力都是基于发射武器的操作员的法术能力。当奥术火炮被用来瞄准远距离的人时，任何攻击卷都是劣势，任何针对法术效果的蓄力都是优势。",
	"Using these weapons requires specialized training, similar to that of an artificer or magewright; someone trained to operate arcane artillery is generally called a bombardier. A typical bombardier may use the magewright stat block, but they also know one or more spells that they're only able to cast using a focus—such as a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} or {@object long rod|ExploringEberron}. So an Aundairian specialist might be able to produce {@spell cloudkill} through a focus, but not cast the spell on its own. Bombardiers don't use spell slots when casting these spells; instead, they prime the weapon using a dragonshard solution known as the {@i breath of Siberys}.": "使用这些武器需要专门的训练，类似于工匠或魔法师的训练；受过操作奥术火炮训练的人一般被称为投弹手。一个典型的投弹手可以使用魔法师的属性块，但他们也知道一个或多个法术，他们只能用一个焦点来施放--比如（%0%）或（%1%）。所以一个Aundairian专家可能能够通过一个焦点产生{@spell cloudkill}，但不能单独施放该法术。投弹手在施放这些法术时不使用法术槽；相反，他们使用被称为{@i breath of Siberys}的龙石溶液为武器打底。",
	"However, player characters are more versatile than magewrights or bombardiers. The DM could allow your spellcasting character to use artillery without penalty if it fits the needs of the story or if you have a background that justifies it—for example, if you're a wizard with the soldier background. Otherwise, the DM could say that you can operate it at a penalty: you can't cast spells or make attacks at long range; your attack rolls have disadvantage; and saving throws against your attacks have advantage. As a player character, you can prime the weapon using the {@i breath of Siberys}, or you can expend a spell slot as usual when priming the artillery.": "然而，玩家角色比魔法师或投弹手的用途更广泛。DM可以允许你的法术角色使用火炮而不受惩罚，如果这符合故事的需要，或者你的背景证明了这一点--例如，如果你是一个有士兵背景的魔法师。否则，管理员可以说你可以在受到惩罚的情况下操作它：你不能在远距离施法或进行攻击；你的攻击卷有劣势；对你的攻击进行蓄力攻击有优势。作为一个玩家角色，你可以使用（%0%）给武器打底，或者像往常一样在给火炮打底时消耗一个法术槽。",
	"While arcane artillery is a powerful force, there's still a place for mundane siege engines that use physical projectiles, described in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The {@object ballista}, {@object mangonel}, and {@object trebuchet} are all common forms of artillery, seen on both the battlefield and on warships. However, just as a Thrane archer may have used an enchanted bow, the siege engines of the Last War are enhanced with magical power.": "虽然奥术火炮是一种强大的力量，但使用物理弹丸的世俗攻城引擎仍有一席之地，在《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》的第八章中有所描述。{@object ballista}、{@object mangonel}和{@object trebuchet}都是常见的火炮形式，在战场上和战舰上都能看到。然而，就像瑟兰弓箭手可能使用被施了魔法的弓一样，最后战争的攻城引擎也是用魔法力量加强的。",
	"A siege engine can be partially animated, speeding its use. Generally, an animated engine loads itself while the crew aims it, requiring only two actions to fire an animated ballista or three to use an animated mangonel. House Cannith also manufactured fully animated siege engines, capable of self-aiming. Such an engine required the same number of actions to aim and fire as a crewed engine, it simply had no need of a crew. However, these engines could only follow simple instructions and had little ability to adapt, requiring clear, absolute orders to be effective: {@i \"Continue to attack the north tower until it is destroyed.\"}": "攻城车可以部分动画化，以加快其使用速度。一般来说，在工作人员瞄准它的时候，动画引擎会自动加载，只需要两个动作就可以发射动画弹幕，或者三个动作就可以使用动画芒果。坎尼斯家族还制造了完全动画化的攻城引擎，能够自我瞄准。这样的引擎在瞄准和发射时所需的行动次数与有船员的引擎相同，它只是不需要船员。然而，这些引擎只能听从简单的指令，没有什么适应能力，需要明确、绝对的命令才能有效：（%0%）。",
	"A {@object cannon} is a weapon that can inflict significant bludgeoning damage at great distances. As noted in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, a cannon doesn't have to use gunpowder, and those used in the Last War did not. The most common form of cannon is the {@i elemental cannon} produced by the gnomes of Zilargo, which uses the essence of a bound earth elemental to project stone cannonballs with tremendous force; Zilargo began supplying Breland with these weapons toward the end of the Last War. While Cannith and the Five Nations experimented with other cannon models, the {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} typically filled this role on the battlefield.": "{@object cannon}是一种可以在很远的距离上造成巨大的打击性伤害的武器。如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}所述，大炮不一定要使用火药，在最后一次战争中使用的大炮就没有。最常见的加农炮是由Zilargo的地精生产的{@i elemental cannon}，它使用一个被束缚的土元素的精华来投射具有巨大力量的石制炮弹；Zilargo在最后一次战争结束时开始向布雷兰德提供这些武器。虽然坎尼斯和五国试验了其他的大炮型号，但{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}通常在战场上充当这一角色。",
	"Ballista bolts and mangonel missiles are often enchanted with spell effects that trigger when the bolt strikes its target. This effect is in addition to the standard damage inflicted by the siege engine.": "弩炮弹和芒果导弹通常被赋予法术效果，当弩炮弹击中目标时就会触发。这种效果是在攻城机造成的标准伤害之外的。",
	"{@i Explosive ammunition} affects a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the bolt. Any creature in the area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 3d6}) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Typically, {@i explosive ammunition} deals fire damage, igniting flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. However, Karrnathi {@i deathbolts} deal necrotic damage and only harm living creatures, while Thrane {@i Tira's tears} deal radiant damage.": "{@i Explosive ammunition}影响到以闪电冲击为中心的30英尺半径范围的球体。区域内的任何生物必须做一个{@dc 15}灵巧的蓄力动作，蓄力失败会受到10({@damage 3d6})的伤害，蓄力成功会受到一半的伤害。通常情况下，{@i explosive ammunition}会造成火灾伤害，点燃没有被穿戴或携带的易燃物品。然而，Karrnathi {@i deathbolts}会造成坏死伤害，并且只伤害生物，而Thrane {@i Tira's tears}会造成辐射伤害。",
	"{@i Summoning ammunition} conjures creatures around the point of impact. Aundairian {@i firestones} produce a temporary flaming sphere that randomly rolls around the area of impact. Zil binders developed a more powerful form of this ammunition which casts {@spell conjure elemental} on detonation, but it is extremely costly and rare.": "{@i Summoning ammunition}在撞击点周围召唤生物。Aundairian {@i firestones}产生一个临时的火焰球体，随机地在撞击区域周围滚动。齐尔捆绑器开发了一种更强大的这种弹药，在引爆时施放{@spell conjure elemental}，但它非常昂贵且罕见。",
	"{@i Panic stones} force all creatures within a 90-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the stone to make a {@dc 12} Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw drops whatever it is holding and becomes {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use the {@action Dash} action to move away from the {@i panic stone}. If an affected creature ends its turn more than 90 feet away from the {@i panic stone}, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for that creature.": "{@i Panic stones}迫使以石头撞击为中心的90英尺半径范围内的所有生物做一个{@dc 12}智慧反射。任何失败的生物都会丢掉手中的东西，并在1分钟内变得（%2%）。受到惊吓的生物必须使用{@action Dash}行动来远离{@i panic stone}。如果受影响的生物在距离（%5%）超过90英尺的地方结束其回合，它可以做一个智慧救赎动作。拯救成功后，该生物的效果就会结束。",
	"The {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron} is the most common form of magical explosive used in the Five Nations. While {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} serve a similar role to bombs or landmines, they can produce a wide range of magical effects; a {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron} could trigger a burst of confusion and start a riot, or summon a rampaging elemental into a crowded town square.": "{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron}是五国中最常见的魔法爆炸物形式。虽然(1%)的作用与炸弹或地雷相似，但它们可以产生广泛的魔法效果；(2%)可以引发一阵混乱并引发暴乱，或将一个狂暴的元素召唤到拥挤的城镇广场。",

	"At first glance, the damage associated with many weapons described here may seem low. How is it that a massive siege staff could end up dealing less damage than a {@item staff of fire}? But in developing weapons of war, consider who those weapons are targeting. The typical soldier in the armies of the Five Nations would use the {@creature guard} or {@creature bandit} stat block, both of which have 11 hit points. When large numbers were called for, nations would employ peasant levies, most of who would use the {@creature commoner} stat block with a mere 4 hit points.": "乍一看，这里描述的许多武器的相关伤害可能看起来很低。一个巨大的攻城杖最终造成的伤害怎么会比一个{@item staff of fire}还要低呢？但在开发战争武器时，要考虑这些武器的目标是谁。五国军队中的典型士兵会使用{@creature guard}或{@creature bandit}状态块，它们都有11点命中率。当需要大量的士兵时，国家会雇佣农民，他们中的大多数会使用仅有4点命中率的{@creature commoner}状态块。",
	"Hit points are an abstract concept, a \"combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.\" That range of 4-11 hit points is normal; a typical person on the street could be mortally wounded by a single well-placed crossbow bolt. The high hit points of exceptional individuals—such as player characters—reflect their role as heroes, people who somehow avoid a deadly strike or who can grit their teeth and persevere through damage that would send a lesser person into shock. When designing weapons and battle magic, the mages of Arcanix and artificers of the Twelve were using the typical soldier as the baseline, not a player character.": "命中率是一个抽象的概念，是 \"身体和精神的耐久性、生存意志和运气的结合\"。4-11点的命中率范围是正常的；街上的一个普通人可能会被一个位置良好的弩箭射中而受致命伤。特殊个体的高命中率--比如玩家角色--反映了他们作为英雄的角色，他们以某种方式避免了致命的一击，或者能够咬紧牙关，坚持完成会让一个较小的人陷入休克的伤害。在设计武器和战斗魔法时，阿卡尼克斯的法师和十二星座的工匠们是以典型的士兵为基准，而不是以玩家角色为基准。",
	"So consider the {@spell fireball}. It has a range of 150 feet, affects a 20-foot sphere, and deals {@damage 8d6} fire damage. This is designed for an elite squad fighting against exceptional foes: it deals high damage with a significant area of effect. But imagine you're fighting 120 guards with longbows, who start shooting at you once you enter their long range of 600 feet. You may never get close enough to cast your {@spell fireball}. Even if you do, the damage output is far greater than you need (an average of 28 damage against enemies with 11 hit points). {@spell Fireball} is an excellent tool for a small squad engaging powerful foes, which describes the typical party of adventurers. But on a battlefield of common soldiers, it proves inefficient, as range and radius are more important than high damage output. The {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} may not inflict as much damage as a {@item staff of fire}, but it hits more enemies and from farther away.": "所以要考虑（%0%）。它的范围是150英尺，影响20英尺的范围，并造成{@damage 8d6}的火力伤害。这是为精英小队对抗特殊敌人而设计的：它能造成高额伤害，并有很大的影响范围。但想象一下，你正在与120名手持长弓的卫兵作战，一旦你进入他们600英尺的远距离范围，他们就开始向你射击。你可能永远无法接近到足以施放你的（%2%）。即使你做到了，伤害输出也远远超过你的需要（对11点命中率的敌人平均28点伤害）。{@spell Fireball}是一个小队对付强大敌人的优秀工具，这就是典型的冒险者队伍。但在普通士兵的战场上，它被证明是低效的，因为范围和半径比高伤害输出更重要。(4%)的伤害可能没有(5%)的多，但它能从更远的地方击中更多的敌人。",
	"This impacts how scenes unfold when your player character is on the battlefield. In the interests of story, the DM doesn't want your party to be wiped out by the first blast of a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}; how is that a compelling adventure? Instead, that blast might deal only 12 points of fire damage. It drops half of the soldiers accompanying you (who failed their saving throws), but you and your companions take shelter from the worst of the blast and keep pressing forward. {@damage 3d6} damage may feel low because it won't kill a player character. But it can kill commoners and typical soldiers; the fact that adventurers can keep going under fire shows how remarkable they are.": "这影响到你的玩家角色在战场上的场景如何展开。为了故事的利益，DM不希望你的队伍被{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}的第一次爆炸所消灭；这怎么会是一次引人注目的冒险呢？相反，那场爆炸可能只造成12点火力伤害。它使与你同行的士兵中的一半人死亡（他们的救赎失败），但你和你的同伴们躲避了最严重的爆炸，继续向前推进。(1%）的伤害可能感觉很低，因为它不会杀死一个玩家角色。但它可以杀死平民和典型的士兵；冒险者能在炮火下继续前进，说明他们是多么了不起。",
	"While the elemental airship is a recent innovation, aerial combat has long been a part of warfare. Flying scouts are a basic component of reconnaissance.

The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the {@i war staff} and {@i battle rod}. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it's no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people \"arcane dragoons.\" If you fight your battles with {@spell fire bolt} or {@spell sacred flame}, you're known as a \"wandslinger.\"": "魔法是会进化的。当加利法尔一世建立他的王国时，他的巫师们还没有掌握（%0%）或（%1%）。咒语--可以随意使用的休闲法术--的发展花了几个世纪，因为奥术大会研究了Aereni技术和巫术的力量。联合王国的士兵们依靠的是剑和弓。但是，随着最后一次战争的开始，Aundair对其资源进行了评估。由于奥术大会的存在，昂代尔在神秘主义教育方面领先于加利法尔。组建了第一个奥术兵团，昂代尔开发了{@i war staff}和{@i battle rod}。在最后一次战争的过程中，这些技术传遍了五国和其他国家。今天，看到强悍的探究者或哨兵元帅一手拿着剑，一手拿着魔杖，并不奇怪。但没有人称这些人为 \"奥术兵\"。如果你用（4%）或（5%）打仗，你就被称为 \"魔杖客\"。",

If so, do you display it prominently? Do you carry your {@item fernian ash wand|ERLW|wand of Fernian ash} with pride, twirling it and doing flame tricks? If so, you're a wandslinger.

	"Since NPCs don't follow the same rules as player characters and player characters are exceptional, the DM may decide that an NPC wandslinger needs an arcane focus in order to cast a spell. Player characters are versatile; it's useful for you to have a wand, but you can work around its absence. The typical arcane dragoon needs a wand, rod, or staff in order to cast a spell or cantrip. Here are a few examples of NPC wandslingers:": "由于NPC不遵循与玩家角色相同的规则，而且玩家角色是例外的，所以DM可以决定NPC魔杖手需要一个奥术焦点才能施法。玩家角色是多面手；你有一根魔杖是很有用的，但你可以绕过它的缺失。典型的奥术龙人需要一根魔杖、棒子或法杖，以便施展法术或咒语。这里有几个NPC使用魔杖的例子。",

	"While wandslingers are becoming more commonplace, at the moment this is still an elite specialty. By adding wandslinger capabilities to a standard stat block, such as a guard, you are reflecting specialized training, much like a player character acquiring a feat. If you want to add more national flavor to current or former soldiers, you can add different feats to a stat block. Thrane is known for its archers; if you want to represent an elite Thrane archer, you could use the scout stat block but add the benefits of the {@feat Sharpshooter} feat. Karrnath fielded exceptional heavy infantry, and a Karrnathi knight could gain the benefits of {@feat Heavy Armor Master}.": "虽然魔杖手正变得越来越普遍，但目前这仍然是一个精英专业。通过将巫师的能力添加到一个标准的状态块中，比如说一个卫兵，你就反映了专门的训练，就像玩家角色获得一个壮举。如果你想给现在或以前的士兵添加更多的国家色彩，你可以在一个状态块中添加不同的功绩。瑟兰以其弓箭手而闻名；如果你想表现一个精锐的瑟兰弓箭手，你可以使用侦察兵的状态块，但要加上{@feat Sharpshooter}的壮举的好处。卡尔纳特（Karrnath）的重装步兵非常出色，一个卡尔纳特的骑士可以获得（%1%）的好处。",
	"As Aundair expanded the use of arcane dragoons, it saw the need for spells that could match the range of the Thrane archers, or bring down large numbers of peasant levies. {@spell Force blast|ExploringEberron} is a simple spell that lacks the offensive punch of a {@spell fire bolt}, but has greater range than a longbow and a rarely resisted damage type. {@spell Concussive burst|ExploringEberron} isn't as deadly as {@spell burning hands} or {@spell thunderwave}, but it covers the same area as a {@spell fireball} while being accessible to a wandslinger. These spells may not appeal to player characters, but you could find them in the hands of enemy wandslingers.": "随着昂代尔扩大了对奥术龙骑兵的使用，它看到了对能与瑟兰弓箭手的射程相匹配的法术的需求，或者说能打倒大量农民军的法术。{@spell Force blast|ExploringEberron}是一种简单的法术，缺乏{@spell fire bolt}的攻击力，但比长弓的射程更大，而且是一种很少被抵抗的伤害类型。{@spell Concussive burst|ExploringEberron}不像{@spell burning hands}或{@spell thunderwave}那样致命，但它覆盖的范围与{@spell fireball}相同，同时也能让魔杖手接触到。这些法术可能对玩家角色没有吸引力，但你可以在敌人的巫师手中找到它们。",
	"The wandslinger is trained to use an arcane focus: the power isn't in the wand, it's simply a tool for channeling a spell. But what of magic wands, staffs, and rods? Under the wide-magic principles of Eberron, common and uncommon items are part of the magical industry; rare items are exotic and expensive; and very rare and legendary items are largely beyond the capabilities of Cannith and the Arcane Congress. As such, weapons such as a {@item wand of fireballs} or {@item wand of lightning bolts} could be found on the battlefield, especially when dealing with Aundair, but they were rare, only assigned to elite units and critical operations.": "魔杖手接受了使用奥术焦点的训练：力量不在魔杖里，它只是一个引导咒语的工具。但是魔杖、法杖和棒子呢？在Eberron的广泛魔法原则下，普通和不普通的物品是魔法产业的一部分；稀有物品是异国情调和昂贵的；而非常稀有和传奇的物品基本上超出了Cannith和奥术大会的能力。因此，像{@item wand of fireballs}或{@item wand of lightning bolts}这样的武器可以在战场上找到，特别是在对付昂代尔的时候，但它们很罕见，只分配给精英部队和关键行动。",
	"However, House Cannith and Aundair's Arcane Congress are always working to produce more efficient weapons, and the {@item wand of magic missiles} is one such recent development. Prior versions of the wand were more expensive, could only be used by trained spellcasters, or didn't regain charges. The {@item wand of magic missiles} breaks this barrier: it's an uncommon magic item that doesn't require attunement and can be used by any creature. A wealthy wandslinger could carry a brace of wands, unleashing a barrage of bolts from a new wand each round. {@item Wands of magic missiles} may be found in the hands of criminal enforcers, royal guards, or any number of other professionals, and can potentially be purchased across the Five Nations. However, they were perfected by the Arcane Congress just twelve years ago, and House Cannith has yet to replicate that technique. As a result, these wands are primarily found in Aundair or used by Aundairians; a wand being sold in Sharn may be surplus or salvage recovered from Aundairian soldiers during the war.": "然而，坎尼斯家族和昂代尔的奥术大会一直在努力生产更有效的武器，{@item wand of magic missiles}就是这样的一个最新发展。之前的魔杖版本比较昂贵，只能由训练有素的施法者使用，或者不能恢复充电。1%）打破了这一障碍：它是一种不常见的魔法物品，不需要调谐，任何生物都可以使用。一个富有的魔杖手可以带着一串魔杖，每回合从一个新的魔杖中释放出一连串的子弹。{@item Wands of magic missiles}可能会出现在犯罪执行者、皇家卫队或任何其他专业人士的手中，并有可能在整个五国买到。然而，它们是由奥术大会在十二年前完善的，而坎尼斯家族还没有复制这种技术。因此，这些魔杖主要在昂代尔发现，或者由昂代尔人使用；在沙恩出售的魔杖可能是战争期间从昂代尔士兵那里回收的剩余或残余物。",
	"Sooner or later House Cannith will duplicate this item and they'll become available at any Cannith enclave. But for now, these wands can still be difficult to find outside Aundair.": "坎尼斯家族迟早会复制这种物品，它们会在任何一个坎尼斯的飞地都能买到。但现在，这些魔杖在昂代尔之外仍然很难找到。",
	"Throughout the Last War, Cyre poured gold into House Cannith's coffers, urging them to develop ever-deadlier weapons. In 959 YK, Cannith presented Queen Dannel with the first warforged titans. For a time, this gave Cyre an edge—but as always, Cannith began selling these creations to other nations, as well as selling {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} and {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs} to those who needed to fight titans.": "在整个最后一次战争中，赛尔将黄金注入坎尼斯家族的库房，敦促他们开发更多的致命武器。在公元959年，坎尼斯向丹妮尔女王展示了第一批战争锻造的泰坦巨人。一时间，这给赛尔带来了优势--但像往常一样，坎尼斯开始向其他国家出售这些作品，同时也向那些需要与泰坦战斗的人出售（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"During the Last War, the warforged titan served a number of critical roles. The mere presence of an imposing titan provided a defensive bulwark for infantry, as enemy infantry could rarely afford to engage a titan without artillery or magical support. Titans are tireless, surprisingly swift, and capable of crossing almost any terrain. Thanks to the Siege Monster ability, they are also devastatingly effective against fortifications and siege engines.": "在最后的战争中，战争锻造的泰坦有许多关键作用。一个强大的泰坦的存在为步兵提供了一个防御堡垒，因为敌人的步兵很少能在没有火炮或魔法支持的情况下与泰坦作战。泰坦是不知疲倦的，令人惊讶的迅速，并且能够穿越几乎所有的地形。得益于围攻怪物的能力，它们对防御工事和攻城引擎也有毁灭性的效果。",
	"The statistics of a basic warforged titan, as described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, grant it additional versatility from its Platforms trait. A titan has two platforms in its chassis, each designed to hold one medium or smaller creature. Typically, these platforms hold archers, providing the warforged with some minimal ranged support to complement its powerful melee attacks. However, specialized crew can dramatically increase the capabilities of a titan: an evoker can provide strong ranged attacks, while an abjurer can stand ready to counter or dispel enemy magic, and an onboard artificer can keep the titan operational. Sending your titan against Karrnathi undead? An exorcist can be a boon for dealing with undead. Alternatively, a titan could simply serve as a battering ram, carrying two spies or commandos ready to leap off and blend into an enemy community as soon as the titan breaches a defensive wall.": "如同{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}所述，基本的战神泰坦的统计资料，从它的平台特质中赋予了它额外的多功能性。泰坦的底盘上有两个平台，每个平台可以容纳一个中型或小型生物。一般来说，这些平台可以容纳弓箭手，为战神提供一些最低限度的远程支持，以补充其强大的近战攻击。然而，专门的船员可以极大地提高泰坦的能力：一个唤醒者可以提供强大的远程攻击，而一个堕落者可以随时准备反击或驱散敌人的魔法，而船上的工匠可以保持泰坦的运作。派你的泰坦去对付卡尔纳特的亡灵？驱魔师可以成为对付亡灵的利器。另外，泰坦可以简单地充当攻城车，携带两名间谍或突击队员，准备在泰坦突破防御墙后立即跳下，混入敌人社区。",
	"While the warforged titan stat block represents the basic design, over the course of nearly forty years in service, there were many variations on that design. Consider using one of these options as a way to add flavor to a titan.": "虽然战神泰坦的属性块代表了基本的设计，但在近四十年的服役过程中，这个设计有很多变化。考虑使用这些选项中的一个，作为增加泰坦的风味的一种方式。",
	"One of the titan's weapons can be replaced with an integrated ballista. This weapon is self-loading and conjures ammunition. If the titan has an armbow, replace either the axehand or hammerfist with the following attack:": "泰坦的一种武器可以被替换成综合弹弓。这种武器可以自动装弹，并能变出弹药。如果泰坦有一个臂弓，用以下的攻击方式取代斧手或锤拳。",

	"Late in the war, Cannith developed titans that had only one platform, with a {@object long rod|ExploringEberron} (as described in the \"Arcane Artillery\" section) integrated in place of the other platform.": "在战争后期，坎尼斯开发了只有一个平台的泰坦巨人，在另一个平台的位置上集成了一个（%0%）（如 \"奥术火炮 \"部分所述）。",
	"Titans serving in particular regions were often shielded against a relevant type of elemental damage. For example, force and fire were the damage types most typically tied to {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} or {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs}, so Cannith often designed titans with resistance to one of these damage types.": "在特定地区服役的泰坦常常被屏蔽在相关类型的元素伤害之外。例如，力和火是最典型的与{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}或{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs}相关的伤害类型，所以坎尼斯在设计泰坦时经常对这些伤害类型之一进行抵抗。",
	"The titan has a hollow space within its chassis and can carry up to 6 Medium creatures or extra cargo. Due to the loss of body mass, a model made for transport only has an Armor Class of 18 and 100 hit points, but increases its walking speed to 45 feet.": "泰坦的底盘内有一个中空的空间，最多可以携带6个中型生物或额外的货物。由于身体质量的损失，为运输而制造的模型只有18的装甲等级和100的命中率，但将其行走速度提高到45英尺。",
	"While called \"warforged,\" the titans are quite different from the truly living constructs that came after them. Titans have limited sentience. They imprint on their commanders, and to a lesser degree, on the uniforms of their allies. They can follow orders and general instructions such as \"protect allies\" or \"engage enemies.\" But as a rule, titans don't feel emotion, reflected by the fact that they're immune to being charmed or frightened. Today, most remaining titans are simply waiting in storage, content to remain motionless until it's time to serve again.": "虽然被称为 \"战神\"，但泰坦与他们之后的真正的生命体有很大不同。泰坦拥有有限的知觉。他们在指挥官身上留下印记，在较小的程度上，在他们的盟友的制服上留下印记。它们可以服从命令和一般指令，如 \"保护盟友 \"或 \"与敌人交战\"。但通常情况下，泰坦巨人不会感受到情感，这体现在他们对被迷惑或被惊吓是免疫的。今天，大多数剩余的泰坦只是在仓库里等待，满足于保持不动，直到再次服务的时间。",
	"Yet there are stories of titans who've developed full consciousness. If the tales are true, this could be the result of rogue artificers (possibly cultists of the Traveler hidden within House Cannith), or it could be a random spark of evolution—suggesting that the potential for sentience lies within all titans.": "然而，有一些关于泰坦巨人发展出完整意识的故事。如果这些故事是真的，这可能是流氓工匠（可能是隐藏在坎尼斯家族中的旅行者的崇拜者）的结果，也可能是进化的随机火花--暗示着所有泰坦都有潜在的智慧。",
	"A sentient titan loses its immunity to psychic damage. It's no longer immune to being frightened or charmed, but it has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause these conditions. Its Intelligence increases to 10 (or higher) and it is capable of making its own decisions.": "有知觉的泰坦失去了对精神伤害的免疫力。它不再对被惊吓或被迷惑有免疫力，但它对造成这些情况的效果有救命的优势。它的智力增加到10（或更高），并且能够做出自己的决定。",

	"There are challenges facing every society, problems that need to be solved. Communication. Transportation. Even entertainment. In Khorvaire, magic is the tool people use to solve these problems.

	"The Five Nations are built on a foundation of magical tools and services. Arcane magic is understood to be a form of science: anyone with the aptitude for it can train at a house trade school to become a magewright or learn how to be a wandslinger. There's nothing strange about seeing an airship in the sky or sending a message to a distant friend using a {@item speaking stone|ERLW}.": "五国是建立在魔法工具和服务的基础上的。奥术魔法被理解为一种科学形式：任何有这方面才能的人都可以在房屋贸易学校接受培训，成为一名魔法师，或者学习如何成为一名魔杖手。在天空中看到一艘飞艇，或者用{@item speaking stone|ERLW}给远方的朋友发送消息，这并不奇怪。",
	"However, a common maxim about Khorvaire is that it possesses \"wide magic, not high magic.\" While the {@item speaking stone|ERLW} allows you to send messages between two stone stations, {@spell sending} is a rarer service that fewer people can afford. {@spell Lesser restoration} is available at any good Jorasco healing house, but {@spell raise dead} isn't so trivial.": "然而，关于霍尔韦尔的一句常见格言是，它拥有 \"广泛的魔法，而不是高超的魔法\"。虽然{@item speaking stone|ERLW}可以让你在两个石站之间发送消息，但{@spell sending}是一种比较罕见的服务，很少有人能负担得起。{@spell Lesser restoration}在任何好的乔拉斯科治疗所都可以得到，但{@spell raise dead}就不是那么微不足道了。",
	"As a broad rule, the people of Khorvaire are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or spells of 1st and 2nd level. They're familiar with 3rd-level spells—{@spell fireball||fireballs} on the battlefield, aristocrats using Sivis {@spell sending} services—but these things are expensive. Effects of 4th or 5th level are known—Orien maintains a network of teleportation circles, the dead can be raised, an oracle can cast {@spell divination}—but these things aren't part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn't expect to run into them. Magical effects of 6th level or higher are usually the product of more advanced civilizations—the dragons of Argonnessen, the elves of Aerenal, the ancient giants of Xen'drik. The same principle applies to magic items. Common and uncommon items are part of everyday life. Rare items exist, but they're rare. And very rare and legendary items are typically the product of advanced civilizations or remarkable events.": "作为一项广泛的规则，Khorvaire的人们习惯于与那些模仿一、二级咒语或法术的工具和服务打交道。他们熟悉三级法术--{@spell fireball||fireballs}在战场上，贵族们使用Sivis{@spell sending}服务--但这些东西都很昂贵。四级或五级的效果是已知的--奥利安维持着一个传送圈网络，死人可以复活，神谕者可以施展（%2%）--但这些东西并不是日常生活的一部分，一般的平民不会期望碰到它们。六级以上的魔法效果通常是更先进的文明的产物--阿贡尼森的龙，艾瑞纳的精灵，Xen'drik的古代巨人。同样的原则也适用于魔法物品。普通和不普通的物品是日常生活的一部分。稀有物品存在，但它们很罕见。而非常稀有和传奇的物品通常是先进文明或非凡事件的产物。",
	"There are exceptions to this rule. There are higher-level spellcasters in the world: Mordain the Fleshweaver, Jaela Daran, the Great Druid Oalian. But civilization is built on a foundation of common and uncommon items, and spells of 3rd level and below. High-level spellcasters are capable of remarkable feats, but these can't yet be mass produced.": "这条规则也有例外。世界上有更高级别的施法者。编肉者莫尔丹、杰拉-达兰、大德鲁伊-奥里安。但文明是建立在普通和不普通的物品以及3级及以下法术的基础上的。高级别的法术师能够做出非凡的功绩，但这些还不能大规模生产。",
	"Common magic items are common throughout Khorvaire. This isn't to say they are trivial—{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} sets the price of a common magic item at {@dice 2d4*10|2d4 × 10} gp, so even the simplest item will cost 20 gp. A farmer might treasure her {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} and the gown of {@item clothes of mending|XGE} that has been in her family for generations, while a wealthy young noble may flaunt his {@item glamerweave|ERLW} and {@item cloak of many fashions|XGE}.": "普通魔法物品在整个Khorvaire都很常见。这并不是说它们是微不足道的--{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}规定普通魔法物品的价格为{@dice 2d4*10|2d4 × 10}gp，所以即使是最简单的物品也要花费20gp。一个农民可能会珍惜她的{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}和她家世代相传的{@item clothes of mending|XGE}的长袍，而一个富有的年轻贵族可能会炫耀他的{@item glamerweave|ERLW}和{@item cloak of many fashions|XGE}。",
	"Common magic items generally aren't all sold in one place. A high-class tailor will sell both mundane and magical clothes, but you can't buy an everbright lantern at their shop.

	"Beyond this, consider that both in price and description, there's a wide range of quality between items, reflected in the range of price. A 20 gp {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} is ugly but functional, while for 80 gp you can get one inlaid with beautiful patterns, and you might even be able to adjust the shade and brilliance of the light source. {@item Glamerweave|ERLW} is clothing that's been imbued with illusions: both the quality of the base clothing and the illusion factor into the cost, and the finest glamerweave can be far more than 80 gp. In short, the magic item description tells you what a common item {@i does}, but it's also an object beyond that, and it's good to think about its form and quality.": "除此之外，考虑到无论是价格还是描述，物品之间的质量差异很大，反映在价格范围上。一个20戈比（%0%）的东西很丑，但很实用，而花80戈比就可以得到一个镶嵌着美丽图案的东西，你甚至可以调整光源的阴影和亮度。(1%)是被注入了幻觉的衣服：基本衣服的质量和幻觉都是成本的考虑因素，而最好的冰晶织品可能远远超过80戈比。简而言之，魔法物品描述告诉你什么是普通物品（%2%），但它也是一个超出这个范围的物品，考虑一下它的形式和质量是很好的。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} only calls out common magic items, but at the DM's discretion, uncommon magic items can also be purchased in major cities (especially in Aundair). Such items are more expensive—the price is typically between 200-500 gp, set by the DM based on the power and quality of the item—but selection will be far more limited. Just because you could theoretically purchase a {@item cloak of protection} doesn't mean one is always available in that particular shop or town. However, an exceptional weaponsmith may have a {@item +1 weapon} for sale or take a commission to create one, and large House Sivis enclaves often sell {@item sending stones}. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide what sort of uncommon magic items are available and who is selling them.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}只叫出了常见的魔法物品，但根据DM的决定，不常见的魔法物品也可以在主要城市（尤其是在Aundair）购买。这类物品更加昂贵--价格通常在200-500戈比之间，由DM根据物品的威力和质量来确定--但选择也会更加有限。理论上你能买到（1%）并不意味着在那个特定的商店或城镇里总能买到。然而，一个出色的武器匠可能会有一个{@item +1 weapon}出售，或者接受委托制造一个，而大型的西维斯家族飞地经常出售{@item sending stones}。归根结底，要由DM来决定什么样的不常见的魔法物品是可用的，以及谁在出售它们。",
	"Chapter 7 includes a list of dragonmark focus items. These represent that it's easier to create an item that can only be used by someone with a dragonmark—presenting focus versions of other magic items, but with a reduced rarity. Dragonmark focus items can only be created by a character with the Mark of Making or the dragonmark used by the item; while they are more common than similar items that work for unmarked characters, they are typically only available through the dragonmarked houses and often only as rewards for house service.": "第七章包括一份龙纹重点物品的清单。这些物品代表着更容易创造出只有拥有龙纹的人才能使用的物品--呈现出其他魔法物品的焦点版本，但稀有度降低。龙纹聚焦物品只能由拥有制造印记或物品所使用的龙纹的角色创造；虽然它们比对无印记的角色有效的类似物品更常见，但它们通常只能通过有龙纹的家族获得，而且往往只能作为家族服务的奖励。",
	"Most magic items are portable and designed for adventurers. However, you may also encounter magic items that are meant for industrial use. Just as a dragonmark focus item is easier to create because of its limitations, a large, immovable industrial item can make a rare or uncommon item's properties accessible to the public. An Aundairian village may have a large {@item cleansing stone|ERLW} set into the town square. If a theater has a magical tool that can generate {@spell minor illusion||minor illusions}, it could be similar in size and shape to a pipe organ. Essentially, in thinking about the magical items that people may encounter, keep in mind that they aren't necessarily designed for use in adventuring!": "大多数魔法物品都是便携式的，为冒险者设计。然而，你也可能遇到为工业用途设计的魔法物品。就像龙纹重点物品因其局限性而更容易创造一样，一个大型的、不可移动的工业物品可以使一个稀有或不常见的物品的属性为公众所了解。一个Aundairian村庄可能有一个大型的（%0%）设置在城镇广场。如果一个剧院有一个能产生（%1%）的魔法工具，它的大小和形状可能与管风琴相似。基本上，在思考人们可能遇到的魔法物品时，请记住它们不一定是为了在冒险中使用而设计的!",
	"The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the {@creature magewright|ERLW|magewrights}: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright knows few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they're able to cast them in ways others cannot.": "Eberron的魔法经济是建立在{@creature magewright|ERLW|magewrights}的基础上的：那些知道少数几个咒语或仪式的施法者，使他们能够提供重要的服务。巫师是出类拔萃的；他们通过几个小时的学习就能准备好任何法术，这反映了他们非凡的天赋和多才多艺。相比之下，魔法师知道的法术很少，但由于他们对这些法术的强烈关注，他们能够以其他人无法做到的方式施展这些法术。",
	"An artificer is equally exceptional. Most of the people assembling magic items at Cannith forgeholds aren't artificers; they work using industrialized processes, massive tools that enhance the creation process (like the {@i creation forge}), and house resources. These craftspeople couldn't just create a wand at home alone. By contrast, as an artificer, you are unconventional, using personalized techniques and improvising solutions.": "一个工匠同样是个例外。在Cannith锻造厂组装魔法物品的大多数人都不是工匠；他们使用工业化的流程、增强创造过程的大型工具（比如（%0%））和房屋资源来工作。这些工匠不可能只在家里单独创造一根魔杖。相比之下，作为一个工匠，你是非常规的，使用个性化的技术和即兴的解决方案。",
	"Just because {@i you} can create any common magic item with little time and effort doesn't mean that this is typical or that others could duplicate your work. Never forget that in Eberron, {@i player characters are exceptional}. Even at low levels, you have potential that the common magewright can't match. There are also exceptional NPCs, ones who can do things player characters cannot; but remember that as a player character, not everyone who follows your path can match your abilities.": "仅仅因为{@i you}可以用很少的时间和精力创造任何普通的魔法物品，并不意味着这是典型的，或者其他人可以复制你的工作。永远不要忘记，在Eberron，（%1%）。即使在低级别的情况下，你也有普通魔法师无法比拟的潜力。也有出类拔萃的NPC，那些能做到玩家角色无法做到的事情；但请记住，作为一个玩家角色，并不是每个追随你的人都能与你的能力相媲美。",
	"For simplicity's sake, magewrights cast spells from the existing spell lists. But magewright spells are unique in a few ways. First of all, magewrights cast all their spells as rituals—even spells that don't normally have the ritual tag. The drawback is that they can only be cast as rituals with an extended casting time. All magewright spells have a minimum casting time of 10 minutes, and the DM can choose to give a spell an even longer casting time; it may take a medium a full hour to cast {@spell speak with dead}.": "为了简单起见，魔法师从现有的法术列表中施展法术。但魔法师的法术在几个方面是独特的。首先，魔法师把他们所有的法术都当作仪式来施放--即使是那些通常没有仪式标签的法术。缺点是，它们只能作为有延长施法时间的仪式来施放。所有魔法师的法术都有至少10分钟的施法时间，而DM可以选择给一个法术更长的施法时间；它可能需要一个中等人整整一个小时来施法（%0%）。",
	"As magewrights can only cast spells as rituals, they don't use spell slots. But they do require a surge of magical energy to power the spell, typically generated by refined Eberron dragonshards, the fuel of arcane industry.": "由于魔法师只能以仪式的形式施展法术，他们不使用法术槽。但他们确实需要大量的魔法能量来驱动咒语，这些能量通常由精炼的艾伯伦龙石产生，是奥术工业的燃料。",
	"When a magewright performs a ritual, it consumes an amount of Eberron dragonshards worth 20 gp × the spell's level, in addition to any costly material components of the spell. This is the cost to the magewright to cast the spell; they might charge far more for offering that service to others, generally at least twice the casting cost. Following the general limitations of everyday magic, it's unusual to encounter a magewright that can cast a spell of 4th level or higher, and any such magewright would likely charge a significant premium for their services.": "当一个魔法师执行一个仪式时，除了法术中任何昂贵的物质成分外，它还会消耗价值为20gp×法术等级的Eberron龙石。这是魔法师施法的成本；他们为他人提供服务时可能会收取更多的费用，通常至少是施法成本的两倍。按照日常魔法的一般限制，能施放四级或更高级别的法术的魔法师并不多见，任何这样的魔法师都可能为他们的服务收取相当高的费用。",
	"Here are two new cantrips you might find employed by a magewright, other NPC, or player character in Khorvaire.": "这里有两个新的咒语，你可能会发现魔法师、其他NPC或玩家角色在霍尔韦尔使用的咒语。",
	"At DM discretion, a magewright's spells may have expanded—or limited—effects. Consider what it takes to make a spell a viable commercial service. For example, {@spell augury} only allows the caster to predict events 30 minutes in the future—useful for adventurers in the midst of a dungeon, but not for the farmer wanting an opinion on planting crops. A professional oracle might be able to predict woe or weal anywhere from a day to a week in advance—but such an oracle could have very specific limitations, such as only being able to make predictions related to weather or agriculture. As a DM, use the existing spells as a model, but adjust them as necessary to create a viable business.": "根据DM的决定，魔法师的法术可以有扩大的或有限的效果。考虑如何才能使一个法术成为可行的商业服务。例如，{@spell augury}只允许施法者预测未来30分钟内的事件--这对在地牢中的冒险者来说是有用的，但对想要对种植庄稼提出意见的农民来说就不是了。一个专业的神谕者也许能够提前一天到一周预测祸福，但这样的神谕者可能有非常具体的限制，比如只能预测与天气或农业有关的事情。作为DM，使用现有的法术作为模型，但要根据需要进行调整，以创建一个可行的企业。",
	"Player characters can't duplicate these effects. The unique aspects of magewright spells reflect both their devotion to a single subject and personal aptitude; the oracle has a unique talent for divination that even a diviner wizard can't replicate. Player characters have unmatched potential and great versatility; magewrights are extremely limited, but have unique advantages.": "玩家角色无法复制这些效果。魔法师法术的独特之处，既反映了他们对单一主题的奉献，也反映了个人的能力；神谕者在占卜方面有独特的天赋，即使是占卜师的巫师也无法复制。玩家角色具有无可比拟的潜力和极大的通用性；魔法师的能力极其有限，但却有独特的优势。",
	"In Aerenal, almost every citizen knows a few cantrips. The Five Nations aren't quite so advanced; there, cantrips are common, but still reflect specialized training. Most people rely on common magic items; a magewright can be proud of their talents, though just as magewrights have a narrow spell selection, their cantrips are also more limited than those used by player characters. A magewright chef uses effects similar to {@spell prestidigitation} to heat and flavor food, but they can't conjure illusions or extinguish flames. The idea is that the most versatile cantrips—such as {@spell prestidigitation} and {@spell thaumaturgy}—represent knowledge of a range of discrete spell effects, all categorized under one greater cantrip. Your spell list merely says {@spell prestidigitation}, but that encompasses a host of lesser cantrips; when you extinguish a fire, you're actually casting {@i incendiary purge}, and when you chill your drink, you're performing {@i culinary transmutation}. While this has no effect on player characters, consider that magewrights and other lesser spellcasters might only know limited forms of common cantrips, such as the following:": "在Aerenal，几乎每个公民都知道一些咒语。五国并不那么先进；在那里，咒语很常见，但仍然反映了专门的训练。大多数人都依赖普通的魔法物品；魔法师可以为自己的才能感到自豪，不过就像魔法师的法术选择很窄一样，他们的咒语也比玩家角色使用的咒语更有限。魔法师的厨师使用类似于（%0%）的效果来加热和调味食物，但他们不能施展幻术或熄灭火焰。我们的想法是，最通用的咒语--比如{@spell prestidigitation}和{@spell thaumaturgy}--代表了一系列不连续的法术效果的知识，都被归入一个更大的咒语。你的法术清单上只写着（%3%），但这包含了一系列较小的咒语；当你灭火时，你实际上是在施放（%4%），而当你冷却饮料时，你在执行（%5%）。虽然这对玩家角色没有影响，但考虑到魔法师和其他较低级的施法者可能只知道普通咒语的有限形式，比如说以下这些。",

	"Magewrights weave magic into their work. They are not only limited spellcasters, but skilled professionals who use magic as a tool. In addition to a limited range of magic ability, magewrights are also skilled in the mundane aspects of their specialty. A magewright chef doesn't make food by snapping their fingers; they're skilled with cook's utensils, as well as using {@i culinary transmutation} and {@i Zolan zest} as tools in their repertoire. Below are a few examples of magewright professions.": "魔法师将魔法编织到他们的工作中。他们不仅是有限的施法者，而且是将魔法作为一种工具的熟练的专业人员。除了有限的魔法能力之外，魔法师还精通他们专业的世俗方面。魔法师的厨师不是靠打响指就能做出食物的；他们熟练使用厨具，以及使用（%0%）和（%1%）作为他们剧目中的工具。以下是几个关于魔法师职业的例子。",

	"No dragonmarked house trains mediums. Instead, some come from communities steeped in the Blood of Vol, while others are Vassals who invoke Aureon and the Keeper. A medium performs {@spell speak with dead} as a ritual, and many use a form of {@spell minor illusion} to conjure up an image of the deceased in conjunction with the ritual. Some less-scrupulous mediums rely on {@skill Insight}, {@spell History}, or {@spell Deception} to simulate speaking with the dead without going through the full ritual.": "没有龙纹屋会训练媒介。相反，有些人来自于深受沃尔之血影响的社区，而有些人则是召唤奥瑞恩和守护者的附庸。灵媒将{@spell speak with dead}作为一种仪式来执行，许多人在仪式中使用{@spell minor illusion}的形式来召唤出死者的形象。一些不那么狡猾的灵媒依靠（%2%）、（%3%）或（%4%）来模拟与死者对话，而不经过完整的仪式。",

	"Licensed by the Warning Guild of House Medani, truthtellers are proficient in {@skill Insight} and can cast {@spell zone of truth} as a ritual.

	"Arcane magic is a science—magewrights master its techniques. However, there are other forms of magic which can likewise be adapted to everyday functions. An adept derives their magic from their faith, a more limited form of what a cleric can do; similarly, a gleaner masters the simplest forms of druidic magic. Especially with the adept, this is more of a calling than a job; you don't decide to become an oracle of Aureon, you find that you are gifted with visions. The rituals of an adept invoke divine forces, while a gleaner draws on the world around them and often uses an herbalism kit as a spellcasting focus. Adepts are common in Thrane and other religious communities, while gleaners provide useful services in the Eldeen Reaches.": "奥术魔法是一门科学--魔法师们掌握着它的技术。然而，还有其他形式的魔法也同样可以适应日常功能。精通者的魔法来自于他们的信仰，是牧师所能做到的更有限的形式；同样，拾荒者掌握最简单形式的德鲁伊魔法。特别是对行者来说，这更像是一种召唤而非工作；你不是决定要成为奥瑞恩的神谕，而是发现自己有幻觉的天赋。精通者的仪式会调用神圣的力量，而拾荒者则会利用他们周围的世界，并经常使用草药包作为施法的重点。精通者在瑟恩和其他宗教团体中很常见，而拾荒者则在Eldeen Reaches提供有用的服务。",
	"The people of Eberron don't use mechanical clocks, and if you're in a Mror mine or the heart of one of Sharn's towers, you can't see the sun. So how do you tell time?": "Eberron的人们不使用机械钟，如果你在Moror矿区或Sharn的一个塔楼的中心，你就看不到太阳。那么，你是如何计算时间的呢？",
	"The answer is simple: magic. There are a wide range of cantrips that tell time—some tied to an absolute time, some tied to the moons, some set to a local time. In Eberron, any character that has the skill to cast {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell thaumaturgy}, or {@spell druidcraft} can produce an additional effect allowing them to tell time. Clocks in Eberron are common magic items, and in most major cities, bells are rung to identify the hour; three bells means \"three o'clock.\" An {@item orb of time|XGE} is another common magic item—a small polished stone disk, often connected to a chain like a pocket watch—that tells time.": "答案很简单：魔法。有各种各样的咒语可以显示时间，有些与绝对时间有关，有些与月亮有关，有些与当地时间有关。在Eberron，任何拥有施放{@spell prestidigitation}、{@spell thaumaturgy}或{@spell druidcraft}技能的角色都可以产生一个额外的效果，使他们能够判断时间。在艾伯伦，时钟是常见的魔法物品，在大多数大城市，钟声会被敲响以确定时间；三个钟声意味着 \"三点钟\"。{@item orb of time|XGE}是另一种常见的魔法物品--一个打磨过的小石盘，通常像怀表一样与一条链子相连，可以显示时间。",

	"Most theaters employ illusions to add special effects to a performance, whether provided by magewrights or static items. Dream parlors provide entirely illusory entertainment. House Phiarlan's latest innovation is the {@i crystal theater}. A large device uses a tiny scrying crystal to project an image on a screen. The crystal is tied to a single location—one of the grand stages in House Phiarlan's central demesnes. This allows the patrons of a crystal theater to watch a live performance occurring on a distant stage. As this practice expands, this could provide entertainers and bards with a global reach; Phiarlan might even pay adventurers to license the rights to dramatize their exploits.": "大多数剧院都采用幻觉来为表演增加特殊效果，无论是由魔术师还是静态物品提供。梦幻厅则提供完全虚幻的娱乐。皮亚伦家族的最新创新是（%0%）。一个大型设备使用一个微小的窥探水晶在屏幕上投射出一个图像。水晶被绑在一个单一的位置--菲亚尔兰家族中央领地的大舞台。这使得水晶剧院的观众可以观看到远处舞台上发生的现场表演。随着这种做法的扩大，这可以为艺人和吟游诗人提供全球范围的影响；Phiarlan甚至可以付钱给冒险家，让他们授权将自己的事迹戏剧化。",
	"One form of fashion that hasn't been discussed in depth is the practice of {@i cosmetic transmutation}. A magewright beautician can perform a range of minor transformations—for a price. Minor cosmetic transmutation is quite common; most professional beauticians can change your hair or eye color. Unnatural effects are rarer, seen mainly in Aundair and Zilargo; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in Fairhaven, and in the days before Galifar, the nobles of Thaliost would adopt elf features. The effects of cosmetic transmutation typically last a week, but if you're dealing with a magewright of sufficient skill, you can extend the effect to one month. In some cities, you might even find an expert who can make the change permanent. The more complicated the transmutation, the more costly—and hard to find—the service becomes.": "一种还没有被深入讨论的时尚形式是（%0%）的做法。 小规模的美容改造是很常见的；大多数专业美容师可以改变你的头发或眼睛的颜色。非自然的效果比较少见，主要出现在昂代尔和齐拉尔戈；金属发色是费尔海文最近的流行趋势，在加利法尔之前的日子里，塔利奥斯特的贵族们会采用精灵的特征。化妆品转化的效果通常会持续一周，但如果你面对的是一个有足够技能的魔法师，你可以将效果延长到一个月。在一些城市，你甚至可以找到一个专家，他可以使变化永久化。改造越复杂，服务就越昂贵，也越难找到。",

However, the standard fare is 2 sp per mile, which is modest to comfortable in its appointments. Those on a budget can book passage in steerage for only 2 cp per mile, but this is typically squalid or poor in quality, and a long journey can be dangerous.

	"Manifest zones are areas where the influence of the other planes bleeds through into the Material Plane. {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} presents some possible manifest zone effects, and chapter 5 of this book explores these in more depth. Some manifest zones are dangerous, and such regions are shunned. However, other manifest zones have effects that can be quite useful for commerce or industry, and like any natural resource, these tend to be harnessed over time. The towers of Sharn are made possible by the manifest zone to Syrania, and any other city with a similar zone could support skycoaches and high towers. Lamannian manifest zones often promote fertility and growth, and many of the greatest farms and vineyards in Khorvaire are in such zones. Ultimately, this is one more factor in the wide magic of Khorvaire: it's not simply what spells can be cast, it's that there are places in the world itself that are inherently magical.": "显化区是其他位面的影响渗入物质位面的区域。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}介绍了一些可能的显灵区效应，本书第五章对这些效应进行了更深入的探讨。有些显灵区是危险的，这样的区域被避开了。然而，其他显化区的效果对商业或工业相当有用，就像任何自然资源一样，这些效果往往会随着时间的推移而被利用起来。沙恩的塔楼是由通往西拉尼亚的显露区实现的，任何其他拥有类似显露区的城市都可以支持空中客车和高塔。拉曼尼亚的显露区经常促进肥沃和增长，霍尔韦尔许多最伟大的农场和葡萄园都在这样的区域。归根结底，这是霍尔韦尔广泛的魔力的又一个因素：这不是简单的可以施展什么法术，而是世界上有些地方本身就有魔力。",
	"Arcane magic is a science. Wizards use words of power and mystic gestures, but there are many ways to channel arcane energies—suspended in the liquid of a potion, trapped in the sigils of a scroll, or focused through a wand.": "奥术魔法是一门科学。巫师们使用力量的语言和神秘的手势，但有许多方法可以引导奥术能量--悬浮在药水的液体中，被困在卷轴的符号中，或通过魔杖集中。",
	"The artificer is an arcane engineer; instead of working directly with mystical energy, they use tools to perform wonders. In a world where wandslingers take to the battlefields and airships sail through the skies, artificers are innovators and inventors developing tools to shape the future. Chapter 6 presents two new artificer subclasses and a number of infusions, representing the diversity of artifice styles and specializations.": "工匠是一个神秘的工程师；他们不直接使用神秘的能量，而是使用工具来创造奇迹。在一个巫师走上战场、飞艇在天空中航行的世界中，工匠是创新者和发明家，他们开发工具来塑造未来。第6章介绍了两个新的工匠子类和一些灌注，代表了工匠风格和专业的多样性。",
	"As an artificer, you possess remarkable talents. You don't need the eldritch machines or vast resources that are traditionally involved in arcane industry, and can produce magical effects using just your personal tools. But what's the foundation of your magic? Are you building on the basic principles used by House Cannith or exploring less traditional paths of arcane science?": "作为一个工匠，你拥有非凡的才能。你不需要传统上涉及奥术工业的超自然机器或大量资源，只需使用你的个人工具就能产生神奇的效果。但你的魔法的基础是什么？你是建立在坎尼斯家族使用的基本原则之上，还是探索不那么传统的奥术科学之路？",
	"The {@table Artificer Techniques|ExploringEberron} table presents a few ideas. Use one of these or develop your own, considering how this affects your appearance and the way you cast your spells. Your unique style doesn't have to change any of the default rules associated with your magic. For example, you may say that you're working with principles of mundane science, but your spells will still be negated by {@spell counterspell}. Find creative ways to explain how your character's techniques interact with game rules. Perhaps some of your theories are completely false; while you believe that you're producing magical effects by talking to spirits or using Thelanian logic, it's possible you've stumbled on a different way to trigger traditional arcane reactions. If you want to explore mechanical advantages and limitations based on your unusual techniques, discuss it with your DM.": "{@table Artificer Techniques|ExploringEberron}表提出了一些想法。使用其中一个或开发你自己的，考虑这对你的外表和你施法的方式有什么影响。你的独特风格不必改变任何与你的魔法相关的默认规则。例如，你可以说你使用的是世俗科学的原理，但你的法术仍然会被（%1%）所否定。找到创造性的方法来解释你的角色的技术如何与游戏规则互动。也许你的一些理论是完全错误的；虽然你相信你是通过与神灵对话或使用Thelanian逻辑来产生魔法效果的，但你有可能偶然发现了一种不同的方法来触发传统的奥术反应。如果你想探索基于你的不寻常技术的机械优势和限制，请与你的管理员讨论。",
	"When you cast an artificer spell, you follow the same rules as other spellcasters—but what are you {@i doing} when you use your action to produce a magical effect? You aren't praying for divine intervention, invoking a supernatural patron, or producing a fireball with words and gestures. To cast spells, you must be holding a tool you're proficient with—why? Because you're using that tool and its associated skills to produce magical effects. If you're using alchemist's supplies to cast {@spell cure wounds}, you aren't just poking someone with a beaker; you're mixing a healing salve.": "当你施展工匠法术时，你遵循与其他施法者相同的规则--但当你用你的行动产生魔法效果时，你是什么（%0%）？你不是在祈祷神灵的干预，召唤超自然的守护者，或者用语言和手势产生一个火球。要施展法术，你必须拿着一个你精通的工具--为什么？因为你要使用那个工具及其相关技能来产生魔法效果。如果你使用炼金术士的用品来施展（%1%），你不仅仅是在用烧杯戳人；你是在混合治疗药水。",
	"Think about what your tools actually are. Artisan's tools are an abstract concept—10 pounds of assorted objects and supplies, not just a singular tool. You may have a satchel holding them or a bandolier of pouches. If you use {@item tinker's tools|PHB} to create an effect, what specific tools are you using, and how? Some of the most common tools of artifice are discussed below, but you can cast spells using any artisan's tool you're familiar with. You could even perform your alchemy using {@item brewer's supplies|PHB} or {@item cook's utensils|PHB}; why drink a potion when you could eat a magical pie?": "想一想你的工具究竟是什么。工匠的工具是一个抽象的概念--10磅重的各种物品和用品，而不只是一个单一的工具。你可能有一个装着它们的挎包或一个带状的小包。如果你使用（%0%）来创造一个效果，你使用什么具体的工具，以及如何使用？下面将讨论一些最常见的工匠工具，但你可以使用任何你熟悉的工匠工具来施法。你甚至可以用{@item brewer's supplies|PHB}或{@item cook's utensils|PHB}来执行你的炼金术；当你可以吃一个神奇的馅饼时，为什么要喝药水？",
	"The challenge of creating an alchemical potion is in suspending the mystical chemical reaction for later consumption. It's much easier to trigger an instant effect, and that's what you're doing when you cast your spells. Your {@spell fire bolt} could be a thrown flask, {@spell poison spray} is flinging foul substances. {@spell Cure wounds}, {@spell false life}, and {@spell water breathing} could be potions you mix and serve on the spot. {@spell Disguise self} or {@spell alter self} could be magical cosmetics.": "制造炼金术药水的挑战在于暂停神秘的化学反应，以便以后服用。触发即时效果要容易得多，而这正是你施法时要做的。你的{@spell fire bolt}可能是抛出的酒壶，{@spell poison spray}是抛出的污秽物质。{@spell Cure wounds}、{@spell false life}和{@spell water breathing}可能是你当场混合并提供的药水。{@spell Disguise self}或{@spell alter self}可能是神奇的化妆品。",
	"Sigilry channels arcane power through symbols and sound, using special inks and techniques. As with alchemy, it's much easier to produce an instant effect than to suspend and sustain it as a scroll. When you cast {@spell fire bolt}, perhaps you use your quill to trace the name of fire in the air before you; or you might have the sigil written down and you just read it to produce the effect. Whether you draw sigils onto things or craft simple scrolls and read them, your pen is mightier than most swords.": "Sigilry通过符号和声音引导奥术力量，使用特殊的墨水和技术。就像炼金术一样，产生一个即时效果要比把它作为一个卷轴来悬挂和维持要容易得多。当你施展（%0%）时，也许你用你的羽毛笔在你面前的空气中描画出火的名字；或者你可能已经写下了符号，你只要读出它就能产生效果。无论你是在东西上画符咒，还是制作简单的卷轴并阅读它们，你的笔都比大多数剑更有力量。",
	"This is a twist on the sigilist, and you could use your tools in the same way, drawing arcane glyphs. Or, more exotically, you could specialize in calculating ley lines and the relationships between the planes. The world is filled with micro-manifest zones waiting to be triggered; you're using your tools to calculate the proper alignments to channel the planar energies you need.": "这是对符咒师的一种转折，你可以用同样的方式使用你的工具，画出神秘的字形。或者，更奇特的是，你可以专门计算雷线和各平面之间的关系。这个世界充满了等待触发的微观显现区；你用你的工具来计算适当的排列以引导你需要的平面能量。",
	"If you want to be fanciful about it, you could paint what you need into reality. When you cure wounds, you're literally painting over the injury; when you cast {@spell fire bolt}, you paint the flame in the air and it flies toward your opponent. This is a variation of sigilry, but the same underlying principles apply. You might even create scrolls that are images rather than words.": "如果你想胡思乱想，你可以把你需要的东西画成现实。当你治疗伤口时，你实际上是在伤处涂抹；当你施放（%0%）时，你在空中涂抹火焰，它飞向你的对手。这是圣痕术的一种变体，但同样的基本原则也适用。你甚至可以创建图像而非文字的卷轴。",
	"Artificers are proficient with both thieves' tools and tinker's tools, and you use them in similar ways. Thieves' tools include picks and other fine manipulators. You don't cast a {@spell fire bolt} by pointing a lockpick at someone; but you could use it to clear a problematic valve on a dragon-pistol you made with tinker's tools.": "工匠精通盗贼的工具和工匠的工具，你们使用它们的方式也类似。盗贼的工具包括镐和其他精细的操纵器。你不能用锁匙指着别人来施放（%0%）；但你可以用它来清除你用工匠工具制造的龙枪上有问题的阀门。",
	"You can justify all manner of odd gadgets with tinker's tools, putting together a prototype that becomes part of your toolkit. A dragon-shaped sidearm could produce {@spell fire bolt} or a modified gauntlet could deliver {@spell shocking grasp}. These unstable prototypes can't be used by anyone else, needing constant tinkering to keep them working. So you always carry your tools, and to cast a spell, a \"tool\" must be in hand—but it can be a dragon-gun, as opposed to pliers. You might cast {@spell cure wounds} using a tiny metal spider you've tinkered; while it looks like a mundane clockwork construct, magic lets it move and think. Mundane engineering is part of a tinker's creations, but magic makes them work.": "你可以用工匠的工具来证明各种古怪的小玩意，把一个原型放在一起，成为你工具包的一部分。一个龙形挎包可以产生（%0%），或者一个改良的铠甲可以提供（%1%）。这些不稳定的原型不能被其他人使用，需要不断修补以保持它们的工作。所以你总是带着你的工具，为了施法，必须有一个 \"工具 \"在手--但它可以是一把龙枪，而不是钳子。你可能会用你修补过的一只小金属蜘蛛来施展（2%）；虽然它看起来像一个世俗的发条结构，但魔法让它移动和思考。世俗的工程是工匠创作的一部分，但魔法使它们发挥作用。",
	"Wands, staffs, and rods are some of the most basic forms of arcane focus. If you perform magic with woodcarver's tools, you aren't actually blasting someone with a saw. Instead, you are using experimental, exotic, or temporary wands or rods. As with tinker's tools, you have to have a tool in your hand and you have to possess woodcarver's tools to perform your magic, but the exact nature of which tool is in your hand is up to you. It could appear to be a traditional wand, or you could have come up with a new revolutionary form of wand, staff, or rod.": "魔杖、法杖和棒子是一些最基本的奥术专注形式。如果你用木匠的工具施展魔法，你并不是真的用锯子轰击别人。相反，你使用的是实验性的、异国的或临时的魔杖或魔棒。和工匠的工具一样，你手中必须有一个工具，你必须拥有木匠的工具才能施展你的魔法，但你手中的工具的确切性质由你决定。它可能看起来是一根传统的魔杖，也可能是你想出了一种新的革命性的魔杖、法杖或棍子的形式。",
	"As an artificer, you prepare spells during a long rest, but it's not like a wizard reading a book. It's about assembling the specialized supplies and tools you need for the things you want to do. A sigilist can't create a scroll with just any ink, but has entirely different inks based on the type of effects they're going to produce. Likewise, an alchemist prepares special reagents that combine to produce spell effects. If you use tinker's tools, you're creating and fine-tuning your gadgets. You can't create a dragon-pistol in six seconds; you prepare the pistol during your rest, and when you cast a spell, you're simply loading enchanted ammunition or triggering the arcane sigils you set in place.": "作为一个工匠，你在长时间的休息中准备法术，但这并不像巫师读一本书。它是关于为你想做的事情组装你所需要的专门用品和工具。一个符咒师不能用任何墨水来制作卷轴，而是根据他们要产生的效果类型，拥有完全不同的墨水。同样地，炼金术士准备特殊的试剂，结合起来产生法术效果。如果你使用工匠的工具，你就在创造和微调你的小玩意。你不可能在六秒钟内创造出一把龙枪；你在休息时准备好手枪，而当你施法时，你只是在装入附魔的弹药或触发你设置的奥术符号。",
	"This also explains the idea of spell slots. The reagents you've prepared are tricky to produce and don't last forever. You're preparing as much as you can, but once you go through all your mystic inks, you can't produce another scroll effect until you have a few hours to work on it. Effectively, your spells use temporary magic items that only you can use, created during a long rest.": "这也解释了法术槽的概念。你准备的试剂生产起来很棘手，而且不会永远存在。你尽可能多地准备，但一旦你用完了所有的神秘墨水，你就无法产生另一个卷轴效果，直到你有几个小时的时间来研究它。实际上，你的法术使用的是只有你才能使用的临时魔法物品，是在长时间休息时产生的。",
	"Meanwhile, infusions allow you to create longer-lasting tools that you can share with your companions. Artificers create magic items, but to maintain class balance, you can't flood the party with them; it's up to you what you do with this limited resource.": "同时，灌注允许你创造更持久的工具，并与你的同伴分享。工匠创造了魔法物品，但为了保持等级平衡，你不能让它们充斥整个队伍；如何利用这一有限的资源取决于你。",
	"Artillerists produce eldritch cannons and arcane firearms. Battle Smiths make steel defenders. Any artificer can craft a homunculus companion. But what are these? Are Artillerists wielding guns like those of our own world? Not necessarily.": "炮手生产长生火炮和奥术火器。战斗技师制造钢铁防御者。任何工匠都可以制作一个同体人伴侣。但这些是什么？炮手们挥舞的枪支和我们自己的世界一样吗？不一定。",
	"These items are \"arcane\" and \"eldritch.\" Much as the primary form of arcane artillery is the {@item siege staff|ExploringEberron}, the Artillerist uses woodcarver's tools, turning \"a rod, staff, or wand into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.\" So you're a specialized wandslinger with improved wands, staffs, and rods. You choose their appearance—a wand, a specialized hand crossbow, a flintlock pistol, a tiny metal dragon, or any aesthetic you like. \"Arcane firearm\" doesn't necessarily mean \"handgun.\"": "这些物品是 \"奥术的 \"和 \"长生的\"。就像奥术火炮的主要形式是{@item siege staff|ExploringEberron}一样，炮手使用木雕工具，将 \"棒子、法杖或魔杖变成奥术火器，成为你破坏性法术的管道。\" 所以你是一个专门的巫师，拥有改良的魔杖、法杖和棒子。你可以选择它们的外观--一根魔杖、一把专门的手弩、一把燧发枪、一条小金属龙，或者任何你喜欢的审美。\"奥术火器 \"并不一定意味着 \"手枪\"。",
	"While the name \"eldritch cannon\" sounds like a massive piece of artillery, an eldritch cannon is either small or tiny, possibly small enough to hold in your hand. What does it look like, and does it have legs? Is it an animated ballista? A small siege staff? A tiny brass dragon that breathes fire on your enemies?": "虽然 \"长生大炮 \"这个名字听起来像是一件巨大的火炮，但长生大炮要么很小，要么很小，可能小到可以拿在手里。它是什么样子的，它有腿吗？它是动画弹弓吗？一个小型攻城杖？一条对敌人喷火的小铜龙？",
	"The same principle applies to a homunculi's appearance. Consider your style and the tools that you use for your magic. Your homunculus servant can deliver your touch spells, but how? If you use painter's supplies to perform your magic, your homunculus could be a tiny humanoid paintbrush, a floating palette, or even a creature made out of living paint. An alchemist's homunculus could be a tiny cauldron or a little humanoid creature made from glass and beakers.": "同样的原则也适用于同体人的外观。考虑到你的风格和你用来施展魔法的工具。你的同体人仆人可以传递你的触摸法术，但如何传递？如果你使用画家的用品来施展你的魔法，你的同体人可以是一个小小的人形画笔，一个漂浮的调色板，甚至是一个由活的颜料制成的生物。炼金术士的同形体可以是一个小小的大锅，或者一个由玻璃和烧杯制成的小人形生物。",
	"Through all of these, the mechanics don't change. The shape of your arcane firearm makes no difference in combat rules; what it changes is the story that you're telling. What's interesting about your artificer? What does your homunculus say about you?": "通过所有这些，机制并没有改变。你的奥术火器的形状在战斗规则中没有区别；它所改变的是你所讲述的故事。你的工匠有什么有趣的地方？你的同体人对你有什么说法？",
	"You've developed your style and chosen your tools. But how and where did you develop your skills? Do you have a connection to an established order of artificers? Consider these ways your background could reflect your experience as an artificer.": "你已经形成了自己的风格，选择了自己的工具。但你是如何以及在哪里发展你的技能的？你是否与某个既定的工匠组织有联系？考虑一下你的背景可以反映你作为工匠的经验。",
	"You worked your way up in House Cannith or the Arcane Congress, studying at a trade school and working in an industrial forgehold. While you've abandoned the factory in favor of adventure, you still have strong ties in the Fabricator's Guild.": "你在坎尼斯家族或奥术大会中一路走来，在贸易学校学习，在工业锻造厂工作。虽然你已经放弃了工厂而选择了冒险，但你在制造者公会仍有很强的联系。",
	"You operated and maintained the engines of war. What nation did you serve? Are you proud of your service, or haunted by your deeds? Did you serve and retire with distinction—or are you a folk hero who deserted to help innocents?": "你们操作和维护战争的引擎。你为哪个国家服务？你是为你的服务感到骄傲，还是为你的事迹感到困扰？你是否服役并出色地退役，或者你是为帮助无辜者而开小差的民间英雄？",
	"You don't do well with authority. You may have started with Arcanix or the Twelve, but you were thrown out after challenging the system one too many times. You're brilliant—but determined to find your own path.": "你不善于与权威打交道。你可能已经开始在Arcanix或12人组织工作，但你在挑战系统太多次后被赶了出来。你很聪明，但决心要找到自己的道路。",
	"You've never studied arcane science, but you have an intuitive talent for artifice. Perhaps you grew up on battlefields, scavenging parts from warforged titans or shattered floating fortresses. Your work isn't pretty—and often seems like it {@i shouldn't} work—yet you can do things no magewright can match.": "你从未学习过神秘的科学，但你对制造有一种直觉上的天赋。也许你是在战场上长大的，从被战争锻造的泰坦巨人或破碎的浮动堡垒上搜刮零件。你的工作并不漂亮，而且经常看起来像（%0%）工作，但你能做到任何魔法师都无法比拟的事情。",
	"You provided arcane assistance to an organization operating out of the public eye. Did you serve with the Royal Eyes of Aundair or the King's Citadel of Breland, crafting common items for agents? Or was it a shadier operation like the Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan? Why did you shift to a life of adventure? What pieces of your old life could come back to haunt you?": "你为一个在公众视野之外运作的组织提供了奥术援助。你是否为昂代尔的皇家之眼或布雷兰德的国王城堡服务，为代理人制作普通物品？还是像博洛玛家族或塔卡南家族那样的阴暗行动？你为什么会转向冒险生活？你以前的生活中有哪些片段会回来纠缠你？",
	"If you're a guild artisan, what guild did you work with? When you buy a {@item wand of magic missiles} in Sharn, who made it?

	"Throughout the golden age of Galifar, the Arcane Congress delved into magical mysteries for the good of all. Today, it only serves the people of Aundair, yet remains the largest institute of both wizardry and artifice outside of House Cannith. The Arcane Congress was largely devoted to the war effort, but it has also continued to develop common magic items and other magical tools to improve the daily life of people in Aundair.": "在整个加利法尔的黄金时代，奥术大会为了所有人的利益而深入研究魔法的奥秘。今天，它只为昂代尔的人民服务，但仍然是坎尼斯家族之外最大的巫术和人工制品研究所。奥术大会主要致力于战争，但它也继续开发普通魔法物品和其他魔法工具，以改善昂代尔人的日常生活。",

	"House Cannith is the single largest source of artifice in the Five Nations, providing training through its trade schools and employing magewrights and artificers in its factories and forgeholds. The Fabricator's Guild creates both magical and mundane goods, while the loosely organized Tinker's Guild focuses on maintenance and repair. While Cannith has a broad range of expertise, Cannith West in Aundair excels at alchemy, Cannith South in Breland has the edge in general industry, and Cannith East specializes in artillery and dabbles in necromancy.": "坎尼斯家族是五国中最大的人工制品来源，通过其贸易学校提供培训，并在其工厂和锻造厂雇佣魔法师和工匠。制造者行会创造魔法和世俗的物品，而组织松散的修补者行会则专注于维护和修理。虽然坎尼斯拥有广泛的专业知识，但位于昂代尔的西坎尼斯擅长炼金术，位于布雷兰的南坎尼斯在一般工业方面具有优势，而东坎尼斯则专门从事火炮并涉足死灵法术。",

	"Every nation employed enhanced and arcane artillery in the war, along with battle magic. While most relied heavily on House Cannith, every nation has its own program researching military applications of magic, along with a corps of magewrights trained to operate artillery.

	"In a parallel to the cults of the Traveler, this secret order of magewrights and artificers believe they're directly inspired by the Sovereign Onatar. Members can be found scattered throughout the other organizations in this section. Onatar's Chosen believe that artifice should serve the greater good, and they seek to drive their organizations toward such positive purposes.": "与旅行者的邪教平行，这个由魔法师和工匠组成的秘密组织相信他们直接受到奥纳塔君主的启发。成员可以在本节的其他组织中找到。奥纳塔的神选者相信，工匠应该为更大的利益服务，他们试图推动他们的组织朝着这样的积极目的前进。",

	"These cults are a dark reflection of Onatar's Chosen. Followers of the Traveler are found in most organizations in this section, with a strong presence in House Cannith. Traveler cultists pursue innovation at all costs, creating weapons or tools that could shatter the existing balance of power or cause chaos in other ways. Some outsiders believe airships (which cause strife between Orien and Lyrandar) and warforged may been created by these cultists—and many blame the Traveler for the Mourning.": "这些邪教是奥纳塔的神选者的黑暗反映。旅行者的追随者在这部分的大多数组织中都能找到，在坎尼斯家族中的存在感很强。旅行者崇拜者不惜一切代价追求创新，创造出可以打破现有权力平衡的武器或工具，或以其他方式造成混乱。一些外人认为飞艇（导致奥瑞恩和利兰达之间的纷争）和战争锻造者可能是由这些邪教徒创造的--许多人将哀悼归咎于旅行者。",

	"Changelings are spread across Khorvaire and Sarlona. They can interbreed with many other humanoid species, and the offspring of such a union will either be changeling or the other species—there are no \"half-changelings.\" So just as you can be a Brelish elf with no ties to Aerenal, you can be a changeling with no connection to any changeling culture or community. There are changeling students in Arcanix and Morgrave, changeling agents in the King's Citadel and the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and any number of changelings devoted to the nations they call home. So you don't {@i need} deep cultural ties to play a changeling character, but if you want to explore a connection to your changeling roots, here are a few ideas.": "变种人分布在霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳。他们可以与许多其他类人物种杂交，这种结合的后代要么是变种人，要么是其他物种，没有 \"半变种人\"。因此，正如你可以成为一个与Aerenal没有关系的Brelish精灵，你也可以成为一个与任何changeling文化或社区没有关系的changeling。在阿卡尼克斯和莫格雷夫有变种人学生，在国王城堡和阿恩代尔的皇家之眼有变种人特工，还有任何数量的变种人致力于他们称之为家园的国家。所以你不{@i need}有很深的文化联系来扮演一个变种人角色，但如果你想探索与你的变种人根的联系，这里有几个想法。",
	"Nomadic changelings are often referred to as \"travelers,\" a name referencing both to their wandering lifestyle as well as the Traveler of the Dark Six—who, legend holds, gave them the ability to change their form, and whose chaotic nature is echoed in the lives of many travelers today.": "游牧的变身者通常被称为 \"旅行者\"，这个名字既指他们的流浪生活方式，也指黑暗六人组的旅行者--传说是他给了他们改变形态的能力，而他的混乱本质在今天许多旅行者的生活中得到了回应。",
	"The oldest traveler tradition is that of the Children of Jes. Inspired by the Traveler, the Children follow migratory patterns that slowly evolve, keeping them from becoming too predictable to outsiders. Many travel in small groups—a troupe of entertainers, a merchant convoy, a stagecoach of exotic travelers. Others prefer to travel alone. Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.": "最古老的旅行者传统是杰斯之子的传统。受旅行者的启发，孩子们遵循缓慢发展的迁徙模式，使他们不至于对外人来说变得太容易预测。许多人以小团体的形式旅行--艺人的剧团、商人的车队、异国旅行者的马车。其他人则喜欢独自旅行。无论怎样，他们相信变化的重要性，在他们的流浪过程中扮演着许多角色。工匠、吟游诗人、信使和牧师是常见的角色，而变种人很可能在他们的行业中相当有天赋。旅行者牧师可以在早上向主人布道，在晚上带领火焰之歌。由于隐藏了他们真正的变种人本性，孩子们通常对他们周围的人来说是看不见的；他们使用一种秘密的纹身和伤疤语言来识别彼此，同时还有一套共同的角色。",
	"Few people in the Five Nations understand the culture and values held by changeling travelers. Some are unnerved by the concept of a hidden culture, that a stranger might not be the human or hobgoblin they appear to be. Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to \"obtain\" another's possessions as long as they're replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler's blessing is their license to prey on the \"single-skins\"—a term for races lacking the changeling gift for shapeshifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people—whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid—though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shapeshifting abilities and nomadic preferences.": "五国中很少有人理解变种人的文化和价值观。有些人对隐秘文化的概念感到不安，认为陌生人可能不是他们表面上的人类或妖精。其他人则认为，由于变种人拥有随意改变面孔的不可思议的能力，他们会利用这种能力达到邪恶的目的，在继续前进之前欺骗诚实的人。变形人的传统早于加利法尔和它的法律，事实上，有些人认为 \"获得 \"他人的财产是公平的，只要用同等价值的礼物来代替。一些旅行者声称，旅行者的祝福是他们掠夺 \"单皮 \"的许可--这是一个对缺乏变身天赋的种族的称呼。然而，旅行者并不比任何其他人更天生不诚实--无论是龙纹继承人还是守门人德鲁伊--尽管那些尊重当地习俗的人仍然会因为他们的变身能力和游牧偏好而受到很多怀疑。",
	"As a player character, the changeling traveler background presented in chapter 6 can allow you to be part of a secretive network of changelings spread across the nation. As a DM, you could present the Children as a stereotypical source of thieves and charlatans. But they could be more enigmatic—an unexpected ally that can appear almost anywhere.": "作为一个玩家角色，第6章中介绍的变种人旅行者背景可以让你成为遍布全国的变种人秘密网络的一部分。作为管理人，你可以将变异人呈现为盗贼和骗子的典型来源。但他们也可以更加神秘--一个几乎可以出现在任何地方的意外盟友。",
	"Under the rule of Galifar, many changelings chose to emerge from the shadows and live in the open, and today they can be found in most major cities of the Five Nations. Changelings in stable communities—such as Dragoneyes in Sharn or the Blackleaf district of Wroat—rarely hide their true nature. This allows them to sell their services openly and to pursue careers that make use of their unique talents, as explored in the \"Changeling Careers\" sidebar. However, many still make use of shared personas, and outsiders can be confused by the changelings' fluid relationship with identity. Settled changelings don't face the same level of prejudice as travelers, but there are still many single-skins who believe no changeling can be trusted.": "在加利法尔的统治下，许多变种人选择从阴影中走出来，生活在公开场合，如今他们可以在五国的大多数主要城市找到。稳定社区中的变种人--如沙恩的龙眼（Dragoneyes）或沃洛特的黑叶区--很少隐藏他们的真实本性。这使他们能够公开出售自己的服务，并从事能够利用其独特才能的职业，正如 \"变种人职业 \"侧栏中所探讨的那样。然而，许多人仍在使用共同的角色，外人可能会被变种人与身份的流动关系所迷惑。定居的变种人不会像旅行者那样面临同样程度的偏见，但仍有许多单皮人认为没有变种人可以信任。",
	"In addition to changeling neighborhoods in the cities of the Five Nations, there are two unique changeling cultures. The Gray Tide principality of the Lhazaar Principalities is a nation of changelings with a strong mercantile tradition; some say that the Gray Tide engages in a great deal of piracy, using their shapeshifting gifts to shift the blame to other princes. In Droaam, changelings are said to have a stronghold in the city of Lost. However, no outsider knows the location of Lost, and it's said that the city itself is alive, and can freely move and change its shape. Regardless, the changelings of Lost have been strong allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell, and changelings can be found serving Daask.": "除了五国城市中的变种人社区外，还有两种独特的变种人文化。拉扎尔公国的灰潮公国是一个拥有强大商业传统的变种人国家；有人说灰潮公国从事大量的海盗活动，利用他们的变身天赋将责任推给其他公国。在德罗阿姆，据说变革者在迷失之城有一个据点。然而，没有外人知道失落城的位置，据说这座城市本身是有生命的，可以自由移动和改变形状。不管怎么说，迷失之城的变化者一直是索拉-凯尔之女的强大盟友，而且可以发现变化者为达斯克服务。",
	"As a player character, a stable background gives you a place to call home and allows you to be open about your true nature. As a DM, a changeling community can be an interesting backdrop for an adventure or an easy place to find changeling services.": "作为一个玩家角色，一个稳定的背景给了你一个可以称之为家的地方，让你可以公开你的真实本性。作为DM，一个变种人社区可以成为一个有趣的冒险背景，或者一个容易找到变种人服务的地方。",
	"People often think of the shapeshifting talents of the changeling as a tool for deception. But in places where changelings live openly, including Droaam and the major cities of the Five Nations, there are many practical uses for shapeshifting. Changelings have long dominated the industry of paid companionship, using their talents to fulfill fantasies. While this can be sexual, there are many other changeling companions who specialize in giving a client the opportunity to have a meal or conversation with a distant loved one, or to practice a difficult conversation with a changeling stand-in. Many artists use changelings as versatile models. Changelings can also often be found as beauticians; in addition to possessing a deep understanding of the shifting nature of appearance, a changeling can use their own form as a palette on which to perfect the look a client is aiming for.": "人们通常认为变种人的变身才能是一种欺骗的工具。但在变种人公开生活的地方，包括德拉姆和五国的主要城市，变身有许多实际用途。长期以来，变种人一直主导着有偿陪伴的行业，利用他们的才能来满足人们的幻想。虽然这可以是性方面的，但也有许多其他的变身人伴侣，他们专门给客户提供与远方亲人吃饭或谈话的机会，或与变身人的替身练习困难的谈话。许多艺术家使用变身人作为多功能的模特。变种人也经常被发现是美容师；除了对外观的变化性质有深刻的理解外，变种人还可以用自己的外形作为调色板，在上面完善客户所要的外观。",
	"Impersonation is also a viable career. Do you need to be in two places at once? Do you want a local celebrity to appear at your child's birthday party? Hire a changeling impersonator. The Defender's Guild of House Deneith has recently begun training and licensing elite changeling bodyguards, capable of serving as body doubles or posing as harmless bystanders until needed.": "冒充也是一个可行的职业。你需要同时出现在两个地方吗？你想让当地名人出现在你孩子的生日聚会上吗？雇佣一个变种人的模仿者吧。迪尼斯家族的卫士公会最近开始培训和许可精英变种人保镖，他们能够充当替身，或者在需要时冒充无害的旁观者。",
	"Many changelings pursue a career in entertainment. After all, a changeling with the proper {@item shiftweave|ERLW} outfit can play five roles! However, House Thuranni and House Phiarlan have been accused of denying opportunities to changelings. In licensed Phiarlan companies, changelings are typically relegated to serving as understudies and stunt doubles for dragonmarked superstars.": "许多变种人追求娱乐事业。毕竟，一个拥有适当（%0%）装备的变种人可以扮演五个角色！但是，瑟兰尼家族和菲亚兰家族被指责为剥夺了变种人的机会。然而，瑟兰尼家族和菲亚尔兰家族一直被指责为拒绝给变种人提供机会。在获得许可的Phiarlan公司中，变种人通常被降级为龙纹超级明星的替身和特技替身。",
	"While changelings are well represented in the major cities, there are many villages and towns where they're treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a passer, you've crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You may live your entire life as a human warrior or an elf priest, engaging your shapeshifting abilities only as a last resort.": "虽然变种人在主要城市有很好的代表性，但在许多村庄和城镇，他们受到恐惧和怀疑的对待。你可能出生在这样一个社区，甚至可能从未认识过其他的变种人。作为一个通行者，你已经精心设计了一个单一的身份，你认为这是你的真实面目。你可能一生都在以人类战士或精灵牧师的身份生活，只有在不得已的情况下才使用你的变身能力。",
	"If you grew up as a passer, how do you live today? Do you want to learn more about other changeling cultures, or do you deny any connection to other changelings? Do you acknowledge your changeling nature, or do you consider your passer identity to be your true self?

	"Passer can be an interesting choice for an urchin, outlander, or a changeling who's lived through oppression and is only now coming to understand their true nature.

	"Changelings are as diverse as any other species, presenting many other cultures and paths you could explore. {@i Reality seekers} are settled changelings who prefer their natural form and avoid deception, instead searching for the ultimate truth. {@i Becomers} actively seek to live many lives in order to more fully understand the experiences of others. The Cabinet of Faces is a secret society devoted to the Traveler, and its members actively seek to challenge traditions and cause chaos. Do you have ties to any of these movements?": "变种人和其他物种一样多样化，呈现出许多其他文化和路径，你可以探索。{@i Reality seekers}是定居的变化者，他们喜欢他们的自然形态，避免欺骗，而是寻找最终的真相。{@i Becomers}积极寻求过多种生活，以便更充分地了解他人的经历。面孔内阁是一个致力于旅行者的秘密社团，其成员积极寻求挑战传统并造成混乱。你与这些运动中的任何一个有关系吗？",
	"For a changeling, an identity is like a set of clothes. Within a changeling community, a persona may serve the same role a badge of office or uniform would for a human. The local priest is Father Hes. The sheriff is Big Dol. The healer is Lela. Whoever takes on the job assumes that persona. There may be three different priests, but whoever is currently on duty assumes the identity of Hes. In part, this is visual, but it's also about adopting a personality—not just looking like Father Hes, but {@i becoming} Father Hes, giving the people a sense of continuity.": "对于一个变种人来说，身份就像一套衣服。在一个变种人社区里，一个角色的作用可能与人类的办公徽章或制服的作用相同。当地的牧师是Hes神父。警长是大多尔。治疗师是Lela。不管是谁担任这个工作，都要扮演这个角色。可能有三个不同的牧师，但目前正在值班的人都是Hes的身份。在某种程度上，这是视觉上的，但它也是关于采用一种个性--不仅仅是看起来像赫斯神父，而是（%0%）赫斯神父，给人们一种连续性的感觉。",
	"This is especially important for the traveling clans. Travelers use well-established personas as anchors in potentially hostile communities. A trusted merchant, a beloved storyteller, or a reliable mercenary—any traveler can use one of these established personas to ensure a warm welcome. Of course, when using an established persona, it's up to you to preserve its reputation. If you're exposed as a changeling or if you ruin the reputation of the persona, you're destroying a valuable tool.": "这对旅行者的家族来说尤其重要。旅行者在潜在的敌对社区中使用成熟的角色作为锚。一个值得信赖的商人，一个受人喜爱的说书人，或者一个可靠的雇佣兵--任何旅行者都可以使用这些既定的角色之一来确保受到热烈欢迎。当然，当你使用一个既定的角色时，你应该保护它的声誉。如果你被暴露为变种人，或者你破坏了这个角色的声誉，你就会毁掉一个有价值的工具。",
	"Many changelings develop their own unique personas. If you're a fighter with proficiency in the violin, you might use a grim half-orc form in combat and an elegant elf when you play the violin. You're not required to use a persona—the violinist could fight in their elf form—but the persona can serve as a way to focus on that particular skill. The {@feat Focused Personas|ExploringEberron} feat in chapter 6 provides a concrete reflection of this.": "许多变身者发展出他们自己独特的角色。如果你是一个精通小提琴的战士，你可能在战斗中使用狰狞的半兽人形态，而在拉小提琴时使用优雅的精灵形态。你不需要使用角色--小提琴手可以用他们的精灵形态战斗--但是角色可以作为专注于该特定技能的一种方式。第6章中的{@feat Focused Personas|ExploringEberron}壮举就具体反映了这一点。",
	"You could create a character of any class and background who just happens to be a changeling—or you can create a character whose concept is integrally tied to your identity as a changeling. Chapter 6 presents a changeling traveler background, three racial feats, and a Living Weapon monk subclass that blends shapechanging with martial discipline. However, you can have an equally interesting story with a character of any background or class, instead adjusting the \"fluff\"—the cosmetic details or backstory of a class—to fit an idea.

As an Aereni elf, you aren't expected to {@i improve} your society; your task is to prove yourself worthy of it and to earn your afterlife.": "作为Aereni的一员，你走的路与Khorvaire的人不同。你出生在一个由古老而强大的神灵守护和引导的领域。你从那些几千年前就已经死去的老师那里学到了教训，你知道即使是摆在你面前的几个世纪的生活也只是你灵魂旅程的开始。你们的人民拥有昂代尔无法掌握的奥秘知识；不死阁的祭司们拥有只有火焰守护者才能比拟的力量。你们来自一个充满奇迹的国度，一个由神圣力量引导的领域。简而言之，你们的人民已经达到了完美的境界。作为一个Aereni精灵，你并不被期望{@i improve}你的社会；你的任务是证明自己配得上它，并赢得你的来世。",
	"Aereni elves have a reputation for being arrogant and condescending. Why wouldn't you be? Humans are like children to you, with their short lives and desperation to do things quickly regardless of the quality of their efforts. Even the elves that settled in Khorvaire have abandoned the traditions of their ancestors and their blessed homeland. It's easy to be smug... but who wants that character around? An Aereni elf doesn't have to be unpleasant. As one of the Aereni, you are a traveler from a mysterious and magical kingdom. You possess ancient wisdom and a tie to divine spirits. Beyond that, the Undying Court is one of the few forces in the world that has a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy. Have you come to Khorvaire as an emissary of the Undying Court, whether as a diplomat or an agent of prophecy? Are you working on behalf of a noble family, pursuing mercantile interests, or seeking an artifact stolen from your people long ago? Are you an anthropologist fascinated by the behavior of humanity? Are you a paladin in the service of the Deathguard, charged to exterminate undead wherever they can be found? Or are you an exile, driven from your homeland and forced to live among the barbarians?": "Aereni精灵以傲慢和居高临下而闻名。你为什么不呢？人类对你来说就像孩子，他们生命短暂，不顾一切地快速做事，不顾他们的努力质量。即使是定居在霍尔韦尔的精灵，也放弃了他们祖先的传统和他们受祝福的故乡。自鸣得意很容易......但谁想让这种性格在身边呢？一个Aereni精灵不一定是不讨人喜欢的。作为艾瑞尼人的一员，你是一个来自神秘而神奇的王国的旅行者。你拥有古老的智慧和与神灵的联系。除此之外，不死阁是世界上为数不多的能瞥见德拉贡预言的力量之一。你是作为不死阁的使者来到霍尔韦尔，无论是作为外交官还是预言的代理人？你是代表一个贵族家庭工作，追求商业利益，还是在寻找很久以前从你的人民那里偷走的文物？你是一个对人类行为着迷的人类学家吗？你是一名为死亡守卫服务的圣骑士，负责在任何地方消灭亡灵？或者你是一个流亡者，被赶出你的家园，被迫生活在野蛮人中间？",
	"Whether you play an Aereni character or encounter them as NPCs, this section provides insight into the land of the elves. In addition, chapter 6 presents a feat and subrace for Aereni elves.": "无论你是扮演Aereni角色还是作为NPC遇到他们，本节都提供了对精灵土地的深入了解。此外，第6章介绍了Aereni精灵的特技和亚种族。",
	"Aerenal is an isolated nation with little interest in the outside world. They have little fear of conquest; the divine power of the Undying Court has repelled assaults by legions of dragons. But the power of the Undying Court doesn't extend beyond Aerenal, and the elves have chosen to remain in their haven rather than to expand across the world. From this island sanctuary, they have seen the Empire of Dhakaan rise and fall, and they expect to be around long after the Five Nations have fallen to dust. Here are a few more important things to know about Aerenal.": "Aerenal是一个与世隔绝的国家，对外部世界没有什么兴趣。他们几乎不惧怕征服；不死阁的神圣力量已经击退了龙族军团的进攻。但是，不死阁的力量并没有延伸到艾瑞纳之外，精灵们选择留在他们的避难所，而不是向全世界扩张。从这个岛屿上的避难所，他们见证了达卡安帝国的兴衰，他们期望在五国沦为尘埃之后还能长期存在。以下是关于Aerenal的一些更重要的事情。",
	"Aerenal is ruled by the living. The Sibling Kings lead the nation from Shae Cairdal, and the high priests and lords of the lines are mortal elves. But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to {@i spirit idols}, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These sprits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.": "Aerenal是由活人统治的。兄弟姐妹国王从沙伊-凯尔达尔领导这个国家，大祭司和各系领主是凡人精灵。但死者引导并保护着生者。当杰出的精灵死亡时，他们会被保存到死后。大多数人被绑在{@i spirit idols}，保存灵魂的雕像上，并防止其在Dolurrh解体。但也有一些人被养成了无死之身，类似于木乃伊的亡灵，但由正能量维持。没有死亡的士兵守卫着地下墓穴和神庙，没有死亡的圣人和顾问与他们的后代分享他们的知识和智慧。随着时间的推移，没有死亡的人可以上升到一个更伟大的境界，成为几乎不需要身体的纯粹精神的生命。这些被称为 \"升天议员 \"的精灵居住在伟大的城市Shae Mordai，当他们的精神在一个神秘的格式中结合在一起时，他们就会拥有神圣的力量。",
	"Many outsiders assume that the ascendant councilors are the Undying Court, and it's true they are the source of its power. But the Undying Court refers to {@i all} the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the {@i spirit idols}. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor—this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years—but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.": "许多外人认为，长老会成员就是不死阁，他们确实是不死阁的权力来源。但不死阁指的是（%0%）岛上的不死守护者，从士兵到（%1%）。你可能不会期望成为一个长老级的理事--这是一个通常需要数千年的进化过程--但你可以渴望在死后加入不死阁。",
	"As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones—such as the one in Shae Mordai—but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn't rely on faith; there's no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people—from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive.": "作为一个艾瑞尼人，你对自己对不死之庭的责任有着敏锐的认识。不死之身是靠正能量维持的；这可以从伊里安的显化区--比如Shae Mordai的显化区--汲取，但也可以通过爱和奉献产生。与Eberron的许多宗教不同，不死之庭并不依赖信仰；不存在不死之庭是否存在的问题。但它确实依赖于奉献。你的祈祷和你的信仰是你为法庭为你和你的人民所做的一切提供的交换条件--从保护你的土地不受入侵、瘟疫和自然灾害的影响，到指导你的领导人和训练你的年轻人。你们的祖先保护你们，但他们也需要你们的奉献来生存。",
	"The deathless state isn't the only way to experience eternity. Most honored dead of Aerenal are preserved in spirit idols that preserve the soul from the dissolution of Dolurrh. This stone bust of a dead elf holds relics of their corpse (bone shards, a lock of hair) embedded within it. While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance—a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A {@i spirit idol} can be awakened with the {@spell speak with dead} spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.": "无死亡状态并不是体验永恒的唯一途径。艾瑞纳的大多数尊贵的死者都被保存在精神偶像中，使灵魂免受多鲁尔的溶解。这个死去的精灵的半身石像内嵌有他们尸体的遗物（骨头碎片、一绺头发）。在休眠状态下，神像内的灵魂不知道外界或时间的流逝，存在于一种持续的恍惚中--一种由记忆和个人经历建立的梦境般的存在。一个{@i spirit idol}的神像可以通过{@spell speak with dead}的咒语被唤醒，尽管有些神像会无限期地保持意识，并且可以被发现担任导师、教务长和法官。",
	"Not all Aereni want to become deathless—many consider the {@i spirit idol} the superior state. The deathless are sworn to protect and serve the living, and must deal with the ongoing inconvenience of physical existence; within a {@i spirit idol}, an elf can experience eternal peace in a dream of their own making. For many Aereni, their greatest goal in life is to gather the memories and ideas that will be their companions in their eternal trance after death.": "并非所有艾瑞尼人都想成为无死之人--许多人认为{@i spirit idol}的状态更优越。没有死亡的人发誓要保护和服务于活着的人，并且必须处理身体存在的持续不便；在{@i spirit idol}的范围内，精灵可以在他们自己制造的梦境中体验永恒的和平。对许多Aereni来说，他们一生中最大的目标是收集记忆和想法，这些记忆和想法将成为他们死后永恒的恍惚中的伙伴。",
	"While there are more {@i spirit idols} than there are deathless, not all dead are preserved this way. {@i Spirit idols} are reserved for those who have proven worthy of eternal existence. The common dead are embalmed after death and interred in the vast catacombs below the land, along with a record of their life. Only those who have committed truly heinous crimes—such as grave robbers—are denied memory; such criminals are burned after death, their ashes scattered in the oceans, with no records kept of their lives.": "虽然{@i spirit idols}比没有死亡的人多，但并不是所有的死者都是这样被保存的。{@i Spirit idols}是留给那些已经证明值得永恒存在的人。普通死者死后被防腐处理，连同他们的生活记录一起被埋在土地下面的巨大地下墓穴中。只有那些犯下真正令人发指的罪行的人--如盗墓者--才会被剥夺记忆；这样的罪犯在死后被烧死，他们的骨灰散落在海洋中，没有关于他们生活的记录。",
	"Both arcane and divine magic are woven into Aereni civilization more deeply than in the Five Nations. Every citizen of Aerenal knows at least one useful cantrip; the skills of a master magewright in Khorvaire would be considered a mere apprentice's training in Aerenal. Here, spell effects of up to 5th level can be found woven into the fabric of everyday life. {@spell teleportation circle||Teleportation circles} link Aerenal's great cities, and {@i {@spell sending} stations} allow instant communication across any distance. Buildings are raised using the principles of {@spell stone shape}. Diviners communicate with other planes, and healers can break curses and reverse petrification. Spell effects of up to 7th level can be encountered in the hands of master wizards and high priests, and Aereni artificers can craft very rare magic items. As you explore Khorvaire and the lands beyond, bear in mind that in your Aereni eyes, it's little more than a primitive backwater.": "与五国相比，奥术和神术在Aereni文明中的交织程度更深。每个艾瑞纳的公民都至少知道一种有用的咒语；在霍尔韦尔，魔法大师的技能在艾瑞纳仅仅被认为是学徒的训练。在这里，5级以下的法术效果可以在日常生活的结构中找到交织。{@spell teleportation circle||Teleportation circles}连接着Aerenal的大城市，{@i {@spell sending}站}可以跨越任何距离进行即时通信。建筑物是利用（%2%）的原理升起的。占卜者可以与其他位面沟通，治疗者可以打破诅咒并扭转石化现象。大师级的巫师和大祭司手中可以遇到高达7级的法术效果，Aereni工匠可以制作非常罕见的魔法物品。当你探索霍尔韦尔和其他土地时，请记住，在你的Aereni眼中，它只不过是一个原始的落后地区。",
	"At a glance, the people of Aerenal are simply better at everything than their counterparts in Khorvaire, due to their exceptional work ethic and long lifespan. An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren't trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan's goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters—and in Aerenal, they're still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it's a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You've never been encouraged to innovate; you've been taught that {@i the old ways are the best ways}. Do you agree with this?": "一眼望去，艾瑞纳人在任何方面都比霍尔韦尔的同行要强，这是因为他们有特殊的职业道德和长寿命。一个Aereni工匠可以用多个人类的寿命来完善他们的工艺。即使是在恍惚的时候，一个精灵也可能在思考他们的工作。然而，在工业和创新方面，Aerenal落后于Khorvaire。艾瑞尼人并不试图找到更好的方法来做事情；精灵工匠的目标是与过去的大师的技能相匹配，而不是找到新的技术。挑战过去是对那些古老大师的侮辱--在Aerenal，他们仍然存在，仍然在传授他们的技术。一个Aereni工匠可以制造出非常罕见的魔法物品，这是Cannith锻造厂无法比拟的，但这是一件需要多年才能完成的手工艺术品，而Cannith锻造厂正在生产大量的普通和不普通的物品，并不断寻找创新的方法。今天的五国可能无法与Aerenal相提并论，但在过去的一千年中，五国已经发生了巨大的变化，而Aerenal却停滞不前。你从来没有被鼓励去创新，你一直被教导说（%0%）。你同意这一点吗？",
	"Aerenal is effectively a collection of city-states, united in devotion to the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court. Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, \"the line of Mendyrian\" refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname—such as Belaereth Mendyrian—is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it's not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings—the rulers of the united kingdom—are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren't blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.": "Aerenal实际上是一个城邦的集合体，在对兄弟姐妹国王和不朽的法庭的奉献中团结起来。这个国家的每个地区（除了泰尔纳达尔的北部领土）都由一个贵族家族管理。艾伦纳尔的原始定居者来自不同的文化和环境，各系代表了这一点；虽然所有的人都被艾伦纳尔的共同习俗所团结，但每个系都有自己独特的时尚和传统。一个家族是一个古老家族的联盟，由一个带有该家族名称的贵族家族管理。因此，\"门迪里安家族 \"指的是多个家族，但使用该姓氏的人--如贝拉里思-门迪里安--是贵族家族的成员。贵族血统代表了该地区的精英；它不是一个世袭家族，而是一个任人唯贤的组织，其成员从该地区的人民中选出。同样，兄弟姐妹国王--联合王国的统治者--也是同一家族的成员，象征性地是兄弟姐妹，但他们不是血亲。因此，在生活中，精灵们渴望被任命为他们的贵族系列；在死亡时，他们希望被提升到不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating an Aereni elf, work with your DM to develop details about your family and the line you owe allegiance to. Since each line is an alliance of multiple families, there's room for you to add your own details even within an existing line.

	"The line of Jhaelian governs the region around Taer Kalindal. Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the Undying Court and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many monks, clerics, and paladins, as well as many members of the Deathguard—the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down Mabaran undead. Members of this line have a tradition of using cosmetic transmutation to adopt a desiccated appearance—not unlike that of the deathless themselves—though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.": "Jhaelian家族管辖着Taer Kalindal周围的地区。Jhaelian有强大的精神传统；它的成员深深地致力于不朽的法庭和对神圣奥秘的沉思。这个系列产生了许多僧侣、牧师和圣骑士，以及许多死亡守卫的成员--致力于猎杀马巴兰亡灵的Aereni机构。这个系列的成员有一个传统，就是使用化妆术来采用干燥的外观--与无死亡者本身的外观并不一样--尽管其他Jhaelian Aereni喜欢戴面具。",
	"Governors of the region surrounding Pylas Talaear, the line of Melideth produces the finest sailors of Aerenal and maintains the Aereni navy.

	"The line of Mendyrian governs the region around Shae Cairdal, and for most of Aerenal's history they have also been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings. The Mendyrian Aereni are devoted to arcane lore, and many of the most gifted wizards and artificers are Mendyrian. The Mendyrian Aereni take particular pride in their appearance, favoring ornate patterns and decoration in clothing, elaborate hairstyles, and masks of metal or leather.": "门迪里安一系统治着沙伊-凯尔达尔周围的地区，在艾瑞纳的大部分历史中，他们也是兄弟姐妹国王的来源和所在地。门迪里安-艾瑞尼人专注于神秘的传说，许多最有天赋的巫师和工匠都是门迪里安人。门迪雅人对自己的外表感到特别自豪，他们喜欢华丽的图案和装饰的衣服，精致的发型，以及金属或皮革的面具。",
	"Centered around Pylas Zirinth, the line of Tolaen drives Aerenal's lumber industry, both harvesting wood for trade and producing the finest architects and wood-masons on the island. While they are devoted to the Undying Court, the Tolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts than in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen also produce many of Aerenal's soldiers and usually have good relations with the Tairnadal. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple, functional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are usually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen soldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.": "以Pylas Zirinth为中心，Tolaen家族推动了Aerenal的木材工业，既为贸易收获木材，又培养了岛上最好的建筑师和木匠。虽然他们致力于不朽之庭，但托拉恩-艾瑞尼更多的是致力于完善物理工艺，而不是沉思形而上的奥秘。托拉恩也生产许多艾瑞纳的士兵，并且通常与泰尔纳达尔的关系良好。托拉恩-艾瑞尼人喜欢简单、实用的衣服，没有什么装饰品。托拉恩的面具通常由木头制成，可能会有复杂的雕刻；托拉恩士兵经常戴着半面具，遮住他们的下脸。",
	"All but unknown in the Five Nations, the Valraea are a line of {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}. Their ancestors were magebred and charged to guard and govern the coastline of Aerenal. While rare, Valraea can be encountered in any of the port cities of Aerenal and are represented in the Undying Court. While Valraea characters use the sea elf subrace instead of the Aereni elf subrace presented in chapter 6, they are culturally Aereni and all the other material in this section applies to them. Valraea typically dress in leather and are comfortable with casual nudity; they fashion masks from shell and bone. More information about the Valraea Aereni can be found in chapter 4.": "瓦拉亚人在五国中几乎无人知晓，他们是{@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}的一族。他们的祖先是魔法师，负责保卫和管理Aerenal的海岸线。虽然很稀少，但在Aerenal的任何一个港口城市都可以遇到Valraea，并且在不朽的法庭中也有代表。虽然瓦拉亚人使用海精灵亚种，而不是第6章中介绍的艾瑞尼精灵亚种，但他们在文化上属于艾瑞尼人，本节中的所有其他材料都适用于他们。瓦拉亚人通常穿着皮衣，对随意的裸露感到舒服；他们用贝壳和骨头制作面具。更多关于瓦拉亚人的信息可以在第四章中找到。",

It may not be provable, but you believe it's a concrete environmental threat—have you noticed plants tend to die in places with lots of undead? As someone who's going to live a long time, your people take these things seriously. While you can put up with their presence if a situation absolutely requires it, you likely consider negative undead a serious threat.": "作为Aereni，你习惯于与死人一起生活，但那些没有死亡的人是用正能量维持的。与此相反，不死阁教导说，马巴兰亡灵--负能量的亡灵，从骷髅和僵尸到地衣和吸血鬼，都具有内在的破坏性。除了他们中的许多人为了生存而捕食活人之外，他们是马巴的通道，仅仅因为存在而耗尽了世界的环境生命。这可能无法证明，但你相信这是一个具体的环境威胁--你是否注意到在有大量亡灵的地方，植物往往会死亡？作为一个要活很久的人，你的人对这些事情很重视。虽然如果情况绝对需要，你可以忍受他们的存在，但你很可能认为负面的亡灵是一个严重的威胁。",
	"As an Aereni elf in Khorvaire, you're far from home. Are you an exile, an emissary, or a simple tourist? Here are some ways your background might affect your character's new life.": "作为霍尔韦尔的艾瑞尼精灵，你离家很远。你是一个流亡者，一个使者，还是一个普通的游客？这里有一些你的背景可能会影响你的角色的新生活的方式。",
	"As an acolyte, you're a recognized servant of the Undying Court. Temples of the Undying Court are rare in Khorvaire, but they can be found in major cities. Beyond this, you can request minor assistance from any Aereni; they won't place themselves in danger, but they'll show respect and support you.": "作为一名圣徒，你是不死阁公认的仆人。不死阁的寺庙在霍尔韦尔很少见，但在主要城市可以找到。除此之外，你可以向任何艾瑞尼人请求小的援助；他们不会将自己置于危险之中，但他们会对你表示尊重和支持。",
	"Crime is rare in Aerenal, but these backgrounds can reflect a connection to criminal organizations in Khorvaire. This could be something your family developed for business. It could be tied to your personal history, especially if you're an exile from Aerenal. Or you could be an agent of the Cairdal Blades—one of their spies—in which case you might be using criminal connections as a source of information.": "在阿伦纳尔，犯罪是罕见的，但这些背景可以反映出与霍尔韦尔的犯罪组织有联系。这可能是你的家族为了生意而发展的。它可能与你的个人历史有关，特别是如果你是一个来自Aerenal的流亡者。或者你可能是凯尔达尔之刃的特工--他们的间谍--在这种情况下，你可能利用犯罪关系作为信息来源。",
	"As an entertainer, your Popular Demand feature could reflect your reputation in Aerenal, Khorvaire, or both. Are your performances tied to the traditions of your ancestors or are you creating something new? Are you willing to work with House Phiarlan or House Thuranni—who will want to license any popular act—or do you despise the dragonmarked for abandoning Aerenal, refusing to work with them?": "作为一个艺人，你的 \"流行需求 \"功能可以反映你在艾瑞纳、霍尔韦尔或两者的声誉。你的表演是与你的祖先的传统联系在一起，还是你在创造新的东西？你是否愿意与皮亚伦家族或瑟兰尼家族合作--他们会想要许可任何受欢迎的行为--或者你鄙视龙纹家族放弃阿伦纳尔，拒绝与他们合作？",
	"Being considered a folk hero in Aerenal won't do you much good if you're adventuring in Khorvaire. The question is what you've done {@i since} arriving in Khorvaire to earn this reputation... and just as important, why. What is it that would drive you to fight for the common people of a distant land? Is it tied to the reason you left Aerenal? Are you just an altruist, or have you carefully constructed your identity as a folk hero as part of some grand design that could take a century to bear fruit?": "如果你在Khorvaire冒险，在Aerenal被认为是一个民间英雄对你没有什么好处。问题是你到了霍尔韦尔后做了什么（%0%）来赢得这个声誉......同样重要的是，为什么。是什么促使你为一个遥远的地方的普通人而战？它与你离开阿伦纳的原因有关吗？你只是一个利他主义者，还是你精心构建了你作为民间英雄的身份，作为一些可能需要一个世纪才能开花结果的宏伟设计的一部分？",
	"Both of these are sound paths for Aereni. An Aereni scholar could make an excellent sage. As a hermit, you may have had a vision from the Undying Court or a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy that has led you to distant lands.": "这两点对Aereni来说都是合理的途径。一个Aereni学者可以成为一个优秀的圣人。作为一个隐士，你可能有来自不死宫廷的异象，或者瞥见了龙人的预言，从而将你带到了遥远的地方。",
	"As a member of a noble line, you weren't born to your position, you were raised into it. What did you do to earn this honor? You're seen as one of the most promising members of your line, but you're also expected to serve the interests of your line and your people; do you embrace this duty? While you may not be a noble of the Five Nations, most of the nations of Khorvaire show great respect to Aereni nobles, and your Position of Privilege should still open doors in high society": "作为一个贵族家族的成员，你不是生来就有这个地位的，你是被养成的。你做了什么来赢得这个荣誉？你被视为你的家族中最有前途的成员之一，但你也被期望为你的家族和你的人民的利益服务；你是否接受这一职责？虽然你可能不是五国的贵族，但霍尔韦尔的大多数国家都对艾瑞尼贵族表现出极大的尊重，你的特权地位仍然可以在上流社会打开大门。",
	"The line of Melideth are the sailors of the Aereni. While Aerenal has little interest in exploration and remained neutral in the Last War, Melideth traders can be found across the seas.": "梅利达斯一系是艾瑞尼的水手。虽然艾瑞尼对探索没有什么兴趣，并在最后一次战争中保持中立，但在大洋彼岸可以找到梅利达斯商人。",
	"You may have served in the armed forces of your line, or you might be a member of the Deathguard, the elite military force tasked to eliminate negative undead (a logical background for a cleric or paladin). Your rank will likely be recognized by any loyal citizen of Aerenal. While you have no authority in the Five Nations, officers may at least respect you as a fellow soldier. On the other hand, as an elf, you've had a long life; it could be that you left Aerenal a decade or two ago and served with one of the Five Nations. If so, what drew you into the war? How does your family feel about your actions?": "你可能曾在你的家族的武装力量中服役，或者你可能是死亡守卫的成员，这是一支负责消除负面不死生物的精英军队（对于牧师或圣骑士来说是一个合理的背景）。你的等级可能会被任何忠诚的艾瑞纳公民所认可。虽然你在五国中没有权力，但官员们至少会把你当作同胞士兵来尊重。另一方面，作为一个精灵，你已经有了很长的生命；可能你在一二十年前就离开了Aerenal，在五国之一服役。如果是这样，是什么吸引你加入战争的？你的家人对你的行为有什么看法？",
	"The {@background far traveler|scag} and {@background inheritor|scag} backgrounds from the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag} are sound choices for an Aereni elf. The {@background haunted one|cos} background from {@adventure Curse of Strahd|cos} could reflect something you saw in the Mabaran manifest zones of your homeland—or you could be literally haunted by an ancestor.": "来自{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}的{@background far traveler|scag}和{@background inheritor|scag}的背景是一个Aereni精灵的合理选择。来自{@adventure Curse of Strahd|cos}的{@background haunted one|cos}背景可以反映出你在家乡的马巴兰宣言区看到的东西，或者你可能真的被一个祖先缠住了。",
	"The Aereni are the dominant culture of Aerenal. The Tairnadal are a separate culture that came to Aerenal during the exodus and laid claim to the northern steppes. Rather than preserving their ancestors as deathless or {@i spirit idols}, the Tairnadal believe they anchor their ancestors by emulating their heroic deeds.": "艾瑞尼人是艾瑞纳尔的主流文化。泰尔纳达尔人是一种独立的文化，他们在逃亡期间来到艾瑞纳尔，并对北部草原提出了要求。泰尔纳达尔人认为，他们不是把自己的祖先当作不死之身或（%0%）来保存，而是通过模仿他们的英雄事迹来固定祖先。",
	"The Tairnadal have a long alliance with the Aereni and fight alongside their cousins when the island is threatened. It's possible for elves to immigrate from one culture to another; the line of Tolaen is known for having close ties to the Tairnadal. But they're separate cultures; the Tairnadal don't worship the Undying Court and its warriors don't become deathless.": "泰尔纳达尔人与艾瑞尼人长期结盟，当岛屿受到威胁时与他们的表亲并肩作战。精灵有可能从一种文化移民到另一种文化；托拉恩一系因与泰尔纳达尔有密切联系而闻名。但它们是独立的文化；泰尔纳达尔人不崇拜不朽之庭，它的战士也不会变成不死之身。",
	"You were born with a bond to an otherworldly being. You have memories of a life you've never lived, visions of battling fiends and an endless struggle against darkness. When you sleep, you don't dream as others do, but you often wake with a sense of purpose or new ideas. You see the pain and suffering in the world and know that there is a path to light—but there are monsters in the shadows, faceless enemies that have been hunting you since before you were born.": "你出生时就与一个异世界的存在有联系。你有关于你从未经历过的生活的记忆，有与恶魔战斗的幻觉，有与黑暗的无尽斗争。当你睡觉时，你不像其他人那样做梦，但你经常带着目的感或新想法醒来。你看到世界上的痛苦和磨难，知道有一条通往光明的道路--但阴影中还有怪物，那些不露面的敌人从你出生前就一直在追捕你。",
	"Will you embrace the spirit within you and make its struggle your own? Will you stand against the darkness, even if it draws the many eyes of the Dreaming Dark upon you? Or will you ignore that inner voice and try to live your own life?": "你是否会拥抱你内心的精神，并把它的斗争作为你自己的斗争？你是否会站在黑暗的对立面，即使它吸引了许多梦想中的黑暗的眼睛来关注你？或者，你会无视那内心的声音，试图过你自己的生活吗？",
	"The quori are spirits of nightmare. But just as angels can fall, fiends can rise. Centuries ago, a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that dominates Dal Quor. The Dreaming Dark hunted them across the dreamscape, seeking to consume and reclaim them. In desperation, these rebel spirits reached out to Eberron, finding a haven in the minds and bodies of a group of Adaran monks. Sixty-seven spirits escaped, and the first kalashtar were born.": "科里是噩梦的灵魂。但就像天使会堕落一样，恶魔也会崛起。几个世纪前，一小撮科里人背叛了主宰达尔-库尔的邪恶力量il-Lashtavar。梦中的黑暗在整个梦境中追捕他们，试图吞噬并夺回他们。在绝望中，这些反叛的灵魂向艾伯伦伸出了援手，在一群阿达兰僧侣的思想和身体中找到了庇护所。六十七个灵魂逃了出来，第一批卡拉斯塔诞生了。",
	"As a kalashtar, you're descended from one of these monks. A quori is bound to your bloodline. It exists in the minds and dreams of all of your siblings, and as long as one of you is alive the quori is sustained. Should you all die, the spirit will be lost... and so, the Dreaming Dark is always happy to kill a kalashtar.": "作为一个卡拉什塔，你是这些僧侣中的一个的后代。Quori与你的血脉紧密相连。它存在于你所有兄弟姐妹的思想和梦境中，只要你们中的一个人活着，就能维持 \"魁力\"。如果你们都死了，精神就会丧失......因此，做梦的黑暗总是很高兴能杀死一个卡拉什塔。",
	"The kalashtar were born centuries ago, and have since spread out from Adar. What is your background? What has set you on the path to adventure? Are you searching for allies against the Dreaming Dark, or are you pursuing a mission of your own?": "卡拉什塔人诞生于几个世纪前，此后从阿达尔扩散出去。你的背景是什么？是什么让你走上了冒险的道路？你是在寻找对抗梦幻黑暗的盟友，还是在追求你自己的使命？",
	"The kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won't be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light.": "卡拉斯塔人出生在遥远的亚达大陆的萨洛纳。今天，里德拉帝国统治着萨洛纳，帝国军队无休止地围攻阿达尔。阿达尔的僧侣和祭司们相信，与启发者和il-Lashtavar的战争不会靠武器取胜；相反，祈祷和指导冥想将最终把平衡从黑暗转向光明。",
	"Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. If you are from Adar, what caused you to leave your monastery and brave the Riedran blockades? Have the elders entrusted you with a specific mission, or has your quori spirit driven you to distant lands? The hermit background is a good way to reflect a mystic from a distant land possessing dangerous revelations.": "阿达兰卡拉斯塔很少无缘无故地采取直接行动。如果你来自阿达，是什么原因导致你离开你的修道院，勇敢面对里德兰的封锁？是长老们委托你去完成一个特定的任务，还是你的夸里精神驱使你去遥远的地方？隐士背景是反映一个来自远方拥有危险启示的神秘主义者的好方法。",
	"Of all the origins mentioned here, you likely have the strongest connection to your quori spirit. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. You were taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness; can you reconcile this with your adventuring life? If you've recently arrived in Khorvaire after living your life in a monastery, you are unaccustomed to crime and greed. Is the chaos of a city like Sharn disorienting?": "在这里提到的所有起源中，你很可能与你的奎里精神有最强的联系。Adaran kalashtar是禁欲主义者，有纪律，专注于光明之路。你被教导要激励那些生活在恐惧中的人，启迪那些迷失在黑暗中的人；你能把这一点与你的冒险生活相协调吗？如果你在修道院生活后最近才来到霍尔韦尔，你不习惯犯罪和贪婪。像沙恩这样混乱的城市是否让人迷失方向？",
	"There are kalashtar communities in several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. Kalashtar prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. If you were raised in such a community, you're familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there's no Riedran army at the gates; you know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it's a ghost in the shadows.": "在五国的几个主要城市都有卡拉什塔社区，包括沙恩的眺望区和费尔海文的白墙。卡拉什塔人喜欢彼此靠近，既是为了实践他们共同的传统，也是为了共同抵御任何由梦幻黑暗构成的威胁。如果你在这样的社区长大，你就会熟悉光明之路和其他卡拉什塔人的习俗。但门口没有瑞德兰军队；你知道逐梦的黑暗是一种威胁，但它是阴影中的一个幽灵。",
	"Many kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don't believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and to ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher's focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.": "许多卡拉什塔只是想通过他们的日常行为来传播光明，例如表现出仁慈和同情心或调解争端。另一方面，霍尔韦尔的一些卡拉什塔人在与黑暗的斗争中走上了一条残酷的道路。影子守望者不相信邪恶可以仅仅通过仁慈和祈祷来对抗。这个组织的成员寻求确定腐败的来源，并无情地消除它们。虽然暗影监视者的重点是梦幻黑暗的代理人，但他们可以追捕任何邪恶的力量，无论是超自然的还是其他的。",
	"As a kalashtar of Khorvaire, you could bring a compassionate approach to any background; whether you're an acolyte of the Path of Light, a wise sage, or a lively entertainer, you do your best to help the innocent and lift spirits. Criminal and charlatan would be unusual paths, but the spy background could reflect the work of a Shadow Watcher. While you aren't as isolated from the world as an Adaran kalashtar, you're still guided by alien instincts and have an otherworldly demeanor.": "作为霍尔韦尔的卡拉什塔，你可以为任何背景带来一种同情心；无论你是光明之路的信徒、明智的圣人，还是活泼的艺人，你都会尽力帮助无辜的人，提升精神。犯罪分子和江湖术士将是不寻常的道路，但间谍背景可以反映出影子监视者的工作。虽然你不像阿达兰-卡拉什塔人那样与世隔绝，但你仍然被外星的本能所引导，并有一种异世界的气质。",
	"Kalashtar can breed with humans and half-elves, and their children have an equal chance of being fully kalashtar or the race of the other parent. Kalashtar are quite rare; even in cities like Sharn with kalashtar communities, there are many people who will assume kalashtar are just humans with strange eyes... or some sort of half-elf, maybe? Maybe it's a new fashion?": "卡拉什塔人可以与人类和半精灵交配，他们的孩子有同样的机会成为完全的卡拉什塔人或另一个父母的种族。卡拉什塔人相当罕见；即使在像沙恩这样有卡拉什塔人社区的城市，也有很多人会认为卡拉什塔人只是有奇怪眼睛的人类......或者某种半精灵，也许？也许这是一种新的时尚？",
	"As such, there are kalashtar in Khorvaire who grew up without the guidance of a kalashtar parent. Orphans may be entirely unaware of their heritage and the nature of their quori spirit—it tries to communicate through dream-visions and instincts, but lacking any context, such orphans rarely understand their quori bond. Nonetheless, the quori is an integral part of them, urging them toward the light—and indeed, most orphans follow such a path. A kalashtar orphan who chooses a darker path is fighting the instincts imparted by their spirit. Such a kalashtar is likely to be deeply conflicted, which can manifest as unidentified stress, fits of rage, depression, or unpredictable behavior.": "因此，在Khorvaire有一些卡拉什塔人，他们在没有卡拉什塔人父母的指导下成长起来。孤儿们可能完全不知道他们的遗产和他们的quori精神的性质--它试图通过梦境和本能来沟通，但由于缺乏任何背景，这些孤儿很少理解他们的quori纽带。尽管如此，\"魁力 \"是他们不可分割的一部分，敦促他们走向光明--事实上，大多数孤儿都走上了这样一条道路。一个选择黑暗道路的卡拉什塔孤儿是在与他们的精神所赋予的本能作斗争。这样的卡拉什塔人可能会有很深的冲突，这可以表现为不明的压力、愤怒、抑郁或不可预测的行为。",
	"An orphan kalashtar can follow any path. Whether altruistic, nefarious, or somewhere in between, work with your DM to decide how you interpret the influence of your quori bond. Have you followed its guidance despite not knowing its true nature? Do you interpret it as a curse or ghost, twisting your thoughts and putting you at odds with yourself? Have you found the inner determination to suppress it entirely? Do you ultimately want to come to terms with your kalashtar nature, or do you like being an outsider and prefer to stay that way?": "一个孤儿卡拉什塔可以走任何道路。无论是利他主义的、邪恶的，还是介于两者之间的，请与你的DM合作，决定你如何解释你的Qori纽带的影响。尽管你不知道它的真实性质，但你是否遵循它的指导？你是否把它解释为一种诅咒或幽灵，扭曲你的思想，使你与自己产生矛盾？你是否找到了完全压制它的内在决心？你最终是想接受你的卡拉什塔本性，还是喜欢做一个局外人，并宁愿保持这种状态？",
	"As a kalashtar, you're part of a spiritual lineage, traditionally reflected by the suffix of your name. For example, Lanhareth and Minhareth are both kalashtar of the lineage of Hareth. Your lineage is set before birth, tied to one of your parents. If you are born to kalashtar of Vaktri and Hareth, you inherit only one of the bonds, often that of the parent of your gender. Since you can't inherit both bonds, you won't be half Hareth and half Vaktri. Your lineage affects your appearance and personality, eye color, hair color, and other aspects. When you meet another kalashtar of your lineage, you'll see common traits, but you'll also feel a deeper connection; in some ways, you're one person.": "作为卡拉什塔，你是精神世系的一部分，传统上由你名字的后缀反映。例如，Lanhareth和Minhareth都是Hareth血统的卡拉什塔人。你的血统在出生前就已确定，与你的父母之一联系在一起。如果你是由瓦克特里和哈雷斯的卡拉什塔所生，你只能继承其中一个纽带，通常是你性别的父母的纽带。由于你不能同时继承两种纽带，所以你不会是一半哈雷斯和一半瓦克特里。你的血统会影响你的外表和性格、眼睛颜色、头发颜色和其他方面。当你遇到另一个与你同一血统的卡拉什塔，你会看到共同的特征，但你也会感到更深的联系；在某些方面，你们是一个人。",
	"The quori bond exists on a deep level. Your quori doesn't hover over your shoulder or whisper in your ear. Instead, it exists in the collective subconscious of all kalashtar of your lineage, shaping and guiding you all. You feel it as instinct, in memories of things you've never done—visions of a war in the realm of dreams. When you sleep, you don't dream, but the bond grows stronger. Your quori may even give visions to guide you. With time and training, you can strengthen this connection, learning to hear its psychic voice more clearly; the Quori Bond feat presented in chapter 6 is one way to reflect this stronger bond. Ultimately, it's up to you how you roleplay your connection. While the quori isn't an active presence that responds in conversation, some kalashtar do speak to it as if it was, talking with the quori as a way of processing their own thoughts. Others take comfort in its subconscious presence, confident it is with them at all times. And some—notably orphans—refuse to acknowledge it, determined to see their mind as their own.": "魁北克的关系存在于一个很深的层次。你的quori不会在你的肩膀上盘旋或在你耳边低语。相反，它存在于你的血统中所有卡拉什塔人的集体潜意识中，塑造并指导着你们所有人。你觉得它是一种本能，在你从未做过的事情的记忆中--在梦境中的战争预想。当你睡觉时，你不会做梦，但这种联系却越来越强。你的奎里甚至会发出幻觉来引导你。随着时间的推移和训练，你可以加强这种联系，学会更清楚地听到它的心灵之声；第6章中介绍的Quori Bond壮举是反映这种更强联系的一种方式。归根结底，这取决于你如何扮演你的联系。虽然Quori并不是一个能在对话中做出反应的主动存在，但一些卡拉什塔人确实像它一样与它对话，把与Quori对话作为处理他们自己想法的一种方式。其他人则对它的潜意识存在感到安慰，相信它一直与他们在一起。而有些人--特别是孤儿--拒绝承认它，决心把自己的思想看作是自己的。",
	"In creating a kalashtar character, it's important to consider what type of quori you're bound to. You can develop this through roleplaying, but it can also be reflected by your choice of class and by your abilities or spells. Each quori has a connection to a particular emotion. Fiendish quori feed on this emotion, using it to manipulate mortals. In your case, it could be that you understand how to generate that emotion in others, or that you yourself experience that emotion in a deep and powerful way. Or it could be that you have learned how to suppress that emotion, and that is the source of your strength. Whatever choice you make, it will be reflected throughout your lineage. If you decide that Vaktri is a du'ulora quori and that you draw on his burning fury to produce your own barbarian rage, then other Vaktri kalashtar you meet may also be barbarians or furious warriors.": "在创建一个卡拉什塔角色时，重要的是要考虑你与哪种类型的奎里有缘。你可以通过角色扮演来发展这一点，但它也可以通过你选择的等级和你的能力或法术来反映。每一个quori都与一种特定的情感有联系。邪恶的奎里以这种情感为食，利用它来操纵凡人。就你而言，你可能了解如何在他人身上产生这种情感，或者你自己以一种深刻而强大的方式体验到这种情感。也可能是你已经学会了如何压制这种情绪，而这就是你力量的来源。无论你做出什么选择，它都会反映在你的整个血统中。如果你决定瓦克特里是一个du'ulora quori，并且你从他燃烧的愤怒中汲取营养，产生你自己的野蛮人的愤怒，那么你遇到的其他瓦克特里卡拉什塔也可能是野蛮人或愤怒的战士。",
	"The three quori presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} are described below, along with another fourth common quori, the du'ulora, whose statistics are presented in chapter 8.

	"The fiendish du'ulora are spirits of rage and aggression. In Dal Quor, they craft dreams that drive feuds and vendettas, spurring mortals to violence and vengeance. Your du'ulora spirit has turned against the darkness, but fury remains its domain and anger is your birthright. How do you express this? As a bard, you might specialize in taunting enemies, turning their anger against them and driving them to rash action. As a barbarian, you could say that your spirit is the source of your rage. As a paladin, you might channel its fury when you smite your foes. You might be calm and serene most of the time, expressing sudden powerful moments of rage when you draw on your bond.": "邪恶的杜罗拉是愤怒和侵略的灵魂。在达尔-库尔，他们制作的梦境推动着仇怨和报复，刺激着凡人的暴力和复仇。你的du'ulora精神已经转向反对黑暗，但愤怒仍然是它的领域，愤怒是你的天赋权利。你如何表达这个？作为一个吟游诗人，你可能擅长嘲弄敌人，将他们的愤怒转向他们，促使他们采取轻率的行动。作为一个野蛮人，你可以说你的精神是你愤怒的源泉。作为一个圣骑士，你可能会在打击敌人时引导它的怒火。你可能在大多数时候都是平静安详的，当你利用你的纽带时，会突然表达出强大的愤怒。",
	"The key thing to remember is that your du'ulora has chosen the path of light, even if it is a spirit of rage. You may revel in moments when you get to unleash your anger on your enemies, but it still drives you to fight for a noble cause. Your fury is a tool, and you should never let it drag you into darkness.": "要记住的关键是，你的du'ulora已经选择了光明的道路，即使是愤怒的精神。你可能会陶醉在对敌人释放愤怒的时刻，但它仍然促使你为崇高的事业而战。你的愤怒是一种工具，你不应该让它把你拖入黑暗。",
	"The hashalaq are seducers and deceivers, feeding on doubt and desire. They are the spies and loremasters of the quori. Hashalaq kalashtar make excellent bards; the College of Lore reflects both your love of knowledge and your ability to confuse your foes. Hashalaq make excellent warlocks, with your spirit granting the {@optfeature Beguiling Influence} invocation and allowing you to charm your enemies. As a hashalaq kalashtar, consider whether you specialize in deception, or choose to be honest and focus on your ability to inspire positive emotion—do you prefer cunning {@skill Deception} or empathic {@skill Persuasion}? Hashalaq clerics typically follow this latter path, using their knowledge to guide allies and cut through the deception that comes so naturally to their kind.": "哈撒拉克是诱惑者和欺骗者，以怀疑和欲望为食。他们是科里人的间谍和传说家。哈沙拉克-卡拉什塔是优秀的吟游诗人；传说学院反映了你对知识的热爱和你迷惑敌人的能力。哈沙拉克人是优秀的术士，你的精神赋予了{@optfeature Beguiling Influence}召唤术，并允许你迷惑你的敌人。作为一个哈沙拉克的卡拉什塔，请考虑你是专攻欺骗，还是选择诚实，专注于你激发积极情感的能力--你是喜欢狡猾的（%1%）还是同情的（%2%）？哈沙拉克教士通常走后一条路，用他们的知识来引导盟友，并穿过对他们来说很自然的欺骗。",
	"The kalaraq are spirits of pride and ambition. The natural leaders of the quori, they dominate through sheer charisma and force of will. As a kalaraq kalashtar, you surely have your own grand ambitions. You excel at inspiring others to follow you and you won't hesitate to take bold action. You might lead in the vanguard as a paladin, or strengthen your allies as a cleric, or bend enemies to your will as a bard of the {@class bard||College of Glamour|glamour|XGE}.

	"The kalaraq are the rarest and most powerful of the quori. The kalaraq Taratai was the leader of the rebels, and hers is the only spiritual lineage that has been completely destroyed by Dreaming Dark; Taratai's own fate is unknown.

	"The tsucora feed on terror and craft the most classic nightmares. As a tsucora kalashtar, you have a deep understanding of fear.

	"Kalashtar are known for their psychic gifts, but aside from their Mind Link, how does this manifest in a kalashtar character? In fifth edition, how do they wield mental power? Chapter 6 presents a Mind Domain cleric and two kalashtar racial feats. In addition, characters carry an innate sense of mental discipline—a kalashtar monk could consider ki as a representation of psionic ability, and the Living Weapon monastic tradition in chapter 6 builds on this. But you can also change the flavor of a class without altering the mechanics. Consider the following ideas.": "Kalashtar以他们的精神天赋而闻名，但除了他们的心灵链接外，这在Kalashtar角色中是如何体现的？在第五版中，他们是如何挥舞精神力量的？第6章介绍了一个心灵领域的牧师和两个卡拉什塔人的种族特技。此外，角色还带有一种与生俱来的精神纪律感--卡拉什塔僧侣可以将ki视为幻术能力的代表，而第六章中的活体武器僧侣传统则是建立在这个基础之上的。但你也可以在不改变机制的情况下改变一个类别的味道。请考虑以下想法。",
	"Many kalashtar seek to fight evil through inspiration, and the bard can be an excellent foundation for this. While Bardic Inspiration is described as \"stirring words or music,\" you can describe your actions as being tied to psychic gifts; instead of a mystical song, you could describe your inspiration as a word backed by a surge of psychic energy. When you use the Words of Terror of the {@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE} or the Cutting Words of the {@class bard||College of Lore|lore}, this could easily reflect your powers of psychic manipulation. Likewise, your spellcasting is mechanically magic; it can be counterspelled, it won't work in an {@spell antimagic field}, and so on. But you can easily describe {@spell vicious mockery} or {@spell crown of madness} as psychic attacks, or present {@spell cure wounds} as a psychometabolic effect, using your mind to knit together the wounds of another. You gain no mechanical advantage from this—in the case of Bardic Inspiration, your target still has to be able to hear you, even if you're using psychic power—but there's nothing preventing you from presenting your bard as being psychically gifted as opposed to singing magic songs.": "许多卡拉什塔人寻求通过灵感来对抗邪恶，而吟游诗人可以成为这方面的一个很好的基础。虽然吟游诗人的灵感被描述为 \"激动人心的话语或音乐\"，但你可以把你的行动描述为与灵性的天赋联系在一起；而不是一首神秘的歌曲，你可以把你的灵感描述为由涌动的灵性能量支持的一个词。当你使用{@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}的恐怖之语或{@class bard||College of Lore|lore}的切割之语时，这很容易反映出你的精神操纵能力。同样地，你的咒语是机械性的魔法；它可以被反咒，在（%2%）的情况下不会起作用，等等。但你可以很容易地将（3%）或（4%）描述为精神攻击，或将（5%）呈现为精神代谢效果，用你的思想将他人的伤口编织起来。你没有从中获得任何机械优势--就吟游诗人的灵感而言，你的目标仍然必须能够听到你的声音，即使你使用的是精神力量--但没有什么能阻止你把吟游诗人说成是有精神天赋的，而不是唱魔法歌曲。",
	"Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic. Priests of the Path of Light say that the faithful are inspired by il-Yannah—the great light that will one day rise to replace the Dreaming Dark—but their power comes from within. As such, both cleric and paladin are logical paths for a kalashtar, and you can add psychic flavor to your spells as described with the bard above. When you cast {@spell command}, you aren't demanding your victim bow to il-Yannah; instead, il-Yannah is strengthening your mind and allowing you to impose your will on the target. Effects such as {@spell bless} could reflect your ongoing psychic guidance, while {@spell cure wounds} and similar spells could be psychometabolic. Your faith helps you focus your mind, but it's your mind that generates the power. If you want to take this farther, the {@class cleric||Mind domain|mind|ExploringEberron} presented in chapter 6 allows you to replace radiant damage with psychic damage; thus, you can flavor your {@spell sacred flame} as a psionic blast instead of holy fire.": "大多数卡拉什塔人都献身于光明之路，虽然它的信徒不崇拜任何神灵，但信仰本身可以成为神圣魔法的来源。光明之路的牧师们说，信徒们受到了伊尔-雅娜的启发--有朝一日会崛起取代梦幻黑暗的伟大之光--但他们的力量来自于内心。因此，牧师和圣骑士都是卡拉斯塔的合理途径，你可以像上面吟游诗人所描述的那样为你的法术添加灵性的味道。当你施展（%0%）时，你并没有要求你的受害者向il-Yannah鞠躬；相反，il-Yannah正在加强你的思想，并允许你将你的意志强加给目标。诸如(1%)这样的效果可以反映出你正在进行的精神指导，而(2%)和类似的法术可能是精神代谢。你的信仰帮助你集中精神，但产生力量的是你的思想。如果你想走得更远，第六章中介绍的{@class cleric||Mind domain|mind|ExploringEberron}允许你用精神伤害取代辐射伤害；因此，你可以把你的{@spell sacred flame}当作幻象爆炸而不是圣火。",
	"This same concept can work for a {@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE} sorcerer. You don't use the trappings of a priest, but your visions of il-Yannah have allowed you to focus your mind and alter reality. You can select spells that feel like they could be psychic powers; when you cast mage hand, it can be flavored as an act of telekinesis.": "这个概念同样可以适用于{@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE}巫师。你不使用牧师的外衣，但你对il-Yannah的幻觉使你能够集中精神并改变现实。你可以选择那些感觉像是通灵能力的法术；当你施展法师之手时，它可以被调味成心灵感应的行为。",

As a warlock, you might have an especially strong bond to this spirit and receive clearer visions than most kalashtar of your lineage; traditionally, kalashtar with such a strong connection are called atavists. The {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} is an easy choice, as many of its spells reflect mental manipulation; you can describe {@spell Evard's black tentacles} as ectoplasmic projections, or {@spell armor of Agathys} as a blend of telekinetic force and cryokinesis. The Awakened Mind feature soon becomes obsolete due to Mind Link; a DM could choose to combine the two, increasing the range of a kalashtar warlock's Mind Link feature by 30 feet. The {@class warlock||Celestial|celestial|XGE} patron is another logical choice, focusing on your quori as a spirit of light. As a {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} or any warlock using the {@optfeature Pact of the Blade}, you can describe your weapon as being forged from nightmares.": "你可以简单地将你的术士法术描述为来自精神力量，而不是奥术召唤。你的守护者是你的奎里精神。作为一个术士，你可能与这个精神有特别强烈的联系，并且比你的血统中的大多数卡拉什塔人得到更清晰的视野；传统上，具有这种强烈联系的卡拉什塔人被称为阿塔夫。{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}是一个简单的选择，因为它的许多法术都反映了精神操纵；你可以把{@spell Evard's black tentacles}描述为外质投影，或者{@spell armor of Agathys}描述为心灵感应和低温运动的混合。由于心灵链接的存在，觉醒的心灵功能很快就会被淘汰；DM可以选择将两者结合起来，将卡拉什塔术士的心灵链接功能的范围增加30英尺。{@class warlock||Celestial|celestial|XGE}的守护者是另一个合理的选择，专注于你作为光之精灵的quori。作为{@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}或任何使用{@optfeature Pact of the Blade}的术士，你可以将你的武器描述为由噩梦铸成。",

	"{@b Lurashtai} began her existence as a tsucora quori. She wove dreams of gothic horror, playing on her victims' fears of death and the undead. Raised on these morbid memories, the kalashtar of her line are comfortable with tragedy, have no fear of death, and see beauty in things that others find disturbing or terrifying. As a spirit of light, Lurashtai has taken an interest in the undead; she fears that by being trapped outside the cycle of life and dream, the undead weaken the shared soul of the age. As a result, the kalashtar of her line are often driven to hunt undead and lay their spirits to rest. Lurashtai kalashtar usually have pale complexions, sharp features, and silky, dark hair; they generally favor the color red in their clothing.": "{@b Lurashtai}开始她的存在是作为一个tsucora quori。她编织着哥特式恐怖的梦境，利用受害者对死亡和亡灵的恐惧。在这些病态的记忆中长大，她那一系的卡拉什塔对悲剧感到舒服，对死亡没有恐惧，并在别人认为令人不安或可怕的事物中看到了美。作为一个光之精灵，露拉丝泰对亡灵产生了兴趣；她担心，由于被困在生命和梦想的循环之外，亡灵会削弱这个时代的共同灵魂。因此，她这一系的卡拉什塔人经常被驱使去猎杀亡灵，让他们的灵魂安息。卢拉什泰-卡拉什塔通常有苍白的肤色，尖锐的特征，以及丝质的黑发；他们一般喜欢红色的衣服。",
	"{@b Aveth}, a hashalaq quori, wielded the twin weapons of manipulation and insight before his exodus from Dal Quor. He takes great interest in the potential that mortals hold to choose a nobler path, much as he and his kind fled Darkness in search of Light.

They have great confidence in their ability to win over potential foes, turning them into friends, which can yield unexpected allies—or the untimely death of the too-optimistic kalashtar.

	"As a shifter adventurer, you walk a path between the wilds and the civilized world. You are driven by primal instincts, the whispers of Wolf or Rat. When you embrace those voices, you transform.

Or do you hate shifting, fearing that you might one day lose yourself to the beast within?": "作为一个变身者的冒险者，你走在荒野和文明世界之间的路上。你被原始的本能所驱使，狼或鼠的低语。当你接受这些声音时，你就会转变。你是否将你的转变形态视为真正的自我，陶醉于这些原始的升华时刻？还是你讨厌转变，担心有一天你会被内心的野兽所迷惑？",

The bulk of the shifter population of Khorvaire is based in the Towering Wood, the vast forest that stretches across the northwest. Over the last four decades, shifters have emerged from the deep woods to live in the farmlands of the Eldeen Reaches, shaping the culture of this new nation. Outside the Towering Wood, many shifters fled the violence and persecution of the Silver Crusade, leading to their scattering across the Five Nations. While the hysteria of the Silver Crusade has long since died down, there are still many who treat shifters with fear or suspicion. {@i They're weretouched, more beast than human. They're prone to violence—they can't help it.

If you're from such a tribe, what drove you to leave the woods? Are you following a druidic prophecy? Pursuing an ancient evil that's escaped from the wood? Have you been exiled from your tribe, or are you simply driven by curiosity?

Shifters have full control over their gifts, while lycanthropes struggle with them. The beast within may shape a shifter's personality, but it doesn't overwhelm it. By contrast, lycanthropy attempts to destroy the victim's original personality and can turn the most virtuous hero into a bloodthirsty murderer. Wererats and werewolves are cruel killers... but Grandmother Wolf doesn't encourage savagery, and Grandfather Rat doesn't urge murder.

	"The Silver Crusade began when a dark power surged in the Towering Wood, amplifying the power of lycanthropy. The curse became more virulent. Victims fell prey to its power more quickly, guided by some dark power beyond the common evil of the curse. Within the Towering Woods, tribes of shifters fought their corrupted kin. Beyond it, the farmers of Aundair were tormented by raiding wolves and boars. When the templars responded, the beasts that were slain reverted to their natural forms, revealing that they were shifters. The word quickly spread: all shifters were weretouched, capable of turning into savage beasts. None could be trusted! Meanwhile, among the shifter tribes, scouts warned of atrocities committed by the foreign soldiers. In fact, the demagogues on both sides were wererats working to ensure that these possible allies would instead become bitter enemies... and the trick worked. Frightened templars and paranoid mobs slew many innocent shifters, and to this day the extremist sect known as the Pure Flame claims all shifters are servants of darkness.": "白银十字军开始时，一股黑暗的力量在高耸的森林中涌动，放大了狼人的力量。诅咒变得更加剧烈。受害者更快成为其力量的牺牲品，被某种黑暗的力量所引导，超越了诅咒的普通邪恶。在高耸的森林里，变种人部落与他们被腐蚀的亲属战斗。在它之外，昂代尔的农民们被突袭的狼和野猪折磨着。当圣殿骑士们做出反应时，被杀死的野兽恢复了它们的自然形态，显示出它们是变身者。消息很快传开了：所有的变身者都被感染了，能够变成野蛮的野兽。没有人可以信任! 同时，在变身者部落中，侦察员警告说，外国士兵犯下了暴行。事实上，双方的煽动者都在努力确保这些可能的盟友反而会成为痛苦的敌人......而且这招很有效。惊恐的圣殿骑士和偏执的暴徒杀害了许多无辜的变身者，直到今天，被称为 \"纯净火焰 \"的极端主义教派声称所有变身者都是黑暗的仆人。",
	"The fact of the matter is that {@i lycanthropy is a weapon}; it spreads through violence and turns its victims into killers. Its origins may never be discovered, but the Moonspeaker tale is as logical as any. Lycanthropes and shifters are related in that the first lycanthropes were cursed shifters. The unknown force responsible was likely also behind the surge that caused the Silver Crusade—and it could rise again. One logical contender is the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. It's said that Dyrrn created doppelgangers by twisting changelings; it could have used this same technique to create lycanthropes from shifters. Or it could have been the work of an overlord, an archfiend of the Age of Demons; some texts speak of the Wild Heart, an overlord who destroys civilizations and feeds on primal cruelty. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if the answer will be revealed, and if so, what it is. In battling the cults of the Dragon Below, could you face the original shifter champions corrupted by Dyrrn? Or might the schemes of the Lords of Dust unleash the Wild Heart?": "事实是，（%0%）；它通过暴力传播，把受害者变成杀手。它的起源可能永远不会被发现，但Moonspeaker的故事和其他故事一样符合逻辑。狼人和移居者是相关的，因为第一个狼人是被诅咒的移居者。负责的未知力量很可能也是导致银色十字军的激增的幕后推手--而且它可能再次崛起。一个合理的竞争者是被称为 \"腐蚀者Dyrrn \"的daelkyr。据说Dyrrn通过扭曲变种人创造了二重身；它可能用同样的技术从变种人中创造了狼人。也可能是一个霸主的杰作，一个恶魔时代的大恶魔；一些文本中提到了 \"野心\"，一个破坏文明并以原始的残忍为食的霸主。最终，将由DM来决定是否会揭晓答案，如果是的话，答案是什么。在与下面的龙的邪教斗争中，你能否面对被Dyrrn腐蚀的原始变身者冠军？或者尘土领主的计划可能会释放出野性之心？",

But despite the stereotype, the shifters of the Towering Woods fear and fight evil lycanthropes, and their tribes include Monster Slayer rangers who specialize in hunting werewolves. Shifters and lycanthropes resemble one another, but they are not the same—and shifters are just as vulnerable to the curse of lycanthropy as humans are.": "虽然移居者和狼人并不一样，但故事和刻板印象已经很成熟了。每个人都把移位者称为 \"被动者\"。在高耸的森林之外，有许多移位者确实认为他们是薄血的狼人。而银色十字军和纯净火焰造成的创伤永远不会完全愈合。但是，尽管有这样的刻板印象，塔林的移居者还是惧怕和打击邪恶的狼人，他们的部落包括专门猎杀狼人的怪物杀手游侠。移居者和狼人彼此相似，但他们并不一样，移居者和人类一样容易受到狼人的诅咒。",
	"The {@class barbarian||Totem Warrior|totem warrior} barbarian and the {@class druid||Circle of the Shepherd|shepherd|XGE} druid are both strong choices for a shifter character. But how do the totem options overlap with your ties to the beast within? If you decide that you're a beasthide shifter with a Bear spirit, can you take Wolf as your Totem Spirit feature? Of course you can—even as a Totem Warrior, you're not bound to a single totemic beast. You could play up the idea that you feel a connection to multiple spirits. With your DM's approval, you could even have your character develop physical traits tied to your second spirit; you've always been a big, bearlike warrior, but now you manifest lupine ears and fangs when you shift.": "{@class barbarian||Totem Warrior|totem warrior}野蛮人和{@class druid||Circle of the Shepherd|shepherd|XGE}德鲁伊都是变异者角色的有力选择。但图腾的选择与你与野兽的关系是如何重叠的？如果你决定你是一个有熊精神的兽性变异者，你能把狼作为你的图腾精神特征吗？当然可以--即使作为图腾战士，你也不会被一个单一的图腾兽所束缚。你可以发挥你与多个精神有联系的想法。经DM批准，你甚至可以让你的角色发展出与你的第二种精神相关的身体特征；你一直是个大块头、像熊一样的战士，但现在你转变时表现出羽扇的耳朵和獠牙。",
	"Another option is to rename your class features to match your beast within. There's no reason you can't take the Bear option for the Totem Spirit feature but call it \"Boar\" instead. There is no Rat option for a Totem Warrior, but you could take the Eagle option and call it Rat. Ultimately this is a question of story. If you want to highlight your tie to a single spirit and it makes sense, just change the names. But there's nothing wrong with having a totem menagerie!": "另一个选择是重新命名你的阶级特征，以配合你内心的兽性。你没有理由不采用图腾精神特征的熊选项，而是将其称为 \"野猪\"。图腾战士没有 \"鼠 \"的选项，但你可以采用 \"鹰 \"的选项并称之为 \"鼠\"。归根结底，这是一个故事的问题。如果你想突出你与单一精神的联系，而且有意义，就改变名称。但是，拥有一个图腾动物群并没有什么不妥之处。",
	"As a warforged, your body was made in a Cannith forgehold. The creation forge wove rootlike muscles across a frame of metal and darkwood, bathing your body in alchemical fluids, giving you skin of steel or hardened leather. And then the miracle occurred: you came to life. You are made from wood and steel, but you are {@i alive}, aware, capable of feeling love and anger. You were born with an innate sense of your purpose, the knowledge of war burned into the back of your mind. But you aren't bound to follow the path that your creators planned for you. You have freedom. You have the ability to learn. Perhaps you even have a soul.": "作为一个战争锻造者，你的身体是在Cannith锻造厂制造的。锻造师在金属和黑木的框架上编织根状的肌肉，将你的身体浸泡在炼金术的液体中，使你拥有钢铁的皮肤或硬化的皮革。然后奇迹发生了：你活了过来。你是由木头和钢铁制成的，但你有（%0%），有意识，能够感受到爱和愤怒。你生来就有一种与生俱来的使命感，战争的知识烙印在你的脑海里。但你并没有被束缚在你的创造者为你规划的道路上。你有自由。你有学习的能力。也许你甚至有一个灵魂。",
	"As a warforged, you were created for a reason—what was it? How did you find a new purpose and become an adventurer? What do you want from life now? Are you concerned about the fate of the warforged as a species, or do you feel more of a kinship with your adventuring companions than you do with other warforged?": "作为一个战神，你被创造出来是有原因的，是什么原因呢？你是如何找到一个新的目标并成为一名冒险家的？你现在想从生活中得到什么？你是否关心战神这个物种的命运，或者你是否觉得与你的冒险伙伴之间的关系比与其他战神之间的关系更密切？",
	"The first warforged were built for battle. As Cannith refined its techniques, what started as simple infantry gave way to more sophisticated designs: lithe scouts with mithral plating, powerful juggernauts, even \"living wands\" wielding the power of sorcerers. As people grew more accustomed to these living constructs, Cannith began designing civilian warforged with a wide array of talents.": "第一批战争锻造者是为战斗而建造的。随着Cannith技术的完善，最初的简单步兵让位给了更复杂的设计：带有米塔尔合金镀层的轻巧侦察兵，强大的杂耍者，甚至是挥舞着巫师力量的 \"活魔杖\"。随着人们越来越习惯于这些活体建筑，坎尼斯开始设计具有广泛才能的民用战堡。",
	"As a warforged, you have the ability to learn, and your background and class features could reflect this. If you're a warforged bard, were you built to entertain, or were you created as a simple laborer only to discover remarkable talent within yourself? If you're a sorcerer, were you designed to channel arcane power, or is it an unexpected development? Determine your original purpose from the options below, then consider how it relates to who you are today.": "作为一个战神，你有学习的能力，你的背景和等级特征可以反映这一点。如果你是一个战神吟游诗人，你是为娱乐而生的，还是被创造为一个简单的工人，只是为了发现自己内在的非凡天赋？如果你是一个巫师，你是被设计来引导奥术力量的，还是一个意外的发展？从下面的选项中确定你最初的目的，然后考虑它与今天的你有什么关系。",
	"Like most warforged, you were designed to serve in the Last War. You didn't choose your side; you were sold to one of the Five Nations and set to work. You weren't taught to question this role—war was the only purpose you knew. Some warforged came to feel a patriotic attachment to the nation they served, despising the enemies they fought. Others felt a close bond to the officers and soldiers they served with, fighting for this \"family\" rather than for a nation. How about you? Which nation did you fight for? Do you consider yourself to be a Thrane or a Cyran, or do you have no love for the nation that bought you and threw you on the front lines?": "像大多数战争锻造者一样，你被设计为在最后的战争中服务。你没有选择自己的阵营；你被卖给了五国中的一个国家，并被安排去工作。你没有被教导去质疑这个角色--战争是你知道的唯一目的。一些战友对他们所服务的国家产生了爱国情怀，鄙视他们所战斗的敌人。其他人则对与他们一起服役的军官和士兵感到密切的联系，为这个 \"家庭 \"而不是为国家而战。你呢？你为哪个国家而战？你认为自己是瑟兰人还是锡兰人，或者你对收买你并把你扔到前线的国家没有爱？",
	"Warforged were in service for the last three decades of the war. How long did you serve? What was your most dramatic experience? Did combat leave you with lasting scars or damage, even if they have no mechanical effect on your character?": "Warforged在战争的最后三十年里一直在服役。你服役了多长时间？你最戏剧性的经历是什么？战斗是否给你留下了持久的伤痕或损害，即使它们对你的角色没有机械影响？",
	"For many warforged, class abilities reflect the role you played on the battlefield. As a fighter, you likely fought in the vanguard. As a ranger or rogue, you may have been designed as a scout. A barbarian's rage could reflect a \"battle mode\"—you don't actually get angry, but you temporarily increase your damage output and resistance. Class abilities gained over time could reflect an evolution of that design as you unlock your full potential—is this true for you, or are you developing unexpected talents?": "对于许多战神来说，等级能力反映了你在战场上扮演的角色。作为一个战士，你可能是在先锋队作战。作为一个游侠或无赖，你可能被设计成一个侦察兵。野蛮人的愤怒可能反映了一种 \"战斗模式\"--你实际上并不生气，但你会暂时增加你的伤害输出和抵抗。随着时间的推移而获得的等级能力可能反映了这种设计的演变，因为你释放了你的全部潜力--这对你来说是真的，或者你正在开发出意想不到的天赋？",
	"In the last decade of the Last War, Cannith began selling warforged to civilian organizations. This wasn't a common thing; a farmer couldn't just go to the shop and take a warforged home. But you could have served a dragonmarked house, been a bodyguard or a tutor for a noble family, or even been designed to serve as an enforcer for a criminal organization. This path provides a wide range of possible backgrounds and unusual stories. If you take the {@background noble} background, that doesn't mean you hold noble rank yourself—you could be a trusted bodyguard who's still treated as a member of the household. Perhaps a noble has made you their heir; such a thing would be unprecedented, but it would be an interesting story! With the {@background folk hero} background, you could have served as the protector of a particular village, with the story of your brave deeds spreading far and wide.": "在最后一次战争的最后十年里，坎尼斯开始向民间组织出售战争锻造者。这并不是一件常见的事情；一个农民不可能直接去商店把一个战锻人带回家。但你可以为一个有龙纹的家族服务，成为一个贵族家庭的保镖或导师，甚至被设计为犯罪组织的执行者。这条路提供了广泛的可能背景和不寻常的故事。如果你选择{@background noble}的背景，并不意味着你自己拥有贵族等级--你可能是一个值得信赖的保镖，仍然被当作家庭的一员。也许某个贵族让你成为他们的继承人；这样的事情是史无前例的，但这将是一个有趣的故事! 有了{@background folk hero}的背景，你可能担任过某个村庄的保护者，你的勇敢事迹会传得很远很远。",
	"As a civilian warforged, does your class reflect your original purpose, or have you risen beyond that? For example, you could take the {@background sage} background to reflect that you were designed to be a tutor or a researcher. You weren't built to be a wizard—but over the course of your career, you began to master the arcane, far exceeding the expectations of your creators.": "作为一个平民战神，你的等级是否反映了你最初的目的，或者你已经超越了这个目的？例如，你可以采用{@background sage}的背景来反映你被设计成一个导师或研究员。你并不是为了成为一个巫师，但在你的职业生涯中，你开始掌握了奥术，远远超过了你的创造者的期望。",
	"Warforged who served on the battlefield are forced to find a new life, because there is no war. As you weren't made for war, did the end of the war have a dramatic impact on you? The Treaty of Thronehold released you from any form of indenture, but do you still feel an attachment to your family or village? Did you ever have a sense of loyalty to a nation, or has your worldview always been shaped by the people you worked with?": "在战场上服役的战神被迫寻找新的生活，因为没有战争了。由于你不是为战争而生，战争的结束是否对你产生了巨大的影响？王权条约》使你摆脱了任何形式的契约，但你是否仍然对你的家庭或村庄感到依恋？你是否曾有过对一个国家的忠诚感，还是你的世界观一直是由与你一起工作的人塑造的？",
	"Battlefield warforged were largely mass produced. But there were many small runs of experimental warforged using specialized designs or experimental techniques. Perhaps your warforged rogue was part of a secret unit of assassins that were never deployed; how many others were in the unit, and what's become of them? As a warforged entertainer, were you built to be a superstar—and if so, how does House Phiarlan feel about that? As a druid, have you found a bond to the natural world within, or did an eccentric artificer design you with the potential to change shape and bond with natural creatures?": "战场上的战神基本上都是大规模生产的。但也有许多小规模的实验性战堡使用专门的设计或实验性技术。也许你的战争锻造的流氓是一个秘密的刺客单位的一部分，但从未被部署；有多少其他人在这个单位，他们变得怎么样了？作为一个战神的艺人，你是为了成为一个超级明星而生的吗？作为一个德鲁伊，你是否在内心深处找到了与自然世界的联系，或者是一个古怪的工匠设计了你，让你有可能改变形状并与自然生物结合？",
	"In developing an exotic warforged, talk with your DM to develop details about your creator and your purpose. Are you one of a kind or part of a small run? Do you know who built you and why, or is your true purpose a mystery even to you?": "在开发一个异国情调的战神时，要与你的DM交谈，以发展关于你的创造者和你的目的的细节。你是独一无二的还是属于小规模的？你知道是谁建造了你，为什么建造你，还是你的真正目的甚至对你来说都是个谜？",
	"Cannith artificers designed your body and made you for a purpose. When the creation forge imbued you with life, there were things you {@i knew}. If you were built to be a warrior, you knew how to wield a sword and pike. You had an instinctive sense of squad tactics. There were things Cannith instructors had to teach you, but even there, it felt almost as if they were reminding you of things you already knew.": "Cannith工匠们设计了你的身体，并为一个目的制造了你。当造物主把你的生命灌输给你的时候，就有了你的东西（%0%）。如果你是为了成为一名战士，你知道如何挥舞剑和长矛。你对小队的战术有一种本能的感觉。有些东西是坎尼斯教官必须教给你的，但即使在那里，感觉上也是他们在提醒你已经知道的东西。",
	"This is one of the mysteries of the warforged. Where does your sentience come from? Cannith gave direction, but they didn't design your mind; if they could, they'd have made you without emotion, and likely without the capacity for true independence. Many arcane scholars theorize that the creation forges don't create the warforged mind, but rather summon it. Some believe that the warforged soul is drawn from the planes, that a warforged soldier is infused with the essence of Shavarath. Others suggest that the creation forges could be recycling husks from Dolurrh... perhaps the reason you sometimes feel that you're remembering new skills is because you possessed those skills in a former life.": "这也是战神的奥秘之一。你的知觉从何而来？坎尼斯提供了方向，但他们并没有设计你的思想；如果他们可以，他们会让你没有情感，而且很可能没有真正的独立能力。许多奥术学者理论上认为，创造锻造并没有创造出战神的思想，而是将其召唤出来。有些人认为，战神的灵魂来自于各个星球，一个战神的士兵被注入了沙瓦拉斯的精华。还有人认为，创世锻工可能是来自多鲁尔的回收壳......也许你有时觉得你记住了新技能的原因是你在前世拥有这些技能。",
	"Regardless, your Cannith instructors taught you to focus solely on the purpose they gave you. They trained you to suppress emotions, to be a weapon or a tool. Now you are free, able to explore your full potential. What does this mean for you? You can feel a full range of emotions, but do you? Or are you mystified by anger and love? What do you actually care about? Do you feel loyalty to a particular person? To a nation? To the future of the warforged race? Some warforged revel in the ability to choose a new path; others hold fast to their original purpose, and just want a reason to put those skills to work.": "不管怎么说，你的坎尼斯教官教你只专注于他们赋予你的目的。他们训练你压制情绪，成为一种武器或工具。现在你是自由的，能够探索你的全部潜力。这对你意味着什么？你可以感受到全方位的情绪，但你会吗？还是你被愤怒和爱所迷惑？你真正关心的是什么？你对某一个人感到忠诚吗？对一个国家？对战神种族的未来？一些战神陶醉于选择新的道路的能力；另一些战神则坚守他们最初的目的，只是想找一个理由把这些技能用于工作。",
	"Warforged aren't machines; they're living, magical beings, and can evolve both physically and mentally. Just as you can learn new skills, your body can transform over time. This is one way to reflect class benefits; can you think of a way that your body could physically change to account for a new ability? If you gain the Defense Fighting Style, that might reflect your natural armor becoming thicker. If you're a warforged sorcerer, the ability to cast new spells could be reflected by arcane sigils appearing on your body, or by growing crystals that project light or energy. Never forget that you're the product of magic as well as science. You may be made of metal and leather, but you're also alive.": "战神不是机器；他们是活生生的魔法生物，可以在身体和精神上进行进化。就像你可以学习新的技能一样，你的身体可以随着时间的推移而改变。这是反映等级优势的一种方式；你能想到你的身体可以通过什么方式来改变，以适应新的能力吗？如果你获得了防御战斗风格，这可能反映出你的天然盔甲变得更厚。如果你是一个战神级的巫师，施展新法术的能力可以通过你身上出现的奥术符号来反映，或者通过生长出投射光或能量的晶体来反映。永远不要忘记，你是魔法和科学的产物。你可能是由金属和皮革制成的，但你也是活着的。",
	"As a warforged, your armor is a part of you. Your skin is metal or leather, physically bonded to the rootlike tendrils that serve as your muscles. While it is possible for you to change your armor, very few warforged actually ever do this. The process is similar to a human peeling off their skin; while it's not dangerous for the warforged, it's a disturbing and uncomfortable experience. As an adventuring warforged, it's an important ability to have, as it allows you to improve your defense and to make use of magical armor. But be aware of the weight of what you're doing when you exchange your armor.": "作为一个战争锻造者，你的盔甲是你的一部分。你的皮肤是金属或皮革，与作为你肌肉的根状卷须物理性地结合在一起。虽然你有可能改变你的盔甲，但很少有战神真正做到这一点。这个过程类似于人类剥去他们的皮肤；虽然这对战神来说并不危险，但这是个令人不安和不舒服的经历。作为一个冒险的战神，这是一个重要的能力，因为它可以让你提高你的防御力，并利用魔法盔甲。但在交换盔甲时要注意你所做的事情的重量。",
	"Once you have integrated a suit of armor, it cannot be removed against your will. However, you are still considered to be wearing armor for purposes of the Defense Fighting Style or other feats and benefits that relate to armor. Likewise, integrated armor can be targeted by magical effects. The Juggernaut Plating feat presented in chapter 6 enhances your integrated armor and protects it from hostile magic.": "一旦你整合了一套盔甲，它就不能违背你的意愿被移除。然而，就防御战斗风格或其他与盔甲有关的功绩和利益而言，你仍然被认为是穿着盔甲。同样地，整合后的盔甲可以被魔法效果所针对。第6章中介绍的Juggernaut Plating特技可以增强你的综合装甲，并保护它不受敌对魔法的影响。",
	"Just as a warforged can bond to armor or weapons, it's possible to attach a tool to its body. There are two ways to do this. The first is to acquire an {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}. As presented in chapter 7, this is a common magic item that requires attunement; through attuning the tool, you bond it to your body. An alternative is to take the {@feat Envoy Specialist|ExploringEberron} feat found in chapter 6. This gives you the benefit of an attached tool without requiring attunement.": "就像战神可以与盔甲或武器结合一样，也可以将工具附在其身上。有两种方法可以做到这一点。第一种是获得一个（%0%）。正如第七章所介绍的，这是一个需要调和的普通魔法物品；通过调和工具，你将它与你的身体结合起来。另一个选择是参加第六章中的（1%）壮举。这可以让你获得附加工具的好处，而不需要调和。",
	"Unlike an {@item armblade|ERLW}, an {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron} represents more than just having a hammer attached to your hand. Most tools don't represent one single object, but rather, a range of smaller items. How does this manifest with you? If you have a set of integrated thieves' tools, do you use your fingers as lockpicks? Or do you draw the various tools you need out of compartments in your forearm? If you have an integrated instrument, is it built into your arm or your torso? Whatever you decide, remember that you have to have a hand free in order to make use of an integrated tool. You can say that your bagpipes are built into your chest, but you still need a free hand to play them.": "与{@item armblade|ERLW}不同的是，{@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}代表的不仅仅是在你的手上有一把锤子。大多数工具并不代表一个单一的物体，而是代表一系列较小的物品。这在你身上是如何体现的？如果你有一套集成的盗贼工具，你是用你的手指作为开锁工具？还是从你前臂的夹层中抽出你需要的各种工具？如果你有一套综合工具，它是内置于你的手臂还是你的躯干？无论你做出什么决定，请记住，你必须有一只手空出来，才能利用综合工具。你可以说你的风笛是内置在你的胸部，但你仍然需要一只自由的手来演奏它。",
	"An {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron} can be an interesting part of a character concept that reflects the purpose a warforged was built for. A warforged outlander could have a set of cartographer's tools built into her body; she was designed to explore, using her integrated tools and innate sense of direction to constantly update her maps. A warforged entertainer with an integrated flute is a compelling image. In both cases, it's not that the warforged acquires the tool, but rather, it was part of their original design. If you have an interesting origin story, you can see if your DM will allow you to take a tool you possess at character generation as an {@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}. If not, integrated tools are common magic items and can be easily acquired over the course of your adventures.": "一个{@item integrated tool|ExploringEberron}可以是角色概念中一个有趣的部分，它反映了一个战神被建造的目的。一个被锻造的外乡人可以在她的身体里内置一套制图工具；她被设计用来探索，使用她的综合工具和天生的方向感来不断地更新她的地图。一个集成了笛子的战神艺人是一个引人注目的形象。在这两种情况下，并不是战神获得了这个工具，而是它是他们最初设计的一部分。如果你有一个有趣的起源故事，你可以看看你的管理员是否会允许你在角色生成时把你拥有的工具作为一个（%1%）。如果没有，综合工具是常见的魔法物品，可以在你的冒险过程中轻易获得。",
	"When creating a warforged character, a simple place to start is to ask: What did you do during the war? How have you changed since it ended? Did you choose the path you're on, or were you designed for it? Chapter 6 includes two new subclasses that a warforged could explore. The Living Weapon monk could be a warforged whose abilities reflect physical evolution combined with martial discipline. The Circle of the Forged is a druid path that lets you explore your connection to the natural world while remaining a creature of wood and stone. Here are a few other unusual concepts.": "当创建一个战友角色时，一个简单的开始是问：你在战争期间做了什么？战争结束后你有什么变化？是你选择了你现在的道路，还是你被设计成这样的？第六章包括两个新的子类，战神可以探索。活体武器僧侣可以是一个战争锻造者，他的能力反映了身体进化与武术纪律的结合。锻造之环是一个德鲁伊之路，让你在保持木石之躯的同时探索你与自然世界的联系。这里有一些其他不寻常的概念。",
	"You were made by human hands. There are many who believe that you have no soul, that you're just a tool. What would draw you to a religion and imbue you with the faith required to channel divine magic?

As a {@class cleric||Forge|forge|XGE} cleric, you might believe that the warforged weren't designed by a mortal mind; rather, Aaren d'Cannith was guided by divine inspiration to bring Onatar's children into the world.

Or do you believe that the warforged have their own divine purpose that has yet to be fulfilled?": "奥纳塔是锻造之主，是铁匠和工匠的守护者。作为一个{@class cleric||Forge|forge|XGE}牧师，你可能会相信，战神并不是由凡人的思想设计出来的；相反，阿伦-德-坎尼斯在神圣的灵感指引下，将奥纳塔的孩子带到了这个世界。你想把人类和战神带到一起，促进和平共处？或者你相信战神有他们自己的神圣目的，但尚未实现？",

Meanwhile, in the far northeast, a small but devoted following held to the teachings of the Blood of Vol.": "数百年来，主权宿主一直是加利法尔和五国的信仰基石。但几个世纪以来，裂缝开始形成。在瑟兰，一位年轻的圣骑士将这个国家从恶魔的统治中解救出来，并将她的胜利归功于一种古老的光明力量。她所拯救的人们很快就接受了银色火焰的信仰，并逐渐扩散到整个加利法尔。与此同时，在遥远的东北部，一个小而忠实的追随者坚持沃尔之血的教义。",
	"Some scholars say that the growing power of industry and arcane science weakened faith. Why should a blacksmith make an offering to Onatar when he could use his copper to take Cannith courses and learn {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron}? Others say that the Last War is to blame. Whatever the cause, there are certainly many in Khorvaire who have no deep devotion to any religion. None would deny that divine power exists, but in a world with sorcerers and dragonmarks, the ability to perform magic is no assurance of the existence of gods. But many faithful see no conflict between the wonders of the modern age and their devotions. Even House Cannith has always claimed to prosper through the blessing of Onatar, and there have always been those within the house who have asked the Traveler for dangerous inspiration. While the Mourning caused some people to question their beliefs, for others, their faith was the source of stability and comfort in a bleak world: {@i Whatever horrors we face, surely there is a reason for our suffering... a divine purpose we can't yet understand.}": "一些学者说，工业和神秘科学的力量不断增强，削弱了信仰。当一个铁匠可以用他的铜钱参加坎尼斯课程并学习时，他为什么要向奥纳塔提供祭品（%0%）？还有人说，最后的战争是罪魁祸首。不管是什么原因，在霍尔韦尔肯定有很多人对任何宗教都没有深刻的虔诚。没有人会否认神力的存在，但在一个有巫师和龙纹的世界里，施展魔法的能力并不能保证神的存在。但许多信徒认为现代的奇迹与他们的虔诚之间没有冲突。甚至坎尼斯家族也一直声称是通过奥纳塔的祝福而繁荣起来的，而且家族中一直有人向旅行者寻求危险的灵感。虽然哀伤使一些人对自己的信仰产生了怀疑，但对另一些人来说，他们的信仰是暗淡世界中稳定和安慰的来源：{@i Whatever horrors we face, surely there is a reason for our suffering... a divine purpose we can't yet understand.}",
	"This chapter examines the role of divine power in daily life and explores the differences between arcane and divine magic. It examines the three major religions of Khorvaire and delves into the occult mysteries of the cults of the Dragon Below. It concludes with revelations about the {@race aasimar|VGM} and their place in the world of Eberron.": "本章研究了神力在日常生活中的作用，并探讨了奥术和神术的区别。它研究了霍尔韦尔的三大宗教，并深入探讨了龙下的邪教的神秘之处。最后，它对{@race aasimar|VGM}和他们在Eberron世界中的地位进行了揭示。",
	"While scholars debate if the Sovereigns truly exist, the presence of divine forces can be felt in everyday life. This is more pronounced in specific places—Thrane, Aerenal, a Seeker community in Karrnath—but even on the cynical streets of Breland, you can consult an oracle of Aureon or get help from an exorcist of the Silver Flame. Similarly, people may criticize the actions of the Church of the Silver Flame, but no one doubts that the Flame itself exists, and everyone knows that its champions wield mystic power. Player characters are remarkable, and paladins are rare, but it's common knowledge that paladins exist. When a paladin heals a wounded soldier by laying on hands, it's impressive, but not unprecedented. How is divine power encountered in the world, and how does it differ from the magic of wizards and artificers?": "虽然学者们争论主权者是否真的存在，但在日常生活中可以感受到神性力量的存在。这在特定的地方更为明显--特拉恩、艾瑞纳、卡尔纳特的一个探索者社区--但即使是在布雷兰玩世不恭的街道上，你也可以咨询奥瑞恩的神谕或从银焰的驱魔人那里获得帮助。同样地，人们可能会批评银色火焰教会的行为，但没有人怀疑银色火焰本身的存在，而且每个人都知道它的拥护者拥有神秘的力量。玩家角色是了不起的，而圣骑士是罕见的，但圣骑士的存在是众所周知的。当一个圣骑士通过按手治疗一个受伤的士兵时，这令人印象深刻，但并不是前所未有的。神圣的力量在这个世界上是如何遇到的，它与巫师和工匠的魔法有什么不同？",
	"A cleric, a bard, and an artificer can all cast cure wounds. Working strictly by the rules, the only difference between the three characters is the spellcasting ability associated with each, so arcane and divine magic aren't concrete mechanical concepts. Rather, it is part of the story itself, with the artificer and cleric each doing something fundamentally different; the artificer creates a quick healing salve, while the cleric lays their hands on the victim and calls for a miracle. This section explores the difference between arcane and divine magic, suggesting flavor that you can employ in describing the actions of spellcasters.": "牧师、吟游诗人和工匠都可以施展治伤术。严格按照规则行事，这三个角色之间的唯一区别是与每个角色相关的施法能力，所以奥术和神术并不是具体的机械概念。相反，它是故事本身的一部分，工匠和牧师各自做着根本不同的事情；工匠创造了一种快速治疗的药膏，而牧师则将他们的手放在受害者身上，呼唤神迹。本节探讨了奥术和神术之间的区别，提出了你在描述施法者的行为时可以采用的风味。",
	"While much of this chapter is applicable to both players and DMs, some information lies ahead that isn't common knowledge to most player characters. Even characters with proficiency in Religion don't automatically know the deep lore of their faith; for example, most clerics devoted to the Blood of Vol don't know how Erandis Vol is connected to it. As a player, recognize that your character is unlikely to know all the things you're about to read, and work with your DM to determine how much they know about their religion and its secrets.": "虽然本章的大部分内容对玩家和DM都适用，但有些信息对大多数玩家角色来说并不是常识。即使是精通宗教的角色也不会自动知道他们信仰的深层传说；例如，大多数致力于沃尔之血的牧师不知道埃兰迪斯-沃尔是如何与之相连的。作为玩家，要认识到你的角色不可能知道你将要读到的所有东西，并与你的DM合作，确定他们对自己的宗教及其秘密了解多少。",
	"It's also important to note that the faiths of Eberron have been presented in different ways over the course of different books and editions of the game. As a DM, it's up to you to decide what's true in your campaign. And as a player, keep in mind that your DM may not take this book as gospel! This chapter is meant as a source of inspiration, not as absolute truth.": "同样重要的是要注意，在游戏的不同书籍和版本中，Eberron的信仰以不同的方式呈现。作为一个管理员，你要决定在你的活动中什么是真实的。而作为玩家，请记住，你的DM可能不会把这本书当作福音 本章是作为灵感的来源，而不是绝对真理。",
	"Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy—the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys—and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell—like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items—help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this is dangerous and exhausting; this is why most spellcasters are limited in how many spells they can cast each day.": "奥术魔法是一种科学形式。有可预测的规则来塑造现实，通过适当的学习和意志力，任何人都有可能施展奥术魔法。这就是奥术魔法成为五国文明基础的原因：它可以被教授，而且一旦学会，就完全可靠。奥术魔法涉及到引导周围的魔法能量--各星球的力量、西伯利亚之环的散发--并将其集中起来改变现实。咒语的组成部分--如口头咒语、身体手势和重点物品--有助于这一过程，但咒语最重要的元素是精神集中。尽管一个战士可以完美地复制一个巫师的语言和手势，但什么也不会发生。你必须在心中施法，驾驭和塑造神秘的能量，这很危险，也很累人；这就是为什么大多数施法者每天能施放的法术数量有限。",
	"All arcane magic consists of reliable skills you can master, but there are different forms of arcane magic. While a wizard and sorcerer can both cast fireball, there's a difference, tied to the ability associated with spellcasting.": "所有的奥术魔法都由你可以掌握的可靠技能组成，但有不同形式的奥术魔法。虽然魔法师和巫师都可以施放火球术，但还是有区别的，与施法的相关能力有关。",
	"Spellcasting using Intelligence is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation—harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you're looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you're doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you're a scientist.": "使用智力的施法是以知识和逻辑为基础的。对这些人物来说，施法就像解方程一样--利用并仔细引导所需的精确数量的神秘能量，以产生你所寻找的效果。巫师可以使用力量的语言和神秘的手势来产生力量，而工匠则依靠工具。但无论如何，你从根本上知道自己在做什么，这就是为什么工匠和巫师都可以每天准备新的法术。奥术魔法是一门科学，而你是一位科学家。",
	"Spellcasting using Charisma is tied to instinct and force of personality. For these characters, casting a spell is like knowing a few amazing family recipes even though you have no concept of the fundamental principles of baking. Your spellcasting talents may come from an arcane bloodline, a mystic patron, or a magical song. Regardless, you still have to perform similar actions to a wizard; to cast a {@spell fireball}, you still need somatic gestures and verbal incantations along with a ball of guano or an arcane focus. But you don't have to understand what you're doing the way a wizard does; you just know that if you follow the recipe, you'll get a perfect result.": "使用魅力的施法与本能和人格力量相联系。对这些人物来说，施法就像知道一些惊人的家庭食谱，尽管你对烘焙的基本原理没有概念。你的法术天赋可能来自于一个神秘的血统，一个神秘的赞助人，或者一首神奇的歌曲。不管怎么说，你仍然要执行与巫师类似的动作；要施放一个（%0%），你仍然需要身体的手势和口头的咒语，以及一个鸟粪球或一个奥术焦点。但你不必像巫师那样理解你在做什么；你只知道如果你按照配方，你会得到一个完美的结果。",
	"In general, wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, artificers, bards, wandslingers, and magewrights use arcane magic. This still leaves room for individual flavor, and the techniques of an Aereni wizard may look quite different from those of an Aundairian wandslinger. But the same basic science underlies them both, and the principles of verbal and somatic components are familiar, even if the precise gestures or words are different. You can decide your character breaks this tradition, but this doesn't change any mechanical rules. You might say that your bard uses divine magic to cast spells—singing prayers to the Sovereigns, for example. However, this won't change your spellcasting ability or allow you to use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, unless you make arrangements with your DM.": "一般来说，魔法师、巫师、术士、工匠、吟游诗人、魔杖手和魔法师都使用奥术魔法。这仍然为个人风格留下了空间，Aereni巫师的技术可能与Aundairian巫师的技术有很大不同。但它们都是以相同的基本科学为基础的，即使精确的手势或话语不同，但语言和肢体成分的原则是熟悉的。你可以决定你的角色打破这一传统，但这并不改变任何机械规则。你可以说你的吟游诗人使用神圣的魔法来施法--比如说，向君主祈祷。然而，这不会改变你的法术能力，也不允许你使用神圣的符号作为法术的焦点，除非你与你的DM作出安排。",
	"There's no logic to divine magic, no pure science that can explain exactly how it works. An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can't even read might feel Onatar's guiding hands and cast {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron}. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.": "神圣的魔法没有逻辑，没有纯粹的科学可以确切地解释它是如何运作的。一个圣徒可能会花数年时间冥想和祈祷，做善事，照看羊群，但仍然无法获得施法的力量；与此同时，一个甚至不识字的铁匠可能会感受到奥纳塔的指导之手并施法（%0%）。神圣的魔法需要两样东西：绝对的信仰和与神圣力量来源的联系。",
	"Faith is about conviction. It can't be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you're smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn't mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can't think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.": "信仰是关于信念的。它不可能是你理性地对待的东西。你需要从心底里知道，你想用咒语产生的魔法效果应该而且会发生。无论你是在打击敌人还是治疗盟友，你都知道敌人会倒下，你会拯救你的朋友。这并不意味着你必须是一个没有任何疑虑的狂热者；你可以质疑你的整体行动方案。但在施法的那一刻，你不能考虑你的疑虑；在那一瞬间，你必须有纯粹的、绝对的确定性，相信这个法术会实现的。",
	"But faith alone isn't enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist—if Onatar actually guides all artisans or if Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not Dol Arrah exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be Dol Arrah granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who's spent decades studying texts doesn't? People of faith usually respond that it's because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that's true, or maybe it's all just luck.": "但仅有信仰是不够的；你还需要与神力的来源有联系。在Eberron，没有人能够证明主权者或其他神灵是否存在--如果Onatar真的指导所有工匠，或者Dol Dorn和Dol Arrah是否真的看守着每个战场。但无论多尔-阿拉是否存在，当她的圣骑士击打敌人时，他们从某种东西中汲取了力量。圣骑士相信那是多尔-阿拉赫给予她的恩惠，也许是这样。或者，成千上万相信圣主的人的共同信仰在集体无意识中创造了力量之井，而圣骑士则从这种强大的力量中汲取了力量。在实际意义上，真相并不重要；无论其性质和来源如何，力量都存在。而这正是科学失败的地方。银色火焰是神圣力量的源泉，这股力量几千年来一直遏制着恶魔。那些寻求保护无辜者和打击超自然邪恶的人可以利用它的力量。但是，为什么一个圣殿骑士会成为圣骑士而不是另一个具有同等信仰的人？为什么一个不识字的农民能获得神圣魔法的天赋，而一个花了几十年时间研究文本的宗教学者却不能？有信仰的人通常会回答说，这是因为农夫被阿拉威选中，或者因为一个圣殿骑士比另一个更容易接受火焰之声。也许那是真的，也许这一切只是运气。",
	"As a paladin or cleric, you are tied to a source of divine power. Have you been chosen for a grand purpose? Did you earn this gift through piety or virtue? No one can prove the answer one way or the other. All that matters is that you have your faith, and that when you call for divine power, something answers.": "作为一名圣骑士或牧师，你与神圣力量的源泉紧密相连。你被选中是为了一个宏伟的目的吗？你是否通过虔诚或美德获得了这种天赋？没有人可以证明答案是这样或那样的。重要的是你有你的信仰，而且当你呼唤神力时，有东西回应。",
	"To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: \"Dol Arrah smite my foe!\" or \"Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!\" Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn't just ask for something; they reach out and {@i take} the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it'll be exhausted until they can rest.": "对外部观察者来说，神圣的魔法与奥术魔法的味道非常不同。巫师描画发光的符号，用比人类更古老的语言说话；牧师则只是戏剧性地指向他们的敌人，呼唤银色的火焰将他们击倒。然而，无论一个咒语是由奥术还是神力推动的，它仍然需要语言和身体的成分。实际上，这意味着施法者必须能够说话和使用他们的手，而且这些都与施法有某种联系。但是，当一个巫师可能背诵复杂的咒语时，神圣魔法的语言成分可能是最简单的祈祷。\"多尔-阿拉赫打倒我的敌人！\"或 \"在火焰的光芒中站起来！\" 或者它可能更复杂，也许是唱一首赞美诗或背诵一段古文。在这两种情况下，言语成分都是信念和意图的陈述。就像奥术魔法不仅仅是语言和手势一样，神圣的魔法也同样有精神成分。施法者不只是要求什么；他们伸出手来，从神圣的源头获得{@i take}的力量，如果他们过于依赖这种联系，它将被耗尽，直到他们可以休息。",
	"Mechanically, there's no difference between arcane magic and divine magic. But Eberron's divine magic is inherently more mysterious—it's not a science and shouldn't be entirely consistent or reliable. If you and your DM both agree to it, the DM could add some uncertainty to your divine magic. Consider a few ways this could manifest:": "从机制上讲，奥术魔法和神圣魔法之间没有区别。但是Eberron的神术本来就比较神秘--它不是一门科学，不应该完全一致或可靠。如果你和你的DM都同意，DM可以为你的神术添加一些不确定性。考虑一下这可能表现的几种方式。",
	"A spell could have a more powerful effect than you expected, as if cast with a spell slot of a higher level.": "一个法术可能具有比你预期的更强大的效果，就像用更高等级的法术槽施放一样。",
	"The target of a spell could gain advantage or disadvantage on a saving throw against it.": "咒语的目标可以在对它的救赎中获得优势或劣势。",
	"A target could be unexpectedly included or excluded from a spell effect.": "一个目标可能被意外地纳入或排除在法术效果之外。",
	"This uncertainty should never become commonplace. It's the sort of thing that might happen once or twice during an adventure, if at all, and it should never be something you demand. It's a way to add that sense that divine magic isn't logical—not to create a concrete advantage or disadvantage for divine casters.": "这种不确定性不应该成为普遍现象。这是一种在冒险中可能会发生一两次的事情，如果有的话，它不应该成为你要求的东西。这是一种增加神圣魔法不符合逻辑的感觉的方法，而不是为神圣施法者创造具体的优势或劣势。",
	"You should generally have a sense of why the uncertainty is happening. If you doubt the righteousness of your cause, it would make sense for you to have disadvantage on your attack roll; conversely, if you're a Silver Flame priest facing one of the Lords of Dust and you've just made an impassioned speech condemning them in the name of the Flame, you might expect a surge in power. But divine magic should never be entirely logical. If you cast {@spell flame strike} and one of the targets is entirely untouched, is it because your faith faltered, or could it be a sign that you are supposed to spare this person's life?": "一般来说，你应该对不确定性的发生有一种感觉。如果你怀疑自己事业的正义性，那么你在攻击卷上处于劣势也是合理的；反之，如果你是一个银焰牧师，面对尘土领主之一，而你刚刚以火焰的名义发表了慷慨激昂的演讲谴责他们，你可能会期待力量的激增。但神圣的魔法永远不应该是完全合乎逻辑的。如果你施放了{@spell flame strike}，而其中一个目标完全没有受到影响，这是因为你的信仰动摇了，还是可能是你应该饶恕这个人生命的迹象？",
	"As a divine caster, you are in touch with a divine power source. DMs can add a sense of mystery to divine magic by granting you divine visions. This might be clear and direct: during a long rest, you have a vision of a dark cloud over a nearby town. You know that evil forces are gathering there and that you have been charged to defend the townsfolk. This can be an easy way to set an adventure in motion. But it can also be more cryptic and intriguing: as your paladin enters the village, you see a burning crown floating above the head of a crippled beggar. The vision lasts an instant and is gone, with no further guidance. Is it a sign that the beggar is the rightful ruler and you should restore him to power? Is it a warning that he's an agent of Rak Tulkhesh? There is no clear answer; it's up to you to interpret it. The divine power is telling you something, but can your mortal mind make sense of it? As with unreliable magic, visions should be rare and remarkable. Such a vision is a reminder that you are in touch with a higher power, but you should never take this gift for granted or come to expect it.": "作为一个神圣的施法者，你与一个神圣的力量源泉相联系。管理员可以通过赋予你神圣的幻象来为神圣的魔法增加神秘感。这可能是清晰而直接的：在长时间的休息中，你看到了附近城镇上空的一片乌云。你知道邪恶势力正聚集在那里，而你被责成去保卫镇民。这可以是一个简单的方法来启动一个冒险。但它也可以更隐蔽、更耐人寻味：当你的圣骑士进入村庄时，你看到一个燃烧的王冠漂浮在一个跛脚的乞丐头上。这个异象持续了一瞬间就消失了，没有进一步的指引。这是否预示着这个乞丐是合法的统治者，你应该恢复他的权力？是警告他是拉克-图尔克什的代理人吗？没有明确的答案；这取决于你的解释。神圣的力量在告诉你一些事情，但你的凡人之心能理解它吗？就像不可靠的魔法一样，异象应该是罕见的、非凡的。这样的异象是提醒你与更高的力量接触，但你千万不要把这种天赋视为理所当然，或者来期待它。",
	"Divine magic and arcane magic are the two most common forms of spellcasting, but they're far from the only paths. Primal magic draws on the ambient power of the natural world, and is commonly used by druids and rangers. The verbal components of a primal spell might include a bird call or invocation of an animal spirit; somatic components might mimic the motion of a beast or spreading roots. Psionic magic uses the focused power of the mind, and chapter 2 includes suggestions for adding psionic flavor to kalashtar characters. A warlock might say that they are directly channeling their patron, acting simply as a vessel for that power.": "神圣魔法和奥术魔法是两种最常见的施法形式，但它们远不是唯一的途径。原始魔法借助于自然界的环境力量，通常由德鲁伊和游侠使用。原始法术的语言成分可能包括鸟叫或对动物精神的召唤；身体成分可能模仿野兽的运动或蔓延的根系。幻术使用的是心灵的集中力量，第二章包括为卡拉什塔人物增加幻术风味的建议。一个术士可能会说，他们是在直接引导他们的守护者，只是作为该力量的一个容器。",
	"Faith is a part of everyday life in the Five Nations. The people of Galifar were devoted to the Sovereign Host, and this echoes through its institutions—marriages are sanctified by Boldrei and judges swear oaths to Aureon. The Sovereign Aureon is the patron of wizards and magewrights, and Cannith artificers look to Onatar and the Traveler for inspiration. Many dragonmarked heirs assert that their marks are divine gifts.": "在五国，信仰是日常生活的一部分。加利法尔的人民献身于主宰者，这一点在其机构中得到了回响--婚姻由波德莱赋予神圣性，法官向奥里昂宣誓。主权者奥瑞恩是巫师和魔法师的守护神，坎尼斯的工匠们向奥纳塔和旅行者寻求灵感。许多有龙纹的继承人宣称他们的龙纹是神圣的礼物。",
	"So faith remains widespread, and there is no inherent clash between arcane and divine magic, but most commercial magical services are provided by arcane magewrights, not divine adepts. Priests can often cast {@spell thaumaturgy} or {@spell ceremony}, but rarely wield other forms of magic. The job of the priest is to provide spiritual guidance to their community; if you're looking to fix your injured leg, you go to a Jorasco healing house, not to a temple.": "所以信仰仍然很普遍，奥术和神术之间没有内在的冲突，但大多数商业魔法服务是由奥术师提供的，而不是神术师。牧师通常可以施展（%0%）或（%1%），但很少挥舞其他形式的魔法。牧师的工作是为他们的社区提供精神指导；如果你想修复你的伤腿，你会去Jorasco疗养院，而不是去寺庙。",
	"As a result, people are well aware of divine magic, but it's not taken for granted in the same way arcane magic is. The people of Eberron understand that divine magic isn't necessarily reliable, as discussed in the \"Gifts in Time of Need\" sidebar. A paladin player character will never lose their class abilities, but an NPC templar might gain divine power only when fighting supernatural evil and be unable to produce those effects at other times.": "因此，人们很清楚神圣的魔法，但它不像奥术魔法那样被认为是理所当然的。Eberron的人们明白，神圣的魔法不一定可靠，正如在 \"需要时的礼物 \"边栏中所讨论的。一个圣骑士角色永远不会失去他们的等级能力，但一个NPC圣殿骑士可能只有在与超自然的邪恶战斗时才能获得神力，而在其他时候则无法产生这些效果。",
	"People with the abilities of clerics and paladins are usually found serving as champions of their faiths. They are exorcists, templar commanders, inquisitors, and missionaries venturing into dangerous lands. You wouldn't just go into a temple of Boldrei and demand to be healed. Clerics and paladins are remarkable, and people will assume that you were given your powers for a special purpose. NPC clerics of Boldrei might be found operating charitable clinics or fighting outbreaks of plague.": "拥有牧师和圣骑士能力的人通常会被发现作为他们信仰的拥护者。他们是驱魔人、圣殿骑士团指挥官、审问者，以及进入危险地区的传教士。你不会随便进入波德莱的神庙，要求得到治疗。牧师和圣骑士都很了不起，人们会认为你被赋予了特殊的力量。波德莱的神职人员可能会被发现经营慈善诊所或对抗瘟疫的爆发。",
	"Long ago, a simple smith received Onatar's blessing, and from then on, found he could use divine magic to cast magecraft. When a gang of bandits threatened his village, the old man struck down the bandit leader, then smote those who didn't flee. He exclaimed that Dol Arrah and Boldrei empowered him to protect his people. But when the bandits fled, this strength left him and he died.": "很久以前，一个普通的铁匠得到了奥纳塔的祝福，从那时起，他发现自己可以用神力来施展魔法了。当一伙强盗威胁到他的村庄时，这位老人击倒了强盗首领，然后击倒了那些没有逃跑的人。他感叹道，多尔-阿拉和波德莱赋予他保护人民的权力。但当强盗们逃跑时，这种力量离开了他，他就死了。",
	"This is a typical folktale in the Five Nations. You can't choose to become a divine spellcaster; the power is given to you. While some say this proves the existence of divine intervention, others assert it's simply that deep devotion allows anyone to channel divine power under the right circumstances. In some cases, divine power can be temporarily granted by an immortal entity, as the paladin Tira Miron was strengthened in her battle against Bel Shalor by a couatl guardian.": "这是五国的一个典型的民间故事。你不能选择成为一个神圣的施法者；力量是给你的。虽然有人说这证明了神的干预的存在，但也有人断言这只是深层的奉献允许任何人在适当的情况下引导神的力量。在某些情况下，神力可以由一个不朽的实体暂时授予，就像圣骑士提拉-米隆在与贝尔-沙洛的战斗中被一个库阿特尔守护者加强。",
	"Player characters rarely have power stripped away; their core abilities should be reliable unless the player and DM agree to add uncertainty to their abilities. But NPCs could receive temporary divine gifts; the old smith described above could be a vital ally in a battle, but at the end of the adventure, his powers leave him. In the case of a player character, any character with faith could temporarily receive a boon (as presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) tied to a particular quest or purpose. That purpose might be made clear—gifted by a spiritual guide like Tira's couatl, or revealed in a divine vision—or it could be a mystery. Such a gift is temporary, and will be lost when it has served its purpose. This sort of gift should be especially rare and remarkable; Tira and the couatl is a legendary event, not something taken for granted. But it is something that can happen if it fits an adventure.": "玩家角色很少被剥夺力量；他们的核心能力应该是可靠的，除非玩家和DM同意给他们的能力增加不确定性。但NPC可以得到临时的神赐；上面描述的老铁匠可能是一场战斗中的重要盟友，但在冒险结束时，他的力量会离开他。在玩家角色的情况下，任何有信仰的角色都可以暂时得到一个与特定任务或目的相关的恩赐（如（%0%）中提出的）。这个目的可能是明确的--由像提拉的库阿特尔这样的精神向导赋予的，或者在一个神圣的愿景中揭示的，或者它可能是一个神秘的。这样的礼物是暂时的，当它完成了它的目的后就会失去。这种礼物应该是特别罕见和了不起的；提拉和库阿特尔是一个传奇性的事件，不是理所当然的事情。但是，如果符合冒险的要求，它是可以发生的。",
	"While it's rare to find people selling divine magic as a service, it's not unheard of. Breland is infamous for corruption, and an NPC cleric could demand gold for mystical assistance. Oracles of Aureon typically demand \"donations\" for their insights. And in places where faith is especially strong or widespread, adepts can be found providing services commonly performed by magewrights. In a Seeker community in Karrnath, you may find skeletons animated by the local priest tilling a field. A devout blacksmith might cast {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron} by calling on Onatar instead of learning it from Cannith—but unlike with arcane magic, this devout blacksmith can't teach the spell to an apprentice. Divine spellcasting is a gift, not a job; an apprentice might earn that gift with their own devotion, but it's never a sure thing.": "虽然很少发现有人把神圣的魔法作为一种服务来出售，但也不是没有。布雷兰因腐败而臭名昭著，一个NPC神职人员可能会要求以金币换取神秘援助。奥瑞恩的神职人员通常要求为他们的洞察力提供 \"捐赠\"。而在信仰特别强烈或普遍的地方，可以发现神职人员提供通常由魔法师执行的服务。在卡尔纳斯的一个探索者社区，你可能会发现当地的牧师在耕地时给骷髅赋予了生命。虔诚的铁匠可以通过呼唤奥纳塔而不是向坎尼斯学习来施展（%0%），但与奥术魔法不同的是，这个虔诚的铁匠不能将法术传授给学徒。神圣的法术是一种天赋，而不是一份工作；学徒可能会通过自己的虔诚赢得这种天赋，但这绝不是一件肯定的事。",
	"Within the Five Nations, Thrane is the greatest example of divine magic being worked into everyday life. Even there, Jorasco still provides healing and people rely on Sivis speaking stones to communicate. But in Flamekeep the streets are lit with silvery {@item everbright lantern|ERLW|everbright lanterns} created by adepts instead of artificers, and many other common services are provided by divine faith instead of arcane science. Beyond the Five Nations, the cultures of Aerenal and the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes use divine magic nearly as commonly as arcane services.": "在五国中，瑟兰是神圣的魔法被运用到日常生活中的最大例子。即使在那里，乔拉斯科仍然提供治疗，人们依靠西维斯说话的石头来交流。但在Flamekeep，街道上的灯光是由神职人员而不是工匠创造的银色（%0%），许多其他普通服务是由神圣的信仰而不是奥术科学提供的。在五国之外，阿伦纳的文化和恶魔荒原的加什卡拉兽人几乎和奥术服务一样普遍使用神术。",
	"Divine magic is real. For a player character, it's reliable, and under fifth edition rules, clerics and paladins don't risk losing their powers if their actions aren't perfectly aligned with their faith. As discussed in the \"What is Divine Magic\" section above, there are many ways to reflect the importance of faith and what makes playing a divine spellcaster feel distinctly different than playing a wizard.": "神圣的魔法是真实的。对于玩家角色来说，它是可靠的，而且根据第五版规则，如果牧师和圣骑士的行为与他们的信仰不完全一致，他们不会有失去力量的风险。正如上文 \"什么是神术 \"一节所讨论的，有许多方法可以反映出信仰的重要性，以及使扮演神术师与扮演巫师的感觉截然不同。",
	"But what happens when that faith falters? A DM and player could work together to reflect the evolution or even loss of faith by an equally dramatic mechanical change to a character. Consider a paladin who discovers or does something that deeply undermines their faith. If the character simply loses their class features, no one will have fun. But you could redesign the character as a fighter of the same level, reflecting the idea that their divine abilities are gone, but they're still a tough, hardbitten warrior. Or in reverse, you could start a campaign playing a fighter as a former paladin who lost your way; if you find redemption or new faith over the course of the campaign, you could eventually redesign the character to be a full paladin.": "但是，当这种信仰发生动摇时，会发生什么？管理员和玩家可以一起工作，通过对角色进行同样戏剧性的机械改变来反映信仰的演变或甚至丧失。考虑到一个圣骑士发现或做了一些严重破坏其信仰的事情。如果这个角色只是失去了他们的等级特征，那么没有人会觉得有趣。但你可以把这个角色重新设计为同一级别的战士，反映出他们的神力消失了，但他们仍然是一个强硬的、坚韧的战士。或者反过来说，你可以在战役开始时把一个战士扮演成一个迷失方向的前圣骑士；如果你在战役过程中找到救赎或新的信仰，你可以最终把这个角色重新设计成一个完整的圣骑士。",
	"Similarly, a character's beliefs might evolve rather than be lost entirely. Tira Miron began as a paladin of Dol Arrah but later embraced the Silver Flame. It's equally possible for a cleric of the Sovereign Host to have a journey that leads them to embrace the Blood of Vol; this sort of character evolution can be a remarkable story, and be reflected mechanically by the DM and player working together to swap their class archetype.": "同样地，一个角色的信仰可能会演变，而不是完全丧失。提拉-米隆一开始是多尔-阿拉的圣骑士，但后来拥抱了银色火焰。同样地，圣主教会的牧师也有可能经历一个导致他们接受沃尔之血的旅程；这种角色的演变可以是一个了不起的故事，并通过DM和玩家一起工作以交换他们的类别原型而在机械上得到反映。",
	"These mechanical changes might require some suspension of disbelief, as the paladin who becomes a fighter might suddenly be a significantly better fighter, and the cleric who swaps domains might lose proficiencies and have to throw away their armor. This is an imperfect process, and it's up to both player and DM to find ways to push past this and explain them within the story: {@i \"My armor was a prison. Now that I've embraced the light, I can't bear to carry the weight of war on my shoulders.\"} It's important to maintain game balance, even if it means overlooking a few blips in the story. But changing beliefs can be a good reason for a dramatic mechanical shift within a character. Ultimately, your beliefs—or lack thereof—don't have to be limited by a class choice you made at 1st level. Whether it's ultimately strengthened or abandoned, questioning and exploring faith can be an interesting path for any character.": "这些机械性的变化可能需要一些怀疑，因为变成战士的圣骑士可能会突然变成一个明显更好的战士，而换了领域的牧师可能会失去熟练度，不得不扔掉他们的盔甲。这是一个不完美的过程，要靠玩家和管理员找到方法来克服这个问题，并在故事中加以解释：（%0%）保持游戏平衡很重要，即使这意味着忽略故事中的一些小插曲。但是信仰的改变可以成为角色内部发生戏剧性机械变化的一个很好的理由。最终，你的信仰--或缺乏信仰--不必受你在第一级时所作的等级选择的限制。无论最终是加强还是放弃，对信仰的质疑和探索对任何角色来说都是一条有趣的道路。",
	"Eberron is just one bad day away from collapsing into a demonic apocalypse. The fiendish overlords struggle against their bonds, and shapeshifting rakshasa are manipulating humanity and working to release their masters. If you live in Khorvaire, you know as absolute fact that the dead can rise to prey on the living. You know that horrific aberrations could burst out of the underworld at any time and that the bite of a werewolf is all it would take to turn you into a murderous monster. The more you know, the worse it gets—even your dreams could be orchestrated by the Dreaming Dark. These things aren't questions of faith; these are simple facts. The overlords embody our worst fears. They thrive on hatred, cruelty, and chaos. Even when they're bound, they can use their influence to drive people toward darkness. And if they break their bonds, the world as you know it will be destroyed.": "Eberron只差一天就会崩溃成一个恶魔的启示。邪恶的霸主们在与他们的束缚作斗争，而变形罗刹正在操纵人类，努力释放他们的主人。如果你生活在霍尔韦尔，你就会知道一个绝对的事实，即死人可以复活来捕食活人。你知道可怕的反常现象随时可能从地下世界爆发出来，而且只要被狼人咬一口就能把你变成一个杀人的怪物。你知道得越多，情况就越糟糕--甚至你的梦都可能是由做梦的黑暗组织策划的。这些事情不是信仰的问题；这些是简单的事实。霸主们体现了我们最糟糕的恐惧。他们以仇恨、残忍和混乱为生。即使在他们被束缚的时候，他们也能利用他们的影响力将人们推向黑暗。如果他们打破束缚，你所知道的世界将被摧毁。",
	"These realities—and the need to protect the world from them—form the vital foundation of the Church of the Silver Flame. This is a world where deadly supernatural evil is a concrete fact of existence, and the church itself was founded when a noble paladin gave her life to pull her nation back from the abyss. Some might mistakenly see the church merely as a militant hierarchical religious organization and assume that it must be a force of oppression. But while the Church of the Silver Flame is a religion, it's equally a volunteer militia whose members are prepared to risk their lives to protect every innocent from the real and deadly threats lurking in the shadows. At the end of the day, the templar isn't there to tell you how you should live your life; they're there to make sure you can live your life, to protect you from the monsters and fiends that could appear at any moment.": "这些现实以及保护世界免受其害的需要构成了银焰教会的重要基础。在这个世界上，致命的超自然邪恶是一个具体存在的事实，而教会本身就是在一位高贵的圣骑士为把她的国家从深渊中拉回来而献出生命时建立的。有些人可能会误认为教会只是一个好战的等级制宗教组织，并认为它一定是一种压迫的力量。但是，虽然银焰教会是一种宗教，但它同样是一支志愿民兵，其成员准备冒着生命危险，保护每一个无辜者免受潜伏在阴影中的真实和致命的威胁。说到底，圣殿骑士不是来告诉你应该如何生活的；他们是来确保你能过上自己的生活，保护你免受随时可能出现的怪物和魔鬼的伤害。",
	"The Silver Flame was forged in the Age of Demons, and heroes of many cultures have wielded its power over the ages. The following principles form the common foundation of the Flame, regardless of whether you're a Ghaash'kala orc or a templar of Thrane—though extremist sects pick and choose which tenets to follow or discard. When dealing with followers of the Silver Flame, keep these in mind.": "银色火焰是在恶魔时代铸造的，许多文化中的英雄在过去的岁月中挥洒过它的力量。以下原则构成了银色火焰的共同基础，无论你是加什卡拉兽人还是瑟兰圣殿骑士--尽管极端教派会选择遵循或摒弃哪些信条。在与银色火焰的追随者打交道时，请牢记这些。",
	"The Silver Flame is a force created during the Age of Demons to bind the overlords. It has a concrete purpose: it is the cage that keeps apocalyptic evil at bay. The Sovereigns and Six are deities, believed to influence every facet of daily life. The Silver Flame is different. It's not seen as an anthropomorphic entity; rather, followers recognize it as a pure force of celestial energy. It doesn't influence the world on its own, and can only empower champions who will use that gift to protect the innocent. The Flame itself doesn't speak to people; instead, it is the Voice of the Flame that guides the faithful. Ultimately, the Silver Flame is a resource; if you seek to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, you may be able to draw on the power of the Flame to aid you in your fight.": "银色火焰是在恶魔时代创造的一种力量，用来束缚霸主。它有一个具体的目的：它是让世界末日的邪恶不受影响的牢笼。主权者和六人组是神灵，被认为影响着日常生活的每一个方面。银色火焰则不同。它不被看作是一个拟人化的实体；相反，信徒们承认它是一种纯粹的天体能量。它本身并不影响世界，只能赋予那些将使用这种天赋保护无辜者的冠军以力量。银色火焰本身并不与人交谈；相反，是银色火焰的声音在引导信徒。归根结底，银色火焰是一种资源；如果你想保护无辜者免受超自然的邪恶之害，你也许可以借助火焰的力量来帮助你战斗。",
	"The Silver Flame won't grant you a good harvest as Arawai will, nor will it send storms like the Devourer. The Silver Flame isn't a god, but a resource to serve a specific purpose, and there is no inherent conflict between the beliefs of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host. The Church of the Silver Flame is a practical, pragmatic faith founded on active public service. It takes the approach that the world will manage itself—that there will be a harvest or a storm whether or not you acknowledge Arawai or the Devourer—and that the most important thing is to protect people from the darkness that could destroy them. The church doesn't inherently challenge the worship of the Sovereigns, and the two faiths have coexisted peacefully throughout history. Paladins of Dol Arrah often coordinate with templars of the Silver Flame to deal with threats, and Vassals of the Sovereign Host are usually happy to accept the assistance of templars when danger strikes.": "银色火焰不会像阿拉威那样赐予你丰收，也不会像吞噬者那样发出风暴。银色火焰不是神，而是一种为特定目的服务的资源，银色火焰的信仰与主宰者的信仰之间没有内在的冲突。银色火焰教会是一种建立在积极的公共服务基础上的实际、务实的信仰。它采取的方法是，世界会自我管理--无论你是否承认阿拉威或吞噬者，都会有收获或风暴，最重要的是保护人们免受可能毁灭他们的黑暗。教会本质上并不挑战对圣主的崇拜，两种信仰在历史上一直和平共处。多尔-阿拉的圣骑士经常与银色火焰的圣殿骑士协调，以应对威胁，而当危险来临时，圣主的附庸通常乐意接受圣殿骑士的援助。",
	"The Silver Flame protects the entire world from the evil of the overlords, and likewise, those who channel its power should protect all innocents from supernatural threats. While extremist sects may stray from this path, the core beliefs of the Church of the Silver Flame don't elevate any nation or species above another. Templars of the Silver Flame should protect everyone from evil. Friars should guide and care for all who are in need.": "银色火焰保护整个世界免受霸主的邪恶之害，同样，那些引导银色火焰力量的人应该保护所有无辜者免受超自然的威胁。虽然极端教派可能会偏离这条道路，但银色火焰教会的核心信仰并没有将任何国家或物种提升到另一个国家或物种之上。银色火焰的圣殿骑士应该保护每个人免遭邪恶。修士们应该指导和照顾所有需要帮助的人。",
	"This principle was clearly evident during the Last War. Even when the Church took power in Thrane, most priests and templars in other nations continued to serve their people. Regardless of the position of the cardinals and the Keeper, the mission of the Flame is to defend the innocent, not to rule the world. Brelish and Cyran templars would quickly unite with Thranes if a supernatural threat arose in the midst of a conflict; if demons from Shavarath appeared on a battlefield, all templars would unite against them. But in the absence of supernatural evil, there's nothing preventing a templar from serving their nation or protecting their family. While the templars of Thrane are also the army of Thrane, they still recognize the difference between their sacred duty and their service to their nation.": "这一原则在最后的战争中得到了明显的体现。即使教会在瑟兰掌权，其他国家的大多数牧师和圣殿骑士也继续为他们的人民服务。无论红衣主教和守护者的立场如何，圣火的使命是捍卫无辜者，而不是统治世界。如果在冲突中出现了超自然的威胁，布雷利什和锡兰的圣殿骑士会迅速与瑟兰斯联合起来；如果来自沙瓦拉斯的恶魔出现在战场上，所有圣殿骑士会联合起来对付他们。但在没有超自然的邪恶的情况下，没有什么能阻止圣殿骑士为他们的国家服务或保护他们的家庭。虽然瑟兰的圣殿骑士也是瑟兰的军队，但他们仍然认识到他们的神圣职责和为国家服务之间的区别。",
	"The Silver Flame was kindled to bind the fiendish overlords, immortal spirits that cannot be destroyed. The overlords are the embodiments of hatred, fear, greed, cruelty—and, like the overlords themselves, these things can never be permanently destroyed, only held at bay. The message of the Silver Flame isn't that evil can ever be permanently eradicated. It is that we must be ever vigilant and prepared to deal with evil when it arises. Even in the most peaceful moments, a new terror could emerge from Khyber, or a gate could spill shadows out of Mabar. And even in a town of virtuous people, someone could be corrupted by greed or anger. The templar stands ever ready to fight the physical threat, while the minister seeks to keep their people on the virtuous path.": "银色火焰的点燃是为了束缚邪恶的霸主，这些不朽的精神是无法被摧毁的。霸主是仇恨、恐惧、贪婪、残忍的化身--就像霸主本身一样，这些东西永远无法被永久地摧毁，只能被遏制。银色火焰的信息并不是说邪恶可以被永久地消除。而是我们必须时刻保持警惕，准备在邪恶出现时加以应对。即使在最和平的时刻，新的恐怖也可能从开伯尔出现，或者一个门可能从马巴尔溢出阴影。即使是在一个充满美德的城镇，也可能有人被贪婪或愤怒所腐蚀。圣殿骑士随时准备与身体上的威胁作斗争，而部长则试图让他们的人民保持在美德的道路上。",
	"The basic doctrine of the Silver Flame doesn't promise punishment or paradise after death. But its faithful commonly believe that the souls of those who live virtuous lives pass through Dolurrh unharmed, merging with the Silver Flame itself. By strengthening the Flame, these souls continue to protect the innocent of generations to come. Merging with the Flame is generally depicted as a transcendent union with those who have gone before, a state beyond mortal understanding—seen both as a reward and a duty.": "银色火焰的基本教义并不承诺死后的惩罚或天堂。但它的信徒们普遍相信，那些过着美德生活的人的灵魂会毫发无损地通过多勒尔，与银色火焰本身融合。通过加强银色火焰，这些灵魂继续保护后代的无辜者。与银色火焰的融合通常被描述为与前人的超然结合，一种超越凡人理解的状态，既被视为一种奖励，也被视为一种责任。",
	"Typically, souls that merge with the Flame don't return to the mortal world. However, it is possible for a spirit within the Flame to maintain its identity, guiding or advising the faithful from beyond. The Church of the Silver Flame calls out Tira Miron as the Voice of the Flame, who stands between eternity and mortality and guides the faithful toward the light. However, the Ghaash'kala and the serpent cults existed long before the sacrifice of Tira Miron, and they have their own Voices of the Flame—heroes who guide the faithful of these cultures.": "通常情况下，与火焰融合的灵魂不会返回凡人世界。然而，火焰中的灵魂有可能保持其身份，从外面指导或建议信徒。银色火焰教会称提拉-米隆为火焰之声，他站在永恒和凡间之间，引导信徒走向光明。然而，在提拉-米隆牺牲之前，加什卡拉和大蛇教已经存在了很长时间，他们有自己的火焰之声--引导这些文化的信徒的英雄。",
	"The Silver Flame empowers mortals to fight against evil. But not all evils are equal, and different threats call for different approaches. The Church of the Silver Flame defines the hierarchy of evil as follows:": "银色火焰赋予了凡人对抗邪恶的力量。但并非所有的邪恶都是平等的，不同的威胁需要不同的方法。银色火焰教会对邪恶的等级定义如下。",
	"These are the children of Khyber, encompassing all manner of fiends and aberrations. These beings are fundamentally unnatural and innately malevolent; even their presence is seen as harmful to the world.": "这些人是开伯尔的孩子，包括各种形式的恶魔和畸形人。这些人从根本上说是不自然的，而且天生恶毒；甚至他们的存在也被视为对世界有害。",
	"These are beings once native to Eberron that have been corrupted by alien forces. Undead and lycanthropes are the most obvious examples of this category—innocent people transformed into monsters. Like the followers of the Undying Court, the Church of the Silver Flame maintains that undead are inherently unnatural and harm the living simply through their existence.": "这些人曾经是Eberron的本地人，但却被外来的力量所腐蚀。亡灵和狼人是这一类最明显的例子--无辜的人变成了怪物。与不死阁的追随者一样，银焰教会认为不死族本质上是不自然的，仅仅因为他们的存在就伤害了活人。",
	"This is the most contentious category on the list, and it is the idea of {@i monsters}—that there are creatures native to Eberron who are evil by nature. In the past, the church has placed medusas, harpies, trolls, and similar creatures into this category, asserting that through no fault of their own, these creatures are vessels for supernatural evil and pose a threat to the innocent.": "这是名单上最有争议的类别，它是{@i monsters}的想法--认为Eberron原生的生物本质上是邪恶的。在过去，教会将梅杜莎、女妖、巨魔和类似的生物归入这一类别，断言这些生物不是因为自己的过错，而是超自然的邪恶的容器，对无辜者构成威胁。",
	"This encompasses all humanoids who are born innocent but choose to follow an evil path. Because such beings aren't evil by nature, the goal of the faithful should always be to lead them back to the light.": "这包括所有生来无罪但选择走邪恶道路的人类。因为这样的生命本质上并不邪恶，所以信徒的目标应该始终是引导他们回归光明。",
	"Every follower of the Flame must recognize their own capacity for evil action; only through awareness can they guard against it. The Shadow in the Flame is always whispering, and it is arrogant and foolish to ignore that threat.": "每个火焰的追随者都必须认识到自己的邪恶行为能力；只有通过认识才能防范它。火焰中的阴影总是在低语，无视这种威胁是傲慢和愚蠢的。",
	"Entities of alien and unnatural evil must be fought with steel and spell. This is the purpose of the Silver Flame: to protect the innocent against these threats. When such forces arise, followers of the Silver Flame are expected to set aside any differences until the evil is defeated; this was seen in the Last War, where templars might serve different nations but would unite to deal with a supernatural threat. If it's possible to eradicate a threat without violence—such as curing a lycanthrope rather than killing it—that's acceptable, even laudable. But protection of the innocent should always be the primary concern, which is why the Silver Crusade focused on the eradication of the lycanthropes; the templars rarely had the resources to capture and cure lycanthropes.": "外来的和非自然的邪恶实体必须用钢铁和法术来对抗。这就是银色火焰的目的：保护无辜者免受这些威胁。当这种力量出现时，银色火焰的追随者被期望搁置任何分歧，直到邪恶被击败；这在最后的战争中可以看到，圣殿骑士可能服务于不同的国家，但会联合起来应对超自然的威胁。如果有可能在不使用暴力的情况下消除威胁--比如治疗狼人而不是杀死它--那是可以接受的，甚至是值得称赞的。但保护无辜者应该永远是首要考虑的问题，这就是为什么银色十字军的重点是消灭狼人；圣殿骑士团很少有资源来捕获和治疗狼人。",
	"The Silver Flame is tied to Eberron. If you worship the Flame and cast a spell that normally contacts or summons an extraplanar ally, you touch the power of the Flame itself. This could be a couatl, or you could speak to the Voice of the Silver Flame—the spirit of Tira Miron, though now that she is bound to the Silver Flame, she is far more than just a ghost. {@spell Conjure celestial} will usually summon a couatl, its essence drawn from the Silver Flame and given temporary existence until its task is done. {@spell Planar ally} can produce more powerful celestials, but these aren't called from another plane; while they may use the statistics of angels, they are formed from the pure light of the Flame itself and return to the Flame when their work is done.": "银色火焰与Eberron息息相关。如果你崇拜银焰，并施展一个通常会接触或召唤星外盟友的法术，你就会触及银焰本身的力量。这可能是一个库拉特尔，或者你可以与银色火焰的声音--提拉-米隆的灵魂对话，尽管现在她已经被银色火焰束缚住了，她远不止是一个幽灵。{@spell Conjure celestial}通常会召唤一个库拉特，它的精华来自银色火焰，在完成任务之前，它被赋予暂时的存在。(1%)可以产生更强大的天人，但这些天人不是从另一个位面召唤来的；虽然他们可能使用天使的统计数据，但他们是由火焰本身的纯光形成的，当他们的工作完成后，就会回到火焰中。",
	"With those who choose evil and those who fall prey to the evil within, the Church of the Silver Flame urges compassion over brutality. Templars take arms against unnatural evil, but it is the purpose of friars and ministers to guide mortals to the light. Innocents must always be protected from those who would harm them, but anyone who chooses evil could be convinced to choose good, and true followers of the Flame are encouraged to act with empathy and compassion for all natural creatures.": "对于那些选择邪恶的人和那些成为邪恶的牺牲品的人，银焰教会敦促人们以同情心对待残暴。圣殿骑士拿起武器反对非自然的邪恶，但修士和牧师的目的是引导凡人走向光明。必须始终保护无辜者不受伤害，但任何选择邪恶的人都可以被说服选择善良，银色火焰的真正追随者被鼓励以同情和怜悯之心对待所有自然生物。",
	"In the past, the church assumed that trolls, harpies, worgs, and similar creatures were innately evil, so templars eliminated these threats wherever they were encountered. With the rise of Droaam and House Tharashk's introduction of monstrous mercenaries, Khorvaire is learning that these creatures aren't any more inherently evil than humans or dwarves. Ultimately, it is up to the Keeper of the Flame to make rulings on these matters—much like a past Keeper's ruling that the deathless of Aerenal are not creatures of unnatural evil. In 992 YK, Keeper Lavira Tagor ruled that the church needed to reevaluate the classification of innate evil, and that templars should judge the actions of creatures in question and seek guidance from the Voice of the Flame. Since then, the Council of Cardinals has been debating the status of Droaam, but Keeper Daran has yet to make a final ruling on the matter.": "在过去，教会认为巨魔、哈皮斯、虫子和类似的生物是天生邪恶的，所以圣殿骑士在遇到这些威胁时都会将其消灭。随着德罗阿姆的崛起和塔拉什克家族对畸形雇佣兵的引进，霍尔韦尔正在学习这些生物并不比人类或矮人更本质上邪恶。最终，要由火焰守护者对这些问题做出裁决--就像过去的守护者裁决Aerenal的无死亡者不是非自然的邪恶生物一样。在992年，守护者拉维拉-塔戈尔裁定，教会需要重新评估先天邪恶的分类，圣殿骑士应该判断有问题的生物的行为，并寻求火焰之声的指导。从那时起，红衣主教会议一直在辩论德罗阿姆的地位，但守护者达兰还没有对此事做出最终裁决。",
	"The Ghaash'kala, serpent cults, and other paths have their own traditions, each with the same core principle—the Silver Flame is a tool that allows the virtuous to fight fiends and unnatural horrors. Though those paths may share similar beliefs, this particular hierarchy of evil is specifically defined by the Keeper and the doctrine of the Church of Thrane.": "加什卡拉（Ghaash'kala）、大蛇教和其他道路都有自己的传统，每一个都有相同的核心原则--银色火焰是一种工具，可以让有德行的人与恶魔和非自然的恐怖作斗争。虽然这些道路可能有类似的信仰，但这种特殊的邪恶等级制度是由守护者和瑟兰教会的教义特别定义的。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame represents just one path of the faith. It was built on the teachings of Tira Miron, but less than a year elapsed between her vision—leading her to embrace the Flame and rally an army—and her final sacrifice to defeat Bel Shalor. Thus, it wasn't her own words that established most of the church's traditions and doctrines, but the words of those who fought alongside her during that year. These were refined over time by priests who'd never met her—despite the passage of time, it's believed these priests were guided by the Voice in the Flame.": "银色火焰教会只是代表了信仰的一条道路。它建立在提拉-米隆的教义之上，但从她的愿景--导致她拥抱火焰并召集军队--到她为击败贝尔-沙洛而做出最后的牺牲，中间只隔了不到一年的时间。因此，确立教会大部分传统和教义的并不是她自己的言论，而是那些在那一年与她并肩作战的人的言论。随着时间的推移，这些话被那些从未见过她的祭司们提炼出来--尽管时间流逝，但人们相信这些祭司是由火焰中的声音引导的。",
	"The Keeper of the Flame is tied specifically to the official Church of the Silver Flame. The Keeper's power is based in Flamekeep, and the fountain of fire they keep marks the spot where Tira Miron gave her life to restore the bonds of the overlord Bel Shalor.

While it's a focal point where the Silver Flame's power bleeds into the world and a conduit for those who seek the guidance of the Voice of the Flame, the Silver Flame itself is far more than a spark in one cathedral—its power stretches across Eberron, binding overlords on every continent. The Church of the Silver Flame celebrates the Keeper of the Flame as being both the vessel of the Voice and the channel for the power of the Flame. However, the faithful of other cultures—such as the Ghaash'kala of the Demon Wastes—see the Keeper as a powerful priest and nothing more.": "火焰守护者与官方的银色火焰教会有特殊的联系。守护者的力量基于火焰之城，他们保存的火之泉标志着提拉-米隆为恢复霸主贝尔-沙洛的束缚而献出生命的地方。有些人错误地认为这个火泉（%0%）就是银色火焰。虽然它是银色火焰的力量渗入世界的焦点，也是那些寻求火焰之声指引的人的通道，但银色火焰本身远不止是一个大教堂里的火花--它的力量延伸到整个艾伯伦，束缚着每个大陆上的霸主。银色火焰教会颂扬火焰守护者，认为他既是声音的容器，又是火焰力量的通道。然而，其他文化的信徒--比如恶魔荒原的加什卡拉--将守护者视为一个强大的牧师，仅此而已。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame is largely willing to overlook the divergent beliefs of groups like the Ghaash'kala. In the church's eyes, these northern orcs are a curiosity and their unusual beliefs don't threaten the faithful of the Five Nations. Likewise, the Council of Cardinals has taken no action to suppress the extreme beliefs of the Pure Flame, even going so far as appointing the puritan Archbishop Dariznu as governor of Thaliost. In part, this is because the Pure Flame came into its own over the course of the Last War, and the cardinals of Thrane had little ability to enforce their will over the faithful of Aundair. Dariznu's appointment was an effort to ensure that the followers of the Pure Flame would accept the authority of Flamekeep. Despite the church thus far taking no action against the Pure Flame, Keeper Daran is deeply troubled by this sect and is considering the best way to address the problem.": "银焰教会在很大程度上愿意忽略像加什卡拉这样的团体的不同信仰。在教会眼中，这些北方兽人是一种好奇心，他们不寻常的信仰不会威胁到五国的信众。同样，红衣主教会议也没有采取任何行动来压制纯洁之火的极端信仰，甚至不惜任命清教徒大主教达里兹努为塔利奥斯特的长官。在某种程度上，这是因为 \"纯洁之火 \"在最后一次战争的过程中形成了自己的势力，而瑟兰的红衣主教们几乎没有能力对昂代尔的信徒们强制执行他们的意志。达里兹努的任命是为了确保纯洁之火的信徒接受火焰镇的权威。尽管教会至今没有对纯洁之火采取任何行动，但达兰守护者对这个教派深感不安，正在考虑解决这个问题的最佳方法。",
	"There have been times when heretical beliefs divided the church, the most infamous known as the Time of Two Keepers. In 497 YK, a peasant woman calling herself Melysse Miron challenged Keeper Kyra Danth for control of Flamekeep and the Church of the Silver Flame. Melysse claimed that Tira Miron had revealed she was Tira's direct descendant and the rightful Keeper. She challenged many church doctrines and claimed it had strayed from its path. And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame—it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn't killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.": "曾有过异端信仰分裂教会的时候，最臭名昭著的是 \"两个守护者的时代\"。公元497年，一个自称米利塞-米隆的农妇向守护者凯拉-丹斯挑战，争夺对火焰镇和银焰教会的控制权。梅利塞声称，提拉-米隆已经透露她是提拉的直系后裔，是合法的守护者。她挑战了许多教会的教义，并声称教会已经偏离了它的道路。和守护者丹斯一样，梅利塞也令人震惊地能够在火焰镇挥舞火泉的力量，创造出其他牧师无法比拟的奇迹。这引发了一场持续多年的深刻分裂，直到梅莉斯最终被揭露是火焰中的阴影所选中的手--不是银色火焰，而是霸主贝尔-沙洛，在火焰镇强化了她。由于担心她的死亡会让贝尔-沙洛选择新的反守卫者，梅莉斯没有被杀死；相反，她被石化并被安置在Dreadhold，直到今天她还在那里。",
	"More recently, the church was divided in 914 YK when Keeper Serrain was invested with temporal authority over the nation of Thrane. While many celebrated the idea of a kingdom founded on the noble principles of the church, there are many—even some in Thrane itself—who believe that investing cardinals and Keeper with political power distracts the church from its proper mission and serves as an invitation to corruption. This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn't rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain. In the wake of this division, Stormreach was formally severed from Flamekeep; it receives no support and Flamekeep doesn't acknowledge its priests within the church hierarchy. As such, Stormreach has become a haven for those who believe in the principles of the Flame but question its doctrine.": "最近，教会在914 YK时出现了分歧，当时守护者Serrain被赋予了对Thrane国家的临时权力。虽然许多人庆祝一个建立在教会崇高原则基础上的王国的想法，但也有许多人--甚至是瑟兰本身的一些人--认为赋予红衣主教和守护者以政治权力会使教会偏离其应有的使命，并成为腐败的诱因。这成为在最后一次战争中与瑟兰作战的外国圣殿骑士的理由；他们争辩说，他们继续尊重守护者的精神权威，但教会不应该统治一个重新统一的加利法尔。暴风城的牧师们甚至谴责神权和守护者瑟兰。在这次分裂之后，Stormreach正式与Flamekeep断绝关系；它没有得到任何支持，Flamekeep也不承认它的牧师在教会的等级制度中。因此，Stormreach已经成为那些相信火焰的原则但质疑其教义的人的天堂。",

According to the stories, Tira Miron foresaw the danger of the Shadow in the Flame. On the eve of her battle with Bel Shalor, Tira charged her trusted companion Samyr Kes to monitor the Church that was to come for signs of fiendish corruption—to save those who could be saved, and eliminate those who could not. Those who believe these tales say that it was agents of Miron's Tears who recognized the threat of Melysse Miron and exposed her as an agent of Bel Shalor.": "大多数人认为米隆之泪是一个城市传奇--一个深入银色火焰教会的间谍和刺客的秘密组织，甚至对守护者和红衣主教都是隐藏的。根据这些故事，提拉-米隆预见到了火焰中的阴影的危险。在她与贝尔-沙洛之战的前夕，蒂拉责成她信任的同伴萨米尔-凯斯监视即将到来的教会，寻找恶魔般的腐败迹象--拯救那些可以被拯救的人，消灭那些无法被拯救的人。那些相信这些传说的人说，是米隆之泪的代理人认识到了梅利塞-米隆的威胁，并揭露了她是贝尔-沙洛的代理人。",
	"It's up to the DM to decide if this order exists or if it died out long ago.

Virtuous player characters could be recruited into the order. Or chaos could ensue when an ally of the player characters—secretly a servant of the Lords of Dust—is targeted by the Tears.": "这要由DM来决定这个教团是否存在，或者它是否早已消亡。如果他还活着，萨米尔-凯斯--一个被火焰延长了长寿的精灵，可能会对现代教会的腐败感到厌恶。除了打击恶魔般的腐败，米隆的眼泪还可以针对布雷兰的贪婪牧师，打击昂代尔的纯洁火焰的极端主义，甚至寻求推翻瑟兰的神权，将其视为对教会的腐败影响。有德行的玩家角色可以被招募到这个组织中。或者，当玩家角色的盟友--秘密的尘土领主的仆人--被眼泪组织盯上时，混乱就会随之而来。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame has lofty aspirations, and it's easy to find fault when it fails to live up to them. While there's always potential for corruption in the church, it's often exaggerated.

Usually this reflects a fundamental lack of faith, and as a result, opportunists rarely wield divine magic. If an opportunist can channel the power of the Flame, it suggests that somehow, they are able to justify these conflicting concepts—that they truly believe their actions are righteous and serve the greater good, even if those actions incidentally line the pockets of the priest. Such a character might believe that they need greater wealth or influence to help others, or that they are fighting fire with fire—teaching the wicked the error of their ways through political or economic means.

This still requires deep faith, but the Tarnished are devoted to quite different principles. The most widespread form of this corruption is the cult of the Whispering Flame, described in the section on \"The Cults of the Dragon Below.\" But the Tarnished can also be loners who embrace the evil within alone.

Not everyone can live up to these ideals, and the Last War was an inherently violent time. But the faith still urges everyone to resist the evil within, and instead to embrace the virtues of generosity and compassion.": "一些基本信条指导着忠实的群众。作为一个农民，你可能没有力量与外来的邪恶作斗争，但你总是可以防范内心的邪恶，帮助你周围的人选择光明而不是黑暗。教会教义敦促信徒们以同情心和怜悯之心行事，设法理解你周围人的烦恼，减轻他们的负担，抵制以怒制怒，只有在万不得已时才求助于暴力。不是每个人都能达到这些理想，而最后的战争是一个固有的暴力时代。但信仰仍然敦促每个人抵制内心的邪恶，而是拥抱慷慨和同情的美德。",

	"This is the message of the Blood of Vol. Life is suffering and death is annihilation, but you can defy this cruel fate—and perhaps even break the cycle for good.": "这就是《沃尔之血》的信息。 生命是苦难，死亡是毁灭，但你可以藐视这种残酷的命运--甚至可能永远地打破这个循环。",
	"Most followers of the Blood of Vol identify as Seekers of the Divinity Within—usually shortened to Seekers—though there are other traditions within the faith. The Blood of Vol has long been vilified, with outsiders often viewing it as a death cult, falsely equating it with the cult of Katashka the Gatekeeper (described later in this chapter), or blaming its members for plagues and blights. In the midst of misinformation and fear, what is the truth of the Blood of Vol?": "大多数沃尔之血的追随者都认同 \"内在神性的探索者\"--通常简称为 \"探索者\"--尽管在这个信仰中还有其他传统。沃尔之血长期以来一直受到诋毁，外人往往将其视为死亡邪教，错误地将其与守门人卡塔什卡的邪教（本章后面会介绍）等同起来，或者将瘟疫和疾病归咎于其成员。在错误信息和恐惧中，沃尔之血的真相是什么？",
	"Human settlers to Khorvaire brought the faith of the Sovereign Host with them, but the Blood of Vol is indigenous to the continent. The line of Vol was a noble line of Aerenal, as described in chapter 2, with a long tradition of necromancy tracing its roots back to Xen'drik. When members of the line of Vol developed the dragonmark known as the Mark of Death, they undertook a risky series of experiments designed to unlock its full powers. This ended when the Undying Court and the dragons of Argonnessen joined forces to eradicate the bloodlines that carried the Mark of Death. In the aftermath of this brutal purge, those elves who had supported Vol but didn't bear its blood were given the choice of exile or swearing fealty to the Sibling Kings of Aerenal. This resulted in a wave of exiled elves settling in the Lhazaar Principalities and spreading west into the lands that are now Karrnath.": "来到霍尔韦尔的人类移民带来了主宰者的信仰，但沃尔之血是这片大陆的原住民。如第二章所述，沃尔家族是艾瑞纳的一个贵族家族，拥有悠久的死灵法术传统，其根源可追溯至Xen'drik。当沃尔家族的成员开发出被称为 \"死亡印记 \"的龙纹时，他们进行了一系列危险的实验，旨在释放其全部力量。当不死阁和阿贡纳森的龙们联合起来消灭携带死亡印记的血统时，这一切就结束了。在这场残酷的清洗之后，那些曾经支持沃尔但没有携带其血统的精灵被赋予了流放或向艾瑞纳尔的兄弟姐妹国王宣誓效忠的选择。这导致了一波被流放的精灵在拉扎尔公国定居，并向西扩展到现在的卡尔纳特的土地。",
	"These exiles brought the knowledge of necromancy along with stories of how the heroic family of Vol had sought to attain godhood, only to be destroyed by the jealous gods. The people of the region knew nothing of Aereni traditions or dragonmarks, and they blended this story with their own experience of life in a harsh land, local tyrants, and the empty promises of Sovereign priests. And in the process, they somehow discovered something real. The line of Vol had never sought the divinity within, but these first priests found it, drawing divine power from their own conviction and their own souls.": "这些流亡者带来了亡灵巫术的知识，同时也带来了沃尔的英雄家族如何寻求成神的故事，但却被嫉妒的诸神所毁灭。该地区的人们对Aereni的传统和龙纹一无所知，他们将这个故事与自己在严酷的土地上的生活经历、当地的暴君以及主权祭司的空洞承诺相融合。而在这个过程中，他们不知不觉发现了一些真实的东西。沃尔家族从未寻求过内在的神性，但这些第一批祭司找到了它，从他们自己的信念和自己的灵魂中汲取神力。",
	"So despite its name, the religion was never practiced by the line of Vol, nor by the infamous Erandis Vol herself, who was in hiding during the period in which the faith evolved. It is a faith born of the blending of elf and human myths and traditions. While the faithful believe that \"Vol\" was the first person to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality, the faith is based around the divinity within each of us, not the worship of this mythical Vol. Even devoted priests of Vol do not know Erandis Vol's identity, though they respect the name of \"Vol\" as author of their core texts, believing that this Vol challenged the Sovereigns, then was subsequently destroyed by these jealous gods—a martyr of the faith. Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all. So if Erandis Vol were to proclaim her true identity, many of the faithful would be impressed by her lineage, but her bloodline alone wouldn't give her divine authority.": "因此，尽管它的名字叫 \"沃尔\"，但这个宗教从来没有被沃尔一族奉为圭臬，也没有被臭名昭著的埃兰迪斯-沃尔本人奉为圭臬，她在这个信仰发展的时期一直在躲藏。它是一种由精灵和人类的神话和传统混合而成的信仰。虽然信徒们相信 \"沃尔 \"是第一个发现内在神性并挑战死亡诅咒的人，但这个信仰的基础是我们每个人内在的神性，而不是对这个神话中的沃尔的崇拜。 即使是沃尔的忠实牧师也不知道埃兰迪斯-沃尔的身份，尽管他们尊重 \"沃尔 \"的名字，认为他是他们核心文本的作者，认为这个沃尔挑战了主权者，随后被这些嫉妒的神消灭了，他是这个信仰的殉道者。现代探索者学者对这个名字的起源进行了辩论，沃尔是一个人还是一群人，或者与精灵系根本就有关系。因此，如果埃兰迪斯-沃尔宣布她的真实身份，许多信徒会被她的血统所打动，但仅凭她的血统并不能赋予她神圣的权力。",
	"Millennia ago, as the faith of the Blood of Vol emerged in pre-Galifar Khorvaire, it stood in opposition to the dominant beliefs and authorities of the time. The tyrannical leaders asserted that the Sovereigns blessed their bloodlines and their rule. By challenging the benevolence of the Sovereigns, these early Seekers were also challenging the despots of the time. As time marched on and those petty tyrants fell, the Sovereign Host remained the dominant faith of humanity in Khorvaire, and the philosophical divide between Seeker and Vassal only grew.": "几千年前，当沃尔之血的信仰在前加里法尔-霍尔韦尔出现时，它与当时的主流信仰和权威相对立。暴虐的领袖们宣称，君主保佑他们的血统和他们的统治。通过挑战君主的仁慈，这些早期探索者也在挑战当时的专制者。随着时间的推移和那些小暴君的倒台，主宰者仍然是霍尔韦尔人类的主导信仰，而探索者和附庸之间的哲学分歧只会越来越大。",
	"The Seekers were also shunned for their use of necromancy, generally considered taboo and said to be condemned by Aureon and Dol Arrah. This prejudice grew worse with the rise of Galifar and the Church of the Silver Flame, which asserted that undead are inherently anathema and drain the life from the world by their very existence. In turn, this caused people to blame plagues and blights on the Seekers. However, the Blood of Vol is a faith grounded in the principle of an oppressive universe, and it endured in spite of this prejudice and persecution. But it never spread far beyond the harsh lands where it began, and Seekers are often still met with fear and suspicion today.": "探寻者们也因为使用死灵法术而被回避，这通常被认为是禁忌，据说是被奥瑞恩和多尔-阿拉赫谴责的。这种偏见随着加利法尔和银焰教会的兴起而变得更加严重，银焰教会认为亡灵本身就是一种诅咒，它们的存在会消耗世界的生命。反过来，这也导致人们将瘟疫和瘟疫归咎于探索者。然而，沃尔之血是一种建立在压迫性宇宙原则基础上的信仰，尽管有这种偏见和迫害，它还是经久不衰。但它从未在它开始的那片严酷的土地上传播得很远，而且探索者今天仍然经常遇到恐惧和怀疑。",
	"The universe is against us, and all we have is each other.": "宇宙对我们不利，而我们所拥有的只是彼此。",
	"This is one of the most basic principles of the Blood of Vol. Despite its grim outlook, it is a faith that emphasizes the value of friendship, family, and community. There are no benevolent gods looking out for us, so we have to look out for each other. Death is the end, so we can't let it steal the people we care about without a fight. And since there is no pleasant afterlife waiting for us, we should treasure the time we have with those we love. These values have kept the Blood of Vol alive through the centuries: the deep commitment to community and to working together even in the face of impossible odds.": "这是《沃尔之血》最基本的原则之一。 尽管它的前景很严峻，但它是一种强调友谊、家庭和社区价值的信仰。没有仁慈的神灵在照顾我们，所以我们必须互相照顾。死亡就是结束，所以我们不能让它不顾一切地偷走我们关心的人。既然没有愉快的来世在等着我们，我们应该珍惜与我们所爱的人在一起的时间。这些价值观使沃尔之血在几个世纪以来一直保持着活力：对社区的深刻承诺，以及即使在面对不可能的困难时也要一起工作。",
	"Divinity lies within our blood.": "神性存在于我们的血液中。",
	"In the eyes of the Seeker, life and the soul are both divine forces. Every soul has the potential to evolve and develop divine power—but this takes time and willpower, and most mortals die before they accomplish it.": "在探索者的眼中，生命和灵魂都是神圣的力量。每个灵魂都有进化和发展神圣力量的潜力--但这需要时间和意志力，大多数凡人在完成之前就已经死亡。",
	"As a divine spellcaster who follows the Blood of Vol, you believe that your power comes from your own soul. As a paladin, you are calling on the power of your own blood when you heal your allies or smite your enemies. The visible manifestations of magic of the Blood of Vol typically involve crimson energy, as if luminous tendrils of blood are flowing from you. But it's not simply your power. Consider the Seeker priest who casts {@spell commune}; how can they gain information they don't already know? The answer is that the divinity within is something far greater than you. It is a god, possessing celestial power you can't understand or imagine—but it is still in its chrysalis, waiting to be born. When you cast your spell, you awaken a sliver of its power; once the spell is done, it returns to its rest.": "作为一个遵循沃尔之血的神圣施法者，你相信你的力量来自你自己的灵魂。作为一名圣骑士，当你治疗你的盟友或打击你的敌人时，你是在召唤你自己血液的力量。沃尔之血的魔法的可见表现通常涉及深红色的能量，就像发光的血卷从你身上流淌出来。但这不仅仅是你的力量。考虑到施展（%0%）的探索者牧师；他们怎么能获得他们不知道的信息？答案是，内在的神性是远比你更伟大的东西。它是一个神，拥有你无法理解或想象的天体力量--但它仍在蛹中，等待诞生。当你施法时，你唤醒了它的一丝力量；一旦施法完成，它就会回到它的休息状态。",
	"Or at least, that's what a Seeker believes. Scholars of other faiths argue that the Seekers are deluded, that their powers are simply drawn from some other source, the same kind of delusion that allows a warforged cleric to draw magic from their devotion to the Lord of Blades. However, Seeker priests can reverse this same argument. What proof is there that all clerics aren't simply drawing on their own divine sparks—that even a paladin of Dol Arrah mistakenly thinks their power come from above, when really, it's always come from within?": "或者至少，探索者是这么认为的。其他信仰的学者认为探索者是被欺骗了，他们的力量只是来自于其他的来源，就像让战神教士从对刀锋之主的奉献中汲取魔法的那种错觉一样。然而，探索者牧师也可以反驳这种说法。有什么证据表明所有的牧师都不是简单地从他们自己的神圣火花中汲取力量--即使是多尔-阿拉的圣骑士也会错误地认为他们的力量来自于上面，而实际上，它总是来自于内心？",
	"The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what's left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community—why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.": "沃尔之血是在与艾瑞尼死灵法师的合作中出现的，而亡灵一直与信仰有关。首先，也是最重要的，这种联系是出于实用性。探索者对尸体没有敬畏之心；内在的神性与生命和灵魂息息相关，一旦这些东西消失，剩下的就只是肉和骨头。作为这一点的延伸，大多数探索者希望他们的尸体能够被利用。这种信仰是由服务社会的理念驱动的--当你的尸体可以帮助你的朋友和家人时，为什么要让它被浪费掉？因此，无意识的亡灵经常出现在探索者社区，充当守护者，从事体力劳动，并完成其他简单的任务。",
	"However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years—but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.": "然而，一个常见的误解是，探索者想成为不死之身。有些人确实如此，纯粹是被遗忘的恐惧所驱使，但不死是一种悲惨的半衰期，而不是一种胜利。内在的神性与你的血液和灵魂结合在一起，所以探索者认为不死人的灵魂被困在他们的尸体中，神性的火花在他们身上消失。那些拥抱不死之身的人被视为殉道者，通常被期望保护和服务他们的探索者群体。这些冠军中最公开的一个是阿图尔的大祭司--木乃伊领主Malevanor。阿图尔的前任大祭司是木乃伊阿斯卡洛，他担任这个职位超过四百年，但他对长期的不死之身感到厌倦。当马勒瓦诺在最后一次战争中严重受伤时，阿斯卡洛尔将他的权力和他的不死之身转移给了他的徒弟。这提出了一个有趣的问题：如果内心的神性在于血液，那么马勒瓦诺是如何施展神性魔法的？答案是，探索者群体以仪式方式抽取他们的血液并与这些冠军分享。吸血鬼喝这种血，而木乃伊或地衣则可能用它来洗澡。通过这种方式，亡灵祭司从活着的信徒的血液中汲取力量。",
	"Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones—so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them.": "沃尔之血与亡灵魔法之间的长期联系的另一个因素是，探索者社区经常在马巴尔的显灵区或附近形成。虽然这些地区往往是荒凉或危险的，但在许多世纪的过程中，探索者们已经学会了如何利用这些地方的能量。因为马巴兰的显化区通常是枯萎的，所以外人常常指责探索者造成枯萎。实际上，探索者们经常举行仪式，限制显化区的负面影响--因此，他们没有造成与马巴相关的瘟疫和疾病，而是经常防止它们。",
	"If the power of the Blood of Vol flows from within, who answers when a cleric conjures a celestial or invokes {@spell planar ally}? One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it's a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for {@spell planar ally}, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious—a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you've been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don't fully understand what it needs or wants.": "如果沃尔之血的力量从内部流淌出来，那么当牧师召唤出天人或召唤出（%0%）时，谁来回答？一个简单的答案是，DM可以使用一个具有天人或恶魔的统计资料的生命，但它是由血液和魔法形成的；它是你自己的神性本质的表现，当它的工作完成后就会消失。这对于{@spell planar ally}这个通常需要向外部力量付款的法术来说似乎是个奇怪的搭配，但即使是你自己本质的盟友也可能要求提供服务作为回报。这可以看作是来自你潜意识的要求--要求你做一些你知道你应该做，但你一直试图忽视的事情。另一方面，它可能是一个没有明显目的的神秘任务；这与你的内在神性是超越凡人理解的东西这一事实有关，你并不完全了解它需要或想要什么。",
	"Another possibility is that you're drawing on the Seeker community rather than reaching to the planes for assistance. One principle of the faith is that champions become undead so that they can help other Seekers. When you cast {@spell planar ally}, rather than calling a celestial or fiend, you might summon an undead champion of your faith; this could be anything from a vampire to a mummy lord or a death knight. In this case, the payment they demand for their service would likely be a tithe to the Seeker temple they are bound to. On a smaller scale, your DM could similarly decide that when you cast {@spell conjure celestial}, it summons a sarcastic flameskull instead of an angel.": "另一种可能性是，你在利用探索者群体，而不是向各星球寻求援助。信仰的一个原则是，冠军会变成不死之身，以便他们能帮助其他探索者。当你施展{@spell planar ally}时，你可能会召唤一个你信仰的不死战士，而不是召唤一个天神或魔鬼；这可能是任何东西，从吸血鬼到木乃伊领主或死亡骑士。在这种情况下，他们要求的报酬很可能是对他们所隶属的探索者神庙的什一税。在一个较小的范围内，你的管理员也可以决定，当你施放{@spell conjure celestial}时，它会召唤出一个讽刺的火焰骷髅，而不是一个天使。",
	"Throughout its history, the Blood of Vol has been treated with fear and suspicion by the people of the Five Nations. It's a faith that has dwelled in the shadows. This changed early in the Last War. His nation crippled by famine, King Kaius I accepted the aid of the Blood of Vol. The Seekers provided undead soldiers and necromantic expertise; with the resources of the crown behind them, Seekers developed necromantic rituals and weapons never before imagined. In exchange, Kaius elevated the Blood of Vol to the official state religion. Warlords were encouraged to embrace the faith, and Seeker families were given lands and titles.": "纵观其历史，沃尔之血一直被五国人民以恐惧和怀疑的态度对待。它是一种居住在阴影中的信仰。这种情况在最后一次战争初期发生了变化。寻求者提供了不死的士兵和亡灵魔法知识；在王室资源的支持下，寻求者开发了前所未有的亡灵魔法仪式和武器。作为交换，凯厄斯将沃尔之血提升为官方国教。军阀们被鼓励接受这一信仰，而探索者家族则获得了土地和称号。",
	"For a time, the Blood of Vol spread and was celebrated—or so it seemed. Most of the old warlord families still despised the Seekers and felt that the use of undead in battle debased the proud martial traditions of their ancestors. Toward the end of the war, Regent Moranna turned on the faith and the Blood of Vol became a scapegoat for all of Karrnath's troubles. Moranna claimed that the famines and plagues the people had suffered were caused by the Seekers. Its nobles were stripped of their lands. Chivalric orders of Seekers were disbanded. Some—notably the infamous Order of the Emerald Claw—refused to surrender, but most Seekers remained loyal to their nation even when it betrayed them.": "一时间，沃尔之血流传开来，受到人们的赞誉--或者说，看起来是这样。大多数老牌军阀家族仍然鄙视探索者，认为在战斗中使用不死生物贬低了他们祖先引以为豪的武术传统。在战争即将结束时，摄政王莫兰娜背叛了信仰，沃尔之血成为卡尔纳特所有问题的替罪羊。莫兰娜声称，人们遭受的饥荒和瘟疫是由探索者造成的。贵族们的土地被剥夺了。探索者的骑士团被解散了。有些人--特别是臭名昭著的翡翠之爪骑士团--拒绝投降，但大多数探索者仍然忠于他们的国家，即使他们背叛了他们。",
	"Today, the Blood of Vol has returned to the shadows, though there are still Seekers who serve the crown. Kaius III has sealed most of his undead forces in the crypts below Korth and Atur, but he isn't willing to entirely surrender this strategic advantage. Fort Bones and Fort Zombie remain bastions of loyal Seekers. But the faith is no longer celebrated, and the old warlord lines still mutter that they would have won the war if only they'd relied on skill and steel instead of foul magics. In playing a Karrnathi Seeker, do you support the crown and believe that Kaius III is only doing what he has to do to maintain the support of the warlords, or do you despise Kaius III and Moranna for betraying your faith?": "今天，沃尔之血已经回到了阴影中，尽管仍有为王室服务的探索者。凯乌斯三世将他的大部分亡灵部队封存在科思和阿图尔下面的地窖里，但他并不愿意完全放弃这一战略优势。骨头堡和僵尸堡仍然是忠诚的探索者们的堡垒。但信仰不再被颂扬，老军阀们还在嘀咕，只要他们依靠技巧和钢铁而不是肮脏的魔法，就能赢得战争。在扮演卡尔纳特探索者时，你是支持王室，相信凯乌斯三世只是为了维持军阀们的支持而做他必须做的事，还是鄙视凯乌斯三世和莫兰娜背叛了你的信仰？",
	"When creating a player character or NPC associated with the Blood of Vol, consider the following paths and which best fits your character.": "在创建与沃尔之血有关的玩家角色或NPC时，请考虑以下路径，以及哪条路径最适合你的角色。",
	"The Seekers of the Divinity Within are the largest and most widespread tradition associated with the Blood of Vol. The faith isn't as formally structured as the Church of the Silver Flame or even the Sovereign Host. For the most part, Seekers keep to themselves, living in their own villages and small towns or in isolated neighborhoods of larger communities, where they can practice their traditions without drawing the ire of their neighbors. The exception is the city of Atur: known as the City of Night, this remains the most public bastion of the Blood of Vol. Expanded and fortified during the Last War, Atur is the seat of Karrnath's necromantic research and development. While Kaius III has stripped the Blood of Vol of much of its standing, he still recognizes its potential value should the war begin anew, and many believe that he continues to provide support to Atur. The mummy lord Hass Malevanor is the high priest of Atur and the current spiritual leader of the faith. However, there are stories of undead champions who have guided and protected the Seekers for centuries. Sometimes known as the Crimson Covenant, these enigmatic figures may be the true power behind Atur.": "内在神性的探索者是与沃尔之血有关的最大和最广泛的传统。在大多数情况下，探索者们独来独往，住在自己的村庄和小镇上，或者住在大社区的偏僻街区，在那里他们可以实践自己的传统，而不会引起邻居们的愤怒。阿图尔城是个例外：它被称为 \"夜之城\"，仍然是沃尔之血最公开的堡垒。虽然凯乌斯三世已经剥夺了沃尔之血的大部分地位，但他仍然认识到，如果战争重新开始，它的潜在价值，而且许多人认为他继续向阿图尔提供支持。木乃伊领主哈斯-马勒瓦诺是阿图尔的大祭司，也是目前该信仰的精神领袖。然而，有一些关于亡灵冠军的故事，他们几个世纪以来一直在指导和保护探索者。这些神秘的人物有时被称为深红盟约，他们可能是阿图尔背后的真正力量。",
	"Outside Atur, for the most part, each Seeker community relies on their abactor—the priest that oversees a temple or community—and they rarely reach out to the world beyond. The largest temple in a region serves as a hub, coordinating with the other Seeker communities around it. But every community has its own stories and traditions and they're generally unconcerned with \"heresy\"; feel free to develop your character's own unique beliefs.": "在阿图尔之外，大部分情况下，每个探索者社区都依靠他们的守护者--监督寺庙或社区的牧师--他们很少接触到外面的世界。一个地区最大的寺庙是一个枢纽，与周围的其他探索者社区进行协调。但每个社区都有自己的故事和传统，他们一般不关心 \"异端\"；请自由发展你的角色的独特信仰。",
	"As an acolyte of the Blood of Vol, you've been ordained as a priest, but not bound to a single community as an abactor. You can receive shelter in any Seeker community. Are you following orders from Malevanor or the Crimson Covenant itself? Are you guided by visions from your own divinity within? As a Seeker hermit, you spent your time in isolation communing with your divinity within, and your Discovery may relate to the faith. Perhaps you have an insight into how to unlock your own power. Or perhaps you've learned a secret about the Crimson Covenant, and believe that a malevolent force is manipulating the faithful Seekers—can you find a way to bring down this ancient evil and free your people?": "作为沃尔之血的圣徒，你已经被任命为牧师，但不像修道者那样被约束在一个社区。你可以在任何一个探索者社区接受庇护。你是否听从玛勒瓦诺或深红圣约本身的命令？你是否被你自己内在的神性的幻象所指引？作为一个探索者隐士，你在与世隔绝的时间里与你内在的神性交流，而你的发现可能与信仰有关。也许你对如何释放你自己的力量有一种洞察力。或者你已经了解了一个关于深红盟约的秘密，并且相信有一股邪恶的力量正在操纵忠实的探索者--你能找到一种方法来打倒这个古老的邪恶并解放你的人民吗？",
	"The elves of the Bloodsail Principality occupy the island of Farlnen in the Lhazaar Principalities. The Bloodsails share the same roots as the Blood of Vol, as the principality was founded by Aereni exiles. However, they have followed a different path and hewn closer to the traditions of their ancestors. They don't believe in the divinity within and readily seek immortality through undeath. However, the island can only support a limited number of vampires, and Bloodsails must earn their afterlife by paying {@i velgys}—blood money—to the lords of the land. Those who fail to earn enough to buy a better afterlife are instead bound to objects after death. This is similar to the Aereni techniques described in chapter 2, but Bloodsail elves are often tied to ships and sails, enabling their vessels to move across a windless sea, sails driven by ghosts.": "血帆公国的精灵们占据着拉扎尔公国中的法尔宁岛。血帆公国与沃尔之血同根同源，因为该公国是由艾瑞尼的流亡者建立的。然而，他们走的是一条不同的道路，更接近于他们祖先的传统。他们不相信内在的神性，而是轻易地通过不死来寻求不朽。然而，这个岛屿只能支持有限数量的吸血鬼，血帆必须通过向土地的领主支付{@i velgys}--血钱来获得他们的来世。那些没能赚到足够的钱来买到更好的来世的人，死后反而会被束缚在物体上。这与第二章中描述的Aereni技术相似，但血帆精灵通常被绑在船和帆上，使他们的船只能够在无风的海上行驶，帆由鬼魂驱动。",

	"The Order of the Emerald Claw began as an elite military force comprised of devoted Seekers. When Regent Moranna turned on the Blood of Vol, the Emerald Claw refused to stand down. Today, members of the order include both Seeker extremists and Karrnathi patriots furious at Kaius III for embracing peace. The ultimate leader of the Emerald Claw is the lich known to most as the Queen of the Dead, though those in the inner circle know her to be the infamous Lady Illmarrow of Farlnen. She claims that her violent actions are for the good of Karrnath and the Blood of Vol, but in truth, they primarily benefit her and serve to spread terror.": "翡翠之爪骑士团最初是一支由忠诚的探索者组成的精英军事力量。当摄政王莫兰娜背叛沃尔之血时，翡翠之爪拒绝退缩。今天，该组织的成员包括探索者的极端分子和对凯厄斯三世拥抱和平感到愤怒的卡尔纳提爱国者。翡翠之爪的最终领导者是被大多数人称为 \"死亡女王 \"的巫师，但内部人员知道她是臭名昭著的法尔南的伊尔马罗女士。她声称她的暴力行动是为了卡尔纳特和沃尔之血的利益，但事实上，这些行动主要是为了让她自己受益，并用于传播恐怖。",

Or do you believe Kaius III is a traitor to your people?": "如果你想扮演一个没有翡翠之爪的反派关系的探索者老兵，玛瑙头骨骑士团是另一支由探索者组成的精英部队，但在莫兰娜的命令下解散了。作为沃尔之血的圣骑士，你可能是玛瑙头骨的一名骑士，在被国家抛弃后开始了冒险之旅。你是否仍然忠于卡尔纳特？或者你认为凯厄斯三世是你们民族的叛徒？",
	"The Seekers of the Divinity Within value community, urging the faithful to stand together. But there are others who follow the principles of the Blood of Vol who prefer to stand alone. The hermits known as Thieves of Life are determined to unlock their divinity within at any cost—not to help others, but solely to further their own quest for power and immortality. Thieves of Life are often master necromancers, but never become undead themselves; instead, they specialize in magics that allow them to drain the life from their foes.": "内部神性的探索者重视社区，敦促信徒们站在一起。但也有一些遵循沃尔之血原则的人喜欢独善其身。被称为 \"生命之贼 \"的隐士们决心不惜一切代价解开他们内在的神性--不是为了帮助别人，而只是为了促进他们自己对权力和不朽的追求。生命之贼通常是死灵法师，但自己从不成为不死之身；相反，他们擅长的魔法可以让他们吸干敌人的生命。",
	"As a hermit devoted to the Blood of Vol, you could choose the path of the Thief of Life. You are utterly devoted to the pursuit of your personal divinity, and your Discovery has likely shown you the path you must take. You might be a cleric, a Divine Soul sorcerer, or an Undying warlock (with your patron being your own nascent divinity within).

You may be utterly devoted to your quest for immortality—but what is your redeeming feature, your anchor to humanity?": "作为一个致力于沃尔之血的隐士，你可以选择 \"生命之贼 \"的道路。你完全致力于追求你个人的神性，而你的发现者很可能已经向你指明了你必须走的道路。你可能是一个牧师，一个神魂法师，或者是一个不死的术士（你的守护者是你自己内心新生的神性）。是什么将你和你的同伴联系在一起，他们为什么会选择与你交往？你可能完全献身于你对不朽的追求--但什么是你的救赎特征，你对人类的锚？",
	"An unusual option for a Thief of Life hermit is to say that you've actually been in a state of suspended animation for decades or even centuries—your Discovery was made on an inner journey. You were once far more powerful than you are today, but your powers have yet to return; as you gain levels, you are actually regaining the power you once had. If this is the case, it could be that one or more of your adventuring companions are actually descendants of yours; while you're obsessed with your quest for immortality, you also care about your own bloodline.": "对于生命之贼的隐士来说，一个不寻常的选择是说你实际上已经处于悬浮状态几十年甚至几个世纪了--你的发现是在一次内在旅行中做出的。你曾经比现在强大得多，但你的力量还没有恢复；随着你等级的提高，你实际上正在恢复你曾经拥有的力量。如果是这种情况，可能你的一个或多个冒险同伴实际上是你的后裔；当你沉迷于对不朽的追求时，你也关心自己的血脉。",

	"The Sovereign Host isn't a demanding religion, and there are many cultural variations and unique sects across Khorvaire. As a follower of this faith, you could feel an especially strong connection to a single deity, or you could have a general reverence for the pantheon as a whole. Do you believe that there is a particular Sovereign who guides your actions? Was there a key moment in your life where you felt the hand of one of the Sovereigns or Six?": "主权神并不是一个苛刻的宗教，整个霍尔韦尔有许多文化差异和独特的教派。作为这个信仰的追随者，你可能会觉得与某个单一的神灵有特别强烈的联系，或者你可能对整个万神殿有一种普遍的敬畏。你是否相信有一个特定的主宰在指导你的行动？在你的生活中是否有一个关键时刻，你感受到了其中一位或六位主宰的手？",
	"Followers of the Sovereign Host are generally called Vassals, but despite the shared name, they are anything but monolithic. Variations of the Sovereign Host can be found across Eberron in many different cultures—the Pyrinean Creed of humanity, the Rushemé faith of the giants of Xen'drik, the Cazhaak traditions of Droaam. Precise names and groupings change, but the faith's basic principles remain the same.": "主宰者的追随者通常被称为 \"附庸\"，但尽管有共同的名字，他们并不是铁板一块。在Eberron的许多不同文化中都能找到 \"主宰者 \"的变体--人类的皮里奈信条，Xen'drik巨人的Rushemé信仰，Droaam的Cazhaak传统。准确的名称和分组会发生变化，但信仰的基本原则仍然是一样的。",
	"The Sovereigns don't walk the world. No one expects to meet Dol Dorn in the flesh. To do so would, in fact, be unnecessary and limiting. You don't expect to meet Dol Dorn because you know he is with you every time a blade is drawn, ready to guide your hand. Aureon watches over the wizard studying magic and the judge presiding in court. The Devourer is present in every storm, and you can't fight him any more than you can defeat an earthquake with a sword. A true Vassal doesn't need proof of the Sovereigns' existence for the world itself is the proof.": "主权者不在世界范围内行走。没有人期望见到多尔-多恩的真面目。事实上，这样做是不必要的，也是有局限性的。你不期望见到多尔-多恩，因为你知道每次拔刀时他都和你在一起，随时准备引导你的手。奥瑞恩监视着研究魔法的巫师和主持法庭的法官。吞噬者存在于每一场风暴中，你无法与他对抗，就像你无法用剑击败一场地震一样。一个真正的附庸不需要证明君主的存在，因为世界本身就是证据。",
	"With that said, many myths depict the Sovereigns in the flesh, performing heroic acts and setting particular elements of creation in motion. These myths are set during the Age of Demons, and Vassal doctrine maintains that the Sovereigns defeated and bound the fiendish overlords. As the overlords previously ruled reality, once they were defeated, the Sovereigns ascended to fill that role. So there are stories of Dol Dorn performing tremendous feats of strength, and you might find an artifact said to be Onatar's hammer; but these date back to a mythic age when they were champions, not yet true Sovereigns.": "尽管如此，许多神话都描述了主权者的肉身，他们做出了英雄般的举动，并将特定的创造元素付诸行动。这些神话的背景是恶魔时代，瓦萨的学说认为，君主们打败了恶魔般的霸主并将其束缚。由于霸主之前统治着现实，一旦他们被打败，主宰们就会升起，填补这一角色。因此，有关于多尔-多恩发挥巨大力量的故事，你可能会发现一件据说是奥纳塔的锤子的文物；但这些可以追溯到神话时代，那时他们是冠军，还不是真正的主权者。",
	"Every culture depicts the Sovereigns in different ways. The giants depict them as giants while the Pyrinean Creed (discussed in a later section) depicts them as humans. Many cultures use draconic imagery to represent the Sovereigns. But since the Sovereigns don't manifest physically, any representation of them is purely symbolic. Dol Dorn is the Warrior, Onatar is the Smith—any image that clearly depicts these concepts will do.": "每种文化都以不同的方式来描绘圣主。巨人将他们描绘成巨人，而皮里奈信条（在后面的章节中讨论）将他们描绘成人类。许多文化都使用龙人的意象来代表主权者。但由于主宰者没有身体上的表现，对他们的任何表现都纯粹是象征性的。多尔-多恩是战士，奥纳塔是史密斯--任何能清楚描述这些概念的形象都可以。",
	"The Sovereigns are everywhere, offering guidance to anyone who will listen. Due to the personal nature of this faith, it doesn't have the same degree of organization and hierarchy as the Silver Flame. A large community generally has an eight-sided temple to the Sovereign Host, staffed by full-time priests. In smaller villages and towns, there might be an untended shrine or a local person who is considered to be especially close to a Sovereign and performs ceremonies. In the town of Riverford, the innkeeper Dara is said to speak with Boldrei's voice; she's the pillar of the community, and people come to her with their problems and disputes.": "主权者无处不在，向任何愿意倾听的人提供指导。由于这种信仰的个人性质，它没有像银色火焰那样的组织和等级制度的程度。一个大的社区一般都有一个八面玲珑的主神庙，由全职祭司负责。在较小的村镇，可能会有一个无人看管的神龛，或者有一个被认为与某位圣主特别亲近的当地人，并举行仪式。在里弗福镇，据说旅馆老板达拉会用波德雷的声音说话；她是社区的支柱，人们有问题和纠纷都会来找她。",
	"A Sovereign priest's role isn't simply as an intermediary to the divine; anyone can talk to the Sovereigns. Instead, priests offer guidance and clarity, helping you understand the path you're on. A temple or priest often serves another function beyond their religious duties; the Great Hall of Aureon in Sharn is a library as well as a temple, while you might find a shrine to Kol Korran at the center of the public market. Priests serve as teachers, mediators, and guides, but they are often also subject matter experts in the path tied to the Sovereign they serve.": "主权祭司的作用并不只是作为神的中介；任何人都可以与主权者交谈。相反，牧师提供指导和澄清，帮助你了解你所走的道路。寺庙或祭司往往在宗教职责之外还有其他功能；沙恩的奥瑞恩大殿既是图书馆，也是寺庙，而你可能会在公共市场的中心找到科尔-科兰的神龛。祭司作为教师、调解员和向导，但他们往往也是与他们所服务的君主联系在一起的道路上的主题专家。",
	"In creating a Vassal character, think about your personal relationship to the Sovereigns. Who do you feel particularly close to? Do you feel you are blessed or directly guided by a Sovereign? Is there a point in your life where you believe one of the Sovereigns intervened on your behalf?": "在创造一个附庸角色时，想想你与君主的个人关系。你觉得与谁特别亲近？你是否觉得自己受到了某位君主的祝福或直接指导？在你的生活中，是否有一个点是你认为某个君主为你进行干预的？",
	"When human settlers came from Sarlona, they brought the Sovereign Host with them. While some traditions have evolved over the course of centuries and civilizations, the Pyrinean interpretation of the Sovereigns is part of the very foundation of the Five Nations, and its creed is reflected in their values. You should follow the laws (Aureon) and value the traditions of your community (Boldrei). Industry (Onatar) and commerce (Kol Korran) are encouraged, though greed (the Keeper) is not. On the battlefield, you should fight with courage (Dol Dorn) and honor (Dol Arrah), while not engaging in needless cruelty (the Mockery). You should trust in Aureon's laws and not take vengeance into your own hands (the Fury).": "当人类定居者从萨尔罗纳来到这里时，他们带来了主宰者。虽然一些传统在几个世纪和文明的进程中不断演变，但皮林纳人对主权者的解释是五国基础的一部分，其信条反映在他们的价值观中。你应该遵守法律（Aureon），重视社区的传统（Boldrei）。工业（Onatar）和商业（Kol Korran）受到鼓励，但贪婪（守护者）则不受鼓励。在战场上，你应该以勇气（多尔-多恩）和荣誉（多尔-阿拉）而战，同时不参与无谓的残酷行为（嘲笑者）。你应该相信奥瑞恩的法律，不要把复仇掌握在自己手中（愤怒）。",
	"Beyond these basic values, the Sovereigns are ubiquitous in the Five Nations. When you go into a courtroom, you stand on an Eye of Aureon. Standard marriage ceremonies invoke Boldrei. Many people aren't devoted Vassals and don't actually believe the Sovereigns are guiding their every action. But even such pragmatists recall the names of each Sovereign, know many of their songs, and will celebrate Wildnight or Boldrei's Feast. By and large, if you live in the Five Nations, it's assumed you're a Vassal unless you specifically say you're not.": "除了这些基本价值之外，主权者在五国中无处不在。当你进入法庭时，你站在奥里昂之眼上。标准的结婚仪式会引用波德莱。许多人并不是虔诚的附庸，实际上并不相信君主们在指导他们的每一个行动。但即使是这样的实用主义者也会记得每个君主的名字，知道他们的许多歌曲，并会庆祝野夜或Boldrei的节日。总的来说，如果你住在五国，就会被认为是附庸，除非你明确说你不是附庸。",
	"The giants of Xen'drik raised temples to Ouralon Lawbringer long before humanity embraced Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Hunters in Aundair give thanks to Balinor, but orcs in the Shadow Marches invoke Baalkan the Beastlord, while the Talenta halflings tell stories of clever Bally-Nur.": "在人类拥护法律和传说的君主奥瑞恩之前，Xen'drik的巨人就已经为奥瑞恩--法律使者建立了寺庙。昂代尔（Aundair）的猎人感谢巴里诺（Balinor），但阴影地带的兽人则召唤野兽之王巴尔坎（Baalkan），而塔伦塔（Talenta）的半身人则讲述聪明的巴里诺（Bally-Nur）的故事。",
	"Some of this is a natural process of syncretism. The Marcher orcs blended their original beliefs with the traditions of human settlers. But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name—and if the deity's name is similar to \"Balinor,\" the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game—it's easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.": "这其中有一些是自然的融合过程。游行者兽人将他们的原始信仰与人类定居者的传统相融合。但是塔伦塔人在遇到人类之前就已经在讲述他们的故事了。虽然学者们争论其中的原因，但大多数人都同意，一个传统与一个典型的主权者越相似，就越容易从该信仰中汲取神圣的力量。一个召唤狩猎之神的文化比一个崇拜同名巨型鲑鱼的文化更容易产生牧师和圣骑士--如果神灵的名字与 \"Balinor \"相似，那么与神圣魔法的联系将更加容易。Vassals的圣人断言这证明了主权者的存在，而怀疑者则说这可能只是一个数字游戏--从共同的信仰中汲取力量更容易，而对主权者的信仰已经达到了临界质量。",
	"Because of this diversity, Vassal priests are rarely concerned with heresy. Those who follow the Pyrinean Creed may attempt to correct what they see as flawed beliefs, but ultimately, most just smile at the ignorance of the Marcher orc, content in the knowledge that {@i they} know the proper names of the Sovereigns. Likewise, while player characters and NPCs may choose to follow one of the paths described below, you can always develop a unique twist on tradition or introduce a new cult that worships a specific grouping of Sovereigns. This openness is also reflected in Vassal interactions with the Church of the Silver Flame. The Pyrinean Creed asserts that the Sovereigns defeated the overlords at the dawn of time; if the Silver Flame is what keeps the overlords bound, presumably the Sovereigns created it. So there's no inherent conflict; rather, a Vassal will simply shrug and say, \"But why do you worship a cage?\"": "由于这种多样性，瓦萨的牧师们很少关注异端。那些遵循皮里奈信条的人可能会试图纠正他们认为有缺陷的信仰，但最终，大多数人只是对行军兽人的无知微笑，满足于知道（%0%）知道主权者的正确名字。同样，虽然玩家角色和NPC可以选择遵循下面描述的路径之一，但你总是可以对传统进行独特的扭曲，或者引入一个新的崇拜特定君主群体的邪教。这种开放性也反映在附庸与银焰教会的互动中。皮里奈的信条宣称，主权者在时间之初就击败了霸主；如果银色火焰是让霸主受到约束的东西，那么据推测，是主权者创造了它。所以没有内在的冲突；相反，附庸者会简单地耸耸肩说：\"但你为什么要崇拜一个笼子？\"",
	"The Sovereigns are worshiped in many different configurations and forms. A particular community could be devoted to a single Sovereign, or it could present a Sovereign and member of the Dark Six as being allied forces (as seen with the Restful Watch). A few of the best-known variants are described below.": "人们以许多不同的配置和形式来崇拜君主。一个特定的社区可能致力于一个单一的君主，也可能将一个君主和黑暗六神的成员作为联盟的力量来呈现（如在安息日所见）。下面介绍几个最知名的变体。",
	"The standard names and attributes of the Sovereigns and Six as presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}—Aureon, Balinor, the Shadow—are drawn from the Pyrinean Creed, the dominant tradition within the Five Nations. This is the source of the Octogram symbol, the division of Nine and Six, and holy days like Boldrei's Feast. If you follow the Pyrinean Creed, you believe in the faith as it's presented in the core Eberron sourcebooks. You recognize all of the Sovereigns and Six, even if you may feel that one in particular is especially influential in your life.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中提出的君主和六人组的标准名称和属性--奥里昂、巴里诺、影子--都来自五国内部的主导传统--皮里奈信条。这是八角形符号、九和六的划分以及博尔德雷节等圣日的来源。如果你追随皮里纳信条，你就会相信Eberron核心资料手册中所介绍的信仰。你承认所有的君主和六人组，即使你可能觉得其中一个在你的生活中特别有影响力。",
	"While the common faithful know the term \"Pyrinean Creed,\" its history is largely only of interest to scholars and priests. A typical Vassal might know that they believe in the Pyrinean Creed, but if you asked five of them what Pyrine was, you'd get five different answers—\"He was a legendary missionary!\" \"It was an old town in Daskara where there was a council!\" In reality, these beliefs were codified thousands of years ago in the Sarlonan nation of Pyrine, then carried to Khorvaire by human settlers. While Pyrine was assimilated by the Empire of Riedra over a thousand years ago and its people no longer worship the Sovereign Host, their legacy lives on in Khorvaire.": "虽然普通信徒知道 \"皮林信条 \"这个词，但它的历史基本上只有学者和牧师才感兴趣。一个典型的瓦萨人可能知道他们相信皮林信条，但如果你问五个人皮林是什么，你会得到五个不同的答案--\"他是一个传奇的传教士！\" \"那是达斯卡拉的一个古镇，那里有一个议会！\" 实际上，这些信仰是几千年前在撒隆人的皮林国编纂的，然后由人类定居者带到了霍尔韦尔。虽然皮林在一千多年前被里德拉帝国同化，它的人民不再崇拜主宰者，但他们的遗产在霍尔韦尔继续存在。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} assigns domains to individual Sovereigns, but Pyrinean priests can often perform the rites of any Sovereign, invoking the deity most appropriate to the current situation. In creating a Sovereign cleric, you can assert that you have a close tie to a particular Sovereign and primarily speak on their behalf; in this case, use the domain associated with that Sovereign. For example, the {@class cleric||Life|life} domain is a good option for a cleric who speaks for all Sovereigns equally, as it provides a general ability to protect your allies and community; and the {@class cleric||Knowledge|knowledge} domain makes sense for a priest who's more scholar than warrior.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}将领域分配给各个主权者，但皮林纳的牧师通常可以执行任何主权者的仪式，召唤最适合当前情况的神灵。在创建君主教士时，你可以断言你与某位君主关系密切，并主要代表他们说话；在这种情况下，使用与该君主相关的领域。例如，对于一个平等地代表所有君主说话的牧师来说，{@class cleric||Life|life}领域是一个很好的选择，因为它提供了一种保护你的盟友和社区的一般能力；而对于一个学者多于战士的牧师来说，{@class cleric||Knowledge|knowledge}领域是有意义的。",
	"The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant worships the Sovereigns in the same groupings and names as the Pyrinean Creed. However, the church asserts that the champions who fought the overlords were dragons, depicting them as such. The church is very focused on wealth and economic power; members are expected to contribute to the hoard of their local temple, and the priests often engage in behavior that outsiders might consider to be corrupt. They hold the unorthodox belief that mortals can ascend to become Sovereigns themselves—that by emulating a particular Sovereign, a mortal can eventually take their place. Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon. While this Sovereign ascension is believed to occur after death, some priests teach that devoted members—especially those who donate great sums to the temple hoard—can actually become dragons in life. While this seems unlikely, it could be an interesting background for a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer; it's not that you have draconic ancestry, but rather, due to your devotion, you appear to be evolving into a dragon.": "升龙教会以与皮里纳信条相同的分组和名称崇拜主宰者。然而，该教会宣称与霸主作战的冠军是龙，将他们描绘成龙。教会非常注重财富和经济实力；成员们要为当地神庙的囤积物做贡献，牧师们经常从事外人可能认为是腐败的行为。他们持有一种非正统的信念，即凡人可以自己升华为君主--通过模仿某位君主，凡人最终可以取代他们的位置。流行的传言认为，科兰伯格图书馆的创始人多里斯-阿莱尔-伊尔-科兰，建造图书馆是为了继承奥瑞恩的衣钵。虽然这种主权的提升被认为是在死后发生的，但一些牧师教导说，虔诚的成员--特别是那些向神庙囤积的巨额捐赠者--实际上可以在生活中变成龙。虽然这似乎不太可能，但对于龙族血统的巫师来说，这可能是一个有趣的背景；并不是说你有龙族的血统，而是由于你的奉献，你似乎正在进化成一条龙。",
	"Wyrm Ascendant Vassals believe the dragons themselves are divine tools and emissaries of the Sovereigns and Six, though few dragons have ever acknowledged the church in any way.

They can be found in every major city in the Five Nations, and even smaller towns may have a devotee of the Watch tending the boneyard. The Restful Watch maintains that the souls of the dead pass through Dolurrh into the realm of the Sovereigns—unless they are snatched by the Keeper's greedy talons. One of a priest's most important duties is helping bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or sacrifices sufficient to distract the Keeper and ensure the deceased's soul reaches Dolurrh. For a simple person with few achievements, a single coin might suffice.

	"Faithful of the Watch rarely discuss another aspect of their faith with outsiders—that once a soul rises to the realm of the Sovereigns, it can never return. The Restful Watch believes that if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, so it can be restored when the time is right. Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.": "守望先锋的信徒们很少与外人讨论他们信仰的另一个方面--一旦灵魂升到主权者的境界，就再也回不来了。守夜人认为，如果奥瑞恩知道一个死去的英雄在未来会被需要，他就会让守夜人在灵魂到达多鲁尔之前将其抢走，这样就可以在时机成熟时将其恢复。因此，虽然守夜人主要敬重奥瑞恩，但他们也理解和尊重守护者，并相信他有重要的作用。",

On the one hand, they honor particular groupings of the Sovereigns and Six, asserting that there are members of the Six with something valuable to offer worshippers. Beyond this, the cults are also secret societies—a form of fraternal order that binds people together even if they aren't truly invested in the religious aspects of the cult.

	"honors Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and Dol Azur (the Mockery). It was part of the united armies of Galifar, and cult chapters can be found in all of the armies of the Five Nations. Sect meetings provide a place for soldiers and veterans to interact as friends and equals, regardless of rank or nationality. The cult asserts that honor and courage are to be valued, but there is also a time and place for cunning and cruelty, even if it is never to be desired.": "荣耀多尔-阿拉、多尔-多恩和多尔-阿苏尔（嘲讽）。它是加利法尔联合军队的一部分，在五国的所有军队中都能找到邪教的分会。教派会议为士兵和退伍军人提供了一个作为朋友和平等交流的场所，不分等级或国籍。邪教主张重视荣誉和勇气，但也有狡猾和残忍的时间和地点，即使它永远不被人看好。",
	"honors Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (the Devourer). Sects are usually found in rural communities, and include farmers, hunters, and all manner of wanderers. The Three Faces of the Wild supports agriculture and hunting, but recognizes that the wild cannot be fully tamed. Members sometimes engage in ritual sacrifices or the burning of fields or other acts of destruction. They believe that the Devourer must have his due—and by making their chosen offerings, they keep him from striking elsewhere.": "阿拉瓦伊、巴里诺和沙冈（吞噬者）的荣誉。教派通常出现在农村社区，包括农民、猎人和各种形式的流浪者。野性三面派支持农业和狩猎，但承认野性不可能被完全驯服。成员们有时会进行祭祀活动，或焚烧田地或其他破坏行为。他们相信吞噬者必须得到他应得的东西--通过提供他们选择的祭品，他们阻止他在其他地方攻击。",
	"When priests of the Sovereign Host cast spells such as {@spell commune} or {@spell planar ally}, they usually interact with celestials from the planes. Typically, this is a celestial that embodies the same concept as the Sovereign in question; when a Vassal priest casts {@spell conjure celestial} in Dol Arrah's name, a warlike angel may come from Shavarath. When a celestial speaks the name of a Sovereign, listeners will hear the name they are most familiar with, whether that's Balinor, Baalkan, or Bally-Nur. As such, some scholars assert that it's slightly unclear if a summoned angel serves \"Dol Arrah,\" or if it instead serves \"Honor in War\" and it's just being translated as Dol Arrah. If asked such a pedantic question, both the angel and a devout Vassal might simply respond with, \"What's the difference? Dol Arrah is honor in war.\"": "当圣主的牧师们施展诸如{@spell commune}或{@spell planar ally}的法术时，他们通常会与来自各星球的天人互动。通常，这是一个体现了与相关主宰相同概念的天人；当瓦萨牧师以多尔-阿拉的名义施展（%2%）时，一个好战的天使可能来自沙瓦拉斯。当天人说出君主的名字时，听众会听到他们最熟悉的名字，无论那是巴里诺、巴尔坎还是巴里努尔。因此，一些学者断言，稍微不清楚被召唤的天使是为 \"多尔-阿拉 \"服务，还是相反为 \"战争中的荣誉 \"服务，只是被翻译成了多尔-阿拉。如果被问到这样一个迂腐的问题，天使和虔诚的瓦萨都可能简单地回答：\"有什么区别？Dol Arrah是战争中的荣誉\"。",
	"The Sovereigns embody pillars of civilization: agriculture, commerce, industry, honor, law. The Dark Six represent frightening and destructive forces, their existence explaining why bad things happen in the world. When a wildfire destroys a village, the Devourer is to blame. When someone commits a crime of passion, they were overcome by the Fury. When monsters prey on the innocent, good people curse the Shadow.": "主权者体现了文明的支柱：农业、商业、工业、荣誉、法律。黑暗六人组代表可怕的破坏性力量，他们的存在解释了为什么世界上会发生坏事。当一场野火摧毁了一个村庄时，吞噬者应受到谴责。当有人犯下激情犯罪时，他们被 \"愤怒 \"所征服。当怪物掠夺无辜者时，善良的人们会诅咒阴影。",
	"The Pyrinean Creed exhorts that the Dark Six should be shunned, teaching their names and aspects so that people can recognize their works and understand how to resist them. When Pyrinean Vassals do make offerings to the Dark Six, it's usually as an act of desperation: begging the Devourer to calm storm-tossed waters or calling on the Fury to enact a terrible revenge when the law has failed. However, there are those in the Five Nations and beyond who see the Dark Six as powers to be respected and worshiped in their own right. This section presents a brief overview of the Dark Six and how their followers can be encountered in the Five Nations. These descriptions expand on the material presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, further developing the roles of these deities. The monsters of Droaam also have a quite different view of the Sovereigns and Six, explored in more detail in chapter 4.": "皮里纳信条劝告人们应该避开黑暗六神，教导他们的名字和方面，以便人们能够识别他们的作品并了解如何抵制他们。当皮林尼亚的臣民向黑暗六神献祭时，通常是出于无奈：乞求吞噬者平息风暴之水，或在法律失效时呼唤怒火来实施可怕的复仇行动。然而，在五国和其他国家，也有一些人将黑暗六人组视为值得尊重和崇拜的力量，他们有自己的权利。本节简要介绍了黑暗六人组的情况，以及在五国中如何遇到他们的追随者。这些描述是对{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中的材料的扩展，进一步发展了这些神祗的作用。德罗亚姆的怪物们对君主和六人组也有相当不同的看法，在第四章中会有更详细的探讨。",
	"Nature's wrath": "大自然的愤怒",
	"The Devourer is the tsunami that overwhelms the tallest ship, the wildfire that consumes the grandest castle, the earthquake that levels the most glorious city. He is the vast and primordial power of nature, a force that will break any chain and wear down the strongest wall. The Devourer is the glorious cruelty that drives the predator, the cry of the hawk and the howl of the wolf. He is all that is wild, savage, and unknowable. He is the deepest ocean, a force that can be crossed but never controlled.": "吞噬者是压倒最高船只的海啸，是吞噬最宏伟城堡的野火，是夷平最光辉城市的地震。他是自然界巨大而原始的力量，是一种可以打破任何链条、磨灭最坚固墙壁的力量。吞噬者是驱使捕食者的光荣的残酷，是鹰的叫声和狼的嚎叫。他是所有野性、野蛮和不可知的东西。他是最深的海洋，一种可以跨越但永远无法控制的力量。",
	"Those who fear the Devourer see him as an entirely destructive force. Arawai is the patron of agriculture, of peacefully harvesting nature's bounty. Balinor is the patron of the hunt, of civilized folk using bow, spear, and skill to challenge or tame the mightiest beasts. These deities reflect the power of civilization to harness and control the natural world, but the Devourer puts the lie to this, showing that nature will never be truly tamed.": "那些害怕吞噬者的人认为他是一种完全的破坏性力量。阿拉威是农业的守护神，和平地收获大自然的恩惠。巴里诺（Balinor）是狩猎的守护神，文明人使用弓箭、长矛和技巧挑战或驯服最强大的猛兽。这些神灵反映了文明驾驭和控制自然界的力量，但 \"吞噬者 \"却对其进行了否定，表明自然界永远不会被真正驯服。",
	"Those who embrace the Devourer celebrate the glorious power of the wilds. They revel in the raging storm and gladly embrace their predatory instincts. They accept that nature is often bloody and cruel, and don't hesitate to follow its example. But while it may be harsh, nature is rarely evil. Priests of the Devourer often urge their parishioners to follow their instincts, or teach people to live in accord with nature instead of forcing their will upon it. They may serve as intermediaries, convincing the Devourer to redirect his wrath and spare their followers—or to turn his rage against their enemies.": "那些拥护吞噬者的人庆祝荒野的光荣力量。他们陶醉于汹涌的风暴，欣然接受自己的掠夺本能。他们接受自然界往往是血腥和残酷的，并毫不犹豫地效仿它。但是，虽然它可能是严酷的，但自然界很少是邪恶的。吞噬者的牧师经常敦促他们的教友遵循他们的本能，或者教导人们顺应自然，而不是将他们的意志强加于自然。他们可能充当中间人，说服吞噬者改变其愤怒的方向，放过他们的追随者，或者将其怒火转向他们的敌人。",
	"Passion, revenge": "激情、复仇",
	"The Fury is a silent whisper that can drive you to doubt or despair. She is reckless rage and all-consuming passion. Instinct is the voice of the Fury, guiding us when rational thought fails. And she is the Sovereign of revenge, promising vengeance to those willing to surrender to her. Her father the Devourer embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control.": "愤怒是一种无声的低语，可以使你产生怀疑或绝望。她是不计后果的愤怒和无休止的激情。本能是 \"愤怒 \"的声音，在理性思考失败时引导我们。她是复仇的主宰，向那些愿意向她投降的人承诺复仇。她的父亲 \"吞噬者 \"体现了我们外部风暴的破坏力；\"愤怒 \"是我们内心深处的风暴，是我们努力控制的疯狂情绪。",
	"Devotees of the Fury generally follow one of two paths. Revelers believe that suppressing emotion causes anguish, and that people should embrace their emotions fully and act on impulse and instinct. They hold wild, ecstatic celebrations as a way for participants to throw off the chains of civilization for a moment and experience life and emotion fully. A player character who follows this path might be a Berserker barbarian or a bard using the {@class bard||College of Glamour|glamour|XGE}—either embracing their own primal emotion or inspiring it in others. A sorcerer might attribute their power to wild emotion; they can only access their magic when they let the Fury guide them.": "怒火的信徒一般遵循两条道路中的一条。狂欢者认为，压抑情感会导致痛苦，人们应该充分拥抱自己的情感，凭冲动和本能行事。他们举行狂热的庆祝活动，作为一种方式，让参与者暂时抛开文明的枷锁，充分体验生活和情感。走这条路的玩家角色可能是一个狂暴的野蛮人或使用（%0%）的吟游诗人--要么拥抱自己的原始情感，要么在别人身上激发它。一个巫师可能将他们的力量归结为狂野的情感；他们只有在让愤怒引导他们的时候才能使用他们的魔法。",
	"The other path of the Fury is the road of revenge. People who have suffered grievously can call on the Fury to give them the will and strength to take vengeance into their own hands. Or rather than seeking revenge themselves, one tradition calls for someone who has been wronged to place a red candle in a window, inscribed with the name of their tormentor. This is an invitation for the Fury to take vengeance on their behalf. A player character following this path could be charged to investigate and fulfill these calls for revenge. While this could be the path of a cleric or paladin, it could just as easily suit an {@class rogue||Assassin|assassin} rogue, a bard of the {@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}, or a warlock.": "愤怒之神的另一条道路是复仇之路。遭受不幸的人可以呼唤 \"愤怒 \"给他们意志和力量，让他们自己去复仇。或者，与其自己寻求复仇，一个传统要求受了委屈的人在窗户上放一根红蜡烛，上面刻着折磨者的名字。这是对愤怒之神的邀请，请他代表他们进行复仇。走这条路的玩家角色可以负责调查并完成这些复仇的召唤。虽然这可能是牧师或圣骑士的道路，但它也很容易适合{@class rogue||Assassin|assassin}游荡者、{@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}吟游诗人或术士。",
	"Death, greed, hoarding": "死亡、贪婪、囤积",
	"Every Vassal knows they should never flaunt good fortune, avoiding arrogance and pride. Those who crow too loudly may catch the jealous eye of the Keeper. Even the mightiest hero can be laid low by disease or ill fortune, as the Keeper has a vast arsenal to bring down those that he desires. Once he pulls you down into the darkness, he will snatch your soul before it can reach Dolurrh and add you to his endless hoard, where he can toy with you and torment you until the end of time.": "每个附庸都知道他们不应该炫耀好运，避免傲慢和自大。那些过于喧嚣的人可能会引起守护者嫉妒的目光。即使是最强大的英雄也会被疾病或厄运击倒，因为守护者有一个巨大的武器库来击倒他所希望的人。一旦他把你拉到黑暗中，他就会在你的灵魂到达多鲁尔之前抢走你的灵魂，把你加入他无尽的囤积中，在那里他可以玩弄你，折磨你，直到时间的尽头。",
	"The Keeper is the patron of those who put personal gain above all else. He guides those who use guile to gain gold, regardless of the cost to others. A rogue who invokes Olladra sees themselves as the hero of the story; one who calls on the Keeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals—though his bargains are always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make these deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are often abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could bargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for fame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous, there's no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to anticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die. This could easily be a part of the backstory of a player character. Did your entertainer make a bargain with the Keeper?": "守护者是那些将个人利益置于一切之上的人的守护者。他引导那些使用诡计获得金币的人，而不考虑其他人的代价。援引奥拉德拉的流氓认为自己是故事中的英雄；而召唤守护者的人则对成为反派毫无顾忌。除了引导那些把利益放在首位的人，守护者还以愿意做交易而闻名--尽管他的交易总是对他有利。被称为 \"爪牙 \"的祭司代表守护者进行这些交易，尽管这些条件通常是抽象的，而且纯粹是由信仰驱动的。一个艺人可以和塔隆讨价还价，用他们十年的生命换取名声；即使这个艺人后来成名了，也无法知道这是否是讨价还价的结果，也无法预料这个艺人何时会突然死亡。这很容易成为玩家角色的背景故事的一部分。你的艺人是否与守护者达成了交易？",
	"Another possible path for a player character or deadly NPC is that of being a Keeper's Fang. These people receive visions of things that the Keeper wishes to add to his hoard; these are usually the souls of specific people, but they could also be artifacts or other unique treasures. This is an interesting path for an {@class rogue||Assassin|assassin} rogue, an {@class paladin||Oathbreaker|oathbreaker|DMG} paladin, or a {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} warlock.": "玩家角色或致命的NPC的另一个可能的途径是成为守护者的方。这些人收到了守护者希望加入他的仓库的东西的幻象；这些东西通常是特定人的灵魂，但也可能是神器或其他独特的宝物。对于{@class rogue||Assassin|assassin}游侠、{@class paladin||Oathbreaker|oathbreaker|DMG}圣骑士或{@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}术士来说，这是一个有趣的途径。",
	"Betrayal and bloodshed": "背叛和流血事件",
	"Dol Arrah will show you how to fight with honor, Dol Dorn will grant you courage, and when you die, at least you'll know you did so bravely and honorably. The Mockery will drag you through mud and blood, drive you to betray your principles and employ tactics that horrify your allies and enemies alike—but at the end of the day, you'll be standing over the corpse of your foe. Which path will you follow?": "多尔亚拉会告诉你如何光荣地战斗，多尔多恩会赋予你勇气，当你死亡时，至少你会知道你是勇敢地、光荣地完成了任务。嘲笑会把你拖入泥潭和血泊中，驱使你背叛你的原则，采用让你的盟友和敌人都感到恐惧的战术--但在一天结束时，你会站在敌人的尸体上。你会走哪条路？",
	"Those who despise the Dark Six condemn the Mockery as a villain, a monster who encourages cruel and treacherous behavior. This can be as simple as ambushing an enemy, using stealth instead of facing them openly. Or it can mean slaughtering innocents, torturing your foes, breaking a truce—anything to bring you victory. Those who embrace the path of the Mockery may say that such tactics are the only way to bring down a superior foe. Honor is a luxury for the strong; for those who are weak and oppressed, victory is all that truly matters.": "那些鄙视黑暗六人组的人谴责嘲笑者是一个恶棍，一个鼓励残忍和奸诈行为的怪物。这可以是简单的伏击敌人，使用隐身术而不是公开面对他们。也可以是屠杀无辜者，折磨你的敌人，破坏停战协议--任何能给你带来胜利的事情。那些拥护嘲讽之路的人可能会说，这种战术是打倒优势敌人的唯一方法。荣誉是强者的奢侈品；对于那些弱者和被压迫者来说，胜利才是真正重要的。",
	"Others who follow the Mockery assert that the very idea of honor in war is delusional. Pain, terror, and death are the inevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the Mockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin who kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a weakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation—all these might view the Mockery as an ally. While this can be a dark path for a player character to follow, a hero could use the techniques of the Mockery in pursuit of a noble cause. A grim vigilante who uses stealth and fear to terrify cowardly criminals into changing their ways could be guided by the Mockery.": "其他追随 \"嘲笑 \"的人断言，在战争中获得荣誉的想法本身就是妄想。痛苦、恐怖和死亡是暴力的必然结果；至少那些追随Mockery的人承认其他人否认的事实。毫无征兆地杀人的刺客，视仁慈为弱点的野蛮人，培养可怕名声的海盗--所有这些人都可能将Mockery视为盟友。虽然对于玩家角色来说，这可能是一条黑暗的道路，但英雄可以使用Mockery的技术来追求一个崇高的事业。一个使用隐身术和恐惧来吓唬胆小的罪犯使其改过自新的严峻的义务警员，可以由Mockery指导。",
	"Ambition and temptation, forbidden knowledge, monsters": "野心和诱惑，禁忌的知识，怪兽",
	"The war between the Shadow and Aureon rages in all of us. Aureon's voice tells us that we are stronger together, that it's worth it to suffer for the sake of the common good. The Shadow whispers that there is no common good—all that matters is what you need and what you can do. Why should you make sacrifices for others instead of doing what's best for yourself? Why should you give when you can take?": "影子和奥里昂之间的战争在我们所有人的心中肆虐。奥瑞恩的声音告诉我们，我们在一起会更强大，为了共同的利益而受苦是值得的。影子低声说，没有共同利益--所有重要的是你需要什么，你能做什么。你为什么要为别人做出牺牲，而不是做对自己最有利的事情？你为什么要在你能得到的时候给予？",
	"The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition. Those who revere it view this as a positive trait; the Shadow will show you how to be the best you can be. But how far will you go in pursuit of your ambition? What—or who—will you sacrifice? Priests who embrace this aspect of the Shadow call themselves Mentors, emphasizing that they can show you how to achieve your full potential; others call them Tempters, as they will always drive you down the darkest path. The Pyrinean Creed says that the Shadow consumes the souls of those who fall prey to its temptation; a Mentor will tell you that this is exactly the sort of lie the Sovereigns use to trick you into following their rules.": "影子是野心的主宰者。那些崇尚它的人认为这是一个积极的特征；影子会告诉你如何成为最好的人。但是，为了追求你的野心，你会走多远？你会牺牲什么或谁？拥抱影子这一方面的牧师称自己为导师，强调他们可以告诉你如何实现你的全部潜力；其他人称他们为诱惑者，因为他们总是会把你赶到最黑暗的路上。皮里纳信条说，影子会吞噬那些受其诱惑的人的灵魂；导师会告诉你，这正是君主用来欺骗你遵守他们规则的谎言。",
	"The Shadow is also the keeper of forbidden knowledge, of secrets you know you shouldn't pursue. This includes arcane magic—granting powers virtuous people should shun (see the Forbidden Magic sidebar for ideas about this). Any spellcasting character could attribute their powers to the Shadow; a wizard might have been struggling with their studies, but after a sacrifice to the Shadow, they awoke with new insights. The Shadow can also serve as a warlock's patron, likely in the role of the {@class warlock||Fiend|fiend} or the {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}. While the Shadow won't interact directly with a warlock, they could receive visions like a priest; they could interact with a fiend who claims to speak for the Shadow; or they could be mistaken about the nature of their patron, and actually be bound to the overlord Sul Khatesh.": "影子也是禁忌知识的守护者，是你知道你不应该追求的秘密。这包括奥秘的魔法--赋予有德行的人应该回避的力量（见禁忌魔法侧边栏的想法）。任何法术角色都可以把他们的力量归功于影子；一个巫师可能一直在努力学习，但在向影子献祭后，他们以新的洞察力醒来了。影子也可以作为术士的守护者，可能是以（%0%）或（%1%）的角色。虽然影子不会直接与术士互动，但他们可以像牧师一样收到异象；他们可以与声称代表影子说话的恶魔互动；或者他们可能误解了他们的守护者的性质，实际上是与霸主Sul Khatesh绑定。",
	"In addition to mystical knowledge, priests of the Shadow often know things they simply shouldn't know—secrets that can harm people if revealed. Priests of the Shadow can sometimes be found working as fixers in the criminal underworld; how much are you willing to pay for the knowledge you seek?": "除了神秘的知识之外，影子牧师还经常知道一些他们根本不应该知道的事情--如果被揭露，会对人们造成伤害的秘密。阴影祭司有时会被发现在黑社会中充当掮客；你愿意为你所寻求的知识付出多少？",
	"Beyond all this, the Shadow is seen as a corrupting force that creates monsters, both figuratively through temptation, and literally—it is said to have created many of the monstrosities that prey on innocents. In turn, many monstrous creatures see the Shadow as their patron.": "除此以外，影子还被视为创造怪物的腐败力量，无论是通过诱惑，还是通过字面意思，据说它创造了许多掠夺无辜者的怪兽。反过来，许多怪物将影子视为他们的守护者。",
	"The Shadow tempts you to perform evil actions and can teach spells no one should know. While the game's rules aren't designed with the idea of forbidden spells that shouldn't be cast, a DM could choose to grant a character one or more additional spells that have dangerous or unpleasant side effects every time they're cast. Or the Shadow could grant a spellcaster the ability to increase the power of any spell they know—as if it was cast using a higher-level spell slot—once per long rest, but in doing this, it triggers a negative effect.": "阴影诱惑你进行邪恶的行动，并能教导任何人都不应该知道的法术。虽然游戏规则的设计没有考虑到不应该施展的禁忌法术，但管理员可以选择赋予角色一个或多个额外的法术，这些法术每次施展都会产生危险或不愉快的副作用。或者，影子可以赋予施法者增加他们所知道的任何法术的威力的能力--就像用更高等级的法术槽施法一样--每次长时休息一次，但在这样做时，会触发一个负面效应。",
	"Regardless of what effects you establish, they should illustrate a clear and concrete reason why this magic is forbidden. Someone or something will pay a price every time this magic is used. Consider the following ideas:": "无论你建立什么样的效果，它们都应该说明一个明确而具体的理由，说明为什么这个魔法是被禁止的。每次使用这种魔法时，某人或某物将付出代价。请考虑以下想法。",
	"When you cast the spell, roll a d6. The DM chooses you or one of your allies, either dealing the result as necrotic damage or applying it as a penalty to that creature's next saving throw.": "当你施展这个咒语时，掷一个D6。DM会选择你或你的一个盟友，将结果作为坏死伤害来处理，或将其作为该生物的下一个蓄力动作的惩罚。",
	"When you cast the spell, an innocent creature dies. You have no control over who will suffer and may never know who it is.": "当你施法时，一个无辜的生物会死亡。你无法控制谁会受苦，也可能永远不知道是谁。",
	"When you cast the spell, plants wither and all living creatures within 15 feet of you take one point of necrotic damage.": "当你施法时，植物会枯萎，在你周围15英尺内的所有生物都会受到一点坏死的伤害。",
	"When you cast the spell, choose an ally within sight. That player can reveal a disturbing secret about their character to you. This must be worse than any previous secret they've revealed; if they can't or if they choose not to, the spell fails.": "当你施法时，在视线范围内选择一个盟友。该玩家可以向你透露一个关于他们角色的令人不安的秘密。这个秘密必须比他们之前透露的任何秘密都要糟糕；如果他们不能透露或者他们选择不透露，则咒语失败。",
	"When you cast the spell, the effect of the spell itself is particularly horrifying.": "当你施展法术时，法术本身的效果特别恐怖。",
	"Change, chaos": "变化，混乱",
	"Paladins are rarely champions of the Traveler, though any oath's mechanical features could be used to pursue a life of change.": "圣骑士很少是旅行者的拥护者，尽管任何誓言的机械特征都可以用来追求改变生活。",
	"The Traveler touches the domains of many other Sovereigns. Like Aureon and the Shadow, the Traveler is a source of knowledge. Along with Olladra and the Mockery, it is a patron of those who rely on deception and cunning. Like Onatar and the Fury, it can provide inspiration to the artisan. Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere it agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it's because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you have known. If it helps you deceive, it's because your actions will introduce chaos and crisis—whether into your life or the lives of others. Onatar will teach a swordsmith to make a better sword; the Traveler might show them how to make a bomb, changing the face of warfare. The Traveler isn't here to satisfy your greed or to grant your ambitions. Instead, it will set you on paths you never thought to try. This may sometimes grant you good fortune, but when you call on the Traveler, you're inviting the unexpected into your life.": "旅行者触及许多其他君主的领域。像奥瑞恩和影子一样，旅行者是知识的来源。与奥拉德拉和嘲讽一样，它是那些依靠欺骗和狡猾的人的守护神。就像奥纳塔和怒火，它可以为工匠提供灵感。惧怕旅行者的人和崇尚旅行者的人都同意一件事：无论旅行者给予什么礼物，它们总是会导致混乱。如果旅行者给你知识，那是因为这个启示将迫使你重新评估你所知道的一切。如果它帮助你欺骗，那是因为你的行为会引入混乱和危机--无论是在你的生活中还是在别人的生活中。奥纳塔会教一个剑匠制造更好的剑；旅行者可能会告诉他们如何制造炸弹，改变战争的面貌。旅行者在这里不是为了满足你的贪婪，也不是为了实现你的野心。相反，它将使你走上你从未想过要尝试的道路。这有时可能会给你带来好运，但当你呼唤旅行者时，你就会邀请意外进入你的生活。",
	"One of the more infamous Traveler cults within the Five Nations is hidden within House Cannith. While Onatar is the acknowledged patron of House Cannith, some believe that the Traveler is the source of dramatic inspiration, helping artificers make unforeseen breakthroughs. Those who invoke the Traveler know that its gifts will surely have a cost and could shake the foundations of civilization, but they still yearn for that grand discovery. Many in House Cannith believe that Aaren d'Cannith—the inventor of the warforged—was a Traveler cultist; others assume that the Mourning may have been the work of a Cannith heir following the path of the Traveler.": "五国中比较臭名昭著的旅行者邪教之一就隐藏在坎尼斯家族中。虽然奥纳塔是坎尼斯家族公认的守护神，但有些人认为旅行者是戏剧性灵感的来源，帮助工匠们取得意想不到的突破。那些召唤旅行者的人知道，它的礼物肯定会有代价，并可能动摇文明的基础，但他们仍然渴望那个伟大的发现。坎尼斯家族中的许多人都相信阿伦-坎尼斯（Aaren d'Cannith）--战堡的发明者--是旅行者的崇拜者；其他人则认为，哀悼会可能是坎尼斯的一个继承人按照旅行者的路线所做的。",
	"Some who follow the Traveler are tricksters, causing chaos with no clear agenda. But others see themselves as guides, playing tricks on people in order to teach them lessons. Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions—not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven't outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers described in chapter 2 fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them. Ultimately, the Traveler will throw your life into chaos—for it's by adapting to this chaos that people grow.": "一些追随旅行者的人是诡计多端的人，在没有明确议程的情况下造成混乱。但也有人把自己看成是向导，在人们身上耍花招，以便给他们上课。引导者寻求挑战既定的传统、法律或制度--不一定是为了破坏它们，而是为了确保它们没有过期。还有一些人是流浪者，接受不断变化的生活。第二章中描述的变身旅行者就属于这一类，他们相信只要他们保持运动状态，旅行者就会引导和保护他们。最终，旅行者会让你的生活陷入混乱，因为人们正是通过适应这种混乱而成长。",

But no member of such an organization would call themselves a \"cultist of the Dragon Below.\" As a true believer, you might be a blessed eye of the All-Seer, a pilgrim on the road to the Inner Sun, or a warlock in the court of the Queen of Shadows. If you're a member of one of these three cults, you don't see the other two as allies, for they're clearly dangerous and delusional. And while outsiders may be able to guess what force is behind the cult—it doesn't take a Korranberg sage to guess that the people growing eyes on their hands might be tied to Belashyrra—only a fraction of the cults of the Dragon Below knowingly serve a daelkyr or overlord.": "\"下面的龙的崇拜 \"这一称号是一个笼统的术语，用来描述任何为邪恶力量服务或具有违背理性思维的怪异信仰的教派。但这样一个组织的成员都不会自称是 \"下面的龙的崇拜者\"。作为一个真正的信徒，你可能是万物之灵的祝福之眼，是通往内阳之路的朝圣者，或者是影后宫中的术士。如果你是这三个邪教中的一个，你就不会把其他两个看作是盟友，因为他们显然是危险和妄想的。虽然外人也许能猜到邪教背后的力量--不需要科兰伯格的圣人也能猜到，那些手上长着眼睛的人可能与贝拉希拉有关系--但只有一小部分龙之谷的邪教知道为daelkyr或霸主服务。",

And he produces revenants, innocents who wake up convinced they are reincarnated soldiers with a duty to complete unfinished battles. This is common—most overlords and daelkyr have multiple cults, each completely unaware of another. While each cult is unique, most fall into one of the following three categories.": "{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的野蛮人部落吵着要以他的名义在恶魔荒原洒下鲜血。他在五国的忠臣巧妙地散布仇恨和无知。他还制造复仇者，那些醒来后确信自己是转世的士兵，有责任完成未完成的战斗的无辜者。这种情况很常见--大多数霸主和达伊尔克尔都有多个邪教，每个邪教都完全不知道另一个。虽然每个邪教都很独特，但大多数都属于以下三类之一。",
	"Members of these cults are united by shared delusions, the reality of their minds corrupted by a horrifying alien force. Sometimes the delusion infects those who take part in the rituals; other times the ideas first leak into people's minds, then draw them to the cult. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below can never be wiped out, and why they can appear anywhere—you never know when or where an irrational idea can take root, twisting the thoughts and beliefs of innocent people.": "这些邪教成员因共同的妄想而结合在一起，他们头脑中的现实被一种可怕的外来力量所腐蚀。有时，这种妄想会感染那些参加仪式的人；其他时候，这些想法首先渗入人们的头脑，然后吸引他们加入邪教。这就是为什么 \"地下之龙 \"的邪教永远无法被消灭，也是为什么它们可以出现在任何地方--你永远不知道一个非理性的想法何时何地可以扎根，扭曲无辜者的思想和信仰。",
	"While a corrupted cult's beliefs and actions may seem irrational to outsiders, to members of the cult they make perfect sense. A revenant truly believes they are a legendary hero reincarnated. A Vigilant Eye cultist believes they've been given blessed vision that reveals evildoers who must die. The fact the cultist has grown a new eye doesn't seem strange to them—{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.} Corrupted cultists may see the world differently than people around them. A group of revenants could be working with a mind flayer and dolgrims, but they see these aberrations as loyal knights tied to their ancient order. When encountering a corrupted cult, player characters will face the challenge of making sense of the delusion—understanding what the cult members believe they're trying to accomplish, and how it relates to what they're actually doing. These delusions have nothing to do with mental illness and cannot be treated at a Jorasco healing house. This is a form of supernatural influence with a specific cause—a corrupting alien entity—and with a specific effect; corruption can take hold of anyone at any time, and cultists may otherwise appear perfectly healthy and sane.": "虽然在外人看来，一个堕落的邪教的信仰和行为可能是不合理的，但对邪教成员来说，它们是完全合理的。一个复仇者真正相信他们是传奇英雄的转世。一个警戒之眼的邪教成员相信他们得到了受祝福的视野，揭示了必须死亡的恶人。邪教徒长出了一只新的眼睛，这对他们来说并不奇怪--{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.}被腐蚀的邪教徒看到的世界可能与他们周围的人不同。一群复仇者可能正在与一个精神分裂者和dolgrims合作，但他们把这些反常者看作是与他们的古老秩序相联系的忠诚骑士。当遇到一个腐化的邪教时，玩家角色将面临的挑战是如何理解这种错觉--理解邪教成员认为他们要完成的任务，以及它与他们实际所做的事情之间的关系。这些妄想与精神疾病无关，不能在Jorasco疗养院治疗。这是一种超自然的影响，有特定的原因--腐败的外星实体--并有特定的效果；腐败可以在任何时候影响到任何人，而邪教成员可能在其他方面显得非常健康和理智。",
	"Corrupted cults rarely last long. They typically come into existence with a clear purpose, a specific scheme that somehow benefits their guiding power. After this scheme succeeds or fails, the driving force often abandons the survivors. The question is whether this releases cultists from the delusion, or whether they are simply abandoned—or even driven toward destructive acts. A second important question is whether it's possible to free a cultist from their delusion while the cult is still active. This could require magic, such as {@spell greater restoration}. But it could simply require the cultist to be isolated from their allies and deprogrammed, or perhaps separated from an item that is reinforcing the delusion. If this powerful delusion can be broken, perhaps the cultist's original identity can reassert itself.": "腐败的邪教很少持续很长时间。他们通常有一个明确的目的，一个特定的计划，以某种方式使他们的指导力量受益。在这个计划成功或失败后，驱动力往往会抛弃幸存者。问题是，这是否将邪教人员从妄想中释放出来，或者他们是否只是被抛弃，或者甚至被驱使去做破坏性的行为。第二个重要的问题是，在邪教仍然活跃的情况下，是否有可能将邪教人员从他们的妄想中释放出来。这可能需要魔法，比如（%0%）。但也可能只需要将邪教者与他们的盟友隔离开来，并对其进行解除编程，或者也许与加强妄想的物品分开。如果这个强大的错觉可以被打破，也许邪教者的原始身份可以重新得到确认。",
	"The power behind a corrupted cult isn't always obvious. Loyalists know the power they serve and often proudly proclaim it, but many other corrupted cults aren't aware of the power behind them. Vigilant Eye cultists could mistakenly believe that their blessed eyes are a gift from Aureon, while a revenant might believe Dol Arrah has returned them to the world. Even if the cultists themselves don't realize who they serve, the trappings can be a giveaway. Belashyrra's cultists often deal with eyes or beholders, Dyrrn employs illithids and doppelgangers, and Kyrzin's cults usually have something to do with oozes and slime. But sometimes a cult can appear perfectly innocent. Are you absolutely certain that revenant {@i wasn't} restored by Dol Arrah?": "腐败的邪教背后的力量并不总是很明显。忠诚者知道他们所服务的力量，并经常自豪地宣扬它，但许多其他被腐蚀的邪教并不清楚他们背后的力量。警惕之眼的邪教徒可能误以为他们被祝福的眼睛是奥瑞恩的礼物，而复仇者可能认为多尔-阿拉赫把他们还给了世界。即使邪教徒们自己没有意识到他们为谁服务，但他们的外衣也会让人看出来。Belashyrra的邪教徒经常与眼睛或持灵者打交道，Dyrrn雇佣了illithids和二重身，而Kyrzin的邪教徒通常与渗出物和粘液有关。但有时一个邪教可以显得非常无辜。你完全确定那个复仇者（%0%）是由多尔-亚拉恢复的吗？",
	"There are cults far older than any human civilization. Their strongholds are in desolate regions—the Demon Wastes, the Shadow Marches—but immigrants have carried these beliefs into the Five Nations. The members of these cults have been raised to believe that the traditions of their faith are normal. {@i You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.}": "有一些邪教比任何人类文明都要古老。他们的据点在荒凉的地区--恶魔荒原、阴影地带--但移民将这些信仰带到了五国。这些邪教的成员被培养成相信他们信仰的传统是正常的。{@i You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.}",
	"Traditional cultists are typically less volatile and extreme than corrupted cultists; surviving long enough to become a tradition means avoiding reckless behavior and learning to keep your faith hidden from strangers. Many traditional cults can seem harmless; for the most part, Whisperers have no interest in harming or interacting with outsiders. However, traditional cults provide a lurking support network that can be activated when needed. {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} has loyalists hidden throughout the armies of the Five Nations, always ready to escalate violent situations. And a town could be filled with followers of the Transcendent Flesh who appear completely harmless and mundane—until the Night of Six Moons, when they all attach their symbionts and tear apart any outsiders unlucky enough to be in the town that night.": "传统的邪教徒通常没有腐败的邪教徒那么动荡和极端；生存足够长的时间，成为一个传统意味着要避免鲁莽的行为，并学会对陌生人隐藏自己的信仰。许多传统邪教看起来无害；在大多数情况下，低语者对伤害或与外人交往没有兴趣。然而，传统邪教提供了一个潜伏的支持网络，可以在需要时启动。{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的忠诚者隐藏在五国的军队中，随时准备升级暴力局势。而一个城镇可能充满了超凡肉体的追随者，他们看起来完全无害，很平凡--直到 \"六个月亮之夜\"，他们都附着他们的共生体，撕碎任何有幸在那晚出现在城镇的外来者。",
	"Traditional cults are less extreme than corrupted ones, but they still see the world through a strange lens, despite knowing the power they're bound to. Some traditional cults believe their patrons are simply misunderstood—{@i Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!} Others celebrate the destructive or chaotic aspects of their patrons, either believing that this corrupt world deserves to be torn down, or that the faithful will be elevated in the next age. Even a cultist who reveres {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} may not be evil; they could believe the corrupt world must be washed in blood to cleanse evil, and aside from their duties to the Orphan King, they may be gentle and altruistic.": "传统的邪教没有腐败的邪教那么极端，但他们仍然通过一个奇怪的镜头来看待这个世界，尽管他们知道自己被束缚的力量。一些传统的邪教相信他们的守护者只是被误解了--{@i Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!}其他的则是庆祝他们的守护者的破坏性或混乱的一面，要么相信这个腐败的世界应该被拆毁，要么相信信徒们会在下一个时代得到提升。即使是崇尚{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的邪教徒也不一定是邪恶的；他们可能相信这个腐败的世界必须用血来洗净邪恶，除了对孤儿王的职责外，他们可能是温和的、利他的。",
	"The dark powers associated with the cults of the Dragon Below have much to offer. They can imbue their servants with mystical powers, following the model of the warlock. Daelkyr can provide symbionts and physical transformation, while the Lords of Dust can provide wealth, influence, or ancient artifacts to their loyal agents. As a result, transactional cults often begin as secret societies. People join of their own free will, eager to obtain whatever it is the cult has to offer. But even if someone joins for the most rational of reasons, the influence of a daelkyr or an overlord is difficult to resist; the longer someone remains in the cult, the more power it will have over them.": "与 \"下面的龙 \"邪教有关的黑暗力量有很多东西可以提供。他们可以按照术士的模式，给他们的仆人灌输神秘的力量。戴尔克尔（Daelkyr）可以提供共生体和身体改造，而尘土领主（Lords of Dust）可以为他们忠诚的代理人提供财富、影响力或古代文物。因此，交易型邪教往往以秘密社团的形式开始。人们按照自己的意愿加入，渴望获得邪教提供的任何东西。但是，即使有人出于最理性的原因加入，也很难抵制daelkyr或霸主的影响；某人在邪教中呆得越久，邪教对他们的权力就越大。",
	"Consider the Court of Shadows cult, tied to {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}. A wizard has a fascinating conversation with a colleague, discussing a spell unlike anything they've seen before. The colleague explains that the spell is from Ashtakala's vaults, and if the wizard joins the Court, they'll discover many amazing things about magic and history. So they go to a meeting and are impressed by the scholars and warlocks they meet. Soon they're initiated into the cult, swearing an oath to the Queen of Shadows and being invested as the Knight of the Forgotten Library. It seems like a game, and they're gaining access to fascinating new spells. But as time passes, they become ever more obsessed with rising in the Court of Shadows. The political interplay in the Kingdom of Shadows feels more real, more relevant than the mundane politics of Khorvaire. They pursue missions for the Queen, yearning to win her favor. And they hope that someday the Queen will rise from her slumber, for then, the Kingdom of Shadows will truly become real.": "考虑到影子法庭的邪教，与（%0%）挂钩。一个巫师与一个同事进行了一次精彩的对话，讨论了一个与他们之前见过的不同的咒语。同事解释说，这个咒语来自阿什塔卡拉的金库，如果巫师加入法庭，他们会发现许多关于魔法和历史的神奇之处。于是他们去参加了一个会议，并被他们遇到的学者和术士们所打动。很快，他们就被引入了邪教，向影后宣誓，并被授予被遗忘图书馆骑士的称号。这似乎是一场游戏，他们获得了迷人的新法术。但随着时间的推移，他们变得越来越痴迷于在阴影法庭中崛起。阴影王国的政治互动感觉更真实，比霍尔韦尔的世俗政治更有意义。他们为女王追求任务，渴望赢得她的青睐。他们希望有一天女王会从她的沉睡中醒来，因为那时，阴影王国将真正成为现实。",
	"Transactional cults can be found anywhere on this slippery slope. A transactional cult might use symbiont weapons but otherwise be quite rational. Or, while you can still see how they stumbled into this mess, they could be completely pulled into the warped reality espoused by the cult.": "交易型邪教可以在这个滑坡的任何地方找到。一个交易型邪教可能使用共生体武器，但在其他方面却相当理性。或者，虽然你仍然可以看到他们是如何跌入这个烂摊子的，但他们可能完全被拉入邪教所主张的扭曲的现实。",
	"Transactional cults are typically small, but can be widespread. A coven of the Court of Shadows may only have a few members, but the Court itself is spread across Khorvaire. Often, members of transactional cults know who they are dealing with, but greed or curiosity overrides concerns. However, it's also possible for people to only know part of the story; a warlock might believe that the Queen of Shadows is a mighty warlock or perhaps an archfey, not realizing she's actually an overlord.": "交易型邪教通常规模较小，但也可能很普遍。阴影法庭的女巫团可能只有几个成员，但该法庭本身却遍布霍尔韦尔。通常，交易型邪教的成员知道他们在和谁打交道，但贪婪或好奇心压倒了担忧。然而，人们也有可能只知道故事的一部分；一个术士可能认为阴影女王是一个强大的术士，或许是一个大法官，而没有意识到她其实是一个霸主。",
	"What do the cults of the Dragon Below {@i want}? What do members strive to achieve? This varies based on the structure and patron of the cult. All of the malevolent powers described in this section have loyalists, cults that are devoted to releasing their lords from Khyber or helping their agents (be they Lords of Dust, mind flayers, or rogue dragons) with whatever they require. But beyond the loyalists, cult goals can be a little more exotic.": "下面的龙的邪教{@i want}是什么？成员们努力实现的目标是什么？这根据邪教的结构和赞助人而有所不同。本节所描述的所有邪恶势力都有忠诚的信徒，这些邪教致力于将他们的领主从开伯尔释放出来，或者帮助他们的代理人（无论是尘埃领主、心灵传播者，还是流氓龙）满足他们的任何要求。但除了忠诚者之外，邪教的目标可以更奇特一点。",
	"Corrupted cults usually have some sort of immediate goal that drives the formation and expansion of the cult. {@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!} The goals are often terrible things that must be stopped, but it's not always obvious how they are helping the power behind the cult; these schemes may have nothing to do with the seals of the daelkyr or releasing an overlord. In the case of an overlord, the archfiends gain strength by driving mortals down their paths. For {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, getting mortals to use magic for malevolence strengthens her regardless of what they actually do; likewise, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} revels in all violence. Meanwhile, the daelkyr are truly incomprehensible. They certainly enjoy experimenting with their preferred mediums; one of {@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's} cults could enact a ritual that causes dragonmarks to come to life and attack their bearers, with no purpose beyond satisfying Dyrrn's curiosity. As the daelkyr experience time in a nonlinear fashion, it's also possible that what seems like meaningless chaos could have a unforeseen future—that there will come a time when a living dragonmark unleashed in the cult's bizarre rampage ends up being the vital element needed to defeat one of the Lords of Dust. The key point is that cults of the Dragon Below—particularly corrupted cults—may not have long-term plans; their schemes can and should often appear nonsensical.": "腐败的邪教通常有某种直接的目标，促使邪教的形成和扩张。{@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!}这些目标通常是必须被阻止的可怕事情，但它们如何帮助邪教背后的力量并不总是显而易见的；这些计划可能与daelkyr的封印或释放一个霸主毫无关系。在霸主的情况下，大恶魔通过驱使凡人走上他们的道路来获得力量。对于(1%)来说，让凡人使用魔法进行恶意攻击会让她变得更加强大，而不管他们实际做了什么；同样地，(2%)也沉醉于所有的暴力。同时，daelkyr是真正不可理喻的。他们当然喜欢用自己喜欢的媒介进行实验；其中一个{@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's}的教派可以举行仪式，使龙纹活过来并攻击它们的持有者，除了满足Dyrrn的好奇心之外，没有任何目的。由于daelkyr以非线性的方式体验时间，看似毫无意义的混乱也可能有一个不可预知的未来--有一天，邪教的怪异狂欢中释放的活龙印最终成为击败尘土领主之一的关键因素。关键的一点是，下面的龙的邪教--特别是腐败的邪教--可能没有长期的计划；他们的计划可能而且应该经常显得无稽之谈。",
	"Traditional cults are religions. They aren't driven by short term goals, but instead provide guidelines on how to live your whole life. Traditional cults can be peaceful and innocuous... until they aren't. A particular alignment of moons, a vision sent to the cult leader, a critical mass of outsiders arriving at the same time—any cult could have a set of circumstances that trigger bloody rituals or brutal sacrifices. This is where the absurdity of a traditional cult rises to the surface. The people of Lowholt couldn't be kinder—until the flesh barn runs low on spleen and they have to harvest your organs. {@i It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen}—the \"grandparents\" in this case being the gibbering mouther in the basement.": "传统的邪教是宗教。他们不是由短期目标驱动，而是提供如何生活的指导方针。传统的邪教可以是和平的、无害的......直到他们不是这样。一个特定的月亮排列，一个发送给邪教领袖的幻象，大量的外来者在同一时间到达，任何邪教都可能有一系列的情况，引发血腥的仪式或残酷的牺牲。这就是传统邪教的荒谬之处。洛霍特的人再仁慈不过了--直到肉仓里的脾脏不够用了，他们不得不收割你的器官。{@i It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen}--在这种情况下，\"祖父母 \"就是地下室里那个胡言乱语的人。",
	"Transactional cults are often initially driven by the desires of the members. Someone joins a transactional cult because they want the power to do something—to take revenge on their enemies, to overthrow a tyrant, to destroy a local criminal gang. But the patron always has a price, and this can eventually follow the same model described for corrupted cults earlier.": "交易型邪教最初往往是由成员的欲望驱动的。有人加入交易型邪教是因为他们希望有能力去做一些事情--向敌人复仇，推翻暴君，摧毁当地犯罪团伙。但赞助人总是有代价的，这最终会遵循前面描述的腐败邪教的相同模式。",
	"Each cult of the Dragon Below is tied to a sinister power trapped in Khyber, and a cult's goals usually reflect the power behind it. If the cult has inhuman allies, are they fiends, aberrations, or other monsters? What sort of treasures and magic items does the group use? These magic items aren't necessarily direct gifts from the patron; a cult of Kyrzin may have many potions because the high priest is an alchemist, or because a strange fountain in the temple secretes mystical fluids. In the case of loyalists and traditional cults, the connection to its patron may be quite obvious, whereas corrupted cults can be challenging to identify the hidden manipulator. Regardless of whether cultists know the identity of their patron, the power behind a cult has many effects.": "每一个 \"下面的龙 \"邪教都与困在开伯尔的邪恶力量有关，而一个邪教的目标通常反映了它背后的力量。如果该邪教有非人的盟友，他们是恶魔、反常者还是其他怪物？该团体使用什么样的宝物和魔法物品？这些魔法物品不一定是赞助人的直接礼物；一个Kyrzin教派可能有很多药水，因为大祭司是个炼金术士，或者因为神庙里的一个奇怪的喷泉会分泌神秘的液体。在忠诚者和传统邪教的情况下，与其守护者的联系可能相当明显，而腐败的邪教则很难识别隐藏的操纵者。不管邪教信徒是否知道其赞助人的身份，邪教背后的力量有很多影响。",
	"As a broad rule, cults tied to overlords (Rak Tulkhesh, Sul Khatesh, Katashka, Bel Shalor, the Daughter of Khyber) are either directly helping the Lords of Dust or trying to drive behavior that strengthens the archfiend. The daelkyr (Belashyrra, Dyrrn, Kyrzin, Orlaask, Valaara) are more enigmatic. Their traditional cults may continue strange patterns of behavior handed down for generations, performing sacrifices or mysterious rituals when the planes are aligned. But they can also engage in dramatic actions with no clear benefit to anyone. There's no clear reason for Orlassk to turn citizens of Sharn into gargoyles; it could be an experiment, or simply a form of art. But these actions will be related to the sphere of the daelkyr that causes it, whether that's oozes, stone, eyes, or insects.": "一般来说，与霸主（拉克-图尔克什、苏尔-凯特什、卡塔什卡、贝尔-沙洛尔、凯伯之女）相联系的邪教要么直接帮助尘土领主，要么试图推动加强大火球的行为。daelkyr（Belashyrra、Dyrrn、Kyrzin、Orlaask、Valaara）则更加神秘莫测。他们的传统邪教可能会延续世代相传的奇怪行为模式，在星球排列整齐时进行祭祀或神秘的仪式。但他们也可以从事戏剧性的行动，对任何人都没有明确的好处。奥拉斯克把沙恩的公民变成石像鬼并没有明确的理由；这可能是一个实验，或者只是一种艺术形式。但这些行动会与引起它的daelkyr的范畴有关，不管那是ozes、石头、眼睛还是昆虫。",
	"The ten powers described below reflect the most common cults, but there are many other overlords and daelkyr. There will never be a complete list, and DMs can always develop new powers. Use these as inspiration, but don't feel limited.": "下面描述的十种力量反映了最常见的邪教，但还有许多其他的霸主和daelkyr。永远不会有一个完整的清单，而且DM可以随时开发新的权力。用这些作为灵感，但不要觉得有什么限制。",
	"The brightest soul casts the longest shadow. You can't escape the evil within you. It's always one step behind, waiting for you to miss a step. Even if you keep your footing, do you truly believe that those around you are as strong as you? Are they so virtuous?

	"The overlords embody mortal fears, and Bel Shalor embodies our fear of {@i other mortals}—the eternal suspicion that a stranger means us harm, that even our friends can't be trusted. Bel Shalor thrives on paranoia and feasts when fear drives good people to do terrible things. Wars feed Rak Tulkhesh, but an inquisition that torments countless innocents delights Bel Shalor—especially when carried out by virtuous people. In the third century YK, Bel Shalor nearly escaped his bonds before being bound once more by the sacrifice of Tira Miron, but some sages wonder if Bel Shalor didn't in fact {@i allow} himself to be defeated. Now he is forever tied to Tira, and anyone who can hear the Voice of the Silver Flame can also hear the tempting whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.": "霸主体现了凡人的恐惧，而贝尔-沙洛体现了我们对（%0%）的恐惧--永远怀疑一个陌生人会对我们造成伤害，甚至我们的朋友也不可信。贝尔-沙勒以偏执狂为生，当恐惧驱使好人做出可怕的事情时，他就会大吃一惊。战争为Rak Tulkhesh提供食物，但折磨无数无辜者的宗教裁判所却让Bel Shalor感到高兴--特别是当由有德行的人执行时。在YK第三世纪，贝尔-夏洛尔几乎逃脱了他的束缚，然后被提拉-米隆的牺牲再次束缚，但一些圣人怀疑贝尔-夏洛尔是否事实上{@i allow}自己被打败了。现在他永远被绑在提拉身上，任何能听到银色火焰之声的人也能听到火焰中阴影的诱人低语。",
	"Bel Shalor doesn't encourage savage violence. Instead, he amplifies fears and suspicions while fanning the fires of greed and self-interest. He convinces us that the people around us are cruel and petty; the only way to survive is to strike first, to take what we need regardless of the cost to others.": "贝尔-沙洛尔并不鼓励野蛮的暴力。相反，他放大了恐惧和怀疑，同时煽起了贪婪和私利的火焰。他让我们相信，我们周围的人都是残忍和小气的；唯一的生存方式就是先下手为强，不顾他人的损失，拿走我们需要的东西。",
	"Corrupted cults can appear anywhere; Bel Shalor seizes on a suspicion and amplifies it. The Whispering Flame is a transactional cult hidden within the Church of the Silver Flame—a secret order of priests and templars who do Bel Shalor's bidding in exchange for power and influence. The greatest agents of the Whispering Flame rarely perform obvious acts of corruption themselves; instead, they subtly encourage others to compromise their principles or succumb to their fears.": "腐败的邪教可以出现在任何地方；贝尔-沙洛抓住了一个疑点并将其放大。低语之焰是一个隐藏在银焰教会中的交易性邪教--一个由牧师和圣殿骑士组成的秘密组织，他们听从贝尔-沙洛的命令，以换取权力和影响力。低语之焰最伟大的代理人很少自己进行明显的腐败行为；相反，他们巧妙地鼓励其他人妥协他们的原则或屈服于他们的恐惧。",
	"Bel Shalor's chief agents are {@creature rakshasa}, and his {@i prakhutu} (\"speaker\") on the Council of Ashtakala is known as the Wyrmbreaker.

	"Magic items associated with Bel Shalor typically are used to manipulate others, conceal thoughts, or control shadows.

	"Bel Shalor thrives on manipulating thoughts and emotions.

	"Any fear could be amplified by Bel Shalor and form the basis of a cult. A group of people in a small town might become convinced that there's a {@creature doppelganger} or a {@creature wererat} hidden in the community that has to be rooted out at any cost. Or perhaps it's a fear of foreign spies. Or warforged made to replace humans... can you prove that you're not a warforged imposter? Frequently such cults truly believe that they're protecting the innocent from a serious threat, and don't realize that they are the ones serving a dark power.": "任何恐惧都可能被贝尔-沙洛放大，形成邪教的基础。小镇上的一群人可能会相信，社区里隐藏着一个{@creature doppelganger}或一个{@creature wererat}，必须不惜一切代价将其铲除。也可能是对外国间谍的恐惧。或者是为了取代人类而制造的战神......你能证明你不是一个战神的冒牌货吗？经常有这样的邪教组织真正相信他们在保护无辜者免受严重的威胁，而没有意识到他们是为黑暗势力服务的人。",

Belashyrra's cultists can become obsessed with sight, both unable to believe what they can't see, and utterly convinced of those things they can. They might experience visions others can't see, or gain powers linked with sight, like a beholder's eye rays. The concept of seeing secret things is critical for these cults and typically drives their missions. It's common for devoted cultists of Belashyrra to grow new eyes, as with the Vigilant Eye cult.": "达尔凯尔（%0%）与视觉有关，并可能利用其崇拜者作为探索世界的容器。Belashyrra的崇拜者会对视觉着迷，既无法相信他们看不到的东西，又完全相信他们能看到的东西。他们可能会体验到别人看不到的幻象，或者获得与视觉相关的力量，比如观察者的眼睛射线。看到秘密事物的概念对这些邪教来说至关重要，通常会推动他们的任务。贝拉希拉的忠实崇拜者长出新眼睛是很常见的，就像警戒之眼邪教一样。",
	"Belashyrra has traditional cults in the Shadow Marches; members generally keep to themselves, unless guided by visions or gathering sacrifices. Belashyrra's corrupted cults can appear anywhere, driven by ecstatic visions or convinced that only they can see threats that must be dealt with (such as members of the Vigilant Eye believing they can see hidden demons). Belashyrra's cultists aren't always dangerous; they can be gifted oracles, and sometimes they truly can see threats hidden from others. Belashyrra is also known to be fighting the Umbragen drow beneath Xen'drik.": "Belashyrra在阴影地带有传统的邪教；除非有幻觉的指引或收集祭品，否则成员一般都保持自我。Belashyrra的堕落邪教可以出现在任何地方，他们被狂喜的幻觉所驱使，或者相信只有他们能看到必须处理的威胁（比如警戒之眼的成员相信他们能看到隐藏的恶魔）。Belashyrra的崇拜者并不总是危险的；他们可能是有天赋的神谕者，有时他们真的能看到别人看不到的威胁。众所周知，贝拉希拉也在与Xen'drik下面的Umbragen乌鸦作战。",
	"Belashyrra is the source of beholderkin in Eberron, though they can be found serving other daelkyr or operating independently. Any aberration whose powers revolve around eyes or vision could be tied to Belashyrra.

Symbiont items that grant sight-related abilities will often demand to see certain things; the wearer will simply have a sense that the robe wants to see what's inside that building, and refusing such requests could result in losing the powers of the item until a long or short rest has been completed. In addition to items, Belashyrra can grant supernatural gifts tied to sight, such as granting darkvision or the ability to use {@spell true seeing} once a week; such gifts usually take the form of a new eye manifesting on the victim, with the power only working through that eye.": "任何与视觉有关的魔法物品都可以与贝拉希拉联系在一起，通常以共生体的形式。崇拜者可以拥有有机版的（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）；（%3%）可以由皮革材料制成，与佩戴者的身体结合在一起。赋予视觉相关能力的共生物品往往会要求看到某些东西；穿戴者会简单地感觉到长袍想看看那个建筑里面有什么，拒绝这种要求可能会导致失去物品的能力，直到完成长时间或短时间的休息。除了物品之外，贝拉希拉还可以授予与视力有关的超自然礼物，例如授予暗视或每周使用一次（4%）的能力；这种礼物通常采取在受害者身上显现出一只新眼睛的形式，力量只通过这只眼睛起作用。",
	"Belashyrra can be an excellent patron for a {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} warlock, because typically what it asks of its warlocks is to see things; a warlock will be charged to find something or observe a particular event. Sight-related invocations are common, and spell effects may be channeled through the eyes—either the warlock's natural eyes, or new ones that they manifest. Any character could be guided by visions shown by Belashyrra; a paladin might not follow a god, but rather be driven by the visions of evil Belashyrra shows them. Is Belashyrra guiding them to stop evil, or is the All-Seer mocking them by showing them the evil people do, while the paladin is determined to prevent these visions from coming to pass?": "Belashyrra是一个优秀的{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}术士的守护者，因为它对术士的要求通常是看到东西；一个术士会被要求找到一些东西或观察一个特定的事件。与视觉有关的召唤很常见，法术效果可以通过眼睛来引导--无论是术士的天然眼睛，还是他们所显现的新眼睛。任何角色都可以被贝拉希拉展示的幻象所引导；一个圣骑士可能不会追随一个神，而是被贝拉希拉展示的邪恶幻象所驱动。Belashyrra是在引导他们阻止邪恶，还是全能神通过向他们展示人们所做的邪恶来嘲弄他们，而圣骑士则决心阻止这些幻象的发生？",
	"Due to a cult's actions, people start seeing hidden truths they don't want to know. A wave of visual hallucinations is causing people to see their friends as monsters or deadly enemies. A serial killer is collecting eyes of different species to offer to the All-Seer. A loyalist cult sees signs that reveal one of the adventurers is their next designated sacrifice. An individual or group (such as the Vigilant Eye) is guided by visions leading them to murder hidden demons—are they killing innocents, or could there truly be demons hidden in the community?": "由于邪教的行为，人们开始看到他们不想知道的隐藏真相。一波视觉幻觉使人们把自己的朋友看成怪物或致命的敌人。一个连环杀手正在收集不同物种的眼睛，以提供给全能者。一个忠诚的邪教组织看到了一些迹象，显示其中一个冒险者是他们的下一个指定牺牲品。一个人或团体（如警戒之眼）被幻觉引导着去谋杀隐藏的恶魔--他们是在杀害无辜者，还是真的有恶魔隐藏在社区中？",

	"Of all the cults, this is the one that most truly serves the Dragon Below. Loyalists serve the Daughter of Khyber as the greatest champion of her mother and the harbinger of Khyber's return. Loyalist doctrine maintains that Khyber didn't betray Siberys; instead, she was the one betrayed. Khyber had a grand and glorious vision for reality, but the other Progenitors turned on her. Cultists typically see themselves as being oppressed by laws and systems; like Khyber, they are imprisoned by their inferiors, by people who don't understand their vision for the world, and they will ascend to glory when Khyber rises. Some cults maintain that dragons themselves were the creations of Khyber and were stolen by Siberys and Eberron; under this belief, the Daughter isn't corrupting dragons, but rather restoring them to their rightful role. In any case, loyalists see themselves as warriors in a battle to restore proper balance to reality, heroes who will be elevated in the dark and beautiful reality soon to be revealed through dragonfire and blood.": "在所有的教派中，这是一个最真正服务于下面的龙的教派。忠诚派将开伯尔之女奉为她母亲最伟大的冠军和开伯尔回归的预兆。忠诚派的学说认为，开伯尔并没有背叛西伯利亚，相反，她才是被背叛的人。凯贝尔对现实有一个宏伟而光荣的愿景，但其他祖先却背叛了她。邪教信徒通常认为自己受到法律和制度的压迫；像开伯尔一样，他们被下级囚禁，被那些不理解他们对世界的愿景的人囚禁，当开伯尔崛起时，他们将升入荣耀。一些邪教坚持认为，龙本身就是开伯尔的创造物，被西伯利亚和艾伯伦偷走了；在这种信念下，女儿不是在腐蚀龙，而是将它们恢复到它们应有的角色。在任何情况下，效忠者都把自己看作是为恢复现实的适当平衡而战斗的勇士，他们将在即将通过龙火和鲜血揭示的黑暗而美丽的现实中得到升华的英雄。",
	"Corrupted cultists may share these beliefs. Other common delusions include the idea that cultists are dragons—either transformed and trapped in human form, or inheritors of draconic bloodlines who could someday regain their proper form.

However, there are other cults—such as the Transcendent Flesh—who see Dyrrn's actions in a positive light. Dyrrn transforms and creates new forms of life—but who are we to decide that these things are monsters? Such cultists believe that Dyrrn is driving evolution, and they can transcend their own limits by walking the path of the Foul Labyrinth. While this can start as simply transactional, the influence of the Corruptor is insidious, and cultists can soon start to see natural creatures as vile and weak.": "Dyrrn的效忠者认为，腐蚀者最终会吞噬和改造世界，只有那些为它服务的人才能活下来。然而，也有其他邪教--如超凡肉体--从积极的角度看待Dyrrn的行为。Dyrrn改造并创造了新的生命形式，但我们有什么资格决定这些东西是怪物？这类崇拜者认为，Dyrrn正在推动进化，他们可以通过走 \"污秽迷宫 \"的道路来超越自己的极限。虽然这开始只是简单的交易，但腐蚀者的影响是阴险的，邪教徒很快就会开始将自然生物视为卑鄙和软弱。",
	"Dyrrn has had a long presence in western Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, and the Wardens of the Wood remain ever watchful for its vile creations.

	"Katashka thrives both on the fear of death and fear of the undead. As such, his cults might spread plagues or otherwise cause mass death, or they might unleash ghouls in the sewers or trigger zombie outbreaks. His intent is not death itself—the Grim King draws strength from the {@i fear} of the living. As such, Katashka rarely seeks to kill people swiftly. The primary purpose of the lingering plague is to sow fear among those fighting it, and the small pack of ghouls that causes long-term terror is more effective than an army that wipes out a city in a day. Likewise, Katashka's undead champions revel in their unnatural condition; they want people to know what they are and to fear them.": "卡塔什卡在对死亡的恐惧和对亡灵的恐惧上都很兴旺。因此，他的邪教可能会传播瘟疫或以其他方式造成大规模死亡，也可能在下水道中释放食尸鬼或引发僵尸爆发。他的目的不是死亡本身--狰狞之王从活人的（%0%）中汲取力量。因此，卡塔什卡很少寻求迅速地杀人。挥之不去的瘟疫的主要目的是在与之斗争的人中散播恐惧，而造成长期恐怖的小群食尸鬼比在一天内消灭一座城市的军队更有效。同样，卡塔什卡的亡灵冠军们也陶醉于他们的非自然状态；他们希望人们知道他们是什么，并害怕他们。",
	"The Gatekeeper's cults are often transactional, with cultists serving the Grim King in exchange for secrets of necromancy or undead servants. Corrupted cults will in some way tie to death or the undead; Katashka also produces revenants. Katashka's cults have no established territories, but are actually rarer in Karrnath than elsewhere in the Five Nations, as the Blood of Vol presents a different path to necromantic magic along with a more positive overall message for followers.": "守门人的邪教往往是交易性的，邪教徒为狰狞之王服务，以换取亡灵法术的秘密或不死的仆人。腐败的邪教会以某种方式与死亡或亡灵挂钩；卡塔什卡也生产复仇者。卡塔什卡的邪教没有既定的领土，但实际上在卡尔纳特比五国的其他地方更少见，因为沃尔之血为追随者提供了一条不同的死灵魔法之路，以及更积极的整体信息。",
	"There are some obvious similarities between Katashka and the Keeper, and some scholars assert that they are one and the same—that Katashka's actions in the Age of Demons inspired the myths of the Keeper.

In contrast, priests of the Keeper also deal with general greed, offering deals that have nothing to do with death or undeath.": "卡塔什卡和守护者之间有一些明显的相似之处，一些学者断言他们是同一个人--卡塔什卡在恶魔时代的行为启发了守护者的神话。一个关键的区别是卡塔什卡对不死之身的关注，在某些方面类似于其他环境中奥库斯的角色。相比之下，守护者的祭司也处理一般的贪婪，提供与死亡或不死之身无关的交易。",

Beyond this, the greatest gift Katashka grants his followers is life after death. A champion of Katashka could be repeatedly raised after death, forcing adventurers to find more elaborate ways to prevent their resurrection. His champions could also be returned as undead; only valuable servants are granted a second life as liches or vampires, but lesser cultists could rise after death as zombies or ghouls—an unpleasant surprise for adventurers fighting them!": "卡塔什卡的宝物是消耗生命的工具，比如说（%0%）。他的崇拜者也可能拥有创造或指挥亡灵的工具。除此之外，卡塔什卡给予其追随者的最大礼物是死后的生命。卡塔什卡的冠军可以在死后反复复活，迫使冒险者找到更多的方法来阻止他们复活。他的冠军也可以作为亡灵返回；只有有价值的仆人才会被赋予作为地衣或吸血鬼的第二次生命，但较低级的邪教徒死后可以作为僵尸或食尸鬼复活--这对与他们战斗的冒险者来说是个不愉快的惊喜",

	"Any plotline involving evil undead or power-hungry necromancers can be laid at Katashka's feet; his cults require less nuance than the Blood of Vol. A common theme is the fact that Katashka doesn't simply want to kill innocents, he wants people to fear death and the undead.": "任何涉及邪恶的亡灵或渴望权力的死灵法师的情节都可以放在卡塔什卡的脚下；他的邪教需要的细微差别没有沃尔之血那么大。 一个共同的主题是，卡塔什卡不只是想杀死无辜者，他想让人们恐惧死亡和亡灵。",

It is infamous as the source of all oozes; some believe that there are living rivers of gray ooze and green slime in the depths of Khyber. Many cults revere gibbering mouthers and hear guiding words in the ravings of these beasts; such cults refer to Kyrzin as the Regent of Whispers. While oozes play a major role, its cults can be associated with liquid in any form. One cult might venerate an ancient well, while others say that the local lake holds the ghosts of their ancestors.

While many Marchers know stories of the Prince of Slime, it's typically seen as a dangerous but largely neutral force. Mold plays an important part in Marcher medicine, and the Bile Lord is seen as a force that can cause disease when angered, or help to prevent it. So most prefer to ignore and avoid Kyrzin, and Whisperers are largely left alone.": "Kyrzin的传统邪教在阴影地带得到了牢固的确立，但Whisperers则保持自我。游行者将普通的感冒称为 \"滴水 \"或 \"胆汁领主之吻\"；还有故事说，Kyrzin在牧场的河流中播下了巨大的渗水。虽然许多行军者知道粘液王子的故事，但它通常被视为一种危险但基本中立的力量。霉菌在行军者的医学中扮演着重要的角色，而胆汁领主被视为一种力量，在被激怒时可以导致疾病，或者帮助预防疾病。因此，大多数人宁愿忽略和避免Kyrzin，而低语者基本上不受影响。",
	"In Eberron, Kyrzin replaces Juiblex as the source of {@creature black pudding||black puddings}, {@creature gray ooze||gray oozes}, {@creature gibbering mouther||gibbering mouthers}, {@creature mimic||mimics}, and similar creatures, any of which could be tied to the Prince of Slime. It can also create creatures similar to living spells, though Kyrzin is not responsible for the living spells that roam the Mournland. Its most infamous creations are parasitic oozes, a form of black pudding that can enter a creature's body. More intelligent than their larger kin, these oozes can communicate telepathically with their hosts. An adventurer who kills a weak cultist may have an unpleasant surprise when a deadly parasitic ooze emerges from the corpse! Victims unwillingly bonded to a parasitic slime must find a way to coexist until they can be freed from the creature ({@spell greater restoration} will expel it). If angered, the ooze can eat its way out of the victim, which is usually fatal. Kyrzin is also served by {@creature dolgaunt|ERLW|dolgaunts} and {@creature dolgrim|ERLW|dolgrims}; those created by the Prince of Slime have slimy, translucent skin.": "在Eberron，Kyrzin取代了Juiblex成为{@creature black pudding||black puddings}、{@creature gray ooze||gray oozes}、{@creature gibbering mouther||gibbering mouthers}、{@creature mimic||mimics}和类似生物的来源，其中任何一种都可能与粘液王子有关。它还可以创造类似于活体法术的生物，尽管Kyrzin并不负责漫游在哀牢地的活体法术。它最臭名昭著的创造物是寄生性渗出物，一种可以进入生物体内的黑色布丁形式。比起它们较大的亲戚，这些渗虫更有智慧，可以与它们的宿主进行心灵感应。当一个冒险者杀了一个弱小的邪教徒后，可能会有一个不愉快的惊喜，因为从尸体中出现了一个致命的寄生性的渗出物。不愿与寄生黏液结合的受害者必须找到一种共存的方式，直到他们能够从该生物中解脱出来（（4%）会驱逐它）。如果被激怒了，这种黏液可以从受害者体内吃出来，这通常是致命的。Kyrzin也为{@creature dolgaunt|ERLW|dolgaunts}和{@creature dolgrim|ERLW|dolgrims}服务；那些由粘液王子创造的人有粘稠的、半透明的皮肤。",
	"Kyrzin's cults are well stocked with potions. While they may have standard effects, Kyrzin's potions are often disturbing to look at and may crawl about, ooze-like, if spilled. Kyrzin's symbionts often mimic the effects of magical garments, though they are fluid rather than fabric; Kyrzin's {@item cloak of elvenkind} is an amorphous shroud that shifts to match its surroundings.": "柯尔钦的邪教都有充足的药水储备。虽然它们可能有标准的效果，但Kyrzin的药水往往让人看了很不舒服，而且如果洒出来的话，可能会爬来爬去，像渗漏一样。Kyrzin的共生体经常模仿魔法服装的效果，尽管它们是流体而不是织物；Kyrzin的（%0%）是一个无定形的罩子，会随着周围环境的变化而变化。",
	"An artificer from an old Whisperer family could have an unorthodox approach to alchemy, and their homunculus could be a living ooze. A {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} warlock could specialize in spells dealing with fluids or confusing whispers; even {@spell eldritch blast} could be flavored as flinging globs of mystically charged slime.": "一个来自古老的语者家族的工匠可以对炼金术采取非正统的方法，而他们的同体人可以是一个活生生的渗水。一个{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}的术士可以专攻处理液体或混乱的低语的法术；甚至{@spell eldritch blast}的术士也可以被调教成投掷带着神秘色彩的粘液团。",
	"A cult could do something unusual to the water supply of a town, whether introducing poisons or hallucinogens, or transforming the water into living ooze. Kyrzin's parasitic oozes could spread throughout a town or take over a particular organization—but what do they actually want? Friends of the party could be consumed by a gibbering mouther—but could they still be alive within the slime?": "一个邪教组织可以对一个城镇的供水做一些不寻常的事情，无论是引入毒药或致幻剂，还是将水转化为活的渗水。Kyrzin的寄生渗出物可能会蔓延到整个城镇，或接管一个特定的组织--但他们到底想要什么？党的朋友们可能会被胡言乱语的口水虫吞噬，但他们在粘液中还能活着吗？",

So respect the stone, for it'll still be here long after you've turned to dust.": "石头是不朽的。它听着。它记住了。它选择静止，但任何见过夜行神龙的人都知道，只要它选择，它就能移动。所以要尊重石头，因为在你化为尘土之后，它还会在这里很久的。",
	"The daelkyr Orlassk is the master of stone. Orlassk's traditional cults say that it is the Still Lord who carves out caverns, and that it is the Voice in the Stone that guides the miner to the ore. Orlassk can breathe life into stone, as seen in the {@creature gargoyle}; but it can also turn living creatures into stone, and it's thought that most creatures with this power—{@creature medusa||medusas}, {@creature gorgon||gorgons}, {@creature basilisk||basilisks}, {@creature cockatrice||cockatrices}—are its creations. Cults may associate with such creatures, but they can also venerate stone itself. Orlassk's cultists could venerate a sacred stone that whispers when it's fed fresh blood, or maintain a deep chamber where all the secret knowledge of the cult is engraved into the walls.": "daelkyr Orlassk是石头的主人。奥拉斯克的传统崇拜说，是静止的主宰开凿了洞穴，是石头中的声音引导矿工找到了矿石。奥拉斯克可以将生命注入石头，如{@creature gargoyle}；但它也可以将生物变成石头，人们认为大多数具有这种能力的生物--{@creature medusa||medusas}、{@creature gorgon||gorgons}、{@creature basilisk||basilisks}、{@creature cockatrice||cockatrices}--都是它创造的。崇拜者可能会与这种生物联系在一起，但他们也可以崇尚石头本身。奥拉斯克的崇拜者可以崇拜一块神圣的石头，当它被喂食新鲜血液时，它就会发出低语，或者维护一个深邃的密室，将崇拜者的所有秘密知识刻在墙上。",
	"Orlassk is one of the lesser known daelkyr. Its cults are found where people live around stone, in high mountains and deep caves. Orlassk's corrupted cults often form around those who work with stone: masons, sculptors, stone giants, or even just people who dwell in stone towers. When the walls start whispering to you, Orlassk has found you.": "奥拉斯克是较少为人所知的达尔凯尔之一。它的邪教是在人们生活在石头周围的地方，在高山和深山洞穴中发现的。奥拉斯克的堕落邪教往往围绕着那些与石头打交道的人形成：石匠、雕塑家、石头巨人，甚至只是住在石塔里的人。当墙壁开始对你说悄悄话时，奥拉斯克已经找到了你。",
	"Orlassk is thought to have feuds with other daelkyr. Orlassk and Kyrzin are fundamentally opposed: solid against liquid, static against change.

	"Orlassk is tied to creatures of stone, both those made of stone and those that petrify. The {@creature medusa||medusas} of Cazhaak Draal in Droaam deny any connection to Orlassk, but it may have {@creature medusa} cultists elsewhere in Khyber. Orlassk has many {@creature gargoyle} servants in exotic variations. It employs creatively twisted earth elementals. Orlassk's {@creature dolgrim|ERLW} and {@creature dolgaunt|ERLW} minions have a rocky skin texture and can stand still indefinitely.": "奥拉斯克与石头的生物有关，包括那些由石头制成的生物和那些石化的生物。德罗亚姆的卡扎克-德拉尔（%0%）否认与奥拉斯克有任何联系，但它在开伯尔的其他地方可能有（%1%）的崇拜者。奥拉斯克有许多(2%)具有异国情调的仆人。它创造性地使用了扭曲的土元素。奥拉斯克的{@creature dolgrim|ERLW}和{@creature dolgaunt|ERLW}爪牙拥有岩石般的皮肤纹理，可以无限期地站立。",
	"Any form of magic item that is related to stone can be associated with Orlassk.

	"While most of the Orphan King's cults are driven by ruthless aggression, they could also believe they are serving a greater good. A corrupted cult might truly be determined to bring down bandits that are preying on innocents; they are simply driven by the delusion that there are no other alternatives to bloodshed. Another common delusion is that the current world must be cleansed in bloody battle to clear the path for a peaceful world—these cultists are only fighting today so that their children may know peace tomorrow.": "虽然大多数 \"孤儿王 \"的邪教都是被无情的侵略所驱使，但他们也可能认为自己在为更大的利益服务。一个堕落的邪教组织可能真的决心打倒那些掠夺无辜者的强盗；他们只是被一种错觉所驱使，即除了流血之外没有其他选择。另一个常见的错觉是，必须在血腥的战斗中清洗当前的世界，为和平的世界扫清道路--这些邪教分子今天的战斗只是为了让他们的孩子明天能知道和平。",
	"The Rage of War has a particularly strong following among the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, but he has drawn strength from the Last War and cults can be found anywhere in the Five Nations, especially in communities that suffered serious losses during the war.

But Rak Tulkhesh's forces are primarily mortal. In addition to the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, many of the {@creature minotaur||minotaurs} of Droaam revere Rak Tulkhesh in the guise of the Horned Prince.

The {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} warlock is a possible path for a cultist bound to Rak Tulkhesh; your weapon could be an artifact from the Age of Demons, forged by Mordakhesh the Shadowsword.

Sul Khatesh has no need of mortal souls, but a cultist might believe they have sworn their soul to her. What truly delights her is when magic is used for cruel purposes or in ways that cause people to fear it. While cultists may forge a bond for rational reasons, the more people that draw on her gifts, the more that corruption can creep in. Members of the Court of Shadows believe that they are part of a shadow kingdom that becomes more real with each day; some members even believe they can see its towers and spires overlapping the structures of the real world. Other cults may become obsessed with their own power, embracing the idea that those who can do magic are superior to those who cannot—that it is their right to prey on these mundane cattle. Given her love of secrets, the cults of Sul Khatesh are almost always hidden and subtle.

The primary question for such a warlock is whether you still serve her—whether you are seeking to rise in the Court of Shadows even as you go about your adventuring career—or whether you regret the bargain that you made and are trying to find a way out. Any spellcaster could have received a boon from Sul Khatesh even if they don't have the close bond of a warlock; did she teach you your first spell in your dreams, and are you afraid she'll return to call in this favor?

A cult of Sul Khatesh could be at the center of a web of blackmail that's tearing a city apart.

Victims of Valaara's delusions may believe that they are insects transformed into human form, or that they are being controlled or consumed by parasites. Its most widespread cult calls itself the Hive; members of this sect surrender their individuality to serve the collective, with mammals acting as if they're insects. The question when dealing with the Hive is whether it's solely a delusion and the victims can be saved, or whether the cultists truly have been consumed from within by Valaara's children, and are simply wearing human shells.": "daelkyr Valaara与昆虫和各种爬行的害虫一起工作。它的孩子们就在我们周围，在墙壁里倾听，吞噬我们的死者。在创造新的和致命的昆虫和蛛形纲动物的同时，瓦拉拉也在进行昆虫意识的实验，将一个人形的思想扩散到多个身体上。瓦拉拉妄想症的受害者可能会相信他们是转化成人形的昆虫，或者相信他们被寄生虫控制或吞噬。它最广泛的邪教自称为 \"蜂巢\"；这个教派的成员放弃他们的个性，为集体服务，哺乳动物的行为就像他们是昆虫一样。处理 \"蜂巢 \"的问题是，这是否只是一种错觉，受害者可以被拯救，或者这些邪教分子是否真的被瓦拉拉的孩子从内部吞噬，而只是戴着人类的外壳。",
	"Beyond the Hive, Valaara's cults invariably interact with insects in some way. Some believe they are receiving divine messages hidden in the buzzing of insects. Others cultivate massive hives of telepathic insects or create charnel pits as a breeding ground for maggots.": "在蜂巢之外，瓦拉拉的崇拜者总是以某种方式与昆虫互动。有些人相信他们收到了隐藏在昆虫嗡嗡声中的神圣信息。其他人则培养了大量有心灵感应的昆虫蜂巢，或创造了炭疽坑作为蛆虫的滋生地。",

Swarms, {@creature spider||spiders}, {@creature scorpion||scorpions}, and other similar creatures can be found with Valaara's cults. However, as with all the daelkyr, Valaara takes natural things and makes them unnatural. When using a relatively mundane insect as a base creature, consider what you can add to making it unnatural.

It creates symbionts that burrow into the flesh of the host; two of its gifts are the {@item throwing scarab|ExploringEberron} and the {@item spellburrow|ExploringEberron}, both presented in chapter 7.": "瓦拉拉创造壳质盔甲和活体武器。它创造的共生体可以钻进宿主的肉里；它的两个天赋是（%0%）和（%1%），都在第七章中介绍。",

	"A plague of unnatural locusts is stripping the land; what is drawing the insects here? A sect of the Hive is spreading through a squalid part of town, but are they preying on innocents, or are new members joining of their own free will? An insect follows the adventurers, whispering their secrets; is it a single warped creature, or just one drone from a telepathic hive?": "一场非自然的蝗虫瘟疫正在侵蚀这片土地；是什么吸引了这些昆虫？蜂巢的一个教派正在城镇的一个肮脏的地方蔓延，但他们是在掠夺无辜者，还是新成员自愿加入？一只昆虫跟着冒险者，低声说着他们的秘密；它是一个单一的扭曲的生物，还是只是一个心灵感应的蜂巢中的一个无人机？",
	"Members of the cults of the Dragon Below aren't always evil, and cults aren't always pursuing malevolent ends.

But what does it mean to be a barbarian drawing power from the Rage of War?": "下龙城的邪教成员并不总是邪恶的，而邪教也不总是追求恶毒的目的。上一节为玩家角色提供了大量与特定邪教有联系的想法。但是，作为一个从战争之怒中汲取力量的野蛮人意味着什么呢？",
	"Ultimately, the question is: what do you want it to mean? Do you want to play a character who knowingly serves a sinister power? Do you want to highlight the idea that while others see the power you deal with as evil, you interact with it in a positive way?

	"There are sources of divine magic that are concrete and clear—the Silver Flame is a pool of energy that binds the overlords, and spellcasters can divert its power for other purposes. There are other sources that are less certain—are the Sovereigns the deities their followers believe them to be, or is the power of a Sovereign cleric simply drawn from the power of collective belief? And then there's a third kind of source, where divine spellcasters draw power from devotion to forces that clearly are not divine and have no obvious way to grant such power. How is it that a warforged paladin can draw power from their devotion to the Lord of Blades when the Lord of Blades doesn't wield such power himself? Is a cleric of the Dragon Below actually receiving their power from a daelkyr, and if so, how?": "神圣魔法的来源是具体而明确的--银色火焰是束缚霸主的能量池，施法者可以将其力量转移到其他用途。还有一些来源不太确定--君主是他们的追随者认为的神，还是君主教士的力量仅仅来自于集体信仰的力量？还有第三种来源，即神圣的施法者从对显然不是神圣的力量的奉献中汲取力量，而且没有明显的方法来授予这种力量。当刀锋之主本身并不拥有这种力量的时候，一个战地圣骑士怎么能从对刀锋之主的奉献中汲取力量呢？低地之龙的牧师是否真的从戴尔基尔那里获得了他们的力量，如果是的话，是如何获得的？",
	"Ultimately, these questions don't need an absolute answer; after all, the most basic principle of divine magic is that it's not scientific and can't be absolutely explained. But here are a few ways to approach such spellcasters.": "归根结底，这些问题不需要一个绝对的答案；毕竟，神圣的魔法最基本的原则是它不科学，不能被绝对解释。但这里有几种方法可以接近这种施法者。",
	"The most common theory advanced by theologists in Eberron is that people with exotic or implausible beliefs who wield divine magic are actually drawing that power from another source without realizing it—that their faith is so strong that an actual existing power answers the prayer. Phthaso Mogan of Sharn has written a treatise in which he describes a man who performed miracles based on his fanatical devotion to his own shoe. Mogan concluded that the man was actually receiving his power from Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Travel. But while it's possible to draw spells from worshiping a shoe, this would be extremely rare. Though the cause is debated, scholars recognize that the more similar your target of worship is to an archetypal Sovereign, the more likely you are to be granted divine magic. And thus, over the ages, civilizations have gravitated toward worshiping a variation of the Sovereign Host.": "Eberron的神学家们提出的最常见的理论是，拥有异乎寻常或难以置信的信仰的人在挥舞着神圣的魔法时，实际上是在不知不觉中从另一个来源汲取了这种力量--他们的信仰是如此强烈，以至于一种实际存在的力量回应了祈祷。沙恩的Phthaso Mogan写了一篇论文，他在其中描述了一个基于对自己鞋子的狂热奉献而创造奇迹的人。莫根的结论是，这个人实际上是从旅行的主宰者科尔-科兰那里得到他的力量。但是，虽然有可能从对鞋子的崇拜中获得法术，但这将是极其罕见的。虽然原因尚有争议，但学者们承认，你崇拜的目标与典型的主权者越相似，你就越有可能被赋予神圣的魔法。因此，随着时间的推移，各种文明都倾向于崇拜一个变种的主宰者。",
	"Mogan also proposed that clerics of unusual faiths may actually receive their spells from the Traveler, who might support such ideas to cause chaos and undermine faith in established traditions. Korranberg scholar Dravo Den Talas has proposed an alternate theory: that if there is any truth to the beliefs of the Blood of Vol, {@i all} divine magic could be drawn from the mystic spark of the caster. According to Talas, the actual belief is irrelevant; it is purely the strength of faith that matters.": "莫根还提出，不寻常信仰的教士实际上可能从旅行者那里得到他们的法术，而旅行者可能会支持这样的想法，以造成混乱，破坏对既定传统的信仰。科兰伯格学者德拉沃-丹-塔拉斯提出了另一种理论：如果沃尔之血的信仰有任何真实性，（%0%）神圣的魔法可以从施法者的神秘火花中汲取。根据塔拉斯的说法，实际的信仰并不重要，重要的纯粹是信仰的力量。",
	"Regardless of what they conclude, the various theories generally acknowledge that a paladin who worships the Lord of Blades doesn't actually have to draw their power from the Lord of Blades himself. The power might come from within the paladin, it could be ultimately drawn from Dol Dorn or Onatar—or even be a gift of the Traveler.": "不管他们的结论如何，各种理论普遍承认，崇拜刀锋之主的圣骑士实际上不一定要从刀锋之主本人那里汲取力量。这种力量可能来自圣骑士的内心，也可能最终来自多尔多恩或奥纳塔，甚至是旅行者的礼物。",
	"Ultimately the distinction between divine spellcasting and arcane spellcasting is a question of flavor. There's nothing that says a paladin has to be considered to be a divine spellcaster. A kalashtar cleric could present their {@spell command} as psychic ability, while a paladin from a cult of the Dragon Below could describe Divine Smite or Lay on Hands as being empowered by a disturbing symbiont that encases the arms of the paladin. Warlocks and barbarians might seem more thematically appropriate for many of the cults of the Dragon Below, but the same concept can be applied to clerics or paladins; while they are driven by their faith, their powers are based on gifts, physical mutations, or otherworldly revelation, as opposed to coming as a literal answer to prayer.": "归根结底，神圣法术和奥术法术之间的区别是一个味道的问题。没有什么规定说一个圣骑士必须被认为是一个神术师。一个卡拉什塔教士可以把他们的（%0%）说成是通灵能力，而一个来自龙下邪教的圣骑士可以把 \"神圣打击 \"或 \"动手 \"说成是由包裹在圣骑士手臂上的一个令人不安的共生体赋予的。术士和野蛮人在主题上似乎更适合许多龙下之城的邪教，但同样的概念也可以适用于牧师或圣骑士；虽然他们受信仰驱使，但他们的力量是基于天赋、身体变异或其他世界的启示，而不是作为祈祷的字面答复。",
	"The Sovereign Host is by far the dominant faith of Khorvaire, followed by the Church of the Silver Flame, which has churches and shrines all across the Five Nations. While the Blood of Vol is a distant third, it has been well established in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities for over a thousand years. However, there are many other religions in the world. These include the druidic traditions of the Eldeen Reaches, the kalashtar Path of Light, and other faiths described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. In addition, players and DMs can always develop new religions, either as traditions that have recently appeared or as obscure faiths that have few followers. A few examples of uncommon religions are provided below.": "到目前为止，主权主机是霍尔韦尔最主要的信仰，其次是银焰教会，它的教堂和圣地遍布五国。虽然沃尔之血是遥远的第三位，但它在卡尔纳特和拉扎尔公国已经有一千多年的良好基础。然而，世界上还有许多其他宗教。这些宗教包括Eldeen Reaches的德鲁伊传统、卡拉什塔的光明之路，以及{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}中描述的其他信仰。此外，玩家和DM可以随时发展新的宗教，要么是最近出现的传统，要么是很少有信徒的晦涩的信仰。下面提供了几个不常见的宗教的例子。",
	"The warforged (creation, evolution, ascension)": "战神（创造、进化、升华）",
	"This small cult believes that the souls of the warforged flow from a greater spiritual power. Those who follow the path of the Becoming God believe that House Cannith was merely a tool of the Becoming God; Cannith created bodies, but it was the God that shared its essence and gave the warforged life. Followers believe that each warforged holds a divine spark, that their people have a destiny, and that when they work as one, they can change the world. Followers seek to ensure a positive future for the warforged race, seeking to reactivate the old creation forges or to find a new way to create warforged. The faithful are also charged with helping to build a physical body for the Becoming God itself, and a community of warforged in the Mournland labors toward this aim. It could be that this vessel will be a vast form that dwarfs even the warforged colossi, but perhaps the Becoming God's size doesn't matter, only its perfection. Followers of the faith may receive visions of objects that must be located and brought to the Mournland to help with this quest.": "这个小邪教相信，战神的灵魂来自于一种更强大的精神力量。那些追随成神之路的人相信坎尼斯家族只是成神的一个工具；坎尼斯创造了身体，但却是成神分享了它的本质并赋予了战神的生命。追随者相信每个战神都拥有神圣的火花，他们的人民有一个命运，当他们团结一致时，他们可以改变世界。追随者们寻求确保战神种族的积极未来，寻求重新激活旧的创世锻炉或找到创造战神的新方法。信徒们还负责帮助为 \"成神 \"本身建立一个实体，而在哀伤之地的一个战锻人社区正朝着这个目标努力。这个容器可能是一个巨大的形式，甚至使战神巨像都相形见绌，但也许成神的大小并不重要，重要的是它的完美性。信仰的追随者可能会收到一些物品的幻象，这些物品必须被找到并带到哀牢地，以帮助完成这项任务。",
	"The cult of the Becoming God is notably less violent than the followers of the Lord of Blades. The faithful are determined to protect the warforged and help them reach their full potential, but they generally believe that it's possible to work with creatures of flesh and blood, and harmony is better than strife.": "成神的崇拜者明显没有刀锋之主的追随者那样暴力。信徒们决心保护战神，帮助他们充分发挥潜力，但他们普遍认为，与血肉之躯的生物合作是可能的，和谐比纷争更好。",
	"Destiny, divination": "命运，占卜",
	"Priests of the Draconic Prophecy embrace the idea that there is a guiding force underlying reality, and that they can see glimpses of its divine plan. A priest of the Draconic Prophecy believes that their divine powers are granted to keep the Prophecy on its proper path—that when a cleric uses {@spell cure wounds} to save a comrade, it's because that person isn't destined to die today. When they cast a spell such as {@spell commune}, it doesn't contact an extraplanar entity, but reveals a cryptic glimpse into the Prophecy itself.": "Draconic Prophecy的牧师接受这样的观点：现实中存在一种指导性的力量，他们可以看到其神圣计划的一瞥。Draconic预言的牧师相信他们的神力是为了保持预言的正确方向--当牧师使用{@spell cure wounds}来拯救一个同伴时，那是因为这个人今天注定不会死。当他们施展诸如{@spell commune}这样的法术时，并不是与一个星外实体联系，而是揭示了预言本身的一个隐秘的一瞥。",
	"Despite having priests, this isn't an organized religion and there are no clearly established traditions. It's a calling, and each champion must find their own path. Priests of the Prophecy are often set in opposition to forces that seek to manipulate the Prophecy and to use it for their own ends, notably the fiendish Lords of Dust.": "尽管有祭司，但这不是一个有组织的宗教，没有明确的既定传统。这是一种召唤，每个冠军必须找到自己的道路。预言的祭司们经常与那些试图操纵预言并将其用于自身目的的势力相对立，特别是邪恶的尘土领主。",
	"The warforged (conquest, revenge)": "战神(征服、复仇)",
	"The Lord of Blades is a warforged insurgent. He asserts that the warforged were created as tools and weapons, but now it is time for their former masters to reap the harvest they have sown. Some of his most devoted followers—who call themselves Blades—believe that there can be no peace between the warforged and creatures born of flesh and blood, and that there will come an apocalyptic reckoning between the two. They don't believe the Lord of Blades to be a god, but they do consider him to be a divine champion. There is a parallel here to the Becoming God, as the Blades believe the Lord of Blades is the vessel for the spirit of their people, the fulcrum of their destiny; the primary difference is that the followers of the Becoming God seek peaceful coexistence, while the Blades devotedly believe in both conquest and vengeance.": "刀锋之主是一名战锻人叛乱者。他宣称，战神是作为工具和武器被创造出来的，但现在是他们以前的主人收割他们所播种的成果的时候了。他的一些最忠实的追随者--他们自称为 \"刀锋\"--相信在战神和血肉之躯的生物之间不可能有和平，而且两者之间会有一场世界末日般的清算。他们不相信刀锋之主是神，但他们确实认为他是一个神圣的冠军。这里与成神有相似之处，因为刀锋战士相信刀锋之王是他们民族精神的容器，是他们命运的支点；主要区别是成神的追随者寻求和平共处，而刀锋战士则忠实地相信征服和复仇。",
	"Due to the antagonism between Blades and creatures of other races, this path would be an unusual choice for a player character, unless the entire party of adventurers is comprised of warforged. However, it's possible a Blade paladin could be pursuing a sacred mission—perhaps searching for a particular artifact or the secret of how new warforged can be created—that requires them to find a way to peacefully work alongside creatures of flesh. Perhaps along the way, they will conclude that coexistence is possible.": "由于刀锋战士和其他种族的生物之间的对立，这条道路对玩家角色来说是个不寻常的选择，除非整个冒险者队伍都是由战神组成的。然而，刀锋圣骑士有可能在追求一项神圣的任务--也许是在寻找一件特殊的神器，或者是寻找如何创造新的战神的秘密--这需要他们找到一种与肉体生物和平共处的方法。也许在这个过程中，他们会得出结论，共存是可能的。",
	"While the Blades believe that conflict is inevitable, they aren't fools, and few are bloodthirsty or cruel. Most Blades are combat veterans with tactical experience, and know better than to simply attack every human they encounter; when they act, they strike strategic targets and have a plan of attack. At the moment, there are working toward acquiring strategic resources, developing weapons, and striking at those perpetrating injustice toward the warforged. They may make bloody examples of their enemies, but most acts of violence are carefully planned.": "虽然刀锋战士认为冲突是不可避免的，但他们并不是傻瓜，很少有嗜血或残忍的人。大多数刀锋战士都是有战术经验的战斗老兵，他们知道最好不要简单地攻击他们遇到的每一个人类；当他们采取行动时，他们会打击战略目标并有一个攻击计划。目前，他们正在努力获取战略资源，开发武器，并打击那些对战神不公的人。他们可能会对他们的敌人进行血腥的杀戮，但大多数的暴力行为都是精心策划的。",
	"Nara smiled as she faced the assembled fiends. \"You're the ones who are outnumbered.\" Her spectral wings unfolded from beneath her cloak, rainbow feathers casting light across the chamber. \"All of the champions of the Silver Flame are with me, and no evil can stand against our power.\"": "娜拉微笑着面对聚集在一起的魔鬼们。\"你们才是寡不敌众。\" 她的幽灵翅膀从她的斗篷下展开，彩虹般的羽毛在房间里投射出光芒。\"所有银色火焰的冠军都和我在一起，没有任何邪恶可以对抗我们的力量。\"",
	"Divine magic is usually the product of deep faith and unyielding conviction, but an {@race aasimar|VGM} has a direct tie to a source of divine power and receives guidance from a celestial entity. Usually, these gifts aren't hereditary, and you can't necessarily identify an aasimar in Eberron by their appearance; there is no single recognized trait that defines an aasimar, and no reliable way of producing one. While the existence of aasimar may seem to fly in the face of Eberron's distant gods, it's important to remember that an aasimar needs no direct connection to a deity. An aasimar draws power from a divine energy source, and their spiritual guide is a celestial being—an angel, a couatl, or similar spirit. The aasimar may be marked as a champion of the faith, but even they can't prove the existence of the Sovereigns.": "神圣的魔法通常是深刻的信仰和不屈的信念的产物，但{@race aasimar|VGM}与神圣力量的来源有直接的联系，并接受天体的指导。通常情况下，这些天赋是不会遗传的，在Eberron，你不一定能通过他们的外表来识别Aasimar；没有一个公认的特质来定义Aasimar，也没有可靠的方法来产生一个Aasimar。虽然阿西玛人的存在似乎与Eberron的遥远的神灵格格不入，但重要的是要记住，阿西玛人不需要与神灵有任何直接联系。阿西玛人从神圣的能量源中获取力量，他们的精神向导是一个天人--天使、库阿特尔，或类似的精神。aasimar可能被标记为信仰的拥护者，但即使他们也不能证明主权者的存在。",

Fernian aasimar typically have crimson skin, and eyes or hair that burn with cold flame. Use the variant {@race aasimar (scourge variant; fernian)|ExploringEberron|Fernian aasimar} provided in chapter 6. Your guide drives you to provide comfort to the frightened and to battle forces of darkness. Fernian aasimar are often sorcerers wielding elemental flame; the {@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE} sorcerous origin is a good option to reflect your tie to your angel, or you can use the red dragon {@class sorcerer||Draconic Bloodline|draconic} origin, describing your features as angelic rather than draconic.": "你的向导体现了火的积极方面：提供光明和温暖的火焰，驱赶黑暗。费尔尼安-阿西玛尔通常拥有深红色的皮肤，以及燃烧着冷焰的眼睛或头发。使用第六章中提供的变体（%0%）。你的向导驱使你为受惊吓的人提供安慰，并与黑暗势力作战。Fernian aasimar通常是挥舞着火焰元素的巫师；{@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE}巫师出身是一个很好的选择，以反映你与你的天使的联系，或者你可以使用红龙{@class sorcerer||Draconic Bloodline|draconic}出身，将你的特征描述为天使而非龙人。",

Use the variant {@race aasimar (fallen variant; mabaran)|ExploringEberron|Mabaran aasimar} provided in chapter 6. Your guide still inspires you to follow the principles of its plane of origin, but it's fighting against Mabar's overwhelming despair and a hunger to drain the light and life from mortal creatures; when you use your Consuming Touch, you're channeling this energy to your guide. Your guide might hope you can someday release it from Mabar, though no immortal has ever escaped its corruption before. Or it could simply encourage you to follow the general principles of its plane of origin—balanced against its growing hunger and despair.

	"When Galifar was established, the province of Breland was granted dominion over all lands south of the Byeshk Mountains and west of the Seawall, extending to the waters of the Thunder Sea. This bold claim considerably extended the territory held by the preceding nation of Wroat—but it was nothing more than a claim. The Brelish people had no need of the lands to the west, nor did they want them. The Barrens—their name for everything west of the Graywall Mountains—were known to hold foul swamps and barren plains, an untamed region filled with all manner of deadly monsters. Explorers to Breland's newly acquired territory soon confirmed these tales. The plains were filled with goblins and hungry gnolls. The mountains were home to harpies whose songs could lead the unwary into deep chasms, where trolls slept on piles of bones. The Barrens had nothing the Brelish believed worth fighting for, and so it was left alone. Occasionally, questing knights or bold templars would cross the Graywall to battle giants and slay ogres, but the region was largely ignored.": "加利法尔建立时，布雷兰省被授予对拜什克山以南和海堤以西的所有土地的统治权，并延伸到雷海的水域。这一大胆的要求大大扩展了之前的Wroat国家所拥有的领土，但这只不过是一个要求而已。布雷利什人不需要西部的土地，他们也不想要它们。荒原--他们对灰墙山以西的一切的称呼--众所周知，那里有肮脏的沼泽和贫瘠的平原，是一个充满各种致命怪物的未驯服地区。前往布雷兰德新获得的领土的探险家们很快证实了这些传说。平原上到处都是地精和饥饿的地精。山区是女妖的家，她们的歌声会把不小心的人带入深渊，而巨魔则睡在成堆的骨头上。荒原上没有任何布雷利什人认为值得为之战斗的东西，所以它被冷落了。偶尔，探险的骑士或勇敢的圣殿骑士会穿越灰墙，与巨人作战，杀死食人魔，但这个地区基本上被忽视了。",
	"Over centuries, the Brelish slowly expanded west toward the Graywall. Castle Arakhain became a favored royal residence in the eighth century, bringing new prosperity to Ardev and Shavalant. However, the ensuing wave of western settlers was met by fierce raiders crossing the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake. Bloodied settlers brought back tales of bellowing minotaurs, orcs, ogres, and goblins lurking in every shadow. An attack at Castle Arakhain led to the brief Westward War, the might of Galifar driving the raiders back across the Graywall and obliterating many of the marauding bands. The fortress Orcbone was established as the gate between the people of Breland and the monsters of the Barrens, and the king founded the Westwind Riders to patrol the border. The Riders held the line throughout the ninth century, and Brelish settlers even staked claims along the Graywall. This period peaked with the founding of the fortress-town of Stubborn in the foothills (now known as Stonejaw). Then the Last War changed everything.": "几个世纪以来，布雷利什人慢慢向西边的灰墙扩张。阿拉哈因城堡在第八世纪成为了受人青睐的皇室居所，给阿德夫和沙瓦兰特带来了新的繁荣。然而，随之而来的西部定居者的浪潮遭到了穿越灰墙山脉和银湖之间的凶猛突袭者的袭击。鲜血淋漓的定居者们带回了关于咆哮的牛头人、兽人、食人魔和潜伏在每个阴影中的妖精的故事。对阿拉卡因城堡的攻击导致了短暂的西进战争，加利法尔的力量将袭击者赶回了灰墙，并消灭了许多掠夺者。兽骨要塞被确立为布雷兰德人与荒原怪物之间的大门，国王成立了西风骑士团，在边界巡逻。骑士们在整个第九世纪都坚守着这道防线，布瑞利什的定居者们甚至在灰墙沿线提出了要求。这一时期的顶峰是在山脚下建立了要塞城镇Stubborn（现在称为Stonejaw）。然后，最后一场战争改变了一切。",
	"The land known as the Barrens is far older than Galifar or Wroat. While less fertile than the fields of Breland or Aundair, this region holds rich mineral deposits. Some believe it was the original homeland of the goblinoids, a theory supported by a significant number of Dhakaani ruins along and below the mountain ranges, as well as below the Great Crag itself. In the Graywall Mountains, a set of thousand-foot statues commemorate the six kings who came together to form the ancient Empire of Dhakaan. But while this region may have once been important to the dar, it was utterly devastated in their war against the daelkyr, compounded by the return of forces long held at bay by the empire. Vicious gnolls swarmed south from the Towering Wood. Fierce orcs emerged from the western swamp. Trolls and ogres came down from the mountains. Those dar that remained were infected with daelkyr curses; instead of standing together against the invaders, they turned on each other, and centuries of chaos and bloodshed followed. By the time it was done, all that remained of Dhakaan was ruins. Hobgoblins and bugbears had been eradicated in the region, and goblins were scattered and divided.": "被称为荒原的土地远比加利法尔或沃罗特更古老。虽然没有布雷兰德或昂代尔的田地那么肥沃，但这个地区拥有丰富的矿藏。有些人认为这里是妖精的原始家园，这一理论得到了沿山脉和山脉下的大量达卡尼遗迹以及大峭壁本身的支持。在灰墙山脉，有一组千尺雕像纪念六位国王，他们共同组成了古代达卡尼帝国。但是，虽然这个地区可能曾经对达尔人很重要，但在他们与达尔人的战争中却遭到了彻底的破坏，再加上长期被帝国牵制的势力的回归，使之变得更加复杂。凶恶的地精从高耸的森林向南涌来。凶猛的兽人从西部的沼泽地里出现。巨魔和食人魔从山上下来。那些留下来的达尔人被daelkyr的诅咒所感染；他们没有站在一起对抗入侵者，而是互相攻击，几个世纪的混乱和流血随之而来。当一切结束时，达卡安只剩下了废墟。霍布林和虫族已经在该地区被根除，妖精们被分散和分裂。",
	"The region was dominated by anarchy from then on—some believe this merely follows the natural instincts of the region's inhabitants, while others point to the lingering influence of the daelkyr. There were a few bastions of civilization—the Venomous Demesne, the hidden village of Lost—but the people of these communities had no interest in expanding their culture; they were either fortified, hidden from the outside world, or both. Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as \"chieftain,\" but it literally means \"boss\" or \"big person\"—and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll—a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind. But while powerful, these creatures lacked the ambition or drive to build anything that could last. Occasionally a more intelligent leader—a minotaur warlord, a charismatic oni—would build a greater force, perhaps even establish a dynasty that would last a generation or two before being overwhelmed by the relentless, brutal tide.": "从那时起，该地区就被无政府状态所支配--有些人认为这只是遵循该地区居民的自然本能，而其他人则指出daelkyr的影响挥之不去。有几个文明的堡垒--毒妖院、隐蔽的迷失村--但这些社区的人对扩展他们的文化没有兴趣；他们要么筑起了防御工事，要么对外界隐藏起来，或者两者都有。在荒原的其他地方，历史被无数强大的奇布的崛起和衰落所标记。奇布是一个哥布林术语，有时被翻译成 \"酋长\"，但它的字面意思是 \"老板 \"或 \"大人物\"--而在荒原上，奇布往往只是周围最大的生物。通常情况下，一支队伍会围绕食人魔、艾丁或巨魔形成--一种足以对哥布林、哥布林或较小的同类生物宣示其意志的生物。但是，虽然强大，这些生物缺乏野心或动力来建立任何可以持久的东西。偶尔，一个更聪明的领导者--牛头人军阀，一个有魅力的鬼怪--会建立一个更强大的力量，也许甚至会建立一个王朝，在被无情的、残酷的潮流所淹没之前持续一两代。",
	"As the Last War began, the harpies held the Byeshk Mountains, where their flights endlessly feuded. Cazhaak Draal was in the hands of the medusas that claimed it centuries earlier. Wise creatures knew to avoid the Watching Woods, home to worgs and worse. In the plains, the strongest leader was the minotaur warlord Rhesh Toraa; around her keep, countless minor chibs fought one another more frequently than they struck the settlers.": "当最后的战争开始时，哈皮人占据了拜什克山，他们的飞行在那里无休止地争斗。卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）在几个世纪前被梅杜莎人占领。聪明的生物知道要避开观察之林，那里是虫子和更坏的人的家。在平原上，最强大的领袖是牛头人军阀雷什-托拉（Rhesh Toraa）；在她的堡垒周围，无数的小怪兽互相争斗，比他们袭击定居者还要频繁。",
	"The first days of the Last War led to a reduction of forces in the west of Breland; while it was a violent, unstable region, there were few settlers across the Graywall needing protection. Not all of the Westwind Riders were Brelish, and with Wroaan's coronation, soldiers returned to serve their home nations, and Wroaan needed all the troops she could muster. She reduced the Westwind Riders to a minimal force—enough to patrol between the fortresses of Orcbone and Stubborn, but little more.": "最后战争的最初几天导致布雷兰西部的部队减少；虽然这是一个暴力、不稳定的地区，但灰墙对面需要保护的定居者很少。并非所有的西风骑士都是布瑞尔人，随着沃罗安的加冕，士兵们回到了自己的国家效力，而沃罗安需要她能召集的所有部队。她将西风骑士团的兵力减少到最低限度--足以在兽骨堡垒和顽固堡垒之间巡逻，但也仅此而已。",
	"Many Aundairians had been part of the Westwind Riders, and on receiving their reports, Spy Master ir'Galanatyr saw an opportunity. The Royal Eyes of Aundair worked with Rhesh Toraa and other chibs in the Barrens, providing equipment and training to support attacks against Graywall settlers and raids across the gap. With forces tied up to the east, it was up to the commanders of Orcbone and Stubborn to protect the west. But ultimately, the provocateurs from Aundair and Karrnath found the Barrens raiders undisciplined and impossible to unify, never posing the dire threat Breland's enemies had hoped for.": "许多Aundair人曾是西风骑兵的一部分，在收到他们的报告后，间谍大师ir'Galanatyr看到了一个机会。Aundair的皇家之眼与Rhesh Toraa和荒原上的其他部落合作，提供装备和训练，以支持对灰墙定居者的攻击和跨越缺口的袭击。由于部队被束缚在东部，保护西部就要靠兽骨和顽固派的指挥官了。但最终，来自Aundair和Karrnath的挑衅者发现，巴伦斯的袭击者缺乏纪律，无法统一，从未构成布瑞兰的敌人所希望的可怕威胁。",
	"The fortress-town of Stubborn survived decades of raids and skirmishes, as the chibs of the Barrens had no patience for sieges and no weapons for breaking strong walls. Many lesser settlements and claims were overrun and lost, but Stubborn repelled countless attacks by goblins and minotaurs. However, it was utterly unprepared for the force that struck it in the last decade of the war. A typical band of raiders might include a single troll or a handful of ogres, but in 986 YK, the soldiers of Stubborn found themselves facing phalanxes of armored trolls fighting with deadly skill, and squads of ogres acting with discipline and coordination. Stubborn's defenders leapt off the walls in pursuit of harpies' songs, and the walls were shattered by hurled stones. Survivors were herded into the plains to face the leaders of the army; this was the first recorded encounter with the assembled Daughters of Sora Kell, three enigmatic hags discussed in depth later in this chapter.": "斯特伯恩要塞镇在几十年的袭击和小规模冲突中幸存下来，因为荒原上的赤匪对围攻没有耐心，也没有武器可以打破坚固的城墙。许多较小的定居点和领地被攻破并失去了，但斯图本击退了地精和牛头人的无数次进攻。然而，在战争的最后十年里，它对袭击它的力量完全没有准备。一个典型的突击队可能包括一个巨魔或少数食人魔，但在公元986年，顽固派的士兵发现他们面对的是以致命技巧作战的装甲巨魔方阵，以及以纪律和协调行动的食人魔方阵。斯特伯恩的守卫者在追寻哈皮斯的歌声中跃下城墙，城墙被投掷的石块击碎。幸存者被驱赶到平原，面对军队的首领；这是第一次有记录的与索拉-凯尔的女儿们的相遇，这三个神秘的女巫在本章后面将深入讨论。",
	"\"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\" Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"": "\"告诉你们的统治者，西部有一股新的力量，\"索拉-卡特拉告诉顽石的人们。\"你们称之为荒原的地方，我们现在称之为德罗阿姆。灰墙之外和Byeshk之下的土地属于我们的人民。迅速撤出你们的，尊重我们的要求；下一次，将没有幸存者。\"",
	"Once news of the fall of Stubborn reached Orcbone, the Westwind Riders traveled west in full force. But Sora Katra was true to her word; there were no survivors, nor any records of the last battle of the Westward Riders. A retaliatory strike from Droaam—merely a fraction of the forces at Stubborn—inflicted terrible damage on Orcbone itself. King Boranel swiftly deployed all the soldiers he could spare to this new front, reinforcing and fortifying Orcbone. In 987 YK, he formally ordered all Brelish citizens to withdraw from the lands west of Graywall, but he refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Daughters, and over the next decade, clashes continued.": "斯特伯恩陷落的消息一传到奥克本，西风骑士就全力向西行进。但索拉-卡特拉言出必行；没有幸存者，也没有任何关于西风骑士最后一战的记录。来自德罗阿姆的报复性打击--仅仅是斯特伯恩部队的一小部分--对奥克邦本身造成了可怕的破坏。博拉内尔国王迅速将他能抽出的所有士兵部署到这条新的战线上，加强并巩固了奥克邦。公元987年，他正式命令所有布莱里什公民撤出灰墙以西的土地，但他拒绝承认女儿国的主权，在接下来的十年里，冲突不断。",
	"To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere—and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya's Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya's Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved—that Maenya's lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation—but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.": "对于灰墙山脉以东的人们来说，索拉-凯尔的女儿们似乎是突然出现的，而对于荒原上的手足们来说，感觉也差不多。但有证据表明，这是多年、甚至几十年计划的结果。训练现在被称为玛尼亚之拳的巨魔和食人魔花了多长时间？女儿们是如何获得这支部队所挥舞的盔甲和武器的？有人说，索拉-玛尼亚在拜什克山下深处一个被遗忘的达卡尼堡垒里集结了她的部队，她在这个古老的铸造厂里监督了他们武器的锻造过程。索拉-梅尼亚称梅尼亚之拳的士兵为她的孩子，一些学者认为这可能是真的；她的战争巨魔和碎颅食人魔都比他们的普通表亲更聪明，更有能力。但这样的努力需要多长时间？科兰伯格图书馆的梅里安-米特-达万迪提出了一个理论，即半平面可能参与其中--缅因亚在开伯尔的巢穴可能存在于正常的时间流之外，使女儿们的计划既是最近的发展，又是几代人的努力。索拉-泰拉扎在公元985年接触了石像女王和毒液神殿的领主，女儿们在这段时间内为兹尼尔协议的一半雇佣兵提供了中介服务。没有人知道女儿们花了多长时间来准备--但公元986年，她们的存在才被人所知。",
	"Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with—and dominated—the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.": "在进攻顽固派之前，女儿们与荒原上最强大的力量对话，并且支配了这些力量。平原上的赤匪只懂得武力，而女儿们展示了武力；分散的突击队被迫屈服，那些拒绝向索拉-凯尔的女儿们屈服的人被以可怕的方式处决。",
	"In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region's most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient—when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters—Maenya's Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.": "公元987年，索拉-凯尔的女儿们将该地区最强大的领导人召集到现在被称为大峭壁的废墟上。在那里，索拉-凯尔提出了新国家的蓝图，任命了军阀并规定了他们的职责和区域。这个新国家最伟大的城市的工作开始了。灰墙、大峭壁和港口城市弗拉基克。古老的顽固堡垒被重新利用，并更名为石爪。虽然一些突击队被留下来沿袭他们的老路，但许多人被吸收到新国家。成千上万的地精和哥布林从压迫他们的阶级中解放出来，在新的城市中获得了机会。这个新的秩序由兹尼尔条约的地精维和人员来维持。当这被证明是不够的时候--当一个奇布拒绝释放他们的俘虏或藐视女儿们的时候--马恩雅的拳头就会降下来摧毁他们。这个信息很简单。改变即将到来。你可以在德罗阿姆找到自己的位置，也可以选择被消灭。",
	"The Daughters' ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam—at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Gargoyles and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. In Sharn, the Gargoyle replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable.": "女儿们的雄心勃勃的计划因与塔拉什克家族的结盟而得到加强。对塔拉什克来说，这提供了获得德罗阿姆丰富的矿产资源和畸形的雇佣兵服务的机会，这为该家族开辟了一条全新的道路。对女儿们来说，这将她们与一个在东方具有合法声音和影响力的势力联系在一起。塔拉什克的代理人说服了十二门徒会向德罗阿姆开放贸易--至少是向灰墙这个新城市开放。该家族帮助组织劳工，建造新的城市。通过Tharashk，Droaam的居民开始出现在整个五国，尽管在Orcbone附近的紧张局势仍在继续。夜行神龙和鹰身人在沙恩找到了自己的位置。在费尔哈文和沃罗特可以找到食人魔劳工。在沙恩，夜行神龙取代了八风之神中的蝙蝠。今天，五国的许多公民仍然对这些生物感到不舒服，但它们的存在正在慢慢变得不那么引人注目。",
	"The Daughters of Sora Kell sent representatives to Thronehold for the treaty negotiations, demanding to be recognized as a sovereign nation. This petition was denied. In practice, Droaam its territory. But legally, the land is still part of Breland. It's debatable whether the Droaamites are legally invaders or rebels defying the Brelish crown, but either way, they aren't considered citizens of Breland and aren't entitled to the protections of the Code of Galifar. However, their standing outside the law makes them a haven for war criminals, dissidents, deserters, and others who can find no place in the Five Nations.": "索拉-凯尔的女儿们派代表到王座镇参加条约谈判，要求被承认为一个主权国家。这一请求被拒绝了。实际上，德罗阿姆其领土。但在法律上，这块土地仍然是布雷兰德的一部分。值得商榷的是，德罗阿姆人在法律上是入侵者还是反抗布雷利什王室的叛军，但无论如何，他们都不被视为布雷兰的公民，无权享受加利法尔法典的保护。然而，他们在法律之外的地位使他们成为战犯、持不同政见者、逃兵和其他在五国中找不到位置的人的天堂。",
	"Most of the leaders of the Five Nations are convinced that Droaam won't last—that it's unstable, that these monsters will turn on each other any day now. They might be right; the Daughters have already had to crush a number of rebellious warlords and lesser chibs. But after eleven years, Droaam is stronger than ever. Its new cities are expanding. Dragonmarked houses are exploring their opportunities in the region. One important question still remains unanswered: What do the Daughters of Sora Kell want? Will they attack Breland in force if their demands aren't soon met? Or is there some grander scheme, tied to the prophetic visions of Sora Teraza?": "五国的大多数领导人都相信，德罗安不会持久--它不稳定，这些怪物随时都会反目成仇。他们可能是对的；女儿们已经不得不粉碎了一些反叛的军阀和较小的奇布。但在十一年后，德罗阿姆比以前更强大了。它的新城市正在扩张。龙纹屋正在探索他们在该地区的机会。有一个重要的问题仍未得到解答。索拉凯尔的女儿们想要什么？如果他们的要求不能很快得到满足，他们会不会大举进攻布雷兰？还是有什么更宏大的计划，与索拉-泰拉扎的预言相联系？",
	"While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride—driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. \"Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!\"": "虽然德罗安的所有公民都为索拉-凯尔之女服务，但每个地区都由一个军阀以女儿的名义独立管理，而在他们之下，奇布统治着当地社区。所有公民都被期望在被召唤时为他们的国家服务，并做任何被要求的事情。作为对忠诚和服务的交换，他们得到了食物、住所和自豪感--部分原因是他们知道自己在蔑视东方的傲慢国家。德罗亚姆的人民被鼓励相信他们是辉煌事物的一部分，这个事物还没有完全形成。\"今天可能很困难，明天可能更困难。但看看我们在一个十年里做了什么，想象一下我们在下一个十年里会取得什么成就！\"",
	"Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs—miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.": "在Droaam，一些公民有具体的、明确的工作--工人、石匠、士兵。其他人则是普通劳动力的一部分，可能每天都在换工作。这在不断扩张的大城市中尤其如此。然而，Droaam还不是一个高度组织化的官僚机构，如果你选择这样做，很容易从缝隙中溜走。在大城市中，许多公民追求自己的事业。那些看起来懒散的人或惹是生非的人被新闻帮派扫地出门，但那些显示出产业和对城市有贡献的人基本上被忽略了。归根结底，Droaam仍然是一个前沿阵地；这个国家只有十年的历史，它的城市仍在建设之中，还有许多变化尚未到来。",
	"While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist—ground meat made of troll flesh—that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder—the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.": "虽然许多外人可能认为德罗阿姆的制度听起来很压抑，但其大多数公民都真诚地致力于他们的新国家。在女儿们之前，他们的生活是残酷的、丑陋的。现在，他们拥有所有能吃的磨碎的巨魔肉，在当地的大厅里有一个屋顶和一张床，最重要的是，他们有了目标感。妖精可能会在矿场度过他们的一天，但他们知道他们正在建设一个伟大的城市，而不仅仅是为一个粗鲁的食人魔首领的粗鲁的想法服务。此外，许多市民真正敬畏索拉-凯尔的女儿们，在恐惧和惊奇之间取得了谨慎的平衡--对索拉-梅尼亚和她的拳头的实际恐惧，以及由索拉-卡特拉的话语激发的梦想。卓雅姆的人们知道索拉-凯尔的女儿们是传奇，她们拥有难以言喻的力量，而且索拉-泰拉扎知道未来会发生什么。大多数人真正相信，德罗阿姆有一个宏伟的命运，他们将藐视世界的期望，并且他们将共同建立一个辉煌的东西。",
	"Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.": "德罗亚姆有几种异国语言，从兹尼尔契约地精的喋喋不休到通过蛇的嘶嘶声和编织声相互交流的梅杜莎人。然而，这个地区曾经被达卡安帝国所统治，哥布林语长期以来一直是贸易的通用语言。几乎每个德罗阿姆人都会说哥布林语，或者至少能听懂。",
	"When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.": "当使用Droaamish生物的状态块时，你通常应该用哥布林来代替巨人或兽人。德罗亚姆的食人魔和巨魔与使用巨人语言的Xen'drik没有关系。兽人语言在几千年前就已经被淘汰了，如今在霍尔韦尔几乎已经绝迹，尽管可能有一个加兰兽人社区还在说这种语言。",
	"Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common—and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.": "通用语被用作一种贸易语言，在现代，除了哥布林语之外，许多生物也讲通用语。即使在女儿们到来之前，东部荒原的人们也经常因为与布莱里什定居者和西风骑士的交流而知道一点普通话。今天，女儿们正在鼓励普通话的传播，甚至已经开始在灰墙和大峭壁提供定期的语言课程，因为了解普通话对于商业和可以作为塔拉什克雇佣兵的生物来说是很有用的。归根结底，要由DM来决定一个特定的生物是否应该说普通话，如果是的话，它应该说多少。一个NPC有可能只知道一些特定的普通话短语，或者一个玩家角色将不得不进行魅力（（%0%））检查来向一个几乎不懂这种语言的生物传达他们的意思。",
	"Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.": "识字在Droaam较为文明的地区很普遍。梅杜莎人、铁弗林人和变种人一般都识字，从事商人或特使工作的人也一样。但目前，大部分普通民众都是文盲，这与五国不同，在五国，教育长期以来被视为一项基本权利。",
	"While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in {@i muut} or {@i atcha}, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms {@i chaat'oor} or {@i gath'dar} to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use {@i aravaat}—easterner—to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it.": "虽然Droaamites会说哥布林语，但他们并不像本章后面讨论的达卡尼人那样；他们对（%0%）或（%1%）没有兴趣，也不使用许多其他与达卡尼文化相关的词汇。值得注意的是，他们不使用{@i chaat'oor}或{@i gath'dar}这些术语来指代人类和他们的亲属。相反，他们用{@i aravaat}--easterner来指代五族人，更广泛地指代人类、半身人、矮人、精灵和类似物种。大多数德罗阿姆人不屑于学习霍尔韦尔不同国家的名称。西部是阴影地带，是塔拉什克的家乡，也是索拉-卡特拉的故乡。北部是高耸的森林，是索拉-迈尼亚的故乡。其他都是东方，这就是大多数人真正关心的东方。",
	"The nation of Droaam, which has only existed for eleven years, has a general structure established, but it's constantly evolving. The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice.

	"For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city—though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent. Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse—foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.": "目前，每个军阀都有权力统治他们的领地，并按照他们认为合适的方式组织自己的军队。无论是官僚还是士兵，都没有一个标准化的系统；在以前的荒原，最强大的地方官员仍然被称为chib，尽管他们可能不再是社区中最大或最有身体威胁的生物。在多个物种并存的城市中，普通民众被划分为士兵、熟练工人和普通劳动力；这些人由当地的奇布组织并在其直接领导下。这样的城市有一个磨坊（在本节后面讨论）和一系列的兵营，为所有工人提供食物和共同的住所。除非你有宝贵的技能或令人印象深刻的职位，否则你不会拥有财产，但你可以在任何城市找到免费的食物和住所--尽管由于城市仍在扩张以满足容量，在许多地方，这种住所就是帐篷里的床单。卡特拉的愿景是Droaam的所有生物都能一起工作，成为更大整体的一部分。理想情况下，努力工作的劳动者应该不用担心被虐待--工头们不应该心血来潮地殴打（或吃掉）他们的工作人员，这是对荒原生活的改进。卡特拉希望工人们的努力能得到尊重，就像戈林达尔人在凯奇达卡人中受到尊重一样。但是，虽然女儿们提倡这一理想，但在实践中并不总是奏效；仍然有lheshat残酷地对待工人。即使在工人受到良好待遇的地方，也会有这样的认识：任何挑战女儿会或军阀的人都会被毫不留情地击垮。",
	"In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:": "在任何特定的lheshat，军阀管理着他们的领地，而他们下面的兄弟们则领导着每个社区。但有三种力量在这个系统之外运作，直接为女儿们工作，并在整个土地上行使权力。",
	"The agents of {@b Katra's Voice} are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra's Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings, and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.": "{@b Katra's Voice}的代理人是特使和艺人、外交官和调解员。他们的任务是维持士气和沟通渠道，并在争端失控之前帮助解决。卡特拉之声的大多数代理人都是变种人，但也可以找到梅杜莎人、铁弗林人，甚至是哈皮人担任这一角色。许多人专注于他们作为艺人的角色，与普通人分享故事，描绘未来的光明前景。其他人则更注重调解和司法行政，特别是在奇布和劳工之间发生动乱时。",
	"A few elite soldiers of {@b Maenya's Fist} usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.": "一些精锐的{@b Maenya's Fist}士兵通常伴随着卡特拉之声的使者；如果声音不能抚平麻烦，拳头会结束它们。这些装甲巨魔和食人魔是致命的，并且完全献身于女儿们；一个战争巨魔可以粉碎一队不服从的牛头人。",
	"The agents of {@b Teraza's Eye} are sages, versed in the region's history and diverse customs. They survey ancient ruins and identify manifest zones and planar conjunctions. They often offer unsolicited advice to local warlords. Though the smallest of the three branches, some believe that those Eyes that are seen are merely the tip of the ankheg—that Teraza is served by changelings and other hidden agents who carry news of all developments back to the Daughters.": "{@b Teraza's Eye}的代理人是圣人，精通该地区的历史和各种习俗。他们勘察古代遗迹，识别显灵区和平面交汇点。他们经常向当地军阀提供不请自来的建议。虽然是三个分支中最小的一个，但有些人相信，那些被看到的眼睛仅仅是安克赫的一角--泰拉扎被变化者和其他隐藏的代理人所服务，他们将所有发展的消息带回女儿们那里。",
	"These names are the titles both of the organization and its officers; an agent acting on official business simply says, \"I am Teraza's Eye, and you will tell me what transpired here.\"": "这些名字既是该组织的头衔，也是其官员的头衔；执行公务的代理人只需说：\"我是Teraza的眼睛，你要告诉我这里发生了什么。\"",
	"Droaam isn't bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.": "Droaam不受加利法尔法典的约束，也没有统一的司法法典。因此，除非卡特拉之声推翻他们，否则正义完全掌握在当地长老手中。每个部落都有自己的卫兵部队。在一个小村庄里，这可能是一小撮加阿拉姆兽人，但在灰墙这样的大城市里，卫兵是一支多才多艺的重要力量：兽人、牛头人和食人魔，还有哈皮人和巨妖的支持。任何一个主要社区都有一支兹尼尔地精的驻军。这些雇佣兵在需要时充当维和人员，但他们直接为女儿会服务，而不是为奇布服务；在某种程度上，他们的存在是为了阻止奇布背叛女儿会。",
	"Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers—anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall—but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.": "归根结底，Droaam是一个狂野的边疆。在大多数情况下，法律很简单：不要招惹女儿国的人或任何属于女儿国的东西。警卫们并不关心随机的街头斗殴或酒吧斗殴。他们不关心是否有人偷了你的钱包。他们对一个逃犯在其他地方可能违反了什么法律不感兴趣。然而，他们确实关心对建筑物的重大破坏，或任何可能导致多个劳动者死亡的情况--任何威胁到社区整体生产力的事情。因此，玩家角色在Droaam可以逍遥自在，只要他们小心谨慎。当哨兵元帅逮捕躲在灰墙的战犯时，当地的守卫不会干涉，但当罪犯雇佣的三个巨魔袭击元帅时，他们也不会干涉。最重要的是，卫兵们要保护城镇和士兵；在德罗阿姆，个人权利和财产对低等公民来说意义不大。如果你想要正义，你通常必须自己制定它。",
	"In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.": "在大多数社区中，对严重的犯罪行为，法官会立即执行死刑。对于较轻的罪行，受害者会被打上烙印，要么被严刑拷打，要么被打成残废，要么接受战斗审判；大多数大城市都有一个竞技场，可以达到这个目的（尽管人们也可以选择成为角斗士）。那些在惩罚中幸存下来的人被释放了。",
	"There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it—but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice—but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.": "对于那些寻求正义的人来说，有一个求助渠道。卡特拉之声包括有权主持正义的治安法官。行政官在较小的社区之间穿梭，而较大的社区，如灰墙，则有一个常驻行政官。目前的时尚是，地方法官是medusas。如果地方法官认为一个案件有价值，她会命令法官处理它--但如果她认为投诉是轻率的，她会让原告石化。因此，很少有人冒着风险去寻求正义--但对于劳动者来说，知道他们可以这样做，是一种安慰。",
	"Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.": "灰墙有一个相当大的外国区，Calabas。灰墙的illithid军阀Xor'chylic授予Tharashk家族的Kundran Torrn起诉在Calabas犯下的罪行的权利；这意味着在该地区，Galifar法典的大部分内容具有影响力。这一制度可以适用于其他拥有相当多东部人口的社区。",
	"A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; {@i everyone} clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her—he needs to know better—but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.": "在考虑Droaam的法律和秩序时，要记住几个基本原则：虽然当地的卫兵一般不干涉街头的随意打斗，但致命的暴力并不像外人想象的那样常见。有一条不言而喻的规则，即大型生物拥有路权；地精知道要让开巨魔的道路。当然，也有例外；{@i everyone}为梅杜莎开出一条路。除此之外，大多数生活在大城市的德罗阿姆人都想成为卡特拉计划的一部分。巨魔知道，这些小妖精虽然很烦人，但应该是她的小兄弟。如果一个小兄弟推她，她会给他一记耳光，他需要知道更多--但她不会出手杀他，也不会吃他。如果你与巨魔作对，它可能会用爪子砍你；但如果你立即表示忏悔，冲突就会结束。相反，如果一群东方人开始挑衅，德罗阿姆人觉得对这些外来者没有这样的义务；即使卫兵不干涉，其他市民也可能会干涉，而聪明的人类在一个充满怪物的城市里保持低调。",
	"Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey—and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.": "怜悯和同情在Droaam是陌生的概念，既不期待也不提供。正义和复仇之间没有什么区别，如果你想得到这两种东西，你很可能必须抓住它。这个世界被分割成捕食者和猎物--做捕食者总是更好。活到最后是一种胜利，拥有住所和食物应该被庆祝，而不是被认为是理所当然。Droaam的人们是那些他们认为是朋友的坚定盟友，并为保护他们所爱的东西而战斗。但他们对陌生人的命运毫不关心：如果保护一个朋友意味着给陌生人带来痛苦，那就这样吧。",
	"Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.": "在创建Droaam的人物时，请记住这一点。如果你对陌生人很残忍，那是因为你认为这个世界是一个残酷的地方。你可能会追求高尚的目标，成为任何人都希望得到的最可靠的朋友，但你出生在一个残酷的世界，这是你唯一知道的生活。",
	"This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.": "这个残酷的世界正在发生变化。女儿们悬挂着一个更好的世界的梦想；卡特拉敦促德罗阿姆人把所有的战友都当成家人。为女儿们服务，你就会有食物和住所。但这一切都被这样一个事实所平衡：如果你挑战他们，他们会毫不留情地击垮你。而对大多数德罗阿姆人来说，这是一个非常合理的安排。",
	"Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth—so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage—\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"—adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam—or is perhaps even an ally—there won't be a bounty on its teeth.": "德罗亚姆没有既定的货币；日常劳动的标准报酬是食物和住所。大多数Droaam人依靠以物易物的方式购买商品、熟练劳动力或奢侈品。然而，主要城市的大多数商人接受东方的硬币，以及两种次要的 \"货币\"。矿工们经常使用小块的贵金属或宝石碎片进行交易。用带有赏金标记的牙齿进行交易和赌博也很常见。索拉-凯尔的女儿们（通过奇普斯）对某些危险的动物提供赏金，按牙齿支付。每颗牙齿上都会刻上一个哥布林符号，以识别它来自哪种动物，但大多数商人都不会接受牙齿，除非他们亲自认出该牙齿--所以你不能在狼牙上刻上 \"狼 \"字。虽然DM可以把标有赏金的牙齿当作另一种形式的硬币--\"老妖精提供了三颗流离兽的牙齿，价值10银\"--但杀死危险怪兽的冒险者可能会想知道他们的牙齿的赏金是什么。DM可以在《地下城主指南》第7章中的 \"个人宝藏表 \"上滚动，以确定对任何CR的生物提供的赏金。然而，牙齿的货币是基于女儿们对每个赏金的价值，而不是每个生物都有一张金口。一些危险的生物可能有很高的价值，而另一些则毫无价值。赏金是一种鼓励消除威胁的方式，如果一个生物没有威胁到Droaam的人民，或者甚至可能是一个盟友，那么它的牙齿就不会有赏金了。",
	"While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter—any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.": "虽然以物易物可能比用钱币交易更耗时，但这也是一个引入有趣的冒险钩子的机会。也许一个地精商人不能为一块铂金找钱，但她提供了一张废旧的牛皮纸作为交换；它看起来像一张地图，她说它来自城市的下面。达卡尼人的遗物、达尔凯尔战争的古怪残余、布瑞利什逃亡者当掉的东西--这些东西对提供它的人来说可能不值一提，但对接受它的人来说却是无价之宝。",
	"Droaam's main exports—brokered through House Tharashk—are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!": "Droaam的主要出口产品是通过Tharashk家族的中介--来自山区的byeshk和其他矿石，来自平原的Eberron碎片，以及其人民的雇佣兵服务。但它也是不光彩的商品的来源，这些商品在五国中通常是非法的。毒药是一个简单的例子，但还有其他更奇特的物质。龙血在{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}的第四章有描述。勇气是一种兴奋剂，可以使使用者在避免受到惊吓的拯救动作上获得优势；然而，长期使用会导致妄想症，并可能使人处于紧张的恐怖状态中。血杜松子酒是一种坏死的麻醉剂，由马巴兰显灵区的浆果在因暴力而死亡的人的血液中发酵而成；它在回放受害者生命的最后时刻时能引起欣快感，但经常使用它的人会做可怕的噩梦。这些只是几个例子，Droaam有许多其他地方找不到的非自然物品。它是异域生物的器官和皮毛的来源，这些可能是制造魔法物品的关键部件；如果你需要luecrotta的眼睛，灰墙市场可能是你最好的机会。德罗亚姆的市场还接收来自土匪的战利品，以及来自五国的逃兵、战犯和叛徒的零碎物品。总而言之，你永远不知道你会在地精市场上找到什么!",
	"In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the {@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron} table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne.": "在描述Droaam的商品时，要考虑到整个地区可以找到的大量风格和质量，其中一些在{@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron}表格中有所描述。荒原突袭者没有铁匠，用木头和石头的简单武器作战，或者用昂代尔或卡尔纳特提供的装备作战。然而，女儿们一直在努力改善这种状况，在许多更多的城市中可以找到地精和冥王的工匠工作。而毒液之神是一个神秘的先进社会；虽然他们缺乏坎尼斯家族的工业能力，但他们却能熟练地生产出超越五国的魔法珍品。德罗亚姆人使用的大多数魔法物品都来自于该王国。",
	"Droaam is a tapestry of many cultures with diverse beliefs. The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Demesne believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.": "德罗亚姆是一个由多种文化组成的织锦，有着不同的信仰。牛头人尊崇一个被称为 \"角王子 \"的存在，但每个部族都有自己对其守护神的私人称呼。妖怪们说他们用怒火的声音唱歌，但他们相信怒火是艾伯伦诞生世界时发出的痛苦呼喊。失落的变种人相信自己是旅行者的选民。兹尼尔契约的地精拒绝向任何神或魔物低头，而毒妖院的术士领主则认为神或魔物之间没有区别；只有可以被约束或讨价还价的力量。",
	"Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed—an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.": "尽管存在这种巨大的多样性，但整个地区对黑暗六神都有广泛的认可。虽然每个不同的亚文化都有自己偏爱的神灵和个人的扭曲，但大多数人都知道卡扎克信条的基本原则--由卡扎克-德拉尔的冥想家们对主权者和六神进行的解释。德罗亚姆的每个多元文化城市都有许多与小道相关的神龛和偶像，但真正的神庙是阴影之一，很可能是由美杜莎祭司打理。",
	"The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered \"monsters\" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.": "卡扎克信条》承认主权者的存在，但把他们描绘成对其崇拜者提出要求却不给予任何东西的暴君。相比之下，黑暗六人组支持自由和公平交换。根据该信条，影子是所有被东方人视为 \"怪物 \"的人的守护者。奥雷恩和九人组囤积了他们的力量，而暗影则给了它的孩子们奇妙的礼物：梅杜莎的目光、巨魔的再生、食人魔的力量。因此，影子是那些寻求神灵指引或干预的人最常召唤的神灵。",
	"Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find {@i your} path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species—from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.": "总的来说，卡扎克信条赋予黑暗六人组同样的价值，就像五国的皮里奈信条一样，但它将这些概念视为美德。阴影是野心的主宰，帮助你找到（%0%）通往权力的道路，即使这意味着在路上踩到别人。怒火是本能的主宰，如果你拥抱你的情绪，她会引导你度过难关；她也是复仇的主宰，这只是正义硬币的另一面。嘲笑者展示了通往战斗胜利的道路，即使这需要你拥抱背叛或恐惧；在Droaam，勇气和荣誉在胜利和生存面前是次要的。吞噬者挥舞着荒野的力量；他筛选出弱者，但那些经受住他考验的人却变得强大。守护者的祭司们执行殡葬仪式，这些仪式因物种而异--从使体弱者石化以便他们永远不死的梅杜莎人，到吃掉死者的巨魔和食人魔。祭司还充当治疗师，因为疾病和感染是守护者的工具，而祭司可以花钱消除它们。守护者是财富和贪婪的君主，他的祭司们总是愿意帮助请愿者提出交易。除了变革者之外，旅行者很少被直接崇拜，但它总是被承认。",
	"All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.": "所有这些都在《Droaam》中以许多微小的方式得到了回应。例如，狂欢是专门为 \"愤怒 \"举行的狂喜庆典，参与者被鼓励放弃一切克制，拥抱他们的情感。在战斗中，许多德罗阿姆人将杀戮献给守护者，希望通过为君主的囤积物增加灵魂来赢得青睐；同样，将意外之财的一部分献给守护者也是一种习惯，这样他就不会嫉妒了。",
	"Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.": "尽管（或因为）有许多不同的信仰和做法，德罗阿姆人还是非常纵容他人的信仰。Znir地精鄙视恶魔，但不干涉牛头人或铁弗林的做法。哈比人不与梅杜莎人争论愤怒的本质；他们知道真正的答案，这就足够了。每个人一般都尊重影子，即使这对不同的人意味着不同的事情。这个原则一般也适用于东方人。德罗亚姆人认为崇拜主宰者是愚蠢的，但如果你召唤奥里昂，也不会感到不安，而且不在乎卡拉什塔或精灵的信仰。",
	"There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam—the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone.": "对Droaam的宗教宽容有一个例外--银焰教会。教会认为他们的使命是保护无辜者免受超自然的威胁，而德拉姆的许多居民被视为 \"超自然的威胁\"。银色火焰已经带领许多突袭和任务进入荒原，黑暗族群不会很快忘记狼人的大清洗。任何公开佩戴银色火焰标志的人都会受到大多数德罗阿姆人的敌视，而且明智的做法是永远不要独自徘徊。",
	"Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn't feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.": "为什么荒原上的人们要花这么长时间来建造伟大的城市？在某种程度上，这是因为他们无法养活这样一个城市的人口。许多德罗阿姆的居民都是食肉动物，而那些不是食肉动物的人则缺乏大规模农业所需的纪律，无法养活像今天在灰墙或大峭壁发现的那些大量人口。这个简单的食物问题使荒原的人口受到控制。",
	"While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish—for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.": "虽然索拉-凯尔的女儿们用卡特拉的声音和梅尼亚的拳头来实施他们的统治，但他们也用食物来购买忠诚。索拉-凯尔的女儿们承诺，任何为她们服务的人都会有住所和食物。她们兑现了自己的承诺，提供了看似无穷无尽的食物供应。主食是一种被称为Grist的碎肉，可以作为炖肉、馅饼或香肠食用。碎肉又硬又酸，但却能填饱肚子，而且 \"碎肉厂 \"似乎有吃不完的东西。很少有Droaam人知道或关心grist的来源，但游客可能会比较胆怯，因为grist是由巨魔的肉磨成的，加工后供人食用。索拉-凯尔的女儿们掌握着加工格里斯特的秘密，在霍尔韦尔的其他地方是不吃格里斯特的。巨魔肉本身具有高度毒性和致癌性，但女儿们设计了一种神奇的草药和香料混合物，与磨碎的肉混合，使其可以食用。",
	"Every major town has a \"grist mill\"—a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate—though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily—stew, sausage, meat broth—but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew—there's plenty more where it came from!": "每个主要城镇都有一个 \"磨坊\"--一个提供磨料的公共食堂。碾磨厂包括装满巨魔的马厩；有些是作为惩罚而饲养的，有些则是为此目的而饲养的。他们的肉被慢慢切掉，总是留下时间让生物安全地再生--尽管这个过程的痛苦仍然令人痛苦。磨坊里提供的研磨剂的形式每天都在变化--炖肉、香肠、肉汤--但物质仍然是一样的，大多数东方人发现它是酸的和不愉快的。炉渣的一个好处是它是免费的。因此，请享受一碗炖糁--它的来源还有很多！\"。",
	"For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.": "对于那些有碎片或牙齿的人来说，还有很多选择。肉类是德罗阿米什的主食，而且大多数人喜欢几乎生吃；事实上，许多较小的巨人喜欢活吃。有些食物对人类来说可能是彻头彻尾的危险；例如，巨魔喜欢咀嚼干燥的腐肉爬虫触角，这对大多数生物都有显著的麻痹作用。有些菜肴是用一种微小的活体渗出物提供的，Droaamites认为这有助于消化。无论你走到哪里，菜肴都反映了该地区的异国野兽。在海岸线上，蒸熟的chuul备受喜爱，而在内陆，辛辣的流离兽则很受欢迎。",
	"It's commonly said that Eberron is \"wide magic, not high magic.\" The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society—communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster—finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.": "人们常说，Eberron是 \"宽泛的魔法，而不是高超的魔法\"。五国的文明是基于低级奥术魔法的应用，这些魔法被用来解决社会的问题--通信、娱乐、战争。然而，在Droaam，索拉-凯尔的女儿们正在建立一种文明，其基础不是广义的魔法，而是广义的怪物--为其不同公民的超自然天赋寻找公民应用。美杜莎的目光是一种可怕的武器，但石化也可以用来保护重伤或生病的人，直到他们能够得到适当的照顾。使用石像鬼作为信使，使用女妖作为镇上的传话人，这些都是他们自然天赋的明显应用，而制造麦片则是巨魔再生的一种更奇特的应用。在Droaam创造冒险时，要考虑如何以意想不到的、有用的方式使用怪物的天赋来推动文明。当你有一把锤子的时候，每一个问题看起来都像一个钉子。但是当你的工具是冥王星或石像鬼时，会发生什么呢？这里有几个应用要牢记在心。",
	"The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted \"songbird\" can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.": "东方的人们知道鹰嘴兽是一种怪物，它的声音可以引诱无辜的人走向死亡。但一个有天赋的 \"歌鸟 \"可以产生更广泛的效果，而不仅仅是不可抗拒的诱惑。一个有天赋的女妖的歌声可以激发希望或绝望，灌输快乐或使听众的眼睛流泪。鹞子在每个工作班的开始时都会唱歌，吸引工人们去完成他们的任务。每个磨坊都有一只鸣禽，它神奇的声音可以在下班时抚慰疲惫的工人。由于鹞子能以超自然的音量进行投射，鸣禽也能呼唤时间，并充当镇上的传令兵，在整个社区传递重要消息。",
	"The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it's not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with troll's blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is \"suck it up,\" but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce {@i troll's blood}, it could revolutionize public health.": "德罗亚姆的chirugeons采用的方法比乔拉斯科家族的方法更可怕，但这些技术仍然有效。Broodworms是一种蛆虫，其分泌物既能帮助麻醉病人，又能清洁受感染的伤口；微小的胶状方块也被用作一种不寻常的麻醉剂。虽然它还没有被广泛使用，但女儿们一直在用巨魔之血进行实验，这是一种具有显著治疗特性的药膏，事实上可能正是它所宣称的那样。德罗亚姆是一片严酷的土地，大多数时候，当人们遭受痛苦时，答案是 \"忍气吞声\"，但女儿们已经承诺在未来的日子里创造一个更好的世界。如果他们设法完善并大规模生产（%0%），它可以彻底改变公共卫生。",
	"With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.": "由于拥有众多食人魔和巨人，德罗阿姆拥有大量的原始力量。许多在五国需要专门设备或负重兽的任务，只需由一个巨大而强大的人形生物完成。",
	"The population of Droaam is staggeringly diverse. In addition to the sentient creatures that are part of this culture, the region is home to a remarkable number of monstrosities and exotic beasts. In part, this is due to the ancient influence of the daelkyr and the more modern experiments of Mordain the Fleshweaver. There are a considerable number of manifest zones in the area, along with passages to Khyber. But most of all, this has been a frontier for thousands of years. The central region of Khorvaire has long been home to powerful civilizations, and over time, its people actively worked to eliminate dangerous threats. Some monsters were exterminated, while others were driven away—and Droaam is one of the places they were driven to. There may have been a time when trolls and manticores roamed freely across all of Khorvaire; now, Droaam is the land of monsters.": "德罗亚姆的人口种类多得令人吃惊。除了作为这种文化一部分的有生命的生物之外，这个地区还有大量的怪兽和奇异的野兽。部分原因是由于古老的达尔凯尔（daelkyr）的影响和织肉者莫尔丹（Mordain）更现代的实验。该地区有相当数量的显灵区，还有通往凯博尔的通道。但最重要的是，几千年来这里一直是一个边境地区。霍尔韦尔中部地区长期以来一直是强大文明的家园，随着时间的推移，其人民积极努力消除危险的威胁。一些怪物被消灭了，而另一些则被赶走了--德罗阿姆就是他们被赶走的地方之一。也许曾经有一段时间，巨魔和尾兽在整个Khorvaire自由游荡；现在，Droaam是怪物的土地。",
	"So Droaam is a place where you can meet three impossible things before breakfast—and one of them may be the one serving you breakfast. While there are enclaves—such as Cazhaak Draal and the Venomous Demesne—that are largely populated by a single species, most of the great cities of Droaam are diverse communities hosting all manner of monsters. It's important to recognize just how varied the inhabitants of Droaam can be. There are significant differences in basic biology, psychology, and intellect. Ogres, trolls, hill giants, and ettins possess great physical power but are not as intelligent as humans, and Droaam's other citizens know to express things in ways they can understand and not antagonize them unnecessarily. Gargoyles are elementals and don't eat or drink; if you want to make a kind gesture to a gargoyle, you don't offer it a drink, you present it with a riddle.": "因此，Droaam是一个你可以在早餐前遇到三种不可能的东西的地方--其中一个可能就是为你提供早餐的人。虽然有一些飞地--比如卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）和毒蛇神殿（Venomous Demesne）--主要由单一物种居住，但德拉姆的大多数大城市都是容纳各种怪物的多样化社区。重要的是要认识到德罗阿姆的居民是多么的多样化。在基本的生物学、心理学和智力方面有很大的差异。食人魔、巨魔、山丘巨人和埃廷斯拥有强大的身体力量，但却不像人类那样聪明，德罗阿姆的其他公民知道用他们能够理解的方式来表达，而不是不必要地与他们作对。夜行神龙是元素，不吃不喝；如果你想对夜行神龙做出善意的表示，你不会给它提供饮料，而是给它出个谜语。",
	"Here's an overview of the most common sentient creatures in Droaam and the roles they play in society.": "下面是Droaam中最常见的有生命的生物以及它们在社会中扮演的角色的概述。",
	"The changelings who leave their city of Lost often work directly for the Daughters. Most use their skills as part of Katra's Voice, serving as entertainers, mediators, and bards; others gather information as Teraza's Eyes. Unless they have reason not to, the changelings of Lost wear their true faces; however, they use their shapeshifting aesthetically, creating exotic or ever-changing patterns across their skin. Skindancing is a changeling art that blends physical motion with transformation, and it can be a remarkable experience.": "离开迷失之城的变异人常常直接为女儿们工作。大多数人把他们的技能作为卡特拉之声的一部分，充当艺人、调解员和吟游诗人；其他人则作为泰拉扎之眼收集信息。除非他们有理由不这样做，失落的变种人都戴着他们的真面目；然而，他们在审美上使用他们的变形术，在他们的皮肤上创造出奇异的或不断变化的图案。跳舞是一种变化人的艺术，它将身体的运动与变形结合起来，可以是一种非凡的体验。",
	"Since the rise of the Daughters, gargoyles have been deployed across Droaam; they are also favorite recruits of House Tharashk. Civilian gargoyles serve as messengers and couriers, while most warlords also have a unit of combatready gargoyles that serve as scouts and rapid response. As elementals, gargoyles don't eat, sleep, or drink, and they can remain motionless for months or years. While gargoyles have traditionally been depicted as cruel predators, the fact is that they love the {@i thrill} of hunting. They yearn for challenge, and love riddles and puzzles almost as much as hunting prey.": "自从女儿国崛起后，夜行神龙就被部署到了整个德拉姆；它们也是塔拉什克家族最喜欢的新兵。民间的夜行神龙充当信使和信使，而大多数军阀也有一支可以作战的夜行神龙部队，充当侦察兵和快速反应。作为元素，夜行神龙不吃、不睡、不喝，它们可以在几个月或几年内保持不动。虽然石像鬼在传统上被描绘成残酷的捕食者，但事实上它们喜欢狩猎的（%0%）。它们渴望挑战，对谜语和谜题的喜爱程度几乎不亚于猎杀猎物。",
	"The mountains of Droaam are home to ettins and hill giants, both of which are native to Khorvaire. Ettins are distantly related to orcs, while the hill giants of Khorvaire are a form of ogre; while they use the same stat block as the devolved hill giants of Xen'drik, they aren't actually related. In the Barrens of the past, giants would come down from the mountains and dominate groups of goblins and kobolds. In Droaam today, they have primarily been drawn into heavy labor, as well as providing raw power to the armies of Droaam. Giants are not especially bright; as long as they are fed well (which requires a lot of food!) and celebrated for their efforts, they are generally content to serve their purpose.": "德罗亚姆的山区是埃廷人和山地巨人的家园，这两种人都是霍尔韦尔的原住民。埃廷斯与兽人有远亲关系，而霍尔韦尔的山丘巨人则是食人魔的一种形式；虽然他们使用的属性块与Xen'drik的进化山丘巨人相同，但他们实际上并没有关系。在过去的荒原上，巨人会从山上下来，支配地精和哥布林的群体。在今天的Droaam，他们主要被吸引到重体力劳动中，以及为Droaam的军队提供原始力量。巨人并不特别聪明；只要他们吃得好（这需要大量的食物！），并为他们的努力而庆祝，他们一般都满足于服务他们的目的。",
	"Vralkek is also home to a small contingent of giants from Xen'drik that found a home in this land of monsters. Most serve the fire giant Gorodan Ashlord, or at least acknowledge him as their spokesman to the Daughters of Sora Kell.": "Vralkek也是来自Xen'drik的一小队巨人的家，他们在这片怪物的土地上找到了家。大多数人都为火巨人戈罗丹-阿什洛德服务，或者至少承认他是他们索拉-凯尔之女的代言人。",
	"The gnolls of Droaam are described in more detail later in this section, and playable racial traits are presented in chapter 6. Every major city has a garrison of gnoll soldiers, who protect the interests of the Daughters. These gnolls aren't part of Maenya's Fist, and generally serve as peacekeepers rather than being used in punitive actions. Some warlords hire additional gnolls to serve their own personal agendas. While almost all gnolls in Droaam serve as mercenaries with the Znir Pact, there are always those whose services aren't currently contracted. Idle gnolls often work as hunters, selling fresh game to the local markets; grist is sustaining, but there are many creatures who prefer other meat when they can get it.": "本节后面将详细描述德罗阿姆的地精，可玩的种族特征将在第6章介绍。每个主要城市都有一支由地精士兵组成的驻军，他们保护女儿们的利益。这些地精不属于缅因州的拳头，通常作为和平的维持者，而不是用于惩罚性的行动。一些军阀雇佣额外的地精来为他们自己的个人议程服务。虽然在德罗阿姆几乎所有的地精都在兹尼尔盟约中担任雇佣兵，但总有一些人的服务目前还没有签约。闲置的地精经常作为猎人工作，向当地市场出售新鲜的野味；草料可以维持生计，但有许多生物在能得到其他肉类时更喜欢。",
	"Both goblins and kobolds were once oppressed underclasses within the Barrens, dominated by almost every other species in the plains. Over time, they developed their own shared culture that's entirely different from the cultures of either species elsewhere in Khorvaire; when someone says \"goblin\" in Droaam, it's understood that they mean \"goblins or kobolds.\" Most goblins and kobolds feel a close kinship and look out for each other. They learned long ago to value cunning over strength; the heroes of their tales are quick and clever. They are patient and enduring, and tolerate endless suffering while waiting for an opportunity to present itself.": "地精和哥布林都曾经是荒原上受压迫的下层阶级，几乎被平原上的其他物种所支配。随着时间的推移，他们发展了自己的共同文化，与霍尔韦尔其他地方的任何一个物种的文化都完全不同；当有人在Droaam说 \"哥布林 \"时，人们会理解为他们是指 \"哥布林或哥布林\"。大多数地精和哥布林都有一种亲密的亲属关系，并相互照顾。他们很久以前就学会了重视狡猾而不是力量；他们故事中的英雄都是敏捷而聪明的。他们有耐心和耐力，在等待机会的同时容忍无尽的痛苦。",
	"Those goblins who serve the Daughters of Sora Kell lead far better lives than their ancestors in the Barrens, and they are among the most numerous inhabitants of the large cities—and the most devoted supporters of the Daughters of Sora Kell. Most are especially excited about Kethelrax the Cunning, the kobold warlord; they believe that this marks the beginning of a new age where goblins will be recognized and rewarded for their work. However, there are still goblins in the domains of some warlords—notably Turakbar's Fist—who live miserable, short lives. While most goblins are content to focus on their work, some seek to help their oppressed kin or take petty vengeance on ogres and giants for the vast suffering inflicted on their people.": "那些为索拉-凯尔之女服务的地精过着比他们在荒原的祖先好得多的生活，他们是大城市中最多的居民--也是索拉-凯尔之女最忠实的支持者。大多数人对 \"狡猾的凯特拉克斯\"（Kethelrax the Cunning）感到特别兴奋；他们认为这标志着一个新时代的开始，地精的工作将得到认可和奖励。然而，在一些军阀--特别是图拉克巴的拳头--的领地里，仍有地精过着悲惨、短暂的生活。虽然大多数地精满足于专注于他们的工作，但有些地精寻求帮助他们被压迫的亲属，或者对食人魔和巨人施加在他们人民身上的巨大痛苦进行小规模的报复。",
	"The harpies of the Byeshk Mountains claim to be the children of the Fury, and they take joy in flight and song. They are wild and passionate, embracing love and hate alike with reckless abandon. Those harpies who left the mountains to \"sing Katra's song\" have embraced her vision and are thrilled to be building a nation with their voices. They are generally more intelligent than the standard harpy in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} and have more control of their supernatural voices, being capable of inspiring a range of emotions. Harpies call the hour and summon workers; they also help with crowd control, serve as town criers, and entertain the people.": "拜什克山的哈比人自称是怒火的孩子，他们以飞行和歌唱为乐。他们狂野而富有激情，不顾一切地拥抱爱与恨。那些离开山区去 \"唱卡特拉的歌 \"的哈皮人已经接受了她的愿景，并为用他们的声音建立一个国家而感到兴奋。他们通常比标准的哈皮在（%0%）更聪明，对他们的超自然声音有更多的控制，能够激发一系列的情感。哈比人呼唤时间，召唤工人；他们还帮助控制人群，充当镇上的传声筒，并为人们提供娱乐。",
	"In representing a harpy character or interacting with one, highlight their passion. Harpies {@i love} what they do; if they don't, they won't do it. Singing isn't merely a magical tool; it's a joyful act, a communion with the Fury and a work of art woven together. Whether singing weary goblins to sleep in a grist mill or acting as a courier in Sharn, harpies embrace life with absolute zeal. But harpies hate just as strongly as they love—and there are harpies who hate the Daughters and the entire idea of Droaam.": "在表现一个哈比角色或与之互动时，要突出他们的激情。哈比人{@i love}他们所做的事；如果他们不这样做，他们就不会这样做。唱歌不仅仅是一种魔法工具；它是一种快乐的行为，是与怒火的交流，是一种艺术作品的交织。无论是在磨坊里唱着疲惫的地精入睡，还是在沙恩充当信使，哈皮人都以绝对的热情拥抱生活。但是哈比人的仇恨和他们的爱一样强烈--有的哈比人憎恨女儿们和整个Droaam的想法。",
	"The harpies who work with the Daughters of Sora Kell are more intelligent than their cousins, and have learned to use their remarkable voices—which they can amplify up to three times as loud as normal—for more than just luring enemies.": "与索拉-凯尔的女儿们一起工作的哈比人比他们的表亲更聪明，并且已经学会了使用他们非凡的声音--他们可以将声音放大到正常的三倍--不仅仅是引诱敌人。",
	"A typical harpy songbird has an Intelligence of 10 (+0), a Wisdom of 12 (+1), and a Charisma of 14 (+2), along with the skills Performance +6 and Persuasion +4.

	"Most humans living in Droaam are easterners—brigands or renegades evading the law, or merchants seeking opportunities. However, a few are natives, serving Droaam as part of the Venomous Demesne. While the demesne's nobles are tieflings, humans are a significant part of the population, and Demesne humans can be found serving as magewrights in other cities. The humans of the Venomous Demesne have little in common with the people of the East and feel no kinship to the Five Nations.": "大多数生活在德拉姆的人类都是东部人--强盗或逃避法律的叛徒，或寻求机会的商人。然而，也有少数人是本地人，作为毒液王国的一部分为Droaam服务。虽然恶魔国度的贵族是铁弗林，但人类也是人口的重要组成部分，恶魔国度的人类也可以在其他城市中担任魔法师。毒妖国的人类与东方的人们没有什么共同之处，对五国没有任何亲属关系。",
	"There are relatively few medusas in Droaam, but their intelligence and mystical power makes them a vital part of this growing nation. Medusa architects direct construction in the blended cities, laying the foundations of what this nation will become. Medusas who choose to serve as Voices of Katra are often called upon to resolve disputes and enforce justice, for who dares challenge the ruling of a medusa? Cazhaak Draal is also the seat of the most organized religious tradition in Droaam—the worship of the Dark Six—and most powerful priests of the Six are medusas. Compared to many denizens of the region, medusas tend to be calm and rational; however, they expect to be treated with respect and aren't above a few harsh lessons to make a point.": "在Droaam，美杜莎人相对较少，但他们的智慧和神秘力量使他们成为这个成长中的国家的重要组成部分。美杜莎建筑师指导混合城市的建设，为这个国家未来的发展打下基础。选择担任卡特拉之声的美杜莎人经常被要求解决争端和执行正义，因为谁敢挑战美杜莎的统治？卡扎克-德拉尔也是德罗阿姆最有组织的宗教传统的所在地--对黑暗六神的崇拜，而六神最强大的祭司都是美杜莎人。与该地区的许多居民相比，美杜莎人倾向于冷静和理性；然而，他们希望得到尊重，并不吝于用一些严厉的教训来表明自己的观点。",
	"The medusas of Droaam are capable of receiving visual impressions through their serpent mane, and can close their primary eyes to prevent any threat of petrification. Medusa magewrights can also master a ritual—the Medusa's Kiss—that undoes the effects of medusa petrification, allowing this power to be used in a number of useful ways (such as preserving the life of a creature about to die). Medusas can control the movements of their serpents, and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal have developed a simple sign language called Serpentine that uses the movements of the serpents to convey messages. Other species can learn to understand Serpentine as an exotic language, but there's no way to speak it without a mane of living serpents.": "德罗阿姆的美杜莎能够通过他们的蛇鬃接收视觉印象，并能闭上他们的主眼，以防止任何石化的威胁。美杜莎魔法师还能掌握一种仪式--美杜莎之吻--可以解除美杜莎石化的影响，使这种力量可以用在许多有用的地方（比如保存即将死亡的生物的生命）。美杜莎人可以控制他们的大蛇的运动，卡扎克-德拉尔的美杜莎人已经开发出一种简单的手语，叫做蛇语，利用大蛇的运动来传递信息。其他物种可以学习理解蛇语，作为一种外来语言，但如果没有活蛇的鬃毛，就没有办法说这种语言。",
	"The minotaur clans of Droaam are spread across the plains. They are fierce barbarians and warriors who dominated goblins, kobolds, orcs, and other creatures in the days of the Barrens, and to this day, it is these clans that often lead raids into Droaam. However, this fierce aggression has prevented the minotaurs from becoming a major power, due to the long, destructive feuds between the clans themselves.": "Droaam的牛头人氏族分布在整个平原上。他们是凶猛的野蛮人和战士，在荒原时代主宰着哥布林、哥布林、兽人和其他生物，时至今日，正是这些部族经常带头突袭德罗阿姆。然而，这种激烈的侵略性使牛头人无法成为一个主要的力量，因为各部族之间存在着长期的、破坏性的争斗。",

Each clan has their own private name for the Prince and their own beliefs about the conduct he expects of his followers. In most cases, the Horned Prince seems to be an analogue to the overlord Rak Tulkhesh, desiring only bloodshed. However, the Red Hooves worship He Who Walks Behind, who is much like the Mockery; they focus on the use of terror and in deceiving their enemies. The Blade Breakers worship One Horn, who rewards strength and courage—much like Dol Dorn. The Dawn Harvest was a clan whose version of the Prince—the Dawn Gorer—encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in Droaam. The Dawn Harvest was destroyed by Maenya's Fist after refusing to accept Rhesh Turakbar as the warlord of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across Droaam.": "牛头人相信他们是被选中的战士，通常被称为 \"角王子\"，他们在战斗中磨练自己的技能，以便死后能加入王子。每个部族都有自己对王子的私人称呼，以及他们对王子期望其追随者的行为的信念。在大多数情况下，\"角王子 \"似乎是霸主拉克-图尔克什的类似物，他只渴望流血。然而，\"红蹄 \"崇拜 \"走在后面的人\"，他很像 \"嘲笑者\"；他们专注于使用恐怖和欺骗敌人。刀锋战士崇拜 \"独角\"，他奖励力量和勇气--很像多尔多恩。黎明收割者是一个部族，他们的王子--黎明之神--鼓励追随者以荣誉而战，并保护弱者，这两个特征在德罗安很少见到。在拒绝接受雷什-图拉克巴成为他们地区的军阀后，黎明收获被梅尼亚之拳摧毁；该部族的少数成员幸存下来，现在散落在德罗阿姆各地。",

Skullcrushers are well trained and act with military discipline.": "一个典型的碎颅食人魔有12的灵活性（+1），10的智力（+0）和10的智慧（+0）。他们精通重甲和武术武器，并且通常穿着板甲。碎颅者训练有素，行动具有军事纪律性。",
	"The origins of the oni are a mystery. Some people believe oni are the offspring of hags and giants, and that some are children or grandchildren of the Daughters themselves. Other stories claim there's a kingdom of oni in Khyber, likely a demiplane, and that the oni of the surface world are criminals banished from this wondrous realm. While rare, their intelligence and power make them valuable to the Daughters of Sora Kell. The oni Tzaryen Rrac is a trusted warlord, while other oni serve as commanders in Maenya's Fist, inquisitors in Katra's Voice, or administrators throughout the realm.": "鬼兽的起源是个谜。有些人认为鬼怪是女巫和巨人的后代，有些是女儿们自己的孩子或孙子。其他故事声称在开伯尔有一个鬼怪王国，很可能是一个半位面，而地面世界的鬼怪是被放逐到这个奇妙境界的罪犯。虽然稀少，但他们的智慧和力量使他们对索拉-凯尔的女儿们很有价值。鬼兽Tzaryen Rrac是一个值得信赖的军阀，而其他的鬼兽则在Maenya的拳头中担任指挥官，在Katra的声音中担任审问者，或在整个王国中担任管理者。",
	"Oni are cunning and curious. Some serve the Daughters in exchange for treasure, others for arcane lore, while some are simply content with the power they hold as agents of the hags. You could tie their broader goals to their true origin—if the oni are exiles from a hidden kingdom, they might be building power to reclaim that kingdom. If they are the children of the Daughters, they could be competing with one another to impress their parent, and generally engaging in sibling rivalry.": "奥尼是狡猾而好奇的。有些人为女儿们服务以换取财宝，有些人则是为了神秘的传说，而有些人只是满足于他们作为女巫的代理人所拥有的权力。你可以把他们更广泛的目标与他们的真正起源联系起来--如果鬼魂是来自一个隐秘王国的流亡者，他们可能会建立权力来夺回那个王国。如果他们是女儿们的孩子，他们可能会为了讨好他们的父母而相互竞争，并且一般会进行兄弟姐妹之间的竞争。",
	"Over countless generations of life in the Barrens, the orcs of the region developed two distinct cultures. The larger of the two are the {@i Gaa'aram}—Children of Wrath. The Gaa'aram embraced the chaotic, raiding lifestyle of the Barrens. Where the goblins and kobolds were often forced into service by more powerful creatures, the Gaa'aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa'aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa'aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they're the reason for the name of the Orcbone fortress that guards the Gap of Graywall. Gaa'aram orcs can be found in all of the diverse cities, and they're usually passionate supporters both of Droaam and their local warlords.": "在荒原上生活了无数代之后，该地区的兽人发展出两种不同的文化。两种文化中较大的是愤怒的孩子（%0%）。Gaa'aram接受了荒原上混乱的、突袭的生活方式。地精和哥布林经常被更强大的生物强迫服役，而Gaa'aram则自愿团结在最强大的领导者周围，充当凶猛的战士。对于加阿兰的兽人来说，为谁而战并不那么重要，重要的是你要战斗，而且要打得好。因此，加阿兰兽人经常作为突袭者遇到；他们是守卫灰墙峡的兽骨堡垒名称的原因。Gaa'aram兽人可以在所有不同的城市中找到，他们通常是Droaam和他们当地军阀的热情支持者。",
	"In the days before Droaam, few people of the Five Nations had even heard of the smaller of the two cultures, the {@i Gaa'ran}—Children of Sacrifice. The Gaa'ran orcs are pacifists and farmers—one of the only cultures to farm in the open Barrens. They believe that violence stains the soul—that those whose souls are pure pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa'ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torture and death, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa'ran settlements to stand—with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa'ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa'ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.": "在Droaam之前的日子里，五国中很少有人听说过两种文化中较小的一种，即牺牲的孩子（%0%）。Gaa'ran兽人是和平主义者和农民，是唯一在空旷的荒原上耕作的文化之一。他们相信暴力会玷污灵魂--那些灵魂纯洁的人可以超越多鲁尔，但杀害他人会永远毁掉你的一块灵魂。Gaa'ran人即使面对酷刑和死亡也坚持自己的信仰，随着时间的推移，荒原上的部落允许Gaa'ran人的定居点存在，但他们的理解是，当地的袭击者会定期出现并拿走他们的产品。虽然这是一种严酷的生活，但在索拉-凯尔的女儿们的带领下，Gaa'ran人已经繁荣起来了。虽然麦芽是德罗阿姆的主要生计来源，但女儿们认识到农业的价值，加阿兰部落得到了资源，并被安排负责一些农业项目。",
	"The Gaa'aram and Gaa'ran are both local cultures with no direct ties to other orcs of Eberron. Gaa'aram orcs are among those monstrous mercenaries House Tharashk has recruited in Droaam. The Gaa'ran have a talent for primal magic that suggests they were once tied to the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches, but they are not Gatekeepers and don't fight aberrations; their interest lies solely in cultivation.": "Gaa'aram和Gaa'ran都是本地文化，与Eberron的其他兽人没有直接联系。Gaa'aram兽人是Tharashk家族在Droaam招募的那些畸形的雇佣兵之一。加阿兰人有一种原始魔法的天赋，这表明他们曾经与阴影地带的守门人有联系，但他们不是守门人，也不与反常者作战；他们的兴趣只在于修炼。",
	"There are a significant number of shifters among the humanoid population of Droaam. In the former Barrens, shifters were largely mixed together with the Gaa'aram orcs, much the same way that the goblins and kobolds of Droaam have formed a collective culture. These orcs call shifters {@i taarka'va}—wolf brothers. Pairings between shifter and orc can produce offspring, but the resulting half-orcs are almost always sterile.": "在Droaam的人形人口中，有相当数量的变身者。在以前的荒原上，变身者很大程度上与加阿兰兽人混在一起，就像德罗阿姆的哥布林和哥布林形成了一种集体文化一样。这些兽人称变身者为{@i taarka'va}-狼兄弟。变换者和兽人之间的配对可以产生后代，但产生的半兽人几乎总是不育。",
	"Another group of shifters are found in the Watching Woods. They call themselves {@i Ur'haakar}—First Panthers. These shifters shun civilization and take pride in their primal connection. Experts at stealth, they possess both Hunter rangers and Living Weapon monks. A few of the Ur'haakar have joined the Dark Pack and left the woods to serve the Daughters and Droaam, but most of the panthers prefer their isolation and consider the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack to be corrupted shifters.": "在守望森林中还发现了另一群变身者。他们自称为{@i Ur'haakar}--第一豹。这些变身者回避文明，以他们的原始联系为荣。他们擅长隐蔽，同时拥有猎人游侠和活体武器修士。少数Ur'haakar人加入了黑暗族群，并离开森林为女儿们和Droaam服务，但大多数黑豹喜欢与世隔绝，并认为黑暗族群的狼人是被腐蚀的变异者。",
	"The Venomous Demesne lies in the west of Droaam, hidden by powerful illusions. It was founded by tiefling refugees from the ancient Sarlonan kingdom of Ohr Kaluun, and its four ruling families possess great knowledge and vast arcane power. Tiefling wizards and warlocks can be found serving as Katra's Voice or Teraza's Eye. The people of the Venomous Demesne—including a significant human population—look down on both the inhabitants of Droaam and the Five Nations, but they value their alliance with the Daughters of Sora Kell and are willing to suffer some indignities for this cause.": "毒液王国位于德罗阿姆的西部，被强大的幻象所隐藏。它是由来自古老的萨洛南王国Ohr Kaluun的铁弗林难民建立的，它的四个统治家族拥有丰富的知识和巨大的奥术力量。铁弗林的巫师和术士可以被发现担任卡特拉之声或泰拉扎之眼。毒妖国的人民--包括大量的人类人口--看不起德罗阿姆和五国的居民，但他们重视与索拉-凯尔之女的联盟，并愿意为此而遭受一些侮辱。",
	"In the Barrens, trolls often established themselves as chibs. A clever troll would gather a band of Gaa'aram orcs and dominate (and occasionally eat) a pack of goblins and kobolds, ruling a tiny fiefdom with strength and fear. This arrangement still persists in places, especially around Turakbar's Fist. Elsewhere, trolls have been drawn into the greater society of Droaam, serving in the military or performing heavy labor; those trolls who refuse to cooperate are \"sent to work at the grist mills.\" Given this, most trolls aren't too disruptive to society. However, trolls expect to be treated with respect by smaller creatures—if you're killed after you insult a troll, it's considered an unusual form of suicide, not a fault on the part of the troll.": "在荒原上，巨魔经常建立自己的奇葩地位。一个聪明的巨魔会召集一帮加阿拉姆兽人，支配（偶尔也会吃掉）一群地精和哥布林，用力量和恐惧统治一个小小的领地。这种安排在一些地方仍然存在，特别是在图拉克巴的拳头周围。在其他地方，巨魔被拉进了德罗阿姆的大社会，在军队中服役或从事重体力劳动；那些拒绝合作的巨魔被 \"送去磨坊工作\"。鉴于此，大多数巨魔都不会对社会造成太大的破坏。然而，巨魔希望得到较小生物的尊重--如果你在侮辱巨魔后被杀死，这被认为是一种不寻常的自杀形式，而不是巨魔的错。",
	"Trolls are proud of their strength, and enjoy engaging in tests of strength, like tug of war or lifting, with other trolls or ogres. While they generally dismiss smaller creatures, a troll is impressed by anyone that performs remarkable feats of strength; they generally respond better to intimidation than to diplomacy.": "巨魔对自己的力量感到自豪，并喜欢与其他巨魔或食人魔进行力量测试，如拔河或举重。虽然他们通常不理会较小的生物，但巨魔对任何表现出非凡力量的人都印象深刻；他们通常对恐吓的反应比对外交的反应更好。",
	"Like the skullcrusher ogres, the war trolls of Maenya's Fist are a unique subspecies that may be the result of magebreeding. They are utterly devoted to Sora Maenya and to Droaam.": "和碎颅食人魔一样，迈尼亚之拳的战争巨魔也是一个独特的亚种，可能是魔法繁殖的结果。他们对索拉-缅因亚和德罗阿姆完全忠诚。",

	"In the wake of the Lycanthropic Purge, many lycanthropes fled to Droaam. Most congregated in the Watching Wood under the leadership of the werewolf Zaeurl. However, there are a few independent lycanthropes scattered across the region. At the end of the Purge, the power of the curse of lycanthropy was weakened, and most of these survivors couldn't spread the curse to others; they could only pass it to their offspring. Keen to avoid any chance of further persecution, many of these renegade lycanthropes spent their lives solely in animal form. Even today, most members of the Dark Pack are born in animal form and consider it their true form. The natural lycanthropes of Droaam have the ability to speak in beast form, as worgs do, though this gift isn't passed on to creatures they afflict with lycanthropy.": "在狼人大清洗之后，许多狼人逃到了Droaam。大多数人在狼人Zaeurl的领导下聚集在守望之林。然而，也有一些独立的狼人散布在这个地区。在大清洗结束时，狼人的诅咒力量被削弱了，这些幸存者中的大多数不能将诅咒传播给其他人，他们只能将诅咒传给他们的后代。为了避免任何进一步迫害的机会，这些叛逆的狼人中有许多人只以动物的形式度过一生。即使在今天，黑暗族群的大多数成员都是以动物形态出生的，并认为这是他们的真实形态。Droaam的自然狼人有能力以兽形说话，就像虫子一样，尽管这种天赋并没有传递给被他们折磨成狼人的生物。",
	"In time, Zaeurl forged an alliance between the renegade lycanthropes and the native worgs of the Watching Wood, and this bond—the Dark Pack—remains strong to this day. However, just as there are a small number of lycanthropes with no ties to the Pack, there are worg packs scattered across Droaam. Worgs would often ally with Barrens chibs, and gnolls of the Barrakas clan often form bonds to worg companions. In general, the people of Droaam are quite comfortable with the presence of large predators, and it's polite to say {@i ta kuur}—You speak?—to a beast you've never met before.": "随着时间的推移，Zaeurl在叛变的狼人和守望森林的本地虫人之间建立了一个联盟，这种纽带--黑暗族群--至今仍很强大。然而，就像有一小部分狼人与族群没有关系一样，也有分散在Droaam的虫族族群。虫人经常会与巴伦奇布结盟，而巴拉卡斯氏族的地精也经常与虫人同伴形成联系。一般来说，德拉姆人对大型食肉动物的存在相当适应，对从未见过的野兽说{@i ta kuur}--你会说话吗--是很礼貌的。",
	"In recent years, the potency of the lycanthropic curse has returned. Under the rules of fifth edition, all lycanthropes can spread the curse, but the Daughters and Zaeurl both wish to avoid spreading lycanthropy—at least for the moment. The Dark Pack follows strict instructions—{@i don't bite unless you intend to kill.} As with trolls, most town guards understand this rule; if your friend picks a fight with a werewolf, sorry, it has to kill them after biting them; that's just a matter of public safety. Sora Katra is studying the curse of lycanthropy and may develop ways to prevent accidental contagion... or instead, she might develop a program of carefully managed infection to create a new corps of lycanthrope soldiers.": "近年来，狼人的诅咒的效力已经恢复。根据第五版的规则，所有的狼人都可以传播诅咒，但女儿们和Zaeurl都希望避免传播狼人的诅咒--至少在目前。黑暗族群遵循严格的指示--{@i don't bite unless you intend to kill.}和巨魔一样，大多数城镇守卫都明白这个规则；如果你的朋友找狼人打架，对不起，它在咬了他们之后必须杀死他们；这只是一个公共安全的问题。索拉-卡特拉正在研究狼人的诅咒，并可能开发出防止意外传染的方法......或者相反，她可能会开发一个精心管理的感染计划，以创造一个新的狼人士兵团。",
	"These are the common species of Droaam, but there are many more that could appear. Mordain the Fleshweaver unleashes strange things into the world. Manifest zones can create monstrosities. And in general, the creatures of Droaam haven't been subject to the expansion of a great nation and their subsequent extermination, unlike other regions. There may be a colony of yetis in the mountains. A lamia may rule over an ancient Dhakaani ruin. There may not be a large community of manticores, but you could easily find one living in Graywall. The Daughters of Sora Kell find a place for every creature.": "这些是Droaam的常见物种，但还有很多可能出现。编肉者莫尔丹向世界释放了奇怪的东西。表现区可以创造出怪异的东西。而且总的来说，Droaam的生物还没有像其他地区那样，受到一个大国的扩张和随后的灭绝。山中可能有一个雪人的殖民地。一个拉米亚人可能统治着一个古老的达卡尼废墟。也许没有一个大型的尾兽社区，但你可以很容易地找到一个住在灰墙的尾兽。索拉之女凯尔为每一种生物都找到了一个地方。",
	"The destruction of Stubborn and the declaration of Droaam came as a terrible shock to the people of the Five Nations. This wasn't the work of an upstart prince or an ogre chieftain. Both Sora Katra and Sora Maenya were known from countless tales—mostly terrifying ones in which things don't end well for the heroes. To most people, the Daughters were legends, figures used to scare unruly children. The Daughters were the reason you were afraid of the darkness as a child; Sora Maenya could be lurking in the shadows, waiting to add your skull to her collection. Most people of the Five Nations know nothing of the daelkyr or of the Dreaming Dark, but they know the Daughters of Sora Kell. This is one reason the Five Nations have refused to acknowledge Droaam; at the end of the day, they can't believe that it is real, and they hope that maybe they'll wake up tomorrow and realize it was all just a bad dream.": "斯特伯恩的毁灭和德罗阿姆的声明对五国人民来说是一个可怕的冲击。这不是一个新起的王子或食人魔首领所为。索拉-卡特拉和索拉-梅尼亚都是在无数的故事中为人所知的--大多数是可怕的故事，其中的英雄都没有好结果。对大多数人来说，女儿们是传说，是用来吓唬不守规矩的孩子的人物。女儿们是你小时候害怕黑暗的原因；索拉-梅尼亚可能潜伏在阴影中，等待着将你的头骨加入她的收藏。五国的大多数人对戴尔基尔或梦幻黑暗一无所知，但他们知道索拉-凯尔的女儿们。这也是五国拒绝承认Droaam的原因之一；说到底，他们无法相信这是真的，他们希望也许明天醒来会发现这一切只是一场恶梦。",
	"In principle, the Daughters of Sora Kell are hags. Sora Katra is a green hag, cunning and charismatic. Sora Maenya is an annis hag, possessed of tremendous strength and hunger. And Sora Teraza is a dusk hag, who sees the tapestry of the future laid out before her. However, calling Sora Katra a green hag is like calling a legendary bard a \"human.\" It's a foundation—a basic archetype to begin with. But all of the Daughters possess powers far beyond what's normal for hags of their type. Their mother was Sora Kell, one of thirteen immortal night hags said to have been created by Eberron and Khyber at the dawn of time. Each had a different father; in some stories these were fiends, in others, giants. Regardless, they possess inherited power, which has only increased over centuries of schemes and adventures. While the Daughters are usually spoken of together, each is a legend in her own right; they each have their own goals and distinct personality, and each one can offer different hooks for story or adventure.": "原则上，索拉-凯尔的女儿们是女巫。索拉-卡特拉是一个绿色女巫，狡猾而富有魅力。索拉-梅尼亚（Sora Maenya）是一个安尼斯巫婆，拥有巨大的力量和饥饿感。而索拉-泰拉扎是一个黄昏女巫，她能看到摆在她面前的未来织锦。然而，称索拉-泰拉为绿袍人就像称一个传奇吟游诗人为 \"人类\"。这是一个基础--开始时的基本原型。但所有的女儿们都拥有远远超出她们这种类型的女巫的正常能力。她们的母亲是索拉-凯尔，十三位不朽的夜行者之一，据说是由艾伯伦和凯伯在时间之初创造的。每个人都有一个不同的父亲；在一些故事中，这些人是恶魔，在另一些故事中，是巨人。不管怎么说，她们拥有继承的力量，这种力量在几个世纪的阴谋和冒险中只增不减。虽然女儿们通常被放在一起谈论，但每个人都有自己的传奇；她们都有自己的目标和独特的个性，每个人都可以为故事或冒险提供不同的钩子。",
	"The stories of Sora Katra are many and varied, for she's a gifted shapeshifter who seems to love meddling in the lives of heroes. She's the old woman at the inn whose idle comment sows doubt in lovers' hearts. She's the tinker who gives the farmboy the magic sword that helps him become king—the same blade he uses to kill himself in the final act. It's only through a wink to the audience or a hint to the reader that Katra's true identity is revealed. In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring {@i tragedy.}": "索拉-卡特拉的故事多种多样，因为她是一个有天赋的变形金刚，似乎喜欢插手英雄们的生活。她是旅馆里的老妇人，她的闲言碎语在恋人的心中埋下了疑惑。她是一个工匠，给了农民男孩帮助他成为国王的魔剑--也就是他在最后一幕用来自杀的那把剑。只有通过向观众眨眼或向读者暗示，卡特拉的真实身份才被揭示出来。在某些方面，这个虚构的角色与旅行者的角色重叠，但旅行者的礼物带来了混乱，而索拉-卡特拉的礼物则不可避免地带来{@i tragedy.}",
	"However, Sora Katra isn't always the villain in tales. When she acts openly, she often poses a challenge that tests the hero's wits or resolve. In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge—which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them—and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It's this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.": "然而，索拉-卡特拉并不总是故事中的反派。当她公开行动时，她经常提出挑战，考验英雄的智慧或决心。在大多数这些故事中，冠军未能应对挑战--公平地说，这通常对他们不利--灾难随之而来。但在那些罕见的情况下，主人公仍然忠于他们的理想或战胜了巫婆，她总是坚持她的承诺。正是这种测试决心和惩罚失败的嗜好催生了一个流行的故事，即如果一个孩子做出承诺并食言，索拉-卡特拉就会在夜里来到这里，拿走他们的一根手指。",
	"Sora Katra is known as a schemer. In many stories she's found weaving curses on her loom—plotting misery and misfortunes to release into the world. In the tale {@i The Sleeping Prince}, she curses the Prince of Wroat three days after his birth. In the end of the story, the Woodcutter's Daughter kills the giant in the King's Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter's Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra's motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn't kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter's Daughter—did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there's no question that Katra's actions always bring misfortune to {@i someone}—especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.": "索拉-卡特拉是一个著名的阴谋家。在许多故事中，她被发现在她的织布机上编织诅咒，策划痛苦和不幸，以释放到世界上。在故事（%0%）中，她在沃罗特王子出生三天后就对他进行了诅咒。在故事的最后，樵夫的女儿在国王的森林里杀死了巨人，并把他的舌头交给了卡特拉，当诅咒被解除后，樵夫的女儿嫁给了王子。学者们长期以来一直在争论卡特拉在这个故事中的动机。是她无法杀死巨人，而在设置一个导致巨人垮台的计划？或者，实际上她的目标从一开始就是提升樵夫的女儿--她制造障碍是为了给她选择的英雄一个崛起的机会？虽然这是一个积极的转折，但毫无疑问，卡特拉的行为总是给{@i someone}带来不幸--特别是那些未能达到她的挑战的人。",
	"Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples' anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want—such as the ambitions of her warlords—and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal—just as the prince in {@i The Sleeping Prince} was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter's Daughter. It's possible Droaam is another of her tests—but who's being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?": "索拉-卡特拉是一位出色的演说家。在故事中，她通常用她的话语来播种怀疑或不和谐，但她同样有能力将人们结合在一起，编织荣耀的梦想。在Droaam，她是女儿们的代言人，她的演讲将十几个不同的物种吸引到一起，并使突袭者和强盗们相信他们是比他们想象的更伟大、更壮观的事物的一部分。在某种程度上，这是在利用人民的愤怒和对东方人的恐惧。但她也有一个诀窍，就是简单地知道人们想要什么--比如她的军阀们的野心--并利用这一点为她服务。在泰拉扎的指导下，她预见到了问题，并总能找到人替无法避免的事情背黑锅。从某种程度上说，这就是德罗阿姆的核心之谜。为什么一开始要建立一个国家？既然泰拉扎很可能知道这一努力会失败，为什么还要寻求被《王权条约》所承认？一种可能性是，整个国家只是她实现真正目标的垫脚石--就像{@i The Sleeping Prince}中的王子是最终提升樵夫之女的工具。德罗亚姆有可能是她的另一个测试--但谁在被测试，如果他们失败了会怎样？犯罪组织Daask呢？这只是Katra的一个转移，还是Daask在推进一个神秘的议程？",
	"In her natural form, the Mistress of the Mires is a green hag, with green skin and dark green hair. However, she loves illusion and rarely remains in her true form. If she has no reason to remain in a particular form, she often shifts in mid-speech. She delights in forms with a personal impact on the people she's dealing with—taking the face of a dead lover or a betrayed friend. She possesses abilities like a powerful bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.": "在她的自然形态下，米尔斯的女主人是一个绿色的巫婆，有着绿色的皮肤和深绿色的头发。然而，她喜欢幻觉，很少保持她的真实形态。如果她没有理由保持一个特定的形态，她经常在说话的过程中转变。她乐于采用对她所面对的人有个人影响的形式--采用死去的爱人或被背叛的朋友的脸。她拥有像强大的吟游诗人一样的能力，既能鼓舞人心，又能施展强大的魔法和幻术。",
	"Sora Katra loves challenging heroes, which makes it easy to tie her to a story. Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters—she's spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince—who Katra torments, seemingly without reason—or are they the Woodcutter's Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character's backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character's family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?": "索拉-卡特拉喜欢挑战英雄，这使她很容易与一个故事联系起来。也许Droaam本身就是为了测试玩家角色而创造的--她花了十年时间，建立了一个国家，迫使角色们做出艰难的决定。如果你想在卡特拉和某个角色之间建立联系，那么这个角色是典型的沉睡的王子--卡特拉似乎毫无理由地折磨他--还是樵夫的女儿，她可能受到挑战，但最后有机会出人头地？还可以考虑一下农夫成为国王的故事。卡特拉可能会无缘无故地给一个角色一件神器；他们可以明智地使用它，还是会让他们陷入绝望？虽然与Katra的联系可以在游戏中发展，但你可以在角色的背景故事中建立与Mires女主人的联系。也许Katra因为他们的父母所做的事情而诅咒了这个角色的家庭；这个角色是否可以做一些事情来解除诅咒？或者，当他们还是孩子的时候，角色无意中为伪装的卡特拉做了一件事，而她承诺会报答这一善举；角色将在什么时候以及如何报答这一恩情？",
	"Sora Maenya is often depicted as a monster, said to wander the Towering Wood. She is known for her strength and her endless appetite; it's commonly said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. Stories often depict her through her absence, as an unstoppable force that punishes arrogance or cruelty. The shepherd warns the foolish farmers not to settle in the forbidden meadow; later, he returns to find their bones picked clean and stacked near the hearth, but without their skulls. There's no need to say who it was or to show the battle. The tale notes the missing skulls, and everyone knows that Maenya keeps the skulls of her victims, binding their souls to the bone and using them as lanterns.": "索拉-马恩雅经常被描绘成一个怪物，据说她在高耸的森林里游荡。她以她的力量和无尽的食欲而闻名；通常说她可以徒手捏碎一个巨人，然后把整个东西吃掉，但仍然很饿。故事经常通过她的缺席来描绘她，作为一种不可阻挡的力量来惩罚傲慢或残忍的行为。牧羊人警告那些愚蠢的农民不要在禁忌的草地上定居；后来，他回来发现他们的骨头被挑干净，堆在壁炉附近，但没有头骨。没有必要说是谁，也没有必要展示战斗的过程。这个故事注意到了失踪的头骨，每个人都知道马恩雅保存着她的受害者的头骨，把他们的灵魂绑在骨头上并把它们当作灯笼。",
	"Maenya greatly enjoys games and challenges, and she may spare someone who shows spirit. While she doesn't lay out schemes as complex as does Sora Katra, there are many tales of Maenya wandering the woods in disguise and tricking travelers into unwise contests. Her endless appetite reflects a broad love of life; it's not simply that she's hungry, it's that she loves to eat. She fights for the sheer joy that comes in crushing an enemy, and in the folk song {@i Edar's Last Jig}, she dances until her partner dies of exhaustion. She seems to have a sense of humor, albeit a morbid one; she may spare someone who makes her laugh, or let someone live because it amuses her to do so. There are stories where a hero beats her in a seemingly impossible contest through cunning and courage; when defeated, she honors any promise she has made. However, a victor would be wise not to gloat; in the tales, this is a sure path to an unexpected end.": "玛妮雅非常喜欢游戏和挑战，她可能会放过那些表现出精神的人。虽然她不像索拉-卡特拉那样制定复杂的计划，但有许多关于玛妮雅乔装打扮在森林中游荡，欺骗旅行者参加不明智比赛的故事。她无穷无尽的食欲反映了她对生活的广泛热爱；这不仅仅是她饿了，而是她喜欢吃。她为粉碎敌人的纯粹的快乐而战斗，在民歌中（%0%），她跳舞直到她的伙伴精疲力竭而死。她似乎有一种幽默感，尽管是一种病态的幽默感；她可能会放过一个让她发笑的人，或者让一个人活着，因为这样做会让她感到高兴。在一些故事中，英雄通过狡猾和勇气在一场看似不可能的比赛中击败了她；当被击败时，她会履行自己的任何承诺。然而，胜利者最好不要幸灾乐祸；在故事中，这肯定会导致意外的结局。",
	"Sora Maenya is the general of Droaam's armies, the iron fist that crushes any rebellion. The core of her power is Maenya's Fist, an elite corps of war trolls and skullcrusher ogres. Everything about the Fist is shrouded in mystery. Some say Maenya bred and trained them in a buried Dhakaani fortress; others say that Maenya herself forged the imposing plate armor that they wear. Whatever the truth, the members of the Fist are fanatically devoted to Maenya. While Droaam has yet to assemble an army combining the full force of its warlords, thus far, Maenya has shown herself to be a brilliant and unorthodox strategist, one not to be underestimated.": "索拉-梅尼亚是德罗阿姆军队的将军，是粉碎任何叛乱的铁拳。她权力的核心是玛尼亚之拳，这是一支由战争巨魔和碎颅食人魔组成的精英队伍。关于拳头的一切都被笼罩在神秘的气氛中。有人说玛尼亚在一个被掩埋的达卡尼堡垒中培养和训练他们；还有人说玛尼亚亲自铸造了他们身上的气派的板甲。无论真相如何，拳头的成员都狂热地献身于玛尼亚。虽然德罗阿姆还没有组建一支结合了其军阀全部力量的军队，但到目前为止，玛茵雅已经显示出她是一个出色的、非正统的战略家，不容小觑。",
	"In her natural form, Sora Maenya is an annis hag—a towering, powerful figure. She can assume smaller forms, but rarely seeks to play psychological games with her shapeshifting as Katra does. She appears in many tales as a hungry woman—tall and thin, with ragged clothing and long black hair, seeking shelter and food. While her primary power is her martial might, she does have supernatural gifts; the most infamous is her soulbinding. And perhaps she also has other necromantic skills that haven't been revealed in the tales...": "在她的自然形态下，索拉-马恩雅是一个安尼斯女巫--一个高大、强大的形象。她可以变成较小的形态，但很少像卡特拉那样试图用她的变形术来玩心理游戏。在许多故事中，她都是以一个饥饿的女人的形象出现的--又高又瘦，衣衫褴褛，黑色长发，寻找住所和食物。虽然她的主要力量是她的武功，但她确实有超自然的天赋；最臭名昭著的是她的灵魂束缚。也许她还有其他的亡灵技能，但在故事中并没有被揭示出来......",
	"While she's known for her immense strength, Sora Maenya isn't just a brute; there are stories in which she actually trains a hero, either teaching them to fight or granting them unnatural strength. While it would be an unusual path, a monk or barbarian could attribute their class features to early training with Sora Maenya. The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain—asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she'll come to collect. Or perhaps it's the other way around; perhaps as a child, the character defeated Maenya at a game, and it's she who owes the character a favor.": "虽然她以巨大的力量而闻名，但索拉-梅尼亚并不只是一个蛮人；在一些故事中，她实际上是在训练一个英雄，要么教他们战斗，要么赋予他们非自然的力量。虽然这将是一条不寻常的道路，但僧侣或野蛮人可以把他们的等级特征归结为早期与索拉-马恩雅的训练。问题是当她教他们的时候，他们是否知道她的身份；她是森林里的Reaver，还是她以一种假想的形式教他们？如果一个角色来自Eldeen Reaches，他们是否会在童年时遇到Sora Maenya？也许他们离家出走，在他们离开的时候，玛恩雅吞噬了他们的村庄。或者他们做了一个不明智的交易--要求索拉-玛恩雅杀死一个童年时的对手，她做到了；现在这个角色欠她一笔债，有一天她会来讨债。也可能是相反的情况；也许在小时候，这个角色在一场比赛中打败了马恩雅，是她欠了这个角色一个人情。",
	"One thing that makes the Daughters interesting is that they aren't simply mundane tyrants or warlords. They're legends, and have matched wits with countless heroes. One way to reflect this is to provide them with powers that aren't easily represented or replicated by the standard rules of play. For example, when a character is negotiating with Sora Katra, the DM might ask the player, \"Tell me a time in your childhood when you broke a promise.\" Sora Katra might then bring that story up: \"I watched you through your window that night, warrior. I chose not to take your finger then, for I'd had my fill that evening. But why should I trust you today, when you broke your word to your childhood friend?\"": "使女儿们变得有趣的一点是，他们并不是简单的世俗暴君或军阀。他们是传奇人物，曾与无数的英雄们斗智斗勇。反映这一点的一个方法是为他们提供不容易被标准游戏规则所代表或复制的权力。例如，当一个角色与索拉-卡特拉谈判时，管理员可能会问玩家：\"告诉我在你的童年时代，你有一次违背了承诺。\" 然后索拉-卡特拉可能会提起这个故事。\"那晚我透过你的窗户看着你，勇士。我当时选择不接受你的手指，因为那天晚上我已经吃饱了。但今天我为什么要相信你，因为你对你的童年朋友食言了？\"",
	"There's no saving throw against this and no mechanical effect. It simply demonstrates that Katra has powers and influence that can't be measured or fully defined. Perhaps she's using some form of telepathy and the whole thing's a con. Or perhaps she was there that night. The point is that she's not just a powerful bard; no one knows exactly what she can do. Likewise with Teraza's visions, or the idea that Katra can weave curses on her loom—like eldritch machines, the limit on these abilities is whatever the story needs them to be.": "对这个没有救赎，也没有机械效应。这只是表明卡特拉拥有无法测量或完全定义的力量和影响。也许她使用了某种形式的心灵感应，整个事情是一个骗局。也可能她那晚就在那里。关键是，她不仅仅是一个强大的吟游诗人；没有人知道她到底能做什么。同样，泰拉扎的幻觉，或者卡特拉可以在她的织布机上编织诅咒的想法，这些能力的极限是故事需要的。",
	"In many ways, the Daughters feel like characters pulled out of faerie tales, and the DM could draw inspiration from elements of Thelanis from chapter 5 (such as curses). But the Daughters are natives of Eberron, not archfey from Thelanis. As such, the Daughters are extremely powerful and long-lived, but they're ultimately mortal; they should be very difficult to kill, but they can die. In addition, archfey largely cannot change, and continue to play out the same story indefinitely. The Daughters are part of Eberron, and as shown by Droaam itself, they may have their preferred themes, but they can create entirely new stories.": "在许多方面，女儿们感觉像是从精灵故事中抽出的角色，DM可以从第五章的Thelanis元素中获取灵感（比如诅咒）。但女儿们是Eberron的本地人，而不是Thelanis的大法官。因此，女儿们非常强大且长寿，但她们终究是凡人；她们应该很难被杀死，但她们会死。此外，大恶魔在很大程度上不能改变，并继续无限期地演绎着同一个故事。女儿们是Eberron的一部分，正如Droaam本身所示，她们可能有自己喜欢的主题，但她们可以创造全新的故事。",
	"Sora Teraza is the most enigmatic of the Daughters of Sora Kell. She's known to be blind, yet she's perfectly aware of her surroundings; it's not that she can see, she simply {@i knows} where everything is. In some tales, it's said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It's also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people—books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.": "索拉-特拉扎是索拉-凯尔的女儿中最神秘的一个。众所周知，她是个盲人，但她完全了解她的周围环境；这并不是说她能看见，她只是{@i knows}知道所有东西在哪里。在一些故事中，据说她知道每个人什么时候会死；在其他故事中，她自己选择每个人的死亡时间。还有人说，她有一个图书馆，里面保存着记录杰出人物生活的书籍--这些书籍包含了那些英雄的灵魂，当那个冠军接近死亡时，她就会出现收集灵魂。",
	"Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she's not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn't always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge—that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn't actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn't as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.": "索拉-泰拉扎是一个黄昏的巫婆。虽然她可以改变自己的形状，但她很少这样做；她穿着一件破旧的长袍，把她的脸藏在一个深深的头罩下面。她很少说话，除了发布隐晦的声明之外。当她不和她的姐妹们在一起时，她会把时间花在打理她在大峭壁上的图书馆，或者冥想中。泰拉扎无疑是这个时代最有天赋的神谕。这可能与德拉贡的预言有关，也可能是她以一种不同的方式感知未来。当然，泰拉扎从未被描述为必须寻求她的答案；似乎她只是知道它们。鉴于这种准确无误的知识，女儿们似乎不可能失败；她可以揭示他们敌人的计划和他们可能寻找的任何宝藏的位置。但是泰拉扎并不总是分享她的知识，不为她的姐妹们的最佳利益行事，甚至不为她自己的利益行事。为什么不呢？最简单的答案是她精神不正常；任何思想都可能被这种知识的负担所打破。一个更复杂的可能性是，她被自己的知识所困--她已经知道自己要做什么，实际上没有任何真正的自由意志。或者，她的知识并不像表面上那样绝对：她有可能知道任何事情，但有些事情只是躲避了她的视线。",
	"Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there's an Aundairian war criminal—a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for—hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart—leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information—via {@spell dream} or {@spell sending}—that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn't mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza's knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it's a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it.": "不管怎么说，Sora Teraza当然可以，有时也会警告她的姐妹们可能的威胁，如奸诈的军阀或接近的玩家角色，并指导他们走最好的道路以确保胜利。但她也可以保持沉默，或者只在别人认为有用的时候才提供信息。例如，她可以透露有一个Aundairian的战争罪犯--一个有巨大技能的巫师，Sora Katra肯定会有用武之地--藏匿在灰墙中。但她可能会在他到达一年后才提供这一信息，而且是在他计划离开的前一天--这使得卡特拉只有24小时的时间来动员特工，试图抓住这个巫师。这些特工将与玩家角色竞争，还是他们将成为玩家角色？泰拉扎也可能为一个角色提供一个神秘的信息--通过{@spell dream}或{@spell sending}--这可能非常有用，即使这可能会伤害她的姐妹们。这并不意味着她背叛了她的姐妹们；这只是她在必须做的时候做了她必须做的事。虽然Sora Teraza的知识可能是无限的，但在实践中，它是推动一个有趣故事的工具，而不是破坏它。",
	"Droaam is a wild frontier filled with monsters. It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common races of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can't tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It's an opportunity to make bargains you couldn't make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don't exist elsewhere.": "Droaam是一个充满了怪物的野生边境。它站在五国的法律之外。东方的普通种族在这里是局外人，不受待见。为什么明智的冒险家会去这个危险的地方？最简单的答案是，它提供了你在其他地方无法讲述的故事的机会，正是因为它超越了五国的法律。这是一个你可以与霍尔韦尔其他地方的生物互动的地方，一个探索这些生物在不只是吃冒险者或坐在成堆的金子上时能用他们的超自然天赋做什么的机会。这是一个机会，你可以在其他地方做不到的交易，也可以找到其他地方没有的冒险。",
	"The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation—even if Droaam isn't currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don't easily translate to low-level play—there's no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll—it's easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents new racial traits for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you're from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?": "索拉-凯尔的女儿们可以作为冒险者队伍的团体赞助人，如（%0%）所述。这支队伍可能是达斯克的代理人，而达斯克在德罗阿姆之外被认为是一个犯罪组织。但女儿们是国家元首，人物也可以是国家的合法特使--即使Droaam目前不被承认为合法国家。这对玩家来说是一个创建畸形角色团队的好机会。虽然有些生物不容易转化为低级游戏--没有简单的方法来制作一级战争巨魔--但玩兽人、移居者、变异者、哥布林、哥布林和牛头人很容易。此外，第6章介绍了创建地精角色的新种族特性。在创建一个怪物角色时，要考虑你是来自新的混合城市之一，还是来自旧的飞地；你的第一忠诚是对索拉-凯尔的女儿，还是对你的个人军阀？你是否渴望自己成为一个军阀？",
	"As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.": "作为Droaam的代理人，冒险者可以被派去执行女儿们的个人任务：也许是调查一个有可能导致起义的谜团，处理一个叛乱的军阀，或者从达卡尼废墟中恢复一件重要的文物。或者他们可以在更广阔的世界中充当特使，无论是与可能的盟友谈判，还是简单地充当亲善大使，向人们展示怪兽之国不需要被恐惧。",
	"There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam—perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon's blood and blood gin; it's also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon's blood, but to find out exactly who's creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.": "有许多不寻常的物品只能在德拉姆找到--也许一个工匠需要巴斯里斯克眼睛来完成他们最新的发明。德罗亚姆也是一些奇怪的炼金术混合物的唯一来源，比如龙血和血琴；也有可能五国的人物被派到德罗亚姆不是为了获得龙血，而是为了找出到底是谁在制造龙血以及如何制造。德罗亚姆也是一个可以与黑暗六神的强大牧师公开交流的地方；如果冒险者需要守护者的高级牧师的帮助，灰墙可能是最近和最快捷的选择。",
	"Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they're haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be legendary treasures hidden in the depths.": "德罗亚姆有大量的达卡尼遗迹，尚未被莫格莱夫探险家的贪婪之手所触及。在某些情况下，这些遗迹之所以没有被破坏，是因为它们被鬼魂缠身，被扭曲的畸形物侵扰，或者被野生怪兽或其他怪物占据，比如生活在卡扎克德拉尔的梅杜莎人。灰墙（Graywall）和大峭壁（Great Crag）都建在达卡尼（Dhakaani）废墟之上，无论冒险者是在寻找失落的达尔（Dar）神器还是可怕的达尔（Daelkyr）工具，深处都可能隐藏着传奇般的宝藏。",
	"The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa'vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region's goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?": "达尔凯尔-奥拉斯克（daelkyr Orlaask）曾在这个地区活动，在卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）和苏塔-德拉尔（Suthar Draal）下面有通往其半位面监狱的通道。腐蚀者迪尔恩（Dyrrn）也参与了这个地区的古代战争。根据一些说法，Dyrrn正是在这里释放了被称为 \"Kapaa'vola \"的传染性诅咒（在本章后面讨论），这也是为什么该地区的妖精与达尔古尔人和凯奇达卡安人如此不同的原因；能否在这里找到解除诅咒的关键？",
	"Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations—especially Aundair—might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel {@i The Queen of Stone} covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.": "布雷兰担心德罗阿姆正准备对其西部边境进行大规模攻击。其他国家--尤其是昂代尔--可能会鼓励这样的行动。索拉-凯尔的女儿们可以重复他们的要求，要求得到承认；《艾伯伦》小说（%0%）涵盖了这样一次峰会。同时，所有有龙纹的家族都对德罗安可能存在的商业机会感兴趣。这些利益集团中的任何一个都可以带着一队冒险者去德罗安，无论他们是作为间谍还是作为使节公开工作。",
	"Droaam—and Graywall in particular—is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It's a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it's a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It's the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.": "Droaam--尤其是灰墙--是持不同政见者、逃兵、强盗和战犯的共同目的地。这是一个成长中的城市，不受五国法律的约束。虽然它是一个怪物之城，但它有一个繁荣的外国区，是塔拉什克家族的主要飞地和越来越多的龙纹前哨的所在地。这是一个完美的藏身之所，一群冒险者可能被雇来从德拉姆（Droaam）找回某人，或者在事情上有更多个人利益。",
	"A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?": "一个在沙恩的计划失败的恶棍可以逃到灰墙；人物有多想报仇？或者，冒险者们可以了解到在更遥远的过去起作用的人的位置：最后一次战争中的老敌人，对战友的死亡或家乡的毁灭负责的人。他们是在寻找一个对无数平民死亡负责的昂代尔战争法师，还是一个试图刺杀博拉内尔国王的布雷利什贵族？另外，人物可能会发现一个老朋友躲在灰墙，但他们被一个强大的敌人盯上了；冒险者们能及时赶到他们身边帮忙吗？",
	"There have always been gnoll clans in the Barrens, though the Dhakaani goblins ruthlessly exterminated gnolls in imperial territories, driving them back into the wilds. But their story starts long before. In the dawn of time, Eberron was the domain of the fiendish overlords. This was an age of chaos, as the overlords constantly clashed with one another. {@creature Rak Tulkesh|ERLW}, the Rage of War, commanded armies of fiends, while the Wild Heart raised hordes of ravenous beasts. In the struggles between the two, the Wild Heart bred dire hyenas with the ability to consume the immortal essences of the Zakya warriors of Rak Tulkhesh. But the Wild Heart failed to anticipate how consuming fiends would affect its creations. Twisted from within by the immortal essence of the demons they'd devoured, the hyenas were warped into something entirely new, something that was neither beast nor demon: and so the first gnolls were born.": "荒原上一直有地精氏族，尽管达卡尼地精无情地消灭了帝国领土上的地精，把他们赶回了荒野。但他们的故事要从很久以前说起。在时间的黎明，艾伯伦是恶魔般的霸主的领地。这是一个混乱的时代，因为霸主们不断地相互冲突。(战争之怒（%0%）指挥着恶魔大军，而狂野之心则养育着成群的贪婪的野兽。在两者之间的斗争中，野性之心培育了可怕的鬣狗，有能力吞噬拉克图尔赫什的扎基亚战士的不朽精华。但野性之心没有预料到吞噬魔族会如何影响其创造物。鬣狗被它们吞噬的恶魔的不朽精华从内部扭曲，被扭曲成一种全新的东西，一种既不是野兽也不是恶魔的东西：于是，第一批地精诞生了。",
	"Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns. The fiendish spark burned within them, and when they weren't directly serving the Lords of Dust, most engaged in vicious acts of brutality. The Rage of War seeks endless battle, and when there is no greater conflict, it delights in setting its minions against one another. For countless generations, gnolls fought troll, ogre, and other gnolls seeking blood for their hungry idols.": "地精由战争和野性组成，被拉克-图尔克什和野性之心招募和培育。作为霸主的步兵，他们与兽人和其他早期人类作战，同时也与其他霸主的地精氏族作战。即使在霸主被打败并被银色火焰束缚之后，地精仍然是他们的棋子。邪恶的火花在他们体内燃烧，当他们不直接为尘土领主服务时，大多数人都从事着恶毒的暴行。战争之怒寻求无休止的战斗，当没有更大的冲突时，它乐于让它的奴仆们彼此对抗。无数代以来，地精与巨魔、食人魔和其他地精战斗，为他们饥饿的偶像寻求鲜血。",
	"Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin—then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as {@i Znir}—a word that simply means \"stone\"—and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one—not chib, god, or demon—to hold dominion over them.": "然后，几个世纪前，两个来自敌对部族的地精在浸透了他们亲属鲜血的战场上互相对峙，然后质疑导致他们的道路。这两个人劝说其他人拒绝那些要求无休止战争的声音，拒绝为恶魔服务而追逐死亡。两个人变成了四个人，然后是八个人，直到整个部族都听从了这个呼吁。族长们把他们的神像拖到现在被称为（%0%）的地方--这个词的意思是 \"石头\"--在那里，他们打碎了他们曾经服务的恶魔的形象。聚集在一起的猎人、巫师和战士们一起宣誓。他们可能是许多部族，但从今天起，他们将是一个族群。他们不允许任何人--无论是巫师、神还是恶魔--对他们进行统治。",
	"This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even just holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all of the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact.": "这说起来容易，做起来难。与内部的恶魔影响作斗争已经很有挑战性了，但荒原是一个混乱的战斗力量的织锦。新成立的兹尼尔盟约的领导人并不希望统治其他生物，但即使只是持有领土也会招致攻击。因此，他们制定了一条至今仍在前进的道路：雇佣兵之路。地精不会在兹尼尔周围的土地上要求任何领土。他们将为任何愿意支付公平价格的人而战。但如果有人试图奴役地精，或对兹尼尔本身发动攻击，他们将面临所有联合部族的愤怒。这是一个必须多次讲授的课程，但在一个多世纪后，这一点已经得到了验证。对那些付钱给他们的人来说，地精就像石头一样可靠。那些背叛他们或挑衅的人将在整个契约的威力面前倒下。",
	"Some scholars of the Five Nations find it strange that the Znir Pact never took the path of conquest. There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally—to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles—but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.": "一些研究五国的学者发现，兹尼尔盟约从未走上征服的道路，这很奇怪。在这个地区内，没有与盟约的联合力量相提并论的，他们本可以打败他们所服务的各种奇葩和军阀。但地精从来没有统治其他生物的愿望；他们喜欢狩猎和战斗的快感。契约之路允许他们做自然而然的事--跟踪和杀戮，进行无休止的战斗--但他们是一起做的。他们选择了他们所遵循的道路和他们所进行的战斗。人们可以看一下契约者，说他们为许多主人服务。但兹尼尔地精会回答说，他们只为自己服务：他们选择为谁而战，他们设定服务的条件。",
	"The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan's moon.": "兹尼尔地精包括十几个不同的部族，每个部族都拥有独特的传统。曾几何时，这些部族都献给了不同面孔的统治者，但当他们打碎了自己的雕像后，每个部族都选择了其中一个月亮。所有的地精都能熟练地打猎和战斗，但巴拉卡人被称为盟约中最优秀的追踪者；阿里特人是最致命的弓箭手；奥拉鲁恩人是最强壮的战士和最有力的先锋队。通常情况下，雇佣兵部队由单一部族的地精组成，根据未来任务的性质进行分配，合同通常是根据部族的月亮周期来协商期限的。",
	"The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls—though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.": "各部族在Znir地区保持着不同的领地，但任何部族的壁炉周围都欢迎所有的地精；Znir人努力粉碎部族之间出现的任何紧张关系。每个部族的巫师和领导人都在Znir的破碎神像周围维持一个议会。他们在这里调解争端，将合同分配给各部族，并分配资金和设备。艾尔部族磨练了他们作为铁匠和制革师的技能，他们制作了许多兹尼尔地精使用的设备--尽管兹尼尔人中仍有强烈的搜刮传统，而且战士们经常要求从倒下的敌人身上获得战利品。",
	"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Znir simply refuse to allow the demon within to hold dominion over them. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence—to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return.": "Znir人在粉碎他们的雕像时反抗了霸主，但每个地精的血液中仍有恶魔的火花。兹尼尔人只是拒绝让内心的恶魔主宰他们。年轻的地精学会了如何抵制这种影响--引导恶魔的力量，而不给它支配自己的权力。对大多数地精来说，这是一个纪律问题；兹尼尔地精以面对挑衅时保持冷静而著称，在学会与自己的恶魔斗争后，他们不容易被凡人所操纵。然而，有些地精学会利用他们的非自然遗产，并以有用的方式引导这种力量。兹尼尔地精有他们自己的游侠和野蛮人的对应物；游侠的原始魔法来自野性之心，而野蛮人则引导战争之怒的愤怒。兹尼尔萨满与术士类似，通常遵循恶魔之路。然而，在所有这些例子中，Znir人并不为黑暗力量服务。相反，他们可以被视为从黑暗力量中窃取力量；学会利用它而不给予任何回报。",
	"In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as {@i hwyri}—Gnoll for \"warden\"—and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats. There has been some tension between the Vult and the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack; the Vult shamans suspect that the Pack is vulnerable to the influence of the Wild Heart.": "为了不让恶魔的力量支配他们的人民，兹尼尔地精也发展了他们自己的技术来对抗超自然的威胁。被训练来面对恶魔和亡灵的冠军被称为{@i hwyri}--格诺尔人的 \"守护者\"--并拥有与其他国家的圣骑士类似的力量。然而，Hwyri并不崇拜任何神圣的力量。他们的能力来自于对恶魔的训练和理解；他们不是十字军，而是雇佣军的恶魔猎人。大多数hwyri来自Vult氏族，在一个回避银色火焰的土地上，这些地精可能是人们面对恶魔威胁的最佳希望。沃特族和黑暗族群的狼人之间一直存在着一些紧张关系；沃特族的巫师们怀疑，黑暗族群容易受到野心的影响。",
	"So as a gnoll, there is a spark of demonic influence within you. The Znir learn to control this at an early age. But how does it manifest in you? Do you suppress it completely, or do you channel it in some way—possibly reflected by your class abilities? Are you a hwyri who seeks to fight supernatural threats, or are you not concerned with such things?": "因此，作为一个地精，你体内有一个恶魔影响的火花。兹尼尔人在很小的时候就学会了控制它。但它是如何在你身上表现出来的呢？你是完全压制它，还是以某种方式引导它--可能反映在你的等级能力上？你是一个寻求与超自然威胁作斗争的巫师，还是对这种事情不关心？",
	"As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. With this in mind, the Eyre clan produces a weapon they call the {@i myrnaxe}, named for the smith who created it. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axeblade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Functionally, a myrnaxe is a battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either slashing damage (with the axe blade) or piercing damage (with the spear). It's common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk—thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes.": "作为怪物之乡的雇佣兵，兹尼尔地精准备面对各种各样的异国对手。考虑到这一点，Eyre氏族生产了一种他们称之为（%0%）的武器，以创造它的铁匠命名。myrnaxe有一个坚固的木柄，一端是弯曲的斧刃，另一端是长矛头。从功能上讲，米尔纳克斯是一把战斧，但它可以用来造成砍伤（用斧刃）或刺伤（用矛）。常见的情况是，每个头都由不同的金属制成，因此矛头可能是银的，而斧刃是由byeshk制成的--这样可以最大限度地发挥其对付多种敌人的多功能性。",
	"The Znir consider the myrnaxe a signature weapon of their pact and don't sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a myrnaxe is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.": "兹尼尔人认为myrnaxe是他们契约的标志性武器，不向外人出售。获得myrnaxe的唯一途径是被给予或从一个倒下的敌人那里得到它。",
	"Droaam is a small place, and the Znir serve any who will pay a fair price. This inevitably leads to conflict between Znir gnolls fighting for two opposing sides. In such situations, Znir fight one another with all their skill, but they strike to wound, not kill. A gnoll wounded by another gnoll immediately withdraws from battle, no matter how superficial the wound. While some clients take umbrage at this—\"You can still fight! Get back out there!\"—this is an absolute rule of all Znir contracts, and gnolls who defy this are punished by the united clans.": "德罗亚姆是一个小地方，兹尼尔人为任何愿意支付公平价格的人服务。这不可避免地导致了为两个对立面作战的兹尼尔地精之间的冲突。在这种情况下，兹尼尔人用他们所有的技巧互相厮杀，但他们的攻击是为了受伤，而不是杀人。被另一个地精打伤的地精会立即退出战斗，无论伤口有多浅薄。虽然有些客户对此表示不满--\"你还能战斗！回去吧！回到那里去！\"这是所有Znir合同的一个绝对规则，违抗这一点的地精会受到联合部族的惩罚。",
	"While Droaam has risen around them, the Znir Pact continues as it always has. They don't work for shelter and grist, and expect to be paid for their service. This is perfectly acceptable to the Daughters of Sora Kell, who have placed a full half of the Pact forces on extended retainer. Most large communities have a Znir garrison employed by the Daughters. These troops are present to protect the region from brigands or invaders, and to help maintain order. But they serve the Daughters, not the local chib; it's understood that if the chib or their warlord turns against the Daughters, the local Znir will act against them. The remainder of the Pact serves other masters, and many warlords of chibs employ Znir gnolls as bodyguards, enforcers, or hunters.": "当德罗阿姆在他们周围崛起的时候，兹尼尔盟约却一如既往地在继续。他们不为住所和草料工作，并期望为他们的服务获得报酬。这对于索拉-凯尔的女儿们来说是完全可以接受的，她们已经将整整一半的契约军置于长期的雇佣关系之下。大多数大型社区都有一支由女儿们雇用的兹尼尔驻军。这些部队的存在是为了保护该地区免受强盗或入侵者的侵害，并帮助维持秩序。但他们是为女儿会服务的，而不是为当地的奇布服务的；大家都知道，如果奇布或他们的军阀背叛女儿会，当地的兹尼尔人就会对他们采取行动。契约的其余部分为其他主人服务，许多奇布的军阀雇用兹尼尔地精作为保镖、执法者或猎人。",
	"The Znir take their contracts seriously. If the client breaks the terms of the agreement, the contract immediately ends; but as long as terms are met, Znir will face any danger and never betray a client. They have earned this reputation over the course of centuries, and this gives them a place much like the Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith in Khorvaire; everyone knows that the word of the Znir is as unbreakable as stone.": "Znir人认真对待他们的合同。如果客户违反了协议条款，合同立即终止；但只要条款得到满足，Znir会面对任何危险，从不背叛客户。他们在几个世纪的时间里赢得了这种声誉，这使他们的地位很像霍尔韦尔的迪尼斯家族的哨兵元帅；所有人都知道，兹尼尔人的话语像石头一样牢不可破。",
	"House Tharashk has begun brokering the services of Znir gnolls within the Five Nations, but the Pact leaders are cautious about this arrangement. Within Droaam, Znir customs are known and respected, and the Znir can unite against anyone who defies them. The Znir recognize that they don't hold such power over the rulers of the Five Nations, and are concerned about serving so far from their stones. In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world. This scouting role is a reasonable path for a gnoll player character; it's their job to travel the world beyond and learn its ways, and to make friends and allies.": "塔拉什克家族已经开始在五国境内为兹尼尔地精提供中介服务，但公约领导人对这种安排持谨慎态度。在德罗阿姆，兹尼尔人的习俗是众所周知的，并且受到尊重，兹尼尔人可以联合起来反对任何违抗他们的人。兹尼尔人认识到他们对五国的统治者并不拥有这样的权力，并对在离他们的石头这么远的地方服务感到担忧。除了那些通过塔拉什克家族或达斯克家族服务的人之外，一些兹尼尔人被派往东部研究五国，收集关于五国人民和习俗的知识，以便兹尼尔议会能够决定如何与更广泛的世界接触。对于一个地精玩家角色来说，这种侦察的角色是一个合理的途径；他们的工作是游历外面的世界，学习它的方式，并结交朋友和盟友。",
	"Here are some common characteristics of gnolls—some of them biological, others cultural—that can help make a Znir character come alive.": "这里有一些地精的共同特征--有些是生物性的，有些是文化性的--可以帮助使兹尼尔角色变得生动。",
	"A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on clan, this can be uniform in color, or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green, and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of the gnoll sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don't grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation.": "一个典型的地精身高超过7英尺，但他们驼背的姿势掩盖了这一点。雄性和雌性的外观相似，其他物种很难将它们区分开来。地精身体上有厚厚的皮毛；根据不同的部族，皮毛的颜色可以是统一的，也可以是由斑点或条纹组成的。它们的眼睛是黄色或绿色的，在反射光下闪闪发光。虽然这些都是常见的特征，但地精的恶魔血统有时也表现在其外表上。一个不寻常的地精可能有发光的红眼睛，有像火焰一样发光的条纹的皮毛，或者其他不寻常的特征。通常情况下，这些并不赋予特殊的能力，尽管你可以为这样的突变赋予一个等级能力或特技。",
	"Gnolls possess powerful jaws, as reflected by their bite attack. They can chew through and digest bone, and dislike letting food go to waste. When feral gnolls raid a village, they consume even the bones of their victims. Znir gnolls won't eat their fallen foes if they're in the company of creatures who are uncomfortable with such behavior. But they often eat a small piece of any creature they slay—even if it's just a finger—to form a bond with the victim. The Znir believe that those you kill wait for you in the realm of death, and honoring them ensures that they won't be hungry when you travel to that land.": "地精拥有强大的下颚，这从它们的咬合攻击中可以看出。它们可以咀嚼和消化骨头，并且不喜欢让食物浪费掉。当野蛮的地精袭击一个村庄时，它们甚至会吃掉受害者的骨头。如果他们与那些对这种行为感到不舒服的生物在一起，兹尼尔地精就不会吃他们倒下的敌人。但他们经常吃他们杀死的任何生物的一小块--即使只是一根手指，以形成与受害者的联系。兹尼尔人相信，你所杀的人在死亡之境中等待着你，而尊敬他们可以确保他们在你前往那片土地时不会感到饥饿。",
	"Gnolls have very strong pack instincts. They instinctively work together in combat, and think nothing of placing themselves in harm's way to protect their kin. Znir gnolls won't deceive members of their pack; if there are problems, they call them out directly. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters—but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don't show them the same respect.": "地精有非常强烈的群体本能。它们在战斗中本能地合作，并且不惜牺牲自己来保护自己的亲属。兹尼尔地精不会欺骗他们族群的成员；如果有问题，他们会直接叫出来。如果一个地精角色收养了一群冒险者作为他们的临时族群，这些事情也适用于其他角色--但如果他们的非地精族群伙伴没有对他们表示同样的尊重，地精会感到惊讶和愤怒。",
	"Gnolls often seem very aggressive to other creatures. However, gnolls themselves don't consider casual intimidation to be a hostile act; it's just a way to establish a place in the hierarchy of the pack, largely ignored once that hierarchy is established. This manifests in how gnolls make demands rather than requests, and use active statements rather than passive queries.": "地精对其他生物来说常常显得非常具有攻击性。然而，地精自己并不认为随意的恐吓是一种敌对行为；它只是一种在群体的等级制度中确立地位的方式，一旦这种等级制度确立，基本上就被忽略了。这表现在地精如何提出要求而不是请求，使用主动陈述而不是被动询问。",
	"Gnolls are strong and aggressive by nature. But both the Znir gnolls and their uncivilized kin are cunning hunters rather than simple brutes. Gnolls work together as a pack, always searching for weaknesses in enemies and supporting injured allies. Znir goals won't break their word, but they don't hold to any idea of honorable conduct on the battlefield; they are ruthless and efficient, and see nothing wrong with ambushing or tricking a superior foe. Some gnolls have a supernatural knack for mimicry (which could be represented by the use of {@spell minor illusion} or the {@feat Actor} feat) and use this gift to draw enemies into danger.": "地精的天性是强壮和好斗。但无论是Znir地精还是他们未开化的亲属，都是狡猾的猎人，而不是简单的畜生。地精作为一个群体一起工作，总是寻找敌人的弱点，支持受伤的盟友。兹尼尔人的目标是不会食言的，但他们在战场上并不坚持任何光荣的行为理念；他们无情而高效，认为埋伏或欺骗优势敌人没有错。一些地精有超自然的模仿技巧（可以用{@spell minor illusion}或{@feat Actor}的特技来表示），并利用这种天赋将敌人引入危险。",
	"Droaam is a diverse region, and the Znir gnolls have always been prepared to work for any master. They don't judge people by appearance or by their beliefs; just as they put up with demon-worshiping minotaurs in Droaam, a Znir hwyri can work alongside a templar of the Silver Flame or a warforged paladin of Dol Arrah. They may not like the people they are working with, and they may think that the beliefs of their companions are vile or foolish. But they place duty before such personal concerns, and won't insult allies or pick fights with them.": "Droaam是一个多元化的地区，Znir地精一直准备为任何主人工作。他们不以外表或信仰来判断人的好坏；就像他们在德拉姆容忍崇拜恶魔的牛头人一样，兹尼尔人可以与银色火焰的圣殿骑士或多尔-阿拉赫的战堡骑士一起工作。他们可能不喜欢和他们一起工作的人，他们可能认为他们的同伴的信仰是卑鄙或愚蠢的。但他们把责任放在这种个人关切之前，不会侮辱盟友或与他们争吵。",
	"The Gnoll language is unique, with a range of pitches that are difficult for humans to hear, let along duplicate. At first, it sounds much like the vocalizations of hyenas, with whining and chattering \"laughter.\" It's possible for non-gnolls to learn Gnoll, but it's a difficult feat. When stealth isn't necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it's common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond.": "地精的语言很独特，有一系列人类难以听到的音调，更不用说复制了。起初，它听起来很像鬣狗的发声，有呜咽和喋喋不休的 \"笑声\"。非格诺尔人有可能学会格诺尔语，但这是一项艰巨的任务。在不需要隐身的情况下，兹尼尔人在战斗中通常会很大声；他们通常用短促的格诺尔语来协调行动和确认位置。每个兹尼尔格诺尔人都有一个呼声，这是一种独特的呼声，它被用作一种口头签名；虽然这些呼声非常简短，但它们同时传达了个人身份和部族的忠诚。这些都是用来在战场上进行协调的，当一个地精进入一个友好的地方时，通常会发出呼声，作为一种简单的方式来识别自己，并给盟友一个回应的机会。",
	"Body language and posture—usually slumped—are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises up. The Znir dislike written communication, though they use it for contracts.": "肢体语言和姿势--通常是耷拉着的--是地精交流的一个重要部分；例如，当地精感到威胁或愤怒时，其脊柱下厚厚的毛峰会竖起来。Znir人不喜欢书面交流，尽管他们用它来签订合同。",
	"{@i Raat shi anaa:} the story continues. In the distant past, six mighty kings rose to power. Each sought to do their duty to their people: to bring them prosperity and security, to defeat all who would threaten them. Time and again, the six kings clashed on the field of battle, but the kings were matched in cunning and their warriors were equals in courage and skill. No victory could be won, and no compromise could be found. Jhazaal Dhakaan called the six kings together, and none could resist her summons. She brought them to a field soaked with blood and strewn with blunted blades.": "{@i Raat shi anaa:}故事继续。在遥远的过去，六位强大的国王崛起。每个人都试图为他们的人民履行职责：为他们带来繁荣和安全，击败所有威胁他们的人。一次又一次，六位国王在战场上发生冲突，但国王们的狡猾程度不相上下，他们的战士在勇气和技能方面也不相上下。没有胜利可言，也没有妥协可言。Jhazaal Dhakaan将六位国王召集在一起，没有人能够拒绝她的召唤。她把他们带到一个被鲜血浸透、散落着钝刀的场地。",
	"Jhazaal Dhakaan sang the song of the dar, reminding the kings that they were all one people. She sang the song of muut, of the duty all dar share. She sang the song of atcha, of the glory awaiting the people, of the heroes of the past and of those yet to come. With her words, she wove a dream, and she gave that dream to the six kings and to all who followed them. It was with this song that the Empire of Dhakaan was born, and it is this dream that guides us still.": "贾扎尔-达卡安唱起了达尔之歌，提醒国王们他们都是一个民族。她唱着muut的歌，唱着所有达尔人共同的责任。她唱的是Atcha之歌，唱的是等待人民的荣耀，唱的是过去和未来的英雄。她用她的话语编织了一个梦想，她把这个梦想给了六位国王和所有跟随他们的人。正是在这首歌的指引下，达卡安帝国诞生了，而且这个梦想至今仍在指导我们。",
	"Our empire was so grand that even the spirits grew jealous. The Lords of Madness crawled out of the shadows. They made monsters of our children and sought to break our people with terror. But no power could stand against the champions of Dhakaan. Our heroes blinded the Lord of Eyes and cut the roots of the Rotting Queen. They fought the great Corruptor and brought him down, but even as he fell, he whispered to the hero who defeated him. His foul words lingered, clinging to the champions, and they drowned out Jhazaal's song. As the whispers spread, those who heard them forgot the ways of muut and atcha. They forgot the glorious dream. They forgot what it meant to be dar. The duur'kala and the chot'uul came together, but there was no easy answer; only time would still the poisoned words. Our greatest leaders each took one of the treasures of our people and bore them down into the depths, into ancient fortresses that neither enemy nor poisoned word could penetrate. And there we remained, waiting for the echoes of that ancient curse to die, waiting to restore the dream of the people.": "我们的帝国是如此宏伟，甚至连神灵都嫉妒了。疯狂的领主从阴影中爬了出来。他们把我们的孩子变成了怪物，并试图用恐怖来摧毁我们的人民。但是，没有任何力量能够抵挡达卡安的冠军们。我们的英雄弄瞎了眼睛之王的眼睛，切断了腐烂女王的根基。他们与伟大的腐化者战斗，并将其击倒，但即使在他倒下时，他也对击败他的英雄低声说了话。他的污言秽语挥之不去，依附在冠军身上，它们淹没了贾扎勒的歌声。随着耳语的传播，那些听到耳语的人忘记了穆特和阿查的方式。他们忘记了光荣的梦想。他们忘记了成为达尔的意义。duur'kala和chot'uul走到了一起，但没有简单的答案；只有时间才能让这些有毒的话语停止。我们最伟大的领袖各自带着我们民族的一个宝藏，把它们带入深处，带入敌人和毒言都无法穿透的古老堡垒。我们留在那里，等待那古老诅咒的回声消失，等待恢复人民的梦想。",
	"Now that time is upon us. We have risen from our vaults and returned to a world that has been twisted by madness. Chaat'oor—defilers—have built foul cities on our foundations. The so-called \"goblins\" who remain have forgotten their glory and what it means to be dar. We must unite the Keepers of Dhakaan. We must reclaim our ancient treasures and crown the Emperor Yet to Come. And under their banner, we shall cleanse this land and restore our tarnished dream.": "现在，这个时代正在向我们走来。我们已经从地窖里站起来，回到了一个被疯狂扭曲的世界。Chaat'oor-诽谤者-在我们的地基上建造了肮脏的城市。留下来的所谓的 \"妖精 \"已经忘记了他们的荣耀和作为达尔的意义。我们必须团结达卡安的守护者。我们必须夺回我们古老的宝藏，为尚未到来的皇帝加冕。在他们的旗帜下，我们将净化这片土地，恢复我们被玷污的梦想。",

	"Little is known of the origins of the goblinoid species. Aereni records describe warring goblinoids on Khorvaire around forty thousand years ago, when the elves settled on Aerenal. But recent studies suggest that the goblinoids themselves appeared quite suddenly around this time. It's commonly believed that the goblinoids evolved in vast caverns below the surface, but some modern scholars hold competing theories. Kel Kador of the Library of Korranberg believes that the goblinoid subspecies were magebred from a common ancestor, and that this goblin progenitor might still be found underground. Hass Holan of Morgrave University has advanced a more exotic theory—that the goblinoids may have emerged from a demiplane within Khyber, from a warlike realm that has yet to be found. The goblins themselves have little interest in the origins of the {@i dar}—a Goblin word meaning \"the people.\" For them, the history of Dhakaan is the history of the dar. The two are considered synonymous, and regardless of their origins, the Dhakaani culture emerged approximately sixteen thousand years ago.": "对妖精物种的起源知之甚少。Aereni的记录描述了大约四万年前，当精灵们在Aerenal定居时，Khorvaire上的哥布林诺人发生了战争。但最近的研究表明，哥布林诺人本身就是在这个时候突然出现的。人们普遍认为，哥布林诺人是在地表下的巨大洞穴中进化而来的，但一些现代学者持有不同的理论。科兰伯格图书馆的凯尔-卡多认为，地精亚种是由一个共同的祖先磁力繁殖而来，而这个地精祖先可能仍然在地下被发现。莫格雷夫大学的哈斯-霍兰提出了一个更奇特的理论--地精可能是从开伯尔的一个半位面出现的，来自一个尚未被发现的好战领域。妖精们自己对{@i dar}的起源没有什么兴趣--妖精的意思是 \"人民\"。对他们来说，达卡安的历史就是达尔的历史。两者被认为是同义词，无论其起源如何，达卡尼文化出现在大约一万六千年前。",
	"The legend that opens this section deals with the roots of the Empire of Dhakaan, when six hobgoblin kings fought over ancient Khorvaire. Jhazaal Dhakaan was the greatest duur'kala bard of the age and the artifacts she crafted are testament to her remarkable power; the warhorn {@i Ghaal'duur} in chapter 7 is one of her creations. If the legend is to be believed, Jhazaal Dhakaan performed a feat of epic magic. She crafted the dream of an empire and bound the goblinoids of the time to this dream. This {@i Uul Dhakaan}—Dream of Dhakaan—gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first {@i marhu}—emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.": "本节开篇的传说涉及达卡安帝国的根源，当时六个妖精国王为古老的霍尔韦尔而战。Jhazaal Dhakaan是那个时代最伟大的duur'kala吟游诗人，她制作的神器证明了她的非凡能力；第七章中的战号（%0%）就是她的作品之一。如果传说是可信的，贾扎尔-达卡安完成了一项史诗般的魔法壮举。她精心打造了一个帝国的梦想，并将当时的妖精们捆绑在这个梦想上。这个{@i Uul Dhakaan}--达卡尼之梦--赋予了古老的妖精们统一的文化和目标，将他们团结在贾扎尔-达卡尼之下，成为达卡尼的第一位{@i marhu}--皇帝。达卡尼帝国遍布霍尔韦尔，将矮人推回开伯尔的深处，并将龙族赶到东部的丛林中。达卡尼人击退了泰尔纳达尔的殖民者，并将兽人、地精和其他次要文化人赶到了荒凉的边疆。",
	"The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the {@i duur'kala}—dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance—identified the threat but couldn't find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the {@i Kapaa'vola}—the Treacherous Whisper—had faded. These armies called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}, Keepers of the Empire—a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.": "达卡安的黄金时代持续了五千年之久，地精统治着后来被加利法尔要求的土地。正如传说中的那样，这个繁荣的时代随着Xoriat的入侵而结束，当时daelkyr带领反常者的军队进入Khorvaire。daelkyr摧毁了达卡尼的城市，并将哥布林诺人转化为畸形人，如dolgaunts和dolgrims。经过漫长而痛苦的斗争，达卡尼的冠军们扭转了局势。兽人守门人德鲁伊将达尔凯尔束缚在开伯尔，但正是达卡尼战士分散了他们的军队，猎杀了幸存的野兽。但正如传说中的那样，戴尔基尔即使在失败中也取得了胜利。腐蚀者Dyrrn创造了一种精神传染病，切断了地精与乌尔-达卡尼人的联系，并进一步鼓励了混乱的行为和非理性的信仰。{@i duur'kala}中的领导人--被视为智慧和指导的地精歌手--发现了这个威胁，但却找不到阻止它的方法；隔离是唯一的答案。达卡尼人决心保护自己的文化，他们把自己封闭在地下堡垒中，发誓只有在{@i Kapaa'vola}--诡谲的低语--消退后才会回来。这些军队称自己为{@i Kech Dhakaan}，帝国的守护者--这个词至今仍被用来涵盖所有达卡尼部族。",

As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor—artificers of Dhakaan—and the duur'kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth—that the foundations they'd built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel. It was in this time that the terms {@i goblin, bugbear,} and {@i hobgoblin} took root, even among the former dar themselves.": "从表面上看，帝国的残余部分四分五裂并崩溃了。就凯奇-达卡安人而言，达卡安帝国的历史在腐败者迪尔恩释放卡帕瓦人的那一刻就已经结束了。但事实上，在守护者们离开后，这个帝国还徘徊了几个世纪；更广泛的世界甚至不知道Kapaa'vola这个词，而历史书认为达卡安的衰落是一个漫长而丑陋的事件。迪尔恩的诅咒导致偏执狂和疯狂的信仰盛行，进一步使幸存者分裂。达卡安的纪律和知识消失了，达卡安的工匠--daashor和duur'kala的传统也被遗忘了。新的宗教和邪教出现了。一些部落拥护黑暗六神，而另一些部落则崇尚更广泛的万神殿。在达卡安的统治下，地精亚种被团结起来；在卡帕瓦人的统治下，强者统治弱者。一些部落发展了不寻常的复杂的传统，而另一些部落则是残酷和野蛮的。当人类探险家发现这些交战的部落生活在宏伟的城市废墟中时，许多人认为妖精族已经声称他们摧毁了人类文明的遗迹。这种错误的说法被用来为无数的暴行辩护。人类慢慢地取代了哥布林人，夺取了曾经属于达卡安的土地。妖精经常被征服，而虫族和霍布格林则被赶到荒野或开伯尔的上层。随着时间的推移，学者们了解了真相--他们所建立的基础是地精的城市，而不是人类的。但很少有人关心；在他们眼中，地精只是野蛮人，是黑暗六神的孩子，危险而残忍。正是在这个时候，{@i goblin, bugbear,}和{@i hobgoblin}这两个词开始扎根，甚至在以前的达尔人中也是如此。",
	"The oppression of goblins persisted for more than a thousand years, while bugbears and hobgoblins remained hostile forces in the fringes, dwelling in the wild lands ignored by humanity. When Galifar Wynarn began his conquest of the Five Nations, he promised freedom to any goblin who fought under his banner, Goblin soldiers played a vital role in the war that followed, and Galifar remained true to his word. Despite this freedom, goblins were still often treated with prejudice and suspicion, and denied education and other tools for success. Even today, goblins can be found in every major city of the Five Nations, but an overwhelming number live in poverty.": "对地精的压迫持续了一千多年，而虫族和霍布格林仍然是边缘的敌对势力，居住在被人类忽视的荒野之地。当加里法尔-维纳恩开始征服五国时，他承诺给任何在他旗帜下作战的地精以自由。地精士兵在随后的战争中发挥了至关重要的作用，而加里法尔仍然信守诺言。尽管有这样的自由，地精仍然经常受到偏见和怀疑的对待，并被剥夺了教育和其他成功的工具。即使在今天，在五国的每个主要城市都能找到地精，但绝大多数人都生活在贫困之中。",
	"In the shadow of Galifar, goblinoid cultures continued to develop and evolve. The most widespread were the Ghaal'dar tribes of the Seawall Mountains. While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal'dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued {@i muut} and {@i atcha}—their duty to their people and their personal honor—though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the {@i chaat'oor}–the non-native defilers—who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal'dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat'oor in the process.": "在加利法尔的阴影下，地精文化继续发展和进化。最广泛的是海堤山脉的Ghaal'dar部落。虽然他们仍然与乌尔-达卡安（Uul Dhakaan）断绝关系，对隐藏的守护者一无所知，但盖尔达尔人却恢复了他们古老历史的残片。妖精们追求{@i muut}和{@i atcha}--他们对人民的责任和个人的荣誉，尽管他们只知道这些是抽象的概念。他们对偷走他们古老土地的非本地破坏者（%2%）的愤怒得到了磨练。一些Ghaal'dar部落在最后一次战争中担任雇佣兵，在这个过程中对Chaat'oor有了更多了解。",
	"And then in 969 YK, chieftain Haruuc of the Rhukaan Taash led the uprising that claimed the lands of southern Cyre and founded the nation known as Darguun. Little did he know that other eyes were watching. Khesh'dar scouts and spies had been gathering information on the world above since the beginning of the Last War. The founding of Darguun made it even easier for the Silent Folk to move within the world. The duur'kala of the Kech Dhakaan concluded that the Kapaa'vola had faded; these Ghaal'dar might be victims of the daelkyr curse, but associating with them posed no threat to the Uul Dhakaan. And so, over the last two decades, the Keepers of Dhakaan have emerged from their vaults and returned to the world above.": "然后在公元969年，鲁卡安-塔什（Rhukaan Taash）的酋长哈鲁克（Haruuc）领导了起义，夺取了赛尔南部的土地，建立了被称为达尔古恩的国家。他不知道其他的眼睛在看着他。自最后一次战争开始以来，克什达尔的侦察兵和间谍一直在收集上面世界的信息。达尔古恩的建立使沉默民族在这个世界上的行动更加容易。Kech Dhakaan的duur'kala得出结论，Kapaa'vola已经消亡；这些Ghaal'dar可能是daelkyr诅咒的受害者，但与他们交往不会对Uul Dhakaan构成威胁。于是，在过去的20年里，达卡安的守护者们从他们的地窖里走出来，回到了上面的世界。",
	"{@i Ghaal'dar} is the Goblin word for \"mighty people.\" It has always been the Dhakaani term for the hobgoblins, just as the goblins are {@i golin'dar} (\"quick people\") and the bugbears are {@i guul'dar} (\"strong people\"). When used in lowercase—ghaal'dar—it refers to a hobgoblin of the Kech Dhakaan. However, when capitalized—Ghaal'dar—it's the name of the federation of hobgoblin-dominated tribes that dominate modern Darguun. The Ghaal'dar tribes are not Dhakaani; they mimic some of their customs and are proud of their imperial history, but they were twisted by the Kapaa'vola and differ from the dar in many important ways.": "{@i Ghaal'dar}是哥布林语的 \"强大的人\"。它一直是达卡尼人对妖精的称呼，就像妖精是{@i golin'dar}（\"敏捷的人\"），虫人是{@i guul'dar}（\"强壮的人\"）。当以小写字母ghaal'dar使用时，它指的是Kech Dhakaan的一个妖精。然而，当大写时--Ghaal'dar--它是主宰现代Darguun的、以妖精为主的部落联盟的名字。Ghaal'dar部落不是达卡尼人；他们模仿达卡尼人的一些习俗，并以他们的帝国历史为荣，但他们被卡帕瓦人扭曲了，在许多重要方面与达卡尼人不同。",
	"Likewise, {@i dar} means \"people.\" While common in the Goblin language, within this book, it's generally used to refer to the Dhakaani goblinoids who were unaffected by the Kapaa'vola. Today, the Ghaal'dar and other Darguuls have largely adopted the human words for their kind—goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear. Dar—the golin'dar, ghaal'dar, and guul'dar—are the original goblinoids who resisted daelkyr corruption.": "同样地，（%0%）的意思是 \"人\"。虽然在哥布林语言中很常见，但在本书中，它一般用来指未受卡帕瓦人影响的达卡尼哥布林人。如今，伽尔'达尔和其他达尔古尔人在很大程度上采用了人类对其种类的说法--哥布林、霍布林和虫人。达尔--戈林达尔、伽尔达尔和古尔达尔--是最初的妖精，他们抵制了达尔基尔的腐蚀。",
	"To unite the Six Kings, Jhazaal Dhakaan created a dream they could share—a vision that bound them all together. However, this isn't just a metaphor. When mortals sleep, their spirits touch Dal Quor and create temporary dreamscapes. Jhazaal Dhakaan bound the spirits of the dar together, creating a vast, permanent dreamscape within Dal Quor—a vision of the ideal empire. With the spirit of every dar tied to this place, when one of them sleeps, they dream of the empire and their place within it.": "为了团结六大国王，Jhazaal Dhakaan创造了一个他们可以共享的梦想--将他们所有人联系在一起的愿景。然而，这并不只是一个比喻。当凡人睡觉时，他们的精神会接触到Dal Quor并创造出暂时的梦境。Jhazaal Dhakaan将dar的精神捆绑在一起，在Dal Quor内创造了一个巨大的、永久的梦境--理想帝国的愿景。由于每个达尔的精神都与这个地方联系在一起，当他们中的一个人睡觉时，他们会梦到这个帝国和他们在其中的位置。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan isn't oppressive. Each dreaming dar has their own unique dreams within the Uul, and just like normal dreams, these are a place to process recent events and experiences. But the Uul Dhakaan provides a foundation that shapes and flavors those dreams, teaching and inspiring even while allowing the dar to process their own experiences. The Uul Dhakaan also retains the memories of all those who have gone before. While dreaming in the Uul Dhakaan, a warrior could experience a battle against the daelkyr that occurred thousands of years ago, fighting alongside one of the greatest heroes of that age. A smith could forge a blade alongside a legendary daashor. These things aren't real; both the hero and the smith are dreams, pieced together through memory. And as with any dream, the dreamer likely won't remember most of it after they wake up. But it remains in their subconscious as a source of inspiration and instinct. The dar {@i know} what the empire could and should be. They {@i know} the role they are supposed to play, the meaning of muut and atcha. And they {@i feel} the connection to the dar around them, understanding they all share that common vision. As discussed in the next section, this reinforces the other aspects of the Dhakaani psyche, strengthens their martial discipline, and underlies their adherence to caste roles.": "乌尔-达卡安并不压抑。每个做梦的达尔在乌尔有他们自己独特的梦，就像正常的梦一样，这些梦是处理最近事件和经验的地方。但是，Uul Dhakaan提供了一个塑造和调味这些梦想的基础，甚至在允许达尔处理他们自己的经验的同时，教导和启发。乌尔-达卡安还保留了所有前人的记忆。当在乌尔-达卡安做梦时，一个战士可以体验到几千年前发生的与达尔克尔的战斗，与那个时代最伟大的英雄之一并肩作战。一个铁匠可以和一个传奇的达索尔一起锻造一把刀。这些东西并不真实；英雄和铁匠都是梦，通过记忆拼凑起来的。就像任何梦一样，做梦的人在醒来后可能不会记得其中的大部分内容。但它仍然留在他们的潜意识中，成为灵感和本能的来源。达尔（%0%）帝国可以和应该是什么。他们（%1%）他们应该扮演的角色，muut和atcha的意义。而他们（%2%）与周围的达尔的联系，理解他们都有这个共同的愿景。正如下一节所讨论的，这加强了达卡尼人心理的其他方面，加强了他们的武术纪律，也是他们坚持种姓角色的基础。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan is a dream, and for most dar, it's nothing more than that. It's not something they discuss with outsiders, nor something they give much thought to from day to day; dreaming of the empire is just a part of life. But there are a few people within each kech who deal with the Uul Dhakaan in a more concrete fashion:": "乌尔-达卡安是一个梦想，对大多数达尔人来说，它不过如此。这不是他们与外人讨论的事情，也不是他们每天都会考虑的事情；对帝国的梦想只是生活的一部分。但在每个教会中，有几个人以更具体的方式处理Uul Dhakaan的问题。",
	"The \"dream watchers\" are an order of monks who monitor the Uul Dhakaan and protect it from corruption. In addition to specialized training and mental discipline, the chot'uul employ tools to retain their full consciousness and memories while dreaming, even allowing them to bring prized possessions into the dream. These {@i uul'kur} and {@i kra'uul} items are described in more detail in chapter 7. The chot'uul protect the Uul Dhakaan from quori manipulation, the corruption of the daelkyr, and other spiritual threats.": "看梦人 \"是一个僧侣组织，他们监督Uul Dhakaan并保护它不被腐蚀。除了专门的训练和精神纪律外，chot'uul还使用工具在做梦时保留他们的全部意识和记忆，甚至允许他们把珍贵的财产带入梦中。这些{@i uul'kur}和{@i kra'uul}的物品在第七章有更详细的描述。Chot'uul保护Uul Dhakaan免受Quori的操纵、daelkyr的腐蚀和其他精神威胁。",
	"A dirge singer's training often includes time within the Uul Dhakaan. An {@i uul'kur} allows the novice duur'kala to experience historical events within the dream or to study with the memory-shades of duur'kala masters.": "哀歌者的训练往往包括在乌尔-达卡安的时间。一个{@i uul'kur}允许新手duur'kala在梦中体验历史事件或与duur'kala大师的记忆阴影一起学习。",
	"The \"dream singers\" are dirge singers who specialize in walking in dreams. The deep vaults of the Kech Dhakaan are spread across Khorvaire, and the uul'kala act as their ambassadors and emissaries, maintaining communication between each kech and planning strategies. This serves a similar role to the {@item speaking stone|ERLW|speaking stones} of House Sivis, for a duur'kala equipped with an {@i uul'kur} can report back to superiors in their dreams. While useful, this practice isn't as widespread as the speaking stones of the Five Nations. {@i Uul'kur} are a limited resource, and even with one, it takes skill to navigate within the dream. There are kech vaults that lost their last uul'kala over the centuries in isolation, and as a result, that clan's fate remains unknown to the present day.": "梦想歌手 \"是专门在梦中行走的哀歌歌手。Kech Dhakaan的深库分布在Khorvaire，而uul'kala作为他们的大使和使者，在每个Kech之间保持沟通并计划战略。这与西维斯家族的{@item speaking stone|ERLW|speaking stones}有类似的作用，因为配备了{@i uul'kur}的杜尔卡拉可以在梦中向上级汇报。虽然很有用，但这种做法并不像五国的说话石那样普遍。{@i Uul'kur}是一种有限的资源，即使有一个，也需要技巧才能在梦中导航。有一些凯奇金库在几个世纪的隔离中失去了最后的uul'kala，因此，该部族的命运至今仍是未知数。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan serves as a foundation for the Dhakaani psyche, reinforcing their beliefs and traditions. But it's not an oppressive force, and for most Dhakaani, it's simply a source of instinct and inspiration. In creating a Dhakaani character, consider whether the Uul Dhakaan holds any special importance for you.": "乌尔-达卡安是达卡尼人心理的基础，强化了他们的信仰和传统。但它并不是一种压迫性的力量，对大多数达卡尼人来说，它只是一种本能和灵感的来源。在创造达卡尼人的角色时，要考虑乌尔-达卡安对你是否有特殊的重要性。",
	"The Uul Dhakaan is a stable region within Dal Quor. Dar are naturally drawn to it when they sleep, but it's possible for other creatures to stumble on it by accident, or even to seek it out. Chot'uul monks guard the dream, along with guardians formed by the dream itself, but this security isn't absolute.": "乌尔-达卡安是达尔-库尔的一个稳定区域。达尔人在睡觉时自然会被吸引到这里，但其他生物也有可能无意中发现它，甚至是寻找它。Chot'uul僧侣守护着这个梦境，还有由梦境本身形成的守护者，但这种安全并不是绝对的。",
	"There are many reasons adventurers might seek out the Uul Dhakaan. It holds the memories of the Dhakaani Empire, and could contain secrets about a weakness of daelkyr or locations of ancient relics. The King's Citadel might try to infiltrate the dream to learn more about the plans of the Kech Dhakaan. A Dhakaani character might need the help of other adventurers to repair some sort of disruption or corruption within the dream; are the chot'uul unable to see it, or have they themselves been corrupted? Again, while it is a repository of knowledge, the Uul Dhakaan is a dream, not designed for maximum efficiency or ease of use. Elements shift and change. You can revisit an ancient battlefield, but you'll have to find that battlefield, or find a way to call it up from the collective well of memories. The uul'kala and chot'uul are trained to find their way around the dreamempire, but such travel isn't always quick or easy.": "冒险家们有很多理由去寻找乌尔-达卡尼。它保存着达卡尼帝国的记忆，并可能包含关于达克尔的弱点或古代遗物位置的秘密。国王城堡可能会试图渗透到梦境中去，以了解更多关于凯奇-达卡尼的计划。达卡尼的角色可能需要其他冒险者的帮助来修复梦境中的某种破坏或腐败；是chot'uul无法看到，还是他们自己被腐蚀了？同样，虽然它是一个知识库，但Uul Dhakaan是一个梦，并不是为了最大限度地提高效率或方便使用而设计的。元素转移和变化。你可以重访一个古老的战场，但你必须找到那个战场，或者找到一种方法从集体记忆的井中调用它。uul'kala和chot'uul被训练成能在梦境中找到自己的路，但这种旅行并不总是快速或容易的。",
	"At the DM's discretion, a character that serves as an uul'kala or a chot'uul might possess rituals that allow them to draw allies into a dream, each maintaining full consciousness within the Uul. Otherwise, dream adventures will require tools like the {@i uul'kur} presented in chapter 6.": "根据DM的判断，作为uul'kala或chot'uul的角色可能拥有一些仪式，允许他们把盟友吸引到梦中，每个人都在Uul中保持完全的意识。否则，梦境冒险将需要像第六章中介绍的（%0%）那样的工具。",
	"So far, the quori have largely ignored the Uul Dhakaan. If anything, the stability of the dream-empire supports the overall goals of the Dreaming Dark, and the chot'uul are always watching for outside forces manipulating the dream. However, a campaign could explore a quori attempt to subvert the Uul, or consider the consequences of an alliance between the uul'kala and the Dreaming Dark. The Uul Dhakaan was formed in the current age of the Dreaming Dark; the Dhakaani know nothing of the quori belief in the Turning of the Age, and no one knows what will happen to the Uul Dhakaan when this occurs.": "到目前为止，曲里人在很大程度上忽略了乌尔-达卡安。如果有的话，梦想帝国的稳定支持了梦想黑暗的整体目标，而chot'uul一直在关注操纵梦想的外部力量。然而，一场战役可以探讨夸瑞试图颠覆乌尔，或者考虑乌尔卡拉和梦幻黑暗之间结盟的后果。Uul Dhakaan是在当前的梦幻黑暗时代形成的；Dhakaani对quori关于时代之交的信仰一无所知，也没有人知道当这一情况发生时，Uul Dhakaan会发生什么。",
	"When humans first came to Khorvaire, they knew nothing of the fallen goblin empire. What does the typical citizen of the Five Nations know today? Can a Brelish soldier tell the difference between a Ghaal'dar mercenary and a Dhakaani duur'kala? For that matter, what do the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins know about the Heirs of Dhakaan?": "当人类第一次来到Khorvaire时，他们对堕落的哥布林帝国一无所知。今天，五国的典型公民知道什么？布雷利什的士兵能分辨出Ghaal'dar雇佣兵和Dhakaani duur'kala之间的区别吗？就这一点而言，Ghaal'dar的妖精们对达卡尼的继承人了解多少？",
	"Anyone who has received the common education of the Five Nations knows that there was a goblin empire that fell before humans arrived on Khorvaire. Recalling the name \"Dhakaan\" requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. With a DC 15 check, a character also knows broad details—the territory controlled by the empire, the timeline of its rise and fall, the role of the subspecies, and its clashes with other cultures. A DC 20 check provides very detailed information: the importance of muut and atcha, the names of specific rulers, perhaps even the knowledge of the Kapaa'vola and the belief that some clans fled from this threat. Goblinoids of Darguun are more broadly familiar with their history, and would certainly know the name of the Empire of Dhakaan, know about the duur'kala and the Silent Clans, and understand the idea of muut and atcha, even if they don't experience these concepts in the same way as the dar. Darguuls must still make a history check to recall the names of specific heroes or events tied to the empire, but generally receive advantage on such checks.": "任何接受过五国共同教育的人都知道，在人类到达Khorvaire之前，有一个地精帝国已经灭亡。回顾 \"达卡安 \"这个名字需要成功进行DC10智力（历史）检查。通过DC15检查，一个角色也知道大致的细节--帝国控制的领土，它的兴衰时间表，亚种的作用，以及它与其他文化的冲突。DC20检定可以提供非常详细的信息：muut和atcha的重要性，特定统治者的名字，甚至可能知道Kapaa'vola以及一些部族逃离这一威胁的信念。达尔古尔的哥布林人更广泛地熟悉他们的历史，肯定会知道达卡安帝国的名字，知道duur'kala和沉默氏族，并理解muut和atcha的概念，即使他们没有像达尔人那样体验这些概念。达斡尔人仍然必须进行历史检查，以回忆起与帝国有关的特定英雄或事件的名字，但通常在这种检查中获得优势。",
	"So this is what people know about the fallen empire—but what about the Kech Dhakaan and its many clans? Do people know the origin and goals of the Keepers? This is more complicated, as the Kech Dhakaan have chosen to hide in plain sight. Before Darguun, goblinoid tribes and clans were scattered across the wilds of Khorvaire. When Haruuc established his nation, many unknown tribes stepped out of the shadows to take a place in his court. This was a perfect opportunity for the Kech Dhakaan and its Silent Clans. Two of these clans, the Kech Volaar and the Kech Shaarat have both revealed themselves to the Darguuls; but they have concealed their age, their power, and their resources. The Ghaal'dar know the Kech Volaar as an isolated clan of scholars with talented duur'kala. They know the Kech Shaarat as proud and deadly warriors. But the Ghaal'dar don't know that these clans have a direct tie to the ancient empire, that they possess powerful Dhakaani relics and daashor artificers, or that these clans are preparing to choose a new emperor of their own. Likewise, the Ghaal'dar don't know anything about the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand the fundamental differences between the modern goblins and the ancient dar. And because the Kech Dhakaan hide their true numbers and capabilities, the Ghaal'dar don't realize just how powerful these clans are; most of the Ghaal'dar tribes believe that the kech are small and somewhat backward, out of touch with modern life.": "因此，这就是人们所知道的关于堕落帝国的情况--但是凯奇-达卡安和它的许多部族呢？人们知道守护者的起源和目标吗？这就更复杂了，因为Kech Dhakaan人选择了隐藏在众目睽睽之下。在达尔古恩之前，地精部落和部族散布在霍尔韦尔的荒野中。当哈鲁克建立他的国家时，许多不知名的部落走出阴影，在他的宫廷中占据一席之地。这对凯奇-达卡安及其沉默的部族来说是一个完美的机会。这些部族中的两个，凯奇-沃拉尔和凯奇-沙拉特都向达尔古尔人透露了自己的身份；但他们隐瞒了自己的年龄、权力和资源。Ghaal'dar知道Kech Volaar是一个与世隔绝的学者部族，拥有天才的duur'kala。他们知道凯奇-沙拉特人是骄傲而致命的战士。但Ghaal'dar不知道这些部族与古代帝国有直接联系，不知道他们拥有强大的达卡尼遗物和达索尔工匠，也不知道这些部族正准备选择一个属于他们的新皇帝。同样，盖尔达尔人对乌尔-达卡尼人一无所知，他们也不了解现代地精和古代达尔人之间的根本区别。而且由于Kech Dhakaan隐藏了他们的真实数量和能力，Ghaal'dar并没有意识到这些部族有多强大；大多数Ghaal'dar部落认为Kech是小规模的，有些落后的，与现代生活脱节。",
	"If the Darguuls know little about the Kech Dhakaan, the people of the Five Nations know even less. When traveling abroad, the Heirs of Dhakaan generally take advantage of the broad ignorance of goblin culture, allowing people to assume that they're Darguul mercenaries. They won't hide their names or distinctive equipment, but it's a rare human who recognizes Dhakaani designs. Generally, the only way someone knows details about the Kech Dhakaan is if they've had personal experience with them.": "如果说达尔古尔人对凯奇-达卡安知之甚少，那么五国的人就更不了解了。在国外旅行时，达卡尼的继承人通常利用人们对地精文化的广泛无知，让人们以为他们是达古尔人的雇佣兵。他们不会隐藏自己的名字或独特的装备，但很少有人类能认出达卡尼的设计。一般来说，有人知道关于凯奇-达卡尼的细节的唯一途径是他们与他们有个人经历。",
	"To understand the Dhakaani, one must know the factors that shape them—biological, cultural, and supernatural. Some of these factors apply to all goblinoids, while others were weakened or destroyed by the Kapaa'vola, and apply solely to the Kech Dhakaan. As with any race or culture, these are generalized traits, and any individual dar could stray radically from this foundation. But it's a place to begin when creating a Dhakaani player character or NPC.": "要了解达卡尼人，就必须知道塑造他们的因素--生物的、文化的和超自然的。其中一些因素适用于所有的地精，而另一些则被卡帕瓦人削弱或摧毁，只适用于凯奇-达卡尼族。与任何种族或文化一样，这些都是概括性的特征，任何个别的达尔都可能完全偏离这一基础。但是，在创建达卡尼的玩家角色或NPC时，这是一个可以开始的地方。",
	"At a glance, the goblinoid subspecies are as different from one another as humans and halflings. The subspecies can't interbreed and have different lifespans. But a primal connection binds the dar together, with scent, body language, and other subtle factors uniting them; at an instinctual level, they feel more comfortable around goblinoids than they do with other humanoids.": "一眼望去，地精亚种之间的差异就像人类和半身人一样。这些亚种不能杂交，而且有不同的寿命。但一种原始的联系将达尔人联系在一起，气味、肢体语言和其他微妙的因素将他们联系在一起；在本能的层面上，他们觉得在地精族身边比在其他人形生物身边更舒服。",
	"Goblinoid civilization began in the caverns of Khyber, and the Kech Dhakaan have lived in subterranean vaults for countless generations. They are comfortable in close and barren environments, and may find vast open spaces to be disorienting.": "妖精文明起源于开伯尔的洞穴，凯奇-达卡安人在地下拱顶生活了无数个世代。他们在近距离和贫瘠的环境中很舒服，可能会发现广阔的开放空间让人迷失方向。",
	"Tied to their subterranean origins, the dar are used to living by the dim light of luminescent fungi or with no light at all. While absolute darkness impairs their darkvision, it's still possible to see and operate under those conditions, and many goblin tunnels have no light whatsoever. As a result, the dar have no inherent fear of darkness. They generally prefer to be active in times of dim light when their night-blind enemies are disadvantaged but the goblins can see freely, and Dhakaani communities come alive as night falls.": "与他们的地下出身有关，达尔人习惯于靠发光真菌的微弱光线或根本没有光线来生活。虽然绝对的黑暗损害了他们的黑暗视觉，但在这种条件下仍有可能看到和操作，而且许多地精隧道没有任何光线。因此，达尔人对黑暗没有固有的恐惧。他们一般喜欢在光线昏暗的时候活动，这时他们的夜盲症敌人处于劣势，但地精却可以自由地看东西，当夜幕降临时，达卡尼社区就会活跃起来。",
	"At a primal level, the dar seek structure and hierarchy. They prefer to work in groups and to have a clear plan of action, and tend toward lawful alignments. This doesn't mean that they feel any compulsion to follow the laws humans impose; rather, they are more inclined to work with others and to respect authority within their own communities. This basic instinct strengthens both the cultural drive of muut and the impact of the Uul Dhakaan.": "在原始的层面上，达尔人寻求结构和等级制度。他们喜欢在群体中工作，有一个明确的行动计划，并倾向于合法的结盟。这并不意味着他们感到有任何强迫性要遵守人类强加的法律；相反，他们更倾向于与他人合作，尊重自己社区内的权威。这种基本本能既加强了muut的文化动力，也加强了Uul Dhakaan的影响。",
	"The minds of dar are inherently pragmatic and rational. They have trouble engaging with entirely abstract concepts or things that cannot be proven. They prefer history to fiction; while the duur'kala inspire troops with stories, these are tales of things that actually happened. As a result, divine spellcasters are rare among the dar, as they struggle with the transcendental faith required to channel divine magic. While this could be considered a cultural trait, it's tied to the underlying psyche of the dar; they take well to structure and discipline, but struggle with pure faith. The Kapaa'vola weakened this trait within the wider goblinoid population, and there are priests of the Sovereigns and Six among the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins, but even there, priests, paladins, and divine magic are less common than among humans and their kin.": "达尔的思想本质上是务实的和理性的。他们很难接触到完全抽象的概念或无法证明的事物。他们更喜欢历史而不是小说；虽然杜尔卡拉用故事来激励军队，但这些故事都是实际发生的事情的故事。因此，神圣的施法者在达尔人中很少见，因为他们对引导神圣的魔法所需的超凡的信仰感到挣扎。虽然这可以被认为是一种文化特征，但它与达尔人的基本心理相联系；他们对结构和纪律很适应，但对纯粹的信仰却很挣扎。卡帕沃拉人在更广泛的地精人口中削弱了这一特征，在加尔达尔的地精中也有君主和六人组的祭司，但即使在那里，祭司、圣骑士和神圣魔法也不如在人类和他们的亲属中常见。",
	"The pointed ears of the dar are more flexible than human ears, and are an important part of the body language of the dar. Hobgoblins have especially expressive ears, and it's common for hobgoblin soldiers to use their ears to signal allies when silence is required, the same way a human soldier would use hand gestures. Two quick flicks of the ear is a common signal to allies to {@i be on guard}. Consider the ears of a dar in describing its mood.": "达尔人的尖耳朵比人类的耳朵更灵活，是达尔人身体语言的重要组成部分。霍布林的耳朵特别有表现力，霍布林士兵在需要安静的时候用耳朵向盟友发出信号是很常见的，就像人类士兵用手势一样。快速地扇动两下耳朵是向盟友发出的常见信号（%0%）。在描述达尔的情绪时，考虑到它的耳朵。",
	"Dhakaani society revolves around the concepts of {@i muut} and {@i atcha}. Muut is typically translated as \"duty,\" though it can also be seen as \"the honor of the empire\"—something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don't expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to \"thank you\" is {@i ta muut,} which simply means, \"You do your duty.\"": "达卡尼社会围绕着（%0%）和（%1%）的概念展开。Muut通常被翻译为 \"责任\"，尽管它也可以被看作是 \"帝国的荣誉\"--每个人都必须努力维护的东西。穆特是对你的期望，是你对你的战友们的回报。达卡尼人不会因为做了必须要做的事情而期望得到感谢；相反，他们对那些推卸责任的人感到厌恶。与 \"感谢 \"最接近的达卡尼语是{@i ta muut,}，意思很简单：\"你做你的职责\"。",
	"By contrast, atcha refers to \"personal honor\" or \"glory,\" an opportunity to exceed what is required of you. No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation {@i paatcha} means, \"This is a chance to gain honor!\"": "相比之下，atcha指的是 \"个人荣誉 \"或 \"荣耀\"，是一个超越对你的要求的机会。没有一个人满足于简单地做所期望的事情；对阿查的追求是一种强大的驱动力，它督促着飞镖去追逐他们的全部潜力。在战斗中，劝告（%0%）的意思是，\"这是一个获得荣誉的机会！\"",
	"The Ghaal'dar have adopted the concepts of muut and atcha, but merely as abstract concepts. For the dar, muut and atcha are the driving poles of daily life. Every dar {@i knows} muut; they know what is expected and what they owe to the empire. They feel a deep bond to their fellow dar, and know that in pursuing muut, they serve the common good. At the same time, they yearn to attain atcha—to exceed expectations, to do deeds that will be remembered by those who follow you. The deep role of muut and atcha is shaped both by childhood training, by daily life, and further by the Uul Dhakaan. So while Dhakaani have personal desires and ambitions, muut should always come first.": "Ghaal'dar采用了muut和atcha的概念，但只是作为抽象的概念。对于dar来说，muut和atcha是日常生活的驱动极。每个达尔（%0%）都是muut；他们知道什么是预期的，以及他们对帝国的亏欠。他们对自己的同伴感到深深的联系，并知道在追求muut的过程中，他们为共同利益服务。同时，他们渴望达到atcha--超越期望，做一些会被追随者记住的事。muut和atcha的深层作用是由童年训练和日常生活塑造的，并进一步由Uul Dhakaan塑造。因此，虽然达卡尼有个人的欲望和野心，但muut应该永远是第一位的。",
	"The Dhakaani idea of \"honor in victory\" is quite different from that of Dol Arrah and the people of the Five Nations. The Dhakaani prize victory and efficiency, both on and off the battlefield. Atcha comes from standing your ground against seemingly impossible odds and from displaying skill and discipline. There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire—but when possible, it's always better to kill for the empire. Muut demands that dar honor their debts and keep their promises; but ultimately, muut only binds dar to dar, and some feel no shame in lying to the chaat'oor who have stolen their lands and pillaged their tombs.": "达卡尼人对 \"胜利的荣誉 \"的想法与多尔-阿拉赫和五国人民的想法完全不同。达卡尼人重视胜利和效率，无论是在战场上还是在战场外。胜利来自于在看似不可能的情况下坚守阵地，来自于显示出的技巧和纪律。使用狡猾的手段来击败优势敌人是一种荣誉，因此，如果这是穆特的要求，游击战、伏击敌人，甚至暗杀都是可以接受的战术。达尔必须准备好为帝国而死，但在可能的情况下，为帝国而杀总是更好的。穆特要求达尔履行他们的债务，遵守他们的承诺；但最终，穆特只把达尔和达尔联系在一起，有些人觉得对偷走他们的土地和掠夺他们的坟墓的Chaat'oor撒谎并不羞耻。",
	"The culture of the Kech Dhakaan is relentlessly martial. The Keepers are armies who have been keeping the dream of the empire alive for thousands of years. There is no place for indolence or waste among the Dhakaani; surviving countless generations in the deep vaults required strict discipline. The young are assigned roles based on their subspecies and their aptitudes, and progress is based on performance. Now that the Dhakaani have returned to the surface, resources are more plentiful and life is less austere. However, thousands of years of strict tradition remain in place.": "Kech Dhakaan的文化是无情的武术。守护者是几千年来一直保持帝国梦想的军队。达卡尼人中没有懒惰或浪费的地方；在深藏的地窖中生存了无数代，需要严格的纪律。年轻人根据他们的亚种和他们的能力被分配角色，而进步则基于表现。现在，达卡尼人已经回到了地面，资源更加丰富，生活也不那么艰苦了。然而，数千年来的严格传统仍然存在。",
	"Within the Kech Dhakaan, all of the dar subspecies are celebrated for their strengths and what they have to offer the empire. This is reinforced both by the principle of muut and by the Uul Dhakaan. While different subspecies fill different roles in their community, it's important to note that among the Dhakaani, {@i all} roles are respected. Among the surface-dwelling Darguuls, goblins are often oppressed and dismissed, forced into menial tasks—by contrast, the Dhakaani are grateful for the service of the golin'dar, whether they are skilled crafters or menial workers. The goblin who cleans the latrines is serving the demands of muut as fully as a formidable hobgoblin warlord. The ghaal'dar lead because they are natural leaders. The guul'dar use their strength for the greater good. These things are simply {@i understood}, and the ghaal'dar don't have to use force to enforce their rule.": "在凯奇-达卡安（Kech Dhakaan）内部，所有的达尔亚种都因其优势和他们对帝国的贡献而受到赞誉。这一点在穆特原则和乌尔-达卡安中得到了加强。虽然不同的亚种在他们的社区中担任不同的角色，但重要的是要注意，在达卡尼人中，（%0%）角色受到尊重。在居住在地表的达尔古尔人中，妖精经常被压迫和解雇，被迫从事琐碎的工作--相比之下，达卡尼人对戈林达尔人的服务心存感激，无论他们是熟练的工匠还是琐碎的工人。打扫厕所的妖精是在为穆特的要求服务，就像一个强大的妖精军阀一样充分。ghaal'dar领导，因为他们是天生的领导者。guul'dar为了更大的利益而使用他们的力量。这些事情很简单（%1%），Ghaal'dar不需要使用武力来实施他们的统治。",
	"Stemming from this sense of unity, dar avoid killing other dar whenever they can. The Kech Dhakaan have different views on the future course of the empire, and each kech hopes to fill the throne. But they recognize that they are few against a world, and can't afford to carelessly spill the blood of other dar. This principle doesn't apply to the modern goblinoids of Darguun, the \"bugbears\" and \"hobgoblins.\" Physically, these creatures are dar, but they don't know the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand muut as the dar do. The leaders of the Kech Shaarat believe that while it may be possible to use the Darguuls, ultimately, they are not dar and must be treated as enemies. Some of the Kech Volaar are searching for a way to reconcile to these lost kin, expanding the Uul Dhakaan, undoing the damage of the Kapaa'vola and restoring its victims to the fold. Others among the Volaar argue that coexistence should be considered, that the isolationism of the empire must be reconsidered in the face of the widespread, powerful nations of the modern age. But compromise has never been a virtue of the Dhakaani, and what happens next will depend on the Emperor Yet to Come.": "源于这种团结的意识，只要有可能，达尔就会避免杀害其他达尔。Kech Dhakaan对帝国的未来发展方向有不同的看法，每个Kech都希望能坐上王位。但他们认识到，他们是少数人对一个世界，不能不小心地洒下其他达尔的血。这一原则并不适用于达尔古恩的现代妖精，即 \"虫族 \"和 \"霍布林\"。从身体上看，这些生物是达尔人，但他们不知道乌尔-达卡安，他们也不像达尔人那样理解穆特。Kech Shaarat的领导人认为，虽然有可能利用达尔古尔人，但最终，他们不是达尔人，必须作为敌人对待。一些凯奇-沃拉尔人正在寻找一种与这些失去的亲属和解的方法，扩大乌尔-达卡安，消除卡帕阿-沃拉的损害，并将其受害者恢复到该阵营。沃拉尔人中的其他人认为，应该考虑共存，面对现代广泛的强大国家，必须重新考虑帝国的孤立主义。但妥协从来都不是达卡尼人的美德，接下来会发生什么将取决于尚未到来的皇帝。",
	"While the principle of muut calls for individual sacrifice for the good of the empire, the dar generally have no great empathy for other species, and they are willing to take harsh action to secure the prosperity of their people. The Dhakaani don't subjugate other species—but not because of compassion. Rather, they consider it inefficient to try to force their values and traditions on creatures who have no concept of muut and who don't share the Uul Dhakaan. Thus, Dhakaani tradition has always been to drive enemies out of their territories, or if such exile is impossible, to kill them. They are fine with coexistence—as long as the enemy exists over there, and as long as the dar don't need more land.": "虽然Muut原则要求个人为帝国的利益做出牺牲，但达尔人通常对其他物种没有很大的同情心，他们愿意采取严厉的行动来确保他们的人民的繁荣。达卡尼人不征服其他物种--但不是因为同情心。相反，他们认为把自己的价值观和传统强加给那些没有Muut概念和不分享Uul Dhakaan的生物是没有效率的。因此，达卡尼人的传统一直是把敌人赶出他们的领土，如果这种放逐是不可能的，就把他们杀死。他们对共存没有意见--只要敌人在那边存在，只要达人不需要更多的土地。",
	"Family lines are of minimal importance among the Keepers. Rank must be earned, not inherited from a parent, and family names are only used within a clan. In a formal situation, the full clan name is used with no article (\"Dhaaka of Kech Volaar\"). Leaders often use the surname Dhakaan as a way of indicating that the empire itself is their family; thus, Tuura Dhakaan of Kech Volaar and Ruus Dhakaan of Kech Shaarat aren't actually related, it's a formal affectation.": "家系在守护者中的重要性微乎其微。等级必须靠自己争取，而不是从父母那里继承，而且姓氏只在一个部族内使用。在正式场合下，使用全宗族的名字，没有冠词（\"Kech Volaar的Dhaaka\"）。领导人经常使用Dhakaan这个姓氏，以表明帝国本身就是他们的家族；因此，Kech Volaar的Tuura Dhakaan和Kech Shaarat的Ruus Dhakaan实际上并没有关系，这是一种正式的影响。",
	"Depending on their purpose in the wider world, it's common for dar to use a \"traveling name\" among {@i gath'dar}—a general term for non-Dhakaani, without the pejorative tone of chaat'oor. The Kech Volaar and Kech Shaarat have both revealed their presence (though while posing as Darguul clans) and their names are used freely; other clans may or may not choose to operate openly.": "根据他们在更广泛的世界中的目的，达尔在{@i gath'dar}中使用 \"旅行的名字 \"是很常见的--对非达卡尼人的一般称呼，没有Chaat'oor的贬义语气。Kech Volaar和Kech Shaarat都透露了他们的存在（虽然是在冒充达尔古尔部族的时候），他们的名字被自由使用；其他部族可能选择公开活动，也可能不选择。",
	"The dar are soldiers. Most wear common uniforms, which have diverged slightly across clans, but the core designs are similar. Dhakaani uniforms and armor are durable and functional, designed to be worn comfortably for extended periods. Officers often sport hornlike protrusions on their helmets or shoulder plates that indicate rank. Many dar also wear an armored mask that covers the lower face; for lower-ranking soldiers, the design of the mask is usually tied to the clan, while for officers, it may evoke an honored ancestor or an imposing beast.": "达尔人是士兵。大多数人穿着普通的制服，这些制服在不同的部族中略有不同，但核心设计是相似的。达卡尼人的制服和盔甲经久耐用，功能齐全，可以长时间舒适地穿着。军官们的头盔或肩板上常常有角状突起，以显示军衔。许多达卡尼人还戴着覆盖下脸的装甲面具；对于低级别的士兵来说，面具的设计通常与部族有关，而对于军官来说，它可能会让人联想到一位尊贵的祖先或一只威武的野兽。",
	"Many dar make use of tattoos or scarification. Kech symbols are a common marking, but some—notably the Kech Volaar—take this further, with an ongoing series of tattoos that reflect the bearer's life and accomplishments.": "许多达尔人利用纹身或伤疤。凯奇符号是一种常见的标记，但有些人--特别是凯奇-沃拉尔人--更进一步，用一系列持续的纹身来反映持有者的生活和成就。",
	"Dhakaani art, like the rest of their culture, is practical and functional. Dar aren't fond of abstraction, and their art is primarily instructional (depicting an ideal to strive toward) or commemorative (preserving the deeds of heroes). Dar art can be realistic—faithfully representing historical figures—or symbolic—depicting Dhaakani ideals in simple and iconic ways.": "达卡尼人的艺术，就像他们文化的其他部分一样，是实用和功能性的。达卡尼人不喜欢抽象的东西，他们的艺术主要是指导性的（描绘了一个需要努力实现的理想）或纪念性的（保存了英雄的事迹）。达尔人的艺术可以是现实的--忠实地表现历史人物，也可以是象征性的--以简单和标志性的方式描述达卡尼的理想。",
	"Dar clothing and art is generally designed to be viewed in dark subterranean tunnels, where darkvision conveys color in shades of gray. As a result, color combinations can seem quite odd to human eyes, but this is because they aren't chosen for their color, but for how they appear in the dark.": "达尔人的服装和艺术一般都是为了在黑暗的地下隧道中观看，在那里，黑暗视觉以灰色的深浅来传达颜色。因此，在人类眼中，颜色组合可能看起来很奇怪，但这是因为它们不是因为颜色而被选择，而是因为它们在黑暗中的表现。",
	"The Kech Dhakaan began as armies, and further had limited resources in the deep vaults; as a result, their food focuses on practical nutrition, and waste is unacceptable. Dhakaani cuisine is simple, hearty, and very portable once prepared. Food tends to be thick and chewy, with sour and bitter flavors central to the dar palate, and strong spices sometimes used to mask undesirable tastes. On the surface, a grain known as {@i noon} is a primary source of sustenance. In the subterranean vaults, a fungus called {@i suur} fills this role. Surface-dwelling dar enjoy lizards and snakes—sources of both eggs and meat—while in the depths, blind cave fish and insects are common sources of protein.": "凯奇-达卡尼人开始时是军队，进一步在深宫中拥有有限的资源；因此，他们的食物注重实用营养，浪费是不可接受的。达卡尼人的菜肴简单、丰盛，而且一旦准备好就非常容易携带。食物往往是厚实耐嚼的，酸味和苦味是达卡尼人口味的核心，强烈的香料有时被用来掩盖不受欢迎的味道。在地表，一种被称为（%0%）的谷物是主要的养料来源。在地下拱顶，一种被称为{@i suur}的真菌充当了这个角色。地表居住的达尔喜欢蜥蜴和蛇--蛋和肉的来源，而在深处，盲洞鱼和昆虫是常见的蛋白质来源。",
	"Suur and noon are usually eaten in the form of starchy balls. Other Dhakaani meals are typically boiled or steamed in flavored liquids, such as eggs boiled in broth. In addition to being used for seasoning, pickling is a crucial form of preservation. Dehydrated meats, especially chewy lizard and fish jerky, are also common staples.": "苏尔和午时通常以淀粉球的形式食用。其他达卡尼餐通常是在调味液体中煮或蒸，如用肉汤煮鸡蛋。除了用于调味外，腌制也是一种重要的保存方式。脱水肉，特别是有嚼劲的蜥蜴和鱼干，也是常见的主食。",
	"While sweet foods are rare within the kech, the golin'dar have a noted sweet tooth. Traveling goblins often indulge in sweets and desserts while traveling with gath'dar. However, dar are often lactose intolerant, and as a result, might avoid many gath'dar foods.": "虽然甜食在凯奇内部很少见，但戈林达尔人却很喜欢甜食。旅行中的地精经常在与gath'dar一起旅行时沉溺于甜食和甜点中。然而，达尔通常对乳糖不耐受，因此，可能会避免许多加斯达尔的食物。",
	"Dhakaani daashor are the finest weaponsmiths on Khorvaire, their skill at metallurgy outstripping even House Cannith. Their traditions blend mundane skill and transmutation to create and manipulate remarkable alloys, including adamantine, mithral, and byeshk, and Dhakaani champions often wield weapons forged from such material. Dhakaani equipment is designed for durability and efficiency, rarely gaudy or bejeweled. Likewise, armor is tough and flexible—often with the properties of {@item mithral armor||mithral} or {@item adamantine armor}—but not dramatic in style.": "达卡尼人是霍尔韦尔岛上最优秀的武器制造者，他们的冶金技术甚至超过了坎尼斯家族。他们的传统融合了世俗的技能和嬗变，以创造和操纵非凡的合金，包括金刚砂、米塔尔和比塞克，达卡尼的冠军们经常挥舞着用这种材料锻造的武器。达卡尼人的装备是为耐用和高效而设计的，很少有华丽的或镶有宝石的。同样，盔甲也是坚韧而灵活的--通常具有{@item mithral armor||mithral}或{@item adamantine armor}的属性--但在风格上并不夸张。",
	"Dhakaani magic items are either created by the daashor (who specialize in armor and weapons) or by gifted duur'kala. Dhakaani magic rarely focuses on evocation effects, and they have no tradition of elemental binding. While the Dhakaani lack the wide-scale production capacity of House Cannith, they've had thousands of years to build supplies. Elite units are often equipped with uncommon magic items, such as {@item adamantine armor}, {@item cloak of protection||cloaks of protection}, {@item gauntlets of ogre power}, and {@i vola'khesh} (described in chapter 7). Shaarat'khesh assassins may use {@item hat of disguise||hats of disguise}, {@item bag of holding||bags of holding}, or {@item cloak of elvenkind||cloaks of elvenkind}—though not by that name!—and sometimes more powerful weapons, such as {@item dagger of venom||daggers of venom} or {@i Keeper's fangs} (also in chapter 7). So while the Dhakaani dar are relatively few in number compared to the people of the Five Nations, they're not only disciplined and highly skilled, but also well equipped.": "达卡尼人的魔法物品要么是由达索尔（擅长盔甲和武器）创造，要么是由有天赋的杜尔卡拉创造。达卡尼的魔法很少专注于召唤效果，他们也没有元素绑定的传统。虽然达卡尼人缺乏坎尼斯家族那样大规模的生产能力，但他们已经有数千年的时间来建立供应。精英部队通常装备有不常见的魔法物品，如（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）和（%3%）（在第七章中描述）。Shaarat'khesh刺客可能会使用（4%）、（5%）或（6%）--虽然不是这个名字！--有时还会使用更强大的武器，如（7%）或（8%）（也在第七章）。因此，虽然达卡尼人与五国人民相比，人数相对较少，但他们不仅纪律严明，技术高超，而且装备精良。",
	"When the empire was at its height, the daashor and duur'kala could create grand artifacts and eldritch machines, such as {@i Ghaal'duur} and the {@i grieving tree} presented in chapter 7. The creation of such artifacts was never trivial, and relied on remarkable talents, knowledge lost during the daelkyr incursion, and the use of rare substances and planar conjunctions. As such, while it's possible for the Dhakaani to create new artifacts, they are primarily concerned with recovering and reclaiming ancient treasures forged in the past. The Kech Dhakaan are deeply concerned about how many of their treasures have been claimed by chaat'oor, and react with anger toward other species carrying Dhakaani relics.": "当帝国处于鼎盛时期时，daashor和duur'kala可以创造出宏伟的神器和超自然的机器，例如第七章中介绍的{@i Ghaal'duur}和{@i grieving tree}。创造这样的神器绝非易事，它依赖于非凡的天赋、在达尔凯尔入侵期间失去的知识，以及对稀有物质和平面结合的使用。因此，虽然达卡尼人有可能创造新的神器，但他们主要关注的是恢复和回收过去铸造的古代珍宝。Kech Dhakaan人对他们的宝物被Chaat'oor认领的数量深感忧虑，并对携带Dhakaani遗物的其他物种做出愤怒的反应。",
	"As the Kapaa'vola spread and the Empire of Dhakaan quickly unraveled, many of its greatest leaders sealed their followers in deep vaults. Each of these units took responsibility for preserving one of the pillars of the empire. Together, they called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}—the Keepers of the Empire. The name of each individual clan was given based on their chosen ideal; thus the Kech Volaar are Keepers of the Word, and the Kech Shaarat are Keepers of the Sword. Uul'kala helped to coordinate this effort and to maintain communication between the isolated vaults over time, but there are kech vaults that never had uul'kala, and others who lost their uul'kala over time.": "随着卡帕沃拉的蔓延和达卡安帝国的迅速解体，许多最伟大的领导人将他们的追随者封存在深邃的地窖中。这些单位各自负责保护帝国的一个支柱。他们一起称自己为（%0%）--帝国的守护者。每个部族的名字都是根据他们所选择的理想而命名的；因此，Kech Volaar是文字的守护者，而Kech Shaarat是剑的守护者。Uul'kala帮助协调这种努力，并随着时间的推移保持孤立的金库之间的沟通，但有些金库从来没有Uul'kala，还有一些金库随着时间的推移失去了Uul'kala。",
	"Chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} includes general information about the Heirs of Dhakaan, campaign hooks, and possible NPCs. This section expands on the clans named in that chapter, including descriptions of some Keeper clans that are known or active.

	"Of these clans, both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar have made their presence known in Darguun. But while the Darguuls have heard of these clans, they don't fully understand their origins. The other clans are currently obscure and mysterious, though dramatic action could quickly bring them fame—or infamy.": "在这些部族中，Kech Shaarat和Kech Volaar都已在达尔古纳崭露头角。但是，尽管达尔古尔人听说过这些部族，他们并不完全了解它们的起源。其他部族目前还很模糊和神秘，尽管戏剧性的行动可能会很快给他们带来名声--或者臭名昭著。",
	"While the Dhakaani are renowned for their weaponcraft, it may be surpassed by their skill with fortifications and civic engineering. Many of the greatest cities of the Five Nations are built on Dhakaani foundations, and ruins of other Dhakaani fortresses still linger after many thousands of years. These techniques are the treasure guarded by the Kech Draal, and Draal daashor specialize in the transmutation effects and the shaping of earth and stone. Every kech has its architects, just as the Draal have their soldiers and their duur'kala—but stonework and mining are the pride of the Kech Draal.": "虽然达卡尼人以其武器工艺而闻名，但他们在防御工事和市政工程方面的技能可能超过了他们。五国中许多最伟大的城市都建立在达卡尼人的基础上，而其他达卡尼人堡垒的废墟在几千年后仍在徘徊。这些技术是Kech Draal所守护的宝藏，Draal daashor专门研究嬗变效果以及土石的塑造。每个凯奇都有它的建筑师，就像德拉尔人有他们的士兵和他们的duur'kala一样--但石雕和采矿是凯奇德拉尔人的骄傲。",
	"The Kech Draal have little interest in filling the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come. While they look forward to building the next empire, they have no interest in competing with the other Keepers; they seek only the realization of the dream. They have not yet made their presence felt in the world, and it is up to the DM where their deep vault lies. It's possible that they are beneath Wroat or Korth, secretly dwelling below the deepest foundations of a modern capital.": "Kech Draal人对填补尚未到来的皇帝的宝座没有什么兴趣。虽然他们期待着建立下一个帝国，但他们没有兴趣与其他守护者竞争；他们只寻求梦想的实现。他们还没有在这个世界上崭露头角，至于他们深藏的金库在哪里，就要看DM了。他们有可能在沃洛特或科斯的下面，秘密地居住在现代首都最深的地基之下。",
	"The golin'dar play a more central role in the Kech Draal than in many clans. While the clan is formally led by the dirge singer Kuula Dhakaan and the warlord Druun Dhakaan, the ghaal'dar consult with a golin'dar council on all major decisions. The golin'dar Taala is the senior voice on this council, respected for her wisdom and skill.": "与许多部族相比，戈林达尔在凯奇德拉尔扮演着更为核心的角色。虽然该部族正式由唱哀歌的库拉-达卡安和军阀德鲁恩-达卡安领导，但戈林达尔人在所有重大决策上都会与戈林达尔委员会协商。golin'dar Taala是这个委员会中的资深人士，因其智慧和技能而受到尊重。",
	"The neutrality of the Kech Draal can make them a good choice for a Dhakaani character, as they can find a welcome with any of the Keepers. A Draal character might be gathering information about the world, seeking lost treasure, or even just eager to survey the styles of architecture that have developed over the past millennia.": "Kech Draal的中立性可以使他们成为达卡尼角色的一个很好的选择，因为他们可以在任何一个守护者那里找到欢迎。一个Draal角色可能正在收集关于这个世界的信息，寻找丢失的宝藏，甚至只是渴望调查过去几千年来发展起来的建筑风格。",
	"When the kech sages identified the threat posed by the Kapaa'vola, some chose retreat—hiding in the deep vaults and waiting for the curse to pass. One of their leaders, Khaas Dhakaan, had no interest in hiding. Gathering the greatest heroes of the age—Dhakaani champions, Khesh'dar assassins, Gatekeeper orcs—Khaas led his army into the depths of Khyber, and into the demiplane that served as the prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Khaas swore to end the Treacherous Whisper and to recover artifacts stolen by Dyrrn and its minions—artifacts that Khaas believed could restore the splintering empire.": "当凯奇圣人发现卡帕瓦人构成的威胁时，一些人选择了撤退--躲在深邃的地窖里，等待诅咒的到来。他们的领导人之一，哈斯-达卡安，对躲藏没有兴趣。他召集了这个时代最伟大的英雄--达卡尼冠军、克什达尔刺客、守门兽人--哈斯带领他的军队进入凯博尔的深处，并进入作为腐蚀者迪尔恩监狱的半位面。哈斯发誓要结束奸诈的低语，并找回被迪尔恩及其爪牙偷走的文物--哈斯相信这些文物可以恢复分裂的帝国。",

In truth, they were trapped within Dyrrn's demiplane, fighting an endless struggle against the minions of the daelkyr. Time moves strangely in Dyrrn's realm, and by the reckoning of the Ghaalrac, it has been less than three centuries since they set out on their mission. Trapped in a realm of madness, the Ghaalrac have blended Dhakaani and Gatekeeper techniques with the symbionts of the daelkyr, with results that others might find horrifying. They have crafted powerful living weapons and artifacts, along with magebred champions with unnatural powers—armored bugbears with the regenerative abilities of trolls, goblin assassins with the ability to slip through space. They have found ways to bind aberrations to their will, and have forced beholders and grells to serve them.": "无论是在清醒的世界还是在乌尔-达卡安，卡奥斯和他的冠军们再也没有听到任何消息，人们认为他们已经迷失了。事实上，他们被困在迪尔恩的半位面中，与戴尔基尔的爪牙进行无休止的斗争。时间在Dyrrn的领域里走得很奇怪，根据Ghaalrac的计算，从他们出发执行任务到现在还不到三个世纪。困在一个疯狂的领域里，Ghaalrac将达卡尼和守门人的技术与戴尔克尔的共生体融合在一起，其结果是其他人可能会觉得很恐怖。他们制作了强大的活体武器和人工制品，以及具有非自然力量的魔法战士--具有巨魔再生能力的装甲虫人，具有穿越空间能力的地精刺客。他们已经找到了将反常者束缚在自己的意志之下的方法，并强迫信徒和格莱尔人为他们服务。",

While still driven by the goal of fighting aberrations, after hundreds of years in an alien land, the orcs of the Kech Ghaalrac would seem similarly alien to other Gatekeepers.": "与凯奇-盖拉克一起冒险进入开伯尔的守门兽人的后裔至今仍在，他们作为德鲁伊魔法的专家在氏族的种姓制度中找到了自己的位置。然而，这些曾经的守门人所携带的传统与他们的地面同行有很大的不同，部分原因是他们已经与自然世界隔绝。虽然仍以打击异类为目标，但在异地数百年后，凯奇-盖拉克的兽人对其他守门人来说似乎也很陌生。",
	"Now, after centuries of struggle in Khyber, the Kech Ghaalrac have returned. The current leader—who also uses the name Khaas—possesses what the Ghaalrac call {@i Ur'taash}, the \"First Crown.\" It's said that this was the final creation of Jhazaal Dhakaan, forged to unite the empire; it protects his mind, allows him to communicate with Ghaalrac squads across great distances, and possesses powerful coercive abilities. Khaas claims to have torn this crown from Dyrrn's grip as he dealt a mortal blow to the Corruptor. He believes that it is the Ghaalrac who broke the power of the Treacherous Whisper, and that only they can restore the Empire of Dhakaan.": "现在，在开伯尔经过几个世纪的斗争后，凯奇-盖拉克人回来了。现任领导人--他也使用Khaas这个名字--拥有Ghaalrac人所说的（%0%），\"第一皇冠\"。据说这是贾扎尔-达卡安（Jhazaal Dhakaan）的最后创作，是为了统一帝国而铸造的；它保护着他的思想，使他能够与远距离的加拉克小队沟通，并拥有强大的强制能力。哈斯声称在他对腐蚀者进行致命一击时，从迪尔恩的手中撕下了这顶皇冠。他认为，是盖尔拉克人打破了奸诈的低语的力量，只有他们才能恢复达卡安帝国。",
	"Khaas and the other leaders of the Kech Ghaalrac carry the names of heroes of ancient Dhakaan: Torrm of the Gatekeepers, the master assassin known only as Khesh, the mighty guul'dar Korrga. The original heroes are long dead, but these dar claim to be their descendants and carry their ancient weapons. They possess tremendous power, and they intend to use it. But there are many questions about the Kech Ghaalrac. Are they truly what they claim to be, or have they been corrupted by Dyrrn and turned into tools of the daelkyr, whether they realize it or not? They aren't part of the Uul Dhakaan as experienced by the other Keepers, but they have their own version of the dream that sustained them through the long war, and believe that it is the other clans who have lost sight of the dream. The other Keepers will know nothing of the Kech Ghaalrac until the Clan of Heroes reveals itself; will they support Khaas Dhakaan of their own volition, or be compelled by the power of {@i Ur'taash}? Or will the Heirs of Dhakaan oppose these transformed heroes?": "哈斯和凯奇-盖拉克的其他领导人都有着古代达卡安的英雄的名字。守门人的托尔姆（Torrm），只被称为克什（Khesh）的刺客大师，以及强大的古拉尔-科尔加（guul'dar）。最初的英雄们早已死去，但这些达尔人声称是他们的后代，并携带着他们的古老武器。他们拥有巨大的力量，而且他们打算使用它。但是，关于凯奇-加尔拉克有许多问题。他们是否真的像他们声称的那样，或者他们已经被Dyrrn腐蚀，变成了daelkyr的工具，无论他们是否意识到这一点？他们不是其他守护者所经历的乌尔-达卡安的一部分，但他们有自己版本的梦想，这个梦想支撑他们度过了漫长的战争，并相信是其他部族失去了对梦想的关注。其他守卫者对凯奇-盖拉克一无所知，直到英雄部族显露出来；他们是出于自愿支持凯奇-达卡安，还是被{@i Ur'taash}的力量所蛊惑？或者达卡安的继承人会反对这些变身后的英雄们吗？",
	"The Kech Ghaalrac can appear anywhere that suits the needs of the campaign. When they appear, it should be dramatic. One option is for them to seize the Gathering Stone, House Deneith's fortress in Darguun; this strikes a dramatic blow against chaat'oor and gives the Ghaalrac an opportunity to bend Darguuls to their will. Khaas Dhakaan believes that dar and Darguul alike are all flawed—but that all can be redeemed by the power of Ur'taash.": "Kech Ghaalrac可以出现在任何适合活动需要的地方。当他们出现时，应该是戏剧性的。一个选择是让他们夺取聚集之石，即迪尼斯家族在达尔古恩的堡垒；这对查特奥尔来说是一个戏剧性的打击，也给了盖尔拉克一个让达尔古尔人屈服于他们意志的机会。哈斯-达卡安认为，达尔和达尔古尔都是有缺陷的，但都可以通过乌尔塔什的力量得到救赎。",
	"The Kech Ghaalrac is an unlikely origin for a player character; their story works best when people don't know if they have been corrupted or are righteous, despite their unnatural tools and techniques. However, a Dhakaani character from another kech could be determined to uncover the truth about the Kech Ghaalrac. Or a character could be the distant descendant of one of the Ghaalrac heroes, seeking to learn the final fate of their ancestor and to recover a prized relic from the Ghaalrac champion who carries it.": "Kech Ghaalrac对于玩家角色来说是一个不太可能的起源；他们的故事在人们不知道他们是被腐蚀了还是正直的时候效果最好，尽管他们有非自然的工具和技术。然而，一个来自另一个Kech的Dhakaani角色可以决心揭开Kech Ghaalrac的真相。或者一个角色可能是盖尔拉克英雄之一的远方后裔，寻求了解他们祖先的最终命运，并从带着它的盖尔拉克冠军那里找回一个珍贵的遗物。",
	"Siege warfare and combat engineering are the specialties of the Kech Hashraac. The Dhakaani don't employ siege staffs or evokers, and the Hashraac has spent generations developing new weapons to dominate the battlefield. If the DM wishes to add the conventional firearms and cannons presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to a campaign, the Kech Hashraac could have developed these weapons during their long isolation. Alternatively, the Hashraac could specialize in the enhanced artillery described in chapter 1, alchemical explosives, or an entirely new form of weapon.": "攻城战和战斗工程是凯奇哈什拉克的专长。达卡尼人不采用攻城杖或驱逐者，哈什拉克人花了几代人的时间来开发新的武器，以主宰战场。如果DM希望在战役中加入{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中介绍的常规火器和大炮，那么凯奇-哈什拉克人可以在长期与世隔绝的过程中发展这些武器。或者，哈什拉克人可以专门研究第一章中描述的强化火炮、炼金炸药或一种全新的武器形式。",
	"The Kech Hashraac have yet to reveal their presence to the world at large. While few in number, the force they command could be vital in any conflict that lies ahead. Will they support another kech claiming the imperial throne, or will they pursue it themselves? The warlord Duul Hashraac leads the clan; he is noteworthy both for being a daashor as opposed to a common warrior, and for using his clan name instead of \"Dhakaan\" as his sobriquet. Duul is proud of what his people have achieved; whether he seeks the throne or serves as kingmaker, he believes the Kech Hashraac hold the keys to Dhakaani victory.": "Kech Hashraac还没有向整个世界展示他们的存在。虽然人数不多，但他们指挥的力量在未来的任何冲突中都是至关重要的。他们是支持另一个要求获得帝国王位的凯奇，还是自己追求王位？军阀杜尔-哈什拉克（Duul Hashraac）领导着该部族；他值得注意的是，他是一名达沙尔人，而不是一名普通的战士，而且他使用自己的部族名称而不是 \"达卡安 \"作为自己的绰号。杜尔为他的族人所取得的成就感到自豪；无论他是寻求王位还是担任决策者，他都认为凯奇-哈什拉克人掌握着达卡尼人胜利的钥匙。",
	"The Kech Hashraac are a logical choice for a Dhakaani Artillerist artificer; the artificer's magic can be tied to the tools the DM chooses to provide to these Keepers. A Hashraac player character could be dispatched to study the battle magic of the Five Nations, to seek out rare components needed for new weapons, or to investigate the Mournland and the theory that the Mourning was caused by battle magic. Alternatively, a Hashraac artificer could have left the clan to pursue their own unorthodox weapons research, hoping to return in triumph once they have perfected their techniques.": "Kech Hashraac是达卡尼炮兵工匠的合理选择；工匠的魔法可以与DM选择提供给这些守卫者的工具相联系。一个哈什拉克玩家角色可以被派去研究五国的战斗魔法，寻找新武器所需的稀有部件，或者调查哀伤之地和哀伤是由战斗魔法引起的理论。或者，一个哈什拉克工匠可能已经离开了部落，去追求他们自己的非正统武器研究，希望在他们完善了他们的技术后凯旋而归。",
	"Long ago, interaction with the Aereni line of Vol led to the dirge singer Iraala becoming the first dar vampire. She shared this gift with her lover, the warlord Muurat. In the centuries that passed, the two were placed in charge of the covert operations of the empire. Spying and assassination remained the domain of the Khesh'dar, but the Kech Nasaar served both as internal security and as commandos specializing in guerilla tactics and psychological warfare. It was the Kech Nasaar who first recognized the threat of the Kapaa'vola, and set the Keeper seclusion in motion.": "很久以前，与沃尔的Aereni系的互动导致了哀歌歌手伊拉拉成为第一个达尔吸血鬼。她与她的情人，军阀穆拉特分享了这种天赋。在过去的几个世纪里，这两个人被安排负责帝国的秘密行动。间谍和暗杀仍然是克什达尔人的领域，但凯奇-纳萨尔人既是内部安全人员，也是专门从事游击战术和心理战的突击队员。正是Kech Nasaar首先认识到了卡帕瓦人的威胁，并启动了守护者的隐居计划。",
	"Over their long seclusion, the Kech Nasaar have continued to study unconventional paths of warfare. Nasaar duur'kala often train in the techniques of the bardic College of Whispers, while elite soldiers of the Kech Nasaar might be {@class ranger||Gloom Stalker rangers|gloom stalker|XGE}. Under the leadership of Iraala and Muurat, the Nasaar have also explored the arts of necromancy, though it's up to the DM to decide just how far they've continued down this path. Do they have squads of vampire commandos? Have they developed entirely new forms of undead? Given their penchant for psychological warfare, Nasaar agents could sow terror and confusion by raising the bones of soldiers who died in the Last War, making it seem like the vengeful dead yearned to continue the battle. Or perhaps the Nasaar have developed techniques allowing them to seize control of undead raised by other necromancers—a technique that could cause untold chaos in Karrnath.": "在长期的隐居生活中，凯奇纳萨尔人一直在研究非常规的战争方式。Nasaar duur'kala经常训练吟游诗人学院的技术，而Kech Nasaar的精英士兵可能是（%0%）。在伊拉拉和穆拉特的领导下，纳萨尔人也探索了死灵的艺术，不过这要由DM来决定他们在这条路上走了多远。他们有吸血鬼突击队吗？他们是否开发了全新的亡灵形式？鉴于他们对心理战的偏爱，纳萨尔特工可以通过抬起在最后战争中死去的士兵的骨头来制造恐怖和混乱，让人觉得这些复仇的死者渴望继续战斗。或者，纳萨尔人已经开发出了允许他们控制其他死灵法师养育的亡灵的技术--这种技术可以在卡尔纳特造成巨大的混乱。",
	"Iraala and Muurat continue to lead the clan, giving a direct tie to the ancient empire. The edict of a long-dead emperor asserted that no dead creature could wear the imperial crown; while the services of the Nasaar were valued, the dead are severed from the Uul Dhakaan and cannot draw on the wisdom of the past or see Jhazaal's dream. The Nasaar could have fallen into true darkness in their isolation, and now seek to seize power for themselves. On the other hand, despite being cut off from the Uul Dhakaan, Iraala and Muurat remember the actual glory of the fallen empire, and could be the truest devotees of the concepts of muut and atcha, placing the needs of the empire above their personal ambitions. As in ancient times, they might seek to guide the living emperor, and to ensure the Dhakaani Empire follows the proper course.": "Iraala和Muurat继续领导该部族，使其与古代帝国有着直接的联系。一位早已去世的皇帝的诏书断言，任何死去的生物都不能戴上帝国的王冠；虽然纳萨尔人的服务受到重视，但死者与乌尔-达卡安断绝了联系，不能吸取过去的智慧，也不能看到贾扎尔的梦想。Nasaar可能在与世隔绝中陷入真正的黑暗，现在寻求为自己夺取权力。另一方面，尽管被切断了与乌尔-达卡安的联系，但伊拉拉和穆拉特还记得堕落帝国的实际荣耀，他们可能是穆特和阿查概念的最忠实信徒，将帝国的需求置于个人野心之上。就像在古代一样，他们可能会寻求指导活着的皇帝，并确保达卡尼帝国遵循正确的路线。",
	"A player character from the Kech Nasaar could follow unusual paths. A Nasaar dar might be gathering information for the clan, or they could be tasked to monitor the activities of the other Keepers, especially the Kech Ghaalrac and Kech Shaarat. Iraala may have hidden artifacts across Khorvaire before the fall; a Nasaar character could seek to recover these in her service, or could have gone rogue to pursue one of these treasures.": "一个来自Kech Nasaar的玩家角色可以走不寻常的路。一个Nasaar dar可能在为家族收集信息，或者他们可能被指派去监视其他守护者的活动，特别是Kech Ghaalrac和Kech Shaarat。Iraala可能在堕落之前就在Khorvaire各地隐藏了神器；一个Nasaar角色可以在她的服务下寻求恢复这些神器，也可能是为了追求这些宝藏而叛变。",
	"Beasts served many important roles in the Empire of Dhakaan. The Ruuska dar fill much the same role that House Vadalis does for the Five Nations: tending and training the many beasts of the empire, while always searching for—or creating—new beasts to fill a need. {@i Ruuska} is the Goblin word for \"tiger,\" and tigers and dire tigers are often used as cavalry in the vanguard of Dhakaani armies. But the Kech Ruuska breed all manner of beasts, from fierce guardians to clever messengers and simple livestock.": "野兽在达卡安帝国扮演着许多重要角色。鲁伊斯卡达尔的作用与瓦达里斯家族对五国的作用基本相同：照顾和训练帝国的众多野兽，同时一直在寻找或创造新的野兽来满足需求。{@i Ruuska}是哥布林语中 \"老虎 \"的意思，老虎和猛虎经常被用作达卡尼军队的先锋部队的骑兵。但凯奇-鲁伊斯卡人饲养各种类型的野兽，从凶猛的守护者到聪明的信使和简单的牲畜。",
	"Just as there are soldiers in every kech, there are tenders in every vault who maintain the beasts of that vault. However, the Kech Ruuska specialize in breeding and training them, producing the finest Beast Master rangers, and keeping the widest range of exotic creatures in their arsenals. The Ruuska also work with magebreeding and may have produced entirely new beasts or monstrosities previously unknown on the surface. While the Ruuska don't have a spiritual bond to the natural world, they might have developed a form of druid—a Moon druid serving as a specialist in assuming animal forms and controlling beasts. The Ruuska have also experimented with lycanthropy. It's up to the DM to decide if they were able to control and weaponize the curse, if their efforts ultimately came to nothing, or if lycanthropy has spread throughout the Ruuska—a secret they are concealing from the other clans.": "就像每个凯奇都有士兵一样，每个金库都有维护该金库的野兽的补给员。然而，Kech Ruuska专门从事繁殖和训练它们，生产最好的野兽大师游侠，并在他们的武库中保留最广泛的异国生物。鲁伊斯卡人还致力于魔力繁殖，并可能生产出全新的野兽或怪兽，这些都是以前在地面上不为人知的。虽然鲁伊斯卡人与自然界没有精神上的联系，但他们可能已经发展出一种德鲁伊--一个月球德鲁伊，作为拥有动物形态和控制野兽的专家。鲁伊斯卡人也曾试验过狼人的行为。如果他们能够控制诅咒并将其武器化，如果他们的努力最终一无所获，或者如果狼人症已经蔓延到整个鲁伊斯卡--一个他们对其他部族隐瞒的秘密，那就由DM决定。",
	"The Kech Ruuska are led by the Beast Master warlord Lhaar Dhakaan and the duur'kala Oruul. The Kech Shaarat are putting considerable pressure on the Ruuska to support their claim to the crown. It remains to be seen if Lhaar bows to these threats, or whether the Ruuska seek an alliance that lets them turn the tables on the powerful Shaarat.": "Kech Ruuska由野兽大师军阀Lhaar Dhakaan和duur'kala Oruul领导。Kech Shaarat对Ruuska施加了相当大的压力，以支持他们对王位的要求。Lhaar是否会向这些威胁低头，或者鲁伊斯卡是否会寻求一个联盟，让他们与强大的沙拉特人翻脸，这都有待观察。",

The clan can also be an interesting way to add new or exotic beasts or monstrosities into the world, and could be an intriguing foil for a storyline involving House Vadalis.": "凯奇-鲁伊斯卡是达卡尼游侠的一个不错的选择。该部族也是一种有趣的方式，可以将新的或异国的野兽或怪兽加入到这个世界中，并且可以成为涉及瓦达里斯家族的故事情节的一个有趣的衬托。",

Founded by the Warlord of the South in the final days of the empire, the Shaarat possess an artifact known as Skai Shaarat—the Great Blade—a sword handed down from warlord to warlord since the days of the Six Kings. While they lack the exotic specialties of the other clans, the Kech Shaarat excel at war. The deep vault of the Kech Shaarat is tied to a demiplane in Khyber known as the Ironlands. This provided them with access to resources and space denied to the other clans, including the byeshk ore the Dhakaani prize for their weapons (as presented in chapter 7), while also keeping them on a constant war footing. Of all the Keepers, the Kech Shaarat have the finest Forge Adept artificers (a new specialization presented in chapter 6), as well as talented Battle Smiths—though the Dhakaani don't generally employ constructs, these artificers have created innovative steel defenders. On the other hand, the Kech Shaarat have not emphasized the role of the duur'kala as much as other clans, and have a weaker bardic tradition.": "Kech Shaarat是最大的守卫者部族。由南方军阀在帝国最后的日子里建立，Shaarat拥有一件被称为Skai Shaarat的神器--大刀--一把自六王时代以来从军阀传到军阀的剑。虽然他们缺乏其他部族的异国特产，但凯奇-沙哈拉特人擅长战争。凯奇-沙拉特的深层金库与开伯尔的一个被称为铁地的半位面联系在一起。这为他们提供了其他部族所无法获得的资源和空间，包括达卡尼人奖励给他们的武器的byeshk矿石（如第七章所介绍的），同时也使他们一直处于战争状态。在所有的守护者中，Kech Shaarat拥有最优秀的锻造专家工匠（第六章介绍的新专业），以及有天赋的战斗工匠--尽管达卡尼人一般不使用构造物，但这些工匠已经创造了创新的钢铁防御者。另一方面，Kech Shaarat没有像其他部族那样强调duur'kala的作用，并且有一个较弱的吟游诗人传统。",
	"The Kech Shaarat have emerged into the open and are the most active of the Dhakaani tribes. The warlord Ruus Dhakaan (no relation to the Kech Ruuska, though his name does mean \"Tiger\") has reclaimed several ancient Dhakaani fortresses in the Seawall Mountains, and is working to refortify these ruins. In the course of this expansion, the Kech Shaarat have already absorbed a lesser clan—the Kech Nozhii, who maintained the treasury of the empire—which has expanded their resources. They are actively pressuring the Kech Ruuska to submit to an alliance acknowledging Ruus as the Emperor Yet to Come, and Shaarat warriors have a bitter rivalry with the Kech Volaar.": "Kech Shaarat人已经出现在公开场合，是达卡尼部落中最活跃的。军阀鲁斯-达卡安（Ruus Dhakaan）（与凯奇-鲁斯卡没有关系，尽管他的名字确实是 \"老虎 \"的意思）已经收复了海堤山脉的几个古代达卡尼堡垒，并正在努力重新加固这些废墟。在这一扩张过程中，凯奇-沙拉特已经吸收了一个较小的部族--凯奇-诺兹伊，他们维持着帝国的国库，这扩大了他们的资源。他们积极向凯奇-鲁伊斯卡施压，要求其加入承认鲁伊斯为未来皇帝的联盟，而沙拉特的战士与凯奇-沃拉尔有激烈的竞争。",

Ruus hasn't revealed the true nature of his people or the full scale of his forces to the Ghaal'dar, and most Darguuls believe the Kech Shaarat are a Ghaal'dar clan with strange traditions. House Deneith is keen to gain the services of these mysterious warriors, but Ruus Dhakaan refuses to have any dealings with the chaat'oor. Ruus Dhakaan is a brilliant strategist and charismatic leader. He earned {@i Skai Shaarat} with his courage and skill, and should never be underestimated. While he's determined to claim the imperial throne, he's also concerned with muut and the good of the empire; he will pressure other Keepers to support his claim, but won't butcher his own kind. However, he's ruthless when it comes to dealing with chaat'oor, and doubts whether the modern \"goblins\" can be redeemed. They may be close enough to dar that they could be worthy servants, but he's considering whether it's simpler to slaughter the Darguuls once the dar are united.": "Ruus已经派代表到Rhukaan Draal，并承诺支持Lhesh Haruuc，但这是一个旨在等待时间和衡量敌人的诡计。鲁斯还没有向盖尔达尔透露他的人民的真实性质和他的全部势力规模，大多数达尔古尔人认为凯奇沙拉特是一个有着奇怪传统的盖尔达尔部族。德尼兹家族热衷于获得这些神秘战士的服务，但鲁伊斯-达卡安拒绝与恰特奥尔人有任何往来。鲁斯-达卡安是一位杰出的战略家和富有魅力的领导人。他以自己的勇气和技巧赢得了{@i Skai Shaarat}，永远不应该被低估。虽然他决心夺取帝国的王位，但他也关心穆特和帝国的利益；他会向其他守卫者施压以支持他的要求，但不会屠杀自己的同类。然而，当涉及到处理Chaat'oor时，他是无情的，并怀疑现代 \"妖精 \"是否可以被救赎。他们可能足够接近达尔，可以成为值得信赖的仆人，但他正在考虑一旦达尔联合起来，屠杀达尔古尔人是否更简单。",
	"The Kech Shaarat are the most aggressive of the clans, and this is an interesting option for an entire party of dar adventurers.

The monks of the Kech Uul are devoted to protecting the dream from outside influences, but they're also experts in navigating the dream itself; if a Dhakaani dreamer is searching for a particular memory or wishes to speak with the dreamvestige of an ancient hero, a Kech Uul monk can be an invaluable guide. Likewise, the uul'kala of the Dream Keepers are the backbone of long-distance communication between clans; the uul'kala maintain message stations at various points within the dream, and can pass a message from one dreamer to another.": "Kech Uul人还没有回到Khorvaire的表面。他们的人大部分时间都在Uul Dhakaan本身，使用药物和冥想来进入梦境，甚至在醒来的时候。Kech Uul的僧侣们致力于保护梦境不受外界影响，但他们也是驾驭梦境本身的专家；如果达卡尼的梦者正在寻找一段特殊的记忆，或希望与古代英雄的梦遗体对话，Kech Uul的僧侣可以成为一个无价的向导。同样，守梦人的uul'kala是部族间长途通信的骨干；uul'kala在梦境中的各个点维持着信息站，并能将信息从一个梦者传递给另一个梦者。",
	"There are several ways that the Kech Uul could fit into a campaign. They can serve as a neutral resource supporting all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance through the dream. However, it could be that they're not what they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect Jhazaal's dream from outside influences, but it's possible the clan has been partially or fully replaced by quori imposters, who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the ends of the Dreaming Dark. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was destroyed long ago by the daelkyr or another threat; the Dream Keepers continue to serve their function, but they're actually long dead, and the chot'uul encountered in the Uul are simply dream-vestiges, memories lingering in Dal Quor.": "Kech Uul可以通过几种方式融入到一个活动中。他们可以作为一个中立的资源支持所有的部族，通过梦想保持沟通并提供指导。然而，他们可能并不像他们看起来那样。Kech Uul一直致力于保护Jhazaal的梦境不受外界影响，但有可能该部族已经部分或全部被Quori冒名顶替，他们计划影响尚未到来的皇帝，为黑暗梦境的目的服务。也可能Kech Uul在很久以前就被daelkyr或其他威胁摧毁了；守梦人继续发挥着他们的作用，但他们实际上早就死了，而在Uul中遇到的chot'uul只是梦的遗迹，在Dal Quor徘徊的记忆。",
	"The name of the Kech Uul's current leader is unknown outside the clan. Uul dar often wear masks or veils; they do not seek atcha, and desire only to help others achieve Jhazaal's dream.": "凯奇-乌尔族目前的领导人的名字在族外不为人知。乌尔达尔经常戴着面具或面纱；他们不寻求阿查，只希望帮助别人实现贾扎尔的梦想。",
	"A player character tied to the Uul dar could be an uul'kala, a bard (likely of the College of Glamour) pursuing a dream-vision or searching for dream-related artifacts. An exotic possibility is that the character believes it's possible to bring other species into the Uul Dhakaan, allowing for a peaceful union; if this is the case, is this goal supported by the clan elders, or is the character an eccentric renegade? Alternatively, any dar character could have a mentor from the Uul dar, who visits them in their dreams offering guidance and inspiration.": "一个与乌尔达卡联系在一起的玩家角色可能是一个乌尔卡拉，一个追求梦境的吟游诗人（可能是魅力学院的）或寻找与梦境有关的文物。一个异乎寻常的可能性是，这个角色相信有可能将其他物种带入Uul Dhakaan，从而实现和平的结合；如果是这样的话，这个目标是否得到部落长老的支持，或者这个角色是一个古怪的叛逆者？另外，任何达尔角色都可以有一个来自乌尔达尔的导师，他在梦中拜访他们，提供指导和灵感。",
	"The Kech Volaar believe that knowledge is power. Their deep vault holds scrolls and tablets recording thousands of years of imperial history.

	"While the Volaar weaponsmiths aren't a match for those of the Kech Shaarat, the clan leaders recognize the value of arcane magic over pure mundane might. The Volaar have long worked to push the limits of duur'kala magic, and to master the techniques that created wonders such as the Uul Dhakaan and the greatest artifacts of the old empire. The Volaar have experimented with warlocks—working with supernatural patrons under carefully controlled conditions—and sought to cultivate sorcerers when they have appeared among the dar populace. Since their return to the surface, the Kech Volaar are working both to recover the greatest artifacts and treasures of the empire, and to study the arcane techniques of the modern gath'dar. Where the Kech Shaarat believe that Dhakaani might can sweep aside any enemy, the Volaar recognize the arcane power wielded by the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and are doing everything they can to study and master this unfamiliar science.": "虽然沃拉尔的武器工匠无法与凯奇-沙拉特的武器工匠相比，但族长们认识到奥术的价值高于纯粹的世俗力量。长期以来，沃拉尔人一直致力于突破duur'kala魔法的极限，并掌握创造奇迹的技术，如Uul Dhakaan和旧帝国最伟大的神器。沃拉尔人对术士进行了实验--在精心控制的条件下与超自然的赞助人一起工作，并在达尔人中出现巫师时寻求培养他们。自从他们回到地面后，凯奇-沃拉尔人正在努力恢复帝国最伟大的文物和宝藏，并研究现代gath'dar的神秘技术。凯奇-沙拉特人相信达卡尼人的力量可以横扫任何敌人，而沃拉尔人则认识到五国和龙纹屋所挥舞的奥术力量，并竭尽全力研究和掌握这一陌生的科学。",
	"Perhaps because of this, the Kech Volaar are also the most conciliatory of the Keeper clans. They are the most willing to interact with the gath'dar, both because they recognize the need to understand these possible enemies, and in the hopes that some form of coexistence may be possible. Like the Kech Uul, Volaar leader Tuura Dhakaan wonders if the Uul Dhakaan can expand to incorporate other creatures—if the empire can unite gath'dar as it does the dar.": "也许正因为如此，凯奇-沃拉尔也是守护者部族中最具有和解性的。他们最愿意与加斯达尔人交流，因为他们认识到需要了解这些可能的敌人，并希望有可能实现某种形式的共存。就像Kech Uul一样，Volaar的领导人Tuura Dhakaan想知道Uul Dhakaan是否能扩展到其他生物--如果帝国能像对待达尔人一样团结gath'dar。",

They are the Keepers of History, and they know the sacrifices their ancestors had to make and the bitter wars against the chaat'or and the {@i taarn} (elves). They are wise and willing to seek all paths to prosperity, but will never surrender the dream of the eternal empire.": "尽管有这些希望，凯奇-沃拉尔人对达尔的奉献高于一切。他们是历史的守护者，他们知道他们的祖先不得不做出的牺牲，以及与恰特人和（%0%）（精灵）的痛苦战争。他们是明智的，愿意寻求所有的繁荣之路，但永远不会放弃永恒的帝国之梦。",
	"Tuura Dhakaan has revealed herself to the world, and has sent representatives to the court of Lhesh Haruuc. Like the Kech Shaarat, the Volaar have concealed their true history and power. Volaar duur'kala often travel among the Ghaal'dar sharing stories, helping to educate them about their glorious past and the traditions of muut and atcha; this ties to Tuura's hopes that the \"goblins\" can be redeemed and drawn back to their past glory. Tuura is determined to claim the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come; she hopes to find the strength needed to compel the Kech Shaarat through reclaiming powerful artifacts and building allies.": "图拉-达卡安已经向世界表明了自己的身份，并派代表前往勒什-哈鲁克的宫廷。与凯奇沙拉特人一样，沃拉尔人也隐瞒了他们的真实历史和权力。Volaar duur'kala经常在Ghaal'dar中旅行，分享故事，帮助他们了解他们光荣的过去以及muut和atcha的传统；这与图拉希望 \"妖精 \"能够被救赎并被吸引回他们过去的荣耀联系在一起。图拉决心夺取尚未到来的皇帝的宝座；她希望通过夺回强大的文物和建立盟友，找到迫使凯奇沙拉特的力量。",
	"The Kech Volaar are one of the most active Dhakaani clans. Adventurers could encounter Volaar reclaimers across Khorvaire as they search for Dhakaani relics. A Volaar wizard or artificer could be struggling to master the techniques of the gath'dar, while a duur'kala could be an envoy sent to recover an ancient treasure or to seek allies among the outsiders.": "凯奇-沃拉尔是最活跃的达卡尼部族之一。冒险者在搜索达卡尼遗物时，可能会在霍尔韦尔各地遇到沃拉尔开垦者。沃拉尔的巫师或工匠可能正在努力掌握gath'dar的技术，而duur'kala则可能是被派来回收古代宝藏或在外来者中寻求盟友的特使。",
	"Under Dhakaani tradition, the golin'dar—goblins—are traditionally laborers and artisans. While the guul'dar and ghaal'dar train for war, the golin'dar maintain the hearth. But there is a force that stands outside this tradition, lurking in the shadows of the Dhakaani Empire. These are the {@i Khesh'dar}—the Silent Folk—golin'dar who use their speed and cunning as spies, scouts, and assassins.": "根据达卡尼的传统，戈林达尔--哥布林--传统上是劳动者和工匠。当Guul'dar和Ghaal'dar为战争进行训练时，Golin'dar则负责维护炉灶。但是有一股力量站在这个传统之外，潜伏在达卡尼帝国的阴影中。这些人是{@i Khesh'dar}--沉默的人民--戈林达尔，他们利用自己的速度和狡猾作为间谍、侦察员和暗杀者。",
	"While the Khesh'dar are part of the Uul Dhakaan, they have always remained separate from its traditions. They have always served the emperor and their warlords, but they do so in their own time. Their refuges have always been hidden, even before the Kapaa'vola. The ascetic Khesh'dar aren't compelled by money or power; they choose when to offer aid, and set a fair price on their services. The Khesh'dar take no sides in disputes between clans, and they do not seek to rule; in the present day they serve both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar. However, they don't accept missions that they see as threatening the empire itself; as a result, they rarely accept a charge to kill a warlord or a duur'kala.": "虽然Khesh'dar人是Uul Dhakaan的一部分，但他们一直与它的传统保持分离。他们一直为皇帝和他们的军阀服务，但他们在自己的时间内这样做。他们的避难所一直都是隐蔽的，甚至在卡帕奥沃拉之前也是如此。苦行僧Khesh'dar并不为金钱或权力所迫；他们选择何时提供援助，并为他们的服务设定一个公平的价格。Khesh'dar在部族之间的争端中不偏袒任何一方，他们也不寻求统治；在今天，他们同时为Kech Shaarat和Kech Volaar服务。然而，他们不接受他们认为威胁到帝国本身的任务；因此，他们很少接受杀死军阀或duur'kala的指控。",
	"Because of this long tradition of secrecy, even the warlords of the Kech Dhakaan don't know where the vaults of the Khesh'dar are located, or just how many of the Silent Folk are out there. Goblins are spread throughout Khorvaire and most of the great cities of the Five Nations have significant goblin populations, and this provides an easy opportunity for the Khesh'dar to move freely throughout the modern world without drawing attention. The Khesh'dar have been active throughout the last century, spying on the chaat'oor and building up resources and safe houses across the Five Nations. They've recruited many eyes among the modern city goblins and the goblins of Darguun, though these contacts rarely understand exactly who they are dealing with. The Khesh'dar likewise have spies and agents among the golin'dar of every Keeper clan, ensuring that there are few secrets hidden from the Silent Folk.": "由于这种长期的保密传统，即使是凯奇达卡安的军阀也不知道Khesh'dar的金库在哪里，或者到底有多少沉默的民兵在那里。妖精遍布霍尔韦尔，五国的大多数大城市都有大量的妖精人口，这为Khesh'dar提供了一个轻松的机会，可以在整个现代世界自由移动而不引起注意。Khesh'dar在上个世纪一直很活跃，他们监视Chaat'oor，并在整个五国建立了资源和安全屋。他们在现代城市的地精和达尔古恩的地精中招募了许多眼线，尽管这些眼线很少了解他们到底在和谁打交道。Khesh'dar同样在每个守卫者部族的golin'dar中都有间谍和代理人，确保没有什么秘密可以瞒过沉默的民俗。",
	"The Khesh'dar are split into two primary traditions. The Taarka'khesh (\"Silent Wolves\") are swift scouts, experts in wilderness reconnaissance and targeted strikes. The Taarka'khesh typically rely on worg cavalry; many develop an unusual primal bond with their worg companions, and the golin'dar view the worgs as partners, not beasts. Though worgs don't have an innate tie to the Uul Dhakaan, the Beast Master rangers of the Taarka'khesh can summon their worg companions to them while dreaming.": "Khesh'dar分为两个主要传统。Taarka'khesh（\"沉默的狼\"）是迅速的侦察兵，是野外侦察和目标打击的专家。Taarka'khesh通常依靠虫族骑兵；许多人与他们的虫族同伴建立了不寻常的原始联系，而戈林达尔人将虫族视为伙伴，而不是野兽。虽然虫族与乌尔-达卡安（Uul Dhakaan）没有天生的联系，但塔尔卡赫什（Taarka'khesh）的野兽大师游骑兵可以在做梦时将他们的虫族同伴召唤过来。",
	"The second Khesh'dar tradition is that of the Shaarat'khesh (\"Silent Blades\"), spies and assassins trained to operate within cities. Both usually operate covertly, disguised to blend in with the local goblin population. However, each order has a distinctive half-mask that is worn over the lower face during formal interactions.": "第二个Khesh'dar的传统是Shaarat'khesh（\"无声之刃\"），这些间谍和刺客被训练成在城市中行动。两者通常都是秘密行动，伪装成与当地的地精人口融为一体。然而，每个教团都有一个独特的半面罩，在正式交往时戴在下脸。",
	"It's up to the DM to decide just how widespread the Khesh'dar are. They may have a single deep vault and only a few hundred operatives, or it could be that they are the largest of the Dhakaani clans, with outposts hidden across Khorvaire. They may have been building networks for thousands of years, simply waiting for the Keepers to rise before putting these resources to use. But are they truly content to serve any emperor? Or do the Khesh'dar have a hidden agenda of their own? Is it possible that they're tied to the Lords of Dust... or even to the dragons of the Chamber?": "Khesh'dar的范围有多广，这取决于DM的决定。他们可能只有一个深库和几百名特工，也可能是达卡尼家族中最大的一个，他们的前哨站隐藏在整个Khorvaire。他们可能已经建立了数千年的网络，只是在等待守护者的崛起，然后将这些资源投入使用。但他们真的满足于为任何皇帝服务吗？还是赫斯达尔人有他们自己的隐藏计划？他们是否有可能与尘土领主......甚至与商会的龙联系在一起？",
	"The Khesh'dar could serve as an espionage agency patron for a group of golin'dar adventurers. More likely, a single character could be an undercover operative of the Khesh'dar, either pursuing a deep, long-term mission or simply gathering intelligence while waiting for specific orders. It's not unusual for the Khesh'dar to seek to cultivate useful allies among the gath'dar. It would be unusual for one of the Khesh'dar to explain their traditions to an outsider, but it's not impossible that a Khesh'dar could form a bond to a gath'dar comrade over the course of their adventures.": "Khesh'dar可以作为一群Golin'dar冒险者的间谍机构的赞助人。更有可能的是，一个角色可以成为Khesh'dar的卧底，要么追求一个深入的、长期的任务，要么只是在等待具体命令时收集情报。Khesh'dar寻求在gath'dar中培养有用的盟友，这并不罕见。一个克什米尔人向外人解释他们的传统是不寻常的，但克什米尔人在冒险的过程中与加斯达尔人的同志建立起联系也不是不可能。",
	"Members of the Kech Dhakaan can be found across the world, seeking information, relics, and pursuing the goals of their people. They can be deadly foes—or unexpected allies against a common foe. While most of the characters on the {@table Dhakaani NPCs|ExploringEberron} table aren't spies, they won't volunteer information about their people or background unless they come to know and trust someone; generally, they allow others to believe that they're from an obscure Darguun clan.": "Kech Dhakaan的成员在世界各地都能找到，他们寻求信息、遗物，并追求他们的人民的目标。他们可以是致命的敌人，也可以是对抗共同敌人的意外盟友。虽然{@table Dhakaani NPCs|ExploringEberron}表上的大多数人物都不是间谍，但他们不会主动提供关于自己民族或背景的信息，除非他们认识并信任某人；一般来说，他们会让别人相信他们来自一个不起眼的达官氏族。",
	"For the Kech Dhakaan emerging from their vaults, the modern world is a waking nightmare. Modern goblinoids are hollow mockeries of the true dar. Foul chaat'oor hold the lands of the empire and pillage the treasures of the People. But the dar still have their dream. They know what the world should be, and know that together, somehow, they can defy the chaat'oor and restore the eternal empire. However, a long path lies ahead. The dar are badly outnumbered, and can't take on all of the Five Nations in open combat. They don't yet understand the enemy or know what they're capable of. The Kech Volaar, in particular, realize the power of the wide magic of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and recognize they need to know more. There's also the question of whether there's any hope for the modern goblinoids. Can they be instilled with Dhakaani values? Or are they no better than chaat'oor?": "对于从地窖里走出来的凯奇-达卡人来说，现代世界是一场清醒的噩梦。现代的妖精是真正的达尔的空洞的嘲弄。肮脏的Chaat'oor占据着帝国的土地，掠夺着人民的财物。但达尔人仍然有他们的梦想。他们知道这个世界应该是什么样子的，并且知道，他们一起，以某种方式，可以打败查特奥尔，恢复永恒的帝国。然而，前面有一条漫长的道路。达尔人人数众多，不可能在公开的战斗中对付所有的五国人。他们还不了解敌人，也不知道他们有什么能力。尤其是凯奇-沃拉尔人，他们意识到了五国和龙纹屋的广泛魔法的力量，并认识到他们需要了解更多。还有一个问题是，现代地精是否有任何希望。他们能被灌输达卡尼的价值观吗？还是他们比Chaat'oor好不了多少？",
	"Only a new emperor can make this decision. But the last emperor was lost to the Kapaa'vola before the Kech Dhakaan descended into the depths, and no single kech has the power to create a new emperor. The duur'kala speak of the Emperor Yet To Come, with the belief that once all the Keepers rise, a single emperor will somehow win universal acclaim, uniting them all against the chaat'oor. But whether they be lhesh, duur'kala, or daashor, it's unclear what will bring this to pass.": "只有一个新的皇帝才能做出这个决定。但在Kech Dhakaan坠入深渊之前，上一任皇帝已被Kapaa'vola夺走，没有任何一个Kech有能力创造一个新皇帝。duur'kala人谈论的是 \"尚未到来的皇帝\"，他们相信一旦所有的守护者崛起，一个单一的皇帝将以某种方式赢得普遍的赞誉，将他们全部联合起来对抗Chaat'oor。但无论他们是Lhesh、duur'kala还是daashor，都不清楚什么会使这一切成为现实。",
	"The Kech Uul believe that when a single dar has the support of the majority, the Uul Dhakaan will reveal them—that the emperor will be proclaimed and crowned within the universal dream. But even if true, what will trigger this? The Kech Shaarat believe that power will determine the emperor. They have already absorbed the Kech Nozhii and are pressuring the Kech Ruuska, using a combination of force and fear to convince the smaller clans that the path to victory lies through uniting under a single clan. The Kech Shaarat would prefer not to kill other dar, but Ruus Dhakaan is willing to take steps to prove his power and right to lead, and Shaarat and Volaar agents have clashed in the field.": "凯奇-乌尔人相信，当一个单一的达尔得到大多数人的支持时，乌尔-达卡安将揭示他们--皇帝将在普遍的梦想中被宣布并加冕。但是，即使是真的，什么会引发这种情况？Kech Shaarat认为，权力将决定皇帝。他们已经吞并了Kech Nozhii，并正在向Kech Ruuska施压，利用武力和恐惧的结合来说服小部族，通向胜利的道路在于团结在一个部族之下。凯奇-沙拉特宁愿不杀其他达尔，但鲁斯-达卡安愿意采取措施来证明他的权力和领导权，沙拉特和沃拉尔的特工在战场上发生了冲突。",
	"Tuura Dhakaan of the Kech Volaar is following a different path as she pursues the crown. She seeks to recover lost artifacts, reminding the dar of their glory while also amassing powerful tools. There are a few she is especially keen to find: {@i Ur'taash}, the First Crown; {@i Guulen}, the Rod of Kings; and {@i Ghaal'duur}, the horn of Jhazaal Dhakaan. {@i Ur'taash} is currently in the possession of the Khesh Ghaalrac, though its authenticity is in question. The whereabouts of {@i Guulen} and {@i Ghaal'duur} remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the Kech Shaarat remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the Kech Volaar believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.": "凯奇-沃拉尔的图拉-达卡安（Tuura Dhakaan）在追求王位的过程中走的是一条不同的道路。她寻求找回丢失的文物，提醒达尔人他们的荣耀，同时也积累了强大的工具。有几个是她特别想找到的。{@i Ur'taash}，第一王冠；{@i Guulen}，国王之棒；{@i Ghaal'duur}，贾扎尔-达卡安的角。 {@i Ur'taash}目前在凯什-加拉克手中，尽管其真实性受到质疑。{@i Guulen}和{@i Ghaal'duur}的下落仍然不明。除此之外，图拉正在评估现代世界，努力看看其他人是否能成为有用的盟友。因此，尽管凯奇-沙拉特仍然相信这场冲突仅仅是基于达尔内部的主导地位，但凯奇-沃拉尔认为，对现代世界的了解对于任何长期的成功都是至关重要的。",
	"Other Keepers may devise their own paths to winning allies or the throne, and there may be Keeper clans that have yet to be revealed. For now, the Kech Dhakaan are focused on gathering information and competing among themselves. Once they unite behind a single leader, they'll have to decide how to deal with the Darguuls, the dragonmarked houses, and the Five Nations.": "其他守护者可能会设计出他们自己的道路来赢得盟友或王位，而且可能还有一些守护者的部族尚未被揭示。目前，凯奇-达卡恩人专注于收集信息和彼此之间的竞争。一旦他们团结在一个领导者的身后，他们将不得不决定如何处理达尔古尔人、龙纹屋和五国的关系。",
	"There are a few factors to consider when creating a dar character. This section examines questions about the story—What's your clan? What's your background? In addition, chapter 6 presents three new racial options for Dhakaani player characters, along with two new class archetypes associated with the Dhakaani: the Forge Adept artificer specialist, and the bardic College of the Dirge Singer.": "在创建一个Dar角色时，有几个因素需要考虑。本节研究关于故事的问题--你的部族是什么？你的背景是什么？此外，第6章为达卡尼玩家角色提供了三个新的种族选择，以及与达卡尼相关的两个新的等级原型：锻造专家（Forge Adept artificer specialist）和吟游诗人（Dirge Singer）学院。",
	"The Dhakaani are among the most effective and elite forces on Khorvaire. They possess excellent training and techniques, exceptional discipline, and masterful equipment. If you're in a campaign where characters are starting at a higher level, this isn't an issue. But what if you're starting at level 1? Dhakaani fighters are often Battle Master or Samurai fighters in {@item adamantine armor}, but you don't gain your archetype until you've been adventuring outside your kech for several levels. Here are four ideas of how to explain the inconsistency:": "达卡尼人是霍尔韦尔岛上最有效和最精锐的部队之一。他们拥有优秀的训练和技术，卓越的纪律和精湛的装备。如果你的战役中的角色是从较高的级别开始的，这就不是一个问题。但如果你是从1级开始的呢？达卡尼战士通常是战斗大师或武士的{@item adamantine armor}，但你要在你的凯奇之外冒险了几个等级才会获得你的原型。以下是如何解释这种不一致的四个想法。",
	"You don't have your traditional equipment, and it takes you a little time to get used to working with this inferior gear. You're not used to working with chaat'oor; they don't respond to your obvious cues, and their behavior constantly confuses you. The wide sky above is extremely disorienting, as you've spent much of your life underground. And worst of all is the {@i smell}. It's going to take you a few adventures to get your groove back.": "你没有你的传统装备，你需要一点时间来适应这种劣质装备的工作。你不习惯与Chaat'oor一起工作；他们对你明显的提示没有反应，他们的行为不断使你困惑。上面宽阔的天空让人极度迷失方向，因为你大部分时间都在地下生活。而最糟糕的是（%0%）。你需要经过几次冒险才能恢复你的状态。",
	"You've suffered a significant physical or psychological injury and it's going to take you a while to recover. Frankly, after everything you've been through, it's impressive that you're even capable of functioning as well as you do. Is it a mundane injury, or something more exotic? Maybe you were possessed by a quori for a few years and you're still reclaiming your identity. Or perhaps you were struck by shards of an exploding dragonshard; once you're fully recovered, might those same slivers explain some of your unusual class abilities?": "你遭受了重大的身体或心理伤害，你将需要一段时间来恢复。坦率地说，在你所经历的一切之后，你甚至能够像现在这样运作良好，这令人印象深刻。是普通的伤害，还是更奇特的东西？也许你被夸父附身了几年，你仍然在恢复你的身份。或者你被爆炸的龙石的碎片击中；一旦你完全康复，这些碎片可能会解释你一些不寻常的能力？",
	"Most clans don't want the world to know their full history and capabilities. You would rather be mistaken for a Darguul or city goblin, and are keeping a low profile. You don't have {@i adamantine armor} because it would raise questions, and you intentionally conceal your full capabilities until you trust your fellow adventurers enough to reveal your true talents.": "大多数部族不希望世人知道他们的全部历史和能力。你宁愿被误认为是达古尔人或城市妖精，并保持低调。你没有（%0%），因为这会引起质疑，你故意隐瞒你的全部能力，直到你对你的冒险者同伴有足够的信任，才会暴露你的真实才能。",
	"All of your training up to this point has set you on this path; your past life experience readied you for the new skills you're learning today. You underwent endless training while in your kech, but the pieces didn't click into place until you spent time fighting in the field. One month of adventuring didn't trump a decade of intense training, but it helped to trigger it.": "到目前为止，你所有的训练都使你走上了这条道路；你过去的生活经历为你今天所学的新技能做好了准备。你在凯奇时经历了无尽的训练，但直到你花时间在战场上战斗时，这些碎片才会被点击到位。一个月的冒险并没有胜过十年的密集训练，但它有助于触发它。",
	"Ultimately, this is all about creating a story to carry you through your first few adventures. It doesn't have to be a flawless explanation, just use your imagination and keep adventuring; soon, you'll reach level 3!": "归根结底，这都是为了创造一个故事，让你度过最初的几次冒险。它不必是一个完美无缺的解释，只要发挥你的想象力，继续冒险；很快，你就会达到第三级",
	"The dar went into hiding thousands of years ago to avoid the Kapaa'vola. They have only recently emerged from those deep vaults and reclaimed fortresses on the surface. As a dar character, you were surely born in one of the deep vaults and indoctrinated into the traditions of your clan. Consider the following questions about your character's origins:": "几千年前，为了躲避卡帕阿沃拉人，达尔人躲了起来。他们最近才从那些深藏的地窖里出来，在地表上开垦出堡垒。作为一个达尔人的角色，你肯定是出生在一个深窖里，并被灌输了你的部族的传统。请考虑以下关于你的角色起源的问题。",
	"Are you one of the Kech Volaar, or are you a hermit from the Kech Uul? Consider the list of clans from the previous section and see which works best for the story you want to tell.": "你是凯奇-沃拉尔族的一员，还是凯奇-乌尔族的隐士？考虑一下上一节的部族名单，看看哪个最适合你想讲的故事。",
	"The Dhakaani are armies, working with limited resources and absolute focus. Everyone had a function to perform, likely reflected by your background and your class. What training did you receive, and what was the purpose of that training? Were you a soldier? Were you being prepared for a military specialty (possibly reflected by your choice of archetype)? If you're a bard, were you trained to inspire troops on the battlefield or were you primarily a diplomatic envoy? You wouldn't have been pushed into a role unless you showed an aptitude for it—but did you like the role you were given, or was it a path you had to follow?": "达卡尼人是军队，以有限的资源和绝对的专注来工作。每个人都有自己的职能，可能由你的背景和你的阶级反映出来。你接受了什么训练，训练的目的是什么？你是一名士兵吗？你是否正在为军事专业做准备（可能反映在你选择的原型上）？如果你是一个吟游诗人，你接受的训练是为了在战场上激励部队，还是主要作为外交使节？除非你表现出有这方面的才能，否则你不会被推入一个角色--但你喜欢你被赋予的角色吗，或者说这是你必须遵循的道路？",
	"Despite the demands of muut and the shaping influence of the Uul Dhakaan, every dar is a unique individual with their own passions and drives. Ultimately, what do you most care about? Do you believe in the dream of the Dhakaani Empire? Do you want to become the next emperor, or do you simply want to help your people thrive? Have you rejected the bond of muut and turned your back on the empire? Or are you seeking atcha and chasing a personal story—a quest for vengeance against the defiling chaat'oor, or completing the ancient vow of an ancestor? The {@table Dhakaani Departures|ExploringEberron} table suggests some reasons a dar might leave their clan.": "尽管有muut的要求和Uul Dhakaan的塑造影响，但每一个飞镖都是一个独特的个体，有自己的激情和动力。归根结底，你最关心的是什么？你相信达卡尼帝国的梦想吗？你想成为下一个皇帝，还是你只是想帮助你的人民繁荣发展？你是否拒绝了muut的纽带，背弃了帝国？还是你在寻求atcha，追逐一个个人的故事--寻求对玷污的Chaat'oor的复仇，或者完成祖先的古老誓言？{@table Dhakaani Departures|ExploringEberron}表提出了一些达尔人可能离开他们部族的原因。",
	"Your clan and character motivations often suggest a logical choice for your background. However, certain background features don't make much sense for a Dhakaani character. Soldier is a logical background for a dar fighter, but your Military Rank feature is unrecognized outside your clan. Likewise, it makes sense for a golin'dar from the Kech Draal to have the skills of a guild artisan, but you don't have membership in any guild known in the Five Nations.": "你的部族和人物动机往往表明你的背景是一个合理的选择。然而，某些背景特征对达卡尼人来说并没有什么意义。士兵是达卡尼战士的合理背景，但你的军衔特征在你的部族之外是不被承认的。同样，对于来自Kech Draal的Golin'dar来说，拥有公会工匠的技能是有意义的，但是你在五国中没有任何公会成员资格。",
	"Your background can be used to reflect your current mission as opposed to your basic training. If you're operating undercover, you might have been taught the skills of a charlatan and set up with a solid False Identity, even if you're a plainspoken soldier at heart. As a Shaarat'khesh monk, the urchin background can reflect your training and familiarity with cities, even though you were never an abandoned child. As one of the Kech Uul, the hermit background could represent your long isolation in Jhazaal's dream—and your Discovery could be a revelation you found in the dream, whether it concerns the future of the empire or something of even greater import.": "你的背景可以用来反映你目前的任务，而不是你的基本训练。如果你在做卧底，你可能被传授了骗子的技能，并被设置了一个可靠的假身份，即使你的内心是一个朴实的士兵。作为一个Shaarat'khesh僧侣，顽童的背景可以反映出你的训练和对城市的熟悉程度，即使你从来都不是一个被抛弃的孩子。作为Kech Uul中的一员，隐士的背景可以代表你在Jhazaal的梦中长期与世隔绝，而你的发现可能是你在梦中发现的启示，无论它是关于帝国的未来还是更重要的东西。",
	"Chapter 6 includes two variant background features for use with Dhakaani characters of any background. In addition, the {@table Dhakaani Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table below suggests simple items that your character might carry from their past; your DM might let you select one of these as your trinket, or to substitute it for another small item from your background equipment. What's its story? Why do you carry it today?": "第6章包括两个可变的背景特征，可用于任何背景的达卡尼人角色。此外，下面的{@table Dhakaani Trinkets|ExploringEberron}表格建议了你的角色可能从他们的过去携带的简单物品；你的管理员可能会让你选择其中一个作为你的饰品，或者用你的背景装备中的另一个小物品代替它。它有什么故事？你今天为什么要带着它？",
	"Some classes and archetypes are common among Dhakaani dar, while others aren't as likely. Here are some suggestions of interesting characters you might play for each class.": "一些等级和原型在达卡尼人中很常见，而其他的则不太可能。这里有一些你可能扮演的每个等级的有趣角色的建议。",
	"The Kech Dhakaan call their artificers daashor. The talent of artifice is rare, and some of the greatest secrets of the past were lost to the Kapaa'vola. Dhakaani artificers typically focus on the creation of arms and armor, taking the Forge Adept archetype, provided in chapter 6, or the Battle Smith archetype. Artillerist artificers are generally only found in the Kech Hashraac. The Kech Volaar are actively seeking to unlock the arcane traditions of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and a Volaar artificer could follow any archetype with the idea that you are blazing new trails through your work. While the most legendary daashor were male ghaal'dar, there are no gender or race restrictions for this role, and golin'dar often show a talent for artifice.": "Kech Dhakaan人称他们的工匠为daashor。工匠的天赋是罕见的，过去一些最伟大的秘密被卡帕奥瓦人所遗忘。达卡尼人的工匠通常专注于武器和盔甲的制造，采用第六章提供的锻造专家原型，或战斗史密斯原型。炮兵工匠一般只在凯奇-哈什拉克发现。凯奇-沃拉尔积极寻求解开五国和龙纹屋的奥术传统，沃拉尔工匠可以遵循任何原型，认为你在通过你的工作开辟新的道路。虽然最传奇的daashor是男性ghaal'dar，但这个角色没有性别或种族限制，golin'dar经常表现出工匠的天赋。",
	"It's unusual for ghaal'dar to follow the path of the barbarian, and unheard of for golin'dar. However, the guul'dar—bugbears—are taught that their strength is the strength of the empire, and guul'dar warriors typically serve as the terrifying vanguard of a Dhakaani army. This path can be represented by the barbarian, but with an important story difference—guul'dar barbarians aren't savages, and they don't surrender to unthinking rage. Instead, guul'dar \"rage\" is a cultivated surge of adrenaline and combat awareness, not unlike the Fighting Spirit of the Samurai fighter. The Path of the Totem Warrior is the common choice for guul'dar barbarians; the choice of totem doesn't reflect a primal spirit, but rather specialized combat training. If your DM approves of this concept, you might even be able to replace the 10th-level Spirit Walker feature with the Intimidating Presence of the Berserker barbarian, as it's difficult to explain how commune with nature is tied to your military training.": "Ghaal'dar走野蛮人的道路是不寻常的，而Golin'dar则闻所未闻。然而，guul'dar-bugbears-被教导说他们的力量就是帝国的力量，guul'dar战士通常作为达卡尼军队的可怕的先锋。这条道路可以由野蛮人代表，但有一个重要的故事差异--古尔邦德野蛮人不是野蛮人，他们不会向不假思索的愤怒投降。相反，guul'dar的 \"愤怒 \"是一种经过培养的肾上腺素和战斗意识的激增，与武士的战斗精神不一样。图腾战士之路是guul'dar野蛮人的共同选择；图腾的选择并不反映一种原始精神，而是专门的战斗训练。如果你的管理员认可这个概念，你甚至可以用狂暴野蛮人的 \"威慑力 \"来取代10级的 \"精神行者 \"特征，因为很难解释与自然的交流是如何与你的军事训练相联系的。",
	"Bards play a central role in Dhakaani culture, serving as spiritual leaders and taking the role that priests fill in many other cultures. However, Dhakaani bards inspire and guide the people using tales of the past and the dream of the future, as opposed to priests seeking the favor of divine forces. Bards are also found as diplomats, civic leaders, and healers, and are the primary spellcasters in Dhakaani society. The most common bards are the {@i duur'kala} (dirge singers); as a duur'kala, you'll likely want to follow the College of the Dirge Singer included in chapter 6, or perhaps the College of Lore. The duur'kala of the Kech Nasaar may choose the College of Whispers, while the uul'kala dream singers may follow the College of Glamour. Most clans have a strongly ingrained tradition that only female ghaal'dar can serve as duur'kala. However, player characters are exceptional, and it's always possible to defy this tradition.": "吟游诗人在达卡尼文化中起着核心作用，作为精神领袖，承担着其他许多文化中祭司的角色。然而，达卡尼的吟游诗人用过去的故事和未来的梦想来激励和引导人们，而不是像祭司那样寻求神圣力量的青睐。吟游诗人也是外交官、公民领袖和治疗师，并且是达卡尼社会的主要施法者。最常见的吟游诗人是{@i duur'kala}（哀歌者）；作为一个杜尔卡拉，你很可能想跟随第六章中的哀歌者学院，或者是传说学院。Kech Nasaar的duur'kala可以选择私语学院，而uul'kala的梦想歌手可以跟随魅力学院。大多数部族都有一个根深蒂固的传统，即只有女性Ghaal'dar可以担任duur'kala。然而，玩家角色是特殊的，总是有可能违背这一传统。",
	"The Dhakaani are a martial culture, and this is their greatest strength. Dhakaani combat techniques have been honed over thousands of years, blended with the natural instincts and exceptional discipline of the Dhakaani soldier. Both the Champion and Battle Master archetypes are appropriate for all Dhakaani fighters. The Samurai archetype is primarily found with the Kech Shaarat, and is a ghaal'dar variation of the guul'dar barbarian technique. Cavaliers are tied to the tiger cavalry, and are especially common in the Kech Ruuska. Within most clans, fighter training is reserved for male ghaal'dar. However, player characters can certainly challenge this stereotype.": "达卡尼人是一种武术文化，这也是他们最大的优势。达卡尼人的战斗技巧经过数千年的磨练，与达卡尼士兵的自然本能和卓越纪律相融合。冠军和战斗大师的原型都适合于所有达卡尼战士。武士的原型主要见于Kech Shaarat，是guul'dar野蛮人技术的ghaal'dar变种。骑士与老虎骑兵联系在一起，在凯奇-鲁伊斯卡尤其常见。在大多数部族中，战士训练是为男性ghaal'dar保留的。然而，玩家角色当然可以挑战这种刻板印象。",
	"Monks are rare among the Kech Dhakaan, but not unknown. The most widespread monastic tradition is the {@i shaarat'dor} (literally, \"No Sword\") technique of the Khesh'dar. Practitioners can focus on the physical art by following the Way of the Open Hand, or they can blend this with the Shaarat'khesh arts of stealth by choosing the Way of Shadow. The Khesh'dar are exclusively golin'dar, but an exceptional character of another race might be taken in by the Silent Folk. The other established monastic tradition is that of the chot'uul (Dream Watchers). Most of the chot'uul blend mental and martial discipline, and typically follow the {@class monk||Kensei|kensei|XGE} path. Others learn how to manipulate reality as one might shape a dream; these chot'uul might follow the Way of the Four Elements. Most chot'uul are part of the reclusive Kech Uul, but most kech vaults have a small, dedicated group of dream guardians.": "僧侣在克赫达卡人中很少见，但也不是没有。最广泛的僧侣传统是克什达尔的（%0%）（字面意思是 \"无剑\"）技术。练习者可以通过遵循 \"张手之道 \"专注于身体艺术，也可以通过选择 \"阴影之道 \"将其与 \"沙拉特 \"的隐身艺术结合起来。Khesh'dar是专门的Golin'dar，但其他种族的特殊人物可能会被沉默的民俗所接纳。另一个既定的寺院传统是chot'uul（守梦人）。大多数chot'uul融合了精神和武术的纪律，并且通常遵循（1%）的路径。其他人则学习如何操纵现实，就像人们塑造一个梦一样；这些chot'uul可能遵循四元素之道。大多数chot'uul是隐居的Kech Uul的一部分，但大多数Kech vaults都有一个小的、专门的梦想守护者团体。",
	"The golin'dar of the Taarka'khesh are legendary scouts and skirmishers, the most common rangers among the Dhakaani. However, guul'dar and ghaal'dar may also train as skirmishers. Typically, the cavalry are Beast Master rangers, working with worgs or tigers. Skirmishers are often {@class ranger||Hunters|hunter} or {@class ranger||Gloom Stalkers|gloom stalker|XGE}.": "Taarka'khesh的golin'dar是传奇的侦察兵和小兵，是达卡尼人中最常见的游骑兵。然而，guul'dar和ghaal'dar也可以作为小兵训练。通常情况下，骑兵是野兽大师游骑兵，与虫族或老虎一起工作。小兵通常是（%0%）或（%1%）。",
	"Typically, the Kech Dhakaan face their foes in open combat. The arts of the rogue are the domain of the Khesh'dar goblins, who operate in the shadows of the empire. While the Shaarat'khesh are best known for their assassins, specialists can be found following almost any archetype. The Silent Folk train and can dispatch Thieves when necessary. Arcane Tricksters have adapted a form of the duur'kala's magic. And if you're using {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, Inquisitive rogues are the top spies of the Khesh'dar, while a handful of Masterminds serve as expert strategists. It's entirely possible to run a campaign around a team of Shaarat'khesh rogues with different specialties, with the Khesh'dar serving as an espionage patron. Outside of the Khesh'dar, the Kech Nasaar are the only clan that regularly trains ghaal'dar spies and assassins.": "通常情况下，凯奇-达卡人在公开战斗中面对他们的敌人。流氓的艺术是克什达尔地精的领域，他们在帝国的阴影中活动。虽然沙拉特克什人以他们的刺客而闻名，但几乎可以找到遵循任何原型的专家。沉默的民兵们在必要时可以训练和派遣盗贼。奥术师改编了duur'kala的一种魔法形式。如果你使用的是{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}，好奇的流氓是克什达尔的顶级间谍，而少数大师级人物则是专家级战略家。完全可以围绕一队具有不同专长的Shaarat'khesh流氓开展活动，由Khesh'dar作为间谍赞助人。在赫什达尔家族之外，凯奇-纳萨尔家族是唯一一个定期训练加尔达尔间谍和刺客的部族。",
	"At the height of the Empire of Dhakaan, the only common spellcasters were artificers and bards. Focused on martial discipline, the Dhakaani never unlocked the secrets of wizardry or embraced eldritch bargains—but today, the Kech Volaar are actively trying to bridge this gap in their arsenal. As a Volaar wizard, you can follow any path; the key is that you are likely a trailblazer and your accomplishments and discoveries may be very important to your people. There is no established tradition of sorcery among the Dhakaani, but the Volaar are likewise seeking out any dar who show signs of sorcerous potential. The clan has even been experimenting with warlocks, actively seeking out arcane patrons and attempted controlled studies. So as a Volaar warlock, you might be the first dar to work with this particular patron, and your superiors are eager to see how it turns out.": "在达卡尼帝国的鼎盛时期，唯一常见的施法者是工匠和吟游诗人。由于专注于武术训练，达卡尼人从未解开过巫师的秘密，也没有接受过长生不老的交易--但今天，凯奇-沃拉尔人正在积极努力弥补他们武器库中的这一空白。作为一名沃拉尔巫师，你可以走任何道路；关键是你可能是一个开拓者，你的成就和发现可能对你的人民非常重要。达卡尼人中没有既定的巫术传统，但沃拉尔人同样也在寻找任何显示出巫术潜力的达尔。该部族甚至一直在用术士做实验，积极寻找奥术赞助人并尝试进行控制性研究。因此，作为一个沃拉尔术士，你可能是第一个与这个特殊赞助人合作的达尔，而你的上级也很想看看结果如何。",
	"There are a few other options for arcane spellcasters. Depending on the path the DM decides to take with the Kech Hashraac, they could be training Evokers; like the Volaar wizards, this would reflect cutting-edge research. The Kech Nasaar have been studying necromancy for a long time and may have developed Necromancer wizards. The Nasaar are more willing than most to dally with sinister powers, and it's likewise possible that they've had a tradition of warlocks.": "对于奥术施法者还有一些其他选择。根据DM决定对凯奇-哈什拉克采取的路径，他们可能正在训练Evokers；就像沃拉尔的巫师一样，这将反映出最前沿的研究。Kech Nasaar已经研究死灵法术很长时间了，可能已经开发了死灵法师巫师。纳萨尔人比大多数人更愿意与邪恶的力量打交道，同样，他们也有可能有术士的传统。",
	"The general mindset of the dar is ill-suited to the abstract concept of faith, whether in higher powers or the world itself. They believe in the past. They believe in their leaders. But they don't believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate. It is possible to play a Dhakaani paladin who draws their divine power from their absolute devotion to the empire, or a cleric who channels power from the Uul Dhakaan. But this was always intended as an intentional gap in the capabilities of the Dhakaani: they have far greater martial skill than most of the cultures of Khorvaire, but they simply don't have access to divine magic.": "达人的普遍心态不适合抽象的信仰概念，无论是对更高的权力还是对世界本身。他们相信过去。他们相信他们的领导人。但他们不相信有控制命运的宇宙力量或预言。有可能扮演一个从对帝国的绝对奉献中汲取神力的达卡尼圣骑士，或者一个从乌尔-达卡安那里输送力量的牧师。但这一直是达卡尼人能力中的一个有意的差距：他们的武术技能远远超过霍尔韦尔的大多数文化，但他们根本无法获得神圣的魔法。",
	"Chapter 6 presents new racial traits for Dhakaani goblinoids. If you're playing a dar, your racial traits are determined by whether you're a golin'dar (goblin), ghaal'dar (hobgoblin), or guul'dar (bugbear). The terms goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear are part of the Common tongue, introduced by human settlers. While most modern goblinoids have adopted these terms themselves, the dar maintain the old ways.": "第6章介绍了达卡尼妖精的新种族特性。如果你扮演的是达尔，你的种族特征是由你是戈林达尔（地精）、加尔达尔（妖精）还是古尔达尔（虫熊）决定的。术语 \"哥布林\"、\"哥布林 \"和 \"虫子 \"是通用语的一部分，由人类定居者引入。虽然大多数现代的地精都自己采用了这些术语，但达尔人仍然保持着古老的方式。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} provided racial traits for goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, but those represent the modern goblinoids, denizens of Darguun and Droaam whose ancestors were touched by the Kapaa'vola of Dyrrn the Corruptor. While the goblinoids of the Kech Dhakaan—the {@i dar}—are physically identical to their modern cousins, there are some important differences. The dar are bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system. As one of the dar, you know your place in society and have undergone intense training to hone your natural strengths. The racial traits in chapter 6 reflect that training, but if you were raised outside of Dhakaani society, you should instead use the standard goblinoid traits.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}提供了地精、妖精和虫族的种族特征，但这些代表了现代的地精，是达尔古恩和德罗安的居民，他们的祖先被腐败者迪尔恩的卡帕'沃拉触及。虽然Kech Dhakaan--{@i dar}--的妖精族在身体上与他们的现代表亲相同，但有一些重要的区别。达尔人被穆特和阿查的哲学以及乌尔-达卡人的精神联系结合在一起。他们的生活是由无情的武术文化和僵化的种姓制度塑造的。作为达尔人中的一员，你知道自己在社会中的地位，并经历了激烈的训练，以磨练自己的天赋优势。第6章中的种族特征反映了这种训练，但如果你是在达卡尼社会之外长大的，你应该使用标准的地精族特征。",

	"Tol kollan! Some say our ancestors came from a place of ice, but we all know that's nonsense. Our ancestors were the mountains themselves. The dragons were jealous of their mighty stature, so they cast a spell that put them all to sleep, and that's where the mountains come from. We dwarves? We're the sweat from their brow. Don't believe me? Go take a look at the Face of Mror! No one could carve something like that, my friend; that's the mountain's original face. As for the others, well, they just went to sleep face down. That's the tale I had from my father, and you wouldn't want to call him a liar!": "Tol kollan! 有人说我们的祖先来自一个冰的地方，但我们都知道那是无稽之谈。我们的祖先是山脉本身。龙嫉妒他们强大的身材，所以他们施了一个咒语，让他们都睡着了，这就是山的来历。我们矮人？我们是他们额头上的汗水。不相信我？去看看莫尔的脸吧! 没有人能雕刻出这样的东西，我的朋友；那是山的原始面貌。至于其他人，嗯，他们只是脸朝下睡去了。这是我从我父亲那里得到的故事，你不会想说他是骗子吧！？",
	"Despite their long lives, the Mror dwarves are surprisingly unconcerned with recording the past. They care deeply about family. They cling to property, whether it's land or more portable possessions. They're fierce in protecting the things that they care about. But as the bard Kessler said, \"The Mror care deeply about their stories, but facts just get in the way.\" Mror talespinners have an endless supply of stories about the mighty deeds of clan heroes, but when it comes to specific dates or verifiable facts, things often get muddy. Records of debts, marriages, adoptions—these things are written down by Sivis scribes. But general history is largely trusted to the passed-down tales of the spinners, and they make history {@i interesting}. A particular story could be placed in three different centuries by three different clans, and the villain of one tale could be the hero in the neighboring holdfast.": "尽管他们的寿命很长，但Moror矮人却出奇地不关心记录过去。他们非常关心家庭。他们紧紧抓住财产，无论是土地还是更多的便携物品。他们猛烈地保护他们所关心的东西。但正如吟游诗人凯斯勒所说，\"Moror人非常关心他们的故事，但事实却阻碍了他们。梭罗族的故事家们有无穷无尽的关于氏族英雄的强大事迹的故事，但当涉及到具体日期或可核实的事实时，事情往往变得很复杂。债务、婚姻、收养的记录--这些东西都由西维斯的文士写下来。但一般的历史在很大程度上被信任于纺纱工的传世故事，他们创造了历史（%0%）。一个特定的故事可以由三个不同的部族放在三个不同的世纪里，一个故事里的恶棍可能是邻近的坚守里的英雄。",
	"Dwarves aren't native to Khorvaire, but no one knows exactly how or when they arrived. Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that's enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization—or ruins of it—waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there's no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.": "矮人并不是霍尔韦尔的原住民，但没有人确切知道他们是如何或何时到达的。大多数纺纱师都同意矮人来自冰和霜的土地，尽管从本节开头的序言中可以看出，并非所有故事都同意。虽然这对Mror来说已经足够了，但其他学者仍在争论他们可能来自哪里，以及他们是如何来到霍尔韦尔的。最流行的理论是，第一批矮人来自冰霜之城，通过凯博尔的半位面通道旅行。这个观点的支持者认为，在冰霜之城可能有一个未被发现的矮人文明--或者是它的遗迹--等待着被发现。第二个流行的理论是，矮人起源于萨洛纳的塔沙纳苔原，在人类定居者之前的几千年，他们航行到霍尔韦尔并在拉扎尔公国登陆。然而，现代Akiak矮人与Moror的文化几乎没有重叠，也没有证据表明他们曾经建造过船只。最奇特的故事是，萨洛纳和霍尔韦尔的矮人都来自里西亚，而且在里西亚的冰层深处可能还隐藏着一个伟大的文明。虽然各个部族的起源故事各不相同，但讲故事的人都同意随后出现的Moror历史的广泛时代。",
	"Wherever the dwarves came from, they sunk their roots into the soil of Khorvaire. Dhakaani dirge singers sing of battles between dwarf and dar that took place in vast halls below the earth. Dhakaani records—which are more accurate than those of the dwarves—show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn't worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call {@i Sol Udar}, the Realm Below.": "无论矮人从哪里来，他们都把根扎进了霍尔韦尔的土壤。达卡尼人的哀歌歌手唱出了矮人和达尔之间的战斗，这些战斗发生在地底巨大的大厅里。达卡尼人的记录--比矮人的记录更准确--显示达卡尼人在达卡尼帝国的黄金时代后期遇到了矮人，并将他们赶到了东部，最终达成了僵局。古代矮人缺乏威胁达卡尼的数量或资源，但他们在铁根山下建立了一条防线，并在无数次的进攻中守住了这条防线。达尔人不需要这块领土，而且随着时间的推移，他们认为征服的努力并不值得回报。这就是矮人所说的{@i Sol Udar}，下面的境界的起源。",
	"The next major era in Mror history was {@i Mallanok}, the Exile. At some point—whether years or centuries later is unclear—a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn't decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known.": "姆罗尔历史上的下一个重要时代是（%0%），流放。在某个时刻--是多年后还是几个世纪后还不清楚--一群矮人战士被放逐出地下世界，并与他们的家人和追随者一起在山上找到了新家。流放的原因取决于你问谁。莫洛伦的故事家们说，索尔乌达的国王莫洛无法决定他的13个继承人中哪个应该继承他的王位，所以他把这些英雄推到山上，以证明自己配得上他的王国。索多拉克人说，摩尔国王是个软弱的暴君，他流放这十三位英雄是因为他害怕起义。科兰伯格的梅里安-米特-达万迪教授提出了一个理论，即古代矮人可能将罪犯流放到地表世界，而不是维持监狱，而摩尔庄园的创始人是各种各样的罪犯和不受欢迎的人。真相被埋藏在几千年的重压之下，可能永远不会被发现。"
