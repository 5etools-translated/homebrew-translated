	"Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons & Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world—which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.": "Wizards of the Coast在2002年宣布了 \"幻想设定搜索\"：为《龙与地下城》征集一个新的世界。他们收到了数以千计的作品，包括我的世界--它最终成为了Eberron。我与James Wyatt、Bill Slavicsek、Christopher Perkins以及其他许多人合作，将我最初的想法发展成了今天你们所知道的Eberron。",
	"I'm extremely proud of the world we've created. However, there are elements I love that I've never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations—considering the civilizations that the merfolk, sahuagin, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down—or in some cases, cut entirely—in our original {@i Eberron Campaign Setting.} The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn't nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.": "我对我们所创造的世界感到非常自豪。然而，有一些我喜欢的元素，我从来没有机会在正式书籍中探索。在最初设计这个世界时，我把水生国家包括在内--考虑到merfolk、sahuagin和其他智能海底物种可能建立的文明。我们为Eberron开发了一个独特的平面系统，与成熟的大轮盘有着截然不同的风味。我们提出了一个自豪的地精帝国的想法，它在人类到来之前就已经统治了Khorvaire。但是任何资料书的页数都是有限的，这些想法不得不被削减--或者在某些情况下，完全被削减--在我们的原始资料中（%0%）。 这些星球是存在的，但是从来没有足够的空间来描述它们，每个星球超过一段，这还不足以理解费尔尼亚与火元素星球的不同之处，或者你如何在马巴尔设置一个冒险。从正统材料中，我们知道萨瓦金人的存在，并且在斯托姆雷奇有大使，但对他们的文明没有任何透露。",
	"From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a {@i Planes of Eberron} sourcebook, but it never came to pass—and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn't have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I've always had dreams of Droaam and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the {@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron's history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}—the official fifth-edition hardcover—the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn't enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.": "从一开始，我就希望我们能看到一本{@i Planes of Eberron}的资料书，但它从未实现--当Eberron在D&D第四和第五版中回归时，资料书需要优先考虑设定的关键基础，而没有空间去探索这些隐藏的角落。因此，虽然我脑子里一直有Droaam和平面的梦想，但Eberron是海岸奇才的知识产权，只有他们能出版新的Eberron材料。这一切在2018年发生了变化，当时海岸奇才与我合作创作了{@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}，这是一本在地下城主协会网站上发布的PDF补充材料......随着这次发布，他们在Eberron的历史上第一次让任何人通过地下城主协会为Eberron创造新内容成为可能。第二年，在创建{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}--官方的第五版精装本时，设计团队扩展了莫洛矮人的故事。但是再一次，没有足够的空间来关注他们与达尔凯尔的冲突和地下世界的神秘。",
	"That's where Wayne Chang, who works with me on the podcast {@i Manifest Zone}, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I've always wanted to explore—the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations—as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!": "这就是与我一起做播客（%0%）的韦恩-张进入画面的地方。我们一起为这本书制定了一个计划，深入探讨了许多我一直想探讨的话题--飞机、达卡尼和海底国家--以及一些更近期的发展，如Moror。于是，这本书就诞生了。",
	"As it turns out, writing a book of this size is a {@i tremendous} amount of work. Laura Hirsbrunner accomplished herculean tasks as both editor and layout designer, while Will Brolley developed immersive monsters, magic items, archetypes, and more. Since working in a vacuum is a good way to die of asphyxiation, I'm incredibly grateful to Laura, Wayne, and Will for being a constant source of feedback and inspiration.": "事实证明，写一本这么大的书是一个（%0%）的工作量。劳拉-赫斯布鲁纳作为编辑和版面设计师完成了艰巨的任务，而威尔-布罗利则开发了令人沉浸的怪物、魔法物品、原型等等。由于在真空中工作是窒息而死的好方法，我非常感谢劳拉、韦恩和威尔，他们一直是我的反馈和灵感的来源。",
	"We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova's wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens chapter 3, to Marco Bernardini's amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it's been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life. In some instances, to convey a concept to an artist, I put my own limited artistic skills to work. Below is my first draft of a sahuagin city built around one of the slumbering kar'lassa—and in chapter 4, you can see how Vincentius Matthew made sense of my sketch!": "我们还与许多艺术家合作，为这本书开发原创艺术。从卡捷琳娜-波利亚科娃（Katerina Poliakova）为蒂拉-米隆（Tira Miron）所作的精彩画像（该画为第三章的开篇），到马可-贝纳迪尼（Marco Bernardini）令人惊叹的平面图，以及每个平面的微型视图，看到世界的这些未被探索的方面变成现实，令人激动。在某些情况下，为了向艺术家传达一个概念，我把自己有限的艺术技能用于工作。下面是我对一个围绕沉睡的卡拉萨建造的萨瓦金城市的初稿--在第四章中，你可以看到文森提斯-马修是如何理解我的草图的。",
	"I'd be remiss if I didn't also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive—including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis—who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.": "如果我不把Eberron的玩家、管理人和创作者群体也叫出来，那就太失职了，他们都在保持Eberron的活力--包括我们优秀的游戏测试者！当然，还有我聪明的妻子、创作伙伴和Twogether工作室的联合创始人Jennifer Ellis--她总是愿意和我谈论卧底鲨鱼人或和平星球的旅游景点。当然，还有我聪明的妻子、创作伙伴和Twogether工作室的联合创始人Jennifer Ellis--她总是愿意和我聊一聊卧底鲨鱼人或和平位面的旅游景点。",
	"Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You'll find a few details that don't align with previous sourcebooks; it's up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there's always a third option: using {@i your} answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now—when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death—we wanted Eberron to {@i inspire} players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon—and some, you might even ignore. This presents {@i my} Eberron, but I'm always thrilled to see people making the world their own.": "在我把这本书放在你面前之前，有一个免责声明：这是我在我的桌子上运行Eberron的愿景。你会发现一些与以前的资料书不一致的细节；这取决于你决定使用哪些。但请记住，总是有第三个选择：使用（%0%）的答案。从一开始，至今已近二十年了--当我们选择不介绍哀伤的原因或揭示死亡印记的力量时，我们就希望Eberron能够（%1%）玩家和地下城主，而不是限制他们。这是一本供你借鉴的书--有些你甚至可以忽略不计。这本书介绍了{@i my}Eberron，但我总是很高兴看到人们把这个世界变成自己的世界。",
	"And now—Eberron awaits!": "而现在--Eberron在等待着!",
	"\"You think it's safe?\" The crackling arcs of energy wreathing the elemental engine cast a pale blue light across the platform. Dela smiled back at him. \"It's perfectly safe, Rev. Haven't you been on a lightning rail before? What you see there is just a secondary manifestation—\"": "\"你认为这很安全吗？\" 环绕着元素引擎的噼里啪啦的能量弧线在平台上投下淡淡的蓝光。德拉回头对他笑了笑。\"这是完全安全的，牧师，你以前没坐过闪电轨道吗？你在那里看到的只是一个次要的表现--\"",
	"\"Not that.\" The warforged soldier's voice was deep and solemn, like a heavy drum. \"This task. The mountains. The island. The journey into dreams. Rusty says it's impossible.\"": "\"不是这样的。\" 战神士兵的声音低沉而庄重，像一面沉重的鼓。\"这个任务。这座山。这座岛。进入梦境的旅程。拉斯蒂说这是不可能的。\"",
	"\"Just because something's never been done doesn't mean it's impossible. It just means it's a problem I've never tried to solve. But safe? No, it's definitely not safe.\" She reached up, resting her hand on his steel shoulder. \"That's why I'm bringing you.\"": "\"某件事情从未被做过并不意味着它不可能。它只是意味着这是一个我从未试图解决的问题。但是安全吗？不，这绝对不安全。\" 她伸手，把她的手搁在他的钢肩上。\"这就是为什么我把你带来。\"",

	"Eberron is a world shaped by the rise and fall of great ancient civilizations. It's a setting scarred by the impact of the Last War and defined by the ongoing evolution of magic and artifice. What were the weapons of the Last War? How is magic a part of everyday life in the Five Nations? What events of the distant past could play a role in the present day?": "Eberron是一个由伟大的古代文明的兴衰塑造的世界。它是一个被最后一次战争的影响弄得伤痕累累的环境，并被不断进化的魔法和人工制品所定义。最后一次战争的武器是什么？魔法是如何成为五国日常生活的一部分的？遥远的过去有哪些事件会对今天产生影响？",
	"The present is shaped by the past. The shadow of the Last War hangs over Khorvaire, setting the stage for conflicts ahead. But Khorvaire also bears the marks of struggles far more ancient. The goblins in Sharn's slums are descended from the founders of a mighty empire, and they rightfully feel that humanity stole their homeland. The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters. The Church of the Silver Flame was founded at the end of the third century, but it's simply the latest manifestation of a conflict that began at the dawn of time—a battle still fought in the shadows by the fiendish Lords of Dust and the dragons of the Chamber.": "现在是由过去塑造的。最后一次战争的阴影笼罩着霍尔韦尔，为未来的冲突埋下伏笔。但霍尔韦尔也有更古老的斗争的痕迹。沙恩贫民区的地精是一个强大帝国的创始人的后代，他们有理由认为人类偷走了他们的家园。九世纪初对狼人的清洗使人类和变异者之间的关系变得紧张。银色火焰教会成立于第三世纪末，但它只是一场始于时间之初的冲突的最新表现，这场战斗仍然由邪恶的尘埃领主和商会的龙在阴影中进行。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} touches briefly on Eberron's history, but a detailed accounting of the world's hundred-thousand-year recorded history could easily fill an entire book.

	"Before history began, legend holds...": "在历史开始之前，传说中...",
	"The three Progenitor dragons created the planes.": "三条始祖龙创造了这些平面。",
	"In a cosmic quarrel, Khyber destroyed Siberys. Eberron then bound Khyber within her own body, forming the world.": "在一次宇宙争吵中，凯贝尔摧毁了西伯利亚。艾伯伦随后将凯伯捆绑在自己的身体里，形成了这个世界。",
	"No one knows what came before the world's creation. In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation—that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.": "没有人知道在这个世界被创造之前发生了什么。在一些说法中，Xoriat曾经包含了所有的东西；一些 \"下龙 \"的崇拜者断言，daelkyr只是在试图恢复现实的原始平衡。其他人则认为，在创造之前什么都没有--始祖是从更高层次的现实中降生的，也就是位于多鲁尔之上和之外的那个不可知的领域。但几乎所有的文化都同意将现实带入的力量。",
	"Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world.": "三个生命将各个平面编织起来，然后用这些概念作为物质世界的基础。巨人断言这三个生命是某种形式的泰坦，但常见的解释是祖巫的解释：三个巨大的宇宙龙。不管怎么说，这个故事以冲突结束。在完成物质界的创造后，凯伯毫无征兆地出手，将西伯利亚斯撕碎，留下他的残余物在西伯利亚斯的金环中漂流到世界各地。",
	"Knowing she couldn't defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below.": "Eberron知道自己无法战胜Khyber，便将她盘绕起来，成为世界本身，并将Khyber束缚在一个活生生的监狱中，一直保持到今天。因此，我们所知道的世界是由西伯利亚、艾伯伦和凯博尔的交集构成的：上面的龙，中间的龙，下面的龙。",
	"While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don't worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she's the source of all life, but doesn't actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.": "虽然这个故事家喻户晓，但有些传统赋予它更多的意义。在五族中，大多数人认为它是对天空、大地和潜伏在下面的怪物的简单比喻。即使那些认为它是字面意义上的真理的人（如许多德鲁伊），也不会像崇拜主宰者那样崇拜祖先。西伯丽丝已经死了，而Eberron是世界本身；她是所有生命的源头，但并不以任何方式积极干预。然而，少数邪教（特别是在霍尔韦尔的哥布林中）确实直接崇拜始祖。",
	"Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there {@i is} a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest.": "无论是字面上的真相还是隐喻，这些强大的祖先之战都发生在遥远的过去。它对现在的影响最重要的是：有（%0%）个现在。由于这一创造行为带来了万物的存在，霍尔韦尔的学者们还没有找到任何关于这个时间之前的遗迹或记录。如果一个故事涉及到一个来自更深的过去的物体，它很可能拥有巨大的力量，并具有巨大的学术兴趣。",
	"During the Age of Demons, myths tell us...": "在恶魔的时代，神话告诉我们...",

	"Champions, later known as the Sovereign Hosts, fought the overlords with an alliance of dragons and couatl.": "冠军们，后来被称为 \"主宰者\"，与龙和库拉特的联盟一起与霸主作战。",
	"The sacrifice of the couatl bound the overlords with a force that formed the silver Flame.": "库阿特尔的牺牲用一种形成银色火焰的力量束缚了霸主们。",
	"According to the Progenitor myth, Eberron became the world and all natural creatures are her children. But in the first days of the world, the children of Khyber—fiends, aberrations, and other monsters—rose up from the darkness and claimed dominion over the world. The greatest among these were the overlords, immortal archfiends embodying the evils that plague mortals. Each overlord shaped the world to match their whims, and no civilization could challenge them. It was a time of chaos that lasted for untold millennia.": "根据始祖神话，Eberron成为了世界，所有自然生物都是她的孩子。但在世界诞生的最初几天，开伯尔的孩子们--恶魔、畸形人和其他怪物--从黑暗中崛起，并要求统治这个世界。其中最伟大的是霸主，不朽的大恶魔，体现了困扰凡人的邪恶。每个霸主都按照自己的想法来塑造世界，没有任何文明可以挑战他们。那是一个持续了数千年的混乱时期。",
	"The Age of Demons came to an end after an extended war between the overlords and a legendary group of champions—now known as the Sovereign Host. Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods—or perhaps something else entirely—these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn't be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords. Even today, the overlords remain bound and the world protected from immense evil by this force, now known as the Silver Flame.": "恶魔时代在霸主和一群传奇的冠军--现在被称为 \"主宰者\"--之间的长期战争后结束了。这些叛乱者被一些人认为是龙，被另一些人认为是神，或者可能是其他完全不同的东西，他们组建了一支龙的军队，与couatl结盟，据说是体现了Siberys最后的光芒的本地天人。由于不朽的霸主无法被摧毁，无数的库亚特人牺牲了自己，他们的精神结合成一个纯粹的天体能量的监狱，可以约束霸主。即使在今天，这些霸主仍然被束缚着，世界也被这股力量保护着，免遭巨大的邪恶，现在被称为银色火焰。",
	"The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It's commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons—for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It's up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.": "恶魔时代在十万年前结束，远远早于今天任何文明的建立。但这个时代在神话中挥之不去，并继续影响着现代生活。人们普遍认为，主宰的神灵在这一时期行走于世界，并与霸主进行了肉搏战。然而，许多学者断言，这些神话实际上是基于英雄的龙的事迹--例如，主权者奥里昂的神话可能是受一条名叫奥里隆斯特里克斯的龙的事迹启发。真相由DM决定，但冒险者有可能找到与这个时代的主权者有关的地方或遗物。你可能会找到多尔-阿拉赫在与守门人卡塔什卡战斗时使用的长矛，或者她和多尔-多恩为嘲笑者的背叛而剥皮的地方。无论与神还是龙有关，这些遗址和遗迹仍然拥有力量。",
	"While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison... and there's no official list of all of the overlords or where they are bound. So if a story calls for a region where the restless dead rise and prey on the living, this could be the prison of Katashka the Gatekeeper. If a region is suddenly overcome by ice and snow, perhaps the shard-prison of Dral Khatuur has been brought there.": "虽然霸主们可能已经被打败，但他们无法被摧毁。每个霸主都被束缚在开伯尔龙石中，被银色火焰的力量关在监狱里。虽然被束缚，但霸主可以影响其监狱周围地区的世界......而且没有所有霸主的官方名单，也没有他们被束缚的地方。因此，如果一个故事要求一个地区的不安分的死人复活并捕食活人，这可能是守门人卡塔什卡的监狱。如果一个地区突然被冰雪覆盖，也许德拉-卡图尔的碎片监狱就被带到了那里。",
	"Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. As they reach higher levels, adventurers might even become active participants in this struggle instead of mere pawns. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.": "每位霸主只有在 \"龙族预言 \"的某个特定段落实现后才能被释放。被称为 \"尘埃领主 \"的恶魔们致力于发现和实施这些预言，而商会的龙则试图阻止他们。双方都经常利用凡人作为棋子，所以冒险者很容易发现自己被卷入了这些计划。当他们达到更高的水平时，冒险者甚至可能成为这场斗争的积极参与者，而不是单纯的棋子。虽然很少有凡人意识到这一点，但这是一场决定世界命运的持续冷战。",
	"Dungeons from the Age of Demons are rare, few surviving the passage of time. Any remaining sites would be infused with fiendish or celestial power. A vault created by the couatl could hold a deadly artifact tied to an overlord. An obsidian fortress might be imbued with Rak Tulkhesh's power, and people who settle there are consumed by homicidal rage. One of the best documented sites is Ashtakala, an ancient city in the heart of the Demon Wastes said to be the sanctuary of the Lords of Dust.": "恶魔时代的地下城是罕见的，很少有人能在时间的流逝中幸存下来。任何剩余的地点都会被注入恶魔或天体的力量。由库阿特尔创造的金库可能存放着与一个霸主有关的致命的神器。一个黑曜石堡垒可能被注入了拉克-图尔克什的力量，在那里定居的人被杀人的愤怒所吞噬。有记载的最佳地点之一是阿什塔卡拉，这是位于恶魔荒原中心的一座古城，据说是尘土领主的圣地。",

	"In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen'drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons' increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber's power (see chapter 3), the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.": "在恶魔时代之后，龙是Eberron中最强大的力量。一些龙帮助指导较小的生物，包括Xen'drik的巨人，使其掌握奥术。随着龙的统治力不断增强，开伯尔之女的力量激增（见第3章），龙被迫撤退到阿贡尼森的隔离区。他们至今仍留在那里，希望能阻止她的力量进一步增强。",
	"Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen'drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it's thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul'sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it's not known whether the Cul'sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.": "Xen'drik上出现了多个巨人国家。苏拉特联盟擅长元素束缚和魔法培育。他们创造了乌鸦作为活的武器来对付叛乱的精灵，人们认为火巨人是苏拉特的残余。十一国集团是一个由11个城邦组成的联盟，每个城邦都由一个强大的帝王法师领导。他们多样化的文化重视内部和外部的竞争，认为这推动了进化。Cul's Dominion由强大的帝王法师统治，试图主宰所有的现实。他们探索平面和世界；不知道Cul'sir是否攻击了Dal Quor，也不知道当时的Quori是否试图入侵Eberron，但这两个势力打了一场持久战。巨人用灾难性的魔法摧毁了埃伯龙的一颗卫星，破坏了达尔-库尔和世界之间的平面联系，从而结束了这场冲突。从那时起，科里人就无法亲自前往艾伯伦，也不再有任何通往达尔-库尔的显露区。",
	"These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul'sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the elves—both those oppressed by the Cul'sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul'sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen'drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler's Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du'rashka Tul—\"the madness of crowds\"—causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.": "这些行动对巨人文明产生了破坏性的影响。在这场动乱中，许多Cul's sir的臣民利用这个机会进行反抗，但最大的起义是精灵--既包括那些被Cul's sir压迫的精灵，也包括那些从未被巨人征服过的精灵战士。当Cul's sir威胁要再次动用他们最危险的魔法来摧毁精灵时，龙从Argonnessen强势崛起了。他们彻底摧毁了Xen'drik的文明，包括巨人和其他文明，然后对这片土地下了现代人无法理解的诅咒。时至今日，这片土地上的祸害阻止了任何先进文明的再次崛起。旅行者的诅咒扭曲了空间，使Xen'drik的旅行变得不可靠。被称为Du'rashka Tul的诅咒--\"人群的疯狂\"--导致过于先进或广泛的文明崩塌，陷入疯狂。德拉康诅咒被认为是巨人从强大的泰坦演变为山丘巨人和今天已知的其他巨人的原因。这些龙卷风诅咒的全部范围尚不清楚，但其影响是明确无误的。",
	"The curses laid on Xen'drik mean that the entire continent is in essence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped or explored. The giants mastered secrets of arcane magic as yet unmatched by humanity or even by the elves, and as such Xen'drik is a source for powerful artifacts, spells, and eldritch machines. Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to recover a Cul'sir artifact could easily drive an adventure, and Sulat weapons could shift the balance of power in Khorvaire if they fell into the wrong hands.": "对Xen'drik的诅咒意味着整个大陆在本质上是一个巨大的地牢，一个永远无法被完全映射或探索的土地。巨人掌握了人类甚至精灵都无法比拟的奥术秘密，因此Xen'drik是强大的神器、法术和超自然机器的来源。元素飞艇和战争锻造者的发展都是受到与古代巨人有关的发现的启发，而新的发现也可能同样重要。寻找库尔先生神器的竞赛很容易推动一场冒险，而苏拉特武器如果落入坏人之手，就会改变霍尔韦尔的权力平衡。",
	"While Xen'drik's many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn't stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach lies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to be explored.": "虽然Xen'drik的许多诅咒使人们几乎不可能在这片土地上殖民，但这并不妨碍人们的尝试！Stormreach城是一个位于未知边缘的前哨站。暴风城是未知世界边缘的前哨，是强大的神器、未知的魔法和奇异的生物流向霍尔韦尔的门户。在Stormreach之外，是一个充满废墟和奇迹的耐人寻味的大陆，等待人们去探索。",
	"Though the Age of Giants has faded into legend, consider these ideas how your character might encounter its echoes today:": "虽然巨人时代已经消逝在传说中，但考虑这些想法，你的角色今天可能会遇到它的回声。",
	"As an elf, you're haunted by trance-visions of an ancient city of your distant ancestors hidden somewhere in trackless Xen'drik. What is the force that's calling you there?": "作为一个精灵，你被恍惚的幻象所困扰，你遥远的祖先的古城隐藏在无轨的Xen'drik的某个地方。是什么力量在召唤你去那里？",
	"As an artificer, you're on the edge of an arcane breakthrough, but the final piece of the puzzle is tied to the work of the giants. You'll need to search through their ruins for clues.": "作为一名工匠，你正处在一个奥秘突破的边缘，但拼图的最后一块与巨人的工作有关。你需要在他们的废墟中寻找线索。",
	"You possess a trinket from Xen'drik—a prospector's map? an ancient key?—tied to an ancient Sulat vault.": "你拥有一个来自Xen'drik的饰品--一个探矿者的地图？ 一把古老的钥匙？--系在一个古老的Sulat金库上。",

	"Goblins and orcs dominated Khorvaire, while dwarves, dragonborn, gnomes, and halflings had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.": "地精和兽人主宰着霍尔韦尔，而矮人、龙裔、地精和半身人在大陆上的存在和影响较小。",
	"The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan flourished for ten thousand years, then was destroyed when the daelkyr invaded the Material Plane. Thought he daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.": "达卡安的妖精帝国繁荣了一万年，然后在达尔基尔人入侵物质世界时被摧毁。以为达尔基尔被打败了，但他们的疯狂种子摧毁了地精文明。",
	"The daelkyr conflict destroyed the dwarven Realm Below.": "daelkyr冲突摧毁了下面的矮人境界。",
	"After Xen'drik was shattered by the dragons, they remained isolated in Argonnessen. Human civilization was slowly taking shape on Sarlona, but the most dynamic cultures of this period were forming on and around the continent of Khorvaire. The elves founded a new homeland on Aerenal—\"Aeren's rest\" in Elvish—instituting the Undying Court and establishing the cultures that would become the Aereni and the Tairnadal. On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire. The Dhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes—the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with the dragonborn of what's now Q'barra, the dwarves of the Realm Below, and Tairnadal explorers, but none could stop the advance of Dhakaan.": "在Xen'drik被龙击碎后，他们仍然被隔离在Argonnessen。人类文明在萨洛纳慢慢形成，但这一时期最有活力的文化是在霍尔韦尔大陆及其周围形成的。精灵们在艾瑞纳（Aerenal）--埃尔维什语中的 \"艾瑞纳的休息\"--建立了不朽的法庭，并建立了后来成为艾瑞纳和泰尔纳达尔的文化。在霍尔韦尔，地精族崛起，在大约16000年前建立了达卡安帝国。在接下来的一万年里，它扩张到统治了整个霍尔韦尔中部。达卡尼人慢慢地把他们所有的竞争者都赶到了边缘地带--山区、荒野、大路。他们与现在Q'barra的龙裔、下层世界的矮人和Tairnadal探险家发生冲突，但没有人能够阻止达卡尼的前进。",
	"However, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations through portals from Xoriat, the Empire of Dhakaan was shattered—along with the Realm Below, the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves (see chapter 4).": "然而，当戴尔基尔（daelkyr）率领反常者的军队通过Xoriat的传送门时，达卡安帝国被粉碎了--同时被粉碎的还有地下世界，即矮人的巨大地下文明（见第四章）。",
	"Though this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani champions and Gatekeeper druids sealed the daelkyr in Khyber, the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to creating monsters such as dolgaunts and doppelgangers, the daelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness. One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids' shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization (see chapter 4). Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of Khorvaire were ruins and chaos.": "虽然这场激烈的冲突在达卡尼冠军和守门人德鲁伊将戴尔克尔封印在开伯尔时结束了，但造成的伤害是无法弥补的。除了创造出多尔衮和二重身等怪物外，达尔凯尔还释放出更多微妙的诅咒和疯狂的菌种。其中之一侵蚀了与地精族的共同梦想的联系，而这个梦想将达卡尼文明团结在一起（见第4章）。在几代人的时间里，这个古老的帝国崩溃了，陷入了内战。邪教和残忍在地精族中蔓延，很快，霍尔韦尔的表面只剩下了废墟和混乱。",
	"Dhakaani ruins are scattered across Khorvaire. Most major cities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations, and there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have been largely ignored by the human inhabitants. A Dhakaani ruin could be viewed as a simple dungeon, but these are the remnants of a proud civilization; what an adventurer sees merely as a useful magical weapon could be an important cultural relic of the goblins. While the Empire wasn't as advanced as the civilizations of giants that came before, the daashor artificers of Dhakaan—discussed in depth in chapter 4—produced remarkable artifacts and were master weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of adamantine and other exotic alloys.": "达卡尼废墟散布在霍尔韦尔。现代的大多数主要城市都建立在达卡尼人的基础上，在他们下面有一些隧道和战壕，但基本上被人类居民忽视了。达卡尼人的废墟可以被看作是一个简单的地牢，但这些都是一个骄傲的文明的遗迹；一个冒险家仅仅看作是有用的魔法武器的东西，可能是地精的重要文化遗物。虽然帝国并不像之前的巨人文明那样先进，但达卡安的daashor工匠--在第四章中深入讨论过--生产出了非凡的工艺品，并且是对金刚砂和其他异域合金有着卓越理解的武器制造大师。",
	"This is the story that underlies both the rise of Darguun and the recent emergence of the Heirs of Dhakaan. Before the arrival of humanity, goblins and orcs shaped the destiny of the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim that ancient glory.": "这就是达尔古恩的崛起和最近达卡安继承人的出现所依据的故事。在人类到来之前，地精和兽人塑造了这片大陆的命运，有许多人渴望重新获得那份古老的荣耀。",
	"Though it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the daelkyr incursion is still felt across Khorvaire. The cults of the Dragon Below and the Gatekeeper druids are active legacies of this conflict. As described in chapter 4, the Mror dwarves are venturing into the ruined Realm Below and recovering daelkyr symbionts and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed—and scheming—in Khyber, adventurers could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.": "虽然它发生在几千年前，但整个霍尔韦尔仍能感受到戴尔基尔入侵的影响。下面的龙的崇拜和守门人德鲁伊是这场冲突的积极遗留物。正如第四章所描述的，摩尔矮人正在冒险进入破败的下层世界，并恢复了daelkyr共生体和其他遗物。当达尔凯尔人仍然被封印在开伯尔，并且在谋划着什么的时候，冒险者们可能会偶然发现古代的防御工事、有机的达尔凯尔金库，或者这场被遗忘的战争的其他遗迹。",
	"Whether your character is a goblinoid, orc, or a more recent inhabitant of these lands, consider these ways the Age of Monsters might inform your past and your future:": "无论你的角色是哥布林人、兽人，还是这些土地上的新近居民，都要考虑怪物时代可能会影响你的过去和未来的方式。",
	"As a character from the Shadow Marches, you carry an heirloom amulet you've sworn to keep safe. Have you learned that it's part of the wards that bind the daelkyr in Khyber—and that cultists bound to a particular daelkyr will be hunting you, trying to destroy the amulet?": "作为一个来自阴影地带的角色，你带着一个你发誓要保护的传家宝护身符。你是否了解到这是束缚开伯尔的守护神的一部分--被某一特定守护神束缚的邪教徒将追杀你，试图摧毁这枚护身符？",
	"You're obsessed with the early history of Khorvaire and are always searching for leads on ancient Dhakaani ruins and daelkyr relics. Are you a city goblin or Tharashk half-orc searching for your roots? Or just a scholar of another race that's fascinated with the period?": "你对霍尔韦尔的早期历史非常着迷，总是在寻找关于古代达卡尼遗迹和戴尔基尔遗物的线索。你是一个城市地精或塔拉什克半兽人，正在寻找你的根源？或者只是一个对这个时期着迷的其他种族的学者？",
	"As a Dhakaani goblinoid (see chapter 4) you are an advance scout for a Dhakaani {@i kech}. Were you sent to reclaim lost Dhakaani artifacts, or are you studying the people of the surface, identifying weaknesses, and considering if any are worthy allies?": "作为一个达卡尼妖精（见第四章），你是达卡尼人（%0%）的先遣侦察员。你是被派去夺回丢失的达卡尼文物，还是在研究地表的人们，找出他们的弱点，并考虑是否有值得信赖的盟友？",
	"You possess a Dhakaani weapon, claimed by your ancestor and handed down through your family. There is power in the blade, but it only flows through a bearer when they prove worthy... and you haven't. Can you master the blade?

	"Scholars at Morgrave University call the last five thousand years the Age of Humanity, contending that its defining trait is the rise of human civilization and its spread from Sarlona to Khorvaire. The gnome sages of the Library of Korranberg call it the Dragonmarked Age, asserting that the appearance of the dragonmarks and the achievements of the dragonmarked houses are more significant in the grand sweep of history than mere human achievements. Most people dodge this debate by simply referring to it as the modern age.": "莫格雷夫大学的学者们将过去的五千年称为人类时代，认为它的决定性特征是人类文明的崛起及其从萨尔罗纳到科尔维尔的传播。科兰伯格图书馆的地精贤者称其为龙纹时代，断言龙纹的出现和龙纹家族的成就在历史的长河中比单纯的人类成就更为重要。大多数人通过简单地将其称为现代时代来回避这场辩论。",

	"The first aberrant dragonmarks appeared soon after the true dragonmarks. At the time the dragonmarked houses joined together as the Twelve, aberrant marks were spread across the Five Nations. Some members of the Twelve truly saw aberrant marks as abominations; others considered them a convenient scapegoat to unite the houses and strengthen their position. House propaganda and whispering campaigns amplified the perception of aberrant marks as dangerous and uncontrollable. Fear progressed to violence, and in time, to squads of Deneith soldiers, Vadalis trackers, and Medani inquisitors \"protecting communities from the aberrant threat.\"": "第一批反常的龙纹在真正的龙纹之后不久出现。在有龙纹的家族联合起来成为十二家族的时候，反常的龙纹已经遍布五国。十二家族的一些成员真的把异常龙纹视为可憎的东西；其他人则认为它们是一个方便的替罪羊，可以团结各家族并加强其地位。家族的宣传和窃窃私语活动扩大了人们对反常印记的看法，认为它们是危险和不可控制的。恐惧发展为暴力，并在一段时间内发展为由迪尼斯士兵、瓦达利斯追踪者和梅达尼审问者组成的小队，\"保护社区免受反常者的威胁\"。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks of the time were generally more powerful and dangerous than those of today. The Twelve took true stories of innocents harmed by uncontrolled marks and amplified them—superstition and fear did the rest. The title \"War of the Mark\" implies two even sides, but this was more of a purge than a struggle of equals. Toward the end, however, a few aberrant-marked champions rallied others and challenged the houses. The most infamous were Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague, who seized Sharn and declared it a haven for those with aberrant marks. Eventually, the forces of the Twelve laid siege to the city. When Tarkanan and the Lady saw victory was impossible, they unleashed the full power of their marks. Tarkanan's mark gave him power over the earth, and he shattered the towers. The Lady of the Plague called vermin up from the depths and spread vile diseases in the ruins. Both the aberrants sheltering in the city and the armies attacking it perished, and Sharn remained in ruins for centuries before Galifar I finally reclaimed it.": "当时的反常龙印通常比今天的龙印更加强大和危险。十二人组采用了被不受控制的龙印伤害的无辜者的真实故事，并将其放大--其余的都是迷信和恐惧。印记战争 \"的标题意味着双方势均力敌，但这更像是一场清洗，而不是一场平等的斗争。然而，到了最后，一些拥有反常印记的冠军召集了其他人，向各家族发起挑战。最臭名昭著的是哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）和瘟疫女士，他们占领了沙恩，并宣布它是那些拥有反常标记的人的避难所。最终，十二门派的军队围攻了这座城市。当塔卡南和夫人看到胜利是不可能的，他们释放了他们印记的全部力量。塔卡南的印记给了他对大地的力量，他击碎了塔楼。瘟疫女士将害虫从深处召唤出来，在废墟中传播卑鄙的疾病。躲在城市里的异教徒和攻击它的军队都死了，在加利法尔一世最终夺回它之前，沙恩在废墟中停留了几个世纪。",
	"Aberrant marks were almost completely eradicated during the War of the Mark. When they reappeared in later centuries, they were far weaker than Halas Tarkanan's earth-shaking power, but fear and prejudice linger. Over the last century, with no explanation, aberrant marks have begun manifesting with greater frequency and power. The criminal organization known as House Tarkanan has begun organizing and training those with aberrant marks, fearing another purge could lie ahead.": "在印记战争期间，异端印记几乎被完全根除。当它们在后来的几个世纪中重新出现时，它们远远弱于哈拉斯-塔卡南撼动地球的力量，但恐惧和偏见仍然存在。在过去的一个世纪里，在没有任何解释的情况下，反常的印记开始以更高的频率和力量显现出来。被称为塔卡南家族的犯罪组织已经开始组织和训练那些拥有反常印记的人，担心另一场清洗可能就在眼前。",
	"Aberrant dragonmarks don't seem to deserve the prejudice leveled against them. They aren't that powerful, and player characters rarely lose control of their marks. But everyone knows that Halas Tarkanan shattered the towers of Sharn, the Lady of the Plague destroyed her village as a child, and the Dreambreaker was a monster who drove people mad as amusement. As a character with an aberrant mark, you bear the burden of centuries of superstition, stories encouraged and exaggerated by the Twelve. And the leaders of House Tarkanan point to the War of the Mark as a possible path the future might take. If you have an aberrant mark, will you join House Tarkanan and prepare to fight the Twelve? Or will you try to change public perception and fight the fears?": "异教徒的龙印似乎并不值得对它们的偏见。它们并不那么强大，而且玩家角色很少会失去对其标记的控制。但是每个人都知道哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）击碎了沙恩的塔楼，瘟疫女士在孩童时期就摧毁了她的村庄，而破梦者是一个把人逼疯的怪物，作为娱乐。作为一个拥有反常印记的角色，你背负着几个世纪以来的迷信，这些故事被十二门徒鼓励和夸大了。而塔卡南家族的领导人则指出，印记战争是未来可能采取的道路。如果你有一个反常的标记，你会加入塔卡南家族并准备与十二门徒作战吗？或者你会尝试改变公众的看法，与恐惧作斗争？",
	"Karrn the Conqueror failed to unite Khorvaire by force, but centuries later, his descendant Galifar Wynarn succeeded through might and clever diplomacy. Galifar didn't just want power—he wanted to build a better world, and on many levels, he succeeded. He abolished slavery and instituted laws that promised justice for all. Over time, the kingdom would promote public education and the rise of the merchant class. It can be argued that Galifar stumbled in giving the dragonmarked houses too much economic power; while the Korth Edicts prevent dragonmarked heirs from holding lands or titles, they also lay the foundation for the near-monopolies the houses hold today.": "征服者卡恩没能用武力统一霍尔韦尔，但几个世纪后，他的后裔加利法尔-维纳恩通过力量和聪明的外交手段获得了成功。加利法尔不仅仅想要权力，他还想建立一个更好的世界，在很多方面他都成功了。他废除了奴隶制，并制定了法律，承诺为所有人提供公正。随着时间的推移，这个王国将促进公共教育和商人阶层的崛起。可以说，加利法尔在给予龙纹家族太多的经济权力方面是失策的；虽然科思法令阻止了龙纹家族的继承人持有土地或头衔，但它们也为龙纹家族今天的近乎垄断奠定了基础。",
	"Galifar can also be faulted for his precarious system of succession. By this tradition, the children of the reigning monarch served as governors of the five provinces, with the eldest governing Cyre. The previous governors served as regents until an heir came of age, at which point they were expected to step aside. This system led to multiple rebellions and attempted secessions over the course of history, the Last War simply the largest and last of them.": "加利法尔也因其不稳定的继承制度而受到指责。根据这一传统，在位君主的子女担任五个省的总督，其中最年长的人负责管理赛尔。前任总督担任摄政者，直到继承人成年，这时他们就应该靠边站。这种制度在历史上导致了多次叛乱和分裂企图，最后一次战争只是其中最大和最后的一次。",
	"A century of brutal war has divided the people of the Five Nations, but they are still united by a host of common laws and customs—the legacy of Galifar. And there are still many who look back to Galifar as a golden age, who would be willing to go to war again for a chance to return to that supposed paradise.": "一个世纪的残酷战争分裂了五国人民，但他们仍然被一系列共同的法律和习俗所团结--加利法尔的遗产。仍有许多人将加利法尔视为黄金时代，他们愿意再次参战，以获得回到那个所谓的天堂的机会。",
	"Many of the institutions that define the nations—the Arcane Congress, the King's Citadel, Rekkenmark Academy—were originally dedicated to the common good of Galifar. Members of the longer-lived races, such as elves and dwarves, likely trained at these institutions, regardless of the nations they serve today.": "许多定义国家的机构--奥术大会、国王城堡、雷肯马克学院--最初都是为了加利法尔的共同利益。寿命较长的种族的成员，如精灵和矮人，很可能在这些机构中接受过训练，无论他们今天服务于哪个国家。",
	"Before the ninth century, lycanthropy was largely just a fearsome legend. Lycanthropes were known in the wilds of Khorvaire, but few people had ever seen one; most commoners thought lycanthropes and shifters were the same thing. Early in the ninth century, something changed—the curse of lycanthropy became more virulent, and its victims were driven to ever more extreme behavior. Werewolf attacks and wererat infestations became an increasing problem in western Aundair, and by 830 YK, some feared that an apocalyptic threat was brewing in the Towering Wood—that any day a horde of lycanthropes could sweep across the land and destroy all civilization.": "在第九世纪之前，狼人症基本上只是一个可怕的传说。狼人在Khorvaire的荒野中是众所周知的，但很少有人见过；大多数平民认为狼人和变身者是一回事。在第九世纪初，一些事情发生了变化--狼人的诅咒变得更加剧烈，它的受害者被驱赶到更加极端的行为。狼人的攻击和狼人的侵扰在昂代尔西部成为一个日益严重的问题，到公元830年，一些人担心在高耸的森林中正在酝酿一个世界末日的威胁--任何一天，狼人的部落都可能横扫这片土地并摧毁所有文明。",
	"In 832 YK, Keeper of the Flame Jolan Sol declared that lycanthropy corrupted the soul itself and must be completely eliminated. An army of templars was dispatched to Aundair, and servants of the Flame across Khorvaire were ordered to be vigilant and root out lycanthropes in hiding. And so they did.": "在公元832年，火焰守护者乔兰-索尔宣布，狼人症会腐蚀灵魂本身，必须彻底消除。一支圣殿骑士的军队被派往昂代尔，火焰的仆人们被命令在整个霍尔韦尔保持警惕，铲除隐藏的狼人。他们就这样做了。",
	"The Silver Crusade lasted for nearly fifty years. The first two decades were a brutal, bloody campaign. The lycanthropes were massing in great numbers on the edge of the Towering Wood (now part of the Eldeen Reaches), driven by some unknown evil; most sages believe it was an overlord on the verge of breaking its bonds. The templars were outmatched. The lycanthropes were cunning and could quickly replenish their numbers, and they intentionally stirred up conflict between templars and shifters. But after decades of bitter conflict, the tide slowly turned in favor of the templars. And somehow, the power of the curse was broken. Lycanthropy continued, but its effects weren't as strong, its victims not so driven to darkness.": "白银十字军持续了近五十年。前20年是一场残酷、血腥的运动。狼人在塔林的边缘（现在是Eldeen Reaches的一部分）大量集结，被一些未知的邪恶所驱使；大多数圣人认为那是一个即将打破束缚的霸主。圣殿骑士们不敌对手。狼人很狡猾，可以迅速补充他们的数量，他们故意挑起圣殿骑士和变身者之间的冲突。但经过几十年的激烈冲突，潮流慢慢转向对圣殿骑士有利。而且不知何故，诅咒的力量被打破了。狼人症继续存在，但它的影响没有那么强烈，它的受害者也没有那么被驱赶到黑暗中。",
	"While the true threat was dealt with, the peasants of Aundair had suffered through decades of terror and sought a greater revenge. The next thirty years saw an ongoing inquisition as zealous converts to the faith—later classified as an extremist sect, the Pure Flame—sought to hunt down every remaining lycanthrope. In the process, many innocents—including a great many shifters—were tortured and slain. So the Silver Crusade began as a selfless act that may well have saved Galifar, but ended up as an outlet for paranoia and hatred.": "虽然真正的威胁被解决了，但昂代尔的农民们经历了几十年的恐怖，并寻求更大的报复。在接下来的30年里，由于狂热的信仰皈依者--后来被归类为极端主义教派 \"纯正火焰\"--试图追捕所有剩余的狼人。在这个过程中，许多无辜的人--包括许多移居者--被折磨和杀戮。因此，银色十字军开始时是一种无私的行为，很可能拯救了加里法尔，但最后却成为一种偏执和仇恨的发泄。",
	"The Silver Crusade is a classic example of a virtuous act with bloody consequences. It highlights that the goals of the Silver Flame are to protect the innocent, but fear, greed, and anger can lead reasonable people astray. It's the origin of the Pure Flame, an extremist sect whose narrow vision of the Flame is as a ruthless weapon with which to burn evildoers. It has created a deep rift between shifters and followers of the Silver Flame, and hurt the reputation of shifters everywhere.": "银色十字军是一个典型的例子，说明了一个具有血腥后果的美德行为。它强调了银色火焰的目标是保护无辜者，但恐惧、贪婪和愤怒会使有理智的人误入歧途。这是 \"纯洁之火 \"的起源，这是一个极端主义教派，他们对 \"纯洁之火 \"的狭隘看法是将其作为一种无情的武器来烧死恶人。它在移居者和银色火焰的追随者之间造成了深刻的裂痕，并伤害了各地移居者的声誉。",
	"In the wake of the Silver Crusade, lycanthropy is considered to be a serious public health risk. Templars deal with any confirmed lycanthropes—when possible, they seek to apprehend and cure them, but lethal force is always an option. Lycanthropes can find a safe haven in Droaam (especially with the Dark Pack), and there are still a few scattered ‘thropes in Stormreach, Q'barra, Darguun, and other frontier nations.": "在白银十字军东征之后，狼人症被认为是一种严重的公共健康风险。圣殿骑士处理任何确认的狼人，在可能的情况下，他们寻求逮捕并治愈他们，但致命的武力总是一种选择。狼人可以在Droaam找到一个安全的避难所（特别是与黑暗族群一起），在Stormreach、Q'barra、Darguun和其他边境国家仍有一些零星的狼人。",
	"If you're playing a follower of the Silver Flame or a shifter, think about your view of the Silver Crusade. Likewise, if you're from Aundair or the Eldeen Reaches, consider if your family suffered during the lycanthropic terror.": "如果你扮演的是银色火焰的追随者或变身者，请考虑一下你对银色十字军的看法。同样地，如果你来自Aundair或Eldeen Reaches，请考虑你的家庭是否在狼人的恐怖中遭受了伤害。",

In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows—the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future.

	"The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King's Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together—the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the {@item everbright lantern|ERLW}, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece—a city of wonders—this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.": "加利法尔各省在很大程度上保留了它们曾经的国家的文化和传统。在许多方面，他们的差异得到了加强和颂扬。每个国家都有一个联合王国的支柱：昂代尔的奥术大会、布雷兰的国王城堡、卡尔纳特的雷肯马克学院、瑟兰的大神庙。赛尔是个例外。赛尔没有建立在梅特罗尔现有的文化上，而是从整个加利法尔吸引了专家和工匠。赛尔不是任何一个学科的中心，而是所有这些东西聚集在一起的枢纽--加利法尔可能是最好的。当奥术大会完善了{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}的时候，梅特罗尔是第一个街道被它们照亮的城市。士兵们在Rekkenmark训练，但最优秀的战士在Vermishard卫队服役。虽然梅特罗尔是展示品--一个充满奇迹的城市，但这一原则被应用于整个赛尔中部。通过教育、艺术、甚至农业，赛尔城展示了加利法尔能够完成的最好的东西。",
	"This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever.

	"Cyre's artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith's greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It's said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There's no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create,\" but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.": "赛尔的艺术气质（有人会说是异想天开）被坎尼斯家族的存在所平衡和维持，坎尼斯家族的总部设在伟大的制造之城。许多Cannith家族最伟大的锻造厂遍布赛尔城，为支持赛尔城的奇迹提供了一个实用的工业基础。而这些奇迹有很多形式。昂代尔的奥术大会专注于魔法的实际应用，而赛尔的维纳恩学院则探索奥术的艺术潜力。梅特罗尔是一座充满光明和奇迹的城市。游客可以与过去的英雄和国王的幻象对话，或者观看历史时刻的重演。据说，在梅特罗尔没有人挨饿，也没有人感受到冬天的叮咬。赛尔人说，这反映了赛尔人的慷慨和无私的精神；批评者指出，这些社会项目之所以能够实现，是因为其他省份的人民缴纳了税收。当然，赛尔掌握着加利法尔的财富，其生活水平高于其他任何省份。这是颓废吗？还是它是一个正在进行的工作，一个有朝一日可以应用于所有国家的模式？我们无从得知。居里人哀悼失去的东西；其他国家的人民批评居里人的生活方式是寄生的。\"我们的梦想是什么，我们的手就创造什么。\"但痛苦的局外人指出，虽然居里人的手可能已经建造，但他们使用的是别人辛勤工作收集的资源。",
	"This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar's traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch's children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.": "加利法尔的继承传统进一步助长了这种怨恨。以加利法尔一世为例，君主的子女担任五个省的总督。最年长的人管理赛尔，在君主去世后，他们将继承王位，他们的子女将接管各省的管理职位。之前的总督将作为摄政者，直到孩子们成年，之后则作为顾问。当一个君主没有五个孩子时，以前的总督将保留这些职位。但这个原则很简单。赛尔是加利法尔的心脏，其他一切都将围绕它进行。",
	"Galifar's goal with Cyre was to create something new, a culture combining the best aspects of the other nations. In the newly forged Thrane, Aundair, and Breland, the people kept their old traditions, and ruling families were often incorporated into the new governing structure; similarly, Galifar preserved the customs of his homeland of Karrnath. But in the old kingdom of Metrol—which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland—the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre's dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.": "加利法尔与赛尔的目标是创造新的东西，一种结合了其他国家的最佳方面的文化。在新成立的瑟兰（Thrane）、昂代尔（Aundair）和布雷兰（Breland），人们保留了他们的旧传统，统治家族往往被纳入新的管理结构中；同样，加利法尔也保留了他的家乡卡尔纳特（Karrnath）的习俗。但在旧的梅特罗尔王国--它的面积和形状大致相当于现代的哀牢地--旧的制度和统治者被推到一边，为赛尔的梦想腾出空间。梅特罗尔的一些贵族家庭接受了这条新路。其他人则被加利法尔重新安置，被授予对以前作为独立边界存在的地区的权力。",

There were ongoing clashes with goblins, a few severe, but the Ghaal'dar goblinoid clans largely remained in the mountains and dark places until the Last War.": "覆盖了现在的Darguun。在加里法尔建立时，它基本上没有得到解决，一直是王国阴影下的一个落后地区。它的人民最终繁荣起来，并以他们作为锡兰人的身份为荣，模仿中央王国的习俗。然而，他们几乎没有投资于北方的财富或随之而来的奇迹。与哥布林的冲突不断，有几次很严重，但Ghaal'dar的哥布林氏族基本上都留在了山区和黑暗的地方，直到最后一次战争。",
	"—now Valenar—was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar's greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it's because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called \"thrones\"), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime.": "-现在的瓦伦纳（Valenar）实际上是一个独立的国家，有着截然不同的文化和价值观。这可以说是加利法尔最失败的地方。该地区最初是由来自萨尔罗纳西部的库南地区的移民定居的。加利法尔一世想要旧梅特罗尔的土地，所以他把东赛尔的权力交给了其贵族，让他们成为库南定居者的封建领主。刀锋沙漠是物理和文化上的分界线，在授予贵族们土地后，加利法尔基本上没有理会他们。因此，贵族家庭坚持梅特罗尔的旧传统，而不是接受赛尔的新文化。许多人小气而骄傲，对这种安排不满意，并残忍地把气撒在他们的库南臣民身上。有些人想知道为什么精灵们夺取瓦伦纳的控制权如此简单；首先是因为库南人对他们的赛尔统治者（一般称为 \"王位\"）没有爱，许多人觉得他们在新政权下其实过得更好。",

Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre—expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with House Orien to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.": "在雅罗特国王的统治下，赛尔城继续发光发热。有抱负的艺术家和年轻的贵族们纷纷来到王国的中心，而最有前途的工匠们则在制造之城定居。贾罗特国王对赛尔城给予了极大的关注--扩大了弗米沙德宫，与奥瑞恩家族合作扩大了赛尔城的闪电轨道，并在威纳恩艺术学院和圣主大教堂上花费了数十万加里法。",
	"Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre's finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a paladin, Karrnath is a fighter, Aundair is a wizard, and Breland is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard—elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.": "贾罗特死后，加利法尔王国向战争螺旋式上升。起初，赛伦人的士气很高。米珊女王背后有几个世纪的传统。每个人都知道赛尔拥有最好的东西：最好的巫师，最好的士兵，最重要的工匠。从某种程度上说，这是真的，但当与卡尔纳特或瑟兰的武术文化相比，一支由杰出士兵组成的部队意义不大。赛尔最优秀的巫师是艺术家和理论学者，而昂代尔则长期致力于将魔法作为战争的工具。而专家级的工匠们在很大程度上与坎尼斯家族联系在一起，后者在战争中保持中立。如果把各国视为角色，瑟兰是圣骑士，卡尔纳特是战士，昂代尔是巫师，布雷兰德是流氓。在这个党派中，赛尔是酒吧--优雅、聪明，什么都会做一点......但在与他人合作时最好，不准备单独对抗强大的敌人。",
	"Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar's treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be—and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King's Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre's new military academy. But it was clear that the Cyran dream had been sustained by many hands, and now the nation had to learn to stand on its own.": "赛尔适应了；它必须这样做。起初，它严重依赖雇佣兵，因为它是加利法尔的国库所在地，有多余的黄金。但随着时间的推移和冲突范围的明确，赛尔人投身于战争。赛尔缺乏卡尔纳特或瑟兰的尚武精神，但它的人民因绝对相信他们是正确的而得到支持。除此之外，在人们的眼中，赛尔就是加利法尔。它体现了王国的理想，它可能成为的最好的东西--而这是值得为之奋斗的东西。尽管如此，这场斗争对赛尔人的心理造成了巨大的打击。几个世纪以来，赛尔人一直将自己视为表演的明星，受到所有人的爱戴；现在所有的人都在反对他们，至少有些人可以将他们以前的信仰视为傲慢和自恋。赛尔确实拥有最好的东西，但这是因为它是免费提供的。现在，奥术大会将其知识纯粹用于Aundair的利益，Rekkenmark只训练Karrns，而国王的城堡则为Breland服务。是的，赛尔有所有这些东西的回声。它的巫师仍然是除昂代尔之外的任何国家的对手，而弗米沙德卫队构成了赛尔新军事学院的核心。但很明显，赛尔的梦想是由许多人支持的，现在这个国家必须学会自立。",
	"For a millennium since its founding, Cyran culture blended the traditions of other nations. However, the Last War built walls between Cyre and the other nations, and each evolved in this century of relative isolation. Cyrans know the old add-a-verse songs beloved by Aundairians, but few know the {@i Epic of Valiant and Vigilant}, a tale of martial bravery close to the heart of every modern Aundairian. Nor do they know the maxims of Beggar Dane that now serve as a cornerstone of Brelish culture.": "在建国后的一千年里，赛尔文化融合了其他国家的传统。然而，最后的战争在赛尔和其他国家之间筑起了围墙，在这个相对孤立的世纪里，每个国家都在不断发展。赛尔人知道昂代尔人所喜爱的古老的加词歌曲，但很少有人知道{@i Epic of Valiant and Vigilant}，这是一个与每个现代昂代尔人心心相印的武勇故事。他们也不知道乞丐丹恩的格言，这些格言现在是布莱里什文化的一个基石。",
	"Even so, Cyrans see their culture as being founded on the best principles of Galifar, and can still find some common ground with people of any nation. A Cyran can play Conqueror with a Karrn, sing an add-a-verse song with an Aundairian, and debate religion with a Thrane. This reflects the founding principles of Cyre—to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there's no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there's always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera—a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it's a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they're constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation—that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better. But the Cyrans themselves assert that this approach is rooted in love, not arrogance, and call it the \"Cyran appreciation.\"": "即便如此，赛伦人认为他们的文化是建立在加利法尔的最佳原则之上的，并且仍然可以与任何国家的人找到一些共同点。赛尔人可以和卡恩人一起玩征服者游戏，和昂代尔人一起唱一首加冕歌曲，和瑟兰人一起辩论宗教。这反映了赛尔的创始原则--收集加利法尔最好的方面并在此基础上发展。赛尔人相信没有一条完美的道路；多样性是力量的源泉，但总是有改进的空间。因此，Cyran文化是一个奇怪的混合体--来自整个Khorvaire的熟悉元素与稳定、持续的进化相结合。西兰音乐家可能会用瑟兰人的虔诚风格演奏卡尔纳提人的葬礼哀歌；这是一个拼图，其中的碎片是已知的，但它们不断以新的方式被排列。其他国家的一些公民认为这是盗用--锡兰人是腐肉爬行者，他们偷窃别人的东西，却傲慢地认为自己能做得更好。但居里人自己断言，这种做法是源于爱，而不是傲慢，并称其为 \"居里人的欣赏\"。",
	"In playing a Cyran, you can find familiar things anywhere you go. But what do you treasure in your memories of Cyre? Do you cling to the past, or do you embrace the Cyran principle of always striving to find a new and better way?": "在扮演赛尔号的过程中，你走到哪里都能找到熟悉的东西。但在你对赛尔的记忆中，你珍惜什么呢？你是紧紧抓住过去，还是接受赛尔号的原则，一直努力寻找一种新的更好的方式？",
	"Cyran fashion blends practicality with endless diversity. Cyran clothing begins with a simple foundation—this base layer may be colorful, but it's first and foremost practical and durable. Whether breeches, skirts, shirts, or gowns, a Cyran starts with whatever the wearer finds most comfortable. Again, this base level is well made, but it's more functional than decorative.": "Cyran时尚融合了实用性和无尽的多样性。Cyran服装从一个简单的基础开始--这个基础层可能是彩色的，但它首先是实用和耐用的。无论是马裤、裙子、衬衫还是长袍，Cyran人从佩戴者认为最舒适的东西开始。同样，这个基础层做得很好，但它的功能性大于装饰性。",
	"After starting with simplicity, the Cyran adds flair. Cloaks and gloves are both integral parts of Cyran fashion. Gloves can be short and sturdy for work or war, or long and decorative for more formal occasions. Cloaks likewise vary between the practical and decorative: a heavy cloak for traveling, a short cape for casual socializing, and a long, light cloak with a {@item glamerweave|ERLW} lining for an evening at the Grand Stage. In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion. Often made from copper, leather, wood, or glass, Cyran jewelry is not a display of wealth, but rather a way to express individuality. Feathers and bells are also common accessories; there is a Cyran dance that involves belled bracelets and anklets. Finally, masks are often worn at formal or festive occasions. Cyran masks aren't intended to conceal identity or intent; rather, they are a way of enhancing identity and expressing a mood.": "从简单开始后，Cyran人增加了炫耀。斗篷和手套都是赛兰人时装的组成部分。手套可以是用于工作或战争的短而结实的，也可以是用于更正式场合的长而装饰性的。斗篷也同样在实用性和装饰性之间变化：厚重的斗篷用于旅行，短斗篷用于休闲社交，而长而轻的斗篷带有{@item glamerweave|ERLW}衬里，用于大舞台的夜晚。除了手套、靴子和斗篷等服装外，珠宝和其他配件也是锡兰时尚的重要组成部分。通常由铜、皮革、木头或玻璃制成，居里安人的珠宝不是财富的展示，而是表达个性的一种方式。羽毛和铃铛也是常见的配饰；有一种居里安人的舞蹈涉及到带铃铛的手链和脚链。最后，面具经常在正式或节日的场合佩戴。居里安人的面具并不是为了掩盖身份或意图；相反，它们是增强身份和表达心情的一种方式。",
	"Traditionally, Cyran fashion is filled with color (often accentuated with {@item glamerweave|ERLW}). In the wake of the Last War, many Cyrans have adopted Mourningwear—clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black. Others celebrate their nation by preserving its styles. Because of the emphasis on durability, your Cyran character may still have the clothes they were wearing on the Day of Mourning. What was that outfit, and do you still wear it? Do you favor a mask, and if so, what is its design?": "传统上，居里夫人的时装充满了色彩（通常用（%0%）来强调）。在最后一次战争之后，许多锡兰人采用了丧服--按锡兰风格剪裁的衣服，但完全是黑色的。其他人则通过保留其风格来庆祝他们的国家。由于强调耐用性，你的赛伦人角色可能还保留着他们在哀悼日所穿的衣服。那件衣服是什么，你还穿吗？你是否偏爱面具，如果是的话，它的设计是什么？",
	"Cyran cuisine reflects the Cyran principles of working with the best of all traditions while continuing to explore. In many ways, this is similar to the Sharn fusion found in the City of Towers, and a number of Cyran refugees are rising stars in Sharn's culinary scene. Cyrans blend the thrakel spices of Thrane with traditional Karrn stews, and add the heat of southern Breland to the delicate pastries of Aundair. While many refugees cling to family recipes as a way to remember the fallen nation, others continue the tradition of Cyran appreciation—adopting new favorites from the place they've found shelter and looking for ways to improve them.": "西兰美食反映了西兰的原则，即在继续探索的同时，与所有传统中的精华合作。在许多方面，这类似于在塔城发现的沙恩融合，一些赛兰难民是沙恩烹饪界的新星。西兰人将瑟兰的香料与传统的卡恩炖菜相融合，并将南部布雷兰的热度加入到昂代尔的精致糕点中。许多难民坚持使用家族食谱，以此来缅怀逝去的国家，而其他难民则继续保持着欣赏锡兰人的传统--从他们找到庇护所的地方采用新的最爱，并寻找改进它们的方法。",
	"Traditionally, Cyrans viewed arcane magic as an art form as well as a practical tool. This lent itself to a wider study of illusion and enchantment than found in other nations. But it's also about the presentation of magic, regardless of its school. Whether magewright, bard, or wizard, Cyrans often put more show into the performance of magic than even the Aundairians. For a wizard who's studied at the Wynarn Institute, somatic components are almost a dance, while verbal components have the cadence of song or poetry. This echoes the Cyran love of flowing capes and cloaks. As a Cyran spellcaster, you are truly a student of arcane arts; consider how your casting reflects this.": "传统上，锡兰人将神秘的魔法视为一种艺术形式以及一种实用工具。这使其对幻觉和魔法的研究比其他国家更广泛。但这也是关于魔法的展示，无论其流派如何。无论是魔法师、吟游诗人还是巫师，锡兰人在表演魔法时往往比昂代尔人更注重表演。对于一个在维纳恩学院学习过的巫师来说，身体的部分几乎是一种舞蹈，而语言的部分则有歌曲或诗歌的韵律。这与锡兰人对飘逸的披风和斗篷的喜爱相呼应。作为一个居里夫人的施法者，你是真正的奥术学生；考虑你的施法如何反映这一点。",
	"The Silver Flame had some devoted followers and temples in central Cyre, though the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith. However, religion is driven by faith and tradition, and Cyrans have always been encouraged to question and search for new paths. Outer Cyre is a different story. The nobles of Eastern Cyre were and are devout Vassals, convinced they have a divine right to leadership. The people of Southern Cyre are less arrogant, but most hold to a quiet, steadfast faith in the Sovereigns.": "银色火焰在赛尔中部有一些忠实的追随者和庙宇，尽管主权主神是主导性的信仰。然而，宗教是由信仰和传统驱动的，赛尔人一直被鼓励去质疑和寻找新的道路。外赛尔是一个不同的故事。东赛尔的贵族过去和现在都是虔诚的Vassals，坚信他们有神圣的领导权。南部赛尔的人民没有那么傲慢，但大多数人对君主抱有安静、坚定的信仰。",
	"The war drove some Cyrans to embrace their faith more tightly, but for others it was another source of doubt. Likewise, the Mourning threw many devout Cyrans into a crisis of faith, while for others, it actually strengthened it. A devout follower of the Silver Flame doesn't question the cause of the Mourning, they simply seek to protect the innocent from harm. Vassals of the Sovereign Host trust that there is a purpose to their suffering. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Mourning, some Cyrans have turned to the Blood of Vol or cults of the Dragon Below, cursing the gods they once worshiped or following a darker vision. There are also a number of new strains of the old faiths, Cyran twists on the Flame and the Host that seek to adapt traditions to make sense of the war and the world.": "战争促使一些居里人更紧密地拥抱他们的信仰，但对其他人来说，它是另一个怀疑的来源。同样地，哀悼使许多虔诚的赛伦人陷入了信仰危机，而对其他人来说，它实际上加强了信仰。银色火焰的虔诚追随者并不质疑哀悼的原因，他们只是寻求保护无辜者免受伤害。主宰者的附庸相信他们的痛苦是有目的的。同时，在哀悼之后，一些赛兰人转向沃尔之血或龙下的邪教，诅咒他们曾经崇拜的神灵或追随更黑暗的愿景。也有一些旧信仰的新变种，赛兰人对火焰和主人的扭曲，试图调整传统以了解战争和世界的意义。",
	"In playing a Cyran, whether a divine caster or other religious character, consider the impact the Mourning had on your faith. Are you conflicted and struggling to hold to your beliefs? Or was the Mourning a source of inspiration—you know you have a divine purpose, that your people need you? If you're tied to an existing faith, do you follow the standard traditions or have you found an unusual path?": "在扮演Cyran时，无论是神圣的施法者还是其他宗教角色，都要考虑哀悼对你的信仰产生的影响。你是在矛盾中挣扎着坚持自己的信仰？或者说，丧礼是灵感的来源--你知道你有一个神圣的目的，你的人民需要你？如果你与现有的信仰相联系，你是遵循标准的传统，还是找到了一条不寻常的道路？",
	"When most people say \"Cyre,\" they're thinking of central Cyre. When they speak of Cyran refugees, they are referring to the people who fled the Mourning. But there were Cyran refugees long before the end of the war. The Tairnadal elves established the eastern kingdom of Valenar in 956 YK, while Lhesh Haruuc claimed Southern Cyre as Darguun in 969 YK. While Valenar was an unpleasant surprise, it had relatively little impact on the nation. Eastern Cyre had always been isolated, and the Khunan majority embraced elf rule; the refugees were thus a handful of nobles who were painfully out of touch with the traditions of the central kingdom. The loss of Darguun was a more significant blow; Southern Cyre was a backwater, but this was still close to home, and it resulted in a flood of refugees that the war-torn nation was ill-prepared to handle. In creating a Cyran character, consider which Cyre you're from.": "当大多数人说 \"赛尔 \"时，他们想到的是赛尔中部。当他们说到Cyran难民时，他们指的是逃离哀牢的人。但早在战争结束前就有赛尔族难民了。泰尔纳达尔精灵在956 YK年建立了东部的瓦勒纳王国，而Lhesh Haruuc在969 YK年宣称南赛尔为达尔古恩。虽然瓦勒纳是一个令人不快的惊喜，但它对国家的影响相对较小。东赛尔一直与世隔绝，库南人多数接受精灵统治；因此难民是少数贵族，他们与中央王国的传统痛苦地脱节。达尔古恩的丢失是一个更重大的打击；南赛尔是一个落后的地方，但这仍然离家很近，它导致了难民的涌入，这个饱受战争蹂躏的国家没有做好准备来处理。在创建Cyran角色时，要考虑你来自哪个Cyre。",
	"If you're from central Cyre, odds are good that you think of your home as the \"true\" Cyre. Before the Mourning, did you give much thought to the refugees of Valenar and Darguun? Even now, do you think of them when you think of your homeland? Are you devoted to the idea of rebuilding your nation and clinging to your memories and traditions? Or following the Cyran appreciation, are you instead looking forward and trying to find a new and better path, even if that means abandoning the dreams of Cyre?": "如果你来自赛尔中部，你很有可能认为你的家是 \"真正的 \"赛尔。在哀悼之前，你是否考虑过瓦勒纳和达尔古恩的难民？即使是现在，当你想到你的祖国时，你会想到他们吗？你是否致力于重建你的国家，并紧紧抓住你的记忆和传统？还是遵循赛伦的赞赏，你反而向前看，试图找到一条新的、更好的道路，即使这意味着放弃赛尔的梦想？",
	"As an Eastern Cyran, you're tied to a noble family with roots in old Metrol, before Galifar even existed. You don't accept any of the nonsense about Cyre being \"the best of Galifar\" or challenging tradition; if people had stuck to the old ways, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Your people were devoted to the Sovereign Host and truly believed that Aureon had chosen you to rule. At the same time, your lands have been lost for over forty years, and the people of central Cyre have never avenged you or shown your family the respect you deserve. You're not as affected by the Mourning as some, because it wasn't your Cyre that was destroyed—now the others just get to see how you feel. While your character has noble ancestry, you're unlikely to choose the noble background, as nobody would care about such claims. Do you despise the Valenar and hope to reclaim your long-lost homeland? Or do you want to rally Cyran survivors around the {@i true} royal bloodlines, challenging Oargev and reestablishing the long-forgotten kingdom of Metrol?": "作为东锡兰人，你与一个贵族家庭联系在一起，根植于古老的梅托尔，甚至在加利法尔存在之前。你不接受任何关于赛尔是 \"加利法尔最好的 \"或挑战传统的废话；如果人们坚持旧有的方式，也许这一切都可以避免了。你们的人民忠于主宰者，真正相信奥里昂选择了你们来统治。同时，你的土地已经失去了四十多年，赛尔中部的人们从未为你报过仇，也没有对你的家人表示应有的尊重。你不像有些人那样受到哀悼的影响，因为被摧毁的不是你的赛尔城--现在其他人只是看到了你的感受。虽然你的角色有贵族血统，但你不太可能选择贵族背景，因为没有人会关心这种说法。你是否鄙视瓦伦纳人并希望夺回你失散多年的家园？或者你想把Cyran的幸存者团结在{@i true}王室血统周围，挑战Oargev，重建被遗忘已久的Metrol王国？",
	"Your people have been struggling for decades in Southern Cyre, eking out a life in camps and shelters. You were encouraged to take up military service—it was easier to send you to the front than to find a new home for you.

Were you an optimistic idealist? Or were you bitter and angry at the nation that failed to protect you? Are you loyal to Cyre, or are you solely concerned with Darguun and taking vengeance on the goblins?": "你们的人民在南赛尔挣扎了几十年，在难民营和收容所里勉强度日。你们被鼓励去服兵役--把你们送到前线比给你们找一个新家更容易。你的许多朋友和家人都选择崇拜丹妮尔女王和赛尔中央，认为她有远见，会重建加利法尔，恢复一个奇迹的时代。你有这种感觉吗？你是一个乐观的理想主义者吗？还是你对这个未能保护你的国家感到痛苦和愤怒？你是忠于赛尔，还是只关心达尔古恩和向妖精们复仇？",

What forces can be found patrolling the borders? And what were some of the major innovations of the Last War?": "一眼望去，霍尔韦尔会显得很有中世纪特色。士兵们手持长矛和剑，瑟兰因其弓箭手而闻名。但魔法是五国生活的核心部分，用于通信、运输、娱乐......以及战争。上一次战争的战场上使用了哪些武器？哪些部队可以在边境上巡逻？最后一次战争的一些主要创新是什么？",
	"To clarify what lies ahead: This section does not present a system for running mass combats. Rather, it explores the tools and tactics used in the Last War so that adventures can incorporate those elements into the story. This allows for an adventure in which the heroes have to make their way through a field of {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}, or must seize a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} to halt bombardment. But this section doesn't include a system detailing artillery spotting and the accuracy of sustained bombardment. It explores the tools of the Last War with the intent that they could appear in traditional adventures.": "为了澄清前面的内容。本节并没有提出一个进行大规模战斗的系统。相反，它探讨了最后战争中使用的工具和战术，以便冒险可以将这些元素纳入故事中。这允许冒险中的英雄们必须穿过（%0%）的领域，或者必须夺取一个（%1%）来阻止轰炸。但这一节并不包括详细介绍炮兵发现的系统和持续轰炸的准确性。它探讨了最后战争的工具，目的是让它们可以出现在传统的冒险中。",
	"Wands, staffs, and rods are well-established weapons in the world of Eberron. Similarly, arcane artillery doesn't employ any sort of physical projectile, relying solely on magical energy—but rather than a small weapon one person can easily carry, arcane artillery refers to a variety of larger arcane foci that can increase the range and area of magical attacks. Likewise, the war employed magical explosives such as {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} that could wreak devastation by triggering a previously stored spell.": "魔杖、法杖和棒子是Eberron世界中公认的武器。同样，奥术火炮也不采用任何种类的物理弹丸，完全依靠魔法能量--但奥术火炮不是一个人可以轻易携带的小武器，而是指各种较大的奥术焦点，可以增加魔法攻击的范围和面积。同样，战争中采用了魔法炸药，如{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}，可以通过触发先前储存的法术而造成破坏。",
	"As a general rule, the everyday magic of the Five Nations encompasses spell effects of up to 3rd level; while 4th- and 5th-level effects exist, they are rare and remarkable. This means that effects like {@spell wall of force} could be seen on the battlefield, but were exceptional and rarely deployed, while blasts of fire and lightning were more common.": "一般来说，五国的日常魔法包含了3级以下的法术效果；虽然4级和5级的效果也存在，但它们是罕见的、了不起的。这意味着像（%0%）这样的效果可以在战场上看到，但属于例外，很少部署，而火焰和闪电的爆炸则比较常见。",
	"While a specially trained spellcaster must operate arcane artillery, more than one person can assist with its operation, allowing a team to prime, aim, and fire in a single round.": "虽然必须由受过专门训练的施法者来操作奥术火炮，但不止一个人可以协助其操作，允许一个团队在一个回合内进行填料、瞄准和射击。",
	"All attack rolls and saving throws are based on the spellcasting ability of the operator firing the weapon. When arcane artillery is used to target someone at long range, any attack roll has disadvantage and any saving throw against the spell effect has advantage.": "所有的攻击卷和蓄力都是基于发射武器的操作员的法术能力。当奥术火炮被用来瞄准远距离的人时，任何攻击卷都是劣势，任何针对法术效果的蓄力都是优势。",
	"Using these weapons requires specialized training, similar to that of an artificer or magewright; someone trained to operate arcane artillery is generally called a bombardier. A typical bombardier may use the magewright stat block, but they also know one or more spells that they're only able to cast using a focus—such as a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} or {@object long rod|ExploringEberron}. So an Aundairian specialist might be able to produce {@spell cloudkill} through a focus, but not cast the spell on its own. Bombardiers don't use spell slots when casting these spells; instead, they prime the weapon using a dragonshard solution known as the {@i breath of Siberys}.": "使用这些武器需要专门的训练，类似于工匠或魔法师的训练；受过操作奥术火炮训练的人一般被称为投弹手。一个典型的投弹手可以使用魔法师的属性块，但他们也知道一个或多个法术，他们只能用一个焦点来施放--比如（%0%）或（%1%）。所以一个Aundairian专家可能能够通过一个焦点产生{@spell cloudkill}，但不能单独施放该法术。投弹手在施放这些法术时不使用法术槽；相反，他们使用被称为{@i breath of Siberys}的龙石溶液为武器打底。",
	"However, player characters are more versatile than magewrights or bombardiers. The DM could allow your spellcasting character to use artillery without penalty if it fits the needs of the story or if you have a background that justifies it—for example, if you're a wizard with the soldier background. Otherwise, the DM could say that you can operate it at a penalty: you can't cast spells or make attacks at long range; your attack rolls have disadvantage; and saving throws against your attacks have advantage. As a player character, you can prime the weapon using the {@i breath of Siberys}, or you can expend a spell slot as usual when priming the artillery.": "然而，玩家角色比魔法师或投弹手的用途更广泛。DM可以允许你的法术角色使用火炮而不受惩罚，如果这符合故事的需要，或者你的背景证明了这一点--例如，如果你是一个有士兵背景的魔法师。否则，管理员可以说你可以在受到惩罚的情况下操作它：你不能在远距离施法或进行攻击；你的攻击卷有劣势；对你的攻击进行蓄力攻击有优势。作为一个玩家角色，你可以使用（%0%）给武器打底，或者像往常一样在给火炮打底时消耗一个法术槽。",
	"While arcane artillery is a powerful force, there's still a place for mundane siege engines that use physical projectiles, described in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The {@object ballista}, {@object mangonel}, and {@object trebuchet} are all common forms of artillery, seen on both the battlefield and on warships. However, just as a Thrane archer may have used an enchanted bow, the siege engines of the Last War are enhanced with magical power.": "虽然奥术火炮是一种强大的力量，但使用物理弹丸的世俗攻城引擎仍有一席之地，在《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》的第八章中有所描述。{@object ballista}、{@object mangonel}和{@object trebuchet}都是常见的火炮形式，在战场上和战舰上都能看到。然而，就像瑟兰弓箭手可能使用被施了魔法的弓一样，最后战争的攻城引擎也是用魔法力量加强的。",
	"A siege engine can be partially animated, speeding its use. Generally, an animated engine loads itself while the crew aims it, requiring only two actions to fire an animated ballista or three to use an animated mangonel. House Cannith also manufactured fully animated siege engines, capable of self-aiming. Such an engine required the same number of actions to aim and fire as a crewed engine, it simply had no need of a crew. However, these engines could only follow simple instructions and had little ability to adapt, requiring clear, absolute orders to be effective: {@i \"Continue to attack the north tower until it is destroyed.\"}": "攻城车可以部分动画化，以加快其使用速度。一般来说，在工作人员瞄准它的时候，动画引擎会自动加载，只需要两个动作就可以发射动画弹幕，或者三个动作就可以使用动画芒果。坎尼斯家族还制造了完全动画化的攻城引擎，能够自我瞄准。这样的引擎在瞄准和发射时所需的行动次数与有船员的引擎相同，它只是不需要船员。然而，这些引擎只能听从简单的指令，没有什么适应能力，需要明确、绝对的命令才能有效：（%0%）。",
	"A {@object cannon} is a weapon that can inflict significant bludgeoning damage at great distances. As noted in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, a cannon doesn't have to use gunpowder, and those used in the Last War did not. The most common form of cannon is the {@i elemental cannon} produced by the gnomes of Zilargo, which uses the essence of a bound earth elemental to project stone cannonballs with tremendous force; Zilargo began supplying Breland with these weapons toward the end of the Last War. While Cannith and the Five Nations experimented with other cannon models, the {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} typically filled this role on the battlefield.": "{@object cannon}是一种可以在很远的距离上造成巨大的打击性伤害的武器。如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}所述，大炮不一定要使用火药，在最后一次战争中使用的大炮就没有。最常见的加农炮是由Zilargo的地精生产的{@i elemental cannon}，它使用一个被束缚的土元素的精华来投射具有巨大力量的石制炮弹；Zilargo在最后一次战争结束时开始向布雷兰德提供这些武器。虽然坎尼斯和五国试验了其他的大炮型号，但{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}通常在战场上充当这一角色。",
	"Ballista bolts and mangonel missiles are often enchanted with spell effects that trigger when the bolt strikes its target. This effect is in addition to the standard damage inflicted by the siege engine.": "弩炮弹和芒果导弹通常被赋予法术效果，当弩炮弹击中目标时就会触发。这种效果是在攻城机造成的标准伤害之外的。",
	"{@i Explosive ammunition} affects a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the bolt. Any creature in the area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 3d6}) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Typically, {@i explosive ammunition} deals fire damage, igniting flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. However, Karrnathi {@i deathbolts} deal necrotic damage and only harm living creatures, while Thrane {@i Tira's tears} deal radiant damage.": "{@i Explosive ammunition}影响到以闪电冲击为中心的30英尺半径范围的球体。区域内的任何生物必须做一个{@dc 15}灵巧的蓄力动作，蓄力失败会受到10({@damage 3d6})的伤害，蓄力成功会受到一半的伤害。通常情况下，{@i explosive ammunition}会造成火灾伤害，点燃没有被穿戴或携带的易燃物品。然而，Karrnathi {@i deathbolts}会造成坏死伤害，并且只伤害生物，而Thrane {@i Tira's tears}会造成辐射伤害。",
	"{@i Summoning ammunition} conjures creatures around the point of impact. Aundairian {@i firestones} produce a temporary flaming sphere that randomly rolls around the area of impact. Zil binders developed a more powerful form of this ammunition which casts {@spell conjure elemental} on detonation, but it is extremely costly and rare.": "{@i Summoning ammunition}在撞击点周围召唤生物。Aundairian {@i firestones}产生一个临时的火焰球体，随机地在撞击区域周围滚动。齐尔捆绑器开发了一种更强大的这种弹药，在引爆时施放{@spell conjure elemental}，但它非常昂贵且罕见。",
	"{@i Panic stones} force all creatures within a 90-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the stone to make a {@dc 12} Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw drops whatever it is holding and becomes {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use the {@action Dash} action to move away from the {@i panic stone}. If an affected creature ends its turn more than 90 feet away from the {@i panic stone}, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for that creature.": "{@i Panic stones}迫使以石头撞击为中心的90英尺半径范围内的所有生物做一个{@dc 12}智慧反射。任何失败的生物都会丢掉手中的东西，并在1分钟内变得（%2%）。受到惊吓的生物必须使用{@action Dash}行动来远离{@i panic stone}。如果受影响的生物在距离（%5%）超过90英尺的地方结束其回合，它可以做一个智慧救赎动作。拯救成功后，该生物的效果就会结束。",
	"The {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron} is the most common form of magical explosive used in the Five Nations. While {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} serve a similar role to bombs or landmines, they can produce a wide range of magical effects; a {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron} could trigger a burst of confusion and start a riot, or summon a rampaging elemental into a crowded town square.": "{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron}是五国中最常见的魔法爆炸物形式。虽然(1%)的作用与炸弹或地雷相似，但它们可以产生广泛的魔法效果；(2%)可以引发一阵混乱并引发暴乱，或将一个狂暴的元素召唤到拥挤的城镇广场。",

	"At first glance, the damage associated with many weapons described here may seem low. How is it that a massive siege staff could end up dealing less damage than a {@item staff of fire}? But in developing weapons of war, consider who those weapons are targeting. The typical soldier in the armies of the Five Nations would use the {@creature guard} or {@creature bandit} stat block, both of which have 11 hit points. When large numbers were called for, nations would employ peasant levies, most of who would use the {@creature commoner} stat block with a mere 4 hit points.": "乍一看，这里描述的许多武器的相关伤害可能看起来很低。一个巨大的攻城杖最终造成的伤害怎么会比一个{@item staff of fire}还要低呢？但在开发战争武器时，要考虑这些武器的目标是谁。五国军队中的典型士兵会使用{@creature guard}或{@creature bandit}状态块，它们都有11点命中率。当需要大量的士兵时，国家会雇佣农民，他们中的大多数会使用仅有4点命中率的{@creature commoner}状态块。",
	"Hit points are an abstract concept, a \"combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.\" That range of 4-11 hit points is normal; a typical person on the street could be mortally wounded by a single well-placed crossbow bolt. The high hit points of exceptional individuals—such as player characters—reflect their role as heroes, people who somehow avoid a deadly strike or who can grit their teeth and persevere through damage that would send a lesser person into shock. When designing weapons and battle magic, the mages of Arcanix and artificers of the Twelve were using the typical soldier as the baseline, not a player character.": "命中率是一个抽象的概念，是 \"身体和精神的耐久性、生存意志和运气的结合\"。4-11点的命中率范围是正常的；街上的一个普通人可能会被一个位置良好的弩箭射中而受致命伤。特殊个体的高命中率--比如玩家角色--反映了他们作为英雄的角色，他们以某种方式避免了致命的一击，或者能够咬紧牙关，坚持完成会让一个较小的人陷入休克的伤害。在设计武器和战斗魔法时，阿卡尼克斯的法师和十二星座的工匠们是以典型的士兵为基准，而不是以玩家角色为基准。",
	"So consider the {@spell fireball}. It has a range of 150 feet, affects a 20-foot sphere, and deals {@damage 8d6} fire damage. This is designed for an elite squad fighting against exceptional foes: it deals high damage with a significant area of effect. But imagine you're fighting 120 guards with longbows, who start shooting at you once you enter their long range of 600 feet. You may never get close enough to cast your {@spell fireball}. Even if you do, the damage output is far greater than you need (an average of 28 damage against enemies with 11 hit points). {@spell Fireball} is an excellent tool for a small squad engaging powerful foes, which describes the typical party of adventurers. But on a battlefield of common soldiers, it proves inefficient, as range and radius are more important than high damage output. The {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} may not inflict as much damage as a {@item staff of fire}, but it hits more enemies and from farther away.": "所以要考虑（%0%）。它的范围是150英尺，影响20英尺的范围，并造成{@damage 8d6}的火力伤害。这是为精英小队对抗特殊敌人而设计的：它能造成高额伤害，并有很大的影响范围。但想象一下，你正在与120名手持长弓的卫兵作战，一旦你进入他们600英尺的远距离范围，他们就开始向你射击。你可能永远无法接近到足以施放你的（%2%）。即使你做到了，伤害输出也远远超过你的需要（对11点命中率的敌人平均28点伤害）。{@spell Fireball}是一个小队对付强大敌人的优秀工具，这就是典型的冒险者队伍。但在普通士兵的战场上，它被证明是低效的，因为范围和半径比高伤害输出更重要。(4%)的伤害可能没有(5%)的多，但它能从更远的地方击中更多的敌人。",
	"This impacts how scenes unfold when your player character is on the battlefield. In the interests of story, the DM doesn't want your party to be wiped out by the first blast of a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}; how is that a compelling adventure? Instead, that blast might deal only 12 points of fire damage. It drops half of the soldiers accompanying you (who failed their saving throws), but you and your companions take shelter from the worst of the blast and keep pressing forward. {@damage 3d6} damage may feel low because it won't kill a player character. But it can kill commoners and typical soldiers; the fact that adventurers can keep going under fire shows how remarkable they are.": "这影响到你的玩家角色在战场上的场景如何展开。为了故事的利益，DM不希望你的队伍被{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}的第一次爆炸所消灭；这怎么会是一次引人注目的冒险呢？相反，那场爆炸可能只造成12点火力伤害。它使与你同行的士兵中的一半人死亡（他们的救赎失败），但你和你的同伴们躲避了最严重的爆炸，继续向前推进。(1%）的伤害可能感觉很低，因为它不会杀死一个玩家角色。但它可以杀死平民和典型的士兵；冒险者能在炮火下继续前进，说明他们是多么了不起。",
	"While the elemental airship is a recent innovation, aerial combat has long been a part of warfare. Flying scouts are a basic component of reconnaissance.

The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the {@i war staff} and {@i battle rod}. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it's no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people \"arcane dragoons.\" If you fight your battles with {@spell fire bolt} or {@spell sacred flame}, you're known as a \"wandslinger.\"": "魔法是会进化的。当加利法尔一世建立他的王国时，他的巫师们还没有掌握（%0%）或（%1%）。咒语--可以随意使用的休闲法术--的发展花了几个世纪，因为奥术大会研究了Aereni技术和巫术的力量。联合王国的士兵们依靠的是剑和弓。但是，随着最后一次战争的开始，Aundair对其资源进行了评估。由于奥术大会的存在，昂代尔在神秘主义教育方面领先于加利法尔。组建了第一个奥术兵团，昂代尔开发了{@i war staff}和{@i battle rod}。在最后一次战争的过程中，这些技术传遍了五国和其他国家。今天，看到强悍的探究者或哨兵元帅一手拿着剑，一手拿着魔杖，并不奇怪。但没有人称这些人为 \"奥术兵\"。如果你用（4%）或（5%）打仗，你就被称为 \"魔杖客\"。",

If so, do you display it prominently? Do you carry your {@item fernian ash wand|ERLW|wand of Fernian ash} with pride, twirling it and doing flame tricks? If so, you're a wandslinger.

	"Since NPCs don't follow the same rules as player characters and player characters are exceptional, the DM may decide that an NPC wandslinger needs an arcane focus in order to cast a spell. Player characters are versatile; it's useful for you to have a wand, but you can work around its absence. The typical arcane dragoon needs a wand, rod, or staff in order to cast a spell or cantrip. Here are a few examples of NPC wandslingers:": "由于NPC不遵循与玩家角色相同的规则，而且玩家角色是例外的，所以DM可以决定NPC魔杖手需要一个奥术焦点才能施法。玩家角色是多面手；你有一根魔杖是很有用的，但你可以绕过它的缺失。典型的奥术龙人需要一根魔杖、棒子或法杖，以便施展法术或咒语。这里有几个NPC使用魔杖的例子。",

	"While wandslingers are becoming more commonplace, at the moment this is still an elite specialty. By adding wandslinger capabilities to a standard stat block, such as a guard, you are reflecting specialized training, much like a player character acquiring a feat. If you want to add more national flavor to current or former soldiers, you can add different feats to a stat block. Thrane is known for its archers; if you want to represent an elite Thrane archer, you could use the scout stat block but add the benefits of the {@feat Sharpshooter} feat. Karrnath fielded exceptional heavy infantry, and a Karrnathi knight could gain the benefits of {@feat Heavy Armor Master}.": "虽然魔杖手正变得越来越普遍，但目前这仍然是一个精英专业。通过将巫师的能力添加到一个标准的状态块中，比如说一个卫兵，你就反映了专门的训练，就像玩家角色获得一个壮举。如果你想给现在或以前的士兵添加更多的国家色彩，你可以在一个状态块中添加不同的功绩。瑟兰以其弓箭手而闻名；如果你想表现一个精锐的瑟兰弓箭手，你可以使用侦察兵的状态块，但要加上{@feat Sharpshooter}的壮举的好处。卡尔纳特（Karrnath）的重装步兵非常出色，一个卡尔纳特的骑士可以获得（%1%）的好处。",
	"As Aundair expanded the use of arcane dragoons, it saw the need for spells that could match the range of the Thrane archers, or bring down large numbers of peasant levies. {@spell Force blast|ExploringEberron} is a simple spell that lacks the offensive punch of a {@spell fire bolt}, but has greater range than a longbow and a rarely resisted damage type. {@spell Concussive burst|ExploringEberron} isn't as deadly as {@spell burning hands} or {@spell thunderwave}, but it covers the same area as a {@spell fireball} while being accessible to a wandslinger. These spells may not appeal to player characters, but you could find them in the hands of enemy wandslingers.": "随着昂代尔扩大了对奥术龙骑兵的使用，它看到了对能与瑟兰弓箭手的射程相匹配的法术的需求，或者说能打倒大量农民军的法术。{@spell Force blast|ExploringEberron}是一种简单的法术，缺乏{@spell fire bolt}的攻击力，但比长弓的射程更大，而且是一种很少被抵抗的伤害类型。{@spell Concussive burst|ExploringEberron}不像{@spell burning hands}或{@spell thunderwave}那样致命，但它覆盖的范围与{@spell fireball}相同，同时也能让魔杖手接触到。这些法术可能对玩家角色没有吸引力，但你可以在敌人的巫师手中找到它们。",
	"The wandslinger is trained to use an arcane focus: the power isn't in the wand, it's simply a tool for channeling a spell. But what of magic wands, staffs, and rods? Under the wide-magic principles of Eberron, common and uncommon items are part of the magical industry; rare items are exotic and expensive; and very rare and legendary items are largely beyond the capabilities of Cannith and the Arcane Congress. As such, weapons such as a {@item wand of fireballs} or {@item wand of lightning bolts} could be found on the battlefield, especially when dealing with Aundair, but they were rare, only assigned to elite units and critical operations.": "魔杖手接受了使用奥术焦点的训练：力量不在魔杖里，它只是一个引导咒语的工具。但是魔杖、法杖和棒子呢？在Eberron的广泛魔法原则下，普通和不普通的物品是魔法产业的一部分；稀有物品是异国情调和昂贵的；而非常稀有和传奇的物品基本上超出了Cannith和奥术大会的能力。因此，像{@item wand of fireballs}或{@item wand of lightning bolts}这样的武器可以在战场上找到，特别是在对付昂代尔的时候，但它们很罕见，只分配给精英部队和关键行动。",
	"However, House Cannith and Aundair's Arcane Congress are always working to produce more efficient weapons, and the {@item wand of magic missiles} is one such recent development. Prior versions of the wand were more expensive, could only be used by trained spellcasters, or didn't regain charges. The {@item wand of magic missiles} breaks this barrier: it's an uncommon magic item that doesn't require attunement and can be used by any creature. A wealthy wandslinger could carry a brace of wands, unleashing a barrage of bolts from a new wand each round. {@item Wands of magic missiles} may be found in the hands of criminal enforcers, royal guards, or any number of other professionals, and can potentially be purchased across the Five Nations. However, they were perfected by the Arcane Congress just twelve years ago, and House Cannith has yet to replicate that technique. As a result, these wands are primarily found in Aundair or used by Aundairians; a wand being sold in Sharn may be surplus or salvage recovered from Aundairian soldiers during the war.": "然而，坎尼斯家族和昂代尔的奥术大会一直在努力生产更有效的武器，{@item wand of magic missiles}就是这样的一个最新发展。之前的魔杖版本比较昂贵，只能由训练有素的施法者使用，或者不能恢复充电。1%）打破了这一障碍：它是一种不常见的魔法物品，不需要调谐，任何生物都可以使用。一个富有的魔杖手可以带着一串魔杖，每回合从一个新的魔杖中释放出一连串的子弹。{@item Wands of magic missiles}可能会出现在犯罪执行者、皇家卫队或任何其他专业人士的手中，并有可能在整个五国买到。然而，它们是由奥术大会在十二年前完善的，而坎尼斯家族还没有复制这种技术。因此，这些魔杖主要在昂代尔发现，或者由昂代尔人使用；在沙恩出售的魔杖可能是战争期间从昂代尔士兵那里回收的剩余或残余物。",
	"Sooner or later House Cannith will duplicate this item and they'll become available at any Cannith enclave. But for now, these wands can still be difficult to find outside Aundair.": "坎尼斯家族迟早会复制这种物品，它们会在任何一个坎尼斯的飞地都能买到。但现在，这些魔杖在昂代尔之外仍然很难找到。",
	"Throughout the Last War, Cyre poured gold into House Cannith's coffers, urging them to develop ever-deadlier weapons. In 959 YK, Cannith presented Queen Dannel with the first warforged titans. For a time, this gave Cyre an edge—but as always, Cannith began selling these creations to other nations, as well as selling {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} and {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs} to those who needed to fight titans.": "在整个最后一次战争中，赛尔将黄金注入坎尼斯家族的库房，敦促他们开发更多的致命武器。在公元959年，坎尼斯向丹妮尔女王展示了第一批战争锻造的泰坦巨人。一时间，这给赛尔带来了优势--但像往常一样，坎尼斯开始向其他国家出售这些作品，同时也向那些需要与泰坦战斗的人出售（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"During the Last War, the warforged titan served a number of critical roles. The mere presence of an imposing titan provided a defensive bulwark for infantry, as enemy infantry could rarely afford to engage a titan without artillery or magical support. Titans are tireless, surprisingly swift, and capable of crossing almost any terrain. Thanks to the Siege Monster ability, they are also devastatingly effective against fortifications and siege engines.": "在最后的战争中，战争锻造的泰坦有许多关键作用。一个强大的泰坦的存在为步兵提供了一个防御堡垒，因为敌人的步兵很少能在没有火炮或魔法支持的情况下与泰坦作战。泰坦是不知疲倦的，令人惊讶的迅速，并且能够穿越几乎所有的地形。得益于围攻怪物的能力，它们对防御工事和攻城引擎也有毁灭性的效果。",
	"The statistics of a basic warforged titan, as described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, grant it additional versatility from its Platforms trait. A titan has two platforms in its chassis, each designed to hold one medium or smaller creature. Typically, these platforms hold archers, providing the warforged with some minimal ranged support to complement its powerful melee attacks. However, specialized crew can dramatically increase the capabilities of a titan: an evoker can provide strong ranged attacks, while an abjurer can stand ready to counter or dispel enemy magic, and an onboard artificer can keep the titan operational. Sending your titan against Karrnathi undead? An exorcist can be a boon for dealing with undead. Alternatively, a titan could simply serve as a battering ram, carrying two spies or commandos ready to leap off and blend into an enemy community as soon as the titan breaches a defensive wall.": "如同{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}所述，基本的战神泰坦的统计资料，从它的平台特质中赋予了它额外的多功能性。泰坦的底盘上有两个平台，每个平台可以容纳一个中型或小型生物。一般来说，这些平台可以容纳弓箭手，为战神提供一些最低限度的远程支持，以补充其强大的近战攻击。然而，专门的船员可以极大地提高泰坦的能力：一个唤醒者可以提供强大的远程攻击，而一个堕落者可以随时准备反击或驱散敌人的魔法，而船上的工匠可以保持泰坦的运作。派你的泰坦去对付卡尔纳特的亡灵？驱魔师可以成为对付亡灵的利器。另外，泰坦可以简单地充当攻城车，携带两名间谍或突击队员，准备在泰坦突破防御墙后立即跳下，混入敌人社区。",
	"While the warforged titan stat block represents the basic design, over the course of nearly forty years in service, there were many variations on that design. Consider using one of these options as a way to add flavor to a titan.": "虽然战神泰坦的属性块代表了基本的设计，但在近四十年的服役过程中，这个设计有很多变化。考虑使用这些选项中的一个，作为增加泰坦的风味的一种方式。",
	"One of the titan's weapons can be replaced with an integrated ballista. This weapon is self-loading and conjures ammunition. If the titan has an armbow, replace either the axehand or hammerfist with the following attack:": "泰坦的一种武器可以被替换成综合弹弓。这种武器可以自动装弹，并能变出弹药。如果泰坦有一个臂弓，用以下的攻击方式取代斧手或锤拳。",

	"Late in the war, Cannith developed titans that had only one platform, with a {@object long rod|ExploringEberron} (as described in the \"Arcane Artillery\" section) integrated in place of the other platform.": "在战争后期，坎尼斯开发了只有一个平台的泰坦巨人，在另一个平台的位置上集成了一个（%0%）（如 \"奥术火炮 \"部分所述）。",
	"Titans serving in particular regions were often shielded against a relevant type of elemental damage. For example, force and fire were the damage types most typically tied to {@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks} or {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs}, so Cannith often designed titans with resistance to one of these damage types.": "在特定地区服役的泰坦常常被屏蔽在相关类型的元素伤害之外。例如，力和火是最典型的与{@item blast disk|ExploringEberron|blast disks}或{@object siege staff|ExploringEberron|siege staffs}相关的伤害类型，所以坎尼斯在设计泰坦时经常对这些伤害类型之一进行抵抗。",
	"The titan has a hollow space within its chassis and can carry up to 6 Medium creatures or extra cargo. Due to the loss of body mass, a model made for transport only has an Armor Class of 18 and 100 hit points, but increases its walking speed to 45 feet.": "泰坦的底盘内有一个中空的空间，最多可以携带6个中型生物或额外的货物。由于身体质量的损失，为运输而制造的模型只有18的装甲等级和100的命中率，但将其行走速度提高到45英尺。",
	"While called \"warforged,\" the titans are quite different from the truly living constructs that came after them. Titans have limited sentience. They imprint on their commanders, and to a lesser degree, on the uniforms of their allies. They can follow orders and general instructions such as \"protect allies\" or \"engage enemies.\" But as a rule, titans don't feel emotion, reflected by the fact that they're immune to being charmed or frightened. Today, most remaining titans are simply waiting in storage, content to remain motionless until it's time to serve again.": "虽然被称为 \"战神\"，但泰坦与他们之后的真正的生命体有很大不同。泰坦拥有有限的知觉。他们在指挥官身上留下印记，在较小的程度上，在他们的盟友的制服上留下印记。它们可以服从命令和一般指令，如 \"保护盟友 \"或 \"与敌人交战\"。但通常情况下，泰坦巨人不会感受到情感，这体现在他们对被迷惑或被惊吓是免疫的。今天，大多数剩余的泰坦只是在仓库里等待，满足于保持不动，直到再次服务的时间。",
	"Yet there are stories of titans who've developed full consciousness. If the tales are true, this could be the result of rogue artificers (possibly cultists of the Traveler hidden within House Cannith), or it could be a random spark of evolution—suggesting that the potential for sentience lies within all titans.": "然而，有一些关于泰坦巨人发展出完整意识的故事。如果这些故事是真的，这可能是流氓工匠（可能是隐藏在坎尼斯家族中的旅行者的崇拜者）的结果，也可能是进化的随机火花--暗示着所有泰坦都有潜在的智慧。",
	"A sentient titan loses its immunity to psychic damage. It's no longer immune to being frightened or charmed, but it has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause these conditions. Its Intelligence increases to 10 (or higher) and it is capable of making its own decisions.": "有知觉的泰坦失去了对精神伤害的免疫力。它不再对被惊吓或被迷惑有免疫力，但它对造成这些情况的效果有救命的优势。它的智力增加到10（或更高），并且能够做出自己的决定。",

	"There are challenges facing every society, problems that need to be solved. Communication. Transportation. Even entertainment. In Khorvaire, magic is the tool people use to solve these problems.

	"The Five Nations are built on a foundation of magical tools and services. Arcane magic is understood to be a form of science: anyone with the aptitude for it can train at a house trade school to become a magewright or learn how to be a wandslinger. There's nothing strange about seeing an airship in the sky or sending a message to a distant friend using a {@item speaking stone|ERLW}.": "五国是建立在魔法工具和服务的基础上的。奥术魔法被理解为一种科学形式：任何有这方面才能的人都可以在房屋贸易学校接受培训，成为一名魔法师，或者学习如何成为一名魔杖手。在天空中看到一艘飞艇，或者用{@item speaking stone|ERLW}给远方的朋友发送消息，这并不奇怪。",
	"However, a common maxim about Khorvaire is that it possesses \"wide magic, not high magic.\" While the {@item speaking stone|ERLW} allows you to send messages between two stone stations, {@spell sending} is a rarer service that fewer people can afford. {@spell Lesser restoration} is available at any good Jorasco healing house, but {@spell raise dead} isn't so trivial.": "然而，关于霍尔韦尔的一句常见格言是，它拥有 \"广泛的魔法，而不是高超的魔法\"。虽然{@item speaking stone|ERLW}可以让你在两个石站之间发送消息，但{@spell sending}是一种比较罕见的服务，很少有人能负担得起。{@spell Lesser restoration}在任何好的乔拉斯科治疗所都可以得到，但{@spell raise dead}就不是那么微不足道了。",
	"As a broad rule, the people of Khorvaire are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or spells of 1st and 2nd level. They're familiar with 3rd-level spells—{@spell fireball||fireballs} on the battlefield, aristocrats using Sivis {@spell sending} services—but these things are expensive. Effects of 4th or 5th level are known—Orien maintains a network of teleportation circles, the dead can be raised, an oracle can cast {@spell divination}—but these things aren't part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn't expect to run into them. Magical effects of 6th level or higher are usually the product of more advanced civilizations—the dragons of Argonnessen, the elves of Aerenal, the ancient giants of Xen'drik. The same principle applies to magic items. Common and uncommon items are part of everyday life. Rare items exist, but they're rare. And very rare and legendary items are typically the product of advanced civilizations or remarkable events.": "作为一项广泛的规则，Khorvaire的人们习惯于与那些模仿一、二级咒语或法术的工具和服务打交道。他们熟悉三级法术--{@spell fireball||fireballs}在战场上，贵族们使用Sivis{@spell sending}服务--但这些东西都很昂贵。四级或五级的效果是已知的--奥利安维持着一个传送圈网络，死人可以复活，神谕者可以施展（%2%）--但这些东西并不是日常生活的一部分，一般的平民不会期望碰到它们。六级以上的魔法效果通常是更先进的文明的产物--阿贡尼森的龙，艾瑞纳的精灵，Xen'drik的古代巨人。同样的原则也适用于魔法物品。普通和不普通的物品是日常生活的一部分。稀有物品存在，但它们很罕见。而非常稀有和传奇的物品通常是先进文明或非凡事件的产物。",
	"There are exceptions to this rule. There are higher-level spellcasters in the world: Mordain the Fleshweaver, Jaela Daran, the Great Druid Oalian. But civilization is built on a foundation of common and uncommon items, and spells of 3rd level and below. High-level spellcasters are capable of remarkable feats, but these can't yet be mass produced.": "这条规则也有例外。世界上有更高级别的施法者。编肉者莫尔丹、杰拉-达兰、大德鲁伊-奥里安。但文明是建立在普通和不普通的物品以及3级及以下法术的基础上的。高级别的法术师能够做出非凡的功绩，但这些还不能大规模生产。",
	"Common magic items are common throughout Khorvaire. This isn't to say they are trivial—{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} sets the price of a common magic item at {@dice 2d4*10|2d4 × 10} gp, so even the simplest item will cost 20 gp. A farmer might treasure her {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} and the gown of {@item clothes of mending|XGE} that has been in her family for generations, while a wealthy young noble may flaunt his {@item glamerweave|ERLW} and {@item cloak of many fashions|XGE}.": "普通魔法物品在整个Khorvaire都很常见。这并不是说它们是微不足道的--{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}规定普通魔法物品的价格为{@dice 2d4*10|2d4 × 10}gp，所以即使是最简单的物品也要花费20gp。一个农民可能会珍惜她的{@item everbright lantern|ERLW}和她家世代相传的{@item clothes of mending|XGE}的长袍，而一个富有的年轻贵族可能会炫耀他的{@item glamerweave|ERLW}和{@item cloak of many fashions|XGE}。",
	"Common magic items generally aren't all sold in one place. A high-class tailor will sell both mundane and magical clothes, but you can't buy an everbright lantern at their shop.

	"Beyond this, consider that both in price and description, there's a wide range of quality between items, reflected in the range of price. A 20 gp {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} is ugly but functional, while for 80 gp you can get one inlaid with beautiful patterns, and you might even be able to adjust the shade and brilliance of the light source. {@item Glamerweave|ERLW} is clothing that's been imbued with illusions: both the quality of the base clothing and the illusion factor into the cost, and the finest glamerweave can be far more than 80 gp. In short, the magic item description tells you what a common item {@i does}, but it's also an object beyond that, and it's good to think about its form and quality.": "除此之外，考虑到无论是价格还是描述，物品之间的质量差异很大，反映在价格范围上。一个20戈比（%0%）的东西很丑，但很实用，而花80戈比就可以得到一个镶嵌着美丽图案的东西，你甚至可以调整光源的阴影和亮度。(1%)是被注入了幻觉的衣服：基本衣服的质量和幻觉都是成本的考虑因素，而最好的冰晶织品可能远远超过80戈比。简而言之，魔法物品描述告诉你什么是普通物品（%2%），但它也是一个超出这个范围的物品，考虑一下它的形式和质量是很好的。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} only calls out common magic items, but at the DM's discretion, uncommon magic items can also be purchased in major cities (especially in Aundair). Such items are more expensive—the price is typically between 200-500 gp, set by the DM based on the power and quality of the item—but selection will be far more limited. Just because you could theoretically purchase a {@item cloak of protection} doesn't mean one is always available in that particular shop or town. However, an exceptional weaponsmith may have a {@item +1 weapon} for sale or take a commission to create one, and large House Sivis enclaves often sell {@item sending stones}. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide what sort of uncommon magic items are available and who is selling them.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}只叫出了常见的魔法物品，但根据DM的决定，不常见的魔法物品也可以在主要城市（尤其是在Aundair）购买。这类物品更加昂贵--价格通常在200-500戈比之间，由DM根据物品的威力和质量来确定--但选择也会更加有限。理论上你能买到（1%）并不意味着在那个特定的商店或城镇里总能买到。然而，一个出色的武器匠可能会有一个{@item +1 weapon}出售，或者接受委托制造一个，而大型的西维斯家族飞地经常出售{@item sending stones}。归根结底，要由DM来决定什么样的不常见的魔法物品是可用的，以及谁在出售它们。",
	"Chapter 7 includes a list of dragonmark focus items. These represent that it's easier to create an item that can only be used by someone with a dragonmark—presenting focus versions of other magic items, but with a reduced rarity. Dragonmark focus items can only be created by a character with the Mark of Making or the dragonmark used by the item; while they are more common than similar items that work for unmarked characters, they are typically only available through the dragonmarked houses and often only as rewards for house service.": "第七章包括一份龙纹重点物品的清单。这些物品代表着更容易创造出只有拥有龙纹的人才能使用的物品--呈现出其他魔法物品的焦点版本，但稀有度降低。龙纹聚焦物品只能由拥有制造印记或物品所使用的龙纹的角色创造；虽然它们比对无印记的角色有效的类似物品更常见，但它们通常只能通过有龙纹的家族获得，而且往往只能作为家族服务的奖励。",
	"Most magic items are portable and designed for adventurers. However, you may also encounter magic items that are meant for industrial use. Just as a dragonmark focus item is easier to create because of its limitations, a large, immovable industrial item can make a rare or uncommon item's properties accessible to the public. An Aundairian village may have a large {@item cleansing stone|ERLW} set into the town square. If a theater has a magical tool that can generate {@spell minor illusion||minor illusions}, it could be similar in size and shape to a pipe organ. Essentially, in thinking about the magical items that people may encounter, keep in mind that they aren't necessarily designed for use in adventuring!": "大多数魔法物品都是便携式的，为冒险者设计。然而，你也可能遇到为工业用途设计的魔法物品。就像龙纹重点物品因其局限性而更容易创造一样，一个大型的、不可移动的工业物品可以使一个稀有或不常见的物品的属性为公众所了解。一个Aundairian村庄可能有一个大型的（%0%）设置在城镇广场。如果一个剧院有一个能产生（%1%）的魔法工具，它的大小和形状可能与管风琴相似。基本上，在思考人们可能遇到的魔法物品时，请记住它们不一定是为了在冒险中使用而设计的!",
	"The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the {@creature magewright|ERLW|magewrights}: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright knows few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they're able to cast them in ways others cannot.": "Eberron的魔法经济是建立在{@creature magewright|ERLW|magewrights}的基础上的：那些知道少数几个咒语或仪式的施法者，使他们能够提供重要的服务。巫师是出类拔萃的；他们通过几个小时的学习就能准备好任何法术，这反映了他们非凡的天赋和多才多艺。相比之下，魔法师知道的法术很少，但由于他们对这些法术的强烈关注，他们能够以其他人无法做到的方式施展这些法术。",
	"An artificer is equally exceptional. Most of the people assembling magic items at Cannith forgeholds aren't artificers; they work using industrialized processes, massive tools that enhance the creation process (like the {@i creation forge}), and house resources. These craftspeople couldn't just create a wand at home alone. By contrast, as an artificer, you are unconventional, using personalized techniques and improvising solutions.": "一个工匠同样是个例外。在Cannith锻造厂组装魔法物品的大多数人都不是工匠；他们使用工业化的流程、增强创造过程的大型工具（比如（%0%））和房屋资源来工作。这些工匠不可能只在家里单独创造一根魔杖。相比之下，作为一个工匠，你是非常规的，使用个性化的技术和即兴的解决方案。",
	"Just because {@i you} can create any common magic item with little time and effort doesn't mean that this is typical or that others could duplicate your work. Never forget that in Eberron, {@i player characters are exceptional}. Even at low levels, you have potential that the common magewright can't match. There are also exceptional NPCs, ones who can do things player characters cannot; but remember that as a player character, not everyone who follows your path can match your abilities.": "仅仅因为{@i you}可以用很少的时间和精力创造任何普通的魔法物品，并不意味着这是典型的，或者其他人可以复制你的工作。永远不要忘记，在Eberron，（%1%）。即使在低级别的情况下，你也有普通魔法师无法比拟的潜力。也有出类拔萃的NPC，那些能做到玩家角色无法做到的事情；但请记住，作为一个玩家角色，并不是每个追随你的人都能与你的能力相媲美。",
	"For simplicity's sake, magewrights cast spells from the existing spell lists. But magewright spells are unique in a few ways. First of all, magewrights cast all their spells as rituals—even spells that don't normally have the ritual tag. The drawback is that they can only be cast as rituals with an extended casting time. All magewright spells have a minimum casting time of 10 minutes, and the DM can choose to give a spell an even longer casting time; it may take a medium a full hour to cast {@spell speak with dead}.": "为了简单起见，魔法师从现有的法术列表中施展法术。但魔法师的法术在几个方面是独特的。首先，魔法师把他们所有的法术都当作仪式来施放--即使是那些通常没有仪式标签的法术。缺点是，它们只能作为有延长施法时间的仪式来施放。所有魔法师的法术都有至少10分钟的施法时间，而DM可以选择给一个法术更长的施法时间；它可能需要一个中等人整整一个小时来施法（%0%）。",
	"As magewrights can only cast spells as rituals, they don't use spell slots. But they do require a surge of magical energy to power the spell, typically generated by refined Eberron dragonshards, the fuel of arcane industry.": "由于魔法师只能以仪式的形式施展法术，他们不使用法术槽。但他们确实需要大量的魔法能量来驱动咒语，这些能量通常由精炼的艾伯伦龙石产生，是奥术工业的燃料。",
	"When a magewright performs a ritual, it consumes an amount of Eberron dragonshards worth 20 gp × the spell's level, in addition to any costly material components of the spell. This is the cost to the magewright to cast the spell; they might charge far more for offering that service to others, generally at least twice the casting cost. Following the general limitations of everyday magic, it's unusual to encounter a magewright that can cast a spell of 4th level or higher, and any such magewright would likely charge a significant premium for their services.": "当一个魔法师执行一个仪式时，除了法术中任何昂贵的物质成分外，它还会消耗价值为20gp×法术等级的Eberron龙石。这是魔法师施法的成本；他们为他人提供服务时可能会收取更多的费用，通常至少是施法成本的两倍。按照日常魔法的一般限制，能施放四级或更高级别的法术的魔法师并不多见，任何这样的魔法师都可能为他们的服务收取相当高的费用。",
	"Here are two new cantrips you might find employed by a magewright, other NPC, or player character in Khorvaire.": "这里有两个新的咒语，你可能会发现魔法师、其他NPC或玩家角色在霍尔韦尔使用的咒语。",
	"At DM discretion, a magewright's spells may have expanded—or limited—effects. Consider what it takes to make a spell a viable commercial service. For example, {@spell augury} only allows the caster to predict events 30 minutes in the future—useful for adventurers in the midst of a dungeon, but not for the farmer wanting an opinion on planting crops. A professional oracle might be able to predict woe or weal anywhere from a day to a week in advance—but such an oracle could have very specific limitations, such as only being able to make predictions related to weather or agriculture. As a DM, use the existing spells as a model, but adjust them as necessary to create a viable business.": "根据DM的决定，魔法师的法术可以有扩大的或有限的效果。考虑如何才能使一个法术成为可行的商业服务。例如，{@spell augury}只允许施法者预测未来30分钟内的事件--这对在地牢中的冒险者来说是有用的，但对想要对种植庄稼提出意见的农民来说就不是了。一个专业的神谕者也许能够提前一天到一周预测祸福，但这样的神谕者可能有非常具体的限制，比如只能预测与天气或农业有关的事情。作为DM，使用现有的法术作为模型，但要根据需要进行调整，以创建一个可行的企业。",
	"Player characters can't duplicate these effects. The unique aspects of magewright spells reflect both their devotion to a single subject and personal aptitude; the oracle has a unique talent for divination that even a diviner wizard can't replicate. Player characters have unmatched potential and great versatility; magewrights are extremely limited, but have unique advantages.": "玩家角色无法复制这些效果。魔法师法术的独特之处，既反映了他们对单一主题的奉献，也反映了个人的能力；神谕者在占卜方面有独特的天赋，即使是占卜师的巫师也无法复制。玩家角色具有无可比拟的潜力和极大的通用性；魔法师的能力极其有限，但却有独特的优势。",
	"In Aerenal, almost every citizen knows a few cantrips. The Five Nations aren't quite so advanced; there, cantrips are common, but still reflect specialized training. Most people rely on common magic items; a magewright can be proud of their talents, though just as magewrights have a narrow spell selection, their cantrips are also more limited than those used by player characters. A magewright chef uses effects similar to {@spell prestidigitation} to heat and flavor food, but they can't conjure illusions or extinguish flames. The idea is that the most versatile cantrips—such as {@spell prestidigitation} and {@spell thaumaturgy}—represent knowledge of a range of discrete spell effects, all categorized under one greater cantrip. Your spell list merely says {@spell prestidigitation}, but that encompasses a host of lesser cantrips; when you extinguish a fire, you're actually casting {@i incendiary purge}, and when you chill your drink, you're performing {@i culinary transmutation}. While this has no effect on player characters, consider that magewrights and other lesser spellcasters might only know limited forms of common cantrips, such as the following:": "在Aerenal，几乎每个公民都知道一些咒语。五国并不那么先进；在那里，咒语很常见，但仍然反映了专门的训练。大多数人都依赖普通的魔法物品；魔法师可以为自己的才能感到自豪，不过就像魔法师的法术选择很窄一样，他们的咒语也比玩家角色使用的咒语更有限。魔法师的厨师使用类似于（%0%）的效果来加热和调味食物，但他们不能施展幻术或熄灭火焰。我们的想法是，最通用的咒语--比如{@spell prestidigitation}和{@spell thaumaturgy}--代表了一系列不连续的法术效果的知识，都被归入一个更大的咒语。你的法术清单上只写着（%3%），但这包含了一系列较小的咒语；当你灭火时，你实际上是在施放（%4%），而当你冷却饮料时，你在执行（%5%）。虽然这对玩家角色没有影响，但考虑到魔法师和其他较低级的施法者可能只知道普通咒语的有限形式，比如说以下这些。",

	"Magewrights weave magic into their work. They are not only limited spellcasters, but skilled professionals who use magic as a tool. In addition to a limited range of magic ability, magewrights are also skilled in the mundane aspects of their specialty. A magewright chef doesn't make food by snapping their fingers; they're skilled with cook's utensils, as well as using {@i culinary transmutation} and {@i Zolan zest} as tools in their repertoire. Below are a few examples of magewright professions.": "魔法师将魔法编织到他们的工作中。他们不仅是有限的施法者，而且是将魔法作为一种工具的熟练的专业人员。除了有限的魔法能力之外，魔法师还精通他们专业的世俗方面。魔法师的厨师不是靠打响指就能做出食物的；他们熟练使用厨具，以及使用（%0%）和（%1%）作为他们剧目中的工具。以下是几个关于魔法师职业的例子。",

	"No dragonmarked house trains mediums. Instead, some come from communities steeped in the Blood of Vol, while others are Vassals who invoke Aureon and the Keeper. A medium performs {@spell speak with dead} as a ritual, and many use a form of {@spell minor illusion} to conjure up an image of the deceased in conjunction with the ritual. Some less-scrupulous mediums rely on {@skill Insight}, {@spell History}, or {@spell Deception} to simulate speaking with the dead without going through the full ritual.": "没有龙纹屋会训练媒介。相反，有些人来自于深受沃尔之血影响的社区，而有些人则是召唤奥瑞恩和守护者的附庸。灵媒将{@spell speak with dead}作为一种仪式来执行，许多人在仪式中使用{@spell minor illusion}的形式来召唤出死者的形象。一些不那么狡猾的灵媒依靠（%2%）、（%3%）或（%4%）来模拟与死者对话，而不经过完整的仪式。",

	"Licensed by the Warning Guild of House Medani, truthtellers are proficient in {@skill Insight} and can cast {@spell zone of truth} as a ritual.

	"Arcane magic is a science—magewrights master its techniques. However, there are other forms of magic which can likewise be adapted to everyday functions. An adept derives their magic from their faith, a more limited form of what a cleric can do; similarly, a gleaner masters the simplest forms of druidic magic. Especially with the adept, this is more of a calling than a job; you don't decide to become an oracle of Aureon, you find that you are gifted with visions. The rituals of an adept invoke divine forces, while a gleaner draws on the world around them and often uses an herbalism kit as a spellcasting focus. Adepts are common in Thrane and other religious communities, while gleaners provide useful services in the Eldeen Reaches.": "奥术魔法是一门科学--魔法师们掌握着它的技术。然而，还有其他形式的魔法也同样可以适应日常功能。精通者的魔法来自于他们的信仰，是牧师所能做到的更有限的形式；同样，拾荒者掌握最简单形式的德鲁伊魔法。特别是对行者来说，这更像是一种召唤而非工作；你不是决定要成为奥瑞恩的神谕，而是发现自己有幻觉的天赋。精通者的仪式会调用神圣的力量，而拾荒者则会利用他们周围的世界，并经常使用草药包作为施法的重点。精通者在瑟恩和其他宗教团体中很常见，而拾荒者则在Eldeen Reaches提供有用的服务。",
	"The people of Eberron don't use mechanical clocks, and if you're in a Mror mine or the heart of one of Sharn's towers, you can't see the sun. So how do you tell time?": "Eberron的人们不使用机械钟，如果你在Moror矿区或Sharn的一个塔楼的中心，你就看不到太阳。那么，你是如何计算时间的呢？",
	"The answer is simple: magic. There are a wide range of cantrips that tell time—some tied to an absolute time, some tied to the moons, some set to a local time. In Eberron, any character that has the skill to cast {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell thaumaturgy}, or {@spell druidcraft} can produce an additional effect allowing them to tell time. Clocks in Eberron are common magic items, and in most major cities, bells are rung to identify the hour; three bells means \"three o'clock.\" An {@item orb of time|XGE} is another common magic item—a small polished stone disk, often connected to a chain like a pocket watch—that tells time.": "答案很简单：魔法。有各种各样的咒语可以显示时间，有些与绝对时间有关，有些与月亮有关，有些与当地时间有关。在Eberron，任何拥有施放{@spell prestidigitation}、{@spell thaumaturgy}或{@spell druidcraft}技能的角色都可以产生一个额外的效果，使他们能够判断时间。在艾伯伦，时钟是常见的魔法物品，在大多数大城市，钟声会被敲响以确定时间；三个钟声意味着 \"三点钟\"。{@item orb of time|XGE}是另一种常见的魔法物品--一个打磨过的小石盘，通常像怀表一样与一条链子相连，可以显示时间。",

	"Most theaters employ illusions to add special effects to a performance, whether provided by magewrights or static items. Dream parlors provide entirely illusory entertainment. House Phiarlan's latest innovation is the {@i crystal theater}. A large device uses a tiny scrying crystal to project an image on a screen. The crystal is tied to a single location—one of the grand stages in House Phiarlan's central demesnes. This allows the patrons of a crystal theater to watch a live performance occurring on a distant stage. As this practice expands, this could provide entertainers and bards with a global reach; Phiarlan might even pay adventurers to license the rights to dramatize their exploits.": "大多数剧院都采用幻觉来为表演增加特殊效果，无论是由魔术师还是静态物品提供。梦幻厅则提供完全虚幻的娱乐。皮亚伦家族的最新创新是（%0%）。一个大型设备使用一个微小的窥探水晶在屏幕上投射出一个图像。水晶被绑在一个单一的位置--菲亚尔兰家族中央领地的大舞台。这使得水晶剧院的观众可以观看到远处舞台上发生的现场表演。随着这种做法的扩大，这可以为艺人和吟游诗人提供全球范围的影响；Phiarlan甚至可以付钱给冒险家，让他们授权将自己的事迹戏剧化。",
	"One form of fashion that hasn't been discussed in depth is the practice of {@i cosmetic transmutation}. A magewright beautician can perform a range of minor transformations—for a price. Minor cosmetic transmutation is quite common; most professional beauticians can change your hair or eye color. Unnatural effects are rarer, seen mainly in Aundair and Zilargo; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in Fairhaven, and in the days before Galifar, the nobles of Thaliost would adopt elf features. The effects of cosmetic transmutation typically last a week, but if you're dealing with a magewright of sufficient skill, you can extend the effect to one month. In some cities, you might even find an expert who can make the change permanent. The more complicated the transmutation, the more costly—and hard to find—the service becomes.": "一种还没有被深入讨论的时尚形式是（%0%）的做法。 小规模的美容改造是很常见的；大多数专业美容师可以改变你的头发或眼睛的颜色。非自然的效果比较少见，主要出现在昂代尔和齐拉尔戈；金属发色是费尔海文最近的流行趋势，在加利法尔之前的日子里，塔利奥斯特的贵族们会采用精灵的特征。化妆品转化的效果通常会持续一周，但如果你面对的是一个有足够技能的魔法师，你可以将效果延长到一个月。在一些城市，你甚至可以找到一个专家，他可以使变化永久化。改造越复杂，服务就越昂贵，也越难找到。",

However, the standard fare is 2 sp per mile, which is modest to comfortable in its appointments. Those on a budget can book passage in steerage for only 2 cp per mile, but this is typically squalid or poor in quality, and a long journey can be dangerous.

	"Manifest zones are areas where the influence of the other planes bleeds through into the Material Plane. {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} presents some possible manifest zone effects, and chapter 5 of this book explores these in more depth. Some manifest zones are dangerous, and such regions are shunned. However, other manifest zones have effects that can be quite useful for commerce or industry, and like any natural resource, these tend to be harnessed over time. The towers of Sharn are made possible by the manifest zone to Syrania, and any other city with a similar zone could support skycoaches and high towers. Lamannian manifest zones often promote fertility and growth, and many of the greatest farms and vineyards in Khorvaire are in such zones. Ultimately, this is one more factor in the wide magic of Khorvaire: it's not simply what spells can be cast, it's that there are places in the world itself that are inherently magical.": "显化区是其他位面的影响渗入物质位面的区域。{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}介绍了一些可能的显灵区效应，本书第五章对这些效应进行了更深入的探讨。有些显灵区是危险的，这样的区域被避开了。然而，其他显化区的效果对商业或工业相当有用，就像任何自然资源一样，这些效果往往会随着时间的推移而被利用起来。沙恩的塔楼是由通往西拉尼亚的显露区实现的，任何其他拥有类似显露区的城市都可以支持空中客车和高塔。拉曼尼亚的显露区经常促进肥沃和增长，霍尔韦尔许多最伟大的农场和葡萄园都在这样的区域。归根结底，这是霍尔韦尔广泛的魔力的又一个因素：这不是简单的可以施展什么法术，而是世界上有些地方本身就有魔力。",
	"Arcane magic is a science. Wizards use words of power and mystic gestures, but there are many ways to channel arcane energies—suspended in the liquid of a potion, trapped in the sigils of a scroll, or focused through a wand.": "奥术魔法是一门科学。巫师们使用力量的语言和神秘的手势，但有许多方法可以引导奥术能量--悬浮在药水的液体中，被困在卷轴的符号中，或通过魔杖集中。",
	"The artificer is an arcane engineer; instead of working directly with mystical energy, they use tools to perform wonders. In a world where wandslingers take to the battlefields and airships sail through the skies, artificers are innovators and inventors developing tools to shape the future. Chapter 6 presents two new artificer subclasses and a number of infusions, representing the diversity of artifice styles and specializations.": "工匠是一个神秘的工程师；他们不直接使用神秘的能量，而是使用工具来创造奇迹。在一个巫师走上战场、飞艇在天空中航行的世界中，工匠是创新者和发明家，他们开发工具来塑造未来。第6章介绍了两个新的工匠子类和一些灌注，代表了工匠风格和专业的多样性。",
	"As an artificer, you possess remarkable talents. You don't need the eldritch machines or vast resources that are traditionally involved in arcane industry, and can produce magical effects using just your personal tools. But what's the foundation of your magic? Are you building on the basic principles used by House Cannith or exploring less traditional paths of arcane science?": "作为一个工匠，你拥有非凡的才能。你不需要传统上涉及奥术工业的超自然机器或大量资源，只需使用你的个人工具就能产生神奇的效果。但你的魔法的基础是什么？你是建立在坎尼斯家族使用的基本原则之上，还是探索不那么传统的奥术科学之路？",
	"The {@table Artificer Techniques|ExploringEberron} table presents a few ideas. Use one of these or develop your own, considering how this affects your appearance and the way you cast your spells. Your unique style doesn't have to change any of the default rules associated with your magic. For example, you may say that you're working with principles of mundane science, but your spells will still be negated by {@spell counterspell}. Find creative ways to explain how your character's techniques interact with game rules. Perhaps some of your theories are completely false; while you believe that you're producing magical effects by talking to spirits or using Thelanian logic, it's possible you've stumbled on a different way to trigger traditional arcane reactions. If you want to explore mechanical advantages and limitations based on your unusual techniques, discuss it with your DM.": "{@table Artificer Techniques|ExploringEberron}表提出了一些想法。使用其中一个或开发你自己的，考虑这对你的外表和你施法的方式有什么影响。你的独特风格不必改变任何与你的魔法相关的默认规则。例如，你可以说你使用的是世俗科学的原理，但你的法术仍然会被（%1%）所否定。找到创造性的方法来解释你的角色的技术如何与游戏规则互动。也许你的一些理论是完全错误的；虽然你相信你是通过与神灵对话或使用Thelanian逻辑来产生魔法效果的，但你有可能偶然发现了一种不同的方法来触发传统的奥术反应。如果你想探索基于你的不寻常技术的机械优势和限制，请与你的管理员讨论。",
	"When you cast an artificer spell, you follow the same rules as other spellcasters—but what are you {@i doing} when you use your action to produce a magical effect? You aren't praying for divine intervention, invoking a supernatural patron, or producing a fireball with words and gestures. To cast spells, you must be holding a tool you're proficient with—why? Because you're using that tool and its associated skills to produce magical effects. If you're using alchemist's supplies to cast {@spell cure wounds}, you aren't just poking someone with a beaker; you're mixing a healing salve.": "当你施展工匠法术时，你遵循与其他施法者相同的规则--但当你用你的行动产生魔法效果时，你是什么（%0%）？你不是在祈祷神灵的干预，召唤超自然的守护者，或者用语言和手势产生一个火球。要施展法术，你必须拿着一个你精通的工具--为什么？因为你要使用那个工具及其相关技能来产生魔法效果。如果你使用炼金术士的用品来施展（%1%），你不仅仅是在用烧杯戳人；你是在混合治疗药水。",
	"Think about what your tools actually are. Artisan's tools are an abstract concept—10 pounds of assorted objects and supplies, not just a singular tool. You may have a satchel holding them or a bandolier of pouches. If you use {@item tinker's tools|PHB} to create an effect, what specific tools are you using, and how? Some of the most common tools of artifice are discussed below, but you can cast spells using any artisan's tool you're familiar with. You could even perform your alchemy using {@item brewer's supplies|PHB} or {@item cook's utensils|PHB}; why drink a potion when you could eat a magical pie?": "想一想你的工具究竟是什么。工匠的工具是一个抽象的概念--10磅重的各种物品和用品，而不只是一个单一的工具。你可能有一个装着它们的挎包或一个带状的小包。如果你使用（%0%）来创造一个效果，你使用什么具体的工具，以及如何使用？下面将讨论一些最常见的工匠工具，但你可以使用任何你熟悉的工匠工具来施法。你甚至可以用{@item brewer's supplies|PHB}或{@item cook's utensils|PHB}来执行你的炼金术；当你可以吃一个神奇的馅饼时，为什么要喝药水？",
	"The challenge of creating an alchemical potion is in suspending the mystical chemical reaction for later consumption. It's much easier to trigger an instant effect, and that's what you're doing when you cast your spells. Your {@spell fire bolt} could be a thrown flask, {@spell poison spray} is flinging foul substances. {@spell Cure wounds}, {@spell false life}, and {@spell water breathing} could be potions you mix and serve on the spot. {@spell Disguise self} or {@spell alter self} could be magical cosmetics.": "制造炼金术药水的挑战在于暂停神秘的化学反应，以便以后服用。触发即时效果要容易得多，而这正是你施法时要做的。你的{@spell fire bolt}可能是抛出的酒壶，{@spell poison spray}是抛出的污秽物质。{@spell Cure wounds}、{@spell false life}和{@spell water breathing}可能是你当场混合并提供的药水。{@spell Disguise self}或{@spell alter self}可能是神奇的化妆品。",
	"Sigilry channels arcane power through symbols and sound, using special inks and techniques. As with alchemy, it's much easier to produce an instant effect than to suspend and sustain it as a scroll. When you cast {@spell fire bolt}, perhaps you use your quill to trace the name of fire in the air before you; or you might have the sigil written down and you just read it to produce the effect. Whether you draw sigils onto things or craft simple scrolls and read them, your pen is mightier than most swords.": "Sigilry通过符号和声音引导奥术力量，使用特殊的墨水和技术。就像炼金术一样，产生一个即时效果要比把它作为一个卷轴来悬挂和维持要容易得多。当你施展（%0%）时，也许你用你的羽毛笔在你面前的空气中描画出火的名字；或者你可能已经写下了符号，你只要读出它就能产生效果。无论你是在东西上画符咒，还是制作简单的卷轴并阅读它们，你的笔都比大多数剑更有力量。",
	"This is a twist on the sigilist, and you could use your tools in the same way, drawing arcane glyphs. Or, more exotically, you could specialize in calculating ley lines and the relationships between the planes. The world is filled with micro-manifest zones waiting to be triggered; you're using your tools to calculate the proper alignments to channel the planar energies you need.": "这是对符咒师的一种转折，你可以用同样的方式使用你的工具，画出神秘的字形。或者，更奇特的是，你可以专门计算雷线和各平面之间的关系。这个世界充满了等待触发的微观显现区；你用你的工具来计算适当的排列以引导你需要的平面能量。",
	"If you want to be fanciful about it, you could paint what you need into reality. When you cure wounds, you're literally painting over the injury; when you cast {@spell fire bolt}, you paint the flame in the air and it flies toward your opponent. This is a variation of sigilry, but the same underlying principles apply. You might even create scrolls that are images rather than words.": "如果你想胡思乱想，你可以把你需要的东西画成现实。当你治疗伤口时，你实际上是在伤处涂抹；当你施放（%0%）时，你在空中涂抹火焰，它飞向你的对手。这是圣痕术的一种变体，但同样的基本原则也适用。你甚至可以创建图像而非文字的卷轴。",
	"Artificers are proficient with both thieves' tools and tinker's tools, and you use them in similar ways. Thieves' tools include picks and other fine manipulators. You don't cast a {@spell fire bolt} by pointing a lockpick at someone; but you could use it to clear a problematic valve on a dragon-pistol you made with tinker's tools.": "工匠精通盗贼的工具和工匠的工具，你们使用它们的方式也类似。盗贼的工具包括镐和其他精细的操纵器。你不能用锁匙指着别人来施放（%0%）；但你可以用它来清除你用工匠工具制造的龙枪上有问题的阀门。",
	"You can justify all manner of odd gadgets with tinker's tools, putting together a prototype that becomes part of your toolkit. A dragon-shaped sidearm could produce {@spell fire bolt} or a modified gauntlet could deliver {@spell shocking grasp}. These unstable prototypes can't be used by anyone else, needing constant tinkering to keep them working. So you always carry your tools, and to cast a spell, a \"tool\" must be in hand—but it can be a dragon-gun, as opposed to pliers. You might cast {@spell cure wounds} using a tiny metal spider you've tinkered; while it looks like a mundane clockwork construct, magic lets it move and think. Mundane engineering is part of a tinker's creations, but magic makes them work.": "你可以用工匠的工具来证明各种古怪的小玩意，把一个原型放在一起，成为你工具包的一部分。一个龙形挎包可以产生（%0%），或者一个改良的铠甲可以提供（%1%）。这些不稳定的原型不能被其他人使用，需要不断修补以保持它们的工作。所以你总是带着你的工具，为了施法，必须有一个 \"工具 \"在手--但它可以是一把龙枪，而不是钳子。你可能会用你修补过的一只小金属蜘蛛来施展（2%）；虽然它看起来像一个世俗的发条结构，但魔法让它移动和思考。世俗的工程是工匠创作的一部分，但魔法使它们发挥作用。",
	"Wands, staffs, and rods are some of the most basic forms of arcane focus. If you perform magic with woodcarver's tools, you aren't actually blasting someone with a saw. Instead, you are using experimental, exotic, or temporary wands or rods. As with tinker's tools, you have to have a tool in your hand and you have to possess woodcarver's tools to perform your magic, but the exact nature of which tool is in your hand is up to you. It could appear to be a traditional wand, or you could have come up with a new revolutionary form of wand, staff, or rod.": "魔杖、法杖和棒子是一些最基本的奥术专注形式。如果你用木匠的工具施展魔法，你并不是真的用锯子轰击别人。相反，你使用的是实验性的、异国的或临时的魔杖或魔棒。和工匠的工具一样，你手中必须有一个工具，你必须拥有木匠的工具才能施展你的魔法，但你手中的工具的确切性质由你决定。它可能看起来是一根传统的魔杖，也可能是你想出了一种新的革命性的魔杖、法杖或棍子的形式。",
	"As an artificer, you prepare spells during a long rest, but it's not like a wizard reading a book. It's about assembling the specialized supplies and tools you need for the things you want to do. A sigilist can't create a scroll with just any ink, but has entirely different inks based on the type of effects they're going to produce. Likewise, an alchemist prepares special reagents that combine to produce spell effects. If you use tinker's tools, you're creating and fine-tuning your gadgets. You can't create a dragon-pistol in six seconds; you prepare the pistol during your rest, and when you cast a spell, you're simply loading enchanted ammunition or triggering the arcane sigils you set in place.": "作为一个工匠，你在长时间的休息中准备法术，但这并不像巫师读一本书。它是关于为你想做的事情组装你所需要的专门用品和工具。一个符咒师不能用任何墨水来制作卷轴，而是根据他们要产生的效果类型，拥有完全不同的墨水。同样地，炼金术士准备特殊的试剂，结合起来产生法术效果。如果你使用工匠的工具，你就在创造和微调你的小玩意。你不可能在六秒钟内创造出一把龙枪；你在休息时准备好手枪，而当你施法时，你只是在装入附魔的弹药或触发你设置的奥术符号。",
	"This also explains the idea of spell slots. The reagents you've prepared are tricky to produce and don't last forever. You're preparing as much as you can, but once you go through all your mystic inks, you can't produce another scroll effect until you have a few hours to work on it. Effectively, your spells use temporary magic items that only you can use, created during a long rest.": "这也解释了法术槽的概念。你准备的试剂生产起来很棘手，而且不会永远存在。你尽可能多地准备，但一旦你用完了所有的神秘墨水，你就无法产生另一个卷轴效果，直到你有几个小时的时间来研究它。实际上，你的法术使用的是只有你才能使用的临时魔法物品，是在长时间休息时产生的。",
	"Meanwhile, infusions allow you to create longer-lasting tools that you can share with your companions. Artificers create magic items, but to maintain class balance, you can't flood the party with them; it's up to you what you do with this limited resource.": "同时，灌注允许你创造更持久的工具，并与你的同伴分享。工匠创造了魔法物品，但为了保持等级平衡，你不能让它们充斥整个队伍；如何利用这一有限的资源取决于你。",
	"Artillerists produce eldritch cannons and arcane firearms. Battle Smiths make steel defenders. Any artificer can craft a homunculus companion. But what are these? Are Artillerists wielding guns like those of our own world? Not necessarily.": "炮手生产长生火炮和奥术火器。战斗技师制造钢铁防御者。任何工匠都可以制作一个同体人伴侣。但这些是什么？炮手们挥舞的枪支和我们自己的世界一样吗？不一定。",
	"These items are \"arcane\" and \"eldritch.\" Much as the primary form of arcane artillery is the {@item siege staff|ExploringEberron}, the Artillerist uses woodcarver's tools, turning \"a rod, staff, or wand into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.\" So you're a specialized wandslinger with improved wands, staffs, and rods. You choose their appearance—a wand, a specialized hand crossbow, a flintlock pistol, a tiny metal dragon, or any aesthetic you like. \"Arcane firearm\" doesn't necessarily mean \"handgun.\"": "这些物品是 \"奥术的 \"和 \"长生的\"。就像奥术火炮的主要形式是{@item siege staff|ExploringEberron}一样，炮手使用木雕工具，将 \"棒子、法杖或魔杖变成奥术火器，成为你破坏性法术的管道。\" 所以你是一个专门的巫师，拥有改良的魔杖、法杖和棒子。你可以选择它们的外观--一根魔杖、一把专门的手弩、一把燧发枪、一条小金属龙，或者任何你喜欢的审美。\"奥术火器 \"并不一定意味着 \"手枪\"。",
	"While the name \"eldritch cannon\" sounds like a massive piece of artillery, an eldritch cannon is either small or tiny, possibly small enough to hold in your hand. What does it look like, and does it have legs? Is it an animated ballista? A small siege staff? A tiny brass dragon that breathes fire on your enemies?": "虽然 \"长生大炮 \"这个名字听起来像是一件巨大的火炮，但长生大炮要么很小，要么很小，可能小到可以拿在手里。它是什么样子的，它有腿吗？它是动画弹弓吗？一个小型攻城杖？一条对敌人喷火的小铜龙？",
	"The same principle applies to a homunculi's appearance. Consider your style and the tools that you use for your magic. Your homunculus servant can deliver your touch spells, but how? If you use painter's supplies to perform your magic, your homunculus could be a tiny humanoid paintbrush, a floating palette, or even a creature made out of living paint. An alchemist's homunculus could be a tiny cauldron or a little humanoid creature made from glass and beakers.": "同样的原则也适用于同体人的外观。考虑到你的风格和你用来施展魔法的工具。你的同体人仆人可以传递你的触摸法术，但如何传递？如果你使用画家的用品来施展你的魔法，你的同体人可以是一个小小的人形画笔，一个漂浮的调色板，甚至是一个由活的颜料制成的生物。炼金术士的同形体可以是一个小小的大锅，或者一个由玻璃和烧杯制成的小人形生物。",
	"Through all of these, the mechanics don't change. The shape of your arcane firearm makes no difference in combat rules; what it changes is the story that you're telling. What's interesting about your artificer? What does your homunculus say about you?": "通过所有这些，机制并没有改变。你的奥术火器的形状在战斗规则中没有区别；它所改变的是你所讲述的故事。你的工匠有什么有趣的地方？你的同体人对你有什么说法？",
	"You've developed your style and chosen your tools. But how and where did you develop your skills? Do you have a connection to an established order of artificers? Consider these ways your background could reflect your experience as an artificer.": "你已经形成了自己的风格，选择了自己的工具。但你是如何以及在哪里发展你的技能的？你是否与某个既定的工匠组织有联系？考虑一下你的背景可以反映你作为工匠的经验。",
	"You worked your way up in House Cannith or the Arcane Congress, studying at a trade school and working in an industrial forgehold. While you've abandoned the factory in favor of adventure, you still have strong ties in the Fabricator's Guild.": "你在坎尼斯家族或奥术大会中一路走来，在贸易学校学习，在工业锻造厂工作。虽然你已经放弃了工厂而选择了冒险，但你在制造者公会仍有很强的联系。",
	"You operated and maintained the engines of war. What nation did you serve? Are you proud of your service, or haunted by your deeds? Did you serve and retire with distinction—or are you a folk hero who deserted to help innocents?": "你们操作和维护战争的引擎。你为哪个国家服务？你是为你的服务感到骄傲，还是为你的事迹感到困扰？你是否服役并出色地退役，或者你是为帮助无辜者而开小差的民间英雄？",
	"You don't do well with authority. You may have started with Arcanix or the Twelve, but you were thrown out after challenging the system one too many times. You're brilliant—but determined to find your own path.": "你不善于与权威打交道。你可能已经开始在Arcanix或12人组织工作，但你在挑战系统太多次后被赶了出来。你很聪明，但决心要找到自己的道路。",
	"You've never studied arcane science, but you have an intuitive talent for artifice. Perhaps you grew up on battlefields, scavenging parts from warforged titans or shattered floating fortresses. Your work isn't pretty—and often seems like it {@i shouldn't} work—yet you can do things no magewright can match.": "你从未学习过神秘的科学，但你对制造有一种直觉上的天赋。也许你是在战场上长大的，从被战争锻造的泰坦巨人或破碎的浮动堡垒上搜刮零件。你的工作并不漂亮，而且经常看起来像（%0%）工作，但你能做到任何魔法师都无法比拟的事情。",
	"You provided arcane assistance to an organization operating out of the public eye. Did you serve with the Royal Eyes of Aundair or the King's Citadel of Breland, crafting common items for agents? Or was it a shadier operation like the Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan? Why did you shift to a life of adventure? What pieces of your old life could come back to haunt you?": "你为一个在公众视野之外运作的组织提供了奥术援助。你是否为昂代尔的皇家之眼或布雷兰德的国王城堡服务，为代理人制作普通物品？还是像博洛玛家族或塔卡南家族那样的阴暗行动？你为什么会转向冒险生活？你以前的生活中有哪些片段会回来纠缠你？",
	"If you're a guild artisan, what guild did you work with? When you buy a {@item wand of magic missiles} in Sharn, who made it?

	"Throughout the golden age of Galifar, the Arcane Congress delved into magical mysteries for the good of all. Today, it only serves the people of Aundair, yet remains the largest institute of both wizardry and artifice outside of House Cannith. The Arcane Congress was largely devoted to the war effort, but it has also continued to develop common magic items and other magical tools to improve the daily life of people in Aundair.": "在整个加利法尔的黄金时代，奥术大会为了所有人的利益而深入研究魔法的奥秘。今天，它只为昂代尔的人民服务，但仍然是坎尼斯家族之外最大的巫术和人工制品研究所。奥术大会主要致力于战争，但它也继续开发普通魔法物品和其他魔法工具，以改善昂代尔人的日常生活。",

	"House Cannith is the single largest source of artifice in the Five Nations, providing training through its trade schools and employing magewrights and artificers in its factories and forgeholds. The Fabricator's Guild creates both magical and mundane goods, while the loosely organized Tinker's Guild focuses on maintenance and repair. While Cannith has a broad range of expertise, Cannith West in Aundair excels at alchemy, Cannith South in Breland has the edge in general industry, and Cannith East specializes in artillery and dabbles in necromancy.": "坎尼斯家族是五国中最大的人工制品来源，通过其贸易学校提供培训，并在其工厂和锻造厂雇佣魔法师和工匠。制造者行会创造魔法和世俗的物品，而组织松散的修补者行会则专注于维护和修理。虽然坎尼斯拥有广泛的专业知识，但位于昂代尔的西坎尼斯擅长炼金术，位于布雷兰的南坎尼斯在一般工业方面具有优势，而东坎尼斯则专门从事火炮并涉足死灵法术。",

	"Every nation employed enhanced and arcane artillery in the war, along with battle magic. While most relied heavily on House Cannith, every nation has its own program researching military applications of magic, along with a corps of magewrights trained to operate artillery.

	"In a parallel to the cults of the Traveler, this secret order of magewrights and artificers believe they're directly inspired by the Sovereign Onatar. Members can be found scattered throughout the other organizations in this section. Onatar's Chosen believe that artifice should serve the greater good, and they seek to drive their organizations toward such positive purposes.": "与旅行者的邪教平行，这个由魔法师和工匠组成的秘密组织相信他们直接受到奥纳塔君主的启发。成员可以在本节的其他组织中找到。奥纳塔的神选者相信，工匠应该为更大的利益服务，他们试图推动他们的组织朝着这样的积极目的前进。",

	"These cults are a dark reflection of Onatar's Chosen. Followers of the Traveler are found in most organizations in this section, with a strong presence in House Cannith. Traveler cultists pursue innovation at all costs, creating weapons or tools that could shatter the existing balance of power or cause chaos in other ways. Some outsiders believe airships (which cause strife between Orien and Lyrandar) and warforged may been created by these cultists—and many blame the Traveler for the Mourning.": "这些邪教是奥纳塔的神选者的黑暗反映。旅行者的追随者在这部分的大多数组织中都能找到，在坎尼斯家族中的存在感很强。旅行者崇拜者不惜一切代价追求创新，创造出可以打破现有权力平衡的武器或工具，或以其他方式造成混乱。一些外人认为飞艇（导致奥瑞恩和利兰达之间的纷争）和战争锻造者可能是由这些邪教徒创造的--许多人将哀悼归咎于旅行者。",

	"Changelings are spread across Khorvaire and Sarlona. They can interbreed with many other humanoid species, and the offspring of such a union will either be changeling or the other species—there are no \"half-changelings.\" So just as you can be a Brelish elf with no ties to Aerenal, you can be a changeling with no connection to any changeling culture or community. There are changeling students in Arcanix and Morgrave, changeling agents in the King's Citadel and the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and any number of changelings devoted to the nations they call home. So you don't {@i need} deep cultural ties to play a changeling character, but if you want to explore a connection to your changeling roots, here are a few ideas.": "变种人分布在霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳。他们可以与许多其他类人物种杂交，这种结合的后代要么是变种人，要么是其他物种，没有 \"半变种人\"。因此，正如你可以成为一个与Aerenal没有关系的Brelish精灵，你也可以成为一个与任何changeling文化或社区没有关系的changeling。在阿卡尼克斯和莫格雷夫有变种人学生，在国王城堡和阿恩代尔的皇家之眼有变种人特工，还有任何数量的变种人致力于他们称之为家园的国家。所以你不{@i need}有很深的文化联系来扮演一个变种人角色，但如果你想探索与你的变种人根的联系，这里有几个想法。",
	"Nomadic changelings are often referred to as \"travelers,\" a name referencing both to their wandering lifestyle as well as the Traveler of the Dark Six—who, legend holds, gave them the ability to change their form, and whose chaotic nature is echoed in the lives of many travelers today.": "游牧的变身者通常被称为 \"旅行者\"，这个名字既指他们的流浪生活方式，也指黑暗六人组的旅行者--传说是他给了他们改变形态的能力，而他的混乱本质在今天许多旅行者的生活中得到了回应。",
	"The oldest traveler tradition is that of the Children of Jes. Inspired by the Traveler, the Children follow migratory patterns that slowly evolve, keeping them from becoming too predictable to outsiders. Many travel in small groups—a troupe of entertainers, a merchant convoy, a stagecoach of exotic travelers. Others prefer to travel alone. Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.": "最古老的旅行者传统是杰斯之子的传统。受旅行者的启发，孩子们遵循缓慢发展的迁徙模式，使他们不至于对外人来说变得太容易预测。许多人以小团体的形式旅行--艺人的剧团、商人的车队、异国旅行者的马车。其他人则喜欢独自旅行。无论怎样，他们相信变化的重要性，在他们的流浪过程中扮演着许多角色。工匠、吟游诗人、信使和牧师是常见的角色，而变种人很可能在他们的行业中相当有天赋。旅行者牧师可以在早上向主人布道，在晚上带领火焰之歌。由于隐藏了他们真正的变种人本性，孩子们通常对他们周围的人来说是看不见的；他们使用一种秘密的纹身和伤疤语言来识别彼此，同时还有一套共同的角色。",
	"Few people in the Five Nations understand the culture and values held by changeling travelers. Some are unnerved by the concept of a hidden culture, that a stranger might not be the human or hobgoblin they appear to be. Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to \"obtain\" another's possessions as long as they're replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler's blessing is their license to prey on the \"single-skins\"—a term for races lacking the changeling gift for shapeshifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people—whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid—though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shapeshifting abilities and nomadic preferences.": "五国中很少有人理解变种人的文化和价值观。有些人对隐秘文化的概念感到不安，认为陌生人可能不是他们表面上的人类或妖精。其他人则认为，由于变种人拥有随意改变面孔的不可思议的能力，他们会利用这种能力达到邪恶的目的，在继续前进之前欺骗诚实的人。变形人的传统早于加利法尔和它的法律，事实上，有些人认为 \"获得 \"他人的财产是公平的，只要用同等价值的礼物来代替。一些旅行者声称，旅行者的祝福是他们掠夺 \"单皮 \"的许可--这是一个对缺乏变身天赋的种族的称呼。然而，旅行者并不比任何其他人更天生不诚实--无论是龙纹继承人还是守门人德鲁伊--尽管那些尊重当地习俗的人仍然会因为他们的变身能力和游牧偏好而受到很多怀疑。",
	"As a player character, the changeling traveler background presented in chapter 6 can allow you to be part of a secretive network of changelings spread across the nation. As a DM, you could present the Children as a stereotypical source of thieves and charlatans. But they could be more enigmatic—an unexpected ally that can appear almost anywhere.": "作为一个玩家角色，第6章中介绍的变种人旅行者背景可以让你成为遍布全国的变种人秘密网络的一部分。作为管理人，你可以将变异人呈现为盗贼和骗子的典型来源。但他们也可以更加神秘--一个几乎可以出现在任何地方的意外盟友。",
	"Under the rule of Galifar, many changelings chose to emerge from the shadows and live in the open, and today they can be found in most major cities of the Five Nations. Changelings in stable communities—such as Dragoneyes in Sharn or the Blackleaf district of Wroat—rarely hide their true nature. This allows them to sell their services openly and to pursue careers that make use of their unique talents, as explored in the \"Changeling Careers\" sidebar. However, many still make use of shared personas, and outsiders can be confused by the changelings' fluid relationship with identity. Settled changelings don't face the same level of prejudice as travelers, but there are still many single-skins who believe no changeling can be trusted.": "在加利法尔的统治下，许多变种人选择从阴影中走出来，生活在公开场合，如今他们可以在五国的大多数主要城市找到。稳定社区中的变种人--如沙恩的龙眼（Dragoneyes）或沃洛特的黑叶区--很少隐藏他们的真实本性。这使他们能够公开出售自己的服务，并从事能够利用其独特才能的职业，正如 \"变种人职业 \"侧栏中所探讨的那样。然而，许多人仍在使用共同的角色，外人可能会被变种人与身份的流动关系所迷惑。定居的变种人不会像旅行者那样面临同样程度的偏见，但仍有许多单皮人认为没有变种人可以信任。",
	"In addition to changeling neighborhoods in the cities of the Five Nations, there are two unique changeling cultures. The Gray Tide principality of the Lhazaar Principalities is a nation of changelings with a strong mercantile tradition; some say that the Gray Tide engages in a great deal of piracy, using their shapeshifting gifts to shift the blame to other princes. In Droaam, changelings are said to have a stronghold in the city of Lost. However, no outsider knows the location of Lost, and it's said that the city itself is alive, and can freely move and change its shape. Regardless, the changelings of Lost have been strong allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell, and changelings can be found serving Daask.": "除了五国城市中的变种人社区外，还有两种独特的变种人文化。拉扎尔公国的灰潮公国是一个拥有强大商业传统的变种人国家；有人说灰潮公国从事大量的海盗活动，利用他们的变身天赋将责任推给其他公国。在德罗阿姆，据说变革者在迷失之城有一个据点。然而，没有外人知道失落城的位置，据说这座城市本身是有生命的，可以自由移动和改变形状。不管怎么说，迷失之城的变化者一直是索拉-凯尔之女的强大盟友，而且可以发现变化者为达斯克服务。",
	"As a player character, a stable background gives you a place to call home and allows you to be open about your true nature. As a DM, a changeling community can be an interesting backdrop for an adventure or an easy place to find changeling services.": "作为一个玩家角色，一个稳定的背景给了你一个可以称之为家的地方，让你可以公开你的真实本性。作为DM，一个变种人社区可以成为一个有趣的冒险背景，或者一个容易找到变种人服务的地方。",
	"People often think of the shapeshifting talents of the changeling as a tool for deception. But in places where changelings live openly, including Droaam and the major cities of the Five Nations, there are many practical uses for shapeshifting. Changelings have long dominated the industry of paid companionship, using their talents to fulfill fantasies. While this can be sexual, there are many other changeling companions who specialize in giving a client the opportunity to have a meal or conversation with a distant loved one, or to practice a difficult conversation with a changeling stand-in. Many artists use changelings as versatile models. Changelings can also often be found as beauticians; in addition to possessing a deep understanding of the shifting nature of appearance, a changeling can use their own form as a palette on which to perfect the look a client is aiming for.": "人们通常认为变种人的变身才能是一种欺骗的工具。但在变种人公开生活的地方，包括德拉姆和五国的主要城市，变身有许多实际用途。长期以来，变种人一直主导着有偿陪伴的行业，利用他们的才能来满足人们的幻想。虽然这可以是性方面的，但也有许多其他的变身人伴侣，他们专门给客户提供与远方亲人吃饭或谈话的机会，或与变身人的替身练习困难的谈话。许多艺术家使用变身人作为多功能的模特。变种人也经常被发现是美容师；除了对外观的变化性质有深刻的理解外，变种人还可以用自己的外形作为调色板，在上面完善客户所要的外观。",
	"Impersonation is also a viable career. Do you need to be in two places at once? Do you want a local celebrity to appear at your child's birthday party? Hire a changeling impersonator. The Defender's Guild of House Deneith has recently begun training and licensing elite changeling bodyguards, capable of serving as body doubles or posing as harmless bystanders until needed.": "冒充也是一个可行的职业。你需要同时出现在两个地方吗？你想让当地名人出现在你孩子的生日聚会上吗？雇佣一个变种人的模仿者吧。迪尼斯家族的卫士公会最近开始培训和许可精英变种人保镖，他们能够充当替身，或者在需要时冒充无害的旁观者。",
	"Many changelings pursue a career in entertainment. After all, a changeling with the proper {@item shiftweave|ERLW} outfit can play five roles! However, House Thuranni and House Phiarlan have been accused of denying opportunities to changelings. In licensed Phiarlan companies, changelings are typically relegated to serving as understudies and stunt doubles for dragonmarked superstars.": "许多变种人追求娱乐事业。毕竟，一个拥有适当（%0%）装备的变种人可以扮演五个角色！但是，瑟兰尼家族和菲亚兰家族被指责为剥夺了变种人的机会。然而，瑟兰尼家族和菲亚尔兰家族一直被指责为拒绝给变种人提供机会。在获得许可的Phiarlan公司中，变种人通常被降级为龙纹超级明星的替身和特技替身。",
	"While changelings are well represented in the major cities, there are many villages and towns where they're treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a passer, you've crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You may live your entire life as a human warrior or an elf priest, engaging your shapeshifting abilities only as a last resort.": "虽然变种人在主要城市有很好的代表性，但在许多村庄和城镇，他们受到恐惧和怀疑的对待。你可能出生在这样一个社区，甚至可能从未认识过其他的变种人。作为一个通行者，你已经精心设计了一个单一的身份，你认为这是你的真实面目。你可能一生都在以人类战士或精灵牧师的身份生活，只有在不得已的情况下才使用你的变身能力。",
	"If you grew up as a passer, how do you live today? Do you want to learn more about other changeling cultures, or do you deny any connection to other changelings? Do you acknowledge your changeling nature, or do you consider your passer identity to be your true self?

	"Passer can be an interesting choice for an urchin, outlander, or a changeling who's lived through oppression and is only now coming to understand their true nature.

	"Changelings are as diverse as any other species, presenting many other cultures and paths you could explore. {@i Reality seekers} are settled changelings who prefer their natural form and avoid deception, instead searching for the ultimate truth. {@i Becomers} actively seek to live many lives in order to more fully understand the experiences of others. The Cabinet of Faces is a secret society devoted to the Traveler, and its members actively seek to challenge traditions and cause chaos. Do you have ties to any of these movements?": "变种人和其他物种一样多样化，呈现出许多其他文化和路径，你可以探索。{@i Reality seekers}是定居的变化者，他们喜欢他们的自然形态，避免欺骗，而是寻找最终的真相。{@i Becomers}积极寻求过多种生活，以便更充分地了解他人的经历。面孔内阁是一个致力于旅行者的秘密社团，其成员积极寻求挑战传统并造成混乱。你与这些运动中的任何一个有关系吗？",
	"For a changeling, an identity is like a set of clothes. Within a changeling community, a persona may serve the same role a badge of office or uniform would for a human. The local priest is Father Hes. The sheriff is Big Dol. The healer is Lela. Whoever takes on the job assumes that persona. There may be three different priests, but whoever is currently on duty assumes the identity of Hes. In part, this is visual, but it's also about adopting a personality—not just looking like Father Hes, but {@i becoming} Father Hes, giving the people a sense of continuity.": "对于一个变种人来说，身份就像一套衣服。在一个变种人社区里，一个角色的作用可能与人类的办公徽章或制服的作用相同。当地的牧师是Hes神父。警长是大多尔。治疗师是Lela。不管是谁担任这个工作，都要扮演这个角色。可能有三个不同的牧师，但目前正在值班的人都是Hes的身份。在某种程度上，这是视觉上的，但它也是关于采用一种个性--不仅仅是看起来像赫斯神父，而是（%0%）赫斯神父，给人们一种连续性的感觉。",
	"This is especially important for the traveling clans. Travelers use well-established personas as anchors in potentially hostile communities. A trusted merchant, a beloved storyteller, or a reliable mercenary—any traveler can use one of these established personas to ensure a warm welcome. Of course, when using an established persona, it's up to you to preserve its reputation. If you're exposed as a changeling or if you ruin the reputation of the persona, you're destroying a valuable tool.": "这对旅行者的家族来说尤其重要。旅行者在潜在的敌对社区中使用成熟的角色作为锚。一个值得信赖的商人，一个受人喜爱的说书人，或者一个可靠的雇佣兵--任何旅行者都可以使用这些既定的角色之一来确保受到热烈欢迎。当然，当你使用一个既定的角色时，你应该保护它的声誉。如果你被暴露为变种人，或者你破坏了这个角色的声誉，你就会毁掉一个有价值的工具。",
	"Many changelings develop their own unique personas. If you're a fighter with proficiency in the violin, you might use a grim half-orc form in combat and an elegant elf when you play the violin. You're not required to use a persona—the violinist could fight in their elf form—but the persona can serve as a way to focus on that particular skill. The {@feat Focused Personas|ExploringEberron} feat in chapter 6 provides a concrete reflection of this.": "许多变身者发展出他们自己独特的角色。如果你是一个精通小提琴的战士，你可能在战斗中使用狰狞的半兽人形态，而在拉小提琴时使用优雅的精灵形态。你不需要使用角色--小提琴手可以用他们的精灵形态战斗--但是角色可以作为专注于该特定技能的一种方式。第6章中的{@feat Focused Personas|ExploringEberron}壮举就具体反映了这一点。",
	"You could create a character of any class and background who just happens to be a changeling—or you can create a character whose concept is integrally tied to your identity as a changeling. Chapter 6 presents a changeling traveler background, three racial feats, and a Living Weapon monk subclass that blends shapechanging with martial discipline. However, you can have an equally interesting story with a character of any background or class, instead adjusting the \"fluff\"—the cosmetic details or backstory of a class—to fit an idea.

As an Aereni elf, you aren't expected to {@i improve} your society; your task is to prove yourself worthy of it and to earn your afterlife.": "作为Aereni的一员，你走的路与Khorvaire的人不同。你出生在一个由古老而强大的神灵守护和引导的领域。你从那些几千年前就已经死去的老师那里学到了教训，你知道即使是摆在你面前的几个世纪的生活也只是你灵魂旅程的开始。你们的人民拥有昂代尔无法掌握的奥秘知识；不死阁的祭司们拥有只有火焰守护者才能比拟的力量。你们来自一个充满奇迹的国度，一个由神圣力量引导的领域。简而言之，你们的人民已经达到了完美的境界。作为一个Aereni精灵，你并不被期望{@i improve}你的社会；你的任务是证明自己配得上它，并赢得你的来世。",
	"Aereni elves have a reputation for being arrogant and condescending. Why wouldn't you be? Humans are like children to you, with their short lives and desperation to do things quickly regardless of the quality of their efforts. Even the elves that settled in Khorvaire have abandoned the traditions of their ancestors and their blessed homeland. It's easy to be smug... but who wants that character around? An Aereni elf doesn't have to be unpleasant. As one of the Aereni, you are a traveler from a mysterious and magical kingdom. You possess ancient wisdom and a tie to divine spirits. Beyond that, the Undying Court is one of the few forces in the world that has a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy. Have you come to Khorvaire as an emissary of the Undying Court, whether as a diplomat or an agent of prophecy? Are you working on behalf of a noble family, pursuing mercantile interests, or seeking an artifact stolen from your people long ago? Are you an anthropologist fascinated by the behavior of humanity? Are you a paladin in the service of the Deathguard, charged to exterminate undead wherever they can be found? Or are you an exile, driven from your homeland and forced to live among the barbarians?": "Aereni精灵以傲慢和居高临下而闻名。你为什么不呢？人类对你来说就像孩子，他们生命短暂，不顾一切地快速做事，不顾他们的努力质量。即使是定居在霍尔韦尔的精灵，也放弃了他们祖先的传统和他们受祝福的故乡。自鸣得意很容易......但谁想让这种性格在身边呢？一个Aereni精灵不一定是不讨人喜欢的。作为艾瑞尼人的一员，你是一个来自神秘而神奇的王国的旅行者。你拥有古老的智慧和与神灵的联系。除此之外，不死阁是世界上为数不多的能瞥见德拉贡预言的力量之一。你是作为不死阁的使者来到霍尔韦尔，无论是作为外交官还是预言的代理人？你是代表一个贵族家庭工作，追求商业利益，还是在寻找很久以前从你的人民那里偷走的文物？你是一个对人类行为着迷的人类学家吗？你是一名为死亡守卫服务的圣骑士，负责在任何地方消灭亡灵？或者你是一个流亡者，被赶出你的家园，被迫生活在野蛮人中间？",
	"Whether you play an Aereni character or encounter them as NPCs, this section provides insight into the land of the elves. In addition, chapter 6 presents a feat and subrace for Aereni elves.": "无论你是扮演Aereni角色还是作为NPC遇到他们，本节都提供了对精灵土地的深入了解。此外，第6章介绍了Aereni精灵的特技和亚种族。",
	"Aerenal is an isolated nation with little interest in the outside world. They have little fear of conquest; the divine power of the Undying Court has repelled assaults by legions of dragons. But the power of the Undying Court doesn't extend beyond Aerenal, and the elves have chosen to remain in their haven rather than to expand across the world. From this island sanctuary, they have seen the Empire of Dhakaan rise and fall, and they expect to be around long after the Five Nations have fallen to dust. Here are a few more important things to know about Aerenal.": "Aerenal是一个与世隔绝的国家，对外部世界没有什么兴趣。他们几乎不惧怕征服；不死阁的神圣力量已经击退了龙族军团的进攻。但是，不死阁的力量并没有延伸到艾瑞纳之外，精灵们选择留在他们的避难所，而不是向全世界扩张。从这个岛屿上的避难所，他们见证了达卡安帝国的兴衰，他们期望在五国沦为尘埃之后还能长期存在。以下是关于Aerenal的一些更重要的事情。",
	"Aerenal is ruled by the living. The Sibling Kings lead the nation from Shae Cairdal, and the high priests and lords of the lines are mortal elves. But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to {@i spirit idols}, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These sprits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.": "Aerenal是由活人统治的。兄弟姐妹国王从沙伊-凯尔达尔领导这个国家，大祭司和各系领主是凡人精灵。但死者引导并保护着生者。当杰出的精灵死亡时，他们会被保存到死后。大多数人被绑在{@i spirit idols}，保存灵魂的雕像上，并防止其在Dolurrh解体。但也有一些人被养成了无死之身，类似于木乃伊的亡灵，但由正能量维持。没有死亡的士兵守卫着地下墓穴和神庙，没有死亡的圣人和顾问与他们的后代分享他们的知识和智慧。随着时间的推移，没有死亡的人可以上升到一个更伟大的境界，成为几乎不需要身体的纯粹精神的生命。这些被称为 \"升天议员 \"的精灵居住在伟大的城市Shae Mordai，当他们的精神在一个神秘的格式中结合在一起时，他们就会拥有神圣的力量。",
	"Many outsiders assume that the ascendant councilors are the Undying Court, and it's true they are the source of its power. But the Undying Court refers to {@i all} the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the {@i spirit idols}. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor—this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years—but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.": "许多外人认为，长老会成员就是不死阁，他们确实是不死阁的权力来源。但不死阁指的是（%0%）岛上的不死守护者，从士兵到（%1%）。你可能不会期望成为一个长老级的理事--这是一个通常需要数千年的进化过程--但你可以渴望在死后加入不死阁。",
	"As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones—such as the one in Shae Mordai—but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn't rely on faith; there's no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people—from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive.": "作为一个艾瑞尼人，你对自己对不死之庭的责任有着敏锐的认识。不死之身是靠正能量维持的；这可以从伊里安的显化区--比如Shae Mordai的显化区--汲取，但也可以通过爱和奉献产生。与Eberron的许多宗教不同，不死之庭并不依赖信仰；不存在不死之庭是否存在的问题。但它确实依赖于奉献。你的祈祷和你的信仰是你为法庭为你和你的人民所做的一切提供的交换条件--从保护你的土地不受入侵、瘟疫和自然灾害的影响，到指导你的领导人和训练你的年轻人。你们的祖先保护你们，但他们也需要你们的奉献来生存。",
	"The deathless state isn't the only way to experience eternity. Most honored dead of Aerenal are preserved in spirit idols that preserve the soul from the dissolution of Dolurrh. This stone bust of a dead elf holds relics of their corpse (bone shards, a lock of hair) embedded within it. While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance—a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A {@i spirit idol} can be awakened with the {@spell speak with dead} spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.": "无死亡状态并不是体验永恒的唯一途径。艾瑞纳的大多数尊贵的死者都被保存在精神偶像中，使灵魂免受多鲁尔的溶解。这个死去的精灵的半身石像内嵌有他们尸体的遗物（骨头碎片、一绺头发）。在休眠状态下，神像内的灵魂不知道外界或时间的流逝，存在于一种持续的恍惚中--一种由记忆和个人经历建立的梦境般的存在。一个{@i spirit idol}的神像可以通过{@spell speak with dead}的咒语被唤醒，尽管有些神像会无限期地保持意识，并且可以被发现担任导师、教务长和法官。",
	"Not all Aereni want to become deathless—many consider the {@i spirit idol} the superior state. The deathless are sworn to protect and serve the living, and must deal with the ongoing inconvenience of physical existence; within a {@i spirit idol}, an elf can experience eternal peace in a dream of their own making. For many Aereni, their greatest goal in life is to gather the memories and ideas that will be their companions in their eternal trance after death.": "并非所有艾瑞尼人都想成为无死之人--许多人认为{@i spirit idol}的状态更优越。没有死亡的人发誓要保护和服务于活着的人，并且必须处理身体存在的持续不便；在{@i spirit idol}的范围内，精灵可以在他们自己制造的梦境中体验永恒的和平。对许多Aereni来说，他们一生中最大的目标是收集记忆和想法，这些记忆和想法将成为他们死后永恒的恍惚中的伙伴。",
	"While there are more {@i spirit idols} than there are deathless, not all dead are preserved this way. {@i Spirit idols} are reserved for those who have proven worthy of eternal existence. The common dead are embalmed after death and interred in the vast catacombs below the land, along with a record of their life. Only those who have committed truly heinous crimes—such as grave robbers—are denied memory; such criminals are burned after death, their ashes scattered in the oceans, with no records kept of their lives.": "虽然{@i spirit idols}比没有死亡的人多，但并不是所有的死者都是这样被保存的。{@i Spirit idols}是留给那些已经证明值得永恒存在的人。普通死者死后被防腐处理，连同他们的生活记录一起被埋在土地下面的巨大地下墓穴中。只有那些犯下真正令人发指的罪行的人--如盗墓者--才会被剥夺记忆；这样的罪犯在死后被烧死，他们的骨灰散落在海洋中，没有关于他们生活的记录。",
	"Both arcane and divine magic are woven into Aereni civilization more deeply than in the Five Nations. Every citizen of Aerenal knows at least one useful cantrip; the skills of a master magewright in Khorvaire would be considered a mere apprentice's training in Aerenal. Here, spell effects of up to 5th level can be found woven into the fabric of everyday life. {@spell teleportation circle||Teleportation circles} link Aerenal's great cities, and {@i {@spell sending} stations} allow instant communication across any distance. Buildings are raised using the principles of {@spell stone shape}. Diviners communicate with other planes, and healers can break curses and reverse petrification. Spell effects of up to 7th level can be encountered in the hands of master wizards and high priests, and Aereni artificers can craft very rare magic items. As you explore Khorvaire and the lands beyond, bear in mind that in your Aereni eyes, it's little more than a primitive backwater.": "与五国相比，奥术和神术在Aereni文明中的交织程度更深。每个艾瑞纳的公民都至少知道一种有用的咒语；在霍尔韦尔，魔法大师的技能在艾瑞纳仅仅被认为是学徒的训练。在这里，5级以下的法术效果可以在日常生活的结构中找到交织。{@spell teleportation circle||Teleportation circles}连接着Aerenal的大城市，{@i {@spell sending}站}可以跨越任何距离进行即时通信。建筑物是利用（%2%）的原理升起的。占卜者可以与其他位面沟通，治疗者可以打破诅咒并扭转石化现象。大师级的巫师和大祭司手中可以遇到高达7级的法术效果，Aereni工匠可以制作非常罕见的魔法物品。当你探索霍尔韦尔和其他土地时，请记住，在你的Aereni眼中，它只不过是一个原始的落后地区。",
	"At a glance, the people of Aerenal are simply better at everything than their counterparts in Khorvaire, due to their exceptional work ethic and long lifespan. An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren't trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan's goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters—and in Aerenal, they're still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it's a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You've never been encouraged to innovate; you've been taught that {@i the old ways are the best ways}. Do you agree with this?": "一眼望去，艾瑞纳人在任何方面都比霍尔韦尔的同行要强，这是因为他们有特殊的职业道德和长寿命。一个Aereni工匠可以用多个人类的寿命来完善他们的工艺。即使是在恍惚的时候，一个精灵也可能在思考他们的工作。然而，在工业和创新方面，Aerenal落后于Khorvaire。艾瑞尼人并不试图找到更好的方法来做事情；精灵工匠的目标是与过去的大师的技能相匹配，而不是找到新的技术。挑战过去是对那些古老大师的侮辱--在Aerenal，他们仍然存在，仍然在传授他们的技术。一个Aereni工匠可以制造出非常罕见的魔法物品，这是Cannith锻造厂无法比拟的，但这是一件需要多年才能完成的手工艺术品，而Cannith锻造厂正在生产大量的普通和不普通的物品，并不断寻找创新的方法。今天的五国可能无法与Aerenal相提并论，但在过去的一千年中，五国已经发生了巨大的变化，而Aerenal却停滞不前。你从来没有被鼓励去创新，你一直被教导说（%0%）。你同意这一点吗？",
	"Aerenal is effectively a collection of city-states, united in devotion to the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court. Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, \"the line of Mendyrian\" refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname—such as Belaereth Mendyrian—is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it's not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings—the rulers of the united kingdom—are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren't blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.": "Aerenal实际上是一个城邦的集合体，在对兄弟姐妹国王和不朽的法庭的奉献中团结起来。这个国家的每个地区（除了泰尔纳达尔的北部领土）都由一个贵族家族管理。艾伦纳尔的原始定居者来自不同的文化和环境，各系代表了这一点；虽然所有的人都被艾伦纳尔的共同习俗所团结，但每个系都有自己独特的时尚和传统。一个家族是一个古老家族的联盟，由一个带有该家族名称的贵族家族管理。因此，\"门迪里安家族 \"指的是多个家族，但使用该姓氏的人--如贝拉里思-门迪里安--是贵族家族的成员。贵族血统代表了该地区的精英；它不是一个世袭家族，而是一个任人唯贤的组织，其成员从该地区的人民中选出。同样，兄弟姐妹国王--联合王国的统治者--也是同一家族的成员，象征性地是兄弟姐妹，但他们不是血亲。因此，在生活中，精灵们渴望被任命为他们的贵族系列；在死亡时，他们希望被提升到不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating an Aereni elf, work with your DM to develop details about your family and the line you owe allegiance to. Since each line is an alliance of multiple families, there's room for you to add your own details even within an existing line.

	"The line of Jhaelian governs the region around Taer Kalindal. Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the Undying Court and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many monks, clerics, and paladins, as well as many members of the Deathguard—the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down Mabaran undead. Members of this line have a tradition of using cosmetic transmutation to adopt a desiccated appearance—not unlike that of the deathless themselves—though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.": "Jhaelian家族管辖着Taer Kalindal周围的地区。Jhaelian有强大的精神传统；它的成员深深地致力于不朽的法庭和对神圣奥秘的沉思。这个系列产生了许多僧侣、牧师和圣骑士，以及许多死亡守卫的成员--致力于猎杀马巴兰亡灵的Aereni机构。这个系列的成员有一个传统，就是使用化妆术来采用干燥的外观--与无死亡者本身的外观并不一样--尽管其他Jhaelian Aereni喜欢戴面具。",
	"Governors of the region surrounding Pylas Talaear, the line of Melideth produces the finest sailors of Aerenal and maintains the Aereni navy.

	"The line of Mendyrian governs the region around Shae Cairdal, and for most of Aerenal's history they have also been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings. The Mendyrian Aereni are devoted to arcane lore, and many of the most gifted wizards and artificers are Mendyrian. The Mendyrian Aereni take particular pride in their appearance, favoring ornate patterns and decoration in clothing, elaborate hairstyles, and masks of metal or leather.": "门迪里安一系统治着沙伊-凯尔达尔周围的地区，在艾瑞纳的大部分历史中，他们也是兄弟姐妹国王的来源和所在地。门迪里安-艾瑞尼人专注于神秘的传说，许多最有天赋的巫师和工匠都是门迪里安人。门迪雅人对自己的外表感到特别自豪，他们喜欢华丽的图案和装饰的衣服，精致的发型，以及金属或皮革的面具。",
	"Centered around Pylas Zirinth, the line of Tolaen drives Aerenal's lumber industry, both harvesting wood for trade and producing the finest architects and wood-masons on the island. While they are devoted to the Undying Court, the Tolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts than in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen also produce many of Aerenal's soldiers and usually have good relations with the Tairnadal. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple, functional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are usually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen soldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.": "以Pylas Zirinth为中心，Tolaen家族推动了Aerenal的木材工业，既为贸易收获木材，又培养了岛上最好的建筑师和木匠。虽然他们致力于不朽之庭，但托拉恩-艾瑞尼更多的是致力于完善物理工艺，而不是沉思形而上的奥秘。托拉恩也生产许多艾瑞纳的士兵，并且通常与泰尔纳达尔的关系良好。托拉恩-艾瑞尼人喜欢简单、实用的衣服，没有什么装饰品。托拉恩的面具通常由木头制成，可能会有复杂的雕刻；托拉恩士兵经常戴着半面具，遮住他们的下脸。",
	"All but unknown in the Five Nations, the Valraea are a line of {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}. Their ancestors were magebred and charged to guard and govern the coastline of Aerenal. While rare, Valraea can be encountered in any of the port cities of Aerenal and are represented in the Undying Court. While Valraea characters use the sea elf subrace instead of the Aereni elf subrace presented in chapter 6, they are culturally Aereni and all the other material in this section applies to them. Valraea typically dress in leather and are comfortable with casual nudity; they fashion masks from shell and bone. More information about the Valraea Aereni can be found in chapter 4.": "瓦拉亚人在五国中几乎无人知晓，他们是{@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}的一族。他们的祖先是魔法师，负责保卫和管理Aerenal的海岸线。虽然很稀少，但在Aerenal的任何一个港口城市都可以遇到Valraea，并且在不朽的法庭中也有代表。虽然瓦拉亚人使用海精灵亚种，而不是第6章中介绍的艾瑞尼精灵亚种，但他们在文化上属于艾瑞尼人，本节中的所有其他材料都适用于他们。瓦拉亚人通常穿着皮衣，对随意的裸露感到舒服；他们用贝壳和骨头制作面具。更多关于瓦拉亚人的信息可以在第四章中找到。",

It may not be provable, but you believe it's a concrete environmental threat—have you noticed plants tend to die in places with lots of undead? As someone who's going to live a long time, your people take these things seriously. While you can put up with their presence if a situation absolutely requires it, you likely consider negative undead a serious threat.": "作为Aereni，你习惯于与死人一起生活，但那些没有死亡的人是用正能量维持的。与此相反，不死阁教导说，马巴兰亡灵--负能量的亡灵，从骷髅和僵尸到地衣和吸血鬼，都具有内在的破坏性。除了他们中的许多人为了生存而捕食活人之外，他们是马巴的通道，仅仅因为存在而耗尽了世界的环境生命。这可能无法证明，但你相信这是一个具体的环境威胁--你是否注意到在有大量亡灵的地方，植物往往会死亡？作为一个要活很久的人，你的人对这些事情很重视。虽然如果情况绝对需要，你可以忍受他们的存在，但你很可能认为负面的亡灵是一个严重的威胁。",
	"As an Aereni elf in Khorvaire, you're far from home. Are you an exile, an emissary, or a simple tourist? Here are some ways your background might affect your character's new life.": "作为霍尔韦尔的艾瑞尼精灵，你离家很远。你是一个流亡者，一个使者，还是一个普通的游客？这里有一些你的背景可能会影响你的角色的新生活的方式。",
	"As an acolyte, you're a recognized servant of the Undying Court. Temples of the Undying Court are rare in Khorvaire, but they can be found in major cities. Beyond this, you can request minor assistance from any Aereni; they won't place themselves in danger, but they'll show respect and support you.": "作为一名圣徒，你是不死阁公认的仆人。不死阁的寺庙在霍尔韦尔很少见，但在主要城市可以找到。除此之外，你可以向任何艾瑞尼人请求小的援助；他们不会将自己置于危险之中，但他们会对你表示尊重和支持。",
	"Crime is rare in Aerenal, but these backgrounds can reflect a connection to criminal organizations in Khorvaire. This could be something your family developed for business. It could be tied to your personal history, especially if you're an exile from Aerenal. Or you could be an agent of the Cairdal Blades—one of their spies—in which case you might be using criminal connections as a source of information.": "在阿伦纳尔，犯罪是罕见的，但这些背景可以反映出与霍尔韦尔的犯罪组织有联系。这可能是你的家族为了生意而发展的。它可能与你的个人历史有关，特别是如果你是一个来自Aerenal的流亡者。或者你可能是凯尔达尔之刃的特工--他们的间谍--在这种情况下，你可能利用犯罪关系作为信息来源。",
	"As an entertainer, your Popular Demand feature could reflect your reputation in Aerenal, Khorvaire, or both. Are your performances tied to the traditions of your ancestors or are you creating something new? Are you willing to work with House Phiarlan or House Thuranni—who will want to license any popular act—or do you despise the dragonmarked for abandoning Aerenal, refusing to work with them?": "作为一个艺人，你的 \"流行需求 \"功能可以反映你在艾瑞纳、霍尔韦尔或两者的声誉。你的表演是与你的祖先的传统联系在一起，还是你在创造新的东西？你是否愿意与皮亚伦家族或瑟兰尼家族合作--他们会想要许可任何受欢迎的行为--或者你鄙视龙纹家族放弃阿伦纳尔，拒绝与他们合作？",
	"Being considered a folk hero in Aerenal won't do you much good if you're adventuring in Khorvaire. The question is what you've done {@i since} arriving in Khorvaire to earn this reputation... and just as important, why. What is it that would drive you to fight for the common people of a distant land? Is it tied to the reason you left Aerenal? Are you just an altruist, or have you carefully constructed your identity as a folk hero as part of some grand design that could take a century to bear fruit?": "如果你在Khorvaire冒险，在Aerenal被认为是一个民间英雄对你没有什么好处。问题是你到了霍尔韦尔后做了什么（%0%）来赢得这个声誉......同样重要的是，为什么。是什么促使你为一个遥远的地方的普通人而战？它与你离开阿伦纳的原因有关吗？你只是一个利他主义者，还是你精心构建了你作为民间英雄的身份，作为一些可能需要一个世纪才能开花结果的宏伟设计的一部分？",
	"Both of these are sound paths for Aereni. An Aereni scholar could make an excellent sage. As a hermit, you may have had a vision from the Undying Court or a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy that has led you to distant lands.": "这两点对Aereni来说都是合理的途径。一个Aereni学者可以成为一个优秀的圣人。作为一个隐士，你可能有来自不死宫廷的异象，或者瞥见了龙人的预言，从而将你带到了遥远的地方。",
	"As a member of a noble line, you weren't born to your position, you were raised into it. What did you do to earn this honor? You're seen as one of the most promising members of your line, but you're also expected to serve the interests of your line and your people; do you embrace this duty? While you may not be a noble of the Five Nations, most of the nations of Khorvaire show great respect to Aereni nobles, and your Position of Privilege should still open doors in high society": "作为一个贵族家族的成员，你不是生来就有这个地位的，你是被养成的。你做了什么来赢得这个荣誉？你被视为你的家族中最有前途的成员之一，但你也被期望为你的家族和你的人民的利益服务；你是否接受这一职责？虽然你可能不是五国的贵族，但霍尔韦尔的大多数国家都对艾瑞尼贵族表现出极大的尊重，你的特权地位仍然可以在上流社会打开大门。",
	"The line of Melideth are the sailors of the Aereni. While Aerenal has little interest in exploration and remained neutral in the Last War, Melideth traders can be found across the seas.": "梅利达斯一系是艾瑞尼的水手。虽然艾瑞尼对探索没有什么兴趣，并在最后一次战争中保持中立，但在大洋彼岸可以找到梅利达斯商人。",
	"You may have served in the armed forces of your line, or you might be a member of the Deathguard, the elite military force tasked to eliminate negative undead (a logical background for a cleric or paladin). Your rank will likely be recognized by any loyal citizen of Aerenal. While you have no authority in the Five Nations, officers may at least respect you as a fellow soldier. On the other hand, as an elf, you've had a long life; it could be that you left Aerenal a decade or two ago and served with one of the Five Nations. If so, what drew you into the war? How does your family feel about your actions?": "你可能曾在你的家族的武装力量中服役，或者你可能是死亡守卫的成员，这是一支负责消除负面不死生物的精英军队（对于牧师或圣骑士来说是一个合理的背景）。你的等级可能会被任何忠诚的艾瑞纳公民所认可。虽然你在五国中没有权力，但官员们至少会把你当作同胞士兵来尊重。另一方面，作为一个精灵，你已经有了很长的生命；可能你在一二十年前就离开了Aerenal，在五国之一服役。如果是这样，是什么吸引你加入战争的？你的家人对你的行为有什么看法？",
	"The {@background far traveler|scag} and {@background inheritor|scag} backgrounds from the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag} are sound choices for an Aereni elf. The {@background haunted one|cos} background from {@adventure Curse of Strahd|cos} could reflect something you saw in the Mabaran manifest zones of your homeland—or you could be literally haunted by an ancestor.": "来自{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}的{@background far traveler|scag}和{@background inheritor|scag}的背景是一个Aereni精灵的合理选择。来自{@adventure Curse of Strahd|cos}的{@background haunted one|cos}背景可以反映出你在家乡的马巴兰宣言区看到的东西，或者你可能真的被一个祖先缠住了。",
	"The Aereni are the dominant culture of Aerenal. The Tairnadal are a separate culture that came to Aerenal during the exodus and laid claim to the northern steppes. Rather than preserving their ancestors as deathless or {@i spirit idols}, the Tairnadal believe they anchor their ancestors by emulating their heroic deeds.": "艾瑞尼人是艾瑞纳尔的主流文化。泰尔纳达尔人是一种独立的文化，他们在逃亡期间来到艾瑞纳尔，并对北部草原提出了要求。泰尔纳达尔人认为，他们不是把自己的祖先当作不死之身或（%0%）来保存，而是通过模仿他们的英雄事迹来固定祖先。",
	"The Tairnadal have a long alliance with the Aereni and fight alongside their cousins when the island is threatened. It's possible for elves to immigrate from one culture to another; the line of Tolaen is known for having close ties to the Tairnadal. But they're separate cultures; the Tairnadal don't worship the Undying Court and its warriors don't become deathless.": "泰尔纳达尔人与艾瑞尼人长期结盟，当岛屿受到威胁时与他们的表亲并肩作战。精灵有可能从一种文化移民到另一种文化；托拉恩一系因与泰尔纳达尔有密切联系而闻名。但它们是独立的文化；泰尔纳达尔人不崇拜不朽之庭，它的战士也不会变成不死之身。",
	"You were born with a bond to an otherworldly being. You have memories of a life you've never lived, visions of battling fiends and an endless struggle against darkness. When you sleep, you don't dream as others do, but you often wake with a sense of purpose or new ideas. You see the pain and suffering in the world and know that there is a path to light—but there are monsters in the shadows, faceless enemies that have been hunting you since before you were born.": "你出生时就与一个异世界的存在有联系。你有关于你从未经历过的生活的记忆，有与恶魔战斗的幻觉，有与黑暗的无尽斗争。当你睡觉时，你不像其他人那样做梦，但你经常带着目的感或新想法醒来。你看到世界上的痛苦和磨难，知道有一条通往光明的道路--但阴影中还有怪物，那些不露面的敌人从你出生前就一直在追捕你。",
	"Will you embrace the spirit within you and make its struggle your own? Will you stand against the darkness, even if it draws the many eyes of the Dreaming Dark upon you? Or will you ignore that inner voice and try to live your own life?": "你是否会拥抱你内心的精神，并把它的斗争作为你自己的斗争？你是否会站在黑暗的对立面，即使它吸引了许多梦想中的黑暗的眼睛来关注你？或者，你会无视那内心的声音，试图过你自己的生活吗？",
	"The quori are spirits of nightmare. But just as angels can fall, fiends can rise. Centuries ago, a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that dominates Dal Quor. The Dreaming Dark hunted them across the dreamscape, seeking to consume and reclaim them. In desperation, these rebel spirits reached out to Eberron, finding a haven in the minds and bodies of a group of Adaran monks. Sixty-seven spirits escaped, and the first kalashtar were born.": "科里是噩梦的灵魂。但就像天使会堕落一样，恶魔也会崛起。几个世纪前，一小撮科里人背叛了主宰达尔-库尔的邪恶力量il-Lashtavar。梦中的黑暗在整个梦境中追捕他们，试图吞噬并夺回他们。在绝望中，这些反叛的灵魂向艾伯伦伸出了援手，在一群阿达兰僧侣的思想和身体中找到了庇护所。六十七个灵魂逃了出来，第一批卡拉斯塔诞生了。",
	"As a kalashtar, you're descended from one of these monks. A quori is bound to your bloodline. It exists in the minds and dreams of all of your siblings, and as long as one of you is alive the quori is sustained. Should you all die, the spirit will be lost... and so, the Dreaming Dark is always happy to kill a kalashtar.": "作为一个卡拉什塔，你是这些僧侣中的一个的后代。Quori与你的血脉紧密相连。它存在于你所有兄弟姐妹的思想和梦境中，只要你们中的一个人活着，就能维持 \"魁力\"。如果你们都死了，精神就会丧失......因此，做梦的黑暗总是很高兴能杀死一个卡拉什塔。",
	"The kalashtar were born centuries ago, and have since spread out from Adar. What is your background? What has set you on the path to adventure? Are you searching for allies against the Dreaming Dark, or are you pursuing a mission of your own?": "卡拉什塔人诞生于几个世纪前，此后从阿达尔扩散出去。你的背景是什么？是什么让你走上了冒险的道路？你是在寻找对抗梦幻黑暗的盟友，还是在追求你自己的使命？",
	"The kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won't be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light.": "卡拉斯塔人出生在遥远的亚达大陆的萨洛纳。今天，里德拉帝国统治着萨洛纳，帝国军队无休止地围攻阿达尔。阿达尔的僧侣和祭司们相信，与启发者和il-Lashtavar的战争不会靠武器取胜；相反，祈祷和指导冥想将最终把平衡从黑暗转向光明。",
	"Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. If you are from Adar, what caused you to leave your monastery and brave the Riedran blockades? Have the elders entrusted you with a specific mission, or has your quori spirit driven you to distant lands? The hermit background is a good way to reflect a mystic from a distant land possessing dangerous revelations.": "阿达兰卡拉斯塔很少无缘无故地采取直接行动。如果你来自阿达，是什么原因导致你离开你的修道院，勇敢面对里德兰的封锁？是长老们委托你去完成一个特定的任务，还是你的夸里精神驱使你去遥远的地方？隐士背景是反映一个来自远方拥有危险启示的神秘主义者的好方法。",
	"Of all the origins mentioned here, you likely have the strongest connection to your quori spirit. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. You were taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness; can you reconcile this with your adventuring life? If you've recently arrived in Khorvaire after living your life in a monastery, you are unaccustomed to crime and greed. Is the chaos of a city like Sharn disorienting?": "在这里提到的所有起源中，你很可能与你的奎里精神有最强的联系。Adaran kalashtar是禁欲主义者，有纪律，专注于光明之路。你被教导要激励那些生活在恐惧中的人，启迪那些迷失在黑暗中的人；你能把这一点与你的冒险生活相协调吗？如果你在修道院生活后最近才来到霍尔韦尔，你不习惯犯罪和贪婪。像沙恩这样混乱的城市是否让人迷失方向？",
	"There are kalashtar communities in several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. Kalashtar prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. If you were raised in such a community, you're familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there's no Riedran army at the gates; you know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it's a ghost in the shadows.": "在五国的几个主要城市都有卡拉什塔社区，包括沙恩的眺望区和费尔海文的白墙。卡拉什塔人喜欢彼此靠近，既是为了实践他们共同的传统，也是为了共同抵御任何由梦幻黑暗构成的威胁。如果你在这样的社区长大，你就会熟悉光明之路和其他卡拉什塔人的习俗。但门口没有瑞德兰军队；你知道逐梦的黑暗是一种威胁，但它是阴影中的一个幽灵。",
	"Many kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don't believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and to ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher's focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.": "许多卡拉什塔只是想通过他们的日常行为来传播光明，例如表现出仁慈和同情心或调解争端。另一方面，霍尔韦尔的一些卡拉什塔人在与黑暗的斗争中走上了一条残酷的道路。影子守望者不相信邪恶可以仅仅通过仁慈和祈祷来对抗。这个组织的成员寻求确定腐败的来源，并无情地消除它们。虽然暗影监视者的重点是梦幻黑暗的代理人，但他们可以追捕任何邪恶的力量，无论是超自然的还是其他的。",
	"As a kalashtar of Khorvaire, you could bring a compassionate approach to any background; whether you're an acolyte of the Path of Light, a wise sage, or a lively entertainer, you do your best to help the innocent and lift spirits. Criminal and charlatan would be unusual paths, but the spy background could reflect the work of a Shadow Watcher. While you aren't as isolated from the world as an Adaran kalashtar, you're still guided by alien instincts and have an otherworldly demeanor.": "作为霍尔韦尔的卡拉什塔，你可以为任何背景带来一种同情心；无论你是光明之路的信徒、明智的圣人，还是活泼的艺人，你都会尽力帮助无辜的人，提升精神。犯罪分子和江湖术士将是不寻常的道路，但间谍背景可以反映出影子监视者的工作。虽然你不像阿达兰-卡拉什塔人那样与世隔绝，但你仍然被外星的本能所引导，并有一种异世界的气质。",
	"Kalashtar can breed with humans and half-elves, and their children have an equal chance of being fully kalashtar or the race of the other parent. Kalashtar are quite rare; even in cities like Sharn with kalashtar communities, there are many people who will assume kalashtar are just humans with strange eyes... or some sort of half-elf, maybe? Maybe it's a new fashion?": "卡拉什塔人可以与人类和半精灵交配，他们的孩子有同样的机会成为完全的卡拉什塔人或另一个父母的种族。卡拉什塔人相当罕见；即使在像沙恩这样有卡拉什塔人社区的城市，也有很多人会认为卡拉什塔人只是有奇怪眼睛的人类......或者某种半精灵，也许？也许这是一种新的时尚？",
	"As such, there are kalashtar in Khorvaire who grew up without the guidance of a kalashtar parent. Orphans may be entirely unaware of their heritage and the nature of their quori spirit—it tries to communicate through dream-visions and instincts, but lacking any context, such orphans rarely understand their quori bond. Nonetheless, the quori is an integral part of them, urging them toward the light—and indeed, most orphans follow such a path. A kalashtar orphan who chooses a darker path is fighting the instincts imparted by their spirit. Such a kalashtar is likely to be deeply conflicted, which can manifest as unidentified stress, fits of rage, depression, or unpredictable behavior.": "因此，在Khorvaire有一些卡拉什塔人，他们在没有卡拉什塔人父母的指导下成长起来。孤儿们可能完全不知道他们的遗产和他们的quori精神的性质--它试图通过梦境和本能来沟通，但由于缺乏任何背景，这些孤儿很少理解他们的quori纽带。尽管如此，\"魁力 \"是他们不可分割的一部分，敦促他们走向光明--事实上，大多数孤儿都走上了这样一条道路。一个选择黑暗道路的卡拉什塔孤儿是在与他们的精神所赋予的本能作斗争。这样的卡拉什塔人可能会有很深的冲突，这可以表现为不明的压力、愤怒、抑郁或不可预测的行为。",
	"An orphan kalashtar can follow any path. Whether altruistic, nefarious, or somewhere in between, work with your DM to decide how you interpret the influence of your quori bond. Have you followed its guidance despite not knowing its true nature? Do you interpret it as a curse or ghost, twisting your thoughts and putting you at odds with yourself? Have you found the inner determination to suppress it entirely? Do you ultimately want to come to terms with your kalashtar nature, or do you like being an outsider and prefer to stay that way?": "一个孤儿卡拉什塔可以走任何道路。无论是利他主义的、邪恶的，还是介于两者之间的，请与你的DM合作，决定你如何解释你的Qori纽带的影响。尽管你不知道它的真实性质，但你是否遵循它的指导？你是否把它解释为一种诅咒或幽灵，扭曲你的思想，使你与自己产生矛盾？你是否找到了完全压制它的内在决心？你最终是想接受你的卡拉什塔本性，还是喜欢做一个局外人，并宁愿保持这种状态？",
	"As a kalashtar, you're part of a spiritual lineage, traditionally reflected by the suffix of your name. For example, Lanhareth and Minhareth are both kalashtar of the lineage of Hareth. Your lineage is set before birth, tied to one of your parents. If you are born to kalashtar of Vaktri and Hareth, you inherit only one of the bonds, often that of the parent of your gender. Since you can't inherit both bonds, you won't be half Hareth and half Vaktri. Your lineage affects your appearance and personality, eye color, hair color, and other aspects. When you meet another kalashtar of your lineage, you'll see common traits, but you'll also feel a deeper connection; in some ways, you're one person.": "作为卡拉什塔，你是精神世系的一部分，传统上由你名字的后缀反映。例如，Lanhareth和Minhareth都是Hareth血统的卡拉什塔人。你的血统在出生前就已确定，与你的父母之一联系在一起。如果你是由瓦克特里和哈雷斯的卡拉什塔所生，你只能继承其中一个纽带，通常是你性别的父母的纽带。由于你不能同时继承两种纽带，所以你不会是一半哈雷斯和一半瓦克特里。你的血统会影响你的外表和性格、眼睛颜色、头发颜色和其他方面。当你遇到另一个与你同一血统的卡拉什塔，你会看到共同的特征，但你也会感到更深的联系；在某些方面，你们是一个人。",
	"The quori bond exists on a deep level. Your quori doesn't hover over your shoulder or whisper in your ear. Instead, it exists in the collective subconscious of all kalashtar of your lineage, shaping and guiding you all. You feel it as instinct, in memories of things you've never done—visions of a war in the realm of dreams. When you sleep, you don't dream, but the bond grows stronger. Your quori may even give visions to guide you. With time and training, you can strengthen this connection, learning to hear its psychic voice more clearly; the Quori Bond feat presented in chapter 6 is one way to reflect this stronger bond. Ultimately, it's up to you how you roleplay your connection. While the quori isn't an active presence that responds in conversation, some kalashtar do speak to it as if it was, talking with the quori as a way of processing their own thoughts. Others take comfort in its subconscious presence, confident it is with them at all times. And some—notably orphans—refuse to acknowledge it, determined to see their mind as their own.": "魁北克的关系存在于一个很深的层次。你的quori不会在你的肩膀上盘旋或在你耳边低语。相反，它存在于你的血统中所有卡拉什塔人的集体潜意识中，塑造并指导着你们所有人。你觉得它是一种本能，在你从未做过的事情的记忆中--在梦境中的战争预想。当你睡觉时，你不会做梦，但这种联系却越来越强。你的奎里甚至会发出幻觉来引导你。随着时间的推移和训练，你可以加强这种联系，学会更清楚地听到它的心灵之声；第6章中介绍的Quori Bond壮举是反映这种更强联系的一种方式。归根结底，这取决于你如何扮演你的联系。虽然Quori并不是一个能在对话中做出反应的主动存在，但一些卡拉什塔人确实像它一样与它对话，把与Quori对话作为处理他们自己想法的一种方式。其他人则对它的潜意识存在感到安慰，相信它一直与他们在一起。而有些人--特别是孤儿--拒绝承认它，决心把自己的思想看作是自己的。",
	"In creating a kalashtar character, it's important to consider what type of quori you're bound to. You can develop this through roleplaying, but it can also be reflected by your choice of class and by your abilities or spells. Each quori has a connection to a particular emotion. Fiendish quori feed on this emotion, using it to manipulate mortals. In your case, it could be that you understand how to generate that emotion in others, or that you yourself experience that emotion in a deep and powerful way. Or it could be that you have learned how to suppress that emotion, and that is the source of your strength. Whatever choice you make, it will be reflected throughout your lineage. If you decide that Vaktri is a du'ulora quori and that you draw on his burning fury to produce your own barbarian rage, then other Vaktri kalashtar you meet may also be barbarians or furious warriors.": "在创建一个卡拉什塔角色时，重要的是要考虑你与哪种类型的奎里有缘。你可以通过角色扮演来发展这一点，但它也可以通过你选择的等级和你的能力或法术来反映。每一个quori都与一种特定的情感有联系。邪恶的奎里以这种情感为食，利用它来操纵凡人。就你而言，你可能了解如何在他人身上产生这种情感，或者你自己以一种深刻而强大的方式体验到这种情感。也可能是你已经学会了如何压制这种情绪，而这就是你力量的来源。无论你做出什么选择，它都会反映在你的整个血统中。如果你决定瓦克特里是一个du'ulora quori，并且你从他燃烧的愤怒中汲取营养，产生你自己的野蛮人的愤怒，那么你遇到的其他瓦克特里卡拉什塔也可能是野蛮人或愤怒的战士。",
	"The three quori presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} are described below, along with another fourth common quori, the du'ulora, whose statistics are presented in chapter 8.

	"The fiendish du'ulora are spirits of rage and aggression. In Dal Quor, they craft dreams that drive feuds and vendettas, spurring mortals to violence and vengeance. Your du'ulora spirit has turned against the darkness, but fury remains its domain and anger is your birthright. How do you express this? As a bard, you might specialize in taunting enemies, turning their anger against them and driving them to rash action. As a barbarian, you could say that your spirit is the source of your rage. As a paladin, you might channel its fury when you smite your foes. You might be calm and serene most of the time, expressing sudden powerful moments of rage when you draw on your bond.": "邪恶的杜罗拉是愤怒和侵略的灵魂。在达尔-库尔，他们制作的梦境推动着仇怨和报复，刺激着凡人的暴力和复仇。你的du'ulora精神已经转向反对黑暗，但愤怒仍然是它的领域，愤怒是你的天赋权利。你如何表达这个？作为一个吟游诗人，你可能擅长嘲弄敌人，将他们的愤怒转向他们，促使他们采取轻率的行动。作为一个野蛮人，你可以说你的精神是你愤怒的源泉。作为一个圣骑士，你可能会在打击敌人时引导它的怒火。你可能在大多数时候都是平静安详的，当你利用你的纽带时，会突然表达出强大的愤怒。",
	"The key thing to remember is that your du'ulora has chosen the path of light, even if it is a spirit of rage. You may revel in moments when you get to unleash your anger on your enemies, but it still drives you to fight for a noble cause. Your fury is a tool, and you should never let it drag you into darkness.": "要记住的关键是，你的du'ulora已经选择了光明的道路，即使是愤怒的精神。你可能会陶醉在对敌人释放愤怒的时刻，但它仍然促使你为崇高的事业而战。你的愤怒是一种工具，你不应该让它把你拖入黑暗。",
	"The hashalaq are seducers and deceivers, feeding on doubt and desire. They are the spies and loremasters of the quori. Hashalaq kalashtar make excellent bards; the College of Lore reflects both your love of knowledge and your ability to confuse your foes. Hashalaq make excellent warlocks, with your spirit granting the {@optfeature Beguiling Influence} invocation and allowing you to charm your enemies. As a hashalaq kalashtar, consider whether you specialize in deception, or choose to be honest and focus on your ability to inspire positive emotion—do you prefer cunning {@skill Deception} or empathic {@skill Persuasion}? Hashalaq clerics typically follow this latter path, using their knowledge to guide allies and cut through the deception that comes so naturally to their kind.": "哈撒拉克是诱惑者和欺骗者，以怀疑和欲望为食。他们是科里人的间谍和传说家。哈沙拉克-卡拉什塔是优秀的吟游诗人；传说学院反映了你对知识的热爱和你迷惑敌人的能力。哈沙拉克人是优秀的术士，你的精神赋予了{@optfeature Beguiling Influence}召唤术，并允许你迷惑你的敌人。作为一个哈沙拉克的卡拉什塔，请考虑你是专攻欺骗，还是选择诚实，专注于你激发积极情感的能力--你是喜欢狡猾的（%1%）还是同情的（%2%）？哈沙拉克教士通常走后一条路，用他们的知识来引导盟友，并穿过对他们来说很自然的欺骗。",
	"The kalaraq are spirits of pride and ambition. The natural leaders of the quori, they dominate through sheer charisma and force of will. As a kalaraq kalashtar, you surely have your own grand ambitions. You excel at inspiring others to follow you and you won't hesitate to take bold action. You might lead in the vanguard as a paladin, or strengthen your allies as a cleric, or bend enemies to your will as a bard of the {@class bard||College of Glamour|glamour|XGE}.

	"The kalaraq are the rarest and most powerful of the quori. The kalaraq Taratai was the leader of the rebels, and hers is the only spiritual lineage that has been completely destroyed by Dreaming Dark; Taratai's own fate is unknown.

	"The tsucora feed on terror and craft the most classic nightmares. As a tsucora kalashtar, you have a deep understanding of fear.

Tsucora kalashtar often seem cold and intimidating, but despite your knowledge of nightmares, you are still looking toward the light.": "tsucora以恐怖为生，制作最经典的恶梦。作为一个tsucora kalashtar，你对恐惧有深刻的理解。这为低语学院的吟游诗人或活体武器修士（第六章）打下了良好的基础，用一句话或一个触摸来播撒恐惧。同样地，你也可以成为一个（%0%）用恐惧和不和谐的低语折磨你的敌人。另一方面，你也可以走鼓舞人心的牧师之路，用你对恐惧的了解来加强你的盟友的决心。津科拉-卡拉什塔经常显得冷酷和令人生畏，但尽管你对恶梦有所了解，你仍然在向着光明。",
	"Kalashtar are known for their psychic gifts, but aside from their Mind Link, how does this manifest in a kalashtar character? In fifth edition, how do they wield mental power? Chapter 6 presents a Mind Domain cleric and two kalashtar racial feats. In addition, characters carry an innate sense of mental discipline—a kalashtar monk could consider ki as a representation of psionic ability, and the Living Weapon monastic tradition in chapter 6 builds on this. But you can also change the flavor of a class without altering the mechanics. Consider the following ideas.": "Kalashtar以他们的精神天赋而闻名，但除了他们的心灵链接外，这在Kalashtar角色中是如何体现的？在第五版中，他们是如何挥舞精神力量的？第6章介绍了一个心灵领域的牧师和两个卡拉什塔人的种族特技。此外，角色还带有一种与生俱来的精神纪律感--卡拉什塔僧侣可以将ki视为幻术能力的代表，而第六章中的活体武器僧侣传统则是建立在这个基础之上的。但你也可以在不改变机制的情况下改变一个类别的味道。请考虑以下想法。",
	"Many kalashtar seek to fight evil through inspiration, and the bard can be an excellent foundation for this. While Bardic Inspiration is described as \"stirring words or music,\" you can describe your actions as being tied to psychic gifts; instead of a mystical song, you could describe your inspiration as a word backed by a surge of psychic energy. When you use the Words of Terror of the {@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE} or the Cutting Words of the {@class bard||College of Lore|lore}, this could easily reflect your powers of psychic manipulation. Likewise, your spellcasting is mechanically magic; it can be counterspelled, it won't work in an {@spell antimagic field}, and so on. But you can easily describe {@spell vicious mockery} or {@spell crown of madness} as psychic attacks, or present {@spell cure wounds} as a psychometabolic effect, using your mind to knit together the wounds of another. You gain no mechanical advantage from this—in the case of Bardic Inspiration, your target still has to be able to hear you, even if you're using psychic power—but there's nothing preventing you from presenting your bard as being psychically gifted as opposed to singing magic songs.": "许多卡拉什塔人寻求通过灵感来对抗邪恶，而吟游诗人可以成为这方面的一个很好的基础。虽然吟游诗人的灵感被描述为 \"激动人心的话语或音乐\"，但你可以把你的行动描述为与灵性的天赋联系在一起；而不是一首神秘的歌曲，你可以把你的灵感描述为由涌动的灵性能量支持的一个词。当你使用{@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}的恐怖之语或{@class bard||College of Lore|lore}的切割之语时，这很容易反映出你的精神操纵能力。同样地，你的咒语是机械性的魔法；它可以被反咒，在（%2%）的情况下不会起作用，等等。但你可以很容易地将（3%）或（4%）描述为精神攻击，或将（5%）呈现为精神代谢效果，用你的思想将他人的伤口编织起来。你没有从中获得任何机械优势--就吟游诗人的灵感而言，你的目标仍然必须能够听到你的声音，即使你使用的是精神力量--但没有什么能阻止你把吟游诗人说成是有精神天赋的，而不是唱魔法歌曲。",
	"Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic. Priests of the Path of Light say that the faithful are inspired by il-Yannah—the great light that will one day rise to replace the Dreaming Dark—but their power comes from within. As such, both cleric and paladin are logical paths for a kalashtar, and you can add psychic flavor to your spells as described with the bard above. When you cast {@spell command}, you aren't demanding your victim bow to il-Yannah; instead, il-Yannah is strengthening your mind and allowing you to impose your will on the target. Effects such as {@spell bless} could reflect your ongoing psychic guidance, while {@spell cure wounds} and similar spells could be psychometabolic. Your faith helps you focus your mind, but it's your mind that generates the power. If you want to take this farther, the {@class cleric||Mind domain|mind|ExploringEberron} presented in chapter 6 allows you to replace radiant damage with psychic damage; thus, you can flavor your {@spell sacred flame} as a psionic blast instead of holy fire.": "大多数卡拉什塔人都献身于光明之路，虽然它的信徒不崇拜任何神灵，但信仰本身可以成为神圣魔法的来源。光明之路的牧师们说，信徒们受到了伊尔-雅娜的启发--有朝一日会崛起取代梦幻黑暗的伟大之光--但他们的力量来自于内心。因此，牧师和圣骑士都是卡拉斯塔的合理途径，你可以像上面吟游诗人所描述的那样为你的法术添加灵性的味道。当你施展（%0%）时，你并没有要求你的受害者向il-Yannah鞠躬；相反，il-Yannah正在加强你的思想，并允许你将你的意志强加给目标。诸如(1%)这样的效果可以反映出你正在进行的精神指导，而(2%)和类似的法术可能是精神代谢。你的信仰帮助你集中精神，但产生力量的是你的思想。如果你想走得更远，第六章中介绍的{@class cleric||Mind domain|mind|ExploringEberron}允许你用精神伤害取代辐射伤害；因此，你可以把你的{@spell sacred flame}当作幻象爆炸而不是圣火。",
	"This same concept can work for a {@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE} sorcerer. You don't use the trappings of a priest, but your visions of il-Yannah have allowed you to focus your mind and alter reality. You can select spells that feel like they could be psychic powers; when you cast mage hand, it can be flavored as an act of telekinesis.": "这个概念同样可以适用于{@class sorcerer||Divine Soul|divine soul|XGE}巫师。你不使用牧师的外衣，但你对il-Yannah的幻觉使你能够集中精神并改变现实。你可以选择那些感觉像是通灵能力的法术；当你施展法师之手时，它可以被调味成心灵感应的行为。",
	"You can simply describe your warlock spells as being drawn from psychic power as opposed to arcane invocations. Your patron is your quori spirit. As a warlock, you might have an especially strong bond to this spirit and receive clearer visions than most kalashtar of your lineage; traditionally, kalashtar with such a strong connection are called atavists. The {@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one} is an easy choice, as many of its spells reflect mental manipulation; you can describe {@spell Evard's black tentacles} as ectoplasmic projections, or {@spell armor of Agathys} as a blend of telekinetic force and cryokinesis. The Awakened Mind feature soon becomes obsolete due to Mind Link; a DM could choose to combine the two, increasing the range of a kalashtar warlock's Mind Link feature by 30 feet. The {@class warlock||Celestial|celestial|XGE} patron is another logical choice, focusing on your quori as a spirit of light. As a {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE} or any warlock using the {@optfeature Pact of the Blade}, you can describe your weapon as being forged from nightmares.": "你可以简单地将你的术士法术描述为来自精神力量，而不是奥术召唤。你的守护者是你的奎里精神。作为一个术士，你可能与这个精神有特别强烈的联系，并且比你的血统中的大多数卡拉什塔人得到更清晰的视野；传统上，具有这种强烈联系的卡拉什塔人被称为阿塔夫。{@class warlock||Great Old One|great old one}是一个简单的选择，因为它的许多法术都反映了精神操纵；你可以把{@spell Evard's black tentacles}描述为外质投影，或者{@spell armor of Agathys}描述为心灵感应和低温运动的混合。由于心灵链接的存在，觉醒的心灵功能很快就会被淘汰；DM可以选择将两者结合起来，将卡拉什塔术士的心灵链接功能的范围增加30英尺。{@class warlock||Celestial|celestial|XGE}的守护者是另一个合理的选择，专注于你作为光之精灵的quori。作为{@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}或任何使用{@optfeature Pact of the Blade}的术士，你可以将你的武器描述为由噩梦铸成。",
	"If you want to add more psionic flavor to your warlock, your DM might allow you to shift the damage type of a few of your spells; could {@spell eldritch blast} inflict psychic damage? And even with default rules, you can roleplay it as a burst of telekinetic force.": "如果你想给你的术士添加更多的幻觉味道，你的管理员可能会允许你改变一些法术的伤害类型；可以（%0%）造成精神伤害？即使使用默认规则，你也可以把它当作心灵感应的爆发来进行角色扮演。",

	"{@b Lurashtai} began her existence as a tsucora quori. She wove dreams of gothic horror, playing on her victims' fears of death and the undead. Raised on these morbid memories, the kalashtar of her line are comfortable with tragedy, have no fear of death, and see beauty in things that others find disturbing or terrifying. As a spirit of light, Lurashtai has taken an interest in the undead; she fears that by being trapped outside the cycle of life and dream, the undead weaken the shared soul of the age. As a result, the kalashtar of her line are often driven to hunt undead and lay their spirits to rest. Lurashtai kalashtar usually have pale complexions, sharp features, and silky, dark hair; they generally favor the color red in their clothing.": "{@b Lurashtai}开始她的存在是作为一个tsucora quori。她编织着哥特式恐怖的梦境，利用受害者对死亡和亡灵的恐惧。在这些病态的记忆中长大，她那一系的卡拉什塔对悲剧感到舒服，对死亡没有恐惧，并在别人认为令人不安或可怕的事物中看到了美。作为一个光之精灵，露拉丝泰对亡灵产生了兴趣；她担心，由于被困在生命和梦想的循环之外，亡灵会削弱这个时代的共同灵魂。因此，她这一系的卡拉什塔人经常被驱使去猎杀亡灵，让他们的灵魂安息。卢拉什泰-卡拉什塔通常有苍白的肤色，尖锐的特征，以及丝质的黑发；他们一般喜欢红色的衣服。",
	"{@b Aveth}, a hashalaq quori, wielded the twin weapons of manipulation and insight before his exodus from Dal Quor. He takes great interest in the potential that mortals hold to choose a nobler path, much as he and his kind fled Darkness in search of Light. The kalashtar of Aveth's line prefer following their intuition over the careful planning of others. They have great confidence in their ability to win over potential foes, turning them into friends, which can yield unexpected allies—or the untimely death of the too-optimistic kalashtar. Aveth kalashtar usually have dark skin, black hair, a preference for blue and aquamarine, and a distinct dislike of peanuts.": "{@b Aveth}，一个hashalaq quori，在他离开Dal Quor之前挥舞着操纵和洞察的双重武器。他对凡人选择更高尚道路的潜力非常感兴趣，就像他和他的同类逃离黑暗去寻找光明一样。阿维斯一系的卡拉什塔人更喜欢遵循他们的直觉，而不是其他人的精心策划。他们对自己战胜潜在敌人的能力非常有信心，将他们变成朋友，这可能会产生意想不到的盟友--或者是过于乐观的卡拉什塔人的过早死亡。阿维斯-卡拉什塔通常有黑色的皮肤，黑色的头发，喜欢蓝色和海蓝色，并且明显不喜欢花生。",
	"As a shifter adventurer, you walk a path between the wilds and the civilized world. You are driven by primal instincts, the whispers of Wolf or Rat. When you embrace those voices, you transform. Do you see your shift-form as your true self, reveling in these moments of primal ascension? Or do you hate shifting, fearing that you might one day lose yourself to the beast within?": "作为一个变身者的冒险者，你走在荒野和文明世界之间的路上。你被原始的本能所驱使，狼或鼠的低语。当你接受这些声音时，你就会转变。你是否将你的转变形态视为真正的自我，陶醉于这些原始的升华时刻？还是你讨厌转变，担心有一天你会被内心的野兽所迷惑？",

	"Shifters are relatively rare in the Five Nations; there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters. The bulk of the shifter population of Khorvaire is based in the Towering Wood, the vast forest that stretches across the northwest. Over the last four decades, shifters have emerged from the deep woods to live in the farmlands of the Eldeen Reaches, shaping the culture of this new nation. Outside the Towering Wood, many shifters fled the violence and persecution of the Silver Crusade, leading to their scattering across the Five Nations. While the hysteria of the Silver Crusade has long since died down, there are still many who treat shifters with fear or suspicion. {@i They're weretouched, more beast than human. They're prone to violence—they can't help it. Don't they become dangerous when the moons are full?}": "变形人在五国中相对罕见；布雷兰的变形人比变形人更多。霍尔韦尔的大部分变身者都在高耸的森林里，那是横跨西北部的巨大森林。在过去的四十年里，变身者从深山老林里走出来，生活在Eldeen Reaches的农田里，塑造了这个新国家的文化。在高耸的森林之外，许多变身者逃离了白银十字军的暴力和迫害，导致他们散落在五国之间。虽然白银十字军的歇斯底里早已平息，但仍有许多人以恐惧或怀疑的态度对待变身者。{@i They're weretouched, more beast than human. They're prone to violence—they can't help it. Don't they become dangerous when the moons are full?}",
	"As a shifter character, you don't have to be tied to a shifter community.

	"The shifters of the Towering Wood, nomadic hunter-gatherers, follow the same traditions that have sustained their people for millennia. Their champions are druids, rangers, and barbarians, and they are attuned to the beast within. But they know almost nothing about the world beyond the wood and have little experience with artifice or the wonders of the dragonmarked houses. If you're from such a tribe, what drove you to leave the woods? Are you following a druidic prophecy? Pursuing an ancient evil that's escaped from the wood? Have you been exiled from your tribe, or are you simply driven by curiosity? Outlander and hermit are both logical backgrounds for such a character.": "塔林的变身者是游牧的狩猎采集者，他们遵循的传统已经支撑了他们的人民几千年。他们的拥护者是德鲁伊、游骑兵和野蛮人，他们与内心的野兽相适应。但他们对森林之外的世界几乎一无所知，对人工制品或龙纹屋的奇迹也没有什么经验。如果你来自这样一个部落，是什么驱使你离开森林？你是在遵循德鲁伊的预言吗？是在追寻一个从森林里逃出来的古老恶魔？你是否被流放出你的部落，或者你只是被好奇心所驱使？外乡人和隐士都是这样一个角色的合乎逻辑的背景。",

Young shifters have the same general phenotype, but as a child you find your beast within; this sets your subrace, triggering physical and psychological changes.

Shifters have affinities for bear, boar, rat, and wolf; could it be mere coincidence that these are the most common forms of lycanthrope? And yet, the differences between shifter and lycanthrope are vast. Being a shifter isn't a condition that can be passed by a bite. Shifters have full control over their gifts, while lycanthropes struggle with them. The beast within may shape a shifter's personality, but it doesn't overwhelm it. By contrast, lycanthropy attempts to destroy the victim's original personality and can turn the most virtuous hero into a bloodthirsty murderer. Wererats and werewolves are cruel killers... but Grandmother Wolf doesn't encourage savagery, and Grandfather Rat doesn't urge murder.

	"The Moonspeaker druids tell a tale of five shifter champions who ventured too deep into the Towering Woods. They hunted a great evil, but when they caught it, they were overwhelmed; its evil filled their hearts, and it sent them back to prey on their friends and families.

	"The Silver Crusade began when a dark power surged in the Towering Wood, amplifying the power of lycanthropy. The curse became more virulent. Victims fell prey to its power more quickly, guided by some dark power beyond the common evil of the curse. Within the Towering Woods, tribes of shifters fought their corrupted kin. Beyond it, the farmers of Aundair were tormented by raiding wolves and boars. When the templars responded, the beasts that were slain reverted to their natural forms, revealing that they were shifters. The word quickly spread: all shifters were weretouched, capable of turning into savage beasts. None could be trusted! Meanwhile, among the shifter tribes, scouts warned of atrocities committed by the foreign soldiers. In fact, the demagogues on both sides were wererats working to ensure that these possible allies would instead become bitter enemies... and the trick worked. Frightened templars and paranoid mobs slew many innocent shifters, and to this day the extremist sect known as the Pure Flame claims all shifters are servants of darkness.": "白银十字军开始时，一股黑暗的力量在高耸的森林中涌动，放大了狼人的力量。诅咒变得更加剧烈。受害者更快成为其力量的牺牲品，被某种黑暗的力量所引导，超越了诅咒的普通邪恶。在高耸的森林里，变种人部落与他们被腐蚀的亲属战斗。在它之外，昂代尔的农民们被突袭的狼和野猪折磨着。当圣殿骑士们做出反应时，被杀死的野兽恢复了它们的自然形态，显示出它们是变身者。消息很快传开了：所有的变身者都被感染了，能够变成野蛮的野兽。没有人可以信任! 同时，在变身者部落中，侦察员警告说，外国士兵犯下了暴行。事实上，双方的煽动者都在努力确保这些可能的盟友反而会成为痛苦的敌人......而且这招很有效。惊恐的圣殿骑士和偏执的暴徒杀害了许多无辜的变身者，直到今天，被称为 \"纯净火焰 \"的极端主义教派声称所有变身者都是黑暗的仆人。",
	"The fact of the matter is that {@i lycanthropy is a weapon}; it spreads through violence and turns its victims into killers. Its origins may never be discovered, but the Moonspeaker tale is as logical as any. Lycanthropes and shifters are related in that the first lycanthropes were cursed shifters. The unknown force responsible was likely also behind the surge that caused the Silver Crusade—and it could rise again. One logical contender is the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. It's said that Dyrrn created doppelgangers by twisting changelings; it could have used this same technique to create lycanthropes from shifters. Or it could have been the work of an overlord, an archfiend of the Age of Demons; some texts speak of the Wild Heart, an overlord who destroys civilizations and feeds on primal cruelty. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if the answer will be revealed, and if so, what it is. In battling the cults of the Dragon Below, could you face the original shifter champions corrupted by Dyrrn? Or might the schemes of the Lords of Dust unleash the Wild Heart?": "事实是，（%0%）；它通过暴力传播，把受害者变成杀手。它的起源可能永远不会被发现，但Moonspeaker的故事和其他故事一样符合逻辑。狼人和移居者是相关的，因为第一个狼人是被诅咒的移居者。负责的未知力量很可能也是导致银色十字军的激增的幕后推手--而且它可能再次崛起。一个合理的竞争者是被称为 \"腐蚀者Dyrrn \"的daelkyr。据说Dyrrn通过扭曲变种人创造了二重身；它可能用同样的技术从变种人中创造了狼人。也可能是一个霸主的杰作，一个恶魔时代的大恶魔；一些文本中提到了 \"野心\"，一个破坏文明并以原始的残忍为食的霸主。最终，将由DM来决定是否会揭晓答案，如果是的话，答案是什么。在与下面的龙的邪教斗争中，你能否面对被Dyrrn腐蚀的原始变身者冠军？或者尘土领主的计划可能会释放出野性之心？"
