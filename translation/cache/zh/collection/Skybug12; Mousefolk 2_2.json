A reverence for nature and life is close to the heart of Mousefolk, and they are loath to take a life if it can be avoided. They prefer to live quiet and unassuming lives, giving honest work for honest pay.": "大多数鼠族是中立的，并倾向于善良。他们试图与其他种族的冲突保持距离，但当他们的朋友、家庭或社区受到威胁时，就会表现出非凡的凶猛。对自然和生命的敬畏是鼠人的核心，如果可以避免，他们不愿意夺取生命。他们更喜欢过平静而不张扬的生活，为诚实的报酬付出诚实的工作。",

	"Obscured in the thick underbrush of the forest, every muscle in Moira's body was screaming. She had been crouched, completely still, for half a day, waiting for her quarry to emerge from its den. Thick mud clumped and matted her dark fur, insulating her from the high sun. Her large round ears twitched, focusing on a faint scratching coming from the cave. Her prey was awake. Moira drew her bow and deftly nocked an arrow without a sound. She waited. Soon the mighty owlbear lumbered out of the cave. A dry summer had forced it closer to civilization, and it had begun preying on trade caravans. Moira took aim, and let fly her arrow. The Barbed Trail would be safe to travel once more.": "在森林茂密的灌木丛中，莫伊拉身上的每一块肌肉都在尖叫着。她已经蹲在地上，一动不动地等了半天，等待她的猎物从洞穴里出来。厚厚的泥巴在她的黑毛上结成块状，使她与高阳隔绝。她的大圆耳朵抽动着，关注着从洞穴里传来的微弱抓挠声。她的猎物已经醒了。莫伊拉拉开她的弓，无声无息地巧妙地搭上一支箭。她等待着。很快，这只强大的猫头鹰蹒跚着走出了山洞。一个干燥的夏天迫使它更接近文明，它开始捕食贸易大篷车。莫伊拉瞄准了目标，放出了她的箭。带刺的小路将再次安全行驶。",

Some Mousefolk study a trade skill to support their families, while others use their natural agility and intellect for contract services.": "老鼠族的生活是贴近地面的生活。由于没有大的帝国或王国可以称之为家，鼠人的生活是在大的种族的城市中或在未被驯服的荒野中为自己开辟一个地方。他们形成了紧密的社区，每个成员都被期望为整个社区的成功做出贡献。一些鼠人学习贸易技能以支持他们的家庭，而另一些则利用他们天生的敏捷性和智力提供合同服务。",
	"Reaching a little over 2 feet tall, the Mousefolk often go unnoticed in their day to day activities.
