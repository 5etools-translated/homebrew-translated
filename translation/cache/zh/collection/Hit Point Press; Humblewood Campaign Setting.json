	"The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behaviour stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.": "刺猬是所有卑微的人中最有外交手腕和天性的，它们喜欢在整个森林的村庄里过着安静的生活，或者在鸟人的安全栖息地里。它们类似于刺猬，尽管覆盖在它们背上的毛刺要坚硬得多，坚硬得足以击退刀片，锋利得足以刺穿怪物的坚固皮毛。尽管它们很结实，但刺猬是敏感而情绪化的生物，它们表现出的温顺多于虚张声势。他们在社交场合的温顺举止和恭敬态度为他们赢得了在外人眼中是懦夫的声誉。但他们的行为并不是出于胆怯，而是源于尊重他人的感受和敏感度的愿望，这在绿篱社会中被认为是最重要的。",
	"Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.": "赫德人有一种难以置信的同情能力，并倾向于将所有的生物，从最小的甲虫到最大的野兽，都视为同样值得尊重和尊严。他们因是优秀的冲突调解员而闻名于整个森林，通常发现自己在各派别之间充当外交官或使者，试图促成一项协议。",
	"Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.": "当每个人都相处融洽时，赫德人感到最自在。他们是少数几个真正理解冲突不是邪恶力量的种族之一，而只是代表一种必须解决的不平衡现象。这并不是说绿篱从未经历过纷争，只是说他们积极主动的调解方式，加上他们对所有生物的尊严的深深尊重，导致冲突的场合较少。然而，当严重的冲突出现时，感觉自己受到真正的、深刻的伤害的绿篱会把自己与社会的其他部分隔离开来，有时会导致社区的分裂。",
	"One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.": "绿篱对他人表现出如此深刻的同情和怜悯的原因之一，是由于它们感受到的情绪的强度。这些情感的强度既适用于积极的情感，也适用于消极的情感，这意味着绿篱的情感创伤很深。",
	"Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus.

It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.": "绿篱被赋予了与大韵律的独特联系，它与自然界的联系类似于一些胆小鬼所拥有的联系。这赋予了绿篱特殊的魔法天赋，如与森林中最小的地栖生物对话的能力，以及使花朵绽放的能力。对绿篱来说，拥有各种动物朋友分享他们的家园是很常见的。",
	"Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.": "住在鸟人城市之外的绿篱喜欢住在大树根下的独立洞穴里。绿篱社区喜欢生活在大自然中，靠近森林中的空地或孤独的小树林。中央会议区和公共花园可以建在洞穴之间的空间。绿篱喜欢园艺，并倾向于在它们居住的地方保留一些小花园。",
	"Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge's clothing.": "灌木在穿衣服时需要特别考虑，喜欢宽松的长衫、宽松的裤子、飘逸的长袍和其他容易盖住它们的毛刺的衣服。当不主动伸出羽毛时，这些坚韧的羽毛会自然变平，变得触感光滑。然而，如果突然受到惊吓，它们的羽毛会反射性地张开并变硬，这种意外会毁掉绿篱的衣服。",
	"Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge's needs.": "专门为树篱制作的冒险服几乎在汉伯伍德的每个主要城市都能买到，整个伍德的裁缝都熟悉如何进行修改以适应树篱的需要。",

Jerbeens have a strong sense of family and like to surround themselves with good company wherever they rest.": "杰比恩是一种类似老鼠的小动物，有长长的、毛茸茸的尾巴，可以帮助它们保持平衡。与它们身体的其他部分相比，杰比恩的腿长而有力。杰比恩可以在整个森林的各种地方找到，通常在鸟人的栖息地和卑微的村庄里形成自己的社区。他们很少单独居住。一个Jerbeen的家可以包含几代人，包括大家庭和堂兄弟姐妹一起生活在一个屋檐下。杰比恩人有强烈的家庭意识，并且喜欢在他们休息的地方与好伙伴在一起。",
	"Jerbeens are the smallest inhabitants of Humblewood, dwarfed by nearly every kind of creature they encounter. While they are quick and nimble, and possess an affable attitude, they are not very strong, brave, or powerful on their own. When they stand with a group, jerbeens are emboldened: the presence of others reassures them, granting them the courage to face even the largest threats head on. They excel in team strategies, helping one another solve problems that could not be surmounted alone.": "Jerbeens是Humblewood最小的居民，几乎被他们遇到的每一种生物都弄得矮小。虽然他们行动敏捷，态度和蔼，但他们自己并不强壮、勇敢或强大。当他们和一群人站在一起时，Jerbeens就会胆大起来：其他人的存在让他们感到安心，给予他们勇气去面对甚至是最大的威胁。他们擅长团队策略，互相帮助，解决那些无法单独克服的问题。",
	"The communal slant of jerbeens stems from more than just their love of good company: jerbeen are kind and considerate creatures, known for their joviality and charm. Being small and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst possible fate a jerbeen could suffer.": "Jerbeens的公共倾向不仅仅源于他们对好伙伴的热爱：Jerbeen是一种善良和体贴的生物，以其欢快和魅力而闻名。身材矮小且不是特别强壮给了他们一个视角，使他们能够轻松地同情他人，尽管不是所有的杰比恩都有这种同情心。有些人对他们社区外的危险作出反应，变得孤僻，害怕所有非杰尔宾人。杰比恩人重视隐私，但与朋友、家人或亲人的真正隔离被认为是杰比恩人可能遭受的最糟糕的命运。",
	"Mapachs mature quickly, reaching adulthood around 8 years. Despite this they have fairly average lifespans, the oldest among them living just past 60 years.": "马帕奇人成熟得很快，在8年左右达到成年。尽管如此，他们的寿命相当平均，其中最年长的人刚过60岁。",
	"Mapachs don't favour good over evil, with most choosing to remain neutral. They also lean towards the freedom of chaotic alignments.": "马帕奇人并不偏向于正邪，大多数人选择保持中立。他们也倾向于自由的混沌结盟。",
	"Mapachs stand between 4 and 5 feet tall, and encompass a variety of builds from svelt to wide, weighing between 90 and 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "马帕奇人的身高在4至5英尺之间，身材从瘦小到宽大都有，体重在90至160磅之间。你的尺寸是中等。",
	"You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Mapachs are most comfortable under the cloak of night.": "你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线下看东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中看东西就像昏暗的光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。马帕奇人在夜幕的笼罩下最为舒适。",
	"You have a climb speed of 20 feet.": "你的爬升速度为20英尺。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.": "你对毒药的救赎有优势，对毒药伤害有抵抗力。",
	"You are proficient with {@item tinker's tools}. Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but functional versions of common items using materials present in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30 gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart.": "你精通（%0%）。此外，你有能力利用你周围的材料建造粗糙但实用的普通物品。你可以花10分钟将这些材料制作成任何价值30金币或以下的工具或冒险装备。该物品将是完全实用的，甚至能够作为一种伪装（如果你制作的是一件衣服）。工具，以及任何其他在第一次使用时就会破损的物品（卡尔特罗，箭），在之后都会变得无用。否则，手工制作的物品将持续1个小时才会散架。",
	"Depending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.": "根据现有的材料，游戏管理员（GM）可能会规定你不能以这种方式制作物品。例如，如果你碰巧在酸性甲虫幼虫的巢穴附近，酸液瓶可能很容易制作，或者树皮可以被捆绑成一个临时的烧瓶，但是用一堆树叶制作一个合格的丝质长袍的模型就很难了。",
	"Should you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance. You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand. Though, how long your repairs hold together is up to the GM.": "如果你能得到适当的材料，你可以花8个小时将你用这种方式搜刮来的物品转化为永久版本，只要你在物品散架之前开始这个过程。以这种方式制作的物品将与正常版本的物品完全一样，如果你熟练掌握了制作工具，它们甚至可以看起来像专业制作的。否则，它们会保留一个相当粗糙的、拼凑起来的外观。你也可以用 \"拾荒 \"的方式来修复损坏的设备，只要你手头有材料。不过，你的修理能维持多久，要看GM的意思。",
	"You have advantage on {@skill Stealth} checks made in dim light and darkness.": "你在昏暗的光线和黑暗中进行的检查有优势（%0%）。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Mapach.": "你可以说、读、写Birdfolk和Mapach。",

	"Naturally curious, mapachs are a medium-sized racoon-like race. They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn't diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric.": "天生好奇的马帕奇是一个中型的浣熊类种族。他们狡猾、健壮、坚韧，但他们真正的力量在于他们在观察周围世界时看到的潜力。马帕奇人的手非常轻巧，精细的运动控制能力也很强，不会随着年龄的增长而减弱。他们还善于攀爬和潜行。这一点，再加上他们对小饰品的喜爱，为他们赢得了一个当之无愧的小偷声誉。虽然也有例外，但大多数马帕奇人都是相当善良的，即使有点怪癖。",
	"Mapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions, and at intuiting the right course of action when faced with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportunities rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them. Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings. Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by obvious traps.": "马帕奇善于在艰难的林地条件下生存，并且在面临问题时能凭直觉采取正确的行动方案。它们也是不折不扣的机会主义者。有些人可能会认为他们很粗鲁，但Mapachs知道机会很少出现，并会迅速采取行动。马帕奇人很警觉，对周围环境有敏锐的认识。只有他们中真正愚蠢的人才会被明显的陷阱所迷惑。",
	"One of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as \"scroungecraft\", and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.": "地图客最出名的特征之一是他们能够为任何东西找到用途。这种从碎片、垃圾或手头材料中创造出功能性或有用物品的诀窍被称为 \"拾荒术\"，是mapachs中的一种文化支柱。这种活动被认为是一种艺术形式，与其他民族的高级艺术相提并论。拾荒展示了创造力、聪明才智和足智多谋，但却被外人误解，认为是原始或粗糙的行为。由地图绘制者创造的天才想法往往是从拾荒者的原型开始的。许多建造了这种有趣或独特作品的人在马帕奇人中取得了名人地位，并在松散组织的scroungecraft展览会上展示他们的技能。",
	"Mapachs are often loners, but when they do establish communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart's pulley system was based. The pulley system was so successful that birdfolk perches beyond Alderheart have adopted the technology.": "马帕奇人常常是独来独往，但当他们与卑微的人或鸟人建立社区时，他们有一个习惯，就是无论走到哪里都会促进创新。马帕奇人的聪明才智是Alderheart的滑轮系统所依据的装置。这个滑轮系统非常成功，以至于阿尔德心以外的鸟人栖息地都采用了这项技术。",
	"Vulpins mature at an average pace, and can be comparatively long-lived. They reach adulthood at 15 years, and live well past 90 years.": "黄鼠狼以平均速度成熟，而且可以比较长寿。它们在15岁时达到成年，并能活到90岁以上。",
	"Vulpins aren't innately evil, but their difficulty empathizing with others means they are only rarely good aligned. Most vulpins find strict authority distasteful, preferring chaotic alignments over lawful ones.": "秃鹰人并非天生邪恶，但他们很难与他人产生共鸣，这就意味着他们很少会向善。大多数秃鹰人认为严格的权威令人厌恶，他们更喜欢混乱的结盟而不是合法的结盟。",

	"Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn't entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.": "秃鹰的外形像狐狸，身材轻盈，獠牙锋利。秃鹰是森林中最不被理解和最常被诋毁的卑鄙小人之一，它赢得了一个并不完全应得的坏名声。这在很大程度上是由于秃鹰的雄心勃勃的事实。有时，他们成功的动力会使他们难以与他人产生共鸣。秃鹰和其他木族人一样有深刻的感受，但他们拥有敏锐的生存本能，有时会导致他们采取自私的行动。此外，他们敏锐而精明，拥有一种不可思议的人格力量，使他们能够轻易地动摇他人的信任。在正确的情况下，秃鹰可以成为真正的朋友，而在错误的情况下则是致命的敌人。",
	"Vulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others.": "秃鹰是天生的聪明人，只有科威姆能与之匹敌。然而，在科沃姆人好学的地方，秃鹰更有创造力。他们喜欢艺术和对休闲的追求。有些人一生都在掌握一种艺术形式；学习雕塑、诗歌或精致的剑术。尽管秃鹰来自各行各业，但他们也有势利眼和看不起别人的名声。",
	"All vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence.": "所有的秃鹰都与木之魔法有着天然的联系，尽管他们以特殊的方式引导它。秃鹰的正确眼神可以迷惑人，也可以让人害怕，而真正熟练的秃鹰可以通过纯粹的力量指挥整个房间。",
	"Before the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike.

There is nothing a gallus would not give to their neighbors in a time of need.": "高卢雄鸡是一种社会性和公共性的民俗。无论他们在哪里栖息，都倾向于形成紧密的社区，他们对自己社区的自豪感很深。当悲剧使他们村里的孩子成为孤儿时，按照惯例，Gallus家庭会收留他们。胆小鬼重视诚实的工作，如耕作和铁匠，并在所有社区成员之间平等分享劳动。在需要的时候，没有什么是加洛人不愿意给他们的邻居的。",
	"While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point of being socially exploitable. The gallus have an ear for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies and dishonesty.": "虽然其他鸟人可能会因为他们的普通方式而看不起gallus，但gallus有出色的人际交往能力。他们很有洞察力和同情心，但不至于在社会上被利用。胆小鬼有一双听真话的耳朵，而且常常能够根除谎言和不诚实的行为。",

	"Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colours, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.": "在谈到他们在鲈鱼社会中的作用时，卢马人是一个极端对立的种族。他们经常因为自己的怪癖而被回避，也因为这些怪癖而被赞美。卢马人比大多数鸟人要小，像鸽子或鸽子。许多人的羽毛围脖闪耀着独特的彩虹色，这可以被视为诱人或不寻常的东西。大多数初出茅庐的鲁玛人在接近社交场合时都会犹豫不决，直到有一天社会不可避免地给他们贴上弃儿或知名人士的标签时，个人就会自然地适应这个角色。",
	"To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.": "对大多数人来说，鲁玛人似乎永远都是杂乱无章、心不在焉的，这导致人们认为他们的智力很低。事实上，鲁玛人对世界有独特的感知。他们能够以一种不寻常的方式解释信息，使他们能够看到其他人无法看到的可能性。",

Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.": "这些与生俱来的天赋，有时被认为是运气，可以通过训练和学习来提高。将他们的天赋与魔法教育结合起来，强大的卢马巫师和激进的学者们在汉伯伍德的一段时间内一直处于魔法创新的前沿。",
	"While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.": "虽然大多数鲁玛人发现他们的奇特天性在社会上是一种障碍，但有些人利用他们的天赋来攀登社会阶梯。这些人激发了人们的好奇心，在他们身上有一种权威的气息。鲁玛人之间的这种社会地位的分化会使家庭和朋友之间的关系变得好奇和紧张。",
	"Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.": "其他鲁玛人发现在鸟人城市的大社会中很难生存。据说这也是大型城市中卢马人紧密团结、独占鳌头的一个主要因素。卢马人倾向于独来独往，更喜欢和那些理解他们的人在一起，而不是那些评头论足的人。",

These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.": "当鸟人想到猎人或护林员时，他们会想到猛禽。他们类似于小鹰、老鹰和其他猛禽，拥有锋利的爪子和敏捷的身材，帮助他们毫不费力地在树冠上滑行。这些鸟人敏捷而强壮，有一种不可思议的追踪技巧。它们很少成为猎物，当发现自己被猎杀时，它们会迅速扭转局面。",
	"Given their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have an extremely wide field of awareness.": "鉴于其高度的感官，猛禽往往看起来心不在焉或陷入深思。实际上，它们正在处理从它们特别敏锐的眼睛和敏感的耳朵中得到的大量感官信息。虽然许多人只知道他们周围发生的事情，但猛禽有一个非常广泛的意识领域。",
	"Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for their perches. Raptors are especially well versed in stalking prey from great heights, lining up impossible shots that their prey could not predict.": "猛禽善于在土地上生活。它们是熟练的猎手，通常领导收获肉和皮的栖息地。猛禽尤其擅长从高处跟踪猎物，排成不可能的镜头，让猎物无法预测。",
	"While many of the birdfolk races are culturally communal, raptors don't have a great sense of connectedness, nor do they tend to create their own perches. They are more likely to adopt a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply live in the vast forests of the Wood itself.": "虽然许多鸟人种族在文化上是共有的，但猛禽并没有很大的联系感，它们也不倾向于创造自己的栖息地。它们更有可能采取一种短暂的生活方式，从一个栖息地搬到另一个栖息地，或者干脆生活在森林本身的广阔森林中。",
	"Though typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature, raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even familial ties.": "虽然通常很安静，但猛禽并不排斥与其他鸟类朋友建立关系。尽管它们的天性很矜持，但猛禽对个人关系的重视程度比社会关系甚至家庭关系都要高。",

	"Cervans are a versatile deer-like folk who make their homes in small, intimate villages throughout Humblewood.

	"Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to positions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.": "塞万人拥有强健的体魄，很少生病。他们是卑微的人类中最长寿的种族之一。虽然他们的警惕性为他们赢得了胆小的名声，但塞万人之所以谨慎，是因为他们保持着活跃和警觉，而且通常喜欢实践而不是沉思。塞万人喜欢独立追求技能，以便给自己一种目标感。这种努力是推动一些塞尔凡人在整个森林中担任重要职务的原因。一个快乐的塞万人是一个努力工作的人。",
	"One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.": "塞万人形成如此紧密的社区的原因之一是对外来者的不信任。在《条约》签订之前，Vulpin突袭者和Mapach盗贼是严重的威胁。这些时代早已过去，但塞万人仍然拥有一种戒心，使其他人很难获得他们的信任。在《谦卑人条约》实施后，许多塞万人继续按照旧的方式生活。然而，一些塞万人的村庄从此开始包含零星的jerbeen家庭，或一些孤独的树篱。即使在这种情况下，塞万人仍然保持着领导地位，并委以重任，确保村庄按照塞万人的古老教义进行管理，确保完成最偏远村庄生存所需的工作，使其所有居民保持健康和快乐。",
	"The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans' greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one's options. The best cervan leaders favour this approach.": "平衡他们与生俱来的谨慎和实际考虑的能力是塞万斯人最大的优势之一。塞万人教导说，在任何情况下，最好的生存手段是保持冷静并权衡自己的选择。最好的塞万族领导人赞成这种方法。",
	"Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as \"The Sight\", this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as \"The Sighted\", and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.": "塞万人有一种独特的能力，可以反弹并在可能杀死其他人的身体冲击中幸存下来。偶尔，在这种创伤中幸存下来的塞万斯人被赋予神秘的幻觉。有时，这些是对他们周围世界的洞察力的闪光，有时是厄运的预兆，有时是对遥远未来的憧憬。这种现象在塞万人中被称为 \"视力\"，难以捉摸，而且不受凡人控制。以这种方式看到异象的塞万斯人被称为 \"视力\"，在这个最初的事件之后，有些人会突然发现自己能接受过去、现在和未来的异象。",
	"A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren't always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.": "被激发了洞察力的塞万被鼓励去磨练它，这样他们就有可能在他们的村子里担任预言家的角色。然而，这些努力并不总是成功的。洞察力有时会在雪人的一生中只出现一次，无论如何训练都无法再次瞥见这种幻觉。这被认为是最好的结果，因为塞万承认，那些真正有视力的人携带的知识既是一种祝福也是一种诅咒。",

	"When you cast this spell you may designate any number of creatures you can see to be concealed by the supernatural shadows while in the sphere. A concealed creature has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks when inside the sphere and may attempt to hide at any time. Because the area of the spell is lightly obscured, creatures within the spell's area have disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to see those outside of it.": "当你施展这个法术时，你可以指定任何数量的你能看到的生物在球体中被超自然的阴影所掩盖。被隐藏的生物在球体内时，在灵巧（（%0%））检查上有优势，并且可以在任何时候尝试隐藏。由于该法术的区域被轻度遮蔽，在该法术区域内的生物在智慧（{@skill Perception}）的检查上有劣势，无法看到其外的生物。",
	"All other creatures in the area are dazzled by the light of the miniature stars, causing them to have disadvantage on all perception checks inside the sphere. When such a creature enters the spell's area for the first time, or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its turn.": "该区域内的所有其他生物都会被微型恒星的光芒所眩晕，导致它们在球体内的所有感知检查中处于劣势。当这样的生物第一次进入法术区域，或者在那里开始它的回合，它必须做一个智慧救赎动作，否则会被（%0%），直到它的回合结束。",
	"You spread your arms wide, allowing yourself to become enveloped by the air around you. Until the end of your next turn, any ranged attack against you is made with disadvantage.": "你张开双臂，让自己被你周围的空气所笼罩。直到你的下一个回合结束，任何针对你的远程攻击都是以劣势进行的。",
	"Melee attackers who successfully hit you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker is flung away from you up to 10 feet and is knocked {@condition prone}.": "成功击中你的近战攻击者必须对你的法术救赎DC做一个宪法救赎。如果失败，攻击者会被甩出10英尺远，并被击倒（%0%）。",
	"You call upon the power of an Amaranthine to grant yourself insight into the Great Rhythm that moves all things. When you cast this spell, roll two {@dice d20}s, and record what you rolled. For each die, choose either attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. You can choose each option multiple times. For the next 24 hours, you may substitute any roll of an ally or enemy you can see within 60 feet with one of the recorded numbers that matches the type of roll you wish to replace (attack roll, skill check, or saving throw). The target still adds any relevant modifiers to this number, but otherwise treat the substituted number as the number they rolled.": "你召唤苋菜的力量，使你能洞察到推动万物的大节奏。当你施展这个法术时，掷出两个{@dice d20}的骰子，并记录你掷出的结果。对于每个骰子，你可以选择攻击卷、技能检查或救赎。你可以多次选择每个选项。在接下来的24小时内，你可以用所记录的数字中的一个来替代60英尺内你能看到的盟友或敌人的任何掷骰子，而这个数字要与你想替代的掷骰子类型相匹配（攻击掷骰子、技能检查、或救赎）。目标仍然会在这个数字上加上任何相关的修饰，但除此之外，将被替换的数字视为他们掷出的数字。",
	"To do this, you must spend a reaction to present your holy symbol and invoke the name of the Amaranthine whose energies you called upon. You can do this anytime after the skill check, saving throw or attack has been rolled, but before the outcome of the event has been determined. The spell ends after 24 hours have passed, or when both dice have been expended.": "要做到这一点，你必须花费一个反应来展示你的神圣符号，并呼唤你所召唤的能量的阿玛兰蒂恩的名字。你可以在技能检查、蓄力或攻击被掷出后，但在事件的结果被确定之前，随时做这个动作。咒语在24小时后结束，或在两个骰子都用完后结束。",
	"You call upon gentle natural magics to alter the growth of plants. Any plant life you can see within range that fits within a 5-foot cube can take on whatever shape you desire. Additionally, if the plant is a bramble or capable of growing thorns, you may turn the affected area into difficult terrain, causing {@dice 2d4} points of piercing damage for every 5 feet moved through the area you shaped. You may also increase or decrease the number of flowers, vines, leaves, thorns, branches, or fruits produced by any plant you shape.": "你召唤温和的自然魔法来改变植物的生长。你在范围内看到的任何符合5英尺立方体的植物生命都可以变成你想要的形状。此外，如果植物是荆棘或能长出荆棘，你可以将受影响的区域变成困难的地形，在你塑造的区域内每移动5英尺就会造成（%0%）点刺伤。你也可以增加或减少你塑造的任何植物所产生的花、藤、叶、刺、枝或果实的数量。",
	"After one hour, the magic of your spell fades, and the plant resumes its normal shape. If you can use speak with plants (or a similar ability) to communicate with the plant, you may persuade it to retain its new form. Different plants have different feelings and attitudes, and if the form is too different from its natural shape it is likely to decline. If the plant accepts, at the GM's discretion, it will retain the form you have sculpted it into, in which case the effect becomes permanent.": "一小时后，你的咒语的魔力就会消失，植物就会恢复正常形状。如果你能使用与植物对话（或类似的能力）与植物沟通，你可以说服它保留新的形态。不同的植物有不同的感觉和态度，如果形态与它的自然形态差别太大，它很可能会拒绝。如果植物接受，由GM决定，它将保留你所雕刻的形态，在这种情况下，效果将成为永久性的。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 4th level, the size of the cube of plant life you can affect with the spell increases by an additional 5 feet for every slot level above 4th.": "当你使用4级以上的法术槽施展此法术时，你能用此法术影响的植物生命立方体的大小，每超过4级的法术槽等级就会额外增加5英尺。",
	"An ethereal barrier of spikes, made of magical force, interposes itself between you and an attacker. Until your next turn, when you are hit by a melee attack, the barrier reduces the damage your are dealt by {@dice 2d4}, and deals the same amount of piercing damage to the attacker. The shield is ineffective against ranged attackers, but still provides a +2 bonus to AC (treat as half cover) against them for the duration.": "一个由魔法力量构成的空灵的尖刺屏障，插在你和攻击者之间。直到你的下一个回合，当你被近战攻击击中时，该屏障会减少你受到的伤害（%0%），并对攻击者造成相同数量的穿刺伤害。盾牌对远程攻击者无效，但在持续时间内仍能对他们提供+2的攻击力加成（视作一半的掩护）。",

	"You create two small stars that orbit you. They twinkle pleasantly, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius centered on you. The stars protect you. If a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack they must make a Wisdom saving throw or take {@dice 1d8} points of radiant damage for each star orbiting you.": "你创造了两颗围绕你的小星星。它们愉快地闪烁着，在以你为中心的10英尺范围内发出昏暗的光。这些星星保护你。如果一个在你5英尺范围内的生物用近身攻击击中你，他们必须做一个智慧救赎动作，否则在你周围的每颗星星都会受到{@dice 1d8}点辐射伤害。",
	"Once per round, on your turn, you may use your action to cause a star to streak towards an enemy, expending it as it explodes in a blinding flash. Make a ranged spell attack against an enemy within 120 feet, dealing {@damage 4d8} points of radiant damage on a hit. The target must then make a Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the start of your next turn.": "每回合一次，在你的回合中，你可以用你的行动使一颗星向敌人飞去，当它在刺眼的闪光中爆炸时消耗它。对120英尺范围内的敌人进行远程法术攻击，击中后造成{@damage 4d8}点辐射伤害。然后，目标必须进行宪法救赎，否则就会受到{@condition blinded}的伤害，直到你下一个回合开始。",
	"The spell ends when either its duration expires, you fall {@condition unconscious}, or you have expended all of your stars.": "当咒语的持续时间结束，你倒下（%0%），或者你耗尽了你所有的星星，咒语就会结束。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 4th level, you may create one additional star for every two slot levels above 4th. For each additional star orbiting you, the radius of dim light centered on you increases by 5 feet.": "当你使用四级以上的法术槽施展这个法术时，你可以为四级以上的每两个法术槽等级创造一个额外的星星。每增加一颗围绕你的星星，以你为中心的昏暗光线的半径就增加5英尺。",

	"Ardea is depicted as a great stork with shining golden feathers, wreathed in flowers or other plant life. She is the Amaranthine of the sun who watches over the flora and fauna of Everden and provides them with light and energy to grow.": "阿狄亚被描绘成一只巨大的鹳，有着闪亮的金色羽毛，身上缠绕着鲜花或其他植物。她是太阳的Amaranthine，守护着埃弗顿的动植物，为它们的生长提供光和能量。",
	"Ardea's light is present in all living things, from the tiniest sprouting seed to the mightiest beast. Her light also represents love and kindness, which every creature is believed to possess. All birdfolk are said to be Ardea's children, and many think she appears as a stork to demonstrate her maternal love for them—although she is speculated to appear in a different form to each woodland race.": "阿迪尔的光存在于所有生物中，从最微小的萌芽种子到最强大的野兽。她的光也代表着爱和仁慈，每个生物都被认为拥有这些。所有的鸟人据说都是阿迪亚的孩子，许多人认为她以鹳鸟的形象出现，以显示她对他们的母爱--尽管据推测，她以不同的形式出现在每个林地种族。",
	"When she vacates the sky she rests in a plane of pure light and life. There, great celestial storks carry out her will, and act as her messengers in the mortal world. An old folk story relates that Ardea sends these storks to fly unnoticed into Everden, where they place her animating light into unhatched eggs. This is why birdfolk often refer to her as \"Mother Stork\".": "当她离开天空时，她在一个纯粹的光和生命的平面上休息。在那里，伟大的天体鹳鸟执行她的意志，并作为她在凡人世界的信使。一个古老的民间故事说，阿迪雅派这些鹳鸟神不知鬼不觉地飞到埃弗登，在那里它们把她的灵光放入未孵化的蛋中。这就是为什么鸟人经常称她为 \"鹳妈妈\"。",
	"She is worshiped by good aligned characters of every sort: poets write of the love she has bestowed upon the world, priests ask her to watch over the newly born, and farmers pray to her for good harvests and light winters.": "她被各种善良的结盟人物所崇拜：诗人写下了她赐予世界的爱，牧师要求她看护新生儿，农民向她祈求丰收和轻盈的冬天。",
	"Tyton is depicted as an immense black barn owl. It is believed he ushers the night in by spreading his wings over the sky. Tyton also governs time, memory, and death. As the sun must set, so too must the light of life give way to the darkness of the grave. Rather than being seen as a frightful figure, Tyton is looked upon as kind; he greets the old, the frail, and those at the end of their lives as familiar friends, guiding their souls peacefully back into the Great Rhythm, where they will be reborn, in time.": "泰顿被描绘成一只巨大的黑色仓鸮。人们相信他通过在天空中张开翅膀来迎接夜晚的到来。泰顿还掌管着时间、记忆和死亡。由于太阳必须落下，生命之光也必须让位于坟墓的黑暗。泰坦没有被看作是一个可怕的人物，而是被看作是一个善良的人；他像熟悉的朋友一样迎接年老、虚弱和生命尽头的人，引导他们的灵魂平静地回到大节奏中，在那里他们将获得重生，在时间上。",
	"When not occupying the sky, it is believed Tyton resides in the lands of death. Not an afterlife, rather this is a part of the Great Rhythm where everything is cold, dark, and eternally still. His abode lies beyond the parts of the Rhythm associated with life, a divide impossible for mortals to cross. Even other Amaranthine find travel to the lands of death difficult, except for Altus, who resides there with Tyton for most of the year, only leaving to bring winter storms across the land.": "在不占据天空的时候，人们相信泰坦居住在死亡之地。这不是一个来世，而是大节奏的一部分，在那里一切都很冷，很黑暗，而且永远静止。他的住处位于节奏中与生命有关的部分之外，是一个凡人无法跨越的鸿沟。即使是其他亚马逊人也发现前往死亡之地很困难，除了阿尔图斯，他一年中的大部分时间都和泰坦一起居住在那里，只有在冬季暴风雨来临的时候才会离开。",
	"In addition to guiding the souls of the dead, Tyton is associated with the coming of old age, and the keeping of memory. When Tyton is invoked at funerals, it is to remember those who have passed, and to recall their lives and deeds. He watches the living, patiently observing all beneath him. Tyton can learn all there is to know of your life by watching your dreams. Because Tyton watches the living from birth to death, he is known as \"Father Owl\".": "除了引导死者的灵魂，Tyton还与老年的到来和记忆的保持有关。当泰坦在葬礼上被召唤时，是为了纪念那些已经去世的人，并回忆他们的生活和事迹。他注视着活人，耐心地观察着他身下的一切。泰顿可以通过观察你的梦境来了解你生活中的一切。因为泰坦从出生到死亡都在观察生者，他被称为 \"猫头鹰之父\"。",
	"Tyton frowns upon those who would seek to enslave the souls of the dead using necromantic magics, and those who would desecrate the tombs of the deceased, as these actions corrupt the natural cycle.": "泰顿对那些试图用亡灵魔法奴役死者灵魂的人，以及那些亵渎死者坟墓的人不屑一顾，因为这些行为会破坏自然循环。",
	"Altus is depicted as a powerful horned owl with white feathers, who rides across the sky pouring thunderheads from his chalice. Altus is a pragmatic Amaranthine, believing that strength is cultivated through enduring hardships, overcoming challenges, and testing mortal limitations. Stories of Altus' tenacity and endurance abound, including the time he captured the moon as a gift to Ardea, and the time he made the mountains by lifting the earth. Themes of bravery and strength are common in his myths.": "阿尔图斯被描绘成一只长着白色羽毛的强大角鸮，他骑在天空中，从他的圣杯中倾泻出雷电。阿尔图斯是一个务实的亚马逊人，认为力量是通过忍受困难、克服挑战和测试凡人的限制来培养的。关于阿尔图斯的坚韧和耐力的故事比比皆是，包括他抓住月亮作为礼物送给阿迪亚，以及他通过抬起地球来创造山脉的时间。勇敢和力量的主题在他的神话中很常见。",
	"Altus resides with Tyton in the lands of death. Legend says that every year Altus makes the long and arduous journey to bring winter storms and foul weather. According to myth, this is as much to test the endurance of his people as it is to test himself by crossing the divide between life and death, which binds the Great Rhythm. Summers with especially bad weather are credited to Altus, who made the trip early to keep his people strong and vigilant.": "阿尔图斯与泰顿一起居住在死亡之境中。传说中，阿尔图斯每年都会进行漫长而艰辛的旅行，带来冬季的风暴和恶劣的天气。根据神话，这既是为了测试他的人民的耐力，也是为了通过跨越生与死之间的分界线来测试他自己，而这一分界线将大律动捆绑在一起。气候特别恶劣的夏天归功于阿尔图斯，他早早地进行了旅行，以保持他的人民的强大和警惕性。",
	"Altus is the patron Amaranthine of the strig, and is celebrated by them annually in a great winter festival. Games and activities during this festival challenge entrants with feats of strength and endurance. No official winner is declared, and all who participate are lauded for their courage and given a special place at the feasting table.": "阿尔图斯是斯特里格人的守护神，他们每年都会在一个伟大的冬季节日中庆祝。在这个节日里，各种游戏和活动都是对参赛者力量和耐力的挑战。没有宣布正式的赢家，所有参与的人都因其勇气而受到赞扬，并在宴会上获得一个特殊的位置。",
	"Altus usually finds veneration among warriors or athletes, but also among common people who pray for strength to withstand personal hardships, bad harvests, and natural disasters.": "阿尔图斯通常在战士或运动员中得到崇敬，但也在普通人中得到崇敬，他们祈祷有力量抵御个人困难、歉收和自然灾害。",
	"Fickle and unpredictable, Clhuran is the Amaranthine of fortune, magic, and fate. He is commonly represented in dual profile: on one side as a jester with bangles and bells, carrying a marotte, and on the other as an executioner, weilding an axe. Clhuran's double profile illustrates his fickle nature, and the nature of fate. Clhuran's tales are of his luck, mirth, and jest, though he is also known to be a capricious Amaranthine. His normally pleasant demeanor can shift at a moment's notice to melancholy or jealousy.": "克赫兰是幸运、魔法和命运的代表，善变且不可预测。他通常以双重形象出现：一边是戴着手镯和铃铛、拿着马洛特的小丑，另一边是拿着斧头的刽子手。克赫兰的双重形象说明了他善变的本性，以及命运的本质。克赫兰的故事是关于他的运气、欢笑和玩笑的，尽管他也被称为是一个任性的阿马兰斯人。他通常愉快的举止可以在一瞬间转变为忧郁或嫉妒。",
	"Clhuran teaches that everyone is tied to the web of fate by invisible strands. Each thread extends out into the cosmos, darting and weaving as it moves to the Rhythm. Clhuran's wisdom is to allow yourself to be moved by the threads of fate, to feel the pull of possibility around you, and to act in accordance with their whims. Even misfortune may lead one to an important place, or so Clhuran says. Good times and bad times are all part of the tapestry of fate, and there is a strength that can be drawn from accepting one's destiny. According to his teachings, good luck is nothing more than being open to change, and following the will of the universe.": "克赫兰教导说，每个人都被无形的线束缚在命运之网上。每条线都延伸到宇宙中，随着节奏的变化而跳动和编织。克赫兰的智慧是让自己被命运之线所感动，感受周围可能性的牵引，并按照它们的想法行事。即使是不幸，也可能将一个人带到一个重要的地方，或者说克赫兰是这么说的。好时光和坏时光都是命运织锦的一部分，有一种力量可以从接受一个人的命运中汲取。根据他的教义，好运不过是对变化持开放态度，并遵循宇宙的意志。",
	"Lumas are seen to be Clhuran's chosen, because of their connection to the threads of fate, which manifests as a natural magical talent. Arcane spellcasters, seers, and fortune tellers pray to Clhuran for insight into the will of the universe. Bards, artists, and writers also pay homage to Clhuran, because of his wild moods and connection to emotion. They hope to follow their fate to events of great import, which may be immortalized by their art.": "卢马人被认为是克赫兰选中的人，因为他们与命运之线有联系，这表现为一种自然的魔法天赋。奥术师、预言家和算命先生向克莱胡兰祈祷，希望能洞察宇宙的意志。吟游诗人、艺术家和作家也向克赫兰致敬，因为他有狂野的情绪和与情感的联系。他们希望能跟随自己的命运进入具有重大意义的事件，这些事件可能会被他们的艺术所永存。",

She acknowledges that delving into the unknown requires the courage to be burned.": "Gesme是一个神秘的人物，她是掌管知识、洞察力和灵感的Amaranthine。她代表火，是激发和毁灭的火花。她承认，对未知事物的探索需要有被燃烧的勇气。",
	"Gesme is depicted as a raven, whose body is alight with the flames of knowledge. In her talons she carries a staff of burning oak which lights the way for scholars. Gesme is best known for stealing fire from Ardea's sun and bringing it to Everden, burning her feathers black in the process.": "Gesme被描绘成一只乌鸦，其身体被知识的火焰点燃。她的爪子里拿着一根燃烧的橡木杖，为学者们照亮道路。格斯梅最出名的是她从阿迪亚的太阳上偷了火，并把它带到了埃弗登，在这个过程中她的羽毛被烧成黑色。",
	"Her stolen flame brought fire and the light of reason to the world. While this act earned her a place among the Amaranthine, many feel it was a folly to give fire to mortals.": "她偷来的火焰给世界带来了火和理性之光。虽然这一行为为她赢得了在亚马逊人中的地位，但许多人认为把火种给凡人是一种愚蠢的行为。",
	"She is the patron spirit of the corvums. Legend has it that all corvums have at least one black feather, symbolic of Gesme's seared plumage.": "她是科沃姆族的守护神。传说中，所有的珊瑚虫都至少有一根黑色的羽毛，象征着Gesme的血色羽翼。",
	"Gesme teaches that chaos and innovation are part of a great cycle. Each discovery spawns a new mystery, which leads to further discovery in a never-ending loop, in which the old becomes fodder for the new. She is a symbol of all that birdfolk can achieve if they dare to push boundaries and harness their creativity.": "Gesme教导我们，混乱和创新是一个大循环的一部分。每一个发现都会产生一个新的谜团，而新的谜团又会导致进一步的发现，这是一个永无止境的循环，旧的东西会成为新的东西的素材。她是一个象征，象征着鸟人如果敢于突破界限，发挥自己的创造力所能取得的一切。",
	"First among her followers are those who study the arcane arts or experiment with magical forces, such as scholars and mages. She is also revered by artisans, and craftspeople of every kind. Blacksmiths in particular understand the danger and power of working directly with flames and pay her special reverence. Her followers pray to her for the spark of creativity that will ignite the fires of creation.": "在她的追随者中，首先是那些研究奥秘艺术或试验魔法力量的人，如学者和法师。她也受到工匠和各种手艺人的敬重。铁匠们尤其了解直接与火焰打交道的危险和力量，因此对她特别崇敬。她的追随者们向她祈祷，希望能有创意的火花，点燃创造的火焰。",
	"Hanera is the birdfolk Amaranthine closest to nature. She holds dominion over all things that grow within the earth. While Ardea is the animating force of life, Hanera is the guiding heart that gives life purpose and meaning. She encourages birdfolk to see the world not only from the treetops, but from the loam and all the tiny living things beneath. Everything, Hanera teaches, is connected as part of a vast continuum of life stretching back to the earliest ancestors.": "哈内拉是最接近自然的鸟人阿玛兰蒂恩。她主宰着生长在地球上的所有事物。阿迪雅是生命的活力，而哈内拉则是赋予生命目的和意义的引导者。她鼓励鸟人不仅要从树顶上看世界，还要从泥土和下面所有微小的生物中看世界。哈内拉教导说，所有的东西都是相互联系的，是延伸到最早的祖先的巨大生命连续体的一部分。",

	"Her generosity and kindness are renowned, as is her intolerance for evil. It is Hanera's will that evil be challenged wherever it is found. Not with violence, but with acts of compassion. Those who harbor darkness in their hearts require the warmth of friends, family, and shelter to heal, and so Hanera teaches birdfolk never to give up on each other. Even the most wicked among us can be healed with love.": "她的慷慨和善良是著名的，她对邪恶的不容忍也是如此。哈内拉的意愿是，无论在哪里发现邪恶，都要对其进行挑战。不是用暴力，而是用怜悯的行为。那些心中藏有黑暗的人需要朋友、家庭和庇护所的温暖来治愈，因此哈内拉教导鸟人永远不要放弃彼此。即使是我们中最邪恶的人也可以用爱来治愈。",
	"Hanera is worshiped by farmers and druids, but many clerics tend shrines in her honor, mostly in modest woodland villages. Her holy symbol is often hung above the doorway, inside a home, to bless the dwelling and all those within.": "哈内拉受到农民和德鲁伊的崇拜，但许多神职人员也为她建造神龛，大多是在温和的林地村庄。她的神圣标志经常挂在家门口，以保佑住宅和里面的所有人。",

She is the patron of the raptors, and is believed to have endowed them with their superior senses.": "雷亚，风之女神，被描绘成一只大鹰，裹着旋转的云朵的斗篷，爪子里挥舞着一把大长弓。她是猛禽的守护神，并被认为赋予了它们超强的感官。",
	"The wind is free, streaming unimpeded across land and sea. Reya embodies this freedom. Her spirit glides through trees, over mountains, and out to the four corners of the world. She is the Amaranthine of exploration; her holy symbol forms a compass. Free-spirited folk who feel an insatiable urge to wander and roam the lands have been touched by her winds.": "风是自由的，不受阻碍地穿过陆地和海洋。雷亚体现了这种自由。她的精神穿过树木，越过山脉，向世界的四个角落滑行。她是探索的阿马兰蒂恩；她的神圣符号形成了一个指南针。自由奔放的人们感到有一种永不满足的冲动，想去流浪和漫游土地，他们被她的风所触动。",
	"Reya is a skilled hunter, credited with the invention of the bow, a gift she passed down to the birdfolk. She is also honored for her skills in navigating wild country and surviving off the land. Travelers undertaking long journeys pray to be blessed by a portion of her talents, to assist them in the perilous wilderness. Reya watches over those who embark on daring expeditions, protecting travelers and presenting them with challenges to make their journey all the more memorable.": "雷亚是一个熟练的猎人，被认为是弓的发明者，她把这一天赋传给了鸟人。她还因其在野外航行和在土地上生存的技能而受到尊敬。进行长途旅行的旅行者祈求得到她的一部分才能的祝福，以帮助他们在危险的荒野中生存。雷亚注视着那些开始大胆探险的人，保护旅行者并向他们提出挑战，使他们的旅程更加难忘。",

	"An Amaranthine of vigor and strength, Cairith is the patron spirit of the cervans. The energy that Cairith oversees is the cause of slow, steady growth and longevity. In living beings, this force manifests as the ability to run, jump, grow, and become strong. Ancient forests, where plants cover the trees and giant beasts are endowed with the intelligence to speak, are seen as signs of Cairith's blessing. Cairith teaches that adversity brings strength, but his teachings differ from those of Altus. Altus encourages his followers to seek out challenges, where Cairith sees life itself as a perpetual struggle. The true test of survival is always against oneself and one's own limits. By persevering in spite of these limits, Cairith counsels his adherents to triumph over the forces of death. This struggle must one day end, of course, and so the followers of Cairith seek to honor the daily triumphs of life as they happen. An existence is considered well-spent if it was lived unflinchingly, even in the face of sorrows and hardships. Cairith adamantly opposes necromancy as those made undead truly cannot appreciate life's struggles.": "凯里斯是充满活力和力量的苋菜，是塞万族的守护神。凯里斯所监督的能量是缓慢、稳定的增长和长寿的原因。在生物体内，这种力量表现为奔跑、跳跃、成长和变得强壮的能力。古老的森林里，植物覆盖着树木，巨大的野兽被赋予了说话的智慧，这些都被看作是凯里斯祝福的标志。凯里斯教导人们，逆境会带来力量，但他的教导与阿尔图斯的教导不同。阿尔图斯鼓励他的追随者寻求挑战，而凯里斯则认为生活本身就是一场持久的斗争。对生存的真正考验总是针对自己和自己的极限。尽管有这些限制，但通过坚持不懈的努力，凯里斯劝告他的信徒们战胜死亡的力量。当然，这场斗争总有一天会结束，因此凯里斯的追随者们寻求尊重每天发生的生命胜利。如果一个人坚定不移地活着，甚至面对悲伤和困难，那么他的存在就被认为是美好的。凯里斯坚决反对亡灵巫术，因为那些被制成亡灵的人确实无法欣赏生命的挣扎。",
	"Cairith is described as a mighty stag with antlers covered in moss and flowering vines. He is massively tall, and wherever he walks plants sprout from the earth. Where others see a tangle of vegetation, Cairith sees the plan of nature unfolding. All cervans profess a kinship to Cairith. But rather than claiming him as a direct ancestor, he is seen as a guardian spirit. Some say he was the first to be born from the land when the Dawnmother gave Everden life.": "凯里斯被描述为一只强大的雄鹿，鹿角上长满了苔藓和花藤。他身材高大，无论他走到哪里，植物都会从地里冒出来。别人看到的是纠结的植被，而凯里斯看到的是大自然的计划正在展开。所有塞万人都声称与凯里斯有亲属关系。但与其说他是直接的祖先，不如说他被看作是一个守护神。有人说他是曙光之母赋予埃弗顿生命时，第一个从土地上诞生的人。",
	"Cairith guided the first cervans, and blessed them with many gifts so that they might survive in the primitive forest. One of these gifts, the power of The Sight, is attributed to Cairith. Certain cervans are gifted with The Sight, and this allows them to glimpse events that have occurred in the past, present, and future.": "凯里斯引导着第一批雪人，并以许多礼物赐予他们，使他们能够在原始森林中生存。其中一种天赋，即 \"视力 \"的力量，归功于凯里斯。某些塞万人被赋予了 \"视力\"，这使他们能够瞥见过去、现在和未来发生的事件。",
	"Cairith finds reverence among rangers, druids, healers, and community leaders. Paladins invoke his dogma to give heart to those they defend. Cervan diviners gifted with the Sight call upon Cairith in their rituals. Cairith also has many followers among common people, especially humblefolk who have suffered hardships.": "凯里斯在游侠、德鲁伊、治疗师和社区领袖中受到敬重。圣骑士们援引他的教条来为他们所捍卫的人提供心。有视力天赋的塞万族占卜师在他们的仪式中召唤凯里斯。凯里斯在普通人中也有很多追随者，特别是那些遭受过苦难的卑微的人。",
	"An Amaranthine of heroism and valor, Gaspard is \"The Champion\". In life, Gaspard was a great jerbeen leader. Upon his death, the Great Rhythm took him, and his spirit ascended as an Amaranthine. It is believed he was chosen to serve as an example of greatness, one to inspire others for generations to come. Tales of his mortal adventures have earned him renown. He traveled the whole of Everden, with his closest companions, slaying monsters, unseating tyrants, and bringing peace and prosperity wherever he roamed.": "加斯帕德是一个具有英雄主义和英勇精神的阿马兰斯人，是 \"冠军\"。在生活中，加斯帕德是一位伟大的杰比恩领袖。在他死后，伟大的节奏带走了他，他的灵魂作为阿玛兰斯人升华了。人们相信，他被选为伟大的榜样，激励着一代又一代的人。他在凡间的冒险故事为他赢得了声誉。他和他最亲密的伙伴们走遍了整个埃弗顿，杀死了怪物，推翻了暴君，并在他游荡的地方带来和平与繁荣。",
	"Gaspard's followers believe the actions of an individual ripple outwards, affecting those around us, which in turn can embolden anyone to achieve greatness. The example of Gaspard teaches jerbeen to affect others with acts of courage, heroism, and kindness.": "加斯帕德的追随者认为，个人的行为会向外荡漾，影响我们周围的人，这反过来又能使任何人有勇气实现伟大。加斯帕德的例子教导杰比恩用勇气、英雄主义和仁慈的行为影响他人。",
	"At times, Gaspard has been at odds with other Amaranthine. Before he ascended, there is a tale of him meeting Kren, where he was forced to show no sign of fear, lest she eat him and his companions. Thankfully, his composure kept his group strong, and in turn their bravery kept him strong. They escaped with their lives.": "有时，加斯帕德会与其他阿玛兰丁人发生冲突。在他升天之前，有一个关于他遇到克伦的故事，在那里他被迫不表现出恐惧，以免她吃掉他和他的同伴们。值得庆幸的是，他的镇定使他的团队保持坚强，反过来，他们的勇敢也使他保持坚强。他们逃过了一劫。",
	"Gaspard's example has lead many to heed the paladin's call. Gaspard is worshiped by warriors who seek to match his exploits, as well as bards who seek to inspire others through the telling of heroic tales.": "加斯帕德的榜样使许多人听从了圣骑士的召唤。加斯帕德被那些试图与他的功绩相媲美的战士们所崇拜，也被那些试图通过讲述英雄故事来激励他人的吟游诗人所崇拜。",
	"Humblefolk hold summer festivals in his honor. These holidays include storytelling, puppet shows, and magnificent jousts where armored jerbeens mounted on tamed wolves put on a spectacle of courage and daring before the crowds.": "谦卑的人们为了纪念他而举行夏季的节日。这些节日包括讲故事、木偶戏和华丽的比武，在比武中，骑在被驯服的狼身上的铠甲骑士在众人面前上演勇气和胆量的奇观。",
	"Known as \"The Uncaring\", \"The All-Knowing Stars\", and \"The Whisperer\", Hath is an Amaranthine that humblefolk and birdfolk alike struggle to understand. In spite of this conflict, Hath is revered by the mapach. According to them, Hath was a constellation of stars who listened carefully to the Nightfather. In ancient times, the Nightfather spoke and spread his vast wisdom across the primordial darkness. He spoke of night, of time, and of the worlds beyond life. The constellation listened and grew wise, too wise to remain as stars. Thus, it became a part of the Great Rhythm as the Amaranthine of fear, doubt, and secrets. This is why, the tellers say, the Nightfather no longer speaks.": "哈斯被称为 \"无情的人\"、\"全知的星 \"和 \"低语者\"，他是一个卑微的人和鸟人都难以理解的亚马逊人。尽管有这种冲突，哈斯还是受到了马帕奇人的敬重。根据他们的说法，哈斯是一个仔细聆听夜神的星星星座。在远古时代，夜父在原始的黑暗中说话并传播他巨大的智慧。他谈到了黑夜，谈到了时间，谈到了生命以外的世界。星座听了之后变得聪明起来，聪明得不能再聪明，就像星星一样。因此，它成为大节奏的一部分，成为恐惧、怀疑和秘密的苋菜。这就是为什么，讲述者说，夜神不再说话了。",
	"Ever since, Hath has whispered its unsettling secrets to the creatures below, speaking quietly so the other stars cannot hear. Mapachs were not the first to hear its voice, but they claim to be the first to truly make use of its secrets. While priests of Hath do not necessarily \"hear\" the words of the stars, mapachs believe that Hath speaks in subtle ways. Those frightened while traveling at night or caught in dangerous situations are bestowed with cautious and crafty thoughts by Hath. If heeded, one may survive. If ignored, one may die. Either way, Hath, The Uncaring, is apathetic.": "从那时起，哈斯就向下面的生物低声诉说它那令人不安的秘密，悄悄地说话，让其他星星听不到。马帕奇人不是第一个听到它声音的人，但他们声称是第一个真正利用它的秘密的人。虽然哈斯的祭司不一定能 \"听到 \"星星的话，但马帕奇人相信哈斯会以微妙的方式说话。那些在夜间旅行时受到惊吓或陷入危险境地的人，会被Hath赋予谨慎和狡猾的想法。如果听从了，就可能活下来。如果被忽视，则可能死亡。无论是哪种方式，无情的哈斯都是冷漠的。",
	"The stars teach the importance of trusting in oneself and keeping your wits about you, even in dire situations. When a mapach gets a shiver of premonition, something they could never have known, it is said to be the whispers of Hath they have heard.": "星星教导人们相信自己和保持智慧的重要性，即使在恶劣的情况下。当一个mapach得到一个颤抖的预感，一些他们不可能知道的事情，据说是他们听到了哈斯的低语。",
	"Hath has few followers, and most are mapachs. Rangers and travelers passing through dangerous parts of the Wood at night often pay homage to the All-Knowing Stars. While some pray to this Amaranthine for guidance, others hope not to hear Hath's voice, as the stars only whisper to those in peril. Warlocks make pacts with this Amaranthine for knowledge of the worlds beyond life. Most consider this practice to be rather reckless—The Uncaring is known to exact a terrible price for such secrets. Some lose their mind delving into the vast reservoir of knowledge that Hath is all too eager to supply.": "哈斯的追随者不多，大多数是马帕奇人。夜间经过森林危险地区的游侠和旅行者经常向全知的星星致敬。有些人向这位阿玛兰蒂恩祈求指引，有些人则希望不要听到哈斯的声音，因为星星只对处于危险中的人说悄悄话。术士们为了获得生命以外的世界的知识而与这个阿玛兰蒂恩签订契约。大多数人认为这种做法是相当鲁莽的--众所周知，无畏者会为这种秘密付出可怕的代价。有些人在钻研哈斯急于提供的巨大知识库时，会失去理智。",
	"Henwin, the patron spirit of hedges, is venerated by humblefolk of all kinds. They are the Amaranthine of balance, and teach that all things in the forest must be respected, as all are connected in a great web of kindness. It is thanks to the sun that the plants grow, and because the plants grow, all living things have food. Decayed food turns into soil, which nourishes more life. The teachings of Henwin ask followers to take into consideration the many kindnesses which brought each of them into being and nourished them throughout their lives.": "亨文是树篱的守护神，受到各种谦卑的人们的敬仰。他们是平衡的苋菜，教导人们必须尊重森林中的所有事物，因为所有事物都在一个巨大的仁慈之网中相连。正是因为有了太阳，植物才得以生长，而由于植物的生长，所有生物都有了食物。腐烂的食物变成了土壤，滋养了更多的生命。亨文的教义要求追随者考虑到使他们每个人产生并滋养他们一生的许多仁慈。",
	"It is only fitting, then, that Henwin is said to be a hedgehog who spends their life in the forest. Storytellers say that they reside in an ancient part of the world, hidden from the eyes of most mortals, where they inhabit a tangle of roots from every forest that has ever grown. Here they tend to a garden of moss, fungi, and insects, helping to keep the living roots healthy. Henwin ensures that even the husks of withered plants can provide for the vegetation and creatures who rely on dead things for sustenance.": "因此，据说Henwin是一只在森林中度过一生的刺猬，这是非常合适的。讲故事的人说，他们居住在世界的一个古老的地方，隐藏在大多数凡人的视线之外，在那里他们居住在一个由每一个曾经生长过的森林的根系组成的纠缠中。在这里，他们照料着一个由苔藓、真菌和昆虫组成的花园，帮助保持活根的健康。亨文确保即使是枯萎植物的外壳也能为植物和依靠死物维持生计的生物提供食物。",
	"Unlike other Amaranthine, Henwin is not described as male or female. Being a spirit of balance, they are considered to possess traits of all genders. They are often depicted carrying a yellow rose, which is their symbol. When a yellow rose blooms, it is said to be Henwin, blessing a forest with the beauty of their quiet grace. These roses are often given as tokens of friendship.": "与其他阿马兰特人不同，Henwin不被描述为男性或女性。作为一种平衡的精神，他们被认为拥有所有性别的特征。他们经常被描绘成携带一朵黄玫瑰，这是他们的象征。当一朵黄玫瑰绽放时，据说是Henwin，用他们安静的优雅之美来祝福森林。这些玫瑰常常作为友谊的信物被赠送。",
	"Henwin teaches understanding, and respect for the web of kindness that connects all life. If death is dealt indiscriminately, the web may become damaged. Although it is resilient, the web is still as fragile as one made from spider's silk. It is the duty of all who follow Henwin to strengthen the web and to help maintain the balance which supports all living things.": "亨文教导人们理解和尊重连接所有生命的仁慈之网。如果不分青红皂白地对待死亡，这张网可能会被破坏。虽然它有弹性，但这张网仍然像蜘蛛丝做的一样脆弱。所有追随Henwin的人都有责任加强这张网，帮助维持支持所有生物的平衡。",
	"Henwin is followed by druids, who take the message of nature's web of kindness to heart. Henwin's druids can be found protecting groves and leading communities, keeping both safe from those with harmful intentions. Priests of Henwin often invoke the Amaranthine Henwin's name to protect the fauna, flora, and folk under their care. Gardeners honor Henwin by keeping plots filled with a diverse array of complementary plant and insect life.": "亨文有德鲁伊跟随，他们将自然界的仁慈之网的信息铭记于心。亨文的德鲁伊可以被发现保护丛林和领导社区，使两者不受那些有害的意图的影响。亨文的祭司们经常引用阿马兰蒂恩-亨文的名字来保护他们所照顾的动物、植物和民众。园丁们通过在地块上种满各种互补的植物和昆虫来纪念亨文。",
	"The Amaranthine of predation and guile, Kren is portrayed as a great fox-like beast, whose form is usually obscured by shadows. The only known parts of her form are her fangs and her eyes, glinting as they catch the light. Kren appears in many tales, as often a villain as a hero, and even then it is rare that her motives are laudable. Yet, one can learn from Kren, for her stories often demonstrate how hubris can be exploited, how heroes can be laid low, and how there is no weapon so deadly as flattery.": "克伦是捕食和狡诈的阿玛兰丁，被描绘成一只巨大的狐狸般的野兽，其形态通常被阴影所掩盖。她的外形唯一已知的部分是她的獠牙和她的眼睛，当它们捕捉到光线时闪闪发光。克伦出现在许多故事中，既是反派又是英雄，即使如此，她的动机也很少是值得称赞的。然而，人们可以从克伦身上学到东西，因为她的故事常常表明傲慢如何被利用，英雄如何被压制，以及没有比奉承更致命的武器。",
	"The patron spirit of the vulpin, Kren teaches them to walk the line between savagery and sophistication, and how and when each should be used. For many other humblefolk she demonstrates the value of cunning, showing that no creature is so wise or mighty that they cannot be taken advantage of.": "作为庸人的守护神，克伦教导他们如何在野蛮和老练之间行走，以及如何和何时应该使用每一种手段。对于许多其他卑微的人来说，她展示了狡猾的价值，表明没有任何生物是如此聪明或强大，以至于他们不能被利用的。",
	"Stories of her origin are often vague and contradictory. A popular vulpin myth tells that Kren came from a time before life existed on Everden. That she was an ancient force, ready to feast on a world full of new and fresh meat, who simply awoke when the Dawnmother and Nightfather set creation in motion. Others believe she was the first vulpin, who ascended from an ordinary fox. As the story goes, Kren tricked the Dawnmother into allowing her to watch over the Amaranthine's two divine feathers. Kren ate a single feather and became the Amaranthine of guile. This is why the Dawnmother only carries one feather in her beak.": "关于她的起源的故事往往是模糊的和矛盾的。一个流行的庸俗神话说，克伦来自埃弗登星球上生命存在之前的时代。她是一种古老的力量，准备在这个充满新鲜肉体的世界上大快朵颐，当黎明之母和黑夜之父开始创造时，她就醒了。还有人认为她是第一只狐狸，从一只普通的狐狸升起。正如故事所言，克伦欺骗了曙光之母，让她看管阿玛兰蒂恩的两根神圣的羽毛。克伦吃了一根羽毛，成为狡猾的阿玛兰蒂恩。这就是为什么曙光之母的嘴里只带一根羽毛的原因。",
	"Kren isn't worshiped in the same way as other Amaranthine. Rather, Kren is invoked in stories to teach the dangers of vainglory. Many outlaws keep shrines to her patronage. These individuals include thieves, smugglers, and purveyors of black market goods. Priests of Kren use her stories to teach others how to be crafty and cunning, but also to be cautious of the wiles of others. There are those, however, who invoke Kren for dark rites and rituals to gain power for themselves. Kren is always ready to make bargains with such supplicants, but all who do are fated to be devoured by her when their lives finally come to an end.": "克伦并不像其他亚马逊人那样受到崇拜。相反，克伦在故事中被援引来教导虚荣心的危险。许多亡命之徒都有神龛供奉她。这些人包括盗贼、走私者和黑市商品的销售者。克伦的祭司们用她的故事教导他人如何狡猾，但也要谨慎对待他人的诡计。然而，也有一些人援引克伦进行黑暗的仪式和典礼，为自己获得权力。克伦总是准备与这些祈求者进行交易，但所有这样做的人在他们的生命最终结束时都注定要被她吞噬。",
	"This legendary artifact was created by a powerful wizard, crafted from the finger of a towering, ancient elemental aspect of frost. It is so cold to the touch that it numbs any skin it comes into contact with, although an attuned character is immune to this effect.": "这个传说中的神器是由一个强大的巫师创造的，由一个高大的、古老的冰霜元素的手指制作而成。它是如此的冰冷，以至于它接触到的任何皮肤都会被麻痹，尽管一个经过调整的角色对这种效果是免疫的。",

	"The helm itself is simple leather, hide, scale, or plate, but the magic imbued into it comes from the feather.

	"Nature, or the forest, might be quite the distance from our homes, Twitch streams, or stages where we play RPGs like {@i 5th Edition} (because oddly enough that's the magical world we live in now). We throw dice onto surfaces made of trees whose history we are woefully clueless of. Did the tree have a story, or a family of owls living in it, or a fox kit that sheltered a storm beneath its branches? We don't know these tales as we weave our own, but the connection is still there. We're still tromping through the wilderness and smelling the fresh air and fearing its dangers, even if it's in our imagination.": "大自然，或者说森林，可能离我们的家、Twitch流，或者我们玩RPG游戏的舞台（%0%）（因为奇怪的是，这就是我们现在生活的神奇世界）有相当的距离。我们把骰子扔到由树木制成的表面上，而这些树木的历史我们完全不知道。这棵树是否有一个故事，或住着一个猫头鹰家族，或在它的树枝下躲避风暴的狐狸伴侣？在我们编织自己的故事时，我们不知道这些故事，但这种联系仍然存在。我们仍然在荒野中跋涉，闻着新鲜空气，害怕它的危险，即使是在我们的想象中。",
	"Storytelling on its own has always been connected to nature. Legends of animals as gods or animals as human-like protagonists permeate all cultures. The Native American stories of the trickster Raven, the Medieval fable of the {@i Owl and the Nightingale}, or something as obvious and simple as {@i Grimm's Fairy Tales} are all examples of how the natural world around us has shaped storytelling. The magic of animals and their usually unseen lives intrigues us, sparks our imagination, and we see a lot of ourselves in them when we finally slow down enough to look. Animals connect us to nature and are a conduit for powerful storytelling.": "讲故事本身就一直与自然有关。关于动物为神或动物为人类主角的传说渗透到所有文化中。美国本土的乌鸦捣蛋的故事，中世纪的{@i Owl and the Nightingale}寓言，或者像{@i Grimm's Fairy Tales}这样明显而简单的东西，都是我们周围的自然世界如何塑造故事的例子。动物的魔力和它们通常不为人知的生活让我们感到好奇，激发我们的想象力，当我们最终放慢脚步去看时，我们会在它们身上看到很多自己的影子。动物将我们与自然联系在一起，是一个强有力的讲故事的渠道。",
	"This is why I believe roleplaying games have had such a resurgence in the past few years, because we're looking for a connection to the world around us. We're looking for a way to get away from screens, to forget about our complicated lives, and to live as heroes with problems we can solve, not just listen to on the news and worry about. We can help people, we can be heroes, and we have magic. Even in the imagination, these things are incredibly powerful.": "这就是为什么我相信角色扮演游戏在过去几年有如此大的复苏，因为我们正在寻找与我们周围世界的联系。我们正在寻找一种远离屏幕的方法，忘记我们复杂的生活，并作为英雄生活在我们可以解决的问题中，而不仅仅是听新闻和担心。我们可以帮助别人，我们可以成为英雄，而且我们有魔法。即使在想象中，这些东西也是令人难以置信的强大。",
	"In Humblewood, we're going back to our roots as storytellers, using nature and the animals around us to adventure in a world of fantasy. We have so much technology surrounding us every day, getting out into nature isn't an option for many. Our jobs are time consuming, our lives are hard and complicated, our food is grown in places we will never see and sits on a shelf for our consumption wrapped in plastic. These things disconnect us from the story of nature, from the story of life and the changing of seasons and our connection to the world around us. In reality, even the humble pigeon has an interesting life, we just don't see it as we pass them on city streets without giving them a second look.": "在汉伯伍德，我们要回到我们作为讲故事者的根源，利用自然和我们周围的动物，在一个幻想的世界里冒险。我们每天都有这么多的技术围绕着我们，对许多人来说，走到大自然中去不是一个选择。我们的工作耗费时间，我们的生活艰难而复杂，我们的食物是在我们永远不会看到的地方种植的，并在塑料包装的货架上供我们食用。这些东西使我们与大自然的故事脱节，与生命的故事和季节的变化以及我们与周围世界的联系脱节。在现实中，即使是卑微的鸽子也有一个有趣的生活，只是我们没有看到，因为我们在城市街道上与它们擦肩而过，没有多看它们一眼。",
	"I've loved birds since I can remember, they've always been how I connected to nature. I've rescued birds since I was 10 and I've worked with the smallest of hummingbirds to the massive moody, Red Tailed hawk named Ivan whose mew I cleaned in college. When I lived in Los Angeles, I began rescuing pigeons because they were everywhere, forgotten pets of colonists and invasive to the habitat they lived in. These birds were smart, funny, and ignored by almost every animal shelter you took them to. They were the lost and forgotten of the animal world, and that's why I fell in love with them. They had stories to tell, and every one of them has their own personality and quirks.": "从我记事起，我就喜欢鸟类，它们一直是我与大自然联系的方式。我从10岁起就开始救助鸟类，从最小的蜂鸟到巨大的喜怒无常的红尾鹰，名叫伊万，我在大学时曾为它清理喵喵。当我住在洛杉矶时，我开始救助鸽子，因为它们无处不在，是被殖民者遗忘的宠物，对它们生活的栖息地具有侵略性。这些鸟儿聪明、有趣，而且几乎被你带去的每个动物收容所忽视。它们是动物世界中的迷失者和被遗忘者，这就是我爱上它们的原因。它们有故事可讲，而且每只都有自己的个性和怪癖。",
	"Humans are not that different from animals. If we pay attention to them, we can understand them, save them, live with them, and honor them. The more compassion we have for animals the better our world will be. Telling their stories is just as important as telling our own, and helps us connect to and have compassion for the other creatures on our planet. So I encourage you to make your own legends in Humblewood, and then go to the forest and see them for yourself. Maybe they'll have a story of their own to tell you, too.": "人类与动物没有什么不同。如果我们关注它们，我们就能理解它们，拯救它们，与它们一起生活，并尊重它们。我们对动物的同情心越强，我们的世界就越美好。讲述它们的故事和讲述我们自己的故事一样重要，有助于我们与地球上的其他生物建立联系，并对它们抱有同情心。因此，我鼓励你在汉伯伍德创造你自己的传说，然后到森林里去亲自看看它们。也许它们也会有自己的故事要告诉你。",

	"When approaching the art direction for Humblewood, I wanted to express that this is a world full of vibrant, diverse characters, living in an expansive forest with a rich and intricate history. The driving force behind Humblewood as a concept was the desire to create a visually compelling world that felt alive, and that meant a world that could feel wonderful and welcoming, magical and mysterious. It also meant a world full of secrets, hidden dangers, and obstacles for a party of adventurers to overcome.": "当接近汉伯伍德的艺术指导时，我想表达的是，这是一个充满了充满活力、多样化的人物的世界，他们生活在一个有着丰富而复杂的历史的广阔的森林中。汉伯伍德作为一个概念背后的驱动力是希望创造一个视觉上引人注目的世界，让人感觉到生命力，这意味着一个可以感觉到美妙和温馨、神奇和神秘的世界。这也意味着一个充满秘密、隐藏的危险和障碍的世界，供冒险者的队伍去克服。",
	"When I was young, the films and books I devoured with the most enthusiasm were the ones that appealed to audiences both young and old, whose characters may happen to be adorable woodland animals, but still bravely explored a mosaic of complex, confronting themes that we continue to puzzle over well into our adult years. These are the stories that left a significant impression on me, that I continue to revisit to this day.": "在我年轻的时候，我最热衷的电影和书籍是那些吸引年轻人和老年人的电影和书籍，它们的角色可能碰巧是可爱的林地动物，但仍然勇敢地探索了复杂的、对抗性的主题，我们在成年后仍会继续困惑。这些故事给我留下了深刻的印象，直到今天我还在继续重温这些故事。",
	"Roleplaying games are wonderful for many reasons, one being that they can provide a form of escape, or they can mirror reality. They can help us understand and process experiences in our own lives through an entirely different lens, and they give you a unique kind of freedom to be whoever or whatever you want to be, options for which there is no shortage in Humblewood—whether you are a sneaky mapach, a brave little strig, or a cunning corvum with a secret heart of gold, the only limit, as ever, is your imagination.": "角色扮演游戏之所以精彩，有很多原因，其中一个原因是它们可以提供一种逃避的形式，或者它们可以反映现实。它们可以帮助我们通过一个完全不同的视角来理解和处理我们自己的生活经历，它们给你一种独特的自由，让你成为你想成为的人或事，在Humblewood不乏这样的选择--无论你是一个阴险的Mapach，一个勇敢的小strig，还是一个狡猾的corvum，有一颗秘密的黄金之心，唯一的限制，一如既往，就是你的想象力。",
	"As artists we have to give careful consideration to every facet of the world, certainly the designs of our main characters and our myriad of monsters, but also what a character's home might look like, what kind of fabrics they might wear, and how should we design this bottle of vintage vulpin-crafted elderberry wine? We have illustrated forests flooded with beams of light, tangled and treacherous swamps you must battle your way through with determination, and cosy interiors where you can almost smell the jerbeen-sized loaves baking in the oven. The love is very often in the details, just as some of the most significant moments in a campaign can be the quiet ones, the small words exchanged at the campfire, or the tiny clues indicating a much larger mystery to unravel.": "作为艺术家，我们必须仔细考虑世界的方方面面，当然，我们的主角和无数的怪物的设计，但也要考虑角色的家可能是什么样子，他们可能穿什么样的面料，以及我们应该如何设计这瓶古老的Vulpin制作的接骨木酒？我们绘制了充斥着光束的森林、纠结而险恶的沼泽地，你必须坚定地穿过这些地方，还有舒适的室内环境，你几乎可以闻到烤箱里烘烤的杰比恩大小的面包。爱往往体现在细节中，正如一场战役中最重要的一些时刻可能是安静的时刻，在篝火旁交换的小话，或表明要解开更大的谜团的微小线索。",
	"Creating this project has been an unforgettable journey, full of as many surprises, twists and turns as the overgrown paths of Humblewood itself. I have had an affinity for nature and animals my entire life, which has been my primary source of inspiration for much of my personal work. I remember when I first sat down and sketched the first iteration of a brave little knight owl, who we have now named Riffin, and I could never have imagined in that moment how the idea behind this little owl would evolve into a fully realised world, lovingly crafted by our team of designers, writers and artists, for players to explore.": "创作这个项目是一个难忘的旅程，像汉伯伍德的杂草丛生的小路一样充满了惊喜、曲折和转折。我一生都对自然和动物情有独钟，这是我许多个人作品的主要灵感来源。我记得当我第一次坐下来画出一只勇敢的小猫头鹰（我们现在把它命名为Riffin）的第一稿时，我在那一刻根本无法想象这只小猫头鹰背后的想法会如何演变为一个完全实现的世界，由我们的设计师、作家和艺术家团队精心打造，供玩家探索。",

	"In the far away world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and the humblefolk. Together they share the Wood and its bountiful resources.": "在遥远的埃弗登世界，在一个大洲的东海岸，有一片巨大的森林，依偎在山和海之间。这就是谦卑之林，一个古老而神奇的地方，它哼着无尽的歌，随着生与死的大节奏而歌唱。森林，正如它的居民所知道的那样，与其他森林不同。这里的树木古老而强大，稀有的标本可以达到小山一样的高度。在这里，熟悉的野兽成长为不寻常的大小，带有森林特有的标记和图案。这个地区也是两组类似动物的人形种族的家园，鸟人和卑微的人。他们共同分享森林和它丰富的资源。",
	"In the early years, the birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest. These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the \"Bandit Coalition.\" To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest's canopy. Joining forces with the humblefolk, the birdfolk army, known as the \"Perch Guard\", drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood.": "早年，鸟人和卑贱的人在森林周围的小村庄里彼此相邻而居。这些孤立的社区很容易受到一个自称为 \"强盗联盟 \"的强盗和掠夺者组织的攻击。为了保护自己免受联盟的侵害，鸟人在森林的树冠上建造了坚固的城市。鸟人军队与卑微的人类联合起来，被称为 \"鲈鱼卫队\"，赶走了强盗，给这个地区带来了和平与安全。随着时间的推移，鸟人文化不断传播，首都阿尔德心成为森林中最具政治影响力的地方。",
	"But the Wood has also known sorrow. Not long after the founding of Alderheart, a massive forest fire known as \"The Great Calamity\" burned a portion of the Wood. The origins of the fire are unknown, but it left the area permanently damaged. To this day, it is called the \"Scorched Grove,\" an arid field of ash that has since become home to many strange flame-infused creatures.": "但森林也有过悲伤。在Alderheart成立后不久，一场被称为 \"大灾难 \"的大规模森林火灾烧毁了森林的一部分。这场大火的起因不明，但它给该地区留下了永久性的破坏。时至今日，这里被称为 \"焦土林\"，是一片干旱的灰烬地，从此成为许多奇怪的火焰生物的家园。",
	"The Tenders, an organization of druids and mystics, dedicate themselves to healing the Scorched Grove with natural magics. Set up in conclaves around the Wood, they provide aid whenever forest fires strike. Yet, since the Grove's burning, the Wood has known relatively few fires. Nature's balance, though, can be disrupted by a single spark.": "补给者，一个由德鲁伊和神秘主义者组成的组织，致力于用自然魔法治愈焦土森林。他们在森林周围建立了小团体，每当森林火灾发生时，他们都会提供帮助。然而，自从丛林被烧毁后，森林就很少发生火灾了。不过，大自然的平衡可能会被一个小小的火花所破坏。",
	"Recently, fires have begun to rage through the Wood with a strength and fury not seen since ages past. Forest-dwellers are again being displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in Alderheart, and perch-dwellers are doing what they can to keep themselves safe up in their canopy sanctuaries. Relations between the humblefolk and birdfolk are tense. Moreover, a newly invigorated Bandit Coalition swells in numbers. Its sights are set upon Alderheart, where those displaced by the flames seek a means of survival.": "最近，大火开始在森林中肆虐，火势之猛烈是历代以来所没有的。森林居民再次被赶出他们的家园，在阿尔德心寻求庇护，而栖息地居民则尽其所能地在他们的天幕避难所中保护自己的安全。卑微的人和鸟人之间的关系很紧张。此外，一个新成立的强盗联盟的人数也在增加。他们把目光投向了阿尔德心，在那里，那些因火焰而流离失所的人正在寻找生存的方法。",

	"This chapter outlines the ten core races, five birdfolk and five humblefolk, who make up the majority of characters found in the Wood. It also details various character creation options, new class options, backgrounds, feats, and spells to help you make your own Humblewood adventurer.": "本章概述了十个核心种族，五个鸟人和五个谦卑人，他们构成了在森林中发现的大多数角色。它还详细介绍了各种角色创建选项、新的等级选项、背景、特技和法术，以帮助你打造自己的谦卑森林冒险者。",
	"The birdfolk races of Humblewood are as diverse and unique as the forest itself. Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as \"perches\") throughout the Wood. Despite regional differences and cultural peculiarities among the different kinds of birdfolk in the Wood, the birdfolk races nevertheless share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. This solidarity has allowed them to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age.": "汉伯伍德的鸟人种族就像森林本身一样多样而独特。只有技艺高超的人才能在森林中生存，而鸟人已经成为森林地面和树冠的主人，在整个森林中建立了几个定居点（俗称 \"栖息地\"）。尽管森林中不同种类的鸟人之间存在着地区差异和文化特点，但鸟人种族仍然共享他们的大部分文化、语言、历史和起源神话。这种团结使他们能够一起工作和繁荣，在森林中创造了一个持续了一个时代的和谐。",
	"While a diverse group, adapted for a variety of environments within the Wood, birdfolk also share several physical traits which have allowed them to find common ground in the construction of their perches. Beyond the obvious physical similarities, all birdfolk possess arms covered in feathers, which extend into wing-like appendages. While incapable of true powered flight, the strong hollow bones and lightweight bodies of birdfolk allow them to easily use their feathered arms to glide, and unless severely encumbered, all birdfolk can recover gracefully from what would otherwise be a deadly fall. In some birdfolk races these wings have grown strong enough to bear their owners upwards in a mighty flap, while others instead developed talons which make for both deadly defensive weapons and useful tools for scaling tall trees.": "虽然是一个多样化的群体，适应森林中的各种环境，但鸟人也有几个共同的身体特征，这使得他们在建造他们的栖息地时能够找到共同点。除了明显的身体相似性，所有的鸟人都拥有覆盖着羽毛的手臂，这些手臂延伸成类似翅膀的附属物。虽然没有能力进行真正的动力飞行，但鸟人强壮的空心骨和轻盈的身体使他们能够轻松地使用他们的羽毛手臂进行滑翔，除非有严重的障碍，否则所有的鸟人都能从本来是致命的坠落中优雅地恢复。在一些鸟人种族中，这些翅膀已经强大到足以在强大的扇动中把它们的主人往上带，而另一些则发展出爪子，既是致命的防御武器，也是攀爬高大树木的有用工具。",
	"The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart, and from this bastion of safety their ruling body, the Birdfolk Council, makes decisions which impact all of Humblewood. The birdfolk are well-defended from outside threats thanks to the Perch Guard, a force of soldiers trained in both aerial and ground combat, that keeps their cities and the denizens within safe.": "鸟人已经确立了自己在汉伯伍德不可忽视的政治力量。他们在伟大的树Alderheart上塑造了他们强大的首都，在这个安全堡垒上，他们的统治机构，鸟人委员会，做出了影响整个汉伯伍德的决定。鸟人对外界的威胁有很好的防御，这要归功于Perch Guard，这是一支受过空中和地面战斗训练的士兵队伍，保证了他们的城市和居民的安全。",
	"While Alderheart has been a beacon of peace and harmony for many years, the coming of the fires has thrown the region into chaos. The Perch Guard forces are spread thin across the canopy cities, barely able to secure the main roads for merchants while keeping their homes safe from the blazes. Now the great birdfolk cities face more threats from bandits and forest fires than ever before. Through it all, though, the birdfolk trust in solidarity, between themselves and the diverse groups of habitants who call their perches home, to weather the coming storm as they have so many times before.": "虽然多年来阿尔德心一直是和平与和谐的灯塔，但大火的到来使该地区陷入混乱。栖息地卫队的力量被分散到各个天幕城市，勉强能够为商人确保主要道路的安全，同时保证他们的家园不被大火烧毁。现在，伟大的鸟人城市面临着比以往更多的来自土匪和森林火灾的威胁。然而，在这一切中，鸟人相信他们自己和以他们的栖息地为家的不同居民群体之间的团结，以抵御即将到来的风暴，就像他们以前多次经历的那样。",
	"Not all denizens of Humblewood are birdfolk. The term \"humblefolk\" is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood's history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven't always seen eye to eye.": "并非所有汉伯伍德的居民都是鸟人。在整个森林里，\"谦卑人 \"这个词被用来指代那些生活在离森林地表稍近的非鸟人民族。与鸟人不同，他们共同的语言、历史、神话和文化使他们在汉伯伍德的大部分历史中都能和谐地存在，而谦卑人代表了一群不同的民族、文化和看待世界的方式，他们中的许多人并不总是能看到眼睛。",
	"Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the \"Humblefolk Treaty\" and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. The birdfolk offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted their offer. Over time, more and more humblefolk migrated to newly-established birdfolk perches, though many found birdfolk architecture to be restrictive for creatures without wings. In the same way, some groups of birdfolk, feeling too crowded within the booming perches, began to spread out and seek shelter within small woodland villages. Even today, the birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.": "数年前，森林底层的人们达成了一项协议，联合起来对抗流窜的强盗，平息了肆虐整个森林的内斗。这项协议被称为 \"卑微者条约\"，并由鸟人见证，他们当时刚刚开始塑造阿尔德心的树干。鸟人在他们伟大的城市里为卑微的人们提供安全，许多人接受了他们的提议。随着时间的推移，越来越多的卑微者移居到新建立的鸟人栖息地，尽管许多人发现鸟人的建筑对没有翅膀的生物来说是有限制的。同样地，一些鸟人群体感到在繁荣的栖息地内太过拥挤，开始分散开来，在小的林地村庄内寻求庇护。即使在今天，选择生活在森林地面上的鸟人发现自己被鄙视了，因为在鸟人社会中，树冠上的生活被认为是正当的。",
	"After the establishment of the treaty, humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, although now in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous...until the fires came.": "条约签订后，谦卑人开始再次生活在树下的小型林地村庄里，尽管现在他们与一些地面居住的鸟人组成了更加多样化的社区。随着《谦卑人条约》的扩大，允许谦卑人在危机时刻召唤栖息地卫队，以及鸟人民兵为商队保持道路安全，森林真正进入了一个黄金时代。许多平民的生活是和平和繁荣的......直到大火来临。",
	"With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified: those who found prosperity in the birdfolk cities have adopted a perch-dweller's perspective, while those who live in the woodlands face a constant threat from brigands and forest fires. Others have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment. Yet, where the treaty holds, vibrant humblefolk communities can still be found. The humblefolk are resilient, and each race will devise a way to survive in this dangerous wood.": "随着火焰的蔓延，卑微的村民向过度扩张的栖息地卫队请求援助，但看到援助到达得太晚，甚至根本没有。更糟糕的是，多年之后，卑微人社区之间的分歧加剧了：那些在鸟人城市发现繁荣的人采用了栖息地居民的观点，而那些生活在林地的人则面临着来自强盗和森林火灾的持续威胁。其他人甚至已经离开，加入了新改革的强盗联盟，他们不仅看到了一条生存之路，还看到了与栖息在鸟人中的人报复违背誓言和不平等待遇的机会。然而，在条约生效的地方，仍然可以找到充满活力的卑微人社区。卑贱的人们具有顽强的生命力，每个种族都会想出办法在这片危险的森林中生存。",

	"Your character is more than just a collection of rules. Here are a few tools to help you flesh out the look and feel of your character.": "你的角色不仅仅是一个规则的集合。这里有一些工具可以帮助你充实你的角色的外观和感觉。",
	"The sex or gender of a character doesn't confer any special bonuses or penalties. Playable races do not exhibit physical characteristics based on sex, and traits such as plumage, markings, and size difference are not associated with a specific sex or gender. The most significant variations in physical appearance come down to a character's subrace.": "一个角色的性别并不赋予任何特殊的奖励或惩罚。可玩的种族不表现出基于性别的身体特征，而诸如羽翼、斑纹和尺寸差异等特征也不与特定的性别相关联。外貌上最重要的变化来自于一个角色的亚种族。",
	"The table below can be used to decide your character's height and weight. These are based on the information provided in each race's description, and reflect the natural variation that occurs within the different folk of the Wood.": "下面的表格可以用来决定你的角色的身高和体重。这些都是基于每个种族描述中所提供的信息，并反映了木头人的不同民俗中所发生的自然变化。",
	"To use this table, first locate your character's race, and roll for their height modifier. Add this result in inches to the base height shown in the previous column. Next, using the appropriate column, roll for your weight modifier. Some races have a flat weight modifier. If this is the case, simply use the number provided in this column. Then, take the number you rolled for the height modifier, and multiply it by the weight modifier. Add this result in pounds to your race's base weight.": "要使用这个表格，首先要找到你的角色的种族，然后滚出他们的身高修正值。把这个结果以英寸为单位加到前一栏所示的基本身高上。接下来，使用适当的栏目，滚出你的体重修正值。有些种族有一个统一的体重修正值。如果是这种情况，只需使用这一栏中提供的数字。然后，用你掷出的身高修正数，乘以体重修正数。把这个结果以磅为单位加到你的种族的基本体重上。",
	"You may notice that the weights for birdfolk races are significantly lower than for humblefolk of similar size. The birdfolk have hollow bones, reinforced by special internal structures that act as struts. Along with other weight-reducing adaptations, this allows birdfolk to glide. Birdfolk characters are not negatively impacted by their lower weight.": "你可能会注意到，鸟人种族的重量明显低于类似体型的卑鄙小人。鸟人的骨头是空心的，由特殊的内部结构加固，起到支撑的作用。与其他减轻重量的适应性一起，这使得鸟人可以滑行。鸟人角色不会因其较低的体重而受到不利影响。",

	"The sizes listed in the racial descriptions represent suggested averages of the various races. Players can adjust these sizes depending on the kind of birdfolk or humblefolk character they'd like to play. Some varieties of strig, a race that takes their physical characteristics from owls, could be smaller sized, around 3 feet tall, if desired. Similarly, raptors, a race whose physical characteristics resemble birds of prey, could reach around 5 feet in height. For the sake of simplicity we advise that, regardless of the physical measurements of a character, they follow the size category rules of their race (Medium or Small). In the lore, this can be expressed by saying that even a small strig is solid and strong, where even a taller raptor is light and agile. This will make calculating things that rely on size categories much easier, rather than having to remember which size variant a player has chosen for a race.": "种族描述中列出的尺寸代表了不同种族的建议平均数。玩家可以根据他们想扮演的鸟人或卑鄙小人的角色来调整这些尺寸。如果需要的话，从猫头鹰获得身体特征的某些品种的斯特里格（strig），可以是较小的尺寸，大约3英尺高。同样，猛禽，一个身体特征类似于猛禽的种族，身高可以达到5英尺左右。为了简单起见，我们建议，无论一个角色的身体尺寸如何，他们都要遵循其种族的尺寸类别规则（中型或小型）。在传说中，这可以表述为：即使是一只小的斯特里格也是坚实有力的，而即使是一只高大的猛禽也是轻盈敏捷的。这将使依赖体型分类的计算变得更加容易，而不是要记住玩家为一个种族选择的体型变量。",
	"Alternatively, if the races presented here are too big when placed in comparison to humans in other campaign settings, size categories can be adjusted accordingly. This is entirely a matter of taste. It is recommended to do whatever makes the most sense for the kinds of worlds you'd like to build and the kinds of stories you'd like to tell.": "另外，如果这里介绍的种族与其他战役环境中的人类相比显得太大，可以对尺寸类别进行相应调整。这完全是一个品味问题。建议做任何对你想建立的世界类型和你想讲述的故事类型最有意义的事情。",
	"The Wood covers a vast area of different environments. As such, birdfolk and humblefolk can showcase a variety of different forms.

	"Cervan characters could be imagined as elk, moose, or antelopes. Any hoofed creature with horns would fit the bill, especially those native to forest or mountainous environments. While not every cervan has horns, the ability to grow them is seen as a blessing of Cairith, and is a part of their culture.": "塞万的角色可以想象成麋鹿、驼鹿或羚羊。任何有角的有蹄动物都适合，尤其是那些原产于森林或山区环境的动物。虽然不是每个塞万人都有角，但长角的能力被看作是凯里斯的祝福，也是他们文化的一部分。",
	"Birds which are known for their dark coloration, such as crows, blackbirds and grackles, would be a good visual fit. Despite typically being dark-feathered, a variety of colorful corvids exist. Jays, nutcrackers, and jackdaws are good examples.": "以深色著称的鸟类，如乌鸦、黑鸟和斑鸠，将是一个很好的视觉搭配。尽管通常是深色羽毛，但也有各种色彩斑斓的鸟类存在。鸦类、坚果鸟和乌鸦就是很好的例子。",
	"No matter which type of bird is being used for visual inspiration for your corvum, it is important that they have at least one black feather. Black feathers on a corvum are known as the \"Mark of Gesme\" and they are thought to impart some of Gesme's reckless curiosity.": "无论哪种类型的鸟被用来作为你的corvum的视觉灵感，重要的是它们至少有一根黑色的羽毛。雕像上的黑色羽毛被称为 \"Gesme的标志\"，它们被认为能传授Gesme的一些鲁莽的好奇心。",
	"Gallus characters are usually represented by land fowl of all kinds, ranging from those with small rounded bodies, suited to ground life, to those with longer proportions. Waterfowl, such as ducks or geese, could be used as visual inspiration for communities of gallus living by Humblewood's wetlands. Other fowl, such as peacocks, could also be used. While not closely-related to fowl, herons, storks, and bitterns could be a good reference for taller, marshland-dwelling communities of gallus.": "胆小鬼的特征通常由各种陆禽来代表，从那些身体小而圆、适合地面生活的陆禽到那些比例较长的陆禽。水禽，如鸭子或鹅，可以作为生活在汉伯伍德湿地边上的gallus社区的视觉灵感。其他禽类，如孔雀，也可以使用。虽然与禽类关系不密切，但苍鹭、鹳和苦鸟可以作为较高的、居住在沼泽地的五倍子群落的良好参考。",
	"Gallus characters with ostentatious, colorful plumage are generally better suited to the bright gallus subrace, while those with modest, earth-toned feathers might be better suited to the huden gallus subrace.": "具有炫耀性的、五彩缤纷的羽毛的胆小鬼一般更适合于明亮的胆小鬼亚种，而那些具有适度的、大地色调的羽毛的胆小鬼可能更适合于胡登胆小鬼亚种。",
	"While inspired by hedgehogs, having a hedge character based on a quilled animal that inhabits forests, such as a porcupine, would also make sense. Although they would probably not be native to Humblewood, armadillos, pangolins, or echidnas would also work.": "虽然灵感来自于刺猬，但以栖息在森林中的被子动物为基础的刺猬角色，如豪猪，也会有意义。虽然它们可能不是Humblewood的原生动物，但犰狳、穿山甲或针鼹鼠也可以。",
	"The jerbeens are inspired by jerboas, a kind of jumping mouse. Other small rodents with mouse-like proportions, including chinchillas, could be used for visual inspiration as well. Though a greater stretch, the jerbeen's speed, size, and communal way of life would make them an ideal analog for races based on rabbits or hares.": "jerbeens的灵感来自于jerboas，一种跳跃的老鼠。其他具有类似老鼠比例的小型啮齿动物，包括龙猫，也可以用来作为视觉灵感。虽然更夸张，但杰比安的速度、体型和集体生活方式将使它们成为基于兔子或野兔的比赛的理想类似物。",
	"Lumas are inspired by doves and pigeons, but their size and high charisma means that small songbirds such as chickadees, wrens, sparrows, and cardinals would also be a good fit. A bird-of-paradise could be used as well due to their focus on performance, though they might be better suited for visitors to Humblewood from more tropical regions. Birds with brighter or more decorative plumage would correspond to sera lumas, while those with more muted feathers would be better as sable lumas.": "卢马的灵感来自鸽子和鸽子，但它们的体型和高魅力意味着小型鸣禽，如鸡冠鸟、鹪鹩、麻雀和红雀也会很适合。由于天堂鸟注重表现，所以也可以使用，尽管它们可能更适合于来自更多热带地区的汉伯伍德的游客。羽毛较亮或装饰性较强的鸟类将对应于sera lumas，而那些羽毛较暗的鸟类则更适合作为sable lumas。",
	"Inspired by raccoons, mapach characters can reference members of the weasel family, such as ferrets and badgers. Mapachs are hearty and crafty, and possess a climbing speed, which means many members of this family, including polecats, would be good fits.": "受浣熊的启发，马帕奇的角色可以参考黄鼠狼家族的成员，如雪貂和獾。马帕奇酣畅淋漓，狡猾无比，并且拥有攀爬的速度，这意味着这个家族的许多成员，包括竹竿猫，都会很适合。",
	"Raptors take after smaller birds of prey, like falcons and hawks, but using larger species, like eagles or vultures as a reference would also work for raptor characters. Maran raptors could also take visual inspiration from seabirds, notably petrels or shearwaters, due to their swim speed.": "猛禽模仿较小的猎物，如猎鹰和老鹰，但使用较大的物种，如老鹰或秃鹰作为参考，也适用于猛禽角色。马兰猛禽也可以从海鸟那里获得视觉灵感，特别是海燕或剪羊毛，因为它们的游泳速度。",
	"Strigs usually resemble owls of all kinds. Owls comprise a very large and diverse family of birds, and examples can be found which are small, large, or unique in appearance. For larger, more intimidating strigs, the great gray owl or giant scops owl can provide a robust presence, while smaller strigs could take inspiration from the little owl, or boreal owl. Regardless of their size, stout strigs tend to be bulkier, with denser feathers, while swift strigs have more slender and streamlined bodies.": "斯特里格通常类似于各种类型的猫头鹰。猫头鹰是一个非常大的、多样化的鸟类家族，可以找到小的、大的或独特外观的例子。对于较大的、更具威慑力的绞杀者来说，大灰猫头鹰或大鸱鸮可以提供一个强大的存在，而较小的绞杀者可以从小猫头鹰或北方猫头鹰那里得到灵感。不管它们的尺寸如何，粗壮的绞龙往往体积较大，羽毛较密，而敏捷的绞龙则有更细长和流线型的身体。",
	"Vulpins generally look like foxes, but an alternative visual reference would be wolves, coyotes, or other hunting canines that could be commonly found in a forest environment. Vulpins should be represented as wild animals, to illustrate the duality of their sophisticated yet savage nature. Breeds of tamed dogs would not be a good fit.": "狐狸一般看起来像狐狸，但另一种视觉参考是狼、土狼或其他在森林环境中常见的狩猎犬类。狐狸精应该被表现为野生动物，以说明其复杂而野蛮的本质的双重性。驯养的狗的品种不会是一个好的选择。",
	"Race determines the language your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional language of your choice. You are free to select these from among the languages offered in other 5e material, but there are several languages which are specific to the Wood.": "种族决定了你的角色默认能说的语言，而你的背景可能让你获得一种或多种你选择的额外语言。你可以从其他5e材料中提供的语言中自由选择这些语言，但有几种语言是木头人特有的。",
	"The standard languages listed below are part of common life in Humblewood, and are spoken widely. Sylvan, along with various dialects of Primordial (Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran) are uncommon languages known only by few in the Wood, but they can prove exceptionally useful in communicating with the various fey and elemental Humblewood residents.": "下面列出的标准语言是汉伯伍德普通生活的一部分，并且被广泛使用。西尔凡语和各种原始方言（奥兰语、阿奎恩语、伊格南语和泰兰语）是不常见的语言，只有伍德中的少数人知道，但它们在与各种精灵和元素的汉伯伍德居民交流时可以证明非常有用。",
	"Each birdfolk race possesses a unique and mystical connection to the element of air, which allows them to understand Auran from birth, although they are unable to speak it naturally. Birdfolk who wish to become fluent in this dialect must take the time to learn. Because Auran is a dialect of Primordial, birdfolk innately understand Aquan, Ignan, and Terran as well, though not perfectly. Compared to Auran, the other dialects of Primordial sound stilted or broken to birdfolk. While they can understand simple concepts presented in these dialects, more complicated matters are lost in translation.": "每个鸟人种族都与空气元素有着独特而神秘的联系，这使他们一出生就能理解奥兰语，尽管他们无法自然地说出这种语言。希望精通这种方言的鸟人必须花时间来学习。由于奥兰语是一种原始方言，鸟人天生也能理解阿奎恩语、伊格恩语和泰兰语，尽管并不完美。与奥兰语相比，其他的原始方言对鸟人来说听起来很生硬或蹩脚。虽然他们可以理解这些方言中的简单概念，但更复杂的事情却在翻译中丢失了。",
	"Birdfolk takes the place of Common in Humblewood. As the language of trade and custom, folk of the Wood take the time to learn it. Other 5e races who choose to visit Humblewood will want to know Birdfolk. Likewise, birdfolk or humblefolk characters visiting other lands should add Common to their language list.": "在汉伯伍德，Birdfolk取代了Common的位置。作为贸易和风俗的语言，森林里的人们花时间来学习它。其他选择访问汉伯伍德的5e种族会想知道鸟人语。同样地，鸟人或谦卑人的角色在访问其他地方时，也应该在他们的语言列表中加入普通话。",

	"In the beginning, there was only the sound of wings. Faint at first, the distant beats were easy to miss, but as time passed they grew stronger, faster, until they could be heard across the great unending dark. Then, with a single flap, creation burst forth: fire, ice, air, water, soil and sky, all came from the sound of feathers that resonated throughout the cosmos. This is the Great Rhythm, and by the Great Rhythm are all things moved. The Rhythm tells the sun when to set, and the moon when to rise. The Rhythm tells the seeds when to flower, the trees when to shed their leaves, and the snows when to fall. The essence of everything there is comes from the Great Rhythm. One day, the Rhythm may cue the end of creation—but there will be no end to the Rhythm itself. As every downbeat has an upbeat to follow it, so too will the cycles of nature eventually start again—for even though the Rhythm can be faint at times, it is everlasting and eternal.": "一开始，只有翅膀的声音。起初很微弱，远处的节拍很容易被错过，但随着时间的推移，它们越来越强，越来越快，直到它们在巨大的无尽黑暗中都能被听到。然后，随着一次扇动，创造迸发出来：火、冰、空气、水、土壤和天空，都来自在整个宇宙中产生共鸣的羽毛声。这就是伟大的节奏，所有的东西都被伟大的节奏所感动。韵律告诉太阳何时落下，月亮何时升起。节奏告诉种子何时开花，树木何时落叶，雪花何时飘落。一切事物的本质都来自于伟大的韵律。有一天，节奏可能会提示创造的结束，但节奏本身不会结束。就像每一个下降的节拍都有一个上升的节拍一样，自然界的循环也将最终重新开始--尽管节奏有时会很微弱，但它是永恒的，而且是永恒的。",
	"Every denizen of the forest, from the large to the small, from predator to prey, knows of The Great Rhythm: the beating force that is the pulse of life itself. To the birdfolk, the Rhythm began with the sound of beating wings, but other folk of the Wood tell that it began with the thundering of hooves, the padding of paws, or with a tiny heartbeat. Birdfolk believe that two great spirits emerged from the Rhythm. They were the first Amaranthine: Ardea, whose wings usher in the dawn, and Tyton, whose wings are the shadow of night. They are the avatars of life and death, and keepers of the Rhythm.": "森林里的每一个居民，从大到小，从捕食者到猎物，都知道伟大的节奏：那是生命本身的跳动力量。对鸟人来说，节奏始于翅膀拍打的声音，但森林里的其他居民则说，它始于马蹄的雷鸣声、爪子的垫子，或者是一个微小的心跳。鸟人相信，有两个伟大的灵魂从节奏中出现。他们是第一个阿玛兰特人。阿蒂亚（Ardea），它的翅膀迎来了黎明；泰顿（Tyton），它的翅膀是夜晚的阴影。他们是生命和死亡的化身，也是节奏的守护者。",

They are the immortals, who have been given new life by the Rhythm, and act as its guardians, maintaining the balance of nature.": "就像我们需要一颗心脏来使我们的脉搏跳动一样，节奏也需要一个鼓手。节奏的核心在于阿玛兰蒂人。他们是不死之身，被节奏赋予了新的生命，并作为节奏的守护者，维持着自然的平衡。",
	"The Amaranthine are the gods of Everden. They are entrusted with maintaining the cosmic balance known as the Great Rhythm.

The Amaranthine tend to keep to themselves, and rarely meddle in each other's affairs.": "Amaranthine是Everden的诸神。他们被委以重任，负责维护被称为大节奏的宇宙平衡。与其他环境中的神灵不同，阿玛兰蒂恩人很少彼此争吵，因为阿玛兰蒂恩人之间的任何纷争都是对自然平衡本身的威胁。阿玛兰蒂恩人倾向于保持自我，很少插手对方的事务。",
	"Though each Amaranthine is a powerful being in their own right, holding a great degree of autonomy over their dominion, each understands that they are but a small part of a greater whole. Like the themes of a concerto, the Amaranthine are the harmonies that create the Great Rhythm.": "尽管每一个阿玛兰斯人本身就是一个强大的存在，对他们的统治区拥有很大程度的自主权，但每个人都明白，他们只是一个更大的整体中的一小部分。就像协奏曲的主题一样，阿玛兰斯人是创造大节奏的和声。",
	"The Amaranthine are venerated by all races of Humblewood, although birdfolk and humblefolk worship them differently. The five whose origins are described in the \"Tales of the Amaranthine\" (Altus, Clhuran, Gesme, Reya, and Hanera), are primarily worshiped by birdfolk, and they (along with Ardea and Tyton) form the most common pantheon worshiped across the Wood.": "阿玛兰斯人受到汉伯伍德所有种族的敬仰，尽管鸟人和汉伯伍德人对他们的崇拜有所不同。在 \"阿玛兰人的故事 \"中描述了五个人的起源（阿尔图斯、克赫兰、格斯梅、雷亚和哈内拉），他们主要受到鸟人的崇拜，他们（与阿迪亚和泰顿一起）构成了整个森林中最常见的被崇拜的万神殿。",

	"In the perches, humblefolk Amaranthine tend to be viewed as a folk religion alongside the primary birdfolk pantheon. Occasionally, perch-dwelling humblefolk will have small shrines in their homes, or in their shops dedicated to their Amaranthine.": "在栖息地，小民的阿玛兰蒂恩往往被视为一种民间宗教，与主要的鸟民神殿并列。偶尔，住在栖息地的小民会在家里或商店里有小神龛，专门供奉他们的阿玛兰蒂恩。",
	"While these Amaranthine go largely overlooked by most birdfolk, some who have taken the time to learn their legends pay homage to the featherless Amaranthine. This bothers a few humblefolk, but the priests of these Amaranthine understand that each one is but a reflection of the Great Rhythm, and welcome any birdfolk to learn from them.": "虽然这些亚马逊人在很大程度上被大多数鸟人所忽视，但一些花时间学习他们的传说的人对无羽亚马逊人表示敬意。这让一些卑微的人感到不安，但这些阿玛兰蒂恩的祭司们明白，每一个人都是伟大节奏的反映，并欢迎任何鸟人向他们学习。",

	"With the birth of Ardea and Tyton, the world was set into motion. Where once there was nothing but barrens, the land came alive with the coming of the Amaranthine, and the world began its endless cycle of life and death. Their arrival split the formless sky into day and night. They created the sun and the moon, and the succession of light and dark which emerged from their movement across the heavens told all life when to act and when to rest. Ardea and Tyton were born from opposite parts of the Great Rhythm. Each knows of the other's existence, but they keep to their separate spheres, meeting only in the early hours of dawn and the late hours of dusk to exchange dominion over the sky. In seasons of warmth, Ardea has a greater reign over the sky, while in seasons of bitter cold, Tyton's power increases.": "随着阿迪雅和泰顿的诞生，世界开始运转。曾经除了荒地什么都没有的地方，随着阿玛兰斯人的到来，土地变得生机勃勃，世界开始了生与死的无尽循环。他们的到来将无形的天空分为白天和黑夜。他们创造了太阳和月亮，从他们在天上的运动中出现的光和暗的连续，告诉所有生命何时行动，何时休息。阿迪雅和泰坦从大节奏的不同部分诞生。每个人都知道对方的存在，但他们保持着各自的领域，只在黎明的早期和黄昏的晚期相遇，交换对天空的统治权。在温暖的季节，阿迪亚对天空有更大的统治权，而在严寒的季节，泰坦的力量会增加。",
	"The two Amaranthine created much of the life in Humblewood. Ardea suffused the days with sun-loving flowers, plants, and animals, while Tyton baptized the night with insects and animals that embrace the dark. They birthed sentient races, and from them originate all birdfolk, the first of their children, followed shortly after by the humblefolk.": "两位阿玛兰特人创造了汉伯伍德的大部分生活。阿迪雅用喜欢阳光的花草和动物充实了白天，而泰顿则用拥抱黑暗的昆虫和动物洗礼了夜晚。他们孕育了有知觉的种族，所有的鸟人都是从他们那里起源的，他们的第一个孩子，不久之后就是谦卑人。",
	"Originally, all birdfolk were the same. It was difficult to distinguish them from the birds of the forest, as they even possessed the ability to fly. One day, the entire flock of birdfolk decided on a grand contest of gift-giving, to prove which of them was the most worthy to lead. Ardea agreed to act as judge; whoever could present her with the greatest gift would become leaders among her children. For an entire season, birdfolk searched and scrounged, gathered and hunted, returning with trinkets, baubles, gifts great and small. Though Ardea commended all her children for their gifts, only five were truly deserving of her boon.": "本来，所有的鸟人都是一样的。很难将他们与森林中的鸟类区分开来，因为他们甚至拥有飞行的能力。有一天，整个鸟人群体决定进行一场盛大的送礼比赛，以证明他们中谁最有资格领导。阿迪雅同意担任裁判；谁能给她送上最大的礼物，谁就能成为她孩子中的领袖。在一整个季节里，鸟民们寻找和搜刮，收集和猎取，带着小饰品、小玩意、大小礼物回来。虽然阿迪雅赞扬了她所有孩子的礼物，但只有五个孩子真正值得她的恩赐。",
	"Gesme, Reya, Hanera, Altus, and Clhuran: these five became leaders of the birdfolk. They inspired tales, devotion, and gave the birdfolk races their distinct forms and skills. These great ones went on to become part of the Great Rhythm as keepers of nature's balance and protectors of birdfolk across Everden, eventually ascending and joining the Amaranthine. The followers of each of the five were granted new forms and great gifts, to match their leader's exploits. Yet, to accept these gifts, something needed to be lost. This is why the birdfolk of today can only glide: their gift of flight was taken as the price for becoming something new.": "Gesme、Reya、Hanera、Altus和Clhuran：这五个人成为鸟人的领袖。他们激发了故事、奉献精神，并赋予鸟人种族以独特的形式和技能。这些伟大的人继续成为大节奏的一部分，作为自然平衡的守护者和整个Everden的鸟人的保护者，最终上升并加入Amaranthine。五个人的追随者都被赋予了新的形式和伟大的礼物，以配合他们领袖的功绩。然而，要接受这些礼物，需要失去一些东西。这就是为什么今天的鸟人只能滑翔：他们的飞行天赋被当作成为新事物的代价。",
	"The first to present Ardea with a worthy gift was Gesme, a clever birdfolk who saw potential in the world that her kin could scarcely imagine. She had observed the great orb of fire that Ardea had placed high in the sky, and how Ardea had positioned it a great distance from the land and its creatures, so it would warm them gently without burning them. But Gesme also saw that the sun vanished with the coming of night, when the creatures of the dark began to prowl, and thought: \"How remarkable would it be to have some of that fire in the world?\"": "第一个给阿迪雅送上一份有价值的礼物的是Gesme，她是一个聪明的鸟人，在这个世界上看到了她的亲属几乎无法想象的潜力。她观察到阿迪雅在高空放置的巨大火球，以及阿迪雅如何将它安置在离土地和生物很远的地方，这样它就能温和地温暖它们，而不会烧毁它们。但Gesme也看到，当黑暗中的生物开始游荡时，太阳随着黑夜的到来而消失了，他想。\"如果世界上有一些这样的火，那将是多么了不起啊！\"",
	"Other birdfolk laughed at Gesme as she spent days plotting, and reading the sky. She examined every tree, from the great ash to the supple willow. Each day she carried a new branch in her beak, dropping many in frustration. The birdfolk were puzzled, but dismissed her actions. Then, one day at dawn, when the sun was at its lowest point in the sky, Gesme appeared with an oak branch in her beak. Without a word, she took off straight into the horizon. She flew for what seemed like ages, but the oak branch was light and did not trouble her. As she neared the sun her feathers, talons, and beak began to blacken in the heat. Still, she persisted. The oak was hardy and spry, and did not wither. Finally, she stuck the tip of the branch into the sun, igniting it. Hastily she flew back toward the ground, with the branch burning bright in her talons. The oak was patient, and did not burn up, keeping the flame steady as Gesme returned from the sky.": "其他鸟人嘲笑Gesme，因为她花了好几天时间来策划，并阅读天空。她检查每一棵树，从大白蜡到柔软的柳树。每天她都用嘴叼着一根新的树枝，沮丧地扔下许多树枝。鸟人不解，但对她的行为不以为然。然后，有一天黎明时分，当太阳在天空中处于最低点时，Gesme出现了，嘴里叼着一根橡树枝。她一言不发，直接飞向地平线。她似乎飞了很久，但橡树枝很轻，并没有给她带来麻烦。当她接近太阳时，她的羽毛、爪子和喙开始在高温下变黑。不过，她还是坚持了下来。橡树很坚韧，很有活力，没有枯萎。最后，她把树枝的顶端伸进太阳，点燃了它。她急忙向地面飞去，树枝在她的爪子里燃烧着。橡树很有耐心，没有被烧毁，当Gesme从天上回来时，它保持了火焰的稳定。",
	"\"See what I have brought here!\" she bragged, as the astounded birdfolk looked upon her scorched feathers. \"This will keep us warm on the cold days of winter, and safe through the long nights!\"": "\"看看我带来了什么！\"她吹嘘道，因为那些惊愕的鸟人看着她烧焦的羽毛。\"这将使我们在寒冷的冬日里保持温暖，并安全度过漫长的夜晚！\"",
	"Ardea was at first concerned at the presence of fire in the world, for she knew the forests could burn, and that misuse of the fire would bring harm to Everden. But, when she saw the birdfolk gather around the fires, and felt the gentle warmth a small flame could provide to her children, she was overcome with happiness.": "Ardea起初对世界上出现的火感到担忧，因为她知道森林会燃烧，而且滥用火会给Everden带来伤害。但是，当她看到鸟人聚集在火堆周围，感受到小火苗能给她的孩子们带来的温和温暖时，她被幸福所征服。",
	"\"This,\" she declared, \"is worthy of a boon.\"": "\"这，\"她宣称，\"是值得夸奖的。\"",
	"And thus was Gesme changed. Set ablaze with the flames of knowledge and creativity, she became an Amaranthine. The forms of her followers changed too, and they became the first corvums. They were gifted with a bit of her cleverness and foresight, but Ardea gave them all black talons, feathers, and beaks as a reminder of the price Gesme paid to bring fire into the world.": "因此，Gesme被改变了。她被知识和创造力的火焰点燃了，成为了一名阿马兰斯人。她的追随者们的形态也发生了变化，他们成为第一批科沃姆人。他们被赋予了她的聪明才智和远见卓识，但阿迪亚给了他们所有的黑色爪子、羽毛和喙，以提醒他们格斯梅为将火种带入世界而付出的代价。",
	"The second to present a worthy gift was Reya, whose hunting skills were second to none. Though she was small, she was nimble, swift, and wise in the ways of the forest. Reya was capable and reliable, but birdfolk deemed her too independent to be a leader. She would travel the length and breadth of the land on her hunts, sometimes not returning for weeks at a time.": "第二个送出有价值的礼物的是雷亚，她的狩猎技能首屈一指。虽然她个子不高，但她灵活、敏捷，而且对森林的方式很有见地。雷亚有能力，也很可靠，但鸟人认为她太独立了，不能成为一个领导者。她在打猎的时候会走遍整个大地，有时一连几个星期都不回来。",
	"During one of her journeys Reya encountered a stranger. The traveler's true form was hidden under a cloak, but they could fly and clearly felt as comfortable in the trees as any birdfolk. They had heard of Reya's skill in racing, hunting, and navigating the forest, and proposed three challenges, to which Reya agreed.": "在她的一次旅行中，雷亚遇到了一个陌生人。这个旅行者的真实形态隐藏在斗篷下，但他们可以飞行，显然在树上的感觉和任何鸟人一样舒适。他们听说了雷亚在赛车、狩猎和在森林中导航方面的技能，并提出了三个挑战，雷亚同意了。",
	"For the first event, the pair moved to a patch of open sky overlooking rugged plains. There was a rocky outcropping in the distance; whoever flew there first would be the winner. The race began, and Reya immediately fell behind, the cloaked figure moving faster than Reya had ever seen.": "在第一场比赛中，两人来到一片开阔的天空，俯瞰崎岖的平原。远处有一块岩石；谁先飞到那里，谁就是赢家。比赛开始了，雷亚立即落在了后面，那个隐身的身影比雷亚见过的任何时候都要快。",
	"Reya summoned all her strength to keep up, beating her wings like never before. Yet the traveler kept inching forward, and she was unable to close the gap in time.": "雷亚鼓起全部力量跟上，以前所未有的方式拍打翅膀。然而，旅行者不断向前推进，而她无法及时缩小差距。",
	"Reya steeled herself for the next challenge. They flew to the meadows, where small creatures grazed, and it was decided that the first to catch five hares would be the winner. Reya moved with purpose, confident no one could best her skills with a bow, a tool of her own creation. Each of her shots found its mark, until she had but a single hare left to catch. But when Reya looked over at the traveler, she was shocked to see them waiting impatiently with a full complement.": "雷亚为下一个挑战做好了准备。他们飞到草地上，那里有小动物在吃草，决定谁先抓到五只野兔谁就是赢家。雷亚带着目的前进，她相信没有人能够胜过她的弓箭技术，这是她自己创造的工具。她的每一次射击都找到了目标，直到她只剩下一只野兔可以捕捉。但当雷亚看向旅行者时，她震惊地看到他们带着满满的装备不耐烦地等待。",
	"For the third and final event, the pair flew to the center of the forest. The first to emerge into the open fields beyond would be the victor. These were forests Reya knew well, and she was certain she would win. As soon as they had started though, Reya saw the traveler alight, darting through the trees as if weightless. Reya kept pace, using every trick she could to give herself an advantage. Still the traveler pulled ahead, if only by inches, and emerged victorious.": "在第三个也是最后一个项目中，两人飞到了森林的中心。第一个出现在外面的空地上的人将是胜利者。这些是雷亚熟悉的森林，她确信她会赢。然而，他们刚一开始，雷亚就看到旅行者下了车，像失重一样飞快地穿过树林。雷亚紧跟其后，用尽一切办法使自己获得优势。但旅行者仍然领先，即使只是几英寸，并取得了胜利。",
	"Reya landed on a nearby branch and cursed her lack of skill. After a moment of pause however, she regained her composure, and thanked her competitor. Yet the traveler laughed, a sound so familiar, Reya wondered why she hadn't noticed before.": "雷亚落在附近的一根树枝上，诅咒自己缺乏技巧。然而，在停顿了一会儿后，她恢复了平静，并感谢她的竞争者。然而，那个旅行者笑了，这个声音如此熟悉，雷亚想知道为什么她以前没有注意到。",
	"\"You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.\" The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.": "\"你没有什么可羞愧的，鸟人。我看到你的技能是真的。你是第一个在每项赛事中都如此接近我的人，而这并不容易。\" 旅行者脱下他们的斗篷，雷亚不敢相信自己的眼睛。她受到了风本身的挑战。",
	"It swirled, spinning a cloak out of the very clouds, which it placed around Reya. \"Consider this a gift, for providing me with such sport.\" Reya thanked the wind, and with that, it departed, caressing Reya's feathers in a familiar breeze.": "它旋转着，从云层中旋转出一件斗篷，放在雷亚身边。\"把这个当作礼物吧，为我提供这样的运动。\" 雷亚感谢了风，然后它离开了，在熟悉的微风中抚摸着雷亚的羽毛。",
	"When the time came to present a gift, Reya offered Ardea her cloak of clouds, along with the story of her adventure. As Reya told her tale, Ardea could see the eyes of the other birdfolk light up with excitement. When Reya had finished, Ardea returned Reya's cloak to her, saying the story of her adventure was the rarer gift. Reya was changed, and became the Amaranthine of wind, archery, and exploration. Those she inspired became the first raptors. They began to take on a nomadic lifestyle, finding their fortune day by day as Reya once did and told tales of their own adventures by the light of the campfire.": "当赠送礼物的时候，雷亚把她的云朵斗篷和她的冒险故事一起送给了阿迪尔。当雷亚讲述她的故事时，阿迪雅可以看到其他鸟人的眼睛因兴奋而亮了起来。当雷亚讲完后，阿迪雅把雷亚的斗篷还给了她，说她的冒险故事是更稀有的礼物。雷亚被改变了，成为了风、射箭和探索的阿玛兰蒂恩。她所激励的人成为第一批猛禽。他们开始采取游牧的生活方式，像雷亚曾经做的那样，一天天地寻找自己的财富，并在篝火的光芒下讲述自己的冒险故事。",
	"The third to present a precious gift was Hanera, a gentle birdfolk and the first to shift her focus away from the sky. Rather than live in the trees with other birdfolk, Hanera made a home for herself below the canopy. She cared for the soil and the earth, and in return the earth gifted her with wisdom. From the earth, Hanera learned to speak with plants—knowledge she used to better care for them. She soon earned fame among the birdfolk, as one who grew the largest and best-tasting crops.": "第三个送上珍贵礼物的是哈内拉，她是一个温柔的鸟人，也是第一个将注意力从天空转移的人。哈内拉没有和其他鸟人一起生活在树上，而是在树冠下为自己建了一个家。她关心土壤和大地，作为回报，大地给了她智慧。从大地那里，哈内拉学会了与植物对话--她用这些知识来更好地照顾它们。她很快就在鸟人中赢得了名声，因为她种出了最大、最美味的作物。",
	"\"These crops,\" Hanera thought, \"are the finest gift I could offer to our Mother.\" And so she set about planting a large garden, its bounty reserved for Ardea.": "\"这些作物，\"哈内拉想，\"是我能提供给我们母亲的最好礼物。\" 于是，她开始种植一个大花园，把它的丰收留给阿迪雅。",
	"One day, while tending to her garden, Hanera saw a family of haggard travelers making their way out of the woods. When they saw Hanera, the mother begged her for aid.": "有一天，哈内拉在照料她的花园时，看到一家憔悴的旅行者正从树林里走出来。当他们看到哈内拉时，母亲向她乞求援助。",
	"\"Please, kind sister, we are in great need. We were traveling through the forest when a creature attacked me and wounded my wing. We escaped, but I cannot fly. Please, help us, we are terribly hungry.\"": "\"拜托，好心的姐姐，我们非常需要。我们在森林中旅行时，一个生物袭击了我，伤了我的翅膀。我们逃脱了，但我不能飞。请帮助我们，我们非常饥饿。\"",
	"Hanera knew that she couldn't feed herself and this family while storing crops for Ardea. Even still, she could not turn them away in their desperate state. She offered to share her home and her food for as long as the travelers needed, making sure their needs were met before saving any food for Ardea.": "哈内拉知道，她无法在为阿迪亚储存农作物的同时养活自己和这个家庭。即使如此，她也不能在他们绝望的情况下拒绝他们。她提出，只要旅行者需要，她就与他们分享她的家和她的食物，确保他们的需求得到满足，然后再为阿迪雅保存任何食物。",
	"The travelers stayed with Hanera for many nights while the mother healed. Each day, Hanera would prepare the family meals, telling the plants of their plight. The plants understood, and were honored to nourish the weary and wounded birdfolk. In return, Hanera ensured their seeds were saved and planted again, so their lives would continue indefinitely.": "在母亲痊愈期间，旅行者在哈内拉家住了很多个夜晚。每天，哈内拉都会为家人准备饭菜，告诉植物们他们的困境。植物们明白了，并且很荣幸地滋养了疲惫和受伤的鸟人。作为回报，哈内拉确保它们的种子被保存并再次种植，因此它们的生命将无限期地延续下去。",
	"At night, Hanera applied medicine to the mother's wound made from the leaves of kindly herbs. By the end of the season the mother had healed, the family was in good health, and they gratefully flew away.": "晚上，哈内拉用善良的草药叶子给母亲的伤口上药。在这个季节结束时，母亲已经痊愈，一家人都很健康，他们感激地飞走了。",
	"When the day finally came for birdfolk to present their gifts, all Hanera could offer Ardea was a few fruits and vegetables. She wove them together along with flowers she had grown, attempting to make her offering look more cheerful.": "当鸟人赠送礼物的日子终于到来时，哈内拉能提供给阿迪雅的只有一些水果和蔬菜。她把这些东西和她种的花编织在一起，试图让她的礼物看起来更欢快。",
	"\"I'm sorry, Mother Stork,\" Hanera said. \"I had meant to present you with a great harvest, but this is all I could provide.\"": "\"我很抱歉，鹳妈妈，\"哈内拉说。\"我本想给你带来巨大的收获，但这是我能提供的全部。\"",
	"Ardea took the wreath, and spoke gladly: \"You have given me more than enough, for you see my child, I received your compassion for an entire season.\" As Ardea spoke, celestial messengers appeared by her side, and together they transformed into the birdfolk family Hanera had so tenderly cared for.": "阿迪雅接过花环，高兴地说道：\"你给我的已经够多了，因为你看我的孩子，我接受了你一整个季节的怜悯。\" 当阿迪雅说话时，天体的使者出现在她身边，他们一起变成了哈内拉如此温柔地照顾过的鸟人家庭。",
	"For her charity, Hanera received the Amaranthine's boon: her feathers turned green and grew into vines and shoots, adorned with the most beautiful flowers. Other birdfolk stared in awe, and those who followed Hanera became the first gallus, blessed with her inspiring kindness, as well as her closeness with the earth and all growing things.": "因为她的慈善，哈内拉得到了阿马兰斯的恩惠：她的羽毛变成了绿色，长成了藤蔓和嫩芽，上面点缀着最美丽的花朵。其他鸟人敬畏地注视着，那些追随哈内拉的鸟人成为第一批胆小鬼，受到她鼓舞人心的善意的祝福，以及她与大地和所有生长物的亲密关系。",
	"The fourth to present a commendable gift was Altus, whose hunting skills were second only to Reya's, though Altus journeyed the Wood to test his limits rather than explore as Reya did. Altus felt pure joy when overcoming obstacles. He loved the cold seasons and challenged himself by hunting at night. His nocturnal existence granted Altus a perspective other birdfolk lacked.": "第四位赠送值得称赞的礼物的是阿尔图斯，他的狩猎技能仅次于雷亚，尽管阿尔图斯在森林中旅行是为了测试他的极限，而不是像雷亚那样探索。阿尔图斯在克服障碍时感到纯粹的快乐。他喜欢寒冷的季节，并通过夜间打猎来挑战自己。他的夜行生活赋予了阿尔图斯一种其他鸟人所缺乏的视角。",
	"\"What if I gifted Ardea something she has never seen before?\" he thought. \"Yes! I shall hunt the moon, and present it to her, so that she may see its lovely glow.\" This would be unthinkable to any other birdfolk, but Altus was resolute, confident his gift would please Ardea.": "\"如果我把她从来没有见过的东西送给阿迪雅，会怎么样？\"他想。\"是的！我将猎取月亮，把它送给她，让她看到它可爱的光芒。\" 这对任何其他鸟人来说都是不可想象的，但阿尔图斯很坚决，相信他的礼物会让阿迪雅高兴。",
	"However, he was neither as skilled or nimble as Reya, nor as clever or cunning as Gesme. His arrows would not scratch the moon, and despite his great strength, he could not move it. But Altus was stubborn, for many nights he tried and failed to bring down his quarry. The more he tried, the more frustrated he became. Altus even thought he could hear the moon's laughter reflected in the babbling brooks and rippling ponds, mocking his futile efforts. Still, Altus remained determined.": "然而，他既不像雷亚那样熟练和灵活，也不像格西姆那样聪明和狡猾。他的箭不会划伤月亮，尽管他有强大的力量，却无法移动它。但阿尔图斯很固执，许多个夜晚他都在尝试，但都没能打倒他的猎物。他越是努力，就越是沮丧。阿尔图斯甚至认为他能听到月亮的笑声映在潺潺的小溪和荡漾的池塘里，嘲笑他徒劳的努力。尽管如此，阿尔特斯仍然坚定不移。",
	"Tyton, intrigued, observed Altus as he struggled. \"Why do you persist in this task, my child?\" the Amaranthine of night asked. \"You must know you will not succeed.\"": "泰顿很感兴趣，在阿尔图斯挣扎时观察他。\"你为什么坚持这项任务，我的孩子？\"黑夜中的阿玛兰蒂恩问。\"你一定知道你不会成功。\"",
	"Altus replied, \"If I did not try, then I would never know for certain if I could. But you may be right. For all my strength, I can never best the moon, and only a fool refuses to acknowledge when he has been bested.\" Altus paused, letting out a sigh. \"Pity, it would have made a lovely gift for Ardea.\"": "阿尔图斯回答说：\"如果我不尝试，那么我就永远无法确定我是否能做到。但你可能是对的。以我所有的力量，我永远无法战胜月亮，只有傻瓜才会拒绝承认他被战胜了。\" 阿尔图斯停顿了一下，发出一声叹息。\"可惜了，这本可以成为送给阿迪雅的一份可爱的礼物。\"",
	"Tyton was touched, not just by the sentiment but by the incredible will of this birdfolk.": "泰顿被感动了，不仅仅是被这种情感所感动，也被这个鸟人的惊人意志所感动。",
	"\"Your resolve does you credit\" Tyton said. \"To capture the moon, you will require this.\" He said producing a lidded chalice, intricately carved from the wood of an alder tree. Tyton gave it to Altus, then the Amaranthine of night disappeared.": "\"你的决心为你赢得了荣誉。\"泰顿说。\"要捕获月亮，你需要这个。\" 他说着拿出一个有盖的圣杯，是用赤杨树的木头复杂地雕刻而成的。泰顿把它交给了阿尔图斯，然后黑夜中的阿马兰蒂恩消失了。",
	"Altus was puzzled, until the moon appeared from behind a cloud. He heard its laughter in the pond behind him. When he turned, he saw it: the moon's reflection set perfectly in the still, clear waters. Without delay, Altus filled the chalice with water. With the moon clearly reflected within the chalice, he quickly shut the lid. The moon was caught.": "阿尔图斯很疑惑，直到月亮从云层后面出现。他在身后的池塘里听到了它的笑声。当他转身时，他看到了：月亮的倒影完美地镶嵌在静止、清澈的水中。阿尔图斯毫不迟疑地将水注入了圣杯。月亮清晰地倒映在圣杯中，他迅速关上杯盖。月亮被抓住了。",
	"As dawn began to break over the horizon, Tyton appeared once again before Altus, \"Let my sister gaze upon my creation, but return it by day's end. The night has need of it,\" old Father Owl said, before departing for the lands beyond life.": "当黎明开始在地平线上破晓时，泰顿再次出现在阿尔图斯面前。\"让我的妹妹注视我的创造，但在白天结束前把它归还。夜晚需要它。\"老猫头鹰神父说，然后就离开了，前往生命之外的土地。",
	"And so it was that Altus presented Ardea with the moon. He became the first strig, and his people were gifted with his great strength and indomitable will. He kept his oath to Tyton, returning the moon that very evening. For this, Tyton gifted all strigs with the ability to see clearly under its light. Tyton welcomed Altus as a guest in his home, deep within the lands of death. Altus found the cold there bracing, and decided to share it with the people of Everden. This is why the weather is so inclement in winter; Altus returns each year, carrying storms of sleet and snow in his chalice, to test the birdfolk's endurance.": "就这样，阿尔图斯把月亮送给了阿尔迪亚。他成了第一个斯特里格人，他的人民得到了他强大的力量和不屈不挠的意志的恩赐。他遵守了对泰顿的誓言，当晚就把月亮还给了他。为此，泰顿赐予所有斯特里格人在月光下看得清楚的能力。泰顿欢迎阿尔图斯到他家做客，他家在死亡之地的深处。阿尔图斯发现那里的寒冷让人振奋，于是决定与埃弗登的人们分享它。这就是为什么冬天的天气如此恶劣；阿尔图斯每年都会回来，在他的酒杯里装着暴风雪，以测试鸟人的耐力。",
	"The last to present a worthy gift was Clhuran, who seemed an odd choice for a leader. Clhuran had no desire to lead.": "最后送上一份有价值的礼物的是克赫兰，他似乎是一个奇怪的领袖人选。克赫兰没有领导的欲望。",
	"He was whimsical and impulsive. He had wild moods, and was never able to focus on one task for too long. He also had incredible luck. Most saw him as little more than a bumbler, someone who floated their way through life. In truth, Clhuran was full of mirth and cunning. \"Where I am,\" he oft remarked, \"is simply where I am meant to be. I follow the flow of the universe.\"": "他异想天开，容易冲动。他有狂野的情绪，而且永远无法在一项任务上专注太久。他也有难以置信的运气。大多数人认为他不过是个混混，一个在生活中漂浮不定的人。事实上，克胡兰充满了欢笑和狡猾。\"他经常说：\"我所在的地方，只是我注定要去的地方。我跟随宇宙的流动。\"",
	"For all his mirth, Clhuran was notoriously fickle; he was a trickster, who delighted in humbling birdfolk who boasted about their cleverness. This earned him many admirers, and just as many enemies.": "克赫兰虽然爱笑，但却出了名的善变；他是个诡计多端的人，喜欢羞辱那些夸耀自己聪明的鸟人。这为他赢得了许多崇拜者，也赢得了同样多的敌人。",
	"Clhuran never intended to compete in the gift-giving contest.": "克赫兰从未想过要参加送礼比赛。",
	"\"What should I care what others think of me,\" he harrumphed, \"So long as I am happy?\" Some birdfolk, bitter at having been fooled by him, claimed Clhuran could never hope to win such a contest. Clhuran tried to pay them no heed, in his heart he felt the barbs hit their mark.": "\"我应该关心别人对我的看法，\"他哈哈大笑，\"只要我快乐就好。\" 一些鸟人因为被他愚弄而感到痛苦，声称克赫兰不可能希望赢得这样一场比赛。克赫兰试图不理会他们，在他的心里，他觉得这些刺耳的声音击中了他的目标。",
	"\"Who am I kidding,\" Clhuran sighed. \"I am not strong, nor smart, nor skilled, nor leaderly... I couldn't possibly produce a gift worthy of Ardea.\" With this last thought he sank into a bitter melancholy.": "\"我在骗谁呢？\"克赫兰叹了口气。\"我不强壮，也不聪明，没有技能，也没有领导能力......。我不可能创造出配得上Ardea的礼物。\" 带着这最后一个想法，他陷入了痛苦的忧郁之中。",
	"It was only when a young boy approached him that he regained his confidence. \"Please Clhuran, won't you show us what you can do?\" the small birdfolk said. \"Many of us love your tricks, and your jokes. You bring joy to all birdfolk! Surely if you try you can do it!\"": "只有当一个小男孩走近他时，他才恢复了信心。\"请问克胡兰，你不给我们看看你的本事吗？\"小鸟人说。\"我们很多人都喜欢你的把戏，还有你的笑话。你给所有鸟人带来了欢乐！\"。当然，如果你尝试，你可以做到！\"",
	"Clhuran saw the sincerity in the boy's eyes, and suddenly he knew what to do. \"Fine, fine,\" he exclaimed in mock annoyance. \"I suppose I shall entertain you.\"": "克赫兰看到男孩眼中的真诚，突然间他知道该怎么做。\"好吧，好吧，\"他假装恼怒地喊道。\"我想我应该招待你。\"",
	"With newfound confidence, he approached Ardea. All of the birdfolk were gathered, and when Clhuran looked upon the crowd he saw both enemies and friends. Thoughts of those friendships allowed Clhuran to reach deep within himself, and from the depths of his soul he felt a beat, like the Great Rhythm itself. Channeling this energy, Clhuran opened his beak and brought forth a most beautiful gift: a song.": "带着新的信心，他走近阿迪亚。所有的鸟人都聚集在一起，当Clhuran看着这群人时，他看到了敌人和朋友。对这些友谊的思考让克赫兰触及到了自己的内心深处，从他的灵魂深处，他感受到了一种节拍，就像伟大的节奏本身。利用这种能量，Clhuran张开嘴，带来了一份最美丽的礼物：一首歌。",
	"It was a song so perfect, so harmonious, that no birdfolk could deny its charm. Ardea beamed. \"My child, you have within you a rare gift. May all of your kin be blessed by it.\" With those words, Clhuran became the first luma, the Amaranthine of all fortune, good or ill. His peculiar connection to fate is shared by all his kin.": "这是一首如此完美、如此和谐的歌曲，没有鸟人可以否认它的魅力。阿迪雅笑了。\"我的孩子，你有一个罕见的天赋。愿你所有的亲属都能得到它的祝福。\" 有了这些话，克胡兰就成了第一个卢马，所有命运的阿玛兰斯因，无论好坏。他与命运的特殊联系为他所有的亲属所共享。",
	"Ever since Clhuran's performance all birds sing, hoping that they might imitate the perfect song he sang to Ardea. While some sing pleasantly, Clhuran made it so those who mocked him can only trill, shriek, or caw artlessly. This is why it is always important to show respect for others, no matter how odd they may seem.": "自从Clhuran的表演之后，所有的鸟儿都在唱歌，希望它们能模仿他唱给Ardea的完美歌曲。虽然有些人唱得很悦耳，但克赫兰让那些嘲笑他的人只能颤抖、尖叫或毫无艺术性地叫喊。这就是为什么对他人表示尊重总是很重要的原因，无论他们看起来多么古怪。",
	"\"O, seeing stars, hear my words and part the veil of night, Gift me thoughts of strategy, bless me with your sight. If this trial I do survive, with plans and actions shrewd, I pledge undying loyalty, for wisdom you imbued.\"": "\"哦，看到的星星，听到我的话语，拨开黑夜的面纱，赐予我策略的思想，用你的视力保佑我。如果我在这场考验中幸存下来，有了精明的计划和行动，我保证对你的忠心不渝，因为智慧是你赋予的。\"",

	"Humblewood is a great and ancient land covered by a vast temperate forest. In some places, this forest is so old the trees dwarf even the tallest castles. In other places, smaller trees provide food and shelter for the fauna and folk of the Wood. Humblewood is named after the forest, but beyond the trees exist the towering range of The Crest mountains, the low-lying swamplands of the Mokk Fields, and the rocky shores of the Talongrip Coast.": "汉伯伍德是一片伟大而古老的土地，被广阔的温带森林覆盖。在一些地方，这片森林是如此古老，树木甚至使最高的城堡都相形见绌。在其他地方，较小的树木为森林里的动物和居民提供食物和庇护。汉伯伍德是以森林命名的，但在树木之外，还有高耸的山峰，低洼的莫克场沼泽地，以及塔隆里普海岸的岩石海岸。",

	"Long ago, druids of the Wood learned how to speak with trees and use magic to shape them into shelters in which they could make their homes. This process was considered deeply respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape it didn't agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as shapers, became mediators between the will of the people and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood—Alderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart's branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart became Humblewood's capital. Known throughout the region as the \"Great Tree City,\" Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional and some from the farthest corners of Everden.": "很久以前，伍德的德鲁伊们学会了如何与树木对话，并使用魔法将它们塑造成可以安家的住所。这个过程被认为是非常尊重的，因为不能强迫树木采取它不同意的任何形状。因此，被称为塑造者的专业德鲁伊成为人们的意愿和森林的意愿之间的调解人。鸟人塑造者与森林中最高、最古老的树--桤木心对话。塑造者们获得许可，让鸟人在Alderheart的树枝上建造一个家。后来，这棵大树又允许把它的树干塑造成越来越多的人的家园。这座新兴的城市以这棵树的名字命名，这棵树如此慷慨地为森林里的人们提供了一个家，阿尔德心成为汉伯伍德的首都。在整个地区被称为 \"伟大的树城\"，Alderheart是一个充满活力的地方和文化中心，是成千上万居民的家，有些是地区性的，有些来自Everden的最远的角落。",
	"Alderheart is home to every race of birdfolk and humblefolk. The thriving community attracts people from faraway lands, like traveling merchants, explorers, and foreign dignitaries. Citizens of the Humblewood who don't live in the city routinely journey there to trade goods, stock up on supplies, engage in artistic endeavors, or simply to catch up on the latest news and gossip. Effectively everyone in Humblewood is connected to Alderheart.": "阿尔德心是每一个鸟人和卑微人种族的家园。这个繁荣的社区吸引着来自远方的人们，如旅行商人、探险家和外国政要。不住在城市里的拙政园公民经常去那里交易货物，储备物资，从事艺术工作，或者只是为了了解最新的新闻和八卦。实际上，汉伯伍德的每个人都与阿尔德心有联系。",
	"Virtually anything can be found in Alderheart, if you know where to look. The majority of the city's inhabitants are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark alleys and back rooms. Crime here is usually kept in check by the Perch Guard, but while the city guards are vaunted as being among the best in the Wood, illicit activities continue under the cover of darkness.": "几乎任何东西都可以在Alderheart找到，只要你知道去哪里找。这个城市的大多数居民都是善意的、正派的人，但像任何城市一样，也有黑暗的小巷和密室。这里的犯罪通常由珀奇卫队控制，但虽然城市卫队被吹嘘为森林中最好的卫队之一，但非法活动在黑暗的掩护下仍在继续。",
	"As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.": "由于Alderheart非常庞大，游客往往很难说他们是在一棵树上。伟大的树城分为三个主要层次，人们在这里生活、工作和进行他们的生活：树冠、树干和根部。",
	"The canopy contains Alderheart's most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.": "天幕包含了阿尔德心最有代表性的建筑，包括鸟人议会的会议厅，鲈鱼卫队的总部，以及森林中最大的市场。这个市场拥有精品店，顾客可以在这里找到高品质的武器、盔甲和冒险装备、最新的时装、最好的食物，以及从整个埃弗顿带来的商品。在主市场外，一些小商店则在小路之外兜售商品。虽然任何阿尔德心的社会名流都会建议你去那些更有名望的商店，但有些商店里的商品还是很便宜的。",
	"City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are moni-tored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy. \"Branchroads\", specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding platforms provide birdfolk, at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps. Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital becomes increasingly dangerous.": "位于树冠周围战略要点的城市大门，是进入城市的唯一认可方式，并由栖息地守卫哨所监控。这些城门与树的低层和森林地面相连，有大型蜿蜒的楼梯，可以步行。庞大的交通基础设施在树冠上很常见。\"支路\"，特殊形状的木制小路，是阿尔德心的贸易动脉。与绳索桥一起，这些道路允许快递员使用手推车将货物从一个地方运到另一个地方。连接到可升降平台的滑轮被用来将货物从森林地面上抬起。在最外围的树枝上，这些基础设施无法得到支持，滑翔平台至少为鸟人提供了一种穿越其他无法通行的缝隙的手段。如果没有滑翔的能力，在首都的这部分地区航行变得越来越危险。",
	"Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are stationed atop reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impres-sive homes are located in the Boughs District, just above the market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood and have a more modest feel to them.": "天幕中的建筑物由各种材料制成，包括石头、木材和砖。大多数都驻扎在加固的平台上，以保持其稳定性。更有价值的房屋位于枝桠区，就在市场的上方。那些在外围的树枝上的房子往往是由木头制成的，给人的感觉更加朴实。",
	"The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is stable floor beneath them.": "大都市最大的部分，即主干，它是繁荣的天幕和不太富裕的根部之间的一个中间地带。许多卑微的人在这里安家，因为他们下面有稳定的地板。",
	"The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers. Pathways split and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.": "对于新的旅行者来说，树干可能是阿尔德心最令人困惑和迷失方向的地方之一。小路分分合合，有时会渐渐消失得无影无踪。专门设计的冷灯笼系统作为主要路径的路标。这些灯笼使用捕获的萤火虫或魔法微粒来提供照明，这取决于附近的情况。在这两种情况下，点灯人的任务是确保它们在白天保持照明，以提供一个日/夜循环。",
	"In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart's wood. They showcase unique wares and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is home to inns, taverns, and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train new recruits to their order.": "在树干上，另一个市场也在蓬勃发展。在这里，各种类型的摊位都围绕着用阿尔德心的木头做成的中央支撑柱。它们展示着独特的商品和小众的民间风格的食品和文化产品，这在天幕市场是找不到的。也有一些好奇心强的商店和地区商品的卖家，如从年轻的罗勒鱼背上采摘的水晶。此外，树干市场是旅店、酒馆和公共房屋的所在地。对于那些想要节省钱财的人来说，这里是在阿尔德心找到可用商品和冒险装备的最好地方。在市场附近有一个德鲁伊的苔藓和真菌树林，由Tenders支持，他们帮助照顾树并训练新的新人加入他们的秩序。",
	"Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk market, the central support pillars contain tenement style housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out of the trunk, for Alderheart's traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since Alderheart was first shaped.": "除了树干市场上的许多商店和商品外，中央的支撑柱包含了为最国际化的树干居民提供的唐人街式住房。在这里也可以找到更多富裕的房屋，这些房屋是由树干塑造出来的，是为阿尔德心的传统思想的卑微的贵族以及鸟人贵族准备的，自从阿尔德心第一次被塑造出来，他们的家就在这里。",
	"Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind, illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood, most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that many cannot afford.": "过了树干市场，小路变宽，蜿蜒曲折，被树上的洞口照亮，阳光可以透进里面。尽管在这些明亮的空地上，有些房屋建在靠近树皮的地方，那里的窗户可以从木头上塑造出来，但大多数房屋都是在昏暗的小路上塑造的。少数人获得许可，在树干的外表面塑造房屋。这些特殊的房屋通过精心围起来的道路与内部通道相连，被认为是许多人买不起的奢侈品。",
	"The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are constantly on the lookout for smugglers.": "在树干上走得越远，住宅和基础设施就越破旧，越不整洁。没有官方授权的途径可以从树干的低处离开或进入树，而栖息地警卫队一直在寻找走私者。",
	"Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping, lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart: the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. These hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn't easy, but people are trying their best to keep their communities strong, as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the roots see it as necessary to survive.": "在树干的最低部分下面，有一系列的隧道被刻在阿尔德心的根部。起初，这些树根并不被认为是城市的正式部分，它们的发展在很大程度上被城市官员忽视了，直到有消息说那里发生了非法活动。许多人相信，如果德鲁伊能治愈这棵树，隧道就会消失，但阿尔德心本身对生活在这里的人很同情，决定允许隧道的存在，而不是强迫人们离开他们的家园。此后，根部隧道经过德鲁伊的塑造得到了加强，升至与树干内部相当，并在附近驻扎了一支鲈鱼卫队的驻军。即使有了这些改进，树根仍然是阿尔德心最贫穷的地区：大树城的贫民窟。在这里，空气总是阴暗潮湿，野生真菌肆意生长。建筑物大多是用捡来的材料拼凑起来的，有些已经被改造成了社区聚会场所。这些中心在主干区的帮助下帮助连接根部的社区，并允许这里的人们组织和计划邻里活动。根部地区的生活并不容易，但人们正在尽力保持他们的社区强大，因为他们为更好的生活条件向天幕请愿。这里的商店很少，一般都是贩卖走私和偷来的货物。犯罪是无处不在的；许多居住在树根的人认为这是生存所必需的。",

It is dangerous living so close to the Grove, but the rewards make it worth the risk for the intrepid folk that call Ashbarrow home. The town takes its name from the small hill upon which it rests, and is inhabited by a mix of birdfolk and humblefolk who shelter within its low stone walls. A large watchtower near the town's center serves as both a means of observing when the winds will bring ash from the Scorched Grove, as well as an observatory for seers who watch the stars for signs and portents.": "这个小镇位于焦土森林的边缘，风吹过的灰烬使土壤变得肥沃，土地上有丰富的野味。住在离丛林这么近的地方是很危险的，但对于把阿什巴罗当作家的无畏的人们来说，回报是值得冒险的。小镇的名字来自于它所处的小山丘，居住着一些鸟人和卑微的人，他们在低矮的石墙内避难。镇中心附近有一座大型瞭望塔，它既是观察风何时会从焦土林带来灰烬的手段，也是观察星星的预言家们的观察所。",

Prospective students are tested for their skills, but also the motivation for their studies. The College takes great care to ensure its members will positively represent the legacy and reputation of the Avium out in the world.": "Avium是一所魔法学院，有广泛的学科可供学习。知识的自由传播是Avium的核心原则之一，但学院仍然对它所保护的一些更危险的魔法书保持一定程度的保密性。Avium的大厅里欢迎所有的种族，尽管只有在校长和高级职员委员会的意愿下才会被录取。未来的学生要接受技能测试，但也要测试他们的学习动机。学院非常谨慎，以确保其成员将积极地代表Avium在世界的遗产和声誉。",
	"The Avium was once a living tree that was home to a perch known for producing some of Humblewood's most legendary scholars. After the tree's death, a group of wizards from this perch decided to found the Avium here. They used transmutation magic to artificially petrify the tree, and then shaped it into a building capable of housing the largest mage college in Humblewood. Controlled by magical fields, the College's many structures float in circuit with one another: a collection of towers, courtyards, and observatories all hover around the huge central building, each equipped with a bridge that lines up with the main building at regular intervals. Those not gifted with the birdfolk's limited form of flight must harness their magic for transportation, or wait until the archways align to allow for foot traffic.": "亚维姆曾经是一棵活生生的树，它是一个以培养汉伯伍德最富传奇色彩的学者而闻名的栖息地。在这棵树死后，一群来自这个栖息地的巫师决定在这里建立阿维姆。他们用转化魔法将这棵树人工石化，然后将其塑造成一座能够容纳汉伯伍德最大的法师学院的建筑。在魔力场的控制下，学院的许多结构都在彼此间循环浮动：一系列的塔楼、庭院和观测站都围绕着巨大的中央建筑盘旋，每个都配备了一座桥，以固定的间隔与主建筑连成一体。那些没有鸟人有限的飞行天赋的人，必须利用他们的魔法进行运输，或者等待拱门对齐，允许行人通行。",
	"While the curriculum is diverse, the College does impose certain limitations, most notably regarding necromancy. As inhabitants of the Wood, the Avium's primary staff members originate from a culture with great respect for nature and the cycle of life. As such, the necromantic arts are taught mainly in a theoretical sense. Practical application of necromancy at the College is highly regulated, and available only under strict guidance.": "虽然课程是多样化的，但学院确实施加了某些限制，最明显的是关于死灵法术。作为森林的居民，Avium的主要工作人员来自一种对自然和生命循环非常尊重的文化。因此，死灵术的教学主要是在理论上进行的。学院对死灵术的实际应用受到高度管制，只有在严格的指导下才能使用。",
	"Students are, however, encouraged to explore other schools of magic to their fullest potential. Breakthroughs in elemental theorems, teleportation methods, and advances in practical transmutation have been pioneered at the Avium. Within these classrooms you will find future Tenders, council members, and protectors of the Wood. The application process is demanding, and the curriculum rigorous. Few make it to graduation. For those who prove their grasp of the arcane, endorsement from the Avium is among the highest of honors.": "然而，学生们被鼓励去探索其他魔法流派的最大潜力。元素定理的突破，传送方法，以及实际转化的进展都是在阿维姆开创的。在这些教室里，你会发现未来的Tender、理事会成员和森林的保护者。申请的过程是苛刻的，课程是严格的。很少有人能顺利毕业。对于那些证明自己掌握了奥秘的人来说，来自奥维姆的认可是最高的荣誉之一。",

It includes a central hub of shops, trade halls, and shipping platforms, all under the watchful eye of the local Perch Guard. Some of the farms have even begun to expand downward, encompassing small horticultural plots at the base of trees. The grounded farms produce luxury goods that can't be grown along the branches, and house corrals for giant insects that produce goods ranging from silk to meat.": "在鸟人栖息地的耕作是非常规的。在较高的栖息地，树枝上长着果实累累的藤蔓和苔藓。最大和最有成效的养殖栖息地是布拉肯米尔（Brackenmill）。由于它靠近地面，被认为是一个较小的栖息地，但布拉克米尔由许多邻近的树木农场组成，经过多年的发展，彼此融合在一起。它包括一个由商店、贸易大厅和运输平台组成的中心枢纽，所有这些都在当地鲈鱼卫队的监视之下。一些农场甚至开始向下扩展，包括在树底的小块园艺地。地面上的农场生产无法在树枝上种植的奢侈品，并为生产从丝绸到肉类的巨大昆虫提供畜栏。",

Stranger still, the soil beneath the ashen steppes still smolders with embers. The air here carries a supernatural heat which can exhaust travelers or even cause burns depending on its fierceness. This hostile landscape is home to a variety of curious fire-aspected creatures. Certain species, now considered native to Humblewood, only appeared after the Great Calamity. Most notable are the emberbats, which roost in the safety of the Grove during the day.": "几个世纪前，被称为焦土森林的地区曾经是一片郁郁葱葱的森林，有平静的草地和宁静的小树林。然后，大灾难来了：一场巨大的森林火灾席卷了整个丛林，使其变成了一片燃烧的灰烬平原。丛林拒绝痊愈。更奇怪的是，灰烬草原下的土壤仍然在燃烧着余烬。这里的空气带着超自然的热量，可以使旅行者筋疲力尽，甚至造成灼伤，这取决于它的激烈程度。这种恶劣的地貌是各种好奇的火象生物的家园。某些物种，现在被认为是汉伯伍德的原生物种，只是在大灾难之后才出现。最值得注意的是琥珀蝙蝠，它们白天在安全的丛林中栖息。",
	"Accounts of the great blaze have been recorded in Humblewood's history books, but the exact cause of the Great Calamity remains a mystery. The soils of the Grove were tested and found to be distinctively suited to channeling evocation energy, especially when used with fire spells.

They believe that through study and communion with nature, the natural balance of the energy in the wood can be restored, healing the Grove back into the tranquil forest it once was.": "灼热丛林由神秘主义者和德鲁伊组成的小团体看管，他们被称为 \"补师\"。许多Tenders都是有天赋的思想家和自然魔法的实践者，他们毕生致力于了解灾难对丛林的影响的本质，并治愈它所造成的损害。他们相信，通过研究和与大自然的交流，可以恢复木材中能量的自然平衡，将丛林恢复到它曾经的宁静森林。",
	"There is much debate about the intent and success of the Tenders. High-society perch-dwellers are inclined to think of the Tenders as nothing more than \"odd-birds,\" embarking on a fool's errand. These detractors claim that the Scorched Grove is simply a quirk of Humblewood's natural magic. Much of the populace agrees with this point of view, despite educated claims to the contrary. Still, given the affinity between nature and the cultures of the Wood, Tenders are generally respected for the care and reverence they give to the forest.": "关于招标会的意图和成功，有很多争论。上流社会的栖息地居民倾向于认为投标人只不过是 \"怪鸟\"，是在做一件愚蠢的事情。这些诋毁者声称，焦土林只是汉伯伍德的自然魔法的一个怪癖。大部分民众同意这一观点，尽管有受过教育的人声称与此相反。尽管如此，考虑到自然和森林文化之间的亲和力，Tenders因其对森林的关怀和敬畏而受到普遍尊重。",

To this end, the perch was hastily constructed within a small stand of willow trees. In contrast to standard perches, a decent portion of the homes and facilities here were built entirely on the ground. This closeness to the earth creates a feeling of unease and general distaste for birdfolk accustomed to the high perches, but the other races that make up the population appreciate the easier access to research stations and support buildings.": "绞刑架是森林中一个相对较新的发展。它最初只是一个小的前哨站，是研究人员和前往莫克领域的粘液探查者的最后一站。当人们开始在沼泽中消失时，人们决定建造一个更永久的定居点，以容纳一小队鲈鱼卫士。为此，在一小片柳树丛中匆匆建造了栖息地。与标准的栖息地相比，这里的房屋和设施有相当一部分是完全建在地上的。这种与大地的亲近让习惯于高处栖息的鸟人感到不安和厌恶，但构成人口的其他种族很欣赏这种更容易进入研究站和支持建筑的方式。",

	"A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the \"being of fire and destruction\" said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood.": "这是一个传说中的生物，有些人认为这是 \"火与毁灭的存在\"，据说在许多世纪前引起了大灾难，创造了焦土森林。这方面拥有可怕的力量，足以对森林和所有居住在这里的人造成严重伤害。长久以来，人们已经忘记了这个生物是在一个失落的仪式中变出来的。此后不久，它被封存在焦土林下，它的存在一直影响着这个地区。几个世纪的休眠削弱了它，因为它的本质已经渗入周围的土地。自从被释放后，它开始通过消耗植物、树木和其他生物的火焰来为自己积累力量。一旦它获得足够的能量，完全打破束缚它的神秘枷锁，它将成为一股不可阻挡的力量，很有可能给整个汉伯伍德带来火热的毁灭。",
	"The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.": "最近发生的怪事让许多著名学者感到困惑：异常凶猛的微光蝙蝠、灰蛇的出现、森林火灾的频率增加，以及许多其他在汉伯伍德从未见过的现象。不仅仅是传说，该方面是所有这些的原因。作为原始火的生物，它与它的元素平面有着密不可分的联系。即使它在丛林下沉睡了几代人，它的存在还是引起了骚动，它的存在导致了将物质界与火界分开的屏障的减弱，使较弱的生物得以溜过。",
	"The aspect's essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove's nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.": "这方面的精髓也渗入了焦土林，使景观具有比以前更强的元素属性。丛林性质的根本转变有效地挫败了修行者的努力，他们长期以来一直在寻求治愈这片被烧毁的土地。随着这一方面的力量继续增长，更多这种有害的元素能量将被释放，甚至更强大的生物将从火焰中出现。如果这种异世界的力量不受控制地在森林中蔓延，整个汉伯伍德都可能遭受焦土森林的命运。",

	"Animated skeletons are common among the practitioners of the necromantic arts. Even at the Avium, where necromancy is forbidden in practice, it is taught in theory. A common exception is the use of animated skeletons for menial tasks around the college. The reanimation of birdfolk who did not give their express consent in life is seen as a violation of their memory, so these skeletons usually consist of former college staff who desired to stay and help long past their own time. Not all scholars agree that even this relatively benign form of necromancy should be allowed, while others don't see why permission from the dead should be necessary, believing that \"dead is dead\". Though the consent policy remains in place, heady debates over the ethics of certain forms of necromancy have resulted in the shunning of more morally flexible scholars.": "在死灵法术的修行者中，灵动的骷髅很常见。即使在Avium，死灵术在实践中是被禁止的，但在理论上却被教授。一个常见的例外是使用动画骷髅在学院周围做一些琐碎的工作。对生前没有明确同意的鸟人进行复活被认为是对他们记忆的侵犯，所以这些骷髅通常由前学院工作人员组成，他们希望在他们自己的时间过去很久后留下来帮忙。并非所有的学者都同意，即使是这种相对良性的亡灵魔法形式也应该被允许，而其他人不明白为什么要得到死者的许可，他们认为 \"死了就是死了\"。虽然同意政策仍然存在，但关于某些形式的死灵法术的道德问题的激烈辩论已经导致了对道德上更灵活的学者的回避。",

	"Cobblefrights are undead monstrosities created through dark necromancy. Rumored to have been orig-inally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night's Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus' research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.": "鹅卵石骑士是通过黑暗死灵法术创造的不死怪物。据传是由疯狂的死灵法师拉特鲁斯（Lathrus of the Night's Call）最初设计的，cobblefrights是通过将几个鸟人的骨架连接在一起，形成一个具有强化物理特性的可怕生物。在那些研究过拉赫鲁斯的研究的人中，只有最鲁莽的人才试图创造一个属于他们自己的鹅卵石恐惧症，但往往是灾难性的效果。",
	"Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them.": "鹅卵石骑士通常是由五到六个鸟人的骨架拼接而成的。多个身体的组合不仅允许更大、更坚固的设计，而且还大大增加了cobblefrights包含的死灵能量的数量。这种增加的能量为鹅卵石骑士提供了巨大的力量，相当于一打鸟人的总和。它也赋予了鹅卵石骑士的骨骼更强的耐久性。他们非凡的力量和复原力在某种程度上是一把双刃剑，因为鹅卵石骑士也需要大量的死灵能量来维持。现存的关于鹅卵石创造者的记录指出，非常出乎意料的是，这些生物发展出了消耗其他生物的生命力的能力，在这个过程中补充自己的能量。这使得鹅卵石骑士作为独立的哨兵非常有用，只要它们有稳定的生命体供应作为它们的燃料。",
	"The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.": "构成鹅卵石斗篷的不和谐部分对这些生物的身体产生了巨大的压力。这种压力的根源在于使鸟人的骨骼能够回忆起他们生前所知道的技能的相同魔法：骨骼记忆。灵魂的残余，如记忆、欲望、恐惧、技能和某些形式的知识，都被印在离世者的骨头上。当被死灵能量激活时，这些相互冲突的印象会在鹅卵石中混乱地旋转。由于鹅卵石骑士是由多个身体组成的，通常来自不同的时间、地点和生活方式，所以生物体内的印象特别不稳定和混乱。这种持续的内部冲突需要大量和定期的能量供应来保持鹅卵石的稳定，但它也赋予了它们惊人的抵抗力，可以抵抗那些试图从它们的创造者手中夺走对生物的控制权的人。然而，死灵法师必须小心翼翼地保持对这些危险生物的控制。受损的鹅卵石会轻易地收获它们的制造者，作为生命能量的直接来源。",

After a closer look, it seemed like the ground was glowing.": "莱雅身下的大地感觉异常温暖。她伸手去确认，马上痛苦地抽回手。她的羽毛被轻微烫伤。这个季节异常干燥，但这是一个令人恐惧的温度。仔细一看，似乎地面在发亮。",
	"CRACK! Leya's eyes went to the sound. The large tree she'd played in as a child had fallen, and smoke rose from its remains. \"Go!\" her mind yelled, and she listened, rushing towards home. \"Get to them before—\"": "咔嚓！咔嚓！咔嚓 Leya的眼睛向声音看去。她小时候玩过的那棵大树倒了，烟从它的残骸中升起。\"快走！\"她的脑海中大喊，她听了之后，急忙向家里跑去。\"赶在他们之前--\"",
	"Suddenly, flames burst forth, travelling at an unearthly velocity towards Leya's perch. Her perch meant the world to her, but in the vast expanse of the Wood it was small and unimportant. Too insignificant for a Perch Guard outpost of its own. Her heart tightened knowing the remote settlement wouldn't be warned in time, and that aid would not be close by.": "突然间，火焰迸发出来，以一种超乎寻常的速度向莱雅的栖息地飞去。她的栖息地对她来说意味着世界，但在广袤的森林中，它是渺小而不重要的。对于一个属于自己的栖息地守卫前哨来说，它太微不足道了。她知道这个偏远的定居点不会得到及时的警告，而且援助也不会在附近，所以她的心紧了起来。",
	"Leya's hands began to move without thought as she whispered the words of her grandmother. It wouldn't be enough, but she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she didn't try.

Droplets of a lost cause formed between her fingers.": "Leya的手开始不假思索地移动，她低声念叨着祖母的话。这还不够，但如果她不尝试，她就无法与自己相处。当初教给她的时候，这个咒语是为了帮助农场度过无雨的季节。它并不打算用于防御。她的手指间形成了一滴滴迷途的水珠。",
	"Conjured water fell to the ground, evaporating as soon as it hit the steaming forest floor. As she concentrated, a strong warm gust touched Leya's face. It's Altus, it must be! Leya thought.

She looked to the sky, frantically searching for more signs of changing weather.": "凝结的水落在地上，一落到蒸腾的森林地面上就蒸发了。当她集中精力时，一股强烈的暖风触及莱亚的脸。是阿尔图斯，一定是这样!

	"There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.": "在过去的几个月里，有一些令人不安的迹象，预示着汉伯伍德有问题。这些问题似乎源于焦土林的活动，这是一片灰暗的平原，许多世纪前被一场毁灭性的大火蹂躏过。不管是什么导致了这场大火，都给这片土地留下了元素魔法的伤痕，使得除了奇怪的火系生物之外，其他生物都无法生存。最近，丛林已经开始扩张。起初，人们很难注意到这种缓慢的扩张，但那些与自然相适应的人（尤其是Tenders）可以看到汉伯伍德的元素力量的不平衡。对于许多普通人来说，这种不平衡已经被体验为非季节性的干燥，这导致了农作物的歉收和森林火灾的频率增加。也有一些异常凶猛的安柏特云的报告，远远超出了它们的自然范围。",
	"The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|Humblewood} has stirred the elemental {@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood}, which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect's energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes.": "危险的真正性质仍然对森林里的人隐藏着。一个名叫{@creature Odwald Ebonhart|Humblewood}的科沃姆死灵法师搅动了元素{@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood}，自从焦土林第一次燃烧以来，它一直沉睡在地下。这方面的能量已经开始为森林中的火系生物提供能量。琥珀蝙蝠群的范围扩大，带来了扩大丛林的火灾。许多失去家园的森林居民为了生存而转而从事土匪活动。很快，元素的化身就会挣脱出来，玩家必须找到一种方法来阻止火的方面，以免它把森林变成灰烬。",

	"As you approach the three strangers who were gesturing at the body, you can see the pointed faces of mapach under the hoods. Two male and one female mapach, each wearing worn leather armor and a short sword on their belt. The fourth, an intimidating vulpin female, is lightly armored and wears an ornate sword on her hip. She seems to be hanging back, letting her subordinates do all the work.": "当你走近那三个对尸体做手势的陌生人时，你可以看到兜帽下的马帕奇的尖脸。两个男的和一个女的马帕奇，每个人都穿着破旧的皮甲，腰上系着一把短剑。第四位是一个令人生畏的瓦尔平族女性，身着轻甲，腰间佩带着一把华丽的剑。她似乎挂在后面，让她的部下做所有的工作。",
	"You hear a whimpered \"Help me\" from the creature laying on the road, but you can't make out their features. The mapach female, still standing near the fallen body, puts her hands on her hips and says to the party, \"All right folks, nothing to see. Move along if you know what's good for ya.\"": "你听到躺在路上的生物发出呜咽的 \"救命 \"声，但你无法看清他们的特征。仍然站在倒下的尸体附近的女性地图员，将双手放在臀部，对大家说：\"好了，伙计们，没什么好看的。如果你们知道什么对你们有好处的话，就赶紧走吧。\"",
	"The vulpin leading these three {@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood|mapach bandits} is a powerful foe named {@creature Fray Merridan|Humblewood}.

	"Assuming the party doesn't want to fight, the bandits will leave if bribed. They are reasonable robbers, and will gladly relinquish the cart if the party can offer a worthy sum. Negotiations start with Fray evaluating the cart's contents. She and her crew will simply walk away for 10 gp each. Players can roll opposed Charisma ({@skill Deception}) or ({@skill Persuasion}) checks against a Wisdom check made by Fray to negotiate for a lower price, but the bandits won't leave for anything less than 5 gp each.": "假设当事人不想打仗，如果被收买，这些强盗就会离开。他们是讲道理的强盗，如果党派能提供一笔有价值的钱，他们会很乐意放弃手推车。谈判开始时，弗雷评估了车上的物品。她和她的手下会为了每人10戈比而离开。玩家可以在弗雷所做的智慧检查的基础上，进行反对魅力（（%0%））或（（%1%）的检查，以争取更低的价格，但这些强盗不会因为每人少于5戈比而离开。",
	"Believing they have the upper hand, the bandits won't hesitate to attack if they sense trepidation or suspect that the party might be up to something. Any threats or posturing from the characters will be met with an attack from the three mapach bandits. This fight shouldn't be too difficult, as the party likely outnumbers the bandits and are probably better equipped.": "匪徒们认为他们占了上风，如果他们感到恐惧或怀疑党派可能有什么企图，就会毫不犹豫地进行攻击。角色们的任何威胁或姿态都会遭到三名马帕奇强盗的攻击。这场战斗应该不会太困难，因为队伍的人数可能超过土匪，而且装备可能更好。",
	"Fray will stay back and let the party fight the bandits for a round or two. She will intervene after two rounds or when a bandit is brought down. Fray will target the character who looks to be the most capable in single combat. If the party is larger than four players, she will engage in combat from the start, ordering her underlings to deal with the others.": "弗雷会呆在后面，让党派与强盗战斗一到两个回合。她会在两轮之后或当一个强盗被打倒时进行干预。弗雷的目标是看起来在单人战斗中最有能力的角色。如果队伍超过四个人，她将从一开始就参与战斗，命令她的下属对付其他人。",
	"Joining the fight, the bandit captain says, \"Intriguing. You look like you might actually give me a proper fight!\" The vulpin smirks and draws her blade, tracing intricate patterns in the air as she rushes into battle.": "加入战斗，强盗队长说：\"很有趣。你看起来可能真的会给我一个适当的战斗！\" 庸脂俗粉笑着抽出她的刀，在空中划出复杂的图案，她冲进了战斗。",
	"Fray is a deadly foe, but she wasn't prepared to have her heist interrupted. She won't risk her life needlessly if the odds turn against her. If at least two of the mapach bandits go down, she will make a tactical retreat into the dense forest, where she can easily disappear in the foliage. While escaping, she will swear revenge and leave any unfortunate underlings to the party's mercy.": "弗雷是一个致命的敌人，但她并没有准备好让她的抢劫行动被打断。如果胜算逆转，她不会无谓地拿自己的生命冒险。如果至少有两个马帕奇强盗倒下了，她会在战术上撤退到密林中，在那里她可以轻易地消失在树叶中。在逃跑的过程中，她会发誓要报仇，并将任何不幸的下属留给党的怜悯。",
	"The terrain is difficult for the party, but not for Fray, who is familiar with the area. Any character trying to pursue Fray on foot will quickly lose her in the forest unless they can make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check each round. The dense forest also makes gliding difficult. Most birdfolk can't glide through the trees, but Small birdfolk characters can attempt to glide after Fray, avoiding trunks and branches with a DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.": "这个地形对队伍来说很困难，但对熟悉这个地区的弗雷来说却不是。任何试图徒步追击弗雷的角色都会很快在森林中失去她，除非他们每回合都能进行DC 15智慧（（%0%））检查。茂密的森林也使滑翔变得困难。大多数鸟人不能在树上滑行，但小鸟人角色可以尝试在弗雷之后滑行，通过DC15的灵巧（（%1%））检查来避开树干和树枝。",
	"Failure on either the Wisdom or Dexterity check means the character has lost sight of Fray and ends the chase for that character. A character successfully chasing Fray through the woods means the party catches up with her, at which point she will surrender. If four rounds have passed since her retreat, the party has lost Fray.": "智慧或灵巧检查失败意味着该角色已经失去了弗雷的踪迹，并结束了对该角色的追逐。一个角色在树林中成功地追赶弗雷，意味着党派追上了她，这时她会投降。如果在她撤退后已经过了四个回合，那么队伍就失去了弗雷。",
	"Should the party choose to try and locate Fray by continuing down the road, they will arrive at a clearing where a river separates them from a dense forest on the other side.

	"If the encounter should go horribly awry, the bandits won't bother capturing the party or finishing them off. Rather, they will retreat, stealing as much from the hand-cart as they can carry.

The sword is not magical, but it will sell for double the normal going rate of a shortsword. Any lower level bandit who sees a character wearing the sword will immediately recognize it as a captain's sword. So long as the sword is visible, all bandits of a rank lower than captain will have disadvantage on any rolls made to oppose Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) ability checks made by that character.

	"After defeating or bribing the bandits, the characters can help the beaten figure lying in the road to her feet.

If the bats flew unnoticed until this point, they arrive so swiftly that the characters do not have time to prepare for the attack.": "如果云层的路线变化被注意到了，那么在蝙蝠降临到他们身上之前，角色们有大约10秒钟的时间。如果蝙蝠在这之前一直没有被注意到，它们会迅速到达，以至于角色们没有时间为攻击做准备。",

Certainly, they don't think the Council will just see just anyone, do they? Walden can write a letter of introduction to help the party get an audience, but he makes it clear he won't consider this until he is certain Kenna is safe. Should the party agree, Walden will express his gratitude, adding:": "如果当事人拒绝，治安官可以提出利用他的地位为当事人争取到奥尔德心的鸟人委员会的接见。当然，他们不认为委员会会随便见谁，对吗？沃顿可以写一封介绍信，帮助党派获得会面机会，但他明确表示，在确定肯娜安全之前，他不会考虑这个问题。如果当事人同意，沃顿会表示感谢，并补充说。",

	"The inside of the caverns are dark, damp, and dank. It is evident that the murky waters of the surrounding swamp have inundated the system of tunnels beneath.

The Mokkden Caverns are vast and largely uncharted.": "洞穴的内部是黑暗、潮湿和潮湿的。很明显，周围沼泽的阴暗水域已经淹没了下面的隧道系统。水从闪闪发光的天花板上滴下来，在整个洞穴里聚集成池，使地下充满了刺鼻的腐烂气味。隧道逐渐下降到地下，一边走一边轻轻地来回弯曲。莫克登岩洞非常广阔，基本上没有人知道。",
	"The cave interior is dimly lit at best, with most of the natural light provided by glowing fungi that grows in the humid environment.

	"The journey through the caverns can be made more difficult by incorporating difficult terrain. It can take the form of areas water-logged by the swamp seeping in or areas made slippery by dripping water and organic muck.

	"The closer entrance to the Mokkden Caverns juts out obviously from the surrounding mire. Be sure to roll on the {@table Swamp Encounters (Level 1)|Humblewood} table as the party approaches.

	"The slimes are ostensibly combat encounters, but any character can make a DC 12 {@skill Perception} check as they approach, easily spotting the slimes from 80 feet away on a success. On a failure the character does not notice the slimes until they are within 60 feet. If the party enters the range of the slime's {@sense blindsight} (60 feet), the slime will attack. If the party can spot the slimes before then, they can attempt to pick the slimes off with ranged weapons and spells (treat the slimes as though they are {@condition blinded} if they are attacked beyond their {@sense blindsight} radius).": "表面上看，这些史莱姆是在战斗中遇到的，但是任何角色在接近时都可以进行DC12（%0%）的检查，成功的话可以轻易地在80英尺外发现这些史莱姆。如果失败，该角色在60英尺内才会注意到史莱姆。如果队伍进入粘液的{@sense blindsight}(60英尺)范围，粘液就会攻击。如果一方在这之前能发现史莱姆，他们可以尝试用远程武器和法术将史莱姆挑走（如果史莱姆在其{@sense blindsight}半径之外受到攻击，则将其视为{@condition blinded}）。",
	"Other methods, such as luring the slimes away with a distraction, or using stealth to slip by unnoticed, can also work.

If at least half of the party members succeed, they make it by quietly.": "其他的方法，比如用分散注意力的方法引开粘液，或者用隐身术悄悄溜走，也是可以的。只要队伍没有误入粘液的{@sense blindsight}范围，队伍就可以通过DC14集体灵巧({@skill Stealth})检查成功来避免这两种遭遇。如果至少有一半的党员成功，他们就会悄悄地成功。",
	"Despite being dangerous, the slimes are slow and easy to outrun, so be sure to let the party know that they can make a break for the entrance if they're spotted. The slimes will give up the chase a few rounds after the party moves outside of their {@sense blindsight} range.": "尽管史莱姆很危险，但它们的速度很慢，很容易跑掉，所以一定要让队伍知道，如果它们被发现了，可以从入口处逃走。在队伍离开它们的（%0%）范围后，史莱姆会放弃追赶。",

	"After a moment of trepidation, a {@creature lesser demon|Humblewood} climbs out of the cauldron, spilling the ritual mixture everywhere. Susan begins to ask the demon a flurry of questions.

	"Susan is grateful for your help in dispatching the demon. She admits she may have been a bit too ambitious with her summoning, and will adjust her future rituals accordingly.

	"This part of the adventure introduces one of the greatest forces threatening the Wood: the Bandit Coalition, which has risen up and gained power since the fires first began to spread. The Coalition's membership is comprised mostly of humblefolk who, because of the fires, have been displaced from small villages deep in the Wood. Their homes are generally less fortified than the birdfolk perches, and while humblefolk refugees have sought shelter within Alderheart, many were refused entry due to overcrowding, and have turned to a life of banditry to sustain themselves.": "冒险的这一部分介绍了威胁森林的最大力量之一：强盗联盟，自从大火开始蔓延以来，该联盟已经崛起并获得了权力。联盟的成员主要由卑微的人组成，他们因为大火而从森林深处的小村庄流离失所。他们的家园通常没有鸟人栖息地那么坚固，虽然卑微的难民在阿尔德心寻求庇护，但由于过度拥挤，许多人被拒绝进入，并转向强盗的生活来维持自己。",
	"The Coalition now represents a serious threat to the Wood, owing to the leadership of a scarred cervan warrior named {@creature Benna Seridan|Humblewood}. Benna's mission is one of revenge against the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart, but she also seeks to support all the forest-dwellers who were displaced by the fires, many of whom now serve in the Coalition. The party must defend Alderheart from the Bandit Coalition, and will later be asked by the Council to help strike a decisive blow against the bandit menace.": "由于一个名叫{@creature Benna Seridan|Humblewood}的伤痕累累的塞万族战士的领导，联盟现在对森林构成了严重威胁。本娜的任务是对阿尔德心的鸟人议会进行报复，但她也试图支持所有因火灾而流离失所的森林居民，其中许多人现在在联盟中服务。他们必须从强盗联盟手中保卫阿尔德心，后来理事会还要求他们帮助对强盗的威胁进行决定性的打击。",
	"After their trials at Winnowing Reach, characters will continue to make their way toward Alderheart to seek an audience with the Birdfolk Council, possibly with Eliza in tow. The road to the capital is long, requiring three days of travel. Be sure to have Eliza or another NPC from Winnowing Reach remind the party to properly stock up before they depart. They can find any supplies they might need for their journey (rations, bedrolls, and the like) at the local general store.": "在温诺因河畔的试炼结束后，角色们将继续向奥尔德心（Alderheart）进发，以寻求与鸟人议会的会面，可能还有伊丽莎的陪伴。去首都的路很漫长，需要三天的时间。一定要让伊莱扎或其他来自温诺伊奇的NPC提醒他们在出发前适当地储备物资。他们可以在当地的杂货店找到旅途中可能需要的任何物资（口粮、铺盖等）。",

	"Lately, the number of folks residing in the trunk section has swelled due to villagers escaping the fires.

	"This part of the trunk is known for a series of holes within the bark that allow natural light to stream in.

	"If the party helped Eliza along her journey she will remember their kindness and offer them a 10% discount on purchases, and an extra 10% when selling to her.

	"Typical fantasy races (elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs and the like) aren't native to the world of Everden, but instead of keeping magic items that reference these races out of your campaign, it is recommended that you find a way to incorporate them in ways that fit with the races available in the Humblewood setting.

These things do happen, you know.\"": "\"阿什巴罗已经被烧成灰烬？你不说！\" 县长一边抚摸着下巴一边低头看他的文件。\"现在，这很重要。不幸的是，我被我的办公室所约束，要做到公平，所以你的消息将不得不等待，就像其他人一样。我建议你们把自己弄得舒服些，享受这个城市的辉煌。\" 短暂停顿后，格雷戈尔抬起头，继续说：\"但是，如果你有兴趣，并愿意听我说完，我可能会'意外地'在其他人之前提交你的请求。这些事情确实发生了，你知道。\"",
	"If the party agrees to help, the Magistrate will tell them about a group of jerbeens that have been causing trouble around the trunk's market district. People down there have been filing complaints, and he would like to see the matter dealt with. Supposing the party can ensure Gregor never has to hear about this problem again, he'll grant them an early audience with the Council.": "如果当事人同意帮忙，县长会告诉他们，有一伙人在树干的市场区周围制造麻烦的jerbeens。那里的人们一直在投诉，他希望看到这件事得到处理。如果他们能确保格雷戈尔永远不会再听到这个问题，他就会让他们提前与议会会面。",
	"You can have the party come up with their own solution for finding the jerbeens, but if they're stuck, advise them that asking around the market might be an easy way to locate them. Inquiring around the market will require a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, which will lead the party straight to the jerbeen hideout on a success. A failure will require another hour of searching before coming across someone who knows where the hideout is.": "你可以让他们自己想办法找到杰比恩，但是如果他们被困住了，建议他们在市场上打听一下，可能是找到他们的一个简单方法。在市场上打听需要进行DC13智力（（%0%））检查，如果成功，就能直接找到杰比恩的藏身之处。如果失败，则需要再找一个小时，才能找到知道藏身之处的人。",
	"There are four jerbeens, all of them siblings. Their parents died when their village was consumed by a forest fire, and they've been stealing to survive ever since. The eldest uses the stat block for a {@creature jerbeen thief|Humblewood}. The other three, being far less skilled, use the stat block for a {@creature bandit}, but halve the bandit's hit points (add jerbeen traits to these NPCs if desired). They are all armed with {@item dagger|phb|daggers} and {@item sling|phb|slings}.": "有四个杰宾，他们都是兄弟姐妹。他们的父母在他们的村庄被森林大火吞噬时去世了，从那时起他们就一直在偷窃生存。最年长的那个人用状态块做了一个（%0%）。其他三个人，由于技术较差，使用状态块为{@creature bandit}，但将强盗的命中率减半（如果需要的话，给这些NPC添加Jerbeen特征）。他们的武器都是（%2%）和（%3%）。",
	"The party can attempt to persuade the thieves to stop stealing and find another means to support themselves. A DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check will convince them their current lifestyle is too dangerous, but it won't solve their problems. Have the characters roleplay to find a solution. Any character with a background that grants them connections to a temple, business, or other such institutions in the city could likely help the jerbeen orphans secure work.": "队伍可以尝试劝说这些盗贼停止偷窃，并找到另一种方法来支持自己。通过DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查可以说服他们目前的生活方式太危险了，但这并不能解决他们的问题。让角色们通过角色扮演来找到解决方案。任何有背景的人物，如果能与城市中的寺庙、企业或其他类似机构建立联系，就有可能帮助杰比恩孤儿获得工作。",
	"The party can give the young thieves some gold, solving their financial problems temporarily. Any amount of gold will help them for a time: five gold pieces will provide the siblings enough security to look for honest work, while a payment of one gold piece could result in the jerbeens resorting to stealing again, once the gold runs out. In the latter situation, the characters may cross paths with the Magistrate later, at which point he will report that \"The thieves are at it again!\"": "党可以给这些年轻的小偷一些金子，暂时解决他们的经济问题。任何数量的金子都可以帮助他们一段时间：5个金子可以为兄妹俩提供足够的安全感，让他们寻找诚实的工作，而一旦金子用完，一个金子的支付可能导致Jerbeens再次诉诸于偷窃。在后一种情况下，人物可能会在稍后与县长交手，届时他将报告说：\"盗贼又来了！\"",
	"The orphans can also simply be fought. If one or more of them are reduced to 0 hit points, the rest will flee. This humbling experience could result in them aligning with the bandits to survive. The Magistrate may never hear from the orphans again, but the party might meet the jerbeen orphans again during an encounter with bandits.": "孤儿们也可以简单地进行战斗。如果他们中的一个或多个被降低到0命中率，其余的就会逃跑。这种卑微的经历可能会导致他们为了生存而与土匪结盟。县长可能再也听不到这些孤儿的消息了，但在与强盗的交锋中，队伍可能会再次遇到这些被抛弃的孤儿。",
	"Whatever the party decides to do, after confirming the player's actions through some of his connections in the city, the Magistrate will tell the party they can expect to have their audience granted the following day.": "无论当事人决定做什么，在通过他在城里的一些关系确认了玩家的行动后，行政官会告诉当事人，他们可以期待在第二天获得觐见。",
	"The guard to your left roughly grabs the paperwork. \"Let me see that.\" After giving the scroll a very thorough readthrough, the guard moves to the side, stiffens his back, and gestures towards the door. \"Everything is in order here. Please join the other petitioners waiting to be summoned.\"": "你左边的警卫粗暴地抓住了文件。\"让我看看。\" 在对卷宗进行了非常彻底的阅读后，警卫移到一边，挺起腰杆，向门外打手势。\"这里一切都很正常。请加入其他等待传唤的请愿者。\"",
	"After waiting for what feels like an eternity, another guard loudly calls your names and instructs you to enter the chambers.": "在等待的过程中，感觉像是过了很久，另一名警卫大声叫着你们的名字，指示你们进入房间。",
	"As you pass through the double doors into the Council Chambers, you see a group of five stately birdfolk arranged across elevated seats. Each council member has a tall podium in front of them, rising to just above their waist. A sheaf of papers is ordered neatly upon each podium. A circular aperture in the center of the ceiling allows sunlight to shine in. A wise-looking bright gallus raises a talon in greeting and addresses your party: \"You now stand in the presence of the Birdfolk Council. I am the Council's Speaker, Bita. Please, state your case.\"": "当你通过双门进入议事厅时，你看到一群五位庄严的鸟人排列在高高的座位上。每个理事会成员面前都有一个高高的讲台，升到他们的腰部以上。每个讲台上都整齐地摆放着一叠文件。天花板中央的一个圆形孔洞让阳光照射进来。一个聪明的明亮的gallus举起一只爪子打招呼，向你们一行人讲话。\"你们现在站在鸟人议会的面前。我是议会的发言人，比塔。请陈述你们的情况。\"",
	"Overseen by {@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|Humblewood}, the Council is the ruling body of Humblewood. The Council has the authority to draft laws that affect the entire Wood.": "在{@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|Humblewood}的监督下，理事会是Humblewood的统治机构。理事会有权起草影响整个森林的法律。",
	"The members of the Council will gladly hear the party out. Despite the dignity and formality with which they hold themselves, each Council member cares deeply for the people of the Wood. They will listen carefully to the woes Meadowfen is facing, and will be saddened to hear of Ashbarrow's destruction. If there are any other issues the party wishes to recount to the Council, they will hear these as well.": "理事会的成员会很乐意听党的意见。尽管他们有自己的尊严和形式，但每个理事会成员都深深地关心着森林里的人们。他们会仔细聆听Meadowfen所面临的困境，并对Ashbarrow的毁灭感到悲哀。如果有任何其他问题，党派希望向议会叙述，他们也会听取这些问题。",
	"Use this pool of information to inform the Council's behavior:": "利用这个信息库为安理会的行为提供信息。",
	"The Council is aware of the spreading fires, but their primary concern is banditry jeopardizing the big city and essential trading hubs. The bandit ranks have swelled of late, and the Perch Guard can only be spread so thin.": "议会知道火势的蔓延，但他们最关心的是危及大城市和重要贸易中心的土匪行为。盗贼的队伍近来不断膨胀，而鲈鱼卫队的兵力只能如此分散。",
	"The bandits have been rallied by a fearsome leader, making them bolder than ever. Little is known about this leader, but the Council has been able to corroborate that she is a ruthless cervan female, named Benna Seridan, who holds a great hatred for Alderheart.": "匪徒们被一个可怕的领袖召集起来，使他们比以前更大胆。人们对这个领袖知之甚少，但理事会已经能够证实她是一个冷酷无情的女塞万人，名叫本娜-塞里丹，对阿尔德心怀有极大的仇恨。",
	"The Council knows that Alderheart could support more refugees, but they prefer to remain cautious in these difficult times. The fires keep spreading, after all. If all the refugees are allowed to enter, how long before the city runs out of food and other essential resources?": "议会知道Alderheart可以支持更多的难民，但他们更愿意在这些困难时期保持谨慎。毕竟，大火一直在蔓延。如果所有的难民都被允许进入，那么在这个城市的食物和其他基本资源耗尽之前，还有多久？",
	"The Council can decide to confer among themselves and meet with the party again tomorrow afternoon, to see what aid they can afford to send to Meadowfen. They assure the party that aid will be sent, but ask for their patience during these trying times. Sending a cart of supplies along bandit-ridden roads will not be easy, and any guards they send as an escort will mean less protection for the Alderites.": "议会可以决定在他们之间进行商议，并在明天下午再次与该党会面，看看他们有能力向Meadowfen发送什么援助。他们向当事人保证，会送去援助，但请他们在这艰难的时刻保持耐心。沿着强盗横行的道路运送一车物资并不容易，而且他们派出的任何护卫都意味着对阿尔德里特人的保护会减少。",
	"After the meeting with the Birdfolk Council, in the middle of the night, the following happens:": "在与鸟人委员会的会议之后，在半夜，发生了以下情况。",
	"A city-wide alarm sounds, rousing the Perch Guard to their posts. Following the commotion, you see a great deal of movement around the northern entrance to Alderheart. There are shouts of \"Bandits!\" all around, and something about a merchant caravan arriving at the city.": "全城的警报声响起，唤起了栖息地守卫队，让他们各就各位。伴随着骚动，你看到奥尔德心城的北部入口处有大量的运动。到处都是 \"强盗！\"的喊声，还有一些关于商队抵达城市的消息。",
	"{@b {@i If the party decides to check out the scene,}} they will arrive at a platform in front of the northernmost city gate.

If the characters are armed or wearing armor, the guard captain will beseech them to help repel the bandits.": "{@b {@i If the party decides to check out the scene,}}他们将到达最北边的城门前的一个平台。在那里，他们将面临一个令人沮丧的场景：几辆马车正被一支庞大的强盗部队围困。如果人物有武器或穿着盔甲，警卫队长会恳求他们帮助击退土匪。",
	"Below, a handful of bandit captains are barking orders at dozens of bandits attacking the caravans. Though the party may want to leap right into the fray, be sure to emphasize the danger involved. While ranged combat might help provide support for the sparse Perch Guard infantry, any character that throws themselves into the melee will soon be overwhelmed.": "下面，几名强盗队长正在对攻击商队的几十名强盗发号施令。虽然队伍可能想直接跳入战场，但一定要强调其中的危险。虽然远程战斗可能有助于为稀少的鲈鱼护卫队步兵提供支持，但任何投身于近战的角色都会很快被淹没。",
	"There are many ways characters could provide support for the sparse Perch Guard infantry. Examples include rallying the scattered Perch Guard with a heartening display, or cutting the ropes on the pulley system or freight elevators to create makeshift cover for Alderheart's forces to crouch behind. Encourage players to come up with their own creative solutions.": "有很多方法可以让角色为稀少的鲈鱼卫队步兵提供支持。例如，用振奋人心的表演来召集分散的栖息地卫队，或者切断滑轮系统或货运电梯上的绳索，为Alderheart的部队创造临时的掩护，让他们蹲在后面。鼓励玩家想出他们自己的创造性解决方案。",
	"After two or three party members have helped stem the assault, the brigands will start to flee, spilling armfuls of plundered treasure as they escape. At this point, the bandit horde will be small enough that the Perch Guard can go on the offensive, and characters can attempt to enter melee combat. If they do, have them encounter a {@creature vulpin captain|Humblewood}, still trying to keep the bandit forces organized. A one-on-one fight with a character might be appropriate, but if the whole party joins in, add two {@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood|mapach bandits} or a single {@creature jerbeen thief|Humblewood}. The downfall of these foes marks the complete rout of the bandit forces.": "在两到三名党员帮助阻止攻击后，强盗们会开始逃跑，在逃跑时洒下一臂的掠夺来的财宝。这时，强盗群的规模将足够小，鲈鱼护卫队可以展开攻势，人物可以尝试进入近战。如果他们这样做，让他们遇到一个（%0%），仍然要努力保持强盗部队的组织。与一个角色进行一对一的战斗可能是合适的，但如果整个党派都加入进来，就增加两个（%1%）或一个（%2%）。这些敌人的倒下标志着强盗部队的彻底溃败。",

	"Spears, arrows, and even rocks thrown from slings rain down upon the bandit horde. Laden with the spoils of their raid, the bandits struggle to fight and begin to retreat. A victorious cry goes up along the wall, but the captain of the Perch Guard gazes down at the razed and ramshackled caravan with a look of steely determination. \"We have wounded down there,\" she exclaims, rallying the troops. \"Send for healers!\"": "矛、箭，甚至从吊索上扔下的石块都落到了土匪群中。匪徒们满载着突袭的战利品，挣扎着开始退却。城墙上响起了胜利的呼声，但栖霞卫队的队长却用一种坚定的眼神注视着被夷为平地的、带着羊角的商队。\"我们下面有伤员，\"她喊道，召集部队。\"请派医护人员来！\"",
	"The bandits have taken all they can carry and fled into the northern forest. The scene left in their wake is one of broken merchant carts and wounded people. Birdfolk and humblefolk alike are injured and frightened.

A character who can provide medical aid with skills, tools, or spells may also do so.": "匪徒们带走了他们能携带的所有东西，逃进了北部森林。他们身后留下的场景是破碎的商车和受伤的人。鸟人和卑贱的人都受伤了，而且很害怕。角色可以加入救援工作，帮助把受伤的人抬到树上进行治疗，或者协助受惊的旅行者到安全的树冠上。一个能用技能、工具或法术提供医疗援助的角色也可以这样做。",

	"A variety of gold and silver plated urns, plates, and utensils, with a combined value of 200 gp.": "各种镀金和镀银的骨灰盒、盘子和器皿，总价值为200克朗。",
	"Leaving the traces of battle behind, the remainder of the Perch Guard and militia return to Alderheart. Honoring their sacrifice, the fallen are transported at the front of the somber parade back to the city. Those who cannot carry themselves are carried on makeshift stretchers while the injured are helped along the trail home. Despite heavy losses, you and your companions are welcomed back to Alderheart as heroes.": "抛开战斗的痕迹，剩下的佩奇卫队和民兵们回到了阿尔德心。为了纪念他们的牺牲，阵亡者被送到了回城游行队伍的最前面。那些不能自己携带的人被放在临时的担架上，而受伤的人则被搀扶着沿着小路回家。尽管损失惨重，你和你的同伴们还是作为英雄被欢迎回到阿尔德心。",
	"Upon returning to Alderheart, the party is summoned to an emergency meeting of the Birdfolk Council. The Captain of the Perch Guard commends the party for their bravery and skill, but the Council urgently demands to hear about the bandits. The Council asks many questions about the bandits: their numbers, their tactics, which way they fled, and how many were injured. It is clear the Council fears reinforcements may be nearby.": "回到Alderheart后，队伍被召集到鸟人理事会的紧急会议上。鲈鱼护卫队队长赞扬了队伍的勇敢和技巧，但议会迫切要求了解土匪的情况。议会问了很多关于强盗的问题：他们的人数、他们的战术、他们往哪边逃，以及有多少人受伤。很明显，议会担心援军可能就在附近。",
	"One Council member asks if any personal items were found at the camp, explaining that over the past few months goods and possessions have gone missing. Should the party be honest about what they found in the camp, they will be allowed to keep any recovered magical items for their effort, as well as half of the value of treasure they recovered from the bandit camp.": "一位理事会成员询问是否在营地发现了任何个人物品，并解释说在过去的几个月里，货物和财产都丢失了。如果这一行人诚实地说出他们在营地里发现的东西，他们将被允许保留任何找回的魔法物品，作为他们的努力，以及他们从强盗营地找回的宝物价值的一半。",
	"It is also an option to keep their treasure a secret, requiring a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. On a success, the party is taken at their word. On a failure, the Council member who posed the question distrusts them, but the rest of the Council will side with the party in this dispute, at least for now.": "也可以选择对他们的财宝保密，需要进行DC15魅力（（%0%））检查。如果成功，他们就会相信自己的话。如果失败，提出问题的委员会成员就会不信任他们，但委员会的其他成员会在这场争论中支持他们，至少目前是这样。",
	"The Birdfolk Council, not knowing the location of the bandit's hoard, will conduct an inquiry in the coming days.": "鸟人委员会不知道强盗囤积的地点，将在未来几天进行调查。",
	"If using milestone rules for experience, each character should now reach level 3.": "如果使用里程碑式的经验规则，每个角色现在应该达到3级。",
	"With the bandits dealt with for now, life quiets down a bit around Alderheart. This is a good opportunity for the characters to further explore the city and resolve plot threads or character hooks.": "暂时解决了土匪的问题，阿尔德心的生活稍微平静了一些。这是一个很好的机会，可以让人物进一步探索这个城市，并解决情节线索或人物钩子。",
	"The razing of the bandit camp was a huge blow to the morale of the Bandit Coalition, and should the party wander around the city, the Alderites will make them feel that their actions have had an enormous impact. Roughly a week's downtime is reasonable. Shorten or extend the quiet period depending on side quests. As soon as the party seems ready, skip to {@adventure Council Summons|hwcs|2|Council Summons}.": "夷平强盗营地对强盗联盟的士气是一个巨大的打击，如果一行人在城市里闲逛，阿尔德里特人会让他们觉得他们的行动产生了巨大的影响。大致一周的安静期是合理的。缩短或延长静默期，这取决于副线任务。一旦队伍看起来准备好了，就跳到（%0%）。",
	"If any of the party members are curious or would like to pursue leads on the bandit threat, they will find out that Fray (if she is still alive) and any bandits the militia rounded up are being held in the Alderheart gaol.": "如果有党员感到好奇，或者想追查有关土匪威胁的线索，他们会发现弗雷（如果她还活着）和民兵围捕的任何土匪都被关押在阿尔德心监狱。",
	"At the gaol, the characters may question Fray or another bandit to persuade them to reveal the location of the bandit's mountain stronghold. The interviewee is initially tight-lipped, but if either goaded with a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check or bluffed with a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check, they will reveal the stronghold's exact location in the Crest. Sometimes there is more than one way to open a lock, and the players may be able to find other avenues to acquire this information. Either way, the captive's position is simple:": "在监狱里，人物可以询问弗雷或另一个强盗，说服他们说出强盗的山地据点的位置。受访者起初口风很紧，但如果用DC14魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）检查来诱导，或者用DC14魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查来吓唬，他们就会透露山寨的确切位置。有时，打开锁的方法不止一种，玩家可能会找到其他途径来获取这些信息。无论怎样，俘虏的位置很简单。",

	"Once the Birdfolk Council learns that the location of the bandit stronghold has been revealed, it won't take them long to summon the party and ask for their assistance in dealing with the stronghold once and for all. Hopefully, action can be taken before the bandits can unleash whatever they're planning for Alderheart.": "一旦鸟人委员会得知强盗据点的位置被揭露，他们不会花很长时间来召唤党，并要求他们协助彻底解决这个据点的问题。希望能在强盗们为阿尔德伍德心计划的东西释放出来之前采取行动。",
	"Should the party want to seek the Ash-Knight out, Riffin can be found at the Wooden Flagon. The Wooden Flagon is a tavern near the trunk's market district where Riffin has been staying. It won't be too hard to locate him, especially if the party speaks with any of the guards, militia, or birdfolk who fought in the assault on the bandit camp. Riffin's gallant efforts against the bandits have made him the talk of the town, and he has had many visitors since the victory.": "如果队伍想要寻找灰烬骑士，可以在木制酒壶找到瑞芬。木制酒壶 \"是一家靠近树干市场区的酒馆，瑞芬一直呆在那里。要找到他并不难，特别是如果党派与任何在袭击强盗营地时战斗过的卫兵、民兵或鸟人交谈。瑞芬对强盗的英勇努力使他成为镇上的话题，胜利后他有很多访客。",
	"You see before you a small yet sturdy looking strig clad head to talon in heavy armor, sitting at the bar with a flagon of ale.

	"Riffin is friendly, and will gladly share his story. He is from Ashbarrow and was only able to escape the recent destruction of his village thanks to the help of his good friend {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|Humblewood}, who brought him here. Riffin and Odwald have been adventuring buddies for a long time. The morning before the bandits raided the merchant caravan outside Alderheart's gates, Riffin awoke to find Odwald gone without a word. He was looking for his friend when the violence began, but he couldn't stand idly by while bandits attacked the city. Now that he's confirmed Odwald is no longer in Alderheart, Riffin is preparing to leave on a journey to find Odwald. He has some idea of where the old bird might've gone.": "瑞芬很友好，并且很乐意分享他的故事。他来自阿什巴罗（Ashbarrow），由于他的好朋友（%0%）的帮助，他才得以逃离最近被摧毁的村庄，并被带到了这里。瑞芬和奥德瓦尔德是很久以前的冒险伙伴了。在强盗们突袭阿尔德心城门外的商队的前一天早上，瑞芬醒来时发现奥德瓦尔德一声不吭地走了。暴力事件开始时，他正在寻找他的朋友，但他不能对强盗们袭击城市的行为袖手旁观。现在他已经确认奥德伍德不再在奥德心，Riffin准备离开，踏上寻找奥德伍德的旅程。他对那只老鸟可能去的地方有了一些了解。",
	"\"I owe Odwald, even if he might not accept it. Maybe it's strange, but I just know he's got himself into ‘sumthin'. He needs my help. What sorta friend would I be if I abandoned him?\"": "\"我欠奥德瓦尔德的，即使他可能不接受。也许这很奇怪，但我知道他把自己卷进了什么事。他需要我的帮助。如果我抛弃了他，我还算什么朋友？\"",
	"Riffin will politely decline any requests from the party asking for his help in dealing with the bandits. His duty now is to his friend. If the party offers to help Riffin look for Odwald, the strig will thank them kindly, but insist that both as a knight and a friend it is his duty alone to pursue this. He knows Odwald well, and Riffin is certain he'll find his friend at one of their old haunts.": "瑞芬将礼貌地拒绝任何要求他帮助对付土匪的请求。他现在的职责是对他的朋友负责。如果党派提出帮助Riffin寻找Odwald，他将善意地感谢他们，但坚持认为作为一个骑士和一个朋友，只有他才有责任去寻找这个。他很了解奥德瓦尔德，瑞芬确信他会在他们的某个老地方找到他的朋友。",
	"As the party leaves the tavern, Riffin will wish them luck on their travels. If the party tries to locate Riffin once they get back from the stronghold, they'll find he has already left the city.": "当队伍离开酒馆时，瑞芬会祝他们旅途顺利。如果队伍从据点回来后试图找到瑞芬，他们会发现他已经离开了城市。",
	"If the party was unsuccessful at holding an audience with the Birdfolk Council and relaying Ardwyn's message, the party may relay that message at this meeting with the Birdfolk Council (see {@adventure Audience with the Council|hwcs|2|Audience with the Council}).": "如果该党在与鸟人议会举行会谈并转达阿德温的信息时没有成功，该党可以在这次与鸟人议会的会谈中转达该信息（见（%0%））。",
	"To guarantee the characters meet with the Alderheart Birdfolk Council, have a messenger or guard present them with an immediate summons to the Council Chambers.

	"Having fled after the defeat at their forest camp, many bandits have returned to their stronghold in the Crest. This fortress is capable of withstanding a large-scale attack, and its position in the mountains makes it a dangerous location to assault. The Council has seen fit to ask the adventurers to flush out the bandit leadership once and for all, finally ridding Humblewood of their thievery and brutality. Given a major encounter would prove disastrous, the Council calls on the heroes to use their proven skills to infiltrate the fortress and dispatch the leader of the Bandit Coalition: Benna Seridan.": "在森林营地被打败后，许多强盗都回到了他们在山顶的据点。这个堡垒能够抵御大规模的攻击，而它在山区的位置使它成为一个危险的攻击地点。议会认为应该要求冒险家们把土匪的领导层彻底赶出去，最终使汉伯伍德摆脱他们的偷窃和残暴。鉴于一场重大的遭遇战将被证明是灾难性的，委员会呼吁英雄们利用他们成熟的技能潜入堡垒，并派遣强盗联盟的领导人。本纳-塞里丹。",
	"The Crest Mountains are located roughly five days away from the capital. The party must travel through the forest before they can begin their ascent of the Crest. For the sake of pacing, choose to simply start the party at the foot of the mountains. Given the importance of their mission, it's reasonable that Alderheart would send an entourage of guards to escort the party to the base of the mountain, which would provide sufficient protection to eliminate the risk of encounters.": "峰顶山位于离首都大约五天的路程。队伍在开始攀登峰顶之前必须穿越森林。出于节奏的考虑，选择简单地在山脚下开始他们的行程。考虑到他们任务的重要性，Alderheart有理由派一个随行的卫兵护送队伍到山脚下，这将提供足够的保护，消除遭遇的风险。",
	"If the group consists of players who enjoy the experience of traveling across open country with their characters, use the {@table Road Encounters|Humblewood} table, or the {@table Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|Humblewood} table to provide some color to the journey. However they choose to arrive there, players will be greeted by a majestic sight:": "如果这个小组由喜欢和他们的角色一起穿越开放国家的玩家组成，可以使用{@table Road Encounters|Humblewood}表，或者{@table Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|Humblewood}表来为旅程提供一些色彩。无论他们如何选择到达那里，玩家都会被一个雄伟的景象所吸引。",
	"The jagged slopes of the Crest tower before you, their peaks obscured by clouds. There is but a single path ahead. The daunting ascent up the mountain looks to be the only way to reach the summit and the bandit stronghold.": "山脊的锯齿状斜坡在你面前耸立，它们的山峰被云层遮挡。前面只有一条路。令人生畏的上山之路，看来是到达山顶和匪徒据点的唯一途径。",
	"The crags and canyons of the Crest would be enough to deter even the most hardened explorers, and the ascent to the fortress will take time, roughly two days of travel up the steep mountain road. If the party has an escort, the escort will leave them at the base of the mountain and return to Alderheart.": "山顶的峭壁和峡谷足以让最顽强的探险者望而却步，而登上要塞也需要时间，大约要在陡峭的山路上走两天。如果队伍有护卫队，护卫队会在山脚下留下他们，然后返回阿尔德心。",
	"Along the way, the party will need to contend with rock slides, {@creature mountain lion|Humblewood|mountain lions}, and bandit patrols.": "一路上，他们需要应对岩石滑坡、（%0%）和强盗巡逻。",
	"The mountain climb can be fast-tracked by having at least one member of the party make a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check each day, skipping the day's encounter and potentially reaching the fortress without incident. On a failure, have the party deal with an encounter from the {@table Mountain Road Encounters|Humblewood} table. The paths that lead up the Crest are narrow and weave between craggy outcrops (perfect for ambushes), or along sheer cliffs (perfect for traps), but it would be appropriate to create other terrain hazards for a given encounter.": "爬山可以通过每天让至少一名成员进行DC14智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查来快速完成，跳过当天的遭遇，并有可能顺利到达要塞。如果失败，则让队伍处理{@table Mountain Road Encounters|Humblewood}表中的一个遭遇。通往山顶的道路很狭窄，在峭壁之间穿行（非常适合伏击），或者沿着陡峭的悬崖（非常适合陷阱），但为特定的遭遇创造其他地形危险也是合适的。",
	"To maintain the secrecy and security of the fortress, the bandits regularly patrol the paths. These patrols are comprised primarily of three {@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood|mapach bandits} and two {@creature jerbeen thief|Humblewood|jerbeen thieves}, but if the party has been spotted by patrols at any point, add a {@creature vulpin captain|Humblewood} to the encounter.": "为了维护要塞的秘密和安全，土匪们定期在小路上巡逻。这些巡逻队主要由三个{@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood|mapach bandits}和两个{@creature jerbeen thief|Humblewood|jerbeen thieves}组成，但如果队伍在任何时候被巡逻队发现，则在遭遇战中加一个{@creature vulpin captain|Humblewood}。",
	"Finally, through the mist you see a pair of great stone towers looming on the horizon. As you approach, you notice they are connected to a squat and sturdy fortress, which stands in lonely vigil among the crags. A few distant shapes can be seen patrolling the parapets, and banners with the crest of the Bandit Coalition hang proudly from the walls.": "最后，透过薄雾，你看到一对巨大的石塔在地平线上隐约可见。当你走近时，你注意到它们与一座矮小而坚固的堡垒相连，它孤独地站在峭壁间守望。可以看到几个遥远的身影在护栏上巡逻，墙上骄傲地挂着印有强盗联盟徽章的旗帜。",
	"Entering the fortress proper will be a challenge. It has 100-foot-high stone walls with guard posts stationed around the perimeter. Behind the perimeter, the fortress opens into a square, 120-foot-long inner courtyard consisting of barracks and training areas. A narrow wagon-road leads from the north of the courtyard to a wooden palisade with a set of double doors. Beyond that, a meeting hall has been dug into the mountain itself, and serves as the inner keep.": "进入要塞本身将是一个挑战。它有100英尺高的石墙，周围驻有岗哨。在围墙后面，堡垒进入一个正方形、120英尺长的内院，包括兵营和训练区。一条狭窄的马车道从院子的北部通向一个带有一组双门的木制栅栏。在那之后，一个会议厅被挖进了山体本身，并作为内部守卫。",
	"Connecting the courtyard to the outside is a single large entrance on the front wall: a massive wooden door behind an iron portcullis, which can be lowered like a drawbridge for wagons. A smaller, 5-foot-wide door to the side allows for single-file entry and is guarded by two well-armored mapachs who are big for their kind. These two each use the stat block for a {@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood}, but with the following changes:": "连接院子和外面的是前墙上的一个大入口：一个巨大的木门在一个铁门闩后面，可以像吊桥一样放倒马车。侧面有一扇较小的、5英尺宽的门，可以单人进入，由两个身穿铠甲的马帕奇人守卫，他们的体型都很高大。这两个人各使用一个{@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood}的状态块，但有以下变化。",
	"They have 21 HP each": "他们每个人都有21马力",
	"They have a Strength score of 14 (an additional +1 to attack rolls)": "他们的力量值为14（攻击卷的额外+1）。",
	"They are wearing {@item chain mail|phb} (AC 16)": "他们穿着（%0%）（AC 16）。",
	"They are wielding {@item greataxe|phb|greataxes} ({@damage 1d12 + 2} damage per hit)": "他们挥舞着{@item greataxe|phb|greataxes}({@damage 1d12 + 2}每击的伤害)。",
	"Storming this entrance will almost certainly raise an alarm and incur attacks from the four archers walking the walls (use the stat block for a {@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood}). The archers each benefit from three-quarters cover thanks to the parapets. Even though the stat block of the mapach bandit can be used for many of the least-skilled members of the camp, they come from a variety of humblefolk races. Hedges, cervans, jerbeens, and vulpins can all be found within their ranks.": "冲进这个入口几乎肯定会引起警报，并招致走在墙上的四个弓箭手的攻击（使用状态块来获得（%0%））。由于护栏的存在，弓箭手都能得到四分之三的掩护。即使mapach强盗的状态块可以用于营地中许多技能最低的成员，他们来自各种卑微的种族。在他们的队伍中，赫德斯、塞万斯、杰尔宾和秃鹫都可以找到。",
	"There are many ways things could go badly for a party of adventurers here. If by chance they are overwhelmed by bandits, remember that Benna won't necessarily want them dead. She'll want to question them first, so the party will be placed in the fortress' prison until she's satisfied she has the answers she wants. If Benna has any reason to believe some of the characters are valuable hostages, she'll happily keep them alive in order to ransom them to the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart and continue filling the Coalition's coffers. If any of the party members are humblefolk, she might even try to convince them to join the Coalition. Birdfolk have had power in these lands for too long. If the character accepts her offer, once her plan to get revenge on the Council is complete, she'll be sure they share in the spoils.": "在这里，有很多方法可以让冒险者的队伍变得很糟糕。如果他们碰巧被强盗打倒，请记住本娜不一定想让他们死。她想先审问他们，所以他们会被关在堡垒的监狱里，直到她满意地得到她想要的答案。如果本娜有任何理由相信某些角色是有价值的人质，她会很乐意让他们活着，以便将他们赎回给阿尔德心的鸟人议会，继续填充联盟的库房。如果党员中有人是卑贱的人，她甚至会试图说服他们加入联盟。鸟人在这些土地上拥有权力已经太久了。如果这个角色接受了她的提议，一旦她向议会复仇的计划完成，她会确保他们分享战利品。",
	"If there are any humblefolk in the party, and the party managed to get their hands on bandit outfits (either by taking some with them from the bandits defeated near Alderheart or from defeated bandit patrols on their way up the mountainside), those characters can easily disguise themselves and bluff their way into the fortress. The bandit ranks have grown steadily over the last few months, and new arrivals to the fortress are common. A birdfolk can attempt to bluff their way in, but this will be a little more challenging, requiring a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check to fool the bandits. A few \"odd birds\" have sided with the bandits, but their numbers are low enough to make the guards suspicious. Unless they are being introduced as \"prisoners\" rounded up by the humblefolk, birdfolk characters infiltrating the base will need to be careful of catching Benna's eye. They will face immediate suspicion from her if they are noticed.": "如果队伍里有任何卑微的人，而且队伍设法得到了强盗的服装（要么是从阿尔德心附近被击败的强盗那里带走一些，要么是从上山途中被击败的强盗巡逻队那里得到的），这些角色可以轻易地伪装自己，虚张声势地进入要塞。在过去的几个月里，强盗的队伍不断壮大，新来的要塞人员也很常见。鸟人可以尝试虚张声势，但这将是一个更大的挑战，需要用DC14魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查来欺骗强盗们。有几只 \"怪鸟 \"站在强盗一边，但它们的数量少到足以让守卫们起疑。除非他们被介绍为被卑鄙小人围捕的 \"囚犯\"，否则潜入基地的鸟人角色需要注意吸引本娜的注意。如果他们被注意到，他们将立即面临来自她的怀疑。",
	"Any character wearing Fray's sword will have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks needed to enter the stronghold, as the sword denotes a captain's rank in the Coalition, and the sentries won't want to risk offending a ranking officer. While there aren't many bandits here who would recognize it as Fray's sword, any character openly wearing this weapon will need to be careful around Benna. She knows her captains well, and this will draw immediate suspicion.": "任何佩戴弗雷之剑的角色在进入据点所需的魅力（（%0%））检查中都有优势，因为这把剑代表了联盟中队长的级别，而哨兵们不想冒险冒犯一个高级官员。虽然这里没有多少强盗会认出这是弗雷的剑，但任何公开佩戴这把武器的角色在本娜身边都需要小心。她很了解她的队长们，这将立即引起怀疑。",
	"While the fortress walls are high, they are still surmountable with at least 100 feet of rope and a {@item grappling hook|phb}, but the party will need to approach this option with caution. Spending a few hours on a stakeout will reveal the guard patrol patterns well enough to attempt to infiltrate the fortress with advantage on the DC 15 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check required to avoid the sentries. Stealthier parties may be able to slip in unnoticed without such preparation.": "虽然堡垒的墙很高，但只要有至少100英尺的绳子和{@item grappling hook|phb}，还是可以翻越的，但队伍需要谨慎地对待这个方案。花几个小时的时间进行监视，就能很好地发现守卫的巡逻模式，从而在躲避哨兵所需的DC15集体灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查中取得优势，尝试潜入堡垒。更加隐蔽的队伍可能会在没有准备的情况下悄悄溜进去。",
	"In addition to the above options, the party could choose a number of other routes to gain entry. Below are some possible options that would open a path to Benna:": "除了上述选项外，当事人还可以选择其他一些路线来获得进入。以下是一些可能的选择，可以打开通往本纳的道路。",

	"{@b {@i Causing a scene outside the fortress or in the courtyard,}} goading Benna to come out and fight. She will accept the terms of single combat, but the party will need to abide by the results and be prepared to be taken as hostages if they lose (see {@adventure The Prison|hwcs|2|The Prison}).

	"{@b {@i If the party stakes out the fortress,}} they'll find that wagons with stolen goods make regular shipments up to the keep.

	"{@b {@i If characters encountered the jerbeen orphans in Alderheart, and treated them fairly,}} the orphans can turn up in the fortress as insider allies.

	"The party can always choose to simply try to fight their way into the fortress, but it isn't recommended. It might not be too hard for them to force their way past the outer walls and into the courtyard, but from there, resistance will only increase (see {@adventure Entering By Force|hwcs|2|Entering By Force}). If the characters are getting in over their heads, have Benna appear early to fight them without having too many smaller confrontations.": "队伍总是可以选择简单地试图打进堡垒，但不建议这样做。对他们来说，强行越过外墙进入院子可能并不难，但从那里开始，阻力只会越来越大（见（%0%））。如果人物越来越多，可以让本纳提前出现，与他们战斗，不要有太多的小规模对抗。",
	"The wide courtyard contains a small community of humblefolk, some wearing arms and armor, others unarmed and going about their day. There are two buildings inside the walls, as well as a narrow road leading up to the meeting hall. A few points of interest can be seen here:": "宽阔的院子里有一小群卑微的人，有些人穿着武器和盔甲，有些人没有武器，正在进行他们的日常生活。城墙内有两座建筑，以及一条通往会议厅的狭窄道路。这里可以看到一些有趣的点。",

	"Spiral stairs at the intersecting corners of each of the walls provide access to the upper levels. The pathways along the top of the wall are 5 feet wide, and provide three-quarters cover for characters firing down on targets.": "在每面墙的交角处都有螺旋形的楼梯，提供了通往上层的通道。沿着墙顶的通道有5英尺宽，为人物向目标射击提供四分之三的掩护。",
	"There are two large levers inside the gate. One controls the portcullis, and the other the drawbridge. The drawbridge lever can be pulled quickly, causing it to swing open. The portcullis lever drops the portcullis across the entrance. Large rope pulleys on either side are used to reset the levers.": "门内有两个大杠杆。一个是控制舷窗，另一个是控制吊桥。可以快速拉动吊桥杆，使其摆动开来。舷窗杆可以将舷窗放下，横跨入口。两侧的大绳滑轮用于重置杠杆。",
	"There are at least a dozen bandits inside the courtyard. Some are training by the barracks, some are helping move supplies around the fort, and others are simply enjoying downtime by reading and whittling behind the safety of the walls.": "院子里至少有十几个土匪。有些人在军营边上训练，有些人在帮助堡垒周围搬运物资，还有一些人只是在安全的城墙后面看书和削皮，享受休息时间。",
	"If the party snuck in or managed to bluff their way inside, it's pretty easy to keep a low profile and explore the courtyard. Most bandits will assume they're supposed to be here, unless the party does something to draw the suspicion of the captains.

She has really changed things for the better, and the stronghold is now well-stocked and prepared, even if Alderheart sends an army to drive them out.": "在塞里丹将军接手之前，强盗联盟曾经是一支组织性和有效性都很差的部队。她真的把事情改变了，现在的据点储备充足，准备充分，即使Alderheart派军队来赶他们走。",
	"Not all who live here can fight. Some work as messengers, cooks, healers, and other odd jobs that keep the camp running. The General has never forced anyone to fight. She inspires them to take up arms by example, and support the cause to the best of their abilities.": "不是所有住在这里的人都能打仗。有些人担任信使、厨师、医护人员，以及其他维持营地运转的零星工作。将军从来没有强迫任何人作战。她以身作则，激励他们拿起武器，并尽其所能地支持这一事业。",
	"General Seridan has taken excellent care of the people here since the fires burned their homes and ruined their lives. There is an infirmary in the inner keep to treat those burned while fleeing their villages or wounded in raids. Some of the refugees are children, but Benna has provided for them all the same.": "自从大火烧毁了他们的家园，毁掉了他们的生活之后，塞里丹将军对这里的人们给予了很好的照顾。在内城有一个医务室，用于治疗那些在逃离村庄时被烧伤或在袭击中受伤的人。有些难民是儿童，但本纳也为他们提供了同样的服务。",

If any archers have been left on the walls, they will fire from three-quarters cover throughout the fights, only retreating once the last of the bandit forces have been dispatched. During the fight, the rest of the bandits here will have made their way up the road to the inner fortress.": "如果一行人打进去，或者决定一进去就开打，他们就会被一波又一波的袭击，因为信使们急着提醒本纳，而营地里的其他人则为最坏的情况做准备。起初，队伍会在一个{@creature vulpin captain|Humblewood}带领下与四个{@creature mapach bandit|Humblewood|mapach bandits}战斗，然后是两个{@creature jerbeen thief|Humblewood|jerbeen thieves}和另一个{@creature vulpin captain|Humblewood}。如果有弓箭手留在城墙上，他们将在整个战斗过程中从四分之三的掩体中射击，只有在最后一个强盗部队被打发走后才会撤退。在战斗中，这里剩下的强盗会沿着道路向内部堡垒前进。",

	"Upstairs, the party will find more rows of bunk beds, some occupied, as well as a door marked \"Captains' Quarters.\" Entry to this area is off limits to most bandits, but individuals bearing a captain's sword may enter untroubled. Otherwise, anyone in the nearby bunks will politely inform the party that the area is restricted. They may even introduce themselves, as new recruits are common, and declare how good it is to see new members for the cause.

All the beds are empty, and the trunks each contain different personal effects, such as small trinkets and letters from friends and family. Some of the letters reveal that the captains have friends and family in the Coalition, while others are scattered among the Wood as refugees.

There are also torches, lanterns, rope, and other general supplies. There isn't much in the way of a guard here, but a hedge with bright eyes and incredibly thick spectacles does serve as the storeroom's keeper. He'll mention the characters are free to take something if they're hungry, but to let him know so he can record it in his ledger. If questioned, his attitude will be similar to that of the other bandits in the camp (see {@adventure The Art of Infiltration|hwcs|2|The Art of Infiltration}), and he will call the guards if the party arouses his suspicion.": "在这个贮藏室里找不到什么有价值的东西，它保存着足够的食物（水果、蔬菜、腌制的肉类和谷物），可以维持堡垒很长一段时间。还有火把、灯笼、绳子和其他一般用品。这里没有什么守卫，但一个有着明亮的眼睛和令人难以置信的厚厚的眼镜的篱笆确实是储藏室的管理员。他会提到，如果他们饿了，可以随便拿一些东西，但要让他知道，以便他能把这些东西记录在他的账簿上。如果被询问，他的态度会和营地里的其他强盗相似（见（%0%）），如果队伍引起他的怀疑，他会叫来卫兵。",

The cages are all currently empty.": "这个大帆布帐篷的内部有一个小的开放区域，里面有一个上了锁的大箱子，还有一张椅子，狱警就坐在那里，她的腰带上松散地挂着一圈钥匙。其余的地方摆放着四个看起来生锈的铁笼子。这些笼子目前都是空的。",
	"If any of the party members are captured, or brought into the fort posing as hostages, they'll wind up here in one or more of the cages. This tent is watched by two {@creature jerbeen thief|Humblewood|jerbeen thieves}, and attacking them directly is all but certain to raise an alarm within the camp. Any weapons or treasure (coins, gems, and art objects) characters carry will be moved into the gaoler's chest until they can be properly sorted. All other clothing and equipment worn by the prisoner will be left alone. The gaoler is a bit lax and doesn't bother to remove anyone's armor, or do a detailed search. This might be a boon for any characters who have hidden objects on their person.": "如果任何党员被俘，或被冒充人质带入堡垒，他们会被关在这里的一个或多个笼子里。这个帐篷有两个人看守（%0%），直接攻击他们几乎肯定会引起营地内的警报。角色携带的任何武器或宝物（硬币、宝石和艺术品）都将被移到看守人的箱子里，直到它们被妥善分类。囚犯所穿的所有其他衣服和设备将被单独留下。狱警有点松懈，懒得脱掉任何人的盔甲，也懒得做详细的搜查。这对任何身上有隐藏物品的人物来说可能是个福音。",
	"Gaolers trade shifts once a day at noon, passing the belt from which the keyring hangs to the next gaoler as they arrive. The gaoler is more of an attendant than the guards outside, and can be easily subdued by a character (use the {@creature commoner} stat block).

They are a tad complacent however, as no prisoners have tried to escape.": "狱卒每天中午换一次班，当他们到达时，将挂着钥匙圈的皮带传给下一个狱卒。与外面的守卫相比，门卫更像是一个服务员，可以被一个角色轻易制服（使用（%0%）状态块）。狱警的工作是呆在他们的岗位上，如果有什么事发生，就叫警卫。不过他们有点自满，因为没有囚犯试图逃跑。",
	"The prison tent is held up by poles throughout its interior, and four pitons that keep it all in place. The flaps of the tent can be lifted easily. Clearly, the tent's function is mainly to keep the cages from rusting further. The makeshift prison's interior is 30-foot-wide and 35-foot-long, and light filters through the canvas during the daytime making it easy to distinguish day and night. The cages are 10-foot-cubes, and have 10-foot-wide paths between them. They nearly fill the small space, leaving barely 5 feet between the gaoler and the bars. This is easily enough distance for a character to attempt to grab the keyring on the gaoler's belt, so long as the party can create a distraction to keep the gaoler occupied while they work. Grabbing the keyring from the gaoler's belt requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check, but depending on the nature of the distraction (such as if the gaoler is put to sleep) advantage may be granted on this roll.": "监狱帐篷在整个内部由杆子支撑着，还有四个钉子使其保持原位。帐篷的挡板可以轻易掀开。很明显，帐篷的功能主要是为了防止笼子进一步生锈。这个临时监狱的内部有30英尺宽，35英尺长，白天光线透过帆布，很容易分辨出白天和黑夜。笼子是10英尺长的立方体，它们之间有10英尺宽的通道。它们几乎填满了这个狭小的空间，在狱卒和铁栅栏之间几乎只剩下5英尺。这个距离足以让一个角色试图抓住狱卒腰带上的钥匙圈，只要他们在工作时能分散狱卒的注意力。从狱卒的腰带上抓取钥匙圈需要成功地进行DC15灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查，但是根据分散注意力的性质（比如如果狱卒睡着了），在这个检查中可能会获得优势。",

The trauma that led her to join the Coalition, as well as the actions she took to become its general, have hardened her heart, and she is bent not only on change, but revenge. She loathes the Birdfolk Council, whom she still holds responsible for the deaths of her family and the destruction of her home. She also blames them for the suffering of all those who have lost their homes to the flames, as the Council has chosen to hide behind the bastion of Alderheart instead of reaching out to help folk in need. However, Benna has begun to find solace in the act of caring for others. Building a community here, using her combat experience to teach others to defend themselves, and inspiring the once hopeless people of the Wood has ignited a passion within her, and she desperately wants to do right by her people. She has begun to wonder if there might be a better way to lead, one which wouldn't place so many of her loved ones in harm's way.": "他们之间的交往可以通过角色扮演来进行，或者让本娜简单地引诱对方，解释说她会一劳永逸地结束他们对她在这里的行动所构成的威胁（见（%0%））。本娜并不是不讲道理的人，如果他们与她接触，她会听从他们的意见。她很矛盾，也因此难以预料。导致她加入联盟的创伤，以及她为成为联盟将军而采取的行动，使她的心变得坚硬，她不仅一心想要改变，而且要报复。她厌恶鸟人委员会，她仍然认为他们应对她的家人的死亡和她的家园的毁灭负责。她还将所有在火焰中失去家园的人的痛苦归咎于他们，因为议会选择躲在阿尔德心的堡垒后面，而不是伸出手来帮助需要帮助的人。然而，本娜已经开始在关心他人的行为中找到慰藉。在这里建立一个社区，用她的战斗经验教别人保护自己，并激励曾经无望的森林人民，这点燃了她内心的激情，她迫切地想为她的人民做正确的事。她开始思考是否有更好的领导方式，而不是将她的许多亲人置于危险之中。",
	"Should a character offer a particularly impassioned and heartfelt plea, decide how Benna behaves based on their roleplaying. If a player has to roll, their character must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. A successful negotiation will only be enough for Benna to agree to treat with the Birdfolk Council, her hated enemies, so that the lives she has fought to save are not lost needlessly in the struggle. If this is accomplished, the party will be allowed to leave the camp to deliver Benna's terms to the Council, but bandit activity will not stop in the interim. Failure to sway her here will lead to combat.": "如果一个角色提供了一个特别慷慨激昂、发自内心的恳求，请根据他们的角色扮演决定本纳的行为。如果玩家必须掷骰子，他们的角色必须在DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查中成功。谈判成功后，本娜才会同意与鸟人议会（她憎恨的敌人）进行治疗，这样她为之奋斗的生命就不会在斗争中无谓地丧失。如果做到了这一点，队伍将被允许离开营地，将本娜的条件交给议会，但在此期间，土匪活动不会停止。如果不能在这里动摇她，将导致战斗。",

	"The Bandit Coalition will keep control of the fortress. Either Benna will retain command, or she'll support a new leader being appointed for the Coalition—this could be the characters (if they so choose), or someone selected from among Benna's captains. The Council will work with whoever leads the Coalition, provided the party (if they don't take over themselves) can vouch for the leader's good intentions and agrees to keep them in line.

	"With the Coalition's supply networks and Alderheart's resources working together, response times for relief efforts will be greatly improved. While some members of the Coalition will abandon the cause for their own gains, many will be willing to help it transition into an organization dedicated to helping fight the spreading fires and provide relief and shelter to those in need. The Birdfolk Council will release a decree: they will become the Humblewood Council, and new representatives from major humblefolk villages in the regions and within Alderheart itself will be added to their numbers, effectively giving humblefolk across the Wood a voice in governance for the first time. This significant change will take the span of the adventure to resolve, but by the end, the Humblewood Council will lead the way to a new era of unity in Humblewood. Now dedicated to peace, Benna will show her gratitude by presenting the party with the {@item blade of the wood|Humblewood} she once wielded.": "有了联盟的供应网络和Alderheart的资源合作，救援工作的响应时间将大大改善。虽然联盟的一些成员会为了自己的利益而放弃这一事业，但许多人愿意帮助它过渡到一个致力于帮助扑灭不断蔓延的大火并为需要的人提供救济和庇护的组织。鸟人委员会将发布一项法令：他们将成为谦卑森林委员会，来自各地区和阿尔德心本身的主要谦卑村庄的新代表将加入他们的行列，有效地让整个森林的谦卑人首次在管理中拥有发言权。这一重大变化将在整个冒险过程中得到解决，但到最后，谦卑之森议会将引领谦卑之森进入一个新的团结的时代。现在，本娜致力于和平，她将向党派赠送她曾经挥舞过的{@item blade of the wood|Humblewood}以示感谢。",
	"{@b {@i If Benna was killed,}} between losing their camp near Alderheart and their mountain stronghold, the Coalition will be dealt a heavy blow and the bandit menace will no longer pose the same threat to the region. Many will lose hope and desert without Benna, but others will see her as a martyr and rally under a surviving captain. Members will work from safehouses in the forests, doing their best to keep the Coalition command structure intact, and continue to cause problems for the Wood after the events of this adventure. Perhaps peace can be achieved someday, when the wounds of losing their beloved leader aren't so fresh. But, without Benna, the Coalition won't trust or treat with outsiders.": "{@b {@i If Benna was killed,}}在失去Alderheart附近的营地和他们的山地据点之间，联盟将受到沉重打击，强盗的威胁将不再对该地区构成同样的威胁。许多人将失去希望，在没有本娜的情况下开小差，但其他人会将她视为殉道者，并在幸存的队长手下团结起来。成员们将在森林中的安全屋工作，尽力保持联盟指挥结构的完整，并在这次冒险的事件后继续给伍德带来麻烦。也许有一天可以实现和平，当失去他们心爱的领袖的伤口不再那么新鲜时。但是，没有本纳，联盟不会信任或对待外人。",
	"Once the bandit general has been defeated, the Council will send an armed force to secure the stronghold. Should the players wish, this could become their base of operations. The Council will happily grant this boon to the party as they have proven themselves to be valuable allies and defenders of the realm.

	"Tevor was summoned to Alderheart by the Council just like the party, but he isn't sure why. It's clear from the pained expression on Havel's face that there's more to the story. A DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check will reveal Tevor is lying. Tevor won't answer anymore questions about his summons, and he will leave if pressed for information. So long as Tevor isn't around, Havel can be made to divulge what he knows with a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check: Tevor only barely escaped an encounter with an unknown monster that has been hunting Tenders in the Scorched Grove. Tevor doesn't talk about it, but Havel heard that Tevor's instructor died.": "泰沃和党一样被理事会召唤到阿尔德心，但他不清楚原因。从哈维尔脸上痛苦的表情可以看出，这个故事还有下文。通过DC14智慧({@skill Insight})检查会发现泰沃在说谎。泰沃不会再回答关于他的召唤的问题，如果被追问，他将离开。只要泰沃不在身边，哈维尔就可以通过DC12魅力({@skill Persuasion})的检查让他说出他知道的事情。泰沃只是勉强逃过了一次与未知怪物的交锋，该怪物一直在焦土林中猎杀施暴者。泰沃没有谈及此事，但哈维尔听说泰沃的教官死了。",
	"Havel will share that he'll likely see the party again soon, since he and Tevor are both due to attend the Council chambers tomorrow.": "哈维尔将分享他可能很快就会再次看到这个聚会，因为他和特沃尔明天都要参加理事会会议厅。",
	"When the characters enter the Council chambers they are met with an unusual sight: it is filled with people! Birdfolk, humblefolk, Tenders, and even a few people from beyond the Wood have assembled here:": "当人物进入议会厅时，他们看到了一个不寻常的景象：这里到处都是人! 鸟人、卑贱的人、投标人，甚至还有一些来自森林之外的人都聚集在这里。",
	"All those assembled clamor over each other, their pleas desperate. Some are urging for an immediate removal of all Tenders from the Grove before more lives are lost. Some are calling for a mobilization of the Perch Guard to meet the monsters head on. It seems everyone has an opinion and is fighting to be heard. Tevor and Havel are here as well, standing patiently off to the side of the rabble.": "所有聚集在一起的人互相叫嚣着，他们的请求是绝望的。一些人敦促立即将所有投标人从丛林中移出，以免造成更多的生命损失。有些人则呼吁动员鲈鱼护卫队去迎击这些怪物。似乎每个人都有自己的观点，并在为自己的观点而奋斗。泰沃和哈维尔也在这里，耐心地站在乌合之众的一边。",
	"Shortly after the party enters, the familiar bright gallus seated in the middle of a long table at the front of the hall raises her feathered hand. This is {@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|Humblewood}. She waits patiently as many of the gathered birdfolk notice her gesture and fall silent. The silence in the hall is almost overwhelming in its contrast to the noise that filled it moments before.": "宴会进入后不久，坐在大厅前面长桌中间的那只熟悉的明亮的gallus举起了她的羽毛手。这是（%0%）。她耐心地等待着，许多聚集在一起的鸟人注意到她的手势，并陷入沉默。大厅里的寂静与刚才的嘈杂形成了鲜明的对比，几乎让人喘不过气来。",
	"When Bita speaks it is not with a booming voice or harsh language. The sound of command and respect permeate her every word. She addresses you and your companions simply. \"Thank you all for heeding our summons so quickly. The Wood is in great need, and many of our Tenders have already paid the dearest price to protect it. We hope you will hear our pleas and offer us your aid in this most dire of circumstances.\"": "当比塔讲话时，她的声音并不洪亮，语言也不刺耳。她的每一个字都渗透着命令和尊重的声音。她对你和你的同伴们的称呼很简单。\"谢谢你们这么快就听从我们的召唤。树林有很大的需要，我们的许多施暴者已经为保护它付出了最宝贵的代价。我们希望你们能听到我们的请求，并在这最危险的情况下向我们提供援助。\"",
	"Speaker Bita continues by describing clouds of emberbats, in larger numbers than have ever been seen. She speaks of strange fire creatures sighted in the Wood, and how they have injured many travelers. She then talks about the missing Tenders and the reports of a huge, unknown creature stalking the ash plains of the Grove. Something must be done, which is why the Council has called upon the help of the Defenders of Alderheart. Bita offers whatever information she can, but this creature is a new discovery and the Council has little to go on.": "比塔议长继续描述了琥珀蝙蝠云，其数量比以往任何时候都要多。她谈到了在森林中看到的奇怪的火生物，以及它们如何伤害了许多旅行者。然后她谈到了失踪的投标人，以及关于一个巨大的、未知的生物在丛林的灰烬平原上徘徊的报告。必须有所行动，这就是为什么理事会呼吁阿尔德心的保卫者们提供帮助。比塔提供了她所能提供的任何信息，但这种生物是一个新的发现，委员会没有什么可依靠的。",
	"Tevor is called up before the head table. He was the most recent Tender to encounter the massive beast in the Grove. He recalls seeing the ash of the plains seize up, as if some-thing were burrowing through. The creature never broke the surface, so he was unable to get a good look at it. It must have grabbed his instructor, though, as Tevor saw him get sucked under the ash. Tevor ran, until he was safe on the edge of the Scorched Grove.": "泰沃被叫到主桌前。他是最近在丛林中遇到巨大野兽的驯服者。他回忆说，他看到平原的灰烬被封住了，仿佛有什么东西在钻过。那怪物从未打破表面，所以他无法看清它。不过，它一定是抓住了他的教官，因为泰沃看到他被吸到了灰烬下面。泰沃跑了起来，直到他安全地站在焦土林的边缘。",
	"Tevor is obviously shaken after the account, but Havel places a hand on his shoulder, which seems to comfort him.": "特沃尔在述说后显然受到了震动，但哈维尔将一只手放在他的肩膀上，这似乎是在安慰他。",
	"Tevor points out on a map where this most recent sighting took place. Bita will mention that the Grove is a dangerous place, and ask Havel to look for someone to guide the party. At first, Tevor simply raises his hand to speak. It's clear that he is conflicted and his fear is getting the better of him. Despite this, he'll firmly state that he will guide the party to where he last saw the creature. He will admit his fear, but every second they waste is a chance for it to strike again.": "泰沃在地图上指出最近这次目击事件发生的地点。比塔会提到丛林是个危险的地方，并要求哈维尔找人引导这一行。起初，特沃尔只是举手发言。很明显，他很矛盾，他的恐惧感正在影响着他。尽管如此，他还是会坚定地表示，他将引导聚会到他最后一次看到那个生物的地方。他将承认他的恐惧，但他们浪费的每一秒钟都是它再次袭击的机会。",
	"The great ashen plain that stretches across the northwest forest has come to be called the Scorched Grove. The Grove is the result of a massive forest fire known as the Great Calamity, which raged centuries ago. It left the area altered, and strongly connected to the magic of elemental fire. This barren place has remained in such a state for as long as anyone in the Wood can remember.": "绵延于森林西北部的巨大灰烬平原被称为焦土丛林。这片丛林是几个世纪前一场被称为 \"大灾难 \"的巨大森林火灾的结果。它让这个地区发生了改变，并与火元素的魔法紧密相连。这个荒芜的地方一直保持着这样的状态，从森林里的任何人都能记得。",
	"The story of the Calamity that has been passed down through the Tenders goes like this:": "通过投标人流传下来的灾变故事是这样的。",
	"\"Long ago, birdfolk thought they could stop forest fires from devastating the Wood by using powerful otherworldly magics. But the plan backfired. Their magics only fueled the flames, and the Grove was consumed. By the grace of the Amaranthine, the birdfolk were able to lull the blaze into a quiet slumber. Though the flames were contained, the act unbalanced the elemental forces of the Wood for generations. This is why only gentle magics are used to help the earth heal. With nature, the slow way is the right way.\"": "\"很久以前，鸟人认为他们可以通过使用强大的异世界魔法来阻止森林大火对森林的破坏。但这个计划适得其反。他们的魔法只是助长了火焰，树林被吞噬了。在阿玛兰蒂恩的恩惠下，鸟人能够使大火进入安静的沉睡。虽然火焰被控制住了，但这一行为使木之元素的力量世代失衡。这就是为什么只使用温和的魔法来帮助地球愈合。对于大自然，缓慢的方式才是正确的方式。\"",
	"To get to the Scorched Grove by road the party will need to head back toward Winnowing Reach, then continue west until the road nears the southern edge of the Grove. While this is the easiest path, it will take four days to arrive at the location where Tevor last saw the beast. If the party takes the long road, they are not at risk of an encounter.": "要通过公路到达焦土丛林，他们需要回到温诺因河，然后继续向西走，直到公路接近丛林的南边。虽然这是最简单的道路，但是需要四天时间才能到达泰沃最后看到野兽的地方。如果队伍走的是长路，他们就不会有遭遇的风险。",
	"Alternatively, the party can take a more direct approach through the forest to the northeastern edge of the Grove, very near where the beast was last spotted.": "另外，他们可以通过森林更直接地接近丛林的东北部边缘，就在最后发现野兽的地方。",
	"If the party takes the direct approach, they will reach their destination in two days, but they'll likely run into some trouble. After one of the following encounters (either {@b A Cloud of Emberbats} or {@b The Flaming Specter}), the party will make good time to the location described by Tevor. Choose one of the encounters below.": "如果队伍采取直接的方法，他们将在两天内到达目的地，但他们很可能会遇到一些麻烦。在经历了以下其中一个遭遇（%0%）或{@b The Flaming Specter}后，队伍将顺利到达泰沃描述的地点。选择下面的一个遭遇。",
	"While nearing the Scorched Grove, you begin to hear a faint sound far off in the distance. The sound quickly grows louder, and a cacophony of screeches reaches your ears before you see the source: a great cloud of emberbats is consuming the sparse forest to the north. They are still a distance away, but you can feel the combined heat of their bodies even from here. A bright and mysterious orange light can occasionally be seen shining in between them. ": "在接近焦土林的时候，你开始听到远处传来一阵微弱的声音。这声音很快就变大了，在你看到源头之前，一阵刺耳的尖叫声传到了你的耳朵里：一大团琥珀蝙蝠正在吞噬北方稀疏的森林。它们仍有一段距离，但你即使在这里也能感觉到它们身体的综合热量。偶尔可以看到一道明亮而神秘的橙色光芒在它们之间闪耀。",
	"Tevor will try to sound calm as he advises against rushing in blindly, but it's clear that he's frightened of this swarming mass of emberbats. He'll support the party however he can while maintaining a safe distance.": "泰沃在建议不要盲目地冲进去时，会尽量听起来很平静，但很明显，他对这群蜂拥而至的微光蝙蝠感到很害怕。他将在保持安全距离的情况下尽可能地支持党的工作。",
	"The emberbat cloud takes up the space of a Huge creature, and it has 103 hit points and resistance to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage. It also has the following properties:": "琥珀蝙蝠云占据了一个巨大生物的空间，它有103点命中率和对砍击、打击和穿刺伤害的抵抗。它还具有以下属性。",
	"It can fly at a speed of 30 feet per round and it begins 60 feet away from the party.": "它可以以每回合30英尺的速度飞行，而且它开始时离当事人60英尺远。",
	"The heat generated by the emberbats is so intense that any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw when they enter this area, or start their turn inside of it, taking 4 ({@dice 1d8}) points of fire damage on a failure.": "琥珀蝙蝠产生的热量是如此强烈，以至于30英尺范围内的任何生物在进入这个区域时都必须进行DC13宪法救赎，或者在这个区域内开始他们的回合，如果失败，将受到4({@dice 1d8})点火力伤害。",
	"The emberbats' space can be entered and moved through freely, but the heat inside is so intense that creatures inside this area take 7 ({@dice 2d8}) points of fire damage if they end their turn inside it.": "琥珀蝙蝠的空间可以自由进入和移动，但是里面的热量非常强烈，如果在这个区域内结束他们的回合，会受到7（（%0%））点的火焰伤害。",
	"Any creature that enters the emberbats' space will see that they are swarming around a glowing ball of molten orange energy. This orb is only a foot across and shines like a miniature sun, making it difficult to target.": "任何进入微光蝙蝠空间的生物都会看到，它们正围绕着一个熔化的橙色能量的发光球蜂拥而至。这个球体只有一英尺宽，像一个微型的太阳一样闪闪发光，使它难以被瞄准。",
	"The orb can be attacked, and has the following properties:": "该球体可以被攻击，并具有以下属性。",
	"30 hit points": "30点命中率",
	"Immunity to fire damage": "对火灾伤害的免疫力",
	"Vulnerability to cold damage": "易受冷损伤的影响",
	"Resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage dealt by non-magical weapons": "抵抗非魔法武器造成的重击、砍击和穿刺伤害",
	"It is magic, and registers as conjuration magic if examined with {@spell detect magic} or a similar effect": "它是魔法，如果用{@spell detect magic}或类似的效果来检查，就会被登记为施展魔法。",
	"Once this orb is destroyed, the cloud of emberbats will gradually disperse, taking 4 rounds to disappear completely. If the bats are killed, but the orb remains, the orb will fly off in a random direction at a speed of 60 feet per round, streaking through the forest, eventually slowing down as it attracts a new cloud of emberbats.": "一旦这个球体被摧毁，琥珀蝙蝠云会逐渐散去，需要4个回合才能完全消失。如果蝙蝠被杀死了，但球体还在，球体将以每回合60英尺的速度向一个随机的方向飞去，在森林中穿行，最终在吸引新的琥珀蝙蝠云时放慢速度。",
	"Whatever type of energy the orb was, it seemed to be exciting the emberbats, driving them to cloud in large numbers. A difficult DC 17 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check will be enough for a character to ascertain similarities between this phenomena and similar instances mentioned in conjuration textbooks: when high-level conjuration circles deteriorate, such energy nodes have been observed being intermittently released.": "不管这个球体是什么类型的能量，它似乎在刺激微光蝙蝠，驱使它们大量聚集在一起。一个困难的DC17智力（（%0%））检查就足以让一个角色确定这一现象与施法课本中提到的类似事例之间的相似性：当高级施法圈恶化时，已经观察到这种能量节点被间歇性地释放。",
	"While making your way through the tranquil forest, you see what looks to be a blazing fire off in the distance. As you look at the fire, you notice the flames have taken on a birdfolk-like form, resembling a weeping corvum. It's far enough away that you could make it past without being noticed, but branches of the trees around its body are already beginning to smolder.": "当你穿过宁静的森林时，你看到远处似乎有一团熊熊燃烧的火。当你看向火堆时，你注意到火焰呈现出一种鸟类的形态，类似于哭泣的科沃姆。它离得很远，你可以在不被注意的情况下过去，但它身体周围的树枝已经开始冒烟了。",
	"This creature is a fire specter, a memory of a former inhabitant of the Scorched Grove animated by the flames that took its life. Tevor will be able to identify the creature immediately. He'll also add that such entities are only found in the deepest parts of the Grove, and it's unheard of to see one so far from the Grove itself. The Tenders are taught to leave them be, as they will dissipate once they have fulfilled their purpose, which usually consists of re-enacting a memory from the life of the victim. Tevor will warn the party that disturbing the specter risks invoking its wrath.": "这个生物是一个火系幽灵，是一个被火焰夺去生命的焦土丛林前居民的记忆。泰沃将能够立即识别这个生物。他还会补充说，这种实体只在丛林的最深处被发现，在离丛林本身这么远的地方看到这种实体是闻所未闻的。牧师们被教导不要管他们，因为他们一旦完成了自己的目的就会消散，这通常包括重新演绎受害者生命中的一段记忆。泰沃会警告当事人，打扰幽灵有可能引起它的愤怒。",
	"If characters interact with the specter peacefully, read this:": "如果角色与幽灵和平互动，请阅读这个。",
	"As you approach, the creature appears unaware of your presence. It is on its knees, and continues to fruitlessly grasp at something in the underbrush, only to burn any plant life it touches. With each failed attempt the creature places its head in its talons and shudders in a way that suggests weeping.": "当你接近时，这个生物似乎没有意识到你的存在。它跪在地上，继续无果地抓着灌木丛中的什么东西，只是为了烧毁它所接触到的任何植物。每次尝试失败后，它都把头放在爪子里，以一种暗示哭泣的方式颤抖着。",
	"The memory this creature is enacting is one of picking flowers to place at a nearby gravesite. Players must figure this out on their own. If a character examines the area, with a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check they will be able to locate an overgrown wooden grave marker covered by reeds. The singed, desiccated bush the specter keeps reaching for matches bushes on either side of it, around which small patches of bluebells grow. Simply gathering any number of these flowers and placing them upon the grave will be enough to cause the specter to dissipate harmlessly.": "这个生物正在进行的记忆是采摘鲜花放在附近的墓地上。玩家必须自己弄清楚这一点。如果一个角色检查这个区域，通过DC14智力（（%0%））检查，他们能够找到一个被芦苇覆盖的杂草丛生的木制墓碑。幽灵一直伸手去抓的那片被烧焦的干枯灌木，在它的两边匹配着灌木丛，周围生长着小片的蓝铃花。只要收集任何数量的这些花并将它们放在坟墓上，就足以使幽灵无害地消散。",
	"Remind the players that their time is limited, as the mere presence of the specter is causing trees and shrubs around it to smoke. Characters can attempt to quench the flames before they become true blazes, but unless they have a way to do this at range, they'll need to get within 5 feet of the fire specter. Any character that lingers too long near the specter takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) fire damage from its heat. Have characters continue to take fire damage the longer they stay in close proximity to the fire specter.": "提醒玩家，他们的时间是有限的，因为光是幽灵的存在就会使它周围的树木和灌木冒烟。角色可以尝试在火焰变成真正的大火之前将其熄灭，但除非他们有办法在一定范围内做到这一点，否则他们需要进入火幽灵的5英尺之内。任何在幽灵附近逗留过久的角色都会因其热量而受到5（（%0%））的火焰伤害。让角色在火幽灵附近停留的时间越长，就会继续受到火灾伤害。",
	"If a player disturbs the creature in any way or attempts to harm it, it will turn and attack. The fire specter uses the stat block for a {@creature fire elemental}, but it is Medium and has only 51 hit points. The creature can be lured into a nearby clearing to prevent more fires. It will attack ferociously until it has been slain, at which point it will dissolve into smoke and ash.": "如果有玩家以任何方式干扰该生物或试图伤害它，它将转身攻击。火焰幽灵使用的是{@creature fire elemental}的状态块，但它是中型，只有51点命中率。可以将该生物引诱到附近的空地上，以防止发生更多的火灾。它将进行凶猛的攻击，直到被杀死，这时它将化为烟雾和灰烬。",
	"The forest gives way to expansive plains of ash, dotted with the charred husks of petrified trees. The wind here has a heat to it, and it constantly disturbs the ashen soil. As it blows, small embers can be seen forming in the disturbed ash, glowing briefly before being swept up and fading on the wind. This place is clearly unnatural.": "森林让位给广阔的灰烬平原，点缀着石化树木的焦壳。这里的风有一种热量，它不断扰乱灰烬的土壤。在风的吹拂下，可以看到小火苗在被扰动的灰烬中形成，在被风卷起和消逝之前发出短暂的光芒。这个地方显然是不自然的。",
	"Regardless of the route party took, once they arrive at the location described by Tevor they will need to locate the creature that has been preying on the Tenders. A DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check or other tracking skill is needed to follow its trail. On a failure, it takes another day of searching to catch sight of the creature. Optionally, roll on the {@table Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)|Humblewood} table if the party fails to find the {@creature ashsnake|Humblewood}.": "不管队伍走的是什么路线，一旦他们到达泰沃所描述的地点，他们就需要找到那个一直在捕食投标人的生物。需要用DC15智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查或其他追踪技能来追踪它的踪迹。如果失败，则需要再搜寻一天才能看到该生物。可以选择在{@table Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)|Humblewood}表上滚动，如果一行人没能找到{@creature ashsnake|Humblewood}。",

	"Suddenly, you see what looks to be a disturbance in the ashen plains. Something is moving underneath the thick coating of cinders at frightening speeds, churning up burning embers on either side as it goes, before vanishing. Something is here, and it has noticed you.": "突然间，你看到灰烬平原上似乎出现了骚动。有东西在厚厚的煤渣下以可怕的速度移动，一边移动一边搅动两边燃烧的余烬，然后就消失了。有东西在这里，而且它已经注意到了你。",

": "一个类似于巨大的熔化蛇的生物以难以置信的力量打破了灰暗的表面！它的鳞片像木炭一样。它的鳞片就像木炭一样，在鳞片之间，从其熔化的核心发出邪恶的橙色光辉。可以看到这种光芒来自该生物头部的两个点，类似于眼睛，但它是否利用这些眼睛来观察还不清楚。",
	"The ashsnake can feel vibrations within 60 feet of itself, and will attack if it senses movement within range of its bite or constrict attacks. If it senses the party grouping up, it will unleash its breath attack on them. If attacked from outside the range of its {@sense tremorsense|MM}, the ashnake takes an action to determine the direction from which the attack originated.": "灰蛇能感觉到自身60英尺范围内的振动，如果它感觉到在其咬合或收缩攻击范围内的运动，就会进行攻击。如果它感觉到聚会的人在一起，它将对他们释放它的呼吸攻击。如果从它的（%0%）范围之外受到攻击，灰蛇会采取一个行动来确定攻击的来源方向。",
	"During the fight, the ashsnake will try to stay under the ash to protect itself, but it will come up to attack when it senses an opening. Have it burrow or surface to make the fight interesting.": "在战斗中，灰蛇将试图呆在灰下以保护自己，但当它感觉到有空隙时就会上来攻击。让它钻出或浮出水面，使战斗变得有趣。",
	"Here are a few points to remember:": "这里有几个要点需要记住。",
	"The ashsnake will generally surface near characters to try and knock them over with its eruption ability. If anyone falls {@condition prone}, they can expect to have a grab attack launched against them, or a bite attack if the creature is already grappling a character.": "灰蛇一般会在角色附近浮出水面，试图用它的喷发能力将他们击倒。如果有人摔倒（%0%），他们会被抓住攻击，如果该生物已经抓住了一个角色，则会被咬住攻击。",
	"The ashsnake can be attacked while under the ash, although it has a bonus to its armor class (as noted in the monster's description).": "灰蛇在灰烬下可以被攻击，尽管它有一个护甲等级的奖励（在怪物的描述中指出）。",
	"The ashnake can also hide under the ash, but to do this it needs to spend an action making a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check opposed by each character's passive perception score. While hidden in this way the ashsnake is functionally {@condition invisible}, although characters can make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against its initial roll once on their turn (this doesn't cost an action), determining its location on a success. Anytime the ashsnake emerges it is no longer hidden.": "灰蛇也可以隐藏在灰烬之下，但要做到这一点，它需要花一个行动来进行灵巧（（%0%））检查，并与每个角色的被动感知得分相对抗。当以这种方式隐藏时，灰蛇的功能是{@condition invisible}，尽管角色可以在他们的回合中对它的初始卷进行智慧({@skill Perception})检查（这不需要花费行动），在成功后确定它的位置。只要灰蛇出现，它就不会再被隐藏。",
	"The ashsnake can grab characters before burrowing, and can move freely underground with a grappled character in tow. Each time a character starts their turn under the ash they need to hold their breath (which they can do for 1+ their Constitution modifier's worth of minutes before they start to suffocate). This resets every time the creature surfaces, giving the character a chance to gasp for air. If a character cannot hold their breath, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking one level of {@condition exhaustion} on a failure.": "灰蛇可以在钻洞前抓住角色，并且可以在被抓住的角色的牵引下在地下自由移动。每次角色在灰烬下开始他们的回合时，他们需要屏住呼吸（在他们开始窒息之前，他们可以做1+他们的宪法修改器的价值分钟）。每次生物浮出水面时，这都会重置，给角色一个喘息的机会。如果一个角色不能屏住呼吸，他们必须做一个DC 15的宪法救赎动作，如果失败的话，将受到一级（%0%）的影响。",

	"The earth shakes, nearly knocking you and your companions from your feet. All around you ashsnakes erupt through massive mounds of ash. They rear up, emitting a terrifying hiss, a sound so shrill it's as though the air were being rent. As the ashsnakes encircle you, there is a deeper rumble, less violent but full of power. The creatures hesitate for a moment, until another more powerful tremor shakes even their massive bodies. The ashsnakes flee, heading south and burrowing into the ash. The tremors continue to gain in momentum and intensity. To the north, miles away, something gigantic rises from a bed of cinders. First a hill, then a small mountain, releasing a plume of ash that blocks the sun. As the dust clouds settle, you see a huge creature made of craggy black rock and pulsing orange magma. It bellows a guttural sound unlike anything you've ever heard and begins to march toward your position.": "大地震动，几乎把你和你的同伴从你的脚下击倒。你周围的灰蛇在巨大的灰堆中喷发出来。它们抬起头，发出可怕的嘶嘶声，声音如此尖锐，仿佛空气都被撕裂了。当灰蛇包围你时，有一个更深的隆隆声，不那么猛烈，但充满了力量。这些生物犹豫了一会儿，直到另一次更强大的震颤甚至撼动了它们巨大的身体。灰蛇逃走了，往南走，钻进灰烬中。震颤的势头和强度继续增加。在北方，数英里之外，有一个巨大的东西从煤渣床上升起。首先是一座小山，然后是一座小山，释放出一缕灰烬，遮住了太阳。随着尘埃云的平息，你看到一个巨大的生物，由峭壁上的黑色岩石和跳动的橙色岩浆组成。它发出一种不同于你所听到的任何声音，并开始向你的位置行进。",

The stories say that this creature's sole desire is to consume, heedless of the destruction it leaves in its wake. Characters would not know anything more than this.": "{@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood}是一个原始的元素，它的存在本身就充满了愤怒。尽量避免在你的玩家面前称其为 \"火的方面\"，因为这种生物目前还不为他们所知。如果一个角色想进行智力检查，看看他们是否知道它，16分或更高的分数就足以让他们通过稀少的故事和神话听说火的一面。这些故事说，这种生物的唯一愿望就是吞噬，不顾它留下的破坏。人物不会知道比这更多的东西。",
	"The aspect will immediately sense the party of intruders in its Grove, and make for them at full speed. It's obvious from the size and power of this creature that taking it on would be folly. Be sure to communicate this to the players. However, any party member who stays to make a noble sacrifice will surely buy time for their companions to escape.": "这方面会立即感觉到格罗夫的入侵者队伍，并全速赶往他们。从这种生物的体型和力量来看，很明显，对它下手是愚蠢的。一定要把这一点告诉玩家。然而，任何留下来做出崇高牺牲的党员都会为他们的同伴争取到逃跑的时间。",
	"The party can make whatever plans they want, but the shortest distance out of the aspect's path is back into the forest toward Alderheart. Any other path out of the Grove would leave them exposed to the aspect's march or ashsnakes that could be following. The forest canopy should also provide some cover from the creature, making the party difficult to target.": "队伍可以做任何他们想做的计划，但离开这个方面的路径的最短距离是回到森林里，朝向Alderheart。任何其他离开丛林的路径都会让他们暴露在方面的行进中，或者暴露在可能跟随的灰蛇中。森林的树冠也应该提供一些遮蔽物，使他们很难成为目标。",
	"Tevor will flee immediately into the forest, making his escape before the party can react. This is the simplest way to resolve the matter, but if it makes sense within the story, you can have Tevor sacrifice himself to buy the party time to escape, or to save a party member in the following chase sequence.": "泰沃会立即逃进森林，在党员反应过来之前逃走。这是最简单的解决方法，但如果在故事中说得通，你可以让泰沃牺牲自己，为党员争取逃跑的时间，或者在接下来的追逐过程中拯救党员。",
	"Have the players describe how they would make their way to safety. The easiest way to resolve this would be to have each character make a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity ({@skill Athletics}) check to attempt to outrun the aspect. Allow players to make different ability checks if they can come up with a unique way for their characters to escape the threat. For example, distracting the creature might be somewhat of a challenge, requiring a DC 14 Charisma or Intelligence ({@skill Deception}) check, but attempting to restrain it would be more difficult.": "让玩家描述他们将如何到达安全的地方。解决这个问题的最简单的方法是让每个角色做一个DC14力量或灵巧（{@skill Athletics}）的检查，以试图逃出这个方面。如果玩家能想出一个独特的方法让他们的角色逃脱威胁，允许他们进行不同的能力检查。例如，分散怪物的注意力可能是一个挑战，需要进行DC14魅力或智力（（%1%））检查，但试图限制它将更加困难。",
	"Once they have succeeded on the first skill check, have each player make another skill check to determine how successful they are at fleeing as the creature continues to move toward them. Make this check easier or harder depending on how well players did on the first check. If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature's attacks. Particularly dire failures on this check could result in characters falling {@condition prone}.": "一旦他们在第一次技能检查中获得成功，让每个玩家再做一次技能检查，以确定他们在生物继续向他们移动时逃离的成功程度。根据玩家在第一次检查中的表现，使这次检查更容易或更难。如果玩家检查成功，他们的角色就会以足够快的速度逃离，避免进入生物的攻击范围。特别可怕的是，这个检查的失败可能会导致角色坠落（%0%）。",
	"As the aspect marches, it indiscriminately hurls massive boulders of magma and rock into the forest. Characters who failed the second skill check have fallen behind and are in range of these attacks. They must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each round. On a failure, they take 16 ({@dice 3d10}) fire damage. On a success, they take half that damage. They may then attempt another skill or ability check to flee out of the creature's range. As above, be flexible here, and try to reward players for creativity while keeping the threat to their characters believable.": "当这个方面行进时，它不分青红皂白地将岩浆和岩石的巨石扔进森林。没有通过第二次技能检查的角色已经落在后面，处于这些攻击的范围之内。他们必须在每轮开始时做一个DC15的灵巧救赎。如果失败，他们会受到16({@dice 3d10})的火焰伤害。成功的话，他们会受到一半的伤害。然后他们可以尝试另一个技能或能力检查，以逃出该生物的范围。如上所述，在这里要灵活处理，并尽量奖励玩家的创造力，同时保持他们的角色所受到的威胁是可信的。",
	"After about two rounds of pursuit, the characters should notice that the aspect isn't gaining as quickly, and after another round the characters will all have made it out of the creature's range regardless. If any look back, all they will see is an ominous red glow through the trees, and a plume of thick smoke rising up over the horizon. From here the characters are free to make their way safely into the forest and back to Alderheart.": "经过大约两轮的追击，角色们应该注意到这方面的进展没有那么快了，而在另一轮之后，角色们都已经离开了这个生物的范围。如果有人回头看，他们会看到树丛中发出的不祥的红光，以及地平线上升起的一缕浓烟。从这里开始，人物可以自由地安全进入森林，回到Alderheart。",
	"A large part of the forest has been burned away in the wake of the {@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood}, but it seems to have mysteriously given up chase. The party has made it back to the city safely. Having heard and felt the massive aspect's movement, the Council is eager to hear a firsthand account of what happened in the Grove.": "在{@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood}之后，森林的一大部分已经被烧毁，但它似乎已经神秘地放弃了追逐。队伍已经安全地回到了城市。在听到和感受到巨大方面的动向后，议会急于听到关于在丛林中发生的第一手资料。",
	"The Council members accept the news with sadness, anger, concern, and confusion. Whatever this creature is, it represents a threat to all life in the Wood. Many elementals have resided in and around the forest for centuries, but this one harbors a rage that the Council doesn't understand.": "理事会成员以悲伤、愤怒、关切和困惑的心情接受了这个消息。不管这个生物是什么，它代表了对森林中所有生命的威胁。几个世纪以来，许多元素都居住在森林里和周围，但这个元素怀有理事会不理解的愤怒。",
	"A sage looking Council member will mention that she once heard tales of an elemental creature of great size and power called an aspect of fire, but that she hopes this is not the monster they face. Another Council member will mention that the first rule of battle is \"know thine enemy,\" and add that the Dean of the Avium, a sable luma named {@creature Gabe Windsworth|Humblewood}, is incredibly knowledgeable. He may be able to offer some insight on the situation. Council Speaker Bita will agree, and state that should the Dean be unable to assist the party, the Avium is still home to the largest library in the Wood and its tomes may be the party's best chance at finding answers.": "一个看起来很贤惠的理事会成员会提到，她曾经听说过一个巨大的元素生物的故事，叫做火的一面，但她希望这不是他们面对的怪物。另一位理事会成员会提到战斗的第一条规则是 \"了解你的敌人\"，并补充说阿维姆的院长，一个名叫{@creature Gabe Windsworth|Humblewood}的貂皮鲁马，知识非常渊博。他也许能提供一些关于情况的见解。议长比塔会同意，并表示如果院长不能协助党，阿维姆仍然是森林中最大的图书馆所在地，它的书目可能是党找到答案的最好机会。",
	"The Council is interested in any information that can be found regarding this creature. More than that, they would welcome a means of defeating it. In the meantime, they will begin to rally the Perch Guard in case Alderheart should come under threat. The party must now embark on a quest to stop this monster, before it consumes the land.": "理事会对能找到的有关这种生物的任何信息感兴趣。更重要的是，他们将欢迎击败它的方法。同时，他们将开始召集鲈鱼卫队，以防阿尔德心受到威胁。现在，他们必须在这个怪物吞噬这片土地之前，踏上阻止它的征程。",
	"Thick plumes of smoke from the massive blaze the party outran can be seen from Alderheart's canopy, and news of both the awoken creature and the destruction it has wrought spreads through the whole city quickly.": "从阿尔德心的树冠上可以看到大火产生的浓烟，而关于被唤醒的生物和它所造成的破坏的消息也迅速传遍了整个城市。",
	"If Tevor led the party, and returned with them, he will be granted the rank of Summerblossom for his valor. He will head up the effort to quell the forest fires the aspect has started. If he did not return, Havel will lead the relief effort, drawing on the memory of his friend to inspire the crowd, and Tevor will be given a solemn funeral. Either way, many volunteers, both humblefolk and birdfolk, will sign up to help quell the still-raging flames and assist those injured in the blaze. The party can choose whether or not they wish to aid in this effort, but nobody will begrudge them if they need to rest after their ordeal.": "如果泰沃率领队伍，并与他们一起返回，他将因其英勇而被授予夏花的等级。他将领导平息方面引发的森林火灾的工作。如果他没有回来，哈维尔将领导救灾工作，借助对朋友的记忆来激励众人，而泰沃将被给予庄严的葬礼。无论怎样，许多志愿者，包括卑微的人和鸟人，都会报名参加，帮助平息仍然汹涌的火焰，并帮助那些在大火中受伤的人。党员们可以选择是否愿意协助这项工作，但如果他们在经历了苦难之后需要休息，没有人会吝惜他们。",
	"The party will be given a special requisition from the Council to aid in fulfilling their mission to stop the creature. Characters will be able to use this unassuming piece of parchment, stamped with the seal of Alderheart, to requisition up to 500 gp worth of equipment from any shop in the city. This can be used in separate stores, or all at the same place. Likewise, it can be used to pay for a portion of an item, such as a weapon or piece of armor, with the rest needing to be paid in coin.": "队伍将得到一份来自议会的特别请求书，以帮助他们完成阻止怪物的任务。角色将能够使用这张不起眼的羊皮纸，盖上Alderheart的印章，从城市的任何一家商店征用最多价值500gp的装备。这可以在不同的商店使用，也可以在同一地点使用。同样地，它也可以用来支付一件物品的一部分，比如一件武器或一件盔甲，其余的需要用硬币支付。",
	"In order to obtain this discount players must explain how the requisitioned goods will aid them in their mission. Some shopkeepers may require more convincing than others.": "为了获得这一折扣，玩家必须解释所征用的货物将如何帮助他们完成任务。有些店主可能需要比其他人更多的说服力。",
	"The requisition is stamped on the back by a merchant each time it is redeemed, and notarized with the amount it was used for. This can be altered with a difficult skill check using a {@item forgery kit|phb}. However, modifying the document constitutes thievery, and any character caught doing this will be arrested and brought before the Council to face punishment.": "每次兑换时，商人都会在申购单的背面盖上印章，并公证其使用的金额。这可以通过使用{@item forgery kit|phb}的困难技能检查来改变。然而，修改文件构成盗窃，任何被发现这样做的角色将被逮捕，并被带到议会面前接受惩罚。",
	"Characters will also be rewarded with a {@item feathered helm|Humblewood} from the Tenders for their good work. If Tevor awards characters this item, it will come with a gallus feather, given by Havel, to thank the party for helping Tevor return safely.": "角色也会因为他们的良好工作而得到标书人的奖励（%0%）。如果泰沃将此物品奖励给人物，会附带一根哈维尔给的gallus羽毛，以感谢当事人帮助泰沃安全返回。",
	"If Tevor died, have Havel gift them the helm instead. It will contain a luma feather in memory of his lost friend. If the optional variant {@b Paying the Price|hwcs|3|Reaching the Grove} was used for the ashsnake encounter, the Tender the party saved may award them the helm, fitted with an appropriate feather.": "如果泰沃死了，让哈维尔把头盔送给他们。它将包含一根卢玛羽毛，以纪念他失去的朋友。如果在遇到灰蛇时使用了可选的变体（%0%），那么党派所救的驯兽师可以将头盔授予他们，并配上适当的羽毛。",

	"The seal which kept the aspect of fire sleeping beneath the Grove was broken by a corvum mage named {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|Humblewood}. Odwald deeply regrets his actions and blames himself for the spreading wildfires. In his desperation, he has returned to the Avium, where he was once a student, and disguised himself as a librarian in order to access its resources. Out of fear for what might befall the Wood if the aspect is not stopped, Odwald has begun to secretly research the darkest of necromancies. He created a monstrous undead creature known as a {@creature cobblefright|Humblewood}, which he hopes will provide him with the key to stopping the elemental menace once and for all. In so doing, Odwald has placed the Avium in grave danger, for his control of the monster is imperfect. Strange occurrences on campus have aroused the suspicions of a few students and professors that something isn't quite right at the Avium. While the Dean, {@creature Gabe Windsworth|Humblewood}, doesn't yet have any concrete information, he's hoping the party will be able to investigate and help him uncover the mystery. This will lead the way to Odwald and his dangerous scheme.": "让火的一面沉睡在丛林下的封印被一个名叫{@creature Odwald Ebonhart|Humblewood}的科沃姆法师打破。奥德瓦尔德对自己的行为深感后悔，并对不断蔓延的野火感到自责。在绝望中，他回到了他曾经是学生的Avium，并把自己伪装成图书管理员，以获取其资源。出于对如果不阻止方面可能降临森林的恐惧，奥德瓦尔德已经开始秘密研究最黑暗的亡灵法术。他创造了一个被称为{@creature cobblefright|Humblewood}的畸形不死生物，他希望这能为他提供一劳永逸地阻止元素威胁的关键。在这样做的过程中，奥德瓦尔德将Avium置于严重的危险之中，因为他对这个怪物的控制并不完善。校园里发生的奇怪事件引起了一些学生和教授的怀疑，认为阿维姆有些不对劲。虽然院长{@creature Gabe Windsworth|Humblewood}还没有任何具体的信息，但他希望党能够调查并帮助他揭开这个谜团。这将为奥德瓦尔德和他的危险计划指引方向。",
	"Be sure to allow the party some downtime after the events of {@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|hwcs|3} to prepare for the journey to the Avium. The aspect of fire poses a great danger to the Wood, but there's still a good amount of time to deal with the situation. If players feel pressed, have a messenger approach them with a missive from the Council, stating that the aspect hasn't moved from Scorched Grove, according to information obtained from the Alderheart observatory. Scholars cannot make any concrete predictions, but many theorize that the creature may need to remain near an area that is closely tied to elemental fire magic.": "在{@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|hwcs|3}的事件之后，一定要让党有一些停顿时间，为前往阿维姆的旅程做准备。火的方面给森林带来了巨大的危险，但仍有足够的时间来处理这种情况。如果玩家觉得压力很大，可以让一个信使带着议会的信笺接近他们，说明根据从阿尔德心天文台获得的信息，这个方面还没有从焦土林中移走。学者们无法做出任何具体的预测，但许多人推测，这个生物可能需要留在一个与火元素魔法密切相关的区域附近。",
	"The Avium lies to the east of Alderheart. From special observation platforms in the city, the gigantic floating structures of the mage college can be seen rising above the trees of the forest. The College isn't terribly far, but the roadway curves around the eastern forest in order to avoid the dangers which lurk there. This part of Humblewood is known to be a nesting ground for {@creature forest prowler|Humblewood|forest prowlers}, deadly predatory cats that grow leaves and vines on their fur to better blend with their surroundings.": "Avium位于Alderheart的东部。从城市的特殊观察平台上，可以看到法师学院巨大的浮动结构耸立在森林的树木之上。学院并不是很远，但为了避免潜伏在那里的危险，公路在东部森林周围拐了弯。众所周知，汉伯伍德的这一部分是{@creature forest prowler|Humblewood|forest prowlers}的巢穴，这些致命的食肉猫在它们的皮毛上长出树叶和藤蔓，以便更好地与周围环境融合。",
	"Taking the road poses less risk, but it will cost the party three days of travel to reach the Avium. The path through the forest is much more dangerous and harder to navigate, but if the party moves quickly they can cut down their time, making it to the Avium in about two days.": "走路的风险较小，但要花三天的时间才能到达阿维姆。穿过森林的道路更危险，也更难走，但如果队伍行动迅速，他们可以缩短时间，大约两天就能到达阿维姆。",
	"If the party takes the long road around the forest, there are a few ways to handle this. The first and easiest way is to skip to them arriving at the Avium after an uneventful journey. This is useful for speeding up the pace of the game, or if players are itching to get to the next story beat. Be sure to mention things they encountered along the way to provide additional context:": "如果队伍走的是绕过森林的长路，有几种方法可以处理这个问题。第一个也是最简单的方法是跳到他们在经历了一段不顺利的旅程后到达阿维姆。这对加快游戏的节奏很有用，或者如果玩家急于进入下一个故事环节。一定要提到他们在路上遇到的事情，以提供额外的背景。",
	"If the Bandit Coalition was crushed, Humblewood will have an increased presence of Perch Guard forces.

	"If the Bandit Coalition has started to transition into the Wildwood Brigade, the party might see intrepid groups of ex-bandits turned rangers. These individuals may be helping escort supply trains and refugees to prepared camps where food, shelter, and medical supplies are available. It seems like everyone is doing their part to keep the Wood together in these trying times.": "如果强盗联盟已经开始向野蛮人大队过渡，党派可能会看到无畏的前强盗群体转为护林员。这些人可能正在帮助护送补给列车和难民到准备好的营地，那里有食物、住所和医疗用品。看起来每个人都在尽自己的努力，在这个艰难的时期保持森林的团结。",
	"If the party enjoys travel time and random adventures on the road, use the {@table Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|Humblewood} table to decide what they encounter. For each day of travel, roll a {@dice d20}, and on a roll of 5 or lower, roll on the encounter table to see what happens. Some of these fights might be easy for a party of level 4 adventurers, so more enemies can be added to provide a greater challenge.": "如果党派喜欢旅行时间和路上的随机冒险，就用（%0%）表来决定他们遇到什么。在每一天的旅行中，掷出（%1%），在掷出5或更低时，在遭遇表上掷出，看看会发生什么。其中一些战斗对于4级的冒险者队伍来说可能很容易，所以可以增加更多的敌人来提供更大的挑战。",
	"Not every bandit shares Benna's idealism. A few bad seeds will either use her death as an opportunity to promote themselves, or they'll balk at the idea of a reformed Coalition and splinter off into disparate groups. Use this optional encounter to add danger to the route, and help illustrate the new threats that have risen in the wake of the Coalition's destruction or transformation.": "并非每个强盗都有本娜的理想主义。有几个坏蛋要么利用她的死亡作为提升自己的机会，要么对改革后的联盟的想法嗤之以鼻，分裂成不同的团体。使用这个可选的遭遇来增加路线的危险性，并帮助说明在联盟被摧毁或转型后出现的新威胁。",
	"These new bandits are no better than raiders, and they prey on humblefolk and birdfolk alike. Among the strongest are forces led by a mapach known as {@creature Krall, the Scavenger King|Humblewood}. After hearing news of the party traveling through his territory, Krall is interested in cementing his reputation among the remaining raider factions by taking down the adventurers who either killed or turned Benna.": "这些新的强盗比强盗好不了多少，他们对卑贱的人和鸟人都是猎物。其中最强大的是由一个被称为（%0%）的马帕奇领导的部队。在听到队伍穿越他的领地的消息后，克拉尔有兴趣通过拿下杀死或策反本娜的冒险者来巩固他在剩余的强盗派别中的声誉。",

	"As the party approaches Krall's trap, the forest seems eerily quiet. Something is amiss. The bandits are well-hidden in the dark undergrowth, so rather than using passive perception, have each character make a DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot the ambush. If anyone fails this check, they will spend their first round surprised. Read the following:": "当队伍接近克拉尔的陷阱时，森林似乎安静得可怕。有些事情是不对劲的。匪徒很好地隐藏在黑暗的树丛中，所以与其使用被动感知，不如让每个角色进行DC 16智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，以发现埋伏。如果有人没有通过这个检查，他们将在第一轮中感到惊讶。阅读以下内容。",
	"You see a burly mapach with matted fur, missing in patches, sitting on the road ahead, casually picking his teeth with a long, pointed dagger. He wears studded leather armor and has a rapier sheathed at his hip. He eyes you maliciously as you approach, standing to reveal that he is nearly six feet tall. \"Well well, if it isn't Alderheart's lackeys.\"": "你看到一个魁梧的马帕奇，毛发枯黄，缺了几块，坐在前面的路上，用一把长而尖的匕首随意地剔着牙。他穿着带钉子的皮甲，胯下有一把出鞘的剑。当你走近时，他恶狠狠地盯着你，站起来后发现他差不多有六英尺高。\"好啊好啊，这不是阿尔德心的奴才吗？\"",
	"Krall immediately attacks with his force. The thief supports him in melee combat while his priest and the two mapach bandits stay in the forest and attack the party at range. Krall will order Shyla to heal him if he is wounded, but otherwise she is free to attack using her own judgement, and support the bandits with her spells as needed.": "克拉尔立即用他的力量进行攻击。盗贼在近战中支持他，而他的牧师和两个马帕奇强盗则留在森林里，在范围内攻击对方。如果他受伤了，克拉尔会命令希拉为他疗伤，除此之外，她可以根据自己的判断自由攻击，并根据需要用法术支持强盗们。",

	"This is a challenging fight, and if it looks like the party is having trouble add some wandering Perch Guard NPCs to aid them. A force of three birdfolk skirmishers should turn the tide in the party's favor, but the guards will be focused on defending the party and won't pursue Krall into the forest if he makes a run for it. Perch Guard forces should also come to chase off Krall if he's victorious, though he won't stick around for too long.": "这是一场具有挑战性的战斗，如果看起来队伍有困难的话，可以增加一些流浪的栖息地守卫NPC来帮助他们。一支由三个鸟人组成的小兵部队应该会使局势对党派有利，但卫兵们会专注于保卫党派，如果克拉尔跑了，他们不会追到森林里去。如果克拉尔取得了胜利，鲈鱼卫队也应该来追赶他，不过他不会在这里停留太久。",
	"If Krall wins, he'll settle for humiliating the heroes by stealing something of value from each party member. Retrieving these items could be the basis of a whole side adventure all its own.": "如果克拉尔赢了，他就会通过从每个党员身上偷取有价值的东西来羞辱英雄们。夺回这些物品可以成为一个完整的侧面冒险的基础。",
	"Krall seeks revenge, but he isn't so foolhardy as to risk death here. If the party seems amenable, he'll beg for mercy and turn himself in. He has connections in Alderheart's criminal underbelly, and he would rather be imprisoned than dead. If the party doesn't seem like the merciful sort, Krall will order his forces to scatter into the forest when things look grim. Once he enters the forest, the party has only 2 rounds to capture him before he leads his pursuers into a prepared escape burrow where he will pull a lever which snaps a wooden portcullis over the entrance. The portcullis can be broken by spending an action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check, but in this time Krall will already have traveled down one of the many branching pathways of the tunnel and made a clean getaway. His followers don't know about the escape burrow, and they can be easily captured. Krall won't hesitate to cut them loose to save himself.": "克拉尔寻求复仇，但他还没有愚蠢到在这里冒死。如果对方看起来很顺从，他就会求饶并自首。他在阿尔德心的犯罪组织中有关系，他宁愿被监禁也不愿意死。如果党派不像是那种仁慈的人，当事情看起来很糟糕时，Krall会命令他的部队分散到森林里。一旦他进入森林，在他带领追兵进入一个准备好的逃生洞穴之前，党派只有2个回合的时间来抓捕他，在那里他将拉动一个杠杆，使入口处的木制舷窗扣上。花一个行动并通过DC15力量检查成功后，可以打破这个门闩，但是在这段时间里，克拉尔已经沿着隧道的许多分支通道走了，并顺利地逃走了。他的追随者不知道这个逃跑的洞穴，他们很容易被抓住。克拉尔会毫不犹豫地把他们放走以拯救自己。",
	"If any Perch Guard came to offer assistance, those remaining will sound a horn, calling on reinforcements that will arrive in the next few minutes. This will include combat medics who can help tend to the party's wounds. The Perch Guard have orders to take a share of any treasure recovered from either Krall or his bandits back to Alderheart. However, the Guard appreciates the party's service to the Wood and will look the other way if the party decides to take the treasure for themselves.": "如果有任何鲈鱼卫士前来提供援助，剩下的人将吹响号角，呼吁援军在接下来的几分钟内到达。这其中包括可以帮助处理党的伤口的战斗医务人员。栖息地卫队奉命将从克拉尔或他的强盗身上搜出的财宝分给阿尔德心。然而，卫兵们感谢党对森林的服务，如果党决定将财宝据为己有，他们会睁一只眼闭一只眼。",

	"The forest may be a quicker route to the Avium, but progress is slow in the dense undergrowth. This part of the forest is ancient, and its floor is a thick carpet of ferns, moss, and other plant life. Treat all areas in this forest that are not clearings or groves as difficult terrain, unless the party does something about it. Spells that deal fire or acid damage can remove the difficult terrain from target areas. Characters can also choose to climb up the branches and travel via gliding if they are birdfolk, completely bypassing the difficult terrain. The forest is thick enough that anyone up at least 30 feet in the giant trees will have an easy time finding branches in gliding range, allowing them to make progress at normal speed, or scout ahead with ease if they so desire.": "森林可能是通往阿维姆的较快路线，但在茂密的树丛中进展缓慢。这片森林是古老的，其地面是厚厚的蕨类、苔藓和其他植物的地毯。这片森林中所有不是空地或树林的地方都被视为困难的地形，除非当事人对此有所行动。造成火或酸伤害的法术可以消除目标区域的困难地形。如果角色是鸟人，他们也可以选择爬上树枝，通过滑翔来旅行，完全绕过困难地形。这片森林足够茂密，任何在巨树上至少30英尺的人都很容易找到滑翔范围内的树枝，使他们能够以正常速度前进，或者如果他们愿意，可以轻松地侦察前方。",
	"Gigantic 60-foot-tall trees form a canopy that significantly weakens incoming sunlight, and only dim light filters down from above. It's easy to hide here, and cover is readily available behind the trunks of the giant trees. Even with a map, there are no recognizable landmarks, and it doesn't take much for travelers to become disoriented. At least one character must lead the group, succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check every four hours of travel to avoid getting lost. Getting lost means the party must spend another hour wandering off-course before they can correct their course. Each time the party fails one of these checks, roll on the {@table Ancient Forest Encounters|Humblewood} table to see what they encounter in their wanderings.": "60英尺高的巨树形成一个树冠，大大削弱了射入的阳光，只有昏暗的光线从上面过滤下来。在这里很容易藏身，而且在巨树的树干后面很容易找到掩护。即使有地图，这里也没有可识别的地标，旅行者不需要太多时间就会迷失方向。至少有一个角色必须带领队伍，每行进四小时就进行一次DC15智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查以避免迷路。迷路意味着队伍必须在纠正路线之前再花一个小时游荡。每当队伍在这些检查中失败一次，就在{@table Ancient Forest Encounters|Humblewood}表上滚动，看看他们在游荡中遇到了什么。",
	"The party will eventually encounter the {@creature forest prowler|Humblewood} that has been nesting in the area for the last month. It makes its home in the treetops in well-camouflaged nests made from leaves and branches. A sure way to tell a prowler's nest from a giant bird's is the stench of meat. Prowlers keep carrion from the animals they hunt, usually giant elk or boars, on nearby branches as a source of food.": "队伍最终会遇到上个月一直在这里筑巢的（%0%）。它把家安在树梢上，在用树叶和树枝做的伪装良好的巢里。区分徘徊者的巢和巨鸟的巢的一个可靠方法是肉的臭味。徘徊者把它们猎杀的动物（通常是巨型麋鹿或野猪）的腐肉放在附近的树枝上，作为食物来源。",
	"This encounter should happen towards the end of the party's journey through the forest. The characters could come across the prowler's lair mere hours from the forest's end, or the beast could ambush them as they camp for the night. As long as the party keeps moving in a stealthy manner, they will elude the beast, but if they stay camped in one spot for more than an hour the forest prowler will be alerted to their presence.": "这个遭遇应该发生在队伍在森林中的旅程结束时。角色们可能会在离森林尽头仅几小时的地方遇到徘徊者的巢穴，也可能在他们扎营过夜时被野兽伏击。只要一行人保持隐蔽的行动，他们就能躲开野兽，但如果他们在一个地方扎营超过一个小时，森林巡游者就会被惊动。",
	"However the encounter happens, the prowler will study the party from a distance first, biding its time as they move through its territory. It will attempt to use its stealth to approach the party quietly, and will single out the smallest and most vulnerable character among the group as its prey. The prowler hunts through hit-and-run tactics, disappearing into the foliage with its camouflaging fur before pouncing again on unsuspecting foes. The prowler's incredible claws give it a solid grip on tree trunks, and it can climb even the highest branches with ease. Once it begins its assault it won't stop until it has scored a kill, or has been critically wounded.": "无论遭遇如何，徘徊者会先从远处研究队伍，在他们穿过其领地时等待时机。它将试图利用它的隐蔽性来悄悄地接近队伍，并将队伍中最小的和最脆弱的角色作为它的猎物。徘徊者通过打了就跑的战术进行狩猎，用它的伪装毛皮消失在树叶中，然后再扑向毫无防备的敌人。徘徊者令人难以置信的爪子使它能够牢牢抓住树干，甚至可以轻松地爬上最高的树枝。一旦它开始攻击，它就不会停止，直到它杀了人，或者受了重伤。",
	"After the party has either made their way through the forest or reached the end of the road, they will arrive at the Avium, the magical college of the birdfolk. Here arcane spellcasters from all over Humblewood study, decipher mystic secrets, and teach the next generation their craft.": "在队伍穿过森林或到达路的尽头后，他们将到达鸟人的魔法学院--Avium。在这里，来自汉伯伍德各地的奥术施法者学习，破译神秘的秘密，并教导下一代人他们的技艺。",
	"Throughout most of this part, Odwald Ebonhart has assumed the identity of the librarian Mordane Swiftgale. To avoid confusion, the person the players know as Mordane will be referred to in this text as Odwald. This ensures that it is clear when reading this part that certain events do not involve the real Mordane. Be cautious when GMing, and refer to the disguised Odwald only as Mordane until Odwald's true identity has been revealed.": "在这一部分的大部分时间里，奥德瓦尔德-埃邦哈特都是以图书管理员莫丹-斯威夫盖尔的身份出现的。为了避免混淆，玩家所知道的莫丹在本文中会被称为奥德瓦尔德。这可以确保在阅读这部分内容时清楚地知道，某些事件并不涉及真正的莫丹。在做GM的时候要谨慎，在Odwald的真实身份被揭露之前，只把伪装的Odwald称为Mordane。",
	"At the heart of the Avium is a mystery the players will need to solve. The party's suspicions should be aroused when they start their research and realize much of the information they require is missing. In most cases, books have had pages torn out. The tomes were vandalized by Odwald while in a frantic state, before he took {@creature Mordane Swiftgale|Humblewood} hostage and assumed his appearance.": "在Avium的核心是一个玩家需要解决的谜团。当他们开始研究时，发现他们所需要的许多信息都不见了，这应该引起他们的怀疑。在大多数情况下，书籍都被撕掉了几页。这些书籍是奥德瓦尔德在疯狂的状态下破坏的，在他把{@creature Mordane Swiftgale|Humblewood}作为人质并装扮成他的样子之前。",
	"As Librarian Swiftgale, Odwald now has access to all of the highly regulated books in a part of the College known as the lower library (see {@adventure Into the Library|hwcs|4|Into the Library}).

	"During his research, Odwald has uncovered a frightening truth: the aspect of fire is immortal, its energies have seeped into the Scorched Grove over centuries, creating a well of power it can use to reconstruct its form if it is ever destroyed. However, evidence of his earlier panicked search still remains, and Odwald worries that the heroes may use it to expose him.": "在研究过程中，奥德瓦尔德发现了一个可怕的事实：火的方面是不朽的，它的能量在几个世纪以来渗入了焦土丛林，创造了一个力量之井，如果它被摧毁，它可以用来重建它的形式。然而，他先前惊慌失措地寻找的证据仍然存在，奥德瓦尔德担心英雄们会利用它来暴露他。",
	"The torn-out pages contain information necessary for the party to defeat the aspect of fire, but the players won't be able to find this out until they discover Odwald's secret chamber in the library, where he has been using the information he stole to plan a way to kill the aspect. Odwald has been dabbling in dangerous necromancy, and he's created a {@creature cobblefright|Humblewood} to aid in his research, seeking to study its soul siphon ability in order to recreate the effect as a large-scale spell. If it works, such a spell might drain the vital energies that make the aspect immortal, ending its threat to the Wood once and for all. The cobblefright is a threat to all who currently live and study in the Avium, and the party will need to uncover Odwald's secret laboratory and dangerous monster before he loses control of his creation.": "这些被撕掉的书页包含了玩家打败火的一面所必需的信息，但玩家在发现奥德瓦尔德在图书馆的密室之前是无法发现的，他一直在用他偷来的信息来计划杀死火的一面。奥德瓦尔德一直在涉足危险的死灵法术，他创造了一个{@creature cobblefright|Humblewood}来帮助他的研究，试图研究它的灵魂虹吸能力，以便将这种效果作为一个大规模的法术重新创造。如果成功的话，这样的法术可能会耗尽使该方面不朽的重要能量，彻底结束它对森林的威胁。鹅卵石恐惧症对所有目前在阿维姆生活和学习的人都是一种威胁，党派将需要在奥德瓦尔德失去对其创造物的控制之前揭开他的秘密实验室和危险的怪物。",
	"There are many pathways players can follow throughout this investigation, and many ways for the party to come across important information. The party doesn't need to know everything to find out the location of Odwald's lair, but the more they know, the more complete their picture of the happenings at the Avium will be. Because there are many connections players can make between different leads, clues, and avenues of investigation, some sections will cross-reference others that might be relevant.": "在整个调查过程中，玩家有很多途径可以选择，也有很多方法可以让玩家接触到重要的信息。玩家不需要知道所有的事情来找出奥德瓦尔德的巢穴，但是他们知道的越多，他们对Avium所发生的事情就越完整。因为玩家可以在不同的线索、线索和调查途径之间建立许多联系，有些部分会交叉引用其他可能相关的内容。",
	"If the players are lost or unsure where to go, an NPC can deliver one or more of the following hints to move the narrative along:": "如果玩家迷路或不确定要去哪里，NPC可以提供以下一个或多个提示来推动叙事。",
	"Only faculty members have access to tomes dealing with high-level or forbidden magic, and even then it's solely intended for research purposes. Removing one of these dangerous books from the lower library, or practicing the knowledge they contain, is grounds for termination from the Avium.": "只有教职员工才能接触到涉及高级或禁忌魔法的书籍，即便如此，也只是为了研究目的。从下层图书馆拿走这些危险的书，或者练习它们所包含的知识，都会被终止在Avium的资格。",

	"Four gigantic circular stone platforms float alongside several towers and spires in the air above you. These structures slowly rotate around a leafless and branchless tree trunk made from solid stone. The trunk towers hundreds of feet high, and the orbiting structures appear to connect to stone bridges which jut out of the trunk near its upper levels. You see two Perch Guards in crenellated watch posts above the entryway to this petrified trunk. They greet you, and moments later a robed, bespectacled raptor glides down to land at your feet.": "四个巨大的圆形石台与几个塔楼和尖顶一起漂浮在你上方的空中。这些结构围绕着一棵无叶无枝的树干缓慢地旋转，这棵树是由坚固的石头制成的。树干高达数百英尺，轨道结构似乎与树干上层附近伸出的石桥相连。你看到在这个石化树干的入口处，有两个在石榴裙下的哨所里的鲈鱼卫士。他们向你打招呼，一会儿，一只身穿长袍、面带微笑的猛禽滑翔下来，落在你的脚下。",
	"The raptor is an associate professor named {@creature Rhys Birchwalker|Humblewood}, who has been sent to greet the party. She explains the Dean is expecting them, and then leads the party to the large central gate, which appears to be the only entrance into the structure. She withdraws a an amulet with the Avium's crest upon it from the folds of her robe and presents it to the giant wooden double doors. After a brief moment the same symbol etches itself in light across the entrance. Then, with a heavy creak, the doors begin to part, revealing an interior lounge.": "这只猛禽是一位名叫（%0%）的副教授，她被派来迎接这一行人。她解释说院长在等他们，然后把他们带到中央大门前，这似乎是进入该建筑的唯一入口。她从袍子的褶皱中取出一个印有阿维姆徽章的护身符，并将它放在巨大的木制双门前。短暂的片刻之后，同样的符号在入口处的光线中刻下了自己。然后，随着一声沉重的吱吱声，门开始分开，露出了内部的休息室。",
	"A main desk sits near the far wall, behind which a scribe is busy with tottering piles of paper. Several chairs and couches are situated around circular tables throughout the room, which is lit comfortably by floating braisers containing magical flames. Portraits of wizened birdfolk hang from the walls, each one wearing robes similar to those of your attendant.": "一张主桌靠近远处的墙壁，后面的抄写员正忙着处理成堆的纸张。房间里有几张椅子和沙发，围绕着圆形的桌子，房间里有漂浮的钎子，里面有神奇的火焰，照得很舒服。墙上挂着老练的鸟人的画像，每个人都穿着与你的侍者相似的长袍。",
	"Behind the main desk is a spiral staircase that leads down. The staircase is flanked by a pair of large birdfolk statues, one of which bears the likeness of a corvum whose portrait hangs from the west wall. Opposite this staircase, a circular platform rests in its own cylindrical alcove.": "主桌后面是一个螺旋形的楼梯，一直向下。楼梯两侧是一对大型鸟人雕像，其中一个雕像上有一个科沃姆的肖像，其肖像挂在西墙上。在这个楼梯的对面，一个圆形的平台停在它自己的圆柱形凹槽里。",
	"Professor Birchwalker leads the party onto the circular platform and utters an incantation, which causes the entire stone disk to rise from the ground and propel the group upwards through the tree trunk. A few windows occasionally zip by on the way up, showing glimpses of the Wood and just how high the party is traveling. The platform stops halfway up the structure, and the party finds themselves in an area next to a busy atrium. Following Professor Birchwalker, everyone arrives at the Dean's office.": "伯奇沃克教授带领大家走上圆形平台，并念了一段咒语，使整个石盘从地面升起，推动大家穿过树干向上攀升。在上升的过程中，偶尔会有几扇窗子滑过，让人看到树林的一角，以及队伍正在行驶的高度。平台在结构的一半处停了下来，大家发现自己在一个繁忙的中庭旁边的区域。跟着伯克沃克教授，大家来到了院长的办公室。",
	"You and your companions enter into a round stone office. It is surrounded on all sides by windows, through which several spires and large circular terrariums can be observed slowly floating by. The many tables inside the office are filled with disorganized piles of books, and the desk is in a similar state of disorder. A sable luma peeks up from over the books. \"Oh, please excuse me! I'm reviewing a few... hundred theses for my students. Excellent work! But, one does tend to lose track of time. I'm terribly sorry.\"": "你和你的同伴们进入了一个圆形的石头办公室。它的四面都是窗户，透过窗户可以观察到几个尖顶和大的圆形陶罐慢慢飘过。办公室内的许多桌子上堆满了杂乱无章的书籍，而办公桌也处于类似的无序状态。一个貂皮鲁马从书本上方探出头来。\"哦，请原谅我！我正在审查一些... 我正在为我的学生审查几篇......百篇论文。优秀的工作! 但是，人确实容易忘记时间。我非常抱歉。\"",
	"The luma is {@creature Gabe Windsworth|Humblewood}, the Dean of the Avium. He will apologize profusely and clear a few tomes off his desk before moving to give each party member a firm handshake and an official welcome to his College. The Dean will then cut right to the chase: he knows why the party is here and what they've come for, thanks to messages from the Council. He is eager to help them find whatever they need to stop the aspect of fire. The Dean will tell the party:": "这位卢马是{@creature Gabe Windsworth|Humblewood}，Avium的院长。他将深表歉意，并清理桌上的几本书籍，然后向每一位党员致以坚定的握手，正式欢迎他们来到他的学院。然后院长将直奔主题：他知道这群人为什么会在这里，以及他们来这里的目的，这要感谢理事会的信息。他渴望帮助他们找到任何他们需要的东西，以阻止火灾的发生。院长会告诉他们。",
	"\"You won't find information on something that old and powerful in just any library. Thankfully, the Avium was built upon the greatest store of knowledge in all of Humblewood... literally! Beneath the main building is the oldest structure here, a library with a collection of tomes, folios, and manuscripts gathered from all over Everden. With any luck, that's where you'll find what you're looking for. Now, a disclaimer—some of the tomes in there are a little... uh, deadly. But worry not, our librarians are experts. They'll help point you in the right direction while steering you clear of the more... ‘advanced' materials.\"": "\"你不会在任何图书馆里找到关于这么古老和强大的东西的信息。值得庆幸的是，Avium是建立在整个汉伯伍德最伟大的知识库之上的......真的！\"。在主楼下面是这里最古老的建筑，是一个图书馆，收藏着从埃弗顿各地收集来的书籍、对开本和手稿。如果运气好的话，你会在那里找到你要找的东西。现在，免责声明--那里的一些书籍有点......呃，致命的。但不用担心，我们的图书管理员是专家。他们会帮助你指出正确的方向，同时引导你避开更多的...... \"高级 \"材料。高级 \"材料。\"",
	"He will then give each of the characters a small amulet with the insignia of the Avium. These appear to be of lesser quality than Professor Birchwalker's, and Dean Windsworth will inform the party that these are amulets, made especially for guest researchers. The party will then be free to roam the grounds.": "然后他将给每个人物一个带有阿维姆徽章的小护身符。这些护身符的质量似乎不如伯克沃克教授的护身符，温兹沃思院长会告诉大家，这些护身符是专门为客座研究员制作的。然后一行人就可以在院子里自由活动了。",
	"The Dean knows the importance of their mission, but he also knows they've had a long journey. The amulets will give the party access to dormitory chambers that have been prepared specifically for them. The room will have exactly the right number of bunkbeds for the playgroup. The party won't need to worry about food either, as their guest amulets grant them free meals at the campus dining hall. Characters are also free to sit in on any lectures they wish to attend around campus, as well as to peruse the more conventional libraries housed in the orbiting structures.": "院长知道他们任务的重要性，但他也知道他们经历了漫长的旅程。这些护身符会让他们进入专门为他们准备的宿舍房间。房间里的双层床的数量正好适合游戏小组使用。派对也不需要担心食物问题，因为他们的客人护身符可以让他们在校园食堂免费用餐。角色们还可以自由地旁听他们想在校园内参加的任何讲座，以及浏览设在轨道结构中的更传统的图书馆。",
	"Refer to Fig. 4.1 for a map of the Avium.": "请参阅图4.1，了解Avium的地图。",
	"At the heart of the Avium is the central building, made from the trunk of a petrified tree. It is orbited by four terrariums and a dozen or so smaller towers. Each structure which orbits the trunk does so at varying heights and speeds, between one rotation every 10 minutes, and one rotation every half hour.": "Avium的核心是中央建筑，由一棵石化的树干制成。它的周围有四座日光浴室和十几座小塔。每个围绕树干运行的结构都有不同的高度和速度，从每10分钟旋转一次到每半小时旋转一次。",
	"The orbiting structures each have gliding platforms and moveable bridges, which correspond with bridge sections on other structures and connect at regular intervals to form complete overpasses. These structures stay aligned for 10 minutes, allowing for crossing by foot. For humblefolk students, knowing when to cross can make the difference between missing a class and arriving on time. But for birdfolk, the entire aerial campus can be traversed with ease. If ever in doubt about how long it will take for the route to an orbiting structure to connect, roll {@dice 3d10} and use that number in minutes to decide when the next favorable rotation will be.": "每个轨道结构都有滑行平台和可移动的桥梁，它们与其他结构上的桥梁部分相对应，并以固定的间隔连接，形成完整的立交桥。这些结构在10分钟内保持一致，允许步行穿越。对于卑微的学生来说，知道什么时候过桥可以使他们在错过一堂课和准时到达之间做出选择。但是对于鸟人来说，整个空中校园都可以轻松穿越。如果对通往轨道结构的路线需要多长时间连接有疑问，可以滚动（%0%），用这个数字来决定下一次有利的旋转时间。",
	"There are many places in the Avium for characters to explore, and characters can spend their time here however they wish. Those who so desire can learn new spells or concoct potions. To track the party's activities, let the players know that each day they spend in the Avium consists of eight hours within which they can benefit from all the College has to offer. After this time, several campus areas close their doors to students, and only those with special faculty amulets can get past security. Studying at the College can grant one of the following benefits:": "Avium里有很多地方可以供人物探索，人物可以在这里随心所欲地度过他们的时间。那些有此愿望的人可以学习新的法术或炼制药水。为了跟踪队伍的活动，让玩家知道他们在Avium度过的每一天都有8个小时，在这8个小时里他们可以从学院提供的所有东西中获益。过了这个时间，几个校园区域就会对学生关闭大门，只有那些拥有特殊教员护身符的学生才能通过保安。在学院学习可以获得以下好处之一。",
	"Wizards who study here can add any spell on the wizard's spell list to their spellbook, but they still require the necessary amount of coin and time to do this. Spells are only granted to wizards deemed worthy of their power, meaning only spells of a level the wizard could cast will be made available.": "在这里学习的巫师可以将巫师的法术清单上的任何法术添加到他们的法术书中，但他们仍然需要必要的硬币和时间来做这件事。法术只授予被认为配得上其力量的巫师，这意味着只有巫师可以施展的水平的法术才会被提供。",
	"By spending a full day studying and practicing, any bard, ranger, sorcerer or warlock can swap one spell they have learned previously for another of the same level that is on their class spell list.": "通过花一整天的时间学习和练习，任何吟游诗人、游侠、巫师或术士都可以将他们之前学过的一个法术换成他们等级法术列表中的另一个同等级法术。",
	"Additionally, any character proficient with a {@item herbalism kit|phb} can avail themselves of the campus potions laboratory, which stocks reagents needed for potion making. Creating a potion can be done for the normal cost (to help cover the expenses associated with growing so many magical herbs) and only takes one day of brewing instead of the normal amount of time it would take to craft such an item.": "此外，任何精通{@item herbalism kit|phb}的角色都可以利用校园里的药水实验室，那里有制作药水所需的试剂。制造一种药水可以用正常的成本来完成（以帮助支付与种植如此多的魔法草药有关的费用），而且只需要一天的酿造时间，而不是制作这种物品所需的正常时间。",
	"Faculty offices, most lecture halls, the large communal dining hall, and the infirmary are all located in the central building. A Perch Guard station near the middle of the central building serves as the headquarters for campus security forces. Servitor skeletons can often be found here, performing janitorial tasks.": "学院办公室、大多数演讲厅、大型公共食堂和医务室都位于中央大楼内。靠近中央大楼中间的一个栖息地警卫站是校园保安部队的总部。这里经常可以找到仆人的骸骨，执行清洁任务。",
	"The four terrariums are circular stone structures with bowl-shaped bottoms and mostly flat surfaces. They are contained in magical spherical fields, which allow matter to pass through, but are designed to shield and contain magical blasts. This keeps the surrounding structures safe in case of an accident. Three of the terrariums are 200 feet in diameter. They contain different biomes and are used for natural research. The fourth is smaller, only 100 feet across, and is located higher up. It houses a security building, as well as a gaol, both overseen by the Perch Guard.": "四个陶罐是圆形的石头结构，底部呈碗状，表面大多是平的。它们被包含在神奇的球形领域中，允许物质通过，但被设计用来屏蔽和遏制魔法爆炸。这使周围的结构在发生事故时保持安全。其中三个陶罐的直径为200英尺。它们包含不同的生物群落，用于自然研究。第四个比较小，只有100英尺宽，位于更高的地方。它包含一个安全建筑，以及一个监狱，都由栖息地警卫队监督。",
	"The floating towers are between 40 to 80 feet across, and they are the oldest structures orbiting the central tree. Some house libraries and small classrooms on niche subjects, mostly for advanced students of a particular school of magic. Other towers contain laboratories for practicing spellcraft, testing established arcane theorems, and brewing potions.": "浮动塔的宽度在40到80英尺之间，它们是围绕中心树运行的最古老的结构。有些是图书馆和小教室，主要是为某一魔法学校的高级学生准备的。其他的塔楼包含用于练习法术、测试既定的奥术定理和酿造药水的实验室。",
	"Located high in the Avium's structure, this large office belongs to Dean Windsworth. More than just his private study, it is a historical part of the building, having been used by every headmaster of the Avium since the College's founding. Dean Windsworth can often be found here poring over documents.": "这间大办公室位于Avium结构的高处，属于Windsworth院长。它不仅仅是他的私人书房，也是建筑的一个历史部分，自学院成立以来，Avium的每一位校长都曾使用过。经常可以看到温兹沃斯院长在这里翻阅文件。",
	"The central building houses dormitories for students and faculty. The student rooms are near the lower part of the tree, and are divided by an individual's standing within the Avium, with those in their first year having rooms closer to the ground. The faculty dorms rest above these, in areas off limits to students.": "中央建筑是学生和教师的宿舍。学生的房间靠近树的下部，按个人在Avium中的地位划分，第一年的学生的房间更靠近地面。教职员工的宿舍就在这些房间上面，在学生不能进入的地方。",
	"The lower library consists of a series of rooms and corridors, shaped from inside the tree's stone roots. Unlike many of the classrooms in the central building, which have been remodeled, much of the lower library remains unchanged since the days of the Avium's founding. It contains the most dangerous and rare books in the Avium, and only high ranking faculty members and a few special guest researchers are privy to the contents within. The sturdy stone shelves here are molded from the same stone that makes up the floor. They tower with books and require little in the way of care beyond dusting (though some sections are clearly overdue for it).": "下层图书馆由一系列的房间和走廊组成，是由树的石根内部塑造的。与中央大楼的许多教室不同的是，下层图书馆的大部分内容自阿维姆大学成立以来一直没有改变。它包含了Avium中最危险和最罕见的书籍，只有高级别的教员和一些特殊的客座研究人员才能看到里面的内容。这里坚固的石质书架是由构成地板的相同石头铸成的。书架上堆满了书籍，除了除尘之外，几乎不需要其他照顾（尽管有些部分显然已经过期）。",
	"The staircase near the entrance leads down to the lower library. This area is only accessible to those with the appropriate pass, at appropriate times of day. If the party attempts to descend the stairs without their guest amulets or outside of normal hours, the two {@creature stone golem|mm|stone golems} that guard the entrance (the birdfolk statues on either side of the stairway) will come to life and attempt to stop them. The golems seek only to restrain the party until Perch Guard authorities arrive. If the party attempts combat, the golems will defend themselves, but they will strike with calculated force. Any character reduced to 0 hit points by the golems will remain stable, since the sentries are under strict commands to incapacitate intruders, not kill them.": "入口附近的楼梯通往下层图书馆。这个区域只有持有相应通行证的人才能在一天中的适当时间进入。如果一行人试图在没有客人护身符的情况下或在正常时间之外下楼，守卫入口的两个（%0%）（楼梯两边的鸟人雕像）就会复活并试图阻止他们。妖怪们只想在栖息地守卫机构到达之前限制住队伍。如果队伍试图战斗，地精会自我防卫，但它们会以有计划的力量攻击。任何被格斗士降低到0命中率的角色都会保持稳定，因为哨兵受到严格的命令，要使入侵者丧失能力，而不是杀死他们。",
	"As characters enter the lower library they will be greeted by the librarian, Mordane Swiftgale, who is actually Odwald Ebonhart in disguise. This is a magical effect produced by a specially crafted pendant that Odwald wears, and as long as he (or anyone else) wears it, they will look and sound exactly like Mordane Swiftgale. This is a transmutation effect, although it has been supplemented with illusion spells so as not to appear magical when examined with {@spell detect magic} or similar effects.": "当人物进入下层图书馆时，他们会受到图书管理员Mordane Swiftgale的欢迎，他实际上是Odwald Ebonhart的伪装。这是由奥德瓦尔德佩戴的一个特别制作的吊坠产生的神奇效果，只要他（或其他人）佩戴了这个吊坠，他们就会看起来和听起来都和莫丹-斯威夫特盖尔完全一样。这是一种转化效果，尽管它已经用幻觉法术进行了补充，以便在用{@spell detect magic}或类似效果检查时不会显得很神奇。",
	"As you reach the bottom of the long and winding staircase, you emerge into a room filled with rows upon rows of large stone shelves, each containing several hundred books. Magical braisers illuminate this area, but their light strains to reach every nook between the large bookshelves. A swift strig sits reading behind a desk in the center of the room. As you approach he puts down his book and eyes you curiously. \"The Defenders of Alderheart, I presume?\"": "当你到达蜿蜒的长楼梯底部时，你进入一个房间，里面摆满了一排又一排的大石架，每个石架上有几百本书。魔法钎子照亮了这一区域，但它们的光线却难以到达大书架之间的每一个角落。一个敏捷的斯特里格坐在房间中央的书桌后面阅读。当你走近时，他放下手中的书，好奇地看着你。\"阿尔德心的捍卫者，我猜？\"",
	"Odwald will inform the party that he is Mordane Swiftgale, and he's been instructed to help them find whatever they need. While the request came directly from the Dean, Odwald has some trepidation about assisting the party. He fears that if the heroes start poking around, they'll discover the pages he tore from the tomes. If characters notice his nervousness and make a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, have Odwald make an opposed Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. Even if a character succeeds they won't find out anything incriminating, only that Mordane appears apprehensive. If characters report the missing pages to him, Odwald will feign shock and confusion and recommend they notify the Dean as such vandalism is taken very seriously. If a character doesn't believe Odwald, have the character make another Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check opposed by Odwald's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check.": "奥德瓦尔德将告知党派，他是莫丹-斯威夫特盖尔，他被指示帮助他们找到他们需要的东西。虽然这个请求是直接来自院长，但奥德瓦尔德对协助党的工作有些畏惧。他担心如果英雄们开始四处打探，他们会发现他从书本上撕下的那几页。如果人物注意到他的紧张并进行智慧（（%0%））检查，让奥德瓦尔德进行对抗性的魅力（（%1%））检查。即使角色成功了，他们也不会发现任何罪证，只是发现莫丹显得很紧张。如果角色向他报告丢失的书页，奥德瓦尔德会假装震惊和疑惑，并建议他们通知院长，因为这种破坏行为是非常严重的。如果一个角色不相信奥德瓦尔德，让该角色再做一次智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查，由奥德瓦尔德的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查反对。",
	"A success will show the character that Mordane is clearly flustered, but nothing more. Odwald's bluster is in character with Mordane, who was always passionate about the library, and this will help to conceal his true identity.": "一个成功的例子会让人看到莫丹的性格显然是心浮气躁，但仅此而已。奥德瓦尔德的虚张声势符合莫丹的性格，他总是对图书馆充满热情，这将有助于掩盖他的真实身份。",
	"For players who want to use their downtime to research the aspect, they need to decide what types of information to look for. The information the characters will be looking for can broadly fit into four categories: {@b The Scorched Grove}, {@b The Great Calamity}, {@b Elemental Creatures}, and {@b Conjuration Magic}. Each category has an associated amount of time required for research in order to obtain all the information for that category. This time can be lessened by having multiple characters research different areas of the same topic.": "对于想利用停机时间研究方面的玩家来说，他们需要决定寻找哪些类型的信息。角色要寻找的信息大致可以分为四类：（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）和（%3%）。每一类都有一个相关的研究时间，以获得该类的所有信息。通过让多个角色研究同一主题的不同领域，可以减少这一时间。",
	"If the party ends up stuck during research, or are unsure of what to do, you can always have them run into one of the NPCs in this chapter: Professor Birchwalker, Professor Revayne, or even Dean Windsworth. Any of these characters would be able to guide the party in their research and help point them towards the sections they should investigate.": "如果他们在研究过程中被卡住了，或者不确定该怎么做，你可以让他们遇到本章中的一个NPC。伯奇沃克教授、里维恩教授，甚至是温兹沃思院长。这些人物中的任何一个都能指导他们的研究，并帮助他们指出他们应该调查的部分。",
	"Alternatively, if your party finds the research portion boring, you can skip to the incident in {@adventure Shadows Fall|hwcs|4|Shadows Fall} early. This will provide some action and a quick transition from the party's investigation into the strange occurrences happening at the Avium. ": "另外，如果你的队伍觉得研究部分很无聊，你可以提前跳到（%0%）的事件。这将提供一些行动，并从党的调查中快速过渡到在Avium发生的奇怪事件。",
	"While Odwald wants to stop the party's efforts, he knows just how much attention he could draw to himself if he acts out of character. He'll guide them to the first three topics, but anyone looking for help acquiring information on Conjuration Magic will find Mordane busying himself with other tasks, such as cataloging source materials and returning tomes to far-flung wings of the enormous underground library.": "虽然奥德瓦尔德想阻止党的努力，但他知道如果他的行为不符合角色，会引起多少人的注意。他将指导他们学习前三个主题，但任何想要帮助获得关于施法魔法的信息的人都会发现莫丹在忙于其他工作，比如对原始材料进行编目，并将书本送回巨大的地下图书馆的远端。",
	"If what a player wants to research doesn't fit into one of these categories, either base the findings on what's known about the aspect (be careful not to give too much away), or rule that while they located the tome they were looking for, all important information appears to have been on pages that were ripped out. No matter how much time the characters spend on research, the information on torn-out pages can't be found in other books.": "如果玩家想要研究的东西不符合这些类别之一，那么要么根据已知的方面的发现（注意不要泄露太多），要么规定虽然他们找到了要找的巨著，但所有重要的信息似乎都在被撕掉的页面上。无论人物花多少时间进行研究，被撕掉的书页上的信息都无法在其他书中找到。",

The character finds the following passage:": "Grove上现有的大部分文字都涵盖了（%0%）中已经提供的内容。如果有必要，为玩家重申信息，或者直接说没有新的信息。然而，角色在研究这个主题时发现的一本书将包含重要的知识。角色找到了下面这段话。",
	"... from the above evidence, one can conclude that the Scorched Grove displays properties which suggest extreme conjury, perhaps even the calling of a major elemental force.

	"There is very little work of substance on the Great Calamity, as numerous books addressing the subject resort to legend more than truth. Those books which do attempt serious historical study of the event note the relative lack of credible living witnesses. In terms of overall scope, there is a wealth of material written about the Calamity, although the information is unfocused and spread across many books. It could take a character three days of research to get through all there is to read. Quite a few books have had pages torn out and these seem to reference prophecies of some kind, but it's unclear exactly what they pertain to.": "关于大灾难的实质性工作非常少，因为许多涉及这一主题的书籍更多的是诉诸于传说而不是真相。那些试图对该事件进行严肃的历史研究的书籍指出相对缺乏可信的活的证人。就整体范围而言，关于大灾难的材料非常丰富，尽管这些信息没有重点，而且分散在许多书中。一个人可能要花三天的时间来研究，才能读完所有的内容。有不少书被撕掉了几页，这些书似乎提到了某种预言，但不清楚它们到底与什么有关。",
	"The following passage was found:": "发现了以下段落。",
	"... regardless of the origin of the Calamity, whether or not the rumors of an elder elemental being hold any truth to them, a magical event of incredible significance is almost certain to have taken place.

	"A fairly straightforward avenue of research, the library holds a wealth of tomes on elemental creatures. However, elementals of the size seen in the Grove comprise a narrow field of study, and a character researching this subject should be able to find everything they need to know in about two days of study. The following information can be found:": "作为一个相当直接的研究途径，图书馆拥有大量关于元素生物的书籍。然而，在丛林中看到的这种规模的元素生物是一个狭窄的研究领域，研究这个主题的人物应该能够在大约两天的研究中找到他们需要知道的一切。可以找到以下信息。",
	"The most important thing they will learn is that elementals of this size are normally elder elementals, incredibly powerful beings that re-shape the lands in which they live through their sheer presence. These beings would require advanced conjuration magics to summon.": "他们将学到的最重要的东西是，这种体型的元素通常是长老级元素，令人难以置信的强大生命，通过他们的存在重新塑造了他们所居住的土地。这些生物需要高级魔法才能召唤出来。",
	"Many elder elementals have the traits of one or two elements working in concert. Stories from across Humblewood tell of a fire and earth elemental who may have been involved in the calamity that birthed the Scorched Grove.": "许多年长的元素体都具有一种或两种元素协同工作的特征。来自整个汉伯伍德的故事讲述了一个火元素和土元素，他们可能参与了孕育焦土林的灾难。",

	"Finally, the party may come across a few burned pages from an old tome. The pages are badly damaged, almost as if they were saved from a fire, and are kept in a small magical field to prevent further disintegration. Their origin is unknown. The following passage can be made out:": "最后，当事人可能会遇到一本旧书的几页烧毁的书页。这些书页损坏严重，几乎就像从火中救出来的一样，并被保存在一个小的魔法场中，以防止进一步瓦解。它们的来源不明。下面这段话是可以看出来的。",

	"Any player that spends the full amount of days researching Elemental Creatures or The Great Calamity, while also looking for information about ashsnakes, will find a few accounts detailing sightings of similar creatures around the time of the Great Calamity. Although the ashsnakes are definitely related to the element of fire, accounts do not provide enough information to tell whether or not the creatures are elementals, and descriptions of them feeding run exactly counter to this notion, as elementals require neither food nor drink to survive.": "任何花足时间研究元素生物或大灾变的玩家，同时也在寻找关于灰蛇的信息，都会发现一些详细描述在大灾变前后看到类似生物的记载。虽然灰蛇肯定与火元素有关，但这些描述并没有提供足够的信息来说明这些生物是否是元素，而且关于它们进食的描述也与这个概念完全相反，因为元素既不需要食物也不需要饮料来生存。",
	"Any player who picked up on the evidence of conjuration magic in the Grove, possibly from their encounter with the {@adventure Cloud of Emberbats|hwcs|3|Cloud of Emberbats}, could have their character investigate this topic. Other research topics could lead characters here as well. This is a broad category, and even when pared down to tomes on elemental summoning, it would take time to sift through. After four days of research, a character will learn the following:": "任何玩家如果在丛林中发现了施展魔法的证据，可能是在与{@adventure Cloud of Emberbats|hwcs|3|Cloud of Emberbats}的遭遇中发现的，可以让他们的角色调查这个主题。其他的研究课题也可以在这里引导角色。这是一个广泛的类别，即使缩小到关于元素召唤的书本，也需要时间来筛选。经过四天的研究，一个角色将学到以下内容。",
	"Anything as big as the aspect would require huge amounts of energy to seal. It would take tremendous effort on the part of a creature, even one as powerful as the aspect of fire, to break free. This likely couldn't have been done without the seal being weakened by some outside force.": "像这个方面这么大的东西，需要大量的能量来封印。一个生物，即使是像火这样强大的生物，也需要付出巨大的努力才能挣脱。如果封印没有被某种外力削弱，这很可能是不可能做到的。",
	"A large conjuration circle would be needed in order to seal away anything as massive as the aspect of fire. The circle may have become obscured over time, but it is impossible for the aspect to have been kept dormant all this time without it.": "要想封住像火这样巨大的东西，就需要一个大的魔法阵。这个圆圈可能随着时间的推移变得模糊不清，但如果没有它，这个方面不可能一直处于休眠状态。",
	"After finding the previous piece of information, further research will lead the party to a cryptic tome: a treatise by a conjurer who attempted to calculate the location of the postulated conjuration circle within the Grove. The conjurer's treatise is based on painstaking research on energy readings, topography, ley lines, and other academic esoterica. However, while the complex formulae of his calculations remain, the pages that actually specify the location have been ripped out (see {@adventure The Old Classroom|hwcs|4|The Old Classroom}).": "在找到之前的信息后，进一步的研究将引导他们找到一本神秘的小册子：一本由一个试图计算丛林中假定的魔法阵位置的魔法师写的论文。这位魔法师的论文是基于对能量读数、地形、雷电线和其他学术性的神秘事物的艰苦研究。然而，虽然他的复杂计算公式还在，但实际指明位置的那几页已经被撕掉了（见（%0%））。",
	"Without the missing page, the conjurer's calculations could be worked through to find the location of the circle, but it would be incredibly challenging, taking at least a full day of research by someone proficient in the {@skill Arcana} skill. At the end of the day, the researcher must make a DC 21 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. On a success, the character calculates the circle's postulated location in the Grove, which is on its eastern edge, at a point between Winnowing Reach and Alderheart. On a failure, the character must repeat the process, requiring another full day of calculations. Other characters can help with this roll, granting advantage to the character rolling for the check, but only if the supporting characters are also proficient in the {@skill Arcana} skill. Professor Birchwalker can also help a character perform the calculations to find the location of the conjuration circle within the Grove.": "如果没有缺失的那一页，魔法师的计算可以通过找到圆圈的位置，但这将是一个难以置信的挑战，至少需要精通（%0%）技能的人研究一整天。在一天结束时，研究者必须进行DC21智力（（%1%））检查。如果成功，该人物就会计算出圆圈在丛林中的假定位置，即在丛林的东边，在Winnowing Reach和Alderheart之间的一个点。如果失败，该角色必须重复这一过程，需要再计算一整天。其他的角色可以帮助这个滚动，给滚动检查的角色带来优势，但前提是支持的角色也精通{@skill Arcana}的技能。Birchwalker教授也可以帮助一个角色进行计算，以找到丛林中魔法阵的位置。",
	"After the party completes five days of research, Odwald will become nervous. He'll try to use a necromantic ritual ripped from one of the tomes he stole in an attempt to scare the party off. He'll wait until the party members are absorbed in their tasks before acting. When no one is watching him, he will use {@spell greater invisibility} to move unseen and unheard between the large stacks, then cast the ritual slowly and quietly. Once Odwald completes the ritual, he'll discard the useless ritual page in a place where the characters can find it, attempting to frame another necromancer on campus. If characters search the area where the shadows appeared, they will find the page. A DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check will reveal the dark runes scratched upon the parchment to be associated with particularly foul necromancy. All the magic in the runes has been spent.": "在队伍完成了五天的研究后，奥德瓦尔德会变得紧张。他将尝试使用从他偷来的一本书籍中撕下的亡灵仪式，试图把党员们吓跑。他会等到党员们都沉浸在自己的任务中时再行动。当没有人注意到他时，他会使用（%0%）在大堆书之间隐蔽地移动，然后缓慢而安静地施展仪式。一旦奥德瓦尔德完成了仪式，他就会把无用的仪式页丢弃在一个人物可以找到的地方，试图在校园里陷害另一个死灵法师。如果人物搜索阴影出现的地方，他们会发现这页纸。通过DC16智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查，会发现划在羊皮纸上的黑暗符文与特别肮脏的死灵法术有关。符文中所有的魔力都已耗尽。",
	"Odwald's ritual curses the characters, causing their {@creature shadow} to detach and become an undead creature in the character's likeness. The shadows each attack the character to which they are closest, and if in an area of dim light they will use their bonus action to hide immediately before making their attack. Party members in the main areas of the library will be in conditions of bright light, while those between the shelves will be in areas of dim light. If anyone calls for help, Odwald, still disguised as Mordane, will hear it but ignore their pleas.": "奥德瓦尔德的仪式诅咒了这些角色，使他们的（%0%）脱离并成为与该角色相似的不死生物。阴影会攻击与它们最接近的角色，如果在光线昏暗的区域，它们会在进行攻击前立即使用它们的额外行动来隐藏。在图书馆主要区域的党员将处于亮光条件下，而在书架之间的党员将处于暗光区域。如果有人呼救，仍然伪装成Mordane的Odwald会听到，但不会理会他们的请求。",
	"Once the shadows are defeated, Odwald will arrive and make excuses for his absence at the onset of battle. He'll tell a story about having to return some terribly fragile evocation scrolls to a far-away section of the library. If any characters doubt this story, have them make opposed Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) checks against Odwald's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. Odwald makes this check with advantage. He knows this library like the back of his talon and can easily lead the characters to the exact section where he placed the tomes earlier to set up this alibi.": "一旦影子被打败，奥德瓦尔德就会来到这里，为他在战斗开始时的缺席找借口。他将讲述一个故事，说他必须把一些非常脆弱的唤醒卷轴送回图书馆的一个遥远的区域。如果有任何角色怀疑这个故事，让他们对Odwald的魅力({@skill Insight})进行相反的智慧检查。奥德瓦尔德做这个检查有优势。他对这个图书馆了如指掌，可以很容易地把人物引到他之前放置书本的地方，以建立这个不在场证明。",
	"If a party member succeeds, let it be known Mordane is hiding something, but don't reveal exactly what. A good thing to note is that a party member's success should put him on a list of potential suspects for the strange occurrences on campus, not force the final encounter early. If pressured, Odwald would likely keep up his ruse, and even call security on the party if they try a heavy-handed tactic like resorting to intimidation.": "如果一个党员成功了，让大家知道莫丹在隐藏什么，但不要透露具体内容。需要注意的是，党员的成功应该把他列入校园里发生的奇怪事件的潜在嫌疑人名单，而不是强迫提前进行最后的交锋。如果施加压力，奥德瓦尔德很可能会继续他的诡计，如果党员尝试采用恐吓这样的强硬手段，甚至会呼叫保安。",
	"Regardless of the conversation, Odwald will ask if the party requires aid, and if any have been injured he will use his faculty amulet to contact Avium security and medics. The party members will be escorted to the infirmary, where healers will tend to their wounds and examine them with divination magic. The healers will ask any characters who've taken Strength damage to finish a short rest in the infirmary, to make sure the curse of undeath is fully purged. Characters should return to normal after completing a short or long rest.": "无论谈话内容如何，奥德瓦尔德都会询问党员是否需要援助，如果有人受伤，他将使用他的教员护身符联系阿维姆的保安和医务人员。党员们将被护送到医务室，那里的医护人员会照顾他们的伤口，并用占卜魔法检查他们。医护人员会要求任何受到强度伤害的角色在医务室完成短暂的休息，以确保不死的诅咒被完全清除。角色在完成短期或长期休息后应恢复正常。",
	"This isn't recommended, but should the decision be made to force the final encounter early—if the party isn't the type for mysteries—this section will detail how they can proceed from this point.

	"The Dean will elaborate if the characters have questions. He's received odd reports from across campus, and believes them to be the result of some as yet undiscovered magical defense built into the Avium being accidentally triggered. He has a few leads that might help the party find out what's happening. Normally, the Dean would trust such investigations to the Perch Guard, but he has so little to go on at this point that he'd rather not involve them if it turns out to be something minor. If the party mentions anything suspicious on the part of the faculty, the Dean will insist they gather sufficient proof first. He trusts his staff and will need hard evidence before he can even consider the possibility of one of them being to blame. The Dean outlines three leads for the party to follow-up on:": "如果人物有问题，院长会详细说明。他收到了来自整个校园的奇怪报告，并认为这些报告是一些尚未被发现的内置在Avium中的魔法防御被意外地触发的结果。他有一些线索，可能会帮助当事人找出发生了什么。通常情况下，院长会把这种调查托付给栖息地卫队，但他目前没有什么线索，如果事实证明是小事的话，他宁愿不把他们牵扯进来。如果当事人提到教员方面有什么可疑之处，院长会坚持让他们先收集足够的证据。他信任他的教职员工，在考虑他们中的某个人应受责备的可能性之前，他需要确凿的证据。院长概述了三条线索，供当事人跟进。",
	"A poor student, {@creature Figory Figgins|Humblewood}, is a skittish jerbeen who recently applied for sick leave. He filed reports about experiencing something unusual and frightening on campus. Most people think he's exaggerating to gain a medical exemption from classes, but the Dean believes something scared Figory. In truth, Figory was attacked by the {@creature cobblefright|Humblewood}, and was afflicted when it drained some of his vitality. The party will find Figory in the first year dormitories in the central building, near the ground floor (see {@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|hwcs|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}).": "一个穷学生，{@creature Figory Figgins|Humblewood}，是一个胆小的小丑，最近申请了病假。他提交报告说在校园里经历了一些不寻常的、令人恐惧的事情。大多数人认为他是在夸大其词，以获得免于上课的医疗许可，但院长认为有什么东西吓到了费戈里。事实上，费戈里受到了{@creature cobblefright|Humblewood}的攻击，当它耗尽他的一些生命力时，他受到了折磨。当事人会在中央大楼的一年级宿舍里找到费戈里，就在一楼附近（见（%2%））。",
	"{@creature Corvax Revayne|Humblewood}, a dusk corvum divination instructor, has made cryptic predictions, regarding a bad event that's either going to, or already has happened on the campus. He's a brilliant scholar, but also a bit of an oddball. It would be of great help if the party could check in and see what exactly the old corvum has predicted. It might be related to the events on campus. He has an office in the central building, but he can be found in the divination lab in one of the outer spires (see {@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|hwcs|4|A Disturbed Diviner}).": "{@creature Corvax Revayne|Humblewood}，一个黄昏的科沃姆占卜讲师，已经做出了神秘的预测，关于校园里即将或已经发生的坏事。他是一个杰出的学者，但也是一个有点古怪的人。如果党能检查一下，看看老科沃姆到底预言了什么，这将是很大的帮助。它可能与校园里的事件有关。他在中央大楼里有一间办公室，但在其中一个外塔楼的占卜实验室里也能找到他（见{@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|hwcs|4|A Disturbed Diviner}）。",
	"A studious sera luma named {@creature Jell Platena|Humblewood} has lodged a complaint about the servitor skeletons on campus acting oddly. It's minor, but it might be worth looking into. Jell doesn't know this, but what she saw was the direct result of Odwald controlling the servitor skeletons to help in his research. She can be found in one of the libraries in the inner spires (see {@adventure The Apprehensive Apprentice|hwcs|4|The Apprehensive Apprentice).": "一个名叫{@creature Jell Platena|Humblewood}的勤奋的塞拉-卢马提出了一个投诉，说校园里的仆人骷髅行为怪异。这是个小问题，但可能值得研究一下。杰尔不知道，但她所看到的是奥德瓦尔德控制仆人骷髅帮助他研究的直接结果。她可以在内部尖塔的一个图书馆里找到（见{@adventure The Apprehensive Apprentice|hwcs|4|The Apprehensive Apprentice）。",

	"The door to the dormitory room opens only a crack, and through it you can see a small eye looking at you nervously. A timid voice squeaks, \"Who are you? What do you want?\"": "寝室的门只开了一条缝，透过门缝你可以看到一只小眼睛紧张地看着你。一个胆小的声音吱吱喳喳地说：\"你是谁？你想要什么？\"",
	"If the party explains they're here to question Figory, he'll shut the door and ask them to leave. The party can convince him to let them in with a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check or a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check. They can also try a more subtle route, such as claiming they were sent to check up on his health. Figory, really does feel burdened with his secret, but he isn't convinced people will believe him.": "如果当事人解释说他们是来询问费戈里的，他就会把门关上并要求他们离开。当事人可以用DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查或DC12魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）检查来说服他让他们进来。他们也可以尝试更微妙的方法，比如说声称他们是被派来检查他的健康状况的。菲戈里，真的觉得自己的秘密有负担，但他不相信人们会相信他。",
	"Figory looks pale and weak. His face is drained of color and his eyes are heavy, as though he hasn't slept. If the party persuaded their way in or otherwise entered in a non-threatening way, Figory will open up and tell them his story. If they intimidated or otherwise bullied their way in, they'll have to succeed on another {@skill Intimidation} skill check (at the same DC) to get him to speak. On a failure, he won't talk, and if the party continues to push he'll ask them to leave immediately, warning the group that he will call for campus security if they don't. If the party can get him to speak, this is the story Figory tells:": "菲戈里看起来很苍白，很虚弱。他的脸被抽干了颜色，他的眼睛很沉重，好像没有睡觉。如果当事人以说服的方式进入，或者以非威胁的方式进入，费戈里就会敞开心扉，告诉他们他的故事。如果他们恐吓或以其他方式欺负他们，他们将不得不在另一个{@skill Intimidation}技能检查中取得成功（在相同的DC下）来让他说话。如果失败，他就不会说话，如果当事人继续逼迫，他会要求他们立即离开，并警告他们，如果他们不离开，他就会叫来校园保安。如果当事人能让他说话，这就是费戈里讲的故事。",
	"\"It was a cold night. It was raining. I—I could hear scratching, like something scraping at the wall outside my window. When I looked out, I saw it. This huge monster was c-c-climbing with its c-claws... It saw me too. It had four eyes. Four big red eyes. It opened its mouth and... I think I passed out.

You probably think I'm crazy... don't you?\"": "\"那是一个寒冷的夜晚。当时下着雨。我......我听到挠痒痒的声音，好像有什么东西在我窗外的墙上刮来刮去。当我向外看时，我看到了它。这个巨大的怪物正用它的爪子在爬......。它也看到了我。它有四只眼睛。四只红色的大眼睛。它张开嘴，然后... 我想我昏过去了。当我醒来的时候，我感觉很不舒服，它--它就这样消失了。你可能认为我疯了......对吗？\"",
	"If the party asks around to see if other students heard or saw anything, there will be no corroboration. It was raining heavily, and even Figory will admit to only being able to hear the creature faintly through the downpour. If anyone in the party casts {@spell detect magic} on Figory they will find that he has a faint aura of necromancy about him, as though he was recently affected by necromantic magic.": "如果当事人四处打听，看看其他学生是否听到或看到了什么，就不会有任何证实。当时正下着大雨，即使是费戈里也承认只能在大雨中隐约听到那怪物的声音。如果队伍中有人对菲戈里施展（%0%），他们会发现他身上有一种微弱的亡灵之气，就好像他最近受到了亡灵魔法的影响。",
	"Figory isn't interested in getting too involved in the investigation. He explains that he has to focus on his health in order to be ready for the next semester, but it would be a great comfort to know the party has caught the creature he saw before it can hurt someone. He will provide them with any information he can before they leave.": "费戈里没有兴趣过多地参与调查。他解释说，他必须专注于自己的健康，以便为下个学期做好准备，但如果知道党在他看到的生物伤害别人之前就已经抓住了它，那将是一个很大的安慰。在他们离开之前，他将向他们提供任何他能提供的信息。",
	"If the party examines the outside of the trunk where Figory saw the creature, a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check will be enough to uncover marks on the trunk's surface, as well as a few pieces of bone peeking out of the soft earth.": "如果一行人在菲戈里看到怪物的地方检查树干的外面，通过DC15智力（（%0%））检查就可以发现树干表面的痕迹，以及从软土里探出的几块骨头。",
	"The marks on the trunk are faded and subtler than one would expect from Figory's story. These are leftover from the transmutation magic Odwald used to cover up the damage done by his escaped cobblefright creation. Any wizard specializing in transmutation can instantly identify magical tampering on the trunk upon examination. Such a character would also be able to tell that whoever covered up these markings wasn't a specialist transmuter: there are differences in the way the magic was used here, and a true master of this magical school could have blended these markings seamlessly. The same information could be discerned by any other character with a DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.": "树干上的痕迹已经褪色，比人们从费戈里的故事中所期望的还要细微。这些是奥德瓦尔德用来掩盖他逃跑的鹅卵石恐惧症造物所造成的伤害的转化魔法所留下的。任何专门研究转化术的巫师在检查时都能立即识别树干上的魔法篡改。这样的人物也能看出，掩盖这些标记的人并不是专业的转化师：这里的魔法使用方式有差异，这个魔法流派的真正大师可以将这些标记融合得天衣无缝。同样的信息可以由任何其他角色通过DC16智力（（%0%））检查辨别出来。",
	"The bone fragments on the ground can be identified as birdfolk bones with a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check, but the pieces are too small to make out anything else. The bones feel strange to anyone holding them, somehow imparting a sense of unease. Casting {@spell detect magic} on the bones will reveal them to have a strong aura of necromancy.": "通过DC15智慧（（%0%））或智慧（（%1%））检查，地上的骨头碎片可以被识别为鸟人的骨头，但碎片太小，无法辨认其他东西。拿着这些骨头的人感觉很奇怪，莫名其妙地产生了一种不安的感觉。对骨头施展{@spell detect magic}，会发现它们有强烈的死灵之气。",
	"Professor Revayne is in his classroom, at a table specially prepared for divination. He is performing some kind of ritual with a set of small animal bones when the party enters. The interruption causes him to lose focus and curse at the party, until he realizes they are the Defenders of Alderheart. Then, he is eager for their aid in convincing the Dean to mount an investigation regarding the strange omens he keeps reading in relation to the College. Instead of explaining further, Professor Revayne will demonstrate by performing the {@spell augury} ritual now.": "里维恩教授在他的教室里，在一张专门为占卜准备的桌子旁。他正在用一组小动物的骨头进行某种仪式，这时一行人进来了。这一打扰使他失去了注意力，并对这一行人破口大骂，直到他意识到他们是阿尔德心的捍卫者。然后，他急于让他们协助说服院长就他一直读到的与学院有关的奇怪预兆展开调查。Revayne教授没有进一步解释，而是通过现在进行的{@spell augury}仪式进行示范。",
	"As he casts the magic, and throws a set of small animal bones inside a prepared ritual circle, they begin to glow. A soft voice speaks, revealing a cryptic clue:": "当他施展魔法，并将一组小动物的骨头扔进准备好的仪式圈内时，它们开始发光。一个柔和的声音在说话，揭示了一条隐秘的线索。",

The professor is unsure what to make of it, but he thinks the first line might hint that the threat comes from someone people trust on campus: a student, or perhaps even a faculty member.": "这就是过去几周里，仪式每天所揭示的内容。教授不确定该如何理解，但他认为第一句话可能暗示威胁来自校园里人们信任的人：一个学生，甚至可能是一个教员。",
	"If showed the bones from {@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|hwcs|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}, Professor Revayne will cast {@spell detect magic} on them, and report the necromantic aura. This is outside of his area of expertise, but he'll postulate they might be from one of the servitor skeletons that perform menial tasks throughout the school. If the party tells the professor about the creature Figory described, he'll be unnerved and caution them to proceed carefully. Necromancy is only taught in theory at the Avium, and the servitor skeletons are all former faculty members or alumni who willingly donated their remains to the College after a natural death. If anyone were to have created something else, it would surely be cause for alarm. Either way, if Professor Revayne found or heard that the bones appear to have an aura of necromancy about them, he'll direct the party to {@creature Glinda Nightseed|Humblewood}, a professor of theoretic necromancy (see {@adventure The Necromancer|hwcs|4|The Necromancer}).": "如果展示的是来自{@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|hwcs|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}的骨头，里维恩教授会对它们施以{@spell detect magic}的魔法，并报告死灵之气。这不属于他的专业领域，但他会推测这些骨头可能来自于在学校里从事琐碎工作的某个仆人骷髅。如果当事人告诉教授菲戈里描述的生物，他会感到不安，并告诫他们要小心行事。亡灵术在阿维姆只是理论上的教学，而仆人骷髅都是前教员或校友，他们在自然死亡后自愿将遗体捐给学院。如果有人创造了别的东西，肯定会引起恐慌。无论如何，如果里维恩教授发现或听说这些骨头似乎有一种死灵的气息，他会引导当事人去找{@creature Glinda Nightseed|Humblewood}，一位理论死灵的教授（见{@adventure The Necromancer|hwcs|4|The Necromancer}）。",
	"It might take the party a bit of time to locate Jell. She's a serious student, and is often on the go from one place to the next for classes, extra credit activities, and her own personal studies. If the party asks around campus, during the day they should be able to find which library she's currently in with a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Investigation}) check. They can also ask the Dean for her dorm room location, where they'll be able to track her down at night, but she might not be in much of a mood to talk at that point.": "党员们可能需要花点时间来找到杰尔。她是个严肃的学生，经常为了上课、课外活动和她自己的个人研究而从一个地方跑到另一个地方。如果当事人在校园里问一问，白天他们应该可以通过DC13魅力({@skill Investigation})检查找到她目前在哪个图书馆。他们也可以向院长询问她的寝室位置，在那里他们可以在晚上找到她，但她可能在那个时候没有什么心情说话。",

If anyone were to know what was happening with the skeletons, it would be Professor Nightseed.": "杰尔当天向行政部门提交了一份通知，但在她没有听到任何回音后，她认为这是他们所为。她猜测这可能是一次有计划的演习或维护。她无法提供比这更多的信息，但她可以把当事人指向格琳达-诺斯德教授，他教的是理论性死灵法术的高级课程（见（%0%））。如果有人知道这些骷髅是怎么回事，那一定是Nightseed教授。",
	"If the party suspects that the individual they believe to be Mordane Swiftgale is behind the strange happenings, they may begin to investigate him.

	"Professor Nightseed seems nice enough, if a little strange, and she is a skilled necromancer. But the Professor is hiding a secret that makes her seem very suspicious, especially around the subject of the campus' servitor skeletons. She has been using these legal reanimations to practice new ways of imbuing simple undead creatures with greater faculties, on par with the living. This is gray-area work, definitely bending some of the strictures against necromancy at the Avium, if not breaking the rules outright, and it could cost the professor her job.": "Nightseed教授看起来很好，如果有点奇怪的话，她是一个熟练的死灵法师。但教授隐藏着一个秘密，使她看起来非常可疑，特别是围绕着校园的仆人骷髅的话题。她一直在利用这些合法的复活术来练习新的方法，为简单的不死生物赋予更多的能力，与活人一样。这是一项灰色地带的工作，即使没有直接违反规则，也绝对是对阿维姆大学反对死灵法术的一些规定的曲解，而且这可能会使教授失去工作。",

This is a museum, and behind glass panels the party can see fossils, as well as magical recreations of extinct plants. The west and east wing both contain fossils and skeletons of animals from different points in the natural history of Humblewood. The sound of chanting carries over from the east wing. When the party enters the east wing read the following:": "任何人都可以通过DC12智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查来发现这些树并不是自然生长在一起的。有些甚至可能是被魔法改变的。中央建筑没有门，只有一个宽大的拱门，通向圆顶结构的内部。这是一个博物馆，在玻璃板后面，人们可以看到化石，以及灭绝植物的神奇再现。西翼和东翼都有化石和动物骨骼，它们来自汉伯伍德自然史上的不同时期。诵经的声音从东翼传来。队伍进入东翼后，请阅读以下内容。",

Suddenly, two elk skeletons flash with crackling, dark energy, and burst from their glass confines. They circle your party.": "你看到一个影子在远处移动，并听到光滑的石板上传来尖锐的脚步声。突然，两具麋鹿骨架闪烁着噼里啪啦的黑暗能量，从它们的玻璃罩里冲了出来。它们围绕着你们一行人。",
	"Use the stat block for a {@creature minotaur skeleton} to determine the fighting capabilities of the elk skeletons. Replace the minotaur's greataxe attack with a hoof attack that deals the same amount of bludgeoning damage.

	"At the start of the elk encounter, the party catches a glimpse of someone fleeing. The retreating figure is an undisguised Odwald, who needed to be nearby to reanimate the skeletons. Odwald's robes are enough to conceal his features, but any character within 5 feet of him will be able to tell he is a corvum. If anyone follows the sound of his footsteps, they will end up outside where they witness a dark hooded figure leap from the terrarium's edge, feathered arms outstretched. Within a round, Odwald will use a scroll of {@spell fly} he has prepared to hide in the darkness within the rotating spires of the College. From there he can use {@spell greater invisibility} to guarantee his escape. If forced to defend himself, Odwald will fight, looking to end things quickly while making his escape. While not intent on killing anyone, Odwald isn't opposed to seriously injuring his opponents. All the better if it slows down their investigation.": "在遇到麋鹿的一开始，队伍就瞥见有人在逃窜。逃跑的人是一个未加掩饰的奥德瓦尔德，他需要在附近让骷髅复活。奥德瓦尔德的长袍足以掩盖他的特征，但在他5英尺范围内的任何人物都能看出他是个科沃姆。如果有人顺着他的脚步声走，他们就会到外面去，在那里他们会看到一个黑暗的蒙面人物从水族馆的边缘跃出，伸出羽毛状的手臂。在一个回合内，奥德瓦尔德将使用他准备的{@spell fly}的卷轴，躲在学院旋转的尖顶内的黑暗中。在那里，他可以使用{@spell greater invisibility}来保证他的逃跑。如果被迫自卫，奥德瓦尔德会战斗，希望在逃跑的同时迅速结束事情。虽然不打算杀死任何人，但奥德瓦尔德并不反对严重伤害他的对手。如果能延缓他们的调查，那就更好了。",
	"After combat, characters will be able to search the Forest Terrarium for clues. Any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check will discover a scroll which was accidentally dropped by Odwald in his retreat. This heavy vellum scroll bears necromantic symbols. It is also clearly marked as material belonging in the lower library. A character can attempt a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to decipher the spell, but a Wizard of the Necromancy Arcane Tradition rolls with advantage. On a success, the character will deduce that these sigils form a spell designed to control large numbers of simple undead, such as the Avium's servitor skeletons. Characters who fail this check can take this scroll to Professor Nightseed (if she hasn't been arrested) or to the Dean, either of whom will be able to decipher it and tell the party that this is scroll forbidden to leave the library. Furthermore, it looks to have been altered by a highly skilled mage to enhance its effectiveness.": "战斗结束后，角色们将能够在森林植物园中寻找线索。任何角色如果在DC16智力（（%0%））检查中成功，就会发现奥德瓦尔德在撤退时不小心掉落的一个卷轴。这张厚重的牛皮纸卷轴上有亡灵的符号。它也被清楚地标记为属于下层图书馆的材料。一个角色可以尝试用DC18智力({@skill Arcana})检查来破译这个咒语，但是死灵法术传统的巫师在翻滚时有优势。如果成功，该角色将推断出这些符号构成了一个旨在控制大量简单亡灵的咒语，例如阿维姆的仆从骷髅。没有通过这个检查的角色可以把这个卷轴拿给Nightseed教授（如果她还没有被逮捕的话）或者院长，他们都可以破译它并告诉当事人这是禁止离开图书馆的卷轴。此外，它看起来被一个高超的法师修改过，以增强其效力。",

	"If the party needs more help, have Dean Windsworth call them up to discuss their progress.

This requires a group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check against DC 14. Reduce the DC to 10 if Glinda was apprehended, as Odwald will be less careful with a scapegoat behind bars. Either way, if the party fails this check, Odwald will notice their efforts and not use the secret entrance.": "{@b {@i If the party spends a full day stealthily staking out Mordane Swiftgale,}}他们可能会抓到他在一些架子后面溜走，这可能会把他们带到有暗门的墙上。这需要集体进行灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）的检查，对抗DC14。如果格林达被逮捕了，则将DC降低到10，因为奥德瓦尔德在有替罪羊的情况下会更谨慎。无论怎样，如果队伍没有通过这个检查，奥德瓦尔德会注意到他们的努力而不使用这个秘密入口。",
	"{@b {@i If the party spends a day in the lower library,}} they will notice some of the servitor skeletons abruptly stop their programmed tasks. Should the characters follow the skeletons closely, the skeletons will lead them to a wall that appears to be a dead end, but which actually hides a secret door.": "{@b {@i If the party spends a day in the lower library,}}他们会注意到一些仆人骷髅突然停止了它们的程序化任务。如果人物紧跟这些骷髅，这些骷髅会把他们带到一堵看似死胡同的墙上，但实际上却隐藏着一扇秘密的门。",
	"{@b {@i If the party researches the documents on the Avium's construction,}} after a day of research, the party will find an old scroll with lower library blueprints that show plans for lower level classrooms and laboratories.

	"Regardless of how they are led to the wall in the lower library, investigating it with a successful DC 15 {@skill Investigation} check will reveal a hidden door. The door opens when pushed inward, causing a stone slab to recede into a groove, revealing a secret path.

A lever on the opposite side of the door can be used to open it again. Once the party makes it through the door, read:": "无论他们是如何被引向下层图书馆的墙壁的，用成功的DC15{@skill Investigation}检查来调查它，会发现一个隐藏的门。这扇门向内推就会打开，使一块石板退到一个凹槽里，露出一条秘密通道。某种隐藏的机制在五秒过后重置了门，但在门关闭之前有足够的时间让大家通过。在门的对面有一个杠杆可以用来再次打开它。一旦队伍通过了这扇门，请阅读。",

A simple wooden door lies to the left.": "这间小石室有发霉和陈旧的气味。书架排列在墙上，尽管它们主要是空的，靠右墙有一张桌子。房间中间摆放着一把带垫子的椅子。大部分家具都是旧的，除了那把椅子，它似乎是新增加的。左边是一扇简单的木门。",
	"When the characters enter the study, they will notice that it's clean, and appears to have seen recent use. The wooden door to the left of the entrance opens into a closet, which contains the real librarian, Mordane Swiftgale. Mordane is standing upright, though his eyes are closed as if he is sleeping, and he's surrounded by a field of swirling gray energy, which has a jelly-like viscosity when touched. He does not appear to be breathing. If Mordane is checked for a pulse, a character will find that he is alive, but his pulse is beating at an incredibly slow rate. It is obvious he's being kept alive and imprisoned by this magic, but a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check is required for a character to figure out that necromancy is involved, and that it's holding Mordane in a state of suspended animation. This effect can be dispelled, and counts as a 4th level spell for the purposes of determining the DC of {@spell dispel magic}.": "当人物进入书房时，他们会注意到书房很干净，而且似乎是最近才使用过的。入口左侧的木门通向一个壁橱，里面是真正的图书管理员莫丹-斯威夫特盖尔。莫丹直挺挺地站着，虽然他的眼睛闭着，好像在睡觉，他的周围是一片旋转的灰色能量场，触摸时有一种果冻般的粘性。他似乎没有呼吸。如果检查莫丹的脉搏，角色会发现他还活着，但他的脉搏跳动速度慢得惊人。很明显，他被这个魔法保持着生命并被囚禁着，但是需要通过DC18智力（（%0%））检查，角色才能发现死灵法术的参与，以及它使莫丹处于悬浮状态。这个效果可以被驱散，并且在确定DC{@spell dispel magic}的时候算作是一个四级法术。",
	"A crystal pendant hangs from a hook on the inside of the closet door. The pendant looks familiar, and any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence check, or who has the Sharp Mind trait, will recognize it as the one worn by the birdfolk they know as Mordane. Analyzing the pendant reveals it to possess both moderate transmutation and illusion auras. Anyone who puts on the pendant assumes the appearance of Mordane Swiftgale, and an examination of the character in this form will reveal no magical aura of any kind until the pendant is removed.": "壁橱门内侧的钩子上挂着一个水晶吊坠。这个吊坠看起来很眼熟，任何成功通过DC14智力检查的角色，或者拥有敏锐思维特质的角色，都会认出它是他们所知道的鸟人莫丹所佩戴的。通过分析吊坠，可以发现它同时拥有适度的转化和幻觉光环。任何戴上吊坠的人都会变成莫丹-斯威夫特盖尔的样子，而在这种形态下对人物的检查会发现没有任何形式的魔法光环，直到吊坠被移除。",

The aspect is immortal, and the only sure way to defeat it for good is to drain its vital energies through necromancy. To Odwald, stopping the aspect is worth any risk. He is condescending to the party at every opportunity. He is arrogant, and doesn't think the Defenders of Alderheart could possibly understand what he sees as necessary steps to stop the aspect. He is also deeply afraid for the future of the Wood, and doesn't believe the party can be trusted to defeat the aspect on their own.": "如果有机会，奥德瓦尔德会解释他的计划，详细说明他从已故的鸟人身上创造出了cobblefright，并讲述了他是如何窃取他所需要的信息来阻止这个方面。这方面是不朽的，唯一能永远打败它的方法是通过死灵法术耗尽它的重要能量。对奥德瓦尔德来说，阻止这个方面是值得冒任何风险的。他一有机会就会对党的人说三道四。他很傲慢，不认为奥尔德之心的捍卫者们能够理解他所认为的阻止这个方面的必要步骤。他还对森林的未来深感恐惧，并且不相信党能靠自己的力量打败这个方面。",

	"If the party attacks Odwald, or fails to reason with him, he will order the cobblefright to hold them off while he flees.

Other party members may suffer the same fate for failing to report such a dangerous tome and return it to those trained in its proper care. At the Dean's behest, any banned characters may be granted restricted, temporary access to the Avium.

During this time the party is free to avail themselves of the potions lab or the spell libraries on campus (see {@adventure Exploring the Avium|hwcs|4|Exploring the Avium}). Since the party can teleport back to the Avium (unless they've been banned for life), use this time to deal with character hooks or plotlines.

He'll inform the players that Odwald is a member of the illustrious and noble Ebonhart family from Alderheart. He was an adventurer in his past, as well as an alumnus of the Avium. The Dean appears saddened that such a prestigious scholar turned to the dark arts. According to Odwald's notes, he blamed himself for the awakening of the aspect, but the details of how Odwald might have been involved are unclear. Among them, however, are scrawlings of a prophecy predicting that a member of the Ebonhart family would be the one to finally heal the Wood from the effects of the Great Calamity.": "{@b {@i If Odwald was slain,}}院长会发现一些关于Odwald的背景的有趣信息。他会告诉玩家，Odwald是来自Alderheart的杰出而高贵的Ebonhart家族的成员。他过去是一名冒险家，同时也是阿维姆的校友。院长对这样一位有名望的学者转而从事黑暗艺术显得很难过。根据奥德瓦尔德的笔记，他把这一方面的觉醒归咎于自己，但奥德瓦尔德可能参与的细节并不清楚。然而，在这些笔记中，有一个预言的涂鸦，预言埃邦哈特家族的一个成员将是最终从大灾难的影响中治愈森林的人。",
	"In his research, Odwald also found writings about a mystical artifact called {@i the Borealus}, which was hidden sometime after the Great Calamity. He discovered records of its creation, penned by the wizard who crafted, stored it in the Avium's lower library. Using these valuable notes, Odwald theorized a ritual that might utilize this artifact's power to seal the aspect of fire. He had abandoned the ritual in favor of the cobblefright, because he couldn't ascertain whether or not the records of the artifact were genuine. However, scribbles in the margins of his notebook hint that he was considering contacting someone he knew from his adventuring days to help him divine its location.": "在他的研究中，奥德瓦尔德还发现了关于一个叫做（%0%）的神秘神器的著作，这个神器在大灾变后的某个时候被隐藏起来。他发现了它的创造记录，是由制作它的巫师写的，存放在Avium的下层图书馆。利用这些有价值的笔记，奥德瓦尔德理论了一个仪式，可能会利用这个神器的力量来封印火的方面。他放弃了这个仪式，而选择了鹅卵石恐惧症，因为他无法确定这件神器的记录是否真实。然而，他的笔记本空白处的涂鸦暗示他正在考虑与他在冒险时代认识的人联系，以帮助他推测其位置。",
	"At this point, {@i the Borealus} may be the best lead the party has for a way to defeat the aspect. The Dean will ask them to travel to Alderheart and speak with the companion mentioned in Odwald's notes, a hedge witch named {@creature Susan of the Swamp|Humblewood} (if Susan is dead, see the {@adventure Should the Worst Have Happened|hwcs|5|Friendship with Riffin}). While they do this, the Dean will look over the formulae Odwald used, to see if he might be able to perform this ritual. However, the ritual clearly won't work without the power of {@i the Borealus} (skip to {@adventure Susan the Seer|hwcs|5|Susan the Seer}).": "在这一点上，{@i the Borealus}可能是党派拥有的击败方面的最佳线索。院长会要求他们前往Alderheart，与Odwald笔记中提到的同伴交谈，一个名叫（%%1%）的树篱女巫（如果Susan已经死了，请看（%%2%））。在他们这样做的时候，院长会看一下奥德瓦尔德使用的公式，看看他是否有可能完成这个仪式。然而，如果没有{@i the Borealus}的力量，这个仪式显然不会成功（跳到{@adventure Susan the Seer|hwcs|5|Susan the Seer}）。",
	"If the players wish to inform {@creature Riffin, the Ash-Knight|Humblewood} of Odwald's demise, have them run into him in Alderheart. He is once again at the Wooden Flagon, retracing his steps in the hopes of meeting Odwald along the way. Riffin will be saddened to hear about the loss of his friend, but he will remain confident that even if Odwald seemed bad, he had a good heart. Riffin will offer to help the party in any way he can, something which may become necessary in {@adventure Facing the Aspect|hwcs|5|Facing the Aspect}.": "如果玩家想告知{@creature Riffin, the Ash-Knight|Humblewood}奥德瓦尔德的死讯，让他们在奥德心遇到他。他再次来到木制酒壶，重走他的路，希望能在路上遇到奥德瓦尔德。听到失去朋友的消息，Riffin会很难过，但他仍然相信，即使Odwald看起来很坏，他也有一颗善良的心。Riffin会主动提出以任何方式帮助党，这在{@adventure Facing the Aspect|hwcs|5|Facing the Aspect}中可能成为必要的事情。",
	"If Odwald was apprehended, the party will receive a summons from the Dean to convene in his office. When the party arrives Odwald will be there, waiting beside Dean Windsworth. Odwald has some kind of silver bangles affixed to his wrists, which the Dean explains are necessary to prevent Odwald from using magic.": "如果奥德瓦尔德被抓获，当事人将收到院长的传票，到他的办公室开会。当一行人到达时，Odwald会在那里，在Windsworth院长身边等待。Odwald的手腕上贴着某种银手镯，院长解释说这是防止Odwald使用魔法的必要手段。",
	"The old corvum wishes to pursue a lead that could reveal the location of a magical artifact called {@i the Borealus}, a weapon that may seal away the aspect's energies and return it to a dormant state beneath the Grove. It was a coincidence that Odwald stumbled upon historical accounts of this artifact, and while he isn't convinced it exists or whether the ritual he's created will work, it's the only thing he can think of that might stop the aspect from continually being reborn.": "老科沃姆希望追寻一条线索，这条线索可以揭示一件名为{@i the Borealus}的魔法神器的位置，这件武器可能会封住方面的能量，让它回到丛林下的休眠状态。奥德瓦尔德偶然发现了关于这件神器的历史记载，虽然他不相信它的存在，也不相信他所创造的仪式是否会奏效，但这是他能想到的唯一可能阻止方面不断重生的东西。",
	"The Council has granted Odwald permission to join the party in order to follow up on this lead. He is to stay within sight of the party at all times, until the aspect of fire has been dealt with. Afterwards, Odwald must be brought to Alderheart for trial and sentencing. Characters may have reservations about teaming up with Odwald, but there's no other choice. The Dean is clearly suspicious of Odwald, but the necromancer's research has granted him a situational awareness that the Dean would need time to grasp. Furthermore, Odwald's past experience as an adventurer means he knows his way around the Wood. If Odwald attempts to flee, the party is to apprehend him at once and deliver him to Alderheart.": "委员会已经允许奥德瓦尔德加入队伍，以跟进这一线索。他要一直呆在队伍的视线范围内，直到火的方面被处理好。之后，Odwald必须被带到Alderheart进行审判和判决。角色们可能对与Odwald合作有所保留，但没有其他选择。院长显然对Odwald心存疑虑，但死灵法师的研究使他获得了院长需要时间才能掌握的局势意识。此外，奥德瓦尔德过去作为冒险家的经验意味着他知道自己在森林里的路。如果奥德瓦尔德试图逃跑，队伍要立即逮捕他并把他交给奥德心。",
	"If the party apprehends Odwald, once given leave to assist the party, Odwald will help them willingly. Time has made him reflect on his actions, and he feels great shame.

Particularly, the divination professor, {@creature Corvax Revayne|Humblewood}, may be able to locate Odwald. The party can meet with Professor Revayne in his office, where he has already made the necessary preparations.": "院长已经向他最博学的教授们通报了党的情况，许多人都表示愿意提供任何可能的帮助。特别是占卜学教授，{@creature Corvax Revayne|Humblewood}，也许能找到奥德瓦尔德。当事人可以在雷维恩教授的办公室与他见面，他已经在那里做了必要的准备工作。",
	"Inside this small office, the furniture has been pushed aside to make space for an intricate chalk circle drawn with several flourishes on the flat stone floor. Professor Revayne, still sketching symbols around the circle's edge, is startled by your approach and immediately stands to address you. \"Be careful! This circle must reflect the many threads of fate in order to show what is possible. Erase any of them and we risk inaccuracy!\" He then motions for you to move to the edges of the room.": "在这间小办公室里，家具被推到一边，腾出空间在平坦的石板地上用粉笔画了一个复杂的圈。Revayne教授仍在圆圈边缘勾画符号，他被你的接近吓了一跳，立即站起来对你说话。\"要小心！\"。这个圆圈必须反映命运的许多线索，以显示可能的情况。抹掉其中任何一个，我们就有可能不准确！\" 然后他示意你移到房间的边缘。",
	"Once he finishes a few strokes, or fills in any lines a hapless character may have stepped on, grumbling as he does so, he will lightly hop into the center of the circle. He asks that someone pass him his tools: a crystal on a string, a bowl of water, and a bag of sand, all of which are easily accessible on the nearby table. Professor Revayne carefully places the bowl of water in the center of the circle, and requests silence while he works. He will suspend the crystal over the bowl and begin to incant his spell.": "一旦他完成了几笔，或者填上了一个无能的角色可能踩到的任何线条，一边抱怨，他就会轻巧地跳到圈子的中心。他要求有人把他的工具递给他：一串水晶、一碗水和一袋沙子，所有这些都在附近的桌子上很容易拿到。里维恩教授小心翼翼地将水碗放在圆圈中心，并要求在工作时保持安静。他将把水晶悬挂在碗上，开始念咒语。",
	"The air in the room crackles with arcane energy as the pendulum swings back and forth over the bowl of water, which reflects the crystal above like a mirror. The corvum's eyes glow white as he casts a small pinch of sand into the water. It ripples, and images begin to form on its surface. As the pendulum is pulled strongly southeast by an invisible force, you can see tree-farms, wagons filled with goods, and corrals of giant insects. With a gentle \"swoosh\" the circle of chalk lifts from the ground and disappears into vapour, returning both the bowl of water and the professor to normal.": "当钟摆在水碗上来回摆动时，房间里的空气发出奥术能量的噼啪声，水碗像镜子一样反射出上面的水晶。当科沃姆把一小撮沙子投进水里时，他的眼睛发出了白色的光芒。它泛起涟漪，图像开始在其表面形成。当钟摆被一种无形的力量强力拉向东南时，你可以看到树木农场、装满货物的马车和巨大昆虫的畜栏。随着轻轻的 \"咻 \"的一声，粉笔圈从地上升起，消失在蒸汽中，水碗和教授都恢复了正常。",
	"Professor Revayne will inform the party that Odwald is in Brackenmill. This place appears to have personal significance to Odwald, though the professor can't guess what it might be. However, the professor is certain the necromancer's form will be veiled in concealing magic. Professor Revayne will also impart that someone else in Brackenmill is looking for Odwald. There was a winged shield in his vision: the one who bears this shield is the key to finding Odwald.": "Revayne教授会告诉大家，Odwald在Brackenmill。这个地方似乎对奥德瓦尔德有个人意义，尽管教授无法猜测它可能是什么。然而，教授确信死灵法师的形态将被隐藏的魔法所掩盖。Revayne教授还将传授，在Brackenmill还有人在寻找Odwald。在他的视野中，有一个带翅膀的盾牌：持有这个盾牌的人是找到奥德瓦尔德的关键。",
	"He will also remind the party that the augury he performed in {@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|hwcs|4|A Disturbed Diviner} (\"the master weal, the monster woe\") might mean Odwald is a potential ally. He'll caution them against making any rash moves against Odwald, as his vision gave him the impression the necromancer might yet have a part to play in the fate of the Wood.": "他还会提醒大家，他在{@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|hwcs|4|A Disturbed Diviner}进行的预言（\"主人的利益，怪物的祸害\"）可能意味着奥德瓦尔德是一个潜在的盟友。他将提醒他们不要对奥德瓦尔德采取任何轻率的行动，因为他的幻象给他的印象是，这个死灵法师可能还能在森林的命运中扮演一个角色。",
	"The professor will also provide the party with a {@item gem of seeing}. This variant of the item grants only the effects of {@spell see invisibility} rather than {@sense truesight}, and it does not regain charges at dawn. Once all its charges have been expended it will become a normal, non-magical gem. Professor Revayne will point out that this item could come in handy if the necromancer attempts to use {@spell invisibility} to escape (as he may have done in their first encounter).": "教授也会为当事人提供一个（%0%）。这个物品的变体只赋予{@spell see invisibility}而不是{@sense truesight}的效果，而且它在黎明时分不会重新获得能量。一旦它的所有电荷耗尽，它将成为一个普通的、非魔法的宝石。里维恩教授会指出，如果死灵法师试图使用{@spell invisibility}来逃跑（就像他在他们第一次相遇时可能做的那样），这个物品就会派上用场。",
	"Armed with new knowledge, players can prepare to set out from the Avium, though it will take about three days on the road to reach Brackenmill. Have this trip be uneventful in order to keep up the game's pace, but hint at the growing power of the aspect by mentioning that the air is much warmer and drier than it was when the party began their journey. The forest also appears quieter than usual as they travel. These are dire times indeed.": "掌握了新的知识，玩家可以准备从阿维姆出发，虽然在路上要花三天左右的时间才能到达布拉肯米尔。为了保持游戏的节奏，让这次旅行变得平淡无奇，但要提到空气比他们开始旅行时要温暖和干燥得多，从而暗示这方面的力量在不断增长。在他们旅行的过程中，森林也比平时显得更加安静。这的确是个可怕的时代。",
	"Since his escape from the Avium, Odwald has reached Brackenmill, where he now weighs his options. His research has been set back to zero, he has none of his materials or laboratory equipment, and while he harbors some idea of how to stop the aspect he isn't certain the artifact even exists, let alone if its powers are truly as strong as he's read. After having had time to reflect, he is painfully aware of the danger he posed to the innocent people at the College. He has also spotted his old friend Riffin in Brackenmill, and a part of him desperately seeks to confess his misdeeds to the strig knight. However, Odwald lacks courage and will simply be trying to lay low. When the Defenders of Alderheart arrive, he is contemplating his next steps.": "自从他从Avium逃脱后，Odwald已经到达Brackenmill，他现在在那里衡量他的选择。他的研究已经归零，他的材料和实验室设备都没有了，虽然他对如何阻止这个方面有一些想法，但他并不确定这个神器是否存在，更不用说它的力量是否真的像他所看到的那样强大。在有时间反思之后，他痛苦地意识到他对学院里无辜的人所造成的危险。他还在布拉克米尔发现了他的老朋友瑞芬，他的一部分人急切地想向这位坚强的骑士坦白自己的过失。然而，奥德瓦尔德缺乏勇气，只想低调行事。当阿尔德心的卫士们到达时，他正在考虑他的下一步行动。",
	"Odwald is using {@spell disguise self} to pose as a traveling huden gallus monk, staying at the Sunny Silkworm Inn. He must limit his interactions with others due to the nature of the spell, but the form he has chosen roughly matches his own size, so the spell is difficult to uncover at a glance. Any player that specifically examines Odwald can make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to see if something is amiss; for example, if a part of his vestments passes through a table as he moves by. Any physical interaction with Odwald would be enough to detect his illusion, so he'll do his best to deny the party that opportunity by keeping his distance. Odwald endeavours to stay in his rented lodgings for as long as he can, only making appearances in the inn's common room or around town in short intervals, since he must hide and re-cast his spell each hour to maintain its effect. Any player able to scan Odwald with {@spell detect magic} will instantly know he is under the effect of an illusion spell.": "奥德瓦尔德正在使用{@spell disguise self}冒充旅行中的胡登加勒斯僧侣，住在阳光蚕食旅馆。由于法术的性质，他必须限制与他人的交往，但他所选择的形式与他自己的体型基本吻合，所以这个法术很难被一眼看穿。任何专门检查奥德瓦尔德的玩家都可以进行DC15智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，看看是否有什么不妥；例如，如果他走过时，他的法衣的一部分穿过了桌子。与Odwald的任何身体互动都足以发现他的幻觉，所以他将尽力通过保持距离来拒绝对方的机会。奥德瓦尔德努力在他租来的房子里呆得越久越好，只在旅馆的公共休息室或镇上短时出现，因为他必须每小时隐藏并重新施展他的法术以维持效果。任何能够用{@spell detect magic}扫描奥德瓦尔德的玩家都会立即知道他受到了幻觉法术的影响。",
	"If he ever feels as though he has been discovered, Odwald will attempt to flee into the forest.": "如果他觉得自己被发现了，奥德瓦尔德会试图逃进森林。",
	"When the party reaches Brackenmill, they'll find themselves looking up at a series of lush tree canopies. These will be immediately recognizable as perch-farms; the boughs are filled with familiar herbs, fruiting vines, and are tended by several farmers. Corrals on the ground house different varieties of giant insects, including giant silkworms, munching on greenery.": "当队伍到达布拉克米尔（Brackenmill）时，他们会发现自己正仰望着一系列茂盛的树冠。这些树冠可以立即辨认出是栖息地农场；树桠上长满了熟悉的草药、果实累累的藤蔓，并由几个农民打理。地面上的畜栏饲养着不同品种的巨型昆虫，包括巨型蚕，它们在啃食绿色植物。",
	"Brackenmill is a lively hub for folks of all kinds, and upon seeing travelers, folks will smile and greet them politely, welcoming them to their perch. Steps shaped into the tall trees allow players to climb up to a series of bridges made of wood and rope, and platforms that serve to connect the trees together.": "布雷肯米尔是各种人群的热闹中心，看到旅行者后，人们会微笑着礼貌地问候他们，欢迎他们来到自己的栖息地。塑造在高大树木上的台阶让玩家可以爬上一系列由木头和绳子组成的桥梁，以及将树木连接在一起的平台。",
	"The locals here are a hearty folk, and while busy, they exude a kind of rustic hospitality that is honest and charming. If any characters ask about life in Brackenmill of late, locals will tell them that things have been busy. This season, people have had to work even harder than usual to produce enough crops to aid those displaced by the fires. Moreover, it has been so dry that crops require more care to keep them green and healthy. Some of the Tenders have helped by nourishing the plants with their magic, but such services are in short supply. It's been a hard year, and everyone is overworked.": "这里的当地人是一个丰饶的民族，虽然忙碌，但他们散发着一种质朴的好客，诚实而迷人。如果有任何人物问起布雷肯米尔最近的生活，当地人会告诉他们，事情很忙。这个季节，人们不得不比平时更努力地工作，以生产足够的农作物来援助那些因火灾而流离失所的人。此外，天气非常干燥，作物需要更多的照顾，以保持它们的绿色和健康。一些投标人通过用他们的魔法滋养植物来提供帮助，但这种服务是供不应求的。这是艰难的一年，每个人都工作过度。",

Many travelers frequent it, and some even pay to keep rooms in permanent reserve.": "{@b {@i If the characters ask around for clues about any strange travelers entering town,}}当地人不会有什么帮助。毕竟每天都有人来来往往，在依靠布拉克米尔的树木农场的各个栖息地之间运输货物和材料。民众会把玩家引向当地的旅馆--\"阳光蚕\"，它位于镇中心附近。许多旅行者经常光顾它，有些人甚至花钱把房间长期保留下来。",
	"The Sunny Silkworm is a large inn and tavern housed in an expansive, circular wooden building in the center of Brackenmill's sprawl. The building rests on a disk-shaped wooden platform seated within the gnarled branches of a great tree that has been shaped around it. Different bridges connect with the wooden platform to allow travel from all around Brackenmill. The place looks cozy and inviting, and players who approach will notice a wooden sign above the door with a smiling silkworm munching on a leaf. Pleasant-smelling smoke wafts from the large chimneys that emerge from its quaint thatched roof. The inn is usually bustling, and today is no exception. When the party enters the building, read:": "阳光之蚕是一家大型客栈和酒馆，位于布拉肯米尔的中心地带，是一座宽阔的圆形木制建筑。这座建筑坐落在一个圆盘状的木质平台上，坐落在一棵大树的虬枝上，这棵大树被塑造成它的周围。不同的桥梁与木质平台相连，允许从布拉克米尔的各个地方出行。这个地方看起来舒适而诱人，走近的玩家会注意到门上的木牌，上面有一只微笑的蚕在啃叶子。从古朴的茅草屋顶上冒出的大烟囱里飘出了令人愉悦的烟雾。这家旅馆通常很热闹，今天也不例外。当一行人进入建筑时，请读。",
	"The common room of this inn and tavern teems with activity. Many birdfolk and humblefolk of all descriptions are engaged in talk, drink, and games.

The character talking with Riffin can make a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince him to take the course of action they suggest, but the difficulty check of the skill should be modified based on the approach party members take while talking with Riffin. For example, if they appeal to his sense of honor and duty to the Wood, the check should be easier. Some players may decide to have Riffin and Odwald meet to talk things over, which could also be successful. Characters who try to convince Riffin can make any number of arguments:": "一旦Riffin在接待访客，Odwald会鼓励党员去说服弦乐骑士坚持下去，帮助他们的党。与瑞芬交谈的角色可以进行魅力（（%0%））检查，以说服他采取他们建议的行动方案，但该技能的检查难度应根据党员在与瑞芬交谈时采取的方法来修改。例如，如果他们呼吁他对森林的荣誉感和责任感，那么检查应该更容易。有些玩家可能会决定让Riffin和Odwald见面谈一谈，这也可能会成功。试图说服Riffin的角色可以提出任何数量的论据。",

	"Riffin will accompany the party back to the Avium, but he won't have much to say along the way—he's more of a doer than a thinker. Despite recent events, should it be required, he'll act as a character witness for Odwald. Riffin will never totally forgive the old corvum, but he can attest to his brilliance and reliability from their years of adventuring together. Riffin is willing to journey with the party to Alderheart. He'll choose to bunk separately at the Wooden Flagon, the inn and tavern in the trunk district. If the players wish, Riffin can accompany them on the rest of their journey. If he joins the party, he will be treated as another character for the purposes of dividing up XP.": "瑞芬将陪同党员回到阿维姆，但他一路上不会有太多话说，他更像是一个行动者而不是一个思考者。尽管最近发生了一些事情，但如果需要的话，他将为奥德瓦尔德充当角色证人。瑞芬永远不会完全原谅这个老科沃姆，但他可以从他们多年的共同冒险中证明他的聪明才智和可靠性。瑞芬愿意和队伍一起前往阿尔德心。他将选择在树干区的旅馆和酒馆Wooden Flagon单独打地铺。如果玩家愿意，Riffin可以陪他们走完剩下的旅程。如果他加入队伍，在划分XP时，他将被视为另一个角色。",

	"At this point the party will be led to Alderheart either by the living Odwald, or by information Dean Windsworth gleaned from the deceased corvum's notes. There, Odwald's old friend and former adventuring companion, Susan of the Swamp, can be found. Susan's eclectic scholarship has led to her possessing some esoteric knowledge. This, coupled with her unique divination abilities, means she is the party's best hope of finding {@i the Borealus}.": "这时，党员们会被活着的奥德瓦尔德或迪恩-温兹沃斯从已故的科沃姆的笔记中收集到的信息引向奥德心。在那里，可以找到奥德瓦尔德的老朋友和以前的冒险伙伴，沼泽地的苏珊。苏珊不拘一格的学术研究使她掌握了一些深奥的知识。这一点，加上她独特的占卜能力，意味着她是这支队伍找到（%0%）的最大希望。",

Havel will support Tevor, and say he believes this agrees with references to an ancient chamber in the Scorched Grove. The text appeared in the historical records around the same time as the stories of {@i the Borealus} being sealed away.

He will say, tearfully, that he recalled a story Tevor once told him, and he just needed to look up references in the ancient records to be sure.

	"In stark contrast to their last trip through the Scorched Grove, the party will find the ashen plain to be eerily silent and devoid of life, even the strange variety that usually finds purchase here.

Read the following if the party is carrying the sprig of skyleaf with them:": "经过几个小时在丛林中的旅行，一行人应该会到达青蛙形状的岩石，但他们需要弄清楚如何找到地牢的入口。没有合适的钥匙，地牢的入口就不会出现。如果一行人带着天叶的树枝，请阅读以下内容。",
	"As soon as you and your companions arrive at the frog-shaped rock formation, the ground begins to quake. Five pedestals emerge from the ashes, one at each cardinal point around a flat disk that rises in their center. The fifth stands in the middle of the disk. One of the four outer pedestals is broken.": "当你和你的同伴到达青蛙形状的岩层时，地面开始震颤。五个基座从灰烬中出现，每一个基座都围绕着一个平坦的圆盘，圆盘在其中心升起。第五个站在圆盘的中间。四个外部基座中的一个被打破了。",
	"The pedestals rise from the earth, to a height of four feet. The ones to the west, east, and south have distinctive carvings and motifs, along with a domed receptacle on their top which opens like a mouth. The receptacles are large enough to fit the sprig of skyleaf. The fourth pedestal to the north is broken in half and exhibits obvious wear, as though it had been smashed long ago. The pedestal in the center of the disk has no domed receptacle or motif carved, only an inscribed Druidic rhyme. Druidic is a language known only by druids, but any character using the {@spell comprehend languages} spell or a similar effect will be able to read this:": "基座从地上升起，高达四英尺。西边、东边和南边的基座有独特的雕刻和图案，上面还有一个圆顶的容器，像嘴巴一样打开。容器很大，足以装下一枝天草。北面的第四个基座断成了两半，有明显的磨损，好像很久以前就被砸过。圆盘中央的基座没有雕刻圆顶的容器或图案，只刻有德鲁伊的韵文。德鲁伊语是一种只有德鲁伊才知道的语言，但任何使用{@spell comprehend languages}法术或类似效果的人物都能读懂这个。",

	"to the cleanser of forests, the sapling's life-giver.": "献给森林的净化者，小树苗的生命赐予者。",
	"The motifs carved into the three intact pedestals represent elemental forces of nature. The one to the west has motifs of waves and rain clouds, the one to the east has gusting winds and blowing leaves, and the one to the south has flames and smoke plumes. Upon closer examination, the broken pedestal has worn geometric motifs, depicting fallen trees on fractured ground, most likely representing earth. At least one party member must stand in the middle of these pedestals when placing the skyleaf sprig into a receptacle. Whether or not the party chooses the correct answer, nothing will happen if no one is standing in the center of the \"compass\" when placing the sprig inside a receptacle.": "在三个完整的基座上雕刻的图案代表了自然界的元素力量。西边的一个有波浪和雨云的图案，东边的一个有阵风和吹叶，南边的一个有火焰和烟羽。仔细观察，破损的基座上有磨损的几何图案，描绘的是断裂地面上的倒下的树木，很可能代表着大地。在将天叶树枝放入容器时，至少有一名党员必须站在这些基座的中间位置。无论当事人是否选择了正确的答案，如果在将树枝放入容器时没有人站在 \"罗盘 \"的中心，就不会发生任何事情。",
	"The correct answer is to set the sprig in the receptacle of the pedestal with the flame motifs. This will cause the sprig to ignite with magical flames and the pedestals to recede, revealing the door to the dungeon.": "正确的答案是把小树枝放在有火焰图案的基座的容器里。这将导致小树枝被魔法火焰点燃，基座退去，露出通往地牢的大门。",
	"The ashen field shifts again as the pillars recede beneath it. Then, with a lurch, a small hill rises from the ashes. A square section on the front of this hill falls away, revealing an open door. Ancient stone steps descend into darkness.": "随着柱子在下面退去，灰烬的领域又发生了变化。然后，随着一阵晃动，一座小山从灰烬中升起。这座小山前面的一个方形部分掉了下来，露出了一扇敞开的门。古老的石阶下到黑暗中。",

The water within the pool is very deep, and moves as if possessed by a will of its own. Characters inside of the pool can feel a strong force attempting to pull them down into the cold depths and hold them there.": "{@b {@i If the sprig is placed in the receptacle of the pedestal with the water motif,}}在罗盘中心的党员会陷入一个陷阱，因为柱子之间的圆盘会瞬间变成一个直径15英尺的冷水池。池子里的水很深，移动起来就像被自己的意志所控制。池子里的人物可以感觉到一股强大的力量，试图把他们拉到冰冷的深处，并把他们留在那里。",

	"Any player can use their action to attempt the {@skill Athletics} check again on their turn. A character that has been pulled under can succeed on this check to reach the surface, allowing them to gasp for air. A character that is not currently being held under the water can attempt the {@skill Athletics} check again on their turn to pull themselves free of the pool, though doing so is sufficiently taxing, and a character who successfully escapes the trap can do nothing else this turn.": "任何玩家都可以在他们的回合中使用他们的行动再次尝试（%0%）检查。被拉入水底的角色可以通过这个检定成功到达水面，让他们能够喘息。目前没有被压在水底的角色可以在他们的回合中再次尝试{@skill Athletics}检定，将自己从水池中拉出来，尽管这样做是足够费力的，而且成功逃脱陷阱的角色在这个回合中不能做其他事情。",

A character who has been pulled under the water is out of reach to a character outside of the pool, but characters in the pool who have not been can assist those who have been pulled under. Players may think of clever strategies to help their friends out, like throwing ropes and the like, but the water is dark in addition to being bitterly cold, and any character that was pulled under makes Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks with disadvantage.": "池外的任何角色都可以进行DC15力量（（%0%））的检查来解救池内的人。被拉到水底的角色对池外的角色来说是遥不可及的，但池中未被拉到的角色可以帮助被拉到水底的人。玩家可能会想出一些巧妙的策略来帮助他们的朋友，比如扔绳子之类的，但是水里除了严寒之外还是黑暗的，任何被拉下水的角色都要进行智慧({@skill Perception})检查，并处于不利地位。",

	"Players may think of clever strategies to help their friends out. Using a staff or a 10-foot pole a character can attempt to free a trapped ally without the risk of being sucked in themselves.

Any thrown ropes or projectiles will simply be blown aside by the force of the sphere's winds.": "玩家可以想出巧妙的策略来帮助他们的朋友脱困。使用法杖或10英尺长的柱子，一个角色可以尝试解救被困的盟友，而不会有自己被吸进去的危险。使用像{@spell thunderwave}这样的法术将盟友炸开的效果也会奏效。任何抛出的绳索或投射物都会被球体的风力吹到一边。",

	"You see a chamber that appears to have been shaped out of black, volcanic rock. There is a wooden disk in the center of this chamber that has a series of druidic runes carved into its surface. In one quadrant of the disk these runes glow dimly with red light. Four alcoves surround this central room, equidistant from each other. In three of them, large statues of eagles, made from the same volcanic rock, rest upon intricately shaped branches of small, petrified trees.

Each statue comes alight as the rock from which it is composed turns to barely-cooled magma. The 3 statues are Medium creatures that use the stat block for {@creature gargoyle|mm|gargoyles}, with the following changes:": "这个房间有60英尺宽，每个凹室有10英尺宽。房间中央的木质圆盘对火灾的伤害是免疫的，雕像所在的石化树也是如此。当整个队伍进入房间时，一块石板将圆形入口封住，将队伍困在里面。每座雕像都被点燃，因为它所组成的岩石变成了几乎没有冷却的岩浆。这3座雕像是中型生物，使用状态块为（%0%），有以下变化。",

	"When an eagle statue is defeated it transforms into red flames, which are drawn toward the druidic runes on the wooden disk in the room's center. This will cause a section of the central platform's runes to glow red. Once the statues have been defeated, all of the runes will be lit, and the platform can be used to travel between this room and the dungeon's lower level. Stepping onto the activated platform, a character will learn that the code words \"ascend\" and \"descend\" can be spoken anywhere in this dungeon to cause this platform to magically float down to the lower levels, or rise back up to this chamber.": "当老鹰雕像被打败时，它会变成红色的火焰，被吸引到房间中央的木盘上的德鲁伊符文。这将导致中央平台上的一部分符文发出红色的光芒。一旦这些雕像被打败，所有的符文都会被点亮，这个平台可以用来在这个房间和地牢的下层之间旅行。踏上被激活的平台，角色将了解到，在这个地牢的任何地方说出 \"上升 \"和 \"下降 \"的暗语，就可以使这个平台神奇地漂浮到下层，或者上升到这个房间。",

	"This large subterranean cavern is lit by the glow of magma, which flows below an island of rock. A long bridge connects the island to a bank on the other side, where a passageway continues through the cavern wall. It is sweltering in here.": "这个大型地下洞穴被岩浆的光芒照亮，岩浆在一个岩石岛的下面流动。一座长桥将该岛与另一侧的岸边连接起来，那里有一条通道继续穿过洞壁。这里面很闷热。",
	"The island is a mere 30 feet wide, and the ceilings are 60 feet high. The magma lies 60 feet below the island of rock, and any character that gets too near the edges of the island will feel its full heat. The heat isn't enough to cause damage, but any creature that falls into the magma will almost certainly die, if they're not immune to fire damage, taking 33 ({@dice 6d10}) points of fire damage each time they enter magma for the first time on a turn, or end their turn there. Fortunately, under normal circumstances there are no dangers within this place that would cause a character to fall into the magma. Add such hazards if desired, but consider the risks carefully.": "该岛仅有30英尺宽，天花板有60英尺高。岩浆位于岩石岛下方60英尺处，任何角色如果太靠近岛的边缘，就会感受到它的全部热量。热量并不足以造成伤害，但任何掉入岩浆的生物几乎肯定会死，如果他们不对火系伤害免疫的话，每次在一个回合中第一次进入岩浆，或在那里结束回合，都会受到33（（%0%））点火系伤害。幸运的是，在正常情况下，这个地方没有任何危险会导致角色掉进岩浆里。如果需要的话，可以增加这种危险，但要仔细考虑风险。",
	"The bridge over the magma is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. It appears to have small gaps at 5-foot intervals. Any player who steps onto the bridge's surface will trigger the bridge's main trap, which will cause a 20-foot-high jet of flame to erupt from the nearest gap. This jet remains for a few seconds, receding for a moment before flaring up again.": "横跨岩浆的桥梁有10英尺宽，20英尺长。它似乎每隔5英尺就有一个小缝隙。任何踏上桥面的玩家都会触发桥上的主要陷阱，这将导致一道20英尺高的火焰喷射从最近的缝隙中喷出。这股火焰会持续几秒钟，在再次喷发前会消退片刻。",
	"The party can tell that these flame jets aren't made of magma, but that they are still dangerous. Any character who passes through one will need to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to avoid taking damage. Failure on this check means the character must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or take 10 ({@dice 3d6}) points of fire damage from the flames on a failure, or half as much on a success. Whether or not they succeed on this save, the characters will arrive on the other side of the jet, which will trigger the next flame jet.": "当事人可以看出这些火焰喷射器并不是由岩浆制成的，但它们仍然很危险。任何通过这些火焰喷射器的人都需要通过DC 16的灵巧({@skill Acrobatics})检查来避免受到伤害。如果检查失败，则意味着该角色必须进行DC 17的灵巧救赎，否则失败时将受到10({@dice 3d6})点的火焰伤害，成功时将受到一半的伤害。无论他们是否成功挽救，角色都会到达喷射器的另一侧，这将触发下一次火焰喷射。",
	"Characters who hesitate once they begin crossing will find their energy sapped, as they are caught between the hot jets. It is impossible for a character to run across the bridge avoiding these jets, unless they succeed on the listed {@skill Acrobatics} check for every jet they cross.": "一旦开始过桥，那些犹豫不决的角色会发现他们的能量被耗尽，因为他们被夹在热喷气之间。角色不可能避开这些喷气机跑过桥，除非他们在每一个喷气机上都能成功地进行列举（%0%）检查。",

	"Players with resistance to fire may be able to make it across even if they cannot succeed on their checks, especially if they have the ability to heal themselves.": "对火有抵抗力的玩家即使不能成功检查，也可能成功穿越，特别是如果他们有自我治疗的能力。",
	"Players can attempt to block the jets of flame, though the jets erupt with enough force to blast through wooden barriers. If a metal object (like a shield) is held in place to allow passage across a jet, it will be rendered red hot, causing 9 ({@dice 2d8}) points of fire damage to anyone holding or stepping onto the object.": "玩家可以尝试阻挡火焰喷射，尽管喷射的力量足以炸开木质屏障。如果一个金属物体（如盾牌）被固定住以允许通过喷射，它将被烧成红色，对持有或踏上该物体的人造成9({@dice 2d8})点火焰伤害。",
	"The {@spell Tenser's floating disk} spell will completely block the flame jets, and its magic will shield anyone on top of the disk from the heat of the jets, allowing for easy passage.": "{@spell Tenser's floating disk}的法术将完全阻挡火焰喷射，它的魔力将为盘子上面的人屏蔽喷射的热量，让人轻松通过。",
	"Use the above rules to decide whether any of the more unique solutions players could conceive of will work.": "使用上述规则来决定玩家可以设想的任何更独特的解决方案是否可行。",
	"On the bank at the other side of the bridge is a lever disguised as a rock formation. Any character with a passive perception of 17 or higher, or who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, will be able to notice the lever. When pulled, the lever causes the flame jets to cease, and the magma in the chamber to cool almost instantly into solid rock. The tunnel into the rock wall ahead is the only way forward.": "在桥的另一边的岸边，有一个伪装成岩石构造的杠杆。任何被动感知力达到17或更高的角色，或者成功通过DC17智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查的角色，都能注意到这个杠杆。当拉动这个杠杆时，火焰喷射就会停止，室内的岩浆几乎瞬间冷却成固体岩石。进入前面的岩壁的隧道是唯一的出路。",
	"The passageway from the magma chamber continues for another 400 feet, curving downwards until it leads into a strange space.": "从岩浆室出来的通道又继续走了400英尺，向下弯曲，直到进入一个奇怪的空间。",
	"The tunnel transitions into a room that has been magically shaped from the earth beneath the Grove. The floor is made of black cobblestones, shaped from a layer of volcanic rock. Breaking through the stones is a line of three great trees. Each tree appears black and charred, with leaves of flame and bark that glows like embers. The tree in the middle is the largest, and its roots tangle outward in a great mass.": "隧道过渡到一个房间，这个房间是由格罗夫下面的土地神奇地塑造出来的。地板是由黑色鹅卵石构成的，由一层火山岩塑造而成。突破石头的是一排三棵大树。每棵树都呈现出黑色和烧焦的状态，叶子是火焰，树皮则像余烬一样发光。中间的树是最大的，它的根部向外纠结成一个巨大的团体。",
	"The room is 90 feet long and 60 feet wide. The largest tree is {@creature Oakheart|Humblewood}. Once enough of the party has made it within 80 feet of the trees, Oakheart will reveal himself, shuddering as if waking from a deep slumber. His body shifts into a more humanoid form. Oakheart speaks slowly in Birdfolk, or in Druidic if one of the party members is a druid, with a voice that sounds like a cross between creaking wood and a blasting forge.": "这个房间有90英尺长，60英尺宽。最大的树是（%0%）。一旦有足够多的人走到离树80英尺的范围内，Oakheart就会显露出来，他颤抖着，仿佛从沉睡中醒来。他的身体会转变为更像人的形态。橡树心会用鸟语缓慢地说话，如果队伍中有人是德鲁伊，则用德鲁伊语说话，其声音听起来就像吱吱作响的木头和爆炸的锻刀之间的交叉。",
	"Suddenly, the great tree at the back of the room quivers, and its bark shifts to reveal eyes and a mouth. Its long branches twist into hands and its roots become large feet. \"Hrrmmmmmm... so... I am to receive... guests? How long has it been?\" the creature creaks. \"You do not look... like Tenders... a test is in order then...\"": "突然，房间后面的大树颤抖起来，它的树皮摇身一变，露出了眼睛和嘴巴。它的长枝扭曲成手，它的根部变成了大脚。\"嗯嗯嗯......所以...... 我是来接待......客人的？有多长时间了？\"这个生物吱吱作响。\"你们看起来......不像是投标人......那么，测试是有必要的......\"",
	"Oakheart will then fight the party to test whether or not they possess the skill needed to safely control {@i the Borealus}. If the above dialog was interrupted by a player launching an attack at any point, do not treat Oakheart as being surprised and simply roll initiative as normal. Oakheart is sworn to guard {@i the Borealus} from thieves, and if attacked while speaking he'll scold the players on his turn, saying:": "然后，Oakheart会与该方战斗，以测试他们是否拥有安全控制所需的技能（%0%）。如果上面的对话在任何时候被玩家发动的攻击打断，不要把Oakheart当成是被惊吓到了，只需像正常一样滚动主动权。橡树心发誓要守护{@i the Borealus}的盗贼，如果在说话时被攻击，他会在轮到他的时候责骂玩家，说。",

	"Oakheart will begin by animating the other two charred trees in the room. They have stats identical to Oakheart, but otherwise follow the rules for animated trees in the {@creature treant} stat block.": "橡树心将开始为房间里的另外两棵烧焦的树做动画。它们的状态与Oakheart相同，但在其他方面遵循{@creature treant}状态块中关于动画树的规则。",
	"Oakheart will not die once he reaches 0 hit points, but he will cease his assault and return the trees he animated to their posts. He is a guardian, but unless the party shows or has shown signs of ill intent throughout the dungeon, he will sense that they are not thieves and try not to kill them. He simply wishes to test whether or not they are strong enough to control the terrible power of {@i the Borealus}.": "橡树之心一旦达到0命中率就不会死，但他会停止攻击，并将他施展魔法的树木归位。他是个守护者，但除非队伍在整个地牢中表现出或已经表现出不怀好意的迹象，否则他会感觉到他们不是盗贼，并尽量不杀他们。他只是想测试一下他们是否有足够的力量来控制（%0%）的可怕力量。",
	"If the party does poorly in this fight, Oakheart may cease his assault and dismiss his animated trees, sitting down to parley. He'll ask why they have risked their lives to obtain {@i the Borealus}. If Oakheart is satisfied with the answer (attempting to save the Wood from burning is an acceptable explanation), he will give them the staff.": "如果队伍在这场战斗中表现不佳，Oakheart可能会停止攻击并解散他的动画树，坐下来进行谈判。他会问他们为什么冒着生命危险来获得（%0%）。如果Oakheart对他们的回答感到满意（试图拯救森林不被烧毁是一个可以接受的解释），他将把法杖交给他们。",
	"Whether defeated in battle or convinced to give the players {@i the Borealus}, Oakheart will inform the party that he has safe-guarded the artifact with his own life force, and for its power to become unsealed his life must end. There's no way around this. If characters sympathize, he will thank them for their concerns, and offer a warm smile before delivering the parting statement:": "无论是在战斗中被击败还是被说服给玩家（%0%），Oakheart都会告诉玩家他已经用自己的生命力保护了这个神器，为了让它的力量被解封，他的生命必须结束。这是没办法的事。如果角色们表示同情，他将感谢他们的关心，并在发表离别声明前提供一个温暖的微笑。",
	"\"I have lived for a very... very... very long time. I go... with the blessing of the Nightfather... that I may pass onto you... this burden.\" Oakheart then reaches into a hollow in his trunk, and pulls out a luminous crystal staff. \"Plant this one in flames... such is its power... otherwise... the Wood may freeze...\"": "\"我已经活了非常... 非常... 非常长的时间。我走了......带着夜之父的祝福......我可以把这个负担传给你。\" 然后，Oakheart把手伸进他树干上的一个空洞里，拿出一根发光的水晶杖。\"把这个放在火焰中......这是它的力量......否则......木头可能会被冻结......\"",
	"As Oakheart speaks the light from his bark dims, and his flame-leaves fade, leaving behind a large blackened tree amidst the chamber.": "当Oakheart说话时，他的树皮发出的光变暗了，他的火焰叶子也褪去了，只留下一棵发黑的大树在室内。",

	"Upon returning to Alderheart, give the party a chance to have a long rest and recover from any exhaustion they may have suffered traveling through the Grove. After resting, they will find Dean Windsworth waiting for them in the common room of the inn in which they are staying. He has been called on by the Council to advise the Defenders of Alderheart during these perilous times. The Dean will be stupefied by the existence of {@i the Borealus}, and overjoyed that the party has obtained it. This means there is a chance to stop the aspect and save the Wood.": "回到阿尔德心后，给一行人一个机会，让他们长时间休息，恢复在丛林中旅行时可能遭受的疲惫。休息过后，他们会发现温兹沃斯院长在他们所住的旅店的公共房间里等着他们。他被理事会召见，在这危险的时刻为阿尔德心的卫士们提供建议。院长会对{@i the Borealus}的存在感到惊愕，并为他们获得它而感到高兴。这意味着有机会阻止这个方面，拯救森林。",
	"If Odwald is with the party, he will explain that the aspect must still be weakened in order for {@i the Borealus} to be useful in sealing it. What's more, in order to channel a power as vast as {@i the Borealus} is said to contain, the ritual requires at least two mages working in tandem to succeed. This ritual must be done over the conjuration circle that was used to seal the aspect the first time. Fortunately for them, Odwald knows its location. If Odwald died, the Dean will take over Odwald's role in explaining the information gleaned from the necromancer's ritual notes.": "如果奥德瓦尔德和队伍在一起，他会解释说，为了让{@i the Borealus}在封印中发挥作用，这个方面仍然必须被削弱。更重要的是，为了引导像(1%)所说的那样巨大的力量，这个仪式至少需要两个法师协同工作才能成功。这个仪式必须在第一次用于封印方面的魔法阵上进行。对他们来说，幸运的是，奥德瓦尔德知道它的位置。如果奥德瓦尔德死了，院长将接替奥德瓦尔德的角色，解释从死灵法师的仪式笔记中收集到的信息。",
	"After learning about the ritual, the party will notice a commotion outside the inn. Some people are closing up their shops, others appear to be filing to the city gates with hastily packed bags, some with families in tow, and others still are heading toward the canopy. The party will soon learn the cause, either by asking passersby or listening to town criers, who announce an emergency meeting of all citizenry. The party can investigate, but it won't be long before they receive a summons from the Council. The news is grim: the aspect is moving toward the Great Tree City.": "在了解了这个仪式之后，一行人将注意到旅店外的骚动。有些人正在关闭他们的商店，有些人似乎正带着匆忙收拾好的行李向城门走去，有些人带着家人，还有一些人仍然在向天幕走去。通过询问路人或听镇上的传令兵宣布召开全体市民的紧急会议，党员们很快就会知道原因。队伍可以进行调查，但过不了多久他们就会收到议会的传票。消息是严峻的：方面正在向大树城移动。",
	"Everyone is crowded around the Council Chambers, some literally hanging from branches and filling up every inch of available space. In this sea of faces, the party will see any currently living friendly NPC they might have encountered on their journey who would reasonably be in Alderheart at this time, including: the Dean, Benna, Riffin, Susan, Odwald, Havel, Tevor, Eliza, and the jerbeen orphans.": "每个人都挤在议事厅周围，有些人简直是挂在树枝上，占满了每一寸可用空间。在这片人海中，队伍会看到他们在旅途中可能遇到的任何目前还活着的友好的NPC，他们有理由在这个时候出现在阿尔德心，包括：院长、本纳、里芬、苏珊、奥德瓦尔德、哈维尔、泰沃、伊丽莎，以及杰比恩孤儿。",
	"The citizens are nervous and whispering amongst themselves. Some say they saw an intense red-orange glow far off in the forest, others that Alderheart is under attack, and some are worried the Council will call for an evacuation.": "市民们都很紧张，相互之间窃窃私语。有些人说他们在森林里看到了强烈的橘红色光芒，有些人说奥尔德心受到了攻击，有些人则担心议会会要求疏散。",
	"A contingent of The Spears escorts the members of the Council (including, if appropriate, any newly-elected humblefolk delegates) onto a specially prepared platform with a row of seats and a podium that bears Alderheart's city crest. {@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|Humblewood} appears from out of the ranks of the Council members as they take their seats. A hush falls over the crowd when she approaches the podium:": "一支长矛队护送议会成员（如果合适的话，包括任何新当选的卑鄙小人代表）来到一个特别准备的平台，平台上有一排座位和一个印有Alderheart城徽的讲台。当他们入座时，{@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|Humblewood}从议会成员的队伍中出现。当她走近讲台时，人群中出现了一片嘘声。",
	"\"My fellow citizens, we have just received a dire report from our watchposts. The elemental creature that so recently arose from beneath our Wood now makes its way toward Alderheart.\"": "\"我的同胞们，我们刚刚从我们的观察哨那里收到了一份可怕的报告。最近从我们的森林下出现的元素生物现在正向奥尔德心走来。\"",
	"The citizens may remain silent, or begin to despair. They might even start to panic, at which point the Defenders of Alderheart may step in to help regain control. As symbols of hope in the realm, the crowd will listen to them. Any party member can step up to make a reassuring statement and attempt a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to calm the populace, allowing Speaker Bita to continue. Have a character roll this check with advantage if their reputation has earned them particular favor among the many Alderites (if they are seen as a champion of the people, for example).": "市民们可能保持沉默，或者开始绝望。他们甚至可能开始恐慌，这时，阿尔德心的卫士们可能会介入，帮助重新获得控制。作为王国中希望的象征，人们会听从他们的意见。任何党员都可以站出来做一个令人放心的声明，并尝试用DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查来安抚民众，让比塔议长继续。如果一个角色的名声在众多的Alderites中赢得了特别的好感（例如，如果他们被看作是人民的拥护者），那么让他进行这个检查是有优势的。",
	"Speaker Bita gives the crowd a moment, thanking the Defenders of Alderheart if they provided assistance, then resumes, speaking with a grace and dignity that inspires hope even in these dark times:": "比塔议长给了众人一点时间，如果阿尔德心的捍卫者们提供了援助，就向他们表示感谢，然后继续发言，即使在这黑暗的时代，也能激发人们的希望，充满了优雅和尊严。",
	"\"Recently, we have faced many hardships. The flames that ravaged the Wood have threatened to tear our communities apart. Yet, Alderheart still stands. We are not birdfolk and humblefolk, nor are we perch-dwellers and forest-dwellers: we are people of Humblewood. Since its creation, Alderheart was meant to stand as a symbol of our unity. Perhaps we have lost our way since those early days, but there is still a chance for a brighter future. However, in order to obtain it we must stand together now! I implore each and every citizen of Humblewood, not as the Council Speaker, but as a fellow resident of the Wood. We must defend each other, we must defend Humblewood. It is the only home we have.\"": "\"最近，我们面临许多困难。蹂躏森林的火焰有可能将我们的社区撕碎。然而，阿尔德心仍然屹立不倒。我们不是鸟人和卑微的人，也不是栖息地居民和森林居民：我们是谦卑林的人。自创建以来，Alderheart旨在作为我们团结的象征而存在。也许从早期开始，我们已经迷失了方向，但仍有机会获得一个更光明的未来。然而，为了获得这个机会，我们现在必须团结起来！我恳请每一位阿尔德心的公民都能团结起来。我恳求每一位汉伯伍德的公民，不是作为议会议长，而是作为伍德的同胞。我们必须互相保卫，我们必须保卫汉伯伍德。它是我们唯一的家。\"",
	"Someone starts cheering. Whoever starts the cheer is optional: it may be a humblefolk (perhaps one of the jerbeen orphans, or a reformed bandit working for the Wildwood Brigade), or a birdfolk (maybe Tevor, showing his newfound courage, or Riffin, to inspire the people). This one cry will multiply, and soon the crowd cheers together with one voice, as denizens from all parts of Humblewood unite.": "有人开始欢呼。发起欢呼的人是可有可无的：可能是谦卑人（也许是杰比恩孤儿中的一个，或者是为野林旅工作的改过自新的强盗），或者是鸟人（也许是泰沃，展示他新发现的勇气，或者是瑞芬，以激励人们）。这一声呼喊会成倍增加，很快人群就会用一个声音一起欢呼，因为来自汉伯伍德各个地方的居民都会团结起来。",
	"After Speaker Bita's speech, the party will be found by either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald isn't alive) and told that, by the looks of it, the aspect's influence in this region has grown tenfold since the party's first encounter. If they don't take the opportunity to try and seal the aspect with {@i the Borealus} now, even if it is driven back, the aspect may become too strong to attempt sealing again.": "在比塔议长讲话后，奥德瓦尔德或院长（如果奥德瓦尔德不在世的话）会找到一行人，并告诉他们，从表面上看，自从一行人第一次遇到后，这个地区的影响力已经增长了10倍。如果他们现在不抓住机会尝试用{@i the Borealus}封印这个方面，即使它被赶了回来，这个方面也可能变得太强大而无法再次尝试封印。",
	"The Defenders of Alderheart will soon find their presence requested by the Council: the aspect of fire must be stopped before it reaches the Great Tree City. Its movement has stirred up ashsnakes, emberbats, and other fire creatures that are causing havoc in the surrounding forest. Give the party a chance to explain to the Council what they can do to help (the Council is receptive to most ideas), but if the party doesn't mention sealing away the aspect, then either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald is dead) will make the suggestion.": "阿尔德心的卫士们很快就会发现议会要求他们出席：必须在火焰到达大树城之前阻止它。它的移动激起了灰蛇、琥珀蝙蝠和其他火系生物，在周围的森林中造成了巨大的破坏。给当事人一个机会向议会解释他们能做些什么来帮助他们（议会对大多数想法都能接受），但是如果当事人没有提到封印这个方面，那么奥德瓦尔德或者院长（如果奥德瓦尔德死了）会提出建议。",
	"While the Council will listen to the Dean, Odwald will be looked upon more suspiciously, and the party may need to convince the members on his behalf. To keep the tension high maybe have the party roll Charisma checks for this. The Council will trust the Defenders of Alderheart, even if they don't trust Odwald. However the Council is convinced, Speaker Bita will make it clear in no uncertain terms that the fate of the Wood is in the party's hands.": "委员会会听从院长的意见，而Odwald则会受到更多的怀疑，党员们可能需要为他说服成员们。为了保持高度的紧张感，也许可以让党员们在这方面进行魅力检查。议会将信任阿尔德心的捍卫者，即使他们不信任奥德瓦尔德。无论议会如何说服，比塔议长都会明确表示，森林的命运掌握在党的手中。",
	"Odwald will elaborate that in order to complete the ritual to seal the aspect, two mages must work together to weave a spell into the existing conjuration circle to strengthen and alter its magic. He'll also remind the party of the importance of utilizing cold-type magics to subdue the aspect. Once it has been subdued, they will have only an hour before it regenerates, so it's imperative that the character attuned to {@i the Borealus} brings it to the circle, so the mages can complete the sealing.": "奥德瓦尔德会详细说明，为了完成封印方面的仪式，两名法师必须合作，在现有的魔法阵中编织一个咒语，以加强和改变其魔力。他还会提醒大家利用寒冷型魔法来制服这个方面的重要性。一旦它被制服，在它再生之前，他们只有一个小时的时间，所以当务之急是由与{@i the Borealus}相适应的角色把它带到圈内，以便法师们能够完成封印。",
	"If a spellcasting party member volunteers to help the NPCs prepare the sealing ritual, they will be turned down. Preparing the ritual will be time-consuming and require such focus that the party member wouldn't be able to fight the aspect at the same time. The mages who work the ritual need to rely on the Defenders of Alderheart to ensure their efforts aren't interrupted. Odwald (or the Dean, if Odwald is dead) will explain that the second mage must have a good grasp of arcane theory and precise control over their magic. They will essentially serve as an additional power source and they therefore do not need to have the same familiarity with the ritual.": "如果一个施法的党员自愿帮助NPC准备封印仪式，他们会被拒绝。准备仪式会很耗时，需要如此专注，以至于该党员无法同时与方面作战。从事仪式的法师需要依靠奥尔德之心的保卫者来确保他们的努力不被打断。奥德瓦尔德（如果奥德瓦尔德死了，则是院长）会解释说，第二个法师必须对奥术理论有很好的掌握，并对他们的魔法有精确的控制。他们本质上将作为一个额外的动力源，因此他们不需要对仪式有同样的熟悉度。",
	"Odwald can think of only one other spellcaster he would trust with this ritual: Susan, and he will ask for her to accompany him (if she is alive). Otherwise, the Dean can help. The Dean has a strong desire to see this through to the end, and would gladly work with Odwald for the good of the Wood. If Odwald is dead, the Dean will need assistance for the ritual. Should Susan not be able to assist, a Council member will mention knowing of a talented spellcasting protégé within the Tenders who may be able to help. This is, of course, Havel.": "奥德瓦尔德只能想到一个他信任的施法者来完成这个仪式：苏珊，他将要求她陪同他（如果她还活着的话）。否则，院长可以帮忙。院长有强烈的愿望将此事进行到底，为了森林的利益，他很乐意与奥德瓦尔德合作。如果奥德瓦尔德死了，院长将需要协助进行仪式。如果苏珊不能提供帮助，一位理事会成员会提到知道补天教内有一位有天赋的法术门徒，他可能会提供帮助。当然，这就是哈维尔。",
	"If Odwald is conducting the ritual he will request to have the restraints inhibiting his magic removed, which will cause the Council consternation, but they will ultimately agree.": "如果奥德瓦尔德在主持仪式，他将要求去除抑制他的魔法的束缚，这将引起议会的惊愕，但他们最终会同意。",
	"If the party is still suspicious of Odwald's intentions and unwilling to have his restraints removed, the Dean (who has been looking through Odwald's notes) is familiar enough with the material to lead the ritual. Even so, he'll insist they bring Odwald along, shackled or not, as the corvum's knowledge could prove useful should something go awry.": "如果当事人仍然怀疑Odwald的意图，不愿意解除他的束缚，院长（他一直在翻阅Odwald的笔记）对这种材料足够熟悉，可以领导仪式。即便如此，他还是会坚持让他们把奥德瓦尔德带上，无论是否带着镣铐，因为一旦出现意外，科沃姆的知识会被证明是有用的。",
	"The plan is to have the mages escorted to the conjuration circle, by either the Wildwood Brigade or the Perch Guard, to prepare the ritual. The rest of the Perch Guard and/or Wildwood Brigade will need to work together to keep the path to the aspect cleared for the party.": "我们的计划是让法师们在野林大队或栖息地卫队的护送下前往魔法阵，准备仪式。栖息地卫队和/或野木大队的其他成员将需要合作，以保持通向方面的道路为聚会开辟。",
	"Whoever is leading the ritual indicates that someone will have to grab the aspect's attention and lure it closer to the Grove. If the aspect is too far away when the ritual is completed, there's no guarantee it will be sealed. Scouts report that the aspect is easy to provoke, but it'll be difficult to outpace, and luring it to the Grove will certainly place the volunteer in incredible danger. Riffin volunteers to help draw the aspect back to the circle if he's here, otherwise a Defender of Alderheart has to volunteer for the task. Speed won't matter as much as endurance, since they'll need to be able to withstand whatever the aspect can throw at them in order to make it to the Grove.": "领导仪式的人表示，必须有人抓住这个方面的注意力，引诱它靠近丛林。如果在仪式完成时该方面离得太远，就不能保证它能被封印。侦察员报告说，这个方面很容易被激怒，但它很难被超越，把它引到丛林里肯定会把志愿者置于难以置信的危险之中。如果瑞芬在这里的话，他自愿帮助把这个方面引回圈里，否则就得由奥尔德之心的卫士来自愿完成这个任务。速度并不像耐力那么重要，因为他们需要能够承受那方面的任何东西，以使他们能够到达丛林。",
	"As the party leaves the Council chambers, they will witness something special:": "当一行人离开理事会会议厅时，他们将目睹一些特别的事情。",
	"The mood in the city is electric. Birdfolk and humblefolk from all walks of life work hand-in-hand, with the Perch Guard distributing weapons and armor to any who volunteer. Those who cannot fight are readying supply lines and bucket brigades to help people on the front lines combat forest fires and support the Defenders of Alderheart. Everyone in Alderheart is doing their best to pitch in however they can.": "城市里的气氛很热烈。来自各行各业的鸟人和卑微的人们携手合作，栖息地卫队向任何自愿者分发武器和盔甲。那些不能战斗的人正在准备补给线和水桶队，以帮助前线的人们扑灭森林大火，支持阿尔德心的保卫者。阿尔德心的每个人都在尽其所能地参与其中。",
	"If any characters are looking to prepare for the final fight, the party has a small window to resupply. Many of Alderheart's shops have been closed or abandoned, but the armories of Alderheart are open to the party, allowing them to take whatever supplies they may need (Weapons, Armor, or Adventuring Gear). If they're looking for a little extra, {@adventure Eliza's Emporium|hwcs|2|Eliza's Emporium} is always open, though even in such dire times the party won't be able to get a magic item for free. Eliza is volunteering for the bucket brigade and plans on living through this. While she's still willing to offer \"friends-only\" prices, and supply the party with any non-magical necessities they might need to complete their mission, she has no intention of giving up her livelihood out of fear.": "如果有任何角色想为最后的战斗做准备，队伍有一个小窗口可以补给。Alderheart的许多商店已经关闭或被遗弃，但Alderheart的军械库对他们开放，允许他们携带任何他们可能需要的物资（武器、盔甲或冒险装备）。如果他们想要一点额外的东西，{@adventure Eliza's Emporium|hwcs|2|Eliza's Emporium}总是开放的，虽然即使在这样的危急时刻，队伍也无法免费得到一件魔法物品。伊丽莎是志愿参加水桶队的，并计划通过这个来生活。虽然她仍然愿意提供 \"朋友专用 \"的价格，并为聚会提供他们完成任务可能需要的任何非魔法必需品，但她无意因恐惧而放弃自己的生计。",
	"Before the characters can do battle with the aspect of fire, they must find a way to lure it out of the forest toward the Scorched Grove. This is necessary not only for the ritual, but because the abundance of available fuel in the forest makes the aspect functionally invincible there. Consider having a scout report that the aspect seems to flare up as it burns through the forest, as players may be unaware that the aspect can heal itself using the trees it consumes. While not a vital clue at this stage, this information about the aspect is essential to the fight. If not given the hint, players will have to deduce why the aspect is not weakening when fought in wooded areas.": "在人物与火的方面进行战斗之前，他们必须找到一种方法将它引出森林，引向焦土森林。这不仅对仪式来说是必要的，而且因为森林中丰富的可用燃料使得火的方面在那里是不可战胜的。可以考虑让侦察员报告说，当它在森林中燃烧时，这个方面似乎会爆发，因为玩家可能不知道这个方面可以用它所消耗的树木来治疗自己。虽然在这个阶段不是一个重要的线索，但是关于这个方面的信息对战斗是至关重要的。如果没有得到提示，玩家将不得不推断出为什么在林区战斗时该方面的力量没有减弱。",
	"If Riffin volunteered to lure the aspect of fire into the Grove, skip to {@adventure Facing the Aspect|hwcs|5|Facing the Aspect}.": "如果瑞芬自愿引诱火的方面进入丛林，请跳到（%0%）。",
	"If Riffin wasn't around to volunteer, the player character who volunteered to bait the aspect will accompany a unit of Perch Guard or Wildwood Brigade scouts into the part of the forest where the aspect is advancing. In the meantime, the rest of the party and the mages will be escorted to the conjuration circle to ready for the aspect's arrival. It isn't necessary for more than one party member to serve as bait, and if multiple characters volunteer then either Odwald or the Dean will advise against it, insisting that the rest of the party will need their strength to fight the aspect.": "如果瑞芬不在身边，自愿诱捕方面的玩家角色将陪同一支鲈鱼护卫队或野林旅的侦察兵进入方面正在推进的森林部分。同时，其余的人和法师将被护送到魔法阵中，准备迎接该方面的到来。没有必要让一个以上的党员充当诱饵，如果多个角色自愿，那么奥德瓦尔德或院长会建议不要这样做，坚持认为党的其他成员需要他们的力量来对抗这个方面。",
	"Separated from their friends, read to the player that volunteered:": "与他们的朋友分开，向自愿参加的玩家阅读。",
	"Around you, you can see woodland denizens of all kinds fighting. Parts of the forest are ablaze. Bucket brigades desperately try to keep the fires in check while coordinated teams assault massive ashsnakes and use specially-crafted nets to drive back swarms of emberbats. The scouts lead you further into the brush, until you can see the blazing form of the aspect lumbering toward Alderheart. It hasn't yet spotted you or your guides in your hiding place.": "在你周围，你可以看到各种类型的林地居民在战斗。部分森林被烧毁了。水桶队拼命地试图控制火势，而协调小组则攻击巨大的灰蛇，并使用特别制作的网来驱赶成群的琥珀蝙蝠。侦察员带领你进一步进入灌木丛，直到你能看到那只熊熊燃烧着的方面朝Alderheart蹒跚而来。它还没有发现你和你的向导在你的藏身之处。",
	"The aspect of fire will give chase as soon as it sees the volunteer character, hurling hunks of magma at the lone hero. Rather than resolving this engagement using movement speed, resolve the chase through the ash covered-forest by having the pursued character make a DC 18 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) or Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to keep ahead of the aspect and avoid taking damage. On a failure, have the player make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@dice 4d10}) fire damage on a failure, and half as much on a success. The character being chased can take one other action in addition to making their check, but they can do nothing else since the rest of their energies are focused on the flight.": "火焰方面一看到志愿者角色就会追赶，向孤独的英雄投掷大量的岩浆。与其用移动速度来解决这个问题，不如让被追赶的角色做一个DC18的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）或力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查，以保持领先于火的一面并避免受到伤害，从而解决在灰烬覆盖的森林中的追赶。如果失败，让玩家进行DC 16的灵巧救赎，失败时受到22 ({@dice 4d10}的火力伤害，成功时受到一半的伤害。被追赶的角色除了做检查外，还可以采取一个其他行动，但他们不能做其他事情，因为他们的其他精力都集中在飞行上。",
	"If a player decides to attack the aspect during this chase, resolve their attack as normal, but the aspect won't take any damage. The character should see that once the aspect moves through a stand of trees, its fire consumes the trees, causing it to regain health and blaze brightly.": "如果玩家决定在这个追逐过程中攻击这个方面，就像正常情况下一样解决他们的攻击，但这个方面不会受到任何伤害。角色应该看到，一旦这个方面穿过一片树丛，它的火焰就会吞噬树木，使它恢复健康并发出耀眼的光芒。",
	"The character being chased must succeed on four of the above {@skill Athletics} checks to lure the aspect toward the conjuration circle. Resolve each failure as it happens. Once the character being chased succeeds on two Dexterity or Strength checks, or is doing poorly, Riffin will appear, shielding the character from a hit and preventing the damage. From this point on, Riffin will protect the character from further harm.": "被追赶的角色必须在上述四次（%0%）检查中成功，以引诱对方走向魔法阵。每一次失败都会被解决。一旦被追赶的角色在两次灵巧或力量检查中成功，或者表现不佳，Riffin就会出现，为角色挡住一击并防止伤害。从此时起，Riffin将保护该角色免受进一步的伤害。",
	"As the fireball hurtles toward you, you see a flash of steel and suddenly find yourself shielded from the blast. Looking over, you can see Riffin, running alongside you with his shield held high. The face of his shield emits a barrier of wind which deflects the aspect's flames. The small strig gives you a smile and shouts, \"Sorry I didn't help sooner, but I'm not about to let the whole Wood burn! Riffin the Ash-Knight, at your service.\"": "当火球冲向你时，你看到一道钢铁的闪光，突然发现自己被挡住了爆炸。看过去，你可以看到瑞芬，他高举着盾牌与你并肩奔跑。他的盾牌的表面发出一道风的屏障，使方面的火焰偏移。这个小家伙给了你一个微笑，并喊道：\"对不起，我没有早点帮忙，但我不会让整个森林被烧毁！\"。灰烬骑士瑞芬，为你服务。\"",

	"Only the 40 feet of tree cover to the south is substantial enough for the aspect to heal using its \"Fuel for the Fire\" ability.": "只有南边的40英尺的树木覆盖物足够大，可以让该方面使用其 \"火的燃料 \"能力进行治疗。",

You feel the opposing elemental forces grate against each other as you reach the circle's center.": "在圆圈内围绕着你的热量是很强烈的，但感觉好像{@i the Borealus}正在反击它。当你到达圆圈的中心时，你感觉到对立的元素力量在互相磨擦。",
	"Upon reaching the center, either Odwald or Dean Windsworth will give the signal to plant the staff into the earth. The moment {@i the Borealus} hits the ground, a stream of energy shoots out and surrounds the petrified aspect. Once enveloped, the aspect begins to lose its physical form, becoming one with the energy around it. Suddenly, the flow of energy is pulled back into the ritual circle. Immediately, the heat will dissipate and a wave of pressure will emanate from the circle, knocking anyone within 500 feet who is not inside of the circle {@condition prone}.": "到达中心后，奥德瓦尔德或温兹沃思院长将发出信号，将法杖插入大地。在{@i the Borealus}落地的那一刻，一股能量射出，包围了石化的一面。一旦被包围，该方面开始失去其物理形态，与周围的能量融为一体。突然间，能量流被拉回仪式圈内。随即，热力消散，一股压力从圈内发出，将500英尺内不在圈内的人击倒（1%）。",
	"For a moment there is calm, but during this time the mages still struggle. The energies that crackle from their hands feed into the circle, which once again begins to flare. The ritual has been enacted, but something is wrong. There isn't enough power. {@i The Borealus'} long confinement has left it too weak to provide the required energy. Reaching the required level of power can only be done at a cost: someone will need to give their life in order to complete the ritual.": "有那么一刻是平静的，但在这段时间里，法师们仍然在挣扎。从他们手中噼啪作响的能量流入圆圈，圆圈再次开始燃烧。仪式已经完成，但有些事情是错误的。没有足够的力量。{@i The Borealus'}长期的禁锢让它太弱了，无法提供所需的能量。要达到所需的能量水平，只能付出代价：为了完成仪式，有人需要献出自己的生命。",
	"{@b {@i If Odwald is alive,}} any party member with the ability to cast spells, or the party member attuned to {@i the Borealus}, can volunteer. However, even if they do Odwald will insist upon being the one to give up his life. It was his mistakes that got the Wood into this mess, so in his eyes it's only fair that he forfeit his life. There is no time to argue, and if another character volunteers and refuses to back down, Odwald will appear to acquiesce, only to sacrifice himself at the last minute and save them. As the blaze of the ritual fire consumes him, Odwald will thank the hero for helping him find some measure of peace.": "{@b {@i If Odwald is alive,}}任何有能力施法的党员，或与{@i the Borealus}相适应的党员，都可以自愿参加。然而，即使他们这样做，奥德瓦尔德也会坚持做那个放弃生命的人。是他的错误让伍德陷入了这种困境，所以在他眼里，他放弃自己的生命才是公平的。没有时间争论，如果另一个角色自愿并拒绝退缩，奥德瓦尔德会显得很默契，只是在最后一刻牺牲自己，拯救他们。当仪式的烈火吞噬他时，奥德瓦尔德会感谢英雄帮助他找到某种程度的平静。",
	"{@b {@i If Odwald is dead,}} the Dean will offer to sacrifice himself, though he won't protest if a player takes his place. Either way, the Dean or the player in the ritual circle will see Odwald's ghost supplying them with even more power. Miraculously, Odwald will keep the sacrificial character alive.": "{@b {@i If Odwald is dead,}}院长会提出牺牲自己，不过如果有玩家代替他，他也不会抗议。无论怎样，院长或祭祀圈中的玩家都会看到奥德瓦尔德的鬼魂为他们提供更多的力量。神奇的是，奥德瓦尔德会让牺牲的角色活着。",
	"The final moments of the ritual begins:": "仪式的最后时刻开始了。",
	"The land around the Grove quakes, as both the conjuring circle and {@i the Borealus} within are consumed in a harmonious white light. The ground beneath the seal shakes and swells, rising from the ashen plain as though it were a living creature. Those outside the circle can see the mound thrash, momentarily assuming the form of the aspect. It lashes out in fury, before its shape melts away into the earth, which rises still. Then, without warning, everything stops. The quakes cease, leaving a tranquil hill on the ashen plain.": "丛林周围的土地都在颤抖，因为魔法阵和里面的%0%都被和谐的白光所吞噬。封印下的地面摇晃和膨胀，从灰暗的平原中升起，仿佛它是一个活的生物。圈子外的人可以看到土丘在颤动，瞬间变成了那方面的形态。它愤怒地挥舞着拳头，然后它的形状融化在大地中，大地静静地升起。然后，没有警告，一切都停止了。地震停止了，在灰暗的平原上留下一座宁静的小山。",
	"Anyone inside the circle, including any sacrifice (besides Odwald), can be found unconscious at the top of the hill. Both {@i the Borealus} and the aspect are gone, and from atop the hill a single sapling grows. The threat to the Wood has ended.": "任何在圈内的人，包括任何牺牲品（除了奥德瓦尔德），都可以在山顶上发现昏迷的人。{@i the Borealus}和方面都消失了，从山顶上长出一棵树苗。对森林的威胁已经结束。",

	"After the final battle, the characters will return to Alderheart to the cheer and jubilation of all. The Wood has been badly scarred, but once the aspect was sealed, the creatures assailing the forest fled back toward the Grove, and much of the Wood survives. In the coming days the characters can recover from their wounds and finish up any unresolved points they might have in their character arcs before the Council summons them to a ceremony celebrating their momentous feat.": "在最后的战斗之后，角色们将在所有人的欢呼和喜悦中回到阿尔德心。森林已经被严重破坏了，但是一旦方面被封印，袭击森林的生物就会逃回丛林，森林的大部分地区都会幸存下来。在接下来的日子里，角色们可以从他们的伤口中恢复过来，并在议会召集他们参加庆祝他们的重大壮举的仪式之前完成他们的角色弧线中可能存在的任何未解决的要点。",
	"Each character is given a medal bearing Alderheart's crest, and their choice of either a {@item blade of the wood|Humblewood}, {@item wing crest shield|Humblewood}, {@item red-feather bow|Humblewood}, or {@item feathered helm|Humblewood}. These rewards should be decided upon before the ceremony, and made to the character's exact specifications (so long as they fit within what the weapons could be. For example, the blade of the wood might be a rapier or a greatsword, but it would need to be a sword). If the {@item feathered helm|Humblewood} is selected, the player can choose which race of birdfolk the feather is sourced from:": "每个角色都会得到一枚印有Alderheart徽章的奖章，以及他们选择的{@item blade of the wood|Humblewood}、{@item wing crest shield|Humblewood}、{@item red-feather bow|Humblewood}或{@item feathered helm|Humblewood}。这些奖励应在仪式前决定，并按照角色的确切规格制作（只要符合武器的用途就可以了。例如，木头的刀片可能是一把剑或一把大剑，但它需要是一把剑）。如果选择{@item feathered helm|Humblewood}，玩家可以选择羽毛的来源是哪个种族的鸟人。",
	"If a corvum feather, it will have been one recovered from Odwald before his sacrifice—or if this doesn't make sense, one donated by Professor Revayne.": "如果是科沃姆羽毛，那将是在奥德瓦尔德牺牲前从他身上找到的，如果这不合理，那就是雷文教授捐赠的羽毛。",

	"If there are any custom birdfolk NPCs, especially ones with whom the players have an affinity, consider having the feather come from one of them instead. A birdfolk party member may also donate a feather for the helm.

	"Within a few months, the parts of the Wood that were recently consumed by the Scorched Grove return to normal, and the creatures of the Grove return to their natural ranges. As the forest heals, new settlements are constructed for those who wish to return to their lives on the forest floor.

Ashbarrow will recover its former beauty and provide a home for those who were forced to abandon it.": "在几个月内，森林中最近被焦土森林吞噬的部分恢复了正常，森林中的生物也回到了它们的自然范围。随着森林的愈合，新的定居点被建造出来，供那些希望回到森林地面生活的人居住。虽然不可能取代在大火中失去的一切，但这些家园最终会发展成新的社区。瑞芬将回到阿什巴罗，并加入帮助恢复工作的行列。阿什巴罗将恢复它以前的美丽，为那些被迫放弃它的人提供一个家。",

	"After much deliberation, the new Humblewood Council has been established, and includes humblefolk delegates for a handful of prominent forest-dwelling communities. The Perch of Marshview has a humblefolk delegate, as the predominantly grounded settlement's birdfolk representative was replaced in a landslide vote. Council Speaker Bita retains her position, to the applause of a far more inclusive Alderheart.": "经过长时间的讨论，新的谦卑林议会已经成立，其中包括少数几个著名的林居社区的谦卑人代表。沼泽景区的鲈鱼有一个卑微的代表，因为这个以接地气为主的定居点的鸟人代表在压倒性的投票中被取代。议会议长比塔保留了她的职位，并得到了更具包容性的奥尔德之心的掌声。",

	"{@b {@i If Benna was killed,}} she has since become a folk hero among certain groups of forest-dwellers. She was seen as the one who could have helped cast aside the oppressive yoke of the perches and bring about a true redistribution of power in the Wood. This is a change that is sorely needed, and now that forest refugees have fought side by side with the Alderites, many are pushing for a true reform of the Birdfolk Council. The hope is to transform it into something that also represents delegates from outside the perches. The popular support for change means it will likely happen, even though there are already signs that most of the powerful nobles in Alderheart are opposed to the change.": "{@b {@i If Benna was killed,}}她从此成为某些森林居民群体中的民间英雄。她被视为能够帮助抛开栖息地的压迫性枷锁，在森林中实现真正的权力再分配的人。这是一个非常需要的改变，现在森林难民已经与阿尔德里特人并肩作战，许多人正在推动鸟人委员会的真正改革。希望能将其转变为也能代表来自栖息地以外的代表的东西。民众对改革的支持意味着它可能会发生，尽管已经有迹象表明阿尔德心的大多数有权势的贵族都反对这一变革。",

	"The Scorched Grove has shrunk in recent months, owing to the efforts of Tenders as much as the sealing of the aspect. While the Grove will remain part of Humblewood for the foreseeable future, the ash in its plains no longer burns with embers, reducing the frequency of fires in the Wood. The ashsnakes that appeared with the aspect remain, and have filled new niches in the ecology of the Grove, due to the snake's ability to survive on the energy of consumed elementals and beasts. The ashsnakes help keep some of the more dangerous fire-based creatures at bay. This has greatly helped the Tenders, who now see the ashsnakes as something to be respected from a distance, but not feared. Plants are growing on the lonely hill which marks the final resting place of the aspect of fire, and the sapling which sprouted from its top is quickly growing into a tree. It has been named \"The Healing Hill,\" and is watched over by the Tenders as a sacred site.": "近几个月来，由于投标人的努力以及方面的密封，焦土林已经缩小了。虽然丛林在可预见的未来仍是汉伯伍德的一部分，但其平原上的灰烬不再与余烬一起燃烧，减少了森林中火灾的频率。随着这个方面出现的灰蛇仍然存在，并在丛林的生态中填补了新的位置，因为蛇有能力依靠被消耗的元素和野兽的能量生存。灰蛇有助于阻止一些更危险的火系生物。这极大地帮助了投标人，他们现在把灰蛇看作是应该从远处尊重的东西，而不是畏惧。孤山上的植物正在生长，它标志着火的方面的最后安息地，从山顶上发芽的树苗正在迅速成长为一棵树。它被命名为 \"愈合之山\"，并作为一个神圣的地方由Tenders看管。",
	"One night, a player's character, will have strange dreams. In the dreams, they encounter Odwald.

If they could cause such destruction in Humblewood, what might happen to Everden if they're still out there?": "一天晚上，一个玩家的角色，会做一些奇怪的梦。在梦中，他们遇到了奥德瓦尔德。他的形式是幽灵，他似乎有话要说，但在他能传授任何新的智慧之前，角色就醒了。欺骗他释放方面的实体是谁？如果他们能在Humblewood造成如此大的破坏，如果他们还在外面，Everden会发生什么？",
	"Not an officially recognized college, the College of the Road represents the personal and eclectic sets of skills, knowledge, and techniques a wandering bard picks up along their journey. As inveterate jacks-of-all-trades, bards possess a variety of aptitudes in combat, magecraft, and general know-how, making them particularly well suited to learning a variety of different skills. It often happens that while traveling, a bard winds up sharing their campfire with a motley assortment of wandering adventurers who may impart valuable lessons in exchange for a lively song or a well-told tale. Compared to students of other Bard Colleges, a special kind of sensibility is important for the College of the Road. How effectively a bard of this College can apply what they have learned depends on their understanding and insight.
