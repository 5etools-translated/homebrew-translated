	"The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behaviour stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.": "刺猬是所有卑微的人中最有外交手腕和天性的，它们喜欢在整个森林的村庄里过着安静的生活，或者在鸟人的安全栖息地里。它们类似于刺猬，尽管覆盖在它们背上的毛刺要坚硬得多，坚硬得足以击退刀片，锋利得足以刺穿怪物的坚固皮毛。尽管它们很结实，但刺猬是敏感而情绪化的生物，它们表现出的温顺多于虚张声势。他们在社交场合的温顺举止和恭敬态度为他们赢得了在外人眼中是懦夫的声誉。但他们的行为并不是出于胆怯，而是源于尊重他人的感受和敏感度的愿望，这在绿篱社会中被认为是最重要的。",
	"Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.": "赫德人有一种难以置信的同情能力，并倾向于将所有的生物，从最小的甲虫到最大的野兽，都视为同样值得尊重和尊严。他们因是优秀的冲突调解员而闻名于整个森林，通常发现自己在各派别之间充当外交官或使者，试图促成一项协议。",
	"Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.": "当每个人都相处融洽时，赫德人感到最自在。他们是少数几个真正理解冲突不是邪恶力量的种族之一，而只是代表一种必须解决的不平衡现象。这并不是说绿篱从未经历过纷争，只是说他们积极主动的调解方式，加上他们对所有生物的尊严的深深尊重，导致冲突的场合较少。然而，当严重的冲突出现时，感觉自己受到真正的、深刻的伤害的绿篱会把自己与社会的其他部分隔离开来，有时会导致社区的分裂。",
	"One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.": "绿篱对他人表现出如此深刻的同情和怜悯的原因之一，是由于它们感受到的情绪的强度。这些情感的强度既适用于积极的情感，也适用于消极的情感，这意味着绿篱的情感创伤很深。",
	"Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus.

It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.": "绿篱被赋予了与大韵律的独特联系，它与自然界的联系类似于一些胆小鬼所拥有的联系。这赋予了绿篱特殊的魔法天赋，如与森林中最小的地栖生物对话的能力，以及使花朵绽放的能力。对绿篱来说，拥有各种动物朋友分享他们的家园是很常见的。",
	"Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.": "住在鸟人城市之外的绿篱喜欢住在大树根下的独立洞穴里。绿篱社区喜欢生活在大自然中，靠近森林中的空地或孤独的小树林。中央会议区和公共花园可以建在洞穴之间的空间。绿篱喜欢园艺，并倾向于在它们居住的地方保留一些小花园。",
	"Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge's clothing.": "灌木在穿衣服时需要特别考虑，喜欢宽松的长衫、宽松的裤子、飘逸的长袍和其他容易盖住它们的毛刺的衣服。当不主动伸出羽毛时，这些坚韧的羽毛会自然变平，变得触感光滑。然而，如果突然受到惊吓，它们的羽毛会反射性地张开并变硬，这种意外会毁掉绿篱的衣服。",
	"Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge's needs.": "专门为树篱制作的冒险服几乎在汉伯伍德的每个主要城市都能买到，整个伍德的裁缝都熟悉如何进行修改以适应树篱的需要。",

Jerbeens have a strong sense of family and like to surround themselves with good company wherever they rest.": "杰比恩是一种类似老鼠的小动物，有长长的、毛茸茸的尾巴，可以帮助它们保持平衡。与它们身体的其他部分相比，杰比恩的腿长而有力。杰比恩可以在整个森林的各种地方找到，通常在鸟人的栖息地和卑微的村庄里形成自己的社区。他们很少单独居住。一个Jerbeen的家可以包含几代人，包括大家庭和堂兄弟姐妹一起生活在一个屋檐下。杰比恩人有强烈的家庭意识，并且喜欢在他们休息的地方与好伙伴在一起。",
	"Jerbeens are the smallest inhabitants of Humblewood, dwarfed by nearly every kind of creature they encounter. While they are quick and nimble, and possess an affable attitude, they are not very strong, brave, or powerful on their own. When they stand with a group, jerbeens are emboldened: the presence of others reassures them, granting them the courage to face even the largest threats head on. They excel in team strategies, helping one another solve problems that could not be surmounted alone.": "Jerbeens是Humblewood最小的居民，几乎被他们遇到的每一种生物都弄得矮小。虽然他们行动敏捷，态度和蔼，但他们自己并不强壮、勇敢或强大。当他们和一群人站在一起时，Jerbeens就会胆大起来：其他人的存在让他们感到安心，给予他们勇气去面对甚至是最大的威胁。他们擅长团队策略，互相帮助，解决那些无法单独克服的问题。",
	"The communal slant of jerbeens stems from more than just their love of good company: jerbeen are kind and considerate creatures, known for their joviality and charm. Being small and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst possible fate a jerbeen could suffer.": "Jerbeens的公共倾向不仅仅源于他们对好伙伴的热爱：Jerbeen是一种善良和体贴的生物，以其欢快和魅力而闻名。身材矮小且不是特别强壮给了他们一个视角，使他们能够轻松地同情他人，尽管不是所有的杰比恩都有这种同情心。有些人对他们社区外的危险作出反应，变得孤僻，害怕所有非杰尔宾人。杰比恩人重视隐私，但与朋友、家人或亲人的真正隔离被认为是杰比恩人可能遭受的最糟糕的命运。",
	"Mapachs mature quickly, reaching adulthood around 8 years. Despite this they have fairly average lifespans, the oldest among them living just past 60 years.": "马帕奇人成熟得很快，在8年左右达到成年。尽管如此，他们的寿命相当平均，其中最年长的人刚过60岁。",
	"Mapachs don't favour good over evil, with most choosing to remain neutral. They also lean towards the freedom of chaotic alignments.": "马帕奇人并不偏向于正邪，大多数人选择保持中立。他们也倾向于自由的混沌结盟。",
	"Mapachs stand between 4 and 5 feet tall, and encompass a variety of builds from svelt to wide, weighing between 90 and 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "马帕奇人的身高在4至5英尺之间，身材从瘦小到宽大都有，体重在90至160磅之间。你的尺寸是中等。",
	"You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Mapachs are most comfortable under the cloak of night.": "你可以在你周围60英尺内的昏暗光线下看东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中看东西就像昏暗的光线一样。你在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。马帕奇人在夜幕的笼罩下最为舒适。",
	"You have a climb speed of 20 feet.": "你的爬升速度为20英尺。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.": "你对毒药的救赎有优势，对毒药伤害有抵抗力。",
	"You are proficient with {@item tinker's tools}. Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but functional versions of common items using materials present in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30 gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart.": "你精通（%0%）。此外，你有能力利用你周围的材料建造粗糙但实用的普通物品。你可以花10分钟将这些材料制作成任何价值30金币或以下的工具或冒险装备。该物品将是完全实用的，甚至能够作为一种伪装（如果你制作的是一件衣服）。工具，以及任何其他在第一次使用时就会破损的物品（卡尔特罗，箭），在之后都会变得无用。否则，手工制作的物品将持续1个小时才会散架。",
	"Depending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.": "根据现有的材料，游戏管理员（GM）可能会规定你不能以这种方式制作物品。例如，如果你碰巧在酸性甲虫幼虫的巢穴附近，酸液瓶可能很容易制作，或者树皮可以被捆绑成一个临时的烧瓶，但是用一堆树叶制作一个合格的丝质长袍的模型就很难了。",
	"Should you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance. You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand. Though, how long your repairs hold together is up to the GM.": "如果你能得到适当的材料，你可以花8个小时将你用这种方式搜刮来的物品转化为永久版本，只要你在物品散架之前开始这个过程。以这种方式制作的物品将与正常版本的物品完全一样，如果你熟练掌握了制作工具，它们甚至可以看起来像专业制作的。否则，它们会保留一个相当粗糙的、拼凑起来的外观。你也可以用 \"拾荒 \"的方式来修复损坏的设备，只要你手头有材料。不过，你的修理能维持多久，要看GM的意思。",
	"You have advantage on {@skill Stealth} checks made in dim light and darkness.": "你在昏暗的光线和黑暗中进行的检查有优势（%0%）。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Mapach.": "你可以说、读、写Birdfolk和Mapach。",

	"Naturally curious, mapachs are a medium-sized racoon-like race. They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn't diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric.": "天生好奇的马帕奇是一个中型的浣熊类种族。他们狡猾、健壮、坚韧，但他们真正的力量在于他们在观察周围世界时看到的潜力。马帕奇人的手非常轻巧，精细的运动控制能力也很强，不会随着年龄的增长而减弱。他们还善于攀爬和潜行。这一点，再加上他们对小饰品的喜爱，为他们赢得了一个当之无愧的小偷声誉。虽然也有例外，但大多数马帕奇人都是相当善良的，即使有点怪癖。",
	"Mapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions, and at intuiting the right course of action when faced with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportunities rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them. Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings. Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by obvious traps.": "马帕奇善于在艰难的林地条件下生存，并且在面临问题时能凭直觉采取正确的行动方案。它们也是不折不扣的机会主义者。有些人可能会认为他们很粗鲁，但Mapachs知道机会很少出现，并会迅速采取行动。马帕奇人很警觉，对周围环境有敏锐的认识。只有他们中真正愚蠢的人才会被明显的陷阱所迷惑。",
	"One of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as \"scroungecraft\", and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.": "地图客最出名的特征之一是他们能够为任何东西找到用途。这种从碎片、垃圾或手头材料中创造出功能性或有用物品的诀窍被称为 \"拾荒术\"，是mapachs中的一种文化支柱。这种活动被认为是一种艺术形式，与其他民族的高级艺术相提并论。拾荒展示了创造力、聪明才智和足智多谋，但却被外人误解，认为是原始或粗糙的行为。由地图绘制者创造的天才想法往往是从拾荒者的原型开始的。许多建造了这种有趣或独特作品的人在马帕奇人中取得了名人地位，并在松散组织的scroungecraft展览会上展示他们的技能。",
	"Mapachs are often loners, but when they do establish communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart's pulley system was based. The pulley system was so successful that birdfolk perches beyond Alderheart have adopted the technology.": "马帕奇人常常是独来独往，但当他们与卑微的人或鸟人建立社区时，他们有一个习惯，就是无论走到哪里都会促进创新。马帕奇人的聪明才智是Alderheart的滑轮系统所依据的装置。这个滑轮系统非常成功，以至于阿尔德心以外的鸟人栖息地都采用了这项技术。",
	"Vulpins mature at an average pace, and can be comparatively long-lived. They reach adulthood at 15 years, and live well past 90 years.": "黄鼠狼以平均速度成熟，而且可以比较长寿。它们在15岁时达到成年，并能活到90岁以上。",
	"Vulpins aren't innately evil, but their difficulty empathizing with others means they are only rarely good aligned. Most vulpins find strict authority distasteful, preferring chaotic alignments over lawful ones.": "秃鹰人并非天生邪恶，但他们很难与他人产生共鸣，这就意味着他们很少会向善。大多数秃鹰人认为严格的权威令人厌恶，他们更喜欢混乱的结盟而不是合法的结盟。",

	"Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn't entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.": "秃鹰的外形像狐狸，身材轻盈，獠牙锋利。秃鹰是森林中最不被理解和最常被诋毁的卑鄙小人之一，它赢得了一个并不完全应得的坏名声。这在很大程度上是由于秃鹰的雄心勃勃的事实。有时，他们成功的动力会使他们难以与他人产生共鸣。秃鹰和其他木族人一样有深刻的感受，但他们拥有敏锐的生存本能，有时会导致他们采取自私的行动。此外，他们敏锐而精明，拥有一种不可思议的人格力量，使他们能够轻易地动摇他人的信任。在正确的情况下，秃鹰可以成为真正的朋友，而在错误的情况下则是致命的敌人。",
	"Vulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others.": "秃鹰是天生的聪明人，只有科威姆能与之匹敌。然而，在科沃姆人好学的地方，秃鹰更有创造力。他们喜欢艺术和对休闲的追求。有些人一生都在掌握一种艺术形式；学习雕塑、诗歌或精致的剑术。尽管秃鹰来自各行各业，但他们也有势利眼和看不起别人的名声。",
	"All vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence.": "所有的秃鹰都与木之魔法有着天然的联系，尽管他们以特殊的方式引导它。秃鹰的正确眼神可以迷惑人，也可以让人害怕，而真正熟练的秃鹰可以通过纯粹的力量指挥整个房间。",
	"Before the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike.

There is nothing a gallus would not give to their neighbors in a time of need.": "高卢雄鸡是一种社会性和公共性的民俗。无论他们在哪里栖息，都倾向于形成紧密的社区，他们对自己社区的自豪感很深。当悲剧使他们村里的孩子成为孤儿时，按照惯例，Gallus家庭会收留他们。胆小鬼重视诚实的工作，如耕作和铁匠，并在所有社区成员之间平等分享劳动。在需要的时候，没有什么是加洛人不愿意给他们的邻居的。",
	"While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point of being socially exploitable. The gallus have an ear for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies and dishonesty.": "虽然其他鸟人可能会因为他们的普通方式而看不起gallus，但gallus有出色的人际交往能力。他们很有洞察力和同情心，但不至于在社会上被利用。胆小鬼有一双听真话的耳朵，而且常常能够根除谎言和不诚实的行为。",

	"Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colours, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.": "在谈到他们在鲈鱼社会中的作用时，卢马人是一个极端对立的种族。他们经常因为自己的怪癖而被回避，也因为这些怪癖而被赞美。卢马人比大多数鸟人要小，像鸽子或鸽子。许多人的羽毛围脖闪耀着独特的彩虹色，这可以被视为诱人或不寻常的东西。大多数初出茅庐的鲁玛人在接近社交场合时都会犹豫不决，直到有一天社会不可避免地给他们贴上弃儿或知名人士的标签时，个人就会自然地适应这个角色。",
	"To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.": "对大多数人来说，鲁玛人似乎永远都是杂乱无章、心不在焉的，这导致人们认为他们的智力很低。事实上，鲁玛人对世界有独特的感知。他们能够以一种不寻常的方式解释信息，使他们能够看到其他人无法看到的可能性。",

Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.": "这些与生俱来的天赋，有时被认为是运气，可以通过训练和学习来提高。将他们的天赋与魔法教育结合起来，强大的卢马巫师和激进的学者们在汉伯伍德的一段时间内一直处于魔法创新的前沿。",
	"While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.": "虽然大多数鲁玛人发现他们的奇特天性在社会上是一种障碍，但有些人利用他们的天赋来攀登社会阶梯。这些人激发了人们的好奇心，在他们身上有一种权威的气息。鲁玛人之间的这种社会地位的分化会使家庭和朋友之间的关系变得好奇和紧张。",
	"Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.": "其他鲁玛人发现在鸟人城市的大社会中很难生存。据说这也是大型城市中卢马人紧密团结、独占鳌头的一个主要因素。卢马人倾向于独来独往，更喜欢和那些理解他们的人在一起，而不是那些评头论足的人。",

These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.": "当鸟人想到猎人或护林员时，他们会想到猛禽。他们类似于小鹰、老鹰和其他猛禽，拥有锋利的爪子和敏捷的身材，帮助他们毫不费力地在树冠上滑行。这些鸟人敏捷而强壮，有一种不可思议的追踪技巧。它们很少成为猎物，当发现自己被猎杀时，它们会迅速扭转局面。",
	"Given their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have an extremely wide field of awareness.": "鉴于其高度的感官，猛禽往往看起来心不在焉或陷入深思。实际上，它们正在处理从它们特别敏锐的眼睛和敏感的耳朵中得到的大量感官信息。虽然许多人只知道他们周围发生的事情，但猛禽有一个非常广泛的意识领域。",
	"Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for their perches. Raptors are especially well versed in stalking prey from great heights, lining up impossible shots that their prey could not predict.": "猛禽善于在土地上生活。它们是熟练的猎手，通常领导收获肉和皮的栖息地。猛禽尤其擅长从高处跟踪猎物，排成不可能的镜头，让猎物无法预测。",
	"While many of the birdfolk races are culturally communal, raptors don't have a great sense of connectedness, nor do they tend to create their own perches. They are more likely to adopt a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply live in the vast forests of the Wood itself.": "虽然许多鸟人种族在文化上是共有的，但猛禽并没有很大的联系感，它们也不倾向于创造自己的栖息地。它们更有可能采取一种短暂的生活方式，从一个栖息地搬到另一个栖息地，或者干脆生活在森林本身的广阔森林中。",
	"Though typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature, raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even familial ties.": "虽然通常很安静，但猛禽并不排斥与其他鸟类朋友建立关系。尽管它们的天性很矜持，但猛禽对个人关系的重视程度比社会关系甚至家庭关系都要高。",

	"Cervans are a versatile deer-like folk who make their homes in small, intimate villages throughout Humblewood.

	"Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to positions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.": "塞万人拥有强健的体魄，很少生病。他们是卑微的人类中最长寿的种族之一。虽然他们的警惕性为他们赢得了胆小的名声，但塞万人之所以谨慎，是因为他们保持着活跃和警觉，而且通常喜欢实践而不是沉思。塞万人喜欢独立追求技能，以便给自己一种目标感。这种努力是推动一些塞尔凡人在整个森林中担任重要职务的原因。一个快乐的塞万人是一个努力工作的人。",
	"One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.": "塞万人形成如此紧密的社区的原因之一是对外来者的不信任。在《条约》签订之前，Vulpin突袭者和Mapach盗贼是严重的威胁。这些时代早已过去，但塞万人仍然拥有一种戒心，使其他人很难获得他们的信任。在《谦卑人条约》实施后，许多塞万人继续按照旧的方式生活。然而，一些塞万人的村庄从此开始包含零星的jerbeen家庭，或一些孤独的树篱。即使在这种情况下，塞万人仍然保持着领导地位，并委以重任，确保村庄按照塞万人的古老教义进行管理，确保完成最偏远村庄生存所需的工作，使其所有居民保持健康和快乐。",
	"The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans' greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one's options. The best cervan leaders favour this approach.": "平衡他们与生俱来的谨慎和实际考虑的能力是塞万斯人最大的优势之一。塞万人教导说，在任何情况下，最好的生存手段是保持冷静并权衡自己的选择。最好的塞万族领导人赞成这种方法。",
	"Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as \"The Sight\", this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as \"The Sighted\", and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.": "塞万人有一种独特的能力，可以反弹并在可能杀死其他人的身体冲击中幸存下来。偶尔，在这种创伤中幸存下来的塞万斯人被赋予神秘的幻觉。有时，这些是对他们周围世界的洞察力的闪光，有时是厄运的预兆，有时是对遥远未来的憧憬。这种现象在塞万人中被称为 \"视力\"，难以捉摸，而且不受凡人控制。以这种方式看到异象的塞万斯人被称为 \"视力\"，在这个最初的事件之后，有些人会突然发现自己能接受过去、现在和未来的异象。",
	"A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren't always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.": "被激发了洞察力的塞万被鼓励去磨练它，这样他们就有可能在他们的村子里担任预言家的角色。然而，这些努力并不总是成功的。洞察力有时会在雪人的一生中只出现一次，无论如何训练都无法再次瞥见这种幻觉。这被认为是最好的结果，因为塞万承认，那些真正有视力的人携带的知识既是一种祝福也是一种诅咒。",

	"When you cast this spell you may designate any number of creatures you can see to be concealed by the supernatural shadows while in the sphere. A concealed creature has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks when inside the sphere and may attempt to hide at any time. Because the area of the spell is lightly obscured, creatures within the spell's area have disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to see those outside of it.": "当你施展这个法术时，你可以指定任何数量的你能看到的生物在球体中被超自然的阴影所掩盖。被隐藏的生物在球体内时，在灵巧（（%0%））检查上有优势，并且可以在任何时候尝试隐藏。由于该法术的区域被轻度遮蔽，在该法术区域内的生物在智慧（{@skill Perception}）的检查上有劣势，无法看到其外的生物。",
	"All other creatures in the area are dazzled by the light of the miniature stars, causing them to have disadvantage on all perception checks inside the sphere. When such a creature enters the spell's area for the first time, or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its turn.": "该区域内的所有其他生物都会被微型恒星的光芒所眩晕，导致它们在球体内的所有感知检查中处于劣势。当这样的生物第一次进入法术区域，或者在那里开始它的回合，它必须做一个智慧救赎动作，否则会被（%0%），直到它的回合结束。",
	"You spread your arms wide, allowing yourself to become enveloped by the air around you. Until the end of your next turn, any ranged attack against you is made with disadvantage.": "你张开双臂，让自己被你周围的空气所笼罩。直到你的下一个回合结束，任何针对你的远程攻击都是以劣势进行的。",
	"Melee attackers who successfully hit you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker is flung away from you up to 10 feet and is knocked {@condition prone}.": "成功击中你的近战攻击者必须对你的法术救赎DC做一个宪法救赎。如果失败，攻击者会被甩出10英尺远，并被击倒（%0%）。",
	"You call upon the power of an Amaranthine to grant yourself insight into the Great Rhythm that moves all things. When you cast this spell, roll two {@dice d20}s, and record what you rolled. For each die, choose either attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. You can choose each option multiple times. For the next 24 hours, you may substitute any roll of an ally or enemy you can see within 60 feet with one of the recorded numbers that matches the type of roll you wish to replace (attack roll, skill check, or saving throw). The target still adds any relevant modifiers to this number, but otherwise treat the substituted number as the number they rolled.": "你召唤苋菜的力量，使你能洞察到推动万物的大节奏。当你施展这个法术时，掷出两个{@dice d20}的骰子，并记录你掷出的结果。对于每个骰子，你可以选择攻击卷、技能检查或救赎。你可以多次选择每个选项。在接下来的24小时内，你可以用所记录的数字中的一个来替代60英尺内你能看到的盟友或敌人的任何掷骰子，而这个数字要与你想替代的掷骰子类型相匹配（攻击掷骰子、技能检查、或救赎）。目标仍然会在这个数字上加上任何相关的修饰，但除此之外，将被替换的数字视为他们掷出的数字。",
	"To do this, you must spend a reaction to present your holy symbol and invoke the name of the Amaranthine whose energies you called upon. You can do this anytime after the skill check, saving throw or attack has been rolled, but before the outcome of the event has been determined. The spell ends after 24 hours have passed, or when both dice have been expended.": "要做到这一点，你必须花费一个反应来展示你的神圣符号，并呼唤你所召唤的能量的阿玛兰蒂恩的名字。你可以在技能检查、蓄力或攻击被掷出后，但在事件的结果被确定之前，随时做这个动作。咒语在24小时后结束，或在两个骰子都用完后结束。",
	"You call upon gentle natural magics to alter the growth of plants. Any plant life you can see within range that fits within a 5-foot cube can take on whatever shape you desire. Additionally, if the plant is a bramble or capable of growing thorns, you may turn the affected area into difficult terrain, causing {@dice 2d4} points of piercing damage for every 5 feet moved through the area you shaped. You may also increase or decrease the number of flowers, vines, leaves, thorns, branches, or fruits produced by any plant you shape.": "你召唤温和的自然魔法来改变植物的生长。你在范围内看到的任何符合5英尺立方体的植物生命都可以变成你想要的形状。此外，如果植物是荆棘或能长出荆棘，你可以将受影响的区域变成困难的地形，在你塑造的区域内每移动5英尺就会造成（%0%）点刺伤。你也可以增加或减少你塑造的任何植物所产生的花、藤、叶、刺、枝或果实的数量。",
	"After one hour, the magic of your spell fades, and the plant resumes its normal shape. If you can use speak with plants (or a similar ability) to communicate with the plant, you may persuade it to retain its new form. Different plants have different feelings and attitudes, and if the form is too different from its natural shape it is likely to decline. If the plant accepts, at the GM's discretion, it will retain the form you have sculpted it into, in which case the effect becomes permanent.": "一小时后，你的咒语的魔力就会消失，植物就会恢复正常形状。如果你能使用与植物对话（或类似的能力）与植物沟通，你可以说服它保留新的形态。不同的植物有不同的感觉和态度，如果形态与它的自然形态差别太大，它很可能会拒绝。如果植物接受，由GM决定，它将保留你所雕刻的形态，在这种情况下，效果将成为永久性的。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 4th level, the size of the cube of plant life you can affect with the spell increases by an additional 5 feet for every slot level above 4th.": "当你使用4级以上的法术槽施展此法术时，你能用此法术影响的植物生命立方体的大小，每超过4级的法术槽等级就会额外增加5英尺。",
	"An ethereal barrier of spikes, made of magical force, interposes itself between you and an attacker. Until your next turn, when you are hit by a melee attack, the barrier reduces the damage your are dealt by {@dice 2d4}, and deals the same amount of piercing damage to the attacker. The shield is ineffective against ranged attackers, but still provides a +2 bonus to AC (treat as half cover) against them for the duration.": "一个由魔法力量构成的空灵的尖刺屏障，插在你和攻击者之间。直到你的下一个回合，当你被近战攻击击中时，该屏障会减少你受到的伤害（%0%），并对攻击者造成相同数量的穿刺伤害。盾牌对远程攻击者无效，但在持续时间内仍能对他们提供+2的攻击力加成（视作一半的掩护）。",

	"You create two small stars that orbit you. They twinkle pleasantly, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius centered on you. The stars protect you. If a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack they must make a Wisdom saving throw or take {@dice 1d8} points of radiant damage for each star orbiting you.": "你创造了两颗围绕你的小星星。它们愉快地闪烁着，在以你为中心的10英尺范围内发出昏暗的光。这些星星保护你。如果一个在你5英尺范围内的生物用近身攻击击中你，他们必须做一个智慧救赎动作，否则在你周围的每颗星星都会受到{@dice 1d8}点辐射伤害。",
	"Once per round, on your turn, you may use your action to cause a star to streak towards an enemy, expending it as it explodes in a blinding flash. Make a ranged spell attack against an enemy within 120 feet, dealing {@damage 4d8} points of radiant damage on a hit. The target must then make a Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the start of your next turn.": "每回合一次，在你的回合中，你可以用你的行动使一颗星向敌人飞去，当它在刺眼的闪光中爆炸时消耗它。对120英尺范围内的敌人进行远程法术攻击，击中后造成{@damage 4d8}点辐射伤害。然后，目标必须进行宪法救赎，否则就会受到{@condition blinded}的伤害，直到你下一个回合开始。",
	"The spell ends when either its duration expires, you fall {@condition unconscious}, or you have expended all of your stars.": "当咒语的持续时间结束，你倒下（%0%），或者你耗尽了你所有的星星，咒语就会结束。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 4th level, you may create one additional star for every two slot levels above 4th. For each additional star orbiting you, the radius of dim light centered on you increases by 5 feet.": "当你使用四级以上的法术槽施展这个法术时，你可以为四级以上的每两个法术槽等级创造一个额外的星星。每增加一颗围绕你的星星，以你为中心的昏暗光线的半径就增加5英尺。",

	"Ardea is depicted as a great stork with shining golden feathers, wreathed in flowers or other plant life. She is the Amaranthine of the sun who watches over the flora and fauna of Everden and provides them with light and energy to grow.": "阿狄亚被描绘成一只巨大的鹳，有着闪亮的金色羽毛，身上缠绕着鲜花或其他植物。她是太阳的Amaranthine，守护着埃弗顿的动植物，为它们的生长提供光和能量。",
	"Ardea's light is present in all living things, from the tiniest sprouting seed to the mightiest beast. Her light also represents love and kindness, which every creature is believed to possess. All birdfolk are said to be Ardea's children, and many think she appears as a stork to demonstrate her maternal love for them—although she is speculated to appear in a different form to each woodland race.": "阿迪尔的光存在于所有生物中，从最微小的萌芽种子到最强大的野兽。她的光也代表着爱和仁慈，每个生物都被认为拥有这些。所有的鸟人据说都是阿迪亚的孩子，许多人认为她以鹳鸟的形象出现，以显示她对他们的母爱--尽管据推测，她以不同的形式出现在每个林地种族。",
	"When she vacates the sky she rests in a plane of pure light and life. There, great celestial storks carry out her will, and act as her messengers in the mortal world. An old folk story relates that Ardea sends these storks to fly unnoticed into Everden, where they place her animating light into unhatched eggs. This is why birdfolk often refer to her as \"Mother Stork\".": "当她离开天空时，她在一个纯粹的光和生命的平面上休息。在那里，伟大的天体鹳鸟执行她的意志，并作为她在凡人世界的信使。一个古老的民间故事说，阿迪雅派这些鹳鸟神不知鬼不觉地飞到埃弗登，在那里它们把她的灵光放入未孵化的蛋中。这就是为什么鸟人经常称她为 \"鹳妈妈\"。",
	"She is worshiped by good aligned characters of every sort: poets write of the love she has bestowed upon the world, priests ask her to watch over the newly born, and farmers pray to her for good harvests and light winters.": "她被各种善良的结盟人物所崇拜：诗人写下了她赐予世界的爱，牧师要求她看护新生儿，农民向她祈求丰收和轻盈的冬天。",
	"Tyton is depicted as an immense black barn owl. It is believed he ushers the night in by spreading his wings over the sky. Tyton also governs time, memory, and death. As the sun must set, so too must the light of life give way to the darkness of the grave. Rather than being seen as a frightful figure, Tyton is looked upon as kind; he greets the old, the frail, and those at the end of their lives as familiar friends, guiding their souls peacefully back into the Great Rhythm, where they will be reborn, in time.": "泰顿被描绘成一只巨大的黑色仓鸮。人们相信他通过在天空中张开翅膀来迎接夜晚的到来。泰顿还掌管着时间、记忆和死亡。由于太阳必须落下，生命之光也必须让位于坟墓的黑暗。泰坦没有被看作是一个可怕的人物，而是被看作是一个善良的人；他像熟悉的朋友一样迎接年老、虚弱和生命尽头的人，引导他们的灵魂平静地回到大节奏中，在那里他们将获得重生，在时间上。",
	"When not occupying the sky, it is believed Tyton resides in the lands of death. Not an afterlife, rather this is a part of the Great Rhythm where everything is cold, dark, and eternally still. His abode lies beyond the parts of the Rhythm associated with life, a divide impossible for mortals to cross. Even other Amaranthine find travel to the lands of death difficult, except for Altus, who resides there with Tyton for most of the year, only leaving to bring winter storms across the land.": "在不占据天空的时候，人们相信泰坦居住在死亡之地。这不是一个来世，而是大节奏的一部分，在那里一切都很冷，很黑暗，而且永远静止。他的住处位于节奏中与生命有关的部分之外，是一个凡人无法跨越的鸿沟。即使是其他亚马逊人也发现前往死亡之地很困难，除了阿尔图斯，他一年中的大部分时间都和泰坦一起居住在那里，只有在冬季暴风雨来临的时候才会离开。",
	"In addition to guiding the souls of the dead, Tyton is associated with the coming of old age, and the keeping of memory. When Tyton is invoked at funerals, it is to remember those who have passed, and to recall their lives and deeds. He watches the living, patiently observing all beneath him. Tyton can learn all there is to know of your life by watching your dreams. Because Tyton watches the living from birth to death, he is known as \"Father Owl\".": "除了引导死者的灵魂，Tyton还与老年的到来和记忆的保持有关。当泰坦在葬礼上被召唤时，是为了纪念那些已经去世的人，并回忆他们的生活和事迹。他注视着活人，耐心地观察着他身下的一切。泰顿可以通过观察你的梦境来了解你生活中的一切。因为泰坦从出生到死亡都在观察生者，他被称为 \"猫头鹰之父\"。",
	"Tyton frowns upon those who would seek to enslave the souls of the dead using necromantic magics, and those who would desecrate the tombs of the deceased, as these actions corrupt the natural cycle.": "泰顿对那些试图用亡灵魔法奴役死者灵魂的人，以及那些亵渎死者坟墓的人不屑一顾，因为这些行为会破坏自然循环。",
	"Altus is depicted as a powerful horned owl with white feathers, who rides across the sky pouring thunderheads from his chalice. Altus is a pragmatic Amaranthine, believing that strength is cultivated through enduring hardships, overcoming challenges, and testing mortal limitations. Stories of Altus' tenacity and endurance abound, including the time he captured the moon as a gift to Ardea, and the time he made the mountains by lifting the earth. Themes of bravery and strength are common in his myths.": "阿尔图斯被描绘成一只长着白色羽毛的强大角鸮，他骑在天空中，从他的圣杯中倾泻出雷电。阿尔图斯是一个务实的亚马逊人，认为力量是通过忍受困难、克服挑战和测试凡人的限制来培养的。关于阿尔图斯的坚韧和耐力的故事比比皆是，包括他抓住月亮作为礼物送给阿迪亚，以及他通过抬起地球来创造山脉的时间。勇敢和力量的主题在他的神话中很常见。",
	"Altus resides with Tyton in the lands of death. Legend says that every year Altus makes the long and arduous journey to bring winter storms and foul weather. According to myth, this is as much to test the endurance of his people as it is to test himself by crossing the divide between life and death, which binds the Great Rhythm. Summers with especially bad weather are credited to Altus, who made the trip early to keep his people strong and vigilant.": "阿尔图斯与泰顿一起居住在死亡之境中。传说中，阿尔图斯每年都会进行漫长而艰辛的旅行，带来冬季的风暴和恶劣的天气。根据神话，这既是为了测试他的人民的耐力，也是为了通过跨越生与死之间的分界线来测试他自己，而这一分界线将大律动捆绑在一起。气候特别恶劣的夏天归功于阿尔图斯，他早早地进行了旅行，以保持他的人民的强大和警惕性。",
	"Altus is the patron Amaranthine of the strig, and is celebrated by them annually in a great winter festival. Games and activities during this festival challenge entrants with feats of strength and endurance. No official winner is declared, and all who participate are lauded for their courage and given a special place at the feasting table.": "阿尔图斯是斯特里格人的守护神，他们每年都会在一个伟大的冬季节日中庆祝。在这个节日里，各种游戏和活动都是对参赛者力量和耐力的挑战。没有宣布正式的赢家，所有参与的人都因其勇气而受到赞扬，并在宴会上获得一个特殊的位置。",
	"Altus usually finds veneration among warriors or athletes, but also among common people who pray for strength to withstand personal hardships, bad harvests, and natural disasters.": "阿尔图斯通常在战士或运动员中得到崇敬，但也在普通人中得到崇敬，他们祈祷有力量抵御个人困难、歉收和自然灾害。",
	"Fickle and unpredictable, Clhuran is the Amaranthine of fortune, magic, and fate. He is commonly represented in dual profile: on one side as a jester with bangles and bells, carrying a marotte, and on the other as an executioner, weilding an axe. Clhuran's double profile illustrates his fickle nature, and the nature of fate. Clhuran's tales are of his luck, mirth, and jest, though he is also known to be a capricious Amaranthine. His normally pleasant demeanor can shift at a moment's notice to melancholy or jealousy.": "克赫兰是幸运、魔法和命运的代表，善变且不可预测。他通常以双重形象出现：一边是戴着手镯和铃铛、拿着马洛特的小丑，另一边是拿着斧头的刽子手。克赫兰的双重形象说明了他善变的本性，以及命运的本质。克赫兰的故事是关于他的运气、欢笑和玩笑的，尽管他也被称为是一个任性的阿马兰斯人。他通常愉快的举止可以在一瞬间转变为忧郁或嫉妒。",
	"Clhuran teaches that everyone is tied to the web of fate by invisible strands. Each thread extends out into the cosmos, darting and weaving as it moves to the Rhythm. Clhuran's wisdom is to allow yourself to be moved by the threads of fate, to feel the pull of possibility around you, and to act in accordance with their whims. Even misfortune may lead one to an important place, or so Clhuran says. Good times and bad times are all part of the tapestry of fate, and there is a strength that can be drawn from accepting one's destiny. According to his teachings, good luck is nothing more than being open to change, and following the will of the universe.": "克赫兰教导说，每个人都被无形的线束缚在命运之网上。每条线都延伸到宇宙中，随着节奏的变化而跳动和编织。克赫兰的智慧是让自己被命运之线所感动，感受周围可能性的牵引，并按照它们的想法行事。即使是不幸，也可能将一个人带到一个重要的地方，或者说克赫兰是这么说的。好时光和坏时光都是命运织锦的一部分，有一种力量可以从接受一个人的命运中汲取。根据他的教义，好运不过是对变化持开放态度，并遵循宇宙的意志。",
	"Lumas are seen to be Clhuran's chosen, because of their connection to the threads of fate, which manifests as a natural magical talent. Arcane spellcasters, seers, and fortune tellers pray to Clhuran for insight into the will of the universe. Bards, artists, and writers also pay homage to Clhuran, because of his wild moods and connection to emotion. They hope to follow their fate to events of great import, which may be immortalized by their art.": "卢马人被认为是克赫兰选中的人，因为他们与命运之线有联系，这表现为一种自然的魔法天赋。奥术师、预言家和算命先生向克莱胡兰祈祷，希望能洞察宇宙的意志。吟游诗人、艺术家和作家也向克赫兰致敬，因为他有狂野的情绪和与情感的联系。他们希望能跟随自己的命运进入具有重大意义的事件，这些事件可能会被他们的艺术所永存。",

She acknowledges that delving into the unknown requires the courage to be burned.": "Gesme是一个神秘的人物，她是掌管知识、洞察力和灵感的Amaranthine。她代表火，是激发和毁灭的火花。她承认，对未知事物的探索需要有被燃烧的勇气。",
	"Gesme is depicted as a raven, whose body is alight with the flames of knowledge. In her talons she carries a staff of burning oak which lights the way for scholars. Gesme is best known for stealing fire from Ardea's sun and bringing it to Everden, burning her feathers black in the process.": "Gesme被描绘成一只乌鸦，其身体被知识的火焰点燃。她的爪子里拿着一根燃烧的橡木杖，为学者们照亮道路。格斯梅最出名的是她从阿迪亚的太阳上偷了火，并把它带到了埃弗登，在这个过程中她的羽毛被烧成黑色。",
	"Her stolen flame brought fire and the light of reason to the world. While this act earned her a place among the Amaranthine, many feel it was a folly to give fire to mortals.": "她偷来的火焰给世界带来了火和理性之光。虽然这一行为为她赢得了在亚马逊人中的地位，但许多人认为把火种给凡人是一种愚蠢的行为。",
	"She is the patron spirit of the corvums. Legend has it that all corvums have at least one black feather, symbolic of Gesme's seared plumage.": "她是科沃姆族的守护神。传说中，所有的珊瑚虫都至少有一根黑色的羽毛，象征着Gesme的血色羽翼。",
	"Gesme teaches that chaos and innovation are part of a great cycle. Each discovery spawns a new mystery, which leads to further discovery in a never-ending loop, in which the old becomes fodder for the new. She is a symbol of all that birdfolk can achieve if they dare to push boundaries and harness their creativity.": "Gesme教导我们，混乱和创新是一个大循环的一部分。每一个发现都会产生一个新的谜团，而新的谜团又会导致进一步的发现，这是一个永无止境的循环，旧的东西会成为新的东西的素材。她是一个象征，象征着鸟人如果敢于突破界限，发挥自己的创造力所能取得的一切。",
	"First among her followers are those who study the arcane arts or experiment with magical forces, such as scholars and mages. She is also revered by artisans, and craftspeople of every kind. Blacksmiths in particular understand the danger and power of working directly with flames and pay her special reverence. Her followers pray to her for the spark of creativity that will ignite the fires of creation.": "在她的追随者中，首先是那些研究奥秘艺术或试验魔法力量的人，如学者和法师。她也受到工匠和各种手艺人的敬重。铁匠们尤其了解直接与火焰打交道的危险和力量，因此对她特别崇敬。她的追随者们向她祈祷，希望能有创意的火花，点燃创造的火焰。",
	"Hanera is the birdfolk Amaranthine closest to nature. She holds dominion over all things that grow within the earth. While Ardea is the animating force of life, Hanera is the guiding heart that gives life purpose and meaning. She encourages birdfolk to see the world not only from the treetops, but from the loam and all the tiny living things beneath. Everything, Hanera teaches, is connected as part of a vast continuum of life stretching back to the earliest ancestors.": "哈内拉是最接近自然的鸟人阿玛兰蒂恩。她主宰着生长在地球上的所有事物。阿迪雅是生命的活力，而哈内拉则是赋予生命目的和意义的引导者。她鼓励鸟人不仅要从树顶上看世界，还要从泥土和下面所有微小的生物中看世界。哈内拉教导说，所有的东西都是相互联系的，是延伸到最早的祖先的巨大生命连续体的一部分。",

	"Her generosity and kindness are renowned, as is her intolerance for evil. It is Hanera's will that evil be challenged wherever it is found. Not with violence, but with acts of compassion. Those who harbor darkness in their hearts require the warmth of friends, family, and shelter to heal, and so Hanera teaches birdfolk never to give up on each other. Even the most wicked among us can be healed with love.": "她的慷慨和善良是著名的，她对邪恶的不容忍也是如此。哈内拉的意愿是，无论在哪里发现邪恶，都要对其进行挑战。不是用暴力，而是用怜悯的行为。那些心中藏有黑暗的人需要朋友、家庭和庇护所的温暖来治愈，因此哈内拉教导鸟人永远不要放弃彼此。即使是我们中最邪恶的人也可以用爱来治愈。",
	"Hanera is worshiped by farmers and druids, but many clerics tend shrines in her honor, mostly in modest woodland villages. Her holy symbol is often hung above the doorway, inside a home, to bless the dwelling and all those within.": "哈内拉受到农民和德鲁伊的崇拜，但许多神职人员也为她建造神龛，大多是在温和的林地村庄。她的神圣标志经常挂在家门口，以保佑住宅和里面的所有人。",

She is the patron of the raptors, and is believed to have endowed them with their superior senses.": "雷亚，风之女神，被描绘成一只大鹰，裹着旋转的云朵的斗篷，爪子里挥舞着一把大长弓。她是猛禽的守护神，并被认为赋予了它们超强的感官。",
	"The wind is free, streaming unimpeded across land and sea. Reya embodies this freedom. Her spirit glides through trees, over mountains, and out to the four corners of the world. She is the Amaranthine of exploration; her holy symbol forms a compass. Free-spirited folk who feel an insatiable urge to wander and roam the lands have been touched by her winds.": "风是自由的，不受阻碍地穿过陆地和海洋。雷亚体现了这种自由。她的精神穿过树木，越过山脉，向世界的四个角落滑行。她是探索的阿马兰蒂恩；她的神圣符号形成了一个指南针。自由奔放的人们感到有一种永不满足的冲动，想去流浪和漫游土地，他们被她的风所触动。",
	"Reya is a skilled hunter, credited with the invention of the bow, a gift she passed down to the birdfolk. She is also honored for her skills in navigating wild country and surviving off the land. Travelers undertaking long journeys pray to be blessed by a portion of her talents, to assist them in the perilous wilderness. Reya watches over those who embark on daring expeditions, protecting travelers and presenting them with challenges to make their journey all the more memorable.": "雷亚是一个熟练的猎人，被认为是弓的发明者，她把这一天赋传给了鸟人。她还因其在野外航行和在土地上生存的技能而受到尊敬。进行长途旅行的旅行者祈求得到她的一部分才能的祝福，以帮助他们在危险的荒野中生存。雷亚注视着那些开始大胆探险的人，保护旅行者并向他们提出挑战，使他们的旅程更加难忘。",

	"An Amaranthine of vigor and strength, Cairith is the patron spirit of the cervans. The energy that Cairith oversees is the cause of slow, steady growth and longevity. In living beings, this force manifests as the ability to run, jump, grow, and become strong. Ancient forests, where plants cover the trees and giant beasts are endowed with the intelligence to speak, are seen as signs of Cairith's blessing. Cairith teaches that adversity brings strength, but his teachings differ from those of Altus. Altus encourages his followers to seek out challenges, where Cairith sees life itself as a perpetual struggle. The true test of survival is always against oneself and one's own limits. By persevering in spite of these limits, Cairith counsels his adherents to triumph over the forces of death. This struggle must one day end, of course, and so the followers of Cairith seek to honor the daily triumphs of life as they happen. An existence is considered well-spent if it was lived unflinchingly, even in the face of sorrows and hardships. Cairith adamantly opposes necromancy as those made undead truly cannot appreciate life's struggles.": "凯里斯是充满活力和力量的苋菜，是塞万族的守护神。凯里斯所监督的能量是缓慢、稳定的增长和长寿的原因。在生物体内，这种力量表现为奔跑、跳跃、成长和变得强壮的能力。古老的森林里，植物覆盖着树木，巨大的野兽被赋予了说话的智慧，这些都被看作是凯里斯祝福的标志。凯里斯教导人们，逆境会带来力量，但他的教导与阿尔图斯的教导不同。阿尔图斯鼓励他的追随者寻求挑战，而凯里斯则认为生活本身就是一场持久的斗争。对生存的真正考验总是针对自己和自己的极限。尽管有这些限制，但通过坚持不懈的努力，凯里斯劝告他的信徒们战胜死亡的力量。当然，这场斗争总有一天会结束，因此凯里斯的追随者们寻求尊重每天发生的生命胜利。如果一个人坚定不移地活着，甚至面对悲伤和困难，那么他的存在就被认为是美好的。凯里斯坚决反对亡灵巫术，因为那些被制成亡灵的人确实无法欣赏生命的挣扎。",
	"Cairith is described as a mighty stag with antlers covered in moss and flowering vines. He is massively tall, and wherever he walks plants sprout from the earth. Where others see a tangle of vegetation, Cairith sees the plan of nature unfolding. All cervans profess a kinship to Cairith. But rather than claiming him as a direct ancestor, he is seen as a guardian spirit. Some say he was the first to be born from the land when the Dawnmother gave Everden life.": "凯里斯被描述为一只强大的雄鹿，鹿角上长满了苔藓和花藤。他身材高大，无论他走到哪里，植物都会从地里冒出来。别人看到的是纠结的植被，而凯里斯看到的是大自然的计划正在展开。所有塞万人都声称与凯里斯有亲属关系。但与其说他是直接的祖先，不如说他被看作是一个守护神。有人说他是曙光之母赋予埃弗顿生命时，第一个从土地上诞生的人。",
	"Cairith guided the first cervans, and blessed them with many gifts so that they might survive in the primitive forest. One of these gifts, the power of The Sight, is attributed to Cairith. Certain cervans are gifted with The Sight, and this allows them to glimpse events that have occurred in the past, present, and future.": "凯里斯引导着第一批雪人，并以许多礼物赐予他们，使他们能够在原始森林中生存。其中一种天赋，即 \"视力 \"的力量，归功于凯里斯。某些塞万人被赋予了 \"视力\"，这使他们能够瞥见过去、现在和未来发生的事件。",
	"Cairith finds reverence among rangers, druids, healers, and community leaders. Paladins invoke his dogma to give heart to those they defend. Cervan diviners gifted with the Sight call upon Cairith in their rituals. Cairith also has many followers among common people, especially humblefolk who have suffered hardships.": "凯里斯在游侠、德鲁伊、治疗师和社区领袖中受到敬重。圣骑士们援引他的教条来为他们所捍卫的人提供心。有视力天赋的塞万族占卜师在他们的仪式中召唤凯里斯。凯里斯在普通人中也有很多追随者，特别是那些遭受过苦难的卑微的人。",
	"An Amaranthine of heroism and valor, Gaspard is \"The Champion\". In life, Gaspard was a great jerbeen leader. Upon his death, the Great Rhythm took him, and his spirit ascended as an Amaranthine. It is believed he was chosen to serve as an example of greatness, one to inspire others for generations to come. Tales of his mortal adventures have earned him renown. He traveled the whole of Everden, with his closest companions, slaying monsters, unseating tyrants, and bringing peace and prosperity wherever he roamed.": "加斯帕德是一个具有英雄主义和英勇精神的阿马兰斯人，是 \"冠军\"。在生活中，加斯帕德是一位伟大的杰比恩领袖。在他死后，伟大的节奏带走了他，他的灵魂作为阿玛兰斯人升华了。人们相信，他被选为伟大的榜样，激励着一代又一代的人。他在凡间的冒险故事为他赢得了声誉。他和他最亲密的伙伴们走遍了整个埃弗顿，杀死了怪物，推翻了暴君，并在他游荡的地方带来和平与繁荣。",
	"Gaspard's followers believe the actions of an individual ripple outwards, affecting those around us, which in turn can embolden anyone to achieve greatness. The example of Gaspard teaches jerbeen to affect others with acts of courage, heroism, and kindness.": "加斯帕德的追随者认为，个人的行为会向外荡漾，影响我们周围的人，这反过来又能使任何人有勇气实现伟大。加斯帕德的例子教导杰比恩用勇气、英雄主义和仁慈的行为影响他人。",
	"At times, Gaspard has been at odds with other Amaranthine. Before he ascended, there is a tale of him meeting Kren, where he was forced to show no sign of fear, lest she eat him and his companions. Thankfully, his composure kept his group strong, and in turn their bravery kept him strong. They escaped with their lives.": "有时，加斯帕德会与其他阿玛兰丁人发生冲突。在他升天之前，有一个关于他遇到克伦的故事，在那里他被迫不表现出恐惧，以免她吃掉他和他的同伴们。值得庆幸的是，他的镇定使他的团队保持坚强，反过来，他们的勇敢也使他保持坚强。他们逃过了一劫。",
	"Gaspard's example has lead many to heed the paladin's call. Gaspard is worshiped by warriors who seek to match his exploits, as well as bards who seek to inspire others through the telling of heroic tales.": "加斯帕德的榜样使许多人听从了圣骑士的召唤。加斯帕德被那些试图与他的功绩相媲美的战士们所崇拜，也被那些试图通过讲述英雄故事来激励他人的吟游诗人所崇拜。",
	"Humblefolk hold summer festivals in his honor. These holidays include storytelling, puppet shows, and magnificent jousts where armored jerbeens mounted on tamed wolves put on a spectacle of courage and daring before the crowds.": "谦卑的人们为了纪念他而举行夏季的节日。这些节日包括讲故事、木偶戏和华丽的比武，在比武中，骑在被驯服的狼身上的铠甲骑士在众人面前上演勇气和胆量的奇观。",
	"Known as \"The Uncaring\", \"The All-Knowing Stars\", and \"The Whisperer\", Hath is an Amaranthine that humblefolk and birdfolk alike struggle to understand. In spite of this conflict, Hath is revered by the mapach. According to them, Hath was a constellation of stars who listened carefully to the Nightfather. In ancient times, the Nightfather spoke and spread his vast wisdom across the primordial darkness. He spoke of night, of time, and of the worlds beyond life. The constellation listened and grew wise, too wise to remain as stars. Thus, it became a part of the Great Rhythm as the Amaranthine of fear, doubt, and secrets. This is why, the tellers say, the Nightfather no longer speaks.": "哈斯被称为 \"无情的人\"、\"全知的星 \"和 \"低语者\"，他是一个卑微的人和鸟人都难以理解的亚马逊人。尽管有这种冲突，哈斯还是受到了马帕奇人的敬重。根据他们的说法，哈斯是一个仔细聆听夜神的星星星座。在远古时代，夜父在原始的黑暗中说话并传播他巨大的智慧。他谈到了黑夜，谈到了时间，谈到了生命以外的世界。星座听了之后变得聪明起来，聪明得不能再聪明，就像星星一样。因此，它成为大节奏的一部分，成为恐惧、怀疑和秘密的苋菜。这就是为什么，讲述者说，夜神不再说话了。",
	"Ever since, Hath has whispered its unsettling secrets to the creatures below, speaking quietly so the other stars cannot hear. Mapachs were not the first to hear its voice, but they claim to be the first to truly make use of its secrets. While priests of Hath do not necessarily \"hear\" the words of the stars, mapachs believe that Hath speaks in subtle ways. Those frightened while traveling at night or caught in dangerous situations are bestowed with cautious and crafty thoughts by Hath. If heeded, one may survive. If ignored, one may die. Either way, Hath, The Uncaring, is apathetic.": "从那时起，哈斯就向下面的生物低声诉说它那令人不安的秘密，悄悄地说话，让其他星星听不到。马帕奇人不是第一个听到它声音的人，但他们声称是第一个真正利用它的秘密的人。虽然哈斯的祭司不一定能 \"听到 \"星星的话，但马帕奇人相信哈斯会以微妙的方式说话。那些在夜间旅行时受到惊吓或陷入危险境地的人，会被Hath赋予谨慎和狡猾的想法。如果听从了，就可能活下来。如果被忽视，则可能死亡。无论是哪种方式，无情的哈斯都是冷漠的。",
	"The stars teach the importance of trusting in oneself and keeping your wits about you, even in dire situations. When a mapach gets a shiver of premonition, something they could never have known, it is said to be the whispers of Hath they have heard.": "星星教导人们相信自己和保持智慧的重要性，即使在恶劣的情况下。当一个mapach得到一个颤抖的预感，一些他们不可能知道的事情，据说是他们听到了哈斯的低语。",
	"Hath has few followers, and most are mapachs. Rangers and travelers passing through dangerous parts of the Wood at night often pay homage to the All-Knowing Stars. While some pray to this Amaranthine for guidance, others hope not to hear Hath's voice, as the stars only whisper to those in peril. Warlocks make pacts with this Amaranthine for knowledge of the worlds beyond life. Most consider this practice to be rather reckless—The Uncaring is known to exact a terrible price for such secrets. Some lose their mind delving into the vast reservoir of knowledge that Hath is all too eager to supply.": "哈斯的追随者不多，大多数是马帕奇人。夜间经过森林危险地区的游侠和旅行者经常向全知的星星致敬。有些人向这位阿玛兰蒂恩祈求指引，有些人则希望不要听到哈斯的声音，因为星星只对处于危险中的人说悄悄话。术士们为了获得生命以外的世界的知识而与这个阿玛兰蒂恩签订契约。大多数人认为这种做法是相当鲁莽的--众所周知，无畏者会为这种秘密付出可怕的代价。有些人在钻研哈斯急于提供的巨大知识库时，会失去理智。",
	"Henwin, the patron spirit of hedges, is venerated by humblefolk of all kinds. They are the Amaranthine of balance, and teach that all things in the forest must be respected, as all are connected in a great web of kindness. It is thanks to the sun that the plants grow, and because the plants grow, all living things have food. Decayed food turns into soil, which nourishes more life. The teachings of Henwin ask followers to take into consideration the many kindnesses which brought each of them into being and nourished them throughout their lives.": "亨文是树篱的守护神，受到各种谦卑的人们的敬仰。他们是平衡的苋菜，教导人们必须尊重森林中的所有事物，因为所有事物都在一个巨大的仁慈之网中相连。正是因为有了太阳，植物才得以生长，而由于植物的生长，所有生物都有了食物。腐烂的食物变成了土壤，滋养了更多的生命。亨文的教义要求追随者考虑到使他们每个人产生并滋养他们一生的许多仁慈。",
	"It is only fitting, then, that Henwin is said to be a hedgehog who spends their life in the forest. Storytellers say that they reside in an ancient part of the world, hidden from the eyes of most mortals, where they inhabit a tangle of roots from every forest that has ever grown. Here they tend to a garden of moss, fungi, and insects, helping to keep the living roots healthy. Henwin ensures that even the husks of withered plants can provide for the vegetation and creatures who rely on dead things for sustenance.": "因此，据说Henwin是一只在森林中度过一生的刺猬，这是非常合适的。讲故事的人说，他们居住在世界的一个古老的地方，隐藏在大多数凡人的视线之外，在那里他们居住在一个由每一个曾经生长过的森林的根系组成的纠缠中。在这里，他们照料着一个由苔藓、真菌和昆虫组成的花园，帮助保持活根的健康。亨文确保即使是枯萎植物的外壳也能为植物和依靠死物维持生计的生物提供食物。",
	"Unlike other Amaranthine, Henwin is not described as male or female. Being a spirit of balance, they are considered to possess traits of all genders. They are often depicted carrying a yellow rose, which is their symbol. When a yellow rose blooms, it is said to be Henwin, blessing a forest with the beauty of their quiet grace. These roses are often given as tokens of friendship.": "与其他阿马兰特人不同，Henwin不被描述为男性或女性。作为一种平衡的精神，他们被认为拥有所有性别的特征。他们经常被描绘成携带一朵黄玫瑰，这是他们的象征。当一朵黄玫瑰绽放时，据说是Henwin，用他们安静的优雅之美来祝福森林。这些玫瑰常常作为友谊的信物被赠送。",
	"Henwin teaches understanding, and respect for the web of kindness that connects all life. If death is dealt indiscriminately, the web may become damaged. Although it is resilient, the web is still as fragile as one made from spider's silk. It is the duty of all who follow Henwin to strengthen the web and to help maintain the balance which supports all living things.": "亨文教导人们理解和尊重连接所有生命的仁慈之网。如果不分青红皂白地对待死亡，这张网可能会被破坏。虽然它有弹性，但这张网仍然像蜘蛛丝做的一样脆弱。所有追随Henwin的人都有责任加强这张网，帮助维持支持所有生物的平衡。",
	"Henwin is followed by druids, who take the message of nature's web of kindness to heart. Henwin's druids can be found protecting groves and leading communities, keeping both safe from those with harmful intentions. Priests of Henwin often invoke the Amaranthine Henwin's name to protect the fauna, flora, and folk under their care. Gardeners honor Henwin by keeping plots filled with a diverse array of complementary plant and insect life.": "亨文有德鲁伊跟随，他们将自然界的仁慈之网的信息铭记于心。亨文的德鲁伊可以被发现保护丛林和领导社区，使两者不受那些有害的意图的影响。亨文的祭司们经常引用阿马兰蒂恩-亨文的名字来保护他们所照顾的动物、植物和民众。园丁们通过在地块上种满各种互补的植物和昆虫来纪念亨文。",
	"The Amaranthine of predation and guile, Kren is portrayed as a great fox-like beast, whose form is usually obscured by shadows. The only known parts of her form are her fangs and her eyes, glinting as they catch the light. Kren appears in many tales, as often a villain as a hero, and even then it is rare that her motives are laudable. Yet, one can learn from Kren, for her stories often demonstrate how hubris can be exploited, how heroes can be laid low, and how there is no weapon so deadly as flattery.": "克伦是捕食和狡诈的阿玛兰丁，被描绘成一只巨大的狐狸般的野兽，其形态通常被阴影所掩盖。她的外形唯一已知的部分是她的獠牙和她的眼睛，当它们捕捉到光线时闪闪发光。克伦出现在许多故事中，既是反派又是英雄，即使如此，她的动机也很少是值得称赞的。然而，人们可以从克伦身上学到东西，因为她的故事常常表明傲慢如何被利用，英雄如何被压制，以及没有比奉承更致命的武器。",
	"The patron spirit of the vulpin, Kren teaches them to walk the line between savagery and sophistication, and how and when each should be used. For many other humblefolk she demonstrates the value of cunning, showing that no creature is so wise or mighty that they cannot be taken advantage of.": "作为庸人的守护神，克伦教导他们如何在野蛮和老练之间行走，以及如何和何时应该使用每一种手段。对于许多其他卑微的人来说，她展示了狡猾的价值，表明没有任何生物是如此聪明或强大，以至于他们不能被利用的。",
	"Stories of her origin are often vague and contradictory. A popular vulpin myth tells that Kren came from a time before life existed on Everden. That she was an ancient force, ready to feast on a world full of new and fresh meat, who simply awoke when the Dawnmother and Nightfather set creation in motion. Others believe she was the first vulpin, who ascended from an ordinary fox. As the story goes, Kren tricked the Dawnmother into allowing her to watch over the Amaranthine's two divine feathers. Kren ate a single feather and became the Amaranthine of guile. This is why the Dawnmother only carries one feather in her beak.": "关于她的起源的故事往往是模糊的和矛盾的。一个流行的庸俗神话说，克伦来自埃弗登星球上生命存在之前的时代。她是一种古老的力量，准备在这个充满新鲜肉体的世界上大快朵颐，当黎明之母和黑夜之父开始创造时，她就醒了。还有人认为她是第一只狐狸，从一只普通的狐狸升起。正如故事所言，克伦欺骗了曙光之母，让她看管阿玛兰蒂恩的两根神圣的羽毛。克伦吃了一根羽毛，成为狡猾的阿玛兰蒂恩。这就是为什么曙光之母的嘴里只带一根羽毛的原因。",
	"Kren isn't worshiped in the same way as other Amaranthine. Rather, Kren is invoked in stories to teach the dangers of vainglory. Many outlaws keep shrines to her patronage. These individuals include thieves, smugglers, and purveyors of black market goods. Priests of Kren use her stories to teach others how to be crafty and cunning, but also to be cautious of the wiles of others. There are those, however, who invoke Kren for dark rites and rituals to gain power for themselves. Kren is always ready to make bargains with such supplicants, but all who do are fated to be devoured by her when their lives finally come to an end.": "克伦并不像其他亚马逊人那样受到崇拜。相反，克伦在故事中被援引来教导虚荣心的危险。许多亡命之徒都有神龛供奉她。这些人包括盗贼、走私者和黑市商品的销售者。克伦的祭司们用她的故事教导他人如何狡猾，但也要谨慎对待他人的诡计。然而，也有一些人援引克伦进行黑暗的仪式和典礼，为自己获得权力。克伦总是准备与这些祈求者进行交易，但所有这样做的人在他们的生命最终结束时都注定要被她吞噬。",
	"This legendary artifact was created by a powerful wizard, crafted from the finger of a towering, ancient elemental aspect of frost. It is so cold to the touch that it numbs any skin it comes into contact with, although an attuned character is immune to this effect.": "这个传说中的神器是由一个强大的巫师创造的，由一个高大的、古老的冰霜元素的手指制作而成。它是如此的冰冷，以至于它接触到的任何皮肤都会被麻痹，尽管一个经过调整的角色对这种效果是免疫的。",

	"The helm itself is simple leather, hide, scale, or plate, but the magic imbued into it comes from the feather.

	"Nature, or the forest, might be quite the distance from our homes, Twitch streams, or stages where we play RPGs like {@i 5th Edition} (because oddly enough that's the magical world we live in now). We throw dice onto surfaces made of trees whose history we are woefully clueless of. Did the tree have a story, or a family of owls living in it, or a fox kit that sheltered a storm beneath its branches? We don't know these tales as we weave our own, but the connection is still there. We're still tromping through the wilderness and smelling the fresh air and fearing its dangers, even if it's in our imagination.": "大自然，或者说森林，可能离我们的家、Twitch流，或者我们玩RPG游戏的舞台（%0%）（因为奇怪的是，这就是我们现在生活的神奇世界）有相当的距离。我们把骰子扔到由树木制成的表面上，而这些树木的历史我们完全不知道。这棵树是否有一个故事，或住着一个猫头鹰家族，或在它的树枝下躲避风暴的狐狸伴侣？在我们编织自己的故事时，我们不知道这些故事，但这种联系仍然存在。我们仍然在荒野中跋涉，闻着新鲜空气，害怕它的危险，即使是在我们的想象中。",
	"Storytelling on its own has always been connected to nature. Legends of animals as gods or animals as human-like protagonists permeate all cultures. The Native American stories of the trickster Raven, the Medieval fable of the {@i Owl and the Nightingale}, or something as obvious and simple as {@i Grimm's Fairy Tales} are all examples of how the natural world around us has shaped storytelling. The magic of animals and their usually unseen lives intrigues us, sparks our imagination, and we see a lot of ourselves in them when we finally slow down enough to look. Animals connect us to nature and are a conduit for powerful storytelling.": "讲故事本身就一直与自然有关。关于动物为神或动物为人类主角的传说渗透到所有文化中。美国本土的乌鸦捣蛋的故事，中世纪的{@i Owl and the Nightingale}寓言，或者像{@i Grimm's Fairy Tales}这样明显而简单的东西，都是我们周围的自然世界如何塑造故事的例子。动物的魔力和它们通常不为人知的生活让我们感到好奇，激发我们的想象力，当我们最终放慢脚步去看时，我们会在它们身上看到很多自己的影子。动物将我们与自然联系在一起，是一个强有力的讲故事的渠道。",
	"This is why I believe roleplaying games have had such a resurgence in the past few years, because we're looking for a connection to the world around us. We're looking for a way to get away from screens, to forget about our complicated lives, and to live as heroes with problems we can solve, not just listen to on the news and worry about. We can help people, we can be heroes, and we have magic. Even in the imagination, these things are incredibly powerful.": "这就是为什么我相信角色扮演游戏在过去几年有如此大的复苏，因为我们正在寻找与我们周围世界的联系。我们正在寻找一种远离屏幕的方法，忘记我们复杂的生活，并作为英雄生活在我们可以解决的问题中，而不仅仅是听新闻和担心。我们可以帮助别人，我们可以成为英雄，而且我们有魔法。即使在想象中，这些东西也是令人难以置信的强大。",
	"In Humblewood, we're going back to our roots as storytellers, using nature and the animals around us to adventure in a world of fantasy. We have so much technology surrounding us every day, getting out into nature isn't an option for many. Our jobs are time consuming, our lives are hard and complicated, our food is grown in places we will never see and sits on a shelf for our consumption wrapped in plastic. These things disconnect us from the story of nature, from the story of life and the changing of seasons and our connection to the world around us. In reality, even the humble pigeon has an interesting life, we just don't see it as we pass them on city streets without giving them a second look.": "在汉伯伍德，我们要回到我们作为讲故事者的根源，利用自然和我们周围的动物，在一个幻想的世界里冒险。我们每天都有这么多的技术围绕着我们，对许多人来说，走到大自然中去不是一个选择。我们的工作耗费时间，我们的生活艰难而复杂，我们的食物是在我们永远不会看到的地方种植的，并在塑料包装的货架上供我们食用。这些东西使我们与大自然的故事脱节，与生命的故事和季节的变化以及我们与周围世界的联系脱节。在现实中，即使是卑微的鸽子也有一个有趣的生活，只是我们没有看到，因为我们在城市街道上与它们擦肩而过，没有多看它们一眼。",
	"I've loved birds since I can remember, they've always been how I connected to nature. I've rescued birds since I was 10 and I've worked with the smallest of hummingbirds to the massive moody, Red Tailed hawk named Ivan whose mew I cleaned in college. When I lived in Los Angeles, I began rescuing pigeons because they were everywhere, forgotten pets of colonists and invasive to the habitat they lived in. These birds were smart, funny, and ignored by almost every animal shelter you took them to. They were the lost and forgotten of the animal world, and that's why I fell in love with them. They had stories to tell, and every one of them has their own personality and quirks.": "从我记事起，我就喜欢鸟类，它们一直是我与大自然联系的方式。我从10岁起就开始救助鸟类，从最小的蜂鸟到巨大的喜怒无常的红尾鹰，名叫伊万，我在大学时曾为它清理喵喵。当我住在洛杉矶时，我开始救助鸽子，因为它们无处不在，是被殖民者遗忘的宠物，对它们生活的栖息地具有侵略性。这些鸟儿聪明、有趣，而且几乎被你带去的每个动物收容所忽视。它们是动物世界中的迷失者和被遗忘者，这就是我爱上它们的原因。它们有故事可讲，而且每只都有自己的个性和怪癖。",
	"Humans are not that different from animals. If we pay attention to them, we can understand them, save them, live with them, and honor them. The more compassion we have for animals the better our world will be. Telling their stories is just as important as telling our own, and helps us connect to and have compassion for the other creatures on our planet. So I encourage you to make your own legends in Humblewood, and then go to the forest and see them for yourself. Maybe they'll have a story of their own to tell you, too.": "人类与动物没有什么不同。如果我们关注它们，我们就能理解它们，拯救它们，与它们一起生活，并尊重它们。我们对动物的同情心越强，我们的世界就越美好。讲述它们的故事和讲述我们自己的故事一样重要，有助于我们与地球上的其他生物建立联系，并对它们抱有同情心。因此，我鼓励你在汉伯伍德创造你自己的传说，然后到森林里去亲自看看它们。也许它们也会有自己的故事要告诉你。",

	"When approaching the art direction for Humblewood, I wanted to express that this is a world full of vibrant, diverse characters, living in an expansive forest with a rich and intricate history. The driving force behind Humblewood as a concept was the desire to create a visually compelling world that felt alive, and that meant a world that could feel wonderful and welcoming, magical and mysterious. It also meant a world full of secrets, hidden dangers, and obstacles for a party of adventurers to overcome.": "当接近汉伯伍德的艺术指导时，我想表达的是，这是一个充满了充满活力、多样化的人物的世界，他们生活在一个有着丰富而复杂的历史的广阔的森林中。汉伯伍德作为一个概念背后的驱动力是希望创造一个视觉上引人注目的世界，让人感觉到生命力，这意味着一个可以感觉到美妙和温馨、神奇和神秘的世界。这也意味着一个充满秘密、隐藏的危险和障碍的世界，供冒险者的队伍去克服。",
	"When I was young, the films and books I devoured with the most enthusiasm were the ones that appealed to audiences both young and old, whose characters may happen to be adorable woodland animals, but still bravely explored a mosaic of complex, confronting themes that we continue to puzzle over well into our adult years. These are the stories that left a significant impression on me, that I continue to revisit to this day.": "在我年轻的时候，我最热衷的电影和书籍是那些吸引年轻人和老年人的电影和书籍，它们的角色可能碰巧是可爱的林地动物，但仍然勇敢地探索了复杂的、对抗性的主题，我们在成年后仍会继续困惑。这些故事给我留下了深刻的印象，直到今天我还在继续重温这些故事。",
	"Roleplaying games are wonderful for many reasons, one being that they can provide a form of escape, or they can mirror reality. They can help us understand and process experiences in our own lives through an entirely different lens, and they give you a unique kind of freedom to be whoever or whatever you want to be, options for which there is no shortage in Humblewood—whether you are a sneaky mapach, a brave little strig, or a cunning corvum with a secret heart of gold, the only limit, as ever, is your imagination.": "角色扮演游戏之所以精彩，有很多原因，其中一个原因是它们可以提供一种逃避的形式，或者它们可以反映现实。它们可以帮助我们通过一个完全不同的视角来理解和处理我们自己的生活经历，它们给你一种独特的自由，让你成为你想成为的人或事，在Humblewood不乏这样的选择--无论你是一个阴险的Mapach，一个勇敢的小strig，还是一个狡猾的corvum，有一颗秘密的黄金之心，唯一的限制，一如既往，就是你的想象力。",
	"As artists we have to give careful consideration to every facet of the world, certainly the designs of our main characters and our myriad of monsters, but also what a character's home might look like, what kind of fabrics they might wear, and how should we design this bottle of vintage vulpin-crafted elderberry wine? We have illustrated forests flooded with beams of light, tangled and treacherous swamps you must battle your way through with determination, and cosy interiors where you can almost smell the jerbeen-sized loaves baking in the oven. The love is very often in the details, just as some of the most significant moments in a campaign can be the quiet ones, the small words exchanged at the campfire, or the tiny clues indicating a much larger mystery to unravel.": "作为艺术家，我们必须仔细考虑世界的方方面面，当然，我们的主角和无数的怪物的设计，但也要考虑角色的家可能是什么样子，他们可能穿什么样的面料，以及我们应该如何设计这瓶古老的Vulpin制作的接骨木酒？我们绘制了充斥着光束的森林、纠结而险恶的沼泽地，你必须坚定地穿过这些地方，还有舒适的室内环境，你几乎可以闻到烤箱里烘烤的杰比恩大小的面包。爱往往体现在细节中，正如一场战役中最重要的一些时刻可能是安静的时刻，在篝火旁交换的小话，或表明要解开更大的谜团的微小线索。",
	"Creating this project has been an unforgettable journey, full of as many surprises, twists and turns as the overgrown paths of Humblewood itself. I have had an affinity for nature and animals my entire life, which has been my primary source of inspiration for much of my personal work. I remember when I first sat down and sketched the first iteration of a brave little knight owl, who we have now named Riffin, and I could never have imagined in that moment how the idea behind this little owl would evolve into a fully realised world, lovingly crafted by our team of designers, writers and artists, for players to explore.": "创作这个项目是一个难忘的旅程，像汉伯伍德的杂草丛生的小路一样充满了惊喜、曲折和转折。我一生都对自然和动物情有独钟，这是我许多个人作品的主要灵感来源。我记得当我第一次坐下来画出一只勇敢的小猫头鹰（我们现在把它命名为Riffin）的第一稿时，我在那一刻根本无法想象这只小猫头鹰背后的想法会如何演变为一个完全实现的世界，由我们的设计师、作家和艺术家团队精心打造，供玩家探索。",

	"In the far away world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and the humblefolk. Together they share the Wood and its bountiful resources.": "在遥远的埃弗登世界，在一个大洲的东海岸，有一片巨大的森林，依偎在山和海之间。这就是谦卑之林，一个古老而神奇的地方，它哼着无尽的歌，随着生与死的大节奏而歌唱。森林，正如它的居民所知道的那样，与其他森林不同。这里的树木古老而强大，稀有的标本可以达到小山一样的高度。在这里，熟悉的野兽成长为不寻常的大小，带有森林特有的标记和图案。这个地区也是两组类似动物的人形种族的家园，鸟人和卑微的人。他们共同分享森林和它丰富的资源。",
	"In the early years, the birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest. These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the \"Bandit Coalition.\" To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest's canopy. Joining forces with the humblefolk, the birdfolk army, known as the \"Perch Guard\", drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood.": "早年，鸟人和卑贱的人在森林周围的小村庄里彼此相邻而居。这些孤立的社区很容易受到一个自称为 \"强盗联盟 \"的强盗和掠夺者组织的攻击。为了保护自己免受联盟的侵害，鸟人在森林的树冠上建造了坚固的城市。鸟人军队与卑微的人类联合起来，被称为 \"鲈鱼卫队\"，赶走了强盗，给这个地区带来了和平与安全。随着时间的推移，鸟人文化不断传播，首都阿尔德心成为森林中最具政治影响力的地方。",
	"But the Wood has also known sorrow. Not long after the founding of Alderheart, a massive forest fire known as \"The Great Calamity\" burned a portion of the Wood. The origins of the fire are unknown, but it left the area permanently damaged. To this day, it is called the \"Scorched Grove,\" an arid field of ash that has since become home to many strange flame-infused creatures.": "但森林也有过悲伤。在Alderheart成立后不久，一场被称为 \"大灾难 \"的大规模森林火灾烧毁了森林的一部分。这场大火的起因不明，但它给该地区留下了永久性的破坏。时至今日，这里被称为 \"焦土林\"，是一片干旱的灰烬地，从此成为许多奇怪的火焰生物的家园。",
	"The Tenders, an organization of druids and mystics, dedicate themselves to healing the Scorched Grove with natural magics. Set up in conclaves around the Wood, they provide aid whenever forest fires strike. Yet, since the Grove's burning, the Wood has known relatively few fires. Nature's balance, though, can be disrupted by a single spark.": "补给者，一个由德鲁伊和神秘主义者组成的组织，致力于用自然魔法治愈焦土森林。他们在森林周围建立了小团体，每当森林火灾发生时，他们都会提供帮助。然而，自从丛林被烧毁后，森林就很少发生火灾了。不过，大自然的平衡可能会被一个小小的火花所破坏。",
	"Recently, fires have begun to rage through the Wood with a strength and fury not seen since ages past. Forest-dwellers are again being displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in Alderheart, and perch-dwellers are doing what they can to keep themselves safe up in their canopy sanctuaries. Relations between the humblefolk and birdfolk are tense. Moreover, a newly invigorated Bandit Coalition swells in numbers. Its sights are set upon Alderheart, where those displaced by the flames seek a means of survival.": "最近，大火开始在森林中肆虐，火势之猛烈是历代以来所没有的。森林居民再次被赶出他们的家园，在阿尔德心寻求庇护，而栖息地居民则尽其所能地在他们的天幕避难所中保护自己的安全。卑微的人和鸟人之间的关系很紧张。此外，一个新成立的强盗联盟的人数也在增加。他们把目光投向了阿尔德心，在那里，那些因火焰而流离失所的人正在寻找生存的方法。",

	"This chapter outlines the ten core races, five birdfolk and five humblefolk, who make up the majority of characters found in the Wood. It also details various character creation options, new class options, backgrounds, feats, and spells to help you make your own Humblewood adventurer.": "本章概述了十个核心种族，五个鸟人和五个谦卑人，他们构成了在森林中发现的大多数角色。它还详细介绍了各种角色创建选项、新的等级选项、背景、特技和法术，以帮助你打造自己的谦卑森林冒险者。",
	"The birdfolk races of Humblewood are as diverse and unique as the forest itself. Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as \"perches\") throughout the Wood. Despite regional differences and cultural peculiarities among the different kinds of birdfolk in the Wood, the birdfolk races nevertheless share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. This solidarity has allowed them to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age.": "汉伯伍德的鸟人种族就像森林本身一样多样而独特。只有技艺高超的人才能在森林中生存，而鸟人已经成为森林地面和树冠的主人，在整个森林中建立了几个定居点（俗称 \"栖息地\"）。尽管森林中不同种类的鸟人之间存在着地区差异和文化特点，但鸟人种族仍然共享他们的大部分文化、语言、历史和起源神话。这种团结使他们能够一起工作和繁荣，在森林中创造了一个持续了一个时代的和谐。",
	"While a diverse group, adapted for a variety of environments within the Wood, birdfolk also share several physical traits which have allowed them to find common ground in the construction of their perches. Beyond the obvious physical similarities, all birdfolk possess arms covered in feathers, which extend into wing-like appendages. While incapable of true powered flight, the strong hollow bones and lightweight bodies of birdfolk allow them to easily use their feathered arms to glide, and unless severely encumbered, all birdfolk can recover gracefully from what would otherwise be a deadly fall. In some birdfolk races these wings have grown strong enough to bear their owners upwards in a mighty flap, while others instead developed talons which make for both deadly defensive weapons and useful tools for scaling tall trees.": "虽然是一个多样化的群体，适应森林中的各种环境，但鸟人也有几个共同的身体特征，这使得他们在建造他们的栖息地时能够找到共同点。除了明显的身体相似性，所有的鸟人都拥有覆盖着羽毛的手臂，这些手臂延伸成类似翅膀的附属物。虽然没有能力进行真正的动力飞行，但鸟人强壮的空心骨和轻盈的身体使他们能够轻松地使用他们的羽毛手臂进行滑翔，除非有严重的障碍，否则所有的鸟人都能从本来是致命的坠落中优雅地恢复。在一些鸟人种族中，这些翅膀已经强大到足以在强大的扇动中把它们的主人往上带，而另一些则发展出爪子，既是致命的防御武器，也是攀爬高大树木的有用工具。",
	"The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart, and from this bastion of safety their ruling body, the Birdfolk Council, makes decisions which impact all of Humblewood. The birdfolk are well-defended from outside threats thanks to the Perch Guard, a force of soldiers trained in both aerial and ground combat, that keeps their cities and the denizens within safe.": "鸟人已经确立了自己在汉伯伍德不可忽视的政治力量。他们在伟大的树Alderheart上塑造了他们强大的首都，在这个安全堡垒上，他们的统治机构，鸟人委员会，做出了影响整个汉伯伍德的决定。鸟人对外界的威胁有很好的防御，这要归功于Perch Guard，这是一支受过空中和地面战斗训练的士兵队伍，保证了他们的城市和居民的安全。",
	"While Alderheart has been a beacon of peace and harmony for many years, the coming of the fires has thrown the region into chaos. The Perch Guard forces are spread thin across the canopy cities, barely able to secure the main roads for merchants while keeping their homes safe from the blazes. Now the great birdfolk cities face more threats from bandits and forest fires than ever before. Through it all, though, the birdfolk trust in solidarity, between themselves and the diverse groups of habitants who call their perches home, to weather the coming storm as they have so many times before.": "虽然多年来阿尔德心一直是和平与和谐的灯塔，但大火的到来使该地区陷入混乱。栖息地卫队的力量被分散到各个天幕城市，勉强能够为商人确保主要道路的安全，同时保证他们的家园不被大火烧毁。现在，伟大的鸟人城市面临着比以往更多的来自土匪和森林火灾的威胁。然而，在这一切中，鸟人相信他们自己和以他们的栖息地为家的不同居民群体之间的团结，以抵御即将到来的风暴，就像他们以前多次经历的那样。",
	"Not all denizens of Humblewood are birdfolk. The term \"humblefolk\" is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood's history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven't always seen eye to eye.": "并非所有汉伯伍德的居民都是鸟人。在整个森林里，\"谦卑人 \"这个词被用来指代那些生活在离森林地表稍近的非鸟人民族。与鸟人不同，他们共同的语言、历史、神话和文化使他们在汉伯伍德的大部分历史中都能和谐地存在，而谦卑人代表了一群不同的民族、文化和看待世界的方式，他们中的许多人并不总是能看到眼睛。",
	"Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the \"Humblefolk Treaty\" and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. The birdfolk offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted their offer. Over time, more and more humblefolk migrated to newly-established birdfolk perches, though many found birdfolk architecture to be restrictive for creatures without wings. In the same way, some groups of birdfolk, feeling too crowded within the booming perches, began to spread out and seek shelter within small woodland villages. Even today, the birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.": "数年前，森林底层的人们达成了一项协议，联合起来对抗流窜的强盗，平息了肆虐整个森林的内斗。这项协议被称为 \"卑微者条约\"，并由鸟人见证，他们当时刚刚开始塑造阿尔德心的树干。鸟人在他们伟大的城市里为卑微的人们提供安全，许多人接受了他们的提议。随着时间的推移，越来越多的卑微者移居到新建立的鸟人栖息地，尽管许多人发现鸟人的建筑对没有翅膀的生物来说是有限制的。同样地，一些鸟人群体感到在繁荣的栖息地内太过拥挤，开始分散开来，在小的林地村庄内寻求庇护。即使在今天，选择生活在森林地面上的鸟人发现自己被鄙视了，因为在鸟人社会中，树冠上的生活被认为是正当的。",
	"After the establishment of the treaty, humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, although now in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous...until the fires came.": "条约签订后，谦卑人开始再次生活在树下的小型林地村庄里，尽管现在他们与一些地面居住的鸟人组成了更加多样化的社区。随着《谦卑人条约》的扩大，允许谦卑人在危机时刻召唤栖息地卫队，以及鸟人民兵为商队保持道路安全，森林真正进入了一个黄金时代。许多平民的生活是和平和繁荣的......直到大火来临。",
	"With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified: those who found prosperity in the birdfolk cities have adopted a perch-dweller's perspective, while those who live in the woodlands face a constant threat from brigands and forest fires. Others have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment. Yet, where the treaty holds, vibrant humblefolk communities can still be found. The humblefolk are resilient, and each race will devise a way to survive in this dangerous wood.": "随着火焰的蔓延，卑微的村民向过度扩张的栖息地卫队请求援助，但看到援助到达得太晚，甚至根本没有。更糟糕的是，多年之后，卑微人社区之间的分歧加剧了：那些在鸟人城市发现繁荣的人采用了栖息地居民的观点，而那些生活在林地的人则面临着来自强盗和森林火灾的持续威胁。其他人甚至已经离开，加入了新改革的强盗联盟，他们不仅看到了一条生存之路，还看到了与栖息在鸟人中的人报复违背誓言和不平等待遇的机会。然而，在条约生效的地方，仍然可以找到充满活力的卑微人社区。卑贱的人们具有顽强的生命力，每个种族都会想出办法在这片危险的森林中生存。",

	"Your character is more than just a collection of rules. Here are a few tools to help you flesh out the look and feel of your character.": "你的角色不仅仅是一个规则的集合。这里有一些工具可以帮助你充实你的角色的外观和感觉。",
	"The sex or gender of a character doesn't confer any special bonuses or penalties. Playable races do not exhibit physical characteristics based on sex, and traits such as plumage, markings, and size difference are not associated with a specific sex or gender. The most significant variations in physical appearance come down to a character's subrace.": "一个角色的性别并不赋予任何特殊的奖励或惩罚。可玩的种族不表现出基于性别的身体特征，而诸如羽翼、斑纹和尺寸差异等特征也不与特定的性别相关联。外貌上最重要的变化来自于一个角色的亚种族。",
	"The table below can be used to decide your character's height and weight. These are based on the information provided in each race's description, and reflect the natural variation that occurs within the different folk of the Wood.": "下面的表格可以用来决定你的角色的身高和体重。这些都是基于每个种族描述中所提供的信息，并反映了木头人的不同民俗中所发生的自然变化。",
	"To use this table, first locate your character's race, and roll for their height modifier. Add this result in inches to the base height shown in the previous column. Next, using the appropriate column, roll for your weight modifier. Some races have a flat weight modifier. If this is the case, simply use the number provided in this column. Then, take the number you rolled for the height modifier, and multiply it by the weight modifier. Add this result in pounds to your race's base weight.": "要使用这个表格，首先要找到你的角色的种族，然后滚出他们的身高修正值。把这个结果以英寸为单位加到前一栏所示的基本身高上。接下来，使用适当的栏目，滚出你的体重修正值。有些种族有一个统一的体重修正值。如果是这种情况，只需使用这一栏中提供的数字。然后，用你掷出的身高修正数，乘以体重修正数。把这个结果以磅为单位加到你的种族的基本体重上。",
	"You may notice that the weights for birdfolk races are significantly lower than for humblefolk of similar size. The birdfolk have hollow bones, reinforced by special internal structures that act as struts. Along with other weight-reducing adaptations, this allows birdfolk to glide. Birdfolk characters are not negatively impacted by their lower weight.": "你可能会注意到，鸟人种族的重量明显低于类似体型的卑鄙小人。鸟人的骨头是空心的，由特殊的内部结构加固，起到支撑的作用。与其他减轻重量的适应性一起，这使得鸟人可以滑行。鸟人角色不会因其较低的体重而受到不利影响。",

	"The sizes listed in the racial descriptions represent suggested averages of the various races. Players can adjust these sizes depending on the kind of birdfolk or humblefolk character they'd like to play. Some varieties of strig, a race that takes their physical characteristics from owls, could be smaller sized, around 3 feet tall, if desired. Similarly, raptors, a race whose physical characteristics resemble birds of prey, could reach around 5 feet in height. For the sake of simplicity we advise that, regardless of the physical measurements of a character, they follow the size category rules of their race (Medium or Small). In the lore, this can be expressed by saying that even a small strig is solid and strong, where even a taller raptor is light and agile. This will make calculating things that rely on size categories much easier, rather than having to remember which size variant a player has chosen for a race.": "种族描述中列出的尺寸代表了不同种族的建议平均数。玩家可以根据他们想扮演的鸟人或卑鄙小人的角色来调整这些尺寸。如果需要的话，从猫头鹰获得身体特征的某些品种的斯特里格（strig），可以是较小的尺寸，大约3英尺高。同样，猛禽，一个身体特征类似于猛禽的种族，身高可以达到5英尺左右。为了简单起见，我们建议，无论一个角色的身体尺寸如何，他们都要遵循其种族的尺寸类别规则（中型或小型）。在传说中，这可以表述为：即使是一只小的斯特里格也是坚实有力的，而即使是一只高大的猛禽也是轻盈敏捷的。这将使依赖体型分类的计算变得更加容易，而不是要记住玩家为一个种族选择的体型变量。",
	"Alternatively, if the races presented here are too big when placed in comparison to humans in other campaign settings, size categories can be adjusted accordingly. This is entirely a matter of taste. It is recommended to do whatever makes the most sense for the kinds of worlds you'd like to build and the kinds of stories you'd like to tell.": "另外，如果这里介绍的种族与其他战役环境中的人类相比显得太大，可以对尺寸类别进行相应调整。这完全是一个品味问题。建议做任何对你想建立的世界类型和你想讲述的故事类型最有意义的事情。",
	"The Wood covers a vast area of different environments. As such, birdfolk and humblefolk can showcase a variety of different forms.

	"Cervan characters could be imagined as elk, moose, or antelopes. Any hoofed creature with horns would fit the bill, especially those native to forest or mountainous environments. While not every cervan has horns, the ability to grow them is seen as a blessing of Cairith, and is a part of their culture.": "塞万的角色可以想象成麋鹿、驼鹿或羚羊。任何有角的有蹄动物都适合，尤其是那些原产于森林或山区环境的动物。虽然不是每个塞万人都有角，但长角的能力被看作是凯里斯的祝福，也是他们文化的一部分。",
	"Birds which are known for their dark coloration, such as crows, blackbirds and grackles, would be a good visual fit. Despite typically being dark-feathered, a variety of colorful corvids exist. Jays, nutcrackers, and jackdaws are good examples.": "以深色著称的鸟类，如乌鸦、黑鸟和斑鸠，将是一个很好的视觉搭配。尽管通常是深色羽毛，但也有各种色彩斑斓的鸟类存在。鸦类、坚果鸟和乌鸦就是很好的例子。",
	"No matter which type of bird is being used for visual inspiration for your corvum, it is important that they have at least one black feather. Black feathers on a corvum are known as the \"Mark of Gesme\" and they are thought to impart some of Gesme's reckless curiosity.": "无论哪种类型的鸟被用来作为你的corvum的视觉灵感，重要的是它们至少有一根黑色的羽毛。雕像上的黑色羽毛被称为 \"Gesme的标志\"，它们被认为能传授Gesme的一些鲁莽的好奇心。",
	"Gallus characters are usually represented by land fowl of all kinds, ranging from those with small rounded bodies, suited to ground life, to those with longer proportions. Waterfowl, such as ducks or geese, could be used as visual inspiration for communities of gallus living by Humblewood's wetlands. Other fowl, such as peacocks, could also be used. While not closely-related to fowl, herons, storks, and bitterns could be a good reference for taller, marshland-dwelling communities of gallus.": "胆小鬼的特征通常由各种陆禽来代表，从那些身体小而圆、适合地面生活的陆禽到那些比例较长的陆禽。水禽，如鸭子或鹅，可以作为生活在汉伯伍德湿地边上的gallus社区的视觉灵感。其他禽类，如孔雀，也可以使用。虽然与禽类关系不密切，但苍鹭、鹳和苦鸟可以作为较高的、居住在沼泽地的五倍子群落的良好参考。",
	"Gallus characters with ostentatious, colorful plumage are generally better suited to the bright gallus subrace, while those with modest, earth-toned feathers might be better suited to the huden gallus subrace.": "具有炫耀性的、五彩缤纷的羽毛的胆小鬼一般更适合于明亮的胆小鬼亚种，而那些具有适度的、大地色调的羽毛的胆小鬼可能更适合于胡登胆小鬼亚种。",
	"While inspired by hedgehogs, having a hedge character based on a quilled animal that inhabits forests, such as a porcupine, would also make sense. Although they would probably not be native to Humblewood, armadillos, pangolins, or echidnas would also work.": "虽然灵感来自于刺猬，但以栖息在森林中的被子动物为基础的刺猬角色，如豪猪，也会有意义。虽然它们可能不是Humblewood的原生动物，但犰狳、穿山甲或针鼹鼠也可以。",
	"The jerbeens are inspired by jerboas, a kind of jumping mouse. Other small rodents with mouse-like proportions, including chinchillas, could be used for visual inspiration as well. Though a greater stretch, the jerbeen's speed, size, and communal way of life would make them an ideal analog for races based on rabbits or hares.": "jerbeens的灵感来自于jerboas，一种跳跃的老鼠。其他具有类似老鼠比例的小型啮齿动物，包括龙猫，也可以用来作为视觉灵感。虽然更夸张，但杰比安的速度、体型和集体生活方式将使它们成为基于兔子或野兔的比赛的理想类似物。",
	"Lumas are inspired by doves and pigeons, but their size and high charisma means that small songbirds such as chickadees, wrens, sparrows, and cardinals would also be a good fit. A bird-of-paradise could be used as well due to their focus on performance, though they might be better suited for visitors to Humblewood from more tropical regions. Birds with brighter or more decorative plumage would correspond to sera lumas, while those with more muted feathers would be better as sable lumas.": "卢马的灵感来自鸽子和鸽子，但它们的体型和高魅力意味着小型鸣禽，如鸡冠鸟、鹪鹩、麻雀和红雀也会很适合。由于天堂鸟注重表现，所以也可以使用，尽管它们可能更适合于来自更多热带地区的汉伯伍德的游客。羽毛较亮或装饰性较强的鸟类将对应于sera lumas，而那些羽毛较暗的鸟类则更适合作为sable lumas。",
	"Inspired by raccoons, mapach characters can reference members of the weasel family, such as ferrets and badgers. Mapachs are hearty and crafty, and possess a climbing speed, which means many members of this family, including polecats, would be good fits.": "受浣熊的启发，马帕奇的角色可以参考黄鼠狼家族的成员，如雪貂和獾。马帕奇酣畅淋漓，狡猾无比，并且拥有攀爬的速度，这意味着这个家族的许多成员，包括竹竿猫，都会很适合。",
	"Raptors take after smaller birds of prey, like falcons and hawks, but using larger species, like eagles or vultures as a reference would also work for raptor characters. Maran raptors could also take visual inspiration from seabirds, notably petrels or shearwaters, due to their swim speed.": "猛禽模仿较小的猎物，如猎鹰和老鹰，但使用较大的物种，如老鹰或秃鹰作为参考，也适用于猛禽角色。马兰猛禽也可以从海鸟那里获得视觉灵感，特别是海燕或剪羊毛，因为它们的游泳速度。",
	"Strigs usually resemble owls of all kinds. Owls comprise a very large and diverse family of birds, and examples can be found which are small, large, or unique in appearance. For larger, more intimidating strigs, the great gray owl or giant scops owl can provide a robust presence, while smaller strigs could take inspiration from the little owl, or boreal owl. Regardless of their size, stout strigs tend to be bulkier, with denser feathers, while swift strigs have more slender and streamlined bodies.": "斯特里格通常类似于各种类型的猫头鹰。猫头鹰是一个非常大的、多样化的鸟类家族，可以找到小的、大的或独特外观的例子。对于较大的、更具威慑力的绞杀者来说，大灰猫头鹰或大鸱鸮可以提供一个强大的存在，而较小的绞杀者可以从小猫头鹰或北方猫头鹰那里得到灵感。不管它们的尺寸如何，粗壮的绞龙往往体积较大，羽毛较密，而敏捷的绞龙则有更细长和流线型的身体。",
	"Vulpins generally look like foxes, but an alternative visual reference would be wolves, coyotes, or other hunting canines that could be commonly found in a forest environment. Vulpins should be represented as wild animals, to illustrate the duality of their sophisticated yet savage nature. Breeds of tamed dogs would not be a good fit.": "狐狸一般看起来像狐狸，但另一种视觉参考是狼、土狼或其他在森林环境中常见的狩猎犬类。狐狸精应该被表现为野生动物，以说明其复杂而野蛮的本质的双重性。驯养的狗的品种不会是一个好的选择。",
	"Race determines the language your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional language of your choice. You are free to select these from among the languages offered in other 5e material, but there are several languages which are specific to the Wood.": "种族决定了你的角色默认能说的语言，而你的背景可能让你获得一种或多种你选择的额外语言。你可以从其他5e材料中提供的语言中自由选择这些语言，但有几种语言是木头人特有的。",
	"The standard languages listed below are part of common life in Humblewood, and are spoken widely. Sylvan, along with various dialects of Primordial (Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran) are uncommon languages known only by few in the Wood, but they can prove exceptionally useful in communicating with the various fey and elemental Humblewood residents.": "下面列出的标准语言是汉伯伍德普通生活的一部分，并且被广泛使用。西尔凡语和各种原始方言（奥兰语、阿奎恩语、伊格南语和泰兰语）是不常见的语言，只有伍德中的少数人知道，但它们在与各种精灵和元素的汉伯伍德居民交流时可以证明非常有用。",
	"Each birdfolk race possesses a unique and mystical connection to the element of air, which allows them to understand Auran from birth, although they are unable to speak it naturally. Birdfolk who wish to become fluent in this dialect must take the time to learn. Because Auran is a dialect of Primordial, birdfolk innately understand Aquan, Ignan, and Terran as well, though not perfectly. Compared to Auran, the other dialects of Primordial sound stilted or broken to birdfolk. While they can understand simple concepts presented in these dialects, more complicated matters are lost in translation.": "每个鸟人种族都与空气元素有着独特而神秘的联系，这使他们一出生就能理解奥兰语，尽管他们无法自然地说出这种语言。希望精通这种方言的鸟人必须花时间来学习。由于奥兰语是一种原始方言，鸟人天生也能理解阿奎恩语、伊格恩语和泰兰语，尽管并不完美。与奥兰语相比，其他的原始方言对鸟人来说听起来很生硬或蹩脚。虽然他们可以理解这些方言中的简单概念，但更复杂的事情却在翻译中丢失了。",
	"Birdfolk takes the place of Common in Humblewood. As the language of trade and custom, folk of the Wood take the time to learn it. Other 5e races who choose to visit Humblewood will want to know Birdfolk. Likewise, birdfolk or humblefolk characters visiting other lands should add Common to their language list.": "在汉伯伍德，Birdfolk取代了Common的位置。作为贸易和风俗的语言，森林里的人们花时间来学习它。其他选择访问汉伯伍德的5e种族会想知道鸟人语。同样地，鸟人或谦卑人的角色在访问其他地方时，也应该在他们的语言列表中加入普通话。",

	"In the beginning, there was only the sound of wings. Faint at first, the distant beats were easy to miss, but as time passed they grew stronger, faster, until they could be heard across the great unending dark. Then, with a single flap, creation burst forth: fire, ice, air, water, soil and sky, all came from the sound of feathers that resonated throughout the cosmos. This is the Great Rhythm, and by the Great Rhythm are all things moved. The Rhythm tells the sun when to set, and the moon when to rise. The Rhythm tells the seeds when to flower, the trees when to shed their leaves, and the snows when to fall. The essence of everything there is comes from the Great Rhythm. One day, the Rhythm may cue the end of creation—but there will be no end to the Rhythm itself. As every downbeat has an upbeat to follow it, so too will the cycles of nature eventually start again—for even though the Rhythm can be faint at times, it is everlasting and eternal.": "一开始，只有翅膀的声音。起初很微弱，远处的节拍很容易被错过，但随着时间的推移，它们越来越强，越来越快，直到它们在巨大的无尽黑暗中都能被听到。然后，随着一次扇动，创造迸发出来：火、冰、空气、水、土壤和天空，都来自在整个宇宙中产生共鸣的羽毛声。这就是伟大的节奏，所有的东西都被伟大的节奏所感动。韵律告诉太阳何时落下，月亮何时升起。节奏告诉种子何时开花，树木何时落叶，雪花何时飘落。一切事物的本质都来自于伟大的韵律。有一天，节奏可能会提示创造的结束，但节奏本身不会结束。就像每一个下降的节拍都有一个上升的节拍一样，自然界的循环也将最终重新开始--尽管节奏有时会很微弱，但它是永恒的，而且是永恒的。",
	"Every denizen of the forest, from the large to the small, from predator to prey, knows of The Great Rhythm: the beating force that is the pulse of life itself. To the birdfolk, the Rhythm began with the sound of beating wings, but other folk of the Wood tell that it began with the thundering of hooves, the padding of paws, or with a tiny heartbeat. Birdfolk believe that two great spirits emerged from the Rhythm. They were the first Amaranthine: Ardea, whose wings usher in the dawn, and Tyton, whose wings are the shadow of night. They are the avatars of life and death, and keepers of the Rhythm.": "森林里的每一个居民，从大到小，从捕食者到猎物，都知道伟大的节奏：那是生命本身的跳动力量。对鸟人来说，节奏始于翅膀拍打的声音，但森林里的其他居民则说，它始于马蹄的雷鸣声、爪子的垫子，或者是一个微小的心跳。鸟人相信，有两个伟大的灵魂从节奏中出现。他们是第一个阿玛兰特人。阿蒂亚（Ardea），它的翅膀迎来了黎明；泰顿（Tyton），它的翅膀是夜晚的阴影。他们是生命和死亡的化身，也是节奏的守护者。",

They are the immortals, who have been given new life by the Rhythm, and act as its guardians, maintaining the balance of nature.": "就像我们需要一颗心脏来使我们的脉搏跳动一样，节奏也需要一个鼓手。节奏的核心在于阿玛兰蒂人。他们是不死之身，被节奏赋予了新的生命，并作为节奏的守护者，维持着自然的平衡。",
	"The Amaranthine are the gods of Everden. They are entrusted with maintaining the cosmic balance known as the Great Rhythm.

The Amaranthine tend to keep to themselves, and rarely meddle in each other's affairs.": "Amaranthine是Everden的诸神。他们被委以重任，负责维护被称为大节奏的宇宙平衡。与其他环境中的神灵不同，阿玛兰蒂恩人很少彼此争吵，因为阿玛兰蒂恩人之间的任何纷争都是对自然平衡本身的威胁。阿玛兰蒂恩人倾向于保持自我，很少插手对方的事务。",
	"Though each Amaranthine is a powerful being in their own right, holding a great degree of autonomy over their dominion, each understands that they are but a small part of a greater whole. Like the themes of a concerto, the Amaranthine are the harmonies that create the Great Rhythm.": "尽管每一个阿玛兰斯人本身就是一个强大的存在，对他们的统治区拥有很大程度的自主权，但每个人都明白，他们只是一个更大的整体中的一小部分。就像协奏曲的主题一样，阿玛兰斯人是创造大节奏的和声。",
	"The Amaranthine are venerated by all races of Humblewood, although birdfolk and humblefolk worship them differently. The five whose origins are described in the \"Tales of the Amaranthine\" (Altus, Clhuran, Gesme, Reya, and Hanera), are primarily worshiped by birdfolk, and they (along with Ardea and Tyton) form the most common pantheon worshiped across the Wood.": "阿玛兰斯人受到汉伯伍德所有种族的敬仰，尽管鸟人和汉伯伍德人对他们的崇拜有所不同。在 \"阿玛兰人的故事 \"中描述了五个人的起源（阿尔图斯、克赫兰、格斯梅、雷亚和哈内拉），他们主要受到鸟人的崇拜，他们（与阿迪亚和泰顿一起）构成了整个森林中最常见的被崇拜的万神殿。",

	"In the perches, humblefolk Amaranthine tend to be viewed as a folk religion alongside the primary birdfolk pantheon. Occasionally, perch-dwelling humblefolk will have small shrines in their homes, or in their shops dedicated to their Amaranthine.": "在栖息地，小民的阿玛兰蒂恩往往被视为一种民间宗教，与主要的鸟民神殿并列。偶尔，住在栖息地的小民会在家里或商店里有小神龛，专门供奉他们的阿玛兰蒂恩。",
	"While these Amaranthine go largely overlooked by most birdfolk, some who have taken the time to learn their legends pay homage to the featherless Amaranthine. This bothers a few humblefolk, but the priests of these Amaranthine understand that each one is but a reflection of the Great Rhythm, and welcome any birdfolk to learn from them.": "虽然这些亚马逊人在很大程度上被大多数鸟人所忽视，但一些花时间学习他们的传说的人对无羽亚马逊人表示敬意。这让一些卑微的人感到不安，但这些阿玛兰蒂恩的祭司们明白，每一个人都是伟大节奏的反映，并欢迎任何鸟人向他们学习。",

	"With the birth of Ardea and Tyton, the world was set into motion. Where once there was nothing but barrens, the land came alive with the coming of the Amaranthine, and the world began its endless cycle of life and death. Their arrival split the formless sky into day and night. They created the sun and the moon, and the succession of light and dark which emerged from their movement across the heavens told all life when to act and when to rest. Ardea and Tyton were born from opposite parts of the Great Rhythm. Each knows of the other's existence, but they keep to their separate spheres, meeting only in the early hours of dawn and the late hours of dusk to exchange dominion over the sky. In seasons of warmth, Ardea has a greater reign over the sky, while in seasons of bitter cold, Tyton's power increases.": "随着阿迪雅和泰顿的诞生，世界开始运转。曾经除了荒地什么都没有的地方，随着阿玛兰斯人的到来，土地变得生机勃勃，世界开始了生与死的无尽循环。他们的到来将无形的天空分为白天和黑夜。他们创造了太阳和月亮，从他们在天上的运动中出现的光和暗的连续，告诉所有生命何时行动，何时休息。阿迪雅和泰坦从大节奏的不同部分诞生。每个人都知道对方的存在，但他们保持着各自的领域，只在黎明的早期和黄昏的晚期相遇，交换对天空的统治权。在温暖的季节，阿迪亚对天空有更大的统治权，而在严寒的季节，泰坦的力量会增加。",
	"The two Amaranthine created much of the life in Humblewood. Ardea suffused the days with sun-loving flowers, plants, and animals, while Tyton baptized the night with insects and animals that embrace the dark. They birthed sentient races, and from them originate all birdfolk, the first of their children, followed shortly after by the humblefolk.": "两位阿玛兰特人创造了汉伯伍德的大部分生活。阿迪雅用喜欢阳光的花草和动物充实了白天，而泰顿则用拥抱黑暗的昆虫和动物洗礼了夜晚。他们孕育了有知觉的种族，所有的鸟人都是从他们那里起源的，他们的第一个孩子，不久之后就是谦卑人。",
	"Originally, all birdfolk were the same. It was difficult to distinguish them from the birds of the forest, as they even possessed the ability to fly. One day, the entire flock of birdfolk decided on a grand contest of gift-giving, to prove which of them was the most worthy to lead. Ardea agreed to act as judge; whoever could present her with the greatest gift would become leaders among her children. For an entire season, birdfolk searched and scrounged, gathered and hunted, returning with trinkets, baubles, gifts great and small. Though Ardea commended all her children for their gifts, only five were truly deserving of her boon.": "本来，所有的鸟人都是一样的。很难将他们与森林中的鸟类区分开来，因为他们甚至拥有飞行的能力。有一天，整个鸟人群体决定进行一场盛大的送礼比赛，以证明他们中谁最有资格领导。阿迪雅同意担任裁判；谁能给她送上最大的礼物，谁就能成为她孩子中的领袖。在一整个季节里，鸟民们寻找和搜刮，收集和猎取，带着小饰品、小玩意、大小礼物回来。虽然阿迪雅赞扬了她所有孩子的礼物，但只有五个孩子真正值得她的恩赐。",
	"Gesme, Reya, Hanera, Altus, and Clhuran: these five became leaders of the birdfolk. They inspired tales, devotion, and gave the birdfolk races their distinct forms and skills. These great ones went on to become part of the Great Rhythm as keepers of nature's balance and protectors of birdfolk across Everden, eventually ascending and joining the Amaranthine. The followers of each of the five were granted new forms and great gifts, to match their leader's exploits. Yet, to accept these gifts, something needed to be lost. This is why the birdfolk of today can only glide: their gift of flight was taken as the price for becoming something new.": "Gesme、Reya、Hanera、Altus和Clhuran：这五个人成为鸟人的领袖。他们激发了故事、奉献精神，并赋予鸟人种族以独特的形式和技能。这些伟大的人继续成为大节奏的一部分，作为自然平衡的守护者和整个Everden的鸟人的保护者，最终上升并加入Amaranthine。五个人的追随者都被赋予了新的形式和伟大的礼物，以配合他们领袖的功绩。然而，要接受这些礼物，需要失去一些东西。这就是为什么今天的鸟人只能滑翔：他们的飞行天赋被当作成为新事物的代价。",
	"The first to present Ardea with a worthy gift was Gesme, a clever birdfolk who saw potential in the world that her kin could scarcely imagine. She had observed the great orb of fire that Ardea had placed high in the sky, and how Ardea had positioned it a great distance from the land and its creatures, so it would warm them gently without burning them. But Gesme also saw that the sun vanished with the coming of night, when the creatures of the dark began to prowl, and thought: \"How remarkable would it be to have some of that fire in the world?\"": "第一个给阿迪雅送上一份有价值的礼物的是Gesme，她是一个聪明的鸟人，在这个世界上看到了她的亲属几乎无法想象的潜力。她观察到阿迪雅在高空放置的巨大火球，以及阿迪雅如何将它安置在离土地和生物很远的地方，这样它就能温和地温暖它们，而不会烧毁它们。但Gesme也看到，当黑暗中的生物开始游荡时，太阳随着黑夜的到来而消失了，他想。\"如果世界上有一些这样的火，那将是多么了不起啊！\"",
	"Other birdfolk laughed at Gesme as she spent days plotting, and reading the sky. She examined every tree, from the great ash to the supple willow. Each day she carried a new branch in her beak, dropping many in frustration. The birdfolk were puzzled, but dismissed her actions. Then, one day at dawn, when the sun was at its lowest point in the sky, Gesme appeared with an oak branch in her beak. Without a word, she took off straight into the horizon. She flew for what seemed like ages, but the oak branch was light and did not trouble her. As she neared the sun her feathers, talons, and beak began to blacken in the heat. Still, she persisted. The oak was hardy and spry, and did not wither. Finally, she stuck the tip of the branch into the sun, igniting it. Hastily she flew back toward the ground, with the branch burning bright in her talons. The oak was patient, and did not burn up, keeping the flame steady as Gesme returned from the sky.": "其他鸟人嘲笑Gesme，因为她花了好几天时间来策划，并阅读天空。她检查每一棵树，从大白蜡到柔软的柳树。每天她都用嘴叼着一根新的树枝，沮丧地扔下许多树枝。鸟人不解，但对她的行为不以为然。然后，有一天黎明时分，当太阳在天空中处于最低点时，Gesme出现了，嘴里叼着一根橡树枝。她一言不发，直接飞向地平线。她似乎飞了很久，但橡树枝很轻，并没有给她带来麻烦。当她接近太阳时，她的羽毛、爪子和喙开始在高温下变黑。不过，她还是坚持了下来。橡树很坚韧，很有活力，没有枯萎。最后，她把树枝的顶端伸进太阳，点燃了它。她急忙向地面飞去，树枝在她的爪子里燃烧着。橡树很有耐心，没有被烧毁，当Gesme从天上回来时，它保持了火焰的稳定。",
	"\"See what I have brought here!\" she bragged, as the astounded birdfolk looked upon her scorched feathers. \"This will keep us warm on the cold days of winter, and safe through the long nights!\"": "\"看看我带来了什么！\"她吹嘘道，因为那些惊愕的鸟人看着她烧焦的羽毛。\"这将使我们在寒冷的冬日里保持温暖，并安全度过漫长的夜晚！\"",
	"Ardea was at first concerned at the presence of fire in the world, for she knew the forests could burn, and that misuse of the fire would bring harm to Everden. But, when she saw the birdfolk gather around the fires, and felt the gentle warmth a small flame could provide to her children, she was overcome with happiness.": "Ardea起初对世界上出现的火感到担忧，因为她知道森林会燃烧，而且滥用火会给Everden带来伤害。但是，当她看到鸟人聚集在火堆周围，感受到小火苗能给她的孩子们带来的温和温暖时，她被幸福所征服。",
	"\"This,\" she declared, \"is worthy of a boon.\"": "\"这，\"她宣称，\"是值得夸奖的。\"",
	"And thus was Gesme changed. Set ablaze with the flames of knowledge and creativity, she became an Amaranthine. The forms of her followers changed too, and they became the first corvums. They were gifted with a bit of her cleverness and foresight, but Ardea gave them all black talons, feathers, and beaks as a reminder of the price Gesme paid to bring fire into the world.": "因此，Gesme被改变了。她被知识和创造力的火焰点燃了，成为了一名阿马兰斯人。她的追随者们的形态也发生了变化，他们成为第一批科沃姆人。他们被赋予了她的聪明才智和远见卓识，但阿迪亚给了他们所有的黑色爪子、羽毛和喙，以提醒他们格斯梅为将火种带入世界而付出的代价。",
	"The second to present a worthy gift was Reya, whose hunting skills were second to none. Though she was small, she was nimble, swift, and wise in the ways of the forest. Reya was capable and reliable, but birdfolk deemed her too independent to be a leader. She would travel the length and breadth of the land on her hunts, sometimes not returning for weeks at a time.": "第二个送出有价值的礼物的是雷亚，她的狩猎技能首屈一指。虽然她个子不高，但她灵活、敏捷，而且对森林的方式很有见地。雷亚有能力，也很可靠，但鸟人认为她太独立了，不能成为一个领导者。她在打猎的时候会走遍整个大地，有时一连几个星期都不回来。",
	"During one of her journeys Reya encountered a stranger. The traveler's true form was hidden under a cloak, but they could fly and clearly felt as comfortable in the trees as any birdfolk. They had heard of Reya's skill in racing, hunting, and navigating the forest, and proposed three challenges, to which Reya agreed.": "在她的一次旅行中，雷亚遇到了一个陌生人。这个旅行者的真实形态隐藏在斗篷下，但他们可以飞行，显然在树上的感觉和任何鸟人一样舒适。他们听说了雷亚在赛车、狩猎和在森林中导航方面的技能，并提出了三个挑战，雷亚同意了。",
	"For the first event, the pair moved to a patch of open sky overlooking rugged plains. There was a rocky outcropping in the distance; whoever flew there first would be the winner. The race began, and Reya immediately fell behind, the cloaked figure moving faster than Reya had ever seen.": "在第一场比赛中，两人来到一片开阔的天空，俯瞰崎岖的平原。远处有一块岩石；谁先飞到那里，谁就是赢家。比赛开始了，雷亚立即落在了后面，那个隐身的身影比雷亚见过的任何时候都要快。",
	"Reya summoned all her strength to keep up, beating her wings like never before. Yet the traveler kept inching forward, and she was unable to close the gap in time.": "雷亚鼓起全部力量跟上，以前所未有的方式拍打翅膀。然而，旅行者不断向前推进，而她无法及时缩小差距。",
	"Reya steeled herself for the next challenge. They flew to the meadows, where small creatures grazed, and it was decided that the first to catch five hares would be the winner. Reya moved with purpose, confident no one could best her skills with a bow, a tool of her own creation. Each of her shots found its mark, until she had but a single hare left to catch. But when Reya looked over at the traveler, she was shocked to see them waiting impatiently with a full complement.": "雷亚为下一个挑战做好了准备。他们飞到草地上，那里有小动物在吃草，决定谁先抓到五只野兔谁就是赢家。雷亚带着目的前进，她相信没有人能够胜过她的弓箭技术，这是她自己创造的工具。她的每一次射击都找到了目标，直到她只剩下一只野兔可以捕捉。但当雷亚看向旅行者时，她震惊地看到他们带着满满的装备不耐烦地等待。",
	"For the third and final event, the pair flew to the center of the forest. The first to emerge into the open fields beyond would be the victor. These were forests Reya knew well, and she was certain she would win. As soon as they had started though, Reya saw the traveler alight, darting through the trees as if weightless. Reya kept pace, using every trick she could to give herself an advantage. Still the traveler pulled ahead, if only by inches, and emerged victorious.": "在第三个也是最后一个项目中，两人飞到了森林的中心。第一个出现在外面的空地上的人将是胜利者。这些是雷亚熟悉的森林，她确信她会赢。然而，他们刚一开始，雷亚就看到旅行者下了车，像失重一样飞快地穿过树林。雷亚紧跟其后，用尽一切办法使自己获得优势。但旅行者仍然领先，即使只是几英寸，并取得了胜利。",
	"Reya landed on a nearby branch and cursed her lack of skill. After a moment of pause however, she regained her composure, and thanked her competitor. Yet the traveler laughed, a sound so familiar, Reya wondered why she hadn't noticed before.": "雷亚落在附近的一根树枝上，诅咒自己缺乏技巧。然而，在停顿了一会儿后，她恢复了平静，并感谢她的竞争者。然而，那个旅行者笑了，这个声音如此熟悉，雷亚想知道为什么她以前没有注意到。",
	"\"You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.\" The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.": "\"你没有什么可羞愧的，鸟人。我看到你的技能是真的。你是第一个在每项赛事中都如此接近我的人，而这并不容易。\" 旅行者脱下他们的斗篷，雷亚不敢相信自己的眼睛。她受到了风本身的挑战。",
	"It swirled, spinning a cloak out of the very clouds, which it placed around Reya. \"Consider this a gift, for providing me with such sport.\" Reya thanked the wind, and with that, it departed, caressing Reya's feathers in a familiar breeze.": "它旋转着，从云层中旋转出一件斗篷，放在雷亚身边。\"把这个当作礼物吧，为我提供这样的运动。\" 雷亚感谢了风，然后它离开了，在熟悉的微风中抚摸着雷亚的羽毛。",
	"When the time came to present a gift, Reya offered Ardea her cloak of clouds, along with the story of her adventure. As Reya told her tale, Ardea could see the eyes of the other birdfolk light up with excitement. When Reya had finished, Ardea returned Reya's cloak to her, saying the story of her adventure was the rarer gift. Reya was changed, and became the Amaranthine of wind, archery, and exploration. Those she inspired became the first raptors. They began to take on a nomadic lifestyle, finding their fortune day by day as Reya once did and told tales of their own adventures by the light of the campfire.": "当赠送礼物的时候，雷亚把她的云朵斗篷和她的冒险故事一起送给了阿迪尔。当雷亚讲述她的故事时，阿迪雅可以看到其他鸟人的眼睛因兴奋而亮了起来。当雷亚讲完后，阿迪雅把雷亚的斗篷还给了她，说她的冒险故事是更稀有的礼物。雷亚被改变了，成为了风、射箭和探索的阿玛兰蒂恩。她所激励的人成为第一批猛禽。他们开始采取游牧的生活方式，像雷亚曾经做的那样，一天天地寻找自己的财富，并在篝火的光芒下讲述自己的冒险故事。",
	"The third to present a precious gift was Hanera, a gentle birdfolk and the first to shift her focus away from the sky. Rather than live in the trees with other birdfolk, Hanera made a home for herself below the canopy. She cared for the soil and the earth, and in return the earth gifted her with wisdom. From the earth, Hanera learned to speak with plants—knowledge she used to better care for them. She soon earned fame among the birdfolk, as one who grew the largest and best-tasting crops.": "第三个送上珍贵礼物的是哈内拉，她是一个温柔的鸟人，也是第一个将注意力从天空转移的人。哈内拉没有和其他鸟人一起生活在树上，而是在树冠下为自己建了一个家。她关心土壤和大地，作为回报，大地给了她智慧。从大地那里，哈内拉学会了与植物对话--她用这些知识来更好地照顾它们。她很快就在鸟人中赢得了名声，因为她种出了最大、最美味的作物。",
	"\"These crops,\" Hanera thought, \"are the finest gift I could offer to our Mother.\" And so she set about planting a large garden, its bounty reserved for Ardea.": "\"这些作物，\"哈内拉想，\"是我能提供给我们母亲的最好礼物。\" 于是，她开始种植一个大花园，把它的丰收留给阿迪雅。",
	"One day, while tending to her garden, Hanera saw a family of haggard travelers making their way out of the woods. When they saw Hanera, the mother begged her for aid.": "有一天，哈内拉在照料她的花园时，看到一家憔悴的旅行者正从树林里走出来。当他们看到哈内拉时，母亲向她乞求援助。",
	"\"Please, kind sister, we are in great need. We were traveling through the forest when a creature attacked me and wounded my wing. We escaped, but I cannot fly. Please, help us, we are terribly hungry.\"": "\"拜托，好心的姐姐，我们非常需要。我们在森林中旅行时，一个生物袭击了我，伤了我的翅膀。我们逃脱了，但我不能飞。请帮助我们，我们非常饥饿。\"",
	"Hanera knew that she couldn't feed herself and this family while storing crops for Ardea. Even still, she could not turn them away in their desperate state. She offered to share her home and her food for as long as the travelers needed, making sure their needs were met before saving any food for Ardea.": "哈内拉知道，她无法在为阿迪亚储存农作物的同时养活自己和这个家庭。即使如此，她也不能在他们绝望的情况下拒绝他们。她提出，只要旅行者需要，她就与他们分享她的家和她的食物，确保他们的需求得到满足，然后再为阿迪雅保存任何食物。",
	"The travelers stayed with Hanera for many nights while the mother healed. Each day, Hanera would prepare the family meals, telling the plants of their plight. The plants understood, and were honored to nourish the weary and wounded birdfolk. In return, Hanera ensured their seeds were saved and planted again, so their lives would continue indefinitely.": "在母亲痊愈期间，旅行者在哈内拉家住了很多个夜晚。每天，哈内拉都会为家人准备饭菜，告诉植物们他们的困境。植物们明白了，并且很荣幸地滋养了疲惫和受伤的鸟人。作为回报，哈内拉确保它们的种子被保存并再次种植，因此它们的生命将无限期地延续下去。",
	"At night, Hanera applied medicine to the mother's wound made from the leaves of kindly herbs. By the end of the season the mother had healed, the family was in good health, and they gratefully flew away.": "晚上，哈内拉用善良的草药叶子给母亲的伤口上药。在这个季节结束时，母亲已经痊愈，一家人都很健康，他们感激地飞走了。",
	"When the day finally came for birdfolk to present their gifts, all Hanera could offer Ardea was a few fruits and vegetables. She wove them together along with flowers she had grown, attempting to make her offering look more cheerful.": "当鸟人赠送礼物的日子终于到来时，哈内拉能提供给阿迪雅的只有一些水果和蔬菜。她把这些东西和她种的花编织在一起，试图让她的礼物看起来更欢快。",
	"\"I'm sorry, Mother Stork,\" Hanera said. \"I had meant to present you with a great harvest, but this is all I could provide.\"": "\"我很抱歉，鹳妈妈，\"哈内拉说。\"我本想给你带来巨大的收获，但这是我能提供的全部。\"",
	"Ardea took the wreath, and spoke gladly: \"You have given me more than enough, for you see my child, I received your compassion for an entire season.\" As Ardea spoke, celestial messengers appeared by her side, and together they transformed into the birdfolk family Hanera had so tenderly cared for.": "阿迪雅接过花环，高兴地说道：\"你给我的已经够多了，因为你看我的孩子，我接受了你一整个季节的怜悯。\" 当阿迪雅说话时，天体的使者出现在她身边，他们一起变成了哈内拉如此温柔地照顾过的鸟人家庭。",
	"For her charity, Hanera received the Amaranthine's boon: her feathers turned green and grew into vines and shoots, adorned with the most beautiful flowers. Other birdfolk stared in awe, and those who followed Hanera became the first gallus, blessed with her inspiring kindness, as well as her closeness with the earth and all growing things.": "因为她的慈善，哈内拉得到了阿马兰斯的恩惠：她的羽毛变成了绿色，长成了藤蔓和嫩芽，上面点缀着最美丽的花朵。其他鸟人敬畏地注视着，那些追随哈内拉的鸟人成为第一批胆小鬼，受到她鼓舞人心的善意的祝福，以及她与大地和所有生长物的亲密关系。",
	"The fourth to present a commendable gift was Altus, whose hunting skills were second only to Reya's, though Altus journeyed the Wood to test his limits rather than explore as Reya did. Altus felt pure joy when overcoming obstacles. He loved the cold seasons and challenged himself by hunting at night. His nocturnal existence granted Altus a perspective other birdfolk lacked.": "第四位赠送值得称赞的礼物的是阿尔图斯，他的狩猎技能仅次于雷亚，尽管阿尔图斯在森林中旅行是为了测试他的极限，而不是像雷亚那样探索。阿尔图斯在克服障碍时感到纯粹的快乐。他喜欢寒冷的季节，并通过夜间打猎来挑战自己。他的夜行生活赋予了阿尔图斯一种其他鸟人所缺乏的视角。",
	"\"What if I gifted Ardea something she has never seen before?\" he thought. \"Yes! I shall hunt the moon, and present it to her, so that she may see its lovely glow.\" This would be unthinkable to any other birdfolk, but Altus was resolute, confident his gift would please Ardea.": "\"如果我把她从来没有见过的东西送给阿迪雅，会怎么样？\"他想。\"是的！我将猎取月亮，把它送给她，让她看到它可爱的光芒。\" 这对任何其他鸟人来说都是不可想象的，但阿尔图斯很坚决，相信他的礼物会让阿迪雅高兴。",
	"However, he was neither as skilled or nimble as Reya, nor as clever or cunning as Gesme. His arrows would not scratch the moon, and despite his great strength, he could not move it. But Altus was stubborn, for many nights he tried and failed to bring down his quarry. The more he tried, the more frustrated he became. Altus even thought he could hear the moon's laughter reflected in the babbling brooks and rippling ponds, mocking his futile efforts. Still, Altus remained determined.": "然而，他既不像雷亚那样熟练和灵活，也不像格西姆那样聪明和狡猾。他的箭不会划伤月亮，尽管他有强大的力量，却无法移动它。但阿尔图斯很固执，许多个夜晚他都在尝试，但都没能打倒他的猎物。他越是努力，就越是沮丧。阿尔图斯甚至认为他能听到月亮的笑声映在潺潺的小溪和荡漾的池塘里，嘲笑他徒劳的努力。尽管如此，阿尔特斯仍然坚定不移。",
	"Tyton, intrigued, observed Altus as he struggled. \"Why do you persist in this task, my child?\" the Amaranthine of night asked. \"You must know you will not succeed.\"": "泰顿很感兴趣，在阿尔图斯挣扎时观察他。\"你为什么坚持这项任务，我的孩子？\"黑夜中的阿玛兰蒂恩问。\"你一定知道你不会成功。\"",
	"Altus replied, \"If I did not try, then I would never know for certain if I could. But you may be right. For all my strength, I can never best the moon, and only a fool refuses to acknowledge when he has been bested.\" Altus paused, letting out a sigh. \"Pity, it would have made a lovely gift for Ardea.\"": "阿尔图斯回答说：\"如果我不尝试，那么我就永远无法确定我是否能做到。但你可能是对的。以我所有的力量，我永远无法战胜月亮，只有傻瓜才会拒绝承认他被战胜了。\" 阿尔图斯停顿了一下，发出一声叹息。\"可惜了，这本可以成为送给阿迪雅的一份可爱的礼物。\"",
	"Tyton was touched, not just by the sentiment but by the incredible will of this birdfolk.": "泰顿被感动了，不仅仅是被这种情感所感动，也被这个鸟人的惊人意志所感动。",
	"\"Your resolve does you credit\" Tyton said. \"To capture the moon, you will require this.\" He said producing a lidded chalice, intricately carved from the wood of an alder tree. Tyton gave it to Altus, then the Amaranthine of night disappeared.": "\"你的决心为你赢得了荣誉。\"泰顿说。\"要捕获月亮，你需要这个。\" 他说着拿出一个有盖的圣杯，是用赤杨树的木头复杂地雕刻而成的。泰顿把它交给了阿尔图斯，然后黑夜中的阿马兰蒂恩消失了。",
	"Altus was puzzled, until the moon appeared from behind a cloud. He heard its laughter in the pond behind him. When he turned, he saw it: the moon's reflection set perfectly in the still, clear waters. Without delay, Altus filled the chalice with water. With the moon clearly reflected within the chalice, he quickly shut the lid. The moon was caught.": "阿尔图斯很疑惑，直到月亮从云层后面出现。他在身后的池塘里听到了它的笑声。当他转身时，他看到了：月亮的倒影完美地镶嵌在静止、清澈的水中。阿尔图斯毫不迟疑地将水注入了圣杯。月亮清晰地倒映在圣杯中，他迅速关上杯盖。月亮被抓住了。",
	"As dawn began to break over the horizon, Tyton appeared once again before Altus, \"Let my sister gaze upon my creation, but return it by day's end. The night has need of it,\" old Father Owl said, before departing for the lands beyond life.": "当黎明开始在地平线上破晓时，泰顿再次出现在阿尔图斯面前。\"让我的妹妹注视我的创造，但在白天结束前把它归还。夜晚需要它。\"老猫头鹰神父说，然后就离开了，前往生命之外的土地。",
	"And so it was that Altus presented Ardea with the moon. He became the first strig, and his people were gifted with his great strength and indomitable will. He kept his oath to Tyton, returning the moon that very evening. For this, Tyton gifted all strigs with the ability to see clearly under its light. Tyton welcomed Altus as a guest in his home, deep within the lands of death. Altus found the cold there bracing, and decided to share it with the people of Everden. This is why the weather is so inclement in winter; Altus returns each year, carrying storms of sleet and snow in his chalice, to test the birdfolk's endurance.": "就这样，阿尔图斯把月亮送给了阿尔迪亚。他成了第一个斯特里格人，他的人民得到了他强大的力量和不屈不挠的意志的恩赐。他遵守了对泰顿的誓言，当晚就把月亮还给了他。为此，泰顿赐予所有斯特里格人在月光下看得清楚的能力。泰顿欢迎阿尔图斯到他家做客，他家在死亡之地的深处。阿尔图斯发现那里的寒冷让人振奋，于是决定与埃弗登的人们分享它。这就是为什么冬天的天气如此恶劣；阿尔图斯每年都会回来，在他的酒杯里装着暴风雪，以测试鸟人的耐力。",
	"The last to present a worthy gift was Clhuran, who seemed an odd choice for a leader. Clhuran had no desire to lead.": "最后送上一份有价值的礼物的是克赫兰，他似乎是一个奇怪的领袖人选。克赫兰没有领导的欲望。",
	"He was whimsical and impulsive. He had wild moods, and was never able to focus on one task for too long. He also had incredible luck. Most saw him as little more than a bumbler, someone who floated their way through life. In truth, Clhuran was full of mirth and cunning. \"Where I am,\" he oft remarked, \"is simply where I am meant to be. I follow the flow of the universe.\"": "他异想天开，容易冲动。他有狂野的情绪，而且永远无法在一项任务上专注太久。他也有难以置信的运气。大多数人认为他不过是个混混，一个在生活中漂浮不定的人。事实上，克胡兰充满了欢笑和狡猾。\"他经常说：\"我所在的地方，只是我注定要去的地方。我跟随宇宙的流动。\"",
	"For all his mirth, Clhuran was notoriously fickle; he was a trickster, who delighted in humbling birdfolk who boasted about their cleverness. This earned him many admirers, and just as many enemies.": "克赫兰虽然爱笑，但却出了名的善变；他是个诡计多端的人，喜欢羞辱那些夸耀自己聪明的鸟人。这为他赢得了许多崇拜者，也赢得了同样多的敌人。",
	"Clhuran never intended to compete in the gift-giving contest.": "克赫兰从未想过要参加送礼比赛。",
	"\"What should I care what others think of me,\" he harrumphed, \"So long as I am happy?\" Some birdfolk, bitter at having been fooled by him, claimed Clhuran could never hope to win such a contest. Clhuran tried to pay them no heed, in his heart he felt the barbs hit their mark.": "\"我应该关心别人对我的看法，\"他哈哈大笑，\"只要我快乐就好。\" 一些鸟人因为被他愚弄而感到痛苦，声称克赫兰不可能希望赢得这样一场比赛。克赫兰试图不理会他们，在他的心里，他觉得这些刺耳的声音击中了他的目标。",
	"\"Who am I kidding,\" Clhuran sighed. \"I am not strong, nor smart, nor skilled, nor leaderly... I couldn't possibly produce a gift worthy of Ardea.\" With this last thought he sank into a bitter melancholy.": "\"我在骗谁呢？\"克赫兰叹了口气。\"我不强壮，也不聪明，没有技能，也没有领导能力......。我不可能创造出配得上Ardea的礼物。\" 带着这最后一个想法，他陷入了痛苦的忧郁之中。",
	"It was only when a young boy approached him that he regained his confidence. \"Please Clhuran, won't you show us what you can do?\" the small birdfolk said. \"Many of us love your tricks, and your jokes. You bring joy to all birdfolk! Surely if you try you can do it!\"": "只有当一个小男孩走近他时，他才恢复了信心。\"请问克胡兰，你不给我们看看你的本事吗？\"小鸟人说。\"我们很多人都喜欢你的把戏，还有你的笑话。你给所有鸟人带来了欢乐！\"。当然，如果你尝试，你可以做到！\"",
	"Clhuran saw the sincerity in the boy's eyes, and suddenly he knew what to do. \"Fine, fine,\" he exclaimed in mock annoyance. \"I suppose I shall entertain you.\"": "克赫兰看到男孩眼中的真诚，突然间他知道该怎么做。\"好吧，好吧，\"他假装恼怒地喊道。\"我想我应该招待你。\"",
	"With newfound confidence, he approached Ardea. All of the birdfolk were gathered, and when Clhuran looked upon the crowd he saw both enemies and friends. Thoughts of those friendships allowed Clhuran to reach deep within himself, and from the depths of his soul he felt a beat, like the Great Rhythm itself. Channeling this energy, Clhuran opened his beak and brought forth a most beautiful gift: a song.": "带着新的信心，他走近阿迪亚。所有的鸟人都聚集在一起，当Clhuran看着这群人时，他看到了敌人和朋友。对这些友谊的思考让克赫兰触及到了自己的内心深处，从他的灵魂深处，他感受到了一种节拍，就像伟大的节奏本身。利用这种能量，Clhuran张开嘴，带来了一份最美丽的礼物：一首歌。",
	"It was a song so perfect, so harmonious, that no birdfolk could deny its charm. Ardea beamed. \"My child, you have within you a rare gift. May all of your kin be blessed by it.\" With those words, Clhuran became the first luma, the Amaranthine of all fortune, good or ill. His peculiar connection to fate is shared by all his kin.": "这是一首如此完美、如此和谐的歌曲，没有鸟人可以否认它的魅力。阿迪雅笑了。\"我的孩子，你有一个罕见的天赋。愿你所有的亲属都能得到它的祝福。\" 有了这些话，克胡兰就成了第一个卢马，所有命运的阿玛兰斯因，无论好坏。他与命运的特殊联系为他所有的亲属所共享。",
	"Ever since Clhuran's performance all birds sing, hoping that they might imitate the perfect song he sang to Ardea. While some sing pleasantly, Clhuran made it so those who mocked him can only trill, shriek, or caw artlessly. This is why it is always important to show respect for others, no matter how odd they may seem.": "自从Clhuran的表演之后，所有的鸟儿都在唱歌，希望它们能模仿他唱给Ardea的完美歌曲。虽然有些人唱得很悦耳，但克赫兰让那些嘲笑他的人只能颤抖、尖叫或毫无艺术性地叫喊。这就是为什么对他人表示尊重总是很重要的原因，无论他们看起来多么古怪。",
	"\"O, seeing stars, hear my words and part the veil of night, Gift me thoughts of strategy, bless me with your sight. If this trial I do survive, with plans and actions shrewd, I pledge undying loyalty, for wisdom you imbued.\"": "\"哦，看到的星星，听到我的话语，拨开黑夜的面纱，赐予我策略的思想，用你的视力保佑我。如果我在这场考验中幸存下来，有了精明的计划和行动，我保证对你的忠心不渝，因为智慧是你赋予的。\"",

	"Humblewood is a great and ancient land covered by a vast temperate forest. In some places, this forest is so old the trees dwarf even the tallest castles. In other places, smaller trees provide food and shelter for the fauna and folk of the Wood. Humblewood is named after the forest, but beyond the trees exist the towering range of The Crest mountains, the low-lying swamplands of the Mokk Fields, and the rocky shores of the Talongrip Coast.": "汉伯伍德是一片伟大而古老的土地，被广阔的温带森林覆盖。在一些地方，这片森林是如此古老，树木甚至使最高的城堡都相形见绌。在其他地方，较小的树木为森林里的动物和居民提供食物和庇护。汉伯伍德是以森林命名的，但在树木之外，还有高耸的山峰，低洼的莫克场沼泽地，以及塔隆里普海岸的岩石海岸。",

	"Long ago, druids of the Wood learned how to speak with trees and use magic to shape them into shelters in which they could make their homes. This process was considered deeply respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape it didn't agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as shapers, became mediators between the will of the people and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood—Alderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart's branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart became Humblewood's capital. Known throughout the region as the \"Great Tree City,\" Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional and some from the farthest corners of Everden.": "很久以前，伍德的德鲁伊们学会了如何与树木对话，并使用魔法将它们塑造成可以安家的住所。这个过程被认为是非常尊重的，因为不能强迫树木采取它不同意的任何形状。因此，被称为塑造者的专业德鲁伊成为人们的意愿和森林的意愿之间的调解人。鸟人塑造者与森林中最高、最古老的树--桤木心对话。塑造者们获得许可，让鸟人在Alderheart的树枝上建造一个家。后来，这棵大树又允许把它的树干塑造成越来越多的人的家园。这座新兴的城市以这棵树的名字命名，这棵树如此慷慨地为森林里的人们提供了一个家，阿尔德心成为汉伯伍德的首都。在整个地区被称为 \"伟大的树城\"，Alderheart是一个充满活力的地方和文化中心，是成千上万居民的家，有些是地区性的，有些来自Everden的最远的角落。",
	"Alderheart is home to every race of birdfolk and humblefolk. The thriving community attracts people from faraway lands, like traveling merchants, explorers, and foreign dignitaries. Citizens of the Humblewood who don't live in the city routinely journey there to trade goods, stock up on supplies, engage in artistic endeavors, or simply to catch up on the latest news and gossip. Effectively everyone in Humblewood is connected to Alderheart.": "阿尔德心是每一个鸟人和卑微人种族的家园。这个繁荣的社区吸引着来自远方的人们，如旅行商人、探险家和外国政要。不住在城市里的拙政园公民经常去那里交易货物，储备物资，从事艺术工作，或者只是为了了解最新的新闻和八卦。实际上，汉伯伍德的每个人都与阿尔德心有联系。",
	"Virtually anything can be found in Alderheart, if you know where to look. The majority of the city's inhabitants are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark alleys and back rooms. Crime here is usually kept in check by the Perch Guard, but while the city guards are vaunted as being among the best in the Wood, illicit activities continue under the cover of darkness.": "几乎任何东西都可以在Alderheart找到，只要你知道去哪里找。这个城市的大多数居民都是善意的、正派的人，但像任何城市一样，也有黑暗的小巷和密室。这里的犯罪通常由珀奇卫队控制，但虽然城市卫队被吹嘘为森林中最好的卫队之一，但非法活动在黑暗的掩护下仍在继续。",
	"As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.": "由于Alderheart非常庞大，游客往往很难说他们是在一棵树上。伟大的树城分为三个主要层次，人们在这里生活、工作和进行他们的生活：树冠、树干和根部。",
	"The canopy contains Alderheart's most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.": "天幕包含了阿尔德心最有代表性的建筑，包括鸟人议会的会议厅，鲈鱼卫队的总部，以及森林中最大的市场。这个市场拥有精品店，顾客可以在这里找到高品质的武器、盔甲和冒险装备、最新的时装、最好的食物，以及从整个埃弗顿带来的商品。在主市场外，一些小商店则在小路之外兜售商品。虽然任何阿尔德心的社会名流都会建议你去那些更有名望的商店，但有些商店里的商品还是很便宜的。",
	"City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are moni-tored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy. \"Branchroads\", specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding platforms provide birdfolk, at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps. Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital becomes increasingly dangerous.": "位于树冠周围战略要点的城市大门，是进入城市的唯一认可方式，并由栖息地守卫哨所监控。这些城门与树的低层和森林地面相连，有大型蜿蜒的楼梯，可以步行。庞大的交通基础设施在树冠上很常见。\"支路\"，特殊形状的木制小路，是阿尔德心的贸易动脉。与绳索桥一起，这些道路允许快递员使用手推车将货物从一个地方运到另一个地方。连接到可升降平台的滑轮被用来将货物从森林地面上抬起。在最外围的树枝上，这些基础设施无法得到支持，滑翔平台至少为鸟人提供了一种穿越其他无法通行的缝隙的手段。如果没有滑翔的能力，在首都的这部分地区航行变得越来越危险。",
	"Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are stationed atop reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impres-sive homes are located in the Boughs District, just above the market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood and have a more modest feel to them.": "天幕中的建筑物由各种材料制成，包括石头、木材和砖。大多数都驻扎在加固的平台上，以保持其稳定性。更有价值的房屋位于枝桠区，就在市场的上方。那些在外围的树枝上的房子往往是由木头制成的，给人的感觉更加朴实。",
	"The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is stable floor beneath them.": "大都市最大的部分，即主干，它是繁荣的天幕和不太富裕的根部之间的一个中间地带。许多卑微的人在这里安家，因为他们下面有稳定的地板。",
	"The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers. Pathways split and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.": "对于新的旅行者来说，树干可能是阿尔德心最令人困惑和迷失方向的地方之一。小路分分合合，有时会渐渐消失得无影无踪。专门设计的冷灯笼系统作为主要路径的路标。这些灯笼使用捕获的萤火虫或魔法微粒来提供照明，这取决于附近的情况。在这两种情况下，点灯人的任务是确保它们在白天保持照明，以提供一个日/夜循环。",
	"In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart's wood. They showcase unique wares and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is home to inns, taverns, and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train new recruits to their order.": "在树干上，另一个市场也在蓬勃发展。在这里，各种类型的摊位都围绕着用阿尔德心的木头做成的中央支撑柱。它们展示着独特的商品和小众的民间风格的食品和文化产品，这在天幕市场是找不到的。也有一些好奇心强的商店和地区商品的卖家，如从年轻的罗勒鱼背上采摘的水晶。此外，树干市场是旅店、酒馆和公共房屋的所在地。对于那些想要节省钱财的人来说，这里是在阿尔德心找到可用商品和冒险装备的最好地方。在市场附近有一个德鲁伊的苔藓和真菌树林，由Tenders支持，他们帮助照顾树并训练新的新人加入他们的秩序。",
	"Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk market, the central support pillars contain tenement style housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out of the trunk, for Alderheart's traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since Alderheart was first shaped.": "除了树干市场上的许多商店和商品外，中央的支撑柱包含了为最国际化的树干居民提供的唐人街式住房。在这里也可以找到更多富裕的房屋，这些房屋是由树干塑造出来的，是为阿尔德心的传统思想的卑微的贵族以及鸟人贵族准备的，自从阿尔德心第一次被塑造出来，他们的家就在这里。",
	"Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind, illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood, most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that many cannot afford.": "过了树干市场，小路变宽，蜿蜒曲折，被树上的洞口照亮，阳光可以透进里面。尽管在这些明亮的空地上，有些房屋建在靠近树皮的地方，那里的窗户可以从木头上塑造出来，但大多数房屋都是在昏暗的小路上塑造的。少数人获得许可，在树干的外表面塑造房屋。这些特殊的房屋通过精心围起来的道路与内部通道相连，被认为是许多人买不起的奢侈品。",
	"The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are constantly on the lookout for smugglers.": "在树干上走得越远，住宅和基础设施就越破旧，越不整洁。没有官方授权的途径可以从树干的低处离开或进入树，而栖息地警卫队一直在寻找走私者。",
	"Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping, lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart: the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. These hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn't easy, but people are trying their best to keep their communities strong, as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the roots see it as necessary to survive.": "在树干的最低部分下面，有一系列的隧道被刻在阿尔德心的根部。起初，这些树根并不被认为是城市的正式部分，它们的发展在很大程度上被城市官员忽视了，直到有消息说那里发生了非法活动。许多人相信，如果德鲁伊能治愈这棵树，隧道就会消失，但阿尔德心本身对生活在这里的人很同情，决定允许隧道的存在，而不是强迫人们离开他们的家园。此后，根部隧道经过德鲁伊的塑造得到了加强，升至与树干内部相当，并在附近驻扎了一支鲈鱼卫队的驻军。即使有了这些改进，树根仍然是阿尔德心最贫穷的地区：大树城的贫民窟。在这里，空气总是阴暗潮湿，野生真菌肆意生长。建筑物大多是用捡来的材料拼凑起来的，有些已经被改造成了社区聚会场所。这些中心在主干区的帮助下帮助连接根部的社区，并允许这里的人们组织和计划邻里活动。根部地区的生活并不容易，但人们正在尽力保持他们的社区强大，因为他们为更好的生活条件向天幕请愿。这里的商店很少，一般都是贩卖走私和偷来的货物。犯罪是无处不在的；许多居住在树根的人认为这是生存所必需的。",

It is dangerous living so close to the Grove, but the rewards make it worth the risk for the intrepid folk that call Ashbarrow home. The town takes its name from the small hill upon which it rests, and is inhabited by a mix of birdfolk and humblefolk who shelter within its low stone walls. A large watchtower near the town's center serves as both a means of observing when the winds will bring ash from the Scorched Grove, as well as an observatory for seers who watch the stars for signs and portents.": "这个小镇位于焦土森林的边缘，风吹过的灰烬使土壤变得肥沃，土地上有丰富的野味。住在离丛林这么近的地方是很危险的，但对于把阿什巴罗当作家的无畏的人们来说，回报是值得冒险的。小镇的名字来自于它所处的小山丘，居住着一些鸟人和卑微的人，他们在低矮的石墙内避难。镇中心附近有一座大型瞭望塔，它既是观察风何时会从焦土林带来灰烬的手段，也是观察星星的预言家们的观察所。",

Prospective students are tested for their skills, but also the motivation for their studies. The College takes great care to ensure its members will positively represent the legacy and reputation of the Avium out in the world.": "Avium是一所魔法学院，有广泛的学科可供学习。知识的自由传播是Avium的核心原则之一，但学院仍然对它所保护的一些更危险的魔法书保持一定程度的保密性。Avium的大厅里欢迎所有的种族，尽管只有在校长和高级职员委员会的意愿下才会被录取。未来的学生要接受技能测试，但也要测试他们的学习动机。学院非常谨慎，以确保其成员将积极地代表Avium在世界的遗产和声誉。",
	"The Avium was once a living tree that was home to a perch known for producing some of Humblewood's most legendary scholars. After the tree's death, a group of wizards from this perch decided to found the Avium here. They used transmutation magic to artificially petrify the tree, and then shaped it into a building capable of housing the largest mage college in Humblewood. Controlled by magical fields, the College's many structures float in circuit with one another: a collection of towers, courtyards, and observatories all hover around the huge central building, each equipped with a bridge that lines up with the main building at regular intervals. Those not gifted with the birdfolk's limited form of flight must harness their magic for transportation, or wait until the archways align to allow for foot traffic.": "亚维姆曾经是一棵活生生的树，它是一个以培养汉伯伍德最富传奇色彩的学者而闻名的栖息地。在这棵树死后，一群来自这个栖息地的巫师决定在这里建立阿维姆。他们用转化魔法将这棵树人工石化，然后将其塑造成一座能够容纳汉伯伍德最大的法师学院的建筑。在魔力场的控制下，学院的许多结构都在彼此间循环浮动：一系列的塔楼、庭院和观测站都围绕着巨大的中央建筑盘旋，每个都配备了一座桥，以固定的间隔与主建筑连成一体。那些没有鸟人有限的飞行天赋的人，必须利用他们的魔法进行运输，或者等待拱门对齐，允许行人通行。",
	"While the curriculum is diverse, the College does impose certain limitations, most notably regarding necromancy. As inhabitants of the Wood, the Avium's primary staff members originate from a culture with great respect for nature and the cycle of life. As such, the necromantic arts are taught mainly in a theoretical sense. Practical application of necromancy at the College is highly regulated, and available only under strict guidance.": "虽然课程是多样化的，但学院确实施加了某些限制，最明显的是关于死灵法术。作为森林的居民，Avium的主要工作人员来自一种对自然和生命循环非常尊重的文化。因此，死灵术的教学主要是在理论上进行的。学院对死灵术的实际应用受到高度管制，只有在严格的指导下才能使用。",
	"Students are, however, encouraged to explore other schools of magic to their fullest potential. Breakthroughs in elemental theorems, teleportation methods, and advances in practical transmutation have been pioneered at the Avium. Within these classrooms you will find future Tenders, council members, and protectors of the Wood. The application process is demanding, and the curriculum rigorous. Few make it to graduation. For those who prove their grasp of the arcane, endorsement from the Avium is among the highest of honors.": "然而，学生们被鼓励去探索其他魔法流派的最大潜力。元素定理的突破，传送方法，以及实际转化的进展都是在阿维姆开创的。在这些教室里，你会发现未来的Tender、理事会成员和森林的保护者。申请的过程是苛刻的，课程是严格的。很少有人能顺利毕业。对于那些证明自己掌握了奥秘的人来说，来自奥维姆的认可是最高的荣誉之一。",

It includes a central hub of shops, trade halls, and shipping platforms, all under the watchful eye of the local Perch Guard. Some of the farms have even begun to expand downward, encompassing small horticultural plots at the base of trees. The grounded farms produce luxury goods that can't be grown along the branches, and house corrals for giant insects that produce goods ranging from silk to meat.": "在鸟人栖息地的耕作是非常规的。在较高的栖息地，树枝上长着果实累累的藤蔓和苔藓。最大和最有成效的养殖栖息地是布拉肯米尔（Brackenmill）。由于它靠近地面，被认为是一个较小的栖息地，但布拉克米尔由许多邻近的树木农场组成，经过多年的发展，彼此融合在一起。它包括一个由商店、贸易大厅和运输平台组成的中心枢纽，所有这些都在当地鲈鱼卫队的监视之下。一些农场甚至开始向下扩展，包括在树底的小块园艺地。地面上的农场生产无法在树枝上种植的奢侈品，并为生产从丝绸到肉类的巨大昆虫提供畜栏。",

Stranger still, the soil beneath the ashen steppes still smolders with embers. The air here carries a supernatural heat which can exhaust travelers or even cause burns depending on its fierceness. This hostile landscape is home to a variety of curious fire-aspected creatures. Certain species, now considered native to Humblewood, only appeared after the Great Calamity. Most notable are the emberbats, which roost in the safety of the Grove during the day.": "几个世纪前，被称为焦土森林的地区曾经是一片郁郁葱葱的森林，有平静的草地和宁静的小树林。然后，大灾难来了：一场巨大的森林火灾席卷了整个丛林，使其变成了一片燃烧的灰烬平原。丛林拒绝痊愈。更奇怪的是，灰烬草原下的土壤仍然在燃烧着余烬。这里的空气带着超自然的热量，可以使旅行者筋疲力尽，甚至造成灼伤，这取决于它的激烈程度。这种恶劣的地貌是各种好奇的火象生物的家园。某些物种，现在被认为是汉伯伍德的原生物种，只是在大灾难之后才出现。最值得注意的是琥珀蝙蝠，它们白天在安全的丛林中栖息。",
	"Accounts of the great blaze have been recorded in Humblewood's history books, but the exact cause of the Great Calamity remains a mystery. The soils of the Grove were tested and found to be distinctively suited to channeling evocation energy, especially when used with fire spells.

They believe that through study and communion with nature, the natural balance of the energy in the wood can be restored, healing the Grove back into the tranquil forest it once was.": "灼热丛林由神秘主义者和德鲁伊组成的小团体看管，他们被称为 \"补师\"。许多Tenders都是有天赋的思想家和自然魔法的实践者，他们毕生致力于了解灾难对丛林的影响的本质，并治愈它所造成的损害。他们相信，通过研究和与大自然的交流，可以恢复木材中能量的自然平衡，将丛林恢复到它曾经的宁静森林。",
	"There is much debate about the intent and success of the Tenders. High-society perch-dwellers are inclined to think of the Tenders as nothing more than \"odd-birds,\" embarking on a fool's errand. These detractors claim that the Scorched Grove is simply a quirk of Humblewood's natural magic. Much of the populace agrees with this point of view, despite educated claims to the contrary. Still, given the affinity between nature and the cultures of the Wood, Tenders are generally respected for the care and reverence they give to the forest.": "关于招标会的意图和成功，有很多争论。上流社会的栖息地居民倾向于认为投标人只不过是 \"怪鸟\"，是在做一件愚蠢的事情。这些诋毁者声称，焦土林只是汉伯伍德的自然魔法的一个怪癖。大部分民众同意这一观点，尽管有受过教育的人声称与此相反。尽管如此，考虑到自然和森林文化之间的亲和力，Tenders因其对森林的关怀和敬畏而受到普遍尊重。",

To this end, the perch was hastily constructed within a small stand of willow trees. In contrast to standard perches, a decent portion of the homes and facilities here were built entirely on the ground. This closeness to the earth creates a feeling of unease and general distaste for birdfolk accustomed to the high perches, but the other races that make up the population appreciate the easier access to research stations and support buildings.": "绞刑架是森林中一个相对较新的发展。它最初只是一个小的前哨站，是研究人员和前往莫克领域的粘液探查者的最后一站。当人们开始在沼泽中消失时，人们决定建造一个更永久的定居点，以容纳一小队鲈鱼卫士。为此，在一小片柳树丛中匆匆建造了栖息地。与标准的栖息地相比，这里的房屋和设施有相当一部分是完全建在地上的。这种与大地的亲近让习惯于高处栖息的鸟人感到不安和厌恶，但构成人口的其他种族很欣赏这种更容易进入研究站和支持建筑的方式。",
