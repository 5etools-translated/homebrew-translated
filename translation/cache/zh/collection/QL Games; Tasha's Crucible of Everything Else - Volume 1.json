	"You learn how to create magical effigies. Using any set of artisan's tools of your choice, you can take an action to magically create a Tiny figurine in your hands.

It may be a jade figurine, a sackcloth doll, a clay mock-up, or even spoons in a pickle jar.": "你学会了如何创造神奇的雕像。使用你选择的任何一套工匠工具，你可以采取一个行动，在你手中神奇地创造一个小雕像。这个小雕像可以用一只手拿着，你可以用它作为施法的焦点。当你创造这个雕像时，你决定它的外观。它可以是一个玉石雕像，一个麻布娃娃，一个泥塑，甚至是泡菜坛子里的勺子。",
	"Once you create a magical effigy, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can only have one magical effigy at a time.

The effigy also loses its magic after 1 hour, and you can dismiss its magic early as an action.": "一旦你创造了一个魔法肖像，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个长时间的休息，或者直到你消耗了一个1级或更高级别的法术槽。你一次只能有一个魔法雕像。如果你创造了一个新的，原来的那个就会失去魔力。遗像在1小时后也会失去魔力，而你可以通过行动提前解除它的魔力。",

As an action, you can see through the creature's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses or until the effigy disappears. The creature is aware someone is perceiving through its senses, but does not necessarily know who it is or how they can do it.": "你的雕像造成的伤害卷增加了（%0%）。作为一个行动，你可以通过这个生物的眼睛看到它，听到它所听到的声音，并且持续这样做，直到你使用你的行动来恢复你的正常感官，或者直到这个雕像消失。该生物意识到有人在通过它的感官进行感知，但不一定知道是谁，也不知道他们是如何做到的。",

	"The College of Pantomime is the home of bards who found that the world is a cacophonous place with too much noise and distractions to truly appreciate the Words of Creation or the magic which stemmed from it. They have therefore opted not to add their voices to the multitudes, instead choosing to remain silent, focusing instead on their movements and intentions to weave their magic as they trace the echoes of the Words of Creations which vibrate throughout the planes.": "哑剧学院是吟游诗人的家，他们发现这个世界是一个喧嚣的地方，有太多的噪音和干扰，无法真正欣赏创造之言或源于它的魔法。因此，他们选择不把自己的声音加到众人身上，而是选择保持沉默，而是专注于自己的动作和意图，在追踪震动整个平面的创造之言的回声时，编织自己的魔法。",
	"Bards of this college are often considered odd and offputting. There's something about a performer who won't speak that seems to give onlookers a feeling that something just isn't right. This can be explained by the fact that these silent performers are in fact altering the weave around them through their intricate and specific movements. Members of this college are usually more level-headed than their counterparts from other colleges, or at least seem so since they cannot voice any ridiculous plans they have out loud. Though those who spend enough time around them to gain an insight into their gesticulations may disagree with the previous assertion.": "这种学院派的吟游诗人往往被认为是古怪的、令人不快的。一个不说话的表演者似乎给旁观者一种感觉，那就是有些事情不对劲。这可以解释为，这些沉默的表演者实际上是在通过他们复杂而特殊的动作改变他们周围的织物。这个学院的成员通常比其他学院的成员更加冷静，或者至少看起来是这样，因为他们不能大声说出他们的任何荒谬计划。尽管那些在他们身边花了足够的时间来深入了解他们的手势的人可能不同意前面的断言。",
	"When you join the College of Pantomime at 3rd level you gain a better understanding of how to manipulate the weave of magic around you with your performance.": "当你在3级时加入哑剧学院，你就能更好地理解如何用你的表演来操纵你周围的魔法之网。",
	"When casting a spell you can replace any verbal components with somatic components. If a spell requires both verbal and somatic components, you can ignore the verbal components. By mastering the use of your gesticulations you have negated the need to vocalize your intentions.": "在施法时，你可以用体质成分代替任何言语成分。如果一个咒语同时需要语言和身体的成分，你可以忽略语言的成分。通过掌握使用你的手势，你就不需要发声表达你的意图了。",
	"As a bonus action, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to pantomime an invisible blade in your hand. This blade deals {@damage 1d6} slashing damage and uses your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. It has the Light property. The blade ceases to exist after 1 hour, if you are incapacitated, or if you let go of it. You can also dismiss it at will.": "作为一个额外的动作，你可以消耗你的一次吟游诗人灵感的使用，在你的手中幻化出一把无形的刀。这把刀造成{@damage 1d6}的斩击伤害，并使用你的魅力修饰，而不是力量或灵巧，来进行攻击和伤害卷。它具有光明属性。这把刀在1小时后就不存在了，如果你失去了能力，或者你放开了它。你也可以随心所欲地解除它。",

	"As an action you may summon up to 6 invisible panels in any orientation and position in any unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you, each panel must share at least one side with one other panel. The panels exist for up to 1 minute, until you dismiss them as an action or until they are destroyed. The panels are 5 foot squares that are 1 inch thick. A creature can determine the location and orientation of these panels by interacting with them or by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC.": "作为一个行动，你可以在你周围60英尺范围内的任何空地上以任何方向和位置召唤最多6个隐形面板，每个面板必须至少与另一个面板共用一个侧面。这些板子的存在时间长达1分钟，直到你用行动将它们解散，或者它们被摧毁。这些板子是5英尺的正方形，1英寸厚。生物可以通过与面板的互动或通过对你的法术救赎DC进行智慧（感知）检查来确定这些面板的位置和方向。",
	"If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the panels (or the panels and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the panels.": "如果一个生物会被面板（或面板和另一个固体表面）四面包围，该生物可以做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果成功，它可以用它的反应来移动到它的速度，这样它就不会再被面板包围了。",
	"The panels are magical objects, each one has AC 15 and 30 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. A dispel magic or disintegrate spell will immediately destroy a single panel.": "这些板子是魔法物品，每块板子都有AC15和30点命中率，并且对毒药和精神伤害免疫。驱散魔法或瓦解法术会立即摧毁一块面板。",

	"Most clerics are pillars of their community, overseeing worship, healing, and religious rites in their god's name. However, all faiths have rules, acts which are seen as taboo and creatures declared anathema. When violations appear, the inquisitors follow, finding the violators and enforcing the law with divine wrath and the point of a sword.": "大多数神职人员是他们社区的支柱，以他们神的名义监督崇拜、治疗和宗教仪式。然而，所有的信仰都有规则，那些被视为禁忌的行为和被宣布为禁忌的生物。当出现违规行为时，审问者就会跟上，找到违规者并以神的愤怒和剑的指向来执行法律。",
	"Inquisitors bring safety to some, but are often fearsome figures in their work. At their best, they protect their communities from corrupting influences of cults, undead, and creatures from the outer planes. At their worst, they are tyrants, leading reigns of terror to quash dissent and oppress those who do not share their faiths.": "审问者给一些人带来了安全，但在他们的工作中往往是令人恐惧的人物。在他们最好的情况下，他们保护他们的社区不受邪教、亡灵和外星生物的破坏性影响。在他们最坏的情况下，他们是暴君，领导恐怖统治来平息异议，压迫那些不认同他们信仰的人。",
	"Inquisitors exist throughout the multiverse, serving causes both good and evil. On many planes, the church of Lolth makes extensive use of them to root out dissent among the drow, and inquisitors of Bahamut are tasked with finding and quashing cults in service of Tiamat. In Faerun, Helm's eternal quest to protect his servants draws many inquisitors, and the efforts of Bane's followers to establish dominion over regions they control encourages many onto the path of the inquisitor. In Eberron, Thrane's Church of the Silver Flame and the secret police of Zilargo include many inquisitors among their ranks. Inquisitors abound among the clerics of Ravenloft, given the predominance of malign entities to be fought, corrupt cults to be stopped, and overbearing tyrants to be served.": "审问者存在于整个多元宇宙，为善与恶的事业服务。在许多位面，洛尔思教会广泛利用他们来根除鸦人中的异议，而巴哈姆特的审问者则负责寻找和镇压为提亚马特服务的邪教。在法隆（Faerun），赫尔姆对保护其仆人的永恒追求吸引了许多审问者，而贝恩的追随者在他们控制的地区建立统治的努力鼓励许多人走上审问者的道路。在艾伯伦，瑟兰的银焰教会和齐拉尔戈的秘密警察中包括许多审问者。审问者在拉文洛夫特的神职人员中比比皆是，因为要打击的是邪恶的实体，要阻止的是腐败的邪教，要服务的是霸道的暴君。",

	"Seers are those touched by gods or other powerful entities in order to help guide others.
