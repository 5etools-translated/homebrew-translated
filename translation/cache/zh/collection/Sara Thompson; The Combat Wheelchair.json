	"Made with the adventurer in mind, the Combat Wheelchair is supportive and intuitive, designed for both daily activity and the pressures of combat during one's adventures. It can be specifically tailored to its user with a variety of intuitive upgrades, designed and created by first-rate artificers and their disabled consultants to ensure high-grade comfort and excellent efficiency. Not only this, the wheelchair prides itself as being sleek, fashionable, and durable at a price affordable for the discerning mobility user.": "战斗轮椅是以冒险者为中心制造的，它具有支持性和直观性，为日常活动和冒险中的战斗压力而设计。它可以通过各种直观的升级为用户专门定制，由一流的工匠和他们的残疾顾问设计和创造，以确保高档次的舒适和出色的效率。不仅如此，这款轮椅还以其光滑、时尚和耐用而自豪，其价格也是那些眼光独到的移动用户所能承受的。",
	"Taking its design from the chair used in sports such as wheelchair basketball and rugby, the Combat Wheelchair can withstand high impact and even work as a weapon in itself, providing the user with a means of both defence and attack.": "战斗轮椅的设计来自于轮椅篮球和橄榄球等运动中使用的椅子，它可以承受高强度的冲击，甚至本身就是一种武器，为使用者提供了一种防御和攻击的手段。",
	"Anyone can be an adventurer.": "任何人都可以成为一个冒险家。",
	"The Combat Wheelchair may look like it comes with lots of Features and some of you may feel that because of this it's \"unfair\" for a character to have this item at first level. However, this chair only has so many Features because it is designed to enable a disabled party member to do exactly what the abled members of the party can do.": "战斗轮椅看起来有很多功能，你们中的一些人可能会觉得，由于这个原因，一个角色在第一级就拥有这个物品是 \"不公平的\"。然而，这把椅子只有这么多的功能，因为它的设计是为了使一个残疾的党员能够做一些有能力的党员能够做的事情。",
	"{@b \"But it can float up and down stairs! Isn't that unfair?\"} No, unless you plan on making all the able bodied characters at level 1 also remain on ground floors only and never go up and down stairs and into dungeons. If you were planning on doing that then that's fair. Wait. What? What do you mean I sound ridiculous, hm?": "{@b \"But it can float up and down stairs! Isn't that unfair?\"}不，除非你打算让所有身强力壮的角色在1级时也只停留在地面上，从不上下楼梯和进入地下城。如果你打算这么做，那么这很公平。等等。什么？你说我听起来很荒唐是什么意思，嗯？",
	"{@b \"But it can be used as a weapon! Isn't that unfair?\"} No, unless you plan on taking away every player's weapon. If you were planning on doing that then that's fair. What do you mean that sounds silly? Additionally, this chair uses the Dungeons & Dragons established rulings that it cannot be used to make Extra Attacks until level 5.": "{@b \"But it can be used as a weapon! Isn't that unfair?\"}不，除非你打算夺走每个玩家的武器。如果你打算这么做，那么这很公平。你说这听起来很傻是什么意思？此外，这把椅子使用了《龙与地下城》的既定规则，即在5级之前不能用来进行额外攻击。",
	"{@b \"But this chair has equipment that comes with it!\"} Yes, in much the same way a sword comes with a sheath and belt, a Dungeoneer's Pack comes with ropes and caltrops, or a horse comes with a saddle and bridle, the Combat Wheelchair comes with seatbelts and gloves.": "{@b \"But this chair has equipment that comes with it!\"}是的，就像剑有剑鞘和腰带，盾牌手的背包有绳索和卡托，或者马有马鞍和马缰绳一样，战斗轮椅也有安全带和手套。",
	"{@b \"But wheelchairs have never been in Dungeons & Dragons! This is nonsense!\"} We suggest you read R.A. Salvatore's {@i Drizzt} novels which are canon to D&D.": "{@b \"But wheelchairs have never been in Dungeons & Dragons! This is nonsense!\"}我们建议你阅读R.A. Salvatore的{@i Drizzt}小说，这些小说是D&D的典范。",
	"{@b \"Why would anyone need a wheelchair? This world has magic!\"} Again, we recommend you read Salvatore's {@i Drizzt} novels. Additionally, healing spells like Restoration and Regeneration are very costly, and what about those of us simply born with our disabilities? You cannot regenerate or restore what was not there to begin with. And some of us? Well, we don't want to be 'fixed'.": "{@b \"Why would anyone need a wheelchair? This world has magic!\"}再次，我们建议你阅读萨尔瓦托的{@i Drizzt}小说。此外，像 \"恢复 \"和 \"再生 \"这样的治疗法术是非常昂贵的，而我们这些只是天生残疾的人呢？你不能再生或恢复一开始就不存在的东西。而我们中的一些人呢？好吧，我们不希望被 \"修复\"。",
	"The Combat Wheelchair is designed to be easy to maintain, upgrade, and repair. Its simplicity is a necessity as an adventurer may not always be able to find a smith, artificer, or other such tinkerer to pit stop at. As a result, you now have proficiency in {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB}.": "战斗轮椅被设计成易于维护、升级和修理。它的简单性是必要的，因为冒险者不一定能找到铁匠、工匠或其他类似的工匠来进行维修。因此，你现在对（%0%）的熟练度。",
	"You are considered as being proficient in using your wheelchair both in everyday tasks and as a weapon in combat. ": "你被认为能够熟练地在日常工作中使用你的轮椅，并在战斗中作为武器使用。",
	"One of the best selling features of this item is its ease of portability - you can take it anywhere on your adventures! This is due to its collapsible design which enables a user to pack it up or pull it out whilst on the go. Folded up, the wheelchair fits neatly onto the back of any cart and can even be attached to the saddlebags of a mount.": "这个项目最畅销的特点之一是它的易携带性--你可以把它带到任何地方去冒险！这是由于它的可折叠设计，使用户可以在旅途中打包或拉出。这是由于其可折叠的设计，使用户能够在旅途中把它打包或拉出来。折叠起来后，轮椅可以整齐地放在任何手推车的后面，甚至可以连接到坐骑的马鞍袋上。",
	"If you plan on trying to carry the Combat Wheelchair by yourself once it has been folded up, remember that it can be quite a challenge to do so, especially over long distances. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15, the result being how much you can carry in pounds (lbs). As this wheelchair doesn't rely on a motor but a mix of manual and a small magically imbued set of Beacon Stones (which are roughly the size and weight of a pebble), it is more lightweight than other wheelchairs available throughout the Realms weighing only 25 pounds (lbs).": "如果你打算在战斗轮椅折叠起来后自己携带它，请记住，这样做可能是一个相当大的挑战，特别是在长距离的情况下。你的搬运能力是你的力量得分乘以15，其结果是你能搬运多少磅（磅）。由于这种轮椅并不依赖马达，而是混合了手动和一套小型的魔法熏陶的信标石（大约是鹅卵石的大小和重量），所以它比整个王国的其他轮椅更轻，只有25磅（磅）重。",
	"However, it is important to remember that 25 pounds (lbs) is the {@b base weight} for the chair. As you add Upgrades, your chair will begin to weigh more and become more cumbersome. Your DM may ask that you keep track of your wheelchair's weight. The weight for each upgrade is specified in the Upgrades section of this item.": "然而，重要的是要记住，25磅（lbs）是椅子的（%0%）。当你增加升级产品时，你的椅子就会开始变重，变得更加笨重。你的DM可能会要求你记录你的轮椅的重量。每个升级件的重量在本项目的升级件部分有规定。",
	"If you find yourself struggling to carry your chair when you aren't using it, be sure to ask your party members for help. After all, what are friends for?": "如果你发现自己在不使用你的椅子时，很难搬动它，一定要向你的党员寻求帮助。毕竟，朋友是干什么的？",
	"The Combat Wheelchair lends itself well to both Strength and Dexterity builds but is also just as perfect for a magic-user. The frame of the chair and the wheels are made from lightweight but durable materials, allowing it to be versatile for the user.": "战斗轮椅很适合力量型和灵巧型建筑，但也同样适合于魔法使用者。椅子的框架和轮子是由轻质但耐用的材料制成的，使它对使用者来说是多功能的。",
	"When casting spells with magical effects, the combat wheelchair is considered as being a part of you; an extension of your body.": "在施展具有魔法效果的法术时，战斗轮椅被认为是你的一部分；是你身体的延伸。",
	"As a result, both you and the chair share the benefit of the spell's effect for the duration or until the spell is dropped.": "结果是，你和椅子都能在持续时间内或在咒语被放弃之前分享咒语效果的好处。",
	"Druids who use {@classFeature Wild Shape|Druid||2}, and transmutation spells that change the user's form (i.e. {@spell Polymorph}, {@spell Shapechange}, etc.) will find that the chair shares the benefit and transforms with them to be a part of the new form.": "德鲁伊使用（%0%），以及改变使用者形态的转化法术（即（%1%）、（%2%）等），会发现椅子会分享其好处，并与他们一起转化为新形态的一部分。",
	"The aid of the chair is still in effect in this new shape. When the Druid changes back, they reappear as sitting in their chair.": "椅子的援助在这个新形状中仍然有效。当德鲁伊变回来的时候，他们会重新出现在他们的椅子上。",
	"As already mentioned, the Combat Wheelchair comes with equipment. But let us address what this means. What do we categorise as 'equipment'?": "正如已经提到的那样，战斗轮椅是有设备的。但让我们来谈谈这意味着什么。我们把什么归类为 \"设备\"？",
	"Well, in much the same way a {@item dungeoneer's pack|PHB} comes with lots of handy little items like {@item torch|PHB|torches}, a {@item tinderbox|PHB}, {@item hempen rope (50 feet)|PHB|ropes}, {@item caltrops (bag of 20)|PHB|caltrops}, etc., the Combat Wheelchair comes with handy little items too. Many of these are actually built into the chair the same way that an {@item explorer's pack|PHB} has pouches and compartments, but only one item comes separate from the chair: the gloves (which you may choose to wear or not).": "嗯，就像{@item dungeoneer's pack|PHB}有很多方便的小物品，如{@item torch|PHB|torches}、{@item tinderbox|PHB}、{@item hempen rope (50 feet)|PHB|ropes}、{@item caltrops (bag of 20)|PHB|caltrops}等一样，战斗轮椅也有方便的小物品。其中许多物品实际上是内置在椅子上的，就像{@item explorer's pack|PHB}有小袋和隔间一样，但只有一件物品是独立于椅子的：手套（你可以选择戴或不戴）。",
	"The Combat Wheelchair comes with 2 pieces of set equipment:": "战斗轮椅配有2件套装设备。",
	"These simple leather gloves grant you protection from friction whilst using the push rims.": "这些简单的皮手套在使用推轮辋时给予你保护，使其免受摩擦。",
	"This bag, which has been designed to fit snug against the back of the chair, is attached to the seat's backrest and the camber bar. This item is the same as an {@item explorer's pack|PHB} in your Starting Gear so you may wish to forgo that and use the backrest compartment instead - it can hold the same items and amount as a standard {@item explorer's pack|PHB} can.": "这个袋子，被设计成紧贴椅背，连接在座椅的靠背和凸条上。这个物品与你的Starting Gear中的{@item explorer's pack|PHB}相同，所以你可能希望放弃它，而使用靠背上的隔间--它可以容纳与标准{@item explorer's pack|PHB}罐相同的物品和数量。",
	"So far it's been mentioned that the Combat Wheelchair is based on the design of the chairs used in high impact sports such as wheelchair rugby and basketball, but what does that mean regarding how the chair actually {@i looks?}": "到目前为止，已经提到战斗轮椅是基于高冲击性运动如轮椅橄榄球和篮球所使用的椅子的设计，但这对于椅子的实际{@i looks?}意味着什么？",
	"None of the items used to make the base frame of the chair give the user any significant benefit, all they do is provide the foundations of an item that allows disabled adventurers to be as independent as abled adventurers.": "用于制造椅子底架的物品都没有给使用者带来任何明显的好处，它们所做的只是提供一个物品的基础，使残疾冒险者能够像健全的冒险者一样独立。",
	"There are 5 main aspects to the chair's anatomy:": "椅子的解剖结构有5个主要方面。",
	"These wheels allow for easy passage over Coast, Forest, Grassland, and Mountain terrains. Similar to how a Ranger finds ease over lands familiar to them, the artificers who carried out data research discovered that these 4 terrain types are the ones most often traversed by adventuring parties. The slant of the wheels as they turn inwards and upwards disperses weight evenly and gives you good control when travelling over these terrains. The spokes are covered by wooden covers to prevent debris getting tangled in them. {@b Upgrades} for tyres that account for more terrains at an additional cost are available in the {@b Upgrades} section of this item's description.": "这些轮子可以轻松通过海岸、森林、草原和山地的地形。与游侠在他们熟悉的土地上找到轻松的感觉类似，进行数据研究的工匠们发现，这4种地形类型是冒险队伍最经常穿越的地形。轮子向内和向上转动时的斜面可以均匀地分散重量，在这些地形上行驶时可以得到良好的控制。辐条由木质盖子覆盖，以防止碎片缠住它们。(在本项目描述的{@b Upgrades}部分，可提供用于更多地形的轮胎，但需要额外费用。",
	"About the frame of the chair are an additional 3 small pouches, near the armrests. One of these serves as a waterskin holder to save you from having to waste time stopping and rummaging around the rear backrest compartment looking for your drink. It acts the same way as another adventurer might wear theirs at their hip for convenience. The other 2 pouches can be used to hold your weapon(s), much like a sword belt or shield harness, or can simply be used to carry a bit more gear - much like trouser pockets.": "在椅子的框架上有另外3个小袋子，靠近扶手。其中一个作为水皮袋，使你不必浪费时间停下来在后部靠背隔间里翻找你的饮料。它的作用与其他冒险家为方便起见可能把他们的水袋放在臀部的方式相同。另外两个袋子可以用来放置你的武器，就像剑带或盾牌背带一样，或者可以简单地用来携带更多的装备--就像裤子的口袋一样。",
	"This small lever sits just under the seat. When pressed as an action, it releases a lock mechanism that causes the seat to tilt up so that getting in and out of the chair is easier.": "这个小杠杆就在座椅下面。当按下这个动作时，它就会释放一个锁定机制，使座椅向上倾斜，这样进出椅子就更容易了。",
	"These armrests are affixed to the chair and are adjustable to your arms' length. Within one of the armrests (your choice) is a {@b beacon stone}. Refer to the final point in this section for details on {@b beacon stones}.": "这些扶手贴在椅子上，可以根据你的手臂长度进行调整。在其中一个扶手内（你的选择）是一个（%0%）。关于{@b beacon stones}的细节，请参考本节的最后一点。",
	"These seatbelts are affixed to the chair and strap about the waist, knees and shins. This helps to hold you in the chair correctly and prevents them from falling out whenever the chair is struck, thrown, or handled roughly by a creature or spell in combat. These belts all have clasp buckles which can be undone by using a bonus action to press the release buttons.": "这些安全带贴在椅子上，绑在腰部、膝盖和小腿上。这有助于将你正确地固定在椅子上，并防止在战斗中椅子被生物或法术击打、抛掷或粗暴地处理时掉出来。这些腰带都有扣子，可以通过使用奖励动作按下释放按钮来解开。",
	"These stones are common, factory-made by artificers across the Realms for this sole purpose. They are magically imbued with very low-level {@i transmutation magic.} To be specific, they carry about the same level of energy as a {@i cantrip spell} does, providing enough energy for a little boost and nothing more.<br />Each chair comes with one of these stones set into an armrest (your choice) and you can use it in 2 different ways. The first is that you can run your hand or fingers over it to indicate and guide the chair in which direction you want it to go—this use was designed for users who may not have full use of their arms or an illness or disability which means they lack the energy to push the chair themselves. Regardless of whether you push or direct the chair using the stone, the Combat Wheelchair always has a base movement speed of 25 feet.<br />The second way to use this stone is when faced with {@b ascending or descending} stairs; the true favoured enemy of many a wheelchair user. Refer to the next section for details on how to use this chair with stairs.<br />Additionally, the Beacon Stone is unique in that it only responds to the owner's touch. If someone who is not the chair's user attempts to use the stone, the chair will not respond and will, instead, have to be moved using the push rims.<br /> {@spell Dispel Magic} has no effect upon this stone.": "These stones are common, factory-made by artificers across the Realms for this sole purpose.

	"We all know dungeons often have a lot of stairs and, sweet Azalin, let's not get started on {@i Castle Ravenloft's} maze of steps! Let's face it, stairs are difficult, especially when you're in a wheelchair, which is why the {@b beacon stone} is here to help.": "我们都知道地下城经常有很多楼梯，而且，可爱的阿扎林，我们不要开始说{@i Castle Ravenloft's}迷宫一样的台阶! 让我们面对现实吧，楼梯是很困难的，特别是当你坐在轮椅上的时候，这就是为什么{@b beacon stone}会在这里提供帮助。",
	"By tapping your fingers or hand against the stone twice, you inform it that it needs to help you go up or down a flight of stairs. As a result the chair begins to hover, starting at 2 feet off the ground. Using your fingers or hand on the stone's surface, you guide it to go forwards or backwards (depending on which direction the stairs go in) on the staircase, tapping the stone twice to hover up to the next step or tapping once if you would like it to hover down. The chair will always hover 2 feet over the step it is above when being used in this manner and can continue ascending or descending like this until the end of the stairs has been reached.": "通过用手指或手敲击石头两次，你通知它，它需要帮助你上下楼。结果，椅子开始盘旋，从离地2英尺处开始。用你的手指或手放在石头表面，你引导它在楼梯上向前或向后走（取决于楼梯的方向），轻敲石头两次，让它盘旋到下一个台阶，如果你想让它盘旋下来，就轻敲一次。以这种方式使用时，椅子将始终在其上方的台阶上盘旋2英尺，并可以继续像这样上升或下降，直到到达楼梯的尽头。",
	"Once you have reached the top or bottom of the stairs you can continue to move the chair as it usually does using either the push rims or by directing it with the stone.": "一旦你到达了楼梯的顶部或底部，你可以继续像通常那样用推轮圈或用石头指挥椅子移动。",
	"Using the {@variantrule Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item|XGE|Create Magic Item} downtime ({@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything}), you - or an ally - can spend the time imbuing the chair with a low-level pulse of {@i transmutation magic}. This typically appears in the form of a Dwarven rune engraved into the chair's frame. Once this process has been completed, you will find that you are now able to use telepathy to command the chair's movements and it will respond accordingly. This telepathy does not require concentration, working off your quick-passing thoughts instead.": "利用{@variantrule Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item|XGE|Create Magic Item}的停工时间({@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything})，你--或一个盟友--可以用这段时间给椅子注入{@i transmutation magic}的低级脉冲。这通常是以矮人符文的形式出现，刻在椅子的框架上。一旦这个过程完成，你会发现你现在可以用心灵感应来指挥椅子的运动，它也会做出相应的反应。这种心灵感应不需要集中注意力，而是通过你快速传递的思想来进行。",
	"This variant means the chair is now a {@i Magic Item} but isn't affected by {@spell Dispel Magic} in accordance with the spell's description ({@book Player's Handbook}). ": "这个变体意味着椅子现在是一个{@i Magic Item}，但根据法术的描述({@book Player's Handbook})，不受{@spell Dispel Magic}的影响。",
	"The Combat Wheelchair can be used as a weapon that can make {@b Melee Weapon Attacks}. At lower levels, you may wish to use one of these attacks instead of a standard weapon attack. At higher levels, you may want to use the chair in this way for your Extra Attack. You are considered as being {@b proficient} in using the wheelchair as a weapon.": "战斗轮椅可以作为一种武器使用，可以使（%0%）。在较低的级别，你可能希望使用其中的一个攻击，而不是标准的武器攻击。在较高的级别，你可能希望以这种方式使用椅子进行额外攻击。在使用轮椅作为武器时，你被认为是（%1%）。",

Additionally, a hand  holding a one-handed or versatile weapon can still move the chair using either the push rims or the {@b Beacon Stone}.": "在战斗中，椅子仍然可以通过使用（%0%）来单手移动。此外，持有单手或多功能武器的手仍然可以使用推圈或（1%）移动椅子。",
	"See the {@object Combat Wheelchair|CombatWheelchair} for more information.": "更多信息见{@object Combat Wheelchair|CombatWheelchair}。",
	"If you have ever seen a game of wheelchair basketball or rugby, you'll understand that the chairs used are very durable and can withstand the impact of tackling at high speeds.": "如果你看过一场轮椅篮球或橄榄球比赛，你就会明白，所使用的椅子非常耐用，可以承受高速攻防的冲击。",
	"The Combat Wheelchair doesn't have hit points, the same way a sword or a shield doesn't. However, it can withstand 3 consecutive {@b Critical Hits} (inflicted by either Melee Weapons or Melee Spells) before it needs repairing with either {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB} or {@item Smith's Tools|PHB}. You can also pay for the chair to be repaired at a cost of 100gp. Once repaired, the chair is as good as new. Whilst the chair needs to be repaired, you can still use it for everyday tasks such as mobility and ascending or descending stairs and any upgrades you have acquired remain in effect. Only {@b Critical Hits} damage the chair, normal attack damage does not.": "战斗轮椅没有命中率，就像剑或盾牌没有命中率一样。然而，在需要用{@item Tinker's Tools|PHB}或{@item Smith's Tools|PHB}修复之前，它可以连续承受3次{@b Critical Hits}（由近战武器或近战法术造成的）。你也可以花100gp的费用来修理这把椅子。一旦修好，椅子就会像新的一样。虽然椅子需要修理，但你仍然可以用它来做日常工作，比如移动和上下楼梯，而且你所获得的任何升级仍然有效。只有{@b Critical Hits}会对椅子造成伤害，普通的攻击伤害则不会。",
	"The chair must take 3x the amount of Critical Hits it can withstand before it can be repaired consecutively in order for it and any {@b Upgrades} it has to be rendered completely broken and unusable. If this happens, you can either pay for a new base chair at 200gp or pay upwards of 500gp or more (depending on the price of the {@b Upgrades} you had) to have it completely rebuilt and kitted out with the {@b Upgrades} your old chair had.": "椅子必须承受3倍于它所能承受的关键打击，才能连续修复，以使它和它所拥有的任何{@b Upgrades}变得完全破碎，无法使用。如果发生这种情况，你可以以200gp的价格购买一把新的基本椅子，或者支付500gp以上的费用（取决于你所拥有的{@b Upgrades}的价格），让它完全重建并装备上你的旧椅子所拥有的{@b Upgrades}。",
	"However, the rulings of {@b Critical Hits} and how they affect the chair are completely optional and you don't have to use them in your game in order to have a fun experience.": "然而，{@b Critical Hits}的裁定以及它们对椅子的影响是完全可选的，你不必为了获得有趣的体验而在游戏中使用它们。",
	"Additionally, the {@spell Mending} cantrip can be used to fix any breaks in the chair that are cleanly done and specified as being in two parts. For example, if the camber bar breaks after the chair reaches its {@b Critical Hit} limit and upon inspection is reveal to only be broken in two, you or an ally can cast {@spell Mending} to repair it instantly.": "此外，{@spell Mending}的咒语可以用来修复椅子上的任何断裂，这些断裂都是干净利落的，并被指定为两部分。例如，如果在椅子达到{@b Critical Hit}的极限后，外倾杆断裂，经检查发现只是断成了两截，你或盟友可以施放{@spell Mending}来立即修复它。",
	"Falling damage still occurs as standard, dealing damage to the chair's user. However, if you are using the optional {@b Critical Hits} ruling, the chair needs 1 repair per every 60ft the chair falls.": "坠落的伤害仍然会像标准那样发生，对椅子的使用者造成伤害。然而，如果你使用的是可选的（%0%）规则，那么椅子每下降60英尺就需要进行一次修复。",
	"The Combat Wheelchair has 4 optional Features available to you. You can choose whether or not to include them in your game.": "战斗轮椅有4个可选的功能供你使用。你可以选择是否将它们包括在你的游戏中。",
	"The standard Combat Wheelchair (as it has been described to you thus far) costs 200gp which is more expensive than a simple wheelchair (typically 5gp). This is because the Combat Wheelchair is designed specially for use on the battlefield and during adventures and has been built with durable materials.": "标准的战斗轮椅（正如迄今为止向你描述的那样）需要200gp，比简单的轮椅（通常为5gp）要贵。这是因为战斗轮椅是专门为在战场上和冒险中使用而设计的，并且是用耐用材料制造的。",
	"But what about if you're a character who is beginning their adventure and is disabled from the get-go? Perhaps you were born with your disability or illness, or maybe part of your backstory includes an accident or injury that predates your career as an adventurer? If this is the case, speak with your DM and consider having the Combat Wheelchair be part of your items without having to pay for it - perhaps you paid for one already as part of your backstory? Perhaps you would like to forgo having skills you acquired as part of your background and take the wheelchair instead? The choice is yours at the end of the day.": "但是，如果你是一个正在开始冒险的角色，并且从一开始就是残疾的呢？也许你的残疾或疾病是与生俱来的，或者你的背景故事中有一部分是在你成为冒险家之前发生的意外或受伤？如果是这种情况，请与你的管理员商量，考虑让战斗轮椅成为你物品的一部分，而不需要支付它--也许你已经支付了一个作为你背景故事的一部分？也许你想放弃你作为背景的一部分而获得的技能，而用轮椅代替？在一天结束时，选择权在你手中。",
	"If you happen to take a lasting injury or otherwise become disabled whilst on your travels, you can buy a Combat Wheelchair at any time for 200gp from any good merchant.": "如果你在旅行中碰巧受了持久的伤或以其他方式变成了残疾人，你可以在任何时候花200gp从任何一个好的商人那里购买一个战斗轮椅。",
	"{@b Remember:} the Combat Wheelchair does not give a disabled character an \"advantage\" over the abled characters. All it does is enable disabled characters to do the things an abled adventurer can. You should not be punished for something you cannot help and to be punished for having a disability is cruel.": "{@b Remember:}战斗轮椅并没有给残疾角色带来比健全角色更多的 \"优势\"。它所做的只是让残疾角色能够做残疾冒险者可以做的事情。你不应该因为你无法帮助的事情而受到惩罚，因为有残疾而受到惩罚是很残酷的。",

	"This is where the Upgrades come in!": "这就是升级的意义所在!",
	"There are a variety of Upgrades available to you on your journey and they can typically be bought and affixed to your wheelchair at any blacksmith's, artificer's, or forge.": "在你的旅途中，有各种各样的升级品，它们通常可以在任何铁匠铺、工匠铺或锻造厂买到并贴在你的轮椅上。",
	"Kit your Combat Wheelchair out in a way that best suits you and what you find yourself needing whilst out adventuring in the world! Even more fun, this part of the Combat Wheelchair lends itself well to your own homebrews, so why not make a special upgrade of your own too?": "以最适合你的方式装备你的战斗轮椅，当你发现自己在这个世界上冒险的时候，你需要的是什么？更有趣的是，战斗轮椅的这一部分很适合你自己的自酿酒，所以为什么不自己做一个特别的升级呢？",
	"Some Upgrades cannot be used together due to either there not being enough room on the chair for both, or that one Upgrade's effects may negate anothers. These have been detailed when relevant.": "有些升级不能一起使用，因为椅子上没有足够的空间容纳两个升级，或者一个升级的效果可能会否定另一个。这些都在相关的地方进行了详细说明。",
	"You're perhaps wondering: {@i What happens if I attach a shield to the side of my wheelchair? Does that mean my chair gets the +2 AC bonus?}": "你也许想知道: {@i What happens if I attach a shield to the side of my wheelchair? Does that mean my chair gets the +2 AC bonus?}",
	"The answer is no, your chair would not get the bonus. The same goes for randomly attaching any weapon or armour to the chair that isn't classified specifically as an Upgrade.": "答案是否定的，你的椅子将不会得到奖励。将任何武器或盔甲随机安装在椅子上也是如此，而这些武器或盔甲并没有被特别归类为升级。",
	"Why is this?

Learning to manage their chronic pain levels and dabbling in Psionic Magics to provide them with a disability aid when on the hunt, these Blood Hunters seek not cure themselves but to continue their lives and their life's work: hunting monsters.": "成为一名猎血者，往往是将自己置于巨大的危险之中。他们经常被逼无奈地做出决定，这意味着生与死的区别。许多走上这条人生道路的人很快就会发现自己身负重伤和/或重大疾病，这已不是什么大秘密。如果一个猎血人不是生来就有残疾，那么他们极有可能在某一时刻出现残疾；就像任何生活在危险中的冒险者一样，充满了怪物和往往是致命的魔法。多年来，形成了一个猎血人组织，专注于接受他们的残疾和慢性疾病，以及如何与他们合作。叙事团。学会控制他们的慢性疼痛程度，并涉足幻术，以便在狩猎时为他们提供残疾援助，这些猎血者寻求的不是治愈自己，而是继续他们的生活和他们一生的工作：猎杀怪物。",
	"You can use the {@item combat wheelchair|CombatWheelchair} ruleset with this subclass and your chair is considered a weapon you are proficient in when making attacks with it. As such, you can use your {@classFeature Crimson Rite|Blood Hunter|BH2020|2||Crimson Rites} on the chair as you would any weapon.": "你可以使用{@item combat wheelchair|CombatWheelchair}的规则，你的椅子在使用它进行攻击时被认为是你精通的武器。因此，你可以在椅子上使用你的（%1%），就像你使用任何武器一样。",
	"Upon joining this order at 3rd level, you have a pain threshold higher than most and have experience in knowing how to manage chronic pain in ways that best work for you. This doesn't mean your pain has subsided, or that you hurt less, but you've started to notice your methods of managing are having an effect on your Crimson Rites and Blood Curses.": "在3级加入本教团时，你的疼痛阈值高于大多数人，并且有经验知道如何以最适合你的方式管理慢性疼痛。这并不意味着你的疼痛已经消退，或者你的疼痛减少了，但你已经开始注意到你的管理方法对你的深红仪式和血咒产生了影响。",
	"When you activate your rite for the first time that day, you gain 1 HP back when you roll your hemocraft die. You can only use this feature for a single crimson rite once per long rest.": "当你当天第一次激活你的仪式时，当你掷出你的造血模子时，你会获得1个HP的回复。你只能在每次长休时对单一的深红仪式使用此功能。",

	"At 3rd level, you learn how to siphon some of the chronic pain you experience daily into your weapon whenever you activate your crimson rite (remember: your {@item combat wheelchair|CombatWheelchair} is also considered as a weapon you are proficient in when attacking with it). This process does not reduce your own chronic pain levels at all, instead it imbues your weapon with some of your experience. Whilst your rite is active, it gains the additional effects:": "三级时，你学会了如何在激活你的深红仪式时，将你每天经历的一些慢性疼痛抽吸到你的武器中（记住：你的（%0%）在用它进行攻击时也被视为你所精通的武器）。这个过程完全不会降低你自己的慢性疼痛水平，相反，它将你的一些经验注入你的武器中。当你的仪式处于激活状态时，它会获得额外的效果。",
	"You have resistance to piercing damage.": "你对穿刺伤害有抵抗力。",
	"Whenever you roll full damage on your hemocraft die, you can roll it again and add the additional damage as psychic.": "每当你在你的造血术模子上掷出全额伤害时，你可以再次掷出，并将额外的伤害作为精神上的伤害。",
	"Starting at 7th level, you have started to weave your magical talents into a form that can carry echoed resemblances of your experienced chronic pain. Your Order has tapped into the secrets of Psionic Magics, referred to as your psi, developing them in a way that allows you to work {@i with} your chronic illness and/or disability. Your pain isn't reduced, nor is it ‘cured' using such magic, but it acts as an aid, assisting you in combat.": "从7级开始，你已经开始将你的魔法天赋编织成一种形式，可以带着你所经历的慢性疼痛的呼应相似性。你的教团已经挖掘了幻象魔法的秘密，被称为你的psi，以一种允许你对你的慢性病和/或残疾进行工作的方式发展它们（%0%）。你的疼痛并没有减少，也没有用这种魔法 \"治愈\"，但它作为一种辅助手段，在战斗中协助你。",
	"At the beginning of every day, you roll a single {@dice d12} and add nothing to it. This is your CP Level Die, a representation of your chronic pain and the number you roll indicates the level your pain is at until the next day when you roll again. A 12 means you are in significant chronic pain, whereas a 1 means you are having a ‘good day' (this doesn't mean that you aren't in pain, just that it is currently manageable). Make note of the number you roll on your sheet.": "在每天开始时，你掷出一个{@dice d12}的数字，并不加任何东西。这是你的慢性疼痛等级模子，代表你的慢性疼痛，你掷出的数字表示你的疼痛程度，直到第二天你再次掷出。12意味着你处于明显的慢性疼痛中，而1意味着你有一个 \"好日子\"（这并不意味着你没有疼痛，只是意味着目前可以控制）。在你的表格上记下你掷出的数字。",
	"When you next take damage, you can use your reaction to throw up a protective barrier formed by this psionic magic and your pain and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled on your CP Level Die.": "当你下次受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应抛出一个由这个幻象魔法和你的痛苦形成的保护屏障，并减少你的CP等级骰子上滚动的数字所造成的伤害。",
	"Much like blood curses, this feature can be amplified by losing a number of hit points determined by one roll of your hemocraft die. Your {@subclassclassFeature High Threshold|Blood Hunter|BH2020|Syphonic|CombatWheelchair|3} feature can apply to this.": "和血腥诅咒一样，这个特性可以通过失去一个由你的血肉之躯骰子决定的命中率数量来放大。你的（%0%）特征可以适用于此。",
	"You can use this feature once per day.": "你每天可以使用这个功能一次。",
	"You can attempt to sling the damage your barrier absorbs back at a creature within 30ft of you. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (the DC being the same as your Hemocraft save DC). On a success, the creature only takes half damage. When you throw this damage back, it is converted into psychic damage by the psionic nature of your barrier's magic. At level 15, this amplification doubles both the amount of damage the barrier can take and send back to the target.": "你可以尝试将你的屏障所吸收的伤害抛向你周围30英尺内的一个生物。这个生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作（DC与你的血术救赎DC相同）。如果成功，该生物只受到一半的伤害。当你把这个伤害扔回去时，它被你的屏障魔法的幻象性质转化为精神伤害。在15级时，这种放大作用使屏障所能承受的伤害量和送回目标的伤害量都翻倍。",
	"Additionally, you also gain knowledge of one blood curse of your choosing so long as you meet any prerequisites it may have. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.": "此外，你还能获得你所选择的一个血咒的知识，只要你满足它可能具有的任何先决条件。这并不计入你所知道的血腥诅咒的数量。",
	"At 11th level, you centre yourself, focusing on your areas of pain and projecting them into your psi to create echoes you magically imbue into your fighting style. When you next successfully hit a target creature, you can choose to use your bonus action to blast them with your psi, letting them briefly experience some semblance of the pain levels you feel every day, overwhelming them.": "在11级时，你以自己为中心，专注于你的疼痛区域，并将它们投射到你的psi中，创造出回声，你用魔法将其注入你的战斗风格中。当你下次成功击中一个目标生物时，你可以选择使用你的额外行动，用你的psi轰击他们，让他们短暂地体验到一些你每天感受到的痛苦程度的影子，压倒他们。",
	"The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw - the DC the same as your Hemocraft save DC - or take {@damage 3d8} psychic damage. If the creature fails, it must continue to make the save on each of its turns, taking an additional {@damage 1d8} psychic damage until it succeeds.": "该生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作--其DC与你的Hemocraft救赎DC相同--否则会受到{@damage 3d8}精神伤害。如果失败了，它必须在每个回合继续进行救赎，受到额外的（%1%）精神伤害，直到它成功。",
	"You can use this feature once per long rest.": "你可以在每个长时间的休息中使用这个功能一次。",
	"Beginning at 15th level, your {@classFeature Brand of Castigation|Blood Hunter|BH2020|6} becomes imbued with your psi, allowing you to aggravate a foe's fresh wounds once they have been damaged in battle. Whenever you damage a branded creature using your crimson rite, your weapon deals an additional amount of damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, plus your CP Level Die score for the day.": "从15级开始，你的（%0%）会被灌注你的psi，使你能够在敌人在战斗中受到伤害后加重他们的新伤势。每当你用你的深红仪式伤害一个被烙印的生物时，你的武器就会造成额外的伤害，相当于你的血术模子的一卷，加上你当天的CP等级模子得分。",
	"At 18th level, you learn to exert what little grasp you have left on your pain-echoing psi as death comes to claim you. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you unleash a great wave of energy from your person in a 30ft radius. Every hostile creature within range must make a Wisdom saving throw (the DC the same as your Hemocraft save DC) or take {@damage 5d10} psychic damage and become {@condition stunned} until the end of their next turn as a blast of pure pain suddenly hits them. If they succeed, they take half damage and aren't {@condition stunned}.": "在18级的时候，你学会了在死亡来临的时候对你的痛苦回响的psi施加你所剩无几的控制力。当你的生命值降至0时，你会从你身上释放出一股巨大的能量波动，半径为30英尺。范围内的每一个敌对生物都必须做一个智慧救赎（DC与你的Hemocraft救赎DC相同），否则就会受到（%0%）的精神伤害，并且在下一回合结束前，会变成（%1%），因为一阵纯粹的痛苦突然袭击了他们。如果他们成功了，他们会受到一半的伤害，并且不会变成（%2%）。",
	"After this, you don't necessarily die outright, instead you can choose to drop to 1 hit point and take 1 point of {@condition exhaustion}. If you choose to fall instead, you begin making death saving throws as normal at the start of your next turn and don't take a point of exhaustion.": "在这之后，你不一定会直接死亡，相反，你可以选择下降到1点命中率并承受1点（%0%）。如果你选择倒下，你就会在下一回合开始时像往常一样进行死亡救赎，并且不会受到一点疲惫的影响。",
	"These stones are common, factory-made by artificers across the Realms for this sole purpose. They are magically imbued with very low-level {@i transmutation magic.} To be specific, they carry about the same level of energy as a {@i cantrip spell} does, providing enough energy for a little boost and nothing more.": "这些石头很常见，由整个王国的工匠们在工厂制造，目的只有一个。它们被神奇地注入了非常低级的{@i transmutation magic.}，具体来说，它们携带的能量与{@i cantrip spell}的能量水平差不多，提供足够的能量来进行小规模的提升，仅此而已。",
	"Each chair comes with one of these stones set into an armrest (your choice) and you can use it in 2 different ways. The first is that you can run your hand or fingers over it to indicate and guide the chair in which direction you want it to go—this use was designed for users who may not have full use of their arms or an illness or disability which means they lack the energy to push the chair themselves. Regardless of whether you push or direct the chair using the stone, the Combat Wheelchair always has a base movement speed of 25 feet.": "每张椅子的扶手上都有一个这样的石头（你自己选择），你可以用两种不同的方式使用它。第一种方式是，你可以用手或手指在上面指示和引导椅子往哪个方向走--这种方式是为那些手臂不能完全使用或有疾病或残疾的用户设计的，这意味着他们缺乏能量来自己推动椅子。无论你是用石头推还是引导椅子，战斗轮椅的基本移动速度始终为25英尺。",
	"The second way to use this stone is when faced with {@b ascending or descending} stairs; the true favoured enemy of many a wheelchair user. Refer to the next section for details on how to use this chair with stairs.": "使用这块石头的第二种方式是面对{@b ascending or descending}楼梯的时候；这是许多轮椅使用者真正喜欢的敌人。请参考下一节，了解如何在楼梯上使用这把椅子的细节。",
	"Additionally, the Beacon Stone is unique in that it only responds to the owner's touch. If someone who is not the chair's user attempts to use the stone, the chair will not respond and will, instead, have to be moved using the push rims.": "此外，烽火石的独特之处在于，它只对主人的触摸做出反应。如果不是椅子使用者的人试图使用石头，椅子将没有反应，而是必须使用推轮圈来移动。",
	" {@spell Dispel Magic} has no effect upon this stone.": " {@spell Dispel Magic}对这个石头没有影响。",
	"You can use the {@item combat wheelchair|CombatWheelchair} ruleset with this subclass and your chair is considered a weapon you are proficient in when making attacks with it. As such, you can use your {@classFeature Crimson Rite|Blood Hunter|BH2022|2||Crimson Rites} on the chair as you would any weapon.": "你可以使用{@item combat wheelchair|CombatWheelchair}规则，当你用椅子进行攻击时，你的椅子被视为你精通的武器。因此，你可以在椅子上使用你的（%1%），就像你使用任何武器一样。",
