	"While clockwork spells originated in Zobek and then appeared in the Midgard campaign setting, they can fit into your campaign world just as well. The most likely origins of the clockwork devices themselves are in ancient temples, where gears and simple machines were used to perform miracles for the gathered faithful. Descriptions of complex clockwork can be found in Chinese writing dating to over 2,500 years ago. The Antikythera mechanism, named for the Greek island near where it was discovered, is an example of a sophisticated clockwork device nearly 2,100 years old. It was likely used for astronomical navigation. In European history, this technology was never particularly widespread, and it was lost entirely after the Roman era. Given the late medieval or early renaissance era technology of the average fantasy campaign world, and the fact that most are replete with lost ancient empires, there's no reason that clockwork technology can't be widespread, or at least maintained in isolated pockets.": "虽然发条法术起源于佐贝克，然后出现在米德加德的战役设定中，但它们同样可以适合你的战役世界。钟表装置本身最可能的起源是在古代的寺庙中，那里的齿轮和简单的机器被用来为聚集在一起的信徒们创造奇迹。在2500多年前的中国文字中可以找到关于复杂的钟表装置的描述。安提凯希拉装置因其发现地附近的希腊岛屿而得名，是一个有近2100年历史的复杂发条装置的例子。它很可能被用于天文导航。在欧洲历史上，这种技术从未特别普及，而且在罗马时代之后完全消失。考虑到一般幻想战役世界的中世纪晚期或文艺复兴早期的技术，以及大多数都充满了失落的古代帝国的事实，没有理由发条技术不能普及，或者至少在孤立的小块区域保持。",
	"The origins of clockwork magic, however, are nebulous at best. Those of a religious bent say that it's derived from the divine, that a follower of some god of smiths or machines or even time had an epiphany. Others, usually those of a less religious bent, claim that clockwork magic was the discovery of an ancient artificer who, while experimenting with gears and steam, built the first device animated by enchantments. Whatever its origin, clockwork magic involves time manipulation, constructs, and mechanical devices of all kinds.": "然而，发条魔法的起源充其量也是模糊不清的。那些有宗教倾向的人说，它来自神灵，某个铁匠或机器甚至时间之神的追随者顿悟了。其他人，通常是那些宗教色彩较淡的人，声称发条魔法是一位古代工匠的发现，他在试验齿轮和蒸汽时，建造了第一个由魔法激活的设备。无论其起源如何，发条魔法涉及时间操纵、构造和各种机械装置。",

	"The idea of a gearforged seems very heroic to me; giving up your flesh for a metal body (even if a nigh immortal one) so you can commit yourself to the defense of your land is noble. I wanted a few gearforged that weren't so noble but were a little more mysterious. The hellforged is to the gearforged as the tiefling is to the human; they have hints of dark secrets. While the disembodied spirit summoned by the ritual likely wants out of whatever place it was in, it doesn't want this. The ritual simply reaches out and snares a suitable candidate, willing or otherwise, by whatever means possible. Thus the ritual gives players a chance to be a monster not of their own making.": "对我来说，齿轮锻造者的想法似乎非常英雄；放弃你的肉体，换取一个金属的身体（即使是一个近乎不朽的身体），这样你就可以致力于保卫你的土地，这很高尚。我想要一些不那么高贵但更神秘的齿轮锻造者。地狱锻造者对于齿轮锻造者来说，就像铁弗林对于人类一样；他们有黑暗秘密的暗示。虽然被仪式召唤出来的失魂落魄的灵魂很可能想要离开它所处的任何地方，但它并不想要这个。仪式只是伸出手来，通过任何可能的手段，抓住一个合适的人选，不管是自愿的还是其他的。因此，这个仪式给了玩家一个机会，成为一个不属于他们自己的怪物。",

This effectively {@condition paralyzed|phb|paralyzes} a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, {@item scale mail|phb} would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a {@item breastplate|phb} would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are completely {@condition paralyzed}. An affected creature or construct repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success, though constructs make this saving throw with disadvantage. A {@spell grease} spell dispels {@spell lock armor|DM01} on everything in its area of effect.": "你的目标是一件金属装备或一个金属构件。如果目标是穿着金属盔甲的生物或者是构筑物，它可以用智慧投掷来否定这个效果。如果蓄力失败，该法术会使金属粘附在金属上，使其无法相互移动。这将有效地使金属制成的生物或穿着金属盔甲的生物在移动时受到影响；例如，(1%)会被锁住，因为鳞片必须相互滑动，但(2%)则不受影响。有限的移动可能仍然是可能的，这取决于盔甲的范围有多大，而且语言通常不受影响。金属结构体则完全（%3%）。受影响的生物或构筑物在其每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对自身的影响，但构筑物在进行蓄力时处于不利地位。一个{@spell grease}的法术会驱散{@spell lock armor|DM01}在其作用范围内的所有东西。",
	"When casting this spell using a 3rd level slot or higher, you may target 1 additional creature or item per level.": "当使用3级或更高等级的槽施放此法术时，你可以针对每一级的额外生物或物品。",
	"You sacrifice a willing construct you can see to imbue a willing target with construct traits. The target gains resistance to all nonmagical damage and gains immunity to the {@condition blinded}, {@condition charmed}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition petrified}, and {@condition poisoned} conditions.": "你牺牲一个你能看到的自愿的构筑物，给一个自愿的目标灌输构筑物的特性。目标获得对所有非魔法伤害的抗性，并获得对{@condition blinded}、{@condition charmed}、{@condition deafened}、{@condition frightened}、{@condition petrified}和{@condition poisoned}条件的免疫。",
	"You touch a creature and give it the capacity to carry, lift, push, or drag weight as if it were one size category larger. If you're using the {@variantrule encumbrance|phb} rules, the target is not subject to penalties for weight. Furthermore, the subject can carry loads that would normally be unwieldy.": "你触碰一个生物并赋予它携带、举起、推动或拖曳重量的能力，就像它大一个体型类别一样。如果你使用的是{@variantrule encumbrance|phb}规则，目标就不会受到重量的惩罚。此外，目标可以携带通常会很笨重的负荷。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot higher than 1st, you can touch one additional creature for each spell level.": "当你使用高于第一级的法术槽施展此法术时，你可以在每一个法术等级中额外接触一个生物。",
	"Your voice, and to a lesser extent your mind, changes to communicate only in the whirring clicks of machine speech. Until the end of your next turn, all clockwork spells you cast have advantage on their attack rolls or the targets have disadvantage on their saving throws.": "你的声音，以及在较小程度上你的思想，都会改变，只用机器说话的呼啸声来交流。直到你的下一个回合结束，你施展的所有发条法术在攻击卷上都有优势，或者目标在蓄力上有劣势。",
	"As {@spell repair metal|DM01}, but you can affect all metal within range. You repair {@dice 1d8 + 5} damage to a metal object or construct by sealing up rents and bending metal back into place.": "如同{@spell repair metal|DM01}，但你可以影响范围内的所有金属。你可以通过密封裂缝和弯曲金属来修复金属物体或构筑物的损伤（1%）。",
	"Casting mass repair metal as a 6th-level spell repairs {@dice 2d8 + 10} damage.": "将大规模修复金属作为六级法术施展，可以修复（%0%）的伤害。",
	"You can take control of a construct by voice or mental commands. The construct makes a Wisdom saving throw to resist the spell, and it gets advantage on the saving throw if its CR equals or exceeds your level in the class used to cast this spell. Once a command is given, the construct does everything it can to complete the command. Giving a new command takes an action. Constructs will risk harm, even go into combat, on your orders but will not self-destruct; giving such an order ends the spell.": "你可以通过声音或精神命令来控制一个构造体。构造体会用智慧救赎来抵抗该法术，如果它的CR等于或超过你用于施放该法术的等级，那么它在救赎上会获得优势。一旦发出了命令，构装体就会尽其所能地完成该命令。发出一个新的命令需要一个行动。构造物会在你的命令下冒着伤害的风险，甚至进入战斗状态，但不会自我毁灭；发出这样的命令会结束这个法术。",
	"You call upon the dark blessings of the furnace god Molech. In an hour-long ritual begun at midnight, you dedicate a living being to Molech by branding the deity's symbol onto the victim's forehead. If the ritual is completed and the victim fails to make a successful Wisdom saving throw (or the victim chooses not to make one), the being is transformed into an {@creature avatar of Molech|DM01} under your control.": "你呼唤炉神摩利克的黑暗祝福。在午夜开始的一个小时的仪式中，你将一个活人献给摩利克，在受害人的额头上烙下神的符号。如果仪式完成后，受害者未能成功地进行智慧救赎（或者受害者选择不进行救赎），那么这个生命就会在你的控制下变成一个（%0%）。",
	"The avatar is 8 feet tall and appears to be made of black iron wreathed in flames. Its eyes, mouth, and a portion of its torso are cut away to show the churning fire inside that crackles with wailing voices. The avatar has all the statistics and abilities of an {@creature earth elemental}, with the following differences:": "这个化身有8英尺高，似乎是由被火焰包围的黑铁制成。它的眼睛、嘴巴和部分躯干被切开，显示出里面汹涌澎湃的火焰，并发出哀嚎的声音。这个化身拥有（%0%）的所有统计数据和能力，但有以下区别。",
	"Alignment is Neutral Evil;": "倾向于中性邪恶。",
	"Speed is 50 feet and it cannot burrow or use earth glide;": "速度为50英尺，不能钻地或使用土遁。",
	"it gains the fire form ability of a {@fire elemental, but it cannot squeeze through small spaces;": "它获得了{@火元素}的火形能力，但它不能挤过小空间。",
	"its Slam does an additional {@damage 1d10} fire damage.": "它的猛击会造成额外的{@damage 1d10}火焰伤害。",
	"This transformation lasts for 24 hours. At the end of that time, the subject returns to its normal state and takes 77 ({@dice 14d10}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw.": "这种转变持续24小时。在这段时间结束时，受试者会恢复到正常状态，并受到77({@dice 14d10})的火焰伤害，或者在成功地进行DC15宪法保护的情况下受到一半伤害。",
	"You wind your music box and call forth a piece of another plane of existence with which you are familiar, either through personal experience or intense study. The magic creates a bubble of space with a 30-foot radius within range of you and at a spot you designate. The portion of your plane that's inside the bubble swaps places with a corresponding portion of the plane your music box is attuned with.": "你给你的音乐盒上发条，召唤出你熟悉的另一个世界的一个片段，无论是通过个人经验还是深入研究。这个魔法会在你的范围内和你指定的地点创造一个半径为30英尺的空间泡泡。在气泡内的你的平面部分与你的音乐盒所调和的平面的相应部分互换位置。",
	"There is a {@chance 10|10% chance} that the portion of the plane you summon arrives with native creatures on it. Inanimate objects and non-ambulatory life (like trees) are cut of at the edge of the bubble, while living creatures that don't fit inside the bubble are shunted outside of it before the swap occurs. Otherwise, creatures from both planes that are caught inside the bubble are sent along with their chunk of reality to the other plane for the duration of the spell unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast; with a successful save, a creature can choose whether to shit planes with the bubble or leap outside of it a moment before the shit occurs.": "有一个{@chance 10|10% chance}你召唤的那部分飞机到达时，上面有本土生物。无生命的物体和不能行走的生命（如树木）会在气泡的边缘被切断，而不适合在气泡内的生物会在交换发生前被分流到气泡外。否则，在咒语的持续时间内，被卷入气泡内的两个位面的生物都会和他们的现实块一起被送到另一个位面，除非他们在施法时成功地进行了魅力救赎；如果救赎成功，生物可以选择是和气泡一起拉出位面还是在拉出位面的前一刻跃出位面。",
	"Any natural reaction between the two planes occurs normally (fire spreads, water glows, etc.) while energy (such as necrotic energy) leaks slowly across the edge of the sphere (no more than a foot or two per hour). Otherwise, creatures and effects can move freely across the boundary of the sphere; for the duration of the spell, it becomes a part of its new location to the fullest extent possible, given the natures of the two planes. The two displaced bubbles shift back to their original places automatically after 24 hours.": "两个位面之间的任何自然反应都会正常发生（火会蔓延，水会发光，等等），而能量（比如坏死能量）会缓慢地从球体的边缘泄漏（每小时不超过一两英尺）。否则，生物和效果可以在球体的边界上自由移动；在咒语的持续时间内，鉴于两个位面的性质，它尽可能地成为其新位置的一部分。两个移位的气泡在24小时后自动移回原处。",
	"Note that the amount of preparation involved (acquiring and attuning the music box) precludes this spell from being cast on the spur of the moment. Because of its unpredictable and potentially wide-ranging effect, it's also advisable to discuss your interest in this spell with your GM before adding it to your character's repertoire.": "请注意，所涉及的大量准备工作（获取和调整音乐盒）使这个咒语无法在一时之间施展。由于其不可预测和潜在的广泛影响，建议你在将其加入你的角色剧目之前与你的GM讨论你对这个法术的兴趣。",
	"You cause a targeted piece of clockwork to speed up past the point of control for the duration of the spell. The targeted clockwork can't cast spells with verbal components or even communicate effectively (all its utterances sound like grinding gears). At the start of each of its turns, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the clockwork moves at three times its normal speed in a random direction and then its turn ends; it can't perform any other actions. If the saving throw succeeds, then until the end of its turn, the clockwork's speed is doubled and it gains an additional action, which must be {@action Attack} (one weapon attack only), {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, {@action Hide}, or {@action Use an Object}. Then the spell ends, the clockwork takes {@dice 2d8} force damage.": "你使一个目标的发条在咒语的持续时间内加速超过控制点。目标发条不能施展带有语言成分的法术，甚至不能有效地交流（它所有的话语听起来都像磨碎的齿轮）。在它的每个回合开始时，目标必须做一个智慧储蓄动作。如果蓄力失败，发条会以其正常速度的三倍向一个随机方向移动，然后它的回合结束；它不能执行任何其他动作。如果蓄力成功，那么直到它的回合结束，发条的速度会增加一倍，并且获得一个额外的行动，这个行动必须是{@action Attack}（仅限一次武器攻击）、{@action Dash}、{@action Disengage}、{@action Hide}或{@action Use an Object}。然后咒语结束，发条受到{@dice 2d8}力量伤害。",
	"You give the target creature a degree of regularity in its motions and fortunes. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, then for the duration of the spell it doesn't make d20 die rolls but instead follows the sequence 20, 1, 19, 2, 18, 3, 17, 4, and so on.": "你让目标生物的行动和命运有一定程度的规律性。如果目标生物的智慧救赎失败，那么在咒语的持续时间内，它不会进行d20的掷骰子，而是按照20、1、19、2、18、3、17、4的顺序进行，以此类推。",

The construct regains all of its lost hit points, all negative conditions on the construct end, and it can use a reaction to stand up, if it was {@condition prone}.": "你说出一个力量之语，能量就会冲刷你所接触的单一构造体。构造体恢复了它失去的所有命中率，构造体上的所有负面状况都结束了，并且它可以使用反应来站起来，如果它原来是（%0%）的话。",

	"You create a robe of metal shards, gears, and cogs that provides a base AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. As a bonus action while protected by a robe of shards, you can command bits of metal from a fallen foe to be absorbed by your robe; each infusion of metal increases your AC by 1, to a maximum of 18 + Dexterity modifier. You can also use a bonus action to dispel the robe, causing it to explode into a shower of lying metal that does {@dice 8d6} slashing damage, +{@dice 1d6} per point of basic (non-Dexterity) AC above 14, to all creatures within 30 feet of you.": "你创造了一件由金属碎片、齿轮和齿轮组成的长袍，提供了一个14+你的灵巧修饰的基本攻击力。在受到金属碎片长袍保护的情况下，作为一个额外的行动，你可以命令从一个倒下的敌人身上取下金属碎片被你的长袍吸收；每次注入的金属都会使你的攻击力增加1，最高为18+灵巧修正值。你也可以使用一个额外的动作来驱散长袍，使其爆炸成一阵金属碎片，对你周围30英尺内的所有生物造成{@dice 8d6}的切割伤害，+{@dice 1d6}每点基本（非灵巧）AC超过14。",

	"You target a creature within 60 feet and tell it to spin. The creature can resist this command with a successful Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature spins in place for the duration of the spell. A spinning creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect with a success. A creature that has spun for 1 round or more becomes dizzy and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until one round after it stops spinning.": "你的目标是60英尺内的一个生物，并告诉它旋转。该生物可以用成功的智慧投掷来抵制这个命令。如果蓄力失败，该生物会在咒语的持续时间内原地旋转。一个旋转中的生物在它的每个回合结束时都会重复智慧救赎，如果成功则结束该效果。一个已经旋转了1轮或更多的生物会变得头晕目眩，并且在攻击卷和能力检查中处于劣势，直到它停止旋转后的1轮。",
	"You unleash a burst of superheated steam in a 15-foot radius centered on you. All other creatures in that area take {@dice 5d8} fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.

Rava, the Goddess of Gears, is but one example of this type of being; Zurvan, the Iron Angel, is another, and in the infinity of worlds there are countless more.": "在这个伟大的装置中，除了它自己，也许还有它的对手，其他人都不清楚你的位置。它的知识很丰富，与它对计划变化的容忍度成反比。它可能会要求你执行你的土地的秩序，追捕违背誓言的人，清除那些有罪的人，或者以凡人无法理解的方式对宇宙秩序进行调整。拉瓦，齿轮女神，只是这种类型的存在的一个例子；祖尔万，铁天使，是另一个例子，而在无限的世界中，还有无数的例子。",
	"The Great Machine lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.": "大机器让你在学习术士法术时从扩大的法术列表中进行选择。以下的法术会被添加到术士法术列表中，供你使用。",
	"At 1st level, your patron grants you a tiny fraction of its ability to measure and control time. At the beginning of another creature's turn (friend or enemy), before that creature moves or takes any action, you can shift your position in the initiative order to immediately before that creature. If you haven't yet taken your turn this round, you do so immediately. If you have already acted this round, you can either move or take one action immediately, but not both. In either case, your spot in the initiative order shifts to this new position. You must complete a short or long rest before using this feature again.": "一级时，你的守护者赋予你一小部分测量和控制时间的能力。在另一个生物（朋友或敌人）的回合开始时，在该生物移动或采取任何行动之前，你可以将你在主动权顺序中的位置转移到该生物之前。如果你本轮还没有采取你的行动，你就立即采取行动。如果你本轮已经行动了，你可以立即移动或采取一个行动，但不能同时进行。在任何一种情况下，你在主动权顺序中的位置都会转移到这个新位置。在再次使用此功能之前，你必须完成一次短期或长期休息。",
	"The Great Machine grants a clockwork familiar instead of a familiar of the normal kind. See the {@class wizard|phb|Clockwork Mage|Clockwork|DM01} for more information.": "伟大的机器授予一个发条熟悉的人，而不是一个普通的熟悉的人。更多信息见{@class wizard|phb|Clockwork Mage|Clockwork|DM01}。",
	"The blade of the Great Machine is a thing of clockwork and gears, changing shape as it unfolds for combat.": "大机器的刀片是一个由发条和齿轮组成的东西，在战斗中展开时改变形状。",
	"The Great Machine grants no simple book, but instead a pocket-sized device filled with cogs covered in arcane script. The warlock knows how to manipulate the small buttons and levers on the device to cast each of the cantrips. If spells are added to it via the {@optfeature Book of Ancient Secrets} invocation, the Warlock can add new gears instead of pages by the process described.": "大机器授予的不是简单的书，而是一个口袋大小的装置，里面装满了写满奥秘文字的齿轮。术士知道如何操纵设备上的小按钮和杠杆来施展每个咒语。如果通过{@optfeature Book of Ancient Secrets}调用将法术添加到其中，术士可以通过所述过程添加新的齿轮而不是页面。",
	"At 6th level, you can call on your patron to grant you uncanny precision. When you miss with an attack in combat, you can choose to reroll the attack with advantage. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.": "在6级时，你可以呼唤你的守护者给予你不可思议的精确度。当你在战斗中攻击失误时，你可以选择以优势重新进行攻击。一旦你使用这个功能，你必须在再次使用它之前完成一个短暂或长时间的休息。",
	"At 10th level, your thoughts become mechanical and ordered like that of your patron, even if your actions do not. You are immune to psychic damage and your thoughts cannot be read unless you choose to allow it.": "在10级时，你的思想变得像你的守护者一样机械而有序，即使你的行动并不如此。你对精神伤害免疫，你的思想不能被读取，除非你选择允许。",
	"The mortal mind is not meant to understand the vast complexity of machine intelligences. Starting at 14th level, you can, as an action, designate a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If it fails, it experiences a taste of your patron's mind and its place in the great plan of the multiverse. The creature takes {@dice 10d10} psychic damage and must make another Charisma saving throw; if the second saving throw; if the second saving throw fails, the creature is also {@condition stunned} for 1 minute as it reels from the experience. After using this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.": "凡人的思想并不意味着能够理解机器智能的巨大复杂性。从14级开始，你可以作为一个行动，指定一个你能看到的60英尺内的生物。它必须对你的术士法术救赎DC做一个魅力救赎。如果它失败了，它就会体验到你守护者的思想以及它在多元宇宙的伟大计划中的地位。该生物会受到（%0%）的精神伤害，并且必须再次进行魅力救赎；如果第二次救赎失败，该生物也会在1分钟内受到（%1%）的体验。使用此功能后，你必须完成一个短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",
	"The school of clockwork magic is a blending of technology and magic not often seen. While some would argue that all spells of this so-called school are simply applications of the more traditionally acknowledged branches of arcane magic, the clockwork mages understand that there is qualitative difference in thought between casting, say, a clockwork (evocation) spell and an ordinary evocation. The school thrives alongside industry, using a small number of spells, compared to the older schools, to create a wide range of styles. Fool is he who fails to notice arcane glyphs and wands and mistakes a clockwork mage for a common gear grinder or tinkerer.": "钟表魔法学派是一种不常见的技术和魔法的混合体。虽然有些人认为这个所谓的学派的所有法术都只是应用了更多传统上公认的奥术分支，但发条法师们明白，在施展，比如说发条（唤醒）法术和普通唤醒法之间，存在着思想上的质的区别。该流派与工业一起繁荣发展，与老牌流派相比，他们使用少量的法术，创造出多种风格。没有注意到奥术石刻和魔杖并将发条法师误认为普通齿轮研磨机或工匠的人是傻瓜。",
	"Clockwork mages who use the spell {@spell find familiar} (or others who gain access to the spell and chose to use it) substitute the material components for a small clockwork device in the form of an animal similar to those listed in the text of the spell. When the ritual is completed, magical animating force gives life to the device. The delicacy of the clockwork makes up for any superior durability of the materials. It has the statistics of the chosen form but is a construct instead of a beast. Unlike a normal familiar, the devices' form cannot be changed without investing in the material components to rebuild it. The familiar is never counted when determining the number of constructs a mage can control.": "使用该咒语的发条法师（%0%）（或其他获得该咒语并选择使用它的人）将物质成分替换成一个小型的发条装置，其形式与咒语文本中所列的动物相似。仪式完成后，神奇的灵力会赋予这个装置以生命。钟表的精致程度弥补了材料的卓越耐久性。它具有所选择的形式的统计数据，但它是一个构造体，而不是一个野兽。与普通的熟悉者不同，如果不投资材料组件来重建它，装置的形式就不能改变。在确定法师可以控制的构装体数量时，熟悉的东西永远不会被计算在内。",
	"Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time it takes to copy a clockwork spell into your spell book is halved.": "从你在2级时选择这个流派开始，将发条咒语复制到你的法术书中所需的金币和时间减半。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast an {@spell animate construct|DM01} spell, increase the duration by a number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus. At 20th level, you can make the spell permanent until dispelled but cannot have more than one made permanent at a time.": "从2级开始，每当你施放一个（%0%）的法术时，持续时间会增加相当于你的熟练度加成的分钟数。在20级时，你可以使咒语永久化，直到被驱散，但一次不能有超过一个永久化的咒语。",
	"When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to reshape metal with a touch. When you grasp a piece of metal of Small size or smaller, you can alter its form into any shape that suits your purpose. The item must be in your hands and under your control; you can't, for example, reshape a piece of armor or a weapon that's being worn or wielded by someone else. To create a specific object, such as a key or mechanical component, you must be completely familiar with it. Thus you could replicate a key that you had in your possession for an extended period of time, but you could not create a working key based on seeing the lock alone.": "当你达到6级时，你获得了用触摸重塑金属的能力。当你抓住一块小尺寸或更小的金属时，你可以把它的形状改变成任何适合你的目的的形状。该物品必须在你的手中，并且在你的控制之下；例如，你不能重塑一件盔甲或别人正在穿戴或挥舞的武器。要创造一个特定的物体，如钥匙或机械部件，你必须对它完全熟悉。因此，你可以复制一把你拥有了很长时间的钥匙，但你不可能仅凭看到锁就创造出一把能用的钥匙。",
	"Objects you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail is not possible. This effect can be used to {@spell repair metal|DM01} as per the spell. You may use this feature once before completing a long or short rest.": "你创造的物体最多可以有两个铰链和一个门闩，但更精细的机械细节是不可能的。这个效果可以按照法术的要求使用到（%0%）。你可以在完成一个长或短的休息之前使用这个功能一次。",
	"Beginning at 10th level, you can transform yourself as an action into a living construct for up to 1 minute per level. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma and the ability to speak and cast spells. You can transform into a {@filter golem|bestiary|search=golem} or clockwork creature whose CR is less than or equal to your current level in this class. Otherwise, this ability functions as the {@class druid|phb|druid's Wild Shape} ability.": "从10级开始，你可以通过行动将自己变成一个活体，每级最多1分钟。你保留你的智力、智慧和魅力，以及说话和施法的能力。你可以变身为一个CR值小于或等于你当前等级的（%0%）或发条生物。否则，这个能力的功能与（%1%）的能力一样。",
	"Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring constructs under your control. As an action, you can compel one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. This is a magical effect. If the saving throw fails, the construct becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands for 1 hour, until you use this ability again, or until it takes damage from you or one of your allies. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the duration is extended to 6 hours or until one of the other conditions is fulfilled. When the effect ends, the construct is aware it was controlled by you.": "从14级开始，你可以使用魔法将建筑体置于你的控制之下。作为一个行动，你可以强迫60英尺范围内你能看到的一个生物对你的巫师法术救赎DC进行智力测验。这是一个神奇的效果。如果救赎失败，该生物会变得对你友好并服从你的命令，持续1小时，直到你再次使用这个能力，或者直到它受到你或你的盟友的伤害。如果蓄力失败5次或更多，持续时间会延长到6小时，或者直到其他条件之一得到满足。当效果结束时，构造物会意识到它是被你控制的。"
