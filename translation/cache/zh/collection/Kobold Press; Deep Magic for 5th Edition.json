Instead of making the usual saving throw against the poison, each creature around you makes a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect from the poison and is immune to further castings of {@italic doom of serpent coils} for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn't suffer the poison's usual effect; instead, it takes {@damage 4d6} poison damage and is {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes {@damage 4d6} poison damage and is still {@condition poisoned}. On a subsequent successful save, it is no longer {@condition poisoned} and is immune to further {@italic castings of doom of serpent coils} for 24 hours.": "你喝下一剂毒液或其他毒药，并将其效果传播给你周围的其他生物。如果该毒药通常允许救赎，你的救赎自动失败。在将毒药传播给你周围10英尺内的所有其他生物之前，你会正常承受毒药的影响。你周围的每个生物不需要对毒药进行通常的蓄力，而是对咒语进行宪法蓄力。拯救成功时，目标不会受到毒药的伤害或其他影响，并在24小时内对（%0%）的进一步施放免疫。如果救治失败，目标不会受到毒药的通常效果，相反，它会受到{@damage 4d6}的毒药伤害，并被{@condition poisoned}。当{@condition poisoned}以这种方式存在时，一个生物在它的每个回合结束时都会重复拯救动作。在随后的救赎失败时，它将受到（%4%）的毒药伤害，并且仍然是（%5%）。在随后的救赎成功时，它不再是{@condition poisoned}，并且在24小时内对{@italic castings of doom of serpent coils}免疫。",
	"Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect on creatures that are already {@condition poisoned} by it. The effect can be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.": "多次施放此法术对已经被其影响的生物没有额外的效果，（%0%）。该效果可以通过防毒或类似的魔法结束。",
	"This spell is cast on a melee weapon. The next time that weapon is used, it destroys the target's nonmagical shield or damages nonmagical armor, in addition to the normal effect of the attack. If the foe is using a nonmagical shield, it breaks into pieces. If the foe doesn't use a shield, its nonmagical armor takes a -2 penalty to AC. If the target doesn't use armor or a shield, the spell is expended with no effect.": "这个咒语是对一个近战武器施放的。下次使用该武器时，除了攻击的正常效果外，还会破坏目标的非魔法盾牌或损坏非魔法盔甲。如果敌人使用的是非魔法盾牌，它会碎裂成碎片。如果敌人没有使用盾牌，它的非魔法盔甲对AC值有一个-2的惩罚。如果目标没有使用盔甲或盾牌，则该法术被消耗，没有任何效果。",
	"The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate turns into filthy and slippery muck. This spell affects sand, earth, mud, and ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the mud until the spell ends.

A creature that frees itself or that enters the area after the spell was cast is affected by the difficult terrain but doesn't become {@condition restrained}.": "在你指定的点的30英尺范围内的地面会变成污秽和滑溜的泥土。这个法术会影响沙子、土、泥和冰，但不会影响石头、木头或其他材料。在持续时间内，受影响区域的地面为困难地形。当你施法时，在该区域的生物必须成功地进行力量救赎，否则就会被泥土所困，直到法术结束。一个{@condition restrained}的生物可以通过使用一个行动来做一个成功的力量救赎动作来释放自己。释放自己的生物或在施法后进入该区域的生物会受到困难地形的影响，但不会变成（%2%）。",
	"Each round, a {@condition restrained} creature sinks deeper into the muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is {@condition restrained} for 3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds. Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren't holding their breath. A creature that is still submerged when the spell ends is sealed beneath the newly solidified ground.

	"You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.": "你创造了一个黑暗能量的涟漪，摧毁了它所接触的一切。一个半径为10英尺、深为10英尺的圆柱形超维洞出现在一个足够大的水平面上。由于它延伸到了另一个维度，这个坑没有重量，也不会取代原来的底层材料。你可以在一艘船的甲板上创造这个坑，就像在地牢的地板或森林的地面上一样容易。",
	"The pit's radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. ": "坑的半径在你每回合开始时扩大10英尺，持续期间。任何站在原来的魔法空间里的生物，或者站在坑扩大后所占据的空间里的生物，都必须成功地进行灵巧反射，以避免掉入坑中。当坑扩大时，任何与之相邻的生物都必须同样成功地进行灵巧救赎，以避免掉入坑中。受到成功的推挤效果的生物（例如由阵风之类的法术）可能不会做这个蓄力动作。掉进坑里的生物会受到正常的坠落伤害。",

	"This spell covers a 20-foot-by-20-foot section of wall or floor within range with a thin coating of grease. If a vertical surface is affected, each climber on that surface must make a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check or immediately fall from the surface unless it is held in place by ropes or other climbing gear. A creature standing on an affected floor falls {@condition prone} unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that try to climb or move through the affected area can move no faster than half speed (this is cumulative with the usual reduction for climbing), and any movement must be followed by a Strength saving throw (for climbing) or a Dexterity saving throw (for walking).

	"You grant a touched creature a limited gift of luck. While the spell lasts, the target can gain advantage on any three rolls of its choice. Once three rolls have been affected, the spell ends.": "你给予一个被触及的生物一个有限的幸运礼物。在咒语持续期间，目标可以在其选择的任何三个卷轴中获得优势。一旦有三次滚动受到影响，咒语就会结束。",
	"A willing creature you touch has advantage on the first three death saving throws it attempts before the duration of the spell expires.": "你所接触到的自愿的生物在法术持续时间结束前，在它所尝试的前三次死亡拯救中具有优势。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th, 6th, or 7th level, the maximum duration increases to 48 hours.

	"Your magic protects the target creature from the life-sapping energies of the undead. For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a {@creature shadow}'s Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a {@creature specter}'s Life Drain. This spell doesn't prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.": "你的魔法可以保护目标生物免受亡灵能量的侵蚀。在持续时间内，目标对来自亡灵生物的减少其能力分数的效果有免疫力，例如{@creature shadow}的力量消耗，或其最大命中率，例如{@creature specter}的生命耗尽。这个法术并不能阻止这些攻击的伤害，它只能阻止能力值或最大命中率的降低。",
	"You lay a glamer upon a touched creature that makes it easily overlooked and forgettable. For the duration of the spell, any Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the target, or any ability checks made to recall details about the target or any interactions with it, are made with disadvantage. The target gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, but has disadvantage on any Charisma checks made while under the glamer.": "你在被触及的生物身上涂上一层光晕，使其容易被忽视和遗忘。在咒语的持续时间内，任何注意目标的智慧（感知）检查，或任何回忆目标细节或与之互动的能力检查，都是以劣势进行的。目标在灵巧（隐身）检查中获得优势，但在被冰封的情况下，任何魅力检查都是劣势。",
	"Provided you're not carrying more of a load than your carrying capacity permits, you can walk on the surface of snow rather than wading through it, and you ignore its effect on movement. Ice supports your weight no matter how thin it is, and you can travel on ice as if you were wearing ice skates. You still leave tracks normally while under these effects.": "只要你的负荷没有超过你的承载能力所允许的范围，你就可以在雪的表面行走，而不是涉水而过，而且你忽略了它对运动的影响。无论冰有多薄，它都能支撑你的重量，你可以在冰上行走，就像你穿着冰鞋一样。在这些影响下，你仍然会正常地留下足迹。",

	"When you cast this spell, you erect a barrier of energy drawn from the realm of death and shadow. This barrier is a wall 20 feet high and 60 feet long, or a ring 20 feet high and 20 feet in diameter. The wall is transparent when viewed from one side of your choice and translucent—lightly obscuring the area beyond it—from the other. A creature that tries to move through the wall must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or stop in front of the wall and become {@condition frightened} until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can try again to move through. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against the wall, it is immune to the effect of this barrier.": "当你施展这个法术时，你会竖起一道从死亡和阴影领域汲取的能量屏障。这个屏障是一堵高20英尺、长60英尺的墙，或者一个高20英尺、直径20英尺的环。从你选择的一面看，这堵墙是透明的，而从另一面看，则是半透明的--轻度遮蔽了墙外的区域。试图穿过墙壁的生物必须做一个成功的智慧救赎，否则就会停在墙壁前面，并变得（%0%），直到该生物的下一个回合开始时，它可以再次尝试穿过。一旦一个生物对墙做了一个成功的蓄力动作，它就对这个屏障的效果免疫。",
	"You create a hidden glyph by tracing it on a surface or object that you touch. When you cast the spell, you can also choose a location that's known to you, within 5 miles, and on the same plane of existence, to serve as the destination for the glyph's shifting effect.": "你通过在你触摸的表面或物体上描画它来创造一个隐藏的字形。当你施法时，你也可以选择一个你所知道的、在5英里范围内、在同一存在平面上的地点，作为石刻转移效果的目的地。",
	"The glyph is triggered when it's touched by a creature that's not aware of its presence.

	"A creature you touch traverses craggy slopes with the surefootedness of a mountain goat. When ascending a slope that would normally be difficult terrain for it, the target can move at its full speed instead. The target also gains a +2 bonus on Dexterity checks and saving throws to prevent falling, to catch a ledge or otherwise stop a fall, or to move along a narrow ledge.": "你所接触的生物能以山羊般稳健的脚步穿越陡峭的斜坡。当登上一个对它来说通常是困难地形的斜坡时，目标可以用它的全速移动。目标还能在灵巧检查和蓄力动作上获得+2的奖励，以防止跌倒，抓住壁架或以其他方式阻止跌倒，或者沿着狭窄的壁架移动。",

	"You make natural terrain in a 1-mile cube difficult to traverse. A creature in the affected area has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks or travel safely through the area, as paths through the terrain seem to twist and turn nonsensically. The terrain itself isn't changed, only the perception of those inside it. A creature that succeeds on two Wisdom (Survival) checks while in the terrain discerns the illusion for what it is and sees the illusory twists and turns superimposed on the terrain. A creature that reenters the area after exiting it before the spell ends is affected by the spell even if it previously succeeded in traversing the terrain. A creature with truesight can see through the illusion and is unaffected by the spell. A creature that casts {@spell find the path} automatically succeeds in discovering a way out of the terrain.": "你使1英里范围内的自然地形变得难以穿越。受影响区域内的生物在智慧（生存）检查中处于劣势，无法追踪足迹或安全通过该区域，因为通过该地形的路径似乎是扭曲的、无意义的。地形本身并没有改变，只是里面的人的感知发生了变化。在地形中的生物，如果两次智慧（生存）检查成功，就能分辨出这是什么幻觉，并看到叠加在地形上的虚幻的扭曲和转弯。在咒语结束前退出该区域后重新进入该区域的生物会受到该咒语的影响，即使它之前成功穿越了该地形。拥有真实视力的生物可以看穿幻象，并且不受法术的影响。施放{@spell find the path}的生物会自动成功发现离开地形的方法。",
	"When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the word as it enters the area automatically sees the illusion and is unaffected by the spell. ": "当你施展这个法术时，你可以指定一个密码。在进入该区域时说出这个词的生物会自动看到这个幻象，并且不受法术的影响。",
	"If you cast this spell on the same spot every day for one year, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.": "如果你在一年内每天在同一地点施展这个咒语，这个幻觉会持续到它被驱散。",
	"You create an intoxicating aroma that fills the area within 30 feet of a point you can see within range. Creatures in this area smell something they find so pleasing that it's distracting. Each creature in the area that makes an attack roll must first make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the attack is made with disadvantage. Only a creature's first attack in a round is affected this way; subsequent attacks are resolved normally. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to the effect of this particular scent, but they can be affected again by a new casting of the spell.": "你创造一种令人陶醉的香气，充斥在你能看到的范围内30英尺的区域。这个区域内的生物会闻到它们觉得很愉悦的气味，以至于让它们分心。该区域内的每个生物在进行攻击时必须先进行智慧救赎，如果救赎失败，则攻击将以劣势进行。只有生物在一个回合中的第一次攻击会受到这种影响；随后的攻击会正常解决。拯救成功后，生物会对这种特殊气味的影响产生免疫，但他们可以通过新的法术施放再次受到影响。",

	"This spell functions only against an arcane or divine spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If you make a successful melee attack against such a creature before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that attack, the target takes {@damage 2d4} necrotic damage and one or more of the victim's available spell slots are transferred to you, to be used as your own. Roll a {@dice d6}; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest possible level are transferred before lower-level slots.

	"If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then this spell has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage.

	"You take on the physical characteristics of the terrain around you. In a forest, grass and tiny mushrooms sprout in your hair, moss beards your chin, and your flesh takes on the mottled hue of leaf green and bark brown. In an arctic grassland, gray lichens and the various shades of boreal grasses cloak your presence. This effect provides a +2 bonus to Stealth checks in the appropriate terrain.": "你会呈现出你周围地形的物理特征。在森林里，草和小蘑菇在你的头发上发芽，苔藓在你的下巴上长出胡子，你的肉体呈现出叶绿和树皮棕色的斑驳色调。在北极草原上，灰色地衣和各种色调的北极草掩盖了你的存在。在相应的地形中，该效果为隐身检查提供+2的奖励。",

	"You infuse the metal of a melee weapon you touch with the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon's wielder has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition, an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and is struck by the weapon must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be {@condition stunned} for 1 round. If the creature has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon's wielder currently has, it becomes {@condition frightened} instead; a {@condition frightened} creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to castings of this spell on the same weapon for 24 hours.": "你为你接触的近战武器的金属注入强大的英雄的可怕光环。武器持有者在积极挥舞武器时，对魅力（恐吓）的检查具有优势。此外，目前拥有30点或更少命中率的对手，如果被武器击中，必须成功地进行魅力救赎，否则会在1个回合内受到（%0%）的伤害。如果该生物拥有超过30点的命中率，但少于武器持有者目前拥有的命中率，它就会变成{@condition frightened}；{@condition frightened}的生物在其每个回合结束时重复蓄力，在蓄力成功时结束对其的影响。蓄力成功的生物在24小时内对同一武器上的此法术的施放免疫。",

Creatures slain in the affected area cannot be raised as undead by magic or by the abilities of monsters, even if the corpse is later removed from the area.

Such spells cast with spell slots of 5th level or higher function normally.": "你召唤神力来祝福你周围60英尺内的地面。在受影响区域被杀的生物不能被魔法或怪物的能力复活为亡灵，即使后来尸体被移出该区域。任何四级或更低级的法术，如果能在该区域内召唤或激活亡灵，都会自动失败。用5级或更高等级的法术槽施展的此类法术则正常运作。",

Failing to complete the task does not incur any penalties as long as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise, leads you to forsake your vow (being {@condition charmed}, for instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if you do not break the vow).": "如果你自愿放弃你的誓言，咒语就会结束，你会受到（%0%）的精神伤害。根据GM的判断，你可能会受到其他惩罚，需要为你的决定赎罪。详情见圣骑士等级描述中的 \"违背你的誓言 \"侧栏。只要你忠实于你的誓言，未能完成任务就不会产生任何惩罚，如果某种形式的外部胁迫，不管是魔法的还是其他的，导致你放弃你的誓言（例如被{@condition charmed}，或者如果你不违背誓言，一个恶棍威胁到无辜者的生命），你也会受到惩罚。",

	"You make a camouflaged shelter nestled in the branches of a tree or among a collection of stones. The shelter is a 10-foot cube centered on a point within range. It can hold as many as nine Medium or smaller creatures. The atmosphere inside the shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

	"You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the words works on the mind of a creature that reads it, convincing the creature that there is some importance to the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance. ": "你在羊皮纸、纸张或其他合适的书写材料上写字，并给它注入强大的魔力，持续一段时间。实际上写的是什么并不重要；写在字上的魔法对阅读它的生物的思想起作用，使其相信这条信息有一定的重要性，必须加以发现。读取信息的生物必须在智慧救赎中获得成功，否则就会被强迫继续阅读和重读这些文字，试图找出其意义和重要性。",
	"During combat, a creature so enthralled it can take no actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic missive can make a new saving throw against the effects at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation.  In nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new saving throw against the effects every hour.": "在战斗中，被迷住的生物在其回合中不能采取任何行动或反应，但如果它选择或需要这样做（例如将自己从危险中移开），则可以移动。如果处于战斗状态，受催眠信物影响的生物可以在其回合开始时对其效果进行新的蓄力。 在没有威胁的情况下，该生物可以每小时对该效果进行一次新的蓄力。",

This does not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the creature reads the words again, it must make another save or fall under the spell's effects once more.": "一旦生物成功地进行了救赎，它就会认识到影响它的魔法蛊惑。然而这并不能提供对咒语的免疫力，如果该生物再次读到这些话，它必须再次进行救赎，否则就会再次受到咒语的影响。",

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the thorny vines until the spell ends.

Doing so causes the creature to take {@damage 2d6} piercing damage from the thorns. On a successful check, it frees itself.": "在你选择的目标周围，从地面上长出长满尖锐荆棘的粗大藤蔓。目标必须成功地进行力量测验，否则就会被荆棘藤蔓缠住，直到咒语结束。被藤蔓缠住的生物（1%）可以用它的行动来对你的法术救赎DC进行力量检查。这样做会使该生物受到荆棘的刺伤（%2%）。如果检定成功，它就会自行解脱。",

	"This spell doesn't function in an area affected by a {@spell silence} spell. Very brittle material such as crystal might be shattered if it's within range, at the GM's discretion; a character holding such an object can protect it from harm by making a successful Dexterity saving throw.": "这个法术在受{@spell silence}法术影响的区域内不起作用。如果水晶等非常脆的材料在范围内，可能会被击碎，由GM决定；持有这种物体的角色可以通过成功的灵巧救赎来保护它不受伤害。",

	"You make a choking motion while pointing at a target, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become unable to communicate verbally.

	"One willing creature you touch gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. This climbing speed functions only while the creature is in contact with a living plant or fungus that's growing from the ground. The creature can cling to an appropriate surface with just one hand or with just its feet, leaving its hands free to wield weapons or cast spells. The plant doesn't give under the creature's weight, so the creature can walk on the tiniest of tree branches, stand on a leaf, or run across the waving top of a field of wheat without bending a stalk or touching the ground.": "你接触到的一个自愿的生物会获得相当于其行走速度的攀爬速度。这个攀爬速度只在该生物接触到从地面生长出来的活的植物或真菌时发挥作用。该生物可以只用一只手或只用脚依附在适当的表面上，让它的手自由地挥舞武器或施展法术。植物不会因为生物的重量而屈服，所以生物可以在最细小的树枝上行走，站在一片叶子上，或者跑过挥舞的麦田顶部，而不会弯曲树枝或接触到地面。",
	"You touch a tree and ask one question about anything that might have happened in its immediate vicinity (such as \"Who passed by here?\"). You get a mental sensation of the response, which lasts for the duration of the spell. Trees do not have a humanoid's sense of time, so the tree might speak about something that happened last night or a hundred years ago. The sensation you receive might include sight, hearing, vibration, or smell, all from the tree's perspective. Trees are particularly attentive to anything that might harm the forest and always report such activities when questioned.": "你触摸一棵树，就其附近可能发生的任何事情问一个问题（如 \"谁从这里经过？\"）。你会得到一个精神上的反应，这个反应会持续到法术的持续时间。树木没有类人的时间感，所以树可能会说起昨晚或一百年前发生的事情。你收到的感觉可能包括视觉、听觉、振动或嗅觉，都是从树的角度出发。树对任何可能伤害森林的东西都特别注意，在被询问时总是报告这种活动。",

	"You tweak a strand of a creature's fate as it attempts an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Roll a {@dice d20} and subtract 10 to produce a number from 10 to–9. Add that number to the creature's roll. This adjustment can turn a failure into a success or vice versa, or it might not change the outcome at all.": "当一个生物试图进行攻击卷、蓄力或技能检查时，你会调整它的一缕命运。掷一个{@dice d20}，然后减去10，得出一个从10到9的数字。把这个数字加到该生物的卷轴上。这种调整可以把失败变成成功，反之亦然，或者根本不会改变结果。",
	"You extend a hand and point a finger at a creature within range. Your magic grants the target enhanced awareness of attacks directed at it. The next attack roll against the creature before the spell ends is made with disadvantage.": "你伸出一只手，用手指着范围内的一个生物。你的魔法使目标对针对它的攻击有更强的意识。在咒语结束前，对该生物的下一次攻击卷是以劣势进行的。",

Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.": "你使一个你能看到的60英尺范围内的石像作为你的盟友而复活。该石像具有（%0%）的统计数据。它在你的回合之后立即进行一个回合。作为你回合的额外行动，你可以命令石像移动和攻击，只要你在它的60英尺之内。如果没有你的命令，这个雕像什么都不会做。",
	"Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC 16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk.

	"Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the target for another undead creature. Typically this means the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent undead might depend on the conditions under which the encounter occurs, but if the target's presence would not be unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it acts suspiciously.": "遇到受此法术影响的亡灵时，必须对你的法术救赎DC进行智力救赎。如果救赎失败，亡灵会将目标误认为另一个亡灵生物。通常情况下，这意味着亡灵会忽略目标，特别是如果它是一个智力较低的目标，如骷髅或僵尸，除非它被命令这样做。智慧较高的亡灵的反应可能取决于遭遇的条件，但如果目标的存在并不罕见，它们也可能会忽略目标，除非它有可疑的行为。",

	"One creature of your choice within range that has natural armor must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, attacks against that creature's Armor Class are made with advantage, and the creature can't regain hit points through any means while the spell remains in effect.

	"You harness the power of fire contained in ley lines with this spell. You create a 60-foot cone of flame. Creatures in the cone take {@damage 6d6} fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. You can then flow along the flames, reappearing anywhere inside the cone's area. This repositioning doesn't count as movement and doesn't trigger opportunity attacks.": "你用这个法术驾驭雷系中的火的力量。你创造一个60英尺的火焰圆锥。处于锥体中的生物会受到{@damage 6d6}的火焰伤害，或者在灵巧救赎成功的情况下受到一半的伤害。然后你可以沿着火焰流动，重新出现在锥形区域的任何地方。这种重新定位不算是移动，也不会触发机会攻击。",

In addition, the target's firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse.

On a failed save, the creature starts to engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature's agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts.

	"A dark shadow creeps across the target's mind and leaves a small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes {@condition frightened} of you for the duration. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While {@condition frightened} in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack into a space that isn't brightly lit.

	"You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like.

	"When you touch a willing creature with a piece of charcoal while casting this spell, the target and everything it carries blends into and becomes part of the target's shadow, which remains discernible, although its body seems to disappear. The shadow is incorporeal, has no weight, and is immune to all but psychic and radiant damage. The target remains aware of its surroundings and can move, but only as a shadow could move—flowing along surfaces as if the creature were moving normally. The creature can step out of the shadow at will, resuming its physical shape in the shadow's space and ending the spell.": "当你在施展这个法术时用一块木炭接触一个愿意的生物，目标和它所携带的一切都会融入目标的影子并成为其一部分，虽然它的身体似乎消失了，但仍然可以辨别。影子是无实体的，没有重量，除了精神和辐射伤害外，对所有的伤害都免疫。目标仍然知道它周围的环境，并且可以移动，但只能像影子一样移动--沿着表面流动，就像该生物正常移动一样。该生物可以随意走出影子，在影子的空间里恢复其物理形状，并结束咒语。",
	"This spell cannot be cast in an area devoid of light, where a shadow would not normally appear. Even a faint light source, such as moonlight or starlight, is sufficient.

	"You call down a legion of shadowy soldiers in a 10-foot cube. Their features resemble a mockery of once-living creatures. Whenever a creature starts its turn inside the cube or within 5 feet of it, or enters the cube for the first time on its turn, the conjured shades make an attack using your melee spell attack modifier; on a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d8} necrotic damage.

	"With a quick glance into the future, you pinpoint where a gap is about to open in your foe's defense, and then you strike. After casting this spell, you have advantage on all attack rolls until the end of your turn.": "通过对未来的快速一瞥，你准确地找到了敌人防御中即将打开的缺口，然后你就出手了。施放此法术后，你在所有的攻击卷上都有优势，直到你的回合结束。",
	"Just in time, you call out a fortunate warning to a creature within range. The target rolls a {@dice d4} and adds the number rolled to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that it has just made and uses the new result for determining success or failure.": "正好，你对范围内的一个生物发出了幸运的警告。目标掷出一个{@dice d4}，并将掷出的数字加入它刚做的攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷，并使用新的结果来决定成功或失败。",
	"You inflict the ravages of aging on up to three creatures within range, temporarily discomfiting them and making them appear elderly for a time. Each target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment) and it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks (but not saving throws). An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "你对范围内最多三个生物施加衰老的摧残，使它们暂时失去信心，并使它们在一段时间内显得衰老。每个目标必须做一个成功的智慧救赎，否则它的行走速度会减半（四舍五入到最近的5英尺），并且在灵巧检查中处于劣势（但不是救赎）。受影响的生物可以在其每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对自己的影响。",
	"You slow the flow of time around a creature within range that you can see. The creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends, on a failed save the target's speed is halved again at the start of each of your turns. For example, if a creature with a speed of 30 feet fails its initial saving throw, its speed drops to 15 feet. At the start of your next turn, the creature's speed drops to 10 feet on a failed save, then to 5 feet on the following round on another failed save. Decelerate can't reduce a creature's speed to less than 5 feet.": "你可以在你能看到的范围内减缓一个生物周围的时间流速。该生物必须做一个成功的智慧救赎，否则其行走速度将减半（四舍五入到最近的5英尺）。该生物可以在它的每个回合结束时重复这个蓄力动作，如果成功则结束该效果。在咒语结束之前，如果救赎失败，目标的速度会在你每个回合的开始时再次减半。例如，如果一个速度为30英尺的生物在最初的救赎中失败，它的速度会下降到15英尺。在你的下一个回合开始时，如果救赎失败，该生物的速度会下降到10英尺，然后在下一个回合，如果再次救赎失败，则下降到5英尺。减速术不能将生物的速度降低到5英尺以下。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect an additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.": "当你使用3级或更高等级的法术槽施放此法术时，每超过2级的法术槽等级，你可以影响一个额外的生物。",
	"You or a creature that you touch can see a few seconds into the future. When the spell is cast, each other creature within 30 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail must declare, in initiative order, what their next action will be. The target of the spell declares his or her action last, after hearing what all other creatures will do. Each creature that declared an action must follow its declaration as closely as possible when its turn comes. For the duration of the spell, the target has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and creatures that declared their actions have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.": "你或你接触的生物可以看到几秒钟的未来。当施法时，在目标30英尺范围内的其他生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作。那些失败的人必须按照主动权的顺序宣布他们的下一步行动。咒语的目标在听到所有其他生物将做什么之后，最后宣布他或她的行动。每个宣布行动的生物在轮到自己时必须尽可能地遵循其声明。在咒语的持续时间内，目标在攻击卷、能力检查和蓄力投掷方面具有优势，而宣布行动的生物在对目标的攻击卷上具有劣势。",
	"Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is available within 10 feet of you. It doesn't matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you're able to move (not {@condition restrained} or {@condition grappled} or reduced to a speed of less than 10 feet for any other reason). This move doesn't count as part of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you're not hidden.": "由于你的预知能力，你清楚地知道你的敌人何时会把目光从你身上移开。施放这个法术的效果与成功进行灵巧（隐身）检查相同，只要你周围10英尺内有遮蔽物或隐蔽物。当你施法时，敌人是否能看到你并不重要；他们会在适当的时候瞥开。作为施法的一部分，你最多可以移动10英尺，只要你能够移动（不是{@condition restrained}或{@condition grappled}或因任何其他原因而降低到10英尺以下的速度）。这个移动不算作你正常移动的一部分。在施法后，你必须处于一个你可以保持隐蔽的位置：例如一个轻度遮蔽的空间，或者一个你有完全遮蔽物的空间。否则，敌人会立即再次看到你，而你也不会被隐藏。",
	"You touch one willing creature. Once before the duration of the spell expires, the target can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to an initiative roll or Dexterity saving throw it has just made. The spell then ends.": "你接触一个愿意的生物。在法术持续时间结束前，目标可以掷出一个（%0%），并将掷出的数字加到它刚做的主动性掷骰或灵巧性救赎上。然后法术结束。",
	"You make one living creature or plant within range move rapidly in time compared to you. The target becomes one year older. For example, you could cast this spell on a seedling, which causes the plant to sprout from the soil, or you could cast this spell on a newly hatched duckling, causing it to become a full-grown duck. If the target is a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the aging. It can choose to fail the saving throw.": "你使范围内的一个生物或植物与你相比在时间上快速移动。目标会变老一岁。例如，你可以对一棵幼苗施展这个法术，使植物从土壤中发芽，或者你可以对一只新孵化的小鸭子施展这个法术，使它变成一只成年的鸭子。如果目标是智力值为3或更高的生物，它必须成功地进行体质救赎以抵抗衰老。它可以选择失败。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the target's age by one additional year for each slot level above 4th.": "当你使用5级以上的法术槽施展此法术时，你的法术槽等级每超过4级，目标的年龄就会额外增加一岁。",
	"You accelerate the aging of one creature within range, causing it to take on the state of a decrepit version of its type. The target suffers three levels of {@condition exhaustion} that cannot be removed by normal means. A {@spell greater restoration} spell partially reverses the effect of this spell, removing one level of {@condition exhaustion}. Constructs and undead are unaffected by this spell, and creatures who live to great age without negative effects, such as dragons, are also unaffected.": "你加速了范围内一个生物的衰老，使其呈现出其类型的衰弱版本的状态。目标遭受三层{@condition exhaustion}的伤害，无法通过正常手段消除。一个{@spell greater restoration}的法术可以部分逆转这个法术的效果，消除一个{@condition exhaustion}的等级。构造物和亡灵不受此法术影响，活到很大年纪而没有负面影响的生物，如龙，也不受影响。",
	"Choose up to four creatures within range. If a target is your ally, it can reroll initiative, keeping whichever of the two results it prefers. If a target is your enemy, it must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or reroll initiative, keeping whichever of the two results you prefer. Changes to the initiative order go into effect at the start of the next round.": "选择范围内最多四个生物。如果目标是你的盟友，它可以重选主动权，保留它喜欢的两个结果中的一个。如果目标是你的敌人，它必须做一个成功的智慧救赎，或者重新进行主动攻击，保留你喜欢的两个结果中的任何一个。对主动权顺序的改变在下一回合开始时生效。",
	"You subtly warp the flow of space and time to enhance your conjurations with cosmic potency.

	"You foresee your foe's strike a split second before it occurs. When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat.": "你在你的敌人的攻击发生前的一瞬间预见到它。当你成功地施展这个法术时，你也会指定一些能看到或听到你的盟友，其数量等于你的法术能力修饰+你的熟练度奖励。这些盟友也不会被攻击吓到，并且可以在第一轮战斗中正常行动。",

On a failed check, you are surprised and can't use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.": "如果你会被吓到，你必须在你的反应被触发的那一刻用你的法术能力做一个检查。检查DC等于当前的主动权数。如果检定失败，你会被吓到，并且在你下一个回合之前不能使用你的反应来施展这个法术。检验成功时，你可以立即使用你的反应来施展这个法术。",
	"Your foreknowledge allows you to act before others, because you knew what was going to happen. When you cast this spell, make a new initiative roll with a +5 bonus.

	"When you cast this spell, you step outside the normal time stream, seeming to vanish as 1 round of time passes. You can make minor alterations to the scene being played out, becoming visible for an instant each time you make an adjustment that aids an ally or hinders foes.

You cannot be attacked by any means while under the effect of this spell.": "当你施展这个法术时，你会跳出正常的时间流，在1轮时间过去后似乎消失了。你可以对正在上演的场景进行微小的改变，每次你做出有助于盟友或阻碍敌人的调整时，你都会在一瞬间变得可见。对其他人来说，你在施法时就会消失，然后在下一回合中忽隐忽现，然后在1回合后重新出现在你消失的地方，这时法术结束。在这个法术的作用下，你不能通过任何方式被攻击。",
