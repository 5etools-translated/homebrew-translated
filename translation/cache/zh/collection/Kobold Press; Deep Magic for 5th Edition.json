Instead of making the usual saving throw against the poison, each creature around you makes a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a successful save, a target suffers no damage or other effect from the poison and is immune to further castings of {@italic doom of serpent coils} for 24 hours. On a failed save, a target doesn't suffer the poison's usual effect; instead, it takes {@damage 4d6} poison damage and is {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a subsequent failed save, it takes {@damage 4d6} poison damage and is still {@condition poisoned}. On a subsequent successful save, it is no longer {@condition poisoned} and is immune to further {@italic castings of doom of serpent coils} for 24 hours.": "你喝下一剂毒液或其他毒药，并将其效果传播给你周围的其他生物。如果该毒药通常允许救赎，你的救赎自动失败。在将毒药传播给你周围10英尺内的所有其他生物之前，你会正常承受毒药的影响。你周围的每个生物不需要对毒药进行通常的蓄力，而是对咒语进行宪法蓄力。拯救成功时，目标不会受到毒药的伤害或其他影响，并在24小时内对（%0%）的进一步施放免疫。如果救治失败，目标不会受到毒药的通常效果，相反，它会受到{@damage 4d6}的毒药伤害，并被{@condition poisoned}。当{@condition poisoned}以这种方式存在时，一个生物在它的每个回合结束时都会重复拯救动作。在随后的救赎失败时，它将受到（%4%）的毒药伤害，并且仍然是（%5%）。在随后的救赎成功时，它不再是{@condition poisoned}，并且在24小时内对{@italic castings of doom of serpent coils}免疫。",
	"Multiple castings of this spell have no additional effect on creatures that are already {@condition poisoned} by it. The effect can be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.": "多次施放此法术对已经被其影响的生物没有额外的效果，（%0%）。该效果可以通过防毒或类似的魔法结束。",
	"This spell is cast on a melee weapon. The next time that weapon is used, it destroys the target's nonmagical shield or damages nonmagical armor, in addition to the normal effect of the attack. If the foe is using a nonmagical shield, it breaks into pieces. If the foe doesn't use a shield, its nonmagical armor takes a -2 penalty to AC. If the target doesn't use armor or a shield, the spell is expended with no effect.": "这个咒语是对一个近战武器施放的。下次使用该武器时，除了攻击的正常效果外，还会破坏目标的非魔法盾牌或损坏非魔法盔甲。如果敌人使用的是非魔法盾牌，它会碎裂成碎片。如果敌人没有使用盾牌，它的非魔法盔甲对AC值有一个-2的惩罚。如果目标没有使用盔甲或盾牌，则该法术被消耗，没有任何效果。",
	"The ground within 30 feet of a point you designate turns into filthy and slippery muck. This spell affects sand, earth, mud, and ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the mud until the spell ends.

A creature that frees itself or that enters the area after the spell was cast is affected by the difficult terrain but doesn't become {@condition restrained}.": "在你指定的点的30英尺范围内的地面会变成污秽和滑溜的泥土。这个法术会影响沙子、土、泥和冰，但不会影响石头、木头或其他材料。在持续时间内，受影响区域的地面为困难地形。当你施法时，在该区域的生物必须成功地进行力量救赎，否则就会被泥土所困，直到法术结束。一个{@condition restrained}的生物可以通过使用一个行动来做一个成功的力量救赎动作来释放自己。释放自己的生物或在施法后进入该区域的生物会受到困难地形的影响，但不会变成（%2%）。",
	"Each round, a {@condition restrained} creature sinks deeper into the muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is {@condition restrained} for 3 rounds becomes submerged at the end of its third turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds. Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren't holding their breath. A creature that is still submerged when the spell ends is sealed beneath the newly solidified ground.

	"You create a ripple of dark energy that destroys everything it touches. A 10-foot-radius, 10-foot-deep, cylindrical extradimensional hole appears on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.": "你创造了一个黑暗能量的涟漪，摧毁了它所接触的一切。一个半径为10英尺、深为10英尺的圆柱形超维洞出现在一个足够大的水平面上。由于它延伸到了另一个维度，这个坑没有重量，也不会取代原来的底层材料。你可以在一艘船的甲板上创造这个坑，就像在地牢的地板或森林的地面上一样容易。",
	"The pit's radius expands by 10 feet at the start of your turn each round for the duration. Any creature standing in the original conjured space, or on a space taken up by the pit as it grows, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Any creature adjacent to the pit when it expands must likewise succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in. Creatures subjected to a successful pushing effect (such as by a spell like gust of wind) may not make this saving throw. Creatures that fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. ": "坑的半径在你每回合开始时扩大10英尺，持续期间。任何站在原来的魔法空间里的生物，或者站在坑扩大后所占据的空间里的生物，都必须成功地进行灵巧反射，以避免掉入坑中。当坑扩大时，任何与之相邻的生物都必须同样成功地进行灵巧救赎，以避免掉入坑中。受到成功的推挤效果的生物（例如由阵风之类的法术）可能不会做这个蓄力动作。掉进坑里的生物会受到正常的坠落伤害。",

	"This spell covers a 20-foot-by-20-foot section of wall or floor within range with a thin coating of grease. If a vertical surface is affected, each climber on that surface must make a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check or immediately fall from the surface unless it is held in place by ropes or other climbing gear. A creature standing on an affected floor falls {@condition prone} unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that try to climb or move through the affected area can move no faster than half speed (this is cumulative with the usual reduction for climbing), and any movement must be followed by a Strength saving throw (for climbing) or a Dexterity saving throw (for walking).

	"You grant a touched creature a limited gift of luck. While the spell lasts, the target can gain advantage on any three rolls of its choice. Once three rolls have been affected, the spell ends.": "你给予一个被触及的生物一个有限的幸运礼物。在咒语持续期间，目标可以在其选择的任何三个卷轴中获得优势。一旦有三次滚动受到影响，咒语就会结束。",
	"A willing creature you touch has advantage on the first three death saving throws it attempts before the duration of the spell expires.": "你所接触到的自愿的生物在法术持续时间结束前，在它所尝试的前三次死亡拯救中具有优势。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th, 6th, or 7th level, the maximum duration increases to 48 hours.

	"Your magic protects the target creature from the life-sapping energies of the undead. For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a {@creature shadow}'s Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a {@creature specter}'s Life Drain. This spell doesn't prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.": "你的魔法可以保护目标生物免受亡灵能量的侵蚀。在持续时间内，目标对来自亡灵生物的减少其能力分数的效果有免疫力，例如{@creature shadow}的力量消耗，或其最大命中率，例如{@creature specter}的生命耗尽。这个法术并不能阻止这些攻击的伤害，它只能阻止能力值或最大命中率的降低。",
	"You lay a glamer upon a touched creature that makes it easily overlooked and forgettable. For the duration of the spell, any Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the target, or any ability checks made to recall details about the target or any interactions with it, are made with disadvantage. The target gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, but has disadvantage on any Charisma checks made while under the glamer.": "你在被触及的生物身上涂上一层光晕，使其容易被忽视和遗忘。在咒语的持续时间内，任何注意目标的智慧（感知）检查，或任何回忆目标细节或与之互动的能力检查，都是以劣势进行的。目标在灵巧（隐身）检查中获得优势，但在被冰封的情况下，任何魅力检查都是劣势。",
	"Provided you're not carrying more of a load than your carrying capacity permits, you can walk on the surface of snow rather than wading through it, and you ignore its effect on movement. Ice supports your weight no matter how thin it is, and you can travel on ice as if you were wearing ice skates. You still leave tracks normally while under these effects.": "只要你的负荷没有超过你的承载能力所允许的范围，你就可以在雪的表面行走，而不是涉水而过，而且你忽略了它对运动的影响。无论冰有多薄，它都能支撑你的重量，你可以在冰上行走，就像你穿着冰鞋一样。在这些影响下，你仍然会正常地留下足迹。",

	"When you cast this spell, you erect a barrier of energy drawn from the realm of death and shadow. This barrier is a wall 20 feet high and 60 feet long, or a ring 20 feet high and 20 feet in diameter. The wall is transparent when viewed from one side of your choice and translucent—lightly obscuring the area beyond it—from the other. A creature that tries to move through the wall must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or stop in front of the wall and become {@condition frightened} until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can try again to move through. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against the wall, it is immune to the effect of this barrier.": "当你施展这个法术时，你会竖起一道从死亡和阴影领域汲取的能量屏障。这个屏障是一堵高20英尺、长60英尺的墙，或者一个高20英尺、直径20英尺的环。从你选择的一面看，这堵墙是透明的，而从另一面看，则是半透明的--轻度遮蔽了墙外的区域。试图穿过墙壁的生物必须做一个成功的智慧救赎，否则就会停在墙壁前面，并变得（%0%），直到该生物的下一个回合开始时，它可以再次尝试穿过。一旦一个生物对墙做了一个成功的蓄力动作，它就对这个屏障的效果免疫。",
	"You create a hidden glyph by tracing it on a surface or object that you touch. When you cast the spell, you can also choose a location that's known to you, within 5 miles, and on the same plane of existence, to serve as the destination for the glyph's shifting effect.": "你通过在你触摸的表面或物体上描画它来创造一个隐藏的字形。当你施法时，你也可以选择一个你所知道的、在5英里范围内、在同一存在平面上的地点，作为石刻转移效果的目的地。",
	"The glyph is triggered when it's touched by a creature that's not aware of its presence.

	"A creature you touch traverses craggy slopes with the surefootedness of a mountain goat. When ascending a slope that would normally be difficult terrain for it, the target can move at its full speed instead. The target also gains a +2 bonus on Dexterity checks and saving throws to prevent falling, to catch a ledge or otherwise stop a fall, or to move along a narrow ledge.": "你所接触的生物能以山羊般稳健的脚步穿越陡峭的斜坡。当登上一个对它来说通常是困难地形的斜坡时，目标可以用它的全速移动。目标还能在灵巧检查和蓄力动作上获得+2的奖励，以防止跌倒，抓住壁架或以其他方式阻止跌倒，或者沿着狭窄的壁架移动。",

	"You make natural terrain in a 1-mile cube difficult to traverse. A creature in the affected area has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks or travel safely through the area, as paths through the terrain seem to twist and turn nonsensically. The terrain itself isn't changed, only the perception of those inside it. A creature that succeeds on two Wisdom (Survival) checks while in the terrain discerns the illusion for what it is and sees the illusory twists and turns superimposed on the terrain. A creature that reenters the area after exiting it before the spell ends is affected by the spell even if it previously succeeded in traversing the terrain. A creature with truesight can see through the illusion and is unaffected by the spell. A creature that casts {@spell find the path} automatically succeeds in discovering a way out of the terrain.": "你使1英里范围内的自然地形变得难以穿越。受影响区域内的生物在智慧（生存）检查中处于劣势，无法追踪足迹或安全通过该区域，因为通过该地形的路径似乎是扭曲的、无意义的。地形本身并没有改变，只是里面的人的感知发生了变化。在地形中的生物，如果两次智慧（生存）检查成功，就能分辨出这是什么幻觉，并看到叠加在地形上的虚幻的扭曲和转弯。在咒语结束前退出该区域后重新进入该区域的生物会受到该咒语的影响，即使它之前成功穿越了该地形。拥有真实视力的生物可以看穿幻象，并且不受法术的影响。施放{@spell find the path}的生物会自动成功发现离开地形的方法。",
	"When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the word as it enters the area automatically sees the illusion and is unaffected by the spell. ": "当你施展这个法术时，你可以指定一个密码。在进入该区域时说出这个词的生物会自动看到这个幻象，并且不受法术的影响。",
	"If you cast this spell on the same spot every day for one year, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.": "如果你在一年内每天在同一地点施展这个咒语，这个幻觉会持续到它被驱散。",
	"You create an intoxicating aroma that fills the area within 30 feet of a point you can see within range. Creatures in this area smell something they find so pleasing that it's distracting. Each creature in the area that makes an attack roll must first make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the attack is made with disadvantage. Only a creature's first attack in a round is affected this way; subsequent attacks are resolved normally. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to the effect of this particular scent, but they can be affected again by a new casting of the spell.": "你创造一种令人陶醉的香气，充斥在你能看到的范围内30英尺的区域。这个区域内的生物会闻到它们觉得很愉悦的气味，以至于让它们分心。该区域内的每个生物在进行攻击时必须先进行智慧救赎，如果救赎失败，则攻击将以劣势进行。只有生物在一个回合中的第一次攻击会受到这种影响；随后的攻击会正常解决。拯救成功后，生物会对这种特殊气味的影响产生免疫，但他们可以通过新的法术施放再次受到影响。",

	"This spell functions only against an arcane or divine spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If you make a successful melee attack against such a creature before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that attack, the target takes {@damage 2d4} necrotic damage and one or more of the victim's available spell slots are transferred to you, to be used as your own. Roll a {@dice d6}; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest possible level are transferred before lower-level slots.

	"If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then this spell has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage.

	"You take on the physical characteristics of the terrain around you. In a forest, grass and tiny mushrooms sprout in your hair, moss beards your chin, and your flesh takes on the mottled hue of leaf green and bark brown. In an arctic grassland, gray lichens and the various shades of boreal grasses cloak your presence. This effect provides a +2 bonus to Stealth checks in the appropriate terrain.": "你会呈现出你周围地形的物理特征。在森林里，草和小蘑菇在你的头发上发芽，苔藓在你的下巴上长出胡子，你的肉体呈现出叶绿和树皮棕色的斑驳色调。在北极草原上，灰色地衣和各种色调的北极草掩盖了你的存在。在相应的地形中，该效果为隐身检查提供+2的奖励。",

	"You infuse the metal of a melee weapon you touch with the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon's wielder has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition, an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and is struck by the weapon must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be {@condition stunned} for 1 round. If the creature has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon's wielder currently has, it becomes {@condition frightened} instead; a {@condition frightened} creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to castings of this spell on the same weapon for 24 hours.": "你为你接触的近战武器的金属注入强大的英雄的可怕光环。武器持有者在积极挥舞武器时，对魅力（恐吓）的检查具有优势。此外，目前拥有30点或更少命中率的对手，如果被武器击中，必须成功地进行魅力救赎，否则会在1个回合内受到（%0%）的伤害。如果该生物拥有超过30点的命中率，但少于武器持有者目前拥有的命中率，它就会变成{@condition frightened}；{@condition frightened}的生物在其每个回合结束时重复蓄力，在蓄力成功时结束对其的影响。蓄力成功的生物在24小时内对同一武器上的此法术的施放免疫。",

Creatures slain in the affected area cannot be raised as undead by magic or by the abilities of monsters, even if the corpse is later removed from the area.

Such spells cast with spell slots of 5th level or higher function normally.": "你召唤神力来祝福你周围60英尺内的地面。在受影响区域被杀的生物不能被魔法或怪物的能力复活为亡灵，即使后来尸体被移出该区域。任何四级或更低级的法术，如果能在该区域内召唤或激活亡灵，都会自动失败。用5级或更高等级的法术槽施展的此类法术则正常运作。",

Failing to complete the task does not incur any penalties as long as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise, leads you to forsake your vow (being {@condition charmed}, for instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if you do not break the vow).": "如果你自愿放弃你的誓言，咒语就会结束，你会受到（%0%）的精神伤害。根据GM的判断，你可能会受到其他惩罚，需要为你的决定赎罪。详情见圣骑士等级描述中的 \"违背你的誓言 \"侧栏。只要你忠实于你的誓言，未能完成任务就不会产生任何惩罚，如果某种形式的外部胁迫，不管是魔法的还是其他的，导致你放弃你的誓言（例如被{@condition charmed}，或者如果你不违背誓言，一个恶棍威胁到无辜者的生命），你也会受到惩罚。",

	"You make a camouflaged shelter nestled in the branches of a tree or among a collection of stones. The shelter is a 10-foot cube centered on a point within range. It can hold as many as nine Medium or smaller creatures. The atmosphere inside the shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

	"You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the words works on the mind of a creature that reads it, convincing the creature that there is some importance to the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance. ": "你在羊皮纸、纸张或其他合适的书写材料上写字，并给它注入强大的魔力，持续一段时间。实际上写的是什么并不重要；写在字上的魔法对阅读它的生物的思想起作用，使其相信这条信息有一定的重要性，必须加以发现。读取信息的生物必须在智慧救赎中获得成功，否则就会被强迫继续阅读和重读这些文字，试图找出其意义和重要性。",
	"During combat, a creature so enthralled it can take no actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic missive can make a new saving throw against the effects at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation.  In nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new saving throw against the effects every hour.": "在战斗中，被迷住的生物在其回合中不能采取任何行动或反应，但如果它选择或需要这样做（例如将自己从危险中移开），则可以移动。如果处于战斗状态，受催眠信物影响的生物可以在其回合开始时对其效果进行新的蓄力。 在没有威胁的情况下，该生物可以每小时对该效果进行一次新的蓄力。",

This does not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the creature reads the words again, it must make another save or fall under the spell's effects once more.": "一旦生物成功地进行了救赎，它就会认识到影响它的魔法蛊惑。然而这并不能提供对咒语的免疫力，如果该生物再次读到这些话，它必须再次进行救赎，否则就会再次受到咒语的影响。",
