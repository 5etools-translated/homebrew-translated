	"The Axiomatic General is the god of those who use the self-evident and unquestionable power of law to further a cause. Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved.": "公理将军是那些利用不言而喻和不容置疑的法律力量来推进事业的人的神。最常见的是在战争期间，无论是无益的善恶道德，还是混乱的无序，都无法做出明确的决定，也无法取得胜利。",
	"The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached. The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.": "公理将军出现在任何正在准备或遵循的清晰思考、深思熟虑的战术和平衡的计划中。虽然战争领域是这些活动的通常场所，但公理将军也被称为出现在复杂但没有感情的法庭案件中，有时甚至在达到真正的僧侣式开悟的冷酷、超然的清晰度时出现。公理将军既不是男性也不是女性，而是一种没有身体上的分心偏见的生物。它可以作为任何类人物种的女性或男性出现，无论哪种形式最可能有助于决策的清晰性。",
	"The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil, and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects it believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered \"wars\" rather than short-and-sharp fights—the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one's options, testing one's theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts. The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.": "公理将军及其追随者希望将法律的清晰性带给那些目前生活在情绪混乱中的地方，并向所有人展示法律在应用于战争、法律框架和个人行为时的公理性质。它期望它的信徒们能够煽动和遵守有意义的法律，同时揭露和修正那些可笑的、离奇的、迂回的、无法执行的或相反的法律。战争监督者厌恶任何允许个人不公平地利用他人的决定或过程，无论是通过情感勒索、滥用个人权力等方法，还是作为机会的结果。它鼓励其追随者参与长期有序的 \"战争\"，而不是短兵相接的战斗--战斗的混乱是众所周知的，但通过仔细考虑自己的选择，测试自己的理论，然后贯彻一个精心策划的计划，就能以一种有序的方式取得胜利。如果周围的人都清楚他们的意图，人们可以看到他们的行动是尽可能的公平和公正，即使在最大的冲突中，贸易和公共繁荣、法院和整个社会的发展也能继续下去。万战之主提倡在所有事情上都要仔细考虑，并期望其追随者能够为他们的所有行动提供不言而喻的真理。匆忙、猜测和自我陶醉会导致对情感的依赖和卑劣、不受控制的行动。它不赞成依赖政府或任何助长盲目信任的宗教机构，甚至更糟糕的是，无法证明的信仰，它解释说，那些具有健全的判断力、精神纪律和对合理的、不可辩驳的法律的不可动摇的掌握的人，可以克服情感和混乱的群众的不真实的证据和无效的论点。",
	"Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War's final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself. The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race's pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity's followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute—a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.": "公理将军曾经是一个凡人，后来升为神灵，虽然不清楚它曾经到底是什么，因为几乎所有的种族都有一个传奇的历史人物，在遵循一个伟大的战士的道路，不知疲倦地支持其神灵之后，从凡人的行列升为神灵。显而易见的是，战争监督者变得比这个最初的神灵更强大，并在长期冲突的顶点最终审判了它。全战之主的最终裁决和胜利为战士本身上升为神明提供了所需的能量和证据。公理将军倾向于在历史上出现（作为其人形类型的简单战士），当该种族卓越的合法神灵首次对一个以上的非合法敌人发动战争时，无论他们是善、恶还是混乱。它有很多头衔（上面有几个），但总是有能力做出清晰、简明和完全准确的决定，即使是在激烈的战斗和迷雾中。传说中，战争监督者总是要维护另一个神的信徒的合法目标和野心，而这个神或女神本身被证明是软弱和易变的。然后，公理将军在评判有关神灵并发现其不合格之前，介入拯救那些同样的崇拜者。在这之后，它向敌人发起了战斗，以不容置疑的判断力扭转了战争的局势，并成为了自己的神祗。在这之后，所有战争之主总是被发现带领那些知道它的话是真理的人通过冲突、分歧和争议--这是一条通往绝对的、不可否认的胜利的可靠途径。",
	"The Overseer of Warl is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centered emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.": "Warl的监督者完全不屑于任何和所有其他在某种程度上不接受合法信仰的神祗。当那些鼓吹混乱的人感受到它的愤怒时，公理将军不断寻求推翻中立的善神和中立的恶神的信条，因为他们依赖于感性或以自我为中心的情感。它容忍合法的善神和合法的恶神，只要他们的合法性质处于行动的最前沿，并且在与邪恶的魔鬼的冲突中支持一个有合法思想的大主教，就像支持一个有合法思想的魔鬼与一个过度善良的大主教开战一样；最终，法律的平衡是最重要的。",
	"The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and \"belief\"—it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.": "公理将军遭到所有提倡个人选择、不受控制的行动和 \"信仰 \"的人的反对--它保证会与那些支持和培养吟游诗人和野蛮人的神灵发生冲突，并经常与那些培养野生巫师的神灵发生冲突。由于它与结论性的绝对真理密切相关，万战之主有时会发现自己站在圣人、专家、哲学家和学者一边，这些人致力于揭示失落的或隐藏的真理，无论是军事、法律、商业还是魔法。",
	"The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god's symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a {@i +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace}, the look and effect of which is in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:": "公理将军通常以一个健康、充满活力的相应种族成员的形象出现，可以是女性或男性（或两者都不是）。它的服装总是符合实际情况，但显然是为了给人以信心，而且始终是明亮的白色。神的象征，装饰的铁棒，被缝在心脏上方的空间里，并由其挥舞的武器模仿。战争监督者总是带着（%0%），其外观和效果与附近的高级教士的主要领域一致，如下。",
	"Alertness": "警觉性",
	"Nobility": "崇高的地位",
	"Splendor": "辉煌",
	"Strength": "强度",
	"Flailing": "摇摆不定",
	"Rulership": "统治权",
	"Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.": "传说中，公理将军偶尔会以完全高级的、涂有金刚砂的马鲁特的形象出现，但最后一次记录是在许多代以前。",
	"Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn't appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.": "万能的主的追随者和神职人员知道，计划的清晰性、对前进道路的更深理解，或经过仔细思考和考虑后获得的对问题的洞察力，都来自他们的神灵。这种知识不会突然出现，而是对花时间和探索所有可能性的回报。战争监督者高度评价那些在果断行动前考虑其选择的人，以及那些毫不动摇地贯彻长期计划的人。",
	"Any sign of plans failing, confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.": "任何计划失败的迹象，混乱的统治，或参与者不理解他们的角色，都被视为公理将军不高兴的迹象，并期望有更多的纪律和预先考虑。",
	"The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.": "公理将军奖励那些善于组织并遵守商定计划的人，无论这可能需要多长时间。如果是地精和人类等寿命较短的人种，这些阴谋诡计往往需要好几代人的时间，或者是寿命最长的精灵的整个生命。仆人们必须准备好为更长远的利益牺牲眼前的利益，理解他们今天可能会为了明天合法人口的改善而失去身边的人，并认识到合法的未来的需要超过此时此地的任何考虑。",
	"The Overseer of War grants particular favor to those who constantly uphold the law—inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.": "战争监督者对那些不断维护法律的人给予了特别的恩惠--不可避免的人被看作是受人尊敬的，与形式主义者和其他有集体意识的生物一样。那些终生致力于实现长期合法目标的追随者会定期从他们的神那里获得洞察力和清晰度。那些花了大量时间对某条道路有更深入的了解，或者能够迅速判断多种可能性的特点和好处，然后迅速做出正确决定的人，往往会获得一两个神圣的提示。",
	"Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decisions are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer's table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer's or sage's rooms, to the chambers of a country's most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the Klavek Kingdom's most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.": "崇拜万物之主的场所只有一个目的：确保做出正确的决定，以推进无可争议的真理。它们的大小不一，从军官帐篷里的桌子，教士解释真理的简单沙盘，或律师或圣人的房间，到一个国家最宏伟的法庭的房间，战争中最新战役前线的秩序旗帜，或Klavek王国最壮观的大教堂内最宏伟的图书馆，都是对公理将军的崇拜。献给这位神的教堂都是简单朴素的事务，在消除精神干扰和杂乱的同时，让战争监督者所说的公理和信条得到有效和高效的传播。",
	"Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs—there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War's tenets are involved—although there is no sense of \"victory or defeat\" in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.": "对公理将军的崇拜经常是沉默的，因为追随者会考虑手头的实际问题，以及需要更深层次解决的长期问题。追随者们经常进行辩论，其中大多数是严肃但令人愉快的事情--当涉及到所有战争之主的信条时，没有时间进行轻率的思考--尽管在这些会议中没有 \"胜利或失败 \"的感觉（目的是达成对问题最真实、最准确的解决方案，而且每个人都能学到一些东西）。必要时，战争监督者的教堂在善与恶的交战派别之间提供了一个中立的会面点，尽管只有最有经验和资历的神职人员才试图在混乱的元素之间进行调解。公理将军表明，对于法律的追随者来说，最明智的做法是在利用沉思和辩论解决哲学和个人的合法分歧之前，通过任何可能的手段共同克服混乱。",
	"The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centers that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god's aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, of unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren't considered failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don't repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.": "战争监督者的神职人员以清晰明显的等级制度来组织自己，就像任何现代军队、企业或法庭一样。同样，追随公理之神的宗教和教育中心也有一个朴素的结构，表明谁最能证明对神的目的和目标的理解。无论在哪里或如何追随万能的主，它的教会都是由他们对明确的真理，对无可指责的法律，不可战胜的战术，以及无可置疑的启蒙的掌握来定义的。那些表现出知识胜于信仰，并能为这些真理提供不可否认的证据的教会，无论其规模如何，都具有最重要的地位。崇拜者也以同样的方式提升等级：任何能够建立无可辩驳的知识和信息的人都被赋予越来越大的责任。同时，如果相关人员能证明他们尽了最大努力来建立清晰和深思熟虑的答案，那么错误就不会被视为失败。他们所要做的就是认识到进一步的调查已经产生了更好的知识，并确保他们不会再犯错误。由于万物之主乐于制定多代人的计划，可以纠正的错误没有什么后果。",
	"Churches worshiping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the center of lawful societies and towards the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos, but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them—a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.": "崇拜公理将军的教堂公开出现在合法社会的中心和那些对法律或混乱没有偏好的人群的郊区，但在混乱的文化中似乎没有。战争监督者倾向于让他的追随者包围这些文化，并逐渐向内移动，直到混乱被击垮--这个过程需要多长时间就有多长时间，目的是确保没有崇拜者被欺骗而从内部加入混乱。",
	"Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.": "对公理将军的服务是有条不紊的，包括对真理的思考或对研究结果的尊重陈述以及随后的决策影响。在所有情况下，每个人都有充分的机会发言，尽管追随者认识到在战争情况下需要迅速采取行动，并发展出一种简短、精确的风格来介绍他们的发现。",
	"The Axiomatic General is primarily worshiped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.": "公理将军主要受到军官的崇拜，但也吸引了法官、律师、大律师、圣人、僧侣和那些以有序和结构化方式推进社会的人。那些沉溺于混乱的思想和行为的人在任何时候都会被忽视。",
	"The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren't they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.": "战争监督者的神职人员不一定是神职人员，尽管如果他们不是神职人员，他们只能在自己的专业领域和影响范围内代表神（例如，军官只能领导有关军事事务的礼拜和讨论）。任何身为神职人员的成员都必须以总体身份领导仪式，即使内容是由高级主题专家决定的。在所有情况下，最有经验的神职人员都要领导礼拜，并酌情由会众中的其他成员协助。",
	"The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn't always going to be the best it can be in some situations.": "公理将军不支持圣骑士，尽管他们的武德观。他们向善的倾向导致他们并不总是考虑合法生活的平衡需求，这反过来又意味着他们的判断力在某些情况下并不总是能达到最好。",
	"Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god's tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn't unusual for there to be four temples next to each other—one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.": "献给万战之主的建筑是功能性的，没有任何装饰，旨在为神的信条的所有方面服务，但显然专注于一个领域而不是其他领域（不管那是什么）。旁边有四座寺庙--每一个方面的奉献，信徒们都会去拜访最适合他们需要的寺庙，这种情况并不罕见。",
	"All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the center of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.": "所有的礼拜场所都有一个共同的物品：一个神奇的带锁的铅盒，里面放着《公理通》的四本圣典（《确定真理的四个平面》），外加一本关于会众专业领域的具体思想。这些盒子是相同的，因为装饰或阐述是被禁止的，是不必要的分心，并且总是处于任何崇拜服务或决策过程的中心。每当盒子在一天的最后使用后被锁上，如果发现了任何信息的更准确和真实的版本，以及发现了新的事实，每本书内的文字都会通过神的干预被更新。",
	"Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.": "每个礼拜场所还包含了任何致力于揭示无可争议的真理的人的思想过程，以及证明该真理的证据。每当有人发现新的真理时，他们正在进行的工作材料也存放在这里。",
	"The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn't used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn't required).": "确定真理的四个平面包含了公理将军所确认的相关和明确的声明。当储存在他们的魔法盒子里时，当它在一天结束时被锁上时，它们会通过神的干预而被更新。没有这个盒子在，就不会有任何决定，即使它没有被使用。战争监督者的神职人员在冥想中会收到变化的通知；我们鼓励所有神职人员和服务领导用心学习这些文本（因为不需要翻译）。",
	"Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols scored through.": "每本书都有一个简单的封面和装订，除了在一个标识其内容的风格化字母上有一根铁棒外，几乎没有其他装饰。储存在寺庙和神社的其他文件也有这两个符号，加上作者的姓名缩写和出版日期。当任何文件被取代时，其被废止的日期会被印在封面上，而原来的符号则被划破。",

Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as short cuts) lead to incorrect decision with long-term consequences.": "{@b Axioms of Decisions}: 这本书包含了有效和高效的冥想的最新方法和方向，以及教会最伟大的圣人和专家的长期研究技术。如果在调查开始前查阅，它能赋予头脑清醒和注意力集中的效果，因为它证实了它的行动如何让使用者揭示出最相关和最准确的信息。各章详细介绍了如何考虑需要发现什么，如何确保所发现的东西符合最初的要求，然后如何使用这些信息来做出正确的决定。他们还描述了分散注意力、混淆视听、扭曲目标和对象（如捷径）是如何导致具有长期后果的不正确决策的。",
	"{@b Axioms of Enlightenment}: This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.": "{@b Axioms of Enlightenment}: 它包含了理解整个世界和人在这个世界上所扮演的角色的途径，以及如何通过秩序实现最好的生活。如果在冥想前查阅，它将赋予一种开放的心态，确保正确遵循开悟的路线，因为它证实了它的行动如何让使用者在没有偏差或分心的情况下达到自知之明。各章详细介绍了冥想前、冥想中和冥想后该做什么，以及如何实现已达到的开悟。他们还描述了我们的沉思如何被他人的行为所削弱，但这些离题如何被克服并最终达到开悟。",
	"The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead when the law prevails during any of the god's areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task in hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one's body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.": "公理之神没有在任何特定的节日进行庆祝。相反，当法律在神所关注的任何领域中占上风时，追随者会在事件发生后不超过30分钟内进行感恩祈祷。如果超过这个时间才表示感谢，那可能意味着追随者从手头的工作中分心了，并以混乱的方式行事，使感谢符合要求。与其把自己从紧迫的事情中抽身出来，使两种情况变得混乱，不如用自己的身体和思想来承认战争监督者的效果。",
	"Balir is considered to be first among dwarves, yet least among gods - a mortal hero granted divinity through his great actions and heroic sacrifices.": "巴利尔被认为是矮人中的第一人，但又是众神中的最小人--一个凡人英雄通过他的伟大行动和英勇牺牲而被授予神性。",
	"Balir's mortal life began as a dweorg, a remnant of the once great race from which all dwarves stemmed. He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the drow, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld; and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armor. Inside this shell he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.": "巴里尔的凡人生活开始于一个德威格人，一个曾经伟大的种族的残余，所有的矮人都来自于此。他很不满意；矮人已经成为一个较低的种族，被乌鸦等人所征服。他的生活中充满了不断的斗争和传说中的英雄壮举：他重新掌握了他的祖先曾经知道的失落的金属加工艺术；他单枪匹马地保卫了他的祖国，对抗冥界的生物；他为自己打造了一套完美无瑕的牢不可破的盔甲。在这个外壳里，他是一股不可阻挡的力量，巴里尔夺回了数千英里的曾经的矮人土地。在犯下向乌鸦伸出和平之手的致命缺陷之前，他比任何人都要高。",
	"The story goes that the drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armor, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But in this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armor that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.": "故事说，鸦人在他牢不可破的盔甲中施放了一个燃烧的诅咒，把矮人封在里面，并永远地把它烧毁了。但在这一时刻，众神将巴里尔视为他的人民中最伟大的烈士，并赋予他神性的火花；他作为一个神醒来，仍然在已经成为他坟墓的盔甲中，并离开了凡间。",
	"Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man's comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger - a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.": "巴利尔从凡人的行列中崛起，被迫一次又一次地向众神证明自己，向他们展示自己的价值。他作为神的功绩并不亚于他作为凡人的功绩，尽管它们发生在人类无法理解的领域。正是在这些神圣的劳作中，他获得了他强大的锤子--灵魂锻造者--这种武器显然是从比巴里尔本人大很多倍的生物那里获得的。",
	"Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir's scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. Cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armor destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.": "即使在他发现自己成为神的时候，巴利尔仍然保留了他被毁坏的凡人形态，作为他忏悔的一个标志。他没有使用神的肉体，而是为自己建造了一个金属身体，以取代他失去的那个。这个新的皮肤没有摧毁他作为一个凡人的怜悯的缺陷。虽然巴里尔那张伤痕累累的脸是明确无误的矮人，但他的身体却不是这样。他的身体由白色密特拉尔和黑铁铸成，看起来更像是机器而不是人。现在，即使他那被乌鸦诅咒的盔甲被毁，他仍然燃烧着凶猛的火焰；在他的胸口，他带着太阳诞生的火花。当他不以神的形式出现时，巴里尔会化身为一个年轻的侏儒，脸上和手臂上通常有火焰留下的伤痕。",
	"Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, of toil, and of creation. In them, they are guided by Balir's ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir's clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim to his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson - styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it's always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter, or a promising apprentice.": "巴利尔的教堂既简陋又宏伟。他们的礼拜场所简单而不加修饰，但总是很实用，与矮人的生活本身相称。无论是最小的神殿还是最宏伟的大教堂，供奉巴利尔的场所总是站在工作、劳作和创造的地方附近。在这些地方，他们在巴里尔的古老知识和秘密的指导下，生产出与世界上其他地方不同的机器、机械产品和活跃的艺术作品。巴里尔的神职人员主要是矮人，但也有一些人类对他的信仰表示赞同。在条件允许的情况下，他们会穿上密特拉尔和深红色的衣服--以他们的神为造型。贫穷的信仰成员则穿着白色和黄色的衣服。崇拜者们几乎总是将建造的物品作为他们的祭品。如果他们真的诉诸于金钱，那也总是针对一个新的合格的工匠，或者一个有前途的学徒。",
	"The {@i Life of Balir} is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir's life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinion, not fact. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir's own son, after the dwarf's ascension to godhood.": "{@i Life of Balir}与任何标准的圣训书不同。相反，这本巨著长达近三千页，详细记录了巴利尔一生中的千百次考验和磨难，其写作方式更像是一本矮人的自助书，而不是神圣的指示。有些版本还有附加卷，讨论巴里尔采取的每项行动的优点，尽管这些都是已知的观点，而不是事实。原文与巴里尔的儿子在矮人升为神之后撰写的《巴里尔》相比没有任何变化。",
	"Extremely little is known about the Current, save that it is the only god of the vestraadi. The blind men of the Underworld once had an entire pantheon that matched the grandeur of their ocean-bed civilizations, but the Current appeared from the depths of the cosmos as suddenly as a gigantic aquatic predator and consumed them all.": "人们对海流的了解极少，只知道它是维斯塔拉迪的唯一神。冥界的盲人曾经有一个完整的万神殿，与他们的海床文明的宏伟相匹配，但海流从宇宙深处突然出现，就像一个巨大的水生捕食者，把他们全部吃掉了。",
	"The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Current's tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods don't seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadi's ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.": "阿文泰尔的其他神灵永远警惕着电流的触角在他们的计划中或靠近他们的本质，与这个令人疯狂的神灵保持着尊敬的距离。它的动机是完全不可预测的，尽管它在适合的时候会迅速地、毫无征兆地进行打击。然而，诸神的事务似乎对电流并不感兴趣，人们认为它在沉睡，就像那些躺在维斯塔拉迪古文明废墟中的巨大野兽。事实上，有些人认为这些巨大的掠食者在某种程度上与令人抓狂的神有关，而且不是没有理由的；它们在 \"电流 \"来到阿文泰尔不久就出现了。",
	"Records of The Current's appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is a floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colors for which there is no shade or name.": "关于 \"海流 \"外观的记录必然是极其模糊的；那些看到它的人被彻底逼疯了。少数可靠的说法是，它是一团漂浮的、滑动的或脉动的蠕动的触手，每条触手的末端都覆盖着颜色的倒刺，没有任何颜色或名称。",
	"These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopuses—the architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.": "这些受人尊敬的礼拜堂完全包含了里面的人，覆盖在整个结构中的触角雕塑。最神圣的教堂实际上是由巨大的鱿鱼和章鱼的肢体复原而成的--其中的建筑使任何非电流的追随者陷入疯狂，如果他们不能通过DC16智慧救赎，就会使其中的任何生物受到某种形式的精神错乱的折磨。",
	"No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep {@i song strings}. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current's religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these {@i song strings} are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity, but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.": "不存在任何关于疯狂之神的宗教书籍；相反，维斯塔拉迪保持（%0%）。当在水下缠绕或松开时，这些神奇的绳索就会播放水流宗教的赞美诗（用听到的人能够理解的语言）。其中最神圣和最有价值的{@i song strings}据说是关于水神的真正起源，但据说会让听到它们的人被海流的声音逼疯，被诅咒永远活在他们脑海中的回声中。",
	"Eureum is commonly portrayed as an unfeeling god, who cares little for the world so long as nothing interrupts the cycle of life to death. However, this view of him is false, for more important to him is the return again to life, and the continuance of the cycle of life.": "Eureum通常被描绘成一个无情的神，只要没有任何东西打断从生到死的循环，他就不关心这个世界。然而，对他的这种看法是错误的，因为对他来说，更重要的是再次回到生命中，以及生命循环的延续。",
	"Often, this message is confused by his followers and those who encounter them, fanatics who see in him little more than another aspect of death. Only a few of his followers are true believers, often those who live within nature and see the true nature of the cycle of life and death.": "通常，这一信息被他的追随者和遇到他们的人所混淆，这些狂热者在他身上看到的不过是死亡的另一个方面。他的追随者中只有少数人是真正的信徒，往往是那些生活在自然界中的人，他们看到了生命和死亡循环的真正本质。",
	"Eureum, along with the other three seasons, came into being as the world began to turn. The others chose their domains carefully, but Eureum took his from necessity. For, there must be balance in life as there must be balance in death. He feels it is job to keep the other seasons in check, and it was he who proposed dividing the world into the four seasons we know it as today.": "Eureum和其他三个季节一起，随着世界开始转动而出现。其他人谨慎地选择了他们的领域，但Eureum则是出于需要。因为，生命中必须有平衡，正如死亡中必须有平衡一样。他觉得让其他季节保持平衡是他的工作，正是他提议将世界分为我们今天所知的四个季节。",
	"Eureum often appears as a faceless figure, male or female, draped in a robe made of dried leaves and carrying a scythe in one skeletal hand, and a shovel in the other. It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.": "尤里姆经常以一个无脸的形象出现，无论男女，都披着一件干树叶做成的长袍，一只手拿着镰刀，另一只手拿着铲子。据说，在罩子下面，他永远在哭泣。",
	"When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.": "当他不以人形出现时，他就会出现在风中吹动的干燥秋叶的集合。",
	"Much to his dismay, most of Eureum's churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect - either death, or rebirth - and are often fanatical in their beliefs. He considers only a few shrines to him, often deep within forests and away from civilization, to be true churches.": "令他失望的是，大多数Eureum的教会都被误导了，只关注一个方面--要么是死亡，要么是重生--而且他们的信仰往往很狂热。他认为只有少数对他的神龛，往往是在森林深处，远离文明的地方，才是真正的教会。",
	"Eureum's followers are more often fanatics than they are proper clergy, focusing either on bringing either death or life wherever they go instead of maintaining the cycle of life and death.": "尤里姆的追随者往往是狂热者，而不是适当的神职人员，他们要么专注于在所到之处带来死亡，要么专注于带来生命，而不是维持生与死的循环。",
	"His true followers dress in dirty brown robes, often matted with dried leaves and crawling with tiny insects.": "他真正的追随者穿着肮脏的棕色长袍，常常被干枯的树叶遮盖，爬满了小昆虫。",
	"{@i On Death:} This book details the cycle of death, and life, and how all life depends on the death for sustenance as much as death depends on life - for one is impossible without the other. It also decries undead as abominations - for their death does not breed more life - only more death.": "{@i On Death:} 这本书详细介绍了死亡和生命的循环，以及所有生命是如何依靠死亡来维持的，就像死亡依靠生命一样--因为一个人没有另一个人就不可能。它还谴责亡灵是可憎的--因为它们的死亡并没有孕育出更多的生命--只有更多的死亡。",
	"Flaesuros (FLAY sur oss) is blindingly beautiful, with very pale skin, shoulder length, curly light brown hair, and eyes the color of jade. He is short and broad-shouldered and generally has a blissful expression. He usually wears scant clothing, dyed red-orange.": "弗莱苏鲁斯（FLAY sur oss）美得让人眼花缭乱，皮肤非常苍白，长及肩膀的浅棕色卷发，眼睛是玉石的颜色。他身材矮小，肩膀宽阔，通常有一个幸福的表情。他通常穿的衣服不多，染成橘红色。",
	"Unlike other deities of the sun, Flaesuros is an easy-going kind of god. He places more emphasis on doing good for others and the community, as opposed to oppressing people with laws. He does, however, understand and teach that laws are important and that all good people should follow them, until such time as they interfere with the good of the land.": "与其他太阳神不同，Flaesuros是一种随和的神。他更强调为他人和社区做好事，而不是用法律压迫人。然而，他确实理解并教导人们，法律是重要的，所有好人都应该遵守法律，直到它们干扰了土地的利益。",
	"He is often worshipped by women, as he is the God of Life. His large numbers of followers can be primarily distinguished by an ashes star worn on the back of the right hand. There are widespread temples to him on islands. There are many myths involving his daring adventures with certain mortals. He is the father of Nearru.": "他经常受到妇女的崇拜，因为他是生命之神。他的大量追随者主要可以通过佩戴在右手背上的灰烬之星来区分。岛屿上广泛存在着他的神庙。有许多神话故事涉及他与某些凡人的大胆冒险。他是纳鲁的父亲。",
	"Hado is a stoic sentinel among the gods, watching over the land with his intense gaze. His intensity matches the sun, with which he is often associated despite being a guardian of families, communities, and social order.": "哈多是众神中一个坚毅的哨兵，用他强烈的目光注视着这片土地。他的强度与太阳相匹配，尽管他是家庭、社区和社会秩序的守护者，但经常与太阳联系在一起。",
	"Hado is known in many parts of the world, though rarely worshipped due to his extremely strict set of rules he forces his followers to endure.": "哈多在世界的许多地方都很有名，但由于他强迫他的追随者忍受一套极其严格的规则，所以很少有人崇拜他。",
	"Hado is the oldest of the four winds, who came into being as the world began to turn. His three siblings knew the similarities between him and the scorching sun of midsummer and granted him the least yielding of seasons as his domain.": "哈多是四风中最年长的，当世界开始转动时，他就出现了。他的三个兄弟姐妹知道他和仲夏的烈日之间的相似之处，并将最不屈服的季节作为他的领域。",
	"Hado appears most often as a storm giant with a golden shield, whose eyes blaze with the intensity of the sun. However, he often also appears as dried grass blowing in the wind.": "哈多最经常出现的是一个带着金色盾牌的风暴巨人，他的眼睛闪耀着太阳的光芒。然而，他也经常以风中吹动的干草的形式出现。",
	"The church of Hado is a judicial system who watches and judges the communities they are part of. Often, they number amongst the lawyers and judges of the city's standard legal system as well, granting it divine legitimacy with the grace of their god.": "哈多教会是一个司法系统，他们监视和审判他们所处的社区。通常，他们也是城市标准法律系统的律师和法官，在他们的神的恩典下，授予它神圣的合法性。",
	"Hado's followers are typically men, often those who already have authority and power through their families or community position. They are also often involved in the legal systems of their communities, from clerks to judges. They wear green clothing with golden accents.": "哈多的追随者通常是男性，通常是那些通过其家庭或社区地位已经拥有权威和权力的人。他们也经常参与其社区的法律系统，从书记员到法官。他们穿绿色的衣服，有金色的装饰。",

It is often found even in other churches, for many of its tenants explain the laws of gods who are vaguer in their decrees.": "{@i Overwatch:}这本厚厚的书对人们要遵守的规则和人们被神明评判的方面进行了极其详细的阐述。它甚至在其他教会中也经常被发现，因为它的许多住户解释了那些在法令上比较模糊的神的法律。",
	"Hivaka was the last daughter of five children born to a minor drow house, House Ruim, in the city of Xdot. Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron's personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother's magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.": "希瓦卡是五个孩子中的最后一个女儿，出生在Xdot城的一个小乌鸦家族--鲁伊姆家族。她的母亲莱尔斯特拉是女院长的私人女秘书。希瓦卡只拥有她母亲最轻微的魔法能力，在很小的时候就掌握了咒语，但没有进一步发展。作为最小的女儿，几乎不比她唯一的哥哥大，而她的姐妹们已经被培养成家族中各种职位的继承人，希瓦卡发现自己被当作筹码，但她周围的人几乎都在利用。",
	"Hivaka's father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd's vices was gambling—he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius' assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis' ally was was worth much more than gold.": "希瓦卡的父亲艾尔克德是基尔杜斯家族的长子，是瑞姆家族的盟友。艾尔克德的恶习之一是赌博，他从来不介意输钱，只要大家玩得开心就可以了。当他开始用基尔杜斯家族的资产来支付他的赌注时，问题就开始了。当他在经济上与基尔杜斯家族断绝关系时，他采取了一个步骤，将他最小的女儿希瓦卡献给奥本游戏的赢家。当艾尔克德输给了基尔杜斯家族的对手--瑞林泰尔家族的伊姆费恩时，希瓦卡被强行从她的家中带走。莱尔斯特拉提出抗议，但有太多可靠的证人见证了这场赌局，她的挑战对她的女主人来说是无法动摇的。因此，希瓦卡被里安泰尔家族收为奴隶。莱尔斯特拉试图从伊姆费恩那里买下希瓦卡，但被拒绝了，因为有一个与基尔杜斯家族的盟友讨价还价的筹码比黄金更有价值。",
	"Aside from the hard labor she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well—as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harbored a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child's life to another simply to cover a bet.": "除了她和其他许多人被迫忍受的苦役之外，希瓦卡受到了很好的待遇，反正是奴隶可以得到的待遇。她对自己被强迫的奴役坦然处之，因为她在生活中几乎从未掌握过任何重要的权力。然而，她对自己的父亲怀恨在心，不明白一个父母怎么能仅仅为了应付赌局而轻率地把自己孩子的生命交给别人。",
	"The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.": "伊姆芬家族的守卫对她的待遇并不比其他奴隶好或差。他们也没有禁止她的母亲在晚上偶尔去看她，只要不企图逃跑。然而，他们确实限制了她用她的工作锤敲打她的父亲，那是唯一一次她的父亲在打碎石块的工作中接近她。如果没有警卫，艾尔克德可能会暴毙，但可能不会很快。",
	"Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.": "希瓦克在拉伊尔斯特拉招募了大批追随者并实施了一个释放希瓦克的计划之前，几乎做了整整一年的奴隶：她和她的同伙将在夜间袭击奴隶营的伊姆芬族守卫，希瓦克将在混乱中逃跑，同时穿着伊姆芬族女巫的战衣。",
	"The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.": "攻击似乎是成功的，因为奴隶营中出现了混乱，然而，莱尔斯特拉没有预料到两件事：首先，守卫比预期的要多，随着攻击暴徒的进展，造成了更长的滞留和更多的伤亡。更多的守卫也意味着可以拉响警报，带来增援，这使现有的救援问题变得更加复杂。",
	"The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.": "第二个问题是，希瓦卡已经决定，无论她在乌鸦社会的什么地方，她都会被奴役。无论是到另一个家族还是在她自己的家族中，她都会被她的女主人和她自己的家族当作无数个计划中的一个棋子。作为最小的女儿，她的地位最低。正因为如此，她决心不回自己的家。",
	"Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well placed and spectacular looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.": "一旦拥有了伊姆芬战衣，希瓦卡就把附带的头罩拉到头上，开始带领奴隶们离开，利用她隐含的权力，加上一些精心布置的、看起来很壮观的咒语，使他们不受干扰。当他们离开Xdot边境时，她带着近一百名奴隶。",
	"Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of Leacim, the only known male drow deity.": "在夜色中带领他们前进，希瓦卡发现了一个狭窄的洞口，通向里面一个更大的洞穴。希瓦卡使用她最后的可用魔法，试图用一个显示坚硬岩石的幻象覆盖洞口。这个形象比希瓦克知道的要有效得多，因为她和她的团队已经吸引了唯一已知的男性鸦人神Leacim的注意。",
	"A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, Leacim took this opportunity to thumb his nose as his sisters and to have fun, watching at the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.": "作为更严肃的乌鸦女神中的一个捣蛋鬼，Leacim利用这个机会对他的姐妹们竖起大拇指，并从中获得乐趣，看着乌鸦巡逻队一遍又一遍地搜索这个地区，从未看穿他的幻觉。",
	"The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a savior. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim—knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.": "获救的奴隶们开始把希瓦卡当作救世主来崇拜。她拒绝了他们的赞美，说她只不过是另一个奴隶，和他们一样。Leacim知道这些奴隶需要一个可以仰望的人，于是在希瓦卡身上投入了少量的力量，使她高于凡人，但没有达到神圣的程度：他使她成为半神。",
	"Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.": "在她的保护下，那些人把他们的新家变成了一个叫Nhlilolin的小镇，它已经成为冥界弃儿的天堂。",
	"Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light gray hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but a steely resolve.": "希瓦卡是个矮个子，对于一个乌鸦来说，但由于她当过奴隶，肌肉发达。她的浅灰色头发对于一个女性乌鸦来说是很短的，头发的末端到达她的下颚线。她的眼睛是蓝色的，在冥界比较少见，如果你看着它，你会发现除了坚定的决心，什么都没有。",
	"Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the {@i mending} cantrip.": "希瓦卡的衣服很简单，喜欢有口袋的裤子和衬衫。口袋越多越好。她在任何地方都不会离开那把锤子，在带领其他奴隶进入黑夜之前，她曾用那把锤子砸断他们的锁链。每天早上或在任何战斗之后，她都会用{@i mending}的咒语修理木柄。",
	"Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a savior or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to Leacim, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.": "希瓦卡，作为一个新近的半神，并没有一个教堂，但那些从监狱中被救出来的人每天都在唱颂她。她淡化了自己作为救世主或被崇拜者的角色。她确实有她忠实的追随者，而且，由于利阿西姆，她能够授予他们少量的法术。不过，她没有获得任何圣骑士。",
	"Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clery in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.": "那些和希瓦卡一起逃出来的人是她最大的崇拜者，但任何逃脱了束缚的人都会自由地以敬畏的态度谈论她的名字。在尼罗林没有固定的教规，但一些使徒会到地下世界（和少数人到上层世界）去反对奴隶制，努力释放那些被压制的人，如果不是通过行动，也只是通过语言。",
	"Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.": "其中一些传教士会召集志同道合的人，试图释放被奴隶主抓走的人。这些狂热者不在乎自己的生死，只要那些被囚禁的人获得自由就好。",
	"{@i The Journey:} The only text that Hivaka doesn't simply shake her head at is {@i The Journey}. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.": "{@i The Journey:}希瓦卡唯一不简单摇头的文字是{@i The Journey}。这本羊皮纸集不仅是希瓦卡带领伊姆芬家族的奴隶们获得自由的故事，而且欢迎每一个从霸主手中逃出来的人将他们的故事加入《旅程》。到目前为止，已经有近三百个故事被放入了这本集子。",
	"A second \"holy text\" has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, {@i The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward}, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far.": "第二本 \"圣书 \"已经开始在整个尼罗林和地下世界流传，用最神圣的语言谈论希瓦卡，极大地夸大了她的能力，并几乎把她描绘成最终将推翻最强大的奴隶主纳兰尼斯本人的女神。希瓦卡曾试图解释说，这本书，（%0%），使人们注意到她和这个镇子，书中提到了这个镇子的名字，并可能导致他们都被抓回来。到目前为止，这种解释已经失败了。",
	"Considered by a vast majority of the native peoples of NairaCull to be she who controls the balance of life within their lands, the worship of Ja Qua is the dominant faith within the dark nation.": "绝大多数奈拉库尔的原住民认为她控制着他们土地上的生命平衡，对Ja Qua的崇拜是这个黑暗国家的主导性信仰。",
	"Ja Qua herself predates most written language, and her own followers have spent their entire lives passing down the tales told to them from previous generations, leaving her history entirely in the hands of those who revere her. Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.": "Ja Qua本身比大多数书面语言都要早，她的追随者一生都在传承前人告诉他们的故事，把她的历史完全掌握在那些敬仰她的人手中。她的追随者对她的真正起源知之甚少，只知道她已被证明是那些从未远离过古老崇拜形式的人生活中的一种积极而忠诚的精神力量。",
	"Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court, and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey have come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.": "贾-夸存在于一个与塞利王庭的主位面相连的次位面中，并与她的土地上的费伊人建立了深厚的关系，用与她的人类追随者同样的爱和关怀来看待他们。反过来，费伊人也将她视为自己人，并且是他们宫廷中受人敬重的人，并且会毫不犹豫地代表她在她的土地上进行互动。",
	"Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first being that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in color with spots that appear to shift and move before one's eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny color of her pelt within her long hair. The color of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true color exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.": "当Ja Qua选择出现时，她会以两种形态之一出现。第一种形态是一只巨大的、身体强壮的美洲豹，呈金黄色，身上的斑点似乎会在人们眼前移动。她的眉毛和鼻子上有一圈骨质突起，猫科动物形态下的贾夸是她的土地上自封的女王，这一点不会错。她的第二种形态是一种更微妙的形态，是一个有吸引力的女人，通常在她的长发中仍然保持着她皮毛的灰褐色。她的眼睛在人形时的颜色据说是无法形容的，因为自然界中不存在真正的颜色可以与之相比，她的声音在同一时刻既能引诱你，又能让你感到恐惧。",
	"Ja Qua's worship is strongest within the lands of NaeraCull, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanities connection to the Seelie Court yet.": "Ja Qua的崇拜在NaeraCull的土地上最为强烈，尽管在一些被遗忘的未开化的地方也有随机的圣地，在那里，进步的步伐还没有切断人类与塞利王庭的所有联系。",
	"{@b Worshippers and Clergy": "{@b 崇拜者和神职人员",
	"Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua's Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honor amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colorful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.": "那些被认为有价值的部落战士要通过一个仪式性的挑战来获得贾-夸的祝福，即狼人的天赋。那些在变身过程中幸存下来的人，没有被为证明自己的价值而必须经历的仪式性痛苦逼疯，他们在部落和神庙中处于荣誉地位，被用作守护者和猎手，保护信仰和古老的生活方式。这些战士只穿一件腰布，他们倾向于接受用五颜六色的饰品和小玩意装饰自己的习俗，以纪念对对手的胜利，或光荣的狩猎。",
	"Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.": "那些有足够的信仰，但没有体力作为战士为部落服务的人，作为Ja Qua忠诚的神职人员，照料Ja Qua的寺庙和祭坛。随着时间的推移，那些最虔诚的人开始获得某些猫科动物的特征，尽管他们从未像神庙的战士那样获得贾-夸的完全拥抱。",
	"Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumored that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.": "在整个丛林中散布着许多被遗忘的部落的遗迹，其中的壁雕和浮雕描绘了贾夸教会历史上各个时期的教义。奈拉库尔人的大部分书面语言都是象形文字，从未被编入文本或装订成册，尽管有传言说有个人在丛林中旅行，试图这样做。",
	"A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of Mohkba to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the Klavek Kingdom could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari...the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration": "西奥-德拉尔曼是一位颇有名气的先驱，他受莫克巴大学的委托，进入黑暗的丛林，了解当地人所祈求的神灵的一切，以及Klavek王国如何利用这些信息达到自己的目的。那是很多年前的事了，在遇到德拉曼的部落中，许多传说会让人相信，他的目标已经改变，他对知识的探索已经变得更加个人化。大多数传说都提到了一个带着大量伤疤的人，就好像他曾被打到死亡边缘，但却幸免于难，被指明了一条新路。他未完成的作品有几份罕见的副本，被信使和野生动物园的人带到了沿海城镇......他们被称为德拉曼文件。在Klavekian控制的土地上，所有公开拥有这些文件的行为都被认为是叛国行为，可被扣押财产和货物，并被监禁。",
	"The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos—when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.": "被称为Leacim的Aventyr神曾经是一个被遗忘的神灵，在它到达冥界之前就被胶体的行为所取代。他曾经是一个被珍视的狡猾和智慧之神，但他被遗弃在宇宙的虚空中--当Leacim注视着虚空时，来自遥远的地方的东西回瞪着他。现在，这个神有点精神错乱，没有身份，他带着意志和欲望在整个宇宙中游荡，任由他日益疯狂的情绪摆布。",
	"Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim's attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune—over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.": "最终，在 \"Dvergr的锻造 \"过程中在阿文泰尔所产生的神圣能量引起了Leacim的注意，他被吸引到世界的边缘，见证了祖先的崛起和堕入德拉基的过程。然而，最让这位不幸之神感兴趣的是精灵族的神灵--经过数百年的时间，他巧妙地渗入了他们的神殿和物种，在将他们传播到上层世界和地下世界之前，将狂热的信徒归于肉身之中。他莫名其妙地出现在精灵万神殿中，完全采用了乌鸦的形态，并在他们离开埃德隆德之前和之后都聚集了一些追随者。",
	"The most famous of these followers is Hivak, the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essence, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.": "这些追随者中最著名的是希瓦克，大众的救世主。当她和她的奴隶伙伴们逃离Xdot时，Leacim注意到了她。他向这个有抱负的黑暗精灵传授了他的一些神性精华，使她永远变成了一个半神。",
	"Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D'thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.": "利辛继续在乌鸦的持续存在中扮演着积极（尽管是暗中）的角色。他在冥界旅行，短暂地接触黑暗精灵的灵魂，并将他们的取向向混乱、中立甚至善良的方向转化，如果这符合他的心情的话。在霍洛特附近的真菌森林中，孤独的突袭者达图尔（D'thul）是一个食人的巫师--巴比伦人，他就是这样一个乌鸦。那些在表面上的人经常看到他们的生活受到诡计之神的微妙影响，而莱西姆将他们引向性质可疑的角色和意外的回报。",
	"Leacim takes delight in angering the other drow gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change—players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.": "Leacim以一有机会就激怒其他乌鸦神为乐；他的追随者可以将Leacim作为任何有乌鸦神性要求的物品、等级、特技或法术的必要神祗，如果他们可以使用领域，可以选择乌鸦领域。此外，他还经常创造自己的改变因素--如果玩家希望在一个原本禁止选择的地方扮演一个善良的鸦人，可以选择Leacim作为他们的神灵，以避免这种限制。",
	"The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim's clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and black-lacquered shortbow across his back, in female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.": "诡计多端的神有许多伪装，但他最常出现的是一个穿着和蔼可亲的男性半乌鸦，带着诱人的笑容，或者是一个金发碧眼的人类女孩，无论哪种形式，都有一双刺眼的蓝眼睛。莱西姆的衣服一般都很时髦，适合环境，尽管有时略显破烂，似乎处于失修状态。他随意地踱步，似乎无忧无虑，身旁放着一把弯刀，黑漆短弓横在身后，在女性形态下，他只携带一把单刀作为武器，抛出后总是回到他身边。",
	"Leacim doesn't have proper churches—effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).": " 这些神龛通常被制作成属于其他神灵的样子，只有在进行正确的祈祷时才会显示它们的真实形态。追随者如果不能通过DC28知识（宗教）检查，就会发现他们的神在这些神龛上祈祷后对他们不满，尽管他们仍然不确定原因（不管他们施了什么占卜法术）。",
	"{@i Leacim's Lexicon} is a treasured tome among thieves' guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god's followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provides a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.": "{@i Leacim's Lexicon}是盗贼行会、隐藏的乌鸦飞地和诡计多端的神的追随者们所珍视的手稿。对于其他神的追随者来说，这些书就像一本不起眼的生活日志（DC26智慧救赎来否定），但在一个虔诚的信徒手中，它提供了一个学习任何流氓伎俩、幻术的手段，或者获得需要偷袭作为前提条件的声望等级的知识。",
	"According to the Yerek, Musta'Vohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce. Once she made the universe, she created light and dark, warm and cold, up and down, and every planet, person, animal, and plant. They say that she birthed the other gods as well. Even now, she continues to produce new lifeforms.": "根据Yerek的说法，Musta'Vohi从纯粹的繁衍意愿中创造了宇宙。一旦她创造了宇宙，她就创造了光明和黑暗，温暖和寒冷，向上和向下，以及每个星球、人、动物和植物。他们说她也孕育了其他的神。即使是现在，她还在继续生产新的生命体。",
	"Musta'Vohi appears as a stout matronly woman with graying blonde hair who always appears slightly tired, but her eyes are always filled with lust. She wears a simple brown shawl over a simple brown cloak that has the hood pulled back. Her feet are bare and her hands are always opening and closing, as if trying to grasp something.": "Musta'Vohi出现时是一个粗壮的女护士，她有一头灰白的金发，总是显得略微疲惫，但她的眼睛总是充满了欲望。她穿着一件简单的棕色披肩，外面罩着一件简单的棕色斗篷，斗篷向后拉。她的脚是赤裸的，她的手总是开开合合，似乎想抓住什么。",
	"There is no physical church of Musta'Vohi. Any place where a man and woman couple together is considered a holy place during the actual coupling, but loses this status when the pair separate.": "Musta'Vohi没有实体教堂。在实际联姻期间，任何有一对男女在一起的地方都被认为是圣地，但当这对男女分开时就失去了这种地位。",
	"All of the Yerek worship Musta'Vohi, but only women are considered \"clergy\" because of their ability to become pregnant. A young woman is inducted into the clergy when she can bear children and earns the title \"Daughter.\" Women who have already given birth have the title \"Mother.\" Women who are no longer able to give birth are called \"Matron,\" and the oldest woman in the tribe has the title \"Grandmother.\" ": "所有的Yerek人都崇拜Musta'Vohi，但只有女性被认为是 \"神职人员\"，因为她们能够怀孕。年轻女性在能够生育时被纳入神职人员行列，并获得 \"女儿 \"的称号。已经生育的妇女有 \"母亲 \"的称号。不再能生育的妇女被称为 \"母\"，部落中最年长的妇女有 \"祖母 \"的称号。",
	"During each new moon, the newest Daughter is anointed in purified oils and sacrifices the most recently born male child to Musta'Vohi. After this ceremony, all Daughters are taken to the Grandmother to learn the ways of pregnancy and motherhood.": "在每个新月期间，最新的女儿要用净化的油涂抹，并将最近出生的男婴献给穆斯塔沃希。在这个仪式之后，所有的女儿都被带到祖母那里，学习怀孕和做母亲的方法。",
	"None. All of Musta'Vohl's teachings are passed down verbally from Grandmother to the Matrons.": "没有。Musta'Vohl的所有教义都是由祖母口口相传给母校的。",
	"According to the elves, from the beginning, during the Prime Event that created the cosmos, there has been light. This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.": "根据精灵们的说法，从一开始，在创造宇宙的主要事件中，就有了光。这种光既温暖了宇宙，又打击了同样出现的黑暗。这道光，既是保护性的，也是攻击性的，体现在纳奈斯身上。她既是叶母又是战士之母。",
	"Naneth (NAH neth), her sister Naraneus, and their brother Onael created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.": "纳奈斯（NAH neth）、她的姐姐纳兰努斯（Naraneus）和他们的弟弟奥奈尔（Onael）创造了第一批精灵。纳奈斯安慰和温暖了精灵们，但她也教他们如何保护自己。她向他们展示了对彼此和自己的关怀，但他们只有彼此的依靠。随着精灵们的进化，她更像是他们的母亲，抵消了纳兰努斯的混乱存在，而奥奈尔则渐渐远离了这个家庭。",
	"Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Naneth's mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.": "最终，Naraneus嫉妒Naneth的母性，开始了两人之间的争斗，这场争斗将持续数年，最终也包括了精灵，两个群体选择了一个神灵来跟随。Naraneus输了，追随她的精灵们被驱逐出了Edhellond。",

She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within Edhellond, the Silent Forest.": "战争结束后，纳奈斯反思了纳兰努斯的欺骗行为。她决定，如果她不能信任自己的妹妹，她的孩子也不能信任其他人。她指示族长完全撤退到埃德隆德（Edhellond），即寂静森林。",

There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.": "Naneth教导精灵们，他们只能依靠自己获得一切。没有贸易，没有信息交流，不允许使者进入埃德隆，只有那些执行有利于精灵社会的秘密任务的人才能从埃德隆冒险出去。",
	"Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armor and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way.

	"Storjeger was once the greatest hunter of the Vikmordere Skykosh tribe. In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadn't realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lord's death.": "斯托尔杰格曾经是维克莫德尔-斯凯科什部落最伟大的猎手。在太阳神带来土地变暖后的那段时间，Storjeger带领着无数的猎人进入森林，在那里他们杀死了许多动物。在土地变暖的赏赐中，他们没有意识到他们过度捕猎，使土地失去平衡。这导致了在太阳神死后土地开始变冷时，缺乏游戏。",
	"As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.": "由于在严冬中缺乏食物，部落开始萎缩，Storjeger和其他部落的人一样瘦弱，独自进入森林寻找他能找到的食物。几个小时后，他发现了一只长着令人印象深刻的犄角的大鹿。他悄悄地靠近，双手因饥饿而颤抖，扔出了他的标枪。它严重失误，但这只鹿没有冲进树林，而是转身看着斯托尔杰格。",
	"The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.": "雄鹿转过身来，慢慢地走进树林，斯托尔杰格紧随其后。跟着鹿又走了一个小时，Storjeger已经把他带到了树林中一个他从未去过的地方。在远处，他看到一群鹿，数量有几十只，还有许多小鹿。他准备好了他的标枪，但他跟踪的那只鹿看了看他，然后跪了下来，放下了它的头。它身边有三只母鹿，每个人都跪下来，向斯托尔杰格献上自己的脖子。",
	"Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.": "斯托尔杰格拔出刀，感谢鹿的牺牲，杀死了这四头鹿。他给自己拿了几小块肉，以维持他回去的旅程。他拿出一个大袋子，把三只鹿捆在里面，把袋子系在腰带上。雄鹿则被他扛在肩上，以示尊重。",
	"He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didn't happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.": "他含着眼泪走回了斯凯科什部落，因为他知道他可以为他的人民提供服务。在回来的路上，斯托尔杰格意识到，他的人民必须与森林中的动物平衡相处，以确保这种情况不会再次发生。由于部落陷入这样的困境有一部分是他的错，所以斯托尔杰格决心保护森林的平衡。",
	"Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.": "回到他的部落后，他交付了那只鹿，并解释了所发生的事情和他所看到的情况以及对平衡的理解。他拿起雄鹿的头，用它做了一个面具，用皮做了一件外套。斯托尔杰格没有再说什么，就走出了村子，进入了众神的领域，使斯托尔杰格这个名字成为生存的代名词，并披上了猎神的衣钵。",
	"Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stag's head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.": "斯托尔杰格（STOR jay ger）几乎总是以一只巨大的麋鹿出现，但有时也会表现为一个中等身高的瘦小战士，长着雄鹿的头和角。他背上背着几支标枪，用Yggdrasil制成的长弓，以及三支箭，每支箭都很独特，威力巨大。",
	"Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the Vikmordere, but in a very brief period before the Klavekians went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

	"Born of a single drop from the Elemental Plane of Water, Vasi came to Aventyr by sheer luck when the original four elementals collided in the vast empty abyss of space. Unaware of her true power and acting only of universal impulse, Vasi embraced earth, fire, and air, to create Aventyr itself, and through this formation, the freshwater with which to rain down and cover the world. While others would end up as caretakers over the brackish depths where earth and water bled too deeply together, Vasi was the guardian of it all.": "瓦西诞生于水元素界的一滴水，当最初的四个元素在空旷的太空深渊中碰撞时，她完全是靠运气来到了阿文泰尔。瓦西不知道自己的真正力量，只凭着普遍的冲动行事，她拥抱了土、火和空气，创造了阿文泰尔本身，并通过这种形成，创造了淡水，用它来降下雨水，覆盖世界。当其他人最终成为咸水深处的看守者时，瓦西是这一切的守护者，那里的土和水流得太深了。",
	"After she adopted to the needs of those mortals living in Aventyr, and after the Shard of the Sun nearly collided with the planet, Vasi took to caring for those lacking water, sending her clergy into the {@link Scorched Lands|https://adventureaweek.com/campaign-setting/locations/scorched-lands/} to find, save, and possibly convert those who would surely have died in the desert wastes.": "在她接受了那些生活在阿文泰尔的凡人的需求之后，在太阳碎片几乎与这个星球相撞之后，瓦西开始照顾那些缺水的人，派她的神职人员进入{@link Scorched Lands|https://adventureaweek.com/campaign-setting/locations/scorched-lands/}寻找、拯救，并可能改变那些肯定会死在沙漠荒原的人。",

Worshippers are many and their influence spread far and wide in Aventyr, for all need water to survive.": "瓦西的神殿和庙宇都在深山峡谷和偏远的山间湖泊附近，只要有干净的淡水来源，附近就会有一个小神殿。崇拜者很多，他们的影响在阿文泰尔传播得很广，因为所有人都需要水来生存。",

While outsiders are welcome to cradle in the Tears of the Eternal Bath for a time, they are eventually asked to stay and become priests or leave, back to the world from whence they came.": "崇敬湖泊女神的人经常帮助其他需要水的人，并为他们提供安全的庇护所，使他们免受世界的恐怖之苦。虽然欢迎外来者在永恒之浴的眼泪中摇篮一段时间，但他们最终会被要求留下来，成为祭司，或者离开，回到他们来的世界。",
	"{@i The Mi'unin} is a tome born during the reign of the Grekians and when recited by each of the 92 high priests of Vasi at once, in all 92 shrines, and in unison for 92 days and 92 nights, brings about The Great Flood. An event which, in the past, covered large sections of Aventyr in water and even caused the level of the seas to rise.": "{@i The Mi'unin}是一本诞生于希腊人统治时期的巨著，当瓦西的92位大祭司在所有的92个神殿中同时诵读，并在92天92夜中齐声诵读时，会带来大洪水。在过去，这一事件将阿文泰尔的大部分地区覆盖在水中，甚至导致海平面上升。",
	"This otherworldly god is much like the hoyrall once were—a massive hive mind. More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god's origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the hoyrall, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.": "这个异世界的神很像曾经的hoyrall--一个巨大的蜂巢思想。比起身体上的存在，当虫族开始主宰这个外星神的起源星球时，扎格奈斯表现为他们死者的凝结意识。当那个世界上的其他智能生命体进行英勇的斗争时，在一个神性的存在指挥着hoyrall的种族蜂巢思想的情况下，他们很快就统治了昆虫之神所能感知的一切。",
	"Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical for into Aventyr—Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall—directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime's skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.": "直到大分裂的发生。祖先们从曾经的神话形态被打倒在地，变成了现在被称为德拉基的卑微种族，他们向宇宙发出了绝望的呼喊，而正是扎格奈斯回应了他们的请求。昆虫之神从整个种族的完全奉献中获得了难以想象的力量，他将自己的全部身体运到了阿文泰尔-扎格尼，连同数以万计的海拉尔--直接穿越宇宙，进入了德拉基的头颅，瞬间杀死了这个德拉基的怪物。",
	"For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.": "在几代人的时间里，Exis继续在Aventyr上指挥它的孩子们，在hoyrall的堡垒-蜂巢中发展了一支庞大的军队，准备全面进攻，征服地表和地下世界。如果不是在汇合期间胶体的干预，它肯定会成功的。另一个外星实体抓住了埃克塞斯（Exis）通往其子女的通道，打破了hoyrall的蜂巢思维，并将其物理对应物扎格恩（Zagn）送入阿文泰尔的海洋，对其遇到的一切进行破坏。",
	"Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers.

As she grew and matured, Lady Luck found that she could control the outcome of events, especially those of a chaotic and free nature simply by willing it so, and it wasn't long before those in perilous and astounding situations would begin to call upon her for help.
