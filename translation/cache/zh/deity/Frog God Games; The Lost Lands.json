	"Archeillus once stood below only {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} himself in the pantheon of the ancient Kingdoms of Foere. Though the first overking, Macobert, claimed familial descent from the sea god Quell, it was by virtue of the laws and customs of Archeillus that he claimed rightful rule over all the kingdoms and their client states. Despite these once heady heights of influence across the whole of Akados, with the decline of Foere, so too has the worship of Archeillus seen its decline. This has arguably been furthered by the slow increase of support for the foreign deity {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} as the divine patron of the Foerdewaith sovereignty, a trend whose beginnings can be traced back to the time of the great, great, grandson of Macobert, Osbert II, some seven centuries ago.": "在古老的Foere王国的万神殿中，Archeillus曾经仅次于（%0%）自己。尽管第一任国王Macobert声称自己是海神奎尔的家族后裔，但他凭借Archeillus的法律和习俗，声称自己有权统治所有的王国和他们的客户国家。尽管在整个阿卡多斯的影响力曾经达到了令人振奋的高度，但随着福尔的衰落，对阿克希琉斯的崇拜也出现了衰退。可以说，对外国神灵（1%）作为Foerdewaith主权的神圣守护者的支持缓慢增加，进一步加剧了这种情况，这种趋势可以追溯到大约七个世纪前Macobert的曾孙Osbert II的时代。",
	"Still an important god of the Foerdewaith, his religion is now often seen as old-fashioned or outdated, though he remains revered among many of the old noble families, especially in the more backwater areas. This devotion often even includes noble families that are not of Foerdewaith descent or rulers of lands outside Foere's sphere of influence. This is in large part because veneration of Archeillus is traditionally seen as a support of the current ruling class and serves to justify maintenance of the status quo of power among adherents. As a result of this common understanding, despite the fact that Archeillus is inherently a god of law and good, his religion is used by many a less-benign tyrant as means to consolidate and hold power with a veneer of legitimacy. The established church of Archeillus officially finds this practice repellant but also finds it prudent to not try and identify those who should or should not rule because of the inherent risk of opposing a true believer who has merely been mischaracterized by his subjects or, even worse, finding themselves forced to choose sides and ending up on the losing end of a political power struggle.": "他仍然是Foerdewaith的一个重要的神，他的宗教现在常常被看作是老式的或过时的，尽管他在许多古老的贵族家庭中仍然受到尊敬，特别是在比较落后的地区。这种虔诚甚至常常包括那些没有Foerdewaith血统的贵族家庭或Foere影响范围之外的土地统治者。这在很大程度上是因为对Archeillus的崇拜在传统上被视为对当前统治阶级的支持，并为维持信徒中的权力现状提供了理由。由于这种共同的理解，尽管阿克希琉斯本质上是一个法律和善的神，但他的宗教被许多不那么良善的暴君用来作为巩固和掌握权力的手段，披上合法的外衣。阿克希琉斯的官方教会认为这种做法令人厌恶，但也认为谨慎的做法是不要试图确定那些应该或不应该统治的人，因为反对一个仅仅被他的臣民错误描述的真正的信徒的内在风险，或者更糟糕的是，发现自己被迫选边站，最终在政治权力斗争中落败。",
	"With its loss in influence over the last few centuries and the inevitable reduction in the number of followers, the clergy of Archeillus has learned to step carefully and walk a fine line between clearly upholding the morality and rule of just law represented by Archeillus and stepping cautiously to avoid upsetting the apple cart of local politics that could result in them being completely removed from the halls of power and spheres of influence altogether. Many priests of Archeillus take comfort in the oft-quoted axiom, \"he that rules does so but by the will of Archeillus,\" allowing responsibility for the issue of rightful rulership to fall squarely upon the shoulders of the god himself. They trust that Archeillus's wisdom will sort out the details rather than muddying the waters by the machinations and inevitable disasters wrought by imperfect mortals, which is perhaps what the god has intended all along.": "在过去的几个世纪里，随着影响力的下降，追随者的数量也不可避免地减少，Archeillus的神职人员已经学会了小心翼翼，在明确维护Archeillus所代表的道德和公正的法律规则与谨慎行事以避免扰乱当地政治的苹果车，从而导致他们被完全从权力大厅和影响范围中移除。许多Archeillus的祭司对经常被引用的公理感到欣慰，\"统治者只是按照Archeillus的意愿行事\"，让合法统治权问题的责任完全落在神本身的肩上。他们相信Archeillus的智慧会理清细节，而不是通过不完美的凡人的阴谋和不可避免的灾难来搅浑水，这也许是神一直以来的意图。",
	"Belon appears to his worshippers as an elderly man wearing flowing white robes and carrying a walking staff. Belon is the embodiment of things learned upon the road, be they magical or mundane knowledge.Priests of Belon often serve as guides, educating themselves in local customs in order to afford better traveling conditions for those in their care. As such, Belon is patron of both journeys and knowledge, exemplified in the wisdom that can be gained by being well traveled. An emphasis on common sense ensures that he finds adherents among the stolid common folk of the world rather than only the scholars and learned.": "贝隆出现在他的崇拜者面前时，是一位身穿飘逸的白袍、手持拐杖的老人。贝隆是在路上学到的东西的化身，不管是魔法还是世俗的知识。贝隆的牧师经常充当向导，对当地的习俗进行教育，以便为他们照顾的人提供更好的旅行条件。因此，贝隆既是旅行的守护神，也是知识的守护神，通过旅行获得的智慧就是最好的证明。对常识的强调确保了他在这个世界上呆板的普通人中找到追随者，而不仅仅是学者和学问家。",
	"Belon the Wise was not originally a god of the Hyperborean or Foerdewaith pantheons. He seems to have been an Eastern god of some as yet unidentified Libynosi pantheon. Some scholars speculate that he was a lesser god of the Gohtra of Far Jaati. Other evidence seems to suggest that he was perhaps once an apprentice to Thasizier, the Libynosi Master of Good Magic and ancient enemy of the witch-goddess Hecate. Whatever his origin, it seems likely that Belon became introduced to the folk of Akados after having been carried back home by Foerdewaith crusaders sojourning in eastern realms.": "智者贝隆最初并不是海伯利安或福尔德瓦伊斯万神殿的神。他似乎是某个尚未确定的Libynosi万神殿的东方神。一些学者推测，他是远在贾蒂的戈特拉的一个较小的神。其他证据似乎表明，他也许曾经是塔西泽的学徒，塔西泽是利比诺西族的善法大师，也是女巫赫卡特的古老敌人。不管他的出身如何，贝隆似乎很可能是在被旅居东方王国的福尔德怀斯十字军携带回国后被介绍给阿卡多斯的居民的。",
	"Belon's earliest influence in Akados seems to have been in and around the city of Bard's Gate where he enjoyed some popularity as a god of travel among a burgeoning city of merchants and travelers. Over time, however, his worship waned in favor of other gods that hold mercantilism and commerce among their areas of interest, deities such as Sefagreth and Tykee. Recently, however, the church of Belon has been on the rise again as interest in him as a god of arcane knowledge who can perhaps provide secrets of the ancient magic of the East. Less a travelers' god, it is now more in vogue for wizards who consider themselves to be sophisticated and well-traveled to venerate the White Wanderer. This upsurge has been noticed by the clergy of the traditional god of magic Jamboor, and discussions about what to do among that god's scholars have been going on for years now as more and more practitioners of the arcane arts turn to Belon as their patron.": "贝隆在阿卡多斯最早的影响似乎是在巴德门城及其周围，在那里他作为一个新兴的商人和旅行者城市的旅行之神享有一定的知名度。然而，随着时间的推移，他的崇拜逐渐减弱，转而支持其他对重商主义和商业感兴趣的神灵，如Sefagreth和Tykee。然而，最近贝隆教会再次兴起，因为人们对他的兴趣是，他是一位奥术知识之神，也许能提供东方古老魔法的秘密。他不再是旅行者的神，现在更多的是那些认为自己是成熟的、善于旅行的巫师们对白色流浪者的崇敬，这是一种时尚。传统的魔法之神Jamboor的神职人员已经注意到了这股热潮，随着越来越多的奥术从业者将贝隆作为他们的守护神，该神的学者之间关于如何做的讨论已经持续了多年。",
	"Ceres is an old goddess of the Hyperborean pantheon who has protected home and hearth since the earliest recorded histories. She is seen as a motherly figure who protects her followers and their communities through gentle guidance and nurturing. It is also she who the common folk turn to in prayer to avoid famine from a bad harvest or natural calamities. Though not really a goddess of crops and weather like the god {@deity Telophus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Telophus}, her holy writings and liturgy do universally speak of a bountiful harvest to fill the bellies of the community and the needy.": "瑟雷斯是海伯利安神殿的一位古老的女神，自最早的历史记录以来，她一直保护着家庭和炉灶。她被看作是一个母亲般的人物，通过温和的指导和养育来保护她的追随者和他们的社区。普通人也会向她祈祷，以避免因歉收或自然灾害造成的饥荒。虽然她并不像天神（%0%）那样是庄稼和天气的女神，但她的圣书和礼仪确实普遍提到了丰收，以填补社区和穷人的肚子。",
	"More concerned with the benign use of the harvest from the standpoint of community well-being and stability rather than being seen as a matron of plant growth in general, Ceres is one of the few deities whose worship involves active benevolence in the form of feeding and sheltering the needy. She is revered by many who are not truly her worshippers (hence her title of \"Revered Mother\") because she is seen as the divine caretaker and overseer of healthy births, though she shares this role with the goddess {@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya}. So even those who venerate other gods or are even diametrically opposed to her through alignment or creed are not above uttering short prayer in her name at the birth of their own offspring. In her hands lies the well-being of the next generation, which all humans recognize and generally respect. That her followers are not crusaders or violent radicals seeking to bring judgment in her name makes this veneration by others more palatable.": "瑟雷斯更关注从社区福祉和稳定的角度出发对收获的良性利用，而不是被视为一般植物生长的母亲，她是少数几个其崇拜涉及积极仁慈的神灵之一，其形式是喂养和庇护有需要的人。她受到许多并非真正崇拜她的人的尊敬（因此她被称为 \"尊敬的母亲\"），因为她被看作是神圣的照顾者和健康生育的监督者，尽管她与女神（%0%）分享这一角色。因此，即使是那些崇敬其他神灵的人，甚至是通过结盟或信条与她截然相反的人，也不至于在自己的后代出生时以她的名义进行简短的祈祷。她掌握着下一代的福祉，所有人类都承认并普遍尊重这一点。她的追随者不是以她的名义寻求审判的十字军或暴力激进分子，这使得其他人对她的崇敬更容易被接受。",
	"For all of these qualities and that of providing succor to the sick, Ceres is often seen as the glue that holds families and communities together.The few hospices that exist for the indigent or those unable to afford the services of a personal physician are almost always established by her worshippers.Despite her recognized benevolence, Ceres is seen as somewhat rustic, and has been in decline in some urban centers. She retains her popularity and influence in the countryside among the simple folk, however.The halfling matron goddess Hester serves as her handmaiden, and many rural halflings revere Ceres as well as a result.": "由于所有这些特质以及为病人提供救助的特质，瑟雷斯经常被视为维系家庭和社区的粘合剂。然而，她在乡下简单的民众中仍然保持着她的知名度和影响力。半身人的母神海丝特作为她的女仆，许多乡下半身人也因此而崇敬瑟雷斯。",
	"The father of all elves and firstborn of the race, Darach-Albith is portrayed as a handsome elven male draped in a cloak of forest green leaves.His skin varies at different times between the gleaming white of birch bark and any shades of brown or green found in primeval woodlands. Darach has keen golden eyes like those of an owl. His sword Tian Tu Lan and his bow Fayar Nocht are said to never miss a target and to slay those of evil intent instantly.": "达拉赫-阿尔比斯是所有精灵的父亲和种族的长子，他被描绘成一个英俊的精灵男性，披着森林绿叶的斗篷。他的皮肤在不同时期会有变化，有的是白桦树皮的闪亮白色，有的是原始林地的褐色或绿色阴影。达拉赫有一双像猫头鹰一样的敏锐的金色眼睛。他的剑 \"天图蓝 \"和他的弓 \"法雅尔-诺赫特 \"据说从未错过目标，并能立即杀死那些心怀不轨的人。",
	"The ruler of the elven pantheon, almost all elves at least pay Darach-Albith lip service if not outright veneration. Though his religion is very ancient and steeped in many-layered tradition and ritual, to most non-elves he is known primarily for his legendary search for his wife Rialae-Aibaru (known as the Lost Queen of the Elves) who abandoned him and her duties in the elven pantheon to seek out her missing daughter Karelis sometime back in the mists of time. There are entire sects of elves who venerate the Lost Queen and her search through the rare appearances of the blue comet Rialae, though Darach-Albith for his part seems to remain stoic in the face of his unending grief.": "作为精灵万神殿的统治者，几乎所有的精灵都至少对达拉赫-阿尔比斯给予口头上的尊敬，如果不是直接的敬仰。虽然他的宗教是非常古老的，并浸泡在多层次的传统和仪式中，但对大多数非精灵来说，他主要是因寻找他的妻子瑞亚莱-艾巴鲁（被称为失落的精灵女王）的传奇故事而闻名，她抛弃了他和她在精灵万神殿的职责，在时间的迷雾中寻找她失踪的女儿卡蕾斯。有一些精灵教派通过蓝色彗星Rialae的罕见出现来敬仰失落的女王和她的寻找，尽管达拉赫-阿尔比斯在面对他无尽的悲伤时似乎仍然很坚强。",
	"Dre'uain appears as a clubfooted gnome with strong but fine-fingered hands. His flame-red hair and beard always appear singed from his labors over the forge. He has a long nose and piercingly curious eyes and wears a soot-covered apron. Hammer Mittelschmerz claims to have learned all he knows of crafting and invention from Dre'uain.": "Dre'uain是一个棒足侏儒，有一双强壮但细指的手。他火红的头发和胡须总是因为在锻炉上的劳作而显得焦黄。他有一个长长的鼻子和一双好奇的眼睛，身穿一条覆盖着煤灰的围裙。汉默-米特施默茨声称他从德雷乌恩那里学到了所有的工艺和发明知识。",
	"Considered by many to be one of the oldest deities, Dre'uain embodies the creative mind and its ability to fashion objects and devices. Dre'uain is honored by creators, inventors, smiths, architects, and other craftsfolk of all races. His connection to earthquakes, volcanoes, and other seismic events seem to be a holdover from his earliest days as a mighty giant and arth deity. In that capacity early myths say that he battled the primordial earth spirit Demogorgon for supremacy. The result of the battle was the crippling of Dre'uain and the reduction to his current stature as well as his loss of mastery over the earth, turning instead to mastery of its resources in invention and crafting. Demogorgon faired perhaps worse, losing his mastery over the earth in exchange for knowledge of its deepest secrets instead but at the cost of having his psyche split into two competing halves and being cast into the Ginnungagap.": "许多人认为Dre'uain是最古老的神灵之一，它体现了创造性的思维及其塑造物体和设备的能力。Dre'uain受到所有种族的创造者、发明家、铁匠、建筑师和其他手工艺人的敬重。他与地震、火山和其他地震事件的联系，似乎是他最早作为一个强大的巨人和神灵时的遗留问题。在早期的神话中，他曾与原始大地之灵德摩戈根争夺霸主地位。战斗的结果是Dre'uain被打成了残废，他的身材也下降到了现在的水平，同时他也失去了对地球的控制，转而在发明和工艺方面掌握了地球的资源。德摩根的情况可能更糟，他失去了对地球的控制权，以换取对地球最深层秘密的了解，但代价是他的精神分裂成两个相互竞争的部分，并被投进了金农格普。",
	"Since then Dre'uain has succeeded in one of the most difficult tasks in all the multiverse; he was a gnome god who ascended to a position of respect and major worship among humans, with many adherents among dwarves and halflings as well. While dwarven crafters and inventors are more likely to venerate Dwerfater or Crugas and Dre'uain has not been adopted into the Dwarven Pantheon as a result, there are still a fair number of dwarven craftsmen and smiths who prefer to follow his faith than the more magically oriented tenants of Crugas or the distinctly racial patronage of Dwerfater, especially among the hill dwarves who work more closely with other races.": "从那时起，Dre'uain成功地完成了整个多元宇宙中最困难的任务之一；他是一个地精之神，在人类中登上了受人尊敬和主要崇拜的地位，在矮人和半身人中也有很多信徒。虽然矮人工匠和发明家更倾向于崇敬德维尔法特或克鲁加斯，德雷乌因也没有因此被纳入矮人万神殿，但仍有相当数量的矮人工匠和铁匠喜欢追随他的信仰，而不是克鲁加斯那种更偏重于魔法的租户或德维尔法特那种明显的种族赞助，特别是在与其他种族合作更密切的山地矮人中。",
	"Among humans, Dre'uain not only receives veneration among inventors, craftsmen, and smiths, but his propensity for hard work and virtue of honest labors has endeared him to all manner of manual laborers. Many such laborers follow Stryme, seeing the work of the god of strength in their labors, but for those whose work is less reliant upon physical prowess and more reliant on dogged determination or dedication to tedious or repetitive tasks, Dre'uain strikes a chord. The laborers or many manufactories turn to Dre'uain for their common beliefs and has resulted in the formation of labor unions in some locales.": "在人类中，Dre'uain不仅受到发明家、工匠和铁匠的崇敬，而且他的勤劳倾向和诚实劳动的美德使他受到各种体力劳动者的喜爱。许多这样的劳动者追随斯特里姆，在他们的劳动中看到了力量之神的工作，但对于那些工作不太依赖体力，而更依赖顽强的决心或对繁琐或重复性工作的奉献的人来说，德雷乌恩会引起他们的共鸣。劳动者或许多工厂因其共同的信仰而求助于Dre'uain，并在一些地方形成了劳工联盟。",
	"The presence of Dre'uain's own clubbed foot as a model, and the tendency of some of his followers to unionize has created a following of maimed workers among his followers. This has likewise contributed to a growing number of wounded veteran soldiers among those who follow him, turning away from their former soldier gods in their disability and looking instead to Dre'uain to sustain them. An unexpected side effect of this is that an ever-growing number of beggars—crippled and healthy alike—are beginning to flock to faith. This latest development has created a great deal of discomfort and growing resentment among his clergy because many of these beggars are seen as individuals who eschew hard work in favor of the charity of others, which flies in the face of the very tenants of Dre'uain. Despite many temples openly preaching against the sin of sloth to discourage this or any affiliation with those they see as ne'er-do-wells, any number of almshouses and soup kitchens continue to pop up in Dre'uian's name, though not formally associated with actual members of the clergy. The church hierarchy has yet to come up with a good solution to this situation and are divided as to whether a solution is even necessary.": "Dre'uain自己被打伤的脚作为模型的存在，以及他的一些追随者加入工会的倾向，在他的追随者中产生了一批伤残工人。这也同样促成了追随他的人中有越来越多的受伤老兵，他们在残疾中背弃了以前的兵神，转而寻找德雷乌安来支撑他们。这方面的一个意想不到的副作用是，越来越多的乞丐--不管是瘸子还是健康人，都开始涌向信仰。这个最新的发展在他的神职人员中造成了很大的不适和越来越多的怨恨，因为这些乞丐中的许多人被视为放弃辛勤工作而支持他人的慈善事业的人，这与德鲁瓦因的租户相抵触。尽管许多寺庙公开宣扬反对懒惰的罪过，以阻止这种行为或与他们认为是不务正业的人的任何联系，但任何数量的救济院和施舍所仍然以德雷乌安的名义出现，尽管没有正式与神职人员的实际成员联系。教会高层还没有想出一个很好的办法来解决这种情况，而且对于是否有必要解决也存在分歧。",
	"Dre'uain is frequently associated with the elven deity known as Wayland the Smith (Weland the Smith among the Tuatha De Pantheon). Many assume they are the same god by different names and in different aspects.The dwarves vehemently deny any suggestion of this, and the churches of Dre'uain and Wayland maintain themselves as entirely separate entities. If there is a connection between Dre'uain and Wayland, neither deity has deigned to comment.": "Dre'uain经常与被称为Wayland the Smith的精灵神（Tuatha De Pantheon中的Weland the Smith）联系起来。许多人认为他们是同一个神，只是名字不同，表现形式也不同。矮人坚决否认任何这种说法，而且德雷乌安和韦兰德的教会保持自己是完全独立的实体。如果Dre'uain和Wayland之间有什么联系，这两个神祗都没有发表意见。",
	"Dre'uain's temples always contain an altar composed of large metal gears intended to represent the eternal mechanisms of the cosmos, which Dre'uain is said to understand and perhaps even serve as caretaker over.True members of Dre'uain's clergy can be identified by their ability to disassemble the interlocking cogs of Dre'uain's holy symbols or connect them back together. This secret, known as the \"Blessing of Dre'uain\", is given to them directly from the god. Others who attempt to do so must make a successful DC 45 Disable Device check.": "Dre'uain的庙宇总是包含一个由大型金属齿轮组成的祭坛，旨在代表宇宙的永恒机制，据说Dre'uain了解这些机制，甚至可能担任看守人。Dre'uain神职人员的真正成员可以通过他们拆解Dre'uain神圣符号的联锁齿轮或将它们重新连接起来的能力来识别。这个秘密被称为 \"Dre'uain的祝福\"，是神直接赐予他们的。其他试图这样做的人必须成功地进行DC45禁用设备检查。",
	"The Father has existed as long as there has been life on the world now known as Lloegyr and has often been associated as an embodiment of the world itself or its primordial oceans. He has been known by many names through the ages, The Father simply being the most universal and enduring. To the ancient Phoromyceans who knew of him only through their own ancient legends, he was known as the Demiurge. To the Hyperboreans, who came along an age later, he was known as Boros and represented the planet upon which they lived as well as their home continent to the north. To the ancient peoples of the North before the coming of the Northlanders he was Buri, the grandfather of Wotan. To the Khemitite priest-kings of old he was Nun. The even more ancient Ashurians called him Engur or Abzu. The most ancient writings of Far Jaati refer to him as Dyaus Pitra, and to the Ancient Folk of Akados he was Lir.": "只要有生命存在于现在被称为Lloegyr的世界上，天父就一直存在，并经常被认为是世界本身或其原始海洋的化身。古往今来，他有许多名字，父亲只是最普遍和最持久的名字。对于那些只通过自己的古老传说了解他的古代弗罗米修斯人来说，他被称为Demiurge。对于晚了一个时代的Hyperboreans来说，他被称为Boros，代表着他们生活的星球以及他们在北方的家园大陆。对于北地人到来之前的北方古人来说，他是布瑞，沃坦的祖父。对于古老的赫米特祭司国王来说，他是努恩。更加古老的阿舒尔人称他为恩古尔或阿布祖。Far Jaati最古老的著作中提到他是Dyaus Pitra，而对于Akados的古人来说，他是Lir。",
	"Worship of The Father predated the formation of pantheons and culturally defined religions; in fact, the existence of The Father seems to predate the concept of worship or even the existence of humanoid life on Lloegyr.To these early cultures, The Father was known as patron of tribal warfare,competition for scarce resources, survival, dominance, and rulership by might, and he was seen as a primal creator of the world, life, and the gods themselves. The Father was typically not so much revered as feared, for the savage world was harsh and unforgiving with an equally harsh and unforgiving god for the strong to cling to and the weak to perish before. Ritual bloodshed marked the holy times and sites of The Father, and human sacrifice became a standard practice under his stern gaze.": "对天父的崇拜早于万神殿和文化定义的宗教的形成；事实上，天父的存在似乎早于崇拜的概念，甚至早于Lloegyr上人形生命的存在。对于这些早期文化，天父被称为部落战争、稀缺资源的竞争、生存、统治和强权统治的守护者，他被视为世界、生命和众神本身的原始创造者。父神通常不是被尊敬，而是被畏惧，因为野蛮的世界是残酷无情的，有一个同样残酷无情的神，强者可以依附，弱者可以灭亡。仪式上的流血事件标志着天父的神圣时间和地点，在他严厉的目光下，人的牺牲成为一种标准做法。",
	"Despite this near hegemony of devotion in the earliest ages of the world, worship for and even memory of The Father eventually died out, supplanted by belief in younger, gentler gods, many of whom are believed to be his children or even their offspring. Only in the most ancient records and esoteric circles is mention of The Father even found and usually then only disjointed and incomplete references. To those few with the depth of scholarship or requisite age (a few of the oldest elves and assorted dragons and undead beings) to even know of The Father, it is believed his eventual decline and erasure from the consciousness of humanity was in large part to the heroic and selfless actions of an equally primeval creator deity known only as The Goddess, mother of many of the oldest gods and both mate and mortal enemy of The Father. Thanks to her efforts, knowledge of The Father was forgotten from the world to the point that he is now considered a \"lost\" deity. None in this day and age revere The Father, nor is there liturgy available to revive his worship, except among a very few small and scattered tribal societies that exist as holdovers from those most ancient of times. Even in these cultures worship of The Father is corrupted and inexact due to lack of any written record, and such peoples themselves are in decline is well so that it is only a matter of time until The Father ceases to exist as a deific entity upon Lloegyr.": "尽管在世界最早的时代，人们对天父的崇拜甚至记忆几乎达到了霸权的程度，但最终还是消亡了，取而代之的是对更年轻、更温和的神的信仰，其中许多人被认为是天父的孩子甚至是他们的后代。只有在最古老的记录和神秘的圈子里才会提到天父，而且通常只是不连贯和不完整的提及。对于那些具有学术深度或必要年龄的少数人（少数最古老的精灵和各种龙和不死生物）来说，他们甚至知道天父，人们相信他最终的衰落和从人类的意识中抹去在很大程度上是由于一个同样原始的创世神的英勇和无私的行动，她只被称为女神，是许多最古老的神的母亲，同时也是天父的伴侣和死敌。由于她的努力，天父的知识被世界遗忘，以至于他现在被认为是一个 \"失落的 \"神灵。在这个时代，没有人崇敬天父，也没有可用来恢复对他的崇拜的礼仪，只有极少数小而分散的部落社会作为最古老时代的遗留物而存在。即使在这些文化中，由于缺乏任何书面记录，对天父的崇拜也是腐败的、不准确的，而且这些民族本身也在衰落，因此，天父在Lloegyr上不再作为一个神灵实体存在只是时间问题。",

Regardless, all rulers and leaders value his faith because his priests are known to possess a great many secrets and are willing to offer wise counsel to any ruler without regard to political or religious affiliation.": "Jamboor是Hyperborea的一个古老的神，从最早的时候就顽强地坚持着他的影响力。这个神秘的神灵被看作是一个良性或恶性的实体，取决于观众的立场。对一些人来说，死亡之神一定是邪恶的，因此，应该感到害怕，而对另一些人来说，他只是在生与死的循环中维持事物的正常秩序。而对其他人来说，他只是一个魔法和神秘知识的神，可以是仁慈的地方（%0%）或（%1%）的信仰。无论怎样，所有的统治者和领导人都重视他的信仰，因为他的祭司们都知道拥有大量的秘密，并愿意为任何统治者提供明智的建议，而不考虑政治或宗教的关系。",
	"Many local superstitions find their roots in the practices of the followers of Jamboor, and entire sects of his priesthood are tasked with sussing out the secrets of existence through listening to the whispers of the dead. The dates and times for the High Holy Days of the continent of Akados are determined and published each year by the priests of Jamboor and are recognized by those of all faiths. While the Wheels of Inquiry used by his followers to determine local omens and auguries can be found in almost any community for use by any who know the secrets of their interpretation.": "许多当地的迷信都源于詹波尔的追随者的做法，他的整个神职教派的任务是通过倾听死者的低语来探寻存在的秘密。阿卡多斯大陆的神圣节日的日期和时间每年都由詹博尔的祭司们决定并公布，并得到所有信仰者的认可。而他的追随者用来确定当地预兆和预言的调查轮，几乎在任何社区都可以找到，供任何知道其解释秘密的人使用。",
	"Despite his long and ongoing influence, Jamboor's age-old mastery of those who study the magical arts is now being challenged as the traveler deity {@deity Belon the Wise|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Belon the Wise} gains more and more followers among arcane practitioners. This situation has caused no small amount of consternation among the normally staid Jamboorites not only because of the encroachment upon their traditional sphere of influence but even more so because they did not foresee its coming.": "尽管詹伯尔长期以来一直具有影响力，但随着旅行者神灵（%0%）在魔法从业者中获得越来越多的追随者，詹伯尔对那些研究魔法艺术的人的古老掌控现在正受到挑战。这种情况在通常沉默寡言的詹博尔人中引起了不小的惊愕，这不仅是因为他们的传统势力范围受到了侵犯，更因为他们没有预见到它的到来。",
	"Kamien is the embodiment of springs, streams, and rivers, appearing as a woman with skin like silvery rippling water—earning her name as the Sparkling Maiden—or as a great silvery scaled fish—usually called Old Widemouth for resembling a massive bass. Bargemen and fishermen who ply her waterways toss coins into streams, fountains, and brooks to ensure safe passage and plentiful catches.": "卡米恩是泉水、溪流和河流的化身，她以女人的形象出现，皮肤像银色的水波纹，因此被称为闪闪发光的少女，或者以巨大的银色鳞片鱼的形象出现，通常被称为Old Widemouth，因为它类似于巨大的鲈鱼。在她的水道上航行的驳船夫和渔民向溪流、喷泉和小溪投掷硬币，以确保安全通行和丰厚的渔获。",
	"Kamien is one of the earliest Hyperborean deities, even predating that civilization, representing the springs and streams that provided plentiful water sources that allowed early humanoid settlements to be established and thrive. As such she became a community deity and was seen as protector of the town well, spring, or other water source required for their continued survival. As societies advanced and maintenance of water sources and the ability to find them became more sophisticated and reliable, her role as the protector of the community transformed somewhat into that of protector of travel and trade upon the waters of her streams and rivers. It is this aspect that is most frequently seen in her worship today, though settlements that greatly rely upon yearly flooding or preservation from such floods still revere her in the older incarnations through semi-annual flood festivals and the yearly Rising ceremony at midsummer to beseech her to keep the waters flowing throughout the dry season.": "卡米恩是最早的Hyperborean神灵之一，甚至早于该文明，代表了提供丰富水源的泉水和溪流，使早期的人形定居点得以建立和繁荣。因此，她成为一个社区的神灵，被视为城镇水井、泉水或其他持续生存所需的水源的保护者。随着社会的进步，对水源的维护和寻找水源的能力变得更加复杂和可靠，她作为社区保护者的角色在某种程度上转变为保护在她的溪流和河水上的旅行和贸易。今天，人们对她的崇拜中最常见的就是这一方面，尽管那些非常依赖每年的洪水或从这种洪水中保存下来的定居点仍然通过半年一次的洪水节和每年仲夏的升水仪式来敬仰她，以祈求她在整个旱季保持水的流动。",
	"Already considered an ancient deity among humans, Kamien's reach extends even farther back into the mists of time beyond even human civilization. In her earliest incarnation she is considered to be the mother of the nymphs and {@creature sprite|mm|sprites} and is a member of the Court of the Fey as a protector of fertility. Knowledge of this aspect is largely lost among human cultures today, though some prostitutes (usually in riverside communities) venerate the Sparkling Maiden for her seductive qualities, probably related to her relation to fey such as nymphs and {@creature nereid|tftyp|nereids} that are known for their beauty and allure. Her ancient background is further recalled vaguely in old wives' tales about the dangers of visiting the local spring or well at night because the Water Lady might come and steal the foolish visitor. That this could be a reference to Kamien and the sometimes predatory fey among her followers is a possibility, though it could just as easily be nothing more than a parental admonition to children to avoid drownings and other water accidents while unsupervised.": "卡米恩在人类中已经被认为是一个古老的神灵，她的影响力甚至延伸到人类文明以外的时间迷雾中。在她最早的化身中，她被认为是仙女和（%0%）的母亲，并且是作为生育力保护者的精灵法庭的成员。这方面的知识在今天的人类文化中基本消失了，尽管一些妓女（通常在河边社区）因其诱人的品质而崇敬闪光少女，这可能与她与仙女和（%1%）等以美丽和诱惑著称的精灵的关系有关。她的古老背景在老太太们的故事中被进一步模糊地回忆起来，说的是晚上去当地的泉水或水井的危险性，因为水姑娘可能会来偷走愚蠢的游客。这有可能是指卡米恩和她的追随者中有时具有掠夺性的精灵，不过这也很可能只是父母对孩子的告诫，避免在无人监管的情况下发生溺水和其他水事。",
	"The plucky and puckish God of Halflings, Mick O'Delving is the consummate prankster and ne'er-do-well. However, whereas the gnomish god Hammer Mittelschmerz represents the gnomes' propensity for elaborate jokes and tricks, Mick is much more about finding the advantage in any situation by hook or crook and making his way with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his eye, and always one eye on the authorities. His ability to get into trouble is surpassed only by his ability to get out again. He exemplifies the halflings' ability to survive under almost any circumstances while maintaining a certain humorous and affable outlook on life.": "半身人之神米克-奥德林（Mick O'Delving）是一个完美的恶作剧者和不务正业者。然而，地精之神哈默-米特施默兹（Hammer Mittelschmerz）代表了地精们对精心设计的笑话和把戏的倾向，而米克则更多地是在任何情况下不择手段地寻找优势，并在他的脸上挂着微笑，眼睛里闪烁着光芒，而且总是盯着当局的人。他陷入困境的能力只有在他再次摆脱困境的能力中才能得到体现。他体现了半身人在几乎任何情况下的生存能力，同时保持某种幽默和和蔼的生活态度。",
	"According to fables, Mick's first appearance occurred when some of the dwarven miners serving in the mines of the god Vergrimm Earthsblood complained to him about one miner who refused to wear his boots. Vergrimm descended into the depths to investigate where he found the unusually short, barefoot miner hammering away at a workface with his pickaxe while humming a jaunty tune, much to the annoyance of the dwarves laboring around him. When Vergrimm lifted the brim of his too-large helmet he met the eyes of the grimy-faced halfling good smiling merrily. Why Mick was laboring away in the dwarven mines is a question that the fables fail to answer beyond the fact that he thought it would be a grand joke upon the dwarves. Regardless, his propensity for delving and interminable sense of humor served as a perfect counterpoint to the dour dwarven god such that the two became fast friends and known drinking companions. The fact that Pekko often attends their late-night drinking bouts only adds to the legendarium of Mick and is probably the source of his nickname in many a drunken toast as Mickey Two-Cups, for the ale jack that he holds in each hand. His peculiar origins cause many dwarves to refer to him as the Little Miner, an appellation to which halflings usually take umbrage, though if it bothers Mick himself he has never said so.": "根据寓言故事，米克的第一次出现是在一些矮人矿工在韦格林土血神的矿场工作时，向他抱怨一个拒绝穿靴子的矿工。维尔格林下到深处调查，发现这个异常矮小的赤脚矿工一边用镐头敲打着工作面，一边哼着欢快的小调，让周围劳动的矮人很是恼火。当维尔格林掀开他那太大的头盔的帽檐时，他看到了那个面目狰狞的半身人的眼睛，很高兴地笑了。米克为什么要在矮人的矿场里劳动，这个问题寓言中没有回答，只说他认为这是对矮人的一个大玩笑。不管怎么说，他的钻研倾向和无休止的幽默感是对矮人之神的完美反击，以至于两人很快成为朋友和著名的酒伴。佩克经常参加他们的深夜饮酒活动，这一事实只会增加米克的传奇色彩，也可能是他在许多醉酒的祝酒词中被称为 \"米奇双杯 \"的来源，因为他两只手都拿着麦芽酒插孔。他奇特的出身使许多矮人称他为小矿工，半身人通常对这一称谓感到不满，不过如果这让米克本人感到不安，他也从未说过。",
	"Despite his merry, even happy-go-lucky reputation, all of the mythology of Mick is not so jolly. The god's first wife was the goddess Sotheryn, known as Lady Suzanne among the halflings. A goddess of community, fertility, and the life-death cycle, there's was a marriage of balance and happiness with her calming, quiet demeanor serving to offset and soothe his over-enthusiastic, almost manic nature. Yet eternal happiness was not to be even among the gods, for one of Mick O'Delving's many pranks mortally offended the Queen of Spiders, vindictive goddess of the drow, and she plotted to murder him. Lady Suzanne managed to learn of the plot at the last second and drank the poison intended for him, saving him but at the cost of her own life. Perhaps the most famous composition by any halfling bard is the Lay of Sotheryn, penned in honor of the Lady Suzanne.": "尽管他有快乐的，甚至是幸福的名声，但米克的所有神话都不是那么快乐。这位神的第一任妻子是女神索瑟林，在半身人中被称为苏珊娜女士。作为社区、生育和生死轮回的女神，她平静、安静的举止抵消并抚慰了他过度热情、近乎狂躁的天性，这是一场平衡和幸福的婚姻。然而，即使在众神之间也不可能有永恒的幸福，因为米克-奥德文的许多恶作剧之一致命地触怒了蜘蛛女王，她是报复性的乌鸦女神，她策划了谋杀他。苏珊娜女士在最后一秒设法得知了这个阴谋，并喝下了为他准备的毒药，救了他，但却牺牲了自己的生命。也许半身人吟游诗人最著名的作品是《索瑟林之歌》，是为纪念苏珊娜女士而写的。",
	"This incident is also what has spawned own of the most peculiar organizations in the history of halflings, a secret society of halfling assassins known as the Barefeet. These folk lead seemingly normal halfling lives as farmers, brewers, bakers, or any other mundane and otherwise humble trade typically found among halflings, but all the way they wage a clandestine war against the drow and the clergy of the Queen of Spiders in particular. Spying, gathering information, and training in secret, these seemingly ordinary folk carefully plan and orchestrate deadly attacks against their hated foes at opportune moments. The local tailor might close up his shop one day to \"go visit his cousin in the next town over.\" Meanwhile in the next town over a halfling barber closes up shop to \"attend his aunt's funeral in the city,\" with the pattern repeating itself again and again across multiple communities. Then a week or so later, they return to reopen shops and resume business and life as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, while in some other location not far away a drow caravan or delegation of drow clerics is found completely slaughtered by unknown assailants.": "这一事件也催生了半身人历史上最奇特的组织，一个由半身人刺客组成的秘密社团，称为 \"赤脚\"。这些人过着看似正常的半身人生活，如农民、酿酒师、面包师，或任何其他通常在半身人中发现的世俗和其他卑微的行业，但他们一直在对鸦人，特别是蜘蛛女王的神职人员发动秘密战争。这些看似平凡的人在秘密地收集信息和进行训练，在适当的时候精心策划和安排对他们仇恨的敌人的致命攻击。当地的裁缝可能在某一天关闭他的商店，\"去拜访他在隔壁镇的表弟\"。同时，在下一个城镇，一个半身人理发师关了店门，\"去城里参加他姨妈的葬礼\"，这种模式在多个社区不断重复。然后一个星期左右，他们回来重新开店，恢复生意和生活，就像没有发生过任何异常一样，而在不远处的其他地方，一个乌鸦商队或乌鸦神职人员代表团被发现被未知的袭击者完全屠杀了。",
	"After the death of his first wife, Mick O'Delving later married the halfling goddess Hester, Handmaiden of {@deity Ceres|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Ceres} and Mother of the Hearthfire.Theirs is a relationship less ideal than that of his first marriage, with the calm and dignified Hester providing counterpoint to Mick's often wild ways, but lacking the serenity enjoyed by her predecessor. Legends speak of the arguments that have occurred in the household of Mick O'Delving, and halfling children say that the thunder is another pot or pan flung by Hester at her wayward husband. Despite these high-spirited bouts their love is genuine, though some quiet whispers speak of Hester finding love with a mortal halfling causing clerics of both faiths to offer up prayers seeking shelter from any coming turmoil.": "第一任妻子去世后，米克-欧德文后来娶了半身人女神海丝特，她是{@deity Ceres|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Ceres}的女仆和炉火之母。他们的关系没有他第一段婚姻那么理想，平静而庄重的海丝特为米克经常的狂野行为提供了反驳，但缺乏她的前任所享有的宁静。传说中，米克-奥德文的家里发生过争吵，半身人的孩子们说，雷声是海丝特向她任性的丈夫甩出的另一个锅或碟。尽管有这些激烈的争吵，但他们的爱是真诚的，尽管有些悄悄话说海丝特找到了与凡人半身人的爱情，导致两种信仰的神职人员提供祈祷，以寻求对任何即将到来的动荡的庇护。",
	"Mitra has become one of the most commonly worshipped gods in Akados, despite being a transplant from eastern lands. Part of Mitra's appeal is his emphasis on humility among his worshippers while at the same time championing justice and rule of law. Thus while the powers-that-be worship Mitra to uphold their rightful rule and the laws of the land, he is appealing to the common folk for his insistence on the principles of mercy and fairness among the high and low alike. Another god that probably found its way into Akados through the crusading knights of the Foerdewaith, Mitra's true rise to prominence in the West undoubtedly stems from a single incident some 700 years ago when he allegedly appeared to the Foerdewaith overking, Osbert II, before the pivotal battle of Oescreheit Downs promising victory for the beleaguered Foerdewaith against the vastly superior numbers of the Heldring horde. When the Heldring were defeated and their threat finally broken once and for all, many took Mitra's appearance to mean that he favored the rightful rule of the Foerdewaith overkings and adopted him as the patron of Macobert's dynasty.": "米特拉已经成为阿卡多斯最普遍崇拜的神之一，尽管他是从东方国家移植过来的。米特拉的部分吸引力在于他强调崇拜者的谦逊，同时又拥护正义和法治。因此，虽然当权者崇拜米特拉是为了维护他们的合法统治和国家的法律，但他对普通民众的吸引力在于他坚持仁慈和公平的原则，在高低贵贱之间都是如此。另一位可能是通过Foerdewaith的十字军骑士进入阿卡多斯的神，米特拉在西方的真正崛起无疑是源于大约700年前的一次事件，据称他在Oescreheit Downs的关键战役前出现在Foerdewaith的国王Osbert II面前，承诺为陷入困境的Foerdewaith战胜数量庞大的Heldring部落。当海德林人被打败，他们的威胁最终被彻底打破时，许多人认为米特拉的出现意味着他赞成Foerdewaith国王的合法统治，并将他作为Macobert王朝的守护者。",
	"The shift as a result of this changing attitude was gradual and took place only in small incremental steps, but its progress has been inexorable.The adoption of Mitra as a specifically Macobertian sponsor largely pushed the traditional recognition of Quell in that role to the side until recent centuries when the most devout loyalty to the Sea King has largely shifted to the maritime Empire of Oceanus. Other gods that have felt the greatest decline as a result of Mitra's rise are the sun goddess {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus} (to such an extent that many folk of Akados have begun to refer to the sun as Mitra in the Eastern fashion rather than as Sol or {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus} as has been traditionally done in the West), {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir} as a Lawful war goddess,and {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} in his role of Lawgiver and god of justice. At point in time, virtually every judge and court in Akados looked to {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} as its patron, but now Mitra predominates in that role by a narrow margin, and his influence in the areas of the sun and healing ensures that his adherents' growth continues even as {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr's} declines.": "作为这种态度变化的结果，转变是渐进的，只在小范围内发生，但其进展是不可阻挡的。采用米特拉作为专门的马库伯斯赞助者，在很大程度上把对奎尔的传统认可推到了一边，直到最近几个世纪，对海王最虔诚的忠诚基本上转移到了海洋帝国的奥克西斯。由于米特拉的崛起，其他感受到最大衰落的神是太阳女神（%0%）（以至于阿卡多斯的许多民众开始按照东方的方式将太阳称为米特拉，而不是像西方传统的那样称为索尔或（%1%）），（%2%）作为合法的战争女神，以及（%3%）作为法律赋予者和正义之神。在过去，几乎所有阿卡多斯的法官和法庭都把{@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}作为其守护神，但现在米特拉以微弱的优势在这个角色中占主导地位，他在太阳和治疗领域的影响力确保他的信徒继续增长，即使{@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr's}在下降。",
	"Muir is the twin sister of {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} and one of the fabled Three Gods of old. While he represents law and peace, she represents the martial valor necessary to make that peace a reality. As such, she is the goddess of paladins and the principle martial deity of the Heldring. She is often depicted as a dark-tressed maiden warrior in shining mail with an upraised (often bloodstained) sword. She is noble and single-minded of purpose. The tenets of her worship include honor, truth, and courage. A great order of Hyperborean paladins known as the Justicars were sworn to her service but are believed to have died off at the time of the Battle of Tsar and the fall of Tircople some three centuries ago. She and {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} serve as the combined state religion of the Empire of Alcaldar in Libynos and is seen as the matron of the martial Church Militans of its Holy Ecclesia Inquisitorial. The knights of the Church Militans see themselves as the modern incarnation of the Holy Order of Justicars, though followers of Muir outside Alcaldar do not support this claim.": "穆尔是{@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}的孪生姐妹，也是传说中的古老三神之一。他代表法律与和平，而她则代表使和平成为现实所需的武勇。因此，她是圣骑士的女神，也是Heldring的主要武神。她经常被描绘成一个身穿闪亮盔甲的黑发少女战士，手持高举的（通常是血迹斑斑的）剑。她崇高而又一心一意。她崇拜的信条包括荣誉、真理和勇气。一个被称为 \"Justicars \"的伟大的Hyperborean圣骑士团曾宣誓为她服务，但据信在大约三个世纪前的沙皇之战和提尔科普尔陷落时已经消亡。她和(1%)作为利比诺斯的阿尔卡达尔帝国的联合国教，被视为其神圣教会民兵的主教。教会Militans的骑士们认为自己是神圣的Justicars骑士团的现代化身，尽管Alcaldar以外的Muir的追随者并不支持这种说法。",
	"Like her brother-deity {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}, Muir has lost some of the predominance that she once enjoyed in Akados and throughout the Hyperborean Empire. Her High Altar was moved to the vicinity of Bard's Gate after the fall of Tircople and has since fallen into decline there as well. However, like {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} she has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity among the now-devout Heldring of the Helcynngae Peninsula, where she is known as Eostre, and within the Empire of Alcaldar in Libynos. Both the Heldring hledwalda and the Alcaldrich empress press for relocation of the High Altar of Muir to their respective domains, but the goddess has yet to make a pronouncement on the matter so for now it remains in its diminished state in the city of Bard's Gate.": "就像她的兄弟神祗（%0%）一样，穆尔已经失去了一些她曾经在阿卡多斯和整个超波利斯帝国享有的优势地位。她的大祭坛在提尔索普尔陷落后被移到了巴德门附近，此后也在那里衰落了。然而，就像(1%)一样，她在Helcynngae半岛现在虔诚的Heldring中享受到了复苏的人气，在那里她被称为Eostre，在Libynos的Alcaldar帝国中也是如此。海德林的赫德瓦尔达和阿尔卡尔德的女皇都要求将穆尔高坛迁往他们各自的领地，但女神还没有对此事做出声明，所以现在它仍然保持在巴德之门城市中的衰弱状态。",
	"Muir expects self-sacrifice, humility, and charity as well as unswerving loyalty, and her worshipers must be lawful good. Her standards are extreme and she quickly turns her back on any who fail to live up to them. Those who maintain her standards, however, may strive to become Justicars, an order of paladins imbued with even greater holiness if the means to reviving that order can be discovered somewhere in the ruins of lost Tircople.": "穆尔期望自我牺牲、谦逊和慈善，以及坚定不移的忠诚，她的崇拜者必须是合法的好人。她的标准是极端的，她很快就会拒绝任何达不到标准的人。然而，那些保持她的标准的人可以努力成为正义之士，一个被赋予了更大的神圣性的圣骑士团，如果能在失落的提尔科普尔废墟的某个地方发现恢复该团的方法。",

	"Solanus is the benevolent goddess of the sun, Sol as it has traditionally been named in Akados. She is a goddess of ancient Hyperborea who, as a founding deity of that culture, has known great popularity in Akados across the breadth of the empire. Her priests have often served as field medics in armies and once comprised an entire Legion of ancient Hyperborea. They have also commonly been the local healers in villages and small towns. Some hospitals were established in Solanus's name in certain imperial centers (namely Remenos and Curgantium), but the practice never caught on in more remote settings where sufficient funds from the imperial coffers were frequently unavailable. As a result, her rural clergyremained principally scattered as individual practitioners while her central high church maintained a rigid hierarchy that often looked with disdain upon the rural church as disorganized or even bumpkins. Perhaps the church's greatest claim to notoriety over the centuries, however, has been the propensity for members of her rural clergy to join adventuring bands. At one time in the empire's history, it is likely that as many as 8 out of 10 adventuring parties, mercenary companies, or freelance knights was accompanied by a cleric of Solanus, bringing great acceptance and goodwill among the common folk far beyond what could have been managed by the central offices of the church tucked away in the great cities of the empire. Many of the older bardic hero tales composed in the classical style of those times include a warrior of {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}, a wizard of {@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor}, a paladin of {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir}, and a cleric of Solanus as heroic archetypes.

In general her worship becomes more common the farther west one travels across Akados, as the faith of {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} has not yet spread that far.

Rewarded for years of faithful service, and his steadfast guardianship of the Black Monolith from the forces of evil marshaling against him, {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}, the God of Law and Justice, elevated him to sainthood. Now an even more tireless foe of Evil, St Abysthor is the patron of those who guard or seek to close portals to the Lower Planes.": "阿比斯托尔是神界的新成员，最近在一些坚强的冒险家的帮助下刚刚升天。为了奖励他多年来的忠诚服务，以及他对黑色巨石的坚定守护，使其免受邪恶势力的攻击，法律和正义之神（%0%）将他提升为圣人。现在，圣阿比斯托尔是一个更加不知疲倦的邪恶敌人，他是那些守护或寻求关闭通往下层世界的门户的人的守护神。",
	"St. Abysthor has a particular enmity for worshippers of {@deity Orcus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Orcus} and {@deity Tsathogga|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Tsathogga}, as he kept those forces at bay for many years, blocking their access to a particularly weak gate to the Abyss. Had St. Abysthor failed in his guardianship, the entire world may well have been overrun by demonic forces.": "圣-阿比斯托尔对{@deity Orcus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Orcus}和{@deity Tsathogga|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Tsathogga}的崇拜者有着特殊的敌意，因为他多年来一直遏制着这些力量，阻止他们进入一个特别薄弱的深渊大门。如果圣-阿比斯托尔在他的守护中失败了，整个世界很可能已经被恶魔的力量所占领了。",
	"St. Abysthor is currently only active in the Stoneheart Valley region, and may render some form of assistance to worshippers of {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} or {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir}, should they beseech him for aid, especially against the forces of {@deity Orcus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Orcus} or {@deity Tsathogga|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Tsathogga}.": "圣-阿比斯托尔目前只在石心谷地区活动，如果（%0%）或（%1%）的崇拜者向他求援，他可能会提供某种形式的帮助，尤其是在对抗（%2%）或（%3%）的势力时。",
	"This Hyperborean god is the embodiment of the uncaring changing seasons. He is prayed to not so much to bring good crops, but to be convinced to hold off the early frost or bring the spring thaw. He requires appeasement and devoted following, being known to test his followers faithfulness and resolve when it suits him. {@deity Telophus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Telophus} and {@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya} are natural antagonists to each other between his uncaring detachment and her personal interest in the well-being of her faithful. This translates into occasional confrontations and difficulties between the moribund priesthood of the Lord of Crops and Seasons and the fiery devotees of {@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya}. ": "这位海波雷神是无情的季节变化的化身。人们对他的祈祷不是为了带来丰收，而是为了说服他挡住早霜或带来春天的解冻。他需要安抚和虔诚的追随，众所周知，在适合他的时候，他会测试追随者的忠诚度和决心。{@deity Telophus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Telophus}和{@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya}在他的无情疏离和她对其信徒的福祉的个人利益之间是天然的对立面。这转化为庄稼和季节之主的奄奄一息的神职与{@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya}的火热信徒之间偶尔的对抗和困难。",
	"Telophus has long been credited with bringing the orderly advance of the seasons for planting, growing, reaping, and storing. Farmers almost universally propitiate this god, though interestingly, as a primarily neutral diety; the bounty of this process is often accredited to {@deity Ceres|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Ceres} or {@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya}, whereas Telophus seems simply to be more concerned that the natural processes continue as they should. The lawful aspect of his nature reflects this adherence to the strict natural cycles of day and night, sun and storm, and the endless revolution of the seasons. One result of this detached view of the process is that some strange druidic cults of Telophus have emerged over the centuries that take a distinctly anti-civilization view. Whether this more-malicious interpretation of his faith is bothersome to the deity is unclear, as he has never commented to his priesthood on it in one way or the other.": "长期以来，泰洛弗斯一直被认为是为播种、生长、收割和储存带来了季节的有序推进。农民们几乎普遍向这位神明表示敬意，但有趣的是，他主要是作为一个中立的神明；这一过程的赏赐往往被认可为（%0%）或（%1%），而泰洛弗斯似乎只是更关注自然过程的持续，因为他们应该。他本性中合法的一面反映了他对白天和黑夜、太阳和风暴以及四季无休止的革命等严格的自然周期的坚持。这种对过程的超然看法的一个结果是，几个世纪以来出现了一些奇怪的德鲁伊教派对泰洛弗斯的崇拜，采取明显的反文明观点。他对自己信仰的这种更恶毒的解释是否让神灵感到困扰还不清楚，因为他从来没有以这种或那种方式向他的神职人员发表过意见。",
	"Thyr is the god of wise and just rule. He is normally depicted as a wizened king seated on a great throne, holding the Rod of Kingship in one hand and the Chalice of Peace in the other. His principles are justice, order and peace. He represents proper and traditional rule and as such was once worshiped (at least in name) by all human royalty. He is the embodiment of the enlightened human caste system where each person has a fairly determined role in a lawful society intended to create the greatest good for the greatest number.": "蒂尔是明智和公正的统治之神。他通常被描绘成一个坐在大宝座上的枯瘦的国王，一手拿着王权之杖，一手拿着和平之杯。他的原则是正义、秩序与和平。他代表着正确和传统的统治，因此曾经受到所有人类皇室成员的崇拜（至少在名义上）。他是开明的人类种姓制度的化身，在这个合法的社会中，每个人都有一个相当确定的角色，旨在为最大多数人创造最大的利益。",
	"Thyr's symbol is a silver cross on a white field, symbolizing the upturned cross-haft of his sister's sword, which he thrust into the earth to end the Gods' War at the dawn of time. Upon seeing the blood of so many gods shed, Thyr foreswore the use of swords and his priests, for this reason, may not use bladed weapons. Many favor reinforced rods, similar to light maces, modeled after Thyr's own Rod of Kingship. The noble eagle and lion are his sacred creatures.": "蒂尔的标志是白色场地上的一个银色十字架，象征着他妹妹的剑的上翘的十字轴，他在黎明时分将剑插入大地以结束诸神之战。看到这么多神的鲜血流淌，蒂尔发誓不再使用剑，因此他的祭司们不得使用带刃的武器。许多人喜欢强化的棒子，类似于轻巧的马刀，仿照蒂尔自己的王权之棒。高贵的鹰和狮子是他的圣物。",
	"The Lawgiver, Thyr is a god that has transcended culture and appears in different aspects among different groups on the world of Lloegyr, spanning cultures from the Northlands to the Helcynngae Peninsula in the south. To Northlanders (and the Andøvan before them) he is known as Tiwaz and is depicted as having only one hand, the other having been bitten off by a powerful Godspawn of Chaos while Tiwaz distracted it and allowed it to be bound for the good of the world.": "法律制定者，Thyr是一个超越文化的神，在Lloegyr世界的不同群体中以不同的面貌出现，跨越了从北地到南部的Helcynngae半岛的文化。对于北地人（以及之前的安多瓦人）来说，他被称为蒂瓦兹，被描述为只有一只手，另一只手被一个强大的混沌神卒咬掉，而蒂瓦兹分散了它的注意力，让它为了世界的利益而被束缚。",
	"Thyr has actually been a part of the Hyperborean pantheon for thousands of years and for much of that empire's history was considered among its chief gods and most influential in its civilization alongside {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir} and Arden (and later {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus}). Thyr is also one of the ancient trinity of deities known as the Three Gods that predates the Hyperboreans. The Heldring venerate him as Tyr in much the same aspect as Thyr, though they depict him as one handed like Tiwaz.": "几千年来，Thyr实际上一直是Hyperborean万神殿的一部分，在该帝国的大部分历史中，Thyr被认为是其主要神灵之一，在其文明中最具影响力，与（%0%）和Arden（以及后来的（%1%））并列。Thyr也是古代三位一体的神灵之一，被称为三神，比Hyperboreans更早。海德林人将他尊称为泰尔，与蒂尔基本相同，不过他们将他描绘成像蒂瓦兹那样的单手。",
	"It is unknown whether Thyr is truly a Northlands transplant or if his worship in fact developed concurrently but separately in the two different cultures. Or for that matter if it didn't develop long prior to either of them existing only to diverge somewhere along the way. In fact, it is not entirely certain that he is truly aspects of the same god (though the belief of that is near universal). Regardless, Thyr does not seem to raise any objection to the correlation, and his Thyr identity has by far been his largest church historically. The modern Heldring have formed an almost-theocratic society devoted to Tyr and Eostre (their name for Muir), and their hledwalda petitions annually for the High Altar of Thyr to be moved from Bard's Gate to Kingsgardt in the Kingdom of the Helcynn, while the empress of the actual-theocracy of Alcaldar likewise presses for it to be established in the imperial capital of Mhaltra. To date Thyr's clergy have remained silent on the subject of relocation, though patience wears thin among the royalties of those respective nations.": "我们不知道Thyr是否真的是北地的移植者，或者他的崇拜实际上是在两种不同的文化中同时发展但分开的。或者说，在这两种文化存在之前，他的崇拜是不是早就发展起来了，只是在某个地方发生了分歧。事实上，并不完全确定他是同一个神的真正方面（尽管这种信念几乎是普遍的）。不管怎么说，蒂尔似乎没有对这种关联性提出任何异议，而且他的蒂尔身份到目前为止一直是他在历史上最大的教会。现代海德林人已经形成了一个几乎是神权的社会，致力于Tyr和Eostre（他们对Muir的称呼），他们的hledwalda每年都会请求将Thyr的高级祭坛从Bard's Gate搬到Helcynn王国的Kingsgardt，而Alcaldar的实际神权的女皇也同样要求将其建立在帝国首都Mhaltra。迄今为止，Thyr的神职人员对搬迁的问题保持沉默，尽管这些国家的皇室成员的耐心已经消磨殆尽。",
	"Despite his millennia of success and the establishment of no less than two current monarchies largely based on his faith, Thyr has seen a near-continuous decline across the breadth of old Hyperborean lands, especially since the rise of the Eastern god {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra}. However, his high priest notes that this decline cannot be fully laid at the feet of the upstart Mitra, because it actually precedes his dramatic appearance to Overking Osbert II seven centuries ago. Rather, High Priest Bofred of Bard's Gate points out that the first hints of the decline had occurred even before the end of the Hyperborean Empire, much less the current decline of the Foerdewaith in recent centuries, pointing to a subtle but pervasive omnipresent diminishment in civilization over this time period. A diminishment that Bofred and others fear may be a harbinger of worse things to come.": "尽管他几千年来取得了成功，并且建立了不少于两个主要基于他的信仰的现存君主国，但Thyr在古老的Hyperborean土地上几乎持续衰退，特别是自从东方神（%0%）的崛起。然而，他的大祭司指出，这种衰落不能完全归咎于后起之秀米特拉的脚下，因为它实际上在七个世纪前他戏剧性地出现在国王奥斯伯特二世面前之前。相反，巴德之门的大祭司博弗雷德指出，甚至在海伯利安帝国结束之前就已经出现了衰落的最初迹象，更不用说近几个世纪以来Foerdewaith的衰落了，这表明在这段时间里，文明有一个微妙但普遍存在的减弱现象。Bofred和其他人担心，这种减少可能是未来更糟糕事情的预兆。",
	"Yenomesh is the aged sage of the gods. He is said to have been the first to gain knowledge of the sacred runes of the Language Eternal which he taught to the gods and elevated them from the Original Chaos. Likewise it was he who created the written characters of the language known as Foundation, allowing the concepts of the Language Eternal to be grasped by mortal minds and brought the light of knowledge to the world. He is likewise credited with being the inventor of all written language since it is derived from the characters of Foundation, and his priests are often fluent in writing and speaking many different tongues. For his role in imparting knowledge upon the mortal races, libraries and archives are often dedicated to Yenomesh, and many have at least one small shrine in his honor.": "耶诺美是众神的年长贤者。据说他是第一个获得 \"永恒之语 \"神圣符文知识的人，他将其传授给众神，并将他们从原始混沌中提升出来。同样，也是他创造了被称为 \"基础 \"的语言文字，让凡人的头脑掌握了 \"永恒语言 \"的概念，并将知识之光带到了世界。他同样被认为是所有书面语言的发明者，因为它来自于基金会的字符，他的祭司往往能流利地书写和说许多不同的语言。由于他在向凡人种族传授知识方面的作用，图书馆和档案馆经常被献给耶诺美，许多人至少有一个小神龛以纪念他。",
	"Despite the universality of Yenomesh's contributions to the world in the form of writing, he was not always considered to be a part of the Hyperborean pantheon. Originally Yenomesh was found only in the ancient religions of the East. It was during the Hyperborean expansion into Libynos some three-and-a-half thousand years ago that the West encountered the monastics of Yenomesh. They later recognized the value and contributions of the Yenomeshi faith when Hyperborean scholarship realized that all known languages were derived from a script that the monastics used to write their own scrolls. As scholars practiced in the arcane arts discovered that this Foundation language also served as the basis for magical writings, western wizards began to show interest in the faith as well. Yenomesh has never had sufficient popularity among magical practitioners that it threatened the faith of {@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor} or later {@deity Belon the Wise|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Belon the Wise}, but he has also had a small and devoted following of these spellcasters who delve deeply into the mysteries of alternate forms of magical writing.": "尽管耶诺美以文字的形式对世界做出了普遍的贡献，但他并不总是被认为是超波利尼西亚万神殿的一部分。最初，Yenomesh只在东方的古老宗教中被发现。大约在三千五百年前，在超波利人向利比诺斯扩张的过程中，西方人遇到了耶诺玛斯的僧侣。后来，当超波利人的学术研究意识到所有已知的语言都来自于修士们用来书写他们自己的卷轴的文字时，他们认识到了耶诺美希信仰的价值和贡献。当精通奥术的学者们发现这种基础语言也是魔法著作的基础时，西方的巫师们也开始对这个信仰表现出兴趣。耶诺墨在魔法修行者中从未有足够的知名度，以至于威胁到{@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor}或后来的{@deity Belon the Wise|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Belon the Wise}的信仰，但他也有一小部分忠实的追随者，这些施法者深入研究另一种形式的魔法书写的奥秘。",
	"This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with slow, oozing sickness and decay. He is the vicious dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Making his home on the plane of Tarterus at the mouth of the vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows out of the Abyss, Tsathogga's main form is a colossally bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs andfingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul humors and fluids that leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He never moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking. Tsathogga commands a host of evil creatures—notably evil aberrations and his own vile frog race, the tsathar. Thousands of fawning tsathar servants continuously bathe his body in fetid slime from the evil swamp, awaiting the divine bliss of being randomly devoured by him. His hatred of light and lack of human worshippers (though there are a few notable exceptions) mean that he is little known to surface races. He has had few organized centers of worship and no standardized holy symbol—each worshipper choosing its own way to best depict his deific vileness. Occasionally, tsathar priests of Tsathogga on Tarterus sculpt a small likeness of him out of foul chunks of solid waste from the Styx that harden into a vile green substance similar to soapstone when taken from that plane. Such items are prized as holy relics.": "这个肮脏的青蛙恶魔不关心人和权力的阴谋，而是用缓慢的、渗出的疾病和腐烂来抹杀光明和生命。他是从地表下涌出的邪恶的黑暗力量，是地球中心的肮脏的腐败。他的家在Tarterus平面上，位于冥河流出深渊时沉积的巨大污秽沼泽口，Tsathogga的主要形态是一只巨大的臃肿的人形青蛙，有着细长的肢体和手指。他肥胖的身体散发着各种恶臭和液体，渗入他所在的卑鄙沼泽地。他把自己的位置安排得很好，使冥河的所有粘液和污物都能进入他那张牙舞爪的嘴里。他从不移动，除了发出难以理解的尖叫声外，很少说话。沙托加指挥着一大批邪恶的生物--特别是邪恶的反常者和他自己卑鄙的青蛙种族，沙塔尔。数以千计献媚的tsathar仆人不断地用来自邪恶沼泽的腥臭粘液沐浴他的身体，等待着被他随机吞噬的神圣幸福。他对光明的憎恨和缺乏人类的崇拜者（尽管有几个明显的例外）意味着他对地表种族鲜为人知。他很少有有组织的崇拜中心，也没有标准化的神圣符号--每个崇拜者都选择自己的方式来最好地描绘他的神性的邪恶。偶尔，Tarterus上Tsathogga的祭司会用来自冥河的固体废物的臭块雕刻出他的小像，这些固体废物从冥河中取出后会硬化成一种类似肥皂石的卑鄙的绿色物质。这样的物品被当作圣物来珍视。"
