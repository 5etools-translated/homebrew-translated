	"These involuntary tremors can have many causes, but are most often brought about when a creature goes a long period without drinking alcohol.": "这些不由自主的颤抖可能有许多原因，但最常见的是当一个生物长期不饮酒时带来的。",
	"Symptoms manifest around an hour after the last time the afflicted creature had a drink. The onset of the symptoms is usually accompanied by escalating complaints from the individual, starting with a relatively harmless \"gosh, I'm parched. Anyone else fancy a drink?\" and moving swiftly through \"do you know any pubs around here? I don't mind if it's a bit of a dive\" to \"I swear to Moradin I'd kill for a stein right now. Hey, what're you hiding there?\" During this process, the creature will have trouble concentrating on anything, and their hands will be visibly shaking.": "症状表现在受影响的生物最后一次喝酒后一小时左右。症状的出现通常伴随着个人不断升级的抱怨，从相对无害的 \"天哪，我渴了。还有人想喝酒吗？\"然后迅速发展到 \"你知道这附近有什么酒吧吗？我不介意它有点像潜水艇 \"到 \"我向莫拉丁发誓，我现在就想喝杯酒。嘿，你在那里藏着什么？\" 在这个过程中，这个生物将很难集中精力做任何事情，他们的手会明显地颤抖。",
	"Thereafter, for every hour during which the afflicted creature fails to find and consume an alcoholic beverage, they suffer a cumulative -2 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks, to a maximum of -10. Additionally, suffer the effects of the {@condition poisoned} condition. Should the afflicted creature consume alcohol, the symptoms clear within minutes, and are suppressed for the next hour. Should the creature fail to consume alcohol, the symptoms instead worsen. At around 24 hours from the last time the creature had a drink, they begin to experience intense withdrawal, and gain three levels of exhaustion.": "此后，在受影响的生物未能找到并饮用酒精饮料的每一个小时，他们的智慧（感知）检查都会受到累计的-2惩罚，最高为-10。此外，受到（%0%）条件的影响。如果受影响的生物饮用了酒精，症状会在几分钟内消失，并在接下来的一小时内被抑制。如果该生物未能饮酒，症状反而会恶化。在距离该生物最后一次饮酒约24小时后，他们开始经历强烈的戒断，并获得三级的疲惫。",
	"Should the creature wish to cure themselves of this disease, they need only refrain from consuming alcohol for {@dice 1d4+2} days. ": "如果生物希望治愈这种疾病，他们只需要在{@dice 1d4+2}天内不饮酒。"
