Their own lives are often second to an investigation, meaning many of them are quite reckless and meet some ill-fated end. However, that is not to say all sleuths follow their noses without a brain. Sleuths are best known for their deductive thinking capabilities and questioning faculties, which is what keeps the wheels turning and the plot thickening. Mysteries are their daily bread and butter.": "在制作这种背景的人物时，要牢记关键特征：好奇心。侦探很少有良好的隐私意识。他们会窥探和打探事情的真相，就像鲨鱼对血一样。他们自己的生命往往是调查的第二位，这意味着他们中的许多人相当鲁莽，会遇到一些命运多舛的结局。然而，这并不是说所有的侦探都是跟着鼻子走，没有脑子。侦探最有名的是他们的推理思维能力和提问能力，这也是让车轮不断转动、情节不断深入的原因。奥秘是他们的日常面包和黄油。",
	"When making a sleuth character, ask yourself these questions: What prompted your character down this path of investigation? Justice? Pure curiosity? What was the biggest discovery your character ever made in their career? Or is this just some side hobby to amuse their boredom? Do you dive straight into a good story, or do you like to take a step back and wait for more clues to appear? Do you even care if you're peeping in a bath or snooping in someone else's house? ": "在塑造一个侦探角色时，要问自己这些问题。是什么促使你的角色走上这条调查之路？正义？纯粹的好奇心？你的角色在职业生涯中的最大发现是什么？或者这只是他们消遣无聊的一些副业？你是直接潜入一个好的故事，还是喜欢退一步，等待更多的线索出现？你甚至关心你是在偷看别人洗澡还是在窥探别人的房子？"
