	"You embed the soul and personality of a willing target into an item. While affected by this spell, the target doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age or die. It retains its senses. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.": "你将一个自愿的目标的灵魂和个性嵌入到一个物品中。在受此法术影响时，目标不需要呼吸、吃或喝，也不会衰老或死亡。它保留了它的感官。占卜法术无法定位或感知目标。",
	"The target's perception of the vessel may vary and is chosen by the caster as they form a mental image of the target's place of voluntary imprisonment. The target will be able to verbally communicate with creatures outside of the vessel, and to communicate telepathically with creatures attuned to the item. While within the vessel, the target may summon any mundane items they desire.": "目标对容器的感知可能会有所不同，由施法者选择，因为他们对目标自愿被囚禁的地方形成了心理阴影。目标将能够与容器外的生物进行口头交流，并与与该物品相适应的生物进行心灵感应。在容器内，目标可以召唤他们想要的任何世俗物品。",
	"The item used as a vessel gains a magical aura about it and is inured to wear and damage. It also has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and resistant to damage originating from such.

Your duplicate has all of the same abilities (though none of your equipment), spells and features that you do, but these become shared resources between you both. If your duplicate casts a spell, you both lose the corresponding spell slot, for example. Your duplicate ages at the same rate as you do and is immune to the {@spell dispel magic} spell.

	"A creature entering the pool for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 4d6} acid damage on a failed save and sinking into the pool, as the grappled condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much acid damage and is not grappled. A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A creature of size Large or smaller that fails the saving throw while already grappled by the pool is also restrained against your spell save DC.": "第一次进入池子的生物或开始在池子里的生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，如果蓄力失败，会受到{@damage 4d6}酸的伤害并沉入池子里，作为被抓捕的条件。拯救成功时，该生物会受到一半的酸液伤害，并且不会被抓捕。被抓捕的生物可以用它的行动对你的法术救赎DC进行力量（竞技）或灵巧（杂技）检查（由它选择）。如果成功，它就会释放自己。如果一个体型较大或较小的生物在已经被池子抓紧的情况下没有做出救赎动作，那么它也会被你的法术救赎系数所限制。",
	"A restrained creature can't breathe, and any non-magical metal objects it carries begin to corrode. When the restrained creature takes acid damage from the pool, non-magical metal weapons and armor take a permanent, cumulative -1 penalty to their damage rolls and AC, respectively. If this penalty on a weapon reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed; similarly, armor is destroyed if its AC is reduced to 10. Other metal objects take cumulative damage as well, as the pool eats through a 1- inch-thickness of non-magical metal each round it is immersed.": "被禁锢的生物不能呼吸，它携带的任何非魔法金属物品开始腐蚀。当被禁锢的生物受到池中的酸液伤害时，非魔法金属武器和盔甲的伤害卷和AC值分别受到永久的、累积的-1惩罚。如果武器的这个惩罚达到-5，武器就会被摧毁；同样地，如果盔甲的攻击力降低到10，它也会被摧毁。其他金属物体也会受到累积伤害，因为水池每浸泡一轮就会吃掉1英寸厚的非魔法金属。",
