Even after leaving the area, a creature is still coated with the acid and continues taking {@damage 2d8} acid damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature can use an action to rinse off the acid if it has water, vinegar, or another suitable substance available. All ongoing damage ends when the spell ends. The acid can also damage objects in the affected area, but the extent of this damage must be determined by the GM": "你在一个半径为20英尺、高30英尺的圆柱形区域内制造出一股腐蚀性的酸液，从你能看到的地方向下延伸。在持续时间内，每个在该区域内开始行动或进入该区域的生物都会受到{@damage 5d8}酸液伤害。即使离开该区域，生物仍会被酸液覆盖，并在其每个回合结束时继续受到{@damage 2d8}的酸液伤害。如果生物有水、醋或其他合适的物质，它可以使用行动来冲洗酸液。所有持续的伤害在法术结束时结束。酸液也可以损害受影响区域的物体，但损害的程度必须由GM决定。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|8-9|1d8} for each slot level above 7th.": "当你使用8级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，每超过7级的法术槽等级，伤害会增加（%0%）。",

	"You change an area of water you can see into a poisonous, toxic substance. The spell affects a maximum of 10,000 cubic feet of water (picture ten cubes, each 10 feet on a side). Each creature that begins its turn in the water or that enters the water takes {@damage 5d6} poison damage and becomes poisoned for as long as it stays in the corrupt water; a successful Constitution saving throw negates the effect on that creature. If the affected area is part of a larger body of water, new water entering the area becomes poisonous while water leaving the area is no longer affected": "你将一个你能看到的水的区域变成有毒的、有毒性的物质。该法术最多影响10,000立方英尺的水（图中有10个立方体，每边10英尺）。每个开始在水中的生物或进入水中的生物都会受到{@damage 5d6}的中毒伤害，并且只要它在腐败的水中停留，就会中毒；如果宪法救赎成功，就会否定对该生物的影响。如果受影响的区域是一个更大的水体的一部分，进入该区域的新水会变得有毒，而离开该区域的水则不再受影响。",

	"You send a seed at a living creature in range that implants itself in their skin. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, the target is drained for {@damage 2d4} necrotic damage immediately, and by {@damage 2d4} necrotic damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns until it reaches 0 HP or the duration is over. The damage is restored as hp by the user. You can seed up to 4 creatures. When the duration is over the creature becomes immune to this spell for 12 hours.": "你向范围内的生物发送一颗种子，将自己植入他们的皮肤中。进行一次远程攻击。一旦命中，目标立即受到{@damage 2d4}的坏死伤害，并在随后的每个回合结束时受到{@damage 2d4}的坏死伤害，直到它达到0HP或持续时间结束。伤害由使用者恢复为hp。你最多可以播种4个生物。当持续时间结束后，该生物将在12小时内对该法术免疫。",
