	"You call up a ghostly fiddle bow in the air above the targeted creature. This bow immediately descends into the target body and begins to saw back and forth against its skeleton. Although the music produced is eerily beautiful, it causes intense pain and anguish in the victim.": "你在目标生物上方的空中召唤出一张幽灵般的小提琴弓。这张弓立即落入目标的身体，并开始在它的骨架上来回拉锯。虽然所产生的音乐异常动听，但它会给受害者带来强烈的痛苦和折磨。",
	"An affected target must make a Constitution save at the start of it's turn or suffer {@dice 3d6} points of thunder damage and a disadvantage on Stealth checks. A successful save ends the effect of the spell.": "受影响的目标必须在它的回合开始时进行宪法救赎，否则会受到{@dice 3d6}点雷霆伤害，并在隐身检查中处于劣势。拯救成功后，该法术的效果就会结束。",
	"The target must have a skeleton or an exoskeleton for the spell to have effect.": "目标必须有骨架或外骨骼，法术才能生效。",
	"A small but extremely loud bee appears, buzzing around the head of the designated target. This spell creates an unnerving noise that disrupts the target's concentration and makes it much harder to hide. While the spell is active, the target has disadvantage on Stealth checks. Also, if the target has to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain it's concentration, the DC of that saving throw cannot be lower than your Spell Save DC.": "一只小而极响的蜜蜂出现，在指定目标的头上嗡嗡作响。这个法术会产生一种令人不安的噪音，扰乱目标的注意力，使其更难隐藏。当咒语激活时，目标在隐身检查中处于不利地位。此外，如果目标必须进行宪法救赎以保持其注意力，该救赎的DC不能低于你的法术救赎DC。",
	"The bee is incorporeal and can't be attacked, but can be dispelled. The bee loses track of the target if the target moves more than 120 feet in a single round, but is not fooled by darkness, invisibility, cover, or any other attempt at disguising or hiding.": "蜜蜂是无体的，不能被攻击，但可以被驱散。如果目标在一个回合内移动超过120英尺，蜜蜂就会失去对目标的追踪，但不会被黑暗、隐身、掩护或任何其他试图伪装或隐藏的行为所欺骗。",
	"This spell brings to your mind a song that helps you retain your concentration. The song does not distract you from any task at hand—on the contrary, by humming along to the tune, you can focus your mind with ease.": "这个咒语为你带来一首帮助你保持注意力的歌曲。这首歌不会让你从手头的任何任务中分心--相反，通过跟着曲子哼唱，你可以轻松地集中精神。",
	"As long as this spell is in effect, you can make a Perform check in place of a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.": "只要这个咒语生效，你就可以用 \"表演 \"检查来代替 \"宪法 \"救赎来保持注意力。",
	"You jab your weapon into the air as if in triumph, letting out a cry of victory before you have even made your attack. Foes around you seem surprised by your display even as the feeling grows within you that you cannot fail": "你把你的武器刺向空中，仿佛是为了胜利，在你还没有发动攻击之前就发出了胜利的呼声。你周围的敌人似乎对你的表现感到惊讶，甚至在你内心滋生出你不会失败的感觉。",
	"If you make an Attack action in this round, you can move 15 feet as part of it, but only before the first attack. That attack is made with advantage and deals additional {@damage 1d6} damage of the weapon's type. If the attack hits, the target must also make a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of you until the end of it's next turn. ": "如果你在这个回合中做出攻击动作，你可以作为动作的一部分移动15英尺，但只在第一次攻击之前。该攻击是以优势进行的，并造成该武器类型的额外（%0%）伤害。如果攻击命中，目标也必须进行智慧救赎，否则就会变成你的（%1%），直到下一回合结束。"
