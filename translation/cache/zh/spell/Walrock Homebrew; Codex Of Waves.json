	"For the duration, you are encased fully in a bubble of air. The bubble is a sphere that extends out in a 10 foot radius centered on you, moves with you, and is fully transparent and permeable by creatures, weapons, items, objects, spells, and terrarin, none of which pop the bubble. Any creature within the bubble are able to breathe fresh air, regardless of what is outside the bubble.": "在持续时间内，你被完全包裹在一个空气泡泡里。这个气泡是一个球体，以你为中心延伸出10英尺的半径，与你一起移动，并且是完全透明的，可以被生物、武器、物品、物体、法术和恐怖法术所渗透，没有任何一种东西可以打破这个气泡。泡泡内的任何生物都能呼吸到新鲜空气，不管泡泡外是什么。",
	"Should the bubble be submerged in liquid, creatures within the bubble can't swim. Rather, creatures other than yourself may use their normal movement speed to exit the bubble, and, while inside the bubble with you, friendly creatures move along with the bubble. The bubble floats halfway submerged at the surface of any liquids by default, and you may use your normal movement speed to move the bubble in any direction horizontally.": "如果泡泡被淹没在液体中，泡泡内的生物就不能游泳。相反，除了你自己以外的生物可以使用他们的正常移动速度离开泡泡，而且，当你和泡泡在一起时，友好的生物会随着泡泡一起移动。默认情况下，泡泡会半淹没在任何液体的表面，你可以使用你的正常移动速度将泡泡向任何方向水平移动。",
	"You may also cause the bubble to float or sink by using a bonus action. A floating or sinking bubble slowly rises or drops (respectively) 30 feet at the end of your turn until you make contact with the ground, another solid object, or the liquids surface. Should you land on a solid surface of ground beneath a liquid, you may walk along this ground using your normal movement speed, the bubble and other friendly creatures travelling along with you as usual.": "你也可以通过使用一个额外的动作使气泡浮起或下沉。漂浮或下沉的气泡在你的回合结束时慢慢上升或下降（分别）30英尺，直到你接触到地面、其他固体物体或液体的表面。如果你降落在液体下面的固体地面上，你可以用你的正常移动速度沿着这个地面行走，泡泡和其他友好的生物照常与你同行。",
	"The bubble may be used to safely submerge in acid or any liquid with a caustic or poisonous nature, without taking damage. Lava or any liquid that would deal damage due to heat, cold, or magical properties still causes damage to those within the bubble, but the damage is reduced by half.": "这个气泡可以用来安全地浸泡在酸或任何具有腐蚀性或有毒性质的液体中，而不会受到伤害。熔岩或任何会因热、冷或魔法特性而造成伤害的液体仍会对气泡内的人造成伤害，但伤害会减少一半。",

While covered in barnacles, the creature has disadvantage on attacks, Dexterity saving throws, and Charisma checks. At the end of each turn the creature is still covered in barnacles, it takes {@dice 1d6} acid damage. A creature within 5 feet if the target of the spell map attempt to remove the barnacles by using an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If this check succeeds, the spell ends.": "选择一个你能看到的范围内的生物。目标必须在宪法规定的投掷中成功，否则在咒语的持续时间内从头到脚都被不同大小的藤壶所覆盖。当被藤壶覆盖时，该生物在攻击、灵巧救赎和魅力检查方面都处于劣势。在生物仍然被藤壶覆盖的每个回合结束时，它将受到{@dice 1d6}酸的伤害。如果法术地图的目标在5英尺范围内的生物试图移除藤壶，可以用一个动作对你的法术救赎DC进行力量检查。如果这个检定成功，法术结束。",

A vehicle may only benefit from one instance of this spell at any time.": "作为这个法术的一部分，你触摸你目前所在的水运或空运车辆。在这个法术的持续时间内，这辆车的速度乘以1.5，并且无视来自困难地形区（或类似地区）的移动减少。在此咒语结束前，车辆上或车辆内的角色可以选择在任何一个能使车辆不受伤害的检查或拯救动作上获得优势。一辆汽车在任何时候都只能从这个法术的一个实例中受益。",
	"With a gesture, you summon a roaring wave of water to buffet a creature within range. Target a creature within range, and make a ranged spell attack against the create and against two other creatures within 10 feet of your chosen target.

	"You conjure a powerful explosion of water, scattering creatures affected by it. Choose a point within range. Creatures within a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. If a creature fails this saving throw, it takes {@dice 4d10} bludgeoning damage, and is knocked 15 feet away from the center of this explosion, and is rendered prone. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw takes half damage and is subject to no other effects from this spell.": "你召唤出一个强大的水爆炸，使受其影响的生物散开。在范围内选择一个点。以该点为中心的10英尺半径范围内的生物必须做一个力量储蓄动作。如果一个生物没有成功，它就会受到{@dice 4d10}重击伤害，并被打到离爆炸中心15英尺远的地方，并被打倒在地。蓄力成功的生物会受到一半的伤害，并且不会受到这个法术的其他影响。",

This sense can even detect creatures or obstacles that are invisible and in contact with the liquid, and can instantly discern illusions immersed in the liquid for what they actually are.": "你触摸一个愿意的生物，赋予它通过水体或其他液体扩展其感官的能力，即使小到一个水坑，大到一个落雨区，都能知道液体体所接触的一切的确切位置，最大距离为120英尺。这种感觉甚至可以探测到看不见的、与液体接触的生物或障碍物，并能立即辨别出浸泡在液体中的幻象的真实面目。",

If the creature fails this saving throw, however, it takes {@dice 3d6} bludgeoning damage, is rendered prone, and is carried to the top of the geyser.": "在范围内的地面上选择一个点。从这个点喷出一个底座为5英尺乘5英尺、高度为10英尺的间歇泉。如果一个体型较大或较小的生物在这个点上，它必须做一个灵巧的拯救动作。如果成功，该生物会移动到它选择的、未被间歇泉占据的最近的可利用空间。然而，如果该生物没有完成这个蓄力动作，它就会受到{@dice 3d6}重击伤害，变得俯卧，并被带到间歇泉的顶部。",

Eating one of these additional fish restores 1 hit point, and the fish provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.": "作为这个法术的一部分，你必须触碰钓竿、鱼叉、长矛、三叉戟、渔网或其他捕鱼用品。如果受影响的物品被用来捕鱼至少一小时，在接下来的24小时内，它会额外捕获价值{@dice 2d10}的鲭鱼或类似的本地小鱼，以及{@dice 1d4-2}《玩家手册》第160页Trinker表中的饰品（最低0）。吃下一条这些额外的鱼可以恢复1点生命值，而这些鱼提供的营养足以维持一个生物一天的生命。",

	"A sphere of crushing water forms around the head (or similar) of a creature you can see within range, and begins to exert an incredible force upon that creature. When you first cast this spell, the creature affected by it takes {@dice 6d10} bludgeoning damage.
