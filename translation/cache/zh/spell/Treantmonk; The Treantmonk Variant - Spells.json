	"You can store a prepared of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area and have an effect that is detrimental to the target. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.

You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.": "在范围内选择一个边长不超过40英尺的地形区域。你可以在持续时间内以你选择的任何方式重塑该区域的土、沙或粘土。你可以提高或降低该区域的海拔，创造或填埋一条沟渠，竖起或压平一堵墙，或形成一根柱子。任何此类改变的范围都不能超过该区域最大尺寸的一半。因此，如果你影响到一个40英尺的广场，你可以建立一个高达20英尺的支柱，提高或降低广场的高度，最多20英尺，挖一个最深的沟渠，等等。这些变化需要10分钟才能完成。",

	"This spell can't manipulate stone construction. Structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.": "这个法术不能操纵石头建筑。建筑物会转变以适应新的地形。如果你塑造地形的方式会使结构不稳定，它可能会倒塌。",

At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 80 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.": "如果你愿意，你可以在完成咒语后不发射地球。一个与吊坠石差不多大小的小球出现在你的手中，触感冰凉。在任何时候，你或你把小球交给的生物都可以把小球扔出去（范围为80英尺）或用吊索把它扔出去（吊索的正常范围）。它一经撞击就会破碎，其效果与正常施法的效果相同。你也可以将地球仪放下而不将其击碎。1分钟后，如果球体还没有碎裂，它就会爆炸。",

	"A dancing creature must use all its movement and its action to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls.

	"You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. Any illusory effect that would impose a condition (such as blindness) on a target is ineligible.": "你制作一个幻象，在你能看到的范围内的一个生物的头脑中扎根。目标必须做一个智力救赎动作。如果救赎失败，你会创造一个幻象、生物或其他你选择的可见现象，其大小不超过10英尺的立方体，并且在持续时间内只有目标可以察觉。这个法术对亡灵或构造物没有影响。任何会对目标施加条件（如失明）的虚幻效果是不合格的。",

	"While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.": "当目标受到法术的影响时，目标会把幻象当作真实的一样对待。目标会将与幻象互动的任何不合逻辑的结果合理化。例如，一个目标试图走过一座横跨鸿沟的幻象桥，一旦踏上桥就会摔倒。如果目标在坠落过程中幸存下来，它仍然相信桥是存在的，并为它的坠落想出一些其他的解释--它被推了，它滑倒了，或者可能是强风把它吹走了。",
	"An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal {@damage 1d6} psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.": "受影响的目标会非常相信幻象的真实性，甚至会受到幻象的伤害。一个被创造成生物的幻象可以攻击目标。同样地，一个被创造成火、酸池或熔岩的幻象可以烧毁目标。在你的回合中，如果目标在幻象的区域内或在幻象的5英尺范围内，每回合幻象可以对其造成（%0%）精神伤害，前提是幻象是一个在逻辑上可以造成伤害的生物或危险，例如攻击。目标感知到的伤害是与幻象相适应的类型。",
	"You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 4d10} psychic damage and becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. At the beginning of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the creature takes {@damage 4d10} psychic damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.": "你在你能看到的范围内挖掘一个生物的噩梦，并创造一个其最深层恐惧的虚幻表现，只对该生物可见。目标必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果拯救失败，目标会受到{@damage 4d10}精神伤害，并在持续时间内变成{@condition frightened}。在咒语结束前，目标的每个回合开始时，该生物会受到（%2%）的精神伤害。在它的每个回合结束时，目标可以做一个智慧拯救动作。如果成功，法术结束。",
