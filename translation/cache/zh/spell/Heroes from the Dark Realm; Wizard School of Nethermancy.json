	"Nethermancy was created when wizards fled to Shadowfell hundreds of years ago and searched through the plane's many secrets. The original nethermancers found shadow magic as the reason for the Shadowfell's creation. The strength of shadow magic derives from the dark energy that the primordials rejected when they first gave form to substance. Nethermancers focus on pulling raw shadow from their environment and then forcing it into arcane forces to create magical effects.": "Nethermancy是在几百年前巫师们逃到Shadowfell并通过这个平面的许多秘密进行搜索时创造的。最初的尼瑟曼人发现影子魔法是影子城创造的原因。影子魔法的力量来自于原始人第一次赋予物质形式时拒绝的黑暗能量。阴阳师专注于从他们的环境中提取原始的影子，然后将其强行转化为奥术力量，创造出神奇的效果。",

	"Beginning at 10th level, your shadow can become a physical being and guard you as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose your shadow between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the shadow returns to its normal state. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "从10级开始，你的影子可以变成一个实体，并作为对危险的一种即时的、几乎是本能的反应来保护你。当一个生物对你进行攻击时，你可以用你的反应在攻击者和你之间插入你的影子。攻击会自动错过你，然后影子会恢复到正常状态。一旦你使用这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"Begining at 14th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible.

	"As an action, you create a magical weapon in your hand with the properties of any melee martial weapon that is not magical. If there are any abillity requirenments or rolls involving Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution in order to use the weapon, you can use your spellcasting ability for the roll or abillity requirenment instead. Any slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage made with the weapon becomes necrotic or phsyicic instead (your choice).": "作为一个动作，你在手中创造一个魔法武器，其属性与任何非魔法的近战武术武器相同。如果在使用该武器时有任何能力要求或涉及力量、灵巧或体质的卷轴，你可以使用你的法术能力来代替该卷轴或能力要求。使用该武器造成的任何砍伤、刺伤或重击伤害都会变成坏死或幻觉伤害（由你选择）。",

Once per round as a bonus action, you can move the shadow monsters up to 30 feet each. Enemies take a -2 penalty to all attack rolls while 5 feet to a shadow monster.
