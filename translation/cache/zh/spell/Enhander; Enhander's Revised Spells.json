	"On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver.

If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.": "在你的每个回合中，直到咒语结束，你都可以使用一个额外的动作，用一个使用箭筒里的弹药的武器进行两次攻击。每次你进行这样的远程攻击时，你的箭筒会神奇地将你使用的弹药替换成类似的非魔法弹药片。任何由该法术产生的弹药都会在法术结束时解体。如果箭筒离开了你，该法术也会结束。",
	"You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you.
