	"Should the beast ever be slain, you can use this figurine in place of the creature's body for the purpose of resurrection. The beast's bond to the figurine ends if either you or the beast spend 10 minutes focusing on your bond to do so, or if the figurine is broken. The beast can choose to break the bond even while inside of the figurine. If the bond is ended while the beast is inside of figurine, the beast immediately appears in the nearest unoccupied space to the figurine.": "如果这个野兽被杀死，你可以用这个小雕像来代替它的身体，以达到复活的目的。如果你或野兽花了10分钟专注于你们之间的联系，或者如果小雕像被打破，那么野兽与小雕像的联系就会结束。即使在小雕像内，野兽也可以选择打破纽带。如果纽带在小雕像内被终止，小雕像会立即出现在离小雕像最近的空位上。",
