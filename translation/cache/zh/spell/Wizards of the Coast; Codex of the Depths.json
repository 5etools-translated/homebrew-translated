	"This spell causes one Large or larger creature to be reduced in size and pacified for easier handling. The target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to negate the spell's effect. On a failed save, the target's size is reduced to one-quarter in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-sixteenth of normal. Equipment worn or held by the creature is likewise reduced in size and weight. Any item dropped by the target creature returns to normal size at once.": "这个咒语会使一个大型或更大的生物体型缩小并被安抚，以便更容易处理。目标可以尝试用智慧救赎来否定该法术的效果。如果救赎失败，目标的体型在所有尺寸上都会缩小到四分之一，其重量会减少到正常的十六分之一。该生物所穿戴或持有的装备也同样被缩小尺寸和重量。任何被目标生物掉落的物品都会立即恢复到正常大小。",
	"While so reduced, a creature has its mind and instincts transformed, imposing disadvantage on Strength saving throws, suppressing strong emotions, and putting the creature into a state of complete calm. The creature does not attack or engage in combat unless it is attacked or otherwise provoked, which ends the spell.": "在如此减少的时候，一个生物的思想和本能都被改变了，在力量投掷中处于劣势，压制了强烈的情绪，并使该生物进入完全平静的状态。该生物不会攻击或参与战斗，除非它受到攻击或其他挑衅，从而结束咒语。",
	"If powdered ruby worth at least 200 gp is used as the spell's material component instead of powdered pearl, the duration is doubled and the saving throw is made with disadvantage.": "如果使用价值至少200gp的红宝石粉而不是珍珠粉作为咒语的材料成分，那么持续时间会增加一倍，并且以劣势进行蓄力。",
	"This spell causes an aquatic creature and a volume of water surrounding it to be instantly teleported to a destination you select. The creature and the volume of water can be no larger than a 40-foot cube. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be within 20 miles of you. Your familiarity with the destination determines the success of the transposition. The DM rolls {@dice d100} and consults the table.": "这个法术使一个水生生物和它周围的水体瞬间被传送到你选择的目的地。该生物和水的体积不能大于40英尺的立方体。你选择的目的地必须是你所知道的，而且必须在你周围20英里之内。你对目的地的熟悉程度决定了移位的成功与否。管理员掷出{@dice d100}并查阅表格。",
	"Permanent circle": "永久性圆圈",
	"Associated object": "关联对象",
	"Very familiar": "非常熟悉",
	"Seen casually": "随意看到的",
	"Viewed once": "查看过一次",
	"Description": "描述",
	"False destination": "虚假的目的地",
	"\"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a piece of wood taken from a pier, a pebble taken from a cave, or a brick from a harbor wall. ": "\"永久圈 \"是指一个永久的传送圈，其标志序列你知道。\"相关物品 \"是指你拥有在过去六个月内从所需目的地取得的物品，例如从码头取得的一块木头，从洞穴取得的一块卵石，或从港口墙上取得的一块砖头。",
	"\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is some place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.

	"The creature and the water surrounding it appear where you want them to.": "生物和它周围的水出现在你想要的地方。",
	"The creature and the volume of water around it appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is {@dice 1d10 × 1d10} percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to transpose a creature 20 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two {@dice d10}s, then the creature would be off target by 15 percent, or 3 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a {@dice d8} and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.": "该生物和它周围的水体出现在离目的地一个随机方向的随机距离上。偏离目标的距离是要走的距离的{@dice 1d10 × 1d10}百分比。例如，如果你试图将一个生物移到20英里之外，落在目标之外，并在两个{@dice d10}上掷出5和3，那么这个生物将偏离目标15%，或3英里。DM通过掷出{@dice d8}并指定1为北，2为东北，3为东，以此类推，围绕罗盘的各个点，随机决定偏离目标的方向。",
	"The creature ends up in a random location in the nearest natural body of water, such as a pond, river, lake, or sea.": "该生物最终会在最近的自然水体中的一个随机位置，例如池塘、河流、湖泊或海洋。",
	"The spell's magic is badly corrupted. There is a 20 percent chance that the creature materializes at a random height directly above its point of origin. Otherwise, it materializes at a random distance and direction from the starting point, at the DM's discretion.": "该咒语的魔力被严重破坏。有20%的几率，生物会在其起始点正上方的一个随机高度上实体化。否则，它将在离起点的一个随机距离和方向上实体化，由DM决定。"
