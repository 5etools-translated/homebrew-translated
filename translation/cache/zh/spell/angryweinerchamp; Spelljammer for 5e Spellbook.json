	"When a creature enters within 30 feet of the orb for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward the orb. When a creature enters within 5 feet of the orb for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 10d10} bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.": "当生物第一次进入球体的30英尺范围内或在那里开始它的回合时，它必须做一个力量救赎动作，否则会被拉向球体10英尺。当一个生物在一个回合中第一次进入球体的5英尺范围内，或者在那里开始它的回合，它必须做一个宪法救赎，如果救赎失败会受到{@damage 10d10}重击伤害，如果救赎成功会受到一半的重击。",
	"The orb's gravitation makes moving away from it incredibly difficult. While within 10 feet of the orb, a creature moving away from the orb must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. While within 30 feet of the orb, a creature moving away from the orb must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.": "球体的引力使得远离它变得异常困难。当在球体的10英尺范围内，一个生物远离球体时，每移动1英尺必须花费4英尺的移动距离。当在球体的30英尺范围内时，离开球体的生物每移动1英尺就必须花费2英尺的移动距离。",

If the target of this spell is returned to life, this spell ends and the constellation fades": "这个法术有效地延长了使目标人物起死回生的时间限制，因为在这个法术影响下的日子并不计入诸如起死回生等法术的时间限制。一个以死者为目标但通常需要尸体的法术可以以这个星座为目标来施展，只要该法术是在夜间施展，并且施法者能看到目标的星座。如果这个法术的目标被恢复了生命，这个法术就会结束，而这个星座也会消失。",

Also, the spell will not function in areas that the power has been specifically banished from (whether from death of an avatar, banishment, or some voluntary action of the god).": "这个咒语的使用者通过星海在他现在的位置和他们所敬仰的力量之间建立了一个脆弱的联系。这种联系允许牧师重新获得他的法术，就像神在球体中被认可和敬仰一样。距离对牧师试图联系家乡的力量没有影响，但维度之门、反幻想领域和驱散魔法的效果会阻止该咒语的使用。此外，该咒语在该力量被特别放逐的区域（无论是由于化身的死亡、放逐还是神的某些自愿行为）不会发挥作用。",
	"The cleric attempting to uplink with his power in such locations will be informed through the spell that such contact with his god is forbidden. The priest will not be given the reasons, as gods are noticeably reticent to explain why they cannot exert their power, preferring instead to look all-powerful to their worshipers.": "试图在这种地方与他的力量联接的牧师将通过咒语被告知，与他的神的这种接触是禁止的。牧师不会被告知原因，因为神明显不愿意解释他们为什么不能发挥他们的力量，而是更愿意在他们的崇拜者面前显得无所不能。",
	"The duration of the spell is one week, as long as the cleric remains in the same crystal sphere in which he cast the spell. Passage into another plane (even the ethereal) will break the spell, as will a dispel magic effect.

At 2nd level he may create air for two medium sized individuals, at 3rd level sufficient air for three, and so on.": "这个咒语每超过一级，牧师就可以为另外一个人创造足够的空气。在第二级时，他可以为两个中等身材的人创造空气，在第三级时为三个人创造足够的空气，以此类推。",
	"Creating additional air around a single individual does not create a larger envelope; the excess air will simply drift off. The caster can refresh the air within his own personal air envelope and that of others within the range of the spell, without needing to touch those individuals.": "在一个人周围制造额外的空气并不能创造一个更大的包络；多余的空气会简单地飘走。施法者可以刷新他个人的空气包络以及在咒语范围内的其他人的空气，而不需要接触这些人。",

	"Creating a helm (major or minor)counts as the casting of one spell, and may reduce the caster's effectiveness in using the helm for that day (if the caster has used all of his remaining 7th level spells). Of course, this does not mean another spellcaster cannot act as the helmsman, using a helm created by another person.": "创造一个头盔（主要的或次要的）算作施放一个法术，并可能降低施法者当天使用头盔的效果（如果施法者已经使用了他所有剩余的7级法术）。当然，这并不意味着另一个施法者不能作为舵手，使用由他人创造的头盔。",

	"It takes but a fraction of a round for a ship to pass through a portal opened in this fashion. Portals created by this spell are magical and temporary, so they can be dispelled. Portals that occur naturally in the crystal shell may not be dispelled. The material component of the create portal spell is a piece of wire wrapped about a bit of amber.": "一艘船通过以这种方式打开的传送门只需要一个回合的一小部分时间。由这个法术创造的传送门是神奇的、暂时的，所以它们可以被驱散。在水晶壳中自然产生的传送门可能不会被驱散。创造传送门咒语的物质成分是一块包裹着一点琥珀的金属丝。",
