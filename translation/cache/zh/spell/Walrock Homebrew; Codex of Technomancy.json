	"As a part of casting this spell, choose an object of any size within range. You immediately learn whether or not the object is magical (but not its properties), what the object is made of, and approximately how old the object is. If the object has a monetary worth, you learn that, as well. You also learn if the object is trapped, and what types of damage, if any, the object is vulnerable, immune, or resistant to. ": "作为施法的一部分，在范围内选择一个任意大小的物体。你会立即了解该物体是否有魔力（但不包括其属性），该物体是由什么制成的，以及该物体大约有多老。如果该物体有货币价值，你也会知道。你还可以了解该物体是否被困住，以及该物体对哪些类型的伤害（如果有的话）是脆弱的、免疫的或抵抗的。",
	"If the object is actually a creature (such as an awak-ened armor or a rug of smothering), you learn that it is a creature, but gain no other information.": "如果该物体实际上是一个生物（比如一个被唤醒的盔甲或窒息的地毯），你会了解到它是一个生物，但没有获得其他信息。",
	"This spell requires a vaguely human-shaped, Medium sized, non-living target, such as a suit of armor, a scarecrow, or a specially-constructed golem body. Non-living plant materials can be a part of the target's construction, but not flesh and bone. ": "这个法术需要一个模糊的人形，中等大小的非生物目标，例如一套盔甲，一个稻草人，或者一个特别建造的傀儡身体。非生命的植物材料可以成为目标的构造的一部分，但不能是肉体和骨骼。",
	"Once this spell is cast, the target comes alive as an animated construct, the statistics of which are included here. The target has no will of its own, and instead must be mentally or verbally commanded to take actions with a bonus action on your turn while the construct is within 120 feet of you. You can command it to take either a general course of action, or you can specifically decide where it moves and what it does within its next turn. The construct acts on its own turn in initiative order. ": "一旦这个咒语被施放，目标就会像一个有生命力的构造物一样活过来，这里包括了它的统计数据。目标没有自己的意志，而是必须在精神上或口头上命令它在你的回合中采取额外的行动，而这个构造物在你的120英尺之内。你可以命令它采取一般的行动，或者你可以具体决定它在下一回合的移动位置和行动。构造体在它自己的回合中按主动权顺序行动。",
	"The construct continues to follow given orders until it is commanded to stop or change what it is doing. If given no commands, the construct takes no actions, neither defending itself or removing itself from harm unless instructed to do so. ": "构造体会继续遵循给定的命令，直到它被命令停止或改变它正在做的事情。如果没有得到任何命令，构造体就不会采取任何行动，除非得到指示，否则它既不会保护自己也不会使自己免受伤害。",
	"Once each day, the construct can be repaired to full hit points by either an hour's worth of effort by a creature using and proficient in artisan's tools, or a casting of the mending spell. A repaired construct cannot be repaired again for 24 hours. ": "每天一次，通过使用并精通工匠工具的生物的一小时努力，或者施展修补法术，构筑物可以被修复到满值。被修复的建筑在24小时内不能再次被修复。",
	"Once this spell's duration expires, the construct returns to its inanimate state. You can prolong the spell's duration by an additional 24 hours by casting the spell again while the construct is still active, using a spell slot of at least the level used in the spell's initial casting. Cast in this way, this spell has an instantaneous casting time. ": "一旦此咒语的持续时间过期，构装体就会回到其无生命的状态。你可以在构装体仍处于活动状态时再次施放该法术，并使用一个至少是最初施法时所用等级的法术槽，从而将该法术的持续时间额外延长24小时。以这种方式施法，这个咒语有一个瞬间的施法时间。",
	"Regardless, you cannot have more than one construct animated by this spell at any time unless otherwise specified.": "无论如何，除非另有规定，否则你在任何时候都不能有一个以上的构造物被这个法术激发出来。",
	"When you cast this spell with a slot of 7th level or higher, you can choose to make the con-struct sized Large, if the construct body targeted is of the appropriate size. A Large construct created by this spell has a hit point maximum of 75 ({@dice 9d10 + 25}), a Strength and Constitution score of 20, a movement speed of 35 feet, and can make an additional third attack when it uses its Multiattack ability. ": "当你用7级或更高等级的槽施放这个法术时，你可以选择使构装体的大小为大型，如果所针对的构装体有适当的大小。由该法术创造的大型构装体的最大命中率为75（（%0%）），力量和体质分数为20，移动速度为35英尺，并且当它使用多重攻击能力时可以额外进行第三次攻击。",
	"When you cast this spell with a slot of 8th level or higher, you can choose to make the construct self-aware if it is sized Medium, increasing its Intelligence score to 12 and its Charisma score to 11. You can issue orders to a self-aware construct without a bonus action, but the construct is not obligated to obey them, and will act inde-pendently in its own self interest. ": "当你用8级以上的槽施展这个法术时，如果构装体的体型为中型，你可以选择让它有自我意识，将它的智力分值提高到12，魅力分值提高到11。你可以向有自我意识的构装体发出命令而不需要额外的行动，但是构装体没有义务服从这些命令，它将独立地按照自己的利益行事。",
	"Self-aware constructs do not count against the limit on the number of constructs this spell can animate, and remain animated past the duration of this spell, until they are reduced to 0 hit points. ": "有自我意识的构筑物不计入此法术所能使的构筑物数量的限制，并且在此法术的持续时间后仍能保持其活力，直到它们被降低到0点。",
	"When you cast this spell with a 9th level spell slot, you can make the construct both Large sized and self-aware, granting it the bonuses from both.": "当你用9级的法术槽施展这个法术时，你可以让构装体同时具有大尺寸和自我意识，并赋予它两者的奖励。",
	"Targeting a simple non-magical mechanism within range, you awaken the benign spirit of that machine. For this purpose, a simple mechanism is something no more complex than the hinges on a door, a compass, a scale, a rope and pulley, a ship's wheel, the wheels on a wagon, or the latch on a window. ": "瞄准范围内一个简单的非魔法装置，你会唤醒该机器的良性精神。为此，简单的机械是指不比门上的铰链、罗盘、天平、绳索和滑轮、船轮、马车上的车轮或窗户上的门闩更复杂的东西。",
	"For the duration of this spell, the machine spirit responds to any commands you give it as a bonus action while you are within 120 feet of it, as if a creature with a Strength score of 25 was operating that machine. You can tell the spirit to open or close a door, window, or unlocked chest; lower or raise a rope in a pulley; or weigh down a scale, as examples. ": "在这个咒语的持续时间内，当你在120英尺范围内时，机器之灵会对你给它的任何命令做出反应，就像一个力量值为25的生物在操作该机器一样。你可以告诉它打开或关闭一扇门、窗户或未上锁的箱子；降低或提高滑轮中的绳子；或降低一个秤的重量，作为例子。",
	"The spirit will take no actions that would bring obvi-ous harm to their machine, such as slamming a window so hard it shatters. Further, a spirit can be commanded to follow a certain course of action, such as only opening a door for specified creatures. ": "灵魂不会采取任何会给他们的机器带来明显伤害的行动，比如用力摔碎一扇窗户。此外，精神可以被命令遵循某种行动路线，例如只为指定的生物开门。",
	"This machine spirit is invisible, intangible, and immune to all damage, but destroying their mechanism causes the spirit to die, and the spell to end. ": "这种机器精神是无形的，无形的，对所有的伤害都免疫，但破坏它们的机制会导致精神死亡，咒语也会结束。",
	"If this spell is cast on the same mechanism every day for one year, the spell's effects become permanent and no longer require concentration, though you can still only command a machine spirit while within 120 feet of its mechanism.": "如果在一年内每天对同一个机械施法，该法术的效果就会变成永久性的，并且不再需要集中注意力，不过你仍然只能在机械的120英尺范围内指挥机器的灵魂。",
	"When you cast this spell, place a piece of paper within the box used as a material component, and point the box with the hole facing what you wish to capture an image of. You must be holding the box to use this spell. ": "当你施展这个法术时，将一张纸放在作为材料组件的盒子里，并将盒子的孔对着你想要捕捉的图像。你必须拿着盒子才能使用这个法术。",
	"Casting this spell creates a still image on the paper of whatever the box was pointed at, from the perspective of the box. This image appears on the paper at the begin-ning of your next turn, and is accurate, detailed, and real-istic, and lasts indefinitely. ": "施放这个咒语可以在纸上创造一个静止的图像，从盒子的角度看，盒子所指向的是什么。这个图像会在你下一个回合开始时出现在纸上，并且准确、详细、逼真，并且无限期地持续下去。",
	"Invisible creatures and those on the ethereal plane also appear in images created by this spell. Casting this spell does not allow you to see these creatures in any form other than the image the spell produces.": "隐形生物和空灵界的生物也会出现在这个咒语所产生的图像中。施展这个法术并不允许你看到这些生物在法术产生的图像之外的任何形式。",
	"Target a Large or smaller creature within range, and a point on the ground within 5 feet of that creature. The creature must succeed a Strength saving throw, or become wrapped in spectral chains that tether the crea-ture to the point chosen. ": "目标是范围内的一个大型或小型生物，以及该生物5英尺内地面上的一个点。该生物必须成功地进行力量救赎，否则就会被幽灵锁链缠住，将该生物拴在所选的点上。",
	"A creature affected by this spell is unable to take reac-tions and cannot move more than 10 feet away from the point indicated. Any forced movement that would move the creature out of this radius instead moves the creature to its edge. ": "受此法术影响的生物无法采取应对措施，并且不能从指定的点移动超过10英尺。任何会将生物移出这个半径的强制移动，都会将生物移到其边缘。",
	"On its turn, the creature can attempt to break the chains by using an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check with disadvantage against your spell save DC, ending this spell on a success.": "在它的回合中，该生物可以通过使用一个行动来尝试打破锁链，在不利的情况下对你的法术保全DC进行力量（竞技）检查，成功后结束这个法术。",

	"You conjure a trap in a 10 foot cube at a location you see that you choose within range. This trap can be your choice of either a flame trap or a spike trap. At your DM's option, you may be able to make other types of traps with this spell, but they have the final say on what this spell can and cannot make. ": "你在你看到的范围内选择的地点，在10英尺的立方体中变出一个陷阱。这个陷阱可以是你选择的火焰陷阱或尖刺陷阱。在你的管理员的选择下，你可以用这个法术制造其他类型的陷阱，但他们对这个法术能和不能制造的东西有最终决定权。",
	"Additionally, you decide when you cast this spell if the trap triggers when a creature enters the trap's area, when a door or chest in or adjacent to the area is opened, or when a similar condition is met that you specify with your DM. The trap cannot discern friendly creatures from hostile creatures, nor can it tell creatures apart by type or any other characteristics. ": "此外，当你施放这个咒语时，你可以决定陷阱是否在生物进入陷阱区域时触发，或在该区域内或邻近的门或箱子被打开时触发，或在满足你与你的管理人指定的类似条件时触发。陷阱不能辨别友好的生物和敌对的生物，也不能通过类型或任何其他特征区分生物。",
	"When the trap is triggered, creatures in its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If a creature fails, it takes {@damage 3d8} fire or piercing damage, if the trap is a flame or a spike trap, respectively. If the creature succeeds, it takes half this damage. You know immediately that the trap has been triggered, and this spell ends.": "当陷阱被触发时，在其范围内的生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果生物失败，它将受到{@damage 3d8}火焰或穿刺伤害，如果该陷阱是火焰或尖刺陷阱的话。如果该生物成功，它将受到该伤害的一半。你会立即知道陷阱已经被触发，并且这个法术结束。",
	"The trap is nearly invisible, and creatures that suspect a trap is in an area can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to attempt to find it. A located trap can be disarmed by a creature adjacent to its area with a successful Intelligence (Arcana) or Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check made against your spell save DC. A successful disarm check or a casting of dispel magic (or similar) ends this spell, but you do not inherently know that the trap was disarmed.": "这个陷阱几乎是不可见的，怀疑某个区域有陷阱的生物可以用智力（调查）检查来对抗你的法术保全DC，试图找到它。定位后的陷阱可以被其附近的生物解除，只要对你的法术保全系数进行智力（Arcana）或灵巧（Thieves' Tools）检查成功即可。成功的解除检查或施放驱散魔法（或类似的）会结束这个咒语，但你并不清楚这个陷阱已经被解除了。",
	"When cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you choose to either increase area of the trap's cube by 5 feet, or increase the damage it deals by {@dice 1d8}, for each slot level above 2nd. You can choose individually, for each slot level above 2nd, which of these benefits applies to the trap. ": "当用3级以上的法术槽施放时，你可以选择将陷阱的立方体面积增加5英尺，或者将其造成的伤害增加（%0%），每超过2级的法术槽等级。你可以在2级以上的每一个法术槽等级中单独选择适用于该陷阱的这些好处。",
	"In addition to these benefits, a trap created with a 5th level slot or higher can instead have a duration of permanent. Such traps are still removed when they are triggered, disarmed, or affected by dispel magic or similar. You cannot have more than five permanent traps at any one time, and conjuring a new trap after reaching this limit dispels the oldest permanent trap you conjured with this spell.": "除了这些好处之外，用5级或更高等级的槽创建的陷阱反而可以有一个永久的持续时间。这样的陷阱在被触发、解除或受到驱散魔法或类似的影响时仍会被移除。你在任何时候都不能有超过5个永久性陷阱，在达到这个限制后再变出一个新的陷阱，会驱散你用这个法术变出的最古老的永久性陷阱。",
	"You conjure all the tools found in an workshop associ-ated with the artisan's tools you used as a part of this spell's casting. This can be a forge and casting molds for smith's tools, a glass furnace for glassblower's tools, a full kitchen with a stove and oven for chef's utensils, or similar. ": "你可以召唤出与你在施法过程中使用的工匠工具有关的工场中的所有工具。这可以是铁匠工具的锻炉和铸造模具，玻璃工匠工具的玻璃炉，厨师工具的带炉子和烤箱的完整厨房，或者类似的。",
	"The conjured workshop fits within a 10 foot cube centered on a point you choose within range, and comes complete with all the fuel or materials it would require to operate. The conjured workshop does not include a roof or shelter, however, and is open to the air unless it is conjured indoors. ": "变出的工场适合在一个10英尺的立方体内，以你选择的范围内的一个点为中心，并配有所有它所需要的燃料或材料来运作。然而，变出的工场并不包括屋顶或遮蔽物，除非是在室内变出的，否则是露天的。",
	"While within this workshop, a creature that has profi-ciency in the associated set of artisan's tools adds double their proficiency bonus instead of their normal bonus to checks made with those tools. Further, every day of labor to craft items in a conjured workshop counts as up to three days of labor, and only requires you expend 1/2 the normal materials cost for however much labor you do. If a workshop is conjured in the same location every day for a year, it becomes permanent.": "在这个工场中，对相关的工匠工具有专长的生物在使用这些工具进行检查时，会增加双倍的专长奖励，而不是正常的奖励。此外，在魔法工坊中制作物品的每一天的劳动都算作最多三天的劳动，而且无论你做多少劳动，都只需要花费正常材料成本的1/2。如果一个工场在一年内每天都在同一地点变出，它就会成为永久性的。",
	"Target a construct creature or an object within range. Your spell attempts to tear the target to its constituent pieces, magically removing bolts, screws, and any other conjoining pieces from the target's construction. ": "瞄准范围内的一个建筑生物或物体。你的法术试图将目标撕成碎片，用魔法从目标的结构中移除螺栓、螺丝和任何其他连接的碎片。",
	"If the target is a creature, it makes a Constitution saving throw, ignoring any advantage the creature has on saves against magic. This spell also ignores abilities that make a target creature's form immune to being altered. ": "如果目标是一个生物，它将进行宪法救赎，无视该生物对魔法救赎的任何优势。该法术也无视使目标生物的形态免于被改变的能力。",
	"A creature that fails this saving throw or an object targeted by the spell takes {@damage 10d6} piercing damage that cannot be lessened or ignored, and reduces its hit point maximum by half the amount of damage taken, lasting until a creature's next long rest or until an object is repaired for at least 1 hour. A creature that succeeds this saving throw takes half this amount of damage, which can be lessened or ignored normally, and suffers no other effects.": "失败的生物或该咒语所针对的物体会受到{@damage 10d6}的穿刺伤害，该伤害不能被减弱或忽略，并使其最大命中率降低一半，持续到生物的下一次长时休息或物体被修复至少1小时为止。成功完成这个蓄力动作的生物会受到一半的伤害，这个伤害可以正常减弱或忽略，并且不会受到其他影响。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@dice 2d6} for each slot level above 4th.": "当你使用五级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，每超过四级的法术槽等级，伤害会增加（%0%）。",
	"You conjure into being an impossibly complex machine, laden with gears, wheels, arms, legs, and myriad other parts composing its design. You decide the machine's appearance, but it is always size Large. ": "你创造了一个复杂得不能再复杂的机器，它充满了齿轮、轮子、手臂、腿和其他无数的部件，构成了它的设计。你决定机器的外观，但它的尺寸总是很大。",
	"When you create the machine, give it a purpose that you can express in 10 words or less, that cannot be vio-lent in nature. The machine will attempt to carry out this purpose (to the letter) to the best of its abilities, and will not stop performing this function until the purpose is complete, or until the spell's duration expires.": "当你创造机器时，给它一个你可以用10个字以内表达的目的，而且不能是暴力性质的。机器将试图尽其所能地执行这个目的，并且不会停止执行这个功能，直到目的完成，或者直到咒语的持续时间结束。",
	"Some examples of purposes for this machine could be: \"carry us to the next town,\" \"build a new house,\" \"dig a trench 50 feet long,\" \"collect every chicken you can find,\" or \"cause a huge distraction.\" If a machine is given a purpose that would cause obvious harm to others, it will stay motionless until a different purpose is given. A machine will attempt to carry out a purpose that would require a skilled artisan (\"forge 20 steel swords,\" for example), but the results will not be ideal. ": "这台机器的一些用途的例子可以是。\"把我们带到下一个城镇\"，\"建造一座新房子\"，\"挖一条50英尺长的沟渠\"，\"收集所有你能找到的鸡\"，或者 \"引起巨大的分心\"。如果一台机器被赋予一个会对他人造成明显伤害的目的，它将保持不动，直到被赋予一个不同的目的。一台机器将试图执行一个需要熟练工匠的目的（例如 \"锻造20把钢剑\"），但结果并不理想。",
	"The machine is a construct with a Strength score of 20, an AC of 19, 50 hit points, and a movement speed of 60 feet. When you create the machine, you can choose to give the machine either a flying speed of 20 feet, a burrow speed of 30 feet, or a swimming speed of 30 feet. In combat, the machine acts on your initiative, but can not attack.": "这台机器是一个结构体，力量值为20，攻击力为19，50点攻击力，移动速度为60英尺。当你创造机器时，你可以选择给机器一个20英尺的飞行速度，一个30英尺的钻洞速度，或者一个30英尺的游泳速度。在战斗中，机器根据你的主动权行动，但不能攻击。",
	"This spell temporarily transforms a willing creature you touch into a construct version of themselves, greatly increasing their durability. For the duration, an affected creature counts as a construct in addition to any other creature types they may have, the creature's weight quadruples, and the creature sinks if in water. ": "这个法术可以暂时将你接触到的自愿的生物转化为他们自己的构造版本，大大增加他们的耐久力。在持续时间内，受影响的生物除了他们可能拥有的任何其他生物类型外，还算作一个构装体，该生物的重量翻了两番，如果在水中，该生物会下沉。",
	"While under the effects of this spell, a creature gains the following benefits: ": "在此法术的作用下，生物获得以下好处。",
	"• The creature gains an AC of 19, unless its AC is greater. ": "- 该生物获得一个19的AC，除非其AC更大。"
