	"Other undead under your control obey the subject intelligent undead as if it were you. You may still give orders to the undead normally, superseding the orders of the subject of the spell. Once the spell ends, the intelligent undead is aware that it has been used in this way.": "在你控制下的其他亡灵会服从主体智能亡灵，就像它是你一样。你仍然可以正常地对亡灵下达命令，取代咒语主体的命令。一旦咒语结束，智能亡灵就会意识到它已经被以这种方式使用。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum duration for this spell increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 3rd.": "当你使用四级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，每超过三级的法术槽等级，此法术的最大持续时间就增加10分钟。",
	"You touch a single object and create a mystical connection with it. After you cast this spell, if the object is damaged, destroyed, moved, or touched at any later time, you instantly are aware of this fact. If another creature touches this object, you receive a mental image of the creature and the area within 60 feet of the object. This mental image sees through darkness, including magical darkness, and can see through illusions or other false effects. This image also counts as firsthand knowledge if you cast scrying on the creature that disturbed the object.": "你触摸一个物体，并与它建立一种神秘的联系。在你施展这个法术后，如果这个物体在以后的任何时候被损坏、破坏、移动或触碰，你会立即意识到这个事实。如果另一个生物触及此物，你会收到一个该生物和该物60英尺范围内的精神影像。这个精神影像可以看穿黑暗，包括魔法黑暗，并且可以看穿幻觉或其他虚假效果。如果你对扰乱该物体的生物施展窥探术，这个图像也算作第一手资料。",
	"You receive the mental alert if the item is disturbed for any reason, including if it is handled or touched with a long metal pole, a cat walks on it, or an earthquake knocks it over. You can also designate a verbal password that allows a creature to handle the object without sounding the mental alert. After being activated, the spell immediately ends on the object. Because of its costly material components, many wizards and sorcerers use this spell to safeguard valuable, rare items.": "如果该物品因任何原因受到干扰，包括被人处理或用长的金属杆触碰，猫在上面走动，或者地震把它撞倒，你都会收到精神警报。你也可以指定一个口头口令，允许生物处理该物品而不发出精神警报。被激活后，该咒语立即在该物体上结束。由于其昂贵的材料成分，许多魔法师和巫师使用这个咒语来保护有价值的稀有物品。",
	"A {@i watchware} spell counts as a magical trap for the purposes of spells, features, and effects.": "就法术、特征和效果而言，{@i watchware}的法术算作是一个魔法陷阱。"
