The figure speaks a few words in a booming voice that can be heard by any creature within 1 mile of the rift, before placing a hand over it and releasing a massive {@dice d20} dice through the rift, collapsing downwards to the point you chose.

	"You reach out to a deity or god that you have faith in. Requesting a prophecy from a deity you do not truly invest in may give you an improper reading. As you perform alchemy and magic over the boiling cauldron, green smoke billows upwards until it forms a vague shape of your deity's face. You tell the deity the name of a creature that you know, as well as a description of a goal that they have. The deity will then tell you two facts about the results of the creature pursuing the goal: a key to success and a foreboding omen.": "你向一个你有信仰的神灵或上帝伸出援手。向一个你并不真正信任的神灵请求预言，可能会给你一个不恰当的预言。当你对沸腾的大锅施展炼金术和魔法时，绿色的烟雾向上飘散，直到形成你的神灵的模糊形状。你告诉神灵一个你认识的生物的名字，以及他们的一个目标的描述。然后神灵会告诉你关于该生物追求目标的结果的两个事实：一个成功的关键和一个不祥的预兆。",

	"You receive knowledge about one result of what would happen if you fail to fulfill the prophecy properly.": "你收到的知识是关于如果你不能正确履行预言会发生什么的一个结果。",
	"For example, if you request a prophecy to know the readings about finding an archfey willing to grant you powers, your deity may tell you that you must locate an emerald with the name of the archfey inscribed in it as the key to success and may tell you that you might forever be trapped in the Feywild as the omen. In this case, if you do succeed in finding the emerald, it is guaranteed that you will meet this willing archfey. Divine beings are not necessarily omniscient, so if your deity does not know exactly how to respond without being misleading, or if a scenario is too easily changeable, they will reply with \"unsure\" and the spell ends. For example, asking your deity whether you will find true love one day may be met with \"unsure\" as a response.": "例如，如果你要求预言知道关于寻找愿意授予你力量的大帝的读数，你的神灵可能会告诉你，你必须找到一块刻有大帝名字的绿宝石作为成功的关键，并可能告诉你，你可能永远被困在妖精的世界里，作为预兆。在这种情况下，如果你真的成功找到了绿宝石，保证你会遇到这位心甘情愿的大主教。神灵不一定是全知全能的，所以如果你的神灵不知道该如何准确回应而不被误导，或者某个场景太容易改变，他们会回答 \"不确定\"，咒语就会结束。例如，问你的神灵你是否有一天会找到真爱，可能会得到 \"不确定 \"的回答。",
	"The truth of a prophecy is undeniably accurate, but the closer you are to your god, the more detailed and rewarding the reading given is. The more unlikely a prophecy is to be fulfilled, or the more extreme a goal is, the harder it is to find the key to success and the easier it is to fall for the foreboding omen. Only one prophecy can apply to a single creature at a time. If you attempt to request for a second prophecy before the first one is fulfilled on the same creature, your spell slot will be consumed and nothing happens. Once either the prophecy is fulfilled or if the DM decides it is not possible for the key to be found (the emerald is disintegrated in the previous example), the spell ends, the creature is made aware, and a new prophecy can now be applied.": "不可否认，预言的真实性是准确的，但你越接近你的神，给出的解读就越详细，越有收获。预言越是不可能实现，或者目标越是极端，就越难找到成功的关键，越容易被预示的预兆所迷惑。每次只有一个预言可以适用于一个生物。如果你试图在第一个预言在同一生物身上实现之前请求第二个预言，你的法术槽将被消耗，而且什么也不会发生。一旦预言实现，或者DM决定不可能找到钥匙（在前面的例子中绿宝石被分解了），咒语就会结束，该生物会被告知，现在可以应用新的预言。",
	"Casting this spell requires your deity to come up with a difficult answer as to not mislead you, and so you may or may not receive your prophecy immediately. If your deity responds immediately, the green smoke above the cauldron will display your prophecy to you visually, and maybe audibly. If not, then during the creature's next long rest, it will be visited by the god in its dreams, and it will receive it then. Attempting to cast prophecy again in the time before you or the creature receives an answer will force you to lose your spell slot without any effect.": "施展这个咒语需要你的神灵拿出一个困难的答案，以免误导你，所以你可能会也可能不会立即收到你的预言。如果你的神灵立即回应，大锅上方的绿烟会以视觉和声音的方式向你展示你的预言。如果没有，那么在生物的下一次长时间休息中，它将在梦中被神灵拜访，那时它将收到预言。在你或生物收到答案之前，试图再次施放预言将迫使你失去你的法术槽而没有任何效果。",

	"A thin beam of shining opaque light strikes down at a point within range. A creature casting this spell that is not of a good alignment fails to connect to a deity willing to send down this mote of divine power, expending the spell slot and ending the spell. If you see the sky and it is clear, the column of light seemingly descends from a point infinitely high up. Any clouds obstructing the path automatically disperse to form a large 100-foot radius circular area where the beam can pass through. If underground or in a place where the sky is not present, the roof where you center the column opens a bright divine fissure allowing the column to strike down, seemingly having come from an extraplanar dimension. Bright light extends out from the column in all directions to 150 feet, and dim light shines out to 150 feet beyond that. The light is considered natural light, extends around corners, and remains for the duration of the spell.": "一束闪亮的不透明的细光向范围内的一个点击落。施放此法术的生物如果不具备良好的排列方式，则无法与愿意降下此神力的神灵取得联系，消耗法术槽并结束此法术。如果你看到的是晴朗的天空，光柱似乎从一个无限高的地方降落。任何阻挡路径的云彩都会自动散开，形成一个半径为100英尺的大圆形区域，光柱可以通过。如果在地下或在一个没有天空的地方，你以柱子为中心的屋顶会打开一个明亮的神性裂缝，让柱子打下来，似乎是来自一个平面外的空间。明亮的光线从柱子的各个方向延伸到150英尺，而昏暗的光线则照耀到150英尺以外。这种光被认为是自然光，在角落里延伸，并在咒语的持续时间内保持。",
	"Upon casting this spell, every creature in a 10-foot radius cylinder of infinite height centered around the point you choose must make a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 20d10} radiant damage on a failed save and half as much on a success.

	"For every subsequent turn until the spell ends, you can use an action to cause the column to emit a burst of radiant light. Any creature within 40 feet of the center of the column must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its next turn and lose its concentration. Additionally, the creature takes {@damage 8d10} radiant damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. This 40-foot radius is also considered difficult terrain and the bright light rays that extend from the column makes the area lightly obscured.": "在随后的每个回合，直到咒语结束，你可以使用一个动作使柱子发出一阵光芒。在柱子中心40英尺范围内的任何生物都必须在宪法救赎中成功，否则在下一回合结束前会受到（%0%）的影响，并失去注意力。此外，如果救赎失败，该生物会受到{@damage 8d10}的辐射伤害，如果救赎成功，会受到一半的辐射伤害。这个40英尺的半径也被认为是困难的地形，从柱子上延伸出来的明亮的光线使这个区域变得轻度模糊。",
	"If the spell lasts for the full duration, the divine light imprints a holy symbol into the ground where it is cast. As the column retracts upwards, a glowing runic symbol relating to the deity that facilitated the spell's casting appears in the burnt crater that the light created. Soft white sparks fly out of the symbol and it gives off a low hiss that resembles the sound of radiant fire. The symbol emits dim light out to 20 feet, and any creature not of a good alignment that enters the 10-foot area for the first time on their turn or starts its turn there takes 50 radiant damage. The symbol remains inscribed in the ground for 1 hour.": "如果咒语持续了整个持续时间，神圣之光就会在施法的地面上印下一个神圣的符号。当柱子向上缩回时，一个与促进施法的神灵有关的发光的符文符号出现在光所造成的烧焦的坑中。柔和的白色火花从符号中飞出，它发出低沉的嘶嘶声，类似于辐射火的声音。符号发出昏暗的光，向外延伸至20英尺，任何非善良的生物在他们的回合中第一次进入10英尺的区域或在那里开始回合，都会受到50点辐射伤害。符号在地面上保持1小时。",
	"You place a subtle mental tracker on a creature you touch, attempting to create a directional link between you and the target.

	"Until the spell ends, your mental compass allows you to know the exact direction you must travel in to reach the target. If the creature enters another plane of existence, you know which plane it entered and the compass now points to the location it was last. A creature with {@sense truesight} or can see invisibility knows that a mark is placed on them to scry it's location, as an {@condition invisible} crown of rings lay above the target's head.": "在咒语结束之前，你的精神罗盘允许你知道你必须前往的确切方向以到达目标。如果该生物进入了另一个存在平面，你就知道它进入了哪个平面，罗盘现在指向它最后所在的位置。一个拥有{@sense truesight}或能看到隐形的生物知道在他们身上有一个标记，以探查它的位置，因为一个{@condition invisible}的环形皇冠躺在目标的头上。",
	"You can choose to cast this spell in a different way by using your action to infuse this spell into a projectile.
