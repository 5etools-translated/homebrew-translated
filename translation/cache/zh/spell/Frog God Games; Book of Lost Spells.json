	"You create a 20-foot cube of sticky webs at a point you can see. Abiding webs works identically to web, except as noted otherwise.": "你在你能看到的地方创造一个20英尺的粘性网的立方体。粘网的作用与网相同，除非另有说明。",
	"These webs are crawling with tiny, harmless spiders. Damage to the web is repaired by the spiders that live in it, at the rate of one 5-foot cube per round (125 cubic feet; the entire volume of the webs can be sixteen times this size). This repair occurs on initiative count 20. If the webs are completely destroyed, the spell ends. The spiders themselves are immortal and need neither air nor food to survive; the magic of the spell produces more spiders as needed.": "这些网中爬满了微小的、无害的蜘蛛。对网的损害由生活在其中的蜘蛛来修复，修复的速度是每回合一个5英尺的立方体（125立方英尺；整个网的体积可以是这个大小的16倍）。这种修复发生在主动性计数20时。如果蜘蛛网被完全摧毁，则法术结束。蜘蛛本身是不死的，既不需要空气也不需要食物来生存；咒语的魔力会根据需要产生更多的蜘蛛。",
	"You cause a small object of up to a pound in weight to sink harmlessly into the flesh of the target. Magical rings, amulets, or other items melded in this way still give their benefits to the wearer as if they were being worn. A slight warping of the flesh and a magical aura are the only clues to the item's existence. Items carried in this way are considered attuned to the recipient and count toward the limit of how many items can be attuned. If the creature is already at the limit, the spell fails to take effect.": "你使一个重量不超过一磅的小物体无害地沉入目标的肉体中。魔法戒指、护身符或其他以这种方式融合的物品仍然会给佩戴者带来好处，就像它们被佩戴在身上一样。肉体的轻微扭曲和神奇的光环是该物品存在的唯一线索。以这种方式携带的物品被认为是与接受者相适应的，并被计入可以适应的物品数量的上限。如果该生物已经达到了极限，那么该咒语就无法生效。",
	"If absorb object is dispelled or otherwise ends early, the object tears itself free of its recipient, doing {@damage 2d8} piercing damage in the process. The original spell-caster can end the spell as an action, causing the item to be expelled harmlessly.": "如果吸收对象被驱散或提前结束，该对象会将自己从接受者身上撕开，在此过程中造成{@damage 2d8}穿刺伤害。原先的施法者可以作为一个动作结束该法术，使该物品无害地被排出。",
	"You cause liquids carried by a creature to dry up. All nonmagical liquid (water, alcohol, lamp oil) evaporates instantly unless the target creature makes a successful Wisdom saving throw. In addition, three potions carried by the target will also be affected by this spell. If the target carries more than three potions, the three that dry up are selected randomly.": "你会使生物携带的液体变干。所有非魔法液体（水、酒精、灯油）都会瞬间蒸发，除非目标生物成功地进行了智慧救赎。此外，目标携带的三瓶药水也会受到此法术的影响。如果目标携带的药水超过三瓶，会随机选择其中三瓶变干。",
	"Absorption has no direct effect on living (or unliving) creatures or plants, only on liquids they carry.": "吸收对生物（或非生物）或植物没有直接影响，只对它们携带的液体有影响。",
	"A blast of caustic acid erupts from your fingers. Every creature in the cone takes {@damage 6d8} acid damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail their saving throw also take an additional {@damage 2d8} acid damage at the end of their next turn.": "一股腐蚀性的酸液从你的手指中喷发出来。圆锥体中的每个生物都会受到{@damage 6d8}的酸液伤害，或者在灵巧救赎成功的情况下受到一半伤害。救赎失败的生物在下一回合结束时还会受到额外的{@damage 2d8}酸伤害。",
	"For each spell slot used higher than 6th level, the subsequent damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|6-9|1d8}.": "每使用一个高于6级的法术槽，后续的伤害会增加（%0%）。",
	"You create a caustic downpour of acid in a cylindrical area with a 20-foot radius, 30 feet high, extending downward from a point you can see. For the duration, each creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area takes {@damage 5d8} acid damage. Even after leaving the area, a creature is still coated with the acid and continues taking {@damage 2d8} acid damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature can use an action to rinse off the acid if it has water, vinegar, or another suitable substance available. All ongoing damage ends when the spell ends.": "你在一个半径为20英尺、高30英尺的圆柱形区域内制造出一股腐蚀性的酸液，从你能看到的地方向下延伸。在持续时间内，每个在该区域内开始行动或进入该区域的生物都会受到{@damage 5d8}酸液伤害。即使离开该区域，生物仍会被酸液覆盖，并在其每个回合结束时继续受到{@damage 2d8}酸液伤害。如果生物有水、醋或其他合适的物质，它可以使用行动来冲洗酸液。所有持续的伤害在法术结束时结束。",
	"The acid can also damage objects in the affected area, but the extent of this damage must be determined by the GM.": "酸液也可以损害受影响区域的物体，但这种损害的程度必须由GM决定。",
	"You transform a normal body of water into a pool of thick, bubbling acid. The spell affects an area up to 100 ft. by 100 feet by 20 feet deep. The acid is black and opaque and reeks of sulfur. Anyone splashed by the acid takes {@damage 2d6} acid damage. A creature that starts its turn in the acid or that enters the acid takes {@damage 10d6} acid damage, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.": "你将一个正常的水体变成一池浓稠的、冒泡的酸液。该法术影响的范围是100英尺乘100英尺乘20英尺深。酸液是黑色的、不透明的，散发着硫磺的气味。任何被酸液溅到的人都会受到（%0%）酸液伤害。在酸液中开始的生物或进入酸液中的生物会受到1%的酸液伤害，或在体质测试成功后受到一半的伤害。",
	"You call forth a breeze full of stinging acid droplets from your outstretched hand. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d6} acid damage and is {@condition blinded} until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded}.": "你从你伸出的手中召唤出一股充满刺痛的酸液。从你开始的15英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个 \"宪法救赎\"。拯救失败时，生物会受到{@damage 2d6}的酸液伤害，并被{@condition blinded}，直到你下一回合结束。拯救成功时，该生物会受到一半的伤害，并且不会受到（%2%）。",
	"For each spell slot used higher than 1st level, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|1-9|1d6}.": "每使用一个高于一级的法术槽，伤害增加（%0%）。",
	"As part of casting this spell, you throw up to six acorns, which take root and rapidly grow into adult trees where they land. The acorns can be thrown up to 60 feet. They can all be thrown in the same direction, or in different directions. They must land in fertile ground (not on bare rock or a wooden floor, for example) for the spell to be effective, and they must have enough space to grow. You have a special bond with this grove; it grants you tactical advantage on saving throws you make within 30 feet of one of the trees. This benefit ends if all of the trees are destroyed.": "作为施法的一部分，你最多可以抛出六个橡子，这些橡子会在它们落地的地方生根并迅速成长为成年树木。橡子可以被抛出60英尺。它们可以被抛向同一个方向，也可以抛向不同的方向。它们必须落在肥沃的土地上（例如，不能落在光秃秃的岩石或木地板上），咒语才会有效，而且它们必须有足够的空间来生长。你与这片树林有一种特殊的联系；它使你在其中一棵树的30英尺范围内进行拯救时获得战术优势。如果所有的树都被摧毁，这个好处就会终止。",
	"The trees shrink back into acorns when the spell ends.": "咒语结束后，树木会缩回成橡子。",
	"One skeleton that you touch gains immunity to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from nonmagical weapons that are not made of adamantine, and resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from magical weapons that are not made of adamantine.": "你接触的一个骷髅获得对非金刚砂制成的非魔法武器的打击、砍击和穿刺伤害的免疫，以及对非金刚砂制成的魔法武器的打击、砍击和穿刺伤害的抵抗。",
	"For each spell slot used higher than 6th level, you can affect one additional skeleton.": "每使用一个高于6级的法术槽，你可以影响一个额外的骷髅。",
	"You touch a creature, and that creature becomes cursed with age unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. The creature becomes wizened and enfeebled and has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution-based ability checks, attack rolls, skill rolls, and saving throws. It does half damage with weapon attacks.": "你触碰一个生物，那个生物就会受到年龄的诅咒，除非它能成功地做一个宪法救赎动作。该生物会变得虚弱无力，并在力量、灵巧和基于宪法的能力检查、攻击卷、技能卷和蓄力投掷中处于劣势。它的武器攻击伤害减半。",
	"This effect can be ended by magic that removes curses.": "这个效果可以通过消除诅咒的魔法来结束。",
	"You summon an {@condition invisible} creature capable of steering and navigating any vessel competently. It follows simple instructions you give it regarding the bearing and speed of the vessel. Treat the creature as if it had a +6 bonus to relevant ability checks when performing its duties.": "你召唤出一个能够胜任驾驶和导航任何船只的（%0%）生物。它遵循你给它的关于船只方位和速度的简单指令。在履行其职责时，将该生物视为对相关能力检查有+6的奖励。",
	"The creature has AC 10, 1 hit point, Strength 10, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.": "该生物有AC10，1个命中率，力量10，并且不能攻击。如果它的命中率降至0，则咒语结束。",
	"You conjure an aetheric lens, 10 feet wide, within 30 feet of you. The lens protects those behind it from magic; any spell of 4th level or lower that requires a clear path through the lens is stopped entirely. The lens doesn't interfere with spells you cast, and it doesn't block area effects. For example, a fireball couldn't be aimed directly through the lens, but if it was set off immediately in front of the lens, the blast would still affect people on the other side of the lens and within the fireball's radius. You can spend a bonus action to move the lens to any point within 30 feet of you.": "你在30英尺范围内召唤出一个10英尺宽的乙太透镜。这个透镜可以保护它后面的人免受魔法侵害；任何需要通过透镜的清晰路径的四级或更低级的法术都会被完全阻止。透镜不会干扰你施展的法术，也不会阻挡区域效果。例如，一个火球不能直接穿过透镜，但如果它在透镜前面被引爆，爆炸仍会影响到透镜另一边和火球半径内的人。你可以花一个额外的动作将镜头移动到你30英尺内的任何地方。",
	"If aetheric shield is cast using a spell slot higher than 4th level, the lens protects against spells of equal or lower level than the spell slot you used.": "如果使用高于4级的法术槽施放乙太护盾，那么透镜可以防止与你使用的法术槽等级相同或更低的法术。",
	"You can manipulate a normal fog bank of up to 1,000 cubic feet you can see within range. The fog can be gathered into a thick mass of opaque fog, creating a heavily obscured area, or dispersed to create an area of patchy fog that lightly obscures its area. Magically-created fog can't be affected by this spell.": "你可以操纵一个普通的雾库，其容积可达1,000立方英尺，你可以在范围内看到。这些雾可以聚集成厚厚的不透明的雾，形成一个严重遮蔽的区域，也可以分散开来，形成一个轻度遮蔽其区域的斑驳的雾的区域。魔法创造的雾气不能被这个法术影响。",
	"This spell enables you to sway a large group of people toward accomplishing a specific goal. You must speak emphatically on the subject for 10 minutes, playing on the crowd's emotions and reason, to inflame their fervor for or against a cause or person. You must be clear about the specific goal you want to achieve. For example, shouting that \"The Academy of Wizards is evil and corrupt!\" might make people dislike the academy, but it won't spur them to action because it doesn't tell them what to do. Adding \"Follow me, and we'll burn it to the ground!\" will send a crowd of torch-bearing arsonists to the academy tower.": "这个咒语使你能动摇一大群人去完成一个特定的目标。你必须就这一主题强调10分钟，利用众人的情感和理智，激发他们对某一事业或个人的狂热或反对。你必须清楚地说明你要实现的具体目标。例如，大喊 \"巫师学院是邪恶和腐败的！\"可能会让人们不喜欢这个学院，但这不会刺激他们采取行动，因为它没有告诉他们该怎么做。加上 \"跟着我，我们要把它烧成灰烬！\"会让一群举着火把的纵火犯来到学院的塔楼上。",
	"The spell affects all sentient creatures that are able to hear and understand you within 60 feet.": "该法术影响到60英尺内所有能够听到并理解你的有生命的生物。",
	"When you finish casting the spell, all potential targets of the spell who fail a Wisdom saving throw are compelled to follow your instructions for the duration of the spell, as long as those orders are in keeping with the goal stated in the speech and you personally lead them. If these conditions aren't met, the spell ends and the crowd becomes hostile toward you. The spell also ends when the goal has been achieved.": "当你完成施法时，所有潜在的法术目标，如果智慧救赎失败，就会被强迫在法术的持续时间内听从你的指示，只要这些命令符合演讲中所说的目标，并且你亲自领导他们。如果这些条件没有得到满足，咒语就会结束，人群会对你产生敌意。咒语也会在目标实现后结束。",
	"You grant up to ten willing creatures you can see the ability to breathe air until the spell ends. These creatures retain the ability to breathe in their normal element.": "你赋予最多十个你能看到的自愿生物呼吸空气的能力，直到法术结束。这些生物保留在其正常元素中呼吸的能力。",
	"You create an invisible bridge up to 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that connects two points of your choosing. Both ends of the bridge must be within the spell's range, and both must be solid objects that can support the weight of whatever physical objects cross the bridge. The bridge itself has no weight. Anyone can cross this bridge while it exists, provided they know where it is.": "你创造一座长60英尺、宽10英尺的隐形桥，连接你选择的两点。桥的两端都必须在法术的范围内，而且都必须是坚固的物体，可以支撑过桥的任何物理物体的重量。桥本身没有重量。只要知道桥的位置，任何人都可以在桥存在的时候穿过它。",
	"When you cast air bridge using a slot of 5th level or higher, the bridge is substantial only to those you nominate; to all others, it does not exist. This is also true if you cast the spell as a ritual and are capable of casting 5th level spells.": "当你使用5级或更高等级的槽施放空气桥时，该桥只对你提名的人有实质意义；对所有其他人，它不存在。如果你以仪式的方式施法，并且有能力施展五级法术，这也是真的。",
	"You heat a patch of air to the great temperatures of a forge. You can hold up metal to that area and soften it just as a real forge would and then work the metal appropriately. Only items placed in the heated area by the caster are affected; the heat doesn't affect anything else, and it can't be felt by living creatures at all. This spell, along with a portable anvil, greatly lessens the difficulty for a craftsman repairing equipment in the field.": "你把一片空气加热到锻炉的巨大温度。你可以将金属举到该区域，并使其软化，就像真正的锻炉一样，然后适当地加工金属。只有被施法者放置在加热区域的物品才会受到影响；热量不会影响其他东西，而且生物根本无法感受到它。这个法术和一个便携式铁砧一起，大大降低了工匠在野外修理设备的难度。",
	"If air forge is cast using a spell slot higher than 2nd level, it heats a number of cubic feet of air equal to the spell slot used.": "如果使用高于2级的法术槽施展空气锻造术，它会加热与所使用的法术槽相等的立方英尺的空气。",
	"The spell creates a 5-foot-radius sphere of pure, fresh air that forms around you and moves with you. The spell keeps out hazardous gases and water, but solid objects can pass into the sphere. The air remains pure and clean for the duration of the spell.": "该法术创造一个半径为5英尺的纯净、新鲜空气的球体，在你周围形成并随你移动。该法术可以阻止有害气体和水，但固体物体可以进入球体。空气在法术持续期间保持纯净和清洁。",
	"A willing creature gains an aura of nobility, which gives it tactical advantage on Charisma ability checks made to influence others.": "一个有意愿的生物会获得一个高贵的光环，这使它在影响他人的魅力能力检查中获得战术优势。",
	"You cause an existing fire of Medium or smaller size to reduce in size and light to that of a match, or increase in brightness—but not size—to that of a light spell. Reducing a fire also reduces its consumption of fuel by half, with the effect of doubling its remaining duration, while increasing a fire doubles its fuel consumption. This spell doesn't change the heat output of the fire.": "你使一个现有的中等或较小的火在体积和亮度上缩小到火柴的大小，或者在亮度上增加--但不是在体积上--到一个照明法术的大小。缩小火的同时也将其消耗的燃料减少一半，效果是将其剩余的持续时间翻倍，而增加火的效果是将其燃料消耗翻倍。这个咒语并不改变火的热量输出。",
	"This spell changes the target's scent to any other of the caster's choice. Creatures attempting to track the target by scent have tactical disadvantage on ability checks to follow the target.": "此法术将目标的气味改变为施法者所选择的任何其他气味。试图通过气味追踪目标的生物在跟随目标的能力检查上有战术上的劣势。",
	"You create an anchor and chain of pure force that attach to a ship and maintain its position against current and strong wind. Creatures aboard the ship can raise the anchor by using an action to touch the chain and command it, and they can lower the anchor the same way. The anchor disappears when the spell ends.": "你创造了一个纯力量的锚和链子，它附着在船上，并在水流和强风中保持其位置。船上的生物可以通过使用一个动作来触碰链条并命令它提高锚，他们也可以用同样的方法降低锚。咒语结束后，锚会消失。",
	"One willing creature you touch is blessed with the protective qualities of angels. For the duration of the spell, the target creature gains resistance to radiant damage and to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It also has tactical advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "你接触的一个自愿的生物受到天使的保护品质的祝福。在咒语的持续时间内，目标生物获得对辐射伤害和非魔法的击打、穿刺和切割伤害的抵抗。它在对法术和其他魔法效果的救赎上也有战术优势。",
	"This spell allows you and up to three more willing creatures to take on the appearance of any one species of beast of CR 1 or less, but only to members of that species. All creatures of that species perceive affected creatures not only as their own kind but also as members of their own pack, herd, flock, or group. The spell does not guarantee safety; affected creatures might still be challenged as rivals for mates or dominance, but such challenges are no more severe than they would be for a genuine rival beast.": "这个法术允许你和最多三个愿意的生物变成任何一种CR1或更小的野兽的样子，但只对该物种的成员。该物种的所有生物不仅将受影响的生物视为自己的同类，还将其视为自己的族群、畜群、羊群或团体的成员。该法术并不保证安全；受影响的生物仍然可能会被挑战为配偶或统治权的对手，但这种挑战不会比真正的对手兽更严重。",
	"This spell unleashes magic that rips the soul from a living creature you can see. The target takes {@damage 8d6 + 50} necrotic damage, or half damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw.": "这个咒语会释放魔法，从你能看到的活物身上撕下灵魂。目标会受到0%的坏死伤害，如果它能成功地进行体质测试，则会受到一半的伤害。",
	"If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points after failing the saving throw against this spell, it dies and its soul shatters into {@dice 2d6} spirit shards that take up residence in random life forms in a 10-mile radius. The spirit shards prefer intelligent creatures over unintelligent ones. The creatures that become hosts to these shards are unaware of their presence, but they can start having strange dreams and displaying odd habits picked up from the soul shard. Each shard-bearer also gains proficiency in one random skill possessed by the original creature; if they already are proficient in the skill, they become expert in the skill, and if already expert, they gain tactical advantage on all uses of that skill.": "如果该生物在对该咒语的救赎失败后被降低到0点，它就会死亡，其灵魂会破碎成{@dice 2d6}精神碎片，在方圆10英里的随机生命体中居住。灵魂碎片更喜欢有智慧的生物而不是无智慧的生物。成为这些碎片宿主的生物并不知道它们的存在，但它们会开始做一些奇怪的梦，并表现出从灵魂碎片中获得的奇怪的习惯。每个拥有碎片的人也会获得原始生物所拥有的一个随机技能的熟练度；如果他们已经精通该技能，他们会成为该技能的专家，如果已经是专家，他们会在该技能的所有使用中获得战术优势。",
	"The original creature can't be resurrected unless all bearers of shards are gathered into the same area before the resurrection magic is used; shard-bearers lose all benefits gained from the spirit shards at that time.": "除非在使用复活魔法之前，所有的碎片携带者都聚集到同一区域，否则原始生物无法复活；碎片携带者在那个时候会失去从精神碎片获得的所有好处。",
	"If a shard-bearer dies, the spirit shard transfers to another creature within 10 miles.": "如果持有碎片的人死亡，精神碎片会转移到10英里内的另一个生物身上。",
	"You point at a creature and disrupt the aether around it. For the duration of arcane censure, the creature can't cast spells or use innate spellcasting. As an action, it can make an ability check using its spellcasting ability against your spell saving throw DC. A successful save ends the arcane censure's effect.": "你指向一个生物，扰乱它周围的乙太。在奥术指责的持续时间内，该生物不能施展法术或使用先天法术。作为一个行动，它可以使用它的法术能力对你的法术蓄力DC进行能力检查。拯救成功后，奥术指责的效果就会结束。",
	"You create an aura in a 50-foot radius around yourself that is antithetical to arcane magic. Arcane spellcasters in the sphere require additional time to cast their spells: spells that take a bonus action to cast now require 1 action; 1 action increases to 1 round; and other spells have their casting times doubled. The sphere of effect moves with you.": "你在自己周围50英尺的范围内创造一个与奥术魔法相反的光环。范围内的奥术施法者需要额外的时间来施展他们的法术：需要额外行动才能施展的法术现在需要1个行动；1个行动增加到1轮；其他法术的施展时间翻倍。效果范围随你移动。",
	"You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of unstable magic centered on a point you can see. For the duration of the spell, any creature casting an arcane spell within the area of the sphere takes {@damage 6d6} fire damage, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw, as their casting ignites the magic of your spell.": "你以你能看到的一个点为中心，创造一个半径为30英尺的不稳定魔法球。在咒语的持续时间内，任何在球体范围内施展奥术咒语的生物都会受到{@damage 6d6}的火焰伤害，或者在宪法救赎成功的情况下受到一半的伤害，因为他们的施法会点燃你的咒语的魔法。",
	"You summon power to protect yourself against outside magic. You get tactical advantage on saving throws against magic that specifically targets you. Arcane shield provides no protection against area-effect spells.": "你召唤力量来保护自己免受外界魔法的伤害。在面对专门针对你的魔法时，你会获得战术优势。奥术盾牌不提供对区域效应法术的保护。",
	"You hurl a spear made of magical force at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it hits, the spear does {@damage 3d10} force damage. If the target is a spellcaster, the hit also wipes out one of its available, lowest-level spell slots as if the spell had been expended.": "你向范围内的一个生物投掷由魔法力量构成的长矛。对目标进行一次远程法术攻击。如果命中，长矛会造成{@damage 3d10}力量伤害。如果目标是一个施法者，被击中后也会消灭其一个可用的、最低等级的法术槽，就像该法术被消耗了一样。",
	"For each spell slot used higher than 3rd level, damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d10|3-9|1d10}. When you cast arcane spear using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, a hit also wipes out two of the target's spell slots instead of one.": "每使用一个高于3级的法术槽，伤害就增加（%0%）。当你使用6级以上的法术槽施放奥术之矛时，命中后也会消灭目标的两个法术槽，而不是一个。",
	"You scribe a tattoo on a willing creature's skin that holds a portion of an animal's energy and ability. A creature can only hold one aspect tattoo at a time; scribing another eliminates the previous one. The animal being represented must be present when the aspect tattoo is created.": "你在一个愿意的生物的皮肤上刻画一个纹身，这个纹身拥有动物的一部分能量和能力。一个生物一次只能持有一个方面的纹身；刻画另一个纹身会消除之前的纹身。在创造方面的刺青时，被代表的动物必须在场。",
	"The recipient of the tattoo can activate the tattoo's effect as a bonus action. Once the tattoo is scribed, it remains until the effect is activated.": "纹身的接受者可以将纹身的效果作为一个额外动作来激活。一旦纹身被刻画出来，它就会一直存在，直到效果被激活。",

	" The recipient gains tactical advantage on Stealth checks for 10 minutes.": " 接受者在10分钟内获得隐身检查的战术优势。",
	"Other animal tattoos could be discovered that grant different powers.": "可以发现其他动物纹身，赋予不同的力量。",
	"A coin that you received in payment becomes imbued with a magical charm. Once the spell is cast, you must return the coin to the person or being who gave it to you. As an action, they can throw the coin into the air while speaking your name (or whatever name you gave them). The coin then vanishes and reappears in your pocket, along with a mental image of whoever spoke your name. No message can be transferred along with the coin.": "你收到的付款硬币会被灌注一种神奇的魅力。一旦施法，你必须把硬币还给给你的人或生物。作为一个行动，他们可以在说出你的名字（或你给他们的任何名字）的同时将硬币抛向空中。硬币会消失并重新出现在你的口袋里，同时还有一个说出你名字的人的精神影像。硬币上没有任何信息可以被传递。",
	"When cast upon a creature killed by you within one minute of its death, assassin's mark reshapes the fatal wound in a way that unmistakably identifies you as the killer. You select the form this mark will take when you learn the spell, and you can't change it later except through exceptional magic such as a wish spell. No two creatures can share the same assassin's mark.": "当对被你杀死的生物在其死亡后一分钟内施放时，刺客的标记会以一种明确无误的方式重塑其致命的伤口，从而确认你是凶手。你在学习这个咒语时选择了这个标记的形式，除非通过特殊的魔法如愿望咒语，否则你以后无法改变它。没有两个生物可以共享同一个刺客标记。",
	"When you cast this spell, rocks, boulders, and other large stones are summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth and rain down on the area of effect, which can be up to 1,200 square feet (twelve 10-by-10-foot squares). The area can be laid out as you wish, but it must be contiguous, at least 10 feet across at every point, entirely within the spell's range, and entirely within your line of sight.": "当你施展这个法术时，岩石、巨石和其他大石头会从土元素界被召唤出来，并在效果区下起雨来，效果区可以达到1200平方英尺（12个10乘10平方英尺的方块）。这个区域可以按照你的意愿布置，但它必须是连续的，每一点都至少有10英尺宽，完全在咒语的范围内，并且完全在你的视线范围内。",
	"Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature takes {@damage 8d8} bludgeoning damage, falls {@condition prone}, and is {@condition restrained} beneath boulders until they escape or the stones disappear. A successful save means the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone} or {@condition restrained}. A {@condition restrained} creature can escape from under the boulders by using an action and making a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell saving throw DC.": "该区域内的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，该生物会受到{@damage 8d8}重击伤害，跌落{@condition prone}，并被{@condition restrained}压在巨石下，直到他们逃脱或石头消失。拯救成功意味着该生物受到一半的伤害，并且不会被击倒（%3%）或（%4%）。一个{@condition restrained}的生物可以从巨石下逃脱，只要使用一个动作，并对你的法术蓄力DC进行成功的力量（竞技）检查。",

	"You select an animal (for example, a lion) or image (such as a shining sword) or ideal (such as honor) and associate it with a specific individual. Each creature within the spell's range must make a Wisdom saving throw. Each creature that fails the saving throw associates the person with the animal, image, or ideal for as long as the spell lasts. A positive association increases the starting attitude of those around the affected target by one step; hostile becomes indifferent, indifferent becomes friendly. Likewise, a negative association decreases the starting attitude by one.": "你选择一种动物（例如狮子）或图像（例如一把闪亮的剑）或理想（例如荣誉），并将其与特定的个人联系起来。咒语范围内的每个生物都必须做一个智慧救赎动作。每一个失败的生物都会将这个人与动物、形象或理想联系起来，直到咒语持续为止。一个积极的联想会使受影响目标周围的人的起始态度提高一步；敌意变成冷漠，冷漠变成友好。同样地，负面的联想会使起始态度减少一步。",

For example, if a lady sees someone running from her husband's room with a dagger, this spell compels her to forget that image. But if the person with the dagger is still visible a second later, she'll wonder about it all over again. Similarly, an opponent in combat can forget what strike he was planning but still realizes he's in combat and attack on his next action.

Climbing still costs double normal movement.": "你使你的部分皮肤渗出一种粘稠的树液，使你能够附着在木质表面。你可以随心所欲地改变哪些部位会流出树液。这使你可以在木质表面上攀爬或栖息，而不会掉下来。攀爬仍然需要花费双倍的正常移动。",
	"One weapon you can see that deals slashing damage becomes incredibly sharp.

	"This is a subtle effect calling for adjudication by the GM. The affected creature doesn't go berserk or turn into a serial murderer. Most often, this spell causes the affected creature's normal acts to become twisted perversions of their original intent. For example, a noble knight afflicted by the chill of evil might decide that defeating his opponent honorably on the field of battle isn't enough \"justice\" for the harm that opponent caused. Instead, that foe must be \"purified\" through pain, so the knight imprisons him and tortures him to death over the week of the spell's duration. An artist could turn to portraying only evil or grisly subjects in his paintings, and a merchant might suddenly start hawking poisons on the street. Essentially, the affected creature acts as if its alignment is aggressively Neutral Evil; it greedily seeks its own interests with no regard for how others are hurt. If the creature was Evil to begin with, this might not be much of a change.": "这是一个微妙的效果，需要由GM来裁决。受影响的生物不会发狂或变成一个连环杀手。最常见的是，这个咒语会使受影响的生物的正常行为变成对其原意的扭曲变态。例如，一个受邪恶之寒影响的贵族骑士可能会决定，在战场上光荣地击败他的对手并不足以为该对手造成的伤害 \"伸张正义\"。相反，必须通过痛苦来 \"净化 \"这个敌人，所以骑士把他囚禁起来，在咒语持续的一周内把他折磨致死。一个艺术家可以在他的画中只描绘邪恶或可怕的主题，一个商人可能突然开始在街上兜售毒药。从本质上讲，受影响的生物的行为就像它的排列方式是积极的中性邪恶；它贪婪地寻求自己的利益，而不考虑其他人受到的伤害。如果该生物一开始就是邪恶的，这可能不会有什么变化。",

Their victims are likely to fall from grace for the duration of the spell at least, and their reputations might be ruined for far longer. The target of the spell recalls everything after it ends. Since the person doesn't necessarily know they were enchanted, a Good character is likely to feel tremendous remorse over his or her actions.": "邪恶之寒最常被邪恶的神职人员用来对付圣骑士和善良的神职人员。他们的受害者至少在咒语的持续时间内可能会从容不迫，而他们的名誉可能会被毁得更久。咒语的目标在咒语结束后会回忆起一切。因为这个人不一定知道他们被施了魔法，所以一个善良的角色很可能对他或她的行为感到极大的悔恨。",
	"Your eyes become cold and frosty. For the duration of this spell, whenever a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of you, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature must be able to see your eyes, and you must be able to see it. If the saving throw fails, the creature takes {@damage 2d10} cold damage and becomes paralyzed by supernatural chills.

	"The spell's magic is erratic. Each day, there is a 5% chance that time slows for the creature for 24 hours, causing the creature to act as if under the influence of a slow spell for the entire day. In addition, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw against any magic involving time or aging during that 24-hour period.": "该咒语的魔力是不稳定的。每天，有5%的几率使该生物的时间变慢24小时，导致该生物在一整天内的行为就像被一个缓慢的咒语所影响。此外，该生物在该24小时内对任何涉及时间或衰老的魔法的救赎都有劣势。",
	"A willing creature you touch becomes wrapped in a silky cocoon. While in the cocoon, the subject doesn't need to eat or drink. At the end of the hour, it emerges from the cocoon as if it had just completed a long rest. While within the cocoon, however, the creature is helpless and can do nothing. If awakened before the end of the spell's duration, the subject can break free from the cocoon as an action, but this does provoke opportunity attacks from adjacent enemies. The creature has tactical disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while cocooned.": "你触摸到的一个自愿的生物会被包裹在一个丝质的茧中。在茧中时，受试者不需要吃喝。一小时后，它从茧中出来，好像刚刚完成了一次长时间的休息。然而，在茧内时，该生物是无助的，什么也做不了。如果在法术持续时间结束前被唤醒，该生物可以作为一个动作从茧中挣脱出来，但这将引起邻近敌人的机会攻击。在作茧自缚的情况下，该生物在智慧（感知）检查方面有战术上的劣势。",

	"You empower a magic circle that links to sigils of seeing you previously created. You can select a number of sigils up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

If a cold-based spell or effect is used on an area soaked by cloud burst (such as a cone of cold cast on rain-soaked ground), normal ice is formed. Such ice remains for the duration of this spell if the temperature is below 32° F; otherwise the ice melts normally when the temperature rises above freezing.": "如果云爆对大型或更大的火源（如火墙）施放，或在云爆区域内施放魔法热量或火焰（如火球或火焰攻击），则会有一团温暖的雾气（视同雾云法术）在效果区域内流动，持续3回合。如果在被云雾爆裂浸泡的区域使用基于寒冷的法术或效果（例如在被雨水浸泡的地面上施放寒冷之锥），则会形成普通的冰。如果温度低于32°F，这种冰会在此法术的持续时间内保持不变；否则当温度上升到冰点以上时，冰会正常融化。",
	"You create a cloud of icy fog in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see. The sphere extends around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The fog is semi-solid, and its area is considered difficult terrain.": "你在一个以你能看到的点为中心的20英尺半径的球体中制造一团冰雾。该球体在角落里延伸，其区域被严重遮蔽。雾是半固态的，其区域被认为是困难地形。",
	"Each creature that starts its turn in the fog, or enters it, takes {@damage 4d6} cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its turn.": "每个在雾中开始其回合的生物，或进入雾中的生物，都会受到{@damage 4d6}寒冷伤害，其速度降低10英尺，直到其回合结束。",
	"The fog lasts for the duration of the spell or until it's dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 mph).": "雾气持续到咒语的持续时间，或者直到它被中等或更高速度的风（至少10英里/小时）吹散。",
	"You gain a limited form of telepathy that enables you to anticipate the moves of your opponents in combat. This grants you a +2 armor class bonus against melee attacks and a +3 armor class bonus against ranged attacks. The spell doesn't work against attackers that have no minds (automatons, mindless undead) or whose thoughts are shielded.": "你获得了一种有限的心灵感应，使你能在战斗中预知对手的动作。这使你在面对近战攻击时获得+2的装甲等级加成，在面对远程攻击时获得+3的装甲等级加成。该法术对没有思想的攻击者（自动机、无意识的亡灵）或思想被屏蔽的攻击者不起作用。",
	"You attempt to contact the spirit of a specific dead entity by name. The spell contacts the spirit and lets it know that you want to meet; it doesn't compel the spirit to appear before you. This spell is most useful in the Underworld or another realm where finding one shade among countless hosts of the dead can be nigh impossible. The spell conveys your call to the shade you desire, along with your location and a sense of urgency. The shade is under no obligation to respond, but most do simply to break the eternal tedium of death. If the shade chooses to answer your call in the Underworld, it arrives within ten minutes. If you are somewhere else, the shade arrives within 24 hours.": "你试图通过名字来联系某个特定的死亡实体的灵魂。咒语会联系到灵魂，让它知道你想见面；但它不会强迫灵魂出现在你面前。这个咒语在冥界或其他领域最有用，因为在那里从无数的死人中找到一个阴魂几乎是不可能的。咒语将你的召唤传达给你想要的阴魂，以及你的位置和紧迫感。阴阳人没有义务回应，但大多数人只是为了打破死亡的永恒乏味。如果阴阳师选择在冥界回应你的召唤，它会在10分钟内到达。如果你在其他地方，阴阳师会在24小时内到达。",
	"If cast within the Underworld, the spell's range is unlimited. If cast from the material world or any other plane, the site of the spirit's death must be on the same plane and within the spell's range of the caster. Note that the range refers to the site of the creature's death, not its current location.": "如果在冥界内施展，咒语的范围是无限的。如果从物质世界或任何其他位面施放，灵魂的死亡地点必须在同一位面，并且在施法者的法术范围内。注意，这个范围是指生物死亡的地点，而不是它目前的位置。",
	"This spell can also be used to contact an intelligent undead creature within range; for example, it could contact the spirit of a drowned sailor if cast within a mile of the site of the drowning.": "这个法术也可以用来联系范围内的智慧不死生物；例如，如果在溺水地点一英里内施法，它可以联系溺水者的灵魂。",
	"Note that this spell does not alter the subject's personality or willingness to help you. Once the target spirit arrives, you must persuade it to help through negotiation, payment, or coercion of some sort. Family members, loved ones, friends, and slain companions are more inclined to help than are strangers or someone who was killed by the caster. Another spell, such as speak with dead, might be needed to compel answers from an uncooperative or unresponsive shade.": "注意，这个咒语不会改变对象的个性或帮助你的意愿。一旦目标灵魂到达，你必须通过谈判、付款或某种胁迫来说服它帮忙。与陌生人或被施法者杀死的人相比，家人、爱人、朋友和被杀的同伴更倾向于提供帮助。可能需要另一个法术，比如与死人对话，来迫使不合作或无反应的阴魂回答。",
	"You create a bond between up to four willing creatures you can see. All must be within 30 feet of you. For the duration of the spell, a creature may, as a bonus action, transfer any number of its hit points to another creature affected by the spell. Any hit points that would raise a creature over its maximum number of hit points are gained as temporary hit points. Temporary hit points gained through this spell vanish when the spell ends, but other hit point changes are permanent.": "你在你能看到的最多四个自愿的生物之间建立一种联系。所有人都必须在你的30英尺范围内。在咒语的持续时间内，一个生物可以作为额外行动，将其任何数量的命中率转移到另一个受咒语影响的生物。任何会使生物的命中率超过其最大命中率的命中点都作为临时命中率获得。通过这个法术获得的临时命中率在法术结束时消失，但其他的命中率变化是永久性的。",
	"You create a 60-foot-long cone originating from your hand. All unattended, nonliving, organic matter within the cone crumbles to dust. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, all the creature's nonmagical, organic gear (food, drink, cloth, leather, etc.) is destroyed.": "你创造了一个60英尺长的圆锥体，从你的手中发出。锥体内所有无人看管的、非生命的、有机的物质都会碎裂成灰尘。锥体中的每个生物都必须做一个 \"宪法保护\"。如果蓄力失败，该生物的所有非魔法的有机装备（食物、饮料、布、皮革等）都会被摧毁。",

	"You create an aura of silence in a 20-foot-radius sphere around yourself that moves with you. Within the aura, only you can make noise; all other noises are silenced. In addition, no creature inside the affected area can take thunder damage or be affected by sound-related spells unless the spell was cast by you.": "你在自己周围20英尺半径的范围内创造一个沉默的光环，这个光环会随着你移动。在这个光环内，只有你能发出声音，其他所有的声音都被压制。此外，受影响区域内的任何生物都不能受到雷霆伤害或受到与声音有关的法术影响，除非该法术是由你施放的。",
	"You point at a creature within range and mentally command it to burst into flame. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, it takes {@damage 6d10 + 20} fire damage and begins burning; on a successful save, it takes half damage and suffers no other effect.": "你指着范围内的一个生物，在精神上命令它迸发火焰。该生物必须做一个灵巧的拯救动作。如果蓄力失败，它将受到{@damage 6d10 + 20}的火焰伤害并开始燃烧；如果蓄力成功，它将受到一半的伤害，并且不会受到其他影响。",
	"A burning creature takes {@damage 2d10} fire damage at the end of each of its turns. The fire can't be extinguished by natural means; it burns for the duration of the spell.": "燃烧的生物在其每个回合结束时受到{@damage 2d10}的火焰伤害。火焰不能用自然方法熄灭；它在法术的持续时间内燃烧。",
	"Every intelligent creature within 60 feet of yourself (including you) takes on the appearance of one other creature in the area. The creature that everyone and everything resembles should be selected randomly. Every creature in the area of effect becomes an exact copy of the original, from the items it carries to the sound of its voice.": "在你周围60英尺范围内的每个智慧生物（包括你）都会呈现出该地区其他一个生物的样子。每个人和所有东西都像的那个生物应该是随机选择的。效应区域内的每一个生物都会变成原始生物的精确拷贝，从它携带的物品到它的声音。",
	"A creature that sees the spell's effect can make an Intelligence saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature can't distinguish which creature is which by sight or sound. On a successful save, the creature still sees the illusion but can tell which creature is which from subtle clues such as posture or manner of movement.": "看到咒语效果的生物可以做一个智力储蓄动作。如果蓄力失败，该生物无法通过视觉或听觉来区分哪个生物是哪个。如果救赎成功，该生物仍能看到幻觉，但可以从姿势或运动方式等细微的线索中分辨出哪个生物是哪种生物。",
	"As an action, a creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell saving throw DC; if it succeeds, they can correctly identify each creature affected by the illusion, the same as if they'd made a successful saving throw.": "作为一个行动，一个生物可以对你的法术蓄力DC进行智力（调查）检查；如果成功，他们可以正确识别每个受幻觉影响的生物，就像他们成功蓄力一样。",
	"You enchant a rock so that it warms with some of the heat from its creation. The rock glows red-hot and radiates enough heat to warm a normal-sized room or a small cave to 70 degrees. The rock must weigh at least 10 pounds. Anyone who touches the rock directly takes {@damage 1d6} fire damage.": "你对一块石头施展魔法，使其在创造时产生的一些热量使其变暖。这块石头会发出红光，并放射出足够的热量，使一个正常大小的房间或一个小山洞温暖到70度。这块石头必须至少有10磅重。任何直接接触岩石的人都会受到（%0%）的火焰伤害。",
	"You are surrounded by three small orbs of multicolored force that can absorb certain spells. When you cast containment orbs, you choose a school of magic for each orb (e.g., abjuration, evocation, transmutation). Any spells of the appropriate type that would affect you are absorbed by the corresponding orb and have no further effect.": "你周围有三个多色力量的小球，可以吸收某些法术。当你施展遏制球时，你为每个球体选择一个魔法流派（例如：咒语、唤醒、转化）。任何会影响你的相应类型的法术都会被相应的球体吸收，并且没有进一步的效果。",
	"Each orb can absorb only one spell. Once an orb has absorbed a spell, you can use an action to cause it to explode. All creatures within 20 feet of you take {@damage 2d6} damage per level of the spell the orb absorbed, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. The DC for the saving throw is set by you, not by the spell's original caster.": "每个球体只能吸收一个法术。一旦球体吸收了一个法术，你可以使用一个动作使它爆炸。在你周围20英尺内的所有生物都会受到该球体所吸收的咒语每级百分之0%的伤害，或者在灵巧救赎成功后受到一半伤害。蓄力的DC由你设定，而不是由原来的施法者设定。",

Magical writing, including spellbook pages, can't be copied with this spell.": "这个法术可以将你接触到的任何书面或绘画文件完美复制到你提供的空白页上。你可以通过一次施法复制多达10页的文字。魔法文字，包括魔法书的书页，不能用这个法术来复制。",
	"You create magical armor from the remains of a dead humanoid that is the same size as you or larger. You touch the corpse, which then bends and twists itself around you to form a gruesome suit of armor from bones and dead flesh. Treat the armor as half-plate +1 (AC 16). You take normal penalties for wearing corpse armor if you aren't proficient with medium armor.": "你用与你体型相同或更大的人形尸体的残骸制造魔法盔甲。你触碰尸体，它就会在你周围弯曲和扭曲，用骨头和死肉形成一套可怕的盔甲。将该盔甲视为半身甲+1（AC 16）。如果你不精通中型盔甲，你穿戴尸体盔甲会受到正常的惩罚。",

	"You curse one creature you can see. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against the curse. If the saving throw fails, the target creature bloats into a horrific mockery of itself. Nonmagical belts, buckles, armor, clothes, shoes, and other garments are all destroyed by rapidly expanding rolls of flesh. The now-obese victim quadruples in weight and girth, loses 4 points of Strength and 6 points of Dexterity, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. Each month, it loses an additional point of Constitution. Ability scores can't be reduced below 1 by this spell.": "你诅咒一个你能看到的生物。该生物必须对该诅咒进行一次宪法救赎。如果蓄力失败，目标生物就会膨胀成一个可怕的怪物。非魔法腰带、扣子、盔甲、衣服、鞋子和其他服装都会被迅速膨胀的肉卷所破坏。现在肥胖的受害者的体重和腰围增加了四倍，失去了4点力量和6点灵巧，其速度减少了10英尺。每个月，它还会失去一点体质。能力值不能被这个法术降低到1以下。",
	"The creature returns to its previous size instantly if the curse is lifted by magic.": "如果诅咒被魔法解除，该生物会立即恢复到以前的大小。",
	"You change an area of water you can see into a poisonous, toxic substance. The spell affects a maximum of 10,000 cubic feet of water (picture ten cubes, each 10 feet on a side). Each creature that begins its turn in the water or that enters the water takes {@damage 5d6} poison damage and becomes {@condition poisoned} for as long as it stays in the corrupt water; a successful Constitution saving throw negates the effect on that creature. If the affected area is part of a larger body of water, new water entering the area becomes poisonous while water leaving the area is no longer affected.": "你将一个你能看到的水的区域变成有毒的、有毒性的物质。该法术最多影响10,000立方英尺的水（图中有10个立方体，每边10英尺）。每个在水中开始的生物或进入水中的生物都会受到{@damage 5d6}的毒害，只要它在腐败的水中停留，就会变成{@condition poisoned}；如果宪法救赎成功，就会否定对该生物的影响。如果受影响的区域是一个更大的水体的一部分，进入该区域的新水会变得有毒，而离开该区域的水则不再受影响。",
	"You transform nearby rocks and stones into an animated stone figure that fights for you. The objects don't need to be in humanoid form beforehand; they are magically shaped by the spell as if a master sculptor had carved them into a great statue.": "你把附近的岩石和石头变成一个为你而战的动画石像。这些物体不需要事先形成人形；它们被咒语神奇地塑造出来，就像一个雕塑大师把它们雕刻成一个伟大的雕像。",

	"You create a field of malign, chaotic energy adjacent to you and choose a creature you can see to be its target. The field is a 5-foot cube that appears adjacent to you. At the end of each of your turns, the cube moves 30 feet toward its target along the shortest path. The field can fly and can pass through creatures and solid objects.

	"You unleash cataclysmic forces of nature over a vast area. The area affected is an entire geographic region within sight of the caster, such as a valley, the caverns beneath a mountain, or a lake from shore to shore. If the geographical area is especially large (a great plain, an ocean, etc.), then even this spell can't affect it entirely. Assume a maximum 1-mile-radius area of effect centered on a point chosen by the caster. To properly channel the massive energy this spell requires, the caster must be within the area of effect, if only at its periphery.": "你在一个广阔的区域内释放出自然界的灾难性力量。受影响的区域是施法者视线范围内的整个地理区域，比如一个山谷，山下的洞穴，或者一个湖泊从岸边到岸边。如果这个地理区域特别大（一个大平原，一个海洋，等等），那么即使这个法术也不能完全影响它。假设以施法者选择的一个点为中心，最大半径为1英里的效果区域。为了正确引导这个法术所需的巨大能量，施法者必须在效果区域内，即使只是在其外围。",
	"The entire chosen region becomes a nightmare of natural disasters. Scalding geysers erupt. Caverns collapse. Crevasses split wide open. All structures and living creatures in the area of effect sustain {@dice 5d6} points of bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.

	"The effects of the curse can be manifold; a colossal sea monster might attack the ship the cursed creature is on, or terrible weather could becalm it, smash it, or the ship could spring leaks, or its food and water supplies could rot, etc. The GM is encouraged to be creative about plaguing the ship; many unfortunate things can happen before the ship is destroyed or sunk to make the crew's lives miserable and make them hate the cursed mariner. Eventually, however, the curse always destroys a ship that the target sails on.": "诅咒的影响可以是多方面的；一个巨大的海怪可能会攻击被诅咒的生物所在的船，或者可怕的天气可能会使它毁灭，粉碎它，或者船可能会漏水，或者它的食物和水供应可能会腐烂，等等。我们鼓励GM对困扰船舶的问题进行创新；在船舶被摧毁或沉没之前，可以发生许多不幸的事情，使船员的生活变得悲惨，使他们憎恨被诅咒的水手。然而，最终，诅咒总是会毁掉目标人物航行的船只。",

	"You consume the essence of a creature that died within the past day. By doing so, you gain some of the general knowledge of that creature.

A 20-foot-deep pit could become effectively 40 feet deep. Conversely, if distance is halved, a 60-foot corridor would be treated as only 30 feet long. Weapon and spell ranges are affected by the change, as is falling damage. There is no apparent change in the size of creatures or objects in the affected space, but the space itself appears longer or shorter.

If it hits, the foot does {@damage 10d8} force damage, knocks the target {@condition prone}, and restrains it. A successful Strength saving throw halves the damage and prevents the target from being knocked {@condition prone} or {@condition restrained}. A {@condition restrained} creature takes {@damage 4d8} force damage at the end of each of its turns. The restraint ends automatically if the foot moves or attacks again. Otherwise, a {@condition restrained} creature can escape by using an action to make a successful Strength check against your spell saving throw DC.": "作为一个动作，你可以指挥这只脚踩踏相邻的生物。对该生物进行一次近战法术攻击。如果命中，这只脚会造成{@damage 10d8}的力量伤害，击倒目标{@condition prone}，并束缚住它。如果力量救赎成功，则伤害减半，并防止目标被击倒（%2%）或（%3%）。一个{@condition restrained}的生物在其每个回合结束时受到{@damage 4d8}的力量伤害。如果脚部再次移动或攻击，束缚会自动结束。否则，一个{@condition restrained}的生物可以通过使用一个动作，对你的法术蓄力DC进行成功的力量检查来逃脱。",
	"Instead of stomping, you can also command the foot to kick; this also does {@damage 10d8} force damage, but instead of being knocked {@condition prone} and {@condition restrained}, the target is pushed up to 60 feet. A successful Strength saving throw by the target creature halves the damage and negates the push effect.": "你也可以命令脚踢，而不是跺脚；这也会造成{@damage 10d8}武力伤害，但目标不是被击倒{@condition prone}和{@condition restrained}，而是被推至60英尺。如果目标生物的力量救赎成功，则伤害减半，并抵消推的效果。",
	"The foot is big enough to provide cover and to prevent movement through its space.": "这只脚足够大，可以提供掩护并防止通过其空间移动。",
	"An aura that inflicts an overwhelming sense of despair radiates from you in a 30-foot-radius; the aura moves with you.": "一个能让人产生绝望感的光环从你身上散发出来，半径为30英尺；光环随你移动。",
	"Each creature that's inside the aura when the spell is cast or that enters the aura must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature must subtract {@dice 1d6} from its attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks that it makes inside the aura. In addition, a creature other than you inside the aura must also make a Charisma saving throw before attacking or casting a spell; If the saving throw fails, the creature hesitates instead and takes no action.": "当施法时，每个在光环内的生物或进入光环的生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物必须从它在光环内的攻击卷、救赎卷和能力检查中减去（%0%）。此外，除了你之外，在光环内的其他生物在攻击或施法之前也必须做一个智慧救赎动作；如果救赎动作失败，该生物就会犹豫不决，不采取任何行动。",
	"You curse one living creature to never enter a location you name, upon pain of death. The location can't be larger than 1 square mile. If the creature approaches within 100 feet of the banned location, it becomes aware of the danger it is in. If the creature voluntarily enters the location, the creature immediately drops to 0 hit points, and it can't regain hit points while inside the area.": "你诅咒一个生物永远不能进入你指定的地点，否则就会死亡。这个地点不能大于1平方英里。如果该生物接近被禁止的地点100英尺以内，它就会意识到它所处的危险。如果该生物自愿进入该地点，该生物的命中率会立即下降到0，并且在该区域内无法恢复命中率。",
	"The mark of exile is an invisible sigil on the creature. It can be viewed with detect magic and similar magic.": "流放的标记是生物身上的一个无形的符号。它可以用探测魔法和类似的魔法来查看。",
	"The mark of exile can be removed with magic that lifts a curse, but only if the spell is cast with a 7th-level or higher spell slot.": "流放的印记可以用解除诅咒的魔法来消除，但只有在用七级或更高的法术槽施法时才可以。",
	"One undead creature you can see becomes imbued with the essence of fire. A flaming sigil appears above the creature's head, and the creature's eye sockets smoke and burn with orange flame. The creature gains resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to cold damage, and its melee attacks do an additional {@damage 2d6} fire damage when they hit.": "一个你能看到的不死生物被注入了火的精华。一个燃烧的符号出现在该生物的头顶上，该生物的眼窝冒烟并燃烧着橙色火焰。该生物获得对火系伤害的抗性和对冷系伤害的脆弱性，它的近战攻击在击中时产生额外的（%0%）火系伤害。",
	"One undead creature you can see is imbued with the essence of ice. An icy sigil appears above the creature's head, and the creature's eye sockets glow with frigid blue energy. The creature gains resistance to cold damage and vulnerability to fire damage, and its melee attacks do an additional {@damage 2d6} cold damage when they hit.": "你能看到的一个不死生物被灌注了冰的精华。一个冰冷的标志出现在该生物的头顶上，该生物的眼窝发出冰冷的蓝色能量的光芒。该生物获得了对寒冷伤害的抗性和对火焰伤害的脆弱性，它的近战攻击在击中后会造成额外的（%0%）寒冷伤害。",
	"One undead creature you can see is imbued with the essence of acid. A green sigil appears above the creature's head, and acid trickles from its eye sockets. The creature gains resistance to acid damage and vulnerability to lightning damage, and its melee attacks do an additional {@damage 2d6} acid damage when they hit.": "你能看到的一个不死生物被灌注了酸的精华。一个绿色的标志出现在该生物的头顶上，酸液从它的眼窝里流出来。该生物获得对酸液伤害的抗性和对雷电伤害的脆弱性，它的近战攻击在命中后会造成额外的（%0%）酸液伤害。",
	"You curse one item to only accept one creature you can see as its rightful owner. In the hands of any other creature, the item feels unnatural; that creature has tactical disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls when using the item.": "你诅咒一件物品只接受一个你能看到的生物作为它的合法主人。在任何其他生物的手中，该物品都感觉不自然；该生物在使用该物品时，在所有能力检查和攻击卷上都有战术上的劣势。",
	"You enchant one living creature you can see to believe it is more skilled than it really is. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. A successful save negates the spell, but if the saving throw fails, the creature's overconfidence causes it to act rashly and without forethought. For the duration of the spell, the creature can't move away from an opponent, and it provokes an opportunity attack from adjacent creatures whenever it takes an action. It also suffers a −2 penalty to damage rolls and Wisdom saving throws.": "你对一个你能看到的生物施展魔法，使其相信自己比实际情况更有能力。该生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果救赎成功，就可以否定该咒语，但如果救赎失败，该生物的过度自信会导致它轻率地行动，而没有深思熟虑。在咒语的持续时间内，该生物不能远离对手，并且每当它采取行动时都会引起邻近生物的机会攻击。它还会在伤害卷和智慧救赎中受到-2的惩罚。",
	"The creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns; the spell ends after two successful saves, which need not be consecutive.": "该生物可以在其每个回合结束时重复智慧救赎的动作；在两次成功救赎后，咒语就会结束，这两次救赎不需要是连续的。",

	"Your touch binds an unattended item weighing no more than 10 lbs. to you. The object can't be lost, and it can't be separated from you by more than 10 feet. It floats and moves after you as if it were attached by an invisible string. The spell ends if you cast it on another item.": "你的触摸将一个重量不超过10磅的无人看管的物品与你绑定。该物品不能丢失，也不能与你分开超过10英尺。它在你身后漂浮和移动，就像它被一根无形的绳子绑住一样。如果你对另一件物品施法，该咒语就会结束。",
	"You create an illusion around yourself that makes you seem larger, fiercer, and more imposing. For the duration of the spell, add {@dice 1d6} to your Charisma (Intimidate) checks.": "你在自己周围创造一个幻象，使你看起来更大、更凶猛、更有气势。在咒语持续期间，你的魅力（恐吓）检查会增加（%0%）。"
