	"A glistening shard flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a booming crackle into an explosion of ice. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes {@damage 8d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "一块闪闪发光的碎片从你的手指上闪到你选择的范围内的一个点上，然后伴随着轰隆隆的噼啪声绽放出冰的爆炸。以该点为中心的20英尺半径范围内的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。蓄力失败时，目标会受到{@damage 8d6}的寒冷伤害，蓄力成功则受到一半的伤害。",
	"The ice spreads around corners. It freezes liquids in the area that aren't in sealed containers.": "冰在角落里蔓延。它冻结了该地区不在密封容器中的液体。"
