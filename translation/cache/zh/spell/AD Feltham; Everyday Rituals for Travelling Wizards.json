	"You perform a quick ritual, gathering together some kindling and muttering some magic words. A few moments later the kindling catches fire and continues to burn for up to 10 hours. This spell affects an area of up to 3 cubic feet. The kindling used in this spell does not need to be dry, and is not consumed by the casting of the spell or by the fire, enabling it to be reused for future castings.": "你做了一个快速的仪式，把一些火种聚集在一起，并喃喃自语地说着一些魔法。片刻之后，火种着火，并持续燃烧长达10小时。这个法术影响的范围最多只有3立方英尺。这个法术中使用的木柴不需要干燥，也不会被施法或火所消耗，使其能够在未来的施法中重新使用。",
	"You draw together a handful of ordinary dirt and perform the gestures and words of this ritual. The dirt permanently transmutes into edible, if slightly suspicious-tasting sausages. The sausages still need to be cooked as normal sausages would. The sausages provide the equivalent of one rations worth of nutrition.": "你把一把普通的泥土放在一起，然后做这个仪式的手势和文字。泥土会永久地转化为可食用的香肠，尽管味道略显可疑。这些香肠仍然需要像普通香肠一样烹制。这些香肠提供的营养相当于一个口粮的价值。",
	"You perform this ritual over an object that you can touch with a volume of up to 10 cubic feet. The temperature of the target drops to just above freezing. Frost does not form on the target, but the target becomes cool to the touch. Food and other provisions with a limited shelf-life enchanted in this manner are perfectly preserved and remain good to eat.": "你对一个你能触摸到的、体积不超过10立方英尺的物体进行这个仪式。目标物的温度会下降到刚刚超过冰点。目标物上不会形成冰霜，但目标物会变得触手可及。以这种方式施法的食物和其他保质期有限的物品会被完美地保存下来，并保持良好的食用性。",
	"You perform this ritual and summon into existence an glowing, rotating spike of force that floats about 3 feet from the floor. This spike floats in space and slowly rotates around its axle. This spit can take a weight of up to 100 lbs before falling to the ground and dissipating.": "你执行这个仪式，并召唤出一个发光的、旋转的力钉，漂浮在离地面约3英尺的地方。这根钉子漂浮在太空中，围绕着它的轴慢慢旋转。这根钉子可以承受高达100磅的重量，然后落到地上消散。",
	"This spell was designed to act as a roasting spit for when time and energy was scarce. Meat skewered on the spike can be left unattended and will slowly rotate until the spell's duration ends.": "这个法术被设计为在时间和精力不足的情况下充当烤肉架。串在钉子上的肉可以无人看管，并会慢慢旋转，直到法术的持续时间结束。",
	"You perform this ritual and enchant a water skin containing a small amount of water to instantly and magically refill to capacity (maximum 1 cubic foot).": "你执行这个仪式，并对一个装有少量水的水皮进行施法，使其瞬间神奇地补充到容量（最大1立方英尺）。",
	"You perform a quick ritual and conjure a small dome of energy above your head. The dome is transparent, but vaguely visible because of a faint glowing blue light and a tendency for rain to sit on the surface of the dome. This dome is approximately 4 feet wide and is centred on a point about 1 foot above the caster's head. As the caster moves, the umbrella follows him at walking speed. The umbrella has 5 hit points. If it ever takes damage that exceeds this hit point total the umbrella instantly vanishes. If the caster passes through an opening that is narrower than the diameter of the umbrella, the umbrella may not pass and remains floating in place. If the umbrella is ever more than 10 feet from the caster it ceases to exist.": "你做了一个快速的仪式，在你的头顶上变出一个小型的能量圆顶。穹顶是透明的，但由于微弱的蓝光和雨水在穹顶表面停留的趋势，使其隐约可见。这个穹顶大约有4英尺宽，以施法者头部上方约1英尺处为中心。当施法者移动时，雨伞会以步行速度跟随他。伞有5个打击点。如果它受到的伤害超过了这个命中率，伞就会立刻消失。如果施法者通过一个比伞的直径更窄的开口，伞可能无法通过，并保持在原地漂浮。如果伞离施法者超过10英尺，它就不存在了。",
	"This ritual functions exactly like Summon Umbrella, with the exception that the dome of force that is created is not transparent. Instead, the dome is black and blocks out light, creating an area of shadow which falls in line with the umbrella and a light source as any natural shadow would do.": "这个仪式的功能与召唤伞完全一样，不同的是，被创造出来的力量圆顶不是透明的。相反，穹顶是黑色的，阻挡了光线，创造了一个阴影区域，与伞和光源保持一致，就像任何自然阴影一样。",
	"When you cast this spell, target one tent that you can touch. The spell causes the tent to become impervious to water for the duration of the ritual, even though the physical material that the tent is made from may contain physical holes or other damage that would normally allow water to pass through unimpeded.": "当你施展这个法术时，以一个你可以触摸到的帐篷为目标。该法术使帐篷在仪式持续期间变得不透水，即使帐篷的物理材料可能含有物理孔洞或其他损坏，通常会让水无阻地通过。",
	"You perform this ritual and touch one cloak. That cloak becomes magically enchanted to become warm and comfortable to the wearer, perfectly adjusting to match the wearers ideal body temperature. This effect only affects the inside of the cloak. The exterior of the cloak remains the same temperature of the air around the wearer.": "你执行这个仪式并触摸一件斗篷。那件斗篷会被施以魔法，使穿戴者感到温暖和舒适，完美地调整到符合穿戴者的理想体温。这个效果只影响到斗篷的内部。斗篷的外部保持与穿戴者周围空气相同的温度。",
	"You enchant a single iron nail. That nail magically floats a few inches above your outstretched palm and its sharpened end points unerringly to the magnetic north. The enchanted nail can be stowed in a bag and pulled out again later for future reference without affecting the magic of the ritual. Natural and magical magnetic effects, or large quantities of magnetic metals, may interfere with the effect of this ritual.": "你给一根铁钉施了魔法。这根钉子神奇地漂浮在你伸出的手掌上方几英寸处，它削尖的一端准确无误地指向磁北。被施了魔法的铁钉可以放在袋子里，以后再拿出来参考，不会影响仪式的魔力。自然和魔法的磁性效应，或大量的磁性金属，可能会干扰这个仪式的效果。",
	"Every adventurer is familiar wit the story of the brave hero who escapes a labyrinth by laying a trail of string to mark his route. This spell was inspired by those stories.": "每个冒险家都熟悉这样一个故事：勇敢的英雄通过铺设绳子标记路线来逃离迷宫。这个咒语的灵感来自这些故事。",
	"You enchant a ball of string to create a magical thread. You can tie this thread onto any point that normal string may be anchored to. This ball of string can then be unwound to leave a trail as you explore your environs. The string extends in an unlimited fashion, unspooling as much as is required. When the string is rolled up again, it returns to the same length as it started. If the string is ever cut (which requires no special effort) the extra lengths of string disappear.": "你对一个线团施展魔法，创造出一条神奇的线。你可以把这根线系在任何一个普通绳子可以固定的地方。当你探索周围的环境时，这个线球可以被解开，留下一个痕迹。绳子可以无限延伸，需要多少就放多少。当绳子再次被卷起时，它又恢复到开始时的长度。如果绳子被剪断（这不需要特别的努力），多余的绳子长度就会消失。",
	"You enchant a page of blank parchment and pour an amount of ink onto its surface. You then mutter a binding between the ink and your own mind. As you explore your environment and become aware of the geography of the local area the ink on the parchment moves around, forming a near approximation map of the area that you have explored. The Mystic Cartographer does not reveal any details of the area that you have not yet discovered. Work together with your DM to create an accurate map of the area, expanding it as you explore further.": "你给一页空白的羊皮纸施了魔法，并在其表面倒上一定量的墨水。然后你在墨水和你自己的思想之间嘀咕了一句。当你探索你的环境并意识到当地的地理环境时，羊皮纸上的墨水会四处移动，形成一张你所探索的区域的近似地图。神秘的制图师不会透露你尚未发现的该地区的任何细节。与你的管理人合作，为该地区绘制一张精确的地图，随着你的进一步探索而扩大它。",
	"You perform the words and actions of this ritual and enchant an area 30 ft. in radius. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect any secret passages, hidden doors or other disguised routes within this area.": "你执行这个仪式的言语和行动，使一个半径为30英尺的区域着魔。你在智慧（感知）检查中获得优势，以探测这个区域内的任何秘密通道、隐藏的门或其他伪装的路线。",
	"When you establish a campsite you may walk a circle around the campsite that is up to 30 ft. in radius. When you do so, the features of your campsite, including any tents, equipment, people and animals fall under the effects of an enchantment which confer stealth onto all of them while they are within the area of effect. Any creatures wishing to detect the campsite must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check against a DC equal to your spell casting DC. If the check fails, the creature is unable to perceive the campsite in any way.": "当你建立一个营地时，你可以围绕营地走一圈，半径不超过30英尺。当你这样做的时候，你的营地的特征，包括任何帐篷、设备、人和动物都会受到魔法的影响，当他们在效果范围内的时候，都会被赋予隐身效果。任何想要探测营地的生物都必须成功地进行智慧（感知）检查，检查的DC等于你的施法DC。如果检定失败，该生物就无法以任何方式察觉到宿营地。",
	"Creatures that are consciously aware that the campsite exists, for example those that have left the site and return to it or those that have been told that the campsite exists, may make this check with advantage.": "有意识地意识到营地存在的生物，例如那些已经离开并返回营地的生物，或者那些已经被告知营地存在的生物，可以有优势地进行这种检查。",
	"When you cast this spell you enchant one normal candle and bind its flame to your fingertips. Whenever you click the fingers of your right hand the candle will burst into flame and illuminate the area. When you click your fingers again the candle instantly snuffs out. You may repeat this trick as many times as you like, until the candle is depleted or the spell's duration ends.": "当你施展这个法术时，你会对一支普通的蜡烛施以魔法，并将其火焰捆绑在你的指尖。每当你点击你右手的手指时，蜡烛就会爆发出火焰，照亮这个区域。当你再次点击你的手指时，蜡烛会立即熄灭。你可以随心所欲地重复这个把戏，直到蜡烛被耗尽或咒语的持续时间结束。",
	"When you cast this ritual you enchant a bedroll to make it as comfortable as a feather bed for the duration of the night. As a result of this enchantment you experience incredibly good sleep. You may gain the benefits of a full night of sleep after just 6 hours, rather than 8. As elves do not sleep, this spell can not enhance their sleep. Their trance ability is not compatible with the effects of this spell.": "当你施展这个仪式时，你会对一个床铺进行施法，使其在夜间像羽绒床一样舒适。作为这个魔法的结果，你会体验到难以置信的好睡眠。你可以在短短6小时后获得整晚睡眠的好处，而不是8小时。由于精灵不睡觉，这个咒语不能增强他们的睡眠。他们的恍惚能力与此咒语的效果不相容。",
	"When you cast this spell you enchant a circular locus around your current location, centred on yourself. If any creature larger than a mouse crosses this line either on land or in the air in the next 8 hours, you magically sense the intrusion, even if you are asleep. You may choose to wake up when this effect is triggered.": "当你施展这个法术时，你会在你目前的位置周围施展一个圆形的区域，以你自己为中心。如果在接下来的8小时内，任何比老鼠大的生物在陆地或空中越过这条线，你就会神奇地感觉到这种入侵，即使你在睡觉。你可以选择在这个效果被触发时醒来。",
	"You perform a quick ritual and conjure phantasmal figure. This figure is an experienced stablehand and groom. This groom is unable to speak, but is very knowledgeable about horses and will tend to any horses with devotion and care for the duration of the spell.": "你做了一个快速的仪式，幻化出一个幻影。这个形象是一个经验丰富的马夫和马厩。这个马夫不能说话，但他对马有很深的了解，并会在咒语的持续时间内尽心尽力地照顾任何马匹。",
	"Horses are naturally calmed by the presence of the groom and gain advantage to Wisdom saving throws while the groom is within their eyesight.": "马匹自然会因为马夫的存在而平静下来，当马夫在它们的视线范围内时，马匹会获得智慧拯救的优势。",
	"You enchant a wagon that you are touching. That wagon slowly and gently lifts into the air, coming to hover two inches above the surface of the ground. This wagon can not move under its own power, but can easily be pulled by horses, even over difficult or soft ground. This is a good spell to use when a wheel breaks, as the wagon does not need wheels to hover and move. Additionally, it can be a great way to get a wagon out of a muddy patch. When the spell's duration has expired, the wagon slowly stinks down to rest on the ground again.": "你对一辆你所接触的马车施以魔法。那辆马车慢慢地、轻轻地升到空中，在离地表两英寸的地方盘旋。这辆马车不能靠自己的力量移动，但可以很容易地被马匹拉动，即使是在困难或柔软的地面上。当车轮断裂时，这是一个很好的法术，因为马车不需要车轮就能悬停移动。此外，这也是把马车从泥泞的地方弄出来的好办法。当咒语的持续时间过后，马车会慢慢地发臭，再次停在地上。",
	"When you cast this spell, target one wagon that you can touch. The spell causes the wagon to become completely impervious to water for the duration of the spell, even though the physical material that the wagon is made from may contain physical holes or other damage that would normally allow water to pass through unimpeded.": "当你施展这个法术时，以你能接触到的一辆马车为目标。该法术使马车在法术持续期间完全不受水的影响，即使马车的物理材料可能含有物理孔洞或其他损坏，通常会让水无阻地通过。",
	"When you cast this spell, any wet objects or creatures within the ritual's area of effect will slowly dry out as though left in the warm summer sun. The spell effect lasts up to 8 hours, however many things will be well and truly dried out after only an hour or so. Discuss with your DM exactly how long it will take for your objects and creatures to dry.": "当你施展这个法术时，在仪式作用范围内的任何潮湿物体或生物都会慢慢变干，就像留在夏天温暖的阳光下一样。咒语效果最多持续8个小时，然而许多东西在一小时左右就会真正变干了。与你的管理员讨论你的物品和生物究竟需要多长时间才能干透。",
	"One unique feature of this ritual is that, in written form in a spell book, the spell instructions are completely impervious to water damage. If a spell book ever becomes waterlogged, this spell will remain completely readable. Casting it on the wet spell book will dry out the book and return it to its pre-water damaged state, ensuring all spells contained within the book are useable in the future.": "这个仪式的一个独特之处在于，在书面形式的咒语书中，咒语说明完全不受水渍的影响。如果一本咒语书曾经被水淹没，这个咒语将保持完全可读。在湿润的咒语书上施放它，会使书变干，恢复到水渍前的状态，确保书中包含的所有咒语在将来都能使用。"
