You can examine one person per round.": "你看着目标的眼睛，可以看到该生物是否被魔法符咒或任何类似的咒语所控制（这包括任何在目标对符咒免疫的情况下无法发挥作用的咒语，如暗示）。这个法术不会显示目标被施以何种符咒，也不会显示是谁在这个人身上施以符咒。你每回合可以检查一个人。",
	"You gain understanding of the balance of good, evil, law, chaos, naturalness, and unnaturalness there is in a 60-foot-radius sphere around you. The information you receive is vague (\"there are many unnatural things\" or \"there is much randomness and little order\") and don't reveal the exact nature or cause of the imbalance.": "你获得了对你周围60英尺范围内的善、恶、法律、混乱、自然和非自然的平衡的理解。你收到的信息是模糊的（\"有许多不自然的东西 \"或 \"有许多随机性，很少有秩序\"），并没有揭示不平衡的确切性质或原因。",

	"The object itself takes {@damage 5d10} force damage. All creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d6} fire damage and {@damage 3d6} piercing damage and is knocked {@condition prone} on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and remains standing on a successful save. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.": "该物体本身受到{@damage 5d10}力的伤害。所有在它10英尺范围内的生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。生物受到{@damage 3d6}的火焰伤害和{@damage 3d6}的穿刺伤害，并且在救赎失败时被击倒{@condition prone}，或者在救赎成功时受到一半的伤害并保持站立。火焰会点燃该区域内未被穿戴或携带的易燃物品。",

If the creature was on a different plane at that time, the spell fails.": "一个你能看到的生物会被送回它在24小时前所在的地方（不考虑行星旋转）。不愿意的生物可以用智慧救赎的方式来抵抗。如果其他生物或物体在你送它去的地方，它将出现在最近的空地上。如果该生物当时在不同的平面上，则法术失败。",

	"You gain the ability to bear hug a creature up to one size category larger or smaller than you. If you successfully make an unarmed attack, you can grapple that creature (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). As long as the grapple remains in effect, that target is {@condition restrained}.

While grappling someone, you cannot use your hands or arms for any other purpose.": "你获得熊抱一个比你大或小一个体型的生物的能力。如果你成功地进行了一次徒手攻击，你可以抓住那个生物（逃脱DC等于你的法术保命DC）。只要抓捕的效果还在，该目标就会被（%0%）。在你每个回合开始时，你可以收缩，造成{@dice 2d12}+你力量修正值的打击性伤害。在抓捕某人时，你不能使用你的手或手臂做任何其他用途。",
	"You touch two creatures and draw blood out from one (the \"donor\"), channel it through yourself, and infuse it into the other (the \"recipient\").

If the flame is snuffed out, it will automatically relight itself.": "你点燃一支蜡烛或灯笼--任何有灯芯的光源（与火把相反）。在咒语的持续时间内，这个火焰不能被非魔法手段所熄灭。如果火焰被掐灭，它将自动重新点燃。",
