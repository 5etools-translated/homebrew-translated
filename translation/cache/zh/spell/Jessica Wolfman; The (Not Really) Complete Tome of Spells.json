For instance, if a human with a Strength of 11 and Dexterity of 13 were to get an arm from an ogre with a Strength of 19 and Dexterity of 8, the human would have an effective Strength of 13 and Dexterity of 12 with that arm.

In addition, the recipient will retain its full sense of touch with the limb. Finally, a prosthetic limb can be built with attachments, hidden compartments, and the like. The limb's armor class depends on the material with which it was made.": "如果你使用假肢（通常是用木头或金属制成的），就没有被拒绝的可能，而且假肢的力量将与接受者的力量相同。如果肢体是完全铰接的，那么它的灵巧性也将与接受者相同（设计较差的肢体将对灵巧性有惩罚，而设计良好的（%0%），而且可能更昂贵的肢体，可能会给予多达+2的奖励）。此外，接受者将保留其对肢体的全部触觉。最后，假肢可以用附件、隐藏的隔间和类似的东西来建造。肢体的护甲等级取决于制作它的材料。",
