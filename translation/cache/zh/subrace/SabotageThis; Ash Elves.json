	"Accustomed to the volcanic heat of your ancestral homeland, you have resistance to fire damage.": "习惯于你祖先家乡的火山热，你对火灾伤害有抵抗力。",
	"You can call upon the spirits of your ancestors to protect you in your time of need. As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you targets you with an attack or harmful spell you can cast {@spell sanctuary} on yourself. The creature must immediately make a saving throw against the spell. When you cast the spell in this way, you don't require components. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Wisdom. Once you use this trait, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.": "你可以在你需要的时候呼唤你祖先的灵魂来保护你。作为反应，当你能看到的30英尺范围内的生物以你为目标进行攻击或有害的咒语时，你可以对自己施放（%0%）。该生物必须立即对该法术进行蓄力。当你以这种方式施法时，你不需要组件。你对这个法术的施法能力是智慧。一旦你使用这个特质，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",
	"Ash-grey skin, red eyes, coarse voices, and the occasional ritual scarring are the hallmarks of this elusive elven subrace.": "灰灰色的皮肤，红色的眼睛，粗糙的声音，以及偶尔的仪式性伤疤，是这个难以捉摸的精灵亚族的标志。",
	"These elves live in the wake of great volcanoes, revering their ancestors and often worshiping taboo gods and entities.": "这些精灵生活在大火山之后，崇敬他们的祖先，经常崇拜禁忌的神灵和实体。",
	"With a honed survival instinct, a natural inclination toward magic and battle, and a proud veneration for tradition, ash elves are known for carving out a pridetul existence in the harshest of places, from ashen wastes to humid swamps.": "灰烬精灵拥有经过磨练的生存本能，对魔法和战斗的自然倾向，以及对传统的自豪崇敬，他们以在最严酷的地方，从灰烬的荒原到潮湿的沼泽地，创造出一种骄傲的生存方式而闻名。",
	"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.": "精灵是一个具有超凡魅力的神奇民族，他们生活在这个世界上，但不完全是这个世界的一部分。他们生活在具有空灵之美的地方，在古老的森林中，或在闪烁着精灵之光的银色尖顶上，空气中飘荡着柔和的音乐，微风中飘荡着温柔的香气。精灵们热爱自然和魔法，热爱艺术和艺术性，热爱音乐和诗歌，以及世界上的美好事物。",
	"With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.": "精灵有着超凡脱俗的优雅和精致的五官，在人类和许多其他种族的成员看来，他们的美丽令人神往。他们平均比人类略矮，身高从远低于5英尺到略高于6英尺不等。他们比人类更苗条，体重只有100至145磅。男性和女性的身高差不多，男性只比女性略微重一些。",
	"Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.": "精灵的肤色涵盖了正常人类的范围，还包括铜色、青铜色和几乎是蓝白色的皮肤，绿色或蓝色的头发，以及像液态金或银池的眼睛。精灵没有面部毛发，体毛也很少。他们喜欢鲜艳的优雅服装，喜欢简单而可爱的珠宝。",
	"Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.": "精灵的寿命可以远远超过700年，这使他们对那些可能给寿命较短的种族带来更深困扰的事件有了广阔的视野。他们更经常地被逗乐而不是兴奋，更可能是好奇而不是贪婪。他们倾向于保持冷漠，不为琐碎的偶然事件所动。然而，当追求一个目标时，无论是冒险任务还是学习新的技能或艺术，精灵们都会专注而不懈地努力。他们结交朋友和敌人的速度很慢，而忘记他们的速度更慢。他们对琐碎的侮辱不屑一顾，对严重的侮辱则报以报复。",
	"Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.": "就像年轻的树枝一样，精灵们在面对危险时很灵活。他们相信外交和妥协能在分歧升级为暴力之前解决它们。他们已经知道从对他们林地家园的入侵中撤退，相信他们可以简单地等待入侵者的到来。但是当需要的时候，精灵们会展现出严厉的武术一面，展示出用剑、弓和战略的技巧。",
	"Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).": "大多数精灵居住在隐藏在树丛中的小型森林村庄。精灵们打猎，采集食物，种植蔬菜，他们的技能和魔法使他们无需开垦和耕种土地就能养活自己。他们是有天赋的工匠，可以制作出做工精细的衣服和艺术物品。他们与外人的接触通常是有限的，尽管有几个精灵通过用手工制品换取金属（他们对开采金属没有兴趣）来谋生。",
	"Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.": "在他们自己的土地之外遇到的精灵通常是旅行吟游诗人、艺术家或圣人。人类贵族会争夺精灵导师的服务，以便向他们的孩子教授剑术或魔法。",
	"Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious - even to those who fall short of their high expectations - which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.": "虽然他们可能很傲慢，但精灵一般都很亲切--甚至对那些没有达到他们高期望值的人--也就是大多数非精灵。尽管如此，他们还是能在几乎所有的人身上发现优点。",
	"\"Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.\"": "\"矮人是沉闷、笨拙的蠢货。但他们在幽默感、成熟度和礼仪方面的不足，在勇气方面得到了弥补。而且我必须承认，他们最好的铁匠生产的艺术品接近精灵的质量。\"",
	"\"Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They're a good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.\"": "\"半身人是追求简单快乐的人，这并不是一个值得蔑视的品质。他们是一个善良的民族，他们互相关心，照顾他们的花园，而且他们已经证明了自己在需要时比看起来更强硬。\"",
	"\"All that haste, their ambitions and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away - human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.\"": "\"所有的匆忙，他们的野心和动力，在他们短暂的生命逝去之前完成一些事情--人类的努力有时看起来如此徒劳。但当你看到他们所取得的成就时，你不得不欣赏他们的成就。如果他们能放慢脚步，学习一些技巧就好了。\"",
	"Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.": "精灵们出于漫游的欲望而从事冒险。由于他们非常长寿，他们可以享受几个世纪的探索和发现。他们不喜欢人类社会的节奏，因为人类社会每天都是有规律的，但几十年来不断变化，所以他们找到了能让他们自由旅行并设定自己的节奏的职业。精灵们也喜欢锻炼他们的武功或获得更强大的魔法力量，而冒险让他们能够做到这一点。有些人可能加入反抗压迫的叛军，有些人可能成为道德事业的拥护者。",
	"Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.": "精灵被视为儿童，直到他们宣布自己成年，在一百岁生日后的某个时间，在此之前，他们被称为儿童的名字。",
	"On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.": "在宣布成年时，精灵会选择一个成年人的名字，尽管那些在他或她年轻时认识的人可能会继续使用孩子的名字。每个精灵的成人名字都是独特的创造，尽管它可能反映了受人尊敬的人或其他家庭成员的名字。男性名字和女性名字之间几乎没有区别；这里的分组只反映了一般的趋势。此外，每个精灵都有一个家族的名字，通常是其他精灵语的组合。一些在人类中旅行的精灵将他们的姓氏翻译成普通话，但其他精灵则保留了精灵语版本。",
