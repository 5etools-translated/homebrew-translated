	"Extremely volatile and terrifyingly dangerous, high explosives combine magic and chemicals in a tightly-sealed container, designed to be directly planted by unlucky operatives. Trigger mechanisms vary, from remote detonation by magical command, to small constructs carrying flames, to simply throwing fireballs at the rough area the explosives were planted.": "极其不稳定和可怕的危险，烈性炸药将魔法和化学品结合在一个紧密密封的容器中，旨在被不幸的特工人员直接埋入。触发机制各不相同，有的通过魔法命令进行远程引爆，有的则是携带火焰的小型建筑，有的则是直接向埋设炸药的粗糙区域投掷火球。",
	"When detonated, any creature or object within a 25 foot radius of the explosive must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 12d6 force damage plus 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In addition, any other high explosives in the radius are detonated.": "当被引爆时，在爆炸物25英尺范围内的任何生物或物体必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，目标会受到12d6的力量伤害和6d6的火焰伤害，如果救赎成功，则会受到一半的伤害。此外，半径内的任何其他高爆炸药也会被引爆。",
	"Due to the inherent instability of such a potent weapon crammed into a tiny package (often using the least expensive resources available), any heavy impact is often enough to set the explosives off, includes dropping the explosives or hitting them as part of an attack. At the DMs discretion, a d6 should be rolled. On an even result, the explosive does not react to the impact, and may even be rendered useless, if the impact was from an attack. On an odd result, the explosive detonates.": "由于如此强大的武器被塞进一个很小的包装中（通常使用最廉价的资源），其固有的不稳定性，任何重击往往足以引爆炸药，包括掉落炸药或作为攻击的一部分击中它们。根据DM的判断，应该掷出一个D6。如果结果是偶数，炸药对冲击没有反应，甚至可能失去作用，如果冲击是来自攻击。如果是奇数，炸药会被引爆。"
