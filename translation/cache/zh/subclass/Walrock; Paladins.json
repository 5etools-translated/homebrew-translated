When a greedy baron levies unfair taxes that cut the poor to the bone, when a pompous dragon ransacks the countryside to build his own personal hoard, when a bloodthirsty tyrant forces the poor into conscripted service in his armies, to fight and die on the frontlines, the paladin of the Common Man will be there with the fury of the oppressed at their back, with thunder in their voice and fire in their eyes, and the will of the people behind their every word and action. To a paladin of the Common Man, tyrants and avaricious industrialists are worse than any fiend, and they must be thrown down, their schemes bent and broken, before the might of those they sought to keep beneath them.": "普通人的誓言源于团结，源于共同的苦难，源于对那些将靴子跟放在社会上最贫困者的集体脖子上的人的义愤填膺。当贪婪的男爵征收不公平的税款，将穷人压得喘不过气来时，当浮夸的巨龙洗劫乡村以建立自己的个人囤积物时，当嗜血的暴君强迫穷人应征入伍，在前线战斗和牺牲时，普通人的圣骑士将背负着被压迫者的愤怒，声音如雷，眼神如火，一言一行背后都是人民的意志。对普通人的圣骑士来说，暴君和贪婪的实业家比任何魔鬼都要坏，他们必须被打倒，他们的计划被打乱，在他们试图压制他们的人的力量面前被打倒。",

A paladin of the Common Man thus roughly upholds the following tenets:": "普通人的圣骑士所遵守的信条因人而异，但都带有相同的革命精神，即世界摆脱暴政所需的变革注定要发生，但要实现这一集体梦想，需要与每个普通人一起做很多工作。因此，一个普通人的圣骑士大致上坚持以下信条。",

	"Starting at 3rd level, you may expend one use of your Divine Sense feature as an action to inherently know the general nature of the love life of a specific creature with an Intelligence score of at least 8 within 60 feet of you.

	"When you use this ability, you may decide to trick the creature into believing that it has achieved this desire. If you do, the creature rolls an Intelligence save against your spell save DC. If it fails, the creature believes it has achieved its greatest desire, and hallucinates living its life under such conditions. This hallucination is convincing, and fully involves any of the creature's senses pertinent to the experience. The experience typically fully distracts the creature, and limits its awareness of other creatures and the true world around it, usually rendering it unable to take harmful actions or reactions. This creature repeats the Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and this effect ends if the creature succeeds, takes damage, or after a minute has passed. Creatures immune to charm effects may not be affected by this portion of this ability.": "当你使用这个能力时，你可以决定欺骗生物，让它相信它已经实现了这个愿望。如果你这样做，该生物会对你的法术救赎DC进行智力救赎。如果失败了，这个生物就会相信它已经实现了它最大的愿望，并产生幻觉，在这种条件下生活。这种幻觉是令人信服的，并且完全涉及到生物的任何与体验有关的感官。这种体验通常会完全分散生物的注意力，并限制其对其他生物和周围真实世界的认识，通常使其无法采取有害的行动或反应。这种生物在它的每个回合结束时都会重复智力救赎，如果生物成功、受到伤害或在一分钟后，这个效果就会结束。对魅惑效果免疫的生物可能不会受到这部分能力的影响。",
	"Beginning at 7th level, the love you feel cascades out from you in waves, bringing comfort and vivacity to those around you.

	"At 18th level, the range Oof this aura increases to 30 feet.": "18级时，这个光环的范围增加到30英尺。",
	"At 15th level, the compassion you carry within your heart is so powerful, your foes find it difficult to do you harm. When a creature within 30 feet of you that is not immune to charm effects damages you with a spell or attack, you may reduce that damage by your Charisma modifier.": "在15级时，你心中的同情心是如此强大，你的敌人发现很难对你造成伤害。当一个在你30英尺范围内的生物，如果不对魅惑效果免疫，用法术或攻击伤害你时，你可以用你的魅力修改器减少该伤害。",

If the creature fails this save, it drops any weapon it is holding in its hands, and the creature may not attack this turn.": "与你相邻的敌人如果开始他们的回合，并且不对魅惑效果免疫，就必须立即对你的法术救赎DC做出智慧救赎。如果该生物没有成功，它就会丢掉手中的任何武器，并且该生物在本回合不得攻击。",
	"This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or if you die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "如果你丧失能力或死亡，这个效果会提前结束。一旦你使用这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。"
