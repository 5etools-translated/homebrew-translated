	"Soulkeepers are responsible for the supervision of the wilderness and all life that dwells within, often wandering over a particular area or domain and offering their portection from the unnatural and the aberrant. Unlike druids, however, upon finding a poached animal or murdered innocent, they are not above restoring the balance their own way: namely, calling the soul back to the Material Plane. They have been known to speak to spirits and——in some extreme cases——raise the dead back to life, but always with the utmost respect and with the soul's willing permission.": "灵魂守护者负责监督荒野和居住在其中的所有生命，他们经常在一个特定的区域或领域内徘徊，并提供他们的保护，防止非自然的和反常的。然而，与德鲁伊不同的是，当发现被偷猎的动物或被谋杀的无辜者时，他们不惜以自己的方式恢复平衡：即召唤灵魂回到物质世界。他们已经知道与灵魂对话，并且--在一些极端的情况下--使死者复活，但总是以最大的尊重和灵魂的自愿同意为前提。",
	"Soulkeepers often have a companion of spiritual energy or of reanimated bone and tissue, which can be unsettling at times to more conventional societies, being seen as ghosts and zombies. But such companions are not beholden by dark magics, but often through a deep sacred bond that trascends life itself. Animals of the domain a Soulkeeper watches over all know the ranger in some regard, and consider them a friend, worthy of their service.": "灵魂守护者通常有一个精神能量或复活的骨骼和组织的伴侣，这有时会让更多的传统社会感到不安，被视为幽灵和僵尸。但这样的同伴并不是被黑暗的魔法所束缚，而是经常通过一种超越生命本身的深层神圣纽带。灵魂守护者所守护的领域的动物都在某种程度上认识游侠，并认为他们是朋友，值得他们为之服务。",
	"A ranger's view of the world begins (and sometimes ends) with that character's outlook toward civilized folk and the places they occupy. Some rangers have an attitude toward civilization that's deeply rooted in disdain, while others pity the people they have sworn to protect——though, on the battlefield, it's impossible to tell the difference between one ranger and another. Indeed, to those who have seen them operate and been the beneficiaries to their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express their opinion on any matter in the same way.": "一个游骑兵对世界的看法始于（有时也终于）该角色对文明人和他们所居住的地方的看法。有些游骑兵对文明的态度是根深蒂固的蔑视，而有些游骑兵则怜悯他们发誓要保护的人--尽管在战场上，不可能分辨出一个游骑兵和另一个游骑兵的区别。事实上，对于那些见过他们的行动并成为他们能力的受益者的人来说，游骑兵为什么要做他们所做的事几乎不重要。也就是说，没有两个游骑兵可能会以相同的方式表达他们对任何问题的看法。",
	"If you haven't yet thought about the details of your character's worldview, consider putting a finer point on things by summarizing that viewpoint in a short statement (such as the entries on the following table). How might that feeling affect the way you conduct yourself?": "如果你还没有考虑到你的角色的世界观的细节，可以考虑把事情做得更细，把这个观点概括在一个简短的声明中（比如下表中的条目）。这种感觉会如何影响你的行为方式？",
	"Towns and cities are mass graves haunted by the spirits of the animals that lost their homes.": "城镇和城市是被失去家园的动物的灵魂所困扰的乱葬岗。",
	"Civilization's expense poses the danger of early extinction for flora and fauna if left unchecked.": "如果不加控制，文明的支出会给动植物带来早期灭绝的危险。",
	"Towns and cities often have good homes for displaced animals if they open their hearts as well as their doors.": "乡镇和城市往往有很好的流离失所的动物的家，如果他们打开他们的心以及他们的门。",
	"Instead of consuming all adjacent natural resources, towns and cities should learn to slow their growth and recycle what they can. Haste makes waste.": "与其消耗所有邻近的自然资源，城镇和城市应该学会放慢增长速度，并回收他们可以回收的东西。匆忙造成浪费。",
	"Walls, buildings, statues: none of those stand the test of time compared to nature's reclaiming grasp.": "墙壁、建筑、雕像：与大自然的开垦相比，这些都经不起时间的考验。",
	"Cities breed contempt for the earth that birthed them, and are monuments to man's arrogance that their life holds greater worth than others.": "城市孕育了对孕育它们的地球的蔑视，是人类认为自己的生命比别人更有价值的傲慢的纪念碑。",
	"Every ranger begins with a favored enemy (or two). The determination of a favored enemy might be tied to a specific event in the character's early life, or it might be entirely a matter of choice.": "每个游侠开始时都有一个（或两个）喜欢的敌人。敌人的确定可能与人物早期生活中的特定事件有关，也可能完全是一个选择问题。",
	"What spurred your character to select a particular enemy? Was the choice made because of tradition or curiosity, or do you have a grudge to settle?": "是什么刺激了你的角色选择一个特定的敌人？是由于传统或好奇心而做出的选择，还是你有怨恨要解决？",
	"You seek revenge on your foe for the fallen in the forest, slain for sport or disregard for life.": "你为森林中的堕落者寻求报复，为运动或无视生命而被杀。",

	"You and your foe were simply born on opposing sides.": "你和你的敌人只是生在对立面。",
	"You hunt down your foe to give it a merciful death that others would not be so kind in delivering.": "你追捕你的敌人，给它一个仁慈的死亡，而其他人则不会这么仁慈地提供。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Soulkeeper Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.": "从3级开始，当你在这个等级中达到一定级别时，你会额外学习一个法术，如守魂人法术表所示。这个法术对你来说算作游侠法术，但不计入你所会的游侠法术数量。",
	"At 3rd level, you learn the {@spell speak with animals} spell, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells known. In addition, when you cast it by expending a spell slot, you can choose to target the corpse of a beast. If you do so, you can interact with the corpse as the {@spell speak with dead} spell.": "在3级时，你学会了（%0%）的法术，但它不计入游侠的已知法术数量。此外，当你通过消耗一个法术槽来施放它时，你可以选择以野兽的尸体为目标。如果你这样做，你可以像{@spell speak with dead}法术一样与尸体互动。",
	"By 3rd level, your meditations invoking spirits of the wilderness bring you a faithful companion, a soulbound companion. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See {@creature Soulbound Companion|NCSK|this creature's} game statistics in the Soulbound Companion stat block. You determine which beast the creature's appearance is based on and whether it resembles the translucence of a ghost or the emaciated gauntness of a zombie or skeleton; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.": "到了第三级，你召唤荒野之灵的冥想会给你带来一个忠实的伙伴，一个有灵魂的伙伴。它对你和你的同伴都很友好，并且服从你的命令。参见灵魂伴侣状态块中的（%0%）游戏统计。你决定这个生物的外观是基于哪种野兽，以及它是像鬼魂的半透明还是像僵尸或骷髅的憔悴憔悴；你的选择对它的游戏统计数据没有影响。",
	"In combat, the soulbound companion shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the {@action Dodge} action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take the action in its stat block or the {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, {@action Help}, {@action Hide} or {@action Search} action.": "在战斗中，灵魂伴侣分享你的主动权数，但在你之后立即进入它的回合。它可以自己移动和使用反应，但它在自己的回合中唯一采取的行动是（%0%）行动，除非你在自己的回合中采取额外行动，命令它采取其状态块中的行动或（%1%）、（%2%）、（%3%）、（%4%）或（%5%）行动。",
	"If you use your action to share your spiritual energy with your companion, it regains {@dice 2d6} hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The soulbound companion returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.": "如果你用你的行动与你的同伴分享你的精神能量，它就会恢复（%0%）的命中率。如果它在过去一小时内死亡，你可以用你的行动使它复活，只要你在它的5英尺范围内，并且你消耗了一个1级或以上的法术槽。被灵魂束缚的同伴在1分钟后恢复生命，其所有的命中率也得到恢复。",
	"At the end of a long rest, you can create a new soulbound companion, if you already have a soulbound companion from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.": "在长期休息结束时，你可以创造一个新的灵魂伴侣，如果你已经有了这个功能的灵魂伴侣，那么第一个灵魂伴侣会立即消亡。",
	"By 7th level, you discover new ways to manipulate life energy. Once per round, when either you hit a target with a weapon attack or your soulbound companion hits a target, you can choose to have all damage dealt by the attack to become radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and the creature takes an extra {@dice 1d8} of the chosen damage type.": "到了第七级，你发现了操纵生命能量的新方法。每回合一次，当你用武器攻击击中目标或你的灵魂伴侣击中目标时，你可以选择让攻击造成的所有伤害变成辐射伤害或坏死伤害（你选择），并且该生物会额外承受（%0%）所选伤害类型。",
	"In addition, when you or your soulbound companion reduces a hostile creature to 0 hitpoints, you can draw on the diffused lifeforce, regaining hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your ranger level (minimum of 1).": "此外，当你或你的灵魂伴侣将一个敌对的生物减少到0命中率时，你可以吸取扩散的生命力，重新获得相当于你的智慧修饰+你的游侠等级的命中率（最低为1）。",
	"At 11th level, when you cast {@spell animate dead}, you can choose to warp the corpse or pile of bones that you target into a suitable vessel for an animal spirit. The bones and flesh twist, contort, and reshape themselves to resemble a beast of your choice that has a challenge rating of 2 or lower.

	"The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the creature's statistics, with the following additional benefits:": "被召唤的生物在持续时间内对你和你的同伴友好。为被召唤的生物掷出主动权，它有自己的回合。它服从你对它发出的任何口头命令（不需要你采取行动）。如果你没有向它发出任何命令，它就会保护自己不受敌对生物的伤害，但除此之外就没有任何行动。DM拥有该生物的统计数据，并有以下额外的好处。",

Your companion can also take any action on its statblock to defend you or your companions during this time.": "当你或你的同伴的生命值降到0时，另一个人就会飞到复仇的怒火中，持续一分钟。在持续时间内，该生物在攻击卷和蓄力投掷上获得优势，并对（%0%）或（%1%）的免疫。你的同伴也可以在这段时间内采取其状态块上的任何行动来保护你或你的同伴。",
