	"The Circle of the Sands connects druid to the most primal powers within the deserts and dunes. These druids serve as guardians to old ruins and temples, as well as escorts to travelers who find themselves lost in the vast desert sands. In these tasks, members of this circle gain control over the earth itself, and the power that hides within. Many druids of this circle also find themselves with a unique relationship with the dead, and the undead. Desert tombs are home to many corpses, but all deserve respect and protection from raiders and thieves. Others use their physical power to defend temples to long lost gods.": "沙之环将德鲁伊与沙漠和沙丘中最原始的力量联系起来。这些德鲁伊充当古老遗迹和寺庙的守护者，以及护送发现自己迷失在广阔沙漠沙地的旅行者。在这些任务中，这个圈子的成员获得了对地球本身的控制，以及隐藏在其中的力量。这个圈子的许多德鲁伊也发现自己与死者和亡灵有着独特的关系。沙漠中的坟墓里有许多尸体，但所有的尸体都值得尊重，并受到保护，不受袭击者和盗贼的侵害。还有一些人利用他们的身体力量来保卫久违的神灵的庙宇。",

	"Also at 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel the force of a sandstorm into your form.
