	"The god that you worship is bizarre, and forgotten to almost all in the realms of men. Gods of Slime are often nameless, churning deities of filth, possessing no temples and few if any worshippers. It is, therefore, a mystery wherefore their immense power originates. Scholars of divinity speculate that, perhaps, the Slime Domain naturally occurs as a result of other gods' waste. Or perhaps, oozes themselves, in spite of being unintelligent in every conceivable sense, still possess the capability to worship at some level, and therefore empower these nameless gods.": "你所崇拜的神很奇怪，几乎被人界的所有人遗忘。粘液之神通常是无名的，搅动污秽的神灵，没有庙宇，如果有崇拜者，也很少。因此，他们巨大的力量是如何产生的，这是一个谜。神学学者们推测，也许，史莱姆领域是由于其他神的浪费而自然产生的。也可能，尽管在所有可想而知的意义上，渗出物本身是没有智慧的，但它们仍然拥有某种程度的崇拜能力，因此赋予这些无名的神灵以力量。",
	"At 1st level, you learn the {@spell acid splash} and {@spell poison spray} cantrips, which count as cleric cantrips for you.": "一级时，你学会了（%0%）和（%1%）的咒语，这些咒语对你来说算作牧师的咒语。",
	"Starting at 1at level, you have resistance to acid and poison damage.": "从1级开始，你对酸和毒伤害有抵抗力。",
	"Additionally, when you cast a spell which deals acid damage to a target, it takes an additional 1d4 acid damage. If the target carries or wears either metal armor or a metal shield, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one metal armor or shield of your choice takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.": "此外，当你施展一个对目标造成酸性伤害的法术时，它将受到额外的1d4酸性伤害。如果目标携带或穿戴金属盔甲或金属盾牌，它必须做一个灵巧的救赎动作。如果救赎失败，你选择的一件金属盔甲或盾牌会对其提供的攻击力产生永久的、累积的-1惩罚。降低到AC值10的盔甲或下降到+0奖励的盾牌会被摧毁。",
	"This acid damage increases by {@dice 1d4} when you reach 5th level ({@dice 2d4}), 11th level ({@dice 3d4}), and 17th level ({@dice 4d4}).": "当你达到5级({@dice 2d4})、11级({@dice 3d4})和17级({@dice 4d4})时，这种酸性伤害会增加{@dice 1d4}。",
	"At 2nd level, as an action, you can attempt to command an ooze you can see within 30 feet of you. This ooze must make a Wisdom saving throw or obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Divinity option again. An ooze whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect.": "在第2级时，作为一个行动，你可以尝试指挥你周围30英尺内你能看到的海怪。在接下来的24小时内，或者在你再次使用这个通道神性的选项之前，这只敖包必须进行智慧救赎或服从你的命令。一个挑战等级等于或大于你的等级的敖包对这个效果免疫。",
	"While an ooze is under your command, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to mentally command it if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn. If given no command, the ooze does not act.": "当敖包在你的指挥下时，如果它在你的60英尺范围内，你可以在你的每个回合使用一个额外的行动来精神上指挥它。你决定该生物在下一回合将采取什么行动，以及它将在哪里移动。如果不给它命令，它就不会行动。",
	"At 6th level, you can secrete slime from your skin and orifices as an action. For the next minute, you have advantage on checks against being grappled and, when a creature within your reach hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 3d6 acid damage to it.": "在6级的时候，你可以从你的皮肤和口中分泌粘液作为一个动作。在接下来的一分钟里，你对被抓捕的检查有优势，并且，当一个在你范围内的生物用近身攻击击中你时，你可以用你的反应对它造成3d6酸液伤害。",
	"At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra {@dice 1d8} acid damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to {@dice 2d8}.": "8级时，你获得了为你的武器攻击注入神圣能量的能力。在你的每个回合中，当你用武器攻击击中一个生物时，你可以使攻击对目标造成额外的（%0%）酸液伤害。当你达到14级时，额外的伤害会增加到（%1%）。",
	"Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to summon a {@creature gelatinous cube} to envelop your enemies. Choose a space you can see within 120 feet for the cube to appear. If you summon the cube into a creature's space, the creature is subject to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. You can command the cube as with your Rebuke Ooze feature.": "从17级开始，你可以用你的行动召唤一个（%0%）来笼罩你的敌人。在120英尺内选择一个你能看到的空间，让立方体出现。如果你将立方体召唤到一个生物的空间中，该生物会受到立方体的吞噬作用，并且在蓄力动作上处于劣势。你可以用你的 \"叱咤风云 \"功能来指挥这个立方体。",
	"The cube's maximum hit points are increased by twice your level, and, if cube calls for a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC instead.": "魔方的最大命中率增加了两倍，如果魔方要求救赎，它将使用你的法术救赎DC。",
	"The cube vanishes if it is reduced to 0 hit points, or after one hour. After using this ability to summon an ooze, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "如果方块的命中率降至0，或在一小时后消失。在使用这个能力召唤出一个水鬼后，你不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。"
