	"With this spell, the caster creates a small variation in probabilities. This variation lasts only a moment, but creates alternate results for one recent event. When the spell is cast, any one event attempted by the recipient is recalculated, essentially allowing (or forcing) the creature to make a new die roll.  This doesn't work on any Legendary or Lair Actions.": "通过这个咒语，施法者在概率上创造了一个小小的变化。这种变化只持续片刻，但却为最近的一个事件创造了替代的结果。当施法时，受术者尝试的任何一个事件都会被重新计算，本质上是允许（或强迫）生物进行新的掷骰。 这对任何传奇或巢穴行动都不起作用。",
	"Only events that begin and end in a single round can be affected and only one die is rerolled. If the creature is a willing recipient, the creature can choose which roll (the original or the new roll) affects him, more than likely picking the most successful. If the creature is unwilling, he must redo the action. The second result, whatever its outcome, cannot be changed.": "只有在一个回合内开始和结束的事件才能受到影响，而且只有一个骰子被重掷。如果该生物是自愿接受的，该生物可以选择哪一个卷轴（原卷轴或新卷轴）影响他，更有可能选择最成功的。如果该生物不愿意，他必须重做这个动作。第二个结果，无论其结果如何，都不能改变。",
	"Following the discovery of wild magic came the discovery of wild surges and the personal danger such surges create. After several wild mages destroyed themselves by rather spectacular means (or suffered very odd side effects), the chaos shield was created as protection from these surges.": "在发现了野生魔法之后，又发现了野生激流和这种激流带来的个人危险。在几个野性法师以相当壮观的方式毁掉自己（或遭受非常奇怪的副作用）之后，混沌盾被创造出来，作为对这些激增的保护。",
	"This spell imbues the wild mage with special protection against the effects of wild surges. It protects only against wild surges caused by the caster's own spells, not from the effects of another mage's wild surges.": "此法术赋予野生法师特殊的保护，使其免受狂暴冲击的影响。它只保护施法者免受自己的法术所造成的狂涌影响，而不包括其他法师的狂涌影响。",
	"When a wild surge affects a caster protected by chaos shield, they are allowed an INT saving throw against their own DC. If the saving throw is successful, the effect of the surge on the caster is negated. If the saving throw is failed, the caster is affected normally by the surge. The spell does not protect against wild surges that might be caused by its own casting.": "当狂暴波动影响到受混沌护盾保护的施法者时，他们被允许对自己的DC进行INT救赎。如果蓄力成功，施法者身上的暴涨效果就会被抵消。如果蓄力失败，施法者会正常地受到冲击的影响。该法术并不保护施法者免受可能由其自身施法引起的狂涌的影响。",
	"The chaos shield protects only the caster and does not negate the effects of a wild surge for other characters who might be in the area of effect. The caster cannot voluntarily cancel the protection once he has learned the nature of a wild surge; the chaos shield protects from both good and harmful effects. Thus, if a wild surge resulted in a heal spell for all characters within 10 feet of the caster, the protected caster might not benefit, while all others in the radius would be healed.": "混乱护盾只保护施法者，并不否定狂暴波动对其他可能处于影响范围内的角色的影响。一旦施法者了解了狂涌的性质，他就不能主动取消保护；混沌护盾既能保护好的效果也能保护有害的效果。因此，如果一个狂暴波动导致施法者周围10英尺内的所有角色都受到了治疗术的影响，受保护的施法者可能不会受益，而半径内的所有其他人都会得到治疗。",
	"The spell remains in effect until it negates a wild surge or the spell duration expires.": "咒语一直有效，直到它否定了一个狂暴的涌动或咒语持续时间过期。",
	"With this spell, the wizard empowers himself and others of his choosing with the ability to speak a secret language incomprehensible to others. Creatures designated to speak the language must be touching each other when the spell is cast.": "通过这个咒语，巫师赋予自己和他所选择的其他人说一种别人无法理解的秘密语言的能力。在施法的时候，被指定说这种语言的生物必须互相接触。",
	"Once cast, the characters can choose to speak normally or in their secret tongue. They can speak and understand this mysterious language fluently. Fool's speech is not recognizable as any known language, nor does it remotely sound like any language. A comprehend languages or tongues spell will not translate it. It can be understood by a character wearing a helm of comprehending languages and reading magic, although the normal percentage chances apply.": "一旦施放，人物可以选择正常说话或使用他们的秘密语言。他们可以流利地说和理解这种神秘的语言。愚人的语言不能被识别为任何已知的语言，也不像任何语言的声音。理解语言或方言的法术不会翻译它。它可以被一个戴着理解语言和阅读魔法头盔的角色所理解，尽管正常的百分比几率适用。",
	"This spell partially surrounds the recipient in a shimmering, hemispherical field of force. The field is transparent and moves with the subject, forming a shell about one foot away from his body. The shell serves as a shield against all forms of individually targeted missile attacks (including magic missiles and other spells). The caster designates the position of the shell (protecting the front, rear, side, or top of the recipient). The spell does not protect against area effect spells or other attacks that strike several creatures at once.": "这个咒语将受术者部分包围在一个闪闪发光的半球形力场中。这个力场是透明的，并随受术者一起移动，形成一个离他身体大约一英尺的外壳。这个外壳可以作为一个盾牌，抵御所有形式的单独目标导弹攻击（包括魔法导弹和其他法术）。施法者指定外壳的位置（保护受术者的前面、后面、侧面或顶部）。该法术不保护区域效应法术或其他同时攻击几个生物的攻击。",
	"Whenever an individual missile attack is directed at a protected creature, the baneful deflector activates. Instead of striking the target creature, the missile's target is determined randomly among all creatures within a 15-foot hemisphere of the protected creature, including the protected creature. The missile then changes course toward its new target with normal chances to hit. If the new target is beyond the range of the missile, no target is hit. If the protected creature is struck, the spell immediately fails. If several people are protected by baneful deflector, a missile will change course several times before reaching its target.": "每当一个单独的导弹攻击指向一个受保护的生物时，可恶的偏转器就会启动。导弹的目标不是击中目标生物，而是在受保护生物的15英尺半球形范围内的所有生物中随机决定，包括受保护生物。然后导弹改变路线，朝向它的新目标，并有正常的命中机会。如果新的目标在导弹的范围之外，则没有目标被击中。如果被保护的生物被击中，咒语立即失效。如果有几个人被禁忌偏转器所保护，那么导弹在到达目标之前会多次改变路线。",
	"With the utterance of a few words, this spell can hurl a creature to a random plane and leave him there. The target, if unwilling, is allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell fails. If unsuccessful, the victim and all items carried by him are sent to a random plane. To determine the plane, roll on the table below.": "只要说出几个字，这个咒语就能把一个生物扔到一个随机的平面上，并把他留在那里。如果目标不愿意，则允许他做一个拯救动作。如果成功，咒语会失败。如果不成功，受害者和他携带的所有物品会被送到一个随机的平面。要确定平面，请在下面的表格中滚动。",

	"Patternweave allows the caster to make sense of apparent chaos. The caster can see such things as pottery shards reformed into a whole pot, shreds of paper formed into a page, scattered parts as a working machine, or specific trails appearing out of overlapping footprints.": "图案编织术允许施法者对明显的混乱做出解释。施法者可以看到诸如陶器碎片被改造成一个完整的罐子，碎纸片被做成一页纸，散落的零件被做成一台工作的机器，或者从重叠的脚印中出现特定的轨迹。",
	"After casting the spell, the mage studies seemingly random elements--broken bits of glass, shreds of paper, intermingled trails, etc. The items to be studied must be tangible-- coded flashing lights, garbled speech, or thoughts of any kind cannot be studied.": "施法后，法师会研究看似随机的元素--破碎的玻璃片、碎纸片、混杂的痕迹等等。要研究的项目必须是有形的--编码的闪光灯、乱七八糟的语言或任何形式的思想都不能被研究。",
	"The wizard must study the random elements for one round, after which the DM secretly makes an Investigation check for the wild mage with advantage. If the check fails, the spell fails. However, if the saving throw is successful, the caster sees in their mind the pattern these objects form. If the items studied are truly random, no information is gained.": "巫师必须研究随机元素一回合，之后DM秘密地对野生法师进行调查检查，并取得优势。如果检查失败，咒语就会失败。然而，如果救赎成功，施法者会在脑海中看到这些物品形成的模式。如果所研究的物品确实是随机的，则不会获得任何信息。",

	"This spell gives the wild mage the ability to seize magical energy directed at him and reshape it as he desires. While it is in effect, the spell gives no visible sign of its existence. It offers no protection against area effect spells.": "这个法术使野生法师有能力夺取针对他的魔法能量，并按照他的意愿重新塑造它。在它生效的时候，该法术不会有任何明显的迹象表明它的存在。它不提供对区域效应法术的保护。",

	"If the saving throw is successful, the spell shape absorbs the magical energy of the opponent's spell. The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or as a reaction cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the sorcerer. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his spell slots. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates.": "如果蓄力成功，法术形状会吸收对方法术的魔法能量。然后野生法师可以选择让能量消散，或者作为一种反应向对方法师施放一个法术。返回的法术必须与原来的法术等级相同或更低，并且必须是巫师目前所记忆的。返还法术的行为并不耗费野生法师的任何法术槽。咒语能量不能被保存；如果不立即使用，它就会消散。",
	"For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a spell shape and is struck by a finger of death (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos has learned feeblemind. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his wild surge check (and doesn't get a wild surge) and the feeblemind is sent hurtling back at his foe.": "例如，野性法师哈莫斯受到法术形状的保护，被死亡之指（一个7级法术）击中。他的蓄力动作成功，现在可以施放一个7级或更低级的法术。哈莫斯已经学会了 \"弱智\"。由于这只是一个5级的法术，他选择将它投向他的敌人。他进行了狂暴检查（但没有得到狂暴），而feeblemind则被送回他的敌人身上。",
	"Hamos still has his original 5th tier slot available. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round.": "哈莫斯仍有他原来的第5层槽位可用。剩下的两个法术等级则会丢失，因为它们没有在同一回合中使用。",
	"If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape.": "如果一个野生法师同时被两个法术击中，他可以选择哪个法术来塑造。",
	"He suffers all effects of the remaining spell.": "他将受到剩余法术的所有影响。",
	"This spell \"steals\" the enchantment from a magical item and places it within another, non-magical item (the material component). Both objects must be touched by the wizard during casting. The two items must be of the same category (blunt weapon, edged weapon, ring, amulet, shield, armor, wand, etc.).": "这个咒语从一个魔法物品中 \"偷 \"出了魔法，并将其置于另一个非魔法物品（物质成分）中。在施法过程中，两个物品都必须被巫师接触到。这两件物品必须是同一类别的（钝器、刃器、戒指、护身符、盾牌、盔甲、魔杖等）。",
	"The enchantment can be transferred only to a nonmagical item. Only the energy of one item can be transferred; it is not possible to combine two magical items into one item. The new item has all the properties of the original magical item (including the same number of charges, if any).": "魔法只能转移到非魔法物品上。只有一件物品的能量可以被转移；不可能将两个魔法物品合并成一件物品。新的物品具有原始魔法物品的所有属性（包括相同的收费数量，如果有的话）。",
	"At the culmination of the spell, the original magical object is allowed an item saving throw against the casters save DC with all modifiers it is allowed as a magical item. Exceptionally powerful objects (such as artifacts) may be considered to automatically succeed the saving throw at the DM's discretion.": "在咒语结束时，原来的魔法物品被允许对施法者的救赎DC进行一次物品救赎，并允许其作为魔法物品的所有修改因素。异常强大的物品（比如神器）可以被认为是自动成功的，由DM决定。",
	"If the saving throw is successful, the magical object resists the effect and the spell ends in failure. If the roll is failed, the magical item loses all of its powers, which are transferred to the previously nonmagical object. Even if the magical item fails its saving throw, the spell's success is not guaranteed.": "如果救赎成功，魔法物品就会抵制该效果，并且该咒语以失败告终。如果投掷失败，魔法物品就会失去它所有的力量，这些力量会转移到之前的非魔法物品上。即使魔法物品的蓄力动作失败，也不能保证咒语的成功。",
	"There is a chance that the enchantment might be lost. The base chance of this occurring is 100%, modified by -5% per level of the caster. Thus, a 20th-level wizard has no chance of losing the magic. If the enchantment is lost, both items become nonmagical.": "有一个机会，魔法可能会丢失。这种情况发生的基本几率是100%，按施法者的每一级-5%修改。因此，一个20级的巫师没有机会丢失魔法。如果魔力消失了，两个物品都会变成非魔力。",
	"The material component is the nonmagical item which is to receive the enchantment.": "材料成分是要接受魔法的非魔法物品。",
	"It must be of equal or greater value than the object to be drained.": "它的价值必须等同于或高于要排泄的物体。",
	"This spell requires immense magical effort to cast, relegating it to the highest spell level. Stabilize negates the effects of wild magic regions, allowing the caster and all creatures in a 30-foot radius to cast spells and use magical items normally. The spell is centered on the caster and follows his movements.": "这个法术需要巨大的魔法努力才能施展，将其降至最高法术等级。稳定术否定了野生魔法区域的影响，允许施法者和30英尺范围内的所有生物正常施法和使用魔法物品。该法术以施法者为中心，并跟随他的行动。",
	"The caster's own spells never cause wild surges when cast within the duration of a stabilize spell, nor do the effects of wild surges extend into the protected area. Furthermore, the wild mage's spells function at his true level; {@table Wild Magic 2|wldm|Table 2} is not used to determine level variation. The spell affects wildstrike, wildzone, and wildwind.": "施法者自己的法术在稳定法术的持续时间内施放时，永远不会引起狂涌，狂涌的效果也不会延伸到保护区域内。此外，野性法师的法术以其真实等级发挥作用；（%0%）不用于确定等级变化。该法术会影响到狂暴、野区和野风。",
	"This peculiar wild magic creates a random fluctuation in the probabilities of existence. The spell can be cast only upon nonliving objects and can affect only materials within a 10'x10'x10' cube.": "这种奇特的野性魔法在存在的概率中创造了一种随机的波动。该法术只能对非生命体施放，并且只能影响10'x10'x10'立方体内的材料。",
	"Objects in the area of effect either remain normal and visible or they disappear (50% chance). The state of existence for any object is determined randomly and changes with each viewing and viewer. Thus, a single object could appear and disappear several times during the course of the spell. Furthermore, it might be \"there\" for one onlooker, but \"not there\" for another.": "影响范围内的物体要么保持正常可见，要么消失（50%的几率）。任何物体的存在状态都是随机决定的，并随着每次观看和观看者的变化而变化。因此，一个物体在施法过程中可能会出现和消失几次。此外，它可能对一个旁观者来说是 \"存在\"，但对另一个旁观者来说是 \"不存在\"。",
	"For example, a wild mage casts this spell on a doorway. The DM rolls percentile dice and determines the door is \"there\" for the wizard. The wizard's companion also looks at the door. The DM rolls and determines that the door is \"not there\" for the companion. The pair studies the door for several minutes, during which time the door does not change (this counts as a single viewing for each character). The wizard and his companion then close their eyes. When they look at the door again, new checks for each character reveal the door is \"not there\" for both characters.": "例如，一个野生法师对一个门洞施展这个法术。DM掷出百分率骰子，确定这扇门对巫师来说是 \"存在 \"的。巫师的同伴也看了看门。管理员掷骰子，确定门对同伴来说 \"不在那里\"。两人研究了几分钟，在此期间，门没有变化（这算作每个角色的一次观察）。然后巫师和他的同伴闭上眼睛。当他们再次看门的时候，每个角色的新检查显示，门对两个角色来说都是 \"不存在 \"的。",
	"The pair steps through the open archway and turns around to look at the door once again.": "这对夫妇走过打开的拱门，转身再次看向门。",
	"This time it is \"not there\" for the wizard, but \"there\" for his companion. This random changing continues throughout the duration of the spell.": "这次它对巫师来说是 \"不在\"，但对他的同伴来说是 \"在\"。这种随机变化在整个咒语的持续时间内持续进行。",
	"Objects that are \"there\" are normal in all respects. Doors can be opened, chests can be picked up and carried, and rocks can be used as barricades. Objects that are \"not there\" are gone, although their absence does not cause ceilings to collapse or other damage. A wizard could walk through a \"not there\" wall without difficulty.": "那些 \"存在 \"的物体在各方面都是正常的。门可以被打开，箱子可以被拿起和搬运，石头可以被用作路障。而 \"不存在 \"的物体则消失了，尽管它们的缺失并不会导致天花板坍塌或其他损坏。巫师可以毫无困难地穿过一堵 \"不存在 \"的墙。",
	"When two parties perceive a there/not there object differently, the object functions for each party according to its own perceptions. For example, a wizard hides behind a rock that he sees as \"there.\" Her enemy, a fighter, perceives the rock as \"not there\" and fires arrows at the wizard. The wizard would perceive the arrows as bouncing off the rock, while the fighter would perceive the arrows as missing their target or falling short.": "当两方对一个 \"有/无 \"的物体有不同的感知时，该物体就会根据自己的感知对每一方发挥作用。例如，一个巫师躲在一块石头后面，他认为那是 \"存在\"。她的敌人，一个战士，认为岩石是 \"不存在的\"，并向巫师射出了箭。巫师会认为箭被石头弹开，而战士会认为箭没有射中目标或没有射中。",
	"The fighter would be subject to a check before firing each arrow to determine whether his perception changes (assume that the fighter must look away from the rock every time he nocks an arrow; each time he takes aim, this counts as a new viewing).": "斗士在每次射箭前都要接受检查，以确定他的感知是否发生了变化（假设斗士每次射箭时都必须远离岩石；每次瞄准时，都算作一次新的观察）。",
	"After the spell is cast, any objects removed from the area of effect retain their uncertain existence for the duration of the spell. Thus, a pair of heroes could pick up a treasure chest, carry it down the hall, set it down, and discover it had vanished while their backs were turned. Worse still, one might see the chest and the other not!": "在施法后，任何从效果区移出的物体都会在施法期间保持其不确定的存在。因此，一对英雄可以拿起一个宝箱，把它搬到大厅里，放下它，然后发现它在他们转身的时候消失了。更糟糕的是，一个人可能看到了宝箱，而另一个人却没有看到",
	"With this spell, the wild mage creates a negative pattern in the random forces surrounding one creature. The creature is allowed a saving throw; if successful, the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, random chance falls into an unlucky pattern. Any action involving random chance (i.e., any time a die roll affects the character) performed by the victim during the next 2-20 rounds is under disadvantage; the worse result is always applied. (The victim rolls twice for attacks, damages, saving throws, etc., always using the worse die roll.)": "通过这个法术，野性法师在一个生物周围的随机力量中创造一个负面的模式。该生物被允许进行救赎，如果成功，咒语失败。如果蓄力失败，随机机会就会落入一个不吉利的模式。在接下来的2-20回合内，受害者进行的任何涉及随机机会的行动（即任何一次掷骰子影响到角色）都处于劣势；更坏的结果总是被应用。(受害者在攻击、伤害、蓄力等方面会掷两次骰子，总是使用较差的骰子。）",
	"A luckstone or similar magical device will negate unluck. Doing so, however, prevents the magical item from functioning for {@dice 2d10} rounds.": "幸运石或类似的魔法装置会否定不吉利。然而，这样做会使该魔法物品在{@dice 2d10}回合内无法发挥作用。",

	"A vortex is a swirling mass of magical energy, barely controllable by the caster. On the round of casting, a small sparkle of lights fills the air at the desired position. On the second round, a 7'-tall, multicolored tornado appears. From this moment on, the caster must maintain concentration in order for the vortex to remain.": "漩涡是一团魔法能量的漩涡，施法者几乎无法控制。在施法的那一轮，一个小的闪光点充斥在所需位置的空气中。在第二轮时，一个7英尺高的多色龙卷风出现。从这一刻起，施法者必须保持注意力集中，以使漩涡继续存在。",
	"Each round, the caster can move the vortex 60 feet. However, control of direction is not perfect. The caster has complete control over distance, but can only suggest the desired direction. The caster has a 50% chance of moving the vortex in the direction he desires; if the die roll indicates failure, the vortex moves according to the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles. Thus, the vortex usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move to either side or directly toward the caster. The vortex cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these, rebounding along the general line of movement. For example, if cast in a narrow hallway, the vortex might ricochet down the hall, bouncing from side to side.": "每一轮，施法者可以将漩涡移动60英尺。然而，对方向的控制并不完美。施法者可以完全控制距离，但只能建议想要的方向。施法者有50%的机会将漩涡移向他所期望的方向；如果掷骰子显示失败，漩涡就会根据手榴弹式导弹的散布图移动。因此，漩涡通常会向所希望的大方向移动，但有时也会向两侧或直接向施法者移动。漩涡不能穿过大于其作用范围的物体（它可以穿过小树苗，但不能穿过古橡树），并且会被这些物体重新定向，沿着一般的运动路线反弹。例如，如果在一个狭窄的走廊里施放，漩涡可能会在走廊里反弹，从一边弹到另一边。",
	"The vortex is composed of raw magical energy. Nonmagical creatures struck by the vortex suffer {@dice 2d4} points of random type of energy damage (Force, Necrotic, Radiant, Fire, Cold, Lightning). Magical creatures and spellcasters suffer {@dice 2d8} points of damage. Creatures struck are allowed a saving throw vs. magic to suffer only half damage.": "漩涡是由原始魔法能量组成的。被漩涡击中的非魔法生物会受到{@dice 2d4}点随机类型的能量伤害(力量、死亡、辐射、火、冷、闪电)。魔法生物和施法者受到{@dice 2d8}点的伤害。被击中的生物被允许对魔法进行救赎，只受到一半的伤害。",
	"Each time a creature is struck, there is a 5% chance that the vortex will explode in a wild surge. Use {@table Wild Magic 2|wldm|Table 2} to determine the results of any wild surge. If the vortex causes a wild surge, the spell ends immediately.": "每次有生物被击中，就有5%的机会让漩涡爆发出狂暴的力量。使用{@table Wild Magic 2|wldm|Table 2}来决定任何狂涌的结果。如果漩涡导致了狂涌，则法术立即结束。",
	"the vortex deals an additional {@dice d4} points of damage for non magical creatures, and an additional {@dice d8} to magical creatures": "漩涡对非魔法生物造成额外的{@dice d4}点伤害，对魔法生物造成额外的{@dice d8}",
	"By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to channel raw magical energy through himself, shaping it into any form or effect he desires. The energy is similar in many ways to a wish spell, but has unique differences.": "通过这个咒语，野生法师能够通过自己引导原始的魔法能量，将其塑造成他想要的任何形式或效果。这种能量在许多方面与愿望咒语相似，但也有独特的区别。",
	"Wildfire allows the caster to create the effect of any wizard spell of 8th level or lower. He need only have general knowledge of the spell and its effects; the spell does not need to be in his own spellbooks.": "野火允许施法者创造任何8级或以下的巫师法术的效果。他只需要对该法术及其效果有一般的了解；该法术不需要在他自己的法术书中出现。",
	"Spell attack and DC for the spell effects are made at a +2.": "法术攻击和法术效果的DC是以+2进行的。",
	"Wildfire can also be used in the creation of magical items. The energy created by the spell may be used to generate effects that are not created by known spells.": "野火也可用于创造魔法物品。法术创造的能量可以用来产生已知法术无法创造的效果。",
	"Wildfire can also be used to create mundane items out of nothing. The magical energy can be shaped and hardened to form solid objects. These objects have a greenish, glowing tinge and radiate magic. These objects are stronger than steel yet possess almost no weight. They are immune to fire, cold, electricity, and all forms of magical attack except dispel magic and wish spells. Even if they are subjected to these spells, a saving throw is allowed (equal to the creator's saving throw vs. spell).": "野火也可以用来无中生有地创造世俗的物品。魔法能量可以被塑造和硬化，形成固体物体。这些物体具有绿色的、发光的色彩，并放射出魔法。这些物体比钢铁更坚固，但几乎没有重量。它们对火、冷、电和所有形式的魔法攻击都免疫，除了驱散魔法和愿望法术。即使它们受到这些法术的影响，也允许进行救赎（等同于创造者对法术的救赎）。",
	"When creating objects, the caster is limited only by his own skill and the dimensions of the object. Items larger than a 10-foot-radius sphere cannot be fashioned. Creating the object requires only one round, regardless of size. Thus, a wizard could make an impenetrable dome or a small boat with this spell.": "当创造物体时，施法者只受限于他自己的技能和物体的尺寸。大于10英尺半径球体的物品不能被制造出来。创造物体只需要一个回合，无论大小。因此，一个巫师可以用这个法术制造一个坚不可摧的穹顶或一艘小船。",
	"Objects made of wildfire are neither stable nor permanent. Since the object is made of magic separated from the magical continuum, the material gradually deteriorates until the magical bonds become too weak to hold the wildfire in the chosen form, until the first short or long rest.": "由野火制成的物体既不稳定也不永久。由于物体是由与魔法连续体分离的魔法制成的，所以材料会逐渐变坏，直到魔法束缚变得太弱，无法将野火保持在所选择的形式，直到第一次短期或长期的休息。",
	"This spell cloaks the caster in a whirling band of scintillating colors, completely concealing him. The caster is able to see normally within and outside the shield.": "这个法术将施法者笼罩在一个闪烁着色彩的漩涡中，完全掩盖了他的身份。施法者能够正常看到防护罩内和防护罩外的情况。",
	"The wildshield protects the caster from the effects of spells and magical items. The shield can completely absorb {@dice 2d6} spell levels (i.e., if the roll of {@dice 2d6} results in 10, the shield could absorb ten 1st-level spells, two 5th-level spells, or any similar combination), thereby negating their effects on the caster. Both area effect spells and those individually targeted at the wild mage can be absorbed. In the case of area spells, the wildshield protects only the mage. All others in the area of effect suffer normal effects from the spell.": "魔法盾保护施法者免受法术和魔法物品的影响。盾牌可以完全吸收{@dice 2d6}的法术等级（即如果掷出{@dice 2d6}的结果为10，则盾牌可以吸收十个一级法术，两个五级法术，或任何类似的组合），从而否定它们对施法者的影响。区域效应的法术和那些单独针对野生法师的法术都可以被吸收。在区域法术的情况下，野性盾牌只保护法师。效应区域内的所有其他人都会受到该法术的正常影响。",
	"Wildshield also protects against wild surges, whether caused by the caster's magic or by an outside source. Each wild surge is considered equal to {@dice 1d6} spell levels. The spell remains in effect until it is either canceled by the caster or it reaches its spell level capacity. If the capacity is met exactly, the wildshield simply ceases to function. However, if the wildshield is struck by more spell levels than it can absorb, it explodes in a wild surge. The spell that triggered the surge is completely negated, its energy instead transformed into a wild surge (see Table 2). Since the shield no longer functions, the formerly protected wizard is subject to full effects of this wild surge.": "野性盾牌也能防止野性涌动，无论是由施法者的魔法还是由外部来源引起的。每一次狂涌都被认为等于（%0%）法术等级。咒语一直有效，直到它被施法者取消或达到其咒语等级容量。如果正好达到容量，野性盾牌就会简单地停止作用。然而，如果野性盾牌被超过它所能吸收的法术等级所击中，它就会爆发出狂暴的波动。触发激增的法术被完全否定，其能量反而转化为狂暴的激增（见表2）。由于护盾不再起作用，之前被保护的巫师会受到这个狂暴浪潮的全部影响。",
	"This spell is used primarily against hostile spellcasters. It distorts all attempts at spellcasting, converting spell energy into wild surges.": "这个法术主要用于对付敌对的施法者。它扭曲了所有的施法尝试，将法术能量转化为疯狂的涌动。",
	"The victim of a wildstrike is allowed a Intelligence saving throw; if successful, the spell has no effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target is enclosed within a field of wild magic. If the victim casts spells or uses a charge from a magical item, a wild surge is automatically created (refer to {@table wild magic|wldm| Table}). When determining the effects of this surge, the true level of the wild mage who cast the wildstrike is subtracted from the die roll, making the effects of the wild surge more likely to affect the victim.": "野性打击的受害者被允许进行智力救赎，如果成功，咒语没有效果。如果蓄力失败，目标会被包围在一个野性的魔法场中。如果受害者施展法术或使用魔法物品的冲锋，就会自动产生一个野性冲击（参考（%0%））。在确定这个激增的效果时，施放野性冲击的野性法师的真实等级会从掷骰子中减去，使野性激增的效果更容易影响到受害者。",
	"With each Wild Surge generated the Wild Mage must make a concentration check.": "每产生一次野性涌动，野性法师必须进行一次注意力检查。",
	"This spell is similar in effect to wildstrike and wildzone. When cast, a wall of faint, multi-colored lights springs into existence at the point indicated by the caster. These lights form a line 150 feet long. After the first round of the spell, the wizard can move the wall of lights. Each round, the caster can move the wall in the same direction or as much as 45 degrees to either side. Once the wall is set in motion, it cannot be stopped unless the spell is cancelled or dispelled. The lights can move 60 feet per round.": "这个法术的效果类似于野战和野区。当施法时，在施法者指定的地点涌现出一堵微弱的、多色的光线。这些光形成一条150英尺长的线。在施法的第一轮后，巫师可以移动光墙。每一轮，施法者都可以在同一方向或向两侧移动多达45度的墙。一旦光墙开始运动，它就无法停止，除非法术被取消或驱散。灯光每回合可以移动60英尺。",
	"The wildwind has two significant effects. First, all creatures struck by the magical lights suffer {@dice 2d6} points of force damage. Second, any spellcaster struck while concentrating or casting a spell automatically triggers a wild surge (use {@table Wild Magic 2|wldm|Table 2}). Magical items that expend charges that touch the wall of lights automatically release one charge at the casting and again if the Magic item remains during at then end of its wielder's turn or whenever they come into contact again, also resulting in a wild surge.": "野风有两个显著的效果。首先，所有被魔光击中的生物都会受到（%0%）点武力伤害。其次，任何施法者在集中精力或施法时被击中，会自动触发狂风（使用（%1%））。消耗电荷的魔法物品接触到光墙时，会在施法时自动释放一个电荷，如果魔法物品在施法者的回合结束时仍在，或在他们再次接触时再次释放电荷，也会导致狂涌。",
	"This powerful spell creates a disruption in magical forces similar to the conditions found in wild magic regions (areas where the effects of magic have been permanently altered). This spell has only a temporary effect, although the effects of wildzone could possibly be rendered permanent.": "这个强大的法术创造了一个类似于野生魔法区（魔法效果被永久改变的区域）中发现的条件的魔法力量的破坏。这个法术只有暂时的效果，尽管野生区的效果有可能变成永久性的。",
	"The spell creates a wild magic region centered on the caster. The area of effect cannot be shaped in any way; it is always a square 300 feet long on each side (90,000 square feet).": "该法术以施法者为中心创造一个野生的魔法区域。效果区域不能以任何方式被塑造，它始终是一个每边长300英尺的正方形（90000平方英尺）。",
	"Within the wildzone, wild magic reigns. Any spell cast in the area of effect is automatically treated as a wild surge (see {@table wild magic surge|phb|Table}). Effects from magical items that expend charges are also treated as wild surges when used in the area. Other magical items function normally. Spells cast into the wildzone from outside the area of effect function normally, but spells cannot be cast out of the area of effect without triggering a wild surge.": "在野区内，野性的魔法统治着。任何在效果区域内施放的法术都会被自动视为野性涌动（见（%0%））。当在该区域内使用时，来自消耗电荷的魔法物品的效果也会被视为野性激增。其他魔法物品的功能正常。从效果区外施放到野区的法术正常运作，但如果不触发野性涌动，则不能在效果区外施放法术。",
	"This spell is the wild mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.": "这个咒语是野性法师的终极最后手段。施放时，法师会突然释放大量的野生魔法能量，希望能抓住这些能量并将其塑造成所需的法术效果。这种尝试通常会失败，但在这个过程中几乎总会发生一些事情。",
	"Before casting the spell, the mage announces the spell effect he is trying to create. The mage must be able to cast the spell (i.e., have it in his spell book), but need not have the tier for the spell slot available. After announcing the spell (along with the target and any other conditions required by the spell), the wild mage casts Nahal's reckless dweomer. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is rolled randomly on Wild Surge Results.": "在施法之前，法师要宣布他要创造的法术效果。法师必须能够施展该法术（即在他的法术书中有该法术），但不需要有该法术槽的等级。在宣布咒语（以及目标和咒语所要求的任何其他条件）后，野性法师施放纳哈勒的鲁莽威玛。一阵魔法能量被释放出来，野生法师试图将其操纵成所需的形式。咒语的实际效果在野性突发结果中随机滚动。",
	"Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, their level may be added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected.  The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting Nahal's reckless dweomer.": "因为能量的释放是由法师计划的，他们的等级可以加到掷骰子上。如果结果显示成功，法师就将魔法能量塑造成了所需的效果。更多时候，效果是完全出乎意料的。 结果可能对法师有利，也可能完全是灾难性的；这就是法师在施放纳哈勒的鲁莽德威姆时所冒的风险。",
