	"In the cold forests of Keefe, the people know of the magic found in the bones of the recently deceased. With enough patience and skill, this magic can be extracted and used by living creatures. This knowledge has spread beyond the borders of the northern continent, and has taken root in many societies. Through the art of scrimshaw, a bonecarver can use this magical essence thought lost in death, finding power in the picked bones of a dead animal.": "在基辅寒冷的森林里，人们知道在刚去世的人的骨头里发现了魔法。只要有足够的耐心和技巧，这种魔法可以被提取出来，并被活的生物使用。这种知识已经传播到北方大陆的边界之外，并在许多社会中扎根。通过雕刻艺术，刻骨匠可以利用这种被认为在死亡中失去的魔法精华，在死去的动物的骨头上找到力量。",

You also gain proficiency with {@item Woodcarver's Tools|phb}, which you use when you craft your {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}. You know how to craft all the listed {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}, but you may only craft a certain number at any given time, as detailed by this feature.": "当在3级时选择这个协约，你就能通过骨雕艺术，也就是所谓的骨雕，用不同种类的骨头制作（%0%）。每天一次，你可以花一个短暂的休息时间来制作你所选择的两个（%1%），赋予它们的守护者以特殊的好处。{@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}会在8小时内保持有效，或直到它们破裂。如果受到任何直接攻击，{@filter talisman|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}就会断裂，而且它的攻击力为10+你的灵巧修正值。你也获得了对（%4%）的熟练度，你在制作（%5%）时使用它。你知道如何制作所有列出的（%6%），但你在任何时候都只能制作一定数量的东西，详见此特征。",
	"Upon reaching 7th level in this class, you may craft 3 {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn} during the daily short rest and all of these stay in effect. At 15th level, this number increases to 4. You can wear your own {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}, and a person can wear multiple {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}, but not two of the same kind.

	"Also at 3rd level, you are able to gather information about the origins of bones. By studying and looking over the corpse or bones of a dead creature over a 10 minute period, you can discern how the creature died, how long ago it died, and what type of creature it was.": "同样在第三级，你能够收集关于骨头来源的信息。通过在10分钟内研究和观察一个死去的生物的尸体或骨头，你可以分辨出这个生物是怎么死的，多久以前死的，以及它是什么类型的生物。",
	"Starting at 7th level, your {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn} are imbued with uncanny power, keeping wicked spirits and ill endings at bay. While in possession of a {@filter talisman|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}, the keeper has advantage on death saving throws and saving throws against being possessed. The first time the keeper puts on a {@filter talisman|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}, they gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier. If they put on multiple {@filter talismans|optionalfeatures|feature type=tlsmn}, the effect happens multiple times.

	"Beginning at 11th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack you may try to shatter one of their bones, assuming they have any.

	"While doing the ritual, your senses are replaced with that of the creature, and you become blind to the world around you as you step into the creature's mind. You see the last 10 minutes of the creature's life play out in front of you. You are able to see, hear, smell, and feel whatever the creature did, but you do not gain its memories. This means that if you find that a person was murdered, you can see the identity of the killer, but you do not know if the dead person knew the killer or not.": "在做这个仪式时，你的感官被替换成生物的感官，当你进入生物的头脑时，你对周围的世界变得盲目。你看到那个生物的最后10分钟在你面前上演。你能够看到、听到、闻到和感觉到这个生物所做的一切，但你不会获得它的记忆。这意味着，如果你发现一个人被谋杀了，你可以看到凶手的身份，但你不知道死者是否认识凶手。",
