	"The druids of the circle of the root and stem revere trees and plants above all, identifying them as the foundation upon which all of nature's glory is built. These druids tend to vast and beautiful woodlands, taking painstaking, personal care of every single plant that grows within. The circle's most powerful druids strive to become trees themselves, using their divine magic to transform their bodies into rugged towers of bark and leaf, the better to guard their sacred forests.": "根茎圈的德鲁伊们最崇尚树木和植物，认为它们是所有自然界的荣耀所建立的基础。这些德鲁伊照料着广阔而美丽的林地，对生长在其中的每一株植物进行精心的个人护理。圈子里最强大的德鲁伊们努力使自己成为树木，用他们的神力将自己的身体变成由树皮和树叶组成的坚固的塔，以更好地守护他们的神圣森林。",

	"Also at 2nd level, your skin takes on a rough, bark-like appearance, studded with sharp thorns. Your AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing.

These effects apply while you are Wildshaped.": "同样在2级时，你的皮肤会呈现出粗糙的、像树皮一样的外观，上面布满了尖锐的刺。无论你穿着什么样的盔甲，你的AC都不能低于16。另外，每当你被近战武器攻击击中时，你可以用你的反应对攻击者造成1d4加你智慧修饰的穿刺伤害。这些效果在你处于 \"野性 \"状态时适用。",

	"At 10th level, your connection to the magic of the earth is so strong that you gain a measure of its solidity.

You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.": "在10级时，你与大地的魔力的联系是如此强烈，以至于你获得了某种程度上的稳固性。只要你的脚在自然地面上，你就不会被推、搡、撞倒或受到任何其他形式的非自愿运动。你在力量检查和力量投掷方面也有优势。",
	"By 14th level, you have finally learned to become a tree. You can now use your Wild Shape to transform into an awakened tree, or you can expend two uses of your Wildshape to transform into a treant. While in this form, you add your Wisdom modifier to damage rolls for your slam attack, which is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity.": "到了14级，你终于学会了变成一棵树。你现在可以使用你的 \"野性之形 \"变身为一棵觉醒的树，或者你可以消耗两次 \"野性之形 \"来变身为一棵树。在这种形态下，你在猛击的伤害卷上加上你的智慧修饰，为了克服抵抗和免疫的目的，这被认为是神奇的。"
