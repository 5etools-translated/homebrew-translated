	"You've learnt to fight dirty whenever you can, and that villainy- for better or worse - can open more doors than it closes, Yours is a walk oflife shared by Thieves' Guild enforcers, untrained brawlers, highwaymen, crooked mercenaries, and anyone incorrigible or desperate enough to think that enemy groins are ideal targets for assault. Quick thinking, versatility in action, and utter ruthlessness help you to shine in a skirmish, as well as corral strangers in the social world.": "你已经学会了在任何时候都要进行肮脏的斗争，而恶棍--无论好坏--可以打开更多的门，你是盗贼公会的执法者、未经训练的斗士、公路杀手、邪恶的雇佣兵，以及任何不可救药或绝望到认为敌人的腹股沟是理想的攻击目标的人所共有的生活方式。敏捷的思维、多变的行动和彻底的无情帮助你在小规模战斗中大放异彩，并在社交世界中笼络陌生人。",
	"Starting when you select this archetype at 3rd level, your wherewithal leaves you ever-ready for trouble. You can't be surprised while conscious, and gain proficiency with improvised weapons.

	"Also at 3rd level, you abandon your scruples and double down on scrappiness. Whenever you land a Sneak Attack on a creature within 5 feet of you, you can activate a Dirty Tactic, which are listed under \"Dirty Tactics\" below, before rolling for damage, To do so, you must forgo rolling a certain number of your Sneak Attack dice (based on the Dirty Tactic chosen), after which any remaining d6s are rolled for damage.": "同样在第三级，你放弃了你的顾虑，而加倍努力地工作。每当你对周围5英尺内的生物进行偷袭时，你可以在滚动伤害前激活一个肮脏战术，这些战术在下面的 \"肮脏战术 \"中列出，要做到这一点，你必须放弃滚动一定数量的偷袭骰子（基于所选择的肮脏战术），然后再滚动任何剩余的d6s以获得伤害。",

	"You can only use Dirty Tactics with costs that don't exceed the number of d6s you'd normally roll for a Sneak Attack.

	"Your Dirty Tactics may force a creature to make a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:": "你的 \"肮脏战术 \"可能会迫使一个生物做一个拯救动作。救赎动作的计算方法如下。",
	"At 9th level, you develop a flair for exploiting the panicked and the powerless. You can now use your Sneak Attack against {@condition frightened} creatures without having advantage on your attack rolls.": "9级时，你发展出一种利用惊慌失措和无能为力的人的天赋。你现在可以对（%0%）的生物使用你的偷袭，而在你的攻击卷上没有优势。",
	"In addition, using your Cunning Action, you can make a Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check contested by the Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check of a creature within 30 feet of you.

	"From 13th level, you more quickly adapt to strategies you didn't initially outsmart. After failing a saving throw caused by a creature, you have advantage on the next saving throw of the same ability score caused by that creature. You cannot benefit from this feature against the same creature more than once per short or long rest.": "从13级开始，你能更快地适应你最初没有想到的策略。在一个生物造成的蓄力失败后，你在下一次由该生物造成的相同能力分数的蓄力上有优势。在每次短时或长时休息中，你对同一生物不能从这一特性中获益超过一次。",
	"By 17th level, you have mastered every dirty trick in the book. If a creature succeeds on its saving throw against one of your Dirty Tactics, you can recover the d6s you spent to activate it. When you do so, you can use another Dirty Tactic as part of your current action or reaction, or roll the d6s for Sneak Attack damage.": "到17级时，你已经掌握了书中所有的肮脏战术。如果一个生物对你的一个肮脏战术的救赎成功，你可以恢复你用来激活它的d6s。当你这样做的时候，你可以使用另一个肮脏战术作为你当前行动或反应的一部分，或者将这6个骰子用于偷袭伤害。",

	"You forgo a direct assault and try to cause a creature greater longterm harm, leaving it bleeding for 1 minute or until it is healed magically. At the start of each of its turns while bleeding, the target's maximum and current hit points decrease by 1 due to blood loss. By succeeding on a Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check against your Dirty Tactic DC as an action, the target or one of its allies can stem this bleeding.": "你放弃直接攻击，试图给一个生物造成更大的长期伤害，让它流血1分钟或直到它被魔法治愈。在流血期间的每个回合开始时，目标的最大和当前命中率会因为失血而减少1。通过对你的肮脏战术DC进行智慧（（%0%））检定成功，作为一个行动，目标或它的一个盟友可以阻止这种流血。",

On a failed save, it has disadvantage on its attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.": "你试图通过猥亵的行为激怒一个生物（例如向它吐口水）来引起它的愤怒，迫使它做一个智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，它在对你以外的生物进行攻击时将处于劣势，直到你下一个回合开始。",

	"You attempt to cripple a creature, forcing it to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop whatever it's holding in an appendage of your choice. The target cannot use that appendage in any way until the end of its next turn.": "你试图削弱一个生物的能力，迫使它在宪法规定的投掷中获得成功，或者在你选择的附属物中放下它所持有的东西。目标不能以任何方式使用该附属物，直到其下一回合结束。",
