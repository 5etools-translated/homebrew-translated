	"Those who follow this oath may initially seem to be lawless tricksters and liars, but their behaviour is all but random or malicious. Sometimes known as faerie knights, Knights of the Court and fey knights (much to the chagrin of certain other paladins), these paladins are bound by the strange rules of the Fey. They dedicate themselves to serving these otherworldly masters, swearing to uphold their laws, principles, and ideals a world away from their hidden realms and carrying out their will. Often, these paladins can be found as elite warriors serving in the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, or guarding valuable portals to and from the Feywild, but the nature of their masters means they can be found anywhere on the Material Plane. Their appearance varies, but each carries the iconography of their master on their person, whether it be worked into their armour or emblazoned on an amulet.": "那些遵循这一誓言的人最初可能看起来是无法无天的诡计和骗子，但他们的行为都是随意或恶意的。有时被称为精灵骑士、宫廷骑士和费伊骑士（令某些其他圣骑士感到懊恼），这些圣骑士受费伊人的奇怪规则约束。他们献身于为这些异世界的主人服务，发誓维护他们的法律、原则和理想，远离他们的隐秘领域，执行他们的意志。通常情况下，这些圣骑士可以作为精英战士在塞利和非塞利法院服务，或守卫进出费城的宝贵门户，但他们的主人的性质意味着他们可以在物质世界的任何地方找到。他们的外表各不相同，但每个人身上都带着他们主人的图腾，无论是在他们的盔甲上还是在护身符上都有印记。",

	"Starting at 7th, you can create illusions to beguile your foes. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can create an illusory copy of yourself in your space. While the illusion is present, attacks made against you have disadvantage. When a creature misses you with a melee attack, the illusion lashes out, dealing psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier to the creature. The illusion lasts until the start of your next turn, or until it deals damage.": "从第七级开始，你可以创造幻象来迷惑你的敌人。每回合一次，当你用近战攻击击中一个生物时，你可以在你的空间里创造一个你自己的幻象。当幻象存在时，对你进行的攻击是不利的。当一个生物用近战攻击打不中你时，幻象就会猛烈攻击，对该生物造成相当于你的魅力修正值的精神伤害。幻象持续到你下一回合开始，或直到它造成伤害。",
