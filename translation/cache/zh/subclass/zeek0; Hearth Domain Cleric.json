	"In a home the hearth is the center of the household, holding the fire which is used for heat, food, and light. It is symbolic of the power to hold the wilds and darkness at bay and the family within. The gods of hearth are concerned with protection of family and the sanctity of home. These gods such as Hestia, Bes, Mishakal, Boldrei, Yondalla, and Hathor are seldom well-known in their pantheons. But while there are few stories about them, they hold a small shrine in most every household. Clerics are rarely called to conflict by gods of hearth, but when they are there is usually something greater at stake than soldiers, heroes, and kings.": "在一个家庭中，炉灶是家庭的中心，拥有用于取暖、食物和照明的火。它象征着将荒野和黑暗挡在门外的力量和家庭的力量。壁炉之神关注的是对家庭的保护和家庭的神圣性。这些神，如赫斯提亚、贝斯、米沙卡、波德雷、永达拉和哈托尔，在他们的万神殿中很少为人所知。但是，虽然关于他们的故事很少，但他们在大多数家庭中都拥有一个小神龛。教士们很少被神灵召唤去参加冲突，但当他们被召唤时，通常会有比士兵、英雄和国王更重要的事。",

That creature gains resistance to one damage type of your choice until the beginning of your next turn.": "一级时，你给予盟友的恩惠会暂时提供额外的保护。当你施展影响一个或多个生物的法术时，你可以选择一个受该法术影响的生物。该生物获得对你所选择的一种伤害类型的抗性，直到你下一回合开始。",

	"When a creature you can see within the light of the hearthflame fails a saving throw, you can use a reaction to intervene with the hearthflame's power. You immediately make a Wisdom saving throw, and you can choose to replace the result of the failed saving throw with the result of that roll.

After you intervene three times, the hearthflame is extinguished.": "当你在炉火之光中看到的生物不能进行蓄力投掷时，你可以使用反应来干预炉火的力量。你立即进行智慧救赎，并且你可以选择用该掷骰子的结果取代救赎失败的结果。之后，炉火的暗光和亮光的半径各减少10英尺（总共20英尺）。在你干预了三次之后，炉火就会熄灭。",
