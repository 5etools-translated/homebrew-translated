	"A simple blacksmith raises his hammer above the glowing-hot steel. It strikes once. Twice. He lifts it a third, and holds it in his grasp as he studies the steel. As if in anticipation, the hammer begins to quake with holy force and he brings it down again and again, his divine strength aiding his work.": "一个简单的铁匠将他的锤子举到炽热的钢铁之上。它敲击一次。两次。他第三次举起锤子，并在研究钢铁时将其握在手中。仿佛是在期待，铁锤开始以神圣的力量颤抖，他一次又一次地把它放下，他的神圣力量帮助了他的工作。",
	"A half-elf clad in common clothes watches her friend prepare alchemical mixtures, combining the contents of distilled vials into one another before letting loose a shriek as the concoction erupts before her. Looking on the failed works of her friend, the half-elf pats her back with a smile. \"It is alright,\" she speaks, \"try once more, sister. Your work is of the utmost importance.\"": "一个穿着普通衣服的半精灵看着她的朋友准备炼金混合物，把蒸馏瓶里的东西互相结合起来，然后在她面前爆发出一声惊叫。看着她朋友失败的作品，半精灵微笑着拍拍她的背。\"没关系，\"她说，\"再试一次，妹妹。你的工作是最重要的。\"",

	"The Oath of the Common Man is born of togetherness, mutual suffering, and righteous indignation at those who would put their boot heel to the collective neck of the worst-off in society. When a greedy baron levies unfair taxes that cut the poor to the bone, when a pompous dragon ransacks the countryside to build his own personal hoard, when a bloodthirsty tyrant forces the poor into conscripted service in his armies, to fight and die on the frontlines, the paladin of the Common Man will be there with the fury of the oppressed at their back, with thunder in their voice and fire in their eyes, and the will of the people behind their every word and action. To a paladin of the Common Man, tyrants and avaricious industrialists are worse than any fiend, and they must be thrown down, their schemes bent and broken, before the might of those they sought to keep beneath them.": "普通人的誓言源于团结，源于共同的苦难，源于对那些将靴子跟放在社会上最贫困者的集体脖子上的人的义愤填膺。当贪婪的男爵征收不公平的税款，将穷人压得喘不过气来时，当浮夸的巨龙洗劫乡村以建立自己的个人囤积物时，当嗜血的暴君强迫穷人应征入伍，在前线战斗和牺牲时，普通人的圣骑士将背负着被压迫者的愤怒，声音如雷，眼神如火，一言一行背后都是人民的意志。对普通人的圣骑士来说，暴君和贪婪的工业家比任何恶魔都要坏，他们必须被打倒，他们的计划被打乱，在他们试图压制他们的人的力量面前被打倒。",
	"Paladins of the Common Man always wear armor and clothing that is simple, un-ornate, but well-cared for and kept up with the labor and dedication that comes only from earnest devotion.": "普通人的圣骑士总是穿着简单、不华丽的盔甲和衣服，但却得到了很好的照顾，并在劳动和奉献中保持着认真的态度。",
	"The tenets that a paladin of the Common Man obeys vary wildly from individual from individual, but all carry within them the same revolutionary spirit, the single idea that the change the world needs to break free from tyranny is destined to happen, but much work needs to be done alongside every common man and woman to bring this collective dream to fruition. A paladin of the Common man thus roughly upholds the following tenets:": "普通人的圣骑士所遵守的信条因人而异，但都带有相同的革命精神，即世界摆脱暴政所需的变革注定要发生，但要实现这一集体梦想，需要与每个普通人一起做很多工作。因此，一个普通人的圣骑士大致上坚持以下信条。",
	"All creatures are inherently equal, and those that deny this fact for their own gain do the common man harm.": "所有生物在本质上都是平等的，那些为了自己的利益而否认这一事实的人对普通人是一种伤害。",

Either you are considered to be aided by the {@action Help} action from an unseen or indistinct source for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), or one friendly creature within 30 feet of you that you choose (including yourself) gains proficiency with a specific type of {@item artisan's tools|phb} for one hour.": "作为一个行动，你用响亮的声音释放一个团结的信息，呼唤那些在压迫中死去的普通劳工的灵魂来援助你，或另一个人。要么你被认为从一个看不见的或不清楚的来源得到了（%0%）行动的帮助，回合数等于你的魅力修改器（最小为1），要么你选择的30英尺内的一个友好生物（包括你自己）获得对特定类型（%1%）的熟练度，持续一小时。",
	"Those that hold themselves a class above the common working man must be brought down and made to fear the peasantry. As an action, you utter an indictment against those who would trample the rights of laborers, inspiring the same terror in them that they inflict on those they hold as lessers. Any fey, non-chaotic fiend, or dragon that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. At your DM's discretion, aristocratic humanoids and undead may also be affected by this ability, so long as they are intelligent and unsympathetic to the plight of the lower classes.": "那些认为自己是高于普通劳动者的阶级的人必须被打倒，让他们害怕农民。作为一项行动，你对那些践踏劳动者权利的人提出控诉，在他们身上激发出与他们对那些被他们视为下等人的人一样的恐怖。在你周围30英尺范围内，任何能看到或听到你的精灵、非混沌魔物或龙，都必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果该生物没有完成蓄力，它就会在1分钟内转向，或者直到它受到伤害。根据DM的判断，贵族人形生物和亡灵也可以受到这个能力的影响，只要它们是聪明的并且不同情下层人的困境。",
	"A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the {@action Dash} action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there is nowhere to move, the creature can use the {@action Dodge} action.": "一个被转化的生物必须花它的回合试图尽可能地远离你，而且它不能自愿地移动到离你30英尺以内的空间。它也不能做出反应。对于它的行动，它只能使用（%0%）的行动或试图从阻止它移动的效果中逃脱。如果没有地方可以移动，该生物可以使用（%1%）动作。",
	"Beginning at 7th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you may choose to instead divide that damage evenly between all willing friendly targets within this aura, rounding up fractions to nearest whole point. As an example: If there are 3 friendly creatures in this aura (yourself included) and one takes 20 hit points of damage, you may choose to have all three friendly creautres (so long as they are willing) take 7 hitpoints of damage instead.": "从第七级开始，每当你或你身边10英尺内的友好生物受到伤害时，你可以选择将该伤害平均分配给该光环内所有自愿的友好目标，将分数四舍五入到最近的整点。举例来说。如果这个光环里有3个友好的生物（包括你自己），其中一个受到了20点伤害，你可以选择让所有三个友好的克里奥特（只要他们愿意）都受到7点伤害。",
