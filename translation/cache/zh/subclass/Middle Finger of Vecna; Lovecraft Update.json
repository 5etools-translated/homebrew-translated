	"In the middle of the night, you hear the music. Every time, it begins the same way, rising from a low drone into a deafening cacophony. The noise is maddening. In your waking hours, your fingers learn to imitate this melody and bring others to your level of psychosis.": "在半夜里，你听到了音乐。每一次，它都以同样的方式开始，从低沉的噪音上升到震耳欲聋的喧闹声。这种噪音让人发疯。在你清醒的时候，你的手指学会了模仿这种旋律，并把别人带到你的精神病水平。",
	"Some attribute the dreadful nightmares to a curse or stress, but you know better.

You know not what.": "有些人把可怕的噩梦归因于诅咒或压力，但你更清楚。你和其他像你一样的人每晚都被卑鄙的鼓声和被诅咒的笛子单调的呜咽声所召唤，这是一个疯狂的神的声音，他呼应着宇宙的混乱，并召唤你去做一些事情。你不知道是什么。",

	"At 3rd level, you can play an insane tune that anguishes creatures that hear it. As an action, choose a creature within 30 feet that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save. You can expend a number of Bardic Inspiration dice to increase this damage by the amount rolled. A deafened creature is immune to this effect.": "在3级时，你可以演奏一种疯狂的曲子，使听到它的生物感到痛苦。作为一个动作，在30英尺范围内选择一个你能看到的生物。该生物必须进行智慧救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到2d6的精神伤害。你可以消耗一定数量的吟游诗人的灵感骰子来增加这个伤害的数量。失聪的生物对这个效果是免疫的。",

	"You are descendant from a foul creature, and its blood wreaks havoc in your family tree. Those in your House are rarely and seemingly at random born hideous, and with terrifying powers, and as such, generation after generation has committed infanticide on the abominations.

Yet your power grows, as fearsome as your aspect and as dreadful as your glare.": "你是一个肮脏生物的后裔，它的血液在你的家谱中肆意破坏。你们家族中的人很少，而且似乎是随机出生的，面目狰狞，拥有可怕的力量，因此，一代又一代的人对可憎的人实施杀婴。你就是这样一个怪物，一出生就被诅咒，却被你的母亲免于一刀，自由地度过你悲惨的生存期，成为脱离社会的怪胎。然而，你的力量在增长，像你的外表一样可怕，像你的目光一样可怕。",

	"At 1st level, your appearance is hideous to behold. You may add double your proficiency bonus to {@skill Intimidation} checks, but you have disadvantage on {@skill Persuasion} checks. Unless you wear a large cloak to conceal these deformities, you are disturbing to behold.": "在1级的时候，你的外表是可怕的。你可以在{@skill Intimidation}检查中加入双倍的熟练度加成，但在{@skill Persuasion}检查中你有劣势。除非你穿了一件大斗篷来掩盖这些畸形，否则你会让人看了很不安。",
	"At 6th level, your arms elongate, allowing you to touch the floor with your hands. In addition, you can bend them in strange and unnatural ways. Your reach increases by 5 feet. Your elongated arms also gives you advantage on Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks made to climb.": "在第6级时，你的手臂会拉长，允许你用手触地。此外，你可以用奇怪的、不自然的方式弯曲它们。你的臂力增加了5英尺。你拉长的手臂也使你在攀爬时的力量（（%0%））检查中获得优势。",
	"At 6th level, you can grow long, whipping tendrils that sprout grotesquely from your form as a bonus action expending 2 sorcery points which last for 1 round.

Each round you begin in this form, you expend 3 additional sorcery points.": "在18级时，作为一个消耗3点巫术点数的额外行动，你可以从你的身体中释放出你的畸形遗产，变成一个可怕的生物。在你使用你的额外行动结束这个效果之前，你对穿刺、砍击和重击伤害有抵抗力，但不能施展1级以上的法术。每当你以这种形态开始时，你会额外消耗3点巫术点数。",
	"In addition, creatures who look upon this form become frozen in horror. Each creature that can see you within 30 feet, except for allies which know to avert their gaze, must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition paralyzed} while you are transformed. At the end of each of its turns, affected creatures can repeat this saving throw. A creature that succeeds this save is immune to this effect for 24 hours.": "此外，看到这种形态的生物会被吓得呆住。每个在30英尺范围内能看到你的生物，除了知道转移视线的盟友，都必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物在你变身的时候会有（%0%）的伤害。在它的每个回合结束时，受影响的生物可以重复这个蓄力动作。拯救成功的生物在24小时内对该效果免疫。",
	"Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before using it again.": "一旦你使用这个能力，在再次使用之前，你必须完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Keepers encounter the Elder Sign in a multitude of ways. Some find it in the derelict pages of an antediluvian tome, yet others see its shape in their very dreams. All who gaze upon it know its authority, as instinctively as animals know to fear fire; it is an icon of power originating from beyond the veil of reality, one that no men were meant to know. You have sworn to hold the sign as its Keeper, and vowed to protect the mortal realm from the forces beyond, or vowed to tear reality asunder, and let the Elder Evils henceforth seep through.": "守护者以多种方式接触到长老标志。有些人在前世的书页中发现了它，有些人则在梦中看到它的形状。所有注视它的人都知道它的权威，就像动物知道害怕火一样的本能；它是一个来自现实面纱之外的力量的标志，一个没有人注定会知道的标志。你已经发誓作为它的守护者持有这个标志，并发誓保护凡人的境界不受外界力量的影响，或者发誓撕裂现实，让上古邪魔从此渗入。",
	"The principles held by the Keepers of the Elder sign are as esoteric as their ancient order. Dedicated to the secrets of the universe and the keeping them mercifully hidden from the world, the Keepers are a clandestine and influential organization.": "守护者的原则与他们的古老秩序一样深奥。守护者致力于研究宇宙的秘密，并将其仁慈地隐藏起来，是一个秘密的、有影响力的组织。",
	"The Elder Sign is a tool of immense power, and must be kept safe. You can scarcely understand the source of power contained in this mere piece of geometry, but you know it can never be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.": "长老牌是一种具有巨大力量的工具，必须加以保护。你几乎无法理解这块单纯的几何图形所包含的力量来源，但你知道绝对不能让它落入坏人手中。",
	"Whenever possible, you should seek out and acquire hidden, esoteric knowledge. You are drawn to such secrets, like the Elder Sign, and perhaps can turn them against your foes.": "只要有可能，你就应该寻找并获得隐藏的、深奥的知识。你会被这种秘密所吸引，就像长生牌一样，也许可以用它们来对付你的敌人。",
	"It is imperative the struggles you face are kept secret. The forces are work here are barely comprehensible, and their reveal can drive men to the brink of madness.": "当务之急是对你所面临的斗争保密。这里的力量几乎无法理解，它们的暴露会使人陷入疯狂的边缘。",

	"As an action, you can fleetingly create the form of the Elder Sign, a powerful symbol which can strengthen or wear thin the walls of reality. Choose a space adjacent to you, which is where the sign burns brightly for 1 minute in a 20-foot radius sphere. No darkness, magical or otherwise, can obscure this area. Each creature friendly to you in this area gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and gains a +1 bonus to armor class. No outsider, an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, can enter or teleport within this area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. Those that are already in this area are shunted to the nearest space available. As such, Elder Signs are often placed in front of gates to the Far Realm, to close leaks into that reality.": "作为一个行动，你可以短暂地创造出长老标志的形态，这是一个强大的符号，可以加强或消减现实的墙壁。选择一个与你相邻的空间，这是标志在20英尺半径的球体中明亮地燃烧1分钟。任何黑暗，不管是魔法还是其他，都无法遮蔽这个区域。在这个区域内，每个对你友好的生物在攻击和伤害卷上获得+1的奖励，并获得+1的装甲等级奖励。任何外来者、异形、天人、元素、精灵或魔鬼，都不能进入或传送到这个区域内，也不能使用门户，比如那些由大门法术创造的门户，来进入这个区域。那些已经在这个区域的人则被分流到最近的可用空间。因此，长老标志经常被放置在通往远界的门前，以关闭进入该现实的漏洞。",
	"Alternatively, when you use this ability, you can choose to Invert the Elder Sign. Doing so casts {@spell hunger of hadar} for one minute centered on the sign. You take no damage from this spell on the round it is cast.": "或者，当你使用这个能力时，你可以选择颠倒长老的标志。这样做会在一分钟内以标志为中心施放（%0%）。你在施法的回合中不会受到这个法术的伤害。",

	"By 15th level, your research in musty, forbidden tomes has proven fruitful. As an action, you can utter a word used in the creation of the universe. All magic effects within 15 feet of you are targeted by {@spell dispel magic}. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.": "到了15级，你对发霉的、禁忌的书籍的研究已经被证明是富有成效的。作为一个行动，你可以说出一个用于创造宇宙的词。在你周围15英尺范围内的所有魔法效果都会以（%0%）为目标。使用这个能力后，你不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"At 20th level, you can call upon the Elder Sign to tear the very fabric of reality, creating a one-way rift to or from the Far Realm for 1 minute. Choose an unoccupied 5-foot radius sphere that you can see and whether this portal should lead to, or come from the Far Realm. Creatures that end their turn within 30' of the sphere are inexplicably moved 5 feet toward it, as if pulled by an unseen force. If the portal leads to the Far Realm, creatures that enter it are flung to the far reaches of space, taking 8d10 psychic damage from the horrors they witness and are ejected from the far side of the portal 1 round later. If the portal leads from the Far Realm, creatures adjacent to it are restrained by tentacles, claws, or other monstrous appendages that reach through it. Creatures so restrained can break free as an action by making a Strength saving throw. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.": "在20级时，你可以呼唤长老标志来撕裂现实的结构，创造一个单向的裂缝来往于远界，持续1分钟。选择一个你能看到的半径为5英尺的空地，以及这个入口是通往远界，还是来自远界。在球体30英尺范围内结束其回合的生物会莫名其妙地朝它移动5英尺，就像被一种看不见的力量所牵引。如果传送门通向远界，进入它的生物会被甩到遥远的空间，从他们目睹的恐怖中受到8d10的精神伤害，并在1轮后被弹出传送门的远端。如果传送门来自远界，与之相邻的生物会被触手、爪子或其他伸入传送门的畸形附属物所限制。被束缚的生物可以在行动中挣脱，方法是做一个力量救赎动作。在使用这个能力后，你不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Druids of an Unspeakable Circle are abominations to the natural world. Whereas normal druids venerate nature and assume the shape of beasts, Unspeakable druids can transform into creatures originating from terrifying remote regions of time and space. As they grow in power and influence, the other form further mutates from comprehensible physical bodies and becomes more deadly and bizarre. The Masters of this circle transform into hideous monstrosities, unrecognizable as creatures from our own reality.": "不言之教的德鲁伊是对自然界的憎恶。普通的德鲁伊崇尚自然，并呈现出野兽的形状，而不可言说的德鲁伊可以转化为源自恐怖的遥远时空区域的生物。随着他们力量和影响力的增长，另一种形式进一步从可理解的肉体中变异出来，变得更加致命和诡异。这个圈子的大师们变身为狰狞的怪兽，无法认出是我们自己现实中的生物。",
	"When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use {@class druid|phb|Wild Shape|druid||Wild Shape 2} on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action, however, you lose the ability to assume the shape of a beast. Instead you may use it to take an Aberration Form with a number of additional traits.": "当你在2级时选择这个圈子，你获得了在你的回合中使用（%0%）作为额外行动的能力，而不是作为一个行动，然而你失去了变成野兽形状的能力。相反，你可以使用它来获得一个具有一些额外特征的异化形态。",
