	"Your patron was once a resident of the upper planes, though they are no longer. Cast out by their kin, they have departed from their celestial origins and dabbled in darker magics. Though fallen angels are the most well known patrons of this type, there are many celestials capable of falling from grace. Some warlocks bind themselves with a fallen Empyrean, ki-rin, unicorn, couatl, or other such creature, but fallen angels are by far the most common.": "你的守护者曾经是上层世界的居民，尽管他们不再是了。他们被他们的亲属赶走，离开了他们的天体本源，涉足更黑暗的魔法。虽然堕落天使是这种类型的最知名的赞助人，但也有许多天人能够从优雅中堕落。有些术士将自己与堕落的帝王、麒麟、独角兽、库拉特或其他此类生物结合在一起，但堕落的天使是迄今为止最常见的。",
	"Through your connection with your patron, you gain both holy and unholy powers. It is common for warlocks of the Fallen to be mistaken for Celestial warlocks, as they tend to wield the powers of the divine more often than not. But as combat drags on and a Fallen warlock becomes more desperate, their mind and body transfonn as they unlock their darker powers. Your hair, skin, and eyes might change color, and your personality might change as well, perhaps even drastically. Even an altruistic idealist could become a merciless killer.": "通过你与守护者的联系，你获得了神圣和非神圣的力量。堕落者的术士通常会被误认为是天界的术士，因为他们往往更多的是挥舞着神圣的力量。但随着战斗的持续和堕落的术士变得更加绝望，他们的思想和身体会随着他们释放出更黑暗的力量而转变。你的头发、皮肤和眼睛可能会改变颜色，你的个性也可能会改变，甚至可能会发生巨大的变化。即使是一个利他主义的理想主义者也可能变成一个无情的杀手。",
	"The Fallen lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the Warlock list for you.": "堕落者让你在学习术士法术时从一个扩大的法术列表中选择。以下法术将被添加到术士列表中，供你使用。",
	"At 1st level, your patron gives you two distinct sets of powers: one derived from their celestial heritage, and the other from their evil nature. You gain the following powers:": "一级时，你的守护者给予你两套不同的力量：一套来自他们的天体遗产，另一套来自他们的邪恶本性。你会获得以下力量。",
	" While you have more than or equal to half your hit points left, you gain the powers of the risen. When a friendly creature within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to give it advantage on its next death saving throw and release a blinding light from its body. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of your fallen ally must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be blinded until the start of your next turn.": " 当你剩余的生命值超过或等于一半时，你会获得复活者的力量。当一个在你30英尺范围内的友好生物被降低到0命中率时，你可以用你的反应让它在下一次死亡自救中获得优势，并从它的身体中释放出一道刺眼的光。在你倒下的盟友的10英尺范围内，你选择的每个生物都必须对你的术士法术救赎DC进行宪法救赎成功，否则就会失明，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"While you have less than half your hit points left, you gain the powers of the fallen. When a hostile creature within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to release a menacing aura from its body. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the fallen enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or take 1d4 + half your Warlock level in psychic damage and be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.": "当你的生命值剩下不到一半时，你会获得堕落者的力量。当一个在你30英尺范围内的敌对生物被降低到0命中率时，你可以用你的反应从它的身体上释放一个威胁性的光环。你所选择的每个在倒下的敌人10英尺范围内的生物必须对你的术士法术救赎DC进行智慧救赎成功，否则会受到1d4+你的术士等级一半的精神伤害，并对你感到恐惧，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"Using your bonus action, choose a number no greater than half your hit point maximum. You take necrotic damage equal to the chosen amount, which cannot be reduced through any means, and you store a number of hit points equal to the same amount. As a bonus action, you can consume the stored hit points, allowing you to regain a number of hit points equal to the amount stored. If you still have stored hit points at the end of a short or long rest, those hit points are lost.": "使用你的额外行动，选择一个不超过你最大命中率一半的数字。你会受到与所选数量相等的坏死伤害，该伤害无法通过任何方式减少，并且你会储存与该数量相等的命中点。作为一个额外的动作，你可以消耗储存的命中率，让你重新获得与储存量相等的命中率。如果你在短期或长期休息结束时仍有储存的命中率，那么这些命中率就会丢失。",
	"Starting at 6th level, your link to the Fallen makes you resilient to certain damage types. While you are Risen, you have resistance to radiant damage. While you are Fallen, you have resistance to necrotic damage.": "从6级开始，你与堕落者的联系使你对某些类型的伤害有抵抗力。当你是复活者时，你对辐射伤害有抵抗力。当你是堕落者时，你对坏死性的伤害有抵抗力。",
	"Also, when you take damage from a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically rebuke them. That creature takes damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level. The damage type is radiant if you are Risen, and necrotic if you are Fallen. Once you rebuke a creature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.": "另外，当你受到30英尺范围内的生物的伤害时，你可以用你的反应对其进行魔法斥责。该生物受到的伤害等于你的魅力修改器+你的术士等级。如果你是复活者，伤害类型是辐射型，如果你是堕落者，伤害类型是坏死型。一旦你斥责了一个生物，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"At 10th level, your body changes as you rise and fall. You gain one of the following features, dependent on whether you are Risen or Fallen:": "在10级时，你的身体会随着你的上升和下降而改变。你获得以下特征之一，取决于你是复活还是堕落。",
	"You gain large, angelic wings that grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed. If you lose these wings by falling below half health, you gain the effects of {@spell featherfall} until you touch the ground.": "你获得巨大的天使之翼，赋予你相当于步行速度的飞行速度。如果你因健康状况低于一半而失去这些翅膀，你会获得（%0%）的效果，直到你触地为止。",
	"Your skin becomes unnaturally tough. If your AC isn't already higher, it becomes 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. Additional bonuses cannot be added to this AC calculation.": "你的皮肤变得异常坚韧。如果你的AC值还没有变高，它就会变成10+你的灵巧修改器+你的魅力修改器。额外的奖励不能加到这个AC计算中。",
	"Beginning at 14th level, you can perform great displays of divine power. As an action, you release bolts of energy from your body with different effects based on whether you are Risen or Fallen:": "从14级开始，你可以进行伟大的神力展示。作为一个动作，你可以从你的身体中释放能量，根据你是复活还是堕落而产生不同的效果。",
	"You evoke healing energy that can restore 10d10 hit points. Choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you. You divide these hit points among them.": "你唤起治疗能量，可以恢复10d10的命中率。在你周围30英尺范围内选择任意数量的生物。你将这些命中率分给他们。",
	"You evoke deathly energy that can deal 10d10 necrotic damage. Choose any munber of creatures within 30 feet of you. You divide this damage among them.": "你唤起死亡的能量，可以造成10d10的坏死伤害。选择你周围30英尺内的任何生物群。你把这个伤害分给他们。",
	"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "一旦你使用这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成长时间的休息。"
