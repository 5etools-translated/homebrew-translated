	"Shrouded in a cloak dark as pitch, a female halfling skulks through the night, hiding in the shadows of a sleeping city. She clutches a crescent-moon amulet strung around her neck and exudes a whispering sigh. The halfling's blackened chain link armor makes not a sound, and she skirts undetected past a trio of patrolling guards with preternatural ease.": "笼罩在漆黑的斗篷中，一个女性半身人在夜里溜达，躲在沉睡的城市的阴影里。她紧握着挂在脖子上的新月形护身符，发出低声的叹息。半身人发黑的链式盔甲没有发出任何声音，她以超自然的速度从三个巡逻卫兵身边溜走，没有被发现。",
	"A human woman wearing heavy black armor and a mantle adorned with the head of a raven holds her ground against a cadre of skeletal warriors. Silhouetted by the light of a full moon, she flourishes her cloak and instantly vanishes before her attackers. Reappearing behind the undead, the skeletons stagger blindly as a rain of silver-burning smites fall amongst them.": "一个身穿厚重的黑色盔甲、披着饰有乌鸦头颅的斗篷的人类女性，在面对一干骷髅战士的时候，坚持自己的立场。在满月的照耀下，她披上斗篷，瞬间消失在攻击者面前。重新出现在亡灵身后时，这些骷髅盲目地踉跄着，因为银色燃烧的击打雨落在他们中间。",
	"As he springs away from his pursuers, a male tiefling in dusky leather armor grasps an ornamental spiked chain bound around his wrist. Tendrils of darkness seep from his fingers, swimming out to blind and engulf his foes.": "当他从追兵身边跳开时，一个身穿暗色皮甲的男性盗贼抓着一条绑在手腕上的装饰性尖刺链。黑暗的卷轴从他的手指中渗出，游走在黑暗中，吞噬着他的敌人。",
	"The Oath of the Midnight Hour is a pledge to serve as the weapon of a dark patron that eschews the light of day. This patron can be of any alignment or agenda, and it is said the first paladins to swear this Oath swore it to the night itself, to defend night travelers from those that would prey on them. Paladins that take this oath are most frequently known as night-watchers, shadowguards, or darksworn.": "午夜之誓是一个誓言，作为黑暗守护者的武器，避开白天的光亮。这个守护者可以是任何方向或议程，据说第一个宣誓的圣骑士是对黑夜本身宣誓的，以保护夜行者不受那些猎物的伤害。发誓的圣骑士最常被称为 \"守夜人\"、\"影卫 \"或 \"暗夜使者\"。",
	"Most paladins that pledge this Oath are lawful and loyal to the decrees of their patron, be their patron god or monster. Chaotic paladins of this oath do exist, however, and occasionally find themselves at odds with their own master, struggling for freedom or redemption against the very force they swore to obey. For their part, particularly evil patrons with ties to undeath (such as Strahd, Vecna, or Tenebrous) may visit mortals on the verge of dying and require that they undertake this Oath of service to continue living. Good and neutral patrons often merely have the paladin swear this Oath at midnight under a portentous lunar auspice (usually a new, full, crescent, or blood moon) before they enter service.": "大多数宣誓的圣骑士都是合法的，忠于他们的守护者的法令，无论是守护神还是怪物。然而，确实存在混沌的圣骑士，他们偶尔会发现自己与自己的主人发生冲突，为自由或救赎而挣扎，而他们发誓要服从的正是这种力量。对他们来说，与不死之身有联系的特别邪恶的赞助人（如斯特拉赫特、韦克纳或泰尼布罗斯）可能会拜访濒临死亡的凡人，并要求他们履行这一服务誓言以继续生存。善良和中立的赞助人通常只是让圣骑士在午夜时分，在一个预兆性的月光下（通常是新月、满月、新月或血月）宣誓，然后才进入服务。",
	"Paladins of the Midnight Hour universally wear shades of dark brown, grey, and black, and are equally at home in leathers as they are in mail or plate. Always a foreboding sight, even good-aligned paladins of this Oath sometimes find themselves the target of fear, suspicion, and prejudice from those afraid of what they represent.": "午夜时分的圣骑士普遍穿着深棕色、灰色和黑色的衣服，穿皮衣和穿盔甲同样自如。他们总是让人感到不寒而栗，即使是善意的圣骑士，有时也会发现自己成为那些害怕他们所代表的人的恐惧、猜疑和偏见的目标。",
	"The following virtues are common amongst those that take this Oath, though the entity to whom a paladin swears fealty (or an organization representing that entity) may alter these vows in subtle and significant ways. These entities often have their own, specific vows, which you may determine with your DM or roll for on the Midnight Directive table.": "以下的美德在发此誓言的人中很常见，尽管圣骑士宣誓效忠的实体（或代表该实体的组织）可能会以微妙而重要的方式改变这些誓言。这些实体通常有他们自己的、特定的誓言，你可以和你的管理员一起决定，或者在 \"午夜指令 \"表上进行滚动。",
	"Whether your deeds be noble or nefarious, very little good comes from drawing undue attention to oneself. Rarely let your name or face be known; those that remain unrecognized live to fight another day.": "无论你的行为是高尚的还是邪恶的，引起人们对自己的过分关注是没有什么好处的。很少让人知道你的名字或面孔；那些不被承认的人可以活到下一天。",
	"Stumbling into a situation without a clear idea of how to proceed is a particularly poor way to die. Plan thoroughly for all contingencies, but do not be afraid to modify your plans on the fly, should the situation change.": "在不清楚如何进行的情况下跌跌撞撞地进入困境是一种特别糟糕的死亡方式。对所有突发事件进行全面计划，但不要害怕在情况发生变化时临时修改你的计划。",
	"Belongings, personal and professional, are sacred, and may never be deprived from their owners without a specific business agreement. Those who forcibly separate individuals from their belongings through theft or swindling demand retribution. and the owner's restitution.": "财产，无论是个人的还是职业的，都是神圣的，如果没有具体的商业协议，决不能剥夺其所有者的财产。那些通过偷窃或诈骗强行将个人与他们的财物分开的人，要求得到报应。 并要求所有者归还。",
	"Whether you see those at your side as allies or mere assets, their utility and aid cannot be ignored. Look after them, assist them in their struggles, and make sure they profit from your presence just as much as you profit from theirs.": "无论你把那些在你身边的人看作是盟友还是单纯的资产，他们的效用和援助都是不容忽视的。照顾他们，在他们的斗争中协助他们，并确保他们从你的存在中获益，就像你从他们的存在中获益一样。",

	"When you have advantage on an attack against an enemy, hit with that attack, and use your Divine Smite feature, you may also whisper a silent blessing and use your Channel Divinity, empowering your weapon with dreadful shadow energy. If you do, your Divine Smite deals {@dice 2d8} additional damage, and all damage caused by Divine Smite for this attack becomes either psychic or necrotic damage (your choice). This additional damage increases to {@dice 3d8} at 6th level, {@dice 4d8} at 10th, {@dice 5d8} at 14th, and {@dice 6d8} at 18th.": "当你对敌人的攻击有优势，用该攻击命中，并使用你的神圣打击功能时，你也可以低声祝福并使用你的通道神性，用可怕的阴影能量赋予你的武器。如果你这样做，你的神圣打击会造成{@dice 2d8}的额外伤害，而且神圣打击对这次攻击造成的所有伤害会变成精神伤害或坏死伤害（由你选择）。这种额外伤害在6级时增加到{@dice 3d8}，10级时增加到{@dice 4d8}，14级时增加到{@dice 5d8}，18级时增加到{@dice 6d8}。",
	"As an action you present a holy symbol, begin concentrating and use your Channel Divinity, weaving your umbral power around you to hide yourself from view. For up to an hour or until you break concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), attack, or cast a spell, you are {@condition invisible} and your armor does not give you disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks. You are also completely silent and incapable of making noise while under your Nightcloak, and are thus unable to communicate unless you possess telepathy or similar.": "作为一个行动，你出示一个神圣的符号，开始集中注意力，并使用你的通道神性，在你周围编织你的神力来隐藏你自己。在长达一个小时的时间里，或者直到你中断注意力（就像你在集中精力施展法术一样）、攻击或者施展法术，你都会有（%0%），而且你的盔甲不会让你在灵巧（（%1%））检查中处于不利地位。在夜行斗篷下，你也是完全无声的，无法发出声音，因此无法交流，除非你拥有心灵感应或类似的能力。",
	"Beginning at 7th level, the darkness grants you a boon, which you may pass on to those around you. For you and creatures you choose within 10 feet of you, armor does not impose disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, and creatures within this radius gain {@sense darkvision} out to 60 feet or increase the distance of their current {@sense darkvision} by 60 feet. Further, any affected creature within the radius may noiselessly whisper a message that may be heard clearly and at full volume only by other affected creatures within the radius. This benefit may allow you to be heard while under the effects of your Nightcloak.": "从第7级开始，黑暗赋予你一种恩惠，你可以把它传递给你周围的人。对于你和你选择的10英尺范围内的生物，盔甲不会对灵巧（（%0%））检查造成不利影响，而且这个半径范围内的生物获得（%1%）到60英尺的距离，或者将他们当前的（%2%）距离增加60英尺。此外，半径范围内的任何受影响的生物可以无声地低语，只有半径范围内的其他受影响的生物可以清楚地听到一个信息，并且是全音量。这个好处可以让你在夜行衣的作用下被听到。",

When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack against you or a creature friendly to you, you may use your reaction to teleport yourself through your own shadow to a point within 5 feet of the attacking creature. You may then make one attack against the creature, resolving it after the creature resolves its attacks. This ability may also trigger if the attacking creature is up to 60 feet away, if the creature is standing in an area of dim light or darkness.": "从15级开始，你可以穿过黑暗，对那些威胁你盟友的人进行报复性攻击。当一个在你30英尺范围内的生物对你或对你友好的生物进行攻击时，你可以用你的反应将自己通过自己的影子传送到距离攻击生物5英尺范围内的一个点。然后你可以对该生物进行一次攻击，在该生物解决其攻击之后再解决。如果攻击的生物在60英尺以外，如果该生物站在昏暗的光线或黑暗的区域，也可以触发这个能力。",

For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:": "在20级时，你越来越接近于与黑夜融为一体。在你的行动中，你可以让你体内的影子能量超越你的身体形态，将你转化为一个不断变化的、漆黑的、模糊的人形恐怖，对那些可能看到你的人来说，你就是他们恐怖的化身。在1分钟内，你会获得以下好处。",
