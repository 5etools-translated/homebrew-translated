	"Whether you can comprehend what you learn is also at the DM's discretion - eating a wizard's tome of spells may prove useless to you unless you have levels in {@class Wizard}, but that doesn't mean you don't know the words that make the spells up. Another example may be creature HP - DM's may decide not to give you exact values however may inform you of a more vague level of HP the creature has.": "你是否能够理解你所学到的东西也是由DM决定的--吃下一个巫师的法术书可能证明对你毫无用处，除非你有（%0%）的水平，但这并不意味着你不知道构成法术的单词。另一个例子是生物的HP--DM可以决定不给你准确的数值，但可以告知你生物的HP的一个更模糊的水平。",
