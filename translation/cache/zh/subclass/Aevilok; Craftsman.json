	"While some rogues prefer to focus on their agility or accuracy, the Craftsmen are the rogues that like to solve their problems using any tool they can get at their disposal. These rogues face problems with clever thinking, and an even more clever use of the items they can find, making makeshift ropes, tents, or bags of caltrops to execute their plan.": "有些流氓喜欢专注于他们的敏捷性或准确性，而工匠们则是喜欢用他们能得到的任何工具来解决问题的流氓。这些流氓用聪明的思维来面对问题，更巧妙地利用他们能找到的物品，制作临时的绳索、帐篷或袋装的卡特尔来执行他们的计划。",
	"At 3rd level, you start to understand how different items are created and how they can be improved.": "到了第三级，你开始了解不同的物品是如何产生的，以及如何改进它们。",
	"Your familiarity with {@item thieves' tools|phb} and their versatility allows you to use them as {@item tinker's tools|phb} whenever something requires you to do so.": "你对{@item thieves' tools|phb}的熟悉程度和它们的多功能性使你能够在有事情需要你的时候把它们当作{@item tinker's tools|phb}来使用。",
	"Choose four of the items detailed under the {@table Adventuring Gear|phb} table. These are your Favored Formulae and cost a quarter their normal price for your crafting (rounded down). You can choose two additional items as your Favored Formulae when you reach 9th, 13th and 17th level.": "从{@table Adventuring Gear|phb}表下详细列出的物品中选择四个。这些是你喜欢的配方，在你的制作过程中需要花费它们正常价格的四分之一（向下取整）。当你达到9级、13级和17级时，你可以选择另外两件物品作为你喜爱的配方。",
	"By spending 1 hour with your {@item tinker's tools|phb} over the course of a short or long rest, you can craft items from your list of Favored Formulae, worth up to 6gp. You decide how many of each type of item you want to make. The maximum cost of these items increases as you gain levels in this class, increasing to 2 times your Rogue level. If an item in your favored formulae is worth less than 1 gp, you can spend 1 minute to craft it during the adventuring day.": "在短时或长时的休息过程中，用你的（%0%）花费1小时，你可以从你所喜爱的配方列表中制作物品，价值最多为6gp。你决定你想制作多少种物品。这些物品的最大成本随着你在这个等级中的等级提升而增加，增加到你的游侠等级的2倍。如果你喜爱的配方中的物品价值低于1gp，你可以在冒险日内花1分钟时间制作它。",
	"For example, {@item hunting trap|phb|hunting traps} cost 1 gp to craft for a Craftsman that has them as one of their favored formulae. At 3rd level, as part of a long or short rest, they can craft up to 6 hunting traps.": "例如，{@item hunting trap|phb|hunting traps}对于一个将其作为自己最喜欢的配方之一的工匠来说，制作的成本是1个GP。在3级时，作为长时间或短时间休息的一部分，他们最多可以制作6个狩猎陷阱。",
	"You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with {@item smith's tools|phb} needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.": "你可以制作非魔法物品，包括冒险装备和艺术作品。你必须精通与你要制作的物品有关的工具（通常是工匠的工具）。你可能还需要获得创造它所需的特殊材料或地点。例如，精通（%0%）的人需要一个锻造厂来制作一把剑或一套盔甲。",
	"For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of {@item plate armor|phb} (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.": "你每花一天的停工时间，就可以制作一件或多件总市场价值不超过5戈比的物品，你必须消耗价值为总市场价值一半的原材料。如果你想制作的东西的市场价值大于5GP，你每天都会以5GP为单位取得进展，直到你达到该物品的市场价值。例如，一件{@item plate armor|phb}(市场价值1,500 gp)的衣服需要300天才能自己制作。",
	"Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.": "多个角色可以合力制作一件物品，前提是这些角色都熟练掌握必要的工具，并且在同一个地方工作。每个角色在帮助制作物品的过程中，每花一天时间就会贡献价值5戈比的努力。例如，三个具有必要的工具熟练度和适当设施的人物可以在100天内制作一套板甲，总成本为750GP。",
	"While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on {@table lifestyle expenses|phb}).": "在制作过程中，你可以维持适度的生活方式，而不需要每天支付1个金币，或者以正常费用的一半维持舒适的生活方式（关于（%0%）的更多信息，见第5章）。",
	"Whenever an item you create forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can choose to set that saving throw's DC to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, whenever an item you have created deals damage to a creature, it takes additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.": "每当你创造的物品强迫一个生物做一个蓄力动作时，你可以选择将蓄力动作的DC设定为8+你的熟练度加成+你的智力修饰。此外，每当你创造的物品对一个生物造成伤害时，它所受到的额外伤害等于你的智力修正值。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, while crafting an item in your list of favored formulae, you may scavenge for material scraps to reduce the material cost of your designs. If you choose to do so, the amount of gp you need to expend for your crafting is reduced by a number equal to your Rogue level + your Intelligence modifier.": "从3级开始，在制作你所喜爱的配方列表中的物品时，你可以搜刮材料碎片来降低你设计的材料成本。如果你选择这样做，你制作物品所需的金币数量就会减少，减少的数量等于你的游侠等级+你的智力修正值。",
	"Collecting scraps does not speed up or slow down the creation process and these scraps have no value to others, as they are simply stray pieces of wood, stone, metal, or other materials, specifically collected for the design you're currently working on.": "收集废料并不能加快或减慢创作过程，而且这些废料对其他人来说没有任何价值，因为它们只是一些杂乱的木头、石头、金属或其他材料，是专门为你目前正在进行的设计而收集的。",
	"Depending on your environment, your DM may determine that you can not find appropriate scraps for your design. Additionally, an item made this way looks rough and impractical; you have disadvantage and suffer a -5 penalty on charisma checks made to sell such an item.": "根据你所处的环境，你的管理员可能会决定你找不到合适的废料来做你的设计。此外，这样做出来的物品看起来很粗糙，不实用；你在出售这样的物品时有劣势，并在魅力检查中受到-5的惩罚。",
	"Starting at 9th level, you can use the bonus action granted by your {@classFeature Cunning Action|Rogue||2} to take the {@action Use an Object} action.": "从第9级开始，你可以使用你的（%0%）所赋予的额外行动来进行（%1%）的行动。",
	"When you reach 13th level, as part of a long rest, you can craft a clockwork familiar.": "当你达到13级时，作为长时间休息的一部分，你可以制作一个钟表熟悉物。",
	"A clockwork familiar has the form of an animal you choose: {@creature bat}, {@creature cat}, {@creature crab}, {@creature frog} (toad), {@creature hawk}, {@creature lizard}, {@creature octopus}, {@creature owl}, {@creature poisonous snake}, fish ({@creature quipper}), {@creature rat}, {@creature raven}, {@creature sea horse}, {@creature spider}, or {@creature weasel}. It has the statistics of the chosen animal, though it is a Construct instead of a Beast and has a speed of 30 feet or a flying speed of 20 feet (your choice). It has immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as the {@condition charmed}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition poisoned} conditions and {@condition exhaustion}.": "钟表熟人具有你所选择的动物形态：{@creature bat}、{@creature cat}、{@creature crab}、{@creature frog}（蟾蜍）、{@creature hawk}、{@creature lizard}、{@creature octopus}、{@creature owl}、{@creature poisonous snake}、鱼（{@creature quipper}）、{@creature rat}、{@creature raven}、{@creature sea horse}、{@creature spider}、或（%14%）。它具有所选动物的统计数据，尽管它是一个结构体而不是一个野兽，并且有30英尺的速度或20英尺的飞行速度（你选择）。它对毒药和精神伤害，以及{@condition charmed}、{@condition frightened}、{@condition poisoned}和{@condition exhaustion}的条件具有免疫力。",
	"The familiar remains inactive, until you take the {@action Use an Object} action to cause it to animate. For the next minute, the familiar moves in a straight line away from the point where you activated it, causing a ruckus and distracting everyone within 15 feet of it. Creatures distracted by the familiar make Dexterity Saving throws with disadvantage and attacks against them have advantage. As a free action on your turn, you can change the direction a windup familiar within 5 feet of you is moving towards.": "熟悉的人保持不动，直到你采取{@action Use an Object}的行动来使它活过来。在接下来的一分钟里，这个熟悉的人从你激活它的地方沿着一条直线移动，引起一阵骚动，分散周围15英尺内所有人的注意力。被熟悉的人分散注意力的生物在进行灵巧判断时处于劣势，而对它们的攻击具有优势。在你的回合中，作为一个自由行动，你可以改变一个在你5英尺范围内的卷曲熟悉者的移动方向。",
	"After the familiar drops to 0 hit points, or after it takes damage, you can spend a minute to repair it, healing it to full hit points.": "在熟悉的人下降到0命中率后，或者在它受到伤害后，你可以花一分钟时间来修复它，把它的命中率治疗到满分。",
	"Beginning at 17th level, you can lay mechanical traps on the ground, setting the stage to suit your needs. While crafting an item, you can spend another 10 gp to encase it in an intricate trap design, that allows you to program it. When crafting a trap in this way, you may specify a trigger and how the trap should act.": "从17级开始，你可以在地上布置机械陷阱，根据你的需要设置舞台。在制作一件物品时，你可以再花10个金币把它包裹在一个复杂的陷阱设计中，这样你就可以对它进行编程。以这种方式制作陷阱时，你可以指定一个触发器和陷阱应该如何行动。",
	"The trap can only cause the original item's effect, but how it does so may vary; for example, a trap made with a base of {@item alchemist's fire (flask)|phb|Alchemist's Fire} may include a {@item tripwire|roguecraft} that when stepped on, flings the flask of Alchemist's Fire towards where the tripwire was disturbed.": "陷阱只能引起原始物品的效果，但它的方式可能有所不同；例如，一个以（%0%）为基础的陷阱可能包括一个（%1%），当被踩到时，会将炼金术士之火的瓶子甩向绊线被扰乱的地方。",
	"You can plant a trap on the ground or a wall, using the {@action Use an Object} action, and once you do so, it can be discovered by a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your effect save DC. If you have proficiency in Stealth, you can additionally add your proficiency bonus to this DC.": "你可以使用（%0%）动作在地上或墙上放置一个陷阱，一旦你这样做了，就可以通过成功的智力（调查）检查来发现你的效果保存DC。如果你精通隐身术，你可以将你的熟练度加到这个DC上。",
	"At your DM's discretion, a trap may be triggered more than once, if it makes sense for it to do so. Otherwise, once triggered, the trap can not be used again.": "根据DM的决定，如果一个陷阱有意义的话，它可以被触发不止一次。否则，一旦触发，陷阱就不能再使用。",
	"A pair of weights connected by a rope. As an action, you can throw the bola up to 20 feet, to ensnare a creature. Make a ranged Attack against a creature, treating the Bola as an improvised ranged weapon. On a hit, the creature falls {@condition prone} and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until it is freed. A bola has no effect on creatures that are formless, creatures that do not have legs or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bola (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the bola.": "一对由绳子连接的重物。作为一个动作，你可以将博拉扔到20英尺远的地方，以困住一个生物。对一个生物进行远程攻击，将博拉作为一个简易的远程武器。一旦命中，该生物就会倒下（%0%），其速度降低10英尺，直到它被释放。波拉对无形的生物、没有腿的生物或巨大或更大的生物没有效果。一个生物可以用它的行动来进行DC12力量检查，如果成功，就可以释放自己或在其范围内的其他生物。对波拉造成5次砍击伤害（AC10），也能释放生物而不伤害它，结束效果并摧毁波拉。",
	"A magnet the size of 3 coins stacked. It can stop up to 2 pounds of steel or other magnetic material it is in contact with from falling.": "一块只有3个硬币大小的磁铁叠在一起。它可以阻止2磅重的钢铁或其他与之接触的磁性材料掉落。",

To benefit from this flying speed, the creature must be able to operate the wings, which requires a free hand.": "当戴上这些翅膀，并且没有穿上重甲或超过其承载能力时，一个生物会获得20英尺的飞行速度。为了从这个飞行速度中获益，生物必须能够操作翅膀，这需要一只自由的手。",
	"A carefully blown droplet of glass, ready to explode at any moment. As an action, you can throw the droplet to a point you can see within 20 feet of you causing it to explode into millions of shards. Creatures within a 5 feet radius must succed in a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or take {@damage 2d12} piercing damage.": "一个精心吹制的玻璃液滴，随时准备爆炸。作为一个动作，你可以将玻璃滴扔到你20英尺范围内你能看到的地方，使其爆炸成数百万块碎片。半径5英尺范围内的生物必须在DC17的灵巧救赎中成功，否则会受到{@damage 2d12}的穿刺伤害。",
	"When thrown, this cannister creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for one minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.": "抛出后，这个罐子会以它为中心产生一个半径为20英尺的雾球。该球体在角落里扩散，其区域被严重遮蔽。它持续一分钟或直到中等或更高速度的风（至少每小时10英里）将其驱散。",
	"This tiny bell is covered in a strong adhesive and can very easily stick to any surface. As an action, you can draw the bell from its casing and make an attack against a creature, treating the bell as an improvised melee weapon with the thrown (20/60) property. On a hit, the bell sticks to the creature, causing it to make sound whenever it moves or takes an action. A creature can use its action to remove the bell, ending its effects.": "这个小铃铛被一种强力的粘合剂包裹着，可以非常容易地粘在任何表面上。作为一个动作，你可以把铃铛从它的外壳中抽出来，对一个生物进行攻击，把铃铛当作一个具有投掷（20/60）属性的临时近战武器。一旦命中，铃铛就会粘在该生物身上，使其在移动或行动时发出声音。生物可以用它的行动来移除铃铛，结束它的效果。",
	"When you use your action to set it, this string forms a discrete line that can make a creature trip over. When a creature that has at most 2 legs steps on the tripwire, it falls {@condition prone}, destroying the tripwire. A bell of any kind can be attached to the tripwire, causing it to make sound when triggered.": "当你用你的行动来设置它时，这根绳子形成一条不连续的线，可以使生物绊倒。当一个最多只有两条腿的生物踩到绊线时，它就会跌倒（%0%），破坏绊线。任何种类的铃铛都可以连接到绊线上，使其在被触发时发出声音。"
