	"An Arcane Marksman studies a unique method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. These techniques are the favorite of a variety of expert marksmen, including elite elven sentinels, dwarven gnoll hunters, and a number of well-known mercenaries. These fighters can turn a simple arrow, bolt or even sling bullet into a vessel for magic that harms and debilitates their enemies. Requiring both a mastery of ranged combat and an understanding of the arcane arts, Arcane Marksmen stand out as versatile and effective sharpshooters.": "奥术射手研究一种独特的射箭方法，将魔法编织到攻击中以产生超自然的效果。这些技术是各种专家级射手的最爱，包括精英的精灵哨兵、矮人的地精猎人和一些知名的雇佣兵。这些战士可以把简单的箭、螺栓甚至吊索子弹变成魔法的容器，伤害和削弱他们的敌人。由于需要掌握远程战斗和对奥术的理解，奥术射手作为多功能和有效的神射手脱颖而出。",
	"This subclass is a replacement of the Arcane Archer presented in {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}, which dissatisfied me in a number of significant ways, including being bow-only and having highly limited usages of its core identifying feature. So, I designed this to fix my issues with the subclass, and polished up some other aspects along the way, as well as genericizing the flavor away from being elf-centric. Here's some of my thoughts on the changes I've made, which also serves as a changelog from the XGE version:": "这个子类是对{@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}中的奥术弓箭手的替代，它在很多方面都让我不满意，包括只能用弓，而且其核心识别功能的使用非常有限。因此，我设计了这个子类来解决我的问题，并在此过程中完善了一些其他方面，同时将其味道从以精灵为中心转为通用。以下是我对所做修改的一些想法，也是XGE版本的修改记录。",
	"Name switched to Arcane Marksman to distinguish from the regular XGE version and to make the archetype more clearly not restricted to bows.": "名称改为奥术射手，以区别于普通的XGE版本，并使该原型更明显地不限于弓箭。",
	"I assume the elven lore connection is a Forgotten Realms thing. I've gone and made the archetype setting agnostic. This is also why they get just Arcana proficiency rather than nature/arcana.": "我想精灵传说的联系是被遗忘的领域的事情。我已经把这个原型设定为不可知的。这也是为什么他们只得到阿卡纳熟练度而不是自然/阿卡纳。",
	"Magic Arrow and Arcane Shot were combined into one feature, as they were not really that seperate anyway. The bows-only restriction has been lifted (here and in subsequent features), as that was pretty much totally arbitrary. Now you can have arcane crossbowmen and slingers too.": "魔法箭和奥术射击被合并为一个功能，因为它们反正也不是真的那么独立。只有弓箭的限制已经被取消了（在这里和随后的特性中），因为那是完全任意的。现在你也可以拥有奥术弓箭手和投手了。",
	"Number of arcane shots per rest was increased to Intelligence Modifier, to promote investing in Int and also promote use of the Arcane Archer's iconic feature. This also means that the extra damage per shot needs to be lower than with 2/rest, so I've bumped them down to {@dice 1d6}/{@dice 2d6}.": "每次休息时的奥术射击次数增加到智力修饰，以促进对智力的投资，同时也促进使用奥术射手的标志性功能。这也意味着每次射击的额外伤害需要比2/休息时低，所以我把它们降到了（%0%）/（%1%）。",
	"60ft on Curving Shot seemed kind of excessive, I think 30ft fits the flavor a bit better without signifcantly impacting the power level.": "弯弓射箭的60英尺似乎有点过了，我认为30英尺更适合这个味道，而且不会对力量水平产生明显的影响。",
	"Ever-Ready Shot was buffed, since you now have more uses but each individual shot is weaker. Also added an ammo ribbon to it.": "常备射击得到了增强，因为你现在有更多的使用次数，但每一次单独射击都比较弱。还为它增加了一个弹药带。",
	"The original subclass was missing a 10th level feature (regardless of what the designers say on Twitter), so Forceful Shot was added. The feature is not directly useful to you (disadvantage on ranged vs prone), but adds anti-flying and teamwork utility.": "最初的子类缺少一个10级的特性（不管设计者在Twitter上怎么说），所以加入了强力射击。这个特性对你没有直接的作用（在远程对俯卧时处于劣势），但增加了反飞行和团队协作的效用。",
	"All references to \"arrows\" were changed to \"shot\" to allow any ammunition to be used.": "所有提到的 \"箭 \"都被改为 \"射\"，以允许使用任何弹药。",
	"Piercing Shot's extra damage was flipped to Force (ironically, given its name) as it seems more fitting for an ethereal attack.": "穿透射击的额外伤害被翻转为力（具有讽刺意味的是，考虑到它的名字），因为它似乎更适合于空灵的攻击。",
	"Seeking Shot's extra damage was flipped to Piercing, as Force damage seemed unfitting for a divination effect.": "寻求射击的额外伤害被翻转为穿刺，因为武力伤害似乎不适合占卜效果。",
	"At 3rd level, studying the techniques required to produce your arcane shots has taught you basic magic. You gain proficiency in {@skill Arcana}, and learn the {@spell prestidigitation} cantrip.": "在3级时，研究产生你的奥术射击所需的技术使你学会了基本魔法。你获得了对（%0%）的熟练度，并学习了（%1%）的咒语。",
	"When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to infuse your shots with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical piece of ammunition from a ranged weapon, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the shot immediately after it hits or misses its target.": "当你在3级选择这个原型时，你获得了为你的射击注入魔法的能力。每当你用远程武器发射非魔法的弹药时，你可以使其具有魔法，以克服对非魔法攻击和伤害的抵抗和免疫力。在击中或未击中目标后，魔法会立即从射击中消失。",
	"Additionally, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the \"Arcane Shot Options\" section). Once per turn when you fire a magical piece of ammunition from a ranged weapon as part of the {@action Attack} action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that shot. You decide to use the option when the attack hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have a number of uses of this ability equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.": "此外，你还学会了两个自选的奥术射击选项（见 \"奥术射击选项 \"部分）。每回合一次，当你从远程武器中发射一个神奇的弹药作为（%0%）动作的一部分时，你可以将你的奥术射击选项之一应用于该射击。你决定在攻击击中生物时使用该选项，除非该选项不涉及攻击卷。你拥有的这个能力的使用次数等于你的智力修正值，当你完成短时或长时休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用次数。",
	"You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.": "当你达到这个等级的某些级别时，你会获得一个额外的奥术射击选项，供你选择。第7、10、15和18级。当你成为一个18级的战士时，每个选项也会得到改善。",
	"The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.": "奥术射击功能让你在某些级别上为它选择选项。这里的选项是按字母顺序排列的。它们都是魔法效果，每一个都与某个魔法流派有关。",
	"If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.": "如果一个选项需要蓄力，你的奥术射击蓄力DC等于8+你的熟练度加成+你的智力修正值。",
	"At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magical piece of ammunition and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 30 feet of the original target.": "在7级时，你学会了如何将一个错误的射击指向一个新的目标。当你用一个神奇的弹药做攻击卷而没有命中时，你可以用一个额外的动作对原来目标30英尺内的不同目标重新做攻击卷。",
	"At 7th level, you learn another Arcane Shot option of your choice.": "7级时，你可以学习另一个你选择的奥术射击选项。",
	"At 10th level, you learn another Arcane Shot option of your choice.": "在10级时，你可以学习另一个你选择的奥术射击选项。",
	"At 15th level, you learn another Arcane Shot option of your choice.": "15级时，你可以选择学习另一个奥术射击选项。",
	"At 18th level, you learn another Arcane Shot option of your choice.": "在18级时，你可以学习另一个你选择的奥术射击选项。",
	"Beginning at 10th level, when you hit a creature with an Arcane Shot, you can spend an additional use of Arcane Shot to knock the target {@condition prone}.": "从10级开始，当你用奥术射击击中一个生物时，你可以额外使用一次奥术射击来击倒目标（%0%）。",
	"Starting at 15th level, your marksmanship is always ready for a fight. When you roll initiative, you regain one use of Arcane Shot. If you have no uses remaining, you regain two uses of it instead.": "从15级开始，你的枪法可以随时准备战斗。当你掷出主动权时，你重新获得一次奥术射击的使用权。如果你没有剩余的使用次数，你将重新获得两次使用次数。",
	"Additionally, you can conjure 30 pieces of ammunition as a bonus action, which disappear after 1 minute. You choose the type of ammunition, which is magical, and appears in your quiver or equivalent container.": "此外，你可以作为一个额外的动作变出30个弹药，这些弹药在1分钟后消失。你可以选择弹药的类型，它是神奇的，并出现在你的箭筒或同等的容器中。",
	"You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target from this plane. If the shot hits a creature, the target must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is {@condition incapacitated}. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.": "你使用咒语魔法试图将你的目标暂时驱逐出这个平面。如果你射中了一个生物，该目标也必须成功地进行 \"魅力拯救\"，否则就会被放逐。当以这种方式被放逐时，它的速度为0，并且是（%0%）。在它的下一个回合结束时，目标会重新出现在它腾出的空间中，或者在最近的无人空间中（如果该空间被占用）。",
	"After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes {@dice 1d6} force damage when the shot hits it.": "在你达到这个等级的18级后，当射击击中目标时，目标也会受到{@dice 1d6}武力伤害。",
	"Your enchantment magic causes this shot to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra {@dice 1d6} psychic damage, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it is {@condition charmed} by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the {@condition charmed} target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.": "你的魔法使这一枪暂时迷惑其目标。在目标的30英尺范围内选择一个你的盟友。被箭射中的生物会受到额外的（%0%）精神伤害，并且必须在智慧救赎中成功，否则会被所选的盟友（%1%），直到你下一回合开始。如果被选择的盟友攻击了{@condition charmed}的目标，对其造成伤害，或迫使其做出救赎动作，则该效果提前结束。",
	"The psychic damage increases to {@dice 2d6} when you reach 18th level in this class.": "当你在这个等级达到18级时，精神伤害增加到（%0%）。",
	"You imbue your shot with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take {@dice 1d6} force damage each.": "你用从唤起学派中提取的力量能量灌注你的射击。这些能量在你的攻击后引爆。射中生物后，目标和周围10英尺内的所有其他生物立即受到{@dice 1d6}武力伤害。",
	"The force damage increases to {@dice 2d6} when you reach 18th level in this class.": "当你在这个等级达到18级时，武力伤害增加到（%0%）。",
	"You weave necromantic magic into your shot. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra {@dice 1d6} necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.": "你在你的射击中编织了亡灵魔法。被射中的生物会受到额外的{@dice 1d6}坏死性伤害。目标也必须在宪法救赎中成功，否则其武器攻击造成的伤害将减半，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"The necrotic damage increases to {@dice 2d6} when you reach 18th level in this class.": "当你在这个等级达到18级时，坏死的伤害增加到（%0%）。",
	"When this shot strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra {@dice 1d6} poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes {@dice 1d6} slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this arcane shot option again.": "当这一枪击中目标时，魔法创造出抓人的、有毒的荆棘，缠绕着目标。被击中的生物会受到额外的{@dice 1d6}毒药伤害，它的速度会降低10英尺，并且在它每次移动1英尺或更多而没有传送的情况下，第一次会受到{@dice 1d6}砍伤。目标或任何能接触到它的生物可以用它的行动来移除荆棘，只要对你的奥术射击救赎DC进行强度（（%2%））检查成功。否则，荆棘会持续1分钟或直到你再次使用这个奥术射击选项。",
	"The poison and slashing damage both increase to {@dice 2d6} when you reach 18th level in this class.": "当你在这个等级达到18级时，毒药和砍伤的伤害都增加到（%0%）。",
	"You use transmutation magic to give your shot an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra {@dice 1d6} force damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.": "你使用转化魔法，使你的射击具有空灵的品质。当你使用这个选项时，你不需要为攻击做攻击卷。相反，射击会以一条宽1英尺、长30英尺的线向前发射，然后消失。射击会无害地穿过物体，无视掩体。这条线上的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，目标会受到伤害，就像它被射中一样，加上额外的（%0%）武力伤害。拯救成功时，目标会受到一半的伤害。",
	"Using divination magic, you grant your shot the ability to seek out your target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra {@dice 1d6} piercing damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.": "使用占卜魔法，你赋予你的射击以寻找目标的能力。当你使用这个选项时，你不需要为攻击做一个攻击卷。相反，选择一个你在过去一分钟内见过的生物。射击会飞向该生物，必要时在角落里移动，无视四分之三的掩护和半掩护。如果目标在武器的射程内，并且有足够大的路径让子弹飞向目标，目标必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，它将受到如同被射击击中一样的伤害，外加一个额外的{@dice 1d6}穿刺伤害，并且你将了解目标的当前位置。救赎成功时，目标会受到一半的伤害，并且你不会知道它的位置。",
