Field medics train to both dispatch enemies and repair allies, learning to become skilled with every application of a blade.": "在战争时期，许多没有魔法天赋的人需要在前线医治和恢复他们的同伴。这些人有很多名字，但他们所服务的部队称他们为战地医护人员，这证明了他们即使在战火纷飞的战场上也能恢复他人的能力。战地医护人员在训练中既要遣散敌人，又要修复盟友，要学会熟练运用每一把刀。",

	"A creature you stabilise, whether through a Healer's Kit or a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check, that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1 minute. If the creature has to start making death saving throws before regaining any hit points, it has advantage on them.": "你所稳定的生物，无论是通过治疗者套装还是通过成功的智慧（医学）检查，如果没有被治疗，那么在1分钟后会恢复1点生命值。如果该生物在恢复任何命中率之前必须开始进行死亡救赎，它在这些救赎上有优势。",

You must end this move closer to your ally than you started.": "从9级开始，你可以迅速缩小与盟友的差距。当你能看到或听到的盟友被降低到0命中率并倒下（%0%）时，你可以使用你的反应来移动到你的速度，而无需挑衅（%1%）。你必须在结束这个移动时比你开始时更接近你的盟友。",
