You can summon it to your hand or dismiss it with a bonus action.": "你的守护者认为自己是某种神，并像神看待其与牧师的关系一样看待它与你的契约。你被授予一个神圣的符号，你可以把它作为法术的焦点。这个神圣符号的形状并不是你们世界的神所使用的任何神圣符号，尽管它可能类似。你可以把它召唤到你的手上，或者用一个额外的行动来解除它。",

	"The ancient kings of the deserts, known as pharaohs, were more gods to their subjects than mortal lords. This veneration was not without cause, for the masters of the sands were indeed godlike in their powers: they forged cities out of living sand, raised great pyramids to channel their mighty divine power, and even mastered death itself. You, though either luck, determination, or great misfortune, have come under the sway of one of these old masters, and they grant you a portion of their immense power.": "古代的沙漠之王，被称为法老，对他们的臣民来说，与其说是凡人的领主，不如说是神。这种崇敬不是没有原因的，因为沙地的主人确实具有神一样的力量：他们用活沙子铸造城市，建造巨大的金字塔以引导他们强大的神力，甚至掌握了死亡本身。你，无论是运气、决心，还是巨大的不幸，都在这些老主人之一的支配之下，他们授予你他们巨大力量的一部分。",

You undergo a ritual taking 7 days, consisting of a number of incantations, noxious potions, and ritual marking, culminating in the removal of your still-beating heart.

This transformation carries several benefits:": "到了14级，你已经证明了你的足智多谋和对主人的忠诚，他/她授予你不朽的礼物。你要经历一个为期7天的仪式，包括一些咒语、有毒的药水和仪式上的标记，最后将你仍在跳动的心脏取出。然后把器官放在一个密封的罐子里，封住伤口，仪式就完成了：虽然不是真正的不死，但你现在永远处于接近死亡的状态。这种转变有几个好处。",

	"This blessing does come with a deadly drawback: your heart is highly vulnerable.

You cannot be returned to life, except by a {@spell true resurrection} or {@spell wish} spell, or through divine intervention.": "这种祝福确实有一个致命的缺点：你的心脏非常脆弱。如果敌人找到你的心脏，打碎罐子，用铁钉刺穿器官，你就会立即死亡，身体变成灰尘。除非是通过{@spell true resurrection}或{@spell wish}的法术，或通过神的干预，否则你无法恢复生命。",

	"The scorpion is thought to represent revenge and death, but to those who live in the vast desert wastes, the scorpion has come to symbolize stealth, passion, and preservation in the face of extinction. After all, the scorpion cannot be killed by the untamable waste, and it bows to no power other than its own. Some barbarians of the wastes worship at altars dedicated to ancient scorpion gods, and become Scorpion Heritors, men transformed by the Waste into forms better adapted to their harsh environment. With time, they come to possess the power of scorpions, and even begin to resemble them.": "人们认为蝎子代表着复仇和死亡，但对那些生活在广阔的沙漠荒原上的人来说，蝎子已经象征着隐秘、激情和面对灭绝的保护。毕竟，蝎子不可能被不可驯服的废物杀死，而且除了自己的力量之外，它不会向其他力量低头。荒原上的一些野蛮人在献给古代蝎子神的祭坛前顶礼膜拜，并成为蝎子先驱者，这些人被荒原改造成更适应恶劣环境的形态。随着时间的推移，他们开始拥有蝎子的力量，甚至开始与它们相似。",
	"Starting when you adopt this path at 3rd level, you know how to strike subtly like a scorpion.

	"Starting at 14th level, while you are raging, you sprout a spectral, yet tangible, scorpion tail. This tail is a finesse, reach weapon which cannot be disarmed and deals {@damage 1d8} poison or piercing damage (your choice) on a hit. When you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn, you can make an additional attack using your tail.": "从14级开始，当你愤怒的时候，你会长出一条幽灵般的、有形的蝎子尾巴。这条尾巴是一种精细的、可触及的武器，不能被解除，并在击中时造成{@damage 1d8}毒药或穿刺伤害（你选择）。当你在你的回合中采取{@action Attack}行动时，你可以用你的尾巴进行一次额外的攻击。",
	"In the heat of the endless wasteland, water is precious, and access to it is key to survival. Priests only swear to the Water Domain in truly hostile environments, where water is scarce enough to command divine significance in the minds of the people. In these places, clerics which can summon elemental water are the bringers of life to utter desolation, and are often the only barrier between the unending heat and lethal dehydration.": "在炎热的无尽荒原上，水是宝贵的，获得它是生存的关键。牧师们只有在真正恶劣的环境中才会向水之领域宣誓，在那里，水的稀缺程度足以在人们的心中获得神圣的意义。在这些地方，能够召唤水元素的牧师是彻底的荒凉的生命带来者，而且往往是无尽的高温和致命的脱水之间的唯一屏障。",
	"Your holy symbol is little more than a flask from which pure water flows. At 1st level, you can cast the spell {@spell create or destroy water} once without expending a spell slot. After using this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.": "你的圣物只不过是一个流淌着纯净水的水壶而已。在1级时，你可以在不消耗法术槽的情况下施展一次（%0%）的法术。在使用这个能力后，你必须完成一次短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用它。",

	"At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity as an action to form a 5-foot-radius sphere of churning water around you, while you concentrate on this effect for up to 1 minute. Ranged weapon attacks targeting you or any other creature within the sphere have disadvantage.": "在6级时，你可以使用你的通道神性作为行动，在你周围形成一个半径为5英尺的搅动水球，同时你专注于这个效果，最多1分钟。以你或球体内的任何其他生物为目标的远程武器攻击有劣势。",
	"Additionally, as a bonus action while the sphere is formed, you can lash out with a tendril of water from the sphere. This acts as a whip that uses your spell attack bonus for attack rolls, adds your Wisdom modifier to damage instead of Dexterity, and can originate from any point on the surface of the sphere.": "此外，当球体形成时，作为一个额外的动作，你可以从球体中抽出一根水的卷须。这就像一条鞭子，在攻击卷中使用你的法术攻击加成，在伤害中加入你的智慧修饰而不是灵巧，并且可以从球体表面的任何一点发出。",
	"By 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an additional 1d8 cold damage. At 14th level this increases to 2d8.": "到8级时，你获得了为你的攻击注入神圣能量的能力。在你的每个回合中，当你用武器攻击击中一个生物时，你可以使攻击造成额外的1d8寒冷伤害。在14级时，这将增加到2d8。",

After using this ability, you must complete a long rest before doing so again.": "在17级时，你受到了水元素的祝福，作为一个额外的动作，你可以变成一个由水组成的形态。在1分钟内，你对来自非魔法武器的击打、穿刺和砍击伤害有抵抗力，而且你不能被抓捕、麻痹、中毒、限制或俯卧。使用这个能力后，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次使用。",
	"In the wastes, the sun is a double-edged sword: though it brings light, warmth, and nourishment to the little greenery there is in the desert, it also burns, blinds, and can destroy those who do not respect it. Paladins who take the Oath of the Sun understand the sun's dual nature, and strive to both bring its light to the darkest reaches of the world and to protect those who fall prey to the sun's rays out of happenstance or misfortune.": "在荒原上，太阳是一把双刃剑：虽然它为沙漠中的少许绿色植物带来了光明、温暖和营养，但它也会灼伤人、蒙蔽人，并能摧毁那些不尊重它的人。发出太阳之誓的圣骑士了解太阳的双重性质，并努力将太阳的光芒带到世界上最黑暗的地方，同时保护那些因偶然或不幸而成为太阳光的牺牲品的人。",
	"Unlike other paladins, most brothers who take the Oath of the Sun belong to a clergy of a sun god of some sort, be it Amaterasu, Apollo, Ra, or any other. They most often serve as templars, protecting their temples from raiders, bandits, and more supernatural threats. They are uniformly good, though their adherence to laws other than that of their faith is sometimes shaky.": "与其他圣骑士不同，大多数发下太阳之誓的兄弟都属于某个太阳神的神职人员，无论是天照、阿波罗、拉，还是其他。他们通常担任圣殿骑士，保护他们的神庙免受突袭者、强盗和更多超自然的威胁。他们都是好人，尽管他们对信仰以外的法律的遵守有时是不稳定的。",

When you reach 9th level, the effect deals 10 points of radiant damage, and at 17th level, it deals 15 points of radiant damage.  ": "作为一个动作，你可以开始放射出明亮的阳光。当这个效果激活时，你向半径30英尺的范围内洒下亮光。此外，你会获得相当于你的圣骑士等级+你的魅力修正值的临时命中率。如果在你拥有这些命中率时，有生物用近战攻击击中你，你可以用你的反应对它造成5点辐射伤害。这个效果持续1小时，直到命中率被耗尽，或者直到你解除它。当你达到9级时，该效果会造成10点辐射伤害，17级时，会造成15点辐射伤害。",
	"As an action, you can emit a blinding flash of light. When you do so, all creatures you choose within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. An affected creature may make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.": "作为一个动作，你可以发出一道刺眼的闪光。当你这样做的时候，你所选择的20英尺范围内的所有生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，否则就会失明1分钟。受影响的生物可以在它的每个回合结束时做一个宪法救赎动作来结束这个效果。",

Additionally, at the start of each of your turns during this spell's duration, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier if you have no more than half your hit points left. Once you use this ability, you must take a long rest before you can do so again. ": "在20级时，作为你回合的行动，你可以让自己充满太阳的灿烂怒火。你可以在不使用法术槽的情况下施展该法术（%0%）。此外，在此法术持续期间的每个回合开始时，如果你剩下的命中率不超过一半，你会重新获得与你的魅力修饰值相等的命中率。一旦你使用这个能力，你必须经过长时间的休息才能再次使用。",
	"You are one of the legendary Dervish: fierce, lighting fast warriors who call the desert their home.
