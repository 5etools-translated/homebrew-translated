	"As a member of the School of Geometry, you do not limit yourself to expertise within a single school of magic. Instead, you seek to understand and exploit the arcane connections which you can draw between different magical constructs. Some geometers are meticulous scientists, taking careful and precise measurements of the arcane aether. Others appear crazed or conspiratorial as they make hurried connections only they can understand.": "作为几何学派的成员，你并不限制自己在单一魔法学派中的专长。相反，你寻求理解并利用你能在不同的魔法构造之间建立的神秘联系。有些几何学家是一丝不苟的科学家，对神秘的乙太进行仔细和精确的测量。其他人则显得疯狂或阴谋论，因为他们匆匆忙忙地建立了只有他们才能理解的联系。",
	"Beginning at 2nd level, a geometer is able to understand their arcane power as a topographical map. The drawing of a spell map is part of the process a geometer must undertake when preparing their spells. When you have selected which spells you will prepare, draw a spell map according to the following rules:": "从2级开始，一个地理学家能够把他们的奥术力量理解为地形图。绘制法术地图是地理学家准备法术时必须进行的程序之一。当你选择了你要准备的法术后，请根据以下规则绘制一张法术图。",
	"Draw a node representing each of your prepared spells and cantrips granted by your wizard class levels. Cantrips are treated as 0th level spells for the purposes of drawing your spell map.": "画出一个节点，代表你的准备好的法术和你的巫师等级所赋予的密咒的每个节点。在绘制你的法术图时，咒语被视为0级的法术。",
	"Draw straight-line connections between spells of the same spell level. The connections must form an unlooped chain with open ends, such that each spell is connected to two others of the same level, except for the ends of the chain which are connected to only one. For example, for four 1st level spells, connect the nodes as follows: o-o-o-o.": "在相同法术等级的法术之间绘制直线连接。这些连接必须形成一个两端开放的无环链，这样每个法术都与同等级的另外两个法术相连，除了链的两端只与一个相连。例如，对于四个一级法术，连接节点如下：O-O-O。",
	"Draw straight-line connections between each spell and all other spells of the same school (e.g. abjuration, necromancy) which are exactly one level higher or one level lower.": "在每个法术和所有其他同流派的法术（例如咒语、死灵）之间画出直线连接，这些法术正好高一个等级或低一个等级。",
	"Connections must not cross any other connections you have drawn.": "连接必须不与你所画的任何其他连接交叉。",
	"If you are unable to draw a straight-line connection which fits these rules, you may have to re-configure your pattern of nodes. If it is not possible to draw a potential connection under these rules, you cannot benefit from that connection.": "如果你无法画出符合这些规则的直线连接，你可能不得不重新配置你的节点模式。如果在这些规则下不可能画出一个潜在的连接，你就不能从这个连接中获益。",
	"Some of your features are dependent on the closed loops and terminals you draw into your spell map. A closed loop is defined an area enclosed on all sides by spell connections which does not contain any connections. A terminal is defined as any spell which is linked to only one other spell.": "你的一些特征取决于你在法术地图中绘制的闭合环路和终端。闭环的定义是一个由法术连接四面包围的区域，不包含任何连接。终端被定义为只与一个其他法术相连的任何法术。",
	"See the following section for some example spell maps.": "请参阅下一节，了解一些拼写图的例子。",
	"This spellmap contains the prepared spells and cantrips of a 4th level wizard with an Intelligence score of 18. It contains 4 closed loops and 1 terminal.": "这个法术图包含了一个智力值为18的四级巫师所准备的法术和咒语。它包含4个闭环和1个终端。",

	"This spellmap contains the prepared spells and cantrips of a 20th level wizard with an Intelligence score of 20. It contains 6 closed loops and 6 terminals.": "这个法术图包含一个智力值为20的20级巫师所准备的法术和咒语。它包含了6个闭环和6个终端。",

	"Drawing a spell map can be time consuming, especially at high levels. A 20th level wizard with an Intelligence score of 20 has as many as 30 nodes to connect! In order to avoid leaving your fellow players waiting, consider coming to your game with a few spell maps already prepared. Adjusting a spell map is a significantly quicker process than drawing one from scratch if you only make a handful of a substitutions each day.": "绘制法术图谱是很耗时的，尤其是在高等级时。一个智力值为20的20级巫师有多达30个节点需要连接！为了避免让你的同伴等待，你可以考虑在游戏中准备一些法术地图。为了避免让你的同伴们等待，可以考虑在游戏中准备一些法术地图。如果你每天只做少量的替换，那么调整法术地图的过程要比从头开始画一个快得多。",
	"A useful tool for building spell maps has been developed by /u/calpin99, available <a href=https://calvin99.github.io/spell-map/>here</a>.": "/u/calpin99开发了一个用于构建拼写地图的有用工具，可在<a href=https://calvin99.github.io/spell-map/>这里</a>。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, the layout of your spell map grants you insight into the fabric of reality. Its reservoirs reflect a well of power ready to spring forth at a moment's notice, and its rivers guide power to your fingertips.": "从第二级开始，你的法术地图的布局能让你洞察到现实的结构。它的水库反映了随时准备涌现的力量之井，而它的河流则引导力量到达你的指尖。",
	"You gain a +1 bonus to your Initiative rolls for each closed loop in your spell map, and your wizard cantrips deal 1 extra point of damage for each terminal in your spell map. The maximum for each of these bonuses is equal to 2 + half your wizard level.": "在你的法术地图中，每一个闭合的循环都会使你的主动性卷轴获得+1的奖励，并且你的巫师咒语会对你法术地图中的每一个终端造成1点额外伤害。这些奖励的最大值等于2+你的魔法师等级的一半。",
	"Starting at 6th level, the spells you link within the same resevoir can bleed into one another in a spectacular or subtle fashion. Whenever you cast a spell which is part of a closed loop in your spell map, you may choose one of the following effects to apply to that spell:": "从第6级开始，你在同一个贮藏室中链接的法术可以以一种壮观或微妙的方式相互渗入。每当你施放一个属于你的法术图谱中的闭环的法术时，你可以选择以下效果之一来应用于该法术。",
	"If the spell deals damage, you may change the damage type to any other type dealt by a spell within the same closed loop.": "如果该咒语造成伤害，你可以将伤害类型改为由同一闭环内的咒语造成的任何其他类型。",
	"If the spell grants its target at saving throw, you may choose to change the type of saving throw to one required by another spell within the same closed loop.": "如果该咒语赋予其目标以蓄力，你可以选择将蓄力的类型改为同一闭环内的另一个咒语所要求的类型。",
	"For example, if you cast a {@spell fireball} spell linked to the same closed loop as {@spell phantasmal killer}, you may choose to deal psychic damage instead of fire damage. Alternatively, you may switch the Dexterity saving throw required by fireball for a Wisdom saving throw instead, as required by phantasmal killer.": "例如，如果你施放了一个与(%%)相同的闭环的{@spell fireball}法术，你可以选择造成精神伤害而不是火灾伤害。或者，你可以将火球术所要求的灵巧救赎换成智慧救赎，正如幻影杀手所要求的那样。",
	"Starting at 10th level, the spells at the edges of your spell map bleed into the world around you. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher positioned at a terminal in your spell map, you and all allies within 30 feet gain temporary hit points equal to the spell's level.": "从10级开始，你的法术地图边缘的法术会渗入你周围的世界。当你施展位于你的法术地图中的终端的1级或更高等级的法术时，你和30英尺内的所有盟友都会获得与该法术等级相等的临时命中率。",
	"Beginning at 14th level, the contours of your spell map can draw power from the aether. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, place a token over that spell's position on your spell map. If this spell is not connected to the last spell you covered with a token, remove any tokens you have previously placed. If the number of tokens on your spell map is then equal to that spell's level plus one, you may choose not to expend a spell slot when you cast the spell. If you do, remove all the tokens from your spell map.": "从14级开始，你的法术地图的轮廓可以从乙太中汲取力量。当你施放一个1级或以上的巫师法术时，在你的法术地图上该法术的位置上放置一个信物。如果这个法术与你用令牌覆盖的最后一个法术没有联系，则移除你之前放置的任何令牌。如果你的法术图上的令牌数量当时等于该法术的等级加一，你可以选择在施放该法术时不消耗一个法术槽。如果你这样做了，就从你的法术地图中移除所有的标记。",
	"You remove all tokens from your spell map when you finish a short rest or a long rest.": "当你完成短时休息或长时休息时，你会从你的法术地图中移除所有的标记。"
