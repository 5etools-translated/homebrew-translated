	"The College of the Hand was created to help empower by a famous bard who lost her hearing. However, her journey before creating the college was one of hardship and perseverance.": "手部学院是由一位失去听力的著名吟游诗人创建的，以帮助增强能力。然而，在创建学院之前，她的旅程是一个艰难和坚持不懈的过程。",
	"Through the use of advanced somatic components called spell signs she created a way to help those like her continue their paths even in the face of adversity.": "通过使用被称为 \"咒语符号 \"的先进体质成分，她创造了一种方法，帮助那些像她一样的人在逆境中继续他们的道路。",
	"I created this subclass specifically for playing a deaf character. There are a lot of mechanical disadvantages that go into playing a deaf character in 5E and this is made to balance that while still allowing a unique experience.": "我专门为扮演聋人角色创建了这个子类。在5E中，扮演聋人角色有很多机械上的不利因素，而这个子类是为了平衡这些不利因素，同时还能提供独特的体验。",
	"With that I would suggest a few things be done to accommodate a deaf character.": "在此，我建议做几件事来适应聋哑人的角色。",
	"Knows their languages, but can't speak them (unless they became deaf later). I suggested giving them lip reading and/or sign language (which may not be understood by everyone, but that's just another \"flavor enhancer\"). Maybe even giving them the {@feat Observant} Feat as an option. Also, in character charades is fun AF.": "知道他们的语言，但不能说出来（除非他们后来变成聋子）。我建议给他们读唇语和/或手语（可能不是每个人都能理解，但这只是另一种 \"增味剂\"）。也许甚至可以给他们{@feat Observant}的能力作为一个选项。另外，在角色中猜字谜也很有趣。",
	"This sub can only be taken at level 3 so there are two levels beforehand where the characters spell casting is negatively impacted. This isn't all that bad as they don't get a massive amount of spells, but I suggest the character has 1-2 \"mastered\" spells they can cast without verbal components.": "这个子项只能在第3级服用，所以在这之前有两个级别的角色施法会受到不利影响。这并不完全是坏事，因为他们没有得到大量的法术，但我建议这个角色有1-2个 \"精通 \"的法术，他们可以在没有语言成分的情况下施放。",
	"While the character may be deaf, the player may not be. Come to an understanding about how the character's actions are communicated. Stress that while the character may not speak, the player can still narrate their meaning and actions to the party and DM (should the players understand them anyway).": "虽然角色可能是聋子，但玩家可能不是。就角色的行动如何交流达成共识。强调尽管角色可能不会说话，但玩家仍然可以向党和DM叙述他们的意思和行动（如果玩家能理解他们的话）。",
	"The flavorful meat that can really make a bard unique. I suggest adding the ability to use the characters sign language in addition to music. If you haven't seen someone sign the words \"You're Awesome\" with a smile on their face then you are truly missing out on some real Inspiration.": "味道鲜美的肉，可以真正使吟游诗人与众不同。我建议在音乐之外，增加使用人物手语的能力。如果你没有见过有人面带微笑地打出 \"你真棒 \"的手语，那么你就真的错过了一些真正的灵感。",
	"When you join the College of the Hand at 3rd level you gain the ability to replace some physical components of spells with somatic gestures called spell signs. You may replace the verbal component of any bard spell you know with somatic gestures instead.": "当你在3级时加入手部学院，你就获得了用称为咒语符号的体态手势来代替咒语的某些物理成分的能力。你可以用体态手势代替你知道的任何吟游诗人法术的语言成分。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, you are taught the more advanced form of a useful bit of magic. You learn the {@spell mage hand} cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of bard cantrips you know.": "从3级开始，你会被教导一种更高级的有用的魔法形式。你学会了{@spell mage hand}咒语，它不计入你所知道的吟游诗人咒语的数量。",
	"Additionally, if you cast this cantrip with two free hands then you instead gain two mage hands for the duration of the spell. Both hands can be controlled in concert or for two separate purposes as one action. ": "此外，如果你用两只自由的手来施展这个咒语，那么在咒语的持续时间内你会获得两只法师的手。两只手可以一起控制，或者作为一个动作用于两个不同的目的。",
	"Upon reaching 6th level, the ability to sense the world around you via vibrations is at your fingertips. You may expend a use of Bardic inspiration to gain tremorsense for one round for a number of feet equal to the number rolled times 10.": "达到6级后，通过振动感知周围世界的能力就在你的指尖。你可以使用吟游诗人的灵感来获得震颤感，持续一回合，持续的距离等于所滚动的次数乘以10。",
	"Beginning at 14th level, you have learned the colleges most powerful spell signs. Whenever you cast a spell using a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level slot, if you have two free hands then the spell counts as being cast one level higher.": "从14级开始，你已经学会了最强大的法术符号。每当你使用一阶、二阶或三阶的插槽施法时，如果你有两只空闲的手，那么该法术就算是高一阶的施法。",
	"Additionally, you no longer need to hold an instrument to use it as an arcane focus.": "此外，你不再需要拿着乐器来作为一个奥术焦点使用。"
