	"Adistant time ago, blue flame ravaged the lands as The Weave tore itself apart. Towering flames shaped and changed Faerun for better and for worst. Many users of magic perished, as their spells were like fuel to the fire that raged across the lands. Those that were engulfed in it, and called upon magic near it, paid a terrible price. It has been years since, but there are rumors that essences of the Spellplague remaining, tiny corners in the world that still host a flickering blue flame, any that go near them, or cast spells near them, runs the risk of becoming Spellscarred.": "很久以前，蓝色的火焰蹂躏着这片土地，因为 \"编织 \"将自己撕裂了。高耸的火焰塑造并改变了法云，无论好坏。许多使用魔法的人都死了，因为他们的法术就像火上浇油一样，在这片土地上肆虐。那些被火吞噬的人，以及在火附近召唤魔法的人，都付出了可怕的代价。已经过去了很多年，但有传言说咒语瘟疫的精髓仍然存在，世界上的一些小角落仍然有闪烁的蓝色火焰，任何接近它们的人，或在它们附近施法的人，都有可能成为咒语者。",

	"A spellscar has different effects on its wielder based on how it was attained. Were you tossed into the flame, brought your hand just too close to it, or were you born within sight of it. Spellscars do not always grant the powers of a sorcerer, but may give small yet not worthy abilities.": "咒语车对它的持有者有不同的影响，这取决于它是如何获得的。你是被扔进火焰里，还是手离它太近，或者你生来就在它的视线之内。咒语车并不总是赋予巫师的力量，但可能会赋予小而不值的能力。",
	"You can apply these features to the sorcerer: {@i Reaching Embers},  {@i Bite of the Blue Burn},  {@i Eyes of Revealing Fire}": "你可以对巫师应用这些功能：（%0%），（%1%），（%2%）。",

The options are limitless.": "咒语瘟疫只在《被遗忘的国度》中被提及，但一个有咒语的人可能来自其他途径。在魔法实验室里发生的可怕事故，一个不那么有爱心的赞助人的礼物，或者只是一觉醒来就有了。选择是无限的。",

The only definite in the future of a Spellscarred, is that there is no changing back.": "那些知道你的标记的人可能会避开你，或试图研究你，因为你的种类是如此稀少。也有一些人可能会崇拜你，旨在接近你，或者很可能杀了你，因为他们知道你身上的力量不仅古老，而且强大。在法术之神的未来，唯一确定的是，没有人可以改变。",
	"The spellscar counts as a curse on a creature, but cannot be removed with spells such as {@spell remove curse|PHB}, even the {@spell wish|PHB} spell cannot save you from this, as the fire feeds off of magic itself and only will work against the magic that tries to fight it.": "法术卡算作对生物的诅咒，但不能用{@spell remove curse|PHB}等法术去除，即使是{@spell wish|PHB}法术也不能救你于水火，因为火焰以魔法本身为食，只会对试图对抗它的魔法起作用。",
