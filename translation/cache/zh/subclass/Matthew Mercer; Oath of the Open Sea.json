	"The Oath of the Open Sea calls to sea-faring warriors, swashbuckling sailors, and journeying guardians who seek the thrill of an endless horizon. Driven to seek the adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath stand against those who would deny the liberties afforded to likeminded travelers, rooting out the tyrannical and corrupt that claim any shore. Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities like the Wild Mother or Storm Lord that influence safe passage, while often feeling called to hunt those monstrosities that seek to terrorize and spoil the waters with wanton violence and ill intent.": "公海之誓呼唤着航海的战士，勇敢的水手，以及寻求无尽地平线的刺激的旅行守护者。驱使他们在每一片无尽的海洋上和下面寻找冒险和神秘，宣誓的圣骑士们反对那些拒绝给予志同道合的旅行者自由的人，并根除那些声称在任何海岸的暴君和腐败分子。这些守护者相信大海的自然之美，经常向影响安全通行的实体或神灵（如野性之母或风暴之主）供奉和祈祷，同时经常感到被召唤去猎杀那些企图以肆意暴力和恶意破坏水域的怪物。",
