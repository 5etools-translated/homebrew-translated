	"Understanding your dreams is to peek into a wider reality, occupied by spaces and beings scarcely imaginable to the waking mind. Clerics of Dreams venerate nameless, ancient gods that slumber unseen, whose very dreams send ripples throughout the multiverse. They feel the presence of these beings in their own dreams, and are unshakable in their conviction that they will one day awaken.": "理解你的梦境就是窥探一个更广阔的现实，它被清醒的头脑几乎无法想象的空间和生命所占据。梦想教士崇敬无名的古老神灵，他们沉睡在看不见的地方，他们的梦在整个多元宇宙中激起涟漪。他们在自己的梦中感受到了这些生命的存在，并坚定不移地相信他们有一天会醒来。",
	"You understand that there is precious little difference between the visions we have when asleep and the wishes that consume us while awake, for the world that we live in is but a dream that we share. Ultimately, the power of one's dreams can supplant reality, for the two are not so different.": "你明白，我们睡觉时的幻觉和清醒时的愿望之间没有什么区别，因为我们生活的世界不过是我们共同的梦。最终，一个人的梦想的力量可以取代现实，因为两者并无太大区别。",
	"At 1st level, you can interpret the symbolism of a dream to learn what sort of fears, concerns, or prophecy inspired it. If a dream originates due to fear or stress on the part of the dreamer, you can gain insight into its reasoning, its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates.) If the dream is divine in origin, the dreamtelling acts as a {@spell commune} spell, with the question asked relating to a great fear or concern of the dreamer. After interpreting the dreams of a creature, you have advantage on Charisma checks you make against it for 1 hour.": "一级时，你可以解释一个梦的象征意义，以了解什么样的恐惧、担忧或预言激发了它。如果一个梦是由于做梦者的恐惧或压力而产生的，你可以洞察它的推理，它的情绪状态，以及在它心中占据重要地位的东西（比如它担心的、爱的或恨的东西）。在解释了一个生物的梦之后，你在对其进行魅力检查时有优势，持续1小时。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity as an action to force a creature you can see within 60 feet to fall into a deep magical sleep. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall {@condition unconscious} for up to 1 minute. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed automatically succeed this saving throw. The creature can reattempt this saving throw with advantage when it takes damage.": "从2级开始，你可以使用你的 \"通道神性 \"作为一个动作，迫使60英尺内你能看到的一个生物陷入深度的魔法睡眠。这个生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作，否则就会倒下（%0%），时间长达 1 分钟。亡灵和对被魅惑免疫的生物会自动成功地做出这个蓄力动作。当该生物受到伤害时，它可以重新尝试这个蓄力动作，并获得优势。",
	"By 6th level, when you place a creature into a slumber, they toss and turn in the anguish of a fever dream. When a creature that is unconscious due to your Slumber feature begins its turn, you can choose for it to take {@damage 3d6} psychic damage. It does not reattempt its saving throw due to this damage. You do not kill the creature due to this damage; you can only reduce it to 1 hit point.": "到6级时，当你让一个生物进入沉睡状态时，他们会在热梦的痛苦中辗转反侧。当一个因你的沉睡特性而失去意识的生物开始它的回合时，你可以选择让它受到（%0%）精神伤害。它不会因为这个伤害而重新尝试它的救赎动作。你不会因为这个伤害而杀死这个生物，你只能将它的命中率降低到1点。",
	"Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.": "从第8级开始，你在使用任何牧师咒语的伤害上加上你的智慧修饰。",
	"By 17th level, you can step through the world of dreams. In a ritual requiring 1 minute of concentration, choose a creature known to you that is currently sleeping on the same plane as you. You can become a messenger in the creature's dreams, as per the spell {@spell dream}, though you cannot make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying. You can then teleport to the creature's bedside.": "到17级时，你可以穿越梦境。在一个需要集中注意力1分钟的仪式中，选择一个你认识的、目前正与你在同一平面上睡觉的生物。你可以成为该生物梦中的信使，就像法术（%0%）一样，不过你不能让信使显得畸形和恐怖。然后你可以传送到该生物的床边。"
