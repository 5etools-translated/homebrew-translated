Vials of holy water, acid, oil, alchemist's fire, poison, or any other substance may be shot from a flask launcher. A launched vial shatters on impact with a target, dealing 1d4 slashing damage in addition to the effects of the vial's contents.

	"At 1st level, your placement and composition of your internal organs is bizarre. You take no additional damage from critical hits.": "一级时，你的内脏器官的位置和组成都很奇怪。你从关键打击中不会受到额外的伤害。",
	"At 6th level, your body becomes more fluid. You can shift your features around and make yourself look differently while you maintain concentration on the change. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the physical change is up to you.": "在第6级，你的身体变得更加流畅。你可以在保持注意力集中在变化上的同时，将你的五官移来移去，让自己看起来不一样。你可以看起来矮一英尺或高一英尺，可以看起来很瘦，很胖，或者在两者之间。你不能改变你的体型，所以你必须采用一种具有相同的四肢基本排列的形式。否则，身体变化的程度由你决定。",
	"Additionally, you can expend 2 sorcery points to compress your body enough to squeeze through an inch-wide crack. You cannot expand inside a space that offers any resistance, such as an occupied suit of armor.": "此外，你可以消耗2个巫术点来压缩你的身体，足以挤过一英寸宽的裂缝。你不能在有任何阻力的空间内扩张，例如一件被占用的盔甲。",

	"Only the most powerful angels, short of truly divine beings, are mighty enough to forge such a pact. Additionally, the terms of this pact differ from the zeal of a paladin or cleric. Perhaps warlockhood is a means to save your damned soul, or perhaps it is to repay a debt owed to the gods. Whatever the reason, you are less the apostle, and more the servant.": "只有最强大的天使，而不是真正的神性存在，才有足够的力量缔结这样的契约。此外，这种契约的条款与圣骑士或牧师的热忱不同。也许成为术士是拯救你那被诅咒的灵魂的一种手段，也许是为了偿还欠下诸神的债务。不管是什么原因，你都不是使徒，而更像是仆人。",

It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is incapacitated and can't move for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell), as the chains hold its limbs to the ground.

	"Graceful, exotic, and lethal, the rare bards who commit to learning battledancing are nimble combatants, revered in legend. Their motions appear to be as random as they are agile, but those are the steps of a lethal dance played out according to their own rhythm. It is a beautiful dance of predator and prey, of whirling blades and hapless victim.": "优雅、异国情调和致命，很少有吟游诗人致力于学习搏击舞，他们是灵活的战斗人员，在传说中受到尊敬。他们的动作看起来很随意，也很敏捷，但这些都是按照他们自己的节奏进行的致命舞蹈的步骤。这是一个捕食者和猎物的美丽舞蹈，是旋转的刀片和无助的受害者。",
