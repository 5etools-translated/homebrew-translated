	"Ask ten bards from any part of the realms where bardcraft came from, and you'll more than likely get 12 distinctly different answers. Some say that the various musical instruments and spells used by Bard's came from the different planes in ways not unlike the ways wizardly and divine magic made their way to Faerun in the early days of its existence. Regardless, Bardcraft has shown itself to be a way to access the vast arcane powers of The Weave through the power of song in a way that is distinctly different from arcane and diving schools of thought. In time, bardcraft eventually organized itself into the schools and colleges that are known throughout Faerun today. At least, on the surface of Faerun.": "问十个来自任何地方的吟游诗人，吟游技艺从何而来，你很可能得到12个截然不同的答案。有人说，吟游诗人使用的各种乐器和法术来自不同的位面，其方式与法隆存在初期的巫师和神圣魔法进入法隆的方式并无二致。不管怎么说，吟游诗人已经显示出自己是一种通过歌曲的力量来获取《编织》的巨大奥秘力量的方式，这与奥术和潜水学派有明显不同。随着时间的推移，巴德克特最终将自己组织起来，形成了今天在整个法隆闻名的学校和学院。至少，在法隆的表面。",
	"While it does not exactly mirror the world above it, Faerun's Underdark has its own peoples, cities and cultures that have their own take on arcane, divine, and yes, bardic magic based on the properties of the Underdark and the deities that its denizens worship. This includes the most notorious of Underdark residents, the drow, and the exceedingly rare form of bardcraft embedded in their own culture, that of the ancient drow sect, the Bae'qeshel Telphraezzar, The Whisperers Of The Dark Queen.": "虽然它并不完全照搬上面的世界，但Faerun的地下城有它自己的民族、城市和文化，根据地下城的特性和其居民崇拜的神灵，对奥术、神术，还有吟游诗人的魔法有自己的看法。这包括最臭名昭著的地下城居民--乌鸦，以及蕴含在他们自己的文化中的极其罕见的吟游诗术，即古老的乌鸦教派，Bae'qeshel Telphraezzar，黑暗女王的低语者。",
	"It is speculated that the Bae'qeshel Telphraezzar originated in the ancient Ilythiiri city of Atorrnash and that the archmage Ka'Narlist had sponsored the growth of (under the not so subtle influence of Lolth) these dark bards as a way to promote the worship of Lolth over Ghaunadaur in the ancient dark elf city. After the Fourth Crown War and the Ilythiiri were banished to the Underdark, forever being known as the dhaerow (traitors), only a small group of these dark minstrels remained as drow culture began to become more centered around the divine communion with Lolth that it is known for today.": "据推测，Bae'qeshel Telphraezzar起源于古老的Ilythiiri城市Atorrnash，大法师Ka'Narlist赞助了这些黑暗吟游诗人的成长（在Lolth不那么微妙的影响下），作为在古老的黑暗精灵城市促进对Lolth的崇拜而不是Ghaunadaur的方式。在第四次王室战争之后，伊莱西里人被放逐到暗黑世界，永远被称为dhaerow（叛徒），只有一小群这样的黑暗吟游诗人留下来，因为乌鸦文化开始变得更加以与洛神的神性交流为中心，而这正是它今天所知道的。",
	"As the drow society matured and created academies for its wizards, swordsmen and clergy, the bae'qeshel remained a small secret sect of minstrels that kept their existence out of the public drow eye. As drow society became more matriarchal, study of the bae'qeshel lore became limited to females and even then, was passed down from one bae'qeshel in a house to another, only inducting one dark whisper into what had become a secret sisterhood once per generation.": "随着乌鸦社会的成熟，并为其巫师、剑客和神职人员创建了学院，bae'qeshel仍然是一个小型的秘密吟游诗人教派，他们的存在不被公众所关注。随着乌鸦社会变得更加母系化，对bae'qeshel传说的研究变得仅限于女性，即使如此，也是由一个家族中的bae'qeshel传给另一个家族，每一代人中只有一个暗语者进入这个已经成为秘密的姐妹会。",
	"While calling the ways of the Dark Minstrels a 'bardic college' may be a misnomer at this point, its practices are spreading and may result in a formal school or guild related to this style of bardcraft establishing itself in time.": "虽然称黑暗吟游诗人的方式为 \"吟游诗人学院 \"在目前可能是一种误解，但其做法正在蔓延，并可能导致与这种吟游艺术风格相关的正式学校或公会在一段时间内成立。",
	"The Bae'Qeshel is a young baric college that still has strong ties to drow culture. As such, its songs have yet to be translated into the common tongue and can currently only be properly commanded in elvish. Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit your campaign. The restriction reflects the story of the Bae'Qeshel in the author's version of the Forgotten Realms, but it might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.": "Bae'Qeshel是一个年轻的巴洛克学院，与鸦人文化仍有密切的联系。因此，它的歌曲还没有被翻译成普通话，目前只能用精灵语正确指挥。你的管理员可以取消这一限制，以更好地适应你的活动。这个限制反映了作者版本的《被遗忘的王国》中Bae'Qeshel的故事，但它可能不适用于你的DM设定或你的DM版本的王国。",
	"When you choose this college at 3rd level, you learn songs that are fueled by bardic inspiration dice.": "当你在3级选择这个学院时，你会学习由吟游诗人灵感骰子驱动的歌曲。",
	"You use your Bae'Qeshel songs at the cost of your Bardic Inspiration dice. An inspiration die is expended when you use it for a Bae'Qeshel song or for the use of your Bardic Inspiration ability. The number of Bardic Inspiration dice you get, their size, as well as when you replenish them follow the same rules for the Bard Class as mentioned in the Player's Handbook.": "你使用你的Bae'Qeshel歌曲时，需要消耗你的吟游诗人灵感骰子。当你将一个灵感骰子用于Bae'Qeshel歌曲或使用你的吟游诗人灵感能力时，它就被消耗了。你得到的吟游诗人灵感骰子的数量，它们的大小，以及你何时补充它们，都遵循《玩家手册》中提到的吟游诗人等级的相同规则。",

You regain the use of this ability when you finish a long rest.": "在14级时，你能够以牺牲你的生命力为代价，利用你灵魂中的音乐来激发你的Bae'Qeshel魔法。当你的吟游诗人灵感能力不再使用时，你可以使用一个动作将你的命中率转换成你的吟游诗人灵感能力的使用，但以你可用的命中率为准。你以这种方式重新获得的吟游诗人灵感的最大使用次数等于你的魅力修正值。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得这个能力的使用。",
