	"The tradition of the Shrouded Arts is one not well known by the general populace, and its practitioners prefer to keep it that way. Blending arcane techniques of illusion and enchantment, shrouds have honed their skills to excel in covert operations: infiltration, espionage, stealth and subterfuge. An experienced shroud can infiltrate a castle, sabotage an outpost, or steal critical documents, all without raising suspicion.": "遮蔽艺术的传统并不为大众所熟知，其从业者也更愿意保持这种状态。融合了幻觉和魔法的神秘技术，裹尸布磨练了他们的技能，使他们在秘密行动中表现出色：渗透、间谍、隐身和潜行。一个有经验的裹尸布可以潜入一座城堡，破坏一个前哨站，或偷取关键文件，而不会引起怀疑。",
	"The powers of subterfuge granted by this tradition draw students from across the moral spectrum. Some shrouds align themselves with noble causes, working alone or with clandestine organizations to expose corruption or learn the plans of mighty villains. Others exploit their abilities to plunder hidden secrets, using them to gain power. A few simply adopt the Shrouded Arts out of necessity, seeing them as the only way to survive in places where use of arcane, or unsanctioned, magic is outlawed.": "这一传统所赋予的潜规则的力量吸引了来自不同道德领域的学生。有些人将自己与崇高的事业结合起来，单独工作或与秘密组织合作，揭露腐败或了解强大的恶棍的计划。其他人则利用他们的能力来掠夺隐藏的秘密，利用它们来获得权力。少数人只是出于需要而采用裹尸布艺术，将其视为在使用奥术或未经批准的魔法被禁止的地方生存的唯一途径。",
	"Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, your mental and physical conditioning allow you to conceal your spellcasting from others. When you cast a wizard spell, you don't need to provide verbal components for it as long as you can provide somatic components.": "从你在2级时选择这个传统开始，你的精神和身体条件允许你向他人隐瞒你的法术。当你施展巫师法术时，只要你能提供身体的成分，你就不需要为它提供语言成分。",
	"Additionally, the current contents of your spellbook, as well as any spells you learn by gaining wizard levels, are committed to memory. Your memory is considered a spellbook. You can add spells to your memory as you would a spellbook by spending time and gold as normal, to utilize mnemonic tools and purchase research materials.": "此外，你的法术书的当前内容，以及你通过获得巫师等级而学习的任何法术，都会被记入记忆。你的记忆被认为是一本法术书。你可以通过花费正常的时间和金币，利用记忆工具和购买研究材料，将法术添加到你的记忆中，就像你在法术书中一样。",
	"Also at 2nd level, you can befuddle a creature's mind with nothing but a gesture. As an action, you can force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, you can force the creature to forget a single aspect of a conversation, observation or encounter it had, that you know of, in the past 10 minutes, such as your physical appearance, a question it was asked, or a short action an ally performed. A {@spell remove curse} or {@spell greater restoration} spell cast on the creature can restore its memory to normal. Whether the creature succeeds or fails their saving throw, you can't use this feature on them again until you finish a long rest.": "同样在2级，你可以只用一个手势来迷惑一个生物的思想。作为一个动作，你可以强迫30英尺范围内你能看到的生物对你的巫师法术救赎DC做一个智慧救赎。如果救赎失败，你可以强迫该生物忘记它在过去10分钟内的谈话、观察或遭遇的一个方面，你知道的，比如你的外貌，它被问到的问题，或者一个盟友执行的简短行动。对该生物施以{@spell remove curse}或{@spell greater restoration}的法术可以将其记忆恢复到正常。无论该生物是成功还是失败，你都不能再对其使用此功能，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能的次数等于你的智力修饰值（最小为1）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得任何已消耗的使用次数。",
	"At 6th level, you can erase yourself from a creatures sight momentarily. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, you become {@condition invisible} to the creature for 1 minute, or until you affect it with a spell or attack.": "在6级时，你可以将自己从一个生物的视线中瞬间抹去。作为一个额外的行动，选择一个在你60英尺内的生物。该生物必须对你的巫师法术救赎DC做一个智慧救赎。如果救赎失败，你会在1分钟内变成该生物的0%，或者直到你用法术或攻击影响它。",
	"Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期的休息。",
	"At 10th level, you can change your appearance on a whim, mimicking the personas of others. You can cast {@spell disguise self} at will, without expending a spell slot. When you cast disguise self this way, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter or taller than normal, and if you disguise yourself as a humanoid you've observed for at least an hour, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to impersonate them.": "10级时，你可以随心所欲地改变你的外表，模仿他人的角色。你可以随心所欲地施展（%0%），而不需要消耗一个法术槽。当你以这种方式施展自我伪装时，你可以看起来比正常人矮3英尺或高3英尺，如果你把自己伪装成一个你观察了至少一个小时的类人，你在模仿他们的魅力检查中具有优势。",
	"At 14th level, you've learned how to weave the Shroud of Oblivion, a cloak of powerful enchantment and illusion magic. As an action, you can don the shroud for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:": "在14级时，你已经学会了如何编织 \"遗忘之罩\"，一件带有强大魔法和幻觉的斗篷。作为一个动作，你可以在1小时内穿上这块斗篷。在持续时间内，你会获得以下好处。",
	"Creatures that see you during that time can't recall your physical appearance, your mannerisms, or any other identifying features.": "在那段时间里看到你的生物无法回忆起你的外貌，你的举止，或任何其他识别特征。",
	"Creatures that interact with you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC once the interaction ends. You can choose to exclude a creature from this effect. On a failed save, the creature forgets all details of the interaction, rationalizing any of its outcomes. A {@spell remove curse} or {@spell greater restoration} spell cast on the creature can restore its memory to normal.": "与你互动的生物必须在互动结束后对你的巫师法术救赎DC做一个智慧救赎。你可以选择将一个生物排除在这个效果之外。如果救赎失败，该生物会忘记互动的所有细节，使其任何结果合理化。对该生物施以{@spell remove curse}或{@spell greater restoration}的法术可以将其记忆恢复到正常。",
	"Spells you cast can't be perceived by spells, features and effects that detect or react to magic, unless you choose otherwise, and leave no magical trace.": "你所施展的法术不能被探测魔法或对魔法有反应的法术、特征和效果所感知，除非你另有选择，并且不留下任何魔法痕迹。",
	"Once you've used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。"
