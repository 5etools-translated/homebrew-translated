	"Ur-Priests are scarcely clerics in the traditional sense; many even despise the gods. Rather than being granted divine magic and authority by a deity or powerful idea, clerics of the Ur Domain siphon off the energies granted by gods to divine spellcasters, using it for their own needs without giving even lip-service to any god. Ur-Priests can come from any walk of life, but the most dangerous are always ex-clerics and paladins who have abandoned their gods. They violently oppose religion in any form, and use their powers to weaken the gods and destroy their followers.": "乌尔祭司几乎不是传统意义上的神职人员；许多人甚至蔑视神灵。乌尔领域的牧师不是由神灵或强大的理念授予神圣的魔法和权力，而是抽走神灵授予神圣施法者的能量，将其用于自己的需要，甚至不对任何神灵进行口头承诺。乌尔祭司可以来自各行各业，但最危险的总是那些抛弃了他们的神的前神职人员和圣骑士。他们激烈地反对任何形式的宗教，并利用他们的力量来削弱神灵，摧毁他们的追随者。",
	"Starting at 1st level, when you prepare spells following a long rest, you can select one spell to prepare from any list of cleric domain spells, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. This spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. At 8th level, you may prepare 2 spells in this way, and at 17th level, you may prepare 3.": "从1级开始，当你在长时间休息后准备法术时，你可以从任何一个牧师领域的法术列表中选择一个法术来准备，而且它不计入你每天可以准备的法术数量。这个法术的等级必须是你有法术槽的。8级时，你可以用这种方式准备2个法术，17级时，你可以准备3个。",
	"At 1st level, you have advantage on saving throws against divine spells, which are spells cast by clerics, paladins, druids, rangers, celestials, and other sources the DM deems appropriate.": "在1级时，你对神圣的法术有优势，这些法术是由牧师、圣骑士、德鲁伊、游侠、天人和其他DM认为合适的来源施放的。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to invert positive energy into negative energy.": "从2级开始，你可以使用你的通道神性将正能量转换为负能量。",
	"As a bonus action, you create a 60-foot-radius aura centered on you for one minute or until you dismiss it using another bonus action. Within this aura, no creature can magically regain hit points. If a creature were to regain hit points, it instead must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking necrotic damage equal to the hit points it would have regained on a failed save.": "作为一个额外的行动，你创造一个以你为中心的60英尺半径的光环，持续一分钟或直到你用另一个额外行动将其解除。在这个光环内，任何生物都不能以魔法方式恢复生命值。如果一个生物要重新获得命中率，它必须在宪法规定的救赎中获得成功，如果救赎失败，它将受到相当于命中率的坏死伤害。",
	"Starting at 6th level, you can expend two spell slots of the same level to cast a spell as if you were using a single spell slot that is one level higher than the slots being expended.": "从6级开始，你可以消耗两个相同等级的法术槽来施法，就像你使用比所消耗的法术槽高一个等级的单一法术槽一样。",
	"Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.": "从第8级开始，你在使用任何牧师咒语的伤害上加上你的智慧修饰。",
	"At 17th level, you learn how to siphon magic from spellcasters just as you do with the gods. When targeted by a spell, you can use your reaction to prepare the spell until you complete a long rest. The spell is considered a cleric spell for you, but does not count against the number of spells you can prepare.": "17级时，你学会了如何从施法者身上吸取魔力，就像你对神灵一样。当被一个法术瞄准时，你可以用你的反应来准备这个法术，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。该法术对你来说被认为是一个牧师法术，但不计入你能准备的法术数量。",
	"A spell prepared in this manner is removed from your list of prepared spells if this feature is used again.": "以这种方式准备的法术，如果再次使用此功能，会从你准备的法术列表中移除。"
