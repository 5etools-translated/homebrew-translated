	"Starting at 1st level, your discussions of the future with yourself have given you some periphery knowledge about how events played out. When you take a short or long rest, your DM rolls a d20 in secret and records the number rolled. Your DM can disclose the value, keep it a secret, or lie about its value. You can replace any ability check you make with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll and can only use this recorded value once.": "从1级开始，你与自己对未来的讨论已经给了你一些关于事件如何发生的外围知识。当你进行短期或长期休息时，你的DM会秘密地掷出一个D20，并记录掷出的数字。你的DM可以公开这个数值，对它保密，或者对它的数值撒谎。你可以用这一卷来代替你的任何能力检查。你必须在掷骰子之前选择这样做，并且只能使用这个记录的数值一次。",
	"At 6th level, your future self often warns you of particular attacks to watch out for. When you are targeted by an attack you can use your reaction to gain a +10 bonus to AC against that attack.

	"At 14th level, your knowledge of the future allows you to exploit some of the rules of spacetime. As an action, you can cause that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you goad the creature into causing a paradox. For {@dice 1d6} rounds the creature is {@condition incapacitated}, locked between two opposing states while the paradox sorts itself out. The creature is unaffected on a successful save. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "14级时，你对未来的了解使你能够利用一些时空规则。作为一个行动，你可以使该生物做出智力救赎的动作。如果救赎失败，你会诱导该生物造成一个悖论。在{@dice 1d6}回合内，该生物会被{@condition incapacitated}锁定在两个对立的状态之间，而悖论会自行解决。如果拯救成功，该生物将不受影响。一旦你使用了这个特性，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",

	"At 3rd level, you can send attacks across timelines. When you use the {@action Attack} action on your turn to make a weapon attack, you can make a second attack against the target. The attack originates from the location you were standing when you began your last turn. If the target is out of range, there is no line of sight to the target from this location, or other conditions make this attack impossible, the attack misses. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of this bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.": "三级时，你可以跨越时间线发送攻击。当你在你的回合中使用{@action Attack}动作进行武器攻击时，你可以对目标进行第二次攻击。攻击起源于你开始最后一个回合时所站的位置。如果目标不在范围内，从这个位置没有视线到目标，或者其他条件使这次攻击不可能，那么这次攻击就会失败。你不会在这次额外攻击的伤害中加入你的能力修改器，除非该修改器是负的。",

	"At 15th level as a reaction when you are attacked or are targeted by a spell, you can defensively step forward in time, vanishing completely. This attack or spell has no effect on you. During the next round, you effectively do not exist, and can't be perceived or targeted by effects. At the beginning of your following turn, you reappear within 5 feet of where you vanished. After using this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.": "在15级时，作为一种反应，当你被攻击或被法术攻击时，你可以防御性地在时间上向前迈进，完全消失。这个攻击或咒语对你没有影响。在下一回合中，你实际上并不存在，也不能被感知或被效果锁定。在你下一个回合开始时，你会在你消失的地方的5英尺范围内重新出现。在使用这个能力后，你必须完成一个短暂或长时间的休息才能再次使用它。"
