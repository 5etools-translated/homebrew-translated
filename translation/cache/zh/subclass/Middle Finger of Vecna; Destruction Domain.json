	"Some gods revel only in the crushing of walls and the burning of cities. The gods of destruction - such as Bane, Erythnul, Sirrion, and Maglubiyet - train their clerics to oppose the forces of creation. These deities need not be evil, but have a strong tendency toward chaos and enforcing the eternal cycle of death and rebirth.": "有些神只陶醉于击溃城墙和焚烧城市。毁灭之神--如贝恩、埃里瑟努尔、瑟里昂和马格鲁比耶特--训练他们的神职人员来反对创造之力。这些神灵不一定是邪恶的，但有强烈的混乱倾向，并强制执行死亡和重生的永恒循环。",
	"Clerics who follow gods of destruction often have a deep personal connection with their chosen deity. In some cases, they were spared from destruction in order to wreak it upon others; in others, they have pleaded with the god for priesthood to destroy a single foe; other still simply worship their god out of fear.": "追随毁灭之神的教士往往与他们选择的神灵有着深厚的个人联系。在某些情况下，他们从毁灭中幸免于难，以便对他人进行毁灭；在另一些情况下，他们向神恳求神职，以消灭一个敌人；还有一些人只是出于恐惧而崇拜他们的神。",
	"At 1st level, you gain proficiency with one {@filter martial melee weapon|items|source=null|category=basic|type=martial weapon;melee weapon=sand} and one {@filter martial ranged weapon|items|source=null|category=basic|type=martial weapon;ranged weapon=sand} of your choice.": "在1级时，你获得对你选择的一个（%0%）和一个（%1%）的熟练度。",
	"At 1st level, you learn two {@filter evocation cantrips|spells|level=0|school=E} of your choice which count as cleric cantrips for you.": "一级时，你学会了两个你选择的（%0%）算作你的牧师咒语。",
	"By 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can visit destruction on a single creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Armor Class is reduced by 4 for 1 minute, or is reduced by 2 on a successful save.": "到2级时，作为额外行动，你可以对60英尺内你能看到的单一生物进行破坏。这个生物必须做一个宪法救赎的动作。如果救赎失败，该生物的护甲等级将减少4，持续1分钟，如果救赎成功则减少2。",
	"Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage to a creature with a spell, you can expend one cleric spell slot to deal bonus radiant damage to one creature that took damage from the spell. The extra damage is {@damage 2d6} for a 1st-level spell slot, plus {@dice 1d6} for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of {@dice 5d6}.": "从6级开始，当你用法术对一个生物造成伤害时，你可以消耗一个牧师法术槽，对一个受到该法术伤害的生物造成额外的辐射伤害。一级法术槽的额外伤害是{@damage 2d6}，加上高于一级的每一个法术等级的{@dice 1d6}，最大为{@dice 5d6}。",
	"At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.": "8级时，你在使用任何牧师咒语的伤害上加上你的智慧修饰。",
	"Beginning at 17th level, when you cast a cleric spell that deals damage, it ignores damage resistances. If a creature is immune to a damage dealt by your spell, it is treated as only having resistance against it. Additionally, your spells deal double damage against objects.": "从17级开始，当你施展牧师法术造成伤害时，会忽略伤害抗性。如果一个生物对你的法术造成的伤害是免疫的，它将被视为只对它有抗性。此外，你的法术对物体造成双倍伤害。"
