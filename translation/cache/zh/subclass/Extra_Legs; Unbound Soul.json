	"Sometimes, when mortals are born, by intense magical disruption or by rare chance, the mortal's soul can be seperate from their body. Although these people can seem ordinary, a wisp of light seems to follow them wherever they go. The bond between your body and your separated soul is a crack, through which magic can seep into you from between the planes. .": "有时，当凡人出生时，由于强烈的魔法干扰或罕见的机会，凡人的灵魂可以从他们的身体中分离出来。虽然这些人可能看起来很普通，但无论他们走到哪里，一缕光似乎都会跟着他们。你的身体和你分离的灵魂之间的联系是一个裂缝，通过这个裂缝，魔法可以从各个星球之间渗入你的身体。.",
	"At 1st level, your soul is unbound from your body. It takes the form of a small, ethereal, floating light which normally orbits or flits around you. It is not a creature or object. It naturally stays in the same position as you, though you can move your soul to any point within 15 feet of you or call it back to you as a bonus action. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, your soul follows you so that it remains within 15 feet of you. You can cast your spells as though you were in the soul's position, though you must use your own senses to do so. You can also use the soul as your spellcasting focus. You are immune to being posessed. The soul sheds dim light in a 10 foot radius, and you can activate or deactivate this light as an action.": "在1级时，你的灵魂从你的身体中解脱出来。它的形式是一个小的、空灵的、漂浮的光，通常在你周围绕行或飞翔。它不是一个生物或物体。它自然地与你保持相同的位置，尽管你可以将你的灵魂移动到你周围15英尺内的任何地方，或者作为一个额外动作将它召唤回来。如果你离开它超过20英尺，你的灵魂会跟随你，使它保持在你的15英尺之内。你可以像在灵魂的位置上一样施展你的法术，尽管你必须使用你自己的感官来这样做。你也可以使用灵魂作为你的施法焦点。你对被附身是免疫的。灵魂在10英尺的范围内发出昏暗的光，你可以用行动来激活或停用这种光。",
	"In addition, the energy of the bond connecting you to your soul helps to protect you from harm. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your Sorcerer level, rounded up.": "此外，连接你和你灵魂的纽带的能量有助于保护你免受伤害。每当你完成一次短时或长时休息，你都会获得相当于你巫师等级一半的临时命中率，四舍五入。",
	"From 1st level, as an action you can cause your body to fall into a catatonic state for up to a minute, for which time your consciousness is transferred to your soul. You are aware of your surroundings as though you were in the soul's space. You can't take actions or reactions, but you can move the soul, which is ethereal and has a flying speed of 30 feet. For the duration, your soul can move up to 120 feet from you. You can end the effect at any time, causing your soul to immediately return to you. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.": "从第一层开始，作为一个动作，你可以使你的身体陷入紧张状态长达一分钟，在这段时间内你的意识被转移到你的灵魂。你会意识到你周围的环境，就像你在灵魂的空间里一样。你不能做出行动或反应，但你可以移动灵魂，它是空灵的，飞行速度为30英尺。在持续时间内，你的灵魂可以在离你最多120英尺处移动。你可以在任何时候结束这个效果，使你的灵魂立即回到你身边。一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"At 6th level, you can tether yourself to a creature using your soul. As an action, you can expend 2 sorcery points to tether yourself to a willing creature within 15 feet of you for up to 1 minute. Your soul remains in that creature's space for the duration, regardless of distance. While you are tethered, whenever that creature takes damage you can use your reaction to reduce the damage they take by half your Sorcerer level, and whenever it deals damage you can use your reaction to increase damage dealt by half your Sorcerer level. You can end this effect as a bonus action.": "在6级时，你可以用你的灵魂把自己拴在一个生物身上。作为一个行动，你可以消耗2个巫术点将自己拴在15英尺范围内一个愿意的生物身上，持续1分钟。你的灵魂在持续时间内保持在该生物的空间里，无论距离有多远。当你被拴住时，每当该生物受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应来减少他们所受的伤害，减少的程度为你的巫师等级的一半，而每当它造成伤害时，你可以用你的反应来增加所受的伤害，增加的程度为你的巫师等级的一半。你可以作为一个额外的行动结束这个效果。",
	"In addition, you learn to further utilise the strong bond between you and your soul. You can expend 1 sorcery point as a bonus action on your turn to teleport to your soul's location if it is in an unoccupied space. You can still take this bonus action while using Projection.": "此外，你还学会了进一步利用你和你的灵魂之间的强大联系。如果你的灵魂在一个无人的空间里，你可以在你的回合中消耗1个巫术点作为奖励动作，传送到你的灵魂所在地。在使用 \"投射 \"的时候，你仍然可以采取这个奖励行动。",
	"At 14th level, you learn how to push your soul into other creatures. When you use your Projection, you can expend 3 sorcery points to co-possess a willing creature within 5 feet of your soul. Your soul enters its body for up to 1 hour. For the duration, your soul can be any distance from you, and you are blind and deaf to your surroundings. You instead share the senses of whichever host creature you are co-posessing, and the host maintains control of its body. However, for the duration, you can take an action on each of your turns to control the creature, but cannot move or take bonus actions, and your own body cannot take actions. When you control a host creature in this way, you can cast your Sorcerer spells from its position using your statistics, but otherwise you must use the host's statistics for actions you take. If you cast a spell with a range of self, it affects the host creature. If the host creature takes any damage, you take psychic damage equal to the damage they take. This effect ends early if the creature becomes incapacitated or if you or the creature ends it as a bonus action. When this effect ends, your soul immediately moves back to your body.": "14级时，你学会了如何将你的灵魂推入其他生物体内。当你使用你的投射术时，你可以消耗3个巫术点数，在你的灵魂5英尺范围内共同占有一个自愿的生物。你的灵魂会进入它的身体，时间长达1小时。在这段时间内，你的灵魂可以与你保持任何距离，并且你对周围的环境视而不见、听而不闻。你会分享你所共同拥有的宿主生物的感官，而宿主则保持对其身体的控制。然而，在持续时间内，你可以在你的每个回合采取一个行动来控制该生物，但不能移动或采取额外行动，你自己的身体也不能采取行动。当你以这种方式控制一个宿主生物时，你可以在它的位置上使用你的统计数据来施展你的巫师法术，但除此之外，你必须使用宿主的统计数据来进行你的行动。如果你施放的法术的范围是自己，它就会影响到宿主生物。如果宿主生物受到任何伤害，你会受到与他们所受伤害相等的精神伤害。如果该生物失去能力，或者你或该生物以奖励行动的方式结束该效果，则该效果提前结束。当这个效果结束时，你的灵魂立即移回你的身体。",
	"At 18th level, you are able to temporarily fuse a fragment of your soul into your body as a bonus action, bringing the magical bond between you to a peak for one minute. When you cast a spell of during this time, you can use an additional metamagic option on the spell, and your cantrips deal an additional die of damage.": "在18级时，你能够将你的灵魂碎片暂时融合到你的身体中，作为一个额外动作，使你们之间的魔力结合达到顶峰，持续一分钟。当你在这段时间内施展法术时，你可以在法术上使用一个额外的法术选项，并且你的咒语会造成额外的伤害。",
	"Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest.": "一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成了长时间的休息。"
