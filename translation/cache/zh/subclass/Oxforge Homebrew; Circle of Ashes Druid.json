	"Druids of this circle believe that what's old and rotten must be burned down for something better to arise from its ashes. A member of this circle may have become a druid in a forest prone to wildfires or near the site of a mighty volcano.": "这个圈子的德鲁伊相信，旧的和腐烂的东西必须被烧掉，以便从灰烬中产生更好的东西。这个圈子的成员可能是在容易发生野火的森林里或靠近强大火山的地方成为德鲁伊的。",
	"Regardless of their origin, these druids know that many things in this world stagnate, cease to grow, or even corrupt and deteriorate. They see the value of fire as a force of creative destruction; a way to destroy the old to make way for something better. Some druids of this circle revere the phoenix as the symbol of the cycle of death, decay and regrowth. Others make a habit out of planting seeds on fallen foes so new life can bloom from their ashes.": "不管他们的出身如何，这些德鲁伊知道这个世界上的许多东西都会停滞不前，停止生长，甚至腐败和恶化。他们认为火的价值是一种创造性的破坏力；一种摧毁旧事物为更好的事物让路的方法。这个圈子的一些德鲁伊崇尚凤凰，认为它象征着死亡、腐烂和再生的循环。其他人则习惯于在倒下的敌人身上种下种子，以便新的生命能从他们的灰烬中绽放。",
	"Your attunement to fire infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to additional spells. These spells are always prepared, don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day, and they are considered druid spells for you.": "你对火的调和为你注入了施展某些法术的能力。在3级、5级、7级和9级时，你可以获得额外的法术。这些法术总是被准备好的，不计入你每天可以准备的法术数量，而且它们被认为是德鲁伊的法术。",
	"When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn to accelerate the natural cycle of death, decay, and regrowth. When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see takes fire damage, you can use your reaction to seed the ashes with life. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or become {@condition restrained} by magical plants which erupt from the wound, lasting until the end of your next turn.": "当你在2级选择这个圈子时，你学会了加速死亡、腐烂和再生的自然循环。当你周围60英尺内的生物受到火灾伤害时，你可以用你的反应来给灰烬种上生命。它必须在对你的法术救赎DC的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会被从伤口处喷出的魔法植物所感染，持续到你下一回合结束。",
	"If the target takes fire damage while {@condition restrained} this way, the plants combust, releasing the creature. The target and each creature within a 10 foot radius centered on the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A target takes {@dice 1d8} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.": "如果目标在这样的情况下受到火灾伤害，植物会燃烧，释放出生物。目标和以目标为中心的10英尺范围内的每个生物必须对你的法术救赎DC做一个灵巧的救赎。如果救赎失败，目标会受到1%的火力伤害，如果救赎成功，则会受到一半的伤害。",
	"This combustion's damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 6th level ({@dice 2d8}), 10th level ({@dice 3d8}) and 14th level ({@dice 4d8}).": "当你达到6级（{@dice 2d8}）、10级（{@dice 3d8}）和14级（{@dice 4d8}）时，这种燃烧的伤害增加{@dice 1d8}。",
	"You can use this feature a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能的总次数等于你的智慧修改器（最少一次），并且在你完成长时间休息后恢复所有消耗的使用。",
	"{@italic {@variantrule optional class features|tce|Optional feature}, which replaces the Cycle of Ash feature}": "{@italic {@variantrule optional class features|tce|Optional feature}，取代了灰烬循环的功能}。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you learn to speed up the cycle of death, decay and regrowth. Whenever a creature dies within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to instantly grow a tree up to 10 foot high from its corpse, regardless of the underlying terrain. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to grow a tree from a dead creature or a pile of at least half a gallon of ash.": "从2级开始，你学会加快死亡、腐烂和再生的循环。每当一个生物在你60英尺范围内死亡，你可以用你的反应从它的尸体上立即长出一棵树，最高可达10英尺高，而不管下面的地形如何。或者，你可以使用一个额外的动作，从一个死去的生物或一堆至少半加仑的灰烬中长出一棵树。",
	"When you deal fire damage to a tree created in this way, you can choose to have it combust. Creatures and objects within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or or take {@dice 2d8} fire damage.": "当你对以这种方式创造的树木造成火伤时，你可以选择让它燃烧。在它周围10英尺内的生物和物体必须对你的法术救赎DC进行灵巧的救赎，否则就会受到{@dice 2d8}的火焰伤害。",
	"The combustion's damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 6th level ({@dice 3d8}), 10th level ({@dice 4d8}) and 14th level ({@dice 5d8}).": "当你达到6级（{@dice 3d8}）、10级（{@dice 4d8}）和14级（{@dice 5d8}）时，燃烧的伤害增加{@dice 1d8}。",
	"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses on a short or long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能的次数等于你的智慧修改器。你在短时或长时的休息中恢复所有消耗的使用。",
	"Starting at 6th level, your eyes burn with a radiance that cuts through anything that might impede your vision. You gain {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have {@sense darkvision} from another feature, its range increases by 30 feet. You can see normally through fog, gas, and smoke, including heavily obscured areas created by spells such as {@spell fog cloud}, but not magical darkness.": "从第6级开始，你的眼睛燃烧着光芒，可以穿透任何可能阻碍你视野的东西。你获得（%0%），范围为60英尺。如果你已经从其他功能中获得了（%1%），其范围会增加30英尺。你可以透过雾、气体和烟雾，包括由法术产生的严重遮蔽区域，如{@spell fog cloud}，但不包括神奇的黑暗。",
	"In addition, you gain the ability to tap into the history of burned things. When you come across a burned object, wound or corpse, you can use your action to touch it and learn approximately when it was burned and whether the fire was magical or not.": "此外，你还获得了挖掘被烧毁事物的历史的能力。当你遇到一个被烧毁的物体、伤口或尸体时，你可以用你的行动去触摸它，并了解它大约是什么时候被烧毁的，以及火是否有魔力。",
	"If you use this feature on a corpse, you can choose to relive the last 10 minutes of its conscious experience before death. This can only work if the creature's body was set ablaze before its moment of death, and after using this feature you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.": "如果你对一具尸体使用这个功能，你可以选择重温它死前最后10分钟的意识体验。这只有在该生物的身体在死亡前被点燃的情况下才能起作用，而且在使用这个功能后，你不能再这样做，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you become a master over wildfires. As an action, you can put out any nonmagical fires of your choice within 30 feet of you.": "从10级开始，你成为野火的主人。作为一项行动，你可以扑灭你周围30英尺范围内你所选择的任何非魔法的火。",
	"In addition, a layer of protective ash covers your skin, making you resistant to fire and lightning damage, and you can breathe normally in nonmagical smoke and ash.": "此外，一层保护性的灰烬覆盖在你的皮肤上，使你能抵抗火灾和闪电的伤害，你可以在非魔法的烟雾和灰烬中正常呼吸。",
	"Starting at 14th level, you learn to emulate the flight and rebirth of the phoenix. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, wings of fire erupt from your back. You gain a flying speed equal to your current speed until the end of your turn.": "从14级开始，你学会模仿凤凰的飞行和重生。每当你施展一个一级或更高等级的造成火焰伤害的法术时，火翼就会从你的背部喷发出来。你获得一个与你当前速度相等的飞行速度，直到你的回合结束。",
	"Additionally, when you die, your body erupts into flame and turns to ash. The ash is put under the effects of the {@spell gentle repose} spell and collected in a flame red egg of glass. Unless the ashes have been dispersed, you rise from your ashes after {@dice 1d4} days as if {@spell true resurrection} had been cast on you. At the moment of death, you choose whether the equipment you are carrying is left behind or disintegrated along with your body. In the latter case, you have all the equipment you had at the moment of death when you are reborn. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until 14 days have passed.": "此外，当你死亡时，你的身体会爆发出火焰，变成灰烬。灰烬被置于{@spell gentle repose}法术的作用下，并被收集在一个火焰红的玻璃蛋中。除非灰烬已被驱散，否则你会在{@dice 1d4}天后从灰烬中复活，就像{@spell true resurrection}被施于你一样。在死亡的那一刻，你可以选择你所携带的装备是被留下还是与你的身体一起瓦解。在后一种情况下，当你重生时，你拥有死亡时的所有装备。一旦你使用这个功能，在14天过去之前，你不能再这样做。"
