	"It is a common misconception that the members of demon-worshiping cults are all mindless slaves, crazed hedonists, or violent murderers. The truth is that many of them are perfectly sane, with dreams of enslaving demons for themselves, rather than the other way around. A select few are even strong enough to do so, rising through the ranks of their cult to become powerful priests and summoners, capable of calling upon armies of fiends and mortals alike to do their bidding.": "一个常见的误解是，崇拜恶魔的邪教成员都是无意识的奴隶、疯狂的享乐主义者或暴力杀人犯。事实是，他们中的许多人都非常理智，梦想着为自己奴役恶魔，而不是反其道而行之。少数人甚至强大到足以做到这一点，他们通过邪教的等级晋升，成为强大的祭司和召唤师，能够召唤恶魔和凡人的军队来为他们服务。",
	"When you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use dark magic to siphon power from dying creatures. Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. Furthermore, whenever you reduce a willing creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your cleric level plus twice your Wisdom modifier and have advantage on the first attack roll you make in the next minute. Creatures that you have summoned or dominated are always considered to be willing for the purposes of this ability.": "当你在1级选择这个领域时，你可以使用黑暗魔法从垂死的生物身上吸取力量。每当你将一个敌意的生物减少到0命中率时，你就会获得相当于你的智慧修正值的临时命中率。此外，每当你将一个自愿的生物降低到0命中率时，你就会获得相当于你的牧师等级加两倍你的智慧修正值的临时命中率，并且在接下来的一分钟内你所做的第一次攻击卷轴上具有优势。就这个能力而言，你所召唤或支配的生物总是被认为是自愿的。",
	"Also at 1st level, the experience you have gained dealing with cunning fiends and treacherous cultists equips you well for future conflicts. Whenever you make a contested ability check against a creature, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to the roll.": "同样在1级时，你在对付狡猾的恶魔和奸诈的邪教徒方面获得的经验使你在未来的冲突中得到很好的装备。每当你对一个生物进行有争议的能力检查时，你可以将你的熟练度加成两倍。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your offensive spells, the better to unleash the infinite chaos of the Abyss on your foes.": "从2级开始，你可以使用你的通道神性来增强你的攻击性法术，以便更好地对你的敌人释放深渊的无限混乱。",
	"When you cast a spell that deals damage to one or more creatures, you can use your Channel Divinity to add your Wisdom modifier to the damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is disintegrated into a fine grey dust, along with anything it is wearing or carrying (except for magic items). The creature can be restored to life only by means of a {@spell true resurrection} or a {@spell wish} spell.": "当你施展一个对一个或多个生物造成伤害的法术时，你可以使用你的通道神性，将你的智慧修饰值加到伤害上。任何被此法术降低到0命中率的生物都会被分解成细小的灰色灰尘，连同它所穿戴或携带的任何东西（魔法物品除外）。该生物只能通过{@spell true resurrection}或{@spell wish}的法术来恢复生命。",
	"Any Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force that would be hit by the spell is also disintegrated.": "任何会被法术击中的大型或小型非魔法物体或魔法力量的创造物也会被瓦解。",
	"At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to chain demons to your will. When you cast a spell that summons demons, you present your holy symbol and use your Channel Divinity to bind them. Any demons bound in this way cannot break free from your control, and are never hostile towards you or your allies. The binding ends when you die.": "在6级时，你可以使用你的通道神性将恶魔锁在你的意志之下。当你施展召唤恶魔的法术时，你会出示你的神圣符号并使用你的通道神性来束缚它们。任何以这种方式束缚的恶魔都无法挣脱你的控制，并且永远不会对你或你的盟友产生敌意。束缚在你死亡时结束。",
	"At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.": "8级时，你在使用任何牧师咒语的伤害上加上你的智慧修正值。",
	"When you reach 17th level, you infuse your soul with demonic energy, gaining immense power. You have resistance to cold, fire and lightning damage, and gain telepathy with a range of 120 feet.": "当你达到17级时，你将自己的灵魂注入恶魔能量，获得巨大的力量。你对寒冷、火焰和雷电伤害有抵抗力，并获得120英尺范围的心灵感应。"
