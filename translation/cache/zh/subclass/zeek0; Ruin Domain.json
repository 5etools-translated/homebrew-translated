	"Ruin is more and less than physical annihilation - something ruined has been left without value or is otherwise perverted. Gods of ruin—such as Barbatorum, The Devourer, Talos, Tharizdun, and Shiva—are agents of destruction and dissolution. They seek a more permanent state of decline in the world; that forces of destruction should always howl against the forces of creation. Followers of these gods may wish for only devastation of some object, idea, or system with no designs of creation. Others wish for a future of growth and uplift, but know that their part is only to precipitate loss and defeat.": "毁灭比物理上的毁灭更多，也更少--被毁灭的东西已经没有了价值，或者被扭曲了。毁灭之神--如Barbatorum、The Devourer、Talos、Tharizdun和Shiva--是毁灭和解体的代理人。他们寻求世界上更持久的衰落状态；毁灭的力量应该永远对创造的力量发出嚎叫。这些神的追随者可能只希望对某些物体、思想或系统进行破坏，而没有创造的打算。其他人则希望有一个增长和提升的未来，但他们知道自己的职责只是催生损失和失败。",
	"At 1st level, your god imbues your magic with greater powers to demolish and destroy. Damage you deal to objects with spells is doubled.": "一级时，你的神赋予你的魔法以更大的拆毁和破坏能力。你用法术对物体造成的伤害会翻倍。",
	"Also at 1st level, you are blessed with greater abilities to dissolve social and civil bonds. You gain proficiency in {@skill Deception}, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill.": "同样在1级时，你被赋予了更大的能力来解除社会和民间的联系。你获得了对（%0%）的熟练度，并且在你进行任何使用该技能的能力检查时，你的熟练度奖励都会翻倍。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your channel divinity to create a field of accelerated entropy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the natural powers of reduction and fragmentation. For one minute, enemy creatures within 60 feet gain half the number of hit points or temporary hit points they would otherwise gain. In addition, when a creature or object within range takes damage you can use your reaction to cause them to take an additional amount of force damage equal to {@dice 1d8} + half your cleric level (rounded down).": "从第二层开始，你可以使用你的通道神性来创造一个加速的熵场。作为一个动作，你出示你的神圣符号，并唤起减少和分裂的自然力量。在一分钟内，60英尺范围内的敌方生物会获得他们原本会获得的命中率或临时命中率的一半。此外，当范围内的生物或物体受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应使它们受到相当于{@dice 1d8}+你牧师等级一半的额外力量伤害（向下取整）。",
	"At 6th level, you may use your channel divinity to bring low your enemies' abilities of creation, thought, and deed. As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and each enemy creature within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a target immediately loses concentration and has disadvantage on ability checks for one minute. At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.": "在6级时，你可以使用你的通道神性来降低你的敌人的创造、思想和行为的能力。作为一个额外的动作，你展示你的神圣符号，在30英尺范围内的每个敌人都必须对你的法术保存区进行智慧拯救。拯救失败后，目标会立即失去注意力，并在一分钟内对能力检查产生不利影响。在每个回合结束时，受影响的生物可以再次进行智慧救赎。如果成功，则效果结束。",
	"Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.": "从第8级开始，你在使用任何牧师咒语的伤害上加上你的智慧修饰。",
	"At 17th level, you can fracture and shatter the power of your enemies. When a creature within 30 feet would use a spell, action, or ability to deal damage, you can use your reaction to force the enemy creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save that damage is negated, and damage caused by that spell, action, or ability is halved for 24 hours. If the damage source is a weapon it is sundered in this way until it is repaired, unless it is an artifact. On a successful save that damage is halved, with no lingering effects. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "在17级时，你可以使你的敌人的力量断裂和破碎。当30英尺内的生物会使用法术、行动或能力造成伤害时，你可以用你的反应迫使敌方生物对你的法术救赎DC进行宪法救赎。如果救赎失败，该伤害将被抵消，并且该法术、行动或能力造成的伤害将在24小时内减半。如果伤害源是一件武器，它就会以这种方式被破坏，直到它被修复，除非它是一件神器。在救治成功的情况下，该伤害减半，没有挥之不去的影响。一旦你使用了这个特性，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。"
