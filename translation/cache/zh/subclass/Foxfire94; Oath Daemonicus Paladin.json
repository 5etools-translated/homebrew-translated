	"For some, simply dedicating their souls to the gods is not enough. Pledging themselves fully they allow daemons to possess their bodies, becoming willing hosts to these immaterial creatures. To any who can see it, this appears as two souls occupying one body; as the daemon has its own defining personality, goals and voice in your character's head. In battle, this being comes to dominate your mind and body, hands turn into rending talons and jaws into slavering, fang-filled maws that are twisted beyond reason and reality.": "对于一些人来说，仅仅把自己的灵魂献给诸神是不够的。他们将自己完全承诺，允许守护神占有他们的身体，成为这些非物质生物的自愿主人。对任何能看到它的人来说，这就像两个灵魂占据了一个身体；因为守护神在你的角色的脑海中有自己明确的个性、目标和声音。在战斗中，这种生物会支配你的思想和身体，手会变成撕扯的爪子，下巴会变成贪婪的、充满獠牙的大嘴，扭曲得超越了理性和现实。",
