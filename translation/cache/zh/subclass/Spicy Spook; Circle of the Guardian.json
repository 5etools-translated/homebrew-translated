	"Druids are worshippers of nature, able to weave its primeval power into mighty spells that bend the elements of the natural world to their will and transform into all manner of beasts. There are some druids however who see a different path to that power. Instead of transforming into beasts, they choose to embody the steadfast strength of the forest, the interconnected web of life that shields its inhabitants, and the ever nurturing boons of its fruits, channeling their druidic power to embody those aspects. Those within the Circle of the Guardian, also known as greenkeepers or emerald knights, literally cloak themselves in nature itself, becoming mighty bulwarks and protectors of all living things.": "德鲁伊是自然的崇拜者，能够将自然的原始力量编织成强大的法术，使自然界的元素屈服于他们的意志，并转化为各种形式的野兽。然而，也有一些德鲁伊看到了通往这种力量的不同道路。他们不选择变身为野兽，而是选择体现森林的坚定力量、保护其居民的相互关联的生命之网，以及其果实不断滋养的恩惠，引导他们的德鲁伊力量来体现这些方面。守护者圈子里的人，也被称为绿色守护者或绿宝石骑士，实际上是将自己隐身在大自然中，成为强大的壁垒和所有生物的保护者。",

	"This protective form tends to resemble whatever natural elements it is formed out of; be it hard tree bark and thick vines in a forested area, jagged ice and frozen rock in a boreal environment or a shell of hardened sand and sun-bleached stone in a desert. Ultimately, you determine the form's appearance.": "这种保护性形态往往类似于它所形成的任何自然元素；无论是森林地区坚硬的树皮和茂密的藤蔓，还是北方环境中锯齿状的冰和冰冻的岩石，或是沙漠中硬化的沙子和被阳光晒过的石头的外壳。最终，你决定了该形式的外观。",
