	"To ensure victory over even the most savage foes, these implacable men and women have spent long years researching a monastic tradition with unlimited potential—the art of blue magic. Clothed in distinctive blue-and-black jubbahs and wielding curved blades, the Blue Mages are feared for their ability to harness a creature's strength and add it to their own. Blue magic is an art that allows a person to mimic the awesome powers of monsters and far exceed the normal boundaries of mortals.": "为了确保战胜最野蛮的敌人，这些坚忍不拔的男人和女人花了很长时间研究一种具有无限潜力的寺院传统--蓝色魔法的艺术。蓝色法师身穿独特的蓝黑相间的jubbahs，挥舞着弯曲的刀片，他们因能够驾驭生物的力量并将其加入自己的力量而令人畏惧。蓝魔法是一种艺术，它允许一个人模仿怪物的可怕力量，并远远超过凡人的正常界限。",
	"However, a blue mage uses the techniques of beasts in the form of a person, placing enormous strain on his or her physical self. And while the magical process of absorbing a monster's essence into oneself has reduced the occurrence of physical incidents, there is an increased danger of a blue mage succumbing mentally and spiritually to the beast within...": "然而，蓝法师以人的形式使用野兽的技术，给他或她的身体带来巨大的压力。虽然将怪物的精髓吸收到自己体内的神奇过程减少了身体事故的发生，但蓝衣法师在精神和灵魂上屈服于内心的野兽的危险却在增加......",
	"Few blue mages in history have ever reached the end of his or her natural lifespan, and this speaks eloquently of the pain they endure despite improvements to their art. There is even talk of a blue mage who absorbed the essence of an undead creature and can no longer be released from his mortal coil.": "历史上很少有蓝衣法师达到他或她的自然寿命的终点，这雄辩地说明了尽管他们的艺术得到了改进，但他们所忍受的痛苦。甚至还有人说，一个蓝衣法师吸收了一个不死生物的精华，再也无法从他的凡间释放出来。",
	"Only those with the strength of spirit to resist the savage call of the beast within—and those willing to sacrifice a future to carry out their duty—have the necessary qualities to walk the path of the blue mage.": "只有那些有精神力量来抵抗内心野兽的野蛮召唤的人，以及那些愿意牺牲未来来履行职责的人，才有必要的素质来走蓝袍法师的道路。",
	"Starting when you choose this Origin at 1st level, your unique physiology allows you to absorb and permanently learn to use spells and monster abilities. When you are the target of a spell or a monster's non-weapon ability, you may use your reaction to attempt to learn that ability.": "从你在1级选择这个起源开始，你独特的生理机能使你能够吸收并永久地学习使用法术和怪物的能力。当你成为一个法术或一个怪物的非武器能力的目标时，你可以用你的反应来尝试学习该能力。",
	"Make a Concentration check. If the ability causes damage, the DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If the ability does not cause damage, the DC equals 8 + the creature's proficiency bonus.": "做一个集中力检查。如果该能力造成伤害，DC等于10或你所受伤害的一半，以较高的数字为准。如果该能力不造成伤害，则DC等于8+该生物的熟练度加成。",
	"On a success, you may add the ability to your list of Azure Lore. You may only know a number of Lore abilities equal to {@b half your Sorcerer Level (rounded down) + Proficiency Bonus}. If learning new Lore would cause you to exceed this maximum, you may choose a Lore ability you know and replace it with the new one.": "成功后，你可以将该能力加入你的蔚蓝传说列表中。你只能知道等于（%0%）的罗尔能力。如果学习新的传说会导致你超过这个上限，你可以选择一个你知道的传说能力，并用新的能力来代替它。",
	"You may not learn an ability from a monster whose Challenge Rating exceeds your level in the Sorcerer class. You cannot learn lair or legendary abilities.": "你不能从挑战等级超过你巫师等级的怪物身上学习能力。你不能学习巢穴或传奇的能力。",
	"After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "使用这个能力后，你不能再使用它，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"You may cast any ability from your list of Azure Lore as if it were a Sorcerer Spell.": "你可以从你的蔚蓝传说列表中施放任何能力，就像它是一个巫师法术一样。",
	"Non-spell abilities on your list of Azure Lore must be cast by expending a spell slot of an appropriate level, determined by the Challenge Rating of the creature you learned it from, as noted in the table below. This table should be used as a guideline; the DM may choose to raise or lower the required spell slot level at his or her discretion based on the relative power of the learned ability.": "你的蔚蓝传说清单上的非法术能力必须通过消耗一个适当等级的法术槽来施放，这个法术槽由你所学生物的挑战等级决定，如下表所示。此表应作为指导原则；DM可以根据所学能力的相对力量，酌情选择提高或降低所需的法术槽等级。",
	"You do not need to provide any material components for spells or abilities cast in this way, unless they are costly.": "你不需要为以这种方式施放的法术或能力提供任何物质成分，除非它们是昂贵的。",
	"Abilities learned this way may be affected as normal by Metamagic once you've gained that feature at 3rd level.": "一旦你在3级时获得该特性，通过这种方式学习的能力可能会受到变态魔法的正常影响。",
	"When you choose this Origin at 1st level, you gain proficiency with longswords, scimitars, and light armor. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. If you lack proficiency in the required skill, you are treated as having it only for the purposes of these monster knowledge checks. (Proficiency bonus would not be doubled in this case).": "当你在一阶选择这个起源时，你获得对长剑、弯刀和轻甲的熟练度。在你为识别怪物和它们的特殊能力或弱点而进行的任何能力检查中，你的熟练度加成会加倍。如果你缺乏所需技能的熟练度，你将被视为拥有该技能，只是为了进行这些怪物知识检查。(在这种情况下，熟练度奖励不会翻倍）。",
	"At 6th level, you gain the ability of Arcane Consumption. The Blue Mage can attempt to learn passive or defensive abilities from creatures by eating parts of them. Some blue mages eat the creature's heart, others the brain. The specific part of the creature consumed doesn't appear to matter, only that the blue mage believes the magic he wishes to take lies within.": "6级时，你获得奥术消耗的能力。蓝法师可以尝试通过吃生物的一部分来学习生物的被动或防御能力。有些蓝法师吃生物的心脏，有些则吃大脑。被吃掉的生物的具体部位似乎并不重要，只是蓝袍法师相信他想要获取的魔法在其中。",
	"Consuming a corpse in this manner takes at least 10 minutes and requires you to spend 1 Sorcery Point. Make a Constitution saving throw, the DC for which equals 8 + the creature's proficiency bonus + the creature's Constitution modifier. On a success, you learn the ability as if it were gained with Azure Lore. Otherwise you are sick and vomit up the corpse which is ruined.": "以这种方式消耗一具尸体至少需要10分钟，并且需要你花费1个巫术点。做一个体质救赎动作，其DC等于8+生物的熟练度加成+生物的体质修正值。如果成功，你就能学到这个能力，就像用Azure Lore获得的一样。否则你会生病并吐出被毁坏的尸体。",
	"You add this ability to your Azure Lore. Each passive ability costs 1 Sorcery point to maintain, reducing the available Sorcery points by that amount. These abilities are always 'on' and cannot be turned off to regain access to the reserved Sorcery points. The blue mage's form often changes to reflect the abilities learned. For example, if you gain the natural base armor of the Galeb Duhr, then your skin can take on a rocky appearance.": "你将此能力添加到你的蔚蓝传说中。每个被动能力都需要消耗1个巫术点来维持，并减少可用巫术点的数量。这些能力总是处于 \"开启 \"状态，无法关闭以重新获得保留的巫术点数。蓝袍法师的形态经常改变以反映所学到的能力。例如，如果你获得了加勒布-杜尔的天然基础护甲，那么你的皮肤就会呈现出岩石般的外观。",
	"Through your study of spells and monsters, at 14th level you gain the ability to quickly assess and counter the effects of a spell you can see. You may cast Counterspell without expending a spell slot. You may increase the level of this spell by expending 4 Sorcery Points per level. After using this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.": "通过对法术和怪物的研究，在14级时你获得了快速评估和反击你能看到的法术效果的能力。你可以在不消耗法术槽的情况下施展反击术。你可以通过每级消耗4点巫术点数来提高这个法术的等级。在使用这个能力后，你不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"At 18th level, though still limited in the number of powers you can have, passive abilities no longer require Sorcery Points to maintain, freeing up those Sorcery points for other uses. Your ability to learn Azure Lore is no longer limited by CR. You may now also learn legendary abilities.": "在18级时，虽然你能拥有的力量数量仍然有限，但被动能力不再需要巫术点数来维持，从而释放出这些巫术点数用于其他用途。你学习Azure Lore的能力不再受到CR的限制。你现在也可以学习传说中的能力。"
