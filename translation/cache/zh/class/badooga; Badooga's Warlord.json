	"The ironclad centaur and her allies are the only ones left standing after the kraken's devastating assault. Having calculated most possible courses of action, the centaur lets out a shout and charges forward. Using her spear to deflect as many tentacles as possible, the centaur draws the kraken's ire so that her allies can position themselves behind the kraken's weak spot.

	"Passing through a dense fog, a leather-bound shifter guides a party of adventurers through the swamps. Hearing cries of pain, the shifter approaches to find an injured man leaned against a tree. Noticing the arrow lodged in his shoulder, the shifter steadies their breath and draws their shortsword. Amidst the man's wincing and the rushing water of the nearby stream, the shifter hears the subtle twang of a shortbow being knocked.

When the party wizard stands up from their prone position, they find an arrow lodged in the tree next to where their head would have been.": "穿过一片浓雾，一个皮包骨的变身者引导着一队冒险者穿过沼泽。听到痛苦的呼喊声，转移者走近一看，发现一个受伤的人靠在树上。注意到箭插在他的肩膀上，移形换影者稳住呼吸，拔出短剑。在那人的抽噎声和附近小河的流水声中，移位者听到了短弓被敲击的微妙的响声。他们发出了一声高亢的哨声，党员们立刻知道要躲避。当聚会的巫师从他们的俯卧姿势站起来时，他们发现一支箭插在了他们的头旁边的树上。",
	"Having fought for days on end, the leonin's breastplate is all but shattered. She and her soldiers are weary, and are starting to be beaten back by the hydra's relentless attacks. But the leonin refuses to accept defeat. Letting out a mighty roar, the leonin's overwhelming presence causes the hydra to recoil for a brief window of time. In this time, the leonin delivers a few short sentences that inspire hope and resolve in the hearts of her comrades. By the time the hydra shakes off the effect, it finds that the soldiers that stand before it have become even stronger than they were before the battle began.": "连续作战数日，列宁的胸甲几乎被打碎了。她和她的士兵们都很疲惫，并开始被九头蛇无情的攻击所击退。但利奥宁拒绝接受失败。发出强大的吼叫声，利安人压倒性的存在使九头蛇在短暂的时间内退缩了。在这段时间里，利安人说了几句简短的话，激发了她的战友们的希望和决心。当九头蛇摆脱这种影响时，它发现站在它面前的士兵已经变得比战斗开始前更加强大。",
