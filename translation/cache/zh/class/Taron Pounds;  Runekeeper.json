	"Ponderers of ancient and unchanging truths, runekeepers gain their powers through the contemplation and bending of the laws of reality, for runes are not some mere alphabet, but sacred and infallible diagrams of the plan of creation. As the name suggests, runekeepers are the preservers and torchbearers of this knowledge. Not only do they keep this wisdom alive, but it is their burden to also protect others from its potential dangers. If the runes call upon you, the following sections detail everything you need to play a runekeeper.": "符文看守人是古老而不变的真理的领航者，他们通过对现实法则的思考和弯曲来获得力量，因为符文不是一些单纯的字母，而是创造计划的神圣而无误的图示。顾名思义，符文管理人是这种知识的保存者和火炬手。他们不仅要保持这种智慧的活力，而且还有责任保护他人免受其潜在的危险。如果符文召唤你，以下章节将详细介绍你扮演符文守护者所需要的一切。",
	"Whereas a paladin's spells are granted through a sacred oath and a cleric's devotion to their deity grants them an understanding of divine magic, the runekeeper's runes are a manifestation of sacred laws of reality, making them something of divine philosophers. As wards of runic truth, it's not uncommon for some communities to take in runekeepers as priests. Homes might bear a signature rune of such a priest on their doors, jewelers may make pendants of the rune as protective charms, and the particularly devout may wear them on their robes or as tattoos.": "圣骑士的法术是通过神圣的誓言授予的，而牧师对他们的神灵的献身则授予他们对神圣魔法的理解，符文看守人的符文是现实的神圣法则的表现，使他们成为神圣的哲学家。作为符文真理的守护者，一些社区收留符文管理员作为祭司的情况并不少见。家里的门上可能会有这样一个牧师的签名符文，珠宝商可能会把符文做成吊坠作为保护符，而特别虔诚的人可能会把符文穿在长袍上或作为纹身。",
	"Magic has always been intrinsically tied into the spoken and written word. Verbal incantations are required to cast most spells, spell scrolls and spellbooks are themselves capable of carrying the power of the spells they describe, even speaking the name of certain devils can be enough to banish them back to the Hells. This is more than just folklore and superstition, words have power, and runekeepers may be thought of as the ancestral onomancers in worlds where the magic of names plays such a key role.": "魔法总是与口头和书面语言有着内在的联系。口头咒语是施展大多数法术的必要条件，法术卷轴和法术书本身就能够携带它们所描述的法术的力量，甚至说出某些魔鬼的名字也足以将它们驱逐回地狱。这不仅仅是民间传说和迷信，文字是有力量的，在名字的魔力发挥如此关键作用的世界里，符文管理员可能被认为是祖先的巫师。",
	"In the D&D multiverse, runekeepers are the individuals that passed down the understandings of the interworkings of these universes.": "在D&D多元宇宙中，符文守护者是传承对这些宇宙的相互作用的理解的人。",
	"In the Forgotten Realms, runekeepers have been called \"runecasters\" and \"rune scribes\", and the Rune Knights introduced in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything were given a taste of the keeper's power. The knowledge of rune magic was a treasure given to Annam All-Father, the chief giant deity and creator of the giant race, from the modrons. The runes of giants played a central role during the events of Storm King's Thunder, and many of the languages of the Forgotten Realms were formed from ancient runic dialects.": "在《被遗忘的领域》中，符文守护者被称为 \"符文师 \"和 \"符文抄写员\"，塔莎的《万物熔炉》中介绍的符文骑士就尝到了守护者的厉害。符文魔法的知识是莫德隆人送给安南全能之父的宝物，安南全能之父是巨人族的首席神灵和创造者。巨人的符文在《风暴之王的雷霆》事件中发挥了核心作用，而被遗忘之域的许多语言都是由古代符文方言形成的。",
	"When building your own world, runes are a great means of evoking themes of ancient, occult cultures and can inject your story with arcane mystery. If you're the kind of dungeon master that loves creating your own languages, you can create your own runes for your runekeeper players using the guide in this supplement.": "在构建你自己的世界时，符文是唤起古代神秘文化主题的重要手段，可以为你的故事注入神秘的色彩。如果你是那种喜欢创造自己语言的地下城主，你可以使用本补充文件中的指南为你的符文守卫者玩家创造自己的符文。",
	"As you make your runekeeper character, contemplate the questions you have about the universe(s) in which you occupy. Is there some anomaly that leaves you waking at night? What is the meaning of life?": "当你塑造你的符文看守人角色时，思考你对你所处的宇宙的问题。是否有一些反常现象让你在夜里惊醒？生命的意义是什么？",
	"You can make a runekeeper quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the acolyte background. Lastly, choose two runes that you meet the prerequisites for that can enhance your armor or weapons, or that grant you a cantrip and spells.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名符文守护者。首先，智力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质或灵巧。其次，选择圣职者背景。最后，选择两个符合先决条件的符文，这些符文可以增强你的盔甲或武器，或者赋予你一个咒语和法术。",
	"You gain the ability to inscribe and invoke {@filter magical runes|optionalfeatures|feature type=R}.": "你获得铭文和召唤的能力（%0%）。",
	"At 1st level, you have a lexicon of runes which are fixed in your mind, and contains four {@filter runes of your choice|optionalfeatures|feature type=R}.": "在1级时，你拥有一个固定在你脑海中的符文词典，并包含四个（%0%）。",
	"Each time you gain a runekeeper level, you can add one rune of your choice to your lexicon. You must know how to read, speak, and write the rune's language and must be able to inscribe it to add it. On your adventures, you might find other runes that you can add to your lexicon (such as if a rune gives a magic item its properties or if it is etched into a wall). Adding it requires time spent in contemplation of the rune's truths, requiring 8 hours, which can be completed as a part of a long rest.": "每当你获得一个符文师等级，你就可以将你选择的一个符文加入你的词典。你必须知道如何读、说、写符文的语言，并且必须能够刻写它来添加它。在你的冒险中，你可能会发现其他的符文，你可以将其添加到你的词典中（例如，如果一个符文赋予一个魔法物品以属性，或者如果它被刻在墙上）。添加它需要花费时间来思考符文的真理，需要8个小时，可以作为长时间休息的一部分来完成。",
	"While you might permanently carve or paint a rune onto an object, it's the magical, meditative process of inscription that awakens its potential and makes it available for you to invoke. The rune can be inscribed onto any object, unless a specific object or type of object is detailed in its prerequisites.": "虽然你可能会把符文永久地刻在或画在一个物体上，但正是这种神奇的、冥想式的铭文过程唤醒了它的潜能，使它可以被你调用。符文可以被刻在任何物体上，除非特定的物体或物体类型在其先决条件中被详细说明。",
	"Your inscribed rune remains on the object indefinitely, but when you die, the rune vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The rune also vanishes if you somehow remove it from your runic lexicon.": "你刻下的符文会无限期地保留在物体上，但当你死亡时，符文会在相当于你智力修饰的天数后消失（最少1天）。如果你以某种方式将其从你的符文词典中删除，该符文也会消失。",
	"You can change which runes you have inscribed when you finish a long rest; the maximum number of runes you can inscribe at a time appears in the Inscribed Runes column of the Runekeeper table. An object can only bear one of your inscribed runes at a time. If you inscribe a rune that would exceed your limit of Inscribed Runes, you choose one to dismiss.": "你可以在完成长期休息时改变你所刻画的符文；你一次可以刻画的最大符文数量出现在符文看守人表格的已刻画符文栏中。一个物体每次只能带有你所刻的一个符文。如果你铭刻的符文超过了你所铭刻符文的上限，你就选择一个符文来解除。",
	"Once a rune is inscribed, it provides a passive effect and can be invoked.": "一旦一个符文被刻上，它就会提供一个被动效果，并可以被调用。",
	"While other creatures can attune to and benefit from your inscribed runes, only you can invoke them. Invoking a rune calls for the action specified in its description and lasts for its duration. You must be able to either touch the rune or speak its name to invoke it, and anything that would prevent you from casting a spell also prevents you from invoking a rune. For example, if you or one of your runes were within an area of antimagic, you could not invoke the rune. If multiple objects bear the same rune you have inscribed, you choose which of those runes you invoke.": "虽然其他生物可以适应并受益于你刻下的符文，但只有你可以调用它们。召唤一个符文需要在其描述中指定的行动，并持续其持续时间。你必须能够触摸到符文或说出它的名字才能召唤它，任何会阻止你施法的东西也会阻止你召唤符文。例如，如果你或你的一个符文在一个反魔法的区域内，你就不能调用该符文。如果多个物体带有你所刻的同一个符文，你可以选择调用其中哪个符文。",
	"When you invoke a rune, it becomes inert until you inscribe it again. Inert runes cannot be invoked, but still provide their passive effect.": "当你调用一个符文时，它就会变成惰性的，直到你再次刻上它。惰性符文不能被调用，但仍然提供其被动效果。",
	"As a philosopher of runic truths, Intelligence is the ability you use if a rune requires a saving throw or calls for an attack roll.": "作为一个符文真理的哲学家，如果一个符文需要蓄力或要求攻击卷，智力是你使用的能力。",
	"Your studies of runes supernaturally develops your linguistic capabilities and granting you the eyes of the runekeepers. You can read all writing.": "你对符文的研究超自然地发展了你的语言能力，并赋予你符文管理员的眼睛。你可以阅读所有的文字。",
	"Further, when you finish a long rest, you can replace any Standard or Exotic language you know with another Standard or Exotic language (see: Player's Handbook p. 123). You cannot replace Common with this feature.": "此外，当你完成长期休息时，你可以用另一种标准或异国语言替换你所知道的任何标准或异国语言（见：《玩家手册》第123页）。你不能用这个功能替换普通话。",
	"Runekeepers adopt a form of discussion and logic towards their philosophies, their Keeper's Dialect. These dialects shape one's understanding and ability to manipulate reality. You make that choice now, which grants you features at 2nd level, then again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.": "符文守护者对他们的哲学采取一种讨论和逻辑的形式，即他们的守护者方言。这些方言塑造了一个人的理解和操纵现实的能力。你现在做出了这个选择，它在2级时授予你特性，然后在6级、10级和14级时再次授予。",
	"You have learned to channel the latent potential of your runes through the artistry of rune stance. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose to enter a rune stance. If you do, that stance's effects apply in a 10-foot radius area around you. The effects last until you switch to another stance or are knocked {@condition unconscious}. You can choose between the following stances:": "你已经学会通过符文姿态的艺术性来引导你的符文的潜在潜力。作为你回合中的额外行动，你可以选择进入一个符文姿态。如果你这样做了，该姿态的效果会在你周围10英尺的范围内生效。这些效果一直持续到你切换到另一个姿态或被击倒（%0%）。你可以选择以下几种姿态。",

	"You can open your mind to resonance of creation, allowing you to sense magic energy around you. You do so as an action, which places you under the effects of the {@spell detect magic} spell as long as you maintain concentration on it.": "你可以打开你的心智与创造的共鸣，使你能够感应到你周围的魔法能量。你这样做是一个动作，只要你保持对它的专注，就会使你处于{@spell detect magic}的法术效果之下。",
	"Further, when you are aware of magic's presence on an object or surface, you can freely interact with it without causing any spell or magical effect to trigger.": "此外，当你意识到魔法在物体或表面的存在时，你可以自由地与它互动，而不会导致任何咒语或魔法效果的触发。",

	"If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a {@5etools feat|feats.html}.": "如果你的DM允许使用功法，你可以改用（%0%）。",
	"By tapping into the essence of creation, you gain the ability to invoke one of your inert runes by using runic charges. You gain a number of these charges equal to half your runekeeper level, rounded down.": "通过挖掘创造的本质，你获得了通过使用符文收费来调用你的一个惰性符文的能力。你获得的符文数量相当于你的符文师等级的一半，向下取整。",
	"You can choose one of your inert runes and invoke it again by spending runic charges. Unless otherwise stated in its invoked effect, an inert rune only requires 1 runic charge to invoke.": "你可以选择你的一个惰性符文，通过花费符文费用再次调用它。除非在调用效果中另有说明，一个惰性符文只需要1个符文费用来调用。",
	"You regain all of your spent runic charges when you finish a long rest.": "当你完成长期休息时，你会恢复所有已用的符文费用。",
	"At 6th level, you gain one feature granted by your Keeper's Dialect.": "在6级时，你获得一个由你的守护者方言赋予的特性。",
