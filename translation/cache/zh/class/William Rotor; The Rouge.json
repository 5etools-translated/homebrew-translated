	"Casting spells using your make-up kit as a spell focus may look different to how spells are usually cast in the game. The following are clarifications and examples of this.": "使用你的化妆包作为施法焦点的施法方式可能与游戏中通常的施法方式不同。以下是这方面的澄清和例子。",
	"You apply the makeup to your own face. For example, for {@spell disguise self}, you paint a semblance of a disguise on your face, at which point the magic effects take over and complete the disguise.": "你把化妆品涂在自己的脸上。例如，对于{@spell disguise self}，你在自己的脸上画出一个伪装的模样，这时魔法效果就会接手，完成伪装。",
	"You apply the makeup to your ally. For example, {@spell cure wounds} may involve painting fresh healed skin over the wound.": "你给你的盟友上妆。例如，{@spell cure wounds}可能涉及在伤口上涂抹新鲜的愈合皮肤。",
	"You apply the makeup to yourself and the magic spreads to nearby allies. For example, you paint winged eyeshadow as part of {@spell feather fall}, and when the magic kicks in, it affects allies of your choice as it would under any other circumstance. You apply the makeup to yourself even if you aren't one of the targets of the spell.": "你给自己化妆，魔法会扩散到附近的盟友。例如，你在{@spell feather fall}的范围内画上翼状眼影，当魔法生效时，它会影响到你选择的盟友，就像在其他情况下一样。即使你不是法术的目标之一，你也会给自己上妆。",
	"You slop a loose coat of make-up over your enemy when you touch them. For example, {@spell bestow curse} may require you to paint a cursed sigil on the palm of your hand and slap the wet paint onto a flat surface on their armor.": "当你接触你的敌人时，你会在他们身上涂抹一层松散的化妆品。例如，{@spell bestow curse}可能需要你在手掌上画一个被诅咒的符号，然后把湿的颜料拍到他们盔甲的平面上。",
	"You apply makeup to your own face and the enemy looks on in horror. For example, you paint a terrifying monstrous visage to cast fear. Some spells don't require the enemy to see you, in which case the makeup merely imbues you with the power to cast the spell.": "你在自己的脸上化妆，而敌人在一旁惊恐地看着。例如，你画一个可怕的怪物面孔来施放恐惧。有些法术并不要求敌人看到你，在这种情况下，化妆只是赋予你施法的力量。",
	"You apply the makeup to your own face and then make the attack roll as the magic kicks in. For example, you paint your face an angelic shade of white for {@spell guiding bolt}, filling you with heroic energy that is released when you point at your target.": "你把化妆品涂在自己的脸上，然后在魔法生效时进行攻击卷。例如，你将自己的脸涂成天使般的白色，持续时间为（%0%），使你充满英雄般的能量，当你指向你的目标时就会释放出来。",
	"You apply the makeup to your own face, and the magic emanates out into the world from there. For example, the makeup applied as part of {@spell silent image} might slide off of your face and reform into the illusion the spell creates, or, while casting {@spell prestidigitation}, the gestures required for your makeup like flicking your wrist or pinching your nose can be replicated in the world as a candle sputtering to life or an odor disappearing.": "你把化妆品涂在自己的脸上，魔法从那里发散到世界。例如，作为{@spell silent image}的一部分所化的妆容可能会从你的脸上滑落，重新变成咒语所创造的幻象，或者，在施展{@spell prestidigitation}时，你化妆所需的手势，如弹动你的手腕或捏住你的鼻子，可以在世界中复制成蜡烛的喷发或气味的消失。",
	"You apply the makeup to your own face and cast the spell as normal.": "你把化妆品涂在自己的脸上，像平常一样施法。",
	"There are several key considerations to take into account if you wish to incorporate the rouge class into your game while keeping true to its original intentions.": "如果你想将胭脂虫类纳入你的游戏，同时保持其原始意图，有几个关键的考虑因素需要考虑。",
	"You can choose to flavour how your makeup is incorporated into your spells as you wish; the more creative your application, the better.": "你可以根据自己的意愿选择将妆容融入你的法术的方式，你的应用越有创意，就越好。",
	"You can apply make-up during short or long rests.": "你可以在短时间或长时间的休息中进行化妆。",
	"If necessary, yo ucan use the same hand to apply make-up and to perform somatic components unless your DM decides otherwise.": "如果有必要，你可以用同一只手来化妆和执行身体部分，除非你的医生另有决定。",
	"While you are perfectly capable of applying makeup to others (and many of your spells involve doing so), your favoured face effects apply only to you. Only you can benefit from your face.": "虽然你完全有能力为他人化妆（而且你的许多法术都涉及这样做），但你喜欢的面部效果只适用于你。只有你能从你的脸部受益。",
	"Applying new makeup as part of a spell or class feature does not remove your favoured face. Only painting a new favoured face or explicitly removing your makeup cancels these abilities.": "作为法术或阶级特征的一部分，涂抹新的妆容并不会移除你所喜爱的脸。只有画一张新的喜爱的脸或明确地卸下你的妆容才会取消这些能力。",
	"Spells like {@spell vampiric touch} and your poison ivy favoured face option provide you with a reliable (if low) source of damage, but expecting to match a sorcerer twinning {@spell disintegrate} is misconstructing the intention of the rouge class, which is meant to be a social/utility controller. It is okay to rely on your teammates for damage when you excel in other areas.": "像{@spell vampiric touch}这样的法术和你的毒藤宠脸选项为你提供了可靠的（如果低的话）伤害来源，但期望与巫师结对{@spell disintegrate}是对胭脂类的意图的误解，它的目的是成为一个社交/实用的控制器。当你在其他方面表现出色时，依靠你的队友提供伤害是可以的。",
	"Many of your class features only function while you are wearing makeup. Your DM may rule that certain situations, like taking a long rest, taking a bath, or being whelmed by a {@creature water weird} remove your makeup. Don't argue with your DM; simply take the next opportunity to spend a minute reapplying it. If you feel your DM is being too punishing, explain out of character that you are assumed to have these options always available to you, and removing your makeup is like taking away a fighter's weapons and armor. It's not that it can't be done, it's that overdoing it is potentially against the spirit of the game.": "你的许多类别特征只有在你化妆的时候才能发挥作用。你的管理员可能会规定在某些情况下，比如长时间休息、洗澡或被一个{@creature water weird}的人拖累时，要卸掉你的妆。不要与你的DM争论；只要抓住下一个机会，花一分钟时间重新涂抹。如果你觉得你的管理员太过严厉，可以用你的性格来解释，你被认为总是有这些选择，而卸妆就像拿走一个战士的武器和盔甲。这并不是说不能这样做，而是说过度的做法有可能违背游戏的精神。",
	"Most importantly, just like with bards and enchanters, your offensive abilities are best used against NPCs (and with full cooperation from your DM). Always obey the social contract of your table and consider your friends from the perspective of flesh and blood players before characters. If someone is uncomfortable with you casting {@spell charm person} on their character, for example, the correct course of action is to stop and reestablish boundaries. You are winning the game when the whole table has fun, not just you.": "最重要的是，就像吟游诗人和魔法师一样，你的进攻能力最好是用来对付NPC（并得到你的DM的充分合作）。始终遵守你桌子上的社会契约，从有血有肉的玩家的角度考虑你的朋友，而不是角色。例如，如果有人对你在他的角色上施放（%0%）感到不舒服，正确的做法是停下来，重新建立界限。当整张桌子都有乐趣时，你就是在赢得游戏，而不仅仅是你。",
	"Starting at 1st level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that involves the use of your {@item disguise kit|phb}, your {@item painter's supplies|phb}, or your make-up kit.": "从1级开始，对于任何涉及使用你的（%0%）、你的（%1%）或你的化妆包的能力检查，你的熟练度加成会加倍。",
	"Your ability to channel magic through the application of make-up is an uncommon source of power in the world, replicating effects from both the study of the arcane and the divine. When you cast spells, the somatic and material components of the spell are replaced with the act of applying make-up to you or your target. See {@book chapter 10|PHB|10} for the general rules of spellcasting.": "你通过化妆来引导魔法的能力是世界上不常见的力量来源，它可以复制来自奥术和神学研究的效果。当你施展法术时，法术的体质和物质成分被替换为对你或你的目标进行化妆的行为。关于施法的一般规则，请参见（%0%）。",
	"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the {@filter rouge spell list|spells|class=Rouge (WRTR)}. You learn additional rouge cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the rouge table.": "一级时，你会从（%0%）中选择三个咒语。在更高等级时，你会学习更多你选择的胭脂虫咒语，如胭脂虫表的已知咒语栏所示。",
	"The rouge table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.": "胭脂表显示了你有多少个法术槽来施展你的一级及以上的法术。要施展其中一个法术，你必须消耗一个该法术等级或更高的法术槽。当你完成长时间的休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。",
	"You prepare the list of rouge spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the {@filter rouge spell list|spells|class=Rouge (WRTR)}. When you do so, choose a number of rouge spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your rouge level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.": "你准备好可供你施展的胭脂法术清单，从（%0%）中选择。当你这样做时，选择与你的魅力修改器+你的胭脂水粉等级相等数量的胭脂水粉法术（最少一个法术）。这些法术的等级必须是你有法术槽的。",
	"For example, if you are a 3rd-level rouge, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell cure wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一个三级的胭脂虫，你有四个一级和两个二级的法术槽。在魅力值为16的情况下，你准备的法术清单可以包括6个1级或2级的法术，以任何方式组合。如果你准备了1级法术（%0%），你可以用1级或2级法术槽来施放它。施放该法术并不会从你的准备好的法术列表中移除它。",
	"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of rouge spells requires time spent arranging your make-up kit in the correct configuration: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.": "你可以在完成长时间的休息后改变你准备的法术清单。准备一份新的胭脂水粉法术清单需要花时间将你的化妆包安排成正确的配置：清单上的每个法术等级至少需要1分钟。",
	"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your rouge spells. The power of your spells comes from your technical ability with your make-up supplies. You use your Charisma whenever a rouge spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a rouge spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "魅力是你施展胭脂水粉法术的能力。你的法术的力量来自于你对化妆用品的技术能力。每当胭脂水粉的咒语提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的魅力。此外，在为你施展的胭脂水粉法术设定蓄力DC时，以及在用胭脂水粉法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的魅力修改器。",
	"You use your make-up kit as a spellcasting focus for your rouge spells, which can also replace somatic components. Without your make-up kit, you cannot cast spells of 1st level or higher, but you can still cast cantrips.": "你用你的化妆包作为你的胭脂水粉法术的施法焦点，它也可以代替体质成分。没有化妆包，你不能施展1级以上的法术，但你仍然可以施展咒语。",
	"When you cast a spell that has material components with a gold cost, you can replace the components of that spell with your make-up, but you require specialised, expensive make-up to do so. The specialised make-up you need costs the same amount as the materials components would have cost.": "当你施放一个具有金币成本的材料成分的法术时，你可以用你的化妆来替换该法术的成分，但你需要专门的、昂贵的化妆来这样做。你所需要的专业化妆的费用与材料组件的费用相同。",
	"At 2nd level, choose one rouge specialisation: Clown, Effects Master, Fashionista, Goth, or Pretty Face. Each specialisation is a different mode of application for your make-up skills.": "在第2级时，选择一种胭脂虫的专长。小丑，特效大师，时尚达人，哥特，或漂亮脸蛋。每个专业都是你化妆技能的一个不同的应用模式。",
	"Each rouge specialisation has a list of spells—its specialisation spells—that you gain when you can cast spellsof the level listed in the description. Once you gain a specialisation spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepareeach day.": "每个胭脂匠的专长都有一个法术列表--它的专长法术--当你可以施展描述中所列的法术等级时，你就会获得这些法术。一旦你获得了一个专长法术，你就会一直准备好它，而且它不计入你每天可以准备的法术数量。",
	"If you have a specialisation spell that doesn't appear on the rouge spell list, the spell is nonetheless a rouge spell for you.": "如果你有一个专门的法术没有出现在胭脂水粉法术列表中，那么这个法术对你来说还是一个胭脂水粉法术。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, you can choose a favoured face from the following list. The effects apply only as long as your make-up remains on your face, and these are not considered to be magical effects (for example, they cannot be dispelled). Using a mirror, you can change your favoured face by taking ten uninterrupted minutes to apply new make-up.": "从3级开始，你可以从以下列表中选择一个喜欢的脸。这些效果只在你的妆容停留在脸上的时候适用，而且这些效果不被认为是魔法效果（例如，它们不能被驱散）。使用一面镜子，你可以通过不间断地花10分钟时间涂抹新的化妆品来改变你喜欢的脸。",
	"Your rouge specialisation gives you an additional favoured face option.": "你的 \"胭脂 \"专长给了你一个额外的受宠面孔选择。",
	"Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to fabricate mirrors from any substance. Choose a 1 foot by 1 foot block of loose materials that you can see within range that are stone, sand, or another mineral substance. You create a circular mirror that has a diameter of no more than 1 foot. This mirror can include a handle. Creatures or magic items are unaffected by this ability.": "同样在3级，你获得了用任何物质制造镜子的能力。选择一块1英尺乘1英尺的松散材料，在你能看到的范围内，是石头、沙子或其他矿物物质。你制造一个直径不超过1英尺的圆镜。这面镜子可以包括一个把手。生物或魔法物品不受这个能力的影响。",
	"When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.": "当你达到四级时，你可以将你选择的一项能力得分提高2分，或者将你选择的两项能力得分提高1分。",
	"If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a {@5etools feat|feats.html}.": "如果你的DM允许使用特技，你可以改用{@5etools feat|feats.html}。",
	"Starting at 5th level, you can replenish your source of magic by taking 10 minutes to paint a rune into your skin using your make-up kit. You can smear away this rune as a bonus action to regain a 1st-level spell slot. Once you have replenished a spell slot using this feature, you can't repaint the rune on your body until you have completed a short or long rest.": "从5级开始，你可以用10分钟的时间用你的化妆工具在你的皮肤上画一个符文来补充你的魔法来源。你可以把这个符文作为一个额外动作涂抹掉，重新获得一个一级法术槽。一旦你用这个功能补充了一个法术槽，你就不能在身上重新涂抹符文，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"At 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Rouge Specialisation.": "在6级时，你获得了一个由你的红色专业所赋予的功能。",
	"When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.": "当你达到8级时，你可以将你选择的一项能力得分提高2分，或者将你选择的两项能力得分提高1分。",
	"At 9th level, you gain the knowledge to paint a second rune into your skin. This second rune functions the same as the first, but can be used to replenish a 1st- or 2nd-level spell slot.": "9级时，你获得了在皮肤上绘制第二个符文的知识。这第二个符文的功能与第一个相同，但可以用来补充一个一级或二级的法术槽。",
	"Starting at 10th level, your make-up ability becomes uncanny. After studying a humanoid face for at least 10 minutes, you can take another 10 minutes to perfectly replicate that face onto your own. In addition to changing your face, your magic also changes your voice to match, and can also make you shorter or taller by up to 1 foot. The effects last until the make-up is removed.": "从10级开始，你的化妆能力变得不可思议。在研究一张人脸至少10分钟后，你可以再花10分钟将那张脸完美地复制到自己身上。除了改变你的脸之外，你的魔法还能改变你的声音，使之与之匹配，还能使你变矮或变高，最多达到1英尺。这些效果一直持续到卸妆为止。",
	"A suspicious creature can make a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) ability check to examine you, rolling against your spell save DC to identify you as an imposter. The creature has advantage on this check if they have a close relationship with this person.": "一个可疑的生物可以用智慧（（%0%））检查你的能力，用你的法术救赎DC来确定你是个冒牌货。如果该生物与此人有密切的关系，则在这个检查中具有优势。",

	"At 13th level, you gain a feature granted by your Rouge Specialisation.": "在13级时，你获得了一个由你的红色专业所赋予的功能。",
	"Starting at 14th level, when you are under the effects of aspell or other magical effect, you can take an action to repaint your face, changing your expression in the process. If you do so, the next saving throw you make to end the spell or effectis made with advantage. This doesn't end any effects that rely on wearing make-up. It also changes your mood from optimistic to pessimistic, or vice versa.": "从14级开始，当你受到咒语或其他魔法效果的影响时，你可以采取一个行动来重新涂抹你的脸，在这个过程中改变你的表情。如果你这样做了，你为结束咒语或效果所做的下一次蓄力就会有优势。这并不能结束任何依赖化妆的效果。它还可以将你的情绪从乐观变为悲观，反之亦然。",
	"At 15th level, you gain the knowledge to paint a third rune into your skin. This third rune functions the same as the first and second, but can be used to replish a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell slot.": "15级时，你获得了在皮肤上绘制第三个符文的知识。这第三个符文的功能与第一个和第二个相同，但可以用来补充一个一级、二级或三级的法术槽。",

	"At 18th level, you have grown so adept at painting your face that much of your magical ability comes without conscious thought. You don't need to spend spell slots to cast 1st-level spells from your list of specialisation spells. To cast the spell at a higher level, you must spend the appropriate spell slot. For example, a clown can cast {@spell color spray} at will, or it can spend a 2nd-level slot to cast {@spell color spray} at a higher level.": "在18级的时候，你已经非常善于画你的脸，以至于你的大部分魔法能力都是在无意识的情况下产生的。你不需要花费法术槽来施展你的专业法术列表中的一级法术。要想施展更高层次的法术，你必须花费相应的法术槽。例如，一个小丑可以随意施放（%0%），也可以花一个2级法术槽来施放更高等级的（%1%）。",

	"The clown is an entertainer, but equally they are a figure of horror, drawing upon the ghostly pallour of the dead, the bright red lips of a poisonous beetle, the sunken eyes of a bloated corpse, the wild hair of a thorny brush, and the gangly movements of a puppet without a master.": "小丑是一个艺人，但同样他们也是一个恐怖的形象，他们借鉴了死者的幽灵般的苍白，毒甲虫的鲜红嘴唇，臃肿的尸体的凹陷的眼睛，带刺的毛发，以及一个没有主人的木偶的痞子动作。",

	"At 3rd level, this option becomes available to you.": "在第三级时，这个选项对你来说是可用的。",
	"When a creature hits you with a melee attack, your blank eyes and false smile is deeply unsettling to them.

A creature that succeeds on this save is immune to this effect for 24 hours.": "当一个生物用近战攻击击中你时，你那空洞的眼神和虚假的微笑让他们深感不安。作为反应，你迫使该生物对你的法术救赎DC进行智慧救赎，在救赎失败的情况下，成为你的（%0%），直到你下一回合结束。拯救成功的生物会在24小时内对这个效果免疫。",

	"Starting at 20th level, when a creature that fails a save against one of your spells of 1st-level or higher, you can force the creature to become maddened by its experience in addition to the effects of the spell. The madness lasts for {@dice 1d10} minutes. Once a creature has been maddened by this effect, it can't be maddened in the same way for 24 hours.
