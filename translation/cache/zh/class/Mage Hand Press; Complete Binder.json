	"When he finally spoke, it was with the voices of several beings at once, overlapping in an unnatural harmony. But the most prominent voice was gruff and confident, which he used to lull his targets into complacency seconds before he struck with a hidden dagger. By the next morning, the gruff, independent voice was gone, instead replaced with a profound melancholy. He discarded the daggers too, in favor of a sturdy spear and imposing armor. The day after that, he struck an air of erratic rage, and he abandoned weapons altogether in favor of eldritch flame. Each morning, he woke up new, possessed by some new infernal spirit, dead god, or forgotten sinner.": "当他终于开口说话时，是用几个人的声音同时说话，以一种不自然的和谐方式重叠在一起。但最突出的声音是粗暴和自信的，在他用隐藏的匕首攻击前几秒钟，他用这种声音来哄骗他的目标，使其自满。到了第二天早上，那个粗暴、独立的声音已经消失了，取而代之的是一种深刻的忧郁。他也丢弃了匕首，改用坚固的长矛和气派的盔甲。之后的一天，他打出了一种反复无常的愤怒的气息，他完全放弃了武器，转而使用长生火。每天早晨，他都会醒来，被一些新的地狱之魂、死去的神或被遗忘的罪人所占有。",
	"Binders are students of soul magic, an ancient and forbidden art that allows them to call to entities that live beyond the known planes, in the spaces between the worlds, drawing them into their own souls to steal their power—though not always without a price.": "装订者是灵魂魔法的学生，这是一种古老而禁忌的艺术，使他们能够召唤生活在已知世界之外的实体，在世界之间的空间，将它们吸引到自己的灵魂中，窃取它们的力量--尽管并非总是没有代价。",
	"Binders learn to cast their minds into the Void between planes, to search the abyss there for beings that will answer their call. These beings—called {@filter vestiges|optionalfeatures|source=MageHandPressCompleteBinder|feature type=VST}—are remnants of powerful spirits residing in the nothingness outside of reality, which is born from the last echoes of the world's creation, and from energies that leak out of the planes.": "捆绑者学会将他们的思想投射到位面之间的虚空中，在那里的深渊中搜寻会回应他们召唤的生命。这些被称为（%0%）的生命是居住在现实之外的虚无中的强大精神的残余，它是由世界创造的最后的回声和从各平面泄漏出来的能量所产生的。",
	"Vestiges are born of dead gods and tragic heroes, but their forms, personalities, and motivations are shaped by the whims of remembrance. Righteous spirits that are remembered as villains develop a fiendish aspect and sinister overtones, while those who are forgotten fade over millennia into the Void's static. Mercifully, binder scholars record and preserve the original, often apocryphal, tales of these vestiges' origins, allowing them to persist longer in the Void.": "遗迹是由死去的神和悲惨的英雄诞生的，但他们的形式、个性和动机是由纪念的奇思妙想塑造的。正义的灵魂如果被当作恶棍来记忆，就会发展出邪恶的一面和阴险的色彩，而那些被遗忘的人则会在几千年后消逝在虚空的静态中。令人欣慰的是，装订机学者们记录并保存了这些残余物起源的原始故事，这些故事往往是天方夜谭，让它们在虚空中持续更久。",
	"Because vestiges are devoid of all sensation in the Void, they crave any small taste of reality, and will answer the call of any binder powerful enough to draw them forth. Binders can merge a portion of their soul with a vestige in exchange for some of the power the vestige commanded in life.": "因为遗迹在虚空中没有任何感觉，他们渴望任何现实的小滋味，并且会响应任何足够强大的捆绑者的召唤，把他们拉出来。捆绑者可以将自己的一部分灵魂与遗迹融合，以换取遗迹生前所拥有的一些力量。",
	"In order to harbor a vestige, a binder must divide their very soul and offer part of it to the vestige for residence. Sharing their soul in this way leaves profound marks as the vestige pushes its way into reality: it influences its binder's personality and usually warps their body in accordance with the vestige's esoteric form. Last, but not least, the soul itself is permanently fractured, which could have unforeseen consequences in the afterlife. It is for this reason that binding magic is usually forbidden.": "为了包庇一个遗迹，捆绑者必须将自己的灵魂分割开来，并将其中的一部分提供给遗迹居住。以这种方式分享自己的灵魂，在遗迹进入现实时留下了深刻的印记：它影响了捆绑者的个性，通常会根据遗迹的深奥形式扭曲他们的身体。最后，但并非最不重要的是，灵魂本身会被永久分裂，这可能会在来世产生不可预知的后果。正是由于这个原因，束缚魔法通常是被禁止的。",
	"Skilled binders learn to break their soul into smaller and smaller pieces to bind greater and more numerous spirits. At their pinnacle, a binder can wield magic of ancient, forgotten gods while swinging the blades of legendary heroes, but their voice becomes quiet among the clamor of disparate spirits and their soul is relegated to but a fraction of their persona.": "熟练的捆绑者学会将自己的灵魂分成越来越小的碎片，以捆绑更大更多的灵魂。在他们的巅峰时期，捆绑者可以挥舞古老的、被遗忘的神的魔法，同时挥舞传奇英雄的刀剑，但他们的声音在不同的精神的喧嚣中变得安静，他们的灵魂只剩下他们角色的一小部分。",
	"As you make your binder character, spend some time thinking about your relationship to your vestiges, and the extent to which you allow them to influence your personality. How did you learn about the mysterious vestiges, and do you have a special relationship to any of them? What drew you to your first summoning? How do you view your own soul, given that you allow other spirits to take up residence within it?": "在你塑造你的活页夹角色时，花一些时间思考你与你的遗迹的关系，以及你允许它们影响你的个性的程度。你是如何了解到这些神秘的遗迹的，你和它们中的任何一个有特殊关系吗？是什么吸引了你的第一次召唤？鉴于你允许其他灵体在你的灵魂中居住，你如何看待自己的灵魂？",
	"Work with your GM to determine what role vestiges and other binders will play in your campaign.": "与你的总经理合作，确定遗迹和其他活页夹在你的活动中会发挥什么作用。",
	"As a binder, you can redefine your role in the adventuring party; daily, if desired. There is also the possibility that your appearance and your very personality will flex with different vestiges holding sway over your soul. How do you and your adventuring party confront this, and how do you handle the physical traits presented by your vestiges? Do you hide these signs, for fear of public retribution, or do you flaunt them, embracing the power that they offer you?": "作为一个装订者，你可以重新定义你在冒险党中的角色；如果需要，每天都可以。还有一种可能性是，你的外表和你的个性会随着不同的遗迹对你的灵魂的支配而发生弯曲。你和你的冒险队伍如何面对这一点，你如何处理你的遗迹所呈现的身体特征？你是隐藏这些迹象，因为害怕公众的报复，还是炫耀它们，拥抱它们提供给你的力量？",
	"To make a binder quickly, consider the following suggestions: make Charisma your highest stat, followed by a medium balance of Constitution, Strength, and Dexterity. Because you can take any party role, you should be prepared to change your hat on a moment's notice. Lastly, choose any background.": "为了快速制作一个活页夹，请考虑以下建议：让魅力成为你的最高属性，其次是体质、力量和灵巧的中等平衡。因为你可以担任任何一方的角色，所以你应该准备好在一瞬间改变你的帽子。最后，选择任何背景。",

	"You can spend 10 minutes conducting a special binding ritual, which entails drawing the signs of vestiges in chalk, calling each by name, and performing other, more esoteric acts. During this ritual, vestiges manifest tangible signs as they press against the boundaries of reality and find purchase within your soul.": "你可以花10分钟进行一个特殊的捆绑仪式，这需要用粉笔画出遗迹的标志，叫出每个遗迹的名字，并进行其他更深奥的行为。在这个仪式中，遗迹表现出有形的迹象，因为它们压迫着现实的边界，并在你的灵魂中找到购买力。",
	"At 1st level, you can bind one vestige, and can bind more vestiges at higher levels, as shown in the Vestiges Bound column of the Binder table. Unless otherwise specified, you can only bind vestiges whose combined level is no greater than your binder level.": "在1级时，你可以绑定一个遗迹，并可以在更高等级时绑定更多的遗迹，如绑定表的遗迹一栏中所示。除非另有规定，你只能绑定综合等级不高于你的绑定等级的遗迹。",

	"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all spells and powers granted to you by your vestiges, since you command the power of your vestiges though your very soul. Use your Charisma score whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell or ability granted to you by one of your vestiges.": "魅力是你的法术能力，适用于所有由你的遗迹赋予你的法术和力量，因为你通过你的灵魂来指挥你的遗迹的力量。每当咒语提到你的法术能力时，就使用你的魅力得分。此外，在设定由你的遗迹赋予你的法术或能力的蓄力值时，使用你的魅力修饰。",

Any effects created by a dismissed vestige immediately end. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "从2级开始，你可以用你的行动来执行一个改良版的束缚仪式，允许你提前驱逐一个被束缚的（%0%），并在其位置上束缚另一个同等或更低等级的遗迹。任何由被驱逐的遗迹产生的效果都会立即结束。一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",

	"All binders call to their vestiges from the howling Void, but only the Avatarists bring them into physical form, outside their very bodies. Doing so is an ancient discipline, harnessing the very magic which conjures fiends from the underworld—as with all the other great secrets of binding, conjuring an avatar is heresy of the highest magnitude. Those that manage this feat may join the ranks of the avatarists, a selective legion of binders who combat others using only manifestations of their spirits. Such combat is a battle of the ego as much as a physical brawl, for a fraction of any injury bestowed upon an avatar is in turn laid on the binder.": "所有的捆绑者都会从咆哮的虚空中召唤他们的残骸，但只有阿凡达主义者才会把他们带入身体的形式，在他们的身体之外。这样做是一门古老的学问，利用从冥界召唤恶魔的魔法--与所有其他伟大的束缚秘密一样，召唤阿凡达是最高等级的异端。那些能够做到这一点的人可以加入化身者的行列，这是一个选择性的捆绑者军团，他们只用自己的精神表现来对抗他人。这种战斗既是一场自我的战斗，也是一场身体上的争斗，因为赋予阿凡达的任何伤害都会反过来作用于捆绑者。",

	"Quite to the contrary of other binders, the Brotherhood of Ascetics believe that self-discipline is the only path to enlightenment. Binding vestiges isn't enough: one must have perfect control of their own soul to truly accept the gifts of wandering spirits. Thus, Ascetics deprive themselves of worldly pleasures and the very power of their bound vestiges in order to assert their will perfectly and achieve transcendental wisdom.": "与其他装订者截然不同的是，修行者兄弟会认为自律是通往开悟的唯一途径。仅仅捆绑遗迹是不够的：一个人必须对自己的灵魂有完美的控制，才能真正接受游魂的礼物。因此，禁欲主义者剥夺了自己的世俗快乐和被束缚的虚影的力量，以便完美地坚持自己的意志，实现超验的智慧。",

Instead, she stumbled upon the existence of vestiges quite by accident when trying her scrying spell malfunctioned. As often happens when this spell fails, Gyx heard a whoosh of static and saw a flash of deep black. But on this occasion, she heard a whisper in the noise. Through experimentation, she refined the spell into a rudimentary binding ritual and communed with the distant spirits of the Void.

In a flowing dress and wide-brimmed hat, she cut a striking figure that was irresistible to intoxicated men and disloyal husbands, who she soon lured away from the firelight and deep into the wilderness. Once far from help, the Devil Woman would reveal her true nature: the face of a rotting corpse, eyes burning like coals in their sockets, and a half-beast body, with one leg possessing a cloven foot.

	"While bound to Tyche, three small sigils (associated with a game of chance you are familiar with) float in front of your forehead. You can extinguish one of these to add 1d8 to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. However, when you extinguish all three, you subtract 2 from all subsequent attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws you make while bound to Tyche.": "当你被Tyche束缚时，你的额头前会浮现三个小符号（与你熟悉的一种机会游戏有关）。你可以熄灭其中一个，在攻击卷、能力测验或蓄力上增加1d8。然而，当你熄灭全部三个时，你在与Tyche结合时的所有后续攻击卷、能力检查和自救动作都会减去2。",

The commoner Tyche lived a good life, an unnaturally long and happy one, content to only use her gift to help those around her.": "然而，众神从未发现运气这个词。即使这些词被编入魔法词典，运气仍然难以捉摸。平民Tyche过着美好的生活，一个不自然的漫长而快乐的生活，只满足于用她的天赋来帮助她周围的人。",
	"When the avatar of Death arrived to claim Tyche and her Luck, she greeted its cold visage cheerfully. She asked of the reaper only that she could spread Luck among those who deserved it, rather than pass it along to the gods. That way, the patient, the bold, the tenacious, and the needy might have their day. Clever as always, Death agreed, stealing a sliver of Luck for itself, such that it might win any game it plays against mortals. Tyche doesn't seem to mind, as her vestige rolls dice with Death often, and has never lost.": "当死神的化身来索取泰切和她的运气时，她愉快地迎接了它冰冷的面孔。她对收割者的要求只是希望她能在那些值得拥有它的人中传播幸运，而不是把它传递给神灵。这样一来，耐心的人、大胆的人、顽强的人和需要帮助的人可能会有他们的一天。死神一如既往地聪明，同意为自己偷取一丝运气，这样它就可以在与凡人的游戏中获胜。泰切似乎并不介意，因为她的遗物经常与死神掷骰子，而且从未输过。",

Picking up the remaining rings, Mr. Joe stepped into the flames and ascended to become Sham, Lord of Trickery.": "就在这时，霍加斯揭开了他宏伟的外表：在他的长袍下是木制的关节和提线木偶；他只是一个精心编造的作品，一个由乔先生熟练控制的木偶，一个Geppettin--一个动画木偶人--一直充当着一个道具。乔先生拿着真正的徽章戒指，而霍加的则是一个假的，和他自己一样令人信服。拿起剩下的戒指，乔先生走进了火焰中，成为骗术之主岑。",

	"These primeval gods believed in order above such petty qualms of good and evil. After all, they carved all of creation from sprawling chaos and struck a mathematical equilibrium—they did not take such balance for granted.

	"Taking up the mantle of \"Runebreaker\", Carthin swore off all magic, save that which might kill the archmagi, and embarked on a journey of vengeance.

In its prime, the Venagoth family was immensely rich and influential, and chose to amass their wealth in their ancestral Vaults, which were practically impregnable, built deep into a mountain, and secured with excessively potent wards. No thief ever successfully infiltrated the Vaults of Venagoth and made it out alive. But one archivist, Döpple, was freely permitted into the Vaults to organize and curate their vast collection.": "当奥术档案馆被烧毁时，它的许多幸存的宝物，包括古代传说的书籍和具有无限力量的魔法物品，被运到数千英里之外的维纳戈斯的地窖，在那里安全地安放了几个世纪。在全盛时期，Venagoth家族拥有巨大的财富和影响力，他们选择在祖先的金库中积累财富，金库建在山的深处，几乎是坚不可摧的，并有极其强大的防护措施。没有一个盗贼能成功潜入Venagoth的金库并活着出来。但有一位档案管理员，多普尔，被自由地允许进入保险库，以组织和管理他们巨大的收藏。",
	"Alas, the record of history is long and unforgiving. With the Venagoth's waning influence came the ire of a barbarian warlord from the north, who campaigned south to burn cities, dethrone kings, and eventually sack the Venagoth estates. Knowing their treasure to be too momentous to lose, the Venagoth patron commanded Döpple to seal himself within the Vaults until the military could drive back the savage horde.": "唉，历史的记录是漫长而无情的。随着维纳哥特人影响力的减弱，来自北方的野蛮人军阀的愤怒也随之而来，他们南下焚烧城市，推翻国王，最终洗劫了维纳哥特人的庄园。由于知道自己的财宝不容有失，维纳哥特的赞助人命令多普尔把自己封在金库里，直到军队能把野蛮的部落赶回去。",
	"But rescue never came. The Archivist lived out his final days, perhaps his final decades, surrounded by the amassed artifacts of millennia. The Vaults of Venagoth were lost to history, but the search for their location always lingers on the entombed Archivist, organizing the collection until his death. Ironically, Döpple's vestige is exceedingly generous where history is not: he is represented by a learned, bespectacled man, standing at the Vaults' door, offering his treasures to those who understand their significance.": "但救援从未到来。档案员度过了他最后的日子，也许是他最后的几十年，被积累了几千年的人工制品所包围。维纳戈斯的金库已经消失在历史中，但对其位置的寻找始终萦绕在被埋葬的档案员身上，他一直在整理这些收藏品，直到他去世。具有讽刺意味的是，多普尔的遗迹在历史不存在的地方极其慷慨：他由一个博学的、面带微笑的人代表，站在金库的门口，将他的宝藏提供给那些了解其意义的人。",

For the gods, in their wisdom, realized that not even they could forge a perfect world on the first try—indeed, countless universes were created and discarded before the gods settled for the current one, with its particular compromises and imperfections.": "在原始诸神奠定宇宙的基础之前，他们设计了一个失败的保险措施，以确保他们的成功，在这个基础上，他们可以雕刻前混沌。在其他一切之前，他们召唤埃里伯斯，一个来自现实面纱之外的解体者，来解开并摧毁他们的创造物。因为众神，以他们的智慧，意识到即使是他们也无法在第一次尝试时就锻造出一个完美的世界--事实上，在众神为目前这个有着特殊妥协和不完美的世界定居之前，无数个宇宙被创造和抛弃。",
	"Erebus was the tool for erasure, made to consume flawed universes and return them to the Chaos so that the gods might try again.": "埃里伯斯是抹杀的工具，被用来吞噬有缺陷的宇宙，并将它们送回混沌，以便诸神可以再次尝试。",
	"Eventually, it seems the primeval gods grew weary of fruitless creation, for then they committed the First Sin: suffering our universe to live through its painful gestation. Cataclysmic disasters swept the world in its infancy, but, perhaps by chance, it persisted and settled into what it is now: petty, brutish, and broken. Our universe's denizens are all sentenced to die from the moment of their births, magic is fleeting and volatile, and the fabric of the universe itself is surely unraveling, imperceptibly and steadily to a pathetic end.": "最终，似乎原始神灵对无果的创造感到厌倦，因为他们犯下了第一宗罪：让我们的宇宙经历痛苦的孕育期。大规模的灾难席卷了这个处于萌芽状态的世界，但是，也许是出于偶然，它坚持了下来，并沉淀为现在的样子：琐碎、野蛮、破碎。我们宇宙的居民都从出生的那一刻起就被宣判了死刑，魔法转瞬即逝，变化无常，而宇宙的结构本身也肯定在解体，不知不觉地稳步走向可悲的结局。",
	"To safeguard their flawed creation, the gods bound Erebus with the Stygian Seal and scatted the Words of Creation. Most speculate that Erebus lies deep within the Void, but history tells a more complex story: in ancient languages, the word Erebus simply means Darkness, and is used both as the name of the entity and the Void itself. This implies either the ancients saw no reason to distinguish between the two, or simply believed they were one and the same. Fittingly, Erebus does not speak to this; her vestige is a howling abyss, upon which all of creation is perched, and from which nothing escapes.": "为了保护他们有缺陷的创造，众神用冥王印将埃里伯斯捆绑起来，并将创造之语散布出去。大多数人猜测埃里伯斯位于虚空深处，但历史告诉我们一个更复杂的故事：在古代语言中，埃里伯斯这个词只是意味着黑暗，并同时作为实体和虚空本身的名称。这意味着要么古人认为没有理由区分这两者，要么只是认为它们是同一种东西。恰当的是，埃里伯斯并没有谈到这一点；她的遗迹是一个咆哮的深渊，所有的创造物都栖息在上面，没有任何东西可以逃出它。",
	"While bound to this vestige, you gain the following flaw: \"I do not speak.\"": "当被这个遗迹束缚时，你会获得以下缺陷：\"我不说话\"。",

Once you cast this spell, Qadir is expelled and is replaced by a {@filter vestige|optionalfeatures|source=MageHandPressCompleteBinder|feature type=VST-L1;VST-L2;VST-L3} of your choice of 3rd level or lower. You can't rebind Qadir until you take a long rest.": "在与卡迪尔结合的时候，你可以施展{@spell wish|PHB}的法术，不需要消耗法术槽或法术组件，就可以复制任何其他8级或以下的{@filter spell|spells|level=0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8}的效果。一旦你施展这个法术，卡迪尔就会被驱逐，并由你选择的一个3级或更低级的（%2%）所取代。在你长时间休息之前，你不能重新绑定卡迪尔。",
	"When you bind to Qadir, your skin tints to a blueish hue, and you constantly float a few inches off the ground on a layer of smoke.

	"An ill-fated genie that abandoned the one who summoned him, Qadir offers his binders a lone wish before abandoning them as well.": "卡迪尔是一个命运多舛的精灵，他抛弃了召唤他的人，在抛弃他们之前为他的装订者提供了一个孤独的愿望。",
	"For centuries, an unremarkable lamp sat untouched, nestled amongst piles of gold in an longforgotten treasure hoard. Then one day, War'Red, the twin brother of legendary thief K'Sir, happened upon the lamp and rubbed its side. Emerging in a swirling cloud of lightning and wind, the noble genie Qadir offered his rescuer three wishes in exchange for his freedom from the lamp.": "几个世纪以来，一盏不起眼的台灯一直无人问津，依偎在一个早已被遗忘的宝藏中的成堆的黄金之中。然后有一天，传奇盗贼K'Sir的孪生兄弟War'Red偶然发现了这盏灯，并摩擦了它的侧面。在一片闪电和风的漩涡中，高贵的精灵卡迪尔出现了，他向救他的人提出了三个愿望，以换取他从神灯中的自由。",
	"First, War'Red wished to become an all-powerful sultan. Qadir agreed, and in a flash, War'Red became a brutal despot of his own kingdom. Then War'Red wished for an army, a million men strong, to spread bloodshed and conquest wherever he turned his gaze. Again, Qadir acquiesced, and legions of foot soldiers sprang into existence around them. Lastly, War'Red wished for immortality, that his reign might be unending. At this, finally, Qadir could comply no longer: he reversed the wishes, banished War'Red to a forsaken desert, and returned to his lamp.": "首先，War'Red希望成为一个无所不能的苏丹。卡迪尔同意了，转眼间，战神成为他自己王国的一个残酷的暴君。然后，\"战争之红 \"希望有一支百万人的军队，在他的目光所及之处传播血腥和征服。卡迪尔再次默许，他们周围的步兵军团纷纷涌现出来。最后，沃雷德希望得到永生，使他的统治永无止境。在这一点上，卡迪尔终于不能再遵从了：他推翻了这些愿望，将War'Red放逐到一个被遗弃的沙漠，并回到了他的灯下。",
	"When K'Sir learned of this, he sought out the lamp and summoned Qadir himself. Again, bound by the magic of the lamp, Qadir offered three wishes to his discoverer, which K'Sir happily accepted: his first wish would be to destroy the genie's mind, his second to destroy his body, and his final wish to destroy his soul. In a whirlwind of deadly magic, Qadir was obliterated. He lives on only as a vestige, a cautionary tale that you should always honor your promises, no matter the cost.": "当K'Sir得知此事后，他找到了神灯并召唤出了卡迪尔本人。卡迪尔再次被神灯的魔力所束缚，向他的发现者提出了三个愿望，K'Sir欣然接受：他的第一个愿望是摧毁精灵的思想，第二个愿望是摧毁他的身体，最后的愿望是摧毁他的灵魂。在一场致命的魔法旋风中，卡迪尔被抹去了。他只作为一个遗迹而存在，是一个警示故事，即无论付出什么代价，你都应该履行你的承诺。",

	"But Palette was clever: she knew that all of dragonkind was magical, from their scales down to their very bones, and so she collected a dragon scale from each type of dragon and ground them into a potion. This elixir contained the very essence of Magic, and upon drinking it, Palette overflowed with energy. Her magic spilled out upon the world in effervescent hues and brilliant pastel. She coated the world with Magic and Color, until all was to her liking.": "但Palette很聪明：她知道所有的龙族都是有魔力的，从它们的鳞片到它们的骨头，所以她从每种龙身上收集了一片龙鳞，并将它们磨成药水。这种药水包含了魔法的精髓，喝下它后，调色板的能量溢出来了。她的魔力在世界范围内溢出来，呈现出泡腾的色调和明亮的粉彩。她给世界涂上了魔法和色彩，直到一切都符合她的心意。",
	"Unlike the dull systematics of Lexicon's magic, Palette's arcana was drawn from emotion and flourished in the face of beauty. Therefore, she is called the First Sorcerer, the wellspring of draconic influence in mortal blood, and ancestral mother of all sorcery.": "与列克西孔魔法的枯燥系统学不同，调色板的奥义来自于情感，在美丽的面前蓬勃发展。因此，她被称为第一巫师，是凡人血液中龙族影响的源泉，是所有巫术的祖先之母。",

In particular, Feng Meng had a lethal instinct for killing monsters, and a knack for striking them in the heart an instant before disaster.": "尽管传说中的弓箭手后羿因为杀死神话中的野兽和击倒九个太阳而被人们记住，但历史往往忘记了他的徒弟，传说中的怪物猎人逢蒙。历史上没有一个弓箭手能真正超越后羿的弓箭技术，但使用新发明的弩箭，逢蒙却险象环生。特别是，冯梦有一种杀死怪物的致命本能，并且善于在灾难发生前的一瞬间击中它们的心脏。",

	"When Hou Yi was awarded an elixir of immortality for his exploits in a hunt, and Feng Meng was given nothing, it became too much. Feng went to confront his mentor, but instead found Hou Yi's wife drinking the elixir herself! When Hou Yi learned of this, he blamed his apprentice for coveting the elixir, and the two came to blows. But whereas Hou Yi was a skilled marksman, Feng Meng was a killer. It took nothing more than a club to beat the legendary archer to death. To hear the story from Feng Meng's vestige, the moral is: don't make friends; it's kill or be killed.": "当后羿在一次狩猎中获得了长生不老药，而逢蒙却什么也没得到时，这让他很不爽。逢蒙去找他的师父，却发现后羿的妻子自己在喝长生不老药。后羿知道后，责怪他的徒弟觊觎灵药，两人发生了冲突。但后羿是一个熟练的射手，而逢蒙是一个杀手。他只用了一根棍子就把这位传奇的弓箭手打死了。从逢蒙的遗迹中听到的故事，其寓意是：不要交朋友；要么杀人，要么被杀。",

	"The spirits of vestiges are faint, distant voices from across the multiverse, which even experienced binders have trouble hearing. Instead of reaching out with occult rituals, arcane circles, and esoteric chants, some binders instead procure reliquaries, physical trinkets with a connection to vestiges. Such items range from scraps of ancient tapestries recording a vestige's life to actual physical scraps of bone from a vestige's bodies.": "遗迹的灵魂是来自多元宇宙的微弱、遥远的声音，即使是经验丰富的装订者也很难听到。一些装订者没有通过神秘的仪式、神秘的圈子和深奥的颂歌来联系，而是采购了一些遗物，与遗迹有联系的实物饰品。这类物品的范围很广，从记录遗迹生活的古代挂毯碎片到遗迹身体的实际骨片。",
