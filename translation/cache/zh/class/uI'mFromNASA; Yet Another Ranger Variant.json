	"A {@creature lion|MM|lion's} roar echoes through the savannah. Birds scatter and startled game dart from the underbrush. Then comes the snapping sound of hidden traps and the dull thud of falling birds, arrows hanging cleanly from their breasts. Then all falls silent and the hunter gathers his prey.": "一声{@creature lion|MM|lion's}的吼声在大草原上回荡。鸟儿们四散奔逃，受惊的动物从灌木丛中飞奔而出。然后是隐藏的陷阱的断裂声和鸟儿坠落的沉闷声，箭头干净地挂在它们的胸前。然后一切归于寂静，猎人收集他的猎物。",
	"Ducking below a {@creature hill giant|MM|hill giant's} clumsy swing, a coastal scout speaks a word of power that sounds like the spray of the surf and disappears, only to emerge again atop the giant's broad shoulders, longsword poised to plunge deep into its neck.": "躲在一个{@creature hill giant|MM|hill giant's}笨拙的挥杆下面，一个沿海的侦察员说了一个听起来像冲浪的水花一样的力量词，然后消失了，只是再次出现在巨人宽阔的肩膀上，长剑准备深深插入它的脖子。",
	"An orc raiding party moves warily through the moonlit forest. The war leader turns to issue a command to his patrol, but finds that he is suddenly, eerily, alone.

	"Each of these characters is a ranger, a diverse class of skilled wilderness survivalists. Rangers do whatever they can to survive in even the harshest of conditions. Whether that entails mastering martial techniques, {@skill medicine}, befriending animals, setting traps, or using practical magic, rangers know what is needed to survive in the harsh worlds they call home.": "这些人物中的每一个都是游侠，这是一个多样化的熟练的野外生存者阶层。游侠们为了在最恶劣的条件下生存，不惜一切代价。无论是掌握武术技巧（%0%）、结交动物、设置陷阱，还是使用实用的魔法，游侠们都知道在他们称之为家园的严酷世界中生存需要什么。",
	"Rangers learn through brutal necessity. They adapt to use terrain to their advantage and learn to fight with whatever styles or weapons they can get their hands on. They master the medicinal properties of plants and the subtle art of befriending wild animals. They learn ranger magic—a practical magic steeped in ritual and born from the divine reverence of nature and the application of arcane techniques and enhancements to whatever tools and materials are available.": "游骑兵在残酷的必要性中学习。他们适应利用地形来发挥自己的优势，并学会使用任何他们能够得到的风格或武器来战斗。他们掌握植物的药用特性和与野生动物交好的微妙艺术。他们学习游侠的魔法--一种沉浸在仪式中的实用魔法，诞生于对自然的神圣敬畏，以及对任何工具和材料的奥秘技术和强化的应用。",
	"Some rangers work in close community with druids to protect sacred groves and hidden valleys. Others live in barbarian communities acting as healers, hunters, or shamans. Some have close ties with civilization, acting as daring explorers or forward scouts for military expeditions. Others are nomadic skirmishers or wilderness guides.": "有些游侠与德鲁伊紧密合作，保护圣林和隐秘的山谷。其他人则生活在野蛮人社区，充当治疗师、猎人或巫师。有些人与文明有密切的联系，充当大胆的探险家或军事远征的前哨侦察员。其他人则是游牧民族的小兵或荒野向导。",
	"No matter what role a ranger plays, a ranger's life is characterized by constant striving against the elements and filled with long stretches of solitude and careful attention broken by hectic moments of bitter struggle.": "无论护林员扮演什么角色，护林员的生活特点是不断地与自然界作斗争，充满了长时间的孤独和细心的关注，并被痛苦的斗争的忙碌时刻打破。",
	"This path is not chosen lightly, but those who do find that a life in the wilderness can be rewarding. Since rangers are often the first to encounter the rampaging beasts and ravenous hordes seeking easy prey in civilized lands, they are also the first to get the chance to defeat them. Rangers find power and purpose on the precipice of disaster.": "这条路不是随便选择的，但那些人发现，在荒野中的生活可以得到回报。由于游骑兵往往是第一个遇到猖獗的野兽和在文明土地上寻找容易的猎物的豺狼群，他们也是第一个有机会击败他们的人。游骑兵在灾难的悬崖边上找到了力量和目标。",
	"As you build a ranger, consider two related elements about your character's background: What brought you into the wilderness, and what allowed you to survive? What tools or techniques did you cling to when all hope seemed lost? Did a mentor teach you your skills or did you have to discover the nuances of the ranger life yourself? What drove you into the lonesome wilderness in the first place? A threat which destroyed your homeland, a wanderlust for the unknown, or a desire to protect your people might all have been factors.": "当你建立一个游侠时，考虑你的角色背景的两个相关因素。是什么让你进入荒野，又是什么让你得以生存？当所有的希望似乎都破灭的时候，你坚持使用了什么工具或技术？是导师教你的技能，还是你必须自己去发现游侠生活的细微差别？首先是什么驱使你进入孤独的荒野？摧毁你的家园的威胁，对未知世界的渴望，或者保护你的人民的愿望，可能都是因素。",
	"Perhaps you fled a boring civilized life to find adventure, only to discover an affinity with the land you would never have discovered had you stayed. Or perhaps you were called upon by your chieftain because of your quick wits and agility, and were groomed for greatness. Perhaps you were raised by wolves and find yourself most at home while surrounded by a pack. What matters is that you learned to use your will and wits to master the ways of the wild and survive.": "也许你逃离了枯燥的文明生活，去寻找冒险，却发现你与这片土地有一种亲和力，如果你留下来，你永远不会发现。或者，你因为聪明和敏捷而被你的首领召见，并被培养为伟大的人。也许你是被狼养大的，在狼群的包围中发现自己是最自在的。重要的是，你学会了使用你的意志和智慧来掌握野外的方式和生存。",
	"You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom and Constitution (though some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting or {@item shield|PHB|shields} prefer Strength to Dexterity). Second, choose the {@background Outlander|PHB} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快地做出一个游侠。首先，让灵巧成为你最高的能力得分，其次是智慧和体质（尽管一些专注于双武器战斗或（%0%）的游侠更喜欢力量而不是灵巧）。第二，选择{@background Outlander|PHB}的背景。",
	"Though most rangers share certain features in common, such as their martial prowess borne of necessity, skills for surviving in averse conditions, and an affinity for animals, their journeys rarely lead them on identical paths. Your choice of a ranger path is a reflection of your own personal journey as a ranger.": "虽然大多数游骑兵都有一些共同的特点，比如他们在必要时的武艺高强，在恶劣条件下的生存技能，以及对动物的亲和力，但他们的旅程很少会走上相同的道路。你对游侠之路的选择是你作为一个游侠的个人旅程的反映。",
	"The Ranger is the elephant in the room. The sheer number of attempts at revision indicate that something about the class is broadly unsatisfying. Players know it; DMs know it; and Homebrewers know it. And many have tried their hand at remaking it, whether they have published their work or not.": "游侠是房间里的大象。试图修改的数量表明，这个等级的某些东西是不令人满意的。玩家们知道这一点；管理员知道这一点；自制者也知道这一点。许多人已经尝试着重新制作它，不管他们是否已经发表了他们的作品。",
	"This is my attempt, and it is not for everyone. Many DMs already allow the use of one or more of the countless ranger variations and their players are happy. But, I'm not worried about those who have found alternatives, nor with those satisfied with minor modifications of the existing class. I'm worried about the ones that despite the vast table of ranger offerings, don't use ranger at all.": "这是我的尝试，但它并不适合所有人。许多管理员已经允许使用无数游侠变体中的一种或多种，他们的玩家也很高兴。但是，我并不担心那些已经找到替代品的人，也不担心那些对现有等级的小修改感到满意的人。我担心的是那些尽管有大量的游侠产品，却根本不使用游侠的人。",
	"So what's wrong with ranger? And how do I fix it differently than other have? As for what's wrong, different brewers point to different things. Some say that it has dead levels and unsatisfying exploration features, or that it lacks a satisfying first level feature, or that Beastmaster is unintuitive, or any other number of specific gripes related to features. For me, it seems like the problem is an identity crisis. Everyone seems to KNOW what a ranger is, but can anyone explain it in a satisfying manner? Then even worse, can anyone design a class that can SHOW that flavor to the players?": "那么，游侠的问题出在哪里？我又该如何以不同于其他人的方式来解决它呢？至于什么是错的，不同的酿酒师指出了不同的事情。有些人说它有死的关卡和不令人满意的探索功能，或者说它缺乏令人满意的第一层功能，或者说兽王是不直观的，或者任何其他与功能有关的具体不满。对我来说，问题似乎是一个身份危机。每个人似乎都知道游侠是什么，但有人能以令人满意的方式解释它吗？更糟的是，有谁能设计出一个可以向玩家展示这种味道的等级？",
	"This class is my answer to those questions. And it has one simple goal: Make Ranger Feel Like a Ranger.": "这门课是我对这些问题的回答。它有一个简单的目标：让游侠感觉自己是个游侠。",
