In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one even cackles loudly at what she sees.": "三位老妪在一个沸腾的大锅前弯腰，大锅里装满了各种奇异的污物，搅动着，冒着有毒的烟雾。在大锅上方的烟雾和水汽中，三人可以分辨出一些重要的形状和数字，其中一个人甚至对她所看到的东西大声地笑了起来。",
	"A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure noone is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree's bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavy-set boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy's eyes.": "一个年轻女孩坐在树下，远离其他孩子玩耍的地方。她瞥了一眼，确保没有人在看，然后对着空旷的空气打了一个响指。沉默片刻后，一只黑猫出现在树弯处，与女孩对视，用一种奇怪的智慧盯着她看了很久。她对其中一个玩耍的孩子做了个手势，那是一个身材魁梧的男孩，脸上永远挂着一副皱纹；猫明白了。它徘徊在男孩身边，伸出爪子，变得很低，准备扑向男孩的眼睛。",

	"While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With gruesome effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torture which plagues them.": "当其他人受到魔法的祝福时，女巫却受到魔法的诅咒。受到一些可恨的奥术的影响，不管是意外还是故意，女巫都被它的日常折磨弄得里外扭曲。通过可怕的努力，她们可以将这种力量转化为法术，用困扰她们的同样的折磨来折磨别人。",
	"Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions about them, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night which prey on innocent people.

	"It is rare to find a witch without his or her constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch's familiar with good reason is ubiquitous to common folk. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.": "很少有女巫没有他或她的常伴--熟悉的人。尽管其他施法者也可能召唤出家人，但对普通人来说，女巫的家人是无处不在的，理由很充分。女巫掌握直观的魔法，并与她们的家人有很深的联系。因此，他们可以召唤出更多奇特的家族成员，并比其他施法者更迅速地指挥他们。",

	"In combat, the hag rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the hag. You decide what action the hag will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. The hag can choose to ignore this action if she sees fit. If you issue no commands, the hag acts and moves as she chooses. The hag is friendly to you and your allies.": "在战斗中，女巫会滚动自己的主动权并在自己的回合中行动。在你的每个回合中，你都可以使用一个额外的行动来在精神上指挥女巫。你可以决定女巫在下一回合将采取什么行动以及在哪里移动，或者你可以发出一个一般性的命令，比如说守卫一个特定的房间或走廊。如果巫婆认为合适的话，她可以选择忽略这个行动。如果你没有发出命令，女巫就会按照自己的选择行动。巫婆对你和你的盟友都很友好。",
