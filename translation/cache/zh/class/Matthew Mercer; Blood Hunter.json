	"Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wild beast. Those that shun the curse spend their lives burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal—humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impulse. Those that embrace the dark nature of their curse learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament that drives the beast within.": "在困扰王国的许多可怕的诅咒中，很少有像狼人症那样古老或令人恐惧的。通过血液传递，这种痛苦使宿主具有野蛮的力量和对野兽暴力的饥渴。那些躲避诅咒的人一生都在把他们的野性、兽性的冲动埋藏在内心深处。然而，上升的满月的力量使诅咒过于强大而无法抵御，宿主变成了一个可怕的动物-人形混血儿，被谋杀的冲动所控制。那些接受诅咒的黑暗性质的人学会了驾驭他们的兽性天赋，但也屈服于驱使内心野兽的邪恶、恶毒的气质。",

Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.": "狼牙骑士团是一个值得骄傲的血族猎人组织，他们接受了 \"驯服\"，即由高级成员施加狼人的仪式。然后，这些猎人利用他们的能力来驾驭他们所怀有的怪物的力量，而不至于让自己迷失在其中。通过对自身意志力的强烈磨练，再加上教团血魔法仪式的秘密，成员们学会了在短时间内控制和释放他们的混合形态。强化的身体素质、非自然的复原力和锋利的爪子使这些战士成为任何与他们擦肩而过的邪恶的可怕敌人。然而，没有任何训练是完美的，如果不注意和完全专注，即使是最伟大的猎血者也会暂时失去自己的嗜血能力。",
	"THE ONUS OF LYCANTHROPY": "狼人的责任",
	"Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible burden it is and the challenges it brings. Where most who embrace this curse grow wicked, mad, even murderous, these blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and blood magic. These factors enable a member of the Order of the Lycan to prevent the spread of their curse through blood, should they wish to. One of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another without the order's sanction.": "那些加入狼人组织的人坚定地选择了这条道路，了解它的可怕负担和它带来的挑战。大多数接受这种诅咒的人变得邪恶、疯狂，甚至杀人，而这些血族猎人接受了野兽的礼物，同时通过严格的训练和血魔法保持控制。这些因素使狼人组织的成员能够防止他们的诅咒通过血液传播，如果他们愿意的话。这个教团最神圣的誓言之一就是在没有教团认可的情况下绝不感染他人。",
	"Should a member of the Order of the Lycan be cured of the lycanthropic curse, it is a terrible shame on their name, the order, and those who carry the curse still.

	"Lycanthropy comes in many forms. Each version of the curse is bound to a specific beast: wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat are a few of the more well-known variations. The strain of the curse defines the beast a hybrid form will share, but the features the curse bestows remain relatively uniform across strains.": "狼人症有多种形式。每个版本的诅咒都与一个特定的野兽有关：狼、熊、虎、野猪和老鼠是几个比较著名的变种。诅咒的品系决定了混合形态的野兽，但诅咒所赋予的特征在不同品系中保持相对统一。",
