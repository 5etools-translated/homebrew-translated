	"Exotic weapons, armor, and shields are pieces of equipment that require an incredible level of skill to wield or wear properly, as they are often either unusually heavy, oddly balanced, or bizarre in construction. As such, no class other than the craftsman gains proficiency with any exotic weapons or armor. To gain proficiency with a piece of exotic equipment, you must take the Exotic Mastery feat.": "异国武器、盔甲和盾牌是需要难以置信的技能水平才能正确挥舞或穿戴的装备，因为它们通常要么异常沉重，要么平衡奇特，要么结构奇特。因此，除了工匠之外，其他等级的人都无法获得对任何异国武器或盔甲的熟练度。要获得对一件异域装备的熟练度，你必须参加异域精通特技。",

	"Almost too heavy and cumbersome to wear, even for the strongest of warriors, mountain plate consists of a suit of inch-thick plate armor with a bolted-on helmet, gauntlets, and boots. Donning mountain plate takes nearly 15 minutes, and requires latching a number of heavy-duty clamps and latches. Mountain plate is exceptionally large and heavy: it requires an 18 Strength to wear, cannot be worn by creatures smaller than Medium size, and reduces your walking speed by 5 feet, regardless of your Strength score.": "即使是最强壮的战士也几乎无法穿戴，山地甲由一套一英寸厚的板甲组成，上面有一个螺栓连接的头盔、护手和靴子。穿上山地甲需要将近15分钟，并需要锁上一些重型夹子和锁扣。山地板甲特别大、特别重：它需要18的力量才能穿戴，小于中等体型的生物不能穿戴，而且无论你的力量值如何，都会使你的行走速度降低5英尺。",

	"Even larger than a tower shield, a wall shield is a massive, door-sized shield with a set of imposing spikes set into the bottom edge, facing the ground. It is much more cumbersome to use and proves to be a bit less effective than a tower shield in normal melee combat.
