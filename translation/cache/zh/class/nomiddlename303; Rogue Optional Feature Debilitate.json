	"Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.": "示意她的同伴等待，一个半身人蹑手蹑脚地穿过地牢大厅。她把耳朵贴在门上，然后掏出一套工具，眨眼间就把锁打开了。然后她消失在阴影中，她的战士朋友上前将门踢开。",
	"A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.": "一个人类潜伏在小巷的阴影中，而他的同伙则准备好了她在伏击中的角色。当他们的目标--一个臭名昭著的奴隶主--经过巷子时，同伙大叫起来，奴隶主前来调查，刺客的刀在他发出声音之前就割断了他的喉咙。",
	"Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.": "一个地精压抑着笑声，挥舞着手指，神奇地从警卫的腰带上取下了钥匙环。一会儿，钥匙就到了她的手里，牢房的门被打开了，她和她的同伴们可以自由地逃跑了。",
	"Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.": "罗格依靠技巧、隐蔽性和他们敌人的弱点在任何情况下都能占上风。他们善于找到解决任何问题的办法，表现出足智多谋和多才多艺，是任何成功的冒险队伍的基石。",
	"Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.": "流氓在掌握各种技能的使用方面所付出的努力与他们在完善战斗能力方面所付出的努力一样多，这使他们具有其他角色所不能比拟的广泛的专业知识。许多流氓专注于隐身和欺骗，而其他流氓则完善了在地下城环境中帮助他们的技能，如攀爬、寻找和解除陷阱以及开锁等。",
	"When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.": "当涉及到战斗时，流氓优先考虑的是狡猾而不是蛮力。一个流氓宁可进行一次精确的攻击，把它准确地放在对目标伤害最大的地方，也不愿意用一连串的攻击把对手耗死。流氓在躲避危险方面有一种近乎超自然的诀窍，少数人学会了魔法技巧来补充他们的其他能力。",
	"Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.": "每个城镇和城市都有它的流氓份额。他们中的大多数人都符合这个阶层最糟糕的刻板印象，以盗窃者、刺客、小偷和骗子为生。通常情况下，这些恶棍被组织成盗贼公会或犯罪家族。很多流氓都是独立行动的，但即使他们有时也会招募学徒来帮助他们进行诈骗和抢劫。少数流氓以锁匠、调查员或灭虫员的身份谋生，这在一个可怕的老鼠和狼人在下水道里出没的世界里，可能是一份危险的工作。",
	"As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.": "作为冒险家，流氓属于法律的两边。有些人是顽固的罪犯，决定在宝藏中寻找他们的财富，而另一些人则是为了逃避法律而开始了冒险的生活。有些人学习并完善了他们的技能，其明确的目的是潜入古代遗迹和隐藏的地窖寻找宝藏。",
	"As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?": "当你创建你的流氓角色时，考虑这个角色与法律的关系。你是否有犯罪的过去或现在？你是在逃避法律还是在逃避愤怒的盗贼公会会长？或者你是为了寻找更大的风险和更大的回报而离开公会的？是贪婪驱使你去冒险，还是其他的欲望或理想？",
	"What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.": "是什么触发了你离开你以前的生活？一个伟大的骗局或抢劫案出了大问题，是否导致你重新评估你的职业？也许你很幸运，一次成功的抢劫给了你所需的硬币，让你摆脱了贫苦的生活。流浪的欲望最终召唤你离开你的家吗？也许你突然发现自己与家人或导师断绝了联系，你不得不找到新的支持手段。或者你结识了一位新朋友--你的冒险队伍中的另一位成员--他向你展示了谋生和运用你特殊才能的新可能性。",
	"You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the {@background charlatan} background.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名游侠。首先，灵巧应该是你的最高能力得分。如果你想在调查方面有所建树，或者打算采用奥术诡计师的原型，那么智力应该是你的次高分。如果你打算强调欺骗和社会交往，则选择魅力。第二，选择（%0%）背景。",
	"People forget that the entire point of venturing down into a dusty tomb is to bring back the prizes hidden away there. Fighting is for fools. Dead men can't spend their fortunes.": "人们忘记了，冒险进入尘封的坟墓的全部意义是为了带回藏在那里的奖品。战斗是为傻瓜准备的。死人不能花费他们的财富。",
	"When brute force won't get the job done, or when magic isn't available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.": "当蛮力无法完成工作时，或者当魔法无法使用或不合适时，流氓就会出现在前面。凭借与隐身术、潜行术和诡计相关的技能，流氓可以以其他角色无法模仿的方式进入和摆脱麻烦。",
	"Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.": "一些转向冒险的流氓曾经是罪犯，他们认为躲避怪物比保持领先法律一步要好。还有一些人是职业杀手，在合同期内寻找有利可图的应用他们的才能。有些人只是喜欢克服任何挡在他们面前的挑战的快感。",
	"On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach—few rogues enjoy combat—with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue's mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.": "在冒险中，流氓很可能会将外表上的谨慎态度--很少有流氓喜欢战斗--与对战利品的饥渴相混合。大多数时候，在流氓的脑海中，拿起武器对付一个生物并不是为了杀死这个生物，而是为了成为其财宝的新主人。",
	"The following sections explore certain facets of what it means to be a rogue, which you can use to add depth to your character.": "下面的章节探讨了成为一个流氓的某些方面，你可以用它来增加你的角色的深度。",
	"Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking—an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky.": "流氓所做的大部分事情都是围绕着获得宝藏和防止其他人做同样的事情。在实现这些目标的过程中，几乎没有任何阻碍，只是许多流氓被一种蒙蔽他们思维的强迫症所诱惑，一种不可抗拒的需求必须得到满足，即使这样做是有风险的。",
	"A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.": "一个流氓的罪恶感可以是获得一件实物，可以是体验到的东西，也可以是在某些时候的行为方式。例如，一个流氓可能无法拒绝任何银制的战利品，即使这些战利品挂在城堡守卫的脖子上。另一个人在城市里一天不拿一两个钱包是不行的，只是为了保持练习。",
	"What's the one form of temptation that your rogue character can't resist when the opportunity presents itself, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and your companions?": "什么是你的流氓角色在机会出现时无法抗拒的一种诱惑，即使屈服于它可能意味着你和你的同伴有麻烦？",

	"Naturally, those who enforce the law are bound to come up against those who break it, and it's the rare rogue who isn't featured on at least one wanted poster. Beyond that, it's in the nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they're likely to be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch.": "自然，那些执法者必然会遇到那些违反法律的人，而且很少有流氓不在至少一张通缉令上出现。除此之外，由于他们的职业性质，流氓经常与犯罪分子接触，无论是出于选择还是出于需要。其中一些人也可能是对手，而且他们很可能比普通的城市巡警成员更难对付。",
	"If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to come up with a reason why an adversary has appeared in your life. Perhaps you've been the subject of scrutiny for a while from someone who wants to use you for nefarious purposes and has just now become known to you. Such an incident could be the basis for an upcoming adventure.": "如果你的角色的背景故事中还没有这类人物，你可以和你的管理员一起想出一个对手出现在你生活中的理由。也许你已经被某个想利用你达到邪恶目的的人监视了一段时间，现在才被你知道。这样的事件可以成为即将到来的冒险的基础。",

	"If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor did for you without realizing who was responsible, and that person has now just become known to you. Who helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the time, and what do you owe that person as recompense?": "如果你的角色的背景故事中还没有这类人物，你可以和你的管理员一起确定为什么一个恩人会出现在你的生活中。也许你从你的恩人为你做的事情中受益，却没有意识到是谁在负责，而这个人现在才被你认识。过去是谁帮助了你，无论你当时是否知道，你欠那个人什么作为补偿？",
