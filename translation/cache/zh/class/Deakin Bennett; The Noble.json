The king, who has done nothing but hone his talents as a leader and as a noble. Nobles come in all shapes and sizes, but nobility can be more than a background. Characters who wish to fully devote themselves to their noble background, utilizing the majesty of their royal blood and aristocratic lineage can be true leaders and aids in a group. In short, nobles epitimoze their role and put their energy into developing their status and power as a noble. Thus, the noble class born.": "这片土地上的王子，拿起他的剑，保卫他未来的王国不受动乱的影响。饱受打击的公主，决定现在是她从事冒险的时候。国王，除了磨练自己作为领导者和贵族的才能外，什么都没做。贵族有各种形状和大小，但贵族身份可以不只是一个背景。那些希望全身心投入贵族背景的角色，利用他们的王室血统和贵族血统的威严，可以成为一个团体中真正的领导者和助手。简而言之，贵族们将自己的角色表象化，并将自己的精力投入到发展自己作为贵族的地位和权力上。因此，贵族阶层诞生了。",
	"Nobles are inherently dependent upon their title and bloodline of being nobles. That being said, it is very important to understand the house that you belong to. What are your traditions? What is your house's reputation? Work with your DM to construct not only your own character's nobility, but that of your house. Consider, also, if you are a stereotype of your house or if you contrast against its traditions.": "贵族在本质上取决于他们的头衔和作为贵族的血统。既然如此，了解你所属的家族是非常重要的。你们的传统是什么？你们家族的声誉如何？与你的DM合作，不仅要构建你自己角色的贵族身份，还要构建你的家族的贵族身份。还要考虑，你是否是你的家族的刻板印象，或者你是否与它的传统形成对比。",
	"It is important to understand what you are a noble of as well. A castle? A vast land? Who is the king? Queen? Who governs it? Are you the ruler, yet too young and a regent governs in your stead? Consider developing storyline archs that force you out of your land or castle towards adventure and intrigue, so that you can function within a party. This class, perhaps more so than others, require extra consideration by the DM. The world setting must value, in some ways and in some areas, the concept of a fuedal or aristocratic society, otherwise who would care that someone calls themselve a noble? ": "了解你是什么贵族也是很重要的。一座城堡？一片广阔的土地？谁是国王？女王？谁管理着它？你是统治者，但太年轻，由摄政者代替你管理？考虑制定故事情节，迫使你离开你的土地或城堡，走向冒险和阴谋，这样你就可以在一个聚会中发挥作用。这个类别，也许比其他类别更需要DM的额外考虑。世界的设定必须在某些方面和某些领域重视封建社会或贵族社会的概念，否则谁会关心有人称自己为贵族？",
	"Majesty is the key power of a noble. It is the sum of their charisma, influence, social power, and prowess with their presence. Many of the effects of majesty function like magic. A noble can command a creature to kneel and, like magical compulsion, should the creature fail their saving throw they must obey the command. However, it is not magical compulsion that forces the creature to kneel: it is the presence of nobility and the awesome power of potent charisma.": "陛下是一个贵族的关键力量。它是他们的魅力、影响力、社会权力和临场发挥的能力的总和。许多威严的效果就像魔法一样。一个贵族可以命令一个生物下跪，并且像魔法强迫一样，如果该生物的救赎失败，他们必须服从命令。然而，迫使生物下跪的并不是魔法强制力：而是贵族的存在和强大魅力的可怕力量。",
	"But what of an orc who cares nothing for the nobility or fuedal societies of humans or elves? Generally, some chaotic creatures who are the epitome of chaos, such as orcs, goblins, etc., may not care about a noble's majesty. Your DM may decide that some creatures may have advantage against any non-magical effects, such as all noble's ability to use suggestion with their majesty score. The DM should consider thoughtfully whether or not a creature adheres to chaotic philosophies and has no form of hierarchy within their own cultural or ethnic background to grant them this resistance to noble abilities. This advantage would only apply to effects that are drawn directly from spells.": "但是，一个对人类或精灵的贵族或富贵社会毫不关心的兽人呢？一般来说，一些混沌生物是混沌的缩影，如兽人、地精等，可能并不关心贵族的威严。你的DM可以决定，有些生物可能对任何非魔法效果有优势，比如所有贵族用威严分数使用暗示的能力。DM应该深思熟虑地考虑一个生物是否坚持混乱的哲学，并且在他们自己的文化或种族背景中没有任何形式的等级制度，以授予他们这种对贵族能力的抵抗。这种优势只适用于直接来自法术的效果。",
