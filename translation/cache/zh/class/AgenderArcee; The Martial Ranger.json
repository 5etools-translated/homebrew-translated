	"Rangers may live on the fringes of civilization, but the wilderness is their true home. Rangers have a deep connection to the land they make their home, and all its flora and fauna. Living off the land is second nature to them: they are well-versed in tracking, hunting and gathering, reading the subtle messages hidden in the terrain. The ranger lives in this world, yet stands apart from it; their knowledge, ingenuity and craftsmanship set them apart from wild beasts. Instead, the ranger lives in balance between nature and civilization, one foot in each world, protecting each from the other's encroachment, and threats from beyond.": "游骑兵可能生活在文明的边缘，但荒野才是他们真正的家。游骑兵与他们作为家园的土地以及所有的动植物都有着深厚的联系。依靠土地生活是他们的第二天性：他们精通追踪、狩猎和采集，阅读隐藏在地形中的微妙信息。护林员生活在这个世界上，但又与之分离；他们的知识、智慧和手艺使他们与野生动物不同。相反，护林员生活在自然和文明之间的平衡中，每一个世界都有一只脚，保护每一个世界免受另一个世界的侵袭，以及来自外部的威胁。",
	"As master warriors of the wilderness, rangers are rarely satisfied with mundane quarry, and learn specialized techniques to hunt the monsters that threaten their beloved balance: humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Once they have the scent, a ranger will follow their prey to the ends of the earth, and finish them with deadly skill.": "作为荒野的主战者，游骑兵很少满足于普通的猎物，他们学习专门的技术来猎杀威胁到他们心爱的平衡的怪物：人形突袭者、横冲直撞的野兽和怪兽、可怕的巨人和致命的龙。他们学会了像捕食者一样追踪他们的猎物，在荒野中隐秘地移动，把自己藏在灌木和瓦砾中。一旦嗅到了气味，游侠就会追随猎物到天涯海角，以致命的技巧结束它们。",
	"Many rangers make their living as hunters, guides or trackers in their home territory, but others hear the call of new lands to explore, greater prey to conquer, and helpless people in need of protection and guidance. Taking little with them but what they can carry and perhaps a beast companion, these rangers pursue the calling of the adventurer.": "许多游侠在他们的家乡以猎人、向导或追踪者为生，但也有人听到了新的土地需要探索、更大的猎物需要征服，以及无助的人们需要保护和指导的呼唤。除了他们能携带的东西和可能的野兽伙伴，这些游骑兵几乎没有携带任何东西，他们追求冒险家的召唤。",
	"Accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath, rangers are well-suited to the adventuring lifestyle, though their fierce independence may put them at odds with fellow travelers. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.": "习惯了远离干爽的床和热水澡的生活，游骑兵很适合冒险的生活方式，尽管他们激烈的独立性可能会使他们与同伴发生冲突。面对那些在城市长大的冒险家，他们对野外的艰难困苦喋喋不休，游侠们的反应是混合着欢笑、沮丧和同情的。但他们很快就知道，其他能够在战斗中承担自己体重的冒险者是值得任何额外负担的。娇生惯养的城市人可能不知道如何养活自己或在野外寻找淡水，但他们在其他方面弥补了这一点。",
	"As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities.

Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore.": "当你创建游侠角色时，考虑一下赋予你特殊能力的训练的性质。你是自学成才，通过在荒野中生存的需要，学会了战斗技巧、追踪和自然疗法？你是否与导师一起训练，一起在荒野中游荡，直到掌握了游侠的方法？你是否离开了你的学徒生涯，或者你的导师被杀了--也许是被那种成为你最喜欢的敌人的怪物所杀？或者你是作为隶属于德鲁伊教派的游侠队伍中的一员学习了你的技能，在神秘的道路和荒野的传说中接受训练。",
