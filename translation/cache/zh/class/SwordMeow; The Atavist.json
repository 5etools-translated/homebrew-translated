	"An armored frontlining human takes blow after blow, and when she begins to weaken, she becomes all the more savage—hitting harder, striking faster, dying slower. A wounded dog is lethal, but a wounded atavist is a bloody nightmare. With caution halfway around the world, she wounds her own arm, but the enemy falls to the ground as he takes all the pain. Another foe comes near, but finding her only stronger than she was previous.": "一个身穿铠甲的前线人类遭受了一次又一次的打击，而当她开始衰弱时，她变得更加野蛮--打击力度更大，打击速度更快，死亡速度更慢。一只受伤的狗是致命的，但一个受伤的阿塔瓦人是一个血腥的噩梦。在半路上，她小心翼翼地打伤了自己的手臂，但敌人在承受所有的痛苦时倒在了地上。另一个敌人靠近，但发现她只比以前更强。",
	"An orc throws more than his all into each blow, hurting himself in a magical effort to strengthen his blows, but knows it's not enough. He stills and lets the alien forces take over his mind, as his body erupts aberrant flesh strips, covering him entirely, growing out of holes and hairs—eyes darkening and true horror creeping. If his mark doesn't falter at the mere sight of the abomination, he will soon fall in battle.": "一个兽人在每一次打击中都倾注了更多的心血，在加强打击的神奇努力中伤害了自己，但他知道这还不够。他静下心来，让外来的力量接管他的思想，因为他的身体爆发出反常的肉条，完全覆盖了他，长出了洞和毛发--眼睛变黑了，真正的恐怖在爬行。如果他的标记不在仅仅看到憎恶的时候动摇，他很快就会在战斗中倒下。",
	"The fireball rounds the corners of the maze, the wizard's foul fire chasing his would be killer down the hall, but a sacrificial slight crippling of his arm gives him the power he needs to dodge out of the fiery current.": "火球绕过迷宫的各个角落，巫师的污秽之火在大厅里追逐他的将死之人，但他的手臂被牺牲掉的轻微残缺给了他需要的力量，使他躲避出火流。",
	"No matter their upbringing, race, culture, or even time period, atavists are united by their ability to make use of their own vitality in their weaponplay. There may have been bloodlines at one point, but those are gone now.": "无论他们的成长经历、种族、文化，甚至是时间段，阿塔夫主义者都因其在武器游戏中利用自身活力的能力而团结起来。也许曾经有过血统，但现在已经没有了。",
	"Before iron, before the blade, before organized cities, there were the atavists—using the only tools they had available: their bodies and their magic. In tandem, they use these dual aspects to protect, to conquer, to hunt monsters, or to achieve any other ends.": "在铁器之前，在刀剑之前，在有组织的城市之前，有一个太极拳师--使用他们唯一可用的工具：他们的身体和他们的魔法。他们串联起来，利用这两个方面来保护、征服、猎杀怪物，或达到任何其他目的。",
	"These people build on failure. They take their combat training of reflexive attacks when they're hurt and apply it to their lives: those that wrong atavists should know they will be struck back ten times harder. Some atavists even enjoy being attacked, hurt or betrayed, and use it as an excuse to hit back.": "这些人建立在失败之上。他们把自己受伤时的反射性攻击的战斗训练运用到生活中：那些错怪了太虚者的人应该知道他们会受到十倍的反击。有些太虚者甚至喜欢被攻击、被伤害或被背叛，并以此为借口进行反击。",
	"Atavists can come from anywhere in the world: tribes, kingdoms, royalty, or gutter poor; however, those peoples that trend towards using hemomancy and other necrotic, vitality-affected powers would seem to have a higher chance of a child with atavistic powers.": "Atavists可以来自世界上的任何地方：部落、王国、皇室或贫民窟；然而，那些倾向于使用占卜术和其他坏死的、受生命力影响的力量的民族，似乎有更高的机会让孩子拥有Atavistic力量。",
	"Magic that drains and takes from you is a studied and developed field that comes from atavists first. They started blood magic. But, what started the atavists? How did atavists begin in your setting—or is a piece of history lost long ago? Is it even important? Has it began multiple times, or can be it be restarted or instilled into potential users a variety of ways? Or, is every atavist in the same family tree, leading farther and farther back; it might lead to creatures beyond humanoids, perhaps from some union of opposite beings; or from a creature who has long left this universe.": "榨取和夺取你的魔法是一个经过研究和开发的领域，首先来自阿塔夫。他们开始了血魔法。但是，是什么开始了altavists？atavists在你的设定中是如何开始的--或者说是一段早已丢失的历史？它甚至很重要吗？它已经开始了多次，或者它可以被重新启动或以各种方式灌输给潜在的使用者？或者，每一个太虚者都在同一个家谱中，越来越远；它可能会导致超越人类的生物，也许来自一些相反的生命的结合；或者来自一个早已离开这个宇宙的生物。",
	"The power to use one's own body in a general sense has been around for eons. Atavism is tied and twisted around that idea. To those born with the talent, it's no more difficult than training an instrument for others - the inclination was born into them. However, many atavists were not simply born with it - through the prowess of a strong blood warrior, a child can be formed and shaped physically, giving him or her a much higher chance of developing atavistic powers. It's up to you to decide how you obtained this talent.": "在一般意义上，使用自己身体的权力已经存在了好几个世纪。Atavism是围绕着这一想法进行捆绑和扭曲的。对那些生来就有这种天赋的人来说，这并不比为别人训练乐器更困难--这种倾向是天生的。然而，许多无神论者并不只是生来就有--通过一个强大的血族战士的亲身经历，一个孩子可以在身体上得到形成和塑造，使他或她有更大的机会发展无神论的力量。至于你是如何获得这种天赋的，就看你自己了。",
	"Many classes in Dungeons and Dragons have a clear indication and will for what a member would be doing—wizards study magic, paladins take up the cause of righteousness, and clerics serve their gods. But, many atavists have no such direction. If your character was ingrained with these powers through a blood rite, the question is, why?": "龙与地下城中的许多等级都有明确的指示和意愿，说明成员会做什么--魔法师研究魔法，圣骑士从事正义事业，牧师服务他们的神。但是，许多阿塔瓦人没有这样的方向。如果你的角色是通过血缘仪式被灌输了这些力量，问题是，为什么？",
	"The same question exists for those who were born with the abilities. Are you part of some tangential, many-webbed plan of a deity or another powerful being, or was it just chance?": "对于那些天生就有能力的人来说，也存在同样的问题。你是神灵或其他强大存在的一些切身的、有很多网状结构的计划的一部分，还是只是偶然？",
	"If you don't know the answers—like many of those in the world do not know the purpose of their lives—you decide it. Maybe you don't care, and you focus on what you want and how you can get it in the future, instead of dwelling on the past.": "如果你不知道答案，就像世界上许多人不知道他们生活的目的一样，你就决定它。也许你不在乎，你专注于你想要的东西，以及你如何在未来得到它，而不是纠缠于过去。",
	"The magic used (or abused) by atavists is normally questionable at best in most cultures, and when under close examination, can often be found to be a type that is commonly disowned, unsupported, and generally looked down on. This creates prejudice against atavists. They are more often cast as villains in stories, and tend not to be heroes; at least, in most of the world. It's harder for an atavist to be admired and easier to villainize.": "在大多数文化中，太上老君使用（或滥用）的魔法通常充其量是有问题的，而且当仔细检查时，往往可以发现是一种通常不被认可、不被支持、普遍被看不起的类型。这就造成了对无神论者的偏见。他们在故事中更多地被当作恶棍，而往往不是英雄；至少，在世界的大多数地方。一个无神论者更难被钦佩，更容易被反派化。",
	"If you have hidden your powers, or put them to an unusual cause, what effect has that had on how confident your character is? Would 'I was born like this'as a defense have held up wherever you came from?": "如果你隐藏了你的能力，或者把它们放在一个不寻常的原因上，这对你的角色的信心有什么影响？无论你从哪里来，\"我生来如此 \"作为辩护词是否站得住脚？",
	"The most important question to consider when creating your atavist is the effect that their powers have had on them—and how those effects and powers were treated by those around you. Did you lose sets of friends due to fearful ignorance? Did your family embrace and accept you for who you are, or did they turn a blind eye to your powers and hope they—or maybe you—would disappear?": "在创造你的阿塔维斯特时要考虑的最重要的问题是他们的力量对他们的影响--以及这些影响和力量被你周围的人如何对待。你是否因为恐惧的无知而失去了几组朋友？你的家人是否拥抱并接受了你，还是对你的超能力视而不见，希望他们--或者你--消失？",
	"Atavists are known for their rigid health, physicality, and aptitude for circumstantially evil magics. Certain sages and other scholars would love to study you, or those with the same motives and less morals may pose a danger to you; maybe they already have. Do you wish you could hide or remove your power? Or do you want to defeat the stereotype you're applied and become a hero?": "Atavists以其僵硬的健康、身体素质和周身邪恶魔法的能力而闻名。某些圣人和其他学者很想研究你，或者那些具有相同动机和较少道德的人可能对你构成危险；也许他们已经这样做了。你是否希望你能隐藏或消除你的力量？或者你想打败你所应用的刻板印象，成为一个英雄？",
	"After your journey begins as an atavist, it might happen upon a new road. Are you a brutal warrior who wants to be attacked - a jaded, wearied soldier who will never fall? Are you a hopeful and strong warrior that has fallen to afflictions of the mind; the inluence of strange beings, that are a cursed blessing? Or are you a ruthless killer, lethal and weaponized, who will not stop to get what they want? Maybe you pledge yourself to or are pledged by a powerful fiend, who is respectful of your blood magic, and extends a fiery hand of power for you to grasp. You might even divine more power from meditation and self-reflection, with the idea that the more time you spend with yourself, the more able you are.": "在你的旅程开始后，作为一个异教徒，它可能会发生在一个新的道路上。你是一个希望被攻击的残酷的战士--一个厌倦了的、永不倒下的士兵？你是一个充满希望和坚强的战士，但却倒在了心灵的折磨中；陌生生命的影响，是一种被诅咒的祝福？或者你是一个无情的杀手，致命和武器化，不会为得到他们想要的东西而停下来？也许你把自己许配给一个强大的魔鬼，或者被一个强大的魔鬼许配，他尊重你的血魔法，并为你伸出一只火热的力量之手。你甚至可能从冥想和自我反省中获得更多的力量，认为你花在自己身上的时间越多，你就越有能力。",
	"You can make an atavist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Dexterity (depending on what kind of martial character you want). Second, choose the {@background Soldier} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快地做出一个太极拳手。首先，宪法应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是力量或灵巧（取决于你想要什么样的武术角色）。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"You can tap into your raw health to deliver death. You have a rend die which powers certain class features, and is a {@dice d6}. When you rend, you roll this die and lose hitpoints equal to the result, which can't be reduced in any way. You can't rend more than once for a feature unless the effect says so.": "你可以利用你的原始健康来传递死亡。你有一个 \"毁灭 \"的骰子，它为某些等级的特征提供能量，并且是一个（%0%）。当你释放时，你掷出这个骰子并失去与结果相等的命中率，这个命中率不能以任何方式减少。除非效果说明，否则你不能为某项功能释放超过一次。",
	"When a feature says that you can rend to a roll, it means that you can rend yourself and add the result of the rend die to the roll. You can rend yourself to any damage roll for an attack with a melee weapon as a part of the {@spell Attack} action, for a spell attack, for a reaction, or for a bonus action. You can rend any amount of times per turn.": "当一个特征说你可以对一个卷轴进行撕扯时，它的意思是你可以撕扯自己并将撕扯模子的结果加入卷轴中。在用近战武器攻击时，你可以在任何伤害卷中加入自己，作为{@spell Attack}行动的一部分，用于法术攻击，用于反应，或用于奖励行动。你可以在每一回合内进行任何数量的撕扯。",
	"At 7th level, you can rend to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and you can roll {@dice 2d6} for your rend dice. At 14th level, you can roll {@dice 3d6}, and {@dice 4d6} at 20th.": "在7级时，你可以对力量、灵巧和体质的救赎进行撕扯，并且你可以为你的撕扯骰子掷出（%0%）。在14级时，你可以掷出{@dice 3d6}，在20级时可以掷出{@dice 4d6}。",
	"There are a couple variants that stem from the standard version: the painless variant and the painful variant, which make it easier or harder to play. With your DM's permission (or ruling), use one of the variants below.": "有几个源于标准版本的变体：无痛变体和有痛变体，它们使游戏更容易或更难。如果你的管理员允许（或裁定），可以使用下面的变体之一。",
	"You have a {@dice d8} for your hit dice (8 + CON mod hitpoints at 1st), instead of a {@dice d6}. Your rend dice begin as a {@dice d4} and progress to {@dice 2d4}, {@dice 3d4}, and {@dice 4d4}.": "你的命中率是{@dice d8}，而不是{@dice d6}。你的伤害骰子开始是{@dice d4}，然后是{@dice 2d4}、{@dice 3d4}和{@dice 4d4}。",
	"You have a {@dice d4} for your hit dice (4 + CON mod hitpoints at 1st), instead of a {@dice d6}. Your rend dice begin as a {@dice d4} and progress to {@dice 2d8}, {@dice 3d8}, and {@dice 4d8}.": "你的命中率是{@dice d4}，而不是{@dice d6}。你的伤害骰子开始是{@dice d4}，然后是{@dice 2d8}、{@dice 3d8}和{@dice 4d8}。",
	"Once per turn, when rending yourself would reduce you to 0 hitpoints, you are instead reduced to 1. Additionally, you are proficient in death saving throws, and if the result of a death saving throw you make is 18 or higher, you regain 1 hitpoint.": "每回合一次，当撕裂自己会使你的命中率降至0时，你反而会降至1。此外，你精通死亡救赎，如果你做的死亡救赎的结果是18或更高，你会重新获得1点生命值。",
	"By 2nd level, your physical essence—either through your family, the blessing of some divine (or unholy) being, or even through sheer chance has produced a fortified and living ichor within you, wieldable for magical prowess. See {@book chapter 10|PHB|10} for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the {@filter atavist spell list|spells|class=Atavist (Atavist)}.": "到了第二级，你的身体本质--无论是通过你的家族、某个神圣的（或不神圣的）存在的祝福，甚至是通过纯粹的机会，在你体内产生了一种强化的、活生生的巫术，可以挥洒出魔法的力量。咒语的一般规则见{@book chapter 10|PHB|10}，本文件末尾见{@filter atavist spell list|spells|class=Atavist (Atavist)}。",
	"The Atavist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your atavist spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.": "Atavist表显示了你有多少个法术槽来施展你的法术。要施展你的一个1级或更高等级的阿塔维斯特法术，你必须消耗一个与该法术等级相同或更高的法术槽。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。",
	"You prepare the list of atavist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the atavist spell list.

With a Constitution of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell inflict wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一个5级的无神论者，你有四个1级和两个2级的法术槽。在体质为14的情况下，你准备的法术清单可以包括四个1级或2级的法术，以任何方式组合。如果你准备了1级法术（%0%），你可以用1级或2级法术槽来施放它。施放该法术并不会从你的准备法术列表中移除。",

	"Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your atavist spells, since the power of your magic relies on your own blood. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an atavist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "体质是你的阿塔维斯特法术的施法能力，因为你的魔法的力量依赖于你自己的血液。每当法术提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的体质。此外，在设定你所施展的异教徒法术的蓄力DC时，以及在使用异教徒法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的体质修改器。",
