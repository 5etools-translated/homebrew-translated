	"A rugged dwarf trudges through snowbanks nearly as high as she is tall, walking in the furrows plowed by the giant badger a few steps ahead. A shimmering crystal feather lets them know they're still on the trail of the elusive ice phoenix.": "一个粗犷的矮人在几乎和她身高一样高的雪堆中跋涉，走在前面几步的巨獾犁出的沟里。一根闪闪发光的水晶羽毛让他们知道他们仍在追踪那只难以捉摸的冰凤凰。",
	"An elf slinks through forest shadows to check the traps she's laid, while a circling hawk keeps watch for predators and poachers. Just a few more samples and they can take a break, but the trick is getting to the traps before the local predators do.": "一个精灵在森林的阴影中溜达，检查她布下的陷阱，而一只盘旋的老鹰则在观察捕食者和偷猎者。只要再做几个样本，他们就可以休息了，但关键是要在当地的捕食者之前找到陷阱。",
	"Perching carefully on a giant lily pad, a halfling studies the behavior of the fish in the lagoon as they are herded back and forth by a massive serpent. With any luck, the data they collect will help the fisherfolk in the nearby village build better boats and save their dying industry.": "一个半身人小心翼翼地栖息在一个巨大的荷花池上，研究泻湖里的鱼的行为，因为它们被一条巨大的蛇来回驱赶。如果运气好的话，他们收集的数据将帮助附近村庄的渔民建造更好的船只，拯救他们濒临灭绝的产业。",
	"A zoologist will brave any environment in order to seek out rare animals and discover ones previously unknown. While most respect the natural world, it typically doesn't hold the same reverence for them as for druids; instead, they tend to view it as a massive laboratory full of living experiments to study—and, in many cases, befriend.": "动物学家会勇敢地在任何环境中寻找稀有动物，并发现以前未知的动物。虽然大多数人尊重自然界，但自然界通常不会像德鲁伊那样尊重他们；相反，他们倾向于将自然界视为一个巨大的实验室，充满了可供研究的活体实验，而且在许多情况下，还与之交好。",
	"Zoologists occupy a unique role in the adventuring world. Less prone to fanatacism than druids, more engaged with society than rangers, and more practical than wizards, they use their scholastic knowledge to blaze a trail through the dangers of the world in pursuit of knowledge. The greatest joy for a zoologist comes from the discovery of a previously unknown species.": "动物学家在冒险世界中占据了一个独特的角色。他们比德鲁伊更不喜欢狂热，比游侠更喜欢参与社会活动，比巫师更实用，他们利用自己的学术知识在世界的危险中开辟一条追求知识的道路。对动物学家来说，最大的快乐来自于发现一个以前未知的物种。",
	"Their knowledge, however, is not always benevolent. While nearly every zoologist professes to love animals, some really like the way they taste! A zoologist's extensive knowledge can come in handy for finding new uses for creatures, such as distilling a new poison or medicine from its secretions, or merely figuring out how to make that strange creature edible. There is no singular guiding moral principle for these adventurous scholars—although the balance does tip in favor of animal conservation.": "然而，他们的知识并不总是善意的。虽然几乎每个动物学家都自称喜欢动物，但有些人却真的喜欢它们的味道 动物学家的广泛知识可以为生物找到新的用途，例如从其分泌物中提炼出新的毒药或药物，或者仅仅是想出如何使这种奇怪的生物可以食用。对于这些富有冒险精神的学者来说，没有单一的指导性道德原则--尽管天平确实倾向于动物保护。",
	"For many zoologists, their most prized possession is the bestiary they create over the course of their careers. Some keep loose, hastily scribbled notes while others produce gorgeously illustrated manuscripts. No matter what it looks like, this knowledge represents their life's work. Every danger they face, hazard they overcome, and wound they dress is all in service of their passion for animals.": "对于许多动物学家来说，他们最珍贵的财产是他们在职业生涯中创建的兽皮书。有些人保留着松散的、匆忙涂抹的笔记，而另一些人则制作了华丽的插图手稿。无论它看起来像什么，这些知识都代表了他们一生的工作。他们面对的每一个危险，克服的每一个危险，穿戴的每一个伤口，都是为他们对动物的热情服务。",
	"Many zoologists aren't satisfied with just collecting notes, however. In order to learn all they can, they often capture animals in the wild. Some release them after close inspection, while others specialize in finding buyers for the rare specimens they collect. A few end their adventures and instead use their knowledge to oversee various applications of animal husbandry.": "然而，许多动物学家并不满足于仅仅收集笔记。为了了解他们所能了解的一切，他们经常在野外捕捉动物。一些人在仔细检查后将它们释放，而另一些人则专门为他们收集的稀有标本寻找买家。一些人结束了他们的冒险，转而利用他们的知识来监督动物饲养的各种应用。",
	"Consider what it is about the scholar-adventurer life of a zoologist that called you to this path. Perhaps you were you raised by rangers, but lack their physical prowess and found a different way to share their interests. Maybe a blight on local herds sparked an interest in animal husbandry.

Did you see an exotic creature in a traveling carnival and resolve to spend your life in search of other living wonders?": "考虑一下，是什么让动物学家的学者-冒险家生活召唤你走上这条道路。也许你是你被护林员养大的，但缺乏他们的体能，于是找到了一种不同的方式来分享他们的兴趣。也许当地畜群的枯萎激发了你对动物饲养的兴趣。你的第一个和最好的朋友是动物吗？你是否在旅行嘉年华会上看到了一种异国的生物，并决心用你的生命去寻找其他的生命奇迹？",
