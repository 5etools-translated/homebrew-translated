	"Seeing the unique identity that ranger has, many have come up with great ideas that flesh out that identity even further, adding unique new abilities which make the ranger even more fun to play. I love these brews, but I have sought out to create a ranger that envelopes the ideas of the original ranger and simply allows them to be more verstaile. The ranger is cunning, adaptable, and provides useful insight to the rest of the party - and I think these changes go a long way towards allowing you to live that fantasy.": "看到游侠的独特身份，许多人想出了一些伟大的想法，进一步充实了这个身份，增加了独特的新能力，使游侠玩起来更加有趣。我喜欢这些构思，但我想创造一个游侠，它包含了原始游侠的想法，并简单地让它们变得更加真实。游侠是狡猾的、适应性强的，并能为党的其他成员提供有用的洞察力--我认为这些变化对让你实现这种幻想有很大的帮助。",
	"These changes do make this ranger somewhat more powerful  than its base - the PHB ranger. The most impactful and flavor- neutral changes here are the ones to hunter's mark and the ranger  spells. If you find this ranger to be too powerful for your campaign, I would first revert the spell changes before trying anything else.": "这些变化确实使这个游侠比它的基础--PHB游侠--更强大。最有影响的和不偏不倚的改动是对猎人的标记和游侠的法术的改动。如果你觉得这个游侠对你的活动来说太强大了，我会在尝试其他东西之前首先恢复法术的改变。",
	"When I look at the ranger, I see a small list of fundamental issues. None of these have to do with the ranger's identity; they are all mechanical stumbling blocks that make the ranger hard to use. The problems I sought to fix when writing this brew are as follows:": "当我看到游侠时，我看到了一小串基本问题。这些都与游侠的身份无关；它们都是使游侠难以使用的机械绊脚石。我在写这篇文的时候试图解决的问题如下。",
	"The ranger should be a skilled tracker and hunter. Their profession, and sometimes passion, lies in keeping the outskirts of civilization safe. It is also mentioned that they can often travel between civilizations, experiencing vastly different enemies and terrains. Why, then, do rangers turn a blind eye to all but one type of enemy and terrain? Shouldn't they adapt to each situation presented faster than anyone else?": "护林员应该是一个熟练的追踪者和猎手。他们的职业，有时也是他们的热情，在于维护文明郊区的安全。还提到，他们经常可以在不同的文明之间旅行，经历截然不同的敌人和地形。那么，为什么游骑兵对所有的敌人和地形都视而不见，只有一种类型？他们不是应该比其他人更快地适应所呈现的每一种情况吗？",
	"Rangers' offense is often relegated to debuff-attack, without much variety. This is because their spellcasting ability and many of their spells are heavily limited, and I believe this is intended to offset their combined ranged and tracking capabilities. However, in play, this leaves them a set of dull options that are almost entirely prevented from interacting with each other. Adding new ways to use their spells, and lifting some of the constraints, helps alleviate the issues.": "游骑兵的进攻经常被归结为debuff-攻击，没有什么变化。这是因为他们的法术能力和许多法术都受到很大的限制，我相信这是为了抵消他们综合的远程和追踪能力。然而，在游戏中，这给他们留下了一套沉闷的选择，几乎完全无法相互影响。增加新的方法来使用他们的法术，并解除一些限制，有助于缓解这些问题。",
	"Their abilities are all passive. This makes them completely forgettable - as such, I've never met a ranger who remembers every passive benefit they get at all times, or a DM who can accurately account for a ranger. It also gives little incentive to role-play your class. Many people can compensate for this with clever character background, but a ranger's class is far less ingrained into the character's persona than, say, a druid or a paladin would be. You should feel like nobody can hide from you because of your skills, not simply be granted said skills without the satisfaction of earning them.": "他们的能力都是被动的。这使得他们完全可以被遗忘--因此，我从来没有见过一个游侠能一直记得他们得到的每一个被动的好处，也没有见过一个DM能准确地说明游侠的情况。这也让人没有动力去扮演你的等级。很多人可以通过巧妙的角色背景来弥补这一点，但是游侠的等级远不如德鲁伊或圣骑士那样深入角色的内心。你应该感觉到没有人能因为你的技能而躲避你，而不是简单地被授予上述技能而没有获得它们的满足感。",
	"A few other changes here can be applied to other classes and were merely a liberty. The spell {@spell healing spirit|AdaptiveRanger} has been nerfed to a level I feel comfortable with. You can also use the changes to Ranger's spells known with many different kinds of homebrew rangers, as well as the PHB and Revised rangers. The overhaul to the Beast Master archetype should work with any version of the Ranger out there. There may be other changes like these in the document, but these are the easiest to adapt to almost any game.": "这里的其他一些变化可以适用于其他等级，只是一种自由。法术（%0%）已经被削弱到了我觉得合适的程度。你也可以用许多不同种类的自制游侠，以及PHB和修订版的游侠来使用游侠的法术变化。对野兽大师原型的大修应该适用于任何版本的游侠。文件中可能还有其他类似的修改，但这些是最容易适应几乎所有游戏的。",

	"You have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks related to tracking a creature you've marked for hunting, and while you are within 30 feet of it, you know the creature's location as long as the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. You can have only one creature marked at a time; if you mark another creature, your mark is removed from the previously marked target.": "你在追踪被你标记为狩猎的生物时，在智力和智慧检查上有优势，当你在它的30英尺范围内时，只要该生物没有被你隐藏，并且你没有失明或失聪，你就知道该生物的位置。你一次只能标记一个生物；如果你标记另一个生物，你的标记就会从之前标记的目标身上移走。",
