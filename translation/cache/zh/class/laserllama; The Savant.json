	"The slender elf cleaned her glasses with the corner of her cloak as the dust settled around her. Her benefactor had paid her a large sum to locate this forgotten place, and after weeks of pouring over ancient maps, she had pieced together the location of the temple. Now, she had a decision to make. If she reported the location of the temple to her benefactor, it would be ruthlessly stripped of valuables. But, if she kept the location hidden, she could preserve the long forgotten knowledge contained within. For to a savant, knowledge is more precious than any sum of gold.": "纤细的精灵用斗篷的一角擦拭着她的眼镜，因为她周围的灰尘已经落定。她的恩人付给她一大笔钱，让她找到这个被遗忘的地方，在翻阅了几周的古代地图之后，她已经把神庙的位置拼凑了出来。现在，她有一个决定要做。如果她向她的恩人报告寺庙的位置，它的贵重物品将被无情地剥夺。但是，如果她把位置藏起来，她就可以保留其中包含的被遗忘已久的知识。因为对一个知识分子来说，知识比任何黄金都要珍贵。",
	"The aging human warrior silently assessed the soldiers under his command. They were exhausted and almost out of supplies. It was the tenth day of the siege, and the graying warrior knew that no reinforcements were coming to their rescue. He was too old to be of much use in battle, but if his soldiers followed his orders without hesitation, they might have a chance of survival. He stood up, and for what could be the last time, he tightened his belt and drew his sword.": "这位年迈的人类战士默默地评估着他麾下的士兵。他们已经筋疲力尽，几乎没有补给了。这是围困的第十天，这位白发苍苍的战士知道，没有援军会来救他们。他太老了，在战斗中没有什么用处，但如果他的士兵毫不犹豫地听从他的命令，他们可能会有生存的机会。他站了起来，这可能是最后一次，他紧了紧腰带，拔出了他的剑。",
	"A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands shook as he examined his brother's wounds. His clan had spent a small fortune sending him to study at the finest university in the land. All the hours spent in lectures and libraries, all for this moment. He thought back to his lessons and began to dress his brother's wounds.": "一个年轻的矮人在战斗中俯身于他昏迷的战友，他的手在检查他兄弟的伤口时颤抖。他的家族花了一笔小钱把他送到这片土地上最好的大学去学习。所有花在讲座和图书馆的时间，都是为了这一刻。他回想着自己的课程，开始为他哥哥包扎伤口。",
	"There are many wonderfully intelligent people in the world, but few are true savants. Born with the innate desire to learn anything they can, and the potential for genius-level intellect, savants spend their lives learning anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognizable at an early age, a savant's unquenchable hunger for knowledge draws them to the great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. They are willing to go to any lengths to unlock the secrets of the world, often turning to lives of adventure. For a savant, no price is too steep for the promise of discovery.": "世界上有许多聪明绝顶的人，但很少有人是真正的救世主。天生就有学习任何东西的欲望，并具有天才级智力的潜力，救世主一生都在学习他们周围人愿意教的任何东西。通常在很小的时候就能辨认出来，救世主对知识的无止境的渴望吸引他们去伟大的图书馆、大学和其他高等教育场所。他们愿意不惜一切代价来解开世界的秘密，往往转向冒险的生活。对于知识分子来说，为了探索的承诺，没有什么代价是太沉重的。",

To them, their desire for knowledge is more important than loyalty to any ideology.": "萨瓦特人非常专注于他们所选择的研究领域，并经常痴迷于学习有关他们专业的一切。在寻求发现的过程中，救世主愿意抛开任何信念，包括政治、宗教或其他方面的信念，来获取他们所寻求的信息。对他们来说，他们对知识的渴望比对任何意识形态的忠诚更重要。",
	"Often at great cost, savants will continue researching until they have made an indelible mark on their area of study.": "往往要付出巨大的代价，救世主们会继续研究，直到他们在自己的研究领域打下不可磨灭的烙印。",

Were they the star pupil of the finest university in the land, or did they come from poverty, fighting for any scrap of knowledge they could get their hands on?": "在创造救世主时，要考虑他们的成长经历和正规教育的水平。他们是这片土地上最好的大学的明星学生，还是来自贫困，为任何他们能得到的知识碎片而奋斗？",
	"Also, consider why your savant relies only on their intellect, rather than the arcane or the patronage of a higher power.": "此外，还要考虑为什么你的救世主只依赖他们的智力，而不是奥秘或更高力量的庇护。",
	"Finally, why did they become an adventurer rather than an academic? Have they advanced beyond study and now look forward to the endless discoveries of a life of adventure?": "最后，他们为什么会成为一个冒险家而不是一个学者？他们是否已经超越了学习，现在期待着冒险生活中的无尽发现？",

	"Specializing in the study of forgotten civilizations, ancient places, and uncharted lands, Archaeologists bring the light of knowledge to the dark and deadly places of the world. Doing their best to uncover the wisdom of ages long forgotten, they tend to feel a sad kinship with the civilizations they study and go to great lengths not to destroy or offend their memory. For an Archaeologist, the best way to improve the present is to learn from both the mistakes and innovations of the past.": "考古学家专门研究被遗忘的文明、古老的地方和未知的土地，他们把知识的光芒带到世界上黑暗和致命的地方。他们尽最大努力去发掘那些早已被遗忘的时代的智慧，他们往往对他们所研究的文明有一种悲哀的亲情，并不遗余力地去破坏或冒犯他们的记忆。对于一个考古学家来说，改善现在的最好方法是从过去的错误和创新中学习。",

	"The Naturalist's classroom begins at the edges of civilization. They study the natural balance of ecosystems and will go to any lengths to maintain that balance.

	"Physicians bring their considerable intellect to bear healing the sick and tending to the wounded.

Using their medical training, they offer aid to those who don't have access to the luxury of divine or arcane healing magic.": "医生利用他们相当的智力来治疗病人和照顾伤员。他们一生都在研究凡人的解剖学和内部运作，并利用他们的知识使盟友保持最佳状态。利用他们的医学训练，他们为那些无法获得神圣或神秘的治疗魔法的人提供帮助。",
	"Most successful monarchs, conquerors, and revolutions have a master strategist that is responsible for their success on the battlefield. Known as Tacticians, these intelligent leaders are always one step ahead of their enemies and strive to have a plan for every eventuality.
