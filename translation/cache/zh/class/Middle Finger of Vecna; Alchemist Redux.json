	"An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.": "炼金炸弹是一个1磅重、苹果大小的球形玻璃或粘土烧瓶，里面装满了反应性化学品。一个装有试剂的较小的薄玻璃瓶悬浮在液体中，整个瓶子用软木塞或蜡封密封。化学品在混合后会发生剧烈爆炸。这发生在内瓶破裂时，通常是在炸弹撞击固体表面或导火线引爆小瓶内的小型炸药雷管之后。炸弹主要用于抵御敌人，但有创造力的炼金术士可能会为炸药找到更实用的用途，如拆除障碍物。",

	"The primary source of alchemy's power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements.
