	"Standing outside the gaping maw of a cavern entrance you hear a booming echo of an older man sound from within the cave's depths, \"Hey! You! Yeah you sleeping worm! Wake up! It's time for dinner!\"": "你站在洞穴入口的缺口外，听到洞穴深处传来一个年长者的轰鸣回声：\"嘿！你！你！你！\"。是的，你这只沉睡的虫子! 醒醒吧! 该吃晚饭了！\"",
	"The cave then shakes with a deafening roar while emanating a soft orange glow from deep within. The sound stops, and the light fades once more to darkness. Suddenly you see emerge before you sprinting out of the cave's mouth, with blue cape still aflame and flapping in the wind, is the man you had heard taunting mere moments ago. He is a short human, seeming to be well over the age of fifty, with a face that is a pure mixture of equal parts amusement and mischief. The man notices you and manages to choke out mid sprint, \"Best be on your way!\" He coughs twice, a puff of black smoke escaping each time.": "然后，山洞发出震耳欲聋的吼声，同时从深处发出柔和的橙色光芒。声音停止了，光芒再次消逝，变成了黑暗。突然，你看到你面前出现了一个从洞口冲刺出来的人，他的蓝色斗篷仍然燃烧着，在风中拍打着，就是你刚才听到嘲弄的那个人。他是一个矮小的人类，似乎已经超过了50岁，脸上是一种纯粹的混合乐趣和恶作剧。这个人注意到了你，并在冲刺过程中哽咽着说：\"最好在路上！\" 他咳嗽了两声，每次都冒出一股黑烟。",
	"He stops before your feet and dusts himself off along with squelching the flames behind him, before he continues on to say, \"Dragons are not to be fooled around with,...\" Another cough, another black wisp.": "他在你的脚前停了下来，掸了掸身上的灰尘，同时压灭了身后的火焰，然后他继续说：\"龙是不能被愚弄的，...\" 又是一声咳嗽，又是一缕黑雾。",
	"He chuckles and looks up at you with a childish grin, full of satisfaction,  \"... nothing worse in this world than their hot, stinky breath.\"": "他笑了笑，抬头看着你，露出孩子气的笑容，充满了满足感。\"......这个世界上没有什么比他们的热气、臭气更糟糕的了。\"",
	"With those final words, the man wanders off, as if nothing extraordinary had just transpired, and you are left there alone to choose the path that you will follow.": "说完这些话，这个人就走了，好像刚才没有什么特别的事情发生，而你就被单独留在那里，选择你要走的路。",
	"There are many tales regarding the first blue traveler, some of which paint him as a hero whom wandered the world fighting monsters with their own power. Other tales say he was a sailor of sorts who was known by every barwench in every brothel across the seas. Many speak of his courage, his willingness to walk alone into the darkest dungeons, and his uncanny knack for making it out alive. It is believed by most that this man went by the name of Fharlanghn, the God of Roads, horizons and travelling.": "关于第一个蓝色旅行者有许多传说，其中一些将他描绘成一个英雄，在世界范围内游荡，用自己的力量与怪物战斗。其他故事说他是个水手，被大洋彼岸每家妓院的每个酒吧女郎所认识。许多人谈到他的勇气，他愿意独自走进最黑暗的地牢，以及他能活着出来的不可思议的诀窍。大多数人认为，这个人的名字叫Fharlanghn，是道路、视野和旅行之神。",
	"Whether it be for their own desires, or a pilgrimage of sorts for those who wish to pay homage to Fharlanghn, blue travelers take to the road in honor of these tales of adventure and exploration. It is for these reasons that they are treated like clerics in a way when visiting a shrine to Fharlanghn, which can be found at most crossroads and oases.": "无论是为了自己的愿望，还是为了那些希望向Fharlanghn致敬的人的朝圣之旅，蓝色的旅行者们走上了道路，以纪念这些冒险和探险的故事。正是由于这些原因，在某种程度上，他们在拜访法蓝恩的神龛时被当作神职人员对待，在大多数十字路口和绿洲都能找到。",
	"Blue travelers take the term \"adaptive learner\" to an entirely new level. They are mages who have mastered the art of using magic to \"mimic\" the spells and special actions that have struck them. Be it the humble cure wounds spell or even the fiery breath of a dragon, these travelers have learned how to copy them all. As long as they're willing to stand in the face of peril, the blue travelers repertoire will continue to grow. In pursuit of this growth the traveler must seek dangerous foes, thus creating a cycle by which a life full of memorable experiences is fabricated.": "蓝色旅行者将 \"适应性学习者 \"一词提升到一个全新的水平。他们是掌握了使用魔法来 \"模仿 \"击中他们的法术和特殊行为的法师。无论是简陋的治愈伤口咒语，甚至是龙的火热气息，这些旅行者都学会了如何复制它们。只要他们愿意站在危险面前，蓝色旅行者的剧目就会继续增长。为了追求这种成长，旅行者必须寻找危险的敌人，从而创造出一个循环，通过这个循环制造出充满难忘经历的生活。",
	"Many during their traveles tend to train in basic melee combat, which caters to their up-close and personal style. While others on the contrary prefer a life dedicated to knowledge, these travelers forgo their martial training in exchange for greater spellcasting abilities. There are even quiet rumors of gun-bearing, blue-coat wearing, seafarers who sail under flags marked with the holy symbol of Fharlanghn.": "许多人在旅行中倾向于训练基本的近战，这迎合了他们近距离的个人风格。而另一些人则相反，他们更喜欢致力于知识的生活，这些旅行者放弃了他们的武术训练，以换取更大的法术能力。甚至有悄悄的传言说，有一些持枪、穿蓝衣的海员在标有Fharlanghn神圣标志的旗帜下航行。",
	"Usually blue travelers are lone wanderers, they prefer it that way so as to not jeopardize others for their own desires. However, every once in a blue moon a traveler may happen across a bard whom they will travel alongside of due to common interests and appreciation for eachothers crafts. Besides this most of the time a blue traveler finds themself with a group of fellow adventurers through happenstance like being thrust into battle alongside them, or being hired for a job requiring multiple adventurers. No matter how it happens, any group who shares the love for adventure that a blue traveler has will likely welcome a blue traveler on account of the carefree, joyous atmosphere they tend to emanate, and their abundance of knowledge about the world and it's dangers that they bring to the table.": "通常，蓝色的旅行者都是孤独的流浪者，他们喜欢这样，以免为了自己的欲望而危害他人。然而，每隔一段时间，旅行者可能会碰上一个吟游诗人，由于共同的兴趣和对彼此手艺的欣赏，他们会和他一起旅行。除此之外，大多数时候，一个蓝色的旅行者发现自己与一群冒险家同伴在一起是由于偶然的原因，比如被推入战场，或者被雇用做一项需要多个冒险家的工作。不管是如何发生的，任何与蓝调旅行者一样热爱冒险的团体都会欢迎蓝调旅行者，因为他们往往散发着无忧无虑的快乐气氛，以及他们带来的关于世界和危险的丰富知识。",
	"The first thing you have to do when making a blue traveler is consult with your DM on whether the travelers guild, the deity Fharlanghn, or firearms, have a place in the world they have created. If they do not, it's not such a big deal, the class is still playable in every way, it will just be lacking a bit in the lore department,  and the gun mage path will be unavailable without firearms. If your DM is open to adding these things to his world but needs inspiration or information regarding them he can see the wiki page on Fharlanghn <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fharlanghn>here</a>.": "The first thing you have to do when making a blue traveler is consult with your DM on whether the travelers guild, the deity Fharlanghn, or firearms, have a place in the world they have created.

	"The travelers guild is a guild dedicated to a few things, first and foremost it is hearth and home to any traveler who walks through its doors. The guilds second duty is dedication to mapping every nook and cranny of the realm, keeping note on important discoveries and locations, and keeping them secret if deemed necessary. Thirdly, it is a place of buisness where blue travelers can go to set up shop and sell any wares they have found in their explorations, this business works well because there will always be another traveler present who is in need. Last, but certainly not least, it is a place of reverance for the deity Fharlanghn.": "旅行者公会是一个致力于几件事的公会，首先，它是任何走过它的门的旅行者的炉灶和家。行会的第二个职责是致力于绘制王国的每一个角落，记录重要的发现和地点，并在认为必要时对其进行保密。第三，它是一个商业场所，蓝色的旅行者可以去那里开店，出售他们在探索中发现的任何物品，这种生意很好做，因为总会有另一个旅行者需要。最后，但肯定不是最不重要的，它是敬仰神灵法尔兰恩的地方。",
	"The guild also serves lesser purposes such as being a gathering place for storytellers, or where travelers can practice pedagogy amongst their peers.": "公会也有一些较小的作用，比如作为讲故事的人的聚会场所，或者旅行者可以在他们的同行中练习教育学。",
	"Seeing how there are so many functions the guild serves, and how open it's doors are, the travelers guild building tends to always be quite large in size, having to accommodate so many.": "看到公会有如此多的功能，以及它的大门是如此开放，旅行者公会的建筑往往总是相当大的规模，不得不容纳这么多的人。",
	"At the entrance to every guild is a clerk, when a traveler comes seeking housing, the clerk always asks one simple question, \"From where have you come?\" The grade of the room is decided by the answer given, the greater the distance, the greater the luxuries of the room provided. No matter what, the fee is always the same, whatever you can afford.": "在每个行会的入口处都有一个办事员，当一个旅行者来寻求住房时，办事员总是问一个简单的问题：\"你从哪里来？\" 房间的等级由给出的答案决定，距离越远，提供的房间就越豪华。无论怎样，费用总是一样的，只要你能负担得起。",
	"If you are starting at a level greater than 1, you should ask your DM to assign you some starting spells or special actions so you are not a blank slate.": "如果你的起始等级大于1，你应该要求你的DM为你分配一些起始法术或特殊行动，这样你就不会是一张白纸。",
	"You can make a blue traveler quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score. Make Constitution your next-highest ability score and make either Dexterity or Strength your third highest depending on your weapon of choice. Second, choose one of the following backgrounds; {@background Guild Artisan}, {@background Outlander}, {@background Sage}, {@background Sailor}, or make one of your own by following the rules set on {@b page 125} of the {@b PHB} under {@b Customizing a Background}.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名蓝色旅行者。首先，智力应该是你的最高能力得分。根据你选择的武器，将体能作为你的第二高能力得分，将灵巧或力量作为你的第三高能力得分。第二，选择以下背景之一：{@background Guild Artisan}、{@background Outlander}、{@background Sage}、{@background Sailor}，或者按照{@b Customizing a Background}下{@b PHB}的规则，自己制作一个。",
	"You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.

	"Special Action is a keyword used only in the blue traveler class. Special action refers to any action, reaction, bonus action, or legendary action that the blue traveler is capable of learning. Using this keyword in-game can alleviate the interuption in game flow that comes from not knowing which actions are special actions. For instance, when a creature attempts to use a learnable action, the DM can simply announce, \"The dragon uses its special: action, reaction, legendary action, etc, to use fire breath.\" So without needing to ask, the blue traveler will know if he can learn the action or not.": "特殊行动是一个只在蓝色旅行者等级中使用的关键词。特别行动指的是蓝色旅行者能够学习的任何行动、反应、奖励行动或传说中的行动。在游戏中使用这个关键词可以缓解因不知道哪些动作是特殊动作而导致的游戏流程中断。例如，当一个生物试图使用一个可学习的行动时，DM可以简单地宣布：\"龙使用它的特殊：行动、反应、传说中的行动等等，来使用喷火。\" 因此，不需要问，蓝色旅行者就会知道他是否可以学习这个动作。",

Instead you make an Intelligence saving throw against the casters/users save DC (If the spell or special action has no DC, it is up to the DM to create a fitting one). If you fail you can not attempt to learn the same spell or special action until you have taken a long rest. If you succeed you still take the full effect of the spell or learnable special action, but you can add it to your list of known spells or special actions.": "一级时，你获得了神奇地学习和重现成功击中你的特殊动作和法术的能力。但为了使之发挥作用，你必须自愿接受打击，并拒绝任何否定其效果的企图。当你被一个敌人的法术或可学习的特殊动作作为目标或处于其区域效应中时，你可以选择失败任何相关的蓄力，并将你的攻击力降低到0。相反，你可以对施法者/使用者的救赎DC进行智力救赎（如果该法术或特殊动作没有DC，则由DM创造一个合适的DC）。如果你失败了，你就不能再尝试学习相同的法术或特殊动作，直到你休息了很长时间。如果你成功了，你仍然会接受该法术或可学习的特殊动作的全部效果，但你可以把它加入你的已知法术或特殊动作列表。",
	"Learned special actions can only be actions, bonus actions, reactions, or legendary actions. They cannot be listed as a Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack. And they must directly target, or include the blue traveler in it's area of effect. Foe abilities that cast a spell are treated as spells for the purpose of learning. Blue travelers can learn spells of a higher level than they can cast, but they won't be useable until they can cast spells of that level, however they cannot learn spells that require a ritual as they cannot cast rituals. Learned legendary actions are used by spending a normal action, no matter what the cost of using it was to the original creature.": "学习的特殊行动只能是行动、奖励行动、反应或传奇行动。它们不能被列为近战或远程武器攻击。而且它们必须直接以蓝衣旅人为目标，或者将蓝衣旅人包括在它的作用范围内。为了学习的目的，施放法术的敌方能力被视为法术。蓝色旅行者可以学习比他们能施放的等级更高的法术，但在他们能施放该等级的法术之前，这些法术是无法使用的，然而他们不能学习需要仪式的法术，因为他们不能施放仪式。学习的传奇行动是通过花费一个正常的行动来使用的，不管使用它对原始生物的代价是什么。",
	"If a special action you are attempting to learn has a multiple choice of effects (such as a beholder's Eye Ray), you can only learn the effect you were hit by. Following with the same example, even though a creature such as the beholder can make three attacks with an Eye Ray using a single action, you may only make one. (In very niche situations where an special action would seem weak without making multiple attacks, your DM may rule otherwise.)": "如果你试图学习的特殊动作有多种效果可供选择（比如说看守者的眼睛射线），你只能学习你被击中的那个效果。按照同样的例子，即使像看守者这样的生物可以用一个动作用眼射线进行三次攻击，你也只能进行一次。(在非常小众的情况下，如果不进行多次攻击，一个特殊动作就会显得很弱，你的管理员可能会有不同的规定）。",
	"The process of learning from experience happens between the time when damage is dealt and before any conditions are applied, so if a spell or special action were to attempt to inflict a condition (such as unconscious, petrified, charmed, etc.), and you are able to recover from said condition, you will do so having learned the spell or special action if you succeeded on your learning attempt.": "从经验中学习的过程发生在伤害发生的时间和任何条件被应用之前，所以如果一个法术或特殊动作试图施加一个条件（如昏迷、石化、迷惑等），而你能够从上述条件中恢复过来，如果你的学习尝试成功，你将在学习了该法术或特殊动作之后这样做。",

	"You have spell memory that expands depending on your level. The Blue Traveler table shows how much memory you have with which you can fill by learning spells. You can unlearn any spell you have learned before to free up space but must learn the spell by getting hit by it all over again if you do. Consigning a spell to oblivion is a severely stressfull task that requires 1 hour per forgotten spell, during this hour you are under severe mental strain and are unable to rest.": "你拥有的法术记忆会根据你的等级而扩展。蓝色旅行者表显示了你有多少记忆，你可以通过学习法术来填充。你可以解除你之前学过的任何法术以释放空间，但如果你这样做，就必须通过重新被它击中来学习法术。将法术遗忘是一项严重的压力任务，每个被遗忘的法术需要1小时，在这1小时内，你会受到严重的精神压力，无法休息。",
	"The Blue Traveler table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your mimicked spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell {@spell thunderwave|PHB}, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.": "蓝色旅行者表显示你有多少个法术槽。该表还显示了这些法术槽的等级；你所有的法术槽都是一样的等级。要施展你的一个1级或以上的模仿法术，你必须消耗一个法术槽。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。例如，当你5级的时候，你有两个3级的法术槽。为了施放1级法术（%0%），你必须花费其中一个法术槽，并且你将其作为3级法术施放。",
	"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your blue traveler, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blue traveler spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的蓝色旅行者的法术能力，所以每当一个法术提到你的法术能力时，你都会使用你的智力。此外，在设定你所施展的蓝色旅行者法术的蓄力DC时，以及在使用蓝色旅行者法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的智力修改器。",
	"You can use an {@item arcane focus|PHB} (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your blue traveler spells.": "你可以使用一个（%0%）（在第五章中找到）作为你的蓝色旅行者法术的施法重点。",
	"Using your mimicry magic you are able to mirror the effects of other creatures special actions much like casting any other spell.
