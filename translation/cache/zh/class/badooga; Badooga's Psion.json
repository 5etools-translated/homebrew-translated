	"A human clad in simple robes walks along a forest path. A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion's slave pens. Their smiles turn to shrieks of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly cudgel.": "一个身着简单长袍的人类沿着林间小路走着。一群地精从灌木丛中走出来，用箭瞄准他，他们为自己能找到如此容易的猎物而笑得合不拢嘴，为军团的奴隶栏而笑得很开心。他们的笑容变成了恐怖的尖叫，因为这个旅行者长成了巨人，向他们跃去，他的法杖现在成了致命的棍棒。",
	"The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs' charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity. Suddenly, mindless fear clings to the orcs' minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run, never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.": "民兵们排成队伍，准备迎接兽人的冲锋。咆哮的野蛮人嚎叫着发出战斗的呐喊，向前猛冲。令他们惊讶的是，人类的乌合之众坚守阵地，以惊人的凶猛战斗。突然间，无意识的恐惧笼罩着兽人的头脑，尽管他们面对的是一个远不如他们的敌人，但他们转身就跑，从未注意到站在民兵中间指挥他们工作的冷静半精灵。",
	"Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When the duke's men arrived to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.": "冯-路德维希男爵一直为他的大图书馆感到骄傲。他不知道，每天晚上，一个满载空白卷轴的地精都会从他的卫兵身边溜走，尽职尽责地抄写他最严密的档案。当公爵的人来到这里，以对付恶魔为由逮捕他时，他从未猜到与他们同行的地精文士在过去一年里在他的守卫中度过的时间比他还多。",
	"These heroes are all psions, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Psions shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Psions are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.": "这些英雄都是幻术师，是一种奇怪而神秘的力量形式的追随者。幻术师避开世界，将目光转向内部，掌握他们思想的全部潜力，在转向面对世界之前探索他们的心灵。幻术师是非常罕见的，大多数人宁愿对他们能力的性质保密。利用他们内在的精神力量，他们可以读心，淡化隐形，将他们的身体变成活生生的铁，并夺取对物理世界的控制权，使其服从自己的意愿。",
	"Psions are loners. Most discover the secrets of their power through vague references in tomes of lore or by ingratiating themselves to a master of the power.": "幻术师是独行侠。大多数人通过传说书中模糊的参考资料或通过与力量大师的交好来发现他们力量的秘密。",
	"In order to master their power, psions must first master themselves. They spend months and years in quiet contemplation, exploring their minds and leaving nothing uncovered. During this time, they shun society and typically live as hermits at the edge of society. A psion who studied under a master worked as a virtual slave, toiling away at mundane tasks in return for the occasional lesson or cryptic insight.": "为了掌握他们的力量，幻术师必须首先掌握自己。他们花数月或数年时间安静地沉思，探索自己的思想，不放过任何蛛丝马迹。在这段时间里，他们回避社会，通常作为隐士生活在社会的边缘。在大师手下学习的幻术师就像一个虚拟的奴隶，在世俗的任务中辛勤工作，以换取偶尔的教训或隐秘的见解。",
	"When psions finally master their power, they return to the world to broaden their horizons and practice their craft. Some psions prefer to remain isolated, but those who become adventurers aren't content to remain on the fringe of the world.": "当幻术师最终掌握了他们的力量，他们就会回到这个世界上，扩大他们的视野，练习他们的技艺。有些幻术师喜欢与世隔绝，但那些成为冒险家的幻术师并不满足于停留在世界的边缘地带。",
	"In order to maintain the strict discipline and intense self-knowledge needed to tap into their power, psions develop a variety of practices to keep their focus sharp. These practices are reflected in taboos and quirks, strange little behaviors that govern a psion's actions.": "为了保持严格的纪律和强烈的自知之明，以挖掘他们的力量，幻术师发展出各种做法，以保持他们的注意力。这些做法反映在禁忌和怪癖上，这些怪异的小行为支配着灵媒的行动。",
	"These quirks are oaths or behavioral tics that help keep psions in the proper frame of mind while maintaining perfect control over their minds and bodies. While these taboos are harmless, they help cast psions as outsiders. Few feel accepted by society, and fewer still care to become integrated with it. To psions, the life of the mind is where they feel most at home.": "这些怪癖是誓言或行为上的抽搐，有助于使幻术师保持适当的心态，同时保持对他们身心的完美控制。虽然这些禁忌是无害的，但它们有助于使幻术师成为局外人。很少有人觉得自己被社会所接受，更少有人愿意与社会融合。对幻觉者来说，心灵的生活是他们感到最自在的地方。",
	"To add some texture to your psion, consider the quirks your character has acquired. They're a great roleplaying tool to add character to the game. You can roll on or pick from the table below, or create your own quirks. Aim to create two quirks, to give them more of a chance to come into play. Finally, consider why your character chose these behaviors. What do they say about your character's personality or background? Are they based on a specific incident or a belief?": "为了给你的幻术增加一些质感，考虑你的角色所获得的怪癖。它们是一个很好的角色扮演工具，可以在游戏中增加角色。你可以在下面的表格中滚动或挑选，或者创造你自己的怪癖。争取创造两个怪癖，让它们有更多机会发挥作用。最后，考虑你的角色为什么选择这些行为。它们对你的角色的个性或背景有什么说明？它们是基于一个具体的事件或一个信念吗？",

	"While the specifics of a display may be left up to the player (with the approval of the DM), they always allow the psionicist to be identified as the source of a psionic discipline (as it is with spell components), both during and after the discipline takes effect.": "虽然展示的具体细节可以由玩家决定（经DM批准），但它们总是允许幻术师被识别为幻术纪律的来源（就像它与法术组件一样），无论是在纪律生效期间还是之后。",
	"When a discipline or talent has you cast a spell (including a cantrip), the spell uses your discipline attack modifier or discipline save DC. Additionally, the effect counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. However, your casting of the spell is not actually considered to be a magical effect. You are merely duplicating the effect of the spell with your mind; as such, the spell uses a display instead of its normal components, and the effect counts as a psionic effect and not a spell for the purpose of resolving effects like {@spell antimagic field} and {@spell counterspell}.": "当一个学科或天赋让你施展法术（包括咒语）时，该法术使用你的学科攻击修饰或学科救赎DC。此外，为了克服对非魔法攻击和伤害的抵抗和免疫，该效果也算作魔法。然而，你的施法实际上并不被认为是一种魔法效果。你只是用你的意念复制了该咒语的效果；因此，该咒语使用了一个显示，而不是它的正常成分，并且该效果算作是一个幻术效果，而不是为了解决像（%0%）和（%1%）这样的效果的目的的咒语。",
	"An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.": "一个学科中的效果选项规定了其效果持续的时间。",
	"If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.": "如果没有指定持续时间，该选项的效果是瞬时的。",
	"Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with \"conc.\" after the option's psi point cost. The \"conc.\" notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says \"conc., 1 min.,\" you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute.": "有些选项需要集中精力来维持其效果。这种要求在选项的psi点成本之后用 \"conc. \"来表示。Conc. \"后面是浓缩的最大持续时间。例如，如果一个选项上写着 \"集中，1分钟\"，那么你可以集中其效果长达1分钟。",
	"Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See {@book chapter 10|PHB|10}, \"Spellcasting,\" in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.": "专注于一个学科的规则与专注于一个法术的规则相同。这个规则意味着你不能同时专注于一个咒语和一个修行，也不能同时专注于两个修行。关于集中精力的工作原理，请参见《玩家手册》中的（%0%），\"施法\"。",
	"Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as presented in {@book chapter 10|PHB|10}, \"Spellcasting,\" of the Player's Handbook.": "幻术学科使用与法术相同的规则来确定目标和效果区域，如《玩家手册》的（%0%），\"咒语 \"所述。",
	"If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.": "如果一项纪律要求救赎，它规定了救赎的类型以及救赎成功或失败的结果。蓄力是由你的幻术能力决定的。",
	"Some disciplines require you to make a psychic attack to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability, and is the same as a ranged spell attack for the purpose of other game effects.": "有些纪律要求你进行精神攻击，以确定该纪律的效果是否击中目标。攻击卷使用的是你的幻象能力，就其他游戏效果而言，与远程法术攻击是一样的。",
	"The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect—applies while the durations of the effects overlap.": "不同幻术的效果相加，而这些幻术的持续时间也会重叠。同样地，如果一个幻术学科的不同选项同时激活，它们也会合并。然而，如果一个幻术学科的特定选项被多次使用，则该选项不会与自身结合。相反，最有力的效果--通常取决于有多少psi点被用来创造效果--会在效果的持续时间重叠的时候适用。",
	"Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap.": "幻术和法术是独立的效果，因此它们的好处和坏处是重叠的。",
	"In many settings, psionics is a special form of magic use. In such a setting, psionics still isn't considered spellcasting (except in cases where it duplicates a spell effect), but a psionic power counts as a magical effect for the purpose of game effects like {@spell antimagic field} and {@spell detect magic}, as well as for monster traits like Magic Resistance. Feel free to treat psionics as a form of magic, either in flavor or just in terms of mechanics, in your games.": "在许多设定中，幻术是魔法使用的一种特殊形式。在这样的环境中，幻术仍然不被认为是法术（除了在它重复法术效果的情况下），但是对于像（%0%）和（%1%）这样的游戏效果，以及像魔法抵抗这样的怪物特性来说，幻术的力量算作是一种魔法效果。在你的游戏中，你可以自由地将幻术作为一种魔法形式来对待，无论是在风味上还是在机制上。"
