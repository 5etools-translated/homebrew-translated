	"The half-orc silently moved through the forest, her tattoos shimmering in the moonlight. Gripping the ancestral war club of her tribe, she called upon the spirits of previous champions to empower her strikes. A cold wind came over the hobgoblin camp as the half-orc walked into their midst. These raiders who had dared to take lumber from the ancestral forest of her people would not live to see the dawn.": "半兽人静静地穿过森林，她的刺青在月光下闪闪发光。握着她部落的祖传战棍，她呼唤以前的冠军的灵魂来增强她的攻击力。当半兽人走到地精营地时，一阵冷风吹来，在他们中间。这些敢于从她的族人的祖先森林中夺取木材的突袭者将无法活着看到黎明的到来。",
	"The hunched-over, elderly halfling clung to his walking stick as the massive ogre came barreling toward him. Just before the monster fell upon him, the elder embraced the spirit of the Great Beast and shapeshifted into a supernaturally massive bear. The two collided with thunderous force, but only one would survive. The eyes of the great bear flashed with a momentary green light and as suddenly as it had appeared, an elderly halfling stood in its place, his eyes glowing with green light.": "当巨大的食人魔向他冲来时，这个驼背的半身人老人紧紧抓住他的手杖。就在怪物扑向他之前，这位长者拥抱了巨兽的精神，变身为一只超自然的巨熊。两者以雷霆万钧之势相撞，但只有一个人能活下来。大熊的眼睛闪着瞬间的绿光，就像它突然出现一样，一个年长的半身人站在它的位置上，他的眼睛闪着绿光。",
	"The thin elf stood on a cliff overlooking the great battle below. The great dragon had all but decimated the battalion of guards that had come to defend their home. A single man stood and thrust his spear toward the terrifying wyrm, but before the dragon could deflect the blow, the elf unleashed a powerful spirit from within one of her Totems. In an instant, the spirit had enveloped the dragon, temporarily sapping its strength. In its weakened state, the spear pierced the great beast's heart, ending its campaign of terror. The elf made her way back to her solitary cave, content knowing that the town she guarded in secret would be safe for another season.": "瘦小的精灵站在悬崖上俯瞰下面的大战。大龙已经完全消灭了前来保卫家园的一营卫兵。一个人站起来，将他的长矛刺向可怕的巨龙，但在巨龙能够抵挡这一击之前，精灵从她的一个图腾中释放了一个强大的精神。在一瞬间，这种精神笼罩了巨龙，暂时削弱了它的力量。在它虚弱的状态下，长矛刺穿了巨兽的心脏，结束了它的恐怖活动。小精灵回到了她那孤独的山洞，她知道她秘密守护的小镇在下一个季节将是安全的。",
	"The three characters above are examples of the spiritual conduits known as shamans. Using ancient knowledge they are able to bind and channel the power of primal spirits.": "上面的三个人物是被称为萨满的精神通道的例子。他们利用古老的知识，能够束缚和引导原始精神的力量。",
	"Before the gods took notice of mortals and bestowed power upon clerics and paladins, shamans served as protectors and guides. Using supernatural techniques, shamans were able to bind spirits to Totems, small objects of spiritual significance, and channel that power for good of their people. Passed from elder to elder in a continuous chain, those who learn the arts of shamanism are part of a truly ancient spiritual tradition.": "在诸神注意到凡人并赋予牧师和圣骑士权力之前，萨满充当保护者和向导。利用超自然的技术，巫师能够将精神与图腾（具有精神意义的小物品）结合起来，并将这种力量用于为他们的人民造福。在一个连续的链条中，从长者传到长者，那些学习萨满教艺术的人是一个真正古老的精神传统的一部分。",

They are trained to recognize the spirits that dwell in every living thing and use this spiritual sight to protect those they love from sinister spirits who seek to destroy all life.": "巫师一生都在维持物质的凡人世界和虚无的精神世界之间的微妙平衡。他们被训练成能够识别居住在每个生物中的精神，并利用这种精神视力来保护他们所爱的人免受那些试图毁灭所有生命的邪恶精神的影响。",
	"Sometimes, shamans will seek out spirits of love and life that willingly bind themselves to Totems so that they may aid the shaman in their spiritual warfare. Other malevolent and vile spirits are bound to Totems against their will and used by shamans to help defeat other powerful spirits of destruction.": "有时，萨满会寻找愿意与图腾结合的爱与生命之灵，以便它们可以帮助萨满进行精神斗争。其他恶毒和卑鄙的灵魂则违背自己的意愿与图腾结合，被萨满用来帮助打败其他强大的毁灭之灵。",
	"When creating your shaman, consider how you first learned to wield the power of spirits. Were you trained from birth to become the next elder of your people, destined to inherit the power of your ancestors? Were you raised by a vile hag, and taught to manipulate spirits of darkness and death to curse and hex your foes? Or did you study under an ancient hermit, learning to draw upon the spiritual power within in all living things in order to heal the spiritually and physically broken?": "在创造你的萨满时，考虑你最初是如何学会挥舞精神力量的。你是否一出生就被训练成你的族人的下一任长老，注定要继承你祖先的力量？你是被一个卑鄙的巫婆抚养长大，并被教导操纵黑暗和死亡的灵魂来诅咒和迷惑你的敌人？或者你在一个古老的隐士手下学习，学会利用所有生物中的精神力量，以治愈精神和身体上的创伤？",
	"No matter your origin, you should decide how your shaman views the spiritual world. Have they dedicated themselves to maintaining a balance between the physical and ethereal? Or, do they view spirits as tools to be bound and used, a source of power that shamans can wield in whatever ways they choose?": "无论你的出身如何，你应该决定你的萨满如何看待精神世界。他们是否致力于维持物质与虚无之间的平衡？或者，他们是否将精神视为可以束缚和使用的工具，是萨满们可以以任何方式挥舞的力量源泉？",

Any Tiny object of your choice can be a Totem, but most often they are objects reminiscent of the spirit within.": "在1级时，你学会了将原始的自然之灵捆绑成神圣的图腾，以便你可以安全地引导它们的神秘能力。你选择的任何微小物体都可以成为图腾，但最常见的是让人联想到内在精神的物体。",
