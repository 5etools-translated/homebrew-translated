	"Blood dripping from his blade, a scarred half orc gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint, his eyes alight with bestial fury.": "血从他的刀上滴下来，一个有疤痕的半兽人四肢着地，开始冲刺，他的眼睛里闪着兽性的怒火。",
	"Advancing slowly, an elf brandishing a green scimitar emerges from the foliage before two poachers. Startled, they turn to run, but find their feet bound fast by leaves and vines.": "一个挥舞着绿色弯刀的精灵缓慢地前进，在两个偷猎者面前从树叶中出现。他们吓了一跳，转身就跑，但发现他们的脚被树叶和藤蔓紧紧捆住。",
	"Wardens are vigilant guardians, and unbreakable defenders of the weak. They are nature's shield, and the watchers of the realms of men. When the world cries out for a champion, wardens heed the call.": "守护者是警惕的守护者，是弱者牢不可破的捍卫者。他们是大自然的盾牌，也是人类领域的守望者。当世界呼唤冠军的时候，守护者会响应号召。",
	"Ever-vigilant, wardens are the staunch defenders of nature and the chosen champions of people. A warden might be selected by his tribe to defend them from their enemies, or be visited by the spirits of a sacred grove and beckoned to watch over the forest. Where a warden is not directly called to defend others, he feels the constant pull to take up a charge of his own, to use his strength as a bastion for the weak.": "警惕性极高的看守人是自然界的坚定捍卫者，也是人们所选择的冠军。一个典狱长可能被他的部落选中，以保护他们免受敌人的攻击，或者被神圣的树林的灵魂拜访，并被召唤去看守森林。如果一个典狱长没有被直接召唤去保护他人，他就会感觉到有一种持续的拉力，让他承担起自己的责任，用自己的力量为弱者提供一个堡垒。",
	"Wherever a warden travels, his strength travels with him, and new causes make themselves known. There is never a shortage on those who need protection, for the strong always seem to stand above the weak.": "无论典狱长走到哪里，他的力量都会随之而来，新的事业也会随之而来。需要保护的人永远不会少，因为强者似乎总是站在弱者之上。",

	"Wardens draw their extraordinary toughness from the wild itself. They can feel the strength of the earth beneath their feet, the vitality of the air in their lungs, and the fury of the blazing sun overhead. They channel this power intuitively, without ever considering it. Indeed, some wardens believe that their power comes from within, and that nature does nothing to empower them, but even these wardens feel nature's pull to defend the powerless and take up a cause.": "守护者从野性本身中汲取他们非凡的韧性。他们能感觉到脚下大地的力量，肺里空气的活力，以及头顶烈日的怒火。他们凭直觉引导这种力量，而从不考虑它。事实上，有些看守人认为他们的力量来自内心，自然界并没有赋予他们任何力量，但即使是这些看守人也能感受到自然界的牵引，以保护无能为力的人，并承担起一项事业。",
	"When creating a warden, consider what drives your character. What brought you to raise up your shield for others? Do you fight to protect anyone or anywhere in particular? A threat to your homeland, or loved ones, might have been your catalyst, but you also might have risen to combat a menace to the natural world. What was your call, and how do you honor it? What motivates you to keep fighting, even when you're at death's door?": "当创建一个监狱长时，考虑是什么驱动你的角色。是什么让你为他人举起你的盾牌？你是为了保护某个人或某个地方而战斗吗？对你的祖国或亲人的威胁可能是你的催化剂，但你也可能是为了打击对自然界的威胁而站起来。你的召唤是什么，你如何尊重它？是什么激励你继续战斗，即使你在死亡的边缘？",
	"Most wardens have been recognized as exemplary defenders. Perhaps, you are known as a wandering knight of the northern provinces, or perhaps you were beckoned by spirits of the forest to protect them from invaders. Who has called you, and how did you respond?": "大多数看守人都被公认为是模范的保卫者。也许，你被称为北方省份的流浪骑士，也许你是被森林的精灵召唤来保护他们免受入侵者的侵害。谁召唤了你，你又是如何回应的？",

	"A warden's call is a binding charge to protect and defend others from harm. Every warden eventually hears a call, and responds with mighty deeds. In answering this call, they embrace the traits of those they stand to protect, gaining primal, and sometimes even mystical, abilities.": "典狱长的号召是一种有约束力的指控，要保护和捍卫他人免受伤害。每个典狱长最终都会听到召唤，并以强大的行动来回应。在响应这一召唤的过程中，他们接受了他们所要保护的人的特征，获得了原始的，有时甚至是神秘的能力。",
	"The warden's unique \"tank\" role is supported entirely on its three core features: Warden's Grasp at 1st level, which lets them constrain a group of creatures to make themselves the only viable target, Warden's Mark at 2nd level, which allows them to single out a target and draw its aggression, and Warden's Resolve at 3rd level, which makes them survivable enough to use their other features with impunity. These three features define the warden's unique style, but this need not be the only style for the warden's combat. You can use the following sets of alternate class features in place of the warden's core features to entirely pivot its style of play to your preference.": "典狱长独特的 \"坦克 \"角色完全依靠其三个核心特征来支持。一级的典狱长之握可以让他们约束一群生物，使自己成为唯一可行的目标；二级的典狱长之印可以让他们单挑一个目标并吸引其攻击性；三级的典狱长之决断可以让他们有足够的生存能力来肆无忌惮地使用其他功能。这三个特征定义了典狱长的独特风格，但这不一定是典狱长战斗的唯一风格。你可以使用以下几组替代的等级特征来代替典狱长的核心特征，以完全按照你的喜好来调整其游戏风格。",
	"At 1st level, you can pick one of the following sets of alternate class features for your warden. If you do so, you use all three of the variant's features instead of Warden's Mark, Warden's Grasp, and Warden's Resolve, as well as their respective improvements at later levels. If other features directly reference these three original features or their mechanics (such as marking a creature), use their respective replacement feature instead.": "在1级的时候，你可以为你的典狱长选择以下几套备选的等级特征之一。如果你这样做了，你就会使用该变体的所有三个特征来代替典狱长的标记、典狱长的抓握和典狱长的决心，以及它们各自在以后等级的改进。如果其他特征直接引用了这三个原始特征或它们的机制（例如标记生物），则使用它们各自的替代特征。",

	"The penumbrals are touched by a bitter, primeval darkness that lurks in corners of the world never touched by sunlight. Such wardens channel this darkness instead of power borne of the natural world to protect themselves and ensnare their enemies.": "penumbrals被一种苦涩、原始的黑暗所触动，这种黑暗潜伏在从未被阳光触及的世界角落。这些看守人引导这种黑暗，而不是自然界的力量，以保护他们自己并诱捕他们的敌人。",
