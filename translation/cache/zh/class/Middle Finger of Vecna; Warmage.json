	"A man, clad in brilliant platinum ceremonial armor rides alongside a unit of soldiers, marching in perfect precision. As he shouts marching commands, his men respond almost preternaturally, anticipating his orders. In rapid succession, each of the men reaches a hand skyward and releases a bright pulse of flame, instants later exploding overhead with a thunderous kaboom. The armored rider takes a few notes, nods his head, and the men begin their display again.": "一个身穿灿烂的铂金仪式盔甲的人与一支士兵部队并肩作战，完美无缺地行进着。当他喊出行军命令时，他的手下几乎是超自然地回应，期待着他的命令。在快速连续的过程中，每个人都向天空伸出一只手，释放出明亮的火焰脉冲，瞬间就在头顶爆炸，发出雷鸣般的爆炸声。盔甲骑士做了一些记录，点了点头，士兵们又开始了他们的表演。",
	"A female elf and twenty trainees stand in something reminiscent of an archery range, though constructed entirely from metal. At her signal, they let loose a barrage of energetic bolts downrange at a cluster of statues. Some miss their mark entirely, while others land only a glancing blow. Shaking her head with disapproval, the elf commands the students to gather behind her. Heat and energy wells in her outstretched palm, then flies downrange, exploding into a brilliant fireball, reducing the statues to rubble. Smirking, she turns and snaps her fingers, and the students quickly retrieve brooms, dustpans, and more statues.": "一个女精灵和20个学员站在一个让人想起射箭场的地方，虽然完全由金属建造。在她的示意下，他们向一群雕像发射了一连串有能量的箭矢。一些人完全没有击中目标，而另一些人则只打了一个闪电。精灵不以为然地摇了摇头，命令学生们聚集在她身后。热量和能量在她伸出的手掌中涌出，然后飞到射程之外，爆炸成一个灿烂的火球，将这些雕像变成了废墟。她冷笑着转过身，打了个响指，学生们迅速拿起扫帚、簸箕和更多雕像。",
	"A thousand armored troops stand at attention in perfect rank and file. To the fore of the group is a raised dais, upon which a half orc kneels before a fire-haired dwarf matron. She taps one of his shoulders, then the other, with an intricate golden rod. Then he stands, and the matron places the rod in his hand and a shield emblazoned with the visage of a horse in his other. The half orc bows and turns to his comrades, instantly cracking the facade: the boom of a thousand voices rises up in cheer, welcoming their new brother into the fold.": "一千名装甲部队以完美的军衔和队列站在那里。在队伍的最前面是一个高台，一个半兽人跪在一个火发的矮人女仆面前。她用一根复杂的金棍拍打着他的一个肩膀，然后是另一个肩膀。然后他站起来，女护士把棍子放在他手里，另一只手拿着一面印有马脸的盾牌。半兽人鞠了一躬，转向他的战友们，瞬间打破了门面：无数的声音响起，欢呼着欢迎他们的新兄弟加入。",
	"Popular as both wartime mercenaries and as peacekeepers, warmages are a unique breed of spellcaster, one that specializes in and perfects the use of the lowest level spells, cantrips. Warmage philosophy teaches that, with discipline, magic can be used at its lowest level as easily as a common warrior wields a bow, a sword, or an axe. When used in this way, magic is not a mysterious, unknowable force, but a trainable weapon, and can be taught to almost anyone with aptitude. The College of Warmages, as a result, has managed to field an army of highly effective (though comparatively simple) spellcasters.": "作为战时雇佣兵和维和人员，暖男是一个独特的法术师品种，他们擅长并完善使用最低级别的法术--咒语。暖男哲学告诉我们，只要有纪律，就可以在最低级别使用魔法，就像普通战士挥舞弓箭、剑或斧头一样容易。当以这种方式使用时，魔法不是一种神秘的、不可知的力量，而是一种可训练的武器，并且几乎可以教给任何有能力的人。因此，魔法师学院已经成功组建了一支高效（虽然相对简单）的施法者军队。",
	"The College of Warmages is viewed with scrutiny (if not outright hostility) by the rest of the world due to their practices and teachings. For those without magical aptitude, the College's overpowering force is a perpetual threat. The College is a host unto itself, and its army, though certainly still honorable, is nonetheless wholly mercenary. A nation that enlists warmage aide in one war might find warmages allied with their enemies in the next.": "由于暖男学院的做法和教义，世界上其他地方的人都对其进行审查（如果不是直接的敌视）。对于那些没有魔法天赋的人来说，学院的超强力量是一种永久的威胁。学院本身就是一个东道主，它的军队，尽管肯定还是很光荣的，但完全是雇佣兵。一个国家如果在一场战争中征用了暖男的帮助，可能会在下一场战争中发现暖男与他们的敌人结盟了。",
	"Wizards and sorcerers, on the other hand, see warmages as rudimentary and trite, largely because warmages do not understand the nuances of magic. Warmages are not interested in studying magic, nor do they wish to plumb the mysteries that confound spellcasters everywhere; they seek only to destroy. For this reason, warmages are even a threat to other spellcasters. Their single-minded utilization of magic has honed their magic's destructive potential, and their great numbers threaten rarer spellcasters in an outright battle. ": "另一方面，魔法师和巫师认为暖男是简陋而陈腐的，主要是因为暖男不了解魔法的细微差别。暖男对研究魔法不感兴趣，他们也不希望探究困惑各地施法者的奥秘；他们只寻求破坏。由于这个原因，暖男们甚至对其他施法者构成了威胁。他们对魔法的一心一意的利用磨练了他们的魔法的破坏力，他们巨大的数量在一场直接的战斗中威胁着稀有的施法者。",
	"While rules, traditions, and the chain of command are rule and law in the College, graduates are afforded ample freedom for travel and adventure. Graduates only need fulfill two requirements: first, the College may recall the warmage to serve once a year, and second, the warmage is never to discredit or dishonor the College. Those who do will find themselves before an inquiry board in short order, and punishments range from lashings and imprisonment, to expulsion from the College and even execution.": "虽然规则、传统和指挥系统是学院的规则和法律，但毕业生有足够的自由去旅行和冒险。毕业生只需满足两个要求：第一，学院可以召回暖男，让其每年服务一次；第二，暖男决不能诋毁或玷污学院的声誉。那些有此行为的人很快就会发现自己被带到调查委员会面前，惩罚范围从鞭打和监禁，到被开除出学院，甚至处决。",
	"The choice to become a warmage is neither easy, nor is it ever accidental. Each and every warmage has both magical aptitude and formal military training, and has made a conscious decision to devote a portion of his or her life to the College. That being said, since the College accepts nearly any candidate that meets the training prerequisites, warmages might come from a myriad of backgrounds and beginnings.": "成为暖男的选择既不容易，也不是偶然的。每一个暖男都有魔法天赋和正式的军事训练，并有意识地决定将他或她的生命的一部分奉献给学院。也就是说，由于学院几乎接受任何符合培训前提条件的候选人，暖男可能来自无数的背景和起点。",
	"Rather central to a warmage's character is his Arcane Initiation. Where did you learn of magic? Is it innate, something you were just born with? Did you grow up in a convent or monastery? Were you apprenticed to a proper wizard or alchemist? As well, why did you choose to reject the path to become a proper spellcaster?": "对暖男的性格来说，最重要的是他的奥术入门。你从哪里学会的魔法？它是与生俱来的，是你与生俱来的东西吗？你是在女修道院或寺院里长大的吗？你是在一个合适的巫师或炼金术士那里当学徒吗？还有，你为什么选择拒绝成为一个正式的施法者的道路？",
	"Though it is a natural choice to select a militaristic background, nearly any can fit into the mold of the college. Were you perhaps a thief or con man who mistakenly stole from a member of the House of Rooks? Were you perhaps a town guard or militia man who came into contact with a Knight, Pawn, or Queen, and was awed by their prowess?": "虽然选择军国主义背景是一个自然的选择，但几乎任何一个人都可以适合学院的模式。你也许是个小偷或骗子，误打误撞地从鲁克家族的成员那里偷了东西？你是否是一名城镇警卫或民兵，接触到了骑士、小卒或皇后，并被他们的能力所震慑？",
	"Lastly, determine which House your warmage wants to belong to. A warmage is initiated into his or her house within the first week of being in the College, but they do not fully graduate until they gain their House subclass at third level. Being a member of a warmage house is much more for a warmage than just selecting a specialty; it is a part of their identity. They will have brothers and sisters the world over who know them by the medal they wear, the symbol they display; there are handshakes, code words, common slang shared between all members of a house, and dozens of other traditions large and small.": "最后，确定你的暖男想属于哪个学院。暖男在进入学院的第一周就开始进入他或她的家族，但直到他们在第三级获得他们的家族子类时才完全毕业。对暖男来说，成为暖男之家的成员不仅仅是选择一个专业，它是他们身份的一部分。他们会有世界各地的兄弟姐妹通过他们佩戴的奖章、展示的标志来了解他们；还有握手、暗语、一个家族所有成员之间共享的共同俚语，以及其他几十个大大小小的传统。",
	"You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the Hours of Knights or Pawns. Then choose the cantrips chill touch, fire bolt, and mage hand, and the scholar Arcane Initiation.": "你可以通过以下建议迅速成为一名暖男。首先，智力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质。如果你打算参加 \"骑士时代 \"或 \"士卒时代\"，那么力量应该是你的第三高分。然后选择咒语 \"寒冰之触\"、\"火弹 \"和 \"法师之手\"，以及学者 \"奥术启动\"。",
	"As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.

	"With a flourish, you summon a number of throwing weapons equal to twice your spellcasting modifier. These weapons can be of any type: daggers, handaxes, sling bullets, darts, etc. For the duration of the spell, the summoned weapons float within easy reach, allowing you to grab and throw them with ease. As an action, you can throw one weapon as a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet. On a hit, the weapon deals {@dice 1d6} magical piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, as appropriate to the weapon thrown. After one attack, the weapon vanishes.": "随着一声欢呼，你会召唤出一定数量的投掷武器，数量相当于你的法术修饰值的两倍。这些武器可以是任何类型的：匕首、手斧、吊弹、飞镖等等。在咒语的持续时间内，被召唤的武器会漂浮在触手可及的地方，让你可以轻松地抓住并投掷它们。作为一个动作，你可以将一件武器作为范围性法术攻击扔出去，范围为60英尺。一旦命中，武器会造成{@dice 1d6}的魔法穿刺、砍击或重击伤害，具体伤害取决于所投掷的武器。一次攻击后，武器会消失。",
	"As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.
