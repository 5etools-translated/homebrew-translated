	"A cloaked man sits in a seedy tavern, a billow of smoke pouring from the folds of his robe, his booted feet rested upon a chairacross from him. A fair maiden enter the room. Immediately, he tosses his hood back, and kicks the chair out from his table. He invites her to sit, gesturing to the seat before beginning to lightly shuffle a deck of cards. He draws three, and places them on the table. She nods, and immediately moves to sit with him. ": "一个披着斗篷的人坐在一个肮脏的酒馆里，一股烟从他的袍子的褶皱里涌出，他的脚踩在他对面的椅子上。一位美丽的少女走进房间。他立即把头巾往后一扔，把椅子从他的桌子上踢开。他邀请她坐下，在开始轻轻洗牌之前，对着座位做了个手势。他抽出三张，放在桌子上。她点点头，并立即移到他身边坐下。",
	"A party of adventurers stand at the feet of a mighty slain dragon. It was a hard fought battle, and even harder won. They look to their leader, who also lay fallen, gasping ragged breaths. A woman in loose robes approaches him, kneeling quietly and smiling. Wordlessly, she pulls a playing card out of her sleeve and presses it against the fallen warrior. His vitality returns, and the group breathes a sigh of relief. ": "一群冒险者站在一只被杀死的强大龙的脚下。这是一场艰苦的战斗，甚至是更艰苦的胜利。他们看向他们的领袖，他也倒下了，喘着粗气。一个穿着宽松长袍的女人走近他，静静地跪着，微笑着。她无声地从袖子里掏出一张扑克牌，按在倒下的战士身上。他的生命力恢复了，大家都松了一口气。",
	"A slight, older man sits in an ornate chair to the side of a great king. The kingdom has fallen into chaos, and there is talk of rebellion. The king turns to his advisor and asks how he can stop this problem before it gets worse. The old man smiles, adjusts his glasses, and pulls out a deck of cards. He begins laying them on a table in an indecipherable pattern. Finally, he places a single card into the middle of the pattern. He hesitates for just a moment before drawing the card. He smiles, and convinces the king that his rule can be assured. ": "一个微胖的老年人坐在一张华丽的椅子上，坐在一个伟大的国王的身边。王国已经陷入混乱，并有叛乱的说法。国王转向他的顾问，问他如何能在问题变得更糟之前阻止它的发生。老人微笑着，调整他的眼镜，并拿出一副牌。他开始把它们放在桌子上，摆出一个难以辨认的图案。最后，他把一张牌放在图案的中间。他在抽出这张牌之前犹豫了一会儿。他微笑着，让国王相信他的统治可以得到保证。"
