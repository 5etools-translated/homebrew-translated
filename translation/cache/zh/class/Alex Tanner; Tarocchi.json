	"A cloaked man sits in a seedy tavern, a billow of smoke pouring from the folds of his robe, his booted feet rested upon a chairacross from him. A fair maiden enter the room. Immediately, he tosses his hood back, and kicks the chair out from his table. He invites her to sit, gesturing to the seat before beginning to lightly shuffle a deck of cards. He draws three, and places them on the table. She nods, and immediately moves to sit with him. ": "一个披着斗篷的人坐在一个肮脏的酒馆里，一股烟从他的袍子的褶皱里涌出，他的脚踩在他对面的椅子上。一位美丽的少女走进房间。他立即把头巾往后一扔，把椅子从他的桌子上踢开。他邀请她坐下，在开始轻轻洗牌之前，对着座位做了个手势。他抽出三张，放在桌子上。她点点头，并立即移到他身边坐下。",
	"A party of adventurers stand at the feet of a mighty slain dragon. It was a hard fought battle, and even harder won. They look to their leader, who also lay fallen, gasping ragged breaths. A woman in loose robes approaches him, kneeling quietly and smiling. Wordlessly, she pulls a playing card out of her sleeve and presses it against the fallen warrior. His vitality returns, and the group breathes a sigh of relief. ": "一群冒险者站在一只被杀死的强大龙的脚下。这是一场艰苦的战斗，甚至是更艰苦的胜利。他们看向他们的领袖，他也倒下了，喘着粗气。一个穿着宽松长袍的女人走近他，静静地跪着，微笑着。她无声地从袖子里掏出一张扑克牌，按在倒下的战士身上。他的生命力恢复了，大家都松了一口气。",
	"A slight, older man sits in an ornate chair to the side of a great king. The kingdom has fallen into chaos, and there is talk of rebellion. The king turns to his advisor and asks how he can stop this problem before it gets worse. The old man smiles, adjusts his glasses, and pulls out a deck of cards. He begins laying them on a table in an indecipherable pattern. Finally, he places a single card into the middle of the pattern. He hesitates for just a moment before drawing the card. He smiles, and convinces the king that his rule can be assured. ": "一个微胖的老年人坐在一张华丽的椅子上，坐在一个伟大的国王的身边。王国已经陷入混乱，并有叛乱的说法。国王转向他的顾问，问他如何能在问题变得更糟之前阻止它的发生。老人微笑着，调整他的眼镜，并拿出一副牌。他开始把它们放在桌子上，摆出一个难以辨认的图案。最后，他把一张牌放在图案的中间。他在抽出这张牌之前犹豫了一会儿。他微笑着，让国王相信他的统治可以得到保证。",
	"Tarocchi are mysterious wielders of magic, not using simple wands or staves, but drawing power from decks of cards. The luck of the draw, and the irony of not having a card you need, is never lost on a tarocchi, who is able to see the long term goal, and make use of what hand of cards they are dealt, both from their power packs, and from life itself. ": "塔罗奇是神秘的魔法师，他们不使用简单的魔杖或棒子，而是从一副牌中汲取力量。抽签的运气，以及没有你需要的牌的讽刺性，对塔罗奇来说永远不会消失，他们能够看到长期的目标，并利用他们所得到的牌，无论是从他们的力量包，还是从生活本身。",
	"A tarocchi's most powerful weapon is their power pack, a deck of cards infused with magical abilities that only they can wield. Sometimes these power packs are legendary artifacts, with intricate artwork on the back, and court cards depicting powerful rulers and tyrants, signifying these decks as special. ": "塔罗克人最强大的武器是他们的能量包，一副注入了只有他们才能挥动的神奇能力的牌。有时，这些能量包是传说中的神器，背面有复杂的艺术品，还有描绘强大统治者和暴君的宫廷牌，标志着这些牌是特别的。",
	"Often, however, these decks simply appear as ordinary playing cards, allowing a tarocchi to feign innocence of their magical abilities. Indeed, power packs can be used as an ordinary deck of cards, and even if the cards are lost or destroyed, they will reform in the tarocchi's pack by the light of the next morning, as arcane magic binds the two together. ": "然而，通常情况下，这些牌只是以普通扑克牌的形式出现，让塔罗奇假装对自己的魔法能力一无所知。事实上，能量包可以作为一副普通的扑克牌使用，即使扑克牌丢失或被毁，它们也会在第二天早上的光亮中重新出现在塔罗奇的包里，因为奥术魔法将两者结合在一起。",
	"Unfortunatley for tarocchi, their magical abilities do not often lend themselves to finding steady work. The unreliability of their powers make others reluctant to employ them, or to rely on them. For this reason, tarocchi often regard their magical abilities as a sort of hobby, one which they must practice and hone in their free time, while finding work elsewhere.": "对Tarocchi来说，不幸的是，他们的魔法能力往往不适合找到稳定的工作。他们的能力不可靠，使别人不愿意雇用他们，也不愿意依赖他们。由于这个原因，塔罗奇常常把他们的魔法能力看作是一种爱好，他们必须在空闲时间练习和磨练，同时在其他地方寻找工作。",
	"The exception to this are tarocchi who are charismatic enough to find themselves in the employ of a thieves' guild, and who can convince the criminals with which they would work that their skills are valuable and reliable, so long as everyone else can be flexible. But to those who can be, a tarocchi is a powerful ally, capable of drawing new hope from their deck, even when all seems lost.": "这方面的例外是那些有足够魅力使自己受雇于盗贼公会的塔罗奇，他们可以说服与他们合作的罪犯，他们的技能是有价值和可靠的，只要其他人都能灵活处理。但对那些可以的人来说，塔罗奇是一个强大的盟友，能够从他们的牌局中汲取新的希望，即使在一切似乎都失去了。",
	"As you create your tarocchi character, think about your personal deck of cards. Where did they come from? Were they a gift, given to you by a family member or trusted friend who knew the secrets? Did you happen upon them, tossed away by someone afraid of their power? Did you purchase them from a mysterious merchant, whom no one else remembers? ": "当你创造你的tarocchi角色时，想想你的个人牌组。它们是从哪里来的？是家庭成员或信任的朋友送给你的礼物，他们知道其中的秘密？你是否偶然发现它们，被害怕它们的力量的人扔掉了？你是否从一个没有人记得的神秘商人那里购买的？",
	"You must also decide where your magical powers came from, as it is the blending of magic and a power pack that makes a tarocchi. Do you have an ancestral bloodline of magic users, whose arcane abilities have been born in you? Have you bonded with an otherworldly being, granting you powerful magic abilities? Or did you find your deck of cards and determine to learn more, poring over and studying ancienct texts to determine the true power of the cards?": "你还必须决定你的魔法力量来自哪里，因为正是魔法和力量包的融合才造就了一个塔罗奇。你是否有一个魔法使用者的祖先血统，他们的奥术能力已经在你身上诞生？你是否与一个异世界的人结合，赋予你强大的魔法能力？还是你发现了你的这副牌，并决定了解更多，翻阅和研究古代的文字来确定牌的真正力量？",
	"You can make a tarocchi quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background charlatan} backgrond. Third, choose the {@spell light}, {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell ray of frost}, and {@spell shocking grasp} cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells {@spell charm person} and {@spell magic missile}.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快做出一个tarocchi。首先，让魅力成为你最高的能力分数，其次是体质。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。第三，选择(1%)、(2%)、(3%)和(4%)的咒语，以及一级法术{@spell charm person}和(6%)。",
	"There are several terms that are unique to the tarocchi.": "有几个术语是tarocchi所特有的。",
	"The <b>rank</b> of a card is its numerical value. So a card can have a rank of \"3,\" which includes the 3 card in all four suits, or a rank of \"9,\" or \"king,\" and so on. ": "一张牌的<b>等级</b>是其数值。因此，一张牌的等级可以是 \"3\"，包括所有四种花色中的3张牌，也可以是 \"9\"，或 \"王\"，以此类推。",
	"You can <b>discard</b> cards from your hand without playing them. These cards go to your discard pile, but do not activate any kind of magical effect.": "你可以从你的手牌中<b>弃牌</b>而不出牌。这些牌会进入你的弃牌堆，但不会激活任何形式的魔法效果。",
	"When you <b>play</b> a card, you are activating its magic and (usually) casting a spell as you do so. ": "当你<b>打出</b>一张牌时，你是在激活它的魔法，并且（通常）在这样做时施放一个法术。",
	"Like a wizard with a spellbook, your power pack is a physical object which can be lost or destroyed. ": "就像巫师的法术书一样，你的能量包是一个实物，可以丢失或销毁。",
	"Your power pack is typically a box, but it can also be some kind of special leather case or wrapping that keeps your cards together. So long as this housing is intact and complete, all of your cards will return to it when you finish a long rest. This includes situations where cards are lost or destroyed; they will still reform in your power pack. ": "你的能量包通常是一个盒子，但它也可以是某种特殊的皮套或包装，把你的牌放在一起。只要这个外壳完整无缺，当你完成长时间的休息时，你所有的牌都会回到它里面去。这包括卡牌丢失或毁坏的情况；它们仍会在你的能量包中重新组合。",
	"If the pack itself is destroyed, however, the magic of the cards ceases to exist. Your pack is a powerful magical item, and so is more resilient than it may appear. If the pack is destroyed, you will need to replace it. It takes 2 hours and 50 gp per spell level that you have access to. Once you have forged a new pack to hold your cards, they reform normally when you finish your next long rest. ": "然而，如果牌包本身被毁，牌的魔力就不复存在。你的牌包是一个强大的魔法物品，所以比它看起来更有弹性。如果牌包被毁，你将需要替换它。这需要2个小时和你能使用的每个法术等级50金币。一旦你铸造了一个新的牌包来容纳你的牌，它们就会在你完成下一次长时休息时正常复原。",
	"Each power pack is unique, and are only typically recognized as special by other tarocchi. It may be a plain, functional set of leather straps which hold your cards together, or it may be an ornate magical box, inlaid with gold and intricate designs. ": "每个能量包都是独一无二的，通常只有其他tarocchi才会认为它是特别的。它可能是一套普通的、实用的皮带，将你的卡片固定在一起，也可能是一个华丽的魔法盒，镶嵌着黄金和复杂的设计。",
	"Your cards, like your power pack, are also highly variable. They may be very simple cards with plain backs and bare markings, or they may be incredibly detailed, with flourishes of artistic skill on the backs, and beautifully calligraphed symbols on the fronts.": "你的卡片，就像你的能量包一样，也是高度可变的。它们可能是非常简单的卡片，背面只有简单的标记，或者它们可能非常详细，背面有艺术技巧的装饰，正面有漂亮的书法符号。",
	"Some event in your past, whether it be through blood or study or making a pact with an otherworldly being, has left the indelible mark of arcane magic upon you. Along with a magical deck of cards that you have come into possession of, you are able to create powerful magical effects, so long as you draw the right card.": "在你过去的一些事件中，无论是通过血缘、学习还是与其他世界的人签订契约，都在你身上留下了不可磨灭的奥秘魔法的痕迹。伴随着你所拥有的一副神奇的牌，你能够创造出强大的魔法效果，只要你抽到正确的牌。",
	"Unlike other magic users, you use your cards to fund your arcane abilities directly, meaning that you cast magic spells in a unique way.": "与其他魔法使用者不同，你用你的卡片直接资助你的奥术能力，这意味着你以一种独特的方式施展魔法咒语。",
