In addition, whenever you make a Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check on a creature that can see or hear you, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as a 8.": "当你在3级时选择这个法令，你的存在甚至可以使最勇敢的英雄在你的力量面前俯首称臣。如果你还没有熟练掌握（%0%）技能，你会获得熟练掌握。此外，每当你对一个能看到或听到你的生物进行魅力（%%）检查时，如果在d20上掷出7或更低的分数，则将其视为8。",
	"At 3rd level, after using Deflective Strike, your soul manifests a dark, ravenous power. This dark energy lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can have only one of these within you at a time. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend this dark energy to target an enemy creature that you can see within 10 feet of you.

The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the target has dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn.": "3级时，在使用防御性打击后，你的灵魂会显现出一种黑暗的、贪婪的力量。这种黑暗能量一直持续到你的下一个回合结束，而且你体内一次只能有一个这样的能量。作为你回合中的额外行动，你可以消耗这种黑暗能量来瞄准一个你能看到的10英尺范围内的敌方生物。目标必须对你的蒙面英雄法术救赎的力量投掷成功，否则会受到{@dice 1d6}酸性伤害，并被黑色锁链束缚1分钟。如果目标在你上一回合结束后对你造成了伤害，那么你的蓄力将处于不利地位。",
	"While a creature is bound, its speed is reduced to 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it can't teleport by any means short of a 3rd-level spell or higher. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, the creature breaks free as the chains vanish. On a failure, the creature remains bound by the chains, and takes {@dice 1d6} acid damage once again.": "当一个生物被束缚时，它的速度被降低到0，它不能从其速度的任何奖励中获益，而且它不能通过任何方法传送，除非是3级以上的法术。在它的每个回合结束时，它可以再做一次力量救赎动作。如果成功，该生物就会随着锁链的消失而挣脱。如果失败，该生物将继续被锁链束缚，并再次受到（%0%）酸性伤害。",

	"At 7th level, you are always ready for bloodshed, no matter where you find your foes. You gain a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). In addition, on your first turn of each combat, if you use a bonus action to transform, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same action.": "在第7级时，无论你在哪里找到你的敌人，你都准备好了血战。你在你的主动性卷轴上获得相当于你的魅力修改器的奖励（最小为1）。此外，在你每次战斗的第一个回合中，如果你使用奖励动作进行变身，你可以作为同一动作的一部分进行一次武器攻击。",
