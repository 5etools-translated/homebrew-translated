An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.": "一个穿着铿锵有力的板甲的人类在她面前举着她的盾牌，向大批的地精跑去。她身后的一个精灵，身穿镶钉皮甲，用他精致的弓箭射向地精们。旁边的半兽人喊着命令，帮助这两个战斗人员协调他们的攻击，以获得最佳优势。",
	"A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.": "一个穿着链甲的矮人将他的盾牌插在食人魔的棍子和他的同伴之间，将致命的一击打到一边。他的同伴，一个身穿鳞甲的半精灵，挥舞着两把弯刀打出了一个刺眼的旋涡，她围着食人魔转，寻找它的防御盲点。",
	"A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.": "一个角斗士在竞技场上为运动而战，他是一个使用三叉戟和网的高手，熟练地推翻敌人，让他们在观众的欢呼声中移动，也是他自己的战术优势。他的对手的剑在她发出闪电击打他之前的一瞬间发出了蓝光。",
	"All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.": "所有这些英雄都是战士，也许是《龙与地下城》世界中最多样化的一类角色。探险的骑士、征服的霸主、皇家的冠军、精锐的步兵、坚韧的雇佣兵和强盗之王--作为战士，他们都对武器和盔甲有着无与伦比的掌握，对战斗的技巧也有着透彻的了解。他们对死亡非常熟悉，既能将其击倒，又能轻蔑地盯着它。",
	"Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.": "战士们学习所有战斗风格的基础知识。每个战士都能挥舞斧头，用剑杆击剑，挥舞长剑或大剑，使用弓箭，甚至能在某种程度上熟练地将敌人困在网中。同样地，战士也善于使用盾牌和各种形式的盔甲。除了这种基本的熟悉程度之外，每个战士都擅长于某种战斗风格。有些人专注于射箭，有些人同时使用两种武器作战，有些人则用魔法来增强他们的武术技能。这种广泛的综合能力和广泛的专业化的结合，使战士们在战场上和地牢中都是卓越的战斗人员。",

Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.": "不是每一个城市守望者、乡村民兵或女王军队的成员都是战士。这些部队中的大多数是相对没有受过训练的士兵，只有最基本的战斗知识。老兵、军官、训练有素的保镖、专职骑士和类似的人物都是战士。",
	"Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.": "有些战士感到被吸引来使用他们作为冒险家的训练。深入地牢、杀死怪物和其他在冒险者中常见的危险工作是战士的第二天性，与他或她留下的生活没有什么不同。也许有更大的风险，但也有更大的回报--例如，在城市观察中很少有战士有机会发现一把神奇的焰舌剑。",
	"As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.": "当你建立你的战士时，想想你的角色背景中的两个相关元素。你在哪里接受的战斗训练，是什么让你与周围的普通战士不同？你是否特别冷酷无情？你是否从导师那里得到了额外的帮助，也许是因为你的特殊奉献精神？首先是什么驱使你接受这种训练的？对祖国的威胁，对复仇的渴望，或者对证明自己的需要，可能都是因素。",
	"You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace": "你可能在贵族的军队或地方民兵中接受过正式的训练。也许你在战争学院受训，学习战略、战术和军事历史。或者你可能是自学成才--没有经过打磨，但经过良好的测试。你拿起剑是为了摆脱农场生活的局限性，还是在遵循一个自豪的家族传统？你的武器和盔甲是从哪里获得的？它们可能是军方发行的或家族的传家宝，也可能是你节衣缩食多年买来的。你的武器现在是你最重要的财产之一，是你和死亡的拥抱之间唯一的东西。",
	"You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名战士。首先，根据你是想专注于近战武器还是射箭（或精巧的武器），将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分。你的第二高分应该是体质，如果你打算采用埃尔德里奇骑士的武术原型，则是智力。第二，选择士兵背景。",

Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for this spell.": "作为一个动作，你出示一个你的信仰符号，并说出一个祈祷词，呼唤你的神灵的帮助。当你使用这个功能时，你可以施放一个适当级别或更低的单体（%0%），如下面的天赋魔法表所示。魅力是你对这个法术的施法修改器。",
	"Also at 3rd level, you learn the {@spell guidance} cantrip and gain proficiency in either {@skill Religion} or {@skill History} (your choice). You also gain the ability to use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for spells you cast granted by your Channel Divinity.": "同样在3级时，你学会了{@spell guidance}咒语，并获得{@skill Religion}或{@skill History}的熟练度（由你选择）。你也获得了使用神圣符号作为你施展的法术的焦点的能力，该能力由你的通道神性授予。",
	"Starting at 7th level, you've become adept at predicting the nature of magic and delaying its effect. If a creature you can see or hear within 60 feet casts a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to stall its effect and potentially end it. If that spell is 3rd level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action or less, that creature must make a contested Charisma check to resist your delaying effect. If you succeed, the creature is forced to concentrate on the spell until it's next turn, and the creature must cast the spell immediately at the start of it's turn (no action required). If it can't, the spell is wasted.": "从第七级开始，你已经善于预测魔法的性质并延迟其效果。如果一个你能看到或听到的60英尺范围内的生物施法，你可以用你的反应来试图拖延它的效果并有可能结束它。如果该法术是第三级或更低，并且施法时间为1个动作或更短，该生物必须进行有争议的魅力检查以抵抗你的延迟效果。如果你成功了，该生物将被迫在下一回合前集中精力施展该法术，并且该生物必须在其回合开始时立即施展该法术（无需行动）。如果它不能，那么这个咒语就浪费了。",
	"You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能两次。在完成长时间的休息后，你会重新获得所有消耗的使用权。",
	"Beginning at 10th level, your experience dealing with magic and its effects has given you a sheen of reflex against it. After taking damage from a spell or magical source, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn. If a single spell or effect deals damage of more than one type, you gain resistances to all types dealt.": "从10级开始，你与魔法及其影响打交道的经验使你对魔法有了反射的光泽。在受到法术或魔法源的伤害后，你可以使用你的反应来获得对该伤害类型的抵抗，直到你的下一个回合结束。如果一个单一的法术或效果造成了不止一种类型的伤害，你会获得对所有类型伤害的抗性。",
	"At 15th level, your diety has rewarded you for your furious pursuit of your goal. You and any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see or hear you gain temporary hit points equal to your Fighter level when you use Action Surge.": "15级时，你的神灵奖励你对目标的狂热追求。当你使用 \"行动突进 \"时，你和30英尺内能看到或听到你的任何数量的生物都会获得与你的战士等级相等的临时命中率。",
	"Starting at 18th level, your mastery over fighting spellcasters has allowed you to develop a technique for interrupting their ongoing magical boons. Any maneuver you use that affects a creature forces that creature to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain their concentration. The DC for this is equal to your maneuver save DC. If the maneuver also deals damage to the creature, it must make a separate concentration check for that damage as normal.": "从18级开始，你对战斗中的施法者的掌握使你能够开发出一种技术来打断他们正在进行的魔法恩惠。你所使用的任何影响生物的动作都会迫使该生物进行一次宪法救赎以保持其注意力。这个DC等于你的演习救赎DC。如果该动作也对该生物造成伤害，它必须为该伤害进行单独的注意力检查，如常。"
