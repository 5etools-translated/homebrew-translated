	"Any spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature are converted to sorcery points. Once you have added together your levels as prescribed in the Spell Slots section, take the resulting total and refer to the Sorcerer table for that level to determine the amount of sorcery points you have. For example, a character with 3 sorcerer levels and 2 paladin levels counts as a 4th-level sorcerer for the purposes of determining that character's total sorcery points.": "你从咒语功能中获得的任何咒语槽都会转化为巫术点数。一旦你按照 \"法术槽 \"部分的规定将你的等级相加，取其总数并参考该等级的巫师表，以确定你的巫术点数的数量。例如，一个拥有3个巫师等级和2个圣骑士等级的角色，在确定该角色的总巫术点数时，算作一个四级巫师。",
	"The {@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}} contains a variant rule for {@variantrule spell points}, an alternative to spell slots that draws your magical power from a pool rather than using slots to cast spells. This rule is controversial for most spellcasters, as it grants a large pool of low level spells without much justification. Sorcerers, however, have the Font of Magic feature, which allows them to interchange spell slots and sorcery points. This creates a dynamic that closely emulates spell points without actually using them.": "{@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}}包含一个{@variantrule spell points}的变体规则，这是一种替代法术槽的方法，从一个池子里吸取你的魔力，而不是使用法术槽来施法。这条规则对大多数法术师来说是有争议的，因为它在没有太多理由的情况下授予了大量的低级法术池。然而，巫师有 \"魔法字体 \"功能，允许他们互换法术槽和巫术点数。这就创造了一种密切模仿法术点的动态，而不需要实际使用它们。",
	"Using this concept as a baseline, I've created a variant of the sorcerer which has a modified version of the spell points rule and adds some new features. Its purpose is to allow use of spell points with less of the abuse of low level spells granted by spell points at later character levels.": "以这个概念为基准，我创造了一个巫师的变体，它有一个修改版的法术点数规则，并增加了一些新功能。它的目的是允许使用法术点数，减少后期角色等级时法术点数所赋予的低级法术的滥用。",
	"Another issue that sorcerers have is their lack of spells known, and the \"metagame\" of their metamagic options. To this end, I've modified the Font of Magic feature to allow short bursts of powerful casting, and I've given each origin an additional known spell of levels 1-5. For the remaining Metamagic, I've given new options, more frequent and consistent intervals at which the sorcerer learns metamagic, and allowed you to swap metamagic choices when you gain a new one.": "巫师的另一个问题是他们缺乏已知的法术，以及他们的法术选择的 \"混乱\"。为此，我修改了 \"魔法字体 \"的功能，以允许短时间内进行强大的施法，并且我给每个原点增加了1-5级的已知法术。对于其余的元术，我给出了新的选择，让巫师学习元术的时间间隔更加频繁和一致，并允许你在获得新的元术选择时进行交换。",
	"This sorcerer uses a modified version of the DMG's {@variantrule spell points|DMG|spell point} rule, which has been simplified. It also incorporates a more powerful version of the Warlock's {@classFeature Mystic Arcanum (6th level)|Warlock||11||Mystic Arcanum} feature. This combination helps to round out the issues with sorcery points at later levels by reducing the sorcery point pool.": "这个巫师使用的是DMG的{@variantrule spell points|DMG|spell point}规则的修改版，已经被简化。它还结合了术士的{@classFeature Mystic Arcanum (6th level)|Warlock||11||Mystic Arcanum}特性的一个更强大的版本。这种组合有助于通过减少巫术点数池来圆润地解决后期的巫术点数问题。",
	"Particularly, the overwhelming amount of low-level spells you can cast at player levels beyond 10 is replaced with powerful high-level spellcasting. The intent of these changes is to make the sorcerer a much more varied caster, and to make it as spontaneous as I feel comfortable with in 5th edition.": "特别是，在玩家等级超过10级时可以施放的大量低级法术被强大的高级法术所取代。这些变化的意图是使巫师成为一个更加多样化的施法者，并使其成为我在第五版中感到舒服的自发性的施法者。",
	"The sorcerer's {@classFeature Sorcerous Restoration|Sorcerer||20||level 20 feature} is not terribly weak, but it's underwhelming for the level at which you get it. {@classFeature Arcane Recovery|Wizard||1||Wizards} and {@subclassFeature Natural Recovery|Druid||Land||2||Land Druids} can regain spell slots starting at level 2, and it scales throughout their career. Sorcerers get metamagic instead, but as a class that is driven by their spellcasting capabilities, they deserved to have something similar, so I moved it to level 3 and made it scale with your level. I added a new capstone to replace it: a feature that truly makes you a master of flexing your spellcasting. It's powerful, but fun for such high levels.": "巫师的（%0%）并不是非常弱，但对于你得到它的等级来说，它是令人难以接受的。{@classFeature Arcane Recovery|Wizard||1||Wizards}和{@subclassFeature Natural Recovery|Druid||Land||2||Land Druids}可以从2级开始重新获得法术槽，并且在他们的职业生涯中不断扩展。巫师得到的是元魔法，但作为一个由法术能力驱动的等级，他们应该有类似的东西，所以我把它移到了3级，并使它随着你的等级而扩展。我添加了一个新的顶点来取代它：一个真正使你成为灵活运用法术的大师的功能。它很强大，但对如此高的等级来说很有趣。",
	"Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.": "金色的眼睛闪闪发光，一个人类伸出她的手，释放出她血管中燃烧的龙火。当地狱之火在她的敌人周围肆虐时，皮革般的翅膀从她的背上展开，她飞上了天空。",
	"Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.": "半精灵的长发被魔法风吹动，他张开双臂，把头向后甩。瞬间将他抬离地面，一股魔力在他体内涌动，穿过他的身体，从他身上喷出一股强大的闪电。",
	"Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.": "蹲在石笋后面，一个半身人用手指着一个冲锋的蛙人。一股火焰从她的手指中喷出，击中了这个生物。她笑着躲到岩层后面，不知道她的野生魔法已经把她的皮肤变成了明亮的蓝色。",
	"Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.": "巫师拥有一种由异国血统、某些异世界的影响或接触未知宇宙力量而赋予他们的魔法天赋。一个人不可能像学习语言一样学习巫术，就像一个人不可能学会过传奇的生活一样。没有人选择巫术；力量选择巫师。",
	"Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.": "魔法是每个巫师的一部分，它使身体、思想和精神充满了潜在的力量，等待着被挖掘。一些巫师挥舞着来自古老血脉的魔法，其中注入了龙的魔法。其他巫师则携带着一种原始的、不受控制的魔法，一种以意想不到的方式表现出来的混乱的风暴。",
	"The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.": "巫术力量的出现是非常难以预测的。一些龙人血统每一代都会产生一个巫师，但在其他血统中，每个人都是巫师。大多数时候，巫术的天赋是以明显的侥幸心理出现的。一些巫师无法说出他们力量的来源，而其他巫师则将其追溯到他们自己生活中的奇怪事件。恶魔的触摸，婴儿出生时干尸的祝福，或者尝到神秘泉水的味道，都可能激发出巫术的天赋。魔法之神的恩赐、接触到内部星球的元素力量或Limbo的疯狂混乱，或者瞥见现实的内部运作，也都可能激发巫术的天赋。",
	"Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.": "巫师不需要巫师所依赖的法术书和古老的魔法传说书，他们也不像术士那样依赖赞助人授予他们法术。通过学习驾驭和引导自己与生俱来的魔力，他们可以发现新的、令人震惊的方法来释放这种力量。",
	"Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.": "巫师在这个世界上是很罕见的，不以某种方式参与冒险生活的巫师是不常见的。血管里涌动着魔法力量的人很快就会发现，这种力量并不喜欢保持安静。巫师的魔法想要被挥舞，如果不被召唤，它就会以不可预知的方式溢出来。",
	"Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.": "巫师们往往有晦涩难懂的动机，促使他们去冒险。有些人寻求对注入他们体内的魔法力量有更多的了解，或对其起源之谜的答案。其他人则希望找到摆脱它的方法，或释放其全部潜力。无论他们的目标是什么，巫师对冒险队伍来说都和巫师一样有用，他们在使用他们所知道的法术时具有巨大的灵活性，从而弥补了他们在魔法知识方面相对缺乏的广度。",
	"The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?": "在创建你的巫师时要考虑的最重要的问题是你的力量的来源。作为一个起始角色，你将选择一个与龙人血统或野生魔法影响有关的起源，但你的力量的确切来源由你决定。它是一个家族的诅咒，从遥远的祖先传给你的？还是某些特殊事件让你受到固有魔法的祝福，但也许也留下了伤痕？",
	"How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.": "你对流经你体内的神奇力量有什么感觉？你是拥抱它，试图掌握它，还是陶醉于它不可预测的性质？它是一种祝福还是一种诅咒？是你寻找它，还是它找到你？你是否可以选择拒绝它，你是否希望你能拒绝它？你打算用它做什么？也许你觉得你被赋予这种力量是为了某种崇高的目的。或者你可能决定，这种权力给了你权利去做你想做的事，从那些缺乏这种权力的人那里夺取你想要的东西。也许你的力量将你与这个世界上某个强大的个体联系起来--在你出生时祝福你的精灵生物，将它的一滴血注入你血管的龙，创造你作为实验品的巫师，或者选择你携带这种力量的神灵。",
	"You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the {@spell light}, {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell ray of frost}, and {@spell shocking grasp} cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells {@spell shield} and {@spell magic missile}.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名巫师。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质。第二，选择隐士的背景。第三，选择{@spell light}、{@spell prestidigitation}、{@spell ray of frost}和{@spell shocking grasp}的咒语，以及一级法术{@spell shield}和{@spell magic missile}。",
	"Practice and study are for amateurs. True power is a birthright.": "练习和学习是为业余爱好者准备的。真正的力量是与生俱来的。",
	"When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.": "说到在需要的时候发挥他们的能力，与其他角色相比，巫师们很容易。他们的力量不仅存在于他们体内，而且很可能需要付出一些努力才能将其控制住。每个巫师都是为这个角色而生的，或者是通过宇宙的机会偶然进入这个角色。与其他角色不同的是，巫师必须主动学习、接受和追求他们的天赋，而他们的力量是被推到他们身上的。",
	"Because the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.": "因为很多人对一个天生有魔法的人在他们中间旅行的想法不以为然，所以巫师们往往会对他们遇到的其他人产生不信任和猜疑。尽管如此，许多巫师通过有利于他们那些魔法天赋较低的同龄人的行为，成功地克服了这种偏见。",
	"Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.": "巫师通常是由围绕着他们的力量表现的事件来定义的。对于那些将其作为一种预期的天生权利的人来说，其出现是一个值得庆祝的理由。其他巫师则被视为弃儿，在他们的能力突然出现后被逐出家门，令人恐惧。",
	"Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarding as it is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on how to flesh out and personalize your persona.": "扮演一个巫师角色既能带来回报，又能带来挑战。下面的章节提供了关于如何充实和个性化你的角色的建议。",
	"Some sorcerers understand where their power came from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a way that suggests no particular cause.": "一些巫师明白他们的力量来自哪里，基于他们的能力是如何表现出来的。其他人只能猜测，因为他们的能力是以一种没有特定原因的方式出现的。",
	"Does your character know the source of your magical power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn't know where their power arose from, your DM can use this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when the information plays a role in the campaign.": "你的角色知道你的魔法力量的来源吗？它是否与某个遥远的亲戚、某个宇宙事件或盲目的机会有关？如果你的巫师不知道他们的力量从何而来，你的DM可以使用这个表格（或选择一个来源），并在信息在活动中发挥作用时向你透露。",

Even so, many sorcerers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them apart from other folk.": "巫师在休息时几乎与普通人无异；只有当他们的魔法飞出时，巫师才会暴露出他们的真实本性。即便如此，许多巫师都有一个微妙但能说明问题的身体特征，使他们有别于其他民族。",
	"If your sorcerer has a supernatural mark, it might be one that's easily concealed, or it could be a source of pride that you keep on constant display.": "如果你的巫师有一个超自然的标记，它可能是一个很容易隐藏的标记，或者它可能是你不断展示的骄傲的来源。",

	"As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell.
