	"Lycanthropy is an ancient and feared curse, able to turn the most stalwart of men into slavering and savage beasts. They are rightfully feared by a lot of common folk and are able to tear creatures to pieces with their hands alone. Because of this, lycanthropes are a force to be reckoned with. However, not all lycanthropes are evil beasts enslaved to their vicious nature. Those who take their time to train themselves and focus their minds can unlock their bestial power and use it for their own desires. Able to shift into animalistic hybrids and shrug off wounds that would fell mortal men, lycanthropes that follow this path become the ultimate predators.
