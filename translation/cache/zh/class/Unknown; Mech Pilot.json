	"The battle seems lost. The body of your party´s fighter dangles from a spear held by a hatefully laughing orc, meanwhile your sorcerer, that ran out of spells a while ago, screams in panic while being chased by three blood-hungry mercenaries, stabbing him with their daggers and cackling hysterically. And you? You lay in the puddle of whats left from your party. You are bleeding profusely while slowly losing conciousness. The only thing you can see now, is an army, walking towards you in perfect synchronisation, eagerly awaiting to finally fulfill their duty and collect their toll...": "这场战斗似乎已经失去了意义。你方战士的尸体被一个憎恨地大笑的兽人拿着长矛吊着，与此同时，你的巫师，刚才已经用完了法术，惊恐地尖叫着，被三个嗜血的雇佣兵追着，用他们的匕首刺他，歇斯底里地笑着。而你呢？你躺在你的队伍中剩下的那一滩东西里。你正在大量出血，同时慢慢失去意识。你现在唯一能看到的是一支军队，正完美地同步向你走来，急切地等待着最终履行他们的职责，收取他们的报酬......",
	"Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you see a four-legged beast, completely made of metal appear from thin air, firing five extremely fast objects, leaving a huge cloud of smoke. A fraction of a second later, hundreds of soldiers are sent flying into the air, carried by an enormous shockwave that shakes you to the bone.": "突然，从你的眼角，你看到一个完全由金属制成的四脚兽从空气中出现，发射了五个极快的物体，留下一团巨大的烟雾。几分之一秒后，数百名士兵被巨大的冲击波带着飞向空中，把你震得浑身发抖。",
	"As you look towards the rest of you party, you see the three mercenaries getting skewered by an enormous humanoid made of steel. It tackles them over the battlefield with abnormal speed while a tiny goblin, sitting where this thing should have its chest and neck, cackles even more insanely and happily than his victims did before. With a crunch the mercenaries are smashed against a nearby wall.": "当你看向其余的人时，你看到三个雇佣兵被一个钢铁制成的巨大人形物体串起来。它以不正常的速度在战场上对付他们，而一个小妖精，坐在这个东西应该有的胸口和脖子的地方，比他的受害者之前更加疯狂和快乐地咯咯笑着。随着一声脆响，雇佣兵们被砸到了附近的墙上。",
	"You turn around to see the battlefield engulfed in flames while the first metal beast unleashes a nova of deafeningly loud shots, mowing down dozens of soldiers. The metal humanoid charges into the flames and disappeares, just to erupt again in the middle of that army, flinging around soldiers like leaves in the wind. Seconds later, it becomes silent. The battlefield has turned into an enormous bloodbath and some leftover stragglers run away in horror while one after another is taken out by a precise shot to their heads.": "你转过身来，看到战场被火焰吞噬，而第一只金属兽释放出震耳欲聋的新星，砍倒了几十个士兵。金属人形冲进火焰并消失了，只是在那支军队中间再次爆发，像风中的树叶一样把士兵们甩来甩去。几秒钟后，它变得寂静无声。战场变成了一场巨大的血战，一些剩下的散兵游勇惊恐地跑开了，而一个又一个人被精确地射中头部干掉了。",
	"You look over to your sorcerer, that still stares at the smashed remains of these mercenaries. You whisper: 'Are we the ones being saved?'": "你看了看你的巫师，他仍然盯着这些雇佣兵的残骸。你小声说：\"我们是被拯救的人吗？",
	"The humanoid walks between you, blocking your sight at the sorcerer, while the first metal construct bows down to you, loading the next shot with a snarring sound....": "那个人形生物走到你们中间，挡住了你们对巫师的视线，而第一个金属构件向你们鞠躬，用刺耳的声音装入下一个镜头....",
	"While most of the classic schools of magical study are well known and widely respected, the less refined and macabre incantations of Hemocraft have long been forbidden and lost to most of the civilized world. Blood Hunters have reclaimed these techniques away from the judging eyes of society, finding blood magic's esoteric nature effective against the evils that often defy the divine powers that historically hold the line.": "虽然大多数经典的魔法研究流派都是众所周知的，并受到广泛的尊重，但血魔法的不太精致和可怕的咒语长期以来一直被禁止，并被大多数文明世界所遗忘。猎血人在远离社会评判的目光下重新获得了这些技术，他们发现血魔法的神秘性可以有效地对抗那些经常藐视历史上把持的神圣力量的邪恶。",
	"Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes.": "通过仔细的研究和实践，血族猎人已经将血液工艺的仪式磨练成了他们的战斗力，放弃了他们健康的一个方面，为他们的武器注入强大的血液魔法，并召唤元素来笼罩他们的攻击。",
	"They can sear an arcane brand into the body of their quarry that hinders their foe's abilities and punishes their aggression, or call blood curses upon their enemies, manipulating their bodies from the inside. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.": "他们可以在猎物的身体上烙下奥术烙印，阻碍敌人的能力，惩罚他们的侵略行为，或者对敌人发出血腥的诅咒，从内部操纵他们的身体。为了取得胜利，他们愿意承受任何代价，这些精明的战士将自己锻造成一股强大的力量，对抗威胁无辜者的恐怖。",
	"Whether driven by the wish to make a difference in a dangerous world, the need to take vengeance for a great wrong they have suffered, being inspired by witnessing the strange and powerful techniques of another blood hunter in person, or just seeking a place to belong in an uncaring world, the reasons one may take up the Hunter's Bane and choose this life are many and varied. In joining an order of blood hunters, one is also joining a tight family bound by service to each other and the common cause. For many, this is the only family they have known or have left, so the kinship felt between members of an order is a bond neigh unbreakable.": "无论是出于在危险的世界中有所作为的愿望，还是为自己所遭受的巨大损失进行复仇的需要，或是因为亲眼目睹了另一个血族猎人的奇怪而强大的技术而受到启发，或者只是在一个无情的世界中寻求一个归属的地方，一个人可能拿起猎人之刃并选择这种生活的原因是多种多样的。在加入血族猎人组织的过程中，人们也加入了一个紧密的家庭，彼此之间的服务和共同的事业联系在一起。对许多人来说，这是他们唯一知道的或已经离开的家庭，因此，骑士团成员之间的亲情是一种几乎牢不可破的纽带。",
	"Beyond the boundaries of the order, however, the life of a blood hunter is often not an easy one. The rituals of the Hunter's Bane regularly leave one visibly changed and prone to unsettle common folk, and the witnessing of hemocraft can invoke a superstitious fear from even the most learned scholar. While some societies have come to accept the good deeds of the orders, many blood hunters publicly hide their nature unless absolutely necessary, feeling more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world where the Orders commonly train. Even so, the best work a blood hunter can do usually involves the poor and defenseless on the outskirts of society, those prone to the corrupting touch of fiends and dark intension. Braving the threat of vilification, these dark protectors wade through civilization, earning coin as mercenaries or bounty hunters, ever watching for the signs of something more nefarious beneath the surface.": "然而，在教团的边界之外，猎血人的生活往往并不轻松。猎人之刃的仪式经常使人明显改变，容易使普通人感到不安，而目睹血手艺的人甚至会引起最博学的学者的迷信恐惧。虽然有些社会已经接受了骑士团的善行，但许多血族猎人除非有必要，否则会公开隐藏自己的本性，在骑士团经常训练的荒野和废墟中感到更加舒适。即便如此，血族猎人能做的最好的工作通常涉及社会边缘的穷人和无助者，那些容易受到恶魔和黑暗意图腐蚀的人。冒着被诋毁的威胁，这些黑暗的保护者在文明中游走，作为雇佣兵或赏金猎人赚取钱财，时刻注意着表面下更邪恶的东西的迹象。",
	"In choosing this path, a blood hunter has irrevocably given a part of themselves to their cause, physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. The orders of blood hunters practice their own unique ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of these guardians. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle, so a life of discipline and vigilance drives their travels as they wander the country side in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.": "在选择这条道路时，猎血者已经不可逆转地将自己的一部分献给了他们的事业，包括身体上、情感上，有时还有道德上。猎血者的组织实行他们自己独特的理想和方法，经常采用具有黑暗起源的技术，考验这些守护者的力量和意志。许多人与失去斗争的恐惧搏斗，因此，纪律和警惕的生活驱使他们在乡间游荡，寻找志同道合的冒险者和黑暗行动的耳语。",
	"As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?": "当你创造一个血腥的猎人时，你的角色最重要的方面是你为什么被驱使到这种生活方式，以及你为什么寻求放弃一切，与你所猎杀的恶魔一起沉湎于黑暗之中？你是否在邪恶的野兽面前失去了亲人，现在希望防止其他人遭受同样的命运？你是否寻求一种目标和安全感，并在接纳你的秩序中找到了这种感觉？你是否一直带着黑暗的种子，并寻求亲属来看护你，防止你屈服于它？你是否曾经是一名神圣的战士，但却偏离了他的信仰而被驱逐出去，但仍然寻求为保护无辜者的事业奉献自己？或者你是一个有着黑暗过去的罪犯，寻求弥补，把这一生作为忏悔的道路？",
	"What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises to grant you as you step closer to its mastery? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?": "你与血脉的力量和它承诺在你接近它的掌握时授予你的能力是什么关系？你是否尊重和惧怕涌动在你血管中的古老力量，只在必要时使用它们？你是否对它提供给你的力量津津乐道，拥抱你的天赋并自由使用它们？你是否担心迷信是正确的，这种力量最终会把你变成你猎杀的怪物之一？或者，你的学习已经给你灌输了心灵控制物质的自信，确信你可以弯曲这些天赋，带来更光明的曙光？",
	"Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?": "也要考虑到，虽然血族猎人属于一个教团，但许多人自己出击，做他们最好的工作。是什么让你离开了舒适的教团？你是否打算回来，或者你决定在外面的世界里有更多的东西要学？你在其他冒险者身上寻找什么，可以帮助你实现你的目标？",
	"While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemo craft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell.": "虽然大多数血族猎人在他们的追求中走的是一条善良或中立的道路，但有些人已经堕落到血族工艺的黑暗、诱人的一面，将他们的能力用于自私和邪恶的目的。这些异类总是被赶出组织，并经常与他们曾经训练的生物一起被猎杀。",
	"You can make a Mech Pilot quickly by following these suggestions: First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Urchin background.Third, choose a crossbow, a dagger and the Explorer's pack.": "你可以通过以下建议快速成为一名机甲驾驶员。首先，智力应该是你的最高能力得分，其次是灵巧。第二，选择Urchin背景。第三，选择一把十字弓、一把匕首和探险家的背包。",

You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "你可以，作为一个行动，命令你的机械人喷射燃烧的燃料。在15英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。拯救失败时，这些生物会受到3d6的火焰伤害，拯救成功时，会受到一半的伤害。火焰会在角落里蔓延，并点燃该区域内任何没有被穿戴或携带的易燃物品。这个模块可以使用一次。在你完成长时间休息之前，你不能再这样做。",

	"You are proficient with poisons. Because of your chemical expertise, you were able to assemble a Poisoner's Kit, allowing you to create and replicate potent poisons. Your mech may, as an action, expel a cloud of noxious gas in a cone in front of it. This cone's size is equal to twice your Intelligence modifier + 5 feet. The cloud will persist until the end of your next round. Creatures being in or entering that cloud have to make a Constitution saving throw. On a fail, they take 1d12 poison damage and are poisoned for one minute. On a success, they take half that damage and are not poisoned. Poison gas can be used once.
