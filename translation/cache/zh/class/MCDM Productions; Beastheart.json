	"Erupting out of the sand on the back of a bulette, a half-orc leaps into the air. They cleave a path through armored skeletons with a greatsword while their mount charges in the opposite direction, leaving a cloud of powdered bone in their wake.": "一个半兽人骑在布莱特的背上从沙地里冲出来，跃入空中。他们用大剑在装甲的骷髅中劈出一条路，而他们的坐骑则向相反的方向冲去，在他们身后留下一团骨头粉末。",
	"A halfling flies over a burning forest on the back of a baby green dragon. The wyrmling sniffs the air and cries out, pointing with a claw to indicate a safe path to lead fearful forest creatures through the conflagration.": "一个半身人骑在一只绿龙宝宝的背上飞过一片燃烧的森林。狼人嗅着空气，大声叫喊，用爪子指着一条安全的路，引导恐惧的森林生物穿过大火。",
	"Sneaking upside down next to their giant spider companion, a half-elf's web-covered feet keep them securely attached to a cavern ceiling. The bandits below have no idea that their camp has been infiltrated, and that their days of attacking local settlements are at an end.": "在他们的巨型蜘蛛同伴旁边倒着溜达，半精灵覆盖着网的脚让他们牢牢地贴在洞穴的天花板上。下面的强盗们不知道他们的营地已经被渗透了，他们攻击当地定居点的日子已经到头了。",
	"A beastheart is an adventurer who forms a bond of friendship with a wild creature, and who draws power from that bond as it strengthens over time. Working as a team, a beastheart and their faithful companion can take on even the most dangerous adventures, challenging any monsters and overcoming any obstacles.": "野兽之心是一个冒险家，他与一个野生动物形成了友谊的纽带，并且随着时间的推移，他从这种纽带中获得了力量。作为一个团队，兽心人和他们忠实的伙伴可以进行最危险的冒险，挑战任何怪物，克服任何障碍。",
	"The connection a beastheart and a companion share isn't just one of love and admiration. It's a mystical bond that allows the beastheart to harness their companion's fury, might, and instincts for survival. When their companion is enraged, a beastheart channels that ferocity into supernatural deeds of martial prowess. In return, the wild companion can harness the beastheart's focus and direction.": "兽心和同伴之间的联系不仅仅是爱和敬佩的关系。它是一种神秘的纽带，使兽心人能够利用他们同伴的愤怒、力量和生存本能。当他们的同伴被激怒时，兽心会将这种凶猛的力量转化为超自然的武术行为。作为回报，野生伴侣可以利用兽心的注意力和方向。",
	"This supernatural kinship can form over a long period of time. Some beasthearts bond with unorthodox pets or wild protectors as children, becoming ever closer as both grow up together. Other beasthearts come of age in the wilderness, raised among wild creatures—or even raised by them—as a means of learning to respect and embrace the might of nature. But the beastheart bond can also form more quickly, typically in times of great duress. A person lost and starving in the wild might become a beastheart when they connect with a creature that saves their life by providing food and shelter Or a wild creature injured and beset by poachers can befriend a character who saves their life, with the creature's gratitude forging the beastheart bond.": "这种超自然的亲属关系可以在很长一段时间内形成。有些兽人在孩童时期就与非正统的宠物或野生保护者结合在一起，随着双方的成长而变得越来越亲密。其他兽心人在荒野中长大，在野生动物中长大，甚至被它们养大，以此来学习尊重和拥抱大自然的力量。但兽心的纽带也可以更快形成，通常是在面临巨大压力的时候。一个在野外迷路和挨饿的人，当他们与一个通过提供食物和庇护所而拯救他们生命的生物联系在一起时，就可能成为兽心。或者，一个受伤并被偷猎者围困的野生生物可以与一个拯救他们生命的角色交好，而这个生物的感激之情也会促成兽心的结合。",
	"Not every person is cut out to become a beastheart, just as not every animal is meant to be a companion. The pair must share an innate wildness and an unwavering trust in order to form this rare fellowship.": "不是每个人都能成为兽心，就像不是每个动物都能成为同伴一样。两人必须拥有与生俱来的野性和坚定不移的信任，才能形成这种罕见的友谊。",
	"Most beasthearts have no desire to fully tame their wild friends, for doing so would rob beloved companions of their personalities and fighting spirit. Instead, a beastheart views themself as a caregiver, looking after a companion whose heart is as fierce and open as their own. The companion shares a similar view, thinking of their beastheart as a member of the pack, and treating a caregiver as a sibling always ready to explore, hunt, and play.": "大多数兽心人并不希望完全驯服他们的野生朋友，因为这样做会剥夺心爱的同伴的个性和战斗精神。相反，兽心人把自己看作是一个照顾者，照顾一个和自己的心一样猛烈和开放的伙伴。伴侣也有类似的观点，把他们的兽心当作群体的一员，把照顾者当作随时准备探索、狩猎和游戏的兄弟姐妹。",
	"To an outsider, a beastheart and a companion might appear to be equals (The companion most likely feels that way!) But the beastheart is always aware that their companion is a force of nature, not a domesticated creature. As such, a beastheart accepts that their companion might not be capable of deep introspection, as most companions live for the moment, dwell not on the past, and give little thought to the future. It's thus the beastheart's responsibility to do those things for themself and their wild friend, taking responsibility for a companion as a parent might care for a child, and grieving if the wild heart they've cared for is ever stilled.": "在外人看来，兽心人和同伴似乎是平等的（同伴很可能也这么认为！）但兽心人总是意识到，他们的同伴是一种自然力量，而不是一种被驯化的生物。因此，兽心人接受他们的同伴可能没有能力进行深刻的反省，因为大多数同伴都是活在当下，不纠结于过去，而且很少考虑到未来。因此，兽心人有责任为他们自己和他们的野生朋友做这些事情，对同伴负责，就像父母对孩子的关心一样，如果他们所关心的那颗野性的心曾经静止过，他们也会感到悲伤。",
	"Like the companions who stalk and explore at their sides, beasthearts bear a wondrous connection to the natural world, allowing them to track prey, survive in harsh environments, and get along even with wild creatures that aren't their companions. Many beasthearts are most at home in the wilderness, sleeping under the stars and enjoying the bounty of nature. Even when beasthearts and their companions make their lives in towns or cities, the untamed wilds beyond a settlement or the subterranean depths beneath it are often on their minds, constantly calling them to adventure.": "就像在他们身边跟踪和探索的同伴一样，野兽之心与自然界有着奇妙的联系，使他们能够追踪猎物，在恶劣的环境中生存，甚至与不是他们同伴的野生生物相处。许多兽灵在荒野中是最自在的，他们在星空下睡觉，享受大自然的恩赐。即使兽心人和他们的同伴在城镇中生活，他们的脑海中也常常浮现出定居点外的未被驯服的荒野或定居点下的地下深处，不断召唤他们去冒险。",
	"As you create your beastheart character, consider the history of your friendship with your companion. Did you fnd the creature as a child and grow up together? Or did you form a bond with them only recently? Is this the first companion you've had, and are you the first person to whom your companion has bonded in this way? Think about the moment you became friends and the trials you've already faced. You might have survived in the wilderness together while one of you was injured. You might have saved your companion from trophy hunters. Or your companion might have instead saved your life by fighting off a deadly enemy.": "当你创造你的兽心人物时，考虑你与你的同伴的友谊历史。你是在小时候发现了这个生物并一起长大的吗？还是你最近才与它们建立起联系？这是你的第一个同伴吗？你是第一个与你的同伴以这种方式结合的人吗？想一想你们成为朋友的时刻和你们已经面临的考验。你们可能一起在荒野中生存，而其中一个人受伤了。你可能从战利品猎人手中救了你的同伴。或者你的同伴可能反而因为击退了一个致命的敌人而救了你的命。",
	"Consider your companion's personality and tastes. Are they rambunctious or lazy? Standoffish or friendly? What tricks can you perform together? What is your companion's favorite food? You should also think about how your companion and you complement each other in looks or personality. Does your appearance reflect or contrast theirs? What activities do you both enjoy? How do you communicate with your companion? And how do you encourage others to communicate with and show respect for your friend?": "考虑你的同伴的个性和品味。他们是粗野的还是懒惰的？孤僻还是友好？你们可以一起表演什么技巧？你的伴侣最喜欢的食物是什么？你还应该考虑你的伴侣和你在外表或性格上如何互补。你的外貌与他们的外貌是相映成趣还是形成对比？你们都喜欢什么活动？你如何与你的伴侣沟通？你又是如何鼓励他人与你的朋友沟通并表示尊重的？",
	"You can make a beastheart quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score (or Strength if you want to use a melee weapon), followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the outlander background.": "你可以通过以下建议快速制作一个兽心。首先，让灵巧成为你最高的能力得分（如果你想使用近战武器，则是力量），其次是智慧。第二，选择外乡人的背景。",
	"At 1st level, you gain a companion creature that accompanies you on your adventures, fighting, exploring, and living alongside you. You can choose any companion in this supplement or other MCDM supplements. You might also find some cool companions on the MCDM subreddit and in the MCDM Discord server. The Companions section has information on fifteen companion creatures you can choose for your beastheart, and information on the rules for using companions (including ferocity and entering a rampage).": "在1级时，你获得一个同伴生物，在你的冒险中陪伴你，与你一起战斗、探索和生活。你可以选择本补编或其他MCDM补编中的任何同伴。你也可以在MCDM子论坛和MCDM Discord服务器中找到一些很酷的同伴。同伴部分有关于你可以为你的兽心选择的15种同伴生物的信息，以及关于使用同伴的规则的信息（包括凶猛和进入狂暴状态）。",
	"Your supernatural connection to your companion binds their life to yours, allowing you to help your companion overcome even the most grievous injuries. If your companion has lost hit points or is dead, you can spend 1 minute meditating on your companion's spirit. The companion then regains all their hit points and returns to life if they were dead, and you gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}. If the companion's body was destroyed, they reform within 5 feet of you.": "你与同伴的超自然联系将他们的生命与你的生命联系在一起，使你能够帮助你的同伴克服最严重的伤痛。如果你的同伴失去了生命值或已经死亡，你可以花1分钟时间对你同伴的灵魂进行冥想。然后同伴就会恢复所有的命中率，如果他们已经死了，就会恢复生命，而你会获得一个等级的（%0%）。如果同伴的身体被摧毁，他们会在你的5英尺范围内进行改造。",
	"The first time you finish a long rest after you gain a level in this class, you can bond with a new companion of your choice, which arrives in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you in a manner determined by the GM. If you already have a companion from this feature, they leave to be on their own when the new companion arrives.": "在你获得该等级的等级后，第一次完成长时休息，你可以与你选择的一个新同伴结合，该同伴以GM决定的方式到达你身边5英尺内的一个无人空间。如果你已经有了这个功能的同伴，那么当新同伴到达时，他们就会离开，自生自灭。",
	"From 1st level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with your companion, as well as with all Beasts and Monstrosities. This feature doesn't allow you to communicate complex thoughts or questions, but you can make simple statements (such as showing other creatures you mean them no harm) or ask simple questions (such as the location of the nearest body of water, or if a specific individual with a unique look passed through the area recently). The knowledge and awareness of such creatures is limited by their intellect, and the GM determines if a particular creature is in a communicative mood. While speaking with a Beast or Monstrosity using this feature, you can make Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks in place of Charisma checks to influence the creature.": "从1级开始，你可以理解并与你的同伴以及所有野兽和怪兽进行口头交流。这个功能不允许你交流复杂的思想或问题，但你可以做简单的陈述（比如向其他生物表明你对它们没有恶意）或问一些简单的问题（比如最近的水体的位置，或者最近是否有一个具有独特外观的特定个体经过这个地区）。这类生物的知识和意识受到它们智力的限制，而GM则决定一个特定的生物是否有交流的心情。在与使用此功能的野兽或怪兽交谈时，你可以用智慧（动物处理）检查代替魅力检查来影响该生物。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you learn to channel your companion's fury into extraordinary deeds called primal exploits, which are fueled by your companion's ferocity.": "从2级开始，你学会将你的同伴的愤怒引导到被称为 \"原始探索 \"的非凡行为中，这些行为由你的同伴的凶猛所推动。",
	"You learn three primal exploits of your choice, detailed below. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the primal exploits you know and replace it with another primal exploit, for which you must have the appropriate beastheart level.": "你学会了三种你选择的原始利用，详情如下。每当你在这个等级中获得一个等级，你可以从你所知道的原始利用中选择一个，并用另一个原始利用来代替它，为此你必须拥有相应的兽心等级。",
	"Some exploits are activated using your reaction. Others are usable under specific circumstances but require no action. Some exploits are activated as part of the Attack action, in which case, you can use only one such exploit per turn.": "有些漏洞是用你的反应激活的。其他的则是在特定情况下可以使用，但不需要行动。有些漏洞是作为攻击行动的一部分被激活的，在这种情况下，你每回合只能使用一个这样的漏洞。",
	"All exploits require you to spend your companion's ferocity to use them. Your companion must be within 60 feet of you when you use an exploit, and must have ferocity at least equal to the exploit's cost. The companion loses ferocity equal to the cost when you use the exploit. You can use an exploit even if your companion is {@condition unconscious}, as long as they have the appropriate ferocity. You can't use an exploit while your companion has entered a rampage.": "所有的漏洞都需要你花费你同伴的力量来使用它们。当你使用漏洞时，你的同伴必须在你的60英尺范围内，并且必须拥有至少与漏洞成本相等的凶猛程度。当你使用漏洞时，同伴会失去与成本相等的力量。即使你的同伴是（%0%），你也可以使用漏洞，只要他们有适当的凶猛程度。当你的同伴已经进入狂暴状态时，你不能使用漏洞。",
