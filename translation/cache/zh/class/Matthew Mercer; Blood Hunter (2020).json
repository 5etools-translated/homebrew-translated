	"Marred but resolute, his grimacing face dripping with sweat, a half-orc reddens a finger across his wounds to draw a glowing, ruby glyph in the air. He grips the weightless, completed sigil, twisting it to unleash dark magical energies that fire forward, cursing the stalking behemoth from within its own veins to better even the odds.": "一个半兽人伤痕累累，但意志坚定，他面无表情的脸上滴着汗水，用手指在伤口上涂红，在空中画出一个发光的红宝石字形。他握住这个没有重量的、已经完成的符文，扭动它释放出黑暗的魔法能量，向前方发射，从它自己的血管里诅咒那只被跟踪的巨兽，以更好地扳回局面。",
	"A mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates a grizzly scene off the roadway, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the massacre.The survivor who warily hired her with draws with a jump as the half-elf suddenly shoots to her feet, sure in the knowledge of the culprit, where it calls home, and how little time there is to find it.": "一个神秘的半精灵披着破旧的斗篷和坚固的皮甲，小心翼翼地调查着路边的灰熊现场，当她沉思着大屠杀的残余时，她的眼睛里闪过一丝认同。当半精灵突然站起来时，那个战战兢兢地雇用她的幸存者跳了起来，她确信知道罪魁祸首，它的家在哪里，以及找到它的时间有多短。",
	"Stepping into the lightless chambers of ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling's nose picks up the pungent smell of imminent danger as she hears the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting her blood into glowing runes of powerful magic, her sword suddenly engulfed in arcane flames, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.": "踏入无光的古尘室，听到附近石头上的骨头和爪子的摩擦声，半身人的鼻子闻到了危险即将来临的刺鼻气味。当她的刀在她的手掌上划过时，她感到害怕，钢铁将她的血液转化为强大魔法的发光符文，她的剑突然被神秘的火焰所吞噬，渴望烙印和燃烧她敌人的肉体。",
	"Often feared or misunderstood, and driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt to better stalk and survive their prey. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they choose to hunt.": "猎血者往往被人畏惧或误解，并被一种消灭邪恶的无尽动力所驱使，他们是聪明的、神秘的战士，他们将自己的本质与他们猎杀的黑暗生物结合在一起，以便更好地跟踪猎物并使其生存。他们以禁忌的血魔法仪式为武器，愿意为事业牺牲自己的生命力和人性，从阴影中保护王国，时刻保持警惕，避免成为他们选择猎杀的怪物。",
	"While most of the classic schools of magical study are well known and widely respected, the less refined and macabre incantations of Hemocraft have long been forbidden and lost to most of the civilized world. Blood Hunters have reclaimed these techniques away from the judging eyes of society, finding blood magic's esoteric nature effective against the evils that often defy the divine powers that historically hold the line.": "虽然大多数经典的魔法研究流派都是众所周知的，并受到广泛的尊重，但血魔法的不太精致和可怕的咒语长期以来一直被禁止，并被大多数文明世界所遗忘。猎血人在远离社会评判的目光下重新获得了这些技术，他们发现血魔法的神秘性可以有效地对抗那些经常藐视历史上把持的神圣力量的邪恶。",
	"Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes.": "通过仔细的研究和实践，血族猎人已经将血液工艺的仪式磨练成了他们的战斗力，放弃了他们健康的一个方面，为他们的武器注入强大的血液魔法，并召唤元素来笼罩他们的攻击。",
	"They can sear an arcane brand into the body of their quarry that hinders their foe's abilities and punishes their aggression, or call blood curses upon their enemies, manipulating their bodies from the inside. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.": "他们可以在猎物的身体上烙下奥术烙印，阻碍敌人的能力，惩罚他们的侵略行为，或者对敌人发出血腥的诅咒，从内部操纵他们的身体。为了取得胜利，他们愿意承受任何代价，这些精明的战士将自己锻造成一股强大的力量，对抗威胁无辜者的恐怖。",
	"Whether driven by the wish to make a difference in a dangerous world, the need to take vengeance for a great wrong they have suffered, being inspired by witnessing the strange and powerful techniques of another blood hunter in person, or just seeking a place to belong in an uncaring world, the reasons one may take up the Hunter's Bane and choose this life are many and varied. In joining an order of blood hunters, one is also joining a tight family bound by service to each other and the common cause. For many, this is the only family they have known or have left, so the kinship felt between members of an order is a bond neigh unbreakable.": "无论是出于在危险的世界中有所作为的愿望，还是为自己所遭受的巨大损失进行复仇的需要，或是因为亲眼目睹了另一个血族猎人的奇怪而强大的技术而受到启发，或者只是在一个无情的世界中寻求一个归属的地方，一个人可能拿起猎人之刃并选择这种生活的原因是多种多样的。在加入血族猎人组织的过程中，人们也加入了一个紧密的家庭，彼此之间的服务和共同的事业联系在一起。对许多人来说，这是他们唯一知道的或已经离开的家庭，因此，骑士团成员之间的亲情是一种几乎牢不可破的纽带。",
	"Beyond the boundaries of the order, however, the life of a blood hunter is often not an easy one. The rituals of the Hunter's Bane regularly leave one visibly changed and prone to unsettle common folk, and the witnessing of hemocraft can invoke a superstitious fear from even the most learned scholar. While some societies have come to accept the good deeds of the orders, many blood hunters publicly hide their nature unless absolutely necessary, feeling more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world where the Orders commonly train. Even so, the best work a blood hunter can do usually involves the poor and defenseless on the outskirts of society, those prone to the corrupting touch of fiends and dark intension. Braving the threat of vilification, these dark protectors wade through civilization, earning coin as mercenaries or bounty hunters, ever watching for the signs of something more nefarious beneath the surface.": "然而，在教团的边界之外，猎血人的生活往往并不轻松。猎人之刃的仪式经常使人明显改变，容易使普通人感到不安，而目睹血手艺的人甚至会引起最博学的学者的迷信恐惧。虽然有些社会已经接受了骑士团的善行，但许多血族猎人除非有必要，否则会公开隐藏自己的本性，在骑士团经常训练的荒野和废墟中感到更加舒适。即便如此，血族猎人能做的最好的工作通常涉及社会边缘的穷人和无助者，那些容易受到恶魔和黑暗意图腐蚀的人。冒着被诋毁的威胁，这些黑暗的保护者在文明中游走，作为雇佣兵或赏金猎人赚取钱财，时刻注意着表面下更邪恶的东西的迹象。",
	"In choosing this path, a blood hunter has irrevocably given a part of themselves to their cause, physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. The orders of blood hunters practice their own unique ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of these guardians. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle, so a life of discipline and vigilance drives their travels as they wander the country side in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.": "在选择这条道路时，猎血者已经不可逆转地将自己的一部分献给了他们的事业，包括身体上、情感上，有时还有道德上。猎血者的组织实行他们自己独特的理想和方法，经常采用具有黑暗起源的技术，考验这些守护者的力量和意志。许多人与失去这场斗争的恐惧搏斗，所以纪律和警惕的生活驱使他们在乡间游荡，寻找志同道合的冒险者和黑暗行动的耳语。",
	"As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?": "当你创造一个血腥的猎人时，你的角色最重要的方面是你为什么被驱使到这种生活方式，以及你为什么寻求放弃一切，与你所猎杀的恶魔一起沉湎于黑暗之中？你是否在邪恶的野兽面前失去了亲人，现在希望防止其他人遭受同样的命运？你是否寻求一种目标和安全感，并在接纳你的秩序中找到了这种感觉？你是否一直带着黑暗的种子，并寻求亲属来看护你，防止你屈服于它？你是否曾经是一名神圣的战士，但却偏离了他的信仰而被驱逐出去，但仍然寻求为保护无辜者的事业奉献自己？或者你是一个有着黑暗过去的罪犯，寻求弥补，把这一生作为忏悔的道路？",
	"What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises to grant you as you step closer to its mastery? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?": "你与血脉的力量和它承诺在你接近它的掌握时授予你的能力是什么关系？你是否尊重和惧怕涌动在你血管中的古老力量，只在必要时使用它们？你是否对它提供给你的力量津津乐道，拥抱你的天赋并自由使用它们？你是否担心迷信是正确的，这种力量最终会把你变成你猎杀的怪物之一？或者，你的学习已经给你灌输了心灵控制物质的自信，确信你可以弯曲这些天赋，带来更光明的曙光？",
	"Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?": "也要考虑到，虽然血族猎人属于一个教团，但许多人自己出击，做他们最好的工作。是什么让你离开了舒适的教团？你是否打算回来，或者你决定在外面的世界里有更多的东西要学？你在其他冒险者身上寻找什么，可以帮助你实现你的目标？",
	"While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemo craft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell.": "虽然大多数血族猎人在他们的追求中走的是一条善良或中立的道路，但有些人已经堕落到血族工艺的黑暗、诱人的一面，将他们的能力用于自私和邪恶的目的。这些异类总是被赶出组织，并经常与他们曾经训练的生物一起被猎杀。",
	"You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons, or archery (or finesse weapons). Make Intelligence your next highest if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical power. Choose a higher Constitution next, as you want to have extra hit points to burn on your crimson rite or amplifying blood curses. Then, select the {@background urchin} or {@background soldier} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一个血族猎人。首先，根据你是想专注于近战武器，还是射箭（或精巧的武器），将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分。如果你打算专注于血腥诅咒和神秘力量的效力，那么智力就是你的第二高分。接下来选择一个较高的体质，因为你想有额外的命中率来燃烧你的深红仪式或放大血咒的效果。然后，选择（%0%）或（%1%）的背景。",

Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, overtime, become something beyond what they once were. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant. Researching their targets to know their strengths and weaknesses, these blood hunters can alter their biology to be best prepared for the coming conflict.": "猎人之刃的过程是一个痛苦、伤痕累累，有时甚至是致命的经历。那些幸存下来的人发现自己已经发生了不可逆转的改变，得到了增强。一些人发现这种经历令人振奋，他们接受了通过血液工艺和腐败的炼金术的组合来改变自己的生理结构的能力。经过几代人的实验，一个由血液猎手组成的小团体开始出现，他们专注于酿造有毒的灵药来改变他们的战斗能力，改变他们的血液，并随着时间的推移，成为超越他们曾经是什么的东西。他们称自己为 \"突变者\"。研究他们的目标，了解他们的长处和弱点，这些血液猎手可以改变他们的生物学，为即将到来的冲突做最好的准备。",

	"Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy.
