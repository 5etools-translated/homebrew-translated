While taking a long rest, creatures who spend at least half of the time required for their rest around the mortar gain an amount of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Titan's level+Constitution modifier. These hit points last for 24 hours or until another long rest is taken.": "在野营时，你的迫击炮可以作为篝火的替代品，满足篝火的所有需求。在长时间休息时，在迫击炮周围花费至少一半的休息时间的生物会获得相当于泰坦等级+构架修改器的临时命中率。这些命中率会持续24小时，或者直到再次进行长时休息。",
