If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time.\"": "一个大兽人被甩过房间，砸穿了桌子和椅子，然后在雷鸣般的撞击中撞到了墙上，昏昏沉沉地倒下了。一个人类，她的眼睛闪耀着不食人间烟火的力量，在吧台上抛出几个额外的硬币。\"对不起，搞得一团糟。如果他醒过来，告诉他下次试着找一个和他一样大的人。\"",
	"The prisoner's expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely states at him silenetly.

	"\"Ain't you... cold or somethin'?\" the dwarf asks the elf as they trude through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. \"I just think 'warm',\" the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... she hasn't frozen to death yet. \"Say, could you think some 'warm' this way?\" the dwarf asks hopefully.

	"Since a psion's weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, least their powers run amok. This leads many of them developing odd behvaiors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.": "由于灵媒的武器是他们的思想，他们总是一不小心就会伤害到他们周围的人。对于一个灵媒来说，思考和行动之间的界限可能很细，迫使他们控制自己的思想和情绪，以免他们的力量失控。这导致他们中的许多人发展出奇怪的行为或举止，以帮助他们控制自己的思想状态，在外部观察者看来经常是非常古怪的。",
	"Consider how {@italic your} psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits.

A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.": "通常是那些{@italic do}了解魔法的人发现灵媒的能力最反常。一种与魔法编织相交而不是服从它的力量，灵媒所拥有的力量的本质只能让人不安地思考。",

	"A psion's constant internal struggle can lead psions to developing odd quirks or habits that they have unintentionally developed to keep their powers under control.

	"An Unleashed Psion's power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results.

	"At 11th level, you gain the ability to exert great feats of psionic power. Choose one {@filter 6th-level spell from the Psion spell list|spells|level=6|class=psion} as an innate ability. You can use this innate ability to cast that spell once. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Innate Psionics when you finish a long rest.": "在11级时，你获得了施展巨大幻术力量的能力。选择一个（%0%）作为先天能力。你可以使用这个先天能力来施展一次该法术。你必须在完成长时间的休息后才能再次这样做。在更高的等级，你会获得更多你所选择的可以这样使用的先天能力：在13级时获得一个7级法术，15级时获得一个8级法术，17级时获得一个9级法术。当你完成一次长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有的先天幻术的使用。",
	"When you reach 18th level, you can select a third psionic discipline from the list of {@filter psionic disciplines|optionalfeatures|feature type=PsiD}. You can't select a discipline you already know. You gain all features of a psionic discipline when selecting it.": "当你达到18级时，你可以从（%0%）的列表中选择第三个幻术学科。你不能选择一个你已经知道的修行。在选择一个幻术学科时，你会获得该学科的所有特征。",
	"Starting at 20th level, if you die you can choose to become an incorporeal entity on the Border Ethereal at the spot you died in the Material Plane at the start of your next turn.

	"When you take this form your current and maximum hit points becomes that of the {@creature ghost} while you are in the form, if you have less than 10 psi points when you would assume this form, you have 10 psi points. While in this form you can't rest to regain spent abilities. If you exhaust all Psi Points or the  {@creature ghost} is destroyed, you die as a normal creature would.": "当你采取这种形式时，你当前的和最大的命中率会变成你处于这种形式时的（%0%），如果你将采取这种形式时，你的psi点数少于10，你就有10psi点数。当你处于这种形态时，你不能休息以恢复已消耗的能力。如果你用尽了所有的psi点数或者{@creature ghost}被摧毁，你会像普通生物一样死亡。",
	"An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the realms beyond in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.": "觉醒的心灵是一个因遭遇、事件或环境而被唤醒了他们的幻觉力量的灵媒。也许他们的力量是潜在的，也许他们的命运一直是普通生物，直到力量突然被推到他们身上。也许他们在一个生动的梦中看到了外面的世界，也许他们徘徊在仙境中，回来时已经扭曲了，也许他们只是瞥见了走在街上的一个不属于他们的生物的眼睛。",
	"An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest—telepathy— is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.": "觉醒通常是有些创伤性的。幻觉者并没有被很好地理解，他们表现出来的第一种能力--遥感，是最令人恐惧和回避的能力之一。",

	"Starting at 3rd level, when you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).": "从3级开始，当你使用心灵感应入侵时，你可以强迫目标进行智力救赎，而不是智慧救赎来对抗这个能力（决定你何时使用这个能力）。",
	"When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack or use the power).": "当一个生物对你的 \"心灵感应入侵 \"的救赎失败时，你获得一个D4。直到你的下一个回合结束，如果你对该生物进行攻击卷，或者该生物对你的幻术力量（除心灵感应入侵外）进行蓄力投掷，你可以从卷中加上或减去这个d4（在你进行攻击或使用力量之前决定卷）。",

	"Starting at 10th level, you can see a creature by its mind. You gain a mindsight of 60 feet, allowing you to see creatures with an Intelligence of 6 or higher within range as if by blindsight. A creature you are unaware of can still be hidden from you, but you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier when making Perception checks to detect creatures.": "从10级开始，你可以通过生物的思想看到它。你获得了60英尺的心灵视线，使你能够看到范围内智力为6或更高的生物，就像用盲视一样。你不知道的生物仍然可以被你隐藏起来，但是你在进行感知检查以探测生物时，可以使用你的智力修正值而不是智慧修正值。",

At the start of your turn, you can expend 2 psi points to gain advantage on all saving throws and attack rolls until the start of your next turn.": "从14级开始，你可以短暂地完全唤醒你膨胀的心灵，使之真正理解。在你的回合开始时，你可以消耗2个psi点来获得所有蓄力和攻击卷的优势，直到你下一个回合开始。",
	"An Unleashed Mind's power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.": "一个被释放的心灵的力量往往是一种与生俱来的力量，他们努力去理解或控制，是他们的心态和情绪投射到周围世界的反映，往往会造成毁灭性的结果。一个被释放的幻觉者的生活经常是他们控制自己不规则的力量的旅程......或者是完全拥抱破坏性力量的旅程。",
	"What the wellspring of their innate power is varies: they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.": "他们与生俱来的力量的源泉各不相同：他们可能是一个幻象种族，在遥远的扭曲力量的影响下出生，被精灵的血液扭曲，或者是更邪恶的东西刷新了物质世界的预兆。有时，他们的力量会在简单的应用中显示出来，但最常见的情况是，当他们的脾气爆发时，他们的力量就会变得众所周知和令人畏惧。",
	"Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken. An Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.": "他们的取向经常取决于他们对自己的力量所采取的方法。一个强调控制和克制的释放型灵媒，使他们的情绪不至于失控，他们的力量不至于猖獗，往往是合法的，遵循严格的个人准则。另一方面，一个让自己的力量横行的释放者几乎总是混乱的，冲动行事......而且非常强调。",

	"Transcended Psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come to understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other Psions may have. Unfortunately less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Transcended Psion as a bit... peculiar.": "超越者往往在控制和原则方面对他们的能力有最好的把握，他们已经理解了更大的宇宙，但缺乏其他一些超越者可能有的鲁莽的放弃。不幸的是，不那么超然的头脑经常不能理解他们所学到的更大的真理，并可能认为超然的幻术有点......奇特。",

The maximum value of the pool is your psion level, and any points beyond the maximum are lost. The next time you make a damage roll, you can expend the pool to add damage equal to the stored value to one target affected by the damage roll. This stored damage is lost if not spent within 1 minute.": "从第三级开始，当你使用幻术能力（力量或咒语）来恢复命中率或授予临时命中率时，你可以将授予的同等命中率加到一个储存池中。这个池子的最大值是你的幻术等级，任何超过最大值的点数都会丢失。在你下次进行伤害卷的时候，你可以消耗这个池子，对一个受伤害卷影响的目标增加相当于储存值的伤害。如果在1分钟内没有花费，这个储存的伤害会消失。",

	"The exact nature of what psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be.
