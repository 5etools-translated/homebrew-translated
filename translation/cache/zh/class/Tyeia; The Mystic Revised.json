	"A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.": "幻术天赋是你所掌握的一种小型幻术效果。一级时，你知道一个你选择的幻术天赋。在更高等级时，你会学习更多你选择的天赋。神秘人表格的 \"已知天赋 \"一栏显示了你在每个等级所知道的天赋总数；当这个数字对你来说上升时，你可以选择一个新天赋。",
	"A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.": "幻术修炼是一套严格的精神练习，使神秘主义者能够表现出幻术力量。一个神秘主义者一次只能掌握几种修炼方法。",

	"You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.": "你有一个内部能量库，可以用于你知道的幻术学科。这种能量用psi点数来表示。每个幻术学科都描述了你可以通过花费一定数量的psi点来创造的效果。幻术天赋不需要psi点数。",
	"The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.": "你拥有的psi点数是基于你的神秘主义等级，如神秘主义表格中psi点数一栏所示。你的等级所显示的数字是你的psi点最大值。当你完成长期休息时，你的psi点总数会恢复到最大值。你拥有的psi点数不能低于0，也不能超过你的最大值。",
	"Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.": "虽然你可以获得大量的幻术能量，但需要训练和练习来引导这些能量。你可以花费的psi点数是有限制的，以激活一种幻术修炼。这个限制是基于你的神秘主义等级，如神秘主义表格的Psi Limit栏所示。例如，作为一个3级的神秘主义者，无论你有多少psi点数，你每次使用一项修行所花费的psi点数不能超过3。",

	"Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.": "每种幻术都有几种使用方法，都包含在其描述中。纪律规定了行动的类型和它所需要的psi点的数量。它还详细说明了你是否必须专注于它的效果，它影响多少个目标，它需要什么样的救赎，诸如此类。",
	"The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.": "下面的章节将详细介绍如何使用修行。幻术是魔法，其功能类似于法术。",
	"You can only use the effects of a discipline if you are focusing on it. You can choose what disciplines you are focusing on from the list of disciplines known at the end of a short rest.": "你只有在专注于某一学科时才能使用该学科的效果。你可以在短时休息结束后，从已知的学科列表中选择你所关注的学科。",
	"At 1st Level, you can only focus on one discipline at a time. This increases to 2 disciplines at a time at 5th level, 3 disciplines at a time at 13th level and 4 disciplines at a time at 18th level.": "在1级时，你一次只能专注于一个学科。5级时增加到一次2个学科，13级时一次3个学科，18级时一次4个学科。",
	"The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.": "一门学科的通灵焦点部分描述了当你选择该学科作为你的通灵焦点时获得的好处。",
	"A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.": "一门学科提供了不同的选择，可以用你的psi点数来使用它。每个效果选项都有一个名称，该选项的psi点成本出现在其名称后面的括号内。你必须花费该数量的psi点来使用该选项，同时遵守你的psi限制。如果你没有足够的psi点数，或者费用超过你的psi上限，你就不能使用该选项。",
	"Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.": "有些选项显示了psi点数的范围，而不是具体的费用。要使用该选项，你必须在该点数范围内花费一定数量的点数，但仍要遵守你的psi限制。有些选项让你花费额外的psi点数来增加一个学科的效力。同样，你必须遵守你的psi限制，而且你必须在第一次使用该学科时花费所有的点数；你不能在看到该学科的运作时再决定花费额外的点数。",
	"Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.": "每个选项都注明了关于其效果的具体信息，包括使用它所需要的任何行动和它的范围。",
	"Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.": "纪律不需要像许多法术那样的组件。使用一种修炼方法不需要说话、手势或材料。幻术的力量来自于心灵。",
	"An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.": "一个学科中的效果选项规定了其效果持续的时间。",
	"If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.": "如果没有指定持续时间，该选项的效果是瞬时的。",
	"Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with \"conc.\" after the option's psi point cost. The \"conc.\" notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says \"conc., 1 min.,\" you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute.": "有些选项需要集中精力来维持其效果。这种要求在选项的psi点成本之后用 \"conc. \"来表示。Conc. \"后面是浓缩的最大持续时间。例如，如果一个选项上写着 \"集中，1分钟\"，那么你可以集中其效果长达1分钟。",
	"Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See {@book chapter 10|PHB|10}, \"Spellcasting,\" in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.": "专注于一个学科的规则与专注于一个法术的规则相同。这个规则意味着你不能同时专注于一个咒语和一个修行，也不能同时专注于两个修行。关于集中精力的工作原理，请参见《玩家手册》中的（%0%），\"施法\"。",

	"If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.": "如果一项纪律要求救赎，它规定了救赎的类型以及救赎成功或失败的结果。蓄力是由你的幻术能力决定的。",
	"Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.": "有些纪律要求你做一个攻击卷，以确定纪律的效果是否击中其目标。攻击卷使用你的幻术能力。",
	"The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect—applies while the durations of the effects overlap.": "不同幻术的效果相加，而这些幻术的持续时间也会重叠。同样地，如果一个幻术学科的不同选项同时激活，它们也会合并。然而，如果一个幻术学科的特定选项被多次使用，则该选项不会与自身结合。相反，最有力的效果--通常取决于有多少psi点被用来创造效果--会在效果的持续时间重叠的时候适用。",
	"Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule.": "幻术和法术是独立的效果，因此它们的好处和坏处是重叠的。重现法术的幻术效果是这个规则的例外。",
	"At 1st level, you choose a Mystic Order from the list of available orders. Each order specializes in a specific approach to psionics.": "在1级时，你从可用的命令列表中选择一个神秘的命令。每个教团都专注于一种特定的幻术方法。",

	"At 2nd level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.": "在第2级时，你的心灵唤醒了通过心灵感应进行交流的能力。你可以用这种方式与你周围120英尺内的任何生物进行心灵感应。你不需要与该生物共享一种语言，它就能理解你的心灵感应信息，但该生物必须能理解至少一种语言，或者本身就有心灵感应。",

	"Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.": "从第4级开始，每当你完成短期或长期休息时，你可以替换你对智慧救赎的熟练程度。要这样做，请选择力量、灵巧、体质或魅力。你会获得使用该能力而不是智慧的救赎的熟练度。这个变化一直持续到你完成下一次短休或长休。",

	"At 10th level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your physical durability in exchange for psionic power. When activating a psionic discipline, you can pay its psi point cost with your hit points, instead of using any psi points. Your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This reduction can't be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.": "在10级时，你获得了牺牲你的身体耐久力来换取幻术能力的能力。当激活一个幻术学科时，你可以用你的命中率来支付其psi点成本，而不是使用任何psi点。你当前的命中率和最大命中率都会因你所花费的命中率而降低。这种减少不能以任何方式减少，而且对你的最大命中率的减少会持续到你完成一次长时休息。",

	"Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines.
