	"The masked man takes one arrow to the chest. Then another. Despite the beating he is taking, he simply won't go down. Suddenly, he leaps towards his attacker and takes flight, leaving a crater in the ground where he stood. Once he grabs ahold of his opponent, he lifts them and throws them into a nearby wall. He picks up the bandit's bow and snaps it in half before turning to greet his adoring fans.": "蒙面人胸部中了一箭。然后是另一支。尽管他正在遭受殴打，但他根本不会倒下。突然，他跳向他的攻击者并飞了起来，在他站立的地面上留下一个坑。一旦他抓住了他的对手，他就把他们举起来，扔到附近的墙上。他拿起强盗的弓，把它折成两半，然后转身向他的崇拜者致意。",
