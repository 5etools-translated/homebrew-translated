	"An elven woman strides calmly through a forest glade, smirking as she subtly grips her sheathed blade. She closes her eyes as brigands leap from the surrounding brush. Before they can even shout their demands, the woman's blade makes a wide arc at the group. Each brigand manages to barely dodge her preemptive strike, but their movements suddenly stop as they start to draw their blades. A large wound appears across each of their torsos where her blade had grazed them, and then they slump to the ground.": "一个精灵女子平静地穿过森林绿荫，一边笑着一边巧妙地握着出鞘的刀。当强盗们从周围的灌木丛中跳出来时，她闭上了眼睛。在他们还没来得及喊出他们的要求时，这个女人的刀就在这群人身上划出了一个大弧度。每个强盗都设法勉强躲过她的先发制人的一击，但他们的动作突然停止，因为他们开始拔刀。在她的刀刃擦过的地方，他们每个人的躯体上都出现了一个大伤口，然后他们瘫倒在地。",
	"Atop a grassy plateau, a lone human figure stands in total focus amidst a swarm of hovering spectral blades. Like a masterful conductor, the figure directs the blades to fluidly strike the targets painted on the stones around. With a quiet whisper of pride, the figure recalls the blades before willing them to fall to dust and blow away with the wind.": "在一个长满草的高原上，一个孤独的人影站在一群盘旋的幽灵刀中，全神贯注。就像一个高超的指挥家，这个人物指挥着刀片流畅地攻击周围石头上的目标。伴随着骄傲的低语，这个人影回忆起这些刀片，然后愿意让它们落入灰尘，随风飘散。",
	"A battle rages upon a blood-soaked field overlooked by a regal keep. In its center, stands a lone battle-worn tiefling fighting for his life. A pair of hulking spectral arms sprout from his back, allowing the tiefling to wield four axes at once. He charges into a group of soldiers, wreathing himself in flames as the lone figure carves into the enemy line. Each step taken could be his last, yet the tiefling fights with the widest of grins.": "一场战斗在一个被鲜血浸透的场地上激烈地进行着，而这个场地被一个高贵的城堡所俯瞰。在战斗的中心，站着一个孤独的、饱经战火的铁皮人在为自己的生命而战。一对巨大的幽灵手臂从他的背上伸出来，让这个铁皮人可以同时挥舞四把斧头。他冲向一群士兵，当这个孤独的身影切入敌人的阵营时，他用火焰包裹着自己。每一步都可能是他的最后一步，但这个铁皮人却带着最灿烂的笑容战斗。",
	"Although these warriors fight using a diverse range of extraordinary methods, they are all disciples. Disciples are defined by their mystical fighting styles and the introspective focus that gives purpose to their training. For a disciple, combat is a conduit of self-improvement, and battlefields exist to test the strength of ideals.": "虽然这些战士使用各种不同的非凡方法作战，但他们都是门徒。门徒的定义是他们神秘的战斗风格和赋予其训练目的的内省焦点。对弟子来说，战斗是自我完善的渠道，而战场的存在是为了检验理想的力量。",
	"The key to a disciple's magic prowess is awareness and focus. Every movement a creature makes causes a small, nearly imperceptible ripple across elements of the weave of magic. Using their ideals as an anchor for their focus, disciples enter a state of utter clarity where they can perceive and read these ripples, ultimately utilizing the power within these ripples—called {@bold tempo}—to fuel their mystical techniques. As a disciple grows and solidifies their grasp on their ideals, their ability to maintain this focus increases drastically, improving their martial abilities.": "弟子的魔法能力的关键是意识和专注。一个生物的每一个动作都会在魔法编织的元素中引起一个微小的、几乎无法察觉的涟漪。使用他们的理想作为他们注意力的锚，弟子们进入一个完全清晰的状态，在那里他们可以感知和阅读这些波纹，最终利用这些波纹中的力量--称为（%0%）--来推动他们的神秘技术。随着弟子的成长和对理想的巩固，他们保持这种专注的能力会大大增加，从而提高他们的武术能力。",
	"A disciple's ideals are represented in their fighting style by the sublime disciplines they follow. While some disciples discover these paths themselves, others learn them from masters of the art. Each sublime discipline holds one ideal above all others, and it serves as the anchor for the tempo techniques of that discipline. As a result, combat using these disciplines is a form of self expression and an opportunity to refine one's philosophy. The danger and rigor of the battlefield provides the perfect situation to test the disciple's focus, their understanding of themselves, and their values.": "弟子的理想在他们的战斗风格中表现为他们所遵循的崇高纪律。有些弟子自己发现了这些道路，有些则是从艺术大师那里学到的。每一门崇高学问都有一个高于所有其他学问的理想，它是该学问的节奏技术的支柱。因此，使用这些学科的战斗是一种自我表达的形式，也是完善自己理念的机会。战场上的危险和严酷提供了一个完美的环境来测试弟子的注意力，他们对自己的理解，以及他们的价值观。",
	"Because of this predisposition towards experience and conflict, it is rare you'll find a disciple that stays in one place for too long, or subsisting under the yoke of military regulation. They are natural wanderers, and tend to flock towards interesting people that may lead them to greater challenges and adventures. Such people often prove to be worthy rivals and life-long friends for the wandering disciple: the perfect sparks to ignite the flames of inspiration.": "由于这种对经验和冲突的倾向性，你很少会发现一个弟子在一个地方呆得太久，或在军事管制的枷锁下生存。他们是天生的流浪者，并倾向于涌向有趣的人，这些人可能会带领他们接受更大的挑战和冒险。这样的人往往被证明是流浪弟子值得信赖的对手和终生的朋友：是点燃灵感之火的完美火花。",
	"To a disciple, survival is often secondary to growth. To that end, you may yet find disciples working as sellswords or mercenaries in an attempt to find new conflicts to test themselves. Each and every fight is an opportunity to push past one's limits, and test not only ability, but also their willpower and determination. The path of the disciple is one filled with decision. Each must decide which disciplines to pursue and which to discard, as the path to perfection is littered with broken philosophies and weak hearts.": "对弟子来说，生存往往是次要的，而不是成长。为此，你可能会发现弟子们在做卖身契或雇佣兵，试图寻找新的冲突来测试自己。每一场战斗都是一个突破自己极限的机会，不仅考验能力，而且考验他们的意志力和决心。弟子的道路是一条充满决定的道路。每个人都必须决定追求哪些纪律，放弃哪些纪律，因为通往完美的道路上充满了破碎的哲学和脆弱的心。",
	"When you are creating your disciple, the most important thing to consider is why they fight. For a disciple, fighting is a means of self-discovery and affirmation. What kind of lessons have their fights taught them up until this point? What kind of person or warrior do they strive to be, and how close to that idealized version of themselves are they? Do they have a specific person or creature they are trying to defeat? Or perhaps they are seeking out a new mentor to fill a gap they feel in their skill or personhood? Consider how your character would feel when faced with what looks to be an insurmountable threat, and how they would feel after losing or defeating it.": "当你在创造你的弟子时，最重要的事情是考虑他们为什么要战斗。对弟子来说，战斗是一种自我发现和肯定的手段。到目前为止，他们的战斗给他们带来了什么样的教训？他们努力成为什么样的人或战士，以及他们离那个理想化的自己有多远？他们是否有一个特定的人或生物，他们正试图打败它？或者，他们正在寻找一位新的导师，以填补他们在技能或人格方面的空白？考虑一下你的角色在面对看似无法克服的威胁时的感受，以及他们在失去或击败威胁后的感受。",
	"Equally important is when your character first began to notice the flow of tempo around them. Was it something they always saw, but never realized its significance? Maybe it was inherited? Or maybe the power was unlocked in a dire moment of emotional or physical danger? Or did you eventually come to see the tendrils of tempo through deliberate training, either alone or under a master or school? Which discipline did you manifest first, and why? Lastly, how does your character feel about their power now? How your character first came upon this magic should influence how they feel about both it and themselves in relation to it.": "同样重要的是，你的角色何时开始注意到他们周围的节奏流动。这是他们一直看到的东西，但从未意识到它的重要性？也许是遗传的？或者也许这种力量是在情感或身体危险的严峻时刻被释放出来的？还是你最终通过刻意的训练看到了节奏的卷轴，无论是单独的还是在大师或学校的指导下？你首先体现的是哪一门学科，为什么？最后，你的角色现在对自己的力量有什么感觉？你的角色最初是如何接触到这种魔法的，应该影响他们对这种魔法和他们自己的感觉。",
	"You can make a disciple quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on weapons that use strength or finesse weapons. Your next-highest ability score should be Wisdom and then you make Constitution your third-highest score. Second, choose the {@background folk hero} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以快速地制造一个弟子。首先，将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分，这取决于你是想专注于使用力量的武器还是使用技巧的武器。你的第二高能力得分应该是智慧，然后你把宪法作为第三高得分。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"No true warrior fights in isolation; their friends, family, and all their allies follow them into every fight. Ardent Lion disciples fight using rallying cries and by utilizing the strength of their bonds to perform superhuman feats in combat.": "没有一个真正的战士是孤立地战斗的；他们的朋友、家人和所有的盟友都跟随他们参加每一场战斗。热心的狮子会弟子在战斗中使用集结号，并利用他们的纽带力量在战斗中表现出超人的能力。",
	"Your allies are your family, and those bonds are more precious than anything the world can muster. Cherish them and look out for them, for they will make you your best self.": "你的盟友就是你的家人，这些纽带比世界上的任何东西都要珍贵。珍惜他们，照顾他们，因为他们将使你成为最好的自己。",
	"As an action, you let out a riveting war cry that sends jolts through the body of your allies. Any allied creature within 30 feet can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.": "作为一个动作，你发出一个令人振奋的战吼，让你的盟友身体产生震动。30英尺范围内的任何盟友都可以使用他们的反应来移动到他们的速度而不引起机会攻击。",

The next attack it makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage if it is against someone other than you.": "当你用近战武器攻击击中一个生物时，你可以使用你的额外行动并花费1个节奏点在它们体内灌输犹豫。它在你下一回合开始前进行的下一次攻击，如果是针对你以外的人，则有劣势。",
	"As an action, you can spend up to 5 tempo points to bolster both you and an ally. You and an ally of your choice within 30 feet of you gain {@dice 1d8} temporary hit points for each tempo point you spent. These temporary hit points last 1 minute, until you use this technique again, or until you focus to regain your tempo.": "作为一个行动，你可以花费最多5个节奏点来增强你和一个盟友的力量。你和你所选择的30英尺内的盟友，每花费一个节奏点就会获得{@dice 1d8}的临时命中率。这些临时命中率持续1分钟，直到你再次使用这个技巧，或者直到你集中精力恢复你的节奏。",

	"To live life on the sidelines, bored and discontent, is to not really live life at all.

	"At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.": "在7级时，你的本能的敏捷性可以让你躲避某些区域效应，例如蓝龙的闪电气息或火球术。当你受到一个允许你做出灵巧救赎的效果，只受到一半的伤害时，如果你救赎成功，你就不会受到伤害，如果你失败，就只受到一半伤害。",

Additionally, being underwater imposes no penalties on your movement or attacks.": "在18级时，你的动作变得无法停止。你的移动不受困难地形的影响，法术和魔法效果不能降低你的速度，也不能使你的速度降低（%0%）或（%1%）。你可以花费5英尺的移动距离来自动摆脱非魔法的束缚。此外，在水下对你的移动和攻击没有惩罚。",
	"In the midst of combat, it is the warrior's weapon that brings them solace; wherein it is not merely a tool used to bring victory or survive, but rather an ally with which you trust your life.

	"Most often the Journey of the Conjurer begins with a reoccurring dream of an infinite field littered with weaponry from across the ages. Within this space you are free to use and manipulate, form and reform the weaponry and landscape as you see fit, perpetually in pursuit of the perfect arsenal.

	"When you choose this journey at 3rd level, whenever you roll initiative or as a bonus action, you can conjure or dismiss an arsenal of weightless spectral weapons that only you can wield, which hover in your space. While not wielding a shield, you can wield these weapons mentally, and they take the statistics of any simple or martial melee weapon that lacks the special property (use your choice of one or two hands for weapons with the versatile property). The weapons deal force damage instead of their normal damage type, gain the thrown property (range 20/60) if they didn't already have it, and automatically return to your space on a hit or miss. If you fall unconscious, the weapons are dismissed.": "当你在第三级选择这个旅程时，每当你掷出主动权或作为奖励动作时，你可以变出或遣散一个只有你能挥舞的无重量的幽灵武器库，它们在你的空间中盘旋。在不挥舞盾牌的情况下，你可以在精神上挥舞这些武器，而且它们具有任何缺乏特殊属性的简单或武术近战武器的统计数据（对于具有多功能属性的武器，请使用你选择的一只或两只手）。这些武器会造成力的伤害，而不是其正常的伤害类型，如果它们还没有获得投掷属性（射程20/60），并在击中或未击中时自动返回你的空间。如果你昏迷了，这些武器就会失效。",

	"At 18th level, you can bring out the full force of your arsenal in an instant. As an action, you create a visage of your field behind you and conjure 100 weapons all around you. Choose any number of creatures within 120 feet of you, and divide 100 projectiles among them (a creature can be targeted by up to 10 projectiles). Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@dice 1d8} force damage for each projectile launched at it, or half as much on a successful save. These weapons disappear at the end of your turn.": "在18级时，你可以在一瞬间发挥出你武器库的全部力量。作为一个动作，你在身后创造一个你的领域的幻象，并在你周围召唤出100个武器。在你周围120英尺范围内选择任意数量的生物，并在它们之间分配100个弹丸（一个生物最多可以被10个弹丸所瞄准）。每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，每向它发射一个弹丸，就会受到{@dice 1d8}力的伤害，如果蓄力成功，则会受到一半的伤害。这些武器会在你的回合结束时消失。",

	"The influence of tempo can reach further than most would think; after all everything moves, even your own spirit. Disciples that define themselves by intense emotions, or a need to prove their own self worth, can develop a sensitivity to the movements of their soul. After enough time, the disciple gains the ability to summon and wield this element of their soul in combat. Legends speak of disciples that attain definite control, and ultimately learn harness the divine spark that resides within them.": "节奏的影响可以达到比大多数人想象的更远；毕竟一切都在运动，甚至你自己的精神。以强烈的情绪定义自己的弟子，或需要证明自己的自我价值的弟子，可以发展出对自己灵魂运动的敏感性。经过足够的时间，弟子会获得在战斗中召唤和挥舞这种灵魂元素的能力。传说中的弟子能达到明确的控制，并最终学会驾驭居住在他们体内的神性火花。",
	"When you choose this journey at 3rd level, your passion can call forth the part of your soul that revels in the glory of battle. As a bonus action or when you roll initiative, you can manifest or dismiss two spectral arms that are connected to your upper body. When summoned, and on each of your turns thereafter, each arm can perform an object interaction, such as drawing a weapon.
