	"What is less known about beholders is their dual natures: beholders contain not one consciousness, but two that exist in their minds at the same time. Some beholders have personalities that are very much in sync, much like siblings that know each other so well that they can complete each others' sentences. These beholders can be of any alignment on the spectrum from good to evil.": "关于持像者不太为人所知的是他们的双重性质：持像者包含的不是一个意识，而是同时存在于他们头脑中的两个意识。有些持身者的个性非常一致，就像兄弟姐妹一样，他们彼此非常了解，可以完成对方的句子。这些持有者可以在从善到恶的光谱上有任何排列。",
	"Other beholders, though, have personalities that clash regularly--leading to the erratic and sometimes hostile behavior that the species is known for. These beholders tend to put personal survival above all other concerns, and are more likely to be evil as a result.": "然而，其他的持证人的个性经常发生冲突--导致该物种的行为反复无常，有时甚至充满敌意，这是众所周知的。这些持有者倾向于将个人生存置于所有其他问题之上，因此更可能是邪恶的。",

The creature may not know how they are aware of this fact--but, without a doubt, they believe there is something inherently disturbing about you.": "由于你对周围环境施加的异世界的影响，无论你的外表如何，你身上总是有一些令人不安的东西。当你呈人形时，密切观察你的生物（由DM决定）可以进行感知检查，检查标准为18。每当一个生物在这个检查中成功，他们就会认识到你的外表很接近，但不太适合你的物种成员。该生物可能不知道他们是如何意识到这一事实的--但是，毫无疑问，他们相信你身上有一些内在的令人不安的东西。",
	"At 10th level, you learn how to use the power of the Far Realm to alter the world in hazy, dreamlike ways. However, in this regard you are somewhat unique.
