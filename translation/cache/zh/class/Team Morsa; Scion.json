	"The mammoth devil stands before the adventurers, he has attempted to claim the city for the Nine Hells but this group has managed to thwart his plan time and time again. In the front line stands a man wearing only a robe, a shield and a sword, this man has a relaxed demeanor because he knows what he is up against. As the devil charges violently, the adventurer makes a swift movement where he channels the divine spark withing him marking the objective with a golden sigil at his feet giving him a tactical insight on his foe.": "猛犸象魔鬼站在冒险者面前，他曾试图为九层地狱索取这座城市，但这群人一次又一次地设法挫败了他的计划。在前线站着一个只穿着长袍、盾牌和剑的人，这个人的举止很轻松，因为他知道自己的对手是什么。当魔鬼猛烈冲锋时，这位冒险家做出了一个迅速的动作，他引导着他体内的神圣火花，在他的脚下用一个金色的符号来标记目标，让他对他的敌人有一个战术上的洞察力。",
	"Undetected, the high elf stares at her target from the rafters. She knows these men and women are dissidents of the church and she waits for their leader to show up, it is a just a matter of time.

Now she just needs to remember the way out or else she is dead.": "在未被发现的情况下，高精灵从椽子上凝视着她的目标。她知道这些男人和女人是教会的异见者，她等待着他们的领袖出现，这只是一个时间问题。当他出现的那一刻，她利用阴影出现在他身后，并立即将他杀死。现在她只需要记住出去的路，否则她就死定了。",

	"Legends speaks that the first scions were scholars who dedicated their time studying holy and unholy scriptures, trying to tap into the very essence of creation. After decades searching for the origin of the power of the gods, they learned how to channel that sacred power turning them into the perfect agents for their church. So many suspect that the hours spent reading and meditating is a form of praying but it really a way in which they are connect to that ancient power.": "传说中，第一批子孙是学者，他们致力于研究神圣和不神圣的经文，试图挖掘创造的本质。经过几十年对神力起源的探索，他们学会了如何引导神圣的力量，使他们成为教会的完美代理人。因此，许多人怀疑花在阅读和冥想上的时间是祈祷的一种形式，但这确实是他们与那股古老力量联系的一种方式。",

	"Once this is done think about your characters motivations. What alignment do you use to fight the enemies of your church? Did your god chose you or did you study to become a scion? How was your training like? What are your dreams like, are they visions of a dark future or something to seek? What types of tasks are you sent to by your order? Did someone try to distort the meaning of your dreams to turn you into a weapon?": "一旦这样做了，就考虑你的角色动机。你用什么方式与你教会的敌人作战？是你的神选择了你，还是你通过学习成为了一个子孙？你的训练是怎样的？你的梦是什么样子的，是对黑暗未来的憧憬，还是要寻求什么？你被你的命令派去执行什么类型的任务？是否有人试图歪曲你的梦的含义，把你变成武器？",
