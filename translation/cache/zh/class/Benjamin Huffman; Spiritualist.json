	"A spirit board consists of a planchette and small board or tablet, often made from paper and laminated to wood, that is decorated with letters and numbers. People use spirit boards to attempt to communicate with the dead by asking a question outloud and touching the planchette lightly, believing that unquiet spirits will use the planchette to spell out answers to the petitioner's questions.": "招魂板由一个刨花板和小板或平板组成，通常由纸和木头层压而成，上面装饰着字母和数字。人们使用招魂板试图与死者沟通，方法是大声提问并轻触板子，相信不安静的灵魂会用板子拼出请求者问题的答案。",
	"Spiritualists can use spirit boards as a spellcasting focus.": "灵媒可以使用灵板作为施法重点。",
	"Breathing deeply as wisps of incense rise around her, a human focuses her will on the mystical bonds that tie the objects in her hands to the person who once owned them. As she inhales, her eyes roll back and her eyelids flutter while her mind fills with a vision of a far away place. Through the haze, she sees the young half-dwarf she was searching for and the filthy tavern room he was hiding in.": "当一缕缕的香在她周围升起时，一个人深呼吸，将她的意志集中在神秘的纽带上，将她手中的物品与曾经拥有它们的人联系在一起。当她吸气时，她的眼睛向后翻，眼皮跳动，而她的脑海中充满了一个遥远地方的景象。透过朦胧，她看到了她正在寻找的那个年轻的半矮人，以及他所藏身的肮脏的酒馆房间。",
	"A halfling watches intently as the planchette moves across the board, hovering over one letter after another. As the letters string together into a name, the identity of the murder she's been chasing reveals itself and she raises one hand to her mouth in horror.": "一个半身人聚精会神地看着铅笔在棋盘上移动，盘旋在一个又一个字母上。当这些字母串联成一个名字时，她一直在追捕的谋杀案的身份就暴露出来了，她惊恐地举起一只手放在嘴边。",
	"Stopping suddenly, a lemurian listens intently to a sound no of his companions heard. Something had followed him back from the Ethereal Plane. Something too dangerous to leave be. He turns quickly, making a sign of exorcism in the air while walking towards the dark presence.": "突然停下脚步，一个狐狸精仔细听着他的同伴们没有听到的声音。有东西跟着他从虚空界回来了。有些东西太危险了，不能离开。他迅速转身，在空中做了一个驱魔的手势，同时走向那个黑暗的存在。",
	"Spiritualists are mediums, bridging the worlds of the living and the dead. Having barely escaped an encounter with death themselves, spiritualists commune with restless spirits for mystical power. They use their spells and occult talents to ensure their second chance at life isn't wasted.": "灵媒是沟通活人和死人世界的桥梁。在自己勉强逃脱了与死亡的遭遇之后，灵媒与不安的灵魂交流，以获得神秘的力量。他们利用自己的法术和神秘的天赋来确保他们的第二次生命机会不会被浪费。",
	"Not everyone who has a near death experience becomes a spiritualist but all spiritualists have survived an encounter that brought them to the brink of death. Spiritualists remember the specifics of the event unclearly. They often recall an ominous figure stepping out from the darkness offering an extension on their lives but further details, such as the cost of the favor, elude them. This incident was the catalyst for the acquisition of their occult powers, from spellcasting to communing with the dead to seeing beyond the borders of the physical realm.": "不是每个有濒死体验的人都会成为灵媒，但所有灵媒都经历过将他们带到死亡边缘的遭遇。灵媒人对事件的具体细节记得很不清楚。他们常常记得一个不祥的身影从黑暗中走出来，表示要延长他们的生命，但更多的细节，如这个忙的代价，他们却不知道。这一事件是他们获得神秘力量的催化剂，从咒语到与死人交流，再到看到物理领域的边界之外。",
	"The specific circumstances of a spiritualist's brush with death leaves a permanent impression on them. Those who survive the attack of a wild beast find they have the ability to command such predators following the experience. Spiritualists that survive a potentially fatal illness discover they can withstand diseases and toxins that would have previously been lethal.": "灵修者与死亡擦肩而过的具体情形给他们留下了永久的印象。那些在野兽袭击中幸存下来的人发现他们有能力在经历过后指挥这些掠夺者。在可能致命的疾病中幸存下来的灵媒，发现他们可以抵御以前会致命的疾病和毒素。",
	"Before they can see spirits, spiritualists can sense them. In the presence of ethereal beings the hair on the back of their necks will stand up or they'll get a splitting migraine or they hear the sound of a river rushing when none is nearby. Soon after they learn to beckon spirits to the share their minds and bodies. Then at last the spiritualist's eyes open to the world they already knew existed, the world of spirits that coexists alongside the physical realm.": "在他们能看到鬼魂之前，灵媒可以感觉到它们。在虚无缥缈的生命面前，他们的脖子后面的头发会竖起来，或者他们会感到偏头痛，或者在附近没有人的情况下听到河流奔腾的声音。不久之后，他们学会了召唤精神来分享他们的思想和身体。然后，灵媒的眼睛终于睁开了，看到了他们已经知道存在的世界，那是与物质世界并存的精神世界。",
	"Novice spiritualists quickly discover that, while the world is full of dead people, they tend to attract a certain type. The reason for this isn't precisely known, but among themselves spiritualists believe that the kinds of spirits they resonate with are representative of the spiritualist's own repressed or unexpressed emotions.": "新手灵媒很快发现，虽然世界上有很多死人，但他们往往会吸引某种类型的人。这方面的原因并不确切，但在灵修者中，他们认为与他们产生共鸣的灵体种类代表了灵修者自己被压抑或未表达的情绪。",
	"Spiritualists are torn between the worlds of the living and the dead. As you create your spiritualist character, the most important question to consider is: how do you see your role as a medium between these two worlds? Are your abilities the unwanted repercussions of a traumatic experience you'll never forget? Did the instance of your brush with death mark the start of a new and better life for you? Do you wish you could turn your senses away from the spirits of the departed? Did your awareness of the ethereal realm bring about an unexpected reunion with someone you lost?": "灵媒人在活人和死人的世界之间纠结。当你创造你的灵媒角色时，要考虑的最重要问题是：你如何看待你作为这两个世界之间的媒介的作用？你的能力是你永远不会忘记的创伤性经历所带来的不必要的反响吗？你与死亡擦肩而过的例子是否标志着你一个新的和更好的生活的开始？你是否希望你能把你的感官从死者的灵魂中移开？你对空灵领域的意识是否带来了与你失去的人的意外重逢？",
	"Spiritualists are further defined by the circumstances of their near death experience and the spirits they most frequently contact. Were you the child of a minor noble, targeted for assassination as a way of intimidating the upper class? Did you grow up in a rural village only to find that one year a plague swept through and only you survived? Were you traveling from one city to the next when a pack of wolves set upon you and your caravan and nearly took your life? The moment you came within a breath of dying, but didn't, you became a spiritualist.": "灵媒的定义还包括他们濒临死亡的经历和他们最常接触的灵体。你是否是一个小贵族的孩子，作为恐吓上层阶级的一种方式而成为暗杀的目标？你是否在农村长大，却发现有一年瘟疫席卷而来，只有你活了下来？你是否在从一个城市到另一个城市的旅行中，一群狼袭击了你和你的商队，几乎夺走了你的生命？当你离死亡不远的时候，但没有，你就成了一个灵媒。",
	"As a spiritualist, the unquiet dead seek you out, pleading for you to intervene on their behalf. What kind of requests are you most sympathetic to? Has a spirit ever asked you to do something you were unwilling to do? Have you ever agreed to help a spirit and later regretted it? Do you feel greater responsibility to the dead or the living? Are the spirits of the departed tools to use for your own gain or companions in their own right?": "作为一个灵媒，不安静的死者会找你，恳求你代表他们进行干预。你对哪种请求最感同情？灵魂是否曾经要求你做一些你不愿意做的事情？你是否曾经同意帮助一个灵魂，后来又后悔了？你觉得对死者还是对生者的责任更大？离世者的灵魂是为你自己的利益而使用的工具，还是他们自己的同伴？",
	"The answer to these questions will define you as a spiritualist.": "对这些问题的回答将决定你是一个灵修者。",
	"You can make a spiritualist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the {@background acolyte}, {@background charlatan}, or {@background hermit} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一个灵媒。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是灵巧或体质。第二，选择（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）的背景。",
