	"Standing alone in the swamp, knee deep in water, a half-orc woman places her hand upon the trunk of a very large tree. She mutters a question under her breath, and her vision moves through the vines that run throughout the swamp, as the swamp itself shows her the answer she seeks.": "一个半兽人女人独自站在沼泽里，膝盖深的水里，她把手放在一棵很大的树的树干上。她口中喃喃自语着一个问题，她的视线穿过贯穿整个沼泽的藤蔓，因为沼泽本身向她展示了她寻求的答案。",
	"Within a small purple tent in the market district of a large city, a tiefling sits hunched over a crystal ball, as he peers through reality to predict the future of the young boy who is paying him.": "在一个大城市的市场区的一个紫色小帐篷里，一个铁皮人蜷缩在一个水晶球上，他透过现实来预测向他付钱的小男孩的未来。",
	"Standing amidst a sea of corpses, the elven woman turns her gaze to one of the few remaining soldiers, as he cowers and begs for his life. She begins to cackle maniacally, as pain begins to wash throughout the soldier's entire body.": "站在一片尸山血海中，精灵女子将目光转向剩下的几个士兵中的一个，因为他畏惧并乞求自己的生命。她开始狂笑，因为疼痛开始冲刷着这个士兵的整个身体。",
	"Witches are the outcasts of society, powerful spellcasters who study magics frowned upon by most people. Usually prefering to stay away from cities and towns, witches seclude themselves to forests and swamps, away from the prying eyes of others, where they can practice their arcane arts in peace.": "女巫是社会的弃儿，是研究被大多数人所不齿的魔法的强大施法者。女巫通常喜欢远离城市和城镇，把自己隐居在森林和沼泽中，远离他人的窥视，在那里她们可以安静地练习她们的奥术。",
	"Similarly to their wizardly bretheren, witches use their knowledge of the arcane to perform their magic, studying spells and rituals. However, unlike wizards, witches are not bound by silly things like laws and morals. Free to study the secrets of the arcane in peace, witches are able to study magics that others would not dare look into; Powerful spells that rip the life from others, rituals that bring forth horrible fiends, and potent curses that cripple their targets.": "与他们的巫师兄弟类似，女巫利用她们的奥术知识来施展她们的魔法，研究法术和仪式。然而，与巫师不同，女巫不受法律和道德等愚蠢事物的约束。巫师可以自由地研究奥术的秘密，他们能够研究其他人不敢研究的魔法；强大的法术可以夺走他人的生命，仪式可以带来可怕的恶魔，强大的诅咒可以使他们的目标残废。",
	"Witches are not inherently evil. While there are many who pursue this path as a way to gain power, most simply wish to pursue their studies without the restrictions of magic institutions and colleges. Others are simply born into the life of a witch, never knowing the rules or morals of standard mages, simply studying what catches their interest. A rare few are born with a gift for the dark arts, abandoning society to futher improve their natural talents.": "女巫并不是天生的邪恶。虽然有很多人追求这条道路作为获得权力的方式，但大多数人只是希望在没有魔法机构和学院限制的情况下进行研究。其他人只是生来就是女巫，从来不知道标准法师的规则或道德，只是研究吸引他们兴趣的东西。少数人天生就有黑暗艺术的天赋，他们放弃了社会，以进一步提高他们的天赋。",
	"While witches come in many shapes and forms, almost all of them carry a familiar with them. While many mages keep familiars with them, witches tend to have a special bond with their familiars, often becoming very attached to the creatures. Their familiars act as both companion and protector, acting as scouts and conduits for the witch's magic.": "虽然女巫有很多形态，但几乎所有的女巫都带着一个熟悉的人。虽然许多法师都有自己的家人，但女巫往往与他们的家人有一种特殊的联系，常常变得非常依恋这些生物。他们的家族成员既是伙伴又是保护者，充当女巫魔法的侦察员和管道。",
	"As a witch grows in power, their familar reflects this as well, becoming more capable of delivering a witch's magic. Powerful witches are known to carry familiars that are able to hold their own against seasoned warriors. The most powerful witches have familiars that are able to share the burden of their magic, performing feats of spellcasting far outside the limits of any normal wizard.": "随着女巫力量的增长，她们的家人也会反映出这一点，变得更有能力传递女巫的魔法。众所周知，强大的女巫所携带的家族成员能够与经验丰富的战士抗衡。最强大的女巫拥有的家族成员能够分担他们的魔法负担，完成远远超出任何普通巫师极限的法术表演。",
	"While creating your witch character, one of the first things you should decide is why they follow the path of a witch. What led you to this decision? Were you once a member of a prestigious magic academy, but left due to the limitations of what you could learn? Perhaps you found an old tome that directed you in the ways of old magic. Or perhaps you were simply born into the life of a witch, never knowing any different.": "在创造你的女巫角色时，你应该首先决定的一件事是他们为什么要走女巫的道路。是什么导致了你的这个决定？你是否曾经是一所著名的魔法学院的成员，但由于你能学到的东西有限而离开？也许你找到了一本古老的书，指导你学习古老的魔法方法。也可能你只是生来就是女巫，从不知道有什么不同。",
	"What kind of life did your character live before their adventuring career began? Did you isolate yourself from the world, hiding away in forests and caves where you could practice you magic in peace? Did you try to integrate yourself with society, hiding away your magical prowess? Maybe you were well known as the witch that lived at the edge of town, interacting with the townsfolk only when they came by. Were you a part of a coven of witches? How large is it? Where is it based? Do you all live together, or do you simply meet every so often to perform your rituals?": "在冒险生涯开始之前，你的角色过着什么样的生活？你是否将自己与世界隔离开来，躲在森林和山洞里，在那里你可以安静地练习你的魔法？你是否试图让自己融入社会，把你的魔法能力隐藏起来？也许你是众所周知的住在小镇边缘的女巫，只有当镇上的人经过时才与他们交流。你是一个女巫团的成员吗？它有多大？它的基地在哪里？你们都住在一起，还是只是每隔一段时间就见面，进行你们的仪式？",
	"What led you to go out into the world and begin adventuring? Was it a craving for more power? An opportunity to test the skills and spells that you have learned over your years of study? Perhaps your coven sent you out on a quest or a journey to hone your skills. Or maybe your coven was raided by the nearby law enforcement, and now you're on the run.": "是什么导致你走向世界，开始冒险？是对更多力量的渴望吗？一个测试你多年来学习的技能和法术的机会？也许你的女巫团派你出去探险或旅行以磨练你的技能。或者是你的女巫团被附近的执法部门突袭，现在你正在逃亡中。",

Second, choose the {@background Sage} or {@background Hermit} background.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名女巫。首先，智力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是智慧或体质。第二，选择（%0%）或（%1%）的背景。",

	"For example, if you are a 3rd-level witch, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell witch bolt}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一个三级巫师，你有四个一级和两个二级的法术槽。在智力为16的情况下，你准备的法术清单可以包括6个1级或2级的法术，以任何方式组合。如果你准备了1级法术（%0%），你可以使用1级或2级法术槽来施放它。施放该法术并不会将其从你准备的法术列表中移除。",
	"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of witch spells requires time spent recalling the rituals and incantations for the spells: at least 1 minute per spell Level for each spell on your list.": "你可以在完成长时间休息后改变你准备的法术清单。准备一份新的巫师法术清单需要花时间回忆法术的仪式和咒语：你清单上的每个法术等级至少需要1分钟。",
	"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells, as your power comes from your study of the dark arts. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的巫师法术的施法能力，因为你的力量来自你对黑暗艺术的研究。每当法术提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的智力。此外，在设定你所施展的巫术的蓄力DC时，以及在用巫术进行攻击时，你会使用你的智力修饰。",
