	"The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme and plot endlessly, eternally. Each seeks to bring the others to heel. To ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the seven cities and every infernal thing that lives there, and lead an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.": "统治七座地狱之城的大魔鬼们无休止地谋划和密谋，直到永远。每个人都试图让其他人屈服。为了登上地狱王座，联合七座城市和生活在那里的每一个地狱之物，并带领无限的魔鬼军队穿越时空，直到所有的世界都被烧毁。",
	"Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the {@i illriggers}. Knights of Hell, they are charismatic counter-paladins who master devils, disrupt enemy organizations, and command Hell's armies.": "他们的精英突击队，即地狱的恐怖指挥官，是{@i illriggers}。地狱骑士，他们是有魅力的反牧师，掌握魔鬼，破坏敌人的组织，并指挥地狱军队。",
	"Millennia ago, the Lords of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. They came together to create the Order of Desolation, knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second.": "几千年前，地狱的领主们做了一件了不起的事：他们合作了。他们一起创建了 \"荒凉骑士团\"，骑士们发誓首先为地狱服务，其次才是他们的守护者大魔鬼。",
	"Acceptance into the Order of Desolation makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil you serve. Each archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But this association of illriggers consider themselves above the petty political squabbles that divide the seven cities.": "加入 \"荒凉骑士团 \"使你与其他所有的掘墓人成为战友，无论你为哪个大魔鬼服务。每个大恶魔都有教堂、地下爱好者、秘密社团和邪教。所有的领袖都狂热地奉献给赋予他们权力的大恶魔。但这个盗墓者协会认为他们超越了分裂七个城市的琐碎政治争吵。",
	"Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult might conclude that the presence of an illrigger in their midst is a sign that their archdevil approves of their actions, but the illriggers are independent. The order was founded to give the Lords of Hell agents capable of acting across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron. An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron's trust. Left to their own devices, the illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision.": "荒凉教团的成员，也被称为荒凉者，被认为是聪明、机智、有策略、善于操纵。一个寺庙或邪教可能会认为，在他们中间出现一个盗贼是他们的大魔鬼认可他们的行为的标志，但盗贼是独立的。该组织的建立是为了给地狱领主提供能够在整个时空范围内行动的代理人，不受其守护者的直接控制。唤醒者有许多由他们的大魔鬼授予的强大能力，但更珍贵的是他们的守护者的信任。在没有指示或监督的情况下，\"引爆者 \"被期望播撒不和谐、痛苦、纷争、欺骗和恐惧。",
	"It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to rely on other members of the order first, even from illriggers who serve other archdevils, before going to any church, cult, or temple devoted to their own archdevil.": "因此，在去任何致力于自己的大魔鬼的教堂、邪教或寺庙之前，荒凉教团的成员首先依靠其他教团成员，甚至从为其他大魔鬼服务的歹徒那里得到帮助，这并不罕见。",
	"You have a facility with speech and know how to manipulate an audience. Whenever you make an ability check to persuade, deceive, or intimidate, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8. Additionally you learn the Infernal language.": "你有说话的能力，知道如何操纵观众。每当你进行说服、欺骗或恐吓的能力检查时，你可以将7或更低的D20卷视为8。",
	"There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with {@dice 1d10} at 1st level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the Illrigger table. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life forceof enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality.": "你体内有一个地狱之力池，在你长时间休息后会得到补充。这个池子是用骰子表示的，在第一级时以（%0%）开始。你的能量池获得的骰子如Illrigger表上所示。利用这些骰子，你可以在你的触发器和其他目标之间转移命中率，以牺牲自己的健康为代价来治疗盟友，或者耗尽敌人的生命力来恢复自己的活力。",
	"As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. If you miss, nothing happens—you do not roll or lose dice from your pool. If you hit, or if you're targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice.": "作为一个行动，从你剩余的骰子中选择一个数量的骰子，并接触另一个生物。如果他们不愿意，这就是一个你精通的近战法术攻击，使用魅力作为你的法术能力。如果你没打中，什么也不会发生--你不会从你的池子里滚出或失去骰子。如果你打中了，或者你的目标是一个自愿的生物，就掷出所选择的骰子。",
	"The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If you're touching an ally, they gain that many hit points, ignoring any hit points in excess of their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number of hit points they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.": "你掷骰子的结果是你转移的打击点数。如果你接触的是一个盟友，他们就会获得同样多的命中率，忽略任何超过其最大命中率的命中率。你失去的打击点数等于他们获得的打击点数。如果你的牺牲使你的命中率降至0，你就会陷入昏迷。",
	"If you're touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you would gain hit points in excess of your maximum, you gain that number of temporary hit points instead.": "如果你接触到一个敌人，他们会受到与你的卷轴相等的坏死伤害，而你会获得那么多的打击点数。如果你获得的命中率会超过你的最大值，你会获得该数量的临时命中率。",
	"At 2nd level, you choose an illrigger fighting style:": "在2级时，你可以选择一种幻术的战斗方式。",
	"When you attack an enemy who has none of your allies adjacent to it, you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls.": "当你攻击一个没有你盟友相邻的敌人时，你会获得一个+3的伤害卷奖励。",
	"While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.": "当你没有穿戴任何盔甲时，你的护甲等级等于10+你的灵巧修正值+你的魅力修正值。你可以使用一个盾牌，并仍然获得这个好处。",
	"While you wield a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you can use your reaction after an adjacent enemy attacks you to move into any other unoccupied space within five feet of the attacking enemy. This movement does not provoke an opportunity attack.": "当你单手挥舞近战武器而不使用其他武器时，你可以在相邻的敌人攻击你后使用你的反应，移动到攻击的敌人5英尺内的任何其他无人的空间。这种移动不会激起机会攻击。",
	"When you attack with a two-handed melee weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for both the attack and damage rolls.": "当你用双手近战武器攻击时，你可以使用你的魅力修正值，而不是你的力量修正值，来进行攻击和伤害卷。",
	"When you reach 2nd level, you learn to use the power of Hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, you can place a seal on a target you can see within 30 feet. You can do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all your seals.": "当你达到2级时，你学会使用地狱的力量来训斥其他生物。作为一个额外的行动，你可以在30英尺范围内对你能看到的目标施加一个封印。你可以这样做的次数等于你的魅力修改器。当你完成一个短期或长期的休息时，你会恢复所有的封印。",
	"When you or an ally hits a target you can see with any seals on it, as free action, you can consume the seals to make the attack deal an extra {@dice 2d6} necrotic damage to the target per seal consumed. If you are within 30 feet of the target, you regain 2 hit points for each die of damage your seals deals.": "当你或盟友击中你能看到的带有任何封印的目标时，作为自由行动，你可以消耗封印，使攻击对目标造成额外的（%0%）坏死伤害，每消耗一个封印。如果你在目标的30英尺范围内，你的封印每造成一次伤害，你就会恢复2点生命值。",
	"A creature with a seal on them is an {@b interdicted creature.}": "身上有封印的生物是一个{@b interdicted creature.}。",
	"Seals evaporate if not used after 1 minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it's there; it appears to the illrigger as a glowing glyph on the creature's forehead. If a creature with any of your seals on it dies, you can move all of its seals to another creature within range.": "如果1分钟后不使用，封印就会蒸发。只有放置封印的唤醒者知道它的存在；对唤醒者来说，它就像生物额头上的一个发光字样。如果一个带有你的封印的生物死亡，你可以将它的所有封印转移到范围内的另一个生物身上。",
	"When you reach 3rd level, your mastery of deception makes it easy for you to recognize the use of concealing sorcery. As an action, you extend your awareness out from you. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures within 60 feet using magic to hide or disguise themselves.": "当你达到3级时，你对欺骗的掌握使你很容易识别出隐蔽巫术的使用。作为一个动作，你将你的意识从你身上延伸出去。直到你的下一个回合结束，你知道60英尺内使用魔法隐藏或伪装自己的生物的位置。",
	"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.": "你可以使用这个功能的次数等于你的魅力修改器。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得你所消耗的使用次数。",
	"When you reach 3rd level, you sign a diabolic contract with your archdevil who welcomes you into the Order of Desolation.

More cosmopolitan cities in the timescape—like Alloy, the City of Brass—will also respect your noble rank.": "此外，你是地狱名单中的贵族骑士，在地狱的任何地方都会得到很好的待遇和招待，甚至是被敌人的大魔鬼统治的城市。时空中更多的国际大都市--如黄铜之城的合金--也会尊重你的贵族等级。",
