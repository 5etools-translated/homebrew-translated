	"A young girl leaps forward through the flames, her shining silver hair contrasting her ochre skin under the light of the fire. She throws her dagger quickly toward the cultist before her, but it vanishes in a flash of light just after leaving her hand. The foe advances on her before letting out a ghastly moan and falling to the floor. A small dagger sticks out of the center of his back.": "一个年轻女孩从火焰中跃出，她闪亮的银发在火光下与她赭色的皮肤形成鲜明对比。她把匕首迅速扔向面前的邪教徒，但匕首刚离开她的手就在一束光中消失了。敌人向她走来，然后发出一声凄厉的呻吟，倒在了地上。一把小匕首从他的背部中央伸出来。",
	"An old elven man stands at the precipice of an enormously tall cliff, his cracked spectacles sitting low on his withered nose. He stares out into the distance, a bright and beautiful wilderness of verdant green mountains and valleys, accented by two massive floating islands of stone. He chuckles to himself, only slightly, before his view is obstructed by a flash of light and a disk of swirling colors opens up before him.": "一个精灵老人站在一个极高的悬崖峭壁上，他干裂的眼镜低垂在他枯萎的鼻子上。他凝视着远方，那是一片明亮而美丽的荒野，由青翠的山脉和山谷组成，并有两个巨大的石头浮岛作为点缀。他自嘲地笑了笑，只是微微一笑，然后他的视线就被一道闪光所阻挡，在他面前出现了一个旋转着的颜色盘。",
	"Nomads are planar travelers, hunters, trackers, vagabonds, and explorers. They are experts in the traversal of the planes whose wanderlust is never satisfied and whose Journey is unending.": "游牧民族是平面旅行者、猎人、追踪者、流浪者和探险家。他们是穿越星球的专家，他们的漫游欲永远不会满足，他们的旅程是无止境的。",
	"The life of a nomad is one of discovery and adventure, chasing a concept known as The Journey. This is the final goal of most nomads, a goal of experiencing every facet of existence. Nomads travel in pursuit of all of the things that will occur to them along the way, absorbing and enjoying all life's experiences.": "游牧民族的生活是一个发现和冒险的过程，追逐一个被称为 \"旅程 \"的概念。这是大多数游牧民族的最终目标，是体验生存的每一个方面的目标。游牧者在旅行中追求沿途发生的所有事情，吸收和享受所有的生活经验。",
	"Some choose to organize and take up large parties, traversing the planes together in search of interpersonal experiences. Others enjoy the solitude of a personal Journey, opting to explore the infinite possibilities of the cosmos alone.": "有些人选择组织和参加大型聚会，一起穿越平面，寻找人际关系的经验。其他人则享受个人旅程的孤独，选择独自探索宇宙的无限可能性。",
	"Nomads generally have a hard time settling down in any one place for too long, even when their years have nearly finished. Ending The Journey before they pass on simply never occurs to most, such is the ambition of the nomad.": "游牧民族一般很难在一个地方安顿太久，即使他们的岁月已经接近尾声。在他们去世之前结束旅程，对大多数人来说根本不可能，这就是游牧人的雄心壮志。",
	"Those who travel the planes find themselves drawn to certain aspects of one plane or another. With time and distance this attraction, or link, grows stronger, drawing the nomad's mind back to it for reasons they may not understand. This link draws on certain aspects deep inside a person's soul and binds it to the plane, a permanent manifestation of the planes and their otherworldly power fixed in the mind of the traveller.": "那些旅行的人发现自己被一个或另一个星球的某些方面所吸引。随着时间和距离的推移，这种吸引力，或者说联系，越来越强，吸引着游牧者的思想回到他们可能不理解的原因。这种联系吸引着一个人灵魂深处的某些方面，并将其与平面捆绑在一起，在旅行者的脑海中固定了平面和它们的异世界力量的永久表现。",
	"Those who research the planes have theorized that a force similar to tectonic shifts in the earth occurs between the planes, generating powerful magic. This magic has something similar to a grand sentience, and can \"see\" the creatures it affects. From these theories arose a kind of worship among some nomads, where they view themselves as minor patrons of the eldritch existence that is The Great Wheel itself, though not all believe this story.": "研究这些星球的人理论上认为，一种类似于地球构造变化的力量发生在这些星球之间，产生了强大的魔法。这种魔法具有类似于大智慧的东西，可以 \"看到 \"它所影响的生物。从这些理论中，一些游牧民族产生了一种崇拜，他们认为自己是大轮回本身这一超自然存在的小赞助者，尽管不是所有人都相信这个故事。",
	"The link a nomad forms may be a tangible choice that they expect or feel immediately, or it may be that a plane one only passed through briefly left a subtle impression upon their mind.": "游牧民族形成的联系可能是他们期望或立即感受到的有形选择，也可能是一个人只短暂经过的飞机在他们的头脑中留下了微妙的印象。",
	"In the creation of your nomad character, consider what made them take up The Journey in the first place, and why they continue in their quest. Did your father or mother bring you along on their travels? Did you hear of some fantastical tale of planes far away? Or did you simply become bored with the mundane triviality of the material?": "在创造你的游牧民族角色时，考虑是什么让他们一开始就开始了 \"旅程\"，以及他们为什么继续追求。你的父亲或母亲在他们的旅行中是否带着你？你是否听说过一些关于远方飞机的奇幻故事？还是你只是对材料的平凡琐碎感到厌烦？",
	"What have you done on your Journey? Was there a perilous dash through Pandemonium and the Nine Hells? A calm stroll through Bytopia that made you rethink your motivations? Could there even have been a whirlwind romp through the most renowned taverns of the outer planes?": "你在旅途中都做了些什么？是否有一个危险的冲刺，穿过潘德蒙和九层地狱？在拜托邦的平静漫步让你重新思考你的动机？甚至有可能是在外星最著名的酒馆中的旋风式狂欢？",
	"How has your planar link affected you? Maybe you found yourself linked to a hideous plane of evil despite your cloistered youth, and it has drawn out dark thoughts that you had once forgotten? Or did you truly connect with your plane and have often fought yourself on whether to remain there, only to leave it behind?": "你的平面链接对你有什么影响？也许你发现自己与一个可怕的邪恶位面有联系，尽管你是个隐居的年轻人，它引出了你曾经遗忘的黑暗思想？或者你真的与你的平面联系在一起，并经常与自己争论是否要留在那里，只是把它抛在脑后？",
	"The great variety of planes and nomads means that they can fall into any alignment or planar link, though most who have seen the extremes of  good, evil, law, and chaos prefer to remain neutral.": "平面和游牧民族的巨大多样性意味着他们可以陷入任何排列组合或平面联系，尽管大多数见过善、恶、法律和混乱等极端情况的人更愿意保持中立。",
	"You can make a nomad quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the {@background outlander} background.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名游牧民。首先，力量或灵巧应该是你的最高能力得分，其次是智慧。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"Scattered as they may be, even nomads share certain sensibilities through their tendencies. A nomad seeks to see and experience as much of the multiverse as they can, but most would agree that they have a special connection to one place in particular. The multiverse has a way of making that connection tangible, especially to those who regularly travel the planes.": "尽管他们可能是分散的，但即使是游牧民族也会通过他们的倾向分享某些感性。游牧民族试图尽可能多地观察和体验多元宇宙，但大多数人都会同意，他们与某个地方有着特殊的联系。多元宇宙有办法使这种联系具体化，特别是对那些经常旅行的人来说。",

	"This was my first attempt in a long while at writing up a full class, and hopefully it turns out well! I recently had the opportunity to try out two interesting homebrew classes in real play: {@link The Companion|https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/HkbtsQUJGW} (by /u/shadowsocks) and {@link The Noble|https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_fO9drMhlUealJLdFBXTHp2OG8/view} (by/u/impersonater). Both were incredibly interesting to read, but upon starting a character sheet it became clear that they were overly complex and unwieldy. I had ideas on where to improve them, which got me into a class-making mindset and gave me the impulse I needed to finally go back to working on this old idea I had. (just as a note, The Companion class has improved tremendously over time, and the newest version is much better than the one I tried.)": "这是我很久以来第一次尝试写一个完整的班级，希望它能有好的结果！\"。我最近有机会在实际游戏中尝试了两个有趣的自制类：{@link The Companion|https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/HkbtsQUJGW}（由/u/shadowsocks）和{@link The Noble|https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_fO9drMhlUealJLdFBXTHp2OG8/view}（由/u/impersonater）。两者读起来都非常有趣，但在开始使用角色表时，就发现它们过于复杂和不方便。我有了改进它们的想法，这让我进入了造类的思维，并给了我需要的冲动，最终回到了我的这个旧想法上工作。(作为说明，随着时间的推移，\"同伴 \"类有了巨大的改进，最新的版本比我试过的版本好得多）。",
	"The current idea for the class was based around a larger homebrew I'm working on at the moment, but I've thought about this sort of plane-hopping vagabond before, and it seemed like a good fit. The name and uniqueness of the class were difficult though, because of course any adventurer could jump between the planes, and none had powers like these. This led to the development of their lore and the concept of \"The Journey\" and Planar Links, which help establish that these characters are different in meaningful ways compared to characters like the horizon walker ranger, for example.": "这个等级目前的想法是基于我目前正在进行的一个较大的自制作品，但我以前也想过这种跳楼的流浪者，它似乎很适合。不过，这个等级的名称和独特性是很困难的，因为当然任何冒险者都可以在不同的星球之间跳跃，而没有人有像这样的能力。这导致了他们的传说和 \"旅程 \"的概念以及星球链接的发展，这有助于确立这些角色与地平线游侠等角色相比在意义上的不同。",
	"The name gave me trouble because while this could just be called \"The Planeswalker\", that name is overused and draws unwanted comparisons to Magic: The Gathering's idea of planeswalkers. This led to the derivative \"Planeseeker\" and \"Planar Wanderer\" names before I thought of the UA Mystic and their portal-based subclass, the Nomad.": "这个名字给我带来了麻烦，因为虽然它可以被称为 \"行者\"，但这个名字被过度使用了，而且会引起人们对《魔法：集会》中行者概念的不必要的比较。这导致了在我想到UA神秘人和他们基于传送门的子类--游牧者之前，衍生出了 \"Planeseeker \"和 \"Planar Wanderer \"的名字。",
	"The mechanical identity of this class is meant to be similar in some ways to {@link The Warden|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_RIYUWCXLYp-tLkT5MjwOd7fN71r7r-h/view} by /u/Layhnet (a very well made class): a primarily martial class with some magical ability, a sort of inverse of the warlock (a magical class with some martial ability).": "这个等级的机械特性在某些方面与/u/Layhnet的{@link The Warden|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_RIYUWCXLYp-tLkT5MjwOd7fN71r7r-h/view}相似（一个非常好的等级）：一个主要是武术的等级，有一些魔法能力，是术士（一个有一些武术能力的魔法等级）的某种逆向。",
	"The last version that I posted of this finally got a good amount of solid feedback. The class was (rightfully) torn apart for a lot of shortcomings, and I've taken a lot of that constructive criticism to heart. I now proudly present the Nomad 2.0!": "我发布的最后一个版本终于得到了大量的可靠反馈。这门课被（理所当然地）撕掉了很多缺点，我已经把很多建设性的批评意见记在心里。我现在自豪地介绍游牧人2.0版",

	"As a nomad, you are a master of minor portals, and can use them to enhance your combat abilities. At 1st level, when you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn with a melee weapon that lacks the reach property, the reach of your weapon becomes 10 feet until the end of your turn as you conjure a short-range portal through which your weapon passes mid-swing. Attacks made in this way don't ignore cover and require the target to be visible. This technique requires one of your hands to be free to create the portal.": "作为一个游牧民族，你是一个小型传送门的大师，并且可以使用它们来增强你的战斗能力。在1级的时候，当你在你的回合中使用缺乏伸手属性的近战武器进行{@action Attack}行动时，你的武器的伸手范围会变成10英尺，直到你的回合结束，因为你会变出一个短距离的传送门，你的武器在挥动中会通过这个传送门。以这种方式进行的攻击不会忽略掩体，并且要求目标是可见的。这个技巧要求你的一只手可以自由地创造门户。",

The portals are glowing, oblong, spheroids hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it.": "作为你回合中的一个行动，你消耗你的传送门艺术的一个使用权来创造链接的传送门，这些传送门保持开放长达1分钟，直到4个生物或物体通过它们，或者直到你选择关闭它们作为一个奖励行动。在你能看到的地面上选择两个无人的空间，一个在你周围5英尺内，另一个在你周围30英尺内。每个点上都会打开一个传送门。这些传送门是发光的、长方形的、盘旋在离地面几英寸的地方并与之垂直的球体。充满每个传送门的雾气是不透明的，通过它可以阻挡视线。",
	"Any Medium or smaller creature or object entering the space the portal occupies exits from the other portal as if the two were the same space. For example, if an arrow enters the portal from the east, it will emerge from the west as if it had passed through any other empty space. A creature forced into the portal's space can make a Dexterity saving throw to resist moving through it, emerging in the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to the portal on a successful save.": "任何中等或较小的生物或物体进入传送门占据的空间，都会从另一个传送门出来，就像两者是同一个空间一样。例如，如果一支箭从东边进入传送门，它将从西边出来，就像它穿过任何其他空的空间一样。被迫进入传送门空间的生物可以做一个灵巧的蓄力动作来抵制通过它，如果蓄力成功，就会出现在与传送门相邻的最近的无人空间。",

	"Nomads are travellers, and often they traverse all manner of planes and demiplanes in their lives. Much like travellers of the material, though, they always hold within their hearts some link to a certain plane. At 3rd level, you have matured in your travels enough to have established a magical and personal link. There are obviously a great many planes and regions in the multiverse. Some common Planar Links that are presented at the end of this class description are {@class Nomad|NMD|The Elemental Planes|Elemental Plane|NMD}, {@class Nomad|NMD|The Far Realms|Far Realm|NMD} and {@class Nomad|NMD|The Astral Plane|Astral Plane|NMD}.": "游牧民族是旅行者，他们经常在生活中穿越各种形式的平面和半平面。不过，和物质的旅行者一样，他们的内心总是与某个位面保持着某种联系。在第三层，你已经在旅行中成熟到足以建立起一种神奇的个人联系。在多元宇宙中显然有许多平面和区域。在这个等级描述的结尾处介绍的一些常见的平面链接是（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。",
