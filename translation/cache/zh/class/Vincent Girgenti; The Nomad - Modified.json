	"A young girl leaps forward through the flames, her shining silver hair contrasting her ochre skin under the light of the fire. She throws her dagger quickly toward the cultist before her, but it vanishes in a flash of light just after leaving her hand. The foe advances on her before letting out a ghastly moan and falling to the floor. A small dagger sticks out of the center of his back.": "一个年轻女孩从火焰中跃出，她闪亮的银发在火光下与她赭色的皮肤形成鲜明对比。她把匕首迅速扔向面前的邪教徒，但匕首刚离开她的手就在一束光中消失了。敌人向她走来，然后发出一声凄厉的呻吟，倒在了地上。一把小匕首从他的背部中央伸出来。",
	"An old elven man stands at the precipice of an enormously tall cliff, his cracked spectacles sitting low on his withered nose. He stares out into the distance, a bright and beautiful wilderness of verdant green mountains and valleys, accented by two massive floating islands of stone. He chuckles to himself, only slightly, before his view is obstructed by a flash of light and a disk of swirling colors opens up before him.": "一个精灵老人站在一个极高的悬崖峭壁上，他干裂的眼镜低垂在他枯萎的鼻子上。他凝视着远方，那是一片明亮而美丽的荒野，由青翠的山脉和山谷组成，两座巨大的浮动石岛为其点缀。他自嘲地笑了笑，只是微微一笑，然后他的视线就被一道闪光所阻挡，在他面前出现了一个旋转着的颜色盘。",
	"Nomads are planar travelers, hunters, trackers, vagabonds, and explorers. They are experts in the traversal of the planes whose wanderlust is never satisfied and whose Journey is unending.": "游牧民族是平面旅行者、猎人、追踪者、流浪者和探险家。他们是穿越星球的专家，他们的漫游欲永远不会满足，他们的旅程是无止境的。",
	"The life of a nomad is one of discovery and adventure, chasing a concept known as The Journey. This is the final goal of most nomads, a goal of experiencing every facet of existence. Nomads travel in pursuit of all of the things that will occur to them along the way, absorbing and enjoying all life's experiences.": "游牧民族的生活是一个发现和冒险的过程，追逐一个被称为 \"旅程 \"的概念。这是大多数游牧民族的最终目标，是体验存在的每一个方面的目标。游牧者在旅行中追求沿途发生的所有事情，吸收和享受所有的生活经验。",
	"Some choose to organize and take up large parties, traversing the planes together in search of interpersonal experiences. Others enjoy the solitude of a personal Journey, opting to explore the infinite possibilities of the cosmos alone.": "有些人选择组织和参加大型聚会，一起穿越平面，寻找人际关系的经验。其他人则享受个人旅程的孤独，选择独自探索宇宙的无限可能性。",
	"Nomads generally have a hard time settling down in any one place for too long, even when their years have nearly finished. Ending The Journey before they pass on simply never occurs to most, such is the ambition of the nomad.": "游牧民族一般很难在一个地方安顿太久，即使他们的岁月已经接近尾声。在他们去世之前结束旅程，对大多数人来说根本不可能，这就是游牧人的雄心壮志。",
	"Those who travel the planes find themselves drawn to certain aspects of one plane or another. With time and distance this attraction, or link, grows stronger, drawing the nomad's mind back to it for reasons they may not understand. This link draws on certain aspects deep inside a person's soul and binds it to the plane, a permanent manifestation of the planes and their otherworldly power fixed in the mind of the traveller.": "那些旅行的人发现自己被一个或另一个星球的某些方面所吸引。随着时间和距离的推移，这种吸引力，或者说联系，越来越强，吸引着游牧者的思想回到他们可能不理解的原因。这种联系吸引着一个人灵魂深处的某些方面，并将其与平面捆绑在一起，在旅行者的脑海中固定了平面和它们的异世界力量的永久表现。",
	"Those who research the planes have theorized that a force similar to tectonic shifts in the earth occurs between the planes, generating powerful magic. This magic has something similar to a grand sentience, and can \"see\" the creatures it affects. From these theories arose a kind of worship among some nomads, where they view themselves as minor patrons of the eldritch existence that is The Great Wheel itself, though not all believe this story.": "研究这些星球的人理论上认为，一种类似于地球构造变化的力量发生在这些星球之间，产生了强大的魔法。这种魔法具有类似于大智慧的东西，可以 \"看到 \"它所影响的生物。从这些理论中，一些游牧民族产生了一种崇拜，他们认为自己是大轮回本身这一超自然存在的小赞助者，尽管不是所有人都相信这个故事。",
	"The link a nomad forms may be a tangible choice that they expect or feel immediately, or it may be that a plane one only passed through briefly left a subtle impression upon their mind.": "游牧民族形成的联系可能是他们期望或立即感受到的有形选择，也可能是一个人只短暂经过的飞机在他们的头脑中留下了微妙的印象。",
	"In the creation of your nomad character, consider what made them take up The Journey in the first place, and why they continue in their quest. Did your father or mother bring you along on their travels? Did you hear of some fantastical tale of planes far away? Or did you simply become bored with the mundane triviality of the material?": "在创造你的游牧民族角色时，考虑是什么让他们一开始就开始了 \"旅程\"，以及他们为什么继续追求。你的父亲或母亲在他们的旅行中是否带着你？你是否听说过一些关于远方飞机的奇幻故事？还是你只是对材料的平凡琐碎感到厌烦？",
	"What have you done on your Journey? Was there a perilous dash through Pandemonium and the Nine Hells? A calm stroll through Bytopia that made you rethink your motivations? Could there even have been a whirlwind romp through the most renowned taverns of the outer planes?": "你在旅途中都做了些什么？是否有一个危险的冲刺，穿过潘德蒙和九层地狱？在拜托邦的平静漫步让你重新思考你的动机？甚至有可能是在外星最著名的酒馆中的旋风式狂欢？",
	"How has your planar link affected you? Maybe you found yourself linked to a hideous plane of evil despite your cloistered youth, and it has drawn out dark thoughts that you had once forgotten? Or did you truly connect with your plane and have often fought yourself on whether to remain there, only to leave it behind?": "你的平面链接对你有什么影响？也许你发现自己与一个可怕的邪恶位面有联系，尽管你是个隐居的年轻人，它引出了你曾经遗忘的黑暗思想？或者你真的与你的平面联系在一起，并经常与自己争论是否要留在那里，只是把它抛在脑后？",
	"The great variety of planes and nomads means that they can fall into any alignment or planar link, though most who have seen the extremes of  good, evil, law, and chaos prefer to remain neutral.": "平面和游牧民族的巨大多样性意味着他们可以陷入任何排列组合或平面联系，尽管大多数见过善、恶、法律和混乱等极端情况的人更愿意保持中立。",
	"You can make a nomad quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the {@background outlander} background.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名游牧民。首先，力量或灵巧应该是你的最高能力得分，其次是智力。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"As a nomad, you are a master of minor portals, and can use them to enhance your combat abilities. At 1st level, when you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn with a melee weapon, the reach of your weapon becomes 10 feet until the end of your turn as you conjure a short-range portal through which your weapon passes mid-swing. Attacks made in this way don't ignore cover and require the target to be visible. This technique requires one of your hands to be free to create the portal. Additionally you can utilize your portals with the fast-moving projectiles of ranged weapons, allowing you to make Far Strike attacks with them. This does not change the range of the weapon.": "作为一个游牧民族，你是一个小型传送门的大师，并且可以使用它们来增强你的战斗能力。一级时，当你在使用近战武器的回合中采取{@action Attack}行动时，你的武器的射程会变成10英尺，直到你的回合结束，因为你会变出一个短距离的传送门，你的武器会在挥动中通过。以这种方式进行的攻击不会忽略掩体，并且要求目标是可见的。这个技巧要求你的一只手能自由地创造出传送门。此外，你可以用远程武器的快速移动弹丸来利用你的传送门，使你可以用它们进行远距离攻击。这并不改变武器的射程。",
	"Your Far Strike Range increases to 20 feet when you reach 11th level, and 30 feet when you reach 18th level.": "你的远距离攻击范围在你达到11级时增加到20英尺，在你达到18级时增加到30英尺。",
	"At 2nd level, you learn to utilize your portals in thoughtful and unique ways. You begin with one simple Portal Art: Portal, and gain additional Portal Arts options as you gain levels in this class.": "在第2级时，你学会以深思熟虑和独特的方式利用你的传送门。你从一种简单的传送门艺术开始。随着你等级的提高，你将获得更多的传送门艺术选项。",
	"You choose what effect you create when you use your Portal Arts. You have a number of uses of these arts equal to your Intelligence modifier. All expended uses are restored when you finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}.": "当你使用你的传送门艺术时，你可以选择你创造的效果。你对这些艺术的使用次数等于你的智力修正值。当你完成一个{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}时，所有消耗的使用次数都会恢复。",
	"Your Portal Arts are dependent upon your Intelligence, your knowledge of the planes from which you draw these effects.": "你的传送门艺术取决于你的智力，以及你对这些效果所来自的星球的知识。",
	"Some Portal Arts require a saving throw. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC is calculated as follows:": "有些传送门艺术需要一个蓄力动作。当你使用这个等级的这种效果时，DC的计算方法如下。",
	"As an action on your turn, you expend a use of your Portal Arts to create linked teleportation portals that remain open for up to 1 minute, until 4 creatures or objects have passed through them, or until you choose to close them as a bonus action. Choose two unoccupied spaces on the ground that you can see, one within 5 feet of you and the other within 30 feet of you. A portal opens over each point. The portals are glowing, oblong, spheroids hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it.": "作为你回合中的一个行动，你消耗你的传送门艺术的一个使用权来创造链接的传送门，这些传送门保持开放长达1分钟，直到4个生物或物体通过它们，或者直到你选择关闭它们作为一个奖励行动。在你能看到的地面上选择两个无人的空间，一个在你周围5英尺内，另一个在你周围30英尺内。每个点上都会打开一个传送门。这些传送门是发光的、长方形的、盘旋在离地面几英寸的地方并与之垂直的球体。充满每个传送门的雾气是不透明的，通过它可以阻挡视线。",
	"Any Medium or smaller creature or object entering the space the portal occupies exits from the other portal as if the two were the same space. For example, if an arrow enters the portal from the east, it will emerge from the west as if it had passed through any other empty space. A creature forced into the portal's space can make a Dexterity saving throw to resist moving through it, emerging in the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to the portal on a successful save.": "任何中等或较小的生物或物体进入传送门占据的空间，都会从另一个传送门出来，就像两者是同一个空间一样。例如，如果一支箭从东边进入传送门，它将从西边出来，就像它穿过任何其他空的空间一样。被迫进入传送门空间的生物可以做一个灵巧的蓄力动作来抵制通过它，如果蓄力成功，就会出现在与传送门相邻的最近的无人空间。",
	"The range of the second portal increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level.": "第二个传送门的范围在11级时增加到60英尺，17级时增加到120英尺。",

	"Nomads are travellers, and often they traverse all manner of planes and demiplanes in their lives. Much like travellers of the material, though, they always hold within their hearts some link to a certain plane. At 3rd level, you have matured in your travels enough to have established a magical and personal link. There are obviously a great many planes and regions in the multiverse. Some common Planar Links that are presented at the end of this class description are {@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Elemental Planes|Elemental Plane|NMD:BN}, {@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Far Realms|Far Realm|NMD:BN} and {@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Astral Plane|Astral Plane|NMD:BN}.": "游牧民族是旅行者，他们经常在生活中穿越各种形式的平面和半平面。不过，和物质的旅行者一样，他们的内心总是与某个位面保持着某种联系。在第三层，你已经在旅行中成熟到足以建立起一种神奇的个人联系。在多元宇宙中显然有许多平面和区域。在这个等级描述的结尾处介绍的一些常见的平面链接是（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。",
	"Your Planar Link grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level.": "你的 \"平面链接 \"在3级时授予你特性，并在7级、10级和14级时再次授予你特性。",
	"At 6th level, you reflexes develop, allowing you to jump through the portals you create with {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}. When you hit a creature with a melee {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} attack, you can expend a use of your Portal Arts to jump through the portal created around your weapon, emerging in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. If the attack is made with a ranged weapon, you can choose to move up to your {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} range in any direction after the attack.": "在6级时，你的反射能力得到发展，允许你跳过你创造的传送门（%0%）。当你用近战攻击击中一个生物时，你可以消耗一次你的传送门术，跳过你的武器周围创造的传送门，出现在目标5英尺内的一个无人空间。如果是用远程武器攻击，你可以选择在攻击后向任何方向移动到你的（%2%）范围。",
	"By 9th level, you can blink from place to place with ease. Once on your turn if you get at least a 10 foot run up in a straight line, you can teleport to a range equal to up to half your movement, appearing in an unoccupied space that you can see. You still expend movement as if you were walking. Taking the {@action Dash} action can increase the range that you can teleport.": "到了第九级，你可以轻松地从一个地方眨眼到另一个地方。在你的回合中，如果你在一条直线上至少跑了10英尺，你可以瞬移到相当于你运动量一半的范围内，出现在一个你能看到的无人的空间。你仍然会像走路一样消耗移动力。采取{@action Dash}行动可以增加你可以传送的范围。",
	"By 11th level, you have learned to create special portals with multiple exits. Once on your turn, you can target a second creature with one of your {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} attacks when you take the {@action Attack} action. The same, single attack roll is used for both targets of the attack.": "到11级时，你已经学会了创造具有多个出口的特殊传送门。在你的回合中，你可以在采取{@action Attack}行动时，用你的{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}攻击中的一个目标攻击第二个生物。攻击的两个目标都使用相同的、单一的攻击卷。",
	"At 17th level, you no longer have to search for planar portals. As an action on your turn, you establish an interplanar link. You open a portal to a location on a plane that you have been to before and remember in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The portal's destination must be on a plane you are not currently on, and it is visible through the portal.": "在17级时，你不再需要寻找星际传送门。作为你回合中的一个行动，你建立一个星际链接。你打开一个传送门到一个你曾经去过的平面上的一个位置，并记住在你周围5英尺内的一个无人空间。传送门的目的地必须是在你目前不在的平面上，而且通过传送门可以看到它。",
	"The portal is large enough for Medium or smaller creatures to pass through easily. A creature that is forced into the portal can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid going through. On a successful save, the creature appears in an occupied space adjacent to the portal.": "入口足够大，中型或小型生物可以轻易通过。被迫进入传送门的生物可以做一个灵巧的蓄力动作来避免通过。拯救成功后，该生物会出现在传送门附近的一个空间。",
	"Otherwise, they are sent through the port and its destination. The portal remains open for 1 minute until you close it as a bonus action on your turn.": "否则，它们将被送入港口和目的地。入口保持开放1分钟，直到你在你的回合中以额外行动关闭它。",

	"At 20th level, your skill for creating portals becomes unsurpassed, allowing you to create portals stable enough to withstand the test of time. With 4 hours of work and 2000 gp in materials you can create a permanent planar gateway large enough for Medium or smaller creatures, or double the time and cost for Large or smaller creatures. You must create two gateways to be able to travel between them.": "在20级时，你创造传送门的技能变得无与伦比，允许你创造足够稳定的传送门以经受时间的考验。通过4个小时的工作和2000金币的材料，你可以创造出一个足够大的永久性平面门，供中型或小型生物使用，如果是大型或小型生物，则需要双倍的时间和费用。你必须创造两个门才能在它们之间旅行。",
	"Gateways created by this feature are round frames of wood, metal, or other materials that house a portal and keep it stable in the absence of its creator. If the frame is made incomplete in any way, such as by it being burned, crushed, or toppled, the portal closes immediately.": "由该功能创造的门是由木头、金属或其他材料制成的圆形框架，用于容纳一个门，并在创造者不在时保持其稳定。如果框架以任何方式变得不完整，例如被烧毁、压碎或翻倒，传送门就会立即关闭。",
	"You can maintain a maximum of 6 gateways at one time. Each gateway can only be linked to one other one, creating a two-way portal. Any creature that can fit within a portal travels through it when they come into contact with it. A gateway's portal can be deactivated with a 1-minute ritual, allowing them to be linked with a different gateway, or simply switched off for a time.": "你在同一时间最多可以维护6个网关。每个通道只能与另一个通道相连，形成一个双向的传送门。任何能够适应传送门的生物在接触到它时都会穿越它。一个门户的传送门可以通过1分钟的仪式来停用，允许它们与另一个门户相连，或者干脆关闭一段时间。",

	"You have become linked to one or more of the elemental planes, the four sources of elemental power in the multiverse. Maybe their simple purity of form calls out to a longing for simplicity within you, or maybe your fiery spirit or fluid world-view finds itself most at home among these planes. Regardless, you have amassed a great knowledge of these planes and their most powerful locations, and can draw upon them with your portals.": "你已经与一个或多个元素位面相联系，这是多元宇宙中元素力量的四个来源。也许它们简单纯粹的形式呼唤着你内心对简单的渴望，也许你火热的精神或流动的世界观在这些星球中找到了自己的家。无论如何，你已经积累了关于这些位面和它们最强大的位置的丰富知识，并且可以通过你的传送门来利用它们。",
	"At 3rd level when you choose this link, you begin to use your portals to bring forth the powers of the Elemental Planes. When you hit a creature with a {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} attack, you can expend a use of your Portal Arts to send your weapon or missile through one of the elemental planes before it reaches your target. This attack deals an additional {@damage 3d6} cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage.": "在3级的时候，当你选择这个链接时，你开始使用你的传送门来带来元素界的力量。当你用{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}的攻击击中一个生物时，你可以消耗一次你的传送门术，在你的武器或导弹到达目标之前，将其送入一个元素界。这次攻击会造成额外的{@damage 3d6}冷、火、闪电或毒伤害。",

	"You open a large portal above you through which the burning sky of the Elemental Plane of Fire shows clearly. Six motes of blazing inferno come forth from the portal. Each mote of fire targets a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw for each mote of fire targeting it, taking {@damage 4d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. You can direct the motes of fire to hit one creature or several.": "你在上方打开了一个巨大的传送门，通过这个传送门，火元素界的燃烧天空清晰可见。六颗炽热的地狱之火从传送门里出来。每个火球的目标是在你周围60英尺内你所看到的一个生物。该生物必须为每一个针对它的火苗做一个灵巧的救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到{@damage 4d6}的火焰伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。你可以引导火舌击中一个或多个生物。",
