	"Arrows rain down around her as she runs towards the hobgoblins. Desperate to close the distance, the half-orc fights through the sting of a dozen cuts to reach her foes. The pain only makes her stronger. As she descends on the snarling pack she swings wildly, knocking several hobgoblins off their feet and sending the rest scattering before her.": "当她跑向霍比特人时，她周围的箭如雨下。不顾一切地拉近距离，半兽人在十几道伤口的刺痛中挣扎，以达到她的敌人。痛苦只会让她更强大。当她冲向咆哮的狼群时，她疯狂地挥舞着拳头，将几个妖精打倒在地，并将其余的妖精赶到她面前。",
	"The human braces himself for the impact as the orc rushes him. Then the monster makes a mistake, telegraphing its next move, and that's all the opening the human needs. He ducks beneath the orc's wide swing then raises both hands high above his head and brings them down on the orc's back, forcing the brute to the ground.": "当兽人冲向他时，人类为冲击力做好了准备。然后，怪物犯了一个错误，预示着它的下一个动作，这就是人类需要的所有开口。他躲在兽人的大摇大摆之下，然后将两只手高高举过头顶，落在兽人的背上，迫使这个野蛮人倒地。",
	"The dwarf smiles broadly and chuckles as the petty noble raises his hand to strike him for the impudent remark. Quick as a flash, the dwarf shatters the bottle in his hand against the bar and brandishes it before the noble. The young dandy flinches, stumbles backward, and runs away as the dwarf turns back to the bar to order another round.": "矮人宽厚地笑着，当小贵族举起手要为他的无礼之言而打他时，他笑了起来。矮人以迅雷不及掩耳之势，将手中的酒瓶砸向吧台，并在贵族面前挥舞起来。这个年轻的花花公子楞了一下，向后踉跄了一下，然后跑开了，这时矮子转身回到吧台，又点了一轮酒。",
	"Wherever they come from, pugilists live a rough and tumble life that leaves them full of determination and reckless, either from overconfidence or desperation. In a fight they can channel this strength of character to dig deep and fight off foes with greater strength of numbers, arms, or armor than anyone else would think possible.": "无论他们来自哪里，拳击手都过着粗犷的生活，使他们充满了决心和鲁莽，要么是过度自信，要么是绝望。在战斗中，他们可以引导这种性格的力量深入挖掘，以更大的人数、武器或盔甲的力量击退敌人，这是其他人认为可能的。",
	"Pugilists unconsciously tap into their own inner strength in the form of moxie. This is not an esoteric or mystical energy that flows through the multiverse, but the result of determination forged over a lifetime of hardship with a never-say-die attitude. You can teach someone how to fight but you could never teach someone how to be a pugilist. The secret of mastering moxie doesn't come from disciplined study or rigorous training, it comes from years of wanting and needing": "拳击手不自觉地以勇气的形式挖掘自己的内在力量。这不是一种流经多元宇宙的深奥或神秘的能量，而是以永不言败的态度在一生的艰难困苦中锻造出的决心的结果。你可以教人如何打架，但你永远无法教人如何成为一个拳击手。掌握艾力的秘密不是来自于有规律的学习或严格的训练，而是来自于多年的渴望和需要。",
	"Every city in the worlds of D&D has its back alleys, its underground fighting rackets, its ghettos. The pugilists who live in these places don't have time to consider the lofty ideals of philosophy or ponder the mysteries of the universe. The pugilists, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, spend all their time chasing down their next meal or, if they're fortunate enough to have that, their next drink, bedfellow, or flophouse.": "D&D世界中的每个城市都有它的小巷，它的地下格斗组织，它的贫民区。生活在这些地方的拳手们没有时间考虑哲学的崇高理想，也没有时间思考宇宙的奥秘。在错误的轨道上长大的拳击手们，把所有的时间都花在了追逐他们的下一顿饭上，或者，如果他们足够幸运的话，他们的下一杯酒，床伴，或者妓院。",
	"For pugilists, becoming an adventurer might be the only way out of whatever miserable situation they've been stuck in since infancy. For others, getting lost out in the world is an escape from the tangled web of debt or enemies they've piled up. Other pugilists fight because it's the only thing they know how to do. Whatever the reason for their adventuring, pugilists are as excited by the prospect of throwing punches as they are spending every last gold coin they earn.": "对于拳击手来说，成为一名冒险家可能是摆脱他们自幼就陷入的任何悲惨境地的唯一途径。对另一些人来说，迷失在这个世界上是对他们所堆积的债务或敌人的纠缠的一种逃避。另一些拳击手则是因为这是他们唯一知道如何做的事情。无论他们冒险的原因是什么，拳击手们对挥舞拳头的前景感到兴奋，就像他们花掉自己赚到的每一个金币一样。",
	"No one becomes as tough as a pugilist without enduring terrible hardship and persevering. For a pugilist, suffering is a catalyst that reveals their unbreakable spirit and strength. These hardships also influence a pugilist in other ways. If you were raised on the street, you might have a special interest in looking after the poor and destitute. If you were jailed for a crime you didn't commit, your relationship with the town guard might be more antagonistic than the average adventurer. Like so many other pugilists, your will was forged in the fires of adversity. What did you learn about yourself when you came out the other side? How does that experience continue to influence you today?": "如果不忍受可怕的困难和坚持不懈的努力，没有人会变得像拳击手那样坚韧。对于一个拳击手来说，苦难是一种催化剂，揭示了他们坚不可摧的精神和力量。这些艰难困苦也在其他方面影响着一个格斗家。如果你是在街头长大的，你可能对照顾穷人和赤贫者有特殊的兴趣。如果你因为没有犯过罪而被关进监狱，你与镇上警卫的关系可能比一般的冒险家更加对立。就像许多其他的搏斗者一样，你的意志是在逆境的火焰中锻造出来的。当你从另一边走出来时，你对自己学到了什么？这种经历今天如何继续影响你？",

	"Every hard-fighting hero needs a refuge where they can relax and rejuvenate. For pugilists, these sanctuaries tend to be disreputable. You might head to your favorite dive to indulge in your vice of choice or fraternize with the common folk. Some pugilists find the only way they can truly unwind is by getting bloodied in a fight. Others have a quiet side that few outside their closest companions ever see.": "每个努力战斗的英雄都需要一个避难所，在那里他们可以放松和恢复活力。对于拳击手来说，这些避难所往往是不光彩的。你可能会去你最喜欢的潜水馆，沉迷于你选择的恶习或与普通人交朋友。一些拳击手发现，他们能够真正放松的唯一方式是在战斗中流血。其他人则有安静的一面，除了他们最亲密的伙伴之外，很少有人看到。",

Add to this most pugilists come from humble beginnings and it's easy to see why the public comes up with such colorful stories about them.": "拳击手经常成为谣言和猜测的对象。他们坚韧不拔的精神、强大的力量和潇洒的表现使他们成为当地小酒馆里的热门话题。再加上大多数拳击手出身卑微，很容易理解为什么公众会对他们产生如此丰富多彩的故事。",

	"As you build your pugilist, consider how you came to be a bare knuckle brawler. Did you learn to fight to defend yourself? Was scraping the natural result of your nose for trouble? Or did you learn to fight as a way of intimidating and controlling others? Were you fighting for the entertainment, or did you fight because you had to? Did you try to become a more traditional martial artist but just couldn't hack it? Pugilists are a rowdy bunch that like to brag about how they learned to fight, so you better have a good story to tell.": "当你建立你的格斗家时，考虑你是如何成为一个赤手空拳的斗士的。你学会打架是为了保护自己吗？刮伤是你找麻烦的自然结果吗？或者你学习打架是为了恐吓和控制他人？你是为了娱乐而打架，还是因为不得不打？你是否试图成为一个更传统的武术家，但就是无法驾驭它？拳击手是一群喜欢吹嘘自己如何学会打架的人，所以你最好有一个好的故事来讲述。",
	"What events in your life gave you the sheer determination and will that pugilists call on? Did you spend every day hustling on the street to make ends meet? Were you forgotten and ignored by your family? Were you an outsider in your community who had to constantly struggle against the ignorant stereotypes the people there had of you? The most important element of the pugilist is that they are driven.
