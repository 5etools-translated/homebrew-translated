	"A man stands at a pair of doors sealed from the other side. He pulls out his deck of cards and shuffles them before pulling a card off the top. The card starts to glow in his hand. He slips it between the doors and steps back. The card explodes, leaving the door in pieces. A woman runs down the street being chased by a group of thugs. She pulls out her deck of cards and quickly shuffles. She pulls the top card. The card starts to glow. She drops it on the ground. A moment later, as the thugs run over the card, the card explodes, taking the thugs out. A battle rages upon a blood-soaked field overlooked by a regal keep. In its center, stands a lone battle-worn tiefling fighting for his life. A pair of hulking spectral arms sprout from his back, allowing the tiefling to wield four axes at once. He charges into a group of soldiers, wreathing himself in flames as the lone figure carves into the enemy line. Each step taken could be his last, yet the tiefling fights with the widest of grins.": "一个人站在一对从另一边封住的门前。他拿出他的扑克牌，洗了洗，然后从上面抽出一张牌。这张牌在他的手中开始发亮。他把它塞到门之间，然后退后一步。这张牌爆炸了，让门变成了碎片。一个女人在街上跑，被一群暴徒追赶。她掏出她的牌，迅速洗牌。她抽出最上面的牌。这张牌开始发亮。她把它丢在地上。一会儿，当暴徒们从牌上跑过时，这张牌爆炸了，把暴徒们都干掉了。一场战斗在一个被鲜血浸透的场地上激烈地进行着，在这个场地上可以看到一个高贵的城堡。在战斗的中心，站着一个孤独的、饱经战火的铁皮人在为自己的生命而战。一对巨大的幽灵手臂从他的背上长出，让这个铁皮人可以同时挥舞四把斧头。他冲向一群士兵，当这个孤独的身影切入敌人的阵营时，他用火焰包裹着自己。每一步都可能是他的最后一步，但这个铁皮人却带着最灿烂的笑容战斗。",

This link is more than a feeling it's magic, you can use your soul to charge the cards into bombs.": "一副牌被洗的声音是你灵魂的音乐。牌在你手中的感觉就像刺客手中的匕首一样自然。牌是你的工具，你的武器，和你的焦点。在你的手中，你的灵魂进入牌中，把它们从普通的牌变成更多的东西。这种联系不仅仅是一种感觉，它是一种魔法，你可以用你的灵魂把牌变成炸弹。",

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover by discarding your cards. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Card Slinger level (rounded up). For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can discard up 10 cards and recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st—level spell slots. Discarding a card removes it from the deck until you complete a long rest.
