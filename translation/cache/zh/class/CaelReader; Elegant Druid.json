	"Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.": "一个精灵高举着缠绕着冬青的虬枝法杖，召唤出暴风雨的怒火，召唤出爆炸性的闪电，击打威胁她的森林的持火把的兽人。",
	"Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.": "一个人类以豹子的形态蹲在高高的树枝上，从丛林中窥视着邪恶元素空气神庙的奇怪建筑，密切关注着邪教分子的活动。",
	"Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.": "一个半精灵挥舞着由纯火形成的刀刃，冲向一大群骷髅兵，粉碎了赋予这些肮脏的生物以嘲弄的生命外观的非自然魔法。",
	"Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.": "无论是召唤自然界的元素力量还是模仿动物世界的生物，德鲁伊都是自然界的韧性、狡猾和愤怒的化身。他们并不声称自己掌握了自然。相反，他们认为自己是自然界不屈不挠的意志的延伸。",
	"Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.": "德鲁伊最崇尚自然，他们的法术和其他魔法力量要么来自自然的力量本身，要么来自自然神灵。许多德鲁伊人追求的是一种与自然超然结合的神秘灵性，而不是对一个神圣实体的奉献，而其他人则是为野生自然、动物或元素力量的神明服务。古老的德鲁伊传统有时被称为古老的信仰，与寺庙和神龛中的神灵崇拜形成对比。",
	"Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.": "德鲁伊的法术以自然和动物为导向--牙齿和爪子的力量，太阳和月亮的力量，火和风暴的力量。德鲁伊也获得了化身为动物的能力，一些德鲁伊对这种做法进行了特别的研究，甚至到了喜欢动物形态而不是自然形态的地步。",
	"For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.": "对德鲁伊来说，自然界存在着一种不稳定的平衡。构成世界的四种元素--空气、土、火和水--必须保持平衡。如果一个元素获得了超越其他元素的力量，世界就会被摧毁，被卷入其中一个元素位面，并被分解成其组成元素。因此，德鲁伊反对元素邪恶的邪教和其他提倡一种元素而排斥其他元素的人。",
	"Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.": "德鲁伊还关注维持植物和动物生命的微妙的生态平衡，以及文明人与自然和谐相处的需要，而不是与之对抗。德鲁伊接受自然界中残酷的东西，他们憎恨非自然的东西，包括反常者（如beholders和mind flayers）和亡灵（如僵尸和吸血鬼）。德鲁伊有时会带领突击队对付这种生物，特别是当这些怪物侵犯德鲁伊的领地时。",
	"Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.": "德鲁伊经常被发现守卫圣地或看守未受破坏的自然区域。但当出现重大危险，威胁到自然界的平衡或他们所保护的土地时，德鲁伊就会作为冒险者，在打击威胁方面发挥更积极的作用。",
	"When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.": "在制作德鲁伊时，要考虑为什么你的角色与自然有如此密切的联系。也许你的角色生活在一个旧信仰仍然兴盛的社会，或者在被遗弃在森林深处后被德鲁伊抚养长大。也许你的角色曾与自然之灵有过戏剧性的接触，与巨鹰或恶狼面对面，并在经历中幸存下来。也许你的角色出生在一场史诗般的风暴或火山爆发期间，这被解释为成为德鲁伊是你角色命运的一部分的标志。",
	"Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.": "你一直都是冒险家，这是你德鲁伊召唤的一部分，还是你最初是作为神圣丛林或泉水的看守人？也许你的家乡被邪恶所玷污，你开始了冒险生活，希望找到一个新的家园或目标。",
	"You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background hermit} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一个德鲁伊。首先，智慧应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"Most druids eschew the usage of metal, instead using organic materials such as bone, hide, and wood for their tools, weapons, and armor. Equipment that is normally forged of metal, such as medium armor, can occasionaly be found crafted by druids out of these more primal materials.": "大多数德鲁伊避免使用金属，而是使用有机材料，如骨、皮和木头作为他们的工具、武器和盔甲。通常由金属锻造的装备，如中型盔甲，偶尔可以发现德鲁伊用这些更原始的材料来制作。",
	"The few druids who work more closely with civilization may choose to wear metal armor, but this is often seen as a blasphemy by more traditionalist druids. Some druids keep to more ancient metals such as copper and bronze, often maintaining pieces that are centuries old.": "少数与文明更紧密合作的德鲁伊可能会选择穿戴金属盔甲，但这往往被更多传统的德鲁伊视为一种亵渎。一些德鲁伊坚持使用更古老的金属，如铜和青铜，经常保持有几个世纪之久的作品。",
	"This overhaul of the Druid class is born out of my experiences with both the base class and my previous druid rework. Inspired by the game 13th Age, I realized that I really disliked that Wild Shape relied on external creature statblocks to function, which caused a whole bunch of problems:": "这次对德鲁伊等级的改造是在我对基础等级和之前的德鲁伊改造的经验中产生的。受游戏《13世纪》的启发，我意识到我真的不喜欢《野性之形》依赖外部生物状态块来运作，这造成了一大堆问题。",
	"Early-game, a druid player is presented with way too many options, causing analysis paralysis. Late-game, a druid has far too few options, pigeonholing them into certain beasts. I don't think bloating the game with a bunch more high CR beasts is a good solution.": "游戏初期，德鲁伊玩家会有太多的选择，导致分析瘫痪。在游戏后期，德鲁伊的选择太少，使他们只能选择某些野兽。我不认为用更多的高CR兽来充实游戏是一个好的解决方案。",
	"Even with the analysis paralysis of low CRs, there are still gaps where a druid can't turn into say, a CR 2 Wolf, without doing some reflavoring of an unrelated statblock.": "即使在低CRs的分析瘫痪的情况下，仍然有差距，德鲁伊不能变成例如CR2的狼，而不对不相关的状态块做一些重新塑造。",
	"Druid is already a full caster that expects you to learn the casting system and druid spells, it shouldn't have a second workload of looking up and learning how beast statblocks work.": "德鲁伊已经是一个完整的施法者，希望你学习施法系统和德鲁伊法术，它不应该有第二个工作量，即查找和学习野兽状态块的工作。",
	"This core feature of the class is now pegged to Monster Design, which does not, and shouldn't, follow the same rules as PC Design. This stifles the design both for the Druid and for Beasts in the system.": "这个等级的核心特征现在被挂在了怪物设计上，而怪物设计并不，也不应该遵循与PC设计相同的规则。这就扼杀了系统中德鲁伊和野兽的设计。",
	"New books, sometimes adventure modules, with new beasts come out and suddenly your druid is stronger or more versatile? You end up referencing more books than a Wizard!": "新的书籍，有时是冒险模块，有新的野兽出现，你的德鲁伊突然变得更强或更多才多艺？你最终参考的书比巫师还多！\"。",
	"The core of Elegant Druid is the new Wild Shape mechanics, which use an internal, level-scaling statblock for any beast you turn into, that you then add-on an appropiate Aspect to customize into a wolf or an elk or a bear or what have you. This has a number of beneficial effects:": "优雅德鲁伊的核心是新的 \"野性形状 \"机制，它为你变成的任何野兽使用了一个内部的、等级缩放的状态块，然后你再加上一个适当的方面来定制一个狼、麋鹿或熊或其他什么。这有许多有益的影响。",
	"You can now turn into anything you want, at any level, and you will have level-appropiate stats.": "你现在可以变成任何你想要的东西，在任何级别，而且你将拥有与级别相适应的状态。",
	"You no longer have to look up and learn statblocks in another section or in another book, everything is there in the feature.": "你不再需要在另一节或另一本书中查找和学习状态块，一切都在功能中。",
	"The split of Scout Form and Combat Form codifies the way that Wild Shape gets used in gameplay, and gives you more freedom to use wild shape for utility without giving up its combat potential.": "侦察兵形态和战斗形态的拆分编纂了野性形态在游戏中的使用方式，让你在不放弃其战斗潜力的情况下，更自由地使用野性形态进行实用。",
	"Reflavoring and customization are now built-in assumptions rather than something you're left to figure out on your own.": "重新调味和定制现在是内置的假设，而不是让你自己去弄清楚的东西。",
	"The design is much more flexible, since the Druidic Forms and Aspects can just be tuned directly, instead of being at the mercy of how statblocks are written. Subclasses also have a much easier job of hooking into your core defining class feature.": "这种设计更加灵活，因为德鲁伊形态和方面可以直接进行调整，而不是受状态块编写方式的支配。子类也更容易与你的核心定义类特征挂钩。",
	"I also have always felt that that Moon/Land split made for something of an unsatisfying dichotomy within the class. Elegant Druid's Combat Form statblock is designed to be somewhere between the default and PHB Moon Druid's scaling, which should make it useful for all druids regardless of subclass. Moon Druid is the still the master of the Combat Form but you are not forced to pick it in order to have reasonable combat stats. Land Druid has been overhauled and given much more appealing features, as well as the defining ability to cast their circle spells even while in wild shape.": "我也一直觉得月球/土地的划分在这个等级中造成了一些不令人满意的二分法。优雅德鲁伊的战斗形态属性块被设计成介于默认和PHB月球德鲁伊的比例之间，这应该使它对所有德鲁伊都有用，不管是什么子类。月亮德鲁伊仍然是战斗形态的主人，但你不会为了拥有合理的战斗状态而被迫选择它。陆地德鲁伊已经被彻底改造，并被赋予了更多吸引人的特征，以及即使在野生状态下也能施放他们的圆圈法术的决定性能力。",
	"Overall, while this is merely version 1, it should provide a much more flexible and self-contained druid experience, with less homework and more meaningful choices.": "总的来说，虽然这只是第一版，但它应该提供一个更加灵活和独立的德鲁伊体验，有更少的家庭作业和更有意义的选择。",

	"Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.": "即使在死亡中，每个生物都在维持大平衡中发挥自己的作用。但现在，一种不平衡在增长，一种试图控制自然的力量在增长。这就是凡人种族的破坏性行为。他们的行为离自然越远，他们的影响就越腐败。作为德鲁伊，我们主要寻求保护和教育，以维护大平衡，但有时我们必须奋起反抗危险，消除它。",
	"Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.": "德鲁伊是自然界的守护者，据说随着时间的推移，德鲁伊会成为自然的声音，说出一般人听不到的微妙真相。许多成为德鲁伊的人发现，他们自然而然地倾向于自然；自然的力量、周期和运动使他们的思想和精神充满了好奇和洞察力。许多圣人和智者都研究过自然，写了很多关于其神秘和力量的文章，但德鲁伊是一种特殊的存在：在某些时候，他们开始体现这些自然力量，产生神奇的现象，将他们与自然的精神和生命的流动联系起来。由于他们奇怪而神秘的力量，德鲁伊常常被周围的人敬重、回避或认为是危险的。",
	"Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.": "你的德鲁伊角色可能是一个真正的自然崇拜者，一个一直蔑视文明并在野外找到安慰的人。或者你的角色可能是一个城市的孩子，现在努力使文明世界与荒野和谐。你可以使用下面的章节来充实你的德鲁伊，无论你的角色是如何来到这个职业的。",
	"Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.": "有些德鲁伊会携带一件或多件对他们来说是神圣的或具有深刻个人意义的物品。这种物品不一定有魔力，但每一件都是一件物品，其意义将德鲁伊的思想和心灵与一个深刻的概念或精神面貌联系在一起。",
	"When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?": "当你决定你的角色的珍贵物品是什么时，考虑给它一个起源故事：你是如何得到这个物品的，为什么它对你很重要？",

You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.": "许多德鲁伊感到与自然界的一个特定方面有很强的联系，比如一个水体、一种动物、一种树木或其他一些植物。你认同你所选择的方面；通过它的行为或它的性质，它树立了一个你试图效仿的榜样。",
	"Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth.": "紫杉树提醒你更新你的思想和精神，让旧的死去，新的涌现。",

	"It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.": "对于未来的德鲁伊来说，寻找（或被寻找）教官或长老教他们魔法艺术的基本知识是很正常的。大多数向导师学习的德鲁伊在年轻时就开始训练，导师在塑造学生的态度和信仰方面具有重要作用。",

Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?": "如果你的角色接受了别人的训练，那么这个人是谁或什么，你们之间的关系是什么性质的？你的导师是否给你灌输了特定的观点，或以其他方式影响你实现所选道路目标的方法？",

	"Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.": "同样，德鲁伊用这种木材来制作其他物品，如武器和盾牌。紫杉与死亡和重生有关，所以弯刀或镰刀的武器把手可能是用它制作的。灰木与生命有关，橡木与力量有关。这些木材可以制作出色的手杖或整个武器，如棍棒或四分法，以及盾牌。桤木与空气有关，它可以用来制作投掷武器，如飞镖或标枪。",

	"If your druidic form is instantly killed or reduced to 0 hitpoints by an effect that normally kills you outright when it does so, such as the {@spell disintegrate} or {@spell power word kill} spells, you instead revert to your normal form, and are not killed.": "如果你的德鲁伊形态被一个通常会直接杀死你的效果（如{@spell disintegrate}或{@spell power word kill}的法术）瞬间杀死或降低到0命中率，你反而会恢复到你的正常形态，并且不会被杀死。",
	"When you shift into a form, you can determine its appearance, but it always looks slightly different than a natural version. The forms of many druids take on aspects of their personal appearance, but you can customize it as you desire, within reasonable limitations of the form's anatomy. For example, your lion form may have golden feathers and an ethereal tail, but it (normally) wouldn't have wings or humanoid hands. These customizations are entirely cosmetic and do not change your form's statistics.": "当你转变为一种形态时，你可以决定它的外观，但它看起来总是与自然版本略有不同。许多德鲁伊的形态都具有他们个人的外表，但你可以在形态的解剖学的合理限制范围内，按你的愿望定制它。例如，你的狮子形态可能有金色的羽毛和空灵的尾巴，但它（通常）不会有翅膀或人形的手。这些定制完全是外观上的，不会改变你的形态的统计数据。",
	"A creature that is suspicious of your form can make a contested Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check against your Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check to determine that you are in fact a shapeshifted druid rather than a naturally curious animal. A fellow druid automatically succeeds on this check (and so do you, if you are making it against another druid in their form).": "一个对你的形态产生怀疑的生物可以对你的智力（%0%）进行有争议的智力检查，以确定你实际上是一个变形的德鲁伊，而不是一个天生好奇的动物。同行的德鲁伊在这个检查中自动成功（如果你对另一个德鲁伊的形态进行检查的话，你也会成功）。",
	"Scout Forms—like Cats, Hawks, Cuttlefish, Spiders, Owls, and Foxes—are critters that can readily maneuver around terrain, scout areas easily, and spy on potential enemies while hiding in plain sight.

You also choose between Tiny and Small for your form's size.": "像猫、鹰、墨鱼、蜘蛛、猫头鹰和狐狸这样的侦察型动物，可以很容易地绕过地形，轻松地侦察区域，并在隐藏在众目睽睽之下窥探潜在的敌人。侦察兵形态不适合战斗，缺乏有效的攻击，甚至能被普通的捕食者从空中拍下。当你变身为你的侦察兵形态时，你会采用下面的状态块，选择地面或水。每个选项都赋予你的侦察兵形态以额外的特性，使其适应不同的环境。你还可以选择 \"小 \"和 \"小 \"作为你形态的尺寸。",

Combat Forms might have special movement modes and senses, but their primary purpose is to do battle. When you transform into your Combat Form, you adopt the statblock below, and you choose a Form Aspect. The Aspect determines the general anatomy of your combat form, and you gain the listed traits of the aspect while in the form. You also choose between Medium and Large for your form's size.": "战斗形态--如熊、大象、黑豹、巨型猫头鹰或狼--是可怕的野兽，有助于撕裂敌人和抵御他们的攻击。战斗形态可能有特殊的运动模式和感官，但它们的主要目的是进行战斗。当你变成你的战斗形态时，你会采用下面的状态块，并选择一个形态方面。形态特征决定了你战斗形态的一般解剖结构，你在形态中会获得所列举的特征。你还可以选择中型和大型作为你的形态的尺寸。",
	"When you assume a combat form you also choose the anatomy and extra traits of your new form, called an aspect.
