Choose your variant rules carefully, and consider how they might impact Pact Magic as a whole in your campaign.": "本章介绍了一些变体规则，当你把契约魔法引入你的战役时，你可以使用这些规则。其中有些规则，比如多类规则，是为了巩固装订机在更复杂的构建中的使用，而像装订的特殊要求这样的规则，则是为了让人回想起原版《魔法之书》装订机的一些复杂性（包括在机制和传说中的复杂性）。仔细选择你的变体规则，并考虑它们在你的战役中可能对整个契约魔法产生的影响。",

	"Rather than rolling a Charisma check to bind a vestige, you can willingly relinquish your soul to it, and accept a poor pact. Doing so affords you some control over the vestige's Influence. You, rather than the DM, chooses which one of the vestige's Influences affects you, and you can change this selection at will.": "与其滚动魅力检查来绑定一个遗迹，你可以心甘情愿地把你的灵魂交给它，并接受一个可怜的契约。这样做可以让你在一定程度上控制这个遗迹的影响力。你，而不是DM，可以选择哪个遗迹的影响来影响你，而且你可以随意改变这个选择。",
	"Many vestiges are as old as time itself, and hold deep, personal grudges against other vestiges.

Use this optional rule if you want to roleplay pact-making with greater depth.": "许多遗迹和时间本身一样古老，并对其他遗迹怀有深深的个人怨恨。例如，普利姆斯（Primus）是被特尼布罗斯（Tenebrous）杀死的，如果特尼布罗斯被束缚，他就不会回应你的召唤。其他遗迹有特定的仪式，他们要求他们的绑定者在被召唤前执行。如果你想对契约的制定进行更深入的角色扮演，请使用这一可选的规则。",

	"When he finally spoke, it was with the voices of several beings at once, overlapping in an unnatural harmony. But the most prominent voice was gruff and confident, which he used to lull his targets into complacency seconds before he struck with a hidden dagger. By the next morning, the gruff, independent voice was gone, instead replaced with a robotic monotone. He discarded the daggers too, in favor of a heavy mace and imposing armor. The day after that, he struck an air of profound melancholy, and he abandoned weapons altogether to throw lightning from his fingertips. Each morning, he woke up new, possessed by some new infernal spirit, dead god, or forgotten sinner.": "当他终于开口说话时，是用几个人的声音同时说话，以一种不自然的和谐方式重叠在一起。但最突出的声音是粗暴而自信的，在他用隐藏的匕首攻击前几秒钟，他用这种声音来哄骗他的目标，使其自满。到了第二天早上，那个粗暴、独立的声音已经消失了，取而代之的是一种机器人式的单音。他也丢弃了匕首，转而使用沉重的长矛和气派的盔甲。此后的一天，他打出了一种深沉的忧郁气息，他完全放弃了武器，从指尖抛出闪电。每天早晨，他都会醒来，被一些新的地狱之魂、死去的神或被遗忘的罪人所占有。",
	"Binders are students of Pact Magic, an ancient and secret lore that allows them to call to entities that live beyond the known planes, in the spaces between the worlds. Through a combination of forgotten magic and complex bargains, they persuade or compel these beings to serve them–though not always without a price.": "装订者是契约魔法的学生，一种古老而秘密的传说，使他们能够召唤生活在已知世界之外、世界之间的实体。通过结合被遗忘的魔法和复杂的交易，他们说服或迫使这些生命为他们服务--尽管并非总是没有代价。",
	"Binders learn to cast their minds into the Void between planes, and to search the abyss there for beings that will answer their call. These beings–called vestiges–are remnants of powerful beings residing in the nothingness outside of reality, which is born from the last echoes of the world's creation, and from energies that leak out of the planes. Pact Magic scholars seek out these vestiges and pass down legends of their origin. They learn of their personalities, abilities, and motivations, all of which vary wildly, from the reasonable, to deeply inscrutable.": "捆绑者学会将他们的思想投射到位面之间的虚空中，并在那里的深渊中搜寻会回应他们召唤的生命。这些生命被称为 \"遗迹\"，是居住在现实之外的虚无中的强大生命的残余，它诞生于世界创造的最后回声，以及从各层面泄漏出来的能量。契约魔法学者们寻找这些残余，并流传着关于他们起源的传说。他们了解他们的个性、能力和动机，所有这些都千差万别，从合理到深奥莫测。",
	"Because vestiges are devoid of all sensation in the Void, they crave any small taste of reality, and will answer the call of any binder powerful enough to draw them forth. Binders, so named for their willingness to share their spirit with these exiled spirits, can merge a portion of their soul with a vestige in exchange for some of the power the vestige commanded in life.": "因为遗迹在虚空中没有任何感觉，他们渴望任何现实的小滋味，并且会响应任何足够强大的捆绑者的召唤，把他们拉出来。捆绑者因愿意与这些被放逐的灵魂分享他们的精神而得名，他们可以将自己的一部分灵魂与遗迹合并，以换取遗迹生前的一些力量。",
	"In order to obtain the services of a vestige, a binder must strike a deal with that vestige, and use their magic to make the terms of the agreement totally binding. Knowing this, the vestiges will often seek to outwit the binder, adding loopholes and ambiguity into the terms of the bargain, making every deal a grave risk for the binder.": "为了获得一个遗迹的服务，粘合剂必须与该遗迹达成交易，并使用他们的魔法使协议的条款完全具有约束力。知道这一点后，遗迹往往会设法智取保释人，在交易条款中增加漏洞和模糊性，使每笔交易对保释人来说都有严重的风险。",
	"As you make your binder character, spend some time thinking about your relationship to your vestiges, and the extent to which you allow them to influence your personality. How did you learn about the mysterious vestiges, and do you have a special relationship to any of them? What drew you to your first summoning? How do you view your own soul, given that you allow other spirits to take up residence within it?": "在你塑造你的活页夹角色时，花一些时间思考你与你的遗迹的关系，以及你允许它们影响你的个性的程度。你是如何了解到这些神秘的遗迹的，你与它们中的任何一个有特殊关系吗？是什么吸引了你的第一次召唤？鉴于你允许其他灵体在你的灵魂中居住，你如何看待自己的灵魂？",
	"Work with your DM to determine what role vestiges and other binders will play in your campaign.": "与你的管理部门合作，确定遗迹和其他活页纸在你的活动中会扮演什么角色。",
	"As a binder, you can redefine your role in the adventuring party, daily, if desired. There is also the possibility that your appearance and your very personality will flex with different vestiges holding sway over your soul. How do you and your adventuring party confront this, and how do you handle the physical signs presented by your vestiges? Do you hide these signs, for fear of public retribution, or do you flaunt them, embracing the power that they offer you?": "作为一个装订者，如果愿意，你可以每天重新定义你在冒险党中的角色。还有一种可能性是，你的外表和你的个性会随着不同的残余物对你的灵魂的支配而发生弯曲。你和你的冒险团如何面对这一点，你如何处理你的残余物所呈现的身体迹象？你是隐藏这些迹象，因为害怕公众的报复，还是炫耀它们，拥抱它们提供给你的力量？",
	"To make a Binder quickly, consider the following suggestions: Charisma should be your highest stat, followed by a medium balance of Constitution, and Strength and Dexterity. Because you can take any party role, you should be prepared to change your hat on a moment's notice. Physical stats will be more important for if you plan to take the Twisted or Sealed Fate. Lastly, choose the Sage Background.": "要快速制作一个活页夹，请考虑以下建议。魅力应该是你的最高属性，其次是中等平衡的体质，以及力量和灵活性。因为你可以担任任何一方的角色，所以你应该准备好在一瞬间改变你的帽子。如果你打算采取扭曲或封印的命运，物理状态将更为重要。最后，选择贤者背景。",

	"While you bear Amon's sign, your horns are strong and sturdy. You can attack a creature with these horns as an unarmed strike, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Additionally, if you move in a straight line for 10 feet immediately before attacking creature with your horns, that creature must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.": "当你带着阿蒙的标志时，你的角是强壮而结实的。你可以用这些角攻击一个生物，作为非武装攻击，击中后造成1d4的击打伤害。此外，如果你在用你的角攻击生物之前在一条直线上移动了10英尺，该生物必须做一个力量救赎动作，否则就会被击倒（%0%）。",
	"You can breathe fire upon your foes as an action. Each creature within a 10-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.": "你可以对你的敌人喷火作为一个动作。在10英尺范围内的每个生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。如果救赎失败，该生物会受到1d6的火焰伤害，如果救赎成功，则受到一半的伤害。",
	"Alternatively, you can hold your fiery breath as an action for up to 1 round, maintaining concentration on it as you would a spell. You can release it as an action on your following turn, rolling twice the normal number of damage dice.": "或者，你可以将你的火热呼吸作为一个动作保持1个回合，像施法一样保持对它的注意力。你可以在下一回合以行动的方式释放它，滚动两倍于正常数量的伤害骰子。",

	"The legends tell that Karsus was once a mortal spellcaster, one of the strongest who ever lived. Using his magic, he attempted to usurp a goddess of magic from her throne. Remarkably, he succeeded, but his not yet immortal body could not bear wielding the goddess's unfathomable power. He erupted into pure magical energy, leaving behind no traces save for the wound the explosion left on the very tapestry of magic.

	"Though he achieved some measure of distraction from the endlessness of the Void from the few binders that can contact him, Karsus despises them: after all, he was once a god, even if only for a moment, and being forced to act at the whim of an impertinent mortal is nearly too much to bear. To this end, he makes more solid pacts with those few who can both contact him and who would bow in supplication before him: while warlocks are neither believers nor worshipers, they are at least short-sighted enough to serve only him.": "虽然他从少数能与他联系的捆绑者那里获得了某种程度的分心，但卡萨斯鄙视他们：毕竟他曾经是个神，哪怕只是一瞬间，而被迫按照一个无礼的凡人的意愿行事，几乎让人无法忍受。为此，他与那些既能与他联系又愿意在他面前鞠躬祈求的少数人签订了更牢固的契约：虽然术士们既不是信徒也不是崇拜者，但他们至少目光短浅，只为他服务。",
