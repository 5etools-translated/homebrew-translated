	"With murderous goblins pouring in from all sides, threatening to overrun the flanks, the battle-hardened warlord, clad in dented and scratched armor, raises her voice to shout commands that rally her allies. Although blood streaks their faces and their bodies bristle with arrows, the warlord's companions rally, regaining their mettle to push back against the brutal onslaught. What once seemed certain defeat became a victory achieved against all odds.": "凶残的地精从四面八方涌来，威胁着侧翼，身穿凹陷和划痕的盔甲、身经百战的军阀提高嗓门喊出命令，集结她的盟友。尽管他们脸上血迹斑斑，身上箭矢横飞，但军阀的同伴们还是团结起来，恢复了他们的勇气，向残酷的攻击发起反击。曾经看似必败的局面变成了逆境中的胜利。",
	"In another battle, an elf clad in leather armor darts in the forest to lead his companions to where the hated trolls are encamped. From out of the underbrush the company emerges, taking their enemies by surprise, peppering them mightily with arrows, bolts, stones, and spears. After the hail of missile fire the trolls recover, only to find their attackers have melted away into the woods. Enraged, the trolls ferociously charge, straight into a waiting ambush prepared by the brilliant elf commander.": "在另一场战斗中，一个身穿皮甲的精灵在森林中飞奔，带领他的同伴们来到可恨的巨魔驻扎的地方。他们从灌木丛中走出来，出其不意地攻击敌人，用箭矢、螺栓、石头和长矛猛烈攻击他们。在导弹袭击之后，巨魔们恢复过来，却发现袭击者已经消失在树林里了。被激怒的巨魔凶猛地冲锋，直接冲进了聪明的精灵指挥官准备好的伏击圈。",
	"Standing atop a sarcophagus, a dwarf armored in gleaming mail grips his axe and shakes it at the ceiling as he recites the saga of the wrongs done to his people by the orcs. With each bitter defeat and every wrong recounted, he ignites the coals of anger in the hearts of the dwarven troops assembled before him. The more the dwarf speaks, the hotter the flames burn to chase away the chill of fear and doubt, such that by the time he has finished, the gathered warriors let loose a mighty battle cry, sounding their readiness to fight.": "站在石棺上，一个身穿闪亮盔甲的矮人握着他的斧头，一边对着天花板摇晃，一边念叨着兽人对他的人民犯下的错误。每一次惨痛的失败和每一个错误的叙述，他都会点燃聚集在他面前的矮人军队心中的愤怒之火。矮人说得越多，火焰就烧得越旺，赶走了恐惧和怀疑的寒意，以至于当他说完时，聚集在一起的战士们发出了强大的战斗呼声，发出了他们准备战斗的声音。",
	"Warlords all, these characters represent just a few of the different forms these battle leaders might take. Warlords might be charismatic peasant heroes who rallied their people to overthrow tyrants, seasoned battlefield commanders who bring their experience with them when directing their allies in combat, famous warriors, figures of inspiration and more. Warlords understand battle at all levels, from small unit tactics to the grand scale of the battlefield. Capable warriors in their own right, they possess sharp minds and strong personalities, which aid them in leading their companions to success in overcoming their foes.": "所有的军阀，这些人物只是代表了这些战斗领袖可能采取的不同形式中的几个。军阀可能是有魅力的农民英雄，他们团结人民推翻暴君；也可能是经验丰富的战场指挥官，他们在指挥盟友作战时带着自己的经验；还可能是著名的战士，激励人心的人物等等。军阀们了解各个层面的战斗，从小单位的战术到战场的宏伟规模。他们本身就是有能力的战士，拥有敏锐的头脑和强烈的个性，这有助于他们带领他们的同伴成功战胜敌人。",
	"Few people willingly seek out warfare, but warlords understand all too well its unfortunate necessity. When diplomacy fails and lives hang in the balance, war might be the only recourse to right wrongs, protect the innocent, and restore order in a world gone mad. Warlords understand warfare in a way few others do. They see the patterns in strikes and counterstrikes, understand the benefits of superior positioning, and learn battle-tested techniques to keep their enemies on their heels. While warlords might regret the loss of life, they see every fight as a contest they must win, using every trick at their disposal to gain the upper hand.": "很少有人愿意寻求战争，但军阀们非常了解其不幸的必要性。当外交手段失败，生命悬于一线时，战争可能是纠正错误、保护无辜者、恢复疯狂世界秩序的唯一途径。军阀们对战争的理解是其他人所不具备的。他们看到了攻击和反击的模式，了解优势定位的好处，并学习经过战斗考验的技术，以保持他们的敌人的脚跟。虽然军阀们可能会对生命的损失感到遗憾，但他们把每一场战斗都看作是他们必须赢得的比赛，利用他们所掌握的每一个技巧来获得优势。",
	"Warlords take charge in fights. They help their allies by directing them where they can do the most good, sometimes urging them to strike at vulnerable areas or maneuvering them into position where they can gain a tactical edge. Although warlords differ in the methods they use, their presence always aids everyone who fights at their sides.": "军阀在战斗中负责任。他们帮助他们的盟友，把他们引向最有利的地方，有时敦促他们攻击脆弱的地方，或把他们引向可以获得战术优势的位置。虽然军阀们使用的方法不同，但他们的存在总是有助于在他们身边作战的每个人。",
	"Being competent leaders in battle requires that warlords have at least some basic understanding of how to acquit themselves on the battlefield. All warlords learn how to fight with a wide variety of weapons, to wear the heaviest armors, and deflect their enemies' attacks with shields. Many warlords, however, eschew the heavier gear so they can stay light on their feet to move swiftly to where their companions need them the most. Rather than specialize in certain weapons, warlords favor versatility so they can fight in whatever way they need to win the day.": "作为战斗中的合格领导者，军阀们至少要对如何在战场上表现自己有一些基本了解。所有军阀都要学习如何使用各种武器作战，穿上最重的盔甲，用盾牌抵挡敌人的攻击。然而，许多军阀放弃了较重的装备，以便他们能够保持轻盈的脚步，迅速地移动到他们的同伴最需要的地方。军阀们并不专攻某些武器，而是青睐于多功能性，这样他们就能以任何需要的方式进行战斗，从而赢得胜利。",
	"When you create a warlord, you should consider your character's background in the design choices you make. First, and perhaps the most important, is to decide what happened to point you toward the way of the warlord. You might have been just an ordinary warrior, but some quality or capability set you apart from the rest. Are you a tactical genius, possessed of a mind that can see several steps ahead in any contest? Or are you a natural leader, able to inspire others through your words and actions?": "当你创建一个军阀时，你应该在设计选择中考虑你的角色的背景。首先，也许是最重要的，是要决定发生了什么事使你走向军阀的道路。你可能只是一个普通的战士，但一些品质或能力使你与其他人不同。你是一个战术天才，拥有在任何比赛中都能提前几步看到的头脑？或者你是一个天生的领导者，能够通过你的言语和行动激励他人？",
	"In addition to determining the impetus for your development, it's also worthwhile to consider how you learned your leadership abilities. Such talents might have arisen from your natural gifts and, through trial and error, you refined them until you became the leader you are today. Then again, you might have studied at one of the great war colleges, where battle-scarred veterans instruct you in the study of history's greatest battles in order to teach you tactics, strategy, and logistics.": "除了确定你发展的动力之外，还值得考虑你是如何学会你的领导能力的。这种才能可能来自于你的天赋，通过试验和错误，你完善了它们，直到你成为今天的领导者。然后，你可能在一所伟大的战争学院学习，在那里，饱经战火的老兵指导你研究历史上最伟大的战役，以教你战术、战略和后勤。",
	"Along with your training, you had to come by your arms and armor somewhere. Did you inherit your gear from a famous ancestor? Maybe you gained your equipment upon completing your training, a gift from one of your instructors. It could be that your arms and armor are parts of a uniform, or you might have cobbled them together from pieces you found on old battlefields. Whatever you decide, your training, your weapons, and your armor help you become the battlefield leader you were born to become.": "随着你的训练，你的武器和盔甲必须从某个地方来。你的装备是由一个著名的祖先继承的吗？也许你的装备是在完成训练后获得的，是你的一个教官的礼物。你的武器和盔甲可能是制服的一部分，或者你可能是用你在旧战场上找到的碎片拼凑起来的。无论你决定如何，你的训练、你的武器和你的盔甲帮助你成为你生来就应该成为的战场领袖。",
	"If you need to put together a warlord fast, follow these suggestions. Charisma should be your highest score, followed by either Strength or Dexterity. Make Strength your second-highest if you want to focus on melee weapons or Dexterity if you want to fight with finesse or ranged weapons. Constitution should be your third highest score to improve your durability. For your background, choose soldier.": "如果你需要快速组建一个军阀，请遵循这些建议。魅力应该是你的最高分，其次是力量或灵巧。如果你想专注于近战武器，那么力量是你的第二高分；如果你想用技巧或远程武器作战，那么灵巧是你的第二高分。体质应该是你的第三高分，以提高你的耐久力。对于你的背景，选择士兵。",
	"Blood from countless conflicts stains the pages of history. From rebellions to throw off the chains of tyranny to invasions by enemy hordes, war has shaped the course of history since the earliest days of the world. As tragic as these battles are, one can learn much from the stratagems employed by both the victors and the vanquished, and from these lessons entire schools of thought have emerged, instructing commanders in the finer arts of warfare. Warlords commit themselves to one of these methods and adopt their techniques when leading the way in battle against their enemies.": "无数次冲突的鲜血染红了历史的篇章。从摆脱暴政枷锁的叛乱到敌军的入侵，从世界最早的时候起，战争就塑造了历史的进程。尽管这些战斗是悲惨的，但人们可以从胜利者和失败者采用的策略中学到很多东西，并且从这些教训中出现了整个思想流派，指导指挥官掌握更精细的战争艺术。军阀们致力于这些方法中的一种，并在与敌人作战的过程中采用他们的技术。",
	"Every conflict has its risks, dangers, and unexpected outcomes. Students of the Daring Gambler embrace the uncertainty that comes in battle, taking daring and sometimes desperate risks in the hope of securing a victory. Favoring audacious tactics, they put themselves and their allies into precarious situations only to come out on top through sheer luck. Warlords who adopt the military techniques of this stratagem tend to be bold, daring, and brimming with confidence.": "每场冲突都有其风险、危险和意外结果。大胆赌徒的学生接受战斗中的不确定性，大胆地、有时不顾一切地冒险，希望能获得胜利。他们偏爱大胆的战术，将自己和盟友置于危险的境地，只为通过纯粹的运气取得胜利。采用这种策略的军阀往往是大胆的，大胆的，充满信心的。",
	"The Stratagem of the Golden General specializes in leadership, presentation, and command. Warlords who employ this stratagem lead by example. Their accomplishments inspire others to do the same, to push beyond their normal limitations, and achieve what ordinary soldiers can't ": "金将之术擅长于领导、演讲和指挥。采用这种策略的军阀以身作则。他们的成就激励其他人也这样做，超越他们的正常限制，实现普通士兵无法实现的目标。",
	"Speed and mobility are the hallmarks of warlords who study the Stratagem of the Hordemaster. Favoring hitand-run tactics, these skirmishing warlords keep on the move to stay a step ahead of their enemies. Such mobility allows them and their fellow warriors to rain arrows and bolts upon their enemies, while thwarting any attempts to close the gap between them. By winnowing down their opponents and always keeping out of reach, they can take down the most dangerous of foes.": "速度和机动性是学习 \"霸王计 \"的军阀的特点。这些小规模的军阀喜欢打了就跑的战术，他们一直在移动，以保持领先他们的敌人一步。这样的机动性使他们和他们的同伴能够向他们的敌人发射箭矢和炮弹，同时挫败任何试图缩小他们之间差距的企图。通过压制他们的对手并始终保持距离，他们可以拿下最危险的敌人。",
	"Few battle plans ever survive intact upon the first encounter with the enemy. Chance, circumstances, and other variables can disrupt even the most lopsided conflicts, turning what should be an easy battle into a deadly one. Students of the Stratagem of the Resourceful Leader understand the harsh realities of fighting unpredictable enemies, keeping a few tricks up their sleeves to respond to whatever complications might arise. Cunning and adaptable, these warlords can always find a way out of the thorniest situations.": "很少有战斗计划能在与敌人的第一次交锋中完整地存活下来。机会、环境和其他变数甚至可以扰乱最一边倒的冲突，将本应轻松的战斗变成致命的战斗。足智多谋的领导者策略的学生了解与不可预测的敌人作战的严酷现实，在他们的袖子里保留了一些技巧来应对可能出现的任何复杂情况。狡猾和适应性强，这些军阀总能在最棘手的情况下找到出路。",
	"Warlords who master the Stratagem of the Shrewd Commander demonstrate superior focus and attention to detail on the battlefield. As they watch the combat unfold, they assess their enemies for weakness and exploit them through commands. Shrewd Commanders find gaps in their enemies' defenses and flaws in their tactics, using this knowledge to lead their allies to victory. ": "掌握 \"精明指挥官策略 \"的军阀在战场上表现出卓越的专注力和对细节的关注。当他们观察战斗的展开时，他们评估敌人的弱点，并通过命令来利用它们。精明的指挥官会发现敌人防御中的漏洞和战术中的缺陷，利用这些知识带领他们的盟友取得胜利。",
	"Their intimate understanding of the ebb and flow of combat, the tactics used by their enemies, and the resources the warlords have at their disposal enables them to react and adjust to almost any situation. ": "他们对战斗的起伏、敌人使用的战术以及军阀掌握的资源的密切了解，使他们能够对几乎任何情况作出反应和调整。",
	"You can quickly survey the battlefield and devise a plan of action to defeat your enemies. You can take a bonus action to issue battlefield commands to friendly creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you. You can issue a number of commands equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once). The commands remain for 10 minutes or until expended. Once you issue these commands, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.": "你可以迅速勘察战场，并制定一个行动计划来击败你的敌人。你可以采取一个额外的行动，向你周围30英尺内能听到你的友好生物发出战场指令。你可以发出与你的魅力修正值相等的命令（最少一次）。这些命令可以保持10分钟或直到耗尽。一旦你发出这些命令，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个短期或长期休息。",
	"Each command issued grants the creature a bonus die, which is a d4. When the creature would make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, the creature can expend the die by rolling it and adding the number rolled to the total. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Battle Command die, but must decide before the GM reveals whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once expended, the bonus die is lost.": "每一个命令的发出都会给予生物一个奖励模子，是一个D4。当生物要进行攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷时，生物可以通过掷骰子并将掷出的数字加入总数来消耗该骰子。生物可以等到它掷出d20后再决定使用战斗指令模子，但必须在GM揭示掷出的模子是成功还是失败之前决定。一旦耗尽，奖励模子就会丢失。",
	"When you reach certain levels in this class, the bonus die changes. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and a d12 at 17th level.": "当你在这个等级中达到一定的级别时，奖励模子会发生变化。在5级的时候，这个模子变成了d6，9级的时候变成了d8，13级的时候变成了d10，17级的时候变成了d12。",

If the target can hear you, it can take a reaction to make one weapon attack.": "你的盟友可以听从你的命令进行攻击。当你要在自己的回合中进行攻击时，你可以放弃进行攻击，让你身边10英尺内的友好生物代替你进行攻击。如果目标能听到你，它可以采取反应来进行一次武器攻击。",
	"The range of your presence increases to 30 feet at 10th level and increases again to 60 feet at 20th level.": "你的存在范围在10级时增加到30英尺，在20级时再次增加到60英尺。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you can deliver a stirring speech during a short rest to encourage your allies. You and any friendly creatures that can hear your speed gain temporary hit points. The amount of temporary hit points each creature gains is equal to the roll of the creature's Hit Die.": "从2级开始，你可以在短暂的休息中发表一段激动人心的演讲来鼓励你的盟友。你和任何能听到你的速度的友好生物都会获得临时的打击点数。每个生物获得的临时命中率等于该生物的命中率卷。",
