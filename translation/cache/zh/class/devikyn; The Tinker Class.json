	"A human in painted leathers lays in wait, peering through a makeshift scope. It is a magical glass that hovers just above her weapon, providing her enhanced sight. Her crossbow, modified with a large, glowing barrel, creaks as she pulls the trigger. With a crack, a wave of thunderous energy slams into an owlbear that plagued her home.": "一个穿着油漆皮衣的人在等待，通过一个临时的瞄准镜进行观察。这是一个神奇的玻璃，就在她的武器上方盘旋，为她提供增强的视觉。她的十字弓，改装了一个大的、发光的枪管，当她扣动扳机时发出吱吱声。随着一声脆响，一波雷鸣般的能量撞向困扰她家的猫头鹰。",
	"An elf, investigating a swamp near her home, brushes her hand over her face. Her skin, laced with veins of arcane magic, glows and forms a mask over her mouth. She wades into the swamp, investigating its depths. When she discovers an undead alligator, she emerges from the muck with a boom, propelled into the air by magic, and fires a large, heavy pellet from a modified crossbow.": "一个精灵在调查她家附近的沼泽地时，用手拂过她的脸。她的皮肤上布满了奥秘魔法的血管，发出光芒，在她的嘴上形成了一个面具。她涉足沼泽，调查其深处。当她发现一只不死的鳄鱼时，她从淤泥中走出来，发出轰隆隆的声音，被魔法推到空中，并从一个改良的十字弓中发射出一个巨大而沉重的弹丸。",
	"A dwarf searches his satchel for components, with a brilliant concoction in mind. He quickly rifles through the dozens of labeled ingredients, pulling two out and mixing them together in a vial. The liquid bubbles and shimmers, and he loads it into a small crossbow, clicking it into place in a small, customized cartridge. He fires it to test its capability, and grins when the vial explodes into a pool of acid, burning away at the stone he used as a test dummy.": "一个矮人在他的挎包里寻找成分，心里想着一个绝妙的调料。他迅速浏览了几十种贴有标签的成分，抽出两种，并将它们混合在一个小瓶中。液体冒着气泡，闪闪发光，他把它装进一个小弩，把它放在一个小的、定制的弹夹里。他发射了它以测试其能力，当小瓶爆炸成一滩酸液，烧掉他用作测试假人的石头时，他笑了。",
	"Between the many different walks of life, there are always tinkers — those crafty few who breathe new purpose into items that most would be satisfied to simply use. Tinkers, with their desire to study magic and infuse it into their work, commonly take great pride in upgrading items and inventing novel ways to use them. They see magic as a piece to an unfinished puzzle that they seek to complete; to do so needs experimentation and understanding. As such, tinkers can't resist the call of adventure, which allows them to make new and exciting discoveries that leave their particular signature on the world.": "在许多不同的行业之间，总是有修补匠--那些狡猾的少数人，他们为大多数人满足于简单使用的物品注入新目的。工匠们渴望研究魔法并将其注入他们的工作中，通常对升级物品和发明使用它们的新方法感到非常自豪。他们把魔法看作是他们试图完成的未完成的拼图的一部分；要做到这一点需要实验和理解。因此，工匠们无法抗拒冒险的召唤，这使他们能够做出新的和令人兴奋的发现，在世界上留下他们特殊的签名。",
	"Tinkers prefer to create tools for adventuring, rather than using their talents for trade. These crafty explorers will search out sources of magic in order to study it and learn how to incorporate new and exciting effects into their work. They revel in disassembling the workings of magic and manipulating its constituent components to their benefit.": "工匠们更喜欢为冒险创造工具，而不是将他们的才能用于贸易。这些狡猾的探险家会寻找魔法的来源，以研究它并学习如何将新的和令人兴奋的效果纳入他们的工作。他们乐于拆解魔法的工作原理，并操纵其组成成分，使其受益。",
	"Tinkers believe that there is more to magic than meets the eye. A tinker would jump at mere rumour of magical items, hoping to use their tools and insight to deciper its mysteries. Stories are often heard of the dancing light show that is a tinker combining a simple piece of rope with magical trinkets and essence, turning it into a snaking, quasi-sentient tool.": "修补匠相信，魔法比人们看到的更多。修补匠只要听到有关魔法物品的传闻就会跃跃欲试，希望用他们的工具和洞察力来解开它的奥秘。人们经常听到这样的故事：工匠将一根简单的绳子与神奇的饰品和精华结合起来，把它变成一个蜿蜒的、准智能的工具，这就是舞动的灯光秀。",
	"Tinkers, beyond all else, love to experiment. These crafty artisans will take any opportunity to try out a new modification, whether it is on weapons, armor, ammunition, or even other tools. A tinker will often be observed with a random item in their posession, using their tools to try and improve it in some way.": "工匠，超越一切，喜欢实验。这些狡猾的工匠会抓住任何机会尝试新的修改，无论是在武器、盔甲、弹药，甚至是其他工具上。一个工匠经常会被观察到他们手中的一个随机物品，使用他们的工具尝试以某种方式改进它。",
	"While their experiments sometimes have grand results, more often than not they produce something that is useless, wasting the original component. As such, perception of tinkers is generally negative - they are seen as wasteful, and are sometimes conceited because of their dedication to their craft. Tinkers know that their labors will bear fruit, and breaking a few eggs to do so is trivial to them.": "虽然他们的实验有时会有宏伟的结果，但更多的时候他们生产的东西是无用的，浪费了原来的部件。因此，人们对工匠的看法通常是负面的--他们被视为浪费，有时还因为他们对技艺的奉献而自负。工匠们知道他们的劳动会结出果实，为此打破几个鸡蛋对他们来说是微不足道的。",
	"As you make your tinker, think about how that character decided to tinker instead of taking up a more established artisanal craft. Did you find the everyday achievements of a normal artisan bland? Do you have a vision that current weapon styles do not suit? Were you commissioned by a powerful benefactor to improve their items in a way that their enemies would not expect? Are you, perhaps, madly obsessed with achieving perfection? Any of these options are valid reasons to become a tinker.": "当你制造你的工匠时，想一想这个人物是如何决定做工匠而不是从事更成熟的手工艺的。你是否觉得一个普通工匠的日常成就很平淡？你是否有当前武器风格不适合的愿景？你是否受一个强大的恩人委托，以一种敌人意想不到的方式改进他们的物品？你是否，也许，疯狂地迷恋于实现完美？这些选项中的任何一个都是成为工匠的有效理由。",
	"Perhaps you received an injury that prevents you from drawing a bow string, and you want revenge. Others still might have no combat training at all, but a natural knack for creativity and a talent with their tools, and so they use their abilities profitably by becoming an adventurer. While thinking about what makes you a tinker, also consider why you fight.": "也许你受了伤，无法拉开弓弦，而你想报仇。还有一些人可能根本没有接受过战斗训练，但却有天生的创造力和使用工具的天赋，因此他们通过成为冒险家来利用自己的能力来获得收益。在思考什么使你成为工匠的同时，还要考虑你为什么要战斗。",
	"You can make a tinker quickly using these choices. First, put your highest ability score in Dexterity, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the guild artisan background.": "你可以用这些选择来快速制造一个修补匠。首先，把你的最高能力得分放在灵巧上，其次是智力。第二，选择行会工匠背景。",
	"At 1st level, your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and repair them. You learn the {@spell mechanize|devikyn-tinker} and {@spell mending|phb} cantrips. When you cast {@spell mending|phb} on a {@filter construct|bestiary|type=construct} or an object, the target regains 4 hit points for each of your tinker levels. Additionally, you can cast the {@spell identify|phb} spell as a ritual, using your {@item tinker's tools|phb} in place of the material component for the spell.": "一级时，你对魔法物品的理解使你能够分析和修复它们。你学会了（%0%）和（%1%）的咒语。当你对一个{@spell mending|phb}或一个物体施放{@filter construct|bestiary|type=construct}时，目标会在你的工匠等级中每一级恢复4点命中。此外，你可以以仪式的方式施展（%%4%）法术，用你的（%%5%）来代替法术的材料成分。",
	"Also at 1st level, you can alter the firing mechanism of ranged weapons to allow rapid, but less forceful shooting.": "同样在1级时，你可以改变远程武器的发射机制，以允许快速但不太有力的射击。",
	"You spend 30 minutes, which can be during a short or long rest, using your {@item tinker's tools|phb} to reassemble an improved version of one {@filter ranged weapon you are holding that has the loading property|items|type=range|property=loading}. The weapon loses its {@i loading} property and gains the {@i bursting} property (see the {@book Weapon Properties|PHB|5|Weapon Properties|0} section).": "你花30分钟，可以在短期或长期休息时，用你的（%0%）来重新组装一个（%1%）的改进版。该武器失去了它的（%2%）属性，而获得了（%3%）属性（见（%4%）部分）。",
	"By 2nd level, you can store magic within non-magical items, infusing them with power to create new amalgamates.": "到了第二级，你可以在非魔法物品中储存魔法，为它们注入力量以创造新的混合体。",
	"Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with the magical properties of one of the magic items in the Amalgamate Items table below. You must choose a magic item appropriate for your tinker level, but the item can otherwise be of your choice. You can have a number of magic items from this feature equal to the Amalgamates column of the tinker table. If you create a new item while at this limit, you must replace one of your amalgamate magic items, which loses any properties it gained from this feature.": "每当你完成一个长时间的休息，你可以触摸一个非魔法物品，并将其赋予下面混合物品表中的一个魔法物品的魔法属性。你必须选择一个适合你工匠等级的魔法物品，但该物品可以由你选择。你可以从这个功能中拥有的魔法物品的数量等于工匠表的合并物品栏。如果你在这个极限时创造了一个新的物品，你必须替换掉你的一个汞齐化的魔法物品，这个物品会失去它从这个功能中获得的任何属性。",
	"You gain one item of your choice from the list of Available Items in the Amalgamate Items table for your tinker level when you gain this feature, as your labor researching and tinkering to perfect the amalgamation process bears fruit.": "当你获得这个特性时，你可以从你的工匠等级的可用物品列表中获得一件你选择的物品，因为你为完善合并过程而进行的研究和修补工作取得了成果。",
	"Also by 2nd level, as part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells. The spells tinkers typically learn are ones that allow them to change the form or function of other creatures and objects. See the {@book Player's Handbook chapter 10|PHB|10} for the general rules of spellcasting and Spells for the {@filter tinker spell list|spells|class=Tinker (TTC)}.": "同样在2级时，作为你学习魔法的一部分，你获得了施法的能力。工匠通常学习的法术是允许他们改变其他生物和物体的形式或功能。关于施法的一般规则，请参见（%0%）和（%1%）的法术。",
	"When you reach 2nd level, you learn two {@filter cantrips of your choice from the tinker spell list|spells|level=0|class=Tinker (TTC)}. You learn additional tinker cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tinker table.": "当你达到2级时，你学会了两个（%0%）。你在更高的等级学习额外的工匠咒语，如工匠表的已知咒语栏所示。",
	"The Tinker table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.": "工匠表显示了你有多少个法术槽来施展你的一级及以上的法术。要施展其中一个法术，你必须消耗一个该法术等级或更高的法术槽。当你完成长时间的休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。",
	"You prepare the list of tinker spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of tinker spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your tinker level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.": "你准备好可供你施展的工匠法术的清单。为此，选择与你的智力修正值+你的工匠等级的一半相等的工匠法术数量，向下取整（最少一个法术）。这些法术的等级必须是你有法术槽的。",
	"For example, if you're a 5th-level tinker, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell magic missile|phb}, you can cast it using a 1st level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一个五级工匠，你有四个一级和两个二级的法术槽。在智力为16的情况下，你准备的法术清单可以包括5个1级或2级的法术，以任何方式组合。如果你准备了1级法术（%0%），你可以用1级或2级法术槽来施放它。施放该法术并不会将其从你准备的法术列表中移除。",
	"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of tinker spells requires time spent in tinkering with your spellcasting foci: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.": "你可以在完成长时间休息时改变你准备的法术清单。准备一份新的修补法术清单需要花费时间修补你的法术施展焦点：对于你清单上的每个法术等级，至少需要1分钟。",
	"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your tinker spells, as your magic is powered by understanding the theory behind it. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tinker spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的工匠法术的施法能力，因为你的魔法是通过理解背后的理论来实现的。每当法术提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的智力。在设定你所施展的工匠法术的蓄力DC时，以及使用一个攻击卷时，你也会使用你的智力修饰。",
	"You may cast any tinker spell as a ritual if that spell has the {@filter ritual tag|spells|class=Tinker (TTC)|components & miscellaneous=ritual} and you have the spell prepared.": "你可以将任何工匠法术作为仪式来施放，如果该法术具有（%0%），并且你已经准备好该法术。",

	"At 3rd level, you begin to master a particular craft. Choose one of the following specializations: Artillerist, Augmenter, Chemist, Chronicle, Golemancer, Spellcrafter, or Wandslinger, detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization grants you additional features at 3rd, 5th, 14th, and 20th level.": "在3级时，你开始掌握一种特殊的手艺。从以下专业中选择一个。Artillerist, Augmenter, Chemist, Chronicle, Golemancer, Spellcrafter, or Wandslinger，详见等级描述的最后。你的专长在3、5、14和20级时赋予你额外的特性。",
	"Some of your specialization features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:": "你的一些特化功能需要你的目标做出一个蓄力动作来抵御效果。蓄力动作的计算方式如下。",

	"Your specialization grants you an additional feature at 5th level.": "你的专长在5级时授予你一个额外的特性。",
	"By 6th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.": "到了6级，你已经对魔法的运作有了足够的了解，即使物品不是为你准备的，你也能随机应变地使用它们。你无视所有等级、种族和级别对使用魔法物品的要求。",
	"Starting at 6th level, whenever you create a magic item with a rarity no greater than the rarity shown in the Magical Crafts Table for your tinker level, it takes a quarter of the time it would normally take, and it costs you half of the item's normal gold cost.": "从6级开始，每当你创造一个稀有度不高于你工匠等级的魔法工艺表中显示的稀有度的魔法物品时，它所花费的时间是正常情况下的四分之一，而它的成本是该物品正常黄金成本的一半。",
	"By 7th level, you gain the ability to channel your tinker spells into objects for later use.": "到了第七级，你获得了将你的工匠法术引导到物体中供以后使用的能力。",
	"When you cast a tinker spell with a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action while holding a nonmagical object, you can choose to expend the spell slot, but forego the spell's effects. Instead, you infuse the spell's magic inside the object. While a spell is infused into an object in this way, you can't regain the spell slot used to cast the spell by any means. The spell is infused until the object is used to cast it or until you use your action to dismiss it, and the object becomes magical while affected by this feature. Any creature holding the infused object can activate the stored spell as an action. The spell uses your spellcasting ability and originates from the object, but is otherwise treated as if the creature activating the object had cast it.": "当你在持有非魔法物品时施展施法时间为1个行动或1个额外行动的工匠法术时，你可以选择消耗法术槽，但放弃该法术的效果。相反，你将法术的魔力注入物体内。当咒语以这种方式被注入物体时，你不能以任何方式重新获得用于施法的咒语槽。咒语一直被注入，直到该物体被用来施放它，或者直到你使用你的行动来解除它，并且该物体在受此特性影响时变得有魔力。任何持有被注入的物体的生物都可以作为一个动作激活储存的法术。该咒语使用你的施法能力，并源自该物体，但在其他方面则被视为激活该物体的生物所施展的。",
	"Also at 7th level, you can put together a reasonable approximation of any craft through tinkering.": "同样在第7级，你可以通过修补术把任何工艺的合理近似物组装起来。",
