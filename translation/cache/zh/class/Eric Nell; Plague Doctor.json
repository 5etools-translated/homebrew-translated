	"Meandering through a blighted village, a halfling kneels beside the emaciated body of a human child. The child's lips are dry and cracked, her skin covered in blackened sores. The halfling waits patiently, peering through the lenses of his mask. There it is; a slight rising of the child's chest. She breathes still. Hurrying, the halfling opens his medicine bag and quickly mixes together a handful of herbs and curious liquids, tipping the small vial into the child's mouth. She may survive yet.": "在一个荒凉的村庄里徘徊，一个半身人跪在一个人类孩子憔悴的尸体旁。孩子的嘴唇干裂，皮肤上布满了发黑的溃疡。半身人耐心地等待着，透过面具的镜片观察着。就在那里；孩子的胸部微微隆起。她的呼吸静止了。半身人急忙打开他的药袋，迅速将一把草药和好奇的液体混合在一起，将小药瓶倒入孩子的嘴里。她可能还能活下来。",
	"Bearing her torch aloft, a human steps quietly through the catacombs that crawl beneath the city. She listens for a moment, and in the distance she makes out a soft sound; an anguished moaning, echoing along the walls of the crypt. Pulling her blade and whispering an incantation to protect against the abominations, she creeps forward, leaping at the last moment to remove the head of the creature that has been spreading disease and suffering throughout her city.": "一个人高举着火把，悄悄地穿过爬在城市下面的地下墓穴。她听了一会儿，在远处她听到了一种轻柔的声音；一种痛苦的呻吟声，在墓室的墙壁上回荡。她拔出刀子，低声念着咒语，以保护自己不受憎恶的影响，她匍匐前进，在最后一刻跃起，摘下那个在整个城市传播疾病和痛苦的生物的头。",
	"Crows wheel overhead as the half-elf picks their footing carefully through the battlefield. The fog of war has cleared, but a miasma still hangs over the area. They had watched the battle from the encampment, and now that it was over, they searched for survivors. As they inspected a body for any signs of life, an enemy combatant rises from the ground and lunges at the half-elf. They back peddle wildly, crying out a curse at their assailant. The warrior falls to the ground, choking on his own breath, before toppling over, blood and pus oozing from his lips, his body bloating with abnormal quickness.": "当半精灵在战场上小心翼翼地挑选自己的脚步时，乌鸦在头顶上飞翔。战争的迷雾已经散去，但该地区仍笼罩着一股瘴气。他们在营地里观看了这场战斗，现在战斗结束了，他们寻找幸存者。当他们检查一具尸体是否有生命迹象时，一个敌方战斗人员从地上爬起来，向半精灵扑来。他们疯狂地后退，对攻击者喊出了咒语。战士倒在地上，被自己的呼吸呛到，然后翻倒在地，血液和脓液从他的嘴唇中渗出，他的身体以不正常的速度胀大。",
	"Plague Doctors have a fascination, some would say morbid obsession, with biology, death, and disease. Spending many years devoted to the study of the body and the ailments that may afflict it, plague doctors are dedicated to the extermination of pestilence wherever it might try to reach. Some plague doctors spend their time researching and discovering various concoctions that might better prevent or combat plague as it spreads among the populace, while others hone their skills as cunning warriors, dedicating their lives to eradicating with sword and purifying fire any creature that brings illness upon the land. A few plague doctors have become so desensitized to the horrors they witness, or so filled with hatred for these diseases and those who spread them, that they use their vast knowledge to develop their own supernatural plagues to bring to bear against their foes.": "瘟疫医生对生物学、死亡和疾病有一种迷恋，有人会说是病态的迷恋。瘟疫医生多年来致力于研究身体和可能影响身体的疾病，他们致力于消灭任何可能试图到达的瘟疫。一些瘟疫医生花时间研究和发现各种可能更好地预防或对抗瘟疫在民众中传播的药方，而其他医生则作为狡猾的战士磨练自己的技能，献身于用剑和净化之火铲除任何给土地带来疾病的生物。一些瘟疫医生对他们目睹的恐怖变得如此麻木不仁，或者对这些疾病和传播这些疾病的人充满了仇恨，以至于他们利用自己丰富的知识来开发自己的超自然瘟疫，以对付他们的敌人。",
	"In combat, a plague doctor is a valuable ally. Using their tinctures and spells, they can be a boon to their comrades, and a curse to their enemies. A plague doctor approaches combat with a shrewd cunning, remaining beyond the reach of the fray as much as possible to better assist his allies, careful to allocate their assistance where it will be most effective, but close enough that they can rush in and stabilize a fallen friend, or strike down an enemy with violent precision.": "在战斗中，瘟疫医生是一个宝贵的盟友。使用他们的酊剂和法术，他们可以成为战友们的福音，也可以成为敌人的诅咒。瘟疫医生以精明狡猾的方式对待战斗，尽可能地保持在战场之外，以更好地帮助他的盟友，小心翼翼地将他们的援助分配到最有效的地方，但又足够近，他们可以冲进去，稳定一个倒下的朋友，或以暴力的方式精确打击一个敌人。",
	"A plague doctor rarely finds a warm welcome in the areas they visit. Though their work is invaluable, they are also viewed as an ill omen, for where a plague doctor goes, calamity has either struck, or is soon to follow. A few plague doctors have become so twisted by the horrors they see daily, that they become monsters in their own right, and work to undo the efforts of their less twisted brethren.": "瘟疫医生在他们访问的地区很少受到热烈欢迎。虽然他们的工作是无价的，但他们也被视为不祥之兆，因为瘟疫医生所到之处，灾难要么已经发生，要么即将发生。一些瘟疫医生被他们每天看到的恐怖所扭曲，以至于他们自己成为了怪物，并努力消除他们那些不那么扭曲的兄弟们的努力。",
	"Some more powerful plague doctors can learn to channel this fear and use it to drive away the enemies of the innocent, instilling terror in in the wicked and and profane. Theirs is a darker side to good works, and rare is the plague doctor who feels that, when it comes to their line of work, the ends don't justify the means.": "一些更强大的瘟疫医生可以学会引导这种恐惧，用它来驱赶无辜者的敌人，在邪恶和亵渎者中灌输恐怖。他们的善举有其黑暗的一面，很少有瘟疫医生认为，当涉及到他们的工作时，目的并不能证明手段是正确的。",
	"As you create your plague doctor, give some thought to why you pursued such grisly studies. What is it about death and disease that drew you to search it out, when so many others might run away? Did you lose friends and family to plague, and as the survivor, you've developed a burning desire to snuff it out? Perhaps you've always had a fascination with the forces of life and death, and the studies and travels of a plague doctor were a natural progression from childhood inquisitiveness? Are you a nihilist who understands that entropy is a part of the natural order, and you are only playing your own small role in the grander scheme of the multiverse that most people can't even fathom, let alone appreciate? Not all plague doctors work for the greater good, after all.": "当你创造你的瘟疫医生时，考虑一下你为什么要追求这种可怕的研究。是什么吸引了你去寻找死亡和疾病，而其他许多人可能会逃避？你是否在瘟疫中失去了朋友和家人，而作为幸存者，你已经产生了将其扼杀的强烈愿望？也许你对生命和死亡的力量一直很着迷，而瘟疫医生的研究和旅行是童年好奇心的自然发展？你是一个虚无主义者，明白熵是自然秩序的一部分，而你只是在大多数人甚至无法理解的多元宇宙的宏伟计划中扮演自己的小角色，更不用说欣赏？毕竟不是所有的瘟疫医生都为更大的利益工作。",
	"Consider your relationship to the populace. Most people fear the presence of a plague doctor, though your work is certainly important. How does your character handle being an object of fear, and in some cases, of loathing? Do you embrace and accept it, acknowledging it is a necessary sacrifice in a line of work that is desperately needed in many regions? Or do you resent the people you seek to aid, fighting off the urge to leave the ungrateful wretches to suffer? Or worse, do you cultivate that fear and your gruesome knowledge, turning it against the very people you first swore to help? The life of a plague doctor can certainly be lonely, and few can walk through so many horrors and tragedies and emerge unscathed.": "考虑你与民众的关系。大多数人害怕瘟疫医生的存在，尽管你的工作当然很重要。你的角色如何处理成为恐惧的对象，以及在某些情况下，厌恶的对象？你是否拥抱并接受它，承认它是许多地区迫切需要的工作中的必要牺牲？或者你憎恨你寻求帮助的人，抵制让那些不知感恩的可怜虫受苦的冲动？或者更糟糕的是，你是否培养这种恐惧和你可怕的知识，把它用来对付你最初发誓要帮助的人？瘟疫医生的生活肯定是孤独的，很少有人能经历如此多的恐怖和悲剧而毫发无伤。",
	"Plague Doctors spend years studying anatomy, medicine, and the various spells useful in their trade. These notes, lessons, and formulae are kept in a plague doctor's journal.": "瘟疫医生花数年时间研究解剖学、医学和在他们的行业中有用的各种法术。这些笔记、课程和公式都保存在瘟疫医生的日记中。",
	"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the plague doctor spell list. You learn additional plague doctor cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the plague doctor table.": "在1级的时候，你会从瘟疫医生的法术列表中选择三个咒语。在更高等级时，你会学习额外的瘟疫医生咒语，如瘟疫医生表的已知咒语栏所示。",
	"At 1st level, you have a journal containing six 1st-level plague doctor spells of your choice. Your journal is the repository of the plague doctor spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.": "在1级的时候，你有一本日记，里面有六个你选择的1级瘟疫医生法术。你的日记是你所知道的瘟疫医生法术的宝库，除了你的咒语，它们被固定在你的头脑中。",
	"The Plague Doctor class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of plague doctor spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of plague doctor spells from your journal equal to your Intelligence modifier + your plague doctor level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.": "瘟疫医生等级表显示了你有多少个法术槽来施展你的一级和更高等级的法术。要施展其中一个法术，你必须消耗一个该法术等级或更高的法术槽。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。你准备好可供你施展的瘟疫医生法术清单。为此，从你的日记中选择一定数量的瘟疫医生法术，其数量等于你的智力修正值+你的瘟疫医生等级（最少一个法术）。这些法术的等级必须是你有法术槽的。",
	"For example, if you're a 3rd-level plague doctor, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your journal. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一个三级的瘟疫医生，你有四个一级的和两个二级的法术槽。在智力值为16的情况下，你准备的法术清单可以包括六个一级或二级的法术，以任何组合形式，从你的日记中选择。如果你准备了1级法术 \"治愈伤口\"，你可以用1级或2级法术槽来施放它。施放该法术并不会将其从你的预备法术列表中移除。",
	"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of plague doctor spells requires time spent studying your journal and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.": "你可以在完成长时间休息后改变你准备的法术清单。准备一份新的瘟疫医生法术清单需要花时间研究你的日记，并记住你在施法时必须做出的咒语和手势：对于你清单上的每个法术等级，至少需要1分钟。",
	"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your plague doctor spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a plague doctor spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的瘟疫医生法术的施法能力，因为你通过专门的学习和记忆来学习你的法术。每当法术提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的智力。此外，在为你施展的瘟疫医生法术设定蓄力DC时，以及在用法术进行攻击卷时，你都会使用你的智力修饰。",
	"You can cast a plague doctor spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your journal. You don't need to have the spell prepared.": "你可以将瘟疫医生的咒语作为一种仪式来施放，如果该咒语有仪式标签，并且你的日记里有该咒语。你不需要准备好该咒语。",
	"You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your plague doctor spells.": "你可以使用一个奥术焦点作为你的瘟疫医生法术的施法焦点。",
	"Each time you gain a Plague Doctor level, you can add two plague doctor spells of your choice to your journal for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the plague doctor table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your journal (see \"Your Journal\").": "每当你获得一个瘟疫医生等级，你就可以在你的日记中免费添加两个你选择的瘟疫医生法术。每个法术的等级都必须是你有法术槽的，如瘟疫医生表所示。在你的冒险中，你可能会发现其他的法术，你可以添加到你的日记中（见 \"你的日记\"）。",
	"The spells that you add to your journal as you gain levels reflect the medical and esoteric research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of magic. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.": "随着你等级的提高，你添加到日记中的法术反映了你自己进行的医学和深奥的研究，以及你对魔法本质的智力突破。在你的冒险过程中，你可能会发现其他法术。例如，你可以在一个邪恶巫师的箱子里的卷轴上发现一个咒语，或者在一个古老的图书馆里的尘封的小册子里发现一个咒语。",
	"When you find a plague doctor spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your journal if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.": "当你发现一个1级或以上的瘟疫医生法术时，如果它的法术等级是你能准备的，并且你能抽出时间来破译和复制它，你可以把它加入你的日记。",
	"Copying that spell into your journal involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by whoever wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your journal using your own notation.": "将该咒语复制到你的日记中需要复制该咒语的基本形式，然后破译写该咒语的人所使用的独特符号系统。你必须练习该咒语，直到你理解所需的声音或手势，然后用你自己的符号将其抄写到你的日记中。",
	"For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.": "对于每一级的咒语，这个过程需要2小时，花费50戈比。这笔费用代表了你在试验该咒语以掌握它时所消耗的材料成分，以及你记录它所需的精细墨水。一旦你花费了这些时间和金钱，你就可以像其他法术一样准备这个法术。",
	"You can copy a spell from your own journal into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your journal. This is just like copying a new spell into your journal, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.": "你可以从自己的日记中复制一个咒语到另一本书中--例如，如果你想为你的日记做一个备份。这就像把一个新的咒语复制到你的日记本中一样，但是更快、更容易，因为你了解自己的记号，并且已经知道如何施法。你只需要花1个小时和10个金币就可以完成所复制的咒语的每一级。",
	"If you lose your journal, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new journal. Filling out the remainder of your journal requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many plague doctors keep backup journals in a safe place.": "如果你丢失了日记本，你可以用同样的程序将你准备的法术转录到新的日记本中。填写日记的剩余部分需要你找到新的法术来完成，和平常一样。出于这个原因，许多瘟疫医生将备份日记放在安全的地方。",
	"Your journal is a unique compilation of spells, notes, and formulae, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from a professor, an ream of loose papers kept in a simple case, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous journal in a mishap, wrapped with string.": "你的日记是一个独特的法术、笔记和公式的汇编，有自己的装饰和边注。它可能是一本普通的、实用的皮革书，是你从教授那里得到的礼物，也可能是一卷放在简单箱子里的散页，甚至可能是你在一次意外中丢失了以前的日记后，用绳子包起来的散页收集。",
	"Using a Healer's Kit, a Plague Doctor can double their proficiency bonus when using the Medicine skill to diagnose and treat a disease, as well as on any roll to stabilize a target. A Plague Doctor can also attempt to stabilize a target as a bonus action on their turn.": "使用治疗者套装，瘟疫医生在使用医学技能诊断和治疗疾病时，以及在任何稳定目标的卷轴上，可以获得双倍的熟练度奖励。瘟疫医生也可以在他们的回合中尝试稳定一个目标作为奖励动作。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you have learned to craft versatile potions called Tinctures. A Tincture is a rapidly brewed potion that is concocted by mixing together various herbs and other ingredients, called \"medicinals\", that the Plague Doctor collects throughout the course of their career. Depending on the medicinals selected during the brewing process, a Tincture can produce a wide array of effects, including minor healing, resistances, and other benefits.": "从2级开始，你已经学会了制作多功能的药水，叫做酊剂。酊剂是一种快速酿造的药水，它是由瘟疫医生在其职业生涯中收集的各种草药和其他成分（称为 \"药材\"）混合而成的。根据酿造过程中选择的药材，酊剂可以产生一系列广泛的效果，包括轻微的治疗、抵抗力和其他好处。",
	"You can brew a number of Tinctures per day equal to your Intelligence modifier plus one, with a minimum of one. When you do, you select two different effects from the list of medicinals you've discovered to creature the Tincture.": "你每天可以酿造的酊剂数量等于你的智力修正值加1，最少为1。当你这样做时，你可以从你发现的药材列表中选择两种不同的效果来创造酊剂。",
	"Tinctures are normally brewed when you finish a long rest, taking ten minutes to brew each one, but you can brew these Tinctures later in the day if you wish. Once imbibed, the effect of the Tincture lasts for one minute. In the case of medicinals that grant advantage or a bonus on dice rolls, the benefit must be used within the minute duration or it is lost. As Tinctures are prepared quicker and with less precision than true magic potions, Tinctures you brew lose their efficacy after a day.": "酊剂通常是在你完成长时间的休息时冲泡的，每次冲泡需要10分钟，但如果你愿意，可以在一天中的晚些时候冲泡这些酊剂。一旦喝下，酊剂的效果会持续一分钟。如果药水能提供优势或掷骰子的奖励，则必须在一分钟的时间内使用，否则就会失去好处。由于酊剂的制备比真正的魔法药水更快、更不精确，你酿造的酊剂在一天后就会失去效力。",
	"When you gain this class feature, you may select four medicinals from the list below for use in preparing your Tinctures. You learn one additional medicinal of your choice at 7th, 13th, and 18th levels.": "当你获得这个等级特征时，你可以从下面的列表中选择四种药材来准备你的酊剂。在第7、13和18级时，你可以额外学习一种你选择的药材。",

	"Plague doctor's are seen as portents of calamity, as they are usually encountered when plague has already stricken a settlement or region. Though their work is invaluable, plague doctors are viewed with as much fear and trepidation as they are respect. As such, experienced plague doctors are trained to amplify that association with fear, the better to drive off those who would intentionally spread the taint of disease throughout the world.": "瘟疫医生被视为灾难的预兆，因为他们通常是在瘟疫已经侵袭一个定居点或地区时遇到的。尽管他们的工作非常宝贵，但人们对瘟疫医生的看法是恐惧和害怕，就像对他们的尊重一样。因此，有经验的鼠疫医生被训练来放大这种恐惧的联想，以便更好地赶走那些故意在全世界传播疾病污点的人。",
	"At 5th level, you gain the ability to create an aura of fear as an action. The aura lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the plague doctor's level. When active, any creature that starts its turn within 10ft you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the your Grim Spectre for 24 hours. The difficulty of the saving throw equals the your spell save DC.": "在5级的时候，你获得了创造恐惧光环的能力，作为一个动作。该光环每天持续的回合数与瘟疫医生的等级相等。活动时，任何在你10英尺范围内开始行动的生物必须做一个智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物会受到惊吓，直到其下一回合开始。如果生物的救赎成功，该生物将在24小时内对你的狰狞幽灵免疫。蓄力的难度等于你的法术蓄力DC。",

	"An archaic form of treatment, bloodletting is still popular in areas where the populace is either poorly educated or lacking in divine healers.
