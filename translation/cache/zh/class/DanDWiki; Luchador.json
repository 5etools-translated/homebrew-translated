	"To multiclass into a Luchador, you also need the {@feat Grappler} feat.": "要多类成为一个Luchador，你还需要{@feat Grappler}的特技。",
	"Honor, family, tradition. This is the way of the luchador. To them, the world is just another ring to proclaim triumph over. From the righteous hero whose mere presence instills a wave of jubilation and confidence, to the darker path or rudos of the Lucha world who wish to prove they are the best by any means necessary. No matter the path taken, one thing remains paramount to the luchador: a good fight and becoming El Rey del Ring (The King of the Ring).": "荣誉、家庭、传统。这就是斗牛士的方式。对他们来说，世界只是另一个可以宣布胜利的擂台。从正义的英雄，他的存在就能灌输一波欢呼和信心，到黑暗的道路或鲁道夫，他们希望通过任何必要的手段证明他们是最好的。无论走哪条路，有一件事对Luchador来说仍然是最重要的：一场精彩的比赛和成为El Rey del Ring（拳击场之王）。",
	"Universal, it is a way of life and as such, any and all means of beings have been luchadors. While it is rare for more aquatic races such as Merfolk to become one, it isn't unheard of. Though normally coming from a family line of Lucha and simply continuing their family's tradition, there have been times when youth dazzled by the spectacle forwent their normal life to join the life of Lucha or even people seeing a vision adapting to the line as well. ": "通用的，它是一种生活方式，因此，任何和所有的生命手段都是luchadors。虽然像人鱼族这样的水生种族很少成为路查，但也并非闻所未闻。虽然通常是来自卢卡家族的血统，只是继承了他们家族的传统，但也有一些时候，被这种景象所吸引的年轻人放弃了他们的正常生活，加入了卢卡的生活，甚至有人看到了一种愿景，也适应了这种生活。",
	"Luchadors can fall into all spectrums of alignment as well as parties. Good luchadors or técnicos are adept at dealing with anyone, though their constant gains for attention and battle cries of honor have been know to grate on the nerves of party members. However, when the chips are done and lives are on the line, whether it be his best friend or his hated acquaintance, these Luchadors will be the first to fly into the fray and protect them. To técnicos, the party is their family and nothing comes before that. On the opposite side, we have the bad luchadors or rudos. To them, everyone is a challenge waiting to be toppled and they tend to ally with people either to boast about their strength or use as stepping stones to find the next great challenger. While not outright malicious to the point of evil, they won't hesitate to forgo allies in the sake of proving themselves the best and make it one step closer to El Rey del Ring.": "斗士可以分为各种不同的阵营，也可以分为不同的党派。好的Luchadors或Técnicos善于与任何人打交道，尽管他们不断地获得关注和对荣誉的战斗呐喊已经知道对党派成员的神经有影响。然而，当筹码用完，生命危在旦夕时，无论是他最好的朋友还是他讨厌的熟人，这些Luchadors将是第一个飞入战场并保护他们。对Técnicos来说，党就是他们的家庭，没有什么比这更重要。在相反的一边，我们有坏的Luchadors或rudos。对他们来说，每个人都是等待被推翻的挑战，他们倾向于与人结盟，要么夸耀自己的实力，要么作为垫脚石来寻找下一个伟大的挑战者。虽然没有直接恶意到邪恶的地步，但他们会毫不犹豫地放弃盟友，以证明自己是最好的，并使其离El Rey del Ring更近一步。",
	"While all alignments are allowed for luchadors, all, no matter how good or bad, must follow the code of luchadores. The rules follow as such:": "虽然所有的联盟都是允许的，但所有的人，不管是好的还是坏的，都必须遵循luchadores的守则。规则是这样的。",
	"If any of these tenets are broken, the luchador becomes an ex-luchador until they can recover their honor by whatever means that their own personal honor deems necessary; check with your DM for what this would fall under.": "如果这些信条中的任何一条被打破，该斗牛士就会成为前斗牛士，直到他们能够通过他们自己的个人荣誉认为必要的方式恢复他们的荣誉；请与你的DM检查这将属于什么情况。",
	"On the off chance a Luchadore is ever stripped of their mask, whether it be by a challenger or even his allies, they immediately become an ex-luchadore. You lose access to all Luchador moves and abilities aside from their Luchador unarmored movement, unarmored defense, Improved Combat Grappler and Unarmed Savant and become a Monk of equal level without access to a Monastic Tradition, access to Ki, or monk exclusive abilities.": "如果一个Luchadore被剥夺了他们的面具，不管是被挑战者还是他的盟友，他们会立即成为一个前Luchadore。你将失去所有鲁查多的动作和能力，除了鲁查多的无装甲移动、无装甲防御、改进的战斗擒拿手和徒手高手，并成为同等水平的僧侣，没有机会获得僧侣传统，没有机会获得基，也没有僧侣专属的能力。",
	"Your save DC for your abilities is calculated as follows. This does not apply if an ability states a different save DC.": "你的能力的保存DC是按以下方式计算的。如果某项能力规定了不同的救赎DC，这并不适用。",
	"To a Luchador, the mask isn't just a symbol, it is an embodiment of their form and as much a part of them as their soul. As such, when wearing your mask, your senses are sharpened to the extreme to protect it. You have advantage on {@skill Perception} checks, plus your Luchador level, to discover threats to your mask. This bonus does not apply to your Passive {@skill Perception} to notice threats against allies, or yourself, but only attempts to harm and/or steal your mask.": "对Luchador来说，面具不仅仅是一个符号，它是他们形态的体现，和他们的灵魂一样是他们的一部分。因此，当你戴上面具时，你的感官会变得异常敏锐以保护它。在发现对你的面具的威胁时，你在{@skill Perception}检查上有优势，加上你的Luchador等级，。这个奖励不适用于你的被动技能（1%），即发现对盟友或你自己的威胁，但只适用于试图伤害和/或偷窃你的面具。",
	"A Luchador is a master of quick and powerful unarmed strikes. Your unarmed attacks deal {@dice 1d4} damage + Strength or Dexterity Modifier, this damage increases to {@dice 1d6} at 6th level, {@dice 1d8} at 11th level and {@dice 1d10} at 17th level.": "斗士是一个快速而有力的徒手攻击的大师。你的徒手攻击造成{@dice 1d4}的伤害+力量或灵巧修正值，这个伤害在6级时增加到{@dice 1d6}，11级时增加到{@dice 1d8}，17级时增加到{@dice 1d10}。",
	"To a Luchador, honor and the cheers of the crowd are their strength just as much as their stamina and quick reflexes, and as such, their charisma is factored into their AC. While not wearing either armor or a shield, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your Charisma modifier.": "对于一个斗牛士来说，荣誉和观众的欢呼是他们的力量，就像他们的耐力和快速反应一样，因此，他们的魅力也被计入他们的攻击力。在没有穿戴盔甲或盾牌的情况下，你的护甲等级等于10+你的力量或灵巧修正值（你选择）+你的魅力修正值。",
	"Years of training have taught you that no matter the size, weight, or ability, the spirit of Lucha is mighty and allows for feats of near superhuman strength and dexterity.": "多年的训练使你了解到，无论体型、体重或能力如何，卢卡精神都是强大的，可以实现近乎超人的力量和灵巧的壮举。",
	"After a successful {@action Grapple|phb|grapple}, you may attempt to pin your opponent as your bonus action to apply the {@condition restrained} effect on them, this is determined by another {@action Grapple|phb|grapple} check. When pinning an opponent, you are considered {@condition grappled} with the opponent, but not {@condition restrained}. This does not apply if you are {@condition restrained} yourself.": "在成功的{@action Grapple|phb|grapple}之后，你可以尝试将对手作为你的额外行动，对其施加{@condition restrained}的效果，这是由另一个{@action Grapple|phb|grapple}检查决定的。当夹住对手时，你被认为是与对手一起的（%3%），但不是（%4%）。如果你自己是{@condition restrained}的话，这并不适用。",
	"You may use your bonus action to instead make an unarmed strike against your opponent that is {@condition grappled}, pinned, or {@condition restrained} by you.": "你可以使用你的额外行动来代替对你的对手进行一次非武装攻击，该对手被你压制了（%0%），或（%1%）。",
	"You may use either your Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}), or Strength ({@skill Athletics}), when making a {@action Grapple|phb|grapple} check.": "在进行{@action Grapple|phb|grapple}检查时，你可以使用你的灵巧({@skill Acrobatics})，或力量({@skill Athletics})。",
	"For all creatures one size larger than you, or smaller, weight and size has no affect when attempting a finishing move, grapple, or pin.": "对于所有比你大一号或小一号的生物，在尝试终结动作、擒拿或夹击时，体重和体型都没有影响。",
	"(If allowed by your DM, feel free to ask if you may also begin with the {@feat Grappler} feat.)": "(如果你的管理员允许，你可以询问你是否也可以从{@feat Grappler}的壮举开始。）",
	"At 2nd Level, the Luchador is now able to combo their offence into a powerful finishing move. As an attack action, you may attempt a finishing move on an enemy that is {@condition grappled}, pinned, {@condition restrained} or has 0 movement speed to deal {@dice 1d8} damage + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. You can use a finishing move once per turn, with a number of uses equal to half your Luchador level, rounded down.": "在2级时，Luchador现在能够将他们的进攻组合成一个强大的终结动作。作为一个攻击动作，你可以对一个处于{@condition grappled}、被钉住、{@condition restrained}或移动速度为0的敌人尝试一个终结动作，造成{@dice 1d8}伤害+你的力量或灵巧修饰。你每回合可以使用一次终结技，使用次数等于你的Luchador等级的一半，向下取整。",
	"As you gain levels in this class, Finishing Move die increases according to Finishing Move Die column of the Luchador class table. You regain uses of this feature after a short or long rest.": "当你在这个等级中获得的等级，终结动作模子会根据Luchador等级表的终结动作模子一栏而增加。在短期或长期休息后，你会重新获得该功能的使用权。",
	"At level 8 this damage is considered magical for the purposes of bypassing resistances.": "在第8级时，这种伤害被认为是为了绕过抵抗力而产生的魔法。",
	"In the heat of battle, a Luchador can channel inspiration, whether from past victories, or bond with their mask and allies, to perform uncanny feats of technique and strength. At 2nd level, you may add an Inspiration die of {@dice 1d4} to an initial grapple attempt and as damage to a following successful pin, once per turn. One inspiration die use affects both your grapple and pin, only if they are made on the same turn. The die becomes a {@dice d6} at 13th level, {@dice d8} at 17th level. You have a number of Inspiration dice, equal to your Charisma modifier, to a minimum of 1. You regain uses after a long rest.": "在激烈的战斗中，Luchador可以引导灵感，无论是从过去的胜利，还是与他们的面具和盟友的联系，来完成技术和力量的不可思议的壮举。在2级时，你可以在最初的抓捕尝试中加入一个灵感模子（%0%），并在接下来的成功夹击中作为伤害，每回合一次。一个灵感模子的使用同时影响你的抓捕和夹击，只有当它们是在同一回合进行的。在13级的时候，这个骰子会变成{@dice d6}，在17级的时候变成{@dice d8}。你拥有的灵感骰子数量等于你的魅力修正值，最小为1。 你在长时间休息后会恢复使用。",
	"At 3rd level, the Luchador chooses to follow a path of Lucha. They may become a Técnico, Rudo or Espíritu. Técnicos rely less on tricks and deception and draw their strength from the bonds shared between their allies, and high flying acrobatic moves, to prevail in combat. Rudos use cunning and underhanded tactics, believing anything goes, when in the ring and will use any means to claim victory. While all Luchador are attuned with their ancestors and the creatures of their mask, the Espíritu takes it to another level. Through work and mediation, they have gained the ability to channel the spirit within their mask as well as their very ancestors to aid them in battle.": "在3级时，斗士选择走一条斗士的道路。他们可以成为Técnico、Rudo或Espíritu。Técnicos较少依赖技巧和欺骗，他们的力量来自于盟友之间的联系，以及高空杂技动作，从而在战斗中获胜。鲁道夫使用狡猾和暗中的战术，认为在擂台上什么都可以做，并会使用任何手段来获得胜利。虽然所有的鲁道夫都与他们的祖先和他们面具上的生物相适应，但埃斯皮里图将其提升到另一个层次。通过工作和调解，他们已经获得了引导面具中的精神以及他们的祖先在战斗中帮助他们的能力。",
	"Beginning from 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can bellow a challenge to an enemy that can see and/or hear you, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the enemy is only able to target you with attack rolls, spells, or skill challenges for 1 minute. All attacks made on targets that are not you are made at disadvantage, this disadvantage doesn't apply if the spell naturally can hit multiple targets. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. You regain use of this feature on short or long rest.": "从第三级开始，作为一个额外的动作，你可以向一个能看到和/或听到你的敌人发出挑战，迫使他们做出智慧救赎的动作。拯救失败后，敌人只能在1分钟内用攻击卷、法术或技能挑战来攻击你。所有对非你的目标进行的攻击都是在劣势下进行的，如果法术自然可以击中多个目标，这个劣势就不适用。他们可以在每个回合结束时重复这个蓄力动作。你在短时或长时休息时重新使用这一特性。",

	"At 5th level, the Luchador can attack twice, instead of once, whenever they take the {@action Attack} action on their turn. You may make two {@action Grapple|phb|grapple} attempts instead as well. The Luchador can now grapple two creatures within their reach at once, that are one size larger than them, or smaller albeit at the cost of any extra attacks as well as their bonus action.": "在5级时，Luchador可以在他们的回合中采取{@action Attack}行动时，攻击两次，而不是一次。你也可以进行两次（%1%）的尝试。斗士现在可以一次抓取两个在他们范围内的生物，这些生物比他们大一个尺寸，或者更小，尽管要付出任何额外的攻击以及他们的奖励行动。",
	"In a constant race to get up close and personal with their opponent, Luchadors in combat are able to move more swiftly then their allies to get right into the action.

This bonus increases when you reach certain Luchador levels, as shown in the Luchador table.": "在不断地与对手近距离接触的过程中，战斗中的Luchadors能够比他们的盟友更迅速地移动，直接进入战斗。从第五级开始，当你没有穿戴盔甲或挥舞盾牌时，你的速度会增加5英尺。当你达到一定的斗士等级时，这个奖励会增加，如斗士表所示。",
	"At 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Way of Lucha.": "在6级时，你获得一个由你的鲁奇之道赋予的功能。",
	"The Luchador has trained their strikes to harm even the sturdiest of opponents. At 6th level, Unarmed Strikes count as magical, for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.": "斗士已经训练了他们的攻击，甚至可以伤害最坚固的对手。在6级的时候，徒手击打算作是魔法的，目的是为了克服对非魔法攻击和伤害的抵抗和免疫力。",
	"At 7th level, the Luchador has become hardened mentally. Whether it be a creature or magic, the Luchador no longer steps down from any challenge and sees every opponent as another way to achieve the title of El Rey del Ring. You gain advantage against all effects that incur the {@condition frightened} condition.": "在第七级时，Luchador在精神上已经变得很强硬。无论是生物还是魔法，Luchador不再从任何挑战中退缩，而是将每个对手都视为获得El Rey del Ring称号的另一种方式。你对所有产生{@condition frightened}条件的效果都获得优势。",

	"If a Técnicos, you understand the bonds of friendship and family more than any other and as such will fight even harder to protect them. When an ally within five feet of you is melee attacked by an opponent, and you have at least one hand or both legs free, you may attempt to stop the attack by grappling and pinning the enemy as your reaction. If you fail the check, you take all the damage your ally would've taken. This grapple or pin automatically ends at the start of your next turn.": "如果是Técnicos，你比其他任何人都更了解友谊和家庭的纽带，因此会更加努力地去保护他们。当你身边五英尺内的盟友受到对手的近战攻击，而你至少有一只手或两条腿是自由的，你可以尝试通过抓捕和钉住敌人作为你的反应来阻止攻击。如果你检查失败，你将承受你的盟友可能遭受的所有伤害。这一抓捕或夹击在你下一回合开始时自动结束。",
	"If a Rudo, your allies may be expendable in the long run, but in the here and now, they are necessary. When an ally within five feet of you is melee attacked by an opponent within five feet, you may attempt to blindside your enemy by attempting one unarmed attack against them, as your reaction.": "如果你是鲁道夫，你的盟友从长远来看可能是可有可无的，但在此时此刻，他们是必要的。当你五英尺内的盟友被五英尺内的对手近身攻击时，你可以尝试对敌人进行一次徒手攻击，以此作为你的反应，使敌人失明。",
	"If an Espíritu, you have seen spirits and know their sufferings, especially those who refuse to see their loved ones enter the afterlife prematurely.

It also prevents creatures from using natural abilities, such as the teleportation of a {@creature blink dog} or {@creature balor}. A grapple attempt is made with disadvantage, if the creature is already ethereal, or astral, and does not prevent extra-dimensional perception, or attack. This ability does not stop summoned creatures from vanishing when the spell that summoned them ends. ": "在10级的时候，无论是通过异象，还是精神之旅，Luchador都被他的祖先赋予了力量，让他们能够身体力行地对抗所有的生命。斗士有能力通过魔法手段触摸和抓取所有无法触摸的生物。你抓捕的生物必须做一个法术能力检查，其熟练度由Luchador的力量（（%0%））或灵巧（（%1%））检查来决定，以便使用一个法术或效果，例如（%2%）、（%3%）、（%4%）、Drawmij的瞬间退出（q。 v.）、{@spell etherealness}、{@spell gate}、{@spell maze}、{@spell misty step}、{@spell plane shift}或{@spell teleport}，以逃脱抓捕。它也阻止生物使用自然能力，例如（%11%）或（%12%）的传送。如果生物已经是虚无缥缈的，或者是星际的，那么抓捕的尝试是以劣势进行的，并不妨碍超维度的感知，或攻击。这个能力并不能阻止被召唤的生物在召唤它们的法术结束时消失。",

	"At 20th level, the Luchador has attained the title of El Rey del Ring, but, it isn't enough anymore. The beings of the natural material plane can no longer sate the thirst for battle within the Luchador, they need more to prove that the way of the Lucha is truly the way. The Luchador's body no longer ages, nor do they need to sleep, eat, or drink staying at its prime at all times in attempt to find stronger opponents to fight. A short rest is all that is needed to gain back all Luchador abilities and die, even abilities that normally require long rest. Their mask becomes one with the Luchador, no longer being able to be removed. At this point, the Luchador can grapple any and all creatures of any size, or form, with advantage.

	"The people's hero. These are the Luchadors that strive to not just better themselves for themselves but strive to show the people that anything can be achieved, through hard work and determination. While they might boast and fight, they remember their roots and work to raise confidence in all folk. At times, they become folk heroes, riding into towns and using their prowess to overtake corruption through Lucha, then leaving before they can be rewarded, all in the sake of justice. Técnicos fight for El Rey del Ring but use clean high flying spectacle moves and provoke their allies to success through their own personal strength.": "人民的英雄。这些是努力不只是为了自己更好，而是努力向人们展示，通过努力工作和决心，任何事情都可以实现的Luchadors。虽然他们可能会吹嘘和战斗，但他们不忘初心，努力提高所有民众的信心。有时，他们会成为民间英雄，骑马进入城镇，用他们的能力通过Lucha克服腐败，然后在他们得到奖励之前离开，这一切都是为了正义。Técnicos为El Rey del Ring而战，但使用干净的高空飞行奇观动作，并通过自己的个人力量激起盟友的成功。",
	"At 3rd level, a Técnicos style of wrestler prides themselves in their speed and agility, and heavily prefer the air over the ground. The Técnicos' prowess in such aerial fields allows them to instead use their Dexterity modifier instead of Strength when jumping and making jump attempts. While unarmored, you have the ability to become airborne after performing a long jump or high jump, except you only have to move at least 5 feet before making the jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 5 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier if you move at least 5 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump the full distance. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength or Dexterity score if you move at least 5 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap the full distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. This can only be done if you are wearing no armor.
