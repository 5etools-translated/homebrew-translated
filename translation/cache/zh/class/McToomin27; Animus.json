	"An unassuming mouse skitters down a castle corridor. It seems to have a clear destination in mind: the castle's forbidden library. The guards pay it no mind as it scampers past. It squeezes underneath the door to the library. The lights are out; the library empty. The mouse begins to grow, its features shifting. Quickly, it takes the form of a curious halfling. The halfling smiles, looking around at their treasure. The halfling chooses a tome on extinct creatures, and begins to read...": "一只不起眼的老鼠在城堡的走廊上溜达。它似乎有一个明确的目的地：城堡里的禁地图书馆。当它溜达过去时，守卫们对它毫不在意。它从图书馆的门缝里挤了进去。灯光熄灭了；图书馆里空无一人。老鼠开始成长，它的特征发生了变化。很快，它变成了一个好奇的半身人的形状。半身人微笑着，环视着他们的宝藏。半身人选择了一本关于灭绝生物的书，并开始阅读......",
	"An older elf sits on a log, unperturbed by the family of apes cavorting around them. The elf smiles wistfully, experiencing behavior and interactions that have never been documented before. They make sketches of the apes, noting their personalities, their likes and dislikes. Suddenly, one of the largest apes decides he doesn't like the elf's presence.

	"A group of thugs are terrorizing a village. The village has no one to stand up to these villains. That is, until a young half-orc steps forward. The half-orc tells them to leave the village, and never return. The thugs look at one another, and then begin to laugh. In their revelry, they don't notice that the half-orc's skin has begun to turn into scales. Sharp teeth emerge from their gums; their head and jaws begin to grow.

They hesitate briefly before screaming and running from the apparition, never to return...": "一群暴徒正在恐吓一个村庄。村子里没有人站出来对付这些恶棍。也就是说，直到一个年轻的半兽人站了出来。半兽人告诉他们离开这个村子，永远不要回来。暴徒们彼此对视，然后开始大笑。在他们的狂欢中，他们没有注意到半兽人的皮肤已经开始变成了鳞片。锋利的牙齿从他们的牙床里冒出来；他们的头和下巴开始生长。不出片刻，一个已经灭绝的兽王就站在了这些闯入者面前。他们短暂地犹豫了一下，然后尖叫着从这个幽灵身边跑开，再也没有回来......",
