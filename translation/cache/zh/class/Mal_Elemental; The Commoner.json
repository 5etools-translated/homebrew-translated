	"There are not prerequisites for multiclassing into the commoner class - it's a class open to everyone!": "多重分类进入平民阶层没有先决条件--这是一个向所有人开放的阶层！在这个阶层中，有很多人都有机会进入。",
	"A rugged farmer toils the land, wiping the sweat of his brow as harvests his fields–he works from dawn to dusk, a basket of corn over his back. A hardy peddler travels the road, selling pots and pans through small village for pittance. An overworked clerk sits over a desk, chewing the end of her quill as she feverishly works through a pile of letters.": "一个粗犷的农民在土地上劳作，收割田地时擦拭额头的汗水--他从黎明到黄昏，背上背着一筐玉米。一个勤劳的小贩在路上行走，在小村庄里以微薄的价格出售锅碗瓢盆。一个劳累过度的文员坐在办公桌前，一边嚼着羽毛笔的末端，一边疯狂地处理着一堆信件。",
	"It ain't much, but it's honest work. Commoners have never had any sort of special learning, but they make do through grit, long hours and hard work. They've earned what little they have. They work hard, they do their jobs–no one ever taught them how to swing a battleaxe or throw magic bolts around.": "这不算什么，但这是诚实的工作。平民从来没有受过任何特殊的学习，但他们通过勇气、长时间和艰苦的工作来完成。他们赢得了他们所拥有的一点东西。他们努力工作，做他们的工作--没有人教过他们如何挥舞战斧或到处扔魔法弹。",
	"But even so, even commoners sometimes have adventures of their own. Because why should those arrogant knights and snotty wizards get to hog the limelight all the time?": "但即便如此，即使是平民有时也会有自己的冒险。因为为什么那些傲慢的骑士和流着鼻涕的巫师要一直抢占风头？",
	"Commoners know to stick together. They don't possess any remarkable skills, but they help out where possible. When a regular person goes up against a rampaging dragon, or faces a savage goblin horde, they learn one lesson above all others; stay with the group or you're dead.": "普通人知道要团结起来。他们不具备任何杰出的技能，但他们尽可能地帮助别人。当一个普通人面对一条横冲直撞的龙，或者面对一个野蛮的哥布林部落时，他们会学到一个最重要的教训；和大家在一起，否则你就死定了。",
	"In that theme, commoners support others rather than handling problems alone. They will stay behind the big barbarian when the fighting starts, and they'll let the mages handle the fireballs. Commoners form teams, and they confront problems with friends by their side.": "在这个主题中，平民支持他人而不是独自处理问题。当战斗开始时，他们会呆在大野蛮人的后面，他们会让法师处理火球。平民组成团队，他们在朋友的陪伴下面对问题。",
	"Commoners make for uncommon adventurers, but it's not unheard of for a farmer to leave his home and go adventuring, or for a clerk to pick up a sword instead of a quill. Think about what reason an average worker might have to go on an adventure; they may be seeking fortune and fame, or have been forced to by necessity, or maybe they are just tired of living a mundane life.": "普通人是不常见的冒险家，但一个农民离开家去冒险，或者一个文员拿起剑而不是羽毛笔，也不是没有过。想一想一个普通工人可能有什么理由去冒险；他们可能是为了寻求财富和名声，或者是迫于无奈，也可能只是厌倦了平凡的生活。",
	"Commoners are defined largely by their professions - their jobs that they work. Commoners can take on wildly different roles depending on their livelihoods. Four subclasses are provided–a hardy farmer, an enterprising merchant, an erudite clerk, or a self-reliant vagabond.": "平民在很大程度上是由他们的职业决定的--他们所从事的工作。平民可以根据他们的生计而扮演不同的角色。我们提供了四个亚类--坚韧的农民、进取的商人、博学的文员、或自力更生的流浪者。",
	"You can make a commoner quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score. Your second highest ability score depends on what subclass you choose; if playing a farmer choose Strength, if playing a merchant choose Charisma, if playing a clerk choose Intelligence, and if playing a vagabond choose Dexterity. Finally, pick whatever background appeals most to you.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名平民。首先，宪法应该是你的最高能力得分。你的第二高能力得分取决于你选择的子类；如果扮演农民，选择力量；如果扮演商人，选择魅力；如果扮演店员，选择智力；如果扮演流浪者，选择灵巧。最后，选择对你最有吸引力的背景。",
	"Commoners make for a strange class in that they are meant ot be unremarkable, and slightly less than average in everything. That doesn't mean they are {@i useless} (they do have a few unique skills), but commoner is a class intended to encourage more role-playing opportunities rather than direct combat capability.": "平民是一个奇怪的等级，因为他们注定是不引人注目的，而且在任何方面都比一般人略差。这并不意味着他们是{@i useless}（他们确实有一些独特的技能），但平民是一个旨在鼓励更多角色扮演机会而不是直接战斗能力的等级。",
	"For a more challenging experience, you can chose to lean into this playstyle by making yourself truly average, and set all of your ability scores equal to 10 or 12. Good luck!": "为了获得更具挑战性的体验，你可以选择向这种玩法靠拢，使自己成为真正的普通人，并将你所有的能力分数设置为10或12。祝您好运!",
	"From 1st level, you gain appreciation of the struggles of the common man. People look at you and they recognize you as a steady, down-to-earth person - they can tell by the dirt under your fingernails or the weary gaze in your eyes. This has the following effects, dependent on who you are interacting with:": "从第一层开始，你获得了对普通人挣扎的欣赏。人们看着你，他们认识到你是一个稳定的、脚踏实地的人--他们可以从你指甲里的泥土或你眼中疲惫的目光中看出。这有以下影响，取决于你与谁交往。",
	"You have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) rolls made when interacting with everyday workers. Common folk look out for each other; bartenders become more likely to share scandalous gossip with you, farmers are more likely to shelter you in their homes for a night, and common townsfolk are more likely to warn you when trouble is afoot.": "当你与普通工人交往时，你在魅力（（%0%））卷上有优势。普通人互相照顾；酒保更有可能与你分享丑闻八卦，农民更有可能在他们的家里为你遮风挡雨一晚，而普通镇民更有可能在麻烦出现时警告你。",
	"You have advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) rolls made towards any merchants or swindlers who may be trying to take advantage of your hard-earned money.": "对任何可能试图利用你的血汗钱的商人或骗子，你在智慧({@skill Insight})卷上有优势。",
	"You have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) rolls made when you are attempting to convince any sort of authority that you didn't do something. Arrogant nobility is biased to assume that all common people are lazy and unremarkable, and they will naturally disbelieve you if you claim any great accomplishment.": "当你试图说服任何形式的权威，让他们相信你没有做过什么事时，你在魅力（（%0%））卷上有优势。傲慢的贵族会偏向于认为所有的普通人都是懒惰的、不引人注目的，如果你声称有什么伟大的成就，他们自然会不相信你。",
	"In addition, you understand 'trader talk'–a heavy mix of dialect and jargon that is popular among tradesmen and travelers. Trader talk sounds very rough and uses a great deal of obscure slang (often referring to mundane objects through weird names) which allows traders to recognize and communicate exclusively between themselves. It varies greatly depending on location and dialect, but commoners know how to translate heavily-accented voices and you can decipher any profession-specific slang.": "此外，你还能听懂 \"商人话\"--一种在商人和旅行者中流行的方言和行话的严重混合。贸易商的谈话听起来非常粗糙，并使用了大量晦涩难懂的俚语（经常通过怪异的名字来指代平凡的物品），这使得贸易商能够识别并在他们之间进行专门交流。它因地点和方言的不同而差异很大，但平民知道如何翻译口音很重的声音，你可以破译任何特定职业的俚语。",
	"Merchants will often treat anybody who understands trader talk differently; unscrupulous merchants that might otherwise attempt to take advantage will do not do so, while other tradesmen may even offer favors or advice.": "商人通常会以不同的方式对待任何听得懂商人话语的人；那些原本可能试图占便宜的无良商人不会这样做，而其他商人甚至可能提供优惠或建议。",
	"From 1st level, you are proficient with improvised weapons. Specifically, you can use your artisan's tools as makeshift melee weapons, and you add your expertise bonus when making attack rolls with them. They deal {@dice 1d4} of whatever damage type is appropriate for them.": "从1级开始，你可以熟练使用简易的武器。具体来说，你可以使用你的工匠工具作为临时的近战武器，在使用它们进行攻击时，你会加上你的专业技能奖励。它们会造成{@dice 1d4}适合它们的任何伤害类型。",
	"Commoners work many different jobs, and take different approaches to life. Your livelihood determines your job, your experiences, and forms a major part of your character.": "平民从事许多不同的工作，并采取不同的生活方式。你的生计决定了你的工作、你的经历，并构成你性格的主要部分。",
	"Your Livelihood grant additional class features at 1st, 5th, 9th and 14th level.": "你的生计在1、5、9和14级时授予额外的等级特征。",
	"Adventuring is dangerous work, but you manage to get by. Barely. From 2nd level, whenever an effect or attack would kill or reduce you to 0 hp, you fall prone and survive with 1 hp instead.": "冒险是危险的工作，但你设法得到了。勉强。从第二级开始，每当一个效果或攻击会杀死你或使你的生命值减少到0时，你就会倒下，以1的生命值生存。",
	"Afterwards, any hostile creatures in the area are faced with a Perception check with DC equal to 12 + your proficiency bonus, and on a failed check they will assume that you are dead and move onwards to another target. This effect lasts until you either move or make an action, at which point they will realize that you somehow survived.": "之后，该区域内的任何敌对生物都会面临一个感知检查，DC等于12+你的熟练度加成，如果检查失败，它们会认为你已经死了，并继续向另一个目标前进。这个效果一直持续到你移动或做出行动，这时他们会意识到你以某种方式活了下来。",
	"You regain use of this feature when you finish a long or short rest.": "当你完成长时间或短时间的休息时，你会重新使用这一功能。",
	"At 3rd level, you can use the {@action Help} action as a bonus action.": "三级时，你可以使用（%0%）的行动作为额外行动。",
	"When faced with an unfamiliar challenge, you roll your sleeves up and get it done. At 3rd level, you can spend ten minutes practicing using a set of tools and gain a temporary proficiency bonus. This temporary proficiency will last until your next long rest, it doesn't stack with any other, and you can only have one at a time.": "当面对一个陌生的挑战时，你会卷起袖子去完成它。在3级时，你可以花10分钟练习使用一套工具，并获得一个临时的熟练度奖励。这个临时熟练度将持续到你的下一次长休，它不与其他任何东西叠加，而且你一次只能拥有一个。",
	"This temporary proficiency bonus can be applied towards any tool, mount, or vehicle - so you long as you have an object in hand that you can use to practice. You cannot gain any skill proficiency in this manner.": "这个临时的熟练度奖励可以应用于任何工具、坐骑或车辆--所以只要你手中有一个可以用来练习的物体。你不能以这种方式获得任何技能的熟练度。",
	"During this practice period, you may fall several times - for example, if you are practicing at disabling a tripwire to gain proficiency in thieves' tools then you will likely trigger the trap, or if you practicing at mounting a horse then the horse may buckle. It is at the DM's discretion whether there will be any consequences from mistakes made during this practice period.": "在这个练习期间，你可能会摔倒几次--例如，如果你在练习解除绊马索以获得对盗贼工具的熟练程度，那么你很可能会触发陷阱，或者如果你在练习骑马，那么马可能会倒地。在这个练习期间，是否会有任何错误的后果，由管理员决定。",
	"At 6th level, this temporary proficiency bonus doubles.": "在6级时，这个临时的熟练度奖励会翻倍。",
	"When you reach 4th level, you can learn one feat of your choice.": "当你达到4级时，你可以学习一个你选择的特技。",
	"Learning a feat better suits the commoner's theme rather than taking ability score improvements. In this class, it is better to have a variety of different skills, rather than trying to master any ability.": "学习一项壮举更适合平民的主题，而不是采取能力得分的改进。在这个等级中，最好是拥有各种不同的技能，而不是试图掌握任何能力。",
	"You may not be the strongest, the toughest, the fastest or the smartest, but you can still assist! At 5th level, when you apply the {@action Help} action to aid an ally attacking an enemy in combat, then that ally may add your proficiency bonus to their own attack roll.": "你可能不是最强壮、最坚韧、最快或最聪明的人，但你仍然可以协助！你可以在战斗中应用{@action Help}的行动来协助盟友。在5级时，当你应用{@action Help}行动来协助盟友攻击战斗中的敌人时，那么该盟友可以将你的熟练度加成加入他们自己的攻击卷。",
	"If your ally's attack is successful, then you may also make a single attack targeted at that enemy immediately at the end of your ally's turn (no reaction required).": "如果你的盟友攻击成功，那么你也可以在你盟友的回合结束时立即进行一次针对该敌人的攻击（不需要反应）。",
	"At 5th level, you gain a feature granted by your Commoner Livelihood.": "在5级时，你获得一个由你的平民生活所赋予的功能。",
	"From 6th level, you realize that you can do it just like the others can. Select an ally that you have known for at least a week, and then copy the following traits from them:": "从第6级开始，你意识到你可以像其他人一样做到这一点。选择一个你认识了至少一周的盟友，然后从他们身上复制以下特征。",
	"Gain one skill or tool proficiency that they possess.": "获得他们拥有的一项技能或工具的熟练度。",
	"If the ally can cast spells, then you can learn 3 of their cantrips (using the same Spellcasting ability as they use). Otherwise, you gain one armor class proficiency and two weapon proficiencies that they possess.": "如果这个盟友能够施法，那么你可以学习他们的3个咒语（使用与他们相同的施法能力）。否则，你会获得他们所拥有的一个盔甲类熟练度和两个武器熟练度。",
	"This feature can be used a maximum of once a week. If you lose contact with that ally, you may keep the traits that you have copied from them indefinitely. If you later wish to copy from a different ally, then their new traits will replace the traits you copied previously.": "这个特征每周最多可以使用一次。如果你与该盟友失去联系，你可以无限期地保留你从他们那里复制的特质。如果你以后想从不同的盟友那里复制，那么他们的新特性将取代你之前复制的特性。",
	"At 7th level, you're getting the hang of this now. Whenever an effect or attack would inflict damage more than half your current hp, you can choose to intervene such that it inflicts only half your current hp instead (rounded up).": "在7级时，你现在已经掌握了这个技巧。每当一个效果或攻击会造成超过你当前生命值一半的伤害时，你可以选择进行干预，使其只造成你当前生命值的一半（四舍五入）。",

	"You aren't the sort to fight alone. By 10th level you've learned how to coordinate with others - you are like the glue that holds a group together. At the end of a long rest, you can pick three willing allies and form a team with them. Up until the next long rest, so long as those allies remain within both earshot and line of sight of you and each other, then the team has the following benefits:": "你不是那种单独作战的人。到了第10级，你已经学会了如何与他人协调--你就像是把一个团体凝聚在一起的胶水。在长时间休息结束后，你可以挑选三个愿意合作的盟友并与他们组成一个团队。直到下一次长时休息，只要这些盟友仍然在你和对方的耳边和视线范围内，那么这个团队就有以下好处。",

	"At 11th level, whenever you score a critical attack against an opponent during an {@action Attack} action, then you can then make a second action immediately afterwards.

This can only apply once per round of combat.": "在11级时，只要你在一个{@action Attack}的行动中对对手进行了关键攻击，那么你就可以在之后立即进行第二次行动。此外，该对手必须通过DC14+你的熟练度加成的宪法救赎，否则会变成（%1%），直到下一回合。这在每轮战斗中只能应用一次。",

That type labor builds muscle, and responsibility.": "农民--还能有什么更高尚的职业吗？嗯，是的，也许--但是，即便如此，如果你不做你的工作，那些人都会饿死。农民是坚韧的人。他们在田间劳作，你放牧牲畜，他们做所有肮脏的、背负式的工作，只是为了让其他人能够吃饱。这种类型的劳动可以锻炼肌肉，也可以培养责任感。",

The DM will inform you immediately whether or not your attempt was successful. If successful, the enemies will name a price–the exact sum dependent on the situation–and if you can pay that price then those enemy will abandon hostilities so long as your party does the same.": "此外，如果战斗开始时，敌人有理由关心这些事情（例如，如果强盗伏击你，或者如果你遇到囤积黄金的地精），那么你可以使用一个行动来中断主动权命令，并提出付款而不是战斗。DM会立即通知你，你的尝试是否成功。如果成功，敌人会开出一个价格--具体金额取决于情况--如果你能支付这个价格，那么只要你的队伍也这么做，这些敌人就会放弃敌对行动。",
	"You piece together bits and pieces, and slowly but surely enough your wares expand. At 9th level, you acquire an uncommon magic item of your choice–preferably an item related to your backstory or journey, and must be subject to the DM's approval.
