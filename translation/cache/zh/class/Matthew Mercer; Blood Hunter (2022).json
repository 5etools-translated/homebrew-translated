	"Marred but resolute, his grimacing face dripping with sweat, a half-orc reddens a finger in the blood of his own wounds, then draws a glowing ruby glyph in the air between him and the bloody behemoth facing him. He grips the weightless sigil, twisting it to unleash streams of dark energy that curse the blood of the monster's own veins to even the odds.": "一个半兽人伤痕累累，但意志坚定，他面无表情的脸上滴着汗水，在自己伤口的血液中染红了一根手指，然后在他和面对他的血腥巨兽之间的空气中画了一个发光的红宝石字样。他抓着这个没有重量的符号，扭曲它释放出黑暗能量流，诅咒怪物自己血管里的血，以扳平胜负。",
	"A mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates the site of a roadway massacre, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the grisly scene. Suddenly, she jumps to her feet, certain in the knowledge of what creature was responsible, where it can be found—and how little time she has before it kills again.": "一个神秘的半精灵披着破旧的斗篷和坚固的皮甲，小心翼翼地调查着公路上的屠杀现场，当她沉思着这可怕的场景的遗迹时，她的眼睛里闪过一丝认同。突然，她跳了起来，确信知道是什么生物造成的，在哪里可以找到它--在它再次杀人之前，她还有多少时间。",
	"Stepping into lightless chambers filled with ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling picks up the warning of imminent danger from the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting blood and essence into glowing runes of powerful magic, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.": "踏入无光的房间，里面充满了古老的灰尘和挥之不去的低语，半身人从骨头和爪子在附近石头上的刮擦声中捕捉到了危险即将来临的警告。当她用刀在手掌上划过时，她不禁打了个寒颤，钢铁将血液和精华转化为强大魔法的发光符文，渴望烙印和燃烧敌人的肉体。",
	"Blood hunters are clever warriors driven by an unending determination to destroy evils old and new. Armed with rites of secretive blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for their cause, they protect the realms from the shadows—even as they remain ever vigilant against being drawn to the darkness that consumes the monsters they hunt.": "猎血者是聪明的战士，他们被消灭新旧邪恶的无尽决心所驱动。他们以秘密的血魔法仪式为武器，并愿意为他们的事业牺牲自己的生命力和人性，他们保护王国免受阴影的影响--即使他们始终保持警惕，防止被吞噬他们猎杀的怪物的黑暗所吸引。",
	"Far from the judging eyes of society, blood hunters have mastered the secretive techniques of hemocraft, finding blood magic's esoteric nature effective against evils that resist divine rebuke or arcane bindings. Through careful study and practice, blood hunters hone the rites of hemocraft into unique combat techniques, forfeiting a portion of their own health to call blood curses down upon their enemies or summon the elements to aid their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force dedicated to protecting the innocent.": "远离社会的评判目光，血族猎人掌握了血魔法的秘密技术，发现血魔法的神秘性质对抵制神灵的责备或奥术的束缚的邪恶很有效。通过仔细的研究和实践，血族猎人将血术的仪式磨练成独特的战斗技巧，放弃自己的部分健康，向敌人发出血咒，或召唤元素来帮助他们的攻击。为了取得胜利，他们愿意承受任何代价，这些精明的战士将自己锻造成一支强大的力量，致力于保护无辜者。",
	"Whether driven by the wish to make a difference, the need to take vengeance, or the hope of finding a place to belong in an uncaring world, every blood hunter has their own reasons for undertaking the ritual of the Hunter's Bane that starts them on this path. In joining an order of blood hunters, one also joins a family bound by service to each other and a common cause. For many, this might be the only family they have left—or have ever known—making the kinship felt between blood hunters an all-but-unbreakable bond.": "无论是出于改变现状的愿望、复仇的需要，还是希望在一个无情的世界中找到归属感，每个血族猎人都有自己的理由来进行猎人之刃的仪式，从而走上这条路。在加入血族猎人组织的过程中，人们也加入了一个以服务对方和共同事业为纽带的家庭。对许多人来说，这可能是他们唯一的家庭，或者说是他们曾经知道的家庭，这使得血族猎人之间的亲情成为一种几乎不可分割的纽带。",
	"Outside the camaraderie of their orders, however, the life of a blood hunter is not an easy one. The ritual of the Hunter's Bane can leave a character visibly changed, and prone to unsettling the people around them. Likewise, witnessing hemocraft can invoke superstitious fears from even the most learned scholars. While some cultures have come to accept the good deeds of many blood hunter orders, many blood hunters hide their calling unless absolutely necessary. They feel more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world, or drift through the outskirts of society, protecting the poor and defenseless from dark intention and the corrupting touch of fiends.": "然而，在他们命令的友情之外，猎血人的生活并不轻松。猎人之刃的仪式可以让一个角色明显地改变，并且容易让他们周围的人感到不安。同样地，目睹血手艺可以唤起最博学的学者们的迷信恐惧。虽然有些文化已经接受了许多血族猎人的善行，但许多血族猎人除非绝对必要，否则都会隐藏自己的使命。他们在世界的荒野中感到更加舒适，或者在社会的郊区漂流，保护穷人和无助的人免受黑暗的意图和恶魔的腐蚀之害。",
	"In choosing this path, every blood hunter irrevocably gives a part of themself to their cause—physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. Each order of blood hunters practices its own ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of those who employ them. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle. And so a life of discipline and vigilance drives a blood hunter's travels as they wander the countryside, in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.": "在选择这条道路时，每个血族猎人都不可逆转地将自己的一部分献给了他们的事业--身体上、情感上，有时甚至是道德上。每个血族猎人组织都有自己的理想和方法，经常采用具有黑暗起源的技术，考验采用这些技术的人的力量和意志。许多人与失去这种斗争的恐惧搏斗。因此，纪律和警惕的生活驱使着血族猎人的旅行，他们在乡间游荡，寻找志同道合的冒险者和黑暗行动的耳语。",
	"As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?": "当你创造一个血腥的猎人时，你的角色最重要的方面是你为什么被驱使到这种生活方式，以及你为什么寻求放弃一切，与你所猎杀的恶魔一起沉湎于黑暗之中？你是否在邪恶的野兽面前失去了亲人，现在希望防止其他人遭受同样的命运？你是否寻求一种目标和安全感，并在接纳你的秩序中找到了这种感觉？你是否一直带着黑暗的种子，并寻求亲属来看护你，防止你屈服于它？你是否曾经是一名神圣的战士，但却偏离了他的信仰而被驱逐出去，但仍然寻求为保护无辜者的事业奉献自己？或者你是一个有着黑暗过去的罪犯，寻求弥补，把这一生作为忏悔的道路？",
	"What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises to grant you as you step closer to its mastery? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?": "你与血脉的力量和它承诺在你接近它的掌握时授予你的能力是什么关系？你是否尊重和惧怕涌动在你血管中的古老力量，只在必要时使用它们？你是否对它提供给你的力量津津乐道，拥抱你的天赋并自由使用它们？你是否担心迷信是正确的，这种力量最终会把你变成你猎杀的怪物之一？或者，你的学习已经给你灌输了心灵控制物质的自信，确信你可以弯曲这些天赋，带来更光明的曙光？",
	"Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?": "也要考虑到，虽然血族猎人属于一个教团，但许多人自己出击，做他们最好的工作。是什么让你离开了舒适的教团？你是否打算回来，或者你决定在外面的世界里有更多的东西要学？你在其他冒险者身上寻找什么，可以帮助你实现你的目标？",
	"While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemo craft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell.": "虽然大多数血族猎人在他们的追求中走的是一条善良或中立的道路，但有些人已经堕落到血族工艺的黑暗、诱人的一面，将他们的能力用于自私和邪恶的目的。这些异类总是被赶出教团，并经常与他们曾经训练过的生物一起被猎杀。",
	"You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons, or archery (or finesse weapons). Make Intelligence your next highest if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical power. Choose a higher Constitution next, as you want to have extra hit points to burn on your crimson rite or amplifying blood curses. Then, select the {@background urchin} or {@background soldier} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一个血族猎人。首先，根据你是想专注于近战武器，还是射箭（或精巧的武器），将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分。如果你打算专注于血腥诅咒和神秘力量的效力，那么智力就是你的第二高分。接下来选择一个较高的体质，因为你想有额外的命中率来燃烧你的深红仪式或放大血咒的效果。然后，选择（%0%）或（%1%）的背景。",

	"The process of undertaking the Hunter's Bane ritual is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those who survive are irrevocably changed—and not always for the better. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters honed the way in which hemocraft alters the body, using corrupted alchemy and toxic elixirs to alter their blood even further. Over time, they have modified their capabilities in battle, becoming something beyond what they once were. Calling themselves the Order of the Mutant, these blood hunters now specialize in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their foes, altering their biology to be best prepared for any conflict.": "进行 \"猎人之刃 \"仪式的过程是一个痛苦、伤痕累累、有时甚至是致命的经历。那些活下来的人都会发生不可逆转的改变，而且不一定是好的改变。经过几代人的实验，一个由血族猎人组成的小团体磨练出了血族改变身体的方式，使用腐败的炼金术和有毒的药水来进一步改变他们的血液。随着时间的推移，他们改变了自己的战斗能力，成为超越他们曾经的东西。这些血液猎手自称为 \"变种人\"，现在专门评估敌人的力量和弱点，改变他们的生物学，为任何冲突做好准备。",

You choose four mutagen formulas to learn from the options detailed at the end of this subclass description, and you can concoct one mutagen when you finish a short or long rest.": "当你完成一次休息时，你能调制的诱变剂的数量，以及你知道的配方的数量，会随着你在血液猎手类中的等级提高而增加，如上面的诱变剂工艺表所示。此外，当你学习一个新的诱变剂配方时，你可以用一个新的诱变剂配方取代你已经知道的一个配方。你可以从本子阶级描述末尾详述的选项中选择四种诱变剂配方进行学习，当你完成一次短时或长时休息时，你可以调制一种诱变剂。",

	"The ancient curse of lycanthropy is feared by nearly all peoples and cultures, passed through blood and seeding a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo \"the Taming\"—the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor-sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to their own hunger.": "狼人的古老诅咒几乎被所有的民族和文化所惧怕，它通过血液传递，给主人带来邪恶野兽的野蛮力量和对暴力的渴望。狼人骑士团是一个自豪的血腥猎人团体，他们接受 \"驯服\"--由骑士团的高级成员对那些在寻求这条道路之前还没有携带诅咒的人进行仪式性的狼人化。然后，这些猎人利用他们血液的魔力来驾驭他们所怀有的怪物的力量，而不至于让自己迷失在其中。利用强烈的意志和秘密的血魔法仪式，狼人骑士团的成员学会了在短时间内控制和释放他们的混合形态。强化的体能、非自然的复原力和锋利的爪子使这些战士成为任何与他们擦肩而过的恶魔的可怕敌人。然而，没有任何训练是完美的，如果不注意和完全专注，即使是最伟大的血族猎人也会暂时迷失在自己的饥饿中。",

	"Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible weight it imposes on them and the challenges it brings. Where most afflicted by the curse of lycanthropy grow wicked, deranged, and even murderous, Lycan blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and the power of their blood magic. A member of the Order of the Lycan cannot spread their curse through blood unless they wish to, and one of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another creature without the order's sanction.": "那些加入狼人组织的人坚定地选择了这条道路，了解它给他们带来的可怕压力和挑战。大多数被狼人的诅咒所困扰的人都会变得邪恶、疯狂，甚至杀人，而狼人血猎手则接受野兽的馈赠，同时通过严格的训练和血魔法的力量保持控制。狼人组织的成员不能通过血液传播他们的诅咒，除非他们愿意，而且这个组织最神圣的誓言之一就是在没有组织批准的情况下绝不感染其他生物。",
