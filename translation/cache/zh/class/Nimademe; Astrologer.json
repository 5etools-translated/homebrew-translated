	"Beneath the night sky, an elf is bathed in light as she focuses on a ritual. Her enemy approaches without fear or hesitation, believing she was foolish enough to leave an opening. As the enemy prepares to strike, an unseen force pushes them away from the elf. Before they can comprehend what is happening, the ritual is complete and several darts of light shoot at them.": "在夜空下，一个精灵沐浴在光中，她专注于一个仪式。她的敌人毫不畏惧、毫不犹豫地靠近，认为她愚蠢到留下了一个缺口。当敌人准备攻击时，一股看不见的力量将他们从精灵身边推开。在他们能够理解发生了什么之前，仪式已经完成，几支光的飞镖射向他们。",
	"A dwarf paces back and forth, trapped deeply in thought. The future held countless possibilities, but only one of them would come to pass. Would his kingdom survive, or would it be conquered by the empire? He doesn't know the answer, but he does know where to find it. He opens the door and leaves his home, searching for the truth hidden in the sky.": "一个矮人来回踱步，深陷于思考之中。未来有无数的可能性，但其中只有一个会成为现实。他的王国会幸存下来，还是会被帝国征服？他不知道答案，但他知道在哪里可以找到答案。他打开门，离开他的家，寻找隐藏在天空中的真相。",
	"As a war rages around him, a human distracts an enemy soldier with a haze of moonlight. He counts every agonizing second spent on his ritual as he relies on his allies to protect him. After what seems like forever, his patience is rewarded. A warm light heals his wounded allies, and the war goes on.": "当战争在他周围肆虐时，一个人类用朦胧的月光引开了一名敌军士兵。当他依靠盟友保护他的时候，他计算着在仪式上花费的每一秒钟的痛苦。经过看似漫长的时间，他的耐心得到了回报。一道温暖的光线治愈了他受伤的盟友，战争继续进行。",
	"Astrologers stand at the pinnacle of rituals, making use of them both outside and inside of combat. By using the power of the cosmos to align the magic around them, they form the ideal circumstances for a spell to manifest. Which spells they can manifest depends on the celestial body they're attuned to. They can call forth fire and light from the sun, healing and trickery from the moon, or force and travel from the stars.": "占星师站在仪式的顶峰，在战斗之外和战斗之内都利用它们。通过使用宇宙的力量来调整他们周围的魔法，他们为咒语的显现形成了理想的环境。他们能显现哪些法术取决于他们所适应的天体。他们可以从太阳召唤出火和光，从月亮召唤出治疗和诡计，或者从星星召唤出力量和旅行。",
	"Astrology is the study of celestial bodies, and the lion's share of an astrologer's time is devoted to it. Through observation of the sky above, they're able to learn about almost anything. Whether they desire to know what the future holds or how to read a language, knowledge is rarely more than a night away. Because they're able to obtain knowledge through astrology, astrologers are often found as court mages, seers, or oracles.": "占星术是对天体的研究，占星师的大部分时间都用在这上面。通过对上方天空的观察，他们几乎能够了解任何事情。无论他们是想知道未来会发生什么，还是想知道如何阅读一种语言，知识很少会超过一个晚上的时间。因为他们能够通过占星术获得知识，占星师经常被发现为宫廷法师、预言家或神谕者。",
	"Though the sky can be seen wherever you are in the world, astrologers tend to wander. Each location has a different sky, and an astrologer can learn from each and every one of them. For the sake of learning everything they can, they travel to the ends of the earth. Adventuring goes hand in hand with travel, and due to that, many astrologers choose to be adventurers.": "虽然在世界任何地方都可以看到天空，但占星师往往会去流浪。每个地方都有不同的天空，而占星师可以从每一个地方学习。为了学习一切可以学习的东西，他们走遍了天涯海角。冒险与旅行相辅相成，由于这个原因，许多占星师选择成为冒险家。",
	"A spellcaster can normally bring a spell into existence with a mere word or gesture, but that isn't the case for an astrologer. They specialize in the art of ritual casting, of causing a spell to come into existence without expending their own energy. They have an array of rituals learned through astrology, the most important being the cosmic ritual they use in combat.": "一个施法者通常只需用一句话或一个手势就能使咒语生效，但占星师却不是这样的。他们专注于仪式施法的艺术，在不耗费自身能量的情况下使咒语产生。他们有一系列通过占星术学习的仪式，最重要的是他们在战斗中使用的宇宙仪式。",
	"A cosmic ritual is the act of using the power of the cosmos to align the magic around the astrologer, which allows them to manifest spells they otherwise couldn't and reduces the casting time of the ritual from minutes to seconds. Even with the fast casting time, astrologers in the past were vulnerable when they performed a cosmic ritual because they couldn't defend themselves as they performed it. This was solved by taking a portion of the magic used to perform the ritual and converting it into light, specifically sunlight, moonlight, and starlight. This light can be used to strike enemies, distract them with a haze, or hurl them around without any effort.": "宇宙仪式是利用宇宙的力量来调整占星师周围的魔法，这使他们能够表现出他们本来无法做到的法术，并将仪式的施法时间从几分钟缩短到几秒钟。即使有了快速的施法时间，过去的占星师在进行宇宙仪式时也很脆弱，因为他们在进行仪式时无法保护自己。这个问题的解决方法是将用于执行仪式的一部分魔法转化为光，特别是太阳光、月光和星光。这种光可以用来打击敌人，用阴霾分散他们的注意力，或者不费吹灰之力就能把他们甩出去。",
	"When making an astrologer character, consider the following. Where did you learn astrology? Were you taught it by another astrologer, or did you learn about it yourself? Do you believe in destiny, and if you do, do you believe that destiny can be defied? What do you think is your destiny or your purpose?": "在制作占星师角色时，要考虑以下几点。你在哪里学的占星术？你是由其他占星师教的，还是你自己学的？你相信命运吗？如果你相信，你相信命运是可以违背的吗？你认为什么是你的命运或你的目的？",
	"Do you prefer day or night? Do you want to create your own astral sign, or are you satisfied with the astral signs already in the sky? What sort of sky do you want to see? How do you feel when you aren't able to see the sky?": "你喜欢白天还是晚上？你想创造你自己的星象，还是对天空中已有的星象感到满意？你想看到什么样的天空？当你不能够看到天空时，你有什么感觉？",
	"You can make an astrologer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the {@spell comprehend languages} and {@spell find familiar} spells as your rituals.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名占星师。首先，智力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是灵巧或体质。第二，选择圣人背景。第三，选择（%0%）和（%1%）的法术作为你的仪式。",
	"As a scholar of astrology, you're able to cast spells by aligning the magic around you with a unique ritual.": "作为一个占星术的学者，你能够通过独特的仪式来调整你周围的魔法，从而施展法术。",
	"You can use your bonus action to enter a Cosmic Ritual. While you're in a Cosmic Ritual, you gain 1 star point each time you use Cosmic Alignment. During your turn, you can end the ritual (no action required) and expend a number of star points to instantly cast an astrologer spell, requiring no material components. The number of star points you need to spend to cast an astrologer spell is equal to 1 + the spell's level. You can spend additional star points to increase the level of an astrologer spell that you cast. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional star point you spend.": "你可以使用你的额外行动来进入一个宇宙仪式。当你在宇宙仪式中时，你每次使用宇宙排列都会获得1星点。在你的回合中，你可以结束仪式（不需要行动），并消耗一定数量的星点来即时施展一个占星师法术，不需要任何物质成分。你施展占星师法术所需的星点数量等于1+法术的等级。你可以花费额外的星点来提高你所施展的占星师法术的等级。你每花费一个额外的星点，该咒语的等级就会增加1。",
	"While you have at least 1 star point, you cast bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. While you have at least 5 star points, you instead cast bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.": "当你有至少1个星点时，你在5英尺范围内施放亮光，另外5英尺范围内施放暗光。当你拥有至少5个星点时，你可以在半径15英尺的范围内施放亮光，并在额外的15英尺内施放暗光。",

If you have any star points remaining when the ritual ends, the star points vanish.": "一个宇宙仪式持续1分钟。如果你昏迷，如果你进入另一个宇宙仪式，或者你选择结束它（不需要任何行动），仪式就会提前结束。如果你在仪式结束时还有剩余的星点，这些星点会消失。",
	"The maximum number of star points you can spend to cast an astrologer spell in this way (including any additional star points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your astrologer level, as shown in the Spells and Star Points table.": "你以这种方式施展占星师法术所能花费的最大星点（包括你为提高其等级所花费的任何额外星点）由你的占星师等级决定，如法术和星点表中所示。",
	"Once you have used Cosmic Ritual the number of times shown for your astrologer level in the Cosmic Rituals column of the Astrologer table, you must finish a long rest before you can use Cosmic Ritual again.": "一旦你使用宇宙仪式的次数达到占星师表的宇宙仪式一栏中你的占星师等级所显示的次数，你必须完成一个长时间的休息才能再次使用宇宙仪式。",

You prepare each listed spell with an indicated level equal to or lower than your astrologer level.": "你准备好可供你施展的占星师法术清单。选择一个天体太阳、月亮或星星，并查阅相关列表。你准备每个列出的法术，其指示等级等于或低于你的占星师等级。",
	"When you finish a long rest, you can choose a different celestial body and prepare that list of spells instead.": "当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你可以选择一个不同的天体，并准备该法术清单来代替。",

In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an astrologer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的占星师法术的施法能力，所以每当法术提到你的施法能力时，你就会使用你的智力。此外，在设定你所施展的占星师法术的蓄力DC时，以及在用占星师法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的智力修改器。",
