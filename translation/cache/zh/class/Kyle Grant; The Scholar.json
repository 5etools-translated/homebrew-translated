	"A human general, clad in gleaming armor, studies the map on the table in front of him, covered in figurines that represent units of his soldiers and invading orcs. He consults a leather-bound journal filled with notes he's made on the enemy's tribe, their customs and battle tactics, and he moves two pieces confidently forward.": "一个身穿闪亮盔甲的人类将军研究他面前桌子上的地图，上面布满了代表他的士兵和入侵的兽人单位的小雕像。他查阅了一本装满了他对敌人的部落、他们的习俗和战斗战术所做的笔记的皮制日记，然后他自信地向前移动了两枚棋子。",
	"A wild-haired dwarf stands at the head of a long caravan. She surveys the valley below and plots their course through the untamed wilds. Unrolling a sheaf of parchment, she sketches in new features on an expertly drawn map and then motions for the caravan to follow, leading them deeper into unknown territory in search of treasure and knowledge. ": "一个野性十足的矮人站在长长的大篷车的前面。她打量着下面的山谷，规划着他们在未开化的荒野中的路线。她展开一卷羊皮纸，在一张熟练绘制的地图上勾勒出新的特征，然后示意商队跟随，带领他们深入未知领域，寻找宝藏和知识。",
	"The halfling's medical kit opens with a snap, and he quickly starts removing instruments and vials as he looks over his patient, coming to a diagnosis as he observes her symptoms. He mixes a tincture and applies a salve to her lesions. Her condition is advanced, but not beyond his skills. As he administers the treatment he glances up and sees his next patient coming through the door, nursing a wrist bent to an odd angle. He reaches into his bag for a splint as he takes back the vial with his tincture.": "半身人的医药箱 \"啪 \"地一声打开了，他迅速开始取出仪器和药瓶，一边观察病人，一边得出诊断。他混合了一种酊剂，将药膏涂在她的病灶上。她的病情很严重，但没有超出他的技能范围。当他进行治疗时，他抬头看到下一个病人进了门，他的手腕弯曲成一个奇怪的角度。他在拿回装着酊剂的小瓶时，伸手到包里拿了一个夹板。",

	"A scholar's true devotion is to understanding. Real knowledge pushes beyond trivia, from the what to the why and how. This distinction is critical to scholars, a defining aspect of the curiosity that drives them to learn and to  adventure. The wisest among them realizes that, while there may be no unsolvable mysteries, no single mortal can hope to solve them all. And so, for many, learning is a lifelong pursuit. ": "学者的真正奉献在于理解。真正的知识超越了琐事，从什么到为什么和如何。这种区别对学者来说至关重要，是驱动他们学习和探险的好奇心的一个决定性方面。他们中最聪明的人意识到，虽然可能没有无法解决的谜团，但没有一个凡人能够希望解决所有的谜团。因此，对许多人来说，学习是一种终生的追求。",
	"For the truly curious, the adventuring life is the only way to expand one's horizons of knowledge and build one's skill. Any scholar worth his salt will agree that libraries and laboratories are excellent avenues for learning, but no books or beakers contain the knowledge still waiting to be discovered beyond the frontier or in the crucible of battle. The scholar believes that every student reaches a point where the most effective path to higher learning is hands-on experience. The world is full of discoveries waiting to be made. ": "对于真正好奇的人来说，冒险生活是扩大知识视野和培养技能的唯一途径。任何有价值的学者都会同意，图书馆和实验室是很好的学习途径，但没有任何书籍或烧杯能包含在边境之外或在战斗的熔炉中仍在等待发现的知识。学者认为，每个学生都会达到一个点，即通向高等学府的最有效途径是亲身体验。世界上充满了等待被发现的东西。",
	"While most scholars have broad intellectual interests, all of them pursue a particular field of expertise to which they have likely dedicated years of study before becoming adventurers.
