	"The exact details of the demi-dragon transformation are unclear, but the nature of innate dragon magic hints at multiple paths to the same result. Whether accomplished through magical prowess, alchemy, zealous devotion, or by bathing in dragon's blood, the transformation draws upon the essence of a true dragon to instill a spark of magic within the subject, forcing them to take on the physical characteristics of a dragon. Though adopting the shape of a dragon during the transformation, the subject is often brought only halfway there, and can be left temporarily scaleless or wingless. Such deficiencies tend to correct themselves over time - but once transformed, there is no known way to reverse the metamorphosis.": "半龙人变身的具体细节尚不清楚，但先天的龙族魔法的性质暗示了通往同一结果的多种途径。无论是通过魔法能力、炼金术、狂热的奉献，还是通过沐浴龙血来完成，这种转变都是借助于真龙的精髓，在对象体内灌输魔法的火花，迫使他们具备龙的身体特征。虽然在变身过程中采用了龙的形状，但受试者往往只达到了一半，可能会暂时没有鳞片或没有翅膀。这种缺陷往往会随着时间的推移而得到纠正--但一旦被转化，就没有已知的方法来逆转这种蜕变。",
