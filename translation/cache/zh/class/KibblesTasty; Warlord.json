	"Two vast armies stand across the field of death, fear gripping the heart of every soldier. From their ranks, the banner is carried forth - a shining beacon without fear. Before they even know it, their feet pound across the ground, their fear left behind as they follow their symbol of hope to victory.": "两支庞大的军队站在死亡的战场上，恐惧笼罩着每个士兵的心。从他们的队伍中，旗帜被抬了出来--一个没有恐惧的闪亮灯塔。在他们意识到这一点之前，他们的脚步已经踏过地面，他们的恐惧被抛在身后，因为他们跟随希望的象征走向胜利。",
	"Collapsing to the ground, a man succumbs to wounds, exhaustion, terror, and the overwhelming clash of steel all around. Death closes in, but before it can claim him, a hand appears, pulling him to his feet.": "一个人倒在地上，屈服于伤口、疲惫、恐惧和周围铺天盖地的钢铁碰撞。死亡逼近，但在它能夺走他之前，一只手出现了，把他拉到了自己的位置。",
	"\"On your feet, soldier.\"": "\"站起来，士兵。\"",
	"The line will soon be overrun—until, among the broken ranks of soldiers, a lone soldier spots his liege. She stands, unwilling to turn aside, unwilling to step back from danger, holding back the horde of enemies alone. Retreat is no longer an option. With newfound strength behind every blow, the soldiers stand and fight like no one has ever fought before.": "战线很快就会被攻破--直到在破碎的士兵队伍中，一个孤独的士兵发现了他的女主人。她站在那里，不愿意转向，不愿意从危险中退缩，独自挡住了敌人的大军。撤退已不再是一个选项。在每一次打击背后都有新的力量，士兵们站起来，以前所未有的方式战斗。",
	"\"How did you do it?\" hisses the marauder, his sword dropped before him in surrender. He kneels beside his captured comrades, encircled by a smaller force that seems to have come from nowhere. The victorious general smiles knowingly and shrugs.": "\"你是怎么做到的？\"掠夺者嘶吼着，他的剑掉在他面前，以示投降。他跪在他被俘的战友身边，被一支似乎从哪里来的小部队包围着。胜利的将军明知故问地笑了笑，耸耸肩。",
	"\"Luck,\" he says. \"And perhaps a bit of planning.\"": "\"运气，\"他说。\"也许还有一点计划。\"",
	"Warlords are force multipliers for their companions. Some may be fearsome combatants, while others may never lift a weapon, but in either case their presence on the battlefield will drive their allies to new heights, guiding them safely through what would surely have been their doom.": "军阀是其同伴的力量倍增器。有些人可能是可怕的战斗员，而另一些人可能从未举起过武器，但无论如何，他们在战场上的存在将推动他们的盟友达到新的高度，引导他们安全度过本来肯定是他们的厄运。",
	"How victory is stolen from the jaws of defeat can vary, from inciting crazed zeal, to tempering an overeager charge, to pulling their friends out of the line of danger in the nick of time. The sole commonality is that a Warlord alone is but a man, while a Warlord with their companions is a legend.": "如何从失败中夺取胜利，可以有不同的方式，从煽动疯狂的热情，到缓和过度的冲锋，再到在关键时刻把他们的朋友从危险中拉出来。唯一的共同点是，一个军阀只是一个人，而一个军阀和他们的同伴在一起就是一个传奇。",
	"Purpose is a common element to those that walk the path of a Warlord. Purpose empowers Warlords to be a larger-than-life, and allows them to be a guiding hand to their comrades. Some Warlords may not seek any particular cause, and merely pursue victory - either as a tribute to a god they worship or simply to attain meet a personal glory. More often, though, a Warlord is driven by a higher purpose - a loyalty to their country or their men, a drive to protect the innocent or crush the weak.": "目标是走军阀之路的人的共同要素。宗旨使军阀能够成为一个比生命更重要的人，并使他们能够成为战友们的指导者。有些军阀可能不寻求任何特定的原因，而只是追求胜利--无论是作为对他们所崇拜的神的致敬，还是仅仅为了满足个人的荣耀。但更多的时候，军阀是由一个更高的目标驱动的--对他们的国家或士兵的忠诚，保护无辜者或粉碎弱者的动力。",
	"Purpose is an important consideration to a Warlord in understanding why they fight, as it will inform how they fight. Do they try to keep their companions and followers out of danger? Or do they simply press for the strategy that is most likely to win?": "目的是一个重要的考虑因素，以了解他们为什么战斗，因为这将告知他们如何战斗。他们是否试图让自己的同伴和追随者远离危险？还是他们只是按最有可能获胜的策略行事？",
	"Most warlords have no explicitly magical powers, but the presence on the battlefield allows people to exceed what they might have thought of as their own limits, pushing beyond what they could hope to achieve on their own. A Walord will make their allies feel like they've become better at everything, they will make problems seem surmountable, and they will make the path clear. They make the world less bleak, they make the foes less terrifying. When you have a Warlord on yourside, more things go right.": "大多数军阀没有明确的魔力，但在战场上的存在使人们能够超越他们可能认为的自己的极限，超越他们自己希望实现的目标。一个华罗庚会让他们的盟友觉得自己在一切方面都变得更好，他们会让问题看起来可以克服，他们会让道路变得清晰。他们使世界不那么暗淡，他们使敌人不那么可怕。当你有一个军阀在你身边时，更多的事情都会顺利进行。",
	"Just as a dragon's frightful presence instills a supernatural dread in mortal adventurers, a Warlord's presence is more than just simple common sense and a head for strategy, it is the power of conviction, the perfection of tactics, or the will to win incarnated in Adventurer form.": "就像龙的可怕存在给凡人冒险者灌输了超自然的恐惧一样，战神的存在不仅仅是简单的常识和战略头脑，它是信念的力量，战术的完美，或者说是冒险者形式的胜利意志的化身。",
	"When creating a Warlord you should always start with answering the question: what sort of Presence does this person bring to the battlefield? Are they a charismatic inspiration to their allies that drives them to fight on? Are they a wise veteran who acts as a force multiplier for their companions, offering pointers and grit? Or are they a scheming manipulator who sees one step ahead of any move their foes can make, always making sure their allies are in the right spot?": "在创建军阀时，你应该总是从回答这个问题开始：这个人在战场上带来什么样的存在感？他们是否是激励盟友的魅力，促使他们继续战斗？他们是一个明智的老兵，为他们的同伴提供指导和勇气，起到了力量倍增的作用？或者他们是一个诡计多端的操纵者，在他们的敌人可能做出的任何举动之前就能看到一步，总是确保他们的盟友处于正确的位置？",
	"Any of these paths and many more are all possible through the Warlord, but what sort of Presence you select at level one will guide what attribute is most impactful for you in exerting your influence and driving your companions to greater heights.": "这些途径中的任何一条以及更多的途径都可以通过军阀来实现，但你在第一级选择什么样的存在，将引导你在发挥你的影响力和推动你的同伴达到更高的高度时，哪种属性对你最有影响。",
	"You can make a warlord quickly by following these suggestions. For a Chieftain or Paragon select Strength as your highest attribute followed by Charisma. For a Commander select Strength as your highest attribute followed by Wisdom.": "按照这些建议，你可以快速地制造一个军阀。对于首领或准将来说，选择力量作为你的最高属性，然后是魅力。对于指挥官来说，选择力量作为你的最高属性，然后是智慧。",
	"For a Noble select Charisma as your highest attribute followed by Constitution, and for a Tactician select Intelligence followed by Constitution.": "对于贵族来说，选择魅力作为你的最高属性，然后是体质，对于战术家来说，选择智力，然后是体质。",
	"At 1st level, you pick the archetype of Warlord you embody, called a Presence. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.": "在1级时，你选择你所体现的战神原型，称为 \"存在感\"。你的选择在1级时赋予你特性，并在3级、7级、11级、15级和18级时再次赋予你特性。",
	"Starting at 1st level, when you take the {@action Attack} action, in place of making an attack, you can use your Battlefield Presence to grant a friendly creature that can see or hear you an additional attack the next time they take the {@action Attack} action during their turn.": "从第一级开始，当你采取（%0%）行动时，你可以使用你的战场存在来给予一个能看到或听到你的友方生物一次额外的攻击，在他们的回合中，当他们采取（%1%）行动时。",
	"Any additional attacks granted that are unused at the start of your next turn are lost. A friendly creature can only gain one additional attack from this feature per round.": "在你的下一回合开始时，任何被授予的额外攻击都会失去。一个友好的生物每回合只能从这个特征获得一次额外的攻击。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you have access to Leadership Dice. These represent your ability to focus your battlefield presence to powerful results. Your Warlord level determines the number and size of the dice, as shown on the Leadership Dice column of the Warlord table. You can spend these to fuel various features.": "从2级开始，你可以使用领导力骰子。这些骰子代表了你的能力，可以集中你在战场上的力量取得强大的结果。你的军阀等级决定了骰子的数量和大小，如军阀表的领导力骰子栏所示。你可以用这些骰子来推动各种功能。",
	"You start knowing three such features: Rallying Mark, Urgent Orders, and Helpful Word. When you get this feature, you can spend one Leadership Die per turn.

	"As a bonus action, you can expend a number of Leadership Dice (up to your per turn limit) to rally your allies to attack a hostile creature within 60 feet of you.": "作为一个额外的行动，你可以消耗一定数量的领导力骰子（不超过你每回合的上限）来召集你的盟友攻击你周围60英尺内的一个敌对生物。",
	"The next time damage is rolled against that target by an allied creature before the start of your next turn, they can add the Leadership Dice to the damage roll, and the attacking creature regains hit points equal to the amount rolled on the Leadership Dice.": "下次在你的下一回合开始前，同盟生物对该目标卷起伤害时，他们可以在伤害卷上加上领导力骰子，而攻击的生物会重新获得与领导力骰子所卷数量相等的打击点数。",
	"As a bonus action, you can expend a number of Leadership Dice (up to your per turn limit) to guide your allies in expeditious action.": "作为一个额外的行动，你可以消耗一定数量的领导力骰子（不超过你每回合的上限）来引导你的盟友快速行动。",

	"Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency one of the {@skill Persuasion}, {@skill Intimidation}, {@skill Insight} or {@skill Investigation}.
