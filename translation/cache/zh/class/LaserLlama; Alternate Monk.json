	"The young man took a deep breath and steadied himself as the ogre charged him. Thinking back to his training he prepared to counter the incoming blow. As the ogre's club struck the dirt where he had been only moments before, the young man drew upon his reservoir of spiritual power and let fly a flurry of blows upon the unsuspecting beast. Before the hulking ogre realized what had happened, it lay stunned in the mud. Hopefully, when the ogre regained consciousness it would think twice before raiding the local homesteads.": "年轻人深吸一口气，在食人魔冲向他时稳住了自己。回想一下他的训练，他准备反击即将到来的打击。当食人魔的棍子打在他刚才所在的泥土上时，这个年轻人利用他的精神力量库，对这个毫无防备的野兽进行了一阵猛烈的打击。在巨大的食人魔意识到发生了什么之前，它就已经呆呆地躺在泥地里了。希望当食人魔恢复意识时，它在袭击当地人的家园之前会三思而行。",

As quietly as they had arrived, the dark hobgoblin assassins disappeared into the night.": "在没有月亮的夜晚，一队地精刺客在黑暗中悄悄移动，接近了敌方将军的帐篷。从出生开始就接受武术训练，这些致命的战士无声无息地杀死了敌人的卫兵。当将军从睡梦中惊醒时，他的眼睛睁得大大的，因为妖精们似乎是从黑暗中出现的。他试图呼救，但他嘴里没有发出任何声音，因为他的生命被刺客们无情地扼杀了。就像他们到达时一样悄无声息，黑暗的妖精刺客们消失在黑夜中。",
	"The Grand Master stepped forward to block the pass. As her students reluctantly fled into the mountains, she studied the horde of goblins that would soon be upon her. Though she was the most powerful living Wu Jen master, even in her prime she could not hope to slay half this many foes. She dropped her cloak from her shoulders, and her tattoos glistened with elemental magic as she prepared to bring down the mountain itself down upon her. Though she would most certainly perish, the pass would be blocked, and most importantly, her students would be able to escape.": "大法师走上前去，堵住了通道。当她的学生们不情愿地逃进山里时，她研究了很快就会出现在她面前的妖精群。虽然她是在世的最强大的吴仁宝，但即使在她的全盛时期，她也不可能希望杀死这么多敌人的一半。她放下肩上的斗篷，身上的纹身闪烁着元素魔法的光芒，她准备将山峰本身降到她身上。虽然她肯定会死，但通道会被堵住，最重要的是，她的学生们将能够逃脱。",
