A fate weaver should never be alone though, do not mistake their special power to make them unstoppable. A fate weaver is the perfect person to have alongside you in a fight, but don't count on them to handle themselves on their own.

	"Fate weavers are not just like any other wizard who can draw power from the weave, or a cleric who receives their power from a divine entity. Fate weavers are more akin to sorcerers in that their magic stems directly from the weave itself, but on an even greater scale.

Mystra, the goddess of magic, alongside The Raven Queen, the goddess of death and fate, are like 'god mothers' to these children of the weave.

	"Despite their direct connection to the weave, many fate weavers have trouble learning magic outside of healing, divination, and abjuration magic.

	"At 10th level, you have always kept your mind open to trying new things and can pick up skills on the fly. When you finish a long rest, choose any one skill of which you are not proficient in. You add half of your proficiency bonus to any ability checks using that skill until you next finish a long rest, after which you can choose the same skill or a different skill to gain this benefit.": "在10级的时候，你一直保持着开放的心态去尝试新的事物，并且可以随手拿起技能。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，选择任何一个你不精通的技能。你对任何使用该技能的能力检查都会增加一半的熟练度加成，直到你下次完成长休，之后你可以选择相同的技能或不同的技能来获得这个好处。",
	"Also at 10th level, choose two of your skill or tool proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 18th level, you choose two more of your skill or tool proficiencies to gain this benefit.": "同样在10级时，从你的技能或工具熟练度中选择两项。在你进行任何使用所选技能的能力检查时，你的熟练度加成会加倍。在18级时，你可以再选择两个技能或工具的熟练度来获得这个好处。",
	"At 14th level, you take unnecessary risks to get what you want or maybe just to have fun. As a reaction whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you can choose to roll at disadvantage instead by spending a fate die. You cannot benefit from any advantages when you do so. Also, you roll the fate die and add it to the roll. If you succeed, you automatically receive the best outcome of the result treating the d20 roll as a 20. On a failure, you automatically receive the worst possible outcome, treating the d20 roll as a 1 and doubling any damage dealt to you as a result if you were to take any.": "在14级时，你会冒不必要的风险来获得你想要的东西，也许只是为了找点乐子。作为一种反应，每当你进行攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷时，你可以选择用一个命运骰子来代替劣势卷。当你这样做的时候，你不能从任何优势中获益。同时，你要掷出命运之骰，并将其加入卷轴。如果你成功了，你会自动得到最好的结果，把D20卷当作20。如果失败，你会自动得到最坏的结果，将d20的卷轴视为1，并且如果你受到任何伤害，你的伤害会加倍。",

Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix's power dwells within you.": "你的力量来自不朽的火焰，它为传说中的凤凰提供动力。你或你的祖先也许为凤凰做出了巨大的贡献，或者你出生在它的身边。不管是什么原因，凤凰的力量的碎片就住在你体内。",
	"That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can't bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.": "这种力量是一种混合的祝福。像神话中的生物一样，你可以调用火热的能量，获得欺骗死亡本身的能力。这种力量是有代价的。你体内的火焰沸腾着，要求被释放出来。你有时会发现自己心不在焉地在喂火。你不忍心让火熄灭。当你拿着点燃的火把或坐在篝火前时，你感觉最舒服。",
	"More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Those of this aspect can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.": "更重要的是，这种天赋并没有带来对火的特殊保护。你和其他生物一样容易受到火系魔法的伤害，包括你自己的。这方面的人可以用他们的力量把自己从死亡的边缘拉回来，而他们自己轻率的天性或对破坏性魔法的依赖往往是把他们放在那里的原因。",
	"At 1st level, you gain the ability to start fires with a touch. You learn the {@spell Produce Flame} cantrip and it doesn't count against your total known cantrips.

If you choose, the object can take fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus, and continue to do so at the start of each of your subsequent turns thereafter. ": "此外，作为一个动作，你可以用魔法点燃一个你用手触摸的易燃物--比如火把、一块煤球或窗帘的下摆。当你这样做的时候，该物体不能由你以外的任何人佩戴或携带。如果你选择，该物体可以受到与你的熟练度加成相等的火灾伤害，并在此后的每个回合开始时继续这样做。",

	"Starting at 10th level, if your Mantle of the Phoenix would end, as a reaction you can spend a hit die as if you were regaining hit points during a short rest. Instead of healing, you take damage equal to what you roll, and the duration of your mantle increases by a number of rounds equal to half the damage you took plus one round (to a minimum of 2 rounds). This damage cannot be reduced by any means.": "从10级开始，如果你的凤凰之咒会结束，作为一个反应，你可以花费一个命中率，就像你在短暂的休息中恢复命中率一样。与其说是治疗，不如说你受到的伤害与你掷出的伤害相等，而且你的护身符的持续时间会增加，增加的回合数等于你所受伤害的一半加一回合（最少为2回合）。这种伤害不能以任何方式减少。",
