	"A tattooed elf, veiled and cloaked, draws his obsidian dagger across the sand, calling forth from the lines a ghostly apparition to help him and his allies find their way. A trio of halfling hermits gather among candles and incense, chanting words of power to bait spirits from the shadows. The bejeweled human, dressed in exotic garb and golden chains bellows a spell which echoes with the voices of an army of lost souls, a fiendish glint in his eyes as blood drips from his palm.": "一个有纹身的精灵，戴着面纱和斗篷，用他的黑曜石匕首划过沙地，从线条中召唤出一个幽灵般的幽灵来帮助他和他的盟友找到他们的路。三个半身人的隐士聚集在蜡烛和香火中，念叨着权力的话语，以诱使阴影中的灵魂。穿着异国服装和金色锁链的珠光宝气的人类发出咒语，与迷失的灵魂大军的声音相呼应，他的眼中闪烁着邪恶的光芒，血液从他的手掌中滴落。",
	"Unlike shamans who pray to the spirits of nature, witches trap the tormented souls of those lost betwixt the realm of the living and the beyond. As a witch, you learn to summon these souls and bind them to your will, gaining protection from them and power over them. As you attain higher levels, the covenant you choose to live by grants you further abilities which extend the utility and power of these bonds in different ways.": "与向自然之灵祈祷的巫师不同，女巫将那些迷失在活人领域和超自然领域之间的受折磨的灵魂困在其中。作为一名女巫，你要学会召唤这些灵魂，并将它们与你的意志结合起来，获得对它们的保护和力量。随着你达到更高的等级，你选择的盟约会赋予你更多的能力，以不同的方式扩展这些束缚的效用和力量。",
	"Witches may or may not have a level of respect for the spirits they bind, though one could say they should. Some witches tap into the residual energies of long-departed souls, while others use extant spiritual beings as conduits for their spellcasting. Either way and whether or not they wish, witches bind part of their own soul to those that surround them.": "巫师们可能会也可能不会对他们捆绑的灵魂有一定程度的尊重，尽管可以说他们应该如此。有些女巫利用早已逝去的灵魂的残余能量，而有些女巫则利用现存的精神生物作为他们施法的渠道。无论哪种方式，无论他们是否愿意，女巫都会将自己的部分灵魂与周围的人结合起来。",
	"Witch spells mostly deal with manipulation of spiritual energies (both living and dead) and protections against the beings who supply those energies. As part of their connection to the spiritual world, they are also privy to information and secrets normally not meant for mortal minds. As such, witches are powerful enchanters, abjurers, and diviners.": "巫师的法术主要涉及操纵精神能量（包括活的和死的），以及对提供这些能量的人的保护。作为她们与精神世界联系的一部分，她们也能知道通常不属于凡人的信息和秘密。因此，女巫是强大的施法者、施咒者和占卜者。",
	"Witches acknowledge that there is a spiritual connection between all things—forces that inexplicably and randomly bind beings and happenings together in a shared fate or destiny. They see other witches as brothers and sisters, and other classes as close cousins. As a consequence, witches are often fond of forming alliances. One kind of alliance is the circle that a witch belongs to.": "女巫们承认，万物之间有一种精神联系--有一种力量莫名其妙地、随机地将各种生物和事件捆绑在一起，形成共同的命运，或命运。他们视其他巫师为兄弟姐妹，视其他阶级为亲密的表亲。因此，女巫们常常喜欢结成联盟。一种联盟是女巫所属的圈子。",
	"The covenant that a witch joins is the manifestation of a philosophy regarding the nature of spirits. Some, like the covenant of unity, believe in a supreme energy that extends beyond the physical world, weaving together magic and the collective conscience of all living things. Others, from the covenant of blood for example, believe in a more intimate connection between the physical world and the other side. In this philosophy, each soul is tied to something close to it in the physical world—a body, an object, or location that was important to it when it was alive.": "巫师加入的盟约是关于精神本质的哲学的表现。有些人，比如团结之约，相信有一种超越物质世界的最高能量，将魔法和所有生物的集体意识编织在一起。其他人，例如来自血缘之约的人，相信物理世界和另一个世界之间有更亲密的联系。在这种哲学中，每个灵魂都与它在物理世界中接近的东西联系在一起--身体、物体或它活着时的重要位置。",
	"When deciding to play a witch, think about what led your character to tap into the spirit world. Maybe witchcraft is a tradition in the area, or your character comes from an area rife with a ghostly past. Superstition is also a good trigger for a fascination with spirits. What is your relationship with spirits? Is there a measure of mutual respect? Perhaps your character feels more like a servant to the spirit than the other way around, or maybe they possess the entitlement to dominate and extort spiritual beings.": "当决定扮演一个女巫时，想想是什么导致你的角色进入精神世界。也许巫术是该地区的传统，或者你的角色来自一个充斥着鬼魂的地区。迷信也是迷恋鬼魂的一个很好的触发点。你与鬼魂的关系是什么？是否有某种程度的相互尊重？也许你的角色觉得自己更像是鬼魂的仆人，而不是相反，或者他们拥有支配和勒索精神生命的权利。",
	"How did your character come to be an adventurer? It could be that he or she was a pariah in their community due to contact with the other side, cast out and forced to fend for him or herself. Perhaps your character is even haunted by a particular spirit, and seeks away to control or be rid of it.": "你的角色是如何成为一名冒险家的？可能是他或她由于与另一方的接触而成为他们社区的异类，被驱逐出去，被迫自力更生。也许你的角色甚至被某个特定的精神所困扰，并寻求控制或摆脱它。",
	"You can make a witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, select the {@background Hermit} background. Third, select the {@spell chill touch}, {@spell guidance}, and {@spell light} cantrips.": "遵循这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名女巫。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质。第二，选择{@background Hermit}的背景。第三，选择{@spell chill touch}、{@spell guidance}和{@spell light}的咒语。",
	"In the presence of a spirit of Agony, foes' wounds continue to bleed and fires continue to burn. While Agony is bound, when you roll damage for an attack or spell you cast, for each 1 on a damage die, you can add the level of the spirit to the damage total.": "在痛苦之灵面前，敌人的伤口会继续流血，火焰会继续燃烧。当Agony被束缚时，当你为你施放的攻击或法术计算伤害时，每一个伤害模子上的1，你可以在伤害总数上加上精神的等级。",
	"You can release Agony as a reaction when you roll the highest possible number on a damage die. Roll a number of d6s equal to the spirit's level and add the total to the triggering damage as psychic damage.": "当你在一个伤害模子上掷出尽可能高的数字时，你可以作为反应释放痛苦。掷出与精神等级相等的d6数字，并将总数加到触发的伤害上作为精神伤害。",
	"Spirits of Desire impress your will onto others and enhance existing desires. Friendly and charmed creatures within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your spells. Once a creature succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against one of your spells, that creature is immune to this spirit's passive effect for 24 hours.": "欲望之灵将你的意愿传递给他人并增强现有的欲望。在你周围30英尺范围内的友好和被迷惑的生物在对你的法术进行智慧救赎时有劣势。一旦一个生物对你的一个法术的智慧救赎成功，这个生物就会在24小时内对这个精神的被动效果免疫。",
	"When you release this spirit as a bonus action, you attempt to charm a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be {@condition charmed} by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. The spirit's level determines what kind of creature can be charmed. At 3rd level and below, only humanoids and beasts are affected. At 4th level and above, all creatures can be affected.": "当你以额外行动释放这个精神时，你会试图迷惑你周围30英尺内你能看到的一个生物。目标必须对你的法术救赎DC进行智慧救赎成功，否则在1分钟内或在它受到伤害之前被你控制（%0%）。灵魂的等级决定了什么样的生物可以被魅惑。在3级及以下，只有人形生物和野兽受到影响。在第四级及以上，所有生物都能受到影响。",

Once on each of your turns, when you damage a creature with an attack or spell while Envy is bound, you regain a number of hit points equal to the level of the spirit.": "妒忌之灵从他人身上夺取他们所觊觎的东西--生命。在你的每个回合中，当你用攻击或法术伤害一个生物时，当妒忌之灵被束缚时，你会重新获得与该灵的等级相等的命中率。",

A blood witch might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit's service.
