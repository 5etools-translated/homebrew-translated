The moment she lets the arrow loose it bursts into flame and flies straight into the troll's eye.": "一个精灵给她的弓上了弦，等待着完美的攻击时机。她从她的野蛮表亲那里得到了灵感，她开始为她的箭注入元素能量。当她松开箭的那一刻，它迸发出火焰，直接飞向巨魔的眼睛。",
	"A dragonborn awakes with a start. His ally, the gnome who was currently on watch had let out a yell, announcing an ambush. Without a second thought, the reptilian warrior grabs his sword and shield and runs in front of the gnome in just his smallclothes. He'd gladly take a blow to save the life of a trusted ally. Before the Minotaur's axe can cleave into his skin, however, it's met by the brilliant plate armor that the dragonborn had left beside his bedroll.": "一个龙裔被惊醒了。他的盟友，也就是目前正在放哨的地精发出了一声吆喝，宣布了一场伏击。没有多想，这个爬行动物的战士抓起他的剑和盾牌，只穿着小衣服就跑到地精面前。他很乐意接受打击以拯救一个值得信赖的盟友的生命。然而，在牛头人的斧头劈进他的皮肤之前，它就被龙裔留在他的床铺旁的辉煌的板甲所迎接。",
	"The gnoll put down his spellbook, with a sigh. His partner had just run off in a blind rage. They would have to talk about this later. The gnoll set aside his spellbook onto the table and grabbed the shattered sword hilt next to it and ran out the door. The moment he passed through the threshold, fragments of metal materialise and fly onto the hilt, reconstructing the broken weapon as they go.": "地精放下了他的法术书，叹了口气。他的伙伴刚刚在盲目的愤怒中跑掉了。他们将不得不以后再谈这个问题。地精把法术书放在一旁的桌子上，抓起旁边破碎的剑柄就往门外跑。在他穿过门槛的那一刻，金属碎片化为实体，飞到剑柄上，一边飞一边重建这把破碎的武器。",
	"These warriors are known as Witch Knights. Students of schools both of sword and spell. Commonly mistaken for eldritch knights, these arcane warriors blend martial mastery and magical prowess like no other. While not as good at spellcraft as a wizard or at warfare as a fighter, they outclass either at their attempts to combine the two.": "这些战士被称为巫师骑士。他们都是剑术和法术学校的学生。通常被误认为是长老骑士，这些奥术战士将武术的精湛和魔法的强大融合在一起，别无他法。虽然不像巫师那样擅长法术，也不像战士那样擅长战争，但他们在试图将两者结合起来的过程中胜过任何一方。",

So attuned to the elements are the witch knights after training, that it comes to them as naturally as breathing.": "大多数施法者在战斗中使用咒语作为他们的面包和黄油，而女巫骑士则在他们的武器中注入元素魔法。经过训练的女巫骑士们对元素是如此的适应，以至于对他们来说就像呼吸一样自然。",
	"Witch knights are ready to call upon the elements at a moments notice but may also release them unconsciously, or in minor ways.

	"For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.": "对于每一级的咒语，这个过程需要2小时，花费50戈比。这笔费用代表了你在试验该咒语以掌握它时所消耗的材料成分，以及你记录它所需的精细墨水。一旦你花费了这些时间和金钱，你就可以像其他法术一样准备这个法术。",
	"You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook.

You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.": "你可以从自己的法术书中复制一个法术到另一本法术书中--例如，如果你想为你的法术书做一个备份。这就像把一个新的咒语复制到你的魔法书中一样，但是更快、更容易，因为你了解自己的记号，并且已经知道如何施法。你只需要花1个小时和10个金币来完成每一级的复制法术。",
	"If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

	"Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch knight spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的巫师骑士法术的施法能力，因为你通过专门的学习和训练来学习你的法术。每当法术提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的智力。此外，在设定你所施展的巫师骑士法术的蓄力DC时，以及在使用巫师骑士法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的智力修饰。",
