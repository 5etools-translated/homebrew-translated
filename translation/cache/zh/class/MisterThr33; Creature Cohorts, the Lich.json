You otherwise appear to be similar to the age you were before your transformation. ": "作为一个不死生物，你不再正常衰老，尽管你也没有永恒的青春。你的形态很可能是干瘪的，有着皮革般的肉体和斑驳的头发。除此之外，你看起来和你变身前的年龄差不多。",
	"Your tendency to lean towards good or evil likely has to do with how you became undead. If you decide to sacrifice the souls of others to become immortal (such as through the lich's Dread Lord subclass) then you are likely irredeemably evil, as the destruction of souls is one of the most profane acts known to the world.": "你的善恶倾向很可能与你成为亡灵的方式有关。如果你决定牺牲他人的灵魂来成为不死之身（比如通过巫妖的恐惧领主子类），那么你很可能是不可救药的邪恶，因为毁灭灵魂是世界上已知的最亵渎的行为之一。",
	"However, not all undead are evil by nature. In the plane of Eberron, the elves of Aerenal transform their most respected citizens into a type of radiant undead-- the Deathless-- who are generally good-aligned and opposed to other forms of undeath. Honored dead may wish to consider the lich subclass, the Transcendent.": "然而，并非所有的亡灵都是邪恶的。在Eberron位面，Aerenal的精灵们将他们最尊敬的公民转化为一种光芒四射的亡灵--无死亡者--他们通常都是善的，并反对其他形式的亡灵。尊敬的亡灵可以考虑巫师的子类--超凡者。",

Your skin may take on a deathly pallor, your eyes begin to gloss over or perhaps your hair becomes gray (if it does not fall out entirely).

You can use your innate magic to conceal these changes, though... for a time.": "如果你还不是亡灵，那么在1级时你的外表开始改变。你的皮肤可能呈现出死亡的苍白，你的眼睛开始变得有光泽，或者你的头发变得灰白（如果它没有完全脱落的话）。随着你的巫师等级的提高，你开始不再像一个活人，而更像一个真正的亡灵。你可以用你的先天魔法来掩盖这些变化，虽然......只是一段时间。",
	"As an action, you can make yourself appear as a younger (and very much living) version of yourself. This otherwise functions like the {@spell disguise self} spell. However, whenever a creature that had close knowledge of you before you became a lich (such a family member, a close colleague or long-time friend) comes within 30 feet of you and can see you, that creature can make an Insight check at the DM's discretion. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the creature succeeds on the check, they can see that you somehow look even better than they remember you-- which may be seen as a good thing, or just plain suspicious depending on how trusting the creature is. A dog that formerly loved you may suddenly think of you as a stranger, while a long time friend may find you more comely than ever before. In either case, they realize something is... different about you.": "作为一个行动，你可以让自己出现在一个年轻的（非常有活力的）版本。这与{@spell disguise self}法术的功能相同。然而，每当一个在你成为巫师之前对你有密切了解的生物（如家庭成员、亲密的同事或长期的朋友）来到你的30英尺范围内并能看到你时，该生物可以根据DM的判断做一个洞察力检查。判定值等于8+你的熟练度加成+你的智力修正值。如果该生物检查成功，他们可以看到你在某种程度上比他们记忆中的你看起来更好--这可能被视为一件好事，或者只是单纯的怀疑，取决于该生物的信任程度。一只以前很喜欢你的狗可能会突然把你当成一个陌生人，而一个多年的朋友可能会发现你比以前更有魅力。无论哪种情况，它们都会意识到你有些......不同。",

	"As a former wizard, you were accustomed to keeping your arcane knowledge in written form. Using a spellbook allowed you a great many options at your fingertips. However, your transformation into a lich has changed that somewhat. On the one hand, you now have intimate knowledge of many of your spells, such that you are no longer fully reliant on your spellbook. On the other hand, you quickly learn to adapt your spell repertoire as you go (see the Forbidden Lore ability, below). You might feel restricted in your spells known, at least initially. Over time, this will become less of an issue as your ability to adapt grows further.": "作为一个前巫师，你习惯于以书面形式保存你的奥术知识。使用法术书可以让你在指尖上拥有大量的选择。然而，你转变为巫师后，情况发生了一些变化。一方面，你现在对许多法术有了深入的了解，因此你不再完全依赖你的法术书。另一方面，你很快就能学会在你前进的过程中调整你的法术库（见下文的禁忌传说能力）。你可能会觉得你的法术知识受到限制，至少在最初。随着时间的推移，随着你适应能力的进一步增强，这将成为一个较小的问题。",

In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智力是你的巫师法术的施法能力，因为你通过近乎全面的奥术知识来学习你的法术。这可能是由于你独自升入巫师领域，通过多年的学习或通过与一个强大的魔鬼的安排。每当有咒语提到你的法术能力时，你就会使用你的智力。此外，在设定你所施展的巫师法术的蓄力DC时，以及在用巫师法术进行攻击时，你都会使用你的智力修改器。",

That creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll they make before the end of their next turn.": "在6级时，你可以在接触对手时将可怕的能量灌输给他们。作为你回合内的一个行动，你可以对一个触手可及的目标进行近战法术攻击，击中后造成{@dice 2d8}寒冷伤害。该生物在下一回合结束前所做的下一次攻击卷轴上有劣势。",
	"In addition, whenever you hit a creature with this ability, you may spend 2 lore points to force that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spellcasting save DC or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the paralysis effect on itself on a success. If a target is at half of their maximum hit points or fewer, they roll their saving throw with disadvantage.": "此外，每当你用这个能力击中一个生物时，你可以花费2个传说点来迫使该生物对你的法术保全DC进行宪法保全投掷，否则将被麻痹1分钟。被麻痹的生物可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对自己的麻痹效果。如果目标处于其最大命中率的一半或更少，他们将以劣势掷出他们的救赎。",
	"This ability's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 11th level ({@dice 3d8}) and 17th level ({@dice 4d8}).": "当你达到11级({@dice 3d8})和17级({@dice 4d8})时，这个能力的伤害增加1d8。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you learn to reach out to another's soul to create a brief, if disrupting bond between you and another creature. As an action during your turn, you target one creature you can see within 30 feet, forcing them to make a Charisma saving throw against your spellcasting save DC. On a failure, a crackling cord of negative energy tethers the target to you. You only take half damage (rounded down) from all sources while the bond is in place, and the target takes the remaining damage.": "从10级开始，你学会了接触另一个人的灵魂，在你和另一个生物之间建立一个短暂的、如果是破坏性的联系。在你的回合中，作为一个行动，你以30英尺范围内你能看到的一个生物为目标，迫使他们对你的法术救赎DC做出一个魅力救赎。如果失败，一根噼里啪啦的负能量绳索会将目标与你捆绑在一起。捆绑期间，你只承受来自所有来源的一半伤害（四舍五入），而目标则承受剩余的伤害。",
	"This ability lasts for 1 minute, or until you and the target become separated by more than 120 feet. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "这个能力持续1分钟，或者直到你和目标分开超过120英尺。目标可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对自己的影响。",
	"You may use this ability once, and recover any expended use upon completion of a long rest. If you have no uses remaining, you can continue to use this ability, but must expend 5 lore points and a 5th-level spell slot each time you choose to do so.": "你可以使用这个能力一次，并在完成长时间休息后恢复任何已消耗的使用。如果你没有剩余的使用次数，你可以继续使用这个能力，但每次选择这样做时必须消耗5点理论知识和一个5级法术槽。",
	"Starting at 13th level, you must sacrifice souls to power your phylactery. As long as your phylactery is intact and powered by another's soul (see the 'Your Phylactery' sidebar), you no longer have any need to fear death. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, killed or destroyed, your body crumbles to dust though your other equipment remains intact. You gain a new body in 1d4 days, regaining all your hit points and expended spell slots as though completing a long rest. Your new body appears without any equipment within 5 feet of your phylactery (or in the nearest unoccupied space).": "从13级开始，你必须牺牲灵魂为你的法器提供能量。只要你的法器完好无损，并由他人的灵魂提供能量（见 \"你的法器 \"侧栏），你就不再需要害怕死亡。如果你的命中率降至0，被杀或被毁，你的身体就会碎裂成灰，尽管你的其他装备仍然完好。你会在1d4天后获得一个新的身体，恢复你所有的命中率和消耗的法术槽，就像完成了一次长期的休息。你的新身体在你的法器周围5英尺内（或最近的无人空间）出现，没有任何装备。",
	"To sacrifice a soul, you must remain in contact with a stable (0 hit point) creature for 1 minute uninterrupted. You cannot take any other actions during this time, after which they make a Wisdom save against your spellcasting save DC. On a failed save, you extract their soul (killing them) and the soul whisks away to wherever your phylactery is located. You can only sacrifice a soul to your phylactery if it is on the same plane as yourself. The creature's soul may only escape if the phylactery is destroyed or if dispel magic is cast as a 9th level spell targeting the phylactery with their soul inside. If the soul is not freed within 24 hours of entering the phylactery, the soul becomes utterly consumed and nothing short of a greater deity's intervention can restore them.": "要牺牲一个灵魂，你必须与一个稳定的（0命中率）生物保持接触，持续1分钟不间断。在这段时间内你不能采取任何其他行动，之后他们会对你的法术救赎DC进行一次智慧救赎。如果救赎失败，你会提取他们的灵魂（杀死他们），然后灵魂会被呼啸着带到你的法器所在的地方。只有当灵魂与你同在一个平面上时，你才能将其献给你的法器。只有当法器被摧毁，或者当驱散魔法作为一个9级的法术被施放到装有他们灵魂的法器上时，该生物的灵魂才可能逃脱。如果灵魂在进入法器后的24小时内没有被释放，那么灵魂就会被彻底吞噬，没有任何东西可以让他们恢复，除非有更大的神灵介入。",
	"If your phylactery is destroyed and you are killed, your soul travels to the appropriate afterlife. Given the unmistakably evil act of consuming souls, you will most likely become the plaything of a powerful fiend. Recovering your soul from such a fate could require an adventure onto itself.": "如果你的法器被毁，你被杀，你的灵魂会前往相应的来世。鉴于吞噬灵魂的邪恶行为，你很可能会成为一个强大恶魔的玩物。从这样的命运中恢复你的灵魂，本身就需要一次冒险。",
	"In order to bind your soul to a new phylactery, you must craft a new device over 8 hours and bind it with the requisite magic. You must attune to the new phylactery as though it were a magical piece of equipment, and remain attuned to it with the item on your person for five days in succession. After such a time, your phylactery will be considered fully restored, and you no longer need to remain attuned to the item.": "为了将你的灵魂与新的法器结合起来，你必须在8小时内制作一个新的装置，并用必要的魔法将其绑定。你必须与新的法器相适应，就像它是一件神奇的装备一样，并且在你身上连续五天保持与它相适应。五天后，你的法器将被视为完全恢复，你不再需要保持对该物品的适应性。",
	"At 18th level, all of your soul is now contained in your phylactery. In order to maintain the device's power, however, you must continue to sacrifice the souls of others.": "在18级时，你所有的灵魂现在都包含在你的法器中。然而，为了维持这个装置的力量，你必须继续牺牲他人的灵魂。",
	"You learn the {@spell imprisonment} spell, which does not count towards your number of spells known. When casting {@spell imprisonment}, you can only choose one fate for your target-- trapping their body and soul into your phylactery, powering it as though sacrificing a soul normally. When you trap a soul in this way, you become rejuvenated. You immediately regain a number of hit points equal to half of your maximum (rounded up) and regain 9 lore points. You may only benefit from this effect once per day.": "你学会了{@spell imprisonment}的法术，这并不计入你已知的法术数量。在施展（1%）时，你只能为你的目标选择一种命运--将他们的身体和灵魂困在你的法器中，为它提供能量，就像正常地牺牲一个灵魂一样。当你以这种方式困住一个灵魂时，你就会恢复活力。你会立即恢复相当于你最大命中率一半的命中率（四舍五入），并恢复9点理论知识。你每天只能从这个效果中受益一次。",
	"You do not require any material components to cast {@spell imprisonment} in this way. If your phylactery is broken, casting the spell has no effect. If you are in demilich form (see the 'Your Phylactery' section), then you do not require any somatic components to cast the {@spell imprisonment} spell.": "你不需要任何材料成分就能以这种方式施展（%0%）。如果你的法器坏了，施法就没有效果。如果你是恶魔形态（见 \"你的法器 \"一节），那么你不需要任何体质成分来施展（%%）法术。",
	"To be buried with honors is, for most societies, a respectable goal in and of itself. Some peoples, though, have discovered ways to bestow the deceased with radiant energy. In this way, it is possible to sustain the champions of the world indefinitely-- to honor them not through death, but beyond it.": "对大多数社会来说，以荣誉下葬本身就是一个值得尊敬的目标。不过，有些民族已经发现了赋予死者以辐射性能量的方法。通过这种方式，有可能无限期地维持世界冠军的地位--不是通过死亡，而是超越死亡来纪念他们。",
	"The Deathless of Eberron are the most well-known example of this path, but the transcendent represents noble creatures as well as the neutral arbiters of the dead. Those who control radiant and necrotic energies to pursue perfection are best represented through the Rite of the Transcendent.": "Eberron的无死亡者是这条道路上最著名的例子，但超凡者也代表着高贵的生物以及中立的死亡仲裁者。那些控制辐射和坏死能量以追求完美的人，最好通过超凡者的仪式来体现。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, when completing a short rest, you may recover a number of expended spell slots up to a maximum of half of your lich level (rounded down). You may then choose a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 60 feet. Those creatures gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half of your lich level (rounded down).": "从2级开始，当完成一个短暂的休息时，你可以恢复一定数量的已消耗的法术槽，最多为你的巫师等级的一半（向下取整）。然后你可以在60英尺范围内选择一定数量的生物，最多为你的智力修饰值。这些生物获得相当于你巫师等级一半的临时命中率（向下取整）。",
	"Once you use this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.": "一旦你使用这个能力，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"At 6th level, whenever you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you may instead drop to 1 hit point. When you use this ability, you may choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you. Those creatures take 3d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) with no saving throw. You must choose the same damage type for all affected targets.": "在第6级时，每当你的命中率会降至0时，你可以转而降至1个命中率。当你使用这个能力时，你可以选择你周围30英尺内的一些生物。这些生物会受到3d6辐射或坏死的伤害（由你选择），并且没有救赎。你必须为所有受影响的目标选择相同的伤害类型。",
	"Your power over the forces of life and death reach new heights. You thrive off of the twilight energies in your environment, and can lace your spells with darkness or light.": "你对生命和死亡力量的力量达到新的高度。你依靠环境中的黄昏能量而茁壮成长，并能在你的法术中加入黑暗或光明。",
	"Starting at 10th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you may choose to convert half of that damage (rounded up) into radiant or necrotic damage. For example, using this ability while casting fireball would result in a fireball that deals either half fire, half radiant damage... or half fire, half necrotic damage.": "从10级开始，每当你施放一个造成伤害的法术时，你可以选择将该伤害的一半（四舍五入）转换成辐射或坏死伤害。例如，在施放火球术时使用这个能力会导致一个火球造成一半火，一半辐射伤害......或者一半火，一半坏死伤害。",
	"You may use this ability once per point of proficiency bonus, and may recover any expended use upon completion of a long rest. You may only use this ability once during the casting of a spell.": "你可以在每一点熟练度加成下使用这个能力一次，并且可以在完成长时间休息后恢复任何消耗的使用。你只能在施法过程中使用这个能力一次。",
	"In addition, whenever one or more creatures is reduced to 0 hit points or less within 60 feet of you, if radiant or necrotic damage was dealt to the creature as part of the killing blow (such as from a paladin's smite), then you may choose up to one creature within 60 feet of you. Both you and the chosen creature recover hit points equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus. You may only use this ability once per round.": "此外，每当一个或多个生物在你周围60英尺范围内被降低到0点或更低的命中率时，如果辐射或坏死伤害是作为致命一击的一部分对该生物造成的（例如来自圣骑士的击打），那么你可以选择你周围60英尺范围内最多一个生物。你和被选择的生物都会恢复相当于1d6+你的熟练度加成的打击点数。你每回合只能使用这个能力一次。",
	"At 13th level, if a spell, such as {@spell raise dead} has the sole effect of restoring you to life, the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.": "在13级时，如果一个法术，例如（%0%）具有使你恢复生命的唯一效果，施法者不需要物质成分来对你施法。",
	"In addition, you are always treated as though you are humanoid (rather than undead) for the purposes of spells that restore you to life. When you are revived, you always return in your undead form.": "此外，就恢复你生命的法术而言，你总是被视为类人（而非亡灵）。当你复活时，你总是以你的不死形态返回。",
	"Your body has become a true beacon of immortal power. Creatures that approach you cannot help but feel awed (or terrified) by what you represent. At 18th level, any creature who targets you with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This ability doesn't protect you from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.": "你的身体已经成为不朽力量的真正灯塔。接近你的生物会不由自主地对你所代表的东西感到敬畏（或惊恐）。在18级时，任何以你为攻击目标或有害法术的生物都必须首先对你的法术救赎DC进行智慧拯救。如果救赎失败，该生物必须选择一个新的目标，否则将失去攻击或施法的机会。这个能力并不能保护你不受区域效应的影响，例如火球的爆炸。",
	"If you make an attack or cast a spell that affects an enemy creature, that creature becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours.": "如果你的攻击或施法影响到敌方生物，该生物会在24小时内对该能力免疫。"
