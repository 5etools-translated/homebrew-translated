	"As an arrow leaves the bow of an orc and streaks towards a defenseless civilian, a hooded tabaxi leaps from the shadows. Throwing an axe with such speed only she can follow, the arrow suddenly splits in two, as it harmlessly falls at the cilivian's feet. The lone savior now stands face to face with the orc. She readies another axe, this one gleaming with energy.": "当一支箭离开兽人的弓，射向一个毫无防备的平民时，一个蒙面的塔巴西人从阴影中跃出。她以只有她能跟上的速度扔出一把斧头，箭突然分成两半，无害地落在西里夫人的脚下。孤独的救世主现在与兽人面对面地站着。她准备好另一把斧头，这把斧头闪着能量的光芒。",

	"Masters of the thrown weapon, marksmen excel at medium range. They utilize their accuracy and precision to control where their opponents are at any given time.

	"What really sets a marksman apart from other fighters is their research into the art of infusing spells into a weapon. While others can create magic items, or store spells in items for later use, marksmen have discovered a different approach. Their weapons act as a conduit for the magic, allowing it to travel from point A to point B. This is what makes them so versatile, as they are able to cast some spells in ways not even the most powerful wizard could.": "真正使神射手不同于其他战士的是他们对将法术注入武器的艺术的研究。当其他人可以创造魔法物品，或将法术储存在物品中供以后使用时，神射手发现了一种不同的方法。他们的武器作为魔法的管道，允许它从A点到B点。这就是他们如此多才多艺的原因，因为他们能够以连最强大的巫师都无法做到的方式施展一些法术。",
	"As you build your marksman, think about the kind of fighter they are. Are you someone who thinks about their surroundings?
