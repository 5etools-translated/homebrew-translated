	"A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and flames burst into a form taller than an ogre causing her enemies to flee. She holds up her spear and the flames pour from the roaring fire spirit to it, swirling about it, causing it to roar alight with searing magical flames.": "一个年轻的兽人发出一声怒吼，火焰迸发成一个比食人魔还高的形状，使她的敌人纷纷逃窜。她举起长矛，火焰从咆哮的火灵中涌向它，在它周围旋转，使它咆哮着燃起灼热的魔法火焰。",
	"The mysterious halfling woman gives a knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you've come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only in riddle.": "神秘的半身人妇女露出了会心的微笑，她那双看不见的眼睛注视着你。她知道你来的目的，并把一把香扔进火里；她在里面看到了什么？你的命运？你的命运？当她说话时，这只是一个谜语。",
	"Occultists are those that follow the old ways, a path of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it. They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that few fully understand, even those that use them, but they know it will work, for it always has.": "神秘主义者是那些遵循古老方式的人，这是一条早已为人所知却又经常被遗忘的仪式和智慧之路。他们不是强迫魔法服从，而是束缚、扭曲、操纵，并与之妥协。他们遵循古老的协议和技术，以产生很少有人完全理解的结果，即使是那些使用它们的人，但他们知道这将是有效的，因为它总是如此。",
	"Occultists are spell casters following legacies that go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or influence by another member of their tradition, their path to magic involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.": "隐修士是追随古老遗产的施法者。虽然他们可能会也可能不会直接受到其他传统成员的指导或影响，但他们的魔法之路涉及到发掘古老的秘密、古老的方法以及从灵魂、鬼魂和元素中收集的知识。",

	"Each tradition that appears in the Occultist is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story. Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their traditions, and they are often seen in this context.

	"A common thread of the magic wilded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the demi-divine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic oft through the intermediaries of the power of gods, spirits, elementals, and more. An Occultist is fundamentally tied into the greater magical world, being neither a source of magic nor an academic researcher of it, but wielding it through intuition, cunning, and tradition.": "奥术师所施展的魔法的一个共同点是它的精神联系；魔法的半神性，通过神、灵、元素等力量的中介，进入魔法的编织中。一个神秘主义者从根本上与更大的魔法世界联系在一起，他既不是魔法的来源，也不是魔法的学术研究者，而是通过直觉、狡猾和传统来挥舞它。",
	"Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects; the verbal component of an Occultist spell might be the spirit they call upon to work the effect they wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or words in a language that binds or persuades.": "通常情况下，奥术师可以通过精神媒介直接召唤他们的魔法，甚至为其召唤的精神命名，以实现某些魔法效果；奥术师咒语的语言成分可能是他们召唤的精神，以实现他们希望的效果，对他们古老的交易进行召唤，或者用一种语言来约束或劝说。",
	"When creating an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you follow. Each Tradition of an Occultist is distinct with divergent flavor and calling upon a different aspect of folklore. Do you embody the associations or defy them? What led you to this path? Did you uncover your tradition on your own or were you taught by another?": "当创建一个神秘主义者时，最重要的决定是你遵循什么传统。每个神秘主义者的传统都是与众不同的，具有不同的风味，并呼唤着民间传说的不同方面。你是体现协会还是藐视它们？是什么导致你走上这条道路？你是自己发现了你的传统，还是由别人教你的？",
	"You can make an Occultist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background hermit} background.

Your magic comes from a practitioners knowledge of traditional, ritual, and the way things work learned through experience, care and cunning.

Tough and powerful, they are most often found in the thick of the fight, wreathed in their primal power.": "萨满是一个行走在神灵之路上的神秘主义者，将它们与自己的事业结合起来，以增强自己的力量或给敌人带来灾难。他们坚韧而强大，最常在战斗中被发现，被他们的原始力量所笼罩。",

While the spirit is called and not manifested you gain temporary hit points equal to the level of the spell slot spent to empower at the start of each of your turns.": "从3级开始，当你召唤一个灵魂时，你会消耗一个1级或以上的法术槽来赋予该灵魂力量。一个被赋予力量的灵魂会给你的武器增加额外的伤害，并造成额外的显化伤害。当灵体被召唤而未被显现时，你会在每个回合开始时获得等同于为赋能而花费的法术槽等级的临时命中率。",
