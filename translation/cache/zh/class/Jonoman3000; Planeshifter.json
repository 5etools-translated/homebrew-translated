	"Clad in dark brown robes, a human unsheathes her sword and draws her hand back, whispering a quiet chant as undead creatures surround her. With a flick of her wrist, a bead of fire leaves her fingertips and streaks forward, erupting into a ball of fire once it reaches their ranks. As the flames disperse, she rushes into the fray with her blade, knocking aside the undead with deft strikes and precise blasts of water.": "一个身穿深棕色长袍的人类拔出了她的剑，把手缩了回来，在不死生物包围她的时候低声吟唱着。她手腕一抖，一颗火珠离开她的指尖，向前飞去，一旦到达他们的队伍，就会爆发成一个火球。当火焰消散时，她拿着刀冲进战场，用灵巧的打击和精确的水柱将亡灵打到一边。",
	"Her long hair whipped by conjured wind, a gnome leaps into the air. Momentarily floating above the battlefield, she soon crashes down into a mass of kobolds. As she lands, her skin becomes stonelike and an earthen shield surrounds her.": "她的长发被魔法风吹动，一个地精跃入空中。瞬间漂浮在战场之上，她很快就坠落到一群哥布林中。当她落地时，她的皮肤变得像石头一样，一个土质的盾牌围绕着她。",
	"Crouching on a high tree branch, a high elf draws back his bow. Focusing his gaze on the sleeping hill giant below, he releases an arrow. The fiery streak whistles as it flies towards its target, finding its mark in the back of the giant's head.": "蹲在高高的树枝上，一个高等精灵拉开了他的弓。他把目光集中在下面沉睡的山丘巨人身上，放出一支箭。火红的条纹呼啸着飞向它的目标，在巨人的后脑勺找到了它的目标。",
	"Planeshifters are masters of both arcane magic and the sword. Whatever their background, they are united by their study and mastery of the planes of existence. Drawing on the weaves of magic that permeate these planes, planeshifters cast spells of blazing fire, rushing wind, and even more powerful effects. Their traditions also stress the importance of physical strength and dexterity, as these traits are invaluable when traversing the highly varied and dangerous planar locations. Against some otherworldly creatures, an over-reliance on magic can spell a planeshifter's destruction.": "行星移位者是奥术魔法和剑的大师。无论他们的背景如何，他们都因研究和掌握存在平面而团结在一起。利用渗透在这些星球上的魔法织体，移行者施展出烈火、狂风，甚至更强大的法术。他们的传统也强调体力和灵巧的重要性，因为这些特征在穿越高度多样化和危险的星球时是无价的。在面对一些异世界的生物时，过度依赖魔法会给移居者带来毁灭。",
	"Alien and enigmatic, the otherworldly planes of existence draw the attention of many scholars and adventurers that seek to gain knowledge of their mysteries. The planes of existence teach of many things—while planes such as Elysium and Arcadia focus on magic, planes like Ysgard and Acheron seek out only mighty warriors. The halls teach that a planeshifter must learn from and study all the various planes, even if they specialize in only a few of them. Most planeshifters initially study and attune themselves to the elemental planes—the planes of fire, water, earth, and air, which allow them to learn elemental spells—but later they attune themselves to some of the many outer planes.": "陌生而神秘的另一个世界的存在平面吸引了许多学者和冒险家的注意，他们试图获得关于其神秘的知识。存在的星球教给人们许多东西--虽然像极乐世界和阿卡迪亚这样的星球专注于魔法，但像Ysgard和Acheron这样的星球只寻求强大的战士。殿堂教导说，一个移行者必须学习和研究所有不同的星球，即使他们只专注于其中的几个星球。大多数移行者最初学习并适应元素位面--火、水、土和空气位面，这使他们能够学习元素法术，但后来他们适应了许多外部位面。",
	"In order to harness planar magic, planeshifters must study the creatures of the planes they wish to attune to, and they also seek out and examine ancient relics and manuscripts that write of the planes of existence.": "为了驾驭平面魔法，移行者必须研究他们希望适应的平面的生物，他们也会寻找和检查记载存在平面的古老遗物和手稿。",
	"As the creatures of the multiverse are often dangerous, becoming a powerful planeshifter can be a deadly task. In their pursuit of knowledge, planeshifters often come across powerful elementals, genies, and an assortment of other extra-dimensional beings.": "由于多元宇宙的生物往往是危险的，成为一个强大的计划转移者可能是一项致命的任务。在追求知识的过程中，行星移位者经常会遇到强大的元素、精灵和其他各种各样的超维生物。",
	"A few ancient halls dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, acting as great schools of learning for prospective students. Much like the schools of wizardry, the halls of the planeshifters act like universities, teaching students of the powers of the multiverse and allowing them to research, and sometimes travel to the different planes of existence. These halls are usually quite large, though very few of their students are ever able to gain even apprentice level mastery of the planes.": "一些古老的大厅点缀在D&D世界的风景中，作为未来学生的伟大学习学校。与巫师学校一样，移行者的大厅就像大学一样，教授学生多元宇宙的力量，并允许他们进行研究，有时还可以前往不同的存在平面。这些大厅通常是相当大的，尽管他们的学生中很少有人能够获得甚至是学徒级别的星球掌握权。",
	"Planeshifter halls, like the planes themselves, have a dualistic nature. Any one hall often teaches only two of the major traditions, and they emphasize the importance of balance in all things—a planeshifter must learn of both the positive and negative planes, and they must balance their learning of both the martial and the arcane. A planeshifter that over-specializes is sure to find themselves unequipped to deal with the varied conditions of the planes.": "行星移位者大厅，就像星球本身一样，具有二元性质。任何一个殿堂通常只教两个主要的传统，他们强调平衡在所有事情中的重要性--移行者必须同时学习正面和负面的星球，他们必须平衡他们对武术和奥术的学习。一个过度专业的移行者肯定会发现自己没有能力处理各星球的不同情况。",
	"Planeshifters spend a lot of their time outside of the hall, however. The lure of knowledge or the rumors of an extraplanar object might call even prudent planeshifters to a life of adventure. If rumors of a particularly powerful or rare relic emerge, many planeshifters leave their halls on great adventures in their attempts to find it before others do.": "然而，移行者有很多时间是在大厅之外度过的。知识的诱惑或星外之物的传闻，甚至会召唤谨慎的移星者去冒险。如果出现了一个特别强大或罕见的遗物的传闻，许多移行者会离开他们的大厅，进行伟大的冒险，试图在其他人之前找到它。",
	"When you create a planeshifter, think about the history you have with your hall. Were you born there to parents that also learned or taught there? Did you enter the hall in order live a more secluded life, where you wouldn't be judged for your past deeds? Or perhaps you just chose this life on a whim?": "当你创建一个移形换影者时，想想你和你的大厅有什么历史。你是否出生在那里，父母也在那里学习或教学？你进入大厅是为了过一种更隐蔽的生活，在那里你不会因为你过去的行为而受到指责？或者你只是一时兴起选择了这种生活？",
	"You must also consider why you left the hall to adventure. Did you hear a particularly exciting rumor? Were you placed on a mission to recover a lost artifact or to seek out a an extraplanar being? Did you want to leave, or did you feel like you were pressured or even forced to go? Is there a secondary, personal quest that you wish to accomplish? Do you want to make this adventure quick so you can return to your studies, or do you want to go out and see the world?": "你还必须考虑你为什么离开大厅去冒险。你是否听到了一个特别令人兴奋的传言？你是被安排去找回丢失的文物，还是去寻找星外生物的任务？你是想离开，还是觉得有压力，甚至是被迫离开？是否有一个次要的、个人的任务是你希望完成的？你想让这次冒险快速完成，以便你能回到你的学习中去，还是你想出去看看这个世界？",
	"You can make a planeshifter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on what weapons you want to use. Your next highest ability score should be Intelligence, your spellcasting ability. Second, choose the sage background.": "按照这些建议，你可以快速地制造出一个平面变形器。首先，根据你想使用的武器，将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分。你的第二高能力分数应该是智力，也就是你的法术能力。第二，选择圣人背景。",
