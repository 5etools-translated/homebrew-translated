These constructs leave the cultivator with the ability to be adaptable to many situations.": "淇施放者以其取之不尽、用之不竭的弹药、远程和近距离作战能力而闻名。另一个值得注意的特点是他们的Ki构架技术。箭矢是由他们的环境灵气制成的，可以发挥一连串的多功能能力。这些构造使修炼者有能力适应许多情况。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, you learn to utilize your aura to create physical ammunition. As a part of each of your attacks, you may summon an arrow or bolt to attack with. This ammunition is magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and deals {@dice 2d4} force damage. This ammunition requires a ranged two-handed weapon to shoot. The ammunition's damage die increases to {@dice 2d6} at level 10. It dematerializes upon hitting or missing a target, and making one when another exists causes the older one to disappear, unless stated otherwise.": "从第三级开始，你学会了利用你的光环来创造物理弹药。作为你每次攻击的一部分，你可以召唤一支箭或闪电来攻击。这种弹药对于克服抵抗力来说是有魔力的，并造成{@dice 2d4}武力伤害。这种弹药需要用远程的双手武器来发射。弹药的伤害值在10级时增加到{@dice 2d6}。它在击中或错过目标后会消失，当另一个目标存在时，制造一个目标会使旧的目标消失，除非另有说明。",
	"Additionally, when you ready an attack, the ammunition does an extra {@dice 1d10} damage. It is lost if it is not shot by the end of your next turn, and the extra damage is wasted.": "此外，当你准备好攻击时，弹药会造成额外的（%0%）伤害。如果在你的下一回合结束时没有射出，它就会丢失，而且额外的伤害也被浪费了。",

	"This critical does not double the damage from Constructs.": "这个临界值不会使结构体的伤害加倍。",
	"Beginning at 11th level, your skill and talent at shooting lends you a deadly accuracy. Whenever you would roll damage for a summoned arrow, you may add your Intelligence modifier to that roll. If you do so while attacking without using a construct, you regain 1 ki point on a {@dice d20} roll of 10 or higher. This additional damage is doubled on a critical hit.": "从11级开始，你的射击技能和天赋使你具有致命的准确性。每当你要为召唤出来的箭滚动伤害时，你可以将你的智力修饰值加到该滚动上。如果你在不使用构装体的情况下这样做，你在掷出10或更高的{@dice d20}骰子时可以恢复1点智力。这个额外的伤害在关键打击时是双倍的。",

	"Starting at 15th level, you've become a spell caster's bane. As a reactoin, when an enemy within your weapon's first range casts a spell, you may make a ranged attack roll against them. This attack cannot be made at advantage.

On a fail, the spell fails, and the slot is wasted. You may do this twice per long rest.": "从15级开始，你已经成为施法者的克星。作为一个反应因素，当你的武器第一范围内的敌人施放法术时，你可以对他们进行一次范围攻击卷。这种攻击不能以优势进行。如果攻击命中，你不会造成任何伤害，但敌人必须做一个注意力集中的救赎，就像它在集中施放一个DC等于你的培养者救赎DC的法术。如果失败，法术就会失败，而且这个位置会被浪费掉。你可以在每个长时区做两次这个动作。",
	"This technique is taught to those who excel at meditative introspection. This is due to the required ability to find a soul space with which to house the weapons that will become your soul arms. The users of this technique will find themselves turned into whirlwinds of blades, storms of strikes, and never without a weapon.": "这项技术是教给那些擅长冥想内省的人的。这是因为需要找到一个灵魂空间，用来放置将成为你灵魂武器的武器。这种技术的使用者会发现自己变成了刀剑的旋风，打击的风暴，而且永远不会没有武器。",

	"You can attune to magic and non magical weapons by meditating while you hold the weapon. You must meditate this way over the course of a long rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into a space formed in your core, and it appears whenever you take your stance thereafter. The weapons appear at your feet if you die, meditate over a different weapon that would replace one, or if you use a long rest to end the attunement. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in your space when the bond breaks.": "你可以通过在持有武器时进行冥想来调整魔法和非魔法武器。你必须在长时间的休息过程中进行这样的冥想。然后你可以解除武器，把它分流到你的核心中形成的空间，此后只要你摆好姿势，它就会出现。如果你死了，对一个不同的武器进行冥想以取代一个武器，或者你用一个长时间的休息来结束调和，那么武器会出现在你的脚下。如果在纽带断裂时，武器在你的空间里，它就会出现在你的脚下。",
