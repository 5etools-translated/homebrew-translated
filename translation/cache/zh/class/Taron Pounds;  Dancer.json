	"As a knight swings wide trying to strike the frothing maw of a displacer beast, a tiefling moves across the cave in a display of confidence and beauty. The mere sight of her invigorates the knight with an inner fire, who musters the strength to raise their sword up once more. The beast's deafening roar is silenced, as the blade is plunged deep past its fangs, seconds before those same fangs would have buried themselves within the knight's neck.": "当一个骑士挥舞着大刀，试图击打一个流离失所的野兽的大嘴时，一个铁皮人在山洞里走来走去，表现出自信和美丽。仅仅是看到她，就能让骑士的内心为之振奋，他鼓起力量再次举起剑来。野兽震耳欲聋的吼叫声被压制住了，因为剑刃深深地插进了它的獠牙，在这些獠牙埋进骑士的脖子之前几秒钟。",
	"An archmage opens his flame-wreathed hands, sending bolts of fire directly towards the party. Interceding, a human guides the flames through the air, flinging them back at the archmage, giving him a taste of his own medicine.": "一个大法师张开他的火焰之手，将火球直接射向对方。一个人类插手，引导火焰穿过空气，把它们扔回给大法师，让他尝尝自己的药。",

	"Preservers and pioneers of dance traditions, dancers are practitioners of the alluring and, at times, distracting art of dance. They have a remarkable flair for drawing the attention of others, allowing these awe-inspiring muses to turn the tide of any engagement.": "舞蹈家是舞蹈传统的保护者和开拓者，他们是诱人的，有时也是分散注意力的舞蹈艺术的实践者。他们具有吸引他人注意力的非凡天赋，使这些令人敬畏的缪斯女神能够在任何活动中扭转局势。",
	"Anything created that elicits an emotional response can be considered art. Writers pen the story, musicians compose the song, painters color the landscape, but dancers simply dance. It is the only art form in which the performer is the entirety of the artistic medium, putting themselves on display for their passion. They are mavens of distraction, for no person is truly more at-home as the center of attention than a dancer.": "任何能引起情感反应的创作都可以被认为是艺术。作家写故事，音乐家作曲，画家给风景上色，但舞蹈家只是跳舞。这是唯一的艺术形式，表演者是艺术媒介的全部，为了他们的激情而把自己展示出来。他们是分散注意力的高手，因为没有人比舞者更容易成为注意力的中心。",

	"Drawing the comparison between a bard and a dancer is inevitable; but the two are compliments, not competitors. While bards actualize their magic by performing or reciting tones of power, the dancer uses beautiful dance flares to externalize and influence emotion.

Anyone can dance, but few can claim to have gone through the practice, study, then application of this art form that makes one a dancer.": "将吟游诗人和舞者进行比较是不可避免的；但这两者是一种恭维，而不是竞争。吟游诗人通过表演或背诵力量的音调来实现他们的魔法，而舞者则用美丽的舞蹈信号来外化和影响情感。两者分别工作，但又相互配合，因为吟游诗人的音乐装饰了时间，而舞者的美丽装饰了空间。任何人都可以跳舞，但很少有人能声称自己经历了这种艺术形式的练习、研究和应用，从而成为一名舞者。",

Did you formerly belong to a troupe or traveling act? Do you think touring with your band of bodyguards is the best means of enhancing your star power? It's questions like these that can help shape your reasons for adventuring as a dancer.": "舞蹈是一种受人喜爱的娱乐形式，对于一个舞者来说，在任何城市都不难找到一个相当舒适的生活环境。为什么你要选择巡回演出的生活，而不是继续在当地演出？你是在寻求名声，还是希望在建立自己的名声后过上隐居的生活？你以前是属于一个剧团或巡回演出吗？你认为和你的保镖团一起巡回演出是提高你的明星效应的最佳手段吗？诸如此类的问题可以帮助形成你作为一个舞蹈家冒险的理由。",

	"Masters of blade, spear, whip, and staff, Dancers of this Choreo blend artistic grace and martial prowess to put on breathtaking displays that are as beautiful as they are deadly. Their performances call for more than just raw strength or speed, but precision and control of both one's weapon and body, with Dancers often showing how well they can dodge a weapon as well as wield one. Devoting one's self to the study of this Choreo is not for the faint of heart, as this style calls for the Dancer to take center stage and put one's life on the line, both in performance and in combat. Some consider this Choreo to be the counterpart to a certain Bardic College, though most practitioners of this Choreo are quick to dismiss such comparisons, typically remarking that Bards rely too heavily on magic to awe and captivate a crowd, whereas Dancers rely purely on their own skill and ability.": "刀、矛、鞭、杖的大师，这个舞蹈团的舞者将艺术的优雅和武术的高超融合在一起，进行令人惊叹的表演，既美丽又致命。他们的表演要求的不仅仅是原始的力量或速度，而是对武器和身体的精确和控制，舞者经常展示他们如何很好地躲避武器以及挥舞武器。献身于这种舞蹈的研究，并不适合胆小的人，因为这种风格要求舞者站在舞台中央，把自己的生命置于危险之中，无论是在表演还是在战斗中。有些人认为这种舞蹈是与某个吟游诗人学院相对应的，但这种舞蹈的大多数练习者很快就否定了这种比较，他们通常会说吟游诗人过于依赖魔法来敬畏和吸引人群，而舞者则纯粹依靠自己的技巧和能力。",

	"Some are born destined for fame, others work their fingers to the bone daily to achieve it, some are just in the right place at the right time, and from these individuals the Choreo of the Idolized Superstar was born. Ever the center of public attention, most students of this Choreo live in the public's eye, soaking in the adulation of their adoring fans. Once famous, some take to adopting a secret persona or alter ego, so they may go about the more mundane aspects of their life without being mobbed by crowds.Typically found in large metropolitan cities with the largest potential fanbases, Dancers that study this Choreo often work closely with merchants, using their fame to popularize products for the right price. Fame, however, is a double edged sword, and can quickly turn to infamy in the span of one public faux pas. Though this may cost them their mainstream appeal, these fallen idols can still become icons of counterculture, for as a wise man once said, 'Once you're famous you can become infamous, but you can never become un-famous'.": "有些人生来就注定要成名，有些人每天都在为成名而努力，有些人只是在正确的时间出现在正确的地点，从这些人中诞生了偶像化超级明星合唱团。这个合唱团的大多数学生一直是公众关注的焦点，他们生活在公众的视线中，沉浸在崇拜他们的粉丝的崇拜中。一旦成名，有些人就会采用一个秘密的角色或另一个自我，这样他们就可以在生活中更平凡的方面不被人群围观。然而，名气是一把双刃剑，在一次公开的失误中就能迅速转变成臭名昭著。虽然这可能会使他们失去主流吸引力，但这些堕落的偶像仍然可以成为反文化的标志，因为正如一位智者曾经说过的，\"一旦你出名，你可以变得臭名昭著，但你永远不可能变得不出名\"。",

	"Lavish parties among the aristocracy are essentially a rite of passage for members of nobility, as politics unfold in the ballroom as often as they do in the war room. The Choreo of The Court adopts the traditions and mannerisms of nobility. Even if these dancers cannot claim the pedigree of noble birth, they are learned in the practices and pomp of patricians; be it from rubbing elbows with those of royal hierarchy or from instructing members of ruling families in this style. Sometimes seen as entitled and elitist, such behavior can hardly be considered out of place for one who is used to living in the lap of luxury. This high standard is not just applied to others however, as masters of this Choreo strive for nothing short of perfection in their every action, conducting themselves with a calculated tact and suave that allows them to navigate even the most treacherous of social environments as easily as they could a dance floor.": "贵族中的豪华宴会基本上是贵族成员的一种仪式，因为政治在舞厅中的展开与在作战室中的展开一样频繁。宫廷舞蹈团采用了贵族的传统和举止。即使这些舞者不能声称有贵族血统，他们也学会了贵族的做法和盛况；无论是从与皇室等级的人打交道，还是从指导统治家庭的成员学习这种风格。有时被视为有权和精英主义，但对于一个习惯于生活在奢华中的人来说，这种行为很难被认为是不合适的。然而，这种高标准并不仅仅适用于其他人，因为这种舞蹈的大师们在他们的每一个行动中都力求完美，以一种精心策划的策略和风度来进行自己，使他们能够像在舞池中一样轻松地驾驭最危险的社会环境。",
