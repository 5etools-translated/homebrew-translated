	"A human clad in gleaming plate armour stares down a snarling owlbear, slowly reaching for the lance strapped across her back. The owlbear charges before she can reach her weapon, but a gout of fire from the sky stops the owlbear in its tracks. The gold dragon lands in front of the human, its eyes burning with a fiery vengeance as it snorts, causing flames to billow from its nostrils. Mounting her dragon, the human lets out a war cry as the dragon takes off into the air.": "一个身穿闪亮板甲的人类盯着一只咆哮的猫头鹰，慢慢地伸手去拿绑在她背上的长矛。在她拿到武器之前，猫头鹰就冲了过来，但天空中的一道火光让猫头鹰停下了脚步。金龙降落在人类面前，它的眼睛燃烧着炽热的复仇之火，它打着喷嚏，使火焰从它的鼻孔中喷出。人类骑上她的龙，在龙腾空而起时发出了战吼。",
	"Pulling the bowstring back, the elf whispers a few hushed words as an arcane fire erupts around the goblins below. Lightning sparks at the tip of his arrow, and he grins to himself as he fires at the goblin chief. The arrow finding its mark, the goblin chief can barely cry for help as lightning explodes from his body, arcing off to his nearby guards. In the trees, a nearby blue dragon chuckles to itself as it descends upon those left.": "拉开弓弦，精灵低声说了几句，下面的地精周围爆发出一道弧形的火焰。闪电在他的箭尖上闪烁，他一边向地精首领射击，一边自嘲地笑着。箭找到了它的目标，地精首领几乎无法呼救，因为闪电从他的身体里爆发出来，向他附近的卫兵划去。在树上，一条附近的蓝龙自嘲地笑了笑，它向剩下的人走去。",
	"The platinum dragon sniffs at some rubble before nudging it, looking back towards a halfling. She comes over and together they shift the rocks. Reaching her hand out, the halfling brushes the hair out of the eyes of the small boy who lies in the rubble. A shield of divine magic wraps around his small frame as the halfling pulls him into her arms, carrying him to safety.": "铂金龙嗅了嗅一些碎石，然后点了点它，回头看向一个半身人。她走过来，他们一起移开了石头。半身人伸出手来，把躺在瓦砾中的小男孩的头发从眼睛上拂去。当半身人把他拉到她的怀里，把他带到安全的地方时，一个神圣的魔法盾牌包裹着他的小身板。",
	"Scowling to himself, the half-orc looks around the darkened cave for his quarry. Letting out a short whistle, a dark dragon, onyx in colour, seems to appear from the shadows with a dead drow in its maw. Rolling his eyes, the half-orc makes a motion with his hands, and the dragon spits out the drow, a sheepish expression on its reptilian face as darkness begins to swirl around the pair, causing them to vanish.": "半兽人皱着眉头，在黑暗的山洞里寻找他的猎物。发出一声短哨，一条黑玛瑙色的龙似乎从阴影中出现，嘴里叼着一个死乌鸦。半兽人揉了揉眼睛，用手做了一个动作，龙吐出了乌鸦，它的爬行动物脸上露出了羞涩的表情，黑暗开始在这对夫妇周围旋转，使他们消失了。",
	"While different in personality and fighting styles, all of these heroes are dragon knights, a champion who fights alongside a dragon companion. Tough, relentless and unyielding, dragon knights and their dragons never give up, fighting to either heroic or devious ends.": "虽然性格和战斗风格不同，但所有这些英雄都是龙骑士，一个与龙伙伴一起战斗的冠军。坚韧、无情、不屈，龙骑士和他们的龙从不放弃，为英雄或邪恶的目的而战。",
	"The bond between a knight and their dragon is nearly impossible to eclipse. Only powerful magic can even attempt to turn them against one another, and they nearly never fight each other against their own will. Despite this, a knight and their dragon are known to argue over strategy, tactics, or even miscellaneous things, as the dragon, despite its respect for its knight, is not quick to let go of its ego.": "骑士和他们的龙之间的联系几乎是不可能被削弱的。只有强大的魔法才能使他们彼此反目，他们几乎从不违背自己的意愿相互争斗。尽管如此，骑士和他们的龙还是会因为战略、战术，甚至是一些杂七杂八的事情而争论不休，因为龙尽管尊重它的骑士，但却不会很快放下它的自我。",
	"As the knight and dragon grow together, this bond strengthens, granting both the knight and dragon impressive strength and unique powers. The dragon is typically the stronger of the pair as they develop, but will be weaker earlier on, while the knight still has to watch over them to ensure their bond can continue to flourish. Eventually, some knights might put down their weapons and live a simple life with their dragon, having forged a legendary friendship through the trials they faced.": "随着骑士和龙的共同成长，这种纽带会得到加强，赋予骑士和龙令人印象深刻的力量和独特的能力。在发展过程中，龙通常是一对中比较强壮的，但在早期会比较弱，而骑士仍然要看管它们，以确保它们的关系能够继续发展。最终，一些骑士可能会放下武器，与他们的龙过着简单的生活，通过他们所面临的考验，建立起传奇般的友谊。",
	"This connection has its drawbacks, however, and should the knight fall in battle, the dragon too will die, as the dragon's spirit can't live without the knight. Should the dragon fall in battle, the knight can restore its body with a costly ritual, but a few knights might instead choose to let their dragons rest, and go on to instead simply channel their dragon's power.": "然而，这种联系也有其缺点，如果骑士在战斗中倒下，龙也会死去，因为龙的精神不能没有骑士的陪伴。如果龙在战斗中倒下，骑士可以通过昂贵的仪式来恢复它的身体，但有一些骑士可能会选择让他们的龙休息，而去简单地引导他们的龙的力量。",
	"All dragon knights are divided by their practice, and much like the dragons they raise and fight with, the knights are known to be proud at their best, and egotistical at their worst. Two people of different practices are rarely able to get along, despite how similar they might be. Those of the Platinum Practice always regard themselves superior to those of the Shadow Practice, and members of the Elemental Practice consider the members of the Rider Practice to be brutish and dim-witted.": "所有的龙骑士都是以他们的修行方式来划分的，就像他们养的龙和与之战斗的龙一样，骑士们最好的时候是以骄傲著称，最坏的时候是以自负著称。不同修行的两个人很少能够相处，尽管他们可能有多么相似。铂金修行者总是认为自己比影子修行者高明，而元素修行者认为骑士修行者是野蛮和愚笨的。",
	"Despite these rivalries, dragon knights are fiercely loyal, and will never betray another dragon knight, even if they come from a different practice. Dragon knights believe they only have each other to count on, as no one else understands the intense bond between the knight and the dragon.": "尽管有这些竞争，但龙骑士是非常忠诚的，他们永远不会背叛另一个龙骑士，即使他们来自不同的实践。龙骑士们相信他们只有彼此可以依靠，因为没有人理解骑士和龙之间的强烈联系。",
	"When creating your dragon knight, there's one question you should consider before all others; how did you get your dragon? Did you find an egg, and manage to form a bond with the hatchling? Was it a gift from an ancient dragon, looking for someone to protect its young? Did it declare you as its knight one day, much to your surprise?": "在创建你的龙骑士时，有一个问题你应该先考虑，你是怎么得到你的龙的？你是否找到了一个蛋，并设法与孵化的小龙形成了联系？它是一个古老的龙的礼物，正在寻找一个人保护它的孩子吗？它是否有一天宣布你是它的骑士，这让你很惊讶？",
	"All dragon knights go through the bonding ceremony, which is where they form a close bond with their dragon, establishing each other as allies and protectors. Was your dragon willing in this ceremony, or was it raised to serve you? Or did your dragon actually perform the ceremony, and you had absolutely no clue as to what was going on?": "所有的龙骑士都要经历结合仪式，在这个仪式上，他们与他们的龙形成紧密的联系，建立彼此的盟友和保护者。你的龙在这个仪式中是自愿的，还是被养来为你服务的？或者你的龙实际上是在进行这个仪式，而你完全不知道发生了什么？",
	"Something else you must consider is your character's martial abilities. All dragon knights are skilled in combat, and how your character is too is something that will need to be considered. Perhaps they where a student at a military academy, or a guard-in-training at their home village?": "其他你必须考虑的是你的角色的武术能力。所有的龙骑士都擅长战斗，而你的角色如何也是需要考虑的问题。也许他们是军事学院的学生，或者是在家乡受训的警卫？",
	"You can make a dragon knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, make either Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on the type of weapons you want to use. Your next highest ability score should be Constitution if you plan to focus on melee combat, or Charisma if you want to improve your overall subclass features. Second, choose the Folk Hero background.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快地做出一个龙骑士。首先，根据你想使用的武器类型，将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分。如果你打算专注于近战，你的下一个最高能力得分应该是体质，如果你想提高你的整体亚类特征，则应该是魅力。第二，选择民间英雄的背景。",
	"Each dragon knight has a different story to tell when it comes to how they met their dragon. The way a dragon and knight first meet often set up how they interact for the rest of their lives, and a bad first impression can prove disastrous to their bond.": "每位龙骑士都有一个不同的故事，说到他们是如何遇到他们的龙的。龙和骑士第一次见面的方式往往决定了他们余生的互动方式，而糟糕的第一印象会对他们的关系造成灾难性的影响。",
	"When you consider the creation of this covenant, also consider the following: were you and your dragon both willing, and does your character ever regret the bond?": "当你考虑建立这个盟约时，也要考虑以下问题：你和你的龙都是自愿的，你的角色是否曾为这个纽带感到后悔？",

	"Forced to bond with your dragon, it acts as a guardian and a protector, despite how much you insist you don't need its help.": "被迫与你的龙结合，它就像一个监护人和保护者，尽管你多么坚持你不需要它的帮助。",
	"Trading a large amount of treasure for a dragon's egg, you raised the dragon to serve as your mount and companion.": "用大量的财宝换取了一颗龙蛋，你把龙养大，作为你的坐骑和伙伴。",
	"The nature of the relationship between dragon and knight varies between each dragon knight, and changes the way each knight and dragon interact with each other, and those around them. This relationship is based on their covenant, ideals, flaws, and personality traits.": "龙和骑士之间关系的性质因每个龙骑士而异，并改变了每个骑士和龙之间的互动方式，以及他们周围的人。这种关系是基于他们的盟约、理想、缺陷和人格特征。",
	"While you decide on your relationship, consider how it will effect the way you and your dragon fight together.": "当你决定你的关系时，考虑它将如何影响你和你的龙一起战斗的方式。",
	"Best friends can't even begin to describe you and your dragon, and you do absolutely everything together.": "最好的朋友甚至不能用来描述你和你的龙，你们绝对是一起做所有事情。",

	"Finally, having a draconic companion is not without its complications. Somewhere in your travels, your and your companion may have caused fear among travelers or gained the ire of a noble court. This obstacle might determine complications that arise in your adventures.": "最后，拥有一个龙人的同伴并非没有麻烦。在你旅行的某个地方，你和你的同伴可能会在旅行者中引起恐惧，或者获得贵族法庭的愤怒。这个障碍可能会决定你的冒险中出现的复杂情况。",
