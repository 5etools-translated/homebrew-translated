	"The Pallid half-elf mutters an incantation under his breath, and his shadow comes alive, taking the form of a massive wolf. At his command the wolf pounces on his attacker, a foolish bandit, knocking him to the ground. The half-elf chants another incantation, and as pulsing green orbs of acidic energy forms in his hands as the bandit struggles in vain against the massive shadow-beast. The bandit lets out a piercing scream, filled with regret, as the two spheres of acidic energy fly towards him.": "苍白的半精灵在口中喃喃自语，他的影子活了过来，变成了一只巨大的狼的形状。在他的命令下，狼扑向他的攻击者，一个愚蠢的强盗，把他打倒在地。半精灵又念起了咒语，当强盗在巨大的阴影兽面前徒劳地挣扎时，他的手中形成了脉冲式的绿色酸性能量球。当两个酸性能量球向他飞去时，强盗发出了一声刺耳的尖叫，充满了遗憾。",
	"As the grass and trees smolder from the great dragon's fiery blast, the smoke clears to reveal a young man. His clothes burned away to reveal patches of golden scales. His eyes flash a fierce gold, and white jets of flame burst from his fingertips. The dragon reels from the impact, crashing into the dirt. He had underestimated this mortal, how had he come to wield power rivaling a dragon?": "当草木被大龙的火光烧得冒烟时，烟雾散去，露出一个年轻人。他的衣服被烧掉了，露出了成片的金色鳞片。他的眼睛闪烁着凶猛的金色，白色的火焰喷射从他的指尖迸发出来。龙从冲击中回过神来，撞上了泥土。他低估了这个凡人，他怎么会拥有与龙匹敌的力量？",
	"The young halfling girl ducked into an alleyway, quickly hiding the stolen loaf of bread under her cloak. Back in the market she had come from, chaos had broken out. She had attempted a simple enchantment, just enough to convince the baker to give her a loaf of bread for free, but her magic had other plans. As she whispered to the baker, a crack - like a bolt of lightning - could be heard throughout the market, and suddenly all the produce in the square spoiled. She cursed this power that caused her parents to abandon her to the streets. If she could only control this power she could do much to ease the suffering of other urchins like herself.": "年轻的半身人女孩躲进一条小巷，迅速将偷来的面包藏在斗篷下。在她来的那个市场里，已经发生了混乱。她尝试了一个简单的魔法，只够说服面包师免费给她一条面包，但她的魔法有其他计划。当她对面包师低语时，整个市场都能听到一道裂缝--就像一道闪电，突然间，广场上所有的产品都变质了。她诅咒这种导致她的父母将她抛弃在街头的力量。如果她能控制这种力量，她可以做很多事情来减轻像她一样的其他顽童的痛苦。",
	"Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.": "巫师在这个世界上是很罕见的，不以某种方式参与冒险生活的巫师是不常见的。血管里涌动着魔法力量的人很快就会发现，这种力量并不喜欢保持安静。巫师的魔法想要被挥舞，如果不被召唤，它就会以不可预知的方式溢出来。",
	"Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.": "巫师们常常有晦涩难懂的动机，驱使他们去冒险。有些人寻求对注入他们体内的魔法力量有更多的了解，或对其起源之谜的答案。其他人则希望找到摆脱它的方法，或释放其全部潜力。无论他们的目标是什么，巫师对冒险队伍来说都和巫师一样有用，他们在使用他们所知道的法术时具有巨大的灵活性，从而弥补了他们在魔法知识方面相对缺乏的广度。",
	"Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of powerful beings or elemental energies. Others carry a raw uncontrolled magic within them, chaotic storms that manifest in unexpected ways.": "魔法是每个巫师的一部分，它使身体、思想和精神充满了潜在的力量，等待着被挖掘。一些巫师挥舞着来自古老血脉的魔法，注入了强大的生命或元素能量的魔法。另一些人则携带着原始的、不受控制的魔法，混乱的风暴以意想不到的方式表现出来。",
	"The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some arcane bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a celestial, the blessing of a djinni at birth, or the taste of water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.": "巫术力量的出现是非常难以预料的。有些神秘的血统每一代都会产生一个巫师，但在其他血统中，每个人都是巫师。大多数时候，巫术的天赋是以明显的侥幸心理出现的。一些巫师无法说出他们力量的来源，而其他巫师则将其追溯到他们自己生活中的奇怪事件。天人的触摸，出生时精灵的祝福，或者神秘泉水的味道，都可能激发出巫术的天赋。魔法之神的天赋也可能是如此，接触到内部星球的元素力量或Limbo的疯狂混乱，或者瞥见了现实的内部运作。",
	"Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power.": "巫师不需要巫师所依赖的法术书和古老的魔法传说书，他们也不像术士那样依赖赞助人授予他们法术。通过学习驾驭和引导自己与生俱来的魔力，他们可以发现新的、令人震惊的方法来释放自己的力量。",
	"The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose a sorcerous origin from the options detailed in the class description, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?": "在创建你的巫师时要考虑的最重要的问题是你力量的来源。作为一个起始角色，你将从等级描述中详述的选项中选择一个巫术起源，但你的力量的确切来源由你决定。它是一个家族的诅咒，从遥远的祖先传给你的？或者是一些特殊的事件让你得到了固有的魔法，但也许也留下了伤痕？",
	"You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Charisma your highest ability score followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background hermit} background.
