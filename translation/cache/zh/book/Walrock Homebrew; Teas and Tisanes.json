	"While adventurers are often famed for delving into dangerous places and retrieving fabled treasures, many find solace in other pursuits, from creating art to crafting culinary masterpieces.

	"Included here is an option for a new set of artisan's tools, the tea set, along with teas that can be brewed by using the tea set.

	"The process of brewing tea takes about an hour, and can be done over a short rest. This can take many forms, from a simple kettle bubbling over a campfire to an elaborate tea ceremony full of etiquette and tradition.

	"Drinking a serving of tea is either done over the course of one minute or one hour for maximum enjoyment, or with the Use an Object action if a creature is too rushed to actually savor the beverage. Unless it is cold tea, drinking tea with the Use an Object action inflicts 1 fire damage from hastily consuming a scalding beverage.": "喝茶可以在一分钟或一小时内完成，以获得最大的乐趣；如果生物太过匆忙而无法真正品尝到饮料，则可以使用 \"使用物品 \"行动。除非是冷茶，否则用 \"使用物品 \"动作喝茶会因为匆忙饮用滚烫的饮料而造成1点火伤。",
