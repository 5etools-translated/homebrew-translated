	"{@b The playing board}: Trollbones is played on a square board, commonly made of wood and divided in eight triangular sections.

	"{@b The rules}: Players take 3 turns, one at a time, moving clockwise around the board. Each turn is made up of 3 throws in which players take their 4 \"bones\" and let them drop onto the playing board from a hand-height. Players hold the bones at least 6\" above the board and drop them, attempting to land the ends onto the marked spaces. The results are added up for the total score that turn. For example: a bone has one end touching the number 1, the other touching the number 4, making a score of 5. Both ends of the bone must rest on a number or specific symbol in order to score points. If one of the ends lands on a moon symbol and the other on a number, the score of that throw is doubled. If one of the ends lands on a sun symbol, the throw results in a score of zero regardless of the other bones' result, suggesting the sun has turned the troll bones into stone.": "{@b The rules}: 玩家进行3个回合，每次一个，顺时针绕着棋盘移动。每一回合由3次投掷组成，玩家拿着自己的4根 \"骨头\"，让它们从手的高度落到棋盘上。玩家拿着骨头在棋盘上方至少6英寸处投掷，试图将骨头的两端落在标记的空格内。结果加起来就是该轮的总分。例如：一根骨头的一端接触到数字1，另一端接触到数字4，得分是5。骨头的两端必须放在数字或特定符号上才能得分。如果其中一端落在月亮符号上，另一端落在数字上，则该次投掷的分数会翻倍。如果其中一端落在太阳符号上，无论其他骨头的结果如何，投掷的结果都是零分，这说明太阳把巨魔的骨头变成了石头。",
	"{@b Winning}: Each player has 3 throws per turn, before continuing to the next player. When all turns have finished, scores are totaled. The player with the highest score wins.": "{@b Winning}: 每个玩家每回合有3次投掷机会，然后继续下一个玩家。当所有回合结束后，分数会被计算出来。得分最高的玩家获胜。",

	"{@b The playing board}: The game is played on a board divided in two halves, each made up of 18 squares with a row of 6 squares running across the middle. Six four-sided dice rest on this middle row, which is usually colored or etched to represent a wall or mountain range dividing the two sides. Each player has 12 pawns (colored stones or marbles are also used) to represent their soldiers or miners deployed on their side of the wall, leaving the last row of squares on each side empty at the start of the game.": "{@b The playing board}: 游戏在一个分为两半的棋盘上进行，每个棋盘由18个方块组成，中间有一排6个方块。6个四面骰子放在这中间的一排上，通常用颜色或蚀刻来代表分隔两边的墙或山脉。每个玩家有12个棋子（也可使用彩色石头或弹珠），代表他们部署在墙那边的士兵或矿工，游戏开始时，每边的最后一排格子是空的。",
	"{@b The rules}: A coin toss decides who starts as the attacking player. The other defends. On his turn, the attacking player roles a d4 to score a hit against one of the pieces of wall (or mountain range) damaging it and taking points off it equal to the scored result. A score of 4 or higher removes that piece of wall, allowing pawns to start moving through. The attacking player may choose which part of the wall it hits, as long as he has a pawn directly in front of it. On his turn, the defending player makes the same roll, but can use the score to repair a piece of the wall. Once a breach in the wall has been made, each player can choose (on their turn) to move one pawn to the other side of the board, by rolling the die. The result determines how many squares the pawn may move. A move is only allowed when a pawn ends on an empty square. If it does and passes an opponent's pawn this way, it kills the pawn in the process. Diagonal moves are allowed.": "{@b The rules}: 抛硬币决定谁开始作为进攻方。另一方进行防守。在他的回合中，进攻方扮演一个D4角色，对其中一块墙（或山脉）进行打击，破坏它，并从它身上拿走与得分结果相等的分数。4分或更高的分数会移除那块墙，允许棋子开始移动。攻击方可以选择击中墙的哪一部分，只要他有一个棋子在墙的正前方。在他的回合中，防守方进行同样的掷骰子，但可以用分数来修复一块墙。一旦墙被攻破，每个玩家都可以选择（在他们的回合）通过掷骰子将一个卒子移到棋盘的另一边。掷骰子的结果决定了这个卒子可以移动多少个格子。只有当卒子在一个空位上结束时，才允许移动。如果它这样做了，并且通过了对手的卒子，那么在这个过程中就会杀死这个卒子。对角线的移动是允许的。",
	"{@b Winning}: The winner is determined by whoever has the most pawns on the last square line of the opponent's board, minus any casualties. The game ends when there are no more pawns are on the board, or all remaining pawns have reached the last row of the opponent's side": "{@b Winning}: 谁在对方棋盘的最后一格线上有最多的棋子，减去任何伤亡，谁就能决定胜负。当棋盘上不再有棋子，或所有剩余的棋子都到达对方的最后一行时，游戏结束。",
