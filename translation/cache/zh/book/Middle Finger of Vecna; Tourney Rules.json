	"Have you ever wanted to feature a medieval tournament in your game with knights and jousting, but stopped yourself because the it'd be a pain to come up with new game mechanics to support it? WELL FRET YE NOT , FAIR MAIDEN, for I have done the hard work for you! Read on, and discover simpleyet-effective rules for running your very own tourney...": "你是否曾经想在你的游戏中加入骑士和比武的中世纪比赛，但却因为要想出新的游戏机制来支持它而止步不前？好了，别担心，亲爱的女士，我已经为你做了艰苦的工作! 请继续阅读，并发现简单而有效的规则来运行你自己的巡回赛......",
	"The centrepiece of any tourney is the chaotic brawl known as the 'melee'. In this massive fight, where dozens or even hundreds of warriors fight it out with sword, axe and mace, combat is governed by strict rules of chivalry, and killing your foes is disallowed. Melee is divided into Free-for-All, in which the last contestant standing wins, and the Team contests, where warriors are split into two sides that engage each other in formation. Team melees, are further divided into mounted and dismounted battles - mounted fights are generally preferred by audiences, but may not be feasible if there is a shortage of knights or warhorses.": "任何巡回赛的核心是被称为 \"混战 \"的混乱争斗。在这场大规模的战斗中，几十个甚至几百个战士用剑、斧头和狼牙棒进行战斗，战斗受到严格的骑士精神规则的约束，不允许杀死你的敌人。混战分为自由搏击和团队竞赛，前者是最后站立的选手获胜，后者则是战士们分成两方，以队形相互交战。团队近战又分为骑马和不骑马的战斗--观众一般喜欢骑马的战斗，但如果缺少骑士或战马，可能就不可行了。",
	"In a melee, fighters must wield melee weapons, though thrown weapons such as javelins may be permitted. It is most unchivalrous to use lethal force in a melee (though accidents can happen) and anyone seen striking an opponent who is on the ground will be disqualified and ejected from the arena. Magic is usually restricted to magic items only, though some melees may allow spells with a range of touch or self to be used.": "在近战中，选手必须使用近战武器，但也允许使用标枪等投掷武器。在近战中使用致命武力是非常不道德的（尽管意外可能发生），任何被看到打击倒在地上的对手的人都会被取消资格并被驱逐出赛场。魔法通常只限于魔法物品，但有些混战可能允许使用范围为触摸或自身的法术。",
	"Fighters may voluntarily retire from a melee at any stage by taking an action on their turn to lay down their weapons and declare themselves out of action. Anyone who attacks a retired fighter will be disqualified.": "斗士可以在任何阶段自愿退出混战，在他们的回合中采取行动，放下他们的武器并宣布自己退出行动。任何攻击退役战士的人都将被取消资格。",
	"You can perform this action on a prone opponent within 5 feet of you, as long as you are not within the reach of any standing opponents. When you take the Eliminate action, the target is immediately disqualified from the melee and must drop their weapons at the next opportunity and leave the fighting area by the shortest available route. Anyone who attacks an eliminated combatant will also be disqualified.": "只要你不在任何站立对手的范围内，你就可以对你5英尺内的俯卧对手执行这个动作。当你采取消除行动时，目标会立即被取消近战资格，并且必须在下一次机会中放下武器，以最短的可用路线离开战斗区域。任何攻击被淘汰的战斗人员的人也将被取消资格。",
	"Before the fight, determine the number of fighters (including the PCs) that will be participating. To calculate this quickly, you can roll 12d10 or 1d12*10 (minimum 40). Melee fighters will be a mixture of warriors; you may wish to use the knight, veteran, thug and berserker stat blocks to represent them.": "在战斗之前，确定将参加战斗的战士（包括NPC）的数量。为了快速计算，你可以滚动12d10或1d12*10（最少40）。近战战士将是战士的混合体；你可能希望使用骑士、老兵、暴徒和狂战士的状态块来代表他们。",
	"Though the melee is large and filled with combatants, the players will only attract the attention of a few enemies at a time while many more fight and are eliminated elsewhere in the brawl. Therefore, the player's battle takes place within a 25 ft. x 25 ft. square area of the arena - one of many such areas - wherein enemy combatants routinely surge. If a PC exits this area while there are other combatants in the arena, they provoke an opportunity attack from a random combatant for every 10 feet they travel.": "虽然近战规模很大，而且充满了战斗人员，但玩家每次只会吸引几个敌人的注意，而更多的敌人则在争斗的其他地方战斗并被消灭。因此，玩家的战斗发生在竞技场的一个25英尺×25英尺的方形区域内--许多这样的区域之一--敌人的战斗人员经常会涌入这里。如果一个人在竞技场内有其他战斗人员时离开这个区域，他们每走10英尺就会引起一个随机战斗人员的一次机会攻击。",
	"At the beginning of the melee, and at the beginning of each turn of combat, roll 1d8. That many enemies enter the player's section of the arena on that turn (provided there is space for them to enter at the periphery of the arena). This is called a Melee Round. The battle has a number of Melee Rounds based upon the number of fighters in the brawl. To determine the number of Melee Rounds, divide the total number of fighters by 2 (rounding down, if necessary), and continue dividing by 2 until the result is 1 or lower. The number of times you divided to reach this result is the number of Melee Rounds.": "在近战开始时，以及在每一回合的战斗开始时，滚动1d8。在该回合中，有这么多的敌人进入玩家的竞技场区域（只要在竞技场的外围有空间让他们进入）。这被称为一个近战回合。战斗的近战回合数是根据争斗中的战士数量而定的。要确定近战回合数，需要用战士总数除以2（必要时向下取整），然后继续除以2，直到结果为1或更低。你除以这个结果的次数就是近战回合的数量。",
	"After the Melee Rounds are complete, the PCs still have to contend with the remaining combatants in the arena, possibly including each other, before the melee is complete.": "在近战回合结束后，在近战结束前，NPC仍然要与竞技场上剩余的战斗人员（可能包括彼此）进行较量。",
	"In a Free-for-All melee, all enemy combatants that enter combat on a melee round are hostile to the party, whereas in Team melee, only half are hostile, whereas the other half are friendly, and will fight alongside that party. Free-for-All melee continues until only one combatant is left standing, whereas Team melee continues until only one team remains.": "在自由混战中，所有进入混战回合的敌方战斗人员都对本方有敌意，而在团队混战中，只有一半是有敌意的，而另一半是友好的，并将与本方一起战斗。自由混战一直持续到只剩下一个战斗人员，而团队混战则一直持续到只剩下一个团队。",
	"One of the most spectacular sights at a tourney is the thunderous crash of lance against shield that signifies a pair of knights tilting at each other in a joust. At a tourney, jousts are usually held as part of a knockout competition where winning knights advance through a series of rounds until just two finalists are left to compete for the prize.": "巡回赛中最壮观的景象之一是长枪对盾牌的雷鸣般的撞击声，这意味着一对骑士在比武中相互倾轧。在巡回赛中，比武通常作为淘汰赛的一部分举行，获胜的骑士通过一系列的比赛晋级，直到只剩下两个决赛选手来争夺奖金。",
	"Jousts are conducted as a set number of charges (usually 3), ending early if a rider is unhorsed and thus automatically defeated. If neither rider is unhorsed after 3 rounds, the winner is decided by points, with 1 point scored for each accurate hit on the opponent's shield and 2 points for each lance broken against the opponent. If the result is still a tie, the audience will vote on a winner. Local heroes, charismatic fan favourites and well-groomed horses have a clear edge if it comes down to a vote.": "比武以设定的冲锋次数进行（通常为3次），如果有骑手未骑马，则提前结束，从而自动落败。如果3轮过后，两个骑手都没有骑马，则以积分决定胜负，每准确击中对手的盾牌得1分，每折断对手的长矛得2分。如果结果仍是平局，观众将投票决定胜负。如果要投票的话，当地的英雄、有魅力的粉丝喜欢的人和精心打扮的马匹都有明显的优势。",
	"For each charge, initiative is determined by a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Attacks are then made as normal against the target's AC, and any damage that would be dealt on a hit is instead dealt to the lance. Tourney lances have 10 HP and are replaced after each charge even if not broken. It should be noted that if the knight going second is unhorsed, they cannot attack, and they have disadvantage on their attack if they were struck but not unhorsed. If the initiative roll is tied, both characters attack at the same time and either or both could potentially be unhorsed. Characters with the Extra Attack feature cannot use it in a joust, but characters with the Mounted Combatant feat have advantage on the attack roll.": "对于每次冲锋，主动权由智慧（动物处理）检查决定。然后按照正常的方式对目标的AC进行攻击，任何被击中的伤害都会对长矛造成伤害。巡回赛长矛有10个HP，每次冲锋后都会被替换，即使没有被打破。需要注意的是，如果第二个上场的骑士没有被击中，他们就不能攻击，如果他们被击中但没有被击中，他们的攻击就有劣势。如果主动权卷轴打成平手，则两个角色同时攻击，其中一个或两个都有可能被解马。具有额外攻击功能的角色不能在比武中使用，但具有骑马战斗者特技的角色在攻击卷上有优势。",
	"If a knight is hit, they must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to the damage rolled. On a failure, they are unhorsed. When a rider is unhorsed, they make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone and are stunned for one round after falling. If the save is failed by 5 or more, the rider also suffers a {@table random lingering injury|lingering injury|DMG} as per the table on page 272 of the DMG.": "如果一个骑士被击中，他们必须做一个力量救赎，其DC等于所受的伤害。如果失败，他们就会被卸下马匹。当骑士被解开时，他们必须做一个DC15的灵巧蓄力动作。如果失败，他们就会倒下，并且在倒下后被击晕一回合。如果救赎失败5次或更多，骑手也会受到{@table random lingering injury|lingering injury|DMG}的伤害，如DMG第272页的表格所示。",
	"A particularly noble and genteel crowd might object to the violence and danger inherent in regular jousting, preferring instead that the knights demonstrate their grace and finesse by spearing a series of hanging rings.": "一个特别高贵和有风度的人群可能会反对常规比武中固有的暴力和危险，而更喜欢骑士们通过刺穿一系列吊环来展示他们的优雅和狡猾。",
	"In ring jousting, knights take turns to complete a course that features a number of set of rings. They have to choose whether to aim at the larger, smaller or medium sized ring from each set. The largest ring has and AC of 12 and is worth 1 point, the medium ring has an AC of 15 and is worth 2 points and the smallest ring has an AC of 18 and is worth 3 points. The knight with the most points at the end of the course wins. Knights must use their Dexterity instead of Strength to attack when jousting at rings.": "在擂台比武中，骑士们轮流完成一个具有若干套擂台的课程。他们必须选择是否瞄准每组中较大、较小或中等大小的环。最大的环的AC为12，价值1分，中等环的AC为15，价值2分，最小的环的AC为18，价值3分。课程结束时，积分最多的骑士获胜。骑士在擂台比武时必须使用他们的灵巧而不是力量来进行攻击。",
	"On the other hand, some crowds want to see blood. Jousting can be made much grittier and more dangerous by having the knights continue to fight on foot after one has been unhorsed.": "另一方面，有些观众希望看到流血。比武可以通过让骑士在一个人被卸下马后继续步行战斗而变得更加狡猾和危险。",
	"In these extended bouts, a mounted knight must dismount immediately when their opponent is unhorsed - it should be assumed that the horse moves 60 feet before the rider's next turn, though they can attempt to dismount halfway through this move as a reaction to seeing their opponent fall with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (on a failure, they fall prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage). They must then draw a melee weapon (usually a longsword or a mace) and continue the fight on foot until one of the knights yields or is knocked unconscious.": "在这些长时间的战斗中，当他们的对手被卸下马时，骑马的骑士必须立即下马--应该假定马在骑手的下一个回合之前移动了60英尺，尽管他们可以尝试在这个移动的中途下马，作为看到他们的对手倒下的反应，成功地进行DC 15灵巧（杂技）检查（如果失败，他们会倒地并受到2d6重击的伤害）。然后他们必须拔出近战武器（通常是长剑或狼牙棒），继续步行战斗，直到其中一个骑士屈服或被击倒。",
	"The melee and the jousting are the main events at a tourney. However, both of these events are relatively short-lived, and insufficient to occupy hundreds or even thousands of visitors for the duration of the show. Thus, an assortment of sideactivities are laid on, such as the following...": "混战和比武是巡回赛的主要项目。然而，这两项活动都是相对短暂的，不足以让数百甚至数千名游客在整个表演期间都能得到满足。因此，会有各种各样的辅助活动，例如以下活动......",
	"While competition in melee and jousting events is restricted to knights and nobles only, archery contests are usually open to all, including commoners and children. This makes them one of the very few means by which a commoner can come to the attention of powerful people - and even a modest cash prize is sure to generate lots of interest.": "虽然近战和比武的比赛只限于骑士和贵族，但射箭比赛通常对所有人开放，包括平民和儿童。这使得它们成为平民可以引起有权势的人注意的极少数手段之一--即使是适度的现金奖励也肯定会引起很多人的兴趣。",
	"Archery contests are usually organised as three-round elimination tournaments where archers are split into lines and the highest-scoring archer (sometimes the top two) from each line advances to one of two semi-finals. Then the winners of each semi-final face off one-on-one for the grand prize. In each round, the archers fire 6 arrows at a target 60 ft. away (though the range can vary - junior contests are usually shorter and grand finals often longer). Archers must use either shortbows or longbows; crossbows and other weapons are not allowed in archery contests.": "射箭比赛通常以三轮淘汰赛的形式进行，弓箭手被分成几条线，每条线中得分最高的弓箭手（有时是前两名）进入两场半决赛中的一场。然后每场半决赛的获胜者一对一地对决，争夺大奖。在每一轮比赛中，弓箭手向60英尺外的目标发射6支箭（尽管射程可能有所不同 - 初级比赛通常较短，总决赛通常较长）。弓箭手必须使用短弓或长弓；弩和其他武器不允许参加射箭比赛。",
	"Points are scored according to the accuracy of the shot, determined by the archer's attack roll: 1 for white (AC 10), 2 for black (AC 12), 3 for blue (AC 14), 4 for red (AC 16), 5 for yellow (AC 18). When contests are held outdoors, there is a risk of sudden gusts of wind. The DM may therefore roll a d20 each round; all archers have disadvantage on their next shot if the result is a 20.": "分数是根据射击的准确性来决定的，由弓箭手的攻击卷决定。1为白色（AC 10），2为黑色（AC 12），3为蓝色（AC 14），4为红色（AC 16），5为黄色（AC 18）。当比赛在户外举行时，有可能会出现突然的大风。因此，DM可以在每一轮掷出一个D20；如果结果是20，所有的弓箭手在下一次射击时都有劣势。",
	"Some tourneys have a prize for the best-dressed lord or lady. This can get just as competitive as the jousting, and the rewards can be just as big - aside from the winner's pot of cash, this is also an excellent way to attract high-class suitors.": "一些巡回赛为穿得最漂亮的领主或夫人设置了奖项。这可能会像比武一样竞争激烈，奖励也同样丰厚--除了赢家的现金罐，这也是吸引高级求婚者的绝佳方式。",
	"Commoners, that is, anyone without a Scroll of Pedigree, will not be considered for this contest but, once one is in contention, anything goes. The winner should be determined by combining three numbers into a total score: a) the cost of their outfit in gp, up to a maximum of 50, b) a Charisma (Performance) check, to demonstrate how well they carried off their look and c) an Intelligence (History) check, to represent how well the contestant is following the current trends and fashions.": "平民，也就是没有血统卷轴的人，将不被考虑参加这次比赛，但是，一旦参加比赛，什么都可以。赢家应该由三个数字组合成一个总分来决定：a）他们的服装成本（Gp），最多50；b）魅力（表现）检查，以证明他们的造型有多好；c）智力（历史）检查，以代表参赛者对当前趋势和时尚的关注程度。",
	"No tourney would be complete without a lively betting market! Jousting, in particular, with its clear winners, quick results and frequent upsets is perfect for gambling. If a player wants to bet on a joust between two knights that are not equally matched, odds should be calculated as follows:": "如果没有活跃的博彩市场，任何巡回赛都是不完整的！尤其是比武，它有明确的赢家，快速的结果和频繁的颠覆。特别是比武，由于其明显的赢家，快速的结果和频繁的颠覆，非常适合于赌博。如果玩家想在两个不相上下的骑士之间的比武上下注，赔率应按以下方式计算。",
	"1. Compare the knights' strength modifier. For each point of difference, give the stronger knight 1 'edge point'.": "1. 比较骑士的力量修正值。每有一点差异，就给较强的骑士1个 \"边缘点\"。",
	"2. If one knight has the Mounted Combatant feat and the other doesn't, give the feat-holder 1 edge point.": "2. 如果一个骑士有骑兵特技，而另一个没有，给特技持有者1个优势点。",
	"3. If one knight has proficiency in Strength saves and the other doesn't, give the proficient knight 1 edge point.": "3. 如果一个骑士精通力量救赎而另一个没有，给精通的骑士1个优势点。",
	"4. Compare the edge point totals and note the difference. The one with more points is the favourite.": "4. 比较边缘的总分，并注意其中的差别。得分多的是最受欢迎的。",
	"5. The underdog's odds should be X:2, where X is equal to 2 plus 1 for the first edge point of difference plus 2 for each subsequent edge point.": "5. 劣势方的赔率应该是X:2，其中X等于2加1的第一个边缘点的差异，再加2的每个后续边缘点。",
	"6. The favourite's odds are the inverse of the underdog's.": "6. 喜爱者的赔率是劣势者的反比。",
	"Worked example: Knight A has a Strength score of 20, proficiency in Strength saves and the Mounted Combatant feat. Knight B has 16 Strength and neither of those things. Knight A therefore has 4 edge points over Knight B. Knight B's odds are therefore set at 9:2 and Knight A's odds are 2:9. If a player bet 9 gold and Knight A, who then went on to win, the player would receive 11 gold back from the bookmaker.": "实例。骑士A的力量值为20，熟练掌握力量救赎和骑兵特技。骑士B的力量值为16，这些都不是。因此，骑士A比骑士B有4个优势点，骑士B的赔率因此定为9：2，骑士A的赔率为2：9。如果玩家下注9个金币和骑士A，然后骑士A赢了，玩家将从庄家那里得到11个金币的回报。",
	"Note that this calculation does not produce precise odds, nor does it take into account smaller factors like differences in the knights' proficiency bonuses or Animal Handling scores. Calculating precise odds is mathematically complex and, more importantly, beyond the capabilities of the average NPC bookmaker.": "请注意，这种计算并不能产生精确的赔率，也没有考虑到更小的因素，如骑士的熟练度奖励或动物处理分数的差异。计算精确的赔率在数学上很复杂，更重要的是，超出了一般NPC赌徒的能力。",
	"When tourneys are held far away from the big cities, it is possible that large sections of the audience have never seen a wizard or bard in their lives. Therefore, it is not unusual for spellcasters to travel out to big tourneys in order to supplement their incomes. A PC with the ability to play an instrument or cast illusion spells can spend their time at the tourney entertaining crowds - and come home with a fistful of silver for their troubles. Performers can expect to earn an amount of gp equal to 1d8 + their Charisma modifier per hour, but spellcasters must expend one spell slot (of any level) for each hour of performance.": "当巡回赛在远离大城市的地方举行时，很大一部分观众有可能一辈子都没有见过巫师或吟游诗人。因此，施法者为了补充他们的收入而外出参加大型巡回赛的情况并不罕见。一个有能力演奏乐器或施展幻觉法术的人可以在巡回赛上花时间招待观众--并带着一拳头的银子回家解决麻烦。表演者每小时可以赚取相当于1d8+他们的魅力修正值的金币，但施法者每小时的表演必须消耗一个法术槽（任何级别）。",
	"Arm Wrestling is a fairly straightforward challenge between two contestants. Each round, the contestants make opposed Strength (Athletics) checks. The first contestant to beat his opponent in two consecutive Strength checks wins the pot (10 cp).": "掰手腕是两个参赛者之间一个相当直接的挑战。每一轮，参赛者进行对抗性的力量（运动）检查。第一个在连续两次力量检查中击败对手的选手赢得奖金（10cp）。",
	"NPC opponents have a +2 Strength modifier.": "NPC对手有一个+2的力量修改器。",
	"Anyone who wishes may make a guess as to the number of beans contained within a filled jar. Each contestant may only make a single guess.": "任何人都可以猜测一个装满豆子的瓶子里有多少豆子。每位参赛者只能做一次猜测。",
	"At the end of the festival the beans are counted, and the contestant with the highest Wisdom (Perception) check wins. Most contestants are way off, but there are three NPC contestants worth rolling for. These contestants have an Wisdom (Perception)  bonus of +4.": "在节日结束时，豆子被计算出来，智慧（感知）检查最高的参赛者获胜。大多数参赛者都很差劲，但有三个NPC参赛者值得一试。这些参赛者的智慧（感知）奖励为+4。",
	"The winner takes the pot, usually 40 cp for 40 total contestants.": "赢家拿走彩金，通常是40个参赛者的40cp。",
	"A small mechanical or magical table is set up in front of the contestant. Every few seconds, a clockwork or illusory rat appears in one of the 9 holes in the table. The contestant must bop the rat with a small club before the rat disappears.": "在参赛者面前摆放一张机械或魔法的小桌子。每隔几秒钟，桌子上的9个洞中的一个就会出现一只发条的或虚幻的老鼠。参赛者必须在老鼠消失之前用一根小棍子敲打老鼠。",
	"The first rat requires a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to bop. Each subsequent rat appears at a faster pace, and the DC increases by +2. The game is over when the contestant fails a Dexterity saving throw, and he is awarded 1 cp for each rat he bops. Typically, the first time a contestant bops five or more rats in a single game he is no longer allowed to play.": "第一只老鼠需要一个DC10的灵巧救赎来敲打。之后的每只老鼠都会以更快的速度出现，DC也会增加+2。当参赛者的灵巧投掷失败时，游戏就结束了，他每击中一只老鼠就会得到1cp。通常情况下，参赛者第一次在一场比赛中拍打五只或更多的老鼠，他就不再被允许参加比赛。",
	"The lucky contestant is led into a muddy arena with a greased pig, where he has one minute to catch and tie up his squealing prey. Each round that the pig is loose, the contestant must make a DC 10 Acrobatics to catch the pig. On a success, the contestant must successfully grapple the pig (use boar statistics). If the contestant successfully pins the pig, the contest is over and the contestant wins 20 cp. If at any point the pig escapes, the contestant must begin the process anew.": "幸运的参赛者被带入一个泥泞的竞技场，里面有一头涂满油的猪，他有一分钟的时间来捕捉并绑住他尖叫的猎物。在猪松开的每一回合，参赛者必须使出DC10的杂技来抓猪。如果成功，参赛者必须成功抓住猪（使用野猪的统计数据）。如果参赛者成功地抓住了猪，比赛就结束了，参赛者赢得20cp。如果在任何时候猪逃跑了，参赛者必须重新开始这个过程。",
	"If the pig dies or falls unconscious, the contestant will likely be ejected from the festival (though the barbequist will appreciate the extra meat).": "如果猪死了或失去知觉，参赛者很可能会被赶出节日（尽管烧烤师会感谢额外的肉）。",
	"Challenges of Toasts are less structured than many other games around the festival, and usually break out unmoderated around the beer kegs. Two individuals make toasts of increasing verbosity to life, the king, the gods, their opponent, or anything else that strikes their fancy.": "敬酒的挑战比节日期间的许多其他游戏结构更少，通常在啤酒桶周围爆发，不受约束。两个人对生命、国王、众神、他们的对手或其他任何让他们感兴趣的东西进行越来越多的敬酒。",
	"At the start of the challenge of toasts, both contestants put 5 cp into the pot. They then make opposed Charisma (Persuasion) checks to bring the crowd to their side. Before each Charisma check, the contestant may make a DC 10 Intelligence check improve their toast by throwing in a related fact. On a failure, they suffer disadvantage on their Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they gain advantage on their check.": "在敬酒挑战开始时，两位参赛者都往锅里放5cp。然后，他们进行相反的魅力（说服力）检查，以使众人站到他们一边。在每次魅力检查之前，参赛者可以进行DC10智力检查，通过抛出一个相关的事实来改善他们的敬酒。如果失败，他们的魅力（说服力）检查就会处于劣势。成功时，他们在检查中获得优势。",
	"The contest is over when a contestant beats his opponent's check by 10 or more, and the winner takes the whole pot. However, the loser may quickly try to impress the crowd with his brazen ways by adding enough coin into the pot to double it. If the winner matches this doubling, then the game continues. If the winner refuses to match the doubling, then the game is over and both parties receive what they put in. The pot may only be doubled three times by each contestant each game.": "当一个参赛者以10个或更多的点数击败对手的支票时，比赛就结束了，获胜者拿走整个彩池。然而，输家可以迅速尝试用他厚颜无耻的方式来打动观众，在彩池中加入足够的硬币来翻倍。如果赢家符合这个翻倍的条件，那么游戏继续。如果赢家拒绝翻倍，那么游戏就结束了，双方都会得到他们投入的钱。每位参赛者每局只能翻三倍。",
	"Typical opponents have Persuasion +3 and a +2 Intelligence modifier.": "典型的对手有说服力+3和智力+2的修改系数。",
	"Two contestants sit side by side, and cradle a burning coal between their forearms. Each round, they take 1 fire damage and must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. The first contestant to fail a Wisdom save yield, or fall unconscious loses, and the winner gains 4 cp. If they fail at the same time, the pot is split.": "两个参赛者并排坐着，在他们的前臂之间抱着一块燃烧的煤炭。每一轮，他们都会受到1次火的伤害，并且必须做一个DC10的智慧救赎动作。第一个在智慧救赎中失败，或昏迷的参赛者就输了，而赢家则获得4cp。如果他们同时失败，则分赃。",
	"If a contestant is undamaged by the coal, he does not make Wisdom saves, but must instead make DC 10 Charisma (Deception) checks each round to wince and grimace. If a contestant is found to be immune to the damage he will be ejected from the festival as if he had used magic to cheat (even if no magic was involved).": "如果参赛者没有受到煤炭的伤害，他不需要进行智慧救赎，而是必须在每一回合进行DC10魅力（欺骗）检查，以使其畏缩和面无表情。如果参赛者被发现对伤害免疫，他将被驱逐出庆典，就像他使用魔法作弊一样（即使没有涉及魔法）。",
	"A  hand crossbow is affixed to the front of a stand, and a magically enchanted toy duck dances in the air 10 feet beyond. The contestant has three bolts with which to hit the toy duck's AC 18.

	"{@i Price}: None": "{@i Price}: 无",
	"Light Show is a casual, entertaining game usually judged by children (at least, in towns where magic is not heresy). There is only one light show per festival, usually after dinner.

Each contestant makes a single Intelligence (Arcana) check to craft an entertaining or fascinating light show, and the contestant with the highest Spellcraft check wins 1sp.": "灯光秀是一种休闲、娱乐的游戏，通常由儿童评判（至少，在魔法不是异端的城镇）。每个节日只有一次灯光秀，通常在晚餐后。任何能够使用舞动的灯光、光线、预言术或类似的持久性光线或幻觉效果的选手都可以参赛。每个参赛者进行一次智力（阿卡纳）检查，以制作一个娱乐性的或迷人的灯光秀，法术检查最高的参赛者赢得1分。",

	"Question Quest is one of the more complex and cerebral games available at local festivals. Up to four teams of up to six individuals each square off in a test of knowledge.
